[0:04:40] <redwilt> I'm glad I can finally catch a stream live
[0:04:40] <Exiliator> I hope he switches to japanese at some point
[0:04:41] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @gnarly_memes_bro But his appearnce in this elimnated any emotion the ending could have had if the focus had been on Trilla instead.
[0:04:43] <Dio_TR> Woolie has studied his nindo
[0:04:47] <%gatorafan> Woolie plz, I was listening to your Guilty Gear cast woolieF woolieU
[0:04:49] <ggbhtg> and does the chat ACTUALLY know what happens in this game and not the anime?!

[0:05:09] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @ggbhtg I am all knowing personally
[0:05:13] <odd_slater> MEGALOBOX SEASON 2 HYPE
[0:05:15] <BigNerdSam> @ggbhtg the Naruto scars run deep.
[0:05:18] <+Stupid121v2> One of the coolest things about the war was using Shika's dad to plan the battle and have Ino's dad and fam transfer the orders into the battalions
[0:05:28] <+CoronetChris> He would have the rap from MegaloBox.
[0:05:29] <etbarni> O.o
[0:05:45] <+amiroodude> Megalobox is so sick
[0:05:55] <@mothmandraws> I cant remember how many episodes I gave naruto
[0:05:58] <Ultrahalda> THE KING OF KINGS
[0:06:01] <@mothmandraws> I watched until gaara was around
[0:06:05] <Ultrahalda> YURI
[0:06:07] <AMstone776> like NUNS3 has some good moments but NUNS4 has hype a fuck moments

[0:07:17] <gnarly_memes_bro> I never actually watched naruto, I only read it once I started hearing about the trainwtreck ending. I was a one piece kid lmao
[0:07:22] <ggbhtg> Night Court - OP1
[0:07:23] <AMstone776> I remember when the manga was ending me and my college buddies read it and laughed.
[0:07:25] <+CoronetChris> @gatorafan Same
[0:07:44] <Iggeh0> Sasuke did nothing wrong
[0:07:51] <DemonicHoward> i just watched all the ops and that got me back in finishes the series in about a month
[0:07:59] <gnarly_memes_bro> Sasuke might have done a couple things wrong
[0:08:03] <+Stupid121v2> He attempted to do wrong badly
[0:08:10] <Ultrahalda> You mean he did everything wrong
[0:08:13] <$BallerSwagBro9k> GERUDO VALLEY
[0:08:15] <+amiroodude> Woolie should have an opening ending reaction on stream
[0:08:17] <Dio_TR> Sasuke killed all those people FOR A BETTER FUTURE LUL
[0:08:21] <ggbhtg> seriously though, the game hasn't even explained awakening or red life overcharge stuffs
[0:08:24] <+CoronetChris> Garudo Valley, nice.
[0:08:30] <ggbhtg> so no booli wooli
[0:08:35] <+metzselaar> Sasuke was created to do wrong
[0:08:45] <Dovakhin573> Man the next part of this game actually almost had me teary eyed
[0:08:45] <Doodle_Taco> Is Ganondorf the true Kazekage?
[0:08:53] <AMstone776> the anime does something nice though. like they adapted the books that happened after the ending. like the last 5 episodes are really good.
[0:08:58] <BalloniWright> Is that Megalobox Season 2 reveal real? I just saw that PogChamp NotLikeThis
[0:09:10] <ggbhtg> somebody could donate a tip about Awakening, though.... not my broke need a new job ass though
[0:09:10] <gnarly_memes_bro> @ggbhtg its a little frustrating when you consider how many character forms/ changes are locked behind awakenings in these games
[0:09:11] <+amiroodude> @BalloniWright yup@ :)
[0:09:18] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Yo this cover is FIRE
[0:09:51] <gnarly_memes_bro> LIKE would Danzo's arm even have come up in the fight if he hadn't awakened?
[0:09:56] <ggbhtg> somebody told him about chakra dash cancels in the donation before the last stream
[0:09:58] <mdkcde> what was wollie's anwer about the patreon thou?
[0:10:05] <AMstone776> like Naruto asking Iruka to be his dad at his ending was BibleThump

[0:11:14] <+CoronetChris> I sometimes wonder if the end of the series ended differently would I like Naruto more than I do.
[0:11:20] <Dovakhin573> but yeah I hope we get to "that" part today
[0:11:23] <mdkcde> Tobirama? He's the real shit
[0:11:30] <%JetpackMcQuack> woolieYE
[0:11:30] <Doodle_Taco> @stupid121v2 Glad to see I'm not the only one hoping for that
[0:11:36] <DemonicHoward> everything is tobiramas fault
[0:11:37] <%gatorafan> Gon in 60 seconds is lasting way longer than what was advertised daedra1DerpyTibs
[0:11:38] <mdkcde> I can't wait for that part
[0:11:39] <42nfl19> So do the Ultimate Ninja Storm games contain some of the filler stuff also?
[0:11:42] <ggbhtg> is HxH anime better than the manga in some way?
[0:11:43] <Kohei_kyouji> how far through the story are we at this point?
[0:11:48] <Dovakhin573> i know naruto has its issues but i really love the island arc
[0:11:49] <+Stupid121v2> The anime having Naruto asking Iruka to be his dad at the end almost made me cry lmao
[0:11:53] <AMstone776> oh we are going to get to some good stuff this stream.

[0:15:04] <ggbhtg> filler
[0:15:08] <Octopimp> woolie's chakra was too strong to fully steal
[0:15:18] <+Stupid121v2> One Piece Wano is a beauty to watch but LORD they're stretching pages to be episodes
[0:15:18] <Dio_TR> Why is Luffy so buff tho
[0:15:25] <Nina96> i dont wanna remember bleach
[0:15:28] <mdkcde> holy shit is boruto just filler

[0:15:35] <%Tenchi_G> Tenchi_G gifted a Tier 1 sub to Octopimp! This is their first Gift Sub in the channel! 
[0:15:37] <gnarly_memes_bro> @Octopimp you sealed half of the 9 dreaded beast within your own body
[0:15:42] <+Stupid121v2> 98% of Boruto anime is filler
[0:15:45] <bsmusic> Never watch Boruto

[0:16:08] <Dovakhin573> Luffy dint spend 2 years training not to get buff
[0:16:09] <+Stupid121v2> Hes gotta fight the big dude
[0:16:15] <%eldragon_1> I honestly wishOnePiece would switch to being seasonal
[0:16:15] <AMstone776> I may just tune in for the travel to the past bit but that's it for Boruto.
[0:16:16] <+CoronetChris> I maintain that Boruto would be better if it was called Sarada
[0:16:16] <Nina96> Is there anything good in Boruto?
[0:16:18] <MayShip> we're in a weird time where the manga and animes don't even agree with each other. like Boruto and DBS
[0:16:19] <wendigo172> The Bort manga is good imo
[0:16:21] <+sshen> sshen subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:16:21] <mdkcde> they spent an entire lenght time of Back to the future to get as afar as the same pointof BTTF 20 minutes into the movie
[0:16:29] <+gustavozxd> Woolie is gonna need to learn how to play this game, I mean it's simple as fuck but boy is he suffering way more than you need to
[0:16:30] <MetalDeerS0LID> thanks COPPA
[0:16:30] <+Stupid121v2> The bort manga is legit aight
[0:16:32] <@mothmandraws> if boruto went back in time and changes history, does he turn the whole of og naruto into filler
[0:16:34] <gnarly_memes_bro> @Stupid121v2 I got really busy while Luffy was in wano jail. how badly do i need to catch up?
[0:16:44] <+gustavozxd> 20 minutes in training mode you learn pretty much everything
[0:16:45] <DemonicHoward> bort manga needs to fix sadaras outfit

[0:17:06] <ggbhtg> One Piece shoulda been seasonal, cuz fuuuuck Wano makes everything look like visual filler
[0:17:06] <VidulaSaix> He doesn't need to learn shit to play through the story lol

[0:44:19] <+Shady_Zaku> I mean its SOMETHING
[0:44:21] <Mirakei> i think it's a VR game
[0:44:25] <Nina96> id rather forget it
[0:44:27] <%KoyFoster> Eh. It's just another VR game.
[0:44:31] <+Rabbitmage> Cool that there's a new HL but VR doesnt do FPS well
[0:44:32] <segbas2004> looks good, probably will play good too
[0:44:35] <+Stupid121v2> Its not 3
[0:44:36] <+Sento_vidya> Looks neat but no headset
[0:44:36] <chalkchugger> ech
[0:44:37] <fist_wizard_jay> I think the engine is pretty nut-worthy tho
[0:44:39] <gnarly_memes_bro> its a vr ghame they put the name half life on until i see more
[0:44:42] <fist_wizard_jay> like
[0:44:44] <shadic7700> Vote Char Armstrong!!!!
[0:44:44] <SomersaultJustice> we live in a society
[0:44:48] <$BallerSwagBro9k> FEEL THE SOCIETY
[0:44:49] <+Sento_vidya> wanted the PSVR one if any but that one barely works on PC
[0:44:50] <%JetpackMcQuack> If they don't intend to continue the story I'm not interested
[0:44:52] <reonome> never played half life lol
[0:44:56] <fist_wizard_jay> imagine pther games in that kind of engine
[0:44:59] <bsmusic> I don't think it's worth talking about until they release it personally
[0:45:00] <+AtomicVR> This is a big chat of people with no idea what VR is like lol
[0:45:03] <%gatorafan> I switched from my phone to my pc and now I can barely hear anything . _.
[0:45:04] <%ChoculaUltra> valve didn't realize that the word "flagship" before the term "VR" meant jackshit to actual fans of the Half-Life series lol
[0:45:09] <+Stupid121v2> Pat said how I feel, thanks for not touching on that 15 year cliffhanger
[0:45:09] <Arek_1> S O C I E T Y
[0:45:12] <fist_wizard_jay> also bsmusic, you are completely right
[0:45:15] <+Stupid121v2> feels GREAT
[0:45:24] <mankeyfigh> B A C K I NNNNNNNN
[0:45:24] <MemoryOfDust> yeah it's super cool that Valve doesnt put out a quality title in ages and then throws up a vr game with ancient assets. super cool lol
[0:45:29] <chalkchug> streamer is LATE
[0:45:33] <+AtomicVR> And you bet my name literally has VR in it so of course i'm shilling it, but fps is easily the best fit for VR
[0:45:36] <SilverFaustX> jaejaeStream
[0:45:41] <mankeymania> what a min
[0:45:42] <+AtomicVR> And horror.
[0:45:51] <MyNameIsRasus> Society stopped meaning Joker memes and started meaning Potemkin in my head
[0:45:52] <%ChoculaUltra> iirc, out of Steam's entire userbase, only .32% or less than 1% actually use VR so I have no idea who the target audience is for Alyx
[0:45:53] <segbas2004> please hold
[0:45:55] <+Stupid121v2> Like Alyx will prpbably be fun, it just will upset me lol
[0:46:02] <ggbhtg> wait a Minh
[0:46:02] <gnarly_memes_bro> I never claim to know anything about VR, just that its curently out of my range of affordable things
[0:46:13] <%JetpackMcQuack> It looks cool, it's just a shitty use of the half life IP to push hardware.
[0:46:18] <+Shady_Zaku> Oooo
[0:46:20] <olavdehn> SourPls
[0:46:23] <Reverend_Roscoe> so what's the deal with the 1.5 hour wait?

[0:46:30] <%gatorafan> Oh, now this sounds a lot better SourPls
[0:46:32] <+Rabbitmage> Zelda rave
[0:46:33] <$BallerSwagBro9k> LETS GOOOO
[0:46:34] <Nina96> vr still feels like a gimmick imo
[0:46:36] <+AtomicVR> I can't argue that, but i'm also a VR shill so i'm happy to have a system seller.
[0:46:39] <%alrobot2014> @Reverend_Roscoe technical difficulties
[0:46:39] <%ChoculaUltra> even for a VR game I'm super wary - these are the same dudes that thought Artifact was a good idea btw.
[0:46:49] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Its dangerous to go alone TAKE THIS
[0:46:52] <+CoronetChris> Let's go on an adventure!
[0:46:57] <+Sento_vidya> this is a now a music and chill study stream
[0:46:58] <Reverend_Roscoe> @alrobot2014 gotcha
[0:47:00] <NiktenKing> The part when Windwaker kicks in tho
[0:47:01] <MemoryOfDust> @atomicvr do you work for a VR studio or something?
[0:47:06] <prime_name> are we just going through Woolie's OST?
[0:47:12] <%ChoculaUltra> Lo-Fi Woolies to Chill & Study To Part 1.
[0:47:14] <Nina96> yeyeye
[0:47:15] <NarcissistCactus> PogChamp can we get to one hour
[0:47:16] <chalkchug> stream willbe boppin shortly
[0:47:20] <MyNameIsRasus> "Hey Zelda mind if I praise the Godesses?"
[0:47:24] <+AtomicVR> @MemoryOfDust Nah just a former VR streamer and early adopter
[0:47:24] <MajoraZ> Am I the only one who doesn't actually care about """VR games""", and just wants normal games with no actual design changes,\ where you can look around using VR
[0:47:32] <Andrei11Droasca> @alec_the_risktaker Takes time make that much trash to raise form
[0:47:33] <Psyramics> at this rate, pat's gonna start before woolie
[0:47:39] <Monkey_D_Judd> What is this? I need this.
[0:47:39] <fist_wizard_jay> lol
[0:47:40] <Nina96> this is just the sound track to woolies life
[0:47:48] <%ChoculaUltra> @MajoraZ yes! I feel like VR should be an added bonus, not like the entire shebang, ya know?
[0:47:53] <$BallerSwagBro9k> For anyone who likes these beats, check out JonnyAtma on Youtube. Hes really good
[0:48:05] <fist_wizard_jay> a soundtrack simply named ‘Woolie Woolsworth Madden’
[0:48:21] <fruit_pie_the_magician> VR has potential, but not as a walking simulator machine
[0:48:22] <Doodle_Taco> @ballerswagbro9k He's great!
[0:48:25] <+AtomicVR> That dancing gif was perfectly on time
[0:48:32] <%ChoculaUltra> best game to utilize VR imo, is the Zone of the Enders 2 remaster. They had a whole bonus mode where you could use a VR set to pilot Jehuty from the actual cockpit.
[0:48:42] <+chesterr01> welp...
[0:48:54] <ggbhtg> uh oh
[0:48:55] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[0:48:59] <Shishi1205> oh no
[0:49:00] <sage_of_eden> Best VR game is gal gun 2..... jk
[0:49:01] <%ChoculaUltra> I don't like that welp Reggie
[0:49:07] <+Stupid121v2> say it aint so
[0:49:12] <karanhw> VR without interesting input mode is trash
[0:49:14] <Shishi1205> did woolie read that hardtimes tweet
[0:49:15] <+chesterr01> yo I love weezer
[0:49:15] <+Shotgundam009> More gal gun
[0:49:16] <mayorrev> reggie whats happening
[0:49:16] <chalkchug> jermaSun LATE
[0:49:20] <+chesterr01> well the old stuff
[0:49:20] <NiktenKing> Here it comes guys!
[0:49:21] <+Stupid121v2> NAH
[0:49:24] <Personified134> VR is just two forced gimmicks, 3D vision and motion controls, jammed together; it won't last more than one console generation before its abandoned
[0:49:26] <ggbhtg> Windows Update ruined EVERYTHING?
[0:49:27] <Shishi1205> a direct attack as always
[0:49:28] <Personified134> this is my hot take and i'm sticking to it
[0:49:31] <NiktenKing> YEAH WINDWAKER
[0:49:31] <ggbhtg> AGAIN?
[0:49:38] <karanhw> half life Alexa is literally doom VR
[0:49:42] <danknugglit> CurseLit
[0:49:49] <Mirakei> Woolies stream is being sabotaged because of his claim that Gill killed Epstein
[0:49:49] <+xx123manxx> what an absolutely frigid take @Personified134
[0:50:01] <mayorrev> That Lucio cosplay still kicks ass
[0:50:07] <+Shotgundam009> Nah were definitely passed the gimmick age of vr
[0:50:11] <+supaXmugen> @Personified134 hate to tell you but its here to stay. but not for the reason you think
[0:50:22] <%This_is_Marco> @supaXmugen LUL
[0:50:29] <Mirakei> Porn will carry VR
[0:50:39] <+supaXmugen> Graphics have gone as far as they can go without getting into uncanny valley territory.

[0:51:23] <+AtomicVR> MOVE FAST BABY DONT BE SLOW (to start the stream)

[0:51:37] <mayorrev> SourPls SourPls SourPls
[0:51:39] <+supaXmugen> This isnt Devil Trigger Opera. DansGame
[0:51:40] <chalkchug> he's just playing music and is in the chat right now
[0:51:46] <bsmusic> @narcissistcactus I refuse
[0:51:57] <VyperVic> @narcissistcactus wrong
[0:52:06] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Check out Little V's Red Sun and come back
[0:52:09] <MemoryOfDust> alright y'all you guys can like or dislike little V but let's not insult him or be mean. the man is a working musician, it's tough out there. give him a break.
[0:52:14] <dundore77> is there a place you can find all the songs woolie has during his getting ready stuff
[0:52:22] <MyNameIsRasus> ALL OF THESE VOICES INSIDE MY HEAD
[0:52:26] <fist_wizard_jay> LittleV out there doing work
[0:52:27] <BalloniWright> "r/sings devil trigger" is the best version of devil trigger
[0:52:30] <%gatorafan> manesi1Velfeelsgood Not my favorite version of the song, but it'll do
[0:52:30] <mayorrev> BANG BANG BANG
[0:52:32] <$BallerSwagBro9k> PULL MY DEVIL TRIGGER
[0:52:32] <SomersaultJustice> woolie played some naruto episodes to test the stream and now he's just watching them and forgot about us
[0:52:33] <NiktenKing> PULL MY DEVIL TRIGGER
[0:52:33] <%Crashfan01> FRUSTRATION IS GETTING BIGGER
[0:52:35] <chalkchug> he's probs talked about each of these songs several times
[0:52:36] <Doodle_Taco> BANG BANG BANG
[0:52:36] <mayorrev> SourPls
[0:52:39] <fruit_pie_the_magician> this isn't bad, but it's not as good as the original. in most ways, any way
[0:52:43] <Personified134> I think you wrote /r instead of /v/ by accident
[0:52:44] <Andrei11Droasca> This song gives me sexual powers SwiftRage
[0:52:46] <lotharrio> I think I prefer it with the lady singing.
[0:52:53] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @fruit_pie_the_magician True but still hype
[0:52:54] <+supaXmugen> @MemoryOfDust most "hobby ocupations" are.
[0:52:54] <Kohei_kyouji> ^
[0:52:54] <+Stupid121v2> I like his remixes well enough but I more respect just his actual musical talent
[0:52:55] <chalkchug> Devil Trigger always felt too poppy for me tbh
[0:53:02] <BalloniWright> */v/ sings devil trigger
[0:53:02] <+thatfig> how long is the stream gonna be?
[0:53:06] <fist_wizard_jay> what about the Teppen version?
[0:53:06] <+coolthulhuu> yeah this version is trash
[0:53:08] <MemoryOfDust> @supaxmugen what's your point?
[0:53:10] <+Aldesso> this is just an exuce for woolie to show us his superior taste in music
[0:53:13] <Personified134> V is a great guitarist but he only has one vocal style and it really doesn't work for most of the stuff he covers
[0:53:28] <Mirakei> i don't mind metal music but i'm not a fan of metal singing, for the most part
[0:53:40] <Doodle_Taco> @personified134 Its just different tastes man
[0:53:40] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Mas the song just blatanly gave the twist away LUL
[0:53:42] <Frostydough1> @Personified134 completly agree but this version sounds much better than when i first heard it i must admit
[0:53:42] <+supaXmugen> @MemoryOfDust none, just pointing it out.
[0:53:45] <$BallerSwagBro9k> PULL MY DEVIL TRIGGER
[0:53:49] <%gatorafan> Play Subhuman SwiftRage
[0:53:56] <MyNameIsRasus> YOU CANNOT KILL ME
[0:53:56] <chalkchug> now that depends on what you mean by metal singing @Mirakei
[0:53:58] <+Shotgundam009> I'm still upset what they did to cerberus theme in 5
[0:53:58] <mayorrev> SourPls CHEER UP CREW CUT
[0:53:59] <MemoryOfDust> @supaxmugen great
[0:54:00] <laguerrilha> Yeah lady singer was better

[0:54:09] <Frostydough1> Okay but that subhuman mix is a FUCKING banger
[0:54:12] <+thatfig> so when does the stream start
[0:54:17] <Mirakei> @chalkchug mostly growling tbh LUL
[0:54:20] <BalloniWright> CRIMSON CLOUD

[0:54:45] <chalkchug> @Mirakei Yea growling is either done really well or badly in my experience LUL
[0:54:51] <%ChoculaUltra> what if Woolie thinks he's been streaming this whole time
