[0:18:50] <@Menitta> Plates are in 7 but like 0, they do not matter
[0:18:50] <%Javaa01> Yeah the item box isn't shared yet, so they're probably just in Kiryu's item box
[0:18:51] <Mrchiselfist> @Prevot They changed a character for the Chinese release. Made 'em less monsterous.

[0:24:22] <ghoststalker> NEVER KILLED (yet)
[0:24:22] <TheNewJapanGuy> Majima isn't Kiryu
[0:24:22] <hazeprojekt> Majima has def killed people
[0:24:26] <X2Eliah> No but he's fine though
[0:24:28] <ÏΩîÏΩîÍæ∏Îùº> Chat, he's fine, look at him
[0:24:34] <For_Temeria> Heat moves get weaker when you repeat them on the same enemy

[0:24:55] <@Menitta> Oh he rips out the pole
[0:24:55] <andre11dr> The pose too LUL
[0:24:57] <thetrashman_sc> Also remember doing the same heat movein fights will weaken it
[0:25:00] <PsychoPearl> I don't think Majima's killed at this point, but probably future Majima has
[0:25:08] <hazeprojekt> heat moves get weaker the more you use them in a battle
[0:25:10] <@Menitta> Heat moves scale like crazy yeah
[0:25:11] <+EdenOfLove> oh wow this guy is so much harder on "hard", he almost always one shots you
[0:25:13] <mike0dude> what difficulty is woolie playing on
[0:25:13] <lucky_icarus> Doesnt batter have a move like that?
[0:25:17] <Blank9> Yeah, rotating weapons lets you go super fast.
[0:25:26] <+Shin_true92> was that a lady snowblood reference????
[0:25:32] <Josef_Stryker> You do less damage if u do the same heat action
[0:25:33] <@Solidus_113> It does WAY LESS damage every use @WoolieVersus
[0:25:34] <redrins> repeated heat moves do less damage
[0:25:37] <For_Temeria> Majima tries to beat two of his own subordinates to death in Yakuza 1
[0:25:46] <Halospaz117> Diminishing returns on the same heat moves guys
[0:25:49] <X2Eliah> That heat launch is a good "get out of anything free" card
[0:25:53] <+Zebylth> change weapons or you'll do less and less
[0:25:53] <LVL1_Scumbag> I think it's a bat
[0:25:54] <Ookamiden02> judging by the stab
[0:25:59] <+EdenOfLove> same heat move wont do good damage
[0:26:03] <OldManDeckardCain> it's obviously a gun Kappa
[0:26:05] <flame_of_udun_> Yeah the game punishes you for reusing the same heat moves
[0:26:09] <%Javaa01> Yeah I think it's in the blunt weapon category, same as bats without Slugger
[0:26:15] <+Tucker0603> heat moves have diminishing returns on damage for the same heat move
[0:26:17] <@Solidus_113> Heat moves get stale
[0:26:31] <Spagheddies> Heat moves get cold.
[0:26:35] <+EdenOfLove> Heat moves have diminishing returns if you use the same one
[0:26:36] <@Menitta> I love hearing the yell from Shakedown. ORRRRRRE
[0:26:38] <%aram909> heat moves go by devil may cry rules
[0:26:45] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> @WoolieVersus First time per battle does more damage, second onward does the same damage. (iow move variety is even more important here than in DMC)
[0:26:45] <mike0dude> Best weapon against mr shakedown is still the Shotguns
[0:26:47] <%aram909> useing the same one twice in a row reduces damage
[0:26:56] <+drinkmoxie> Thanks Woolie and V I‚Äôve been using an umbrella wrong for all my life
[0:27:17] <+EdenOfLove> Something something heat moves using the same one has bad damage
[0:27:22] <@Solidus_113> No damage
[0:27:29] <%aram909> woolie pull out the fucking bat
[0:27:30] <alvaroeltz> nothing damage
[0:27:30] <user_naim> @mike0dude When isn‚Äôt a shotgun good?
[0:27:31] <+EdenOfLove> literally no damage
[0:27:31] <X2Eliah> Almost no damage
[0:27:35] <saberdelkino> The pose does damage
[0:27:37] <zanzibarian_hamster> You're doing the same damage as like 2 punches with that shit
[0:27:41] <Crowmanhunter> Heat Moves get stronger each time you use it.
[0:27:41] <thetrashman_sc> heat operates differently from like every other gamr
[0:27:41] <resloxxx> never killed
[0:27:44] <%DatAsuna> Kiryu does have umbrella heat moves
[0:27:44] <+MayorRev> He's fine
[0:27:48] <amritadyne> diminishing returns on heat moves hit real quick
[0:27:48] <thetrashman_sc> @Crowmanhunter pls
[0:27:54] <For_Temeria> Heat move? Good damage. Heat move again? Bad
[0:27:56] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> I'm an anime watcher but I can at least watch woolie beat up shakedown-chan
[0:28:04] <+Stupid121v2> drop damage BIG
[0:28:05] <+EdenOfLove> Yes it does
[0:28:06] <Solidnick18> Yes
[0:28:06] <LVL1_Scumbag> yes
[0:28:07] <thetrashman_sc> yes
[0:28:07] <@Solidus_113> yes
[0:28:08] <redrins> it does
[0:28:08] <%aram909> use the bat
[0:28:08] <Halospaz117> YES
[0:28:08] <+EdenOfLove> it does
[0:28:08] <Mrchiselfist> maybe switch to slugger for the heat move?
[0:28:08] <TheNewJapanGuy> Yes I think so
[0:28:09] <Spagheddies> KEKW the pose deals damage
[0:28:09] <alvaroeltz> JUST USE THE BAT
[0:28:09] <Blank9> it would
[0:28:09] <Josef_Stryker> Yes
[0:28:10] <KnightAsteran> thats the same with every heat move
[0:28:10] <%MrKerb> yes
[0:28:10] <penitentpendant> Experiment!
[0:28:11] <inkthepeasant> BIG yes
[0:28:11] <%DatAsuna> Prepare to hear woolie learn that again next week
[0:28:11] <%CommanderSqueaks> yes
[0:28:11] <+Liquid_Dio> Yes
[0:28:12] <shorololo> it does
[0:28:13] <Halospaz117> IT SUPER FUCKING MATTERS
[0:28:14] <+Stupid121v2> YOu have to use different heat moves
[0:28:14] <%HollowedIdjit> !uptime

[0:28:14] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 39 minutes and 40 seconds
[0:28:15] <MyNameIsRasus> Yes it matters
[0:28:15] <flame_of_udun_> Yup
[0:28:16] <%aram909> bat does more damage
[0:28:17] <Prevot> variety woolz
[0:28:17] <+bearwagon> LUL rip
[0:28:20] <+Tucker0603> IT DOES, SWAP WEA
[0:28:21] <%CommanderSqueaks> big matters
[0:28:21] <Ookamiden02> different heat moves
[0:28:22] <+notsosober9> YES CHANGING IT HELPS
[0:28:22] <thetrashman_sc> V please
[0:28:24] <%DatAsuna> And then the week after he'll learn it again like it's new lol
[0:28:24] <Dhurkst> this guy is a fucking pincushion at this point
[0:28:27] <+EdenOfLove> Swap weapons to keep the same damage guys
[0:28:27] <flame_of_udun_> Absolutely it does V LUL
[0:28:28] <+Liquid_Dio> If it has a different animation, it's a different heat move @woolieversus
[0:28:28] <notsoy> if the actual heat move animation is different, then it has no penalty
[0:28:28] <alvaroeltz> ITS DMC RULES WOOLIE
[0:28:29] <X2Eliah> No, just mix them up
[0:28:31] <%Javaa01> Keep variety up to keep the damage up
[0:28:31] <inkthepeasant> it does like less than a normal attack if you use it multiple times lmfao
[0:28:32] <%wibbwobbler> switching helps
[0:28:33] <KnightAsteran> Repeating ANY heat move lowers the damage
[0:28:34] <mike0dude> I got my ass kicked so hard by shakedown early on then I found out it cost basically nothing to reload the shotgun at the shop so I just spam it now
[0:28:36] <X2Eliah> Don·∫ó repeatthe same
[0:28:36] <mike0dude> ez money
[0:28:38] <For_Temeria> Better not switch weapons for a different heat move
[0:28:40] <%Grimlockfly> swap weapons for dmage
[0:28:41] <Solidnick18> different weapons if you didn't use them have big damage
[0:28:42] <MyNameIsRasus> It's DMC style rules
[0:28:44] <siamzero94> damage goes up with style
[0:28:45] <%thesickestzak> woolieDATTEBAYO
[0:28:50] <%r0chelimit> nah man, as long as you're doing different heat moves the damage stays pretty good.
[0:28:50] <%aram909> slugger can block
[0:29:01] <+notsosober9> 1: Keep variety up to keep the damage up
[0:29:07] <+EdenOfLove> Heat moves have diminishing returns but using different weapons resets it
[0:29:10] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus each heat move has it's own damage scaling, the game wants you to do a bunch of different ones
[0:29:17] <@Solidus_113> spice of LIFE
[0:29:24] <%Grimlockfly> yeah, variety heat moves
[0:29:24] <Josef_Stryker> Isn't the nunchuk bat combo super good against Shakedown?
[0:29:24] <KnightAsteran> listen to Solidus, he smrt
[0:29:28] <For_Temeria> Mr. Shakedown has fun command grabs in case you're blocking
[0:29:30] <penitentpendant> Majima slices the air with his bat, two halves of the bullet hit the wall behind him
[0:29:31] <X2Eliah> NOW EAT THAT MONEY
[0:29:33] <%asdief_> baseball with guns
[0:29:37] <MyNameIsRasus> Solidus is a smart chatperson
[0:29:40] <+spardanwarrior> In the end Shakedown got shook down regardless
[0:29:40] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:29:40] <andre11dr> Just block the bullets with a bat ,it's easy
[0:29:43] <%aram909> swap between slugger heat moves and the umbrella heat moves and you'll be fine

[1:50:03] <+AngelYoumou> This is my second favorite style in the game~
[1:50:04] <lotharrio> I very rarely used Breaker.
[1:50:05] <dreamfillah> PARTY TABLE KICKU COUUURSE
[1:50:06] <PiGreat> hot take but breaker feels kinda bad to play

[1:50:13] <somedude1013> ESSENCE OF STUN LOCK
[1:50:13] <caramel_coffin> the most OP style
[1:50:13] <RyuuAoi> Chinese boxing!

[1:50:19] <%MechArch> ded
[1:50:20] <Josef_Stryker> Wait til u get the extra heat moves
[1:50:21] <gnarly_memes_bro> breaker is way too slow
[1:50:24] <exnuart> breaker is all about mobility
[1:50:33] <PsychoPearl> This style's good to use against groups
[1:50:44] <%Javaa01> And this is why people are perfectly fine with Majima getting into a fighting game over Kiryu
[1:50:46] <+chiazam> Breaker is fucking broken
[1:50:48] <gnarly_memes_bro> that first punch is too slow and thats all that matters to me
[1:50:56] <%Javaa01> Because Majima has some fuckin MOVES
[1:51:03] <Prevot> so he scams people, then?
[1:51:05] <@Squdnate> @PiGreat You're not alone. I love Breaker, it's fun. But I just don't like playing with it. For groups I use Slugger, cuz you can whipe them out in 3 moves
[1:51:08] <+Jaromero435> Break is RAD and that's all that matters to me
[1:51:10] <Pookiedaexzile> Calling Breaker slow LUL
[1:51:11] <RyuuAoi> The health clinic? You aight, Majima?
[1:51:15] <Monkeyweed21> time to kill this noble pimp
[1:51:23] <%wibbwobbler> thats a good victory line
[1:51:25] <Ookamiden02> Relationship with Slugger ended. Now Breaker is my best friend.
[1:51:33] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> @WoolieVersus Breaker is easy to use, but mastering the advanced stuff isn't for the weak-minded.
[1:51:38] <Dhurkst> @exnuart to me it's bad for mobility, due to long combos that require commitment
[1:51:39] <FunkyTK> @gnarly_memes_bro It is against Shakedown because it requires commitment, but you can kill an entire room fool of people in like a second, that more than makes up for it
[1:51:43] <@Solidus_113> I used breaker and slugger the most

[2:04:51] <+qwazzeon> @iswearimjustdandy A canadian video game stream of japanese themes? Yeah, that makes sense /s
[2:04:51] <majindusto> WHO?
[2:04:52] <Blank9> who here has heard of Spriggan: Lunar Verse by FromSoftware, japanese-only PSX licensed game, best Tomb Raider ever
[2:04:54] <andre11dr> I know what's the best, when your a foreigner in a country and people just assume you don't know the language and start shit talking, but i did understand
[2:04:54] <Kiryurules> One of my homeland's best bands
[2:04:57] <+AngelYoumou> Symphonic Metal?
[2:04:57] <%asdief_> cool barbed wire
[2:04:58] <oaktreesman> I got shit-talked in a few places in Japan for having tattoos and being a tall white person that speaks fluently, people accused me of selling drugs from the US and stuff lol
[2:05:02] <calebstanford9> Yeah that's a good descriptor I think
[2:05:07] <%solracc25> wooliePOYO
[2:05:09] <+mach0n4cho> but just how little is V?
[2:05:11] <oaktreesman> Twas wild
[2:05:17] <convo445> Brutal Legend is the most variaty i've ever got in metal
[2:05:23] <DaCheekyOne> Did they do any sidequests today?
[2:05:31] <X2Eliah> Oh yeah
[2:05:35] <Byr0nX> YOU
[2:05:36] <%p4ntless> if it wasn't recorded in a drain pipe on an old fisher price speak n' say, it's not kvlt
[2:05:38] <Pookiedaexzile> V aint little he Lil
[2:05:45] <$Holycow8498> SEGA
[2:05:46] <Solidnick18> YAHOO
[2:05:52] <Byr0nX> pink is speed
[2:05:54] <$Holycow8498> You have defeated Sega
[2:05:57] <Crowmanhunter> Breaker is also good 1 on 1
[2:05:58] <Byr0nX> yellow is heavy
[2:05:59] <Kiryurules> SPEEEEN
[2:06:02] <Byr0nX> blue is middle
[2:06:02] <Crowmanhunter> Honestly, breaker is just amazing
[2:06:04] <+mach0n4cho> but just how Lil is V?
[2:06:05] <@Solidus_113> Breaker heat is very specific
[2:06:08] <X2Eliah> Oh god Breaker is the "yahoo style"
[2:06:10] <PsychoPearl> You have to unlock them
[2:06:12] <+Tucker0603> pink is speed, yellow is HEAVY
[2:06:13] <%LittleWulfie> Doesn't have many heat moves early
[2:06:14] <brianthe12th> the heat moves for breaker are some of the best
[2:06:15] <exnuart> friendly fire is the best
[2:06:16] <%Javaa01> Breaker is light on heat moves, but the ones it does have are incredibly good
[2:06:18] <calebstanford9> YEEEEEYAHAAAA
[2:06:22] <Mattais88> Breaker heat moves are sick
[2:06:26] <Byr0nX> YO KNOW CAUSE OF THE PINK DRUGS
[2:06:26] <Dhurkst> Easy heat with this style would be BROKEN
[2:06:27] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> Breaker has no grab so most Heat Actions are out of the question.
[2:06:28] <$Holycow8498> Could you ever see Dante break dance fighting Woolie?
[2:06:33] <X2Eliah> Blue is the "boring" style
[2:06:34] <gnarly_memes_bro> bignumberdocombo dot png
[2:06:34] <sonofthedeepsouth> SQs
[2:06:34] <brunoberserk> and red is overpower/broken
[2:06:35] <+Liquid_Dio> Yellow = Power, Red = Speed, Blue = Balance
[2:06:36] <digitalslime> pink speed, yellow stronk
[2:06:38] <Solidnick18> or moves
[2:06:39] <Crowmanhunter> Breaker is OP cause unlike other styles, it can hit enemies on the ground.
[2:06:39] <sonofthedeepsouth> YAY
[2:06:41] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> @WoolieVersus Komeki and Areshi plz.

[2:53:31] <+GarudaPanzer> what Solidus said, change to diff heats
[2:53:33] <+QueequegTheater> @Liquid_Dio Ha ha no, he gets two more bars
[2:53:56] <+RiddleMeWhat> another Gamagoori class humanoid
[2:54:08] <majindusto> This is gonna be So Long of a Series lol
[2:54:14] <+BatGuano114> is this when he gets the instakill heat move, or does he have to get beat one more time for that to happen?
[2:54:38] <notsoy> switch to crowbar pls
[2:54:41] <Captain_sevatar> To be fair woolz health went up too
[2:54:49] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> Something the game explains rather poorly is how to setup enemies for that Air Spin Heat move. (either do the full combo down to the Freeze Pose, or nail the fully charged triangle)
[2:54:55] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus There is masive scaling on heat moves. Try using the bat heat move and hitting him on the ground
[2:55:30] <penitentpendant> Yup, rotate weapons
[2:55:32] <+Deko_> fatality
[2:55:35] <+QueequegTheater> Hit him on the ground
[2:55:39] <exnuart> thats literal death
[2:55:40] <Blank9> slime'em
[2:55:42] <penitentpendant> Crowbar, Bat, Umbrella, Knife, ROYAL GUARD
[2:55:43] <notsoy> tonfa actually get two different heat moves based on how much heat you have
[2:55:45] <diontmack> YOU STABBED HIM IN THE NECK WTF
[2:55:47] <%Javaa01> Guns don't have heat moves in this game
[2:55:49] <+Aldesso> NO
[2:55:49] <xeros720> can try picking up some stuff on the ground
[2:55:50] <+mechslayer71> You guys seen this shit going on in DC? Have they Talked about it?
[2:55:51] <%Javaa01> But slugger does
[2:55:55] <Byr0nX> they finally got one
[2:55:55] <exnuart> stabbed in the jaw
[2:55:58] <siamzero94> @BatGuano114 the grab? should be once he heats up
[2:55:58] <TheNewJapanGuy> *cough* Zap Gun *cough*
[2:56:04] <Crowmanhunter> Traffic coooone heat move
[2:56:08] <@Solidus_113> the zap gun he doesn't have?
[2:56:08] <%doomerskeletor13> He has one with a pistol I think
[2:56:15] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> Only game with gun heats (that I know of) is Kiwami 2 and (maybe) 6.
[2:56:20] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus NOW HIT HIM ON THE GROUND
[2:56:25] <Hammatime8> Ooooo, is that a box of nails over there?
[2:56:26] <LVL1_Scumbag> That's how you use heat moves
[2:56:31] <brianthe12th> Very nice to see you rotating weapons, use the items around you for more options
[2:56:33] <%Grimlockfly> you can also heat move with all the stuff on the ground there
[2:56:35] <Solidnick18> weapons around help to
[2:56:36] <%Javaa01> @doomerskeletor13 He has a pistol disarm move
[2:56:38] <%doomerskeletor13> @mechslayer71 It‚Äôs been brought up in chat but they‚Äôre not talking about for obvious reasons
[2:56:39] <+RiddleMeWhat> he's still not dumping those Bontan yens though
[2:56:42] <+QueequegTheater> No they're not, they're safer than you think
[2:56:42] <Haarute> Only Y ground hits
[2:56:43] <@Solidus_113> heat uup
[2:56:50] <smokey02> oooh. box of nails on the ground

[2:57:46] <+Kensei_cornutus> what species is mr shakedown
[2:57:46] <+Tucker0603> Grab items and use their heat moves
[2:57:59] <Blank9> alternating will keep the damage good I think
[2:57:59] <%Javaa01> Remember, all these clutter items on the ground have heat moves too
[2:58:15] <siamzero94> is it one hit kill on normal? or just on hard. got me good on my hard playthrough
[2:58:21] <+fluffyderdelphin> stance cannceling
