[0:02:24] <leith_aziz> In terms of meta, Nago is actually pretty good. You just gotta be good with him

[0:03:15] <%DaPurpleSharpie> nago is just too slow for me, and also i can't even see his bare feet woolieTRASH
[0:03:21] <GeoffGeofreed> Woolie put a ring on Nago already so he is maining him til the end of strive's life

[0:03:45] <leith_aziz> @Shishi1205 Chipp is really good, but him having low health and somewhat lackluster damage anmd bad air to airs keeps him at Top 5
[0:03:48] <%justmildlilac> The thing I've discovered about Nago is that as soon as you get in your opponent's head, it's a wrap. Feels so satisfying to shut down everything your opponent tries.
[0:03:49] <%jolene_orenji> @Shishi1205 anytime I play against chipp I know I'm either gonna instantly win or just have to put the controller down and watch my life go down depending on if I win neutral

[0:04:05] <+Shishi1205> @Shishi1205 Im sure pro players think he is top 4 easy
[0:04:08] <leith_aziz> Chipp is really good, but the low health really makes him risky. And unlike Akuma, he doesnt have the highest damage
[0:04:11] <CyrusVGZ> Nago isn't that hard to use. His difficulty is greatly exaggerated.
[0:04:20] <%jolene_orenji> @Jetfandam I feel like that's appropriate for chipp canon-wise too
[0:04:25] <%gkingsausagelink> nago does get in my head sometimes
[0:04:31] <leith_aziz> @CyrusVGZ Well, its mosty that Effing up with Nago is really easy
[0:04:43] <GeoffGeofreed> The hardest to use in my opinion are Zato and I-no
[0:04:47] <+Shishi1205> Poor anji, at least faust has some killers playing him
[0:04:57] <+Shishi1205> @GeoffGeofreed Zato by far yeah
[0:05:09] <%jolene_orenji> @Shishi1205 didn't a faust win a kinda big tournament recently?
[0:05:11] <+Jetfandam> I picked up Giovanna because I really like her design but I also like Ino at the moment
[0:05:15] <CyrusVGZ> I haven't played Guilty Gear since Bridget was in and I've won the majority of my matches using Nago in the beta.
[0:05:17] <%natedrago> @Shishi1205 kizzie was play anji a bit last week
[0:05:18] <leith_aziz> Nago is balanced by the fact that he has big normals and really good special moves
[0:05:22] <+Shishi1205> @Shishi1205 Hookgang yeah
[0:05:25] <lycandruid> is woolie the coward going to start the round with a special or is he more of a wakeup special kind of guy
[0:05:25] <GeoffGeofreed> Nage is a beast though
[0:05:32] <Belakitu> Soon the keyboard will be brought out, and we will write Shakespeare
[0:05:36] <leith_aziz> You cant use them much, but they DO their job well
[0:05:40] <DSD24> Ram is so cool
[0:05:40] <%justmildlilac> I picked up Axl as a secondary, feels real nice when you get in the zone and keep people away from ya
[0:06:02] <%justmildlilac> Also time stop supers are always hype
[0:06:05] <Asuterisuku> Can BSU be combo'd from RC?
[0:06:14] <%jolene_orenji> @justmildlilac I hate fighting axl so much. I feel like I know not to push buttons but my monkey brain takes over every time and I just get destroyed
[0:06:28] <BwdYeti> you pretty much never want blood in the middle, you want it high for big normals or low for combos
[0:06:36] <leith_aziz> @justmildlilac As a Sol, I have no idea how to get in. 2H just pushes me away from Axl
[0:06:45] <Asuterisuku> Axl either bullies or gets bullied based on the skill of the Axl.
[0:06:50] <+SuperUnhappyman> will we have mods?
[0:06:54] <Asuterisuku> There is no in-between.
[0:06:57] <leith_aziz> Axl is probably my worst matchup along with a good Millia, May or Nago
[0:07:16] <%justmildlilac> @jolene_orenji Oof, I feel that. Honestly I picked up Axl at first to see the other side of the match up. Turns out I found him real fun along the way
[0:07:19] <leith_aziz> Wait, Nago is fine. I-No could be harder
[0:07:20] <GeoffGeofreed> I've been maining Chipp but really want to learn Zato and I-no. Maybe even get Axl and Ky as well
[0:07:30] <%gkingsausagelink> I can't figure out how to get in and stay in against nago
[0:07:31] <leith_aziz> I main both Sol and Chipp
[0:07:44] <leith_aziz> @gkingsausagelink My tip is to bait 2H
[0:07:44] <+SuperUnhappyman> imagine doing things *plays pot*
[0:07:58] <%jolene_orenji> @justmildlilac he looks really fun but I'm afraid to pick up literally any other character than potemkin because I just wanna push buttons and be rewarded for it
[0:08:00] <%gkingsausagelink> @leith_aziz thank you
[0:08:01] <Club_Sodar> @Asuterisuku yep, you def can
[0:08:06] <leith_aziz> @SuperUnhappyman Grapplers dont get to complain (unless you're Android 16)
[0:08:10] <Jadorsonething> Hello FGC kindergarten teachers
[0:08:37] <%zirmandes> zirmandes subscribed with Prime. 
[0:08:37] <%justmildlilac> @leith_aziz You gotta mix up your approach options, as Axl can only control one zone of the screen at a time. Also try to practice your dash FDs until you can back them to the corner
[0:08:46] <leith_aziz> And to be fair, Potemkin is actually pretty good in this version in comparison to Rev 2 where he just sucked. He's pretty allright
[0:08:46] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:08:47] <user_naim> Just played 8 matches against a Nago. Dropped them to floor 7 and got myself to floor 9, all thanks to super cancer. That guy was really cool tho, and started beating me too.
[0:08:54] <%justmildlilac> When Axl is in the corner, he's kinda screwed
[0:08:54] <Dave_VD> @leith_aziz Kouma in melty blood is tragically weak for how god damn sick he is
[0:09:16] <%jolene_orenji> @SuperUnhappyman saw a video that said "Pot 2 combo to death" and it was just a guy playing against a chipp where he landed pot buster and then read the jump for HPB. potemkin is fun
[0:09:30] <%DatAsuna> menat's rad
[0:09:34] <leith_aziz> @justmildlilac Well ,my issue is that if I fail a mix, Axl always gets a combo that pushes me away
[0:09:35] <DSD24> Jack O and Menat are cute I wish I was good at playing them
[0:09:40] <GeoffGeofreed> When fight really good Potemkins I might as well be on 2 health when I use chipp
[0:09:40] <Doublemint_Dave_> Leo rules
[0:09:41] <Jadorsonething> Puppet characters are fun
[0:09:45] <%DatAsuna> stance characters I often gravitate too
[0:09:46] <%TooManyGs> TooManyGs subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! 
[0:09:52] <leith_aziz> I think I'd try Jack-O once she becomes DLC, but Asuka is my main priority
[0:09:53] <gunstars20> Ugh LUL
[0:09:59] <%gkingsausagelink> I wish I could do stances
[0:10:04] <%DatAsuna> My favourite Nioh weapon is odachi because it basically makes you a Stance character
[0:10:06] <+SuperUnhappyman> @SuperUnhappyman "now show the damage on someone other than chipp"
[0:10:08] <leith_aziz> I find Stancee with Leo easy
[0:10:16] <leith_aziz> He's probably the only STance character I can play
[0:10:17] <mrsandmando> Zato is a puppet character with stance switch canceling lmao.
[0:10:23] <%jolene_orenji> @leith_aziz I'm super curious as to how asuka will play and I hope he's just the saltiest zoner imaginable
[0:10:31] <Doublemint_Dave_> He still does have stance cancelling but yea, not too hard
[0:10:40] <DSD24> Odachi in Nioh 2 got some real cool moves
[0:10:52] <user_naim> @jolene_orenji yeah I’m excited
[0:10:55] <+SuperUnhappyman> but will woolie be using the woolie nago skin mod?
[0:11:00] <%DatAsuna> That's pretty good
[0:11:00] <Asuterisuku> I'd love to play but I have to work. gdqThump
[0:11:10] <leith_aziz> @leith_aziz I think Zoner. Guy's an expert in Magic. Something tells me Jack-O will play a bit different since she's no longer stuck in that half child personality
[0:11:14] <mrsandmando> I hope he’s fighting viewers today.

[0:12:03] <%jolene_orenji> Potemkin BUSTED
[0:12:06] <$Giothegame> So how many mods we got going on in Strive?
[0:12:08] <leith_aziz> Pot is ok
[0:12:19] <Doublemint_Dave_> I honestly enjoy fighting Potemkin more than other chars
[0:12:19] <@Solidus_113> I already have like a dozen mods
[0:12:19] <leith_aziz> He's not broken anymore, but he doesnt suck either
[0:12:24] <GeoffGeofreed> There are a lot of mods already

[0:12:36] <leith_aziz> I've installed a good amount of mods.
[0:12:39] <%TheotherKristian> I'm new but I found him super tough against my main Giovanna
[0:12:45] <%jolene_orenji> megafist is good
[0:12:46] <+fsp64> hi wollie, I have some dificult lanching Ky Fireball super (The Double foward motion ) on The PS4 analogic controll, any tips for a beginner?
[0:12:46] <leith_aziz> Really fun. Even the PS colors can be modded
[0:12:48] <NotHereToStream> hammerfall is easy to counter now
[0:12:52] <leith_aziz> Megafist is minus now
[0:12:55] <%gkingsausagelink> I can handle pot but I have to be clever
[0:12:58] <leith_aziz> It's still annoying
[0:13:00] <GeoffGeofreed> Potemkin can recover from a very bad start
[0:13:04] <+Shishi1205> Man seeing the video of Pots movements in the arcsys channel is a trip. Earth shaker doing dmg lmaooo
[0:13:06] <%jolene_orenji> @leith_aziz only megafist forward, back is plus
[0:13:07] <Asuterisuku> Megafist is punishable.
[0:13:09] <%Juriasu> yeah but now they are doing the next megafist lol
[0:13:17] <lvl10cybermancer> Everyone in the game has some dumb shit, Pot should be no exception
[0:13:21] <someyounguy1> THE FEAR
[0:13:32] <mrsandmando> Megafist hitbox so good you can’t 6P it because it hits you in your legs.
[0:13:33] <+hatefuldead666> sol can punish megafist on hit lmao
[0:13:34] <%jolene_orenji> grapplers make you stop playing strive and start playing their own game
[0:13:37] <+Shishi1205> Megafist is minus on hit
[0:13:58] <Dave_VD> @hatefuldead666 With what? 5k?
[0:13:58] <Afrosamasenpai> nah give me good hammerfall back
[0:14:00] <+Shishi1205> @jolene_orenji Thats Axl
[0:14:13] <leith_aziz> Maining Sol is so jarring. People either hate him or want him nerfed to shit. I admit he's broken, but the man is fun nontheless. The next moment I play Chipp against Sol and then I get salty too lol
[0:14:14] <%natedrago> @fsp64 try switching to d-pad, more accurate less drifting
[0:14:15] <%jolene_orenji> @Shishi1205 zoners do it too
[0:14:20] <BwdYeti> nago's big buttons are a problem for pot
[0:14:31] <lvl10cybermancer> @jolene_orenji So do zoners and rushdown though to be honest, in fact you get to play WAY more of your game against Pot than against someone like Chipp
[0:14:31] <+Shishi1205> Obstacle course time
[0:14:32] <leith_aziz> @hatefuldead666 huh? lol

[0:16:44] <leith_aziz> Well, command grab
[0:16:51] <GeoffGeofreed> I guess it's because zoners and grappler are considered "boring". Personally Im OK with any archetype
[0:16:52] <%jolene_orenji> @Equirah same lmao. I feel like all these millia and chipp mains are doin 600 hit combos on crack and I'm just like "they're not gonna expect a 4th megafist"
[0:16:55] <%gkingsausagelink> gio doesn't either
[0:16:56] <Heefnoff> Hold up you’re on PC today? Let’s gooooo

[0:17:51] <lvl10cybermancer> Also I don't even know if I'd say Axl is a true zoner because he can't really keep people locked out for more than a few hits
[0:17:59] <DSD24> Ooooo G Gundam hot takes
[0:18:04] <Equirah> @jolene_orenji straight up feels like we're playing at two different game speeds LUL
[0:18:07] <%ozzrabbit> Yeah, he wasted food and dumped it in my can
[0:18:09] <+fsp64> @theotherkristian me too brother, about 20 hours of strive already
[0:18:14] <leith_aziz> @lvl10cybermancer A character who plays keep away is a zoner
[0:18:15] <DSD24> Zebra Gundam
[0:18:18] <Zerud> @Wool a bug is a non intended action in the program, that can or not crash it, a glitch is a bug that a person can manipulate

[0:18:55] <Prevot> what the fuck
[0:18:56] <redhotdivekick> that clip haunts me
[0:18:56] <Vyneci> HE DID
[0:18:58] <DSD24> @jolene_orenji Look up Tequila Gundam
[0:18:58] <lvl10cybermancer> @lvl10cybermancer He CAN play keep away but it's not his gameplan to do it for the whole match, because against anyone but Pot it's just not possible unless you're INSANELY more skilled than your opponent
[0:18:58] <%DaPurpleSharpie> Lul
[0:18:59] <+Shishi1205> And almost choked
[0:18:59] <Halospaz117> Blame the swedes
[0:19:00] <KogaNoidZX> He DEFINITELY did
[0:19:06] <%natedrago> 100% why he felt like shit
[0:19:09] <Daxalog> Joel force fed dog food into Patt's mouth
[0:19:10] <%eanscrale> how did it taste?
[0:19:11] <leith_aziz> isnt that the same?
[0:19:15] <Asuterisuku> Words.
[0:19:18] <mrsandmando> God I watched that video last night. Hate it.
[0:19:19] <%jolene_orenji> @DSD24 oh my god
[0:19:26] <+HunnyBearz> PC Tonight? Lets gooo.
[0:19:29] <OldManDeckardCain> remember kids, pat will do ANYTHING for 100 bucks LUL
[0:19:37] <leith_aziz> You considered any mods Woolie?
[0:19:38] <sandwichpeddler> Vinesauce Joel dared Pat to eat dog treats for $100 and Pat said “fuck it” and just did it
[0:19:43] <%impressionistcowboy> Hey longtime listener and first time guilty gear player, been playing nothing but dwarf fortress and crusader kings for like 5 years so I am poopoo garbage but loving floor 4 and I-No lol.
[0:19:48] <leith_aziz> I think I'd like 3 rounds personally. Not sets
[0:20:04] <+Shishi1205> BO5 is better for skill
[0:20:10] <gunstars20> Never forget 2/3 BBTAG Evo
[0:20:13] <+slaughterpuff> floor 4 is a good starting place
[0:20:13] <+fsp64> @natedrago you think is easier with the dpad? I never thought about, going to give a try in training mode
[0:20:16] <Dave_VD> That video of Pat buying dozens of loot boxes while Kira's theme plays in the background seems relevant
[0:20:20] <Diego_Umejuarez> heres ur ino tip go watch the 15v15 that ended couple hours ago
[0:20:22] <%TheotherKristian> RUSH
[0:20:26] <DSD24> Always go in
[0:20:28] <%DkLordG> @impressionistcowboy floor 4 bois let's goooooo
[0:20:31] <%DatAsuna> wax on wax off
[0:20:32] <%Helix_Snake> Helix_Snake subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! I just made it to floor 9 after switching to using the Keyboard. I also play I-NO. Keyboard is amazing compared to a controller, I'll never fail to do a super again
[0:20:33] <NotHereToStream> 2D-projectile, go nuts
[0:20:34] <mrsandmando> I wonder what floor 1 looks like lmao.
[0:20:34] <%cobalt_phoenix_> thanks
[0:20:36] <leith_aziz> I-no''s 2nd super is a command grab
[0:20:37] <+thefancywig> types playing AS ino or AGAINST ino?
[0:20:38] <+Shishi1205> Do megalomania for 50%
[0:20:39] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> good tip
[0:20:40] <Asuterisuku> STBT is a good tip.
[0:20:40] <%DatAsuna> thanks reggie

[0:20:42] <%jolene_orenji> YOU'RE MY BOTTOM BITCH
[0:20:42] <%impressionistcowboy> STROKE IT BOIS
[0:20:45] <+PositivelyNick> excellent tip imp
[0:20:46] <+OroOreo> stroke the big tree into rc and grab for FREE DAMAGE
[0:20:47] <leith_aziz> H version is plus
[0:20:48] <+PositivelyNick> *imo
[0:20:59] <%natedrago> @fsp64 yeah, I had the same issue with dbfz. Switched to the dpad, made the supers come out easier
[0:20:59] <%impressionistcowboy> FLOOR FOUR BOIS LOVE STROKING IT
[0:21:08] <NotHereToStream> the last time she stroked the big tree she got evaporated Kappa
[0:21:12] <%Helix_Snake> people can grab the heavy version of stroke the big tree, watch out for that on higher floors
[0:21:16] <kojanga> 2nd fighting game, any advice on zato
[0:21:18] <Daxalog> Are the bottom 3 floors even real?
[0:21:21] <FrostedZaibatsu> Stroke is good in neutral, never in a block string
[0:21:22] <%Shad0wTag> Shad0wTag is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to WoolieVersus's community! They've gifted a total of 3 in the channel! 
[0:21:23] <%Shad0wTag> Shad0wTag gifted a Tier 1 sub to Halospaz117! 
[0:21:28] <%DatAsuna> Siege you absolutely need to learn how to learn first
[0:21:30] <Asuterisuku> I started on Floor 2. I didn't stay there long.
[0:21:33] <%Halospaz117> Oh rad, thanks
[0:21:35] <Daxalog> Oh
[0:21:36] <%DatAsuna> Aim is actually not that big a deal in Siege tho
[0:21:38] <leith_aziz> @kojanga Once Eddie runs out, use flight while waiting for Eddie to come back
[0:21:38] <OldManDeckardCain> 18 fully clothed cowboys using stroking the big tree to get in
[0:21:45] <leith_aziz> Zato players do this all thee time
[0:21:49] <%DatAsuna> It's all about learning utility and maps.
[0:21:53] <kojanga> @kojanga k
[0:22:05] <mrsandmando> @kojanga Start with BNB videos and take the knowledge you learn from there to branch off into deeper tech.
[0:22:06] <%DatAsuna> So before practicing your aim, you learn how to learn a room.
[0:22:06] <BwdYeti> it also makes the load times shorter, which is nice
[0:22:15] <3Xgilly> WORD?!
[0:22:18] <%X2Eliah> when you thought you were gonna play a game, and find out you have to study and take exams
[0:22:21] <3Xgilly> ill start doing that
[0:22:22] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh thats cool thanks!
[0:22:23] <Heefnoff> I always set my training mode character to the last opponent that beat my ass lol
[0:22:24] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> I couldn't find that shit on pc for some reason, IS it on pc even?
[0:22:26] <%natedrago> kizzie2Word
[0:22:28] <%Shad0wTag> Yo Woolie! Thank you fot everything over the years! You got me reinvigorated to get back into playing competitively again in FG's with Strive!
[0:22:30] <Heefnoff> Even if I don't learn anything, it's cathartic
[0:22:34] <leith_aziz> I really want to use quick match more often. Issue is that it just puts you in a random lobby and you dont get to fight with as many people as just going to the lobby
[0:22:35] <%Juriasu> yeah it is on pc
[0:22:37] <RealDurdyDan> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ Yeah
[0:22:47] <Dave_VD> @kojanga @kojanga the super where he fires the big sword will refill your Eddie life gauge, and place him near the opponent
[0:22:49] <leith_aziz> If quick match just worked like normal quick match, I'd use it
[0:22:52] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> dam, guess I gotta look harder
[0:22:52] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1407590785118257154?s=20
[0:22:52] <+Hollow_Mirage> Gnawledge
[0:22:56] <%natedrago> $$$ tho
[0:22:57] <%Th3rd3> I really hope the dummy can mimic what happen from the previous match
[0:23:00] <Heefnoff> If you like keyboard, go for a Mixbox
[0:23:04] <+yukichocomilk> playing in parks also helps because you can infinite rematch
[0:23:07] <ElPlasa> mixbox more specifically
[0:23:10] <%eanscrale> Depends if you're using W or Space for up.
[0:23:11] <Doublemint_Dave_> My local has THREE keyboard users, its a nightmare running a tourney on PC...
[0:23:14] <%jolene_orenji> I've even seen hitboxes with actual WASD keys instead of buttons or a stick
[0:23:15] <lvl10cybermancer> I don't get why everyone memes about keyboard being unplayable when it's literally a hitbox
[0:23:17] <bonebagMEL> Keyboard plays just like a hitbox, I play GG on a keyboard with red switches and it's pretty snappy. Not great for complicated motion imputs tho
[0:23:18] <FloatYourGoat> luv ur vids helix
[0:23:18] <VJdarkworld> @leith_aziz im curious how it works, i think it does eventually move u to another lobby
[0:23:33] <Asuterisuku> This game does NOT like switching primary audio devices.
[0:23:37] <%jolene_orenji> @Doublemint_Dave_ lmao can you even attach two keyboards to a computer
[0:23:47] <benderb0t> east coast lobby usually yea?
[0:23:56] <%Shad0wTag> @jolene_orenji yes you can I use two for my job
[0:24:07] <%ToadKing> @jolene_orenji yes, but i guess most games just treat it as one
[0:24:07] <leith_aziz> I remember there being a weird moment where music got cut off in a match and it wouldnt come back till the next round
[0:24:10] <%Shad0wTag> @benderb0t It's where he was last weekend
[0:24:11] <Doublemint_Dave_> @jolene_orenji yea, there's some work arounds
[0:24:11] <Equirah> @WoolieVersus are EU players welcomed
[0:24:15] <%jolene_orenji> @Shad0wTag crazy cirISee
[0:24:19] <leith_aziz> Can anybody jump in?
[0:24:19] <%slayabee> Are we running any mods today?
[0:24:22] <leith_aziz> I'd love to play
[0:24:24] <+BusterRepukken> I have a Cross Up.
[0:24:29] <+MTLxSpider> sound setting
[0:24:36] <VJdarkworld> monkaS
[0:24:36] <+Shishi1205> lmao
[0:24:37] <Lilguyfinish> wack
[0:24:38] <%natedrago> LUL LUL
[0:24:38] <%Shad0wTag> @equirah Yeah dude! I played last week and I'm in the UK
[0:24:39] <he1lhydra> dammit reggie
[0:24:39] <%Irridium> lol
[0:24:42] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> YEYEYE STICC PREVAILS AGAIN
[0:24:45] <bonebagMEL> Disable de stick in the sound settings
[0:24:45] <leith_aziz> Sometimes that happens with my PC
[0:24:46] <KogaNoidZX> Oh it's a Quanba? Yeah mine does that too, sometimes it even mutes my tv lmao
[0:24:46] <Asuterisuku> The Drone does not do this.
[0:24:47] <+MTLxSpider> there u go
[0:24:48] <%jolene_orenji> @leith_aziz I've had it before where I get a hit that would end the round that gets rolled back so it stops playing music but the match keeps going
[0:24:49] <@Solidus_113> I have the same problem with PS4 pads in general
[0:24:49] <leith_aziz> annoying
[0:24:50] <kapitankolin> ps5 controller does that on my PC too lol
[0:24:51] <%impressionistcowboy> oh there's some sounds
[0:24:52] <+BusterRepukken> Cross Up is very useful for Tekken and it saves my wrists.
[0:24:55] <%Th3SmartAlec> Cursed noise LUL
[0:24:59] <%Juriasu> we hear the game
[0:25:02] <FrostedZaibatsu> I think PS4 controllers do that. Takes over my mic and speakers sometimes
[0:25:05] <+Arnschen> Oh yeah, it does that to PC. It's so weird
[0:25:08] <Asuterisuku> A little low.
[0:25:10] <+Arnschen> Happens with my controller
[0:25:11] <%ToadKing> a tad low
[0:25:13] <%Shadow_Yomi> my victrix does the same thing
[0:25:13] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> it could be louder
[0:25:14] <%Juriasu> sound level is perfect for me
[0:25:16] <leith_aziz> a bit low
[0:25:18] <NotHereToStream> uh when people play on pads, do you use the pad or the joystick? I can't for the life of me use the d pad
[0:25:18] <%natedrago> higher please
[0:25:19] <%Shad0wTag> @jolene_orenji Its mostly cuz of the function keys I need them to do older stuff with MSDOS and not change my brightness or volume
[0:25:22] <ullyzeez> has woolie switched to stick?
[0:25:31] <%natedrago> yes
[0:25:31] <leith_aziz> @NotHereToStream I use the pad personally
[0:25:31] <Asuterisuku> Better.
[0:25:44] <%itsmostlynick> @NotHereToStream I use the pad. I tried to use the stick and I just fumble my life away.
[0:25:48] <+BusterRepukken> I have to use a pad for Strive though cause PS5s aren't compatible with certain sticks.
[0:25:53] <%Wool> any mods?
[0:25:54] <Doublemint_Dave_> PAD PogChamp
[0:25:57] <+yukichocomilk> @NotHereToStream I use the analog but it's like a weirdo thing apparently
[0:26:02] <+OroOreo> same
[0:26:05] <Asuterisuku> What kind of controller?
[0:26:06] <leith_aziz> I wonder what the story DLC will be baout? I hope it covers Faust
[0:26:13] <NotHereToStream> @leith_aziz @itsmostlynick DS4 or DS5?
[0:26:15] <%jolene_orenji> @NotHereToStream I use the pad because it's a bit more consistent
[0:26:17] <leith_aziz> *about
[0:26:24] <%Shad0wTag> @busterrepukken Yeah the legacy stick issues are cropping up already
[0:26:27] <Doublemint_Dave_> PAD RULES PogChamp
[0:26:29] <+Hollow_Mirage> I hope the story DLC will cover the many characters not present in the story
[0:26:34] <+yukichocomilk> the analog can be consistent if you just practice
[0:26:34] <Equirah> i can't do diagonals 100% of the time on the DS4 dpad
[0:26:35] <leith_aziz> @NotHereToStream DS4. I actually hear the DS5 is bad for foghting games
[0:26:37] <%itsmostlynick> @NotHereToStream DS 5.
[0:26:38] <%Irridium> @NotHereToStream I used to always use the stick but with strive I've forced myself to learn the pad. Works great except with the PS5 d-pad if you press hard say left sometimes it registers as an up or down input for me
[0:26:42] <+BusterRepukken> @Shad0wTag thanks Sony
[0:26:45] <+SuperUnhappyman> @Hollow_Mirage you mean faust and may?
[0:26:46] <%Shad0wTag> @yukichocomilk Me too dude. I find it easier to QCF and QCB really easy
[0:26:53] <+yukichocomilk> yup!
[0:26:53] <%Juriasu> as long as itäs not on 4k you should be fine
[0:26:56] <%Th3SmartAlec> but where's the Steamed Hams mod?
[0:26:57] <ullyzeez> a furry hat gives you 5 ms of reaction time
[0:26:59] <jellymang> MR. HEART
[0:26:59] <leith_aziz> @Hollow_Mirage I only know Faust, Ram and May not appearing
[0:27:03] <Diego_Umejuarez> yall are such weebs watching intros every time lmfao
[0:27:03] <%ToadKing> the game runs pretty well on PC as long as you don't go above 1080p
[0:27:04] <NotHereToStream> alrighty thanks for the inputs
[0:27:05] <Asuterisuku> A lot of that is developers being more reasonable about inputs lately.
[0:27:09] <%jolene_orenji> @leith_aziz I wish they'd give us like bayonetta cutscene/visual novel style extra episodes following the characters from Xrd that got left out in strive. Would love to see the Raven bakery
[0:27:12] <%ToadKing> BOO
[0:27:14] <Asuterisuku> Nothing as stupid as a Pretzel.
[0:27:14] <leith_aziz> I installed a Woolie modf
[0:27:15] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[0:27:16] <+yukichocomilk> the mods are sick
[0:27:17] <leith_aziz> *mod
[0:27:17] <Equirah> takes 3 mins
[0:27:21] <@Solidus_113> mods are a quick 2 minute process
[0:27:21] <+FuqBoiSlim> No taco bell counter mod?!
[0:27:22] <leith_aziz> Mods in this gamne are sick
[0:27:23] <%Wool> mods are very simple to install, just drag and drop
[0:27:25] <NotHereToStream> there was a blade mode for nago
[0:27:26] <Equirah> you just make a folder
[0:27:27] <leith_aziz> Also very easy
[0:27:29] <NotHereToStream> mod*
[0:27:32] <%Shad0wTag> @busterrepukken Not to be an xbox shill but glad that doesn't happen to me on there
[0:27:33] <@Solidus_113> I could send you a folder of basic fun stuff if you want
[0:27:36] <WakeUpThrow> Woolie's color scheme IS pretty rad, tbf
[0:27:38] <+Arnschen> Aww
[0:27:43] <%DkLordG> Woolie gets himself into fighting games
[0:27:46] <NotHereToStream> send him the totsugeki mod
[0:27:46] <%natedrago> i blinked and it was over
[0:27:49] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @fuqboislim omg that sounds amazing
[0:27:50] <leith_aziz> @jolene_orenji You mean the Venom bakery?
[0:27:54] <%Shad0wTag> @asuterisuku Watch KOF 15 have more pretzels than ever
[0:28:00] <+Calltire3> damn that combo
[0:28:02] <+SuperUnhappyman> LETS GOOO MAC TONITE MODE
[0:28:04] <+BusterRepukken> @Shad0wTag yeah Sony clearly wants people buying more licensed sticks. The PS5 is completely incompatible with Brooks boards sticks.
[0:28:04] <leith_aziz> Hell, I'd love an episode just for Wroldbuilding
[0:28:08] <Asuterisuku> Nago's damage is high and Millia's health is low, of course rounds are going to be fast.
[0:28:12] <%jolene_orenji> @leith_aziz oop yeah that one. I forget some of the characters not in strive since I didn't play xrd LUL
[0:28:39] <leith_aziz> @jolene_orenji That's fine. Actually in an interview I think it was mentioned they aint bringing Venom back?
[0:28:44] <%itsmostlynick> I had to get pretty okay at air-grabbing Millia otherwise I'd have no chance.
[0:28:44] <+Patch_TheSquid> @BusterRepukken you're being dramatic, brooks is working on a mod.
[0:28:46] <ExplosionForce> Have you tried out the taunt RC tech, or the new wake up super RC for an invul wake up for only 50 meter? @woolieversus
[0:28:56] <KogaNoidZX> Venom's a baker now so I doubt he's coming back
[0:28:57] <%Shad0wTag> @busterrepukken I can see the Sony branded being sticks sold at Sony branded Evo now
[0:29:02] <leith_aziz> Does chat know there's a Woolie mod for Nago lol
[0:29:02] <+BusterRepukken> @Patch_TheSquid what mod? and how am I being dramatic when its true
[0:29:06] <+SuperUnhappyman> lets goo reggie
[0:29:09] <Paralurx> what up Woolz, hope the back is finally done giving you problems homie
[0:29:13] <Asuterisuku> Yes chat knows.
[0:29:13] <%jolene_orenji> @leith_aziz aww rip :( I kinda wanted venom w/ a robo ky floating head puppet but it makes sense he won't fight again
[0:29:14] <+OroOreo> reggies chun li with that c.k into super
[0:29:18] <Daniel_Is_I> Reggie fears the Totsugeki
[0:29:21] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> may changes people
[0:29:26] <VJdarkworld> may mindbroke reggie?
[0:29:29] <+shoryukenabotch> r0maNoDolphin r0maNoDolphin r0maNoDolphin r0maNoDolphin r0maNoDolphin
[0:29:31] <%Shad0wTag> @leith_aziz Yup he's out along with Robo Ky
[0:29:38] <leith_aziz> @jolene_orenji I cant guarantee 100% as im not sure about that article. I wouldnt mind him coming back
[0:29:40] <%natedrago> kizzie2Totsugeki kizzie2Totsugeki kizzie2Totsugeki
[0:29:45] <+slaughterpuff> Everyone should fear the totsugeki
[0:29:46] <Moldy_Giraffe> C O U N T E R
[0:29:52] <BwdYeti> With Millia you should be getting straight above them and falling on them until they prove they can get out of that

[0:29:56] <%jolene_orenji> @jolene_orenji all I can do is pray 🙏
[0:29:57] <Asuterisuku> Counte-Counter C O U N T-Counter
[0:30:05] <leith_aziz> I mean, Venom can comeback, they just need to rework him into a more goofy playstyle
[0:30:08] <NotHereToStream> Bruh mod that replaces the COUNTER
[0:30:19] <%DatAsuna> F
[0:30:23] <%jolene_orenji> @NotHereToStream saw one that replaced the counter with the taco bell bong noise
[0:30:27] <leith_aziz> There's a Counter mod that replaces it with Joseph's OHH NOOO!
[0:30:30] <leith_aziz> Hilarious
[0:30:33] <+BruceyG> I prefer the Vine Boom replacing the counter hit noise
[0:30:37] <NotHereToStream> @jolene_orenji yooo
[0:30:38] <%natedrago> lmao that sounds amazing
[0:30:40] <%Juriasu> Millias fastest button is 6 frames lol
[0:30:43] <+Patch_TheSquid> @BusterRepukken it's not true tho. you are acting like this is an intentional attack on smaller brands, but it's not. and the mod im refering to is the update to there universal boards, theres also a software update you could download that fixxed it for some games.
[0:30:51] <%DatAsuna> @leith_aziz I can imagine that being the best then immediately becoming the worst
[0:30:52] <%natedrago> need a "son of bisss" when you lose
[0:30:54] <Asuterisuku> Weird, it looks like the visuals are tearing a bit.
[0:30:55] <leith_aziz> I should have gotten that Joseph mod lmao
[0:30:55] <%Irridium> get that potemkin reverb fart mod
[0:30:57] <+Gamegenie222> tatsu is only plus at farther ranges
[0:31:06] <dumpster_garbage> did anyone notice when they matched up, if they are VIP yet?
[0:31:16] <%impressionistcowboy> ah man that nagoriyuki blood shit is so brutal
[0:31:17] <%Shad0wTag> Millia schmix is still the most annoying thing to deal with as someone with no invincible wake up outside of their super - Potemkin main
[0:31:18] <leith_aziz> @dumpster_garbage They're playing offline
[0:31:20] <+BusterRepukken> @Patch_TheSquid wheres this software update
[0:31:29] <%jolene_orenji> @Irridium didn't get that but I did download the Gangster's Paradise and Pogtemkin mods for Heavenly Potemkin Buster
[0:31:31] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Davos_Southway
[0:31:32] <dumpster_garbage> lol forgot
[0:31:48] <leith_aziz> @Shad0wTag You have an aegis super. You dont need meterless reversal as well
[0:31:51] <%justmildlilac> A favorite mod I know of plays the choir part of Gangster's Paradise when you land a HPB
[0:31:55] <%jolene_orenji> @Davos_Southway they're playing against eachother rn but they'll say in a bit
[0:31:55] <%natedrago> moobot got that sniper
[0:32:02] <leith_aziz> I got 2 Dante skins for Ky
[0:32:05] <+BruceyG> HPB with fart reverb tho
[0:32:06] <leith_aziz> They look great
[0:32:14] <%Shad0wTag> @dumpster_garbage Ranks reset this month I believe
[0:32:17] <ElPlasa> @Shad0wTag tell that to Leo then
[0:32:21] <+BusterRepukken> since Dante didnt make it into Smash, maybe he could make it into Guilty Gear
[0:32:26] <leith_aziz> ^
[0:32:27] <Lilguyfinish> blood rage hitting woolie hard
[0:32:30] <+Davos_Southway> @jolene_orenji thanks for the heads up thought I missed my chance. :D
[0:32:31] <leith_aziz> I still want Dante in Strive
[0:32:32] <%jolene_orenji> @Shad0wTag I think they've already reset, at least for celestial players
[0:32:36] <leith_aziz> That hasnt changed
[0:32:46] <%natedrago> He would fit, I really hope there's a guest character
[0:32:59] <%Shad0wTag> @leith_aziz If May mains can be unreasonable with their complaints then so can I
[0:33:09] <+BusterRepukken> think about wife kill wife regret
[0:33:10] <leith_aziz> @natedrago They mentioned not having DLC characters till the stroy is done. Maybe now's the perfect time?
[0:33:19] <FrostedZaibatsu> Can you not grab after his blood burst? i tried yesterday and whiffed
[0:33:22] <dumpster_garbage> may needs buffs, specifically fast dolphin
[0:33:23] <leith_aziz> @BusterRepukken Nah. Save wife, life good
[0:33:25] <%natedrago> Tho Lore wise, his guns may be an issue lol
[0:33:33] <+Calltire3> @BusterRepukken Damn it, now I really want that and I know it's probably not going to happen pogonaSad
[0:33:34] <%justmildlilac> Their are May players complaining? LMAOOOOOO
[0:33:35] <%Shad0wTag> @elplasa Leo has like a great flash kick as a reversal?
[0:33:43] <%justmildlilac> *there
[0:33:51] <+BusterRepukken> who saying "Buff May"
[0:33:53] <leith_aziz> @natedrago It can just be magic guns the same way Elphelt does it. Or just Pull Dante from a different dimension
[0:33:54] <+BusterRepukken> show yourselves
[0:33:56] <BwdYeti> Woolie keeps going over on blood >:
[0:33:57] <%Juriasu> run up burst???
[0:33:57] <Asuterisuku> Called OUT.
[0:33:58] <VJdarkworld> SLASH!
[0:33:59] <KogaNoidZX> LUL
[0:33:59] <Daniel_Is_I> "I know" famous last words
[0:34:00] <%Shad0wTag> @jolene_orenji Yeah I'm sure as Max had to get back to VIP
[0:34:00] <+OroOreo> the gold
[0:34:03] <codymagpie> lol
[0:34:06] <dumpster_garbage> buff may, nerf faust
[0:34:09] <+Shishi1205> thats a rad mod costume
[0:34:09] <leith_aziz> May buffed? oh dear lord, chat...
[0:34:17] <%jolene_orenji> @BusterRepukken consider: buff may, but like body type wise and not gameplay wise. give may abs
[0:34:18] <ElPlasa> @Shad0wTag he has his flash kick and a reversal super
[0:34:20] <OkamiDude15> buff may and make heavy dolphin guard crush like fafnir Kappa
[0:34:23] <watchdv> Everyones saying buff may, make her p 3f
[0:34:37] <%jolene_orenji> make the dolphins a command grab, fuck it
[0:34:45] <Asuterisuku> @natedrago Dante's guns are already magic.
[0:34:48] <leith_aziz> Really, Faust needs some buffs, especially his super
[0:34:50] <%Shad0wTag> @justmildlilac They think Dolphin in neutral is fine and we just need to better from some twitter threads I saw
[0:34:50] <+Shishi1205> May already has a command grab
[0:34:51] <+BusterRepukken> buff Sol as well, why not
[0:34:56] <%natedrago> ah okay
[0:34:57] <+CatsEyeBlind> Give the dolphin abs
[0:34:57] <leith_aziz> @natedrago Then it's perfect
[0:34:59] <+BusterRepukken> Hit a button, instant 6 hit combo
[0:35:00] <Equirah> sol's bandit needs more recovery frames on a whiff
[0:35:02] <watchdv> Have her dolphin be a raging demon
[0:35:05] <BwdYeti> you really need to jump
[0:35:14] <leith_aziz> @BusterRepukken Remember Johnny? That aint as far fetched as you think
[0:35:15] <+Patch_TheSquid> @BusterRepukken i stand corrected, they are just telling people if they want to use brook to play the ps4 version on your ps5. but they are working on the firmware update currently. as well as working with JFA for a new board for the micro.
[0:35:19] <+Purple_Shirt> hype to see some millia
[0:35:23] <Dave_VD> yooo nice Reggie
[0:35:25] <%Shad0wTag> @elplasa So you're agreeing with me?
[0:35:29] <gyrobasel> reggie kinda nutty on millia
[0:35:32] <leith_aziz> Nice
[0:35:40] <%Shad0wTag> @jolene_orenji She has a command grab already aaaaa
[0:35:42] <+RiceeFTW> woolie with the cali burst PogChamp
[0:35:43] <%impressionistcowboy> god that was gross, well done reggie
[0:35:44] <%illtima> Reggie jumped
[0:35:47] <%jolene_orenji> woolie writing into his phone notes "Milia: DON'T GET HIT"
[0:35:48] <%gitgouda> gitgouda subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[0:35:48] <Asuterisuku> Dropped the super still got the round.
[0:35:49] <gtiblaziken> Let's go, Regginald!!
[0:36:03] <OldManDeckardCain> oh no, reggie is gonna break woolie's bakc again NotLikeThis
[0:36:09] <+Azhaaar> !uptime
[0:36:09] <@Moobot> @Azhaaar WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 50 minutes and 4 seconds
[0:36:12] <+BusterRepukken> @Patch_TheSquid so this new stick I have is fucked essentially, Cool.
[0:36:13] <gyrobasel> buck breaking
[0:36:14] <%Buttface_> Buttface_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months! 
[0:36:18] <leith_aziz> We got the next DLC character coming this month. It'll probably be Gollewis since he's new. Though I'd like Asuka first
[0:36:20] <ElPlasa> @Shad0wTag I don't even remember what the original statemen was lol
[0:36:27] <leith_aziz> *Goldlewis.
[0:36:41] <NotHereToStream> I'd think happy chaos might be dlc 1
[0:36:42] <%justmildlilac> Could also be Happy Chaos
[0:36:44] <+Patch_TheSquid> @BusterRepukken what stick do you have? you could literally just play the ps4 version on your ps5 and be fine.
[0:36:46] <Dave_VD> Yo was that a tiger knee? PogChamp
[0:36:46] <leith_aziz> Reggie got the combos. Nice
[0:37:00] <Asuterisuku> It has to be That Man, That Man, or Burger Secretary.
[0:37:00] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:37:04] <+SeventhVice> FREE
[0:37:06] <%Shad0wTag> @leith_aziz They mentioned July's DLC character is new and the rest are all returning
[0:37:08] <ElPlasa> @justmildlilac I'd love to see Happy Chaos as a fighter
[0:37:09] <%jolene_orenji> was That Man playable in any of the previous guilty gears?
[0:37:12] <%natedrago> good hit confrim
[0:37:14] <KogaNoidZX> Nah he wasn't
[0:37:15] <+BusterRepukken> @Patch_TheSquid Cross Up and no, the PS4 version is ass. it looks worse and it loads very slowly. PS4 version also has way more input delay.
[0:37:16] <%Buttface_> someone looked at all the models and goldlewis by far has the most detailed model of everyone from story mode
[0:37:17] <leith_aziz> I wonder if Happy CHaos will just get Crawl as his theme. Either that or he gets a new theme as well like I-No did in XX
[0:37:18] <%Shad0wTag> @elplasa We good bud, don't worry
[0:37:19] <gyrobasel> did they confirm that there is only going to be 1 version of strive or will it have expansions like rev1 and 2?
[0:37:23] <%natedrago> @jolene_orenji he was a boss in 2
[0:37:25] <%Buttface_> so he looks to be the most likely
[0:37:26] <+Azhaaar> Nice confirm Regi
[0:37:29] <leith_aziz> There was a Boss I-No theme and a normal I-No theme
[0:37:32] <%jolene_orenji> @natedrago cool cirISee
[0:37:32] <+Calltire3> @leith_aziz I want him too but I think there's a better chance of Asuka or Happy Chaos getting in first, with them having large roles in the story and all
[0:37:42] <%impressionistcowboy> god can't wait to play secretary of burgs
[0:37:43] <Equirah> @gyrobasel has season passes so likely only 1
[0:37:44] <%justmildlilac> @gyrobasel The game just came out, chill
[0:37:54] <leith_aziz> @gyrobasel I think its going to have seasons only this time, which will make things less confusing
[0:37:55] <lvl10cybermancer> Wait nago has a 6S?
[0:37:57] <PopeFantasy> 6p has upper body I frames
[0:38:18] <%Shad0wTag> Chat hear me out what if Fused I-No as a secret boss in arcade mode as a later update? It insane she's not a boss and it's just Nago
[0:38:18] <+Patch_TheSquid> @BusterRepukken then learn pad, play on pc, wait for the firmware update like everyone else. idk what to tell you.
[0:38:18] <%justmildlilac> Rev 1 didn't get announced for a long time after Sign was out
[0:38:22] <+JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> slap
[0:38:23] <gyrobasel> ok good cause i was so pissed when i got Xrd on PC just for them to announce rev1 like 2 months later
[0:38:23] <NotHereToStream> Nago has no 6S
[0:38:31] <lvl10cybermancer> Okay yeah that was confusing me
[0:38:38] <NotHereToStream> command normals for nago are 6p 6k and 6hs
[0:38:38] <stanlychicken> he meant f.S
[0:38:51] <leith_aziz> You know, once I got to see Chaos i n story, I realised he's just Ariels but actually good
[0:38:57] <SpookyMooks> hi all
[0:39:02] <Asuterisuku> Woolie: Download Complete
[0:39:13] <%natedrago> @justmildlilac you think strive is going to follow that pattern? I imagine they'll switch to a more modern "Season" approach
[0:39:14] <ElPlasa> dayum
[0:39:16] <%slayabee> Well shit Reggie
[0:39:21] <leith_aziz> @Shad0wTag Either that or Happy Chaos becomes the new boss. Either way'd be cool
[0:39:23] <Equirah> @Shad0wTag arcade and story mode clearly weren't finished by the time of release
[0:39:48] <leith_aziz> @justmildlilac They already started with seasons. I say stay that way with seasons
[0:39:51] <gtiblaziken> woolie's air 2 airs are on poinr
[0:39:57] <+RiceeFTW> @Shad0wTag "just Nago" is an understatement, boss Nago is giga buff LMFAO
[0:39:59] <%Shad0wTag> @equirah Its so weird to think this game was meant to be out in like April
[0:40:18] <Asuterisuku> This game face multiple delays.
[0:40:30] <+soulbro412> PogChamp
[0:40:30] <SomersaultJustice> is this pc or ps4?
[0:40:31] <%justmildlilac> @natedrago I see the Rev equivalents being just the main game and dlc seasons bundled together, perhaps with a new story campaign down the line. Think like the later versions of SF5 or MK11
[0:40:33] <+Prinny_Raider> I never thought about that. Just do super after blood rage to minimize bleed
[0:40:35] <+chief_chongo> cheer500 just wanted to say THANK YOU for the lore vids!
[0:40:37] <leith_aziz> C-vid really got in the way. Something tells me IK's got cut cause of the pandemic
[0:40:37] <+BusterRepukken> KOF 15 also delayed but it clearly needs it.
[0:40:41] <Equirah> @SomersaultJustice today's on pc
[0:40:42] <Asuterisuku> PC this week! PS5 was last week.
[0:40:53] <%Shad0wTag> @riceeftw I'm not shitting on Nago my guy I just mean it in the same way in SF4 you had Seth alongside with Akuma and Gouken under certain conditions at launch
[0:40:55] <Lionkevinson> Allez les Canadiens!!!
[0:40:57] <%natedrago> @justmildlilac ah okay
[0:41:03] <leith_aziz> I hope we get moe content soon. The tag stuff is genuinly cool, i'd love to see a full mode of it
[0:41:07] <leith_aziz> *more
[0:41:19] <%jolene_orenji> @leith_aziz even though they're not all that important to the gameplay I do hope they come back in an update. IKs are just a cool concept
[0:41:20] <Asuterisuku> 2v2 online team mode.
[0:41:31] <leith_aziz> @jolene_orenji Yeah, they better come back
[0:41:33] <mrsandmando> @leith_aziz Nah you meant Moe : )
[0:41:34] <+RiceeFTW> @Shad0wTag naw I mean boss Nago has a DP, unlimited blood meter, and giga guts LMAO
[0:41:35] <%natedrago> wiff
[0:41:38] <Skaab_Ruinator> Whos playing who?
[0:41:39] <leith_aziz> IK's are just a nice thing for casuals
[0:41:40] <NotHereToStream> hopefully when evo comes we will get more news
[0:41:46] <leith_aziz> They are visually awsome to pull of
[0:41:46] <Lionkevinson> woolie is nago
[0:41:49] <DrkJP520> Sup, nerds.
[0:41:49] <Asuterisuku> Woolie is Nago, Reggie is Millia.
[0:41:50] <Brandon__Brando> is this stream for glory?
[0:42:01] <mrsandmando> For fun
[0:42:03] <Asuterisuku> For Fun
[0:42:09] <%justmildlilac> woolieFUN woolieFUN woolieFUN
[0:42:09] <%natedrago> woolieFUN
[0:42:11] <codymagpie> Git 'em
[0:42:12] <SpookyMooks> we in a park? or just doing tower?
[0:42:16] <VJdarkworld> For GUILTY GEAH
[0:42:18] <%Buttface_> this is offline
[0:42:23] <%Buttface_> they're playing each other
[0:42:25] <Asuterisuku> They will likely go to a park.
[0:42:29] <leith_aziz> WHat's the difference between for Fun and for Glory?
[0:42:32] <codymagpie> oof
[0:42:39] <%Shad0wTag> @notheretostream Sony hasn't dropped any news on Evo this year have they?@brandon__brando We for fun still since they are giving pc peeps a shot
[0:42:41] <%gkingsausagelink> so how does the blood work?
[0:42:44] <%Juriasu> is woolie removing his limiters PogChamp
[0:42:47] <+Gamegenie222> for glory is try hard mode
[0:42:48] <DrkJP520> Woolie wants to change seats
[0:42:56] <elicazzz> is taking out the weights!
[0:42:58] <gtiblaziken> woolie bout to get super clapped
[0:43:02] <%Juriasu> steam should recognize it
[0:43:03] <OldManDeckardCain> nago has the blood meter, and woolie has the salt meter Kappa
[0:43:03] <Asuterisuku> Woolie switching pads.
[0:43:07] <leith_aziz> @Shad0wTag Isn't EVO planned for August? And Strive is already on the list
[0:43:07] <+RiceeFTW> I think Steam should get it for you
[0:43:07] <Lionkevinson> taking out the weights!!
[0:43:08] <Brandon__Brando> @Shad0wTag oh shit nice
[0:43:11] <VJdarkworld> driver fuckery monkaS
[0:43:15] <%slayabee> Yeah Steam should be fine
[0:43:16] <%impressionistcowboy> use the half control half mouse mutant
[0:43:23] <%FallenAngelZelos> Game tells Woolie “YOU HAVE NO TECHNIQUE!”
[0:43:28] <Asuterisuku> This game uses Steam's UI for input conversion so it SHOULD be fine. No guarantees though.
[0:43:31] <NotHereToStream> @Shad0wTag dang, hopefully its on because fighting game trailers are one of the main appeal
[0:43:34] <Lionkevinson> "this is not my final form"
[0:43:35] <user_naim> Oh we bringing out the Power Glove?
[0:43:37] <leith_aziz> Hmm, Reggie is the gambler
[0:43:48] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> theme of "leo staring into your soul"
[0:43:51] <leith_aziz> And Woolie likes going for the hard shit
[0:43:54] <%natedrago> oof
[0:43:59] <%impressionistcowboy> use the power glove to punch reggie in the face, it
[0:43:59] <%Shad0wTag> @leith_aziz I might be outta touch but I don't remember anything about sign ups for Evo yet lest we have the Smash players complain about sign ups again
[0:44:01] <VJdarkworld> i always plug in new controllers with game off just to avoid driver fuckery
[0:44:01] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:44:02] <%Buttface_> @gkingsausagelink higher blood means bigger sword, full blood means taking a ton of damage and losing all specials for a while, blood goes up from doing specials and down from landing sword moves, his command grab makes it go down A LOT for a few seconds
[0:44:04] <%natedrago> IT session lets gooooooo
[0:44:16] <leith_aziz> This theme is pretty nice
[0:44:17] <%Juriasu> Millia is a struggle sometimes
[0:44:27] <JoveGar> millia downplayers at it again
[0:44:28] <leith_aziz> Millia is about the air pressure
[0:44:35] <leith_aziz> You need to keep air dashing
[0:44:36] <Asuterisuku> Millia has to get her pressure and STAY on her pressure.
[0:44:37] <+RiceeFTW> at least Millia has Kapel
[0:44:43] <+ElDragon_1> I think PS controllers need Big Picture mode
[0:44:46] <+RowenCleric> no one can go as wild as Sol
[0:44:46] <%Blazymaniac> does steam recognize PS5 controllers properly yet? or do yu still gotta use steam beta and do a little fuckery to get it to work?
[0:44:49] <leith_aziz> Also, use Kapel to bait anti-airs
[0:44:52] <didgereedoodah> can't Millia just stay in the air
[0:44:54] <%Shad0wTag> @notheretostream our first character is this month so they might tease someone else?
[0:44:54] <Asuterisuku> Giovanna is a lot of fun.
[0:44:55] <NotHereToStream> shes a mixup queen, she needs to stay in without getting hit
[0:44:56] <Dave_VD> Gio is the exact same way
[0:44:57] <%Invlux> woolieGASM
[0:44:58] <%Irridium> millia can dash 3 times lol
[0:44:58] <+clapbeat> hell yeah millia downplayers rise up
[0:45:02] <SpookyMooks> her ground slide seems like her most likely get in
[0:45:03] <+Azhaaar> Gio is a party animal
[0:45:04] <Dyllopizzagames> Hey black dad
[0:45:04] <Brandon__Brando> when I get 0 technique I feel insulted potemkin buster requires a lot of technique
[0:45:05] <+egalitarian696969> gio has more hp and defense too
[0:45:05] <NotHereToStream> @Shad0wTag crossplay plx
[0:45:06] <leith_aziz> Giovanna is very fun casually
[0:45:08] <+Azhaaar> just dash and masch slash
[0:45:12] <%natedrago> Chipp would be a good pick too
[0:45:12] <+Azhaaar> *mash
[0:45:15] <%gkingsausagelink> @Buttface_ thank you, so he's a big gamble character
[0:45:16] <Asuterisuku> But she needs to get those clean hits as well to get real damage.
[0:45:19] <+Prinny_Raider> PICK A TOP TIER
[0:45:20] <+RiceeFTW> naw, the top tiers are just really strong right now
[0:45:23] <VJdarkworld> @blazymaniac i use dualsense just fine, no steam beta needed
[0:45:23] <leith_aziz> I play rushdown, so I main Sol and Chipp
[0:45:24] <+RiceeFTW> Sol is just ridiculous
[0:45:27] <%gkingsausagelink> gio is awesome
[0:45:28] <%Buttface_> it's not a gamble, it's more resource management
[0:45:29] <kapitankolin> gio's dash is ridiculously good
[0:45:30] <+hatefuldead666> give ky a go
[0:45:33] <+yukichocomilk> LUL
[0:45:38] <Dave_VD> Reggie should try Chipp
[0:45:39] <+Calltire3> She would be good for that LUL
[0:45:39] <leith_aziz> Want to mash? Play: Giovanna, Sol, Chipp, May or Leop

[0:45:51] <Daniel_Is_I> If you mash as Gio, you'll get read and die.
[0:45:51] <user_naim> Giovanna’s dash is fucking crazy tho. Like dash sweep has good range and combos into 214K
[0:45:52] <leith_aziz> DISCOOOORD PRESIIIIDEEEES!

[0:46:11] <lvl10cybermancer> As an Axl player I understand these feelings
[0:46:14] <+Gamegenie222> he wanna crack head mash
[0:46:19] <Brandon__Brando> @RiceeFTW he looks fun
[0:46:19] <%Buttface_> you want to balance around 2 bars for the big sword, and use your really strong specials when your blood gets low to get it back up
[0:46:20] <+BusterRepukken> you want mix up chaos, try Zato
[0:46:21] <%zanz_san> Axl player here
[0:46:21] <+Calltire3> Gio's fairly unga
[0:46:24] <%Buttface_> just can't overextend
[0:46:25] <%Th3SmartAlec> I'm only here for the shenanigans
[0:46:26] <Jodoxk1> Roll that face on the buttons coxDerp
[0:46:31] <dumpster_garbage> this maycism is unacceptable
[0:46:32] <leith_aziz> You wanna play crackhead, then Chipp's for you

[0:46:46] <%jolene_orenji> it should auto connect with big picture mode
[0:46:47] <%Shad0wTag> As a Pot main I MUST pot buster all Gio and Sol mains
[0:46:51] <ShmowzowKapow> should just work
[0:46:51] <kapitankolin> people also let gio get away with bad play because they don't know when it's safe when she's pressuring you
[0:46:51] <Asuterisuku> Big Picture just came up.
[0:46:52] <Aquaczaz> I was able to use the ps5 controller fully plug and play
[0:46:53] <taquito_blade> big screen mode just opened lol
[0:46:55] <FrostedZaibatsu> No, it works out right
[0:46:57] <ExplosionForce> @woolieversus you have to opt into the beta big picture mode for Steam
[0:46:58] <+Kiaayo> the controllers just work but it won't have fancy stuff like special rumble
[0:47:03] <FrostedZaibatsu> Use it for PSO2
[0:47:07] <darkodargon> how long has he been live
[0:47:08] <+joosta_k> might have to restart the game too
[0:47:11] <%Shad0wTag> @kapitankolin Her cannon drill should not be as safe as it is
[0:47:14] <+Davos_Southway> you just go to controller configure and check the box
[0:47:16] <+MTLxSpider> !uptime
[0:47:16] <@Moobot> @MTLxSpider WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 1 minute
[0:47:19] <VJdarkworld> make sure playstation support is on
[0:47:20] <Asuterisuku> Restarting the game means at least three minutes of waiting.
[0:47:21] <+RiceeFTW> if it's steam it should be Playstation Configuration Support
[0:47:21] <leith_aziz> @kapitankolin My issue with dealing against Giovanna players who are ghood is that Gio is never unsafe.
[0:47:25] <%ToadKing> you might have to turn on "playstation configuration support" maybe?
[0:47:35] <%justmildlilac> I miss hearing Give Me a Break as the character select music. I wish you could change it ngl
[0:47:36] <Zombrocom> Cannon drill being plus is kinda the point of the move
[0:47:36] <leith_aziz> Did you accept the Steam suppourt?
[0:47:37] <%jolene_orenji> @kapitankolin honestly I feel like I'd make the gio MU 10 x easier if I just went to training mode and tried mashing buttons during every move in her combo to figure out which isn't safe but I'm lazy
[0:47:49] <leith_aziz> @Zombrocom That move is fine since you can just 6P it
[0:47:54] <%Shad0wTag> @leith_aziz agreed, at least her dp isn't great
[0:48:16] <+PositivelyNick> technology
[0:48:19] <+FingaLights> He might need to desync
[0:48:24] <%natedrago> Blame the black tech
[0:48:24] <%Th3SmartAlec> quick, Reggie download the mods while he's distracted
[0:48:28] <leith_aziz> It's not like Gio's broken cause she's always safe. Its just hard to open her up
[0:48:34] <Equirah> @WoolieVersus to pair you have to hold the PS button and select
[0:48:37] <%zanz_san> Gundam Hathaway has so many hot looking waifus
[0:48:37] <OldManDeckardCain> pc should be the tournament standard tho Kappa
[0:48:41] <%justmildlilac> GET THOSE SUPREME COLOR MODS STAT
[0:48:45] <SpookyMooks> How's woolz feelin?
[0:48:53] <taquito_blade> honestly with pc, xbox controllers r the usual go to for controls. everything else needs constant wired connection
[0:48:55] <lycandruid> quick change his key binds
[0:48:56] <%zanz_san> Mafty is an organization of waifus
[0:49:06] <lycandruid> remove high and low kicks
[0:49:12] <+itsgundamu> Octogate for life
[0:49:21] <+Davos_Southway> Open steam setting, click the controller tab, then click General Controller Settings after which turn on playstation support.
[0:49:22] <%Invlux> It's DMCV Assist mode
[0:49:26] <%Shad0wTag> @leith_aziz She is just really appealing to everyone because she is soo good at what she does
[0:49:27] <SailorJagen> are we on the may is a piece of shit train here or may is ok train lol
[0:49:27] <VJdarkworld> octo gate breaks? monkaS
[0:49:28] <Asuterisuku> Square gate is fine.
[0:49:32] <BwdYeti> just convert everyone else to use octo too, then you'll always have one
[0:49:34] <%Shadow_Yomi> Octo is life
[0:49:48] <user_naim> We should allow early registration on the condition of random controller/stick. Make them sacrifice
[0:49:49] <Zombrocom> Gio is a knowledge check. You need to know when you can challenge and learn to react to those moments. I still struggle with the reacting part.
[0:49:50] <%ToadKing> LUL

[0:50:05] <leith_aziz> @Shad0wTag Well, Gio's appeal is that she's easy to play and looks cool. And that's completely fine.
[0:50:10] <+Sajallday> people who use octogates willingly are sickos
[0:50:10] <%zanz_san> shakes fist

[0:50:17] <Equirah> Reggie we love you LUL
[0:50:22] <MikeyxStyles> sound settings
[0:50:23] <%Juriasu> the game is now using the ds5 sound port LUL
[0:50:24] <%jolene_orenji> now the audio's coming out of the ps5 controller and not on stream
[0:50:26] <VJdarkworld> dual sense stealing the audio? monkaS
[0:50:31] <Asuterisuku> lost game audio
[0:50:36] <MikeyxStyles> dual sense is stealing audio
[0:50:38] <%ToadKing> woolie ps5 controller broke sound
[0:50:41] <leith_aziz> is octogate a controller?
[0:50:44] <%Shad0wTag> @user_naim can you imagine a top player being given a cheap third party controller on sign up? oh lord that would be funny
[0:50:45] <+Prinny_Raider> square gate for life
[0:50:45] <Equirah> @WoolieVersus sound's gone LUL
[0:50:47] <+vaporousTippler> Just carry a screwdriver and an octogate piece at all times.
[0:51:01] <gtiblaziken> octogate sounds like stolen Gamecube tech
[0:51:03] <user_naim> @shad0wtag exactly, i know i have something here
[0:51:03] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1407590785118257154?s=20
[0:51:04] <%Shad0wTag> @leith_aziz I agree dude!
[0:51:13] <VJdarkworld> dualsense took da audio monkaS
[0:51:14] <+RiceeFTW> time to walk around the tourney dealing out octogates
[0:51:15] <%Th3SmartAlec> I think it's the controller
[0:51:19] <+hatefuldead666> might come back in match
[0:51:20] <Equirah> @WoolieVersus it's outputting to the DS5
[0:51:21] <chief_chongo> @leith_aziz referring to the type of box containing the stick in a fight stick, usually its a box not an octagon
[0:51:23] <+kumaprime> I can play either, I just need less sensitive buttons for my stick
[0:51:24] <%Shad0wTag> @user_naim GIVE EM THE OLD RELIABLE MAD CATZ CONTROLLER
[0:51:24] <MikeyxStyles> it's the dual sense woolie
[0:51:25] <+hatefuldead666> happens to me sometimes too
[0:51:28] <+DscytheX> ps5 controller took over audio
[0:51:29] <didgereedoodah> did it just change the audio driver?
[0:51:32] <%Juriasu> it's using the controller same as the stick earlier
[0:51:33] <elicazzz> it come back when you play a game or change menus
[0:51:35] <%jolene_orenji> @leith_aziz most controllers use a square gate to sense the cardinal directons (sides are up down left right, corners are diagonals) but an octo gate uses an octagon
[0:51:39] <user_naim> @shad0wtag The duke
[0:51:39] <leith_aziz> This sounds more like a Steam issue
[0:51:42] <elicazzz> oh
[0:51:42] <More_Onn> Do the sound effects still work? Cause the pc has those kinds of issues if you remove an usb device
[0:51:45] <+PositivelyNick> technology

[0:51:56] <Jodoxk1> yep ps5 controller does that alot
[0:52:00] <%Invlux> LUL DS4 does that sometimes
[0:52:01] <FrostedZaibatsu> If its your first boot on pc, probably need a restart. Its goofy sometimes

[0:52:39] <@Solidus_113> FeelsBadMan
[0:52:40] <leith_aziz> Why? PC version is probably the best
[0:52:41] <%natedrago> :(
[0:52:45] <NotHereToStream> man we need crossplay soon
[0:52:46] <%adamisbarely3d> @leith_aziz octo gate is a style of control stick for arcade controllers. it has 8 switches that read direction inputs instead of combining the inputs of 4 switches like most do. it can make inputs a little easier to hit.
[0:52:50] <Asuterisuku> See you in 3 minutes
[0:52:52] <leith_aziz> PC also has the most players ironically enough
[0:52:52] <ferbeholds> come on woolie
[0:52:56] <VJdarkworld> @townzzzzz ppl connect headphones to their gamepad while they smoke weed on their couch
[0:53:02] <ZeeJiggle> Here's hoping for crossplay
[0:53:03] <+TaifuDragon> But we love you
[0:53:03] <leith_aziz> As well as very little input delay
[0:53:07] <%justmildlilac> woolieS woolieT
[0:53:10] <%justmildlilac> woolieF woolieU
[0:53:11] <KogaNoidZX> Only reason I'd get it on PC is because a lot of my friends who started FG's got it on there
[0:53:17] <Equirah> @WoolieVersus you can disable the ds4/5 as a speaker so that stops happening
[0:53:17] <%TaifuDragon> TaifuDragon subscribed with Prime. 
[0:53:19] <Asuterisuku> PC player base is twice the size of PS.
[0:53:19] <%LastHazzerd> well you actually OWN a PS5, so
[0:53:20] <%MutedMimic> woolieYE
[0:53:23] <+Arnschen> Aww
[0:53:30] <%mitchteck> I hope they add cross play soon
[0:53:32] <%jolene_orenji> yeah but what if I don't own a console
[0:53:34] <%justmildlilac> something something input delay
[0:53:42] <%Shad0wTag> I wish Sony wasn't so ass about crossplay
[0:53:46] <MikeyxStyles> but the input delay is better on pc
[0:53:53] <+FingaLights> Hopefully crossplay will be a thing
[0:53:55] <%jinking79> I'm not gonna struggle fishing everything all over again
[0:53:55] <NotHereToStream> if you play PC, just mod it the hell up and have fun
[0:53:57] <%Shad0wTag> Then Arcsys could commit to easier
[0:53:59] <Zombrocom> I just plug in my controller and it works
[0:54:00] <More_Onn> Removing a controller doesn't fully remove sound, only for the current screen, at least that's how it was for me

[0:57:13] <%ToadKing> i think that's an UE4 thing
[0:57:25] <leith_aziz> Steamworkshop is disabled I think
[0:57:27] <%slayabee> Wait are we not using Unverum?
[0:57:38] <+RiceeFTW> other games have anticheat, this game doesn't yet
[0:57:39] <Asuterisuku> uh oh booted back to title screen.
[0:57:43] <Daniel_Is_I> At least with MH, Capcom is like "no mods but also we won't really persecute it"
[0:57:45] <RealDurdyDan> Ramlethal No Mantle mod Kreygasm
[0:57:46] <leith_aziz> Which is interesting because ity implies crossplay implementation later on

[0:58:13] <+RiceeFTW> @RealDurdyDan hggTom
[0:58:25] <+hatefuldead666> its a mod manager
[0:58:26] <Daniel_Is_I> Probably a launcher
[0:58:30] <+RiceeFTW> Unverum is a mod manager/launcher
[0:58:30] <%jolene_orenji> it's a manager
[0:58:32] <%Shad0wTag> @daniel_is_i have you can have your titty mods but don't tell us
[0:58:33] <%ToadKing> unverum is a mod installer/manager
[0:58:34] <leith_aziz> Its not needed
[0:58:35] <Brandon__Brando> @leith_aziz I think they said in the beta that there trying to make cross play work
[0:58:39] <mrsandmando> Not needed
[0:58:42] <leith_aziz> you can just ddownload manually
[0:58:44] <%slayabee> Nope
[0:58:50] <%Shad0wTag> @riceeftw Does it need it?
[0:58:57] <+RiceeFTW> naw you can install them manually
[0:58:58] <@Solidus_113> it doesn't
[0:59:08] <@Solidus_113> drag and drop files works fine
[0:59:20] <leith_aziz> @leith_aziz that''s probably why Steamworkshop is disabled. disabling it actually makes crossplay ossible, I heard
[0:59:30] <@Solidus_113> your colour should be replaced by 5
[0:59:32] <@Solidus_113> or 4
[0:59:32] <leith_aziz> It replaces colors
[0:59:38] <%slayabee> @Solidus_113 Hmm... so should I just get rid of it then? Lol
[0:59:50] <Daniel_Is_I> Now for the 2-minute loading screen

[0:59:57] <+itsgundamu> Damn server got hands
[1:00:15] <NotHereToStream> 2~3 minutes
[1:00:16] <+RiceeFTW> gotta communicate with the JP server like 100 times
[1:00:20] <@Solidus_113> you can get a whole HnK match in this screen
[1:00:22] <Daniel_Is_I> For some reason you apparently are pinging the server 127 times
[1:00:24] <Asuterisuku> 127 calls to ArcSys in Japan.
[1:00:33] <KogaNoidZX> Joseph Joestar CH totsugeki: OH MY GOD
[1:00:38] <leith_aziz> The server thing seems to be location based. In Japan it takes apparenmtly 10 seconds at most
[1:00:42] <+RiceeFTW> all with your in-game fight analytics hggItsokay
[1:00:53] <@Solidus_113> hmm
[1:00:54] <leith_aziz> it seems to relate to how far away you are from the server
[1:01:03] <Daniel_Is_I> Huh.
[1:01:06] <mrsandmando> Pain.wav
[1:01:07] <Asuterisuku> 12 is PS exclusive.
[1:01:08] <ullyzeez> nice waste of time
[1:01:08] <leith_aziz> Huh,, it worked for me
[1:01:10] <ZeeJiggle> ehck
[1:01:11] <NotHereToStream> uh maybe its in gameplay and not in character selct?
[1:01:12] <More_Onn> Did you reset the game?
[1:01:13] <+itsgundamu> unzip them?
[1:01:18] <+RiceeFTW> naw it should show in character select
[1:01:20] <leith_aziz> DId you put it in the right place?
[1:01:22] <+Hollow_Mirage> nicobRekt
[1:01:22] <%townzzzzz> should had checked before teh stream
[1:01:23] <NotHereToStream> huh
[1:01:27] <%Juriasu> LUL
[1:01:29] <@Solidus_113> I got the same file and it didn't work either
[1:01:32] <leith_aziz> @Hollow_Mirage Hello, fellow Penguin
[1:01:34] <Asuterisuku> Reggie LUL
[1:01:34] <ZeeJiggle> It's aight.
[1:01:37] <xxxathanasxxx> Maybe you don't make a mods folder and just drop the mod in there?
[1:01:38] <%LazyEyed_Jalen> LazyEyed_Jalen subscribed with Prime. 
[1:01:39] <Deko_> wording LUL
[1:01:40] <+hatefuldead666> 12 is ps xclusive but theres a mod that makes color 5 color 12
[1:01:47] <%townzzzzz> I see I see
[1:01:51] <%Irridium> The reason the server connect takes so long is because it's one server in Japan that everyone has to connect too. So it takes longer the farther away you are. Why they do it like this who can say.
[1:01:53] <leith_aziz> @xxxathanasxxx You need to make a mod folder
[1:02:09] <ZeeJiggle> There's also a mod that just straight up unlocks color 12, but that one just seems risky to me.
[1:02:15] <JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[1:02:17] <leith_aziz> @Irridium It cant be all of this for the future crossplay thing, right?
[1:02:20] <+RiceeFTW> @Irridium it's not just that it connects to JP, it's that it connects to JP 100+ times
[1:02:28] <%Shad0wTag> @irridium old fashioned to say the least
[1:02:28] <leith_aziz> There's a mod that unlocks the PS colors
[1:02:30] <leith_aziz> Its great
[1:02:31] <user_naim> Apparently the connection also opens up new HTTP connections instead of usin existing ones, which also adds extra time
[1:02:34] <user_naim> iirc
[1:02:36] <%Juriasu> that beyblade finish
[1:02:39] <%Irridium> @RiceeFTW that I didn't know jesus LUL
[1:02:46] <+Ultimate_Edge> Love that blood gauge is the opposite of xfactor.
[1:02:48] <Josef_Stryker> I always find myself listening to Nago's theme. It's so fucking good Kreygasm
[1:02:53] <Josef_Stryker> *singing
[1:03:00] <leith_aziz> The server thing is weird. lets hope it gets fixed
[1:03:00] <AverageHanzo> there also seems to be a color like the black characters from XX
[1:03:01] <+RiceeFTW> it's mainly your in-game stats like your badges and stuff
[1:03:06] <%itsmostlynick> Other than after the spin. When does 6HS link after a knockdown?
[1:03:09] <$Giothegame> Starting to see Japanese players switch to PC for Strive
[1:03:13] <Asuterisuku> it's for that reason that it doesn't take nearly as long to connect in Japan, and why it won't be fixed by extension.
[1:03:24] <leith_aziz> I should listen to Nago's them more. Itss underrated at this point
[1:03:25] <+Gamegenie222> you can get a 6h after a air throw
[1:03:29] <cyclone722> I'm having trouble getting move inputs off when I want them, other than that most of the time I'm having some fun with this game.
[1:03:32] <+RiceeFTW> @Giothegame considering PS4 has 4 frames more input delay it makes sense
[1:03:39] <+Gamegenie222> pretty much it or 2s is your OTG button
[1:03:46] <leith_aziz> @Giothegame Might be because it has the least input delay and more players
[1:03:49] <%Shad0wTag> @josef_stryker I KNOW THE TIME OF DARKNESS WILL COME SOME DAY
[1:03:50] <+Gamegenie222> on Most stuff
[1:04:01] <lycandruid> !perfect
[1:04:06] <%townzzzzz> ghetto perfect
[1:04:23] <+Shishi1205> Doko miteru
[1:04:25] <lycandruid> wake up woolie BibleThump
[1:04:29] <Asuterisuku> It's what do you fight dor
[1:04:30] <leith_aziz> NOW IT'S TIME TO FEAST
[1:04:33] <$Giothegame> It's more than just the input delay though, heck Xrd had less delay than the arcade version
[1:04:41] <leith_aziz> I WONT FACE MY DOOM! SAYONARA!
[1:04:44] <$Giothegame> And players would add more input delay to the console version
[1:04:54] <gryffinp> well, japanese players would
[1:04:56] <gryffinp> who are crazy people
[1:04:59] <user_naim> That dust, every time
[1:05:00] <+Gamegenie222> not really
[1:05:04] <lycandruid> your just better
[1:05:07] <+A_DEAD_SHOW> reggie with the runback
[1:05:07] <Asuterisuku> When Hell freezes over, SAYONARA
[1:05:08] <leith_aziz> @Giothegame Then it's probably the playersbcase. PC has twice as many players as PS

[1:05:29] <+RiceeFTW> @Giothegame I've played games on steam from the west coast to JP and some connections are REALLY good (3 fr rollback) and others I'm underwater
[1:05:42] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Josef_Stryker
[1:05:44] <lycandruid> wake up woolie
[1:05:46] <%jolene_orenji> chat what's the best character theme in the game and why is it millia's
[1:05:50] <lycandruid> wake up super
[1:06:00] <$Giothegame> @RiceeFTW Not talking internet connection, PS4 has native input delay
[1:06:01] <+Shishi1205> @jolene_orenji Thats no Zato Queen
[1:06:02] <Equirah> @leith_aziz than base ps4*
[1:06:06] <mrsandmando> @jolene_orenji AH you mean Zato's?
[1:06:07] <user_naim> @jolene_orenji Here to rep Gio’s theme
[1:06:07] <gyrobasel> @jolene_orenji thats a strange way to spell faust
[1:06:08] <Zombrocom> Millias is good but the answer is Ky
[1:06:09] <+megaman_sentinel> omg
[1:06:11] <Asuterisuku> @jolene_orenji You misspelled Ram.
[1:06:12] <%jolene_orenji> zato's is also REALLY GOOD
[1:06:14] <ShmowzowKapow> real shit?
[1:06:14] <leith_aziz> I played against a guy who was in EU like me, we werre both on Wifi and the game NEVER lagged. The netcode is amazing
[1:06:16] <%Juriasu> LUL
[1:06:17] <%Invlux> LUL
[1:06:18] <NotHereToStream> theme war lets go
[1:06:18] <user_naim> Trigger is best song
[1:06:22] <+RiceeFTW> @Giothegame I know, like I said there's 4 frames MORE input delay on PS4 than on PC
[1:06:24] <+Slime_Roy> doodYelp SA-YO-NARAAAAA! SingsNote
[1:06:26] <lycandruid> noone has ever open witha raw speical
[1:06:27] <%jolene_orenji> the music in this game is so good
[1:06:34] <%Juriasu> ah the good old H disc after a wallspalt
[1:06:39] <+RiceeFTW> so less input delay and more players = better game experience for the most part
[1:06:39] <%Shad0wTag> @jolene_orenji Based Daisuke
[1:06:44] <leith_aziz> @jolene_orenji Way too many good picks. Zato, Millia, Ky, Potemkin, I-No. I probably missed more
[1:06:57] <+Shishi1205> I love I-nos
[1:07:06] <user_naim> You know what, no. DIVIDE MY HEART is best theme
[1:07:06] <$Giothegame> @RiceeFTW That's true mostly, but I think most Japanese players don't have a gaming PC
[1:07:07] <leith_aziz> If we say favorite personal dong, it's probably Zato followed by Millia
[1:07:08] <+megaman_sentinel> the air not where u want 2 b
[1:07:13] <+Gamegenie222> inos theme is pretty good
[1:07:14] <+egalitarian696969> reggie watchin some lk
[1:07:20] <Josef_Stryker> BREAK IT OUT! KEEP GRINDING!
[1:07:24] <leith_aziz> I love how much character the songs express to these, well, Characters
[1:07:28] <+RiceeFTW> @Giothegame yeah, PC gaming isn't really a normal thing in JP yet like it is in the West
[1:07:28] <+Gamegenie222> it make more sense if you look at the lyrics and watch the strive story mode
[1:07:33] <stratocast98> People are sleeping on Ram's theme way too much. And Axl's
[1:07:34] <+Slime_Roy> WELL DONE! HOW DAREEEE YOU
[1:07:39] <leith_aziz> I-No's theme is really good once you get her story
[1:07:41] <+UberWolfman> BEND THE KNEE
[1:07:43] <+Shishi1205> Rams could be better
[1:07:44] <gtiblaziken> cant believe woolie did the side-switch cheese to try and win
[1:07:47] <%Juriasu> this is a hard matchup for nago
[1:07:49] <leith_aziz> it makes the ending that much more powerfull
[1:07:52] <didgereedoodah> Axl and Ram themes are hella good
[1:07:57] <NotHereToStream> millia got to maintain that oppressiveness
[1:07:57] <Asuterisuku> I will not face the truth SAYONARA
[1:08:01] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @leith_aziz tbh didn't expect that one of my favorite themes would be Anji's, gg strive
[1:08:05] <$Giothegame> @RiceeFTW Yea it kinda feels like PC in Japan is for shmups and visual novels
[1:08:15] <leith_aziz> @didgereedoodah Yeah, Ram's theme is cool, but to me it need to get to the 2 minute mark first
[1:08:27] <+Shishi1205> Anjis second part is godlike
[1:08:30] <leith_aziz> @leith_aziz Anji's them is pretty cool
[1:08:39] <leith_aziz> BATTLECRY!
[1:08:42] <%Irridium> F

[1:08:51] <+Brentsei> @Shishi1205 ye the latter half gets me everytime
[1:08:53] <+necronomics_> faust theme is reaal fuckin good
[1:08:55] <leith_aziz> ROCK PA-RADE!
[1:09:09] <+Shishi1205> I need more people doing theme covers
[1:09:11] <leith_aziz> Damn, I forgot about Faust's them, wth.. it's way too good
[1:09:15] <Asuterisuku> Necessary Discrepancy is big prog energy. Not for everyone.

[1:09:22] <leith_aziz> I should not have forgotten Faust's theme dammity
[1:09:33] <NotHereToStream> themes are great, but name of heaven? real great too
[1:09:36] <stratocast98> The ending of Ram's theme is pure prog rock art
[1:09:50] <leith_aziz> @NotHereToStream I WISH you could play Name of Heaven online
[1:09:51] <+RiceeFTW> @Irridium every character's grab range is different and some moves extend the throwbox
[1:09:55] <leith_aziz> Name of Heaven is so good
[1:10:09] <NotHereToStream> @leith_azi me too
[1:10:15] <+RiceeFTW> plus there's wakeup grab invul timers
[1:10:19] <+RiceeFTW> I think it's like 3fr?
[1:10:26] <+kumaprime> millia's pressure is a pain to deal with
[1:10:35] <%Irridium> @RiceeFTW ah, that explains some things
[1:10:44] <leith_aziz> Grab is 2 frames. You have 3 frames of input buffer on wakeup

[1:11:16] <Chorkly> Reggie is styling
[1:11:18] <kingofjibs> I thought it was "tiny teeth like holy steel"
[1:11:34] <leith_aziz> I found it weird how much Ky and Millia looked alike in the X games. Im glad they got made to look more dsitnct from eachother
[1:11:38] <NotHereToStream> does the woolie mod have voice too?
[1:11:43] <%badjuba> badjuba subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 31 months, currently on a 31 month streak! 
[1:11:45] <leith_aziz> When I first saw them in XX, I thought they were siblings
[1:12:20] <leith_aziz> @NotHereToStream The Woolie Nago skin? Not the one that I have
[1:12:21] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:12:21] <Asuterisuku> That's probably why they changed Millia's look up for Xrd.

[1:12:41] <@Solidus_113> no online yet, just local matches
[1:12:46] <ElPlasa> @KyrenGraves If Kyren means over Nago's head then kinda, if they mean you have to block standing then no
[1:12:47] <%badjuba> This game communicates with the server more than an angry boomer in an Olive Garden
[1:12:52] <leith_aziz> @Asuterisuku And it''s for the better in all honesty. Millia's look in Xrd and Strive are great
[1:12:53] <+RiceeFTW> oh he knows the throw OS
[1:12:55] <+egalitarian696969> nice thro RC OS
[1:13:00] <$Giothegame> You sign up for LEVO Woolie or Reggie?
[1:13:02] <user_naim> @badjuba with as many requests
[1:13:07] <NotHereToStream> @leith_aziz yeah, for some reason i was expecting one of nago super to have woolie's voice going "yeyeyeyeye"
[1:13:19] <leith_aziz> LEVO is already starting no?
[1:13:26] <leith_aziz> Its clear Woolie ainty participating
[1:13:31] <+Shishi1205> Levo top 8 eu is going on yeah
[1:13:36] <Meltgar> Chat, any other character you recommend as "Fun"?

[1:13:49] <%HRDSalami654> Woolie is focused as fuck right now.
[1:13:49] <didgereedoodah> @Meltgar May
[1:13:57] <NotHereToStream> sol is dumb fun, go nuts

[1:14:07] <gyrobasel> jeez reggie
[1:14:13] <Meltgar> ONE MORE Kappa
[1:14:15] <leith_aziz> ALso check the move list
[1:14:19] <leith_aziz> It helps a lot
[1:14:26] <mrsandmando> Woolie really needs to 2 H.S more against Reggie's neutral jumps.
[1:14:27] <JaywalkingKnight> Sol is fun, Chipp is fun, May is fun, Leo is fun, Giovanna is fun. Potemkin is also fun, but it's a special kind of fun
[1:14:31] <%townzzzzz> find the answer in the air to air
[1:15:01] <SirRazzle> Is the 2k into 2d a frametrap?
[1:15:08] <leith_aziz> This result chart is pretty interesting
[1:15:11] <%justmildlilac> Man this matchup really sucks ass for Nago huh
[1:15:18] <%Shad0wTag> @leith_aziz Name of Heavens legit makes me wanna cry
[1:15:19] <leith_aziz> its always interesting when I check how I played
[1:15:30] <Asuterisuku> Heh. Russian Rushin.
[1:15:33] <+itsgundamu> If nago doesn't keep his turn yea its rough
[1:15:43] <%0rond> dangit, of course this stream falls on the one work shift I have this week
[1:15:45] <+Shishi1205> DO we know when the dlc is coming out? like day?
[1:16:10] <%Juriasu> it's planned for July but date is unknown
[1:16:14] <+Shishi1205> Ok
[1:16:17] <%JuliusGemstone> they not heading into a room yet?
[1:16:21] <+necronomics_> i wonder if im in the minority in wanting more returning characters than new characters
[1:16:22] <Meltgar> @Shishi1205 Wasn't there like a chart of dates? I think it was shown on stream
[1:16:26] <%Shad0wTag> @shishi1205 Nah just July is the first character month
[1:16:28] <leith_aziz> @Shad0wTag The moment when it happened isnt really sad. I just see it as either the "I-No fullfilling her pourpose" theme or the "Sol and Jack-o" theme
[1:16:33] <+kumaprime> it's like nago's face is on the lose a turn space on the wheel of fortune

[1:16:39] <%townzzzzz> oh man
[1:16:47] <%Shad0wTag> @juliusgemstone Not yet they are still facing each other
[1:16:50] <leith_aziz> All we know is that the DLC character is coming out this month. No idea when
[1:17:06] <KyrenGraves> Yeah, Nago's 632146S can catch opponents directly overhead. The actual super misses if they're too crossed up, so it's not the best option, but hey
[1:17:07] <Meltgar> You know, even i don't know if that leak is true, it would be weird for Baiken to not be DLC 1st pack
[1:17:15] <user_naim> ”oh i just killed myself”
[1:17:30] <%Shad0wTag> @leith_aziz Its not the scene that makes it sad I just meant the sing isolated on its when I listen to it
[1:17:32] <+necronomics_> i would imagine baiken and johnny have to be in strive, right?
[1:17:34] <mrsandmando> Woolie you gotta 2 HS those jumps NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[1:17:34] <+A_DEAD_SHOW> how's the scoreeboard?
[1:17:38] <+Shishi1205> @Meltgar I mean, the names are there
[1:17:38] <NotHereToStream> what a good ass special 214HS is
[1:17:39] <leith_aziz> @Shishi1205 1st DLC in June, "new character". 2nd DLC, "returning character". The rest are saved later on in the year
[1:17:42] <%Irridium> @Meltgar I mean Baiken was one of the last added to Xrd. It'd make sense to save her for later to get people back in
[1:17:47] <sunnythedrunk> Most Nagos just air grab or try to get in the air before her and air move at that angle from what I've played
[1:17:47] <%Juriasu> LUL
[1:17:49] <%townzzzzz> THE CALL OUTS
[1:17:52] <leith_aziz> @Shishi1205 2nd is August

[1:17:54] <+TopTieramisu> the self commentary meta

[1:18:01] <Mr_Rakjo> Downloaded

[1:18:03] <+REDtheBEAST> walrusMeow STAP
[1:18:04] <%0rond> I think it's clear the first characters would be the ones that show up in story mode and aren't in the game
[1:18:07] <Meltgar> @Irridium Oh she was the LAST?! Damn, i missed Xrd and went to REV 2...
[1:18:09] <NotHereToStream> woolie figuring it out
[1:18:11] <%0rond> so johnny and baiken are less likely
[1:18:13] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> mental corruption set in
[1:18:14] <+Shishi1205> yeah I knew the months but I didnt know if the days were known
[1:18:22] <%Shad0wTag> @necronomics_ no johnny please
[1:18:26] <+TopTieramisu> baiken is definitely coming in as DLC. gotta milk the most popular character
[1:18:34] <+A_DEAD_SHOW> woolie labbing mid battle
[1:18:35] <%Juriasu> I actually think Nago's 6P is okay vs millia if you see her in the air
[1:18:35] <+sandwichtaker> no grabbing on wake up
[1:18:36] <%jolene_orenji> no baiken no buyken am I right fellas
[1:18:37] <+TopTieramisu> not most popular to play, but you know what i mean
[1:18:42] <+Shishi1205> DLC2 is gonna have the classic characters
[1:18:45] <leith_aziz> @necronomics_ Baiken is guaranteed to show up. It's just that Baiken is so popular to the point that they'd probably save her for later on to keep your interest
[1:18:50] <+egalitarian696969> Lol don't write your book on defense
[1:18:54] <didgereedoodah> I think it makes sense to put in new characters first rather than returning people
[1:18:58] <Meltgar> Probably baiken in the 2nd DLC pack?
[1:18:59] <+egalitarian696969> or reggie is gonna read it
[1:18:59] <%natedrago> grablia rage
[1:19:05] <Meltgar> As the last one of course
[1:19:06] <+Nomad493> He did the Nago thing, he used his dry eyes and saw the weak points
[1:19:16] <mrsandmando> @TopTieramisu I doubt it, we only got 2 new characters in this game, I'd be surprised if we only got 3 or 4 new characters.
[1:19:16] <user_naim> jesus
[1:19:24] <+Shishi1205> @Nomad493 When he looks at sol and says monster lmao
[1:19:24] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1407590785118257154?s=20
[1:19:25] <leith_aziz> I'd say Baiken is prob the 3rd Season
[1:19:25] <%Shad0wTag> @jolene_orenji Honestly with how Strive is I really wanna see some new characters that are just brand new to throw is off but it'll be a while till that happens
[1:19:32] <sunnythedrunk> Woolie using the power of Talkin it Out LUL
[1:19:39] <Meltgar> @mrsandmando Wasn't Happy chaos and Big boi coffin "new" characters?
[1:19:42] <+sandwichtaker> Nago is too slow to cross him up
[1:19:42] <user_naim> Does FD prevent RISC gain? I forget
[1:19:44] <RealDurdyDan> There's a Jamaican Sol mod called Sol Badmon LUL
[1:19:46] <Meltgar> As DLC i mean
[1:19:49] <+egalitarian696969> "take the throw" *gets thrown 6 times*
[1:19:49] <leith_aziz> @user_naim Yes
[1:19:50] <+Shishi1205> @Shad0wTag wait for the DLC 3 are new
[1:19:56] <Kainkash5> @woolieversus As Nago hiw do you deal with the axl matchup?
[1:19:56] <%0rond> woolie experiencing slow vs fast characters in a nutshell
[1:19:57] <%jolene_orenji> @Shad0wTag I'm excited to see how goldlewis plays and how his funky alien coffin buddy is gonna work
[1:19:59] <user_naim> @leith_aziz thanks, seemed so
[1:20:00] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[1:20:01] <mrsandmando> @Meltgar Yeah but they
[1:20:02] <+TopTieramisu> @TopTieramisu you doubt baiken will come to this game ever?
[1:20:04] <mrsandmando> arent out yet
[1:20:04] <%GinAndRoses> batter up!
[1:20:04] <%natedrago> HOME RUN
[1:20:08] <%Invlux> LUL that WAS the game
[1:20:12] <gunstars20> LUL
[1:20:13] <+allups> reggie whjatare ya doign
[1:20:15] <%Shad0wTag> @shishi1205 Need a edit where he looks and calls him a brain dead gorilla
[1:20:24] <%0rond> happy chaos, dickinson, and asuka are for sure coming first
[1:20:30] <ullyzeez> woolie gonna pop
[1:20:34] <+Shishi1205> The Projectile quote is good enough
[1:20:37] <leith_aziz> @Meltgar Happy Chaos had a cameo in Revelator but never was seen in person. We just heard him talk, so technically he''s not new. It could still count as new charactyer
[1:20:39] <%Shad0wTag> @realdurdydan no fucking way thats GREAT
[1:20:43] <+RyTYoung> yo yo yo
[1:20:53] <Meltgar> @Meltgar Ahhh, fair enough
[1:20:59] <+kumaprime> don't get tilted
[1:20:59] <%0rond> characters who have actual models are the most likely to come first
[1:21:05] <leith_aziz> @TopTieramisu Baiken will show up. I'd be shocked as hell if she DIDNT show up
[1:21:09] <ullyzeez> coulda H do finish ta game after throw otg
[1:21:11] <user_naim> my bet is Goldlewis for first
[1:21:17] <Meltgar> @0rond Really don't like asuka, but that's just me (Design wise)
[1:21:21] <%jolene_orenji> @leith_aziz I think they meant new playable not just new new. Weren't Gio and Goldlewis in stuff as background characters before strive too?
[1:21:30] <%0rond> I liked his massive coat thing he had before more
[1:21:37] <leith_aziz> @0rond Actually, Asuka looks cool to me in this game. He looked lamne in Rev 2 personally
[1:21:42] <+TopTieramisu> @TopTieramisu then what are you doubting then?
[1:21:46] <%Shad0wTag> @jolene_orenji Its a shame the original Valentine from Overture won't ever be playable
[1:21:47] <%jolene_orenji> @Meltgar he looks like every anime twink ever except with a cool flower. I kinda liked the hood up version better
[1:21:50] <leith_aziz> Asuka in Strive actually looks pretty sharp
[1:21:54] <%bruuzer12> im honestly hoping for Goldlewis. I wanna see what funky style he has with that coffin
[1:21:56] <+Shishi1205> The thing im missing is the connection between the gear maker and the original one, when the fuck did they interact?
[1:22:04] <%Irridium> In the story they jump to a bunch of characters at the end and I'm willing to bet all those will make it in at some point
[1:22:21] <NotHereToStream> aint original the teacher to gear maker aka asuka
[1:22:22] <%jolene_orenji> @Shishi1205 IIRC the original one taught The Gear Maker magic
[1:22:24] <user_naim> @bruuzer12 his grab is going to be scary looking i bet
[1:22:25] <+Shishi1205> DLC pack 2 with baiken slayer jhonny etc
[1:22:32] <ullyzeez> coulda super,'d
[1:22:32] <$lumporr> he playin' vs chat?
[1:22:35] <%0rond> @Irridium it was just for single frames though, they easily could have used old models for them
[1:22:36] <leith_aziz> @Shishi1205 The original is Asuka's teacher/master. He is also Chronus' master, and he later on created the Conclave
[1:22:37] <gryffinp> The Original took five apprentices, one went on to be the Gear Maker, the other four went off to become the Conclave and mostly die like bitches
[1:22:37] <Meltgar> Also there's a possibility that there will be a new character in DLC PACK 2 since afterstory will pop up
[1:22:38] <+Shishi1205> @jolene_orenji yeah but when was that? Offscreen?
[1:22:40] <RealDurdyDan> @Shad0wTag I just found a WoolieVS Nago mod
[1:22:40] <%jolene_orenji> @lumporr not right now but he will later
[1:22:45] <$lumporr> @jolene_orenji ty
[1:22:46] <%Shad0wTag> @shishi1205 The Original taught magic to him and other disciples who then became the conclave
[1:23:06] <%jolene_orenji> @Shishi1205 off screen way before the events of guilty gear when Y2K happened and magic was introduced to the world
[1:23:09] <%0rond> they deadass gave happy chaos like 3 different origin stories
[1:23:17] <leith_aziz> @jolene_orenji Giovanna never showed up before
[1:23:28] <%Invlux> that got spicu
[1:23:31] <+Shishi1205> Yeah I imagined. He does say he was trapped for long
[1:23:34] <TigerClaws12> last one fr fr Kappa
[1:23:34] <ullyzeez> RC mixups on pressure man
[1:23:35] <Heefnoff> Like 4 games ago looool
[1:23:35] <%jolene_orenji> @leith_aziz oh nvm I thought she was in a manga or something
[1:23:36] <Meltgar> Yeah, Gio is your "i'm here" type, but design was good enough to be in game
[1:23:39] <+PositivelyNick> "one more"
[1:23:39] <%Shad0wTag> The original was like YOOO ELECTRONICS BAD, MAGIC GOOD and the world when lol k
[1:23:40] <+Arthasgnome> Prefer a backstory which is multiple choice
[1:23:41] <Heefnoff> Run that match bro this is SICK
[1:23:46] <+A_DEAD_SHOW> how many has reggie won and how many has wooliie won?
[1:23:49] <leith_aziz> @jolene_orenji oh, maybe she did show up before
[1:23:53] <%Shad0wTag> until Y2K and everything went bad
[1:23:53] <user_naim> One more once more
[1:23:54] <Heefnoff> 6 to 4 I think?
[1:24:06] <%jolene_orenji> @Shad0wTag except for Zepp who were like "yo what if we kept technology and also slavery"
[1:24:09] <ullyzeez> gonna pop
[1:24:09] <Meltgar> Still hoping what will happen to faust in After story DLC
[1:24:20] <+Noirtrice> i want them to bring Justice back as like the last dlc character. just for a non canon fun thing
[1:24:23] <leith_aziz> Aside from Chronus, all the Conclave memebrs are dead, right?
[1:24:29] <%0rond> somehow happy chaos is the original, i-no's other half, and the other jack-o, all at the same time
[1:24:30] <+Shishi1205> Maybe DLC2 will add Gabriel
[1:24:33] <%jolene_orenji> @Meltgar I just wanna know why he's creepy now
[1:24:37] <Meltgar> @Noirtrice Same. I love Justice's design
[1:24:37] <ullyzeez> noice
[1:24:39] <didgereedoodah> I hope After story has Ram actually say something
[1:24:39] <%Shad0wTag> @jolene_orenji Hey in Zepp's defense the slavery came AFTER
[1:24:43] <%0rond> also he went into ariels somehow at some point?
[1:24:44] <leith_aziz> @Meltgar Let's hope we find out in the story DLC
[1:24:47] <gryffinp> happy chaos is walking retconman and I kinda hate it
[1:24:50] <%jolene_orenji> @Shishi1205 god I hope so he's so cool. I love potemkin's funky wrist luigi
[1:25:03] <%Shad0wTag> @meltgar we all like mecha here like true kings
[1:25:05] <$nodnerbuil> I don't think Happy chaos is a jack-o, I think in the story mode they stated that he just overhead the name and took it up because he liked it
[1:25:07] <user_naim> @gryffinp Ret Conguy
[1:25:07] <NotHereToStream> the universal will apparently absorbed happy chaos at one point
[1:25:10] <%jolene_orenji> @Shad0wTag I'm just glad they got rid of the air slavery
[1:25:17] <leith_aziz> @0rond When Ariels decided to go evil once the Original discovered her, Ariels trapped him
[1:25:17] <+Shishi1205> We dont even know what the OG Happy chaos looks like
[1:25:25] <%Shad0wTag> @leith_aziz Yep
[1:25:27] <MikeyxStyles> send out more clones woolie, zone a lil bit to throw off the scent of rushdown lol
[1:25:27] <+Mendacii> Because of you Wools, I took the dive into Strive. and I am fucken LOVING it. Thanks my guy!
[1:25:31] <mrsandmando> I really like Happy Chaos actually.
[1:25:33] <+A_DEAD_SHOW> damn reggie got the matchup DOWN
[1:25:35] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus I can send you a working version of your colour mod if you want it before going online
[1:25:35] <%0rond> @0rond but it was implied he is what made her evil
[1:25:55] <leith_aziz> @mrsandmando I think most people like Happy Chaos. He's a good step up from Ariels
[1:25:59] <%Invlux> Woolie is hollowing out, but he's learning
[1:26:00] <Heefnoff> You'll get to run another Milia match soon don't worry lol
[1:26:03] <+egalitarian696969> Fame and LK go even so there's gotta be stuff you can do
[1:26:06] <Equirah> @NotHereToStream happy chaos (the philosopher) hid himself in the universal will (the AI he created) when he went to confront it
[1:26:06] <user_naim> What would Hotashi/Fame do?
[1:26:06] <%0rond> he was the "poison", it does make a bit of sense he is what made ariels go full joker
[1:26:13] <%Shad0wTag> @jolene_orenji Agreed but I won't lie I'd love for someone else from Zepp to be playable like the complete opposite of Pot
[1:26:16] <leith_aziz> I heard Happy Chaos sounds great in ENG, which is great since I didnt like his voice in JP
[1:26:16] <mrsandmando> Weird how Ariels never became playable.
[1:26:25] <NotHereToStream> @Equirah ah, thanks for the clarification
[1:26:25] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:26:25] <%Shad0wTag> @mrsandmando I think most folks do
[1:26:36] <%0rond> joker ariels actually acts a lot like happy chaos
[1:26:39] <Meltgar> LAB WITH WOOLIE Kappa
[1:26:40] <%0rond> she even fires a revolver
[1:26:47] <leith_aziz> @mrsandmando I think her and Robo Ky were planned to be playable in Rev 2, but budget ran out
[1:26:58] <%jolene_orenji> @Shad0wTag thinkin about the time I saw someone say "I love Pot's new design but I kinda wish he'd put the slave necklace back on" which makes sense in context but out of context WOOF YEESH
[1:26:59] <Meltgar> @leith_aziz That sucks
[1:27:15] <ShadowArcangel> Is Woolie gonna play with viewers? Just got here
[1:27:17] <leith_aziz> @0rond Yeah, but Happy Chaos is the cooler Joker, while Ariels is bootleg Joker¨
[1:27:18] <mrsandmando> @leith_aziz Boo, that woulda been super cool.
[1:27:30] <+Shishi1205> isnt the collar to prevent his muscle disease?
[1:27:35] <leith_aziz> Xrd sold poorly, if you remember
[1:27:41] <%0rond> @0rond but I got the feeling happy chaos being in her is what made her act like that
[1:27:43] <%jolene_orenji> @leith_aziz isn't Robo Ky just a floating head by rev 2
[1:27:49] <+Davos_Southway> What lobby do we go to to fight you?
[1:27:51] <%kyun_dere> touchpad on steam is split into start and select on ecah half
[1:27:53] <+Pat_Squared> use options button for resetting position, touch button is weird for some reason
[1:27:58] <%jolene_orenji> @Davos_Southway hasn't said yet but he's about to
[1:28:03] <cyclone722> I'm glad that EN VA and direction is getting better overall
[1:28:03] <photonfi> so @woolieversus how does one adapt to their opponent in any fighting game because I seem to be having issues when it comes to strive and fighting against nago with my brother?
[1:28:05] <Meltgar> @jolene_orenji zyzxOhNo . Still, Pot's design is cool af. I actually never knew the lore at first, i actually though it was armor-wise, like to protect the neck... Then woolie's videos happened
[1:28:08] <JayEarly> @jolene_orenji he’s chilling with Venom somehow
[1:28:11] <%Shad0wTag> @leith_aziz Robbie Draymond did the VA work thats Prompto from FF15
[1:28:11] <leith_aziz> @Shishi1205 In the older games, it was a bomb strapped to his neck. He just kept it in the XX games I think to not change his design
[1:28:14] <%Irridium> @jolene_orenji look maybe venom will make a lot of money at the bakery and get him a new body
[1:28:28] <Heefnoff> Wools, you can punish unpunishable thing but Drift Blue RC after you recover
[1:28:28] <$lumporr> does woolie have dash bound?
[1:28:33] <%Juriasu> yeah c.S is not the move to punish
[1:28:33] <Heefnoff> by*
[1:28:36] <leith_aziz> @jolene_orenji Yep. He lives with Venom now
[1:28:40] <+Shishi1205> @Shishi1205 Makes sense beacuse in his intros he puts it on himself
[1:28:46] <%Shad0wTag> @shishi1205 The suit he wears is dod the gigantism but the collar used to be a bomb slave collar
[1:28:46] <%jolene_orenji> @Meltgar love both pre-armor pot and post-armor pot, I kinda wish he had an alt costume but apparently devs said that alt costumes would be as hard to program as new characters so they're not making any
[1:28:53] <%andrewofbob> Does the training options include a frame track, like Skullgirls?
[1:28:53] <%0rond> I wonder if they will pull some bullshit to let sol still be playable in the next game
[1:29:01] <mrsandmando> R.I.P Kliff
[1:29:19] <%jolene_orenji> @Irridium I want a slice of life anime set in the venom bakery where various characters from guilty gear come in and hang out like a cafe
[1:29:20] <%MutedMimic> SourPls
[1:29:21] <Meltgar> Kliff was my main zyzxWaa zyzxWaa
[1:29:23] <%0rond> I hope if there's a next game axl will use i-no's guitar in his moveset
[1:29:27] <leith_aziz> ok, so does Pot's armor hold his muscles from overgrowing?
[1:29:29] <Meltgar> But he's super dead
[1:29:31] <leith_aziz> Or is it just armor?
[1:29:34] <%Shad0wTag> @cyclone722 dubs are getting better man, this isn't the early 2000's or worse the 80's-90's
[1:29:39] <mrsandmando> Sol with Potemkin esq cyborg enhancements.
[1:29:40] <+Shishi1205> Both?
[1:29:44] <+Calltire3> @0rond ok that would be sick
[1:29:45] <leith_aziz> cause I know he has a mutation that makes his upper body mass grow
[1:29:48] <%Irridium> @jolene_orenji I legit hope that's one of the dlc storie's they're doing for the season pass
[1:30:05] <leith_aziz> that's why Pot has short legs
[1:30:10] <%kyun_dere> the touchpad is split into select/start on each half on steam
[1:30:15] <%Shad0wTag> @leith_aziz Yes for his gigantism
[1:30:18] <%jolene_orenji> @leith_aziz manlet pot
[1:30:20] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @leith_aziz yes, it keeps him from becoming a muscle mountain/growing further
[1:30:22] <%Juriasu> my stick with a ps4 touchpad does this too, I don't know why
[1:30:26] <%Irridium> Potlet
[1:30:26] <+Pat_Squared> sorry share button for resetting position
[1:30:31] <+Davos_Southway> You can edit the buttons though steams controller config.
[1:30:33] <%kyun_dere> yeah you have to use share button
[1:30:37] <%jolene_orenji> @WoolieVersus I think the touchpad is weird on steam, at least it is for PS4
[1:30:45] <leith_aziz> @jolene_orenji I want a slice of life anime from Ky's house lol. You have Ky and his family and the Valentines.
[1:30:52] <Meltgar> Yeah, potemkin was a Genetic mutation, probably why he got "like that"
[1:30:56] <%townzzzzz> just share it bro
[1:30:58] <%TaifuDragon> and Sol Grandadguy
[1:30:59] <Meltgar> Still Cool af
[1:31:09] <leith_aziz> @leith_aziz That''s what I thought. Thanks for confirming
[1:31:11] <%Shad0wTag> man I just want another character from Zepp to show off black tech at Zepp
[1:31:11] <%jolene_orenji> @leith_aziz I just want a slice of life guilty gear anime. there needs to be more slice of life anime set in different worlds like that fate anime tbh
[1:31:22] <user_naim> Replace taunt
[1:31:27] <leith_aziz> Man, there's a lot to keep track of in GG lore, but I actually like it once I learn it
[1:31:34] <%0rond> @Shad0wTag crazy that gabriel still isn't playable and doesn't seem like he's planned either
[1:31:47] <leith_aziz> That's the strength of it
[1:31:51] <%jolene_orenji> @0rond air luigi too OP
[1:31:53] <%Shad0wTag> @jolene_orenji Xrd's story mode did this with Sin, Ram, Sol and Ky pretty well
[1:32:09] <%0rond> they would have to pull some contrived plot bullshit to have sol still make sense as a playable character in the next entry
[1:32:10] <Meltgar> Can't think of any "unique" thing Gabriel might have aside from GIANT MECHS
[1:32:13] <+Ultimate_Edge> Still holding hope that tomorrow on July 4th, they announce Goldlewis DLC
[1:32:18] <%jolene_orenji> @Shad0wTag yeah, I'd love to see more interactions like that
[1:32:21] <%Shad0wTag> @0rond The day we get Gabriel is when we would have to get Slayer back. They have to face off
[1:32:34] <leith_aziz> @jolene_orenji I think Arcsys should try a GG anime instead of the story mode, or at least alongside it. Though I hear only 4 peopel worked on the story in terms of aniamtion
[1:32:44] <Meltgar> @Ultimate_Edge 4th of july fireworks while he's spinning his coffin alien on the sky Kappa
[1:32:52] <%0rond> the story animation is generally pretty stiff
[1:32:54] <%Shad0wTag> @leith_aziz I think its because its just fun to read?
[1:32:59] <mrsandmando> You can grab Millia during her overhead if she's close enough
[1:33:11] <rosa89n20> oh man
[1:33:11] <leith_aziz> @Meltgar Gabriel used to spar with Slayer in the past. I'd expect big punches with lots of impact
[1:33:11] <Brandon__Brando> "well done, how dare you"
[1:33:11] <%Shad0wTag> @meltgar Basically a mech or tech Slayer
[1:33:16] <%jolene_orenji> @leith_aziz honestly if they made a GG anime that was the same style as the story mode but with more polish it'd be great. There's a lot of really cool animated moments in the story mode and a lot of "wow this is just the reused walking animation" too
[1:33:17] <%zanz_san> the running and walking looks weird in story mode
[1:33:18] <%0rond> gg animators are good at moves, not longer flowing movements
[1:33:20] <%Juriasu> 2S - 2D is probably a good punish for hair car
[1:33:28] <NotHereToStream> 214HS?
[1:33:28] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:33:28] <Meltgar> @leith_aziz Fuck that's soo cool
[1:33:35] <%Juriasu> if it's close enough
[1:33:38] <leith_aziz> @0rond The animation in the last chapter was pretty good, but yeah for the most part I get it
[1:33:43] <cyclone722> the slide is tough to punish
[1:33:56] <Heefnoff> You can punish Hair Car from a distance by doing Drift BRC after you recover from blockstun
[1:33:58] <Meltgar> @jolene_orenji You know i think there was a talk in the chat before, but that's super weird how characters don't have "specific" quotes between themselves
[1:34:01] <%Shad0wTag> @0rond hey if MK can have Scorpion be undead by default but alive and not a remnant in the story GG can do it
[1:34:01] <Meltgar> Or victory quotes
[1:34:06] <+Shishi1205> I just realised Zato's theme is 6 minutes long so they dont go crazy while labbing because they have to put hours in
[1:34:13] <$lumporr> this move only hits if you believe in the heart of the cards
[1:34:18] <user_naim> @shishi1205 lol
[1:34:28] <%jolene_orenji> @Meltgar yeah, that's weird. Did xrd have it? I forget. I think MK 11 spoiled me on stuff like that and now I want it in everything
[1:34:30] <NotHereToStream> does 214hs punish the hair car
[1:34:33] <horsebeefsupreme> I've had this game all week and haven't gone online once
[1:34:34] <ullyzeez> punish is too late and just confirm the dash in lol
[1:34:46] <%0rond> shouldn't you generally approach millia from the air
[1:34:57] <%0rond> jumps over her projectiles too
[1:35:10] <%TaifuDragon> Hair car is super minus, isn't it?
[1:35:19] <Daniel_Is_I> Nago doesn't have dashes. He has his teleport and that's it.
[1:35:19] <ullyzeez> nago hss no air dash or double jump
[1:35:21] <%Shad0wTag> @jolene_orenji I think Arc Sys could get away with a quick 3 ep OVA of the world of GG and its a dive into how people live there.
[1:35:22] <Meltgar> @jolene_orenji I mean, like an example: I-no's quote vs Justice is just her trashtalking her like she was a shellfish, but no spoiler stuff. Sorta win quotes like that
[1:35:26] <%0rond> oh, I didn't know
[1:35:38] <ullyzeez> and the projectiles only come out on knockdown
[1:35:59] <%jolene_orenji> @Meltgar I love that kinda stuff. probably got cut because of covid which is understandable. Rather have no crunch than that
[1:35:59] <%Shad0wTag> @horsebeefsupreme Take your time! Go online unless you wanna dude
[1:36:07] <%Shad0wTag> @taifudragon yup
[1:36:20] <%jolene_orenji> @Shad0wTag that'd be fun
[1:36:20] <leith_aziz> @Shad0wTag You mean like a pilot episode? I say Arcsys should try it out
[1:36:29] <ullyzeez> c.s is a good aa for nago
[1:36:55] <leith_aziz> There's a lot to these characters, having an episode focusing on a set cast alone could do alot.
[1:37:12] <Meltgar> Millia's whirlwind circle when you are on the ground the counter is to block right? or other ways?
[1:37:16] <%Shad0wTag> @leith_aziz Sorta? Nothing crazy or huge just people living in the crazy GG world and seeing it fron different perspectives. Don't do a Blazblue anime and try to cram everything in 12 episodes
[1:37:29] <%jolene_orenji> I appreciate that reggie is teaching woolie how to beat his character because whenever people ask me how to play against pot stuff I just say "lmao idk I spam it cuz it's good"
[1:37:32] <leith_aziz> Never watched the Blazblue anime but I heard it sucked
[1:37:32] <Brandon__Brando> the blood gauge is why im not picking up nago
[1:37:34] <horsebeefsupreme> o@shad0wtag oh, I am. mostly played VF, Tekken, and Solucaliber so I'm very green with GG
[1:37:35] <+lazylazejv5> Is wollie on PC?
[1:37:38] <leith_aziz> @lazylazejv5 Yes
[1:37:40] <%jolene_orenji> @lazylazejv5 yes
[1:37:48] <+lazylazejv5> What park are you going on?
[1:37:52] <+lazylazejv5> and thanks
[1:37:54] <ullyzeez> @meltgar wdym counter?
[1:37:54] <Heefnoff> Wools, I'll send you some tech to punish Hair Car on twitter
[1:38:03] <leith_aziz> I'd love to jump in, but its getting late
[1:38:05] <$lumporr> @jolene_orenji tbf pot presses few buttons, it's not always clear to people how to beat stuff they just throw out
[1:38:06] <Meltgar> @ullyzeez how to "not get hit" LUL
[1:38:08] <leith_aziz> I think I''ll just watch
[1:38:09] <%townzzzzz> oh no
[1:38:14] <+PositivelyNick> lol damn
[1:38:14] <Meltgar> or a safe way to get away from her
[1:38:20] <TigerClaws12> hot swap works well in this game @WoolieVersus

[1:46:04] <%Irridium> most of Axl's stuff is punishable if you block or he misses. especially fast characters they can literally dash in before he recovers
[1:46:09] <+Shishi1205> Zato loos amazing in strive

[1:47:20] <Heefnoff> Gg
[1:47:21] <leith_aziz> This game turns into a rave when Millia's theme starts playing
[1:47:25] <+yeknomlive> gg
[1:47:37] <+Hollow_Mirage> Say what your gonna say
[1:47:40] <Heefnoff> My b

[1:47:46] <+yeknomlive> happens
[1:47:48] <%townzzzzz> run it
[1:47:56] <Mushroom_Master> Nagos hard
[1:47:58] <leith_aziz> wow
[1:47:58] <%Shad0wTag> Woolie wants the run back for the Millia match up
[1:48:00] <gryffinp> the power move at this point would be for woolie to run up his blood gague as fast as possible and end the match
[1:48:00] <VJdarkworld> mistake aka the salty runback monkaS
[1:48:06] <+Shishi1205> you spend less time playing than in the lobby lmao
[1:48:15] <MikeyxStyles> he said no more games. "READY FOR ROUND 2!?"
[1:48:17] <+Fidranth> thirst for battle too strong
[1:48:18] <user_naim> chat on delay, can’t avoid running back
[1:48:34] <tacostarvedbeast> instant overheads are the bane of my existence
[1:48:41] <%Fidranth> Fidranth subscribed with Prime. 
[1:48:45] <Brandon__Brando> oof
[1:48:47] <mrsandmando> It's called bad moon for a reason Kappa
[1:48:51] <rokxx> SOOOOOO carry oooooon
[1:48:58] <AbsurdBlueSky> @woolieversus a special does 3/4ths a bar unless its your command dash, besides that you can dash a few times if you don't do too many all at once
[1:49:03] <leith_aziz> The only overheads I cant stand is when s Grappler gets a overhead
[1:49:03] <gryffinp> now imagine if THIS had been Dante's battle theme
[1:49:06] <Mushroom_Master> are private lobbys still buggered?
[1:49:06] <+UberWolfman> sajamVibe
[1:49:24] <Belakitu> Antiair!
[1:49:25] <+ArmoredDeath> dekillTwelve
[1:49:26] <%townzzzzz> the side chop
[1:49:26] <Meltgar> @Mushroom_Master I think so, haven't been able to play with friend with that ID Code thing
[1:49:33] <%Shad0wTag> @gryffinp This suits V more
[1:49:34] <leith_aziz> I dont ever want to see a grappler get a 50/50 ALONG with a command grab. Shit gets so stressfull. That was me when I had to play against Pot in +R
[1:49:42] <+Faultlined> kizzie2Sup
[1:49:45] <xeros720> egads, my roast is ruined
[1:49:47] <chief_chongo> the bees knees
[1:49:52] <TigerClaws12> Millia round
[1:49:54] <%0rond> rip perfect
[1:49:56] <leith_aziz> I'd say this could maybe be a Lady theme?
[1:49:56] <+yeknomlive> oh no is it going to be settled on a 1-1?
[1:49:56] <EX_shuffle> I keep seeing a Millia in ranked that stands by cabinets and waits for someone to lose, then says "loser" and exits really fast
[1:49:57] <+Incredibilly> @Mushroom_Master They work when they work but often you just can't find someone and if you do get in sometimes it just implodes for no reason.
[1:50:08] <VJdarkworld> @mushroom_master i saw moist critikal using it for viewer matches last night
[1:50:09] <%0rond> yo that music sync tho
[1:50:14] <ullyzeez> rip
[1:50:16] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @leith_aziz
[1:50:20] <+yeknomlive> gg's
[1:50:20] <%Shad0wTag> @leith_aziz It doesn't suit Lady's personality but I dog it
[1:50:20] <Heefnoff> My bad for mashing it dude
[1:50:24] <+RowenCleric> doesnt Pot have like a 50/50 with his Garuda loop in this? LUL
[1:50:28] <Mushroom_Master> I imagine its worse on PC
[1:50:40] <Heefnoff> Good games
[1:50:44] <leith_aziz> Yeah, but if you have a DP, it aint as bad
[1:50:48] <Mushroom_Master> if its stuffed for PS4/5 then its totalled for PC
[1:50:51] <%Shad0wTag> @rowencleric Yes he does unless you have an invincible wake up
[1:50:53] <EX_shuffle> holy hell that lineup
[1:50:54] <mrsandmando> @RowenCleric Yeah saw it today, super funnt
[1:50:54] <MikeyxStyles> mirror match
[1:51:07] <+yeknomlive> it's a new type
[1:51:09] <+RowenCleric> yea I think Max experienced it last night too
[1:51:13] <%Shad0wTag> We never had a mirror last week
[1:51:13] <ullyzeez> pot can 2k into 5d prety quickly won a few matches with it
[1:51:21] <+lazylazejv5> Finally made it in now not sure who to play Nago or Chipp
[1:51:25] <%Sparkseid> Well since the parks full, time to grind the tower
[1:51:30] <user_naim> I managed to stuff Gio’s ground super with Gio’s DP earlier, which I found interesting
[1:51:34] <chief_chongo> gfrPressed gfrPressed gfrPressed
[1:51:34] <tacostarvedbeast> its all the beasts fault, we don't need to change sh&t
[1:51:36] <leith_aziz> As someone who always played Arcsys games late, do the lobbies usually not work at the start? I heard DBFZ did not work at all online in the 1st week
[1:51:37] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> but I thought you liked samsho woolie Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa
[1:51:38] <user_naim> Mirror’s are always fun
[1:51:43] <VJdarkworld> samsho time monkaS
[1:51:47] <$lumporr> ayo who wants to get a match goin on oceania 3
[1:51:48] <EX_shuffle> @lazylazejv5 lets see some wall combos
[1:51:50] <+yeknomlive> mirror matches in this game i find more fun
[1:51:54] <%Shad0wTag> @leith_aziz Can confirm they didn't but for different reasons
[1:51:56] <Doublemint_Dave_> I'd say they are almost never fun
[1:51:57] <Daniel_Is_I> Gio mirrors are stupid LUL
[1:52:00] <leith_aziz> Mirrors are about showing who plays best
[1:52:04] <tacostarvedbeast> i learn so much from mirrors
[1:52:05] <AverageHanzo> May mirrors are a spectacle to behold
[1:52:05] <%TaifuDragon> Zato mirrors are like a university lesson
[1:52:07] <gryffinp> the earlier era of guilty gear music when daisuke was less shy about ripping things off
[1:52:08] <ullyzeez> pot mirrors hurt me
[1:52:08] <%townzzzzz> keep away mirrors are the worst
[1:52:10] <leith_aziz> Could make it embarissing though
[1:52:10] <mrsandmando> Zato mirror is a fucking shitshow.
[1:52:10] <EX_shuffle> Ky mirrors are obnoxious
[1:52:11] <+Hollow_Mirage> Ky Mirrors is a interesting thing
[1:52:12] <didgereedoodah> May mirrors are a good time
[1:52:13] <Brandon__Brando> pot mirrors are fun
[1:52:13] <%jinking79> mk mirrors r the worst
[1:52:14] <%jolene_orenji> thinkin about the snake mirror in smash bros brawl that's actually 60/40 because of port priority stuff
[1:52:15] <Meltgar> Pot mirror matches is just TESTOSTERONE grabbin' match Kappa

[2:03:50] <+Shishi1205> You can get the Invul frames of super but cancel it before the Spark
[2:03:51] <+RiceeFTW> iono about every character, faust has a lot of i-frames on his startup whereas some characters don't have any @Shishi1205
[2:04:06] <+Shishi1205> I've seen Pot do it
[2:04:17] <+yeknomlive> zato is the only character without a reversal super

[2:05:55] <user_naim> Amazing name
[2:05:57] <Meltgar> @Dr00_PhD Fair, it's annoying how you beat boss nago and get greeted by another boss nago even worse
[2:06:02] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> it's week 1 for woolie so it's fine

[2:07:30] <+Shishi1205> Zato put that one more
[2:07:33] <Meltgar> Zato is glass cannon wise? Good damage+poke but not that much health?
[2:07:37] <+jayw888> bad zato tbh

[2:12:19] <MikeyxStyles> MEGAFISTO
[2:12:23] <xeros720> well, he knew you could beat hammerfall
[2:12:27] <%Shad0wTag> Whoever you are in the chat GG's
[2:12:29] <$lumporr> Kitt Fisto's older brother
[2:12:33] <%jolene_orenji> mega fist is *technically* minus but if you space it right you'll never get the chance to punish it
[2:12:34] <Equirah> @WoolieVersus whats the thing you have on your thumb?
[2:12:35] <+kaindoge> there is no meme, get in the grab command

[2:13:06] <user_naim> I want a good Gio player, not that I am one myself
[2:13:07] <+Shishi1205> Divine Ky day 3?
[2:13:08] <Meltgar> Oh god
[2:13:10] <%Shad0wTag> VIP Ky? I wanna see Dragon Install
[2:13:12] <%natedrago> RTL
[2:13:20] <+CryptusMaximus> They are VERY hard to 6P actually
[2:13:24] <Doublemint_Dave_> Ah, Guilty Gear!
[2:13:31] <xeros720> like most things, people will keep doing shit until you give them a reason to stop
[2:13:35] <SirRazzle> You can also jump air grab mega fist if you read it's coming.
[2:13:36] <+timtomkitkat> Its tough to 6p megafisto with everyone
[2:13:37] <blakyoshi> Megafist has a disjointed hitbox, most 6p wont work
[2:13:39] <+RowenCleric> I dont think you can 6p megafisto
[2:13:40] <+RiceeFTW> Ky enforces the fundamentals
[2:13:43] <+timtomkitkat> Timing is pretty tight
[2:13:43] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> KY is a soft boi
[2:13:44] <+Shishi1205> He is a good boy in a game of monsters
[2:13:47] <mrsandmando> 6p doesn't work on every character because his arms are so long he hits your legs from above
[2:13:47] <%jolene_orenji> isn't black science what they call old technology in guilty gear or is that black tech
[2:13:58] <+Shishi1205> Valentine Ky
[2:13:58] <%natedrago> black tech
[2:13:59] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> black tech
[2:14:00] <VJdarkworld> Ky follows da rules
[2:14:02] <user_naim> Ky is Ryu and Sol is Ken
[2:14:03] <mrsandmando> Upper body invuln dont mean shit if he just punches your legs.
[2:14:03] <+RiceeFTW> RTL
[2:14:12] <Mushroom_Master> I played some Sol recently and felt absolutely dirty
[2:14:14] <+TitanGigante> highest percentage way to deal with megafist is air-to-airing it if you can as far as I can tell
[2:14:16] <JetpackMcQuack> a lot of people WANT to play ky
[2:14:18] <Daniel_Is_I> I hate fighting Ky so much
[2:14:18] <+TitanGigante> thats how people usually get me
[2:14:24] <Meltgar> Ky and Gio have the easiest wallbreaks with super
[2:14:24] <%natedrago> RTL!!
[2:14:24] <passserby> great fight music
[2:14:26] <Meltgar> I think
[2:14:29] <MikeyxStyles> @equirah hand wrap to protect his hands from muscle or nerve damage
[2:14:34] <user_naim> Ky vibing
[2:14:35] <didgereedoodah> what song is this?
[2:14:36] <Josef_Stryker> Wait is something wrong with Ky?
[2:14:37] <+yeknomlive> music is how i feel fighting ky

[2:15:08] <%jolene_orenji> @TitanGigante air to air against mega fist or any invuln wakeup like ky's or leo's work because you can't cancel it and the hitbox is aiming down (or hurtbox whichever hurts you I forget)

[2:18:32] <%Shad0wTag> @jolene_orenji Its fine were Pot mains all we need is a good glass of milk every morning for our chocolate chipp breakfast
[2:18:36] <Daniel_Is_I> Chipp's mixups are fucking intense
[2:18:39] <%jolene_orenji> @benderb0t still great! I saw that raw RC pot buster and woulda absolutely popped off if it hit too
[2:18:41] <Meltgar> UNGA Vs Nago Kappa
[2:18:42] <+RiceeFTW> beta blade, alpha blade, command grab, rekka, j2K
[2:18:43] <+jayw888> bottom cab is broken
[2:18:45] <+RiceeFTW> chipp is a menace
[2:18:45] <PenGia> Station broke woolz
[2:18:45] <NotHereToStream> chipp is a goddamn mosquito
[2:18:48] <+jayw888> Just stay on the top one
[2:18:54] <Meltgar> Cab broken
[2:18:57] <%0rond> how does chipp build tension so fast
[2:19:00] <MysticPyroFreak> That flash news LIES. There's no way I have the most wins out of everyone in this park ._.
[2:19:01] <%0rond> is it just apm?
[2:19:01] <+Ryrob35> That faust really gummed up that cab
[2:19:02] <@Solidus_113> I don't know how to deal with the dash up command grab
[2:19:02] <%Irridium> pretty sure the air 2k homes in on you. feels like it on you
[2:19:03] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> mmm, monke
[2:19:04] <+Shishi1205> @WoolieVersus Hifight Retwitted some tech vs J2K
[2:19:08] <sunnythedrunk> yep just dsah out and whiff punish
[2:19:09] <morow1ec> monke time
[2:19:11] <Meltgar> @0rond Hit much, get hit for much, tension gets filled fast
[2:19:16] <%jolene_orenji> @Shad0wTag thinkin about a video I saw that said "pot 2 combo to death on chipp" and it was just a guy caro pot bustering at the start of the round and then reading a jump with HPB for the kill
[2:19:25] <he1lhydra> its funny because chipp is really solid even without the gimmicks like alpha blade, the rekka is super good stagger pressure
[2:19:31] <tacostarvedbeast> accept that you will be jumped in on sounds rough af
[2:19:33] <%Irridium> at least* brain hard
[2:19:46] <%jepupu> What it this music? woolieYE
[2:19:47] <%Shad0wTag> @solidus_113 when May does it I lose my mimd
[2:19:50] <benderb0t> @jolene_orenji my favorite dirty trick is yrc into potbuster because nobody expects something so dumb but it only works once cuz then they're looking for it

[2:20:19] <%jolene_orenji> @benderb0t hey, if it's a bo3 round then it only working once means you secure a match and you're halfway there, sounds good to me
[2:20:22] <@Solidus_113> SourPls HELLFIRE HELLFIRE SourPls

[2:22:11] <didgereedoodah> that cab is actually busted
[2:22:13] <%Shad0wTag> @mysticpyrofreak It'll be based on your other games online
[2:22:26] <gunstars20> Did someone say CHAOS? SwiftRage
[2:22:26] <Applecannon63> If only they still kep Leo's rekka gimmick combined with his power bomb
[2:22:30] <Belakitu> DoorDash with thousands of your local resturant options?
[2:22:38] <+itsgundamu> Just Ex when he press

[2:22:40] <Daniel_Is_I> Churn that butter Pot
[2:22:40] <%jolene_orenji> @benderb0t that's like 90% of grapplers games is making them respect options until you just unga bunga raw pot buster and it WORKS cuz you're so deep in their head you're going for the jugular
[2:22:54] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:22:54] <%kyun_dere> thousands of local option selects to choose from
[2:22:55] <%jepupu> Oh hey Xrd main theme
[2:22:58] <Applecannon63> Expect to be command grabbed
[2:23:00] <+RiceeFTW> @jolene_orenji the scariest are the grapplers that don't throw
[2:23:10] <Daniel_Is_I> Oh I didn't know the super only went 2/3rds of the stage
[2:23:21] <gryffinp> @benderb0t something pat said on his guilty gear stream really stuck with me. he said "as a grappler, you exist within your opponent's fear"
[2:23:27] <user_naim> HEAVY DAY
[2:23:29] <%Shad0wTag> @egressanon For me as a Pot, Chipp jokes aside I really like Sol or Nago match ups
[2:23:36] <Applecannon63> BALLS TO BALLS
[2:23:44] <%jolene_orenji> @RiceeFTW ngl I can't consistently do a half circle so half the time I just abuse the fear of pot buster to do some whack stuff
[2:23:50] <Daniel_Is_I> Megafisto: the Character
[2:23:58] <+Shishi1205> With Pot vs Ram feels like you cant even play
[2:24:07] <%egressanon> @shad0wtag as axl the most fun is somehow fighting sol
[2:24:11] <mrsandmando> Poor lad couldnt get in
[2:24:12] <benderb0t> @jolene_orenji 100% just gotta hit em with the nothing personal kid
[2:24:13] <Meltgar> Fuck, i can't against that Overslash
[2:24:24] <Finchit> disappointed woolie is disappointed
[2:24:26] <+timtomkitkat> Too much jumping
[2:24:28] <user_naim> @jolene_orenji for pot can’t you do full circle?
[2:24:28] <emptyantics> Pot Vs. Axl is a nightmare
[2:24:30] <+TitanGigante> not enough slide heading
[2:24:34] <%Shad0wTag> @egressanon you gotta but those gorillas in their pen
[2:24:34] <benderb0t> @benderb0t @gryffinp it's all about the fear install absolutely
[2:24:39] <Onamar> Middle station is borked
[2:24:41] <gryffinp> lotta zatos today
[2:24:44] <user_naim> I thought that was pot’s unique little thing
[2:24:44] <emptyantics> !uptime
[2:24:44] <@Moobot> @emptyantics WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 38 minutes
[2:24:45] <@Solidus_113> all these crusty stations
[2:24:45] <+Shishi1205> that station is cursed
[2:24:46] <%Shad0wTag> holy shit 3 Zato's in 1 night?
[2:24:47] <sunnythedrunk> Forward megafist is unsafe when he lands up close

[2:30:34] <JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[2:30:44] <%jolene_orenji> @RyTYoung idk what the problem is, you can see in the top left what it is
[2:30:45] <+MoroseLoki> I'm glad yall recorded 😌
[2:30:45] <%Shad0wTag> @sunnythedrunk Gio's DP isn't invincible is it?
[2:30:48] <%egressanon> @daniel_is_i but command grab guarantees empty life bar tho
[2:30:56] <+yeknomlive> why does the flash news say this floor had 1.6 mil fights in 3 days?
[2:31:04] <+RyTYoung> @jolene_orenji yeah idk what's up
[2:31:05] <Aussie_Manny> Nah nah, I gotta go in, to assert my dominance.
[2:31:07] <mrsandmando> Millia has a good name lmao
[2:31:19] <sunnythedrunk> @Shad0wTag Nah just has a low hurtbox. Her DP kinda sucks in comparison to others even though it's still useful :(
[2:31:24] <%Shad0wTag> @yeknomlive Other people have probably used it
[2:31:33] <%jolene_orenji> @RyTYoung weird. maybe there's alternate parks if it gets full
[2:31:41] <%Shad0wTag> @sunnythedrunk Combo extender I assume?
[2:31:50] <+MoroseLoki> uno mas
[2:31:55] <emptyantics> Gio is the reason I bought this game Kreygasm

[2:32:00] <DedlokPM> doodOne
[2:32:00] <%jolene_orenji> I wonder why the dirty stations even happen, it's weird
[2:32:05] <%egressanon> woolie has a way of scaring strive into working
[2:32:06] <Aussie_Manny> One more one more, last one last one?
[2:32:14] <+RyTYoung> @jolene_orenji probably, strange that it only has 4 parks for Oceania and then like 60 for east coast
[2:32:35] <mrsandmando> Huh????
[2:32:36] <%jolene_orenji> @RyTYoung I just assumed it's cuz they expect a lot more east coasters than australians to play
[2:32:37] <%jinking79> treat it like Dante with a full RG LUL
[2:32:37] <mrsandmando> Burst???
[2:32:39] <+Shishi1205> Man GG has like at least 80 banger songs
[2:32:42] <%Shad0wTag> @jolene_orenji gorillas probably used it and broke em by mashing buttons with their hands
[2:32:45] <sunnythedrunk> @Shad0wTag yeah also you can use it out of dash which is amazing for getting to the other side of an air move and getting counterhit. Still has uses but no invincibility hurts
[2:32:45] <user_naim> jab perfect?
[2:32:47] <+timtomkitkat> Whoops
[2:32:50] <+MoroseLoki> Aaah that Health

[2:33:01] <%Shad0wTag> @rytyoung low player base there
[2:33:02] <+RyTYoung> @jolene_orenji that's fair
[2:33:02] <%kewlmyc> Just got here. So Woolie didn't download the mod?

[2:34:42] <Equirah> FWIW the mod didn't work cause wollie already had the game running LUL
[2:34:48] <MikeyxStyles> feels good to not visit sea world for awhile

[2:37:17] <JetpackMcQuack> guitar witch = best character
[2:37:25] <%Shad0wTag> @sunnythedrunk Maybe in lower level play but I'd wanna believe high level must use her a lot
[2:37:32] <Applecannon63> I mean I-no is the world so of course she's thirsty of channeling the world's thirst

[2:43:39] <+BrightOctarine> How do you join woolie's room?
[2:43:44] <Man_in_the_Red> Unist was onto somethign with throw techs giving you the turn
[2:43:48] <MysticPyroFreak> I'm EmPEFFFFF
[2:43:50] <+CryptusMaximus> The game even teaches you not to try and tech throws, but to jump. Teching is that difficult to do
[2:43:57] <%invalid_robin> What room they in?
[2:43:59] <%jolene_orenji> @BrightOctarine it's a park. Oceania 4, but it's full right now so you gotta mash A and hope

[2:44:35] <%buff_shiba> Ah. Do you hear it? That’s the gorilla anthem.
[2:44:41] <%kyun_dere> gg woolies, it was worth delaying lunch by an hour
[2:44:47] <NotHereToStream> needs more unga

[2:45:31] <ferbeholds> this is the guy that cut in
[2:45:38] <DedlokPM> Less thinking. More Gorilla. octoUnga
[2:45:38] <MysticPyroFreak> He didn't cut!
[2:45:45] <+yeknomlive> that's the thing happening in the gulf of mexico
[2:45:49] <MikeyxStyles> the stick took over sound
[2:45:51] <MysticPyroFreak> he was in line before me and moved out of it for some reason
[2:45:55] <%buff_shiba> @woolieversus did you do the fast RRC to avoid damage scaling?
[2:46:02] <VJdarkworld> the line debate monkaS
[2:46:03] <MysticPyroFreak> but I can confirm he was infront of me when I lined up
[2:46:05] <FrostedZaibatsu> In steam you can switch the main controller
[2:46:05] <$lumporr> @DedlokPM less unga more bunga
[2:46:18] <ferbeholds> @MysticPyroFreak so he dc and got back in
[2:46:20] <ferbeholds> ?
[2:46:27] <mrsandmando> Do not leave the room
[2:46:33] <%jolene_orenji> @WoolieVersus try changing the controller in shift tab or something

[2:46:42] <MysticPyroFreak> @ferbeholds I think he wandered the lobby or something. I was minimized when he got out of line
[2:46:52] <$lumporr> so is reggie taking over from now?
[2:47:05] <ferbeholds> @MysticPyroFreak because the order in wich people connect he is not nearly close to where he should be in line
[2:47:34] <ferbeholds> and i and another dude saw him just walk to someone probably a friend who let him cut in
[2:47:38] <primaryfire> still a good point you were making tho
[2:47:52] <SirRazzle> @jolene_orenji Black Tech is the name.

[2:49:12] <VJdarkworld> 🐬🐬🐬🐬
[2:49:15] <%0rond> DUDE I got to floor 9 with ram and no one accepts the match
[2:49:23] <%0rond> people are too SCURRED
[2:49:24] <%townzzzzz> you know what's MISSING, where's the versus themes
[2:49:27] <chief_chongo> i like to stay on 8f lol
[2:49:31] <ferbeholds> @0rond I know
[2:49:33] <%justmildlilac> @frostedzaibatsu Every character has two missions, iirc
[2:49:34] <%Shad0wTag> @frostedzaibatsu yup
[2:49:35] <chief_chongo> 9f is too much for me
[2:49:41] <+Shishi1205> VANISH
[2:49:44] <%0rond> i'm not even good at this game
[2:49:46] <%0rond> I never roman cancel
[2:49:47] <+Arnschen> Yeah if that happens, whenever a song would change music usually comes back
[2:49:49] <ferbeholds> everyone dodges ram for some reason
[2:49:57] <%0rond> I only ever blue burst and never absloute default
[2:49:57] <%natedrago> Jojo pose tho
[2:49:58] <chief_chongo> when i roman cancel i do it at a bad time lok

[2:50:02] <FrostedZaibatsu> @justmildlilac You know which one or section its in?
[2:50:02] <somekindofgnome> @0rond try matching with the people named "SimpOfRam" or whatever but don't play her, there's like a million
[2:50:08] <$lumporr> i am now picturing zato practicing making his shadow match his pose
[2:50:10] <%LastHazzerd> limesDance
[2:50:12] <+lazylazejv5> people avoid me as Chipp in the 7th floor
[2:50:15] <%Th3rd3> Domestic Violent
[2:50:16] <Hericknhx> Vanish in the dark chat catJAM
[2:50:16] <%Shad0wTag> @chief_chongo same, floor 7 is too easy and floor 9 has me getting killed on the regular
[2:50:30] <%zenith0111> People avoid me cause my level is 1299
[2:50:38] <%jolene_orenji> @0rond I never faultless defense as pot. I barely take damage and if someone's about to blast me with a super that'll chip me to death they DESERVE THE WIN
[2:50:40] <chief_chongo> @shad0wtag yeah it makes me wish there were more floors because i rank up semi-fast but then get slapped back down hah
[2:50:45] <$lumporr> is woolie gonna get back on at some point also?
[2:50:45] <+Shishi1205> @zenith0111 understandable
[2:50:49] <TheDrown> Ex-spousal abuse
[2:50:59] <somekindofgnome> Millia vs Zato is a fun matchup
[2:50:59] <%Shad0wTag> If I said Ram is the best character in the game would I be considered crazy?
[2:51:00] <+lazylazejv5> I was on the tenth with my sol but had no time to get into celestial
[2:51:03] <mrsandmando> Buddy you can't keep whiffing normals to use Eddie
[2:51:03] <emptyantics> Who has the highest GUTS in the game?
[2:51:03] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:51:09] <%jolene_orenji> @chief_chongo I'm stuck between winning every match in 8 and losing every match in 9 LUL
[2:51:13] <cyclone722> and here I am stuck down in floor 4 because command inputs are still tough for me
[2:51:15] <+Shishi1205> @emptyantics Gio with full meter'
[2:51:22] <+Shishi1205> ?
[2:51:24] <somekindofgnome> @Shad0wTag in terms of competitive tier? yes
[2:51:28] <chief_chongo> clearly we need a 8.5th floor
[2:51:29] <%jolene_orenji> @Shad0wTag from what I've seen she's generally high tier and also often a top 2 with sol
[2:51:30] <+lazylazejv5> @jolene_orenji i was too in floor 9 hell
[2:51:31] <+BignanasTheGawd> bazinga, rock parade
[2:51:38] <$lumporr> @Shishi1205 gio has average to bad guts i
[2:51:40] <somekindofgnome> Sol is def #1
[2:51:44] <$lumporr> @Shishi1205 i thought
[2:51:51] <+jayw888> no ones there
[2:51:52] <+Shishi1205> thats defense then
[2:51:58] <%kewlmyc> That level WutFace
[2:51:59] <+yeknomlive> let's go faust
[2:52:03] <mrsandmando> Everyone fill the gaps in the line
[2:52:03] <%zenith0111> IB is a 3 frame window which is like impossible
[2:52:06] <%BrightOctarine> BrightOctarine subscribed at Tier 1. 
[2:52:10] <VJdarkworld> monkaS
[2:52:10] <Man_in_the_Red> Instant Block doesnt let you punish anymore
[2:52:12] <benderb0t> @Shad0wTag in the corner she's got the best pressure imo yea at least hardest for me to deal with as Pot lmao
[2:52:13] <gunstars20> LUL
[2:52:16] <+lazylazejv5> IB is good but not the most important thing early meta right now
[2:52:22] <Man_in_the_Red> it only keeps them closer
[2:52:22] <%Shad0wTag> 2 Fausts in one night and no May's? what is this
[2:52:24] <+jayw888> Probably nothing to worry about unless you're trying to win tournaments
[2:52:27] <%zenith0111> IB is super important
[2:52:29] <VJdarkworld> is IB even possible on console? monkaS
[2:52:35] <%livlinn> cdawgYes kyoryuFingerguns
[2:52:36] <+Shishi1205> Anji has 5 guts
[2:52:40] <+Shishi1205> so top
[2:52:41] <chief_chongo> yeah when i watch max dood he is constantly fighting mays lol
[2:52:55] <NotHereToStream> 2frames tho
[2:52:55] <%zenith0111> If you hate getting pushed into the corner by Ram you can IB to negate all pushback
[2:52:59] <%buff_shiba> IB can let you punish. Depending on what you IB
[2:53:04] <Hideow> ib it's very hard to use it right now
[2:53:06] <+jayw888> People winning tourneys without IB tho
[2:53:11] <%BrightOctarine> I'm only a floor 8 nago. Is it still ok to join the room and fight?
[2:53:11] <+Shishi1205> Faust and Zato have 0 guts
[2:53:15] <NotHereToStream> two frames mean you read the move or you got lucky
[2:53:17] <ハクア> not much in this game, very few things are actually punishable by IB since it doesn't really change frame data, only distance
[2:53:19] <chief_chongo> whenever i IB its on accident
[2:53:19] <+jayw888> So not necessary even at the top level rn
[2:53:20] <%Shad0wTag> @benderb0t From one Pot to another I cannot stand her jump ins
[2:53:28] <$lumporr> it sucks that we have to go into matches cold
[2:53:29] <DedlokPM> yes it was
[2:53:34] <emptyantics> Mastering IB is gonna be a bitch
[2:53:42] <Hideow> high skill,low reward
[2:53:46] <%buff_shiba> That’s a good point. Right now everyone is learning how to use the defensive mechanics. You can probably still win without it.
[2:53:53] <Hideow> thx daisuke NotLikeThis
[2:53:57] <%Irridium> if you're on PS4 good luck with IB since that version's got 4 frames of delay on its own. not sure about Pro or PS5 though
[2:54:02] <+MilkyShame> what is IB?
[2:54:06] <Hericknhx> it's the Daisuke vision
[2:54:10] <Hericknhx> don't worry about it
[2:54:12] <MysticPyroFreak> please no Laust jokes I beg you
[2:54:14] <%zenith0111> If you IB you also get Positive Bonus. SUPER IMPORTANT
[2:54:16] <HollowBeansVG> time to die
[2:54:23] <+MilkyShame> ohhh
[2:54:25] <+timtomkitkat> Laust
[2:54:31] <Hideow> but the window it's VERY strict,2 f is no joke
[2:54:33] <VJdarkworld> monkaS JUST
[2:54:35] <%0rond> people IB me sometimes and I'm convinced it's by mistake
[2:54:36] <%justmildlilac> Buff Laust
[2:54:36] <shiibbae> Woolie you put fear into his mind so fucking quick
[2:54:40] <DedlokPM> Faust Laust. rooVV
[2:54:41] <MysticPyroFreak> I was prepared to fight Nago so I got blindsided
[2:54:48] <Hideow> yup
[2:54:56] <JetpackMcQuack> you gotta know
[2:54:56] <ashuckel> IB is 2
[2:54:59] <Hideow> 8 f
[2:55:01] <%zenith0111> In Xrd it was 7
[2:55:11] <emptyantics> 2 frame IB
[2:55:19] <Hideow> oh 7?it's useful then LUL
[2:55:21] <MikeyxStyles> GioGio
[2:55:26] <+Shishi1205> Just checked Nago has 590 effective health, Pot 589 and 100% tension Gio 558
[2:55:28] <%Blazymaniac> why the need to change stations? do the stations just mess up sometimes?
[2:55:30] <$lumporr> let's go gio 👏 👏 👏👏👏
[2:55:41] <ashuckel> @Blazymaniac exactly
[2:55:41] <emptyantics> KomodoHype GIO GANG RISE UP KomodoHype
[2:55:48] <%Shad0wTag> @blazymaniac yup
[2:55:50] <+Shishi1205> then anji then leo then sol
[2:55:53] <%Blazymaniac> ok
[2:56:04] <%kyun_dere> i love gio but i hate her theme so much
[2:56:07] <$lumporr> i think this gio is trying to super
[2:56:13] <Hideow> another thing,yrc or daa not only let you take your turn, it's plus on block,although it's punishible
[2:56:14] <%Shad0wTag> So chat what characters haven't we seen. Just May at this point?
[2:56:15] <fangovafang> wats good woolie n chat LuvPeekL
[2:56:20] <JetpackMcQuack> GivePLZ Gio
[2:56:20] <%jepupu> Giovanna has like only one starter: that triple-kick
[2:56:20] <+Shishi1205> @kyun_dere thank god for the jukebox
[2:56:26] <Man_in_the_Red> why not Lust Shaker Kappa
[2:56:29] <%kyun_dere> wait wtf is the jukebox
[2:56:41] <+Shishi1205> You can change the music
[2:56:45] <%kyun_dere> i have like
[2:56:50] <%kyun_dere> 25 hours in gg and i had no clue
[2:57:04] <$lumporr> @jepupu not true
[2:57:20] <sunnythedrunk> yeah Gio has a lot of starters
[2:57:20] <Hideow> @WoolieVersus did you know that some stages causes lag?I would recomend to avoid those
[2:57:21] <%jepupu> I know. It's just used so much
[2:57:23] <%buff_shiba> YATTA!!!!!
[2:57:38] <emptyantics> GIO BibleThump
[2:57:39] <+Shishi1205> eyyy first anji
[2:57:40] <%Shad0wTag> Ay an Anji!
[2:57:45] <somekindofgnome> Gio mains how good is her tension buff thing
[2:57:48] <%Shad0wTag> and still no May's
[2:57:50] <emptyantics> Anji?!
[2:57:51] <sunnythedrunk> really good
[2:57:56] <JetpackMcQuack> hell yeah
[2:57:57] <+Shishi1205> there's some saucy combos with anji
[2:58:03] <ハクア> don't challenge 5S, it's not worth it. FD it instead since it's 3 hits, she'll be out of range for most things
[2:58:04] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:58:04] <emptyantics> All the May’s are in HEAVEN
[2:58:06] <Einderr> Oh, I forgot Anji Mito was in this game, he's so forgettable
[2:58:21] <Hideow> you can jump after fuujin thou
[2:58:23] <%zenith0111> Anjis mains just not using the super parry with fuijin enougb
[2:58:23] <%buff_shiba> It’s not super game changing, but it can be clutch for extra damage and defense
[2:58:24] <+Shishi1205> godlike song choice
[2:58:26] <%Shad0wTag> @einderr doesn't help he does little in the story as well
[2:58:49] <NotHereToStream> fuujin isn't too bad to deal with
[2:58:53] <%Shad0wTag> Storyteller!~
[2:58:59] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> man older songs really are weirdly quiet
[2:59:01] <Einderr> @Shad0wTag Oh God does he not, I haven't played the story yet so I was hoping he did anything
[2:59:06] <+Shishi1205> WOWOWOW
[2:59:07] <%Shad0wTag> @notheretostream it is punishable on block
[2:59:09] <emptyantics> I haven’t fought a good Anji
[2:59:17] <+ChubbyPencil> They playing on PS4/5 or PC?
[2:59:21] <+Shishi1205> PC
[2:59:22] <$lumporr> @emptyantics they're brutal
[2:59:22] <primaryfire> those TK moons are clean
[2:59:25] <+ChubbyPencil> oh shit
[2:59:27] <%Shad0wTag> @einderr He appears in the beginning, a little in the middle and even less at the end
[2:59:31] <%jolene_orenji> @Einderr he has a couple of scenes towards the beginning but once they get to the whitehouse he doesn't really do anything

[3:18:05] <primaryfire> pot used to get a safe jump by super jumping after pot buster, for example
[3:18:05] <%0rond> nothing they don't hit
[3:18:07] <DasFreekman> so like meatys in the air?
[3:18:11] <+skylerpilot> Reggie doens't know what just happened to him
[3:18:24] <+skylerpilot> the trick is, the Chipp doesn't either
[3:18:25] <$lumporr> you have to get in reggie
[3:18:27] <+Shishi1205> Im telling you Reggie Chipp is the one for you
[3:18:30] <$lumporr> beat his ass
[3:18:35] <@Menitta> Chipp's divekick thing is super good
[3:18:37] <Daniel_Is_I> Use that dash-in 214S more Reggie!
[3:18:41] <%buff_shiba> Basically a meaty that covers some annoying wake up options. Like Sol’s Volcanic Viper

[3:19:11] <%AlteisenReiseZ> NOTHING BUT RESPECT FOR MY PRESIDENT
[3:19:11] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:19:13] <$ArCielArDor> all I know is this game rewards aggression
[3:19:18] <SirDogBear> that whiffed grab looked like it was in slow mo PogChamp
[3:19:31] <Einderr> Man, I kinda miss Chipp's longer hair from Xrd
[3:19:44] <bonebagMEL> take this man's controller away
[3:19:51] <ashuckel> whiff grabs look 5x slower than they actually are
[3:19:55] <%jolene_orenji> whoever that axl main is ahead of me GOOD LUCK YOU GOT THIS
[3:19:57] <SpookyBeef7> I keep seeing people place Chipp as a top tier character wondering why, and yeah, his aggression if he's allowed to keep going gets nuts.
[3:20:01] <$lumporr> oh we back to woolie?
[3:20:07] <$lumporr> oh god i'm scared again
[3:20:10] <$LowSkillGod> So what's the jam with this stream
[3:20:18] <Chorkly> the thing about chipp mains, is they always play like they're one hit from death
[3:20:25] <%jolene_orenji> @LowSkillGod playing with viewers in Oceania 4 park
[3:20:26] <%0rond> because they are
[3:20:28] <%Shad0wTag> @lowskillgod viewers vs Woolie right now
[3:20:42] <%Shad0wTag> @chorkly they have to play like that
[3:20:58] <SpookyBeef7> Oh, this is the PC version?
[3:21:00] <Chorkly> @Shad0wTag get those twitter combos on chip
[3:21:01] <%jolene_orenji> @Chorkly I mean it's chipp so he basically is
[3:21:02] <SirDogBear> chipp pretty much got everything PogChamp but HP BibleThump
[3:21:08] <+skylerpilot> @SpookyBeef7 Chipps offense is NUTS and OPPRESSIVE. His kit is S tier, his HP is his only downside
[3:21:26] <%Shad0wTag> @chorkly I'm a Pot main its what i gotta do
[3:21:27] <+Shishi1205> You dont need Hp when you melt your oponents

[3:25:46] <Hideow> skullgirls it's pretty cheap and have a good matchmaking and discord
[3:25:48] <bonebagMEL> this pote is MINIMALISTIC
[3:25:48] <Chorkly> You love to see it!
[3:25:49] <$lumporr> mega fisto
[3:25:53] <+MTLxSpider> rank not worth doing
[3:25:58] <@Menitta> It's much easier to understand a lot of the mechanics this time around
[3:25:59] <%Shad0wTag> IF IT WORKS IT WORKS
[3:25:59] <lvl10cybermancer> Skullgirls is hard as fuck to get into though
[3:26:00] <Afrosamasenpai> mega fisto
[3:26:05] <VJdarkworld> @daltonweakly +R is $2 on steam and has rollback so its ez to get and play with friends
[3:26:07] <MikeyxStyles> where the Mays at lol
[3:26:07] <+Shishi1205> Space your megafist people
[3:26:13] <%buff_shiba> Can nago punish forward mega fist? Cause it’s pretty negative.
[3:26:13] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:26:15] <$lumporr> @MikeyxStyles in the dumpster
[3:26:17] <%jolene_orenji> GGs!
[3:26:19] <+Shishi1205> Jump throw as a read
[3:26:20] <BluBox> Megafist is punishable if he does it in your face
[3:26:21] <Zombrocom> As nago the best thing I found for mega fist was just air grabbing him
[3:26:32] <@Menitta> man
[3:26:34] <%Shad0wTag> @buff_shiba he can get a full combo
[3:26:37] <pirateofpie> I just try to back up far enough to 6P it lol
[3:26:39] <+skylerpilot> @lvl10cybermancer not at a casual level, if you get someone who is at the same level as you. Skullgirls is just fun to hit buttons in
[3:26:44] <%jolene_orenji> a lot of air to airs work against mega fist, especially up close
[3:26:46] <Chorkly> I was trying to 6P mega fist earlier, but it's such low reward.
[3:26:52] <%Shad0wTag> 4 Zatos in one night and 0 Mays
[3:26:56] <Zombrocom> Mega fist is disjointed so it's hard to 6P
[3:27:06] <%Shad0wTag> MARINEWORLD BANNED OUT HERE
[3:27:11] <Daltonweakly> Thanks chat for the recommendations. Just downloaded BlazBlu cause it was $5 on switch
[3:27:12] <+Shishi1205> hit it
[3:27:15] <Chorkly> like if I was good I'd vapor thrust it, but an early 6p clashes and lets you cancel
[3:27:17] <Zombrocom> And he shoves his hands down into your feet
[3:27:18] <$lumporr> other gio mains, how are you on the nago matchup? i think he's my worst one
[3:27:29] <+Shishi1205> Hit the frog
[3:27:31] <%AlteisenReiseZ> VANISH INTO DAARRRRRKKKKKK
[3:27:43] <%AlteisenReiseZ> God this song is amazing
[3:27:44] <bonebagMEL> The zoo is out
[3:27:45] <+ZenVulgarity> I don't mind Nago but I have a lot of experience fighting against him
[3:28:00] <+Shishi1205> The only eddie with armor/invicibility is the one with multiple arms
[3:28:02] <Zombrocom> Best way for gio to deal with nago I think, is to not let him breath. Don't let him get into his range and pace, suffocate him, make him take risks
[3:28:05] <sunnythedrunk> @lumporr I like it a lot tbh. He really has to make hard reads to break up your pressure when you get on him
[3:28:09] <%Mathochism> @lumporr Mixed bag. I've played one that dominated me but otherwise it's generally fine.
[3:28:20] <mrsandmando> GG woolz
[3:28:23] <user_naim> Pot is weirdly fun to play against, at least in like a FT10. Feels really honest you know?
[3:28:29] <+CheyMix> seems stopping your self from using blood is a big part of nago
[3:28:33] <SirDogBear> that guys defense was intense PogChamp
[3:28:34] <%TaifuDragon> Thank you for repping the man I could not <3
[3:28:35] <$lumporr> i feel like nago's range makes it really hard to get in, how do y'all get past big sword
[3:28:38] <dormoxx__> zato looks cool as hell but i'm intimidated by the negative edge stuff
[3:28:40] <%TaifuDragon> Zato is awesome
[3:28:43] <%Shad0wTag> @user_naim Pots gotta work to get in man
[3:28:45] <sunnythedrunk> The biggest thing about Nago is to not let him deter you from being in the air. His blind spot above him is super vulnerable
[3:28:55] <$lumporr> @sunnythedrunk 6h tho?
[3:29:00] <+Shishi1205> Zato yeah
[3:29:05] <%eanscrale> you NEED negative edge to play Zato
[3:29:08] <%Mathochism> @lumporr Bait his pokes,whiff punish with dashing S.
[3:29:15] <user_naim> @shad0wtag those hammerfalls ain’t free
[3:29:16] <mrsandmando> Can't believe I won that tbh GG @WoolieVersus

[3:29:37] <user_naim> no wait
[3:29:40] <+CheyMix> AND the Valintine SKIN???
[3:29:41] <$lumporr> @Mathochism sometimes i can't get there, i guess i have to wait longer on the dash before hitting s? or just space better
[3:29:44] <+dustyjordans> complete with valentine colors PogChamp
[3:29:45] <%Shad0wTag> is that Valentine colour from Overture?
[3:29:50] <ハクア> no it's just diva from overture
[3:29:51] <+UberWolfman> Yes
[3:29:51] <EA575> ye
[3:29:51] <sunnythedrunk> @lumporr don't airdash at all. Do double jump to bait it out and superjump a lot as well. You def have to mix up the way you move but its not that scary to react and block anti airs etierh
[3:29:54] <sunnythedrunk> either
[3:30:05] <%Mathochism> @lumporr Spacing + patience is all you got.
[3:30:15] <+Shishi1205> Free wall splat baby

[3:31:07] <%Mathochism> @lumporr The match actually gets easier if he comes in to in-fight since he'll eventually burn through much of his blood bar and then his options are pretty limited.

[3:31:11] <MrAbcdeftw> Yo.
[3:31:21] <Daxalog> Does anyone know what the squiggly arrow means?

[3:31:26] <Daxalog> I have it
[3:31:31] <%TaifuDragon> @Daxalog about to rank up
[3:31:33] <$lumporr> @Mathochism the ones that stay patient and manage their blood are scary, i like the ones that pop and die
[3:31:35] <Daxalog> OHHH
[3:31:36] <+CryptusMaximus> Feel like Woolz should jump in some longer sets. I like seeing the learning process.
[3:31:39] <dormoxx__> @Daxalog due for floor promotion i think
[3:31:41] <%TaifuDragon> Or close ot ranking up
[3:31:42] <%Shad0wTag> @daxalog In ranked they win their next game and they have a rating update
[3:31:47] <+dustyjordans> @Daxalog the arrow by someone's name means they're on a win streak
[3:31:48] <+Shishi1205> Good taste
[3:31:51] <Daniel_Is_I> The rare triple-dash
[3:31:51] <thewrathofscience> I legit have no basis for what I just saw, shouldnt that have connected?
[3:31:59] <MikeyxStyles> @daxalog that's a win streak I believe

[3:39:44] <TheChapyGuy> tatsu > dp to beat people challenging, or tatsu > grab to beat blocks

[3:55:31] <Afrosamasenpai> You tried your best.
[3:55:31] <%Shad0wTag> You still did us proud
[3:55:31] <@Menitta> I guess I should buy Guilty Gear Strive on PC now that I bought a PC from Artesian Builds using the promo code WOOLIEVERSUS to save up to $100 on a new PC and this week to save up to $300 off
[3:55:32] <huskarl_zap> rest brave Potemkin :(
[3:55:43] <themightyquinn3000> Okay, so Nago character action game when?...I mean it Daisuke
[3:55:59] <TopTierHarley> Daisuke wants to do a Shmup next lol

[3:56:18] <%Shad0wTag> @themightyquinn3000 monkeys paw its Overture again
[3:56:19] <+Shishi1205> Shmup with godlike songs?
[3:56:20] <huskarl_zap> Dota action Nagoryki
[3:56:24] <chief_chongo> pretty much every guilty gear character could be main character in their own style of game
[3:56:26] <themightyquinn3000> @Shad0wTag OH NO
[3:56:26] <leupinvergon> Random bullshit go
[3:56:27] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> it wouldn't be surprising
[3:56:27] <huskarl_zap> gaming
[3:56:29] <Afrosamasenpai> HE SURE DOES
[3:56:32] <+TopTieramisu> if he makes a shmup look like strive, i'm down
[3:56:35] <ZenWarMonk> Guilty Gunner.
[3:56:36] <SirDogBear> that could be epic Contra Hard Corpse was super PogChamp
[3:56:37] <Saltmeisterr> he does
[3:56:46] <%SirGO0SE> @ZenWarMonk PogChamp
[3:56:47] <+edgeyberzerker> KOF had a shmup

[3:56:54] <mistformll> Oh wow
[3:56:58] <Captbutt> elphelt's return? kmaHehe
[3:56:58] <DasFreekman> Guilty Gear 3: Dream Dissonance
[3:57:01] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> tfw you roman cancel the 360 no scope
[3:57:02] <thewrathofscience> W
[3:57:03] <+KaosMachina> a finger is gonna curl down on the Gatcha Monkey's Paw at this rate
[3:57:03] <TheChapyGuy> on that same Nago dust route, you can add HS HS to the end as the ender for better damage
[3:57:06] <Saltmeisterr> that would be sick actually
[3:57:16] <Daxalog> POV: You're Faust
[3:57:34] <Zombrocom> I usually go for HK HKHH for nagos dust. HK HKSS is easier but a lot less blood drain
[3:57:42] <+CryptusMaximus> Yeah that Faust match was accurate
[3:57:47] <leupinvergon> Someone get faust a smmich
[3:57:50] <Zombrocom> You can get HK HKHPP on some characters
[3:58:14] <BoxNavy> :) no
[3:58:29] <Meltgar> Teleported?
[3:58:30] <+CryptusMaximus> Nobody wants to play with you Woolie :(
[3:58:34] <SirDogBear> thats the work of an enemy stand PogChamp
[3:58:35] <+orkaboi> hey guys loving the content and the stream! wanted to ask what is the best way to learn match ups?
[3:58:36] <AllAccordingToPlan> lmao I've been wondering why there's so many people in the australian lobby 4 at 8am and I finally get in and see a bunch of weirdos standing around and then at the end I see a familiar username
[3:58:38] <$lumporr> why must we choke master bruce
[3:58:52] <@Menitta> man-
[3:58:55] <%Broand> plot twist literally first match
[3:58:57] <AllAccordingToPlan> meanwhile I'm in here trying to find australians to play
[3:58:57] <Afrosamasenpai> Secretly a killer
[3:59:10] <+Shishi1205> is this Zenith in disguise
[3:59:13] <Vcom7418> @AllAccordingToPlan lul
[3:59:19] <%Shad0wTag> Yo buddy@allaccordingtoplan we made the AUS fg scene busy tonight
[3:59:25] <%SirGO0SE> secret killer PogChamp
[3:59:29] <@Menitta> @orkaboi Definitely do the mission mode. There's a mission that teaches how to deal with each character's key tool
[3:59:33] <+CryptusMaximus> Plot Twist he's in Heaven on the PS4 version
[3:59:35] <%Shad0wTag> @shishi1205 he played earlier tonight
[3:59:46] <%Irridium> you literally just hold back and you beat it
[3:59:55] <+Shishi1205> Zenith? He was on Ps4 last time
[3:59:56] <%Broand> Roman cancelling the throw is less great than it's implied
[4:00:04] <bonebagMEL> big damage
[4:00:23] <+orkaboi> @Menitta thanks!
[4:00:41] <SirDogBear> PogChamp
[4:00:48] <NotEvenSteve> need more Potemkin
[4:01:01] <%Shad0wTag> @notevensteve we've had quite a few tonight
[4:01:03] <bonebagMEL> "I meant to 6P, def didn't want a bite there" -me, If that was me
[4:01:07] <+KaosMachina> I would never have thought Guilty Gear would take inspiration from Mortal Kombat Vs. DC of all things
[4:01:12] <+CryptusMaximus> You can do that in Power Rangers actually
[4:01:12] <+Shishi1205> RC after grab is just to get the kill
[4:01:18] <+CryptusMaximus> Dash jumping
[4:01:24] <%Mathochism> fr fr
[4:01:28] <+dustyjordans> didn't slayer have a dash super jump? or something like that
[4:01:32] <+Adalore> I would like a second super, I am not counting blood rage's
[4:01:42] <%justmildlilac> I have a friend coming in soon! They're hopping on now
[4:01:50] <%Vextalyst> Vextalyst subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months! Oh noooo I forgot this was Today stuck outside. If i don't make it just want to let u know Your GG lore series has been invaluable for my decision to grab this game as i've never been good at GG and was gonna skip this entry. Keep on keeping on
[4:02:00] <DedlokPM> @KaosMachina yamero

[4:03:40] <%0rond> nooo the wake up super
[4:03:43] <%0rond> if only

[4:03:47] <Diego_Umejuarez> you DO keep ash momemtum w/ super jump
[4:03:48] <SirDogBear> Chomp Chomp PogChamp
[4:03:51] <Diego_Umejuarez> *dash
[4:04:06] <+TopTieramisu> the color for ram gives me big sniper girl from FLCL vibes
[4:04:08] <primaryfire> the stagger pressure tho
[4:04:13] <Smitteys867> What is this song called? i can never remember
[4:04:13] <+TopTieramisu> that*
[4:04:16] <%0rond> PUPPY
[4:04:25] <@Menitta> "every hole was wrong"
[4:04:27] <%SirGO0SE> so the games been pretty healthy on pc huh?
[4:04:30] <%0rond> yeyeye ram
[4:04:41] <Applecannon63> I honestly fond and sometimes hate the valentine's conceptually
[4:04:41] <@Menitta> yeee millia
[4:04:47] <velozen> @Smitteys867 drunkard does make wise remarks
[4:04:48] <%SirGO0SE> @Menitta catholic living
[4:04:57] <sleepy_pink> not quite. still getting a lot of connection problems on pc
[4:05:03] <chief_chongo> someone earlier said pc had a bigger player base but I cant verify
[4:05:04] <%Shad0wTag> @applecannon63 who do you hate the most and is elphet
[4:05:08] <moink1234> thigh physics tho
[4:05:16] <%SirGO0SE> @chief_chongo huge if true
[4:05:18] <$lumporr> wow you ever watch a match back and you're like "oh wow i literally did only one thing"
[4:05:27] <sleepy_pink> pc has had a bigger player base than basically any fighting game in history regardless, by a country mile
[4:05:28] <%Shad0wTag> @lumporr yes
[4:05:31] <%TubeMan642> Yo Trigger is making a Star Wars short
[4:05:36] <BoxNavy> is there a reason to go for the 3rd hit of nagos 5S ever
[4:06:00] <stanlychicken> blood management
[4:06:02] <+ChubbyPencil> @lumporr Mega-Fisto Mega-Fisto Mega-Fisto
[4:06:09] <sleepy_pink> @BoxNavy once you condition with nago's other options like his command grab, the last hit can be part of the mixup
[4:06:10] <$lumporr> @Shad0wTag this sucks i'm like "no i'm not dumb i'm good" and then there's a video and you're dumb
[4:06:12] <cinless> full screen hair car? questionable decision
[4:06:13] <sleepy_pink> also blood
[4:06:13] <chief_chongo> I'm very new to fighting games on pc. always heard of certain games not getting support but loving this on PC atm
[4:06:15] <3Xgilly> ill do my best but am sort of a scrub
[4:06:17] <Zombrocom> You use fSSS when you have high blood
[4:06:20] <+TopTieramisu> nago is so damn cool
[4:06:20] <Zombrocom> And can't cancel it
[4:06:25] <Applecannon63> I wish one of them didn't try to be like the blazblue's kusanagi units
[4:06:26] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> ay ggs
[4:06:32] <MikeyxStyles> you think when they make the expansion/second version of this game they'll add the old gattling combos and some of the missing tools for some characters?
[4:06:34] <BoxNavy> i see thank you guys :)
[4:06:49] <%Vextalyst> What park are these guys in?
[4:06:58] <%Shad0wTag> Second Leo of the night
[4:06:58] <ashuckel> oce 4
[4:07:00] <%SirGO0SE> @BoxNavy you have it on pc?
[4:07:02] <Applecannon63> Why couldn't they made most of the valentine's design look like Jusitce
[4:07:03] <%Shad0wTag> Gorilla Time
[4:07:04] <+dustyjordans> @Vextalyst Oceania #4
[4:07:08] <BoxNavy> @SirGO0SE ya
[4:07:08] <DedlokPM> Unga time. octoUnga
[4:07:10] <%Vextalyst> ok thx
[4:07:17] <Zombrocom> I don't think they will ever add the old gatling routes, the game is hard designed around them being gone
[4:07:23] <BoxNavy> i dont go online tho cus im a wifi warrior
[4:07:35] <sleepy_pink> respect
[4:07:41] <TopTierHarley> @applecannon63 Acting like Justice doesn't just look like a waifu under the armor lol
[4:07:42] <%SirGO0SE> red bars psaDown
[4:07:52] <%Broand> Here it is
[4:07:53] <critfumble_> that leo colour kinda slams tho
[4:07:58] <%Broand> the unga and or bunga
[4:08:06] <%SirGO0SE> im just installing it now but if you decide to go online at some point msg me :) @BoxNavy
[4:08:08] <shyguy_exe> chat, as someone who didn't play xrd, did Leo really need a command grab
[4:08:12] <chief_chongo> i dont think thats armor on justice
[4:08:14] <%jinking79> saids it in him theme too LUL
[4:08:19] <Zombrocom> Leo did not need a command grab, no
[4:08:21] <chief_chongo> you see it scream with a mouth in xrd
[4:08:25] <Applecannon63> @toptierharley at least the unarmored design if her in GG Xrd's story looks less human
[4:08:27] <BoxNavy> @SirGO0SE i will :) !!
[4:08:29] <%Shad0wTag> @boxnavy wifi outta choice or by design?
[4:08:38] <+Shishi1205> Strive combat lead is a grappler so everyone got a command grab
[4:08:43] <%Vextalyst> Dammit park is full
[4:08:44] <+Shishi1205> (almost evryone)
[4:08:51] <+Adalore> I got my entry fight stick today. It is so weird but I can finally do freaken supers reliably.
[4:08:54] <Applecannon63> SWING THE FREAKING SWORD
[4:09:09] <BoxNavy> @Shad0wTag design. the modems in the living room and i cant run a long ass cable from there to my room
[4:09:09] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1407590785118257154?s=20
[4:09:10] <chief_chongo> when you ship your best friends so hard you turn them both into nigh indestructible killing machines
[4:09:14] <DedlokPM> @Vextalyst people leave when their match is done.
[4:09:22] <3Xgilly> ggs thx for playing
[4:09:33] <Applecannon63> But seriously Justice is a perfect design of a waifu
[4:09:36] <3Xgilly> still learning the matchups
[4:09:37] <+TopTieramisu> @Shishi1205 ain't nothing wrong with that. command grabs are sick
[4:09:41] <Applecannon63> Dizzy gets a pass tho
[4:09:46] <3Xgilly> yes you can grab him in stance
[4:09:47] <%jinking79> yes
[4:09:53] <+Shishi1205> very neat
[4:09:54] <%Shad0wTag> @dedlokpm they should be leaving but some are lining back up again
[4:09:54] <Zombrocom> We need to hire some better staff in this arcade, the machines don't get cleaned often enough
[4:10:00] <+CryptusMaximus> You CAN but his standing Heavy takes him off the ground and he can go over a grab
[4:10:28] <Ragnorok64> Why is there screen tearing?
[4:10:33] <%Vextalyst> ah nice we in there
[4:10:42] <%Mathochism> @WoolieVersus Leffen is giving your GG lore videos a shoutout on the LEVO stream right now.
[4:10:49] <BoxNavy> pc version has screen tearing problems
[4:11:03] <+CryptusMaximus> It's like Max said, when Leo is in backstance you just hope God is on your side LUL
[4:11:05] <+Shishi1205> Neat
[4:11:12] <Ragnorok64> would G-Sync fix that on the players side at least?
[4:11:14] <%Proxzo> Jojo Panel at AX is coming up. I hope they show some footage of Stone Ocean!
[4:11:14] <%andrewofbob> How well does it hold framerate with v-sync?
[4:11:17] <%0rond> did they turn on v-sync?
[4:11:17] <chief_chongo> woolie was in supereyepatchwolf's top 10 satans
[4:11:25] <+Shishi1205> Leffen did watch a couple of lore vids in a drunk stream
[4:11:27] <More_Onn> i turned on vsync and the tearing stopped
[4:11:31] <ashuckel> gg
[4:11:33] <+Mrbaconator> i'm JobGrapplication, READY FOR MY INTERVIEW
[4:11:34] <Diego_Umejuarez> theres someone on this line not moving........
[4:11:35] <Applecannon63> So yes Valentines tho should've looked like justice-like gear than trying to be clones of supposed lover
[4:11:37] <huskarl_zap> NO VSYNC GAMING
[4:11:37] <%0rond> v-sync fixed screen tearing for me and I didn't ntoice frame rate issues
[4:11:41] <%andrewofbob> That's what v-sync specifically stops
[4:11:59] <%Irridium> v-sync also adds a frame of input lag which is why some people disable it
[4:12:12] <More_Onn> i got vsync on and no frame issues
[4:12:15] <%andrewofbob> g-sync is superior
[4:12:41] <chief_chongo> what about z-sync
[4:12:43] <%jolene_orenji> JobGrapplication is a Potemkin ass name
[4:12:46] <%Irridium> you can either have no tearing or a frame of delay welcome to PC. Better than PS4 though LUL
[4:13:03] <+Arek_1> I think Max usually keeps Vsync on for fighting games.
[4:13:13] <user_naim> JobGrapplication is fantastic
[4:13:14] <huskarl_zap> What about P sync?
[4:13:19] <huskarl_zap> potemkin sync
[4:13:25] <BoxNavy> pee pee sync
[4:13:46] <%andrewofbob> Skullgirls PC has an option to add 1 frame delay to match console experience
[4:13:47] <+Shishi1205> Use your projectile more LEo
[4:13:59] <+TopTieramisu> toe check
[4:14:00] <Ragnorok64> Do you feel the 4 frame difference in input lag there's supposed to be between PS4 and PC?
[4:14:17] <benderb0t> @huskarl_zap Potemkin sync is really just using pogbuster to punish
[4:14:19] <Applecannon63> I don't mind Ephlet and Ramlethal of their roles if their designs weren't Aria face in different bodies and look more gear form
[4:14:25] <DedlokPM> I still like that one "Grapplied Science" name Octo used for a bit
[4:14:38] <%Shad0wTag> 7 Zatos tonight folks
[4:14:40] <+Mrbaconator> @jolene_orenji i gave it to octopimp originally :)
[4:14:41] <+Gunnehsan> compared to the rest of the roster, how much does Nago struggle?
[4:14:42] <+Shishi1205> anotha zato
[4:14:56] <%0rond> ram looks nothing like aria
[4:14:57] <+Shishi1205> @Gunnehsan can't spam specials
[4:15:07] <%townzzzzz> she roll back it came from the ground
[4:15:09] <$lumporr> @Gunnehsan if he doesn't manage his blood he's toast
[4:15:09] <shadowkittenz> patmat
[4:15:20] <%jolene_orenji> @Mrbaconator I love all of Octopimp's names. I think my favorite he's done is AxlLow's14InchHog
[4:15:26] <+Gunnehsan> does his normals get buffed with the blood guage shenans?
[4:15:28] <%jolene_orenji> great name tho

[4:15:43] <Saltmeisterr> @jolene_orenji don't forget BigTexaCummer
[4:15:54] <%jolene_orenji> @Gunnehsan when he has high meter they get better frames, damage, and range and when he bursts it goes crazy
[4:15:58] <%jolene_orenji> @Saltmeisterr lmao
[4:16:00] <+KaosMachina> this match is some serious "Aaaaand it's gone" energy on that lifebar
[4:16:00] <Daniel_Is_I> TRICKS
[4:16:02] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> the gradiented color on non-black eddie looks really nice

[4:16:58] <BoxNavy> nago mirror oh baby
[4:17:03] <+KaosMachina> wasn't a nago mirror
[4:17:12] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> the stations can be a bit fucky sometimes for no reason
[4:17:24] <primaryfire> yeee I just don't have much nago experience
[4:17:30] <primaryfire> ggs
[4:17:33] <%BrightOctarine> That's me. Not working?
[4:17:50] <Daniel_Is_I> Back to the lab again
[4:17:51] <SpookyBeef7> Apparently unsummoning Eddie also fills the gauge quicker too?
[4:17:51] <+CryptusMaximus> Leo players on the other hand, disregard all that advice

[4:18:29] <+Shishi1205> Pot mirrors are fun
[4:18:29] <PortableBoredom> Why's everyone playing the same character
[4:18:30] <Applecannon63> VAMPIRE VS VAMPIRE
[4:18:39] <%jolene_orenji> is nago's little spin move a low or a mid?
[4:18:42] <+Gunnehsan> P1 nago is a nice palette
[4:18:46] <huskarl_zap> YOU HAVE BROKEN THE MASQURADE
[4:18:52] <Daniel_Is_I> @jolene_orenji I think it's a low
[4:18:56] <umm_idunno> the spin is a mid
[4:19:06] <%Irridium> *step step* *step step*

[4:19:30] <+KaosMachina> Okay honestly Guilty Gear and Mortal Kombat are probably the easiest fighting game crossover to write with the time nonsense on both sides
[4:19:40] <thelivingglitch307> EX air rave
[4:19:43] <+KaosMachina> This has only occurred to me looking at the lore videos
[4:19:52] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @KaosMachina possibly Soul Calibur as well
[4:19:59] <+polothegreatest> those potato mods for GG and SFV are just PunchTrees
[4:20:08] <PortableBoredom> @Shad0wTag Playing only one character is boring as hell, but I meant why is Woolie only running into other Nagoriyukis
[4:20:08] <%jolene_orenji> @KaosMachina thinkin about Geralt in SCVI where it's just like "yeah he fell in a portal and magic'd into the SC world
[4:20:13] <ohno778> FIGHT LIKE A TIEGER
[4:20:18] <sleepy_pink> damn. the RCC

[4:20:21] <+RyTYoung> Just finished watching the second my hero aca movie, those last 15 minutes were bat shit insane but overall made no sense
[4:20:26] <Diego_Umejuarez> jfc king crimson
[4:20:28] <%jolene_orenji> @PortableBoredom maybe woolie inspired a lot of his fans to pick up nago
[4:20:31] <+KaosMachina> I mean, you could just drop Raven into SC as "yeah he was just sorta around then"
[4:20:37] <%Shad0wTag> @portableboredom Because they also play Nago??
[4:20:49] <+That1blindkid> @KaosMachina or I-no
[4:20:50] <Applecannon63> Man Samsho is gonna be wierd with for adding a GG character in their game
[4:20:54] <PortableBoredom> Is the point to for for Nago dittos? I just got here.
[4:20:56] <+KaosMachina> Or Axl
[4:20:58] <PortableBoredom> *to go for
[4:21:00] <@Menitta> Nago is really cool
[4:21:01] <%jolene_orenji> @KaosMachina you could put axl or i-no into anything and it'd make sense lore-wise

[4:39:45] <%Shad0wTag> Honestly a strive stream like once a month would be dope at least
[4:39:48] <Chorkly> Damn Woolie the coward ducking out 3 games before I was up.
[4:40:15] <Chorkly> Now I can't pollute the stream with toxic gameplay.
[4:40:32] <user_naim> @chorkly he felt your power approaching
[4:40:46] <%TaifuDragon> Just gotta say, you talked me into buying this on the podcast and as shameful as that double perfect was I don't regret my purchase for a second. First fighting game, let's goooo

[4:40:51] <Bennett_Fracture> did he also stole your pie Chorkly...
[4:40:58] <+CryptusMaximus> @Chorkly May player are we?
[4:41:04] <Chorkly> @user_naim We'll all collectively decide if you didn't get to play, it's because Woolie backed down.
[4:41:05] <Lordbahamut780> anyone know whos the first DLC character yet?
[4:41:09] <user_naim> @taifudragon good attitude
[4:41:13] <+MTLxSpider> nop

[4:42:05] <+CryptusMaximus> First DLC is Baiken's thighs
