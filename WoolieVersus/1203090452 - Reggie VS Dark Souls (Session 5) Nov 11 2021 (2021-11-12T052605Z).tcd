[0:10:23] <brunoberserk> the legend of the JUBILANT Reggarth LUL
[0:10:25] <%CateHecate> honestly the fact that the entirety of darkest dungeon 1 DIDNT MATTER AT ALL is so thematically appropriate LUL
[0:10:34] <andre11dr> Yeah, there's less classes
[0:10:51] <jorniev> AND the narrator of the game is INCREDIBLE
[0:10:57] <andre11dr> But a whole bunch of new rad looking enemys
[0:10:57] <@Menitta> It's all about Yakuza Like a Dragon now
[0:11:29] <leith_aziz> That was up untill P4. P5 had development on that, but it got cut
[0:11:30] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts

[0:12:23] <leith_aziz> @andrewofbob That game was underrated. Pretty fun

[0:12:53] <leith_aziz> Take that line out of context
[0:12:56] <greatspaceadventure> yo, your guys' face cams have incredible contrast, it looks aesthetically really pleasant

[0:15:29] <%CateHecate> YEAH THATS FINE
[0:15:30] <zhenthrim213> its great
[0:15:33] <+Shishi1205> it's not ds4
[0:15:34] <%Solidnick18> i saw the bit i needed and that will be that
[0:15:38] <+silent__chief> Trying so hard to avoid spoilers
[0:15:38] <%sewermonk> ds1 + ds2 + ds3 + bloodborne + sekiro
[0:15:40] <alroy909> that's like, what I wanted
[0:15:41] <+Shishi1205> it's BIG SOULS
[0:15:46] <%Lion_kun> Woolie and Reggie Elden Ring LP let's go.
[0:15:50] <%Solidnick18> Yep
[0:15:51] <andre11dr> And  a little of Sekiro too
[0:15:53] <zhenthrim213> professinal pat
[0:15:58] <%CateHecate> there are a LOT of little reused things
[0:16:02] <%Solidnick18> It's all of them put into one
[0:16:03] <+Amaideus> When i hit the snowfield in Ashes of Ariandel I went "I want open world souls from FROM now"
[0:16:03] <%Lion_kun> Fuck spoilers. Put Reggie on the train.
[0:16:06] <didipackums1> Dumb argument LUL who doesn’t want dark souls 4?
[0:16:09] <%X2Eliah> The enemy bipedal bosses felt a bit sekiro-ish
[0:16:10] <%hiswill98> There’s a straight up dungeon that calls back to 2-1
[0:16:11] <+keiji_maede> @WoolieVersus  But friend! What if it was dragon souls? Dragon dogma souls~ xD
[0:16:13] <andre11dr> It has the stagger system of Sekiro
[0:16:14] <%X2Eliah> like real fluid
[0:16:14] <%Prevot> I'm glad it seems to not explode on a regular PS4, since that's all I got to play it on
[0:16:17] <Visorak6> Even sekiro elements
[0:16:18] <%CateHecate> the riposte and death sounds are literally the same to the point that it kinda took me out of it
[0:16:30] <zhenthrim213> i love 2
[0:16:32] <%Lion_kun> 2 is a good game.
[0:16:38] <Xaeveax> Yeah the posture system is great.
[0:16:39] <AbnormalVoid> two of ANY weapon
[0:16:43] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> 2 is a mistake
[0:16:43] <Kristoffers> even for two greatswords lol
[0:16:44] <andre11dr> 2 is a 8/10
[0:16:46] <AbnormalVoid> oh, in Elden Ring
[0:16:49] <+Shishi1205> 2 is a good game but a bad souls
[0:16:51] <GeoGio3> 2 is a good game, but not a great dark souls
[0:16:57] <%Prevot> yeah, I powerstanced two Guts style ultra greatswords when I played DS2
[0:16:58] <%CateHecate> i feel like if Dark Souls 2 were named literally anything but Dark Souls 2 it would have been much much more palatable
[0:16:59] <@Solidus_113> dual lances is fun
[0:17:01] <%PlagueOfGripes> dark 2 was VIDEO GAME
[0:17:01] <zhenthrim213> i was dual wield guts
[0:17:03] <@Solidus_113> dual twinblades
[0:17:08] <AbnormalVoid> you can powerstance ANYTHING in Dark Souls 2
[0:17:11] <%patriotrenegade> Dual spears...
[0:17:15] <gryffinp> dark souls 2 is a  better dark souls than just about any "souls-like" made by anybody else
[0:17:18] <glass_marcus> Dark souls Greatest Hits basically
[0:17:20] <fruit_pie_the_magician> fume knight is the crowning achievement of ds2
[0:17:23] <RiderSensei> sneaking and jumping from Sekiro
[0:17:28] <+kevlarkoala> playing a sorcery build for the first time in DS1 after putting it off since release and it's SO OP!
[0:17:37] <TheyCallMeVawn> Arts arent locked to weapons too
[0:17:38] <andre11dr> My opinion on.DS2 is that it's a 8/10 in a land of 9s and a 10
[0:17:39] <jett_eyes> I still think 2 is the worst out of the Fromsofts, but far from being the worst soulslike.
[0:17:39] <%mr_sups> @gryffinp true

[0:17:59] <%debrv> @kevlarkoala Welcome to the world of Sorceries, brother.
[0:18:00] <+kevlarkoala> if Elden Ring sorcery is as broken as DS1 sorcery, i'm gonna have a blast
[0:18:02] <+Shishi1205> those dlcs have one of the most greatest to worst moments in the game/series
[0:18:02] <Xaeveax> @andre11dr Agreed

[0:18:31] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:18:33] <andre11dr> The sorcery looks really cool ,also useful again
[0:18:34] <leith_aziz> Ive seen soem magic of Elden Ring. That stuff looks dope
[0:18:37] <+BananaSlammuh> Stando Powa in Dark Souls Kreygasm
[0:18:45] <%CateHecate> it actually looks like blocking will actually be useful, so i cant wait to bring back my DS1 Extra Huge Armor+Greatshield+Great Weapon build
[0:18:51] <Monkeyweed21> @kevlarkoala a sorcery build got me through my first ng+ playthrough
[0:18:52] <%Lion_kun> There is so much content
[0:19:02] <%Lion_kun> Pat missed two bosses.
[0:19:03] <%Solidnick18> Wow
[0:19:09] <%Solidnick18> that's nuts
[0:19:11] <Reveresao> @WoolieVersus Was it  Iron Pineapple?
[0:19:14] <Monkeyweed21> I really hope they dont nerf magic before launch like DS3
[0:19:16] <andre11dr> Also it has stuff that reminds me of some mode ,like the summoning spell reminds me of that Jojo mod
[0:19:20] <leith_aziz> To me, I dont wanna hear about how big a map is. Thats not always a good thing
[0:19:22] <+silent__chief> Doesn't matter if it's empty
[0:19:24] <@Menitta> "we put all of Ohio in our game"
[0:19:26] <%debrv> @kevlarkoala Don't worry.... You are forgiven.
[0:19:26] <AbnormalVoid> that's one of my biggest worries
[0:19:28] <%Lion_kun> Like Skyrim
[0:19:29] <%X2Eliah> just cause was real dull
[0:19:33] <+ReallyBigRocks> FUEL
[0:19:39] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Just Cause 3 is an entire nation
[0:19:40] <Chatterbox1991> GTA5 has that the worst
[0:19:41] <MajorOcelot6> Metal Gear Solid 5 suffers from that as well
[0:19:42] <%PlagueOfGripes> dragon's dogma wasn't big but it does take a while to get anywhere on foot
[0:19:42] <zhenthrim213> if its like genshin then good
[0:19:43] <+mechslayer71> cyberpunk was terrible with that
[0:19:44] <leith_aziz> Or you do it like Unity where everything's littered with collectibles
[0:19:46] <+silent__chief> Giant parts of Dragon's Dogma map were boring/empty
[0:19:47] <%Juriasu> @Lion_kun skyrim has a dungeon like evry five steps though
[0:19:47] <+ReallyBigRocks> 15,000 square KM of literally nothing
[0:19:52] <DapperCadavr> Can't wait for the rave at Blightcon today
[0:19:54] <AbnormalVoid> Breath of the Wild is a fun 15 hours in a 50 hours game
[0:19:54] <leith_aziz> *Ubisoft
[0:20:06] <MajorOcelot6> Cyberpunk 2077 did have that as well
[0:20:19] <%Indigo_Automaton> Just Cause at least has fun traversal, but yeah the map's miles wide and inches deep
[0:20:26] <Reveresao> @WoolieVersus Was it  Iron Pineapple?
[0:20:35] <Xaeveax> I didn't get in either
[0:20:50] <+mechslayer71> they sent me an email to tell me I didn't get in Sadge
[0:20:53] <TaloKur29> Hello there.
[0:20:54] <andre11dr> It's seems to be packed with shit ,even jumping to the side before the castle entrance leads you to a bunch of wierd snake things
[0:20:54] <@Menitta> I didnt even get a rejection email
[0:21:00] <leith_aziz> @MajorOcelot6 Was that the case? Welp. Witcher 3 was kinda filled as well, but I'd say the content on the map was usually engaging

[0:21:02] <greatspaceadventure> this game is looking like the Dark Souls killer. and if ANYONE was gonna make the Dark Souls killer, it was gonna be From
[0:21:03] <+Reverend_Roscoe> what did i miss?
[0:21:15] <%CateHecate> the only thing i can hope for would be that enemies on the overworld more or less scale to your level rather than being already at their own levels so you can truly wander in any direction without being herded into lower level areas first

[0:21:39] <NeoNeonNero> @Reverend_Roscoe you missed Woolie talking about black basterds
[0:21:49] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[0:21:50] <nxflre> Blightcon Day 2
[0:21:52] <Zeif00> it's time LUL
[0:21:52] <TaloKur29> @greatspaceadventure bastHi
[0:21:56] <leith_aziz> I kinda wish we had more to talk about
[0:22:00] <Xaeveax> BLIGHTCON2021 is officially open for business! Day 2 is sure to be full of wonderful booths and special guests.
[0:22:03] <%CateHecate> The panel is at 2 pm
[0:22:04] <Monkeyweed21> the two open world styles that seem to work are super condensed and detailed with content on every corner like Yakuza or using vast swathes of empty land as a pacing tool ala BotW or Death Stranding. Elden ring seems like the late
[0:22:04] <SheefEatsBeef> the second night
[0:22:05] <gryffinp> woolie vs solitude
[0:22:07] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @neoneonnero woolie always talks about that, he loves Liam Neeson
[0:22:07] <leith_aziz> I enjoy discussions like these.
[0:22:08] <zhenthrim213> THE PANELS ARE STARTING
[0:22:08] <greatspaceadventure> so apparently Metroid Prime remake is "done"? But this is like the third time we've heard about it?
[0:22:09] <jett_eyes> The advertisment took Reggie
[0:22:11] <oneimportantthing> BlightCon Day 2
[0:22:12] <%Prevot> man even the title screen of Elden Ring is fucking identical to this
[0:22:13] <greatspaceadventure> sorry, remaster
[0:22:14] <andre11dr> DAY2 OF BLIGHTCON
[0:22:15] <%debrv> Blightcon: Day 2. The events are starting/
[0:22:23] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I'm ready for Spider Momma Milkers
[0:22:29] <didipackums1> What’s on the schedule at Blightcon today?
[0:22:31] <NeoNeonNero> @Reverend_Roscoe he sure does
[0:22:36] <+mecha_11> So what qualifies as the dealers room? The bottom floor?
[0:22:36] <andre11dr> Quick rush to the anime panel
[0:22:46] <zhenthrim213> @BallerSwagBro9k im ready for him to stumble into the tree
[0:22:47] <+Amaideus> BoTW isn't THAT empty tbh, but I'm also a Korok addict. It only gets real bad in the snow and sand regions IMO
[0:22:51] <+kevlarkoala> Blightcon got him already, eh?
[0:22:52] <%CateHecate> better than a fromsoft game with a story by GRMM: a fromsoft game with a story by hideaki anno
[0:22:53] <%CateHecate> LUL
[0:23:03] <+kevlarkoala> he got that Blightcon flu?
[0:23:10] <%PlagueOfGripes> blowing out all the doughnut dust
[0:23:29] <%Juriasu> @CateHecate Shin Dark Souls hell yeah
[0:23:37] <gryffinp> jammin out to that file select theme
[0:23:39] <nxflre> yo Pockeets with 83 hrs???
[0:23:45] <NeoNeonNero> LUL
[0:23:46] <Monkeyweed21> @Amaideus yea but the fact that there's a significant stretch of land between,say, Kakariko and Hateno is important for the tone and pacing of the game
[0:23:47] <+RyTYoung> LUL
[0:23:49] <available_line> Pockets still sitting there, with her 110 levels
[0:23:49] <GeoGio3> BLIGHTCON! yeyeyey woolieGASM 2020Snacking

[0:24:14] <didipackums1> We back we back we back
[0:24:16] <+MashinChaserR> a town of blight you might say
[0:24:19] <andre11dr> There's a sky at least
[0:24:20] <Arqartur0> It's kinda weird, but also conforting to listen to the stream while I work, it's kinda like working in the appartment while your roomates talk about the game, you don't feel as alone for a while... Also, why am I crying?
[0:24:20] <+Amaideus> Welcome back to Fuck!
[0:24:21] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[0:24:24] <+mechslayer71> ITS DOODOO BABY
[0:24:31] <available_line> Blitthown is unironically one of the best video game levels ever designed.
[0:24:32] <Omentus> shits coming at you at all angles AT ALL TIMES
[0:24:36] <%Prevot> why does Reggarth have stank lines on him
[0:24:37] <greatspaceadventure> @Arqartur0 are you me? commenCry commenCry commenCry
[0:24:38] <%CateHecate> PooPooPeePee Town
[0:24:47] <leith_aziz> The more I pay attention to it, I realise Im shit at dealing with people being negative about games (unless its complete trash or the devs are trash). Even if its a game I've never played, it always feels like shit. wtf... pickyOof
[0:24:53] <+Nothing_Wild> Is his friend the one playing?
[0:24:59] <wqorst> it's not the same if you've got double digit fps :(
[0:25:01] <+Amaideus> Just wait until he gets to the proper-ass scat party
[0:25:01] <leith_aziz> @Nothing_Wild Reggie you mean
[0:25:02] <available_line> Yes
[0:25:03] <+kevlarkoala> @Nothing_Wild Reggie, and yes he is
[0:25:04] <Arqartur0> @Arqartur0 *hugh* Brother!
[0:25:07] <emptyantics> !uptime
[0:25:08] <@Moobot> @emptyantics WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 32 minutes and 31 seconds
[0:25:17] <greatspaceadventure> @leith_aziz what do you mean by "being negative" exactly?? like, I CONSTANTLY shit on Nintendo, but it's because i generally love them so much
[0:25:19] <%doughvatkyn> breathe in deep, reggie
[0:25:32] <owensleftfoot> Does reggie have the repair box?
[0:25:32] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1457949040566575106?t=WRD3hhRxnZrnVQfqKaaqMA&s=19
[0:25:40] <%hax_metatron> KEEP MOVING
[0:25:49] <+ThePich> forget about your souls tbh
[0:25:49] <%vivaciouseff> @owensleftfoot i believe so
[0:25:50] <%hax_metatron> DONT STOP MOVING
[0:25:53] <+kevlarkoala> @Nothing_Wild Reggie is a mainstay, you'll get to know him well. he's a sweetheart!
[0:25:53] <didipackums1> Never turn back
[0:25:56] <andre11dr> @leith_aziz You just gotta learn to be a soulless asshole that doesn't give a shit about others opinions, like meeeee :)
[0:25:57] <greatspaceadventure> Never stop never stopping
[0:26:02] <leith_aziz> @Arqartur0 I find discussion streams comforting as well. That or positive analyses videos. A nice watch pickyCozy
[0:26:02] <%Mkingston> At least you have a stable frame rate. I first played this on an offline 360.
[0:26:07] <gryffinp> pantsleess man
[0:26:09] <%Indigo_Automaton> Keep an eye out for cans and unscratched lotto tickets
[0:26:10] <%CateHecate> Non Stop Infinite Blight
[0:26:12] <%Solidnick18> get the thing and be alert
[0:26:16] <%marrowslurp> Finally, time for some Melty action
[0:26:16] <xeros720> subtitles: "RIP"
[0:26:21] <user_naim> just do it
[0:26:25] <%patriotrenegade> Con-flu is unavoidable
[0:26:25] <%Bread_Assassin> Reggie should exchange Combustion for MAgic Weapon, imo.
[0:26:34] <%cobalt_phoenix_> BOY DID YOU
[0:26:40] <+RenoDeGeneric> Yo he got a Murakumo?
[0:26:47] <%doughvatkyn> where's pools?
[0:26:47] <+RenoDeGeneric> AND A CATCH POLE?
[0:27:00] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @RenoDeGeneric AND A BLACK KNIGHT SWORD
[0:27:03] <andre11dr> Wait shouldn't Reggie talk to Laurecius before doing this?
[0:27:04] <zhenthrim213> @RenoDeGeneric on his first one
[0:27:06] <%Lion_kun> 2 BKS
[0:27:07] <%CateHecate> damage is lower but only because its unupgraded
[0:27:07] <+RenoDeGeneric> BRUH
[0:27:12] <%Indigo_Automaton> Is it a catalyst?
[0:27:13] <owensleftfoot> I find it weird that it scales with intelligence rather than faith, since the titanite demon shoots lightning with it
[0:27:17] <%Solidnick18> he is a lucky boi
[0:27:18] <%patriotrenegade> TWO Black Knight Swords
[0:27:19] <Visorak6> I think the only rare drop he hasnt gotten is the BK UGS
[0:27:20] <+BananaSlammuh> @renodegeneric you’ve missed a lot of Streamer luck
[0:27:21] <+Shishi1205> he got a egg vermifugge too in the forest
[0:27:25] <xXVeggiePLusXx> Its a halberd
[0:27:31] <Treasure_Vault> @Visorak6 and a BK shield
[0:27:39] <emptyantics> Halberd chads wya!?
[0:27:40] <%X2Eliah> He traded the egg vermo
[0:27:41] <AbnormalVoid> should try some Zwei, just sayin :)
[0:27:44] <+Shishi1205> My dude has sus drops on some Dream type beat
[0:27:45] <%patriotrenegade> I beat the game my first time with the Catchpole
[0:27:46] <Treasure_Vault> Zwei is nice
[0:27:54] <%Indigo_Automaton> @emptyantics yo
[0:27:58] <gryffinp> I think the thing that makes this descent into BlightCon truly unique in the souls series is that every other game from now has and will have fast travel from and to everywhere from the start of the game
[0:28:04] <alroy909> halberds are bestberds
[0:28:05] <+TheOddJik> Ayyy finally caught this live
[0:28:09] <gryffinp> whereas right now Reggarth is fucking STUCK IN THIS MESS and has to GO DEEPER
[0:28:10] <%DegenCat> HOW DOES REGGIE HAVE TWO BLACK KNIGHT SWORDS
[0:28:12] <%DegenCat> I'M SO JELLY
[0:28:14] <%Lion_kun> Is the catchpole good?
[0:28:17] <andre11dr> Dose it upgrade with twinkling or demon titanite?
[0:28:18] <%patriotrenegade> Also I've noticed that I got the Baller Swag Sword on all the characters I wasn't speccing into DEX for
[0:28:27] <%Necnill> "Who are you cheating on me with, Reggie!"
[0:28:30] <nxflre> @DegenCat Blaack Knight at Burg and Asylum
[0:28:30] <AbnormalVoid> Gee Reggie, How Come You Get Two Black Knight Swords?
[0:28:38] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YOURE FRIENDS WITH WAKKA?
[0:28:38] <fruit_pie_the_magician> catchpole is fucking sick especially early game
[0:28:41] <%CateHecate> Lucky Reg
[0:28:43] <@Moobot> Please don't fill up the entire chat, @leith_aziz
[0:28:44] <+ALazo> introduce reggie to gacha games
[0:28:47] <owensleftfoot> "FUCK YOU!"-Pat, 2017
[0:28:52] <JetpackMcQuack> Game’s free now :(
[0:28:54] <Xaeveax> Yeah Pat loved it
[0:28:54] <%CateHecate> stabby stabby
[0:28:59] <NeoNeonNero> Lucky Piggy Knight Reggarth
[0:29:19] <AbnormalVoid> :(
[0:29:20] <%CateHecate> pig head plus elite knight plus catchpole is the most Vidya Garms look you can have LUL
[0:29:26] <waltzqueen> @JetpackMcQuack dark souls is free? or are you saying theres no challenge
[0:29:28] <+Shishi1205> fun fact last time I played I tried to save scum to get the halberd and I got it first try lmao
[0:29:29] <andre11dr> Reggie just LOVES his piggy helm
[0:29:33] <JetpackMcQuack> naw, i'm joking
[0:29:33] <slix3431> Day 2 of Blightcon 2021
[0:29:34] <+Shishi1205> in the forest too
[0:29:36] <%Prevot> oh man Reggie is going full Ganon
[0:29:38] <+ds3namecaldara> through the show room and artists alley
[0:29:41] <AbnormalVoid> no big smashy :(
[0:29:43] <%X2Eliah> Pork Souls all day
[0:29:46] <andre11dr> He would be fast rolling without it too LUL
[0:29:46] <%Prevot> he's gonna be weilding a trident now
[0:29:48] <chainsaw105> and so, last we left off, Reggarth reached his first checkpoint: the BlightCon bathrooms, where he's currently kickin' it with the Melty Blood players
[0:29:54] <Treasure_Vault> Target shield is good for parries
[0:29:58] <greatspaceadventure> they always talk about Dark Souls, but where the heck is Light Bodies?
[0:29:58] <Gmanblack> @shishi1205 I tried to save scum for a Black Knight Greatsword and got it first try aswell LUL
[0:29:59] <nailwind> phew made it to the stream

[0:31:04] <andre11dr> So what would Queelag represent in Blightcon? is she that one cosplayer selling her toothbrush?
[0:31:06] <waltzqueen> @CateHecate they ARE the security

[0:32:24] <%Lion_kun> It somehow invariably comes back to the toothpick haha

[0:42:55] <DSD24> Melty looking better at least
[0:42:56] <%CateHecate> wait did he just fall????
[0:43:01] <+eanscrale> Thee kitchen staff has been very adamant about not wasting food, so nothing is thrown out. In fact who know how old it is!
[0:43:03] <Bedllama> That's the secret: it's all bathroom.
[0:43:04] <Puhff> Here at Blightcon, we shit where we eat!
[0:43:04] <%hiswill98> HE FELL
[0:43:05] <agustorm123> All the con is the bathroom tho

[0:43:57] <%CateHecate> that's the panel
[0:43:59] <xxHungryxx> Reggie showing no mercy with his pole chat 😏
[0:44:01] <%Indigo_Automaton> I think it does even better if he hits with the optimal reach of the weapon
[0:44:04] <%Vigonept> oh yo hes using yhe pole
[0:44:07] <%shakespearo> reggie noticed the blight con melty blood setup

[0:54:42] <+blink289> has woolie considered the dung pie
[0:54:42] <peachy996> I love how Miyazaki apologized for Lost Izalith but this? No Apologies, perfectly fine.
[0:54:43] <%Seancicle> wie gehts 👌🏻
[0:54:45] <%CommanderSqueaks> With nothing to lose, there's everything to gain
[0:54:51] <%Solidnick18> just get the thing if you can
[0:54:52] <JetpackMcQuack> take something with you LUL
[0:54:54] <%Nested_Dreams> Nested_Dreams subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! woolieKICKDAD woolieGLORY
[0:54:54] <%DegenCat> @Estuko hey whatever floats your boat
[0:54:55] <+Amaideus> This is infinitely more designed than Izalith
[0:54:56] <peachy996> Old performance issues aside
[0:55:00] <owensleftfoot> NAH SON
[0:55:00] <%X2Eliah> why
[0:55:00] <+tsamxxx> you thought
[0:55:01] <Klefth> ...FIREBALLS?
[0:55:01] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL LUL
[0:55:02] <AbnormalVoid> play smart, not hard
[0:55:02] <%cobalt_phoenix_> reggie why
[0:55:02] <%CommanderSqueaks> @peachy996 Lost Izalith was bad by mistake, this was totally intentional
[0:55:03] <LordlayerO> off
[0:55:03] <Darren716> Blight town as at least fair
[0:55:04] <%X2Eliah> WHY
[0:55:05] <gryffinp> It's not called "prepare to die" edition because its supposed to be hard and you're supposed to not die, its to emphasize that you must learn to embrace death.
[0:55:07] <+Jiggisnipe> oh you thought
[0:55:08] <%Solidnick18> damn it
[0:55:08] <+TheFrancix> FIREBALLLS
[0:55:08] <waltzqueen> ! DIGNITY BROKEN !
[0:55:11] <Puhff> MY DUDE
[0:55:13] <warpiscute> he turned around last second and got counter hit
[0:55:16] <Nogopharo> Dont get hit
[0:55:16] <+Jiggisnipe> Reggie just use your pyro or magic lol
[0:55:17] <SoaringTrumpet> don't think
[0:55:19] <QueequegTheater> @peachy996 Because LI is fucking boring, this at least has some thuggery
[0:55:19] <xxHungryxx> the sigh lmso
[0:55:23] <%IronOhki> @patriotrenegade I once met a fellow at a con, bit of a chonky fellow, what you'd expect. But this class act went around asking pretty ladies to hover-hand him for a picture. This boy had game and I respect him.
[0:55:24] <+eanscrale> If only you had some way to attack from afar...
[0:55:24] <xxHungryxx> lmao*
[0:55:24] <%X2Eliah> i do not understand
[0:55:27] <ashenjuan25> Oh shit
[0:55:30] <striderzer0> Ryu would be disappointed
[0:55:31] <iacus_> I never understood why people hated lost izalith so much?
[0:55:32] <Estuko> So question question, that big monster I killed from a distance, is it really brutal up close and trusting my instincts was right all these years?
[0:55:34] <Treasure_Vault> He's instakilled reggie thrice. Maybe don't get close.
[0:55:35] <ashenjuan25> We in madden town already?
[0:55:38] <%CateHecate> Blighttown tournaments have serious problems with thuggery
[0:55:39] <peachy996> @QueequegTheater OH MAN is there Thuggery
[0:55:40] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Estuko yes
[0:55:42] <DSD24> @Estuko Yes
[0:55:42] <agustorm123> 5 death so far?
[0:55:43] <+ThePich> DIG UP
[0:55:49] <peachy996> It's everywhere in this level
[0:55:52] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[0:55:55] <peachy996> Top to bottom
[0:55:55] <JetpackMcQuack> nice
[0:55:56] <%trigunstar26> I just took it down with arrows
[0:55:56] <+Brightstreak> I'm legitimately happy that Reggie is able to play blighttown with framerate.  FPS is a superpower
[0:55:57] <%Solidnick18> wtf was that
[0:55:58] <AbnormalVoid> surprise buttsexs
[0:55:59] <Puhff> Levels pyro and sorc, still unga bunga
[0:56:04] <%CommanderSqueaks> Blightcon hasn't gotten the memo on glomping, it seems
[0:56:07] <Treasure_Vault> Every time he dies, he wakes up on the first day of blightcon. It's like groundhogs day.
[0:56:08] <%patriotrenegade> yeah they grab through shields
[0:56:10] <Puhff> smh my head
[0:56:12] <owensleftfoot> break line of sight
[0:56:20] <+Bitscreed> @Treasure_Vault Blightloop
[0:56:21] <gryffinp> You know, you just need to find a place where they can't hit you! just like with the Taurus Demon!
[0:56:24] <%CommanderSqueaks> When has a shield EVER in any game stopped a grab?
[0:56:25] <bobxmaker> but hey, blight town is worth it when we get to the end of it Kappa
[0:56:27] <Estuko> I still remember the first glomp at the first con I went to, never again.
[0:56:45] <Xaeveax> The yeeter did the yeeting
[0:56:52] <owensleftfoot> People don't believe in social distancing here
[0:56:53] <%trigunstar26> It’s literally just a hug right?
[0:57:00] <waltzqueen> @Estuko big same. i still feel the shame
[0:57:00] <agustorm123> Blight con is tough this year
[0:57:01] <warpiscute> get this man back on the claymore
[0:57:05] <Estuko> @trigunstar26 a full body lunging hug.
[0:57:06] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Estuko That and the paddles. A lot of people got stupid for a while.
[0:57:12] <%CateHecate> the yeeter must awaken
[0:57:22] <SarcFa> @warpiscute claymore was doing worse damage my man
[0:57:23] <peachy996> Ballsy
[0:57:25] <waltzqueen> @CommanderSqueaks banning them was the best thing cons ever did
[0:57:25] <AbnormalVoid> LUL
[0:57:26] <%CateHecate> AW YEAH
[0:57:26] <owensleftfoot> YEYEYEYE
[0:57:27] <%tank7013> Nice
[0:57:31] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[0:57:33] <%IronOhki> @Estuko What's really uncomfortable is when a con starts small, and you know everyone there and are on hugging terms, but a few years later it grows and new folk think it's a hug con. Discomfort go up.
[0:57:36] <%CateHecate> [QA AURA]
[0:57:39] <agustorm123> Yeye
[0:57:43] <andre11dr> You know, as bad as Blighttown is ,at least it's unique and memorable and it has some cool enemies....as opposed to The Guter witch it wack in every way possible
[0:57:44] <Estuko> @waltzqueen shame + bloody nose because the person was not only heavier than me but he did the full arm wrap around causing me to hit the floor hard. Sucks.
[0:57:47] <AbnormalVoid> rekt

[0:58:07] <%IronOhki> BRITNEY
[0:58:23] <waltzqueen> @Estuko OOF, even during my first con with glomping there was an ettiquite where we got permission first
[0:58:25] <%CateHecate> listen for the goop sounds
[0:58:34] <DSD24> @glass_marcus If I was a enemy I would make sure I dropped the wrong item, out of spite
[0:58:41] <greatspaceadventure> oh nice, i love Bubblegloop Swamp!
[0:58:42] <waltzqueen> GOO ASMR

[0:59:27] <+Amaideus> It actually can't hit you from this end, lol
[0:59:28] <+SuperFightinRobot> Is it just me, or are the levels more of an obstacle than the bosses in ds1?
[0:59:28] <SheefEatsBeef> its above
[0:59:30] <tozs_> Kappa
[0:59:33] <andre11dr> It can't attack him btw LUL

[0:59:39] <MeImoth> lifebar for this is just way too high
[0:59:44] <owensleftfoot> Give them a break, there's no toilets at Blightcon
[0:59:45] <chainsaw105> "Y'all just let the doodoo fall in the toilet?"
[0:59:50] <+Amaideus> @SuperFightinRobot Yup, that's how it usually is pre DS3
[0:59:50] <NeoNeonNero> @andre11dr u sure about that

[0:59:55] <%CommanderSqueaks> Cheer500 Blightcon is actually a purgatory where all shitty con goers get sent to. It's like The Hunter's Nightmare for weebs. That's why everyone's trying to glomp you.

[1:00:14] <AbnormalVoid> LUL
[1:00:14] <+Jiggisnipe> Time to get STRONG
[1:00:15] <MeImoth> and now for one of my favorite spells in the game, because I am shit at using RTSR
[1:00:16] <Treasure_Vault> the greatest spell in the series, maybe
[1:00:17] <KeiganOfAstora> Reggie is too pure
[1:00:17] <%hax_metatron> The "I'M A CHAD" spell
[1:00:18] <velgaduere> KAIO KEN TIMES TEN
[1:00:19] <gryffinp> the only actual reason to go through blightcon proper instead of skipping to the bottom
[1:00:24] <Darren716> Reggie remember when you asked about setting yourself on fire?
[1:00:26] <+SuperFightinRobot> @Amaideus Ah, fair. I have only ever beaten ds3 and bloodborne, but I am going through ds1 atm
[1:00:28] <peachy996> Are you ever really safe?
[1:00:30] <%Dakuu75> Lol
[1:00:42] <Raldavar> Original power within, not that knock off version in DS3
[1:00:42] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[1:00:47] <DSD24> Its so cool
[1:00:48] <%Prevot> literally kaioken
[1:00:49] <glass_marcus> Kaioken
[1:00:51] <peanutdot007> THE EIGHT INNER GATES
[1:00:51] <@Solidus_113> 100 seconds of kaioken
[1:00:52] <%Nested_Dreams> become your flamesona
[1:00:53] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @owensleftfoot
[1:00:58] <Dannzzyy> Og players remember how crazy good power within was.
[1:00:59] <leith_aziz> pickyHype pickyAngy pickyHype
[1:01:00] <%CateHecate> 8th Gate Bankai
[1:01:00] <andre11dr> One of the best spells, hands down
[1:01:03] <%Josef_Stryker> Kaio what?
[1:01:03] <ohno778> Reinforcement
[1:01:05] <+Amaideus> It's straight up extra 40% damage AND way better stamina regen
[1:01:06] <+JustToWatch> KAIO WHAT?
[1:01:06] <JetpackMcQuack> make it count
[1:01:08] <+liquidzr0> khalil7Smug
[1:01:09] <MeImoth> 1% HP per sec for 100sec, but 30% damage boost and stamina regen boost
[1:01:13] <agustorm123> Ohh right
[1:01:14] <Monkeyweed21> GATE OF LIFE OPEN
[1:01:15] <Awesome_Leaf> dont yell chat LUL
[1:01:16] <Kalinflip> the powerrr withinnnnnnnnn
[1:01:20] <velgaduere> pyromancy is fire AND life magic
[1:01:21] <leith_aziz> Kaio-crap!
[1:01:23] <AbnormalVoid> Shoot Fire, Become Steel, Sweat A Lot
[1:01:27] <%CommanderSqueaks> Open up the fucking gates
[1:01:27] <Omentus> but you lose HP
[1:01:28] <+TheFrancix> ROCK LEE TIME
[1:01:29] <Garboh> Power within is cracked
[1:01:32] <+Inferno_Icon> Kaioken or 9 inner gates
[1:01:35] <+Amaideus> Ever wanted to hit for 600 damage per R1?
[1:01:36] <QueequegTheater> IT EVEN HAS A RED AURA
[1:01:37] <andre11dr> It's a like 45% increase in damage
[1:01:39] <Treasure_Vault> You lose hp, but they lose more hp.
[1:01:40] <waltzqueen> BECOME MIGHT GUY
[1:01:41] <owensleftfoot> no you need to attune it
[1:01:42] <+Amaideus> On a medium speed weapon?
[1:01:42] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Awesome_Leaf do you know where we are?
[1:01:49] <+Shishi1205> 8th gate
[1:01:52] <+Amaideus> Because that's how you hit for 600+ damage per hit
[1:01:56] <+eanscrale> Pair it with the Red Tearstone ring if you're feeling extra spicy.
[1:02:02] <user_naim> Pyromancers bullshitting like Jojo characters
[1:02:03] <owensleftfoot> probably the best spell in the game for bosses
[1:02:03] <QueequegTheater> It's like a 40% increase to both raw damage and stamina regen
[1:02:04] <%CommanderSqueaks> But when you use it, you gotta GO IN
[1:02:05] <zhenthrim213> open the gates
[1:02:06] <AbnormalVoid> damn it feels good to be a pyro
[1:02:07] <QueequegTheater> It's absurd
[1:02:11] <GoldenKaos> Ganbare Reggie
[1:02:12] <warpiscute> someone with a turtling playstyle is not gonna get much use out of it
[1:02:21] <%hax_metatron> You're done
[1:02:22] <+CateHecate> Pyromantic Roid Rage
[1:02:23] <+Shishi1205> bro imagine lifesteal with that
[1:02:25] <%hax_metatron> You can just go to lower Blighttown now
[1:02:27] <gryffinp> it was probably a mistake for pyromancy to require literally no soul level investment but its also awesome
[1:02:28] <DSD24> Cazadors
[1:02:31] <%hax_metatron> You got everything up there Regige
[1:02:34] <peachy996> Aw yeah

[1:02:41] <%CateHecate> houston mf's be like "chill bruh the mosquito aint even that big"
[1:02:43] <andre11dr> AND if Reggie keeps at it with magic, he gets to stack Power Within and Crystal Magic Weapon, and MEEEEELT BOSSES
[1:02:43] <peachy996> Now this starts
[1:02:46] <%Supermonaman> I just got here what did I miss?
[1:02:50] <%tank7013> The reason that blighttown runs so poorly
[1:02:50] <Reckless_Rob> I cant see captain LUL
[1:02:54] <gryffinp> reggie found power within
[1:03:06] <gryffinp> !Guard Broken!
[1:03:08] <fruit_pie_the_magician> that r1 is probably almost the best thing in the game to kill those bugs

[1:19:55] <%trigunstar26> he wandered past the bonfire! NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[1:19:56] <hazeprojekt> welcome to the blightcon bathroom troth please wipe feet before entering
[1:19:58] <%CommanderSqueaks> Looks like Reggie reached the Melty Blood tournament LUL
[1:19:58] <user_naim> Nah don’t tell him
[1:20:00] <WeepProphet> welcome to blightcon
[1:20:00] <agustorm123> Woolie is on purpose withdrawing info I like it LUL
[1:20:03] <andre11dr> POWER WITHIN
[1:20:08] <%Ensign_Epic> sup trigun
[1:20:10] <gryffinp> time for a debriefing I guess
[1:20:14] <user_naim> let him figure out himself
[1:20:15] <nxflre> locked onto an iteem lol
[1:20:23] <MeImoth> I don't think he missed anything really important
[1:20:24] <BobbsonDugnutt> @Lion_kun Has Reggie been to the Catacombs to get that ability?
[1:20:34] <agustorm123> Let him take the choices
[1:20:43] <Call_for_Adventure> Woolie saying a bunch of shit that makes sense to someone that beat the game before
[1:20:46] <+Amaideus> @BobbsonDugnutt That lets you do it extra times
[1:20:46] <nxflre> @BobbsonDugnutt you caan kindle once without it
[1:20:50] <GeoffGeofreed> why is thd video skipping frames
[1:20:59] <%hiswill98> You could upgrade the catch pole too
[1:21:01] <DSD24> So cool
[1:21:02] <thelivingglitch307> *whispers*thepowerwithin
[1:21:04] <%fetrigon> Reggie tunnel vision never ceases to amaze LUL
[1:21:06] <BobbsonDugnutt> Oh, word?
[1:21:12] <Estuko> the power within
[1:21:12] <%cobalt_phoenix_> no
[1:21:14] <bobxmaker> breathe, think, reflect and adjust and breathe again to brace for another run
[1:21:16] <DSD24> Look at that Rage Aura
[1:21:18] <subjectg> it lasts for 100 seconds
[1:21:21] <gryffinp> danger strats
[1:21:29] <%hax_metatron> YUP NOW YOU'RE DARK SOULSING
[1:21:29] <MeImoth> 100sec
[1:21:30] <%cobalt_phoenix_> 100
[1:21:31] <%CommanderSqueaks> 100 seconds
[1:21:34] <%hiswill98> You can upgrade the catch pole too
[1:21:39] <AbnormalVoid> it sacrifices almost all of your health
[1:21:41] <+megaman_sentinel> !uptime
[1:21:41] <@Moobot> @megaman_sentinel WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 29 minutes
[1:21:45] <LunarRemix> 100 seconds at 1% per second
[1:21:46] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1457949040566575106?t=WRD3hhRxnZrnVQfqKaaqMA&s=19
[1:21:46] <AbnormalVoid> it won't kill you as long as you don't take damage
[1:21:50] <striderzer0> dart throwers are gone?
[1:21:50] <agustorm123> KAIOH KEN
[1:21:51] <subjectg> I appreciate Remastest changing it to 20s because that’s too much
[1:21:56] <QueequegTheater> It will kill you if you take any damage
[1:21:58] <andre11dr> Yep ,that dose work
[1:22:20] <gryffinp> its like being posioned! Except voluntarily!
[1:22:31] <+Amaideus> He kills them in half the number of hits
[1:22:32] <+Shishi1205> kinda
[1:22:32] <+mattiabh> power within in this game is such a good % damage boost
[1:22:34] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus This is a FANTASTIC buff. It lasts for about 90 seconds, gives a 40% buff to ALL damage you deal, increases your stamina regeneration speed by 75%, and you can extend its duration by wearing the Lingering Dragoncrest Ring.
[1:22:36] <agustorm123> HE ULTRA INSTINT
[1:22:36] <AbnormalVoid> has the Catch Pole been upgraded at all, yet?
[1:22:38] <+Amaideus> PW stronk
[1:22:39] <Treasure_Vault> Might be worth kindling for strength within. I think you can kindle every bonfire if you're not going human often.
[1:22:40] <+xyxlzyzm> it's like if poison made you hit like a truck
[1:22:43] <%hax_metatron> He doesn't really have to, he got all the important items IMO in Upper Blighttown. Everything else is a Soul
[1:22:55] <%Ensign_Epic> Power Within is probably not a solid idea for Reggie at this point, IMO
[1:22:59] <andre11dr> @abnormalvoid NOPE
[1:23:07] <QueequegTheater> noooo
[1:23:08] <AbnormalVoid> whyyyy
[1:23:10] <subjectg> the only thing reggie may have missed is the iaido, but he’s not using dex
[1:23:11] <%Ensign_Epic> Maybe when he's stuck at a boss who he's not DPSing enough
[1:23:12] <Kalinflip> IMO
[1:23:24] <Kalinflip> 4Head
[1:23:24] <%Ensign_Epic> @subjectg He jumped to it last session
[1:23:28] <AbnormalVoid> please upgrade pole lmao
[1:23:30] <+Shishi1205> he got
[1:23:30] <subjectg> oh cool
[1:23:53] <+Shishi1205> he needs 2k to upgrade
[1:23:55] <bobxmaker> power within is probably gonna be pivotal in new londo
[1:23:55] <+twohitgood> whoa catchpole? Reggie keeps getting those rare drops.
[1:23:57] <%cobalt_phoenix_> LUL
[1:23:58] <%patriotrenegade> @WoolieVersus I know theres the shield Patches uses on one of the buttresses
[1:23:58] <MeImoth> He has the Iaito and Power Within,  only other kinda intersting thing might be the Eagle Tower Shield, if  he hasn't gotten it
[1:24:02] <%Quasimofo> @AbnormalVoid He's testing to see if he even likes it
[1:24:08] <agustorm123> He had like 6k when he died
[1:24:12] <+Shishi1205> he has the eagle
[1:24:16] <CrowbarFacelift> Did he get the Shadow Set?
[1:24:19] <+xyxlzyzm> @MeImoth he has
[1:24:22] <Johannen> @patriotrenegade already got that one
[1:24:24] <AbnormalVoid> He'll like it more if it actually does damage lmao
[1:24:28] <+Shishi1205> he has wanderer and shadow
[1:24:36] <%patriotrenegade> then theres nothing really left except soul items
[1:24:37] <CrowbarFacelift> @Shishi1205 thanks
[1:24:43] <agustorm123> Poor dogos
[1:24:43] <slix3431> Nice dodge
[1:24:49] <gryffinp> whoever told reggie to un-lock on did him a huge disservice
[1:24:51] <AbnormalVoid> it fits the aesthetic
[1:24:53] <dundore77> can you shield and poke with it?
[1:24:59] <+Shishi1205> no
[1:25:03] <+Shishi1205> Its a halberd
[1:25:04] <%CateHecate> its a halberd type
[1:25:09] <+Amaideus> I think that's spears and rapiers only in DS1
[1:25:19] <nxflre> we tried chat
[1:25:24] <DSD24> Check those corners
[1:25:28] <%trigunstar26> upgraded elite knight armor is best chest for this area
[1:25:28] <user_naim> All in all, this is fine. We’re doing great
[1:25:32] <subjectg> Too bad the catch pole doesn’t have the spin2win, that attack rocks
[1:25:41] <%cobalt_phoenix_> wait i just realized that's a person it swings
[1:25:43] <+Shishi1205> is the spider weak to mg?
[1:25:43] <bobxmaker> i wonder if reggie understands how much damage he's taking using a heavier armor in contrast with a lighter armor
[1:26:00] <+Shishi1205> huh?
[1:26:07] <+Shishi1205> janky ass grabbox
[1:26:08] <%CateHecate> chip
[1:26:26] <%mr_sups> That's Ibuki's SA in 3rd Strike
[1:26:39] <mental_mashup> Ds1 enemies got the melty blood hitboxes
[1:26:40] <%mr_sups> The Puffball
[1:26:42] <user_naim> I-no’s super?
[1:26:43] <%hax_metatron> It's a Soul item guys don'
[1:26:48] <user_naim> kind of
[1:26:54] <@Menitta> Aw hell nah Skodword got the jankbox
[1:27:01] <%hax_metatron> It was just a Soul item and you get to it from behind the bonfire
[1:27:16] <Sonny_Firestorm> Did you guys gaslit reggie into embracing the pain yet?
[1:27:18] <Onionknight47> @WoolieVersus congratulations on the wedding dude! (I'm like... months late I know)
[1:27:30] <moonmintparadise> So, why are they not kindling their bonfire?
[1:27:36] <Mimpyflip> oh god its blight town
[1:27:48] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @moonmintparadise don't really need to at this point
[1:27:49] <Sonny_Firestorm> more like gaslight town KEKW
[1:27:57] <+Shishi1205> @moonmintparadise he has a traumatic experience with kindling
[1:27:57] <mental_mashup> reggie knows no fear, trusting plunging attacks in blighttown
[1:28:05] <agustorm123> Gaslight town LUL
[1:28:18] <nxflre> pretty sure the iteem is humaanity
[1:28:28] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Gaslight Gatekeep Blighttown
[1:28:29] <+ThePich> Girlboss Town
[1:28:37] <moonmintparadise> well, by the time he reached the swamp he died because he ran out of estus.. idk if you would call that not needed..
[1:28:48] <Monkeyweed21> its just a consumable
[1:28:48] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:28:52] <Mimpyflip> is venom in this game the worst?
[1:28:58] <Mimpyflip> or !toxic!
[1:29:00] <%hax_metatron> From behind where you spawn at the bonfire
[1:29:01] <user_naim> @moonmintparadise yeah but it’s funny when he dies
[1:29:06] <trigunstar26> toxic sucks
[1:29:08] <moonmintparadise> @user_naim true...
[1:29:18] <haitakaa> I hope he gets the iaoto
[1:29:20] <nxflre> eeither souls or humanity i think
[1:29:28] <glass_marcus> @haitakaa already did
[1:29:29] <LunarRemix> He's already got it
[1:29:29] <+Shishi1205> @haitakaa he has it
[1:29:32] <nxflre> @haitakaa hee got it laast sesh
[1:29:32] <haitakaa> oh nice
[1:29:34] <+Jiggisnipe> @haitakaa he did but doesn't have the dex I think
[1:29:34] <andre11dr> Isn't it just a soul or something
[1:29:35] <bobxmaker> the fun part of blight town is that it's kind of a maze and ot
[1:29:40] <bobxmaker> it's easy to get lost
[1:29:40] <%hax_metatron> Yup from behind the bonfire
[1:29:41] <+Shishi1205> If one thing reggie has is weapons
[1:29:41] <%hax_metatron> Keep going
[1:29:55] <agustorm123> There are good items but you already pick them
[1:29:58] <+セビー> so i was thinking, he was salty over kindling in asylum, but having more sips can give confidence against tough bosses
[1:29:58] <+extradopeness> did he get the fire keeper soul?
[1:29:59] <%trigunstar26> but he was right there. he didn't have to keep going if he stopped to look around
[1:30:04] <%vVAstrAVv> watch it be a lost soul
[1:30:08] <%hax_metatron> There we go
[1:30:17] <+swesterly> No drop look closer
[1:30:31] <%CateHecate> reggie dropshot that guy like artorias
[1:30:31] <andre11dr> You don't need to drop
[1:30:32] <BobbsonDugnutt> DS1 fall damage Kreygasm
[1:30:34] <%trigunstar26> he's def going to want to kindle in the swamp
[1:30:37] <SailorJagen> what dark area is worse here or the one in dark souls 2 where you have to light your own way
[1:30:44] <haitakaa> did Woolie get access to the Elden Ring network test?
[1:30:48] <JetpackMcQuack> lookin like a regular
[1:30:49] <agustorm123> Hope is something good
[1:30:51] <%hax_metatron> You can get to it from below
[1:30:59] <Estuko> @SailorJagen dark area? tomb of giants imo.
[1:31:03] <andre11dr> @sailorjagen Valley of Defilement
[1:31:04] <+セビー> tomb of giants is the worst of all dark zones
[1:31:11] <user_naim> @sailorjagen the ds2 poison pit wall worms
[1:31:12] <+Jiggisnipe> @haitakaa he said he didn't
[1:31:25] <+Shishi1205> bro fuck those poise stronk skelies
[1:31:36] <agustorm123> Just look the bloodstain
[1:31:38] <Call_for_Adventure> So worth it
[1:31:39] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ayyy
[1:31:40] <nxflre> humanity
[1:31:40] <gryffinp> one rat
[1:31:50] <%DashXero> Was that worth it?
[1:31:51] <haitakaa> I don't think I've ever done the Tomb without just running through and skipping everything LUL
[1:31:55] <%cobalt_phoenix_> now off to the swamp
[1:31:55] <+Shishi1205> zone done
[1:31:55] <critfumble_> rats rats we are the rats
[1:31:57] <agustorm123> LUL
[1:32:03] <%Juriasu> mind goblins say it was worth
[1:32:03] <%Lion_kun> He could kindle the bonfire with it
[1:32:05] <AbnormalVoid> could go for the Iaito, too Kappa
[1:32:05] <JetpackMcQuack> but the goblins
[1:32:06] <%hax_metatron> This is why Eagle shield / Power within are the only important items in Upper Blighttown
[1:32:13] <+セビー> finding silver serpent drop off in tomb bites
[1:32:15] <Lunalios> did they get here from drake valley or the depths?
[1:32:16] <nxflre> Does Reggie know about kindling?
[1:32:18] <%DashXero> Rats are anatomically like little humans with tails.
[1:32:18] <Estuko> Oh my god.
[1:32:18] <agustorm123> The goblins like bright things
[1:32:19] <AbnormalVoid> Shufflin' Shufflin'
[1:32:21] <%Lion_kun> He got the Iato
[1:32:25] <+Jiggisnipe> @AbnormalVoid got it last sesh
[1:32:27] <+twohitgood> schmovin through those bridges
[1:32:29] <AbnormalVoid> oh riiiiight
[1:32:29] <bobxmaker> reggie is trucking along well
[1:32:31] <AbnormalVoid> forgot
[1:32:35] <+Shishi1205> @haitakaa there's like a white titanite slab and some great divine embers but not much more. Only good thing is killing leroy
[1:32:41] <Qsmash_> its jank
[1:32:41] <%CateHecate> kindle and upgrade pole?
[1:32:43] <DSD24> Where's Sherlock when you need him
[1:32:44] <+Jiggisnipe> maybe he should kindle this bonfire
[1:32:49] <thelivingglitch307> we like to dance GoblinPls
[1:32:59] <+Jiggisnipe> well give the run to the swamp one more time
[1:33:04] <%CateHecate> chariot tackle
[1:33:11] <+balkonas1> No point in kindling this one
[1:33:12] <agustorm123> Kindle tho
[1:33:12] <+Shishi1205> @WoolieVersus he has enough souls to upgrade the pole
[1:33:19] <+Shishi1205> If he wants to anyways
[1:33:19] <+extradopeness> still laughing at reggies questioning if there would be platform sequences
[1:33:21] <velgaduere> oh jesus
[1:33:22] <%vVAstrAVv> i dont think it was nagging HIM woolie lol
[1:33:23] <%scrumbotime> oh no
[1:33:23] <+Jiggisnipe> *Gets Glomped*
[1:33:23] <velgaduere> LUL
[1:33:24] <andre11dr> It's still pretty crazy that he's doing Blighttown with a 0 weapon when he has a +5 one
[1:33:24] <SoaringTrumpet> lol
[1:33:24] <%hax_metatron> FREE BRITNEY
[1:33:25] <waltzqueen> OOF

[1:33:26] <CrowbarFacelift> LUL
[1:33:26] <velgaduere> WOOLIE NO
[1:33:31] <slix3431> Nice targeting Reg
[1:33:33] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[1:33:50] <+Shishi1205> upgrading your weapon would let you kill em faster
[1:33:54] <+Amaideus> Catchpole has really high base damage
[1:34:10] <+Amaideus> And its upgrade path is much faster than "standard" weapons

[1:34:15] <+Shishi1205> I've actually never seen a first try ds1 playtrough of str and int
[1:34:19] <%CateHecate> the small amount of damage it has less than the claymore is made up with by the magic damage on it and it is also way faster

[1:37:31] <+Bitscreed> Blightcon main floor
[1:37:32] <%CateHecate> we finally made it to the con floor
[1:37:33] <%hax_metatron> You get that item from the other side
[1:37:33] <bobxmaker> the funny thing is that catch pole is pretty ideal considering the stats reggie is rocking
[1:37:40] <DSD24> @andre11dr That's how blightcon works
[1:37:49] <agustorm123> NotLikeThis
[1:37:56] <%CateHecate> youve iced almost all of the toxic fuckers
[1:38:00] <%Lion_kun> I do not get why that pole scales with int
[1:38:08] <%Lion_kun> It's super weird.
[1:38:15] <%CateHecate> mucky muck
[1:38:23] <%cisealnine> Ah, I have arrived just in time for Blightcon! Lordrons formost convention in goop.

[1:38:32] <subjectg> you have to be smart to hit people with those points @lion_kun
[1:38:35] <DSD24> You need to be smart to use it effectively? @Lion_kun maybe?
[1:38:36] <+OutOfJambread> The Goop is here HeyGuys
[1:38:37] <fruit_pie_the_magician> it couldn't possibly be because it's made from giant magic titanite monsters
[1:38:38] <+ReallyBigRocks> Ms. Paltrow you need to LEAVE
[1:38:41] <%Juriasu> the ring will allow you to walk right through Gwyneth unhindered
[1:38:42] <haitakaa> tony stark turned pepper into goop

[1:38:51] <%CateHecate> BALLSY
[1:38:54] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> guess that works
[1:38:55] <Klefth> Combustion would be pretty good for that too
[1:38:56] <+Rasheedt> KomodoHype
[1:38:58] <%Lion_kun> It should scale with faith.
[1:38:59] <+Malysitos> Ah, the dreaded mosquitoes
[1:39:02] <%hax_metatron> You got enough poise Reggie
[1:39:04] <DSD24> Nah man that's not overkill
[1:39:05] <peachy996> Yes that works against Mosquitos, politely requesting them to leave
[1:39:12] <ronin19xx> They respawn infinitely no?
[1:39:13] <nxflre> just replace wolf ring for now
[1:39:16] <%trigunstar26> yeah combustion is awesome for those
[1:39:26] <subjectg> @lion_kun you have to be really, really smart to understand why that is and use the catchpole
[1:39:26] <+Malysitos> Sometimes you need to bring a sledge hammer to kill a fly
[1:39:31] <%Dakuu75> Just like teal mosquito s annoying as shit
[1:39:31] <geassguy360> Havel + FAP = Speeeeeeeeeeeeed
[1:39:32] <DSD24> That's the FAP ring to me
[1:39:37] <+Shishi1205> and then you get fap and you have no slots
[1:39:39] <Klefth> And then you get FAP and you no longer have ring slots
[1:39:39] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> that's the FAP slot Kappa
[1:39:40] <%Juriasu> then you get fap and you have 0 rignt slots
[1:39:45] <DSD24> Because it has STAMINA HEALTH ENDURANCE
[1:39:52] <available_line> Havel and FAP ring, yeah
[1:39:53] <+Shishi1205> ALL U NEED
[1:39:53] <andre11dr> That's the FAP slut

[1:40:13] <LoreKeeper_Thal> @andre11dr the what what now my dude? Kappa
[1:40:18] <geassguy360> the ol Havel+Fap
[1:40:24] <subjectg> Havel’s is the more superfluous ring since you can just take shit off
[1:40:25] <+Shishi1205> @alphonseisbest big str guys near you
[1:40:33] <DSD24> @LoreKeeper_Thal Ring of Favor and Protection
[1:40:34] <shieldanvil> fap ring + armorless run means you get your havel slot back
[1:40:38] <GeoGio3> mosquitoes ever present in the con
[1:40:39] <available_line> Right, you can't even take off DS1 FAP

[1:44:40] <QueequegTheater> Each jump is like 10% more damage
[1:44:45] <youngking_kush> Only goes to +5
[1:44:46] <AbnormalVoid> Twinkling is EASY to farm

[1:44:55] <QueequegTheater> Why save it
[1:45:02] <%CateHecate> big pole big boys

[1:46:38] <%CateHecate> the motto of souls combat always has been, if you can get the big animation out, you deserve the big damage

[1:51:39] <andre11dr> Shit, it's hard to invade Reggie, i keep getting other people
[1:51:41] <%CateHecate> now tayne i can get into

[1:52:15] <QueequegTheater> Woolie is giving us a chance here lmao
[1:52:18] <Omentus> not summoning?
[1:52:19] <JetpackMcQuack> he might just be farming
[1:52:28] <Softekan> Description doesn't say, but Butcher Knife heals on hit iirc
[1:52:29] <+extradopeness> Demon Hammer tho
[1:52:34] <Visorak6> 20 str baybee
[1:52:37] <%sewermonk> bump that int bro
[1:52:41] <%CateHecate> round numbers gachiBASS
[1:52:45] <agustorm123> We smart
[1:53:08] <%CateHecate> it's a living
[1:53:10] <+Awkward_Cyborg> ninja armor is one of the best
[1:53:13] <youngking_kush> Actually it's useLESS cuz you're gonna get poisoned anyway
[1:53:17] <+Jiggisnipe> different gear for different situations
[1:53:19] <+Shishi1205> spongebob hiker burning image meme
[1:53:23] <andre11dr> I still can't believe he switched PI for GSA
[1:53:25] <youngking_kush> Resistance just makes the bar longer
[1:53:25] <%Bread_Assassin> Woolie should really direct Reggie to Rickert for a magic infusion.
[1:53:29] <+cdrom321> On the contrary, you're not going to be able to avoid getting poisoned.
[1:53:30] <%Rafraud> eh I wouldn't worry about res but fair
[1:53:31] <+extradopeness> God i wanna invade so badly lmao
[1:53:31] <zhenthrim213> roam the main floor
[1:53:34] <%fetrigon> hall wuggin
[1:53:37] <%Rafraud> gonna take the poison anyways
[1:53:43] <Visorak6> Why is he equipping poison resist, it doesnt decrease the damage?
[1:53:48] <+Checktrap> hocNega hocNega hocNega
[1:53:52] <%Dakuu75> Is there a “get more souls” ring?
[1:53:59] <+Checktrap> REGGIE !!!
[1:53:59] <+Shishi1205> @Dakuu75 yes
[1:54:01] <Darren716> Eh at this point it's better to just estus up
[1:54:04] <andre11dr> He'll get poisoned anyway, it doesn't matter
[1:54:04] <Johannen> It is ironic that pyro dies in a swamp when he has the best gear to deal with it)
[1:54:07] <+Shishi1205> silver serpent
[1:54:19] <+Checktrap> You'er my hero !
[1:54:29] <youngking_kush> Poison Resistance is useless cuz it doesnt decrease the damage it just makes the bar longer and you will get poisoned anyway @woolieversus
[1:54:41] <%Dakuu75> @shishi1205 Is it worth it or is it like 3% or something?
[1:54:46] <Lunalios> covetous serpent's ring, but that's after he rings both bells
[1:54:47] <%vivaciouseff> @extradopeness i've been spamming invasions but just getting other folks BibleThump
[1:54:48] <agustorm123> Just get the fire resist tho for later
[1:54:49] <+Shishi1205> I think its worth
[1:55:00] <Johannen> @youngking_kush I think it last the same amount of time anyway, it does make it easier to avoid it sometimes
[1:55:05] <%Dakuu75> Neat
[1:55:09] <+Archphronimos> @Dakuu75 I don't remember the exact percentage, but I think it's worth it
[1:55:15] <%Rafraud> pog advice
[1:55:25] <QueequegTheater> Chat you need to be level 53 or lower, just FYI Kappa
[1:55:25] <scarman125> paring the poison bite ring with some poison resist armor and it makes a difference but I don't think he bought the ring.
[1:55:33] <%CateHecate> pig shinobi reggarth
[1:55:38] <+Shishi1205> 20% soul increase
[1:55:40] <gryffinp> I think he's probably still in the invasion grace period
[1:55:41] <+Jiggisnipe> gotta keep the helmet on. nice SeemsGood
[1:55:42] <BigYanno> just accept the poison
[1:55:43] <%trigunstar26> my best set was upgrade elite knight chest with ninja gear
[1:55:45] <andre11dr> Still can't invade him ,wtf
[1:55:45] <+Shishi1205> just looked it up
[1:55:46] <AbnormalVoid> Demon's Great Hammer, a man of taste
[1:55:48] <+askalta> has reg ever been summoned yet?
[1:55:50] <+Awkward_Cyborg> yep
[1:56:02] <+Shishi1205> The best quick farm btw is in the painted world vs lance vois
[1:56:07] <%livlinn> woolieMIRIN
[1:56:08] <+Shishi1205> quick 10k
[1:56:08] <QueequegTheater> @gryffinp He hasn't beaten a boss though, I thought it was bosses only
[1:56:16] <%CateHecate> thats a cool look
[1:56:32] <BigYanno> honestly poison resist is a scam. Sure it'll take like 5 seconds longer to get poisoned, but you also naturally take AGES to lose the poison
[1:56:33] <%Indigo_Automaton> BOAR SHINOBI
[1:56:35] <glass_marcus> which is why res is a garbo stat
[1:56:36] <Parapattern> The Boar Helm is non-negotiable
[1:56:39] <+Amaideus> The bar gets bigger, but it fills at the same rate per second
[1:56:39] <%Rafraud> resist is the literal worst stat lmao
[1:56:41] <youngking_kush> Embrace the poison
[1:56:41] <%CateHecate> GODS I WAS STRONG THEN
[1:56:42] <gryffinp> I think that after you get invaded or npc invaded there's a grace period
[1:56:43] <%Juriasu> does it affect how fast the poison drains health after it procs?
[1:56:43] <andre11dr> I'm trying really hard to get Reggie, i have a +3 Demon Machete, it should connect
[1:56:48] <Johannen> Its more of a pvp thing anyway
[1:56:52] <+Shishi1205> res is good vs curse
[1:56:54] <+Shishi1205> and toxic
[1:56:55] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:56:58] <MeImoth> yeah just learn to live with the poison is the way to go here
[1:57:02] <+Shishi1205> and direct elements
[1:57:04] <+extradopeness> isnt pyro set the best for poisin res
[1:57:05] <%A_German_spy> @Juriasu Nah
[1:57:13] <youngking_kush> @juriasu No, that's why it's useless
[1:57:14] <%trigunstar26> hell yeah
[1:57:17] <%CateHecate> somethin in the water
[1:57:21] <%A_German_spy> @Juriasu Just the length of the poison meter
[1:57:21] <LoreKeeper_Thal> it's goop!
[1:57:22] <Parapattern> The Sludge
[1:57:25] <Darren716> Reg put on rusted iron right?
[1:57:26] <Lunalios> omg I just realized you can cosplay inosuke in this game lmao
[1:57:28] <MeImoth> 10 Estus will help more against the poison then anything lese
[1:57:37] <%Juriasu> @A_German_spy oh right, yeah
[1:57:37] <pepinillomaton> I made some fine art based on this episode
[1:57:50] <%thetunnelhomer> I don't think I've EVER seen anyone use the titanite demon spear
[1:57:51] <+CoRascal> moen @A_German_spy
[1:57:53] <%CateHecate> YOU NEVER HAVE TO DO IT AGAIN
[1:58:01] <%trigunstar26> yeah i ended up switching to pryo gear once i got it
[1:58:02] <BigYanno> this is the part of blight town I actually like
[1:58:08] <LunarRemix> You will play this zone while poisoned
[1:58:08] <%hax_metatron> Not so fast Woolie.  There's still the Toxic corner giftshop near the end
[1:58:11] <+CoRascal> Good to see ya; I haven't been around for a minute, but yours is a familiar name!
[1:58:22] <AbnormalVoid> forgot to get the whip, it's essential Kappa
[1:58:23] <Darren716> Ayy the grind pit
[1:58:24] <Johannen> I farmed the hell outa those leeches, good source of upgrade materials
[1:58:25] <%A_German_spy> @CoRascal charly23Hi
[1:58:26] <%trigunstar26> elite armor was too upgraded to not use
[1:58:27] <nxflre> kill all the slugs reggie they drop good stuff
[1:58:29] <+Shishi1205> hey look the great hollow
[1:58:29] <+Checktrap> Spear and shield is kinda swag !
[1:58:33] <%cobalt_phoenix_> i wonder how or if woolie will tell reggie how to get the pyro master
[1:58:34] <+Shishi1205> one of the worst parts
[1:58:36] <BigYanno> Hey look it's large and green boys
[1:58:37] <+extradopeness> hes gonna get stuck at the bottom of the hollow isnt he
[1:58:42] <sirrice77> Personally i would say having too much poison resist is actually a detriment here since it makes the bar bigger and thus the poison lasts longer. Being poisoned here is just how it is
[1:58:42] <+pupil31> Reggie Ballin now
[1:58:47] <youngking_kush> There's a better catalyst in this area
[1:58:50] <+Jiggisnipe> big whiff
[1:58:50] <%CateHecate> catchpole and catalyst is a really cool look
[1:58:54] <+askalta> its honestly the best catalyst until like low 30s int
[1:58:55] <+Archphronimos> Oh snap hey @A_German_spy !
[1:59:08] <%trigunstar26> Reggie looks so boss now
[1:59:13] <Parapattern> Melee spell: I cast punch you in the kidney
[1:59:13] <andre11dr> I just realized, if Reggie is going Str Int ,that means we might see the MLB used the playthrough

[1:59:46] <scarman125> I fully expect him to never go up the root
[1:59:49] <%trigunstar26> hope he gets some green shards
[1:59:49] <IanMidi> Oh no, it's melee town.

[2:00:37] <%IronOhki> Oh man this farm pit.
[2:00:37] <penitentpendant> Considering the amount of Stamina you have to sacrifice for it. It's a fair trade.
[2:00:40] <QueequegTheater> The BEFORE TIMES
[2:00:43] <Treasure_Vault> It sure is great to be watching this from when elden ring is out
[2:00:43] <youngking_kush> I've already got an Elden Ring build in my head lol

[2:02:17] <thegreatpapi> Pick up the slug loot

[2:02:20] <+Awkward_Cyborg> i think the server is one of the least used weapons in this game

[2:02:23] <+Shishi1205> @woolieversus  slugs dropped loot
[2:02:24] <andre11dr> That weapon is WACK

[2:02:50] <%Solidnick18> and healing
[2:02:50] <+Amaideus> Honestly I've always hated that moveset
[2:02:51] <Qsmash_> Donovan from Darkstalkers uses one
[2:02:54] <pepinillomaton> But ugly as sin
[2:02:55] <andre11dr> Sadly, it sucks
[2:02:57] <%WerdIce> That poison burn is kinda asmr
[2:02:57] <%A_German_spy> @chainsaw105 This isn't actually an Occult-infused weapon. That's just its flavor text.
[2:03:00] <%Rafraud> slug  loot poggies
[2:03:00] <BigYanno> it's kinda cool, though it's reach leaves something to be desired
[2:03:02] <+TheFrancix> it's not quelag time yet?
[2:03:05] <%Irridium> those Redguards had curved swords. Curved swords!
[2:03:07] <%CateHecate> fun fact, the blade is shaped like and has a design on it that makes it look like a CERTAIN CHARACTER we'll be meeting later, who *might* have a connection to a whole lot of ancient occult shit Kappa
[2:03:08] <%Solidnick18> oof heavy
[2:03:08] <QueequegTheater> Lucatiel's sword is a much better implementation of Dex GS
[2:03:08] <JetpackMcQuack> the tickler
[2:03:09] <%hax_metatron> It serves you an Internet
[2:03:10] <peachy996> Looks kind of like a Hooksword
[2:03:16] <%mr_sups> Kukri
[2:03:18] <%trigunstar26> AC Origins has a lot of weapons like that
[2:03:18] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @TheFrancix almost
[2:03:23] <@Solidus_113> I think it's the same amount as the eye
[2:03:26] <%sewermonk> cool weapon, not for reg 😔
[2:03:28] <dundore77> its almost Rena's weapon from higurashi
[2:03:29] <a_mad_dragon_> it's an orc sword
[2:03:31] <Equirah> RIP Large shard
[2:03:33] <andre11dr> It just look like a worst Demon Machete
[2:03:38] <KeiganOfAstora> It's never as good as Demon's Souls
[2:03:39] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[2:03:40] <%Rafraud> the branch
[2:03:43] <%CateHecate> this is the melty setup

[2:03:52] <%ozzrabbit> Everybody tell “SKIRTS!” In chat

[2:04:19] <andre11dr> I didn't know Paige was playing today
[2:04:32] <%Ensign_Epic> OH GOD DON'T
[2:04:32] <%IronOhki> Never Back Down 3: Always Back Down
[2:04:32] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> no...no onions though
[2:04:35] <+cdrom321> Looking in every direction except the ramp.
[2:04:37] <jett_eyes> time to go to the best zone in the game
[2:04:38] <+RemedyofRevenge> got ReggieSaliva on the mic today
[2:04:41] <Visorak6> Back to poison
[2:04:48] <+RemedyofRevenge> poison poison poison
[2:04:51] <%IronOhki> Is it fine to spoil this?
[2:04:54] <Treasure_Vault> Did Reggie grab the slug loot? I had a blueberry emergency.
[2:04:57] <destinyspider> Oh no. Not before he can teleport...
[2:04:57] <subjectg> Fun fact about the Server: It’s i think the only weapon in the game that has its lore text change when infused
[2:04:57] <KumaTorey> ok Why is Reggie using the demon pole now? LUL
[2:04:57] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @IronOhki no
[2:04:59] <+Jiggisnipe> no
[2:05:00] <scarman125> why is he leaving?
[2:05:02] <%hiswill98> I think the next area is worse personally
[2:05:04] <%Rafraud> Reggie can't see chat
[2:05:07] <%WerdIce> Oof owie my tree
[2:05:09] <LoreKeeper_Thal> @KumaTorey because it's good
[2:05:10] <%Rafraud> woolie can
[2:05:11] <%A_German_spy> @IronOhki No. And only Woolie is watching chat, to prevent spoilers.
[2:05:21] <agustorm123> Who is this smash player LUL
[2:05:25] <youngking_kush> He wanted befriend you Reggie
[2:05:26] <%trigunstar26> @subjectg pyro flame as well
[2:05:26] <+swesterly> Because chat can’t keep it in their pants
[2:05:33] <%IronOhki> Clarification: is it okay for Woolie to say the thing.
[2:05:47] <+Jiggisnipe> he probably won't
[2:05:48] <penitentpendant> @swesterly It's NNN, so there's extra pressure on them
[2:05:49] <oneimportantthing> Because of One Guy
[2:05:50] <+セビー> Woolie said he’d point out bs stuff..
[2:05:53] <+SuperFightinRobot> If Reggie can't see chat, what is worse, blighttown or Sen's?
[2:05:58] <%Rafraud> woolie gives Reggie chat advice at his own discretion
[2:05:59] <+Jiggisnipe> he likes Reggie to figure things out
[2:06:02] <pepinillomaton> O_O
[2:06:03] <%CateHecate> sen's 100%
[2:06:04] <Treasure_Vault> @SuperFightinRobot Blight.
[2:06:05] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @SuperFightinRobot blight imo
[2:06:07] <Visorak6> Get rid of that poison
[2:06:07] <agustorm123> Ohhh
[2:06:12] <Equirah> is he gonna get the 12 lizards here? LUL
[2:06:13] <%robosqueeb> reggie will actually figure it out
[2:06:13] <Darren716> Blight, Sen is actually fun
[2:06:15] <Xaeveax> Sens was really fun to figure out
[2:06:16] <youngking_kush> Reggie cant see chat but that's what Woolie is for
[2:06:18] <pepinillomaton> Will he tell him?
[2:06:23] <%vVAstrAVv> if you let him go down the hollow without the lv its gonna be bad lol
[2:06:24] <Treasure_Vault> Slug has loot!
[2:06:24] <agustorm123> Time to get the stones
[2:06:25] <%IronOhki> Let's watch and find out.
[2:06:27] <+swesterly> All it takes is one guy to fucking ruin things, for example stickbug
[2:06:29] <+kevlarkoala> @SuperFightinRobot Blight no question. Sen's fortress is difficult and has some annoying areas. Blight is difficult and annoying the entire time
[2:06:39] <penitentpendant> Thanks random message!
[2:06:41] <RabbitOTM> Plank Shield PogChamp
[2:06:46] <+cdrom321> Deprived died here.
[2:06:47] <+TheFrancix> SECRET AHEAD REGGIE
[2:06:48] <peachy996> Love that Bloodborne shield
[2:06:49] <%CateHecate> E N G E N D E R S  P A S S I V I T Y
[2:06:49] <subjectg> This is why messages are a cool system
[2:06:51] <%Indigo_Automaton> It's the same shield
[2:06:54] <andre11dr> There's no way Reggie figures this out on his own
[2:06:54] <%IronOhki> Shh.
[2:06:54] <haisho> ah yes the 2 by 4
[2:06:56] <JetpackMcQuack> what an enigma
[2:06:56] <+xyxlzyzm> yeah sen's has traps and death falls but that's not as annoying as toxic imo
[2:06:56] <+kevlarkoala> Sen's fortress has good aspects. there is NOTHING good about Blight
[2:06:56] <velgaduere> it's the Bloodborne shield PogChamp
[2:06:57] <+extradopeness> get stick bugged lol
[2:06:59] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[2:06:59] <kinkade_77> Bloodborne shield
[2:07:00] <+Jiggisnipe> oh that's the Deprived maybe
[2:07:02] <%IronOhki> I love that description.
[2:07:03] <youngking_kush> Woolie probably left that message on the ground
[2:07:05] <DSD24> Why
[2:07:07] <%IronOhki> Good good.
[2:07:09] <+SuperFightinRobot> All good points. I remember having a bad time with Sen's but it is probably just because I had been hearing such bad things about blighttown that I kinda braced myself for it
[2:07:10] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @alphonseisbest
[2:07:11] <JetpackMcQuack> crazy
[2:07:13] <MeImoth> this is the shield the Depraved class starts with
[2:07:15] <andre11dr> HOW
[2:07:21] <velgaduere> PogChamp
[2:07:21] <penitentpendant> Thanks message x2
[2:07:22] <%IronOhki> HE DID IT!
[2:07:24] <pepinillomaton> POG
[2:07:25] <agustorm123> Moderate Humilliation LUL
[2:07:26] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Funny how they went from "lol shields" in Bloodborne to the new guard counter mechanic in Elden Ring, eh?
[2:07:29] <%Rafraud> DIDN'T KNOW THAT LMAO
[2:07:30] <available_line> top message
[2:07:30] <Jontman42> bless message

[2:07:36] <%townzzzzz> DEEPER AND DEEPER
[2:07:39] <zhenthrim213> are we going to my favorite souls area?
[2:07:40] <%Juriasu> +400
[2:07:43] <subjectg> we wanna leave this for later lol
[2:07:43] <QueequegTheater> @Rafraud You didn't know about this zone?
[2:07:43] <%Bread_Assassin> I wonder how many people missed this their first time.
[2:07:44] <LordOfThePoultry> its all downhill from here
[2:07:44] <+cdrom321> Still the instant 400 souls from nothing.
[2:07:47] <%Solidnick18> the boyz
[2:07:50] <+kevlarkoala> @A_German_spy aka huge sign that they want a larger audience for Elden Ring, IMO
[2:07:52] <%IronOhki> @LordOfThePoultry Now you listen here.
[2:07:54] <%Rafraud> didn't know about the second wall
[2:07:55] <%Indigo_Automaton> PogChamp
[2:07:55] <velgaduere> this is like that one room in Brinstar in Super Metroid with items behind the item room... and then more items behind that LUL
[2:07:56] <+mundanelotus> A while ass area
[2:08:01] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> it is
[2:08:02] <LordOfThePoultry> LUL
[2:08:03] <+Bob_Tom> this wont softlock will it
[2:08:03] <+Jiggisnipe> it is
[2:08:04] <%hax_metatron> No Woolie
[2:08:06] <+Amaideus> @Rafraud Oh you're in for some shit then
[2:08:10] <+Darky04> i woudln't go down here yet tbh
[2:08:11] <pepinillomaton> If he goes down and rest at the bonfire we are gonna be here for a while
[2:08:12] <%hax_metatron> I respect From for doing that
[2:08:12] <AbnormalVoid> ! GRAVITY !
[2:08:13] <Qsmash_> isn't this area just side content?
[2:08:15] <+Jiggisnipe> secret door within secret door
[2:08:15] <JetpackMcQuack> the internet pulled through again
[2:08:16] <andre11dr> @rafraud Really?
[2:08:17] <scarman125> no reaction at all from Reggie LUL
[2:08:18] <%Irridium> I completely missed it my first time
[2:08:20] <+robertoszek> messages help
[2:08:20] <Tracazoid> Only found the zone on NG+ after reading about it on the internet with a, "wait, what!"
[2:08:23] <Johannen> You can find some illusory walls with a help of a miracle that shows hidden dev messages
[2:08:23] <%Javaa01> @Qsmash_ It's important side content
[2:08:23] <+Jiggisnipe> Xzibit made this section
[2:08:23] <%OfficerMods> I remember clearly playing this game at launch finding the humanities and going, "nah this aint right" and hitting the wall
[2:08:25] <youngking_kush> It really feels like Elden Ring is the game FS has been trying to make this whole time
[2:08:25] <subjectg> @qsmash_ it’s loot and stuff
[2:08:25] <%IronOhki> Getting back up is not that bad. Long ladders available.
[2:08:27] <+robertoszek> bs nonetheless
[2:08:29] <+askalta> Woolie please dont let reggie sit at the bonfire after this one lol
[2:08:34] <scarman125> yeah I also never found the Hollow on my first play through
[2:08:34] <%Rafraud> I didn't have a message on the chest so I never swung after the first wall
[2:08:38] <+extradopeness> theres a world of pain waiting down there
[2:08:39] <+matshat> I found it because it seemed odd to go all the wayto the edge of the swamp, find nothing, then just a shitty item
[2:08:41] <%A_German_spy> @Qsmash_ Technically it's optional, but there's some really good stuff down there that you can't get anywhere else.
[2:08:43] <Equirah> Woolie at anything hidden: that's some bullshit
[2:08:44] <AbnormalVoid> I legit just found it, I was suspicious as fuck
[2:08:46] <QueequegTheater> @Qsmash_ Everything but like 9 bosses is side content
[2:08:47] <%Ensign_Epic> This is one of the worst ideas to do at this point tbh

[2:08:53] <@Solidus_113> the most optional and coolest area
[2:08:56] <andre11dr> @rafraud It's a pretty important zone it leads too
[2:08:57] <JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[2:09:00] <+matshat> it just felt like there should be more and there is. Felt amazing to find natrually
[2:09:00] <%Ensign_Epic> Ash Lake is a fucking HIKE to get back from
[2:09:03] <KyberNasse> This is the cool minicon behind BlightCon, where only the cool people go
[2:09:03] <subjectg> @ironohki it’s not bad, but it is a timesink
[2:09:04] <RedCycloneInc> Careful, it's rough to climb back up if you go all the way down, maybe wait till after
[2:09:04] <BigYanno> there is a moment for ash lake. this ain't it.
[2:09:11] <%IronOhki> @subjectg Fair point
[2:09:14] <%Indigo_Automaton> LUL
[2:09:14] <QueequegTheater> LUL
[2:09:16] <%hax_metatron> WHY NotLikeThis All games have secrets LUL
[2:09:18] <MeImoth> well, the spiritual precursor of the Souls series, Kings Field, has like fivefold nested Secret Walls
[2:09:22] <%WerdIce> Cloranthy ring is my “to the end of the game”

[2:31:22] <+BananaSlammuh> Anything with the Boar Hat and Reggie loves it
[2:31:24] <subjectg> Killing Reggie drops a pendant that sells for 40,000 pesetas
[2:31:24] <youngking_kush> THE BOAR SHAMAN
[2:31:26] <drunken_lemur> Real Plague Doctor masks were a lot less cool than the illustrations would make you think.
[2:31:27] <Darren716> This spell is great on the way down
[2:31:32] <haitakaa> Vulva huh
[2:31:43] <DSD24> She did a pretty bad job
[2:31:47] <velgaduere> so Yulva is Astraea
[2:31:55] <%cobalt_phoenix_> well that went well
[2:31:56] <%hax_metatron> She died immediately upon enterinng Blighttown LUL
[2:31:57] <+Shishi1205> 40.000 pesetas huh
[2:31:59] <+TheFrancix> ATTUNE THAT SHIT
[2:31:59] <Equirah> So that poll just scammed all our points huh? LUL
[2:32:01] <%debrv> At least she tried.
[2:32:10] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Equirah rip
[2:32:12] <+Shishi1205> she went down like two ladders
[2:32:12] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:32:14] <%robosqueeb> she tried so hard
[2:32:16] <subjectg> @equirah they can cancel predictions
[2:32:18] <velgaduere> @Equirah what? it's still up
[2:32:23] <velgaduere> he hasn't even tried yet
[2:32:23] <%Bread_Assassin> Woulda been more useful if you got it before the end of the poison swamp.
[2:32:25] <AbnormalVoid> ONLY FOR THE ATTACK
[2:32:27] <%CateHecate> yeah its not great
[2:32:35] <andre11dr> @drunken_lemur Also they didn't even work, because they thought the plague was being transmitted from air ,it wasn't
[2:32:37] <+ds3namecaldara> LUL
[2:32:41] <AbnormalVoid> ONLY Mag Adjust matters for casting formulas
[2:32:47] <youngking_kush> @bread_assassin That's the joke lol
[2:32:54] <%Artoo__The_Me> Dat dex tho
[2:33:15] <%patriotrenegade> No PHYS. Only MAJ ADGST
[2:33:17] <subjectg> @andre11dr the masks had fragrances stuffed in them because the prevailing theory was that miasma and bad smells caused disease
[2:33:18] <+Shishi1205> theres a better melee catalyst
[2:33:21] <agustorm123> You need magic fingers
[2:33:29] <JetpackMcQuack> hell yeah
[2:33:29] <velgaduere> tfw it's longer than ur weapon
[2:33:31] <glass_marcus> DUAL WIELD
[2:33:31] <%IronOhki> @Shishi1205 Yea but we have this now.
[2:33:32] <%hax_metatron> Now we Elden Ring
[2:33:35] <youngking_kush> The poke is lowkey useful
[2:33:36] <%Rafraud> chat they know he's just trying it
[2:33:41] <DapperCadavr> this is kinda sick
[2:33:41] <+Shishi1205> stick man
[2:33:44] <velgaduere> poke stick
[2:33:45] <WoawDesu> Kinda sick

[2:33:46] <%CateHecate> poke stick
[2:33:55] <haitakaa> off hand spears were always annoying in PVP
[2:33:57] <+AyupaPupa> ohh elden ring
[2:33:58] <+liquidzr0> ooooooh
[2:34:13] <%WerdIce> Elden Ring has javelins, that's some shit
[2:34:21] <youngking_kush> It's an interrupt
[2:34:22] <andre11dr> That catalyst is good to beat the game with
[2:34:26] <%CateHecate> DS1 is absolutely full of fun ideas that are kind of mechanically not good
[2:34:31] <%cobalt_phoenix_> LUL
[2:34:32] <haitakaa> LUL
[2:34:33] <%IronOhki> It begins.
[2:34:36] <AbnormalVoid> daaa daaa dadada
[2:34:38] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> it's britney bitch
[2:34:45] <%IronOhki> Wee woo wee woo
[2:34:45] <subjectg> i’m addicted to you
[2:34:50] <penitentpendant> What a brave time to heal
[2:34:51] <Shwepie> @AbnormalVoid This is true, and thankfully the Mag Adjust displayed is already including all scaling information.
[2:34:52] <nxflre> Did he aalreaady see the boss?
[2:34:52] <haitakaa> toxic streamer :(
[2:35:08] <+Reverend_Roscoe> no

[2:35:27] <agustorm123> So toxic
[2:35:28] <AbnormalVoid> yep
[2:35:28] <andre11dr> This isn't even Dokapon
[2:35:33] <$SilverRoddo> It’s nice to want things
[2:35:41] <%IronOhki> I legit still get turned around doing this.
[2:36:09] <pepinillomaton> respect the pottery
[2:36:16] <youngking_kush> I think he needs to go back down
[2:36:17] <KumaTorey> getting hit with toxic at blightcon is when you walk by a nerd and get hit by a wall of B.O
[2:36:27] <haitakaa> now imagine doing this with 10fps
[2:36:27] <youngking_kush> Like 1 floor
[2:36:31] <%trigunstar26> i hope reggie gets to the boss so i can get back to my playthrough
[2:36:36] <velgaduere> stupid bloodstain
[2:36:41] <LunarRemix> Man Reggie's doing great
[2:36:52] <%hax_metatron> Wow, Reggie didn't even get stumped on that branch. So proud

[2:37:00] <subjectg> Tip: the torches signal ladders
[2:37:01] <pepinillomaton> He didn't even died at the bullshit branch, compliment this man
[2:37:15] <penitentpendant> To be fair to people, getting spit on will generally make ANYONE ! TOXIC ! even outside of Blightcon
[2:37:17] <youngking_kush> Ahhh
[2:37:20] <agustorm123> That bulshit phisics

[2:40:51] <+SuperFightinRobot> The best way to avoid worrying about poison in blighttown is just to be poisoned

[2:41:08] <%Ensign_Epic> I'm just sitting down here in the swamp. Killing people. Waiting for humanity to be rerstored
[2:41:09] <%A_German_spy> @Josef_Stryker But poison and toxin don't overwrite each other in DS1, so you can get poisoned by a weaker source like the swamp or the mosquitoes first, which protects you against the much nastier toxin from the blowdart assholes
[2:41:10] <pepinillomaton> i was right
[2:41:13] <%hax_metatron> He did what he was hired for. Respect to blowbart man

[2:44:27] <%patriotrenegade> literally the same as the last soul
[2:44:29] <+Amaideus> Man, imagine how shit a job being the fire keeper for blight town must've been
[2:44:39] <%A_German_spy> @Josef_Stryker Yeah. The Toxic from Dung Pies is less severe than from the blowdart guys.

[2:45:59] <+Shishi1205> Kreygasm

[2:50:19] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Darren716 he doesn't know where that is
[2:50:19] <%A_German_spy> @gulthrax Well
[2:50:19] <Slim_Lipid> @Jaysky fecal swamp but it's also the Lost Woods from BotW
[2:50:19] <+Shishi1205> he does not know theres a boss
[2:50:28] <oneimportantthing> Man this will be GREAT
[2:50:37] <+cubbywolf> let's go
[2:50:38] <%A_German_spy> @gulthrax my take on that is, based on what we've learned in the past, we'd be wise to temper our expectations
[2:50:39] <%CateHecate> big swings like papu papu
[2:50:41] <+pupil31> Bonk Brothers
[2:50:41] <+extradopeness> talk about it talk about it talk about moooving
[2:50:42] <Darren716> @cobalt_phoenix_ i mean Woolie told him where progress was
[2:50:45] <+Shishi1205> rip
[2:50:45] <+pupil31> OOF
[2:50:46] <Equirah> why does he have prism stones in his hotbar?
[2:50:46] <AbnormalVoid> Deadangled
[2:50:47] <penitentpendant> Bounced
[2:50:47] <+cubbywolf> F
[2:50:48] <%townzzzzz> LUL
[2:50:49] <+Jiggisnipe> BIG HITBOX
[2:50:51] <velgaduere> flew too close to the sun
[2:50:52] <subjectg> Nice roll catch
[2:50:59] <%hax_metatron> He should probably finish the boss before going up again
[2:51:04] <Monkeyweed21> so close
[2:51:08] <andre11dr> He poisoned your corpse  that's disrespectful
[2:51:08] <agustorm123> Poison after dead LUL
[2:51:08] <BigYanno> at least it's not a long runback
[2:51:09] <+cubbywolf> the second he rolled past I knew he was dead
[2:51:18] <+セビー> might wanna attune the free moss spell
[2:51:26] <%cobalt_phoenix_> LUL
[2:51:33] <restingbones> doigswCry so much poison, I hate this area
[2:51:36] <%townzzzzz> we'll get our point bets back some day
[2:51:37] <%Dakuu75> I hope all the spells cast faster in elden ring. Can’t stand how slow some animations are in souls games
[2:51:39] <%Th3SmartAlec> remember everyone, Woolie does not read chat Kappa
[2:51:44] <penitentpendant> Honestly, chat's been surprisingly chill about skipping breakfast atm
[2:51:48] <velgaduere> baffles me how many people think this first playthrough is some kind of omniscient speedrun
[2:51:48] <nxflre> Think they missed a chest up theeree
[2:51:59] <a_mad_dragon_> has he made it to the drake valley door yet?
[2:52:03] <28moogles> We all know that he has to climb up here after, but he doesn't. Let him have his first playthrough. lol
[2:52:03] <BigYanno> I do it from on top of the wheel. It's safer
[2:52:03] <+extradopeness> yeah there is another chest right?
[2:52:03] <+vaderxyz1970> on top is easier
[2:52:08] <andre11dr> @dakuu75 Some stats make the casing speed faster
[2:52:16] <%A_German_spy> @velgaduere You get it a lot as a content creator.
[2:52:17] <nxflre> @a_mad_dragon_ almost but died to the giants
[2:52:19] <+Jiggisnipe> I guess most people don't explore before they advance the area
[2:52:20] <BigYanno> lol. safe
[2:52:31] <%cobalt_phoenix_> the key to the waterpark
[2:52:31] <xXVeggiePLusXx> That prediction was a while ago LUL
[2:52:34] <+vaderxyz1970> I've fallen off that thing so many damn times to not waiting a second
[2:52:35] <Darren716> I just think doing it this way is terrible for the story too
[2:52:35] <%patriotrenegade> Reggie you have so much moss
[2:52:39] <+extradopeness> the flies are so gd annoying tho
[2:52:46] <velgaduere> @A_German_spy yeah I see it plenty, but good lord, it could just be avoided with just a single second of thought
[2:52:46] <+pupil31> Dengue fever monkaS
[2:52:49] <gulthrax> @A_German_spy are you saying i should hold off on getting a custom made poster of Miyazaki and George RR Martin locked in a gentle embrace?
[2:52:51] <Darren716> Like Reggie should only get the surprise once he's done both bells
[2:52:53] <+cdrom321> @Th3SmartAlec We're fully aware of Woolie's faults like not reading chat.
[2:52:55] <%trigunstar26> i guess he's going back to firelink
[2:53:04] <pepinillomaton> Once I discovered this entrance to blightown, I never again came trough the other oine
[2:53:12] <+cubbywolf> looks right
[2:53:13] <velgaduere> @trigunstar26 he has no idea where he's going. this is a first playthrough.
[2:53:21] <%A_German_spy> @gulthrax I mean... that's up to you spyShock
[2:53:21] <%trigunstar26> i know
[2:53:26] <glass_marcus> Yea but they're also extinct
[2:53:35] <%A_German_spy> @gulthrax I just mean, temper your hype until the game's out
[2:53:35] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[2:53:55] <Darren716> Can't ghosts just go through the door?
[2:53:56] <+extradopeness> capital D Dark
[2:53:59] <andre11dr> Master key is pretty sweet to skip like half of Blighttown, unless you want the Iauto
[2:54:01] <SoaringTrumpet> we don't go to new londo
[2:54:03] <+cubbywolf> and it'll happen to youuuuu
[2:54:09] <velgaduere> @A_German_spy if only they would doodSmug
[2:54:15] <+Shishi1205> shimmy
[2:54:23] <+extradopeness> you can skip it without the master key tho
[2:54:25] <agustorm123> Is a fucked up place
[2:54:30] <%CateHecate> Pat's point way waaaay back in the DS2 LP about how calling it the capital D Dark instead of "the darkness" is so much better

[3:08:14] <BigYanno> it's a bit of an investment
[3:08:14] <agustorm123> Woolie is now vatividjia
[3:08:15] <%CateHecate> @RyTYoung he doesnt, the crow carries him to anor londo
[3:08:15] <velgaduere> nahhhh that ain't much
[3:08:17] <+Shishi1205> its 50k last upgrade tho
[3:08:21] <+extradopeness> come ooooooooon GREAT FIREBALL LETS GO
[3:08:25] <nxflre> OR someone he summons with a a+10
[3:08:25] <Johannen> No way they have the souls for it
[3:08:28] <JetpackMcQuack> PrideShrug
[3:08:29] <%trigunstar26> flash sweat is good
[3:08:30] <+cubbywolf> spells though
[3:08:31] <BigYanno> at this stage it's quite an investment
[3:08:44] <haitakaa> you can always get more souls
[3:08:47] <@Solidus_113> I know it's 149,500 to get to +15
[3:08:47] <%cobalt_phoenix_> as long as he hits +10 before bed of chaos he's good
[3:08:49] <didipackums1> Bro pump that flame
[3:08:50] <+RyTYoung> @catehecate that's what I thought...

[3:09:23] <%trigunstar26> GRIND STREAM LESS GOOO PogChamp PogChamp
[3:09:28] <agustorm123> Is a secret
[3:09:31] <+Malysitos> This is essentially the final turning point for builds. Reggie will have to make his decision very soon
[3:09:36] <JetpackMcQuack> invest in pyrocoin
[3:09:37] <%cobalt_phoenix_> +5 is good
[3:09:42] <hazeprojekt> a generous summoned friend could also drop him a +10 flame
[3:09:47] <%cobalt_phoenix_> does that affect the power within buff?
[3:09:48] <+cdrom321> @velgaduere We're talking about Lautrec, not Reggie. The crow takes him to Anor Londo.
[3:09:49] <%CateHecate> $PYRO is going up, hodl
[3:09:50] <haitakaa> pyro is always worth it imo
[3:09:50] <0ddeye> I think Lautrec is doing that woman a favor honestly...
[3:09:59] <%CommanderSqueaks> @0ddeye We found the accomplice.
[3:10:09] <andre11dr> So now that it happened, i must say,   Yurt>Leonard>Lautrec>Craiton
[3:10:10] <+Ataerus> FireBois!
[3:10:14] <+extradopeness> chaoscoin to a the moon
[3:10:15] <velgaduere> BIG invest
[3:10:16] <peachy996> What if the Crow did it?
[3:10:25] <%mihokspawn> @hazeprojekt no need to drop it, just apear in the game with it... but that isimposible with the reworked network xD
[3:10:27] <agustorm123> Crow is sus
[3:10:35] <%CateHecate> ...who killed hannibal?
[3:10:35] <+Shishi1205> yeah how the hell did lautrec end up in anor londo and who the fuck are his pals?
[3:10:37] <+robertoszek> he put her out of her misery but that was not his intention really, so...
[3:10:51] <%diegobandzz> lmaooo
[3:10:54] <%Dakuu75> wheel in the sky keeps on turnin~
[3:10:55] <+swesterly> Bone

[3:11:25] <youngking_kush> Time to bone out
[3:11:25] <+セビー> I kinda imagined that lautrec came from another world and needed the soul for.. something

[3:12:04] <%cobalt_phoenix_> don't waste a bone
[3:12:09] <%mihokspawn> faster to die?
[3:12:12] <%hax_metatron> No good
[3:12:13] <agustorm123> Don’t waste it
[3:12:13] <%hax_metatron> You're good
[3:12:14] <velgaduere> there was another ladder right?
[3:12:15] <%hax_metatron> You  got it all
[3:12:15] <available_line> It's 500 / 1500 / 3500 / 6500 / 10500 / 16000 / 23000 / 31500 / 41500 / 53500
[3:12:15] <nxflre> nah you got the chest
[3:12:18] <Darren716> You're fine
[3:12:19] <%hax_metatron> You got all the items

[3:12:26] <Darren716> You got it
[3:12:27] <moonmintparadise> he got it
[3:12:29] <nxflre> it was the key to geet to New Lonodo
[3:12:30] <%CommanderSqueaks> Everyone losing their mind, acting like Woolie hasn't been playing the game himself.
[3:12:32] <Omentus> wait did he beat quelaag?
[3:12:34] <%Dakuu75> “Good-good… let the hate flow through you~”
[3:12:35] <+swesterly> No he got it
[3:12:39] <28moogles> don't waste a bone on 100 souls
[3:12:39] <velgaduere> wasn't there a ladder he chose not to take?
[3:12:40] <%cobalt_phoenix_> use the mark not bone, you only got 100 souls
[3:12:42] <28moogles> use darksign
[3:12:44] <andre11dr> Just die ,you only have 100 souls
[3:12:45] <+Rasheedt> @omentus no
[3:12:48] <hazeprojekt> could get shield from dragon corpse
[3:12:51] <+swesterly> It was the new londo key
[3:12:52] <JetpackMcQuack> enjoy the atmosphere
[3:12:53] <velgaduere> darksign is a pretty strong idea
[3:13:02] <+RemedyofRevenge> homeward bone would also work
[3:13:06] <dundore77> the back door to blightcon
[3:13:11] <nxflre> lose the 1 humanity
[3:13:11] <+pupil31> Wow
[3:13:13] <JetpackMcQuack> aw
[3:13:17] <+Shishi1205> he loses humanity with darksign
[3:13:18] <+pupil31> Really damn
[3:13:19] <agustorm123> Is all so well connected not like fucking DS2
[3:13:21] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ok def darksign now lol
[3:13:25] <%trigunstar26> WHAT
[3:13:27] <glass_marcus> or die
[3:13:27] <Yerochan> did not know that
[3:13:28] <+pupil31> I never knew that
[3:13:30] <velgaduere> death is also fine
[3:13:32] <JetpackMcQuack> he'll do it for you
[3:13:32] <%DashXero> Might be more expedient to die.
[3:13:35] <+robertoszek> no darksign required
[3:13:35] <Call_for_Adventure> Just die
[3:13:37] <+セビー> oh right.. thats a thing
[3:13:37] <%IronOhki> Bone!
[3:13:37] <%cobalt_phoenix_> or death too lol

[3:13:41] <agustorm123> The con is back in town
[3:13:44] <velgaduere> or darksign...
[3:13:46] <%CommanderSqueaks> No reentry into Blightcon Reggie!
[3:13:46] <hazeprojekt> just die
[3:13:48] <available_line> teleport through death
[3:13:51] <%IronOhki> Homeward Bone!
[3:13:52] <andre11dr> The Souls that you won't keep
[3:13:55] <peachy996> for the culture souls
[3:13:58] <Johannen> would it drop the souls or just delete them?
[3:14:00] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Darksign doesn't drop, it instantly consumes.
[3:14:01] <%diegobandzz> nice
[3:14:11] <+pupil31> Exercise baby
[3:14:11] <+swesterly> He should repair soon
[3:14:11] <PMda2nd> HSWP
[3:14:12] <+Shishi1205> eats souls and humanities
[3:14:13] <Call_for_Adventure> Love to backtrack
[3:14:18] <BigYanno> nothin wrong with walking. Learn the route.
[3:14:23] <nxflre> wow thanks Reggie lol
[3:14:24] <velgaduere> walking back is fine too, and I feel like there's a ladder he chose not to take
[3:14:26] <%Rafraud> He grinding
[3:14:35] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> I feel like that doesn't happen in 3
[3:14:37] <%cobalt_phoenix_> yea that kinda sucks
[3:14:37] <JetpackMcQuack> the dream of wiping the game state
[3:14:37] <%IronOhki> Bone out!
[3:14:39] <+extradopeness> hell yeah reggie is here to play
[3:14:39] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1457949040566575106?t=WRD3hhRxnZrnVQfqKaaqMA&s=19
[3:14:42] <+Shishi1205> it doesnt
[3:14:44] <agustorm123> Those big boys give good souls
[3:14:45] <%hax_metatron> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ It 100% happens in all their games LUL
[3:14:47] <gulthrax> bone up!
[3:14:49] <Darren716> Uh why doesnt he just bone back?
[3:14:52] <%CommanderSqueaks> @IronOhki Relax, jesus, chat is feral today

[3:14:53] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @hax_metatron sasuga
[3:14:56] <+Shishi1205> again
[3:14:59] <BigYanno> BOOOOOOONEEEEE
[3:14:59] <velgaduere> is 1500 even worth the cost of a bone?
[3:15:02] <%Ensign_Epic> This is 100% the case is what is happening. Go far enough & the game brings everything back even without resting
[3:15:03] <%hax_metatron> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ Just a limitation of the engine
[3:15:06] <+robertoszek> it's a ps3 game after all, too much memory to keep the state of the level from so far
[3:15:10] <+Shishi1205> bone's are 600?
[3:15:11] <gryffinp> Bones are 500 each so yes
[3:15:12] <%IronOhki> @IronOhki I was just bamboozled by the dark sign suggestion.
[3:15:15] <scary_scary> yoooo
[3:15:15] <%hax_metatron> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ It can't remember that much stuff or your game will be crushed
[3:15:15] <%DashXero> Did that cure poison?
[3:15:16] <velgaduere> fair enough
[3:15:16] <%Dakuu75> He doesnt want to bone, he wants to kill
[3:15:22] <+BignanasTheGawd> has he fought the boss yet?
[3:15:25] <JetpackMcQuack> probably a mod for that
[3:15:28] <+extradopeness> nah
[3:15:29] <Monkeyweed21> @BignanasTheGawd not yet

[3:15:46] <Monkeyweed21> all thats left is the cosplayer corner for Blightcon
[3:15:51] <penitentpendant> ...in the poison zone?
[3:15:57] <+askalta> power within rules in this game
[3:15:59] <toulon_somberjade> using homeward counts as resting at a bonfire
[3:16:13] <Monkeyweed21> @andre11dr climbing back up from the catacombs is awful tho

[3:31:31] <andre11dr> So the first time i played, i totally swung on that dude
[3:31:37] <+Bitscreed> I've been gone for about an hour or so. What did I miss?
[3:31:40] <KeiganOfAstora> I have it on in the background so can't hear everything

[3:31:53] <Slim_Lipid> @Bitscreed quelaag jobbing

[3:31:54] <%A_German_spy> @andre11dr Most people do on their first playthroughs. Same mentality as Reggie: shoot first, ask later.
[3:31:54] <%Grimlockfly> @Bitscreed reggie one shotted spider woman
[3:32:01] <+Bitscreed> Nice!
[3:32:11] <agustorm123> Keloggs was a hard boss, Reggie level up with the stray demon
[3:32:16] <%IronOhki> @A_German_spy huh.
[3:32:23] <%A_German_spy> @andre11dr And in fairness, Fromsoft does you dirty by making an NPC look exactly like a regular enemy.
[3:32:29] <@Menitta> Is spider woman a generally strong boss?
[3:32:33] <andre11dr> I was ,huh wierd, why did THAT ONE talk ? LUL
[3:32:43] <nxflre> @Menitta yeahh her AOE kills
[3:32:52] <%A_German_spy> @Menitta Depends when you fight her. Early on, she can be a wall. With decent weapons, not quite as bad.
[3:32:53] <Jaysky> She's kind of strong but it's really RNG based
[3:32:53] <+RyTYoung> I wonder...if Reggie will encounter the 2nd worst boss tonight Kappa
[3:33:01] <Estuko> @Menitta she has moves that ctatches players off guard like an explosive AOE and her lava
[3:33:10] <+liquidzr0> danHmm
[3:33:13] <agustorm123> @menitta kinda
[3:33:14] <%Josef_Stryker> Did Quelaag ever do the explosion?
[3:33:15] <andre11dr> @a_german_spy So did you get in on that Elden Ring?
[3:33:21] <Jaysky> How much lava she drops and her positioning depends highly on difficult
[3:33:27] <Jaysky> *difficulty
[3:33:28] <%A_German_spy> @andre11dr The network test? Yeah.
[3:33:32] <%esoteric_simp> im pretty sure queelag did the explosion when reggie ran away
[3:33:39] <%CommanderSqueaks> Reggie having ranged options also helped
[3:33:45] <%WangTang_> WangTang_ subscribed with Prime. 
[3:33:46] <bobxmaker> that titanite catch pole doing work, i mean luck is a real stat.
[3:33:46] <andre11dr> @a_german_spy Welp ,how was it?
[3:33:46] <%DashXero> Reggie beat that with pure fundamentals.
[3:33:52] <@Menitta> Interesting
[3:34:03] <+oz_suka> Will Reggie be ready by the time Elden ring drops?

[3:34:27] <nxflre> @A_German_spy concerns?

[3:34:47] <+extradopeness> think that pig hat is on a bit too tight
[3:34:48] <JetpackMcQuack> we'll find a weakness
[3:34:53] <%A_German_spy> @nxflre Boss and strong enemy design, mainly.
[3:34:54] <scarman125> my one concern was that it would be too much like Sekiro but that doesn't seem to be the case.

[3:36:31] <agustorm123> 3 hours and 43 minutes to do blight con
[3:36:33] <scarman125> after Laurence I have a hard time believe they can do worse than that when it comes to boss design.
[3:36:36] <andre11dr> Looking at you DKS3 magic
[3:37:04] <scarman125> as someone who liked Str/Faith builds seeing both nerfed to death in DS3 hurt
[3:37:07] <%A_German_spy> @andre11dr I worry about that too as a matter of course, since Fromsoft has a pattern of it.
[3:37:32] <%A_German_spy> @andre11dr That said, I also see some improvements in how NPC summons work in ER.
[3:37:46] <%Josef_Stryker> I know it won't be for a while, but I hope Reggie enjoys DS2
[3:37:52] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Welcome back.

[3:42:06] <LunarRemix> Chaos is like supreme fire
[3:42:06] <%CateHecate> it is Chaos Flame
[3:42:08] <+Amaideus> The "fire" on her is literally demonic script
[3:42:10] <BadGoodTime> Fire + Dark, right?
[3:42:10] <DSD24> "You mean the chaos emeralds?"
[3:42:10] <Visorak6> Chaos flame
[3:42:13] <velgaduere> chaos is basically soulfire

[3:42:24] <DeathByPoke7> even further beyond
[3:42:25] <PMda2nd> it ascends fire
[3:42:26] <+askalta> fire that scales with humanity

[3:42:32] <+Reverend_Roscoe> oh damn

[3:42:42] <agustorm123> Chaoooooos
[3:42:43] <PMda2nd> like a soul fire?
[3:42:44] <%CateHecate> Chaos is an extension of pyromancy which is essentially the fire of life gone out of control. Think life that is so crazy that it is cancerous growth.

[3:57:37] <+Shishi1205> @Solidus_113 why?
[3:57:39] <@Solidus_113> or no wait
[3:57:45] <@Solidus_113> I'm thinking of later
[3:57:46] <%Dakuu75> Tell us Vati-Woolie
[3:57:48] <@Solidus_113> nvm
[3:57:52] <kulmoth> he doesn't have THE soul, its fine
[3:57:54] <%PenGia> Yeah he's fine for now
[3:57:54] <%Lion_kun> Oh wait no he doesn't, Lautrec took the other.
[3:57:56] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Killed Quelaag, very nice
[3:57:57] <penitentpendant> @Solidus_113 Why? The Anor Londo soul is in Anor Londo
[3:57:57] <%hax_metatron> It’s also the reason the bonfire is already kindled and has 10 Estua
[3:57:57] <+RemedyofRevenge> they do not have two souls yet, they gotta reclaim the other one
[3:57:58] <federleicht> guys he doesnt have the shrine soul
[3:58:00] <@Solidus_113> lautrec has the soul
[3:58:02] <%Dakuu75> So, why is she so fucked up?
[3:58:03] <+Shishi1205> Its fine to give the soul
[3:58:03] <%mr_sups> You get the real one later with the ORB
[3:58:04] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Solidus_113 yea he gets THAT one after
[3:58:07] <+Krasmeyts> Now Solidus has become nutty. Chat is contagious.
[3:58:07] <justcallmebobplease> You need 30 for THE THING
[3:58:13] <%Lion_kun> It would be so funny if he accidentally gave the wrong soul though haha
[3:58:17] <%Rafraud> Oh ok thought it was the other one
[3:58:19] <agustorm123> Why is she a fire keeper but she is fucked up?
[3:58:22] <+Shishi1205> 30 yeah
[3:58:23] <LunarRemix> 10 and 30
[3:58:29] <Darren716> 10 is one level, and then another 20 for the other
[3:58:30] <Visorak6> 30 also gets a pyromancy
[3:58:31] <justcallmebobplease> It'll also give THE STRONGEST AOE PYROMANCY
[3:58:32] <+セビー> all firekeepers are messed up
[3:58:33] <Admiral_PopnFresh> or...INVADE
[3:58:34] <%DashXero> 30 humanity is cheap.
[3:58:38] <+Shishi1205> btw in the remaster you can give it in bulks
[3:58:39] <%mr_sups> Or go PVPing
[3:58:40] <%Lion_kun> murder those rats
[3:58:45] <agustorm123> Not this much tho
[3:58:45] <Banish55> rats are a good source
[3:58:46] <shieldanvil> the payoff is not doing izalith. well worth it
[3:58:46] <+pabloelenano2> @agustorm123  humanity+witche of izzalith
[3:58:47] <%Lion_kun> or go to the dlc area
[3:58:47] <AbnormalVoid> it's fastest to get humanity in the DLC
[3:58:48] <+Bitscreed> I believe Reggie has a total of 20 hard and soft humanity on him already.
[3:58:49] <Darren716> You'll easily get 30 via pickups
[3:58:53] <%Rafraud> Check the pyromancy
[3:58:59] <blackpegaso> Save the sun bro!!
[3:59:00] <QueequegTheater> Or you can commence thuggery
[3:59:01] <+extradopeness> but you CANT join a different covenant during the process or it RESTARTS
[3:59:05] <%hax_metatron> Just have someone drop you some humanity easy
[3:59:10] <JetpackMcQuack> save the fire
[3:59:10] <gulthrax> Maiden Astraea in spoder form
[3:59:10] <+Bitscreed> Like 19 hard humanity in his inventory and that one soft one
[3:59:11] <Admiral_PopnFresh> little gnawing, writhing creatures
[3:59:13] <subjectg> murder rats or murder babies, take your pick
[3:59:14] <+athuramn> she chose to become a fire keeper to keep the plague from spreading and be a repository for humanity
[3:59:16] <%Lion_kun> do NOT join another covenant or it resets
[3:59:21] <gryffinp> woolie realized as he was saying it that it didn't actually make sense
[3:59:24] <chainsaw105> remember spending like 20 minutes popping each individual humanity in the OG version? I SURE DO

[4:00:31] <%Juriasu> 8 legs are 4 timer more chaotic than 2
[4:00:33] <+Amaideus> Friendly reminder, no demons encountered are crazy
[4:00:36] <%amaranthos> The fact that all of this is hidden behind an easily missable illusory wall is fucking psychotic
[4:00:36] <%Indigo_Automaton> I guess it's because Spiders and Trees share similarities, Legs/Branches
[4:00:43] <%cobalt_phoenix_> no

[4:00:58] <%vivaciouseff> the soul from Blighttown is fine to use
[4:00:59] <+cdrom321> Reinforce.
[4:00:59] <+RemedyofRevenge> @WoolieVersus not with this one, its the one that Lautrec has that you need to save for Firelink
[4:01:00] <Banish55> do it
[4:01:00] <+alphonseisbest> do it
[4:01:00] <penitentpendant> He should upgrade. Some people were panicking about the Anor Londo soul.
[4:01:00] <QueequegTheater> Safe right now
[4:01:00] <%CommanderSqueaks> No, Solidus was worried that you had the FireKeeper soul, but Reggie doesn't have it yet @WoolieVersus
[4:01:01] <BadGoodTime> this one is all good to use
[4:01:01] <BigYanno> ur gud

[4:01:05] <%scrumbotime> Lautrec has the soul you need
[4:01:06] <+MoxaHaunt> That soul is ok to burn
[4:01:07] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @WoolieVersus people are confusing it with the later one
[4:01:07] <%Irridium> They probably thought it was Firelink's soul
[4:01:08] <MuddBox> there is only one fire keeper soul you need to keep safe
[4:01:09] <+BignanasTheGawd> its safe, just make sure in anor londo

[4:02:08] <velgaduere> and even if there is a problem, IT'S FINE
[4:02:09] <PMda2nd> I'm confused

[4:02:23] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Yeah, why do people think keeper soul is THE ONE?
[4:02:23] <+Shishi1205> one of two
[4:02:30] <Equirah> ... he had two souls, which one did he use?
[4:02:31] <MeImoth> good old "OneGuy" permanent blight on all streams

[4:02:48] <+athuramn> one guy has many powers, sometimes he disguises himself as  just a guy, sometimes it's a mod @hiswill98 KEKW
[4:02:53] <+pabloelenano2> @Equirah  no.... just dont
[4:02:53] <%CappuccinoGuil> @Admiral_PopnFresh because they thought he picked it up at her cage AND firekeeper souls' having the same name and icon is stupid LUL
[4:02:56] <T_Doobie> c'mon chat, it's an honest mistake to make
[4:02:57] <vnzuelandude> Yo that bell
[4:03:01] <%Juriasu> guessing woolieONEGUY spent the wrong fire keeper soul here once and assumed it's always a bad idea no matter what
[4:03:01] <andre11dr> @woolieversus Remind him to atone the Chaos Orb if he forgets
[4:03:09] <+Shishi1205> huh

[4:03:22] <VAYETEAS> Did PAIGE kill those NPCs?
[4:03:24] <%debrv> OH THAT'S DARK.

[4:03:24] <%patriotrenegade> Im pretty sure thats true, at least thats what Plague said in his LP
[4:03:25] <KeiganOfAstora> PREGGERS
[4:03:25] <+Amaideus> The corpses are all the default model
[4:03:26] <+DenpaDev> babies
[4:03:27] <%Indigo_Automaton> Pregnant women, yeah
[4:03:27] <Neo_Kyon> bawkFace bawkHands
[4:03:29] <Estuko> NotLikeThis I don't really like that

[4:03:31] <available_line> I didn't... know that...
[4:03:31] <%vivaciouseff> twin drops from Gargoyles as well
[4:03:32] <+vaderxyz1970> I did not need to know thar
[4:03:32] <+Shishi1205> Are the gargoyles women? @WoolieVersus
[4:03:32] <KeiganOfAstora> Yea, because pregnan
[4:03:32] <pi_in_the_sci> Quelaag gives you a twin
[4:03:33] <Jontman42> flesh mechs
[4:03:33] <%CommanderSqueaks> Woolie, it means there were two souls in there :)
[4:03:34] <%trigunstar26> FUUUUUK
[4:03:35] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @CappuccinoGuil yeah, but's its obvious it wouldn't be at the cage...HE would have it
[4:03:36] <+athuramn> yeah, it is, it's an honest mistake and if it were to happen, then it'd be a playthrough destroyer so better to be safe
[4:03:37] <saddest_man> Incredible
[4:03:38] <vnzuelandude> Pregante?
[4:03:39] <+eanscrale> Neat!
[4:03:41] <DianaTheAscian> Paige has been working hard I see
[4:03:41] <smitty_warben_jagerman> oh no
[4:03:42] <%Irridium> That's Dark (Souls)
[4:03:43] <%hiswill98> You also get Twin Humanity from Gargoyles but that makes sense
[4:03:46] <%Feralspirit41> Why are ladies so eager to smash before they go undead
[4:03:46] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:03:49] <KeiganOfAstora> Neir Pregante
[4:03:53] <%Pillagius> Boobs contain humanity - confirmed
[4:03:55] <+NYCrownlessKing> pregnant? monkaS
[4:03:55] <JetpackMcQuack> too much detail miyazaki
[4:03:57] <+Malysitos> Pregananant?!
[4:04:01] <BigYanno> you can a sick weapon with quelaag's soul
[4:04:01] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Feralspirit41 Who said anything about before?
[4:04:03] <%CateHecate> paige has own covenant where she hunts down VVymyn
[4:04:03] <%amaranthos> humanity is stored in the breast
[4:04:09] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> maybe because only women can become firekeepers?
[4:04:10] <SixthShinx> Makes it weird that you can have Twin Humanites are your starting gift
[4:04:10] <penitentpendant> Triple Humanity would be real awkward to find
[4:04:16] <%CappuccinoGuil> @Admiral_PopnFresh It's a reasonable mistake, it's fine, people forgot the order of things here, it happens.
[4:04:19] <gulthrax> humanity stored in the cullo
[4:04:32] <nxflre> Do everythign
[4:04:39] <+alphonseisbest> @penitentpendant one for each ball
[4:04:41] <+Chamapa_Stys> humanity's stored in the lungs, remember?
[4:04:45] <andre11dr> Can the undead even have children?
[4:04:47] <%CateHecate> im gonna POOOOOOMP
[4:04:53] <%DegenCat> humanitee is stored in the balls
[4:04:59] <+Shishi1205> @andre11dr no clue this is not bloodborne
[4:05:01] <+alphonseisbest> ^
[4:05:08] <penitentpendant> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ To a degree, it makes sense that only women could be fire keepers. Naturally able to contain more than one soul. (As awkward as that thought is)
[4:05:51] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @penitentpendant perhaps our lord and savior Miyazaki knows
[4:05:53] <%DashXero> Is this the remaster or original?
[4:06:00] <stevenellis386> upgrade dat bitch
[4:06:01] <available_line> remaster
[4:06:02] <Klefth> Remaster
[4:06:04] <+TopTieramisu> ds3 kinda retcons what hollows are so by ds3's rules, i think hollows can have children
[4:06:04] <+Shishi1205> re
[4:06:04] <+athuramn> @penitentpendant ngl, I never thought of it like that, that's kinda neat
[4:06:08] <%DashXero> Thanks, guys!
[4:06:28] <+Shishi1205> only one can ascend the hand
[4:06:52] <Admiral_PopnFresh> thats a good looking flame
[4:06:55] <agustorm123> DS3 lore retcons a lot of things
[4:07:00] <MeImoth> +10 pyromancy flame is a important thing
[4:07:04] <%Indigo_Automaton> Nice
[4:07:05] <SheefEatsBeef> poppin soulz
[4:07:13] <subjectg> We have any more to upgrade the catch pole?

[4:07:47] <+Shishi1205> its 12k last upgrade
[4:07:47] <Klefth> Combustion always slaps
[4:07:49] <subjectg> @shishi1205 there are those lizards in the great hollow?
[4:07:50] <+Shishi1205> I think
[4:07:52] <+セビー> only easy way to find twinkling would need a trip to the tree/lake
[4:07:58] <Klefth> +9 does the trick
[4:07:59] <%hax_metatron> NO +10
[4:07:59] <Visorak6> Unsure
[4:08:02] <+セビー> (from here anyway)
[4:08:03] <OblivionSword1> check the wiki
[4:08:09] <+Shishi1205> Wiki says 10
[4:08:10] <+alphonseisbest> +10 yes
[4:08:12] <%debrv> +10.
[4:08:14] <+cdrom321> I could swear +10.
[4:08:14] <+extradopeness> it Has to be +10
[4:08:16] <glass_marcus> +9 seems like a weird place for it to be
[4:08:19] <SarcFa> I mean it's an easy confirmation, +9 it check, if not there, +10
[4:08:19] <Klefth> Well shit, mb
[4:08:21] <%DegenCat> time tor i s e and g r i n d

[4:09:05] <%Grimlockfly> get it reggie
[4:09:10] <%CappuccinoGuil> Need 2 slots for it
[4:09:16] <+Shishi1205> all chaos spells need 2 slots
[4:09:23] <%hax_metatron> Woolie: Fun fact: The conditions for Quelaana to appear were one of the biggest unsolved mysterious in DS1 for a long, long, long time.  Even now, you'll have people say they appeared to her without meeting the +10 requirement, but there's never any proof.
[4:09:23] <subjectg> Get rid of mist and combustion
[4:09:28] <Darren716> She didnt find it
[4:09:30] <Darren716> She was given it
[4:09:34] <%Lion_kun> I went to the the lake to max out my BKS on my strength run
[4:09:45] <+Shishi1205> @hax_metatron invaders with +10 flames
[4:09:46] <%Lion_kun> Went to Anor Londo with a +5 BKS haha
[4:09:47] <nxflre> @hax_metatron could be someone they summoned that had it
[4:09:53] <andre11dr> That is a great spell.,get rid of Combustion if you have to
[4:09:56] <agustorm123> The chaos
[4:09:58] <penitentpendant> @hax_metatron If a person is invited for jolly cooperation HAS a +10 (Or invaders) it triggers too
[4:09:59] <vnzuelandude> Hey man those Witches were HOT
[4:10:03] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus No, there's no self-damage from this spell
[4:10:06] <%trigunstar26> no you're immune
[4:10:09] <andre11dr> No
[4:10:09] <+セビー> the lake would be a hell of a shock considering reggie hasnt been in the basin yet
[4:10:10] <chainsaw105> in my current run I ran into her without a +10 pyro glove and I have no idea how
[4:10:14] <Call_for_Adventure> @hax_metatron If someone with +10 flame invades or is summoned by you, that counts too, I think
[4:10:20] <MrMatternot> Go get a headworm
[4:10:24] <Call_for_Adventure> oops, sorry
[4:10:26] <Call_for_Adventure> Dupe
[4:10:31] <GeneralHysterics> this is a dramatically different reggie than I last saw, WOW

[4:24:58] <SoaringTrumpet> @gryffinp interesting you kinda blew my mind now
[4:25:00] <+anoldtoilet> the fight is extremely hard and not fun
[4:25:00] <glass_marcus> it's a boring fight, woolie made the right call
[4:25:01] <+anoldtoilet> yeah
[4:25:02] <subjectg> the fight is really easy so whatever
[4:25:04] <chainsaw105> Woolie the Cheater stole everyone's money
[4:25:04] <+ReallyBigRocks> lava is basically rock cum, take it from me, an expert
[4:25:05] <+alphonseisbest> This is WAAAAY better then the fight
[4:25:06] <Scrapl> @gryf youre not the only one who doesnt immediately think of gross stuff from discharge
[4:25:07] <counterfeitgimmicks> @tank7013 There's a bug where he doesn't jump at you but just stumbles off the cliff
[4:25:07] <@Solidus_113> That set is fucking good too
[4:25:10] <GeneralHysterics> the fight isn't that good, you right
[4:25:10] <+Shishi1205> fight is bad this is better
[4:25:11] <andiwaffles> tru
[4:25:11] <+athuramn> absolutely the right call
[4:25:12] <+irontoast29> it was a good call
[4:25:12] <Equirah> you could just say that *after* the fight LUL
[4:25:14] <+Shishi1205> SET BANGS
[4:25:16] <BigYanno> the fight is kinda shit
[4:25:16] <OneThousandTomatoes> CHAOS
[4:25:19] <%tank7013> @RyTYoung That's the whole game though
[4:25:21] <+mase_210> @mase_210 Real DS players cheese it out
[4:25:23] <GeneralHysterics> nazgul set fuckin' rules tho
[4:25:23] <youngking_kush> This fight sucks anyway
[4:25:25] <%cobalt_phoenix_> BEST SET
[4:25:26] <+twohitgood> you stole his dead sister's clothes off her corpse.
[4:25:29] <subjectg> The set is really good but it’s also the most basic bitch shit
[4:25:31] <Johannen> Woolie was just fixing the bets, nothing wrong with a little cheating
[4:25:35] <Zebroneath> it's a good lightweight set
[4:25:35] <%Ensign_Epic> This set is unironically one of the best sets in the game. Fantastic defenses for weight
[4:25:39] <andiwaffles> nice item description lore hunting, reggie :)
[4:25:40] <+irontoast29> stripSad you stole
[4:25:41] <agustorm123> Chaos is a ladder
[4:25:45] <Major_Monotone> Best helmet and torso in the game, easily
[4:25:56] <BigYanno> I like to call the fair lady Quelath
[4:25:58] <counterfeitgimmicks> Gold-Hemmed set OP
[4:26:00] <OneThousandTomatoes> "Mom"
[4:26:00] <+Jiggisnipe> and a son Kappa
[4:26:01] <subjectg> “Chaos is restless”
[4:26:03] <AbnormalVoid> one of the best sets in the game
[4:26:04] <%hax_metatron> Ceaseless Discharge was the son, and was warped by the chaos flame. He was overlooking his sister's corpse.
[4:26:06] <nxflre> it was the mods that maadee the bet no? Not woolie?
[4:26:14] <DianaTheAscian> oh they announced the announcement date for the next strive character
[4:26:14] <youngking_kush> That's Big Mom
[4:26:14] <OldManDeckardCain> reggie is already asking for her onlyfans LUL

[4:26:33] <BigYanno> my girl predates gwyns rule
[4:26:33] <%CateHecate> so i guess they could make clothes down in the grey lands?
[4:26:34] <%CommanderSqueaks> Always simp
[4:26:38] <%Ensign_Epic> just stole from a dude's dead sister & then killed him for daring to care
[4:26:42] <+swesterly> Cope and seethe nonbelievers
[4:26:43] <MinersLoveGames> Damn, I missed most of the stream.
[4:26:44] <%Ensign_Epic> Dark Souls is ruthless like that
[4:26:46] <+vaderxyz1970> How's it feel Seeth
[4:26:58] <Treasure_Vault> You should rewatch the intro cutscene every time the game starts, tbh
[4:27:04] <+Sir_Louis> AND NOW ITS YOUR NEW DRIP
[4:27:10] <MeImoth> @WoolieVersus btw this is THE value "low weight but high def" set of the game, not that Reggie is going for low weight at the moment
[4:27:13] <+extradopeness> From the Dark They Came
[4:27:29] <velgaduere> that hood is dope
[4:27:30] <+Shishi1205> best light armor / robes yeah
[4:27:36] <%BisoromiBear> glove up
[4:27:47] <@Moobot> Please don't fill up the entire chat, @agustorm123
[4:27:50] <BigYanno> there's more lore to come. The Izalith lore is fuckin DOPE
[4:27:51] <Johannen> @Treasure_Vault I think that takes away from the suprise and discovery, cause DS3 was kinda obvious...these dudes are the bosses, this is more epic and legend
[4:27:57] <MrMatternot> More lore after caterpillar
[4:27:57] <%Solidnick18> fun times down there
[4:28:12] <agustorm123> The Witch of Izalith was one of the Lords, the four beings who discovered the manifestations of disparity near the First Flame.
[4:28:13] <KyberNasse> Party zone
[4:28:14] <BigYanno> and if you pan juuuuuuust up from that capra demon
[4:28:17] <%hax_metatron> The discharge stopped.
[4:28:18] <+Bitscreed> But who are those bois in the distance?
[4:28:22] <GeneralHysterics> I love the popoff of early zone bosses being basic enemies now
[4:28:28] <chainsaw105> mouse dropped bull men
[4:28:29] <andre11dr> I remember reading somewhere that Ceaseless is supposed to be her brother and the only male from the original pyros
[4:28:30] <%Solidnick18> just take a peek
[4:28:31] <+athuramn> I thought the npc you meet is quelana, not the witch of izalith
[4:28:33] <GeneralHysterics> Just a pack of fellas
[4:28:35] <velgaduere> ARMY OF BOY
[4:28:36] <+Shishi1205> POSTED UP BOIS

[4:28:52] <penitentpendant> Copy and Past Bois
[4:28:54] <+Shishi1205> @WoolieVersus farm for the pyro flame upgrade
[4:28:55] <dundore77> the tree fifty zone
[4:28:56] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @stevenellis386
[4:28:57] <Johannen> Woolie cannot contain himself)

[4:39:34] <%Ensign_Epic> @subjectg actually, Mask of the Mother is the meta mask. Extra HP OP
[4:39:35] <slix3431> Eager Reggie runs the wrong way
[4:39:39] <+alphonseisbest> chat is the message system an thing other NPC can see in lore?
[4:39:46] <+anoldtoilet> yeah alphonse
[4:39:47] <+pectusumbra> make sure he kills those fucks so they don't kill the NPC
[4:39:57] <+Grayhammatter> gotta kill those fucks
[4:40:01] <%Rafoki> don't you have to be human? I cannot remeber
[4:40:02] <jett_eyes> @alphonseisbest most likely
[4:40:02] <+anoldtoilet> the messages are part of the time + space compression thing, you write them and they appear in other worlds in lore too
[4:40:03] <+Shishi1205> the zone is enemy invisible
[4:40:03] <+vaderxyz1970> Be very careful do not swing
[4:40:05] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Kill everything else around
[4:40:05] <Visorak6> Not if they see you first
[4:40:18] <%Ensign_Epic> SHOULD. It is SHOULD. DO NOT RELY ON THE BUG AI TO WORK PROPERLY
[4:40:18] <+Shishi1205> its the zone where she is
[4:40:21] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> kell everyone who has seen you, otherwise yeah
[4:40:24] <%Irridium> @Rafoki nah
[4:40:24] <GeneralHysterics> quelana has a zone that the bugs cannot enter
[4:40:25] <Guerrillasaurus> the stone boys will stay aggro on you
[4:40:26] <+Shishi1205> not talking to her specifically
[4:40:31] <GeneralHysterics> even when she's not visible
[4:40:34] <%Ensign_Epic> If they see you before entering the area, they still are aggro'd to you
[4:40:41] <+anoldtoilet> its the one on the left actually i think
[4:40:45] <penitentpendant> To invoke the pun: The Bug AI can be Buggy. Don't rely on it if you're pre-spotted.
[4:40:46] <Johannen> Not the closest
[4:40:46] <OblivionSword1> I see the person in question
[4:40:55] <%Ensign_Epic> Quelana's AoE only impacts you if you have not yet been seen
[4:40:56] <+Shishi1205> its the left one
[4:40:59] <youngking_kush> To the left
[4:41:09] <%hax_metatron> Just run to her, quit / reload.  Everyone gets reset.  Victory.
[4:41:12] <SunsetJack> I would go to the bonfire but eh.
[4:41:14] <%Ensign_Epic> @penitentpendant Gorgeous
[4:41:21] <%Ensign_Epic> @hax_metatron This is the best answer
[4:41:22] <+anoldtoilet> jesus thats big backstab damage
[4:41:23] <%Solidnick18> right in the ass
[4:41:25] <GeneralHysterics> right in the GRUNDLE
[4:41:32] <%hax_metatron> @Ensign_Epic Now we're thinking with Dark Souls
[4:41:33] <+Grayhammatter> right in the crack
[4:41:34] <AngryAsian5> Right up the pooper
[4:41:43] <PMda2nd> use to be hard now you're just wet and soft
[4:41:45] <+Shishi1205> they can chuck the stones
[4:41:47] <+Shishi1205> so not safe
[4:41:47] <GeneralHysterics> we grundle gamers now
[4:41:49] <andre11dr> Reggie just trow ONE fireball
[4:41:50] <%trigunstar26> yeah it is
[4:41:56] <%trigunstar26> just hallwug
[4:41:57] <mar_krow> Poop stick
[4:42:00] <penitentpendant> Slow and steady, speed run strats are for a personal playthrough later
[4:42:00] <+Jiggisnipe> whiff
[4:42:03] <+anoldtoilet> stability
[4:42:03] <%Solidnick18> FIYA BALL
[4:42:06] <glass_marcus> it's fine if you don't aggro them by hugging the wall
[4:42:07] <MinersLoveGames> erring on the side of caution is ALWAYS a good strategy in Dark Souls.
[4:42:08] <youngking_kush> You get away with just killing the left one reliably
[4:42:10] <+anoldtoilet> thats why you need a high stability shield
[4:42:11] <%Ensign_Epic> @hax_metatron I used to be so dead set against it too before the ash lake hydra sorta hollowed me XD
[4:42:11] <stevenellis386> someone call the SVU cuz that man got violated
[4:42:11] <+anoldtoilet> lol
[4:42:30] <agustorm123> imagine that LUL
[4:42:36] <penitentpendant> @stevenellis386 It's just the shape of that weapon makes the backstab so much worse
[4:42:37] <+Shishi1205> there she is
[4:42:37] <PMda2nd> that would be great
[4:42:37] <%hax_metatron> @Ensign_Epic I don't fight Bed of Chaos without quit/reload anymore.  Quitting/reloading that fight actually makes it doable in one try
[4:42:42] <+anoldtoilet> ooofff
[4:42:43] <+Shishi1205> left pillar
[4:42:52] <+anoldtoilet> lol hitbox porn...
[4:42:55] <LoreKeeper_Thal> YOU THOUGHT
[4:42:56] <+swesterly> Damn son where’d you find this
[4:43:06] <dundore77> man that pole just gets right up in there
[4:43:11] <stevenellis386> some cue the law and order sound
[4:43:11] <+anoldtoilet> pickaxe is OP
[4:43:11] <+Shishi1205> wow
[4:43:15] <+TheFrancix> YOOOOO
[4:43:17] <agustorm123> DAMN
[4:43:18] <LunarRemix> Pickaxe is a rare drop
[4:43:19] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> minecraft time
[4:43:20] <WoawDesu> Minecraft time
[4:43:20] <+anoldtoilet> great hammer thrust weapon
[4:43:21] <%sewermonk> I might be dumb but I just realized the polecatcher moveset it just the titanite demon's moveset?
[4:43:21] <Darren716> Pickaxe is a thing?
[4:43:24] <nxflre> another rare drop!
[4:43:26] <%Ensign_Epic> @hax_metatron Agreed. Still manage to have the WORST luck with the branch jump
[4:43:27] <+Bitscreed> I didn't even know that was a weapon in this game!
[4:43:28] <agustorm123> HE IS THE MASTERS OF DROPS
[4:43:29] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Wow. That's a mundane weapon, but a VERY rare drop from these guys.
[4:43:31] <GeneralHysterics> bugs lmao
[4:43:41] <Klefth> But soul arrow tho
[4:43:42] <willsin4fun> pole seems more like a pitch pole than a catch pole
[4:43:42] <+Shishi1205> 2% reggie again
[4:43:43] <+anoldtoilet> its actually the one on the left
[4:43:52] <+Shishi1205> left pillar
[4:43:59] <justcallmebobplease> I love how often Reggie looks dead at something and is totally blind.
[4:44:03] <GeneralHysterics> There she is!
[4:44:15] <Deko_> monkaS
[4:44:16] <GeneralHysterics> Quelana is so great
[4:44:19] <+hax_metatron> WAIFU
[4:44:21] <%Ensign_Epic> @A_German_spy It's really not. 2% is fairly generous for some of these items

[4:46:08] <%A_German_spy> By the gods, fear it, Reggarth
[4:46:19] <Dave_VD> She is best sister
[4:46:20] <electrum_chariot> What weapon is Reggie using? I don’t recognize it.
[4:46:23] <seydaq> is she alive? thought she was some sort of spirit
[4:46:26] <Visorak6> Catch pole.
[4:46:29] <%A_German_spy> @electrum_chariot Titanite Catch Pole
[4:46:29] <leomuratore> THE Pyromancer
[4:46:34] <+athuramn> @swesterly I thought that was only dusk
[4:46:35] <youngking_kush> OG TRIPLE OG
[4:46:35] <ManfredA> @electrum_chariot Titanite Catch Pole, the weapon of titanite demons
[4:46:37] <sirrice77> @electrum_chariot titanite catch pole, rare drop from titanite demons
[4:46:44] <penitentpendant> She's the stall with no one in line in Blight Con.
[4:46:44] <+extradopeness> everywhere that she go aint the same as before
[4:46:46] <mar_krow> Pyro 4 life

[4:46:52] <+Grayhammatter> FIRESTORM
[4:46:54] <justcallmebobplease> F I R E S T O R M
[4:46:58] <Deko_> yeyeye PogChamp
[4:47:00] <AbnormalVoid> Great Combustion Kreygasm
[4:47:01] <+Shishi1205> Great chaos firestorm tho
[4:47:02] <SoaringTrumpet> bloody expensive
[4:47:03] <%Indigo_Automaton> LUL  Firewhip
[4:47:03] <PhazonSuited> firestorm is so messed up in this game
[4:47:04] <%Solidnick18> FIRESTORM
[4:47:05] <%cobalt_phoenix_> most of there aren't worth it
[4:47:07] <QueequegTheater> Fire whip is unfortunately trash
[4:47:07] <%cobalt_phoenix_> imo
[4:47:12] <Deko_> ULTIMATE
[4:47:12] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Rappor hell yeah silent t
[4:47:22] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Great combustion is the best
[4:47:25] <KyberNasse> GREAT BALLS OF FIRE
[4:47:26] <Gorillawitz> I see he's rockin the first-playthrough fashion. He only needs the claymore LUL
[4:47:29] <+Grayhammatter> fire whip is garbage sadly
[4:47:34] <CommanderCOOL> fire whip is trash just like the one in ESO
[4:47:36] <mar_krow> Chaos firestorms
[4:47:36] <stevenellis386> firestorm is fun
[4:47:37] <+Bitscreed> If I could shoot giant lava bombs from my hands I'd adore fire too.
[4:47:38] <Awesome_Leaf> 20 uses Kappa
[4:47:45] <%cobalt_phoenix_> the queelag one is better
[4:47:46] <Dave_VD> I’ve never seen someone use the catch pile before, it seems cool. Good choice
[4:47:48] <+Shishi1205> 30 humanity for the chaos version
[4:47:49] <MinersLoveGames> I didn't start getting into pyromancy until midway through my first playthrough, and it was dope.
[4:47:52] <+anoldtoilet> fire whip is pretty good iirc just very situational and probably not as good as others
[4:47:54] <jorniev> what was the best one?
[4:47:58] <andre11dr> Sadly you already have the best orb spell
[4:47:59] <+anoldtoilet> its actually pretty sick looking woolie
[4:48:00] <a_mad_dragon_> the uses number is such a lie LUL
[4:48:01] <%Solidnick18> no
[4:48:02] <tozs_> LUL
[4:48:06] <%Indigo_Automaton> IT should be
[4:48:06] <AbnormalVoid> it's a flamethrower
[4:48:08] <+Grayhammatter> no, no it is not
[4:48:09] <Darren716> It's a flamethrower basically
[4:48:12] <+cdrom321> It's a flame stream.
[4:48:13] <DeathByPoke7> more like fire sprinkler
[4:48:13] <@Solidus_113> yeah it's a flamethrower
[4:48:14] <+pectusumbra> I mean can always grind and try it
[4:48:16] <JetpackMcQuack> spurt
[4:48:17] <LunarRemix> It's a shitty flamethrower
[4:48:18] <MeImoth> its a continous flamethrower
[4:48:18] <+studleydoorite> fire little spurt
[4:48:22] <%Indigo_Automaton> It's just a wavy flamethrower
[4:48:23] <jorniev> SHOULD have been the balrog whip
[4:48:27] <andre11dr> OROCHINAGI
[4:48:28] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Fire Whip in these games is always disappointing BibleThump
[4:48:37] <seydaq> orichinagi ftw
[4:48:40] <cheapdoc> They didn't have the technology back in the day
[4:48:42] <+SkyfireHero> It hits pretty hard on some bosses
[4:48:49] <Deko_> LUL
[4:48:49] <ManfredA> Undead Rapport is pretty funny
[4:48:49] <wqorst> ?
[4:48:50] <+Awkward_Cyborg> this spell is very useful
[4:48:51] <Dave_VD> Combustion straight up Fireball Justu
[4:48:52] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ?
[4:48:53] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[4:48:57] <+ReallyBigRocks> wow so progressive
[4:48:58] <MeImoth> the Chaos Firewhip can do very high dps in some situations
[4:48:58] <%hax_metatron> IT WORKS
[4:48:59] <+Shishi1205> I use that in ds3
[4:48:59] <velgaduere> enbies cannot use this spell doodSad
[4:49:05] <%Indigo_Automaton> Fire in their LOINS
[4:49:08] <Darren716> Wait Rapport
[4:49:12] <andre11dr> I didn't know Bill Cosby was a pyromancer
[4:49:30] <+pectusumbra> did reggie get fire within?
[4:49:32] <available_line> She burned the archtrees.
[4:49:33] <ManfredA> she is best girl for a reason
[4:49:39] <penitentpendant> It's kinda sad. One of the Dev's has a stall setup in Blightcon, yet nobody's lined up.
[4:49:39] <%WerdIce> Unfortunately the charmed enemies don't move from their spot, so you have to kite them to other enemies
[4:49:44] <%CateHecate> and a big pole
[4:49:50] <andiwaffles> its so annoying how the mosquitoes follow you when you're trying to chat to her
[4:49:51] <youngking_kush> @woolieversus Tell Reggie to look up
[4:49:52] <+Grayhammatter> and a big pole
[4:49:55] <+Amaideus> Now that I think about it, she might be the oldest NPC you can interact with
[4:49:58] <PMda2nd> bull head
[4:50:09] <ManfredA> @Amaideus there's one other who might be older
[4:50:15] <Johannen> @Amaideus What about the poop head?
[4:50:19] <Darren716> Nah use the other bonfire
[4:50:21] <penitentpendant> @Amaideus Aren't the serpents older?
[4:50:22] <Texeu> Doesn't she say something if you wear the sister's outfit? The gold robe thingys
[4:50:24] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[4:50:26] <SoaringTrumpet> LUL
[4:50:26] <Darren716> If youre gonna go back up

[4:50:48] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> reggie down bad
[4:50:50] <LoreKeeper_Thal> @Mantisman01 conquered
[4:50:51] <+Amaideus> I guess it's possible the Snakes might be older, but there's enough room for debate there that idk
[4:50:52] <PMda2nd> give her the bone
[4:50:57] <%A_German_spy> @Mantisman01 Oh, hey, haven't seen you in ages
[4:51:03] <mar_krow> Notice me

[4:51:09] <penitentpendant> @Mantisman01 Only one serving of Cereal. Followed by one serving of Ceaseless.
[4:51:10] <ManfredA> @Amaideus I think that the boy down below is also potentially older

[4:52:22] <%jonblnt> Great stream guys
[4:52:22] <%Ensign_Epic> He'll probably merk most invaders at this point
[4:52:28] <+Krasmeyts> Blightown has forged Reggarth's Soul into an unfeeling, iron blade.
[4:52:29] <penitentpendant> And the next boss will be one shot by... THE MAN. THE MYTH. THE LEGEND.
[4:52:30] <andre11dr> So Catacombs next time?

[4:53:55] <%Ensign_Epic> Reggie actually has some pretty top-tier skills for this point in the game. He's clearing it like an old pro
[4:54:17] <+Shishi1205> he has a simillar vibe
[4:54:21] <jorniev> GOLD ARMOR
[4:54:23] <OblivionSword1> it's similar enouugh
[4:54:25] <+Bitscreed> Same weapons too IIRC?
[4:54:26] <andre11dr> Yurt is from Latria but ok
[4:54:34] <penitentpendant> Sinners hate Sinners
[4:54:35] <%Prevot> "lol" said the scorpion, "lmao"
[4:54:44] <+セビー> theres a bunch of stuff reggie could path to next sess.. basin, lake, catacombs, sens
[4:54:54] <velgaduere> 8 faith lobosKek
[4:54:57] <penitentpendant> Reggie: No Faith, ONLY LUCK
[4:55:08] <+Jiggisnipe> Reggie was gonna kill Eingyi
[4:55:12] <+Grayhammatter> luck, AND PLUCK
[4:55:19] <%fetrigon> woolieDATTEBAYO woolieDATTEBAYO woolieDATTEBAYO woolieDATTEBAYO woolieDATTEBAYO woolieDATTEBAYO
[4:55:19] <%NeddTheNerd> Clap
[4:55:19] <cheapdoc> Luck man, everything worked out
[4:55:26] <OneThousandTomatoes> Reggie the protagonist
[4:55:35] <+Shishi1205> fundies carry over @WoolieVersus
[4:55:36] <+BignanasTheGawd> next time its Sen's fun house
[4:55:46] <%A_German_spy> IT SURE WILL
[4:55:46] <%Ensign_Epic> I think Sen's Funhouse is the next logical step tbh
[4:55:48] <%Indigo_Automaton> That's literally the game
[4:55:57] <%jonblnt> You made Her look easy
[4:56:01] <jorniev> forever until DS2
[4:56:01] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> you can even play monster hunter with that lesson
[4:56:03] <%Indigo_Automaton> Well done!
[4:56:04] <MeImoth> the Stray lesson will let you clear the ENTIRE soulsborne series
[4:56:06] <+Shishi1205> @Ensign_Epic grass shield first maybe
[4:56:08] <black_mages_matter_> funhouse im looking forward to so hard
[4:56:09] <glass_marcus> Stray is the blueprint
[4:56:10] <+セビー> sens was signposted, but basin is right there too
[4:56:10] <%Rafraud> Literal fundies
[4:56:13] <%Ensign_Epic> You can go after doge but honestly, at this point just head to the anal rodeo
[4:56:23] <youngking_kush> ONE OF US, ONE OF US
[4:56:27] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[4:56:31] <%Ensign_Epic> @Ensign_Epic Pretty sure he has it, I thought he headed down to the area?
[4:56:44] <%Ensign_Epic> Could have sworn he fought that black knight, at least
[4:56:44] <slix3431> Check out GHOST SOULS in the upper Reggie side
[4:56:45] <%Prevot> bet he's gonna mistreat that other waifu tho
[4:56:52] <slix3431> SOULS
[4:56:52] <penitentpendant> Reggie extending that 'foot lore' with 8 legs~
[4:56:57] <%BisoromiBear> don't goof
[4:57:09] <kazadaz> Goddamn, I always get here during the winddown
[4:57:19] <+セビー> reggie hasnt been *in* basin proper, just hit the two entrances
[4:57:21] <Darren716> Ehh you haven't seen the crystal magics
[4:57:23] <ManfredA> Sorcery just snowballs really hard in the midgame
[4:57:23] <+pectusumbra> pyro is easy though since you don't need stats
[4:57:31] <andre11dr> Unless you get Dark Bead and Homing Soul Mass
[4:57:33] <+BignanasTheGawd> yeah, but you cant snipe someone with pyro
[4:57:33] <%Solidnick18> But pyro though
[4:57:35] <%vVAstrAVv> woolies never seen magic with dusks crown and bellowing ring lol
[4:57:38] <%Ensign_Epic> aight then yeah, stopover for GCS is prolly an idea
[4:57:43] <seydaq> all that damage available at lv1
[4:57:52] <+Bitscreed> Good sesh.
[4:57:54] <Darren716> WHAT
[4:58:00] <+swesterly> It’s probably time to commit to an offensive stat
[4:58:04] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[4:58:05] <+Krasmeyts> Oh man, I just got the Drake Meme in my mind with Bloodstained Skirt and Gold Hemmed Skirt for Reggie.
[4:58:07] <MeImoth> Sorcery is ultimately stronger, but requires about 50 Int to reach that state
[4:58:08] <%Ensign_Epic> Man at this point,, Reggie is actually gonna be getting Kindling when the game expects you to, huh?
[4:58:14] <glass_marcus> Will monster have spider tits?
[4:58:30] <%Solidnick18> Fight games
