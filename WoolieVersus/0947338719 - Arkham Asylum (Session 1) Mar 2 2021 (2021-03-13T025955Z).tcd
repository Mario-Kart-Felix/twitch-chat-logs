[0:10:03] <DatAsuna> AoT is good regardless of how those 2 chapters go tbh
[0:10:03] <thefunkiestpunkiest> @MightyDuckShoes It's not THAT good, but people are shocked that people stay dead.
[0:10:04] <leith_aziz> Lets not give SAO credit.-..
[0:10:04] <amiavamp> God Eater is one that had big potential for lore but doesn't really capitalize on it

[0:10:32] <A_CD_By_Thomas> @X2Eliah The Woolie Versus Show was the real killing game all along.
[0:10:32] <Asuterisuku> I liked ZTD.
[0:10:35] <%kewlmyc> Highschool of the Dead's author died, so it's not really the same

[0:10:48] <Tampaoster> @Lancaster_H living in the database oh oh
[0:10:49] <sirthomas2step> Gantz is nightmare fuel haha
[0:10:49] <%Mattais88> "I'll figure out the reason later, right mow Jump needs a new chapter ASAP"

[0:10:51] <$dudedude55555> GANTZ
[0:10:51] <DumbNerdThing> sometimes it's better when things are kept a mystery. oftentimes it's just because the writer is lazy
[0:10:51] <triggersqueeze1985> WONAN
[0:10:52] <%Wulfphelz> I just got here
[0:10:53] <RaidenRising> DATABASE DATABASE WOW WOW
[0:10:54] <+Deekman> best thing about Gantz was the theme song
[0:10:55] <%X2Eliah> @Wulfphelz just, like... life
[0:10:56] <%Feralspirit41> Man woolies on some shit
[0:10:57] <+WizoSavage> VAMPIRES
[0:10:58] <leith_aziz> I havent watched enough of that genre
[0:11:00] <nicversus> @jonblnt :D
[0:11:00] <amiavamp> Not great place to ask, but are there anime that are just MMO shenanigans without the death game or trapped aspect?
[0:11:01] <DatAsuna> @Wulfphelz stories with big mysteries that usually don't pay off
[0:11:01] <+WizoSavage> lol
[0:11:02] <+blastazoid00> Vampires tho
[0:11:03] <Dave_VD> I hope that wasn't a big spoiler for 13 sentinels
[0:11:03] <Murdercles> man fuck you, Gantz is great
[0:11:04] <leith_aziz> So I cant judge
[0:11:05] <Sapphire_Breeze> VAMPIRES
[0:11:06] <MyNameIsRasus> what the fuck is going on
[0:11:07] <+skyheys> gantz is cool
[0:11:08] <$BallerSwagBro9k> If they dont explain what caused the Zombie outbreak and the story has no resolution im not interested
[0:11:09] <AncelDeLambert> WOOLIEEEEEEEEEE!
[0:11:10] <%Stupid121v2> Gantz rules its so bad
[0:11:10] <+Deekman> oh my god I forgot about the Vampires arc
[0:11:11] <+nabs2099> @jaygee303 The only way the show ends "badly" will be up to the personal ideology of each individual viewer. which actually means the show is phenomenal. but there IS a right answer and it probably isn't the one that titanfolk are backing.
[0:11:12] <Prevot> we talking about that cube movie now?
[0:11:12] <+Someitalian123> don't worry about why
[0:11:13] <AncelDeLambert> MY BOI YA PLAYIN IT!!
[0:11:14] <Darkyello> gantz is the shit woolie
[0:11:14] <%Wulfphelz> Thanks yall!
[0:11:16] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> The kid doing kung fu was neat
[0:11:18] <%osaka_daioh> its not dave_VD
[0:11:18] <DatAsuna> @Wulfphelz snowpiercer being the inciting example
[0:11:19] <jorniev> GANTZ is stupid fun BUT STUPID
[0:11:19] <%Exiliator> Okok ok! How about we make it about like. Factory-farming... but PEOPLE.
[0:11:19] <leith_aziz> So plan ahead
[0:11:23] <leith_aziz> Nice
[0:11:24] <@Solidus_113> Most stories are made with a vague start and ending, and everything in the middle is bullshit
[0:11:25] <bitterpelican> @leith_aziz Yo, we MAY have the original SAO. But we still have the glorious abridged series thanks to it, so bad things give some good consequences, shit's great
[0:11:26] <jaimethepanda> Gantz was dumb fun
[0:11:29] <aus_htx> lol bleach
[0:11:29] <+bs_commander> hell yeah gantz lol
[0:11:30] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @Wulfphelz stories in media that only have a premise and not the story itself, so the media ends up messy
[0:11:31] <user_naim> I haven‚Äôt seen Westworld, but is this also Westworld?
[0:11:37] <%jonblnt> Gantz is the definition of style over substance
[0:11:38] <+Deekman> Dangaronpa 3's ending is the WORST
[0:11:39] <%Stupid121v2> V3 is peak video games
[0:11:39] <AncelDeLambert> this is hilarious, I JUST downloaded this game again last night because I was feeling Arkham vibes and needed to replay it
[0:11:40] <sirthomas2step> characters who ask why in gantz always die
[0:11:44] <pixel_river> LUL
[0:11:45] <%X2Eliah> ....
[0:11:47] <MyNameIsRasus> The Reggie face
[0:11:49] <+blastazoid00> Bleach is the definition of making it up as you go
[0:11:49] <%kewlmyc> I remember that. It sucked.
[0:11:50] <@Menitta> What if me mum ran on battries
[0:11:50] <%mattwillpost> It's like a really strong Pilot Episode having no idea where to go (COUGH LOST COUGH)
[0:11:51] <Prevot> LUL
[0:11:52] <nicversus> Some artists REALLY swing for the fences with their setups, but fall flat on the execution
[0:11:52] <%KetsuoTaberu> Just like real life
[0:11:52] <amiavamp> so it's stonks
[0:11:53] <%paladinstarbuster> Danganronpa 3 anime killed the whole thing
[0:11:53] <%RadDude6969> Death Stranding?
[0:11:54] <%Kriss1827> one piece is still great :)

[0:12:00] <heart_ablaze> balsk mirror?
[0:12:00] <$dudedude55555> woolie should read "this croc will die in 100 days"
[0:12:01] <PKSomething> that sounds stupid
[0:12:01] <pixel_river> thats the most zoomer plot
[0:12:01] <meganicmp3> i love and hate danganronpa
[0:12:02] <Murdercles> not every story needs to have a big master plan or completely tied-up ending
[0:12:02] <%wibbwobbler> another one
[0:12:04] <%X2Eliah> YEAH OK THAT SOUNDS FUN
[0:12:05] <Prevot> wtf I need to read this shit

[0:12:09] <%mattwillpost> this feels like a writers room
[0:12:09] <DatAsuna> Isayama has actually talked about how he wanted to change the ending at times but feels like he can't because the ending was the first idea he had. lol
[0:12:10] <%Exiliator> Woolie are you trying to tell us something here? Kappa
[0:12:11] <brondeef> Social Commentary for kids!

[0:12:14] <leith_aziz> @bitterpelican: There's an abridged ?
[0:12:15] <jorniev> OVER REACHING

[0:12:55] <user_naim> Which brings us back to watch Source Code everyone. It‚Äôs cool.
[0:12:55] <amiavamp> heaven or hell, let's duel

[0:13:20] <Jdrockefeller> I have the same issue with Danganronpa's ultimate premise
[0:13:20] <andre11dr> But hey One Piece and HxH got to stay good ,so there's that
[0:13:22] <DatAsuna> Purge is what it sounds like
[0:13:22] <ExpressNode> Now not so much
[0:13:22] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Cabin in the Woods?
[0:13:22] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's why cabin in the woods is the shit
[0:13:23] <Jaxnos> essentially, Michael Jordan became Prime Minister of Japan and said fuck dem kids.

[0:22:29] <meganicmp3> more like cringe note
[0:22:32] <peachy996> Combat doesn't get into that real freeflow goodness until City but Asylum is still a good time

[0:22:46] <MyNameIsRasus> I personally think Reggie is the star
[0:22:49] <NoireRequiem> It is Rael
[0:22:50] <%Sparkseid> woolieLORE
[0:22:52] <AncelDeLambert> Origins is NOT good
[0:22:53] <PanicSwytch> Origins was good
[0:22:54] <%doomerskeletor13> It‚Äôs me, the Origins defender
[0:22:54] <+MrMediocrity> Keep a watch out for the spiderweb physics. They were cutting edge for their time apparently
[0:22:55] <%Lion_kun> Asylum>City>Knight

[0:22:59] <A_CD_By_Thomas> @KeiganOfAstora Back on the Friendcast, Liam compared Pat getting on Woolie for not playing Arkham to someone saying "You haven't seen DEATH NOTE?"
[0:22:59] <leith_aziz> Origins is fine. It can be a fun time
[0:22:59] <jorniev> What are you dense, stupid? I am THE GODDAMNED BATMAN
[0:23:00] <%X2Eliah> ohh
[0:23:01] <%KeiganOfAstora> Reggie said that like he's scared of Minh

[0:23:10] <jamox1> HES BACK
[0:23:10] <+Neerb25> Asylum is stiffer and smaller than its sequels, but Asylum is a true Metroidvania and has a constant feeling of tension, so it's got that going

[0:23:38] <+samuraiknack> Mihn>Billy
[0:23:39] <@Menitta> not really a spoiler
[0:23:39] <devanmuse> Kiryu didn't murder kids, so he wins by default
[0:23:40] <meganicmp3> kiryu does heat moves
[0:23:41] <scrublordsamurai> minh
[0:23:42] <@Menitta> Its fine
[0:23:42] <leith_aziz> (I've played the later games)
[0:23:42] <enerkaizer> Guys, don't spopil Y1-7 for woolie. let him discover the series for himself
[0:23:43] <jorniev> FUCK YOU one guy
[0:23:43] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:23:45] <+GenesisKnight> Kratos got better but Kiryu's been a better dad for longer
[0:23:45] <bitterpelican> Kiryu is a father Papa NieR WISHES he was
[0:23:46] <+cluckme_arse> eyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeye
[0:23:47] <%Mattais88> That dominatrix probably calls him daddy fi he wants
[0:23:47] <andre11dr> Kiryu is good dad ,kinda
[0:23:47] <Prevot> every one of those polls is just a popularity contest
[0:23:47] <peachy996> I think all 4 Batman games are good.
[0:23:48] <Halospaz117> He just said he knows guys
[0:23:49] <fuji_92> good job one guy, fucoong spoilers
[0:23:49] <+Gohyakuen> origins is better than Knight
[0:23:50] <+JaseAdrift> woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY
[0:23:52] <MyNameIsRasus> DISCORD
[0:23:53] <PanicSwytch> Asylum > City > Origins > Knight
[0:23:54] <+TheotherKristian> Alright here's my order. Asylum, Origins (yeah, I know), City, Knight
[0:23:54] <%Dante_Namikaze1> The girl is what he's talking about but it's still not right to bring it up
[0:23:55] <MyNameIsRasus> PRESIDES
[0:23:58] <MyNameIsRasus> IN SOCIETY
[0:23:59] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Arkham Knight can fuck off though
[0:23:59] <%doomerskeletor13> Hot take: all the Arkham games are pretty good to great
[0:24:01] <%LCLSmoothie> jorker
[0:24:02] <MyNameIsRasus> YOUR SOCIETY
[0:24:05] <Darren716> Woolie tested Yakuza 3 so he knows Haruka exists
[0:24:09] <fuji_92> LUL
[0:24:12] <+TheotherKristian> The important thing is that Arkham Knight is fourth
[0:24:12] <meganicmp3> im da joka baby
[0:24:14] <NumbF4ke> Nioh so good
[0:24:18] <%wibbwobbler> society
[0:24:18] <%KeiganOfAstora> Yeet
[0:24:19] <%CaptainPileDriver> "non lethal"
[0:24:19] <Asuterisuku> Woolie, you're going to have a good time with this game.
[0:24:22] <%RadDude6969> SO PSY A T
[0:24:23] <andre11dr> Also Pokemon pearl was the best 2d one ,and it deserves it
[0:24:27] <Halospaz117> Batman pulling of Heat Moves
[0:24:27] <jorniev> EXTREMELY NON LETHAK
[0:24:27] <%Stupid121v2> this game is NON LETHAL
[0:24:28] <mudamudajo> I love the pic of Leto Jesus joker with the words poopoo and peepee in each hand.
[0:24:28] <leith_aziz> I cant choose between Knight or Origins. I think Knight brings new ideas at least, but not all of them are great
[0:24:29] <jamox1> It‚Äôs ok everyone, if we don‚Äôt like society we can blame the beasts
[0:24:30] <$BallerSwagBro9k> BATMAN HAS NEVER KILLED ANYONE
[0:24:34] <jamox1> ^
[0:24:35] <%Wulfphelz> Numb arms are the worst LUL
[0:24:37] <JZPotter> Arkham Knight is the best one, Idgaf
[0:24:40] <fuji_92> sleep paralysis NotLikeThis yeah
[0:24:40] <bitterpelican> Yo
[0:24:40] <ralphfromdk> He has played PS4 spiderman / Miles Morales, right? he should be okay combat wise
[0:24:44] <pedrinoj> best worst movie that you recomennd?
[0:24:48] <prime_name> Numb Arms walking up is the worst
[0:24:48] <brunoberserk> City >> Knight >> Asylum >> Origin
[0:24:51] <Ipsenscastle> sleep paralysis is different to going numb
[0:24:52] <leith_aziz> I still prefer going for something new instaed of playing it safe
[0:24:52] <%X2Eliah> yeah
[0:24:55] <+WizoSavage> NEED AMPUTATE
[0:24:55] <triggersqueeze1985> Kiryu has never killed anyone
[0:24:56] <bitterpelican> What if. Batman. BUT WITH HEAT MOVES?
[0:24:57] <+nabs2099> Just imagine a Batman who doesn't know what sex is and you have a superior batman
[0:24:58] <+Neerb25> Knight has too much car puzzles/battles but it's still a terrific game. Driving around Gotham is fun and the combat is all-time best.
[0:24:59] <Depthcharge2030> Origins is slept on
[0:25:00] <Asuterisuku> Knight has a lot of cool shit going on, but doesn't feel as cohesive a pachage as City.
[0:25:00] <user_naim> @pedrinoj Tokyo Drift
[0:25:01] <pixel_river> when that happens i try not to move
[0:25:03] <%X2Eliah> Or if one leg is dead and you gotta go to the bathroom
[0:25:03] <fuji_92> damn
[0:25:05] <+RPG_CHICAGO> the world has been waiting for this
[0:25:07] <%runegod20> my big fear is my bed collapsing in my sleep, getting stuck in the blanket, and suffocating
[0:25:09] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Car Parkour can fuck right off, Knight sucks
[0:25:11] <%GeneralSCPatton> @ipsenscastle But the sheer helpless panic is similar
[0:25:11] <MyNameIsRasus> Damn nice dude
[0:25:16] <%KeiganOfAstora> @RAAAAAINMAKER Wrong
[0:25:19] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Spider-Man is so much faster than Arkham, so you have to turn down your expectations
[0:25:27] <+Patch_TheSquid> patcht7Iroc patcht7Iroc patcht7Iroc patcht7Iroc
[0:25:28] <leith_aziz> You'll have fun
[0:25:30] <meganicmp3> get the collectables woolie
[0:25:30] <TheWizardOfWordplay> knights fine
[0:25:32] <%KeiganOfAstora> Oh didn't see that said Car, my bad
[0:25:35] <+Dova573> the spiderman 2 of batman
[0:25:39] <+Zeroblazex> It‚Äôs a CLASSIC
[0:25:40] <%LCLSmoothie> batman is a big tank, spiderman is nimble and fast
[0:25:40] <AncelDeLambert> Spider Man does Open World right: small
[0:25:41] <fuji_92> yeah, batman is slow spider man
[0:25:42] <%Stupid121v2> woolie likes batman even a little so he'll be fine
[0:25:42] <%X2Eliah> It's more fun than COD
[0:25:44] <%KeiganOfAstora> Let's get it over with lol
[0:25:44] <%wibbwobbler> ah man batman
[0:25:45] <Asuterisuku> Collectibles in this game are so tricky.
[0:25:45] <Lancaster_H> I mean, woolie JUST played HL1 for the first time
[0:25:47] <leith_aziz> The atmosphere is worth giving a shot
[0:25:48] <%Exiliator> How dare you do tjat!? woolieOMG
[0:25:50] <prime_name> I can't wait for the deep dive comic book lore that gets brought up in this LP
[0:25:51] <peachy996> True Spidey is faster but Batman has more meat to the story and sidequests
[0:25:52] <DelgotHansto> Best Joker
[0:25:54] <prime_name> Like One Face
[0:25:54] <Jaysky> Batman feels weighty
[0:25:55] <frostyjay3> Imo Arkham City is the best one
[0:25:59] <Asuterisuku> @Lancaster_H And he did it via Black Mesa
[0:25:59] <meganicmp3> it set the standard for comic book games
[0:26:00] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's not
[0:26:00] <enZymeth> LEED

[0:26:09] <peachy996> I think the sidequests in Spider are incredibly lacking
[0:26:09] <Shardlab> It's cruel
[0:26:10] <MyNameIsRasus> "It's just not a good show innit"
[0:26:10] <RealDurdyDan> It was cool when I was 12
[0:26:10] <Dzikka> it's trash

[0:26:11] <chll0ne> elfen lied stinks
[0:26:11] <enerkaizer> It#s pronounced "Elfen Leed"

[0:26:13] <@akuda_bar> "my beef is... it's not good"
[0:26:14] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's basic and violence for violence sake
[0:26:15] <+RiverKing13> It sucks
[0:26:15] <masterfire23> but nudity though

[0:26:37] <peachy996> So it's Genocyber?
[0:26:37] <YaminoRaiden> it's a lot of shock, basically.
[0:26:37] <%Jiggisnipe> LUL
[0:26:37] <Ipsenscastle> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ exactly

[0:26:40] <+Deekman> is this on crunchyroll?
[0:26:41] <deviljhojho_> the lie in elfen lied is that people say its a good anime
[0:26:42] <%X2Eliah> what the fuck who wants dead dogs in their porn????
[0:26:43] <JZPotter> Elfen Lied turned me off the second they beat a dog, I was like nah. I'm out.

[0:26:43] <+Negus_Rex> "what if humans are the real monsters hmmmm?"
[0:26:43] <%KetsuoTaberu> Lmao
[0:26:44] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I mean if you are used to SPider-Man, Batman is giong to feel slower and jankier since we have improved upon it
[0:26:45] <+condemned_15> it's not even close to hentai
[0:26:46] <+Sparkseid> @fuji_92 exactly
[0:26:46] <%RadDude6969> I can't believe the elfen lied

[0:27:03] <%Exiliator> Not my fetish, but you do you
[0:27:03] <falyden> gurogirls
[0:27:04] <mudamudajo> Asylum really inspired a ton of what games still use now. Arkham combat is in the lexicon for a reason. So while some may have made it better, Asylum was the precursor.
[0:27:04] <leith_aziz> Point is: Dont be pretensious
[0:27:05] <%CaptainPileDriver> Reggie's face
[0:27:05] <%krispen_wa> MAJIMA?

[0:27:39] <bitterpelican> You want a good anime from that period - watch Ergo Proxy
[0:27:39] <LVL1_Scumbag> Couldn't you say the same thing about Berserk?
[0:27:39] <$arcielardor> It's b-movie schlock
[0:27:40] <%X2Eliah> IT'S CALLED "TRASH"
[0:27:41] <rytisone> the plot of H-Doom
[0:27:42] <%Exiliator> That description honestly sounds AWESOME LUL

[0:27:43] <%CaptainPileDriver> torture porn is weird says woolie
[0:27:45] <NoireRequiem> Erotic horror?
[0:27:45] <Shardlab> It's just mean for the sake of being evil
[0:27:45] <%Stupid121v2> I rmemeber my friends LOVING it and now they're all 25 and HATE it lol
[0:27:46] <+Hawk_Rush> it's called GARBAGE
[0:27:47] <PanicSwytch> If u want gore watch Psycho Pass
[0:27:47] <+GenesisKnight> Starring the writer's barely disguised fetish?
[0:27:47] <scrublordsamurai> an 80's slasher movie?
[0:27:47] <%Livelinne> Are you new to this Reggie? woolieMIRIN woolieKICKDAD
[0:27:49] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it's like playing Marvel vs Capcom 2 and then going back to Street Fighter II BASE

[0:27:56] <Tennochief> Ecchi Guro
[0:27:56] <Dave_VD> Woolie has had big opinions today
[0:27:57] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Torture Porn is disgusting
[0:27:58] <leith_aziz> MK is also guilty of being gore porn
[0:28:00] <%krispen_wa> It sounds like the trash that Matt would ironically like
[0:28:00] <%Wulfphelz> Never ever
[0:28:01] <Tracazoid> You aren't missing out Reggie
[0:28:02] <Halospaz117> You saved him Woolie
[0:28:02] <leith_aziz> Dont deny it
[0:28:03] <OldManDeckardCain> elfen lied's author pretty much only does this kinda mangas, except for that one weird ski jumping one LUL
[0:28:04] <Lancaster_H> Hey H-Doom is art
[0:28:04] <Shardlab> You're better off, Reggie
[0:28:07] <MyNameIsRasus> It's an edgelord's wet dream
[0:28:12] <%dreadedcthulhu> speaking of gory, has woolie read Chainsaw Man yet?
[0:28:14] <Tampaoster> Mnemosine is great guro too
[0:28:16] <%Wulfphelz> There's literally nothing there
[0:28:17] <leith_aziz> So MK
[0:28:18] <%Sparkseid> good decision, Reggie
[0:28:19] <%Konquerer> opening song is great though
[0:28:20] <%wibbwobbler> it's pretty bad lmao
[0:28:20] <%GeneralSCPatton> FUCKING YELLOW TEMPERANCE
[0:28:22] <fuji_92> look at this DIO kicking a puppy
[0:28:26] <+ManimalCrackerss> its Very Clearly A Fetish Thing because of how much they focus on it
[0:28:27] <%ZweihanderSteve> yo but have you seen those vector crafts SeemsGood
[0:28:29] <Tampaoster> Did someone here whatched mnemosine?
[0:28:31] <heart_ablaze> again, redo of healer....
[0:28:35] <%RadDude6969> Dio killed a dog too
[0:28:36] <%CaptainPileDriver> look how fucked up this scene is of a kids torturing a puppy
[0:28:37] <jamox1> @dreadedcthulhu better yet has Woolie seen THAT panel from chainsaw man
[0:28:37] <PanicSwytch> Parasyte and Psycho Pass is good gore anime
[0:28:38] <Tennochief> Chainsaw Man is fucking awesome
[0:28:38] <%mattwillpost> Meaning? No, LOOK AT IT.
[0:28:38] <nicversus> Yeah I bought some bootleg elfen lied dvds from Chinatown in toronto when I was in high school and it nearly put me off anime forever
[0:28:39] <leith_aziz> Yep, EXACTLY Mortal Kombat
[0:28:39] <+EdenOfLove> jojo literally has a puppy die in the first episode
[0:28:40] <heart_ablaze> never watch it
[0:28:46] <%paladinstarbuster> Its a horror anime
[0:28:46] <enerkaizer> Elfenlied is pretty much a proto-typicall early 2000s anime/manga before the Tv censorship laws got stricter
[0:28:46] <%DkLordG> the opening song is the only thing of substance
[0:28:46] <+EdenOfLove> and you love jojo
[0:28:46] <+NocturnePsycho> i never watched higurashi, is it any better than elfen lied?
[0:28:49] <%Stupid121v2> Its like the author is playing in blood, and not the character lol
[0:28:51] <leith_aziz> (Sorry I just hate the gore of that game)
[0:28:53] <user_naim> I like the jojo censorship shadow. Adds to the scary in a way
[0:28:55] <sonofthedeepsouth> you know
[0:28:56] <deviljhojho_> she gets it super hard
[0:28:57] <viciousgrim> redo of healer is hentai right?
[0:28:59] <YaminoRaiden> @edenoflove different context
[0:29:01] <%hazardousmidget> Elfen Lied is an edgelords wet dream, its everything their parents told them wasnt good for them lmao
[0:29:01] <+Nitro4life2> @EdenOfLove this
[0:29:02] <asdief_> I murdered your parents cuz love, elven lied suck
[0:29:03] <srv4254> when dogs die in jojo its fucked but cartoonish compared to elfen lied
[0:29:04] <%dreadedcthulhu> @jamox1 there's a LOT of That Panels in chainsaw man
[0:29:04] <+Dova573> comics or show?
[0:29:05] <%X2Eliah> @EdenOfLove they didn't fetishize it so much tho
[0:29:06] <amiavamp> @NocturnePsycho they're not even in the same league lol
[0:29:07] <Asuterisuku> The Boys is... consistent with that.
[0:29:07] <marvel877> That one bad guy in Digimon kicking that puppy.
[0:29:07] <Murdercles> the Amoral creative space is a valid and interesting to explore as the Moral space
[0:29:14] <leith_aziz> To be fair with JOJO, that just makes you hate the villian
[0:29:16] <Trigon_Trey> the boyz comic is waaaaaaaay worse
[0:29:16] <ralphfromdk> The boys is half satire in how hard it goes.
[0:29:17] <%ZweihanderSteve> @nocturnepsycho i'd say so
[0:29:17] <%paladinstarbuster> higurashi is signifugantly better than elfen lied
[0:29:18] <%Lion_kun> Boys is edgelord garbage.
[0:29:19] <whiteblacklight74> what did i walk into
[0:29:20] <+Hawk_Rush> The Boys' opening is super good with that
[0:29:21] <fuji_92> @viciousgrim it isnt but it tries so hard to be, that it might as well
[0:29:21] <RealDurdyDan> The Boys comic was full of gore
[0:29:26] <jamox1> @dreadedcthulhu very true! The astronauts one
[0:29:30] <jorniev> so stupid
[0:29:31] <heart_ablaze> @viciousgrim basically, but with no consent
[0:29:31] <+eanscrale> Shot her with style
[0:29:34] <leith_aziz> That is story, so you can judge it
[0:29:36] <peachy996> Kung Fu Hustle
[0:29:37] <%L3m0nTwi5t> The Boys has been a pretty good show
[0:29:39] <meganicmp3> gore for gores sake is garbage :)
[0:29:39] <+HowIPendragon> The Boys reminds me of Powers. Edgelord AF
[0:29:42] <%mattwillpost> Turns out the evil dude is evil
[0:29:43] <%LCLSmoothie> show good, comic bad for the boys
[0:29:44] <%Seancicle> brb afk skooku2POG
[0:29:44] <%dreadedcthulhu> THAT is a good spread @jamox1
[0:29:47] <algi80> hi all PrideLionHey
[0:29:47] <+nabs2099> @viciousgrim It looks like it but I don't think it is. Besides it's just an edgelords incel fantasy more than anything which is just bleh
[0:29:56] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I will not to discuss a villain killing a dog, but that is a thing people are talking about lately *cough*
[0:29:57] <MyNameIsRasus> yo sexy nun girls are alright
[0:29:57] <%DkLordG> @whiteblacklight74 someone asked how he feels about Elfen Lied
[0:29:57] <RealDurdyDan> Kimiko is waifu
[0:29:58] <twoto858> That was dumb
[0:30:00] <leith_aziz> Absolution is so weird
[0:30:00] <%Stupid121v2> Is Madoka Magica edgy?
[0:30:01] <pixel_river> That was so effed up
[0:30:01] <Trigon_Trey> gore porn is trash
[0:30:02] <jamox1> @dreadedcthulhu one of my favorite manga panels
[0:30:03] <peachy996> Nathan's got a great song
[0:30:05] <MyNameIsRasus> not the gore shit tho
[0:30:08] <Garry_Guyface> louiseyPain
[0:30:09] <brunoberserk> WutFace
[0:30:10] <%Javaa01> Absolution is real bad
[0:30:11] <Halospaz117> What did No More Heroes do to deserve getting compared to Hitman Absolution
[0:30:13] <amiavamp> @Stupid121v2 no
[0:30:14] <%Wulfphelz> Gore just for the sake of being edgy is so lame and it's easy to tell when something is just to be edgy
[0:30:14] <%Lion_kun> I hate the boys because it's so one note. Everyone in this universe is a dickbag, we get it.
[0:30:15] <rytisone> weird flex but ok
[0:30:18] <%Exiliator> I think it's more of how different people are affected differently by all things
[0:30:18] <Halospaz117> Fuck Hitman Absolution
[0:30:20] <leith_aziz> Weird that we dont talk about this Mortal Kombat
[0:30:22] <Lancaster_H> no kinkshaming

[0:30:23] <%mattwillpost> mattwillpost subscribed at Tier 2.
[0:30:25] <fuji_92> Redo is an rape self insert bullshit pile of an anime
[0:30:26] <leith_aziz> Its JUST as guilty
[0:30:28] <heart_ablaze> edgy = good right?!
[0:30:29] <%dreadedcthulhu> @jamox1 i could honestly gush about chainsaw man for hours
[0:30:29] <user_naim> oh fuck i forgot about absolution
[0:30:31] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> That Absolution trailer looked fucking awesome though...
[0:30:33] <huskarl_zap> Now tell me about serbian film
[0:30:34] <+Zeroblazex> Reminds me of Redo of healer. The absolute worst thing I‚Äôve ever seen
[0:30:36] <+JaseAdrift> MK9
[0:30:36] <%RadDude6969> @stupid121v2 I'd say it's more existential than edgy
[0:30:38] <deviljhojho_> gore, sexy= sore
[0:30:39] <GhostRavens> what do you think about devilman: crybaby?
[0:30:40] <+TheotherKristian> Alright, I looked at Elfen Lied
[0:30:41] <Prevot> sounds liker game of thrones
[0:30:41] <frostyjay3> @fuji_92 This is true as shit
[0:30:43] <exnuart> hitman absolution is what got me into the series
[0:30:45] <%L3m0nTwi5t> woolieONEGUY
[0:30:45] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:30:46] <+Zeroblazex> It‚Äôs borderline torture porn
[0:30:48] <jamox1> @dreadedcthulhu it‚Äôs very cool
[0:30:49] <DragonSpooker> I was not ready for Elfen Lied at 13
[0:30:49] <Jaysky> Senseless violence for the sake of it. Look at this puppy get beat for the sole purpose of making a character more DEEP
[0:30:50] <%CaptainPileDriver> kink shame the torture porn
[0:30:51] <%paladinstarbuster> Woolie just cant handle gore
[0:30:55] <exnuart> the nuns felt out of place in game
[0:30:58] <GhoulishCripple> Nathan Copeland is the low end of the spectrum because NMH is filled with that level of wanton violence being played as almost a tired trope
[0:30:58] <Sternieliscious> Hitman Absolution was so bad that most of the staff was replaced for Hitman 2016. Incidental dialogue writers did the 2016 game.
[0:30:59] <deviljhojho_> those kids had it coming
[0:31:02] <pixel_river> LUL

[0:31:12] <jorniev> FUCK THEM KIDS
[0:31:12] <GhostRavens> "Fuck them kids" - Woolie Madden, 2021

[0:31:14] <%KetsuoTaberu> Yep
[0:31:15] <YaminoRaiden> 4 of them were brainwashed.
[0:31:15] <Bisquick_Bunny> Redo of Healer is just glorified revenge porn
[0:31:16] <leith_aziz> Aside from V3
[0:31:17] <%Stupid121v2> Remember when that guy fucked Junko's body
[0:31:18] <glass_marcus> I too wanted to push the button
[0:31:18] <+Hawk_Rush> HE WAS THE COOLEST GUY
[0:31:19] <+nabs2099> oh they GET OFF ALRIGHT
[0:31:21] <Prevot> "but we can kill guilty children, right?"
[0:31:22] <%doomerskeletor13> Pride500 this was the first game I ever platinumed as a kid. Really excited to see y‚Äôall play it. The game was written by Paul Dini, one of the main writers on the animated series. It‚Äôs also partially inspired by Grant Morrison‚Äôs Arkham Asylum graphic novel. Lots of comic references
[0:31:22] <%X2Eliah> OBITO IS THE COOLEST THO
[0:31:22] <+skyheys> lmao
[0:31:23] <CaptainPileDriver> thAt LP was real bad.

[0:31:24] <rosemon5001> explain something as a gore fetish and not appreciating the art but whut eva
[0:31:26] <%paladinstarbuster> They were children being manipulated by literally the greatest manipulator
[0:31:26] <AstrodropGaming> Woolie says "Fuck them kids"
[0:31:26] <%bearwagon> nah pham its different moral systems or some bullshit idk
[0:31:31] <jamox1> THE COOLEST GUY
[0:31:31] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Woolie Jordan: "Fuck them kids."
[0:31:35] <+eanscrale> less animation than the game apparently
[0:31:38] <Gamingc00l> we don't talk about that
[0:31:39] <%Exiliator> Eh, maybe
[0:31:39] <dundore77> one is literally a serial killer with 50+ kills, before they get to the school. Nothing happens
[0:31:39] <Torgue_1> What was Woolie talking about?
[0:31:40] <+Neerb25> everyone in Danganronpa is too dumb to live
[0:31:41] <%X2Eliah> Btw Batman is just Obito.
[0:31:41] <%LastHazzerd> or you could just say danganranpa sucks
[0:31:42] <leith_aziz> I would say its the Anime which just ruins stuff
[0:31:45] <amiavamp> @Stupid121v2 madoka magica gets construed as edgy because people who haven't watched it only know the one famous scene
[0:31:47] <%Wulfphelz> No shit woolie LUL
[0:31:47] <+Zeroblazex> People give goblin slayer the shock value treatment but redo is just the worst

[0:32:55] <%patriotrenegade> looooool
[0:32:55] <%Sparkseid> bruh
[0:32:55] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Jojo gore is SUPER MILD
[0:32:55] <fuji_92> CHEW HIM OUT WOOLIE
[0:32:55] <%democrazyyy> jojo zooms in on dogs exploding
[0:32:56] <%CaptainPileDriver> Jesus head on naked body
[0:32:57] <%mattwillpost> LMAOOOOO the EXCEPTIONS
[0:32:57] <ExpressNode> It zooms in on the dogs though
[0:32:58] <DumbNerdThing> is there a plan to do the whole arkham series?
[0:32:58] <%RadDude6969> @stupid121v2 some scenes of the prequel parts are alright I guess
[0:32:58] <+Reverend_Roscoe> woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY
[0:32:59] <Halospaz117> FUCKIN BRIAN
[0:32:59] <%Lion_kun> Only on mutilated dogs
[0:32:59] <LVL1_Scumbag> Berserk tho
[0:33:00] <bitterpelican> Jojo part 8 super does that tho
[0:33:00] <MyNameIsRasus> Jojo is cartoon gore AT WORST
[0:33:00] <rosemon5001> literally does but oky
[0:33:00] <%paladinstarbuster> Akira does
[0:33:00] <%patriotrenegade> GET HIS ASS
[0:33:00] <amiavamp> But what if Dio was on the camera tho
[0:33:01] <jorniev> it did though
[0:33:02] <+WizoSavage> Jojo is gruesome but it isn't super gory
[0:33:03] <Chichen> comparing JoJo to that is INSANE
[0:33:04] <%Exiliator> Welllllll
[0:33:04] <%Stupid121v2> Gore us allowed to exist, its about the author PLAYING IN BLOOD
[0:33:04] <huskarl_zap> Unless its a dog
[0:33:05] <GhoulishCripple> jojo manga did zoom in on burning dog corpse
[0:33:06] <leith_aziz> But yes, its one or the other
[0:33:06] <DelgotHansto> You think JOJO is bad?
[0:33:07] <jorniev> THAT HAPPENED
[0:33:07] <+Nitro4life2> Jojo it's too busy focusing on junk
[0:33:09] <brian_peppers1> That brian guy has some stuff going on
[0:33:09] <AvroEltz> If there is gore, it is ONE PANEL
[0:33:09] <Lancaster_H> it does though
[0:33:10] <passserby> also jojo violence means almost nothing when they fully heal in like 55 panels later
[0:33:10] <%doomerskeletor13> Woolie is right and he should say it
[0:33:11] <meganicmp3> let them know son
[0:33:12] <crash400> You don't fight the mentally ill in arkham asylum.
[0:33:14] <user_naim> WoolieStaresAt our dumb opinions
[0:33:14] <+FuqBoiSlim> Jojo is like a 6 on a scale of 10
[0:33:14] <fuji_92> GET HIM
[0:33:14] <%runegod20> it's not jerk off edge gore
[0:33:15] <+skyheys> THERE'S THAT ONR TIME
[0:33:16] <whiteblacklight74> The thing JoJo superfocuses on tends to be the homoerotica
[0:33:16] <leith_aziz> I get you
[0:33:19] <mdkcde> Jojo's violence is not Erotic ONE GUY
[0:33:20] <%Exiliator> I think there is, but you dont noticed it
[0:33:21] <meganicmp3> go off
[0:33:21] <Stewbedale> the difference is the tone
[0:33:22] <Asuterisuku> Jojo doesn't fetishize it.
[0:33:24] <+ConAirOnDVD> There's gore and then there's torture porn
[0:33:26] <MyNameIsRasus> The mental gymnastics of this dude
[0:33:26] <NoireRequiem> Jotora did smooch that one nurse
[0:33:26] <DatAsuna> OVA iggy got it so hard
[0:33:26] <+TheotherKristian> Jojo does like killing dogs
[0:33:27] <deviljhojho_> the jojo gore is loony tunes stuff half the time and 80s horror the rest of it
[0:33:27] <velgaduere> no thanks
[0:33:28] <ralphfromdk> Plenty gore, but the artist doesn't have a wank to it.
[0:33:29] <+Reverend_Roscoe> Berserk isn't even as bad as Elfen Lied
[0:33:29] <Alejandroxciv> nakedness and violence together oh no
[0:33:29] <jamesthebrave> idk man there's some stuff in Part 3 and 4 that's kinda uhhhhh
[0:33:29] <+NocturnePsycho> lmaoooo
[0:33:30] <jorniev> YUP NOT A FETISH just gross
[0:33:30] <+BigBruthaThunda> I wanna see batman beat up the poors now
[0:33:31] <sonofthedeepsouth> Pope Em
[0:33:32] <+Hawk_Rush> sorry, didn't realize I was supposed to jerk off to DIO'S DEAHT
[0:33:33] <%bearwagon> LUL
[0:33:33] <%slandracon> highwa1Rad highwa1Rad highwa1Rad
[0:33:33] <SheefEatsBeef> it's more body horror than gore
[0:33:34] <leith_aziz> Yep, like MK
[0:33:35] <%L3m0nTwi5t> Guessing Woolie isn't a fan of High School of the Dead woolieGIRLS
[0:33:35] <enerkaizer> It depends what gets focused in that situation. But still, JoJos Gore level lead to the series only getting an adaption in the last decade instead of the early 90ies
[0:33:35] <heart_ablaze> both happen,but not at the same time
[0:33:36] <sonofthedeepsouth> I DO NOT WISH TO
[0:33:37] <huskarl_zap> ok
[0:33:37] <Chichen> his take sucks
[0:33:39] <+skyheys> part 7 :U
[0:33:39] <+RowenCleric> get em Woolz get em

[0:33:42] <%illtima> >Elfen lied Defenders >Year 2021 How
[0:33:43] <sonofthedeepsouth> ELFEN LEID SUCKS
[0:33:43] <%bearwagon> Woolie taking off the weights today
[0:33:44] <Shardlab> The one poor ditzy girl who gets her head removed
[0:33:44] <+GenesisKnight> Get his ass, Woolie
[0:33:45] <%paladinstarbuster> Oh my god a titty popped out now its weird -Woolie
[0:33:46] <%Sparkseid> This sounds like someone who hasn't seen Elfen Lied
[0:33:46] <valriot> Theres a difference between tasteful and tasteless gore
[0:33:47] <%CaptainPileDriver> tbf arkham asylum inmates are from a prison not the asylum
[0:33:48] <mortalmanbaby> kill this man wooie
[0:33:48] <+JaseAdrift> woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY
[0:33:48] <mdkcde> Ban ONE GUY ,
[0:33:50] <mudamudajo> !DESTROYED!
[0:33:50] <velgaduere> Woolie wants BLOOD lobosKek
[0:33:50] <orpleborple> jojo has more mutilated dogs then interesting villains but i wouldn‚Äôt call it gore porn
[0:33:51] <Manmush> LUL
[0:33:51] <BigManLugan> I LIKE THIS WOOLIE
[0:33:52] <%Exiliator> Is this Woolie after dark? Kappa
[0:33:52] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I knew what I was watching when Jojo had vampires hiding in a horse
[0:33:53] <+Undenizen> hey chat, i just got here. has woolie played this or are we going in blind?
[0:33:53] <+nabs2099> STUPID ASS TAKE, ONE GUY
[0:33:54] <meganicmp3> SPICY WOOLIE
[0:33:55] <prime_name> Man, I am digging Shin Woolie
[0:33:56] <Janzer_> stupid takes on the internet? whhhhaaatt
[0:33:57] <%Wulfphelz> Theres a difference of using gore for fear and setting up a scene, and using it for shock or making your story all about it
[0:33:58] <MyNameIsRasus> THIS WOOLIE RULES
[0:34:00] <%CaptainPileDriver> FUCK THIS MAN
[0:34:01] <pixel_river> kill la killa kinda parodies that stuff
[0:34:03] <+BigBruthaThunda> now we must stop because kids are confused
[0:34:04] <seniormeatbox> MORE OF THIS WOOLIE
[0:34:06] <jorniev> JOJO DOESN'T Fetishize GORE thats true
[0:34:06] <+lazygreenjerk2> people really riding elfen lied in 2021 majinoSkiip
[0:34:07] <dundunsun> SUCH A REACH TO COMPARE
[0:34:07] <leith_aziz> Your opinion: DAGA KOTOWARU
[0:34:08] <jamox1> Shin Woolie is fucking unstoppable
[0:34:08] <%jinking79> both characters have stand doodLUL
[0:34:13] <%Wulfphelz> LUL
[0:34:13] <fuji_92> yeah, the book goes OOF
[0:34:14] <+MightyDuckShoes> I remember JoJo having a graphic rape scene that actually did the job of being fucked up. I remember when that one guy in part 5 gets assaulted and me and everyone else watching felt bad for her. It was framed like horror, not titilation.
[0:34:15] <+BakiinPlaysStuff> I'm really enjoying the Woolie Vs Chat arcs this season
[0:34:15] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Not as good as Jojo... hot take
[0:34:16] <seniormeatbox> SHIN MEGAMI WOOLIE
[0:34:17] <nicversus> Agreed I don't even like Jojo that much, but at least all the violence is in service of a story with objectives and themes, and not just for the sake of the violence
[0:34:17] <MyNameIsRasus> WOOLIE KAI
[0:34:18] <GhoulishCripple> If Araki doesnt have a fetish for killing animals why does he kill a dog and or a cat in each part? they get brutal like in part 5
[0:34:20] <+JacknZack27> Yeah, Woolies super right
[0:34:20] <%JustToWatch> the only comparison to Jojo is the shitty stand ripoffs
[0:34:21] <%paladinstarbuster> COUGH berserk COUGH
[0:34:21] <mr_sups> Elfen Lied fans are in denial. Not even about the quality. But about what it even is.
[0:34:23] <glass_marcus> No Prisoners today
[0:34:23] <%Sparkseid> BR manga gets crazy
[0:34:24] <chll0ne> especially the manga
[0:34:26] <whiteblacklight74> can't we just stop beating around the bush and go straight to saying anime sucks
[0:34:28] <sonofthedeepsouth> Battle Rotale=Fuck'Em Kids
[0:34:30] <huskarl_zap> Now, Beserk
[0:34:31] <+Damie904> I think that was just the era Woolie. hyper adult fetishistic stuff became the breakout hits.
[0:34:35] <super_harley_dude> Wooly versus edgelord love it
[0:34:35] <sonofthedeepsouth> Linger
[0:34:36] <whiteblacklight74> this is what this discussion always turns into
[0:34:36] <+Undenizen> Y'know, since I became a taxidermist it's really taken the thrill out of seeing gore in media. I'm over it now.
[0:34:38] <TheWizardOfWordplay> punished woolie
[0:34:38] <$BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[0:34:39] <bitterpelican> ONE MORE TAKE REJECTED
[0:34:41] <user_naim> It just hits different
[0:34:43] <mortalmanbaby> like blood c
[0:34:43] <%ChoculaUltra> LUL
[0:34:44] <+skyheys> how much ass
[0:34:44] <+BlockingDisabled> There is a Fortnite manga!?
[0:34:45] <%X2Eliah> ANIME IS FOR CREEPS
[0:34:46] <leith_aziz> @MightyDuckShoes: Narancia's mom ?
[0:34:47] <%BlueJoneleth> I watched Battle Royale with my mom. She liked it. XD
[0:34:47] <velgaduere> can you believe people pay money to make these takes? wild. is this findom? lobosKek
[0:34:49] <MyNameIsRasus> I AM THE BASED INSIDE YOU
[0:34:54] <SpoonJuggler> Hey chat, you can still like Elfen Lied even if Woolie doesn't
[0:34:57] <sonofthedeepsouth> Titty
[0:34:57] <+condemned_15> Woolie gonna whip out the bibble
[0:34:57] <leith_aziz> Yeah that was MK9 in a nutshell
[0:34:57] <%Noonoox12> @Damie904 bullshit
[0:35:01] <+Ancopro> AoT kinda turned me off cause o gore but now apparently i'm missing the best shit ever
[0:35:01] <%Bluwizard21> Woolie they won't get it, they have their fetishes they will defend them to the last
[0:35:03] <DelgotHansto> Araki barely kills that many dogs look at an actual graph of all dog deaths
[0:35:05] <Jaysky> Is it just me noticing thje slight lag on Woolz camera?
[0:35:07] <%paladinstarbuster> Woolie you being grossed out makes it last longer for you
[0:35:08] <viciousgrim> so it's like gore in horror movie vs gore in hostel
[0:35:09] <%kullumanati> It‚Äôs the Last of Us argument? Are you moving the characters this way for a point or just being risky to say‚Äù look look did you see that‚Äù.?
[0:35:13] <%Stupid121v2> I try to be open minded about any manga but Elfin Leid is just so bad.
[0:35:15] <OldManDeckardCain> jojo does zoom in on both gore and man titty tho Kappa
[0:35:15] <leith_aziz> Nice !
[0:35:18] <pixel_river> nice
[0:35:20] <Asuterisuku> I'm so happy I-No's back in the game but I still think I'm gonna play Giovanna.
[0:35:20] <%LCLSmoothie> nice
[0:35:21] <leith_aziz> THATS GOOD
[0:35:21] <amiavamp> The key difference between gore porn and effective use of gore is that one is shocking, the other is also emotionally shocking
[0:35:22] <%Wulfphelz> Araki literally says he uses animal deaths to help set up how a villian is the scum of the earth
[0:35:23] <@Menitta> IT DRUGS
[0:35:25] <rytisone> made by that evil guy from Evil Within 2
[0:35:25] <%CaptainPileDriver> STRIVE IS SO DELICIOUS
[0:35:25] <leith_aziz> Ive been a fan
[0:35:27] <$BallerSwagBro9k> IMO if gore and brutality turns you on sexualy. You need psychological help
[0:35:27] <%doomerskeletor13> Woolie has converted another person
[0:35:27] <+MrMediocrity> It's a question of irreverance; It's definitely fetishised to an extend in BR but that's meant to be a play on the fact society is fetishising the games
[0:35:27] <@Solidus_113> IT'S SO NICE
[0:35:30] <srv4254> stop the arguing and just watch bible black everybody
[0:35:31] <%Stupid121v2> Strive looks so good
[0:35:31] <Asuterisuku> STRIVE IS DRUGS
[0:35:31] <NoireRequiem> Did woolie like DMCB?

[0:35:32] <%reknownblackcat> @woolieversus are you going to be doing the combat challenges on stream?

[0:35:53] <OldManDeckardCain> minh is too lazy?
[0:35:54] <+MightyDuckShoes> @leith_aziz The lade that got killed by the Birther stand and the scene where Mistah stops a rape. Each scene makes sure to depict the event as being horrible. It doesnt try to throw some spicy shit.
[0:35:54] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Araki isn't the only one who uses Dog Death to show "villain", I just can't ttalk about the latest mainstream example

[0:36:46] <leith_aziz> And im somebody who takes story into matter, even for FG's. So thanks Woolie
[0:36:47] <Jaysky> That's cause Blood C is just violence for violence
[0:36:51] <+MrMediocrity> better to ask forgiveness than permission
[0:36:51] <bitterpelican> One thing I just need to understand - are they going to do a separate movie-story for Strive or is it going to be a playable mode?

[0:39:01] <+samuraiknack> Why is it always Brian?
[0:39:01] <Grzy514> @frostyjay3 don't think so, this should be minute 0
[0:39:01] <%ZweihanderSteve> anime fans are hilarious
[0:39:01] <Kiryurules> JoJo's gore is meant for shock and horror
[0:39:01] <leith_aziz> Fuck Chocolatta
[0:39:03] <Manmush> m6kwD3
[0:39:03] <meganicmp3> my man defending his gore fetish live
[0:39:05] <ExpressNode> I'm actually reading part 4 right now
[0:39:05] <+Neerb25> When DIO kicks a cat into a million pieces it's half shock-horror half unintentionally hilarious. But no one's jacking off to it.
[0:39:06] <+cinder_chan> elfen lied is considered gurro?
[0:39:07] <%Noonoox12> Anything with naked lolis instantly loses
[0:39:08] <Clundy> Let‚Äôs get back to Woolie‚Äôs Shrodingers Urethra problem
[0:39:09] <TheWizardOfWordplay> how can this be safe for the people of Gotham?
[0:39:10] <Murdercles> he's not saying it is exactly the same, the point is that if you can accept some of the things in Jojo, you can accept some of the things in Elfen
[0:39:10] <%Uncle_Christian> wooliePOYO
[0:39:10] <SophisticHades> wow people hating on a man named brian

[0:39:15] <+skyheys> BERSERK. The horse fuck is nasty but not horny
[0:39:15] <Futurecity10> Cheer500 elfin lied fans are the kid in you computer class or anime club that dates the autistic girl who thinks she‚Äôs a vampire. The same kid who tells you in the middle of a quiet classroom to watch high school of the dead because the titties are amazing
[0:39:18] <huskarl_zap> lol we've gone back 15 minutes
[0:39:22] <sonofthedeepsouth> The Boys COMIC IS THE SHIT
[0:39:24] <orpleborple> its not the content, it‚Äôs how the content is framed
[0:39:26] <leith_aziz> Thats MK9

[0:39:27] <masterfire23> gore not guro
[0:39:29] <%L3m0nTwi5t> woolieONEGUY Brian keeping Woolie from peeing woolieSHOOK
[0:39:32] <jorniev> THE SHOW IS an improvement cause the comic is TOO much
[0:39:33] <Nero270> Is Berserk closer to Elfen Lied than to JoJos based off of having those fixated scenes/panels? @WoolieVersus
[0:39:35] <%CaptainPileDriver> woolie go take your piss out elsewhere
[0:39:36] <%Stupid121v2> Naked loli's are an immediate "NO" anyway
[0:39:36] <NoireRequiem> Berserk never wants you to jerk off to it
[0:39:38] <daniphofani> Why does chat egregiously bad takes against Woolie this week
[0:39:40] <%Jiggisnipe> @Murdercles he also said he didn't really like Elfen Lied's story or premise
[0:39:41] <+TheotherKristian> Jojo does not want you to masturbate to its gore
[0:39:42] <quamdunk> Berserk is in another realm
[0:39:44] <meganicmp3> the comic did not age well
[0:39:44] <rosemon5001> literally never lingers like you say but mkay
[0:39:45] <%Wulfphelz> Elfin lied fans is babys first adult anime
[0:39:46] <+RiverKing13> Some people don't understand the difference and it sucks

[0:40:02] <chll0ne> @noirerequiem that wont stop ppl tho cmonBruh Kappa
[0:40:06] <%X2Eliah> So why are so many Animes such creepfests?
[0:40:09] <amiavamp> When I write I make a point specifically to avoid edginess, even in horrible scenes
[0:40:09] <A_CD_By_Thomas> @daniphofani We need to drive him insane before he can enter the Asylum, apparently.
[0:40:11] <+johnnychopsocky> Let Woolie empty himself already, Brian!

[0:40:21] <%Lion_kun> I would argue the Boys is tasteless as well. Not as much as Elfin Leid but it has its lows.
[0:40:22] <quamdunk> DEAR GOD

[0:46:35] <+Flunkorg> Based PC
[0:46:36] <meganicmp3> NICE
[0:46:36] <%TopTieramisu> oof*
[0:46:37] <joshujostar> nice original with nvidia effects
[0:46:37] <NoireRequiem> You punch people sober, like Yakuza Kappa
[0:46:38] <NewWillinium> I was expecting the Remake. But I'm also fine with this.
[0:46:39] <+Masked_Hero_Lucky> Heck yeah, Bamham
[0:46:39] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Remaster, not remakle
[0:46:39] <%wibbwobbler> og is better fuck yes

[0:46:43] <velgaduere> we're just trying to look out for you, Woolz (also our eyes)
[0:46:43] <%Exiliator> Nice pecks woolieGASM
[0:46:43] <jamox1> OG
[0:46:44] <Astrophizz> get that physx smoke
[0:46:44] <user_naim> Lovely Woolie
[0:46:48] <%kyh9> are yeou ready to FEEL like batman?
[0:46:49] <+RiverKing13> There is probably mod for the updated textures
[0:46:49] <+PerrinIsDead> It looks great still
[0:46:53] <disflipmat> Wait we're not playing Armored Edition on Wii U?
[0:46:55] <+GenesisKnight> SUBTITLES YES
[0:46:55] <meganicmp3> even his face is better in the original
[0:46:56] <%runegod20> i don't know why but all the different save files being a different batman headshot makes me laugh
[0:46:56] <Halospaz117> This game still has one of the best looking default Batsuits
[0:46:56] <$JobbedBone> give us OMEGALUL BibleThump
[0:46:57] <ralphfromdk> subs, not dubs LUL
[0:46:58] <+johnnychopsocky> Twitch wasn't prepared
[0:47:03] <%KeiganOfAstora> Invert Camera like a real gamer
[0:47:03] <jorniev> gooooiid dammed batman
[0:47:03] <amiavamp> This game looks great for its age. much better than, say, kingdoms of amalur
[0:47:04] <orpleborple> but is woolie the hero we deserve?
[0:47:04] <DatAsuna> nice that it puts subs right there
[0:47:05] <+even_the_yuenglings> SUBS
[0:47:06] <%doomerskeletor13> The exaggerated swagger of a white billionaire
[0:47:06] <%Davos_Southway> Great game
[0:47:07] <joshujostar> asylum's still the best among three
[0:47:09] <%r0chelimit> Bat titties
[0:47:09] <sonofthedeepsouth> Correct
[0:47:10] <+Neerb25> Arkham Collection is so sad, they really botched the lighting. But it's still playable if it's your only option (which on PC it isn't).
[0:47:12] <MyNameIsRasus> SUPER BLACK
[0:47:13] <Halospaz117> I can see it tho
[0:47:14] <%TopTieramisu> super black
[0:47:15] <sonofthedeepsouth> BLACK
[0:47:15] <+Damie904> We can see it.
[0:47:16] <RyuuAoi> HOLY FUCK WE IN
[0:47:19] <Kiryurules> SUPER BLACK
[0:47:20] <@Solidus_113> Asylum is gritty as fuck
[0:47:20] <clack14> Super black
[0:47:21] <LordOfThePoultry> i can see it
[0:47:21] <+TechnoSyndrome> PC version looks so much better than the remasters
[0:47:21] <%Mattais88> Bat Nipples
[0:47:21] <%Noonoox12> Darkest Africa
[0:47:22] <%KeiganOfAstora> You can also just adjust your TV
[0:47:22] <meganicmp3> darkest night
[0:47:22] <%Exiliator> Subtitles: "no"?
[0:47:22] <%Stupid121v2> Bracku
[0:47:23] <Sternieliscious> Gonna need those bat-nipples from Forever.
[0:47:23] <xdeathknightx> super black
[0:47:25] <seniormeatbox> SUPER BlacK?
[0:47:25] <brunoberserk> '' I am vengeance . I am the night.''
[0:47:27] <JZPotter> lighting is way better in the remaster, at least on PS4
[0:47:27] <Halospaz117> DO I HAVE SUPER EYES?
[0:47:30] <Halospaz117> oh
[0:47:32] <jorniev> that
[0:47:33] <+queaks> Never played this game
[0:47:34] <%slandracon> You better be using a controller @WoolieVersus
[0:47:34] <clack14> darker than black super black
[0:47:34] <quamdunk> Da darkness
[0:47:35] <Jaxnos> yeah, on stream we see a gray bat logo
[0:47:36] <%hazardousmidget> I can see it
[0:47:37] <$dudedude55555> hard mode: turn off screen
[0:47:37] <NoireRequiem> Black noir dark
[0:47:38] <%KeiganOfAstora> Wow
[0:47:39] <jorniev> oh
[0:47:39] <+warlockwithapixie> uh oh
[0:47:40] <+GingerStrawhat> Remember Everyone Black is Violence!
[0:47:41] <Asuterisuku> Make it good for you.
[0:47:41] <brian_peppers1> DAT OLED
[0:47:42] <%KeiganOfAstora> Too bright for us
[0:47:43] <+Reverend_Roscoe> PERFECT
[0:47:44] <amiavamp> Does the recording still wash out colors on his tv?
[0:47:45] <meganicmp3> darkness is spreading
[0:47:45] <+JacknZack27> I never liked how the later games moved towards more realistic bat suits.
[0:47:45] <Clundy> The fake hdr filter ruined the remake in places
[0:47:45] <%runegod20> it took me a second to notice it
[0:47:45] <$Gorotheninja> Cheer500 Hey Woolie and Reg, is it true that Black People have glowing eyeball weakpoints hidden on their bodies? I'm asking for a friend.
[0:47:46] <LVL1_Scumbag> huh
[0:47:47] <TheWizardOfWordplay> whole game will be in detective vision anyway
[0:47:48] <rytisone> tv probably has hdr on
[0:47:48] <orpleborple> i see bat nipples but where is the bat ass?!
[0:47:49] <%Stupid121v2> fuck us make it good for you
[0:47:55] <meganicmp3> that is alright
[0:47:55] <Asuterisuku> Lighting is important in this game.
[0:47:56] <GroundControl138> up the tv brightness
[0:47:56] <%X2Eliah> @orpleborple below
[0:47:58] <dinnydanny777> What a sexy chest
[0:47:59] <Prevot> sounds like your tv is too dark then
[0:48:05] <user_naim> Fuck us, you do you
[0:48:05] <%KeiganOfAstora> You do you, we can adjust our TVs
[0:48:07] <marvel877> Is the tv's lighting set right?
[0:48:07] <sonofthedeepsouth> screen experience requiem
[0:48:08] <+queaks> Does this game have Batbutt?
[0:48:08] <Tuna_Can_0> @TheWizardOfWordplay this is the true way
[0:48:08] <%paladinstarbuster> turn up thetv brightness
[0:48:09] <DatAsuna> yeyeye tv calibration hours
[0:48:10] <pixel_river> batman is buff af in this game
[0:48:11] <NewWillinium> I *hate* this kind of Brightness test. I can never tell what *they* mean by barely seen.
[0:48:11] <GhoulishCripple> we gotta hire Batman to help solve Reggie's hair
[0:48:11] <%X2Eliah> yeah super dark recordings are bad for youtube
[0:48:15] <whirly25> battities
[0:48:17] <andre11dr> Man im so tempted to just shit on everything bad DC did with Batman this past decade but ill hold on
[0:48:17] <%KeiganOfAstora> "about here" as in at the max LUL
[0:48:18] <Indigo_Automaton> As long as you can see it's cool
[0:48:19] <user_naim> Youtube darkens anyway right
[0:48:19] <+chiazam> THE COLOR BLACK IS IMPORTANT
[0:48:20] <RyuuAoi> Recalibrate your tv. Call Pat. MrDestructoid
[0:48:22] <%KeiganOfAstora> I always keep it at middle
[0:48:22] <+skyheys> ITS NEVER RIGHT
[0:48:22] <%Livelinne> Oppai shiaHug
[0:48:23] <whirly25> batitties
[0:48:23] <amiavamp> turn that shit up in Nioh
[0:48:25] <meganicmp3> i hate reading
[0:48:25] <%X2Eliah> Like a lot of black and near black areas are BAD on youtube vids
[0:48:27] <+Willdog1993> He has to "Perfectly Calibrate" his TV
[0:48:27] <sonofthedeepsouth> DEFINE BARELY
[0:48:29] <fuji_92> woolieKICKDAD_BW
[0:48:30] <dinnydanny777> But that setting is always wrong though
[0:48:31] <exnuart> anime viewers gonna get the better experience
[0:48:32] <ZE_Count> WHOAAAA THE DEATH NOTE LP
[0:48:34] <+RiverKing13> Woolie needs get GeekSquad to adjust his tv settings
[0:48:35] <@Solidus_113> Brightness settings are bad 90% of the time. Capcom only has the good tests now
[0:48:36] <sonofthedeepsouth> fucked
[0:48:41] <+evbites> Yeah my tv has that problem
[0:48:41] <+Neerb25> Brightness up so the chat doesn't get scared. Spooky asylum game.
[0:48:42] <DelgotHansto> Bat Crotch
[0:48:44] <@akuda_bar> also colors are subjective
[0:48:45] <%KeiganOfAstora> fair enough
[0:48:45] <jorniev> who cares ITS JUST gonna BE SKELETONS 90% of the game
[0:48:48] <orpleborple> i wanna see things - Reggie Gaston
[0:48:56] <%Javaa01> @Solidus_113 And even their brightness test kinda blows for HDR
[0:48:57] <Asuterisuku> It gets worse when you factor in HDR.
[0:48:57] <ContainsSodium> Bat Gooch
[0:48:58] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I wonder if I should boost the gamma or brightness on Control so things stop sneaking up on me
[0:48:59] <+samuraiknack> This is Why Pat has a perfectly calibrated TV
[0:48:59] <ShadowArcangel> I like my games dark so I generally just go with the default and ignore it and may change it later
[0:49:00] <RyuuAoi> The more you know
[0:49:01] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Brightness all the way up for x-ray vision
[0:49:03] <mattdaddyd101> yeah i hate words to reggie
[0:49:04] <caffeinatedboy> Woolie dropping that knowledge
[0:49:05] <+vaderxyz1970> I play on Potatoe
[0:49:14] <+nabs2099> @jorniev LMAO true. the Arkham games never fixed the over reliance on detective mode
[0:49:16] <peachy996> Oh yeah it's impossible to stay out of Detective Mode
[0:49:17] <%ValentineWolf7> @Solidus_113 what does Capcom do different in terms of brightness settings?
[0:49:20] <%KeiganOfAstora> no
[0:49:20] <+even_the_yuenglings> the arkham games are so good
[0:49:21] <dinnydanny777> Play on the CRT someone dumped around the corner that you took in
[0:49:22] <Kiryurules> WE IN
[0:49:24] <%runegod20> I feel like generally you can go a bit brighter than they recommend and be good
[0:49:26] <Asuterisuku> Skip Origins.
[0:49:27] <%KeiganOfAstora> Arkham Origins!!!!
[0:49:27] <@Menitta> Origins between Knight and City
[0:49:28] <sonofthedeepsouth> Arkham Knight
[0:49:28] <Torgue_1> Origins before Knight
[0:49:28] <$Gorotheninja> Is this a Daredevil game?
[0:49:29] <LordOfThePoultry> LTES GOOO
[0:49:29] <%cache_22> I just wish Brightness, Contrast, and HDR were all set well at a system level.
[0:49:29] <A_CD_By_Thomas> This opening's so great.
[0:49:30] <+condemned_15> Origins first
[0:49:30] <%Chatterbox1991> Orgins than Knight
[0:49:31] <brunoberserk> want to see a game with fucked up brightness ? play circle of the moon in OG GBA ,THEY FUCKED UP
[0:49:31] <%KeiganOfAstora> Knight is last
[0:49:31] <@Menitta> Origins is good
[0:49:32] <Estwilde> Reggie just wants that nightvision gamma cheat! :D
[0:49:32] <rytisone> City Origins Knight
[0:49:32] <%runegod20> origins is between city and knight
[0:49:33] <%Javaa01> Origins is a pseudo prequel to this
[0:49:33] <Halospaz117> Origins then Knight
[0:49:33] <+Reverend_Roscoe> CITY IS GOOD
[0:49:34] <%CaptainPileDriver> origins first then knight and knight still sucks
[0:49:34] <sonofthedeepsouth> Origins is a peequ
[0:49:34] <KnightAsteran> Origins is a prequel
[0:49:34] <frostyjay3> And a 3DS game
[0:49:35] <%ShinobiPhoenix> and then Knight because we don't acknowledge Origins
[0:49:35] <Darren716> Origins is a prequel that came before Knight
[0:49:35] <+spardanwarrior> Asylum, City, Origins, Knight
[0:49:36] <quamdunk> Wahhhhht
[0:49:37] <+queaks> Numbers are good
[0:49:37] <%Stupid121v2> This first hour is stellar
[0:49:44] <super_harley_dude> I had that problem back in the day with re2 og
[0:49:44] <PanicSwytch> ORIGINS IS GREAT
[0:49:45] <%Chatterbox1991> @WoolieVersus don't forget Blackgate for Mobile
[0:49:45] <NoireRequiem> origins is a prequel
[0:49:45] <whiteblacklight74> bam ham assylum
[0:49:46] <marvel877> Origins, BY A DIFFERENT DEV TEAM, then Knight.
[0:49:47] <seniormeatbox> Origins is good, watch the cutscenes of blackgate
[0:49:47] <@Menitta> AND THE 3DS GAME
[0:49:47] <%Exiliator> Na-na-na-na-na Batman!
[0:49:47] <Dave_VD> This is a cool game. Haven't revisited it since I was a kid
[0:49:48] <Murdercles> which is the one where Joker becomes a stupid hulk?
[0:49:50] <datara90> its a very good series
[0:49:52] <Asuterisuku> This is a trilogy.
[0:49:53] <peachy996> If you have any appreciation for Bane you will not skip Origins
[0:49:53] <dinnydanny777> So this is about that guy from Devil May Cry right?
[0:49:54] <meganicmp3> arkham babies was underrated asl
[0:49:55] <@Solidus_113> @Solidus_113 In their newer RE Engine games, they have in-depth settings for max and min brightness, along with contrast and gamma
[0:49:55] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Asylum, City, NOTHING, and then Knight
[0:49:55] <%hazardousmidget> Origins is not good
[0:49:56] <bitterpelican> Chronologically it's Origins, Asylum, City and Knight with tie-in comics, I think???
[0:49:56] <jorniev> INTRO IS SO GOOD
[0:49:57] <+PerrinIsDead> This game is SO good
[0:49:57] <+TechnoSyndrome> it was very much "oh this game was popular, work Arkham into every title"
[0:50:00] <Asuterisuku> Asylum, City, Knight.
[0:50:01] <DatAsuna> oh boy the batmobile
[0:50:02] <meganicmp3> THIS INTRO
[0:50:02] <%KeiganOfAstora> @WoolieVersus This game is based off the Grant Morrison graphic novel of the same name
[0:50:02] <quamdunk> Great series
[0:50:05] <DelgotHansto> This game made people confuse Gotham City and Arkham City like they both exist
[0:50:05] <%wibbwobbler> but it's a city
[0:50:06] <NoireRequiem> just an island
[0:50:06] <amiavamp> This looks a lot like SH: Homecoming
[0:50:07] <LordOfThePoultry> YEYEYEYE
[0:50:07] <DatAsuna> I sure wish 60% of the game was that
[0:50:07] <+shootbang_exe> yeah city kinda stretched it and with knight it was kinda laughable imo
[0:50:08] <frostyjay3> I have just been informed that the 3DS game was called Blackgate
[0:50:08] <%X2Eliah> LOOK AT THIS BATMOBILE
[0:50:09] <+queaks> He caused that car to crash>!!>
[0:50:09] <+nabs2099> Arkham Asylum, City, Origins then Knight let's goooooo
[0:50:11] <GhoulishCripple> Arkham Asylum. where Arkham spanks your butt
[0:50:12] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Caught him again.
[0:50:12] <%Feralspirit41> The greatest joker voice right here
[0:50:13] <Ipsenscastle> this batmobile is so much cooler than the one we got
[0:50:14] <%Uncle_Christian> MAYBE ESCAPIES
[0:50:14] <TheChapyGuy> Asylum, City, Origins (prequel), Knight. Origins isn't great, but you can play it for yourself
[0:50:15] <%X2Eliah> NO BULLSHIT TANK, ACTUAL BATMOBILE
[0:50:15] <+johnnychopsocky> For real, Arkham Origins gets more hate than it deserves
[0:50:15] <Prevot> LUL
[0:50:15] <amiavamp> actually Downpour*
[0:50:16] <+Reverend_Roscoe> NO
[0:50:17] <Manmush> LUL
[0:50:19] <+skyheys> lol
[0:50:19] <%toomuchsnarfsnarf> Man I haven‚Äôt played this since it came out

[0:50:22] <%Uncle_Christian> Mark Hamill
[0:50:22] <seniormeatbox> HAMIL
[0:50:23] <xdeathknightx> But that is only if you play the right version of the game ;)
[0:50:23] <%ShinobiPhoenix> does this game have extra costumes?
[0:50:23] <NewWillinium> Riddler Trophies are the worst things in the trilogy
[0:50:23] <%krispen_wa> woolieONEGUY
[0:50:23] <Asuterisuku> MAAAAARK
[0:50:24] <%KeiganOfAstora> There was a 3DS game?!
[0:50:25] <%hazardousmidget> even Rocksteady denies it a place in the arkham collection nowadays, they only sell the three good ones
[0:50:26] <+Neerb25> You can tell Arkham Origins is by a different developer because it's the only one where the title isn't a literal thing in the game.
[0:50:27] <$BallerSwagBro9k> MARK THE MAN
[0:50:28] <jorniev> maaark
[0:50:29] <Halospaz117> MARKING OUT FOR MARK

[0:51:00] <%KeiganOfAstora> Mark Hamill, what about Kevin FUCKING Conroy?
[0:51:02] <%Uncle_Christian> Sharpie
[0:51:02] <DelgotHansto> They've probably tried
[0:51:03] <whiteblacklight74> joaquin phoenix in a batman game when

[0:51:06] <%megaman_sentinel> best Joker ever
[0:51:06] <%KeiganOfAstora> This looks fine
[0:51:07] <quamdunk> I‚Äôm da jokah baybee
[0:51:08] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @KeiganOfAstora Blackgate is a Metroidvania
[0:51:08] <YaminoRaiden> All the BTAS voices are here
[0:51:09] <LVL1_Scumbag> Who's gonna pull over Batman?
[0:51:09] <%runegod20> phil lamar?
[0:51:09] <AvroEltz> He is rich, so, no
[0:51:10] <+nabs2099> Vanilla Joker is the only time I don't immediately think "Society"
[0:51:11] <NoireRequiem> justice has no limit
[0:51:12] <%hazardousmidget> Well he doesnt have a licence plate
[0:51:13] <%Stupid121v2> This game looked great on release and still holds up GREAT
[0:51:13] <CursedNobleman> MARK HAMIL

[0:51:19] <andre11dr> Mark usually is Joker in games
[0:51:22] <%KeiganOfAstora> This is on PS5 or PC?
[0:51:22] <+samuraiknack> Imagine Woolie just said stream over
[0:51:23] <mr_sups> oh, Tom Kane. I feel so bad for him

[0:51:24] <whirly25> honk his nose
[0:51:25] <+JaseAdrift> He has no License plate
[0:51:26] <bitterpelican> Hamill is great and all, but we need the best Joker in next game - Tommy Wiseau
[0:51:26] <Asuterisuku> Blind in one eye, scars across his face, they clearly have history.

[0:52:03] <Asuterisuku> Ah yeah, Bruce taking up a full fifth of the screen.
[0:52:04] <heart_ablaze> oh maaaan the nostalgia is so strong
[0:52:05] <meganicmp3> god this aged perfectly

[0:52:08] <$Gorotheninja> Kivin Connely
[0:52:08] <+FuqBoiSlim> GRAVITY SQUEEZE
[0:52:09] <%KeiganOfAstora> This is basically Batman The Animated Series The Game. You got the Voice Actors, the writer Paul Dini, and the music too
[0:52:09] <bitterpelican> Kevin Conroy is on par with Simon Templeman from Legacy of Cain in terms of that commanding strong voice
[0:52:09] <andre11dr> I'm pretty sure they bring the cast back to voice everyone in Injustice
[0:52:10] <Lancaster_H> fuck i love mark hamill
[0:52:11] <$JobbedBone> THAT VOICE WHO IS THAT
[0:52:13] <%Stupid121v2> oh fuck that is that KOTOR voice lmao
[0:52:13] <NewWillinium> Is it just me or does Arkham Asylum have that kind of look where it almost feels like someone put vaseline on the screen and tried to clean it up?
[0:52:15] <+even_the_yuenglings> is that guy in the clone wars?
[0:52:16] <DatAsuna> bad news about that mr mayor
[0:52:16] <quamdunk> Asylum is soo freaking good such a fun experience

[0:52:26] <seniormeatbox> @JobbedBone All I hear is the clone wars intro

[0:52:26] <JZPotter> walk forward
[0:52:26] <deviljhojho_> perhaps
[0:52:27] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> that VA is Kavar, right??
[0:52:28] <%X2Eliah> @NewWillinium oh yeah
[0:52:31] <+ReallyBigRocks> The warden is also the narrator for Star Wars The Clone Wars
[0:52:31] <%Sparkseid> Magneto out here running AA

[0:52:48] <+condemned_15> Tom Kane was also in Clone Wars. He's also Professor Utonium

[0:55:42] <dinnydanny777> Have you tried downloading DirectX 9?
[0:55:42] <RyuuAoi> TIME TO UPGRADE

[0:55:49] <rytisone> your hardware cant run GTA 4 either
[0:55:50] <user_naim> This bodes well for the future
[0:55:51] <+Pop_O_Matic> Just buy a PhysX card. They still make those, right?
[0:55:51] <$JobbedBone> I remember WANTING a GTX BibleThump
[0:55:51] <+nomad390> 9800 fuck yeah
[0:55:52] <BadassKirby> Sounds like it doesn't exist with the new card anymore
[0:55:53] <+skyheys> WB doing shit for specific cards
[0:55:53] <+retro_godfather> it's like how you have to lower your cores to play Lost Planet 2
[0:55:54] <$ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> I played this game on a WHITE 360, what the fuck is wrong with the PC version? The console overheated and shut down way more often than the game itself crashed
[0:55:54] <huskarl_zap> Nvidea will never surpass 980 gtx ti KEK
[0:55:54] <@Solidus_113> Physx isn't always optimized, it's always been bad and can't be brute forced

[0:56:11] <meganicmp3> hell yeah
[0:56:12] <thatangryguyofde> oops big problem
[0:56:12] <%SainEdge> @WoolieVersus a lot of older games now have problems with physics, because they use old versions. Mirrors Edge for example LUL
[0:56:12] <amiavamp> Underclocking is really useful for getting the same power out of less voltage/heat/noise

[0:56:34] <dinnydanny777> I love the Nvidia logo LUL
[0:56:38] <%runegod20> I'm reminded of Grimm Fandango, where if your computer was strong enough, a puzzle in the game would be broken because the game is too fast, which forces you to underclock
[0:56:39] <Estwilde> Nvidia drivers probably mess up the old PhysX libraries
[0:56:39] <meganicmp3> its fine
[0:56:40] <velgaduere> Artesian Builds SWEATING LOUDLY
[0:56:42] <%Kriss1827> @woolieversus just like in yakuza cart racing, too much power

[0:56:43] <YaminoRaiden> @SaiyanShoto you gotta be fucking me? WB games SUCK on PC
[0:56:44] <Adwark> PhysX was specific tech of older Nvidia GPUs, not surprised that after years of progress of tech there are issues with handling old versions of it.
[0:56:44] <%ShinobiPhoenix> didn't even get to save, unless it autosaved
[0:56:45] <+Reverend_Roscoe> this music though

[0:58:15] <Indigo_Automaton> The artstyle helps
[0:58:18] <%KeiganOfAstora> 2000 - 2010 was huge
[0:58:18] <%cursedwithadhd> so is this whole thing because the remaster isn't playable on PS5

[1:07:19] <@Commando_Joe> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli they kept her original cartoon VA for the first game, but she was out of practice so she was replaced by Tara in 2
[1:07:19] <Asuterisuku> Don't mash the button. Hit it once, then see where he goes.
[1:07:19] <@Solidus_113> the Flow Combat System
[1:07:20] <deviljhojho_> not bad
[1:07:20] <+Radkon> XXXY time

[1:07:52] <Jaysky> The counter animations are sick
[1:07:53] <lonosi55> What difficulty

[1:08:02] <+FuqBoiSlim> The combat system that western action games shamelessly copied for a whole decade
[1:08:03] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> its a rhythym game
[1:08:03] <OldManDeckardCain> tbh, I thought that this lp was just a bait and woolie would just make a let's watch of death note to mess ith pat LUL
[1:08:06] <Kiryurules> RIDER KICK
[1:08:10] <+vaderxyz1970> Remember Batman doesn't kill people
[1:08:11] <%kewlmyc> After playing Spiderman, I forgot how slow this first Batman game feels combat wise
[1:08:11] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> its literally just a rhythm game
[1:08:11] <%Exiliator> Yeah kick that air!
[1:08:12] <DatAsuna> from 3 onwards it got a lot more arkham
[1:08:14] <deviljhojho_> yeah cycling them is usually the best choice
[1:08:14] <jorniev> BATMAN KICK
[1:08:14] <%Mrthefro> Whiffing a counter breaks combo IIRC
[1:08:14] <emeraldskrull> i can't decide if i want to manga or anime this...
[1:08:16] <+Story_Ark> i know its aged now but back in the day, this game was sooo dope.
[1:08:16] <%doomerskeletor13> I think Arleen got some kind of cancer and retired
[1:08:18] <TheWizardOfWordplay> it's black flag combat
[1:08:18] <%KeiganOfAstora> Cuz of this game
[1:08:18] <peachy996> It's weird at first but when you get used to it, you are Batgod
[1:08:19] <DSD24> This is the Shadow of Mordor System
[1:08:20] <%AnthroMetal> Batman doesn't kill anyone
[1:08:21] <iamtheTwitchghost> prince of persia sands of time had it first
[1:08:21] <dustworthmain> this combat system has been copied so many times now
[1:08:22] <bitterpelican> The sound design for punches is just perfect
[1:08:22] <%Uncle_Christian> Tara is bland
[1:08:22] <+MightyDuckShoes> Ooh! I love Sploderman!!
[1:08:22] <dinnydanny777> Kicked in the head unconscious
[1:08:25] <NoireRequiem> had counters in city were so sick too
[1:08:25] <Darren716> Yeah every game in the 360 gen ripped off this game's combat
[1:08:26] <+gustavozxd> arkham knight's combat gets pretty tough
[1:08:27] <DelgotHansto> Batman kills 0 people this game
[1:08:28] <@Solidus_113> Asylum was the first
[1:08:28] <%HollowedIdjit> @oldmandeckardcain that would have been the best
[1:08:32] <%TheBensonator_> How to be Batman, step 1: do combo
[1:08:33] <deviljhojho_> brain damage doesnt count as killing so its fine tomatoSmile
[1:08:34] <seniormeatbox> @DSD24 More or less Mordor took thisd
[1:08:35] <crowned_martian> god I remember playing the Demo on PS3 and being absolutely blown tf away . this is next gen gameplay!
[1:08:36] <RyuuAoi> Does it feel like Ghost of Tsunami? KappaClaus
[1:08:37] <+shootbang_exe> lmao is wb gonna patent batman combat next
[1:08:37] <SaiyanShoto> Arkham combat is just Spider-Man 2 combat
[1:08:37] <YaminoRaiden> Any whiff button is an instant combo dropped
[1:08:38] <NoireRequiem> *hard
[1:08:39] <FrostedZaibatsu> Spiderman combat
[1:08:43] <coreybom> @kewlmyc Makes sense in canon. Spiderman is a FAST son of a bitch.
[1:08:45] <exnuart> spiderman ps4 combat
[1:08:49] <Minerslovegames> Combat system in this is so crisp.
[1:08:51] <Jaxnos> it BEGINS
[1:08:54] <%Pillagius> Aaactually one of the very first cases of such "soft lock on" combat I can remember was Matrix: Path of Neo
[1:08:56] <JZPotter> Conroy must have had a cold during recording this, he sounds off for a lot of it
[1:08:57] <StarlitStunner> stripGo Bat time brother @deviljhojho_
[1:08:57] <Asuterisuku> Don't leave this room yet!

[1:09:08] <RealDurdyDan> @Pillagius That game was so janky yet so fun
[1:09:09] <Kiryurules> Art Kreygasm
[1:09:10] <%AnthroMetal> Batman doesn't kill ppl, Kiryu doesn't kill ppl, Batman is Kiryu confirmed
[1:09:12] <%slandracon> READ THESE @WoolieVersus
[1:09:14] <AvroEltz> Read the item lore

[1:09:15] <PKSomething> oh shti good art
[1:09:16] <%CaptainPileDriver> you get a LOT of these for so many characters
[1:09:16] <StarkAvKnark> Reggie lore master
[1:09:16] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> the second game onwards didnt have comic art
[1:09:17] <%ShinobiPhoenix> including everything that happened in Gotham the showo
[1:09:17] <peachy996> And these designs are wonderful
[1:09:17] <prime_name> That's a real detective coat
[1:09:18] <%runegod20> wasn't aware there was unique art like that, Gordon's looking like an extra fine Sigma
[1:09:18] <KgKid51> drip?
[1:09:18] <Punareff> i love the character art in this
[1:09:19] <$Gorotheninja> Arkham basically homogenized 3d action combat
[1:09:20] <bitterpelican> @pillagius Which is surprisingly a GREAT game for what it was
[1:09:20] <Prevot> that's good art
[1:09:21] <hazeprojekt> Just Remember Batmans right arm is bigger than his left in all the arkham Games
[1:09:22] <alphalejandro> James "Big Boss" Gordon
[1:09:23] <ZE_Count> what facts
[1:09:23] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Surprised they never tried these in the following games.
[1:09:24] <%robo_trunk> Super Nice Bio Art
[1:09:24] <$eco419> Yeyeyeyeye
[1:09:26] <jorniev> art is pretty good
[1:09:26] <+Story_Ark> so majima is joker?
[1:09:30] <frostyjay3> @vaderxyz1970 Hay man brutally beating the shit put of criminals to the point of doing life threatening damage to their bones and organs, etc is definitely NOT killing people.
[1:09:30] <+JaseAdrift> oooooh art
[1:09:31] <dinnydanny777> That art is sick
[1:09:32] <wendigo172> @jzpotter he sounds off in all the Arkham games
[1:09:33] <deviljhojho_> the art in these was real solid
[1:09:34] <Komayeda> First Appearance
[1:09:34] <mr_sups> I wish that the In game art matched this art.
[1:09:34] <crowned_martian> Batman Arkham Asylum, Sleeping Dogs, Ghost of Tsushima, and Spiderman 2018 yeyeye boy those were the good days
[1:09:34] <%Th3SmartAlec> DAMN

[1:09:42] <NewWillinium> BULLSHIT that man is 180
[1:09:43] <%Mkingston> This game puts far more effort into the lore that it had any need to. Love it.
[1:09:43] <+gustavozxd> where's his bust size

[1:14:04] <BlackermanZX> kiling joke ruined robin thats for sure Keepo
[1:14:04] <+Story_Ark> the only bad thing about killing joke is the movie
[1:14:04] <mdkcde> BRIAN!, It was YOU AGAIN?
[1:14:06] <brachydios777> The point is that the origin isn‚Äôt clear it‚Äôs real
[1:14:06] <jorniev> one guy talking about the animated movie probably
[1:14:06] <heart_ablaze> one REALLY WRONG guy
[1:14:07] <DatAsuna> Killing joke itself was good, people say that because of the years of killing joke wannabe writers
[1:14:07] <prime_name> I think they might be talking about the animated thing
[1:14:08] <AvroEltz> Stop incentivizing one guy
[1:14:10] <SpoonJuggler> Killing Joke is to this day the only comic I've ever bought. It's great.

[1:14:19] <+JumboCrunchies> Killing joke is rad, and the Origin story is one of many. You aren't supposed to believe it.
[1:14:20] <%Lion_kun> Alan Moore hates the Killi g
[1:14:23] <velgaduere> Batman's got his number

[1:14:29] <%ShinobiPhoenix> wait until we get to Hugo Strange, still waiting for him in the movies
[1:14:29] <%doomerskeletor13> That‚Äôs Alan Moore‚Äôs opinion on Killing Joke, he wishes he had never written it now
[1:14:29] <peachy996> He's basically Chilton from Silence of the Lambs

[1:27:32] <%KyoryUtchy> I think I read somewhere that she made a choice to not get special treatment, on the grounds that if Batman can fix someone's legs, he should make the technology public to fix EVERYONE'S legs.

[1:27:58] <SpoonJuggler> First appearance is actually Animated Series

[1:28:02] <+nightwing1936> that's her fist comic appearance, she was in the animated series first
[1:28:02] <snakest3alth> She appeared in BTAS
[1:28:04] <%paladinstarbuster> she is from theshow
[1:28:04] <SeruraRenge> The one character that was 100% original to the animated series, and she was voiced by a friend of the show's creators that has a really unique voice
[1:28:04] <+MightyDuckShoes> @KyoryUtchy And Batman did what? Say No?
[1:28:05] <TheCrispyBoi> TAS made her
[1:28:05] <Jaysky> Harley is MORALLY GRAY
[1:28:07] <%Sparkseid> BTAS was her first appearance
[1:28:07] <+GenesisKnight> She was created for the Animated Series
[1:28:07] <+discognition> She originated on BTAS
[1:28:08] <%Dante_Namikaze1> She was on the show first then in the comics
[1:28:11] <+maxteammagus> Started on the show
[1:28:12] <joshua_42> Ivy and Harley are dating I think
[1:28:12] <Shardlab> Full transplant from the show. Harley can get into your head and make you do what she wants.
[1:28:12] <Joestar1890> animated series was at 92 I think
[1:28:13] <+duskrush> she came from the cartoon
[1:28:13] <mudamudajo> She was created in the animated series, THEN brought to the comics.
[1:28:14] <fuji_92> she appeared in TAS before the comics
[1:28:15] <Minerslovegames> Her first appearance in comic form. She actually first appeared in the Animated Series and was ported over into official canon because of how popular she was.
[1:28:15] <%slandracon> She was invented in the animayed, same with Freeze
[1:28:17] <marvel877> TAS first, then comics in 99.

[1:28:22] <%Grimlockfly> She was created on the show
[1:28:22] <%Uncle_Christian> Gaggy, also known as Gagsworth A. Gagsworthy, was the Joker 's original sidekick.
[1:28:23] <%doomerskeletor13> Ye they wanted her and Ivy to have a relationship in the animated show but obviously couldn‚Äôt because of censors
[1:28:28] <%ShinobiPhoenix> The original Harley IS the Animated Series, she was canonized into the comics because she was popular
[1:28:29] <dinnydanny777> Isn't 140 lbs kind of heavy for a gymnast?
[1:28:29] <+NickHatesSnow> she did
[1:28:31] <+Xero_J> @kyoryutchy I mean....if that‚Äôs the case, why not just make the technology public anyway?
[1:28:33] <Adwark> Actually her first appearance was back in 1992 in animated series.

[1:28:39] <+JumboCrunchies> That may be her first *comic* appearance?
[1:28:39] <AncelDeLambert> that issue came out AFTER the animated series episode
[1:28:39] <nvst4rk> She did appear on BTAS first, comic debut was after

[1:29:09] <andre11dr> I do like how they explain later that she was a terrible doctor and that's why it was so easy for Joker to manipulate her
[1:29:12] <%ozzrabbit> She‚Äôs a Animated Series Original
[1:29:15] <%KeiganOfAstora> @WoolieVersus Are you gonna play Arkham City or Arkham Knight?
[1:29:19] <peachy996> By the way Woolie does Oracle sound familiar to you? It's Ash from Mass Effect
[1:29:21] <mdkcde> The comic is from 1999, it's SUPER Wrong
[1:29:22] <+Javatron69> fun fact, an episode of the animated series also inspired the entire plot of batman begins
[1:29:25] <%Exiliator> Yeah I think the game is wrong on this one
[1:29:29] <@Menitta> Remember how Suicide Squad won an oscar

[1:29:48] <+Diamond_Dynamo> Tbf, she's the only character I can think of where it makes a difference
[1:29:51] <SeruraRenge> Batman Beyond's entire setting existed as a cartoon before any comics were made as well

[1:33:40] <whiteblacklight74> batman has never killed anyone
[1:33:44] <%runegod20> i don't think hitting it with what's pretty much a throwing knife would do that batman
[1:33:44] <+Deekman> it feels so silly when gritty batman says he tool names
[1:33:46] <mighty_fine_trousers> pc?
[1:33:51] <+Javatron69> oh my god I just remember the "you didnt play arkham asylum?" converation from the podcast
[1:33:51] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1366630490514595843?s=19
[1:33:52] <%kewlmyc> Yes, PC
[1:33:55] <gunsrlove> Man, Arkham Asylum was way goofier than the others got, City and Knight were all grimdark.
[1:33:56] <+queaks> FIRST TRY
[1:33:56] <Indigo_Automaton> Batman's Stand nullifies brain damage, it's okay
[1:34:00] <%Mrthefro> destroy=power up
[1:34:04] <elshadow7> batarangs are excellent conductors
[1:34:04] <%krispen_wa> Man, Kevin Conroy sounds so much more motivated here than he did for Arkham Knight or Killing Joke
[1:34:08] <peachy996> Dum de dum dum
[1:34:11] <mdkcde> how about that REVOLUTIONARY WiiU Batarang
[1:34:11] <+yukichocomilk> 4Head
[1:34:11] <blaggablag> I dig the subway station style tiling
[1:34:11] <disflipmat> Why is the PA sound effect so evil sounding
[1:34:12] <+Story_Ark> god that dumb cheesy jingle lmao
[1:34:12] <%KeiganOfAstora> I hear that chime and think someone is texting me. I had it as my ringtone for years
[1:34:16] <+PerrinIsDead> i should go back and beat Arkham Knight I actually really enjoyed it
[1:34:17] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[1:34:19] <DelgotHansto> So you won't kill people, but you're fine with permanent brain damage?
[1:34:19] <+cinder_chan> are we going to point out the jason todd room to woolie?
[1:34:19] <nvst4rk> I mean, if I could use batarangs to turn on the lights in my house, I would
[1:34:20] <mankeymania> funny ass joke
[1:34:21] <Kiryurules> SIMP
[1:34:21] <%SentaiGarm> wooo
[1:34:21] <TheWizardOfWordplay> if you hit rb when aiming a gadget you get a cinematic camera
[1:34:25] <+StooEsq> that's a good PA jingle
[1:34:27] <NoireRequiem> FANBOYS
[1:34:28] <Asuterisuku> There's never just one set of teeth in the room.
[1:34:29] <dustworthmain> you couldn't get past this room if you pirated the game. i think the gas would kill you before you could progress
[1:34:30] <Hillthugsta> insanity pleas avoid death penalty
[1:34:35] <+chiazam> Attention: I Have Cake
[1:34:37] <+nomad390> Fun fact: When you pirated this game the game disabled gliding, making this segment impossible to get through.
[1:34:38] <PanicSwytch> You don't have to aim. Just press RT and it auto aims to objects and ppl
[1:34:39] <AncelDeLambert> Woolie needs to learn about the fast tool trick

[1:38:33] <%KeiganOfAstora> Slow mode is too slow
[1:38:34] <Halospaz117> Did you say: Jason Todd?
[1:38:35] <nvst4rk> it's just Jason tho
[1:38:36] <Asuterisuku> And then they get bodied because it's the Joker.
[1:38:37] <+yoscribe> Jason was right
[1:38:39] <%Jiggisnipe> has Jason tried?
[1:38:40] <+chiazam> TO KILL OR NOT TO KILL
[1:38:41] <+AnthonyJMax> Jason Todd
[1:38:42] <+Deekman> break his spine lol
[1:38:42] <diontmack> dub tech
[1:38:43] <coreybom> So chat are a bunch of punisher fans then.
[1:38:43] <Th3rd3> upgeade time!!
[1:38:44] <$Gorotheninja> Jason Todd/ Red Hood
[1:38:47] <+JaseAdrift> Yes become the law and just start murdering people
[1:38:47] <TheWizardOfWordplay> inverted takedown first
[1:38:48] <+patriotrenegade> paralyze him
[1:38:48] <GroundControl138> jason did nothing wrong
[1:38:49] <DatAsuna> Says superman
[1:38:51] <%Zero_Jacks> flashback of Static shock - counter shocking joker
[1:38:51] <+Nekros4442> Jason was right
[1:38:51] <Astrophizz> Azrael
[1:38:53] <%LCLSmoothie> everyone in gotham : JUST KILL JOKER / batman: nahh
[1:38:53] <journeytogetgood> Huntress also
[1:38:56] <NewWillinium> "I'm not talking about Harvey, or Penguin, or Riddler. I'm talking him, just him. . . ."
[1:38:58] <PanicSwytch> JASON DID NOTHING WRONG
[1:38:58] <Jaysky> So Red Hood. Jason is absolutely right to do so, then Batman gives him a lecture.
[1:39:00] <NoireRequiem> they try killing him and get killed hard, or get proven wrong
[1:39:01] <dinnydanny777> Batman needs to punch people in the back of the head repeatedly until they fall unconscious
[1:39:03] <%ThatGuyThere03> and the punisher did that too in a crossover comic
[1:39:03] <Blank9> Why not cripple him?
[1:39:03] <+GenesisKnight> It's not Bruce's job to be executioner. Take it to the courts.
[1:39:04] <StarlitStunner> Prometheus and Hush
[1:39:07] <Tuna_Can_0> just break his legs, kinda hard to commit crimes in a wheelchair
[1:39:09] <OllieMan_XIII> as recent as a few months ago. in the comics, Harley tried to convince him to kill him.
[1:39:12] <%paladinstarbuster> Batman admits he's at fault but he knows that if he kills him then he wont stop.
[1:39:12] <%ShinobiPhoenix> or Damien Wayne
[1:39:18] <joshua_42> Break his spine
[1:39:20] <alphalejandro> Jason was a victim...of Batman
[1:39:21] <AvroEltz> Its my sponsor
[1:39:22] <velgaduere> uhhhhhh BAT-TECH
[1:39:25] <gunsrlove> Just surgically remove his arms, legs and tongue and leave him in a hole.
[1:39:30] <SeruraRenge> goddamnit now I'm thinking of the /co/ meme where Gordon keeps trying to get Batman to rape the Joker if he won't kill him
[1:39:31] <brachydios777> It‚Äôs a thing
[1:39:31] <Darren716> I think he has both
[1:39:31] <+condemned_15> Wayne Enterprises
[1:39:32] <Exodusprime1256> he litterally blew up an orphanage and stabbed children. just do it
[1:39:37] <$emptyantics> RED HOOD had every right to kill Joker
[1:39:39] <glass_marcus> Wayne World
[1:39:39] <CommanderCOOL> Lock up was a villian in Batman TAS that scared the crap outta all of the baddies
[1:39:40] <penitentpendant> Important Note: You don't have to do these 'in order' look through them before commiting
[1:39:42] <%BronxSpyder> yes, become the law and start beating people in ways that normally would kill people
[1:39:44] <fuji_92> Wayne enterprise
[1:39:45] <+AnIrishPapaya> I mean letting someone live only goes so far. After someone's murdered a few upwards of a couple hundred they're just human garbage
[1:39:49] <%wibbwobbler> Bruce Wayne is gonna be pissed
[1:39:50] <%ChronoWave> You may be thinking LexCorp
[1:39:51] <%Exiliator> I mean I cant fully blame batman, he keeps handing Joker to the city right? Can't they just kill him then if they want to?
[1:39:51] <+skyheys> it has many subdivisions
[1:39:53] <+ClericOfSparda> in the new game there's an entire company Wayne Enterprises owns called Batman, Inc.
[1:39:59] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Do Combo.
[1:40:01] <@Solidus_113> there's more
[1:40:02] <$tallik44123> if he really cared the joker would have been lobotomized years ago
[1:40:03] <%chosenjuan42> Wayne Enterprise
[1:40:06] <%krispen_wa> the courts in DC are fucking stupid though. like literally the worst. theres a reason vigilantes exist in that universe.
[1:40:11] <AncelDeLambert> aaaaaaand mistakes were made
[1:40:12] <+JumboCrunchies> @WoolieVersus Wayne Enterprises is the overarching company, WayneTech is the tech side
[1:40:14] <+Diamond_Dynamo> There are more options unlocked already
[1:40:14] <+spardanwarrior> Nope
[1:40:14] <KeiganOfAstora> Good choice
[1:40:15] <%X2Eliah> NO NOT IN SEQUENCE
[1:40:15] <%jepupu> The types are different though
[1:40:18] <Estwilde> Every person murdered or injured by the Joker is on Batman's hands. The regular world has already proven incompetent at containing the Joker.
[1:40:20] <3Xgilly> you dont need to do them in sequence
[1:40:20] <+NerevaRising> It's not in sequence
[1:40:20] <+ShutUpAceyP> there are a bunch you can choose actually
[1:40:26] <%Infernal_Dalek> Infernal_Dalek subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! You haven't seen Death Note!?
[1:40:26] <%slandracon> scroll the list for upgrades
[1:40:27] <dundore77> theres more options
[1:40:27] <jorniev> Why is there no death penalty in gotham?
[1:40:28] <$ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> NOOOOOOOOO, augh the lp tax is too strong
[1:40:28] <Komayeda> It's not in sequence
[1:40:28] <user_naim> Not all in sequence
[1:40:29] <marvel877> Mistakes were made already.
[1:40:29] <+chiazam> KEEP LOOKING
[1:40:29] <peachy996> There was more but you might as well get the throw now
[1:40:32] <LunarRemix> It's a not a sequence Woolie
[1:40:33] <+Weeewer> Woolie gon woolie
[1:40:35] <Doctadaking> Inverted Takedown is integral
[1:40:36] <+RyanTheRecluse> not all in sequence
[1:40:38] <brunoberserk> It's not in sequence
[1:40:39] <Asuterisuku> It's NOT in sequence but you need to get some before you can get others.
[1:40:43] <%Javaa01> The DON'T BUTTON MASH upgrade
[1:40:45] <dinnydanny777> So how has Batman never accidentally killed someone

[1:40:47] <%runegod20> spiderman had that
[1:40:49] <SheefEatsBeef> Rhythm Punch!
[1:40:52] <gigamaid> Show me a person who killed Joker and didn't end up worse for it. Injustice Superman and Jason don't become angels after they off Joker.
[1:40:57] <%HollowedIdjit> If Progress was allowed to happen, Joker would have been executed and Gotham wouldn't be a shit hole
[1:40:57] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:41:01] <armchairmaster_> NOT IN SEQUENCE you can choose your powers in any offer
[1:41:01] <Indigo_Automaton> This game is all about flow and timing
[1:41:04] <@Solidus_113> when your fist connects to the enemy, hit the button again
[1:41:06] <+johnnychopsocky> you were not misled
[1:41:12] <Darren716> Inverted takedown is the shit
[1:41:13] <candidateplays> These Icons are really reminding me of Madworld
[1:41:14] <+supersparta12345> Not mislead. You just didnt look lol
[1:41:15] <alphalejandro> Wayne Tech...learn how to throw bad guys to the ground
[1:41:18] <whiteblacklight74> the inverted takedown is a gamechanger
[1:41:19] <TheWizardOfWordplay> do inverted takedown next
[1:41:19] <PanicSwytch> Not sequence! U can choose gadget, vitality or combat
[1:41:20] <+ScottishMadJacko> Inverted takedown is the best
[1:41:21] <OldManDeckardCain> killing joker - "meh" killing random pedestrians with your batmobile - "hell yeah"
[1:41:22] <+even_the_yuenglings> inverted takedown is really good
[1:41:23] <+grbunnys> More combo meter if you hit on a rhythm
[1:41:35] <Onehandstan> the takedown abilities and gadget abilities are the funnest
[1:41:35] <mudamudajo> I'd recommend unlocking the combo stuff first. Special takedown will be paramount!
[1:41:37] <devanmuse> Get the inverted take down. It's one of the most useful skills in the game
[1:41:38] <+nabs2099> Alright I'm back. sorry guys but could anyone tell me what I missed in the last 30 mins?
[1:41:43] <$tallik44123> lobotomy still exist specifically for people like the joker
[1:41:50] <+LeaIsChill> It's his thing LUL
[1:41:52] <%krispen_wa> inverted or critical are worth
[1:41:53] <samuelfisk> Combo takedown
[1:41:54] <+Diamond_Dynamo> In later games, they lay it out more like a tree, which is more intuitive imo
[1:41:55] <CastellanVon> remote control batarang is so dumb but so fun
[1:41:59] <DSD24> Random Bullshit go!
[1:42:01] <+Javatron69> wasnt the mount batmans giant hand?
[1:42:02] <nvst4rk> Batarangs are a good fucking investment tbf
[1:42:04] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @gigamaid but your argument is that killing Joker is bad solely because someone wrote it to be bad for those people who already had such things in them
[1:42:09] <%KeiganOfAstora> @WoolieVersus Inverted Takedown is so good it became a default move in every other game after this one.
[1:42:11] <+nabby1> !motivated
[1:42:11] <@Moobot> 2076 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[1:42:12] <BlackermanZX> Remote control is so fun
[1:42:14] <pi_in_the_sci> remote control batarang is a puzzle solver
[1:42:15] <%Mrthefro> More moves>everything else
[1:42:16] <$ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Inverted takedown is mega useful, too bad you didn't look i guess
[1:42:20] <+GlewmanIII> @tallik44123 personally I don't think we should justify any lobotomy
[1:42:24] <+condemned_15> NECA just put out a replica of the Batman 89 Batarang. Walmart Timed Exclusive
[1:42:26] <%X2Eliah> @WoolieVersus Inverted Takedown is THE BOMB
[1:42:27] <rytisone> no shark repelent :(
[1:42:28] <%runegod20> isn't remote batarang used for some puzzles and stuff?
[1:42:30] <majindusto> IT WAS O EASY TO REMOVE lol
[1:42:30] <user_naim> Inverted Takedown is stealth equivalent of Stinger
[1:42:31] <NeoseekerStitch> health
[1:42:32] <peachy996> It becomes less "Why don't you kill Joker, Batman?" and more "Why don't you just execute Joker, Gotham City?"
[1:42:47] <+Neerb25> Inverted Takedown! Be The Bat!
[1:42:57] <alphalejandro> Spiderman = Web, Batman = Batarangs
[1:42:59] <Asuterisuku> All your attacks are Electrics, basically!
[1:43:01] <elshadow7> 3/237! Nice
[1:43:04] <@Solidus_113> the trophies are just exp
[1:43:04] <PatrickButler299> Isn't remote baterang mandatory in this game tho?
[1:43:08] <SheefEatsBeef> yea no need to sweat on the trophies
[1:43:09] <DaKnightWarrior> Oh no. i'm late!
[1:43:13] <+Story_Ark> Steve?
[1:43:14] <@Commando_Joe> Is the death sentence illegal in whatever state Gotham is in?
[1:43:16] <Zebroneath> it's not super important to get them all
[1:43:17] <fuji_92> a billion of them
[1:43:18] <TheWizardOfWordplay> only do the riddles not the trophies
[1:43:19] <%ZweihanderSteve> oh hi steve blum
[1:43:21] <%HollowedIdjit> It is unbelievable how corrupt Gotham is
[1:43:24] <%spuddnyk> That face has not aged well
[1:43:25] <+johnnychopsocky> you get EXP, Woolie. more punches
[1:43:27] <dinnydanny777> The faces behind those masks look so weird
[1:43:28] <coreybom> @hollowedidjit With Gotham, bruce tries to do as much as can as Both Batman AND Bruce. The city is just fucked. And Batman say kills the joker, whats to stop him from killing the others? They got Bodies too, A LOT of bodies.
[1:43:32] <%Kaito_Cam> it's spike
[1:43:33] <clack14> HollowedIdjit just like the real new york!
[1:43:38] <%SainEdge> getting 100 % is not bad in this game, but in the other games...oh boy
[1:43:38] <%krispen_wa> why doesnt a corrupt cop just kill the joker when he gets in custody
[1:43:41] <FrostedZaibatsu> Youtube exist so collectables are obsolete now
[1:43:41] <DSD24> Hi Steve Blum again!
[1:43:41] <CommanderCOOL> steve blum is everywhere in the batman games
[1:43:47] <amiavamp> @coreybom all I'm hearing is that nuance is too hard
[1:43:47] <+Walopoh> :)
[1:43:48] <Bazal68k> YOU have NEVER PLAYED Arkham Asylum???
[1:43:50] <MonstarGrrrl> silly joker
[1:43:53] <prime_name> No, I was expecting One Face
[1:43:53] <+samuraiknack> Gotham is haunted
[1:43:55] <+discognition> Mark Hamill!
[1:43:57] <alfredfromthedusk> the Steve Blum Everywhere System
[1:43:58] <+Robob00p> @commando_joe I don‚Äôt think but the main problem is they plead insanity
[1:44:00] <+Javatron69> you havent seen death note?!?
[1:44:01] <+Radkon> I always liked the way this game hinted at other big villains without actually showing them
[1:44:02] <+mechslayer71> So is this the original or the remake?
[1:44:05] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Uh oh.
[1:44:09] <%doomerskeletor13> DIRTY COPS
[1:44:11] <%Uncle_Christian> Boles is a rat
[1:44:11] <AncelDeLambert> DETECTIVE MODE STAAAAAAAART!
[1:44:13] <%paladinstarbuster> officer Bawls
[1:44:13] <whiteblacklight74> OFFICER BALLS
[1:44:14] <Halospaz117> OFFICER BALLS
[1:44:15] <puluxor> BALLS
[1:44:17] <deviljhojho_> drinking on the job D:
[1:44:24] <%Th3SmartAlec> Officer Boles and his partner Ligma
[1:44:24] <velgaduere> HOW DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THE INTERNET
[1:44:25] <MidnightSnack69> hamil is so good. joker is a true villain, but hearing hamil do the voice makes me very happy indeed.
[1:44:25] <+Firststrike_OW> D: anything but that!
[1:44:25] <peachy996> Riddler Trophies give more EXP, Actual Riddles give you backstories on other villains/characters
[1:44:26] <penitentpendant> He'd get... SO MANY VIEWS
[1:44:29] <BlackermanZX> Not my Balls D:
[1:44:30] <huskarl_zap> Joker stans elfin lied
[1:44:32] <+Mercening> OFFICER BAAAAAAAAAAWWWWHHHHLLLSSSS
[1:44:33] <Depthcharge2030> No Joker! Not the Internet!
[1:44:37] <NoireRequiem> joker is yandere for batman
[1:44:37] <+even_the_yuenglings> I like how the riddler is a shitposter in the later games
[1:44:39] <radregice> LUL
[1:44:43] <+Undenizen> it IS the booze.
[1:44:43] <$hattrick61> NOOO JOKER, YOU POSTED CRINGE
[1:44:44] <disflipmat> Man Batman's always talking shit about how dumb other people are
[1:44:44] <$Gorotheninja> Bowels is pretty dumb
[1:44:45] <%runegod20> @krispen_wa batman is the type of person where if a cop even considers doing that, he'd paralyses them for life first
[1:44:46] <bear_breaker20> joker uplaods to his myspace page
[1:44:49] <DaKnightWarrior> Sub to Joker.
[1:44:51] <coldfire0007> That place is evil
[1:44:51] <%SentaiGarm> joker's gonna go viral NotLikeThis
[1:44:53] <+Story_Ark> @midnightsnack69 hes the peak joker. he always sounds like hes having a blast recording
[1:44:53] <Manjove> Boles is a smoothbrain confirmed
[1:44:54] <%Mrthefro> Joker would be partnered on Twitch for sure
[1:44:57] <Exodusprime1256> he will post it in the 4chans
[1:44:57] <elshadow7> Oh boy, navigation...
[1:45:01] <theronhal> Batman's face in the remaster looks a little ugly. They gave him a giga chin
[1:45:06] <@Solidus_113> metroiiiiidddddd
[1:45:08] <Asuterisuku> This game is a MetroidVania.
[1:45:10] <+johnnychopsocky> Kevin... Kevin. That line read. No
[1:45:12] <Prevot> "Joker has a heated gamer moment"
[1:45:12] <coreybom> @krispen_wa They tried. But there‚Äôs a reason why Joker has gone toe to toe with Bats.
[1:45:13] <TheWizardOfWordplay> metroidvania
[1:45:14] <+ShutUpAceyP> is reggie or woolie playing?
[1:45:14] <%X2Eliah> Oh yeah this is Metroid as hell
[1:45:15] <brunoberserk> BATROID
[1:45:15] <%sirisvirus> ya this is a metroidvania
[1:45:17] <%KeiganOfAstora> It's a metroid!
[1:45:17] <+Neerb25> I don't think Batman really needs an excuse to not kill Joker. He just doesn't want to kill and that's fine. Nobody has the moral responsibility to be the sole executioner of someone else. Batman already does more to stop Joker than 100% of the rest of Gotham does.
[1:45:19] <%Huttersson> This is a metroidvania.
[1:45:22] <+gustavozxd> "we live in a society" - Joker, actually
[1:45:31] <fuji_92> yeah this batman is metroid as heck
[1:45:32] <mrhappy6677> S e a r c h a c t i o n
[1:45:39] <+YharnamNighthawk> Batvania
[1:45:41] <%Lion_kun> PC PORT IS GREAT GUYS
[1:45:52] <SheefEatsBeef> i'm gonna put my cursor over it so it's like they're holding hands :)
[1:45:53] <user_naim> it‚Äôs a bat cursor
[1:45:59] <+MisterCrimson> I'm actually more surprised the other villains haven't killed Joker yet.
[1:45:59] <%jepupu> Teef are just a bit extra XP
[1:46:01] <%CaptainPileDriver> but he has win before
[1:46:04] <razieltano123> Frank BALLLS.
[1:46:11] <+Radkon> God aren't the teeth needed for 100% completion
[1:46:12] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Fronk.
[1:46:13] <%chosenjuan42> Batman returns fat bat is cool. But Arkham bat is my favorite
[1:46:14] <%Th3SmartAlec> "Please don't use names on comms Oracle"
[1:46:20] <Sparda_blizzard> find the ballz
[1:46:23] <%CateHecate> HE LOOKS JUST LIKE PUNISHER
[1:46:24] <Jaysky> Isn't this guy Lockup?
[1:46:25] <puluxor> "I won't let him" I LOVE that line.
[1:46:30] <%wunp_fxs> LUL
[1:46:32] <raikagelord1> Did I miss the Zsasz already?
[1:46:36] <+Story_Ark> arkham bat is the absolute best. great balance of comic and realistic
[1:46:37] <whiteblacklight74> FRANK BALLS DID IT
[1:46:37] <+MrTurtleThief> LUL
[1:46:40] <NoireRequiem> shout out to kevin conroy
[1:46:41] <%wibbwobbler> LUL
[1:46:43] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Manjove
[1:46:51] <dinnydanny777> It's like the RE6 logo NotLikeThis
[1:46:52] <%krispen_wa> Joker is the worst holdout of 60s batman. he used to be about throwing pies and shit. now he's basically a school shooter that always gets away
[1:46:53] <NewWillinium> I always liked the Bright black bat on yellow. Because that makes it a *target* that people will automatically aim for. So you focus the armor there
[1:46:57] <PainterOfMiniatures> Eh
[1:46:59] <+skyheys> dude what
[1:46:59] <Halospaz117> SON OF A BITCH I SEE IT
[1:47:00] <+nabs2099> WOOLIE HOW DARE U RUIN THAT FOR ME
[1:47:07] <%ThatGuyThere03> Woolie what are you even talking about
[1:47:07] <TheWizardOfWordplay> you can wear that suit in arkham knight
[1:47:07] <clack14> tiddies up top, buts down low.
[1:47:08] <alfredfromthedusk> woolie you've killed me
[1:47:09] <%runegod20> does that gun have 2 barrels without one of them being an undermount thing?
[1:47:10] <Asuterisuku> No my childhood
[1:47:12] <$Gorotheninja> Thanks for the trauma woolie
[1:47:12] <@Solidus_113> Ben Affleck had a bad bat logo
[1:47:13] <disflipmat> wait what are we looking at?
[1:47:13] <+eanscrale> Oh that's why they changed it
[1:47:15] <%paladinstarbuster> two batmans kissing
[1:47:15] <mr_red117> Oh god damnit
[1:47:18] <%KeiganOfAstora> why you do this
[1:47:20] <DovaDude29> hello? The fu k ya talking bout
[1:47:29] <+chiazam> AHHHHHHHHHHHH
[1:47:30] <chll0ne> what are we talking about
[1:47:35] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @krispen_wa because the 60s show made Joker and Riddler popular, Joker did die in the comics
[1:47:38] <%X2Eliah> SIX FEET
[1:47:38] <huskarl_zap> Bruce wayne drive by triple ass slap like Terry bogard
[1:47:39] <ExpressNode> I keep getting these portal 2 updates what are those about?
[1:47:42] <+ShutUpAceyP> 6ft - "not that big"
[1:47:44] <deviljhojho_> relatable content
[1:47:46] <+MisterCrimson> he's an asshole. That's Frank Boles
[1:47:47] <chainsaw105> same Frank
[1:47:48] <OblivionSword1> everyone's 6 ft tall in this game
[1:47:49] <%Mrbaconator> "not that big"
[1:47:51] <razieltano123> Oh hey PAt,
[1:47:51] <velgaduere> "superpowers: dumbass"
[1:47:52] <+FuqBoiSlim> He's just like me

[1:57:00] <ShadowArcangel> Get ready to have that little jingle burned into your brain btw "dun-dun-dun-duuuuuun"
[1:57:03] <+evbites> Gud SHIMMY
[1:57:06] <MAX116030> Oh you didnt watch death note
[1:57:08] <dundore77> @hamahiroyuki hes probably referring to college. most "schools" don't allow sexy halloween outfits
[1:57:10] <+nabs2099> Pat was being ONE GUY
[1:57:10] <+TheTyper> I'd consider it Metroidvania-lite. The game's reaaallyyy guided. Very few areas are optional.
[1:57:20] <NewWillinium> Woolie: "Oh I get it now"
[1:57:21] <+Damie904> Good rule of thumb if you get stuck is use detective mode to point out stuff to grab or climb to.
[1:57:22] <$JamesCorck> Never would I thought I'd see the day, but here we are. I can check that one off the bucket list <3
[1:57:27] <%hazardousmidget> Hold A to run
[1:57:40] <Prevot> it's only this one, really. the others are open world
[1:57:42] <+Diamond_Dynamo> Tbh, other than the level ups, there isn't much Vania in this. It's mostly just Metroid
[1:57:45] <%slandracon> This isn't DMC its Metroid @woolieversus
[1:57:45] <%runegod20> what fuck is that doing there for
[1:57:46] <peachy996> This is Metroidvania-like, the rest are open world
[1:57:46] <datara90> Is Woolie aware on the funny anti pirating this game had ?
[1:57:48] <alphalejandro> Oh this...thing
[1:57:49] <mighty_fine_trousers> Didn't this game have the problem of detective vision being too good?
[1:57:49] <%gnoame> Got that Bat-Trap going
[1:57:51] <prime_name> is it a blue beetle?
[1:57:52] <A_CD_By_Thomas> This shit's so cool.

[1:58:35] <TheWizardOfWordplay> you can exit the menu and still listen to audio tapes

[1:58:36] <%ChoculaUltra> ghosts monkaS
[1:58:38] <+BananaSlammuh> These were neat
[1:58:38] <twoto858> Arkham's a Lovecraftian name, is it not?
[1:58:39] <dukenux> This feels very Lovecraftian(you know, ARKHAM things aside)
[1:58:40] <brachydios777> Lovecraft shit
[1:58:40] <Joestar1890> OH BOY IS IT
[1:58:43] <Shardlab> I think Bruce is distantly related to this guy on his mother's side
[1:58:44] <+evbites> WOOLIE IT'S GOTHAM.
[1:58:49] <PKSomething> I
[1:58:51] <+condemned_15> Did you ever read the Arkham Asylum comic?
[1:58:52] <Halospaz117> AYE
[1:58:54] <+SilverInferno3> Okay so this place is literally cursed???
[1:58:54] <AnneSQF> aaaaye
[1:58:55] <SeruraRenge> @WoolieVersus It's named after Lovecraft, that shouldn't be surprising
[1:58:56] <+johnnychopsocky> Arkham's haunted *loads batarangs*
[1:58:56] <%chosenjuan42> Gotham stuff
[1:59:15] <+Neerb25> Fun fact: in comics the reason Gotham is so awful and spooky is because it's built on ancient cursed bat-god land.
[1:59:21] <%Javaa01> It ties in a little bit, but you can miss it and not lose much
[1:59:23] <+Diamond_Dynamo> Pretty sure the implication is that it's just the writing, not a literal ghost. I could be wrong though
[1:59:23] <%doomerskeletor13> This collectible is inspired by Grant Morrison‚Äôs Arkham Asylum story
[1:59:27] <Manmush> thats dumb
[1:59:29] <Depthcharge2030> Short answer: Ye. Long answer: Yes.
[1:59:30] <Shyguytvch> I've been hoping for this day.
[1:59:31] <+wanzerfaust> Batman punching his way across the room at them.
[1:59:38] <+PikeBot> A+X to throw
[1:59:42] <%AnthroMetal> not dead
[1:59:43] <+MattDemers> That "It's the Bat!" line is probably the main thing I remember from this game most vividly
[1:59:43] <+gustavozxd> @Neerb25 man that is DUMB
[1:59:54] <Asuterisuku> Asylum's Haunted. Anyway throwing is good Crowd Control.
[1:59:55] <+Stormiercashew> where is calendar man
[1:59:56] <theronhal> those recordings were actually pretty fun to collect since I found them really interesting
[2:00:00] <hamahiroyuki> ye souls rolling
[2:00:00] <dinnydanny777> Don't think about how they aren't moving when the fights end LUL
[2:00:03] <%hazardousmidget> I love the sound design during the fights, every punch sounds so goo
[2:00:08] <anAngryHamster> Why is Woolie button bashing?
[2:00:11] <huskarl_zap> Miskatonic uni
[2:00:12] <+Mercening> They're knocked out cold.
[2:00:12] <%megaman_sentinel> Batman doesn't kill lol
[2:00:13] <penitentpendant> This game is very punishing for 'whiffs', you can pause a bit to line up your next hit but swinging at empty air instantly drops a combo
[2:00:16] <SixthShinx> Amadeus Amadeus
[2:00:17] <+Javatron69> are we going to show woolie the arkham city easter egg when he gets there
[2:00:26] <%LoVezineTheAir> let him play the game
[2:00:26] <%X2Eliah> @anAngryHamster Because he is a pro fighting game player
[2:00:27] <%Mrthefro> The more shit you throw into your combo the more xp you get woolieGASM
[2:00:27] <elshadow7> Can you do the slide into the vents in this one? Or was that later on?
[2:00:30] <+evbites> Gotham city just sucks so much that anything in it sucks
[2:00:35] <dukenux> Half-Life vents
[2:00:37] <@Solidus_113> monkaS guns
[2:00:38] <user_naim> @javatron69 i mean let‚Äôs not scream about it
[2:00:39] <Jaysky> Jump if you don't see a combo ready it extends it
[2:00:43] <SeruraRenge> also the city in Demonbane is Arkham
[2:00:43] <%runegod20> "Asylum's haunt? *loads batarang* "Asylum's haunted."
[2:00:48] <andre11dr> Ghosts are not even that weird in this universe
[2:00:55] <%Stupid121v2> Gotham itself is basically a stand that makes stupid shit just happen
[2:01:00] <brachydios777> In Earth 2 I think Martha Wayne was a Arkham
[2:01:01] <Treyu000> why put a gargoyle there?
[2:01:07] <+chiazam> STEALTH
[2:01:08] <datara90> the forbidden gargoyle

[2:01:24] <mudamudajo> Sleepy time
[2:01:34] <+Story_Ark> If you think thats weird, batman was once "killed" by darkseid but instead sent through time where he became a caveman, a pirate, and others
[2:01:34] <MidnightSnack69> will you be seated in red skeleton or blue skeletons
[2:01:35] <Asuterisuku> Tutorial moment.

[2:01:43] <+skyheys> lmao tutorials
[2:01:49] <theronhal> Earth 1 was such a good read
[2:01:50] <seniormeatbox> You absolutely can take these guys head-on if you're fast enough

[2:02:07] <Halospaz117> SNIFF THE BAT PITS
[2:02:07] <%X2Eliah> THIS IS THE GAME. SILENT STEALTH TAKEDOWNS ON EVERYTHING.
[2:02:10] <+evbites> Knockout SMASH
[2:02:10] <+Diamond_Dynamo> There's also a bunch of room noise obscuring it
[2:02:12] <%bearwagon> time for skeleton mode
[2:02:16] <Murdercles> genome soldiers???
[2:02:25] <%runegod20> at least it's more silent than the takedowns in deus ex

[2:02:42] <alfredfromthedusk> Yeah tbf punching is not actually that loud in the real world, it's quieter than a slap and they have to make the sound bigger by hitting sides of beef
[2:03:00] <dukenux> Joker is the shittiest boss ever
[2:03:01] <TreeLeafBoi> My when Batman turns my skeleton blue
[2:03:03] <+chiazam> JOKER SEES THIS
[2:03:04] <$QueequegTheater> Hi Luke
[2:03:04] <DumbNerdThing> really fun to wait and listen to the thugs' conversations before you take them down
[2:03:04] <+NumiiPlays> wow its happening and we are here to see it. time to let them see the jankiest jank. lol
[2:03:07] <SeruraRenge> Gotham only makes sense in a setting where Metropolis and Central City don't exist because it really raises the question of how the league lets it and Bludhaven stay that way
[2:03:09] <%Infernal_Dalek> Batman SUS
[2:03:14] <+NocturnePsycho> joker is just here for fun
[2:03:14] <+ShutUpAceyP> BATMAN vs SKELTONS!
[2:03:16] <Arancet> theyre your loading screens
[2:03:18] <NoireRequiem> JO
[2:03:20] <huskarl_zap> CHAOS. IS FAIR
[2:03:22] <velgaduere> y can't Batman morph ball??
[2:03:23] <LVL1_Scumbag> The most ludicrously oversized vents
[2:03:24] <Indigo_Automaton> Video Game Vents
[2:03:24] <$BallerSwagBro9k> AMOOGUS
[2:03:28] <+taggerung403> vent maintenance must earn a ton
[2:03:32] <seniormeatbox> HOLY SHIT THEY ARE
[2:03:32] <%hazardousmidget> I LOVE hamill in this game holy crap he sounds almost better tha he did in TAS.
[2:03:41] <+skyheys> BIDEOGAME ass video game
[2:03:44] <%slandracon> This is a nice 1-2 night completeion game if everything goes smoothly
[2:03:45] <marvel877> They can't hear you with the vents, Woolie.
[2:03:47] <+wanzerfaust> Imagine Metroid, but Samus just crawls around real fast instead of morph ball.
[2:03:47] <brian_peppers1> Mark Hamill is sooooo goood
[2:03:50] <deviljhojho_> stealthy bat
[2:03:52] <thetrashman_sc> hey its this room
[2:03:59] <amiavamp> Here goes MGS 5 mode
[2:04:00] <twoto858> First combat room, let's see how woolie does
[2:04:02] <T_Sasquatch> @delgm woolie is playing LUL its not going to be
[2:04:03] <+Story_Ark> god i fuckin LOVE hamill. im so upset that movie joker is always gonna be the edgy dark joker
[2:04:10] <+mechslayer71> Oh yeah, the demo room
[2:04:11] <+Diamond_Dynamo> Imo, these games are Mark's best Joker performance
[2:04:11] <+gustavozxd> arkham games have a LOT of dialogue that most players won't hear most of them
[2:04:14] <peachy996> Yeah yeah yeah get into the Stealth.
[2:04:15] <dundore77> silently kick open a metal grate thats screwed into the wall
[2:04:24] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> you can do it twitch, load the video
[2:04:24] <%krispen_wa> THE REAL GAME STARTS NOW
[2:04:27] <+samuraiknack> Batman Beyond Return of the Joker is peak Hamill
[2:04:27] <Asuterisuku> Welcome to your first Predator encounter.
[2:04:31] <rytisone> gargoyles are your best friends
[2:04:33] <jorniev> this is why i love the batman gaqmes
[2:04:37] <+condemned_15> He COMIN
[2:04:42] <dukenux> Yeah, Hammill definitely brought his A game here
[2:04:43] <anAngryHamster> This room was mind-blowing in the demo
[2:04:44] <coreybom> @serurarenge In fairness, where do think a lot of the criminals decide to go? The reason why the crime in somewhere like metropolis is more white collar and alien is because what dumbass is going rob a bank with supes around?
[2:04:45] <+evbites> The next level action joker needs to be the goofiest guy ever still murdery but actually funny
[2:04:46] <Halospaz117> Glide kicks are loud
[2:04:48] <TheWizardOfWordplay> ground pounds are loud
[2:04:51] <BlackermanZX> bodied
[2:04:51] <$QueequegTheater> He's fiiiine
[2:04:51] <%wibbwobbler> yes
[2:04:52] <+moink1234> just kneed his dick
[2:04:55] <@akuda_bar> do you think joker actually believes these guys will kill batman, or is them trying just part of the joke
[2:04:56] <%Infernal_Dalek> A non-stylin' takedown
[2:05:00] <%KeiganOfAstora> You can drop behind him and do a silent takedown
[2:05:01] <+CptBritches> Non-stylin takedown
[2:05:05] <%bearwagon> extweme?
[2:05:05] <Darren716> Certain knock outs will cause enemies to investigate
[2:05:06] <brachydios777> These are great
[2:05:08] <%Stupid121v2> If you pirate the game, doesn't it remove the Gargoyles and make this room unwinnable?
[2:05:13] <FrostedZaibatsu> I think one of the first videos i posted on youtube was just Batman t-baggin an enemy. LUL
[2:05:14] <%Th3SmartAlec> ...Failed the interview. Immediately.
[2:05:16] <$BallerSwagBro9k> YEYEYEY INTERVIEWS
[2:05:18] <penitentpendant> And it was at this point it's as much fault the hiring process as hers
[2:05:19] <%kewlmyc> That's a red flag right there
[2:05:24] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> She was the best interview all day
[2:05:27] <%ShinobiPhoenix> see? NOT VERY BRIGHT
[2:05:28] <+taggerung403> playing the combat in detective mode only is a classic
[2:05:29] <seniormeatbox> big RED flaaag
[2:05:33] <A_CD_By_Thomas> These are pretty cool too. I don't really like that this version of Quinzel had the accent before she became Quinn.
[2:05:34] <+chiazam> She's always sounded like this
[2:05:34] <RyuuAoi> This is before she was psycho
[2:05:36] <DaKnightWarrior> The interviews are so good!
[2:05:38] <Calamity2007> Yay animated series reference
[2:05:38] <SixthShinx> Not sure how I feel about Harleen being somewhat off before meeting Joker
[2:05:44] <Prevot> that's her accent woolie
[2:05:44] <+Neerb25> Arkham probably doesn't have a whole lot of applicants tbf
[2:05:44] <%BusterRepukken> D A M A G E D
[2:05:45] <+Weeewer> she seems starry-eye'd
[2:05:46] <$Gorotheninja> These are lines from the show
[2:05:46] <+FuqBoiSlim> Those interviewers really didnt give a fuck huh
[2:05:47] <%runegod20> yeah, I like her being a completely normal person before meeting joker, like TAS
[2:05:48] <alphalejandro> She was a loser
[2:05:50] <$ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> She's allowed to have an accent
[2:05:55] <%Javaa01> Yeah this is just a case of botched VA direction
[2:05:58] <TallPixels> same voice actor though so i wonder why they did that
[2:06:00] <%chosenjuan42> It just her voice
[2:06:04] <+nightwing1936> Woolie Remembers right
[2:06:04] <%krispen_wa> This copies the dialogue right from the BTAS episode, but she didnt have the accent there
[2:06:05] <andre11dr> No it's dumb when she's professional
[2:06:06] <velgaduere> her origin has had slightly different takes over time
[2:06:07] <user_naim> Man this Asylum sucks.
[2:06:12] <cheap_turbo> that was just her boston accent
[2:06:13] <pi_in_the_sci> she's just from brooklyn
[2:06:13] <Shardlab> The accent was a put-on in the beginning. Then they just made that her actual accent
[2:06:13] <+skyheys> yeah, tara did a mediocre job
[2:06:13] <exnuart> she's from queens
[2:06:15] <dekkitout> "It was a very small subpoena"
[2:06:18] <+Javatron69> i like how in the later games they made it apparent that everyone has a hard jersey accent
[2:06:20] <jorniev> thats just the accent woolie
[2:06:22] <%eyezehuhh> probably different voice direction
[2:06:22] <dinnydanny777> Listen, not everyone wants to work at the asylum for the criminally insane, they can't be too choosy LUL
[2:06:22] <+Story_Ark> note: for the ground takedown, you dont have to press both at the same time. you just have to crouch and press y while crouched.
[2:06:26] <+evbites> @Stupid121v2 it removes the cape glide entirely
[2:06:26] <Asuterisuku> Round Two!
[2:06:27] <Halospaz117> Yeah, the lines are directly from the show, but her voice was more normal in the show
[2:06:29] <%Deepfriedhamster> Did you know Batman means Japanese sword
[2:06:29] <prime_name> @user_naim Most mental health facilities in media do
[2:06:42] <zedravan> most of them do
[2:06:46] <+Diamond_Dynamo> I remember I read a comic called Harleen a while ago, that just deals with her becoming the villain we know today
[2:06:48] <%slandracon> Every villain has great interviews
[2:06:49] <Komayeda> INVERTED TAKEDOWN

[2:07:00] <peachy996> You can meet that same female doctor in the Zsasz room, but you missed her. No biggie

[2:07:03] <+ShutUpAceyP> please get the inverted takedown
[2:07:04] <Indigo_Automaton> Invereted Takedown will help!
[2:07:05] <binaryanomaly16> INVERTED TAKEDOWN, WOOLZ
[2:07:07] <Frodiddly> @skyheys IIRC, this was the one game that had the TAS VA
[2:07:07] <NoireRequiem> Idk there are some takes that she kissed her way through her degree
[2:07:07] <brunoberserk> inverter takedown is awesome
[2:07:08] <amiavamp> When you glide kick they can feel the menacing aura radiating from you
[2:07:11] <LVL1_Scumbag> Crits are good
[2:07:12] <$QueequegTheater> Inverted Takedown
[2:07:12] <+Superbro64> shhhh. chat
[2:07:13] <ralphfromdk> Fighting is not for rooms with guns. Guns mean stealth
[2:07:16] <jamsbybetty> maybe that recording is her getting hired to be a nurse to be an insider for Joker
[2:07:18] <+ScottishMadJacko> Stop bacmseating
[2:07:19] <+Deekman> Every time he fails to kill the Joker the blood of his next thousand victims is on his hands

[2:07:21] <PWNMAKER> Inverted takedown time Woolz
[2:07:28] <+JacknZack27> I love the inverted takedown
[2:07:31] <DSD24> Wow Bats looked intense there
[2:07:33] <Doctadaking> Inverted Takedown is so good that it became part of the default move list in the sequels
[2:07:34] <+chiazam> Inverted Takedown
[2:07:35] <puluxor> That art is savage asakuraYer
[2:07:36] <feralspidey> Damnit, I missed the first two hours! Woolie, you're gonna get into the combat in this game. It is literally "Do Combo" the Batman Game.
[2:07:37] <alphalejandro> Baman was like ARRRRGH
[2:07:38] <brian_peppers1> so dont mash
[2:07:42] <%runegod20> the critical combo thing is the exact same blue hit thing you had in spiderman ps4
[2:07:44] <%dreadedcthulhu> he'll get it when he decides to get it

[2:08:04] <%ShinobiPhoenix> "I don't need you to be scared. I need you to be quiet."
[2:08:09] <%Mrthefro> Incentive to not mash SeemsGood
[2:08:10] <%LCLSmoothie> "im not scared of you batman" - man scared of batman
[2:08:12] <rytisone> glide kick is loud
[2:08:15] <Asuterisuku> Don't Mash, the Mechanic.
[2:08:27] <+Dova573> man I love making this people scared

[2:08:33] <jorniev> man i kinda wanna play asylum again
[2:08:33] <whiteblacklight74> not lethal btw
[2:08:33] <%slandracon> Stealth is 60% easier with invert takedown

[2:27:13] <amiavamp> @MrGuy516 TBF this is one of the better looking games of this generation
[2:27:16] <+FuzzyGuru> I mean, this game still aged remarkably well considering it's 12 years old. I know some people that have aged worse than this game in 12 years.
[2:27:22] <$emptyantics> Woolie becomes DSP with maps

[2:29:11] <+primax104> batman had to walk so that spidey could swing

[2:29:13] <$Kaiser_Loar> was that Nolen North
[2:29:15] <jaygee303> One thing I‚Äôll say is that you really see the improvement in graphics of the Two generations in the 3 games
[2:29:15] <anAngryHamster> Not 2nd Lt. Chavez!
[2:29:20] <+Javatron69> yes
[2:29:21] <$emptyantics> Wait till they see the glowup in Arkham Knight
[2:29:22] <feralspidey> It is an older title.

[2:29:55] <rytisone> shhhhhhhh
[2:29:57] <mexicansunglasses> Graphics ain't everything. In fact they're nothing. Knight is the prettiest but it's also the worst written Batmobile game ever made.

[2:30:34] <centuronstar> Oh yeah the first game in particular. Detective mode is always on.
[2:30:34] <Asuterisuku> Most people who play the game don't even realize the characters have textures.
[2:30:37] <%BusterRepukken> why people so mad in chat
[2:30:39] <+JacknZack27> I always had to force my self to use detective mode less
[2:30:39] <%bread_assassin> Why would there be a seesaw in a prison anyways?
[2:30:40] <NoireRequiem> mega mind!
[2:30:40] <+Walopoh> See-Saw at an Insane Asylum LUL
[2:30:45] <+Diamond_Dynamo> Yeah, that's the mood, especially in this game. They try to deal with it in later entries, but they never totally succeed imo
[2:30:45] <AvroEltz> Woolie, they are not armed, just beat em up
[2:30:49] <@akuda_bar> @majindusto is just video game

[2:32:21] <%jonblnt> love how batman looks at his gadgets. like it's the first time for him
[2:32:21] <+TheotherKristian> The explosive whip cream

[2:35:00] <FrostedZaibatsu> you can stand by the explosion
[2:35:01] <jamesthebrave> I know a guy who used to do that before taking interviews actually lmaooooooo
[2:35:07] <whiteblacklight74> it's unlocked, but you still need the point
[2:35:10] <BlackermanZX> Gel is really good. That and Remote Batarang
[2:35:18] <%Uncle_Christian> incapacitates

[2:35:30] <%Th3SmartAlec> We doing this LUL
[2:35:30] <SixthShinx> Tobacco ID: WILD COUNTRY
[2:35:31] <DrkJP520> There are a lot of riddles
[2:35:37] <+PikeBot> The Tweedle-Dum one is harrrrd
[2:35:38] <Komayeda> Some are hidden behind things you can't get to at this moment
[2:35:39] <brunoberserk> do it if you want
[2:35:39] <+Undenizen> the riddler trophies are VERY not worth it.
[2:35:40] <Darren716> Woolie you'll be revisiting these areas a lot, you'll have the time
[2:35:40] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> The Riddler stuff in this game is manageable compared to the later games, DO THEM
[2:35:41] <user_naim> Do it later
[2:35:43] <%doomerskeletor13> The jingle is so good
[2:35:44] <fuji_92> 100% optional just so u know
[2:35:46] <+Damie904> I dont think anyone will care if you just use a guide for some of these.
[2:35:49] <Asuterisuku> The brain goblins have been planted.
[2:35:49] <Indigo_Automaton> Sandbag the Riddler. He HATES it
[2:35:49] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I believe it was on the ground behind where they are
[2:35:50] <AvroEltz> Try it, but dont spend so much on it
[2:35:51] <TheWizardOfWordplay> give it the clown college try
[2:35:52] <+nabs2099> Woolie u can safely ignore the riddler stuff cos it doesn't get good until Arkham city
[2:35:52] <majindusto> This LP is totally gonna be Woolie interrupting Dialog constantly...Isn't it?
[2:35:53] <EcchiMichael> Don't worry about it
[2:35:53] <ralphfromdk> Don't feel to bad about the big open areas, you will come back to them again and again.
[2:35:55] <+thewellroundedgamer99> I don‚Äôt have to
[2:35:56] <samuelfisk> Some of the riddles are cool. Others are not.
[2:35:56] <+CptBritches> You can't do em all or this playthrough will never end lol
[2:35:57] <snakest3alth> You can solve them postgame
[2:35:59] <brachydios777> It‚Äôs not worth it
[2:35:59] <+JacknZack27> Its up to you. I find them fun, but if you dont its okay
[2:36:00] <%runegod20> can't blame anyone using a guide if they get too stuck on them
[2:36:00] <+Zeroblazex> It‚Äôs a Metroidvania, sometimes you‚Äôll have to come back
[2:36:01] <thetrashman_sc> ITS RIGHT THEREs
[2:36:02] <CoffeeSlice> mind goblins LUL
[2:36:03] <+discognition> 2 o clock
[2:36:04] <%Stupid121v2> I still hear that chime in my head sometimes and I Haven't played this since 2012
[2:36:04] <LunarRemix> You can just do it off-stream looking up a guide
[2:36:04] <+condemned_15> you're not gonna find shit at that vantage point
[2:36:08] <$QueequegTheater> You should do them all even if you have to do them off stream
[2:36:10] <+CloudsBringRain> AHHHHH. IT WAS RIGHT THERE
[2:36:13] <+TheotherKristian> Is Arkham a Metroid-Prime Like?
[2:36:16] <+mister___doctor> How many times has the Death Note joke been made
[2:36:17] <%patriotrenegade> sounds like Mergo's Lullaby
[2:36:17] <feralspidey> Don't Ever Sweat It.
[2:36:21] <%Javaa01> It was directly across from the railing and at the end of the area
[2:36:24] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Don't sweat the shiny in the tower
[2:36:24] <peachy996> You can save these Riddles for later if you want. Like close to the Final Game Later
[2:36:28] <@Solidus_113> Joker is watching his anime waiting for you
[2:36:28] <%jonblnt> @majindusto isn't that all of his LPs

[2:36:59] <+TheTyper> Is this a special edition of the game? The music seems more constant than in others.
[2:37:00] <+k0alapants> How many times did they not see the giant seesaw
[2:37:05] <BlackermanZX> I bet Joker is a fan of redo of healer of some shit
[2:37:07] <+taggerung403> dedicated to the craft
[2:37:10] <rytisone> he's a dedicated builder

[2:38:10] <clack14> Docblargle everyone is a skeleton. All skeletons do crime. Thus you're correct.
[2:38:12] <+CptBritches> monkaS
[2:38:15] <@akuda_bar> imagine just staring at a dudes skeleton
[2:38:15] <+ManimalCrackerss> batman doesnt SEE color
[2:38:16] <Indigo_Automaton> All Skeletons Are Criminals
[2:38:18] <%Stupid121v2> joker shut UP
[2:38:31] <%patriotrenegade> Medical, huh. I'm gonna guess Croc is in charge there.
[2:38:40] <+Story_Ark> nah joker keep talking.
[2:38:46] <SoaringTrumpet> such an iconic laugh
[2:38:48] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @patriotrenegade actually no
[2:38:50] <FrostedZaibatsu> @Stupid121v2 New to Batman huh
[2:38:54] <+Walopoh> "Sorry, sir you have a skeleton like the rest of them"
[2:38:58] <footdive_> This game aged well
[2:38:59] <masterfire23> he's dead
[2:39:12] <T_Sasquatch> this combat changed video games forever
[2:39:13] <@akuda_bar> @Walopoh noooooooooooooo
[2:39:17] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Learning to counter in this game keeps the combo flowing
[2:39:20] <+TheTyper> I do love how this game's higher difficulties punish you for mashing
[2:39:22] <+memes_are_cancer> MY SPINE
[2:39:23] <BlackermanZX> good ol' Bat-crippling
[2:39:24] <brian_peppers1> ITS GOOD THO
[2:39:28] <dinnydanny777> Thrown five feet, onto his back, onto a concrete floor huh, yeah he's fine Kappa
[2:39:29] <%spuddnyk> It looks so jank now but this was awesome
[2:39:30] <peachy996> It's simple but it's so fun and silly
[2:39:30] <johnnydalmann> I love awkward slo-mos
[2:39:34] <KgKid51> I love it LUL
[2:39:35] <%bread_assassin> So who would be the best Batman villain to be a henchmen for.
[2:39:37] <Doctadaking> The enemy rag dolls are hilarious
[2:39:38] <Halospaz117> Its goof but good goof
[2:39:43] <%Exiliator> Pow! Zap! Bam!
[2:39:46] <fuji_92> it's the type of good goofy tho
[2:39:48] <zachattak01> is good jank
[2:39:48] <ralphfromdk> Eh... it's kinda to show how much of a beast that Batman is. He jumps around like... a superhero
[2:39:49] <%doomerskeletor13> @bread_assassin Kite Man
[2:39:50] <+evbites> @bread_assassin penguin
[2:39:51] <%HitchhikingThrough> Not a lot of difference between joker and a fromsoftware npc
[2:39:52] <+NocturnePsycho> they double down on the absurdity in future combat
[2:39:53] <+samuraiknack> Mr Freeze
[2:39:53] <$emptyantics> We can all agree that Dr. Friez is the best boss fight out all games right?
[2:39:55] <RyuuAoi> Batman ain't gonna kill you but he gonna bust some skulls
[2:40:05] <%krispen_wa> so what does PhysX actually do if it doesnt control ragdolls?
[2:40:15] <samuelfisk> Emptyantics absolutely
[2:40:20] <thetrashman_sc> monkaS
[2:40:21] <deviljhojho_> me? :)
[2:40:23] <+mechslayer71> @emptyantics in City? Yeah it‚Äôs pretty good
[2:40:24] <reonome> ME?
[2:40:24] <%Th3SmartAlec> me?
[2:40:24] <TheCrispyBoi> me?
[2:40:24] <RoboticRexkek> cloths I think
[2:40:26] <+MisterCrimson> @bread_assassin there was a comic about just that and the consensus was Riddler since he offers insurance and doesn't wantonly kill his henchmen.
[2:40:27] <@Solidus_113> smoke effects, papers, etc
[2:40:29] <brachydios777> Me?
[2:40:31] <dukenux> :) ?
[2:40:32] <UvBenServed> Sup
[2:40:32] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @WoolieVersus whiffing and attacking the air or missing a counter makes you drop the combo too
[2:40:32] <+PikeBot> @krispen_wa it adds more moving stuff in the environment like fallen papers, leaves etc
[2:40:32] <%Javaa01> @krispen_wa Cloth physics, smoke particles, broken glass, tertiary things like that
[2:40:33] <Asuterisuku> @krispen_wa Lots of the little extra bits; fog, foliage, loose documents.
[2:40:34] <%patriotrenegade> ME?
[2:40:36] <anothernub> DAMN
[2:40:36] <%runegod20> @bread_assassin There was a conversation in the comics about that, I think the goons came to the conclusion that the Penguin is the best since he won't randomly kill you like the joker, or as a 50/50 with 2 face
[2:40:36] <seniormeatbox> DAMN

[2:44:33] <mudapersona> Dude joker fuccs in the comics
[2:44:35] <@Commando_Joe> @dukenux Gotham City's government is so corrupt that Bruce's tax dollars probably go to the mafia
[2:44:36] <$QueequegTheater> Joker needs that batdick
[2:44:37] <+Walopoh> Bruce Wayne's 1% genes cause his eye to twitch when he hears $15/hour wage
[2:44:42] <FrostedZaibatsu> How does a person with a hairline receding that much get one like Harley
[2:44:42] <brachydios777> @nabs2099 Too late
[2:44:50] <Asuterisuku> Can you see Wayne Tower from here?
[2:44:51] <whiteblacklight74> harley had a massive plot barrier right there in front of you powered by concentrated PLOT
[2:44:51] <penitentpendant> "Batman's shown up? Is it Tuesday already?"
[2:44:59] <+samuraiknack> Yeah you can see him doing the mocap in the behind the scene video
[2:45:11] <+Undenizen> it's a GREAT movie.

[2:45:18] <+Superbro64> we all know bruce wayne donates to gotham boys' orphanage for the tax breaks Kappa
[2:45:18] <johnnydalmann> mother. You're alive?
[2:45:19] <dinnydanny777> Do you think if you kissed Joker his skin and his lips would just be flaking off?
[2:45:21] <ralphfromdk> No Woolie... no one can figure that one out LUL
[2:45:24] <deviljhojho_> ladies love the widow peak. look at vegeta

[2:45:32] <Torgue_1> @nekodelic New York, I think
[2:45:33] <derap41> gonna be honest I hate detective mode
[2:45:33] <+MisterCrimson> @nekodelic Boston
[2:45:35] <mudamudajo> Every guard corpse you encounter should be followed by saying out loud "15 dollars"
[2:45:37] <+chiazam> NO ONSCREEN Gordon for you
[2:45:41] <mr_sups> There, used to be a greying tower Alone on the sea!

[2:46:06] <AvroEltz> Hes loving it
[2:46:06] <%Th3SmartAlec> Good old Mark
[2:46:08] <%DakotaMacDoodle> The books are fantastic
[2:46:11] <mortalmanbaby> he is super good in thins
[2:46:11] <+evbites> why can't we get this in live action?
[2:46:11] <dukenux> "Annihilation" is a good sci-fi movie that no one watched. @WoolieVersus can you say which tv show, without spoiling too much?
[2:46:12] <therealtacopancakes> give us the tv series woolz, wanna get in on that
[2:46:14] <%Stupid121v2> Mark KILLS it this game, and he KEEPS getting new lines as the game goes on. fuckin perfect
[2:46:16] <%X2Eliah> Woolie.....
[2:46:17] <andre11dr> Mark loves this shit
[2:46:17] <+Walopoh> SO. MANY. LINES.
[2:46:18] <+CptBritches> The bear screaming in Annihilation is one of the most disturbing things I've seen in a film
[2:46:19] <mr_red117> Mark gives it his all
[2:46:20] <rytisone> It really paid off to hire Mark
[2:46:27] <Halospaz117> Batman's got t-rex arms
[2:46:27] <%slandracon> BTw you can spray on any wall or floor @WoolieVersus
[2:46:28] <RaidenRising> he loves it
[2:46:29] <%Javaa01> If you like Mark, then this is the trilogy for you, cause boy is there a lot of Mark here, and he's just going all out
[2:46:31] <+Reverend_Roscoe> Mark putting the HAM in Hamill
[2:46:35] <Doctadaking> I think the Joker lines are starting to repeat now
[2:46:40] <Ashenik1> Marvel bias at it again Kappa
[2:46:40] <Lancaster_H> kevin conroy and mark hamill are my favourite power couple
[2:46:43] <$Gorotheninja> Shut up Joker, you're not as cool as PROMETHEUS
[2:46:43] <brunoberserk> i mean , if you have mark , YOU GONNA USE MARK
[2:46:44] <centuronstar> Please tell me someone clipped that $15 Bucks an hour part
[2:46:45] <brachydios777> Wandavision is so good!
[2:46:46] <+AkronymCLT> Groucho Mark over here
[2:46:50] <+nabs2099> What so MCU STAY WINNING? AGAIN?
[2:46:53] <BaslerJones> this game is so odd
[2:47:00] <majindusto> MARVEL BIAS
[2:47:01] <@Solidus_113> no talking about MCU
[2:47:02] <dinnydanny777> Imagine literally dying to a super dangerous criminal at work for $15 an hour, damn
[2:47:14] <+MisterCrimson> wasn't annihilation that movie that was just Strange Journey?
[2:47:15] <peachy996> This game wants you to look around the area
[2:47:21] <+Undenizen> I mean, have you ever seen STALKER? Not the game, the movie. Old ass russian film. arthouse as fuck. Annihilation was going for that.
[2:47:22] <LunarRemix> When does this take place?
[2:47:24] <RyuuAoi> The MCU is dead
[2:47:24] <+samuraiknack> Finally a repeated Joker line
[2:47:25] <+Diamond_Dynamo> Do you think Arkham guards get 39.5 hours a week, too?
[2:47:26] <derap41> Should stil be 22
[2:47:32] <%ShinobiPhoenix> what is Canadian Minimum Wage?
[2:47:32] <Wild_Samurai> Imagine living in a world where Lazarus Pits exist and dying at all
[2:47:33] <ralphfromdk> But... didn't he say 50? LUL
[2:47:38] <Tooniearcade> Loll
[2:47:42] <DatAsuna> In 2007 that was fairly good
[2:47:42] <+mechslayer71> @ralphfromdk nope
[2:47:45] <penitentpendant> Bonus points if it's only 39 hours a week
[2:47:48] <$QueequegTheater> @ralphfromdk no
[2:47:48] <dork_doggler> @lunarremix eighties
[2:47:48] <fuji_92> he said 15 100%
[2:47:56] <Blank9> They get the same health care the Arkham inmates get.
[2:47:58] <+Walopoh> I also want to shout out Kevin Conroy as the PERFECT Batman voice. I can't imagine any other
[2:47:58] <exnuart> $15 is minimum security lol
[2:47:59] <+ClericOfSparda> Why do you think that guy betrayed the Asylum for Joker? he probably paid better
[2:47:59] <Decimated_body> AMOGUS
[2:47:59] <Dao_Puppy> What's the Min in Canada right now?
[2:48:01] <%Stupid121v2> He said $15 fo sho
[2:48:01] <mudamudajo> Every guard corpse (15 dollars)
[2:48:01] <Asuterisuku> That wage point is bullshit blazing.
[2:48:08] <$ParatrooperDylan> Fun fact
[2:48:08] <%patriotrenegade> What benfits do Arkham guards get? Are they part of a union?
[2:48:08] <dukenux> @MisterCrimson it was more like "Color out of Space"
[2:48:13] <Joestar1890> According to inflation it would be $25 now....but you know damn well Sharp would keep the pay at 15.
[2:48:13] <+Superbro64> good comedy truly transcends time itself, huh
[2:48:13] <CastellanVon> He rips that grate off so swole like
[2:48:18] <+evbites> @ClericOfSparda 1000 dollers a day
[2:48:23] <andre11dr> Well, how much do the Riker's guards get?
[2:48:28] <user_naim> Can you slide through wents in this game like you can in City chat?
[2:48:29] <FrostedZaibatsu> $15 is still not enough for today in reality
[2:48:31] <Forkeye> all that money and no generosity
[2:48:46] <Darren716> I mean it's $15 for an hour for a job that likely doesn't require any advance education. Like they let that drunk be a guard so they'll anyone
[2:48:47] <dinnydanny777> I've seen the one where the people clean old buildings that they can't put scaffolding on and fuck that
[2:48:52] <Visorak6> ITS JUST NOT IN THE BUDGET
[2:48:53] <+Javatron69> @user_naim that's only in city and beyond I believe
[2:48:56] <brachydios777> Thanks billionaire Bruce Wayne
[2:48:57] <%runegod20> truckers who drive through ice and stuff and people on fishing boats make way more money than that
[2:48:58] <+AnIrishPapaya> Hmmm Arkham Super Villain Island Security Guard or Customer Service Associate at Home Depot. hmmmmm
[2:48:58] <AvroEltz> And they have A LOT of guards, dont know how
[2:48:58] <%baka_sugoi> LUL
[2:48:58] <%Uncle_Christian> Arkham has a Temp agency
[2:49:02] <LunarRemix> Oh then it's actually alot. That's legit good pay in the '80s
[2:49:05] <ExpressNode> Running a gambit
[2:49:08] <Depthcharge2030> people have literally lost their hands to Killer Croc working at arkham
[2:49:09] <Ashenik1> WEEKENDS?!?
[2:49:09] <Halospaz117> WHAT IS THIS HANDOUT BULLSHIT
[2:49:17] <anothernub> Bruce Wayne could single handedly solve the crime problem in Gotham by just giving everyone on the city an universal basic income of 15$/h out of his own pocket.
[2:49:18] <RyuuAoi> Prices going up. The dollars down.
[2:49:22] <deviljhojho_> stealthy bat
[2:49:23] <DatAsuna> @FrostedZaibatsu I mean they were saying $15 was needed 5 years ago, and inflation doesn't wait for you to catch up, yeah.
[2:49:24] <%psidefx> HOLIDAYS OFF?!?
[2:49:32] <@akuda_bar> why are there gargoyles in a warehouse
[2:49:33] <+Robob00p> You would use those ten days for when joker is in
[2:49:37] <skullnaught> lmao what?
[2:49:38] <$QueequegTheater> sure
[2:49:39] <+RowenCleric> we all have to be flexible and make some adjustments here

[2:49:39] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[2:49:41] <%bearwagon> LUL
[2:49:43] <%jinking79> yes 2% inmates keeps breaking out

[2:49:44] <alphalejandro> Dental care?
[2:49:45] <asleepyknight> every time the someone escapes everyones pay is reduced to pay for damages
[2:49:45] <peachy996> We take those
[2:49:49] <Asuterisuku> Well done.
[2:49:49] <marvel877> Still no inverted takedown?
[2:49:50] <$emptyantics> ‚ÄúHEALTH INSURANCE?! With talk like that you belong in one of these cells!‚Äù

[2:49:53] <Doctadaking> Blow up those walls
[2:49:57] <keankong85> there is a move you can learn that is useful here

[2:50:10] <+nabs2099> @anothernub Now hold on! if writers acknowledged that then society would never accept it! we NEED the status quo, no self thinking!
[2:50:11] <+chiazam> Man Inverted Takedown woulda been perfect there
[2:50:13] <%Javaa01> You can detonate it remotely
[2:50:15] <%patriotrenegade> DO IT
[2:50:17] <johnnydalmann> similar music to batman begins theme
[2:50:21] <user_naim> do it
[2:50:21] <Tooniearcade> Do it
[2:50:21] <$ParatrooperDylan> Fun fact: Gotham City is canonically in New Jersey, which probably explains why it sucks so much
[2:50:34] <@akuda_bar> everything's legal in jersey
[2:50:38] <%runegod20> do it bruce, kill them all
[2:50:53] <+StooEsq> like

[2:51:35] <marvel877> Inverted takedown
[2:51:35] <samuelfisk> Love the game over screens
[2:51:37] <Alejandroxciv> bullet damage high
[2:51:37] <masterfire23> inverted takedown is good
[2:51:38] <+Damie904> Get Inverted Takedown
[2:51:38] <StarlitStunner> That man had the accuracy of Deadshot
[2:51:38] <amiavamp> Batman would be a weak Persona 5 boss
[2:51:39] <dukenux> BAT vs GUN
[2:51:40] <FrostedZaibatsu> His suit is suppose to be bulletproof btw LUL
[2:51:41] <brian_peppers1> BULLETS HURT

[2:52:00] <jowi_time> yes the best one
[2:52:04] <DrkJP520> I don't think the noise was the issue. You kicked that guy right infront of his mate
[2:52:05] <+SWindleFeD> You can do loud takedowns, but you have to really know where each enemy is and where they're looking
[2:52:06] <%thechungiestofbois> Best one
[2:52:11] <+chiazam> Inverted Takedown
[2:52:12] <Ashenik1> @FrostedZaibatsu I mean id did protect him for like 50 shots
[2:52:15] <%krispen_wa> Oh, this room
[2:52:19] <%runegod20> perch takedown sounding hella nice with how rough going loud against guns look like
[2:52:29] <dork_doggler> Do the gel this time, you don‚Äôt have to be near to detonate
[2:52:34] <$emptyantics> Someone make a MUGEN video called Batman vs GUN
[2:52:39] <@akuda_bar> do you think batman feels any guilt at all about the fact these guys got kidnapped because he wouldnt break jokers neck
[2:53:03] <SteamShow> Probably not.
[2:53:11] <+nabs2099> No. he gets off to the thrill
[2:53:14] <@akuda_bar> @SteamShow acceptable losses
[2:53:19] <%KeiganOfAstora> What do you mean "I can?" Reggie is playing LUL
[2:53:19] <Spiralpower1620> Batman got the same weakness as his parents
[2:53:20] <dukenux> cant you afford the upgrade now?
[2:53:21] <Asuterisuku> Experience is tallied at the end of predator encounters, so you won't be able to get it until afterwards.
[2:53:22] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @emptyantics it exists, it's called Injustice 2 specifically
[2:53:23] <deviljhojho_> HE IS STARTING TO BELIEVE
[2:53:24] <%dreadedcthulhu> batarangs draw enemies to the spot they land
[2:53:25] <+evbites> @akuda_bar every day. it's the states fault
[2:53:26] <PWNMAKER> Nah batman loves an excuse to beat up criminals
[2:53:26] <dinnydanny777> I love that these superhero games are secretly stealth games LUL
[2:53:34] <alfredfromthedusk> Do you think $15 was what the Rocksteady employee who wrote that line made
[2:53:47] <Doctadaking> Once combat is over, upgrade points go through
[2:53:48] <johnnydalmann> you won't get xp until after an encounter
[2:53:52] <+chiazam> You can Quite Drop By TAPPING A
[2:54:04] <brunoberserk> he is learning
[2:54:08] <%GeneralSCPatton> Thousands of innocent bodies will stand as a monument to Batman's cowardi- I mean mercy
[2:54:10] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> BATMAN NEVER KILLED ANYONE
[2:54:12] <%krispen_wa> you think batman is human enough to feel guilt? a person who watches the joker murder literal thousands of people and NOT do anything isnt a human. he's a fucking monster
[2:54:12] <+SWindleFeD> Wait is this Woolies first time playing this?

[3:02:57] <dinnydanny777> He does not look safe LUL
[3:03:01] <Asuterisuku> Waylon's story is not a happy one period.

[3:03:59] <super_harley_dude> Never let them leave the corner
[3:04:00] <peachy996> So yeah punch while keeping an eagle eye for the counter. Also Cape stun is useful
[3:04:08] <Indigo_Automaton> How dramatic
[3:04:12] <ShiningAxis> no stun move here
[3:04:15] <+nabs2099> These Batman lines were cool when I was 11 but now at 24 its like... okay Bruce enough w the cheese and ham.

[3:05:29] <Visorak6> My favorite
[3:05:29] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> HUSH MY FAVORITE VILLAIN Kreygasm
[3:05:30] <%Parapattern> THE LAMEST
[3:05:33] <+Diamond_Dynamo> "I would've solved all the puzzles I came up with" lol
[3:05:34] <dork_doggler> HUSH IS GARBAGE
[3:05:36] <%runegod20> wait, isn't this kind of weird based on later games?
[3:05:39] <%krispen_wa> So wait, Hush exists before Hush happened in Arkam Knight?
[3:05:40] <+condemned_15> ah yes. Hush from Hush LUL
[3:05:41] <+Zeroblazex> So he got this one but ignored the Arkham spirit
[3:05:42] <Darren716> Hush looks like some stupid 90s shit
[3:05:47] <brachydios777> Hush is not great
[3:05:48] <%KeiganOfAstora> Hush was 2006 or so?
[3:05:49] <%Mrthefro> Riddler is actually just chat.
[3:05:50] <TheWizardOfWordplay> retcon
[3:05:50] <CanadianAdam> Hush is some stupid 90s shit
[3:05:53] <+BritishTyrannosaur> This is just comic bios
[3:05:55] <$eco419> Looks like a jojo
[3:05:58] <anAngryHamster> Craaaaaaaaaawling iiiiiiiiiin my skiiiiiiin
[3:06:01] <%Lion_kun> oh hey, the worst Batman storyline ever
[3:06:02] <dinnydanny777> That seems like a stupid plan for a sociopath
[3:06:03] <$emptyantics> Did JOE MAD do the art for these?
[3:06:03] <%ShinobiPhoenix> he comes back in this series
[3:06:03] <+Diamond_Dynamo> This is some really bad art of Hush tbh
[3:06:05] <%Javaa01> Hush is really lame, but he still gets a really good mission in one of the later games
[3:06:06] <peachy996> He's not great but he has a great look. Probably a Homage to Darkman
[3:06:06] <deviljhojho_> surgical i get it
[3:06:06] <journeytogetgood> can't believe the hush animated movie made hush the riddler
[3:06:07] <andre11dr> Hush is really cool
[3:06:09] <centuronstar> @krispen_wa Nah. This was more just fanservice/trivia.
[3:06:09] <%runegod20> what are those pants
[3:06:09] <Joestar1890> Spoilers for Batman: Hush
[3:06:10] <halfmasks> LOOK AT THIS DORK
[3:06:11] <samuelfisk> Arkham Asylum is filled villains that get introduced in City and Knight as if they were new.
[3:06:12] <dork_doggler> IT GARBAGE
[3:06:14] <%Grimlockfly> Hush sucked
[3:06:15] <%Noonoox12> WAIT, So he knows who batman IS
[3:06:15] <%sirisvirus> this is why the riddles are cool
[3:06:17] <%krispen_wa> Hush is super overrated as a comic book arc
[3:06:17] <+PikeBot> Hush is so lame
[3:06:19] <%KeiganOfAstora> The comic came out in 2003
[3:06:19] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Hush is the best, hes some rich white boy whos upset because he got the inheritance way later after plotting to get it way earlier
[3:06:20] <%Josef_Stryker> It's alright
[3:06:20] <zedravan> fairly new villain
[3:06:21] <DatAsuna> Hush is cool but his motive sucks
[3:06:22] <super_harley_dude> Hush as fucking garbage
[3:06:22] <%Uncle_Christian> 2003
[3:06:22] <+Undenizen> that's lame!
[3:06:23] <+memes_are_cancer> BEEFY
[3:06:24] <eldragon_1> Hush had great art
[3:06:26] <Depthcharge2030> Hush had that Jim Lee art
[3:06:26] <Asuterisuku> Hush DOES NOT know who Batman is.
[3:06:27] <wendigo172> Hush fucking sucks
[3:06:27] <StarlitStunner> Jason and Two-Face linked him good
[3:06:27] <brunoberserk> please dont watch the hush animated adaptation , IS SO BAD
[3:06:29] <+Walopoh> People hate Hush
[3:06:31] <nvst4rk> Hish is cool
[3:06:33] <dinnydanny777> He's HUGE, he's larger than Batman
[3:06:33] <%Dante_Namikaze1> This gets super retconned in the next game
[3:06:38] <meganicmp3> looks cool to me
[3:06:39] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Wait why did he blame Bruce for what Thomas did?
[3:06:39] <DracaenaLeaf> JoJo pose Kappa
[3:06:42] <puluxor> POUCHES
[3:06:43] <+taggerung403> Strength augmented by hate is something I need
[3:06:45] <UvBenServed> Needs more pouches
[3:06:46] <+Diamond_Dynamo> He sometimes looks better than that, pretty sure
[3:06:48] <phatmac16> Hush could be cool
[3:06:51] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> HES 90S SHIT AND I LOVE IT
[3:06:54] <centuronstar> Got that Vergil Devil May Cry Manga look
[3:06:55] <alphalejandro> Basically Hush: "I want everything from you Bruce, even your face"
[3:06:56] <coreybom> Wow the chat is has some SHITTY opinions. Kappa
[3:06:57] <+sombraxyz> Hush did a hell of a good job from what I remember
[3:07:02] <Murdercles> is this just Darkman???
[3:07:04] <dork_doggler> The Owls also fucking suck
[3:07:04] <%krispen_wa> Hush is lamer Prometheus. And Prometheus is ALREADY lame
[3:07:05] <%Josef_Stryker> Court of Owls is sooooo good
[3:07:06] <%doomerskeletor13> Court of Owls is good shit
[3:07:06] <%KeiganOfAstora> So good!
[3:07:06] <$eco419> No u
[3:07:07] <derap41> Not quite rob liefeld but getting there
[3:07:10] <$QueequegTheater> Court of Owls is great
[3:07:10] <+Walopoh> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli He was created in 2003 though
[3:07:10] <Halospaz117> Wait is Hush just Face/Off?
[3:07:11] <meganicmp3> i read it its alright
[3:07:12] <anAngryHamster> Bruce's dad saves Tommy's dad= Tommy hates Batman
[3:07:14] <peachy996> The Owl aren't bad
[3:07:18] <%ShinobiPhoenix> the twist the next appearance of Hush in these games is slick
[3:07:18] <+CoronetChris> I read Hush... I don't get the hype.
[3:07:18] <wendigo172> @halospaz117 yes
[3:07:21] <+SWindleFeD> @Murdercles pretty much
[3:07:22] <%psidefx> yes he is
[3:07:26] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @Walopoh he is, but his design screams peak 90s
[3:07:32] <agustorm123> Wow chat have good opinions
[3:07:36] <Asuterisuku> Woolie is sick of the Riddler's bullshit already.
[3:07:40] <super_harley_dude> Court of owls is a better story
[3:07:40] <+Walopoh> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli ok I get that
[3:07:43] <$QueequegTheater> Bane is Venom
[3:07:45] <+PikeBot> Hush, both the arc and the character, sucks ass.
[3:07:46] <%runegod20> that name isn't a good sign
[3:07:50] <%Javaa01> Hmmmm I wonder if
[3:07:53] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa
[3:07:54] <coreybom> @anangryhamster Well tommy hated him because he WANTED him to die.
[3:07:56] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Cash Money, we like him
[3:07:59] <%KeiganOfAstora> Hush, the first arc by Jeph Loeb is great. Everything after was shit
[3:07:59] <peachy996> Visually: I think the Court of Owls and Hush are great
[3:08:00] <%Th3SmartAlec> "You named them 'X?' Are you for real?"
[3:08:10] <dork_doggler> shoot it with what
[3:08:14] <Asuterisuku> That's a thing that happened in the Arkham Asylum comic in the leadup to this game.
[3:08:16] <+samuraiknack> Batman RIP is better than Court of Owls
[3:08:16] <Doctadaking> The guards in these games have a lot of personality. It‚Äôs great
[3:08:16] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> I love Hush because his design is cool and his motivations are Dio Phantom Blood levels of petty, its fucking great
[3:08:17] <amiavamp> mind bullets
[3:08:20] <meganicmp3> use the gun
[3:08:26] <%krispen_wa> So who is the best "Batman but evil", because it certainly wasnt Hush
[3:08:29] <%dreadedcthulhu> punch the wall Kyle Wayne
[3:08:32] <+Undenizen> Yo if these doctors need to go back to school if they think psychosis is *transmittable*
[3:08:35] <%KeiganOfAstora> Batman RIP is part of a larger arc called The Grant Morrison run
[3:08:37] <%doomerskeletor13> Hush looks 90s because he was designed by Jim Ler
[3:08:37] <rytisone> MY MIIINDS
[3:08:42] <penitentpendant> Oh right, I forgot mashing the counter prompt drops combo in this game
[3:08:43] <dukenux> "MY MIIIIND"
[3:08:46] <$QueequegTheater> Ah my skull spikes
[3:08:46] <%Mattais88> Tekken slowdown
[3:08:46] <%runegod20> a drug to help against mental issues named titan, it feels like naming an aspirin brand "Murder Fury"
[3:08:50] <+Negus_Rex> ow, my brain
[3:08:51] <%LCLSmoothie> MY MIIIIND
[3:08:52] <thebalticguy1> Woolie you keep killing your combo by early parrying
[3:08:53] <journeytogetgood> grant morrison run is great
[3:08:59] <%Th3SmartAlec> Razor no BibleThump
[3:09:03] <alfredfromthedusk> @krispen_wa Azrael is a pretty good example, since he's not even totally evil
[3:09:03] <+Superbro64> "best in the entire state" sounds funny when you think about it, especially if gotham is in new Jersey LUL
[3:09:06] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> no if you mash combos in this game you drop it, it wants you to do a rhythm, like a rhythm game
[3:09:12] <Murdercles> I mean, I guess these takedowns were ok until you saw Yakuza LUL
[3:09:14] <%RyTYoung> We know Bats LUL
[3:09:17] <%Jiggisnipe> Kappa Kappa
[3:09:18] <dukenux> Yeah sure whatever bats

[3:09:29] <Asuterisuku> I miss the next game's double takedowns already.
[3:09:30] <%Th3SmartAlec> Batman says, as he continues to let Joker run wild every other week
[3:09:32] <amiavamp> "I won't let innocent people die" says man responsible for hundreds dead
[3:09:34] <brunoberserk> HE IS FINE
[3:09:34] <%Mrthefro> That was a heat mover
[3:09:37] <dinnydanny777> That guy looked like he died LUL

[3:23:25] <+Walopoh> That's why he has a Teddy Bear still, becuase he had to fight to keep it in his prison-childhood
[3:23:27] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Bane in the Nolan movie just got relegated to Ra's side villain
[3:23:29] <alfredfromthedusk> Modern Bane is cool, I really dig it

[3:27:21] <joniroquai> Don't you know Woolie? Batman punches the crime right out of them, for regular goons atleast
[3:27:23] <%kingdovachief> kingdovachief subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! I feel like the next series woolie is gonna play is Bioshock
[3:27:23] <+Walopoh> I mean nothing in this asylum seems well adjusted so far LUL
[3:27:32] <gamewarden92> She has to work for her $20 an hour.
[3:27:32] <dukenux> Harley is Nurse Ratchet
[3:27:37] <Arancet> @Halospaz117 no VA's gonna turn down a steady gig
[3:27:38] <Minerslovegames> when was the last time anyone died from concussions
[3:27:41] <+Superbro64> Shit. Standing around for $15/hr sounds real nice
[3:27:49] <+condemned_15> pocket sand!
[3:27:51] <@Solidus_113> there's the stun
[3:27:52] <Asuterisuku> Third attack type.
[3:27:52] <anothernub> Is that henchman paid 15$ an hour?
[3:27:52] <dinnydanny777> Imagine the most special thing about yourself is having a knife
[3:27:54] <TraitGene2> could have been us but congress said no
[3:27:56] <+Walopoh> Not even going to take away his knives
[3:27:59] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> yep......
[3:28:00] <Halospaz117> @Arancet read the spelling of your other comment again
[3:28:04] <+DappercatEsquire> by the same guy behind American Horror Story, apparently
[3:28:07] <AncelDeLambert> siiiiiigh...
[3:28:10] <+Reverend_Roscoe> it sucks
[3:28:10] <%runegod20> hearing riddler's VO being the random guy doing the announcement thing is weirding me out
[3:28:11] <+funnyfunnykid> Happy Birthday, Bats! It's a new enemy type!
[3:28:12] <%Parapattern> WHy is that necessary
[3:28:13] <dukenux> They actually made it?
[3:28:17] <peachy996> They made a Clarice tvshow and I heard it's average
[3:28:17] <%GeneralSCPatton> If someone is knocked out for more than a few moments, they are definitely brain damaged
[3:28:18] <DelgotHansto> Leave muh buhyyy, san-uh-tarium
[3:28:22] <+CptBritches> That's not something that needs to be explored
[3:28:22] <Komayeda> The Jack Nicholson Cinematic Universe
[3:28:27] <%Juriasu> finally someone is making a cuckoos nest cinematic universe
[3:28:30] <Darren716> How could they make a series out of that? Like it doesn't seem like there'd be much to build off of
[3:28:37] <$BallerSwagBro9k> WHO?
[3:28:38] <devanmuse> Do you think that "Arkhamcare" website is/was a real site?
[3:28:39] <%doomerskeletor13> They also made a Clarice Sterling show that CAN‚ÄôT mention Hannibal because of copyright stuff
[3:28:41] <+bigb00gi3> won't someone PLEASE think of the poor prison wardens
[3:28:43] <+robosqueeb> take a shot every time woolie opens the map
[3:28:44] <zedravan> spin offs are the new remakes
[3:28:45] <Arancet> @Halospaz117 ah, ill just assume i screwed it all up since i suck at typing
[3:28:45] <TallPixels> joker movie
[3:28:47] <dukenux> But Ratchet wasnt even crazy, she was just a cog in the system. it was the whole piint
[3:28:50] <BourneWarrior> Ah yes the CNCU
[3:28:53] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @Komayeda dont tempt them, or youll have The Shining x Anger Management
[3:29:00] <amiavamp> We were just talking about Snowpiercer 2 a few hours ago
[3:29:01] <+condemned_15> The Show sucks and Nurse Rached was just a shitty person. Not Hannibal Lecter
[3:29:04] <Halospaz117> @Arancet ya spelt same with a C instead of an S :P
[3:29:09] <+trackles_64> authority?
[3:29:09] <s1rcuit> @Darren716 yeah, but making a series of shows make money, and execs can only think about money
[3:29:10] <Doctadaking> Time for that inverted takedown.
[3:29:10] <reonome> that voice sounds familiar
[3:29:13] <+ApocalypticExpress> these 2000s models I hate
[3:29:16] <+nabs2099> Once Upon a Time was a fantastic show until season 3.
[3:29:19] <Exodusprime1256> NUMBAH 5
[3:29:21] <+Walopoh> Cash, MONEY!
[3:29:24] <%runegod20> that seems like a pretty crappy prosthetic hand, tachabana had a better one in the late 80s
[3:29:29] <CanadianAdam> does Cash have a hook hand in this game?
[3:29:32] <peachy996> The models get better in City
[3:29:32] <AncelDeLambert> Everyone say hello to Susie from Rugrats
[3:29:37] <agustorm123> Is woolie hype for the Justice league directors cut?
[3:29:39] <NeonBleu> Be safe, Cree
[3:29:41] <%Javaa01> They have to be directly underneath
[3:29:42] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> TIME TO DO SCARE TAKEDOWNS
[3:29:43] <alphalejandro> There you go Woolie
[3:29:44] <daniphofani> @ApocalypticExpress this is why games that try to go for AAA Hyperrealism graphics age like milk
[3:29:45] <s1rcuit> @CanadianAdam I think he does
[3:29:45] <+xmetalicdemonx> @CanadianAdam yes
[3:29:49] <Darren716> They gotta be right under there to take themout
[3:29:53] <TraitGene2> everyone say hello to bunny rabbot from sonic the hedgehog
[3:29:54] <AthenaAegis> Ratchet is a show that exists. That's my review.
[3:29:58] <%runegod20> that is cree summers, she sounded familiar buti wasn't sure
[3:30:03] <$eco419> True
[3:30:06] <+Robob00p> @agustorm123 We live in a society
[3:30:22] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Nurse Ratched is morally gray now
[3:30:25] <AncelDeLambert> Remember, Ratchett was completely unqualified for her post as Head Nurse, and had no formal training, yet was in charge of deeply mentally unwell inmates
[3:30:27] <%Th3SmartAlec> yoink
[3:30:31] <dukenux> Billy PepeHands
[3:30:32] <$QueequegTheater> "Silent"
[3:30:33] <%krispen_wa> NO ONE HEARD ANYTHING
[3:30:35] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> drop him
[3:30:37] <thetrashman_sc> its fine
[3:30:37] <Asuterisuku> Totally conscious.
[3:30:37] <peachy996> Cut him down to spook the other guys
[3:30:38] <@Solidus_113> totally silent
[3:30:40] <+Diamond_Dynamo> You don't need to hang, just look down at them
[3:30:41] <Darren716> You can knock them down too
[3:30:43] <+condemned_15> was that bender?
[3:30:44] <deviljhojho_> if it works it works
[3:30:45] <brunoberserk> but is cool
[3:30:47] <reonome> AHHHHH
[3:30:48] <%RyTYoung> Dudes can notice them sometimes
[3:30:50] <%Uncle_Christian> wait till another guy comes to check on him
[3:30:51] <s1rcuit> @Ravioli_Ronin considering this is years into his crime fighting career, and is the only actually pushing back the lunatics, yeah!
[3:30:58] <%Javaa01> @WoolieVersus You can cut them down after they're strung up so you can drop them on inspecting enemies
[3:30:59] <+trackles_64> stealth is optional
[3:31:00] <%Th3SmartAlec> free
[3:31:01] <Johannen> Detective Vision the Game
[3:31:04] <%runegod20> it's loud but they still don't know where you are, and scaring them is a mechanic so it works
[3:31:04] <%thechungiestofbois> BIG FEAR
[3:31:06] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> YOU ARE THE NIGHT
[3:31:06] <+Walopoh> BOP
[3:31:08] <peachy996> Throw a batarang at the guy hanging
[3:31:08] <velgaduere> BOP
[3:31:12] <%ChoculaUltra> I'd imagine the sound of the actual grappling gun going off would be kinda loud no?
[3:31:14] <deviljhojho_> back of the head punch
[3:31:14] <PrideOfFiddles> BOP
[3:31:17] <Doctadaking> Speaking of fear...
[3:31:18] <+vaderxyz1970> Broke his neck is not Killing him

[3:31:35] <puluxor> LUL
[3:31:35] <%runegod20> the grappling hook sounds louder than silenced guns in fiction
[3:31:36] <amiavamp> Tension gauge maxed
[3:31:39] <user_naim> Is it clicking or rotating the sticks for the reverse angle glide kick?
[3:31:40] <Torgue_1> Don't riddles give you exp?
[3:31:41] <SheefEatsBeef> dont FUCK with me
[3:31:41] <DelgotHansto> Man stealth sections in Arkham Knight are so good
[3:31:45] <nvst4rk> pog
[3:31:50] <penitentpendant> The weird thing about EXP in this game is it also heals you. Part of the design point of the teeth is to allow you to heal between combat/stealth sections.
[3:31:50] <AncelDeLambert> this arena is great to go back to in future playthroughs, just to take advantage of the myriad takedown opportunities. Like the collapsible floor or breakthrough walls
[3:31:51] <%Th3SmartAlec> Jebaited

[3:34:37] <s1rcuit> so my hypothesis for why Batman doesn't kill Joker despite knowing he'll kill more citizens is that he's actually afraid of killing people, in an episode of the 90's cartoon Scarecrow hits him with a gas that makes him fearless and he almost offs a dude

[3:43:31] <%krispen_wa> isnt joker gas just mustard gas anyways
[3:43:32] <meganicmp3> remote is more useful in city
[3:43:34] <+DizzyGunner> multi batarang is more useful than you think
[3:43:36] <%Ether101_Prime> How many times has he gotten lost?
[3:43:39] <%GeneralSCPatton> 10 minutes on DMT is enough for Batman to learn astral projection and become a wizard

[3:43:46] <peachy996> What's the Remote Control Batarang like with PC controls?

[3:45:49] <%CptnCampy61> We understand
[3:45:49] <penitentpendant> @peachy996 He can't, permanently missable
[3:45:49] <RoboticRexkek> bat is no longer horny
[3:45:53] <Asuterisuku> They're optional, but they provide a lot of cool info.
[3:46:00] <+Damie904> Dude we dont want you to. Do em if they're convenient for ez exp, but fuck the riddles.
[3:46:00] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @seniormeatbox what did he miss? Afaik all riddles are obtainable
[3:46:02] <%Th3SmartAlec> Damn even Joker wants Woolie to do puzzles
[3:46:02] <brian_peppers1> MASH KING
[3:46:03] <+RPG_CHICAGO> @WoolieVersus also most of the key character art and designs were handled by Calos D'Anda who worked on DCUO and drew a few of the Wildstorm Resident Evil comics
[3:46:03] <%KyoryUtchy> If he thought it was Gordon until just now, then he straight up lied to Oracle when she asked if he found Gordon yet.
[3:46:05] <GarbageNirvana> At least you don't need them for the real ending in this one
[3:46:07] <%Dante_Namikaze1> it's only worth it in Arkham City because you can see how you fuck him up and it's tied to sing the ending for Arkham Knight but the only one where you could do it quickly was in Arkham origins
[3:46:10] <peachy996> @penitentpendant No he can go back for them
[3:46:17] <seniormeatbox> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli Morgue room can't be re-entered.
[3:46:19] <PanicSwytch> Its understandable but I had fun hunting the puzzles
[3:46:19] <Yung_FckUp> do a 100x combo
[3:46:19] <+mister___doctor> I feel like attention is what the Riddler wants anyway
[3:46:21] <meganicmp3> the amadeus arkham logs are cool tho
[3:46:21] <%Deft_Thought> These SFX are somethin
[3:46:23] <%mundanelotus> It helps not to spam the buttons one after the other but keep a rhythm
[3:46:24] <Asuterisuku> Also, nothing is permanently missable.
[3:46:25] <Doctadaking> Mashing too much. Be more deliberate with your presses
[3:46:33] <Depthcharge2030> that man was contorted into the floor
[3:46:36] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I don't remember if it;s this game or the next one, but theres a really good Beatdown combo after a stun that I love using
[3:46:37] <user_naim> Don‚Äôt mash, you have time
[3:46:40] <%runegod20> joker must spend a fortune on those teeth
[3:46:40] <MAX116030> I feel like Woolie masehes the melee when he should press like ritm game
[3:46:42] <%Jiggisnipe> people say hit confirm, Woolie Kappa
[3:46:42] <Johannen> Do Combo get more Style

[3:47:12] <+SvenHolgersson> Woolie Stares At Bench
[3:47:14] <%runegod20> it works pretty well for an old and beaten up wooden chair
[3:47:14] <Shardlab> I got creeped out playing certain parts of the game at first and then came to a realization: "I'm Batman. I'm the scariest damned thing in this game."
[3:47:15] <TraitGene2> every time i look at a block of wood i think, "look at how low poly this is"
[3:47:22] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I was playing City and I use the move a lot, but you have it by default, so I couldn;t remember if you have to buy it in this one and it's default in City

[3:49:14] <NoireRequiem> The thug talk is great
[3:49:18] <+evbites> the arkham timelie is waaayy too short
[3:49:19] <penitentpendant> I mean, if Half Life taught us anything, you SHOULD fear a crowbar
[3:49:21] <Darren716> Did Woolie get lost in a straight line?
[3:49:21] <+Walopoh> Kappa
[3:49:23] <+klooswep> "Batman? I'm not scared of him. I bet I could beat him single handed" -quote from man pummeled
[3:49:24] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Harley, you are better off with Ivy
[3:49:27] <dukenux> Kappa
[3:49:27] <Lancaster_H> did woolie manage to get lost in a straight road again
[3:49:28] <+Wildorox> Did you like Batman‚Äôs fight style in the Injustice games Woolie?
[3:49:31] <%ChoculaUltra> woolieFABRICATION
[3:49:31] <%krispen_wa> so if batman and his batfamily die, would superman just do double duty and save gotham himself
[3:49:37] <%gnoame> Gordon Freeman = Joker confirmed
[3:49:42] <%Th3SmartAlec> Go with Ivy Harley, she's better for you
[3:49:49] <Asuterisuku> Predator mission GO!
[3:49:56] <%Parapattern> "Bruce, I forgive you for not saving me. But why, why on God's earth is HE still alive?!"
[3:49:56] <+evbites> @krispen_wa nah somone else would step up
[3:49:56] <andre11dr> Gordon vs Terry is a 10-0 matchup
[3:49:59] <%Dante_Namikaze1> @krispen_wa you would have to kill like 20 people for their not to be a Batman replacement before Superman even steps in
[3:50:00] <dinnydanny777> Gordon kind of on his shit talking A game
[3:50:05] <meganicmp3> hide
[3:50:14] <amiavamp> Why did we never get an actual Predator game like this?
[3:50:15] <+Walopoh> HE GROOVING
[3:50:20] <Doctadaking> These guys can‚Äôt see more than 5 feet in front of them
[3:50:23] <%jonblnt> vents
[3:50:23] <KidKaiser23> Snap the neck
[3:50:26] <%krispen_wa> so we gotta kill 20 people before gotham is saved from being a shithole then. thats a decent sacrifice
[3:50:28] <Daxalog> When your unconscious or asleep your skeleton turns blue.
[3:50:30] <NoireRequiem> lo
[3:50:35] <%GeneralSCPatton> Fun fact: the only reason that crowbar happened is because of a phone poll, and it seems that a ton of votes came from one salty fan abusing the system.

[3:51:48] <$tallik44123> yeah ivy probably beats her slightly less but not by much
[3:51:50] <%Ether101_Prime> But does Woolie know about the big arm?
[3:51:53] <meganicmp3> notice the body strung up
[3:51:53] <mortificent> chat, Joker and Harley qualify as war criminals with their bodycount, right?
[3:51:55] <+Undenizen> There's a very awkward one with Killer Croc because they're trying to censor him eating your face.
[3:51:57] <+Walopoh> She says "I'M GONNA DIE" jermaMars
[3:52:04] <%krispen_wa> @coreybom yeah but superman would stop them waaaaay faster than batman's slow ass
[3:52:09] <Asuterisuku> Their vision really is garbage, though, and that' sfrom someone who's legally blind.
[3:52:11] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @Doctadaking
[3:52:12] <agustorm123> She is so obnoxius
[3:52:16] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> I feel like I've seen this exact room in Arkham City
[3:52:17] <+MattDemers> I enjoy how Woolie is now absorbed in the metagame of "never turn Detective Vision off"
[3:52:19] <KidKaiser23> @tallik44123 No, Ivy BEATS IT UP, she does not beat her up
[3:52:24] <%Parapattern> @mortificent Yeah, that's true with every Batman villain

[3:52:39] <Murdercles> its not their fault, they need Big Boss' remains to fix their shitting genome vision
[3:52:41] <Lancaster_H> that guard is almost as blind as woolie
[3:52:42] <+taggerung403> joker only hires clowns
[3:52:43] <+Undenizen> he's very short sighted.
[3:52:44] <penitentpendant> I think LoS for them is from Center of Mass?
[3:52:46] <%runegod20> @mortificent Oh, well beyond kill count, easily jeneva convention broken 5 times over
[3:52:46] <@Solidus_113> that skeleton...
[3:52:47] <Pyrrhus90> a clown? so on brand?
[3:52:48] <%Uncle_Christian> Glaucoma
[3:52:55] <mr_saturday93> Woolie/Paige levels of blind
[3:52:57] <Daxalog> Unless its like Arma. Or splinter cell.
[3:53:00] <s1rcuit> @WoolieVersus turn detective mode off near the floating skeleton
[3:53:02] <%KeiganOfAstora> Real life peripheral vision makes it too tough
[3:53:04] <velgaduere> there's a realism mod for MGSV and it is NOT fucking fun lmao
[3:53:05] <meganicmp3> be patient?
[3:53:05] <rytisone> there's tons of things that would make games not fun
[3:53:09] <amiavamp> Try MGS5 with boosted sight range, it's near impossible
[3:53:12] <Halospaz117> But I want hard stealth game tho
[3:53:22] <tattleworm> that's why you gotta have a camo index
[3:53:22] <Asuterisuku> Has Woolie figured out who's in the cell yet?
[3:53:23] <%SainEdge> yeah, real world stealth would be terrible
[3:53:26] <+Walopoh> LUL
[3:53:27] <%runegod20> yeah, if you do realisitc sight, sound, an enemies getting alerted, stealth would be too hard
[3:53:28] <+Diamond_Dynamo> Optional realistic los could be fun. Like, if you give your stealth game a "simulator" difficulty or something
[3:53:29] <mortificent> yeye, I always like to remember that these villains are aaaawful people
[3:53:32] <+Superbro64> You'd be impressed how stupid humans can actually be at noticing things woolie
[3:53:41] <DelgotHansto> Thief nearly did it, the good ones at least
[3:53:48] <+SWindleFeD> Yeah playing Sniper: ghost warrior 1 on hard mode makes the enemies eye sight go into super mode
[3:53:48] <meganicmp3> forget it its not important
[3:53:51] <+condemned_15> cheep cheep cheep
[3:53:51] <%TubeMan642> that's Bane in there
[3:53:51] <+coward_man> like how realistically in the distances shooters take place a shotgun would be god king of the universe?
[3:53:53] <+evbites> Stairs
[3:53:54] <Doctadaking> Just take the stairs
[3:53:59] <TraitGene2> stairs at the back
[3:53:59] <Halospaz117> Or at the very least gimme Chaos Theory level stealth, FUCK I MISS SPLINTER CELL
[3:54:00] <snakest3alth> Stairs
[3:54:00] <mr_red117> stairs
[3:54:00] <specialpipo> Oof
[3:54:01] <+Undenizen> "Won again"?? when has he EVER won??
[3:54:01] <Johannen> Nice heart monitor tech, I wonder if he even shared it with the world
[3:54:03] <dinnydanny777> I think realistic stealth would push you into not engaging in combat at all
[3:54:04] <Komayeda> There are LITERALLY Stairs
[3:54:05] <+Walopoh> Stairs
[3:54:06] <ScreamLord> I was about to say MGS would be torture with realistic site range

[3:58:04] <Asuterisuku> It might be related to taking out the thugs first.
[3:58:07] <%RyTYoung> ITS YOUR STANDO

[3:58:26] <OblivionSword1> Are you sure you're not cursed Woolie ?
[3:58:28] <%GeneralSCPatton> Are soft-locks the same class as save-corruption? Does it depend on whether manual saves exist?
[3:58:33] <TheChapyGuy> I've never seen that, and I've almost only played on PC
[3:58:34] <+DrPoxx> might be a detective vision bug
[3:58:35] <peachy996> I think it was the sudden roll for the trophy that did it
[3:58:35] <dundore77> deactivate detective mode before doing it
[3:58:35] <Pyrrhus90> woolie is QA powers are out of control
[3:58:38] <RyuuAoi> When's stream where Woolie just bugs stuff? Oh that's EVERY STREAM

[3:58:46] <TreeLeafBoi> You never truly leave QA
[3:58:47] <+CptBritches> Pretty sure the bug happened due to switching detective vision during the animation
[3:58:51] <TheWizardOfWordplay> don't use detective mode for the takedown
[3:58:51] <Alejandroxciv> is your bless and your curse woolie
[3:58:51] <andre11dr> Woolie is slowly developing his stand
[3:58:54] <+DizzyGunner> pat has crazy talk, woolie has QA powers
[3:58:58] <KidKaiser23> We are QA
[3:59:00] <Asuterisuku> Just go up the stairs directly to Harley.
[3:59:00] <%HitchhikingThrough> The important question: CAN IT BE REPLICATED
[3:59:02] <mdkcde> this seems like an anti-crack feature
[3:59:03] <Doctadaking> The second you hit the takedown prompt, it‚Äôs supposed to cut to a prerendered cutscene
[3:59:05] <dork_doggler> @Mattais88 They bugged the fuck outta the dragon god fight
[3:59:07] <+nightwing1936> Turn off Detective Mode for that takedown woolz
[3:59:07] <%CateHecate> [BRING ME TO LIFE] Act 2: [Bedbugs and Ballyhoo]
[3:59:09] <therealtacopancakes> maybe it had to do with detective vision forcing a skeleton on harley?
[3:59:13] <$SirGO0SE> @Mattais88 they bugged the dragon hard
[3:59:18] <RyuuAoi> @dizzygunner Lock it in
[3:59:18] <Lancaster_H> turn off detective vision before triggering it @WoolieVersus
[3:59:19] <diontmack> has woolie been stabbed with an arrow recently?
[3:59:26] <+lordericter> do it again
[3:59:26] <DelgotHansto> Crash and a soft lock so far, whens that save corruption baby
[3:59:26] <meganicmp3> he's the leader of the bunch you know him well
[3:59:27] <+nomad390> Yeah I wonder it Detective Mode did it?
[3:59:29] <%RyTYoung> wait till I kick your ass into an electric field Harley LUL
[3:59:33] <TraitGene2> there we go
[3:59:35] <Doctadaking> I think the detective mode did it, cus that was the problem in the video I saw before
[3:59:36] <%kyh9> Get fucked
[3:59:38] <Asuterisuku> THAT'S what was supposed to happen.
[3:59:39] <s1rcuit> @Lancaster_H does that trigger the bug each time?

[3:59:46] <cheap_turbo> that's some crazy shit
[3:59:47] <Pyrrhus90> it was detective vision LUL
[3:59:49] <NoireRequiem> it was detective vision switching
[3:59:51] <%ShinobiPhoenix> detective vision glitched it?
[3:59:52] <+Walopoh> Failed cutscene trigger
[3:59:53] <Tooniearcade> Loll
[3:59:55] <cosmov06> You triggered a NORMAL takedown XD
[3:59:55] <Dimmensional> @WoolieVersus maybe it was the xray
[3:59:57] <3Xgilly> could have been detective vision
[3:59:57] <%AnthroMetal> detective vision?
[3:59:57] <Jashter18> Bring Me To Life has evolved
[3:59:58] <Darren716> She is put as a normal guard for the gameplay segment and you somehow actually targetted her
[4:00:00] <RyuuAoi> WOW
[4:00:01] <KidKaiser23> It was Detective Vision
[4:00:03] <CoffeeSlice> THE SPOILER
[4:00:03] <meganicmp3> you did it too good
[4:00:04] <Lancaster_H> @s1rcuit its the first time im seeing THIS one but detective vision can bug some shit occassionally yeah

[4:00:31] <diontmack> YOU'RE A SMALL GUY
[4:00:32] <dinnydanny777> Is that JENOVA LUL
[4:00:32] <peachy996> This Bane design... sucks

[4:00:35] <meganicmp3> LANKY
[4:00:35] <snakest3alth> Bame looks like doghsit
[4:00:36] <%kewlmyc> FOR YOU
[4:00:38] <PanicSwytch> BRUJA
[4:00:40] <+PikeBot> I think they must have Harley skinned over a grunt, since you can't really see her anyway, so that you can trigger the takedown prompt. Once the cutscene starts they swap her out for herself. But the cutscene never happened so there was just Grunt Harley sitting there forever.
[4:00:40] <%krispen_wa> UUUU

[4:06:16] <mudamudajo> @dukenux As shit as Clooney bane is. At least he was just a big muscle dude. This is like the damn hulk. I guess the excuse "Titan" but he just looks and acts like shit.

[4:06:19] <brachydios777> Origins has some pretty good boss fights

[4:06:53] <+bassoontyphoon> Batman doing some tactical CBT
[4:06:58] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> hes learnding
[4:07:01] <$emptyantics> Arkham Origins is my favorite Batham game
[4:07:03] <TraitGene2> get x8 and you'll have that takedown
[4:07:05] <%kewlmyc> Quit getting greedy. Put down your shield.
[4:07:17] <Asuterisuku> ... I think I actually forgot how Batman and Robin went, guys.
[4:07:17] <+SolidusRex> Did Bane say "I will fuck you"?
[4:07:18] <Johannen> @KeiganOfAstora Not City? What about Freeze? I though Origins was prety generic
[4:07:20] <%krispen_wa> arkham origins is a great game that had some questionable gameplay decisions
[4:07:20] <%KeiganOfAstora> When you get real smooth with the combat it looks so brutal. Arkham Origins has some of the coolest predator rooms too
[4:07:22] <Jane_Lo> is this the original release or that remaster collection? cause i think original is more blue-ish, right?
[4:07:27] <mudamudajo> @asuterisuku no. I'm just referring to the Clooney batman film that bane appeared in.
[4:07:30] <+CptBritches> LIKE PAPERRR
[4:07:33] <peachy996> Yeah the Health Points are not useless upgrades for your first time
[4:07:40] <$priceyyeti40> Woolie why?
[4:07:42] <%jonblnt> @Jane_Lo Original
[4:07:50] <%KeiganOfAstora> @Johannen Freeze was the best fight in the entire series!!
[4:07:51] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @Jane_Lo PC original
[4:07:52] <%Deft_Thought> Bane getting reduced from the "Man who broke the Bat" in Knightfall to a muscle goon or a jobber for the League of Assassins was always such a disappointment.
[4:07:59] <KidKaiser23> 2 more
[4:08:00] <Komayeda> Okay woolie, so you don't need to actually hit him unless he's way down in health, the wall runs do the damage that matter

[4:10:48] <%eyezehuhh> Yes he's spanish
[4:10:49] <kamenspidey> because he's mexican, they tend to do that
[4:10:49] <+nomad390> THIS TIME I BREAK YOU - Batman
[4:10:50] <Johannen> Is Reggie only familiar with Bane from the Movie?
[4:10:50] <wasdknife> what does batman and kiru have incomon? never killed no one
[4:10:50] <brunoberserk> ABSOLUTE UNIT

[4:13:01] <mortificent> Bane is super smart
[4:13:05] <%Javaa01> 4 U
[4:13:13] <Condor64_> origins makes Bane a little more interesting, but he's pretty much dumb muscle man in the first few games
[4:13:14] <+Robob00p> In Arkham knight it days he‚Äôs a badass even without his venom
[4:13:14] <mudamudajo> Thats bullshit. Without venom he's still a huge dude. He trained his body in prison before venom.

[4:13:48] <SheefEatsBeef> gotham just wants healthcare batman...
[4:13:48] <brachydios777> Bane was scared of Bats, so beating Batman is beating his fears
[4:13:49] <penitentpendant> If this game has proven anything, comic book writers weren't aware of the Square/Cube law for a while
[4:13:50] <%ShinobiPhoenix> calling someone from South America Mexican is legit actually racist

[4:14:12] <%aurasviel> Woolie there‚Äôs a Batcave in YOUR APARTMENT RIGHT NOW
[4:14:12] <%runegod20> at least batman making a secondary bat cave on arkham isn't super crazy
[4:14:13] <%Uncle_Christian> Batman is the most paranoid man ever,he plans for anything n everything.
[4:14:13] <PKSomething> How much prep time does Kevin get?
[4:14:14] <Wild_Samurai> Love this part of the game. Retreat to your secret Bat Cave lol
[4:14:15] <passserby> bear would win versus gorilla

[4:14:25] <%krispen_wa> Okay, but what if Batman with time to plan fights Flash who travels back in time
[4:14:26] <gunsrlove> Eh, it's not much different to when JoJo characters keep out-predicting each other in every single fight.
[4:14:27] <%Wulfphelz> Batman TTP, truly the ultimate being LUL
[4:14:27] <%Juriasu> Woolie knows LUL

[4:14:34] <slix3431> Woolie took a round
[4:14:36] <Komayeda> I thought he was talking about Daigo from Yakuza
[4:14:36] <DomonTrigger> Woolie after eating 4 shoryukens in a row
[4:14:36] <%Rafoki> ok out of all the pre-planned johns that batman has. Having a base on Arkham is the most realistic
[4:14:37] <%ThatGuyThere03> Superman off rip isn't that strong
[4:14:37] <+mister___doctor> Goku wants to kill Batman but Batman already has the Dragon Balls
[4:14:39] <majindusto> Bane, Played by Tom Hardy...who would eventually play VENOM
[4:14:39] <+MikeNmurdoc> superman is free to daigo LUL

[4:14:52] <bevyrage> i don't think batman with time to plan beats daigo with time to study
[4:14:53] <%Th3SmartAlec> The plan is just Kyrptonite, that's not exactly a master plan LUL
[4:14:53] <+drk_sd> batman would macro his buttons
[4:14:54] <deviljhojho_> RUN IT
[4:14:54] <redrins> pre or post download daigo?
[4:14:55] <Condor64_> I thought Daigo was superman?
[4:14:58] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> He didn't think things were bad enough to mention the Arkham Asylum batcave until now
[4:14:59] <RyuuAoi> If Batman can plan, he wins.
[4:15:00] <TraitGene2> has a batcave on arkham, still can't figure out how everyone always escapes
[4:15:01] <%runegod20> if he was gonna have one anywhere, this is probably the best place

[4:15:18] <%marrs_bars> It's da baht WutFace
[4:15:19] <Johannen> Ughh...those droped Combos
[4:15:20] <+mister___doctor> Cape physics
[4:15:21] <@Solidus_113> don't mash
[4:15:24] <Yung_FckUp> do big combo
[4:15:29] <Asuterisuku> The mashing is wild.
[4:15:31] <T_Sasquatch> seriously counters are eas y as fuck lmao
[4:15:33] <KidKaiser23> @generalscpatton Fax, and that movie sucks
[4:15:34] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:15:34] <%ChoculaUltra> "Post-Download Daigo" is def getting added to the tier list LUL
[4:15:34] <brunoberserk> god , woolie is mashing like a fucking musou
[4:15:35] <meganicmp3> greedy counter man
[4:15:35] <+Superbro64> hit him harder 4Head
[4:15:37] <LordOfThePoultry> don't mash
[4:15:38] <+CloudsBringRain> woolie mash is off the charts rn
[4:15:40] <Exodusprime1256> SLAP slap slap, clap clap clap
[4:15:41] <dinnydanny777> SourPls
[4:15:44] <slix3431> This combat music is nicer
[4:15:44] <TraitGene2> does he have the ORAORA yet
[4:15:47] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @dukenux it's Xenatos, the trope itself makes that clear
[4:15:49] <+EmptyFist> lol why are you making it so hard
[4:15:49] <+TechnoSyndrome> he's just figuring out how it works
[4:15:50] <Doctadaking> You have a lot more time to counter than you think.
[4:15:51] <+sevorai> @WoolieVersus the combat is a rhythm game
[4:15:53] <%mundanelotus> I got stuck waiting to counter and it messed up my combos
[4:15:55] <coreybom> @th3smartalec Thats if supes isn‚Äôt ACTUALLY trying to kill him. If supes wanted actually dead, kryptonite can‚Äôt stop him.
[4:15:55] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Woolie its a rhythm game, think of it like a rhythm game
[4:15:56] <therealtacopancakes> this is a rhytm game, see blue press y
[4:15:56] <majindusto> SO MUCH DROPPED COMBOS
[4:16:01] <T_Sasquatch> NOPE counter literally overrides any attack
[4:16:02] <@Solidus_113> you're buffering in extra attacks that'll miss
[4:16:02] <+evbites> combat is a bit of a mess in thease games
[4:16:04] <capnqwark> RHYTHM YES
[4:16:05] <andre11dr> Man,vampire Batman is so dumb but kinda cool
[4:16:05] <MAX116030> yeah combat has a ritm to it
[4:16:08] <Lancaster_H> @WoolieVersus you whiff once = your combo is gone
[4:16:13] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Mashing drops your combo
[4:16:16] <%kewlmyc> Rhythm is the key word
[4:16:18] <dinnydanny777> I think you can cancel into counter
[4:16:21] <peachy996> City's Combat Challenges are fun. Iceberg Lounge is wild
[4:16:22] <deviljhojho_> avoiding counters unless they are necessary and switching enemies around for extra mobiity is the key i think
[4:16:22] <dundore77> Its a lower/older form of the Shadow of Mordor system if you played that
[4:16:23] <Asuterisuku> The reason not to is that the combo drops and you can't do your big special moves.
[4:16:24] <YVESSAINTMORON_> Arkham knight = mash mash mash mash counter
[4:16:26] <DrkJP520> Timing your attacks is best. Same in Shadow of Mordor
[4:16:27] <@Solidus_113> dropping the combo means no takedown
[4:16:28] <+AnIrishPapaya> Mashing literally drops all combos and buffs sooo
[4:16:29] <+TheTyper> Reason: Cause perfect timing feels perfect in this game
[4:16:31] <PinoProxie> PREPARED
[4:16:31] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Higher rhythm combo makes the enemies drop faster
[4:16:33] <user_naim> You can get stuck in an attack, but often you have time
[4:16:35] <@akuda_bar> creepy squatter batman
[4:16:36] <%Seancicle> they deserve to live Woolie
[4:16:36] <%Uncle_Christian> Batman was able to dodge Lord Darkseid's Omega Beam.
[4:16:37] <%Th3SmartAlec> Good to know you're looking out for the inmates and not the guards, Batman
[4:16:39] <+JacknZack27> Its a lot of fun to get into the rhythm of the fights
[4:16:39] <Komayeda> Oh, just the ol' Arkham Asylum Suicide Ledge
[4:16:39] <kamenspidey> keep mashin' don't listen to anybody you do you
[4:16:39] <+coward_man> no mash, also counter cancels out your attack
[4:16:50] <meganicmp3> he is LEARNING
[4:16:50] <%Javaa01> Also mashing counter kills your combo
[4:16:50] <Condor64_> is Woolie planning planning on doing other games in the Arkham series?
[4:16:51] <majindusto> DO COMBO
[4:16:55] <%Wulfphelz> It's stupid how it's actually a good explanation on why he has a second batcave LUL
[4:16:58] <%LCLSmoothie> do combo!
[4:17:01] <penitentpendant> Learnin' the system~
[4:17:03] <+RJay80> doodMash mash harder
[4:17:04] <+Walopoh> 4Head
[4:17:04] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Because mashing leaves you open
[4:17:06] <deviljhojho_> 4Head
[4:17:07] <%big_laser_boss> Maybe if you use the Quick-change clothes.... alright I'm out
[4:17:08] <Doctadaking> In harder difficulties, the blue indicators go away on enemies
[4:17:09] <ralphfromdk> Also... if I remember right, higher combo means more xp?
[4:17:10] <SixthShinx> Sure it was, Edward
[4:17:10] <%chosenjuan42> Is Woolie gonna Lab Arkham?
[4:17:11] <+AnIrishPapaya> "learning"
[4:17:11] <Rojahh> Lab it in your own time woolie
[4:17:11] <mortificent> Fuck you Riddler
[4:17:14] <T_Sasquatch> Woolie Mashen
[4:17:16] <MAX116030> Woolie do you mash in spiderman game?
[4:17:16] <TheSmerdis> The critical combo is way stronger and requires NOT to mash
[4:17:16] <%Mrthefro> It's so smart. Some moves tied to combo so keep it high.
[4:17:18] <$emptyantics> I hope you guys play the best Batman game, AkrhamOrigins
[4:17:19] <+CloudsBringRain> you don't get to use that upgrade you got for double damage when you mash
[4:17:20] <Asuterisuku> The map you got is only for inside the Medical Pavillion.
[4:17:24] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Better take another look at those critical hits, cause you have landed maybe 2 accidentally
[4:17:26] <rytisone> lets hide all the high tech stuff on the island that an escaped inmate could find. great plan batman
[4:17:27] <Johannen> Losing counter>Less Specials and Big Combo>More XP
[4:17:29] <peachy996> Nah it won't
[4:17:33] <+evbites> the riddler trophies in city are mandatory because the interviews are god tier
[4:17:34] <AvroEltz> Woolie, batman doenst have electricity
[4:17:35] <BoSteed> Batman's battle damage during this game blew my mind back then.
[4:17:36] <%bearwagon> nah u can just grapply away
[4:17:37] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[4:17:38] <meganicmp3> it will believe in it
[4:17:39] <Lancaster_H> also, higher your combo = longer your range becomes, you can leap entire rooms at 30+ combo counts @WoolieVersus
[4:17:39] <PanicSwytch> Dont double tap
[4:17:40] <penitentpendant> Rebel Up
[4:17:45] <ShiningAxis> damn the riddler is hella good at climbing
[4:17:48] <amiavamp> That's just like any game with "double tap direction to dodge". turn that shit off whenever you're in a game with it
[4:17:49] <+Timothyer> Only Chinese Batman has electricity
[4:17:52] <+Superbro64> If Riddler thinks he's smart, why doesnt he name every riddle? jiyuTurnt
[4:18:02] <+DizzyGunner> woolie finding more reasons not to mash Kappa
[4:18:02] <Doctadaking> Health. Health. Health.
[4:18:03] <velgaduere> it's not that unintuitive, thankfully
[4:18:04] <%Th3SmartAlec> So as long as you're not... Mashing? LUL
[4:18:04] <AvroEltz> Just dont mash A
[4:18:08] <meganicmp3> mashing on the collectibles too
[4:18:12] <SheefEatsBeef> oh, you like riddles? name every riddle then
[4:18:12] <@Solidus_113> that's good
[4:18:14] <NeonBleu> so...no mashing Kappa
[4:18:15] <Johannen> Your Combo counter is literaly your style meter
[4:18:19] <+coward_man> @Superbro64 if you asked him to he would
[4:18:21] <peachy996> That's good too
[4:18:23] <majindusto> More Combo = More Attacks
[4:18:27] <WanderingSwordsman> If you pay attention, you'll notice Batman's costume get increasing battle damage over time
[4:18:28] <ireliaismaiwaifu> so... stop mashing?
[4:18:28] <%ZweihanderSteve> warg
[4:18:29] <+sovietbatman64> Yo this layout looks fresh
[4:18:32] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> the sucky part is this game doesnt have the good lab training, the later games lets you do challenges that are good for labbing the combat
[4:18:32] <thefranchise00> that art looks sick tho
[4:18:32] <%GeneralSCPatton> 5 instead of 8? Shadow of Mordor literally has that!
[4:18:33] <+PikeBot> If you use the doidge towards enemies, you'll dodge over them, which will preserve your combo count. YOu can do any number of dodge-overs without losing your combo, but only one regular dodge.
[4:18:43] <%LCLSmoothie> batman is losing his mind in that art lol
[4:18:44] <moonmintparadise> Kreygasm
[4:18:44] <velgaduere> @GeneralSCPatton :)
[4:18:46] <deviljhojho_> yeah dodge overs are king
[4:18:47] <dinnydanny777> I thought Batman's screaming mouth was some kind of abyss
[4:18:49] <brunoberserk> batman screams to level up his armor LUL
[4:18:56] <peachy996> Health Upgrades are not a waste for you
[4:18:57] <%ChoculaUltra> Batman looks so done with bullets in that art
[4:19:00] <SheefEatsBeef> Da na na na na na!
[4:19:00] <%Th3SmartAlec> Kappa
[4:19:01] <+PlagueOfGripes> oh shit, you're finally playing this
[4:19:01] <PanicSwytch> Batman has multiple Bat caves
[4:19:01] <Darren716> Do you blame him for having it?
[4:19:01] <dukenux> "Aaaahhhh"
[4:19:02] <coreybom> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli But this one has challenges as well?
[4:19:02] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> ITS SUPER SECRET
[4:19:03] <BoSteed> Nope
[4:19:04] <meganicmp3> of course
[4:19:04] <%Wulfphelz> LUL LUL LUL
[4:19:05] <%smyld> But woolie, I thought you like your customization
[4:19:05] <+coward_man> you'll see why Woolie
[4:19:05] <+Walopoh> NOPE NAHHH
[4:19:06] <+evbites> It's gotham
[4:19:09] <sonofthedeepsouth> YES
[4:19:10] <%Irridium> HE PLANNED AHEAD
[4:19:10] <AvroEltz> You will know why they didnt
[4:19:11] <LVL1_Scumbag> BIG SECRETS
[4:19:12] <Doctadaking> When you see where it is, you‚Äôll see how no one discovered it.
[4:19:15] <%Dante_Namikaze1> No because it's really out of the way
[4:19:15] <+Damie904> You'll see why
[4:19:16] <%marrs_bars> Well they did, and the Bat Security "knocked them out"
[4:19:18] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @WanderingSwordsman only this game, not so much City or Knight, especially if you use some of the DLC costumes
[4:19:19] <+MikeNmurdoc> $15 an hour Woolie!!!
[4:19:19] <%jonblnt> not paid enough to look for a batcave
[4:19:21] <velgaduere> depends on where you find it
[4:19:21] <Blank9> $15/hr isn't enough to find a bat cave
[4:19:21] <andre11dr> NO ,HE THAT GOOD AT HIDING IT
[4:19:24] <majindusto> IT'S A SECRET
[4:19:24] <%chosenjuan42> planned ahead
[4:19:30] <%Jiggisnipe> in Robot Chicken, his maid finds the normal batcave
[4:19:31] <%Feralspirit41> They get paid $15 an hour are they really gonna tell BATMAN he cant do something
[4:19:31] <penitentpendant> Woolie's figurin' it out!
[4:19:32] <ULTRA__64> He's got a knive! doodTerror
[4:19:32] <peachy996> Knife Boys are a challenge
[4:19:36] <KidKaiser23> Do you think Arkham pays their guards enough to be thorough, Woolie?
[4:19:40] <+condemned_15> My MIIIIND
[4:19:40] <+Walopoh> It's pretty well hidden tbf LUL
[4:19:40] <Asuterisuku> Can't counter knife attacs until the next game.
[4:19:41] <Frostydough1> all the accidental discoveries ended up in accidental fatal injuries soon after
[4:19:42] <Doctadaking> Ground finishers aren‚Äôt worth it
[4:19:43] <AncelDeLambert> Woolie for the love of god user your counters
[4:19:44] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @coreybom it does but the combat challenges in this game isnt as well defined as later games, believe me this is my favorite Arkham game but its also the most "early" version of the combat
[4:19:45] <AvroEltz> Also, he found it by aciddent
[4:19:45] <BoSteed> NotLikeThis
[4:19:47] <+EmptyFist> B
[4:19:47] <vnzuelandude> this game is 2009 right?
[4:19:47] <+DizzyGunner> knives when you get the upgrade are easy
[4:19:48] <Darren716> Yes
[4:19:49] <%ShinobiPhoenix> if you find the Batcave, you hope he'll hire you instead
[4:19:51] <+mister___doctor> @WoolieVersus Always stop to counter when you see the blue, you'll keep your combo going
[4:19:52] <%Javaa01> It will always interrupt
[4:19:54] <OblivionSword1> yeas actually
[4:19:54] <+xmetalicdemonx> yes
[4:19:54] <+TheTyper> You can hold dodge to avoid the knife boys that are red
[4:19:55] <+coward_man> no just dodge
[4:19:55] <mr_red117> yes
[4:19:56] <%LCLSmoothie> yes
[4:19:57] <Halospaz117> It always stuns, yes
[4:19:59] <zedravan> 15$/hr woolie
[4:20:00] <thebalticguy1> It is not a counter
[4:20:01] <+sevorai> B always interrupts @WoolieVersus
[4:20:04] <keankong85> stun or dodge red attacks
[4:20:05] <capnqwark> Yes
[4:20:06] <coreybom> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli Oh yeah true. Very true.
[4:20:11] <+Walopoh> Just wait...
[4:20:13] <+Birdro> B is a stun attack, not counter based
[4:20:15] <peachy996> @TheTyper I always found that dodge weird.
[4:20:16] <+JacknZack27> Yeah. You can do it at anytime
[4:20:16] <BoSteed> NO ONE EVER
[4:20:16] <%Uncle_Christian> wait for it
[4:20:16] <penitentpendant> "Electrocution" oh right. Those enemies...
[4:20:18] <TheChapyGuy> lol it's not quite that simle
[4:20:18] <Doctadaking> Hold on
[4:20:18] <+Superbro64> only one way to find out Kappa
[4:20:20] <+Damie904> Wait for it
[4:20:20] <AncelDeLambert> prepare to eat crow, Woolie
[4:20:20] <@Commando_Joe> Alright I gotta step out, but the rest of the mods have their safeties off, so watch yourselves chat

[4:20:57] <RedSqurrl> Ajunta Pall??
[4:20:58] <+TheTyper> @peachy996 It totally is. But I think it's a mite faster if you're on the last second of a knife attack vs. a cape swing. The cape swing has to dive in before it lands.

[4:22:01] <Fuji808> @big_laser_boss Half correct, you lose your combo if you vault over enemies back to back without attacking between them.
[4:22:01] <%Wulfphelz> Nice.
[4:22:02] <brunoberserk> riddler is backseating the LP LUL
[4:22:03] <%Th3SmartAlec> Why are there skulls

[4:28:51] <+mister___doctor> When did he have the time for this shit?
[4:28:51] <meganicmp3> no. infinite hole.
[4:28:53] <+dapperdoop> maybe it's a natural cavern?
[4:28:54] <%HollowedIdjit> I mean let's be real, Clark would probably let him
[4:28:54] <dinnydanny777> Would you fall into the water safely and be trapped, forever, in a pit of freezing water in a cave?
[4:28:55] <redrins> there's a drainage system Kappa
[4:28:55] <sonofthedeepsouth> Woolie he is batman of course he dugged
[4:28:59] <Johannen> Woolie just cant help it to try and prove that he might be right)

[4:29:00] <user_naim> So he has a Batcave on other planets, right?
[4:29:01] <SpookyMooks> what is this bruce? i thought batman doesn't kill

[4:30:08] <%mundanelotus> why would he brand crates lol
[4:30:12] <%Exiliator> Sort of a puzzle
[4:30:13] <+mister___doctor> It says Wayne Tech on it, if someone found this cave he'd be fucked
[4:30:15] <+Undenizen> Bruce, maybe don't put your COMPANY LOGO IN THE BAT CAVE.
[4:30:16] <%xcompleasedad> Just throw your trash into the water 4Head
[4:30:17] <sonofthedeepsouth> why tho

[4:30:23] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Littering
[4:30:24] <Frodiddly> Tutorial purposes
[4:30:24] <penitentpendant> Both, it's actually decent in combat to stop combodrop
[4:30:25] <+TheTyper> You will never use the grapples to pull boxes EVER AGAIN
[4:30:27] <@Solidus_113> and those boxes go into the abyss
[4:30:28] <+Jakev91489> Oh shit we playing Arkham boys?!
[4:30:32] <KaiserMario> Each of those crates costs a $1000.00
[4:30:32] <+Damie904> You can use it in combat too as a quick stun.
[4:30:36] <meganicmp3> hell
[4:30:36] <%Uncle_Christian> "Why did I put those crates there"?
[4:30:36] <+GerryOmega> there goes thousands of dollars of waynetech
[4:30:38] <clack14> mister___doctor or maybe batman just steals wayne tech
[4:30:38] <PanicSwytch> More Skulls
[4:30:41] <AhmCha> Batman pulls hundreds of thousands of dollars in materials to the sea because they were in his way
[4:30:42] <%zeejaymac> The detective vision stays on during sex
[4:30:48] <Doctadaking> This game is very Metroidvania

[4:43:46] <Johannen> Woolie would sacrifice xp gain and more upgrades so he could ignore riddler)
[4:43:49] <Iwashi94> I found the proper riddles pretty fun tbh
[4:43:51] <dukenux> HOWDY DIDLY DOO BATMAN
[4:43:55] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Johannen That speaks volumes
[4:43:56] <Doctadaking> I guarantee that those won‚Äôt be completed on stream, Woolie. Too much backtracking

[4:44:20] <bear_breaker20> riddler sux
[4:44:22] <+coward_man> it was for the time
[4:44:23] <dork_doggler> it was impressive back then
[4:44:23] <velgaduere> I played this on release, it definitely was
[4:44:25] <RealDurdyDan> Oh it was

[4:44:26] <+Nomad_Scholar> It was, you had to be there
[4:44:27] <%SveriSageAdvice> it was for the time
[4:44:31] <+Hick12> This was one of the first PhysX enhanced games.
[4:44:32] <+TheTyper> It was kinda impressive, but more importantly: Everyone thought it was the future.
[4:44:34] <somedude1013> Woolie stop making me feel old
[4:44:38] <+RJay80> does it always gatta be a bwt pattern batman? YES
[4:44:41] <Asuterisuku> 12 years ago. It was pretty impressive back then.
[4:44:41] <%Javaa01> It ran on an X360 *at* a framerate, it was relatively impressive
[4:44:41] <Doctadaking> Arkham City overdid Riddler trophies so hard that Arkham Knight scaled it down
[4:44:44] <%cursedwithadhd> Nah Arkham City was full of stretching gameplay with riddles
[4:44:48] <+Zeromaru2> I gotta go. Thanks for the stream guys good luck
[4:44:50] <+CptBritches> They prob didn't design the game based on how impressive they thought it would be 12 years in the future

[4:47:40] <dukenux> not unless you go for completionist route
[4:47:49] <+TheTyper> That chair tho
[4:47:50] <Doctadaking> The combat and visuals are much improved in later games
[4:47:54] <user_naim> Dated, but still cool
[4:47:56] <super_harley_dude> gg's gents
[4:47:57] <Ashenik1> witcher game maybe? :3
[4:47:58] <%kullumanati> Did Reggie Edge up during the LP? SeemsGood
[4:48:00] <Johannen> I would say it would take around 14-15 hours for you guys
[4:48:06] <meganicmp3> the riddler things and etc really are the bulk of this game
[4:48:08] <Halospaz117> Batman had weird fat lips
[4:48:09] <andre11dr> The art carries it
[4:48:10] <TheWizardOfWordplay> arkham knight makes this game look like mgs2
[4:48:29] <Ashenik1> Sekiro witth Reggie ? :3
[4:48:33] <+Iamdenril> arkham knight is a gorgeous game
[4:48:34] <HighAnkleBoard> @WoolieVersus Yeah it's not long. I have 20 hours in the game and have gotten all achievments.
[4:48:35] <Tracazoid> Arkham City has an opening where Bruce Wayne is reflected in Hugo Stange's glasses, in the remaster I think this is lost entirely
[4:48:37] <velgaduere> you wanna know how fucking exhausting the Riddler shit is? I was 3 trophies short of full completion before the end of the game and just said "fuck it" and ended it
[4:48:37] <%chosenjuan42> chosenjuan42 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! Only on Woolie Vs can we see someone's first impressions of Paper Mario, Halo, Galaxy 2, & now Arkham Asylum. Never change and keep up the great content!
[4:48:38] <Asuterisuku> They made the mistake of zooming in.
[4:48:39] <Halospaz117> @Ashenik1 w/ minh
[4:48:46] <meganicmp3> this game is all about atmosphere
[4:48:47] <+mechslayer71> Is Minh coming back for Sekiro?
[4:48:48] <Doctadaking> Arkham Knight has many problems, but the combat and predator gameplay were 10/10
[4:48:48] <%Dante_Namikaze1> Nightwing is AC looks so bad they ruined him
[4:48:48] <%kyh9> Woolie, did you FEEL like Batman?
[4:48:49] <%Wulfphelz> Shhhh chat no spoilers
[4:48:50] <leomuratore> Arkham City looked great
[4:48:52] <+OUTheTeam> arkham knight is still one of the bedt looking games
[4:48:54] <DrkJP520> I mean, look at any other game from 2009
[4:48:59] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Arkham knight makes this game look like Citizen Kane
[4:49:01] <+DizzyGunner> looks good for a 12 Y/O game
[4:49:06] <Link_Hero_of_Legends> Just hopped in for lunch break, what we talking about?
[4:49:17] <%ShinobiPhoenix> frankly, I am looking forward to Gotham Knights
[4:49:22] <+mechslayer71> @link_hero_of_legends remaster can original for this game
[4:49:23] <peachy996> The Remaster takes more away from City
[4:49:30] <Asuterisuku> Thanks, Warner, fuck you, Warner.
[4:49:35] <$emptyantics> Akham Knight looks wet and great
[4:49:46] <leomuratore> peycey
[4:49:53] <peachy996> But City looks great anyway and a big model improvement from Asylum
[4:49:56] <%ShinobiPhoenix> a PC that doesn't run Arkham Asylum. lol
[4:50:04] <dundore77> That apparently can't play a 2009 game with all the settings enabled
[4:50:04] <+condemned_15> Would you consider playing Arkham VR in the future?
[4:50:05] <Asuterisuku> Knight didn't even need a remaster, it was same generation.
[4:50:08] <%chosenjuan42> But can my custom PC run Arkham Asylum at Max settings?
[4:50:13] <$eco419> SeemsGood
[4:50:14] <Doctadaking> I still maintain that City is better than Asylum, but just barely
[4:50:24] <leomuratore> City is great

[5:00:45] <Link_Hero_of_Legends> Booster Gold went back in time because his pp smol
[5:00:48] <townzzzzz> play system shock
[5:00:51] <leomuratore> Man, I want to play Bioshock Infinite in a current pc. Game looks great
[5:00:52] <chaos2frozen> "You haven't seen death note?!" is still one of my favorite moments lol
[5:00:55] <Sunstalker> It's the best content, Minerva's den
[5:00:59] <%guyalex> if you wanna see some real shit, play infinite for the racism
[5:01:00] <majindusto> Guy Gardner is Awesome
[5:01:00] <Asuterisuku> Minerva's Den is legit.
[5:01:00] <Johannen> Minerva Den is the greatest DLC ever they say
[5:01:03] <moonmintparadise> the remake ?
[5:01:04] <%Chatterbox1991> @WoolieVersus Buriel at Sea is ass and ruins the franchise, you're good
[5:01:07] <andre11dr> Bioshock is cool but i wouldn't return to it
[5:01:07] <wendigo172> @peachy996 ‚Äúhim‚Äù?
[5:01:08] <StarlessAH> Woolie vs System Shock'd be dope
[5:01:09] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I don't like the last Bioshock Infinite DLC
[5:01:12] <DatAsuna> What about the Republic Commando remaster? :P
[5:01:12] <TraitGene2> play clive barker's undying
[5:01:16] <%Wulfphelz> Just watch Batman The Brave and the Bold, that's the best batman to learn about ALL the DC characters LUL
[5:01:19] <+ClericOfSparda> omg
[5:01:22] <%kyh9> It does though
[5:01:22] <meganicmp3> play doom 3
[5:01:23] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @chatterbox1991 YOURE A HERETIC
[5:01:23] <Lancaster_H> yeaaaahhh
[5:01:23] <leomuratore> Another guy
[5:01:25] <notorious_rng> didnt infinite already ruin the franchise
[5:01:26] <%L3m0nTwi5t> Has Reggie ever played Chrono Trigger?
[5:01:26] <Ravioli_Ronin> Aw hell yeah republic commando
[5:01:26] <dabeaminator> Hasn't Systemshock aged kinda poorly? Or at least that's what I've been told.
[5:01:26] <+Deekman> burial at sea was great
[5:01:31] <Sunstalker> Ignore infinite, go check out minerva's den if you want
[5:01:31] <Gates623> Deus ex invisible war
[5:01:36] <Project205> that's too far, but I get it
[5:01:36] <JxsFusion> burial at sea is the best part of infinite
[5:01:37] <Prevot> it really does
[5:01:37] <%Chatterbox1991> Like, non-sensicle levels of retcon
[5:01:41] <%ThatGuyThere03> bideo james
[5:01:42] <GarbageNirvana> I was kinda done with the franchise by the end of Infinite tbh
[5:01:42] <DatAsuna> Burial at Sea buries the franchise at sea
[5:01:45] <Johannen> There is REPUBLIC COMMANDO remake? WUT WHERE?
[5:01:46] <stukamod> Racism: DONE
[5:01:47] <fuji_92> burial is dope who was the one guy
[5:01:48] <andre11dr> System Shock is dope
[5:01:50] <%Javaa01> @WoolieVersus There is a pretty faithful remake of System Shock 1 coming in a couple months, so that's a thing
[5:01:54] <peachy996> @wendigo172 See what I mean? I meant Cluemaster but I care so little I said Spoiler bc that's more memorable
[5:01:55] <prime_name> Infintie has some good shit
[5:01:59] <theredfox930000> we need a wollie versus rap album here we come tougher than the rest of them the best of them
[5:02:02] <Halospaz117> @Johannen re-release rather, on PS4 i believe
[5:02:02] <Ipsenscastle> Everything up to the combat in Infinite was fascinating
[5:02:03] <%kyh9> Burial At Sea REALLY fucks things up bad. Premise has never been enough to make a good piece of media. Execution >>>>>>>>>>>>>> Premise
[5:02:04] <Ravioli_Ronin> Republic commando drops this month or next
[5:02:05] <huskarl_zap> People thinking levine can do more than some dialogue ruined the franchise.
[5:02:10] <dabeaminator> Infinite plays fine.
[5:02:11] <@Moobot> That's a tad too many emotes, @xxsturben13xx (warning)
[5:02:13] <DatAsuna> @Johannen Coming next month to PS4 and switch, courtesy of Aspyr
[5:02:14] <syanplague> Sky Crimes
[5:02:15] <StarlessAH> Columbia is just Zepp tho
[5:02:18] <Asuterisuku> @Javaa01 Made by NightDive, the guys who have been remastering a whole bunch of Boomer Shooters lately.
[5:02:19] <GarbageNirvana> Infinite tries to say a whole lot without really saying anything
[5:02:22] <%ShinobiPhoenix> nope, Burial at Sea is short, and then weird, but the second part of it is terrible
[5:02:32] <+RJay80> i enjoyed inifinite when i first played it
[5:02:33] <Lancaster_H> All it cost is just a minute now, for one dollar you can show me how...
[5:02:34] <%kyh9> Good execution of a bad premise trumps bad execution of a good premise
[5:02:36] <wendigo172> @peachy996 idk she has her fans. They threw a fit once New 52 happened. Protesting at cons etc
[5:02:42] <Ravioli_Ronin> I love the trailers we got for Infinite. The Acadian game? ü§∑‚ôÇÔ∏è
[5:02:52] <rytisone> I dont like endings that require youtube video explanation what happened
[5:02:53] <huskarl_zap> America bad
[5:03:04] <cheap_turbo> dishonored is like that
[5:03:05] <Asuterisuku> Woolie, play what you want to play.
[5:03:06] <andre11dr> Infinite had a lot of cool ideas, but big problems that came packaged with those
[5:03:06] <%Chatterbox1991> @WoolieVersus Colombia as a setting is more interesting than the game
[5:03:10] <%blazingmist> blazingmist subscribed with Prime.
[5:03:12] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I like Bioshock Infinite base game a lot
[5:03:14] <DatAsuna> Remember when actual republicans uironically were reposting the propaganda art from infinite going on about how cool it was?
[5:03:14] <meganicmp3> fallout or whatever
[5:03:18] <%kyh9> GOOD, STAY AWAY REGGIE
[5:03:19] <theredfox930000> it would have been a good movie
[5:03:20] <%thotbane> @DatAsuna oh shit Aspyr still exists? They were/possibly are The Mac Port Guys
[5:03:22] <StarlessAH> I wish Infinite was the game the devs wanted to make, not the game Ken Levine wanted to make
[5:03:28] <GarbageNirvana> Infinite's politics are infuriatingly centrist
[5:03:33] <jorniev> feels bad cause i liked infinite
[5:03:37] <%guyalex> BIG PROBLEMS
[5:03:41] <huskarl_zap> NOW that is a top kek
[5:03:41] <Johannen> Infinite droped the ball like it has never been droped before
[5:03:42] <leomuratore> @garbagenirvana True.
[5:03:46] <wendigo172> Has Woolie played Dishonored before?
[5:03:48] <PanicSwytch> Plot
[5:03:51] <DatAsuna> @LiquidDinosaur Well they also did great ports of jedi outcast/academy and kotor 1/2 to android/switch/ps4
[5:03:51] <$emptyantics> Ken Levine is a mediocre writer
[5:03:52] <fuji_92> infinite is fine, not great, not awesome, it's fine
[5:03:56] <prime_name> Story and themes are really not great
[5:03:56] <horriblegoatdemon> Ken Levine says "Both sides are bad"
[5:03:56] <Lancaster_H> setting is sick, gameplay is downgraded, story is a mess
[5:03:56] <mortificent> Infinite's both sides bullshit is SO BVAD
[5:03:57] <StarlessAH> Dishonored is amazing
[5:03:58] <%paladinstarbuster> people dont like it? I thought it was just the ending
[5:04:02] <dabeaminator> It's mostly the writing, honestly. The gameplay is fine.
[5:04:08] <%kyh9> Infinite's story and gameplay are FUCKED. The world design is cool but not very immersive
[5:04:08] <Doctadaking> Surface level commentary
[5:04:09] <+nomad390> I LOVED Infinite, the remaster is pretty good
[5:04:10] <%Chatterbox1991> Most people like it a lot, sci fi nerds hate cus it's really sot science
[5:04:12] <Prevot> I don't think MOST people hate it, a lot of people eat that shit right up
[5:04:17] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I like the ending ending
[5:04:19] <leomuratore> Ken Levine, the centrist.
[5:04:21] <+PrettyGirlWithaLazyEye> hey chat is the first batman stream? been studying lots so havent tuned in recently
[5:04:22] <tattleworm> "we gotta keep the non-whites down or they'll start eating children" and then they actually do
[5:04:26] <Johannen> Gameplay is not fine, its a basic run and gun shooter without any cool ideas
[5:04:27] <%Irridium> Gameplay was honestly the weakest of the franchise I felt. could just do so much more cool stuff in Bioshock 1 and 2
[5:04:27] <%guyalex> surface? the twist is black people killing children haha
[5:04:29] <meganicmp3> i traded my copy of bioshock on ps3 and i regret it
[5:04:30] <Ravioli_Ronin> Remember when ken Levine said he was going to take a few bioshock devs and start making games, and that was like 5 years ago and nothing happened?
[5:04:34] <Jaysky> SMOTHER.
[5:04:35] <%jinking79> Would you kindly
[5:04:36] <Asuterisuku> Infinite is worth playing.
[5:04:36] <andre11dr> I would say play it ,it's fine
[5:04:45] <PanicSwytch> Its great but the plot is overwhelming
[5:04:47] <%kyh9> "OH MAN, I REALLY LOVE ONLY CARRYING TWO GUNS BUT ALSO HAVING TO UPGRADE INDIVIDUAL GUN TYPES THAT I WONT ALWAYS HAVE AMMO FOR"

[5:05:30] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Riddler is MOST annoying in Knight
[5:05:35] <mrslappyboi2020> definitely worth doing a few for the sake of xp though

[5:06:15] <BaslerJones> YEYEYEYEYE
[5:06:15] <ExpressNode> Thats kind of like me
[5:06:17] <+nabs2099> THATS WHY ITS FUN WOOLIE
[5:06:21] <+Hick12> I liked Riddler in City and Origins the most.
[5:06:22] <Asuterisuku> So about tomorrow's stream!
[5:06:28] <majindusto> WOOLIE'S LATE TO THE PARTY LPs
[5:06:29] <andre11dr> Now time to bring some Dead Space and RE into the fold and were in
[5:06:31] <syanplague> eating a AAA hamburger every now and them
[5:06:35] <DatAsuna> When's WooliveVS Cities SKylines?
[5:06:41] <fuji_92> only fighting games in this household
[5:06:41] <SomersaultJustice> FITE GAEMZ
[5:06:41] <%CptnCampy61> LATE to EVERY party
[5:06:43] <Ravioli_Ronin> I miss dead space so much :(
[5:06:46] <$emptyantics> The Riddler reward in AK is kinda neat
[5:06:47] <BlackermanZX> Reggie plays Dead Space would be GOOD
[5:06:48] <%Jiggisnipe> Woolie likes fighting games and character action
[5:06:53] <StarlessAH> I cant wait for the disco full cut LP
[5:07:01] <meganicmp3> thats where the meat is
[5:07:05] <jorniev> HALO WAS FUN
[5:07:05] <+Deekman> dude Dead Space would be a sick playthrough
[5:07:06] <+samuraiknack> When Woolie vs FIFA?
[5:07:11] <SomersaultJustice> watch woolie play like FF4 or something
[5:07:15] <+Posh_Cat> Halo was a great ride
[5:07:15] <DatAsuna> WoolieVS Madden
[5:07:20] <+Hick12> Woolie VS Dota Anime
[5:07:20] <Ravioli_Ronin> Dead space and republic commando when
[5:07:21] <leomuratore> @samuraiknack This would be incredible. LUL
[5:07:27] <redrins> no but play my game though Kappa
[5:07:28] <dabeaminator> @starlessdan Doesn't Disco Elysium come out this month?
[5:07:29] <+NocturnePsycho> i still go back and rewatch the halo LPs
[5:07:29] <%chosenjuan42> We love that you do it! It's so rare since most people have done them before
[5:07:30] <%ZweihanderSteve> lmao
[5:07:39] <meganicmp3> republic commando would be nice
[5:07:41] <fuji_92> WoolieVS Dragon's Dogma
[5:07:42] <+nabs2099> lol I gave up on most anime in 2015 tbh
[5:07:47] <DatAsuna> You can, but it's boring
[5:07:48] <StarlessAH> @dabeaminator Maybe. It's Estonian artists for devs so who can say
[5:07:50] <andre11dr> Dude i forgot, Woolie never played FF6 LUL
[5:07:53] <ExpressNode> I stopped being a seasonal anime guy. Since there is so much anime out there you can take your time
[5:07:56] <prime_name> Woolie VS Grafiti Kingdom
[5:07:58] <%Jiggisnipe> there will never be a enough time for everything, so consume what you really like
[5:08:03] <%ZweihanderSteve> its so hard to keep up with stuff that you might not like
[5:08:10] <$emptyantics> Woolie Vs. DRAGONS DOGMA WHEN?!
[5:08:14] <+nabs2099> WOOLIE Vs Dragon's Dogma would be amazing
[5:08:37] <BlackermanZX> Man graffiti kingdom was so fun LUL
[5:08:38] <+waltzqueen> BibleThump
[5:08:38] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Woolie vs MORE GOEMON, WHENZ
[5:08:45] <+nabs2099> BUT RE2 LP WAS SO GOOD THO
[5:08:47] <rytisone> When's Claire B tho?
[5:08:47] <Asuterisuku> And that is fine.
[5:08:48] <%L3m0nTwi5t> How about Reggie woolieVS Chrono Trigger woolieGASM
[5:08:50] <andre11dr> I like them
[5:08:51] <Ipsenscastle> I also vote for Woolie VS Dragons Dogma
[5:08:55] <fuji_92> Claire B never
[5:08:55] <majindusto> CLAIRE B NEVER BibleThump
[5:08:59] <%CptnCampy61> Not for me
[5:09:00] <TraitGene2> we need to find woolie a character action survival horror game
[5:09:00] <Tracazoid> Woolie's favourite RE is Umbrella Chronicles Kappa
[5:09:01] <StarlessAH> Real talk, you taught me how to appreciate fighting games and character action games
[5:09:02] <Allen_33> I like your content for playing stuff I never actually play
[5:09:03] <Arkfyre> Woolie vs Metroid Prime
[5:09:03] <+samuraiknack> Woolie vs Rule of Rose
[5:09:03] <Johannen> Fighting games are too much of a niche that requires a lot of time, so its super niche
[5:09:04] <Lancaster_H> ADA WONG THO
[5:09:07] <DatAsuna> WoolieVS Silent Hill Shattered Memories colouring minigame
[5:09:07] <+SolidusRex> WHEN'S CLAIRE B?
[5:09:13] <huskarl_zap> Huge FAns = You better go pick up that brick.
[5:09:24] <%ValentineWolf7> A person with other tastes that aren't mine?!! *GASP*
[5:09:24] <%mundanelotus> RE Remake playthrough confirmed??? lets go
[5:09:25] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Woolie vs Mystical Ninja 64, Top 5 games for N64
[5:09:48] <andre11dr> RE 7 would be a sick LP
[5:09:52] <ExpressNode> Woolie vs Goemon's Great Adventure
[5:09:52] <BlackermanZX> Reggie vs SH2/SH3
[5:10:02] <%krispen_wa> Woolie likes Fighting Games? WHAAA?
[5:10:05] <+taren817> !uptime
[5:10:05] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 5 hours and 20 minutes
[5:10:12] <CoffeeSlice> ReggieVS RE7
[5:10:14] <meganicmp3> woolie vs SiN
[5:10:19] <DatAsuna> I would still like to see Woolie try a Tales game like abyss or vesperia, but they're the most anti-LP games with shittons of missable sidequests
[5:10:21] <Tracazoid> I only started Yakuza in 2019, that was some good shit.
[5:10:23] <%Wulfphelz> I expect you to go through these old games and be a master at them like chat totally was when we went through Kappa
[5:10:24] <%BinaryFireball> man I hate halflife
[5:10:25] <kamenspidey> woolievs getting into survival horror
[5:10:33] <%chosenjuan42> GREAT CONTENT
[5:10:35] <+nabs2099> I want some Minh Vs
[5:10:40] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Mystical Ninja 64 would legit be easy and enjoyable, vs Goemon's Great Adventure would be EVEN MORE frustrating than Legend of the Mystical Ninja
[5:10:42] <andre11dr> I don't think Woolie would like Silent Hill
[5:10:43] <alfredfromthedusk> I wanna see Woolie do a full run of Metal Gear with someone who didn't play it
[5:10:50] <%ZweihanderSteve> yuhyuhyuh halo is alright woolieMIRIN
[5:10:53] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @meganicmp3
[5:10:54] <jorniev> DOOM THO

[5:11:36] <meganicmp3> aaron cash
[5:11:39] <TraitGene2> and then he did it 3 more times
[5:11:41] <Doctadaking> He said that after every game I think
[5:11:42] <leomuratore> It wasn't, was it?
[5:11:42] <SheefEatsBeef> Thugz Munny
[5:11:46] <dabeaminator> Boy that didn't happen
[5:11:48] <Asuterisuku> He said that and then went to do the rest of the Trilogy.
[5:11:49] <+NocturnePsycho> it isnt tho lmao
[5:11:50] <HollowMan190> he kert going
[5:11:50] <prime_name> Then he came back
[5:11:50] <%wibbwobbler> LUL
[5:11:50] <Wild_Samurai> dude Mark says that EVERY project
[5:11:50] <peachy996> And then he kept coming back
[5:11:51] <fuji_92> he said but he kept doing it
[5:11:51] <mighty_fine_trousers> Thought it was City due to reasons?
[5:11:51] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[5:11:52] <%Jiggisnipe> and then he lied?
[5:11:52] <+puma_sama> don't forget that this game makes you FEEL like Batman
[5:11:52] <rytisone> not for Origins
[5:11:54] <%Dante_Namikaze1> No it was Arkham City
[5:11:57] <%krispen_wa> [TELL ME LIES]
[5:11:58] <+GenesisKnight> That was a lie LUL
[5:11:59] <%ShinobiPhoenix> but then MONEY
[5:12:02] <NoireRequiem> We brought him back in
[5:12:03] <PanicSwytch> He said it every time but money talks
[5:12:04] <andre11dr> And he did it for Injustice too
[5:12:04] <+samuraiknack> He says that everytime
[5:12:05] <kamenspidey> aren't the sequels troy baker?
[5:12:08] <+loukemia83> mans gotta eat
[5:12:08] <bear_breaker20> mark loves the role too much
[5:12:12] <YVESSAINTMORON_> Tell me sweet little lies
[5:12:12] <joshua_42> THAT WAS A FUCKING LIE
[5:12:13] <meganicmp3> troy baker is origins
[5:12:17] <leomuratore> @kamenspidey Arkham Origins
[5:12:19] <Asuterisuku> Troy Baker did him in Origins.
[5:12:19] <%heartlesshealer> I love that the world acknowledges him as Best Joker
[5:12:20] <Ravioli_Ronin> ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not gonna do my money maker voice‚Äù
[5:12:22] <Lancaster_H> hes having too much fun in that studio to drop it
[5:12:25] <peachy996> Origins is Troy Baker, Injustice is Raiden's VA
[5:12:30] <dabeaminator> @kamenspidey He may have only done Arkham Origins
[5:12:34] <Halospaz117> He kills it, much like the citizens of Gotham
[5:12:37] <+TunakIn> all of them except origins with troy baker
[5:12:39] <%Seancicle> gonna bounce. cul8tr
[5:12:40] <+Posh_Cat> Troy baker did a pretty imitation
[5:12:40] <NoireRequiem> anyone see him as the trickster on cw?
[5:12:42] <TheCrispyBoi> jack
[5:12:44] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Who is joker in MK?

[5:12:54] <+nabs2099> Reggie Vs Pokemon Shining Diamond Nuzlocke when
[5:12:55] <+evbites> i hate baker as joker
[5:12:55] <jowi_time> if the arkham games were his last time as joker, im good with that. They are a great send off
[5:12:59] <DomonTrigger> PRESIDES
[5:13:00] <PanicSwytch> Troy Baker did a good job with the joker VA
[5:13:05] <andre11dr> Wasn't Injustice 2 Mark? Im pretty sure it was
[5:13:05] <%paladinstarbuster> I love leto's joker because of BOTTOM TEXT
[5:13:07] <+YaBish311> So happy to see you jumping into one of my favorite series. Hamill is the GOAT
