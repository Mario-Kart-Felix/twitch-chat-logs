[0:02:34] <Labandero_X> don't worry woolie, promise nothing and deliver less :v
[0:02:40] <+Toynota10> Woolie. We promise to unsub from Super Bunny Hop if it happens again
[0:02:53] <JohnOsborn> skull f*cked
[0:03:14] <FleshFriend> barria 'd
[0:03:34] <%UnderpaidBob> This game is by far the greatest April Fools joke I've ever seen
[0:03:35] <Mordexai0> Hayate is basically the Hayato of this game?
[0:03:53] <+Answer_Moose> I remember playing D. Dark a lot in Street Fighter EX Plus Alpha
[0:03:56] <+professor_rocket> i remember playing this on launch, it was so rough
[0:04:09] <FleshFriend> tomayate tomayato
[0:04:26] <+Answer_Moose> @WoolieVersus lets see some Garuda!
[0:04:29] <Mordexai0> Have they touched D Dark yet?
[0:05:02] <+Answer_Moose> no
[0:05:05] <Mordexai0> @professor_rocket I know the Beta was rough but they fixed it a lot
[0:05:14] <+VektorTroika> garuda is STRONGER
[0:05:16] <KeiPrime> blair
[0:05:20] <+Answer_Moose> YEAH GARUDA
[0:05:42] <Mordexai0> I love Kairi. I will support him til the day I die

[0:07:28] <+Floofiie> multitwitch.tv/AngriestPat/woolieversus
[0:07:28] <KeiPrime> direct input controllers
[0:07:31] <Guntanks_in_Space> "switching inputs"
[0:07:46] <Guntanks_in_Space> i think it's steam's controller support being borked as usual
[0:08:04] <Guntanks_in_Space> the big picture control support thing. same thing seemed to happen to neo aquarium last stream iirc
[0:08:08] <+VektorTroika> how the heck do Japanese devs code video games if their ports make it look like they've never used a pc before?
[0:08:11] <$wolf34736> cheer1 cheer1
[0:08:27] <haitakaa> go faster woolie but take your time Kappa
[0:08:45] <+VektorTroika> lol yeah steam controller support sure doesn't help
[0:08:47] <KeiPrime> a lot of the good ports are done by different devs
[0:08:52] <stormhawk9891> Jesus that damage
[0:09:00] <KeiPrime> QLOC does like almost all the capcom ports that are really good
[0:09:01] <%linkwolf4> lytGULP
[0:09:07] <KeiPrime> like all the REs
[0:09:33] <+ssulcer> lytGULP lytGULP lytGULP
[0:09:46] <Guntanks_in_Space> yeah, QLOC ports are really good. i still credit them for having the first actually playable 60FPS DmC on PC, and saving MKX from High Voltage's big fumble lol
[0:10:25] <+VektorTroika> High Voltage made one, solitary, Good Game: Lego Racers
[0:10:50] <KeiPrime> after the ZoE hd shit, how anyone could trust high voltage
[0:10:52] <KeiPrime> beyond me
[0:10:55] <%GingaNZ> woolieGASM
[0:11:15] <KeiPrime> i did like the hunter games tho on the original xbox
[0:11:21] <jumbomanlive> Hey guys and Woolz
[0:11:46] <+Floofiie> What's wrong with the ZoE HD stuff? I grabbed it free for psplus
[0:11:49] <+VektorTroika> hunter games?
[0:12:03] <KeiPrime> oh PS version is fine NOW, but the original release was not ideal
[0:12:05] <UrsulaCat> don't drop your combos. half-girls are watching
[0:12:05] <RetroCop87> so despite these guys mostly being original characters to a Street Fighter game, this technically has nothing to do with Street Fighter?
[0:12:12] <KeiPrime> hunter the reckoning
[0:12:18] <+VektorTroika> Ah
[0:12:27] <+VektorTroika> WoD stuff
[0:12:32] <KeiPrime> they were liek gauntlet style games base don the white wolf pen an paper
[0:12:33] <QuincyPwns> @Retrocop87 the creator is the lead dev of sf2
[0:12:39] <QuincyPwns> was*
[0:12:42] <+VektorTroika> nice
[0:12:46] <Mordexai0> @vektortroika I can't get made at Arika since they only have like 10 people on staff & their budget is like a paperclip & string
[0:12:47] <RetroCop87> ah
[0:12:54] <@SoushinSen> oh hey @KeiPrime
[0:12:59] <QuincyPwns> but it is its own franchise
[0:13:01] <Mordexai0> mad*
[0:13:21] <QuincyPwns> a spiritual successor to both the sf EX series and fighting layer
[0:13:26] <KeiPrime> sup @SoushinSen
[0:13:37] <Mordexai0> Like this game is SUPER Budgeted
[0:13:37] <+JacktheMan18> Man I need to get this on PC so i can play more. Shirase is so much fun
[0:13:43] <Guntanks_in_Space> yeah i can't really fault arika that hard, at least they respond and recognize stuff in FEXL when they catch it
[0:13:50] <+VektorTroika> @RJroy0 fair enough. my rage is directed more towards street fighter, what with the games for windows port and whatever the heck is going on in SFV
[0:14:07] <TungstenViper> Arika really needs to put Fughting Layer characters in this game
[0:14:23] <+ChansonNoire> yo games for windows SFIV
[0:14:26] <QuincyPwns> i agree
[0:14:32] <KeiPrime> push janis for FEXL
[0:14:32] <+ChansonNoire> that shit was sick
[0:14:40] <+VektorTroika> only problem with Games for Windows SFIV was Games for Windows
[0:14:53] <Running_Sets> Has Woolz and crew touched SF4 yet?
[0:14:56] <QuincyPwns> if htis game is super budgeted it scares me how much was put into SFV
[0:15:01] <+ChansonNoire> gfwl actually the most well optimized version of sfiv on pc lol
[0:15:05] <Mordexai0> @keiprime I mean, we only have who left of the EX cast? Ace & the Cycloids?
[0:15:28] <+JacktheMan18> This game had a lot of love put into it, so they made the budget work imo
[0:16:15] <+VariantX7> I still hope in the future we can get some fighting layer characters in a sequel or DLC for this game
[0:16:18] <Guntanks_in_Space> yeah SFIV PC ran like MAGIC the way DMC4 vanilla ran on toasters
[0:16:25] <QuincyPwns> allens hurtbox falls out of htat combo ALL the time
[0:16:32] <QuincyPwns> its very odd
[0:16:35] <Guntanks_in_Space> QLOC doing SSF4 wasn't quite as good but they got better at it around SFXT onward
[0:16:39] <seylumiue> @Dualities pretty sure not yet
[0:16:41] <Mordexai0> I wonder how they're gonna implement Ace & the Cycloids now that I think about it
[0:16:49] <QuincyPwns> he has a bitch hurtbox
[0:16:58] <KeiPrime> @RJroy0 i forgot if sharon got confirmed with area and terry
[0:17:00] <haitakaa> so it's an Allen thing
[0:17:01] <Running_Sets> I've added 'body Woolie at SF4' to my bucket list
[0:17:06] <QuincyPwns> sharon is confirmed
[0:17:10] <QuincyPwns> probly the next char
[0:17:19] <koomikss> I have a casual lobby set up if anyone wants to play a few sets
[0:17:22] <+JohnXuandou> some moves have a juggle window, if they don't hit the person quick enough they don't juggle, Garuda Psycho Crusher is like that
[0:17:22] <koomikss> ps4
[0:17:52] <Mordexai0> @variantx7 They said they'd get to them after the EX cast. But we have to keep supporting it in order for it thrive.
[0:18:32] <+VariantX7> @RJroy0 they just have to make stuff for me to buy
[0:18:37] <+primax104> I haven't seen this stage before

[0:28:57] <+JohnXuandou> so like, the translator of the game, Jiyuna, he's from New York, and when they were making the game they kept asking him if it was accurate, and he told them "Yeah it looks great. Make it filthy. Put trash everywhere."
[0:29:27] <Dat_Guy_SLaTeR> @johnxuandou this looks like brooklynn

[0:40:54] <HanPaul> notekBust
[0:40:59] <%Atomic_ColliderSG> its all about karnov's revenge
[0:41:04] <+pr0at> the best thing about fightcade is windjammers and money puzzle exchange
[0:41:15] <KeiPrime> oh shiiit

[0:43:16] <%linkwolf4> @QuincyPwns exactly, its perfect lytCRAZY
[0:43:17] <%secretspud> blocking is for cowards
[0:43:21] <KeiPrime> ya know blocking is part of the game but sometimes you dont want to
[0:43:27] <Guntanks_in_Space> closest we got is Hiroshi Tanahashi
[0:43:32] <seylumiue> no blocks with aggro GOUGI
[0:43:35] <eddy_bam> one more time for the ppl in the back
[0:43:37] <Guntanks_in_Space> but he was also GARO though
[0:43:38] <%Tbnero> block with your face
[0:43:40] <eddy_bam> FEXL discord https://discord.gg/6whZRG
[0:43:43] <+JohnXuandou> well to be fair with Strider/Doom, even if you get hit you're still boned
[0:43:58] <TungstenViper> doesn't S.Geist have a air stomp?
[0:44:04] <+JohnXuandou> yeah
[0:44:07] <+TheKnightMask> yes

[0:46:39] <+JohnXuandou> she's got a float too
[0:46:44] <+VektorTroika> shantae colors
[0:46:52] <Guntanks_in_Space> practically a double jump
[0:47:03] <Guntanks_in_Space> though the pullum here is less oppressive than the one i fought long ago
[0:47:05] <+JohnXuandou> she has a double jump and a float
[0:47:35] <+JohnXuandou> one of her air normals she can double jump cancel too
[0:47:58] <+JohnXuandou> anti airs in this game are pretty bad
[0:48:03] <+JohnXuandou> they've tried to address it twice
[0:48:07] <KeiPrime> yeah one of her combo challenges is just staying in the air for an obscene amount of time
[0:48:16] <Guntanks_in_Space> 20 seconds i think
[0:48:21] <Guntanks_in_Space> or was it 10
[0:48:35] <KeiPrime> some DMC enemy step level of itme
[0:48:50] <%dOjOTron> dang i've been sleeping on this game
