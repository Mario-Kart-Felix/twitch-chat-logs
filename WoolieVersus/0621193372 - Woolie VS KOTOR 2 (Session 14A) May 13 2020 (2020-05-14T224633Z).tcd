[0:07:32] <%doomerskeletor13> @datasuna “Maybe we should just kiss”
[0:07:43] <%DatAsuna> I'd kiss sheev
[0:07:47] <%ggbhtg> AKA, Pat spends a whole hour in his mind prison which would be solved by saying "The difference between this and DMC2 is the severity of the event, not when it happened"
[0:07:52] <%CommanderSqueaks> Remember that, Vader is Anakin NERFED.
[0:08:12] <%FuqBoiSlim> You think Palpatine would be a good kisser?
[0:08:28] <%doomerskeletor13> Woolie you should read the Gilles comic too, takes place after A New Hope
[0:08:30] <%FuqBoiSlim> hes probably kinda lazy tbh :Z
[0:08:31] <%xcompleasedad> @FuqBoiSlim He would be *shockingly* good
[0:08:37] <%OldManDeckardCain> vader is berfed anakin, remember that pain and suffering powers up sith
[0:08:40] <%BallerSwagBro9k> PLAY FALLEN ORDER WOOLIE
[0:08:50] <+aishman> @WoolieVersus The best thing about new canon, out of everything, is the Vader comics and Dr. Aphra.
[0:08:53] <%FuqBoiSlim> @xcompleasedad oh you
[0:08:55] <vulkan_vibes> *akihiko voice* I've been waiting for THIS.
[0:08:56] <%krispen_wa> They're Atton Rand
[0:08:58] <%DatAsuna> Have you seen the concept video for cut order 66 kills? There's droid head rips and air combos on ejector seats. It's real silly.
[0:09:01] <%doomerskeletor13> Woolie you should play Fallen Order at some point
[0:09:15] <+doc_ock_rokc> Some of it is good (and MOSTLY because they ripped that off of Legends) some of it is Bad
[0:09:22] <+mars_driver> @WoolieVersus I know it isn't Star Wars, but the recent Power Rangers comics are legitimately good, too.
[0:09:36] <%tearfuldevil> wooolie, there's no "rakghoul thing"?
[0:09:43] <%tearfuldevil> i'm not sure what you're talking about
[0:09:44] <+MidnightBurst12> kinrath, not rakghouls
[0:09:45] <%Solidnick18> i feel you v
[0:09:49] <silver__viii> I love how as woolie dove deeper into Naruto he became more and more disillusioned, but as he dives deeper into the rabbit hole that is Star Wars EU he's beaming with happiness
[0:09:49] <%GeneralSCPatton> KINRATH
[0:09:49] <%ChoculaUltra> from what I'm gathering, a non-maimed, no breath suit Vader/Anakin would've basically been Uchiha Madara levels of broken?
[0:09:53] <%CommanderSqueaks> r/MetalAsFuck
[0:09:55] <%optimasmaximas> you should look into kylo ren's kyber crystal LUL
[0:09:55] <%tearfuldevil> oh kinrath
[0:10:02] <%tearfuldevil> woolie that wasn't a lore thing
[0:10:05] <%doomerskeletor13> Well they set up in Clone Wars that crystals react to the force user so it makes sense
[0:10:09] <vulkan_vibes> we bleed minerals. Crystals bleed minerals. Therefore, we are kyber crystals
[0:10:10] <Enemy_In_Disguise> Ow the edge
[0:10:19] <SunjammerIV> so glad they turned red lightsabers from synthetic focusing lenses into MOOD CRYSTALS
[0:10:23] <Prevot> @ChoculaUltra what kind of uchiha madara are we talking about here?
[0:10:24] <%kekkerscrew> V and Wools. Since the Light Side was never a thing in the original Trillogy what were your thoughts about how it got put into canon from the games.

[0:10:29] <+MidnightBurst12> in legends, the red crystals were synthetic
[0:10:35] <%jiggy_snipe> V's a cool guy
[0:10:35] <%tearfuldevil> but even then it wasn't like, a lore explanation on how you get crystals, that was just a gamepaly thing
[0:10:35] <%krispen_wa> KILL THE BABIES
[0:10:40] <JetpackMcQuack> kinamaRee get it right
[0:10:48] <%ChoculaUltra> @Prevot I wanna say somewhere between 6 Paths Madara and Undead Madara
[0:10:58] <+doc_ock_rokc> still stupid
[0:10:58] <%tearfuldevil> the lore explanation was, as other people are saying, that red crystals were synthetic, amde by Sith alchemy shit

[0:12:01] <%ChoculaUltra> "yeah that jedi stuff is alright, but have you taken a hit of this hatred?!"
[0:12:02] <+doc_ock_rokc> In legends most red crystals are syntetic and are stronger the natural crystals at least in some aspects
[0:12:06] <lotharrio> I like the one with the Vader fangirl, when she sees his face and he just looks annoyed/bored at everything happening.
[0:12:06] <%doomerskeletor13> That was a good panel
[0:12:12] <%FuqBoiSlim> Hatred is Based tbh
[0:12:25] <%tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus the lore explanation was never "you need to kill kinrath to get red crystals" because that was just a weird gameplay convenience of kotor 1, to let you get a red crystal on Dantooine
[0:12:32] <%optimasmaximas> kratos (pre-norse setting) woulda been a sick sith

[0:14:47] <+doc_ock_rokc> TECHNICALLY all blasters are like that...in Disney EU
[0:14:48] <%CommanderSqueaks> Burns the whole meter.
[0:14:54] <%optimasmaximas> @ggbhtg i meant like which game lol, shoulda been specific, i searched it on yt and didnt get see anything like an OST rip
[0:14:58] <%Javaa01> So it's a Plasma Pistol
[0:14:58] <%Will9099> woolieGASM
[0:14:58] <%JeromeMci> I've got to respect that idea
[0:15:04] <%ggbhtg> @optimasmaximas the anime
[0:15:05] <%tearfuldevil> ugh the lightspeed crash
[0:15:06] <%Theycallmenerf> HAVE YOU SEEN THE PS5 TECH DEMO?
[0:15:06] <@chesterr01> @optimasmaximas f zero anime
[0:15:17] <%tearfuldevil> i liked TLJ, but fuck that stupid lightspeed crash
[0:15:25] <%derap41> 1uptime
[0:15:31] <Redblood801> I wonder if the lightsaber still functions after one shot
[0:15:31] <%derap41> !uptime
[0:15:31] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 33 minutes and 32 seconds
[0:15:33] <jorniev> load lightsabers into a sawed of shot gun
[0:15:35] <%ChoculaUltra> @tearknack yeah...prequel Jedi Order are basically rent-a-cops with a chip on their shoulder. They kinda had that L coming.
[0:15:36] <%doomerskeletor13> RIP Jocasta Nu
[0:15:37] <Prevot> every jedi gets two
[0:15:37] <%optimasmaximas> @ggbhtg @chesterr01 thanks
[0:15:42] <%PR0swagonist> but I like the lightspeed crash
[0:15:44] <+doc_ock_rokc> @WoolieVersus There IS STILL no reason not to use Hyperspace Kamikaze with Astroid dumb missles
[0:16:01] <%Theycallmenerf> Imagine Grevious with that lightsaber gun
[0:16:08] <TheAceol> That makes so much sense holy shit
[0:16:13] <%jiggy_snipe> oh that's really cool
[0:16:18] <%krispen_wa> why doesn't vader have a chainsaw prosthetic?
[0:16:18] <%optimasmaximas> ahsoka is probably the only person to give him the most battle damage @WoolieVersus
[0:16:22] <%tearfuldevil> @ChoculaUltra the PT jsut kind of dropped any of the samurai/monk/cowboy angle, beside them having a temple, and I hate it
[0:16:32] <JetpackMcQuack> Repair: 95
[0:16:36] <%BallerSwagBro9k> PLAY IT
[0:16:36] <%Solidnick18> you should
[0:16:37] <+doc_ock_rokc> the Hyperspace kamikaze was cool. but its comes at such a high price of Fing up all the lore in starwars.
[0:16:41] <%Irridium> 2nd sister hot
[0:16:41] <%masterpiecejeremy> LP FALLEN ORDER WOOLIE
[0:16:43] <%DianaTheAscian> whats this comic called?
[0:16:44] <RamenRiderZ> We need weaponized lightspeed fighter ships, JAVELIN FIGHTERS
[0:16:57] <vulkan_vibes> I need to read these comics.
[0:16:58] <%doomerskeletor13> V have you read the Vader comic that takes place after A New Hope? It’s really great too
[0:16:58] <Jaku2011> Fallen Order LP confirmed
[0:17:05] <%ChoculaUltra> y'all remember that Greatsword Lightsaber from Dark Forces 2? Now that shit was fucking rad.
[0:17:11] <%masterpiecejeremy> Make self piloted fighters designed to lightspeed through shit
[0:17:17] <+doc_ock_rokc> @RamenRiderZ Grab a few droids and junk ships point them in a direction and do some "Force is great" at a planet
[0:17:28] <%tearfuldevil> @doc_ock_rokc yeah, thats my thoughts.. why did every capital ship on the verge of being destroyed not just do that?
[0:17:28] <jorniev> I'm imagining doom Slayer loading lightsabers into his super shotgun
[0:17:28] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:17:32] <%xcompleasedad> THE BEST LINES
[0:17:33] <%optimasmaximas> @Diana869 probably a dark horse vader comic or the marvel ones? sorry, i know it isnt much help but hopefully it helps point you in the right direction
[0:17:37] <%tearfuldevil> they dissolve the senate in ANH
[0:17:40] <vulkan_vibes> yeahhh
[0:17:43] <%xcompleasedad> I FUCKING LOVE THIS BIT IN THE OG
[0:17:52] <%derap41> ...This is to close to reality
[0:17:52] <%xcompleasedad> IT'S THE BEST WORLD-BUILDING
[0:17:54] <vulkan_vibes> right at 0 ABY
[0:18:05] <+doc_ock_rokc> @tearknack Why build ANYTHING larger then a fighter in that instance. as it just makes a bigger target for the HK
[0:18:07] <notenoughgirls> tarkin announces that the senate was dissolved in the death star meeting where vader chokes a dude
[0:18:09] <%doomerskeletor13> Cause they thought the Death Star would give them total power
[0:18:15] <%DianaTheAscian> @optimasmaximas k thx anyway
[0:18:16] <%tearfuldevil> the average person, by the period of the OT, barely knows about the senate
[0:18:22] <%JeromeMci> The best thing side content can do is fill in the smaller details that the main thing dosen't have time for,
[0:18:38] <%ggbhtg> For those of you like me trying to find the Lightsaber beam, look for "Lightsaber rifle" on Wookieepedia
[0:18:49] <vulkan_vibes> it's amazing in star wars how quickly long lived species forget the past.
[0:18:50] <%optimasmaximas> last 4 episodes obliterate the first 8
[0:18:52] <%doomerskeletor13> Clone Wars just had an amazing ending
[0:18:56] <%ChoculaUltra> there's also a lightsaber pistol!
[0:18:57] <%tearfuldevil> if by "the average person" you mean randos like Luke, from Outer Rim planets
[0:18:58] <+SolidusRex> Bad Batch is good though V
[0:19:04] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> the bad batch is for ppl who watch the whole show
[0:19:04] <+doc_ock_rokc> @JeromeMci yes but the issue is when the writers of this side content want to overide main content
[0:19:07] <jorniev> the fact that they meet tarkin in clone wars annoys me
[0:19:10] <%optimasmaximas> the final shot of clone wars was poetic and beautiful
[0:19:17] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LIL ACK
[0:19:20] <%doomerskeletor13> @jorniev ??? Why
[0:19:31] <%ChoculaUltra> tf, is Tarkin like a child in Clone Wars?
[0:19:38] <%joe_bagadou_nautz> has anyone made a clone wars Kai?
[0:19:43] <+doc_ock_rokc> NOPE we can't because KOTOR is no longer cannon
[0:19:44] <%optimasmaximas> @ChoculaUltra nah, he's like 30 or 40
[0:19:46] <%doomerskeletor13> No Tarkin is an adult in the Clone Wars
[0:19:58] <notenoughgirls> second s7 arc mostly serves to show how ahsoka is coping with [redacted]
[0:20:00] <%doomerskeletor13> There’s only 19 years between the clone wars and A New Hope
[0:20:09] <%ggbhtg> Just like there are multiple "Clone Wars" LUL
[0:20:12] <%optimasmaximas> @ChoculaUltra anakin and him meet, which means it's the first time they met before vader and tarkin "met"
[0:20:14] <Jaku2011> If I get the wrong one is it trash?
[0:20:16] <%tearfuldevil> @ChoculaUltra he shouldn't be? in the OT he was like 50s or 60s, and the OT is like 20 or so years later
[0:20:20] <+doc_ock_rokc> @lewdskeletor13 that still is a large chunk of change
[0:20:23] <%JustYudha> But the Vader comics don't count so it doesn't matter lmfao
[0:20:27] <%PR0swagonist> but the prequels ruined vader so whats even the point anymore wooliePOYO
[0:20:37] <%ChoculaUltra> I thought the dude was in his 50s! Looking good for a 60ish dude?
[0:20:37] <%ggbhtg> But your NOT a Star Wars poser, so....
[0:20:38] <Redblood801> Little V is a poser confirmed
[0:20:39] <+ntfth> Have they started playing the game, or have they just been talking a bit so far?
[0:20:41] <%ggbhtg> *you're
[0:20:45] <%doomerskeletor13> The 2015 Vader comic is absolutely worth reading
[0:20:47] <bleugh> comics DansGame
[0:20:48] <SunjammerIV> if you want kotor 2 sophistication in star wars writing check out the darth plagueis novel by james luceno
[0:20:53] <+Taglog7> A Canadian that didn't read Scott Pilgrim?!
[0:20:54] <%tearfuldevil> I've read a bunch of random omnibuses over the eyars for superhero shit, and I've read basically all SW comcis ever
[0:20:58] <jorniev> are you gonna read old republic woolie?
[0:21:01] <%optimasmaximas> @tearknack he's like 30 or 40, in the arc he's in he mentions trying to secure a much larger role/position within the emperor's circle
[0:21:12] <%doomerskeletor13> @doc_ock_rokc Yeah I’m saying that it’s only 19 years so Tarkin would not be a child in the Clone Wars
[0:21:15] <donstylo> Which Comic was Vader going to a Droid planet and killt millions of Droids only with his Lightsaber?
[0:21:16] <+doc_ock_rokc> If you want something fun look at thrawn series woolie
[0:21:20] <Jaku2011> Oh god that discussion was rough
[0:21:22] <astro_yojimbo> Could you name the artist and writer, it helps to find the right run.
[0:21:25] <+doc_ock_rokc> @lewdskeletor13 ah got ya
[0:21:32] <+DesertPenguin> But you're wrong tho lol jk
[0:21:36] <%doomerskeletor13> Charles Soule is a very talented writer. And a lawyer!
[0:21:47] <%Solidnick18> yes
[0:21:52] <+Cerberus_NV> Charles Soule is great.
[0:21:56] <lotharrio> Just like how Bethesda invented first person shooters, right?
[0:22:01] <%BallerSwagBro9k> HOPEFULLY
[0:22:02] <+doc_ock_rokc> @WoolieVersus That requires them not hiring idiots that support KK
[0:22:04] <Jaku2011> Can't wait for the Disney original trilogy Remakes
[0:22:05] <ergothgaming> Did you see REYS LIGHTSABER?
[0:22:05] <+captain_history> The new Thrawn books are also pretty decent
[0:22:08] <+DesertPenguin> God damnit V how many times have you done a Frank Zappa halloween costume?
[0:22:16] <ergothgaming> It was only ever REYS LIGHTSABER
[0:22:16] <RamenRiderZ> I read a shitton of Tex Willer during my conscription
[0:22:16] <+ntfth> Have they started on Kotor before this, or has it been a discussion so far?
[0:22:17] <%tearfuldevil> @doc_ock_rokc KK?
[0:22:19] <SuperChumps> @WoolieVersus but what about the wonder that is SWTOR?
[0:22:20] <%ggbhtg> Considering how much of a dumpster fire the prequels are, Pat wasn't wrong to feel that way. He just had terrible reasoning after the fact.
[0:22:24] <%tearfuldevil> copyright should last 20 years AFTER PUBLICATION, fuck the Mouse
[0:22:25] <Doodle_Taco> It's unbelievable how much one good wruter makes a difference
[0:22:28] <+doc_ock_rokc> Kathline Kennedy
[0:22:42] <Redblood801> Greedo always said Maclunkey

[0:23:16] <+doc_ock_rokc> Unfortunately new writers of the High republich don't think world building is important
[0:23:18] <%ChoculaUltra> zucko instead of zuko LUL
[0:23:18] <damienlunas> When I hear "Avatar" and "Movie" I think of James Cameron
[0:23:20] <bleugh> i like korra because of muscle girl
[0:23:22] <%NormalGuy> yeah how do you fuck it up when the original medium was voiced
[0:23:22] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> it was worse than the dragon Ball E movie

[0:23:29] <%tearfuldevil> i just don't like mmos?
[0:23:38] <%tearfuldevil> i don't like mmo tab combat

[0:23:44] <vulkan_vibes> I want the zucc
[0:23:46] <+HollowMan190> Same....
[0:23:47] <%JeromeMci> There was a time when that as a fan the movie would be all that others would remember and never watch the series. Bad times
[0:23:49] <TheAceol> It doesn't even need to be an MMO
[0:23:55] <%Bluemanzee> Yeah I can't get into MMOs
[0:23:57] <vulkan_vibes> OH NO. Zuko made Facebook.
[0:23:59] <%krispen_wa> AGENT BOIS
[0:23:59] <Redblood801> Jedi Knight is the worst one
[0:24:00] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Swtor turns me off, because of the combat, and as the story goes on it gets worse and worse!
[0:24:02] <SunjammerIV> the reason swtor is bad is because the writing is bad
[0:24:03] <%ChoculaUltra> Sith Warrior story was p friggin sick imo.
[0:24:04] <%jillpilled> only MMO I can stand is FF14 and that's not an atypical one
[0:24:09] <%DatAsuna> It's a lot of different factors for people.
[0:24:10] <AlexStAdams> yo did the stream just START or END
[0:24:12] <silver__viii> SWOTOR I feel like is more fun to think about than it is to actually play. The writing is interesting and Light Side Sith is sick af but holy shit i just don't enjoy playing the opening grind
[0:24:13] <+aishman> @WoolieVersus I'm someone who is into MMOs and I didn't like it. The problem was it was too solo-RPG for the MMO players and too MMO for the solo-RPG players.
[0:24:16] <%DatAsuna> That's a ket one for sure
[0:24:21] <gruulmagebeast> osrs is a fun mmo
[0:24:22] <jorniev> dialogue wheel annoys me
[0:24:32] <%ChoculaUltra> a lot of people say the Jedi Knight class story is KOTOR3 but pff, who wants to play a Jedi amirite?
[0:24:32] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[0:24:37] <%tearfuldevil> @spiritofmojave i tired ff14, it was jsut as baland story wise and stale combat wise as every other MMO, at least to me
[0:24:39] <%DatAsuna> @silver__viii There's no grind anymore most people are level 50 by like the end of chapter 1 lol
[0:24:41] <notenoughgirls> i can barely look at swtor's graphics
[0:24:42] <Klefth> MMOs used to be a bit more unique and sometimes had interesting combat mechanics. And then they all had to start trying to be WoW
[0:25:04] <%vorpalswordable> vorpalswordable subscribed at Tier 1.
[0:25:08] <+doc_ock_rokc> @ChoculaUltra did you hear the rumor that amy henning is wanting to do Kotor3?

[0:25:16] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> mills looks like Jesus
[0:25:17] <Enemy_In_Disguise> Sith Inquisitor is my personal favorite because of how comically evil you could be.
[0:25:18] <TheAceol> @WoolieVersus Yes please sweat
[0:25:18] <OverlordLuna> WutFace
[0:25:18] <%Solidnick18> Sure
[0:25:18] <%jillpilled> @tearknack yeah the time-sink to get to the meaningful writing/developent means it comes REAL late, and I totally get that with the base game stuff
[0:25:27] <RamenRiderZ> FFXIV low level combat is stale
[0:25:28] <gruulmagebeast> Little V whats your favorite lightsaber setup
[0:25:29] <%ChoculaUltra> @doc_ock_rokc don't give me that. That, that HOPE.
[0:25:37] <%tearfuldevil> @DatAsuna its less "you need to grind" and more "the combat inherently feels like a grind, every single fight"
[0:25:41] <jorniev> V you lie katamari?
[0:25:48] <%tearfuldevil> yes
[0:25:49] <jorniev> like
[0:25:52] <%krispen_wa> kyle katarn
[0:25:54] <grandark_z317> Mista Guido?
[0:25:58] <+Taglog7> "limited"
[0:26:03] <+HollowMan190> has to be one
[0:26:06] <+ntfth> Yes there has been, In the Coruscant Knights seris I beleive, a Twi'lek from a Jedi adjacent Force order but not the order itself.
[0:26:07] <+doc_ock_rokc> @ChoculaUltra ah hope. the sweetest of poisions. the only thing people would willingly take knowing full well what it is...
[0:26:09] <%wunp_fxs> the only blaster shot that comes to mind is in the first drath bane novel...
[0:26:12] <+Ward_Walker> Fun fact, before GTA V, SWTOR was the most expensive video game ever made; and half of it's budget was marketing.

[0:28:49] <Redblood801> At least 2
[0:28:54] <%DatAsuna> it's hilarious
[0:29:01] <Enemy_In_Disguise> 3 times?
[0:29:05] <%DatAsuna> "what is it skywalker?" BZZZZM
[0:29:11] <%optimasmaximas> yeah but there's a weird contradiction cause shaak ti gets called by greivous in original clone wars cartoon
[0:29:18] <+doc_ock_rokc> Jedi can't block every blaster shock numbers can overwhelm jedi
[0:29:20] <notenoughgirls> i think 4
[0:29:22] <Redblood801> IIRC, Shaak Ti is George Lucas's favorite
[0:29:23] <%ChoculaUltra> ngl, was kinda expecting Palps in Rise of Skywalker to say "initiate...Order 67!" right before the fleet of Star Destroyers rose up.
[0:29:29] <+ntfth> Any interest in playing Jedi Fallen Order once you're done with Kotor?

[0:31:50] <%Solidnick18> Yes
[0:31:51] <+Vikingdeath1> I have been waiting to finish Fallen Order, I should do that
[0:31:52] <brachydios777> Nice to see V alright
[0:31:57] <%Solidnick18> It's very good
[0:31:59] <+chiazam> STAR WARS POLITICS TIME
[0:32:02] <RamenRiderZ> That's why the Jedi are ascetic and dont eat
[0:32:03] <Jaku2011> Battlefront 2 is really good
[0:32:04] <%tearfuldevil> how bland is the protag in Fallen Order?
[0:32:04] <%correctedsun117> But my endless EA boycott though

[0:32:05] <Doodle_Taco> @irridium Force hold
[0:32:06] <brachydios777> And it’s FREE
[0:32:06] <+doc_ock_rokc> EA did SO WELL with the license
[0:32:06] <+ntfth> Little V is absolutely right. You should definitely play it...Woolie.
[0:32:15] <bomfiz> I'm hype
[0:32:15] <%ChoculaUltra> imagine having all the money of EA and shitting out 2 and a half Star Wars games in 10 years.
[0:32:16] <%Solidnick18> Respawn did goodwork
[0:32:17] <TheAceol> One of the BIGGEST IPs ever, barely do anything with it
[0:32:19] <%tearfuldevil> cause fromt he trailers he seemed REALLY BLAND
[0:32:19] <%joe_bagadou_nautz> Just Dance star wars
[0:32:22] <+doc_ock_rokc> Seriously why do they still have the license?
[0:32:23] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> set up your own battle area
[0:32:29] <%DatAsuna> TWO DELETED SCENES
[0:32:29] <%ggbhtg> I was excited for a rerelease of Episode 1 Racer, BUT IT GOT DELAYED THE DAY BEFORE RELEASE. Big oofsies.
[0:32:30] <%optimasmaximas> @DatAsuna oh, i never watched it myself, so i was speaking from what mutliple people had said, and i figured base off their reputation and track record they were trustworthy enough for me to just think that what they said was 90% right, oof. and just looked it up, another RotS deleted scene has grievous kill her
[0:32:38] <+chiazam> I like the swing lightsaber and it go WHOOSH
[0:32:38] <DSD24> Did Shaak Ti get diavoled?
[0:32:43] <brachydios777> Battlefront 2 was improved a shit ton
[0:32:52] <%tearfuldevil> i cannot get into the Trails games
[0:32:53] <%DatAsuna> @optimasmaximas now look up the other deleted Rots scene where anakin kils her lol
[0:32:53] <%J0RD4NPR1M3> lego star wars is hilarious
[0:32:55] <gruulmagebeast> shaak ti fight in force unleashed is fun
[0:32:55] <DSD24> Cold Steel is a good series
[0:32:56] <@Commando_Joe> Hope you guys are gonna watch that 'All cinematics from The Old Republic' 40 minute video
[0:32:57] <@chesterr01> SEAN BEAN = SHAAK TI confirmed
[0:32:57] <Redblood801> She canonically gets killed by Anakin in the temple
[0:33:05] <%ggbhtg> BUUUUUUUUUGIIIIIII LUL
[0:33:07] <Jaku2011> Ill play trails when the crossbell games are translated
[0:33:09] <%PR0swagonist> That guy is really trying
[0:33:10] <Silverkry2> trails of cold steel are the definition of mediocre jrpg jank.
[0:33:14] <%CommanderSqueaks> Boogie
[0:33:18] <%DatAsuna> @Commando_Joe I've made plans for that stuff
[0:33:23] <+BubbaRands> CANT STOP WONT STOP
[0:33:25] <%MisterArcanine> Shaak Ti is the original “I lived bitch”
[0:33:27] <+JamesCorck> It's good to see you Little-V. Good to see you're OK man <3
[0:33:27] <+doc_ock_rokc> @brachydios777 it should have been something like its end at the start. instead of a online casino
[0:33:29] <gruulmagebeast> FORCE MAD FORCE MAD
[0:33:30] <%ChoculaUltra> those SWTOR cinematics really do be kinda kino tho.
[0:33:30] <TheAceol> How old is that song?
[0:33:30] <%tearfuldevil> @Silverkry2 yeha i do not get the appeal tbh
[0:33:36] <%Bluemanzee> John Williams is trying to score your life so hard
[0:33:36] <+BoBoGaijin> Next Little V remix, they see me rollin
[0:33:37] <%MisterArcanine> I still am no convinced she is dead
[0:33:38] <%masterpiecejeremy> All them motherfuckers tryna clap you and you just clap back
[0:33:45] <jorniev> oh good
[0:33:50] <%optimasmaximas> @DatAsuna oh i meanti didnt watch the og clone wars where i said grievous killed shaak ti, ive seen RotS and all it's deleted scenes already so i saw that already
[0:33:50] <%tearfuldevil> no, the Dark was an inherent badwrong corruption of the Force
[0:33:53] <%ThePimpGuin> the pink side
[0:34:00] <@chesterr01> @woolieversus Yo V, I like your shirt
[0:34:04] <%J0RD4NPR1M3> the brown side
[0:34:06] <%kekkerscrew> There was the Force and the Darkside. The Darkside was people Corrupting the Force
[0:34:06] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @SunjammerIV
[0:34:06] <%FuqBoiSlim> the reddish-brown side
[0:34:14] <Doodle_Taco> I mean, saying that its a side is pretty obvious
[0:34:15] <%tearfuldevil> the force is naturally "Light", and evil people corrupted the force into "the Dark side"
[0:34:16] <Daskolin> Forum was coruption
[0:34:20] <SunjammerIV> the word "SIDE" implies there's another side yo
[0:34:23] <%optimasmaximas> @chesterr01 please tell me there's merch under there LUL
[0:34:23] <%ggbhtg> It's not that I wanna talk about Kensei, it's that I've failed to mention that specific thing like 30 times over the years. LUL
[0:34:24] <%ChoculaUltra> would you guys rather be the Sith Lord or the Sith Apprentice if we're going by the rule of 2?
[0:34:27] <%DatAsuna> @optimasmaximas It's a weirdly funny death, right? xD
[0:34:35] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> We were saying light side in the 80s and none of us had anything but the movies and toys to work form.
[0:34:40] <%tearfuldevil> that was the original intent
[0:34:40] <%DatAsuna> That's the word of lucas and filoni
[0:34:40] <%OldManDeckardCain> the african side of the force Kappa
[0:34:54] <%joe_bagadou_nautz> it just is
[0:34:55] <%kekkerscrew> The Force was naturally Neutral. The Darkside was people putting their own corruption in it.
[0:34:55] <brachydios777> @doc_ock_rokc Ya definitely, but it’s nice to see improvement rather than ignoring it, *cough* *cough* Battle field 5
[0:34:56] <+doc_ock_rokc> NOPE dark side is a natural part of the force but...the opposite of the light
[0:34:58] <damienlunas> What if you use the dark side but you're still hot
[0:35:00] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Thats what Lucas says, and I hate it
[0:35:12] <%DatAsuna> It's the lucas stance, but lucas has many bad ideas.
[0:35:13] <lotharrio> My interpretation was that the Force was just the Force. The Dark Side was just a quick and dirty way to use it.
[0:35:17] <%jiggy_snipe> there is no light or dark, there just is
[0:35:19] <AlexStAdams> The force is the Tao
[0:35:19] <notenoughgirls> where does bendu fall into all this
[0:35:20] <%joe_bagadou_nautz> is gravity inherently good or evil
[0:35:22] <%tearfuldevil> nature isn't EVIL though
[0:35:22] <%ggbhtg> and nature is scary, damn
[0:35:22] <+doc_ock_rokc> @brachydios777 You think EA did that WILLINGLY? Disney was on their ass
[0:35:22] <%optimasmaximas> @DatAsuna yeah, walks up behind her and "that weird mix of ah/eh death scream" LUL
[0:35:23] <jorniev> it's all just space wizards
[0:35:24] <+caramelatte1> I feel like Jedi, just try to police the force. Calling raw power dark etc.
[0:35:25] <RamenRiderZ> Darkside is Satsui No Hado
[0:35:27] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[0:35:29] <%jiggy_snipe> LUL
[0:35:37] <%kekkerscrew> Midnight Gosple is good
[0:35:39] <raichu1972> iirc the Force as intended is working with it and going with the flow, and is then corrupted into the Dark Side by people trying to force (lol) it to work towards their selfish ends.
[0:35:40] <brachydios777> Dark and Light = Ying and Yang
[0:35:42] <%trustycoyote> Been meaning to watch that too
[0:35:42] <Prevot> oh god that thing sucks
[0:35:44] <%DatAsuna> noted
[0:35:45] <JaseAdrift> ITS SO GOOD
[0:35:46] <%ChoculaUltra> Remember, if you're ugly and use the Dark Side you're a sith. If you're hot you're just a "dArK JEdI."
[0:35:49] <%ggbhtg> Recommendation pile GO UP
