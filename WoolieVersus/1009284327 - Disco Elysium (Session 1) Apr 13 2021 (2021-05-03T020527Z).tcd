[0:01:50] <user_naim> So are we treating this like 13 Sentinels with no chat reading for Woolie? Cause we should
[0:01:51] <teefpal> Why play a normal cop when you can be apocalypse cop?

[0:02:11] <%Juriasu> how the fuck did they record all this dialogue
[0:02:14] <dukenux> I got a fever and a sore throat, but i couldn't miss Hobocop Adventures. less gooo

[0:02:17] <teefpal> mone
[0:02:17] <%doomerskeletor13> It’s a god damn novel
[0:02:17] <Lancaster_H> dude almost EVERYTHING is voiced its so good
[0:02:21] <Cymen90> When will the streaming meta evolve to live-reading classic literature?
[0:02:23] <leith_aziz> You mean cause risk of Politics?
[0:02:23] <Solidnick18> all of it
[0:02:24] <iambqb> These are some Sorry Cops if I've ever seen em'
[0:02:25] <%X2Eliah> @Juriasu Professionally

[0:02:28] <%Mathochism> @Elvung Thanks, good person!
[0:02:28] <%saladin1911> @samuraiknack This man really always has godlike hoodies right? No clue where he gets them tho lmao
[0:02:31] <%MajorCrasher> LET'S FUCKING GO
[0:02:32] <%SainEdge> its soooo much LUL
[0:02:33] <kikoeru_san> Super Smart Sorry Commie Cop was the realest shit for me personally
[0:02:35] <%Juriasu> @X2Eliah but there is so MUCH
[0:02:36] <%SivSarcast> I hope that Encyclopedia VA made some bank with all that recording.
[0:02:37] <teefpal> My only issue is that some of the voices were changed and not as good
[0:02:38] <Lukas_Ipsum> not the narration i think
[0:02:38] <+tussletoes> the voice actors will go beyond the hard r FOR you
[0:02:38] <$JobbedBone> it NEEDED this update for posterity to appreciate it
[0:02:38] <oda_flobunaga> Cop is not voiced though
[0:02:44] <dds333a> @saladin1911 more or less
[0:02:44] <boomlessjay> it also adds 10+ hours to the playtime lol
[0:02:45] <%VyperVic> VyperVic subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months!
[0:02:47] <Solidnick18> which is super crazy
[0:02:49] <dfs_k> joseph anderson did a full playthrough reading everything outloud like a boss, i don't know how he did it
[0:02:51] <problemagic> all gas no brakes
[0:02:52] <teefpal> Cuno's va was way better in the original
[0:02:52] <+RyTYoung> it's wild
[0:02:54] <leith_aziz> Give these guys a round of applause nicobLove nicobLove nicobLove nicobLove
[0:02:57] <%Noonoox12> woolieSHOOK woolieSHOOK woolieSPICE
[0:02:58] <dukenux> a LOT
[0:03:00] <$hattrick61> "Stage" direction is not voiced
[0:03:05] <brachydios777> While we’re free, who here seen Godzilla vs Kong?
[0:03:10] <kikoeru_san> New Cuno sucks compared to old Cuno
[0:03:10] <%Deekman> so does Reggie know ANYTHING about this game?
[0:03:11] <+Thatnerdyrunner> I did
[0:03:12] <%andrewofbob> The game reading itself is great
[0:03:15] <+feign___> it was an accessibility feature! they did greeeeat
[0:03:16] <%holydeviant1> psaCrazyhead
[0:03:18] <@Menitta> what a good name
[0:03:19] <leith_aziz> @dfs_k uh, he always does that. He did play ace attorney
[0:03:25] <dds333a> The reading itself is fine, it's reading for an audience or dead air is tough
[0:03:28] <jorniev> FAILURE it's always an option
[0:03:31] <teefpal> It was good
[0:03:32] <SolSwagGuy56> Nah you wrong. More politics
[0:03:32] <%X2Eliah> @Deekman Reggie knows that he's SORRY
[0:03:33] <Chatterbox1991> exactly
[0:03:33] <leith_aziz> I get it. You get tired of it
[0:03:34] <andre11dr> Oh we better stay free
[0:03:34] <OldManDeckardCain> is this a full lp? because if it is, with the way woolie plays, this is gonna be the longest lp in his career LUL
[0:03:36] <@Menitta> Yeah thats the reasonable take
[0:03:38] <+RyTYoung> So no current politics?
[0:03:38] <+Thatnerdyrunner> All the politics
[0:03:39] <Cymen90> "I do not want politics in my game!" - A Call of Duty Player
[0:03:43] <Tennochief> I'm down with that
[0:03:44] <%DiscoMatador> Put ALL the Politics in my games
[0:03:45] <MemMoor> no politics in this game promise
[0:03:46] <%doomerskeletor13> Give me more politics
[0:03:46] <munitalprats> There's obviously politc burnout
[0:03:46] <%hax_metatron> EVERYTHING
[0:03:47] <rcand9> one of my fave games played by one of my fave games
[0:03:48] <munitalprats> its crazy
[0:03:48] <dds333a> It's always been like that
[0:03:49] <@Menitta> and by reasonable I mean, thats my take
[0:03:52] <%Noonoox12> @OldManDeckardCain prepare thyself. Biggest Chungus is coming
[0:03:54] <DatAsuna> something something culture war
[0:03:54] <valriot> Difference between Politics, and "Orange Man Bad", like dont need preaching to see hes a dickhead
[0:03:54] <tmo200> Did he start yet?
[0:03:54] <%JustToWatch> oh we gonna have POLITICS in this game
[0:03:54] <Solidnick18> it's in games
[0:03:56] <problemagic> I get it. But everything is political. The status quo is a political construct.
[0:03:57] <naoi0> Dunk on all the politics
[0:03:57] <%X2Eliah> Everything is a little bit political, but it's stupid to turn everything 100% political
[0:03:58] <OldManDeckardCain> LUL
[0:03:59] <munitalprats> Games helped people escape
[0:04:00] <naoi0> @tmo200 No
[0:04:03] <%Noonoox12> THE DISCO ARC BEGINS
[0:04:04] <teefpal> As a materialist the cry of "no politics" is itself HIGHLY POLTICAL
[0:04:04] <Lancaster_H> c u r r e n t y e a r
[0:04:05] <andre11dr> Well THIS ESPECIALLY gets pretty political
[0:04:07] <tmo200> Nice
[0:04:07] <Johannen> WOooooooo...Disco
[0:04:07] <TheToanon> "Everything is political" is the wrong phrase, what people should actually be saying is "everything is philosophical"
[0:04:09] <user_naim> Imprison us, silence us, we demand it. We cannot be allowed to speak
[0:04:09] <SolSwagGuy56> You can live in a stimulusless cave if you're scared of politics
[0:04:13] <kikoeru_san> Commie time baby
[0:04:14] <%CaptainPileDriver> YEYEYEYEYE
[0:04:15] <@Menitta> this game is not gonna be....yeah
[0:04:15] <ALTRNico> cowards
[0:04:16] <%Juriasu> wait what this game is polotical Kappa
[0:04:16] <Tennochief> @x2eliah that right here
[0:04:17] <leith_aziz> I think people just dont wanna reminded of the world they live in and want an escape rom reality
[0:04:17] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:04:20] <oda_flobunaga> Politics= many bloodsucking insects
[0:04:21] <vavilonica> fun fac, this game was created by an estonian left wing cultural movement group
[0:04:21] <%Noonoox12> Disco elysium LIVES in politics
[0:04:21] <naoi0> This game does hit really hard at times
[0:04:22] <$hattrick61> KINGDOM OF CONSCIENCE BAYBEE
[0:04:22] <tattleworm> and then you find yourself screaming at wonder woman for israeli propaganda
[0:04:23] <+InternetShis> Enjoy MAXIMUM POLITICS
[0:04:23] <pacibuddy> Money is the base of society and the existence of money is a political issue
[0:04:24] <AvroEltz> NO POLITICS HERE
[0:04:24] <%SivSarcast> What a well-timed message lol
[0:04:24] <%hermitsen> the problem is that people always /only seem to want a break from 'certain kinds' of politics
[0:04:24] <%egressanon> COMMIE COP
[0:04:25] <leith_aziz> *be reminded
[0:04:26] <kikoeru_san> Fuck the Ultras and the Fash
[0:04:26] <problemagic> lets get political
[0:04:26] <bonebagMEL> This game will STAB yout beliefs
[0:04:27] <+feign___> it does makes sense lmao. but also people can be shit at interpreting politics to a work and make it meaningful to life and the work itself
[0:04:27] <%Lion_kun> RACE THEORY
[0:04:29] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's gonna get REAL
[0:04:31] <%livlinn> woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE
[0:04:32] <TheFramedWarlock> Let's build GARGANTUAN COMMUNISM
[0:04:34] <+KeySosa54> HAIL KRAV MAZOV
[0:04:34] <linSP> Politics +R
[0:04:36] <brachydios777> I don’t want politics in my marvel series they say as it’s about captain AMERICA
[0:04:37] <bonebagMEL> I can't wait for them to get to measurehead
[0:04:38] <%egressanon> RACIST COMMIE COP
[0:04:41] <brunoberserk> were's the politics in TETRIS ???
[0:04:44] <jorniev> Everything revolves around sex, except sex sex it's about power
[0:04:46] <andre11dr> I know where i went on it BIG ANARCHISM
[0:04:46] <leith_aziz> nicobYareYare nicobYareYare nicobYareYare nicobYareYare nicobYareYare nicobYareYare
[0:04:50] <dds333a> Great game, ASB
[0:04:50] <munitalprats> RACIST COMMIE FREE MARKET HOBO COP
[0:04:50] <Cymen90> MOTIONS ARE DUMB FOREVER
[0:04:51] <+shradke> Y’all should read Jacques Ranciere’s The Politics of Literature, amazing at discussing the politicization of art.
[0:04:51] <+InternetShis> White supremacist ancap commie sorry hobo art cop
[0:04:56] <+tussletoes> Let's become the Communism Warrior Cop
[0:04:56] <+feign___> Tetris is radical centrism
[0:04:58] <%ggbhtg> ggbhtg subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months, currently on a 2 month streak! HE, LIVED, BITCH. Welcome back, Reg. Now, in order to be topical to the podcast: Woolz, I DM'd you an edit to the song used for intermissions. And now, back to the shadows I go, as I do my best to not look like that woolieONEGUY from that documentary.
[0:04:59] <%CaptainPileDriver> cause american vs japan ideology
[0:05:01] <$dudedude55555> @brunoberserk the rights to tetris were political
[0:05:03] <leith_aziz> I think cause some moves can be OP when a bit simpler
[0:05:06] <Chatterbox1991> And there's the circumstances where it's not the political nature of it specifically as much as it is said politics being handled poorly (IE Detroit: Become Human)
[0:05:08] <%X2Eliah> But fighting games are all about "no but it must be hard tho"
[0:05:08] <leith_aziz> look at DP's
[0:05:09] <friedy_one> @woolieversus Make sure to use the highlight button often
[0:05:10] <%lostcolors> I hate mk inputs man
[0:05:11] <@Menitta> Mortal Kombat 11 actually had an option for turning the MK motions into basic SF motions
[0:05:20] <@Solidus_113> MK inputs suck
[0:05:25] <Solidnick18> i think jack-o had that
[0:05:28] <%jinking79> that's still the same input in a way
[0:05:28] <@Menitta> and I hate MK inputs so I turned that on
[0:05:29] <$hattrick61> Kingdom of conscience, i just wanna grill for chrissake
[0:05:29] <leith_aziz> It depends I guess.
[0:05:30] <+shradke> Right stick is yo friend
[0:05:35] <jorniev> I'm ok if it varies per characters
[0:05:36] <@Solidus_113> @Menitta yeah and they had to be hyper accurate or they wouldn't come out
[0:05:37] <%Juriasu> motians are too hard for smash players says Woolie
[0:05:39] <problemagic> go away pretzel!
[0:05:40] <MKII> it's not that hard. I have a feeling people are getting stuck because they lift their thumb up between inputs? cuz that would work for mk but not for a qcf input
[0:05:40] <Solidnick18> which was just down down and button
[0:05:42] <dukenux> Most riveting Cop Gameplay since Cole "You're free... for now" Phelps
[0:05:45] <+skyheys> unequal execution is a bad idea
[0:05:48] <%ggbhtg> REJECT INPUTS, RETURN TO EO
[0:05:51] <leith_aziz> I do like that Smash has the option for both, and the harder input gives better reward
[0:05:53] <primaryfire> motions are also for balance
[0:05:53] <OldManDeckardCain> the problem is a lot of creators focus on their own politics more than on making an actual good game. focus on that first and then add all your propaganda (maybe try to make it more subtle if you can?)
[0:05:55] <%ggbhtg> Return to EASY OPERATION
[0:05:56] <brachydios777> Was there ever a fighting game that lets you customize inputs?
[0:05:57] <andre11dr> MK inputs did suck but i got used to them playing MKX
[0:05:59] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Turn based fighting game inputs
[0:06:02] <TheBlackestBaron> MK's inputs feel unnatural most of the time.
[0:06:02] <%VyperVic> @dukenux god the LA Noire LP was next level

[0:08:14] <%Juriasu> they made charge moves instant holy shit
[0:08:17] <dds333a> It made it easy as shit
[0:08:21] <munitalprats> the funniest thing is if you removed inputs, Daigo would smash people HARDER and people dont get that
[0:08:22] <leith_aziz> he did....
[0:08:23] <+FuqBoiSlim> 3DS Guile still the best
[0:08:24] <dds333a> broken, in fact
[0:08:24] <mr_sups> I had a buddy who just got into SFV, told him to play ED. He liked that he didn't have to do motions
[0:08:28] <MKII> motions aren't hard and people who quit there don't what's waiting for them afterwards
[0:08:29] <+Jakeofalco> Yo!
[0:08:31] <%jinking79> wat a charge character in the 3d sf4

[0:08:41] <%holydeviant1> Motions lock in various positions, buttons force finger positions, etc etc
[0:08:46] <dds333a> Balances it
[0:08:47] <Equirah> balance the moves for the motions

[0:09:02] <OldManDeckardCain> reject zoners, RETURN TO MONKEE
[0:09:08] <leith_aziz> Some inputs also balance out some strong moves. DP's, Fafnir, command grabs
[0:09:09] <andre11dr> But some games incorporate these "friendly mechanics" so strong that it because one of the better things you can do, like auto combos in DBFZ
[0:09:10] <leith_aziz> etc
[0:09:12] <$lumporr> cheer500 i'm an actor out of college, thinking about feasibility of being a streamer. your opinion, what's the first thing i should do (including potentially "turn back!")? thanks and love
[0:09:15] <jorniev> any opinions on power ranger ryu and chun li?
[0:09:17] <mr_sups> I want more characters like Ed and Falke. Simple input characters, for people who don't want the motions.
[0:09:23] <muXPerience> Reactionaries be another thing politically
[0:09:25] <brunoberserk> walking forward sonic booms is fucking CURSED dnoWRAITH
[0:09:31] <brachydios777> For my curiosity, what the hell started the Livewire bit from the podcast yesterday?
[0:09:34] <Jonny_Uppercut> Oh damn Woolie is starting the Disco Elysium flaveHYPE
[0:09:35] <Lukas_Ipsum> I'm usually on the youtube, didn't realize the preshow was Woolie's Words of Wisdom. this is cool.
[0:09:45] <iambqb> I feel like things like that are built around the stick moves being a traditional/expected thing, rather than that dynamic requiring stick moves to implement.
[0:09:47] <dds333a> You had to commit, kinda
[0:09:57] <@Menitta> One thing I dont like is people saying stuff like Guilty Gear or SF should get rid of motions. No, these games have been built on those motions. If it was a new game, sure but not existing decade long franchises.
[0:10:00] <+s_xylocalsingles> @lumporr turn back, youre already poor coming out of college
[0:10:09] <%VyperVic> "I talked to the prophet." -Woolie
[0:10:10] <+s_xylocalsingles> @lumporr making it as a streamer is pure RNG
[0:10:12] <problemagic> disco elysium: 2 hour FGC podcast edition
[0:10:17] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's like it birdie's dp didn't have to be charged
[0:10:28] <@Solidus_113> play Granblue and wait for Project L
[0:10:35] <+FuqBoiSlim> I think the issue is a lot of gamers just have like 0 sense of rhythm and thats why combos and motions filter the fuck outta them. Listen to some D'Angelo or something. get some jonz in ya bonz
[0:10:37] <%jinking79> that input is easy now
[0:10:43] <rcand9> calm down chat we always talk beforehand
[0:10:44] <teefpal> I'm still waiting for a Battlebots fighting game tbh
[0:10:45] <%VyperVic> @problemagic imagine disco elysium as a fighting game
[0:11:03] <brachydios777> I still want my Godzilla fighting game
[0:11:05] <Visorak6> Or the input is so long it straight up cant reaction counter certain things
[0:11:08] <$lumporr> @s_xylocalsingles i mean yeah, i know my limits in terms of financial/time investment. just wanted to ask
[0:11:09] <%jinking79> till u play online
[0:11:12] <iambqb> @VyperVic it is a fight, against the strongest boss character of all, life
[0:11:13] <%X2Eliah> @FuqBoiSlim Don't talk to Woolie about 0 sense of rhythm
[0:11:21] <nelsonsaysbooya> Unusual question: Would a fighting game character be strong if it had 2 different inputs for the same move? Like if you had a Dragon Punch that could be launched from either DP or Flash Kick motion?
[0:11:21] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1381828284657324036?s=20
[0:11:28] <%YakumoYomi> @VyperVic Like...having to do inputs and motions for your dialogue choices?
[0:11:28] <+s_xylocalsingles> @lumporr im happy for you for knowing your limits, good luck
[0:11:29] <$lumporr> @s_xylocalsingles sure but i wanna know how to get my best shot
[0:11:30] <munitalprats> Motion inputs are important, and getting rid of them wont make you better at the game.
[0:11:33] <muXPerience> @vypervic dude just imagine the writing in the move list. 'ace's low' for kim kitsuragi's upper cut
[0:11:35] <Cymen90> Have you gotten more than 10 hits in Arkham Asylum tho?
[0:11:35] <+Noonoox12> Potemkin BUSTER
[0:11:47] <%VyperVic> @muXPerience That's kino
[0:11:51] <leith_aziz> @Menitta: That argument usually doesnt work because people arent in new games like fantasy strike. They want things to work how they want in the gamne THEY're interested in. I also dont mind each game switching it up once in a while. For devs, it can get boring doing the same type of game over and over. But to each their own
[0:11:53] <pacibuddy> touhou fighting game's Pentagram Input
[0:11:57] <jorniev> what is the input for the COMUNISIM move?
[0:12:03] <Cymen90> THERE ARE ALTERNATIVES
[0:12:04] <%ggbhtg> Meanwhile MVC3 Zero charge is a minor nuisance
[0:12:04] <teefpal> What would Harry's moveset be though
[0:12:05] <%X2Eliah> That's some really fucked up game design though, "hurt your hand to play good"
[0:12:07] <@Menitta> Guile is made around charge motions. If you could instantly do a Flash kick or sonic boom , that would be busted as hell
[0:12:16] <munitalprats> The alternatives have always been inferior, and will remain inferior @Cymen90
[0:12:23] <teefpal> He'd have to have a custom moveset for his iedology/copotype
[0:12:25] <SolSwagGuy56> Even if they simplify inputs, you'll still get stomped. Easier inputs won't make you better
[0:12:26] <%VyperVic> @teefpal ask me again during the final session of this game
[0:12:31] <jorniev> cop of the apocalypse is too OP
[0:12:33] <pacibuddy> Core-A video about this is really good
[0:12:33] <munitalprats> you would STILL get stomped
[0:12:38] <%LCLSmoothie> @teefpal his buttons make him instantly black out
[0:12:39] <problemagic> @jorniev 478P
[0:12:42] <andre11dr> The thing that infuriates me is when Smash players complain about motions, even though they perform things in Smash that requires more execution than those inputs
[0:12:42] <munitalprats> Daigo would crush people HARDER with one button shoryus.
[0:12:46] <brachydios777> Wasn’t Divekick made to make fun of fighting game inputs by having one button ?
[0:12:50] <Cymen90> @munitalprats fighting game conservatives lol
[0:12:51] <leith_aziz> I mean UI Goku has some pretty simple inputs and combos, and he's STUPID strong
[0:12:53] <aiutare47> I FORGOT ABOUT THAT
[0:13:00] <%phd_in_thuggery> Cheer510 Hey guys, been going through a rough patch in life and glad to have the streams to kinda help pull me through it all. keep up the good vibes and surprises.
[0:13:02] <FloatYourGoat> what was that game you retweeted a while back, looked kind of like project BBQ but was indie?
[0:13:04] <DeathByPoke7> tough love arena
[0:13:06] <%ggbhtg> Tough Love Arean
[0:13:06] <ALTRNico> Granblue too
[0:13:08] <TheFramedWarlock> TOUGH Love Arena
[0:13:08] <%ggbhtg> arg
[0:13:23] <%eyezehuhh> let's gooooo!
[0:13:24] <%HollowedIdjit> I'm just hoping DNF Duel is good
[0:13:25] <+Exicuren> Granblue also has something similar
[0:13:26] <%VyperVic> @phd_in_thuggery hope things get better for you, Dr. Thug
[0:13:31] <rcand9> smash has inputs now Kappa
[0:13:32] <%nintega010> Nelson in KOF14. was all cmd moves
[0:13:32] <he1lhydra> "punch love" arena? freudian slip? c805BuuHoo
[0:13:39] <+Exicuren> ah yes, fantasy strike
[0:13:40] <leith_aziz> I find it TOO simple, but I dont mind you enjoying it
[0:13:45] <%phd_in_thuggery> I hope so too, thanks Vyper
[0:13:46] <%Kriss1827> Power Rangers doesn't have inputs right? like complicated ones
[0:13:48] <OldManDeckardCain> speaking of daigo, hifight has a ne vid on daigo guild vs sako menat
[0:13:52] <OldManDeckardCain> fun watch
[0:13:56] <problemagic> movies don't have inputs
[0:13:56] <@Solidus_113> They're just as good, but they have a longer cooldown
[0:13:57] <leith_aziz> Too me, its also lackluster in look and character design.
[0:14:00] <munitalprats> Daigo would crush you harder with one button Dps.
[0:14:03] <andre11dr> But it has bad online so who cares
[0:14:06] <TheFramedWarlock> Power Rangers also just added Ryu and Chun Li
[0:14:11] <leith_aziz> dont know about PR
[0:14:14] <MKII> power rangers is one button specials yeah
[0:14:22] <%ggbhtg> @TheFramedWarlock To GRID?
[0:14:28] <%ggbhtg> sensible explanation said.....REJECT Inputs, RETURN TO EO
[0:14:29] <%HollowedIdjit> Yo BFTG IS HYPE
[0:14:31] <munitalprats> Motion inputs arent the thing holding you back
[0:14:35] <TheFramedWarlock> Yeah, Battle for the Grid
[0:14:35] <munitalprats> Look at fucking BROLYLEGS
[0:14:36] <he1lhydra> power rangers makes up for it with the tag system
[0:14:37] <munitalprats> THAT CHAMPION
[0:14:39] <jorniev> cun li LOOKS SO GOOOD
[0:14:39] <%CaptainPileDriver> I mean, dbfz doesn't have complex moves
[0:14:40] <%YakumoYomi> Power Rangers is also getting a "Complete Edition" next month (all DLC, including Ryu and Chun Li included)
[0:14:44] <%ggbhtg> REJECT Inputs, RETURN TO EO
[0:14:44] <crimsonharvest> Final Fantasy 6 has alternate inputs for Sabin's blitzes that don't include circle motions
[0:14:47] <TheFramedWarlock> You can play Ryu and Chun Li in power ranger costumes
[0:14:55] <%phd_in_thuggery> BFTG is the most "What the fuck is going on?" I've felt in a while with a fighter
[0:14:56] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's either q-circle forward or backwards
[0:15:00] <jorniev> chunli works too much as a power ranger
[0:15:04] <WeepyDevil> my biggest complaint of bftg is the music lol fucking Saban
[0:15:08] <munitalprats> Brolylegs controls the motion inputs with his fuckin' teeth
[0:15:09] <%ggbhtg> Legacy Wars DLC, thank fucking god finally
[0:15:11] <munitalprats> hes a hero
[0:15:14] <AmericanaRed> LETS FUCK IT UP

[0:15:32] <jorniev> IM MORALIST APOCALYPSE
[0:15:32] <%saladin1911> I suck shit at fighting games but I enjoy motions as opposed to tilts or whatever. Games that has simplified input scheme I find to be super bland. The issue I have is execution requirements due to low hit-stun and such. Thankfully this is mostly going away so I'm good.
[0:15:33] <OldManDeckardCain> please don't be commie, literally everyone runs a variant of a commie cop LUL

[0:28:31] <bonebagMEL> This game soundtrack is pretty good. Tiger King is my fav track, is the first track you hear when you start the game.
[0:28:32] <andre11dr> Woolie did play FF7R off stream
[0:28:48] <+KeySosa54> where my Sorry Cop Gang at?
[0:28:48] <Applecannon63> I can't believe Ryu and Chun li Ranger are in Power Ranger:Bftg

[0:29:07] <dukenux> that's just called being tired
[0:29:07] <Lukas_Ipsum> i get that now and then, but it always passes
[0:29:08] <brachydios777> That’s a bad feeling
[0:29:20] <%LCLSmoothie> that was me a couple months ago, sucked so much
[0:29:21] <naoi0> Work bot brrt.
[0:29:22] <%beatherha> beatherha subscribed at Tier 1.
[0:29:22] <%Seancicle> FootYellow
[0:29:23] <+RyTYoung> So that's why Woolie never played Batman Arkham NotLikeThis
[0:29:24] <Mrcowabungaa> Or even worse than not the time; not the energy, even if you want to.
[0:29:26] <dukenux> ye, that happens
[0:29:27] <%livlinn> Ooof that happened in my college years
[0:29:29] <xpakeo> i literally just got out of that rut
[0:29:31] <benupde287> I had that season too. its a good feeling when you find somebody who you can unwind with and enjoy games with
[0:29:32] <laguerrilha> To be fair after a couple of month i drop and rotated games/comics/series/music/guitar etc. i get bored easy
[0:29:32] <jorniev> its was pretty bad for me when it happened
[0:29:33] <%ggbhtg> My Gamer time was PS1 era to PS2, never owned a PS3
[0:29:33] <GarbageNirvana> also sometimes they're just not that many good games out there
[0:29:36] <DSD24> Back into videogames
[0:29:38] <dukenux> it sucks if more if you have a huge backlog
[0:29:39] <%gatorafan> BACK IN!

[0:57:53] <Gomfury> oh boy we're gonna be here for a while
[0:57:53] <linSP> encyclopedia is too much
[0:57:55] <laguerrilha> I like the Encyclopedia, i learned a lot of factoids
[0:57:55] <%X2Eliah> WORST BOY
[0:57:56] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @gnosislord I played this game with my uncle and cousin both who are psychologist and we spent like 1:30 hours on thjs screen lol
[0:57:58] <+CursedNobleman> jepardy!
[0:57:59] <MyNameIsRasus> LIVIN IN THE DATABASE OOOOH
[0:57:59] <%Darmanimon> Hi Reggie, I hope you feel better! We all missed you
[0:57:59] <leith_aziz> oh, I'd love that
[0:58:00] <+Shonen_hero> encylopedia adds a lot of dialogue. Some say too much
[0:58:06] <%beatherha> What is this? a font for ants?
[0:58:07] <+admiral_of_crunch> Encyclopedia is the hero of my mind palace
[0:58:09] <chaingrabss> cirBlind
[0:58:09] <twoto858> theres an option for text size
[0:58:10] <+OblivionSword1> It is pretty small
[0:58:12] <nomos42> The rest of the text is larger
[0:58:12] <kikoeru_san> Lore dump the stat
[0:58:13] <Lukas_Ipsum> that 4 looks a lot like a 6 dont it?
[0:58:13] <%wolfofsound> @BallerSwagBro9k that sounds awesome

[0:58:28] <aiutare47> MAX
[0:58:29] <dukenux> its max
[0:58:31] <zanzibarian_hamster> No? It's book smarts
[0:58:31] <twoto858> oh damn
[0:58:31] <nomos42> The dialogue isn't that size
[0:58:32] <dukenux> welp
[0:58:39] <+Avalonicous> Disco Elysium is very unpolitical Kappa
[0:58:40] <listopat> the option only affects dialogue iirc
[0:58:43] <%wolfofsound> @WoolieVersus put your glasses on and nothing will be wrong
[0:58:43] <%Juriasu> the text will be larger in game, that screen though won't change
[0:58:45] <kikoeru_san> Encyclopedia is a very fun skill, helps you interact better with the world
[0:58:46] <derap41> Time to make out with the screen
[0:58:46] <Louie_Salmon> Dialogue is better, but yeah lots of text here
[0:58:47] <+pectusumbra> this is the most text that will be on a screen at once I want to say
[0:58:47] <%X2Eliah> Dialogue will be bigger
[0:58:48] <+OblivionSword1> that menu's text is pretty small
[0:58:50] <brachydios777> I imagine Framerate isn’t too important here
[0:58:50] <%PirateDad_> Actual dialogue should be much bigger than that
[0:58:52] <%Darmanimon> no twitch integration DansGame
[0:58:54] <%saladin1911> That seems like an oversight from them lmao
[0:58:54] <Kongro_> You could lower resolution and keep it fullscreened
[0:59:02] <dukenux> Yeah dialogue boxes are bigger than that
[0:59:09] <andre11dr> I'll be real i just went fuck it and started with a 5 Inland Empire wich is kinda wild
[0:59:12] <kikoeru_san> Wow are you serious
[0:59:24] <muXPerience> @andre11dr high on life
[0:59:28] <%beatherha> Encyclopedia adds a lot of world building that isn't useful at all usually
[0:59:28] <+askalta> hahaja

[0:59:42] <laguerrilha> yeah they didnt change the explanation size. it needs to be fixed
[0:59:48] <%X2Eliah> Rhetoric yeeeeeeeee
[0:59:48] <teefpal> Yeah its the dark side of knowledge
[0:59:51] <naoi0> Very realistic fantasy world
[0:59:55] <leith_aziz> interesting that the game itself decides to tell you this
[0:59:55] <brachydios777> I never heard the term inland empire till this game
[0:59:57] <Asuterisuku> I like how the game encourages hou to NOT max out skills
[0:59:58] <Gomfury> Is this PC? Console versions have issues
[0:59:58] <brunoberserk> play with a BINOCULARS
[1:00:00] <+Shonen_hero> I love this game's world
[1:00:04] <kikoeru_san> like fucking wow, the cigarette drop lol
[1:00:04] <+Arnoldoaad1> Encyclopedia is definitely the one that gives the most flavor to the world

[1:08:01] <%beatherha> It's good
[1:08:05] <ingman112> It’s essentially your imagination

[1:08:07] <CruxAustralis> @cobalt_phoenix_ it's objects talking to you basically
[1:08:09] <primaryfire> the simplest way to put it is this is your imagination
[1:08:10] <+FlyingRamen> twin peaksish
[1:08:10] <Hocotate> Hallucinate potentially useful things

[1:08:15] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @cobalt_phoenix_ oh ok, thanks
[1:08:17] <CrimsonFox777> Inland Empire was 2006
[1:08:18] <thefriendlylich> Yeah, Inland Empire turns you into a Francis York Morgan, or a Dale Cooper.
[1:08:18] <+KeySosa54> Stop calling things from the 2000's old, you're killing me here
[1:08:18] <%X2Eliah> It's basically the IMAGINATION stat
[1:08:21] <pi_in_the_sci> Inland Empire will spoil the ending in the first 5 minutes. Very Lynchian
[1:08:21] <problemagic> precisely
[1:08:21] <MyNameIsRasus> mind palace shit
[1:08:21] <%saladin1911> Mind Palace?
[1:08:26] <%insomniacCoder> guessing, try lowering the resolution, it might change the text font size
[1:08:26] <CruxAustralis> if you have played Vampire, Inland Empire is playing Malkavian
[1:08:28] <+admiral_of_crunch> It's the Malkavian stat
[1:08:29] <%Noonoox12> @KeySosa54 he aint wrong tho
[1:08:30] <%beatherha> The movie is about dopplgangers and taking trauma into it's own story

[1:08:58] <+Shonen_hero> this part always make you rethink your stat spread
[1:09:00] <CruxAustralis> Inland Epire is the best
[1:09:01] <%phd_in_thuggery> YOUR TIE IS TALKING TO YOU
[1:09:04] <+HeroSolaire> Malkavian is a mixture of Inland Empire and Shivers
[1:09:05] <%wolfofsound> one of my favorite ones
[1:09:06] <derap41> hippy shit
[1:09:12] <$dudedude55555> malk
[1:09:13] <andre11dr> Let's just say IT REALLY lets drink the collaid

[1:09:23] <+Shonen_hero> because your stats determine the cap of each type of skill
[1:09:24] <+Kataguro> It's Deadly Premonition/Twin Peaks
[1:09:26] <leith_aziz> This is a really interesting one
[1:09:26] <+eanscrale> Listen to your tie, they're sober more often than you are.
[1:09:27] <CrimsonFox777> "Squidward, the ceiling is talking to me!"
[1:09:29] <sporeian94> THIS SUIT BURNS BETTER
[1:09:31] <MyNameIsRasus> it's imagination kinda
[1:09:33] <%saladin1911> "You hear that, Zack?" The build
[1:09:34] <Asuterisuku> What's the native resolution of your TV?

[1:30:47] <hit2key> The Jotaro stat
[1:30:49] <%EdenOfSecondAccount> can you go above 6 in disco, or is that the maximum
[1:30:55] <dukenux> Yare Yare
[1:31:02] <SolSwagGuy56> >:(
[1:31:03] <Gomfury> @EdenOfSecondAccount yes, the caps can go up
[1:31:07] <%Noonoox12> @EdenOfSecondAccount yes... but it's generally a bad idea
[1:31:09] <SolSwagGuy56> Yare Yare
[1:31:13] <%Juriasu> oh god
[1:31:21] <%BusterRepukken> dont they?
[1:31:22] <derap41> HAH!
[1:31:24] <%dreadedcthulhu> funny joke
[1:31:31] <$hattrick61> FASHION COP
[1:31:32] <derap41> Biggest joke in the entire game
[1:31:32] <+OblivionSword1> FASHION POOLICE
[1:31:36] <+xerotwo> YARE YARE DAWA
[1:31:36] <aiutare47> They usually get transferred one town over
[1:31:38] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> stop describing me okay
[1:31:38] <+InternetShis> Good joke
[1:31:39] <+ReallyBigRocks> So basically every stat is important
[1:31:41] <Gomfury> @Juriasu the skill checks always have a critical pass/fail snake eys or boxcars
[1:31:42] <MyNameIsRasus> built different
[1:31:43] <$emptyantics> Fashion Gestapo
[1:31:46] <primaryfire> @EdenOfSecondAccount 6 is the maximum base but you can upgrade the stats individually after
[1:31:50] <+RealThiele> BIG Drip
[1:31:52] <problemagic> Shivers is wonderful
[1:31:52] <Asuterisuku> Jolyne's anime design is so good
[1:31:54] <%saladin1911> Or maybe they just get transferred after a short payed suspension? sbfpPat
[1:31:56] <huskarl_zap> Attributes cannot be increased
[1:31:56] <jorniev> @emptyantics THATS PRETTY GOOD
[1:31:56] <naoi0> Back down
[1:31:58] <%doomerskeletor13> Psyche PogChamp
[1:32:01] <%Lion_kun> Inland
[1:32:03] <MyNameIsRasus> i need part 6 in my veins
[1:32:05] <+HeroSolaire> Intelligent Physical Cop
[1:32:05] <CuttleCrow> skill caps can go higher, not stats, so right now logic can go to 12
[1:32:06] <user_naim> I love how they’re all good, and it fucking hurts to sacrifice
[1:32:12] <+HeroSolaire> the Chad build
[1:32:14] <%Lion_kun> More psyche
[1:32:14] <%SirGO0SE> PogChamp
[1:32:14] <Space_Pagan> Shivers!
[1:32:15] <$emptyantics> Is Inland Empire good?
[1:32:16] <problemagic> Honestly they are ALL good
[1:32:16] <yuribo26> Make a Himbo
[1:32:17] <Iwashi94> do inland!
[1:32:17] <derap41> A walking Analyser
[1:32:17] <%PirateDad_> Shivers
[1:32:19] <%hax_metatron> SHIVERS
[1:32:21] <ATPsoldat> they are all good
[1:32:21] <+red_cuppa> well hell that's two for psyche
[1:32:22] <naoi0> That's a quarter of the skills woolie
[1:32:22] <+RealThiele> woolie is making himself, perfect
[1:32:23] <%Darmanimon> inland empire is funny
[1:32:27] <+khalcipher> Im a fan of 6,1,2,4
[1:32:28] <problemagic> Shivers does rule though. FEEL the city
[1:32:30] <andre11dr> AUTHORITY?
[1:32:31] <%Juriasu> @WoolieVersus you should probably change tye stat lines then if you want those
[1:32:31] <+pectusumbra> maybe 5-3-3-2 and put signature in not-int?
[1:32:34] <velgaduere> looks like Woolie wants more Psyche
[1:32:34] <+Shikari21> inland empire is my fav
[1:32:34] <rcand9> these are all good stats so dont sweat picking any of them
[1:32:35] <nelsonsaysbooya> You only get 1
[1:32:35] <Robot_Nixon_> electro-chemistry moon2DEV
[1:32:36] <primaryfire> so psyche is definitely going up a point
[1:32:36] <umbermarch> Shivers has the best prose.
[1:32:37] <+CursedNobleman> @emptyantics its good, but you need enough to start with
[1:32:40] <Narbarec> Inland plus Shivers gives some absolutely amazing shit
[1:32:41] <twohitgood> empathy is useful
[1:32:42] <+YaBish311> You only get 1
[1:32:47] <Gomfury> The magic number for IE is 4
[1:32:48] <ingman112> 4-4-2-2 and signature perception?
[1:32:48] <asurite_warrior> having 4 in any stat helps you enough in my opinion
[1:32:50] <+RealThiele> empathy is such an asshole
[1:32:53] <+NopeBadguy> @woolieversus most visual calculus checks require perception to even see in the first place
[1:32:54] <+Kataguro> You can die hard
[1:32:54] <+metzselaar> 5322?
[1:32:55] <$hattrick61> YES
[1:32:56] <naoi0> you can totally die
[1:32:57] <Solidnick18> idk
[1:32:58] <+ChubbyPencil> oh boy can you
[1:32:58] <DovaDude29> Choose a lower leveled skill
[1:32:58] <+HeroSolaire> Yes you can get game over
[1:32:58] <Picia000123> you totally can
[1:32:58] <reddpop_> oh boy can you
[1:32:59] <Torgue_1> Oh, you can
[1:32:59] <problemagic> you can REALLY die
[1:32:59] <%Lion_kun> 3333?
[1:33:00] <CuttleCrow> you want endurance or volition at at least 2
[1:33:01] <%VyperVic> @khalcipher 1 in PSY or PHY makes you into 1 hit wonders
[1:33:02] <UvBenServed> LUL
[1:33:02] <%HollowedIdjit> OH YOU SURE CAN
[1:33:02] <bonebagMEL> You 100% can die / fail
[1:33:02] <Timarkot> 4 4 2 2
[1:33:02] <pacibuddy> its EASY to die
[1:33:03] <%doomerskeletor13> Death comes for us all
[1:33:03] <%DiscoMatador> 100%
[1:33:04] <Dio_TR> 4332
[1:33:04] <+beardy_foxbear> Very easily
[1:33:04] <RossMirage> Every stat is useful.
[1:33:05] <Space_Pagan> You can die at the start LUL
[1:33:06] <primaryfire> you can die in the first room
[1:33:06] <+OblivionSword1> You can absolutely die
[1:33:06] <naoi0> Death comes easy
[1:33:07] <hazycosmicjam> 5 3 2 2
[1:33:08] <+HumanDoctor> 2442
[1:33:09] <reonome> you can die easy
[1:33:10] <lambishly> Psyche and Physique are your 2 life bars
[1:33:11] <zanzibarian_hamster> 4422
[1:33:11] <+mechslayer71> 3333 is wack as fuck
[1:33:13] <iambqb> You can die within the first minute of the game
[1:33:14] <%Darmanimon> imagine if death was not a fail state
[1:33:14] <+agarbagefox> it's possible to die VERY quickly in this game lol
[1:33:15] <%Yung_Booker> Yung_Booker subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months!
[1:33:18] <+ReallyBigRocks> Straight 3s
[1:33:21] <+itsgundamu> having 1 in anything can end up real bad
[1:33:22] <%Juriasu> I'd go 3 4 3 2 from what is sounds like you want
[1:33:23] <andre11dr> Inland Empire and Shivers are my faves ,but yeah Volition and Endurance are really important
[1:33:25] <Blank9> stat is your starting level for a skill too
[1:33:25] <%FallenAngelZelos> every stat distribution is viable
[1:33:28] <CuttleCrow> this IS the customizing
[1:33:30] <+HumanDoctor> 2486
[1:33:30] <nelsonsaysbooya> People have won starting with 1s everywhere
[1:33:33] <CappuccinoGuil> Disco Elysium Part 0 should be the character building LUL
[1:33:33] <+aishman> straight 3s is pretty bad
[1:33:35] <+HotBloodedHero> You either die, or you die in a really funny or sad way.
[1:33:38] <problemagic> Back is to change your stats
[1:33:38] <%Lion_kun> inland
[1:33:38] <nomos42> You don't customise further
[1:33:41] <+aishman> You won't get anywhere
[1:33:45] <problemagic> This is the end of customizing
[1:33:47] <naoi0> THey'reee almost done
[1:33:47] <%doomerskeletor13> This is it
[1:33:48] <laguerrilha> i set my signature to a low sat so balance it
[1:33:48] <Picia000123> Having 6 in anything is very bold, I will tell you that
[1:33:51] <aiutare47> oh he doesnt know
[1:33:53] <aiutare47> this is it
[1:33:56] <andre11dr> You probably shouldn't go above 6
[1:33:56] <+Kataguro> 5322
[1:34:00] <dukenux> Psyche seems important
[1:34:06] <aiutare47> there is no other screen
[1:34:11] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Is it only one signature stat? Or do you get one for each
[1:34:12] <%VyperVic> 5322 is good
[1:34:17] <@Menitta> do 1111
[1:34:18] <+Vigonept> i went 1 44 3
[1:34:18] <laguerrilha> tihs is good
[1:34:18] <rcand9> having a six makes for a fun stream to be fair
[1:34:20] <oda_flobunaga> 1111
[1:34:20] <dukenux> yea its good
[1:34:20] <LegitBarnacleBoy> 5322 is good
[1:34:20] <problemagic> that's good
[1:34:21] <overlard> Psyche is really important considering how much talking you have to do in the game
[1:34:21] <+aishman> 5 3 2 2 is good
[1:34:21] <primaryfire> psyche is very fleshed out
[1:34:21] <Iwashi94> 5322 is good
[1:34:22] <%hax_metatron> Everything is viable
[1:34:24] <MyNameIsRasus> 5322 is great
[1:34:24] <%JustToWatch> 4422 is a solid build
[1:34:24] <CappuccinoGuil> All builds are doable, mind you
[1:34:25] <nelsonsaysbooya> Just make Endurance signature
[1:34:25] <%doomerskeletor13> Looks good
[1:34:26] <+OblivionSword1> This is fine
[1:34:26] <EternalJedi> limesOk
[1:34:26] <%Darmanimon> seems good yeah
[1:34:26] <+Count_Viscount> This is a cool-ass game
[1:34:26] <brachydios777> That’s good
[1:34:29] <BoltsJ> Dump a stat
[1:34:29] <+ReallyBigRocks> Literally any build is viable
[1:34:29] <%hax_metatron> You'll just have a tailored experience
[1:34:31] <+pectusumbra> you get only 1 signature skill.
[1:34:32] <Solidnick18> that seems good
[1:34:32] <zedravan> SeemsGood
[1:34:32] <%gatorafan> STRIKE YOU FOOL! daedra1DrunkTibs
[1:34:35] <naoi0> YOur signature skill as well is a bump up
[1:34:35] <+Count_Viscount> so this'll be a fun stream
[1:34:35] <aiutare47> @SuckerPunchSyd one sig, which is a +1 and a higher cap for all of that family
[1:34:36] <FassieFons> 1111 = bumble cop
[1:34:38] <+itsgundamu> all in on intelect
[1:34:39] <problemagic> e spirit de cops
[1:34:40] <Parapattern> Thats a good way to go
[1:34:40] <+Vigonept> signature give ya a boost
[1:34:41] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Gotcha gotcha
[1:34:42] <rcand9> honestly i had a 6 in my playthrough and it was fun
[1:34:48] <Timarkot> Odd numbers don't do anything @WoolieVersus
[1:34:49] <%Darmanimon> physique?
[1:34:49] <andre11dr> I went 2442 but you definitely do you
[1:34:53] <Gomfury> you can get enough healing items to make any build valid
[1:34:54] <Electro96> signature on your secondary stat is good
[1:34:55] <+Count_Viscount> 2 hours in and still on character creation...that's Disco Elysium
[1:34:55] <%thetunnelhomer> Shivers is a good Sig
[1:34:55] <laguerrilha> yeah
[1:34:59] <%hax_metatron> Yup
[1:35:02] <jorniev> YES
[1:35:02] <Blank9> it raises the level cap on the row
[1:35:03] <laguerrilha> giving to a low stat helps a lot
[1:35:03] <nomos42> I'd say inland as another option
[1:35:03] <%hax_metatron> Give +1 to Shivers
[1:35:05] <%doomerskeletor13> Yea
[1:35:05] <$hattrick61> thats what i did
[1:35:07] <+aishman> perception is also good
[1:35:07] <jorniev> VOL BRO
[1:35:07] <Narbarec> 5322 is good. Too many playthroughs use 4422 imo
[1:35:08] <boomlessjay> Perception would be a good one.
[1:35:08] <+HumanDoctor> set up character 30 min fail state at 5 min of gameplay calling it
[1:35:09] <primaryfire> level 4 is the threshold for passing a lot of passive checks
[1:35:11] <%doomerskeletor13> Reggie with the big brain
[1:35:11] <naoi0> @Count_Viscount To be fair they spent like an hour catching up and talking to peeps
[1:35:14] <+khalcipher> Whatever you want
[1:35:15] <Gomfury> boost IE, you need 4 for the magic
[1:35:15] <@Menitta> This seems like a game that you really need to just let the dominoes fall.
[1:35:19] <+pectusumbra> raises the cap. You can commit to psyche or put the sig on something like perception
[1:35:19] <%Darmanimon> raising pan threshhold or endurance seems good
[1:35:21] <%Juriasu> big brain Reg
[1:35:21] <%VyperVic> SHIVERS GANG
[1:35:22] <problemagic> you can increase your caps in game as well
[1:35:23] <rcand9> shivers is good
[1:35:24] <aiutare47> shivers baby
[1:35:24] <+Kataguro> Shivers and Perception are both good Signatures
[1:35:25] <+Count_Viscount> @Menitta it really is
[1:35:25] <+beardy_foxbear> Shivers
[1:35:27] <tukds> woolie 4 4 2 2
[1:35:28] <+mechslayer71> It’s an individual skill
[1:35:34] <problemagic> shivers is the best brain
[1:35:34] <%commanderclaw> Shivers is fucking rad
[1:35:35] <%Darmanimon> or electro-chemistry and be a druggie cop
[1:35:37] <+regularjimmy88> Shivers
[1:35:38] <%thetunnelhomer> Shivers is cool
[1:35:38] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1381828284657324036?s=20
[1:35:38] <MyNameIsRasus> Shivers is cooler
[1:35:40] <+eldrinos> shivers is cool, but perception is strtong
[1:35:43] <nomos42> @mechslayer71 But the caps on all the row
[1:35:44] <%FallenAngelZelos> you can always buff the ones you like later too
[1:35:45] <naoi0> Toss a coin?
[1:35:50] <+OblivionSword1> both are good
[1:35:50] <laguerrilha> i did practically the same stats and went with perception as well
[1:35:53] <naoi0> ALRIGHT
[1:35:53] <problemagic> oh god yes
[1:35:54] <boomlessjay> yes, Shivers is the best,
[1:35:54] <naoi0> 'ERE WE GO
[1:35:55] <+ChubbyPencil> YEYEYEYEYEYE SHIVERS LFG
[1:35:55] <primaryfire> shivers and perception are both fantastic
[1:35:55] <squidmax1> Good goddamn choice
[1:35:56] <zanzibarian_hamster> yeyeye
[1:35:56] <andre11dr> Electro Chemistry is also pretty fun
[1:35:56] <CuttleCrow> Sig stat increases the CAP of the entire stat tree, and adds ONE point to the skill chosen
[1:35:57] <+Mendin> You Belong To The City

[2:37:38] <+LegendGHT> this game is so fucking good
[2:37:39] <Estwilde> Kim doesn't have all of these "friends" like we do
[2:37:41] <laguerrilha> i do

[2:37:54] <dukenux> i heard that its crazy
[2:37:55] <laguerrilha> wow
[2:37:55] <T_Sasquatch> we all do ....
[2:37:56] <Solidnick18> yeah
[2:37:57] <Estwilde> no inner monologue?
[2:37:57] <%Darmanimon> I hear voices in my head, they talk to me, they understand
[2:37:58] <Louie_Salmon> But they obviously think things, right?
[2:37:58] <+QueequegTheater> That's crazy
[2:37:59] <Cymen90> They do, they just do not consider them voices
[2:37:59] <dukeoftime> NPCs
[2:38:02] <@Menitta> I dont have a voice in my head. Its outside my head
[2:38:02] <+eldrinos> yeah, some people don't have an internal narrative
[2:38:03] <$jake5713> I don't think I do.
[2:38:03] <+diamondswan30> oh I can believe that
[2:38:04] <Chatterbox1991> @WoolieVersus im the same way
[2:38:05] <tetrabrick1lt> the problem is when the voices start arguing
[2:38:06] <yeeyeyee> @wolfofsound you can, there are some checks against him later basically
[2:38:07] <RWLJr98> sounds like torture to not have that
[2:38:08] <+Undenizen> everyone does, but sometimes it's not very cognizant
[2:38:08] <andre11dr> I have it big
[2:38:12] <%saladin1911> For real? I have the best conversations with myself
[2:38:12] <muXPerience> are they the NPCs? Or am I the NPC?
[2:38:13] <$dudedude55555> it's more common with people that only speak only one language
[2:38:13] <Iandrasil> it's neurologically proven as well
[2:38:15] <lilmac64> Wait, the voices arguing isn't normal?
[2:38:15] <+krispen_wa> EXTERNAL PEOPLE
[2:38:16] <andre11dr> Almost to big
[2:38:17] <+FrostedZaibatsu> I have 3 voices
[2:38:19] <%cobalt_phoenix_> interesting
[2:38:22] <heartlesshealer> dang
[2:38:23] <+QueequegTheater> Oh no, Woolie said the quiet part loud
[2:38:23] <SolSwagGuy56> REGGIE LOW CONCEPTUALIZATION
[2:38:24] <+RealThiele> chat has burned itself in there
[2:38:25] <+Doomtastic> thats damn near a mind closed off
[2:38:26] <+diamondswan30> crazy people
[2:38:26] <andre11dr> Im a talk to myself type
[2:38:27] <$emptyantics> I have 10 voices
[2:38:30] <Cymen90> Bruh, I hear myself ALL THE TIME
[2:38:31] <SomeAsianDood> The theory for schizo is that to some extent they don't recognize those voices as their own
[2:38:35] <%ZweihanderSteve> YOU KNOW THIS GAME IS GOOD IF THIS IS THE TOPIC OF CONVERSATION woolieGASM
[2:38:38] <+TheBobulus> I'm very visual, don't really have a voice
[2:38:38] <%wolfofsound> granny smith
[2:38:39] <+NoHopeForMyCuirass> I have an internal voice but no internal vision
[2:38:39] <Louie_Salmon> I hate that apple thing, I have no idea if I see it or not
[2:38:40] <egoat> this exact dialog tree is about this
[2:38:41] <aiutare47> Ive legit never head of someone without an inner monologue
[2:38:45] <+NoHopeForMyCuirass> Yeah like that,
[2:38:48] <+froduck42> Aphantasia is the term
[2:38:50] <sendart> I think of death note

[2:38:53] <Picia000123> I talk to myself and then listen to the voice, yeah
[2:38:55] <+Undenizen> the voices ARE you. they're not talking to "you", "you" are the amalgamation of your voices.
[2:38:55] <$emptyantics> Aphantasia
[2:38:56] <InXplotch> this is a bit different from the voice thing though
[2:38:57] <user_naim> real aphantasia hours

[2:39:13] <%wolfofsound> yayaya
[2:39:14] <brunoberserk> or some have GOBLINS
[2:39:16] <crimsonharvest> I have a hard time assembling the individual components into a coherent gestalt
[2:39:17] <laguerrilha> ah yes true
[2:39:22] <$emptyantics> Aphantasia is awesome
[2:39:25] <andre11dr> Indeed
[2:39:25] <+QueequegTheater> I'm thinking of a fucking apple
[2:39:26] <BlueLunecy> This is getting high level
[2:39:30] <thelivingglitch307> Woolie PhD
[2:39:31] <$jake5713> I have to force my brain to think inwardly. Everything I do feels like it's on autopilot. which means my self control is almost non-existent.
[2:39:31] <Cymen90> Oh nooo.....Woolie suffers from ART BRAIN
[2:39:32] <InXplotch> aphantasia sounds very not awesome
[2:39:34] <%Irridium> apple yummy
[2:39:35] <CappuccinoGuil> There are artists who CAN'T see the apple, it's wild.
[2:39:38] <dukenux> My visual representation isn't usually that strong, unless i focus on it
[2:39:38] <Estwilde> I'm eating an apple right now
[2:39:40] <+xerotwo> APPLE VS EPIC LUL
[2:39:43] <%saladin1911> @queequegtheater I'm thinking of fucking an apple
[2:39:43] <laguerrilha> i also had art classes and was wired like that too
[2:39:45] <NeutrinoInteraction> I can imagine something to that extent if I really concentrate on it but starting off it's like a sketch
[2:39:52] <dukenux> I kinda see a cartoon apple normally LUL
[2:39:57] <yeeyeyee> I can visualize stuff but conceptualizing relative physical space is almost impossible for me, also applies to directions and shit
[2:39:59] <WakeUpThrow> I'm having flashbacks to the IHNMAIMS LP on the old channel, loving this
[2:40:00] <+FrostedZaibatsu> Woolie is talking about a twitter post thats been spreading around people
[2:40:04] <$emptyantics> @cappuccinoguil That’s crazy, isn’t it called outsider art?
[2:40:09] <NeroInfinite> My goblins hate apple. FeelsBadMan
[2:40:12] <axelkaspar> Sapir-Whorf hypothesis?
[2:40:14] <+RealThiele> all commercial apples are clones
[2:40:17] <+cubbywolf> every baby can learn any language
[2:40:27] <%Seancicle> osez tu apprendre français
[2:40:30] <CappuccinoGuil> @emptyantics not sure. Some people just can't imagine the object, but they know how to draw it still.
[2:40:30] <%FallenAngelZelos> Yeah, so I'm American. So all I can think of is GUNZ GUNZ HAMBURGER GUNZ
[2:40:30] <laguerrilha> same
[2:40:33] <%Juriasu> my first language is swedish but I think in english A LOT, just a habit from when I learned english when I was younger
[2:40:33] <%Darmanimon> what is normal Reggie?
[2:40:35] <+krispen_wa> I HEAR VOICES IN MY HEAD
[2:40:36] <InXplotch> This concept is most interesting with people who are born deaf, because they don't have a "voice" to think with
[2:40:37] <+cubbywolf> a white NA baby adopted in china will learn chinese no problem
[2:40:40] <+krispen_wa> THEY TALK TO ME
[2:40:40] <yeeyeyee> @emptyantics outsider art is more "people with strong mental illness that prevents them from integrating into society making art"
[2:40:42] <twohitgood> my internal dialog is loud.
[2:40:43] <+krispen_wa> THEY UNDERSTAND
[2:40:44] <+QueequegTheater> ALL OF THESE VOICES INSIDE OF MY HEAD
[2:40:45] <T_Sasquatch> THEY TALK TO ME, THEY UNDERSTAND
[2:40:46] <%LCLSmoothie> as a american, i only think hamburger
[2:40:47] <tetrabrick1lt> sounds like bullshit to appear to be different
[2:40:49] <+krispen_wa> THEY TALK TO MEEEEEEEE
[2:40:52] <yeeyeyee> @emptyantics that's why it's outsider art, they're outside society
[2:41:00] <thelivingglitch307> indeed
[2:41:04] <+cubbywolf> BURN THE HOUSR RALPH. KILL EM ALL
[2:41:08] <Cymen90> Yeah, you initial language forms your way of thinking. It contributes to many differences in perception and conceptualization. Chinese leads to a different path of thinking as it is an analytical language.
[2:41:08] <Estwilde> I like lamp
[2:41:08] <DovaDude29> Woolie, Woolie your running the clock. PLease press pause
[2:41:14] <zanzibarian_hamster> When you read dialogue in your head, is it in the characters voice or the voice in your head doing that characters voice?
[2:41:24] <+mechslayer71> This is gonna be a long play through
[2:41:32] <CappuccinoGuil> @WoolieVersus remember to pause the game when you chat, there's a timer
[2:41:37] <+NoHopeForMyCuirass> @tetrabrick1lt There's a lot of semantics involved, naturally. But I will attest I see nothing in my head when I picture an apple, and people like Woolie envision all these details about it
[2:41:38] <twohitgood> pay attention to when kim pulls out his notebook
[2:41:40] <NeroInfinite> this will surpass kotor.
[2:41:41] <yeeyeyee> NO NO NO
[2:41:41] <juxtest> Kim has different game mechanics than you
[2:41:43] <$tkuwari> it's okay to run the clock on day 1 at least
[2:41:45] <%TheTyper> Time passes when you pick dialogue, you're fine
[2:41:45] <$emptyantics> @ @yeeyeyee ohh thanks I always thought outsider meant “not practiced in any art background but can still make art”
[2:41:47] <+cubbywolf> LUL
[2:41:48] <thelivingglitch307> @zanzibarian_hamster most of the time
[2:41:48] <Tisaric> the time doesn't move unless you're actually talking @WoolieVersus
[2:41:48] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @naoi0
[2:41:48] <yeeyeyee> @WoolieVersus clock doesn't advance unless you do things
[2:41:49] <TheToanon> Wow that's what they were just talking about
[2:41:49] <Electro96> the clock is not real time
[2:41:53] <+cubbywolf> ruh roh
[2:41:53] <aiutare47> @WoolieVersus Time only advances during dialogue
[2:41:54] <+krispen_wa> when i read a manga in english, i still somehow manage to hear the japanese voice actors saying it in english even if it doesnt make sense
[2:41:54] <camelwizard> Only when you talk, time doesn't move when you walk around
[2:41:55] <+QueequegTheater> Kim has to Cole Phelps
[2:41:55] <boomlessjay> time is based on actions not real time
[2:41:56] <%Javaa01> Both
[2:41:56] <laguerrilha> Time only passes when talking
[2:41:56] <Electro96> it's clicking
[2:41:56] <%Juriasu> the time mostly passes diring conversation it's almost stopped otherwise
[2:41:57] <+Mucmaster> @CappuccinoGuil it only passes when you progress you don't need to pause
[2:41:57] <+CD_Repo_Man> The time only passes when you click on options
[2:41:58] <+NoHopeForMyCuirass> Time only passes when you advance
[2:41:58] <+Kataguro> It's only when you're talking
[2:41:58] <amonimis> when you click
[2:41:59] <primaryfire> the clock only advances when you talk/examine
[2:41:59] <Tisaric> @WoolieVersus based on when you click
[2:41:59] <reonome> its only when you click
[2:41:59] <Visorak6> It passes only when you interact with things or pick dialogue @WoolieVersus
[2:41:59] <Iwashi94> it's not _that_ big of a deal
[2:42:00] <aiutare47> @WoolieVersus Click

[2:42:00] <+Arnoldoaad1> clock only advances when you speak

[2:42:01] <yeeyeyee> @WoolieVersus clock doesn't advance unless you do dialogue or press things!!!!
[2:42:02] <%Noonoox12> @WoolieVersus it's only when you click
[2:42:02] <Blank9> based on talking only
[2:42:02] <WakeUpThrow> I thought time only progressed after clicking
[2:42:02] <+Vigonept> it only affevted by actions
[2:42:03] <+pectusumbra> time passes with new dialogue

[2:42:32] <rcand9> time does stop after 4 am i think too im pretty sure
[2:42:34] <CappuccinoGuil> @Mucmaster is that specifically during conversations? Does the timer run naturally while exploring?
[2:42:34] <lilmac64> In that one guy's defense, Pat said it was real time in his stream.

[3:03:25] <%livlinn> !uptime
[3:03:25] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 18 minutes
[3:03:26] <%Javaa01> Solution becomes after after internalizing
[3:03:26] <dukenux> Harry Copper
[3:03:26] <brunoberserk> GAME IS TOO REAL
[3:03:28] <+Mucmaster> 4h20 min 420 blaze it
[3:03:34] <Louie_Salmon> "White Mourning"
[3:03:35] <+Exicuren> 4 hours and 2 mins of running the clock
[3:03:41] <yeeyeyee> there's like 70 thoughts
[3:03:41] <+Undenizen> you can have many at once
[3:03:42] <Electro96> you have 12 slots, 3 unlocked by default
[3:03:43] <+PkSilent01> Can't wait until we get Racist
[3:03:48] <oda_flobunaga> Advanced Race Theory
[3:03:50] <velgaduere> riding that 1 HP lobosKek
[3:03:50] <%Javaa01> You have 12 total slots
[3:03:52] <+krispen_wa> wait how is he only this far after 4 hours?
[3:03:52] <moonmintparadise> You choose them
[3:03:53] <+MachoMadnesss94> You can always use a skill point to un-internalize them later
[3:03:53] <user_naim> You can forget them too. For skill points
[3:03:53] <yeeyeyee> you can internalize a lot of thoughts
[3:03:55] <crimsonharvest> you can buy all those empty slots with the X in them
[3:03:58] <+TheBobulus> So there's two states: While you're internalizing (-1 comp) and then the finished state (unknown at this time)
[3:04:00] <Zap_Rowsdower32> You have a limited number of thought slots
[3:04:00] <andre11dr> Some may be ANARCHISM
[3:04:02] <linSP> Racism is later
[3:04:03] <+shootbang_exe> you also don't need to commit to a copotype as soon as one pops up
[3:04:05] <rcand9> theres soooooooooo many
[3:04:06] <+Atomic_ColliderSG> Fun fact Hobo Cop was removed from Clay Fighter 63/3 for being offense but Kung Pow was fine.
[3:04:07] <+admiral_of_crunch> ACTUAL ART DEGREE
[3:04:08] <ingman112> You start with three for free, and then you can use points to unlock new slots and forget learned thoughts
[3:04:09] <%democrazyyy> HOBO ART COP
[3:04:12] <bufflb> how far did woolie get the first time he played it?
[3:04:13] <yeeyeyee> you have 16 slots
[3:04:23] <+evbites> become capitalist fascist commie
[3:04:29] <willyfreshness> essence of hobo
[3:04:29] <naoi0> @bufflb A few hours he said, but that was back in 2019
[3:04:32] <JayEarly> @democrazyyy hell yeah brother
[3:04:36] <Pookiedaexzile> It can be taken out and put back on
[3:04:36] <CappuccinoGuil> You can internalize them and equip later. That's an equipment menu
[3:04:40] <+SignScratch> like feats in other RPGs
[3:04:43] <Oddere> I only got like 1/4 unlocked after finishing the game, theres a lot of replayability
[3:04:43] <Zap_Rowsdower32> LUL

[4:01:50] <+RealThiele> garte their own way
[4:01:51] <EnlouZalou> YOOO
[4:01:52] <dmtjinni> Badge
[4:01:53] <andre11dr> Well fuck that missing badge i guess
[4:01:59] <+Atomic_ColliderSG> don't spend it until you need it
[4:01:59] <+OblivionSword1> you should call the 41st precinct again
[4:02:02] <%doomerskeletor13> They can report the badge later
[4:02:03] <%Darmanimon> how about leveling endurance so you don't fuckin die
[4:02:07] <dds333a> what a display
[4:02:07] <jacknerik> I forget, what does half light do?
[4:02:10] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Save points until you need them?
[4:02:10] <therustystream> yeah they can report it later
[4:02:11] <primaryfire> the badge report conversation is so funny though
[4:02:12] <huskarl_zap> endurance 1 LUL
[4:02:13] <+Mucmaster> The station doesn't need to know about the missing badge I'm sure woolie will find it eventually
[4:02:13] <+QueequegTheater> AUTHORITY, SCREAM AT THOSE FILTHY PEONS
[4:02:13] <therustystream> it's so good tho
[4:02:14] <zenith0111> So is thid game about how personality traits are inalienable and you cant truly vhange yourself just experience it?
[4:02:19] <Space_Pagan> Dear lord level that endurance
[4:02:20] <+SignScratch> empathy you should level based on that call you monster
[4:02:22] <+RealThiele> the body check with 1 endurrance LUL
[4:02:24] <%doomerskeletor13> Half Light is intimidation iirc
[4:02:25] <Timarkot> @therustystream Intimidation
[4:02:26] <CuttleCrow> you are one point from death in end
[4:02:26] <overlard> @jacknerik Fight or flight instinct
[4:02:26] <$mattynezz> Reporting your badge is some juicy content
[4:02:26] <+OblivionSword1> @jacknerik fight or flight response
[4:02:28] <+theCatastrophy> Some things don't show up if you don't pass the check
[4:02:30] <jacknerik> Gotcha
[4:02:31] <primaryfire> @jacknerik your ability to feel fear when necessary or detect fear in others
[4:02:31] <Asuterisuku> LUL
[4:02:32] <andre11dr> @jacknerik Let's you sense danger
[4:02:33] <muXPerience> @zenith0111 look up the thought cabinet
[4:02:34] <aiutare47> @jacknerik Fight or flight, pick fights, scare people

[4:02:41] <%doomerskeletor13> It’s fun though
[4:02:49] <+QueequegTheater> But auth tho
[4:02:51] <Electro96> getting a skill to 4 is generally good to start hearing it more often
[4:02:52] <%CalderGaming> "RHE-toric"
[4:02:55] <aiutare47> yeah esprit is nice
[4:02:56] <Ultimatefool> How did cool guy become 0 LUL
[4:02:57] <RWLJr98> You say rhetoric wierd!
[4:02:59] <trickster721> Wait, they're still alive with a one in Endurance? That's impressive.
[4:03:00] <+NoHopeForMyCuirass> All skills are good, no skills are bad
[4:03:00] <%Javaa01> @WoolieVersus Upgrading your health stats does NOT give you a free point of health, just an increase to capacity
[4:03:04] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Your Rhetoric skill is good for right now
[4:03:05] <Space_Pagan> I'm loving this playthrough in a twisted way
[4:03:05] <zenith0111> @muxperience Will do
[4:03:06] <huskarl_zap> woolie likes the liar skill
[4:03:07] <+RealThiele> the thetoric
[4:03:15] <+za7az> @QueequegTheater You trying to get them killed? LUL
[4:03:15] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:03:16] <%DiscoMatador> Or endurance so you don't croak
[4:03:18] <andre11dr> You should get health, aka Endurance
[4:03:18] <+CD_Repo_Man> more points in a skill makes it talk more
[4:03:20] <+SignScratch> a lot of checks are hidden
[4:03:26] <Broand> If you fail you don't see it a lot of the time
[4:03:26] <primaryfire> most checks are hidden
[4:03:27] <+QueequegTheater> @za7az isn't that what we're all doing
[4:03:28] <Ids560> higher stats mean passing more passive checks
[4:03:29] <Strigiform> theres alot of hidden checks that dont show up if you fail them
[4:03:32] <Pookiedaexzile> Respect my Authority
[4:03:34] <Zap_Rowsdower32> I would put one more point in Endurance just as a buffer.
[4:03:37] <user_naim> A lot is hidden, actually
[4:03:39] <Blank9> passive checks usually don't show when they fail, so you just get more talking when you level up
[4:03:40] <+RealThiele> perception tho
[4:03:40] <Picia000123> You don't see passive checks that you failed or that were overpowered
[4:03:41] <xxMylord> you don't see fails
[4:03:42] <+coolthulhuu> pretty much everything is rolling in the background at any given time
[4:03:43] <sentientvin> beware the hidden check
[4:03:45] <+EySoyCoco> ooh he got shivers??
[4:03:45] <+za7az> @QueequegTheater psaUp
[4:03:49] <andre11dr> Woolie your almost dead
[4:03:50] <$mattynezz> you don't see failed passive checks
[4:03:53] <+admiral_of_crunch> Passive checks are invisible unless you pass them.
[4:03:55] <Jontman42> savoir faire 0 lol
[4:04:05] <+RealThiele> big bullshit artist
[4:04:05] <Mrcowabungaa> Line dem pocketssss
[4:04:10] <aiutare47> also something to consider, 5 is above average, and you dont necessarily want a skill chiming in. as youve seen
[4:04:11] <ingman112> There are failed passive checks you see, but those are rarer
[4:04:11] <+pupil31> WASDA
[4:04:13] <overlard> really should have put it into endurance considering what's coming NotLikeThis
[4:04:16] <+evbites> @RealThiele its the pants and shoes
[4:04:17] <nelsonsaysbooya> You can hold onto points until you know what you want them for

[4:32:42] <trickster721> Cock carousel is an important side mystery which has now been solved.
[4:32:44] <+Jiggisnipe> yea that's a good ability
[4:32:45] <+AnthonyJMax> into the vault
[4:32:48] <heartlesshealer> actively shove out of long-term memory is a good spoiler avoidance technique
[4:32:48] <OldManDeckardCain> ok, so woolie doesn't ever listen to pat, got it Kappa
[4:32:49] <Aussie_Manny> literally tho LUL
[4:32:49] <Chatterbox1991> No you litterally have memry leaking out your ear
[4:32:53] <reonome> dr woolie love
[4:32:54] <Aussie_Manny> good Stand ability
[4:32:55] <+brightman42> so did you enjoy red pilling that guy?
[4:32:56] <%Javaa01> @aiutare47 It's a mandatory stat to spec into if you wanna exist in the vicinity of Pat
[4:32:56] <+SignScratch> also he couldn't have know it would come out this way
[4:32:58] <+admiral_of_crunch> Woolie has an anti-spoiler firewall against Pat.
[4:33:11] <@Menitta> do we need to increase the jail slider
[4:33:12] <RWLJr98> "GONNA" ITS HAPPENING
[4:33:12] <andre11dr> Hobocop woolieGIRLS
[4:33:13] <ZE_Count> The great mystery of the cock carasol
[4:33:21] <+feign___> I feel like it would be one hand outstretched and like a circle with the other hand as you hop from finger to finger. I also don't think I should say this but I rolled snake eyes so, y'know
[4:33:21] <+ClericOfSparda> Why are people being asshats?
[4:33:26] <jorniev> do you think he will find the title card next session?
[4:33:27] <ingman112> Yeah Pat should not be spoiling any shit for you
[4:33:28] <Chatterbox1991> @andre11dr WutFace
[4:33:30] <Tracazoid> Woolie white noises his brain against spoilers, at least the best he can
[4:33:30] <user_naim> Woolie must also drink himself to an amnesiac
[4:33:35] <TrashLeviathan> is the jail slider like the intel bleep slider
[4:33:36] <+SignScratch> woolie rides the spoiler carousel
[4:33:36] <primaryfire> the alternative to hobocop is good too
[4:33:37] <%0ctaeder> damn did i missed the whole stream?
[4:33:42] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @yeeyeyee
[4:33:44] <dds333a> Sure are
[4:33:46] <CuttleCrow> the game knows
[4:33:48] <heartlesshealer> Hmmm
[4:33:49] <ronin19xx> EAT UP!
[4:33:49] <neostria> :(
[4:33:50] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Theres also a difference between hearing a spoiler and actually experiencing it
[4:33:57] <Kongro_> Streamers too
[4:33:58] <%psydaku> psydaku subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! did yall hear about ryu becoming a power ranger?
[4:33:58] <Prevot> you can say that again
[4:34:01] <%KetsuoTaberu> Imagine getting pulled over by a cop and he starts telling you about cock carousels
[4:34:02] <reonome> imagine a real-ass cop telling you about cock carousels
[4:34:03] <WakeUpThrow> Straight up tells you to go for the wacky options
[4:34:03] <primaryfire> another loading screen tip is that lines starting with "wait" or "hold on" won't advance dialogue so they're safe to pick
[4:34:04] <%livlinn> joofbSweat
[4:34:05] <Blank9> the emperor is wearing new clothes
[4:34:09] <+EySoyCoco> preach
[4:34:10] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Disco is a very real game
[4:34:10] <%KetsuoTaberu> @reonome LUL
[4:34:12] <+ttvp> good tips, I'm gonna be playing this myself soon lol
[4:34:12] <Robot_Nixon_> shungite? atpCap
[4:34:12] <%wolfofsound> bleach the virus
[4:34:14] <reonome> jinx
[4:34:17] <velgaduere> the real reason for Vergil's quest
[4:34:18] <@Menitta> yeah, I'm stupid
[4:34:23] <rcand9> what a game
[4:34:25] <zenith0111> NotLikeThis Too real
[4:34:27] <velgaduere> the REAL motivation
[4:34:29] <Timarkot> @WoolieVersus "wait" and "hold on" options will not advance dialogue
[4:34:37] <WakeUpThrow> It's pretty great, isn't it?
[4:34:39] <ZE_Count> So you guys like the writing?
[4:34:41] <Space_Pagan> good choice!
[4:34:42] <Estwilde> Yeah these decisions MATTER
[4:34:43] <%saladin1911> Probably gonna have to buy this when I get paid next week. Holy shit this game seems wild
[4:34:45] <+feign___> Reggie, your joke about rich people being learned (in this world) was great
[4:34:46] <andre11dr> @woolieversus So if you didn't really Endurance gets you health and Volition is mental health, you get more if you level them up
[4:34:52] <primaryfire> tells you about the cock carousel
[4:35:02] <babitoi> it's the best game ever made
[4:35:05] <@Menitta> This is a weirdly serious goofy game
[4:35:06] <DovaDude29> Woolie, for this game especially. Do NOT play to entertain us the viewers. Play how the two of you want to play. Don’t ruin it because of us
[4:35:07] <andre11dr> realize*
[4:35:10] <@Menitta> Like its both extremes
[4:35:25] <+feign___> @dovadude29 agreeed
[4:35:25] <Blank9> I love them showing you the modifiers to rolls
[4:35:34] <%Javaa01> Games like these are basically a once-a-decade thing
[4:35:35] <andre11dr> It's the most reactive story ever
[4:35:37] <%Javaa01> At this point
[4:35:38] <ronin19xx> Current rating digit?
[4:35:38] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Disco is the kind of game I've wanted for a long time
[4:35:39] <Pixelrida> Binoclard is part of my vocabulary now.
[4:35:40] <+feign___> it is hard to not be entertaining
[4:35:48] <Pookiedaexzile> ITs really the Next Torement
[4:35:54] <@Menitta> yoooo Taka
[4:35:55] <dukenux> Empathy check passed
