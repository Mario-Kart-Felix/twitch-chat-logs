[0:04:29] <Prevot> PT
[0:04:40] <+jiggy_snipe> you can miss the vibe and feeling when something was happening
[0:04:41] <DatAsuna> missing volumes in libraries is what broke me from the need to play games in release order
[0:04:48] <+jiggy_snipe> like you had to be there type feeling
[0:04:55] <%Irridium> shoutout to that one quakecon DOOM trailer we never got
[0:04:55] <%Futurecity10> Cheer500 hey V thanks for recommending the new bring me album. Though I only enjoyed teardrops, , obey, and the 1x1 linkin park remix. Kingslayer I’m a little mixed on. In return I would like to recommend starsets unbecoming and monster.
[0:05:01] <Bigyanno> Has Unus Annus not been mirror'd?
[0:05:02] <DatAsuna> cause when I was growing up release order was NOT AN OPTION for a buncha stuff
[0:05:06] <coffeeabomination> Whoa V with the Steve Jobs cosplay today I dig it <3
[0:05:10] <DelgotHansto> Poor everyone in Europe who had something to do in the morning and couldn't watch the stream
[0:05:11] <prime_name> Maybe not the best message to send out during this year.
[0:05:17] <%NirreMusic> I guess old time movie theaters that had actors in the theater alongside the movie if that counts
[0:05:24] <%Futurecity10> Did that cheer work?
[0:05:27] <%Livelinne> I miss the opportunity to binge watch joofbCry
[0:05:32] <+NYCrownlessKing> it would get taken down if put on youtube @Bigyanno
[0:05:40] <%emperordread> @coffeeabomination V-Jobs is a strong nickname

[0:15:25] <DatAsuna> 5 still has a apecial place in my heart but 0 is the besta all round package
[0:15:26] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule

[0:15:28] <anarchistPastry> LUL
[0:15:31] <%Javaa01> Yeah, Kiwami 1 and 2 are really great remakes, but ultimately, they're still PS2 games
[0:15:39] <Zayasu> KUZEEEEEEEEEEE
[0:15:40] <%Lion_kun> My favs are 5, Judgment and 0 but 7 is getting up there.
[0:15:42] <+jiggy_snipe> 5 has the hypest final fight
[0:15:45] <+radiosanchezz> ok but the final boss fight in 2 is one of the best
[0:15:47] <+Ward_Walker> I'm trying to figure out in my brain if a Vee, Pat and Woolie LP could ever work.

[0:15:58] <DelgotHansto> Only ever played Kiwami 1, given Pats downplaying of it I feel I have a very warped perception of the series
[0:16:05] <@Solidus_113> how about that raid on the castle chapter tho
[0:16:07] <%Lion_kun> Take a break before 3 because 3 is baaaaad.
[0:16:09] <+RootVeggie> Yakuza 7 is really great
[0:16:23] <+Mrbaconator> yakuza 7 is fucking amazing
[0:16:32] <+Dr_DangerPhD> 3 isn't bad tho?
[0:16:43] <%Javaa01> Yakuza 7 has been great so far, but yeah, don't burn yourself out
[0:16:45] <+radiosanchezz> 3 is......
[0:16:48] <+radiosanchezz> not great
[0:16:56] <Prevot> Yakuza: Like a Chunni
[0:17:01] <nmaten> 3 is rough cause its so old compared to kiwami 2
[0:17:06] <%Javaa01> And yeah, that's the canon explanation as to why Ichiban sees these RPG enemies

[0:18:28] <@Solidus_113> Atlus doesn't want ANYONE playing their games
[0:18:42] <@Solidus_113> They won't even let VTubers play Persona 3 or 4
[0:18:45] <%Lion_kun> Among Us blew up because of streaming.
[0:18:46] <%Irridium> and with twitch shitting up with DMCA would just be easier to not
[0:18:47] <+radiosanchezz> that suggests people would play anything past Kiwami 2 :/
[0:18:51] <%Feralspirit41> Atlas hates gamers
[0:19:02] <Darren716> Why did Pat stop his P5R stream?
[0:19:04] <+jiggy_snipe> with helium voices lol
[0:19:05] <Bigyanno> Atlus believes games should be played alone, in the dark, with nobody knowing that you're doing it
[0:19:06] <Prevot> Minh the GOAT
[0:19:07] <+Freeborg1997> @radiosanchezz ...good point
[0:19:16] <+yhom_tork> based minh

[0:24:30] <+jiggy_snipe> I like Woolie's way
[0:24:36] <+jiggy_snipe> very classic with a twist
[0:24:45] <Treyu000> 13 sentinels got nominated for game awards

[0:27:41] <+StooEsq> Dirty Deeds...
[0:27:44] <@akuda_bar> make your band name Hired to Kill My Wife
[0:27:45] <Shardlab> Would be funny if they tried to hire the same killer
[0:27:46] <+radiosanchezz> TDWP also had pretty good song names
[0:27:57] <Darren716> Wait did he try that before or after Dirty Deeds came out?
[0:28:09] <+radiosanchezz> Dogs Can Grow Beards All Over is still pretty ridiculous
[0:28:10] <+aragaojunior> australian death machine
[0:28:21] <%FuqBoiSlim> thats crazy

[0:28:42] <%Livelinne> woolieDATTEBAYO woolieDATTEBAYO woolieDATTEBAYO
[0:28:45] <DelgotHansto> Hey I just googled them they are totally the first result at least
[0:29:08] <ThunderSaad> @WoolieVersus Well Woolie 13 Sentinels actually got an award thank god man.
[0:29:14] <%BallerSwagBro9k> JAPAN PogChamp
[0:29:24] <Darren716> Atlus
[0:29:25] <+D00msDayDan> You know it’s good that woolie can get a cod in before playing halo 4 so he can see the influences
[0:29:26] <ThunderSaad> @WoolieVersus Sorry lemme rephrase that it got nominated
[0:29:26] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:29:27] <%Javaa01> My counter point tho: Yakuza
[0:29:31] <%Terrarp> is it Atlus tho? does Yakuza have the same restructions?
[0:29:37] <%Lion_kun> I only bought P5 because of the SBFP lp
[0:29:45] <mdkcde> they see hololive making millions in thrist money and they seethe
[0:29:54] <%Javaa01> @Terrarp Nah, you can stream everything Yakuza, Sega doesn't care
[0:29:55] <Darren716> Nah sega doesn't seem to care if you stream Yakuza
[0:29:56] <prime_name> Think about how TMS turned out
[0:30:00] <mdkcde> thirst*
[0:30:14] <+jiggy_snipe> it's mainly Atlus only, most other companies don't care including their parent
[0:30:17] <%Terrarp> But Sega owns Atlus, why are they like this then?
[0:30:34] <khalcatto> persona 2 is actually not that grindy
[0:30:35] <2deep5u> P2 isn't grindy at all, it's pretty LP friendly from what I remember
[0:30:36] <%Terrarp> seems like they'll do the same for Nocturne
[0:30:37] <+EdenOfLove> "So I maxxed out 3 confidants offscreen"
[0:30:38] <%Lion_kun> TMS was their biggest mistake. At least Despair Girls was short.
[0:30:43] <Ghostbody> Atlus acts as it's own entity

[0:34:39] <+jiggy_snipe> well covid is highly infectious and there is a flu vaccine
[0:34:41] <akman14> It will be interesting to see what will happen to other viral diseases in the coming years due to all these measures
[0:34:41] <+toastybites> @DelgotHansto the COVID numbers 2 weeks after thanksgiving in Canada seems to indicate otherwise
[0:34:44] <mdkcde> you got the good flu shot this year
[0:34:51] <isthatawolf> shhhh don't Americans we'll start trying to spread the flu because Bill Gates doesn't want us to /s

[0:36:56] <+EnlouZalou> the worst part is that here they predicted when and why covid would spike months in advanced but because our leadership here sucks ass nothing was done in preparation
[0:36:57] <isthatawolf> i'm from Boston we'll just punch the virus in the nuts, kid
[0:37:01] <+EnlouZalou> FeelsBadMan
[0:37:31] <london_flexing> Americans would need a national response (I.e. National lockdown) during thanksgiving in order for the Canadian data to be used effectively

[0:41:41] <DelgotHansto> Do that main mission before the end of the stream at least
[0:41:53] <DelgotHansto> Probably my favourite mission tbh
[0:41:58] <%AngryAsian5> Man I love this game
[0:42:20] <dots4eyes> You know they're evil if they use chemicals
[0:42:30] <+Freeborg1997> When's Halo by the way?
[0:42:33] <DelgotHansto> Its just a KSG really

[0:43:30] <dots4eyes> Big gun yeah
[0:43:38] <%FuqBoiSlim> PS4 TEXTURES OMEGALUL
[0:43:49] <ralphfromdk> How to deal with a smart gun. Shoot the user from 30 meteres away.
[0:43:59] <isthatawolf> @FuqBoiSlim they're going to have a fit regardless, its what they do lol
[0:44:02] <DelgotHansto> CoD games have some texture pop in
[0:44:08] <%CaptainPileDriver> eh, whatever, i don't expect much from the gameawards in terms of reveals, i swear to god though, if TLOU2 somehow wins ART DIRECTION i'm gonna scream
[0:44:10] <@Solidus_113> that's display not textures though.
[0:44:23] <%Javaa01> And you're running out of VRAM
[0:44:52] <maskedmustelid> Ugh, I had this game just refuse to load in some textures no matter what.
[0:45:05] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Aauwawawawawww
[0:45:18] <brachydios777> How is Blops Cold War chat?
[0:45:21] <%FuqBoiSlim> auughughhuhhuhh
[0:45:25] <dots4eyes> Just download more VRAM LUL
[0:45:25] <%CaptainPileDriver> whatever, i hope hades wins everything cause it deserves it
[0:45:30] <isthatawolf> @brachydios777 great
[0:45:42] <Stormiercashew> I'm enjoying Cold War a lot. The campaign is really nice
[0:45:43] <DelgotHansto> If I wasn't wearing glasses you could convince me this is a space battle over Genosis
[0:45:46] <isthatawolf> i only like OG codblops
[0:45:55] <andre11dr> Should i watch SEED? I kinda want to know
[0:45:56] <isthatawolf> and so its the only COD i've played in ten years

[0:46:03] <PunGuru> do a barrel roll
[0:46:07] <isthatawolf> @brachydios777 yes
[0:46:11] <%BallerSwagBro9k> NANOMACHINES SON
[0:46:15] <%CaptainPileDriver> i mean, i enjoy the newest cod, i like the multiplayer
[0:46:19] <isthatawolf> CodBlops CW actually feels beefier
[0:46:21] <%Livelinne> PewPew- A - PewPew
[0:46:23] <isthatawolf> and more real
[0:46:30] <%CaptainPileDriver> and i haven't played a cod game online since at least cod blops 2
[0:46:39] <brachydios777> That’s good to here because I love the first two Blops
[0:46:40] <DelgotHansto> Honestly not a fan of Warzone or the Multiplayer but man that Zombies is pretty good
[0:46:46] <PunGuru> use bomb wisely
[0:46:48] <isthatawolf> like you move slower, the guns feel heavier and more deadly, and the story is solid
[0:46:49] <Stormiercashew> its more COD if thats what you're looking for. I havent played COD in years so its definitely filling that void I didn't k ow I had
[0:47:08] <isthatawolf> also Woods is still the best bro
[0:47:13] <@Menitta> Halo to Call of Duty. "Ok time to reload. Thaaats a grenade"
[0:47:16] <Stormiercashew> and the zombies is top tier
[0:47:16] <%CaptainPileDriver> basically i can't stand the zombie's but like the online
[0:47:17] <brachydios777> Also the story of Blops is legitimately good
[0:47:25] <andre11dr> I might get CW just to feel the haptic feedback on the guns, if i can get a PS5
[0:47:38] <isthatawolf> @brachydios777 that's why i loved the first one
[0:47:44] <Daxalog> Best theme from ff7
[0:48:00] <DelgotHansto> The new zombies easter egg song is also top tier, Kevin Sherwood is one of the fucking best and most underrated video game musicians out there
[0:48:00] <brachydios777> @isthatawolf THE NUMBERS MASON!
[0:48:36] <isthatawolf> @brachydios777 Hudson is such an asshole in CW lol
[0:48:41] <DelgotHansto> I love how every song calls back to previous ones its tangentally related too hes a GOAT
[0:48:51] <%CaptainPileDriver> i wish i enjoyed zombies but i just cannot stand the newer stuff, glad y'all seem to enjoy it
[0:49:07] <isthatawolf> Mason and Woods are like bros and they both fckin hate Hudson and its hilarious
[0:49:22] <brachydios777> Also the connection made in the new one is definitely interesting (won’t spoil what)
[0:49:49] <isthatawolf> oh are you talking about the MW connect?
[0:49:56] <isthatawolf> because yeah that's wild
[0:50:03] <+lazysaiyajin> balst the jedi
[0:50:05] <brachydios777> Is that a spoiler?
[0:50:16] <isthatawolf> not really
[0:50:18] <%kyh9> isnt this a warcrime, to attack patients?
[0:50:22] <isthatawolf> but i still wont spoil it
[0:50:28] <isthatawolf> i also haven't finished the campaign yet
[0:50:29] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1328635387057758213?s=19
[0:50:35] <DelgotHansto> New Zombies has some appeal for the non-easter egg crowd but the stuff I consider simple is already more complicated than most WaW and BO1 stuff so I can see the dislike
[0:50:36] <%CaptainPileDriver> cod is literally a game series of warcrimes
[0:50:36] <%FuqBoiSlim> don't worry about it
[0:51:01] <isthatawolf> @CaptainPileDriver yeah but Blops makes you feel bad about it
[0:51:20] <+D00msDayDan> It’s been a decade since I played mw and mw2 and that grenade sound still triggers me every damn time
[0:51:28] <Stormiercashew> Zombie definitely is different, but the changes were easy for me to adjust to and I feel like its better imo
[0:51:40] <DatAsuna> the friendly fire rate is decreasing slowly
[0:51:58] <DelgotHansto> Zombies desperately needed innovation and I actually think they nailed it after the 4 blunders
[0:51:59] <Stormiercashew> That and the map is really cool
[0:52:01] <%CaptainPileDriver> @CaptainPileDriver not really, it's cod writing, i expect nothing but warcrimes
[0:52:15] <%FuqBoiSlim> wish one of the game over quotes was just sieg zeon
[0:52:22] <isthatawolf> it's basically america and russia trading warcrimes
[0:52:33] <isthatawolf> the Codblops CW story hinges heavily on that
[0:52:50] <%NeedlesD> NeedlesD subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months!
[0:53:11] <%CaptainPileDriver> i mean, it's that but also the writers making some american warcrimes seem less bad which isn't great, but i've been ignoring the stories since blops1
[0:53:27] <Stormiercashew> its warcrimes and warcrimes but with vodka this time
[0:53:34] <DelgotHansto> What I wouldnt give for LittleV to cover any Zombies easter egg song, they are all bangers not a bad one
[0:53:39] <DatAsuna> BlOps has always been cool stories with problematic messages
[0:53:46] <brachydios777> Didn’t Christopher Nolan write Blops 2?
[0:53:56] <DatAsuna> like the blops 2 "they hate us cause they hate us"
[0:54:14] <+Aldesso> man coldwar was dogshit. talkin about trying to catch lightning in a bottle twice
[0:54:18] <DelgotHansto> I don't remember BO2's story and im ok with that
[0:54:36] <%Reverend_Roscoe> LIAR V MILLS
[0:54:39] <DatAsuna> BO2 is a good campaign despite some of the story weirdness
[0:54:42] <isthatawolf> blops1 and blopsCW definite has some slight undertones of "your country will lie to you and use you as a puppet to secure victory"
[0:54:55] <DatAsuna> the bad end is better than most cod endings
[0:55:05] <DatAsuna> the good end is... eh about normal
[0:55:27] <DelgotHansto> I've come around to BO3 I actually like the story now, not a warcrime in sight
[0:55:29] <DelgotHansto> iirc
[0:55:43] <isthatawolf> watching COD infinite after playing Cold War is weird
[0:55:47] <DatAsuna> i do like how the nightmare AU of bo3 is like
[0:55:49] <MAX116030> you have to aim to have smart bullets to work for shotgun BTW
[0:55:49] <isthatawolf> it's like a complete disconnect
[0:56:03] <DatAsuna> "even in a zombie apocalypse we have to bomb the middle east"
[0:56:07] <@Solidus_113> no fact checking
[0:56:16] <brachydios777> We can agree Ghosts has the worst story right?
[0:56:20] <+Devil_IV_War> The only CODs I would really go back to are WW2 and AW
[0:56:24] <+Devil_IV_War> wouldnt
[0:56:29] <DelgotHansto> Bro is that actually what Nightmares is like I couldnt suffer through it
[0:56:32] <DatAsuna> i hated AW story xD
[0:56:38] <isthatawolf> haven't played it but i have a buddy who'd hard disagree about Ghosts
[0:56:42] <Stormiercashew> but ghosts has CALL OF DUTY DOG
[0:56:50] <ralphfromdk> Man, Woolies 3d sense of space is as bad as ever LUL
[0:56:50] <london_flexing> K-packs tho
[0:56:52] <DelgotHansto> At lest you get to kill Kevin Spacey
[0:56:59] <DatAsuna> Nightmare is the fem player sucked into a demonic AU where she's dealing with some demon tree spirit
[0:57:01] <+Aldesso> ghost is the only one i berver played
[0:57:05] <DatAsuna> and also zombies
[0:57:11] <DatAsuna> it's very weird
[0:57:14] <+Aldesso> never*
[0:57:18] <MAX116030> what worse chemical or bio weapon?
[0:57:19] <%BallerSwagBro9k> both
[0:57:25] <%CaptainPileDriver> both are equally as bad
[0:57:28] <DelgotHansto> I know what Nightmares is but I can't believe it goes there
[0:57:29] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:57:33] <isthatawolf> VX sticks to areas though
[0:57:45] <isthatawolf> also Neutron bombs dont damage infrastructure but kill people
[0:57:49] <DatAsuna> @delgothansto remember all the people marking out at how the AW reveal trailer was "3deep5me"?
[0:57:57] <isthatawolf> so there's a bit of nuance here but i agree with woolie for the most part
[0:58:01] <+EdenOfLove> Radioactive>biological>chemical in order of terriblness
[0:58:03] <london_flexing> Chemical waste can be remediated. Radioactive waster can't
[0:58:08] <+EdenOfLove> agreed?
[0:58:14] <DelgotHansto> @DatAsuna To be brutally honest not even slightly
[0:58:25] <DatAsuna> it was very cringe
[0:58:53] <DatAsuna> the people who thought spacey's haracter was a galaxy brain the the kinda guys who think tyler durden is a hero
[0:59:05] <DatAsuna> or say stewie griffin is their role model
[0:59:21] <DelgotHansto> Or Rick is the ideal lifestyle?
[0:59:27] <london_flexing> Tyler Durden was the hero tho wym?
[0:59:28] <DatAsuna> yeah that type
[0:59:43] <%CaptainPileDriver> WHAT ABOUT THE DEBRIS
[0:59:52] <DelgotHansto> Kevin Spacey is like comically evil in that game thats hilarious
[0:59:58] <%cobalt_phoenix_> hope the surface isn't inhabited
[0:59:59] <+EdenOfLove> @CaptainPileDriver we're over venus, its fine
[1:00:05] <%CaptainPileDriver> oooh, okay
[1:00:08] <%CaptainPileDriver> then yeah, who cares
[1:00:10] <+D00msDayDan> You can hipfire with the shield out
[1:00:11] <+EdenOfLove> venus is uninhabitable
[1:00:13] <DatAsuna> Kevin spacey declares war on the world and then THEY LET HIM LEAVE
[1:00:16] <+EdenOfLove> and never will b e
[1:00:16] <isthatawolf> yeah venus is basically a giant chemical weapon a anyway
[1:00:21] <+vaderxyz1970> WAR PROPOGANDA!
[1:00:27] <DatAsuna> the mission is called "deep execute"
[1:00:27] <%CaptainPileDriver> that's fine, fuck venus, it'll all melt
[1:00:28] <DelgotHansto> Hey dont shoot the messenger, I think
[1:00:46] <+Aldesso> @DatAsuna well its a diplomatic bulding
[1:01:06] <DelgotHansto> Reminder that war is still currently waging in Geneva and SetDef forces are still on the ground
[1:01:07] <DatAsuna> at least i assume V means the eraser
[1:01:20] <DatAsuna> told ya
[1:01:30] <ralphfromdk> What about a Little V load? LUL
[1:01:36] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[1:01:37] <%CaptainPileDriver> the fighting game nominee's for the game awards are kinda sad, like, no rival's of aether or them's fightin herds?
[1:01:41] <Arisato_II> New game called Warcrimer
[1:01:43] <brachydios777> Would this war be considered Space War 1?
[1:02:17] <DatAsuna> This mission has 2 cool things
[1:02:22] <DelgotHansto> The Space War of Independence already happened
[1:02:25] <+jiggy_snipe> why 1, are you expecting a 2?!
[1:02:32] <SpaceGuntank> correct
[1:02:34] <Arisato_II> The space war to end all space wars
[1:02:46] <Darren716> Yee
[1:02:47] <%CaptainPileDriver> oh NOOO
[1:03:06] <%CaptainPileDriver> fortnite suing apple has now reached quote levels of pain i wasn't prepared for today
[1:03:07] <MAX116030> Yeah I remember that one. Thats Sniper was Energy weapon with xray for aim, that gun was legit OP and ofcourse and ofc Arnold dual wields it
[1:03:10] <Darren716> It has a suppressor attached, you just dont see it
[1:03:12] <jorniev> internal combustion supression system?
[1:03:13] <+Devil_IV_War> whip it out
[1:03:14] <DelgotHansto> Can't wait for interstellar wars, some kind of war between stars
[1:03:16] <@Solidus_113> silencers can be built in
[1:03:17] <DatAsuna> there's no sight on that image either
[1:03:17] <+EdenOfLove> Also integral suppressors that are inside the gun
[1:03:28] <brachydios777> Movies lie their ass off about silencers
[1:03:29] <Darren716> Woolie they don't show the attachments on the screen
[1:03:31] <DatAsuna> the sprite just doesn't feature attachments
[1:03:32] <%dreadedcthulhu> repeat to urself: it's just a game, I should really just relax
[1:04:27] <DelgotHansto> Oh is this the disguise one?
[1:04:36] <+D00msDayDan> If only there was something woolie could do to see his screen better

[1:05:46] <Bigyanno> Salter? Hey I've grailed her!
[1:05:53] <DelgotHansto> 1984*
[1:06:03] <%KNYGHT87> daFuck is this??

[1:07:21] <%BallerSwagBro9k> DEF
[1:07:22] <isthatawolf> Boss, this is a sneaking mission
[1:07:23] <+Aldesso> this is such an easy stelth mission. please fuck it up woolie
[1:07:37] <%Jetzord> Stealth mission, kicks in the fucking door
[1:07:39] <%CaptainPileDriver> @CaptainPileDriver naaaah, he's acting like it's a good comparison and it's real bad.
[1:08:12] <jorniev> I dont know what that opening door mechanic was but holy shit i need it for more fps games
[1:08:28] <brachydios777> Nice
[1:08:35] <+yhom_tork> dirty terrestrials DansGame
[1:08:36] <DelgotHansto> Man earth sucks so much mars aerternum for life
[1:08:49] <MAX116030> Martians in COD if Evil still sound like Russians or Europeans
[1:08:52] <jorniev> neat
[1:08:54] <%CaptainPileDriver> i always love how no one in any video game hears the loud body plopping onto the ground
[1:09:05] <Arisato_II> Even their HuD is evil-colored
[1:09:26] <DelgotHansto> Are we the baddies? Salen Kotch: Yes
[1:09:31] <+jiggy_snipe> now it's a Hitman game Kappa
[1:09:36] <jorniev> IDTAG WEAPONS
[1:09:46] <isthatawolf> @CaptainPileDriver actual stealth games usually address that but yeah FPS stealth missions its like "hey what was that sound that sounded like 200 pounds of raw pork hitting the floor?"
[1:09:48] <jorniev> METAL GEAR
[1:09:51] <+vaderxyz1970> STAR SHIPS
[1:10:04] <brachydios777> Idtag soilders with idtag weapons
[1:10:21] <+D00msDayDan> The RFID chips would be in the uniform, which you just stole
[1:10:29] <%CaptainPileDriver> @CaptainPileDriver the only fps game where the enemies actually notice any sound period or you at all is wolfenstein
[1:10:48] <%CaptainPileDriver> at least to my knowledge
[1:10:49] <isthatawolf> @brachydios777 war has changed... infinitely
[1:10:54] <akman14> The real questing is why doesn't the crew have health sensors to see if someone is going around killing people on the ship?
[1:11:08] <isthatawolf> @akman14 woolie sus
[1:11:09] <jorniev> that was messy actually

[1:37:53] <+vaderxyz1970> @RodCU Because every country is AMERICA
[1:37:58] <RodCU> the Cinnemassacre Review of that film is great. Not really a review but is where they have a guest and talk about films they like and they discussed that film.
[1:38:00] <%Irridium> brave or they need money and it's literally the only way for them
[1:38:10] <%Livelinne> serfHmm
[1:38:14] <+yhom_tork> BUENOS AIRES WAS AN INSIDE JOB
[1:38:15] <+Aldesso> starship troopers has better veterans treatment then America?????
[1:38:16] <RodCU> You know which movie also gets better with age?? the Super Mario Bros film
[1:38:17] <DatAsuna> sometimes people confuse critiques for endorsements i.e. the most famous example being fight club
[1:38:23] <Mr_Strut> It earns you the right to vote, run for office, and reproduce
[1:38:23] <DSD24> Michael Ironside was in that movie
[1:38:30] <DelgotHansto> Gunboat Diplomacy is the only diplomacy
[1:38:35] <%Livelinne> indiea3BathroomGlock indiea3Thump

[1:39:42] <DelgotHansto> Kinda getting batmobile vibes
[1:39:55] <DelgotHansto> Way cooler than the batmobilke though
[1:40:15] <RodCU> Apparantly the only way they agreed to do teh coed shower scene was if the director was naked as well

[1:42:27] <RodCU> Does Japan still praise Paul Gilbert and Marty Friedman as their guitar gods?
[1:42:31] <DelgotHansto> worst*
[1:42:50] <DSD24> @DelgotHansto Well they are called Battlefront 1 and 2 EA on the title
[1:43:00] <RodCU> I was about to say Dobby
[1:43:02] <DSD24> But yeah still bad
[1:43:04] <%Livelinne> Marty Friedman is popular in TV
[1:43:06] <MAX116030> Japan have hundred small bars for different themes. Like you can find bar for anything. There is a bar which is theme for monk

[1:54:08] <DelgotHansto> Damn I just realised this game only has like one more stream left in it
[1:54:11] <Arisato_II> Then we nuke those planets
[1:54:15] <resloxxx> a 10 meter long fish would be crazy strong LUL the tiny ones already can pack a punch

[1:55:30] <%ECRead> bullet shrimp are cool tho, they can stay
[1:55:36] <+EdenOfLove> This space combat looks awesome but you spend WAY too much time in critical damage mode.
[1:55:51] <DelgotHansto> This shit sucks on higher difficulties
[1:55:54] <+Aldesso> @EdenOfLove only if woolie is on controls
[1:55:55] <+BrainOneOhOne> @RodCU I think it sees the unknowable horrors of the deep and protects us from them
[1:56:02] <RodCU> caaThink
[1:56:06] <DelgotHansto> Just becomes a chore when you can't tank damage
[1:56:07] <resloxxx> Woollie could give ace combat 7 another shot specially since the DLC campaign is out
[1:56:25] <%chiluzza> thats the same pylon too
[1:56:33] <brachydios777> @resloxxx Is plane vergil a thing?
[1:56:33] <%emperordread> Do you think this mode would be more fun with mechanical failures for taking heavy damage, like Mech Warrior?
[1:57:07] <DelgotHansto> I think this works better as a simple thing

[2:12:49] <%Livelinne> Wish leg drones in DS were this good indiea3Thump
[2:13:12] <teefpal> Children of A Dead Earth is basically a space combat sim like what you're talking about
[2:13:15] <SpaceGuntank> the Retribution actually killed a destroyer for you, so there is that
[2:13:52] <teefpal> Lasers and micromissles from tens of kilometers away, having to worry about delta-v, stuff like that
[2:14:05] <DelgotHansto> Hey theres more jackal sections in the main game too
[2:14:18] <teefpal> That's why it's good woolie, it's the least COD-like COD.
[2:14:33] <%SilverDevilfish> With the NOT political Cold War Kappa
[2:14:48] <fuzzy_snake> Cold war campaign pretty neat bunch of spy shit
[2:14:52] <+BrainOneOhOne> Speculation: what if the next Battlefield is a Titanfall game?
[2:14:59] <DatAsuna> i'd be interested in trying siege on PS5
[2:15:05] <SpaceGuntank> Cold Wat has a stellar campaign, but its probably the shortest one in the whole series
[2:15:11] <DelgotHansto> I do HIstory class and the Cold War is notorius for being the least political war ever
[2:15:17] <DelgotHansto> YEYEYEYEYEYYE THIS ONE IS SO GOOD
[2:15:26] <DatAsuna> This is my fave level

[2:17:59] <Mr_Strut> At least they checked
[2:18:10] <resloxxx> There is a wikipedia from close nuclear war moments

[2:18:33] <%Javaa01> Mmm, tasty unloaded textures
[2:18:35] <%Feralspirit41> something similar happened in russia. The computers thought reflections from sun spots were incoming missiles and one guy decided not to retaliate
[2:18:42] <DelgotHansto> Good ol Stanislav Petrov
[2:18:52] <DatAsuna> You might want something with high capacity
[2:18:54] <dinnydanny777> There's also the story behind 99 luftballoons
[2:19:03] <jorniev> BIG IRON
[2:19:12] <teefpal> The Russian sub one was crazy, both of the guys with the nuke keys were wanting to do it, and one guy convinced them otherwise
