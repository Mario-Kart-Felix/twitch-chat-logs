[0:03:18] <Charlie_Xmas> I love the history lesson, makes you relatable
[0:03:18] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:03:19] <%thesickestzak> I think I’m banned from talking about Quebec stuff because of the Reddit Kappa
[0:03:41] <+DovaDude29> You don’t, Hate breakfast?. Do ya Woolie?
[0:03:45] <leith_aziz> If you have to, you might as well eat mid-stream. Take a break or something
[0:03:46] <Solidnick18> that's fine if you need a break for a bite.
[0:03:49] <Charlie_Xmas> like Remember SOS Croco on Telel-Queb?
[0:03:52] <@Menitta> I kinda stopped eating breakfast for the most part
[0:04:03] <%BisoromiBear> game hangry
[0:04:11] <@Solidus_113> I can't remember the last time I actually are a breakfast
[0:04:16] <@Solidus_113> ate*
[0:04:20] <+polothegreatest> breakfast= coffee time Wowee
[0:04:22] <leith_aziz> I try to skip breakfast, but since I have studies, that's usually not a good idea
[0:04:26] <MovieHipster> Yes
[0:04:33] <stormhawk9891> Yes
[0:04:43] <MovieHipster> Balmung is THE place to be a degenerate
[0:04:45] <RushUnplugged> Balmung is sticky
[0:04:47] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> I skip breakfast, and sometimes lunch.
[0:04:47] <mrblitzstream> A light breakfast is always good like yogurt with fruit or oatmeal
[0:04:56] <@Solidus_113> Limsa is a degen hub on every server, because it's the most convenient
[0:04:58] <+TEANTACLES> why is minh talking about rping in ffxiv
[0:04:59] <RushUnplugged> Balmung leaves a mark on you that you can't wash off
[0:05:09] <%Th3SmartAlec> what?
[0:05:10] <pseudonym00> hey whats the name of the song that starts woolie's streams?
[0:05:13] <leith_aziz> WHAT? pickyPalm
[0:05:20] <leith_aziz> Oh fu*k off
[0:05:39] <MovieHipster> yeah parties of 8 people will pilot runs for you, they log in and do it for you
[0:05:44] <MovieHipster> in ff14
[0:06:09] <leith_aziz> Oh, sorry I thought it was like a raid where the face of the company would show up
[0:06:14] <leith_aziz> I missunderstood
[0:06:37] <laserbeaming> the solution is to not play WoW.
[0:06:44] <leith_aziz> Woolie, you're just describing grinding
[0:06:47] <+Jiggisnipe> mmos emulating real life
[0:06:50] <OblivionSword1> yeah if people find someway to hustle they will do it
[0:06:54] <pseudonym00> I really want that song lol
[0:07:16] <+Jiggisnipe> carrying them
[0:07:23] <MovieHipster> yeah im just saying pilot runs exist
[0:07:32] <+mechslayer71> is that not how it works in wow too?
[0:07:34] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Yeah, that's basic mmo mercenary work. Every game has something like that
[0:07:46] <MovieHipster> like the 3 ultimate raids in ffxiv you can't have someone die you need someone to pilot their acc
[0:07:46] <%Exiliator> Same as wow then?
[0:07:48] <Therusher> Yeah that's what the blizz CEO was getting flak for
[0:07:59] <%Juriasu> Juriasu subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months! Reggie vs Dark Souls is going to be really hype!
[0:08:00] <laserbeaming> Some other people do shadier stuff. Involve either real money or touching your account.
[0:08:00] <Therusher> err not blizz ceo
[0:08:11] <leith_aziz> Is that something new? How is Blizzard involved in that?
[0:08:35] <sendart> dirty gil
[0:08:36] <OblivionSword1> from goldfamers account
[0:08:45] <OblivionSword1> gilfarmers in this case
[0:08:57] <Charlie_Xmas> How very Glib
[0:08:58] <leith_aziz> I think I need to actually play an MMO to understand this process
[0:09:13] <+CalderGaming> Minh complicit in gil laundering confirmed
[0:09:19] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[0:09:33] <+polothegreatest> mmo IS work WubTF
[0:09:35] <OblivionSword1> @leith_aziz well FFXIV is free
[0:09:38] <+CalderGaming> Kappa
[0:09:42] <+Jiggisnipe> mmos are jobs
[0:09:45] <leith_aziz> In my head, I've understood it as if you played a GTA online mission and killed the player so that he doesnt screw it up
[0:09:50] <laserbeaming> @leith_aziz save yourself the trouble and don't. No MMO is worth anyone's time.
[0:10:01] <leith_aziz> If I missunderstood, feel free to correct me
[0:10:11] <@Solidus_113> FF14 is an JRPG first and MMO second, it's still got a great story worth playing
[0:10:14] <+Jiggisnipe> well he personally profits from his company's shit raid design
[0:10:16] <pseudonym00> Whats the stream intro music?
[0:10:19] <sendart> the wow token is what really makes it fucked up
[0:10:19] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:10:21] <FlowLethal> im doing stream donate plz pepega
[0:10:27] <FlowLethal> ceo doing that
[0:10:38] <leith_aziz> @Solidus_113 The issue with 14 is that I've NEVER played any FF game
[0:10:46] <user_naim> wait we’re doing this today?
[0:10:50] <user_naim> damn
[0:10:57] <%Exiliator> Playing economy in games can be really fun
[0:11:14] <OblivionSword1> @Solidus_113 Just like any other FF game you don't need to play other game in the series
[0:11:16] <leith_aziz> @Exiliator Half of mobile games are built on that
[0:11:27] <sendart> or just balance the damage numbers so buffs arent needed
[0:12:17] <+セビー> Expendables create an economic environment where others can participate outside of raids or conventional grinding
[0:12:22] <%cobalt_phoenix_> from my experience in ffxiv you don't neeeed much gil, mostly on teleporting and some gear. potions are not needed in most content, and food is really only needed in high end stuff or for extra 3% xp
[0:12:26] <+セビー> Its another layer of engagement
[0:12:26] <OblivionSword1> @leith_aziz FFXIV is it's own contained story just like any other FF game
[0:12:26] <BlackermanZX> I had my fun doin economy stuff in Ragnarok
[0:12:31] <+Jiggisnipe> lol
[0:12:36] <leith_aziz> @Solidus_113 It's less about keeping up, but I tend to save money unless its a product I've seen enough footage from and wanna buy. I dont know too much about 14 or MMOs. But thanks for recommending
[0:12:48] <%cobalt_phoenix_> you don't really need consumables, and healing is done by healers
[0:12:50] <+セビー> and engagement = log ins = subs
[0:13:12] <OblivionSword1> consumables in FFXIV is not that much important
[0:13:20] <leith_aziz> I play RPG's but I usually try to not use items. They're usually not needed
[0:13:24] <BlackermanZX> but i dont want to use my 99 elixirs tho
[0:13:24] <+Jiggisnipe> Woolie's mind goblins Kappa
[0:13:28] <OblivionSword1> it's mostly very small buffs
[0:13:33] <+セビー> my experience is from needing food in ffxi, lol
[0:13:44] <+Jiggisnipe> I never use megalixers
[0:13:48] <Speckster42> FFXIV is free until lvl 60 tho
[0:13:49] <%Juriasu> you also never did need them exactly
[0:13:52] <PenGia> It's like 10% bonus stats for a hard fight, not like replacing major raid buffs entirely
[0:13:57] <OblivionSword1> I mostly use food item for the exp
[0:14:01] <laserbeaming> Estus works because all damage in the game is avoidable
[0:14:02] <%Th3SmartAlec> you mean... like a RPG?
[0:14:05] <Qu1ckyyy> you held on to them until the final boss lul and even then you kept using the medicines
[0:14:05] <ThisIsLloyd> ever since cave story I never use heal items unless I'm actually forced to
[0:14:10] <leith_aziz> Im just a guy who loves collecting stuff so that I dont need to backtrack to get rewards. When I played the Uncharted series, I watched a guide on how to get every treasure. I SPOILED myself to just know where they are
[0:14:29] <leith_aziz> I think that actually was not a smart decision, as it hampers the experience
[0:15:39] <BlackermanZX> hoarding vital stars
[0:15:40] <%Prevot> yeah but grinding for consumables is shit too
[0:15:49] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[0:15:49] <leith_aziz> I guess its less about utillity, and wanting to 100% a level so that you dont feel the need to go back to it. It depends on if Im gonna play the game in one playthroughg
[0:16:01] <@Solidus_113> I have like 200 of tank and healer raid food
[0:16:20] <%Juriasu> because everything mmo's do is meant to take time
[0:16:22] <Sleix_> life gems were op as fuck
[0:16:23] <+セビー> if a consumable means the difference between wasting time on a wiped run or not, its worth the time upfront
[0:16:35] <+セビー> just do the prep work
[0:16:38] <leith_aziz> That's called grinding
[0:16:44] <+Jiggisnipe> x-potions Kappa
[0:16:54] <OblivionSword1> or to fix mistakes a little bit
[0:16:57] <+Shishi1205> buy big life gems face tank everything
[0:17:00] <leith_aziz> You intentionally grind teh game so that you dont have to deal with when things get too hardf
[0:17:05] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> So Woolie is just explaining why he doesn't like mmo's without saying that he doesn't like mmo's?
[0:17:16] <IzanagiNoOokami> Just eat the dang potion.
[0:17:17] <user_naim> Don’t talk to me or my 99 Radiant Lifegems ever again!
[0:17:18] <%Exiliator> Is it even an option at that point tho?

[0:18:14] <+Shishi1205> sharper glass cannon
[0:18:16] <+Jiggisnipe> this isn't the only reason he doesn't like mmos, in fact, he just learned about the consumables thing yesterday
[0:18:25] <laserbeaming> You never make up for your shortcomings. You specialize and accept your weaknesses
[0:18:33] <robobeau> Obliterate mind goblins by democratizing consumables. 1 donation = 1 consumable spent, no exceptions
[0:18:44] <%Prevot> yeah but MH has a farm that just gives you all the items with no effort
[0:18:48] <leith_aziz> @Jiggisnipe Who said he doesnt like MMOs?
[0:18:49] <+Shishi1205> Thats why farms exist in monhun
[0:18:53] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> ah, the omnicrafter
[0:18:57] <%cobalt_phoenix_> raiding is super optional
[0:18:57] <%Prevot> it's not too different from Estus
[0:18:58] <Charlie_Xmas> I don't raid, I play music with my bard for hours
[0:19:00] <haisho> some people just play Mahjong in FF14
[0:19:00] <+セビー> mmo’s are like mh getting super stretched out
[0:19:01] <@Solidus_113> Some people don't even play the story
[0:19:04] <OblivionSword1> some people only play FFXIV for the story
[0:19:05] <+Shishi1205> or you wait for the discounts and buy in 999 stacks
[0:19:14] <+polothegreatest> PVE is my jam, crafting my gaem
[0:19:23] <+Jiggisnipe> @Jiggisnipe someone above me but he said he doesn't like mmos on the podcast yesterday
[0:19:24] <%cobalt_phoenix_> some people just dance in one spot all day
[0:19:35] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Woolie, there's an FC that does Fightcade Netplay Tourneys for in game currency

[0:20:53] <NeroInfinite> There is a game calle Dshoppe Keep where you're a medival shop keeper.
[0:21:04] <leith_aziz> Is FFXIV the only major MMO around considering what happpened to WoW?
[0:21:16] <BlackermanZX> Merchant Class in RO was crazy
[0:21:18] <C_Apostrophe> !uptime
[0:21:19] <@Moobot> @C_Apostrophe WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 31 minutes and 32 seconds
[0:21:20] <Charlie_Xmas> define Major?
[0:21:24] <+Jiggisnipe> I think ESO is decently popular
[0:21:24] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @leith_aziz kinda? idk what the consensus on black dessert is
[0:21:34] <leith_aziz> How Woolie's feeling is basically how Max reacts to people like me who enjoy RPG games
[0:21:37] <Solidnick18> yeah i seen that
[0:21:39] <+polothegreatest> warframe covers guitar
[0:21:41] <+HollowMan190> Sickoes
[0:21:49] <Charlie_Xmas> Swtor is an MMO, Champions IMO is great for character design, Blade & souls was fun for a while
[0:21:50] <%Prevot> SourPls
[0:21:51] <Mrthatawesome> I wonder if woolie would enjoy an mmo-like game like destiny or warframe
[0:21:58] <+セビー> the drip feed of progress is addictive, whether its gear, levels, abilties or w/e
[0:22:08] <@Solidus_113> Songbirds are great
[0:22:09] <leith_aziz> Im asking because I havent kept up with MMO scene
[0:22:13] <Solidnick18> LUL
[0:22:17] <Charlie_Xmas> I use the Bard music player and Edit my own MIDI to play things different from other bards
[0:22:23] <Darkdrill> there great
[0:22:29] <arizenarkana> It helps when the single player content is strong enough that you can still have fun without engaging with any of the multiplayer features.
[0:22:29] <%thesickestzak> I like when my numbers go up in RPGs woolieGASM
[0:22:32] <OblivionSword1> for the most part WoW's competition are mostly FFXIV and ESO

[4:01:03] <shadowcrisis> with the amount of heat protruding from Reggie's body, I can fry an egg
[4:01:08] <+Damie904> @nelsonsaysbooya Yea he broke it.
[4:01:12] <+samuraiknack> So what other board games can help produce salt for this party?
[4:01:17] <+Shishi1205> @nelsonsaysbooya Yeah he said fuck it and killed reggie took his shield
[4:01:18] <viewtifulr> @nelsonsaysbooya Mihn said he was the devil and went for the kill
[4:01:22] <%Th3SmartAlec> @nelsonsaysbooya he did not. and he could have easily upheld it and killed him anyway
[4:01:26] <nelsonsaysbooya> @nelsonsaysbooya Wow, such dishonor from the Dokage
[4:01:28] <+DovaDude29> @nelsonsaysbooya it was a fine print kind of deal. Reggie got tricked in the finer details of the deal

[4:02:37] <Shwepie> Monopoly would actively reduce the salt content.
[4:02:42] <nelsonsaysbooya> I'd still really love to see a tableords with them trying to get through Kindgom Death Monster again
[4:02:45] <%Th3SmartAlec> Use Mystery if you ain't gonna sell it
[4:02:46] <+Aniki_Tony> Bruh I've been doing my grind i appreciate the comments tho. Gonna go back and rewatch
[4:02:48] <Lancaster_H> monopoly is a garbage game
[4:02:53] <+Shishi1205> leave rovid behind and take the adjacent towns

[4:13:51] <alroy909> to be honest, if you play dokapon you want to suffer. so all three of them must writhe in pain
[4:14:07] <NoviceArtist4090> Used to give you Super Spinner
[4:14:31] <dds333a> @alroy909 otherwise, can you even say they truly played it? LUL
[4:14:32] <+samuraiknack> Are we really watching Dokapon if no one suffers?

[4:15:52] <OldManDeckardCain> woolie is still probably safe because of his speed
[4:15:54] <DigiDom> That would be rough mid fight
[4:15:54] <glass_marcus> you can go to a shop and sell EVERYTHING
[4:15:54] <goose_coward> my god
[4:16:09] <viewtifulr> take it off his person with force
[4:16:12] <FlowLethal> You can force someone to go darkling
[4:16:16] <Shwepie> @sendart No, this is the ultimate party game.
[4:16:18] <RyuuAoi> One whole turn I'd say
[4:16:34] <user_naim> Might just be movement
[4:16:47] <OldManDeckardCain> use puppet on woolie just to use mystery LUL
[4:17:00] <JetpackMcQuack> mind control sucks
[4:17:02] <+terry_quest> still has to hit though no?
[4:17:04] <user_naim> But yeah, Woolie brings Dokapon upon himself again
[4:17:07] <Shwepie> I wonder if this can be used right before engaging in combat with someone.
[4:17:43] <user_naim> @oldmandeckardcain he already got +3 to stats by using the mystery, right?
[4:17:55] <OldManDeckardCain> oh I missed that then

[4:49:36] <+TitaniumDragoonNeo> Reggie is so mad that he's not a maniacal genius like Woolie.
[4:49:39] <Archmortal> is the implication that Woolie thought he had psychic powers
[4:49:41] <%insomniacCoder> i was in the bathroom, what did wollie say?
