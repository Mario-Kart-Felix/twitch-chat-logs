[0:02:39] <theognightcrawler> I need the title of the remix
[0:02:43] <%mattwillpost> Turns out Just Chatting is the name of the newest brawler sweeping the nation
[0:02:43] <Twon_From_Wakanda> Tbh what could it be?? Did something happen recently?
[0:02:58] <%JustYudha> What's up everyone
[0:03:00] <Artoo_The_Me> ‚ÄúWoolie dies on too many pies‚Äù
[0:03:02] <+b_aleph> time to YEEE
[0:03:06] <ballpoint_ren> Stop assuming the worst
[0:03:10] <aiutare47> Is this the little pre-show segment he was talking about doing?

[0:03:46] <%Livelinne> chatting with Woolz? woolieMINHMAX Chatting with Woolz! woolieKICKDAD
[0:03:51] <+SirThuggington> In all reality, he probably just wanna chill with us for a bit before putting something big on
[0:04:07] <YakumoYomi> I imagine just the GIFG "Pre-Show"
[0:04:11] <youngking_kush> We need Futaba as lofi hip-hop girl for this track
[0:04:30] <Twon_From_Wakanda> Woolie: long story short, Reggie and Lil V are no longer friends
[0:04:39] <%RyTYoung> @twon_from_wakanda DINNY
[0:04:41] <YakumoYomi> Futaba not being playable in Strikers is a missed opportunity
[0:05:02] <ainda_> i bet Hellish Quart just doesn't have a twitch category yet lol
[0:05:08] <+SirThuggington> I want Woolie to deliver all my bad news
[0:05:21] <%RyTYoung> @yakumoyomi Does she do anything gameplay wise? Not gotten far in yet
[0:05:24] <+b_aleph> @Twon_From_Wakanda I guess the point of the channel is that this would mean absolutely nothing in terms of content
[0:05:24] <+SirThuggington> ‚ÄúLong story short, you and life will no longer be friends‚Äù
[0:05:39] <youngking_kush> I‚Äôd really like to see Woolie play RDR2
[0:05:41] <aiutare47> @sirthuggington ‚ÄúI‚Äômma be real with you, mommy and daddy are no longer friends‚Äù
[0:05:56] <YakumoYomi> I'm not that far either. So far, she just shows up to hack terminals and you have to defend her
[0:06:05] <Twon_From_Wakanda> We having fun yet LUL
[0:06:12] <Qualityhugeweeb> *futsal shuffle siivwgunner mashup begins*
[0:06:32] <%RyTYoung> @yakumoyomi that's a shame, I thought she would've given your party buffs like in P5

[0:07:48] <+worldbrand> howdy
[0:07:55] <+SirThuggington> Woolie playing Dragon‚Äôs Dogma would be sick
[0:07:56] <youngking_kush> @shapeforn DD2 is supposed to be in the works
[0:08:02] <Twon_From_Wakanda> Idk I‚Äôm loving the Rider on Rider fights

[0:08:35] <+castle_ssbu> I never get tired of this intro

[0:08:55] <Qualityhugeweeb> yeah i mean idk the fights are neat but Saber's story and characters are ResidentSleeper

[0:09:02] <DaKnightWarrior> lytMOTIVATED
[0:09:03] <YakumoYomi> Mike Z died so Skullgirls could live. Arguably, nothing of value was lost.
[0:09:05] <%Livelinne> While last streaming of DS was going, I felt asleep (not from boredom but timezones) and had a weirdly realistic dream. Woolie and Reggie were still playing soulslike, but in a half-VR/theme park like environment.
[0:09:07] <StarlitStunner> stripStare

[0:11:58] <@Menitta> lmao
[0:12:07] <%Josef_Stryker> What are your thoughts on Mirror Matches? You enjoy them or are you worry about your balls being exposed?
[0:12:09] <+Deko_> pokemon
[0:12:13] <%ggbhtg> Fiscal Quarters BAYBEE
[0:12:14] <@Menitta> Dont worry about it
[0:12:19] <@Menitta> Just dont worry about it
[0:12:23] <YakumoYomi> Come, now. The DP remakes don't look THAT bad.
[0:12:24] <cj_art> why do pokemon fans hate pokemon
[0:12:26] <DianaTheAscian> Pokeball durability
[0:12:27] <%Livelinne> CHIBI MAD
[0:12:29] <%mousesorcerer> LUL
[0:12:30] <+shapeforn> I've never been so happy to not play Pokemon games lmao
[0:12:31] <+BioHunter> babys gonna baby
[0:12:33] <suckmartinez> because pokemon sucks lol
[0:12:36] <xUrbanCarnage> They‚Äôre always upset
[0:12:38] <Vaunno> chibi style is meh, but nobody will ever be happy anyway
[0:12:38] <jonasislike> Have fun with your nenedroids Pok√©mon fans LUL
[0:12:43] <xUrbanCarnage> Fuckin crybabies
[0:12:43] <%JustToWatch> ALL THE RICHES OF HEAVEN
[0:12:44] <armchairmaster_> Guess what? Pokemon is a bad franchise, and has been for several years now, who knew?
[0:12:45] <zakor1138> Nobody hates Pok√©mon more than Pok√©mon fans
[0:12:46] <+KillMyPast> Gamefreak refuses to put money into Pokemon games
[0:12:47] <%wibbwobbler> im actually super excited lmao
[0:12:49] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[0:12:51] <Twon_From_Wakanda> Only the old heads are upset
[0:12:54] <+SirThuggington> I love that tier list
[0:12:55] <Vaunno> legends looks C O O L tho
[0:12:55] <+NYCrownlessKing> whats the tier list of people that wanna fuck their pokemon
[0:12:55] <+ZarikGamingStreams> that's apt
[0:12:57] <+Deko_> smol dawn is the best
[0:13:00] <+Saamurye> LUL
[0:13:01] <LordOfThePoultry> true LUL
[0:13:01] <suckmartinez> I think itd be hilarious if only the player characters were dumb chibis and everyone else was an actual human
[0:13:02] <%ggbhtg> Game Freak makes tons of bank, doesn't put it IN their games, basically Reggie
[0:13:07] <@Menitta> legends looks cool
[0:13:08] <Livelinne> they're crying every time and then crying even harder
[0:13:12] <Vaunno> smol dawn memes at least are great
[0:13:14] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Me; as a F-Zero fan, The dead do not trouble the living...
[0:13:14] <+BioHunter> dont worry, theyll still buy it
[0:13:14] <YakumoYomi> @KillMyPast To be fair, that's probably more on The Pokemon Company than GameFreak
[0:13:14] <@Menitta> Interested in Legends hard
[0:13:16] <xUrbanCarnage> Those two games they announced look fun enough as someone who doesn‚Äôt play those
[0:13:20] <rameiramaster> Thank god I don't care about Pokemon so I can laught at all the memes
[0:13:24] <xUrbanCarnage> Sounds like babies being babies
[0:13:29] <Second_Omega> Legends looks great, and I haven‚Äôt cared since Heart Gold
[0:13:38] <%ggbhtg> Frame rate is hella sus tho
[0:13:39] <@Menitta> Not a fan of the DP remake visuals.
[0:13:42] <youngking_kush> Pok√©mon peaked at Emerald
[0:13:43] <%zanzibar_junker> You should make Reggie play the Nn
[0:13:46] <@Menitta> But Legends looks cool
[0:13:46] <+BioHunter> legends looks like a great first step
[0:13:47] <lazerscraper> "Baby-" - Sammie, Kiss Me Thru The Phone
[0:13:50] <+KillMyPast> No one trusts Gamefreak
[0:13:51] <Vaunno> pokemon should be like botw *monkey's paw curls*
[0:13:51] <+xenox997> You can never make the pokemon fandom happy. The lighting in Arceus needs to be slighty better but otherwise looks great
[0:13:53] <%zanzibar_junker> Ghost and Goblins
[0:13:55] <DianaTheAscian> Looks kinda rough
[0:13:57] <xUrbanCarnage> Boohoo
[0:14:00] <suckmartinez> Ill probably play legends, it looks like a game that is different for once
[0:14:01] <+Dova573> I dont get why people wanted a sinnoh remake
[0:14:02] <+shapeforn> I would play another pokemon game if it had a new combat system, like those one ds games
[0:14:03] <+worldbrand> as a splatoon fan i feel like the youngest child who nintendo loves the most
[0:14:08] <lazerscraper> STRIVE IS DRUGS
[0:14:10] <+Deko_> GIVE IT BACK
[0:14:10] <puluxor> I'm not mad about Arceus, I just think the DP remake's artstyle is revolting
[0:14:10] <YakumoYomi> Legends seems interesting, performance issues aside. But GameFreak at the helm of what looks like an open world game has me...worried.
[0:14:11] <armchairmaster_> It took them AGES to finally make an actual 3D Pokemon game, but still haven't made the core game fun...
[0:14:14] <+b_aleph> DTRIVE MY BALLS MOMMY
[0:14:18] <%Sparkseid> I MISS IT
[0:14:20] <+b_aleph> STRIVE*
[0:14:20] <+Dova573> I remember platinum being kinda meh
[0:14:24] <%CptnCampy61> Over here scratchin
[0:14:25] <%Josef_Stryker> LUL
[0:14:26] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @They_Call_Me_The_Fizz
[0:14:26] <Vaunno> strive feevah, strive feevaah
[0:14:30] <%ggbhtg> With his hand on the screen, longingly
[0:14:30] <+SirThuggington> Splatoon has been getting it fairly nice too
[0:14:34] <+eanscrale> Little over a month my man
[0:14:40] <xUrbanCarnage> @woolieversus I miss my drugs
[0:14:41] <They_Call_Me_The_Fizz> Sorry...
[0:14:44] <leith_aziz> I cant play an FG till Strive comes out
[0:14:45] <@Menitta> Strive beta did not feel like a beta. It felt like "Strive is here" and then it was gone
[0:14:46] <tsund3> when that game comes out i am never going outside again
[0:14:47] <%ggbhtg> "Beta period is over, yo" doodSad
[0:14:47] <%zanzibar_junker> Ryu finally not shit in SFV
[0:14:58] <lazerscraper> damn we down bad, thats what rollback does to us
[0:14:59] <+o_almighty_1> What do we do now without Strive?
[0:14:59] <DianaTheAscian> Oh god Woolie don't hurt me
[0:15:00] <Arek_1> Can't wait to see what good mechanic will be omitted in this Pok√©mon title. LUL
[0:15:02] <%Sparkseid> @menitta 100%
[0:15:08] <leith_aziz> Strive is SO GOOD. Good netcode AND its fun
[0:15:13] <%gunslinger_xxiv> Damn it's already March?
[0:15:17] <suckmartinez> i was too late on the Nago-Train and missed the beta NotLikeThis
[0:15:18] <YakumoYomi> I stared it from afar, so it hasn't hit me as hard as others
[0:15:19] <leith_aziz> Just wish lobby was good
[0:15:25] <Vaunno> @Arek_1 legends is ATB instead of turn based lol, so there ya go
[0:15:26] <@Menitta> Strive is going to be THE fighting game for a while.
[0:15:28] <armchairmaster_> @gunslinger_xxiv Lousy Smarch weather!
[0:15:33] <DianaTheAscian> it nice that the game itself is good
[0:15:45] <%zanzibar_junker> I wish Axl had his old movelist instead of timestop
[0:15:47] <leith_aziz> For a 1.0 version its suprisingly good
[0:15:58] <spinbel> "somehwat"
[0:15:59] <+b_aleph> Simple doesn't mean bad
[0:16:00] <leith_aziz> Theres still some new depth
[0:16:04] <%ggbhtg> Feelings = Caught
[0:16:06] <leith_aziz> New RC for example
[0:16:09] <MKII> i-no's dash looks like it's gonna break Strive
[0:16:10] <suckmartinez> why are devs so against putting rollback into their games? I know its a problem with japanese devs
[0:16:12] <%megaman_sentinel> so there shouldn't be no more excuses from other games not to do better
[0:16:15] <leith_aziz> And IBFD
[0:16:15] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:16:20] <%zanzibar_junker> Time stop is just useless
[0:16:33] <DianaTheAscian> If the game was just okay but online worked I still would have played it
[0:16:37] <leith_aziz> The "One more" syndrome
[0:16:48] <WG101> @suckmartinez probably because JP internet isn't as terrible compared to US internet. not 100% sure on that
[0:16:51] <%LastHazzerd> the GG:Strive Withdrawls
[0:16:57] <+Fenrein> Imo every fighting game has a honeymoon period and that‚Äôs what people are getting with Strive rn
[0:16:57] <%Sparkseid> run EVERYTHING back
[0:17:02] <YakumoYomi> @suckmartinez Aside from the "not made here" mentality, rollback is harder to implement than delay-based.
[0:17:16] <+Fenrein> The real question is how it‚Äôll develop over time
[0:17:16] <Vaunno> I hope the GG excitement doesn't fizzle out and kill it post launch (especially on pc...)
[0:17:17] <suckmartinez> gotcha thanks lads
[0:17:19] <leith_aziz> I hope Strive retains a good amount of people
[0:17:24] <%LastHazzerd> well capcom and Bamco shit the bed, so
[0:17:28] <+CheshireP> When does strive launch?
[0:17:30] <leith_aziz> Please keep its players
[0:17:33] <DianaTheAscian> That city stage is incredible
[0:17:35] <leith_aziz> 9th April
[0:17:37] <Vaunno> april 9
[0:17:39] <%ggbhtg> DRAG THEM INTO THE 21ST CENTURY, huh?
[0:17:44] <N8strength> I just saw the Post Malone Virtual Concert For Pokemon.... kinda hype but cringe
[0:17:44] <Broand> I'm gonna give axl a go

[0:18:38] <leith_aziz> We actually nerver said it right
[0:18:50] <DaKnightWarrior> So glad Ryu is good again! he's alot of fun.
[0:18:51] <+xenox997> I need to bleach RaiYU from my memory.
[0:18:54] <+Graxe_> Friendship ended with Ryu, now Rai-yu is my best friend
[0:18:56] <leith_aziz> lol

[0:19:26] <%megaman_sentinel> how do I fuk over the main character lol
[0:19:28] <leith_aziz> Since they'll have to wait anyway
[0:19:36] <%RyTYoung> Nita HEE
[0:19:36] <+eanscrale> It's like when they put Johnny in xrd
[0:19:37] <+SirThuggington> Leaving SFV on a good note
[0:19:38] <%ggbhtg> He absorbed the Fortnite guns INTO HIS BODY
[0:19:38] <Vaunno> capcom's biggest franchises kinda fire rn
[0:19:39] <+Deko_> V trigger is the minigun

[0:20:10] <enerkaizer> still wondering why they didn't choose Megaman instead of Ryu to be honest LUL
[0:20:10] <theognightcrawler> Ryu from streets
[0:20:11] <%Enemy_In_Disguise> Actually Ryu
[0:20:17] <+SirThuggington> Off camera, each match, Ryu downs a big gulp of chug jug juice before his intro
[0:20:18] <suckmartinez> It was a player called Ryu Player who, when he won said "Give my money to the homeless or something"
[0:20:21] <rameiramaster> It's Reggie looks at him smilling
[0:20:26] <AmericanaRed> PAT

[0:21:05] <Qualityhugeweeb> bromiesexual
[0:21:05] <@Menitta> V shift is weird
[0:21:07] <DeathByPoke7> DSP Kappa
[0:21:10] <leith_aziz> They fused into Rellie
[0:21:14] <suckmartinez> "ill tell you right now my love" *chu*
[0:21:21] <leith_aziz> Or Woogie
[0:21:22] <DrivenDust> Just like in my favourite fanfictions :O
[0:21:33] <ShortAssRibs> Yooooo
[0:21:34] <+b_aleph> Woogie is the superior fusion
[0:21:40] <%wibbwobbler> ryu lol
[0:21:41] <%jaggstar2020> Isn't the main character Dan?
[0:21:42] <Qualityhugeweeb> Woogie Blue
[0:21:42] <Arek_1> S,HP is now always special cancelable.
[0:21:43] <%Jumpie8> Jumpie8 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 27 months! woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE
[0:21:45] <suckmartinez> boogie woogie
[0:21:50] <Vaunno> boogie woogie strive fever
[0:21:54] <leith_aziz> Woogie blue
[0:21:56] <%ggbhtg> Right before the V-Shift patch, I was hearing about him being in his own DEDICATED, BOTTOM tier
[0:21:57] <ShortAssRibs> So, when Dark Souls? Kappa
[0:22:00] <%ggbhtg> so this is great
[0:22:13] <suckmartinez> my favorite final fantasy creature is a woogle
[0:22:27] <leith_aziz> Was Ryu worse than Alex and Juri before ?
[0:22:33] <GeoffGeofreed> Bloodborne when hehe
[0:22:35] <leith_aziz> Damn
[0:22:44] <@Menitta> I never looked at the patch notes but when I touched Ryu I did notice he was better
[0:22:51] <%ggbhtg> I repeat, I saw this man in a bottom tier of his OWN @leith_aziz
[0:23:01] <leith_aziz> Chack Bafl's video for Ryu's changes
[0:23:14] <leith_aziz> Check
[0:23:32] <yousayyugi> God old "Rayu" its coming back slow and steady
[0:23:33] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:23:56] <striderzer0> and he still has the vt2 parry
[0:24:06] <DeathByPoke7> and we got sf4 corner combos
[0:24:18] <striderzer0> hugo
[0:24:29] <%wibbwobbler> catching him up is a great way to describe it
[0:24:35] <leith_aziz> You mean G ?
[0:24:50] <%ggbhtg> "Tokido, Mago and Gachikun also combined their lists into one joint power ranking with 12 levels of separation where Ryu sits alone at the bottom in J tier"
[0:24:53] <%ggbhtg> Oooooooooooof
[0:25:00] <striderzer0> @leith_aziz he was talking about 3S
[0:25:10] <leith_aziz> Ah
[0:25:19] <%ggbhtg> now this man is in SSJ tier LUL
[0:25:45] <@Menitta> Could you not wallbounce mid stage before?
[0:25:55] <@Menitta> with donkey kick
[0:25:57] <leith_aziz> Donkey kick coul√∂d before
[0:25:58] <striderzer0> ryu got them stonks
[0:26:06] <scrublord009> Ryu is a threat now
[0:26:18] <leith_aziz> If you EX-ed i
[0:26:20] <leith_aziz> it
[0:26:31] <leith_aziz> Is he top tier ?
[0:26:37] <scrublord009> Nah man. He is mid
[0:26:40] <DeathByPoke7> he needs it
[0:26:45] <WG101> he IS the rest of the game
[0:26:56] <leith_aziz> High probably
[0:26:58] <TigerClaws12> *Dan enters the chat*
[0:26:59] <%Josef_Stryker> High Tier at least
[0:27:00] <bigshedman> Dan finally living up to his true potential PogChamp
[0:27:00] <scrublord009> He is on par with the rest the game
[0:27:01] <%Josef_Stryker> But not Top Tier
[0:27:03] <striderzer0> hes getting high damage without trigger
[0:27:09] <DaKnightWarrior> Ryu deserves all these buffs. he's been so bad since the end of season 1.
[0:27:10] <scrublord009> Dan is better LUL
[0:27:10] <yousayyugi> Building houses on fornite make him stronger
[0:27:22] <%ggbhtg> is DAN top 5, that's what I wanna know
[0:27:29] <TigerClaws12> Dan has reverse beat, it's busted LUL
[0:27:30] <leith_aziz> Yep
[0:27:38] <leith_aziz> People thoght DAN was better
[0:27:41] <joshua_42> Dan is where he shoulda been always
[0:27:42] <+loukemia83> TRIED SO HARD
[0:27:44] <%Josef_Stryker> Meanwhile I'm just enjoying my 3f with Nash and buffed VT2
[0:27:44] <%LastHazzerd> the limiters are OFF
[0:27:45] <+GrooovinMagic> Weighted clothing
[0:27:45] <+loukemia83> AND GOT SO FAR
[0:28:04] <pmda2126> barry bonds
[0:28:06] <scrublord009> Xsamurai should try again
[0:28:21] <pmda2126> ryu bonds actually
[0:28:24] <striderzer0> @TigerClaws12 but you have to be consistent to get the most out of it
[0:28:34] <leith_aziz> The recovery is less now atleast
[0:28:35] <%wibbwobbler> sf6 looks so far away lol
[0:28:43] <%Josef_Stryker> Eh I can wait for SF6
[0:28:46] <suckmartinez> woolie who was your killer instinct main
[0:28:54] <leith_aziz> Dude Dan is the FIRST character for this season
[0:28:58] <%Josef_Stryker> All SFV needs now is GGPO
[0:29:02] <leith_aziz> You're gonna wait for a lot
[0:29:05] <scrublord009> Imma get out
[0:29:08] <TigerClaws12> @striderzer0 timing is pretty laxed when you're used to feint canceling in Garou, once you got it down, he's a pressure monster
[0:30:25] <scrublord009> But Laura got buffed. Also idom exists LUL
[0:30:27] <%zanzibar_junker> SFV needs buffer frames
[0:30:31] <striderzer0> @TigerClaws12 saw a gill kinda wall justins dan with vshifts and jumping out of dan commit to cancel
[0:30:44] <leith_aziz> At least in Strive, Leo seems good overall
[0:30:44] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1364103397230718976?s=19

[0:30:57] <Arek_1> Conversely, a bunch of characters normals received projectile-invincible hurtboxes from starting 1 frame before active frames.

[0:31:30] <$razielhex> Raaaaaaaaaaaainbow Mika
[0:31:45] <scrublord009> Necalli vtrigger changes
[0:31:46] <$razielhex> her trailer was so great
[0:32:01] <$razielhex> had to track down that trailer music 'cuz it's so good
[0:32:11] <+0neReeler> massive gamble
[0:32:38] <leith_aziz> Can go either way
[0:33:00] <%Josef_Stryker> I'll probably stick with VT2
[0:33:25] <striderzer0> he stays in VT but does he still build v gauge with that glitch?
[0:34:00] <scrublord009> Vt2 is good but now it's matchup dependant now
[0:34:21] <%Josef_Stryker> If someone whiffs it, it's CCable
[0:34:23] <scrublord009> 9frames
[0:34:46] <TanyaSaberFace> hello
[0:34:47] <+0neReeler> if read that's a CC
[0:34:59] <dks_junkie> woolieSMUG_SG
[0:35:10] <dustworthmain> Juri remains awkward
[0:35:16] <scrublord009> If you vshift a light button. you can punish that shit
[0:35:31] <leith_aziz> Rashid is still top tier mateerial
[0:35:32] <striderzer0> the fact that you need to be in neutral too. ive seen so many people get clipped cause the tried to vshift but were holding back
[0:35:36] <bigshedman> Alex PogChamp
[0:35:42] <leith_aziz> Unless v-shieft gets too good
[0:35:42] <Arek_1> Vega: "Your corner? ...Your corner." LUL
[0:35:46] <TanyaSaberFace> juris biggest buff would be taking off her jacket
[0:35:49] <scrublord009> Alex mains where you at?
[0:35:51] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Bison got damage nerfs BibleThump
[0:36:05] <%Josef_Stryker> Bison's still good
[0:36:09] <%Josef_Stryker> U need not worry
[0:36:16] <%Josef_Stryker> Plus he's much more dangerous with V-Shift
[0:36:19] <dmysta3000> Mika got nerfed into the ground apparently
[0:36:27] <%Josef_Stryker> Dhalsim got it *rough*
[0:36:32] <leith_aziz> Mika got setups buffs
[0:36:37] <leith_aziz> She seems ok
[0:36:45] <%Josef_Stryker> People claim Nash is the worst, I'd say Dhalsim is probably the worst now
[0:36:52] <%AlteisenReiseZ> yooo RIP Dhalsim
[0:36:57] <leith_aziz> Dhalsim got HARD nerfs
[0:36:57] <striderzer0> bison got cMK cancel right? @Josef_Stryker
[0:37:06] <%zanzibar_junker> Ono was the problem
[0:37:14] <%Josef_Stryker> I don't play Bison. But I just know that he's still dangerous
[0:37:20] <bigshedman> I thought Dhalsim will mostly suffer because of Vshift?
[0:37:31] <leith_aziz> They might not fix it in the end
[0:37:43] <TanyaSaberFace> they should skip straight to 7
[0:37:43] <leith_aziz> Which is sad
[0:37:43] <+loukemia83> Why fix CFN with a game with crap netplay?
[0:37:45] <%Josef_Stryker> We still have Version 5.5 to hope for
[0:37:45] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:37:51] <striderzer0> im bought the season pass cause of oro
[0:37:53] <dmysta3000> It might be too late for them to fix it properly
[0:37:57] <leith_aziz> Strive is RIGHT THERE
[0:38:00] <+OdysseyKnight> "but that's not how we do things"
[0:38:04] <leith_aziz> If we talk netcode
[0:38:06] <+NYCrownlessKing> it needs mvci rollback now
[0:38:10] <+NYCrownlessKing> for sf6
[0:38:12] <+jiggy_snipe> no excuse
[0:38:17] <%wibbwobbler> good stuff
[0:38:22] <Sapphire_Breeze> @leith_aziz if only the lobbies weren't terrible
[0:38:28] <leith_aziz> But I know MVCI had good netcode, so they have the people for it
[0:38:34] <JeoDood> but that mod works only for pc
[0:38:35] <MKII> core-a's rollback video recently got translated into japanese so hopefully even more people know about sfv's bad netcode
[0:38:36] <TigerClaws12> bullied LUL
[0:38:45] <striderzer0> *will smith points * GG Strive netcode
[0:38:47] <%LastHazzerd> they responded!
[0:38:53] <joshua_42> KOFXV ROLLBACK FINALLY
[0:38:54] <@Menitta> They responded thank god
[0:39:04] <biggswedg3> is it enough?
[0:39:07] <leith_aziz> Horray !
[0:39:11] <leith_aziz> I guess ?
[0:39:11] <%CptnCampy61> ‚ÄúInternal rollback solution‚Äù still a little vague
[0:39:14] <+NYCrownlessKing> it was such bad pr for them to not be as vocal about it during the round table lol
[0:39:24] <+NYCrownlessKing> like they dug their own grave when they already planned to add it
[0:39:45] <leith_aziz> @CptnCampy61: That was how Strive's netcode was also made, but Zinac was there to help as well
[0:39:45] <+NYCrownlessKing> strive did the same thing @cptncampy61
[0:39:45] <Saltmeisterr> it could be trash
[0:39:46] <+jiggy_snipe> internal rollback solution probably just means not ggpo
[0:40:06] <+NYCrownlessKing> internal means we don't wanna keep paying for outsource help with rollback its obvious
[0:40:08] <TigerClaws12> the R word was banned during the roundtable, Harada's too strong FeelsBadMan  NYCrownlessKing
[0:40:13] <+NYCrownlessKing> so they will make their own hybrid
[0:40:14] <%Mordexai0> Can't wait for the Eleven Only SFV Tournaments
[0:40:21] <BlackermanZX> Thank god for the Rollback
[0:40:25] <Jaggertail> OWL2019Winston
[0:40:27] <leith_aziz> Internall rollback is basically making you're own type of rollback netcode so you can use it for later games. Thats how Strive did it
[0:40:30] <DaKnightWarrior> hmm
[0:40:30] <biggswedg3> thats a bad look rn
[0:40:31] <Qualityhugeweeb> cant believe Jiyuna said the R word

[1:30:42] <%nakunattakage> REGGIE LUL
[1:30:44] <+eugas_> it was so goddamn good that game. five star jank
[1:30:45] <%KineticZen> IRA vs the Taliban
[1:30:46] <WG101> death battle for grown men
[1:30:46] <%AlcoholicBlackGuy> That show hit different.
[1:30:47] <+TawnyMonarch> HEMA time boys
[1:30:47] <pmda2126> yup
[1:30:51] <leith_aziz> So.... death battle ?
[1:30:52] <Roasted_Pheasant> Deadliest Warrior is the fucking sickest
[1:30:54] <%Sparkseid> yuuuup
[1:30:54] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[1:30:55] <bigshedman> Oh god I remember that show. They tested out a stinger grenade and concluded that it sucked because it was non-lethal LUL
[1:30:56] <+PianoAlone> LUL
[1:31:00] <%DashXero> And they were right.
[1:31:00] <+FuqBoiSlim> The HEMAtoads loved that shit
[1:31:03] <cj_art> those sims were the dopest shit ever
[1:31:05] <ainda_> it was a show about cutting dead pigs in half
[1:31:06] <rameiramaster> @KineticZen LUL
[1:31:11] <RichochetForce> @FuqBoiSlim Oh my god, Hematoads
[1:31:11] <masterfire23> I played the 360 game

[1:31:28] <leith_aziz> Interesting
[1:31:31] <%nakunattakage> could fight with a fish limesPoggers üëç
[1:31:40] <%ggbhtg> April 7, 2009 ‚Äì September 14, 2011 ; damn, I thought this show was endlessly relevant
[1:31:46] <%ggbhtg> I never stop hearing about it
[1:31:55] <+TopTieramisu> did deadliest warrior actually portray the samurai sword as the crappy metal weapon they actually were?
[1:32:07] <bigshedman> Only ran for 2 years? I feel like it was on the air for YEARS but maybe they just kept rerunning it.
[1:32:16] <RichochetForce> Did Deadliest Warrior show that Samurai were mainly bowmen at first and then spearmen?
[1:32:18] <%CommanderSqueaks> The light is hiding it, but who are the two characters hanging next to Woolie's head?
[1:32:18] <DDDorsett> SpikeTV shut down not too long  ago
[1:32:28] <%nakunattakage> @TopTieramisu they typically only had weapons used in their most optimal of scenarios when testing them
[1:32:28] <%Exiliator> The for honor approach
[1:32:31] <Roasted_Pheasant> Don't forget MACK
[1:32:33] <leith_aziz> 2 years can still include LOTS of episodes
[1:32:40] <+TopTieramisu> @nakunattakage so no samurai swords
[1:32:40] <blue6sub6remnant6> But why would Sun Tzu fight himself if the game would allow him to lose?
[1:32:41] <%DashXero> @CommanderSqueaks Nenji Ogata and Miwako
[1:32:51] <%nakunattakage> @CommanderSqueaks looks like 13 sentinels
[1:32:54] <%ggbhtg> it WAS on Spike, no wonder it's dumb
[1:33:02] <%commanderclaw> commanderclaw subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Protip: The "Hellish Quart" referenced in the title refers to a specific cut Turkish duelists would make where you cut your opponent's chest and genitals in one swipe. Not enough to lose the duel, you gotta lose your dong too.
[1:33:04] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @TanyaSaberFace
[1:33:05] <%KennyKRool> That Legendary category
[1:33:05] <+eugas_> its a lot more realistic than the deadliest warrior game
[1:33:08] <leith_aziz> Those are 12 sentinels characters
[1:33:08] <%nakunattakage> @TopTieramisu they probably had one episode with a samurai sword, but it's been so long I can't really remember tbh
[1:33:10] <leith_aziz> 13
[1:33:13] <%CommanderSqueaks> @nakunattakage Also ignoring that most Samurai were primarily archers first and swordsman second. >.> again, weebs with a budget.
[1:33:36] <+TopTieramisu> japan didn't have access to quality metal
[1:33:39] <RichochetForce> Also, Japanese metal kind of sucks
[1:33:39] <WG101> but does it have blitz netcode?
[1:33:44] <%KennyKRool> They had Ninjas vs Spartan where they compared Wakizashis vs Bronze Age shortswords
[1:33:44] <TanyaSaberFace> woolie theres a similar game called hatashiai
[1:33:44] <%DashXero> Wait... Is that Kingdom Come Deliverance? That game was a snore fest.
[1:33:46] <RichochetForce> That's why the "1000 folds" shit came about
[1:33:51] <RichochetForce> It's making the most of dogshit metal
[1:33:53] <%nakunattakage> @CommanderSqueaks Not advocating for the show or anything, but they typically had diverse loadouts for all their warriors, so they did cover that IIRC, but you're right in that it was more nerd glorification than historical facts
[1:34:17] <+TopTieramisu> it's a bunch of history war nerds
[1:34:17] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:34:21] <%CommanderSqueaks> @nakunattakage It was Death Battle for real life. After I stopped caring about how dumb it was, I loved that show.
[1:34:22] <+TopTieramisu> making a show
[1:34:23] <Roasted_Pheasant> "A PIG CARCASS!"
[1:34:28] <+FuqBoiSlim> Yeah yeah who cares about """historical accuracy""" and shit like that I just wanna see the two men fight
[1:34:28] <%AlcoholicBlackGuy> It's one of the only things that matter.  It's so sick
[1:34:28] <weapon000> pig advantage
[1:34:35] <Nocturnment> You also had shit like CIA vs KGB
[1:34:36] <RichochetForce> Summon: PIG
[1:34:36] <leith_aziz> Pig abuse

[1:34:51] <Roasted_Pheasant> "Developed by Slytherin Studios!"
[1:34:51] <Applecannon63> How many fucking waste pork chops
[1:34:51] <+TopTieramisu> it looks really good
[1:34:54] <%nakunattakage> @CommanderSqueaks I always wondered how they built that dumb ass computer program that ran the simulated battles LUL seemed like it was jank code theater but we'll never know
[1:34:54] <+Robopengy> I love this game
[1:34:55] <%AyotoCorp> This game's rad
[1:34:55] <+Deyne_547> I just remembered deadliest warrior I think it was out of ideas
[1:34:58] <HelluvaNohbody> The Italian magia vs the yakuza
[1:34:59] <The7thCrownLessKing> wasn't there a Taliban vs IRA episode?
[1:35:00] <leith_aziz> GTA IV ragdoll ?
[1:35:00] <RichochetForce> Here. We. Go.
[1:35:01] <dfs_k> 1000 fold thing and shit metal in japan  are misconceptions btw
[1:35:01] <+eugas_> its so good
[1:35:04] <leith_aziz> Id love that
[1:35:07] <+Etherealizer> Reggie would like Forged In Fire they make swords and then test them on pigs lol
[1:35:09] <%CommanderSqueaks> @nakunattakage Wasn't it just them running Total War a bunch of times?

[1:35:33] <Roasted_Pheasant> There was also Green Berets vs Spetsnaz

[1:38:23] <leith_aziz> F
[1:38:25] <daddyscumeez> almost everything is an instant kill
[1:38:26] <%CommanderSqueaks> Most games have all swords being super rigid, but a lot of blades were actually kind of floppy, it's cool seeing a game actually show that.
[1:38:28] <whiteblacklight74> bumber
[1:38:29] <Thunderhog> TECH THIS
[1:38:30] <RichochetForce> There's invisible stamina gauges
[1:38:32] <+Robopengy> There's a throw that just cuts off your opponents head
[1:38:37] <%ChoculaUltra> TECH OR DIE
[1:38:42] <%X2Eliah> This sounds like a lot of complexity and not a lot of fun
[1:38:48] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> throw seems pretty reactable
[1:38:50] <RichochetForce> @CommanderSqueaks Yeah, European Swords were spring tempered
[1:38:53] <lazerscraper> So its like UFC where you HAVE to tech the submission grabs like its Tekken
[1:38:53] <therealtacopancakes> That video that someone tweeted under this announcement of the expert commenting on this game was actually pretty good
[1:39:07] <+FuqBoiSlim> Yeah, this game seems it was made for and by a bunch of HEMAtodes but it looks sick regardless
[1:39:07] <SheefEatsBeef> this is sick
[1:39:07] <lazerscraper> the dreamcast UFC games i mean
[1:39:08] <leith_aziz> Though I admit this seems more like busywork and less about fun
[1:39:10] <+eugas_> @X2Eliah its surprisingly intuitive and very fun
[1:39:12] <%Exiliator> Eeriely quiet
[1:39:20] <+TopTieramisu> this game is fun from what i've seen
[1:39:21] <leith_aziz> This is still a pretty good tutorial
[1:39:22] <%CalderGaming> bushido blade vibes
[1:39:31] <+TopTieramisu> big bushido blade energy
[1:39:41] <leith_aziz> The fact that it shows you beforehand
[1:39:52] <leith_aziz> You get an example of how to play
[1:40:06] <+wmeldrum> frame data
[1:40:09] <+TopTieramisu> a tutorial in a fighting game?
[1:40:16] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> I like this recent fighting game trend of having videos that show you what's happening
[1:40:18] <WG101> i feel like i'm learning how to fence rather than how to play
[1:40:23] <SheefEatsBeef> „ÄåT E M P O„Äç
[1:40:23] <RichochetForce> A fighting game explaining itself
[1:40:25] <RichochetForce> and its goals
[1:40:33] <RichochetForce> Damn, more games need to do this.
[1:40:42] <leith_aziz> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_: I love Strive's movelist
[1:40:51] <astrophizz> block cancelling
[1:40:52] <leith_aziz> It does exactly this
[1:40:56] <daddyscumeez> backward cancels out of stuff
[1:40:57] <Palmtuna> @WG101 You are not wrong. This could 100% work as a fencing tutorial as well
[1:40:57] <ainda_> @WoolieVersus Yeah in game you can press F3 and it brings up stamina bars, idk what that would be on pad
[1:40:58] <%CommanderSqueaks> Woolie is loving this tech.
[1:41:11] <%AyotoCorp> @WoolieVersus the movelist is kind of universal, but right now it only displays the moves for the Ryu/Ken characters
[1:41:14] <+Grayhammatter> ok.
[1:41:27] <WG101> LOOK AT THIS CAST
[1:41:27] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:41:27] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @leith_aziz yep, the moment I saw that in granblue I hoped strive would have it and sure enough, praise be to arcsys
[1:41:45] <DolbyFire> Marie is cheap as hell right now
[1:41:48] <%CommanderSqueaks> I wish that under the night they had the name of the sword they were using.
[1:41:48] <Arek_1> Jacek (YA-TSEK).
[1:41:52] <%CommanderSqueaks> **the name
[1:41:55] <%ChoculaUltra> hoping the final boss character straight up has a gun
[1:42:01] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> girl on the left looks pretty cool
[1:42:01] <%DashXero> Barabas was a murderer
[1:42:08] <gyaruFrog> that quart is HELLISH
[1:42:10] <+TopTieramisu> i wish the character designs were a little less pedestrian
[1:42:10] <michaelpolandwatcher> is tat mount and blade?

[1:42:21] <+TawnyMonarch> nice fancy pugaree
[1:42:25] <%KineticZen> Barabbas was released by Pontius Pilate in Jesus's stead
[1:42:26] <+TawnyMonarch> or not lmao

[1:42:44] <leith_aziz> Is it me or do I see alot of blur ?
[1:42:44] <%CommanderSqueaks> Okay that bloom is a bit too much, I can barely see the sword.
[1:42:45] <KaiGoesMoo> This really does have Bushido Blade vibes
[1:42:50] <RichochetForce> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ I understand completely
[1:42:53] <+TheGreatSunbro> @CommanderSqueaks ...Oh I get it now right
[1:42:57] <+Robopengy> Each bumper does a different throw
[1:42:59] <whiteblacklight74> bushido blade but it's unity instead
[1:43:00] <+TheGreatSunbro> That took me a minute. Good. I appreciate you
[1:43:02] <+TopTieramisu> placeholder LUL
[1:43:05] <gyaruFrog> this is only for one character
[1:43:07] <leith_aziz> Music aint bad
[1:43:07] <%DashXero> This looks pretty cool.
[1:43:07] <striderzer0> have you guys seen the full fighting games people made in dreams?
[1:43:18] <daddyscumeez> @WoolieVersus it's real, it's just that the "artwork" is placeholder, i believe
[1:43:20] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh that's a very generous stamina bar.
[1:43:20] <Roasted_Pheasant> I love how honest this game looks
[1:43:25] <kingdonjohn> Bushido blade but more westey
[1:43:27] <%DashXero> It sounds like the Witcher's music...
[1:43:34] <%DashXero> Just a bit.
[1:43:35] <michaelpolandwatcher> why is that french guy frigging squating as like to poop?
[1:43:46] <Crowroost> D: Stab
[1:43:48] <RichochetForce> @michaelpolandwatcher It's a woman, and I think that's proper form
[1:43:48] <+TopTieramisu> "guy"
[1:43:49] <%nakunattakage> Wait what'd you press to get the stamina bars? limesD
[1:43:50] <WG101> that's the fencing stance

[1:43:58] <%nakunattakage> ah ty ty

[1:44:02] <whiteblacklight74> Honestly I can't unsee the XBLA jank
[1:44:07] <leith_aziz> The persons stance on the left..
[1:44:12] <whiteblacklight74> It's polished but it still looks janky
[1:44:13] <+FuqBoiSlim> hon hon hon zis eez le stance
[1:44:18] <+Robopengy> This reminds me of the Deadliest Warrior games, but like this is good
[1:44:21] <+eugas_> the jank is good
[1:44:22] <whiteblacklight74> Anyone feels the same way?
[1:44:24] <gyaruFrog> damn cheap fencers and their jabs
[1:44:24] <striderzer0> @michaelpolandwatcher thats the way of a french fighter, poop to fight, fight to poop
[1:44:25] <+eugas_> jank is flavor
[1:44:27] <%CommanderSqueaks> @michaelpolandwatcher Keeping the internals away from the pointing bit, notice how his core is far back?
[1:44:31] <+TopTieramisu> this game is pre-alpha so

[1:44:34] <SheefEatsBeef> i hope the fencing guy from the subreddit here/
[1:44:34] <michaelpolandwatcher> @RichochetForce maybe, but deffinetly not proper form, cuz its disadavntaegous to quick movment

[1:51:41] <jorniev> while you studied the blade i studied the other blade
[1:51:43] <%CommanderSqueaks> That heart stab is strong.
[1:51:48] <Roasted_Pheasant> THESE ANIMATIONS
[1:51:51] <michaelpolandwatcher> Jacek is probably a fully counter character

[1:53:34] <michaelpolandwatcher> xno hes the bandit they let go instead of Jesus
[1:53:34] <Dave_VD> There are forward-forward inputs and other crazy shit
[1:53:36] <Knight_Nero> "Give me your hat."
[1:53:37] <leith_aziz> Okay that was wrong
[1:53:40] <%DashXero> He was released to the public.
[1:53:45] <+TawnyMonarch> he's the one who sang "alwyas look on the brightside of life"
[1:53:47] <alexandrecau> no he sav ed instead of jesus

[1:53:54] <+Bailey__gaming> this is the new Bushido Blade kinda thing isnt it
[1:53:55] <T_Sasquatch> how the fuck do you guys just know that out of your mind LUL
[1:54:07] <+TheGreatSunbro> The crowd wanted him released instead of Jesus
[1:54:08] <T_Sasquatch> Bible trivia just in your head
[1:54:10] <deviljhojho_> bible classes from back in the day
[1:54:11] <+soFISHticated98> what am I looking at
[1:54:11] <leith_aziz> Sorry, this may vary with my religion
[1:54:12] <deviljhojho_> tomatoPunished
[1:54:16] <weapon000> he was released for the Passover
[1:54:17] <%wolfofsound> woolie the sinner
[1:54:21] <leith_aziz> Lets spare it
[1:54:23] <+TopTieramisu> i wonder if this game will focus only on european fighting styles
[1:54:29] <alexandrecau> popular like baraba in the passion is  a fucking idiom for a reeason
[1:54:31] <+PianoAlone> hand destroyed
[1:54:32] <%ChoculaUltra> this is just another Saturday afternoon for the old guy LUL
[1:54:32] <$Essixian> They're cossacks, of course they're drunk
[1:54:34] <Roasted_Pheasant> @wolfofsound Woolie the Sinner stole my cross
[1:54:34] <+FuqBoiSlim> I haven't stepped foot in a church since I was 12 yall are different
[1:54:35] <+Robopengy> I want them to land the head cut off grab so bad
[1:54:36] <RichochetForce> @TopTieramisu Probably, this game HEMA central
[1:54:37] <%CalderGaming> the SPIT
[1:54:43] <Mr_Zero5232> I wanna give a quick shout out to Skallagrim, the only godamn reason I knew this game existed cause the advertisement
[1:54:48] <+TheGreatSunbro> You would NOT Reggie
[1:54:51] <Mr_Zero5232> Was non existent
[1:54:51] <michaelpolandwatcher> @TopTieramisu there is like 50 that focus on asian, sooo
[1:54:54] <+Bailey__gaming> are these historical people?
[1:54:58] <+TawnyMonarch> I would simply stop bleeding
[1:54:59] <Enyoyable> A cut artery just means you're fighting on a timer.
[1:55:00] <bobxmaker> wasn't there like a deal that was made from the public, either they release jesus or barabas, the public chose to free barabas or something
[1:55:09] <michaelpolandwatcher> released instead of jesus even thou was guilty
[1:55:10] <therealtacopancakes> Give us Barabbas
[1:55:11] <+TopTieramisu> @RichochetForce honestly? that's totally fair. asian fighting styles have a lot of representation
[1:55:13] <Arek_1> Jacek is pronounced like YA-TSEK.
[1:55:15] <leith_aziz> Is this exclusive to Chrtistianity ?
[1:55:19] <Dante_Namikaze1> @mr_zero5232 man I didn't think I'd see anyone in chat mention him
[1:55:23] <leith_aziz> Im not Christain
[1:55:23] <+eugas_> @Bailey__gaming nah. but they're based on historical styles and fashions
[1:55:24] <%ChoculaUltra> there's already threads on the Steam forums asking for Katana users LUL
[1:55:26] <+OmegaWeltall> i didnt come here for Bibble study SwiftRage
[1:55:28] <+soFISHticated98> it was a once a year thing for passover, the Romans would release one jewish prisoner
[1:55:31] <WG101> two-tapped
[1:55:31] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1364103397230718976?s=19
[1:55:35] <+TopTieramisu> @michaelpolandwatcher agreed. just curious to see how the interaction between eastern and western fighting styles would look in this game
[1:55:42] <gyaruFrog> its finally time for eurojank fighting games
[1:55:44] <+TopTieramisu> in a very deadliest warrior kind of way
[1:55:44] <WG101> ONE AND DONE
[1:55:49] <RichochetForce> @TopTieramisu Yeah, we barely seen anything more out of European combat beyond generic sword and spears without any actual martial style
[1:55:52] <Dante_Namikaze1> @choculaultra there always will be one
[1:55:56] <leith_aziz> Welcome to old times
[1:55:58] <%ChoculaUltra> that's real life melee combat for ya
[1:56:00] <Mr_Zero5232> @dante_namikaze1 dudes fuckin legend, and there some degree of separation between he and Woolie
[1:56:01] <+soFISHticated98> turns out dying sucks
[1:56:06] <Dave_VD> @ChoculaUltra Gotta get a gun-wielding boss character in too
[1:56:06] <leith_aziz> Its so depressing
[1:56:27] <alexandrecau> Back in the day everyone was sword fighting, in France they had to put a bunch of laws because nobles kept killing each other in duel
[1:56:31] <leith_aziz> OOF

[2:10:37] <+Ultimate_Edge> Longsword can fight the world
[2:10:37] <ainda_> straight up? i think this game should deduct wins from both players on double ko in tournament lol
[2:10:39] <RichochetForce> @DSD24 Historical European Martial Arts from old world Europe
[2:10:47] <SomersaultJustice> needs an unfair dude with a gun
[2:10:49] <DSD24> @RichochetForce Yo that's rad
[2:10:53] <whiteblacklight74> again,that's the problem when you get into realism
[2:10:53] <michaelpolandwatcher> @ainda_ it would take hours
[2:10:54] <blackkanye> Bruh
[2:10:59] <+Bailey__gaming> So to beat her you need a BIGGER sword
[2:10:59] <DSD24> Oooo
[2:11:02] <michaelpolandwatcher> ouch
[2:11:02] <WG101> EAR
[2:11:02] <whiteblacklight74> reality is inherently unbalanced

[2:11:03] <ThrillingTremors> yikes
[2:11:03] <coracor> the power of being sharp on both sides
[2:11:03] <Namillus> Woolie discovers the Truth that is langschwert
[2:11:06] <%ChoculaUltra> the blade clashing/parrying sounds so good lol
[2:11:09] <ainda_> @michaelpolandwatcher exactly
[2:11:10] <RichochetForce> @DSD24 Yeah, it's pretty rare. We mainly see Asian martial arts

[2:12:11] <Mr_Zero5232> people are maybe too much in their heads on this, European martial arts covers a lot of areas, this is only the amount of fighters they started with, it doesn't mean they'll only focus on these
[2:12:12] <Roasted_Pheasant> DETECTION AVERTED

[2:13:32] <ainda_> @WoolieVersus im on keyboard, but for the stances i have to hold the direction for a second BEFORE pressing longguard, mabye the same on pad
[2:13:35] <+eugas_> isabella has the most extensive moveset
[2:13:42] <michaelpolandwatcher> oh THIS music is the witcher
[2:13:45] <+samuraiknack> Yo Disney give these guys Money and time to make Star Wars
[2:13:48] <+eugas_> @ainda_ its the same on pad, in my experience
[2:13:49] <DSD24> Steel for humans
[2:14:02] <WG101> STAB
[2:14:04] <skyentombment> Hey, wha happen to Infinite? I left for a bit, did it crash again?
[2:14:19] <JeoDood> long sword
[2:14:23] <RichochetForce> Woolie spoke the truth just now
[2:14:25] <+MrAtheGreat> that wa bs lul
[2:14:25] <+TankControls> this is still infinite, after one of the patches that happened mid game
[2:14:27] <Hoot_Patoots> blood from her mouth but she's still going
[2:14:30] <%Juriasu> she just tanked that neck slash
[2:14:31] <Hoot_Patoots> what a champion
[2:14:31] <+TankControls> what an upgrade, right?
[2:14:34] <ThrillingTremors> top tier?
[2:14:35] <+MrAtheGreat> got a blade righ through the neck
[2:14:35] <+samuraiknack> It was too hype for the channels
[2:14:37] <michaelpolandwatcher> ok so basically you cant parry the big sword with  tiny sabre
[2:14:39] <+Ultimate_Edge> Isabella stays top tier until a spear user gets in there
[2:14:41] <Solidnick18> yoo
[2:14:41] <+Bailey__gaming> psaBig Sword > all other swords
[2:14:42] <dukenux> Yoo, this game
[2:14:48] <DSD24> Damn
[2:14:49] <RichochetForce> @Ultimate_Edge Exactly
[2:14:50] <SheefEatsBeef> we need an isabella mirror match
[2:14:53] <ThrillingTremors> really wish this game had online tbh
[2:14:55] <trashboyee> i bet rapier lady counters
[2:14:56] <OldManDeckardCain> she got all that experience fighting infidels while jacek was just getting drunk in the tavern LUL
[2:14:57] <Roasted_Pheasant> Mental guard broken
[2:15:07] <DSD24> Seriously these death animations are super cool
[2:15:19] <Hoot_Patoots> i would play a single player game with isabella
[2:15:20] <%ChoculaUltra> longswords are op!
[2:15:21] <ainda_> You really need to swing to approach, moving forward just guarding is suicide. like technically you can block but it often fails
[2:15:21] <masterfire23> isabella bout to make me act up
[2:15:21] <+0ctaeder> how long has woolie been using that ps5 contorller?
[2:15:22] <+Bailey__gaming> this music is Witcher as all fuck
[2:15:23] <Solidnick18> oh shit
[2:15:26] <michaelpolandwatcher> this, ladies and gentle man why we have3 ARMOR
[2:15:28] <Roasted_Pheasant> Isabella sucks at extra close range
[2:15:28] <dukenux> wow the animations in this are better than i expected from a preview material
[2:15:32] <+TopTieramisu> it's because it's a polish dev
[2:15:39] <+eugas_> isabella got me acting unwise
[2:15:44] <michaelpolandwatcher> @TopTieramisu i think its hungarian
[2:15:46] <RichochetForce> @michaelpolandwatcher Listen to them man everyone.

[2:17:30] <Solidnick18> LUL
[2:17:32] <+samuraiknack> The guy to Isabella left looks like he goes in dry when doing anal
[2:17:33] <OldManDeckardCain> they were already doing that to their male slaves, so there were a lot of eunuchs there LUL
[2:17:33] <LordOfThePoultry> STOP

[2:18:04] <ThunderSaad> @WoolieVersus the guys in the far left and right are they not playable ?
[2:18:05] <+TheGreatSunbro> Leo coming in and ripping your dick off
[2:18:05] <%CalderGaming> rapier mirror match gogogo
[2:18:17] <ainda_> @ThunderSaad nah not yet
[2:18:19] <weapon000> @samuraiknack He looks like one of the nilihists in the Big Lewboski
[2:18:29] <ThunderSaad> okay thanks
[2:18:32] <RichochetForce> @weapon000 Oh wow, he does
[2:18:48] <dukenux> Rapier guy looks like a guy i know
[2:18:58] <RichochetForce> Rapier guy? Marie?
[2:18:58] <T_Sasquatch> its interesting how the radio is still alive even after podcasting became mainstream
[2:19:02] <AnnerionS> on everyone, but especially Isabelle, try forward forward y.
[2:19:06] <michaelpolandwatcher> speaking of polish and absolutely not as good fighting, ever played WItcher 2? Woolie
[2:19:17] <michaelpolandwatcher> its cool
[2:19:20] <dukenux> i mean the guy on far left @RichochetForce is he not wielding one?
[2:19:24] <+worldbrand> shoutouts to the bestbuy guy for insisting that XLR cables didn't exist
[2:19:38] <weapon000> @T_Sasquatch cause it's free and all cars have radios
[2:19:42] <RichochetForce> Ohh, I can't really tell. I know they can't select him or the guy on the far right
[2:19:44] <%CalderGaming> The Missile Knows Where It Is
[2:19:54] <DSD24> Would the secret character be a dude with a musket?
[2:20:22] <RichochetForce> Would muskets even exist at this point?
[2:20:23] <%Exiliator> That would be a neat video idea
[2:20:23] <+rednecked__crake> pads for fighting games are very not poggers
[2:20:25] <weapon000> @DSD24 that was bushido blade's thing what's it?
[2:20:27] <dukenux> the secret char is a grapler
[2:20:30] <RichochetForce> Ones that don't take 3+ minutes to reload
[2:20:33] <kingdonjohn> dsd24 with a bayonet
[2:20:42] <DSD24> @weapon000 Nah in Bushido Blade it was a guy with a Revolver
[2:20:43] <Arek_1> Btw, Reggie. Jacek is pronounced like YA-TSEK.
[2:20:44] <michaelpolandwatcher> @RichochetForce absolutely, but it had 1 in 30 chance to hit xD
[2:20:47] <bobxmaker> can't you just hot glue some shit on it to make a makeshift rubber coating?
[2:20:53] <RichochetForce> @michaelpolandwatcher LUL
[2:21:00] <dukenux> @RichochetForce maybe not muskets but personal firearms would be a thing
[2:21:02] <weapon000> @DSD24 yeah that's kinda what I meant
[2:21:09] <dukenux> Yatzek
[2:21:09] <T_Sasquatch> @weapon000 true i forget wifi isnt widely available
[2:21:13] <RichochetForce> I forgot they were still rocking spherical bullets and had no barrel rifling
[2:21:16] <fernanda_ps2> hi
[2:21:20] <AnnerionS> the guy on the far left has a schiavona
[2:21:21] <michaelpolandwatcher> woolie actually has a good polish accent
[2:21:30] <ainda_> hey people familiar with Parsec is it gonna put me to default keyboard controls?
[2:21:35] <fernanda_ps2> whens marvel
[2:21:38] <%Exiliator> what?
[2:21:41] <DSD24> @weapon000 Oh man by bad, I thought you asked what weapon they used in Busido Blade
[2:21:41] <+NarcissistCactus> someone will commission that
[2:21:45] <$Nested_Dreams> Reggie's polish is pretty goood

[2:22:26] <dukenux> ow
[2:22:27] <michaelpolandwatcher> ouch
[2:22:33] <ainda_> spamming, an attack that is
[2:22:36] <+TopTieramisu> when you see isabella in the battlefield, run
[2:22:48] <JeoDood> full suit of armor comeing soon
[2:22:53] <+RobinFoDays> What platform is this game on
[2:22:58] <gyaruFrog> backdashing is free in this game
[2:23:00] <%CalderGaming> Steam
[2:23:02] <+thecowpow> all that for a drop of blood
[2:23:04] <DSD24> Bonk
[2:23:05] <ulcaban> Love these sounds
[2:23:07] <+eugas_> @RobinFoDays gog and steam
[2:23:08] <WG101> LODGED IN THAT HEAD
[2:23:08] <RichochetForce> For the fully armored stuff are we going to see them using the sword has a club?
[2:23:20] <DSD24> Mordhau Grip right?
[2:23:25] <ulcaban> Real swords go tap-tap, not CLANG
[2:23:26] <+RobinFoDays> Thank you, guys
[2:23:30] <RichochetForce> I think so
[2:23:42] <dukenux> halfswording when
[2:23:42] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1364103397230718976?s=19
[2:23:45] <WG101> THAT WAS DEEP
[2:23:48] <+TopTieramisu> ROFL
[2:23:49] <+eugas_> love that chop
[2:23:49] <WG101> DEEP IN THE FACE
[2:23:51] <RichochetForce> lol
[2:23:52] <+worldbrand> LUL
[2:23:54] <BaslerJones> LOL
[2:23:54] <+Grayhammatter> DEEP
[2:24:01] <JeoDood> down the mid
[2:24:10] <%CalderGaming> @RichochetForce did they say armored stuff would be in this game? this seems to be long after the age of plate
[2:24:25] <SolidusA> flesh wound
[2:24:32] <DSD24> Man this game is doing the Steel on Bone mechanic from Ninja Gaiden 3
[2:24:35] <%DashXero> Yo, Isabella is awesome!
[2:24:37] <NeroInfinite> Plate was still around in reinessance just not FULL plate
[2:24:40] <LoneFonte> maybe one day with mods
[2:24:41] <+OmegaWeltall> is there rollback netcode Kappa
[2:24:42] <RichochetForce> @CalderGaming Good point, I was just thinking from a gameplay variety perspective. Maybe someone with some focus on half-swording
[2:24:53] <+worldbrand> I mean that wound would still be messy and life altering
[2:24:53] <WG101> NECK
[2:24:55] <TigerClaws12> camera wilds out sometimes LUL
[2:24:58] <+TotalTortilla> Mind that online is Parsec/Remote Play only right now
[2:24:59] <RichochetForce> Even then, wasn't full plate not that common? It was expensive
[2:25:01] <LoneFonte> that CRUNCH
[2:25:02] <dukenux> yea
[2:25:04] <Solidnick18> this is a morbid arena
[2:25:18] <michaelpolandwatcher> maaan, those geman terms from fighting manuals are informative, but they only capture a part of the fighting, pummel throwing and the -haus were used in only specific condition, even if the armor blocks the edge the kinetic force carries
[2:25:20] <DSD24> Yeah this arena is pretty dire
[2:25:22] <%CalderGaming> yeah this is meant to be 1600s. even the longsword is bordering on antiquated
[2:25:24] <+eugas_> her leading foot also modifies what attacks she can do
[2:25:25] <%Juriasu> this is the stance _/ _/
[2:25:31] <NeroInfinite> Full palte was VERY expensive but it did provide the best protection..until guns became more common place
[2:25:32] <+TopTieramisu> her neck just walked into that blade
[2:25:38] <Solidnick18> oof
[2:25:47] <Mr_Zero5232> it's a fighting game, should there even be an established timeline? if you're gonna take it that far then why not a arquebus too?
[2:25:49] <DSD24> There's so many different death animations
[2:25:54] <%Lion_kun> Is there no Katana in this game?
[2:25:55] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> *slavic music intensifies*
[2:26:08] <RichochetForce> @Mr_Zero5232 Oof
[2:26:08] <Dante_Namikaze1> @lion_kun no

[2:26:42] <%CalderGaming> sabre*
[2:26:43] <OblivionSword1> @Lion_kun it's mostly HEMA based stuffs
[2:26:45] <Dante_Namikaze1> @lion_kun they wouldn't be used here at all

[2:32:15] <RichochetForce> Damn, that angle is brutal
[2:32:17] <@Menitta> So is this like Bushido Blade
[2:32:17] <+Grayhammatter> jesus, that's ridiculous
[2:32:19] <michaelpolandwatcher> shes op as isabella of Castille
[2:32:24] <RichochetForce> @Menitta Yes
[2:32:28] <Arek_1> I wonder if the szabla has some of the trickier maneuvers. Like a scorpion-like whip-stab from the left. And reversing the blade in a bind to stab.
[2:32:29] <@Menitta> fuckin sick
[2:32:33] <+OmegaWeltall> who else watches Skallagrim, Shadiversity and Metetron in here Kappa
[2:32:34] <DSD24> Oh jeez

[2:32:37] <trashboyee> lmao
[2:32:38] <%the_Punktuation> That stab!
[2:32:46] <DSD24> That was a lethal hit
[2:32:51] <weapon000> I'll let her spit in my mouth  zoneGasm
[2:32:51] <dukenux> Skallagrim actually did a review on this
[2:32:51] <+Sir_Louis> less of a WHAT
[2:32:52] <%Juriasu> less of a what monkaS
[2:32:53] <%Exiliator> Woah now
[2:32:55] <Solidnick18> wait what
[2:32:58] <dukenux> which is not surprising
[2:33:00] <+OmegaWeltall> yea he streamed it a bit

[2:33:08] <RichochetForce> Nani?
[2:33:10] <michaelpolandwatcher> @Arek_1 polak? probably yes, that made it mostly realistic but its mostly cross strikes
[2:33:11] <+NarcissistCactus> dunt
[2:33:12] <%DashXero> Slip of the tongue, folks. Nothing more.
[2:33:15] <Ecliptic_Origins> monkaS
[2:33:15] <Solidnick18> alright woolie
[2:33:16] <Palmtuna> @OmegaWeltall Skullagrim is always neat to watch. I'm not familiar with the other two though
[2:33:18] <GroundControl138> a yes a dut
[2:33:19] <daddyscumeez> ah yes, a clark kent
[2:33:21] <NeroInfinite> a cent

[2:33:31] <%CommanderSqueaks> Reggie's face. XD
[2:33:31] <Namillus> A freudrian slip, where you say one thing and mean your mother
[2:33:32] <michaelpolandwatcher> jesus, no chance
[2:33:40] <JeoDood> STAB
[2:33:42] <RichochetForce> YOWCH
[2:33:43] <Ashenik1> Fun fact: the Jacek:s uniform is a classic polish nobililty ''szlachta'' clothes that were inspired by the persian ones brought to poland by armenians merchants. So they are kind of being weebs about persian culture Kappa
[2:33:47] <Solidnick18> PogChamp
[2:33:49] <SomersaultJustice> this is like that thing reggie said last week
[2:33:50] <NeroInfinite> stabbed in the eye.
[2:33:50] <%Enemy_In_Disguise> in the FACE
[2:33:53] <%the_Punktuation> Oh amn

[2:34:00] <DSD24> Man I just getting into the music
[2:34:05] <RichochetForce> What's wild is I've seen Skallagrim use that move in videos
[2:34:07] <%the_Punktuation> Alright
[2:34:11] <weapon000> Woolie found the boss character
[2:34:12] <+the_Punktuation> gaaaa
[2:34:12] <%DashXero> She's awesome!
[2:34:19] <+Ultimate_Edge> Give the oppoenent a gun for a fair fight
[2:34:21] <RichochetForce> Apparently long sword users can cut like that AND then swing back
[2:34:22] <%DashXero> Do I have to have this game running to use Parsec?
[2:34:24] <%Struggleful> This women's swinging for the arteries and organs
[2:34:25] <Arek_1> @Arek_1 Tak, heh. And yeah, I guess with the blade flip trick, the szabla would win in a bind everytime, lol.
[2:34:26] <RichochetForce> to catch you
[2:34:28] <donstylo> Reggie try Marie against Isabella
[2:34:30] <dukenux> @Ashenik1 they were the biggest weebs about Sarmatians
[2:34:31] <+TotalTortilla> YEYEYE LET"S GO
[2:34:39] <michaelpolandwatcher> shes actually isabella of Rivia
[2:34:46] <%the_Punktuation> @WoolieVersus fyi, The Movelist for Jaek is the placeholder, if reggie was curious
[2:34:49] <%DashXero> Sweet. Thanks, Woolie!
[2:35:01] <T_Sasquatch> thats insane
[2:35:53] <Ashenik1> @dukenux  yeah and it nicely justifed their expoitation of non Sarmatans; meaning peasants. Serfdom man...
[2:35:54] <michaelpolandwatcher> UNTWITCHING in the face of danger
[2:35:56] <dukenux> stab stab stab
[2:36:08] <DSD24> You are bleedin
[2:36:19] <dukenux> @Ashenik1 aye, took long enough to abolish that crap
[2:36:38] <michaelpolandwatcher> in most of europe
[2:36:53] <DSD24> The Hellish Quart
[2:36:55] <%CommanderSqueaks> DISEMBOWELED
[2:36:58] <+Grayhammatter> straight through the neck? WHAT?
[2:37:00] <%Enemy_In_Disguise> HELLISH QUART
[2:37:01] <michaelpolandwatcher> what the hell, how it didint hit her? she shoulda got 2 time
[2:37:02] <Solidnick18> what the hell
[2:37:03] <Varanoo> CBT
[2:37:07] <RichochetForce> Ouch, the goddamn low
[2:37:07] <dukenux> HQ!
[2:37:18] <thunka10> ???
[2:37:21] <+Grayhammatter> uh...???
[2:37:22] <DSD24> You have been disarmed
[2:37:27] <weapon000> taking the bicep
[2:37:33] <%CommanderSqueaks> @thunka10 Can't fight if you can't swing a sword.
[2:37:35] <Arek_1> They're Parsecing now?
[2:37:39] <thunka10> FAIR
[2:37:39] <RichochetForce> Yes
[2:37:41] <@Menitta> I think that enemy got...the point
[2:37:50] <RichochetForce> That thrust was raw
[2:37:52] <michaelpolandwatcher> finta
[2:37:57] <Solidnick18> i love a good pummel smack
[2:37:57] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:37:58] <dukenux> yeah the range is crazy
[2:38:04] <%CommanderSqueaks> YO SHE WENT IN
[2:38:05] <+Grayhammatter> oh my god
[2:38:08] <Solidnick18> damn she's pretty fast
[2:38:14] <RichochetForce> My goodness, the lunge
[2:38:18] <DSD24> Damn you just blinded Babrabaz
[2:38:18] <+TotalTortilla> Damn, I got bodied LUL
[2:38:20] <+TotalTortilla> GG guys
[2:38:22] <trashboyee> someone pick marie
[2:38:26] <michaelpolandwatcher> lets ban her from the tournament for real
[2:38:29] <RichochetForce> Like someone said, Isabella is swinging for arteries and organs
[2:38:39] <dukenux> yeah i want to see the musketeer
[2:38:42] <Twin_Hallow> yeah I wanna see maria vs her too
[2:38:44] <@Menitta> wheres the link
[2:38:57] <dukenux> oh wait yeah, the muskets would be a thing, because there's a musketeer char, lol
[2:38:57] <ElPlasa> @TotalTortilla hey, you got some interesting footsies here and there
[2:38:58] <OldManDeckardCain> they should probably make her a little slower considering the range
[2:39:01] <%DashXero> I keep getting disconnect errors...
[2:39:09] <DSD24> I want Soul Edge
[2:39:14] <+TotalTortilla> @ElPlasa Thanks!
[2:39:33] <Roasted_Pheasant> Isabella has great range but if you're touching her she dies
[2:39:36] <RichochetForce> @OldManDeckardCain But that's the problem: Longsword users weren't slow
[2:39:36] <+OmegaWeltall> spears would be SO broken...untill you get in close
[2:39:39] <OblivionSword1> spears would be too good
[2:39:41] <%LastHazzerd> spears would be op as hell
[2:39:43] <michaelpolandwatcher> spears on that range is a 1 hit or die
[2:39:54] <+Titanium__Falcon> spears would be OP in a dueling game
[2:39:54] <dukenux> only if you could cut off the spear head or sth
[2:40:02] <wanderingdain90> I cant wait til they add John Marsden
[2:40:03] <Ashenik1> @dukenux  dude recently there were some movemnets for compensations to polsih vilages from the church and nobility families LUL
[2:40:04] <DSD24> Marie looks cool
[2:40:06] <%Enemy_In_Disguise> Where's my Halberds?
[2:40:07] <RichochetForce> Thinking about it, it depends on the spear
[2:40:11] <michaelpolandwatcher> @dukenux or just push it aside and get close
[2:40:12] <therealtacopancakes> a blunt weapon would be cool too
[2:40:12] <+OmegaWeltall> yes DnD gets weapons SO wrong. Longswords SHOULD be finesse weapons but NOOOOO
[2:40:16] <+eugas_> mack dlc when
[2:40:21] <Twin_Hallow> what about Axes
[2:40:30] <donstylo> Can you imagen how sick Scythes would be
[2:40:36] <%LastHazzerd> which is accurate to real life
[2:40:42] <%CommanderSqueaks> Give opponents the ability to grab the spear.
[2:40:43] <OldManDeckardCain> @RichochetForce they were slower than szablas at least
[2:40:43] <dukenux> @Ashenik1 damn, i need to research my genealogical tree then Kappa
[2:40:51] <RichochetForce> @OldManDeckardCain This is true
[2:40:52] <Ashenik1> Kappa
[2:40:53] <michaelpolandwatcher> only this shown, so isabelas sword excluded
[2:40:53] <+vaporousTippler> People went to war with spears, but dueled with swords.
[2:40:55] <Roasted_Pheasant> Europe loves swords
[2:40:57] <+OmegaWeltall> war scythes maybe, regular scythes are just to cut grass
[2:40:58] <@Menitta> final boss: guy with gun
[2:40:58] <Arek_1> There's no getting around some things. Longswords with all its variants will always have more range than single-handed swords. Except maybe rapiers.
[2:40:59] <+MisterCrimson> medieval footsies
[2:41:00] <+Orfington> mikiri counter :v
[2:41:00] <+Ultimate_Edge> Add a mace just to hear the crunch

[2:41:32] <donstylo> Scythe
[2:41:35] <Solidnick18> a scythe PogChamp
[2:41:37] <JeoDood> where  is the  armor
[2:41:38] <RichochetForce> But many weapons WERE modified farm tools
[2:41:39] <dukenux> Ninjas were basicly farmers
[2:41:40] <Arek_1> War scythe.
[2:41:43] <OldManDeckardCain> a peasant with a spear is the boss character
[2:41:46] <whiteblacklight74> frying pan rampage
[2:41:46] <DSD24> Heart stab
[2:41:53] <dukenux> yeyeye a warscythe

[2:42:06] <Solidnick18> shovel Kappa
[2:42:08] <donstylo> I wonder how would blunt weapons work like Clubs or Warhammers.
[2:42:11] <%Zero_Jacks> Flashback to That one fire emblem unit with the pot for a hat
[2:42:12] <Twin_Hallow> Most ppl didnt have armor right? unless they had decent money
[2:42:14] <+thedream_c> Poliska Blade eh
[2:42:16] <dukenux> Halberd, but that'd be even more op than a spear
[2:42:23] <RichochetForce> @Zero_Jacks Donnel? Yeah
[2:42:24] <%Jetzord> Would someone be able to post the link again?
[2:42:27] <+thedream_c> L E F T
[2:42:29] <%p4ntless> get a sick-ass warpick in there
[2:42:30] <%Zero_Jacks> yea yea
[2:42:33] <DSD24> I liked that animation cause Marie was still alive
[2:42:37] <stevenellis386> you went GOT on 'em
[2:42:39] <ainda_> There are historical fencing treatise for "peasent flails" i.e. Threshing flails
[2:42:42] <michaelpolandwatcher> thats why we train
[2:42:43] <+LordGeneric> Quick throw your sword at them and run away
[2:42:44] <+JWAdvocate83> Waiting for Woolie and Reggie to unlock the characters with the guns. LUL
[2:42:46] <RichochetForce> @Twin_Hallow Yes, most people were dirt poor. People were overwhelmingly armed with spears
[2:42:48] <+thedream_c> well thats why you try get it done fast
[2:42:51] <YungxFisher> this reminds me of the old deadliest warriors game that was on xbox 360 but wayyyyy better LUL
[2:42:52] <Gieron667> a sickle
[2:42:55] <whiteblacklight74> arabian swordfighting is really pretty to see
[2:42:58] <+OmegaWeltall> warhammers would be cool.... actual warhammers, not those oversized mauls most games depict as "warhammers"
[2:42:59] <%CommanderSqueaks> Downloaded.
[2:43:02] <whiteblacklight74> with all the swings and twirls
[2:43:04] <DSD24> @YungxFisher That game was so jank!
[2:43:05] <+Grayhammatter> downloaded
[2:43:09] <YungxFisher> IT WAS
[2:43:11] <Ashenik1> @WoolieVersus  you are kindda joking but there was an acutal big movement in Poland fro peasents to use scythe in battle on mass as a last stand from annexation !!
[2:43:12] <Solidnick18> wide open
[2:43:19] <donstylo> I'm 100% the first Mod for this games adds Lightsabers.
[2:43:22] <whiteblacklight74> actual warhammers look more like polearms that big tetsubo
[2:43:27] <michaelpolandwatcher> i dont think he was joking
[2:43:31] <+thedream_c> OH
[2:43:45] <%DashXero> Kinda reminds me of Byleth's cloak.
[2:44:00] <+Shaotanzhiten> Hi, fencer (sport, rather than historical) here. To be honest, you get used to a lot of the circling, though this is a lot larger of a movement than sport foil and sabre fencing is
[2:44:01] <%Exiliator> I remember there was some story where a bunch of farmers beat up mounted knights with clubs w spikes in them, think they were around the Burgundy area.
[2:44:02] <+thedream_c> foot seez
[2:44:07] <michaelpolandwatcher> i have NO IDEA what those are as a history graduate?
[2:44:10] <slix3431> GET INTO HEMA!!!
[2:44:10] <michaelpolandwatcher> xD
[2:44:12] <dukenux> this is just aesthetic, this coat would prolly be removed before a fight
[2:44:17] <dukenux> (no capes)
[2:44:25] <DSD24> As long as the cloak isn't to the floor
[2:44:27] <donstylo> I think it's to distract people like on chinese swords they have a little tail on it to distract and irritate the enemy.
[2:44:34] <Ashenik1> Well he shoud have his winged hussar armour when it comes to battle. Here its just a dual
[2:44:40] <@Menitta> there needs to be more autumn leaves falling
[2:44:47] <+psychonursie_> No more no more ds remake?
[2:44:48] <trashboyee> you just know there are some intense duels going down in that windmill
[2:44:49] <okramv> Ken vs Ryu

[2:53:08] <%Axle13j> Nice
[2:53:13] <+Deleted2972> @wanderingdain90 intentional probably, this game is made by a witcher 3 animator
[2:53:15] <+thedream_c> so the music sorta sounds familiar
[2:53:23] <Louie_Salmon> I thought woolie was playing music from the Witcher 3 until someone just said it was in-game
[2:53:25] <%nakunattakage> @slix3431 they're doing parsec right now, so you can always hop in and give it a shot if you're lucky limesLurk
[2:53:45] <dukenux> that's a lotta blood

[2:59:51] <%Axle13j> I turned away for like a second and missed it lol
[2:59:52] <thunka10> Got that neck on a swivel
[2:59:56] <%Axle13j> the 360
[3:00:04] <Mr_Zero5232> poland got some good music apparently
[3:00:05] <%Jetzord> Good Luck Dash!
[3:00:13] <donstylo> If this game is physic based maybe the reason why some attacks are survivable has something to do with how much weight you put into your attacks.
[3:00:18] <RichochetForce> Marie is almost certainly the Isabella counter
[3:00:21] <+eugas_> @donstylo yes
[3:00:23] <+Shaotanzhiten> Are there any sort of lows or crouching strikes?
[3:00:26] <RichochetForce> But she feels like a small spear user
[3:00:42] <+eugas_> my barabasz survived woolie's marie's stabs cause of my distance to him
[3:00:43] <RichochetForce> @Shaotanzhiten We've seen Isabella have a low rising slash to the head
[3:00:46] <+thedream_c> u need to improve your Marie shmoovment
[3:00:58] <+thedream_c> tipper range
[3:01:02] <thunka10> The french shrug
[3:01:04] <+eugas_> i cannot tech grabs for the life of me in this game
[3:01:12] <DSD24> I like this song
[3:01:13] <%Enemy_In_Disguise> god this music tho
[3:01:22] <therealtacopancakes> nice
[3:01:24] <Kghaleon> Is this Yakuza 7
[3:01:24] <donstylo> I guess Marie has attacks that have little weight into them and thats why her attacks are often not deadly
[3:01:24] <dukenux> o that's impressive
[3:01:27] <+derg0ns> @Shaotanzhiten there are strikes to the legs but those can be dodged easily and leave your head open

[3:02:14] <+RickyDicklander> and why are they losing to that child?
[3:02:21] <+Shaotanzhiten> I guess what I mean is attacks when you're crouching or your position is low, not attacks that strike low, like with rapiers you can lunge our crouch low and aim high for the neck or between the ribs
[3:02:23] <+thedream_c> give us more clips
[3:02:24] <RichochetForce> @RickyDicklander Marie is just a small woman

[3:03:44] <floralkami> @rickydicklander to be frank, I think the average age for most european soldiers were like 15-25, right?
[3:03:45] <Ashenik1> JUST THE TIP
[3:03:48] <+RickyDicklander> @yeehawtom it's actually getting pretty well recognized as being a successor to Bushido Blade, so yeah, it's getting more and more popular
[3:03:49] <dukenux> those finishers where they're still alive are the worst
[3:03:55] <+thedream_c> long sword tip just reaches better
[3:03:58] <%Enemy_In_Disguise> Every hit look painful as hell
[3:03:59] <dukenux> i mean in a good way
[3:04:00] <+RickyDicklander> @floralkami true, pretty messed up tho

[3:04:04] <+Scapeside> Heartseeker
[3:04:12] <+derg0ns> @Shaotanzhiten i don't know much about this game but doing it IRL ruins any chance of defending yourself because you can't move freely after doing it
[3:04:15] <+thedream_c> she BLEEDS
[3:04:19] <+thedream_c> (well obviously)
[3:04:31] <michaelpolandwatcher> DETHRONE HER

[3:05:17] <+thedream_c> yeah Marie is not bout rushdown
[3:05:20] <Ashenik1> I wish German spy was here :/
[3:05:20] <RichochetForce> This is a real ass fighting game
[3:05:21] <+Shaotanzhiten> Yeah, I've done it in fencing matches, low lunges aren't...terrible if you have an arm length advantage anyway, crouches are pretty bad @derg0ns
[3:05:29] <%DashXero> This game is a lot of fun.
[3:05:33] <slix3431> Florida man with sword
[3:05:38] <+thedream_c> no one likes playin the fat guy huh
[3:05:48] <dukenux> oh shit
[3:05:58] <+thedream_c> give it up
[3:05:58] <+Shaotanzhiten> but that was foil on foil or sabre on sabre, so you're not dealing with different weapons
[3:06:03] <%DashXero> Yeah. Kinda.

[3:07:21] <tattleworm> the scimitar guy is olgierd af
[3:07:26] <floralkami> @michaelpolandwatcher I mean, it *was* a 2 handed boardsword
[3:07:26] <Equirah> @floralkami "zweihander" is a fanmade weapon category, just like "bastard" swords
[3:07:26] <%Exiliator> Well your joke was bad Kappa
[3:07:27] <heartlesshealer> let's go, shamshir
[3:07:34] <michaelpolandwatcher> actually ,its a bit short for longsword
[3:07:35] <Dante_Namikaze1> even then silver swords only damage monsters
[3:07:39] <dukenux> is all in jest Woolie, don't worry about it
[3:07:44] <Ashenik1> @dukenux  but they faded away in 18th centuary after Poland had been struck by series of wars and was not able to recruit them anymore Kappa
[3:07:47] <RichochetForce> Isabella has been blessed by The Most High Geralt
[3:08:02] <+thedream_c> oh this is def witcher soundin gmusic
[3:08:05] <+thedream_c> besides the cabin
[3:08:10] <michaelpolandwatcher> @floralkami yeah but its not really broad, and most not horse or shield swords were used with 2
[3:08:12] <+derg0ns> @floralkami Well most sword categories were made up after the fact by historians
[3:08:13] <Louie_Salmon> @dante_namikaze1 I mean it's still a sword, like if you hit someone it would cut them
[3:08:25] <sweet_lil_qt> i'm familiar with the witcher but could anyone explain what a "sword" is
[3:08:34] <+thedream_c> s-words for 500 alex
[3:08:37] <Ashenik1> isnt bastard sword something between one-hand and two-handed sword?
[3:08:46] <slix3431> @WoolieVersus One of the things you may have noticed is Isabella holds her sword with both hands. It's effective length is longer than most sabres
[3:08:47] <Dante_Namikaze1> @louie_salmon in the game it's like trying to cut somebody with a plastic toy knife
[3:08:51] <+thedream_c> grapplers :(
[3:08:52] <%Exiliator> @sweet_lil_qt It's called a Western-Katana thank you very much
[3:08:57] <floralkami> @derg0ns huh, then I'm calling swords whatever I want, lol
[3:09:09] <michaelpolandwatcher> @Ashenik1 i heard the other day that its actually a modern therm and middle ages didnt see a diferenc
[3:09:09] <+thedream_c> thats his range
[3:09:10] <Ashenik1> @Exiliator  LUL
[3:09:12] <floralkami> @michaelpolandwatcher true, I was being a turd
[3:09:13] <heartlesshealer> hand and a half sword is the bastard sword. Built for ease of switching between one-handed and two-handed wielding
[3:09:13] <RichochetForce> Ackshually, it's called a West Asian Long Uchigatana
[3:09:15] <sweet_lil_qt> @Exiliator oh now i get it thanks!!
[3:09:35] <dukenux> "Western katana" is whatever sabre that's made from damascian steel
[3:09:50] <Equirah> @Ashenik1 bastard sword is simply a sword whose origin is unknown (metal league or design). it simply means "a foreign sword we do not know the source of"
[3:09:50] <T_Sasquatch> longsword all the way
[3:09:54] <+thedream_c> shamshur
[3:09:54] <NeoMiami> gg
[3:09:56] <T_Sasquatch> simply and straight
[3:09:59] <+loukemia83> Mercutio is a badass
[3:10:00] <RichochetForce> Dexy Reggie
[3:10:01] <+derg0ns> @floralkami they literally just called swords swords back then, Italians literally just used one handed two-handed swords to categorize things
[3:10:06] <DSD24> I like Rapiers
[3:10:28] <Mr_Zero5232> the term Rapier itself covers so many swords it'll take a DLC to cover them
[3:10:28] <+MisterCrimson> they need a big Turk with one of those fat, fuck-off scimitars
[3:10:29] <MrRumdum> i actually find rapier more exhausting than longsword because you gotta hold that shit with one hand only
[3:10:34] <Varanoo> AWKWARD PAUSE
[3:10:38] <Ashenik1> Didnt rapier destroy samurai katana when Portugese mechants encoutered Samurais? Kappa
[3:10:47] <Arek_1> There are both hand-and-a-half swords and bastard swords. The former is closer to the single-handed arming sword. The later to the two-handed longsword. And there's also the warsword, the longest that the longsword can go before going into greatsword territory. But the umbrella term is longsword.
[3:10:57] <floralkami> @ashenik1 I miss Deadliest Warrior
[3:11:05] <Twin_Hallow> I like what most ppl think of whne ya say rapier then
[3:11:08] <heartlesshealer> @Ashenik1 that's because of iron quality, if true
[3:11:09] <RichochetForce> @Ashenik1 Is that true? I've always heard Samurai didn't fare well against the few Europeans they encountered
[3:11:10] <Varanoo> @Ashenik1 Yes, why do you ask Kappa ?

[3:14:13] <+Titanium__Falcon> @floralkami no lmao I'm just sayin
[3:14:16] <+thedream_c> oh yeah sometimes if u hit the face you can dizzy them?
[3:14:23] <+thedream_c> punch em I mean
[3:14:24] <RichochetForce> O
[3:14:33] <RichochetForce> I've seen Isabella smash the pommel into their face
[3:14:46] <ElPlasa> @Titanium__Falcon kinda, it's basically using your sword like a lance so you could theoretically use it for anything

[3:15:05] <+thedream_c> but that rushdown tho
[3:15:09] <tattleworm> you were poking her ear

[3:16:02] <+Dreadlord134> Nobodies playing the two guys on the ends
[3:16:06] <+Titanium__Falcon> @ElPlasa I thought the point was more control over the blade, so you could pierce gaps in armored foes
[3:16:16] <T_Sasquatch> @Dreadlord134 they cant
[3:16:22] <@Menitta> The two end guys are locked
[3:16:26] <+Dreadlord134> Oh
[3:16:39] <+Dreadlord134> Didn‚Äôt see that
[3:16:42] <Arek_1> Wasters.
[3:16:43] <heartlesshealer> nice touch for practice
[3:16:45] <RichochetForce> Ah yes, KENDO
[3:16:52] <RichochetForce> I knew this was a Japanese game

[3:17:01] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> they still do sparks LUL
[3:17:05] <%Jetzord> Yo the SFX on those are nice

[3:17:09] <dinnydanny777> time for parking lot Kingdom Hearts reenactments
[3:17:11] <Mr_Zero5232> that wooden sword hurt like fuck tho
[3:17:14] <RichochetForce> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ Those are wooden sparks, you see.
[3:17:37] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @RichochetForce ah, it all makes sense now
[3:17:55] <Applecannon63> the sparks are the durability of the wooden sword
[3:18:06] <floralkami> damn, getting stabbed with a wooden sword ain't much less painful, I'll tell you that for free
[3:18:20] <LinguineBobini> this game looks sick
[3:18:24] <emeraldskrull> *poke* teeheehee
[3:18:36] <Mr_Zero5232> her victory pose was everything
[3:18:38] <Equirah> @floralkami getting stabbed with anything really if it punctures LUL
[3:18:39] <heartlesshealer> those were clean torso hits, so that probably helps
[3:18:39] <Twin_Hallow> I always wonder what it feels like ot be stabbed but dont think ill test it out
[3:18:42] <dukenux> TIL Claymore is both a name for a scottish longsword and a scottish rapier
[3:18:45] <ClayProof> There is a way to activate the health-stamina bar @woolieversus
[3:19:03] <VladDamien> Knicks? I don't see any Mango Sentinel here
[3:19:20] <dukenux> "Just drop your weapon down and walk away"
[3:19:23] <$Nested_Dreams> @clayproof They know, but it turns off on every match and the keyboard is away
[3:19:26] <Equirah> @Twin_Hallow depends on what you're stabbed with, where and how deep
[3:19:32] <Roasted_Pheasant> How many knicks kills? I'm seeing people tank 4 or more
[3:19:36] <floralkami> @equirah oh no, I mean during sparring. used to take kendo pokes during Karate to practice defending.
[3:19:49] <Applecannon63> Tip the greatest Marth hit box
[3:20:19] <Arek_1> @dukenux To differentiate, I've seen some call the Scottish basket-hilted broadsword a claybeg.

[3:20:54] <%DashXero> Yep.
[3:21:05] <%cobalt_phoenix_> style switching?
[3:21:05] <RichochetForce> It looks like that
[3:21:08] <%DashXero> Isabella has a really nice knee in close.
[3:21:14] <Equirah> @floralkami that's not stabbing, that's blunt force trauma DansGame
[3:22:12] <floralkami> @equirah shut up before I show YOU some blunt force trauma

[3:22:49] <Crowroost> Muhuhaha, NOROI.
[3:23:35] <toahmes> they both wore the same shoes and neither wants to change
[3:23:39] <dinnydanny777> limesMusic
[3:24:01] <floralkami> I don't usually like realism in video games, but this is a great looking graphical style.
[3:24:11] <+JumboCrunchies> Honestly this looks.. surprisingly cool
[3:24:23] <BabyNaBackbrace> wow it's really fun
[3:24:28] <dukenux> the whole selling point is realistic sword fighting, so the looks follow
[3:24:44] <LinguineBobini> is this game gonna get rollback
[3:24:44] <+JumboCrunchies> They both have such tall socks
[3:24:45] <Mr_Zero5232> this game is kinda a lesson to why games need advertising and sponsoring streamers, because if it weren't for Skallagrim I wouldn't even know Hellish Quart existed, and apparently others wouldn't know if not for Woolie streaming it now
[3:24:47] <Applecannon63> this fight looks way choreographed to be real
[3:24:58] <floralkami> I love the way the light hits the clothes. they are bright, but not shiny. slightly faded like they should be, real warrior garments
[3:25:03] <RichochetForce> Disarmed
[3:25:03] <Darren716> Man this music is super Witchery
[3:25:10] <Saltmeisterr> advertising is hella expensive man
[3:25:20] <Saltmeisterr> some people just can't afford it
[3:25:27] <Mr_Zero5232> word of mouth tho
[3:25:34] <RichochetForce> Yeah, big games often drop 15-30% of their budget on ads
[3:25:37] <floralkami> @mr_zero5232 yeah, I heard about it but thought it was still in dev, not in early access
[3:25:43] <Mr_Zero5232> get people talkin
[3:25:45] <RichochetForce> Word of mouth is better for small titles. See: Hollow Knight
[3:25:47] <dukenux> this looks like a passion project of a group of people, id assume the budget is harmstrung
[3:25:50] <BabyNaBackbrace> The old guy has a mean style and Marie is great
[3:25:52] <Mr_Zero5232> @floralkami same
[3:26:22] <Applecannon63> LET'S Nuuuuuuu
[3:26:36] <$Nested_Dreams> @richochetforce Hmm, don't know if Hollow Knight can be considered small, but I guess we will k ow when the subopena comes through
[3:26:36] <%Pillagius> who's winning?
[3:26:39] <RichochetForce> Yeah, small slashes actually destroy your stamina
[3:26:44] <Applecannon63> Framerate Kappa
[3:26:54] <therealtacopancakes> Ooooh
[3:27:01] <%Double_Tap_That> En garde!
[3:27:03] <RichochetForce> @Nested_Dreams Hollow Knight had almost no marketing. It got big off quality + word of mouth
[3:27:03] <Darren716> Oof
[3:27:09] <+chicken_danger> bonjour
[3:27:14] <dukenux> One for all
[3:27:18] <RichochetForce> Vive? Yes. La France? Not so much
[3:27:25] <therealtacopancakes> So where is isabella from? Spain, England?
[3:27:26] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:27:33] <Mr_Zero5232> in order for people to buy the thing, they have to be told the thing exists
[3:27:34] <Saltmeisterr> my guess spain
[3:27:36] <BlackermanZX> Isabella is gonna get nerfed
[3:27:37] <dukenux> Isabella of Spain
[3:27:39] <RichochetForce> @therealtacopancakes Probably spain
[3:27:45] <floralkami> @dukenux I know, but I mean the way everything looks. this could've easily been bootlegged with basic unity assets, but it looks like they really took their time making everything fit, even the grime
[3:27:51] <slix3431> @therealtacopancakes What englishwoman is named isabella at this period?
[3:27:51] <RichochetForce> Isabella is straight up the name of the famous Queen of Spain
[3:27:52] <%Pillagius> great arena - hanging out with boyz!
[3:28:02] <dinnydanny777> That stab had comedic timing LUL

[3:28:25] <BabyNaBackbrace> wow
[3:28:33] <therealtacopancakes> In spanish it's Isabel. not bella
[3:28:34] <dinnydanny777> Sweep the leg
[3:28:45] <dukenux> @floralkami like i said, passion project. plus someone in the chat said, the head of the team is a former witcher animator, which explains why animations look so that
[3:28:45] <floralkami> @dukenux this feels like what I would want from games with "cinematic gameplay."
[3:28:46] <Varanoo> Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[3:28:46] <+chicken_danger> you take my hat i take your life
[3:28:48] <%Pillagius> behated?
[3:28:48] <dukenux> *so good
[3:28:52] <Equirah> @therealtacopancakes she cn be Italian
[3:28:55] <+loukemia83> I feel like this game could use stage interactables, like toss chairs and rocks at your opponent
[3:29:11] <floralkami> @dukenux oh really? that explains a lot
[3:29:14] <BabyNaBackbrace> someone smudges your shoes or your hat: greater offense?
[3:29:19] <therealtacopancakes> @therealtacopancakes Yeh, I think I like Italy more for her
[3:29:24] <goose_coward> this is some bushido blade shit hell yeah
[3:29:25] <%Enemy_In_Disguise> let gedeon throw his mug as a projectile
[3:29:34] <%Double_Tap_That> I can totally see this game get DLC that includes other cultures.
[3:29:48] <$thomassolorio> u 2 close and choke him out like y clef Jon and dylon
[3:29:53] <Varanoo> Hail the spanish queen!
[3:30:06] <TheShockVox> Erm. Erm. This game is lame for the sole lack of the glorious honorable superior katana (oh, I‚Äôm sorry to all Baka-Bakas, I mean ‚ÄúJapanese sword‚Äù). Erm. Kinda cringe? Sue-me-my-send
[3:30:18] <floralkami> @babynabackbrace damn, tough call... and shit ain't easy to clean, no matter the material
[3:30:34] <floralkami> @theshockvox yabai
[3:30:36] <+chicken_danger> to be fair the katana would be op (its folded over 1000 times)
[3:30:36] <Mr_Zero5232> @theshockvox. I respect the troll
[3:30:36] <Varanoo> SPAIN WINS
[3:30:41] <Varanoo> Kreygasm
[3:30:44] <dukenux> The game seems to stick to a limited time period
[3:30:45] <thepenguinprince> This game looks super cool, and brutal
[3:30:46] <+RobinFoDays> @TheShockVox Its called a weeb stick
[3:30:49] <%Pillagius> woolie came in like a wreaking ball
[3:30:52] <RichochetForce> Damn, even with Marie Isabella has to be respected
[3:30:57] <TheShockVox> @robinfodays Oooo that‚Äôs good
[3:30:58] <dukenux> but i'd really like to see a guy with a danish axe here
[3:31:12] <%Jetzord> Melee tech right there
[3:31:18] <RichochetForce> Incroyable
[3:31:18] <dukenux> Skywalker'd
[3:31:20] <+JumboCrunchies> That hand came right off
[3:31:31] <Ironic_giant21> his smile
[3:31:32] <dukenux> @JumboCrunchies "Your hand comes off?"
[3:31:32] <RichochetForce> Yipes, that was Brutal
[3:31:37] <Mr_Zero5232> @dukenux why wouldn't they put the danish axe in later? have they said they wouldn't?
[3:31:37] <Applecannon63> Why aren't there a Pole arm fighter?
[3:31:39] <%Exiliator> @dukenux Would be a bit out of time

[3:31:45] <TheShockVox> @mr_zero5232 Thank you. I‚Äôll put myself on blast, I‚Äôm worried 10 year old me might‚Äôve actually thought the lack of katanas would be a bummer.
[3:31:55] <BabyNaBackbrace> special guest DLC : Oh Dae Su and his hammer from Old Boy
[3:31:57] <BlackermanZX> gawd damn LUL
[3:31:59] <wanderingdain90> right in two
[3:32:02] <RichochetForce> Low... that goes high
[3:32:02] <therealtacopancakes> I wanna see some Greek Klephts in this added later
[3:32:03] <floralkami> holy shit, I would LOVE to see some real either East African and/or Caribbean combat styles, bruh
[3:32:07] <+chicken_danger> zweihander when
[3:32:10] <dukenux> @Mr_Zero5232 i don't know, but judging from the looks of the fighters, they all hail from around XVIIc.
[3:32:13] <%cobalt_phoenix_> this game looks cool
[3:32:16] <+Awkward_Cyborg> nice Spanish Reggie!
[3:32:18] <dukenux> a bit too late for bearded axes
[3:32:22] <RichochetForce> Wow, Reggie with the Spanish
[3:32:28] <floralkami> GIVE ME THE PENIS SWORD
[3:32:37] <%DashXero> She's got the look. She's got the moves. She's got the range.
[3:32:38] <wanderingdain90> Sephiroth DLC when
[3:32:45] <+chicken_danger> brock lesnar dlc with the dick sword
[3:32:57] <%DashXero> 16 bucks.
[3:32:58] <slix3431> 20
[3:33:00] <%cobalt_phoenix_> 17
[3:33:02] <%Exiliator> Polish Com was around 16th to 17th
[3:33:02] <Ironic_giant21> $17
[3:33:31] <Mr_Zero5232> @dukenux I mean the games still early, no set time has been set so why not have that as a special DLC far later
[3:33:37] <BlackermanZX> It looks pretty fun
[3:33:39] <RichochetForce> This looks STRONG
[3:33:54] <%DashXero> I like it better than Bushido Blade, honestly.
[3:33:54] <%SeventhVice> SeventhVice subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! Hey Woolie!  When's the live song-by-song review of the 13 Sentinels Remix album??
[3:33:56] <OldManDeckardCain> just get this a rollback netcode LUL
[3:34:01] <goose_coward> Bushido Blade vibes
[3:34:03] <RichochetForce> Good call
[3:34:09] <T_Sasquatch> rip nidhogg
[3:34:14] <dukenux> @Mr_Zero5232 im just saying i don't know the plans devs have. they might expand timeline if game becomes popular
[3:34:18] <+chicken_danger> an actual nidhogg mode with this would be dope
[3:34:20] <T_Sasquatch> killed itself for using the shittiest character art ever
[3:34:31] <RichochetForce> Fucking Nidhogg 2, ugh
[3:34:31] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:34:34] <+loukemia83> How do they fuck up Nidhogg 2 so bad
[3:34:35] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oooh
[3:34:35] <Mr_Zero5232> @dukenux but it's based on HEMA not a timeline, that covers an entire continent of blades and styles that weren't just around a characters fashion
[3:34:43] <%Jetzord> Ooh
[3:34:46] <OldManDeckardCain> @T_Sasquatch yall just don't appreaciate their true vision Kappa
[3:34:56] <T_Sasquatch> @loukemia83 the sad part is that the enviroment design is fucking gorgeous
[3:35:03] <TheShockVox> Story? Damn.
[3:35:10] <@Menitta> That'd be wild because it just means only one person needs to buy it
[3:35:25] <Mr_Zero5232> we're talking what a couple thousand years worth of weapon styles, why limit your game to two or three years
[3:35:36] <dukenux> @Mr_Zero5232 i dont know enough about HEMA or the game dev to speak on that *shrug*
[3:35:40] <heartlesshealer> only one person with a good connection
[3:36:05] <Mr_Zero5232> @dukenux neither do I but it's just history
[3:36:16] <dukenux> damn, wonder when they'll make it illegal Kappa
[3:36:18] <BlackermanZX> -Branched- remix album yes
[3:36:21] <%Exiliator> Ok but does it have BLITZ NETCODE?
[3:36:21] <TheShockVox> Off topic, I really hope the botches that were SFV story mode and Tekken 7 story mode don‚Äôt discourage other fighting games (including SF and Tekken) from doing more (and improving)
[3:36:22] <BlackermanZX> Its so damn good
