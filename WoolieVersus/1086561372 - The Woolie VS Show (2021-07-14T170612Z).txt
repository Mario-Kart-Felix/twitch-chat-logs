[0:13:08] <andre11dr> Oh shit i just realized today is the church
[0:13:28] <leith_aziz> I havent kept up with the Disco Elyisuim playthrough in a while. I couldnt keep up with the streams then it got too much
[0:13:28] <andre11dr> which means will see THAT scene
[0:13:38] <leith_aziz> *Elysium
[0:13:54] <%krispen_wa> he's got A LOT of things to do, so not necessarily the church

[0:15:34] <leith_aziz> Hello
[0:15:41] <%wolfofsound> hey captainpaledriver
[0:15:44] <%CaptainPileDriver> so, remember dsp?
[0:15:49] <andre11dr> No
[0:15:54] <%holydeviant1> @CaptainPileDriver where are you going with this
[0:15:59] <spaceitaly> what has dsp done now
[0:16:00] <leith_aziz> @CaptainPileDriver He wasnt the actual antagonist, no?
[0:16:00] <%wolfofsound> I try to forget him
[0:16:04] <%CaptainPileDriver> found an hour long video talking about his twitch money raising scam shit
[0:16:05] <spaceitaly> is he dead?
[0:16:05] <stardustcrusad3r> @ProducerMatt42 <3 <3 <3
[0:16:11] <%CaptainPileDriver> i say scam but like
[0:16:11] <leith_aziz> DSP? I try to forget him
[0:16:13] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's really fucky

[0:17:02] <%wolfofsound> on a totally opposite note does anyone want to work for marykay? I make so much doing it!
[0:17:22] <stardustcrusad3r> DSP is the idea of evil cant die
[0:17:53] <leith_aziz> @stardustcrusad3r It's best to just ignore it. Those types of people tend to dig their own graves in terms of sucess
[0:17:57] <andre11dr> Like David Cage has fallen before DSP that man is not human
[0:18:02] <%CaptainPileDriver> he's the best example of anyone can be successful

Its not that I CANT enjoy a game a huge asshole as a protagonist, but it makes it significantly harder for me. It feels to good to be good. I feel gross being bad, even in games.

[0:30:09] <leith_aziz> I really wanted to buy Titanfall 2, but hackers gallore right now
[0:30:10] <%DatAsuna> Wolfenstein's pretty decent arcadey shooter
[0:30:18] <+livingdynamo> wolfenstein is such a banger of a series man
[0:30:23] <leith_aziz> Shame, cause I loved my time with Titanfall 2 on console
[0:30:25] <andre11dr> Just make sure is New Order, not the older 2008 one
[0:30:38] <primaryfire> gotta do our yearly flushing out the nazis in the audience
[0:30:41] <%krispen_wa> WHENS BLAZBLUE LORE WOOLIE
[0:30:42] <leith_aziz> Honetly, you can just play New Order and Old Blood
[0:30:44] <+livingdynamo> i know a lot of people have gripes with the new colossus but i bet woolie would be sold if he saw the axe executioners
[0:30:45] <%bumpynavel> @trace_bovier I've seen it, it's interesting for a little bit but becomes too much quickly.
[0:30:57] <mrhappy6677> Yeah Woolie's gotta go binge Jojolion now Kappa
[0:31:02] <%dds333a> @krispen_wa when he gets paid for it Kappa
[0:31:04] <leith_aziz> I kinda agree
[0:31:12] <%dds333a> I don't
[0:31:15] <+Jiggisnipe> that makes sense
[0:31:16] <OfficerMods> disco is wrapping up anyways
[0:31:18] <leith_aziz> But I dont mind seeing a new perspective IF there's a point
[0:31:20] <Josef_Stryker> I can't bring myself to be Renegade
[0:31:26] <%krispen_wa> Playing Evil in KOTOR I is the only way to play the game
[0:31:29] <Josef_Stryker> I can do Paragade at best
[0:31:35] <%Irridium> I don't want to make the imaginary people sad
[0:31:42] <%bumpynavel> Glorifying the badness
[0:31:42] <leith_aziz> Like, if im just an asshole for the sake of being an asshole. I cant do that
[0:31:43] <gfkxj> I wish games made being the bad guy more interesting, alot of the times doing the evil option is just more boring option of you killed everyone.
[0:31:50] <%eanscrale> The art direction is saying that the psychopath is just, and in fact not a bad person
[0:31:50] <iacus_> The Kratos tone
[0:31:51] <+coolthulhuu> I like being a hero :)
[0:31:52] <leith_aziz> Basically Fatalities and why I hate them
[0:32:03] <%khalcipher> Thats the problem i have with GTA
[0:32:05] <Picia000123> So, slave free chocolate, huh
[0:32:06] <andre11dr> I mean one of my favorite shows ever is Shin Getter Robo and the protagonist is OBJECTIVELY not a good person in that
[0:32:07] <Chatterbox1991> the difference between Spec Ops: the Line and God of War 3
[0:32:14] <iacus_> More like when the directos says "Yeah, it's a bad person, but that's badass!"
[0:32:14] <%CaptainPileDriver> man, the dolphin salt continues to be real
[0:32:16] <crunchington001> Dragon Age Origins is a great example of a game where you can play as an utter scumbag all the way through and still save the world
[0:32:25] <%krispen_wa> I did a renegade run of ME1 and ME2 and surprisingly its not too much different. its getting the same results in a more badass way. its ME3 renegade thats dumb
[0:32:35] <%dds333a> Woah
[0:32:35] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1414834352052215808?s=19
[0:32:37] <leith_aziz> Like Peak Example
[0:32:58] <%CaptainPileDriver> kratos is a dumb moron that causes problems cause waaah mee
[0:33:04] <leith_aziz> SOTL makes you feel like shit
[0:33:11] <%MightyDuckShoes> ARES!!!!
[0:33:12] <%DatAsuna> @krispen_wa ME1 renegade is you wanting a human fascist coup that dominates all other races, you just don't get it
[0:33:12] <AngryAsian5> My first playthrough of an RPG is usually as the ultra-good person. After that, my other playthroughs play around with morality more for funsies.
[0:33:20] <gfkxj> I was trying to make you into a great warrior.... YOU SUCCEDED
[0:33:22] <zanzibarian_hamster> You don't get CHEEVO UNLOCKED for firebombing all the civvies
[0:33:22] <Equirah> White Phsopherous! Wooooo \o/
[0:33:25] <WeepyDevil> spec ops doesn't give you cool willy pete comboes
[0:33:27] <leith_aziz> @CaptainPileDriver It's more to prove the issue with the GOW mythology gods
[0:33:31] <+illusiveSaint> i couldn't finish finish spec ops the gameplay was too generic for me but i respect the story
[0:33:32] <%illtima> Spec Ops doens't try to make you sympathize with Walker. Whatever they say about GoW3, they absolutely try to make Kratos likable with the whole Pandora thing
[0:33:37] <%DatAsuna> Funnily, while ash is way into that, Kaidan becomes that if you're renegade, then if you switch paragon he's very confused
[0:33:45] <%eanscrale> Light em all up!
[0:33:49] <+toastybites> Nero does skateboard tricks on a hellfire missile pointed at a wedding
[0:33:57] <OfficerMods> good guy kratos bringing hope to a broken world
[0:34:14] <+livingdynamo> plus spec ops shows you that walker is truly deranged
[0:34:17] <%DatAsuna> I don't play these games with my own morality. I get a read on the origin of the character like a writing prompt, and then I decide the morality of the character from there.
[0:34:18] <+livingdynamo> mannequin boss fight lmao
[0:34:25] <%dds333a> It won't
[0:34:27] <andre11dr> I'm don't have problems with having a immoral protagonist, but when i feel that the scene itself is immoral or in bad taste, that's when you lose me @woolieversus
[0:34:30] <linSP> choose your morals
[0:34:35] <%bumpynavel> I played "boring harry" in Disco. it's still really good and it was actually a really touching and sad story that way, even if it isn't as funny.
[0:34:49] <%dds333a> @bumpynavel true
[0:35:00] <leith_aziz> @illtima Well, that didnt work in the end cause Pandora died and at that point it was just Kratos being at peace with himself. The issue is that he came to that conclusion once he killed everything. AT least it ties into GOW 2018 well
[0:35:01] <WeepyDevil> yeah like...spartans are assholes, Kratos not having modern morality is fine
[0:35:05] <+Jiggisnipe> *stream breaks*
[0:35:09] <mrhappy6677> Ok so no jojolion spoilers got it
[0:35:09] <SivSarcast> And now I slep. Will catch the vod in the morning.
[0:35:18] <%krispen_wa> Destroy All Humans is the experience where you play as an asshole
[0:35:24] <%krispen_wa> the best experience
[0:35:29] <+mczarklesby> I think Deltarune is going to be a meta-narrative about the weight of expectation of making a follow up to Undertale.
[0:35:32] <WeepyDevil> but og kratos is incredibly fucking terrible even compared to historical spartans
[0:35:38] <JetpackMcQuack> big bombshell
[0:35:38] <OfficerMods> I played harry close to myself and got boring art cop. and boy is that dead on
[0:36:23] <leith_aziz> I'm the kinda guy who hates Fatalities because of what it represenets as the game trying REALLY hard to seem more "mature" than its competitors
[0:36:27] <AnneSQF> that reddit thread was a mess
[0:36:29] <dukenux> @weepydevil atleast he didn't diddle kids(afaik)
[0:36:38] <%wolfofsound> wolfofsound subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months! In honor of my 23 months subbed I have my finger up my ass
[0:36:39] <leith_aziz> Also the fact that the devs get PTSD from the research
[0:36:42] <andre11dr> See that GoW shit i don't even think it was trying to be come of that fucked up , i think it was just trying to be edgy
[0:36:43] <%krispen_wa> there should have been a second wheel where kratos kills an evil dude at the same time to balance the door mechanism
[0:36:54] <he1lhydra> whaaaaat? people on the internet talking past eachother? impossible D:
[0:36:58] <OblivionSword1> hope it works
[0:37:04] <%dds333a> @leith_aziz it sure didn't always try to be serious.
[0:37:16] <heemwizard> wow you guys started a lot earlier this time
[0:37:22] <guiltyboya> gogogo
[0:37:26] <%krispen_wa> HARDCOOOOOORE
[0:37:27] <OfficerMods> I don't think ed boon puts fatalities in the game to be mature. I think he does it cuz its fucking sick
[0:37:32] <WeepyDevil> @dukenux he went to whorehouses, so even if he didn't pracisce pederastry, he probably didled kids, given the age of people who would be working at brothels in the historical equivalent to GoW's time
[0:37:35] <%TheotherKristian> No twitch help?
[0:37:36] <+Captain_Spicy_> HARDCORE TO THE MEGA
[0:37:39] <Saltmeisterr> heyo people
[0:37:42] <linSP> Dicks go elysium!
[0:37:44] <leith_aziz> GOW2 basically ended with Kratos declaring that he'll kill Zeus no matter who's in the way. But I still agree with your point that the devs went too far in some aspects
[0:37:44] <Saltmeisterr> whats happenin
[0:37:45] <linSP> Disco*

[1:00:14] <%eanscrale> yo that suit and loafers isn't the only thing that's green
[1:00:15] <+airchrysalis> Kim is probably the only Seolite RCM officer in Revachol
[1:00:16] <%Juriasu> he called you officers when you met
[1:00:19] <CinnamonAppleJacks> it's an insane thought
[1:00:19] <sushahana> low reaction speed
[1:00:22] <Blackleafx> this is encyclopedia stuff
[1:00:25] <andre11dr> Kim is just a baller like that
[1:00:26] <plsnolookatme> @Pt_Kamen do you think Woolie will ever figure out what Half Brother means in this context?
[1:00:33] <elshadow7> Good thought, but Woolie's Encyclopedia is not that high right?
[1:00:34] <+illusiveSaint> atpShh
[1:00:34] <zanzibarian_hamster> @airchrysalis Kim is from Revachol though

[1:01:08] <Blackleafx> Many thoughts
[1:01:11] <+airchrysalis> @zanzibarian_hamster but his ancestors are not from Revakol
[1:01:14] <%khalcipher> You gotta be careful with what you choose
[1:01:14] <Miklosher> superstar?
[1:01:16] <zanzibarian_hamster> Wompty dompty domp is the sound a drunk guy makes when walking in an old cartoon
[1:01:19] <+Jeshk0> everybody got make choooices
[1:01:24] <+anoldtoilet> this is like the advanced version of art degree
[1:01:25] <Pt_Kamen> @Odinhasnobooty nope, probably not even in the end game unless someone explains Esprit du corps
[1:01:26] <Blackleafx> @airchrysalis cringe
[1:01:28] <+anoldtoilet> its a whole art gallery
[1:01:29] <%wolfofsound> @zanzibarian_hamster nice
[1:01:31] <+anoldtoilet> LUL
[1:01:33] <heysamuel> i would dump white mourning myself

[1:01:46] <skyenoz> what does indotribe do again?
[1:01:50] <serioustguy> you dont really need wompty dom centere
[1:01:50] <+anoldtoilet> doesnt white mourning have some affect on the ending
[1:01:51] <elshadow7> White mourning probs
[1:01:51] <heemwizard> get rid of art degree
[1:01:53] <+Vivaciousx3> they dont raise the actual skill
[1:01:55] <Blackleafx> Should we tell Woolie that theres one thought he REALLY wants to get
[1:01:56] <andre11dr> Or you could just not internalize every thought you see, just saying
[1:01:57] <d41caesar> Yeah, White Mourning is the worst of these.
[1:01:59] <heemwizard> you need COMPOSURE
[1:02:00] <+anoldtoilet> those dont stay, yeah those caps go back down
[1:02:02] <Blackleafx> considering his playstyle
[1:02:11] <elshadow7> @heemwizard Art degree is H/E
[1:02:18] <plsnolookatme> @Pt_Kamen I have low expectations tbh. I remember when Pat told encyclopedia to f-off when it was about to explain the whole RCM/ICM origins
[1:02:23] <Blackleafx> bop
[1:02:29] <plsnolookatme> SO MUCH LORE so easily missed
[1:02:32] <Pt_Kamen> Esprit de Corps get a bit ignored unless it goes on long rants
[1:02:45] <dukenux> still doesnt look bad
[1:02:47] <%Juriasu> I don't think I've seen you zoom out even once, it is a cool thing to be able to do though
[1:03:06] <plsnolookatme> @Blackleafx which thought?

[1:07:28] <plsnolookatme> Woolie better lay them pheromones on THICK
[1:07:33] <%holydeviant1> He's actually quite realistic on his field, it's refreshing

[1:07:46] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:07:49] <%doomerskeletor13> Well some cryptozoologists work to debunk claims rather than prove them
[1:07:51] <kingra> Implying something is gonna happen is the same as spoilering it chat
[1:08:00] <%eanscrale> You might be surprised, the Gorilla was once considered a cryptid.
[1:08:08] <zanzibarian_hamster> There have been some confrimed cryptids, the kellas cat for one, though to be fair that's just a really big black cat in scotland
[1:08:19] <+anoldtoilet> thank you morell
[1:08:23] <+ReallyBigRocks> there are events in this game that have yet to occur
[1:08:23] <Blackleafx> @eanscrale A lot of creatures to be fair. Esp old fossilized ones
[1:08:26] <zhukis> phaaaaaaaaaasmid
[1:08:39] <+anoldtoilet> the fuckling worldbuilding and lore in this game are so good
[1:08:44] <Blackleafx> Coelacanths for instance
[1:08:54] <%wolfofsound> rock me phantasmada
[1:08:58] <+fugatlas> das an allllieeeeeen
[1:09:05] <+anoldtoilet> even stupid bugs that dont matter have cool lore
[1:09:08] <dukenux> i feel like cryptids is the least crazy of all the consoiracy stuff, still a bit silly
[1:09:09] <heysamuel> i would kill for more works in this universe (in english, i know about the book already)
[1:09:11] <Blackleafx> Evolved to protect against scientists
[1:09:19] <Blackleafx> PERSEPTION

[1:10:25] <%wolfofsound> ah yes unrefutably second and third hand accounts
[1:10:27] <Blackleafx> its post-soviet eastern europe by way of France
[1:10:43] <WeepyDevil> @wolfofsound he mentioned first hadn
[1:10:50] <%doomerskeletor13> His white whale
[1:10:52] <andre11dr> Now don't get me wrong, i don't believe that all cryptids are bullshit, but it's when where getting to bigfoot and Lochnes and shit like that ,that's when i start laughing at you
[1:11:04] <%Dio_TR> Kappa
[1:11:06] <%wolfofsound> @WeepyDevil I know but why mention the others?
[1:11:07] <%holydeviant1> ...oh, that line makes a lot more sense later.
[1:11:07] <dukenux> ^
[1:11:18] <+anoldtoilet> all conspiracy theory stuff is just harmless fun if i ts not about interpreting race statistics
[1:11:21] <justcallmebobplease> Man, if only Woolie can remember this when he gets to the ending portion
[1:11:28] <Blackleafx> @andre11dr loch ness is wild, its a tiny as fuck lake, no way something can hide there

[1:11:44] <+Afrobrawler> relax guys
[1:11:47] <%holydeviant1> clear out the spoilers
[1:11:51] <zanzibarian_hamster> Apparently shit like gorilla, komodo dragon and platipus used to be (technically) cryptids
[1:11:59] <%vaderxyz1970> I though Lockness monster was whale dick?
[1:12:01] <a_bald_bro> shut up chat so annoying

[1:15:27] <%doomerskeletor13> Gary is such a great idea for a character, because it’s true that these conspiracy fields often attract those type of people, or even radicalize them
[1:15:38] <Fuji808> @vaderxyz1970 Ultracapitalists are insects for sure.
[1:15:38] <zanzibarian_hamster> @vaderxyz1970 No, that's a confirmed scientific phenomenom in this universe

[1:16:47] <heysamuel> i really like that answer tbh

[1:21:25] <%wolfofsound> @ingman112 @MightyDuckShoes oh for parts of the stream sure, but all stream? We just need one mod

[1:21:50] <%doomerskeletor13> that’s a lot of work my man
[1:21:52] <%MightyDuckShoes> @wolfofsound YOU implied it to be for All the stream.
[1:21:52] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:21:52] <Blackleafx> FOR SCIENCE
[1:21:53] <andre11dr> LUL
[1:21:55] <%vaderxyz1970> @ryuuaoi in a perfect world....
[1:21:56] <OblivionSword1> LUL
[1:21:58] <+ppangboi> at least its sorta clever??
[1:21:58] <ingman112> Shit I'll mod it up, I don't give a fuck. You see a spoiler, ban the person
[1:21:59] <dukenux> LUL
[1:22:00] <+anoldtoilet> it might have been non toxic
[1:22:01] <OblivionSword1> POLLUTION FOR SCIENCE
[1:22:02] <dinnydanny777> Poisoning the wildlife to find Bigfoot
[1:22:02] <%krispen_wa> @elshadow7 you think the evil apes duking over a disco ball can moderate THEMSELVES?
[1:22:03] <ingman112> Seems pretty simple to me
[1:22:06] <andre11dr> FOR SCIENCE
[1:22:09] <primaryfire> I fucking hate people who think they're slick by implying spoilers
[1:22:10] <+anoldtoilet> anyone who volunteers to be a mod should never be a mod
[1:22:12] <+Tuffty> From what I saw, someone asked a question and then someone else just outright spoiled something big in response to it
[1:22:12] <%wolfofsound> @MightyDuckShoes because it happens ALL stream
[1:22:14] <+anoldtoilet> thats like a hard internet rule
[1:22:17] <RyuuAoi> @vaderxyz1970 This is America...
[1:22:18] <heysamuel> kim lmfao
[1:22:22] <zanzibarian_hamster> Paint known for being spectacular for the health of trees
[1:22:25] <%doomerskeletor13> Imagine this guy running around with a cartoonishly huge net
[1:22:27] <+anoldtoilet> LUL
[1:22:33] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> SHRIMP ON DA BARBAY
[1:22:38] <ingman112> @anoldtoilet If we followed that rule there would be no mods
[1:22:38] <dinnydanny777> Imagine if you found the cryptid and your paint killed it
[1:22:42] <+froduck42> "and they came boundin ovah"
[1:22:49] <%vaderxyz1970> Use Pestasides to find the Phasmid if all bugs are dead it should be only one left right?
[1:22:50] <+Tuffty> Maybe just appreciate that people watching Woolie play are also experiencing it for the first time too.
[1:22:53] <stardustcrusad3r> based kim dabbing on cryptoloonies
[1:22:54] <dukenux> @doomerskeletor13 "a tiny net is unbeatable"
[1:22:54] <mychael_bae> they might have painted a camouflaged bug
[1:22:55] <elshadow7> @krispen_wa Oh, perish the thought! I'm just saying it's silly to say it's Woolie's or the mod's fault
[1:23:03] <Blackleafx> YES
[1:23:05] <+anoldtoilet> no, you just trust woolie or minh or someone to pick someone who can do it and stop backseat modding
[1:23:06] <heysamuel> of course you do!
[1:23:13] <+illusiveSaint> there needs to be some public execution revolutionary style in the chat just to make a point LUL
[1:23:14] <+anoldtoilet> anyway i want to pay attention to this!
[1:23:15] <primaryfire> pursuing falsifiability is respectable
[1:23:17] <brisk_dacat> what else you gotta do
[1:23:18] <dinnydanny777> Is he being gnomes
[1:23:20] <heysamuel> it's only 8.30am, plenty of time to psychoanalyze this guy
[1:23:21] <+anoldtoilet> cryptids ftw!!!
[1:23:23] <drunken_lemur> Man!
[1:23:26] <%MightyDuckShoes> @wolfofsound it's a toggle. it can be flipped on and off midstream. people do it all the time
[1:23:27] <%doomerskeletor13> I used to be super into cryptids when I was a teen

[3:32:43] <%derap41> Post modern i guess
[3:32:45] <Ids560> the monarchist path is just folded into the fascist one
[3:32:46] <heemwizard> no thought there
[3:32:52] <elshadow7> I don't think that was a thought
[3:32:55] <elshadow7> Just some trivia
[3:32:57] <%hax_metatron> Just a deadend musing
[3:32:58] <Ecall10528> Over thinking it.

[5:06:41] <dewwy125> 1
[5:06:44] <heemwizard> dont mention 5
[5:06:46] <%Gruhunchously> Not 5
[5:06:46] <Miklosher> 4
[5:06:51] <iacus_> 4 is solid
[5:06:51] <a_bald_bro> 4 obviously
[5:06:56] <OfficerMods> I don't understand how this theory holds water, the gunshot would be audible from the roof
[5:07:12] <heemwizard> @OfficerMods yeah the game mentions it later
[5:07:32] <OfficerMods> but they are acting like it's even plausible
[5:07:38] <sirrice77> 2
[5:07:43] <dewwy125> maybe they didnt hear
[5:07:43] <ingman112> 1 and 2 both seem good
[5:07:51] <heemwizard> say 1 then move on with 6
[5:07:52] <meatman_noplan> 2 would fit really well if the guns are military
[5:07:54] <iacus_> you can move on
[5:08:10] <iacus_> you messed up

[5:08:37] <%Juriasu> oh my god I love this game
[5:08:41] <heemwizard> the game is very forgiving
[5:09:01] <dukenux> ONE more thing...
[5:09:02] <BurdRightsActivist> MUSHROOMED DEATHBRINGER
[5:09:05] <diddlerriddler> ok I'm just worried he's going to rush the main plot
[5:09:06] <kingra> Fat neutral...
[5:09:15] <heemwizard> say 1 and move on
[5:09:20] <dreamfillah> we good
[5:09:23] <%DiscoMatador> good
[5:09:26] <heemwizard> or not
[5:09:28] <codymagpie> 1 and 5
[5:09:28] <a_bald_bro> 1 seems kinda dumb
[5:09:30] <ingman112> @diddlerriddler Chat will let him know before he hits the point of no return
[5:09:35] <%Gruhunchously> @diddlerriddler Doesn't the game warn you when you're about to hit the point of no return?
[5:09:47] <a_bald_bro> aaand it was dumb
[5:10:02] <heemwizard> not entirely
[5:10:06] <zanzibarian_hamster> Any sentence starting with "all i'm saying", is asking for trouble
[5:10:08] <heemwizard> just not 3 and 5
[5:10:20] <%mariothemaio> @diddlerriddler it does
[5:10:29] <dreamfillah> so cool
[5:10:30] <zanzibarian_hamster> Nothing good comes from "all i'm saying"
[5:10:32] <%mariothemaio> warn at the point of no return that is
[5:10:50] <linSP> look man, I’m just saying those al-behds
[5:11:09] <heemwizard> yeah thats right
[5:11:37] <Johannen> 2 has some good Titus info
[5:11:39] <iacus_> wömen intüition
[5:12:03] <%SomeAsianDood> It's a shame they didn't embrace an Inexplicable Feminist Agenda
[5:12:06] <BurdRightsActivist> Dont think 2 has anything, you can just skip it 4Head
[5:12:09] <marcomatame> What's Alain's accent from? He sounds Spanish/Italian but very thick
[5:12:28] <heemwizard> @SomeAsianDood they were too far into the game for that
[5:12:29] <Dopamien> she has a good shit compressor
[5:12:30] <iacus_> Sounds close to spanish yes
[5:12:43] <Miklosher> 2 sounds good
[5:12:45] <%SomeAsianDood> @heemwizard i know the check is literally when the talk with Garte on the first day
[5:12:58] <heemwizard> yea was a hilarious check too
[5:13:08] <heemwizard> they would skip the cock carousel thing tho
[5:13:18] <heemwizard> if they had the thought
[5:13:22] <BurdRightsActivist> REALLY??
[5:13:27] <Reveresao> 2

[5:13:34] <codymagpie> lol
[5:13:52] <%Gruhunchously> @heemwizard Nope, it's still possible to Cock Carousel as a Feminist...it's just harder to fail the check

[5:14:21] <%wolfofsound> Titus is actually reasonable
[5:14:22] <Miklosher> 2 then move on?
[5:14:28] <Johannen> 2 is good
[5:14:32] <TheD3rp416> 2 could work
[5:14:42] <Johannen> Damn
[5:14:46] <meatman_noplan> daaaamn
[5:14:46] <marcomatame> Mañana is obviusly spanish as well, if you hear spanish-speaker talking in english they're more likely to sound like Mañana than Alain, so I wouldn't pin its accent being spanish so easy
[5:14:54] <+mechslayer71> leave dialogue on the table, rpg 101
[5:14:59] <%teefpal> *opinion
[5:15:09] <shincadad> Theo the realest

[5:26:52] <andre11dr> I don't get Reboot
[5:27:02] <andre11dr> I tried to watch it
[5:27:07] <andre11dr> It's kinda bad

[5:27:40] <marcomatame> Woolie wanna roleplay Sol in Disco Elysium

[5:29:14] <%Irridium> oh so me with games as a service
[5:29:21] <primaryfire> I kept myself from playing mafia 2 because I always heard it ends on a cliffhanger
[5:29:21] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[5:29:31] <vonmaultke> punitive FOMO LUL It hurts you for failing
[5:29:38] <dreamfillah> lowkey
[5:29:41] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Want to know what you missed under the 2 with that Ruby talk?
[5:29:42] <+ReallyBigRocks> only 1000 episodes
[5:29:44] <Jolly_Adventurer> You can but you miss on hype moments
[5:29:44] <%vaderxyz1970> Getting the S20 when the S21 is anouced next day :(
[5:29:46] <%wolfofsound> OP is gonna have an ending unlike berserk PepeHands
[5:29:48] <%DashXero> Reggie, you're missing out on one of the best stories. Period.
[5:29:51] <%thedankestmeeme> ONE PIECE IS DOPE AS F
[5:29:51] <dukenux> lemme just catch up with 900 episodes
[5:29:52] <+ReallyBigRocks> bang it out in a week or two
[5:29:53] <lotharrio> You could like... watch some of the movies, I guess? Would give you an idea of how it goes.
[5:29:54] <+Meathands> "Yeah I bet it is. a THOUSAND fuckin' episodes though?"
[5:30:00] <Iandrasil> it's a great journey
[5:30:08] <dreamfillah> One Piece is super worth it
[5:30:10] <Prevot> I'd say don't get into Berserk until... recently. Now at least you KNOW for sure there will be no end
[5:30:14] <andre11dr> Well Disco Elysium is nothing but FOMO every second
[5:30:17] <Iandrasil> one piece is probably the best written shounen manga
[5:30:19] <%DashXero> One Piece hasn't tripped up yet.
[5:30:19] <primaryfire> visible seams
[5:30:20] <dreamfillah> Oh yeah, youll spot the patterns but
[5:30:21] <%thedankestmeeme> I caught up in 3-4 months ez clap all day one piece
[5:30:22] <%wolfofsound> True
[5:30:27] <andre11dr> Yep
[5:30:29] <the_angelon_experience> the manga is cool but the anime got good only at Wano
[5:30:30] <%wolfofsound> You don't read it for the formula tho
[5:30:32] <%jinking79> there some fights in ippo i want to see animated
[5:30:41] <Ziegsy> If I cant platinum a game it puts me off playing
[5:30:41] <lotharrio> 1000 episodes. ~18 minutes an episode or ~7 minutes a chapter. Realistically you could get through it in about... three months at a reasonable pace.
[5:30:45] <dreamfillah> But fact is One Piece maintains a quality between decent to GREAT throughout
[5:30:46] <Iandrasil> the anime is a thorough meh, one pace is better fixes the awful pacing
[5:30:48] <%thedankestmeeme> BRO I love the music in the background sounds clean
[5:30:52] <andre11dr> Actually it turns out to be worth it
[5:31:01] <iacus_> what is 1000 episodes? I missed the start of the convo
[5:31:02] <%teefpal> Any long running thing gets super exhausting for me
[5:31:05] <dreamfillah> U WIN
[5:31:07] <%Tearonex> I bet Luffy is going to punch the badguy and win LUL
[5:31:13] <%wolfofsound> I chose wisely
[5:31:14] <nelsonsaysbooya> The nice thing about long series is you can drink greedily until you are caught up
[5:31:18] <codymagpie> cdi zelda: I won
[5:31:24] <andre11dr> It just that it has world building only rivalled by Tolkien
[5:31:26] <Prevot> I chose all three and dropped Naruto and Bleach long before they ended
[5:31:28] <%wolfofsound> yeah that'll end Kappa
[5:31:30] <%teefpal> The Trails series is another good example of a long-running series that is just SO LONG
[5:31:32] <%DashXero> Watching someone fresh get into One Piece is the greatest feeling on the internet.
[5:31:34] <%krispen_wa> WHENS GON IN A MINUTE WOOLIE?!
[5:31:35] <dreamfillah> What was that
[5:31:40] <%Irridium> Gintama the true king
[5:31:41] <iacus_> Oh One Piece
[5:31:41] <%thedankestmeeme> bingeing one piece felt so gud
[5:31:55] <%jinking79> no one reads Bourto
[5:32:00] <dreamfillah> Mihawk
[5:32:02] <Prevot> honestly getting into HxH is a way worse deal cause that shit will never get an ending
[5:32:11] <iacus_> I keep hearing One Piece is good but, man it's so off-puttingly ugly that I can't bring myself to watch it
[5:32:13] <andre11dr> One Piece has some cool stuff
[5:32:16] <%teefpal> Garwsh
[5:32:21] <codymagpie> maybe goofy is cool :(
[5:32:21] <%krispen_wa> get into hxh and just think the anime ending is the real ending
[5:32:21] <%DashXero> The goofy loops around to become cool.
[5:32:22] <andre11dr> Woolie would love Kaido
[5:32:25] <Jolly_Adventurer> One Piece is like 70% goofy shit
[5:32:25] <%thedankestmeeme> ZORO Is the most serious guy tho unironically
[5:32:29] <Prevot> motherfucker you used to watch wrestling
[5:32:32] <Johannen> I feel the same kind of energy from Devil May Cry, goofy can be Cool
[5:32:35] <dreamfillah> @iacus_ it's brimming with personality and creativitu tho
[5:32:35] <Jolly_Adventurer> And we love it for it
[5:32:36] <meatman_noplan> Kaido's design is pretty cool.
[5:32:43] <dreamfillah> GO
[5:32:44] <%thedankestmeeme> kaido is sick
[5:32:47] <dreamfillah> KAIDOOOOOOOO
[5:32:57] <OblivionSword1> look him up woolie
[5:32:58] <%thedankestmeeme> HE TRANSFORMS TO A DRAGON
[5:32:58] <%Lion_kun> WHO WAS IT?
[5:33:06] <lotharrio> If Dante put a sword in his mouth so he could triple wield, you'd fucking love it.
[5:33:09] <%Lion_kun> He has multiple forms.
[5:33:14] <%Lion_kun> He's a dragon.
[5:33:15] <%thedankestmeeme> See a vid where he transforms
[5:33:16] <+xXfuzzball64Xx> naw he so cool doe
[5:33:16] <dreamfillah> wo ro ro ro
[5:33:18] <Johannen> White Beard is the winner
[5:33:20] <+timtomkitkat> They all goof troop
[5:33:23] <andre11dr> I would bet
[5:33:23] <StarlitStunner> Bad take
[5:33:29] <+xXfuzzball64Xx> HYBRID FORM
[5:33:31] <Ziegsy> @lotharrio you say that like dante isnt fucking goofy
[5:33:36] <%krispen_wa> his head is so much smaller than his body
[5:33:37] <%Lion_kun> It's cooler when you read it.
[5:33:37] <dukenux> "Oh cool, Charizard"
[5:33:37] <%thedankestmeeme> big mom is super goofy
[5:33:42] <lotharrio> I'm saying that he's the same type of goofy.
[5:33:58] <dreamfillah> oh THAT'S A BAD PICTURE
[5:33:59] <meatman_noplan> Yeah, fair point.
[5:34:00] <+Sajallday> I think the problem with one piece is its more cooler in context than out of context
[5:34:02] <Johannen> Quick....who is the stronk female pirate in One piece?
[5:34:03] <linSP> goof good
[5:34:09] <+xXfuzzball64Xx> SHANKS
[5:34:11] <Johannen> Preferably old with short hair
[5:34:14] <+Sajallday> Big Mom
[5:34:16] <andre11dr> Well if you don't care about the art style it's fine, i think it unique
[5:34:17] <dreamfillah> Big Mom @johannen

[5:34:21] <BlackermanZX> katakuri or shanks yeah
