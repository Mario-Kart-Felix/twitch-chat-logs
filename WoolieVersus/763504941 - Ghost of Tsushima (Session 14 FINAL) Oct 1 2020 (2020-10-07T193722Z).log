[0:16:23] <danknugglit> I thought you stopped getting points after all the skills
[0:16:23] <%Josef_Stryker> They should've made it like Spider-Man where getting additional points just gives u minor increases to health
[0:16:46] <Lynxystem> thats odd, i platinumed the game and only had as many skill points as i could use
[0:16:50] <%doomerskeletor13> @josef_stryker You can keep doing New Game plus and leveling up and get your character ridiculously OP
[0:16:51] <+Arkfyre> Does the deluxe version of the game give you extra points? Because I'm pretty sure the base game gives you exactly enough to buy everything.
[0:16:58] <yusefHD> and that's why they didn't give you a trophy for it LUL
[0:17:00] <%mikesapartment> its a digital deluxe point

[1:04:42] <+zanzibar_junker> he is that why the sengoku era happened

[1:17:30] <%Exiliator> woolieGASM woolieGASM woolieGASM
[1:17:31] <+xXRealGamerThaigeXx> other ending is better imo
[1:17:32] <sonofthedeepsouth> NICE
[1:17:33] <SteelSnake93101> Clap
[1:17:34] <tonfirean> The problem with watching Woolie stream games I played is that Woolie and I always make the same decisions, so I don't get to see new stuff.
[1:17:34] <T_Sasquatch> @lion_kun even the director of the game says spare is the real answer
[1:17:35] <$BallerSwagBro9k> BRAVO SP
[1:17:36] <andrewofbob> Left trigger is Paragom
[1:17:38] <+solzan2000> Clap
[1:17:39] <trianglehat> Clap
[1:17:40] <42nfl19> Does Woolie understand why there is a save now?
[1:17:40] <@Menitta> wow
[1:17:41] <sonofthedeepsouth> CLAP IT
[1:17:41] <SomersaultJustice> now what
[1:17:41] <%Lion_kun> The spare ending is better.
[1:17:42] <%Shardlab> Why be a Slave to his honor?
[1:17:46] <%doomerskeletor13> I knew exactly what ending Woolie would pick
[1:17:47] <T_Sasquatch> FUCK HONOR
[1:17:49] <%johnny_gogo> HONOR SUCKS
[1:17:53] <+AsinPersuasion> FUCK I MISSED IT
[1:17:53] <+solzan2000> one of the best openworlds have played
[1:17:54] <%cobalt_phoenix_> I HATE HONOR
[1:17:54] <Lynxystem> man i prefer the other ending but that one is still SUPER STRONG
[1:17:55] <%Shardlab> Let him live in shame
[1:17:56] <+agent_raiken> Chose to kill AND you arent crying!?!? you monster!
[1:17:56] <Halospaz117> GOD I LOVE THIS GAME
[1:17:57] <+AsinPersuasion> honor or kill?
[1:18:01] <+JingKaisean> oh shit, a slave to honor
[1:18:01] <SomersaultJustice> all my homies hate honor
[1:18:01] <RamenRiderZ> Let him die now vs drag his pride through the mud until shogun forces you to seppuku for failing to kill the ghost
[1:18:01] <penitentpentwitch> Now to wait for the DLC
[1:18:02] <+AsinPersuasion> err honor or walk away?
[1:18:09] <armchairmaster_> After all the game of dishonor, YOU CHOSE HONOR AT THE FUCKING END?
[1:18:12] <%Livelinne> lytGGS
[1:18:14] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Legit one of the strongest endings ive seen
[1:18:21] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Right up there with MGS3
[1:18:23] <%doomerskeletor13> Very, very strong ending
[1:18:29] <danknugglit> not yet
[1:18:29] <%Shardlab> To hell with his honor. Live on as a ghost
[1:18:39] <T_Sasquatch> In the end jin would never kill his dad
[1:18:40] <+rottingpastry> Don't. Watch a video of it after a day or two.
[1:18:41] <%Exiliator> We fight with dishonor when we have to, so that we may fight with honor when we can.
[1:18:59] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Agree
[1:19:01] <%mikesapartment> fair enough
[1:19:01] <+Arkfyre> Woolie is right
[1:19:03] <T_Sasquatch> Nah fuck that. Eat shit old man
[1:19:03] <armchairmaster_> @exiliator cept one leads to a dead uncle, and the other doesnt
[1:19:06] <%sjay449> Woolie is right
[1:19:10] <CoffeeShopA> Absolutely
[1:19:12] <Halospaz117> Yeah this is pretty spot on
[1:19:13] <%doomerskeletor13> I agree with that rationale
[1:19:13] <%CptnCampy61> Yup. I had the same feeling
[1:19:16] <%Livelinne> Ye...
[1:19:20] <T_Sasquatch> How dare you try to kill your own adoptive son
[1:19:29] <%Lion_kun> Nah, he should walk away to show how he is above Honor
[1:19:29] <%Shardlab> Yes, Jin would just go
[1:19:35] <Xenthinel> But the whole story is about screw honor though
[1:19:38] <+zanzibar_junker> he wants to die though
[1:19:44] <KngMatthias> VoteYea
[1:19:52] <%mikesapartment> Woolie is a good son
[1:19:58] <+jiggy_snipe> yea I agree Woolie
[1:20:00] <+rottingpastry> he's a shitlord, fuck what he wants.
[1:20:01] <T_Sasquatch> Let him eat his path LUL
[1:20:01] <%Livelinne> Feudalism, man...
[1:20:02] <%doomerskeletor13> He still respects his Uncle Dad though, I think he would let him have his last request
[1:20:11] <%Prevot> he's old and old people don't change, they just die
[1:20:11] <+jiggy_snipe> BIG DISHONOR
[1:20:14] <tonfirean> The whole game you've been resisting him pushing his value system on you. You walking away would be you pushing your value system on him.
[1:20:15] <%Exiliator> @armchairmaster_ sure, but it leaves an alive uncle, that wants to die
[1:20:19] <%Mr_Strut> As a wise man once said, the greatest suffering you can inflict is to let him continue to live his unfortunate life
[1:20:20] <%Lion_kun> Jin is a Ghost. He no longer has to satisfy the outdated concepts of honor
[1:20:22] <Frostydough1> might as well spit on his face when waling away
[1:20:27] <$BallerSwagBro9k> This game or Cyberpunk will win GOTY
[1:20:28] <%johnny_gogo> kill is deff the cannon for me
[1:20:28] <%Shardlab> It's individualistic and knowing he can't go back
[1:20:34] <+zanzibar_junker> I prefer walking away
[1:20:38] <RamenRiderZ> Sparing him will be a slow death for him. Shimura wouldve prob be forced to seppuku for failing to kill the ghost. So either die a warriors death or live in shame then die
[1:20:42] <T_Sasquatch> @tonfirean .... Ok. .. His value system is idiotic
[1:20:43] <Lynxystem> you are ACTUALLY letting him live tho, the wounds arent fatal
[1:20:46] <Halospaz117> I don't think there is a wrong ending here personally, both work really good
[1:20:52] <+jiggy_snipe> @tonfirean yea that's an important point, Jin would just be Shimura if he did that
[1:20:54] <%doomerskeletor13> From the end of Act 2 onward the narrative of this game became really, really strong
[1:21:00] <%Shardlab> He threw being a samurai away when he let it go already
[1:21:02] <%CptnCampy61> Also the shogun might’ve had him killed if you didn’t. Sparing him more shame
[1:21:04] <Nobuwaroo> both endings can be interpreted in a number of ways
[1:21:04] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @RamenRiderZ Exactly he was definitely screwed either way
[1:21:07] <T_Sasquatch> @halospaz117 dude the director says so LUL
[1:21:11] <armchairmaster_> Ishikawa: "Don't become like me, Jin." Woolie: *becomes even worse than Ishikawa did in his own side quest.
[1:21:15] <%Lion_kun> Or he can live to realize Jin is right. Honor is stupid.
[1:21:19] <%BinaryFireball> ah shit I missed it
[1:21:25] <Halospaz117> @T_Sasquatch ?
[1:21:29] <%Shardlab> Honor is incredibly stupid
[1:21:38] <penitentpentwitch> And then he teleports away in midbattle
[1:21:38] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:21:46] <%doomerskeletor13> I like the bait and switch there
[1:21:48] <%johnny_gogo> a story that start surpassingly weak and end surprisingly strong
[1:21:48] <tonfirean> Eh, the game vindicates "but my honor though" somewhat when the Khan starts poisoning people.
[1:21:52] <+TheNeonGraveyard> Kick Khotun's fucking ass
[1:21:52] <T_Sasquatch> @halospaz117 in an interviewe the director of the game says spare is the right answer
[1:21:55] <%Exiliator> Honor is good sometimes
[1:22:07] <+duskrush> It's nice that Smash has someone to combat all those creepers
[1:22:13] <Shwepie> The story isn't about screw honor, it's about finding out what honor means to you and living up to it. To Jin, honor meant fighting for people who could not, even if it meant going against the code he was raised in.
[1:22:16] <Halospaz117> Hm, even though I prefer spare I disagree calling either one "correct"
[1:22:25] <%sjay449> Round 2 is Worldstar
[1:22:27] <sonofthedeepsouth> PLAY TO WIN
[1:22:28] <%doomerskeletor13> Final options should’ve been Dosho or no Dosho
[1:22:32] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Cant believe Steve is in LUL THE MEMES
[1:22:39] <+J3HT> i prefer the batman ending
[1:22:52] <JdotSweapA> mm
[1:22:55] <yusefHD> Dosho Picante is on point
[1:23:07] <+rottingpastry> Nacho cheese dosho
[1:23:09] <%Livelinne> psaBig feelies
[1:23:12] <+Ryaotz> All for that last one
[1:23:13] <Halospaz117> "I trained my poetry skills to kill my uncle"
[1:23:16] <T_Sasquatch> @halospaz117 just look up the interview he did with kindafunny on YouTube . It's quite clear
[1:23:16] <$BallerSwagBro9k> i havent seen an ending so strong since Witcher 3 middle ending
[1:23:30] <%doomerskeletor13> That finale felt like the perfect culmination of the game. They should be very proud of that ending
[1:23:32] <Halospaz117> @T_Sasquatch I'm not saying he didn't say that, I just disagree with him
[1:23:33] <T_Sasquatch> Good gayme !
[1:24:07] <%Prevot> now I'm glad Ubisoft never made japan AC cause it would never be half as good as this
[1:24:08] <T_Sasquatch> Goty contender for sure
[1:24:22] <%doomerskeletor13> The games narrative didn’t really coalesce until the last third of the game, but when it did it worked so well
[1:24:23] <Halospaz117> I still gotta do my replay in Kurosawa mode
[1:24:27] <+TheNeonGraveyard> Lookin forward to that legends dlc
[1:24:34] <+duskrush> !time
[1:24:44] <+solzan2000> its out of GOT and TLOU2 for GOTY
[1:24:44] <%Exiliator> Oh look Taiwan Kappa
[1:25:00] <%doomerskeletor13> T*iwan
[1:25:02] <Halospaz117> Yuna ended up being my favorite I think
[1:25:10] <%johnny_gogo> shitty people do
[1:25:15] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Taywaion? Whats that?
[1:25:16] <+rottingpastry> got has a well-paced and plotted story
[1:25:17] <+agent_raiken> no forced romance either
[1:25:24] <tonfirean> People are just chemicals
[1:25:24] <+Ryaotz> This year might suck but we got some good games
[1:25:29] <%Livelinne> Yuna is the best shiaLove
[1:25:31] <misterurbanthelegend> Storm Shadow!
[1:25:32] <+TheNeonGraveyard> Still kinda mad at uncle for trying to throw Yuna under the bus
[1:25:35] <AThing_> we did get some damn fine games this year
[1:25:35] <%doomerskeletor13> She kind of reminded me of Bonnie McFarlane from RDR a little
[1:25:36] <Halospaz117> YEAH BEST LOOK
[1:25:39] <+rottingpastry> tlou2 has story...wait we need a flashback...wait we need a flashback in the flashback
[1:25:40] <%johnny_gogo> @agent_raiken i agree no force romance was a good call
[1:25:42] <T_Sasquatch> Whiteeeee
[1:25:49] <+rottingpastry> If you want to see what he says about stuff, do it all now
[1:25:54] <sonofthedeepsouth> nice shaq
[1:25:55] <danknugglit> Edgy ending
[1:25:58] <Halospaz117> Man I prefer spare but this armor color is SO MUCH BETTER
[1:26:02] <+rottingpastry> It disappears
[1:26:05] <jorniev> LOOK TAT GHOST

[1:26:12] <armchairmaster_> $500 dollars that Masako fucking dunks on Jin if he decides to kill his Uncle.
[1:26:13] <%johnny_gogo> bat cave
[1:26:17] <+sjay449> hobo lair
[1:26:22] <+rottingpastry> It's near a hot spring I forget which one

[1:28:18] <DXLelouch24> You owe your horse a visit to his grave Woolie
[1:28:25] <danknugglit> you passed by this hut a couple stream back
[1:28:26] <+Dhamilt> Still, that doesnt make the pain go away
[1:28:34] <+rottingpastry> nope, something different for each banner
[1:28:35] <T_Sasquatch> I really thought they wouldn't kill your horse if you had a djgital deluxe one LUL
[1:28:47] <sonofthedeepsouth> you must fuck to make more sakais jin

[1:28:58] <$BallerSwagBro9k> THE SAKAI BLOODLINE
[1:29:01] <penitentpentwitch> Need that billowing cape
[1:29:04] <$BallerSwagBro9k> MUST CONTINUE
[1:29:10] <armchairmaster_> "I won't let my family fade from memory, but I will murder them."
[1:29:25] <penitentpentwitch> "Press X to continue bloodline."
[1:29:39] <+rottingpastry> there's some dumb origami on the table
[1:29:40] <%Livelinne> Butt time?
[1:29:41] <sonofthedeepsouth> kill the shogun?
[1:29:57] <T_Sasquatch> I kinda dont want a ghost of tsushima 2
[1:30:00] <$BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[1:30:05] <Pappajimbo> Ghost 2 kill the shogan
[1:30:11] <%Proxzo> RIP DLC Deluxe Horse
[1:30:14] <%Livelinne> woolieSHOOK
[1:30:23] <+rottingpastry> I'd expect "ghost of X" instead of ghost of tsushima 2
[1:30:30] <+rottingpastry> if anything
[1:30:41] <%doomerskeletor13> If they did a new game I’d expect a new protagonist
[1:30:45] <armchairmaster_> @rottingpastry Ghost of Machu Pichu
[1:30:51] <sonofthedeepsouth> JUST FUCK GODDAMN IT
[1:30:53] <+Sliverits> Does she say something different if you've liberated everywhere?
[1:30:59] <jorniev> JIN SOUNDS DEPRESSED
[1:31:06] <CoffeeShopA> @rottingpastry Ghost of the Steppes
[1:31:09] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @doomerskeletor13 Yeah like I said earlier the Nobunaga era woild be rad
[1:31:14] <+TheNeonGraveyard> Until is is done
[1:31:26] <T_Sasquatch> You get a different house location and house name
[1:31:34] <%doomerskeletor13> I think they should do a game based on the Black Samurai Yosuke
[1:31:38] <RamenRiderZ> Id love the ghost 2 twisted like you are the one trying to hold onto the honor
[1:31:45] <%doomerskeletor13> That would be really interesting
[1:31:46] <sonofthedeepsouth> Hey I saved your ass
[1:31:49] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @doomerskeletor13 Oh yeah thats good too
[1:31:52] <jorniev> this is the khans head
[1:31:52] <%Mr_Strut> Maybe there's a merit here?
[1:31:53] <sonofthedeepsouth> NAH BRUH
[1:32:09] <%Livelinne> shiaBuns shiaBuns shiaBuns
[1:32:10] <Chatterbox1991> BUT HONOR WOOLIE
[1:32:11] <%doomerskeletor13> @ballerswagbro9k Yosuke existed in the Nobunga era so it would work both ways
[1:32:16] <penitentpentwitch> "We're too deep in the honor Research Tree to look away."
[1:32:18] <%Exiliator> Time for Jin to go and become a goofy anime co-protagonist that always cracks jokes, that no one thinks twice about, that they will after some time, find out is actually a badass legend thats killed hundreds.
[1:32:22] <KngMatthias> FACTS Woolz VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea
[1:32:23] <+TheNeonGraveyard> The shogun is definitely already looking into training shinobi

[1:32:36] <%Lion_kun> Do spare ending first.

[1:35:15] <%cobalt_phoenix_> sorry caps
[1:35:24] <PassTheTurkeyLeg> Woolie, thoughts on the Green Bay Packers for smash?
[1:35:25] <kenny_biff> @Double_Tap_That its just that a lot of fans (like me) have been wanting a real new game plus since it came out. but him saying post game makes sense
[1:35:28] <armchairmaster_> "I know what you did last playthrough Jin bugifBeam "
[1:35:30] <DSD24> @cobalt_phoenix_ Ok cool! I
[1:35:33] <Lynxystem> godDAMN this theme is so fucking strong

[1:36:35] <42nfl19> Let him live. IDK why people says you let him suffer to death
[1:36:36] <danknugglit> Best line
[1:36:40] <armchairmaster_> Best End
[1:36:44] <%Exiliator> Not for honor, but for youuuuuu
[1:36:47] <%Shardlab> Your honor makes you predictable
[1:36:48] <$BallerSwagBro9k> I want Sunhilegend to make Ultrakill gifs
[1:36:51] <%brambling13> Killing uncle is easily my fave ending it’s much cooler and I thinks fitting that it’s Jin’s final act of honour. like it dies with uncle. It hits harder
[1:37:07] <%Mr_Strut> Endless mode
[1:37:08] <+StrawberryPantsu> Spare is the better ending....

[1:37:38] <+jiggy_snipe> this is the shogunate, he would have to commit seppuku for failing to kill the shogun and not killing the ghost

[1:38:03] <%doomerskeletor13> Uncle malding lmao
[1:38:04] <+StrawberryPantsu> Spare>Kill
[1:38:05] <%brambling13> Idk spare kinda bummed me out but in a bad way lol
[1:38:06] <armchairmaster_> Much BETTER
[1:38:07] <+rottingpastry> Naw
[1:38:09] <%CptnCampy61> It’s Not a phase Dad!!!
[1:38:09] <+Aldesso> this ending weak as FUUUUUUUCK
[1:38:11] <quipquest1> "Damn, my nephew's a weeaboo."
[1:38:11] <AThing_> uncle just gets seppuku'd in this ending
[1:38:12] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Nah other ending FOR SURE
[1:38:13] <%SilverDevilfish> no way to skip cutscenes like it's 2004 Kappa
[1:38:14] <jorniev> your uncle calls you a weeb on this ending
[1:38:17] <%Lion_kun> Do a poll woolie
[1:38:23] <DSD24> I like both endings but I prefer the Kill ending
[1:38:23] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @T_Sasquatch
[1:38:24] <%doomerskeletor13> I agree with Woolz
[1:38:24] <KngMatthias> The Caucasity of Uncle VoteNay
[1:38:24] <%cobalt_phoenix_> monkaS
[1:38:26] <+solzan2000> lol
[1:38:27] <danknugglit> The weather says this is the good ending
[1:38:27] <penitentpentwitch> "No! Come back and kill me! I don't want to have to have another kid!"
[1:38:29] <sendart> oh great he gets to commit seppuku now
[1:38:30] <GandhiTheTerrible> Spare fits Jin, but Kill is more dramatic I guess
[1:38:34] <+jiggy_snipe> did you the kill the ghost? no well die then
[1:38:35] <$BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[1:38:40] <%Shardlab> Fuck yo' honor
[1:38:41] <Lynxystem> the japanese dub doesnt have NEARLY the emphasis on the line "you are a SLAVE to your honor" that the english does, i felt the spare ending was the way to go
[1:38:41] <T_Sasquatch> Didn't see him. , he ran away. Just lie
[1:38:44] <%Livelinne> woolieMIRIN
[1:38:50] <Halospaz117> "Well if you alive that dirty ghost must surely be dead now, right?" *LOUD SWEATING*
[1:38:51] <armchairmaster_> "Yo shogun I just got fucking ROCKED, he's your problem."
[1:38:58] <%Lion_kun> Fuck honor.
[1:39:03] <DSD24> Woolie should watch the endings in English!
[1:39:05] <AThing_> "sorry shogun he was really strong and dishonorable"
[1:39:08] <+StrawberryPantsu> FUCK HONOR
[1:39:08] <T_Sasquatch> Fuck his path LUL
[1:39:09] <yusefHD> this song gives me some freaking chills man
[1:39:15] <+TheNeonGraveyard> Yo fuck honor, all my homies hate honor
[1:39:18] <%CptnCampy61> Lord Shimura alive in next game. Pretty sure that’ll be the canon
[1:39:19] <%Shardlab> Pretty much
[1:39:20] <%brambling13> Kill uncle wooliePOYO
[1:39:24] <armchairmaster_> You can go down different paths without murdering each other.
[1:39:26] <%Exiliator> You sent me to 1v1 the ghost of tsushima? You think I was gonna win?
[1:39:30] <sonofthedeepsouth> HONOR GETS YOU BTFO
[1:39:33] <%Josef_Stryker> Fight FOR Honor not WITH Honor.
[1:39:33] <%doomerskeletor13> Imo I think Jin still loves his Uncle enough to grant his last request
[1:39:34] <%Shardlab> Throw your honor in the ocean
[1:39:36] <T_Sasquatch> Honestly I would like woolie to hear it in english
[1:39:36] <%Lion_kun> Do a poll woolie.
[1:39:41] <ChungusQuest> Lieutenant Worf taught me that honor always gets bodied.
[1:39:41] <42nfl19> Honor gets your island taken over
[1:39:42] <misterurbanthelegend> When your a racist dad and your son walks away dressed like a wiggah!
[1:39:46] <armchairmaster_> Poll times
[1:39:48] <sonofthedeepsouth> LOGH teached me all that I have to know about honor
[1:39:49] <penitentpentwitch> Shogun: "You have failed me, your punishment? You must continue your bloodline!" Uncle: "Noooooo!"
[1:39:55] <DSD24> @doomerskeletor13 That's what I feel too
[1:40:03] <%johnny_gogo> Killing is cool
[1:40:05] <%paladinstarbuster> wha happen
[1:40:06] <sonofthedeepsouth> Please Shogun i don't want to fuck
[1:40:08] <GandhiTheTerrible> you can skip with X now
[1:40:08] <%Livelinne> LUL
[1:40:10] <OldManDeckardCain> do a raffle instead LUL
[1:40:10] <+StrawberryPantsu> Your justification is wrong
[1:40:17] <danknugglit> Happy clear weather = good end Kappa
[1:40:19] <%afronooch> !raffle
[1:40:20] <Halospaz117> I think Kill is a stronger ending, but Spare fit's Jin's characterization more
[1:40:20] <armchairmaster_> @strawberrypantsu lmao
[1:40:22] <+duskrush> Ghost of 2Shima
[1:40:24] <%Livelinne> Way to go Woolz woolieGLORY

[1:40:30] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @42nfl19
[1:40:30] <+rottingpastry> look at the origami
[1:40:32] <Idon__> he's rocking a sick red now
[1:40:33] <DSD24> Ooo cool Red
[1:40:33] <T_Sasquatch> Your opinions are wrong and I hopr you stub your toe !
[1:40:34] <%Josef_Stryker> Ooh red outfit
[1:40:35] <penitentpentwitch> So what changes in the house?
[1:40:41] <%Lion_kun> The game thinks youre wrong woolie lol
[1:40:41] <%Livelinne> Oh lovely
[1:40:42] <T_Sasquatch> LUL
[1:40:44] <armchairmaster_> Look at that red style, you become DANTE HERE
[1:40:45] <%doomerskeletor13> LUL
[1:40:48] <+TheNeonGraveyard> The red and white dyes are both so fresh
[1:40:51] <42nfl19> Look at all this GOOD weather which is not BAD
[1:40:52] <T_Sasquatch> Hmmm i wonder whyyyy
[1:40:55] <danknugglit> Hes no edgy
[1:40:57] <yusefHD> ghost of Clan Sakai
[1:40:58] <%Exiliator> We know what you feel, but its interesting to see how big the split is in the community
[1:41:00] <sonofthedeepsouth> masako got rocked
[1:41:01] <danknugglit> Not
[1:41:01] <misterurbanthelegend> earth village shinobi.
[1:41:01] <%Proxzo> when did woolie fold that car?
[1:41:01] <GandhiTheTerrible> the examine dialouge is same
[1:41:02] <T_Sasquatch> Red sucks tho
[1:41:02] <%doomerskeletor13> That red armor is fresh tho
[1:41:03] <Lynxystem> the convo with Yuna is slightly different
[1:41:03] <DSD24> I like the White Armor more but this is nice too
[1:41:03] <+rottingpastry> he says a different thing about Shimura's armor I think?
[1:41:05] <penitentpentwitch> The armor would theoretically have different words?
[1:41:07] <armchairmaster_> Look at the uncle's armor
[1:41:11] <+rottingpastry> Same place
[1:41:16] <%Shardlab> Your entire justification is "Kinslayer hits you in the feels harder, tho...."
[1:41:21] <danknugglit> Same hut
[1:41:23] <+steelmorrigan> Same spot, different weather
[1:41:23] <%cobalt_phoenix_> new spot
[1:41:25] <+Dhamilt> Chill out sasquatch. Everyone can come to their own conclusions
[1:41:27] <%cobalt_phoenix_> wait nvm
[1:41:42] <T_Sasquatch> @dhamilt that was clearly a joke
[1:41:42] <DSD24> Both endings can work in context of the story
[1:41:50] <+Dhamilt> uh huh
[1:41:52] <sonofthedeepsouth> armopr
[1:41:55] <sonofthedeepsouth> UNCLE ARMOR
[1:41:56] <%doomerskeletor13> Ye same spot, different aesthetic
[1:42:02] <%Exiliator> white armor is definetly cooler
[1:42:03] <armchairmaster_> The ARMOR WOOLIE
[1:42:03] <+TheNeonGraveyard> No hotspring, bad ending
[1:42:04] <%Livelinne> Taka clempsSad
[1:42:11] <T_Sasquatch> @dhamilt i said i hope he stubs his toe dude LUL
[1:42:18] <sonofthedeepsouth> wait
[1:42:20] <penitentpentwitch> Weirdly the same?
[1:42:21] <sonofthedeepsouth> thats it
[1:42:24] <+rottingpastry> I wish you were here vs I hope you find peace
[1:42:31] <%cobalt_phoenix_> a little different
[1:42:32] <Halospaz117> "I hope you find peace uncle" POUNDS CHEST
[1:42:35] <DSD24> Is Uncle still alive in this path?
[1:42:37] <@SoushinSen> @doomerskeletor13 actually, it's a different location, but they copy-pasted the house
[1:42:38] <42nfl19> yes
[1:42:38] <+jiggy_snipe> your uncle is dead bro, the shogun killed him
[1:42:42] <armchairmaster_> @dsd24 yes
[1:42:43] <%Lion_kun> Hey guys did pat pick the spare ending
[1:42:50] <%Livelinne> Uncle’s prob fiiiine shiaDingus
[1:42:52] <%CptnCampy61> That’s a good point why would you have his armor if he’s alive?
[1:42:52] <%doomerskeletor13> @soushinsen Oh really? Odd. But cool
[1:42:52] <armchairmaster_> @jiggy_snipe stop lying
[1:42:53] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1310937719246385153?s=19
[1:43:07] <T_Sasquatch> I don't remember if pat finished it tbh
[1:43:15] <%Lion_kun> Because if he did next podcast is gonna be fire.
[1:43:16] <Halospaz117> I think pat stopped streaming it
[1:43:22] <%paladinstarbuster> i just got here. what happened is the ending of the game controversal?
[1:43:25] <danknugglit> The red oni straw hat looks sick with this dye
[1:43:31] <%afronooch> shogun would absolutely have shimura commit seppuku
[1:43:32] <%doomerskeletor13> I don’t think Patrick finished it
[1:43:40] <+jiggy_snipe> @armchairmaster_ lol obviously he's not dead yet but come one the Shogun is hardass who hates failures
[1:43:44] <T_Sasquatch> @paladinstarbuster nah just opinons and feelings
[1:43:46] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @paladinstarbuster people are split on which ending is right or wrong
[1:43:47] <42nfl19> Man even the weather is happy in this ending
[1:43:49] <%mikesapartment> Fuck the code!
[1:43:50] <AThing_> @paladinstarbuster not really, people are just arguing
[1:43:51] <DSD24> @paladinstarbuster From what I have seen both endings are people that like them
[1:43:52] <armchairmaster_> @paladinstarbuster you either become an uncle killer or you don't, so it's divisive
[1:44:00] <%doomerskeletor13> @paladinstarbuster There’s two options and people have strong feelings about which one is right
[1:44:03] <GandhiTheTerrible> nah, you're good
[1:44:06] <armchairmaster_> The giant Buddha looks over you with a smile in this ending
[1:44:12] <+TheNeonGraveyard> Same ending
[1:44:13] <sendart> nothing
[1:44:15] <@SoushinSen> same ending, wouldn' change a thing
[1:44:16] <%paladinstarbuster> Okay i see thanks
[1:44:17] <Halospaz117> Not too much
[1:44:17] <T_Sasquatch> It's a good choice . Like writing wise there's a good argument for each ending
[1:44:21] <%doomerskeletor13> No change!
[1:44:23] <+steelmorrigan> Same endigns, nothign special
[1:44:25] <misterurbanthelegend> no
[1:44:26] <+rottingpastry> You get a message if you do literally everything, but it's not worth it
[1:44:26] <+jiggy_snipe> would Yuna say something different?
[1:44:28] <Lynxystem> i cleared everything before finsihing the game, no difference,
[1:44:29] <fritz_dacat> So when do we fight the spirts as Legends?
[1:44:33] <GandhiTheTerrible> LUL
[1:44:35] <penitentpentwitch> Probably a postgame bit of dialogue, but ending doesn't likely change
[1:44:37] <+karldeck> Nope
[1:44:37] <%paladinstarbuster> YEAH YUNA IS WAIFU
[1:44:42] <%mikesapartment> you've defeated the mongols, now defeat my loins
[1:44:42] <Halospaz117> Kill the mongols so hard Yuna proposes on the spot
[1:44:46] <%Livelinne> woolieMIRIN woolieMIRIN woolieMIRIN
[1:44:46] <kenny_biff> the only thing is getting platinum and unlocking a secret dye for ghost armor. can't think of anything else
[1:44:48] <DSD24> @T_Sasquatch That's why I like it
[1:44:52] <OldManDeckardCain> just fak like it's the witcher Kappa
[1:44:52] <NotHereToStream> would you play the co op update?
[1:45:00] <+TheNeonGraveyard> Even if you liberate all the strongholds there's still mongols roaming around
[1:45:10] <+Aldesso> No New Game Plus Yet
[1:45:20] <AThing_> we got some work to do
[1:45:21] <@SoushinSen> it's not a newgame+, it's just post-game content
[1:45:26] <penitentpentwitch> This be Postgame
[1:45:31] <+jiggy_snipe> post game
[1:45:32] <+steelmorrigan> Post game
[1:45:36] <+zanzibar_junker> This is more Yakuza Premium Adventure Mode than ng+
[1:45:36] <GandhiTheTerrible> post game
[1:45:38] <%doomerskeletor13> Postgame shenanigans
[1:45:39] <DianaTheAscian> post game
[1:45:42] <armchairmaster_> Ghost of Tsushima 2 scans your save data to see what your choice was in Ghost 1. If you let Uncle live you get a dope horse, if you killed him lightning bolts periodically come down and zap you.
[1:45:54] <T_Sasquatch> New game + would be weird . How would you lose the first fight
[1:45:56] <%doomerskeletor13> @armchairmaster_ LUL
[1:46:20] <DSD24> @T_Sasquatch They could do it like Sekiro and have a archer shoot Jin real quick
[1:46:25] <RamenRiderZ> If you pick the kill ending the redditor ghosts will follow you and talk shit
[1:46:28] <+ShinobiPhoenix> oh good, a new horse to have killed
[1:46:29] <%cobalt_phoenix_> it kinda comes down to respecting their wishes vs your ideology
[1:46:32] <+steelmorrigan> Kill is the Kurosawa ending.
[1:46:34] <DSD24> hey
[1:46:35] <+Aldesso> Fuck Ideologies. Its about the Armor Color you get at th end
[1:46:36] <+steelmorrigan> :p
[1:46:44] <%Prevot> man it's not even close spare ending is weak af
[1:46:44] <Lynxystem> i still prefer spare, but now that ive seen both, there is no wrong choice.
[1:46:48] <Chatterbox1991> it depends on intent
[1:46:57] <+ShinobiPhoenix> I think Honor ending
[1:47:03] <%doomerskeletor13> I agree with Woolies rationale on it
[1:47:08] <T_Sasquatch> @aldesso to be honesttt . I chose white more than I care about which ideology
[1:47:12] <%Livelinne> Hm no actual depiction of kamikaze,then? shiaThink
[1:47:16] <DianaTheAscian> i pick the one with the cooler armor
[1:47:17] <%Exiliator> "Yeah I agree with Woolie, killing that guy was the right option!"
[1:47:23] <+ShinobiPhoenix> uncle was going to be killed by Shogun without his honor
[1:47:25] <%Exiliator> shit dont take that out of context
[1:47:36] <+rottingpastry> The game implies he'd be fine
[1:47:41] <sonofthedeepsouth> Kill your uncle to save him of the trouble
[1:47:46] <%Mr_Strut> I would have spared him, but certainly not out of mercy.
[1:47:49] <sonofthedeepsouth> gigabrain
[1:47:50] <T_Sasquatch> He really can just lie to the Shogun LUL 😂
[1:48:01] <sonofthedeepsouth> Nah uncle is too much HONOR
[1:48:04] <+Aldesso> @T_Sasquatch when i got to the chice i had to google what differs and when i read white ghost suit that bitch wuz already dead
[1:48:08] <+Sliverits> why are any of us alive, man. He's gotta find that meaning himself
[1:48:19] <@SoushinSen> lol WOolie asks reggie to explain his thoughts, but he ends up making explanation about his own himself
[1:48:30] <%Prevot> motherfuckers be like "I would never kill uncle" and then send him to die
[1:48:31] <RamenRiderZ> I wish there was a secret ending: Smoke bomb away
[1:48:32] <%doomerskeletor13> Minh lmao woolieMINHMAX
[1:48:37] <+steelmorrigan> @WoolieVersus I'll say it again Kill is what I consider canaon and also the "kurosawa" Ending
[1:48:45] <+ShinobiPhoenix> bear coming for his honor too
[1:48:47] <Lynxystem> anybody know if you can still get the white ghost suit if you spared him? lol
[1:48:48] <+jiggy_snipe> lol the no fight ending, you just leave
[1:48:48] <DianaTheAscian> Minh with the call outs
[1:48:48] <T_Sasquatch> Also let's be real , his uncle is a charicature ,a real person would never act that way
[1:48:50] <AThing_> minh throwing shade in the chat
[1:48:52] <%Shardlab> Then you make his choice for him. He won't honor your wishes or intent, so screw his
[1:48:59] <+TheNeonGraveyard> That was a shogun bear
[1:49:02] <+rottingpastry> 1. Fuck that dude, he's an asshole, who cares what he wants? 2. I refuse to murder people for dumb reasons.
[1:49:14] <DianaTheAscian> what ending did Minh pick?
[1:49:19] <%Livelinne> woolieMINHMAX woolieMINHMAX woolieMINHMAX
[1:49:32] <%Shardlab> He'd have run into a blender and died if not for Jin throwing his honor aside
[1:49:48] <danknugglit> Kurisawa grapling hooks
[1:49:49] <T_Sasquatch> Yknow everyone that spares lord shimura is more of a fuck you to him than sparing his life LUL
[1:49:52] <@SoushinSen> @DianaTheAscian I spared uncle because i refuse to abide by his "samurai" code, and i follow my own.
[1:49:53] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:49:54] <+Jaysky> Kill don't feel like the true ending. Walking away makes way more sense for Jim because he became the Ghost, not a samurai. What does the ghost care for honor in that moment
[1:49:59] <+ShinobiPhoenix> speaking of honor, kick that man off the cliff
[1:50:04] <+Jaysky> *Jin
[1:50:06] <DianaTheAscian> @SoushinSen nice
[1:50:11] <+Jaysky> Thanks autocorrect
[1:50:12] <%Shardlab> @T_Sasquatch That's.... perfectly fine
[1:50:17] <+rottingpastry> That too. The whole game is "fuck honor" so fuck honor.
[1:50:33] <misterurbanthelegend> Shogun would've had Ojuwe Shimura kill himself anyway though right? because Jin letting him live shows he fucked up twice.
[1:50:35] <%Shardlab> Your heart's still beating, old man. Stay mad
[1:50:40] <DSD24> What I like about the ending is that it can work both ways
[1:50:54] <%doomerskeletor13> My thinking on it is that Jin still has enough sentiment for his Uncle to abide his final request
[1:50:57] <+ShinobiPhoenix> the whole game is fuck YOUR honor, not fuck your uncle's honor
[1:51:02] <DSD24> Plus these discussion are cool
[1:51:13] <%Exiliator> Sure, but just like Jin argued "dont be a slave to honor", you shouldnt do the opposite either
[1:51:17] <danknugglit> Wall dosho
[1:51:18] <+Jaysky> Nah it was fuck Honor in general
[1:51:19] <Halospaz117> DAMN
[1:51:20] <%Josef_Stryker> PogChamp
[1:51:24] <+JingKaisean> MAX ACT
[1:51:29] <+ShinobiPhoenix> there's a world a difference between having no honor and having no respect
[1:51:30] <%Livelinne> Yea both outcomes are valid in their own way
[1:51:32] <%doomerskeletor13> woolieSMUG woolieSMUG woolieSMUG woolieSMUG
[1:51:34] <T_Sasquatch> @exiliator opposite being ?
[1:51:36] <%cobalt_phoenix_> light the liighthouse
[1:51:38] <%ZweihanderSteve> lol i guess i got here right after the ending or somey
[1:51:45] <%Livelinne> Story wise ofc
[1:52:00] <%doomerskeletor13> @zweihandersteve Ye they did both endings
[1:52:02] <%Exiliator> @T_Sasquatch I'm gonna be dishonorable even when I dont have to?
[1:52:03] <+rottingpastry> Shimura can make his own honor
[1:52:05] <%cobalt_phoenix_> i think the opposite would be doing the exact opposite of honor for the purpose of spiting honor
[1:52:12] <+ShinobiPhoenix> Jin threw away his honor to do what was right for his people, but I don't believe he would disrespect his uncle at the end
[1:52:18] <+TheNeonGraveyard> Anybody know if the merchants still sell the dyes in Kurosawa mode? Because that seems really counter intuitive
[1:52:25] <danknugglit> !MOTIVATED
[1:52:25] <@Moobot> 1734 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[1:52:29] <penitentpentwitch> The beacons are lit! Gondor calls for aid!
[1:52:37] <Tuna_Can_0> jump into some hay Kappa
[1:52:43] <+rottingpastry> It's not disrespect to not kill someone.
[1:52:48] <%Proxzo> Did woolie notice the Origami back at the house?
[1:52:55] <Shwepie> @ShinobiPhoenix I'd argue it's more finding your honor than fuck your honor. But that's mostly semantics and splitting hairs.
[1:52:58] <%ZweihanderSteve> oh cool there's two? nice. now just doing some extra stuff i take it.
[1:53:01] <misterurbanthelegend> FIGHT SUSANO'O DLC?
[1:53:01] <T_Sasquatch> I think kurosawa mode is just filter and doesn't change gameplay
[1:53:12] <+ShinobiPhoenix> Woolie's logic ALSO applies to Jin, if Jin didn't care about his uncle and he FULLY understood what was going to happen, he would walk away and not even give his uncle that fight
[1:53:13] <+Jaysky> @shinobiphoenix He would disrespect him cause he's done so throughout the whole game, he also basically said fuck the shogun.
[1:53:14] <%Exiliator> I think Jin's journey was more "dont let honor stand in your way" rather than "fuck honor its crap"
[1:53:15] <+rottingpastry> It's just a black and white filter, and it's really bleh
[1:53:25] <T_Sasquatch> I do want a full new game plus on kurosawa only
[1:53:28] <danknugglit> That white dye is sick

[1:53:52] <%Mr_Strut> Honor is a shit
[1:53:52] <%Prevot> haikus are dumb

[1:54:16] <Halospaz117> Very Kickass Game. Honor can suck a fat dick. Stabbing dudes is Fun

[1:54:36] <%The_Timo> Honor is a shit, Woolie can't count words that good, Tsushima good game
[1:54:36] <+Jaysky> If 2020 PS4 games have taught me anything this year it's that REVENGE BAD and HONOR BAD.
[1:54:40] <%doomerskeletor13> Woolie underwent his own character arc while playing this game

[1:55:03] <+jiggy_snipe> @ShinobiPhoenix yea I would have left and told him to eff off

[2:00:37] <%doomerskeletor13> STOLEN JOKE, NO HONOR
[2:00:37] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 11 minutes
[2:00:39] <%ZweihanderSteve> NO HONOR
[2:00:40] <%Reverend_Roscoe> YOU MADE THIS? I MADE THIS
[2:01:05] <%Reverend_Roscoe> NOT TRUE, I HAVE ONE AND A KID
[2:01:09] <+chiazam> Did they beat the game?
[2:01:11] <DianaTheAscian> its like those youtubers that use comments for material
[2:01:27] <DSD24> @chiazam Yes
[2:01:31] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @woolieversus that's like reading chat for material
[2:01:33] <+jiggy_snipe> won't the ghost be hunted on both endings?
[2:01:36] <%doomerskeletor13> @chiazam They did, both endings
[2:01:54] <T_Sasquatch> That's what hurts my brain . How can one feel so delusional in their ideology that they would kill their son
[2:01:58] <T_Sasquatch> Its insane
[2:02:02] <penitentpentwitch> "I have no choice!" "You can just not do it." "But honor though!"
[2:02:04] <GandhiTheTerrible> As Jin says, he's a slave to honor
[2:02:12] <%doomerskeletor13> @t_sasquatch I mean it happens a lot in history
[2:02:27] <+ShinobiPhoenix> Everyone: Why can't you just use Rollback Japanese devs: *crying* I have no choice!
[2:02:32] <jorniev> he paused when jin told him he was a slave to his honor
[2:02:33] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @T_Sasquatch i'd like to introduce you to [insert religion here]
[2:02:37] <%doomerskeletor13> @shinobiphoenix LUL
[2:02:40] <yusefHD> how do you live with the pain my Lord?
[2:02:48] <T_Sasquatch> That would be wild
[2:02:58] <%Exiliator> Familial connections are not the same for everyone
[2:03:05] <T_Sasquatch> that would be such a stronger ending
[2:03:08] <%Lion_kun> Thats his choice to be a slave to honor
[2:03:13] <%CptnCampy61> Real high
[2:03:16] <%Reverend_Roscoe> he absolutely killed himself
[2:03:32] <%Lion_kun> Jin chooses to be free by not partaking in outdated concepts.
[2:03:36] <Lynxystem> Yeah the english delivery of "you are a SLAVE to your honor" is like, hes trying not to yell. much calmer in japanese
[2:03:38] <+Jaysky> Cause there's a percentage of him still living
[2:03:38] <+ShinobiPhoenix> Honor is Delay-based
[2:03:42] <Railgun5> I'm pretty sure in the epilogue there's a section where Jin says his uncle is still alive
[2:03:49] <+ohb1988> I killed his uncle cos fuck feudalism
[2:03:57] <+agent_raiken> you wouldint becasuse "fuck honor. dont put that evil on me ricky bobby"
[2:04:13] <T_Sasquatch> Good writing overall
[2:04:16] <Tuna_Can_0> atpCap
[2:04:16] <%doomerskeletor13> Me and Woolie are definitely on the same train of thought with the ending
[2:04:17] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:04:26] <%Exiliator> I like to see it as Jin also showing that he wasn't dishonorable just for the sake of it, but rather because he thought it was right
[2:04:30] <%Prevot> every defense of spare ending sounds like a baby throwing a fit saying "fuck honor"
[2:04:39] <+ShinobiPhoenix> I also need lunch, I need to wash Minecraft Steve from my mouth
[2:04:40] <%paladinstarbuster> is woolie saying he SHOULD kill his uncle?
[2:04:41] <GandhiTheTerrible> ""morally grey""
[2:04:42] <SomersaultJustice> so kirby fighters 2 tonight right Kappa
[2:04:43] <%ZweihanderSteve> early lunch and a naaaaaaaap
[2:04:43] <alephalpha> WAIT
[2:04:46] <alephalpha> 13 SENTINELS
[2:05:04] <alephalpha> oh
[2:05:04] <+jiggy_snipe> well Jin adopted the ghost persona cuz the samurai honor bs wasn't going to win that war
[2:05:05] <DSD24> @alephalpha Its Woolie and Pat talking about ti
[2:05:08] <alephalpha> I justa rrived
[2:05:12] <penitentpentwitch> Enjoy Fud
[2:05:12] <+ShinobiPhoenix> @paladinstarbuster no, he's saying Jin should respect the wishes of his uncle
[2:05:13] <alephalpha> I though this wa soyur schedule
[2:05:18] <alephalpha> sorry
[2:05:26] <%doomerskeletor13> A plethora of content on the channel atm
[2:05:29] <%ZweihanderSteve> pat did a decent job with that pitch
[2:05:36] <%Livelinne> We need a Morally Gray emote
[2:05:44] <UndeadImpulse> I think the weird thing that I don't like about the Spare ending is that Jin says; "I have no honor, but I won't kill my family", which seems odd. The way Jin makes it sound is that Giving him an honorable death is not honorable?
[2:05:46] <+ShinobiPhoenix> OOOOOOO... X-Men COTA
[2:05:47] <DSD24> Morally g r e y
[2:05:49] <penitentpentwitch> WoolieVersus Going Under for ultimate soul destruction!

[2:08:08] <+ShinobiPhoenix> so yeah, I think Woolie beat it before he did
[2:08:15] <%Josef_Stryker> But I'd rather he start at 0 or do Judgement
