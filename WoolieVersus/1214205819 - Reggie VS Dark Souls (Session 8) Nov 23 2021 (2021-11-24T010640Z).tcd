[0:01:37] <@Solidus_113> not the game The Good Life
[0:01:40] <@Menitta> it's a really interesting show, especially for a comedy
[0:01:43] <jorniev> YOU CANT actually get in the good place
[0:01:47] <%patriotrenegade> Yeah, yeah, the time knife.
[0:01:49] <+ds3namecaldara> fextraRomeoGib
[0:01:58] <%Josef_Stryker> The point system just got too complicated over time

[0:02:18] <NeoNeonNero> born hollow
[0:02:19] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> MANDKIND KNEW
[0:02:21] <%holydeviant1> THe point of the show is rthat the connectiveness of the world fucked over the system of the afterlife
[0:02:21] <%Dakuu75> that's a NO TOLERANCE policy dude. lmao
[0:02:21] <%TheBesteban> Make content? Straight to hell

[0:02:25] <%KiwamiKiryu> great show üëåüèº
[0:02:26] <%hax_metatron> The whole point of the show is how base-level reading of morality of heaven and hell absolutely sucks!
[0:02:26] <LVL1_Scumbag> It's original sin all over again
[0:02:27] <@Solidus_113> But I thought Jesus was made to cleanse those sins
[0:02:29] <Dova573> Fuck that
[0:02:31] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> so good
[0:02:31] <%X2Eliah> Yep. Tho also the show heros are kinda shitty people

[0:02:53] <%VictorVonLouche> Nazis
[0:02:54] <+profanityincluded> LUL
[0:02:54] <%hax_metatron> There's an "algorithm" in the show and it starts messing up basically, dooming entire generations of humans to hell
[0:02:56] <kingra> They were nazis LUL
[0:02:58] <+Reverend_Roscoe> They're SS
[0:02:59] <%RemedyofRevenge> they are playing nazi soldiers
[0:03:01] <+Bitscreed> They're literal Nazis Woolie LUL
[0:03:11] <%cisealnine> They were playing WWI German soldiers, I believe.

[0:03:53] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:03:57] <bear_breaker20> i will now refer to all versions of Hell as 'the corner'
[0:04:09] <%holydeviant1> I think they mention the last person to hit the Good Place was Abraham Lincoln or something
[0:04:09] <%RemedyofRevenge> what is bottled water, but enslaved moisture?
[0:04:10] <%Lion_kun> When Lions eat Gazelle, are they not exploiting the Gazelle?
[0:04:12] <%Dakuu75> that's rough
[0:04:13] <@Solidus_113> world is a fuck
[0:04:16] <bear_breaker20> youll go to the corner cuase jesus died for nothing
[0:04:16] <%cobalt_phoenix_> nothing
[0:04:22] <%cobalt_phoenix_> literally nothing
[0:04:25] <@Menitta> So the response is "fuck it"
[0:04:31] <%Irridium> @RemedyofRevenge stolen from native lands at that
[0:04:36] <%mr_sups> Living in Qubec, and how that land was created and ran

[0:04:39] <%cisealnine> Why is there adamantium in your phone?
[0:04:46] <+Bitscreed> The premise of The Good Place is basically that "none of you are free of sin" dril tweet.
[0:04:57] <%Juriasu> oh shit

[0:05:03] <%TheJaydedFox> TheJaydedFox subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months!

[0:05:07] <+BananaSlammuh> What about my special embossed holy water cross?
[0:05:12] <Duskendawn> "World is a fuck" is a dialogue choice in smt5 lol
[0:05:16] <leith_aziz> I guess I can be happy on the fact that I never feel like gettting a new phone
[0:05:22] <@Menitta> Ah man I'm pissed I wasn't looking at chat during that.

[0:06:42] <%asdief_> that's what the suburbs are for
[0:06:42] <%patriotrenegade> Max's enthusiasm for Project L is kind of concering

[0:07:23] <+Stupid121v2> just be chill about things
[0:07:24] <%Juriasu> I think a lot of bullshit in the world could be made to be less bullshit, but most people don't really have any power to change them and it sucks
[0:07:24] <andre11dr> I'm still confused, who was Woolie talking about?
[0:07:25] <%Dakuu75> put that on a shirt

[0:08:28] <urkleturtle> this reminds me of normaling from 30rock
[0:08:33] <@Menitta> I like winter because it gives me an excuse to wear baselayer turtlenecks
[0:08:37] <andre11dr> That's everything really
[0:08:40] <Xaeveax> Why does everything seem to need to have the term "core" attached to it now? It's really annoting.
[0:08:45] <Xaeveax> annoying*

[0:19:14] <peachy996> Hey I wanna know: How's the music for netflix bebop? Any new stuff? Any updated stuff?
[0:19:19] <NeoNeonNero> DIE HARD ANIME?
[0:19:24] <+VforValensa> we got some of those
[0:19:25] <+eanscrale> It worked for The Matrix and Star Wars
[0:19:26] <andre11dr> Didn't Star Wars do that?
[0:19:28] <%Theycallmenerf> Fuck that would be so cool
[0:19:29] <+VforValensa> blade runner anime
[0:19:29] <elshadow7> Star wars visions was alright, for the most part
[0:19:30] <%X2Eliah> Anime version of Arnie's "Commando" would be rad
[0:19:33] <+Pleblu> @peachy996 A few new ones
[0:19:33] <youngking_kush> Die Hard by Ufotable
[0:19:39] <%Dapper_Cactuar> apparently the live action adaptations of Cromartie High and Gokusen were good
[0:19:39] <+VforValensa> Animatrix

[0:19:51] <+Shishi1205> Bro the ost bangsd

[0:19:58] <+profanityincluded> Baywatch by xebec
[0:20:00] <+addMoreCoffee> An anime of the Silent Hill movie.
[0:20:00] <jorniev> REMEMBER: the SUPERNATURAL anime.
[0:20:00] <@Solidus_113> Toys in the Attic
[0:20:06] <peachy996> Cuz man Faye does fuck all in that movie
[0:20:11] <Xaeveax> Flight of the Concords anime done by Science Saru.
[0:20:18] <peachy996> Or the game from Japan
[0:20:20] <Deewtssob> Hideki Anno Sopranos
[0:20:35] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Toys in the Attic 2 is in Sapce Dandy
[0:20:37] <peachy996> The game from Japan had a new story and I think it would benefit taking a new spin on that
[0:20:39] <SIydoc> hello everyone
[0:20:40] <+Makouzer> ed became a whiteboy for liveaction, canon future
[0:20:42] <Iniudan> Should have went one episode deeper, you 7th is heavy metal queen, if I remember right, VT my favorite character of the show. =p
[0:20:44] <%Juriasu> @Deewtssob Shin Sopranos
[0:20:45] <+addMoreCoffee> Miyazaki's Dune.
[0:20:57] <bear_breaker20> this is exemplified in how Spike climbs the eternal staricase while high***
[0:21:04] <@Solidus_113> no you have to humanize vicious
[0:21:05] <urkleturtle> yeah, just a glimpse into their life
[0:21:09] <derap41> forget about it
[0:21:16] <derap41> its over its gone
[0:21:20] <derap41> never to come back
[0:21:23] <toulon_somberjade> There is a Supernatural Anime
[0:21:23] <peachy996> Turning it into a longrunning theme was one foible
[0:21:24] <%X2Eliah> Yes, but... casual audiences
[0:21:27] <%Juriasu> he just sucks, even in the anime
[0:21:27] <%baka_sugoi> baka_sugoi subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! ayy 14 moths strong and enjoying reggies souls a lot woolieFUN
[0:21:31] <+Pleblu> Vicious is in it a looot
[0:21:36] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> It's for the people screaming for PLOT
[0:21:38] <peachy996> I hear they don't go to Callisto and I'm disappointed
[0:21:39] <%Dapper_Cactuar> then you get actors from the live action version saying that their version "fixes" Cowboy Bebop
[0:21:39] <%AbnormalVoid> That's how I feel about Sephiroth in FFVII Remake
[0:21:47] <Xaeveax> There's no way this live action is going to be anywhere near as good. It feels like they are missing the point.
[0:21:52] <+anoldtoilet> its really bad
[0:21:57] <bear_breaker20> everbody who actually cares enough didnt give a shit even when it was first announced tbh
[0:21:57] <+MarkUriah> @Dapper_Cactuar ow ouch pain
[0:21:59] <Deewtssob> Netflix‚Äôs Vicious and Julia are literally just Netflix‚Äôs Light and Misa again
[0:22:00] <derap41> Its not good
[0:22:02] <+anoldtoilet> woolie look up the blackmail black male line
[0:22:02] <%cobalt_phoenix_> i just heard what the end for the live action is and just.... wooooow
[0:22:03] <%RemedyofRevenge> @WoolieVersus its like showing too much of the monster in your horror movie. If you see it in too clear detail, it loses its punch and mystery
[0:22:04] <+profanityincluded> Dont care, Didnt watch, Plus youre Live Action LUL
[0:22:04] <%Theycallmenerf> Studio Ghibli presents: Pans Labyrinth  or Studio Ghibli presents: Chronicles of Narnia
[0:22:06] <peachy996> It'll never be good but I don't mind it being different
[0:22:06] <+anoldtoilet> i dare you
[0:22:11] <andre11dr> Nah leave it alone
[0:22:13] <%X2Eliah> watch the wheel of time show on amazon instead.
[0:22:15] <Xaeveax> @Theycallmenerf Both would work well
[0:22:19] <peachy996> It's not like the good Bebop is going anywhere
[0:22:22] <jorniev> COWBOY BEBOPis about the past cathing up to you, SAMURAI champloo its about the uncertain future, and SPACE DANDY is always dandy (about the present)
[0:22:23] <%Juriasu> @X2Eliah is it good?
[0:22:23] <+anoldtoilet> its not good but different, its just really bad
[0:22:25] <%Theycallmenerf> David Productions presents: Lord of The Rings
[0:22:27] <KyberNasse> The live action One Piece NotLikeThis
[0:22:28] <agustorm123> Is better to don‚Äôt touch it
[0:22:29] <derap41> Avatar next to be live action
[0:22:32] <%TheOddJik> Even if its not great, I hate when people personally attack the actors.
[0:22:34] <%X2Eliah> @Juriasu its decent so far
[0:22:39] <+Stupid121v2> that shits stupid
[0:22:39] <peachy996> Also adapt Sympathy For The Devil into the live action you cowards
[0:22:41] <+vaderxyz1970> Space dandy is defite
[0:22:43] <%Bluwizard21> carole and tuesday has such the same feel
[0:22:43] <+anoldtoilet> live action one piece is going to be extremel,y bad but the casting is better than i could have ever hoped for
[0:22:43] <%guiltyboya> Netflix Cowboy beebop, I like it. It's definitely not my good old anime, but it's okay as its own thing. Made me laugh more than once
[0:22:43] <+2sappy> Gimme a follow up to Mushroom Samba where they all just get high again.
[0:22:43] <@Solidus_113> I believe it
[0:22:46] <Futurecity10> Carol and Tuesday is Alternate timeline stuff
[0:22:48] <+Jiggisnipe> all Capcom games that use Zenny take place in the same universe Kappa
[0:22:48] <+anoldtoilet> itll be weird if its good but it might be.
[0:22:50] <peachy996> Shoot Wen in the head
[0:22:52] <%asdief_> Someday we'll get a live action AKIRA, and it'll be hilarious
[0:22:55] <+Shishi1205> @Theycallmenerf gandalf vs balrog dio vs jotaro style
[0:22:56] <glass_marcus> the watanabe verse is tied together by that currency
[0:22:56] <%swesterly> Maybe the best form a piece of art exists in is the medium it was originally presented
[0:22:57] <bear_breaker20> "You are black... and you are male." Like AS IF its not supposed to be bad
[0:23:05] <%Juriasu> @X2Eliah I read the books like 20 years ago, I kind of just remember there being a lot of filler
[0:23:09] <+Pleblu> @asdief_ Thatd be weird
[0:23:09] <jorniev> SPACE DANDY totally has the fridge from monsters in the attic episode from cowboy bebop
[0:23:20] <%Bread_Assassin> Wasn‚Äôt that confirmed?
[0:23:21] <+profanityincluded> So Excel Saga is also canon in teh watanabe-verse?
[0:23:24] <%Theycallmenerf> @shishi1205 [SHALL NOT PASS]
[0:23:25] <+SunsetLaw> ey woolie where is the new podcast episode it's not in my podcatcher yet aaaaah
[0:23:29] <%X2Eliah> @Juriasu i think they for sure are cutting and optimizing to avoid a real slog
[0:23:31] <+Shishi1205> @asdief_ Bro that movie has been in production hell for years
[0:23:32] <%KellBeII> theres a few weapons that can still do it as of 2.  they seem to have been fully removed in 3
[0:23:32] <Puhff> GUMBO GAME
[0:23:35] <andre11dr> Didn't DS2 have combos?
[0:23:42] <%Theycallmenerf> SHEILD COUNTERS ARE THE SHIT
[0:23:44] <+anoldtoilet> wheel of time adaptation seems bad too
[0:23:45] <%cobalt_phoenix_> THE THING
[0:23:45] <Xaeveax> I hope Elden Ring secretly has a firearm-like weapon that functions like Bloodborne. Loved that system.
[0:23:45] <gryffinp> Oh man that big thing
[0:23:48] <peachy996> @swesterly constantly going to our past and trying to recreate it is hurting us more than if we let it inspire to create new works of art
[0:23:49] <gryffinp> can't wait for the big thing
[0:23:52] <agustorm123> @bear_breaker20 Is suppose to be like that Kappa
[0:23:52] <+anoldtoilet> they arent really cutting stuff as much as theyre adding new, worse stuff
[0:23:54] <+Stupid121v2> @SunsetLaw he cant control the uploads unfortunately, its just up when its up
[0:23:56] <+mitchpitchfork> ds2 was all about weapon combos
[0:24:05] <%asdief_> @asdief_ I can dream or have nightmares
[0:24:05] <%Theycallmenerf> BIG OL THING
[0:24:06] <andre11dr> Actually wait DS3 had combos, you would combo into the weapon art
[0:24:07] <%Juriasu> I'm gonna get a juicebox from my fridge
[0:24:16] <%shakespearo> @mitchpitchfork dual avelyns best build

[0:25:50] <+Stupid121v2> abuse the press turn homie
[0:25:50] <bear_breaker20> smt's party building system is all about taking a turn based battle and making it an auto battle
[0:26:00] <BlueEagle2395> if enemies cheese you, you gotta cheese em back yep
[0:26:00] <%sewermonk> what does press turn even mean
[0:26:05] <%amaranthos> Good Midday Woolsworth and Reggarth
[0:26:08] <%TheBesteban> Unless your enemy crits you on a sneak attack in which case through the Switch out the window
[0:26:15] <%akajaybay> Always carry spyglasses. Don't waste time guessing. Maybe save status effect attacks for liek your last possible turn
[0:26:15] <%TheBesteban> throw*
[0:26:21] <+Stupid121v2> you pressed them so you get another turn? idk lol

[0:26:44] <%TheBesteban> FUCK
[0:26:47] <wanderingdain90> best way to beat smt 5 is gain more turns and take away your enemies
[0:26:51] <%Theycallmenerf> Woolie are you excited for Legendary‚Äôs Live Action Gundam from the guy who directed Kong Skull Island?
[0:26:52] <Duskendawn> Press turn is persona's "one more"

[0:34:14] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> PUT IT ALL IN RES
[0:34:15] <andre11dr> The best set is Giants armour and Father Mask Kappa
[0:34:16] <+Shishi1205> now that I think about it why is the dark sun ring in the catacombs?
[0:34:16] <elshadow7> Ornstein's armor is absurdly cool
[0:34:21] <urkleturtle> especially the female one with the feather collar
[0:34:34] <th3_gaming_dumb> How long has the stream been up
[0:34:44] <elshadow7> I'm still salty they never put a 'Restored' Artorias' armor in ds3
[0:34:45] <%X2Eliah> we toothpicking?

[0:35:42] <%X2Eliah> @Peterbyte_ shhhhhhhhhhh
[0:35:42] <youngking_kush> Reggie gotta use THE Boss Weapon
[0:35:49] <youngking_kush> He's perfect for it
[0:36:07] <%vVAstrAVv> mlgs is best boy
[0:36:07] <+anoldtoilet> yeah he did make a moonlight build by accident
[0:36:09] <%Finnmac5> Yo shit THE boss weapon is actually perfect for Reggarth
[0:36:09] <andre11dr> @shishi1205 But he could've done it without it ,he was killing them in one hit
[0:36:10] <%Theycallmenerf> OH THATS THE BUILD
[0:36:13] <elshadow7> Moonlight would be hype
[0:36:17] <%Peterbyte_> better start pumping int
[0:36:25] <+Shishi1205> @andre11dr but they would have respawned first time
[0:36:31] <gryffinp> isn't the MLGS a tail cut rather than a proper "boss weapon"?
[0:36:34] <+TheFrancix> MOONLIGHT
[0:36:37] <%Bread_Assassin> Reggie can always do a magic infusion.
[0:36:37] <+Shishi1205> he can revert it anytime
[0:36:37] <%vVAstrAVv> hes gonna hate getting that tail tho
[0:36:40] <elshadow7> It's Seath's tail
[0:36:42] <%X2Eliah> ok ok ok ok listen, but what if quality tho
[0:36:43] <%mr_sups> I GOT BOSS WEAPONS!

[0:37:54] <%KeiganOfAstora> Such a dumb helmet lol
[0:37:59] <%CommanderSqueaks> Inosuke helmet represent
[0:37:59] <+Shishi1205> Bro the other day I saw the hitbox for a tail cut and man thats super bs
[0:38:07] <%amaranthos> It's an amazing helmet
[0:38:08] <%baka_sugoi> The helmet stays on during sex
[0:38:10] <%holydeviant1> honestly iron boar is growing on me
[0:38:11] <$eco419> !MOTIVATED
[0:38:11] <@Moobot> @eco419 2382 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[0:38:16] <NeoNeonNero> PIG HELMET IS AWESOME
[0:38:16] <%Wouldz> never got that helmet :(
[0:38:16] <%Bread_Assassin> As he should be
[0:38:22] <%CommanderSqueaks> The helmet stays ON
[0:38:22] <%Lordgale119> after drawing Reggie in that helmet, I'll honestly be disappointed if he swaps now
[0:38:28] <CrowbarFacelift> Reggarth the Boar
[0:38:32] <%X2Eliah> Hey lets be fair at least Reggie didnt use the Drake sword
[0:38:41] <%amaranthos> Boarman the Reggarth
[0:38:44] <Duskendawn> Seath's tail was a PITA to cut, hurtbox is literally just the tip
[0:38:56] <%Lordgale119> he used drake for like 20 minutes and then said "nah"
[0:38:58] <NeoNeonNero> Reggarth the Lucky Boar
[0:39:00] <Iniudan> @Wouldz THen you never killed all the pig, you are sure to get it if you kill the last one, if I remember right.
[0:39:00] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:39:03] <+TheFrancix> BECOME GIANT
[0:39:04] <+Shishi1205> @X2Eliah he did for a bit but with his lucky drops he doessnt need
[0:39:07] <Srgoatz> i remember the boar helmet being DUMB heavy
[0:39:09] <andre11dr> The boar helm ,is a mark of Reggie at this point
[0:39:11] <%amaranthos> Pig of luck and capitalism
[0:39:20] <%holydeviant1> why is the waistcloth so good?!
[0:39:21] <%KeiganOfAstora> The only reason to upgrade things is so that you and enemies die in more or less hits, respectively
[0:39:25] <%X2Eliah> @Srgoatz its pretty ok, if you pair it with lighter armours
[0:39:29] <@Solidus_113> I took that waistcloth to +5 because it's real good
[0:39:30] <gespenstkick> Reggarth the piggy bank
[0:39:37] <elshadow7> Was upgrading armor worth it in DS1? I played a fuckton but never bothered to
[0:39:41] <%cobalt_phoenix_> man i wish they had added the direct comparison sooner
[0:39:42] <%Dakuu75> @holydeviant1 keeps the crotch warm and toasty
[0:39:48] <andre11dr> @holydeviant1 Cause it has really good poise ,for some reason
[0:39:49] <%KellBeII> @elshadow7 yes
[0:39:49] <sendart> wolf ring tho
[0:39:53] <+sund0wner> @elshadow7 Depends on your play style but yeah
[0:39:53] <youngking_kush> Reggie hasn't had a fast roll all game
[0:39:53] <LunarRemix> Defense makes a huge difference in this game
[0:39:57] <velgaduere> Wolf Ring will patch that right up
[0:39:58] <%ozzrabbit> (TRY THE MASK OF THE CHILD)
[0:39:59] <%Lion_kun> You can upgrade armor in DS1 which I never bothered to do.
[0:40:02] <@Solidus_113> the crimson and gold-hemmed sets are both quality
[0:40:04] <%X2Eliah> wolf ring 40 poise free
[0:40:07] <Srgoatz> oh i rocket with the boar helmet my first time through DS1
[0:40:13] <%RemedyofRevenge> Reggie with the rare problem of having so much good luck on item drops, he is spoiled for choice
[0:40:16] <Iniudan> @elshadow7 yes, on regular armor it can more double their defense if you max them.
[0:40:18] <Srgoatz> rocked*
[0:40:19] <OfficerMods> don't bother that boar helm isn't coming off anytime soon
[0:40:26] <+blink289> looked away for a sec did I miss any anor londo or did it just start
[0:40:28] <urkleturtle> oh right he already has the rite
[0:40:29] <CrowbarFacelift> I‚Äôm kinda glad they removed the ability to upgrade armor
[0:40:29] <%Lordgale119> midrolling with huge poise is a perfectly fine result tbh
[0:40:32] <%Lion_kun> I did a shirtless strength run because it looked cool.
[0:40:34] <urkleturtle> that'll help a ton
[0:40:36] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ay
[0:40:40] <%cobalt_phoenix_> very handy
[0:40:42] <+Shishi1205> free 15 indeed
[0:40:48] <elshadow7> Huh, interesting
[0:40:49] <+Shishi1205> HypeScream
[0:40:53] <Iniudan> @elshadow7  armor that upgrade with twinkling it more like 50% upgrade when maxed.
[0:40:54] <%hax_metatron> LUL he'll trounce Anor Londo, maybe the archers will be an issue but that's it
[0:40:56] <andre11dr> Remember when you could flip around in full havel's before they patched it,those where crazy times
[0:40:58] <OfficerMods> Anal rodeo mini bar is always stacked
[0:40:59] <%holydeviant1> Is it 10 normal, or is that only at "kept" fires? I forgot
[0:41:05] <%amaranthos> there's a stage past 15 sips
[0:41:05] <%brisk_dacat> No one sips like ole 15 sips
[0:41:12] <%amaranthos> to go even further beyond
[0:41:15] <%X2Eliah> @holydeviant1 5 base,  10 at kept
[0:41:24] <%holydeviant1> That's what I thought
[0:41:24] <Duskendawn> Why not kindle to 20 here?
[0:41:28] <%debrv> So.... We comin' for Laurtecs ass?
[0:41:32] <elshadow7> @Iniudan I think the Silver Knight set was the only one I ever upgraded now that I think about it
[0:41:38] <youngking_kush> @hax_metatron Idk, arent the enemies her Magic resistant
[0:41:42] <%jepupu> Wait, I missed the archers?
[0:41:43] <%X2Eliah> aw Lautrec is Reggie's bro
[0:41:50] <%holydeviant1> Silver Knight's is alright, wish it came with the cape
[0:41:52] <Darren716> jepupu lol no, they havent moved
[0:41:52] <andre11dr> @debrv That is faaaaar away friend
[0:41:57] <%jepupu> Oh, ok
[0:42:02] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Duskendawn they're only kindling because they had the spare humanity
[0:42:02] <+Shishi1205> If you don't mind walking this bonfire is good for 20 but you might want something with her
[0:42:02] <%debrv> Attunement for the love of God.
[0:42:09] <youngking_kush> MLGS or bust
[0:42:10] <Iniudan> @elshadow7 silver knight is a twinkling upgrade one if I remember right.
[0:42:16] <%X2Eliah> ye
[0:42:18] <%Lordgale119> @Iniudan silver knight chest with elite knight helm is THE BEST fashion mix in this game
[0:42:18] <elshadow7> @Iniudan Yeap
[0:42:19] <+Shishi1205> 28 baby
[0:42:21] <%X2Eliah> sliver knight is twikly
[0:42:22] <+anoldtoilet> i have literally never upgraded vit and endurance this much
[0:42:26] <%cobalt_phoenix_> gotta get big smarts
[0:42:27] <Duskendawn> Ah right gotcha
[0:42:28] <%holydeviant1> Popping something to 20 is usually a good idea, because extra sips stick around
[0:42:29] <OblivionSword1> there's one cool one if reggie manage to get it in the future
[0:42:29] <OfficerMods> no way lautriic or biggie smalls is happening today. You know exactly what is happening today though, you sick freaks.
[0:42:34] <+foomaster22> We never saw Big Hat in Firelink
[0:42:36] <%patriotrenegade> Crystal Weapon Bastard Sword Kreygasm
[0:42:36] <+Shishi1205> thank god I used it in Bloodborne man it's so cool there
[0:42:40] <%swesterly> Thank Christ Reggie isn‚Äôt looking at chat, you idiots literally can‚Äôt not post about things that haven‚Äôt happened yet
[0:42:44] <elshadow7> @Iniudan Silver knight set always looks incredible
[0:42:45] <andre11dr> He has the doll so he might just get stuck in the Painted World for the whole session
[0:42:45] <Iniudan> @lordgale119 my favorite helm is giant helm.
[0:42:46] <+profanityincluded> got like 35K in pockets
[0:42:52] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> can Reggie spend that fire keeper soul now??
[0:42:55] <%Lordgale119> Giant is respectable
[0:42:57] <+robertoszek> @OfficerMods sm64?
[0:42:57] <%X2Eliah> @OfficerMods but what if
[0:43:01] <+anoldtoilet> endurance is pretty much a waste of a stat if you think of it in terms of "swings" instead of numbers. you can put like a handful of points into it and get enough to get one more swing or one more roll after a combo
[0:43:02] <gryffinp> @andre11dr low key hoping for this
[0:43:04] <Darren716> Honestly he should hold onto his souls for Big Hat's quest
[0:43:06] <%holydeviant1> @abelincoln_catpuncher spicy soul is later
[0:43:09] <@Solidus_113> 2 levels
[0:43:13] <%debrv> @officermods I think he got this.
[0:43:14] <+anoldtoilet> but dumping points into it doesnt matter unless you NEED big armor
[0:43:20] <gryffinp> there goes my hero....
[0:43:34] <%hax_metatron> Put the boss souls away LUL
[0:43:38] <+Shishi1205> giving me 10k
[0:43:51] <Iniudan> @lordgale119 just wish I could get giant helm in black to with with steel armor.
[0:43:55] <OblivionSword1> looks good
[0:43:56] <+trackles_64> if uyour not crafting boss weapons ushould use then
[0:44:02] <andre11dr> So chat, I'm taking bets ,how many deaths on the rafters?

[0:45:21] <%hax_metatron> I think Reggie might two shot these sentinels
[0:45:21] <slix3431> I totally missed Sen's
[0:45:27] <Iniudan> @Peterbyte_ no, it is a split damage weapon, no split damage weapon are buffable.
[0:45:28] <+Shishi1205> don't think you can buff it

[1:00:50] <NeoNeonNero> YOOOOOOOOO
[1:00:52] <+stantashev> halberd?
[1:00:54] <LunarRemix> Now he even got the Gargoyle's Halberd lol
[1:00:54] <%KeiganOfAstora> No one could realistically wield this heavy weapon with one arm
[1:00:55] <%X2Eliah> ! halberd !
[1:00:56] <%Lordgale119> boss aggro
[1:00:57] <OldManDeckardCain> ok, but seriously... reggie needs to get into gachas LUL
[1:01:06] <%Bread_Assassin> And the halberd, too.
[1:01:09] <pennykettle_> I used the Gargoyle axe for a while after the boss
[1:01:13] <+Bitscreed> Enough rare weapon drops to build his own iron throne.
[1:01:16] <andre11dr> Ok ,trying to invade now
[1:01:17] <%KeiganOfAstora> The Titanite Catch Pole is the same moveset as Halberd
[1:01:17] <%X2Eliah> Oh that descrip got updated
[1:01:21] <derap41> This weapon is so dumb
[1:01:22] <LVL1_Scumbag> Floppy axe
[1:01:23] <%hax_metatron> That's a weird item description
[1:01:26] <bear_breaker20> that gargoyle came over to give you weapons, not fight
[1:01:27] <@Solidus_113> flaccid
[1:01:28] <+Hollow_Mirage> The LIVING AXE
[1:01:37] <ALvl78Zapdos> Reggarth literally using all his RNG in DS1.
[1:01:45] <gespenstkick> Man, I remember expecting a whip axe
[1:01:46] <agustorm123> Good weapon
[1:01:49] <%linSP> The peen axe
[1:01:55] <%cobalt_phoenix_> LIES
[1:02:05] <brunoberserk> i think that  ex-bosses enemies have a bigger aggro range ,
[1:02:08] <@Solidus_113> big buff
[1:02:10] <sendart> axe sucks halberd okay
[1:02:10] <+Shishi1205> r2
[1:02:12] <wantedsafe471> lightning or chaos gargs halberd is pretty good

[1:02:42] <%cobalt_phoenix_> it just sucks the stats weren't that great compared to other stuff
[1:02:49] <+Hollow_Mirage> Its just the PLUCK Sword but a Axe
[1:02:51] <peachy996> It's no Arm
[1:02:51] <elshadow7> I refuse to believe that wasn't a bug they couldn't fix and just went "eh, fuck it, it's a feature now"
[1:02:54] <Duskendawn> Looks jank tbh
[1:02:56] <+kevlarkoala> @cobalt_phoenix_ some of that stuff really only matters for PVP though
[1:02:56] <+Shishi1205> trash tbh
[1:02:59] <bear_breaker20> its...it may as well be a giant dick...
[1:02:59] <agustorm123> That weapon can kill the person using it

[1:05:35] <+Ultimate_Edge> Placing messages in Elden Ring will be a fun game of its own
[1:05:43] <andre11dr> There's some shit in Elden Ring that looks like you're braking the game, but you're supposed to do it

[1:43:49] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus The corpse is directly below the broken window up on the top floor, so it seems to me that Tarkus took one step onto the rafters and fell straight to his death

[2:05:43] <%hiswill98> Is FromSoft gonna sell the Painted World as an NFT?
[2:05:43] <+mechslayer71> they need that money to Defend the Land against the Genocidal Humanoidz
[2:05:45] <„Éè„ÇØ„Ç¢> but it's the future woolie
[2:05:55] <+robertoszek> Look at this NFT, everytime I do it makes me laugh

[2:06:04] <dai_tonight> ???
[2:06:07] <OldManDeckardCain> is soad still a thing? ddn't they fall apart because one of them voted for trump or something LUL
[2:06:10] <andre11dr> Mike Dean got flack for doing the NFT shit
[2:06:11] <dundore77> i mean Serj outright said Soad went on hiatus cause he was selfish and wanted to do his solo stuff.
[2:06:11] <cj_art> Never forget kizuna ai nfts
[2:06:17] <%CommanderSqueaks> @OldManDeckardCain That is hilarious if true
[2:06:21] <+profanityincluded> Gorillaz fell for the NFT shit too? how am i not surprised
[2:06:27] <dai_tonight> post malone is also doing NFTs
[2:06:29] <agustorm123> Moss could be good
[2:06:30] <pennykettle_> you would have knocked out your teeth there
[2:06:31] <%hax_metatron> Yes
[2:06:32] <gespenstkick> Yes
[2:06:34] <%cobalt_phoenix_> yes
[2:06:34] <%AbnormalVoid> that's the intended place
[2:06:36] <QueequegTheater> @cj_art FeelsBadMan
[2:06:36] <+TheFrancix> yea
[2:06:39] <Admiral_PopnFresh> The helmet and confined space is making me nausious
[2:06:42] <%IronOhki> Chat: Lore wize, why is there an egg vermifuge here? Is this related to King Jerry?
[2:06:43] <OldManDeckardCain> I think it wa the drummer
[2:06:45] <LoreKeeper_Thal> out of JOOS
[2:06:48] <pennykettle_> LUL humanity heals incoming
[2:06:50] <%Juriasu> try tongue, but hole
[2:06:50] <%holydeviant1> I am 90% sure that the peaceful inhabitants line is her experience with them, because they all simp for her
[2:06:51] <+TheFrancix> HOMEWARD BONE
[2:06:53] <%hiswill98> Why can‚Äôt I see my channel points?
[2:07:03] <dai_tonight> I don't think they actually care about NFTs, they're probably being gifted to them by the weirdos behind the whole NFT conglomerate
[2:07:08] <velgaduere> bruh
[2:07:09] <+ReallyBigRocks> ledge guy LUL
[2:07:10] <dai_tonight> To promote them etc
[2:07:10] <agustorm123> Toxique is quite strong
[2:07:11] <@Solidus_113> about 20k for a level
[2:07:11] <%hax_metatron> DEAD
[2:07:12] <youngking_kush> @ironohki The Gods just put all the shi5 they didnt like in here
[2:07:14] <+FuqBoiSlim> For the Gorillaz, I think it was the label on some BS and did things without Damon Albarn knowing
[2:07:19] <LoreKeeper_Thal> LUL
[2:07:19] <Admiral_PopnFresh> nice reggie
[2:07:23] <andre11dr> @hiswill98 click on it?
[2:07:23] <derap41> This place probably has the most souls per square inch
[2:07:25] <peachy996> they'll grow out of the NFT thing sooner or later
[2:07:30] <b_ikki> every time you pause the game spawns a zombie trust me
[2:07:30] <gespenstkick> Noice
[2:07:30] <%hax_metatron> Kindle
[2:07:36] <%IronOhki> @youngking_kush Legit, but it seemed like an oddly specific thing.
[2:07:37] <Treasure_Vault> Kindle to 15 and fireball?
[2:07:41] <Vigogs> did reggie get the Remedy sorcery?
[2:07:44] <+profanityincluded> homeward is autosit
[2:07:45] <dai_tonight> no, it's the bonfire
[2:07:45] <gespenstkick> it counts as sitting
[2:07:47] <%AbnormalVoid> Pyromancy nullifies the toxicity of the toxic enemies
[2:07:48] <peachy996> Last I heard Gorillaz were just trucking along with new music anyways
[2:07:50] <%hiswill98> @andre11dr no I mean, the channel points icon is completely gone for me
[2:07:53] <velgaduere> or just
[2:07:54] <rekinom> (that's wrong)
[2:07:55] <velgaduere> kill 2 dudes
[2:07:56] <%Juriasu> yeah this bonfire is a kindle
[2:07:57] <derap41> Good way to not die I guess
[2:08:00] <andre11dr> Get that Chaos fireball back
[2:08:00] <%IronOhki> @AbnormalVoid Woolie knows, he's letting Reggie figure it out.
[2:08:05] <dai_tonight> equip fireball
[2:08:13] <gryffinp> it WOULD be kinda interesting if homeward took you To the bonefire but did not in itself act as a reset
[2:08:14] <%IronOhki> Woolie gave a bit of a hint about fire.
[2:08:19] <%SarcFa> bone equals sit in DS1, DS3 it doesn't
[2:08:19] <%AbnormalVoid> @AbnormalVoid he's said things that actively contradict that
[2:08:21] <%Indigo_Automaton> Attune?
[2:08:21] <PunkZedB> it restores your estus so it probably calls the same function as sitting
[2:08:25] <QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus It's true in later games but not here I think
[2:08:26] <Treasure_Vault> Fireball and kindle, if you'd like.
[2:08:26] <sundizzle> would be a good time to kindle
[2:08:29] <andre11dr> @hiswill98 Have you tried refreshing the page?
[2:08:45] <youngking_kush> Issa miracle
[2:08:45] <SQDizzy> it just works
[2:08:47] <dai_tonight> um woolie tell him to kindle
[2:08:49] <%X2Eliah> yeah resonance is weird
[2:08:53] <+Sir_Louis> miracle resonance is funky
[2:08:55] <derap41> @dai_tonight Shush
[2:09:03] <%X2Eliah> like bloodstains
[2:09:04] <%hiswill98> @andre11dr oh there it is, thanks
[2:09:05] <tolloponik> even playing a faith build you can't use it
[2:09:09] <yukichocomilk> wtf I never knew that
[2:09:11] <%ThePich> barely buff
[2:09:11] <Zooperton> it's pretty wacky
[2:09:12] <FrostedZaibatsu> What? i never hear of that
[2:09:15] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> huh
[2:09:18] <dai_tonight> @derap41 Ok, "suggest him" to kindle then
[2:09:18] <LeeOhX> that's wild
[2:09:18] <andre11dr> Barely
[2:09:20] <JetpackMcQuack> never figured out what those were
[2:09:22] <QueequegTheater> And then they nerfed miracles
[2:09:22] <Treasure_Vault> dark souls is so deep for no reason
[2:09:22] <+Sir_Louis> its super rare and basically broken
[2:09:23] <%X2Eliah> the problem is, the miracles must match
[2:09:23] <derap41> Yeah that system barely works but it was a cool idea
[2:09:24] <haitakaa> LUL I don't think i've ever done a faith build
[2:09:24] <oak120> Its a weird littl thing
[2:09:29] <noxeturna> I hope Reggie sees a vagrant at some point
[2:09:30] <Johannen> I was so confused on my first playthrou as a faith knight
[2:09:31] <andre11dr> It not that useful
[2:09:33] <justcallmebobplease> Yeah, it's great in farming spots where miracles are useful, as people regularly drop them, so you get buffed, so you drop them...
[2:09:34] <%X2Eliah> like a Heal only buffs other >Heals
[2:09:35] <tolloponik> even surrounded by 10 the buff is pointless
[2:09:40] <LVL1_Scumbag> I should really try a faith build at some point
[2:09:40] <%Ensign_Epic> residence was one of the most broken systems they added to the game. for a decent amount of its life pretty much every resident sign appeared in the same place in the gank woods
[2:09:40] <%linSP> The white rings are OP
[2:09:43] <+Bitscreed> Miracle resonance is super weird. I never noticed any discernable bonus flinging miracles near them on my Faith build.
[2:09:44] <%holydeviant1> Oh, and the crew that Haircut is in? It makes them pop up more.
[2:09:50] <agustorm123> CACAW
[2:09:51] <Zooperton> DS1 has a bunch of weird multiplayer mechanics like that
[2:09:52] <vnzuelandude> CAW CAW
[2:09:52] <youngking_kush> He doesnt have to come up here
[2:09:52] <%Ensign_Epic> resonance not residence, but yeah
[2:09:53] <Duskendawn> Too rare to be useful really
[2:09:54] <urkleturtle> pvp hotspots used to be full of those things because of the wrath of god spam
[2:09:56] <derap41> GOTTEM
[2:09:57] <PunkZedB> RIGHT DOWN THE ROAD
[2:09:59] <Zooperton> I wish the other games had stuff like that
[2:10:02] <%waltzqueen> FORGOT ABOUT DRE
[2:10:02] <agustorm123> Now this is a match
[2:10:05] <derap41> Stepped right into it

[2:19:18] <dai_tonight> so what do we think, is he gonna attack the boss or just leave?
[2:19:22] <haitakaa> does he have a book of the guilty?
[2:19:25] <gryffinp> they never really figured out how to make the blue covenant work satisfyingly but it always has the best flavor
[2:19:30] <%X2Eliah> @dai_tonight need tail
[2:19:33] <@Solidus_113> @dai_tonight that'll be a bet
[2:19:34] <%fat_burtreynolds> Plague lyfe for life!
[2:19:35] <+Pinkiefan> That sword enchant magic is the best though
[2:19:43] <derap41> Sword dance would be cool here
[2:19:44] <+VforValensa> @andre11dr it totally does ive been doing pvp in the covenant all week

[2:20:22] <%fat_burtreynolds> Dooode. Remedy that shit
[2:20:24] <double_zr_tap> test it
[2:20:25] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus I've never actually tried. It's worth a shot.
[2:20:30] <%fat_burtreynolds> It foes
[2:20:31] <+Invidisible> Invidisible subscribed with Prime. 
[2:20:32] <andre11dr> @vforvalensa You're really getting summoned as a blue during invasions?
[2:20:32] <dai_tonight> well, poison and toxic are two different things
[2:20:33] <+Incsony> YOU KNOW WOOLIE
[2:20:38] <derap41> All this time
[2:20:42] <NireFuster> Oh snap I just got here, he's already on the painting?
[2:20:43] <dai_tonight> it's like using poison powder vs toxic in pokemon
[2:20:47] <Omentus> it does cure toxic
[2:20:50] <+VforValensa> @andre11dr yes
[2:20:53] <pennykettle_> Shoutout to the guy kindling bonfires whenever Reggie gets to that area
[2:20:53] <dai_tonight> @NireFuster Died to the archers, went back down.
[2:20:54] <derap41> INvasion 99% likely to happen
[2:20:57] <fruit_pie_the_magician> use a dung pie to find out
[2:20:59] <gespenstkick> Human boar
[2:21:01] <%Artoo__The_Me> Just came back did Reggie see üõ° yet?
[2:21:06] <NireFuster> @dai_tonight lol, nice, damn he progressed so much since last session!
[2:21:13] <%CommanderSqueaks> 15 sips
[2:21:14] <NireFuster> Last I remember he was still on blighttown?
[2:21:15] <+anoldtoilet> and you can spend more humanity to get 15 or 20 right?
[2:21:21] <LoreKeeper_Thal> 15 sips is nice
[2:21:21] <Treasure_Vault> YES
[2:21:21] <%cobalt_phoenix_> chat i missed like 10 min what happened
[2:21:24] <DudeDern> Is this the streamer who died to pinwheel?
[2:21:25] <derap41> 17 humanity is plenty
[2:21:27] <@Solidus_113> more sips never bad
[2:21:31] <Treasure_Vault> 15 sips is good
[2:21:31] <a_mad_dragon_> you have TONS
[2:21:33] <+Incsony> is this dark souls number 1?
[2:21:33] <%X2Eliah> @cobalt_phoenix_ toxic + caw
[2:21:34] <+VforValensa> i put the ring on while im grinding and get called into dark londo
[2:21:34] <haitakaa> no reason not to
[2:21:35] <pennykettle_> hell, why not 20
[2:21:36] <andre11dr> @vforvalensa Welp ,i did plenty of invasions back in the day and never saw ablue
[2:21:36] <dai_tonight> @DudeDern That's pat.
[2:21:37] <noxeturna> Be wary of invasion. Kindle fast or you may lose your ability to sit
[2:21:38] <Xaeveax> Holding onto humanity doesn't help much, especially later in the game/DLC
[2:21:43] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @cobalt_phoenix_ any items or spells?
[2:21:44] <haitakaa> you can always get more humanity easily
[2:21:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> 15 sips maybe
[2:21:56] <%fat_burtreynolds> It‚Äôs a long zone dude
[2:21:57] <%Ensign_Epic> he wants 20
[2:21:59] <%fat_burtreynolds> Worth it
[2:22:04] <pennykettle_> If I ever kindle past 10 I just go full 20
[2:22:08] <%RyTYoung> You're gonna need it Kappa
[2:22:15] <andre11dr> In DS3 it works better, infact maybe it works a little to much
[2:22:18] <Iniudan> Would take 20 on this one. This zone suck and invasion is assured if you are human. =p
[2:22:19] <+vaderxyz1970> Do do do doo doo do do do " He Needed It"
[2:22:22] <derap41> We've already cleared a third its fine
[2:22:23] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I mean half the enemies in this area do toxic
[2:22:34] <+Incsony> is this his first run at DS?
[2:22:35] <%X2Eliah> 20 seems a bit much tho
[2:22:35] <%CaptainBeird> the king spawns in the graveyard so no worries about invasion yet
[2:22:42] <dai_tonight> wait why is invasion so certain here? i never play as a human lol
[2:22:46] <+quintonomo> nice rolls
[2:22:48] <+alphonseisbest> @Incsony ye
[2:22:49] <pennykettle_> @dai_tonight npc one is here
[2:22:53] <+Pinkiefan> I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever kindled to 20.
[2:22:53] <Quack_of_Dawn> After 3 20 feels excessive intinctually
[2:22:54] <dai_tonight> oh
[2:22:56] <+quintonomo> getting outta that toxic
[2:22:59] <NireFuster> @dai_tonight not sure but even on PTDE I get invaded a lot here
[2:23:03] <pennykettle_> so guaranteed invasion @dai_tonight
[2:23:03] <+quintonomo> the difference is the torch!
[2:23:06] <%fat_burtreynolds> Moar like stupid ass hackers be invading here :/
[2:23:12] <+warlockwithapixie> I hope he sees the king.
[2:23:12] <andre11dr> Ok ,so WHY THE FUCK CAN'T I INVADE HIM?
[2:23:14] <%ThePich> reggie pls there's no need to go up there all the time
[2:23:18] <derap41> @dai_tonight Well maybe not so much anymore but this was a prime pvp spot before DLC
[2:23:20] <andre11dr> This is PC right?
[2:23:26] <+alphonseisbest> @andre11dr ehehehehehehe LUL
[2:23:32] <dai_tonight> @andre11dr Steam yeah

[2:23:37] <%Artoo__The_Me> @andre11dr Get watchdogged
[2:23:40] <NireFuster> CAW
[2:23:42] <Duskendawn> Watchdog mod prevents invasions I think
[2:23:43] <%CaptainBeird> @andre11dr they're running watchdog
[2:23:57] <+robertoszek> Velka outdid herself with the crow booty
[2:23:58] <andre11dr> That's not how watchdog works
[2:24:01] <@Menitta> lmao people trying to invade
[2:24:07] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus If it's more damage you're looking for, you could always two-hand that nuke
[2:24:08] <dai_tonight> sticc
[2:24:08] <%X2Eliah> LUL wannabe stream snipers salty in chat
[2:24:09] <%hax_metatron> Souvenir get
[2:24:10] <pennykettle_> I thought Woolie had a button to kick invaders, not a block altogether
[2:24:11] <NireFuster> crow booty
[2:24:13] <andre11dr> It's dosen't stop invasions
[2:24:14] <+Incsony> ncie nice
[2:24:15] <derap41> another one
[2:24:16] <%Ensign_Epic> yeah they're running watchdog in the settings that the guy who actually runs watchdog took down
[2:24:17] <%CaptainBeird> @andre11dr maybe level difference?
[2:24:19] <kikoeru_san> oh Reggie's in hell now, still has that fuck boar on his head
[2:24:23] <Duskendawn> Idk I don't play souls on pc
[2:24:30] <pennykettle_> Yea I thought so
[2:24:31] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:24:33] <%Ensign_Epic> I'm directly in his invasion range and have been for the past few streams and haven't gotten him
[2:24:39] <dai_tonight> oh nice
[2:24:40] <DudeDern> Has reggie gotten grabbed by any of the birds yet?
[2:24:41] <gryffinp> Yeah but has anyone actually invaded even once
[2:24:42] <+Jiggisnipe> like Farkus
[2:24:42] <NireFuster> That's pretty nice
[2:24:43] <andre11dr> See
[2:24:44] <velgaduere> lobosS
[2:24:46] <AzaroRequiem> did Reggie get Lautrec'd yet?
[2:24:47] <derap41> Like Farkus
[2:24:49] <%cobalt_phoenix_> like a fake tarkus
[2:24:51] <%Artoo__The_Me> woolieGASM
[2:24:51] <GHouseduivel> LUL
[2:24:51] <derap41> but that guy was cool
[2:24:52] <pennykettle_> He's not human enough for many invasions
[2:24:54] <slix3431> WELCOME TO ANOR LONDO
[2:24:57] <+VforValensa> isnt this zone locked from online tho
[2:24:58] <Demoli_PT> thats a shame, we need more Farkus moments
[2:25:00] <+Incsony> why not play it on console?
[2:25:02] <GHouseduivel> Bird Up
[2:25:02] <%Lion_kun> Why was Farkus unwelcome? He was awesome.
[2:25:06] <+robertoszek> @Ensign_Epic can the watchdog change the default range?
[2:25:10] <%Artoo__The_Me> Perked up too Kappa
[2:25:11] <Duskendawn> Farkus was summoned, not invader
[2:25:16] <gespenstkick> 2low
[2:25:17] <derap41> that is correct
[2:25:19] <oak120> d e d
[2:25:20] <dai_tonight> @Incsony Woolie is mostly a pc gamer
[2:25:23] <peachy996> get toxified
[2:25:25] <gryffinp> like at this point with woolie's long history of technical foibles I am more willing to believe that woolie has it set to no invasions ever by accident
[2:25:27] <Iniudan> @AzaroRequiem, nope he not even pass the archer yet in Londo
[2:25:33] <dai_tonight> well he plays on everything really but his platform of choice is pc

[2:26:13] <wqorst> nailed it
[2:26:17] <NireFuster> I never thought about using magic as a utility tool rather than main offense slash defense otpions
[2:26:17] <%fat_burtreynolds> The truest use of magic ever
[2:26:21] <Quack_of_Dawn> Oh I just remembered the friends underground in this zone :)
[2:26:22] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh no he's going for full clears every time isn't he
[2:26:23] <peachy996> dont worry you can't get toxic'd more than once in this area
[2:26:24] <PunkZedB> utility magic best magic

[2:26:35] <peachy996> K A P P A
[2:26:37] <andre11dr> Wait didn't Remaster add some bullshit where you both need the same weapon level to connect

[2:27:29] <%hax_metatron> Remaster has weapon level matching, but Reggie already got Black Knight weapons and unique weapons, so he should theoretically be able to match with anyone.

[2:27:52] <noxeturna> some people just don't want to be bothered. For me, if I see someone else has cooler shit than me, it's extra motivation to go find out how to get it myself
[2:27:52] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> they have specific areas they'll attack you in
[2:27:58] <DudeDern> How do birds get so much poise? They should be light not heavy
[2:27:59] <%Ensign_Epic> I mean, not the end of the world, I'm getting all of you guys who were trying to invade and killing you
[2:28:09] <%Seancicle> üò±

[2:28:14] <%CaptainBeird> reggie turning german
[2:28:23] <~WoolieVersus> @brunoberserk I do, you just haven't been here for when it ruins the session. We're still invadable now anyway.

[2:28:27] <andre11dr> @dudedern Dat ass ,has 100 poise
[2:28:32] <DudeDern> I wish I was a swole ass bird
[2:28:54] <zanzibarian_hamster> Does fire just make these guys instantly pop or am I having a mandela/stupid moment?
[2:29:10] <%MrMoonGoose> Kindling here was wise.
[2:29:16] <pennykettle_> Theres a big difference between LPing a game and just playing it. invasions can ruin an LP
[2:29:19] <+athuramn> get replied on LUL
[2:29:23] <derap41> LUL

[2:29:31] <%Artoo__The_Me> New zone! woolieYE
[2:29:31] <+supertyleo> fire nullifies the toxic
[2:29:34] <warpiscute> @zanzibarian_hamster it doesn't make them instantly pop, but it will stop their pop from inflicting toxic on you

[2:33:40] <andre11dr> Reggie is a gender fluid boar
[2:33:45] <GHouseduivel> @derap41 I meant isn't that a braid, and not a ponytail?
[2:33:45] <ClimbingClifford> I love that half the time while you play the game it's just "Fashion Souls"
[2:33:45] <NireFuster> let him try outfits chat come on now LUL trying out new outfits is part of the experience
[2:33:46] <LeeOhX> Reggie looks like druid
[2:33:51] <%BisoromiBear> make a necklace out of bird lady skulls to complete the fit
[2:33:52] <%hax_metatron> Knight Shaman is pretty much your build Reggie, so it fits.
[2:33:54] <AzaroRequiem> he actually looks like a weird NPC you could run into at some point
[2:33:57] <+Shady_Zaku> @thepich oh, I see he just likes it that's fair. Personally I don't at all but, not my playthrough is it lol

[2:36:09] <dalmek> @andre11dr they're at the top of the pecking order
[2:36:14] <NireFuster> Oh yeah this is like one of the very first areas they designed when making the game
[2:36:14] <%CommanderSqueaks> @linSP I prefer NNNN barrAyy
[2:36:18] <haitakaa> The Black Priest robes are cool for a Bleach cosplay build
[2:36:18] <%waltzqueen> @dalmek CLAP

[2:36:41] <kinkade_77> remaster is alot nicer looking than i remember
[2:36:48] <%IronOhki> Wasn't the boss of this zone originally going to be the protagonist?
[2:36:51] <+patel347> Vertical Slice
[2:36:53] <pennykettle_> It was the first level they designed, and its one of the top 10 levels
[2:36:53] <%mr_sups> A Vertical Slice?
[2:36:53] <%Cozy90> Nito used to be here
[2:36:55] <derap41> I wish the entire game was this intricate'
[2:36:56] <michlarv> why fight all these enemies every time?
[2:36:57] <%KellBeII> think nito was originally supposed to be the boss here too
[2:36:58] <%fetrigon> Reggie...
[2:37:00] <gryffinp> Is woolie humoring that chat guy?

[2:37:05] <%Seancicle> üõÇ
[2:37:10] <wantedsafe471> Yeah, its very demons souls. one bonfire and multiple shortcuts
[2:37:11] <agustorm123> is really compact place too
[2:37:14] <+Shady_Zaku> Footsies game off on that one doodScrub
[2:37:18] <%hax_metatron> It‚Äôs a Demon‚Äôs Souls reference for that exact reason
[2:37:21] <%KeiganOfAstora> It's in the Design Works interview, they talk about it a lot
[2:37:22] <%Ensign_Epic> @ironohki yes, she was meant to be the female deuteragonist
[2:37:24] <+athuramn> try kiting Oo
[2:37:26] <+patel347> I love that toxic is part of the vertical slice
[2:37:31] <pennykettle_> I think Nito was the boss, and Priscilla was originally the firelink shrine firekeeper??
[2:37:41] <%waltzqueen> @patel347 gotta get that bullshit in early
[2:37:42] <%KellBeII> something like that yeaah

[3:03:10] <Carlioo> reggie won that virtua fighter match legit, come on
[3:03:11] <trench2nowhere> Reggie pulled a Patches
[3:03:13] <+eanscrale> Is there an equivalent for the term "johns" for cheap wins?

[3:03:16] <oak120> That Bonfire looking brilliant
[3:03:16] <+capybruhArt> "you won the money match?", "I won it all, Jerry!!"
[3:03:20] <+twohitgood> Jerry full screen super'd and got punished for it.
[3:03:21] <peachy996> Jerry threw his money in your face and walked aay, forfeiting the set
[3:03:22] <%RemedyofRevenge> Just to clarify, the Xantheous set spawns near the boss area chat
[3:03:25] <QueequegTheater> @eanscrale we take those
[3:03:34] <derap41> @RemedyofRevenge But the whip
[3:03:49] <%Finnmac5> How does it feel to be the very thing you swore to destroy, how does it feel to become patches?
[3:03:52] <+twohitgood> the fire whip would be what Jerry drops from the invasion.
[3:03:53] <Duskendawn> Yeah set spawns after boss, by exit
[3:03:55] <velgaduere> Moron Jerry is right
[3:03:55] <Awesome_Leaf> moron jerry D:
[3:03:57] <%RemedyofRevenge> @RemedyofRevenge that is a sad part, but we will hopefully set that at firelink
[3:03:58] <Treasure_Vault> There's always a Cheat Engine fix
[3:04:02] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> don't call him a moron that's mean Woolie
[3:04:04] <agustorm123> Fire Whip is awesome
[3:04:24] <noxeturna> Isn't his stuff just at the top of that one staircase?
[3:04:36] <QueequegTheater> @noxeturna not when he falls off
[3:04:39] <Equirah> yeah, it's at the end of the zone
[3:04:44] <%hax_metatron> Jeremiah doesn‚Äôt drop anything AFAIK other than humanity and Souls. His set is in a different spot.
[3:04:44] <@Solidus_113> he has all the chaos versions
[3:04:48] <%BisoromiBear> Thomas is the undisputed lord of pyromancers now
[3:04:57] <dai_tonight> why is reggie going this way
[3:04:57] <LunarRemix> Thomas is a monster
[3:04:59] <noxeturna> @QueequegTheater I thought when you reload it just goes to where the npc initially spawns
[3:05:16] <wantedsafe471> Troll spell
[3:05:19] <velgaduere> scraping spear is that you?

[3:05:27] <agustorm123> The fuck you spell
[3:05:27] <QueequegTheater> @noxeturna usually it does.  If it bugs out, it usually defaults to the chest behind Frampt
[3:05:29] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus This spell only works on other players, and it barely works at all
[3:05:38] <missile9000> How long have we been rocking the catch-pole? New to the manga
[3:05:44] <Duskendawn> Elaine shows up to laugh
[3:05:45] <NireFuster> @missile9000 Since Blighttown I think
[3:05:47] <%BisoromiBear> It only works if you invade someone who's afk
[3:05:52] <BurdRightsActivist> hey, just in case you need to know and because I didn't see anyone say it, but the set spawns after the boss. Just so you know :)

[3:08:03] <missile9000> Hedgehogs do burst damage, bonewheels are more consistent
[3:08:05] <QueequegTheater> @Lion_kun Hedgehogs do damage on contact, it's not even close
[3:08:07] <+Pinkiefan> What are hedgehogs?
[3:08:09] <%fat_burtreynolds> Wheelin Dealing! Lemony stickin. WOOO

[3:08:35] <Xaeveax> Wait what, I never saw that
[3:08:36] <derap41> This is what you need to progress
[3:08:42] <QueequegTheater> @Pinkiefan Ice hedgehogs that do the same thing, but also you take damage by being near them
[3:08:46] <missile9000> Monkey island type bullshit
[3:08:46] <pochecito> That's mean
[3:08:48] <dai_tonight> the what
[3:08:49] <derap41> how was anyone suppose to find that
[3:08:50] <%TheOddJik> oh WOW i missed that on my playhtough. That explains so much

[3:09:04] <%waltzqueen> Welka the best
[3:09:07] <DSD24> Here we go
[3:09:09] <Xaeveax> I always thought you had to just jump down
[3:09:18] <+warlockwithapixie> An invader was super nice and activated it for m my first time through.
[3:09:18] <Zooperton> was that a dark souls reference
[3:09:23] <missile9000> This is cool and all, but nothing beats jump attacking the dragon butt
[3:09:25] <+foomaster22> Wow can't believe DS1 references DS3 Kappa
[3:09:29] <%thotbane> What if Velkas child is patches
[3:09:33] <velgaduere> early illusory walls
[3:09:34] <LimitBreak_J> anyone elses sound messed up?
[3:09:39] <+profanityincluded> LUL
[3:09:46] <dai_tonight> use the shiny stone reggie
[3:09:53] <agustorm123> And he fat rolls
[3:09:58] <%scrumbotime> Wow he actually was able to block the whole roll
[3:10:03] <andre11dr> Yeah, this place is an actual labyrinth
[3:10:05] <Teras_ode> the jump down is a glitch route because it requires you to use the jump attack glitch on the dragon ass
[3:10:11] <%Dakuu75> I bet Elden Ring will have wheel skeletons but, they'll actually collide and damage each other
[3:10:12] <%Lion_kun> I thought the roll was infinite
[3:10:16] <Duskendawn> Reg never learned not to block them huh
[3:10:17] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus So I'm gonna go ahead and say that a high-stability shield will make a big difference here. Balder is probably the highest you've got.
[3:10:17] <derap41> @scrumbotime pretty sure these boys got nerfed in the remaster
[3:10:31] <nichijoutaro> nice helmet

[3:27:03] <%AbnormalVoid> it SUCKS
[3:27:09] <+Shady_Zaku> @dai_tonight Usually Depends on the setting/ability of the caster or the spell if it needs verbal components

[3:27:50] <noxeturna> @dai_tonight In D&D terms, spells can have Verbal, Somatic (hand movements), and Material components. Silence nullifies anything with a Verbal component, but video games usually just assume all spells are verbal

[3:32:58] <+Shishi1205> V
[3:32:59] <%A_German_spy> @QueequegTheater No evidence whatsoever. There's actually more evidence suggesting that Velka just peaced out along with the rest of the gods when they left Anor Londo.
[3:33:00] <%cobalt_phoenix_> can you magic weapon it?
[3:33:03] <NireFuster> We dex now? let's goooo

[3:33:21] <velgaduere> @A_German_spy is there any evidence that Velka was an inhabitant of AL?
[3:33:24] <derap41> that 2HR2 is so cool
[3:33:26] <BurdRightsActivist> it's a big V

[3:33:28] <dai_tonight> what's with the X? which one of reggie's stats doesn't meet the requirement?
[3:33:30] <SethYuikora> BREAKDOWN
[3:33:32] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus The fact that Velka still has servants, and prayers to her still get answered, suggest that she's very much alive
[3:33:33] <+2Vibe2Check> It does a V for Velka PogChamp
[3:33:36] <%X2Eliah> dex
[3:33:36] <+pectusumbra> could be a fun 2nd weapon in the pocket
[3:33:36] <Teras_ode> V for Velka
[3:33:37] <+Shishi1205> @dai_tonight dex
[3:33:39] <%waltzqueen> there's nothing to suggest it but i like to think Velka is actually just chilling out there, somewhere laughing at Gwyn with peanuts
[3:33:41] <NireFuster> EEYAH!
[3:33:45] <tolloponik> it's a Saber rapier
[3:33:48] <%AbnormalVoid> the V makes it a pain in the ass to hit shit
[3:33:48] <dai_tonight> got it
[3:33:50] <+Shishi1205> 12 14 16
[3:33:54] <MinersLoveGames> depends on the rapier. Needle-point blades are the stabby kind. The more flat, general-shaped blades can cut and stab.
[3:33:57] <%X2Eliah> basically evens
[3:34:00] <derap41> 16 covers almost all dex
[3:34:05] <%cobalt_phoenix_> or even 50
[3:34:06] <youngking_kush> I like the theory Velka is the bird at Firelink
[3:34:13] <justcallmebobplease> How about TWENTY-FUCKING-FOUR (24) dex req?
[3:34:15] <%Seancicle> oui
[3:34:16] <%linSP> 99 dex
[3:34:18] <QueequegTheater> @A_German_spy I always got the sense that Velka was on a separate level from the """gods""", in that Gwyn & Co are killable but Velka seems like the personification of Sin/Punishment (more like a Greek god than a Norse one)
[3:34:18] <+Shishi1205> 50 for str is not that unusual
[3:34:19] <%pennykettle_> Wait was there a reason for the gods leaving AL or is it a mystery? Feels spooky
[3:34:20] <+anoldtoilet> velka isnt the bird but that bird 100% works for velka
[3:34:23] <andre11dr> There's a 50 dex weapon in DS3
[3:34:26] <glass_marcus> 24 for that one boss weapon was not worth it
[3:34:27] <gespenstkick> EG: 22 str to two-hand black knight halberd
[3:34:27] <velgaduere> @youngking_kush Velka do be wantin to mess with Gwyn's machinations tho
[3:34:30] <%Javaa01> 20 req weapons are for hyper specific builds
[3:34:34] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Rapier do have a cutting edge but in reality you wouldnt realy use it
[3:34:36] <Quack_of_Dawn> @andre11dr Ducken darkdrift
[3:34:44] <haitakaa> on subsequent playthroughs you can pick out a weapon early on and build towards it
[3:34:46] <velgaduere> @pennykettle_ fear of the Age of Dark, as the fire was fading
[3:34:46] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:34:48] <dai_tonight> did reggie get velka's set alrady? I might have missed that
[3:34:48] <+buttdirt> wanted to use demon's greataxe once, 46 str requirement, freakin insane
[3:34:50] <%A_German_spy> @velgaduere There's no clear information on that one way or the other, no. But since most of the references to her are found in the Painted World, which is in Anor Londo, then it's at least feasible that she was.
[3:34:51] <%megaman_sentinel> Grant 50str/30faith
[3:34:52] <Teras_ode> so are the enemies in this area explicitly using the DeS version of the fire spells since they behave like 'arrows' and not like 'grenades' as pyromancies do?
[3:34:55] <+pectusumbra> was there an item up the4re?
[3:35:03] <agustorm123> time to fight dragon

[3:35:27] <yukichocomilk> LEATHER DADDY
[3:35:28] <+Shishi1205> it is
[3:35:28] <%AbnormalVoid> Velka has to straight up be a Dark god, and considering the "first sin" it makes sense that she'd be a god of punishment

[3:45:04] <LunarRemix> Try the Lighting Spear
[3:45:04] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus That wasn't the forward R2

[3:45:40] <%SarcFa> Reggie's just not getting the right input timing it seems
[3:45:46] <%KeiganOfAstora> mace
[3:45:47] <+Shishi1205> Jump r2 is universal
[3:45:47] <dai_tonight> If they intended for this to happen, why didn't they give the legs some proper standing up animation?
[3:45:49] <%KeiganOfAstora> They all do
[3:45:50] <Pie_Mastyr> so I think this happens because jump attacks trigger the grab flag, like plunging attacks which resets the animation on the legs

[3:46:36] <+Suneater_Jerome> nvm comment right above mine said it lmao
[3:46:38] <%andrewofbob> It's undead, it's fine
[3:46:38] <Teras_ode> this is a non intentional route, since you need to glitch it
[3:46:40] <dai_tonight> it's so gross :(
[3:46:42] <marcdyllan> DIGNITY
[3:46:44] <%bruuzer12> @suneater_jerome they're playing the remaster, so yes
[3:46:45] <NireFuster> LUL they never fixed it
[3:46:48] <wantedsafe471> Thanks Qloc for leaving the glitches in. Instead fixng the game
[3:46:53] <dan_g_v> since the plunge attack is basically a jump attack, the jump attack triggers special animations on many NPC's
[3:46:53] <derap41> You can skip the well which is nice
[3:46:53] <+Shishi1205> @WoolieVersus Zulie has a video about it. Turns out jump attacks have some grab like properties
[3:46:57] <+ReallyBigRocks> just don't eat shit
[3:47:05] <%pennykettle_> I WISH that were the last time
[3:47:07] <wqorst> unfortunately?
[3:47:12] <%Rafraud> YESSSIIIIIRRRRRR
[3:47:12] <Johannen> I thought they removed all the dragon butts
[3:47:12] <PunkZedB> subtle forshadowing
[3:47:12] <DSD24> The bone lords
[3:47:13] <andre11dr> They shouldn't fix it ,it's kinda part of the game at this point
[3:47:13] <+profanityincluded> thank GOD you mean
[3:47:15] <+Pinkiefan> Feather fall is a good spell
[3:47:20] <%vVAstrAVv> UGH LOL izalith

[3:49:08] <%Mathochism> gentlemen even
[3:49:14] <%Dopamien> also fucks with kaathe if I recall
[3:49:20] <%pennykettle_> I think jump attacks put any NPC into their default pose? I think you can make Andre stand up if you do it without aggroing him
[3:49:22] <DSD24> The moment their heart breaks in half
[3:49:26] <SethYuikora> that's one kindled fire
[3:49:30] <dalmek> I like to think they're all holding hands, with those weird arms sticking outta their backs
[3:49:31] <+Shishi1205> @Dopamien correct
[3:49:37] <%X2Eliah> Phalanx doesnt get "agggressive", Phalanx gets "intrigued"
[3:49:39] <derap41> Today comes the true test of Reggies mettle
[3:49:39] <+Bitscreed> Grab property eh? So Zangief could get past that dragon butt really easy then.
[3:49:41] <%andrewofbob> Nobody likes chaos phalanx
[3:49:43] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Picked up Bloodshield
[3:49:54] <wantedsafe471> Wonder how people who played the game recognized those guys from DeS?
[3:50:00] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Reggie's gonna be stocked on levels for the rest of Anor Londo
[3:50:01] <SethYuikora> kill a phalanx
[3:50:02] <QueequegTheater> Why not just use them all
[3:50:14] <%Prevot> why can't they just tell you how many souls its worth
[3:50:15] <+anoldtoilet> what if you need them for later Kappa
[3:50:25] <dundore77> Pullo formation
[3:50:31] <%CaptainBeird> did reggie read the red sign soapstone?
[3:50:34] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @prevot there's a mod for that
[3:50:36] <+Bitscreed> Now I want to see Zangief spinning piledriver a dragon butt
[3:50:42] <SethYuikora> fireball
[3:50:43] <LunarRemix> Like a Great Chaos Fireball
[3:50:44] <@Solidus_113> 500 souls each
[3:50:44] <wantedsafe471> THE best farm
[3:50:46] <available_line> Phalanx is the best farm
[3:50:51] <@Solidus_113> the chaos fireball is good
[3:50:51] <Johannen> Chaos Fireball also is great
[3:50:55] <Teras_ode> or fire storm
[3:50:57] <+pectusumbra> I imagine chaos fireball yeah
[3:50:57] <derap41> Firestorm too
[3:50:59] <dundore77> Edo Tensai

[3:51:04] <Duskendawn> Mind went to pat's dog doing piledriver
[3:51:04] <+anoldtoilet> yeah chaos fireball is perfect
[3:51:06] <derap41> Gravelord dance was my favorite
[3:51:07] <tolloponik> all mighty PUSH!
[3:51:09] <$genocidal_cupcake> Almighty Push\
[3:51:09] <available_line> chaos firestorm or whaetver, one shots phalanx
[3:51:09] <KaiserMario> Shinra Tensei
[3:51:10] <%megaman_sentinel> almaight push
[3:51:11] <kikosmore> "great press" what in the world
[3:51:12] <wantedsafe471> Overkill with firestorm plus silver serpent ring is very fast
[3:51:14] <%vVAstrAVv> firestorms good too
[3:51:16] <fruit_pie_the_magician> chaos firestorm is good too
[3:51:16] <dundore77> wow botched that
[3:51:17] <youngking_kush> SHINRA TENSEI
[3:51:22] <+Shishi1205> @WoolieVersus There's the video, 2 moths old. about 2 minutes. Named: Is this shortcut intentional? /watch?v=5NHJpfYwhKs
[3:51:22] <%RemedyofRevenge> Helm of Avarice @WoolieVersus
[3:51:26] <andre11dr> Wrath Of God them works great
[3:51:29] <SethYuikora> or firestorm
[3:51:33] <%hax_metatron> Reggie at end game levels
[3:51:39] <ericbritsman> dex
[3:51:40] <Johannen> 10k sounds too little, i thought it was more
[3:51:42] <derap41> way faster than the woods too
[3:51:42] <andre11dr> Chaos Fireball is the other way, witch he has
[3:51:45] <justcallmebobplease> Chaos Firestorm's great too
[3:51:46] <tolloponik> was anyone else disappointed that Almighty Push wasn't a giant hand when you saw it
[3:51:46] <EternalPunishment> He's still here. lol
[3:51:49] <agustorm123> Reggie is big for these
[3:51:58] <%CapnClassix> Does mimic hat and covetous serpent ring stack?
[3:52:05] <LoreKeeper_Thal> @CapnClassix yes
[3:52:05] <%KeiganOfAstora> yup
[3:52:06] <+Pinkiefan> Did Woolie say what the plan is for dlc?  Are they finishing the game first or after?
[3:52:09] <Equirah> @CapnClassix yes
[3:52:09] <%bruuzer12> @capnclassix yup
[3:52:10] <wantedsafe471> i think so
[3:52:14] <SethYuikora> FUNNY YOU SHOULD ASK
[3:52:15] <%KeiganOfAstora> @Pinkiefan Whenever Reggie wants to
[3:52:18] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Another neat mechanic is that you actually get bonus souls if you "overkill" enemies with excessive damage
[3:52:20] <%hax_metatron> Yeah the concept of Pain's attacks was done WAY BETTER in Hunter x Hunter, with Netero.
[3:52:24] <b_ikki> smear in the ass DansGame
[3:52:25] <Treasure_Vault> @Pinkiefan I don't think there's an after in DS1
[3:52:31] <%pennykettle_> whaaaa @A_German_spy
[3:52:32] <Johannen> @Pinkiefan How would they finish the game first? it locks them out
[3:52:41] <gespenstkick> Fromsoft gonna Fromsoft
[3:52:56] <+Pinkiefan> I did it after on mine.
[3:52:56] <%A_German_spy> @pennykettle_ Yup. Try it. Kill an enemy with bare minimum damage, then kill it with damage equal to more than its max HP.

[3:54:13] <Darren716> The real boss of this zone
[3:54:13] <+Shishi1205> @WoolieVersus So just rewatched the jump attack video: The "bug" is related to the throw system which includes grabs, backstabs and ripostes (think about plunging attack vs the demon in the beginning).
[3:54:16] <urkleturtle> you can't backstab him, but you can parry him
[3:54:19] <%megaman_sentinel> no hes not
[3:54:28] <TigerClaws12> yea you can only parry, no riposte tho

[3:56:11] <derap41> Good to have
[3:56:11] <%pennykettle_> When you leave the Painted World make sure you listen to the cutscene so you can hear the CHEESY sound effect
[3:56:12] <+Shishi1205> It interrupts animations

[3:56:48] <OblivionSword1> it's not bad
[3:56:55] <QueequegTheater> No, instead debate for five minutes about it
[3:56:56] <dai_tonight> I see. More of a tower shield user myself.
[3:56:57] <DSD24> Shields are nice
[3:56:58] <+anoldtoilet> stability is the main stat you need to worry about for shields, then physical, then other defenses,
[3:56:59] <Make_me_mad> It's a good shield for not getting fucked up by status effects if you aren't expecting them/have a ring already on for it.
[3:57:00] <%brandt_connors> and weight
[3:57:00] <wantedsafe471> No, its useful if you want to use Priscila's  scythe
[3:57:02] <OblivionSword1> crest is still better
[3:57:02] <haitakaa> damn does he not have the grass crest shield?

[4:09:27] <KyberNasse> TALKING SHIT
[4:09:28] <%Ensign_Epic> that was depressing. and you deserve it for attacking fluffy tail
[4:09:30] <noxeturna> Today Reggie learns that taking the path of Lautrec is not what it's cut out to be.

[4:09:39] <Estuko> Mind you guys Reggie is learning a lot, the width of her feet, the length, depth of her soles, the count of her toes, his knowledge of feet is unmatched in combat.
[4:09:39] <derap41> Lots of utilities that could help lets see if he's smart
[4:09:39] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @peachy996 take it back
[4:09:41] <haitakaa> can't he still just jump off?
[4:09:42] <missile9000> Reggie if your not going to use your shield then grab your weapons with TWO HANDS
[4:09:42] <%SarcFa> to actually decloak her
[4:09:45] <+ItalianWaifu> I mean whats to stop you from just running past her off the edge
[4:09:46] <user_naim> @peachy996 ruin sentinels have a bop

[4:10:30] <derap41> Just invisible
[4:10:31] <+FlappySeal_> did you know, she won't die until she's dead?
[4:10:32] <dai_tonight> Weakness: Attacking

[4:10:37] <+Grayhammatter> just invisible
[4:10:40] <+Bitscreed> Attack her weak spot for massive damage
[4:10:40] <dai_tonight> UNLESS?
[4:10:40] <sirrice77> You could always see the ghosts though cursed or not?
[4:10:40] <%cobalt_phoenix_> unless?
[4:10:41] <andre11dr> Chaos fireball is the way Reggie
[4:10:41] <+2Vibe2Check> It's not true it's bullshit I did not hit her I did noot

[4:10:44] <b_ikki> üò≥
[4:10:45] <%A_German_spy> @Johannen Probably, but at least it's not a weapon he'd ever use.
[4:10:46] <%hax_metatron> Yeah break her poise
[4:10:51] <Texeu> 50K for Reggie to win
[4:10:52] <SainEdge> üò≥
[4:10:53] <Duskendawn> Reggie is playing us, he's actually buying time to admire feet
[4:10:54] <Zooperton> dag the faith in reggie in this chat

[4:10:57] <derap41> Sweep the room

[4:11:03] <%hax_metatron> R1 R1
[4:11:04] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Reggie, Acid Cloud will do nothing to PvE enemies
[4:11:08] <user_naim> 10k on ‚ÄùNo‚Äù just for the odds
[4:11:10] <%hax_metatron> R1 R1 Reggie
[4:11:10] <%jinking79> time for me to lose some points LUL
[4:11:11] <QueequegTheater> @Texeu Good, keep adding more so my payout is higher
[4:11:11] <royb2> the acid surge wont do jack tho
[4:11:12] <+anoldtoilet> swing TWICE
[4:11:14] <Johannen> @A_German_spy Didnt even knew that could happen
[4:11:15] <%hax_metatron> R1 TWICE
[4:11:16] <BionicPulga> rawrSip
[4:11:16] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @zooperton he's been killing it so far
[4:11:22] <%Wouldz> gamblor!
[4:11:23] <NireFuster> There we go
[4:11:23] <derap41> Clears the whole room
[4:11:25] <dai_tonight> Going with YES for an easy win.
[4:11:26] <@Solidus_113> 2nd swing of R1
[4:11:27] <%Rafraud> SWING TWICE LMAO
[4:11:29] <TheyCallMeVawn> Just R1 twice
[4:11:29] <NireFuster> Using them two hands now
[4:11:31] <%cobalt_phoenix_> isn't the follow up on r1 also a horizontal?
[4:11:32] <%Rafraud> REGGIE PLEASE
[4:11:33] <user_naim> Old Hunters OST has a lot of Gustav Holst vibes
[4:11:35] <QueequegTheater> GAMBA
[4:11:35] <%Rafraud> HELP
[4:11:39] <double_zr_tap> back step attacks are the same as roll attacks
[4:11:39] <Treasure_Vault> R1 R1
[4:11:42] <andre11dr> I'll take the YES Reggie has this
[4:11:43] <dai_tonight> wait why are we talkinga bout soul calibur again
[4:11:49] <%Rafraud> R1 R1
[4:11:51] <+ReallyBigRocks> Does the catch pole have a whiff animation?
[4:11:55] <atomizedstream> the follow up to the 1h r1 is horizontal
[4:11:55] <derap41> Mist is a good idea if it can land
[4:11:58] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @dai_tonight as a way to explain horizontal v verical swings
[4:11:59] <%CommanderSqueaks> @dai_tonight Because Reggie thinks in fighting games
[4:12:01] <+pectusumbra> chaos fireball! Warm up those toes with LAVA
[4:12:04] <%A_German_spy> @Johannen Well, you only get one shot at reclaiming an out-of-reach item by reloading
[4:12:06] <sirrice77> @dai_tonight To put it in terms reggie understands
[4:12:07] <Pie_Mastyr> blood shield and red moss also are good choices here
[4:12:08] <%infinitelymellow> @dai_tonight because it all relates dude
[4:12:10] <+supertyleo> back steps and running attacks
[4:12:12] <iinsectaa> Little peets
[4:12:14] <NumbF4ke> Don forget to check weapon
[4:12:14] <dai_tonight> Kill her with her sword, would be funny
[4:12:17] <missile9000> Reggie needs to be more aggressive and make more assumptions
[4:12:21] <dai_tonight> @infinitelymellow Can't argue with that
[4:12:29] <TheyCallMeVawn> Please just two hand Reggie
[4:12:33] <MeImoth> hmmm what this weapons dodge+R1 like?
[4:12:38] <Treasure_Vault> Did Reggie block once that fight?
[4:12:40] <missile9000> Oh yeah
[4:12:50] <Darren716> Reggie needs to be louder, angrier, and have access to a time machine
[4:12:53] <+Shishi1205> @Treasure_Vault can't block what you dont se
[4:12:53] <%scrumbotime> It's a biiiiit more effective to not just do diving thrusts at invisible women
[4:12:54] <SIydoc> no he didnt
[4:12:58] <QueequegTheater> @Treasure_Vault no lmao
[4:13:02] <dai_tonight> Reggie needs to think more like Guts.
[4:13:04] <+anoldtoilet> you cant use GMW with pole
[4:13:07] <+anoldtoilet> ohh
[4:13:15] <%Rafraud> Poison mist strats
[4:13:16] <%X2Eliah> hmm poison mist?
[4:13:18] <+anoldtoilet> why would you use a small hitbox rapier on this boss
[4:13:20] <noxeturna> If only the pardoner was here to forgive Reggie's sins.....
[4:13:21] <SIydoc> just use fire
[4:13:22] <+supertyleo> its the boss melter
[4:13:23] <sendart> ricard is dex tho
[4:13:23] <missile9000> I WANT MY MONEY REGGIE
[4:13:23] <derap41> and each time it pokes it does full added magic damage on each poke
[4:13:25] <%cobalt_phoenix_> biiig damage on that flurry
[4:13:27] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus It can, and that does work, but you'd need to upgrade the rapier for it to be worth doing
[4:13:27] <LunarRemix> It indeed can be buffed because it's a normal weapon
[4:13:33] <andre11dr> Isn't that a dex weapon? He's Int Str

[4:13:55] <derap41> Someone been fucking dragons
[4:13:58] <Jerp> I think Reggie is one of the most cautious players I've seen.  I wonder if he's noticed that enemies & bosses generally don't get more aggressive if you attack more often or flat out try to damage race them
[4:14:00] <agustorm123> Dancing Boar

[4:15:13] <SIydoc> she was the main character not you
[4:15:13] <%cobalt_phoenix_> and then we got bonfire chan

[4:15:41] <NireFuster> 80 casts my ass LUL
[4:15:50] <andre11dr> That toxic only works on players right?
[4:15:51] <Zooperton> hero devs realized the superiority of bonfire chan
[4:15:52] <GHouseduivel> Is the anime up to date with dark souls?
[4:15:56] <+Shishi1205> poison
[4:15:59] <+pectusumbra> could put on one of those attunement rings as well
[4:16:00] <derap41> You're not gonna break her stuff

[4:17:15] <NireFuster> Maybe a quick roll would be useful for this fight?
[4:17:19] <%hax_metatron> Did Reggie get the Bloodbite Ring?
[4:17:26] <dai_tonight> I can't say since I always killed him right away, but is there any reason Reggie hasn't invaded Lutrec's world?
[4:17:31] <NireFuster> Could always drop some of that armor or just pick some lighter armor for that FASHION
[4:17:32] <%KeiganOfAstora> Maybe Wolf Ring better?

[4:20:22] <Treasure_Vault> Love the one handing
[4:20:22] <NireFuster> @hax_metatron True, but he could always just go ''hey that title is interesting isn't it?'', once they meet Seath he can go all the way and just explain it
[4:20:24] <BigYanno> This is the one fight in dark souls I don't know how to do

[4:32:24] <%Rafraud> Back on ol gamefaqs
[4:32:25] <NireFuster> Might wanna cash those in
[4:32:25] <%BisoromiBear> best end is not swinging and staying anyway
[4:32:26] <MrATheGreat> That‚Äôs what ya get
[4:32:29] <%CaptainBeird> question reggie why pump endurance if your not gonna wear heavuer armor? i doubt he can easily fast roll with the boar helm
[4:32:34] <KaiserMario> "My game is bugged, the boss is invisible!"
[4:32:40] <haitakaa> or dex for the rapier
[4:32:45] <LunarRemix> Wait doesn't that mean he has to go through the celling again to pull down the elevator?
[4:32:47] <user_naim> Players getting trapped in a painting is really funny
[4:32:47] <+pectusumbra> but yeah there's options.
[4:32:48] <%KeiganOfAstora> @CaptainBeird Stamina dude
[4:32:57] <%pennykettle_> spoiler: I got stuck fighting Artorias and I thought I couldn't warp out, just like painted world because I thought they were both DLC. So I was "trapped" facing artorias HahaSweat
[4:33:00] <user_naim> I wish it would show how many people never got out
[4:33:04] <@Solidus_113> and this is why you don't chase skirts
[4:33:04] <+ds3namecaldara> losing the helm and shield he'd fast roll
[4:33:09] <derap41> You can beat the game at any level its fine
[4:33:17] <NireFuster> @ds3namecaldara Yeah he doesn't use the shield much so it'd be worth it
[4:33:19] <derap41> no need to minmax
[4:33:21] <noxeturna> 16 dex will unlock a lot of weapons
[4:33:22] <LVL1_Scumbag> Dex is okay
[4:33:30] <+Shishi1205> 16 dex is always good
[4:33:36] <gespenstkick> There are other good things
[4:33:40] <%KeiganOfAstora> DEX DEX DEX
[4:33:41] <haitakaa> it's slow though
[4:33:44] <%SarcFa> Can also switch as the situation depends
[4:33:44] <NireFuster> Yeah dex is totally different to a str weapon
[4:33:45] <%cobalt_phoenix_> he's got plenty of damage on the catchpole as is, so a few into dex is good
[4:33:46] <Teras_ode> has he gone through the touhou rampants yet?
[4:33:47] <+pectusumbra> it scales with dex as well anyway so you're still getting extra damage on your pole
[4:33:51] <+Shishi1205> @WoolieVersus spell cast speed go up too (just a bit)
[4:33:52] <NireFuster> It's like an entirely different playstyle
[4:33:52] <SethYuikora> did he kill the furry?  I walked away
[4:33:53] <derap41> Also Catch pole doesn't scale
[4:33:59] <%esoteric_simp> did i miss him fighting o+S?
[4:34:00] <MrATheGreat> So is O n S dead or‚Ä¶
[4:34:00] <dundore77> put the points into what you want. it does not matter you cannot break your build
[4:34:02] <Ros_Bef> Good hallway weapon
[4:34:07] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @SethYuikora he did :(
[4:34:12] <%KeiganOfAstora> He's so fucking strong
[4:34:13] <dai_tonight> @esoteric_simp Hasn't done it yet
[4:34:16] <+Shishi1205> 3k?
[4:34:16] <Darren716> you just did
[4:34:16] <@Solidus_113> you read it
[4:34:17] <%KeiganOfAstora> Anything over 400AR is huge
[4:34:22] <derap41> Twink weapons have high base stats but don't scale
[4:34:22] <dai_tonight> He hasn't gotten past the archers
[4:34:24] <%Laycas49> @MrATheGreat no
[4:34:26] <%esoteric_simp> @dai_tonight golly im excite
[4:34:32] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @MrATheGreat nah, he stopped at the archers and went in the painting
[4:34:32] <%CaptainBeird> stamina is fine and all but yeah i'd swing for harder personally in terms of endurance vs damage stat at this point i personally don't need too much stamina
[4:34:39] <sirrice77> @MrATheGreat He was not welcomed to the jam yet no
[4:34:47] <%KeiganOfAstora> Eat them boss souls
[4:34:52] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ayyy
[4:34:57] <Duskendawn> Probably won't reach O&S tonight
[4:34:59] <agustorm123> Or make boss weapons
[4:35:00] <+Shishi1205> @KeiganOfAstora not worth a lot
[4:35:02] <MrATheGreat> @laycas49 @sirrice77 coool. What about the archer run?
[4:35:02] <NireFuster> damn 25k souls to level up ONCE, we're almost halfway there boys
[4:35:04] <@Solidus_113> scaling yes
[4:35:08] <missile9000> Reggie now has a million different ways to very little damage
[4:35:09] <%Indigo_Automaton> Tiny bit of extra damage
[4:35:10] <Johannen> it does
[4:35:11] <+Shishi1205> it applies too
[4:35:13] <%RemedyofRevenge> it does that in this game
[4:35:14] <%KellBeII> that also applies in ds1
[4:35:14] <+pectusumbra> also we are getting close to reggie getting to find out what boss souls actually give him so he'll be able to cash in the ones he doesn't want soon
[4:35:14] <+Shishi1205> but super low
[4:35:15] <$Rumbutt> it does apply in DS1
[4:35:16] <Bonezthewonderful> SKIRTS
[4:35:17] <kenny_biff> it does woolie
[4:35:17] <%Finnmac5> It still does in DS1
[4:35:17] <gespenstkick> It  minimally applies here
[4:35:17] <%KeiganOfAstora> @Shishi1205 Some are
[4:35:18] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Duskendawn yea unless they do a long stream then next week
[4:35:18] <+askalta> woolie tell Reggie about the 27 str 2 handing cap
[4:35:18] <LunarRemix> It does but just a tiny little bit
[4:35:19] <%brandt_connors> it does from 35 - 45 If I remember correctly
[4:35:20] <agustorm123> level 65 we close
[4:35:22] <+eanscrale> It applies here up to a hard cap
[4:35:23] <wanderingdain90> it does apply but it's negligible
[4:35:23] <noxeturna> it absolutely applies in DS1
[4:35:27] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus What, DEX? It does indeed affect casting speed in DS1.
[4:35:35] <%cobalt_phoenix_> IT'S CHEWSDAY INNIT?
[4:35:38] <+Jiggisnipe> lol
[4:35:39] <tolloponik> ??????????

[4:35:45] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus And you also get more attack power on the Catch Pole
[4:35:47] <noxeturna> What day of the week is it? @WoolieVersus
[4:35:49] <+Bitscreed> The Tuesday curse
[4:35:49] <Teras_ode> it's tuesday my dudes
[4:35:51] <+pectusumbra> yeah, steam's offline
[4:35:55] <Treasure_Vault> KAM ON
[4:35:57] <@Solidus_113> tuesday steam maint. every tuesday forever
[4:35:58] <%BallerSwagBro9k> BRI ISH?
[4:35:59] <MrATheGreat> @a_german_spy REALLY?! Huh I thought that was DS 2 onward
[4:36:00] <andre11dr> Thanks Steam ,every time
[4:36:00] <jaygee303> We not done right???
[4:36:03] <%A_German_spy> @alphonseisbest The meta used to be around 100-120 for PvP
[4:36:03] <+anoldtoilet> ohhh
[4:36:04] <Estuko> Missed anything from 30 min ago? dog wanted to zoom so we zoomed aroudn the house
[4:36:04] <SethYuikora> @cobalt_phoenix_ ARYEW SCHTEWPID?!
[4:36:05] <nxflre> eeveerytime
[4:36:06] <%RemedyofRevenge> gonna upload dis clip onto yoochoob
[4:36:08] <DeathByPoke7> i got got by steam too
[4:36:09] <Duskendawn> Oh dammit forgot the steam BS
[4:36:10] <missile9000> @alphonseisbest I‚Äôve seen 120, 100, and 80
[4:36:12] <+anoldtoilet> lmao im not familiar with this steam quirk and almost panicked
[4:36:13] <+Bitscreed> Choosday shenanigans
[4:36:13] <%AbnormalVoid> LET'S GO LODERAN!
[4:36:13] <+Shishi1205> catch pole scales off of str dex and int
[4:36:14] <Treasure_Vault> lmao
[4:36:16] <%Ensign_Epic> it is indeed the Tuesday patch
[4:36:18] <%AbnormalVoid> SCOR SOM FACKIN SOULS
[4:36:18] <%KellBeII> 27 str means when you two hand you have 40 str
[4:36:22] <Astrophizz> wild that steam has to go down for updates
[4:36:28] <QueequegTheater> 2handing strength scaling has a soft cap at 27
[4:36:30] <@Solidus_113> Lifehunt scythe. it's cool
[4:36:37] <%A_German_spy> @MrATheGreat Yeah, the game does nothing to tell you about it. But it's a thing. DEX Pyromancer is an established build as a result of it.
[4:36:40] <+Shishi1205> @Solidus_113 cool properties
[4:36:42] <+anoldtoilet> @WoolieVersus the moonlight spear is int scaling and cool iirc
[4:36:46] <+askalta> 27 str 2 handing is equivalent to 40 str 1 handed
[4:36:51] <NireFuster> Are O and S weak to magic?
[4:36:59] <%Ensign_Epic> meta level for DS1 & DS3 is SL125; for DS2 it's SL150
[4:36:59] <SethYuikora> negative
[4:37:00] <derap41> Don't think so its a Twinkling weapon
[4:37:02] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Velka's is split damage, so it can't be buffed.
[4:37:03] <+anoldtoilet> F
[4:37:04] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @NireFuster i believe so
[4:37:05] <sendart> already magic
[4:37:07] <QueequegTheater> @NireFuster not particularly
[4:37:11] <OhGeeWhy> velka has occult on it already
[4:37:12] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Ricard's can
[4:37:13] <+Shishi1205> rickerts works
[4:37:19] <MrATheGreat> @a_german_spy I need to check that out next time I play :D
[4:37:25] <andre11dr> Richards definitely works
[4:37:27] <tolloponik> its occult so no
[4:37:30] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Also, special weapons usually can't be buffed
[4:37:33] <+Shishi1205> sunlight weapon buff + rickards go brrrrr
[4:37:33] <+anoldtoilet> unfortunately reggie is STR build
[4:37:37] <derap41> And anti god
[4:37:37] <missile9000> Randy‚Äôs rapier
[4:37:39] <youngking_kush> It's already a Magic Weapon
[4:37:46] <tolloponik> it will destroy this area
[4:37:47] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Would you consider summons for Seath to help with cutting the tail? Otherwise might be a pain to get Moonlight sword
[4:37:48] <derap41> 110 extra anti god damaga
[4:37:55] <%cobalt_phoenix_> actually velka's occult will do wonders on the enemies here
[4:37:59] <noxeturna> Velka's is not +5
[4:37:59] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1463039561215401988?t=hxoyuIobXdvYv38oBvV5_Q&s=19
[4:38:05] <NireFuster> He could always try out the rapier and see how it fares
[4:38:05] <Teras_ode> also upgrades
[4:38:07] <OhGeeWhy> @WoolieVersus Velka is amazing against certain enemies due to occult damage... O&S too
[4:38:13] <youngking_kush> Need to level it up yeah
[4:38:15] <haitakaa> ya gotta upgrade it
[4:38:17] <missile9000> @johannen Never
[4:38:17] <sendart> probably a fast str weapon out there
[4:38:25] <gespenstkick> A lot of those things in Anor Londo
[4:38:28] <%cobalt_phoenix_> which is most of the things in this area
[4:38:30] <derap41> Twinkling is easy to get too
[4:38:33] <+anoldtoilet> its not really ideal for his build because its a dex weapon
[4:38:33] <urkleturtle> also you'd need to go harder into int and stop spreading the spoints to take advantage of the scaling
[4:38:35] <Teras_ode> "divine" or "god like" entities
[4:38:36] <Johannen> @missile9000 ahh,shame such a cool weapon for his build
[4:38:38] <+eanscrale> It's not the strongest in its class, but it's worth using if you like the moveset
[4:38:53] <+Shishi1205> @A_German_spy I don't think woolie has seen the dex speeding casting in ds1
[4:38:54] <missile9000> @johannen I have no doubt Reggie will spend half an hour getting it
[4:38:56] <+pectusumbra> @anoldtoilet it's b scale on int though so it's not *bad* as a secondary
[4:38:59] <%cobalt_phoenix_> LUL
[4:39:00] <NireFuster> LUL yeah?
[4:39:00] <sendart> get some twinks
[4:39:02] <andre11dr> What even are the things that don't like occult?
[4:39:02] <tolloponik> wow this area is perfect for this weapon
[4:39:03] <derap41> Gotta get some Twinks in here
[4:39:04] <LoreKeeper_Thal> i want that twink UPGRADED
[4:39:04] <+xerotwo> LUL
[4:39:04] <NireFuster> get some of them twinks
[4:39:06] <wanderingdain90> look at how skinny it is
[4:39:08] <Iniudan> @anoldtoilet he more an all over the place build, pretty much the only thing has he not put point in is resistance and faith. =p
[4:39:08] <+anoldtoilet> just picking a random mundane weapon up to +5 or +10 and casting GMW is better than velkas for him
[4:39:14] <+anoldtoilet> magic enchant great club
[4:39:19] <+anoldtoilet> lol
[4:39:19] <derap41> Its really not that much
[4:39:19] <+Bitscreed> Ecuse me?!
[4:39:20] <+Shishi1205> soon
[4:39:20] <%SarcFa> @anoldtoilet it's more an int weapon than a dex weapon really, still won't hurt since it upgrades with twinkling which are easy to buy
[4:39:21] <tolloponik> about to buy some soon
[4:39:25] <+eanscrale> quite soon
[4:39:26] <@Solidus_113> Enemies weak to Occult are the Giants here, Black/Silver Knights, and the anor londo bosses
[4:39:28] <+Shishi1205> 6k per
[4:39:29] <%BisoromiBear> Anor Londo is well know for its twinks
[4:39:37] <Duskendawn> Hope there's enough upgrade mats for MLGS later
[4:39:38] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[4:39:39] <Treasure_Vault> If he's already got all these points in strength, enchant a strength weapon
[4:39:41] <NireFuster> @andre11dr Pretty much all divine enemies like those big ass knights
[4:39:42] <+alphonseisbest> do we know how much of the stream we have left for to day? like an hour or two?
[4:39:49] <Hammatime8> Time to get your hands on some twinks Kappa
[4:39:49] <+eanscrale> I'm so glad they made it purchaseable
[4:39:53] <seainspace> reggie's build sure needs a lot of twink
[4:39:57] <NireFuster> The knights all around anor londo are weak to occult
[4:39:59] <agustorm123> we wont see O&S today
[4:40:02] <PunkZedB> defeat the gods with facts and logic
[4:40:03] <@Solidus_113> it's really just here LUL
[4:40:03] <@Menitta> I see Reggie came to the wrong neighborhood
[4:40:03] <%DegenCat> HUNT THE GODDDDDDS
[4:40:08] <andre11dr> @nirefuster I imagine the first DLC boss also counts
[4:40:09] <fruit_pie_the_magician> He's gonna be hard pressed to ever find anything that outclasses that catchpole
[4:40:19] <+pectusumbra> reggie chasing skirts, chasing twinks
[4:40:20] <@Solidus_113> this whole zone just hates occult
[4:40:21] <%A_German_spy> @Solidus_113 Here and the final area
[4:40:23] <+Shishi1205> @WoolieVersus btw if he puts the dark sun ring she has special dialogue
[4:40:25] <NireFuster> @andre11dr Nope
[4:40:29] <dai_tonight> is she somehow related to lutrec? same-ish armor
[4:40:33] <Omentus> COME ON AND SLAM
[4:40:36] <+Shishi1205> the dark moon
[4:40:40] <%A_German_spy> @dai_tonight No relation
[4:40:42] <%hax_metatron> Funny how she‚Äôs so cool but also a super liar and evil
[4:40:44] <royb2> yay sesh didnt end yet
[4:40:45] <NireFuster> @dai_tonight Nah it's just yellow armor, Lautrec is from Carim
[4:40:52] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[4:40:53] <%A_German_spy> @dai_tonight The resemblance is just a coincidence
[4:40:53] <%hax_metatron> Archers time LUL
[4:40:58] <%cobalt_phoenix_> that couldve gone worse
[4:41:04] <NireFuster> @hax_metatron Is she? I never found her to be evil
[4:41:20] <dai_tonight> @A_German_spy Oh. Didn't even notice the resemblance until now, actually, just popped to mind.
[4:41:27] <sendart> he can go see dark boy
[4:41:32] <%hax_metatron> @nirefuster Bruh she‚Äôs associated with Gwyndolin, who‚Äôs the architect of this farce. That‚Äôs the reason she attacks you if you reveal Anor Londo to be dark
[4:41:36] <%A_German_spy> @dai_tonight It's understandable, but yeah, they're unrelated lore-wise.
[4:41:36] <royb2> 20k on archers gonna fuck him up
[4:41:38] <pepinillomaton> Oh, Xantou's leggins, funky
[4:42:01] <+pectusumbra> @royb2 arches fuck everyone up that's no bet at all
[4:42:03] <+alphonseisbest> wow chat can't help its self with the spoilers here huh LUL
[4:42:03] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Yeah but gwyndolin isn't evil
[4:42:04] <NireFuster> @hax_metatron Yeah but I never found her to be evil and cunning, she's just loyal to Gwyndolin, she sees it as an act of treason of course because you broke the covenant rules
[4:42:10] <+Shishi1205> Oh it might be the covenant only, i did with covenant + ring
[4:42:11] <MrATheGreat> Unique lines yeyeyeye
[4:42:17] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Have you taken Power Within for a spin, Reggie?
[4:42:21] <themetalraider> Mister Regy Crowley
[4:42:22] <%hax_metatron> @nirefuster Right, but they‚Äôre not the good faction the game.
[4:42:33] <NireFuster> @hax_metatron Let's be honest there's not a single GOOD faction in Dark Souls
[4:42:34] <dai_tonight> No way he manages to get past the archers. Been too long since the last attempt.
[4:42:39] <%cobalt_phoenix_> hey plus the extra slot is good
[4:42:42] <+Shishi1205> ok its the covenant
[4:42:43] <dai_tonight> But hey still believe in you Reggie!
[4:42:49] <%hax_metatron> @nirefuster Agreed. It‚Äôs us v them
[4:42:52] <BurdRightsActivist> @hax_metatron Dragons. :)
[4:42:53] <Johannen> One Guy
[4:42:54] <yukichocomilk> why are people trying to label characters as good or evil? that's now how this game works
[4:42:54] <+alphonseisbest> @hax_metatron idk sun bros are pretty alright
[4:42:56] <+2Vibe2Check> Kneel Kreygasm
[4:42:57] <Quack_of_Dawn> Woolie the liar
[4:43:02] <OblivionSword1> chat always lies

[4:43:04] <+Shishi1205> I had both
[4:43:06] <%Rafraud> Change ring?
[4:43:09] <derap41> Chat never lies is a parradox
[4:43:13] <%hax_metatron> @alphonseisbest Yeah they‚Äôre good, but also deluded.
[4:43:14] <+Shishi1205> @Solidus_113 come on man
[4:43:15] <+robertoszek> tell me lies, tell me sweet little lies
[4:43:18] <%CaptainBeird> chat lies except when we don't
[4:43:18] <Teras_ode> chat lies until it doesn't
[4:43:20] <andre11dr> @nirefuster Well the people that are just there to sell you stuff are the only ones that aren't evil
[4:43:21] <+foomaster22> He changed it back
[4:43:24] <Duskendawn> Fact checking will ruin the LP
[4:43:28] <%Lion_kun> There's still the very bottom he hasn't explored.
[4:43:29] <%DapperCadavr> chat how much longer does the show usually go?
[4:43:29] <dai_tonight> chat may lie
[4:43:36] <Johannen> They just be MAX acting thier Bows
[4:43:37] <peachy996> Chat is always right and only occasionally wrong
[4:43:45] <dai_tonight> @DapperCadavr Depends. Maybe another half hour?
[4:43:46] <%A_German_spy> @andre11dr I mean... Patches sells you stuff LUL
[4:43:49] <%Lion_kun> He can join another covenant right now if he puts on that ring.
[4:43:53] <%A_German_spy> @andre11dr So does Petrus
[4:43:59] <NireFuster> That's so accurate LUL
[4:44:00] <Darren716> @WoolieVersus Let him check down too
[4:44:01] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> hey I can play that on the ukulele
[4:44:03] <derap41> well maybe
[4:44:04] <%Rafraud> Did he put his old ring back?
[4:44:04] <andre11dr> @a_german_spy Ok except those guy LUL
[4:44:04] <Treasure_Vault> @DapperCadavr 30 minutes, but they might go long since there's only one DS stream this week.
[4:44:17] <Djinnazz> all you non-believers.
[4:44:17] <Ros_Bef> Man the red skirt fit his aesthetic way better
[4:44:19] <+Shishi1205> it can go one firther down
[4:44:20] <Darren716> What about double down stairs?
[4:44:24] <+Shishi1205> further
[4:44:26] <derap41> Woolie no
[4:44:27] <Quack_of_Dawn> What a mansion
[4:44:28] <NireFuster> I don't think Reggie has the ring required for that statue though so I doubt we'll see Gwyndolin
[4:44:35] <RickyRelucent> evening gents
[4:44:41] <%A_German_spy> @NireFuster He does have it
[4:44:42] <sendart> he can go down without fighting
[4:44:42] <+Shishi1205> @NireFuster he just put it on
[4:44:42] <sirrice77> @Ros_Bef Maybe but the piss stains fit the man better
[4:44:46] <MrATheGreat> Will Reggie decfy the odds???!?!
[4:44:51] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @NireFuster he does, it's the one he was told to put on a few minutes ago
[4:44:52] <derap41> Bad idea to do that now
[4:44:56] <+SaltySeaSam> the elevator goes down further, dark moon ring gets that covenant
[4:44:57] <+2Vibe2Check> He's wearing the ring right now isn't he?
[4:44:57] <NireFuster> Alright then I stand corrected, I joined late to the stream
[4:44:59] <jorniev> he looks so wasky man

[4:54:03] <wanderingdain90> all these years and I've never actually came up with a real strategy for The Archers outside of poison arrows
[4:54:03] <dundore77> somethings got to give
[4:54:05] <MrATheGreat> I‚Äôm gonna predict he makes it on the fourth try
[4:54:06] <yficaptions> why bet channel points with nothing to spend tho
[4:54:07] <Dabrikishaw> Oh, that explains a lot then
[4:54:08] <%Rafraud> FLOOOOOORRRRR
[4:54:11] <DestroPrime83> 2K on nay

[4:54:13] <+robertoszek> 3rd time run through
[4:54:18] <@Menitta> YEAH
[4:54:22] <SaintBeau> i should've voted yay
[4:54:22] <+Bitscreed> Let the Reggarth hit the floor
[4:54:24] <sendart> reggie is even wearing arrows lol
[4:54:25] <dai_tonight> I predict he'll go past them on the fifth attempt.
[4:54:27] <Iniudan> @TheOddJk Wrath of God work.
[4:54:30] <%swesterly> Ignoring downstairs yet again
[4:54:34] <+Mr_Pylon> Let's go NAH
[4:54:34] <MrATheGreat> Ooh even odds from chat
[4:54:37] <Teras_ode> or elden ring
[4:54:38] <sirrice77> @wanderingdain90 Run up as fast as you can goto the archer in the way and parry him to make him all off
[4:54:38] <%RemedyofRevenge> I would hope reggie gets to the black orb encounter today but its not looking likely on time
[4:54:43] <+Shishi1205> jump wiht Iframes baby
[4:54:44] <missile9000> I should have voted no
[4:54:46] <RickyRelucent> Reg could do a plunging here, if the giant is down the stairs
[4:54:46] <NireFuster> You can always just sprint past all the bullshit if you wanna get there quicker
[4:54:47] <SaintBeau> is reggie gonna do the DLC?
[4:54:48] <andre11dr> Ok  people actually believe in Reggie this time
[4:54:48] <Johannen> why close the betting so soon?
[4:54:50] <Quack_of_Dawn> God I am so hype for elden ring
[4:54:54] <Ros_Bef> Damn i only bet for him for the bad odds
[4:55:00] <RickyRelucent> don't think they actually move that far down
[4:55:00] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> has reggie seen any of the elden ring stuff?
[4:55:10] <+xerotwo> ASSIST ME doodStare
[4:55:11] <urkleturtle> 3 months until elden ring is way too far away. i can't deal
[4:55:16] <missile9000> I say Reggie gets to ‚Äòthe corner‚Äô and has his shield broken
[4:55:23] <dundore77> now your talking doubleteam
[4:55:35] <MrATheGreat> Yo if reggie dies before the archers does it still count?
[4:55:38] <@Menitta> people now believe in Reggie
[4:55:43] <+Dirty_Dandere> Nah

[5:08:01] <%BallerSwagBro9k> WE MIGHT SLAM JAM
[5:08:01] <%hax_metatron> Holy shit we also O&Sing today? Legendary stream
[5:08:03] <+Bitscreed> I believe in the Legend of Reggarth
[5:08:04] <zecaptain_james> i need biggie and smalls to serve reggie some humble pie
[5:08:07] <tolloponik> bigge and Smolls!
[5:08:09] <%megaman_sentinel> yo we still going
[5:08:12] <tactical_the_sloth> O&S HYPE
[5:08:12] <%TheBesteban> Damn, Reggie is like 20 levels higher than when I did this earlier today
[5:08:12] <%TheOddJik> Watch him just absolutely clumsily annihilate O&S on first try
[5:08:14] <gryffinp> on one hand woolie will really want to encourage reggie to summon for the boss, but on the other hand, we all know he deserves to suffer
[5:08:16] <%notsoy> 15k goddamn
[5:08:23] <dai_tonight> if we really do a 7 hour stream the anime is gonna be sooo far behind
[5:08:25] <RickyRelucent> little late
[5:08:25] <tactical_the_sloth> can we vote/predict O and S ??
[5:08:30] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Believe in the catchpole and it's legendary split damage
[5:08:31] <@Solidus_113> not a chance we get O&S today
[5:08:31] <RickyRelucent> but the stats are looking kinda good
[5:08:35] <RickyRelucent> still gotta pick a thing tho
[5:08:37] <shieldanvil> after that archer bullshit, reggie deserves no mercy
[5:08:44] <+Jiggisnipe> I think Reggie will destroy O&S like it's nothing lol
[5:08:48] <dundore77> just dont get hit
[5:08:48] <MrATheGreat> Vit/End is never wrong.
[5:08:49] <Awesome_Leaf> O&S first try ez
[5:08:51] <%Laycas49> better pizza
[5:08:51] <derap41> offense is the best defense
[5:08:56] <+anoldtoilet> vit/end is ALWAYS wrong
[5:09:10] <%TheOddJik> He's gonna spend like 6 hours getting there and then he's gonna 1st try it. The reggarth way
[5:09:10] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Bring dex to 25
[5:09:12] <yukichocomilk> nah vit is for scrubs
[5:09:12] <NireFuster> Vitality is a stat I only dump into once my other ones are all soft or hard locked honestly
[5:09:14] <tactical_the_sloth> he's gonna beat either O or S super fast, then not be ready for the twist
[5:09:14] <%megaman_sentinel> yea endurance
[5:09:17] <dai_tonight> level 66 and not a single stat over 30...
[5:09:19] <+anoldtoilet> billy madison in the tub going attack stats are better! they kill the bad guys fast!
[5:09:20] <NumbF4ke> O and Swill put Reggie in his place
[5:09:21] <araborthekronenberg> Resist to 99.
[5:09:27] <BlueEagle2395> Big INT boiz
[5:09:30] <%TheOddJik> END gang
[5:09:32] <olwe123> Dude if Reggie 1 times O&S then he is a god
[5:09:34] <royb2> Put luck up to 50
[5:09:34] <+Grayhammatter> HUNGRY
[5:09:40] <MrATheGreat> @araborthekronenberg the true Dark Souls experience
[5:09:40] <+eanscrale> High vit is invasion insurance mostly
[5:09:43] <RickyRelucent> @dai_tonight lvl 60, nothing over 25 and already done with catacombs, tombs anor and sens
[5:09:47] <NireFuster> Damn Reggie's got some great weapons
[5:09:55] <Duskendawn> He'll walk into O&S and their AI is accidentally turned off somehow
[5:09:55] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Quality+ INT means you can have strength, dex, int and pyro
[5:10:00] <araborthekronenberg> @mrathegreat For real though. XD
[5:10:10] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Max options
[5:10:11] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Yeah, but how many times have you been invaded by non-NPCs?
[5:10:14] <+alphonseisbest> Man 40 ENT is a fuckin drug
[5:10:16] <derap41> Try Velkas chenk the bonus damage
[5:10:20] <RickyRelucent> did he go painted world yet?
[5:10:23] <royb2> @Duskendawn He'll walk into O&S and O will just plunge through the floor and die in the void
[5:10:24] <dai_tonight> @RickyRelucent He hasn't finished tombs yet tho CorgiDerp
[5:10:24] <+Shishi1205> pve low vit is good enough
[5:10:27] <araborthekronenberg> He did do painted world.
[5:10:34] <%cobalt_phoenix_> with his luck, OnS will have one clip through the floor and instadie, then have the other one t-posing
[5:10:35] <RickyRelucent> @dai_tonight he's so close he's right by nito's :o
[5:10:42] <TheButtravage> @fruit_pie_the_magician You can have Pyro without any stat investment, the only stat that has any impact on pyro performance is Dex.
[5:10:53] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus The bullshit matchmaking system this game uses is all the insurance you need against invasions.
[5:11:03] <RickyRelucent> Wonder if he can find the bonfire hidden in the dark
[5:11:07] <%megaman_sentinel> yea i only go high vit for pvp
[5:11:18] <KaiserMario> y'know... I'm kinda mad Reggie didn't kill King Jeremiah properly, cause I couldn't say Reggie commited "Reggiecide"
[5:11:19] <sirrice77> Woolie has the app thing so reggie doesn't really need the insurance does he?
[5:11:22] <%cobalt_phoenix_> chat, reggie could not put another level in from here and his luck would do the rest lol
[5:11:22] <dai_tonight> Speaking of tombs, is it viable to get that one bright helmet before entering it?
[5:11:22] <+Shishi1205> watch Reggie get a lot of silver drops
[5:11:24] <%TheOddJik> I got non-stop invasions in Anor Londo just a couple weeks ago
[5:11:33] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I know, that's why I put strength, dex and int to like 30, so I can use everything that isn't a miracle
[5:11:36] <+pectusumbra> @dai_tonight Absolutely
[5:11:39] <Iniudan> @NireFuster kind of help when you get pretty much every rare weapon to drop =p
[5:11:42] <%A_German_spy> @sirrice77 Watchdog is only really insurance against cheaters and repeat stream-snipers
[5:11:53] <%cobalt_phoenix_> reggie how
[5:11:53] <%fart_bath> now THAT'S  a good looking Reggarth
[5:11:55] <NireFuster> @Iniudan Reggie's luck is off the charts
[5:11:56] <%A_German_spy> @sirrice77 which they haven't encountered any of yet
[5:11:56] <sirrice77> @A_German_spy Oh i see, i misunderstood
[5:11:57] <%RyTYoung> dayum
[5:12:06] <RickyRelucent> @dai_tonight he could, but he'd have to get upto firesage in izalith to get the sunlight bug
[5:12:13] <%Bread_Assassin> @dai_tonight I don‚Äôt see why not. Both areas unlock at the same time.
[5:12:13] <%TheOddJik> @A_German_spy Except for the Tarkus Impersonator
[5:12:15] <Awesome_Leaf> on my first run i accidentally aggroed solare here and didnt know you could go back to the other map to absolve :(
[5:12:19] <derap41> These guy be guarding
[5:12:27] <TheButtravage> @A_German_spy There really isn't any insurance for Reggie against invaders that know what they are doing.  Fortunately, many invaders will also just goof arond and go easy.
[5:12:27] <RickyRelucent> Not hard, one ezmode boss, few capras
[5:12:31] <RickyRelucent> kirk
[5:12:34] <+Sir_Louis> yeah these guys are parry central
[5:12:35] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[5:12:35] <tolloponik> learn to parry the Zone
[5:12:36] <+Grayhammatter> right in the butt
[5:12:38] <%AbnormalVoid> woolieKICKDAD
[5:12:38] <%BisoromiBear> get them cheeks
[5:12:40] <NireFuster> Notice how these guys are SILVER and not black knights
[5:12:40] <Darren716> So bets, how long until Reggie gets a silver knight drop?
[5:12:48] <%morgantj> get that yummy spear
[5:12:53] <araborthekronenberg> Silver knight drop in 4 kills.
[5:12:56] <+mechslayer71> Reggie's a WWAARRIIIIAAA
[5:12:58] <dai_tonight> @bread_assassin I was mostly asking for myself lol I haven't reached that part yet, lost the skull lantern and need to go back to the tombs BibleThump
[5:12:59] <Darren716> Imma give him 3
[5:13:00] <Duskendawn> That's the "hoo you walking towards me?" aggro range
[5:13:12] <%fart_bath> Reggarth what happened that was an innocent chest please
[5:13:12] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[5:13:14] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus I agree with your suspicions on that matter
[5:13:16] <MrATheGreat> 100%
[5:13:16] <@Solidus_113> this place on NG+ sucks ass
[5:13:20] <haitakaa> the silver knight sword is interesting
[5:13:28] <@Solidus_113> black phantoms are a pain
[5:13:32] <+Grayhammatter> he's schmooving
[5:13:40] <NireFuster> Parry him Reggie do it!!
[5:13:44] <dai_tonight> it's insane how long the knights remain relevant in the game
[5:13:45] <NireFuster> YEEEEAAHHHH

[5:13:57] <LunarRemix> Now he's really on Anor Londo
[5:14:02] <RickyRelucent> he could definately go down to izalith, im down there myself on a similar soul lvl
[5:14:03] <SaintBeau> PogChamp
[5:14:03] <%A_German_spy> @KaiserMario He can, but he isn't leveling Faith
[5:14:04] <+Bitscreed> Noice!
[5:14:07] <%swesterly> I like ya and I want ya
[5:14:12] <NireFuster> he EARNED it

[5:14:23] <@Solidus_113> oh right, offline
[5:14:23] <@Menitta> hey that means he's fucking good
[5:14:23] <NireFuster> Secret?
[5:14:24] <BlueEagle2395> there will be plenty more where that came from Woolie
[5:14:25] <MrATheGreat> Mor dors?
[5:14:25] <%cisealnine> "Get me wet." - Reggie 2021
[5:14:25] <drunken_lemur> What's that sound?
[5:14:26] <velgaduere> there are like 8 million rites of passage in this game, I think he'll be fine
[5:14:29] <SaintBeau> @RickyRelucent you can't go to izalith until you get the lordvessel
[5:14:30] <NireFuster> GOOD CATCH!
[5:14:31] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> ayyyeee

[5:14:33] <@Solidus_113> nice
[5:14:34] <derap41> Ckassic
[5:14:35] <+Grayhammatter> nice catch
[5:14:36] <TheButtravage> @KaiserMario 25 faith should be correct, you can also reduce the faith requirement by 5 everytime you help a player kill a boss.
[5:14:37] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Good eye, Reggie
[5:14:38] <Duskendawn> Hope his ego makes him forget about mimics
[5:14:39] <+warlockwithapixie> EYYYY
[5:14:41] <araborthekronenberg> Niiiiice one!
[5:14:41] <Teras_ode> good catch
[5:14:42] <RickyRelucent> @SaintBeau fair oint
[5:14:42] <+Sir_Louis> he's got his third eye open
[5:14:43] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Getting stabbed like that with the catchpole is so fucked up that its basically physically impossible
[5:14:43] <+Shishi1205> very good
[5:14:43] <+pectusumbra> the fact you can hear something helps
[5:14:44] <Awesome_Leaf> THIS man plays dark souls
[5:14:44] <PunkZedB> how does he see that but not see chests
[5:14:44] <sirrice77> LOL man i didn't even know about that one till someone showed me

[5:20:50] <+Sir_Louis> 99999999infinity
[5:21:00] <araborthekronenberg> This shit is why Havel got locked in a tower basement. XD

[5:21:46] <justcallmebobplease> FUCK OFF, MAGIC armor
[5:21:48] <missile9000> I like to think that this is straight up havels room, and we just raided his wardrobe
[5:21:48] <RedCycloneInc> "Its the Wall brpther!"
[5:21:48] <velgaduere> it's not called a Divine Heirloom for nothing

[5:22:27] <%debrv> Havel, the goddamn unbreakable.
[5:22:29] <derap41> Fashion souls
[5:22:29] <+eanscrale> Just, make sure no one gets behind you
[5:22:40] <RickyRelucent> havel hype
[5:22:41] <oak120> Occult Club as well
[5:22:44] <@Solidus_113> I go havel helm, dark body, black knight arms, and crimson cloth
[5:22:46] <%cobalt_phoenix_> can you even roll
[5:22:46] <derap41> Boar helmet fits the body good too
[5:22:46] <NireFuster> YOU are Havel now
[5:22:46] <missile9000> bludgeon the gods to death
[5:22:50] <ZeZheZe> dink
[5:22:53] <+ReallyBigRocks> *dink*
[5:22:59] <tolloponik> reggie can 2 hand it
[5:23:05] <velgaduere> Havel and the Rocks
[5:23:12] <missile9000> Havel on the rocks
[5:23:14] <RickyRelucent> ehhh, theres a few
[5:23:16] <shieldanvil> drop the lore on the occult club
[5:23:16] <+Shishi1205> üíØ
[5:23:17] <RickyRelucent> but its the best one.
[5:23:20] <dai_tonight> Yeah, that was my set CorgiDerp CorgiDerp
[5:23:32] <missile9000> Tell Reggie about havel‚Äôs god killing stick
[5:23:33] <derap41> Why was it there?
[5:23:34] <dai_tonight> until I replaced it with the stone set because it looked better imo
[5:23:39] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> the Ll o r e club
[5:23:40] <Iniudan> Technically giant is better, but you need to upgrade it.
[5:23:41] <+ReallyBigRocks> lemme just put on my 11lb gloves
[5:23:44] <fruit_pie_the_magician> put the boar helmet on with full havel
[5:23:45] <+anoldtoilet> the club has lore?
[5:23:45] <Teras_ode> to go clubbing in the occult part of town Kappa
[5:23:54] <tolloponik> the gauntlets are cool
[5:23:56] <RickyRelucent> think you'll be stuck with the skirt tho
[5:24:00] <%Ensign_Epic> Havel set is ez mode tbh
[5:24:05] <LunarRemix> Havel's set is straight up one of the best of the game
[5:24:09] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus You can also min-max one or two pieces of Havel's with the rest of a lighter set and a small weapon to achieve a ton of poise while still fast-rolling LUL
[5:24:10] <agustorm123> BIG OL ROLL
[5:24:10] <SaintBeau> @anoldtoilet it's the only occult imbued item in the game, and it's in the secret basement of Anor Londo
[5:24:13] <%RemedyofRevenge> you're gonna carry that weight
[5:24:20] <noxeturna> Are we ditching the Boar Helm?
[5:24:21] <%Ensign_Epic> Woolie was not exaggerating when he said it more or less turns off the game
[5:24:24] <missile9000> I‚Äôve never seen someone kill the four kings without it
[5:24:25] <+ReallyBigRocks> Unarmed damage should scale with the weight of your gauntlets
[5:24:37] <SaintBeau> they're trying to imply that Havel may have been planning to assassinate gwyn
[5:24:40] <derap41> Chain gloves are so cool
[5:24:42] <gryffinp> reggie has anti-fashion sense
[5:24:43] <dai_tonight> bye bye porky helmet
[5:24:51] <+Grayhammatter> bye bye bacon knight
[5:24:52] <Zooperton> fashionable :)
[5:24:53] <+anoldtoilet> @SaintBeau i thought they meant item description, yeah it being in the basement suggests it might be why havels got locked up
[5:24:58] <haitakaa> what's the magic poise number? like 55 or something?
[5:24:58] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Yup!
[5:25:03] <missile9000> +5ing black iron is actually stronger, but havel‚Äôs is way more reasonable
[5:25:06] <tolloponik> havel backflips
[5:25:07] <SIydoc> losing the boar helm gets rid of his luck
[5:25:10] <Duskendawn> I usually wear pinwheel mask, dingy chest, havel arms and legs for my runs
[5:25:11] <+ReallyBigRocks> get naked except for gloves
[5:25:12] <RickyRelucent> quickrolling with the heaviest sets fully usually takes 60+ end and some equipmentload magic
[5:25:15] <NireFuster> POWER skirt
[5:25:15] <TheButtravage> The gloves and chest piece in particular are very efficient poise to weight ratio.
[5:25:16] <GallowsDrop> Is the Boar Knight Reggarth over?
[5:25:17] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus I like this combo
[5:25:18] <%Ensign_Epic> Havel really, REALLY disliked magic. So much he was gonna kill Gwyn over Seath
[5:25:23] <derap41> Reggie doing anti fashion
[5:25:28] <dai_tonight> best club
[5:25:34] <%BisoromiBear> Beat God with a stick
[5:25:35] <%livlinn> No more boar boi? shiaCry
[5:25:36] <dai_tonight> not really though
[5:25:37] <fruit_pie_the_magician> plus fiving black iron costs like 40 twinkling though
[5:25:39] <SaintBeau> but why would it be imbued with Occult power Kappa
[5:25:40] <%megaman_sentinel> bitch be good stick
[5:25:42] <haitakaa> by Umbasa
[5:25:44] <@Solidus_113> hanging in this basement, next to Havel's gear
[5:25:47] <@Solidus_113> sus
[5:25:50] <+Bitscreed> The Devil‚Äôs wood
[5:25:52] <oak120> With this stick imma kill god
[5:25:52] <derap41> Bonk the gods
[5:25:53] <Djinnazz> Cut from the tree of life.
[5:25:53] <missile9000> Havel hated magic, and his best friend cursed humanity then joined forces with a magic dragon
[5:25:53] <+profanityincluded> the boar was the luck !
[5:26:08] <sirrice77> Havel was playin dem devil games
[5:26:09] <agustorm123> is a big weapon
[5:26:09] <MrATheGreat> Bonk the silver knights
[5:26:11] <Teras_ode> and thrown in the basement in the City of Gods, someone really didn't want it to be out there were people could see or use it
[5:26:13] <%debrv> Literal Belief boosted the Unga Bunga.
[5:26:17] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @missile9000
[5:26:26] <NireFuster> Return to primal human, BONK

[5:26:48] <derap41> Like Velka
[5:26:53] <+ReallyBigRocks> if you believe the club is good then it IS good
[5:26:54] <GHouseduivel> He didn't know what he was messing with.
[5:27:01] <%buerdo> Wooden club is the strongest weapon in game tell me otherwise
[5:27:06] <derap41> Bonk the god on the head
[5:27:07] <@Solidus_113> and was locked away for it
[5:27:09] <velgaduere> read the ring again
[5:27:11] <MrATheGreat> This rock was leading a charge against Anor Lonco
[5:27:11] <peachy996> muffled Van Halen playing in the distance
[5:27:13] <gruulmagebeast> its interesting to see pat guide woolie through all of DS1 and then a while later now see woolie guiding reggie
[5:27:14] <%seydaq> batman havel
[5:27:14] <%RemedyofRevenge> @WoolieVersus get reggie to read the havel ring description again

[5:28:13] <%TheOddJik> The Golden Rock Arc

[5:28:53] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus STINGS THE EYES LUL
[5:28:54] <NireFuster> Don't judge Reggie's OC man LUL
[5:28:55] <derap41> Anti fashion
[5:28:56] <PunkZedB> piss yellow
[5:28:56] <dundore77> honestly nothing matches
[5:28:59] <LunarRemix> Yeah
[5:29:00] <TheButtravage> @WoolieVersus That's because the occult club is a pre-upgraded +10 weapon.
[5:29:00] <kikosmore> dude looks like clown shoes lol
[5:29:00] <%notsoy> THIS YELLOW THIS YELLOW THIS YELLOW
[5:29:00] <%DapperCadavr> it's kinda uggo LUL
[5:29:02] <%kyh9> STINGS THE EYES
[5:29:03] <gespenstkick> @missile9000 Still stronger than the club though. Even outdamages Artorias's great sword
[5:29:04] <Shwepie> Occult Club is basically a +10 weapon
[5:29:05] <LunarRemix> Yeah Woolie's right
[5:29:05] <+ReallyBigRocks> too many colors
[5:29:05] <Iniudan> Technically the club is basically a +10 weapon
[5:29:05] <DolphinHandsTiger> Mustard boy
[5:29:06] <peachy996> Be nice to Havel's pretty summer dress
[5:29:08] <haitakaa> and your naked legs
[5:29:08] <+Grayhammatter> stings the eyes
[5:29:09] <%waltzqueen> ANTI DRIP
[5:29:10] <+Bitscreed> I like the yellow! :(
[5:29:10] <+stantashev> stings the eyes yes
[5:29:10] <kikosmore> It does not match lol
[5:29:10] <Teras_ode> but TOES tho
[5:29:11] <dai_tonight> too many colors
[5:29:11] <%Prevot> it didn't even work before

[5:29:18] <+ReallyBigRocks> yeah thats it
[5:29:18] <glass_marcus> better
[5:29:20] <%cobalt_phoenix_> better
[5:29:20] <+anoldtoilet> i like this
[5:29:20] <derap41> Silver skirt though
[5:29:20] <agustorm123> NOW WE COOKING
[5:29:21] <+Grayhammatter> that looks better
[5:29:21] <dai_tonight> better
[5:29:21] <NireFuster> THAT WORKS
[5:29:21] <velgaduere> yellow is my least favorite color for exactly this reason
[5:29:22] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Firekeeper Skirt might match better, or the Gold-Hemmed Skirt
[5:29:23] <+azraith> Infinitely more sick
[5:29:24] <@Solidus_113> try the gold hemmed
[5:29:24] <sendart> elite knight pants
[5:29:25] <gruulmagebeast> that looks way better
[5:29:25] <missile9000> Piss-stained Crusader!
[5:29:25] <peachy996> Oooh seductive
[5:29:25] <kikosmore> better
[5:29:26] <GHouseduivel> That works
[5:29:26] <Teras_ode> and FEET Kreygasm
[5:29:28] <resloxxx> better
[5:29:29] <%Ensign_Epic> MUCH better
[5:29:29] <$Alderain971> that is great
[5:29:30] <%espanishcanamurciana> Piss Havel
[5:29:30] <+pectusumbra> yeah the helment is rock-grey
[5:29:30] <dundore77> better but the head still looks lame
[5:29:34] <+Sir_Louis> going for that warlock vibe
[5:29:34] <ashenjuan25> Did he beat O and S yet?
[5:29:35] <MrATheGreat> Business up top, mess at the bottom
[5:29:38] <TheButtravage> Yeah, red or black probably blends better.
[5:29:40] <%Irridium> return to boar
[5:29:41] <SaintBeau> that bitch from Demon Slayer
[5:29:41] <%espanishcanamurciana> Now you‚Äôre a Roman centurion

[5:29:44] <agustorm123> FASHION SOULS
[5:29:45] <+Shady_Zaku> SHUT UP WOOLIE! Boar head SUCKS
[5:29:46] <missile9000> @ashenjuan25 no
[5:29:48] <%Ensign_Epic> Try the gold hemmed black skirt
[5:29:51] <Duskendawn> Reggie adamant about wearing a skirt
[5:29:52] <ashenjuan25> Dope
[5:29:55] <ashenjuan25> Let‚Äôs go
[5:29:55] <+pectusumbra> gold-hemmed?
[5:29:56] <MinersLoveGames> go back to the boar.
[5:29:56] <TheButtravage> @ashenjuan25 Nah, he just got inside.
[5:29:57] <+tempestzephyr> Boar gave like Druid/shaman vibes
[5:29:58] <dai_tonight> logistically, how comfortable would a dress be in the battlefield?
[5:29:58] <+Bitscreed> Boo! Yellow or bust
[5:30:02] <%linSP> knight is coolerb
[5:30:05] <missile9000> Smokin Sexy Style!!!
[5:30:19] <wqorst> bring back boar helmet
[5:30:20] <dundore77> the head is the worst part of havels set
[5:30:25] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus This looks MUCH better
[5:30:27] <derap41> sadge
[5:30:27] <dai_tonight> too standard
[5:30:30] <NireFuster> Eh too basic
[5:30:31] <+ReallyBigRocks> a classic
[5:30:33] <+anoldtoilet> i like havels helm
[5:30:34] <%waltzqueen> @dai_tonight as long as you can lift your legs quickly and put them down quickly without tripping you're good. So realisticly calf length is fine for battle
[5:30:34] <NireFuster> But it's fine
[5:30:35] <haitakaa> basic
[5:30:35] <%BisoromiBear> this is the real endgame
[5:30:39] <RickyRelucent> Boar got ditched because he didnt find armor that goes especially well with it
[5:30:39] <SaintBeau> Elite Knight Helm/Gauntlets/Boots + Sorceror Robes
[5:30:40] <derap41> Woolie stepping or reggies creativity
[5:30:41] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus And more Poise/Defense with this, too\
[5:30:42] <oak120> Im missing the board helm honestly

[5:55:59] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Yup thats concept art
[5:56:02] <derap41> No its real art prromise
[5:56:03] <tuesti> his head is so tiny
[5:56:03] <%Dopamien> tiny head
[5:56:04] <+eanscrale> nah.. this is diegetic painting
[5:56:05] <a_mad_dragon_> tiny head yaoi character
[5:56:06] <DSD24> What rings you got
[5:56:07] <+ReallyBigRocks> it's cool concept art tho
[5:56:12] <youngking_kush> Big concept art lol
[5:56:13] <Duskendawn> This is DeS tower knight scale
[5:56:14] <yukichocomilk> miyazaki went like "this looks sick"
[5:56:19] <NireFuster> @BitterBlack0 Yeah I was thinking of that but I just wondered if maybe some details or aspects are more fantasy-ish rather than real gothic architecture, no complaints just observations
[5:56:20] <+Reverend_Roscoe> that one painting looked like Shadow of the Colossus
[5:56:20] <peachy996> I'll allow it
[5:56:22] <dundore77> isn't everything in that room concept art
[5:56:27] <%A_German_spy> @Ensign_Epic Eh, maybe on a VIT gouge build, but under pretty nearly any circumstances there are universally better PvP rings.
[5:56:28] <TheButtravage> @Ensign_Epic I don't really see anyone use it in a pvp build, mask of the mother pretty much does the same thing and doesn't take up a slot.
[5:56:28] <Deewtssob> Yes lol
[5:56:30] <dai_tonight> Miyazaki: shut up gaijin it's my concept art
[5:56:30] <peachy996> Concept Art is so overlooked these days
[5:56:32] <derap41> only one place left
[5:56:45] <peachy996> Even on bad games the concept art can be AMAZING
[5:56:49] <dmtjinni> drippy
[5:56:57] <%Ensign_Epic> @thebuttravage you ringswap off of it after taking the first hit
[5:56:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> Notre Dame Cathedral times 1000

[5:57:16] <%A_German_spy> @TheButtravage Favor and Protection also does the same thing but far better, and several other things on top of that
[5:57:20] <SixthShinx> There has ben messages, right?
[5:57:33] <shieldanvil> fromsoft seeded the world with messages
[5:57:42] <TheButtravage> @Ensign_Epic You might as well just have hornet on from the start instead of expecting to take a hit.  Especially since the majority of builds already use Favor as a staple.

[5:57:59] <RickyRelucent> @A_German_spy Definately the best options out of the bunch, unless u just want havel for heavy duty equipment load
[5:58:00] <%Ensign_Epic> tiny being isn't supposed to meet the same goal as FAP. It's an extra hit that you ringswap off of

[5:58:37] <Tempmael> cold blodded
[5:58:37] <%A_German_spy> @RickyRelucent Havel and Favor are definitely the most common PvP rings, yeah. Sometimes simple is just better.
[5:58:37] <%fetrigon> Reggie... just....

[5:58:38] <yukichocomilk> REKT LUL

[5:58:47] <velgaduere> it'll be easy tog et back at least
[5:58:47] <Tempmael> not like this

[5:59:00] <+warlockwithapixie> Its fiiiinne
[5:59:00] <RickyRelucent> @A_German_spy if somebody says they dont like havel +rofap theyy're a dirty liar
[5:59:01] <youngking_kush> Whyyy
[5:59:02] <%esoteric_simp> i just want to see his reaction to o+s ><
[5:59:07] <Tempmael> stack thost souls
[5:59:08] <DeathByPoke7> time for jumping?
[5:59:09] <catasteroid0> show him the jump
[5:59:12] <%A_German_spy> @RickyRelucent Or a mage
[5:59:14] <derap41> Gonna show the stair skip?
[5:59:21] <%TheBesteban> The food is getting cold at this cookout, Reggie. Please hurry.
[5:59:24] <andre11dr> It was bound to happen, he was feeling himself
[5:59:25] <missile9000> Stair skip!
[5:59:37] <%fetrigon> That was extremely greedy LUL
[5:59:37] <%Rafoki> no, he should only know the skip once he gets the real path
[5:59:39] <+foomaster22> Not until its needed, he's only died once chat come on
[5:59:39] <agustorm123> Reality is a bitch
[5:59:41] <NireFuster> Stair skip would save a lot of time
[5:59:42] <%A_German_spy> Reggie hasn't earned the stair skip yet
[5:59:47] <derap41> @Rafoki he just got there
[5:59:50] <%Ensign_Epic> Havel and FAP both just means you don't know how to build
[5:59:51] <Mitchellsocks> Woolie teach jump plz
[5:59:51] <Reveresao> @Rafoki he did tho
[5:59:52] <%A_German_spy> That tech ain't free
[5:59:53] <+ReallyBigRocks> seriously tho who put a giant demon in the tiniest little chapel room in Anor Londo
[5:59:53] <+tussletoes> stair skip ganggg
[5:59:57] <+yeknomlive> there's a jump
[5:59:57] <missile9000> Reggie just paid 32K to unlock the stair skip
[5:59:57] <+Bearded_mushrum> sneaky skip
[5:59:58] <velgaduere> there is, but it's tricky
[5:59:58] <Teras_ode> a specific jump
[6:00:00] <%Dopamien> lmao
[6:00:01] <tolloponik> wait you don't?!
[6:00:02] <+Sir_Louis> its just a tricky jump yeah
[6:00:03] <yukichocomilk> speedrun thing
[6:00:04] <kulmoth> speed run strats
[6:00:04] <%hax_metatron> Just requires a masterful jump
[6:00:04] <%esoteric_simp> my mans gotta kindle that bonnie
[6:00:05] <+yeknomlive> no worries
[6:00:06] <NireFuster> Oh really?? Wow
[6:00:07] <+Bearded_mushrum> stair jump best jump for real
[6:00:07] <%RemedyofRevenge> honestly its not too hard
[6:00:08] <%Dopamien> its cool
[6:00:09] <+Grayhammatter> it's a bit tricky
[6:00:10] <Mitchellsocks> The jump is way easier than it initially looks
[6:00:11] <sendart> its a pretty easy jump
[6:00:11] <missile9000> Reggie is too DUMB
[6:00:16] <+Bearded_mushrum> simple bread and butter skip
[6:00:17] <+robertoszek> it's a cool easy jump
[6:00:17] <TheButtravage> It's a pretty lenient jump.
[6:00:19] <NireFuster> It's not incredibly hard, just run up to it and jump alongside the rail and it should get you across
[6:00:22] <%hax_metatron> Right in the dick
[6:00:24] <tactical_the_sloth> KINDLE THE BONFIRE REGGIE
[6:00:27] <+ReallyBigRocks> just jump on every staircase, just in case
[6:00:27] <+Bearded_mushrum> very good jump
[6:00:27] <+robertoszek> @missile9000 excuse you
[6:00:27] <Teras_ode> and it's sequence breaking, not the intended route
[6:00:28] <+Daoshinto> hop over the railing from higher up on the stairs, right over into the hallway towards the giants
[6:00:28] <youngking_kush> @a_german_spy "The game is to be sold not told"
[6:00:29] <RickyRelucent> @Ensign_Epic figuring out how much equipmentload total u need for your given set is hard, especiallyy when ur switching pieces all the time
[6:00:32] <shieldanvil> force him through this again, he deserves it for the archers
[6:00:33] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @missile9000 do not
[6:00:33] <%esoteric_simp> sick
[6:00:39] <sirrice77> which is harder the stair jump or the ds3 tree jump?
[6:00:40] <True_STooPkid> Watch someone else do the jump and you'll get it in no time.
[6:00:42] <cartakus> Hey demon titanite pole? Nice RNG reggie
[6:00:43] <%Rafoki> @Reveresao wait he opened the door opposite of the demon? wall then
[6:00:46] <DSD24> I love the parry sound effect
[6:00:48] <dundore77> its not like hes having trouble with the knights
[6:00:50] <RickyRelucent> @Ensign_Epic even moreso if you dont have a character planner like mugenmonkey to check the numbers
[6:00:57] <%A_German_spy> @youngking_kush Well, more to the point, he's gotten down there exactly once. No need to hand it to him quite so soon.
[6:00:59] <Mitchellsocks> DS3 tree jump is exponentially harder
[6:01:02] <+askalta> he can take that demon
[6:01:02] <%Rafoki> @Reveresao well then*
[6:01:13] <NireFuster> Shortcut porn incoming....
[6:01:17] <%SaintBeau> lol
[6:01:17] <DJ6S> yooo just got here he switched off the boar helm??
[6:01:29] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Check your Discord DMs, Woolie
[6:01:33] <%SaintBeau> jesus
[6:01:34] <NireFuster> The stair skip is mostly for whenever you JUST get to this area, once you open the shortcuts it's a little meh
[6:01:36] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @dj6s its a new era
[6:01:51] <bestwaifuritsu> smooth
[6:01:51] <%hax_metatron> PARRY GOD
[6:01:53] <%cobalt_phoenix_> holy fuck he's good
[6:01:55] <%esoteric_simp> reggie is a god?
[6:01:56] <wandelmilch> the BEAST is here
[6:01:56] <missile9000> Reggie is thirsty for blood
[6:01:57] <%BallerSwagBro9k> PARRY GOD
[6:02:03] <shieldanvil> wtf reggies actually good at this game
[6:02:04] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Ah, okay, cool
[6:02:05] <DJ6S> The age of boar has ended
[6:02:06] <velgaduere> TIME TO BE SHINY
[6:02:08] <NireFuster> SILVER KNIGHT SET LET'S GO
[6:02:09] <DeathByPoke7> fashion
[6:02:11] <+Bearded_mushrum> very nice jump however

[6:02:14] <%SaintBeau> socpensFroggerPogger socpensFroggerPogger
[6:02:14] <derap41> Its got a tiny cape
[6:02:14] <Mitchellsocks> @nirefuster nah, it‚Äôs for cutting the OS run in 1/3
[6:02:15] <BitterBlack0> chat impressed a fighting game player has parry timings down LUL
[6:02:17] <RickyRelucent> clothing! : 3
[6:02:20] <+ReallyBigRocks> hmm some of those dragon heads are a little PS1 looking
[6:02:20] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[6:02:20] <velgaduere> but if you DON'T respect em
[6:02:22] <cartakus> Tiny head knight
[6:02:22] <+Ultimate_Edge> You too can be a dragon slaying silver knight
[6:02:22] <PunkZedB> the cape is solid
[6:02:23] <youngking_kush> Reggie might as well use a Buckler at this point
[6:02:24] <%Ensign_Epic> this is some damn solid gear in all the games you can find it in
[6:02:24] <+Bearded_mushrum> glad you got to see it
[6:02:25] <dundore77> but only if you respect them
[6:02:27] <missile9000> The cardboard cape!
[6:02:28] <velgaduere> keep that shit OFF your body, filth
[6:02:28] <%hax_metatron> I had no doubt Reggie would be pro at this game. Now I just need him to get into PvP. I seriously think he'll kick ass.
[6:02:30] <DSD24> Silver Bois
[6:02:33] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Silver knight shit is legit
[6:02:35] <agustorm123> Love the set
[6:02:35] <RickyRelucent> @PunkZedB it sure is
[6:02:37] <Duskendawn> Can't wait for reg to get to bloodborne
[6:02:46] <%Ensign_Epic> I use the silver Knight leggings in my DS3 66 STR build
[6:02:49] <+ReallyBigRocks> big protecc
[6:02:55] <iinsectaa> simps
[6:02:56] <%hax_metatron> HUGE LORE
[6:02:56] <NireFuster> No cloth physics on the cape though :(
[6:02:57] <%Samk235> The other half did chad stuff
[6:02:59] <NireFuster> Huge bummer
[6:03:01] <peachy996> For a thing with no head Titanite Demon is such an obnoxious mouth breather
[6:03:01] <sirrice77> Well the helmet sucks, or is that just the black knight set?
[6:03:02] <%BisoromiBear> The Black Knights saw some shit
[6:03:03] <NireFuster> Not even in the remaster
[6:03:04] <youngking_kush> BIG LORE
[6:03:05] <Mitchellsocks> No Silver Knight weaponry is a huge bummer in DS3
[6:03:05] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> He just read that
[6:03:06] <derap41> Baby capes
[6:03:10] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Black Knights did some Baller shit
[6:03:11] <cartakus> No havel monster?
[6:03:12] <Iniudan> always wish that the silver and black knight helm wasn't so thin.
[6:03:13] <glass_marcus> these are the house knights
[6:03:14] <%SaintBeau> the Black Knights are the personal bodyguards, whereas the Silve Knights guard Gwynevere
[6:03:17] <tolloponik> wait why dose it have Less Poise that's Sad
[6:03:26] <TheButtravage> @hax_metatron PvP's a pretty different game, if he got into it he would benefit looking up some basic tech videos to understand how the latency impacts the game.
[6:03:29] <%Prevot> skinny head
[6:03:30] <%Ensign_Epic> @mitchellsocks SK Spear is very missed
[6:03:31] <DJ6S> Is reg doing bb after or before Ds3?
[6:03:32] <missile9000> Wish there was a silver knight greatsword
[6:03:41] <derap41> Smooshed
[6:03:44] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @dj6s DS2
[6:03:48] <Monkeyweed21> @Iniudan just make your character a pinhead lol
[6:03:52] <sirrice77> @SaintBeau I thought they were all silver knights and the black knights were just the ones gwyn took that got burnt
[6:03:53] <+pectusumbra> it is lighter with better defenses
[6:03:55] <RickyRelucent> the set is umm, mediumish
[6:04:04] <RickyRelucent> heavier then elite knight
[6:04:06] <peachy996> I really hope we get to BB instead of the neverending slog that is DS2
[6:04:06] <%IDTheftVictim> IDTheftVictim subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 36 months! enjoying the stream, you're doing great
[6:04:08] <Teras_ode> implies the silver and black knights were not humans
[6:04:08] <%Ensign_Epic> @sirrice77 that's accurate
[6:04:10] <+Bearded_mushrum> HEAVIER
[6:04:12] <missile9000> @sirrice77 I think the black knights are bigger
[6:04:16] <cartakus> Yeah what is up with the weapons being different for silver and black knights?
[6:04:21] <%Prevot> silver knight helm can't be any worse than that abomination reggie's currently wearing
[6:04:23] <DJ6S> @BallerSwagBro9k I mean after ds2
[6:04:24] <%cobalt_phoenix_> yo
[6:04:25] <%SaintBeau> @SaintBeau i mean that the silver knights that became black knights WERE gwyn's bodyguards lol
[6:04:27] <NireFuster> Lookin COOL
[6:04:29] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[6:04:32] <Iniudan> @DJ6S unless there is a delay between each game, better to play Bloodborne after, as Bloodborne make Dark Souls game feel clunky to play, due to much faster combat.
[6:04:32] <%Ensign_Epic> canonically the Black knights are silver knights that were taken to fight the chaos flame and got themselves burnt away and turned into suits of armor
[6:04:35] <+„Çª„Éì„Éº> black knight helm is a lil different iirc
[6:04:38] <Awesome_Leaf> RIP boar head :(
[6:04:39] <%hax_metatron> REMOVE THE ARROWS PLEASE BibleThump
[6:04:40] <TheButtravage> @peachy996 I wanna see DS2 I love to see the comparisons people make going from 1 to 2.
[6:04:42] <oak120> would probably match the Boar Helmet better
[6:04:43] <agustorm123> You Evolved
[6:04:44] <NireFuster> SHORTCUT PORN
[6:04:45] <+Shady_Zaku> STYLIN doodGood

[6:04:52] <%Ensign_Epic> the Black Knight armor mentions this
[6:04:52] <iinsectaa> skirt so short
[6:04:55] <missile9000> Hnnnnnnnnnng
[6:04:55] <+Grayhammatter> shortcut
[6:04:56] <%hax_metatron> ARROWS RUINING FASHION NotLikeThis
[6:04:58] <derap41> porrn
[6:04:59] <sirrice77> @SaintBeau Yeah i assumed they were elites or something which is why they have different weapons but they were still technically the same

[6:06:42] <NireFuster> @Shady_Zaku Yep, I don't know why they didn't implement cloth physics for the remaster either
[6:06:50] <True_STooPkid> Has anyone trolled him into leveling Resistance yet?
[6:06:51] <+pectusumbra> can go kill some knight

[6:13:40] <%hax_metatron> That's always been my biggest motivator with Souls games. Just knowing that someone out there is beating this currently naked, without getting touched with a fork.
[6:13:40] <Johannen> But if you wanna use some cool shit thou
[6:13:41] <NireFuster> Next session might just be the end I think, unless he does DLC first, Reggie has been BLASTING through DS1
[6:14:12] <noxeturna> Technically speaking, high Vit and low damage stats is just as viable, but in a different way (Raw/Chaos/Anything with high base, low scaling) but you have to know about it and commit to it
[6:14:14] <sendart> its a good amount
[6:14:15] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Good way to look at it, honestly. I never thought about it that way, but you're super right.
[6:14:16] <stoatacious> @NireFuster there's still quite a lot to go
[6:14:16] <derap41> It stacks
[6:14:19] <atomizedstream> stamina regen is good

[6:14:36] <RickyRelucent> the shield
[6:14:37] <%AbnormalVoid> Mom used to be better, iirc
