[0:26:41] <sonofthedeepsouth> KOREAN AGE
[0:26:42] <+gustavozxd> ????????
[0:26:42] <IndiaSwift> wow
[0:26:42] <+linSP> Cooking mama part 2 when
[0:26:46] <bleugh> k-age
[0:26:47] <alrobot2014> so you've got your age, then your KOREAN AGE
[0:26:50] <IndiaSwift> I learned something!
[0:26:50] <NeroInfinite> AGE RECKONING
[0:26:52] <megamirk> "it doesn't affect their Korean age" LUL
[0:26:55] <Shishi1205> So you are sometimes 2 years older than you are
[0:26:56] <%jiggy_snipe> that is a fun fact
[0:26:56] <BlacSoul> KAGE
[0:26:58] <sonofthedeepsouth> That sounds super anti-individualist
[0:26:58] <+Mkingston> You told us to make an RPG. We made Quest 64 but we made an RPG..
[0:27:02] <nepwar> That means all koreans are legal at the same time
[0:27:04] <BallerSwagBro9k> EXTRA AGE STAT NotLikeThis
[0:27:07] <damascussteele> does korean age start at 1
[0:27:07] <+Joelexion> Cheat the system by being born December
[0:27:09] <%bread_assassin> Let it be known that I'm never wrong when it comes to fun facts.
[0:27:19] <+tearfuldevil> its an east asian thing woolie
[0:27:20] <bleugh> Kdashing
[0:27:24] <+gustavozxd> slightly wrong?
[0:27:26] <megamirk> extra stats on char creation
[0:27:27] <+therabbles> government age
[0:27:29] <%Superbro64> disingenuous information, my favorite sajamErnie
[0:27:35] <%ekodrop> no woolie, he said that your age starts at 1 not 0
[0:27:36] <nyacoo> So is it just a traditional thing that's in the back of everyone's mind, but is it actually the default used in everyday life?
[0:27:37] <+cha0tic_klutch> Age is just a number :) It’s the back pain that counts
[0:27:37] <OldManDeckardCain> fun fact, a similar system functioned at Epstein's island Kappa
[0:27:46] <%jiggy_snipe> just be born on new years day 4Head
[0:27:47] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:27:47] <Camail> saying "additional" implies the regular is more important to them
[0:27:47] <SomeponysScribbles> So what happens if you were born on December 31st? Does that mean you get an instant level 2?
[0:27:50] <BlacSoul> !Wrong
[0:27:51] <megamirk> Plastic surgery affinity and +1 to Korean Age on startup
[0:27:58] <nepwar> is that why koreans get enlisted a lot eariler than usual
[0:27:59] <Brandon__Brando> fact checking will ruin this stream

[0:32:34] <Shishi1205> Written pat sounds as accurate as normal Pat
[0:32:38] <ReelDeath> not as expressive
[0:32:39] <%Th3SmartAlec> Your meme... dies with youj.

[0:54:11] <%gatorafan> Discord breakdown daedra1LaughingTibs
[0:54:14] <%jiggy_snipe> Woolie's opinion is that he just wants the select button back and share button still exist

[0:54:18] <+tearfuldevil> which discord is the breakdown in?
[0:54:19] <+Joelexion> F
[0:54:25] <%Hawkbone_> IT STILL HAS A FUCKING SELECT BUTTON
[0:54:25] <%arkv01> the share button is universally garbage
[0:54:26] <Twinmin> Wait did they not start yet or just finish?
[0:54:27] <C4m3r0n0409> TOUCHPAD IS SELECT
[0:54:30] <+gustavozxd> the touchpad is 2 different select buttons
[0:54:31] <%SuperKirby24> F
[0:54:31] <%jepupu> I like being able to take screenshots on PS4. I dunno how to do it better.
[0:54:32] <Picia000123> its fine

[0:54:34] <%jiggy_snipe> Pat did not want the share button at all
[0:54:39] <%Hawkbone_> IT HAS 4 SELECT BUTTONS
[0:54:44] <+MrAtheGreat> Touchpad doesn’t count as select to me.
[0:54:44] <citerel> i wish the share button was like the switch screenshot button
[0:54:47] <+linSP> it was in the wrong place, switch did it better
[0:54:50] <Camail> yo chill

[0:54:54] <NickHatesSnow> @jiggy_snipe No he said he didn't want it where it was

[0:55:03] <+soFISHticated98> touchpad is de facto select but it's not a dedicated select button
[0:55:05] <+gustavozxd> IN EVERY CASE
[0:55:05] <johnnydalmann> FBCatch L
[0:55:10] <%Rekinsinn> the vita button combo of home + start was great for screenshots
[0:55:12] <%Hawkbone_> There's already 4 more select buttons, Woolie.
[0:55:14] <%Beastman1235_> but gotta share the gameplay FAST
[0:55:14] <%emperordread> Bring back N64 Z trigger
[0:55:15] <%jepupu> But social media is with the days! Gotta have that FaceBook™ button
[0:55:19] <C4m3r0n0409> TOUCHPAD WOOLIE
[0:55:21] <%xcompleasedad> I feel like that that post was bait
[0:55:22] <+gustavozxd> touchpad is more than one button @woolieversus
[0:55:22] <%Beastman1235_> two presses is TOO long
[0:55:24] <+soFISHticated98> like technically the touchpad isn't a select button
[0:55:27] <%BNPhone> Tochpad sucks ass
[0:55:27] <NickHatesSnow> Fuk the touchpad
[0:55:28] <%arkv01> why not swim in blood woolieYE
[0:55:30] <therealtacopancakes> plus the fucking touch button is farther from my thumb than the share one
[0:55:32] <%Superbro64> chatterbox sajamSegue3 sajamSegue4
[0:55:33] <%jiggy_snipe> @NickHatesSnow after Woolie made his stance, Pat does not care for the share button at all
[0:55:37] <+soFISHticated98> it ends up being one but in reality it could just not be a select button depending on the game
[0:55:38] <+Joelexion> I 100% agree with woolie.
[0:55:42] <Camail> touchpad is kinda meh
[0:55:43] <C4m3r0n0409> Cry more
[0:55:44] <+gustavozxd> touchpad is more than 1 button, devs don't use it cause they don't want to
[0:55:50] <+MrAtheGreat> I hate the touchpad select because if it’s dedicated to the map it causes the map to violently lurch whenever you bring it up a la yakuza
[0:55:50] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:55:51] <BlacSoul> Double Tap already has a function
[0:55:52] <Camail> reverse goblins are in full effect
[0:55:53] <%Superbro64> Looks like CHATTERBOX has the goblins huh?
[0:55:55] <lagandcrash> Touch button should be for in game stuff
[0:55:56] <%Superbro64> sajamSegue3 sajamSegue4
[0:55:58] <%Hawkbone_> The touchpad is FOUR select buttons, Woolie.
[0:55:59] <boogaleeboo> I can't believe woolie literally cuts the share button out of his PS4 controllers
[0:55:59] <nepwar> speaking of controller goblins. I hate death stranding map function where you have to touch and tilt to check the topagraphy
[0:56:02] <pennykettle_> The subreddit wants a new controversial gamer topic to yell about each week even if they have to force it
[0:56:05] <+soFISHticated98> Hawkbone we get it
[0:56:06] <%BNPhone> My thing is "I like the SHARE button"
[0:56:06] <+FrenchTact1cs> Select is just touch now, not a big deal
[0:56:06] <Mr_Ease> I mean it was also pat exaggerating it and that being rolled into your discussion
[0:56:07] <+linSP> Touchpad was interesting, but I hope they don’t bring it back
[0:56:07] <+gustavozxd> @mrathegreat ???????
[0:56:07] <OldManDeckardCain> more buttons = easier to play? Stell battlaion wants to know your number LUL
[0:56:10] <+soFISHticated98> stop screaming about the touchpad
[0:56:11] <%CaptainPileDriver> my couch is just filled with deep farts today
[0:56:13] <+Dundee15> 100% agree on the share/shame button.
[0:56:15] <+tearfuldevil> hweres this big crazy breakdown?
[0:56:19] <NickHatesSnow> @jiggy_snipe Yeah but Pat specifically said he likes the idea of a share feature in general just not where it was and even specified the switch as an example
[0:56:27] <Picia000123> @linSP They are literally bringing it back
[0:56:28] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> I love you Woolie
[0:56:29] <%ekodrop> 3
[0:56:29] <+MrAtheGreat> @gustavozxd I too have mind goblins
[0:56:30] <%arkv01> folding @ home STILL exists?
[0:56:39] <pennykettle_> I used to do folding at home with my ps3, felt good even if it doesnt do shit
[0:56:40] <royb2> YEa
[0:56:40] <%ekodrop> it does
[0:56:41] <%Irridium> That was PS3 yeah
[0:56:42] <%optimasmaximas> never heard of this
[0:56:47] <%optimasmaximas> but cool i guess
[0:56:51] <+gustavozxd> obviously the touch function of the touchpad sucks but touchpad is more than 1 button so Woolie is factually wrong
[0:56:52] <%TheOneUpWarrior> The Katamari prince creepin on Minh
[0:56:52] <+ChrisPlaysThing> After working in QA for 6 years, if every buttons does what it says it should and works idgaf
[0:56:53] <%arkv01> I remember using it like 10 years ago
[0:56:56] <%ekodrop> folding @ home killed my ps3
[0:56:59] <%jepupu> SETI@Home was like the original
[0:57:02] <%emperordread> It's the same as bitcoin mining, but for science and not bitcoins
[0:57:03] <%Prevot> so its cryptomining?
[0:57:07] <+MrAtheGreat> I used it once and never again.
[0:57:13] <royb2> Basically a supercomputer that uses normal computers through cloud
[0:57:21] <%andrei11dr> Shit why didn't i get a notification NotLikeThis
[0:57:23] <%optimasmaximas> @WoolieVersus what was the version reggie mentioned?
[0:57:24] <%jepupu> t.35yo boomer
[0:57:28] <pennykettle_> Ive heard of other games like that
[0:57:31] <+gustavozxd> the reason people are going crazy is because Woolie's opinion is based on a lie LUL
[0:57:32] <pennykettle_> or a website
[0:57:49] <%Th3SmartAlec> @andrei11dr we're still at the start
[0:57:49] <%andrei11dr> At least it seems like i didn't miss the salt
[0:57:52] <pennykettle_> Folding at Home is basically bitcoin mining but all your machines are part of a bigger project
[0:57:55] <%Hawkbone_> Woolie is literally just objectively wrong on the share button thing
[0:57:55] <+soFISHticated98> nobody wants to use the touchpad thoug
[0:58:11] <%Hawkbone_> @soFISHticated98 Its literally just a button.
[0:58:13] <FrostedZaibatsu> Pay 60$ to do work because its "cool" >_>
[0:58:13] <+Risingxiv> double tapping the ps button and holding the ps button already have a function . . .
[0:58:15] <lagandcrash> touchpad is greasy with cheeto dust
[0:58:18] <blue2red> HahaLean
[0:58:19] <%BNPhone> It's so cold in the D(okapon) how we ever gunna keep the peace?
[0:58:23] <+Ryu_R> touchpad can stay if the buttons stay
[0:58:24] <pennykettle_> stop using the word objectively like that @Hawkbone_
[0:58:24] <%JetpackMcQuack> Woolie is literally objectively right about the share button
[0:58:26] <+gustavozxd> I like pressing select with my right thumb
[0:58:26] <%TheOneUpWarrior> Sub Daddy rolling through at work
[0:58:27] <+soFISHticated98> it's a button that's 10 times larger than it needs to be
[0:58:27] <%CaptainPileDriver> BLOOD POOOOOOOL
[0:58:30] <+Dustwalker44> woo blood pool!

[0:58:43] <%Th3SmartAlec> One could say that we are invested in the blood pool
[0:58:43] <%The_Timo> So they mentioned the discord, any easy way to get into that? Lol
[0:58:46] <+soFISHticated98> a select button is just better and there's no reason we can't have both

[1:02:30] <+soFISHticated98> stop buying into bits guys
[1:02:33] <%xcompleasedad> You get the bits full out, because we "buy" them from them
[1:02:35] <Teras_ode> Probs striking while the iron's ice cold & people are gonna ResidentSleeper over this, but did anyone already tell woolie about Indivisible Coop & New Game+ update?
[1:02:39] <pennykettle_> You pay the cost upfront, they dont take a cut when they are given. The bits you get are the bits you get @WoolieVersus
[1:02:49] <pennykettle_> Teras_ode yea they saw

[1:14:38] <+Joelexion> d2hSax
[1:14:41] <Riottrio> are slower neck cracks okay? i never throw my neck like that but sometimes ill slowly rotate my head and get aome real satisfying cracks
[1:14:47] <%Hawkbone_> Sorry Minh, but it totally is a scam.
[1:14:48] <%doc_ock_rokc> There are good chiropractors who are doctors and do look at medical records and stuff to help people
[1:14:49] <%fetrigon> Ming's families balls collectively exposed
[1:14:49] <+soFISHticated98> chiropractice is riddled with pseudoscience

[1:15:44] <goldenchaos96> problem is 80% of them arent medically trained
[1:15:46] <+PunJ0hn> @Riottrio just dont throw your neck to pop and relive tension. I did that and actually tore something and literally lost range of motion in part of my neck

[1:16:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> @soFISHticated98 there was one doctor I knew that was a physical therapist that was trying to find what can be used in chiropracty
[1:16:21] <Riottrio> @punj0hn thanks, I'll definitely watch out and not try that if I can't get rid of tension
[1:16:27] <moonologist> to JSTOR
[1:16:30] <%viewtifulr> this will make salt bait
[1:16:41] <%Prevot> its fake news
[1:16:41] <+soFISHticated98> the main technique of chiropractice is already fairly well researched
[1:16:41] <%magiclottie> have they started playing the game yet?
[1:16:42] <%arkv01> you are LITERALLY doubting him LUL
[1:16:46] <+soFISHticated98> it really doesn't do anything
[1:16:53] <+netrac> but a physical therapist is a real thing
[1:16:54] <%jiggy_snipe> Chiropractors appear as expert witnesses in lawsuits which is interesting
[1:16:57] <+soFISHticated98> straight physical therapy is a lot better and carries less risk

[1:17:40] <+soFISHticated98> and why not use just real techniques

[1:18:30] <Brofarian> placebos work, and if you can get the cheapest, least detrimental placebo possible why not?
[1:18:34] <Shishi1205> Big bullshit pseudosciences
[1:18:34] <%Livelinne> But good chyro feels so good tho
[1:18:39] <goldenchaos96> Chiropractor is for symptoms Physical therapy is preventative and treats the issue
[1:18:39] <gryffinp> The big problem is when people try to cure COVID-19 with back cracking

[1:19:05] <jaygee303> Is acupuncture any good?
[1:19:07] <+soFISHticated98> people have actually died. Not a huge amount, but it does carry a risk
[1:19:07] <%arkv01> NTR hypnotism?
[1:19:10] <redrins> that's called placebo
[1:19:12] <+soFISHticated98> no acupuncture is also bs

[1:19:57] <samuraijakanddaxter> acupuncture seems like MASSIVE bullshit
[1:19:59] <%JetpackMcQuack> Hypnotism is actually not placebo
[1:20:01] <+linSP> also don’t tell someone who’s dying that you’ll pray for them
[1:20:03] <MaverickJoker> a physician is the textbook analysts, and the chiropractor is the practice equivalence of it
[1:20:05] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @soFISHticated98

[1:20:38] <MaverickJoker> yo, how's the bloodpool looking?
[1:20:39] <+soFISHticated98> but why pay for a placebo which can be bad for you
[1:20:40] <Xeno351> acupuncture isn't TOTAL bull but most of the people who advertise it are shysters
[1:20:44] <+soFISHticated98> if you can just get the real thing
[1:20:44] <+Amaideus> So just make your own associations and you'll be good
[1:20:45] <nepwar> that was a nice podcast bit
[1:20:45] <%gatorafan> @causewaybob still waiting for Woolie's turn Kappa
[1:20:50] <Teras_ode> I think they say hypnotism depends alot on the person allowing themselves to be hypnotized, subconciously or not
[1:21:02] <3rdRunner> PRESS START TO BLOOD
[1:21:06] <+MrAtheGreat> @teras_ode that’s true
[1:21:07] <aka_Jigawatt> start
[1:21:08] <+soFISHticated98> chiropractice doesn't do anything, chiro on the neck is actually dangerous, and it's not cheap
[1:21:11] <gryffinp> Part of the problem is that the ongoing replication crisis means that EVERYTHING IS BULLSHIT
[1:21:11] <redrins> was there ever an update besides its bullshit

[1:21:13] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 31 minutes
[1:21:14] <%arkv01> I've had acupuncture AND chiropractic work done a bunch, chiropractic adjustments are by far more useful
[1:21:15] <Shishi1205> Science mives at high speeds dont fell bad about it
[1:21:21] <gryffinp> Placebo effect doesn't fucking replicate
[1:21:21] <MassConnect> saying things are bs is bs
[1:21:21] <%Prevot> if alternative medicine worked it wouldn't be alternative
[1:21:28] <nepwar> Remember kids: woolie is just one guy, don't always think he knows the answers
[1:21:31] <+MrAtheGreat> I’ve tried acupuncture. It’s... hard to see the results.

[1:26:37] <Vortigon> awesome LuvBlondeL
[1:26:45] <+soFISHticated98> like my first guess was raiding a stream means a bunch of people "invade" the chat and try to take over the conversation, troll, etc.
[1:26:46] <MattDemers> How we doin' today, manga readers?
[1:26:46] <%andrei11dr> Will hit evo money by the end of this
[1:26:46] <%BNPhone> @WoolieVersus just hit the triggers on the map to auto spot
[1:26:51] <+soFISHticated98> so the name "raid" is just unfortunate
[1:26:51] <Iminari> Hello, how are all of you?
[1:26:53] <+PunJ0hn> someone donate their stimulus check to the bloodpool
[1:26:54] <+HDmexiqtioner> How long does this last usually? The game.
[1:26:58] <%CommanderSqueaks> I had to step away, what's the Bloodpool at?
[1:27:04] <sonofthedeepsouth> DONATE NEET BUX
[1:27:04] <SethKyu> heads up, you can snap to other players on the map using L and R buttons, thought you should know with how big the map is
[1:27:10] <%Hawkbone_> @soFISHticated98 Raiding has been a thing on Twitch since it was called JustinTV
[1:27:12] <%EyeFarted> forest?
[1:27:13] <Varadox> Bloodpool is at 1445.
[1:27:15] <Dhurkst> @soFISHticated98 Not really. Most people think of MMO raids nowadays, as in "we're going to go into this thing as a group and have fun"
[1:27:15] <crimsonsaens> Whenever the boys run low on money they can just do Dokapon streams

[3:31:12] <Infeirno23> they would get punished for not pay attention, not that bad tbh
[3:31:12] <%MaddyCaddy> Chat does not control the game. Let them play.
[3:31:13] <+soFISHticated98> time for more exciting content
[3:31:15] <%Th3SmartAlec> The Wabbit is waiting
[3:31:16] <casualcthulhu11> i want more wabit screen time
[3:31:22] <+Amaideus> And as a result we just had a hype moment with the wabbit
[3:31:24] <%viewtifulr> you cant rely on woolie enough to keep it fair if he can see the chat
[3:31:25] <GoldeNOVA> Chat... NotLikeThis
[3:31:26] <%xcompleasedad> WOOLIE LEFT THE AREA FOR THE RIGHT CAVE
[3:31:26] <%Hawkbone_> @soFISHticated98 They absolutely have not been in the cave for an hour

[3:31:51] <%Th3SmartAlec> Chat, let it ride
[3:31:55] <Infeirno23> the wabbit bopping minh was the funniest thing though @soFISHticated98
[3:31:58] <+Amaideus> Probably another hour or two
[3:32:00] <+soFISHticated98> eh
[3:32:02] <+Dimfish> chat care to shut up?
[3:32:04] <%viewtifulr> also didn't they all get an info dump on the game via emal weeks ago?
[3:32:07] <%JetpackMcQuack> Don't backseat
[3:32:07] <gryffinp> I wouldn't be surprised if woolie snapped and went "WE GOIN ALL NIGHT"
[3:32:08] <%Th3SmartAlec> @crossing_mao As long as is necessary
[3:32:09] <+soFISHticated98> they've been blown out by counter before
[3:32:19] <samuraijakanddaxter> minh entered the cave like 2 turns ago and had a hype moment with wabbit, its not 4 hours of wasted content, jesus
[3:32:20] <zocano> Chat will never not backseat
[3:32:20] <+soFISHticated98> literally anybody can do that
[3:32:23] <%jiggy_snipe> Reggie find the wabbit and do what they couldn't
[3:32:24] <+Amaideus> But it didn't come from the Wabbit
[3:32:24] <+tearfuldevil> LUL
[3:32:26] <%GenesisKnight> How is she here?
[3:32:27] <crossing_mao> Good enough

[3:32:30] <BlkFlameKami> DARKLING WOOLIE
[3:32:32] <%jiggy_snipe> THANK YOU WOOLIE
[3:32:32] <+Amaideus> The Wabbit is a meme enemy for the playthrough
[3:32:34] <%Hawkbone_> @soFISHticated98 Only 8 enemies in the game auto-counter.
[3:32:41] <%Th3SmartAlec> Woolie is tripling down on tricking Minh LUL
[3:32:43] <$Rezca> Woolie wants the princess to DIE
[3:32:45] <+soFISHticated98> it doesn't matter if they auto counter
[3:32:47] <+PunJ0hn> oh SURE mihn
[3:32:49] <zecht89> DARTH POCKETS RISES
[3:32:49] <+soFISHticated98> it just matters if they can
[3:32:49] <3rdRunner> Wabbit is the real protagonist
[3:32:51] <Sol_Install> Minh....
[3:32:51] <+Tarkus110> Violent Woolie
[3:32:51] <GoldeNOVA> Chat keeps feeding Woolie information NotLikeThis
[3:32:53] <+soFISHticated98> tons of enemies do
[3:32:57] <+Amaideus> It's like getting killed by a rival orc on Lord of the Rings and saying "meh, any orc could do that"
[3:32:57] <Infeirno23> @soFISHticated98 literally anybody can go to the other cave too, dont why that is somehow more entertaining
[3:32:58] <+PunJ0hn> mihn is trying to save face
[3:33:00] <JonnyZeFox> Y O M I
[3:33:00] <gryffinp> I'
[3:33:01] <+soFISHticated98> who cares if it's auto
[3:33:01] <%viewtifulr> so lets lie
[3:33:04] <preppyposs> REGGIES IN LAST
[3:33:06] <preppyposs> OH NO
[3:33:07] <%Livelinne> woolieWUT oh no it’s becoming also the Jinro game
[3:33:09] <%Hawkbone_> @soFISHticated98 but barely any have when they go for a strike
[3:33:09] <%BNPhone> bottom right
[3:33:09] <preppyposs> HE HAS A CONTRACT
[3:33:10] <gryffinp> I thought the others CAN see the chat, it's just that woolie reads the most
[3:33:13] <+nintega010> Now woolie is second
[3:33:16] <BurlyBeef> Minh is the late stage ottoman empire
[3:33:18] <+soFISHticated98> so, it'd be bad if it was every time
[3:33:19] <Sedrelic> grape juice
[3:33:21] <+soFISHticated98> it's been a good rate
[3:33:25] <%BNPhone> !! BOTTOM RIGHT !!
[3:33:25] <+craftyraichu> I wonder when assassin bot will return for the doublecross
[3:33:25] <Teras_ode> weren't we supposed to save the princess woolie, just like with Cash? Kappa
[3:33:28] <+soFISHticated98> every once in a while, strike backfires
[3:33:31] <rustedforks> he has to be last for a million turns before he can use the contract
[3:33:33] <glaciusinfinite> OOF
[3:33:34] <samuraijakanddaxter> woolie shouldn't have known it was the wrong cave either, it falls on chat either way
[3:33:35] <+soFISHticated98> which is good for gameplay and good for viewing
[3:33:38] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> wait...is Woolie running to the darkspace
[3:33:42] <+soFISHticated98> because it would suck if they were dead literally all the time
[3:33:42] <%viewtifulr> top left in lava cave
[3:33:43] <Infeirno23> the game is entertaining cause they are, i dont give a shit what they do it in
[3:33:46] <MaverickJoker> woolie doing it again
[3:33:46] <+soFISHticated98> that would not be entertaining
[3:33:49] <%jiggy_snipe> there is an obvious clue to where he's at lol
[3:33:50] <%Hawkbone_> @soFISHticated98 You clearly just don't understand.
[3:33:57] <MaverickJoker> and reggie kept falling for woolie's distraction plays
[3:33:59] <Klefth> It's really good
[3:34:01] <MaverickJoker> LUL
[3:34:01] <+Amaideus> He wants to backseat them to victory I guess
[3:34:05] <+soFISHticated98> oh yes, the intelligent man's argument
[3:34:07] <+That_Mojo> The whole poinnt is they have no idea what is happening in the game right?
[3:34:07] <+Amaideus> Because everyone loves when that happens
[3:34:09] <+soFISHticated98> I just don't agree with you
[3:34:13] <+soFISHticated98> I think your opinion is wrong
[3:34:20] <+pectusumbra> attack danube
[3:34:23] <+soFISHticated98> I don't think what you like is entertaining and that's it
[3:34:24] <%JetpackMcQuack> $1500 on the line man. Don't backseat.
[3:34:25] <gryffinp> i gotta say I don't get what woolie's plan is here
[3:34:25] <%andrei11dr> I had purple corn in a burrito once , it was good
[3:34:26] <%BNPhone> woolie where are you going

[3:34:36] <%CommanderSqueaks> It's dangerously delicious.
[3:34:36] <+Amaideus> Bro, your response multiple times has been "meh" and "who cares"
[3:34:38] <%Hawkbone_> @soFISHticated98 So why are you being a dick about it?
[3:34:41] <+soFISHticated98> you don't have to convince me to be on your side

[4:05:18] <nachohangovers> He can't even use the lost tech
[4:05:19] <Xeno351> lost tech is a waste of a skel key
[4:05:20] <%xcompleasedad> MINH

[4:05:25] <gryffinp> throw the skeleton key away on a piddly starting zone field magic space or no balls
[4:05:25] <%JetpackMcQuack> Cash out
[4:05:26] <+b_aleph> Woolie is losing this game in pursuit of Lost Tech, just like the wabbit
[4:05:28] <+terry_quest> do it
[4:05:28] <fuji_92> yeah, don't go for lost tech woolz, you don't have the pre requisites
[4:05:29] <Shishi1205> are not those cursed?
[4:05:29] <+soFISHticated98> but Minh's a hero
[4:05:33] <xXxDarkk213xXx> Mihn let this man take himself out of the game
[4:05:33] <%emperordread> You've been to the depths of despair, now go to the depths of the ocean and claim your Lost Tech
[4:05:34] <%jiggy_snipe> Minh got his current weapon from a red chest
[4:05:36] <%andrei11dr> Also Reggie could steal the kye from him
[4:05:48] <zocano> Ya Minh’s a hero just like Caim
[4:05:50] <SethKyu> Woolie is like 3 classes before he can use lost tech

[4:06:40] <%magiclottie> DEFINITELY give that to the king
[4:06:44] <Riottrio> Woolie is so close to that Dokapon Nihilism but is using it to be pessimistic.

[4:07:04] <aka_Jigawatt> @xx123manxx true
[4:07:07] <Riottrio> by realising that everything is temporary in Dokapon, you should learn to use what you have when you have it

[4:07:21] <+soFISHticated98> man assigned to guard the princess instead takes her to a casino
[4:07:21] <%emperordread> Rescue Princess -> Go to Vegas -> Vegas Wedding -> Become Dokapon King
[4:07:22] <%Solidnick18> ooooo
[4:07:22] <Riottrio> and realise it's worth giving everything up to make everyone else lose something
[4:07:25] <Sol_Install> holy shit

[4:07:30] <zenith0111> REGGIE IS SO GOOD

[4:07:39] <%Solidnick18> reggie so smart
[4:07:42] <%shaidot> white chesty
[4:07:42] <Shishi1205> GET WEAPONS
[4:07:45] <powerprotoman> thats why you take a white chest
[4:07:46] <%shaidot> white chest
[4:07:46] <%purplehermit12> I would use it on a red chest tbh
[4:07:47] <+soFISHticated98> but she has to go back to being a princess and he has to go back to being a reporter
[4:07:48] <+gutlesscoward> oh man this is gonna be tragedy
[4:07:52] <Riottrio> use it on white chest
[4:07:53] <fuji_92> Woolie don't go for lost tech, you don't have the pre requisites
[4:07:53] <%purplehermit12> or white chest
[4:07:54] <%purplehermit12> white ches

[4:08:03] <+gutlesscoward> don't go for it woolie, not yet
[4:08:06] <+thebeargoesHONK> lost tech is like 2-4 JOBS away
[4:08:19] <gryffinp> It seems like stealing the princess is higher priority right now
[4:08:21] <Riottrio> @fujiwara_92 that colour for your name is so bright on your name
[4:08:21] <%purplehermit12> The lost tech isnt going to be immediately useful for you, you'd have to master both Thief, and Alchemist in order to use it properly @WoolieVersus
[4:08:23] <%andrei11dr> Lost tech is for a class that is FAR away
[4:08:28] <%Th3SmartAlec> camp?
[4:08:30] <+Amaideus> Wait for em boiiii
[4:08:33] <SethKyu> He also needs monk too, right?
[4:08:34] <clueless_reaper> How many weeks are they doing?
[4:08:35] <+soFISHticated98> well thief has been mastered
[4:08:39] <%purplehermit12> Yeah he needs monk
[4:08:40] <+Amaideus> It's story mode
[4:08:42] <Riottrio> Woolie is right though, there is a chance for nothing good to be there
[4:08:43] <%jiggy_snipe> lol
[4:08:44] <+pectusumbra> @clueless_reaper it's story mode
[4:08:45] <sonofthedeepsouth> Woolie feelin like a lesbian heroine in a Rance game Kappa
[4:08:45] <%SuperKirby24> LOL
[4:08:46] <+soFISHticated98> all of them mastered thief
[4:08:47] <3rdRunner> All of them. @clueless_reaper
[4:08:47] <+pectusumbra> and yeyeyeye

[4:09:00] <Infeirno23> i dont want none of that
[4:09:00] <3rdRunner> PRRROMOTION
[4:09:02] <%purplehermit12> No ninjas can use 2 items
[4:09:02] <C4m3r0n0409> What does it do
[4:09:04] <%jiggy_snipe> what's the Ninja ability?
[4:09:04] <+b_aleph> PUNCH EM
[4:09:05] <SethKyu> Ninja can use 2 items per turn
[4:09:08] <aka_Jigawatt> you can use 2 overworld items
[4:09:09] <%BNPhone> You need to master the ???, Monk, Thief, Magician, and Cleric before even being able to USE lost tech @WoolieVersus
[4:09:13] <+MrAtheGreat> Go back to the castle and master another class! Fire Emblem this shit!
[4:09:14] <C4m3r0n0409> OOOO
[4:09:25] <clueless_reaper> @pectusumbra @3rdRunner beauty, thanks team
[4:09:26] <NevikGamina> SEI FAHHH
[4:09:26] <+tearfuldevil> woolies on the monk rotue i think?
[4:09:30] <+kekkerscrew> Double Spinners
[4:09:32] <+tearfuldevil> whats he get from monk
[4:09:42] <+soFISHticated98> I love when the french starts leaking out
[4:09:45] <Shishi1205> Monk should be hype
[4:09:47] <%purplehermit12> Monks are powerhouses
[4:09:54] <+pectusumbra> Woolie has picked a top tier
[4:09:56] <crimsonsaens> It's on the mountain
[4:10:04] <%purplehermit12> they basically get bonus damage when they're low onb health
[4:10:15] <%purplehermit12> berserkers basically
[4:10:16] <Sunfrancisco> I just came in to the stream and for a second I thought Minh was wearing blackface
[4:10:17] <+Amaideus> And Woolie has a ton of HP
[4:10:18] <Infeirno23> go to masadora
[4:10:23] <+Amaideus> That's pretty solid synergy
[4:10:24] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> So hype for monk Pockets if it happens
[4:10:29] <gryffinp> Shadows are nature's blackface
[4:10:30] <SethKyu> Mage can use two nmagics
[4:10:33] <%agumon9000> 2 Field Magics was the magician
[4:10:34] <crimsonsaens> Two items, Magician gets two magics
[4:10:36] <aka_Jigawatt> pockets bout to be a punch girl
[4:10:39] <3rdRunner> I mean woolie was singing a confederate song an hour ago @Sunfrancisco
[4:10:49] <%jiggy_snipe> Nas - Be a Ninja too
[4:11:00] <crimsonsaens> Hero gets one of each
[4:11:03] <%agumon9000> no its not
[4:11:13] <%agumon9000> Its just two items. Magician can use two field magics
[4:11:15] <Shishi1205> rip respawn
[4:11:21] <fuji_92> one of the requisites for lost tech is monk, right?
[4:11:21] <%agumon9000> and a ??? class can use item and magic
[4:11:25] <Teras_ode> good boe
[4:11:35] <+Amaideus> There was some salt in the middle
[4:11:40] <+Amaideus> But we just recently came out of it
[4:11:44] <+Tarkus110> save the super spin for when you get out
[4:11:50] <3rdRunner> Woolie has entered Dokapression @FistOcuffs9
[4:11:50] <Sol_Install> reggie....
[4:11:51] <+paladinstarbuster> @fistocuffs9 very salty

[4:29:33] <Riottrio> which is why everyone said to buy equipment earlier
[4:29:33] <+MrAtheGreat> @agumon9000 I mean, you can lose equipment. Reggie now has an ability specifically designed for that.
[4:29:34] <+pectusumbra> darklings keep their castles and get equpid back after darkling is over. and you can take everyone's towns. better to flip the table than be a loser

[4:44:33] <+InfiniteHav0k> LMAO how long have they been BRB
[4:44:33] <Vortigon> It's fine, woolie can't stab minh when he has the speed ring on
[4:44:34] <Riottrio> Woolie looked back on his dokapon decisions and was turned into a pillar of Salt
[4:44:36] <+PunJ0hn> ah yisss megaman X4 music. that's the best out of the entire series.
[4:44:38] <%purplehermit12> Honestly so much as i want a shame emote for the loser

[4:44:52] <+Amaideus> AY GOOD SHIT REGGIE
[4:44:53] <%RioGascar> How do we know woolie didnt just use reggies phone
[4:44:53] <zocano> Woolie needs to realize that darkling is a better play than his brain is telling him

[4:45:07] <joylent_blue> live your best lives
[4:45:12] <%Irridium> worried we'd come back he'd just not be there LUL
[4:45:14] <Sol_Install> Reggie prove to me
[4:45:16] <+saltysteely> Hoes are indeed mad
[4:45:18] <nepwar> the next emote batch should all be dopakon related
[4:45:18] <@chesterr01> @zocano but he was blocked off the contract
[4:45:18] <Sol_Install> Luck is 100% a skill
[4:45:19] <%purplehermit12> I fucking love that reggie was LITERALLY IN LAST PLACE
[4:45:23] <%purplehermit12> AND SKYROCKETED TO FIRST
[4:45:25] <wendisky> Mario party rules, lose till the end then win
[4:45:26] <%Irridium> fuckin' phased out like that dude next to Stalin
[4:45:28] <%purplehermit12> this is why reggie gangs the best
[4:45:36] <zocano> You can’t lose castles in Dokapon right? They’re hard locked?
[4:45:39] <lessthanhuman_tv> Is the VOD broken for anyone else? around 3:36 it starts skipping segments
[4:45:41] <+Amaideus> I'm agnostic, I'm just here for the chaos
[4:45:45] <%Naho_Saenoki> Darklings can steal castles.
[4:45:45] <+saltysteely> Reggie gotta win after this power play
[4:45:45] <%purplehermit12> pretty sure darkling can take castles @zocano
[4:45:46] <failboat13> Castle Super Beast: Unlimited Salt Works
[4:45:46] <%Livelinne> I need a real shonen redo of this
[4:45:47] <%Double_Tap_That> Reggie rockin'
[4:45:48] <soflicar> Yuo can lose castles
[4:45:49] <jeosadn> The break ends, and the camera fades into Woolie covered in blood, Reggie nowhere to be seen
[4:45:50] <ravenrooke> @lessthanhuman_tv its broken for me too
[4:45:50] <%Irridium> @chesterr01 let the voice of love take you higher
[4:45:51] <SheefEatsBeef> this is all because woolie picked strike
[4:45:53] <+InfiniteHav0k> @zocano only can steal castles while darkling
[4:45:53] <%Livelinne> Mood
[4:45:56] <%andrei11dr> @chesterr01 Are you sure, or is that Woolie tipping with the phone he stole from your corpse
[4:45:58] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> yo what song is this its hype af
[4:46:04] <%purplehermit12> Reggies got 2 castles now
[4:46:05] <Riottrio> @woolieversus just to correct misconceptions, Darklings keep their Castles and equipment, Rust will do nothing except reduced damage if you choose a magical defense option when it is fast
[4:46:07] <JXIalteisen> woolie ga shinda
[4:46:07] <+InfiniteHav0k> or by the king

[4:46:12] <nepwar> Woolie covered in reggie's blood, minh sandbagging the moment
[4:46:12] <Vortigon> RASHIDOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[4:46:13] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> RA SHIII DOOOO
[4:46:14] <MassConnect> this is all because woolie was afraid
[4:46:14] <+Amaideus> @abelincoln_catpuncher It's from MMX4, don't know which track though
[4:46:16] <jevichrono> And Minh looking at peace
[4:46:18] <%RioGascar> So @chesterr01 if we were to use an analogy what character would you say you are in this breaking bad/breaking dokapon show?
[4:46:19] <zenith0111> UNLEASH THE DARK HADO
[4:46:19] <+Kamennoo> @jeosadn right like the seat is empty and woolie acts as if nothing is wrong LUL

[4:46:38] <nepwar> rashidooo
[4:46:38] <3rdRunner> Wow, this mix fucking sucks
[4:46:39] <%purplehermit12> @Riottrio the thing with rust is that It now gives them an excuse to want to/need to click m guard against reggie
[4:46:41] <%Double_Tap_That> REGGIEDOOOOOO
[4:46:41] <%Livelinne> 塩🧂
[4:46:42] <ravenrooke> @lessthanhuman_tv yea they always do. They have to do sync tests all the time
[4:46:49] <zocano> Darkling is the path to victory
[4:46:56] <MassConnect> if it spins, reggie wins
[4:46:58] <Xeno351> if woolie gets lucky enough he can steal all the castles
[4:46:59] <3rdRunner> The DnB version of Rashid's remains the best
[4:46:59] <+saltysteely> Gonna cut back to Woolie covered in blood and Minh/Reggie just gone
[4:47:05] <nepwar> the turbulent wind is actually a sick moniker. i wish that i came up with
[4:47:06] <%andrei11dr> The game will fuck Reggie eventually, it's all just a matter of time
[4:47:07] <%Solidnick18> RASHIDOOOOOOOOOOOOOO duDudu
[4:47:09] <RurouniGeo> darkling is the only way back up to the top for woolie at this point. Both Minh and Reggie have built in win conditions due to stats or spells
