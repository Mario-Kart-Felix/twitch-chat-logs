[0:03:44] <SonicD4> number 1 feature
[0:03:46] <Solidnick18> yep
[0:04:07] <%Valask> Mobas don't have shit figured out capKEK
[0:04:07] <BoneBagMel> I've never seen winter Reggie. Rocking that scarf I see... He does have that teacher vibe
[0:04:28] <@Solidus_113> ideas aren't being shared or stolen when it comes to fighting games
[0:04:28] <nailwind> Reggie killing it today
[0:04:40] <SableS139a> Roolback for fightan seemed more like a Western thing until recently, sadly.
[0:04:40] <%GalacticaPhanto> what if the codes have been on the screen the entire time and we simply haven't open our 3rd eye
[0:04:41] <STINKerton22> Reggie lookin kinda fresh 😳
[0:04:49] <he1lhydra> oh shit, kizzie on the mic? show these scrubs the ky kizzie2Sup
[0:04:58] <SableS139a> @GalacticaPhanto HahaThink
[0:05:03] <nintega010> @neozz13 Yep I that's why I'm ok with yours. lol
[0:05:05] <RodBarrenechea> +R Kizzie Ky is something else
[0:05:10] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @Solidus_113 lotta western players don't really share tech because "It loses their advantage"
[0:05:12] <Solidnick18> yeah
[0:05:21] <SableS139a> Kizzie's Ky is straight learning & swag material.
[0:05:27] <+JustToWatch> YEARS
[0:05:34] <%CaptainPileDriver> nah, MORE ROLLBACK TALK
[0:05:34] <%Valask> I almost went hollow listening to you talk about Rollback
[0:05:36] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Seeing Kizzie getting ganged up on by fLoE and Marn earlier was pretty funny
[0:05:36] <neozz13> @nintega010 Nice, which is your fav then
[0:05:37] <%ZweihanderSteve> And we love you for it!
[0:05:39] <Solidnick18> it's just be a frustration but i get it
[0:05:40] <%CaptainPileDriver> ROLLBACK THE ROLLBACK TALK
[0:05:49] <Skatedeandre> No keep talking
[0:06:00] <nintega010> @neozz13 for me beginning of Rev 2
[0:06:02] <%ZweihanderSteve> KEEP SHOUTING ABOUT ROLLBACK

[0:06:47] <%GalacticaPhanto> Never Back Down: Never stop not backing down
[0:06:49] <@Menitta> So I just had a 300 ping match and it was STILL flawless
[0:06:58] <STINKerton22> thats really sweet
[0:06:59] <SableS139a> Nice, Menitta
[0:07:01] <HelluvaNohbody> Quaduple down on the rollback talk, people need to hear the good word.
[0:07:06] <nintega010> @neozz13 But that is also cause I like YRC better than FRC
[0:07:06] <@Squdnate> @Menitta let me fight you now then
[0:07:06] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:07:15] <@Menitta> ok
[0:07:30] <neozz13> @nintega010 I love how you noted the beginning lol. I really love Rev 2 but like yrc, Danger time, blitz piss me off so much
[0:07:33] <krishendograv3z> I love GG
[0:07:36] <%oxykek> oxykek subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months!
[0:07:53] <@Solidus_113> as fake as can be
[0:08:01] <nintega010> @neozz13 Everybody hates danger time. Even though it led to a funny meme with chip
[0:08:01] <@Solidus_113> time to sit in the audience LUL
[0:08:08] <neozz13> @nintega010 Even though I love all the characters even at the end of rev 2 so much those mechanics bug me so much
[0:08:20] <+JustToWatch> like that time woolie destroyed daigo at evo
[0:08:36] <STINKerton22> yeah that was crazy

[0:09:11] <krishendograv3z> Damn rudeboys
[0:09:14] <neozz13> @nintega010 I’ll also clarify, I don’t have much of a problem with blitz, it’s the blitz charge
[0:09:35] <krishendograv3z> Mushing up da place
[0:09:41] <andre11dr> That's great an all...but i don't think a westerner has ever made top 8 in evo in GG games LUL

[0:12:18] <@Solidus_113> there was a regular versus mode in Overture
[0:12:19] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> majinoNinjuh
[0:12:23] <RodBarrenechea> I know NOTHING about overture
[0:12:25] <RedHotBoss> gettin that first valentine in
[0:12:27] <huskarl_zap> BRIDGET OR NO BALLS
[0:12:28] <RodBarrenechea> other than story
[0:12:42] <+SenpaiSamui> kizzie2Kizziepls kizzie2Kizziepls kizzie2Kizziepls
[0:12:44] <RodBarrenechea> dude I wanna play it now
[0:12:47] <+MTLxSpider> 1frame is good enough
[0:13:02] <SableS139a> Overture's fucking weird gameplay-wise, but it has a metric fuckton of plot you can't miss out on if you're a GG lorefiend.
[0:13:03] <%Irridium> never really played the game so I'm excited to get bodied
[0:13:12] <+McSoliace> 1 frame is typically fine
[0:13:27] <RodBarrenechea> @sables139a yeah I know the lore but not from actually playing it
[0:13:27] <jorniev> all i now about this game is the woolie lore video, sol looking awesome and that is it
[0:13:30] <+McSoliace> but 2 for bad connections for sure
[0:13:52] <@Solidus_113> SourPls
[0:13:57] <+pim1000> wait is woolie playing on pad???
[0:13:57] <+Deko_> the delay in the select screen is so baad LUL
[0:13:58] <andre11dr> So this game, Kliff and Justice are PROBLEMS, Johnny is has no weaknesses except that every match up is 5-5 or 6-5 in his favor, that's the main meta ,but everyone has something broken
[0:14:07] <+clauswasazombie> could I get a game in? I'm from Brazil and I play Slayer
[0:14:07] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:14:12] <Solidnick18> SourPls
[0:14:16] <%Josef_Stryker> So this is just a labbing session tonight?
[0:14:28] <%ZweihanderSteve> GG2 is what got me into GG LUL
[0:14:33] <SableS139a> @RodBarrenechea Think of an RTS mixed with an action game and some fighting game mechanics. It's a strange blend from what I've seen considering I've never personally touched it.
[0:14:38] <Vermillion129> It’s a bodied session i think LUL
[0:14:43] <RodBarrenechea> that sounds interesting
[0:14:43] <Zezinizzle> do combo
[0:14:49] <Solidnick18> lol
[0:14:50] <RodBarrenechea> i like all of those words
[0:14:50] <+Deko_> jesus LUL
[0:14:52] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Order Sol woolieDATTEBAYO
[0:14:54] <SableS139a> Reload was what got me into the series, and I was 6 at the time.
[0:14:57] <SableS139a> W E L P
[0:15:02] <Equirah> LUL
[0:15:10] <Solidnick18> thanks order sol
[0:15:15] <HereComestheChief> Jebaited
[0:15:16] <RadShiro> KIZZIE KAY? I KNOW THQAT GUY
[0:15:21] <andre11dr> @clauswasazombie Slayer mains ,gather up and let's pray we get him back quick for Strive <3
[0:15:33] <+pectusumbra> F i g h t i n g G a m e s in a nutshell
[0:15:38] <+clauswasazombie> @andre11dr I think they know how cool he is
[0:15:44] <%GalacticaPhanto> @andre11dr I mean Nagoriyuki is pretty much new Slayer
[0:15:44] <duskfeather6578> BigPhish BigPhish
[0:15:45] <+clauswasazombie> He'll be dlc probably tho
[0:15:46] <+Brunocarvalhoc> is it for glory?
[0:15:49] <SableS139a> I still need to get the hang of Order Sol. I wanna rock his shit like nothing else.
[0:15:52] <SonicD4> beta will be beta
[0:15:57] <+clauswasazombie> @GalacticaPhanto he has a very different playstyle imo
[0:16:15] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus the streams this week have been great and this one is one i've been looking forward to, thanks for this
[0:16:21] <@Solidus_113> Overture was the originally what GG was going to be, but PS1 couldn't handle it
[0:16:25] <andre11dr> @galacticaphanto I mean not really except for the fact that he's a vampire
[0:16:35] <+clauswasazombie> he looks like more of a zoner with big buttons, not a ch boxer @GalacticaPhanto
[0:17:09] <%GalacticaPhanto> that's what I was referring to. should have been more specific
[0:17:21] <%AlteisenReiseZ> I just want Johnny back in Strive
[0:17:29] <+AsinPersuasion> kizzie is speaking my language
[0:17:29] <%AlteisenReiseZ> IZUNA NEEDS HIS TIME TO SHINE
[0:17:41] <+AsinPersuasion> im so sad that sin wasn't an instalock for strive
[0:17:41] <SableS139a> Izuna's fucking dope and I wanna see him come back
[0:17:42] <RodBarrenechea> Izuna is sick
[0:17:42] <LoadingFWANK> cat man big import
[0:17:51] <andre11dr> Slayer i kinda like a super rush down, that if you let him get tension, he can do actually 100% combos
[0:17:55] <RodBarrenechea> Doubt Paradigm will ever be playable
[0:18:01] <@Solidus_113> Paradigm is too busy being a nerd to fight
[0:18:06] <%CaptainPileDriver> is this the guilty gear with the giant stupid monster in it?
[0:18:09] <%GalacticaPhanto> Please Daiskuke let my boy Zappa come back please
[0:18:13] <justachap> Bacon
[0:18:14] <+OroOreo> @CaptainPileDriver nah thats isuka
[0:18:17] <RyuuAoi> What is this shlock!?
[0:18:18] <%CaptainPileDriver> okay
[0:18:20] <Solidnick18> colors on deck
[0:18:27] <Vendigear> nice burst
[0:18:28] <+OroOreo> lets go kizzie
[0:18:28] <SableS139a> Yeah, Doc's probably never gonna be playable past Overture and it kinda hurts.
[0:19:04] <andre11dr> Order Sol got nerfed in +R and he can still just maule you if he gets charge
[0:19:23] <Vendigear> Woolie is doing way better than I could've expectede
[0:19:33] <SableS139a> Wait, you mean to tell me that Order Sol's less of a threat now than he used to be?
[0:19:39] <andre11dr> But he was kinda broken before, more AC newcomers were
[0:19:44] <+OroOreo> i actually think counter hit is a little too small no joke
[0:19:51] <STINKerton22> Baiken seems fun i should try her sometime
[0:20:05] <SableS139a> @andre11dr Oh... Well shot, I've been dodging bullets in Survival Mode then...
[0:20:08] <%GenericSoda> Is woolie hosting a public room or is there a password in place?
[0:20:09] <@Solidus_113> where's the IAD Tatami
[0:20:28] <andre11dr> Just not in XRd @stinkerton22
[0:20:32] <SableS139a> @STINKerton22 Bonus in your case, Baiken's the 2nd best character in the game right now. Just behind Testament & above Zappa.
[0:20:48] <TarWitch_Kyuss> Charge burst is CH punishable.
[0:20:50] <Kiaayo> fighting game releases confuse me, this was the best version of guilty gear before xrd came out, right?
[0:20:51] <STINKerton22> Oh yeah im aware of xrd baiken
[0:20:57] <RodBarrenechea> I still don't get how baiken can summon fucking tatamis
[0:20:58] <SableS139a> @Kiaayo Yessir
[0:21:02] <RodBarrenechea> ki lets ya do that
[0:21:06] <RodBarrenechea> okay then

[0:21:25] <Vengie14> Is that Kizzie Kay?
[0:21:28] <%GenericSoda> @Kiaayo yeah, but Accent Core (vanilla) is more favored in Japanese arcades because of release dates. It was in arcades for serveral years and +R was sort of undercut by Xrd's release
[0:21:31] <@Solidus_113> there's character guides all over the Steam Guides list
[0:21:32] <SableS139a> @Vengie14 Yessir
[0:21:34] <fernandapsdois> it is kizzie
[0:21:36] <Vengie14> nice
[0:21:44] <andre11dr> Back when RC Tatami was mad busted
[0:21:44] <Solidnick18> i wanna see some soul snatching
[0:21:46] <%CaptainPileDriver> for real, if there are any real testament players in chat, i wanna see woolie get bodied like it's mankind vs undertaker in the hell in the cell

[0:22:47] <andre11dr> People forgot
[0:22:50] <%GenericSoda> Bridget is still bottom in +R, but +R's tier list is VERY compressed. The top 3 are nowhere near as dominant as they were in AC vanilla
[0:22:58] <@Squdnate> I'm hosting a lobby to jam some +R while watching this if anybody wanna join. Single, Pass PSSPPP
[0:23:10] <zander231294> So what are the top 3 characters in GGXXAC+R?
[0:23:12] <+Deko_> thats messed up LUL
[0:23:16] <FrostedZaibatsu> Damn. i like that
[0:23:23] <TeethMuncher> @zander231294 zappa, testament, baiken
[0:23:23] <%GenericSoda> top 3 are Testament, Zappa, and Baiken
[0:23:30] <andre11dr> @zander231294 Kliff is definitely one
[0:23:32] <SableS139a> @Zezinizzle Testament, Baiken, and Zappa in that order
[0:23:38] <%mistspade> mistspade subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months!
[0:23:41] <+Koover> iirc tiers are pretty compressed in +r
[0:23:52] <RyuuAoi> Fuck. Baiken is sick.
[0:24:07] <%GenericSoda> @GenericSoda She's about creating space/getting a knockdown and going into Moroha. If she gets a knockdown she uses a command grab, if she's far away she uses one of three blood packs she starts with
[0:24:08] <SableS139a> Compressed tiers are always the best ones.
[0:24:08] <Zayasu> LUL
[0:24:08] <+Deko_> cut your arms LUL
[0:24:09] <TeethMuncher> @andre11dr in +R? hell no he ain't
[0:24:12] <+CelebrityGhost> is Faust still bugged in the beta?
[0:24:12] <Solidnick18> LUL
[0:24:26] <FeltSn0wman> HS lock disables throws and throw techs ukogWashed
[0:24:30] <+ottermusprime2773> You can make your next attack unblockable with her
[0:24:31] <Solidnick18> oh man
[0:24:31] <+pim1000> anji PogChamp
[0:24:31] <mirtosss> Ohh you playing against Kizzie? PogChamp
[0:24:31] <Tennochief> YEYEYYEEYYE
[0:24:31] <snow_soldier> The Anji???
[0:24:32] <andre11dr> Oh wait, yes im thinking of AC original
[0:24:37] <Solidnick18> woolie hates him
[0:24:39] <snow_soldier> You been holding back on the Kizzingtons
[0:24:41] <+b_aleph> Woolie's favorite
[0:24:43] <Solidnick18> LUL
[0:24:46] <SableS139a> Oh no, it's Guard Point the Character
[0:24:50] <SableS139a> I'm scared
[0:24:51] <%GenericSoda> @GenericSoda every time she lands an attack (hit or block) in Moroha mode she loses health, but when she transitions back to normal mode she gains health back proportional to what she dealt
[0:24:52] <@Solidus_113> Forever salty
[0:24:55] <+MTLxSpider> Anji is godlike
[0:24:56] <+OroOreo> plus on block the character
[0:24:58] <delerim001> time for butterflies
[0:24:58] <%Reverend_Roscoe> Woolie Jealous
[0:25:03] <%GenericSoda> Anji is sick, Woolie is just hating
[0:25:03] <+jiggy_snipe> Kappa
[0:25:06] <he1lhydra> show us the horizontal dp kizzie
[0:25:07] <RodBarrenechea> Woolie loves Anji
[0:25:16] <@Solidus_113> look at this lovers quarrel
[0:25:18] <SableS139a> I love Anji, but he scares the shit out of me
[0:25:19] <@Solidus_113> Kappa
[0:25:21] <%CaptainPileDriver> i'm so interested in what his gameplay is gonna be in strive
[0:25:23] <FeltSn0wman> anji has a bigger rack than may does lmao
[0:25:27] <SableS139a> @Solidus_113 LUL
[0:25:27] <%Reverend_Roscoe> FUCK FIGHT, FUCK FIGHT!
[0:25:35] <nailwind> Anji tickles my aesthetic
[0:25:39] <neozz13> @squdnate Fine I’m in
[0:25:40] <andre11dr> Im fine with Anji, don't hate him,don't love him
[0:25:49] <BoneBagMel> Look at this woolie
[0:25:49] <RodBarrenechea> I want anji's titties to envelop me in a loving embrace
[0:25:51] <BoneBagMel> playing his waifu
[0:25:52] <STINKerton22> that projectile looks fucked up i love it
[0:26:00] <%GenericSoda> honestly the impression that Anji and Baiken are a pair doesn't feel right to me, it's more like he's looking out for her because of their shared heritage
[0:26:04] <%barkon345> im really hoping the y bring Testament to strive
[0:26:07] <SableS139a> Why can't Anji be my dad?
[0:26:07] <%CaptainPileDriver> look at those big man tiddies
[0:26:08] <FeltSn0wman> playing hwa in kofXIII was like a tk dp trial by fire lmao
[0:26:10] <jorniev> oh thats the fuck boy?
[0:26:14] <+VersusOmnibus> Good to see I have not missed Woolie playing his waifu.
[0:26:26] <+b_aleph> Is this for glory? There's a guest...
[0:26:33] <%CaptainPileDriver> yes
[0:26:34] <UTaken34> it is
[0:26:34] <STINKerton22> unregulated waifu cockfighting
[0:26:35] <FeltSn0wman> @CaptainPileDriver got more schmeat up there than may does lmao
[0:26:40] <neozz13> @genericsoda Wait where’d you hear they were a pair
[0:27:00] <+pim1000> wait but why is woolie playing on pad?
[0:27:01] <TeethMuncher> downloaded
[0:27:02] <%barkon345> yea arent Biken and Anji like the last two remaining Japanese people on the planet?
[0:27:03] <+OroOreo> sajamGasm

[0:27:06] <Solidnick18> LUL
[0:27:07] <%CaptainPileDriver> MMMMMM
[0:27:07] <zecht89> LUL LUL LUL
[0:27:08] <Tennochief> NICE
[0:27:08] <%GenericSoda> It's what everybody says, I don't think it's ever been outright stated
[0:27:11] <he1lhydra> AUTO GUARD
[0:27:16] <FeltSn0wman> not rly theres one colony of japanese ppl but there arent a lot
[0:27:16] <%GenericSoda> @OroOreo oh youre a sajam fan now??
[0:27:17] <neozz13> @barkon345 May
[0:27:24] <LegendGHT> I think May is Japanese
[0:27:27] <FeltSn0wman> she is
[0:27:29] <RodBarrenechea> Fuck baiken/anji as a ship fr
[0:27:32] <+OroOreo> @GenericSoda man i hate this kid sajam sajamSegue3 sajamSegue4
[0:27:36] <+Aheg0d> Man Baiken should be with Woolie not Anji she deserves better Kappa
[0:27:37] <+PixLPaintBrush24> @barkon345 No, that's what the colonies are for
[0:27:39] <SableS139a> @barkon345 They're so far the last significant ones we see alongside May, Izuna, and that one shrine maiden chick from the GG Xtra manga.
[0:27:40] <%GenericSoda> sajamDegen
[0:27:49] <FeltSn0wman> baiken/dead gears is the only valid pair
[0:27:56] <LegendGHT> Baiken can just date May SeemsGood
[0:28:02] <%GenericSoda> There are a couple different Japanese colonies spread out all over the world iirc
[0:28:14] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> May is chinese, but that does count as asian
[0:28:15] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:28:18] <RodBarrenechea> Baiken probably doesn't give a shit at all about shit
[0:28:22] <%GenericSoda> I follow a little of GG's lore but there's a whole lot I don't know
[0:28:22] <neozz13> Literally never heard Baiken and Anji were a thing till now
[0:28:23] <+VersusOmnibus> @legendght Uh... How old is May again?
[0:28:31] <+Yamchadassist> i thought may was japanese?
[0:28:32] <+OroOreo> scoops hagaan daz
[0:28:35] <puffntmd> 23
[0:28:35] <+PixLPaintBrush24> 23?
[0:28:36] <RodBarrenechea> @kosorsomesaykosm_ pretty sure May is japanese dude
[0:28:37] <LegendGHT> over 18 that's all that matters
[0:28:43] <Tennochief> She's legal in Japanese years
[0:28:47] <+b_aleph> ArcSys lore is all over the place
[0:28:48] <salttea66> @yamchadassist she is
[0:28:52] <FeltSn0wman> ya may is like 20-smth which is why shes a johnny simp
[0:28:53] <%GenericSoda> but yeah, Anji is sick, he's a fuckin gorilla
[0:28:53] <Vinsfeld13> May is above 20
[0:28:54] <+Aheg0d> May is (insert age in country)
[0:28:55] <+VersusOmnibus> @legendght Kay, just making sure
[0:28:56] <jorniev> anji and baiken are thing!?
[0:28:57] <RodBarrenechea> she's whatever age you need her to be in your country
[0:28:58] <+ottermusprime2773> I'd play eddie if I had the brain power
[0:28:58] <andre11dr> @versusomnibus Whatever you country needs Kappa
[0:29:00] <SableS139a> @VersusOmnibus May's in her very 30s at this point, if I'm right. Japanese folks age slowly physically in GG for whatever reason.
[0:29:12] <FeltSn0wman> probably bc of Ki
[0:29:15] <%Reverend_Roscoe> 20s
[0:29:16] <%barkon345> isnt almost everyone near s class in this game
[0:29:17] <+zepelinnn1> i dont get wjy peeps keep memeing about May's age like small adults dont exist
[0:29:18] <Vinsfeld13> @SableS139a Maybe because of Ki?
[0:29:20] <Tennochief> That's due to Ki
[0:29:22] <%Eaglestrike117> Is this a lovers quarral right now?
[0:29:24] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @RodBarrenechea nope, chinese
[0:29:26] <+Yamchadassist> @SableS139a "for watever reason" Kappa
[0:29:27] <FeltSn0wman> bc Kliff knew how to use ki and he lived forever
[0:29:36] <%CaptainPileDriver> anji is mid a tier
[0:29:41] <OldManDeckardCain> japan was epstein's island in gg universe Kappa
[0:29:42] <%CaptainPileDriver> according to dusloop
[0:29:42] <+AsinPersuasion> doesn't anji have guard point?
[0:29:45] <SableS139a> Probably. Ki's absolutely fucking busted in GG if you have the potential to use it.
[0:29:50] <Major_Porkins> This game looks so beautiful dude
[0:29:55] <jorniev> that dude needs a shirt
[0:29:57] <%GenericSoda> An Anji player actually won EVO JP this year so there's a bunch of footage you can find to help figure him out
[0:29:57] <+AsinPersuasion> @CaptainPileDriver the tier list on dustloop isn't organized within a tier
[0:29:58] <+VersusOmnibus> @zepelinnn1 I can’t speak for everybody else, but I genuinely didn’t know
[0:30:00] <+AsinPersuasion> fyi
[0:30:01] <+Koover> @AsinPersuasion yeah he has guardpoints on his specials iirc
[0:30:02] <TeethMuncher> Hoping to see some Pot and Justice tonight. Need that big body rep going.
[0:30:04] <%CaptainPileDriver> fair enough
[0:30:06] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @RodBarrenechea she even speaks in broken japanese
[0:30:09] <LegendGHT> she's Japanese it's on the wiki
[0:30:10] <RodBarrenechea> Wiki says japan my man @kosorsomesaykosm_
[0:30:14] <Vinsfeld13> @Major_Porkins Basically, a strong Ki user can cheat death
[0:30:16] <RodBarrenechea> you're thinking of Jam
[0:30:23] <gordieda20> That's Jam
[0:30:25] <RodBarrenechea> Jam is chinese and speaks broken japanese
[0:30:28] <FeltSn0wman> i really wanna learn justice but gotdam she's hard
[0:30:30] <+Koover> kliff can use ki as well
[0:30:32] <SableS139a> Degen Justice shenanigans and gorilla Sol play is needed tonight.
[0:30:36] <@Menitta> Jam is awesome, but I hate her moveset
[0:30:42] <+the22cstomp> i wanna see some a.b.a play
[0:30:51] <+ottermusprime2773> @SableS139a that's what I'm here for
[0:30:51] <SableS139a> @Koover First westerner to master Ki usage if I'm correct.
[0:30:55] <salttea66> may doesn't use ki
[0:30:56] <+Koover> ye
[0:30:57] <FeltSn0wman> ive mostly been learning robo ky tho
[0:30:58] <%GenericSoda> WOW that was a nice chicken block
[0:30:59] <@Menitta> Millia will always be my girl
[0:31:01] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @RodBarrenechea ....I AM thinkng of May. Look, being a Jam main induces brain rot, learn from my mistake
[0:31:04] <LegendGHT> They need to bring back Bridget for me
[0:31:07] <%barkon345> @Major_Porkins yea and think about what it was like playing this game in the early 2000s. this was one of the most beautiful fighting game around at the time
[0:31:07] <+JohnMarkley> hello everyone o/
[0:31:17] <Vinsfeld13> Uh oh
[0:31:20] <Solidnick18> terresa's jam monkaS
[0:31:23] <+Rifts_Salt> HELLO CHAT AND wOOLIE
[0:31:24] <RodBarrenechea> No dude, May is japanese lol, Jam is the one with the broken japanese dude
[0:31:25] <SableS139a> @Menitta It'll be Dizzy & Elphelt for me, even if I can't Dizzy for shit
[0:31:27] <townzzzzz> time to stun edge
[0:31:27] <+Yamchadassist> jam is dope but fuck charging medals or whatever lmao
[0:31:29] <LegendGHT> Everyone's gay for Bridget
[0:31:31] <MidnightPacif1c> gweedo seva
[0:31:31] <FeltSn0wman> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ this is true i watched a jam main play sol and he popped dragon install every round
[0:31:35] <pistofficer> baiken got that donk
[0:31:37] <@Menitta> Dizzy is some shit
[0:31:37] <+OroOreo> @Yamchadassist thats the best part
[0:31:38] <SableS139a> Ayy, it's Kizzie Ky time
[0:31:38] <+ottermusprime2773> Ky had grinders in Xrd, now he feels extra white bread
[0:31:40] <@Solidus_113> I'm so glad people know about the belts now
[0:31:45] <%GenericSoda> I feel like Anji being the only X character that didn't get into Xrd being brought in for Strive, we're going to see an XX character in Strive as well. My money's on Robo-Ky or Zappa.
[0:31:59] <LegendGHT> isn't Zappa already confirmed?
[0:32:05] <%GenericSoda> not yet
[0:32:08] <FeltSn0wman> zappa was in xrd story mode
[0:32:09] <Tennochief> Zappa's gone for now due to Faust
[0:32:10] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @RodBarrenechea see, we have one braincell and we all gotta share it
[0:32:18] <%GenericSoda> I'd LOVE to see how Zappa animates in 3D though
[0:32:19] <Vinsfeld13> Zappa in charge of the ghosts? One can dream
[0:32:20] <+VersusOmnibus> How’s the netcode? I’ve heard good things?
[0:32:26] <+MTLxSpider> guardcancel so cheap
[0:32:26] <andre11dr> I-No should definitely be in Strive
[0:32:27] <+Koover> COCONUTS
[0:32:28] <%Eaglestrike117> Netcodes good
[0:32:31] <%barkon345> @GenericSoda um testament didn't make into xrd
[0:32:32] <SableS139a> @ottermusprime2773 Dude, imagine Ky with grinders and his extra bullshit from Accent Core.
[0:32:32] <+projectmanatees> But what if we get Bridget PogChamp
[0:32:36] <+Goblin01> helll yeah my first real intro into fighting games. <3
[0:32:38] <RodBarrenechea> 1: I'm not a Jam main, 2: are ya trolling me? @kosorsomesaykosm_
[0:32:41] <%Eaglestrike117> Ive been playin with american dudes from EU with only 2 frames of delay
[0:32:45] <%GenericSoda> @VersusOmnibus dude I played a friend in Spain from east coast US the other day and it was CLEAN. It's like a dream
[0:32:46] <%Eaglestrike117> and its been perfect
[0:32:48] <RodBarrenechea> from the wiki: "May lost her home and parents (who she has no memory of) at a young age. Her real name and identity unknown, she is Japanese"
[0:32:54] <LegendGHT> Woolie I know you adjusted your lighting for maximum cool but I can't see shit of you guys
[0:33:01] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @RodBarrenechea oh, by we I meant Jam mains
[0:33:08] <+VersusOmnibus> @eaglestrike117 @genericsoda PogChamp
[0:33:09] <+ottermusprime2773> @SableS139a that sounds like a nightmare. there was a pint in xrd where ky was mad good
[0:33:09] <%jinking79> damnit Twitch notifications
[0:33:22] <%AlteisenReiseZ> God, I missed these dust attacks
[0:33:25] <%AlteisenReiseZ> they're so dirty
[0:33:27] <+Deko_> really sick
[0:33:39] <andre11dr> I-No ,Venom and Slayer are the "Why the fuck are these people not in?" Caracters
[0:33:40] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @RodBarrenechea clearly today is not my turn with the braincell
[0:33:43] <skewerstar> Man, can we at least get Baiken confirmed for Strive before talking about other people!?
[0:33:45] <%GenericSoda> @barkon345 We don't have a single XX character so far though, that's why I think it's the two I mentioned. Bridget and ABA are my longshot bets
[0:33:47] <driveljam> hey gamers
[0:33:48] <Solidnick18> nice
[0:34:00] <driveljam> any kliff tonight?
[0:34:01] <skewerstar> Just to complete the world warriors?
[0:34:07] <LegendGHT> @WoolieVersus can you turn some lights on so we can see you guys
[0:34:09] <STINKerton22> Ky seems kinda swag am I mistaken?
[0:34:10] <FeltSn0wman> her xrd corner loops work
[0:34:11] <SableS139a> @ottermusprime2773 It's a nightmare unless you play this theoretical Ky. But at least it's not Beta Robo-Ky/Zombie Ky from GGX Plus or EX Ky. Now they're problems in the making no matter how fun they are.
[0:34:26] <nailwind> show us magic Reggie
[0:34:30] <Suwaiya> is it jsut me or is the stream in 480p
[0:34:37] <zecht89> whaaa? baiken has a ton of combos
[0:34:38] <Solidnick18> who reggie playing
[0:34:41] <andre11dr> But would actually like Jack-O back because degeneracy
[0:34:43] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> oh no, pure boy reggie gonna get devoured
[0:34:47] <300coolfactsaboutbears> Oh shit it's Kizzie.
[0:34:48] <TeethMuncher> @Suwaiya it's you
[0:34:54] <+b_aleph> Plot twist: Reggie is the one bringing in the glory
[0:34:56] <RodBarrenechea> I want Aria in Strive
[0:34:56] <+VersusOmnibus> Press F for Reggie
[0:34:59] <RodBarrenechea> pls
[0:35:00] <Vinsfeld13> EX chars are really busted?
[0:35:01] <LegendGHT> the blacklight is overblowing them
[0:35:02] <Vendigear> b-but we have Kick Vanessa
[0:35:18] <STINKerton22> oh look the best theme in the game
[0:35:18] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:35:24] <RodBarrenechea> Kick Vanessa aka the source of my impending character crisis
[0:35:25] <%Irridium> so I spent a bit playing Zappa. Zappa's pretty cool. I would like him to come back.
[0:35:25] <SableS139a> @Vinsfeld13 Some are, others are okay and interchangeable with the normal versions, and others aren't all that great.
[0:35:27] <huskarl_zap> Bridget or NO BALLS
[0:35:28] <%GenericSoda> I don't know if EX characters are busted, they're just WEIRD. Slayer's Dandy follow-ups are special moves and he's a rekka character
[0:35:30] <+VersusOmnibus> !uptime
[0:35:30] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 42 minutes and 35 seconds
[0:35:31] <%GenericSoda> in EX

[0:35:43] <+VersusOmnibus> !MOTIVATED

[0:35:52] <Vinsfeld13> Got it
[0:35:54] <SableS139a> EX Sol, Ky, Dizzy, and Order Sol are insanely fun from my experience.
[0:35:56] <%CaptainPileDriver> fuck yeah he is
[0:36:04] <+Koover> HOS theme is da bomb
[0:36:05] <andre11dr> Testament is a really interesting play style
[0:36:10] <%barkon345> @barkon345 yea but you said that Anji was the only gg x character that didn't make it into xrd and saying that you Testament was another gg x character that didn't make it into xrd
[0:36:10] <+Chronoreyer> only p1 controller gets recognized in netplay
[0:36:24] <skewerstar> Oh shit yeah... Testament needs to be brought back too!
[0:36:26] <+MTLxSpider> prolly gotta unplug your pad
[0:36:28] <%GenericSoda> @barkon345 Testament debuted in the original game
[0:36:30] <%Creggamonsta> reggie looking good in the scarf
[0:36:34] <SableS139a> Hell, EX Order Sol plays almost exactly like Sol does in The Missing Link, complete with the impact for dashing as a Dash attack for HOS.
[0:36:35] <nintega010> Ya'll who want Testament back is evil.
[0:36:50] <SableS139a> @nintega010 I don't see the problem here Kappa
[0:36:50] <nintega010> *are
[0:36:53] <%barkon345> testament needs to be back in strive
[0:36:57] <andre11dr> I actually like Grave Digger Testament version more, i would rather they bring back that moveset
[0:37:00] <stardustcrusad3r> when the next guilty pear video out it was fye
[0:37:04] <+Koover> not necessarily, beautifuldude plays eddie on pad and does great
[0:37:11] <SableS139a> Give us our boy Testament back
[0:37:11] <%GenericSoda> Testament is evil until you knock him down and throw a handful of butterflies at him while he's on the ground
[0:37:16] <+DizzyGunner> GG on pad is ass
[0:37:18] <RodBarrenechea> Beautifuldude plays on pad?????
[0:37:22] <RodBarrenechea> oh my god
[0:37:28] <RodBarrenechea> his brain is even bigger than I thought
[0:37:29] <TeethMuncher> If you want instant Youzan's, a hitbox is the way to go
[0:37:34] <+b_aleph> Testament is never coming back, accept it
[0:37:34] <%GenericSoda> Eddie on pad sounds WILD
[0:37:35] <macmens> wait is pad just bad for this game?
[0:37:37] <%barkon345> Testament is one of the sickest characters in this game
[0:37:37] <FeltSn0wman> when is arcsys gonna stop being a bunch of cowards and bring back sol's sidewinder
[0:37:38] <Vinsfeld13> A good fightpad can help you aout
[0:37:40] <Vinsfeld13> out*
[0:37:40] <nintega010> @DizzyGunner unless your lostsol
[0:37:42] <LegendGHT> Woolie can you turn on some front lights or something? the backlights are making you guys appear as shadows and it's really hard to see when you're minimized to play
[0:37:49] <FeltSn0wman> Shin Tatami on pad ukogCringe
[0:37:59] <+DizzyGunner> nintega010 more talking about my self each to their own
[0:38:06] <%GenericSoda> @macmens it really depends. Personally I think playing Eddie on pad would be difficult because he requires holding down buttons and stuff
[0:38:07] <neozz13> Guarantee everyone who says whatever fighter on ass doesn’t know what they’re talking about
[0:38:19] <SableS139a> @Vinsfeld13 Facts. Mad Cats & Logitech have been really good in those regards.
[0:38:20] <nintega010> @DizzyGunner oh. no problem
[0:38:21] <+zepelinnn1> XX Ino monkaS
[0:38:25] <driveljam> i have yet to successfully approach Testament
[0:38:25] <%GenericSoda> I like this weird Kakyoin color for Testament
[0:38:27] <LegendGHT> or nah lol
[0:38:27] <+Just_Quinn> am i the only one who just wants the whole roster of accent core plus r in strive plus all the new characters
[0:38:35] <huskarl_zap> Jotaro? PogChamp
[0:38:35] <Dhurkst> Kax is KizzieKay, right?
[0:38:35] <andre11dr> Ok Reggie start running around and placing shit
[0:38:38] <+Ganmorg> oml
[0:38:39] <SableS139a> @Vinsfeld13 Hell, their pads spoiled me to the point where I only play fightan on PC.
[0:38:44] <+Ganmorg> Woolie isn't playing Baiken?
[0:38:54] <Vinsfeld13> @SableS139a I have a Hori one
[0:38:56] <+ottermusprime2773> Testament barely got anything on defense
[0:38:56] <RodBarrenechea> @just_quinn More characters = better, it's just not happening dude
[0:39:04] <+Terrarp> anyone up for some games in the meantime?
[0:39:04] <andre11dr> Looks like Reggie won't get to play the game LUL
[0:39:05] <huskarl_zap> he farted?
[0:39:10] <zecht89> never let a o-sol charge lol
[0:39:14] <RyuuAoi> Let that man breathe!
[0:39:20] <%GenericSoda> Testament has a countermove, but I think he can be thrown out of it
[0:39:27] <@Solidus_113> wow that's jank
[0:39:33] <+Ganmorg> whack
[0:39:39] <+zepelinnn1> GET DOWN GET LOW
[0:39:40] <SableS139a> Well that kinda hurts
[0:39:47] <Dhurkst> @Just_Quinn Everyone wants every character for every game, but devs aren't gods.
[0:39:52] <huskarl_zap> Will i break my keyboard in this like in tekken?
[0:39:54] <andre11dr> Sol has 3 levels, this is RIP
[0:39:56] <nailwind> it's ok, divine Reggie needs a handicap anyways
[0:39:57] <driveljam> anyone in chat know what the red web is?
[0:40:01] <andre11dr> Welp had
[0:40:13] <LegendGHT> I just want Bridget
[0:40:19] <SableS139a> The GGxBB 2013 Live version is probably the best version of this track.
[0:40:19] <%ECRead> I WANT JUSTICE
[0:40:25] <%GenericSoda> @driveljam Testament can lay down traps, his net can catch people to extend combos
[0:40:26] <chll0ne> LUL
[0:40:28] <TeethMuncher> @ECRead hell yeah
[0:40:28] <+Ganmorg> Justice would be pog
[0:40:30] <+Just_Quinn> @Dhurkst im saying this primarily cause blazblue got the whole roster treatment and i would love to see that for GG
[0:40:31] <cheap_turbo> #JUSTICE$GUILTYGEAR
[0:40:32] <+DizzyGunner> i want testament, just coz i like the band and he has metal songs for his moves

[0:40:41] <+ottermusprime2773> Let's get justice back in bois!
[0:40:42] <+Ganmorg> I'd love to see how she would look
[0:40:44] <Merkensteiner> #ABA4Lyfe
[0:40:44] <Solidnick18> LUL
[0:40:53] <nintega010> Zappa is another character.
[0:40:58] <RodBarrenechea> I found out like yesterday that Slayer has a tool reference in Xrd
[0:41:01] <RodBarrenechea> made my day
[0:41:05] <Solidnick18> hey now
[0:41:05] <%AlteisenReiseZ> AHHH THE FUCKING ASSASSIN'S THEME Bop
[0:41:07] <+Ganmorg> lol
[0:41:07] <andre11dr> I want Testament back, but just give Grace Digger and old 5 D and it would be fine
[0:41:12] <+Koover> Undertow is so cool
[0:41:13] <%GenericSoda> @RodBarrenechea Which one is that, Undertow?
[0:41:14] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Yoooo playing Kizzie!
[0:41:17] <RyuuAoi> Rebel Reggie
[0:41:18] <+Ganmorg> I just want Venom in Strive
[0:41:20] <RodBarrenechea> Undertow yeah
[0:41:20] <+Koover> spinning fire fist
[0:41:21] <neozz13> Also don’t be fooled, Dizzy is a secret beast in this game
[0:41:22] <%AlteisenReiseZ> BOP BOP BOP
[0:41:22] <Vinsfeld13> What's the salt about Testament?
[0:41:24] <+Yamchadassist> gg music is S++++ tier
[0:41:26] <SableS139a> Testamen'ts fucking cool. I wanna see him come back at some point. Give our dude some love.
[0:41:29] <+OroOreo> "bro buff pot" bro are you sure?
[0:41:31] <%ECRead> Just push Aria back into battle frame idc how you do it
[0:41:33] <+Ganmorg> I stan Venom
[0:41:41] <+Ganmorg> bol
[0:41:55] <%barkon345> there are so many metal references in this game
[0:41:56] <andre11dr> Testament has a Black Sabbath reference in his Instant Kill
[0:42:03] <+ottermusprime2773> Nah man, bring back justice!
[0:42:09] <%GenericSoda> @RodBarrenechea that might actually be a reference to Outrage. That album has songs titles Megalomania and Midnight Carnival on it, which are also referenced in GGXX
[0:42:11] <Aganok_> Venom's IK being Dimmu Borgir is wild
[0:42:19] <%barkon345> on of testements supers is called Master of Puppets
[0:42:19] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:42:41] <RodBarrenechea> @genericsoda Man please I want a reference to my favorite band too ;-; lol
[0:42:49] <driveljam> weird to me that characters reference all kinds of bands, feels really random which ones get referenced where for most chars
[0:42:58] <%GenericSoda> @RodBarrenechea Don't worry dude, there's enough that you can totally claim it for your own, haha
[0:43:00] <RyuuAoi> Woolie with the bum rush
[0:43:06] <Dhurkst> @Just_Quinn Blazblue had its roster built up over multiple games over several years with no resets from subseries. Strive is a subseries reset for GG; it'll take a long time for the roster to build back up.
[0:43:07] <Meltgar> I missed the GG sale BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
[0:43:09] <%GenericSoda> enough songs called Undertow*
[0:43:16] <+DizzyGunner> is order sol differnt from normal or just a costume swap?
[0:43:18] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Chipp only has his name for references, right?
[0:43:20] <%barkon345> also Sol's IK is called Napalm Death
[0:43:20] <huskarl_zap> Onga bunga
[0:43:27] <Meltgar> @DizzyGunner Different if i remember
[0:43:32] <Aganok_> Order Sol is completely different
[0:43:33] <TeethMuncher> @DizzyGunner very different
[0:43:39] <Vendigear> nice burst!
[0:43:42] <Zayasu> @Meltgar check fanatical
[0:43:43] <SableS139a> @Dhurkst Yeah. Plus for Strive, it seems like the plot-important characters are the main focus for the base roster. Which makes sense.
[0:43:45] <huskarl_zap> Woolie picking the unga bunga character right away
[0:43:45] <j3sharp> baiken built different
[0:43:48] <+DizzyGunner> thanks guys
[0:43:55] <jorniev> who is "that man?"
[0:43:58] <FrostedZaibatsu> Dont burst when somebody is under you

[0:46:51] <duskfeather6578> That order sol color looks like goldforged in brawlhalla
[0:46:53] <+Yamchadassist> the char portraits are really wierd to me in this game. theyre not anime at all lmao
[0:46:56] <RodBarrenechea> Wasn't Ky a Helloween reference
[0:46:57] <ghostofkombatjunkee> lol
[0:47:06] <+toastybites> May thinks Johnny looks cool too
[0:47:08] <huskarl_zap> im trollin
[0:47:14] <%GenericSoda> Ky has nods to Helloween, Rising Force, and Metallica
[0:47:20] <%CaptainPileDriver> the trials aren't even good combos to, like, her good shit was just as stupid hard
[0:47:21] <huskarl_zap> also pick the jonny bravo
[0:47:22] <SableS139a> And almost everything regarding Sol is a direct reference to Queen, though he's always been the easiest character to point out.
[0:47:24] <andre11dr> It's weird how obscure some of the references are but then Ky screams RIDE THE LIGHTNING!
[0:47:28] <+OroOreo> sajamSegue3 sajamSegue4
[0:47:29] <Meltgar> Woah LAG

[0:48:06] <nailwind> LOUD
[0:48:10] <%CaptainPileDriver> is there any game where sol is actually not a good character?
[0:48:18] <%SilverDevilfish> wooliePOYO 666 wooliePOYO
[0:48:18] <+zepelinnn1> god, Sol's sfx are so satisfying
[0:48:20] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Tyrant Rave is the Speaker Killer
[0:48:21] <+Yamchadassist> shit said PHSHGHSHSHSSS
[0:48:24] <andre11dr> I thought Jam was supposed to be Pearl Jam
[0:48:26] <%GenericSoda> he's rarely top tier but he's hardly ever bad
[0:48:27] <TeethMuncher> Turns out throwing money at stuff solves problems
[0:48:30] <RodBarrenechea> Sol sfx so chunky
[0:48:31] <nailwind> eardrums nuked
[0:48:34] <FeltSn0wman> speaker clipping is a lost art
[0:48:36] <SableS139a> @AlteisenReiseZ In other words, Tyrant Rave's perfect
[0:48:40] <SaltyAzteca> You will never toss coins with your initial on them BibleThump
[0:48:44] <huskarl_zap> johnny says "mama wheres my gel?"
[0:48:49] <deafmelone> Grand Viper is some shizz on the ears lol
[0:48:52] <krin_x> but when is the kizzie whoolie phantasmagoria stream
[0:48:53] <%GenericSoda> I really miss Tyrant Rave blowing out every window within a three mile radius
[0:49:02] <%CaptainPileDriver> i mean, sol is almost never top tier but he's always right there
[0:49:04] <macmens> Rollback is now
[0:49:05] <andre11dr> I think Dizzy is meant to be Ozzy
[0:49:10] <SableS139a> Same, Soda. Fucking same...
[0:49:36] <@Solidus_113> you hate to see it
[0:49:36] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1323566191978418177?s=19
[0:49:41] <driveljam> what metal reference is it when tyrant rave is making my ears bleed
[0:49:42] <%GenericSoda> @andre11dr Dizzy is Guns n Roses. Slayer's wifeSharon is the Black Sabbath reference
[0:49:50] <Aganok_> yeah, DBFZ is almost unplayable in same city
[0:49:54] <%CaptainPileDriver> yeah
[0:50:09] <andre11dr> @genericsoda Oh yeah, that makes more sense
[0:50:10] <SableS139a> @andre11dr Darren "Dizzy" Reed, the keyboardist for Guns n' Roses
[0:50:12] <neozz13> KOF14 is some atrocious shit
[0:50:13] <Dhurkst> @andre11dr Jam is Cloudberry Jam, a Swedish band. Dizzy = Ozzy doesn't make sense.
[0:50:13] <macmens> 120$
[0:50:13] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> woolieKICKDAD

[0:52:12] <FeltSn0wman> @ottermusprime2773 HELLO CHAD BROTHER.
[0:52:14] <SuckPuppet> I got Skullgirls for a dollar from them
[0:52:16] <%tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus price is the same up here, unless montreal is super cheap
[0:52:24] <FeltSn0wman> HOW ARE YOUR FIST ROCKETS TODAY.
[0:52:25] <andre11dr> Robo Ky is the ultimate degeneracy

[0:52:39] <RedHotBoss> Baiken theme in Korean reload!!! RICOCHET!
[0:52:41] <+ottermusprime2773> @FeltSn0wman I'm no chad, I play justice. My point still stands tho
[0:52:43] <neozz13> @destinyspider Xrd is a bad pc port in general
[0:52:45] <%GenericSoda> Best in video games? Hmmm I might pick Castlevania but GG is by no means an incorrect choice
[0:52:46] <cheap_turbo> Giovanas new theme might be missing
[0:52:48] <SonicD4> I do listen to it
[0:52:50] <@Menitta> Millia Gang
[0:52:50] <$RyTYoung> Is this on PS4?
[0:52:51] <FeltSn0wman> lmao got a justice secondary
[0:52:54] <Vendigear> lookit that strut
[0:52:55] <SableS139a> @SuckPuppet Doesn't Skullgirls go on sale super frequently on Fanatical? It's how I got the game for little over 3 bucks.
[0:52:57] <+Koover> I used to play the AC ost at my old job on the radio and everyone jammed out to it
[0:53:04] <@Menitta> ngl I like Guilty Gear just for Millia
[0:53:07] <FeltSn0wman> @WoolieVersus she can do xrd corner loops
[0:53:07] <destinyspider> @stinkerton22 Food prices in school are fucking criminal
[0:53:15] <SableS139a> @Koover Your coworkers have good taste, my dude.
[0:53:25] <Vendigear> but Kick Vanessa!
[0:53:25] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus the game is actually under 3 dollars on that link you shared
[0:53:28] <Meltgar> This baiken is WEAPON MASTER good
[0:53:29] <%GenericSoda> unfortunately I don't know anything about Baiken so I can't help
[0:53:29] <%CaptainPileDriver> so fuck it, i bought it
[0:53:30] <%elemaestro> gl hf boys. glad i got to watch b4 work
[0:53:34] <andre11dr> Im a big fan of thr special songs like Keep the Flag High, Conclusion,Still in The Dark ect
[0:53:40] <%barkon345> @WoolieVersus Ill give you that its the best soundtrack in fighting games. but saying all games is a huge stretch
[0:53:44] <%GenericSoda> Still in the Dark is a banger
[0:53:46] <STINKerton22> @destinyspider tell me about it man lol its crazy
[0:53:50] <SuckPuppet> @sables139a yep, all the time
[0:54:25] <destinyspider> @neozz13 That is unfortunate. I don't wanna pay for PS Plus so I thought it'd be smarter to just get the PC version even tho I already had it on ps4. Now I kinda feel like I threw away 6 bucks lol
[0:54:29] <+ottermusprime2773> 6K throw OS still exists
[0:54:53] <skewerstar> Baiken's command dash was a new thing added in Xrd, right?
[0:55:01] <FeltSn0wman> no
[0:55:02] <+Chronoreyer> nope
[0:55:03] <%GenericSoda> @skewerstar I think it was added in AC
[0:55:25] <FeltSn0wman> u just have to do the 412 input during the run like the guard cancel
[0:55:33] <TeethMuncher> @skewerstar she has it in +R, it's just got 1 followup
[0:55:39] <+ottermusprime2773> Yall need to hear the korean ost of this if you haven't
[0:55:44] <neozz13> @destinyspider I wouldn’t say you threw it away, the playerbase is still bigger on pc. But it is a bad one and hasn’t gotten patched for it’s crashes among other problems
[0:56:11] <+Chronoreyer> seal throw
[0:56:17] <+Chronoreyer> seal their throw button
[0:56:21] <FeltSn0wman> HS seal is really good
[0:56:30] <%GenericSoda> if you seal H that's no throws or teching
[0:56:30] <FeltSn0wman> no block for one hit @WoolieVersus
[0:56:33] <andre11dr> The thing with Baiken is that she's a top tier with good defense, Testament is not
[0:56:38] <FeltSn0wman> you can seal any button
[0:56:39] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:56:41] <+Ultimate_Edge> Well you should seal dust so they don't have burst, or hs so no throw techs
[0:56:49] <%ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> Man, Testament's a pretty sexy dude
[0:56:51] <destinyspider> @neozz13 Nah, it like legit runs at 12 fps tops. It's actually unplayable. At least since I got it on steam I suppose I can just try play it in case I ever get a better pc
[0:56:53] <Bustahhwulf> get brett in here LUL
[0:57:01] <huskarl_zap> trap game
[0:57:08] <SableS139a> Baiken being able to seal actions off was always a cool idea. Kinda upset it never came back in Xrd (to my immediate knowledge).
[0:57:22] <andre11dr> Most top tier in Xrd have kinda bad defense as well
[0:57:24] <destinyspider> Doesn't Zato=1 have like 2 or 3 different versions to summon Eddie in this game?
[0:57:30] <neozz13> @destinyspider yeah that sucks a lot man
[0:57:40] <destinyspider> Feels weird that that was removed in Xrd
[0:57:40] <+Chronoreyer> there are 2 different eddie movesets in this game
[0:57:45] <+Chronoreyer> the accent core and reload versions
[0:57:48] <SableS139a> ON GOD
[0:58:18] <neozz13> If you fight Sol, seal K or H
[0:58:22] <FrostedZaibatsu> Invisible traps
[0:58:29] <@Menitta> I remember a testament in Saltybet that won a tournament with an infinite
[0:58:29] <SableS139a> @Chronoreyer Does that carry over for GG Generations, or is GG Generations mechanic changes only? I haven't unlocked it yet.
[0:58:30] <andre11dr> If he gets the corner it's kinda free
[0:58:33] <%GenericSoda> Testament is all about traps, and Badlands loops are super easy to do
[0:58:37] <+Koover> dang trees
[0:58:42] <SaltyAzteca> The trees and the blood nets
[0:58:42] <huskarl_zap> Lmao traps the game
[0:58:44] <SuckPuppet> Did they update the art on the side or something?
[0:59:02] <andre11dr> Good screen control, good normals, good movement
[0:59:03] <destinyspider> I fought a Testament yesterday and I legit feel violated lmao. He beat my ass so hard, I barely had any way to defend myself
[0:59:03] <FrostedZaibatsu> This game is full of bullshit honestly
[0:59:03] <driveljam> you have multiple borders to pico from
[0:59:11] <TeethMuncher> @SuckPuppet there's a couple options in g ame
[0:59:12] <+Chronoreyer> I dont know what you mean by generations, it was just a change in +R that you can summon eddie with a different button and have the old moveset
[0:59:12] <+legendaryheroxx> @SuckPuppet you can choose which banner you want on the sides, theres chibis as well
[0:59:15] <%GenericSoda> the skull curses, and I think it has three different sequences of moves it can do
[0:59:19] <+SkyChase > Naoto + Arakune + puppet character
[0:59:25] <SuckPuppet> Ah ok thanks
[0:59:37] <andre11dr> Testaments weaknesses is if you hit him first and just keep mauling him
[0:59:41] <SableS139a> @GenericSoda Feathers, Crow Charge, and Zio giving you the axe.
[0:59:50] <%GenericSoda> you can get rid of the trees by jumping over them, and you can break the nets by attacking them outside of range
[0:59:50] <huskarl_zap> drops his see Dansgame
[0:59:51] <+RiceeFTW> skull is crazy
[1:00:00] <+kaibigan_exe> got late into the stream, have they gone over Jam?
[1:00:07] <driveljam> are you giving me permission to mash against testament
[1:00:08] <PhazeShift> this character seems like such bullshit
[1:00:08] <SableS139a> Not yet, my dude
[1:00:08] <%GenericSoda> the trees also go away if you hit him, unless he has dolls when he sets them up
[1:00:12] <TeethMuncher> Don't forget about Testament's teleport
[1:00:12] <SaltyAzteca> He's not annoying at all Kappa
[1:00:32] <andre11dr> He doesn't have any good reversals is i remember correctly, but has a counter
[1:00:33] <+Chronoreyer> testament also has an increcible defensive tool in forward exe beast frc
[1:00:46] <%GenericSoda> oh yeah, EXE Beast and Skull are amazing for space control as well
[1:00:46] <+Chronoreyer> incredible lol
[1:00:57] <destinyspider> Isn't a counter technically a good reversal?
[1:01:10] <%GenericSoda> @destinyspider not necessarily, I think it can still be thrown
[1:01:17] <huskarl_zap> THE MURDER
[1:01:19] <destinyspider> To my understanding good reversals are are just stuff that allow for a safer wakeup
[1:01:23] <+Chronoreyer> the counter sucks
[1:01:26] <destinyspider> @genericsoda Ah okay. Makes sense
[1:01:42] <+Chronoreyer> throwable and you can safely hit him with a bunch of moves and then not get hit by counter
[1:01:58] <FeltSn0wman> try slashback
[1:02:01] <RedHotBoss> dont forget to air throw at every opportunity to collect dolls
[1:02:04] <%GenericSoda> you can duck under the force break skull, but that means you're open to overheads
[1:02:09] <+MugenSandan> just wanna know, have they done these sort of character breakdowns for any other characters? and if so did I miss them try Order Sol
[1:02:14] <+Koover> 2F window iirc
[1:02:17] <SableS139a> Force Cancel skull is terrifying
[1:02:22] <andre11dr> @chronoreyer i was talking about meterless ,but with frc yes exe beast is insane
[1:02:31] <destinyspider> Testaments throw and Airthrow animations look pretty rad
[1:02:45] <+Ultimate_Edge> A parry so hard to use, everyone would rather faultless.
[1:02:57] <andre11dr> And even then his mobility is good enough to get out of bad situations
[1:03:17] <%GenericSoda> OH YEAH, Testament also has hella disjointed hitboxes so he can poke very safely. His biggest weakness is no real grounded anti-airs. He needs to meet the enemy in the air to anti-air
[1:03:58] <Solidnick18> so cool
[1:03:58] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:03:59] <Dhurkst> pseudo-Eddie
[1:04:20] <destinyspider> Talking about motivation
[1:04:28] <SableS139a> k e k
[1:04:45] <huskarl_zap> MOM
[1:04:46] <andre11dr> Also hes super is kinda bonkers, with the delay
[1:04:59] <+MugenSandan> HOLY ORDER REGGIE
[1:05:21] <%GenericSoda> yeah supers in general aren't SUPER useful in XX, but Testament's are both really good. Master of Puppets powers up his traps and Circular can be used as another trap
[1:05:35] <deafmelone> this is to be expected from the former sub-boss of the original GG
[1:05:37] <%GalacticaPhanto> man Testament in Reload was hype to play
[1:05:47] <killaholic89> Holy Order Sol -> HOS Holy Order Reggie -> HOR
[1:05:47] <huskarl_zap> drops
[1:05:54] <SableS139a> @deafmelone And the sub-boss of GGX
[1:06:03] <Blank9> I miss testament
[1:06:05] <+VersusOmnibus> Quick question from somebody who has never played Guilty Gear: Why is Baiken so hard to play?
[1:06:24] <Blank9> counter/setup character
[1:06:25] <RyuShinden> Mommy Baiken doodThirst
[1:06:26] <townzzzzz> one and dones LUL
[1:06:29] <lem______> you basically playing a diff game from everyone else
[1:06:40] <TeethMuncher> @VersusOmnibus weird gatlings, not a lot of health to work with, loops and damage require execution
[1:06:42] <andre11dr> I love Holy Order Sol ,but I'd rather have anyone back before him
[1:06:42] <+MugenSandan> because you are two distracted
[1:06:51] <destinyspider> I am really happy with what they've shown for DMC5 Vergil. My expectations were far exceeded, though that may be because I was being a little cynical...
[1:06:52] <%GenericSoda> @VersusOmnibus Baiken's gimmick is she can attack out of blockstun, which requires your timing to be kind of precise. She's also kind of low damage and also fragile.
[1:06:52] <huskarl_zap> ^
[1:06:53] <destinyspider> HOWEVER I still would have rather seen Force Edge's and Beowulf's movesets be combined into one weapon, with Vergil getting one entirely new one that is Urizen based and allows him to do tentacle attacks and shoot lasers/fireballs like the Urizen bossfight
[1:06:55] <RyuShinden> Once you play Baiken, you're not playing GG LUL
[1:07:01] <bogeyhaha> Hey! Baiken without an Eyepatch
[1:07:05] <destinyspider> That could have been so goddamn cool..
[1:07:31] <+MugenSandan> I just want Holy Order Sol's gameplay and charge bar back
[1:07:35] <+DizzyGunner> i feel like most characters in GG are unconventional in some way
[1:07:37] <andre11dr> If you want too put Order Sol in Strive do it when your out of caracters
[1:07:44] <+Brunocarvalhoc> wait you invisible trap the super?
[1:07:46] <%GenericSoda> lmao just do it
[1:07:48] <%Irridium> LUL
[1:07:50] <+MugenSandan> stick it on a new character if you need to
[1:07:50] <killaholic89> seeing HOS comeback as an original character would be cool
[1:08:03] <%GenericSoda> @Brunocarvalhoc the super has two versions, one comes out instantly and another comes out after a long delay
[1:08:09] <Dhurkst> @destinyspider FE & Beowulf fused together would be unreasonable, and an absolute mess to use.
[1:08:10] <%GalacticaPhanto> Man who would have thought adding an eyepatch on an already dope character design would make her even cooler
[1:08:18] <+Brunocarvalhoc> ah okay
[1:08:18] <andre11dr> This theme tho Kreygasm
[1:08:20] <+MugenSandan> HOS is just the angriest play style and I love it
[1:08:28] <SableS139a> SourPls
[1:08:46] <andre11dr> He has the Strive movmove in this
[1:08:49] <point4effort> Woolie playing on a pad?
[1:08:58] <andre11dr> The Ground Viper
[1:09:00] <%GenericSoda> rip eardrums
[1:09:01] <townzzzzz> LOUD
[1:09:03] <bogeyhaha> New character! "Sun Goodman" Kappa
[1:09:12] <+UnderseaMagic> time's on infinite too
[1:09:26] <duskfeather6578> Destruction of ears
[1:09:26] <destinyspider> A Justice/Jack-O hybrid in Aria would be sort of a cool character for strive. Or possibly something like "That Man" I imagine would make for a good final character of the base roster
[1:09:27] <+MugenSandan> That's unironically a great name tbh
[1:09:38] <%GenericSoda> Sol Goodman
[1:09:42] <nintega010> I love the Sol super sound destortion

[1:09:52] <%Irridium> Luna Goodman

[1:10:01] <%GalacticaPhanto> Luna Goodman
[1:10:04] <RyuShinden> @bogeyhaha Should be "Moon Goodgal" Kappa, and she a big tiddie waifu doodThirst
[1:10:06] <bogeyhaha> Let's Rock
[1:10:06] <+Koover> sidewinder loops are hype
[1:10:06] <%GalacticaPhanto> @irridium beat me to it
[1:10:08] <Dhurkst> @destinyspider And the tentacle one wouldn't make sense because he's not Urizen when he's whole. He didn't use Urizen stuff in the main game, so it wouldn't make sense with him playable
[1:10:10] <SunsetJack> Sidewinder is great
[1:10:17] <lem______> ill try to get in some matches after bracke
[1:10:18] <Kiaayo> ONEGAI
[1:10:21] <+MugenSandan> Actually why does Reggie play Sol as opposed to HOS
[1:10:33] <bogeyhaha> YAS@RyuShinden
[1:10:33] <lem______> cause HOS aint a normal shoto
[1:10:37] <%GalacticaPhanto> TATAMI GAESHI
[1:10:41] <duskfeather6578> Sol Greatddude
[1:10:43] <pitagor2> whats HOS
[1:10:44] <RyuShinden> @MugenSandan HOS kinda needs learnin
[1:10:52] <%GenericSoda> Sol isn't even a normal shoto, he's got a command grab and RIOT STOMP
[1:10:53] <RyuShinden> @pitagor2 Holy Order Sol
[1:10:58] <pitagor2> ty
[1:10:58] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts

[1:11:07] <nintega010> God I miss that sound I want it back
[1:11:11] <andre11dr> I'd rather just have Jack-O back over Aria ,but that is just because i miss the dumb gameplay LUL
[1:11:11] <SableS139a> But that's why Volcanic Viper is amazing
[1:11:20] <%GenericSoda> that's what makes Sol rad tho, he's like a weirdo offspring of Terry Bogard

[1:17:30] <neozz13> Woolie you set to private
[1:17:32] <BenTensCousin> you have to set a password, not set it to private
[1:17:34] <huskarl_zap> they probably dont have beta active
[1:17:34] <destinyspider> @genericsoda Don't do my boy like that. The teleports define a huge part of his playstyle
[1:17:36] <Div_the_Penguin> private is friends only

[1:20:18] <+VersusOmnibus> @dhurkst WHATDOYOUMEANHEISN‘THERE
[1:20:20] <%GenericSoda> Kizzie's only quiet because the game is blaring
[1:20:21] <puffntmd> woolie I have returned for my salty runback from high ggxrd rev 2

[1:20:34] <bdota3> Game is loud and kizzie is quiet
[1:20:36] <%CaptainPileDriver> I'm mashing to find the room
[1:20:38] <SableS139a> Kizzy's low on my end
[1:20:45] <Lavrohas> @WoolieVersus best sound check is sol moves. dem explosions :3
[1:20:45] <huskarl_zap> Set your volume to burst my eardrums gunshot decibles
[1:20:50] <+MTLxSpider> let kizzie in before joining lol
[1:21:01] <destinyspider> Sucks that I have like one moderately cool combo string with Chipp, but that only works on a soecific weight class apparently. And since the majority of people play Sol/Order-Sol, Baiken and A.B.A I can never pull it off and it's very sad B]
[1:21:27] <@Menitta> my strat with Millia is dash all over and hope for the best

[1:27:47] <+legendaryheroxx> Honestly each character in this game is their own single player game
[1:27:55] <%Eaglestrike117> Naoto or Sho

[1:41:46] <SableS139a> Justice only returns to boss status with Omega Shift, but from what I've heard, it's a pretty shitty install compared to Dragon Install or Necro Install.
[1:41:46] <Solidnick18> let's go justice

[1:42:50] <SableS139a> @neozz13 If Omega Shift was as good as Necro install, it'd be worth the meter.
[1:42:50] <zenith0111> THE CLASSIC
[1:42:52] <+AsinPersuasion> i mean jack-o fulfills the screen polution part
[1:42:56] <+Mecha_G> just a friendly reminder that Dizzy is Justice and Sol's daughter

[1:43:07] <Dhurkst> @eaglestrike117 aria is back, not Justice
[1:43:11] <%Eaglestrike117> Reminder that Ky IS Sols son in law
[1:43:11] <SableS139a> But then again, we'd probably never have Saperia Trance.
[1:43:18] <SaltyAzteca> Use the SUPA LASA

[1:46:22] <SableS139a> @Irridium @kewlmyc Zappa's made piece with the spirits living in him since he's a living medium, but fighting alongside them should not only still be possible, but he'd probably be even stronger than in XX.

[1:46:55] <+Ultimate_Edge> But you didn't account for the one overture Kappa
[1:47:07] <SableS139a> @jorniev He's plot important and we're at the end of the Valentine Arc, so yeah, Asuka's gonna pop up for Story Mode at least.
[1:47:07] <@Squdnate> Also a note. This rollback beta version is COMMUNITY MADE.
[1:47:08] <Lavrohas> yo bring back izuna and paradigm
[1:47:09] <%ECRead> Zappa would be super expensive to make if they did anything close to this version
[1:47:10] <andre11dr> I would be really interested to se wat will they do with a playable That Man
[1:47:14] <Lavrohas> playable pardigm would be dope
[1:47:26] <+Dova573> I got kicked
[1:47:28] <Solidnick18> i'm ready for nagoriyuki
[1:47:30] <+Superbro64> Considering that Strive is the end of Sol's story, having That Man be the final base char, or a dlc char, or maybe a secret unlockable char, would be very apt I feel SeemsGood
[1:47:31] <%AlteisenReiseZ> What's the password again?
[1:47:32] <halfmasks> gotta get the piece of paper and line of quarters to keep track
[1:47:32] <%GenericSoda> I want to see Izuna, the talk about how he would work with Daruma dolls sounds fun
[1:47:35] <+Dova573> for some reason :(
[1:47:36] <+Brunocarvalhoc> almost made it to the lobby :(
[1:47:37] <SableS139a> Give me Dizzy, Sin, Izuna, and Elphelt. I'll be happy at that point.
[1:47:40] <Lavrohas> izuna would be rad
[1:47:43] <%GenericSoda> @AlteisenReiseZ PPPPDK
[1:47:46] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's pppkd or ppppdk?
[1:47:51] <Lavrohas> overture may not have been for everyone but it had some sick shit
[1:47:53] <+Brunocarvalhoc> dk
[1:47:56] <munitalprats> yo the community
[1:47:59] <SableS139a> Izuna needs more love, tbh
[1:48:01] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @GenericSoda Thank you!
[1:48:05] <nintega010> @ECRead this is one of the reasons I don't think arcsys can do a One Piece game. Even though I want it
[1:48:05] <Dhurkst> @superbro64 where does it say it's the end of Sol's story?
[1:48:07] <zenith0111> @superbro64 They have yet to reveal the villian Character in the cast so it's entirely possible
[1:48:08] <%Irridium> @CaptainPileDriver ppppdk
[1:48:09] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> YEYE JAM

[1:48:38] <Danndy_Guy_in_Space> yo that ky color tho
[1:48:42] <%CaptainPileDriver> let me iiiin, I need to get in, we need to get candy in here
[1:48:42] <+Brunocarvalhoc> jesus LUL
[1:48:42] <+Superbro64> @dhurkst Daisuke has said this in interviews before. It's not the end of GG, but the end of "Sol's story" specifically
[1:48:43] <duskfeather6578> That man intentionally handed himself over to the military I think and guilty gear strive is going from that
[1:48:44] <+Dova573> @nintega010 They already it was a 3ds fighting game that was not good :(
[1:48:44] <RedHotBoss> throws were forbidden tech
[1:48:47] <FrostedZaibatsu> Aye man i grew up in the Chuck-E-Cheese streets
[1:48:47] <arkv01> the REAL FIGHT
[1:48:55] <+b_aleph> Don't ever pick Rugal
[1:48:59] <+tigerstyle96> Kizzie Kay on the mic???
[1:49:02] <halfmasks> the real meta is AFTER you finish your set
[1:49:04] <@Solidus_113> I came from a household where blocking was banned for being cheap
[1:49:05] <+Superbro64> @dhurkst think how BBCF was the end of Ragna's story
[1:49:08] <%GenericSoda> GOD those ARE Chie colors
[1:49:08] <@Menitta> Chie Jam vs TRON Ky
[1:49:12] <RedHotBoss> you had two matchups in the arcade. your opponent and your opponents character.
[1:49:13] <SableS139a> @halfmasks I wish I could go to her restaurant, tbh. I wanna try her cooking.
[1:49:22] <%GenericSoda> s h o c k s t a t e
[1:49:25] <+Superbro64> @solidus_113 None of my family knew what blocking low was
[1:49:26] <SableS139a> Also Kizzie's Ky is nothing short of divine
[1:49:29] <halfmasks> @SableS139a i aint talking about her cooking ;)
[1:49:30] <andre11dr> @b_aleph Unless your playing 95 then always pick Rugal
[1:49:32] <+mental_mashup> c
[1:49:39] <%Eaglestrike117> What Resturant? It blew the fuck up for the 5th time this week?
[1:49:44] <SaltyAzteca> Raido da raitoring!!
[1:49:51] <FeltSn0wman> seeing this makes me kinda glad my wifi made me dodge lmao
[1:49:55] <destinyspider> The Grinders in Xrd are fucking awesome. It is the first thing I ever saw about Guilty Gear and it intrigued me a bunch
[1:49:59] <+mental_mashup> Chat wildin if yall dont think green with brown hair is sailor jupiter
[1:50:03] <SableS139a> @halfmasks Hey, the 'other' meat buns are a bonus at that point. Or they go hand-in-hand. Whatever works. Either way it'd be worth it.
[1:50:04] <nintega010> @Dova573 the 3ds game was ok, but for what I want for a One Piece game I feel would be difficult. From characters, Movesets, & animations. LIke I want Logia types to be animated on the level of Venom from marvel.
[1:50:08] <Solidnick18> fear install
[1:50:25] <destinyspider> That he will just have that dumb shockstate in Strive by comparision seems conceptually very boring
[1:50:28] <+Brunocarvalhoc> my friend once said he almost got beat up for playing rugal in KOF once
[1:50:30] <FrostedZaibatsu> Naw i just kick my way out of the corner with Jam
[1:50:37] <%ChrisBardow> ggs Kizzie
[1:50:38] <+ataboy76> kizzie's ky scare me lol
[1:50:40] <+Superbro64> @destinyspider s h o c k s t a t e
[1:50:43] <%Eaglestrike117> He shoulda gotten beat
[1:50:46] <halfmasks> @SableS139a how cold were those stages on Xrd Rev 2 btw
[1:50:53] <DigitalJoshie> uh
[1:50:55] <MrHeph> damn, it is impossible to get in this lobby
[1:50:59] <@Solidus_113> BETA
[1:51:04] <+TheBesteban> broke so hard it froze me
[1:51:06] <%GenericSoda> Shock State seems fine. I like it
[1:51:08] <%Jetzord> dammit, I got got here
[1:51:09] <+Superbro64> shockstate is yellow now too, which is super wierd. It made more sense when shock state was blue in the strive beta
[1:51:09] <DigitalJoshie> ahh
[1:51:11] <%Wool> 6 person lobbies are wonky
[1:51:12] <%ChrisBardow> Oh I left post game to help the line so that might have killed it
[1:51:14] <+SkyChase > too many people increases the chance of lobbys breaking ,-,
[1:51:14] <Lavrohas> yall make sure dat Vsync is off too, that shit WILL crash that shit

[1:51:29] <%GenericSoda> @Superbro64 it could be a visibility issue, like for colorblindness
[1:51:34] <halfmasks> True story: I went on an Arcade Date with a girl i met on tinder, played a fighting game for kicks, got my ass BEAT
[1:51:36] <+Superbro64> Yovideogames were having SUPER BAD issues with their 4 person lobby
[1:51:53] <+Superbro64> @genericsoda Ky's lightning moves are all blue though
[1:51:57] <+Bail_seven> whos drinkin drinks with sugar in, in 2020
[1:51:58] <%GenericSoda> that's true
[1:51:59] <destinyspider> @superbro64 That miiiight just have been Leo exclusive? I dunno lol
[1:52:03] <SableS139a> @halfmasks A lot of the stages are pretty cool, but they don't feel AS metal as what we got in past games. More of the stages are lore-concurrent, so they feel more like places you could visit.

[1:55:45] <+zepelinnn1> @RedHotBoss woolie, play the game and leave the alt account
[1:55:45] <Nekros4442> Nah, Baiken has to bite the bullet for the rest of the cast

[1:56:04] <halfmasks> IF WOOLIE LOSES ANJI GETS BAIKEN
[1:56:07] <+Superbro64> Baiken loves a Boy in Blue you know Kappa

[1:56:34] <%SirGO0SE> SirGO0SE subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months, currently on a 9 month streak! Its surreal hearing kizzie with Woolie and Reg. I heard Kizz for the first time over 3 yrs ago with the Shaper of Stories, Brett Bayone on the Super Couch Fighters. It takes time, but worlds collide! Keep up the great work guys, love ya

[1:57:09] <RedHotBoss> baiken does not care about anji because hes not a blade, or a gun she can kill gears with
[1:57:09] <halfmasks> Imagine if Nagoriyuki takes Baiken
[1:57:11] <%Mordexai0> how much did I miss, did anyone use ABA?
[1:57:17] <+mental_mashup> Y'all dont think Baiken dont want the good D from Anji? Try before you buy status

[1:59:02] <halfmasks> @deafmelone either 3 or 4 podcasts ago
[1:59:09] <andre11dr> A.B.A is cool but she exists in a universe where everyone else is cooler
[1:59:16] <deafmelone> oh ok
[1:59:21] <SkreamnRedSkull> You're not wrong @andre11dr
[1:59:21] <Vashido22> anji is not cooler than aba

[1:59:26] <SkreamnRedSkull> And I have no issue with her
[1:59:29] <Vashido22> no way
[1:59:34] <zenith0111> Tbh I think they'll bring pin back. @superbro64
[1:59:41] <halfmasks> @deafmelone you best just check when they first teased Anji and finding the podcast that came out after
[1:59:43] <destinyspider> But the way things are now, if I got in I'd probably just ruin the fun
[1:59:49] <+zepelinnn1> ONE 1 TWO 2

[2:01:35] <zenith0111> @superbro64 With everything I've seen my bet is they're trying to see what they can get away with and changing it according to feedback. I think Strive is going to be vwry different on release then from the beta.
[2:01:41] <RedHotBoss> yes sadly Anji is an owner of the wind outrage peice

[2:08:38] <destinyspider> @floralkami It's still very fun to play anyway so it's mostly fine I guess. I am just afraid that, if the bad connection is on me, I may be wadting the time of and ruining the experience for other people

[2:10:06] <kasios> NO HELM
[2:10:06] <%GenericSoda> I like Potemkin with the helmet, but I think his design without the helmet is pretty basic
[2:10:07] <sappinmahbinyot> I think pot without helmet but with clothes would be the coolest
[2:10:07] <Kusano123> No helmet
[2:10:07] <+ataboy76> helmet for sure

[2:11:06] <SeaReally> thatd be so cool
[2:11:06] <floralkami> that would be legit
[2:11:06] <+arknodem> If he gets stunned, he loses the helmet would be dope.
[2:11:10] <+AsinPersuasion> is anyone going to miss long hair ky?
[2:11:10] <RedHotBoss> his helmit comes off in the Faust super tho
[2:11:11] <willg1222> agreed, no helmet and uniform would be cool
[2:11:14] <+arknodem> Or if he gets wallbounced too much or something
[2:11:15] <%GenericSoda> the helmet will for sure pop off when Faust breaks his shins with a wheelchair

[2:13:04] <destinyspider> Even tho the character actually seems to be p chill
[2:13:14] <%barkon345> the only character design I like better in xrd is milla
[2:13:16] <andre11dr> Reggie you have RCs
[2:13:18] <%GenericSoda> yeah Potemkin likes sketching in his spare time or something
[2:13:20] <halfmasks> good luck menitta
[2:13:23] <zenith0111> @destinyspider Well that's because he's literally a slave

[2:44:28] <%Eaglestrike117> fuck this im gonna go to bed
[2:44:29] <MaxXtreme23> @JustToWatch Set up is pretty broad, because to an extent you could call stuff like what Millia has setups but it's a bit different from the kinds of traps that characters like Testament or Byakuya from UNIB set up
[2:44:33] <%Eaglestrike117> stayed up til 3AM for nothin
[2:44:36] <+zepelinnn1> thats what you get for not getting sleep LUL
[2:44:46] <floralkami> yeah, I have yet to see anyone play or fight against a Slayer in any of the content I've watched so far.
[2:44:47] <puffntmd> @lavrohas nuts to you I need my salty runback

[2:45:12] <lem______> triple slash doesnt even feel like a super, ngl
[2:45:16] <+JustToWatch> fair enough
[2:45:27] <%CaptainPileDriver> no one is brave enough to let a slayer main be on their stream
[2:45:38] <Vendigear> @andre11dr we had a johnny early on
[2:45:51] <lem______> you know what, i should have expected someone with the name captainpiledriver to be a slayer player
[2:45:51] <emeraldskrull> always was woolieDATTEBAYO_HF woolieDATTEBAYO_HF
[2:45:51] <sappinmahbinyot> That was a ridiculous blockstring

[2:49:22] <Vendigear> he's got the shmovement
[2:49:31] <%GenericSoda> @FeltSn0wman Dustloop is a really good resource for stuff. In general spend a lot of time in practice figuring things out too. Who do you play? Are you new to GG?
[2:49:33] <OkamiDude15> i didnt know you had to do the inputs for dragon install after the first punch but then it just came naturally
[2:49:44] <Admiral_PopnFresh> damn
[2:49:46] <@Moobot> Please don't fill up the entire chat, @sappinmahbinyot
[2:49:54] <andre11dr> Sitting back, letting him charge is not what Woolie wants here
[2:49:54] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:50:02] <FeltSn0wman> ive played quite a bit of xrd and ive gotten pretty alright at it but its an issue ive seen across everything that i play
[2:50:26] <FeltSn0wman> like whenever i jab its always when theyre going for a frame trap or fishing for a whiff punish
[2:50:27] <FeltSn0wman> stuff like that
[2:50:28] <+LandOfTheWay> god i wanna see someone steal the other's soul with an IK

[2:50:48] <sappinmahbinyot> LOL
[2:50:49] <%Wool> WOW
[2:50:50] <Vendigear> YES
[2:50:51] <OkamiDude15> HERE COMES A DAREDEVIL woolieMIRIN
[2:50:51] <+Deko_> sit the hell down
[2:50:53] <Vendigear> THE MAN
[2:50:53] <lem______> OHH HERE HER COMES
[2:50:54] <nevan_44> LUL
[2:50:55] <nintega010> Hey at least during this session you haven't had to fight a good Zato
[2:50:55] <Vendigear> THE MYTH
[2:50:56] <+TheBesteban> I'm waiting
[2:50:57] <Vendigear> THE LEGEND
[2:51:01] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's cause everyone stopped going in
[2:51:02] <%GenericSoda> @FeltSn0wman try to reach out to anybody you can find and ask for advice. Keep track of your matches so you can see your strong points and weak points.
[2:51:02] <zenith0111> HERE COMES A DAREDEVIL
[2:51:02] <%Jetzord> *GLASS SHATTERS*
[2:51:06] <andre11dr> THE LORD
[2:51:10] <SuckPuppet> Crash incoming
[2:51:16] <%Irridium> BAH GAWD IT'S ESTABAN WITH THE CHAIR
[2:51:17] <destinyspider> Don't call it a glass break
[2:51:23] <%GenericSoda> @FeltSn0wman don't forget basic stuff like 6P anti-airs and FD braking as well
[2:51:24] <Vendigear> CHALLENGER APPROACHING
[2:51:30] <FeltSn0wman> well i guess thats kinda the issue i dont usually get to play so im not sure how im supposed to learn anything while stuck in blockstun
[2:51:48] <%AlteisenReiseZ> IT'S BESTEBAN WITH THE MONEY IN THE BANK CASE, HE'S CASHING IT IN
[2:51:56] <Vendigear> wow, Woolie shilling the documentary about himself
[2:52:03] <Vendigear> what a dork
[2:52:05] <FeltSn0wman> and yeah ik that stuff its more of an issue of actually playing neutral and not just blocking until i die like usual
[2:52:19] <andre11dr> These bursts.....
[2:52:20] <%GenericSoda> @FeltSn0wman Dustloop is a good resource: you can use it to look at frame data and identify problem moves that keep you in blockstun so you can figure out what to do. GG has lots of universal defensive mechanics like FD, Burst, and Dead Angle as well

[2:56:12] <%CaptainPileDriver> LETS GET DANDY FUCKERS
[2:56:18] <sappinmahbinyot> @FeltSn0wman Hmm, that's very matchup dependent in this game. I'd suggest asking and looking for your character's specific defense options, and also how to defend against characters you might be having the most trouble against.
[2:56:23] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Man Helter Skelter is so cool
[2:56:25] <%GenericSoda> @FeltSn0wman yeah that's definitely a hurdle a lot of intermediate players face. It's going to come down to learning about data so you can figure out what you can safely challenge to get out
[2:56:30] <sappinmahbinyot> ^
[2:56:31] <deafmelone> DANDYISM
[2:56:36] <%Irridium> fucking love Slayer's walk
[2:56:37] <%Jetzord> DANDY
[2:56:42] <andre11dr> I usually just dash 5P
[2:56:43] <%marrs_bars> gotta be the yogurt

[2:56:58] <Vendigear> nice burst
[2:57:05] <+Ben_Ben817> !uptime
[2:57:05] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 4 minutes

[2:57:08] <%CaptainPileDriver> INSTANT KILL HIM BESTABAN
[2:57:08] <FeltSn0wman> i learned how to play a few MUs with answer in rev2 and did pretty ok

[2:58:11] <MidnightPacif1c> waaaow
[2:58:19] <FeltSn0wman> strive defo feels like my kind of game

[2:58:24] <+Marchen144> LUL
[2:58:33] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Momentary Life is one of my favorite work out tracks
[2:58:43] <+hoenhime344> holy shit... woolie is live at this hour?
[2:58:45] <%GenericSoda> In any case, looking up specific ways to fight your way out is a good start. If you can find footage of your matches you can use that to identify your weaknesses as well
[2:58:50] <FeltSn0wman> i think where i need to start is finding the universal situations like dealing with IAD and stagger
[2:59:04] <Vendigear> nice burst?
[2:59:04] <lem______> xbox game bar time
[2:59:11] <FeltSn0wman> it doesnt help that robo ky doesnt even have a 5F crouching button either lmao
[2:59:15] <sappinmahbinyot> YOO
[2:59:16] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @hoenhime344 partially to have Kizzie Kay on, but also, why not stay up for Guilty Gear?
[2:59:17] <Vendigear> YES

[2:59:28] <+ManOfReason> ITS GETTING HOT iN HERE
[2:59:48] <%GenericSoda> @FeltSn0wman for IAD Answer's 6P is terrific. From there find some way to convert that into something advantageous to you. Doing 6P on reaction might seem scary, but because of upper body invuln it's more lenient than you might think
[3:00:08] <FeltSn0wman> yeah i was more thinking AC im actually p confident in my answer
[3:00:10] <townzzzzz> STYLED ON
[3:00:11] <zenith0111> Answers 6P is one of his best buttons

[3:00:16] <j3sharp> M I X
[3:00:16] <308caliber> too fast LUL
[3:00:17] <%GenericSoda> @FeltSn0wman Additionally, a flaw I see a lot of new players do is jump back before airdashing forward. See if you can suss out habits mid-match once you get a handle on 6P
[3:00:18] <+hoenhime344> that win pose!
[3:00:22] <huskarl_zap> the rumble fish?
[3:00:23] <%Axle13j> the swagger
[3:00:24] <lem______> what a dashing fellow, that slayer
[3:00:36] <%GenericSoda> the 6P advice still applies to +R. Who do you play? @FeltSn0wman
[3:00:37] <andre11dr> When in doubt, just bite them
[3:00:39] <Vendigear> we dancin'
[3:00:42] <FeltSn0wman> robo ky
[3:00:47] <%GenericSoda> Oh nice!
[3:00:48] <FeltSn0wman> i was the one on stream that kizzy steamrolled
[3:00:53] <%CaptainPileDriver> GIVE EM THE HAIKU
[3:01:00] <Admiral_PopnFresh> self in the corner...
[3:01:04] <sappinmahbinyot> What a dashing fellow. Do you think he might possibly relax on the ground when he loses a round?
[3:01:06] <%ekodrop> SLAYED AGAIN
[3:01:08] <Vendigear> KAX V BEST
[3:01:12] <Vendigear> GIVE IT TO US
[3:01:17] <MichaelOfCainhurst> NO HAIKU, NO WIN
[3:01:29] <%CaptainPileDriver> THE HAIKU IS THE MORAL VICTORY
[3:01:30] <%GenericSoda> @FeltSn0wman Kizzy is super good so don't feel bad about losing, haha. 6P is super good even as a poke, you might want to try using it to crank heat early on to improve your specials
[3:01:32] <lem______> GET INTO WOOLIES HEAD
[3:01:36] <Vendigear> yes
[3:01:37] <Vendigear> UES
[3:01:38] <Admiral_PopnFresh> HAHAHA LUL
[3:01:41] <Vendigear> GIVE IT TO US
[3:01:42] <%Wool> "touch this man"
[3:01:43] <%Jetzord> Man's just coming home to his rent-free apartment in Woolie's head
[3:01:51] <FeltSn0wman> heat only affects normals tho <_<
[3:01:55] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Bless him with Holyness
[3:01:56] <FeltSn0wman> but it gets KD which gives mat
[3:02:08] <lem______> i want estaban to say no and run away
[3:02:12] <zenith0111> KIZZIE BRING OUT THE KY
[3:02:20] <Admiral_PopnFresh> mind games
[3:02:25] <huskarl_zap> stunted
[3:02:28] <Vendigear> who is this man? where can I follow him?
[3:02:39] <Vendigear> does he have a twitter? a youtube?
[3:02:45] <%GenericSoda> exactly. Another thing you can try to do is practice Instant Blocking since it's the only way Robo-Ky can generate meter on defense. Try to find predictable blockstrings or multi-hitting attacks in problem matchups
[3:02:48] <%CaptainPileDriver> be my hero estaban, hit em with the haiku
[3:02:49] <FeltSn0wman> ive played against plenty of good ppl at locals i think literally my one issue rn is getting ppl to respect me mid match
[3:02:54] <+the22cstomp> BBU BABY
[3:02:59] <%AlteisenReiseZ> ESTEBAN, HAIKU PLZ
[3:03:01] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @Vendigear which guy?
[3:03:05] <FeltSn0wman> oh and that lol i forgot abt how important robo IB is
[3:03:06] <Vendigear> esteban
[3:03:07] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @lem______

[3:03:25] <lem______> KizzieKay
[3:03:30] <lem______> just look up on google
[3:03:32] <+JustToWatch> the answer is yes though
[3:03:34] <brambobelurkin> tense*
[3:03:36] <+Brunocarvalhoc> he can do 4 bbu in a row If he has the meter btw
[3:03:36] <%Struggleful> evoGG
[3:03:37] <Vendigear> oh
[3:03:38] <%GenericSoda> @FeltSn0wman Robo-Ky has lots of stuff that is very + once heat/meter gets build up, abuse that shit and make them respect you. Then you can start mixing in his command grab once they clam up
[3:03:59] <%GenericSoda> the horse is a good one for really long range + frames
[3:03:59] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:04:02] <andre11dr> He's not even doing the real combos
[3:04:02] <zenith0111> YES KIZZIES KY IS OD
[3:04:02] <nevan_44> LUL
[3:04:16] <FeltSn0wman> yeah but how do i get them to actually start respecting my pressure and not mash the second they leave blockstun

[3:05:26] <+ManOfReason> JESUS
[3:05:27] <%GenericSoda> @FeltSn0wman use frametraps. Robo-Ky's jab is +7, so you can even do something as simple as using another jab afterwards. Again, check out Robo-Ky's frame data to find something that has 8-10 frames of startup that leads to big damage on counterhit for people who try to mash
[3:05:28] <brambobelurkin> OH MY
[3:05:29] <+ManOfReason> corner ky

[3:05:38] <308caliber> Jesus K went in

[3:06:32] <%Wool> Wool subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months! Sad that my Bridget couldn't get in tonight, but Reggie I'm curious. Do you still remember what Led Retter Mediaand the 29th of Blebuary are? The 29th of Blebuary that only comes on a leap year?
[3:06:34] <FeltSn0wman> part of the reason i have trouble confirming sometimes is that i play a lot of KoF and u cant buffer confirms in that game bc of whiff canceling
[3:06:40] <%FuqBoiSlim> LET THESE MFS KNOOOOW
[3:06:42] <%Irridium> LUL
[3:06:43] <%Struggleful> LUL

[3:07:02] <%tank7013> That's so good LUL
[3:07:05] <Vendigear> BACK IN THAT CORNER
[3:07:13] <RodBarrenechea> !uptime
[3:07:13] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 14 minutes
[3:07:28] <%GenericSoda> Great! One thing about Robo-Ky's jab is that you want to find normals it doesn't necessarily cancel into to get the most out of frametraps. That or delay your next gatling to create gaps the opponent can fall into
[3:07:35] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Can I just say Ky's design is cool, but his sword is stupid?
[3:07:36] <nintega010> I've always loved Slayers grabs
[3:07:51] <Slapperpow7> Ky has a much better sword in Xrd
[3:08:18] <RodBarrenechea> Thunderseal looks wack af
[3:08:26] <RodBarrenechea> Magnolia Eclair is sick

[3:09:50] <+NotAMachine> raquelLit
[3:09:51] <Vendigear> this is some dang good GG
[3:09:53] <%GenericSoda> at some point you need to take risks. Robo Ky's normals are all really good so take advantage of that to frustrate people from outside of their range.
[3:09:55] <huskarl_zap> PogChamp
[3:10:05] <huskarl_zap> no bridget P
[3:10:09] <huskarl_zap> now
[3:10:09] <%FuqBoiSlim> wtf i love ky now?
[3:10:24] <zenith0111> TOOK HIS BURST ALREADY
[3:10:29] <FeltSn0wman> i just dont feel like i take risks that work out ig
[3:11:04] <RodBarrenechea> Yo Ky is the shit dude

[3:11:46] <brambobelurkin> love how the chat stops during matches so they can keep up with it. Thats some damn good FIghtin games.
[3:11:48] <+NotAMachine> ItsHappening
[3:11:49] <%GenericSoda> @FeltSn0wman In some cases you can bait people in by just doing 6PPP Mat. Building heat and meter at the same time while pushing out is enough to make people want to rush you down. You can try for pokes or a 6P from there
[3:11:51] <+ManOfReason> good games
[3:11:53] <ullyzeez> hella clean
[3:11:57] <lem______> I thought his name was hold back to block. why aint he doing that heree.... "pensive"

[3:13:09] <+Thatnerdyrunner> anychance rollback ever comes to switch version?
[3:13:10] <%tearfuldevil> eh
[3:13:14] <@Solidus_113> you can also get Rev 2 for $12 right now on that site

[3:13:25] <%tearfuldevil> personally i'm not that big on a bunch of GG's roster
[3:13:25] <drefizz> I suck as fighting games and even I bought it
[3:13:25] <lem______> @WoolieVersus when is this vid going up on YT?
[3:13:28] <%GenericSoda> @FeltSn0wman in any case, if you want to play sometime in the future shoot me a whisper here and I can give you some advice if you'd like to play
[3:13:44] <%tearfuldevil> Ky is just a lightning dude with sword
[3:13:46] <Lavrohas> @WoolieVersus any small quality of life you would want added? like autopass in lobbies or some form of saving colour select? (assume bugs are fixed)
[3:13:49] <@Solidus_113> @lem______ It'll likely go up the day before the beta ends LUL
[3:13:50] <zenith0111> @thatnerdyrunner This is only Beta so the rollback will go away and comeback later and hopefully they'll add it to all versions
[3:13:55] <FeltSn0wman> ill think abt it i rly just need to play a lot of ppl rn tbh
[3:14:14] <+Thatnerdyrunner> @zenith0111 hopefully, thanks for the reply
[3:14:16] <lem______> noice
[3:14:17] <arkv01> yeye all <3
[3:14:20] <FeltSn0wman> and play easier games so i can do more stuff without fucking up every other robo ky IAD i try to do
[3:14:28] <%GenericSoda> the rollback will help with that. Best of luck! If you're ever not sure what to do, check out the dustloop wiki for numbers and details on moves
[3:14:31] <+Yamchadassist> no funny i just started watching his channel like 2 weeks ago cause the rollback and hes great

[3:15:06] <%GenericSoda> kk good. It's a matter of practice, you know? I kept dropping DP inputs yesterday but I nailed them all in my match with Kizzy this evening
[3:15:10] <HelluvaNohbody> Got 1 round againt Wool, even if it's only because of the rollback borking
[3:15:19] <%CaptainPileDriver> I wanted to play y'all but I can try next week
[3:15:28] <FeltSn0wman> lmao i was the exact opposite i missed so many reversal dps against him
