[0:06:00] <+Trair> Samira is fem dante she even has style
[0:06:05] <Kalcom> her being 6 might be lore
[0:06:14] <$pluckrabbit> is Samira in runeterra?
[0:06:19] <+DrustyBoi> DrustyBoi subscribed with Prime. 
[0:06:20] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @BackwardCap
[0:06:24] <Nikbottom> @pluckrabbit no sadly
[0:06:24] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:06:27] <Johannen> If Woolie wanted to "Get into League" im sure he would just follow Pat and wait for the console version? or was it mobile?
[0:06:28] <$pluckrabbit> shame
[0:06:30] <munitalprats> @pluckrabbit not yet but she might come soon
[0:06:31] <pennykettle_> Got a 3080 and only been playing Disco, Binding of Isaac, etc
[0:06:54] <$pluckrabbit> woah buddy you might wanna upgrade for those game
[0:06:56] <waterstealer> samira not in yet
[0:06:57] <%nintega010> If you get into lore go to necrit youtube
[0:07:05] <waterstealer> guardians
[0:07:08] <trustiano> Nexus
[0:07:14] <waterstealer> the guardians take damage kinda
[0:07:15] <+MisterRockett> Can't wait to see how Woolie feels about this I'm anticipating a lot of "OH! Like in Teppen! I understand this!"
[0:07:16] <munitalprats> It's effectively just your HP
[0:07:18] <pacibuddy> yugioh duel links is kinda like that
[0:07:19] <+fugatlas> what you're describing sounds like magic
[0:07:19] <Nikbottom> yup
[0:07:20] <MyNameIsRasus> yeah, the nexus is just hp
[0:07:25] <%Juriasu> are there card games wihtout a "face"?
[0:07:31] <pennykettle_> Yea Hearthstone has your "Hero", but League lore says that like, you the player are a summoner who is playing as these legends. or some shit
[0:07:33] <MyNameIsRasus> that's what champions are for, tbf
[0:07:36] <JeoDood> a champion
[0:07:45] <Johannen> Well, LoL is a team game, so its kinda about building your "team deck" i would assume
[0:07:46] <%DrustyBoi> Gwent has that i guess
[0:07:49] <munitalprats> @pennykettle_ that lore doesn't exist anymore, you're just some empty void
[0:07:54] <Kalcom> this is not quite that
[0:07:58] <Kalcom> but yeah
[0:08:03] <pennykettle_> @munitalprats I think I heard that. But I've never touched league
[0:08:03] <MyNameIsRasus> yeah, i get you
[0:08:08] <AnnaLamb> league has always been pokémon with people tho, like playing as a trainer.
[0:08:28] <pennykettle_> the most you can do in runeterra is buy a skin that reskins your crystal
[0:08:28] <Johannen> MTG also does not have anyone you play as right? Its just health
[0:08:29] <munitalprats> I'm so excited
[0:08:30] <waterstealer> YEAH
[0:08:35] <waterstealer> SENTINEL OF LIGHT
[0:08:37] <waterstealer> LEZ GO
[0:08:37] <%Juriasu> volume is alright I think
[0:08:37] <Safarihat> @Johannen yes
[0:08:41] <+MisterRockett> Heroes tend to have decks built around them so it's still KINDA like that.
[0:08:42] <pennykettle_> didn't choose dark ResidentSleeper
[0:08:44] <munitalprats> Yeah its this event going on
[0:08:49] <laguerrilha> Yo new champ is in Runeterra already??
[0:08:50] <$pluckrabbit> unless you are play EDH @johannen
[0:08:52] <munitalprats> It's just free cards and emotes
[0:08:54] <waterstealer> dark side is the side of the SIMP SUPREME
[0:08:56] <MyNameIsRasus> you can get them all anyways
[0:08:56] <mrtanaka111> check out the lab too woolie
[0:09:00] <munitalprats> Volume is good
[0:09:03] <pennykettle_> volume good
[0:09:03] <MyNameIsRasus> volume is fine
[0:09:04] <laguerrilha> volume good
[0:09:04] <%MajorCrasher> what happened to Reggie?
[0:09:04] <AnnaLamb> it's the same rewards just different order really.
[0:09:11] <Nikbottom> I'm not here to backseat, just getting hype
[0:09:17] <+Son_Bruce> @laguerrilha he came out a bit earlier then LoL
[0:09:17] <macmens> you get the same rewards light vs dark determines what you get first
[0:09:21] <munitalprats> It's the same rewards just what you get first
[0:09:23] <munitalprats> Event
[0:09:24] <+Hasmeister96> Where's Reggie?
[0:09:24] <munitalprats> it's Event
[0:09:48] <%Exiliator> Childrens card games

[0:10:27] <laguerrilha> Do they have the Jet Stream Sam skin for Yasuo there?
[0:10:28] <%nintega010> lol fun
[0:10:28] <BackwardCap> gildedSmug
[0:10:31] <dds333a> @f0u1play indeed
[0:10:36] <munitalprats> yeah you're almost able to get the Yasuo starter deck
[0:10:37] <Daskolin> Baited by skin :D
[0:10:38] <MyNameIsRasus> You WILL get Yasuo
[0:10:39] <waterstealer> AYY
[0:10:43] <munitalprats> It has like 1-2 Yasuos in it i'm pretty sure
[0:10:45] <waterstealer> THATS THE DECK
[0:10:46] <pennykettle_> oh I don't remember a prologue when I started playing last year?
[0:10:54] <+Zyquux> Yasuo mains DansGame
[0:10:55] <pacibuddy> you will get that in like, 4 games i think
[0:10:56] <Kalcom> almost there for a deck
[0:10:59] <trustiano> Have you seen the league cinematics?
[0:11:02] <sparked963> Yasuo is fun. Thats how i learned the game on launch til Gangplank
[0:11:05] <munitalprats> yeah these tutorials are incredibly useful
[0:11:09] <waterstealer> DO IT
[0:11:11] <MyNameIsRasus> challenges are great
[0:11:11] <munitalprats> DO IT
[0:11:14] <Safarihat> 100% do the challenges first
[0:11:15] <pennykettle_> a LOT of mechanics have been added
[0:11:15] <waterstealer> DO THEM
[0:11:15] <MyNameIsRasus> do some of them
[0:11:15] <laguerrilha> Just like Strive
[0:11:16] <+disgruntledgruntle> The tutorial for LoR is super good and in depth
[0:11:19] <mrtanaka111> you dont really need to do them
[0:11:23] <+PikeBot> They add more with each expansion to explain the new mechanics
[0:11:26] <+Son_Bruce> they teach you the basics of all the types of cards
[0:11:27] <waterstealer> DO ALL THE CHALLENGES
[0:11:32] <+Zyquux> At least in LoR Yasuo is pretty fun. Just wait for Malphite or Leona to really pop off.
[0:11:37] <+cha0tic_klutch> !uptime
[0:11:37] <@Moobot> @cha0tic_klutch WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 21 minutes and 46 seconds
[0:11:37] <+InhumanMilitia> do you want deck codes woolie?
[0:11:40] <munitalprats> yeah it's just gain EPX really
[0:11:40] <Kalcom> don't do all, but do more
[0:11:41] <munitalprats> EXP
[0:11:43] <BackwardCap> Wat?
[0:11:45] <MyNameIsRasus> prologue road is the rewards
[0:11:47] <munitalprats> the prologue road is the rewards
[0:11:50] <waterstealer> REWARDS TAB
[0:11:51] <%CaptainPileDriver> yoo
[0:11:51] <munitalprats> It's where you saw yasuo
[0:12:01] <Nikbottom> time to comp stomp
[0:12:01] <waterstealer> yep
[0:12:02] <MyNameIsRasus> vs player unlock after yasuo
[0:12:02] <munitalprats> It's where there
[0:12:02] <%Juriasu> player unlock is there
[0:12:04] <%nintega010> Malphite is adorable
[0:12:07] <Johannen> Is Mordecaiser or Sion in this? Or Any of the "Big Bois" simmilar to Ornn? Galio maybe?
[0:12:08] <munitalprats> it's right there, VS PLAYER unlock
[0:12:08] <waterstealer> just keep doing the challenges
[0:12:10] <pacibuddy> ouch that takes a bit long
[0:12:21] <dds333a> So this is a card game? I have no idea what this is.
[0:12:28] <munitalprats> aww yeah Lux
[0:12:30] <pacibuddy> @dds333a yep
[0:12:36] <waterstealer> BRAUM BABY
[0:12:37] <TreeLeafBoi> Card game
[0:12:40] <waterstealer> BRAUM IS HERE
[0:12:41] <MyNameIsRasus> BRAUM is cool
[0:12:43] <+Zyquux> @dds333a Yes, it's the League card game
[0:12:47] <trustiano> BRAUM Kreygasm
[0:12:48] <%PirateDad_> STAND BEHIND BRAUM
[0:12:49] <pacibuddy> braum is the best
[0:12:52] <+nial_evol> that has a good ramp anyways
[0:12:52] <MyNameIsRasus> you usually want a curve
[0:12:53] <+patel347> just get rif of high mana stuff
[0:12:54] <pennykettle_> Poros, because every game needs a Minions-like mascot
[0:12:55] <%Juriasu> replace high cst cards?
[0:12:57] <waterstealer> mulligan expensive cards typically
[0:12:59] <munitalprats> Usually the safest mulligan is to mulligan for cheap stuff and get rid of high mana stuff
[0:12:59] <mrtanaka111> you can right click cards
[0:13:06] <%CaptainPileDriver> your hand seems fine
[0:13:07] <Fetty_Krill> Replace that 6 cost
[0:13:07] <Kalcom> replace the high cost cards
[0:13:11] <+Zyquux> as a general rule of thumb, you're safe to mulligan anything that costs more than 4 mana
[0:13:20] <BackwardCap> You generally want low cost cards in opening hand unless its a hard to find win condition.
[0:13:28] <+patel347> yeah unless you have a 3rd party app
[0:13:29] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:13:32] <AnnaLamb> could always get a deck tracker.
[0:13:33] <Aaronc123425> theyor8Ayaya main
[0:13:33] <waterstealer> theres a program for that
[0:13:36] <+Son_Bruce> @woolieversus there are deck trackers
[0:13:37] <dds333a> I've never Mulliganed in MTG, which is the ONLY. card game I have any familiarity with
[0:13:39] <Daxalog> I just got here. Did he play the tutorial?
[0:13:39] <waterstealer> theres a deck tracker
[0:13:44] <MyNameIsRasus> there are some cards that allow you to predict what you'll draw
[0:13:47] <+denizen_conspirator> There's several decklist mods for this game that will show you your deck at least @WoolieVersus
[0:13:52] <+Son_Bruce> they are built in if you download the tracker
[0:13:59] <+nial_evol> the turn system is unique in this yeah
[0:14:02] <%Juriasu> is it kind of like magic with phases?
[0:14:06] <+ItsRatman> Gotta feel that ebb and flow
[0:14:07] <pacibuddy> yeah its weird but pretty fun
[0:14:09] <munitalprats> It depends on what you do
[0:14:10] <sparked963> The slow and fast spells confused me alot at first
[0:14:11] <pennykettle_> some spells have different speeds
[0:14:13] <waterstealer> you get used to it
[0:14:19] <MyNameIsRasus> a turn only ends when both players pass after not doing anything
[0:14:19] <Deasmeister> Spells mess with flow
[0:14:20] <Torgue_1> @Juriasu Similar
[0:14:21] <iosephe> oh, priority
[0:14:23] <+coldsama> The order of things and cards is a trick to understand too
[0:14:25] <+Zyquux> I use the Mobalytics deck tracker. it helps when first starting out
[0:14:28] <+MisterRockett> Like Teppen you guys get chances to react to each other's Spells.
[0:14:30] <+denizen_conspirator> @sparked963 It's similar to MTG, there's fast, slow, and burst spells
[0:14:33] <%Juriasu> fopr bluffing I guess?
[0:14:34] <waterstealer> autopass is in the options
[0:14:35] <Kalcom> it's Yu-Gi-Oh
[0:14:36] <munitalprats> There's a setting for autopass
[0:14:41] <Daxalog> Sometimes you dont want to pass
[0:14:43] <Daskolin> How long till woolie get in most toxic MOBA in the history?;D
[0:14:44] <waterstealer> dont attack yet
[0:14:44] <+Zyquux> you can enable auto-pass but I don't recommend it.
[0:14:49] <Fetty_Krill> No
[0:14:56] <waterstealer> bad trade oof
[0:14:56] <pennykettle_> autopass is on by default I think, but the game does genuinely not pass when you have nothing you can do
[0:14:57] <trustiano> You can mindgame passing with cards you can play
[0:14:59] <MyNameIsRasus> let's try not to backseat too hard
[0:15:01] <+ProxyAskew> you can turn autopass on if you prefer it, it's off by default to bluff that you have something to do.
[0:15:02] <+ItsRatman> Turn 1 and the backseating begins already
[0:15:09] <pacibuddy> cardgame backseating is the worst, chill guys this is just the AI
[0:15:15] <sparked963> @denizen_conspirator Yeah i got it pretty good now but every once in a while i get confused and think just spell. bad pokemon habits
[0:15:24] <dds333a> Wait, when was the attack phase? it just happens?
[0:15:34] <munitalprats> @dds333a The sword token determines who can attack
[0:15:36] <+Zyquux> @d
[0:15:37] <AnnaLamb> if you right click you can see the full art, it's really nice.
[0:15:43] <dds333a> I see, thanks
[0:15:45] <pennykettle_> @dds333a any time during your turn when you have the sword, you can choose to put your units on the middle of the board toa ttack
[0:15:48] <%CaptainPileDriver> card game backseating is built into anyone who places TCG's it's hard not to, i just wanna see woolie learn a new card game
[0:15:50] <+goose_attack_almanac> In case you haven't seen it yet. You can view a full cards art by clicking on the Eye icon on the bottom right when viewing a card
[0:15:54] <+denizen_conspirator> @sparked963 gotya, yeah, same, the big thing is, there's a "stack" and fast spells can be casted one after another, but burst spells do not allow a reaction
[0:16:04] <dr_doriah> time to spend $65 for 7 card arts SeemsGood
[0:16:07] <waterstealer> USE SPELL
[0:16:09] <%nintega010> i love that the cards talk and tell a story
[0:16:19] <dds333a> @pennykettle_ okay, thanks for the further info too
[0:16:27] <Fetty_Krill> Yeah you'll learn over time have fun Woolie.
[0:16:31] <+Zyquux> @nintega010 Cithria in LoL when
[0:16:41] <dr_doriah> yea just look for value woolz
[0:16:44] <dr_doriah> you got this
[0:16:46] <munitalprats> they didnt defend because the spell wears off
[0:16:47] <%krispen_wa> is there a card game equivalent to doing a raw level 3 super?
[0:16:48] <pennykettle_> its fine if anyone has trouble understanding how the game works, its a steep learning curve
[0:16:51] <waterstealer> they saw it would have been a bad trade
[0:16:54] <+PikeBot> They didn't defend because it would give up their board advantrage.
[0:16:56] <trustiano> BRAUM Kreygasm
[0:16:56] <%Juriasu> yeah
[0:16:57] <waterstealer> you can cast the spell during combat
[0:16:58] <+disgruntledgruntle> You want to buff at last minute to bait them into bad trades
[0:16:59] <%CaptainPileDriver> yes
[0:17:01] <Nikbottom> the presentation in this game is incredibly good
[0:17:03] <%Afterman_> gotta know when its worth to def
[0:17:04] <%Juriasu> health is also a resource
[0:17:15] <Kalcom> Ai is playing good
[0:17:17] <Frostydough1> Yupp that’s it
[0:17:20] <munitalprats> Braum is on the job!
[0:17:21] <Johannen> Trading HP for maintaining resources
[0:17:23] <%Afterman_> the hook symbol
[0:17:23] <waterstealer> challenger
[0:17:26] <sparked963> @denizen_conspirator the new before battle spells added a new layer too. Got real confused trying Riven yesterday lol
[0:17:26] <Sadpylon> Only health that matters is the last 1 pip
[0:17:30] <+InhumanMilitia> so blink spells (the sparkle cards) can be used to ambush and sucker in someone to block
[0:17:30] <dds333a> 0/5 is a good wall
[0:17:43] <munitalprats> so basically he blocks hits, taunts them to hit him more, and regens
[0:17:43] <Frostydough1> That’s challenger yes
[0:17:44] <waterstealer> yup
[0:17:46] <pennykettle_> love watching people just learn
[0:17:46] <munitalprats> It's so he can level
[0:17:52] <dr_doriah> press the eye next to your nexus if you want to double check what would happen.
[0:17:53] <+denizen_conspirator> yeah, forgot to mention, focus spells, which are burst, but not able to use in battle, that's fun! @sparked963
[0:18:01] <+Zyquux> @krispen_wa Unyielding Spirit + Powder Kegs is fun. it requires set up so I wouldn't say it's raw, but if you get it going, you can blast them with spells.
[0:18:08] <waterstealer> GAREN
[0:18:12] <waterstealer> LEZ GO
[0:18:14] <dds333a> @munitalprats Champs can level?

[0:19:42] <+denizen_conspirator> SPIIIIN TOO WIN!
[0:19:45] <munitalprats> his other art has different dialogue too :)
[0:19:47] <pennykettle_> every card has a full ass wallpaper art
[0:19:53] <+froduck42> Voiced by Papa Nier
[0:20:03] <+goose_attack_almanac> Garen's thing is he drops a guren lagan sized sword on top of people to execute them
[0:20:05] <waterstealer> the discard part doesnt matter
[0:20:15] <munitalprats> nah, it's just for him
[0:20:16] <%Juriasu> it says allies before
[0:20:16] <Crombells> it's notable that "grant" means it's permament, while "give" means it's for this turn
[0:20:20] <MyNameIsRasus> Everywhere for him
[0:20:21] <munitalprats> poro 'allies'
[0:20:22] <+PikeBot> all poro *allies* everywhere
[0:20:23] <+denizen_conspirator> @goose_attack_almanac his thing in this game is, he gives your side rally every turn
[0:20:28] <OblivionSword1> fun fact Garen is voiced by papa Nier @WoolieVersus
[0:20:28] <+Zyquux> all photos in all games everywhere Kappa
[0:20:29] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:20:33] <dds333a> Gideon is Jamieson Price? cmonBruh
[0:20:37] <munitalprats> he can't hurt he can only block
[0:20:47] <laguerrilha> Garen is lame to play as, but his Ult of droping a skycraper sword on you is dope
[0:20:48] <waterstealer> drag poro, attack with garen
[0:20:48] <MyNameIsRasus> garen and braum are just free atacks because of regeneration
[0:20:49] <+goose_attack_almanac> @denizen_conspirator also true
[0:20:51] <lazysaiyajin> yooooo
[0:20:52] <munitalprats> you could taunt the braum
[0:20:55] <munitalprats> with your braum
[0:20:57] <+l3sovikk> Have braum grab the other braum and force him to block someone else with garen
[0:20:58] <+ItsRatman> You can totally do a thing here, but I'll let him figure it out
[0:21:01] <%notsoy> regen means free potshots
[0:21:05] <%Juriasu> this is kind of like mtg in the sense that you end of building boards until you can start overwhelming I guess
[0:21:05] <Fetty_Krill> yes
[0:21:05] <+InhumanMilitia> garen can kill use braum tp pull other braum
[0:21:06] <+disgruntledgruntle> Hvae braum cahllenge a 4/4
[0:21:06] <dds333a> yeah, there it is
[0:21:07] <+chase959> braum and pull the weak shepard
[0:21:08] <MyNameIsRasus> garen wants to strike twice to level up, and braum wants to get damaged to level up
[0:21:11] <+coldsama> the wording is usually very good,tho watch out for singular and plurals, sometimes it's just a word that can mislead if read too fast
[0:21:14] <+goose_attack_almanac> challenge braum with braum
[0:21:15] <+ProxyAskew> make you you read level up conditions on the champion cards.
[0:21:20] <+nial_evol> he don't understand the hook

[0:21:43] <Hirumm> he's getting used to it chat
[0:21:44] <+Zyquux> the hook on Braum is so that you can choose how much damage he takes
[0:21:47] <+InhumanMilitia> DO it
[0:21:49] <%CaptainPileDriver> that would kill most of their board
[0:21:49] <emptyantics> Teppen type beat
[0:21:50] <waterstealer> AVALANCE DO IT
[0:21:52] <+chase959> good luck with your match

[0:23:51] <%kewlmyc> This dude sounds like Zangeief
[0:23:52] <+Son_Bruce> @woolieversus Heya just a tip to see what will happen if you use a card before you use it. the blue circle between the 2 nexus will show you a preview of what will happen.
[0:23:54] <+Zyquux> @laguerrilha yes. now he generates a 3/3 whenever he survives damage
[0:23:55] <munitalprats> read garens effect

[0:25:33] <GingaNZ> smart stufd
[0:25:36] <+ProxyAskew> yep, once on defense and on offense.
[0:25:37] <+coldsama> Round Start is what it is, you attack if you wish

[0:26:51] <%Juriasu> he's Garen! from Runes!
[0:26:52] <munitalprats> Redoubled valor!
[0:26:54] <%nintega010> @waterstealer how?
[0:27:00] <munitalprats> Make garen big beefy!
[0:27:01] <waterstealer> fundamentals
[0:27:04] <waterstealer> like woolie said
[0:27:07] <%CaptainPileDriver> he is the room temperature water he was always meant to be
[0:27:11] <pennykettle_> Overwhelm
[0:27:11] <munitalprats> Overwhelm
[0:27:12] <+PikeBot> If you attack right now, they won't be able to play additional defenders
[0:27:13] <+coldsama> Overwhelm
[0:27:14] <HarmlessCrow> Garen's signature move is literally a tatsumaki
[0:27:17] <MyNameIsRasus> overwhelm
[0:27:19] <trustiano> Overwhelm
[0:27:24] <+probably_facetious> 12/12 regen is great!
[0:27:27] <waterstealer> hes not big enough
[0:27:27] <emptyantics> Overwhelm
[0:27:31] <+Zyquux> Redoubled Valor on Garen basically makes him immortal against this deck
[0:27:31] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1420054806341816326?s=19
[0:27:40] <whirly25> trample
[0:27:41] <laguerrilha> oof
[0:27:48] <mrtanaka111> he can still block
[0:27:50] <dds333a> So is that pump perm, or only for this turn?
[0:27:53] <munitalprats> Braum level u
[0:27:53] <Kalcom> great plays by the AI
[0:27:55] <munitalprats> attack with braum
[0:27:56] <+jepupu> jepupu subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months! woolieFUN
[0:27:58] <MyNameIsRasus> you want braum to take damage this round
[0:27:59] <laguerrilha> gareb
[0:27:59] <+denizen_conspirator> @dds333a perm
[0:28:00] <munitalprats> Garen has 0 attack
[0:28:00] <waterstealer> garen
[0:28:04] <sparked963> Gonna be a lot of learning keywords
[0:28:04] <MyNameIsRasus> garen has 0 attack
[0:28:06] <dds333a> neat
[0:28:09] <waterstealer> garen has 0 attack and an ice effect
[0:28:11] <+probably_facetious> @dds333a It's permanent
[0:28:11] <%Javaa01> It's the one that is frozen
[0:28:12] <pennykettle_> Garen's attack has ice on it
[0:28:17] <munitalprats> Pull something in with braum
[0:28:20] <+denizen_conspirator> the debuff is this round only
[0:28:26] <GingaNZ> hook em in
[0:28:31] <Hirumm> you can purposefully have Braum challenge someone to proc his level up
[0:28:50] <waterstealer> yep
[0:28:53] <+Zyquux> DING DING
[0:28:53] <MyNameIsRasus> but he wants to take damage, read his level up condition
[0:28:55] <mrtanaka111> you can lvl him too
[0:28:55] <waterstealer> now you're getting it!
[0:29:14] <GKannel> wet ass keyword
[0:29:14] <waterstealer> it didnt do it so its just a regular poro
[0:29:20] <sparked963> Plunder confused me so much at first
[0:29:22] <waterstealer> they did
[0:29:25] <munitalprats> they did
[0:29:26] <waterstealer> they're just bodies
[0:29:30] <munitalprats> just pull something in so braum levels
[0:29:45] <+Zyquux> just don't forget about combat tricks like poro snax than might make the blocker strong enough to one shot Braum
[0:29:47] <Crombells> you're getting it Woolie!
[0:29:56] <%Juriasu> can you multi-block in this game?
[0:29:57] <waterstealer> FUCKING ELNUKS
[0:29:58] <MyNameIsRasus> leveling up champions is almost always the win condition
[0:30:00] <+Ricky_Rexx> If Garen is Ryu is Braum Zangief?
[0:30:01] <munitalprats> oh god elnuks monkaS
[0:30:01] <mrtanaka111> remember:health is a resource to be spent
[0:30:03] <Daxalog> it actually is
[0:30:04] <waterstealer> TRYNDAMERE

[0:30:15] <pennykettle_> Tyrandamere is dope
[0:30:16] <Jaysky> Game ender
[0:30:19] <%Juriasu> oh
[0:30:20] <pennykettle_> SMOrc
[0:30:21] <Johannen> Death? I spit in the face of death
[0:30:22] <%mr_sups> Tryndamere is STONK
[0:30:24] <waterstealer> YEAAAAAAAH
[0:30:27] <waterstealer> TIMMY AS SHIT
[0:30:28] <munitalprats> BIG MAN
[0:30:29] <munitalprats> TIMMY
[0:30:30] <+Zyquux> @juriasu no, it's 1v1. But you can do combat tricks to bring down a big guy
[0:30:30] <%Juriasu> 8 mana is expensive though right?
[0:30:32] <MyNameIsRasus> WE TIMMY
[0:30:33] <pennykettle_> all champions get +1/+1 when they level up FYI
[0:30:34] <morow1ec> BIG WIPEOUTS
[0:30:36] <FassieFons> trynd GORILLA
[0:30:37] <dds333a> In the actual game, if I understand correctly, he's pretty good too LUL
[0:30:40] <MyNameIsRasus> You can attack btw
[0:30:40] <waterstealer> YOU CAN ATTACK
[0:30:40] <munitalprats> you can attack!
[0:30:44] <trustiano> TRONDOMERE SMOrc
[0:30:46] <MyNameIsRasus> because of garen
[0:30:48] <GingaNZ> attack
[0:30:49] <+chase959> you can attack on his turn bc of garen as well
[0:30:49] <%Juriasu> @Zyquux ah thanks, my brain is based on MTG lol
[0:30:49] <Kalcom> attack
[0:30:51] <munitalprats> because of garen!
[0:30:52] <+Ricky_Rexx> Garyu can attack again
[0:30:52] <pennykettle_> oh yea you can attack because of Garen!
[0:30:53] <AnnaLamb> think woolie might like freljord lol
[0:31:10] <+Ricky_Rexx> @AnnaLamb Cause it's the coolest, pun not intended
[0:31:31] <lazysaiyajin> only when its attacking?
[0:31:31] <munitalprats> you can attack because of ryu!
[0:31:33] <waterstealer> he's getting it!
[0:31:37] <munitalprats> garen!
[0:31:39] <MyNameIsRasus> because of garen
[0:31:39] <waterstealer> thats garen's ability
[0:31:42] <Deasmeister> yep
[0:31:44] <MyNameIsRasus> yes
[0:31:46] <trustiano> Yes
[0:31:51] <+Zyquux> @juriasu LoR is a lot more like Hearthstone than MtG in the basics
[0:31:51] <AnnaLamb> you can attack on defense too.
[0:31:51] <pennykettle_> Now you can attack on your turn AND the opponents FeelsGoodMan
[0:31:55] <+patel347> depends on who starts the attack first
[0:31:56] <macmens> you can attack
[0:31:57] <MyNameIsRasus> if you want, you can attack
[0:32:00] <+goose_attack_almanac> You can both initiate an attack
[0:32:00] <+patel347> the other becomes blockers
[0:32:00] <munitalprats> depends on who attacks first
[0:32:01] <dds333a> Swing for the fences, i guess
[0:32:08] <+MisterRockett> you can?!
[0:32:12] <%Juriasu> @Zyquux kind of seems like a mix of both from what little I have seen
[0:32:15] <waterstealer> yep with darius it matters
[0:32:17] <+MarcN0tMark> its time to swing marcn0Slapslap marcn0Fightback marcn0Slapslap
[0:32:23] <waterstealer> pull in tavernkeeper
[0:32:30] <+patel347> quick attack only works when they intiate the attack
[0:32:30] <laguerrilha> the quick atk would save your other cards
[0:32:40] <Hirumm> you can click and hold over multiple monsters you want to attack
[0:32:42] <MyNameIsRasus> btw woolz, quick attack only works when the unit is attack
[0:32:46] <+goose_attack_almanac> Quick attack does not work when defending
[0:32:48] <sparked963> You wont heal with Regen until next turn. Not next attack
[0:32:49] <+Zyquux> @juriasu yeah it is. on the scale of complexity with Hearthstone and MtG on opposite ends, LoR is right in the moddle
[0:32:51] <+PikeBot> quick attack only works when the card is ont he attack
[0:32:51] <Mundkipz> nooo quick attack activates when the unit attacks not defends!!
[0:32:55] <+Zyquux> middle*
[0:32:57] <MyNameIsRasus> if they're blocking, quick attack does not work
[0:33:20] <dds333a> All those Poros. lined up like tokens
[0:33:22] <+disgruntledgruntle> Block with tryndamere
[0:33:25] <munitalprats> that was because Braum leveled up, he has a new effect
[0:33:25] <waterstealer> surviving damage
[0:33:27] <AnnaLamb> you attacking
[0:33:27] <+patel347> that wos you attacking
[0:33:27] <+Ricky_Rexx> Now they're attacking
[0:33:28] <%notsoy> you both get attack turns, yeah
[0:33:29] <munitalprats> it was YOU attacking
[0:33:29] <+nial_evol> that was you attacking and now it's their attack
[0:33:30] <+PikeBot> That was you attacking
[0:33:30] <%PirateDad_> just you
[0:33:30] <MyNameIsRasus> that was you attacking
[0:33:30] <Deasmeister> you attacking
[0:33:31] <emeraldskrull> woolie has fallen. we must save him from this dark hole
[0:33:31] <+TomoeMoeGozen> You attacked they blocked
[0:33:32] <+goose_attack_almanac> he was defending
[0:33:33] <+patel347> now they are attacking
[0:33:34] <pennykettle_> You spent your attack token, they defended. Now they are attacking and you are defending
[0:33:34] <munitalprats> he's attacking now
[0:33:35] <%PirateDad_> now they are attacking
[0:33:35] <+coldsama> You then he attack immediately after
[0:33:35] <Nikbottom> now he is attacking
[0:33:36] <waterstealer> you were attacking
[0:33:36] <MyNameIsRasus> and he blocked
[0:33:37] <+TomoeMoeGozen> yes
[0:33:38] <waterstealer> now they are
[0:33:38] <+denizen_conspirator> Just you attacking, now they're attacking you
[0:33:43] <Crombells> you were attacking, he was defending, then it switched turns and he's attacking now
[0:33:46] <MyNameIsRasus> after you attacked, he chose to attack
[0:33:50] <Fetty_Krill> You attacked they blocked
[0:33:51] <GingaNZ> yeah it's odd
[0:33:51] <+Ricky_Rexx> Let em die
[0:33:55] <+MarcN0tMark> use trynd
[0:33:57] <waterstealer> block quick attack with trynd
[0:34:01] <Nikbottom> get em Conan
[0:34:05] <+goose_attack_almanac> look at that angry boys art
[0:34:05] <+cha0tic_klutch> That was you attacking him blocking. His card now allows him to attack even though it’s your turn
[0:34:08] <munitalprats> i always loved tryndameres level up art
[0:34:11] <pennykettle_> tyrandamere vs a quick attack is Kreygasm
[0:34:11] <waterstealer> poro
[0:34:11] <MyNameIsRasus> block with poro, braum generates them for free
[0:34:12] <munitalprats> its fucking rad
[0:34:22] <+MarcN0tMark> poro
[0:34:26] <GingaNZ> poro
[0:34:31] <waterstealer> poros are free
[0:34:32] <dds333a> Interesting that they give you an option to not declare block at all
[0:34:32] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:34:37] <iosephe> Do you need to block all that damage?
[0:34:47] <%Juriasu> ANGERY
[0:34:47] <dds333a> and he's back
[0:34:49] <munitalprats> fuckin' love his level up art
[0:34:49] <trustiano> SMOrc SMOrc SMOrc
[0:34:50] <lazysaiyajin> holy crap
[0:34:51] <waterstealer> ANGERY
[0:34:51] <+Ricky_Rexx> He don't yieeld
[0:34:53] <An_Armed_Bear> oh yeah he got tough now
[0:35:00] <pennykettle_> wait did they change him? He has tough?
[0:35:00] <Drizzydre116> Just attack now
[0:35:04] <GingaNZ> double mad
[0:35:05] <pennykettle_> And more health?
[0:35:09] <MyNameIsRasus> if he thinks these animations are fancy, wait until he sees the shurima ones
[0:35:12] <Safarihat> @pennykettle_ recent buff
[0:35:14] <Drizzydre116> dont give him a chance to put more units down
[0:35:14] <dds333a> Now Lux I recognize LUL
[0:35:16] <+coldsama> @pennykettle_ they buffed many underused champions recently
[0:35:16] <+Zyquux> @dds333a sometimes you want to keep your units (especially champs) alive and sacrifice nexus health instead.
[0:35:18] <+denizen_conspirator> double the trynd and end
[0:35:18] <munitalprats> @pennykettle_ He had tough originally in the beta, they nerfed it and then recently gave it back to him
[0:35:19] <waterstealer> champs cant be stolen
[0:35:19] <+denizen_conspirator> imo
[0:35:22] <%Juriasu> @dds333a Kappa
[0:35:25] <An_Armed_Bear> Hush makes Trynd sad
[0:35:28] <Jaysky> You can also capture him
[0:35:29] <+Zyquux> Viego PepeLaugh
[0:35:32] <Crombells> the weakness here is you can only run 6 champs
[0:35:33] <pennykettle_> @MyNameIsRasus "forcing my opponent to watch the whole ass shurima cinematic universe"
[0:35:33] <Daxalog> Only one faction has tht sort of thing
[0:35:34] <Aaronc123425> yes they can
[0:35:38] <munitalprats> they totally can
[0:35:38] <+goose_attack_almanac> God I hate Viego
[0:35:39] <+PikeBot> There is one card effect that steals temporarily
[0:35:39] <pennykettle_> one guy
[0:35:39] <munitalprats> with Detain
[0:35:40] <waterstealer> no they cant
[0:35:42] <MyNameIsRasus> in this game, it's more of a "you may be dead before you can cast them"
[0:35:49] <Jaysky> Capture/Detain
[0:35:49] <mrtanaka111> in runeterra teh danger of big cards is being countered in anyway and losing the turn
[0:35:50] <+disgruntledgruntle> Viego kills Champs in LoR
[0:35:52] <Nikbottom> a lot of removal cant hit champs
[0:35:52] <waterstealer> they can't be used by the enemy
[0:35:59] <Safarihat> detain is removal
[0:36:00] <GingaNZ> lol time to die
[0:36:01] <Deasmeister> night night
[0:36:04] <+Zyquux> Viego kills champs, steals followers
[0:36:04] <waterstealer> you can use removal but you cant steal them
[0:36:05] <+patel347> use the eye on the left to see outcomes
[0:36:06] <trustiano> JUST GO FACE SMOrc
[0:36:07] <pacibuddy> TIMMY
[0:36:08] <%Juriasu> is there trample?
[0:36:09] <dds333a> @zyquux woah, Champs contribute to like defense? there's the actual lifetotal, as well as Champs?
[0:36:10] <Nikbottom> Fearsome
[0:36:14] <+chase959> braum pulls the poror and you win auto
[0:36:16] <+nial_evol> have braum chain the 3/3
[0:36:16] <MyNameIsRasus> pull the poro with braum
[0:36:19] <munitalprats> BIG TIMMY card
[0:36:19] <Nikbottom> so scary
[0:36:22] <trustiano> @Juriasu Yes is called overwhelm
[0:36:24] <lazysaiyajin> trample & menace+1
[0:36:28] <waterstealer> next message
[0:36:29] <Equirah> oh no, runeterra
[0:36:36] <%Juriasu> @Juriasu thx
[0:36:37] <munitalprats> i fuckin' loved this art
[0:36:38] <waterstealer> SICK
[0:36:42] <GingaNZ> beserker
[0:36:42] <munitalprats> with the big yeti rocking out with him
[0:36:44] <Aaronc123425> viego awill take champs and posseison will take cards for a round
[0:36:47] <Jaysky> Local man too angry to die
[0:36:55] <munitalprats> @Aaronc123425 viego kills champions.
[0:36:58] <Kalcom> viego doesn't take champs
[0:36:59] <+probably_facetious> Just win lol
[0:36:59] <pennykettle_> BM
[0:37:03] <+patel347> put him in the middle
[0:37:05] <+disgruntledgruntle> @Aaronc123425 Viego kills champos, steals units
[0:37:06] <+goose_attack_almanac> @Aaronc123425 Viego kills champs or steals your strongest minion
[0:37:07] <pacibuddy> In league tryndamere's ult is him becoming unkillabe for a minute
[0:37:10] <munitalprats> It matters
[0:37:16] <iosephe> distance
[0:37:17] <pennykettle_> prevent accidents I guess
[0:37:17] <waterstealer> it matters
[0:37:17] <Daxalog> That matters
[0:37:19] <gyrobasel> @pacibuddy 5 seconds*
[0:37:20] <Nikbottom> for phones
[0:37:22] <%CaptainPileDriver> i keep reading "mighty poro" as mighty poo
[0:37:24] <Mundkipz> easier to swipe on phone
[0:37:24] <+chase959> it's the use
[0:37:26] <+Abii_Artesian> Heyy @woolieversus how are you? :)
[0:37:27] <AnnaLamb> just incase people accidentally play stuff
[0:37:28] <Safarihat> its a mobile game
[0:37:28] <+ItsRatman> So you can actually drag stuff on mobile
[0:37:28] <MyNameIsRasus> to prevent accidents
[0:37:29] <+Zyquux> @dds333a The nexus health is the 20 on the right, but champs are valuable, often game winning conditions. letting them die on defence can be a waste of their power.
[0:37:31] <waterstealer> you cant choose where it is on the board unless you attack
[0:37:33] <%jolene_orenji> chat what's that champion that lets you summon a ghost of an enemy champion if you kill them (in normal league not runeterra)
[0:37:43] <MyNameIsRasus> @jolene_orenji kalista
[0:37:45] <+Zyquux> @dds333a sorry nexus health is on the left LUL
[0:37:50] <+goose_attack_almanac> @jolene_orenji Used to be Mordekaiser.
[0:37:51] <+disgruntledgruntle> Lissandra?
[0:37:53] <munitalprats> @jolene_orenji he doesn't exist anymore it was old mordekaiser
[0:37:55] <Frostydough1> @jolene_orenji it used to be mordekaisers old ult thats not longer his ult
[0:38:01] <MyNameIsRasus> oh normal leageu
[0:38:02] <Daxalog> Yorick was the reviver
[0:38:05] <waterstealer> yeah its better on pc imho
[0:38:06] <+ItsRatman> @jolene_orenji that's a lot of them these days

[0:38:11] <dds333a> @zyquux oh, I see thanks. it's about the strategy.
[0:38:16] <gyrobasel> @jolene_orenji it used to be old mordekaiser but that got removed, closes thing now is lissandra passive that summons an exploding ice ghost of a champ she just killed
[0:38:18] <Drizzydre116> Is this running on bluestacks or is there a PC version of the game?
[0:38:22] <laguerrilha> GG
[0:38:24] <+Zyquux> @dds333a yep, cost vs reward
[0:38:24] <waterstealer> gg
[0:38:27] <MyNameIsRasus> Pc version
[0:38:27] <+patel347> have you tried out labs yet?
[0:38:27] <laguerrilha> gg wp
[0:38:27] <+MarcN0tMark> woolieCHAN
[0:38:29] <munitalprats> @Drizzydre116 there's a PC version
[0:38:30] <pennykettle_> you can also hold down mouse when picking units to attack to scoop em up
[0:38:33] <+goose_attack_almanac> @Drizzydre116 there is a pc version adna mobile version
[0:38:34] <MyNameIsRasus> ez clap
[0:38:36] <%jolene_orenji> @gyrobasel z
[0:38:38] <%jolene_orenji> fuck
[0:38:39] <Drizzydre116> Dope
[0:38:39] <Nikbottom> @patel347 he can't lab yet
[0:38:43] <%Juriasu> it ACTUALLY was the friedns we made along the way
[0:38:45] <%jolene_orenji> @gyrobasel I was thinking of mordekaiser ty
[0:38:52] <waterstealer> yeah the game should be over by then
[0:38:52] <munitalprats> Pretty much
[0:38:58] <munitalprats> the time Tryndamere comes down either you're winning or losing
[0:38:58] <+Zyquux> @pennykettle_ I think on PC you can also press A to full attack
[0:38:59] <dds333a> This is pretty neato.
[0:39:01] <%Jeklesworth> @WoolieVersus A huge part of the gameplay for runeterra is that the turns are less traditional you pass actions back and forth instead of normal turns
[0:39:05] <+probably_facetious> Or a removal spell,yeah
[0:39:09] <pennykettle_> Zyquux I would be too scared about that because of order haha
[0:39:10] <+Ricky_Rexx> Look at all those numbers going up
[0:39:11] <+patel347> @Nikbottom ah I see
[0:39:11] <MyNameIsRasus> there is a lot of counterplay
[0:39:11] <waterstealer> ugh lux
[0:39:12] <GingaNZ> don't let him get started pretty much
[0:39:18] <%Juriasu> oh yeah baby shove me into the skinner box
[0:39:19] <gyrobasel> @WoolieVersus are you gonna try wild rift when it drops on console?
[0:39:20] <+Zyquux> Lux <3
[0:39:29] <%TomoeMoeGozen> TomoeMoeGozen subscribed with Prime. 
[0:39:35] <+goose_attack_almanac> Board order can matter in some cases because there are spells and abilities that can damage all your cards even the backline. and it's usually done from left side of the board to the right side.
[0:39:39] <GingaNZ> it's the best part, but it's confusing
[0:39:42] <waterstealer> its a nice rhythm once you figure it out
[0:39:43] <MyNameIsRasus> turns contain multiple actions
[0:39:47] <pennykettle_> theres a difference between turns and rounds
[0:39:48] <dds333a> @tomoemoegozen is a damn good name
[0:39:48] <+Ricky_Rexx> More unique than the average card game in that way
[0:39:50] <+Zyquux> @pennykettle_ yeah me too, but it's satisfying if you are running a no brain full aggro deck
[0:39:55] <+MarcN0tMark> its possible to just get bad hands back to back unfortunately
[0:39:58] <Nikbottom> Lets talk about the Stack in MTG
[0:40:02] <pacibuddy> this game has "do nothing" mindgames its the best
[0:40:04] <munitalprats> aww yeah FREE CARDSKINS
[0:40:06] <+Ricky_Rexx> LOOT
[0:40:08] <munitalprats> or card shinys
[0:40:11] <waterstealer> JUDGEMENT
[0:40:12] <munitalprats> these are fixed btw
[0:40:13] <Nikbottom> you can
[0:40:15] <dds333a> @nikbottom let's CarlSmile
[0:40:15] <FassieFons> DOPAMINE PogChamp
[0:40:15] <+disgruntledgruntle> Farron!
[0:40:15] <+probably_facetious> Manipulating action priority in Runeterra is as important as timing in Teppen
[0:40:16] <trustiano> CARD SKINS
[0:40:21] <+Zyquux> SPIN TO WIN
[0:40:23] <munitalprats> as in you always get these 3
[0:40:25] <waterstealer> you can click the eye
[0:40:25] <Johannen> Shinys?
[0:40:28] <%Juriasu> if the game auto advances the enemy will know you don't have anything you can do and therefore gain information Is my guess why auto advance is off by default
[0:40:28] <munitalprats> to choose from
[0:40:28] <waterstealer> for the art
[0:40:28] <+l3sovikk> Just card shinies
[0:40:30] <pennykettle_> They recently changed it so cards you dont own are greyed out :/
[0:40:32] <+xerotwo> JUDGEMENT KNIGHTS OF doodScrub
[0:40:32] <CruxAustralis> Empyrean is a pretty Pog card
[0:40:35] <An_Armed_Bear> Farron is lit

[0:40:35] <+denizen_conspirator> love to watch Woolie will figure it out live
[0:40:35] <waterstealer> ionia!
[0:40:37] <Safarihat> captain farron is beast mode
[0:40:40] <+Kiefer_Suthrland> So you'll support this but don't want to support SNK anymore, what's the difference?
[0:40:46] <MyNameIsRasus> essence is for cosmetic
[0:40:53] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> the gacha soothes, the gacha welcomes all
[0:40:55] <+Zyquux> Shiny cards that generate cards will also make the generated cards shiny
[0:40:59] <dds333a> Took me a while before I considered myself brave enough to use Instants in MTG LUL
[0:41:03] <+Bricespresso> how are you liking it woolz?
[0:41:07] <+denizen_conspirator> @Kiefer_Suthrland uhh...the owners of SNK murdered a journalist
[0:41:08] <munitalprats> DEAL **DAMAGE**
[0:41:10] <munitalprats> big unga
[0:41:10] <+Debuggingfool> I really tried to get into this game but auto battlers like tft and autochess scratches a similar itch without the need to drop cash every 3 months to stay relevant with the meta
[0:41:14] <+disgruntledgruntle> try scouts
[0:41:23] <waterstealer> SPIDERS
[0:41:25] <pennykettle_> Pirate booby deck
[0:41:28] <+Zyquux> it's a shame he's coming in at the end of the event. the event has a lot of free stuff in it.
[0:41:30] <waterstealer> JINX VALENTINE

[0:41:55] <An_Armed_Bear> So simple yet so effective
[0:41:56] <+probably_facetious> My favorite old deck was a scouts and ninjas deck
[0:41:56] <+Zyquux> @woolieversus The Scouts and Scoundrels deck is good for attack token shenanigans
[0:42:07] <munitalprats> this is an aggro deck
[0:42:12] <waterstealer> yeah kinda
[0:42:13] <+l3sovikk> Super aggro deck

[0:42:14] <dds333a> @munitalprats I don't know what I'm talking about, and even I know that's out there
[0:42:15] <+denizen_conspirator> @Debuggingfool play like, half an hour a day, and earn a new deck top to bottom every 2 weeks or so
[0:42:15] <mrtanaka111> left
[0:42:16] <MyNameIsRasus> kind of
[0:42:16] <munitalprats> It's super aggro
[0:42:20] <Daxalog> Black Red
[0:42:23] <AsterisTV> You pretty much smash their nexus with spiders and big numbers
[0:42:24] <waterstealer> undying is the shit
[0:42:25] <MyNameIsRasus> it's super aggro
[0:42:27] <waterstealer> undying is sigma
[0:42:27] <AnnaLamb> black smorc
[0:42:30] <pennykettle_> Yes I love Shadow Isles
[0:42:35] <+probably_facetious> It's more red than black.

[0:42:43] <waterstealer> LUCIAN
[0:42:45] <waterstealer> YEE
[0:42:45] <sparked963> Miss Fortune is a lot of fun but shes so weak
[0:42:48] <munitalprats> but it's more midrangy
[0:42:48] <MyNameIsRasus> garen and lux are not in
[0:42:49] <sparked963> Lucian is clutch
[0:42:49] <+Zyquux> I love the scouts decks
[0:42:56] <An_Armed_Bear> Miss Fortune weak what
[0:43:00] <dds333a> @waterstealer "Refuse to die" -Octillionaire Sigma Grindset
[0:43:03] <munitalprats> Missfortune isn't weak

[0:43:08] <GingaNZ> you deck is the left cards
[0:43:10] <Nikbottom> Boxtopus has the best voice lines
[0:43:12] <pennykettle_> Your deck is on the left, youre looking at cards from the regions of that deck
[0:43:15] <Crombells> they aren't in your deck unless there's a filled dot under the card, check the list on the left instead
[0:43:17] <+Zyquux> Giving MF overwhelm again was a great choice
[0:43:17] <An_Armed_Bear> Miss Fortune's one of Bilge's best champs lol
[0:43:18] <munitalprats> aww yeah SPOODER TIME
[0:43:19] <+CoogiDown2MySocks> trying runeterra?
[0:43:20] <pennykettle_> some of those arent in the deck, just compatible cards
[0:43:22] <+denizen_conspirator> @sparked963 She's one of my fave decks, keep her in the backline, use scouts to level her, absolutely required to play her turn 3 if you can
[0:43:25] <Daxalog> @WoolieVersus Your looking at the wrong crds
[0:43:27] <waterstealer> oh boy
[0:43:29] <Kalcom> scout is the weird one
[0:43:29] <+probably_facetious> @sparked963 Never used her with scouts and rally, I take it?
[0:43:36] <Nikbottom> Kill the Ghosts

[0:43:44] <+goose_attack_almanac> @denizen_conspirator She's fun with Irelia and all the Blade dance cards for Ionia
[0:43:45] <macmens> fun fact a deck like this was the first to reach masters in the open beta
[0:43:47] <%GinAndRoses> spookies
[0:43:54] <%CaptainPileDriver> btw, getting this in early, all may players are bad
[0:43:57] <waterstealer> he's guts

[0:44:21] <%PirateDad_> The dunk master
[0:44:22] <Daxalog> Hes not even that evil
[0:44:24] <munitalprats> he just gets stat boosts
[0:44:27] <BimboBagging> he's actually a good father LUL
[0:44:29] <pacibuddy> generic soldier man who is BALLING
[0:44:30] <munitalprats> He gets +5 attack
[0:44:32] <sparked963> @denizen_conspirator Weak as in she dies easy. She clears the field and deals damage but killing her can easily be a 1 spell process
[0:44:35] <munitalprats> he's a finisher card
[0:44:37] <pennykettle_> its sonic and shadow
[0:44:40] <%mr_sups> Garen has a Sword. Darius has an Axe. That's all you need to know.
[0:44:42] <dds333a> Spider chick, right
[0:44:42] <gyrobasel> cant wait for when noxus just say fuck it and decide to nuke ionia in the lore

[0:47:05] <+l3sovikk> good trade here
[0:47:06] <An_Armed_Bear> Isn't the whole "Black widows kill their mates" thing overstated?
[0:47:10] <%PirateDad_> Jeff the spider
[0:47:12] <pacibuddy> battle of the scared men
[0:47:15] <+froduck42> is he a spider or a scorpion?
[0:47:16] <Safarihat> @An_Armed_Bear no
[0:47:17] <laguerrilha> Any Fiddlesticks deck?
[0:47:18] <mrtanaka111> @An_Armed_Bear not if youre the mate
[0:47:21] <AnnaLamb> @pennykettle_ the older one or the kid?
[0:47:27] <dds333a> @plague_doctor_d as they should. flavor text is my big favorite
[0:47:30] <pennykettle_> AnnaLamb lmao the older one
[0:47:34] <+Zyquux> @laguerrilha Fiddle isn't in yet sadly
[0:47:39] <+Ricky_Rexx> Now I'm trying to think of male spider characters besides Spiderman
[0:47:40] <laguerrilha> awwwww
[0:47:43] <waterstealer> i gave up league for runeterra
[0:47:46] <munitalprats> that's smart
[0:47:53] <+Ricky_Rexx> Don't say it like that
[0:47:53] <waterstealer> thats smart
[0:47:54] <+nial_evol> well that's what this deck wants to do lol
[0:47:55] <Safarihat> you want that trade
[0:47:58] <waterstealer> oof
[0:48:01] <MyNameIsRasus> in this specific case you wanted to trade
[0:48:04] <+Zyquux> I imagine Fiddle will have something to do with creating scarecrow tokens
[0:48:04] <cs0402196> Wild Rift on Digital Controls is harsh on my left thumb joint.
[0:48:10] <%GinAndRoses> you want them spooders
[0:48:18] <waterstealer> CANT BLOCK
[0:48:29] <gyrobasel> @waterstealer i gave up league for wild rift lol, its biggest most glaring flaw is that its not on pc and doesnt have official controller support yet
[0:48:33] <+ItsRatman> He cannot hold down and back
[0:48:33] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:48:46] <dds333a> @zyquux isn't he also the guy who slings explosives around?
[0:48:55] <+Ricky_Rexx> What actually is Wild Rift? I've heard of it but don't follow Riot games much
[0:49:00] <waterstealer> i suppose. still, i like runeterra more
[0:49:06] <pennykettle_> console version, simpler @Ricky_Rexx
[0:49:10] <Nikbottom> just a dude fishin
[0:49:12] <gyrobasel> @Ricky_Rexx watered down version of league pc
[0:49:12] <munitalprats> @Zyquux I want fiddle to randomly appear from someone elses deck
[0:49:13] <+goose_attack_almanac> @Ricky_Rexx it's going to be a mobile and console version of standard league
[0:49:14] <Daxalog> Wild Rift is the partial port of the moba tophones
[0:49:14] <Mundkipz> nooooo
[0:49:15] <iosephe> Swap the blocks
[0:49:16] <lazysaiyajin> switch
[0:49:16] <AnnaLamb> @Ricky_Rexx simplified phone version of league.
[0:49:18] <Kalcom> what
[0:49:19] <+nial_evol> oh god what
[0:49:19] <sparked963> swap them woolie
[0:49:20] <+Ricky_Rexx> Oh
[0:49:21] <+goose_attack_almanac> wja
[0:49:24] <Jaysky> I haven't played League at all in years but Runeterra is a great card game
[0:49:24] <waterstealer> ehh
[0:49:25] <+goose_attack_almanac> but why
[0:49:27] <Mundkipz> why let elise take two dmg lol
[0:49:27] <munitalprats> should have swapped them
[0:49:28] <+Zyquux> @dds333a Not Fiddle. you might be thinking of Ziggs (who also isn't in yet)
[0:49:37] <waterstealer> attack
[0:49:37] <+Ricky_Rexx> Interesting, was console league something people wanted?
[0:49:40] <+MarcN0tMark> spiders trust
[0:49:45] <+xerotwo> Uh oops LUL
[0:49:50] <+FuqBoiSlim> Can someone explain this in fighting game terms?
[0:49:51] <waterstealer> they cant block elise with the poro
[0:49:55] <+nial_evol> the 1hp could have done that
[0:49:56] <+disgruntledgruntle> just attack with Elise then play the stun spider tolevel elise
[0:49:57] <%TomoeMoeGozen> the 1/1 was gonna die anyway
[0:49:59] <Mundkipz> the guy had only 1 hp
[0:49:59] <@Menitta> Runeterra hug
[0:50:00] <Daxalog> You dont always want your hero units to take damage
[0:50:03] <+Zyquux> @munitalprats funnily enough, Jarven kind of does that already
[0:50:04] <@Menitta> huh*
[0:50:04] <+goose_attack_almanac> the other guy woulda done that too
[0:50:05] <iosephe> that follower didn't have overwhelm
[0:50:10] <+MarcN0tMark> sometimes its ok to take the hit
[0:50:12] <munitalprats> @Zyquux he doesn't though, he comes from hand
[0:50:17] <dds333a> @zyquux the short guy is Ziggs, right? Fiddlesticks (?)is the scarecrow. yeah, I think I had them confused
[0:50:21] <%nintega010> Oh Sion
[0:50:21] <munitalprats> I want Fiddle to come from the opponents DECK
[0:50:26] <waterstealer> they cant block elise right now
[0:50:30] <+probably_facetious> Stun! Elise evolves next turn!
[0:50:35] <pennykettle_> Do yall ever level up Elise? I just use her as a token generator
[0:50:37] <%nintega010> I thought I saw Sion
[0:50:40] <+patel347> its also a spider
[0:50:42] <+Zyquux> @munitalprats yeah, but the idea is there. I bet fiddle will do something similar
[0:50:43] <+patel347> if you look at the top
[0:50:44] <GingaNZ> oddly pass is a good idea
[0:50:45] <munitalprats> @pennykettle_ she's annoying to level usually
[0:50:45] <waterstealer> sion isnt in the game yet
[0:50:46] <sparked963> He still has Mana so he can summon after Stun
[0:50:49] <Johannen> Is that a ghost shark?
[0:50:53] <lazysaiyajin> nice
[0:50:54] <+Zyquux> @dds333a yeah, you got it
[0:50:56] <Johannen> With a collar on?
[0:51:02] <waterstealer> dont attack
[0:51:03] <munitalprats> easy pass :p
[0:51:04] <AnnaLamb> @Johannen shark ghost?
[0:51:07] <+disgruntledgruntle> just pass
[0:51:07] <waterstealer> he has ephemeral
[0:51:13] <+MarcN0tMark> its ephemeral it will die
[0:51:14] <waterstealer> he dies at the end of the turn
[0:51:21] <munitalprats> read the spiders keywords

[0:51:21] <+Zyquux> The shark chariots flavor text is great
[0:51:22] <+MarcN0tMark> just wait it out
[0:51:22] <MyNameIsRasus> he has ephemeral, he'll die at the end of the turn
[0:51:23] <macmens> better to pass
[0:51:23] <+goose_attack_almanac> check the other keyword
[0:51:25] <munitalprats> ephemeral
[0:51:26] <%GinAndRoses> he'll die anyway
[0:51:27] <+probably_facetious> Just pass, it'll die anyway
[0:51:35] <Daxalog> When are they adding void creatures to runetera? Feels like the void just got completely ignored
[0:51:36] <GingaNZ> pass
[0:51:44] <iosephe> It's your attack
[0:51:44] <sparked963> Pass is a good choice often
[0:51:48] <MyNameIsRasus> you're on the attack, there'll be no damage coming
[0:51:49] <pacibuddy> @Daxalog rek'sai is in the game already i think
[0:51:50] <+disgruntledgruntle> no damage, it can't attack
[0:51:54] <+goose_attack_almanac> @Daxalog rek sai is in it but those are probably coming
[0:51:55] <munitalprats> @Daxalog void is confirmed to not be a region, so if they come out they aren't gonna be in their own region
[0:51:56] <waterstealer> wail but you cant afford it
[0:51:57] <Safarihat> @Daxalog there are void creatures in game already
[0:51:57] <+Ricky_Rexx> They can't attack oh yeeah
[0:52:03] <+patel347> you dont take any damge this turn because yotu have attack token
[0:52:04] <%nintega010> @daxalog probably when they add Kasadin
[0:52:08] <iosephe> you don't need it right now?
[0:52:14] <Nikbottom> "what's Healing?" - Noxis
[0:52:15] <+Zyquux> Void is going get spread between all the regions.
[0:52:21] <waterstealer> pass
[0:52:48] <+MarcN0tMark> take the hit and then drain
[0:52:56] <iosephe> Play the Rearguard
[0:53:00] <%nintega010> there is a lot of big bad enemies in league. shadow isles is one.
[0:53:08] <munitalprats> might aswell play rearguard imo
[0:53:19] <waterstealer> yeah good play
[0:53:19] <An_Armed_Bear> play rearguard, bank the 3 spell mana?
[0:53:20] <+ProxyAskew> you can use burst and fast spells in the middle of combat
[0:53:28] <waterstealer> block spooder with 3 power spooder
[0:53:29] <+patel347> might aswell take the damage
[0:53:30] <munitalprats> 3/2 blocks the 1/1?
[0:53:32] <+patel347> since you heal
[0:53:37] <MyNameIsRasus> save might for attack
[0:53:41] <+probably_facetious> Just eat the damage and drain
[0:53:45] <Mundkipz> if elise had one more hp she could block a 1/1
[0:53:49] <dmtjinni> WOOLZ
[0:54:02] <Hirumm> was that Titus Hardie's VA?
[0:54:03] <%wardogleader15> wardogleader15 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! One whole year! Here is to many more, hope you have a good week Woolie!
[0:54:07] <+crisdamighty68> tank it for now
[0:54:08] <waterstealer> wow
[0:54:09] <waterstealer> ok
[0:54:12] <munitalprats> health is a resource
[0:54:13] <+crisdamighty68> yes
[0:54:13] <waterstealer> i mean sure
[0:54:20] <waterstealer> health as a resource
[0:54:25] <93lobo> you get alot more profit by not blocking
[0:54:25] <munitalprats> just bank the spellmana
[0:54:25] <Kalcom> you only need 1 hp
[0:54:31] <waterstealer> you can cast might but you shouldnt
[0:54:34] <+Izendale> Yeah don't be scared to take damage
[0:54:35] <Mundkipz> pass and bank the mana
[0:54:38] <93lobo> its because you have a burst spell in your hand
[0:54:38] <+probably_facetious> Just keep the mana
[0:54:38] <pennykettle_> you could theoretically play might
[0:54:39] <+Abd0022> just pass
[0:54:39] <munitalprats> just pass and bank the mana
[0:54:40] <+Zyquux> 5 damage is nothing for a Shadow Isles drain deck
[0:54:40] <MyNameIsRasus> you could cast shit if you wanted
[0:54:43] <Crombells> it only switches rounds once both players have passed without doing anything consecutively
[0:54:44] <93lobo> that highlighted blue card
[0:54:46] <pennykettle_> you can play might, but you dont want to
[0:54:46] <waterstealer> you can cast might but you shouldn't
[0:54:47] <+PikeBot> You coulkd play more guys in preparation for next turn
[0:54:48] <iosephe> You could cast Might, but you shouldn't
[0:54:50] <+patel347> there could be other spells
[0:54:51] <lazysaiyajin> semantics. its useful on later rounds
[0:54:51] <AnnaLamb> you could use the spell.
[0:54:52] <+goose_attack_almanac> You can summon or cast after being attacked
[0:54:52] <93lobo> It's because of the blue card
[0:54:53] <MyNameIsRasus> you could cast might
[0:54:54] <Deasmeister> spells and put down units
[0:54:54] <%TomoeMoeGozen> because you could play a card if you had one
[0:54:54] <+Scevda> Pat just got on Pokemon. Main stream weekend seems to be the theme
[0:54:54] <munitalprats> Because you can use might
[0:54:54] <Mundkipz> gives you a chance to make a mistake
[0:54:59] <Drizzydre116> to play burst spells
[0:54:59] <93lobo> It gives you a chance to play it
[0:55:00] <+ProxyAskew> you could still cast that spell. you shouldn't but the game doesn't know you don't wanna cast it.
[0:55:02] <+MGSKomodoDragon> you have options, thats why
[0:55:02] <+PikeBot> Woolie, you have a card you could play! It would be a bad play, but you could!@
[0:55:03] <Learner621> It's because you do have a card you could play yeah
[0:55:04] <+probably_facetious> Because you could possibly play
[0:55:05] <Crombells> there is a setting to make it pass automatically if you can't play anything
[0:55:09] <trustiano> Bluff a card.
[0:55:12] <+Zyquux> there's some spells you want to wait until they don't have anything left to counter it with
[0:55:13] <OblivionSword1> because you have something that you can play
[0:55:13] <GingaNZ> that will be useful later with complex decks
[0:55:16] <MyNameIsRasus> you had enough
[0:55:17] <%TomoeMoeGozen> a spell or just a normal card
[0:55:21] <+probably_facetious> WAIT
[0:55:22] <%TomoeMoeGozen> anything really
[0:55:23] <An_Armed_Bear> if the enemy just attacks immediately
[0:55:23] <Kalcom> spider
[0:55:25] <munitalprats> play spider
[0:55:26] <An_Armed_Bear> which is often
[0:55:27] <munitalprats> maybe
[0:55:28] <%GinAndRoses> spider
[0:55:29] <%AyotoCorp> @WoolieVersus Attackers can also attack before the other player has a chance to put down anything
[0:55:30] <MyNameIsRasus> spider guy
[0:55:31] <+AnIrishPapaya> Cool that you're checking this game out! I for one will not backseat game. Hope you enjoy the playthrough
[0:55:33] <+Abd0022> play the spide
[0:55:34] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1420054806341816326?s=19
[0:55:34] <Mundkipz> i think it gives you a chance to fool opponent to thinking you have a card
[0:55:35] <pennykettle_> you did have enough, you had 3 and Might cost 3. It was a bad play but you could
[0:55:35] <+probably_facetious> Drain when the big thing blocks
[0:55:36] <munitalprats> arachnoid host
[0:55:37] <macmens> play big spider you can heal next turn
[0:55:38] <+disgruntledgruntle> play spider
[0:55:46] <whirly25> this is where I'd play my spells, If I had any!
[0:55:47] <laguerrilha> you can have now
[0:55:47] <waterstealer> plau spooder
[0:55:49] <dds333a> @ginganz oh man, I bet this game goes PLACES
[0:55:50] <93lobo> Elise has fear play grasp on the big spider and attack
[0:55:54] <+patel347> it says round start
[0:55:55] <waterstealer> dont attack
[0:55:58] <+Abd0022> round start
[0:56:01] <93lobo> to late
[0:56:02] <+disgruntledgruntle> Attack with rearguard only
[0:56:03] <%TomoeMoeGozen> so next round
[0:56:09] <waterstealer> attack with rearguard
[0:56:13] <Crombells> you can attack freely with the no block dude
[0:56:17] <+Zyquux> @woolieversus just something to remember: if the an overwhelm unit's blocker does to a spell or other effect, the ENTIRE attack will go through
[0:56:18] <+patel347> 2 hp challenger
[0:56:23] <iosephe> Rearguard attack might bait them into blocking with Thresh
[0:56:25] <lazysaiyajin> yoooo
[0:56:31] <munitalprats> It's so your little spiders can pull targets so you can swarm the board and attack through them
[0:56:37] <+disgruntledgruntle> Rearguard only
[0:56:39] <%TomoeMoeGozen> she also gets hotter :)
[0:56:40] <munitalprats> attack with rearguard
[0:56:40] <iosephe> (and then you kill it with Might)
[0:56:41] <+patel347> you can attack with the other guy
[0:56:44] <munitalprats> ohwell
[0:56:47] <An_Armed_Bear> Rearguard tho
[0:56:50] <+Izendale> I assume this is currently pve? I just got on
[0:56:56] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> >sbussy is workin' it
[0:57:01] <adelym0> @Izendale yeah he's vs an ai deck
[0:57:04] <+Zyquux> @izendale yeah, just bots for now
[0:57:06] <+patel347> now that shes leveled you can sacrifice spiders
[0:57:06] <sparked963> The level ups are so good in this game
[0:57:09] <pennykettle_> yeah he is playing an AI, hasnt unlocked pvp yet
[0:57:27] <Johannen> The only HP that matters is the difference between 1 and 0
[0:57:29] <+Izendale> Yeye, Lot has pretty fun pve modes anyway
[0:57:32] <+goose_attack_almanac> high aggression deck
[0:57:36] <Mundkipz> aggro probably not your style, you're suppose to hit hard and fast
[0:57:37] <+MGSKomodoDragon> its more aggro. summon little guys and swarm
[0:57:44] <+Zyquux> SMOrc FACE GOOD SMOrc
[0:57:51] <munitalprats> Aggro actually takes a brain despite common memes
[0:57:56] <+patel347> you can sacrifice spiders now
[0:57:57] <pennykettle_> @Johannen I agree with the idea but not when the enemy can deal more damage via spells
[0:58:02] <Loving_Fox> MY ASS IS READY
[0:58:08] <munitalprats> don't play might yet
[0:58:08] <Jaysky> "My Ass is ready" - Darius
[0:58:12] <An_Armed_Bear> unless it's old Azirelia
[0:58:12] <%TomoeMoeGozen> not now
[0:58:14] <MyNameIsRasus> you could cast, just no reason
[0:58:14] <iosephe> Don't
[0:58:14] <munitalprats> It's just telling you that you can play it
[0:58:15] <%TomoeMoeGozen> wait for the attack
[0:58:16] <munitalprats> just pass
[0:58:17] <waterstealer> you can cast might since you have 3 mana
[0:58:18] <An_Armed_Bear> No brain needed there lol
[0:58:18] <waterstealer> but dont
[0:58:19] <+probably_facetious> Don't be afraid to paas
[0:58:19] <MyNameIsRasus> pass
[0:58:19] <lazysaiyajin> pas
[0:58:20] <+patel347> save might for attacking
[0:58:23] <waterstealer> NO
[0:58:24] <+probably_facetious> WAIT
[0:58:24] <GingaNZ> nope
[0:58:26] <%TomoeMoeGozen> you can cast later woolie
[0:58:27] <+disgruntledgruntle> save for attacking
[0:58:28] <Johannen> @pennykettle_ Its a heneral idea of using your health as a resource
[0:58:28] <Crombells> no reason to cast it yet
[0:58:30] <+Abd0022> save for attack
[0:58:31] <%TomoeMoeGozen> you can cast during the attack
[0:58:33] <munitalprats> It's burst speed, you can cast it whenever
[0:58:33] <Hirumm> pass
[0:58:35] <%GinAndRoses> save for attack yeah
[0:58:37] <Mundkipz> it lets you trick your opponent into thinking you have a card... they can see what you mouse over
[0:58:37] <+Zyquux> "give" means it only lasts for the round
[0:58:39] <pennykettle_> @Johannen yea I agree with that
[0:58:42] <An_Armed_Bear> lol ai
[0:58:43] <munitalprats> See?

[0:59:04] <waterstealer> play might on the guy thresh pulled
[0:59:06] <MyNameIsRasus> You can use might now to off Thresh, you don't want to let him level up
[0:59:06] <sparked963> u can kill thresh with might
[0:59:17] <%TomoeMoeGozen> use burst on the reargaurd
[0:59:17] <munitalprats> you can use might on the rearguard
[0:59:18] <+disgruntledgruntle> Block with small spiders, save elise
[0:59:18] <+erro232> Woolie hover over the blue eye on the left. It gives you the outcome of the round
[0:59:18] <+cha0tic_klutch> Eye on the left
[0:59:18] <+probably_facetious> Might can kill Thresh
[0:59:21] <waterstealer> play might on him

[0:59:37] <pennykettle_> Woolie do you know about the eye between both players' nexus? It shows whatll happen when combat or spells resolve
[0:59:38] <munitalprats> PogChamp
[0:59:39] <laguerrilha> good good
[0:59:40] <MyNameIsRasus> yeah, read, thresh level up to understand why
[0:59:40] <munitalprats> no it won't
[0:59:40] <GingaNZ> nice
[0:59:42] <waterstealer> no its not
[0:59:43] <MyNameIsRasus> no it wont
[0:59:43] <lazysaiyajin> "Trap card activated"
[0:59:44] <munitalprats> He's blocking because of thresh
[0:59:46] <An_Armed_Bear> No he doesn't have overwhelm
[0:59:46] <+goose_attack_almanac> no it won't
[0:59:50] <+disgruntledgruntle> Don't block with Elise
[0:59:53] <waterstealer> thresh doesnt have overwhem
[1:00:03] <waterstealer> no
[1:00:03] <Mundkipz> nooooo
[1:00:04] <An_Armed_Bear> Use the 3/1
[1:00:05] <+Zyquux> overwhelm only happens when attacking, not blocking
[1:00:05] <munitalprats> your spiders hacve fearsome so just kill the threes
[1:00:06] <+Abd0022> noo
[1:00:06] <Learner621> use the spiderling
[1:00:08] <+disgruntledgruntle> Block iwth the 3/1
[1:00:09] <MyNameIsRasus> use the 3/1
[1:00:10] <Mundkipz> 3/1
[1:00:10] <laguerrilha> stop the 1/1
[1:00:10] <waterstealer> use spiderling
[1:00:11] <+goose_attack_almanac> use the small spider to block the 3 damage
[1:00:11] <GingaNZ> no
[1:00:13] <munitalprats> use the spiderline
[1:00:17] <munitalprats> you don't need to lblock
[1:00:18] <+temsik> use the expendable ones first!
[1:00:20] <munitalprats> but whatever
[1:00:21] <+patel347> keep elise alive
[1:00:24] <Mundkipz> save elise
[1:00:25] <MyNameIsRasus> block with spiderling
[1:00:25] <%notsoy> spiderling is expendable, use that to block the big guys
[1:00:28] <lazysaiyajin> dont let eat damage if its avoidable
[1:00:29] <waterstealer> use tiny spider
[1:00:30] <munitalprats> this is fine
[1:00:30] <iosephe> Only Overwhelm creatures can deal damage to the nexus when blocked
[1:00:34] <sparked963> Cant block means you cant position them. The enemy can though through Challanger or Vunerable and it will be a normal trade
[1:00:35] <+patel347> just take the 1/1 from the last breath guy
[1:00:39] <waterstealer> yes
[1:00:41] <+ProxyAskew> use your stuff with 1 health to block
[1:00:51] <munitalprats> Correct!
[1:00:53] <waterstealer> right
[1:00:54] <MyNameIsRasus> correct
[1:00:55] <Hirumm> let him learn too chat
[1:00:56] <+erro232> Use the eye on the left woolz
[1:01:00] <dds333a> Not everything has trample
[1:01:01] <munitalprats> that is absolutely the case!
[1:01:01] <GingaNZ> onlyyyyy overwelm
[1:01:05] <An_Armed_Bear> Overwhelm is a very valuable keyword for a reason
[1:01:07] <+disgruntledgruntle> This if fine rn tbh
[1:01:08] <munitalprats> yup!
[1:01:10] <Crombells> also, overwhelm doesn't trigger when blocking
[1:01:11] <+cha0tic_klutch> Blue eye on the left
[1:01:11] <Nikbottom> the LEARNING is real
[1:01:13] <MyNameIsRasus> exactly
[1:01:13] <dds333a> In the parlance I know LUL
[1:01:13] <munitalprats> that's one of the strenghts of spiders honestly
[1:01:16] <+BDazl> This game looks kinda cool
[1:01:18] <waterstealer> god if everything is overwhelm the game would suck
[1:01:18] <+disgruntledgruntle> Use blue eye on left
[1:01:23] <MyNameIsRasus> this game is really cool
[1:01:31] <+Izendale> Game cool
[1:01:31] <waterstealer> NO
[1:01:31] <munitalprats> wait
[1:01:32] <+Zyquux> if you see the rocky effect on top of the card, then you know overwhelm will happen
[1:01:32] <+temsik> leave the 1 point attackers alone, not worth it
[1:01:33] <+patel347> save elise
[1:01:33] <Mundkipz> noooo keep elise
[1:01:34] <MyNameIsRasus> NO
[1:01:35] <munitalprats> save elise
[1:01:35] <+goose_attack_almanac> NO
[1:01:36] <+Izendale> Riot less sk
[1:01:37] <+patel347> and let darius block the 3
[1:01:37] <MyNameIsRasus> GOOD
[1:01:37] <+disgruntledgruntle> @WoolieVersus The blue eye on the left shows the result of combat
[1:01:37] <pennykettle_> yeah you want to use the smallest units to block the strongest dudes generally. make the elephant have to deal with a mouse
[1:01:38] <waterstealer> yes
[1:01:39] <An_Armed_Bear> Don't kill Keeper
[1:01:40] <waterstealer> good
[1:01:44] <sparked963> Swap Darius
[1:01:45] <munitalprats> let darius block the 3/2
[1:01:51] <pennykettle_> hover over blue eye next to your nexus
[1:01:52] <+cha0tic_klutch> Use the blue eyeball
[1:01:53] <waterstealer> good blocks
[1:01:55] <dds333a> @pennykettle_ those squirrels can take on Emrakul
[1:02:08] <pennykettle_> LUL
[1:02:08] <iosephe> oh that's a 4/2 now?
[1:02:14] <+patel347> use the blue eye to figure out what happens
[1:02:16] <MyNameIsRasus> this way you also prevent thresh from leveling up, whic is MAJOR
[1:02:20] <+patel347> that way you can swap as much as you want
[1:02:21] <waterstealer> heal with grasp
[1:02:21] <Kalcom> yeah blocking that was bad
[1:02:25] <+Zyquux> Time for full SMOrc
[1:02:25] <+patel347> until you get the best outcome
[1:02:27] <munitalprats> kill the 4/2 with grasp
[1:02:27] <+disgruntledgruntle> @WoolieVersus The blue eye on the left shows the result of combat
[1:02:27] <%nintega010> the dunk
[1:02:31] <sparked963> The blue eye bewteen Nexus shows outcome
[1:02:43] <+cha0tic_klutch> ^
[1:02:44] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:02:45] <macmens> brood awakaning will destroy him this tuen
[1:02:57] <Kalcom> always play spider
[1:02:58] <pennykettle_> that opens when theres combat or spells. its BASED
[1:02:59] <munitalprats> yeah the blue eye is really useful
[1:03:03] <munitalprats> Brood's good too
[1:03:05] <munitalprats> Grasp or brood
[1:03:07] <+Zyquux> the eye will help a lot during combat
[1:03:08] <waterstealer> that s a good one too
[1:03:08] <munitalprats> both are good choices
[1:03:16] <+temsik> brood
[1:03:22] <+disgruntledgruntle> prob brood awakening here
[1:03:33] <+Izendale> Brood Might be better to establish more of a board?
[1:03:40] <iosephe> only 6 units max
[1:03:43] <munitalprats> BOOMERANG BLADE WHAT
[1:03:44] <waterstealer> wtf

[1:04:11] <Crombells> have to check the history on the left since it autopassed
[1:04:11] <sparked963> the script on the left
[1:04:12] <+disgruntledgruntle> @WoolieVersus Thats the spell that mageseeker got them when it died
[1:04:13] <munitalprats> History on the left
[1:04:13] <Mundkipz> left side gold scroll

[1:04:31] <pennykettle_> the history is NOT very clear but its there
[1:04:32] <munitalprats> Never fuckin' lucky
[1:04:35] <+Zyquux> actually unlucky with that enemy pull
[1:04:45] <+Izendale> If only i can click on history
[1:04:47] <Crombells> can't zoom in the history
[1:04:47] <munitalprats> you can't really
[1:04:49] <waterstealer> you cant
[1:04:52] <dds333a> He top decked the good shit, apparently
[1:04:55] <MyNameIsRasus> sadly no
[1:04:57] <+Zyquux> can't click on the history for some reason
[1:05:01] <dds333a> Oh, wow
[1:05:10] <+disgruntledgruntle> @WoolieVersus Thats the spell that mageseeker got them when it died
[1:05:15] <pennykettle_> Its somehow less useful than hearthstone's history thing
[1:05:18] <+Zyquux> @dds333a not a top deck, it was generated by a card earlier
[1:05:18] <+goose_attack_almanac> I'd say don't bother attacking
[1:05:19] <lazysaiyajin> all out attack
[1:05:19] <munitalprats> Is the decimate just a regular decimate or is it darius
[1:05:20] <waterstealer> no
[1:05:22] <An_Armed_Bear> noo
[1:05:24] <OblivionSword1> no he's not
[1:05:26] <MyNameIsRasus> your spíders don't have challenger anymore btw
[1:05:27] <+AnIrishPapaya> all in baby
[1:05:27] <Crombells> it's not worth attacking at all, bad situation overall
[1:05:29] <+goose_attack_almanac> he has another darius in hand
[1:05:36] <+disgruntledgruntle> dont attack here
[1:05:37] <GingaNZ> all in
[1:05:37] <waterstealer> extra champs turn into spells in hand
[1:05:38] <dds333a> @zyquux oh, did not notice. thanks for clarifying
[1:05:47] <munitalprats> I think you're just on defense here personally
[1:05:48] <lazysaiyajin> you can wait for better cards tbh
[1:05:51] <GingaNZ> all in cause your hand is better
[1:05:58] <+disgruntledgruntle> wait to use grasp and wail next round
[1:06:05] <waterstealer> id pass
[1:06:08] <+superchronicc> is this a pc port, or is this streamed on bluestacks?
[1:06:08] <+Zyquux> @dds333a yeah it's not obvious if you don't know what the cards do lol
[1:06:08] <Deasmeister> Looking rough imo
[1:06:09] <+goose_attack_almanac> Right lcik that BTW
[1:06:16] <waterstealer> vanilla unit
[1:06:20] <waterstealer> his last card is a spell
[1:06:27] <+Zyquux> @superchronicc it's on PC and mobile with the same client
[1:06:27] <MyNameIsRasus> right click the fresh catch guy
[1:06:28] <Deasmeister> Beefy boys
[1:06:31] <An_Armed_Bear> enemy's basically out of cards
[1:06:32] <pacibuddy> yeah this deck is meant to be like, REALLY agressive late game is kind of a weakness
[1:06:33] <munitalprats> this deck is an aggr ofocused deck
[1:06:36] <munitalprats> It's very aggressive
[1:06:43] <munitalprats> It's not the easiest to run
[1:06:47] <waterstealer> FARRON LEZ GO
[1:06:49] <Johannen> Be aggresive...be be aggresive
[1:06:50] <Nikbottom> Big lad
[1:06:51] <+disgruntledgruntle> Late game bomb lesgo
[1:06:52] <An_Armed_Bear> THE BOY
[1:06:54] <MyNameIsRasus> FARRON LESS GO
[1:06:54] <munitalprats> ided play wail personally
[1:06:57] <munitalprats> but do what you will
[1:06:57] <GingaNZ> strangely you need to attack more
[1:07:11] <GingaNZ> gotta force trades
[1:07:14] <dds333a> That could help
[1:07:15] <+Izendale> Wail's 1 damage, right?
[1:07:21] <Safarihat> farron will end this
[1:07:27] <waterstealer> grasp the 4/2
[1:07:27] <munitalprats> Wail is 1 damage
[1:07:29] <+goose_attack_almanac> 1 to all enemies and 3 health back to your own
[1:07:30] <Crombells> yeah wail doesn't do much
[1:07:32] <munitalprats> Wail or grasp
[1:07:34] <munitalprats> are both fine
[1:07:42] <waterstealer> grasp the 4/2 bru
[1:07:43] <Johannen> Grasp will kill a unit
[1:07:52] <+disgruntledgruntle> Wait for combat before u use the spells
[1:07:52] <+goose_attack_almanac> Drain heals your nexus
[1:07:54] <Crombells> a big blocker seems better
[1:07:56] <munitalprats> grasp can kill the 4/2
[1:07:56] <+Zyquux> grasp the 4/2 will help
[1:08:08] <waterstealer> OH NO
[1:08:13] <+Zyquux> F
[1:08:16] <munitalprats> btw look at the eye
[1:08:18] <pennykettle_> now use the eye to help. fuck math
[1:08:24] <+disgruntledgruntle> Boomerang blade part 2
[1:08:25] <dds333a> they're coming now
[1:08:27] <MyNameIsRasus> eye will help here
[1:08:46] <munitalprats> fearsome
[1:08:51] <GingaNZ> maximise their deaths
[1:09:01] <+Izendale> You do have a second copy of daruis in your hand, if you're worried about darius death
[1:09:07] <waterstealer> the eye is very helpful
[1:09:07] <munitalprats> you have a second darius in hand
[1:09:12] <munitalprats> so keep that in mind
[1:09:13] <Johannen> ^
[1:09:19] <MyNameIsRasus> you have a second darius in hand
[1:09:28] <waterstealer> use 6/1 to block 5/4
[1:09:30] <+Izendale> (2nd darius is currently a different card)
[1:09:38] <Mundkipz> 5/4
[1:09:39] <+Zyquux> the decimatebin hand will turn back to Darius if he dies
[1:09:48] <Mundkipz> 6/2 block 5/4
[1:09:48] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:09:49] <+cha0tic_klutch> You have that eye forever not just tutorial
[1:09:53] <munitalprats> i think you should kill the 5/4 too
[1:09:55] <MyNameIsRasus> 6/1 on the big one
[1:09:56] <+disgruntledgruntle> Block Scuttlegeist
[1:09:58] <An_Armed_Bear> Doesn't matter if your board dies you have a game-winning bomb in hand
[1:09:58] <%AyotoCorp> Look at the guy with the broken heart
[1:10:00] <waterstealer> block 5/4 with 6/1
[1:10:02] <munitalprats> 6/1 on the scuttle personally
[1:10:02] <Crombells> 6/1 looking mighty disposable
[1:10:06] <lazysaiyajin> kill the 5/4
[1:10:07] <+nial_evol> just trade the 6/1
[1:10:07] <+probably_facetious> KILL THE 5/4 WITH 6/1
[1:10:09] <munitalprats> it's very disposable
[1:10:14] <MyNameIsRasus> NO, use the 6/1
[1:10:15] <+disgruntledgruntle> NOT THAT BLOCK
[1:10:16] <munitalprats> It doesn't have overwhelm
[1:10:18] <munitalprats> it just has fearsome
[1:10:22] <+Abd0022> Keep Darius
[1:10:27] <+s_xylocalsingles> LETS GO WOOLIE RUNETERRA STREAM
[1:10:37] <waterstealer> none of them have overwhelm
[1:10:38] <MyNameIsRasus> Use the guy down there
[1:10:41] <+Zyquux> this late in the game, spiders aren't worth trying to keep alive
[1:10:42] <munitalprats> C U B E
[1:10:45] <lazysaiyajin> no overwhelm
[1:10:50] <Johannen> POWER CUBE
[1:10:59] <munitalprats> ided personally do trades
[1:11:00] <Mundkipz> ya actually that's true... 6/1 block 5/4
[1:11:03] <munitalprats> because you're low on health
[1:11:03] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> only half the cube, only half the power
[1:11:08] <waterstealer> no
[1:11:10] <waterstealer> dont do that
[1:11:14] <waterstealer> what
[1:11:15] <munitalprats> if you're gonna keep one around
[1:11:16] <MyNameIsRasus> that 6 is gonna get blocked
[1:11:16] <+goose_attack_almanac> wha\
[1:11:16] <munitalprats> keep the 6/2
[1:11:16] <lazysaiyajin> you can keep a six with the initial blocks
[1:11:25] <GingaNZ> force it
[1:11:30] <+goose_attack_almanac> keep the 6/2 if the 6/1 is also just oging to die
[1:11:31] <waterstealer> block the 1/1 with the 6/2
[1:11:36] <+disgruntledgruntle> there we go
[1:11:37] <+AnIrishPapaya> Guys he's figuring it out
[1:11:38] <waterstealer> pfff
[1:11:40] <+Re_Volta> if you attacked with the 6/1 the next turn the 1/1 could block it
[1:11:41] <+Zyquux> because when you attack he can just block the 6/1 anyway
[1:11:41] <dds333a> If it dies, it dies
[1:11:41] <lazysaiyajin> 1/1 with 6/2
[1:11:41] <pacibuddy> while pat is a Cubot woolie remains a mere Cuborg
[1:11:49] <munitalprats> Glimpse Beyond
[1:11:52] <munitalprats> sacrifice a unit for 2 cards
[1:11:57] <MyNameIsRasus> he just killed a monster to draw 2
[1:12:01] <MyNameIsRasus> POT OF GREED
[1:12:04] <mrtanaka111> farron looking ood

[1:13:25] <mrtanaka111> you got this
[1:13:26] <waterstealer> what a pull
[1:13:28] <%nintega010> lol
[1:13:29] <+disgruntledgruntle> @WoolieVersus That spell came from the Mageseeker that died
[1:13:29] <+Zyquux> this AI has insane luck
[1:13:30] <%Exiliator> rip rip
[1:13:30] <waterstealer> NO
[1:13:33] <mrtanaka111> dont attack
[1:13:35] <MyNameIsRasus> KEEP IT FOR BLOCKING
[1:13:37] <+goose_attack_almanac> keep it tod efend
[1:13:39] <mrtanaka111> wait for a better turn
[1:13:40] <Crombells> he can't attack, so it's fine
[1:13:43] <+nial_evol> he's gonna block it with a 2 attack
[1:13:43] <munitalprats> you need blockers
[1:13:49] <waterstealer> play brood next round
[1:13:50] <dds333a> Okay, so THAT was a top deck, right LUL
[1:13:51] <Nikbottom> yes
[1:13:52] <pennykettle_> its time travel rules
[1:13:54] <%jepupu> They block AFTER you commit
[1:13:55] <Crombells> it's the result of the current board only
[1:13:55] <+disgruntledgruntle> Don't attack yet
[1:13:55] <sparked963> Yes
[1:13:57] <GingaNZ> current state
[1:14:01] <+Zyquux> correct, it's what will happen at the current state
[1:14:01] <waterstealer> dont attack
[1:14:01] <mrtanaka111> dont rush it
[1:14:04] <+PikeBot> The preview just show the outcome with the cards as they are
[1:14:10] <lazysaiyajin> you didnt attack yet so no blockers
[1:14:11] <An_Armed_Bear> He's pulling Conservators off his Warden's Preys, which are pulling godlike spells
[1:14:12] <Daxalog> It cant predict what the opponent will do
[1:14:12] <munitalprats> The way combat works is technically Defense Favored
[1:14:13] <An_Armed_Bear> Double luck
[1:14:17] <MyNameIsRasus> The preview won't tell you what your opponent will do, only what the current situation will end up if the doesn't do anything else
[1:14:18] <Johannen> Its not gonna tell you the future turns of oppenents like in Into the Breach Woolie)
[1:14:23] <waterstealer> play brood

[1:15:25] <%GinAndRoses> that will go down to 0 if you summon them spiders

[1:16:22] <Nekros4442> Grasp of the Undying is there
[1:16:24] <munitalprats> but grasp does look good
[1:16:24] <+HalloKeyori111> You can also use grasp, it will cancel the enemies attack with that card you kill
[1:16:25] <Aaronc123425> grasp fearsome for hp
[1:16:27] <%GinAndRoses> grasp would be good

[1:19:00] <munitalprats> be careful of your order woolie

[1:19:06] <93lobo> All attack with all units
[1:19:08] <+goose_attack_almanac> Put Darius last in the line thoug
[1:19:08] <+disgruntledgruntle> Have Darius Attack last to get the level up @WoolieVersus
[1:19:08] <Reveresao> Attack him don;t let him play anything @WoolieVersus
[1:19:09] <+Zyquux> Darius last so he levels
[1:19:09] <+Re_Volta> Darius should attack last in line
[1:19:13] <munitalprats> no
[1:19:13] <+Abd0022> Just SMOrc SMOrc SMOrc SMOrc
[1:19:14] <Reveresao> no
[1:19:15] <Kalcom> last!
[1:19:15] <waterstealer> no
[1:19:16] <Nekros4442> Do that after
[1:19:18] <+l3sovikk> No, then he'll play a card
[1:19:19] <%baronblank> attack first with guys or he can counter
[1:19:19] <%GinAndRoses> don't give the AI a chance to do anything
[1:19:19] <munitalprats> if you play a card, he can play a card
[1:19:19] <laguerrilha> do after
[1:19:19] <OblivionSword1> play darius last
[1:19:20] <Mundkipz> no... you can always do that after, don't let him cast
[1:19:21] <+PikeBot> If you cast those spells, they wil;l get a turn
[1:19:21] <+l3sovikk> jus attack
[1:19:21] <93lobo> No just attack
[1:19:21] <MyNameIsRasus> the spell is slow, he can react or summon cards later
[1:19:21] <An_Armed_Bear> Attack so he can't do anything
[1:19:22] <lazysaiyajin> after
[1:19:23] <Deasmeister> swing before he can do anything
[1:19:24] <waterstealer> if you do anything they play a blocker
[1:19:25] <+Re_Volta> that allows them to play blockers
[1:19:25] <+Zyquux> no, open attack so he can't respond with blockers
[1:19:27] <Drizzydre116> not worth it he'll play a blocker
[1:19:27] <+HalloKeyori111> slow cards give the enemy time to play their own cards
[1:19:28] <Nekros4442> If you play a card that means the opponent gets to play a card
[1:19:30] <+UnfilteredComic> Have Darius hit last
[1:19:31] <pacibuddy> guys chill AI doesnt have fucking ruination
[1:19:32] <+l3sovikk> Put Darius last

[1:19:36] <+disgruntledgruntle> Have Darius hit last in limne
[1:19:36] <waterstealer> darius last
[1:19:36] <Aganok_> sttwck
[1:19:42] <pennykettle_> if you play a slow spell he gets his turn which means he could play his own slow spell after which might wipe your board, or he can play units to block
[1:19:46] <MyNameIsRasus> darius last so he levels up before doing damage
[1:19:47] <+disgruntledgruntle> PERFECT
[1:19:50] <pennykettle_> Hell yeah
[1:19:51] <+Zyquux> YEP
[1:19:51] <93lobo> Great

[1:20:06] <93lobo> Yep
[1:20:06] <waterstealer> no he will
[1:20:06] <reonome> yes
[1:20:07] <%GinAndRoses> right
[1:20:07] <munitalprats> he WILL but he wont have the damage
[1:20:08] <GingaNZ> exactly
[1:20:10] <An_Armed_Bear> He will, but he won't get the damage
[1:20:12] <pennykettle_> he will level up but he wont deal the extra damage
[1:20:12] <reonome> ORDER MATTER
[1:20:12] <lazysaiyajin> he will but will already have dealth damage
[1:20:13] <fatcrab_kurl> He will
[1:20:13] <+UnfilteredComic> He WILL level up
[1:20:13] <dds333a> order mattera
[1:20:14] <munitalprats> he wont have the damage boost
[1:20:15] <%jepupu> Just attack will all
[1:20:16] <Daxalog> Hell get the level up but wont be effective
[1:20:16] <Crombells> he'll get the level, but only after he attacks
[1:20:16] <Mundkipz> he will level up, but won't get damage boost
[1:20:17] <Aganok_> he will
[1:20:17] <+Abd0022> Level up but no level up damage @WoolieVersus
[1:20:18] <MyNameIsRasus> He'll level up, but he'll have attacked already
[1:20:18] <munitalprats> Look at his level up
[1:20:18] <macmens> hell level up but already attacked
[1:20:18] <%notsoy> he will level up AFTER he attacked
[1:20:18] <+disgruntledgruntle> He'll level up, but he won't seing for full damage @WoolieVersus
[1:20:19] <Johannen> He will level but you would miss out on the damage
[1:20:20] <+Zyquux> he will but you'll miss 4 damage
[1:20:20] <+PikeBot> He will level up, but AFTER he does his damage
[1:20:20] <Nikbottom> Combat happens in order not all at once
[1:20:21] <+AnIrishPapaya> He will level up
[1:20:21] <dds333a> *matters
[1:20:23] <Nekros4442> he wont get the damage boost if he attacks before the nexus is under 10
[1:20:24] <%GinAndRoses> he'll get the level but it will be after his damage is applied
[1:20:25] <+disgruntledgruntle> swing
[1:20:25] <Deasmeister> He will but after he attacks
[1:20:26] <OblivionSword1> he'll levell up but he won't get the level up damage
[1:20:28] <munitalprats> he gets +4 attack on level up
[1:20:32] <waterstealer> attack with geist
[1:20:32] <pennykettle_> he would do more damage after he levels
[1:20:33] <%TomoeMoeGozen> he'll get the level but not the extra damage
[1:20:34] <fatcrab_kurl> i thought it would do full damage but i havent played in a while
[1:20:35] <adelym0> he levels after the first two swing
[1:20:35] <An_Armed_Bear> Remember everything doesn't attack at once
[1:20:37] <+l3sovikk> He will, but put him third or last so he can see he can do more damage
[1:20:43] <Daxalog> You want him to level up before he attacks for higher stats

[1:22:52] <Kalcom> you can make a better deck with him
[1:22:54] <+crisdamighty68> do the trials to undrstand the mechanics
[1:22:56] <Daxalog> Nero was busted on release
[1:22:57] <%hologram_sam> the struggle
[1:22:59] <waterstealer> NO
[1:23:05] <macmens> you keep the cards
[1:23:06] <pennykettle_> playing an old meta deck like a 70 year old wearing their old fashion
[1:23:06] <munitalprats> it doesn't delete the cards
[1:23:09] <+Re_Volta> you can make new ones with the cards lol
[1:23:10] <waterstealer> i mean you can make a new one
[1:23:10] <MyNameIsRasus> you keep the cards
[1:23:11] <munitalprats> it just deletes the card selection
[1:23:11] <Nekros4442> you keep the cards Woolz
[1:23:11] <Nikbottom> Just the list
[1:23:12] <+AnIrishPapaya> keep the cards. its just a preset

[1:23:14] <pennykettle_> keep cards, deletes the assembled deck
[1:23:15] <waterstealer> you keep the cards
[1:23:16] <93lobo> The cards are still in library
[1:23:16] <+HalloKeyori111> I use the champs I find most attractive. That just makes sense.
[1:23:18] <lazysaiyajin> it deletes the loadout
[1:23:20] <+Zyquux> you keep the cards, you just free up a deck slot
[1:23:21] <Nekros4442> Just to make things cleaner
[1:23:24] <macmens> you can only have like 12 decks
[1:23:28] <%hologram_sam> The Gathering
[1:23:32] <+disgruntledgruntle> Try scouts @WoolieVersus

[1:25:37] <+Zyquux> the cards tab has all your cards lol
[1:25:40] <pennykettle_> the dots under the cards on the right are how many you have in the current deck. up to 3
[1:25:53] <waterstealer> youd think so
[1:25:54] <MyNameIsRasus> it does
[1:25:57] <waterstealer> but shes not that good
[1:25:57] <dds333a> Bounce man Kappa
[1:25:58] <+Re_Volta> Bladetwirler is the best part of stun decks
[1:26:01] <An_Armed_Bear> I remember when I thought that
[1:26:14] <Aganok_> Yasuo's deck is pretty fun
[1:26:21] <lazysaiyajin> still adorable
[1:26:24] <pennykettle_> im not a furry guys
[1:26:24] <+HalloKeyori111> Good lore
[1:26:24] <dds333a> Ouch
[1:26:25] <laguerrilha> is that an yordle?
[1:26:27] <waterstealer> yordle
[1:26:29] <+Zyquux> still cute
[1:26:30] <+disgruntledgruntle> @WoolieVersus You just removed a copy of it
[1:26:33] <munitalprats> I think it's a Yordle
[1:26:34] <mrtanaka111> shes a whatever fetish
[1:26:35] <OblivionSword1> that is a yordle
[1:26:37] <MessyBristles> bladetwirler is amazing
[1:26:39] <gyrobasel> its a furry tordle
[1:26:40] <%GinAndRoses> you took a card out of the deck
[1:26:44] <gyrobasel> yordle*
[1:26:44] <waterstealer> oh shit i never noticed the three tails
[1:26:45] <GingaNZ> plaugeofgripes

[1:26:50] <munitalprats> click the number
[1:26:51] <Crombells> whoops

[1:26:59] <+patel347> click the number to add one
[1:27:04] <+Zyquux> click on the number to add cards
[1:27:11] <restingbones> Anything that has those proportions is a yordle, they vary a lot on charecter specifics, but they all have the same shape.
[1:27:15] <MyNameIsRasus> you can also search for her on the right and add her that way
[1:27:20] <+Zyquux> right click removes cards I think
[1:27:26] <lazysaiyajin> damnn
[1:27:27] <mrtanaka111> awful card
[1:27:32] <waterstealer> zoe card
[1:27:32] <munitalprats> It's not the best card
[1:27:34] <waterstealer> \trash
[1:27:38] <+Zyquux> or clicking on the card itself, can't remember
[1:27:38] <SilverFaustX> woolie pat is yelling at u
[1:27:43] <+coldsama> 5 mana slow 4 damage is baaad
[1:27:47] <+Abd0022> Woolie pat is flaming you
[1:27:48] <KeiganOfAstora> DUDE
[1:27:50] <waterstealer> fast and burst can be cast during combat
[1:28:00] <Mundkipz> slow are the same as sorcery cards in magic
[1:28:03] <KeiganOfAstora> @WoolieVersus Pat is coming to get you because you're playing Runeterra
[1:28:05] <+Zyquux> slow=can be played when no one is attacking or blocking
[1:28:05] <munitalprats> They're slow, they can't be cast in combat or in reaction to other spells
[1:28:06] <pelonsinvalle> you can't use it while attacking or defending
[1:28:06] <pennykettle_> Slow spells cant be used to respond, its like playing a unit. it passes the turn back to them after
[1:28:07] <GingaNZ> speed only
[1:28:10] <raveous> the nature of slow itself
[1:28:11] <dds333a> "CAN'T" respond?
[1:28:11] <Nikbottom> spells have 3 speeds
[1:28:12] <munitalprats> correct
[1:28:14] <MyNameIsRasus> yes
[1:28:14] <+Zyquux> correct
[1:28:14] <waterstealer> OOF
[1:28:15] <waterstealer> yes
[1:28:16] <NickolasZombie> Pat said hes gonna fuck you up lol
[1:28:18] <+disgruntledgruntle> 4 speeds
[1:28:25] <+disgruntledgruntle> Focus, burst, fast, adn slow
[1:28:26] <KeiganOfAstora> It's on
[1:28:30] <dds333a> Pat prowlin'
[1:28:35] <pennykettle_> focus speed? @disgruntledgruntle
[1:28:36] <+disgruntledgruntle> and
[1:28:40] <+disgruntledgruntle> Ye
[1:28:47] <+disgruntledgruntle> They have a pink icon
[1:28:54] <pennykettle_> OH yeah that
[1:28:58] <MyNameIsRasus> "adn" was suposed to be "and" LUL
[1:28:59] <+disgruntledgruntle> Like gems
[1:29:02] <+Zyquux> focus is burst, but can't be used in combat. think buffing units before combat
[1:29:04] <munitalprats> btw woolie, whenever you see the words 'Grant' it means the buff is permanent
[1:29:06] <pennykettle_> focus is dumb. focus is burst but picky
[1:29:13] <Nikbottom> twin Disciplines is so hot
[1:29:32] <dds333a> Pat's like "Come see me in Runeterra"
[1:30:01] <munitalprats> man i love zenith blade
[1:30:09] <+AnIrishPapaya> 64 palms!
[1:30:09] <+Zyquux> focus is good because you don't want them to get +2, Quick Attack, and Overwhelm for 3 mana in the middle of combat
[1:30:11] <Daxalog> No one wants to fight pats Deep deck. No one likes fighting deep decks
[1:30:13] <mr_sups> @WoolieVersus Pat is threatening to crush your shit once you get enough cards to make a non-starter deck.
[1:30:13] <waterstealer> concussive palm is super good
[1:30:15] <dds333a> Oh, I recognize that too, that's Leona's
[1:30:20] <laguerrilha> Seeing so many side characters makes me miss the old lore through the newspaper formats
[1:30:22] <mrtanaka111> cool design
[1:30:25] <munitalprats> correct
[1:30:27] <munitalprats> he stuns a guy
[1:30:28] <MyNameIsRasus> yes you can
[1:30:28] <GingaNZ> great spell
[1:30:29] <munitalprats> and if you recall him
[1:30:29] <waterstealer> it's a really good card
[1:30:32] <%madmanrambler> you can combo that one, or just use it as a 3/2 that stuns somebody
[1:30:33] <+Cerabret100> boy that first person card writing just never stops hitting me weird
[1:30:34] <munitalprats> you can stun again
[1:30:36] <%madmanrambler> great flexibility
[1:30:38] <+Zyquux> Pat plays Deep? I'm somehow not surprised
[1:30:44] <waterstealer> nope
[1:30:44] <Nikbottom> a spell that becomes a man that becomes a spell
[1:30:47] <munitalprats> his stats reset
[1:30:47] <waterstealer> the same card
[1:31:02] <%jolene_orenji> jolene_orenji subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months! Hey Woolz, I picked up strive as my first fighting game because of your lore series and I'm proud to say I've finally made it to the celestial floor. Thanks for getting me into fighting games, now time to Megafist God :)
[1:31:06] <munitalprats> LEONAAAA
[1:31:06] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:31:07] <waterstealer> its super good
[1:31:09] <MyNameIsRasus> it is indeed
[1:31:10] <munitalprats> Best girl
[1:31:15] <dds333a> Ah, there she is
[1:31:16] <+HalloKeyori111> My girl Leona
[1:31:19] <+coldsama> @cerabret100 it's weird but It really helps making cards description a lot less confusing compared to games like Magic
[1:31:25] <+Zyquux> I want Leona to step on me
[1:31:26] <dds333a> Wow look at all those levels
[1:31:32] <waterstealer> free stuns
[1:31:36] <munitalprats> stuns for everyone
[1:31:42] <+Abd0022> Sum Lesbian Stuns
[1:31:43] <+Colinatlarge> Look at the art
[1:31:44] <dds333a> Do Champs have different "level caps"?
[1:31:45] <+AnIrishPapaya> I'm enjoying this because I see a card that looks good, and then chat immediately is like throw it Away! hot trash. I can never build decks lol
[1:31:50] <waterstealer> it causes 2 stuns if leona's on the board
[1:31:53] <waterstealer> levelled
[1:31:59] <%madmanrambler> @dds333a all champs are just level 1 and level 2
[1:31:59] <+HalloKeyori111> So in the Moba, Leona is good at stuns.
[1:32:00] <+goose_attack_almanac> SUN LESBINA WOO
[1:32:01] <+Abd0022> @dds333a only 3 champs have a 3rd level
[1:32:03] <munitalprats> @dds333a Champions level up in their own way, and most can only level up once unles otherwise specified
[1:32:13] <%madmanrambler> oh yeah ascended ones
[1:32:15] <dds333a> Thanks guys
[1:32:17] <munitalprats> WOOLIE ITS SO GOOD
[1:32:19] <Crombells> it can recall enemies
[1:32:20] <waterstealer> and you can recall enemies
[1:32:23] <GingaNZ> enemy
[1:32:23] <MyNameIsRasus> recall any unit, including enemies
[1:32:24] <mrtanaka111> this deck is horribly built lol
[1:32:24] <%madmanrambler> you can do it in combat
[1:32:24] <munitalprats> IT WAS NERFED TO 5
[1:32:25] <+Zyquux> @anirishpapaya just use the search feature and add all cards with a specific keyword. that's a good starting point
[1:32:26] <+disgruntledgruntle> Tempo plays\
[1:32:29] <lazysaiyajin> on enemies
[1:32:29] <Kalcom> any unit
[1:32:29] <macmens> its the strongest card in the game
[1:32:29] <Drizzydre116> Can save units from spells
[1:32:30] <SomeAsianDood> Can recall enemies too
[1:32:33] <MyNameIsRasus> you can also use it mid combat
[1:32:35] <Kalcom> enemy units
[1:32:35] <+Zyquux> remember when it was 3?
[1:32:36] <Nikbottom> it can recal enemy champs too
[1:32:38] <Daxalog> And also its FAST
[1:32:39] <lazysaiyajin> yuriko
[1:32:39] <+Cerabret100> @coldsama I hard disagree, but thats definitely dependent on how each individual processes text i'd imagine
[1:32:45] <MyNameIsRasus> it was pretty broken at 3
[1:32:48] <+AnIrishPapaya> It used to be 3??? fuck that
[1:32:48] <Daxalog> Are you gonna read his lore?
[1:32:53] <SomeAsianDood> Remember when deny was 3 LUL
[1:32:57] <+HalloKeyori111> Is Yone in this game?
[1:32:58] <SomeAsianDood> Man beta was a fiesta
[1:33:05] <munitalprats> @HalloKeyori111 not in his league of legends design, but yes
[1:33:06] <+Zyquux> @woolieversus remember, recalling units resets any buffs in them, even if they were applied before they were played
[1:33:07] <SomeAsianDood> @HalloKeyori111 just as a follower, pre death
[1:33:08] <Nikbottom> @HalloKeyori111 not the champ version
[1:33:08] <%madmanrambler> @HalloKeyori111 its weird, yone pre-dying is but not the champ
[1:33:09] <%TomoeMoeGozen> yone is in the game but he looks very different
[1:33:12] <munitalprats> Rahvun is SO IMPORTANT
[1:33:14] <MyNameIsRasus> deny at 3 was fucking absolute bullshit
[1:33:19] <waterstealer> rahvun is super important
[1:33:23] <+AnIrishPapaya> What do you guys think of this game trying a Battlegrounds type mode? or would it not really work
[1:33:28] <+Zyquux> deny at 3 was some bullshit
[1:33:28] <restingbones> Daybreak decks NEED 3 Rahvuns.
[1:33:29] <+coldsama> @hallokeyori111 As his alive self yes, The Demon hunter self isn't in yet
[1:33:31] <waterstealer> his card lore is kinda disappointing
[1:33:34] <MyNameIsRasus> he killed his brother
[1:33:35] <%madmanrambler> lol
[1:33:35] <waterstealer> thats just one of his quotes
[1:33:38] <+disgruntledgruntle> @WoolieVersus Rahvun makes it so Daybreak triggers even if it's not the first card played each turn
[1:33:38] <Daxalog> Its his quote
[1:33:41] <+HalloKeyori111> Wait so was Yone in runeterra before LoL?
[1:33:45] <%madmanrambler> some give useful lore, some give weird yells
[1:33:45] <munitalprats> @HalloKeyori111 yup
[1:33:45] <MyNameIsRasus> yes
[1:33:46] <%TomoeMoeGozen> yep
[1:33:48] <+patel347> @HalloKeyori111 yeah
[1:34:12] <+Zyquux> Rahvun plus Leona is the win condition of this deck
[1:34:13] <MyNameIsRasus> he's super good
[1:34:17] <+patel347> last line
[1:34:18] <SomeAsianDood> They even hired the same va from lor to make sure that it was consistent @HalloKeyori111
[1:34:21] <+Abd0022> it's always day for us
[1:34:22] <waterstealer> its always day for us
[1:34:23] <Crombells> "It's always day for us"
[1:34:23] <munitalprats> "It's always day for us"
[1:34:23] <restingbones> So yeah, craft one
[1:34:24] <MyNameIsRasus> it's always day for us
[1:34:30] <OblivionSword1> it's always day for us
[1:34:32] <+disgruntledgruntle> @WoolieVersus It's always day
[1:34:41] <restingbones> Yes!
[1:34:42] <munitalprats> he does
[1:34:43] <waterstealer> yes!
[1:34:43] <Nikbottom> yup
[1:34:43] <%GinAndRoses> he does!
[1:34:44] <munitalprats> he does both
[1:34:45] <+disgruntledgruntle> It's not a great way to actualoly say what he does tbh
[1:34:47] <MyNameIsRasus> you're correct
[1:34:49] <munitalprats> He creates a daybreak card, and its always day
[1:34:49] <Nikbottom> its both
[1:34:50] <%madmanrambler> yeah there should be a space
[1:34:50] <+Abd0022> it's both
[1:34:51] <GingaNZ> two effects
[1:34:54] <restingbones> He does BOTH of those things
[1:34:54] <Crombells> it does, but the last line is an effect on its own
[1:34:55] <%madmanrambler> like a line break imo
[1:34:56] <waterstealer> both
[1:34:56] <+disgruntledgruntle> It's the last line that says that
[1:34:57] <munitalprats> there's a period
[1:35:00] <SomeAsianDood> He does both
[1:35:05] <MyNameIsRasus> it's the second part that says that, the "it's always day for us".
[1:35:10] <LoneFonte> last part is not flavour text
[1:35:11] <+patel347> they need to reword this card imo
[1:35:11] <bigshedman> Wait but then the bonus Daybreak card can no longer be the first card you play?
[1:35:14] <+Abd0022> nope
[1:35:15] <MyNameIsRasus> Two sentences.
[1:35:17] <munitalprats> It's not just flavor text, no.
[1:35:17] <Nikbottom> so goofy
[1:35:18] <waterstealer> thats an effet
[1:35:21] <+Zyquux> daybreak is a condition on you, not the card. you will see a sun icon in-game
[1:35:22] <restingbones> Cards dont have flavor texts
[1:35:23] <+Abd0022> no flavor texts on the cards
[1:35:23] <GingaNZ> it's badly worded haha
[1:35:25] <+coldsama> No, it means Daybreak all the time no matter what
[1:35:28] <+disgruntledgruntle> It really needs to be reworded
[1:35:28] <MyNameIsRasus> I always found that wording bad
[1:35:31] <Kalcom> "it's always day for us" is awful card effect
[1:35:33] <dds333a> That's the ability itself, it seems
[1:35:39] <%madmanrambler> it makes more sense when he's on the board, you'll see a big shiny thing coming off him and all your daybreak cards will be glowing
[1:35:41] <+Zyquux> (nobody explain nightfall yet)
[1:35:42] <Nikbottom> LUL
[1:35:44] <waterstealer> flavor text is only when you click the eye
[1:35:45] <munitalprats> correct
[1:35:45] <MyNameIsRasus> It's bad wording
[1:35:47] <Deasmeister> Not super clear
[1:35:48] <+Zyquux> yes
[1:35:49] <Spmoheavy123> super not clear lol
[1:35:51] <munitalprats> It IS unclear
[1:35:52] <%GinAndRoses> it's muddled
[1:35:54] <+Cerabret100> Oof thats a really bad one
[1:35:56] <MyNameIsRasus> It is unclear
[1:35:56] <Crombells> it's not very well explained, not understanding is understandable
[1:35:57] <restingbones> Yeah the description sucks, and you only understand when you see it in action
[1:35:57] <+HalloKeyori111> its not the best
[1:35:58] <laguerrilha> yeah its not clear
[1:35:59] <+disgruntledgruntle> It gives your daybreak cards Nightfall
[1:36:00] <OblivionSword1> yeah it's not super clear
[1:36:02] <+Abd0022> you'll get it when you play the deck and see the animations @WoolieVersus
[1:36:02] <waterstealer> its kinda unclear
[1:36:05] <+HalloKeyori111> in fact its really unclear
[1:36:07] <Daxalog> No other card has flavor text do they?
[1:36:08] <%madmanrambler> its not great, it makes more sense when he's on the board and there's some particle effects going on
[1:36:10] <+Re_Volta> its not clear but man is it cool
[1:36:12] <munitalprats> yone is yasuos brother
[1:36:15] <+Yubul> Yeah. Rahvun is particularly poorly worded
[1:36:15] <MyNameIsRasus> yone is yasuo's brother
[1:36:16] <waterstealer> his bro
[1:36:16] <+Zyquux> @disgruntledgruntle that'll just confuse him lol
[1:36:23] <rasamune> Remind's me of "Makto's Revenge never ends" from Eternal
[1:36:24] <+HalloKeyori111> Yone you look wierd :I
[1:36:25] <+AnIrishPapaya> that card looks cool
[1:36:26] <+disgruntledgruntle> @Zyquux I know lol
[1:36:27] <MyNameIsRasus> stun them next round
[1:36:28] <waterstealer> only on round start
[1:36:29] <93lobo> Yone is Yassuo's brother and looks totally different as a champ
[1:36:36] <MyNameIsRasus> and every round after that
[1:36:38] <Crombells> the infinite mindsplitter will keep stunning those enemies at the start of each round
[1:36:42] <+Zyquux> @daxalog correct, all flavor text is only when looking at the full art
[1:36:45] <+coldsama> Only love for Minah
[1:36:49] <munitalprats> minah do be kickin
[1:36:54] <+Yubul> Minah solid
[1:36:55] <MyNameIsRasus> oh she kickin'
[1:36:55] <+Zyquux> Minah plus Yasuo is fun
[1:37:02] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yay for kick girl
[1:37:05] <dds333a> back into it
[1:37:08] <Aaronc123425> true she saved my soul a couple time
[1:37:08] <munitalprats> gotta hit play
[1:37:11] <MyNameIsRasus> you're on collection
[1:37:13] <%madmanrambler> surprised they didn't make a shurima deck
[1:37:17] <GingaNZ> lots of quick attack and stun
[1:37:26] <munitalprats> Correct
[1:37:26] <mrtanaka111> no excuses
[1:37:26] <waterstealer> it does change
[1:37:28] <MyNameIsRasus> YUP
[1:37:29] <Kalcom> he's a lot better with noxus
[1:37:30] <munitalprats> YUP
[1:37:32] <Deasmeister> yup
[1:37:35] <%Exiliator> Yup
[1:37:35] <+Zyquux> yeah, that is awful UI
[1:37:36] <waterstealer> yeah its not great
[1:37:41] <restingbones> Yes, we have all had this experience
[1:37:41] <pennykettle_> devs do a little trolling
[1:37:43] <OblivionSword1> yeah we saw
[1:37:44] <+AnIrishPapaya> kleanYepYep
[1:37:45] <Crombells> ain't a bad hand
[1:37:46] <%GinAndRoses> it's pretty bad
[1:37:47] <munitalprats> a little trolling
[1:37:48] <MyNameIsRasus> devs do be trollin
[1:37:50] <%CaptainPileDriver> you mean DELETE RIGHT?
[1:37:52] <dds333a> Almost got tripped up LUL
[1:37:52] <+disgruntledgruntle> This is a good hand
[1:37:57] <%madmanrambler> thankfully it does ask to confirm you want to delete the deck, but yeah
[1:38:00] <+Zyquux> I think it makes you confirm that you want to delete at least
[1:38:00] <+HalloKeyori111> It makes the game more of a challange
[1:38:01] <+Re_Volta> get rid of concussive i think
[1:38:04] <mrtanaka111> no yasuo hand
[1:38:04] <waterstealer> i mean the decks can be rebuilt so its not that big a deal but yeah
[1:38:24] <+disgruntledgruntle> Start on soldier
[1:38:25] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:38:29] <munitalprats> look at the day effect
[1:38:29] <Crombells> ohh, daybreak is better
[1:38:31] <%madmanrambler> and there's the big clear daybreak indicator
[1:38:32] <+AnIrishPapaya> what a cute little water shark
[1:38:34] <munitalprats> It's got a sun because it shows you
[1:38:42] <+Zyquux> for a daybreak deck, you want a daybreak card of 1, 2, 3, and 4 cost (usually Leona) in the opening hand
[1:38:46] <dds333a> Nice turn one drops
[1:38:47] <munitalprats> attack
[1:38:54] <munitalprats> the buff is temporary
[1:38:55] <macmens> now slam that bitch
[1:38:56] <+chase959> that's the use the card zone of the screen
[1:38:56] <MyNameIsRasus> that's free
[1:38:57] <BlackermanZX> So hows woolie doin
[1:39:06] <+Zyquux> free trade
[1:39:07] <MyNameIsRasus> he's doing great
[1:39:09] <%madmanrambler> 'hey bud want to trade'
[1:39:10] <waterstealer> guy sounds like "i'm comin back"
[1:39:10] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> hecc
[1:39:13] <mrtanaka111> heck
[1:39:16] <Crombells> IT WAS A GOOD KILL
[1:39:18] <+coldsama> Daybreak is basically do damage for free or force opponent into a bad trade for 60% of them
[1:39:20] <MyNameIsRasus> give vs grant
[1:39:25] <munitalprats> Give=Temporary Buff Grant=Permanent Buff
[1:39:29] <mrtanaka111> use her on defense
[1:39:30] <Daxalog> Solari would TOTATLLY kill hobos
[1:39:34] <MyNameIsRasus> grant means it's permanent, give is temporary
[1:39:34] <mrtanaka111> but not now
[1:39:35] <+Zyquux> that's a nearly ideal opening hand for Daybreak
[1:39:38] <+HalloKeyori111> you block this round so it makes sense
[1:39:39] <waterstealer> bladetwirler
[1:39:53] <waterstealer> oh
[1:39:55] <waterstealer> well then
[1:39:59] <OblivionSword1> it's fine
[1:40:03] <+Zyquux> you want to play daybreak whenever possible to level Leona ASAP
[1:40:08] <%madmanrambler> you're good, take your time
[1:40:19] <%madmanrambler> can go back and read any cards that got played thankfully
[1:40:32] <munitalprats> Give=Temporary Buff Grant=Permanent Buff
[1:40:35] <Crombells> the block is free for shieldbearer
[1:40:40] <waterstealer> block pig
[1:40:44] <pennykettle_> when you zoom in, next to the bottom right eye, you can click a card icon to show their base stats
[1:40:47] <+Zyquux> I never though about it, but Shadow Isles can be overwhelming for new players with all the stuff they spam
[1:40:48] <+Re_Volta> noo
[1:40:50] <The_Evil_Banana> No
[1:40:51] <+disgruntledgruntle> Block pig with shieldbearer
[1:40:51] <dds333a> NO MERCT
[1:40:52] <Kalcom> they always say "this round"
[1:40:53] <Nikbottom> Free blocks all day
[1:40:54] <+disgruntledgruntle> no
[1:40:54] <waterstealer> HERETIC
[1:40:59] <MyNameIsRasus> if he's above 3/2 at turn end, he'll be at 3/2 when the effects pass
[1:41:00] <Crombells> it's fine
[1:41:03] <OblivionSword1> this is fine
[1:41:04] <+nial_evol> it's alright
[1:41:08] <lazysaiyajin> its fine
[1:41:08] <+HalloKeyori111> he dies anyways
[1:41:08] <+Abd0022> it's fine it'd die anyways
[1:41:09] <%madmanrambler> its not a terrible idea to block with the 2/1, thing's dying either way
[1:41:12] <SomeAsianDood> One guy LUL
[1:41:14] <%madmanrambler> might as well get the bigger trade
[1:41:17] <Nikbottom> BLADE NICE
[1:41:18] <Crombells> zenith looking good
[1:41:18] <Hirumm> how's woolie doing?
[1:41:24] <+disgruntledgruntle> Fine play with blade
[1:41:25] <+Zyquux> damn good draws for daybreak
[1:41:27] <%madmanrambler> of course you don't have to go for the big sunshine, but it is nice
[1:41:27] <munitalprats> blade is good
[1:41:28] <+Re_Volta> eh i guess the 2/1 didn't have much else use
[1:41:29] <Daxalog> Does Tryndamere still have the spell were he does his current ATK as nexus damage?
[1:41:37] <Safarihat> damn the daybreaktrain is rolling
[1:41:54] <munitalprats> @Daxalog I Don't think that was ever a thing when i played, but there's a noxus card that strikes with overwhelm if played on an overwhelm card
[1:41:56] <SomeAsianDood> @Daxalog ? Trynd never had that. Are you talking about atrocity as a Shadow Isles spell?
[1:41:59] <Dante_Namikaze1> is he playing against the person or computer?
[1:42:00] <pennykettle_> @Daxalog I think tyr's spell is burst spell that gives a unit 8/4
[1:42:02] <+Zyquux> if you can get daybreak going, it's one of the most satisfying ways to play
[1:42:07] <%madmanrambler> @Dante_Namikaze1 computer
[1:42:07] <MyNameIsRasus> @Daxalog not trynd, but atrocity exists
[1:42:19] <Daxalog> ah
[1:42:25] <mrtanaka111> big lore
[1:42:31] <+Son_Bruce> @woolieversus you should def have some matches with @patstaresat
[1:42:36] <BlackermanZX> big shield man
[1:42:39] <munitalprats> big shieldgirl
[1:42:41] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> raise your shield woolie
[1:42:41] <MyNameIsRasus> big shield lady
[1:42:44] <munitalprats> but not as big shield as leona
[1:42:47] <munitalprats> raise your shield
[1:42:48] <dds333a> Solari and Lunari, huh
[1:42:48] <+nial_evol> ai playing tempo
[1:42:53] <BlackermanZX> thats a lady? kolSLURP
[1:42:55] <+HalloKeyori111> GIRL with biiig shield
[1:42:59] <MyNameIsRasus> ai is bad
[1:43:00] <Mundkipz> overwhelm
[1:43:01] <munitalprats> ai is bad
[1:43:03] <SomeAsianDood> AI is bad
[1:43:03] <Qwerty0307> you have overwhelm
[1:43:04] <GingaNZ> overwhelmed
[1:43:05] <munitalprats> you have overwhelm too
[1:43:05] <%madmanrambler> so because you had overwhelm it would only block 1 out of the 4 damage
[1:43:06] <Crombells> because of overwhelm
[1:43:07] <Mundkipz> wants to keep the spider
[1:43:08] <+disgruntledgruntle> bladetwirler here
[1:43:08] <munitalprats> leona time!
[1:43:09] <+Yubul> Overwhelm would make it eat the damage anyway
[1:43:10] <+nial_evol> naw, AI spending HP to keep tempo
[1:43:11] <+froduck42> lunari > solari
[1:43:12] <Nikbottom> Leona is good girl
[1:43:12] <+Zyquux> AI is being nice to new players :)
[1:43:13] <Daxalog> Migh tbuff the spider
[1:43:13] <munitalprats> Leona levels
[1:43:15] <The_Evil_Banana> What the AI did was right chat
[1:43:17] <%madmanrambler> yeye stun em up
[1:43:17] <waterstealer> DO EET
[1:43:18] <restingbones> your guy has trample, so it wouldnt be worth the sacrifice
[1:43:19] <%therustystream> overwhelm would make it still take 3 damage to the face
[1:43:23] <MyNameIsRasus> she will level up
[1:43:25] <munitalprats> correct
[1:43:25] <waterstealer> yes
[1:43:27] <MyNameIsRasus> yes
[1:43:29] <+Re_Volta> definitely leona yeah
[1:43:31] <%madmanrambler> yep!
[1:43:32] <%GinAndRoses> and she'll level
[1:43:35] <%therustystream> and level up
[1:43:36] <pennykettle_> AngelThump
[1:43:37] <+Abd0022> yes look at the sun above it
[1:43:40] <Nikbottom> BURN LIKE IT
[1:43:42] <+Zyquux> yeyeye big armor lady
[1:43:47] <+AnIrishPapaya> Big effects
[1:43:50] <dds333a> Hammered
[1:43:51] <%madmanrambler> yeah they like to chat with you
[1:43:53] <waterstealer> VECTOR CANNON
[1:43:55] <rasamune> Big effects
[1:43:55] <%therustystream> BIG FANCY SUPER MOVE
[1:43:57] <munitalprats> ANYA, DROP THE HAMMER
[1:44:03] <+Yubul> LoR
[1:44:04] <+Zyquux> now we need rahvun top deck
[1:44:05] <OblivionSword1> fancy effects is happening
[1:44:05] <+Re_Volta> god i love leona lmao
[1:44:07] <pennykettle_> The base game champs have basic bitch animations, the one from the Shurima update are whole ass movies
[1:44:09] <+Abd0022> wait till you see the newest chamos @WoolieVersus
[1:44:09] <+disgruntledgruntle> ignore the ephermeral
[1:44:09] <+Yubul> has such good polish and effects
[1:44:10] <MyNameIsRasus> leona rules
[1:44:14] <%therustystream> Leona is really fun in league
[1:44:19] <BlackermanZX> that goddamn stun from her R kolTRIGGERED
[1:44:24] <Crombells> ain't worth blocking an ephemeral here
[1:44:26] <waterstealer> block the 2/1s
[1:44:27] <+nial_evol> this is why AI didn't block last round
[1:44:31] <MyNameIsRasus> nothing hits quite as hard as doing 8 second long CC on the enemy adc
[1:44:31] <munitalprats> remember the eye
[1:44:35] <restingbones> yeah the 2/1s
[1:44:37] <MyNameIsRasus> don't block the ephemeral
[1:44:37] <munitalprats> the ephemeral will die anyway
[1:44:38] <%GinAndRoses> don't block ephemeral
[1:44:39] <+disgruntledgruntle> Ignore ephemeral
[1:44:40] <munitalprats> Ided lbock the others
[1:44:42] <SomeAsianDood> I still think level ups hit their peak with the bilgewater patch. TF level up makes me cream every time
[1:44:47] <The_Evil_Banana> The ephemeral will die anyway
[1:44:49] <+Re_Volta> read the ephemeral effect yeah
[1:44:53] <+HalloKeyori111> blocking the ephermeral is kinda pointless since they die anyways
[1:44:58] <dds333a> @mynameisrasus Christ.
[1:44:58] <%madmanrambler> let him work it through guys, no big deal if he blocks it
[1:44:59] <munitalprats> the SPIDER has ephemeral
[1:45:02] <munitalprats> now the islander
[1:45:04] <munitalprats> not the islander
[1:45:08] <+Abd0022> he's not ephermal the card next to him is
[1:45:14] <+nial_evol> the 3/2 has ephemeral, don't block it
[1:45:16] <OblivionSword1> the 3/2 has ephemeral
[1:45:23] <restingbones> yeah but only by 1
[1:45:25] <+nial_evol> the 3 doesn't matter
[1:45:25] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:45:25] <waterstealer> use health as a resource
[1:45:28] <munitalprats> I mean yeah but you'd have the board advantage
[1:45:31] <The_Evil_Banana> Health is a resource
[1:45:31] <Crombells> you're at 19 health, so the damage to your champion is a bigger issue
[1:45:32] <munitalprats> helath is a resource, it's your choice
[1:45:33] <%MutedMimic> MutedMimic subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 2 month streak! sugoiGirugamesh
[1:45:34] <%madmanrambler> yeah no there is an argument for blocking the bigger creature
[1:45:34] <SomeAsianDood> health is a resource
[1:45:34] <pennykettle_> taking nexus health is okay because it helps your units stay
[1:45:35] <+Zyquux> but he would be down an extra card
[1:45:35] <+Re_Volta> worth considering but this spider is still small damage
[1:45:36] <Mundkipz> your hp is a resource
[1:45:36] <Deasmeister> but kill 3 cards instead of two
[1:45:37] <GingaNZ> HP is fine if it's no 0
[1:45:38] <MyNameIsRasus> health as a resource
[1:45:39] <93lobo> don't block it it's not worth, block one of the permenants
[1:45:39] <%therustystream> yeah but you don't get board advantage
[1:45:39] <dan_g_v> hey chat peoples, how is it going? Any opinions on the game so far?
[1:45:40] <+Abd0022> Health is a resource
[1:45:45] <Safarihat> the only health that matters is the last one
[1:45:47] <Dante_Namikaze1> !MOTIVATED
[1:45:47] <@Moobot> @Dante_Namikaze1 2280 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[1:45:50] <OblivionSword1> it's your playy
[1:45:55] <+AnIrishPapaya> less blockers for them next turn
[1:45:58] <munitalprats> correct
[1:45:59] <waterstealer> yes
[1:46:00] <GingaNZ> yes
[1:46:01] <MyNameIsRasus> exactly
[1:46:01] <%madmanrambler> also true!
[1:46:02] <+nial_evol> that's called board tempo
[1:46:02] <+Zyquux> correct
[1:46:03] <pennykettle_> absolutely
[1:46:03] <%GinAndRoses> yessir
[1:46:04] <%therustystream> blocking the units is better in the long term
[1:46:11] <SomeAsianDood> yup usually
[1:46:11] <+Seiryu99> 3 damage once or 2 damage twice
[1:46:11] <jojojingle7> take 1 point of damage to kill 3 cards this turn
[1:46:12] <+HalloKeyori111> All in all you only take 1 more damage and get 1 more kill in return
[1:46:12] <Nikbottom> nice one
[1:46:18] <raveous> right, sacrifice a bit of health for a stronger board presence
[1:46:19] <pennykettle_> @dan_g_v he's doing pretty good just starting. I think he would be a cardgame pro in an alternate universe
[1:46:25] <munitalprats> and now you just play a daybreak card next turn
[1:46:25] <dds333a> @dan_g_v as somebody who has very little idea what this is besides what helpful people in chat have told me, I think it's interesting
[1:46:27] <%therustystream> now you stun too on any daybreak
[1:46:29] <munitalprats> Daybreaks pretty simple to understand
[1:46:30] <%therustystream> so you can hit the face
[1:46:33] <Mundkipz> keeping your champs healthy helps prevent direct damage from killing them off
[1:46:35] <dan_g_v> that is good to hear :3
[1:46:46] <restingbones> Zeebles, nice
[1:46:50] <MyNameIsRasus> that's a play effect, as in, that happens when you play that card
[1:46:53] <Nikbottom> weasle fairies
[1:46:53] <GingaNZ> new card is perfect
[1:46:57] <+Re_Volta> i like sword on leona here
[1:46:58] <mrtanaka111> remeber fey
[1:47:00] <munitalprats> Zenith or zeebles
[1:47:01] <mrtanaka111> it adds value
[1:47:04] <GingaNZ> sneaky
[1:47:04] <munitalprats> both are okay
[1:47:06] <+Zyquux> no rahvun :(
[1:47:06] <%GinAndRoses> zeebles is pretty good
[1:47:07] <+AnIrishPapaya> woowwww
[1:47:08] <+nial_evol> play the small guys to have board presence
[1:47:10] <MyNameIsRasus> three stuns
[1:47:10] <%therustystream> the orange glow means it will also get leona's ability to proc
[1:47:11] <Crombells> yo Zeebles is amazing here
[1:47:12] <+AnIrishPapaya> thats a good card
[1:47:14] <%GinAndRoses> yep
[1:47:18] <%madmanrambler> that's a good time right now yeah
[1:47:23] <critiquequartz> Ya winning woolie?
[1:47:26] <dds333a> ooh, board shutdown
[1:47:28] <OblivionSword1> that's every enemy
[1:47:31] <pennykettle_> might even be better to pass to let them play something
[1:47:32] <Mundkipz> waaaait nooo
[1:47:35] <munitalprats> maybe you want to get fae twirler down eventually
[1:47:48] <+Zyquux> here's the mind games: do you pass to see if he plays another small unit and risk him passing too?
[1:47:49] <+HalloKeyori111> Now destroy them!
[1:47:50] <Mundkipz> you shoudl get the fae out ealier to get the stun benefits
[1:47:52] <%therustystream> I'd swing all 3
[1:47:54] <Crombells> can't kill any of your cards, good attacking yum yum
[1:47:57] <Nikbottom> swing away jonny
[1:47:57] <GingaNZ> all in
[1:47:59] <%therustystream> cause he can only block 1
[1:48:00] <The_Evil_Banana> Full Attack
[1:48:01] <munitalprats> ided attack with all tbh
[1:48:09] <munitalprats> the zeeb's has elusive
[1:48:09] <restingbones> Elusive
[1:48:21] <pennykettle_> You are lucky you missed the elusive meta
[1:48:22] <+Zyquux> he can't block the elusive so it's free 3 damage
[1:48:22] <GingaNZ> mad good
[1:48:23] <+nial_evol> brRrRrRr
[1:48:23] <Nikbottom> LUL
[1:48:24] <MyNameIsRasus> LUL
[1:48:24] <Majestic_Flof> brrrrr
[1:48:25] <%GinAndRoses> lmao
[1:48:25] <waterstealer> LUL
[1:48:25] <%madmanrambler> lolol
[1:48:29] <dds333a> Ehhhhhhh, it's fine LUL
[1:48:29] <OblivionSword1> LUL
[1:48:30] <+HalloKeyori111> There are worse noises in this game
[1:48:30] <%CaptainPileDriver> pffffbbbtt
[1:48:32] <+Zyquux> @pennykettle_ DON'T REMIND ME
[1:48:34] <Crombells> the card is balanced by being obnoxious to play
[1:48:37] <Dante_Namikaze1> LUL
[1:48:38] <keohtv> brRrRrRr
[1:48:42] <munitalprats> the block still happens
[1:48:45] <munitalprats> reminder of that woolie
[1:48:51] <%therustystream> the block technically still happens in that situation
[1:48:55] <+HalloKeyori111> Yeah the block still happens
[1:48:55] <Nikbottom> Yasuo's brother!
[1:48:56] <%therustystream> it prevented leona from directly attacking
[1:48:57] <Kalcom> still blocks
[1:48:57] <macmens> you want to stun kalista
[1:48:57] <+goose_attack_almanac> Yasuo's brother
[1:48:58] <munitalprats> unless the unit has overwhelm, the block sitll happens
[1:48:58] <+Re_Volta> when you remove a blocker with a fast spell it will still block
[1:48:59] <Majestic_Flof> Just about helping you learn
[1:49:00] <waterstealer> block still happens unless you have overwhelm
[1:49:01] <+nial_evol> hp only matters when it's 0
[1:49:06] <pennykettle_> LYL
[1:49:09] <restingbones> that was the optimal option for the AI though
[1:49:11] <macmens> no that was good
[1:49:11] <+Zyquux> honestly that was the best choice for it
[1:49:13] <GingaNZ> that was properly
[1:49:14] <+disgruntledgruntle> Bladetwirler then stun kalista
[1:49:16] <Crombells> zenith is nice since it stuns as well
[1:49:18] <+temsik> blade twirler
[1:49:21] <+HalloKeyori111> Its actually pronounced Yoné
[1:49:21] <trustiano> Yone :(
[1:49:22] <The_Maddness> Harsh. But true
[1:49:23] <%GinAndRoses> can play two zenith blades
[1:49:25] <munitalprats> Zenith stuns the kalista!
[1:49:27] <%therustystream> the daybreak will stun kallista too
[1:49:32] <munitalprats> buff leona!
[1:49:37] <The_Evil_Banana> Leona
[1:49:37] <waterstealer> LEONA
[1:49:38] <%therustystream> no don't
[1:49:38] <munitalprats> the shieldbearer already ahs overwhelm
[1:49:39] <+temsik> twirler first
[1:49:39] <MyNameIsRasus> leona
[1:49:39] <%therustystream> buff leona
[1:49:41] <munitalprats> Leona doesn't have overwhelm
[1:49:43] <Crombells> shieldbearer already has overwhelm
[1:49:44] <+Abd0022> Leona to give overwhelm
[1:49:44] <restingbones> Dont waste the Overwhelm woolz
[1:49:45] <%therustystream> that unit already has overwhelm
[1:49:45] <raveous> you want it for someone else to get the overwhelm effect
[1:49:46] <Nikbottom> Leona needs the overwhelm
[1:49:46] <emptyantics> Who’s Yone and why are people sad posting?
[1:49:54] <%GinAndRoses> leona could use that overwhelm
[1:49:55] <%therustystream> it also grants the keyword
[1:50:02] <+goose_attack_almanac> @emptyantics Yasuoi's brother. He is dead. But also now a spirit
[1:50:02] <+Re_Volta> adding overwhelm is very valuable
[1:50:02] <+Seiryu99> She will also stun
[1:50:04] <munitalprats> The kalista gets stunned anyway
[1:50:08] <munitalprats> look at the eye
[1:50:09] <+Zyquux> Ripped Leona Kreygasm
[1:50:10] <OblivionSword1> this is a good plan
[1:50:12] <SomeAsianDood> @emptyantics yasuo's dead bro killed by yasuo. Anime backstory
[1:50:13] <+AnIrishPapaya> she also gets overwhelm
[1:50:13] <Nikbottom> Yone, turn back!
[1:50:14] <MyNameIsRasus> kalista will get stunned
[1:50:15] <emptyantics> @goose_attack_almanac Ohh ok thanks
[1:50:27] <urkleturtle> spreading the overwhelm is almost always good
[1:50:27] <waterstealer> YASUO LEVELLED
[1:50:39] <munitalprats> you played a card
[1:50:41] <pennykettle_> They just played it
[1:50:42] <munitalprats> they get to play
[1:50:45] <+Zyquux> never pulling Yasuo PepeLaugh
[1:50:51] <Crombells> Yasuo gonna be real good, sure would be a shame if we never draw him
[1:50:52] <dds333a> Let God sort em out
[1:50:53] <MyNameIsRasus> you played a card, so they get to play a card
[1:50:55] <Deasmeister> yep
[1:50:55] <+goose_attack_almanac> @emptyantics The card in his hand is Yone before he died.
[1:50:56] <waterstealer> YES
[1:50:56] <munitalprats> he levels up in the deck
[1:50:57] <+Abd0022> some champs can
[1:50:57] <%GinAndRoses> yep
[1:50:58] <restingbones> yep
[1:51:00] <MyNameIsRasus> yes
[1:51:01] <Qwerty0307> yeah
[1:51:02] <munitalprats> Leona and Yasuo both level up in the deck
[1:51:03] <Nikbottom> you just need 5 stuns
[1:51:03] <qsirius> Yes. He will level up right as you play him.
[1:51:04] <OblivionSword1> some champion can
[1:51:04] <The_Evil_Banana> Yes, some champions can
[1:51:05] <Daxalog> Some characters can. Yes
[1:51:06] <SomeAsianDood> Yes certain cards can based off the level up condition
[1:51:06] <Crombells> Yasuo's condition doesn't need him to be on the board
[1:51:06] <%madmanrambler> yep! his level up just says 'you have stunned or recalled x times'
[1:51:07] <pennykettle_> Yes. A card will specify "I SEE X" if they have to be on the board
[1:51:08] <GingaNZ> he is fully leveled
[1:51:08] <dds333a> Woah, interesting
[1:51:09] <+HalloKeyori111> yes, only some champs need to be on the field, or on the hand
[1:51:15] <%GinAndRoses> only some have to actually "see" their conditions fulfilled
[1:51:15] <%madmanrambler> a lot of champs do that, same for leona
[1:51:16] <MyNameIsRasus> champions that can't do that have "i see you do x" in their condition
[1:51:16] <Mundkipz> says you, not while in play
[1:51:18] <waterstealer> some say "i've seen" and some level in deck
[1:51:19] <urkleturtle> depends on the champion. some need to be in play, some just need a condition met
[1:51:20] <+coldsama> as long as "I've seen" is not in the level up requirement it works
[1:51:22] <macmens> some champs depended on what you do others need to be on the board
[1:51:23] <Daxalog> It specifies whenever
[1:51:23] <The_Evil_Banana> No

[1:51:23] <%GinAndRoses> no
[1:51:24] <pennykettle_> no
[1:51:24] <Crombells> it depends on the champion
[1:51:24] <%therustystream> No
[1:51:25] <Qwerty0307> depends on the champion
[1:51:25] <+Hasmeister96> No
[1:51:26] <SomeAsianDood> no
[1:51:26] <+disgruntledgruntle> NO
[1:51:26] <+Abd0022> champions that can't do that have "i see you do x" in their condition
[1:51:26] <MessyBristles> no
[1:51:26] <+Re_Volta> nope
[1:51:27] <MyNameIsRasus> no
[1:51:27] <macmens> like half
[1:51:28] <qsirius> Not everyone. Leona does, though
[1:51:30] <waterstealer> ones that say
[1:51:30] <Drizzydre116> depends
[1:51:31] <munitalprats> unless the card says "I SEE YOU DO X" it can level in the deck
[1:51:31] <pennykettle_> some will say "I SEE you do x"
[1:51:31] <Daxalog> The card tells you
[1:51:31] <Nikbottom> some say they need to SEE it
[1:51:33] <MyNameIsRasus> depends on how it's worded
[1:51:33] <GeoGio3> The day is getting closer when we will see woolie play Lol
[1:51:34] <waterstealer> "i've seen
[1:51:35] <OblivionSword1> some can some has to be in play depends
[1:51:38] <waterstealer> need to be on the board
[1:51:38] <+Hasmeister96> You have to read the cards
[1:51:40] <restingbones> if the cards says "I see you do X" then they have to be on the battlefield.
[1:51:47] <%madmanrambler> some will say 'I've seen you' which means those champs need to be on the board and seeing the thing to level
[1:51:47] <+HalloKeyori111> Elise needs to be on the board with 3 spider for example
[1:51:48] <Mundkipz> there is a key word "You"
[1:51:51] <Nikbottom> look at Kalista
[1:51:52] <The_Evil_Banana> That's the leveled one
[1:51:53] <%madmanrambler> you can click back to his level 1 to see it
[1:51:54] <+fetrigon> I C U
[1:51:55] <munitalprats> look at Kalista
[1:51:56] <jojojingle7> look at there kalista
[1:51:57] <djbw200> @WoolieVersus read kalista
[1:52:00] <munitalprats> Kalista has a "I see you condition"
[1:52:02] <Crombells> he doesn't have it because he doesn't need to see it
[1:52:02] <pennykettle_> The card would say "I see you stun or recall 5 units" if he had to be on the board
[1:52:05] <The_Evil_Banana> Look at the enemy Kalista
[1:52:06] <jojojingle7> kalista has the text on it
[1:52:06] <%sirisvirus> If the card says I see you then it has to be in play
[1:52:07] <Mundkipz> YOU stun or recall a unit
[1:52:07] <waterstealer> under level up
[1:52:08] <emptyantics> Only if they have the I SEE YOU condition
[1:52:09] <munitalprats> enemy kalista
[1:52:11] <+goose_attack_almanac> Some. Garen needs to either attack or defend. Braum needs to take damage. Some champs can be on the field but only need to see you do somethign
[1:52:13] <+AnIrishPapaya> Read Kalista as an example
[1:52:21] <munitalprats> she has to be on board
[1:52:22] <The_Evil_Banana> So Kalista needs to be on the board to level up
[1:52:23] <munitalprats> she's on the board
[1:52:28] <MyNameIsRasus> she's on the board
[1:52:28] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1420054806341816326?s=19
[1:52:28] <munitalprats> she's just stunned
[1:52:29] <+Re_Volta> she''s still on board
[1:52:29] <+Abd0022> she's on board
[1:52:31] <Crombells> click the Kalista on the board
[1:52:31] <waterstealer> right click on her on the board
[1:52:32] <+AnIrishPapaya> she has to br on board where as Yasuda doesnt
[1:52:32] <%GinAndRoses> she's on the board just right click her there
[1:52:32] <Daxalog> Shes on the board
[1:52:32] <restingbones> She is on the board Woolie
[1:52:33] <Nikbottom> LUL
[1:52:33] <+disgruntledgruntle> Click on her card
[1:52:34] <jojojingle7> shes on board
[1:52:36] <+goose_attack_almanac> shes pn the board
[1:52:37] <+chase959> she's on the board click her there
[1:52:37] <OblivionSword1> she's on the board click her
[1:52:39] <pennykettle_> So Kalista has to be on the board while 3 allies die, and the counter resets if she dies
[1:52:39] <+Abd0022> it does
[1:52:40] <munitalprats> Seeing IS being in play
[1:52:40] <%sirisvirus> "I've seen" means it has to be in play
[1:52:42] <waterstealer> seeing is in play
[1:52:44] <qsirius> Seeing is in play
[1:52:44] <+goose_attack_almanac> Seeing is in play
[1:52:44] <pennykettle_> yes seeing is on the board
[1:52:45] <+Abd0022> Yep
[1:52:45] <jojojingle7> yes it
[1:52:45] <restingbones> yes
[1:52:46] <MyNameIsRasus> seeing means it's in play
[1:52:47] <+l3sovikk> Seeing is on the board
[1:52:47] <SomeAsianDood> Seeing is being in play
[1:52:48] <dds333a> seems like
[1:52:48] <Daxalog> Seeing is litterally them being on the field SEEING you do it\
[1:52:48] <OblivionSword1> seeing is being in pplay
[1:52:49] <GingaNZ> it is, you have it backwards
[1:52:51] <%madmanrambler> she is on the board, you can click there, and if she isn't on the board you can click the enemy's deck to see their cards
[1:52:52] <munitalprats> also like Darius
[1:52:52] <Nikbottom> yup
[1:52:58] <Crombells> seeing is while in play, Yasuo doesn't have an "I see" condition
[1:53:03] <Deasmeister> yes if that's not there it can be done at any time
[1:53:08] <MyNameIsRasus> yasuo doesn't have "i see", so he can level up in the deck
[1:53:09] <%GinAndRoses> he doesn't have to see
[1:53:10] <pennykettle_> He doesnt say I see
[1:53:10] <+Re_Volta> look at the wording
[1:53:12] <munitalprats> Because he doesn't need to "see" it happen
[1:53:13] <%Vigonept> he doesnt have seeing
[1:53:14] <+AnIrishPapaya> Yasuo doesn't have the "I SEE"
[1:53:14] <The_Evil_Banana> Because he doesn't have "I see"
[1:53:14] <Daxalog> Yasuo dosnt need to see.
[1:53:14] <+Seiryu99> Yasuo doesnt say "Ive seen enemies get stunned"
[1:53:16] <dds333a> I guess he doesn't need to
[1:53:17] <restingbones> Because it would be too hard to level otherwise
[1:53:17] <jojojingle7> yasuo doesnt need to see
[1:53:17] <OblivionSword1> Yasuo does not have the word see
[1:53:17] <Nikbottom> thats not what is card says
[1:53:18] <raveous> because it's not an "i see" effect
[1:53:18] <93lobo> cause his condition is to get stuns or recalls not to see
[1:53:18] <BlackermanZX> yas doesnt have the "I see"
[1:53:19] <waterstealer> the level up condition doesnt mention that he has to see it
[1:53:19] <The_Maddness> If it DOESNT say, "I see" then its any time
[1:53:19] <SomeAsianDood> Yasuo doesn't have the "I see" keywords
[1:53:19] <trustiano> Dosen't have the "I see"
[1:53:19] <+l3sovikk> Because that's his level up condition. You just need to stun things
[1:53:20] <Mr_Rakjo> Doesnt have to see
[1:53:20] <jojojingle7> its not on his card
[1:53:21] <MyNameIsRasus> read his level up condition again
[1:53:22] <The_Evil_Banana> Read it right there
[1:53:25] <Canadian_Suit> @woolieversus seeing is having requirements met before the card is played
[1:53:26] <+AnIrishPapaya> YES
[1:53:27] <Crombells> you got it
[1:53:28] <munitalprats> Correct
[1:53:28] <%GinAndRoses> righto
[1:53:28] <restingbones> Yes
[1:53:28] <waterstealer> CORRECT
[1:53:29] <MyNameIsRasus> EXACTLY
[1:53:29] <+Seiryu99> Yeah
[1:53:29] <Qwerty0307> yeah
[1:53:29] <munitalprats> Exactly
[1:53:29] <Mr_Rakjo> Yes
[1:53:30] <Mundkipz> "YOU " (as in woolie) stun or recall 5+units
[1:53:30] <+disgruntledgruntle> YES
[1:53:30] <Majestic_Flof> Yea
[1:53:30] <%sirisvirus> Because his card just says you have done it anytime in the game
[1:53:30] <+AnIrishPapaya> woo
[1:53:31] <raveous> yup
[1:53:31] <+Abd0022> Yep
[1:53:31] <pennykettle_> Yep!
[1:53:31] <+Hasmeister96> Yes
[1:53:31] <BlackermanZX> correct
[1:53:32] <Nikbottom> NICE
[1:53:32] <GingaNZ> yee
[1:53:33] <LoneFonte> there you go
[1:53:33] <+Re_Volta> correct
[1:53:33] <+Zyquux> "When you" vs "I see"
[1:53:34] <%sirisvirus> yep
[1:53:34] <jojojingle7> yes
[1:53:35] <The_Maddness> Yes!
[1:53:35] <GeoGio3> yeh
[1:53:36] <munitalprats> It's not a yasuo only thing
[1:53:38] <munitalprats> Leona also does it
[1:53:40] <+chase959> ezreal pumps out his level in deck as well
[1:53:44] <MyNameIsRasus> CORRECT
[1:53:46] <%madmanrambler> exactly
[1:53:47] <waterstealer> YES
[1:53:47] <dds333a> Ye
[1:53:47] <munitalprats> Leona also levels up in the deck
[1:53:48] <+Seiryu99> Ya
[1:53:48] <raveous> that's why you'll see him level up while still in your deck
[1:53:48] <pennykettle_> Correct
[1:53:49] <%madmanrambler> you've got it
[1:53:51] <Shad0wTag> !uptime
[1:53:51] <@Moobot> @Shad0wTag WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 4 minutes
[1:53:53] <waterstealer> LUL
[1:53:54] <%Vigonept> yeah
[1:54:01] <+disgruntledgruntle> Bladetwirler
[1:54:02] <dds333a> Is that the exception, tho?
[1:54:03] <+HalloKeyori111> You are figuring it out! Yes its not super clear but you'll get the hang o fit
[1:54:06] <+Re_Volta> fae!
[1:54:08] <user_naim> He hears and then he sees
[1:54:09] <Crombells> inspiring mentor to give the twirler something is nice
[1:54:11] <Nikbottom> woolieGLORY
[1:54:13] <The_Maddness> Every card games gotta mix it up
[1:54:13] <restingbones> Play some guys
[1:54:13] <FacetiousAF> just got in, how's he liking it?
[1:54:13] <pennykettle_> This game is complicated lol
[1:54:26] <+disgruntledgruntle> Bladetwirler here for Yone next round
[1:54:28] <waterstealer> hes figuring it out
[1:54:33] <OblivionSword1> yeah sure
[1:54:36] <+disgruntledgruntle> Oh im dumb
[1:54:36] <SomeAsianDood> When is fae coming to league PepeHands
[1:54:38] <+Katohearts> I unno lol is pretty complicated already
[1:54:40] <+disgruntledgruntle> this also works lol
[1:54:40] <The_Evil_Banana> Leona can also level up in your deck, she doesn't have the "I see" requirement. That's why you saw here show up when you played Daybreak cards in the early game.
[1:54:42] <+Katohearts> hoo hoo hoo
[1:54:48] <munitalprats> there's some easy blocks here
[1:54:50] <munitalprats> Reminder woolie
[1:54:56] <munitalprats> Kalista will level up if 3 enemies dies
[1:55:01] <munitalprats> or 3 of her allies rather
[1:55:08] <urkleturtle> seeing also doesn't carry over to other copies of the champion, so if kalista dies while being at 2/3 allies seen dying, the next one will be at 0/3 again
[1:55:12] <waterstealer> watch for the kalista level
[1:55:23] <+blooberryjules> blooberryjules subscribed with Prime. 
[1:55:25] <Crombells> might want to only block two
[1:55:25] <+BappoTheMighty> @woolieversus Any champs that have the words "I've seen" OR "Ive dealt/blocked damage" can only level up while in play.
[1:55:29] <MyNameIsRasus> he'll figure it ou
[1:55:33] <+Zyquux> Kalista PepeLaugh
[1:55:34] <munitalprats> use the eye
[1:55:42] <+Re_Volta> he'll learn
[1:55:44] <MyNameIsRasus> remember eye, eye is friend
[1:55:45] <munitalprats> it genuinely helps
[1:55:46] <macmens> don't be afraid to take damage here to avoid Kalista level up
[1:55:47] <waterstealer> no
[1:55:48] <munitalprats> eye is big friend
[1:55:48] <Majestic_Flof> brrrr
[1:55:49] <93lobo> other way
[1:55:50] <mrtanaka111> fae this round, into yone next
[1:55:50] <+nial_evol> swap 1 and 3
[1:55:51] <restingbones> nope
[1:55:51] <The_Evil_Banana> Kalista is gonna level up lol
[1:55:55] <munitalprats> switch them
[1:55:55] <Mundkipz> nooo swap the 2/1 and 3/3
[1:55:57] <waterstealer> swap 1 and 3
[1:55:58] <munitalprats> Zeeble and 2/1
[1:55:58] <93lobo> swap last two
[1:55:59] <restingbones> you can do better
[1:56:04] <munitalprats> switch them and 2/3 dies
[1:56:06] <pennykettle_> Kalista level up here isnt a huge deal because next round is his attack round
[1:56:07] <OblivionSword1> this is fine
[1:56:08] <+temsik> eh, let it happen
[1:56:10] <+Zyquux> HERE IT COMES
[1:56:13] <munitalprats> this is ALSO fine
[1:56:15] <+temsik> he'll learn
[1:56:16] <munitalprats> it's just up to you
[1:56:24] <waterstealer> yes
[1:56:25] <MyNameIsRasus> this is optimal
[1:56:26] <Majestic_Flof> Nice
[1:56:28] <restingbones> Much better
[1:56:28] <BlackermanZX> great
[1:56:33] <+HalloKeyori111> Good
[1:56:36] <%CaptainPileDriver> bblblblblblblblb says the cards
[1:56:36] <+Zyquux> NO SNITCHES
[1:56:47] <Qwerty0307> YEP
[1:56:52] <%madmanrambler> the eye is such a nice feature
[1:56:57] <%madmanrambler> so useful to make you follow along
[1:56:57] <SomeAsianDood> Woolie will figure it out
[1:57:00] <Nikbottom> BRrdrdrdrd
[1:57:00] <dds333a> Zeebs gonna zeeb
[1:57:03] <Daxalog> I like how you can just tell that someone trying to roll an R or something
[1:57:05] <munitalprats> here comes kalista level up though lytSHOOK
[1:57:07] <+disgruntledgruntle> They always have glimpse Sadge
[1:57:07] <+Zyquux> more card games need the eye tbh
[1:57:12] <dds333a> woah
[1:57:17] <FacetiousAF> a WWFIO about his experience with card games sounds alright
[1:57:18] <Crombells> Kalista has a weird card text
[1:57:20] <restingbones> Woolie figured it out
[1:57:26] <waterstealer> kalista is confusing
[1:57:36] <munitalprats> REVIVE
[1:57:36] <MyNameIsRasus> oh you haven't even seen the cool ones yet
[1:57:40] <waterstealer> revive
[1:57:42] <dds333a> oh, spirit copies
[1:57:44] <+disgruntledgruntle> Bladetwirler before round end
[1:57:52] <+HalloKeyori111> I really want woolie to play against a proper full asencion deck with the 3 hour cutscenes
[1:57:55] <munitalprats> play blade twirler btw
[1:58:00] <pennykettle_> shes a lot harder to kill in level 2
[1:58:01] <urkleturtle> they are indeed very pretty and you can tell how new a card is by just how pretty that level up animation is
[1:58:07] <Mundkipz> you can read lore
[1:58:07] <Crombells> but only when she's attacking
[1:58:16] <munitalprats> you would need to kill the summon with a spell
[1:58:17] <+Re_Volta> yeah
[1:58:21] <+Zyquux> only when attacking!
[1:58:21] <+temsik> i mean.. if he draws a yasuo it wont matter
[1:58:24] <MyNameIsRasus> @HalloKeyori111 when he gets to pvp someone better do it to him
[1:58:25] <pennykettle_> only when she attacks. she dies defending
[1:58:38] <mrtanaka111> ghost rider
[1:58:39] <Deasmeister> Ghost rider
[1:58:42] <waterstealer> LUL
[1:58:42] <munitalprats> Ghost Rider
[1:58:44] <dds333a> where's her motorcycle
[1:58:44] <FacetiousAF> hell biker
[1:58:47] <Mr_Rakjo> Ghost Rider
[1:58:48] <+Zyquux> this goes back into that thing where sometimes you don't want to defend
[1:58:48] <93lobo> she dropped her shield
[1:58:50] <pennykettle_> 4Head
[1:58:50] <%madmanrambler> she lobs that shit at people, the spears inside her
[1:58:51] <waterstealer> SHOULDA DODGED
[1:58:51] <mrtanaka111> helltaker
[1:58:51] <BlackermanZX> she blocked with her chest
[1:58:52] <+UnfilteredComic> Undynd
[1:58:52] <waterstealer> OH WAIT
[1:58:53] <Crombells> she blocked it with her spine
[1:58:54] <gunstars20> Oh cool we got more Woolie and card games
[1:58:54] <%CaptainPileDriver> why block when you can just get stabbed and get a free spear out of it
[1:58:55] <MyNameIsRasus> DOOOOOOODGE
[1:58:55] <Safarihat> stabbed in the back
[1:58:55] <munitalprats> she blocked it with her chest
[1:58:58] <+HalloKeyori111> Notice how the spear in her is stuck through her back woolie?
[1:58:59] <LoneFonte> gottem
[1:58:59] <GingaNZ> just 6p it bro
[1:59:01] <pennykettle_> you got her
[1:59:01] <Nikbottom> it was a mix-up, hit in the back
[1:59:04] <SomeAsianDood> That's her own spear btw. Stabbed in the chest by another league character
[1:59:07] <+UnfilteredComic> Crossup
[1:59:08] <%TomoeMoeGozen> in league those spears are what she attacks with and they lodge in enemies the same as her and she can rip them out for more damage
[1:59:10] <%CaptainPileDriver> she get's a free weapon
[1:59:12] <plsnolookatme> Fun fact: While Kalista is in the Shadow Isles region, she's not part of the Ruination, she's a spirit hence why she's blue rather than the green of the ruination
[1:59:16] <+disgruntledgruntle> Yone next turn is great
[1:59:16] <MyNameIsRasus> Bring her in, it'll combo good with yone
[1:59:27] <+coldsama> she blocked so good the Ruination started because she deflected an arrow
[1:59:29] <munitalprats> palm
[1:59:29] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:59:29] <+Zyquux> watch this game end before drawing yasuo
[1:59:31] <emptyantics> @plsnolookatme Nice detail
[1:59:32] <+disgruntledgruntle> Yone the kallista
[1:59:33] <munitalprats> personally
[1:59:33] <waterstealer> kinda karen-ish tbh
[1:59:34] <munitalprats> or yone
[1:59:37] <munitalprats> yone's also good
[1:59:38] <Nikbottom> yeaaaaah
[1:59:39] <dds333a> Oh, Kalista got got by one of her own :(
[1:59:39] <+Zyquux> still no yas KEKW
[1:59:41] <MyNameIsRasus> yeah
[1:59:41] <restingbones> I guess Woolie was fooled by the fluffy tails
[1:59:45] <pelonsinvalle> good yone
[1:59:47] <BlackermanZX> Yone kolUuRAaAMESsSHI
[1:59:48] <pennykettle_> shes not attacking
[1:59:48] <munitalprats> the summon is only when Kalista ATTACKS
[1:59:49] <MyNameIsRasus> she can't summon
[1:59:50] <mrtanaka111> she summon on ttack
[1:59:51] <waterstealer> she only summons when she attacks
[1:59:52] <%madmanrambler> but she can't summon if she doesn't attack
[1:59:54] <mrtanaka111> not defense
[1:59:54] <+Abd0022> she doesn't summon in defense
[1:59:54] <MyNameIsRasus> she's on the defense
[1:59:55] <Crombells> Kalista doesn't get her summon unless she's the attacker
[1:59:56] <+HalloKeyori111> she cant summon if she is stunned
[2:00:01] <+disgruntledgruntle> @WoolieVersus She only summons when attacking
[2:00:02] <macmens> he dies super hard
[2:00:05] <OblivionSword1> YASUO WHERE YOU AT
[2:00:07] <The_Maddness> Yasuo: Nah
[2:00:08] <gunstars20> YASUO SwiftRage
[2:00:14] <munitalprats> Yone is yasuos brother
[2:00:16] <+Zyquux> Yasuo? ModCheck
[2:00:17] <pennykettle_> Theres a difference between striking and attacking. all attacks are strikes but not all strikes are attacks. so no summon when defending
[2:00:18] <Moonblade92> is Woolie seriously playing Yasuo? my man tormenting himself
[2:00:23] <emptyantics> YASUO KomodoHype
[2:00:27] <MyNameIsRasus> he's yasuo's brother
[2:00:30] <restingbones> Kalista only summons when she attacks
[2:00:32] <keohtv> it's yasuo'd brooother!
[2:00:32] <waterstealer> YASUOOOO
[2:00:34] <MessyBristles> man feels bad that yone caame out in lol soon after this came out and they looked nothing alike
[2:00:37] <waterstealer> COME OUT AND PLAYAY
[2:00:39] <+BappoTheMighty> Another helpful tip @woolieversus Ending your turn with mana is extremely helpful for playing higher cost spells.
[2:00:39] <plsnolookatme> Yone: IT SMELL LIKE BITCH IN HERE
[2:00:44] <+Abd0022> Spells don't have big splashes
[2:00:44] <pennykettle_> High Shivers
[2:00:45] <BlackermanZX> he wants that smoke
[2:00:46] <+disgruntledgruntle> full swing
[2:00:50] <MyNameIsRasus> GIVE ME THAT RUNBACK BROTHER
[2:00:52] <+HalloKeyori111> I cant get over alive yone

[2:01:05] <munitalprats> Keep her alive
[2:01:09] <waterstealer> he used fading memories check the history
[2:01:10] <restingbones> Big charge time
[2:01:12] <Moonblade92> @messybristles I feel ya, I wanted this handsome man and I got a Bleach cosplayer

[2:01:25] <+Re_Volta> kill kill kill
[2:01:26] <%GinAndRoses> big number time
[2:01:27] <+HalloKeyori111> btw woolie when you attack you can "sweep" up all the cards at once if you want to go all in
[2:01:28] <pelonsinvalle> edgy yone is so much worse
[2:01:33] <pennykettle_> all out is fine, its pressure they cant defend against
[2:01:34] <keohtv> brRrRrRr!
[2:01:36] <Qwerty0307> GG
[2:01:38] <MyNameIsRasus> you win
[2:01:39] <%madmanrambler> these friggin zeebs are killing me
[2:01:43] <pennykettle_> EZ Clap
[2:01:44] <Crombells> sure is a nice Yasuo deck
[2:01:51] <+Abd0022> now Yasuo LULW
[2:01:51] <dds333a> alrighty
[2:01:52] <Crombells> I really liked Yasuo there
[2:01:55] <+HalloKeyori111> brrbrbrrbrr
[2:01:57] <%TomoeMoeGozen> SURE LOVED THAT YASUO DECK WITHOUT THE YASUOP
[2:01:59] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yasuo never arrived, f
[2:02:00] <+Zyquux> nice Yasuo lol
[2:02:01] <munitalprats> Yasuo's deck is bad when yasuo isnt on the board
[2:02:06] <user_naim> In this behemoth typhoon... goldlewis sends you to the fucking shadow realm
[2:02:08] <Safarihat> yasuo did work that game
[2:02:08] <Daxalog> Your not really playing a character deck. Its more by faction
[2:02:08] <restingbones> Yasuo didnt even see play xD
[2:02:10] <+ikantreeed> My guuuuuy
[2:02:15] <+charm_quark_> I really like the braum big poro big numbers deck
[2:02:17] <dds333a> appearing is enough Kappa
[2:02:20] <waterstealer> the main problem with yasuo decks is not being able to draw him
[2:02:23] <munitalprats> HEY you can play players now!
[2:02:24] <%TomoeMoeGozen> can't believe yasuo carried you
[2:02:27] <Kalcom> he needs a searcher
[2:02:27] <munitalprats> time to fight all the netdeckers :^)
[2:02:27] <+HalloKeyori111> "Yeah but woolie have you seen (insert character that I like)?"
[2:02:28] <zk_nails> nap hype
[2:02:29] <pelonsinvalle> time to crush some newbs

[2:02:30] <%TomoeMoeGozen> yasuo is feed
[2:02:31] <pennykettle_> ok now to stream snipe Kappa
[2:02:31] <Nikbottom> WE DID IT
[2:02:32] <+nial_evol> time for time limits
[2:02:34] <+Zyquux> just like in LoL, Yasuo was afk
[2:02:36] <%townzzzzz> is it time?
[2:02:38] <mrtanaka111> the main problem with yasuo ekc is that youre playing a yasuo deck
[2:02:41] <macmens> yeah Yas decks carry him super hard
[2:02:42] <+Masked_Hero_Lucky> Yasuo feeding, as usual
[2:02:43] <%madmanrambler> honestly no shame for playing some more vs ai
[2:02:46] <BlackermanZX> yasuo didnt do shit like in the og game
[2:02:46] <%sirisvirus> @WoolieVersus Are you gonna try the labs?
[2:02:48] <Daxalog> DO IT
[2:02:49] <+coldsama> You should do challenges first, they act as tutorial for mechanics
[2:02:49] <@Solidus_113> yasuo is also voiced by Liam o brien
[2:02:50] <%madmanrambler> no need to rush in if you don't wanna
[2:02:52] <+Jasek7> unless it's teemo or shyv, then its a character deck
[2:02:52] <+Re_Volta> scouts might be fun next
[2:02:53] <Aaronc123425> 0/10 yasuo carry
[2:02:54] <GingaNZ> turn timers
[2:02:56] <%TomoeMoeGozen> The yasuo went 0/10/0 just like in league

[2:04:39] <%TomoeMoeGozen> nah you'll be fine
[2:04:41] <plsnolookatme> Woolie this game has some really poor UI, for example it doesn't even have an option to auto-mute players in the menu
[2:04:41] <Daxalog> Your probably fiightnig other defeaults
[2:04:42] <The_Evil_Banana> You won't

[2:05:40] <MessyBristles> yes yas
[2:05:40] <dds333a> Think, Woolie, Think
[2:05:43] <+sigmacake> attack
[2:05:44] <user_naim> the fairest fight i guess
[2:05:47] <The_Evil_Banana> Lmao Woolie
[2:05:48] <OblivionSword1> now we playing
[2:05:54] <GingaNZ> fae
[2:05:54] <+Zyquux> P A N I C
[2:05:58] <+Re_Volta> attacj! bite kill!
[2:05:59] <Safarihat> clock vs woolie who will win
[2:06:01] <mrtanaka111> whys is scales even on a yasuo deck
[2:06:03] <GingaNZ> paniccccccc
[2:06:13] <+disgruntledgruntle> pass
[2:06:14] <Crombells> not worth attacking that shit
[2:06:15] <+HalloKeyori111> Panic woolie, panic!
[2:06:16] <%townzzzzz> sacrifice yasuso for more time on the clock
[2:06:17] <+Re_Volta> nvm pass
[2:06:17] <+Abd0022> pass
[2:06:18] <KgKid51> think your fast? cute :)
[2:06:19] <+Zyquux> @mrtanaka111 just for the stun I assume
[2:06:19] <restingbones> welp, pass time I guess
[2:06:20] <MyNameIsRasus> pass
[2:06:21] <TheLordBeerus> @mrtanaka111 It's a default deck, it fits the theme
[2:06:28] <+fetrigon> time to panic
[2:06:31] <+fetrigon> KomodoHype
[2:06:31] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:06:35] <Moonblade92> @mrtanaka111 As usual the default decks are filled with vaguely thematic filler.
[2:06:39] <pennykettle_> theres a time bank system where if you end turn early you get extra time later turns
[2:06:44] <+patel347> nice you have twin deciples now though
[2:06:47] <GingaNZ> bank the mana
[2:06:49] <The_Evil_Banana> Pass
[2:06:49] <munitalprats> pass
[2:06:50] <+disgruntledgruntle> honestly jsut pass
[2:06:51] <+patel347> save the mana
[2:06:52] <+disgruntledgruntle> pass
[2:06:53] <Crombells> buff the twirler?
[2:06:54] <munitalprats> save the mana
[2:07:02] <%madmanrambler> scales also is nice
[2:07:05] <urkleturtle> playing a unit gives them the opportunity to play a blocker or slow spell so sometimes it makes sense to attack before doing anything else
[2:07:08] <%madmanrambler> lotsa options
[2:07:08] <Moonblade92> not actually even decent unless it's something like Lurk which only has a few cards you can put in a deck anyway
[2:07:13] <munitalprats> yup
[2:07:16] <MyNameIsRasus> correct
[2:07:17] <munitalprats> It's actually pretty important
[2:07:17] <+Zyquux> oh wait that's scales, I forgot that exists lol
[2:07:17] <emptyantics> @pennykettle_ Wait for real?! That’s great! I can’t think of any other tgc that does that
[2:07:18] <dds333a> Mando Hando
[2:07:19] <mrtanaka111> woolie,both decks can recall and stun, so dont prioritize buffs
[2:07:22] <@SoushinSen> is darklink888 a viewer?
[2:07:27] <MyNameIsRasus> oof
[2:07:29] <macmens> just take the damage
[2:07:32] <+disgruntledgruntle> just take it
[2:07:36] <MyNameIsRasus> just tank it man
[2:07:36] <GingaNZ> he's bad, you got this
[2:07:37] <munitalprats> take the damage personally
[2:07:39] <%madmanrambler> time to take 6! or you can do some magic trickery here
[2:07:39] <The_Evil_Banana> Just take it
[2:07:39] <+patel347> you can either take damage or sae 1 with twin
[2:07:40] <+Zyquux> @soushinsen KEKW
[2:07:41] <Safarihat> block with your face
[2:07:41] <Crombells> prolly not worth dealing with it
[2:07:48] <pennykettle_> @emptyantics I don't follow Hearthstone anymore, they may have added it. But I know they did here. Save up time for complicated turns :)
[2:07:55] <munitalprats> just pass honestly, the health goes down
[2:08:03] <+disgruntledgruntle> pass to next run
[2:08:05] <+disgruntledgruntle> turn
[2:08:13] <munitalprats> this is als ofine
[2:08:25] <Kalcom> that's a person
[2:08:27] <%madmanrambler> you got the cool yasu-bro
[2:08:29] <The_Evil_Banana> I would just attack here personally
[2:08:30] <@SoushinSen> @Zyquux ij just got here. is it a friend or viewer or jus ttotal stranger?
[2:08:32] <The_Evil_Banana> But I'm bad
[2:08:32] <+Abd0022> Yasuo
[2:08:33] <GingaNZ> yass queen
[2:08:34] <restingbones> Time to yas?
[2:08:34] <+disgruntledgruntle> play dat champ
[2:08:35] <+HalloKeyori111> now you can do big moves and beat your enemy into submission
[2:08:38] <pelonsinvalle> send the grimoire guy
[2:08:41] <Nikbottom> Sword boy hype!
[2:08:43] <+Zyquux> @soushinsen just a random presumably
[2:08:50] <urkleturtle> yasuo is a great attacker
[2:08:52] <Safarihat> its a rando
[2:08:53] <+patel347> you can use stun to buff fae
[2:08:55] <+Zyquux> @soushinsen first pvp game
[2:08:56] <Kalcom> yasuo all day
[2:08:56] <+fetrigon> @soushinsen rando
[2:08:59] <+disgruntledgruntle> Yasuo here
[2:09:00] <pennykettle_> its a random, i think its another new player
[2:09:01] <munitalprats> just for reference sake, if you saved the mana you could have played yasuo and still had mana to protect him with something like Twin Disciplines
[2:09:02] <LoneFonte> @Zyquux this is quick play, probably just a stranger
[2:09:03] <MyNameIsRasus> save zenith for yasuo
[2:09:10] <+Re_Volta> either the 1/3 or the 4/2
[2:09:19] <+Re_Volta> or yas
[2:09:23] <MyNameIsRasus> unless this guy has will
[2:09:27] <MyNameIsRasus> fuck
[2:09:28] <+Zyquux> @lonefonte can't count out a stream sniper
[2:09:33] <restingbones> welp
[2:09:38] <+xerotwo> oops
[2:09:40] <+disgruntledgruntle> It's fine we have a stun card for their attacking tune
[2:09:46] <MyNameIsRasus> not yet, he has part of the level up
[2:09:52] <+Abd0022> Pass
[2:09:54] <+Zyquux> Leona turn 4 gg
[2:10:09] <+Abd0022> Stun with 4 mana card
[2:10:10] <restingbones> Its fine guys
[2:10:19] <+BappoTheMighty> should have saved that mana brother. :/
[2:10:22] <+Hasmeister96> I would have attacked and then used concussive palm next round
[2:10:25] <KgKid51> no daybreak? lucky
[2:10:29] <MyNameIsRasus> stun is good
[2:10:34] <+Zyquux> first time, no Yasuo. 2nd time, no Leona. unlucky
[2:10:36] <restingbones> Zenith time?
[2:10:38] <+Abd0022> Stun
[2:10:41] <+UnfilteredComic> Palm a soldier
[2:10:41] <munitalprats> honestly i think you zenith yasuo here
[2:10:42] <Kalcom> stun time
[2:10:43] <GingaNZ> daybreak yass
[2:10:44] <MyNameIsRasus> your 4 mana stun is cool
[2:10:48] <urkleturtle> that would be alright
[2:10:49] <munitalprats> stun is also good
[2:10:50] <+patel347> you cant attack this round
[2:10:53] <+crisdamighty68> stun
[2:10:55] <restingbones> there, now nothing gets through him
[2:10:57] <pennykettle_> you can do the 2 mana spell and the slow spell if you do the burst one first
[2:11:04] <plsnolookatme> this is a good play]
[2:11:18] <The_Evil_Banana> That's a slow spell
[2:11:18] <+Abd0022> you have Twin Disciple
[2:11:19] <+BappoTheMighty> No, pass
[2:11:21] <+patel347> use deciples mid combat
[2:11:22] <pacibuddy> oh shit we players now?
[2:11:23] <munitalprats> pass
[2:11:27] <restingbones> Id keep the 2 mana for now
[2:11:28] <munitalprats> save mana for twin disciplines
[2:11:29] <+Zyquux> its better to save the burst for combat so you can choose your trade
[2:11:34] <Crombells> save mana for twin disciplines in case you need to deal with something suddenly
[2:11:40] <%madmanrambler> wonder how the opponent is gonna attack here
[2:11:40] <waterstealer> if it has a little blue outline it means you can cast it
[2:11:42] <%madmanrambler> not a ton of great options
[2:11:52] <waterstealer> wha
[2:11:53] <munitalprats> i don't agree with it, but its whatever, it's fne
[2:11:57] <restingbones> wasted on the chump blocker?
[2:12:01] <GingaNZ> dragon on 4/2 in future
[2:12:01] <Crombells> that's fine
[2:12:03] <waterstealer> i mean sure i guess
[2:12:07] <OblivionSword1> eh it's fine
[2:12:09] <urkleturtle> don't waste health buffs on low attack units
[2:12:15] <munitalprats> attack with yasuo
[2:12:20] <munitalprats> i think is the play
[2:12:21] <+Zyquux> probably the worst choice lol
[2:12:25] <MyNameIsRasus> attack with yasuo before he can stun him
[2:12:27] <restingbones> Woolie, it doesnt matter how much life you have as long as it doesnt reach 0
[2:12:30] <GingaNZ> stun 3/2
[2:12:43] <munitalprats> No he doesn't
[2:12:43] <urkleturtle> attack now so he can't daybreak
[2:12:44] <+patel347> stun a 3/2 to kill outright
[2:12:45] <Kalcom> attack first
[2:12:48] <munitalprats> He doesn't need to see the stuns happen
[2:12:59] <%madmanrambler> actually no! you just haven't stunned or recalled anything. thankfully he still is really good
[2:13:01] <Crombells> you don't need to be attacking
[2:13:03] <KgKid51> @restingbones it's not that simple depending on the deck though
[2:13:13] <%illtima> God, is every character in this game voiced by Liam O'brien?
[2:13:18] <zakbraff> zakbraff subscribed with Prime. 
[2:13:28] <+Masked_Hero_Lucky> No, just Yasuo
[2:13:29] <GingaNZ> now stun
[2:13:29] <+patel347> rememeber you can burst afterwards too
[2:13:32] <munitalprats> this is fine
[2:13:32] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:13:34] <munitalprats> now you STUN something
[2:13:35] <Crombells> stun is real good here
[2:13:35] <+Abd0022> Stun use the stun now
[2:13:36] <+Zyquux> @illtima I think it's just Yasuo, same as LoL
[2:13:37] <DeadManProp> So, apparently Pat has never played Pokemon Red and Blue...
[2:13:38] <+erro232> !uptime
[2:13:38] <BlackermanZX> Yas is voiced by Liam O'Brien
[2:13:38] <@Moobot> @erro232 WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 23 minutes
[2:13:41] <MyNameIsRasus> stun his mentor
[2:13:43] <munitalprats> stun the 2/1
[2:13:43] <urkleturtle> always wait on what your opponent does and react accordingly with your burst and fast spells
[2:13:44] <Kalcom> now stun
[2:13:45] <restingbones> @KgKid51 life is only a resource
[2:13:49] <+Hasmeister96> @illtima no, but I believe Koh the face stealer voices Nasus
[2:13:50] <%madmanrambler> it will come back to you
[2:13:58] <AstratesticoMan> I can't believe Wollie is a Yasuo main I'm litteraly shaking and crying right now
[2:13:59] <munitalprats> stun the 2/1 personally
[2:14:00] <plsnolookatme> Stun the blocker on Yasuo, Overwhelm will make him strike nexus
[2:14:02] <%madmanrambler> so whatcha want to cook up now my man
[2:14:03] <mrtanaka111> dont let fae die
[2:14:08] <+Re_Volta> stun leona or the 2/1
[2:14:11] <munitalprats> leona or the 2/1
[2:14:12] <GingaNZ> stun 2/1
[2:14:12] <restingbones> Stun the chump blocker
[2:14:13] <Crombells> the mentor would be best
[2:14:13] <munitalprats> are both good choices
[2:14:15] <+Zyquux> stun yasuo's blocker
[2:14:15] <The_Evil_Banana> Stun 2/1
[2:14:18] <waterstealer> no
[2:14:18] <+Abd0022> not this one
[2:14:21] <munitalprats> 2/1 means fae gets +2 attack
[2:14:21] <urkleturtle> yeah stun the 2/1, that kills it
[2:14:21] <+patel347> no kill the one in the back
[2:14:21] <MyNameIsRasus> not that one
[2:14:22] <restingbones> 2/1
[2:14:22] <+goose_attack_almanac> Stun the 2/5
[2:14:23] <+erro232> stun the 3/2
[2:14:23] <+Abd0022> leona or 2/1
[2:14:23] <93lobo> Leona
[2:14:24] <+erro232> defend fae
[2:14:25] <pennykettle_> I wouldnt stun the 2/1, I would Sunblessed VIgor the 4/2
[2:14:25] <OblivionSword1> whichever's fine
[2:14:26] <+patel347> fate gates stronger
[2:14:27] <waterstealer> good
[2:14:28] <MyNameIsRasus> good choice
[2:14:42] <+nial_evol> dope
[2:14:43] <+BappoTheMighty> Nice
[2:14:44] <MyNameIsRasus> great turn overal
[2:14:46] <93lobo> still good
[2:14:46] <%madmanrambler> they really did put a ton into those animations
[2:14:49] <The_Evil_Banana> Everyone saying stun the 3/2 LUL
[2:14:50] <+BappoTheMighty> good play.
[2:14:50] <GingaNZ> quick attack was great there
[2:14:51] <+nial_evol> huge advantage now
[2:14:54] <mrtanaka111> opponent mus hve a terrible hand
[2:14:57] <urkleturtle> safe that mana
[2:14:59] <waterstealer> pass
[2:14:59] <munitalprats> pass
[2:15:00] <Crombells> just save it?
[2:15:01] <munitalprats> save the mana
[2:15:02] <Drizzydre116> pass
[2:15:02] <+Abd0022> save mana
[2:15:03] <MyNameIsRasus> that's fine, save the mana
[2:15:03] <munitalprats> for next turn
[2:15:03] <+patel347> bank the mana
[2:15:06] <+Re_Volta> save mana
[2:15:13] <GingaNZ> bank
[2:15:14] <emptyantics> Save mana
[2:15:14] <restingbones> @pennykettle_ that would have meant bladewhirler died to the 3/2 though
[2:15:34] <Nikbottom> Death is like the wind
[2:15:34] <munitalprats> at the end of the round.
[2:15:35] <+Zyquux> free kill on the lifesteal guy lol
[2:15:35] <+patel347> end of round
[2:15:40] <pennykettle_> @restingbones after thinking, its probably better to save sunblessed, and also stunning helps Yasuo
[2:15:59] <%madmanrambler> 'uh oh my opponent just slid a 15 second movie in front of me'
[2:15:59] <mrtanaka111> not the darkness
[2:15:59] <munitalprats> he's near full health anyway
[2:16:01] <+patel347> leona leveled up
[2:16:08] <+Abd0022> give fae zenith
[2:16:08] <Nikbottom> Nine
[2:16:11] <+patel347> use burst and fast during combat
[2:16:12] <GingaNZ> tasty
[2:16:12] <+BappoTheMighty> 9*
[2:16:15] <munitalprats> give fae twirler zenith maybe
[2:16:17] <restingbones> @pennykettle_ exactly, gotta get those stuns going at some point
[2:16:30] <waterstealer> good choice
[2:16:31] <munitalprats> having quick attack AND overwhelm do be busted
[2:16:44] <pelonsinvalle> no
[2:16:46] <Crombells> best to save the burst spells for mid-combat intervention
[2:16:56] <restingbones> Thats fine
[2:16:56] <munitalprats> oh its fne
[2:16:59] <munitalprats> it just stuns yasuo
[2:16:59] <waterstealer> he cant cast it
[2:17:01] <+Zyquux> quick attack overwhelm Kreygasm

[2:17:03] <munitalprats> he can't play paddlestar
[2:17:05] <MyNameIsRasus> he doesn't have the mana to use the paddle star
[2:17:05] <munitalprats> not enough mana
[2:17:07] <waterstealer> he doesnt have enough mana
[2:17:12] <restingbones> he cant cast the follow up spell
[2:17:12] <+goose_attack_almanac> Costs 3 to use paddle star though

[2:17:29] <+goose_attack_almanac> summon teh tasty fae
[2:17:30] <mrtanaka111> you may want to heal

[2:18:06] <93lobo> No
[2:18:07] <waterstealer> NO
[2:18:08] <93lobo> no

[2:18:14] <GingaNZ> damn that was bad

[2:18:20] <93lobo> well it's fine he's learning
[2:18:25] <%madmanrambler> lol it really doesn't matter guys
[2:18:30] <93lobo> it'll give it some health i guess
[2:18:31] <+goose_attack_almanac> why does he want the 2/1 to live
[2:18:38] <restingbones> Burst spells are instants, use them to surprise your opponent at the last moment.
[2:18:39] <pelonsinvalle> chat is so funny
[2:18:39] <waterstealer> thats lethal
[2:18:40] <%madmanrambler> time for some blocks!
[2:18:40] <Dante_Namikaze1> yikes
[2:18:40] <BlackermanZX> body this kid woolz kolWESCI
[2:18:46] <urkleturtle> that was a reactive spell you kinda missed your chance to get your opponent with it
[2:18:51] <waterstealer> NO
[2:19:02] <munitalprats> this is why you hold the spell, you could have used it reactively
[2:19:05] <%madmanrambler> those are looking pretty good though
[2:19:07] <munitalprats> instead you've played the buff on the 2/1
[2:19:10] <%madmanrambler> nice blocks yeah
[2:19:10] <mrtanaka111> dont sacrifice twiler
[2:19:12] <Crombells> these are the right blocks
[2:19:12] <waterstealer> that works
[2:19:13] <GingaNZ> perfect
[2:19:17] <pennykettle_> thats good
[2:19:18] <MyNameIsRasus> that works great
[2:19:28] <pennykettle_> you usually just line up your attack with your opponents health. minmax
[2:19:29] <%madmanrambler> time to deploy a new buddy and set up the counter beatdown
[2:19:32] <MyNameIsRasus> play your tasty faefolk
[2:19:37] <munitalprats> don't heal the 2/2
[2:19:41] <munitalprats> he's not worth it
[2:19:44] <restingbones> Nooooo
[2:19:46] <+nial_evol> you can drop dudes on the field with excess mana
[2:19:49] <MyNameIsRasus> DON'T
[2:19:50] <Crombells> burst spells are best used for intervention when you really need it
[2:19:52] <The_Maddness> no
[2:19:52] <waterstealer> save burst spells for combat
[2:19:53] <munitalprats> just play a minion honestly
[2:19:56] <OblivionSword1> chat it's fine
[2:19:56] <restingbones> Woolie please, dont use burst spells unless you have to
[2:20:07] <MyNameIsRasus> burst spells are meant for combat woolz
[2:20:09] <waterstealer> OOF
[2:20:12] <munitalprats> use that on leona!
[2:20:15] <GingaNZ> sunburst leona
[2:20:18] <OblivionSword1> the enemy only has 2 cards anyway
[2:20:31] <mrtanaka111> woolie,dont use fast and burst spells proactvily, only use thena t last time possible to have advantage
[2:20:33] <munitalprats> use it on leona
[2:20:33] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1420054806341816326?s=19

[2:20:55] <%madmanrambler> it feels like you need to go faster then you do, promise
[2:21:08] <munitalprats> it's not that strong here
[2:21:09] <restingbones> its fine
[2:21:10] <MyNameIsRasus> not to you,
[2:21:10] <pennykettle_> I think "never use burst and fast proactive" isnt good advice but generally theyre good for catching them offguard in combat
[2:21:11] <BlackermanZX> he is fucked now
[2:21:27] <MyNameIsRasus> he is pretty fucked

[2:23:09] <+BDazl> Yoooo congrats on the win! GG!
[2:23:09] <%madmanrambler> its pretty unlikely
[2:23:10] <waterstealer> nah not really
[2:23:11] <+CrabStealer> Nah that was lost
[2:23:11] <+thedream_c> not with his card draw
[2:23:13] <Crombells> you were firmly ahead
[2:23:13] <Deasmeister> He was pretty ded
[2:23:13] <restingbones> Not with that deck he couldnt
[2:23:14] <%GinAndRoses> unlikely
[2:23:14] <waterstealer> he had like 2 cards
[2:23:16] <+Faultlined> I twould of been a lot of lucky draws
[2:23:17] <MyNameIsRasus> No cards, no mana?
[2:23:18] <The_Evil_Banana> He ran out of gas
[2:23:18] <pennykettle_> with some decks possibly
[2:23:19] <+nial_evol> his cards might've sucked
[2:23:21] <waterstealer> you had a way better board
[2:23:23] <MyNameIsRasus> No board?
[2:23:24] <GingaNZ> you had hand and board advantage
[2:23:25] <+AmericanSkidd> time to retire with 100% wr
[2:23:27] <@Solidus_113> we take those
[2:23:30] <munitalprats> you had a big board advantage and he was topdecking
[2:23:32] <+thedream_c> only had 1 card in hand and I don't think they had anything to fight 4 units on board
[2:23:33] <GingaNZ> never tap out
[2:23:34] <pelonsinvalle> shit hand probably
[2:23:36] <Daxalog> Yeah but thats Teppen
[2:23:37] <urkleturtle> nah, he was topdecking while you had a full grip and overwhelming board presence
[2:23:40] <user_naim> Woolie smells blood in the water
[2:23:41] <+Abd0022> depends on your hand @WoolieVersus
[2:23:42] <emptyantics> @americanskidd LUL LUL LUL
[2:23:45] <%madmanrambler> alright, time to retire with a winning record
[2:23:49] <KgKid51> ight time for ranked :)
[2:23:51] <munitalprats> next match gives you shiny
[2:23:53] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> next time we see Woolie he will be in top 50
[2:23:54] <BackwardCap> If they top decked kick girl
[2:23:54] <pennykettle_> region roads is the real unlock
[2:23:57] <pennykettle_> LUL
[2:24:01] <waterstealer> LUL
[2:24:03] <MyNameIsRasus> LESS GO 100% WR
[2:24:05] <restingbones> No, the screen will be shiny somewhere if you earned some cliky clicks

[2:24:06] <+vaderxyz1970> Undefeated
[2:24:07] <+gutlesscoward> literally unbeatable
[2:24:08] <Aaronc123425> he needed mina there
[2:24:09] <+thedream_c> 1 - 0 better than 0 - 2 in card games :)
[2:24:09] <GingaNZ> UNDEFEATED
[2:24:11] <+goose_attack_almanac> If you want to see a strong card that works well with Yasuo, look at Swiftfoot in the Ionia cards
[2:24:13] <%GinAndRoses> undefeated, runeterra god
[2:24:15] <CheyMix> 100% win rate woolie
[2:24:16] <+najaytheslug> HWATTTTT
[2:24:19] <+thedream_c> some decks you wanna pass often
[2:24:19] <+Zyquux> if you're down to top decking against 4 units on the field, it's pretty over
[2:24:19] <Deasmeister> 100% win record undefeated
[2:24:19] <munitalprats> Knowing when to pass is important
[2:24:21] <+thedream_c> like Karma/Ez
[2:24:23] <+najaytheslug> LOR ON WOOLIE VS
[2:24:27] <Crombells> you're doing good with the passes right now
[2:24:27] <waterstealer> thats the entire game
[2:24:32] <Nikbottom> Mindgamez
[2:24:36] <+thedream_c> or TF Swain
[2:24:36] <The_Evil_Banana> It should be the EXACT opposite thinking LUL
[2:24:37] <GingaNZ> it's hard as fuck
[2:24:40] <waterstealer> knowing when to pass is what separates the newbs from the masters
[2:24:41] <+AmericanSkidd> you learn that with experience
[2:24:41] <+najaytheslug> its a game of interacrtions
[2:24:48] <urkleturtle> priority is a THING in this game. even more than in magic, which is crazy
[2:24:49] <pennykettle_> treat your health as a big fat unit to protect the others
[2:24:54] <%madmanrambler> only got so many draws from your deck though, and you know you got that 20. Both are tough things to value
[2:24:55] <Daxalog> Do you have enough resources to start getting oyur own cards yet?
[2:25:01] <munitalprats> incoming pirate aggro
[2:25:09] <pelonsinvalle> time to netdeck
[2:25:10] <munitalprats> "we shall never forget our Adage"
[2:25:10] <+goose_attack_almanac> I kinda wanna see a wacky Gangplank deck
[2:25:11] <+thedream_c> yeah cuz in some turns yiou wanna see if you ropponent commits
[2:25:11] <The_Evil_Banana> Can't wait see a meta deck
[2:25:12] <%madmanrambler> I think they hold his hands a little longer until he gets to access that @Daxalog
[2:25:12] <MyNameIsRasus> Incoming shurima cinematic universe
[2:25:16] <Deasmeister> That was a mirror match deck wise so it was good
[2:25:20] <munitalprats> spiders deck!
[2:25:22] <+thedream_c> wacky gangplank? its just pirate aggro
[2:25:23] <restingbones> Aggro starter deck
[2:25:32] <+Abd0022> reroll
[2:25:37] <GingaNZ> swap mind
[2:25:37] <waterstealer> mulligan dragon
[2:25:38] <munitalprats> mulligan one of the leonas and the dragon
[2:25:39] <Demoli_PT> @WoolieVersus have you been following the olympics? which country you rootin for?
[2:25:40] <+Abd0022> Leona too
[2:25:41] <munitalprats> yeah
[2:25:42] <restingbones> yes maybe
[2:25:42] <munitalprats> that's good
[2:25:43] <pennykettle_> Infinite Mindsplitter is busted
[2:25:44] <MyNameIsRasus> I think prologue players only play prologue players
[2:25:48] <MyNameIsRasus> good mulligan
[2:25:50] <Nikbottom> good plays from this man
[2:25:50] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> galaxy giraffe waow
[2:25:51] <+thedream_c> wait is your opponent playing spider aggro?
[2:25:51] <waterstealer> he knows!
[2:25:54] <Crombells> yeah, Leona's spell isn't that great, no reason to have two
[2:25:54] <restingbones> nice
[2:25:55] <%madmanrambler> later horrifying eldritch dragon from beyond the stars, right now I'm looking for the silly old grandpa
[2:25:55] <The_Evil_Banana> I want Woolie to win enough games that he starts playing against meta decks. Now that'd be funny
[2:25:57] <+thedream_c> uh rush down time
[2:25:59] <GingaNZ> great hand
[2:26:01] <pennykettle_> @Demoli_PT do people root for countries other than their own
[2:26:01] <emptyantics> SPACE GURAFGE
[2:26:03] <+nial_evol> the combo here is nice
[2:26:03] <munitalprats> pass
[2:26:06] <urkleturtle> i always send back anything that costs more than 3
[2:26:06] <macmens> pass
[2:26:07] <munitalprats> or solari
[2:26:16] <restingbones> not yet
[2:26:17] <The_Evil_Banana> Pass
[2:26:18] <+thedream_c> zenith blade when your board gets developed
[2:26:22] <+thedream_c> and if you have rahvun
[2:26:26] <restingbones> knowing when to pass
[2:26:27] <KgKid51> no 1 cost with a aggro is rough already
[2:26:30] <MyNameIsRasus> he can play conspirator now and recall him
[2:26:30] <GingaNZ> solari to level leona
[2:26:31] <%GinAndRoses> recall him
[2:26:35] <+nial_evol> recall mentor next round
[2:26:36] <restingbones> conspiritor
[2:26:40] <%madmanrambler> ooh you can buff the elusive guy here
[2:26:44] <%madmanrambler> or leona that works too
[2:26:44] <pennykettle_> buffed but counts towards leona, if you had a turn 2 daybreak it mightve been a good play
[2:26:54] <+thedream_c> oh ok basic stuff
[2:26:59] <munitalprats> woof his hand must be rough
[2:26:59] <urkleturtle> attack buff would've been nice on the elusive unit
[2:27:09] <+thedream_c> odd turns your opponent may slap elise?
[2:27:18] <+Zyquux> no 1 drops in a Darius deck? oof
[2:27:25] <GingaNZ> recall time
[2:27:26] <Crombells> recalling your dude is good
[2:27:27] <+thedream_c> wait?
[2:27:27] <%madmanrambler> so next turn if your opponent plays a big card because you stocked that point you can palm it if you want to
[2:27:29] <Crombells> don't kill that
[2:27:30] <MyNameIsRasus> don't block that
[2:27:32] <waterstealer> IT'S SIGMA
[2:27:33] <restingbones> Woolie, a good tip about elusive units, generally you want to buff thier attack.
[2:27:33] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:27:34] <Daxalog> uh oh
[2:27:34] <Kalcom> don't block
[2:27:35] <captainmarvelous> Woolie built a deck with religious fanatics. The jokes write themselves.
[2:27:35] <+thedream_c> IMO just take it
[2:27:37] <munitalprats> you NEED to recall a unit to play him.
[2:27:37] <+AmericanSkidd> never attack that thing
[2:27:38] <+Zyquux> his hand must be abysmal lol
[2:27:39] <pennykettle_> oh yeah DONT block
[2:27:39] <+Abd0022> DO IT
[2:27:39] <GingaNZ> Do not block that
[2:27:42] <munitalprats> NEVER block that
[2:27:45] <Drizzydre116> Can't kill it
[2:27:47] <+thedream_c> so you are sorta on a clock
[2:27:49] <waterstealer> simga
[2:27:50] <MyNameIsRasus> never kill it
[2:27:54] <munitalprats> CORRECT
[2:27:54] <%madmanrambler> yeah he's gonna just try to kill it himself
[2:27:54] <waterstealer> it's just sigma
[2:27:54] <restingbones> Yes
[2:27:56] <+thedream_c> yes
[2:27:58] <Deasmeister> never kill it
[2:27:58] <%GinAndRoses> never kill him
[2:27:59] <+Abd0022> never kill it
[2:28:00] <Daxalog> Hes most likely going to kill it himself
[2:28:05] <waterstealer> OH THIS FUCKER
[2:28:08] <+thedream_c> zenit blade GRANTS so yeah good deal
[2:28:08] <pennykettle_> If you can stun that guy or recall him, do that
[2:28:09] <restingbones> Dont kill it unless you silnece it or you HAVE to
[2:28:11] <+goose_attack_almanac> no0 woolie
[2:28:12] <urkleturtle> recalling a 1 drop ain't bad. and it heals it in the process and give you another daybreak activation
[2:28:12] <The_Evil_Banana> It's the BM Emote
[2:28:12] <munitalprats> so unfortunately you drew both zenith blades
[2:28:13] <+thedream_c> GRANT is a perma buff
[2:28:13] <The_Evil_Banana> this guy
[2:28:17] <MyNameIsRasus> it's fine
[2:28:18] <+AmericanSkidd> its fine
[2:28:18] <waterstealer> dont block it
[2:28:26] <OblivionSword1> it's for leona it's fine
[2:28:27] <93lobo> Good enough
[2:28:28] <Daxalog> Its only BM if you know its bm
[2:28:35] <waterstealer> leona doesnt need to see
[2:28:35] <+thedream_c> true its only bm if u know
[2:28:37] <munitalprats> don't block it
[2:28:37] <The_Evil_Banana> Don't block it
[2:28:37] <MyNameIsRasus> don't block
[2:28:40] <restingbones> :)
[2:28:42] <+Zyquux> didnt emote back Sadge
[2:28:43] <%madmanrambler> oh are we gonna unlock the emote meta
[2:28:43] <+thedream_c> if u don't you be an ignorant one
[2:28:44] <urkleturtle> don't ever block that
[2:28:44] <pennykettle_> all the emotes in this are dank memes but league characters
[2:28:44] <waterstealer> dont block
[2:28:46] <+Abd0022> that emote is BM
[2:28:49] <ItsEzKill> its bm
[2:28:50] <+EinTheBusinessDeer> Woolie that Braum emote is BM
[2:28:53] <%madmanrambler> where we drop the dirty memes on our opponents before we even get to the game itself
[2:28:56] <+thedream_c> someoen made an emote tier list so I go by that
[2:29:01] <waterstealer> attack
[2:29:03] <munitalprats> sunburst
[2:29:06] <waterstealer> silence
[2:29:06] <munitalprats> or recall it
[2:29:07] <+thedream_c> cuz some emotes are def fire and worth the money ifyou like em enough
[2:29:07] <MyNameIsRasus> he can't block, just swing
[2:29:07] <+Zyquux> @pennykettle_ I personally like the Nocturne as the Kaiba meme
[2:29:09] <waterstealer> sunburst
[2:29:09] <restingbones> That emote is NOT BM unless it is spammed, or played before the killing blow
[2:29:16] <munitalprats> your answer in this deck for that card is sunburst
[2:29:17] <KgKid51> emotes are also mind games lol
[2:29:18] <Daxalog> Hell just destroy it himself most likely
[2:29:19] <pelonsinvalle> bm?
[2:29:21] <GingaNZ> pass then leona
[2:29:33] <+nial_evol> he couldn't block that anyways
[2:29:40] <+thedream_c> whose their 4 drop I wonder
[2:29:41] <+Abd0022> @restingbones it's always BM unless it's round start that's how i feel anyways
[2:29:43] <munitalprats> i would have considered passing but also who knows
[2:29:50] <+thedream_c> ooohh senry wom womp
[2:29:55] <waterstealer> spooder
[2:29:58] <OblivionSword1> stun
[2:29:58] <+thedream_c> thats a trade?
[2:30:01] <munitalprats> you would deal 1 damage
[2:30:03] <munitalprats> correct
[2:30:03] <waterstealer> does 1 overwhelm
[2:30:05] <pennykettle_> 1 PogChamp
[2:30:09] <%madmanrambler> tough to say if that's worth it all its own
[2:30:11] <+nial_evol> you spent a zenith on him
[2:30:11] <MyNameIsRasus> 1 DAMAGE LESS GO PogChamp
[2:30:12] <+thedream_c> sentry always likes to trade anyway
[2:30:15] <+nial_evol> that's 2 cards for 1
[2:30:18] <+thedream_c> BUT your dude was a 1 cost
[2:30:18] <waterstealer> he might take the damage
[2:30:19] <GingaNZ> hard to tell
[2:30:23] <Drizzydre116> good trade card
[2:30:28] <munitalprats> i think you just pass
[2:30:31] <waterstealer> good trade
[2:30:31] <munitalprats> but it's up to you
[2:30:32] <93lobo> get rid of spiders
[2:30:32] <munitalprats> it's hard to tell
[2:30:39] <93lobo> elise needs spiders to transform
[2:30:40] <urkleturtle> you lose a card in the process since your dude is worth 2 cards once you used your enchantment on it
[2:30:42] <MyNameIsRasus> look at this guy
[2:30:42] <+thedream_c> IMO net neutral
[2:30:49] <+AmericanSkidd> i would say the less chances for the enemy to get damage off is best
[2:30:51] <restingbones> @Abd0022 your feelings are wrong, Braum is wonderful and should not be used to BM others, he would not approve
[2:30:52] <GingaNZ> true
[2:30:54] <MyNameIsRasus> true
[2:30:56] <waterstealer> truth
[2:30:57] <Nikbottom> truth
[2:31:00] <MyNameIsRasus> biggest brain
[2:31:04] <OblivionSword1> net neutral is better than negative
[2:31:05] <munitalprats> READ THAT CARd
[2:31:07] <munitalprats> ITS IMPORTANT TO KNOW
[2:31:08] <+thedream_c> also you have enough anti0-aggro at this point
[2:31:09] <+thedream_c> LMAOOO
[2:31:09] <MyNameIsRasus> READ THAT
[2:31:12] <+AmericanSkidd> his hand is shit
[2:31:12] <waterstealer> oh god
[2:31:14] <+thedream_c> its fine they don't have enough combos to proc her hard
[2:31:18] <waterstealer> stun undying
[2:31:19] <BlackermanZX> oh god
[2:31:20] <+Zyquux> I forgot about their timer voice lines
[2:31:22] <waterstealer> then navori
[2:31:23] <GingaNZ> sneaky
[2:31:23] <Daxalog> Welcome to hell
[2:31:23] <+thedream_c> its not PNZ variant
[2:31:25] <munitalprats> stun undying
[2:31:25] <restingbones> zeeble time?
[2:31:30] <urkleturtle> that's something that gets stunned by zeebles
[2:31:32] <Aaronc123425> oh goodness
[2:31:32] <+thedream_c> PNZ variant can make the swing girl go off harder
[2:31:35] <waterstealer> that works
[2:31:51] <+thedream_c> good thinking on tradding vs elise
[2:31:55] <waterstealer> she never attacks here
[2:31:56] <GingaNZ> she won't go in
[2:32:00] <+Zyquux> I'm surprised he hasn't Glimpse'd the Undying yet
[2:32:05] <+EinTheBusinessDeer> trigger daybreak
[2:32:10] <munitalprats> daybreak imo
[2:32:10] <+thedream_c> i think they may not have glimpse
[2:32:10] <%madmanrambler> Yone is gonna be great next turn if the opponent gives you time
[2:32:11] <GingaNZ> zenith leona
[2:32:14] <+Abd0022> summon fae and navori
[2:32:14] <+EinTheBusinessDeer> leona is about to level
[2:32:17] <waterstealer> stun into navori
[2:32:17] <Crombells> zenith looking good
[2:32:23] <+Vampireinarm> zenith leona into concussive palm
[2:32:23] <MyNameIsRasus> zenith looking good
[2:32:26] <+thedream_c> or waiting to use glimpse against stun targets
[2:32:41] <MyNameIsRasus> does this deck run vengeance
[2:32:41] <waterstealer> he might vengeance
[2:32:42] <MyNameIsRasus> ?
[2:32:43] <munitalprats> you can stun mid combat
[2:32:47] <waterstealer> it does
[2:32:59] <pennykettle_> FeelsGoodMan
[2:33:00] <waterstealer> YEEEESSS
[2:33:00] <GingaNZ> you so smart
[2:33:01] <MyNameIsRasus> vengeance would suuuuck
[2:33:01] <%madmanrambler> yeah you can do that really nicely
[2:33:01] <+thedream_c> damn woolie is trying to hard value tail of the dragon too hard LMAO
[2:33:01] <+AmericanSkidd> good combo
[2:33:02] <Nikbottom> YEEES
[2:33:02] <mrtanaka111> hes learning
[2:33:03] <Jaysky> Conspiracy comes out?
[2:33:04] <%GinAndRoses> you got it
[2:33:10] <GingaNZ> huge brain
[2:33:11] <munitalprats> big conspiracy
[2:33:13] <+Zyquux> does the premade Darius/Elise deck have atrocity?
[2:33:13] <waterstealer> guy's thinking
[2:33:15] <Drizzydre116> and if you get zoe out before the recall he'll get stronger too
[2:33:16] <+thedream_c> but yeah its one of the short loops
[2:33:16] <+EinTheBusinessDeer> Watching Woolie's mindset in games like these is honestly so fun
[2:33:23] <waterstealer> i think as a one-off?
[2:33:27] <raveous> very much so
[2:33:27] <macmens> @Zyquux no
[2:33:32] <emptyantics> Woolie with the big plays
[2:33:33] <+thedream_c> 9 dmg on board so far
[2:33:34] <pelonsinvalle> it's league
[2:33:34] <MyNameIsRasus> oh yeah
[2:33:35] <munitalprats> HEROES NEVER DIE
[2:33:36] <%madmanrambler> oh hell yeah overwatch arguably took the quotable hero lines from league
[2:33:38] <pennykettle_> Oversaturated Hero games
[2:33:39] <waterstealer> TELL THE PEOPLE
[2:33:41] <Jaysky> Leona's lines are fun
[2:33:43] <+AmericanSkidd> leona be like praise the sun bitch
[2:33:46] <+Zyquux> @macmens dang, I want to see Woolie react to that
[2:33:46] <FassieFons> marketable T-shirt quotes
[2:33:49] <+thedream_c> this elise won't do her sopider stuff until u swing maybe
[2:33:49] <Jaysky> WHAT YOU HAVE SEEN TODAY
[2:33:51] <munitalprats> easy attack here
[2:33:51] <Crombells> that's a stun
[2:33:54] <munitalprats> attack

[2:34:32] <+Vampireinarm> stun = cant block
[2:34:32] <pennykettle_> great attack turn
[2:34:33] <+CrabStealer> Nah it's still good
[2:34:35] <BlackermanZX> its fine

[2:34:38] <waterstealer> DONT ATTACK WITH TAIL
[2:34:38] <Reveresao> If you pick up one card then drag it across the other cards you will pick up them up @WoolieVersus
[2:34:40] <GingaNZ> nah it was correct
[2:34:42] <Nikbottom> TO THE MOON
[2:34:43] <OblivionSword1> it's fine
[2:34:44] <+patel347> i would save the monk tho
[2:34:46] <+thedream_c> ALL IN
[2:34:47] <+Zyquux> playing Darius this early? his hand must be absolute trash
[2:34:48] <restingbones> Dont forget to look at where the little sword is
[2:34:50] <93lobo> Just play Yone next round if he doesn't attack right away
[2:34:51] <+thedream_c> wow they wanna eat 12?
[2:34:51] <MyNameIsRasus> if he trades elise here that's great
[2:34:54] <+AmericanSkidd> free
[2:34:55] <waterstealer> oh he just takes it
[2:34:56] <OblivionSword1> see
[2:34:56] <waterstealer> wow
[2:34:58] <BlackermanZX> oh wow he took it
[2:34:58] <pennykettle_> THICK damage
[2:34:58] <%madmanrambler> look at you out-aggroing the aggro deck
[2:35:01] <+nial_evol> hp is a resource
[2:35:02] <+thedream_c> AND u still got a big butt shield
[2:35:05] <MyNameIsRasus> yone if he plays anything
[2:35:05] <GingaNZ> yone
[2:35:07] <+Vampireinarm> play that shield bearer
[2:35:07] <waterstealer> hp as a resource
[2:35:09] <restingbones> Yone time :)
[2:35:11] <+patel347> until its 0 you are still in the game
[2:35:12] <%madmanrambler> ooh this is a bad time for him
[2:35:12] <pennykettle_> he could only block with 2 of those guys, and neither was great
[2:35:12] <munitalprats> yone here
[2:35:14] <Drizzydre116> Man's got a plan or a death wish
[2:35:16] <93lobo> Yone
[2:35:16] <+AmericanSkidd> they are desperate
[2:35:17] <munitalprats> stun the 2/2 and darius
[2:35:18] <+thedream_c> Yone stun?
[2:35:23] <urkleturtle> play the daybreak
[2:35:25] <munitalprats> yone is huge ghere
[2:35:25] <Crombells> yone to stun big boy and immortal boy is nice
[2:35:28] <emptyantics> Yone is gonna come in clutch
[2:35:28] <KgKid51> that was random asf
[2:35:29] <Nikbottom> Stunny Day
[2:35:30] <pennykettle_> Kreygasm yone
[2:35:33] <+thedream_c> ur igirl is leveld up too
[2:35:35] <+thedream_c> so every daybreak stuns
[2:35:36] <+nial_evol> stun on attack rd
[2:35:41] <+thedream_c> Leona NOW will stun on daybreak effx
[2:35:46] <GingaNZ> gg
[2:35:50] <munitalprats> i would have stunned the undying but this is fine
[2:35:53] <+thedream_c> but yeah this loks done
[2:35:58] <+EinTheBusinessDeer> Woolie's move is better though, Leona would be a single stun
[2:35:59] <%madmanrambler> soon as yasuo feels like showing up
[2:36:00] <+thedream_c> you are just breakngtheir tempo
[2:36:07] <MyNameIsRasus> don't block that
[2:36:08] <+thedream_c> even if yasuo don't show up
[2:36:08] <waterstealer> yup
[2:36:11] <Drizzydre116> @munitalprats no value in it, just take the 2
[2:36:16] <pennykettle_> undying is just 2 damage, not a big deal. the real problem is when enemy uses cards to kill undying
[2:36:24] <+thedream_c> Woolie is messing with tempo on how to atk/defend on turns that he's getting his
[2:36:28] <+AmericanSkidd> AYY
[2:36:28] <restingbones> oh no, 2 damage HahaLean
[2:36:28] <%madmanrambler> this guy seemed to have a bit of an awkward draw
[2:36:30] <munitalprats> @munitalprats There's absolutely value in it, he doesn't want to attack with elise
[2:36:30] <+EinTheBusinessDeer> there we goooooo
[2:36:33] <MyNameIsRasus> yasuo after the daybreak
[2:36:33] <OblivionSword1> there's the boy
[2:36:33] <GingaNZ> get him in
[2:36:33] <waterstealer> IS YA BOY
[2:36:34] <+thedream_c> yeah now u gotta bait/wait for undying
[2:36:35] <pennykettle_> 2 brothers
[2:36:39] <pelonsinvalle> daybreak
[2:36:46] <MyNameIsRasus> daybreak for stun
[2:36:48] <+EinTheBusinessDeer> daybreak into yasuo
[2:36:49] <Crombells> Solari is probably better
[2:36:52] <+thedream_c> yeah daybreak big body
[2:36:52] <waterstealer> daybreak first
[2:36:53] <+AmericanSkidd> brothaah
[2:36:55] <+goose_attack_almanac> If you recall Yone you can stun again next turn
[2:36:55] <+Vampireinarm> datbreak first
[2:37:01] <munitalprats> you need to daybreak in order to stun
[2:37:02] <munitalprats> with leona
[2:37:02] <%madmanrambler> ooh complex bits here
[2:37:04] <+thedream_c> 2 cost for daybreak and u wait for their response
[2:37:06] <munitalprats> so it's kinda complex
[2:37:08] <MyNameIsRasus> daybreak first always
[2:37:18] <+Abd0022> Daybreak Stuns
[2:37:18] <restingbones> daybreak first to stun
[2:37:19] <+thedream_c> IMO don't worry bout yasuo
[2:37:27] <+thedream_c> right now Leona has the board to kill
[2:37:28] <%madmanrambler> man poor darius didn't get to do anything this game
[2:37:41] <waterstealer> kinda like playing league
[2:37:43] <+dasmause> @madmanrambler welcome to leona's house
[2:37:44] <pelonsinvalle> Darius who

[2:37:55] <+Re_Volta> 2 mana one first
[2:37:56] <+thedream_c> oh yeah YONE is the better target
[2:37:59] <+CrabStealer> Giant Enemy Spider
[2:37:59] <+Vampireinarm> recall yone
[2:38:00] <+thedream_c> but yone is a 7 drop

[2:38:08] <%madmanrambler> yone is also a 6/6, he does a lot of damage right now
[2:38:10] <waterstealer> attack with him first
[2:38:13] <+AmericanSkidd> hell yeah
[2:38:14] <waterstealer> oof

[2:38:24] <+thedream_c> oh yeah Yauso for uick atk

[2:38:58] <+thedream_c> Yasuo also got quick atk so he's running over anyone
[2:39:00] <pelonsinvalle> you got the big combo going
[2:39:00] <+patel347> tbh you can do big dmg this turn
[2:39:01] <munitalprats> all in, and you win
[2:39:01] <+thedream_c> your opponent has

[2:39:15] <%madmanrambler> 'math is for blockers'
[2:39:16] <Nikbottom> very little
[2:39:17] <MyNameIsRasus> he's gonna have to trade badly
[2:39:18] <+thedream_c> and then death
[2:39:18] <restingbones> he can block and cry
[2:39:19] <+AmericanSkidd> inb4 sur
[2:39:21] <+patel347> he surrendors
[2:39:23] <waterstealer> EAT SHIT
[2:39:23] <munitalprats> he has to block and be sad
[2:39:26] <GingaNZ> die

[2:39:33] <+goose_attack_almanac> 5 direct, 3 from overwhelm, and the rest kills
[2:39:34] <Nikbottom> be sad now
[2:39:35] <+thedream_c> what do they have with 1 mana for defense?
[2:39:35] <+Hasmeister96> Either this guy blocks or surrenders
[2:39:40] <+goose_attack_almanac> gg
[2:39:49] <+patel347> new players will play till the end
[2:39:50] <OblivionSword1> oh he's thinking
[2:39:53] <MyNameIsRasus> he lost
[2:39:53] <pennykettle_> blocking an overwhelm like that is mathematically poor
[2:39:54] <%madmanrambler> yeah 3 damage coming through from leona, and even if he blocks everything he can't block one of the 3 power creatures
[2:39:54] <munitalprats> overwhelm baby

[2:40:44] <+patel347> @patel347 its very clear when the enemy has lethal though
[2:40:44] <Drizzydre116> I don't sur because there are always quest point to get
[2:40:46] <+bigcomfyman> I guess we really were the legends of runeterra after all
[2:40:47] <+AmericanSkidd> time to retire with 100% wr
[2:40:48] <Nikbottom> The winner immortal
[2:40:50] <Owlboy7> that was that guy fist game LUL
[2:40:51] <munitalprats> N E W D E C K
[2:40:52] <+EinTheBusinessDeer> woolie is close to getting free akshan cards
[2:40:53] <+thedream_c> 2 - 0 we did it boiz
[2:40:55] <munitalprats> Swain is dope
[2:40:57] <mrtanaka111> thinking toughts
[2:40:58] <%madmanrambler> but you did it
[2:40:59] <happy_void> let's hear em'
[2:40:59] <+thedream_c> time to put the sticks down and get a drink
[2:41:05] <Drizzydre116> 1 more win and you open the full game
[2:41:06] <Safarihat> ooh swain
[2:41:08] <user_naim> Well now we have a replacement for Disco Elysium
[2:41:11] <+EinTheBusinessDeer> woolie you honestly piloted that deck really well!
[2:41:12] <pennykettle_> this really is the league of legends of runeterra collectible card game
[2:41:13] <+patel347> @patel347 but i usually let them attack without wasting their time
[2:41:14] <waterstealer> swain and yas is a meta deck
[2:41:17] <+thedream_c> nah I just go MONKE with aggro decks
[2:41:18] <Nikbottom> its not a bad brain
[2:41:19] <MyNameIsRasus> you played really well
[2:41:20] <+thedream_c> thatshow I tink
[2:41:22] <+Re_Volta> oh they give a swain deck
[2:41:25] <pelonsinvalle> Big teppen player stomps LoR noobs
[2:41:25] <+Abd0022> Swain is COOL
[2:41:30] <MyNameIsRasus> A LOT
[2:41:30] <+thedream_c> at the same time the way I understand aggro is how I learn the game overall
[2:41:30] <Owlboy7> but there were only 450 players in teppen
[2:41:32] <93lobo> So many
[2:41:33] <%TomoeMoeGozen> a lot
[2:41:34] <93lobo> ALOT
[2:41:35] <+AmericanSkidd> many
[2:41:35] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:41:35] <%madmanrambler> depends on the combo, you can get a lot going
[2:41:35] <munitalprats> well think about it woolie
[2:41:35] <Jaysky> Swain is fun with Yasuo
[2:41:36] <+Vampireinarm> full board easy
[2:41:38] <OblivionSword1> a lot
[2:41:38] <%GinAndRoses> many stuns
[2:41:39] <+najaytheslug> Malphite stuns the entire board
[2:41:39] <+RenoDeGeneric> Too god damned many is the answer lol
[2:41:39] <Safarihat> a LOT
[2:41:39] <munitalprats> they can only have 6 cards
[2:41:39] <pennykettle_> leona actually has a hidden stun limit of like 5
[2:41:39] <GingaNZ> 6ish
[2:41:42] <Jaysky> Oh definitely
[2:41:43] <mrtanaka111> full board with setups
[2:41:43] <Deasmeister> yep
[2:41:45] <%TomoeMoeGozen> you can absolutely destroy a whole board
[2:41:46] <MyNameIsRasus> rhavun plus leona is nuts
[2:41:46] <+thedream_c> Swain TF is the more streamlined version
[2:41:46] <+patel347> theres a card that can stun the entire enemy line
[2:41:47] <KgKid51> Damn now I want to play
[2:41:49] <BlackermanZX> you got the big brain combos
[2:41:49] <Nikbottom> it feels good
[2:41:51] <Crombells> there are a bunch of stun spells there aren't in the deck
[2:41:51] <93lobo> Yassuo was Toxic when the game came out
[2:41:53] <+thedream_c> TF adds that flexibility
[2:41:54] <+goose_attack_almanac> You can search every card that has stun if you go to collection and search Stuhn
[2:41:54] <+RenoDeGeneric> You can stun the entire line with some Noxus cards
[2:41:54] <restingbones> Him and Swain has the most insane comboes
[2:41:54] <+AmericanSkidd> Yasuo and Swain are good for that
[2:41:56] <+Hasmeister96> @thedream_c true
[2:41:58] <mrtanaka111> there are cards that help with that outside your deck
[2:41:59] <%TomoeMoeGozen> i run a yasuo noxus/ionia deck that does that
[2:42:00] <munitalprats> Look at Noxus cards with stun
[2:42:00] <93lobo> Yes
[2:42:01] <+RedBandolier> Noxus has a shitton of stuns
[2:42:01] <Jaysky> Absolutely he can
[2:42:02] <munitalprats> noxus ionia
[2:42:03] <Kalcom> swain/yasuo deck was pretty good
[2:42:04] <+Vampireinarm> theres cards that stun the whole board in one go
[2:42:04] <Meltgar> LEAGUE OF WOOLIES?! Kappa
[2:42:05] <Safarihat> swain + boat = fun
[2:42:05] <%madmanrambler> oh for sure, take a look see in your collection
[2:42:08] <93lobo> Plenty of videos on that
[2:42:10] <MyNameIsRasus> there's a noxus card that stuns all six
[2:42:10] <macmens> yes its a yas swain deck you have the parts
[2:42:10] <%TomoeMoeGozen> noxus/ionia is your friend
[2:42:12] <+thedream_c> my more favorite partner with Yasuo happens to be Zoe :p
[2:42:14] <pennykettle_> infinite mindsplitter (the 8 cost dragon) stuns EVERY turn
[2:42:15] <+patel347> @WoolieVersus you can take a look at cards you dont own
[2:42:15] <Nikbottom> noxis is the way to go
[2:42:18] <+EinTheBusinessDeer> you give Yasuo a bunch of Minotaurs
[2:42:18] <Crombells> search stun and click "show unowned"
[2:42:20] <munitalprats> noxus/ionia has more stuns, typicall.
[2:42:20] <restingbones> @WoolieVersus Look at Swain for Max stun potential
[2:42:23] <%madmanrambler> so you'll want to click 'show unowned' and type in 'stun' on the search bar
[2:42:23] <Jaysky> Pat hates Yasuo
[2:42:29] <%madmanrambler> lol @Crombells and I on the same directions
[2:42:32] <waterstealer> in noxus
[2:42:33] <munitalprats> he's ion noxus
[2:42:33] <Daxalog> Make a new deck
[2:42:35] <pelonsinvalle> search bar
[2:42:36] <+thedream_c> Swain + his ships
[2:42:36] <munitalprats> make a new deck
[2:42:37] <Jaysky> You just got him
[2:42:38] <mrtanaka111> top
[2:42:38] <+Hasmeister96> Swain is in NOxus
[2:42:38] <+Re_Volta> you just got him yeah
[2:42:38] <pennykettle_> swain was other deck, cant go here
[2:42:39] <GingaNZ> just got
[2:42:39] <KgKid51> champs are already top row
[2:42:42] <MyNameIsRasus> change the region on the top
[2:42:42] <93lobo> Key word search Stun/Recall and click Show unowned cards on upper top of card library
[2:42:42] <+thedream_c> Swain has an 8 drop that gets him to your hand
[2:42:42] <+najaytheslug> Noxus
[2:42:42] <Jaysky> He's in Noxus
[2:42:45] <BlackermanZX> you got swain
[2:42:45] <mrtanaka111> go to filters
[2:42:46] <Nikbottom> he's noxus
[2:42:46] <+thedream_c> and YOU Need that 8 drop
[2:42:47] <Safarihat> swain is in the new deck
[2:42:49] <restingbones> He is in Noxus
[2:42:50] <munitalprats> He's in red
[2:42:52] <Kalcom> make a deck
[2:42:52] <+patel347> you need to remove filter
[2:42:53] <waterstealer> red region
[2:42:55] <munitalprats> make a new deck
[2:42:56] <+thedream_c> yeah switch to nox
[2:43:03] <KgKid51> swain SeemsGood SeemsGood
[2:43:09] <+thedream_c> thats easy
[2:43:12] <MyNameIsRasus> swain is pog
[2:43:13] <Daxalog> Make a new deck itll be easier
[2:43:14] <+goose_attack_almanac> From spells and skills
[2:43:16] <mrtanaka111> or skills
[2:43:17] <+Re_Volta> so from spells and skills yeah
[2:43:17] <%madmanrambler> so his nexus strike, yasuo striking, spells
[2:43:17] <MyNameIsRasus> spells, skills
[2:43:18] <+patel347> spells or abilities
[2:43:18] <Jaysky> So spells and stun/slashes
[2:43:18] <munitalprats> in spells or spell like effects
[2:43:18] <+thedream_c> FLOCK is a 1 cost that helps u there
[2:43:19] <%madmanrambler> stuff like that
[2:43:20] <mrtanaka111> like yasuo stryke
[2:43:21] <waterstealer> like yasuo stun damage
[2:43:21] <+najaytheslug> or skills
[2:43:22] <Nikbottom> Yasuo counts
[2:43:24] <+Abd0022> Yep and abilities
[2:43:25] <+Hasmeister96> yeah pretty much
[2:43:25] <+thedream_c> and swains spell is flock too
[2:43:26] <pennykettle_> spells usually, sometimes units can strike outside of combat
[2:43:31] <SomeAsianDood> swain is burn from skills and spells
[2:43:39] <munitalprats> or effects
[2:43:39] <+thedream_c> and nox has enough burn/life removal combo spells
[2:43:40] <munitalprats> not just spells
[2:43:42] <+Vampireinarm> burn deck
[2:43:43] <pelonsinvalle> yasuo strikes count
[2:43:43] <Crombells> you're searching Swain needs a lot of setup
[2:43:43] <MyNameIsRasus> there are a lot of those
[2:43:45] <+najaytheslug> Its sounds difficult, its super easy
[2:43:47] <GingaNZ> yass can do it
[2:43:49] <+Hasmeister96> Although I think the Irelia cards also count as non-combat damage
[2:43:51] <LoneFonte> not just spells, but effects
[2:43:51] <restingbones> Ergo, every time you ping the enemy nexus with swain on the Battlefield, he stuns a unit
[2:43:51] <urkleturtle> that's a lot of hoops to jump through to deal 5 to everything when you could just play Go Hard. but it's cool and I'm all for it!
[2:43:51] <The_Evil_Banana> Swain's Nexus Strike works
[2:43:52] <munitalprats> Yasuo's strikes count as non combat damage
[2:43:53] <$Rumbutt> Yasuo's ability would count for that right
[2:43:55] <Nikbottom> His boat is so fucking cool
[2:43:55] <pennykettle_> not just spells, like that unit that deals 1 damage to the enemy nexus
[2:43:57] <OblivionSword1> spells, skills, effects, etc.
[2:43:58] <Kalcom> yasuo is non combat damage
[2:44:01] <+thedream_c> swain decks usually like to pass turns too
[2:44:03] <+Re_Volta> yasuo covers that weakness a bit
[2:44:03] <Safarihat> yasuo does that too
[2:44:06] <+AmericanSkidd> they compliment each other when leveled
[2:44:06] <MyNameIsRasus> yasuo is non combat damage
[2:44:09] <%TomoeMoeGozen> look up intimidating roar spell woolie
[2:44:09] <pennykettle_> yeah!
[2:44:11] <restingbones> yes
[2:44:13] <MyNameIsRasus> it can also be to your units
[2:44:14] <+Vampireinarm> @Hasmeister96 if its on the board and you can block it its combat damage
[2:44:22] <TheLordBeerus> You don't need to defend if you kill the opponents units with spells Kappa
[2:44:22] <+Zyquux> @hasmeister96 blade dance doesnt count as combat damage? that doesn't make sense
[2:44:22] <MyNameIsRasus> 1 cost btw
[2:44:27] <LoneFonte> any damage that isn't just the cards hitting each other
[2:44:30] <+patel347> yeah so if you have both leveled, he can just delte the entire backline lol
[2:44:37] <munitalprats> You'd need to run swain over leona in this case
[2:44:38] <nechronia> Noxus has a decent amount of good stun support as well
[2:44:39] <%madmanrambler> you'd have to leave your targon buddies
[2:44:40] <waterstealer> noxus has tons of stun cards
[2:44:41] <+thedream_c> most of the spells that support swain are common
[2:44:41] <MyNameIsRasus> you would have to make another deck
[2:44:41] <KgKid51> swain and twisted is goated
[2:44:42] <%madmanrambler> and that's a tough sell
[2:44:42] <TheLordBeerus> @Zyquux Blade dances attack through combat, they just start a free combat.
[2:44:43] <munitalprats> you'd need to cut your daybreak cards
[2:44:48] <munitalprats> but it's an option
[2:44:48] <+Hasmeister96> @Hasmeister96 OK my mistake
[2:44:50] <waterstealer> ioneeeea
[2:44:50] <munitalprats> Only 2 colors
[2:44:50] <+RenoDeGeneric> You can make an Ionia-Noxus deck
[2:44:53] <KgKid51> only 2
[2:44:54] <MyNameIsRasus> only 2
[2:44:54] <+thedream_c> nah
[2:44:54] <+najaytheslug> Only 2
[2:44:55] <Jaysky> No
[2:44:55] <+Re_Volta> only two colours
[2:44:55] <+Abd0022> no
[2:44:55] <Crombells> only two regions
[2:44:55] <restingbones> only 2
[2:44:56] <+thedream_c> only 2
[2:44:56] <%TomoeMoeGozen> only 2
[2:44:56] <%madmanrambler> unfortunately only 2 factions
[2:44:57] <pennykettle_> only 2 in standard
[2:44:57] <waterstealer> no
[2:44:58] <munitalprats> in the standard rules, only 2
[2:44:58] <+AmericanSkidd> only 2
[2:45:00] <OblivionSword1> you can only have 2 region
[2:45:03] <Nikbottom> you would drop targon
[2:45:04] <+Zyquux> @thelordbeerus that's what I thought lol
[2:45:06] <%TomoeMoeGozen> remove the targon cards and put in nexus
[2:45:06] <+Re_Volta> so you'd replace leona
[2:45:07] <%TomoeMoeGozen> noxus
[2:45:08] <Kalcom> make new deck or change this one
[2:45:08] <pennykettle_> The fun is mix and matching regions
[2:45:09] <+thedream_c> IMO 3 would really complicate things
[2:45:10] <Jaysky> You just got another deck with Swain to test out
[2:45:20] <93lobo> You can lookup keywords like "Stun" or "Recall" in search bar on the top UI and show unowned cards by pushing the "show unowned button"
[2:45:23] <+Hasmeister96> @Zyquux OK I think free combat was the thing I was thinking of sorry
[2:45:26] <MyNameIsRasus> you'd have to make a new deck to have swain and yasuo
[2:45:27] <+thedream_c> so 2 is a good way to tighten things
[2:45:30] <+Zyquux> "you can only have 2 regions" *laughs in Labs*
[2:45:32] <Jaysky> Also you should try the Lab of Legends to just try out champs
[2:45:33] <nechronia> Sunhawk is a good card for Leona Yasuo
[2:45:33] <+thedream_c> yeah make 2 deck
[2:45:40] <+EinTheBusinessDeer> The next region that's coming out looks like it's gonna region mix super hard with duel region cards
[2:45:43] <munitalprats> you can create a new deck and pick Noxus and Ionia
[2:45:45] <+RenoDeGeneric> Runeterra has some pure deck strats
[2:45:58] <+najaytheslug> Swain is pretty viable, yasuo is weaker
[2:45:59] <munitalprats> there are multiple noxus cards which stun btw
[2:46:01] <+Zyquux> even with allegiance, you almost never want a mono region deck.
[2:46:02] <+thedream_c> depending on some strats there are pure deck strats
[2:46:05] <munitalprats> search Stun
[2:46:07] <%TomoeMoeGozen> look at intimidating roar
[2:46:07] <+thedream_c> like pure Shurima... sorta
[2:46:09] <munitalprats> in noxus
[2:46:10] <Crombells> noxus does have a lot of stun
[2:46:12] <Safarihat> look up leviathan
[2:46:13] <+thedream_c> and pure Demacia elites
[2:46:14] <restingbones> Try typing "Stun" into the search bar
[2:46:14] <MyNameIsRasus> click show unowed
[2:46:15] <+Hasmeister96> @EinTheBusinessDeer Wait a new region is coming?
[2:46:20] <Nikbottom> SENTRY
[2:46:20] <sparked963> show unowned
[2:46:22] <urkleturtle> you can have only 2 regions in ranked, but all the regions in expeditions and the singleplayer modes
[2:46:22] <%TomoeMoeGozen> i want you to just see intimidating roar
[2:46:22] <%madmanrambler> lee[ om ,omd tjat
[2:46:23] <munitalprats> search stun
[2:46:24] <pennykettle_> whirling death is a great card for Swain
[2:46:26] <TheLordBeerus> @Hasmeister96 Yes, bandle city
[2:46:27] <munitalprats> it's a goal
[2:46:35] <GingaNZ> you have a bunch
[2:46:37] <waterstealer> INTIMIDATING ROAR
[2:46:40] <MyNameIsRasus> it's a goal, and the game lets you get noxus cards real quick
[2:46:42] <munitalprats> INTIMIDATING ROAR
[2:46:43] <+thedream_c> there is a 3 drop that makes a stun
[2:46:44] <pennykettle_> yea you start gaining cards from the last reward in the prologue screen
[2:46:46] <%madmanrambler> slow speed though
[2:46:49] <+thedream_c> but its slow speed
[2:46:50] <MyNameIsRasus> slow though
[2:46:54] <+thedream_c> so u gotta set the tempo to make it work
[2:46:57] <+patel347> intimidating roar tho
[2:46:59] <MyNameIsRasus> speed matters in costs
[2:46:59] <%madmanrambler> yeah there's some costs here, but its a very eye-catching 1 mana card
[2:47:03] <munitalprats> They could recall it
[2:47:03] <+EinTheBusinessDeer> @EinTheBusinessDeer Bandle City is coming in August. It looks like Yordles are gonna be Bandle City / Whatever Region they exist in
[2:47:06] <+serrisirres> Leviathan, Arachnoid Sentry, Ravenous Flock, Thorn of the Rose, Intimidating Roar, all cards to look at.
[2:47:06] <TheLordBeerus> You'll want thorn of the rose since it generates those alongside a unit
[2:47:06] <+najaytheslug> yes
[2:47:07] <munitalprats> or counte spell
[2:47:09] <+thedream_c> yes
[2:47:10] <munitalprats> there are counterspells
[2:47:10] <Deasmeister> yes
[2:47:10] <restingbones> they may counter it
[2:47:10] <MyNameIsRasus> yes
[2:47:11] <+serrisirres> Yes
[2:47:12] <Jaysky> Yep
[2:47:12] <waterstealer> yes
[2:47:12] <%madmanrambler> they could recall it, or use a counter spell yeah
[2:47:13] <+patel347> yes
[2:47:13] <93lobo> Yes
[2:47:13] <+Re_Volta> yes, in ionia
[2:47:13] <+thedream_c> from Shurima def
[2:47:14] <Nikbottom> sure

[2:48:40] <+Zyquux> *laughs in Freljord*
[2:48:40] <%TomoeMoeGozen> I'VE BEEN SAYIN

[2:48:43] <KgKid51> unless they deny it
[2:48:46] <+Hasmeister96> Well if the enemy is weak enough

[2:49:03] <+Re_Volta> with fast things lol
[2:49:04] <GingaNZ> wait till they are low in mana

[2:49:05] <+AmericanSkidd> ionia has deny
[2:49:07] <+najaytheslug> deny
[2:49:09] <waterstealer> deny
[2:49:10] <KgKid51> counter there deny
[2:49:10] <pennykettle_> slow aint bad, they need a fast or burst spell which specifically answers
[2:49:10] <+bigcomfyman> woolies getting the tingles
[2:49:10] <sparked963> force enemy to use mana
[2:49:12] <OblivionSword1> it'll clear trash from the boards
[2:49:12] <+patel347> you look at how much mana they have
[2:49:13] <Deasmeister> Can you counter deny
[2:49:13] <munitalprats> look up deny
[2:49:14] <%madmanrambler> there are also spellshields
[2:49:15] <+thedream_c> trades
[2:49:16] <+Hasmeister96> There's a specific card that stops spells

[2:49:26] <munitalprats> It's in ionia
[2:49:30] <TheLordBeerus> Deny and Nopify
[2:49:32] <nechronia> There are 3 counterspells in the game and they are only in Ionia and Shurima
[2:49:32] <%madmanrambler> time to dig out the keyboard and start thinking
[2:49:38] <+AmericanSkidd> we labbing?
[2:49:38] <OblivionSword1> ionia has a spell called deny
[2:49:38] <93lobo> Spell Shield, Nulify and Deny

[2:49:41] <Jaysky> @WoolieVersus Look at the lore for Deny, it's great
[2:49:42] <+Abd0022> Ionia
[2:49:43] <Crombells> there are only counters in twonly ionia and shurima can counter spells
[2:49:45] <%TomoeMoeGozen> change to ionia
[2:49:45] <Nikbottom> I'm here for it
[2:49:45] <%Exiliator> Paint Kappa
[2:49:46] <%madmanrambler> this is quietly one of my favorite bits of these decks
[2:50:00] <TheLordBeerus> Look for Nopify too
[2:50:01] <+Zyquux> Woolie is that shoestring whiteboard meme
[2:50:09] <MyNameIsRasus> that's the dreambreaker right there
[2:50:12] <+goose_attack_almanac> Look up Nopify
[2:50:14] <Jaysky> Look at big lore for Deny Woolz
[2:50:15] <GingaNZ> counter spell only Ionia can use
[2:50:15] <OblivionSword1> so be careefull around ionia deck
[2:50:16] <Lancaster_H> H A L T

[2:51:36] <restingbones> ??
[2:51:37] <MyNameIsRasus> not quite
[2:51:42] <+RenoDeGeneric> Turns only end after both players pass, you can keep going back and forth a lot
[2:51:42] <GeoGio3> did he do the tutorials?
[2:51:43] <+patel347> no you keep passaing
[2:51:45] <GingaNZ> not quite, but close
[2:51:48] <+Zyquux> not really
[2:51:48] <+AmericanSkidd> it goes back and forth till someone doesnt play a card
[2:51:49] <Crombells> there's no middle beginning or end, there is only passive board and during an attack
[2:51:49] <+najaytheslug> initiative
[2:51:52] <93lobo> Before the fight, During the fight and after the fight
[2:51:56] <pelonsinvalle> there's no yugioh phases
[2:51:58] <+patel347> its during the battle its what you say
[2:51:59] <Deasmeister> No you can keep playing until both pass
[2:51:59] <%tactician0> --------+++++++
[2:52:00] <pelonsinvalle> but kinda
[2:52:00] <MyNameIsRasus> the turn continues until both players pass after doing nothing
[2:52:01] <pennykettle_> rounds go on forever until both players do nothing on their turn. then the next round, the other player gets the attack token
[2:52:01] <sparked963> theres out of battle, in battle, anytime
[2:52:03] <%tactician0> +++++++
[2:52:06] <emptyantics> You’re just passing an attack puck
[2:52:10] <GingaNZ> think of it like combat and non combat
[2:52:11] <munitalprats> out of battle, in battle, anytime
[2:52:14] <TheSaltminer> woolie learning the lore before Project L?
[2:52:14] <munitalprats> YES
[2:52:15] <pennykettle_> yes
[2:52:17] <+Zyquux> yes
[2:52:17] <+Abd0022> Yes
[2:52:17] <waterstealer> YES
[2:52:19] <sparked963> yes
[2:52:19] <%madmanrambler> so whenever your opponent does something where it goes on the stack, you get a chance to respond. so in your example, you play intimidating roar. your opponent has a chance to respond, then if they responded you can respond.
[2:52:19] <+RenoDeGeneric> Yeah forever
[2:52:19] <+najaytheslug> yes
[2:52:20] <+RedBandolier> yep
[2:52:20] <munitalprats> There's a cap of like 13
[2:52:20] <+Re_Volta> maximum is 9 i think
[2:52:20] <GingaNZ> yes
[2:52:20] <93lobo> Yes
[2:52:20] <+goose_attack_almanac> YEP
[2:52:20] <emptyantics> YEZ
[2:52:21] <MyNameIsRasus> if you have the mana
[2:52:22] <+CrabStealer> Theoretically infinite yeah
[2:52:22] <munitalprats> or 9
[2:52:23] <pennykettle_> yep
[2:52:24] <+najaytheslug> ITS A STACK
[2:52:24] <munitalprats> there's a cap of 9
[2:52:24] <+AmericanSkidd> yes
[2:52:25] <+Hasmeister96> Yes
[2:52:26] <Crombells> infinite turns so long as both players don't pass
[2:52:29] <sparked963> some spells cost 0 and you can just keep going
[2:52:29] <GeoGio3> yeh
[2:52:29] <GingaNZ> that's why this game is great
[2:52:36] <SomeAsianDood> Yup you can always react
[2:52:38] <hentaimancometh> Yes
[2:52:39] <93lobo> There are cards that give you mana back
[2:52:39] <pennykettle_> infinite turns until both players pass their turn in a row
[2:52:42] <MyNameIsRasus> that's the cool shit in this game
[2:52:53] <restingbones> Okay so, this game does not have phases. Instead people keep playing until both players have passed, in between then players take turns to either play a card or attack.
[2:52:57] <+TestAnon> You can also attack first and not let them react with a slow spell or follower @woolieversus
[2:53:00] <munitalprats> that's exactly it
[2:53:02] <MyNameIsRasus> it ends when both players pass
[2:53:03] <sparked963> sometimes whole turns are all spell based
[2:53:05] <urkleturtle> there's no phases so to speak. just giving your opponent priority once you do anything that isn't attacking or using a burst spell
[2:53:07] <munitalprats> when both players pass, the turn ends
[2:53:09] <munitalprats> LEGION GENERAAAL
[2:53:10] <Nikbottom> Big Brain zone
[2:53:11] <Crombells> a new round begins once players have passed without playing anything consecutively
[2:53:11] <+goose_attack_almanac> Every Action you take that ends your "Turn" gives the enemy a chance to follow-up. Unless they pass it up
[2:53:11] <munitalprats> HES SO GOOD
[2:53:14] <munitalprats> LOOK AT LEGION GENERAL TOO
[2:53:15] <Jaysky> You receive: -Many Stuns. I receive: -Your nexus.
[2:53:17] <+Zyquux> yes, think in terms of reactions instead of turns
[2:53:24] <MyNameIsRasus> it used to be 3
[2:53:26] <munitalprats> 40
[2:53:27] <+najaytheslug> as long as you have something to do the turn can keep going but initiative is passed back and forth
[2:53:28] <%madmanrambler> its also a rare, which is not cheap just yet
[2:53:30] <munitalprats> it's a cap of 40
[2:53:33] <GingaNZ> 3 of that could be banked
[2:53:33] <+AmericanSkidd> remember when deny was 3
[2:53:33] <+goose_attack_almanac> Look at Nopify
[2:53:34] <MyNameIsRasus> yes
[2:53:39] <munitalprats> Legion general is so good
[2:53:41] <Kalcom> you dont need it yet
[2:53:43] <+disgruntledgruntle> Chat, did Woolz win his first pvp game?
[2:53:46] <restingbones> Every round lasts until both players pass yes.
[2:53:48] <%madmanrambler> yep
[2:53:50] <+Zyquux> what were they thinking releasing deny at 3
[2:53:58] <munitalprats> legion general is so good :)
[2:53:59] <+Zyquux> @disgruntledgruntle yes
[2:54:04] <+disgruntledgruntle> Pog
[2:54:05] <%madmanrambler> they were thinking 'cancel in magic is usually kinda bad at 3 and this is more limited'
[2:54:06] <restingbones> @disgruntledgruntle he won BOTH of his firsts pvps yes
[2:54:12] <+Zyquux> legion general is cool
[2:54:14] <MyNameIsRasus> grant is permanent
[2:54:16] <munitalprats> BIG boy
[2:54:23] <GingaNZ> permanent buff
[2:54:30] <%madmanrambler> and it'll count bouncing your own guys
[2:54:33] <%madmanrambler> lotta cool options
[2:54:37] <+Hasmeister96> It's basically like Nasus
[2:54:44] <munitalprats> Minotaur Reckoner is also pog
[2:54:45] <Safarihat> leviathan is usually the punctuation
[2:54:47] <MyNameIsRasus> on attack
[2:54:49] <Crombells> minotaur reckoner is better than aurok glinthorn
[2:54:50] <urkleturtle> and fearsome means he's not gonna get chump blocked
[2:54:53] <munitalprats> yes
[2:54:54] <munitalprats> exactly
[2:54:55] <pennykettle_> yes
[2:54:55] <SomeAsianDood> It is your closer for a yasuo deck
[2:54:55] <waterstealer> yes
[2:54:57] <MyNameIsRasus> yes
[2:54:57] <+Hasmeister96> yeah
[2:54:57] <GingaNZ> ultra good
[2:54:57] <+Zyquux> yep
[2:54:58] <+najaytheslug> on attack
[2:54:59] <+Abd0022> yes
[2:54:59] <restingbones> Yeah, but he is kind of a deeyup
[2:55:00] <+CrabStealer> Yup
[2:55:00] <waterstealer> insantly
[2:55:02] <Nikbottom> thats a wierd one
[2:55:02] <Jaysky> When he attacks
[2:55:09] <+serrisirres> Whenever he attacks, yes
[2:55:13] <Nikbottom> BOAT
[2:55:16] <munitalprats> this is a tutor
[2:55:17] <Safarihat> BOAT

[2:55:21] <+najaytheslug> BOAT
[2:55:22] <Crombells> it's a ship
[2:55:23] <munitalprats> It can attack
[2:55:24] <+Zyquux> Noxus used to be the go to Yasuo region before Targon
[2:55:25] <+najaytheslug> no
[2:55:25] <waterstealer> its not a landmark
[2:55:25] <%madmanrambler> ooh a card you might like is retreat, it's very cool and has a bunch of optional moves to it, can be super fun alongside certain ionia decks
[2:55:26] <+Re_Volta> still a unit
[2:55:26] <MyNameIsRasus> no, this is a unit
[2:55:26] <+AmericanSkidd> no
[2:55:28] <SomeAsianDood> Boat Pog
[2:55:28] <pennykettle_> it just acts like a unit. its not a landmark
[2:55:28] <+Hasmeister96> No, it isn't a landmark
[2:55:28] <restingbones> Its a HUGE FUCKING SHIP

[2:56:12] <GingaNZ> it's crazy good
[2:56:12] <urkleturtle> i wouldn't play 8 cost cards unless it's part of a game-winning combo
[2:56:14] <Jaysky> And Swain gets 3 non-damage each turn it exists
[2:56:17] <Safarihat> it makes swain stun 3 units per turn
[2:56:18] <Jaysky> Swain is mid-late

[2:56:25] <munitalprats> it needs to be on the board
[2:56:26] <%madmanrambler> nah has to be on the field
[2:56:26] <restingbones> No
[2:56:26] <pennykettle_> has to be on board
[2:56:27] <%GinAndRoses> no has to be in play
[2:56:28] <waterstealer> you have toplay it
[2:56:28] <+TestAnon> no
[2:56:29] <munitalprats> yeah
[2:56:29] <+CrabStealer> No, it has to be in play
[2:56:30] <+dasmause> you have to play it
[2:56:30] <Jaysky> No it needs to be alive
[2:56:31] <munitalprats> on the backrow
[2:56:32] <Nikbottom> yes
[2:56:32] <93lobo> It has to be on the board
[2:56:32] <munitalprats> no
[2:56:33] <restingbones> Yes
[2:56:34] <munitalprats> it can be o nthe backrow
[2:56:36] <+Abd0022> no after you summon it
[2:56:37] <+dasmause> you dont have to attack with it though
[2:56:37] <+patel347> no if its on the backrow
[2:56:38] <restingbones> back row?
[2:56:38] <pennykettle_> OH on backrow yes, doesnt have to fight
[2:56:39] <%madmanrambler> you do have to summon it, backrow means the guys who aren't attacking
[2:56:40] <MyNameIsRasus> you can never attack with it
[2:56:40] <%GinAndRoses> yes backrow it will do it, just not in hand
[2:56:41] <+patel347> it will still work
[2:56:41] <Daxalog> Backrow
[2:56:43] <OblivionSword1> it can be on the backrow too
[2:56:43] <+Hasmeister96> You don't have to attack with it
[2:56:44] <Nikbottom> it dosn't have to attack
[2:56:47] <+nocturne_reverie> yugioh field effects basically
[2:56:47] <GingaNZ> it does not need to fight
[2:56:47] <+CrabStealer> It can be on the backrow, but not in hand
[2:56:47] <+goose_attack_almanac> Look at Swains abilioty though
[2:56:49] <munitalprats> yeah its a finisher
[2:56:51] <Nikbottom> yup
[2:56:51] <SomeAsianDood> It doesn't have to attack
[2:56:51] <+Zyquux> the boats are ways to guarantee you get your champion
[2:56:52] <MyNameIsRasus> correct
[2:56:53] <+patel347> yes
[2:56:55] <munitalprats> It puts the opponent on a clock
[2:56:55] <restingbones> yes
[2:56:55] <+TestAnon> they can kill with spells and challenger
[2:56:58] <+AmericanSkidd> yeah it becomes a big problem
[2:57:02] <+najaytheslug> he auto enables swain
[2:57:08] <+goose_attack_almanac> Look at Swains ability again though.
[2:57:13] <pennykettle_> you can start getting these cards when you finish the prologue on the reward tab
[2:57:13] <munitalprats> It's just a goal to think about Woolie
[2:57:14] <GeoGio3> yasuo + swain incoming
[2:57:15] <+goose_attack_almanac> It allows him to stun 3 times
[2:57:15] <%madmanrambler> yeah I'd say right now you should just keep playing premade decks until you unlock more options
[2:57:19] <emptyantics> Check out swains ability
[2:57:29] <93lobo> Woolie Expedition and Labs are a good way to learn the game.
[2:57:31] <MyNameIsRasus> you can get most of those in like a week playing an hour everyday with quests and rewards
[2:57:32] <SomeAsianDood> Lore fact: The Leviathan is no longer swain's ship. It was stolen by GP and is now part of his fleet!
[2:57:33] <+AmericanSkidd> if you play daily you get cards easy
[2:57:45] <+Zyquux> You can get a deck code for a Swain/Yasuo deck and it'll tell you what cards you're missing
[2:57:48] <pennykettle_> up to 3 right?
[2:57:52] <restingbones> you can have 3 technically
[2:57:54] <pennykettle_> you just own 2
[2:57:59] <MyNameIsRasus> you can have 3, you just own 2
[2:58:00] <%madmanrambler> up to 3 normally, he hasn't picked up the third yet yeah
[2:58:08] <pelonsinvalle> add darius just to be a closer
[2:58:09] <pennykettle_> You can have up to 6 total Champions in your deck
[2:58:14] <%TomoeMoeGozen> you only own 1
[2:58:19] <emptyantics> You can have 3 of the samw champion
[2:58:20] <Kalcom> search stun
[2:58:21] <+nocturne_reverie> dont forget you have a search if you dont wanna scroll through
[2:58:22] <+goose_attack_almanac> LOOK AT MINAH
[2:58:24] <%TomoeMoeGozen> you gotta get more
[2:58:26] <+Hasmeister96> Bro if you grind out the rewards and the weekly vaults, deck building will be a possibility
[2:58:38] <munitalprats> i don't think you can
[2:58:41] <%madmanrambler> champion rarity up top
[2:58:41] <pelonsinvalle> champs are all on the top
[2:58:41] <munitalprats> champions are always at the top
[2:58:43] <%madmanrambler> there ya go
[2:58:46] <GingaNZ> champs are up the top
[2:58:49] <Crombells> all champions are at the top
[2:58:52] <%madmanrambler> yeah you don't have a ton yet
[2:58:53] <pelonsinvalle> show unowned
[2:58:54] <sparked963> Minah is nice. def saved me more than a few times
[2:59:08] <+Re_Volta> put saboteur in there
[2:59:11] <restingbones> might as well
[2:59:17] <pennykettle_> arent these just the base game ones? The rest of the cards wont show up til prologue complete?
[2:59:24] <MyNameIsRasus> might is great
[2:59:28] <Crombells> probably put in two Zed if you don't have more of your main champs, he's just a good low cost unit in general
[2:59:30] <hentaimancometh> Show unowned
[2:59:35] <munitalprats> @pennykettle_ Swains not from the basegame
[2:59:43] <+AmericanSkidd> he will level in the deck
[2:59:44] <+Zyquux> @pennykettle_ I'm pretty sure he could theoretically get Shuriman cards if he wanted.
[2:59:46] <restingbones> you need spell and abily damage in this deck
[2:59:46] <%TomoeMoeGozen> minah is fantastic
[2:59:48] <munitalprats> Swain levels in deck
[2:59:54] <restingbones> otherwise Swain is useless
[2:59:59] <munitalprats> you definitely want ways to level swain up
[3:00:09] <GingaNZ> take it
[3:00:11] <+Re_Volta> more copies to draw
[3:00:12] <waterstealer> its a good card
[3:00:13] <+patel347> its just a really good card on its own
[3:00:13] <munitalprats> Champion Spells are not the same
[3:00:14] <munitalprats> it's more copies
[3:00:14] <+Hasmeister96> yes
[3:00:20] <restingbones> because its 4 damage for 1 mana at fast speed
[3:00:21] <Kalcom> more
[3:00:21] <+serrisirres> You only have the Ravenous Flock on Swain if you draw two Swains and play one
[3:00:25] <93lobo> Swain turns into that card if you have a Swain in hand while one is on the Board
[3:00:26] <+Zyquux> if you lose both swains then you won't have any ravenous flocks
[3:00:31] <%TomoeMoeGozen> fae is good
[3:00:32] <sinbad2058> when one swain is in play the other becomes that card
[3:00:33] <+goose_attack_almanac> The other one only turns into theSwain version if you have him on the board
[3:00:36] <+serrisirres> You want as many Ravenous Flocks as possible, its really strong
[3:00:40] <munitalprats> It's a card to help level up Swain
[3:00:43] <+serrisirres> P much want the full six
[3:00:57] <restingbones> Or in this case, if you lose even 1 Swain you wont, cos you only have 2
[3:01:01] <+RedBandolier> so you could add Ravenous Flock if you really wanted 4 (or up to 6) copies of it in your deck, which could be good if your stunning stuff
[3:01:03] <munitalprats> yup
[3:01:04] <munitalprats> exactly
[3:01:06] <+Hasmeister96> yea
[3:01:08] <restingbones> yes
[3:01:11] <%madmanrambler> ravenous flock is interesting. dealing 4 is a *lot*, but usually you're only getting to do it if you already spent a card stunning or damaging the enemy
[3:01:11] <+Abd0022> Yep
[3:01:13] <+Zyquux> @restingbones true, forgot about that lol
[3:01:26] <munitalprats> Arachnoise is huge her
[3:01:27] <MyNameIsRasus> Swain's ravenous flock only appears if you two in hand and summon one, the remaining swain turns into ravenous as long as the other swain is on board
[3:01:28] <munitalprats> here
[3:01:36] <GingaNZ> you need noxian furvor
[3:01:36] <Nikbottom> sentry is good
[3:01:46] <restingbones> Get that spider and bladewhirler in there friend
[3:01:46] <munitalprats> Ided also look up "damage" i think
[3:01:54] <Crombells> decisive is really expensive, definitely make the units that creat a guile in hand
[3:02:02] <munitalprats> click the number
[3:02:08] <%madmanrambler> so you drop it in and it goes where its mana goes
[3:02:09] <restingbones> just click the card
[3:02:11] <Nikbottom> by cost
[3:02:11] <waterstealer> you can just clisk the card multiple times
[3:02:11] <+Zyquux> ah, the classic "search a word and put all those cards in" method of deck building. that's how I do it too.
[3:02:12] <munitalprats> they go in mana order
[3:02:13] <+nocturne_reverie> card level
[3:02:14] <+Re_Volta> its organized by cost
[3:02:18] <+goose_attack_almanac> cost
[3:02:24] <OblivionSword1> it's sort by cost
[3:02:24] <munitalprats> also search damage
[3:02:30] <munitalprats> because you want cards that deal damage out of combat, fyi
[3:02:43] <restingbones> Youre def gonna want both Spiders
[3:02:43] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:02:47] <munitalprats> I think you can create ghost decks somehow
[3:02:48] <pennykettle_> It does?
[3:02:50] <munitalprats> if you import decks it does
[3:02:55] <GingaNZ> you can
[3:02:56] <pennykettle_> I swear you could
[3:02:57] <%madmanrambler> the only way to really do that is import a deck
[3:03:02] <+Zyquux> you need a deck code, but it does it
[3:03:03] <%TomoeMoeGozen> you can import decks and it'll be a ghost deck
[3:03:05] <Nikbottom> only works on imports
[3:03:05] <Safarihat> you can if you import it
[3:03:07] <Lancaster_H> you can by importing
[3:03:09] <+MGSKomodoDragon> you can do the same here. click "Show Unowned" At the top
[3:03:09] <OblivionSword1> I thought you could
[3:03:10] <Crombells> there's probably a site for making ghost decks, importing a deck code creates ghost decks
[3:03:11] <MyNameIsRasus> you can import decks with cards you don't own, but you can't create it sadly
[3:03:13] <sparked963> you can make them on a website can import the code
[3:03:16] <%madmanrambler> yeah unfortunately
[3:03:19] <OblivionSword1> bummer
[3:03:22] <Panda_Boxer> does anyone know if there's crossplay between mobile and pc?
[3:03:23] <%TomoeMoeGozen> you can make it on a website then import it
[3:03:25] <%madmanrambler> you don't own deny yet
[3:03:26] <munitalprats> deny is a rare card
[3:03:27] <MyNameIsRasus> show unowed
[3:03:30] <%madmanrambler> so you'd have to spend crystals making it
[3:03:38] <+goose_attack_almanac> Death Lotus is also good for Swain
[3:03:39] <%TomoeMoeGozen> @Panda_Boxer there is
[3:03:39] <+bigcomfyman> by the time you'd normally build decks you'd have so much material it wouldn't matter
[3:03:39] <Daxalog> Can you craft it?
[3:03:41] <pelonsinvalle> noxus low costs cards have a lot of non-combat damage
[3:03:44] <Kalcom> dont need it yet
[3:03:44] <Nikbottom> Sad
[3:03:45] <munitalprats> big boo
[3:03:47] <GingaNZ> you need damage spells
[3:03:47] <munitalprats> don't need it yet tho
[3:03:51] <munitalprats> this is all hypothetical stuff anyway
[3:03:55] <Daxalog> You can make one
[3:03:56] <GingaNZ> noxian furvor
[3:03:59] <Kalcom> when you win more and you get stronger opponents
[3:04:04] <+Re_Volta> still low on resources, focus on damage
[3:04:05] <Panda_Boxer> @TomoeMoeGozen ah, good to hear, thanks
[3:04:11] <%madmanrambler> nah I totally get where woolie is coming from, this does suck
[3:04:16] <MyNameIsRasus> trust me woolz, after you leave the prologue the game just throws cards at you
[3:04:18] <pennykettle_> That's so weird, I swear you could add ghost cards
[3:04:21] <munitalprats> the gems you get from duplicates
[3:04:24] <munitalprats> the blue is a wildcard
[3:04:27] <pennykettle_> dont spend the dust, just finish the prologue
[3:04:28] <munitalprats> it can be usedo n any rare card
[3:04:28] <+nial_evol> 3rd currency are wildcards
[3:04:29] <MyNameIsRasus> blue is wildcards which is also free
[3:04:33] <Daxalog> he colored things are wildcards
[3:04:34] <Safarihat> @WoolieVersus ive made a yasuo swain deck do you want to import mine?
[3:04:38] <+Re_Volta> finish the prologue first yeah
[3:04:43] <GeoGio3> buy same colored cards
[3:04:44] <+Re_Volta> oh well ok lol
[3:04:45] <%madmanrambler> yeah you'll be fine making a few cards
[3:04:46] <pennykettle_> You unlock cards really fast once you finish the prologue
[3:04:47] <%madmanrambler> its not a big deal
[3:04:50] <+RenoDeGeneric> Blue is wildcard, gives you any card of same value
[3:04:59] <+Zyquux> the green shards are the free currency you get from getting duplicates. the 3rd option is wild cards you get from rewards.
[3:05:00] <restingbones> The coloured cards are "Wild cards", you get them some times and they can be turned in for any card of that rarity.
[3:05:02] <Nikbottom> we can handle it
[3:05:04] <urkleturtle> yeah rare wildcards are easy to come by
[3:05:06] <+bigcomfyman> free shit is from duplicates, the blue is a wildcard and is a free unlock for one of that rarity card
[3:05:06] <%madmanrambler> time to get some losers in here now
[3:05:09] <munitalprats> you also want cards that deal damage
[3:05:10] <%CaptainPileDriver> has anyone made a "The Room" joke about Deny
[3:05:22] <pelonsinvalle> check out low level noxus minions
[3:05:23] <restingbones> You want 2 of those spiders.
[3:05:25] <%madmanrambler> ooh get a second darius in there yeah, free add
[3:05:37] <+Zyquux> Grenadier will be good for Swain
[3:05:41] <munitalprats> grenadier
[3:05:44] <Kalcom> you want a 1 or 2 drop
[3:05:44] <munitalprats> early noxus cards, think early
[3:05:44] <GingaNZ> noxian furvor is the best card for this
[3:05:45] <%madmanrambler> you can also drag and drop the card multiple times, that's its own option
[3:05:54] <MyNameIsRasus> saboteur and grenadier are great
[3:06:00] <ofernando_lor> after you finish the prologue you can get more cards
[3:06:01] <munitalprats> misspell
[3:06:07] <Panda_Boxer> i'm pretty new to runeterra, the last thing i did was finish those challenge match things, haven't even played against a human yet
[3:06:11] <%madmanrambler> the captain is also good here
[3:06:12] <munitalprats> you get more cards after the prologue though
[3:06:16] <MyNameIsRasus> only own one
[3:06:17] <restingbones> I love Farron
[3:06:23] <GingaNZ> captain good
[3:06:26] <+Zyquux> is Decimate worth main decking? wouldn't Farron just generally be better?
[3:06:30] <+Re_Volta> farrons hard to deal with
[3:06:31] <+AmericanSkidd> end game finisher
[3:06:38] <munitalprats> Farron might be too heavy in this deck, who knows
[3:06:43] <restingbones> Only the cards who can level up are Champions
[3:06:57] <SegaWyte> here's a hypothetical deck by copying this and pressing the import button CEDAGAQDAEDQSAYBAIEAYDYDAEBSILRXAECAGCQBAIBAKAIEAIKAEAIBAISQCAIDGYAA
[3:07:03] <nechronia> Recalls also work
[3:07:07] <munitalprats> these are just the ones you own
[3:07:08] <munitalprats> reminder
[3:07:08] <restingbones> @munitalprats yeah, he is, but he is really cool tho
[3:07:08] <An_Armed_Bear> @restingbones Hey now, Exalted Poro
[3:07:11] <+Re_Volta> put the other spider in its pretty great
[3:07:13] <+InsufficientStats> hit "show unowned"
[3:07:14] <Crombells> should get a second arachnoid sentry in
[3:07:25] <munitalprats> These are only the cards you own, reminder
[3:07:34] <restingbones> @An_Armed_Bear , you got me there PrideLaugh
[3:07:38] <pennykettle_> why does Zed show up under recall
[3:07:46] <munitalprats> @pennykettle_ his champion spell
[3:07:49] <pennykettle_> ohh
[3:07:49] <waterstealer> you can just click the card multiple times
[3:07:50] <GingaNZ> his champ spell
[3:08:07] <93lobo> Gold borders are champions
[3:08:24] <+Abd0022> Zed isn't that good
[3:08:24] <Crombells> Zed is better than Darius in this deck in general
[3:08:31] <+nocturne_reverie> i'd recommend some more 1-cost cards
[3:08:40] <pennykettle_> you only get zed's recall if you have a zed on board and in hand
[3:08:40] <munitalprats> Reminder that these aren't all the cards that do this, these are just the ones you own
[3:08:50] <GingaNZ> half the cost
[3:08:52] <+Abd0022> @Crombells i think both are bad
[3:08:54] <+RenoDeGeneric> He'll figure out deck balance on his own
[3:08:57] <restingbones> It recommend some damage ability units, and some damage spell cards
[3:08:57] <Jaysky> Darius is 6'5"
[3:09:01] <+dasmause> this isnt teppen, you dont start at 5 mana
[3:09:02] <MyNameIsRasus> woolie will figure it out
[3:09:08] <Crombells> both are bad, but Zed is still better than most other cheap units
[3:09:13] <munitalprats> Fearsome requires 3 attack
[3:09:13] <waterstealer> fearsome
[3:09:14] <MyNameIsRasus> fearsome
[3:09:16] <restingbones> Darius isnt made for blocking
[3:09:22] <GingaNZ> stun don't block
[3:09:23] <Safarihat> tempo is super important in this game
[3:09:28] <+Zyquux> Zed's spell is a recall which helps levelling Yasuo, but Darius would be a good finisher. with a limited deck choice, you make do.
[3:09:33] <An_Armed_Bear> Darius is a Sol player he doesn't block
[3:09:34] <GingaNZ> also kill with swain
[3:09:38] <munitalprats> Damage
[3:09:41] <+MGSKomodoDragon> darius and zed are aggressive. you're usually on the attack with them
[3:09:45] <munitalprats> you definitely want cards that do damage too
[3:09:45] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:09:46] <GingaNZ> honestly it's all good
[3:09:49] <pennykettle_> Champion cards turn into their spells if you have dupes, so 1 Zed doesnt help your recall goal
[3:09:50] <Nikbottom> some day...
[3:10:12] <+Abd0022> try the new deck :(
[3:10:13] <munitalprats> you'll get more cards after the prologue so :)
[3:10:17] <+AmericanSkidd> 3 for 3?
[3:10:26] <dds333a> @nikbottom Some nights...
[3:10:30] <munitalprats> you got a swain dekc
[3:10:33] <pennykettle_> wait til you see Deep decks FeelsGoodMan
[3:10:33] <munitalprats> swain
[3:10:35] <munitalprats> Mages and Mechanics
[3:10:38] <MyNameIsRasus> mages and mechanics
[3:10:38] <+Abd0022> Swain
[3:10:38] <Lancaster_H> you could play the swain deck the prologue gave you to get a taste for it @WoolieVersus
[3:10:39] <+dasmause> mages and mechanics
[3:10:40] <restingbones> Mages and mechanics
[3:10:40] <Jaysky> Mages and Mechanics
[3:10:41] <Nikbottom> mages and mechanics
[3:10:46] <+Zyquux> any bets on how long until he runs into a gimmick deck?
[3:10:56] <OblivionSword1> mages and mechanics
[3:11:02] <+RenoDeGeneric> Every deck is a gimmick deck lol
[3:11:02] <munitalprats> it's a swain based deck
[3:11:06] <GingaNZ> you can fill out the rest with damage spells and cheap units for your created deck
[3:11:12] <Jaysky> They never had that deck when I started. Neat
[3:11:13] <restingbones> This will give you an idea of how to Swain
[3:11:15] <Crombells> this is a rush deck
[3:11:25] <pennykettle_> I don't think I like Piltover and Zaun
[3:11:29] <munitalprats> T E E M O
[3:11:35] <munitalprats> That is correct
[3:11:37] <pennykettle_> its Six!
[3:11:37] <93lobo> Vi or 6
[3:11:39] <+CrabStealer> Vi yeah
[3:11:40] <waterstealer> yes
[3:11:40] <Jaysky> @pennykettle_ They're super spell heavy
[3:11:40] <+Abd0022> Yep
[3:11:41] <GingaNZ> OH FUCK ITS TEEMO
[3:11:41] <+Zyquux> @renodegeneric true, but thinking dumb stuff like Unyielding Kegs or Tahm Kench
[3:11:41] <+AmericanSkidd> thats the punch vi
[3:11:42] <Qu1ckyyy> OH NO the DEVIL
[3:11:43] <restingbones> Yeah thats the punch girl
[3:11:43] <+Urgotfantasy> her
[3:11:44] <Jaysky> Punch girl
[3:11:44] <BlackermanZX> Teemo kolWESCI

[3:11:53] <Safarihat> DEATH TO TEEMO

[3:12:22] <waterstealer> yuuup
[3:12:24] <restingbones> Big Damage
[3:12:32] <Crombells> she builds up strength while she's in your hand
[3:12:33] <mrtanaka111> ball breaker
[3:12:41] <%madmanrambler> so basically she's good to have in hand at the start
[3:12:42] <munitalprats> It's a temporary buff that you can keep replaying
[3:12:42] <+Zyquux> Vi is one of the cards you want to get in your opening hand
[3:12:46] <sparked963> And +8
[3:12:56] <munitalprats> she gains attack in hand
[3:13:00] <MyNameIsRasus> she's basically a win con
[3:13:00] <Nikbottom> in hand
[3:13:02] <Crombells> only gotta play 8 cards, not that bad
[3:13:03] <+Abd0022> she buffs herself
[3:13:06] <Safarihat> keep her in your hand
[3:13:06] <MyNameIsRasus> she gains attack in hand
[3:13:09] <+AmericanSkidd> low cost cards and buffs make it faster
[3:13:11] <sparked963> Vi is so much fun
[3:13:12] <Safarihat> toss swain
[3:13:13] <restingbones> So yeah, you want to start with Vi in hand
[3:13:25] <+Abd0022> tap the board
[3:13:28] <munitalprats> They are cosmetic

[3:14:10] <munitalprats> B O O M E R
[3:14:13] <MyNameIsRasus> vi gained attack there
[3:14:32] <mrtanaka111> not worth it defending with him, you may lose 6 damage free
[3:14:42] <+AmericanSkidd> Pat would join up with Viktor in universe
[3:14:50] <MyNameIsRasus> that spell counts for 6 damage
[3:14:52] <+RenoDeGeneric> Noxian Fervor counts for 6 damage for Swain
[3:14:54] <munitalprats> he absolutely would join up with Viktor
[3:14:59] <MyNameIsRasus> for swain's level up
[3:15:01] <munitalprats> ided just attack honestly
[3:15:03] <Kalcom> just attack

[3:15:37] <restingbones> Gotta take damage to deal damage as they say
[3:15:41] <Crombells> there's always the option of passing and waiting for the enemy to play something
[3:15:45] <93lobo> attack with 1/1
[3:15:50] <solidoutlaw> attack with the 1 1
[3:15:52] <munitalprats> attack with 1/1 for swain level condition
[3:15:54] <GingaNZ> attack with 11
[3:15:59] <solidoutlaw> and hold onto the 2/3 to block
[3:16:04] <MyNameIsRasus> attack with 1/1 for swain level up
[3:16:07] <munitalprats> this is basically a burn deck
[3:16:21] <solidoutlaw> it's okay if he dies, you did 3 damage this turn

[3:17:20] <Jaysky> It can be. He's Mr. RNG
[3:17:20] <Nikbottom> boy howdy
[3:17:20] <+RenoDeGeneric> They stick to random cards in your deck, and when you draw them you take the damage
[3:17:21] <%madmanrambler> you have to draw them
[3:17:23] <Nekros4442> It's not just 10. It just doubles how many you have. It'll be at least 15
[3:17:24] <GingaNZ> murder that rat
[3:17:30] <OblivionSword1> that's 10 free damage
[3:17:31] <sparked963> The worst
[3:17:32] <MyNameIsRasus> No, he doubles the amount that's already there
[3:17:33] <Nikbottom> 15 x2 =30
[3:17:34] <restingbones> if there are 15 in your deck, he ADDS 15
[3:17:35] <munitalprats> FREE
[3:17:36] <+Zyquux> *Laughs in Lissandra*
[3:17:37] <munitalprats> YOU DRAW IT
[3:17:38] <munitalprats> AND IT HAPPENS
[3:17:39] <pennykettle_> it spends itself
[3:17:40] <+Abd0022> you draw it
[3:17:43] <waterstealer> its a trap
[3:17:43] <sparked963> Burn him
[3:17:43] <+TestAnon> you get damaged as you draw cards
[3:17:44] <93lobo> It happens when you draw

[3:17:46] <%madmanrambler> so they're traps, they stick to cards in your deck
[3:17:46] <waterstealer> it attaches to a card

[3:17:54] <$Rumbutt> you put damage onto their cards when they draw them
[3:17:55] <Crombells> he doesn't play them, they attach to cards in your deck so when you draw them you take the damage
[3:17:56] <Nikbottom> LUL
[3:17:56] <pelonsinvalle> its a trap on YOUR deck
[3:17:57] <pennykettle_> it attaches to a random card. the more cards you draw the higher the chance to take damage

[3:23:20] <Nikbottom> VI is tough
[3:23:23] <munitalprats> Vi has tough though
[3:23:24] <+RenoDeGeneric> Vi is tough so she takes -1 damage, she can block the 1 for free
[3:23:25] <munitalprats> so you can block the 1/1
[3:23:26] <93lobo> Vi in front of 1/1
[3:23:26] <urkleturtle> tough works always though
[3:23:26] <munitalprats> for free

[3:24:13] <93lobo> Elephant can't take damage from less than 4
[3:24:18] <+MGSKomodoDragon> if you cast Noxian fervor on the 3/1 you can kill teemo and level up swain faster
[3:24:27] <+goose_attack_almanac> Use your 2 Cost unit on Vi
[3:24:32] <+Zyquux> I want Woolie to go against a full shroom deck just to experience the nightmare

[3:26:14] <restingbones> Or Vi
[3:26:15] <solidoutlaw> vi is tough
[3:26:15] <MyNameIsRasus> vi is tough
[3:26:18] <waterstealer> yes
[3:26:19] <munitalprats> ALL SOURCES
[3:26:19] <93lobo> Elephant or Vi

[3:26:25] <restingbones> ALL damage
[3:26:35] <+goose_attack_almanac> Noxian fervor
[3:26:35] <restingbones> Tough is very nice
[3:26:35] <munitalprats> attack with swain first
[3:26:41] <munitalprats> attack
[3:26:42] <+Zyquux> Tough is great
[3:26:42] <solidoutlaw> ATTACK
[3:26:43] <93lobo> Attack
[3:26:44] <MyNameIsRasus> attack
[3:26:50] <GingaNZ> spell now
[3:26:51] <munitalprats> attack with swain first
[3:26:52] <waterstealer> KILL RAT
[3:26:52] <munitalprats> imo
[3:26:54] <%madmanrambler> phew, sweating when the mouse was hovering over end round
[3:26:56] <+temsik> ATTAAAAAAAAAACK
[3:26:58] <sinbad2058> attack with swain they cant block
[3:27:03] <munitalprats> Oh i'm thinking of leveled up swain lol
[3:27:03] <urkleturtle> all out
[3:27:05] <93lobo> Swain and Elephant
[3:27:05] <%madmanrambler> honestly attack with everybody
[3:27:08] <munitalprats> just swing with everyone
[3:27:08] <+goose_attack_almanac> Use the Noxian fervor to level up swain
[3:27:08] <%madmanrambler> very close to lethal
[3:27:11] <+nocturne_reverie> you can use that spell to kill the 2 power
[3:27:14] <Nekros4442> Just full swing
[3:27:16] <Dirtbagdisco> Destroy the RAT
[3:27:31] <restingbones> Might as well get the 3/1 in there
[3:27:36] <+AmericanSkidd> its free real estate
[3:27:37] <+Abd0022> use spell to level swain @WoolieVersus
[3:27:41] <munitalprats> just do it to the elephant
[3:27:41] <GingaNZ> do it
[3:27:45] <munitalprats> Elephant is beefy
[3:27:46] <+Zyquux> 6 damage for Swain level
[3:27:47] <MyNameIsRasus> that would level up swain
[3:27:47] <93lobo> The elephant wont take damage
[3:27:48] <GingaNZ> trust us
[3:27:48] <%madmanrambler> nah he's good
[3:27:48] <+Abd0022> you level swain up
[3:27:49] <+goose_attack_almanac> no doi it
[3:27:54] <+nocturne_reverie> it'd be 2 to VI
[3:27:55] <Lancaster_H> elephant doesnt take damage below 4 @WoolieVersus
[3:27:57] <restingbones> Yeah, but its fast, so wait
[3:28:00] <+temsik> yes you do, hurt your allies, its good
[3:28:01] <restingbones> Its Fast!
[3:28:02] <munitalprats> 3 to an ally
[3:28:03] <solidoutlaw> you can use it during combat
[3:28:03] <%madmanrambler> nah elephant would take damage
[3:28:05] <munitalprats> elephant
[3:28:05] <restingbones> Wait!
[3:28:06] <93lobo> Elephant wont take damage
[3:28:07] <urkleturtle> the elephant
[3:28:08] <waterstealer> elephant
[3:28:12] <+AmericanSkidd> its fine
[3:28:13] <+dasmause> @93lobo it will
[3:28:14] <restingbones> You can do this later!
[3:28:15] <%madmanrambler> elephant would 100% take damage
[3:28:16] <MyNameIsRasus> elephant will take damage
[3:28:20] <OblivionSword1> the elephant can take it
[3:28:21] <+Zyquux> you can do it while declaring attack so they don't have a chance to play another unit
[3:28:21] <Kalcom> elephant will take damage
[3:28:21] <munitalprats> look at the eye
[3:28:22] <solidoutlaw> you can target the nexus as well
[3:28:24] <%madmanrambler> enemies with 4 or less power
[3:28:24] <munitalprats> the elephant can take it anyway
[3:28:24] <+Abd0022> enimies
[3:28:25] <+nocturne_reverie> enemies, not spells
[3:28:27] <%madmanrambler> is a very particular wording
[3:28:27] <sinbad2058> no only enimys
[3:28:28] <%TomoeMoeGozen> HIT THE NEXUS
[3:28:28] <waterstealer> it will, but he doesnt take damage from other enemies
[3:28:28] <GingaNZ> its not, but that's good
[3:28:29] <+disgruntledgruntle> Declare attack first
[3:28:29] <+AmericanSkidd> it might but its beefy to take it
[3:28:34] <munitalprats> you want the elephant to take damage anyway
[3:28:37] <93lobo> oh no i don't play Noxius my b
[3:28:37] <munitalprats> so you can level up
[3:28:46] <+Zyquux> it will still take damage from spells, but it doesn't matter since all of them are 4 power anyway
[3:28:56] <+Abd0022> EZ Clap
[3:28:57] <+AmericanSkidd> now you win
[3:28:58] <munitalprats> when he hits the nexus he hits everything
[3:29:01] <BlackermanZX> crow man activated
[3:29:05] <Nikbottom> Swain has the best level up animation in the game, don't @ me
[3:29:08] <+disgruntledgruntle> Now swing w errthang
[3:29:08] <munitalprats> when he hits the nexus everything takes 3
[3:29:11] <+nocturne_reverie> Vi can taunt the rat
[3:29:11] <restingbones> And the AI still passes?
[3:29:12] <GingaNZ> swain first
[3:29:15] <SomeAsianDood> @Nikbottom counter argument TF
[3:29:22] <+AmericanSkidd> Bird Up
[3:29:22] <+Zyquux> strongest BACKROW unit so it won't matter in combat
[3:29:23] <Crombells> the Ai is out of units
[3:29:26] <+RenoDeGeneric> GG
[3:29:27] <solidoutlaw> attack with everyone
[3:29:34] <MyNameIsRasus> swain first always
[3:29:37] <+dasmause> why swain first?
[3:29:42] <Nekros4442> Non-combat Nexus dmg
[3:29:44] <munitalprats> Swain first
[3:29:46] <MyNameIsRasus> his nexus strike
[3:29:47] <munitalprats> this is fine here though
[3:29:50] <%Deft_Thought> Non-combat can mean spells as well
[3:29:51] <munitalprats> it's just good practice
[3:29:53] <restingbones> no, not if you want to kill
[3:29:56] <solidoutlaw> the stun is only for units NOT defending
[3:29:56] <+goose_attack_almanac> put swain first
[3:29:59] <sinbad2058> swain first
[3:30:02] <solidoutlaw> so teemo can still block
[3:30:02] <GingaNZ> it's for learning
[3:30:03] <MyNameIsRasus> read the nexus strike part of swain woolz
[3:30:07] <Kalcom> order doesn't matter
[3:30:11] <+Abd0022> Swain first he deals damage
[3:30:12] <%madmanrambler> order can matter
[3:30:14] <+Zyquux> @dasmause so he deals 3 damage to everything. Doesn't matter here, but other times it would matter
[3:30:14] <GingaNZ> yes
[3:30:15] <lord_sykos> the stun doesn't matter, everything will die
[3:30:16] <munitalprats> order can matter, it doesnt here
[3:30:19] <+Abd0022> Nexus Strike
[3:30:19] <sinbad2058> it only stuns enemy's out of combat
[3:30:19] <+nocturne_reverie> you can taunt the rat and put out all your damage dealers to wreck shop here
[3:30:22] <+goose_attack_almanac> Yes but Swain is already levelled up
[3:30:24] <MyNameIsRasus> read his nexus strike
[3:30:27] <solidoutlaw> if a unit is in combat, it doesn't matter
[3:30:28] <93lobo> It's none combat damage the effect wont activate
[3:30:37] <munitalprats> @solidoutlaw the nexus strike effect
[3:30:42] <+Abd0022> look at the second ability @WoolieVersus
[3:30:46] <+goose_attack_almanac> this will kill
[3:30:49] <93lobo> the stun at least
[3:30:50] <%madmanrambler> yeah the nexus strike would trigger and do some stuff, but it really doesn't change anything
[3:30:53] <restingbones> All out attack
[3:30:53] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:30:57] <munitalprats> it doesn't matter here, but the nexus strike does matter in other scenarios
[3:30:58] <+Abd0022> read the nexus strike effect @WoolieVersus
[3:31:00] <OblivionSword1> he will hit the nexus this turn
[3:31:02] <%madmanrambler> teemo is dying anyway to vi, and teemo would block vi
[3:31:07] <+Zyquux> Nexus Strike means hitting the enemy nexus so he will deal 3 to all enemies, potentially saving allies down the line or removing blockers for overwhelm
[3:31:09] <MyNameIsRasus> when he strikes the nexus
[3:31:11] <%madmanrambler> so nothing really changes here
[3:31:18] <munitalprats> no
[3:31:20] <munitalprats> when HE hits the nexus
[3:31:24] <munitalprats> he deals 3 to everything
[3:31:27] <lord_sykos> no it goes off when he hits the nexus
[3:31:28] <+AmericanSkidd> You win, its just deciding how you win
[3:31:28] <MyNameIsRasus> after HE attacks the nexus
[3:31:31] <GingaNZ> only him, that's why he's first
[3:31:32] <sinbad2058> noly when he hits
[3:31:34] <%TaifuDragon> He can stun/kill enemies before other damage resolves
[3:31:34] <%Deft_Thought> Each time Swain hits the nexus, his ability triggers
[3:31:35] <SomeAsianDood> after HE attacks the nexus
[3:31:35] <%Javaa01> You have to hit the nexus first with him, and then the effect happens
[3:31:36] <Kalcom> in fact if vi had one more damage he should attack after vi
[3:31:36] <+disgruntledgruntle> No
[3:31:39] <%TaifuDragon> as opposed to doing it last
[3:31:43] <+disgruntledgruntle> ONLY Swain
[3:31:48] <+Abd0022> @AmericanSkidd he's learning the deck
[3:31:50] <%madmanrambler> but in the future yes his nexuststrike will trigger after hitting and deal 3 to all enemies, meaning any enemy blockers take 3 damage, potentially killing them before they deal damage to your allies
[3:31:55] <munitalprats> If he had a board you would deal 3 to everything before they get their blocks off
[3:31:55] <+CaioSIC> Non-combat is the important part
[3:32:01] <GingaNZ> so in that case swain killed teemo
[3:32:03] <MyNameIsRasus> his nexus strike effect is really strong
[3:32:05] <user_naim> welp
[3:32:06] <user_naim> gg
[3:32:07] <%Javaa01> Swain has to be the one to initiate
[3:32:12] <%madmanrambler> oh that won't matter here
[3:32:13] <+Zyquux> Nexus strike effects will also trigger on overwhelm damage
[3:32:22] <Dirtbagdisco> Omni pest control
[3:32:23] <lord_sykos> its two different abilities
[3:32:24] <+RenoDeGeneric> It has to be outa combat damage. And no it happens automatically
[3:32:31] <sinbad2058> its wen you do damge at anytime like with spells
[3:32:32] <+goose_attack_almanac> If you use a skill or spell he does it automatically. He deosn't even need to attacka t all for that
[3:32:34] <munitalprats> he has to attack the nexus specifically for his nexus strike abilitiy
[3:32:34] <93lobo> No as long as none combat damage is done such as spells and skills
[3:32:35] <Crombells> it activates even if he isn't attacking at all
[3:32:38] <MyNameIsRasus> attacking the nexus doesn't trigger it, it's non combat damage
[3:32:39] <+nocturne_reverie> when the nexus takes non-combat damage (like with the abilities)
[3:32:41] <OblivionSword1> the text above that is when non combat damage happens to the nexus
[3:32:41] <+dasmause> has to be noncombat damage
[3:32:43] <sinbad2058> spells and skills
[3:32:44] <GingaNZ> two different abilitys
[3:32:45] <munitalprats> his stun passive works with any non combat damage to the nexus
[3:32:45] <+Zyquux> The first part is only for OUT of combat damage
[3:32:46] <waterstealer> NON COMBAT DAMAGE
[3:32:47] <+Tesselcraig> that's just a passive effect, as long as he's on the board, whenever the enemy nexus takes NON combat damage, his effect triggers.
[3:32:47] <BlackermanZX> nah its two different abilities
[3:32:48] <+goose_attack_almanac> It's Spells or skills
[3:32:48] <ofernando_lor> it's noncombat damage
[3:32:49] <munitalprats> its TWO different effects
[3:32:49] <+Abd0022> he stuns back row enemies for non combat damage his ability counts as non combat damage
[3:32:54] <Kalcom> non combat
[3:32:55] <SomeAsianDood> It activates when out of combat. Will not proc from fighting
[3:32:57] <%Deft_Thought> No. The first ability is for non-combat. Meaning if you use a spell on the nexus, Swain's passive will stun a backrow enemy
[3:32:59] <%madmanrambler> so his top ability, the stun ability, won't matter if you deal combat damage, and it won't matter for units that aren't in the backrow. say if they're blocking already
[3:33:08] <%TaifuDragon> Nexus strike is only self-affecting, so you put him first. His own nexus strike triggers stun, and that stun hits enemies that have not attacked yet. Put him at the end, and other enemies have already attacked BEFORE he triggers his own stun.
[3:33:09] <+disgruntledgruntle> The above ability only triggers for Non-Combat damage, like spells and abilitiesp
[3:33:11] <JazzyJulZ> non combat damage like spells and card effects
[3:33:12] <restingbones> Any time he is on the the board and non combat damage is dealt to the nexus, he stuns an enemy
[3:33:15] <kojanga> how he levels up is how he stuns @woolieversus
[3:33:35] <%madmanrambler> right
[3:33:38] <munitalprats> exactly
[3:33:39] <%Deft_Thought> His other ability, Nexus Strike, just means when Swain hits the nexus he triggers the AoE damage
[3:33:39] <lord_sykos> yes
[3:33:40] <%madmanrambler> exactly
[3:33:42] <Crombells> it's combat as well, it's anything that deals damage to the enemy nexus
[3:33:43] <GingaNZ> correct
[3:33:44] <BlackermanZX> correct
[3:33:48] <Nikbottom> thumbs up
[3:33:50] <+goose_attack_almanac> Swain going first is just so that his 2nd ability damages all enemies before they block your allies
[3:33:52] <+Zyquux> Ideally, you'll want to trigger the first effect before attacking so they don't have any blockers
[3:33:52] <SomeAsianDood> SeemsGood
[3:33:53] <MyNameIsRasus> exactly, because the second one deals 3 to everything
[3:33:57] <munitalprats> It's the replacement for the prologue
[3:34:00] <%madmanrambler> okay so this is a real cool bit where you get to decide which region you want to care about and level up to get their cards
[3:34:04] <MyNameIsRasus> select which cards you want
[3:34:08] <munitalprats> its dope

[3:38:04] <dds333a> See Lucien I'm also familiar with
[3:38:08] <munitalprats> save the mana
[3:38:12] <Kalcom> woolie will not understand scouts

[3:38:22] <dds333a> He was one of the first champs I ever saw
[3:38:22] <ofernando_lor> save
[3:38:22] <%madmanrambler> okay we going hard
[3:38:24] <+Zyquux> Fs in the chat for Quinn. Not even in the deck focused on scouts
[3:38:25] <+CrabStealer> Full Unga
[3:38:27] <munitalprats> guess we're going unga
[3:38:27] <Nekros4442> That was unnecessary
[3:38:28] <pennykettle_> SMOrc
[3:38:31] <MyNameIsRasus> damn we going in
[3:38:33] <Nekros4442> Unga as hell
[3:38:34] <+Zyquux> SMOrc
[3:38:34] <+Abd0022> Big Unga
[3:38:36] <Safarihat> we goin hard
[3:38:45] <sparked963> Lol
[3:38:45] <BackwardCap> sajamSol I do 5
[3:38:46] <OblivionSword1> it's easy 5 damage why not
[3:38:52] <SomeAsianDood> just smack em harder first SMOrc
[3:38:58] <ofernando_lor> SMOrc SMOrc
[3:39:04] <GingaNZ> pass
[3:39:11] <urkleturtle> just skip
[3:39:17] <Nekros4442> pass
[3:39:18] <munitalprats> @OblivionSword1 you basically just spend 2 mana to deal 3 to face but that card could have been spent saving something high priority like yasuo, or to win a trade
[3:39:18] <MyNameIsRasus> yeah, just pass
[3:39:57] <waterstealer> so this is gonna be the game he loses
[3:40:04] <Kalcom> waste of healing
[3:40:04] <sinbad2058> if you recal the mentor then you can buff twice
[3:40:05] <OblivionSword1> we'll see
[3:40:05] <+Zyquux> @waterstealer LUL
[3:40:35] <urkleturtle> yasou would've been a more proactive play. not a lot that can deal with a 4 power quick attacker on turn 4
[3:40:37] <+Zyquux> You'll understand when you see it
[3:40:38] <pennykettle_> if only scout units attack, they dont spend your attack token
[3:40:39] <Nekros4442> You'll see pretty soon
[3:40:41] <+KilogramHours> Scout users can attack before other ones.
[3:40:42] <+dasmause> scouts attack without expending attack token
[3:40:44] <munitalprats> you'll see very soon
[3:40:45] <MyNameIsRasus> i'd really recomend doing the challenges
[3:40:47] <%madmanrambler> basically you get your attack token back if only scout units attacked
[3:40:47] <+Abd0022> if only scout units attack he can attack twice
[3:40:49] <GingaNZ> attack
[3:40:50] <+goose_attack_almanac> Scout units get an extra attack phase from the token
[3:40:52] <Crombells> scouts get to attack once without using the attack token if you only attack with scouts
[3:40:53] <Kalcom> scouts attack 2 times
[3:40:54] <munitalprats> ??
[3:40:58] <waterstealer> ?????????????
[3:41:05] <munitalprats> well you didnt need the lifesteal anyway
[3:41:08] <+Zyquux> @pennykettle_ technically you get a new one. it's a small difference that does matter for units like Riven
[3:41:14] <93lobo> 5 cost
[3:41:17] <GingaNZ> sneak
[3:41:19] <93lobo> 5 cost unit
[3:41:21] <93lobo> sneak
[3:41:23] <munitalprats> sneaky zeebles
[3:41:24] <%madmanrambler> yo that zeeber though
[3:41:25] <munitalprats> is SO good here
[3:41:28] <waterstealer> ZEEBLES
[3:41:31] <+Abd0022> yasuo first
[3:41:31] <+Zyquux> Zeebs time to shine
[3:41:32] <urkleturtle> play yasou, set up for the big stun next turn
[3:41:33] <+disgruntledgruntle> ZEEBLES

[3:41:46] <MyNameIsRasus> leveled up yasuo free
[3:41:54] <Nekros4442> Yasuo levelled
[3:41:55] <%madmanrambler> zeebles did his thing
[3:41:55] <BlackermanZX> monkaS
[3:41:59] <+Zyquux> I'd be mad if I was that guy lol
[3:42:00] <+AmericanSkidd> oh he desperate
[3:42:00] <munitalprats> zeebles stunned everything
[3:42:01] <+KilogramHours> You stunned everyone and Yasuo leveled up
[3:42:18] <+disgruntledgruntle> That was kind hot
[3:42:19] <MyNameIsRasus> yasuo and will of ionia any problems away
[3:42:25] <ofernando_lor> recall the stun bird
[3:42:29] <mrtanaka111> recall gerbilss and kill everything with yasuo
[3:42:29] <munitalprats> yasuo is so easy here
[3:42:34] <+KilogramHours> Play Yasuo
[3:42:40] <Kalcom> yas

[3:42:57] <BlackermanZX> oh damn
[3:42:58] <%Javaa01> Pull the bird out for another mass stun down the line
[3:42:59] <mrtanaka111> woolie will figure it out
[3:42:59] <munitalprats> it's okay
[3:43:00] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Riot game WutFace
[3:43:03] <+disgruntledgruntle> Play yas then Navori zeebles
[3:43:04] <+xpakeo> guys let him play, let him learn
[3:43:05] <OblivionSword1> It's fine
[3:43:07] <+Zyquux> got lost in the sauce
[3:43:11] <MyNameIsRasus> oof
[3:43:12] <93lobo> If you use conspiritor to bring back sneak then you Yassuo can clean them up
[3:43:17] <OblivionSword1> GUN
[3:43:25] <+Zyquux> I CAST GUN
[3:43:36] <waterstealer> ATAAAAACK
[3:43:36] <pennykettle_> let him lose, it's good for building character Kappa
[3:43:39] <%Deft_Thought> I hear Liam O'Brian
[3:43:42] <%madmanrambler> will is a nice bail out problem
[3:43:42] <+nocturne_reverie> is that Liam!>
[3:43:46] <waterstealer> thats because it is
[3:43:46] <+Zyquux> oh shit he's baiting for Lucian level lol
[3:43:47] <SomeAsianDood> yasuo is voice by liam yup
[3:43:50] <munitalprats> you could have navori'd instead of the shieldbearer
[3:43:53] <+Abd0022> attacc
[3:43:54] <+goose_attack_almanac> Gaara if the wins
[3:43:54] <+AmericanSkidd> Its Akihiko
[3:43:55] <munitalprats> and had zeebles for next turn
[3:43:55] <OblivionSword1> it is indeed liam o brien
[3:43:57] <MyNameIsRasus> he can recall zeeble next turn, he won't attack with the challenger first because he wants scout
[3:44:02] <%madmanrambler> zeebles is safe to attack this turn
[3:44:03] <thecityofruin> dagger dagger dagger liam?
[3:44:04] <+nial_evol> make them trade
[3:44:07] <+Zyquux> no reason not to attack
[3:44:09] <+Abd0022> yasuo has quick attack
[3:44:09] <93lobo> Attack with elusive
[3:44:11] <Kalcom> he can't recall zeeble if it dies
[3:44:11] <mrtanaka111> careful with spells woolie
[3:44:12] <waterstealer> does this deck run sharpsight?
[3:44:15] <Nekros4442> He's Elusive Woolie
[3:44:16] <%madmanrambler> zeebles is elusive
[3:44:16] <+nial_evol> elusive can't be blockeed
[3:44:17] <+Abd0022> elusive
[3:44:17] <GingaNZ> elusive
[3:44:18] <%madmanrambler> can't be blocked
[3:44:19] <93lobo> They can't block it
[3:44:20] <MyNameIsRasus> he's elusive so he won't
[3:44:20] <%madmanrambler> nice
[3:44:24] <OblivionSword1> zeebele is elusive
[3:44:31] <+disgruntledgruntle> Idk if this deck has sharpsight or not
[3:44:31] <mrtanaka111> dont need to block it to kill it
[3:44:32] <Deasmeister> @thecityofruin yep
[3:44:38] <waterstealer> i'd imagine not
[3:44:41] <SomeAsianDood> deck should run sharpsight but he needs to learn
[3:44:50] <+Abd0022> Lucian leveld
[3:44:52] <pennykettle_> its a prebuilt deck
[3:44:52] <+Zyquux> I feel like the prebuilt deck doesn't have sharpsight, but it should definitely be added
[3:44:54] <KingSpunf> cards
[3:45:03] <waterstealer> oh no

[3:50:53] <+Zyquux> best play would've been to play the 1 drop to bait out more units
[3:50:55] <+dasmause> ah the infinite earsplitter
[3:50:59] <MyNameIsRasus> oh this guy's fucked
[3:51:01] <+TestAnon> he Timmy'd too hard

[3:51:03] <MyNameIsRasus> just swing
[3:51:05] <Safarihat> dial up dragon
[3:51:05] <munitalprats> i would have attacked with yasuo first because he had no answers, and then played mindsplitter after he played a card

[3:51:35] <93lobo> nope
[3:51:46] <+KilogramHours> Thats not what quick attack does
[3:51:51] <waterstealer> rip yas
[3:51:56] <Crombells> @urkleturtle because the volume on Woolie's game is really high
[3:52:01] <waterstealer> oof
[3:52:02] <+goose_attack_almanac> read Dragon
[3:52:03] <%Javaa01> Yes, blocking is a mechanic
[3:52:03] <Nekros4442> He didnt block Yasuo

[3:52:28] <munitalprats> next turn
[3:52:28] <GingaNZ> lol top deck
[3:52:33] <mrtanaka111> no you wont
[3:52:33] <Nekros4442> ah hell
[3:52:33] <MyNameIsRasus> just drop leona
[3:52:35] <+PMAvers> Leona is here to Eff There Stuff Up.
[3:52:35] <waterstealer> STUUUUUN
[3:52:36] <93lobo> Leo
[3:52:38] <+Abd0022> Leona
[3:52:39] <+Zyquux> best top deck lmao
[3:52:39] <%d1stantutopia> L E O N A
[3:52:39] <munitalprats> easy stun lytKEK
[3:52:40] <+KilogramHours> LEONA
[3:52:44] <93lobo> Leona
[3:52:46] <MyNameIsRasus> the unit you chose died
[3:52:46] <Nekros4442> Oh Leona
[3:52:46] <user_naim> man who saw this coming
[3:52:48] <munitalprats> L E O N A
[3:52:53] <+Zyquux> Mindsplitter won't stun because his target is dead
[3:52:53] <MyNameIsRasus> leona easy
[3:52:56] <OblivionSword1> leona will stun it
[3:53:01] <%madmanrambler> so when you play the mindsplitter, you pick 2 enemies. at roundstart you stun the 2 enemies you picked
[3:53:02] <93lobo> you misunderstood that dragons ability you'll get used to it
[3:53:07] <+AmericanSkidd> sur incoming?
[3:53:09] <urkleturtle> it only stuns the units you picked when you play him
[3:53:09] <+xerotwo> PRAISE THE SUN
[3:53:22] <%d1stantutopia> \]I[/
[3:53:24] <%madmanrambler> so you don't have the attack token
[3:53:29] <munitalprats> end round or devlop
[3:53:29] <+Zyquux> Mindsplitter is such a weird card to understand
[3:53:30] <%madmanrambler> you could
[3:53:32] <munitalprats> you could
[3:53:33] <Nekros4442> nah just end round
[3:53:34] <%madmanrambler> or you could just end the round
[3:53:36] <+KilogramHours> just end
[3:53:36] <93lobo> get the old man out if you want
[3:53:36] <+goose_attack_almanac> \{i]/
[3:53:37] <%d1stantutopia> \[I]/
[3:53:37] <munitalprats> just don't play morning light untill next turn
[3:53:39] <MyNameIsRasus> you still don't have lethal here,
[3:53:42] <pennykettle_> you could but why dump the load
[3:53:51] <+KilogramHours> ATTACK
[3:53:51] <waterstealer> PLAY FORGER
[3:53:57] <dds333a> \[I]/
[3:54:02] <%d1stantutopia> Morning Light -> attack for win
[3:54:02] <Crombells> morning light will stun 2, so play something else first
[3:54:03] <%TomoeMoeGozen> use the slow then just attack, you win
[3:54:04] <93lobo> 5 cost spell
[3:54:09] <93lobo> Morning Light
[3:54:12] <waterstealer> FORGER
[3:54:12] <munitalprats> just play sunforger
[3:54:13] <+goose_attack_almanac> forger
[3:54:14] <munitalprats> and you win
[3:54:18] <GingaNZ> 4 cost
[3:54:20] <MyNameIsRasus> play sunforger
[3:54:21] <+goose_attack_almanac> 4 cost
[3:54:22] <%madmanrambler> either of the daybreak cards probably wins it
[3:54:30] <MyNameIsRasus> or morning light
[3:54:31] <Crombells> wait, no, it won't stun unless it's the first played
[3:54:33] <SomeAsianDood> either procs the stun, could buff after
[3:54:33] <MyNameIsRasus> you win either way
[3:54:37] <munitalprats> Sunforger
[3:54:38] <+Zyquux> ideally, you'd save morning light to stun two units
[3:54:38] <sinbad2058> it will stun the dragon
[3:54:40] <93lobo> Leona will stun the Dragon
[3:54:40] <munitalprats> this works too
[3:54:41] <+KilogramHours> Morning LIght stuns the 6/6 right?
[3:54:44] <+goose_attack_almanac> 4 cost please
[3:54:45] <munitalprats> but stunforger would have been better
[3:54:47] <waterstealer> it does
[3:54:48] <waterstealer> twice
[3:54:53] <+goose_attack_almanac> ahhhh inefficent
[3:54:54] <munitalprats> because morning light is 2 stuns
[3:54:56] <OblivionSword1> this can still work
[3:54:56] <munitalprats> and Sunforger is 1
[3:54:59] <waterstealer> but now he plays any unit
[3:55:01] <munitalprats> this still works though
[3:55:03] <%TomoeMoeGozen> winner winner chinken dinner
[3:55:03] <waterstealer> and loses value
[3:55:10] <waterstealer> yeah he can
[3:55:15] <waterstealer> leo only has 6 attack
[3:55:18] <Safarihat> morning light + leona is only 2 stuns if morning light is daybroken
[3:55:19] <%madmanrambler> he could play another unit after your card resolves
[3:55:22] <%madmanrambler> but this will stun leona
[3:55:23] <+AmericanSkidd> YES
[3:55:23] <waterstealer> ok then
[3:55:25] <%madmanrambler> yeah there you go!
[3:55:26] <waterstealer> sure

[3:55:51] <+KilogramHours> Woolie go to challenges
[3:55:52] <+Evendrag> ooh shit we are touching league today
[3:55:53] <Nekros4442> Scouts attack before the army, then the army attacks @WoolieVersus
[3:55:53] <+KilogramHours> PLAY CHALLENGES
[3:55:53] <Crombells> scout lets you attack once without consuming the token, if you only attack with scouts
[3:55:54] <%madmanrambler> might be worth booting that one up
[3:55:54] <sparked963> Nice
[3:55:55] <munitalprats> 300% WINRATE
[3:55:55] <user_naim> You look huge
[3:55:55] <+AmericanSkidd> I WAS HERE
[3:55:55] <GingaNZ> scouts get a free attack
[3:55:58] <pelonsinvalle> do the scout tutorial
[3:56:00] <dds333a> Champion, Baby!
[3:56:02] <+PMAvers> Basically if your first attack is with all Scouts, you get the attack token back.
[3:56:02] <sinbad2058> it is one free attack for the scout units
[3:56:02] <Safarihat> there is a scout tutorial
[3:56:03] <+KilogramHours> Do Scout tutorial
[3:56:04] <%TaifuDragon> @WoolieVersus Scout is easy. When 'scouts' attack, as long as no non-scouts attack, the enemy gets a free second attack turn
[3:56:05] <waterstealer> do more tutorials
[3:56:06] <mrtanaka111> you got a new champ
[3:56:07] <CrackerJack450> basically if he attacks with only scout units he can attack again
[3:56:08] <waterstealer> challenges
[3:56:08] <+KilogramHours> DO TUTORIALS
[3:56:09] <Kalcom> do tutorial
[3:56:11] <MyNameIsRasus> there is a tutorial for every keyword
[3:56:14] <+TestAnon> scouts can essentially attack twice in a round. @woolieversus
[3:56:15] <93lobo> All W's today
[3:56:18] <+Zyquux> Scout: If you attack with only units that have scout, you get the attack token again so you can attack twice. This only happens once per turn.
[3:56:19] <BlackermanZX> unlike in normal games in league
[3:56:29] <munitalprats> yes

[3:56:39] <GingaNZ> do the tutorial for scouts
[3:56:40] <Deasmeister> yes
[3:56:41] <%d1stantutopia> @WoolieVersus The enemy gets 2 attacks as long as the first attack is only scouts
[3:56:42] <SomeAsianDood> Yes
[3:56:42] <%Javaa01> Scouts are your first line of attackers
[3:56:43] <+nocturne_reverie> scouts get VIP access to kicking your shit in
[3:56:45] <munitalprats> you can defend with anything
[3:56:47] <Crombells> you can defend with anything
[3:56:47] <%TaifuDragon> It only affects attacks

[3:56:51] <93lobo> You can defend with any units
[3:56:52] <+xpakeo> @WoolieVersus if you go to play then challenges they are pretty much tutorials
[3:56:53] <+KilogramHours> You can defend with anything
[3:56:53] <Nikbottom> defending is normal
[3:56:54] <+Zyquux> you can defend with anything as normal
[3:56:55] <MyNameIsRasus> you can defend with anything, it's just an attack
[3:57:09] <thecityofruin> the VIPness

[3:58:29] <pelonsinvalle> it's stupid
[3:58:31] <Nikbottom> this is the most extra guy
[3:58:32] <waterstealer> dont worry about it
[3:58:40] <SomeAsianDood> He's new he's gonna be busy
[3:58:41] <+Zyquux> Who's more complicated: Akshan or Aphelios?
[3:58:43] <waterstealer> this is too much for a newbie dude
[3:58:43] <pelonsinvalle> IGNORE
[3:58:46] <BlackermanZX> Hes an entire yugioh deck in one huh
[3:58:50] <GingaNZ> the most complex

[3:59:26] <+AmericanSkidd> Can you spell Power Creep?
[3:59:27] <+Zyquux> The chad deck is Howling Abyss, Siphoning Strike, Akshan
[3:59:30] <Nikbottom> NotLikeThis
[3:59:31] <+goose_attack_almanac> Akshan bothers me because he's always paired with Riven and their turns never end
[3:59:35] <ofernando_lor> It's an advanced card

[4:00:24] <+nocturne_reverie> when you place it, get it to 0 as quick as possible, he summons a timer, if he already summoned it, it goes down another number

[4:02:47] <+Gstrawhatyoshi> how did Woolie learn about Runeterra @chat
[4:02:50] <YuDanCha> yeah this is kind of why I fell off this game
[4:02:51] <%madmanrambler> mind you this is easily the most complicated card in the game
[4:02:52] <pelonsinvalle> *this guy*
[4:02:52] <macmens> not even that good if you can believe it
[4:02:52] <Drizzydre116> This is a very complicated, yet uncomplicated, champion
[4:02:54] <%madmanrambler> but yeah
[4:02:54] <OblivionSword1> he is the only one that's like this
[4:02:57] <pennykettle_> @Gstrawhatyoshi pat
[4:02:59] <Nikbottom> @munitalprats what about aphelios
[4:02:59] <pelonsinvalle> just this guy

[4:03:03] <emptyantics> RUNETERRA LADIES AND GENTS

[4:03:05] <mrtanaka111> no chat,its no
[4:03:05] <Crombells> this game doesn't have powercreep, it has textcreep

[4:03:06] <93lobo> kinda
[4:03:06] <%TaifuDragon> Simpler is stronger
[4:03:06] <GingaNZ> nah there are 2 of them
[4:03:07] <%TomoeMoeGozen> nah its just him
[4:03:08] <munitalprats> @munitalprats Aphelios isnt NEARLY as bad
[4:03:08] <dds333a> It can go FURTHER
[4:03:08] <+AmericanSkidd> Maybe stick with sword guy for now
[4:03:09] <waterstealer> YUP
[4:03:10] <+TestAnon> nah there's plenty of unga decks

[4:03:16] <+xpakeo> literally just him and aphelios
[4:03:16] <pennykettle_> its not this bad but it does get more complicated
[4:03:16] <+Zyquux> Yeah pretty much. This is what happens when you join a card game a year late
[4:03:16] <93lobo> Yep
[4:03:17] <Hammatime8> That sure is Runeterra
[4:03:18] <%Exiliator> I mean... Have you seen modern Yu-gi-oh?
[4:03:20] <Drizzydre116> nah just him for the most part
[4:03:21] <+EinTheBusinessDeer> He's literally the only one who does that
[4:03:21] <GingaNZ> only 2 of them
[4:03:23] <Safarihat> nah its kinda just him
[4:03:23] <pelonsinvalle> it's only ONE guy
[4:03:24] <emptyantics> Literally just him
[4:03:28] <+nocturne_reverie> proc after proc
[4:03:29] <Deasmeister> I heard you like keywords with your keywords
[4:03:31] <+Abd0022> look at Azir @WoolieVersus he replaces your deck
[4:03:32] <%Javaa01> Yes, this is perfectly representative of League characters in the actual game as well over the years
[4:03:36] <waterstealer> yeah he's pretty bullshit
[4:03:38] <pennykettle_> some champions do literally delete your deck and give you their custom deck with OP cards
[4:03:39] <+AmericanSkidd> Look at Aurelion Sol for a real laugh
[4:03:39] <+patel347> now read the other new guy for comparison
[4:03:40] <mrtanaka111> he looks worse than he is woolie
[4:03:41] <+goose_attack_almanac> I hate Akshan because his turns take forever
[4:03:42] <mrtanaka111> its fine
[4:03:44] <+Zyquux> Tbh, in practice, he's not that hard
[4:03:49] <Dirtbagdisco> In this behemoth typhoon
[4:03:51] <MyNameIsRasus> He's not that bad honestly
[4:03:54] <munitalprats> NOPE

[4:03:58] <+Abd0022> Nope
[4:03:58] <%madmanrambler> he's actually not that bad
[4:03:59] <Crombells> Viego is simple
[4:04:00] <MyNameIsRasus> No
[4:04:00] <BackwardCap> @woolieversus Azir is a champion actually replace your deck with a new one for his level up.
[4:04:01] <Jaysky> @WoolieVersus If you want to have a panic attack look up Aphelios too
[4:04:01] <+Abd0022> he's UNGA
[4:04:01] <+CrabStealer> Nah
[4:04:01] <+xpakeo> nah
[4:04:01] <GingaNZ> nah
[4:04:01] <waterstealer> nope

[4:04:08] <%madmanrambler> he's just 'things die
[4:04:09] <SomeAsianDood> Nope
[4:04:09] <waterstealer> viego is actually pretty simple
[4:04:09] <+TestAnon> he's more simple but more bullshit
[4:04:09] <munitalprats> VIEGO
[4:04:11] <pelonsinvalle> viego is just buffs
[4:04:12] <MyNameIsRasus> Viego

[4:04:23] <Lancaster_H> viego ungas
[4:04:25] <+Zyquux> Someone show him the Shurmia level up movie LUL
[4:04:26] <Lancaster_H> sometimes he bungas
[4:04:27] <+PMAvers> I mean, Aphelios is easy, he's just style switchingn.
[4:04:29] <MyNameIsRasus> show unowed
[4:04:29] <kojanga> air LITTERALY gains a new deck when you in a card match @woolieversus
[4:04:36] <SomeAsianDood> Aphelios @pennykettle_

[4:04:45] <kojanga> azir @woolieversus
[4:04:46] <+nocturne_reverie> honestly, it looks like all of his effects are automatic besides choices
[4:04:46] <mrtanaka111> read lore

[4:05:15] <%madmanrambler> yeah he's real cool
[4:05:16] <dds333a> nani
[4:05:18] <+RaveBV> "everywhere" means deck too, doesn't it?
[4:05:19] <+AmericanSkidd> He's so good
[4:05:19] <waterstealer> yeah he's pretty good

[4:05:23] <munitalprats> he's VERY GOOD
[4:05:24] <GingaNZ> very late game
[4:05:25] <+RaveBV> dude, he sounds broken
[4:05:26] <emptyantics> Viego is like Vergil, except with a harem and 10000%x’s edgier
[4:05:26] <munitalprats> PROBLEMATIC
[4:05:28] <+bigcomfyman> don't worry, Akshan is just as complicated in the normal game as he is here
[4:05:29] <%madmanrambler> akshan is exciting if you love how complex cards can get, viego is fun if you want to feel real strong
[4:05:31] <+patel347> hes strong but easy to kill
[4:05:34] <+Zyquux> @nocturne_reverie yeah, Akshan is way easier than it sounds. It's basically just make a choice every few rounds
[4:05:36] <Nikbottom> that is a big problem
[4:05:36] <SomeAsianDood> He's alot of fun. Kinda slow to ramp though
[4:05:37] <%madmanrambler> its timmys versus johnnys
[4:05:40] <+Abd0022> very hard to level @WoolieVersus
[4:05:41] <waterstealer> hes super good
[4:05:43] <+EinTheBusinessDeer> it's a free "kill this problem" button
[4:05:45] <Kalcom> he's super strong if he gets there
[4:05:46] <emptyantics> He’a fucking good
[4:05:46] <munitalprats> he's very hard to level though
[4:05:47] <MyNameIsRasus> very hard to level up
[4:05:48] <munitalprats> LOOK UP APHELIOS
[4:05:56] <+AmericanSkidd> Now you work for Veigo
[4:05:58] <kojanga> check out azir @woolieversus
[4:06:03] <waterstealer> NO
[4:06:04] <pelonsinvalle> no, not aphelios

[4:06:32] <kojanga> azir
[4:06:34] <MyNameIsRasus> APHELIOS IS SO BAD THO
[4:06:35] <+Zyquux> Aphelios is way harder to play than Akshan
[4:06:36] <Onatamana> I see Aphelios is faithful to his LoL version
[4:06:36] <munitalprats> HE'S HORRIBLE
[4:06:37] <pennykettle_> LUL TRUE
[4:06:39] <%madmanrambler> thankfully aphelios got nerfed into dust so you don't have to worry about learning what he does in gunslinger
[4:06:40] <+EinTheBusinessDeer> he's turbo trash
[4:06:43] <pelonsinvalle> he's so weak tho
[4:06:43] <Safarihat> aphelios is bad so your fine
[4:06:44] <waterstealer> HES TRASH RIGHT NOW
[4:06:44] <Lancaster_H> it is pretty accurate though
[4:06:45] <Nikbottom> He's bad now
[4:06:46] <dds333a> Hahaha
[4:06:47] <+Zyquux> Remember when his guns were 2 mana?

[4:08:14] <dds333a> @nechronia NA
[4:08:16] <%Lion_kun> Pat would kick your ass lol
[4:08:19] <%Exiliator> Send Woolie all your deck-picks Kappa
[4:08:26] <+AmericanSkidd> You heard him Chat
[4:08:27] <Jaysky> You could ask Pat if he'd let you on his account to test shit
[4:08:33] <Lancaster_H> my deck is warm, lets go
[4:08:34] <+goose_attack_almanac> @Lion_kun pat has cardsa and months of experience though
[4:08:36] <pennykettle_> Pat will not give his login LUL
[4:08:39] <MyNameIsRasus> good shit woolz
[4:08:42] <+Zyquux> pour one out for my unyielding kench deck
[4:08:48] <GingaNZ> mad good
[4:08:49] <Crombells> you did good, son
[4:08:49] <SomeAsianDood> I'm pretty sure you can ask pat to loan decks if you challenge him in pvp
[4:08:49] <primaryfire> got him
[4:09:06] <MyNameIsRasus> it's real good
[4:09:07] <Jaysky> Translators Notes: I'm still playing Teppen.
[4:09:08] <+patel347> I think you would like pyke
[4:09:09] <+goose_attack_almanac> OH THERES SOME BULLSHUT
[4:09:13] <%Exiliator> Woolie score out of 10?
[4:09:13] <GingaNZ> there is some bullshit, it's great
[4:09:14] <MyNameIsRasus> Pyke is ridiculous
[4:09:21] <+nocturne_reverie> this man really walked into the bracket, beat the tutorial and called himself the undefeated champ; brought his own belt and everything
[4:09:21] <+patel347> pyke is super fun
[4:09:21] <BlackermanZX> nasus is my boy
[4:09:23] <dds333a> Right
[4:09:25] <+Waage83> Pyke is a jerk and i hate him
[4:09:28] <+goose_attack_almanac> There is straight up a spell that just makes a card invincible permanently
[4:09:28] <SomeAsianDood> PYke Reksai aggro is so much fun
[4:09:30] <Jaysky> Irelia/Azir
[4:09:31] <Kalcom> what was your deck in teppen
[4:09:32] <+Zyquux> Pyke is super flashy. Like Yasuo but more
[4:09:33] <+AmericanSkidd> There are no wrong answers
[4:09:34] <emptyantics> Deep Decks are rough but so much damn fun
[4:09:36] <Safarihat> there is a giant space dragon
[4:09:55] <+patel347> yeah
[4:10:00] <BlackermanZX> this is a bit more chill than teppen
[4:10:02] <happy_void> theory crafting is half the fun
[4:10:14] <GingaNZ> yeah it's real complex compaired to normal
[4:10:15] <MyNameIsRasus> it's the real meat of the game, that and the spell mana
[4:10:18] <+Waage83> Yeah a lot of it is turning fights around with a flash or burst card
[4:10:22] <BackwardCap> gildedSalute

[4:24:50] <Shad0wTag> *me
[4:25:04] <user_naim> I’m doing so many fucking sit ups to prepare

[4:26:44] <%CaptainPileDriver> if i can throw an item, i'll do it
[4:27:04] <Shad0wTag> the life of a faust main
[4:27:13] <%CaptainPileDriver> yo @WoolieVersus there's not many people tonight tbh so if you want you could do first to 2
[4:27:19] <%Irridium> yeah I've been playing on PC I swear I'm better than this LUL
[4:27:24] <%Afterman_> those colors are sexy
[4:27:40] <BlackermanZX> neon faust looks sick
[4:27:48] <Shad0wTag> There is only 9 of us damn
[4:27:51] <%Afterman_> I wish we got some DLC that lets people make custom colors for characters, Id pay 5 bucks for that
[4:28:09] <Dante_Namikaze1> @shad0wtag I'm about to be there too
[4:28:23] <user_naim> good luck @shad0wtag btw
[4:29:01] <Shad0wTag> Thanks dude it'll be my second time facing Woolie except now he's really good at the Pot match up
[4:29:01] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:29:16] <%CaptainPileDriver> god forbid they buff faust
[4:29:23] <Shad0wTag> But @captainpiledriver is right there is so few of us
[4:29:36] <%Helix_Snake> Helix_Snake subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! aw I missed the faust match
[4:29:51] <%Helix_Snake> I play Faust
[4:29:57] <Thunderhog> It wasn't exactly a wake up super. Just used to seeing the commandgrab there and just did it
[4:30:13] <%CaptainPileDriver> yeah, you get in a faust's face, we're kinda fucked
[4:31:12] <%Waage83> as long as it works
[4:31:14] <+girardluke> i've been having a lot of issues with Nago vs Pot lately, though i only just picked up Nago so maybe it gets easier
[4:31:17] <%Helix_Snake> I've seen a wide variety of opinions on the "third worst" character, it is almost universal that the bottom two are Anji and Faust, but for the "third worst" I've seen Ky, Millia, Pot, Nago, all kinds of characters, who do you think is "third worst"?
[4:31:23] <Shad0wTag> aaaah I panicked
[4:31:32] <user_naim> i love the rival avatar @shad0wtag
[4:31:52] <%CaptainPileDriver> oh i know
[4:31:54] <CheyMix> saying nago is 3rd worst is cap
[4:32:01] <%CaptainPileDriver> i've done some stupid shit and won and knew i didn't deserve it
[4:32:07] <%Waage83> yeah
[4:32:15] <Blaven2> My Faust wacky desperation move is to teleport RC and then grab.
[4:32:24] <Shad0wTag> @user_naim Absolutely not on purpose I just love white suits in irl as I have my own
[4:32:32] <%CaptainPileDriver> like getting 3 meteors in a row
[4:32:38] <%Waage83> yeah
[4:32:53] <Shad0wTag> I'd be more inclined Ky is closer to bottom 3 than Millia
[4:32:59] <Dante_Namikaze1> wait there was a point couldn't even see the station?
[4:33:01] <%CaptainPileDriver> i really hate dirty stations are only half dirty on the other players side
[4:33:07] <Blaven2> Oh, man. I was doing some locals matches with a friend when we were both still learning and got three bombs in a row, he was terrified to move or press buttons.
[4:33:12] <%Helix_Snake> @Shad0wTag yeah this seems right to me
[4:33:18] <Shad0wTag> @dante_namikaze1 First beta had no stations
[4:33:19] <%CaptainPileDriver> @Dante_Namikaze1 yes, in the beta
[4:33:24] <CheyMix> idk kys can be scary
[4:33:33] <%Helix_Snake> I am not the most knowledgable but Ky being the bottom 3rd is very believable
[4:33:33] <CheyMix> but maybe
[4:33:37] <%Helix_Snake> his neutral tho
[4:34:10] <CheyMix> I saw a ky max fought last night. he's a great example of a good ky
[4:34:26] <Shad0wTag> Ky is easy to learn but requires good game sense and spacing but Millia is absolutely not bad enough to be next to Anji or Faust
[4:34:57] <%CaptainPileDriver> now ram is a character i always feel i get robbed when fighting
[4:35:15] <Shad0wTag> Ram gets so much reward and so little risk
[4:35:29] <%Waage83> yeah
[4:35:32] <Shad0wTag> And she has an amazing wake up super
[4:35:57] <Shad0wTag> Like if not for May or Sol, Ram would be top
[4:35:57] <%Irridium> fun fact Goldlewis' 5P whiffs on Giovanna when she's literally just standing there
[4:36:10] <%CaptainPileDriver> granted anytime a ram does the laser super i love flying over it as a faust and just getting a full combo
[4:36:11] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:36:33] <+Rekinsinn> oh, does this game buffer input during super freeze or do you need to time it when freeze ends?
[4:36:54] <Shad0wTag> I don't mean the beam super I mean the sword super
[4:36:54] <+Dova573> how big is the line?
[4:37:01] <%CaptainPileDriver> @Shad0wTag oh i know
[4:37:14] <Thunderhog> 9 other people currently @Dova573
[4:37:16] <Shad0wTag> There's 10 of us @dova573
[4:37:17] <fugly_nick> Close match
[4:37:19] <%CaptainPileDriver> @Dova573 not as big as it usually is
[4:37:24] <user_naim> damn, sorry for the lag
[4:37:32] <D3va> this game is awesome, i
[4:37:47] <%Irridium> Line's only like 10 people long lo
[4:37:56] <D3va> i am garbage tho, but i love zoning people out with ky
[4:38:16] <Shad0wTag> @d3va As long your enjoying the game
[4:38:17] <+Dova573> Ill try to get on after i eat
[4:38:45] <%CaptainPileDriver> he's a texas daddy
[4:39:07] <D3va> i am having fun for sure
[4:39:14] <user_naim> i super choked too. always too sacred of the grab
[4:39:32] <%Waage83> Nice
[4:39:34] <%CaptainPileDriver> cheeky
[4:39:35] <Dante_Namikaze1> F
[4:39:45] <+willfangs> Lewis is so kill but it feels like he's stuff for his kit
[4:39:48] <%Waage83> the disrespect
[4:39:48] <tetrabrick1lt> 4Head
[4:39:50] <+willfangs> *so cool
[4:40:04] <%Irridium> GG goldlewis is ass bro LUL
[4:40:07] <Shad0wTag> Hearing him in the dub say hoss casually sounds cool
[4:40:16] <+Hollow_Mirage> Hose Down the System?
[4:40:19] <BanHero> nago is a bad matchup for gold dick
[4:40:22] <%Breedofevil> i liked playing Xrd but i got into it after fighterz launched so i was real late
[4:40:37] <morow1ec> goldlevis dub voice is better then jp imo
[4:40:40] <%CaptainPileDriver> UNGA BUNGA TIME
[4:40:49] <%Irridium> @BanHero everyone is a bad matchup for gold dick honestly. He struggles in neutral against Foust for god's sake
[4:40:50] <Shad0wTag> @breedofevil It happens dude
[4:40:51] <%CaptainPileDriver> get your gorilla hands out for some unga
[4:40:54] <Dante_Namikaze1> just realized that Ky in Japanese is Future Trunks and I wasn't expecting that
[4:41:17] <flubdy_> !schedule
[4:41:18] <@Moobot> @flubdy_ Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1420054806341816326?s=19
[4:41:19] <BanHero> i think nago is especially bad though
[4:41:25] <Shad0wTag> Don't forget how Goldlewis when he bursts just full blown swears
[4:41:28] <D3va> i have a question tho because i get shit on by ino, the sliding guitar thing that staggers you, how do you block that
[4:41:35] <BanHero> against goldleweis i mean
[4:41:44] <Shad0wTag> @d3va blow low
[4:41:50] <Shad0wTag> *block
[4:42:23] <D3va> i was sure i did that maybe i am wrong
[4:42:25] <%CaptainPileDriver> ye
[4:42:36] <%Irridium> @BanHero Absolutely. Nago can out-range every one of his moves mid-range. Only long one that reaches is 6HS and that's so slow nago can just react to it
[4:42:44] <+willfangs> ArcSys needs to fix the lobby system big time
[4:42:45] <%Waage83> atleast it is fixable
[4:42:50] <%CaptainPileDriver> goldlewis isnt very good
[4:42:54] <%CaptainPileDriver> unless you get the 1 hit
[4:42:56] <Dante_Namikaze1> @d3va block low it's worked for me when I remember to do it
[4:43:07] <%Waage83> I can live with firty stations and garbage lobby for the amazicing netplay
[4:43:10] <%Irridium> what defense LUL
[4:43:12] <+willfangs> Max got pretty miserable playing him especially against Geo
[4:43:12] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:43:35] <D3va> i will try the next time i play against an ino player
[4:43:37] <%Breedofevil> i wanna play more grapplers because in fighterz i mained dunkdroid 16. any good grapplers other than pot?
[4:43:40] <BaslerJones> its really weird to me when dlc character suck a lot
[4:43:45] <Shad0wTag> I think if Goldlewis had 1 hit of armour on his heavy slash that would really help with his neutral
[4:44:17] <Shad0wTag> @breedofevil Sol unironically his command grab is good
[4:44:21] <D3va> i hope they bring slayer back
[4:44:24] <%CaptainPileDriver> yeaaaaah
[4:44:27] <%CaptainPileDriver> gg
[4:44:29] <+willfangs> Slayer would be dope
[4:44:34] <inorwise> is this celestial?
[4:44:43] <Thunderhog> @Shad0wTag yeah that would be cool, considering he puts his big ol coffin up almost as a shield
[4:44:45] <%CaptainPileDriver> @inorwise oceania park 4
[4:44:49] <Bloodhit> Blade mod for Nago is so cool looking
[4:44:54] <inorwise> oh ok
[4:45:16] <KINGRAY898> i need to get as good as you as nago, its rough out in these floors
[4:45:18] <Shad0wTag> ayy we got a ky
[4:45:45] <fugly_nick> Why do certain stations not work?
[4:45:51] <Shad0wTag> god knows dude
[4:45:58] <%CaptainPileDriver> these stations are so filthy the fuck
[4:46:05] <StarkMaximum> Oh, you're walking away? Instead of approaching me, you're walking right from me?
[4:46:07] <Neri011> john
[4:46:08] <BaslerJones> does anyone have disconnections mid matches ?
[4:46:20] <BlackermanZX> tim
[4:46:23] <%CaptainPileDriver> ooooooooof
[4:46:26] <Shad0wTag> we need an arc sys admin to get in here and clean these caba
[4:46:27] <+willfangs> Wifi warrior
[4:46:29] <Dante_Namikaze1> oh no
[4:46:30] <Shad0wTag> *cabs
[4:46:31] <%CaptainPileDriver> you can FEEL the delay
[4:46:32] <%Waage83> @fugly_nick i dont know if any one knows, but it is most likely some connection related to hand shakes
[4:46:32] <Hirumm> 400?

[4:57:36] <Shad0wTag> @user_naim Same, many times over I'd rather take a braindead Sol
[4:57:38] <%Waage83> to many buttons
[4:57:38] <oedocontroller> well that's sad.
[4:57:39] <300coolfactsaboutbears> He's become even stronger.

[4:58:18] <%mr_sups> IS that Pat from Pat stares at? Pat?
[4:58:21] <+willfangs> Rage when the opponent is cornered aint bad

[4:58:36] <fugly_nick> Damn he's ignoring Pat
[4:58:37] <+samuraiskitz> I booted up my strive and then he said ps4/5 rip
[4:58:43] <oedocontroller> this is Pat the children murderer
[4:58:46] <+R0kushi> damn woolie is swinging
[4:58:57] <+StrawberryPantsu> Damn that is Pat
[4:59:08] <%Waage83> painfull
[4:59:10] <+StrawberryPantsu> I guess we'll find out on Monday :^)
[4:59:11] <BaslerJones> damn woolie got hands
[4:59:50] <oedocontroller> how to deal with potemkin :x
[5:00:02] <+StrawberryPantsu> Keep Potemkin out
[5:00:03] <clack14> don't let pot be near you
[5:00:04] <%Waage83> punches and kicks normaly works
[5:00:05] <Jerrymaino> This game looks fucking sick, but im pretty sure my internet wont like this type of game
[5:00:29] <GeoGio3> @Jerrymaino Rollback helps a lot
[5:00:33] <@Menitta> Which room
[5:00:34] <oedocontroller> lucky for you it has rollback
[5:00:41] <@Menitta> or is this tower matches
[5:00:50] <oedocontroller> it makes my wifi coable
[5:00:51] <Thunderhog> oceiana 4
[5:00:52] <+R0kushi> lmao
[5:00:54] <%Waage83> @Menitta Oceania 4
[5:00:55] <BlackermanZX> HOMERUN
[5:00:59] <Jerrymaino> Does that really make that much of a difference? Im on a 4G in the middle of a forest
[5:01:02] <+StrawberryPantsu> I mean "Don't let Potemkin near you and Keep Potemkin out " is easier said than done
[5:01:06] <bigepic69> He truly was a Guilty Gear Strive
[5:01:07] <+StrawberryPantsu> But Do those things
[5:01:44] <oedocontroller> im a ram main. I can zone the f out of him, but i can't withstand whenever he gets close
[5:01:59] <oedocontroller> and he can just jump the entire screen whenever he can
[5:02:18] <+R0kushi> cleean
[5:02:25] <bigepic69> Oh, Woolie, have you seen the mods for this game? My faves are the Steamed hams intro and the Potemkin Broly ass Buster
[5:02:26] <%Irridium> he wanted it so bad LUL
[5:02:31] <clack14> besides whiffing his super dunno how pot can jump the entire screen oedocontroller
[5:02:33] <%Waage83> NOOOO
[5:02:36] <+askalta> nice
[5:02:37] <KINGRAY898> i wish i could juggle like that with nago
[5:02:58] <oedocontroller> he just dashes
[5:03:00] <KINGRAY898> these ps4 sticks be rough
[5:03:19] <+Prinny_Raider> close slash doesn't protect nago's head?
[5:03:27] <+FoxLex_> PC?
[5:03:36] <clack14> LUL
[5:04:00] <Shad0wTag> I was panicking so much oh lord
[5:04:08] <user_naim> PS4/5 @foxlex_

[5:04:15] <SpookyMooks> get the fukkyo outta there
[5:04:23] <user_naim> Not bad tho still @shad0wtag
[5:04:27] <+FoxLex_> Ah shit then I'm logging in
[5:04:27] <kinggum41> is that the best song I hear
[5:04:30] <InfiniteSwagbito> Orange Ram with May's Theme, I see you
[5:04:30] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1420054806341816326?s=19
[5:04:40] <Dante_Namikaze1> @shad0wtag did better than me
[5:04:55] <FaxineiroDePosto> @SpookyMooks lol
[5:05:12] <+Cuon_Alpinus> Channel your inner hotashi woolie and just super everything
[5:05:15] <+Cuon_Alpinus> then die
[5:05:21] <bigepic69> I have a quanba obsidian stick and it's really, reeeaaaaaaally loose, like, if I let go of the stick, it inputs the opposite direction. I'm probably just going to use a keyboard because while inputs require more effort, it completely eliminates misinputs for me.
[5:05:43] <+Cuon_Alpinus> @bigepic69 yeah i got mad buyer's remorse with my qanba obsidian
[5:05:43] <InfiniteSwagbito> @Cuon_Alpinus live fast, die fast
[5:05:45] <@Menitta> I still use my Madcatz TE2 SFV edition from when SFV came out
[5:05:48] <+Cuon_Alpinus> the joystick is lowkey trash
[5:05:55] <@Menitta> Its served me well and has Chun Li on it
[5:05:56] <+Qexec> this ram really likes 214k
[5:06:08] <SpookyMooks> saved
[5:06:09] <InfiniteSwagbito> Ram had it, oof
[5:06:10] <yukichocomilk> this ram kinda just mashing stuff LUL
[5:06:11] <user_naim> @menitta good taste
[5:06:15] <+Cuon_Alpinus> might buy a sanwa replacement stick
[5:06:19] <clack14> totsugeki
[5:06:22] <+Cuon_Alpinus> or rip the one from my rap3
[5:06:27] <@Menitta> Im thinking of getting a new Qanba
[5:06:35] <%SkellyVee> SkellyVee subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months! <3
[5:06:40] <+Epic_Fubar> totsugeki
[5:06:41] <%Waage83> screw op my beam on the wall
[5:06:56] <BaslerJones> is Gio and Leo bad MUs for nago ? because i struggle against those two
[5:06:59] <+FoxLex_> Congrats Woolie, you finished a match before I could communicate with the server
[5:07:05] <Shad0wTag> wooliePOYO
[5:07:36] <+R0kushi> I dont think so, Gio is tough once she is in, but she also has a tough time gettin in
[5:07:46] <@Menitta> Woolie has finished several matches before I could connect lmao
[5:07:47] <+R0kushi> leo I am doing good against
[5:07:51] <kinggum41> Axel is satan
[5:07:54] <%CaptainPileDriver> ram and the fucking dolphin
[5:07:56] <SpookyMooks> millia really?
[5:07:57] <user_naim> Time for more behemoth typhoon
[5:07:57] <@Menitta> OK FINALLY
[5:08:05] <clack14> dick
[5:08:10] <raveous> Sol/Nago straight up a 5/5 MU
[5:08:15] <+Slime_Roy> chat ..... its not a big deal doodDerp
[5:08:17] <Demoli_PT> @WoolieVersus how do you feel about the chipp v nago match up? to me it feels super swingy one way or the other
[5:08:27] <+Slime_Roy> we can handle it SingsNote
[5:08:28] <%CaptainPileDriver> i do love his running animation
[5:08:30] <+Cuon_Alpinus> lvl 3 helibomb lowkep best projectile in the game
[5:08:30] <PowerPakStream> I am here to support my son
[5:08:33] <+R0kushi> this match up is quite hard for goldlewis
[5:08:44] <Shad0wTag> in this behemoth typhoon, goldlewis does not listen to ruben lagdons alien conspiracy theories
[5:08:50] <%snausages_> what matchups are in dick's favour?
[5:08:54] <BaslerJones> Chipp from my experience has to work so damn hard to kill Nago while Nago just has to land a few F.S
[5:08:58] <%CaptainPileDriver> i don't think any
[5:09:02] <+Dova573> Guys is it ft2?
[5:09:07] <+Slime_Roy> now eat your CHEEESEEEEE doodYelp
[5:09:07] <%Afterman_> @Shad0wTag no one should listen to anything that dude says. hes awful
[5:09:09] <+RowenCleric> gold dick mirror is his best mu
[5:09:10] <+StrawberryPantsu> ZA KISS OF DEATH!
[5:09:13] <clack14> I can't think of a match up in lewis favor...
[5:09:24] <%snausages_> so is he just a meme then
[5:09:25] <Shad0wTag> @snausages_ anyone not faster than him or has crazy mobility
[5:09:26] <oedocontroller> dick seems like a good MU against everybody now, since nobody plays him
[5:09:27] <+R0kushi> its too early to tell
[5:09:33] <+R0kushi> but axl nago and gio
[5:09:35] <+R0kushi> are hell
[5:09:43] <clack14> yeah axl feels rough
[5:09:46] <+FoxLex_> @snausages_ No it's just a week 1 heavy character
[5:09:49] <+Dova573> Gol D Lewis is still Undercooked
[5:09:54] <+FoxLex_> He takes a lot of time to learn
[5:09:54] <+zanz_san> Yo bros, how's Strive been for everyone?
[5:09:57] <clack14> needs more sauce.
[5:09:57] <%kotl7> damn machine gun does no damage
[5:10:02] <%CaptainPileDriver> undercooked is what i would say
[5:10:03] <+Dova573> Time will tell if hes good
[5:10:05] <Shad0wTag> @afterman_ its a shame because he used to so normal
[5:10:09] <FaxineiroDePosto> he bringing a gun to a sword fight
[5:10:12] <+FoxLex_> Machine Gun isn't for damage
[5:10:19] <BaslerJones> maybe he is low tier like kliff but very duable
[5:10:20] <+FoxLex_> Mainly just chip and meter eating
[5:10:30] <oedocontroller> strive feels in favor of enemy player on pc
[5:10:33] <%kotl7> yeah I see that
[5:10:39] <DropAcidNotBombos> careful you dont overdose on that copium while you wait for Gold Lewis to get better
[5:10:42] <SpookyMooks> oof
[5:10:44] <%Waage83> Machine gun destroys most project tiles and even a few supers
[5:10:47] <Shad0wTag> however machine guns builds lots of burst for enemy like so much
[5:10:59] <clack14> DropAcidNotBombos not gonna wait just gonna play leo or pot :)
[5:11:00] <bigepic69> I love Goldlewis and Gio bu they have the same problem of having a really cool thing that they dont use enough
[5:11:14] <+Slime_Roy> 2020Shred SingsNote
[5:11:16] <+zanz_san> Nice
[5:11:32] <%Afterman_> @Shad0wTag yeah it sucks to see the shit he spews, very saddening.
[5:11:32] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[5:11:34] <+R0kushi> but you guys dont know how good it feels to swing that coffin
[5:11:38] <InfiniteSwagbito> Diehard Japan Enthusiast vs. Diehard America Enthusiast
[5:11:47] <+Cuon_Alpinus> this lewis using mingun way too much sadge
[5:11:57] <+lag2993> is this ps or pc
[5:12:04] <%CaptainPileDriver> ps
[5:12:04] <%Waage83> Go lewis
[5:12:07] <+Slime_Roy> GGs
[5:12:07] <bigepic69> i love the dumb face lewis makes when he uses the hammer of dawn
[5:12:10] <+zanz_san> shizur6Gg
[5:12:29] <+Cuon_Alpinus> gotta respect lvl 2 or 3 beam
[5:12:31] <+StrawberryPantsu> IS THAT SHINGO!
[5:12:32] <%Irridium> Only 1 or was that 2?
[5:12:48] <%CaptainPileDriver> that was 2
[5:12:50] <+zanz_san> what's the buff that Nagi needs?
[5:12:51] <+FoxLex_> Also bomb is better for oki rhsn Skyfish
[5:12:55] <Shad0wTag> @afterman_ dude I remember not even long ago when his fiance who cosplays lady proposed to him at a con and it was so sweet and now I'm like what is this dude on
[5:13:00] <%CaptainPileDriver> go green person
[5:13:00] <%Irridium> alright got confused s'all
[5:13:02] <+FoxLex_> *than
[5:13:04] <%CaptainPileDriver> your time to shine
[5:13:06] <oedocontroller> is launching strive on console long enough for a toilet break?
[5:13:14] <%CaptainPileDriver> yes
[5:13:16] <+R0kushi> yes
[5:13:17] <%Irridium> Yes
[5:13:24] <@Menitta> lmao
[5:13:27] <Shad0wTag> yes
[5:13:29] <%CaptainPileDriver> you can take a shit by the time it logs onto the server
[5:13:34] <oedocontroller> still?
[5:13:45] <%Irridium> And all that stuff is super re-actable mid-close range
[5:13:45] <Shad0wTag> pretty much
[5:13:48] <%snausages_> There's a mod on pc that fixes it now
[5:13:53] <oedocontroller> jeez they just dont give a fuck, feels like
[5:13:57] <+FoxLex_> True but you get an unseeable high low with Burn It Down
[5:14:24] <Davimotion96> Cali bursting smh
[5:14:31] <bigepic69> I wish this game would continually play music instead of starting it over and over and over again when the match ends and begins. These tunes fuck hard and they end before they get that good thrusting going
[5:14:41] <clack14> @snausages_ what's the name?
[5:14:43] <Shad0wTag> @oedocontroller on the podcast they mentioned its because your pinging an authentication server in JP and that's why it takes so long but take that with a grain of salt
[5:14:49] <+Prinny_Raider> Gio's 2D is INSANE
[5:15:03] <%snausages_> The mod is called Totsugeki, if you google totsugeki github you should find it
[5:15:06] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's eating you toes
[5:15:08] <%CaptainPileDriver> look out
[5:15:14] <Demoli_PT> might be the input delay
[5:15:17] <SpookyMooks> greedy rollback
[5:15:35] <clack14> @snausages_ Thank you! found it :)
[5:15:42] <oedocontroller> on pc rollback feels like it's literally eating half of my inputs
[5:16:09] <+FoxLex_> 3-4 rollbaco frames tend to get crazy
[5:16:11] <%CaptainPileDriver> man, when you RC and still get hit that's soul damage
[5:16:22] <happy_void> lol
[5:16:23] <yukichocomilk> hotashi plays
[5:16:24] <@Menitta> niiice
[5:16:24] <bigepic69> guys im gonna say it i never liked the numpad directions we started using. My brain is too fat and slow to do the MENTAL MATH required to convert numbers into directions.
[5:16:25] <SpookyMooks> nice
[5:16:29] <+Qexec> he did the thing
[5:16:37] <oedocontroller> does rc cancel the hit?
[5:16:43] <%CaptainPileDriver> no
[5:16:47] <%CaptainPileDriver> rc slows them down
[5:16:49] <%snausages_> apparently the server connection problem is cause Strive creates a TCP connection for 127 individual requests
[5:16:54] <Shad0wTag> @bigepic69 dude I feel you, I only can barely remember what is what
[5:16:55] <oedocontroller> would you use it for defence somehow?
[5:17:02] <%CaptainPileDriver> yes
[5:17:06] <+zanz_san> Nago needs more crazy samsho damage
[5:17:13] <%CaptainPileDriver> when blocking and you have meter, you get a yellow RC
[5:17:17] <+R0kushi> english is not my first lenguage so my brain takes time to understand quarter back circle foward shenanigans
[5:17:24] <%CaptainPileDriver> but you can fuck people up with weird timing blue rc
[5:17:24] <+R0kushi> so numpad for me is great
[5:17:26] <user_naim> gg again lol. feels like i’m fighting boss nago
[5:17:29] <+FoxLex_> Dang Wooloe you showing no respect to a +5 Super
[5:17:29] <BaslerJones> I sorta prefer the FRC stuff +R
[5:17:32] <user_naim> sorry for rollback
[5:17:41] <BaslerJones> I like the RC stuff on this but idk why i like the +R rc
[5:17:41] <oedocontroller> i didn't see ppl doing that tho
[5:17:53] <SpookyMooks> Hey @woolieversus have you ever played any of the SMT games?
[5:17:54] <Shad0wTag> @r0kushi I'm sure if you ask in the chat to translate the num pad notions someone will tell you
[5:18:00] <monzy101> it plus
[5:18:09] <%CaptainPileDriver> filrthy
[5:18:24] <InfiniteSwagbito> Hmmmmmmmm?
[5:18:25] <%Exiliator> oooh

[5:18:49] <%Waage83> The stations dont like faust and his wierd alien ways
[5:18:49] <Shad0wTag> We're gonna see SMT3 for sure
[5:18:51] <SpookyMooks> I got 3 HD recently
[5:18:58] <%CaptainPileDriver> i hate getting stuck to the machines
[5:19:14] <morow1ec> Apocalypse is very good
[5:19:14] <SpookyBeef7> Man, really hoping ArcSys fixes this whole lobby system soon.
[5:19:16] <SpookyMooks> ONE MORE GOD REJECTED
[5:19:23] <+Dova573> I dint finished 4
[5:19:23] <bigepic69> I need to finish Strange Journey.
[5:19:23] <+Cuon_Alpinus> actual worst song
[5:19:24] <morow1ec> better gameplay then 4
[5:19:27] <+FoxLex_> Oh good, Lily
[5:19:29] <InfiniteSwagbito> Apocalypse will absolutely turn into Woolie Vs. God, but for real this time
[5:19:39] <+FoxLex_> The biggest hype killing song
[5:19:40] <Shad0wTag> SMT4 is a real improvement @woolieversus and the music is on point
[5:19:41] <+zanz_san> SMT 4 reminds me a lot of the Demon City Shinjuku
[5:19:41] <BaslerJones> i need to finish SMT 1 actually, really like it
[5:19:45] <oedocontroller> does anybody else feels like parks are 90% filled with F10 players?
[5:19:45] <+Dova573> My mindglobins got the better of me when I couldnt get th eending i wanted
[5:19:52] <bigepic69> alright I love Lily, my dog's name is Lily and I will FIGHT YOU IN THE STREETS AND SHEETS if you disagree

[5:25:07] <%CaptainPileDriver> this axl won't even attempt time stop
[5:25:07] <user_naim> I can dip if someone new shows up btw. Just @ me
[5:25:07] <BaslerJones> does burst regenerate faster here than in the other games or is it about the same ?
[5:25:12] <BaslerJones> never really paid attention
[5:25:14] <+NaughtySenpai69> thanks though guys
[5:25:15] <%Waage83> nice
[5:25:16] <Smitteys867> does anybody else think the music from Xrd is super quiet in this game?
[5:25:21] <flubdy_> Axl seems so annoying to play against
[5:25:22] <bigepic69> just like a hostess cafe
[5:25:29] <%Irridium> @Smitteys867 yeah it is
[5:25:35] <+Cuon_Alpinus> If you FD in the air when he pulls you with up followup after projectile, he's minus
[5:25:35] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[5:25:37] <Shad0wTag> @smitteys867 all non strive songs are super quiet
[5:25:41] <Dante_Namikaze1> @flubdy_ he is
[5:25:45] <Shad0wTag> @flubdy_ he is
[5:25:48] <+BillHicks5051> Ive heard people saying that the mixes from other games are too low
[5:25:55] <+BillHicks5051> bad sound engineering
[5:25:56] <+jiggles___> oof
[5:26:05] <Quikanims> man, axl is so lame lol
[5:26:19] <%CaptainPileDriver> the power of the british punk
[5:26:20] <Shad0wTag> @quikanims hey if works
[5:26:24] <@Menitta> Axl is cool but hes lame
[5:26:29] <+Ricky_Rexx> Wish even in Japanese Axl had an obnoxious accent
[5:26:30] <@Menitta> but he's also cool
[5:26:37] <Quikanims> @Shad0wTag it works, and it's lame and tedious
[5:26:40] <bigepic69> honestly I just mute the music ingame and play my own playlist of GG music because the constant start and stop infuriates me so hard
[5:26:41] <+R0kushi> yeah, he is cool but its lame, thats the best definition
[5:26:58] <%Waage83> I like this axels game plan
[5:27:00] <%Irridium> fun fact Axl can easily react and punish every single one of goldlewis' ranged options
[5:27:02] <@Menitta> I can dig this kind of ranged character
[5:27:02] <bigepic69> Axl be like CAM ON INGERLAND
[5:27:04] <Shad0wTag> @quikanims honestly if his timestop had more utility he could be cooler
[5:27:05] <%Waage83> go in and then back dodge
[5:27:07] <oedocontroller> axl is such an annoying char xD
[5:27:12] <+BillHicks5051> I put on some Enya and practice combos
[5:27:24] <%CaptainPileDriver> axl is the kind of character that would make normal people quit
[5:27:33] <SpookyMooks> full respect to this player but axl is a little shit
[5:27:33] <Quikanims> @Shad0wTag i wish ino got one vision instead, seeing as she is actually cool and would make use of it
[5:27:37] <oedocontroller> imo that's pote
[5:27:41] <Shad0wTag> @bigepic69 we need octopimp to do another offical axl shitpost
[5:27:55] <Smitteys867> I really love axl but i kinda feel bad if everyone i play isn't having fun
[5:27:58] <Shad0wTag> @quikanims I agree
[5:28:03] <+Cuon_Alpinus> FD the up swipe pls
[5:28:09] <+Cuon_Alpinus> leaves him minus
[5:28:12] <%CaptainPileDriver> do the wakeup super axl
[5:28:15] <@Menitta> I'm still thinking about that Goldlewis cosplay trailer some guy made before they announced him
[5:28:30] <bigepic69> Cant stop thinking about the Broly ass Potemkin with Chipp between his cheeks it makes me laugh every time
[5:28:36] <Quikanims> @Menitta MIGHTY GIRTH AIN'T HALF IT'S WORTH
[5:28:41] <Thunderhog> @Menitta Mustached villain you mean
[5:28:42] <@Menitta> LUL

[5:30:15] <%CaptainPileDriver> TIMESTOP MY GEEE
[5:30:23] <%CaptainPileDriver> timestop for style
[5:30:25] <+zanz_san> I really hate that Axl lost all his counters in the past games
[5:30:34] <+Dova573> GGS
[5:30:38] <+Cuon_Alpinus> @SpookyMooks clearly the cosplay vid is teasing his IK when they add them (arcsys pls)
[5:31:11] <+Dova573> Woolie I gotta be honst that super was by accidieent

[5:35:23] <SpookyMooks> I really hope the "Other Story" dlc explains more character stuff, e.g Faust's new look but I get it's a long shot
[5:35:24] <GeoGio3> the mask goes into the fro!
[5:35:26] <DSD24> That's pretty rad
[5:35:30] <+R0kushi> yeah, nago used to wear a afro lmao
[5:35:43] <+RowenCleric> I wish we could get the afro version of every character, Gio looks dope with it
[5:35:44] <DSD24> Nago going "I've still got it"
[5:35:48] <SpookyMooks> Or an Afro Samurai
[5:35:52] <+FadingFrost> Make his music Barry white
[5:35:53] <kinggum41> give nago the expression
[5:35:54] <%CaptainPileDriver> arcsys doesn't seem to like costumes for some reason.
[5:35:55] <bigepic69> Oh, Woolie, did you try the New Nier mobile game? It's... another grindfest that I dont have the patience for in spite of some jive tunes, great presentation, art, and a good story.
[5:36:04] <user_naim> @rowencleric I got a burniing afro end screen with Gio once, it was sick
[5:36:11] <BaslerJones> Ky's theme rocks so much
[5:36:17] <%Waage83> hahaha
[5:36:20] <+R0kushi> its not that easy to make costumes in the way arc sys does its characters
[5:36:22] <+yuribo26> "OH NO" - Knuckles, 1998
[5:36:22] <oedocontroller> whenever faust throws the afro on the ground, i pick it for drip reasons xD
[5:36:34] <user_naim> @oedocontroller absolutely

[5:37:17] <SpookyMooks> that potemkin dolphin mod is cursed af
[5:37:22] <%CaptainPileDriver> did you guy's know someone made a second thicc millia mod?
[5:37:35] <user_naim> @bigepic69 considering the air movement, Nago should be a Fall Guy
[5:37:40] <BlackermanZX> damn woolie's nago is lookin clean
[5:37:40] <+TestAnon> I've already seen a kfc colonel gold dickenson

[5:41:49] <oedocontroller> that was the question xD i only use them to cancel super anim for ram
[5:41:55] <bigepic69> I just remembered, for any of you still keeping up with the Blizz situation, they got rid of the ability to /spit on people because people kept spitting on people who bought store mounts, meanwhile the N-word is still allowed
[5:41:58] <+yuribo26> Don't worry Woolie, no one was watching

[5:43:06] <%CaptainPileDriver> DISASTER OF PASSION
[5:43:08] <Davimotion96> It's mandatory for a final game
[5:43:09] <black_mages_matter_> not as hype as THIS
[5:43:15] <+FoxLex_> We wouldn't hear it well tho since all old music has a lower volume
[5:43:16] <%jolene_orenji> @InfiniteSwagbito MAY BULKED UP
[5:43:16] <SpookyBeef7> The fact that they hide so much of the good unlockable stuff from fishing behind a bunch of avatar cosmetics is frustrating.
[5:43:16] <user_naim> HELL YEAH THIS SONG
[5:43:18] <user_naim> Perfect
[5:43:21] <clack14> @oedocontroller did you play sfv before?
[5:43:22] <BackflipCharm> Everyone who hates this song needs to expand their musical horizons
[5:43:24] <bigepic69> I want a 1 in 1000000000 chance for the intro to be replaced with the Mario and Sonic take on me kissing
[5:43:25] <+itsOnyxLeo> You could see Woolie's sole leave his body when Passion started
[5:43:34] <+Atomic_ColliderSG> I'm still fishing for Big Blast Sonic BibleThump
[5:43:39] <+ryuguitarfreak> Not having Still in Dark, riding Disaster of Passion instead. Perfect.
[5:43:40] <%CaptainPileDriver> this pot is the hero
[5:43:44] <oedocontroller> no. Only arcys games since birth
[5:43:48] <Dante_Namikaze1> @spookybeef7 pissed me off and Dragon Ball when I was trying to unlock colors for all the characters I used but kept getting avatars for characters I would never use

[5:47:48] <bigepic69> I love may's theme in this game but actually playing against her makes me wish all of her little maritime critters would be put into that one Aquarium in Florida for disabled fish.

[5:51:37] <Demoli_PT> you're supposed to trade at long distance with his big disjoints, then either burn it down or thunderbird
[5:51:50] <bigepic69> he needs to use his alien friend more
[5:51:56] <+Cuon_Alpinus> security lvl 3 helibomb is best projectile in the game

[5:52:51] <+nial_evol> and gets pinned by axl 5p
[5:52:52] <Demoli_PT> he already has 2 ways to force people into his ideal range, the helibomb and BiD
[5:53:11] <bigepic69> I'm gonna say it, he needs another Behemoth Typhoon.
