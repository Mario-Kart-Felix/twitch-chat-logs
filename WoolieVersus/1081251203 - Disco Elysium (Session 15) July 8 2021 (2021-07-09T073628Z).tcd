[0:05:24] <%krispen_wa> PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt
[0:05:31] <Pt_Kamen> oh "Montreal Canadiens, a National Hockey League team, whose nickname is 'Habs', short for 'Les Habitants' Habitants, the early farmers of Quebec."
[0:05:35] <%Vigonept> what if that person sucks shit
[0:05:36] <%ihavesillyknees> how far we at in Disco?
[0:05:38] <servicesuspension> That's your mistake, Woolie, they're fucking winging it!

[0:07:08] <+kullumanati> Reggie 6Pd the TBL
[0:07:09] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> THIS MESSAGE BROUGHT TO YOU BY ARTESIAN BUILDS
[0:07:11] <%ihavesillyknees> Far far left mofo
[0:07:15] <balthazar758> ReggieVs (ft. Woolie of Madden)
[0:07:17] <Pt_Kamen> Pat is talking about FFXIV, Woolie is zoning out
[0:07:20] <servicesuspension> Reggie deserves a sports segment in every podcast. I don't even like sports
[0:07:22] <%Lion_kun> This is the best Reggie.
[0:07:31] <%zanz_san> please clip this
[0:07:37] <%dds333a> Sure was LUL
[0:07:38] <+Jeshk0> what did i just miss????
[0:07:39] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @woolieversus ngl Reggie should go off more, this is fucking gold
[0:07:46] <%ihavesillyknees> We need a Reggie sports section for this stream.
[0:07:48] <Tracazoid> So how long until Reggie is on Castesuperbeast and turns the podcast into a sportscast LUL
[0:07:53] <Pt_Kamen> The Habs drop pucks?
[0:07:56] <dewwy125> is it coming home lads?
[0:08:09] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @jeshk0 Reggie going off about the Habs crapping out in the Stanley Cup finals
[0:08:12] <%dds333a> They dump em too
[0:08:13] <Pt_Kamen> It means something to someone
[0:08:13] <balthazar758> Castle Sport Beasts
[0:08:17] <+illusiveSaint> who would've thought Florida would have a good hockey team 2 yrs in a row
[0:08:24] <+Jeshk0> oh reggie is FeelsBadMan about tampa bay winning
[0:08:37] <%ihavesillyknees> lol
[0:08:40] <%dds333a> Oh boy
[0:08:41] <asdief_> Were they talking about soccer?
[0:08:43] <%chandlerofearth> ReggieVs presents Get Into Hockey Games
[0:08:47] <%zanz_san> Tampa has been crazy about how crazy for a while
[0:08:48] <%notsoy> Get Into (Sports) Games Featuring NHL 2021
[0:09:01] <%meniscate> FYI @woolieversus White Mourning is known to cause bugs (screen freezing) during a later sidequest. The extra zoom out messes with the framing. You can either forget it or you could mess around with graphics settings until you solve it. It's a pain to do tho and White Mourning is pretty useless too.
[0:09:09] <%zanz_san> hockey
[0:09:15] <leith_aziz> That's a weird perspective. Not saying its wrong
[0:09:16] <%zanz_san> dammit lol
[0:09:18] <Pt_Kamen> oh, now I know "A team will dump the puck in mainly for two reasons: to give time for their team to change lines while the game is going on, and as a strategy for an offensive attack as they seek to regain the puck that has just been shot in."
[0:09:31] <servicesuspension> people can't criticize something without someone else thinking OPPRESION AND CENSORSHIP
[0:09:47] <mgod19> Kreygasm
[0:09:51] <%Juriasu> please do it more often actually
[0:09:54] <linSP> Be a sicko, just own up to it?
[0:09:55] <%hax_metatron> @meniscate AFAIK that bug has been fixed in a recent patch, and if not a reload should fix it
[0:09:55] <%holydeviant1> Woolie dropping Elfen Lied's name right after Eyepatch Wolf dropped that referral to that awesome "why the fuck is it so popular here?!" video
[0:09:59] <Pt_Kamen> Wear the Funny Tie Bratan!
[0:10:01] <%holydeviant1> has me thinkin
[0:10:22] <leith_aziz> We have our opions and morals, but that's something we usually can only hold to ourselves. When it affects othher people though, it gets messy
[0:10:22] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:10:24] <%holydeviant1> TENPENNY TOWER
[0:10:25] <%dds333a> The Nathan Copeland thing was out of character
[0:10:25] <KaiserMario> "Don't criticize what I like, it's a personal attack!"
[0:10:27] <leith_aziz> *opinions
[0:10:31] <%holydeviant1> there you go triggered half the chat
[0:10:32] <iacus_> never understood why Elfen lied got popular, seemed pretty boring to me
[0:10:38] <%zanz_san> Woolie what happen to that Kshatriya you bought? Thinking about buying one.
[0:10:41] <%dds333a> That's it for me
[0:10:43] <Pt_Kamen> while Reggie was talking Woolie was listening to the mama daqua
[0:10:44] <Hammatime8> Sometimes shit's just fucking creepy
[0:10:50] <+Jeshk0> But a choice was made, and its fine to ask why that choice was made
[0:10:54] <%meniscate> @hax_metatron Really? I replayed the game a week or two ago and it was still there. Reloading and changing settings didn't help
[0:10:58] <servicesuspension> look man, I'm not saying it should be banned, but I AM saying that Strike Witches is a show about little girl cameltoe
[0:10:58] <Hammatime8> And sometimes people won't admit taht shit's creepy
[0:11:02] <%holydeviant1> tenpenny tower was my moral "what the fuck" in a videogame
[0:11:02] <iacus_> why would there be something wrong?
[0:11:02] <mgod19> lol
[0:11:07] <%Juriasu> Elfen Lied was alsmost sort of a joke but people didn't know and started seriously like it
[0:11:11] <leith_aziz> You mean the GOW# thing? Yeah, that was weird
[0:11:13] <JetpackMcQuack> If it's not adding anything cut it out
[0:11:14] <leith_aziz> *GOW3
[0:11:17] <mgod19> that's funny that that still bothers woolie after all these years
[0:11:27] <%krispen_wa> tenpennt tower was funny as fuck as a pure evil dude
[0:11:30] <balthazar758> that gow3 moment is very infamous
[0:11:37] <leith_aziz> My only guess is that it tried to sell you that Kratos was an asshole.
[0:11:37] <mr_sups> Are we STILL talking about Elfen Lied!?
[0:11:38] <iacus_> also someone not having the critical capacity to explain their reasons doesn't mean there are no reasons
[0:11:44] <%TheotherKristian> What's up with GOW3
[0:11:48] <BakiinPlaysStuff> That Jurassic World lady was the weirdest one
[0:11:52] <asdief_> most 80's action movies have horrible messages, they are still fun though
[0:11:54] <KaiserMario> GoW1 has that ship captain that Kratos kills twice for NO REASON
[0:11:58] <%dds333a> @iacus_ it's edge, and also because violence was the intent. it's also a poorly told story about what violence does to the innocent, both the perpetrators and the victims
[0:11:58] <%krispen_wa> Elfen Lied is guro for cowards who arent comfortable looking guro up on rule34
[0:12:01] <+illusiveSaint> goreporn
[0:12:03] <servicesuspension> meet a guy who's very into ryona manga and pretend you'd wanna be friends with him
[0:12:07] <Blank9> ideon does it too much
[0:12:10] <leith_aziz> Maybe that Kratos doesnt care about people that worship Olympis? I have no idea
[0:12:14] <servicesuspension> for freedom
[0:12:19] <@Menitta> Oh god
[0:12:20] <@Solidus_113> liveleak
[0:12:23] <@Menitta> thats fucked
[0:12:24] <Blank9> the kid getting their head blown off by a laser bazooka in ideo
[0:12:27] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> oh god the flashbacks
[0:12:29] <Chatterbox1991> @WoolieVersus Borderland Beat?
[0:12:30] <leith_aziz> I'll be honest, I hate fatalities because of workers getting PTSD
[0:12:31] <DianaTheAscian> if the show/game/movie is going "look how cool this is" thats when I go wtf
[0:12:32] <%dds333a> Hell yeah, Ogrish
[0:12:34] <%eanscrale> It's surprisingly popular, Golin Salyer was the most popular anime in the season it aired. Or maybe depressingly unsurprising.
[0:12:37] <+elderpunch> oh snuff
[0:12:38] <+illusiveSaint> liveleak, rotten it's a different kind of perverse
[0:12:38] <Nocturnment> Tomb Raider Devs
[0:12:38] <mgod19> that's its own level, when it's real snuff stuff
[0:12:41] <%meniscate> The laser gif with the anime girl
[0:12:44] <%kewlmyc> Yeah, I remember that phase in college where people would link beheading videos. Shit was weird.
[0:12:46] <DianaTheAscian> i knew a kid like that
[0:12:50] <+Superbro64> I AM interested in the fact that there isnt an alternate way to keep the gate open to progress, if you didnt want to kill of the girl, since it is a player action you do, and not a cutscene @woolieversus
[0:12:51] <leith_aziz> Fatalities also give no characterisation, they just end up being ludonarrative dissonance
[0:12:54] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> the horror the 2000s internet and those videos
[0:13:04] <%holydeviant1> I don't think woolie would ban anything because he doesn't use the word PROBLEMATIC
[0:13:04] <+elderpunch> @leith_aziz exacto
[0:13:15] <olaksi> feels like you need a psych degree to dissect that
[0:13:16] <%Vigonept> is like drawing gore super detailed weirs?
[0:13:19] <%holydeviant1> in that he doesn't view it as something to be fixed, just strange, bizarre and maybe creepy
[0:13:20] <%krispen_wa> goblin slayer is hentai for cowards too scared to look up the goblin tag on rule34
[0:13:26] <Chatterbox1991> It might just be voyerism
[0:13:26] <leith_aziz> That's why I like some character specific Insta Kills in Guilty Gear.
[0:13:27] <Ziegsy> hey chat, we close to finishing?
[0:13:32] <die_hardman> I wouldn’t really attribute malice to watching liveleak or some gore. It’s just morbid curiosity, for most people.
[0:13:40] <leith_aziz> Dizzy for example will never kill the opponent in her IK
[0:13:41] <Pt_Kamen> use Emergence
[0:13:41] <mgod19> elfen leid is tame to me Kappa
[0:13:42] <+Tuffty> Yep
[0:13:45] <asdief_> update the references
[0:13:46] <servicesuspension> that's how malice begins
[0:13:48] <iacus_> I don't agree, and I think psychology doesn't either (i.e. expressing/exploring a thought isn't the same as acting on that thought)
[0:13:51] <leith_aziz> What is Elfen Lied?
[0:13:53] <DianaTheAscian> its also kind of obscure
[0:14:03] <%meniscate> But The Serbian Film has artistic and political themes
[0:14:03] <%kyh9> What are we talking about?
[0:14:07] <%cobalt_phoenix_> wait what'd i miss? how did this start?
[0:14:07] <asdief_> hahaha
[0:14:07] <Pt_Kamen> emergence is quite tame, but it's meme material
[0:14:07] <Blank9> goblin slayer
[0:14:09] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @die_hardman it's one thing to watch it a few times, or have a phase when you're young, I think it's more about people who enjoy that kind of media
[0:14:13] <%Lion_kun> Anime was a mistake.
[0:14:14] <@Solidus_113> Higurashi gets pretty bad with it no?
[0:14:18] <servicesuspension> putting that thought out there is the same as thinking it? depends in how it's handlded
[0:14:19] <%kewlmyc> Higurashi went pretty far with the recent series.
[0:14:25] <@Menitta> I never even seen elfen lied other than that one shot everyone's seen of the naked girl covered in blood lol
[0:14:28] <%dds333a> Goblin Slayer is not worse.
[0:14:29] <%X2Eliah> obsessive fascination (or arousal) with creepy stuff is not necessarily...normal.
[0:14:30] <%mariothemaio> @Solidus_113 it does, but there is a point in the narrative to it
[0:14:35] <mgod19> I thought that was gow2?
[0:14:35] <Pt_Kamen> Nice Boat meme flashbacks
[0:14:37] <+elderpunch> re do of healer was overblown but its still pretty whack
[0:14:37] <%krispen_wa> goblin slayer is soft-porn
[0:14:44] <Nocturnment> I believe its Poseidon's daughter or something?
[0:14:45] <olaksi> vapid is the perfect description of goblin slayer
[0:14:46] <+Superbro64> but there in fact IS president, you as the player controlling Kratos, have killed random bystanders in order to solve puzzles before, I remember a block pushing puzzle in 2 or 3 where you have a grandpa get crushed in a weight to progress through a gate @woolieversus
[0:14:51] <mgod19> hard to remember, Kratos kills so many women Kappa
[0:14:53] <%holydeviant1> The cheevo is the dealbreaker
[0:14:53] <leith_aziz> I never got that moment other than Kratos being an ass
[0:14:54] <%dds333a> Poseidon had a maiden
[0:14:55] <RushUnplugged> goblin slayer just sucks
[0:14:55] <JetpackMcQuack> ask me not to care gameattackWut
[0:14:56] <primaryfire> touch grass and talk to human beings
[0:14:56] <%zanz_san> Tomino had parents and family friends that worked with war criminals and that sorta inspired his depictions of war in Gundam
[0:14:58] <leith_aziz> Seems so bizarre
[0:14:58] <iacus_> @X2Eliah doesn't mean it's pathologic
[0:15:00] <+Superbro64> GoW 1 or 2, excuse me
[0:15:02] <%mariothemaio> School Days is waaaay worse than Elfein Lied oh man
[0:15:05] <servicesuspension> I think the difference is if there's narrative focus for something bad happening, or stylish, instead of someone just enjoying the pain
[0:15:09] <%Lion_kun> Goblin Slayer has very little non goblin violence and it is usually to prove a point.
[0:15:11] <TheyCallMeVawn> I dont think that was the implication
[0:15:12] <%Arnoldoaad1> Its a very pre-metoo moment
[0:15:12] <%dds333a> LUL
[0:15:18] <%X2Eliah> @X2Eliah neither does it mean that it isnt
[0:15:20] <servicesuspension> that's why stuff like porn is not the same as things that feature themes
[0:15:22] <Deko_> LUL
[0:15:25] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Personally yeah the act of it being in there is still weird but having an achievement in there makes it extra bad feeling
[0:15:26] <+elderpunch> LUL
[0:15:31] <%Juriasu> good thing we can weponize Pat against Jaffe
[0:15:33] <Pt_Kamen> sus
[0:15:36] <%meniscate> The greater School Days lore is crazy. Everyone's related to each other
[0:15:37] <AnneSQF> I agree with you Woolie, but I don't have anything else to add...
[0:15:38] <%dds333a> Reg's face LUL
[0:15:46] <mgod19> lol
[0:15:49] <BlackermanZX> down real bad
[0:15:54] <leith_aziz> That's what turned me off MK probably
[0:15:55] <die_hardman> @abelincoln_catpuncher but those people have issues that are outside of those sites. Some people make the conclusion that just watching or even seeking out gore pics is the cause, when that’s really just a shallow view. What u think?
[0:15:57] <%krispen_wa> Woolie Kinkshaming guro enthusiasts
[0:16:00] <mgod19> what are talking about again?
[0:16:01] <%Lion_kun> We don't kinkshame Woolie.
[0:16:04] <asdief_> I think eleven lied was for edgy teens thinking gore makes something mature
[0:16:04] <+elderpunch> hasO
[0:16:04] <%mariothemaio> LUL
[0:16:04] <KaitlynnHere> Uh oh, what happened?
[0:16:06] <+DukeBlack_> talk to them!! gwdTawk
[0:16:08] <iacus_> @X2Eliah that's meaningless though. you could say that about anything
[0:16:09] <Zedkan> damn i thought people liked Elfen Lied. ive never seen it
[0:16:10] <+Tuffty> Shitty edgelords that just want to show you a bunch of shit just to shock you gets old real quick. Makes up for a lack of personality
[0:16:13] <OblivionSword1> someone link woolie that one video by hazel
[0:16:14] <%dds333a> @meniscate Never forget the name of Tomaru Hishigata
[0:16:14] <Chatterbox1991> i mean at the same time morally disecting people over video games is a bit iffy
[0:16:19] <%meniscate> B-But my puppy and chick crushing tho...
[0:16:19] <Hammatime8> Nah, I kinkshame :)
[0:16:19] <servicesuspension> I find it funny how the two guys who are super into freedom here in the chat are the guys that complain every episode that woolie hasn't done a quest
[0:16:20] <mgod19> not very progressive Kappa
[0:16:22] <%Lion_kun> I WAS JOKING
[0:16:22] <BlackermanZX> kink shaming is my kink
[0:16:22] <%notsoy> Kiryu doesn't kink-shame, Woolie does
[0:16:24] <primaryfire> don't be a sociopath
[0:16:24] <Pt_Kamen> don't dump your pucks near Reggie
[0:16:25] <stormhawk9891> We ABOSLUTELY kinkshame on this channel
[0:16:30] <servicesuspension> no man, kinkshame to the max
[0:16:38] <Nocturnment> Nah nah kinkshaming is cool
[0:16:38] <servicesuspension> KINKSHAME TO THE MEGA
[0:16:38] <die_hardman> @servicesuspension backseat gaming
[0:16:38] <Ecall10528> Woolie is the most kinkshame.
[0:16:39] <%derap41> This was a weird place to enter this stream
[0:16:39] <%holydeviant1> Those games don't get released as much anymore
[0:16:40] <%Lion_kun> I WAS KIDDING
[0:16:46] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Like the acheivement breaks the 4th wall and acknowledges the act
[0:16:46] <olaksi> roll Drama!
[0:16:49] <%Seancicle> We don't kinkshame, except when we do.
[0:16:54] <%chandlerofearth> kinkshaming ends at serial killee warning signs
[0:16:55] <mgod19> super best shame casts
[0:16:55] <%X2Eliah> "we dont kinkshame" is afucking stupid take when some ppl literally want to watch a corpse being fucked.
[0:16:57] <%krispen_wa> Woolie searches for vanilla tags on rule34
[0:17:02] <%meniscate> PUNCH GIRLS are technically ryona
[0:17:06] <%dds333a> This reminds me of the Rapelay debacle
[0:17:07] <dewwy125> kinkshaming is perfectly valid
[0:17:28] <servicesuspension> "maybe this guy enjoys loli ryona for intellectual reasons"
[0:17:29] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:17:48] <+Tuffty> You can like Elfen Lied, fine whatever. But if Elfen Lied is your FAVOURITE show? Then it's weird.
[0:17:49] <iacus_> yeah blanket accusations are a sign of low consciousness/empathy
[0:18:00] <%krispen_wa> Woolie's kink is blatant racism
[0:18:11] <%holydeviant1> @Tuffty Gore aside EL has a lot of not super great narrative beats
[0:18:19] <Chatterbox1991> it might litterally just people who don't read into it because it's a video game
[0:18:25] <leith_aziz> Being suspicious is fine. I think we just want to understand why something so strange you find enjoyable
[0:18:29] <%Lion_kun> Kratos never brings that up with the Boys.
[0:18:35] <%MightyDuckShoes> How about people stop bringing up porn? Part of what makes these anime weird is that the stuff gets brought up in a supposedly not pornographic context which speaks even more for the creator when they don't have the excuse of venting sex hang ups
[0:18:38] <%Lion_kun> Boy*
[0:18:39] <leith_aziz> Sometimes clarification helps
[0:18:42] <+Mr_Pylon> Kratos would dump the puck.
[0:18:45] <Nocturnment> chat, y'all see that new Gundam movie?
[0:18:51] <mgod19> "things should exist" whoa slow down
[0:18:53] <%holydeviant1> Like, it's aggressively misogynist, not even in the sense of "ha ha fanservice and gore" but in the sense of "The childish, harmless version of the main character is the best version of her"
[0:18:59] <%meniscate> Such a MORALIST take
[0:18:59] <%dds333a> Oh god
[0:18:59] <%mariothemaio> can we go back to talking about hockey? :(
[0:19:00] <%krispen_wa> I dont KNOW you wooloe
[0:19:01] <%zanz_san> Hathaway is A+++++
[0:19:02] <%Vigonept> how was the gundam movie
[0:19:06] <Pt_Kamen> Reggie is still thinking about the Habs
[0:19:17] <%eanscrale> Elfen Lied sucks though, all the violence is super exaggeratedly goofy.
[0:19:18] <Airtola> what did i just walk into
[0:19:19] <%dds333a> @krispen_wa exactly
[0:19:20] <OblivionSword1> most mainstream consumer don't think about the media they consume
[0:19:25] <mgod19> the attitude era
[0:19:26] <KNYGHT87> Toxic Masculinity Gaming Industry
[0:19:28] <%LordSDB> I enjoy hearing these talks Woolie. I really do mean it. Even if I don't agree, its fun to hear these talks.
[0:19:29] <DianaTheAscian> Hathaway feels like set up to a later show they will make
[0:19:29] <%Lion_kun> I want it on the record, I was just joking.
[0:19:31] <%zanz_san> Shuko Murade is a great animation director
[0:19:39] <KaitlynnHere> I love edge boners
[0:19:41] <skyenoz> I mean it could just be people wanna see shit they don't see in normal days?
[0:19:42] <Deko_> how dare you
[0:19:44] <KaitlynnHere> XD
[0:19:47] <%Vigonept> are sicual issues anti grimdrak?
[0:19:48] <%X2Eliah> Low empathy
[0:19:49] <+elderpunch> LUL
[0:19:51] <asdief_> How dare you care
[0:19:54] <%holydeviant1> Amass a big enough audience and you have to cull it once in a while.
[0:19:55] <JetpackMcQuack> :) yep
[0:19:56] <+saltpiggu> TransgenderPride
[0:19:56] <Pt_Kamen> but those pucks the Habs keep dumping?
[0:19:58] <tomo_vendor> based
[0:19:58] <%zanz_san> Too more Hathaway movies
[0:20:00] <KaitlynnHere> Gasp! You care about other people???
[0:20:02] <+I4gotmyname89> LesbianPride
[0:20:04] <%mariothemaio> politics??? in GAMING?????? LUL
[0:20:04] <%derap41> Well those guys can just leave
[0:20:06] <asdief_> TransgenderPride
[0:20:06] <mgod19> that's a very specific example
[0:20:10] <leith_aziz> I have a feeling some people would have a thing for MK9 fatalities against the woman. Im guessing that's the kinda thing you'd find effed up? In that case, yeah that's weird
[0:20:14] <%chandlerofearth> TransgenderPride
[0:20:16] <+elderpunch> i cant believe you care about other human beings Kappa
[0:20:18] <iacus_> they're projecting
[0:20:22] <%derap41> Hey remember gamerGate?
[0:20:23] <%BisoromiBear> They can stay on /v/
[0:20:38] <die_hardman> @derap41 don’t start
[0:20:41] <%X2Eliah> @BisoromiBear +1
[0:20:44] <Pt_Kamen> seriously, some people look like they don't have social conscious
[0:20:47] <%dds333a> Repeatedly
[0:20:48] <%Juriasu> @leith_aziz MK is sort of okay, at least for me, both fighters are literally in a mortal kombat to the death
[0:20:49] <KaitlynnHere> Why make actual friends when you can make imaginary ones?
[0:21:02] <iacus_> why would you bully/harass a group of people for laughs? Never understood that. From either side
[0:21:04] <+kullumanati> Those are premium N pass ambassadors
[0:21:15] <%meniscate> Wömen tho amirite
[0:21:18] <@Menitta> all my friends are imaginary
[0:21:18] <leith_aziz> @Juriasu I don't know. By MK11 it's gone too far. The devs litterarly got PTSD from this
[0:21:19] <servicesuspension> Some things that were acceptable some time ago, are not acceptable right now. This for some reason baffles many
[0:21:24] <leith_aziz> What was the point ?
[0:21:26] <mgod19> yeah but that's making a lot of assumptions about someone you've never met
[0:21:27] <%LeeleeBB> I arrived in the middle of this rant and have no idea what's up
[0:21:29] <notadeasterisk> who knows could be a poor joke
[0:21:30] <%derap41> death of the author?
[0:21:31] <%dds333a> @iacus_ it's an extremely easy idea
[0:21:34] <+elderpunch> @kullumanati the people who fr took it seriously LUL
[0:21:37] <+mechslayer71> pizza cutters
[0:21:38] <KaitlynnHere> Measurehead the viewer
[0:21:39] <%krispen_wa> Gotta check those fascist points in your ledger after killing the slave girl
[0:21:43] <srv4254> the same rant happened yesterday i dont get it
[0:21:44] <KNYGHT87> Keep Talking
[0:21:51] <%Arnoldoaad1> the word is "immature" I think that the world has grown since
[0:21:53] <%mariothemaio> so about them hockey?
[0:21:55] <leith_aziz> I think it's fine that you bring this up
[0:21:56] <@Menitta> yeah I joined with no context lol
[0:21:56] <die_hardman> @leeleebb having weird and perhaps unethical interests, like being into gore.
[0:22:02] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @derap41 even with death of the author those things are still part of the story and game
[0:22:04] <%dds333a> @arnoldoaad1 not even close
[0:22:04] <leith_aziz> It's an interesting conversation
[0:22:05] <Picia000123> People have different pespectives on things, it's natural that someone else won't see the thing the way you do, Woolz
[0:22:07] <%zanz_san> Talking about Hathaway
[0:22:15] <Pt_Kamen> Naoki Urasawa (Monster, 21st Century Boys) doesn't even let his assistants draw dead bodys to not over burden them mentally, he does it himself
[0:22:15] <%krispen_wa> Anne Hathaway?
[0:22:20] <%meniscate> vibeo gane?
[0:22:20] <%Juriasu> @Juriasu Maybe I don't even know how bad those games get, I don't really play them because to be honest I'm not very into gore even if I'm fine with the content existing
[0:22:21] <%Seancicle> woolieLORE
[0:22:28] <TheMagneticDragon> Just beat Disco Elysuim because of you and Pat, first learned about the game via Mr Feel, thank you for the experience amigos
[0:22:30] <+saltpiggu> its throwaway
[0:22:32] <mgod19> so only do it to men Kappa
[0:22:34] <KaitlynnHere> Lmao! Yes, Anne Hathaway
[0:22:34] <cartoongabe> quentin tarintino movies ?
[0:22:36] <tattleworm> like 2/3rds of rlm's vhs collection
[0:22:38] <KaiserMario> "Kill the puppy" trope
[0:22:38] <notadeasterisk> meh
[0:22:45] <leith_aziz> @Juriasu ABI tourial turned me off of MK
[0:22:51] <iacus_> don't take it!
[0:22:55] <%Arnoldoaad1> @dds333a why not, I feel this conversation wouldnt exist when GoW happen
[0:22:57] <TheMagneticDragon> So have they started Disco Elysuim
[0:22:58] <%krispen_wa> FEET
[0:23:00] <%mariothemaio> reminds me of Jurassic Park? one of the movies with Chris Pratt, where they focused on a woman getting killed for an extended amount of time
[0:23:03] <servicesuspension> The focus is the more important thing. People rarely talk about focus. There's a difference if a character gets raped in a novel than in a porno. Focus is important to know what the audience wants out of it
[0:23:04] <skyenoz> he did NOT kill that guy
[0:23:04] <%derap41> Until Dawn though
[0:23:06] <mgod19> yeah those girls deserved it
[0:23:07] <primaryfire> kinda reminds me of mortal kombat's glorification of gore and how it caused the devs ptsd
[0:23:08] <stellaspeed10> I don't mind trans or gays. But when people have better unstanding on that then autism it's like REALLY
[0:23:11] <leith_aziz> I've not seen an Terentino movie
[0:23:12] <TheyCallMeVawn> Tarantino disrespecting Bruce Lee still fucks me up
[0:23:13] <+saltpiggu> the bruce lee thing made me uncomfortable even in the theater
[0:23:13] <iacus_> Oh I thought the QT question was the bait you were referrring to
[0:23:24] <%Lion_kun> What about Cliff's Wife?
[0:23:30] <die_hardman> But monster is in the eye of the beholder Kappa
[0:23:35] <%dds333a> @arnoldoaad1 plenty of people discussed this then. the "violence in videogames" discussion hasn't ended, and never will
[0:23:39] <+DukeBlack_> @stellaspeed10 it's really like what
[0:23:41] <@Solidus_113> about to go full joker
[0:23:42] <%X2Eliah> @TheyCallMeVawn man, his comments on the rogan podcast recently were... wild
[0:23:42] <%krispen_wa> why do i feel like tarantino is secretly part of the hollywood pedophile ring
[0:24:00] <iacus_> @TheyCallMeVawn what did he say?
[0:24:02] <%illtima> Those characters are written by PEOPLE lol
[0:24:05] <%LeeleeBB> @stellaspeed10 I'm sorry if ppl have made you feel that way, that sucks
[0:24:06] <Ids560> Oh baby the thermian argument
[0:24:07] <Trace_Bovier> what the heck did I miss
[0:24:09] <leith_aziz> In context, the Kratos thing I get. The TROPHY thing though is weird
[0:24:09] <%derap41> She's 500 years old I swear
[0:24:10] <+Bobbledygook> god can we just move on from this
[0:24:10] <tattleworm> WORDS AND DEEDS
[0:24:12] <%dds333a> Also, those girls in Death Proof didn't exactly deserve it, but boy was it great
[0:24:13] <@Menitta> I hope not because I really like those movies.
[0:24:18] <%mariothemaio> LUL the Quiet thing is so dumb
[0:24:18] <iacus_> @krispen_wa yeah, why do you feel that, I wonder...?
[0:24:28] <%chandlerofearth> @krispen_wa weinstein was his sugar daddy
[0:24:32] <%zanz_san> That waiter in Yakuza Kiwami knew they had guns in the back, he's not innocent.
[0:24:32] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:24:34] <%eanscrale> Remember Policenauts, Kojima is not as far away from that game as you would think,
[0:24:35] <Ecall10528> Can we just move on, bit is overdone, we get it.
[0:24:36] <%meniscate> Having sex refills your mana
[0:24:40] <%SuckerPunchSyd> He’s definitely part of the Hollywood foot ring if thats a thing
[0:24:42] <leith_aziz> Sometimes, if it serves a message, its fine. But what did Kratos killing that woman serve for a pourpose? We
[0:24:50] <leith_aziz> *We already knew Kratos is an ass
[0:24:55] <+Tuffty> Remember the game Hatred?
[0:24:58] <+mechslayer71> people make these things up, it didn't actually happen. so it's all arbitrary decisions, it's not deep
[0:24:58] <+elderpunch> the piss? hasSadge
[0:24:58] <mgod19> do what you want, but leave me out of it
[0:24:59] <leith_aziz> So that scene serves no pourpose
[0:25:01] <MrPedrovsky> @woolieversus lara croft fetish death animations
[0:25:02] <%derap41> You been watching Lindsay Ellis?
[0:25:03] <servicesuspension> let's get reeeeal close into the misery
[0:25:08] <+JustToWatch> wait are you trying to tell me that GOW3 wasn't an accurate depiction of actual historical events
[0:25:12] <KaitlynnHere> I like piss tho
[0:25:13] <%X2Eliah> @MrPedrovsky oh god so much this
[0:25:16] <+saltpiggu> It's the fact the the work would be completely unchanged plot wise if that didn't happen
[0:25:17] <Eger007> it does tho?
[0:25:20] <+TwitchZoomer2021> Honestly, I was surprised that Kratos kept her alive as long as he did, and didn't just immediately kill her.
[0:25:21] <notadeasterisk> no??
[0:25:22] <%holydeviant1> Cheevo is the problem
[0:25:23] <%Arnoldoaad1> @dds333a this is different than just violence in videogames, this is not Mortal Kombat/Night trap
[0:25:23] <pepinillomaton> Kratos is a shithead, so he does shitty things, but that was a bit extra
[0:25:32] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Woolies right
[0:25:38] <%AvroEltz> woolie, i don't think you need to explain any further, if people dont understand your point now, i don't think anything will make them
[0:25:39] <leith_aziz> @TwitchZoomer2021 SHe helped him get through the area. He just used her
[0:25:44] <%Seancicle> ハイハイ。アノダメデス。
[0:25:46] <+Exicuren> Like those super graphic Tomb Raider death animations
[0:25:46] <servicesuspension> PORTRAYAL, that's the word
[0:25:49] <%SuckerPunchSyd> The main problem comes from the action tied to the acheivement
[0:25:52] <servicesuspension> they way it's portrayed
[0:25:53] <%MightyDuckShoes> You will regret your words and deeds... now let's count ridges of Quiet's butthole in these loooong helicopter rides
[0:25:57] <asdief_> Doesn't kratos like destroy greece
[0:25:58] <%meniscate> Serbian Film, amirite?
[0:26:00] <%illtima> Just move on Woolie
[0:26:02] <+TwitchZoomer2021> @leith_aziz Oh, gotcha
[0:26:04] <@Solidus_113> the rotation begins again
[0:26:06] <%zanz_san> Even Tomino moved pass his violent phase with the help of his wife. like in Turn A Gundam.
[0:26:07] <primaryfire> justifying it is not as valuable as making a point about it but they aren't really doing that, it's gore for the sake of being edgy
[0:26:07] <TheyCallMeVawn> Next bit
[0:26:13] <+elderpunch> LUL LUL
[0:26:13] <leith_aziz> @asdief_ Yes. He destroyed the entire pantheon
[0:26:13] <Pt_Kamen> A hero should be the best of us, when they are a piece of shit that doesn't control their emotions is weird, why would you like him if he would love to kill you?
[0:26:14] <die_hardman> @mightyduckshoes being a teenager playing mgsv…
[0:26:15] <KaitlynnHere> Uh oh
[0:26:16] <zanzibarian_hamster> Please just move on, this is a rabbit hole with no bottom
[0:26:17] <+JustToWatch> but maybe the 9th time will get through to them
[0:26:22] <robert_orri> stunlocked
[0:26:35] <+LemonAgeKK> Camera definitely plays a huge role in context for that scene specifically
[0:26:35] <mgod19> "stop being fucked upped"
[0:26:39] <kinggum41> I have to use my own morals. I feel dirty otherwise
[0:26:40] <Ziegsy> Shock value I understand. Like the dude on the fence reveal in the first silent hill. But theres... Theres a line prolonged shock just makes you apathetic and it loses the point
[0:26:43] <Pt_Kamen> Unjustified Rage
[0:26:45] <%holydeviant1> @zanzibarian_hamster It loops! It just loops, man!
[0:26:52] <%Juriasu> why would you ever want to betray your morals, or even the morals of a character you are playing?
[0:26:53] <%krispen_wa> Are these discussions the true Woolie Hole?
[0:26:53] <Trace_Bovier> I'm just heading the Seagulls in the background lol
[0:26:53] <leith_aziz> We're not getting anywhere meaningfull with this conversation I feel. Like its too spicy
[0:26:54] <%dds333a> @arnoldoaad1 I said "violence in videogames" as a general example of the wider sexual portrayal, violence, content and whatnot that is stil lbeing discussed. it's been around since the 80s, and will continue to be.
[0:26:56] <%AvroEltz> i think its stuck in a loop
[0:26:59] <ulcaban> We're allowed to react in a particular way. We're allowed to have these questions about the brain that makes this art.
[0:27:00] <Ids560> Woole you should clearly just record yourself saying these things to play when you read the same arguments to save your own breath
[0:27:00] <AngryAsian5> This rabbit hole is quite deep
[0:27:02] <%Lion_kun> A lot of early Tomino stuff was horrible towards women.
[0:27:04] <+elderpunch> are we almost done streaming or
[0:27:07] <%X2Eliah> Some folks just pytting some low empathy 4chan opinions here
[0:27:08] <+askalta> were gonna have to pull the plug
[0:27:08] <Picia000123> it sounds like you are overthinking it at this point
[0:27:09] <+Bobbledygook> this isn't the disaster I wanted to see
[0:27:11] <+elderpunch> idk if i came in late
[0:27:15] <primaryfire> @elderpunch haven't started
[0:27:15] <%meniscate> Ethics and morality are complicated, huh? As if there should be some field of philosophy for it
[0:27:17] <Airtola> woolie u gotta relax on mental lmao
[0:27:18] <srv4254> never tap back in please
[0:27:21] <Savior127> So when are we getting into LISA: The Painful?
[0:27:21] <%MightyDuckShoes> @die_hardman lucky bastards...
[0:27:24] <pepinillomaton> Its ok Woolie, you explained yourself
[0:27:25] <KaitlynnHere> Tap out!
[0:27:26] <%holydeviant1> sure
[0:27:26] <%Arnoldoaad1> @dds333a this is closer to the same mentality that created stuff like The Guy Game, the slave scene on GoW wouldn't happen in the current time, that's what I mean that there has been a grown up
[0:27:27] <%AvroEltz> no you dont, people dont want to understand, ffs
[0:27:27] <Pt_Kamen> Reggie, quick, Activate the Litany of the Habs
[0:27:28] <+elderpunch> okay cool wooo
[0:27:29] <leith_aziz> It's fine Woolie
[0:27:30] <servicesuspension> now let's relax with something lighter... POLITICS
[0:27:32] <user_naim> We still in it? Just came back
[0:27:33] <mgod19> time to bow out gracefully
[0:27:36] <linSP> lmao lisa the painful
[0:27:36] <leith_aziz> I sympathise with how you feel
[0:27:37] <%khalcipher> No, you make sense to me too
[0:27:38] <%mariothemaio> @Savior127 oh god LUL
[0:27:39] <KaitlynnHere> Throw in the towel
[0:27:39] <%meniscate> Big overexplain
[0:27:41] <Trace_Bovier> what is everyone talking about?
[0:27:43] <%holydeviant1> Woolie has a bad habit of finding THOSE PEOPLE
[0:27:43] <%krispen_wa> Woolie take some magnesium, youre taking too much morale damage
[0:27:46] <mgod19> I disagree but I understand
[0:27:46] <%chandlerofearth> I feel woolie 100%
[0:27:46] <%X2Eliah> @WoolieVersus Woolie you are not wrong, just some creeps in chat today
[0:27:47] <%holydeviant1> It
[0:27:47] <+Archphronimos> it all makes sense to me
[0:27:47] <+saltpiggu> yeah its one of the worst things about Best Friends originally getting popular on 4chan
[0:27:50] <+I4gotmyname89> I appreciate your take
[0:27:52] <%Lion_kun> We always point out Sayla Mass or Emma Sheen and ignore the tons of women who get it bad in early Gundam.
[0:27:52] <KaiserMario> I agree with Woolie and I get it...
[0:27:53] <Picia000123> it's fine Woolie, people have different perspectives, it's fine
[0:27:53] <@Solidus_113> People will always play devil's advocate in debates
[0:27:53] <hekethe> Yes, most people understnd and agree
[0:27:53] <leith_aziz> It's fine to question. Let's just not make any takes
[0:27:55] <Pt_Kamen> We talking about dumping pucks
[0:28:00] <skyenoz> I mean maybe people just don't connect to what they see on screen and are just neutral to fucked up shit and are weirded out by people looking into it
[0:28:08] <%meniscate> WOOLIE I literally can't believe you love watching snuff videos.
[0:28:09] <%mariothemaio> let's talk about a game with no politics or meaning, like fallout new vegas :)
[0:28:14] <iacus_> Understanding your perspective, don't necessarily agree there's merit behind it wrt your particular argument
[0:28:16] <Airtola> @Solidus_113 theres devils advocate then theres just ignorance
[0:28:18] <sushahana> all smiles here :)
[0:28:19] <%eanscrale> Hey man that's cool and all, but is it making you cash money? I thought you were a REAL hustler?
[0:28:21] <+Mr_Pylon> weird creeps are wrong but also very loud so who knows?
[0:28:22] <leith_aziz> @skyenoz Maybe? That's still pretty effed up
[0:28:22] <+Tuffty> It's the Internet
[0:28:22] <%Arnoldoaad1> @dds333a and I get it, its not like it was completely acceptable before but right now its more publicly decryed, and I a good way
[0:28:23] <%holydeviant1> You have the opposite problem of Paige: she has people coming at her from nowhere, you somehow spot them from miles off
[0:28:23] <+LemonAgeKK> @WoolieVersus people have opinions and taste no one is wrong or right
[0:28:23] <Deko_> one guy will always exist
[0:28:29] <+Tuffty> ONE GUY
[0:28:33] <servicesuspension> ONE GUY
[0:28:34] <primaryfire> it's ok to not be a sociopath or give them time of day
[0:28:35] <%Mathochism> woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY
[0:28:38] <ulcaban> This requires specific language, like philosophical or psychological framing
[0:28:39] <%Vigonept> use kratos to kill that woman for the hustle woolie
[0:28:39] <%mariothemaio> woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY
[0:28:43] <mgod19> loop
[0:28:44] <%holydeviant1> woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY
[0:28:45] <%krispen_wa> Dont try to ONE GUY this chat. we are all ONE GUY
[0:28:46] <servicesuspension> ULTRALIBERAL
[0:28:47] <user_naim> Woolie vs Every Motherfucker
[0:28:47] <iacus_> @ulcaban Bingo
[0:28:48] <KaitlynnHere> One guy strikes again
[0:28:55] <dextralmalin> vortices, man
[0:28:57] <AngryAsian5> "Mister Evrart is helping me find my gun." LUL
[0:29:00] <mgod19> LUL
[0:29:01] <%holydeviant1> "Now let's play the Human Garbage game!"
[0:29:03] <%Javaa01> "Mr evrart is helming me find my gun"
[0:29:05] <%mariothemaio> time to kill klaasje for the loop ;)
[0:29:07] <Chatterbox1991> Woolie to himself: CORKSCREWBLOW
[0:29:08] <Pt_Kamen> Was it an IDIOT DOOM SPIRAL?
[0:29:08] <%meniscate> Uzumaki, amirite?
[0:29:15] <+VictorVonLouche> I mean why not have a deep convo on that random jobber in the corner you just popped in the head.
[0:29:19] <+PA_Raiden333> "Mr. Woolz is helping me find out what's messed up"
[0:29:19] <LlewynMarie> I get this so deeply.
[0:29:20] <ulcaban> Do you WANT to talk about this stuff, Woolie?
[0:29:20] <@Solidus_113> they don't think it be like it is, but it do
[0:29:21] <FassieFons> violence porn vs violence for exploration or catharsis
[0:29:23] <srv4254> people are shit stop dwelling
[0:29:24] <%dds333a> @arnoldoaad1 Not at all true, since games like this still wind up on stream. Rapelay was literal pornography, and yet people got up in arms about it. but yeah, people may not be as "okay" with it, but these products will still exist, and people will continue to discuss it
[0:29:24] <%Arnoldoaad1> ULTRA LIBERAL COMUNIST!
[0:29:31] <servicesuspension> okay that's cool, you do you. I'm just gonna... stand here... far away...
[0:29:36] <leith_aziz> That's just MK fatalities in a nutshell
[0:29:37] <+DukeBlack_> @lemonagekk that's not true at all
[0:29:38] <primaryfire> staying in my comfy motte
[0:29:49] <skyenoz> @leith_aziz I mean kinda? but some people just don't care if it's on screen and not real
[0:29:53] <balthazar758> crypto mode
[0:29:55] <+mechslayer71> most right wing people
[0:29:56] <%krispen_wa> We live in a SOCIETY
[0:29:57] <%zanz_san> Totally
[0:29:59] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> bad actors? @woolieversus
[0:29:59] <ulcaban> Morpheus voice- 'Its like a splinter in your mind'
[0:29:59] <Pt_Kamen> it's called BAIT
[0:30:00] <%Juriasu> this is why I can't even be bothered to discuss things
[0:30:04] <servicesuspension> the ethical freedom to be a total psycho
[0:30:09] <+elderpunch> woolie has been watching vaush LUL
[0:30:10] <%derap41> "thugs"
[0:30:11] <+elderpunch> or destiny
[0:30:13] <%krispen_wa> Pale? Dark Matter?
[0:30:16] <user_naim> Cryptohornytologist
[0:30:20] <leith_aziz> @skyenoz You mean because it's fiction, no? That's how some people would justify it, but I dont know...
[0:30:24] <asdief_> "Traditional" values
[0:30:28] <%meniscate> Completely seriously @woolieversus hat about killing animals for food? Isn't it also for entertainment since most people in the West don't need animals to live?
[0:30:34] <+Mr_Pylon> What if we called it traditionalism instead?
[0:30:36] <%krispen_wa> THIS CANNOT CONTINUE
[0:30:41] <srv4254> go talk to big union guy now for pallet cleanse
[0:30:42] <%MightyDuckShoes> It's the kink equivalent of the light bending man
[0:30:46] <hekethe> And if you call out not arguing in good faith they always turn it on you
[0:30:46] <Pt_Kamen> now put on the funny tie
[0:30:54] <heemwizard> @Pt_Kamen tie no work
[0:30:54] <OblivionSword1> no kim day today
[0:30:55] <Pt_Kamen> BRATAN!
[0:31:02] <+VictorVonLouche> Too late for tie, tie is dead.
[0:31:04] <servicesuspension> the tie's not gonna work anymore if you lose the first check, stop talking about the tie
[0:31:18] <%Lion_kun> Woolie. Read books and waste the day and get Kim back.
[0:31:23] <notadeasterisk> racist driver time?
[0:31:26] <%krispen_wa> The tie isnt real. it wasnt your fault. the accident happened years ago. you have to move on
[0:31:31] <%hax_metatron> Kimless
[0:31:32] <%mariothemaio> they are gone :(
[0:31:32] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1412666647689764864?s=19
[0:31:33] <+Tuffty> That net worth tho
[0:31:38] <dextralmalin> oh snap, you arrested them?
[0:31:40] <Pt_Kamen> racist driver needs Kim
[0:31:41] <%Arnoldoaad1> @dds333a absolutely, this will continue to exist, no question about it because there is a market/audience for it, but they arent mainstream as like GoW was and probably wont ever reach that level of notoriety
[0:31:41] <AngryAsian5> KIM BibleThump
[0:31:50] <iacus_> miss Kim alrady
[0:31:51] <+TwitchZoomer2021> Hell yeah
[0:31:52] <Picia000123> @dextralmalin yup, bye Klaasje
[0:31:57] <%AvroEltz> time for DRUGS AND ALCOHOL
[0:31:57] <+mechslayer71> you never asked her about Sunday BTW
[0:32:05] <%Juriasu> doing things without Kim is not that big of a deal imo, unless you want to do something you really want to see his reaction too
[0:32:07] <%Vigonept> the armor?
[0:32:07] <$tallik44123> OH nO this can only end well
[0:32:10] <%hax_metatron> This is fun to do alone because you get to gloat to Kim about it later!
[0:32:13] <%krispen_wa> man, is there anything to so now without Kim
[0:32:13] <dextralmalin> Guess I'll wait for the anime release
[0:32:16] <notadeasterisk> titus should be happy, miss disco dancer is gone
[0:32:19] <%khalcipher> Nice
[0:32:23] <+askalta> i love the vis check music

[0:32:49] <zanzibarian_hamster> Is that classy on the bottom?
[0:32:53] <servicesuspension> wait, the bed's next to the stairs? that's bad feng shui!
[0:32:55] <%Javaa01> Visual Calculus seems to think showing the dude's O-face is *very* important
[0:33:00] <+TheLastStar> the face in the red LUL
[0:33:00] <iacus_> you get that overlay of martinaise
[0:33:08] <%krispen_wa> Klaasje is a hardcore bottom M

[0:34:22] <%krispen_wa> that asshole didnt deserve such a good death

[0:35:22] <%hax_metatron> You get to tell Kim you deduced it
[0:35:22] <%krispen_wa> its a shame when kim is not here, period.
[0:35:37] <%krispen_wa> except for giving cocaine to a 12 year old
[0:35:50] <%AvroEltz> or really lucky
[0:35:54] <user_naim> Yoshikage Kira with a bubble blaster
[0:36:22] <heemwizard> Yes
[0:36:24] <%Juriasu> yes we should
[0:36:29] <%Vigonept> Yes
[0:36:30] <%holydeviant1> Visual Calc is fucking baller
[0:36:30] <AngryAsian5> Yes
[0:36:31] <iacus_> extrapolate
[0:36:34] <%Juriasu> LUL
[0:36:37] <Project205> why not?
[0:36:40] <+Tuffty> One shot, one kill

[0:37:35] <balthazar758> mgs duel theme plays
[0:37:41] <user_naim> Change the PS2 system clock by a week to beat the game
[0:37:50] <%X2Eliah> I didn't catch that the rad bg was the map
[0:37:53] <%X2Eliah> red*
[0:38:09] <+TheLastStar> LUL
[0:38:15] <heemwizard> triple prime
[0:38:19] <%Juriasu> Morgan Freeman could be the killer
[0:38:25] <+NopeBadguy> @WoolieVersus Single prime, double prime, and triple prime
[0:38:27] <servicesuspension> Double Yefreitor Powers
[0:38:34] <dreamfillah> THE COIN-OPERATOR
[0:38:34] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:38:37] <Hammatime8> Were they any witnesses that heard a "Mom, get the camera"?
[0:39:04] <Prevot> maybe the shooter bounced the bullet on a Col Do Ma Ma Daqua
[0:39:26] <+NopeBadguy> Well, remember these are guesses, not rolls
[0:39:33] <%hax_metatron> ESPRIT KIM
[0:39:34] <KaitlynnHere> You just gotta follow the trail of Red Bull’s and empty Doritos bags to find your shooter
[0:39:34] <asdief_> Man the VA is great
[0:39:35] <%mariothemaio> EDC :(
[0:39:35] <+Tuffty> Sniper just put on the right clothes before making the shot
[0:39:37] <%X2Eliah> and the inverse, 72%, is very often a failed roll
[0:39:39] <%krispen_wa> Maybe the Mercenary shot the bullet BACKWARDS from his head INTO the bay
[0:39:41] <%AvroEltz> did the killer get a 12 or not klaasje?
[0:39:50] <iacus_> these are likelyhoods
[0:39:51] <%chandlerofearth> esprit like "I'll be kim for you"
[0:39:53] <dreamfillah> Damn, cool. Esprit comes to stand in for Kim if it's high enough?
[0:39:53] <%BisoromiBear> Black Zetsu did it
[0:39:54] <+yusefHD> SF3 Audio: YEA THAT MAKES SENSE
[0:39:55] <%Dapper_Cactuar> god the visual calculus stat in this game is so cool
[0:40:08] <hekethe> Vis calc gave 3% for B'', which is a critical success in game
[0:40:13] <%krispen_wa> DONT SING
[0:40:14] <Blank9> nah, just sing in the morning tomorrow
[0:40:14] <%mariothemaio> dont sing without him

[0:40:19] <%holydeviant1> Kim's input is important
[0:40:19] <+Afrobrawler> wait for kim to sing
[0:40:20] <primaryfire> kim NEEDS to hear
[0:40:20] <%chandlerofearth> wait for him to sing
[0:40:22] <servicesuspension> better to wait for him, his reaction's cool
[0:40:23] <+dalmek> @krispen_wa it didn't go all the way through, so it's more likely he shot it through the window and it did a U-turn back into his mouth
[0:40:24] <dewwy125> wait for kim to sing
[0:40:29] <%Lion_kun> NOOOO
[0:40:30] <notadeasterisk> maybe *they* used little powder

[0:40:51] <guiltyboya> singo with kimo
[0:40:56] <Project205> Try getting rid of the Expression?
[0:41:01] <heemwizard> you could do the cryptozoologist first or the church
[0:41:03] <die_hardman> @notadeasterisk harder without kim
[0:41:05] <+yusefHD> Cafeteria theme ayee
[0:41:06] <primaryfire> just gotta figure out what you wanna risk without kim
[0:41:07] <%Lion_kun> Crypto is fine without Kim
[0:41:08] <%mariothemaio> talk to titus
[0:41:10] <servicesuspension> do the police guys here have something new?
[0:41:11] <%krispen_wa> he needs to pay for a room to rid the expression
[0:41:13] <FassieFons> sing AT night, sing WITH a crowd, sing FOR kim
[0:41:26] <%purps26> you could buy more books if you don't want to do anything without Kim
[0:41:26] <heemwizard> @servicesuspension should have something new
[0:41:27] <skyenoz> Definitely save the church for kim
[0:41:28] <guiltyboya> Try getting rid of the expression, maybe ?
[0:41:28] <heemwizard> i think
[0:41:41] <%chandlerofearth> you can forge the signatures to sabotage evrart's plan and still progress
[0:41:43] <%krispen_wa> I thought that said inspect klaasje's body. i wanna inspect her body
[0:41:43] <%X2Eliah> could do a lot pf reading and sleeping
[0:41:49] <%Juriasu> yes you are
[0:41:49] <%hax_metatron> No this is good
[0:41:54] <%hax_metatron> Good to see the game from this angle
[0:41:56] <heemwizard> better do the crypto without kim lol
[0:41:56] <die_hardman> @yusefhd this is my fav version of it
[0:41:57] <servicesuspension> yeah it's no prob
[0:41:59] <primaryfire> there's an npc at the FELD building who leaves in the evening that is fine without kim
[0:42:24] <dreamfillah> titus RESPECTS THE SIGMA energy
[0:42:25] <user_naim> Could go after the armor, do some reading
[0:42:27] <%krispen_wa> Titus is MEGA compromised

[0:42:36] <dewwy125> milky
[0:42:40] <+NopeBadguy> god i hate these guys
[0:42:42] <zanzibarian_hamster> Who ISN'T compromised?
[0:42:46] <TheD3rp416> I accidentally discovered a pseudo-exploit on my first playthrough of the game: if you open the clipboard compartment while Kim's gone he comes back immediately
[0:42:57] <Prevot> stop simping titus
[0:43:02] <dreamfillah> lamBH
[0:43:09] <%krispen_wa> I wanna be compromised by klaasje
[0:43:10] <heemwizard> sunboy lol

[0:43:37] <%krispen_wa> APOCOP!
[0:43:39] <user_naim> Man I never saw that Sunboy line. That’s really funny

[0:44:01] <iacus_> it's established he doesn't need to simp. in character and plot tho
[0:44:16] <dewwy125> i didnt arrest her because that would mean giving her to the moralintern fuck those guys
[0:44:26] <Picia000123> Volition would NEVER fuck up :)
[0:44:28] <+ConLin_Arts_> NotLikeThis
[0:44:32] <asdief_> the moral intern wouldn't do anything immoral Kappa

[0:44:49] <$Combat_Data> Oh it seems wild to know about Ruby already since i've only been watching the anime
[0:44:51] <%krispen_wa> Volition is a big fraud who pretends to be reasonable but is in fact a big bitch
[0:44:56] <FassieFons> volition didn't say arrest her
[0:45:17] <%mariothemaio> daaang shanky

[0:47:10] <%krispen_wa> MAN, WHY DID THEY ARREST KLAASJE
[0:47:14] <luftraumm1> wait for kim
[0:47:14] <+NopeBadguy> @dewwy125 Perception has passive checks associated in the overworld that you need a certain amount to even interact with, like thought bubbles
[0:47:15] <$Combat_Data> Wait for KIM
[0:47:16] <iacus_> technically you can pass the test earlier but it's harder
[0:47:23] <%meniscate> @combat_data nah there's a -10
[0:47:24] <RENTARIM> yeah kim not here so it's useless
[0:47:28] <luftraumm1> wait for kim for God's sake
[0:47:29] <dewwy125> @NopeBadguy thats sick i never knew that
[0:47:42] <%mariothemaio> shouldn't have arrested klaasje :(
[0:47:53] <heemwizard> @mariothemaio it was a right thing to do
[0:48:00] <Paragon_of_Laziness> I mean, she did lie to the cops
[0:48:06] <%krispen_wa> Why does it look like Reggie's wearing Vergil's outfit
[0:48:09] <%hax_metatron> BIG DICK
[0:48:10] <luftraumm1> arresting klaasje is a bad call by volition
[0:48:10] <$Combat_Data> All yellow containers are perception finds, I think

[0:49:13] <primaryfire> don't follow up on this key without kim
[0:49:15] <luftraumm1> @mariothemaio arguably, personally I think that knowing that her destiny is dire makes arresting her excessively cruel
[0:49:15] <d41caesar> Really recommend waiting for Kim and exploring the coast instead
[0:49:15] <Eger007> wait for kim
[0:49:17] <%SomeAsianDood> Wait for kim for this
[0:49:20] <Blank9> oh come on

[0:50:33] <%vaderxyz1970> it's fine to look at the door

[0:52:26] <homelessproperty> You could by some books, you have the money for it
[0:52:28] <MrPedrovsky> @woolieversus you can always just dick around on the coast
[0:52:36] <%DraculersRevenge> all these backseaters who've never even played the game telling The Boys what to do atpCap
[0:52:37] <servicesuspension> he bought all the books already
[0:52:37] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:52:38] <heemwizard> @mariothemaio that IS possible actually
[0:52:40] <homelessproperty> read some books imo
[0:52:43] <%hax_metatron> Woolie completely being honest, anything you would miss with Kim in the minor settings, you can get them again when he comes back. Feel free to move along
[0:52:48] <JetpackMcQuack> Life goes on without Kim
[0:52:48] <%krispen_wa> Sing Karaoke, open the door, finish the Church quest, and enter the final area without kim
[0:52:52] <Pt_Kamen> should buy the Wiral set
[0:52:54] <+Tuffty> Kim comes back to see the case solved and the perp arrested
[0:52:58] <hekethe> Kimless playthrough is better anyway, for Revakol
[0:53:03] <notadeasterisk> didn't you lose a dice?
[0:53:04] <guanglai__kangyi> You can forge the documents
[0:53:06] <servicesuspension> give her exposure
[0:53:30] <skyenoz> yeah main story stuff and big side quests are better with Kim but anything else is fair game
[0:53:31] <akajaybay> I think the dice are mostly to unlock failed checks
[0:53:35] <%SomeAsianDood> try to pay for the dice with net worth Kappa i'll go great
[0:53:45] <%krispen_wa> Dicemaker's theme Kreygasm
[0:53:49] <heemwizard> its magnet
[0:53:51] <%mariothemaio> PAY MONEY? FOR GOODS?
[0:53:53] <heemwizard> made from pale

[0:54:32] <Savior127> I know some people have done Maxed Out Skills run but has anyone done Zero Sum Skills run?
[0:54:33] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> they're just magnetic iirc
[0:54:35] <jigglepants> What did the lads do so far
[0:54:36] <+ppangboi> I think the space rock dice are even more espensive
[0:54:44] <heemwizard> @Proxzo benefits of being an ultraliberal
[0:54:46] <%krispen_wa> the lads fought chat over a door key
[0:54:50] <Zomner> d100 fucking sucks
[0:55:02] <Blank9> yeah who on earth wants a d100
[0:55:02] <%mariothemaio> tbh that's a really nice set for only 10 bucks
[0:55:10] <Zomner> at least a single d100 die, the d100 mechanism is fine
[0:55:11] <guiltyboya> d100 rules
[0:55:11] <Blank9> just roll 2 d10s
[0:55:14] <shincadad> Why don’t you try tonforge the signatures in your shack?
[0:55:32] <%krispen_wa> isnt the sleeping dockworker only day 1?
[0:55:33] <+mechslayer71> what do the dice do anyway?
[0:55:33] <%hax_metatron> DO DATE!
[0:55:38] <Zomner> the d100 is just a ball that will just keep rolling until you stop it
[0:55:40] <%AvroEltz> try your luck with a date
[0:55:40] <jigglepants> @krispen_wa to the one in the whirling in rags?
[0:55:45] <%krispen_wa> YOU CAN DATE SWORD GIRL NOW
[0:55:54] <+illusiveSaint> some of the checks are bugs that have been done

[0:55:58] <+Sir_Louis> that's for shaving
[0:55:59] <%krispen_wa> yeah the whirling drunk
[0:56:02] <killaholic89> there is dating mechanics in this game?
[0:56:03] <user_naim> So is a critical success 1/10000 with those?
[0:56:09] <%purps26> That map wall check was to steal the map. you already bought it so you can't do that one. it's a bug i think
[0:56:09] <ZedDriftwood> wash basin is old lady outside
[0:56:14] <Chatterbox1991> Also the Mirror with the Expression
[0:56:16] <MrPedrovsky> @woolieversus YEYEYEYEYE SWORD GIRL. NO KIM.
[0:56:18] <%Arnoldoaad1> Weird thing about this is that it shows stuff that you don't need to do anymore, like if you need to open a door by force as a white check, it still will show it even if you already open the door with the key
[0:56:22] <+mechslayer71> @killaholic89 it's a platonic outing, no romance
[0:56:27] <Zomner> @MrPedrovsky good idea
[0:56:45] <heemwizard> stronger prybar
[0:56:48] <guiltyboya> Platonic romance
[0:56:49] <%doomerskeletor13> How far are they? What’s the last main case thing they did?

[0:57:31] <heemwizard> talk to the cops
[0:57:31] <shincadad> Maybe try to stop the expression?

[0:57:59] <die_hardman> Drunk is day 1
[0:57:59] <jigglepants> still can't believe he called horse faced
[0:58:02] <Ids560> he's a day 1 thing to ignore measurehead
[0:58:06] <$Combat_Data> Didn't he have a keycard?
[0:58:13] <%doomerskeletor13> It’s not very important either way
[0:58:19] <user_naim> list of checks sometimes include checks that are gone
[0:58:23] <+askalta> did he meet Gary

[1:03:53] <jigglepants> so is harry
[1:03:57] <$Combat_Data> This is one of those bits of the game that just doesn't feel like it belongs once your detective has things more under control
[1:03:58] <+airchrysalis> did he talk to judit
[1:04:02] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> basically lol

[1:04:10] <%Arnoldoaad1> spoiler: neither
[1:04:14] <heysamuel> he has his reasons for being like that
[1:04:15] <+illusiveSaint> is woolie saying he worked with people like him or sound like him with the accent?
[1:04:16] <guiltyboya> The energy is being scrambled by that beautiful wig of his
[1:04:19] <dukenux> Hes there to be sure youre not fuckin with someone
[1:04:20] <iacus_> yeah it feels a bit forced but maybe that's the port
[1:04:20] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> to be fair, talking to Harry when you were a part of his past must be the ultimate, "talking to a wall" experience
[1:04:22] <%SomeAsianDood> both @illusiveSaint
[1:04:23] <iacus_> point*
[1:04:26] <ulcaban> He's worried in that way that makes people act like a dick

[1:05:26] <die_hardman> Time to rip the twitch video to YouTube.
[1:05:33] <Prevot> DarkMode this software is down with the devil
[1:05:34] <Blank9> reaper is a better audio program to use
[1:05:34] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> DARK Audacity

[1:06:06] <%sahr_zand> To Russia, and to anyone who's paying
[1:06:06] <servicesuspension> dark audacity is sponsored by the dark olympics
[1:06:06] <%meniscate> Microsoft does the same meh
[1:06:15] <%Juriasu> Putin won't be able to watch the streams anymore now the Woolie is using Dark Audacity
[1:06:24] <mgod19> good thing I never update audacity
[1:06:25] <skyenoz> Dark Audacity fucking killed pat
[1:06:27] <+illusiveSaint> we're being bullied by Russia's cyber crimes and we're doing nothing LUL
[1:06:27] <%X2Eliah> so where does dark audacity send info to?
[1:06:34] <notadeasterisk> just block audacity in the firewall
[1:06:37] <Zomner> oof
[1:06:39] <iacus_> casual reminder that the "audacity spyware" rumor has been blown up, and is inaccurate
[1:06:39] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:06:40] <%krispen_wa> OOF
[1:06:43] <BlackermanZX> i blocked audacity with the firewall immediately
[1:06:43] <+Jeshk0> Putin is missing out on GREAT content
[1:06:48] <$Combat_Data> I was wondering why there was no podcast
[1:06:55] <%krispen_wa> @iacus_ begone, Russian spy bot
[1:07:03] <drunken_lemur> Wait, what just happened?
[1:07:06] <asdief_> I wonder if putin likes elfen lied
[1:07:11] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> how DARE you not want your info being sold to 3rd parties
[1:07:14] <Josef_Stryker> It's too much work tho
[1:07:17] <heemwizard> no reason to open that again
[1:07:19] <dukenux> thats future Woolie's problem
[1:07:22] <Josef_Stryker> Kappa
[1:07:25] <heemwizard> i think thats opening it
[1:07:29] <heemwizard> you already it
[1:07:30] <notadeasterisk> needed to be locked
[1:07:35] <KaitlynnHere> @asdief_ oh he’d love that shit… or he’d say something like “that’s not realistic enough”
[1:07:36] <%cobalt_phoenix_> again, some are going to stay on the map even if you can't do them
[1:07:37] <heemwizard> *did it
[1:07:37] <%X2Eliah> @WoolieVersus Some of those checks are bugged, already done ages ago
[1:07:50] <Deasmeister> You opened it already
[1:07:51] <die_hardman> U opened it @woolieversus . This game is just fucked.
[1:07:52] <+Jeshk0> you unlocked it, so it still shows the "missed" checl
[1:07:55] <$Combat_Data> Checks you sidestepped stay there
[1:07:55] <+Jeshk0> check
[1:07:57] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @woolieversus some checks are bugged
[1:07:58] <skyenoz> It's already passed
[1:08:03] <hekethe> That's a leftover since you used the key
[1:08:05] <%chandlerofearth> they're alternative paths you didn't take
[1:08:06] <%purps26> You aren't misreading. it doesn't remove things that aren't available anymore
[1:08:13] <%purps26> it sucks
[1:08:19] <shincadad> Why don’t you try to stop the expression?
[1:08:20] <notadeasterisk> you can explore the coast
[1:08:21] <Deasmeister> You unlocked it instead of crowbaring it
[1:08:22] <%doomerskeletor13> You got the key instead of forcing it open, so the check didn’t pop
[1:08:22] <+Jeshk0> the list is still good, except for a couple checks you got around
[1:08:22] <TheD3rp416> isn't there the check with Anne in front of the book store?
[1:08:23] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> legit issue with the game sadly

[2:06:47] <zanzibarian_hamster> The guy is a vagrant, his signiatrue aint worth shit, go for it
[2:06:52] <%CappuccinoGuil> We told you to reload, WE TOLD YOU
[2:06:53] <%Gruhunchously> Coward
[2:07:01] <%Gruhunchously> What kind of ultra-liberal are you?
[2:07:02] <Miklosher> his signature will not have any legal power
[2:07:03] <+mechslayer71> nope
[2:07:05] <+MrATheGreat> maybe
[2:07:06] <ariszed> they're homeless
[2:07:06] <%meniscate> Woolie big no remember
[2:07:06] <+ConLin_Arts_> they are not residents
[2:07:07] <KaitlynnHere> But now you have to!
[2:07:08] <iacus_> get invalid signatures
[2:07:08] <+illusiveSaint> it's not getting bulldozed it's next door

[2:07:14] <%Vigonept> AGREEABLE? WITH EVERATT?
[2:07:16] <%doomerskeletor13> These guys are not the residents
[2:07:16] <+ConLin_Arts_> he wanted specific people to sign
[2:07:16] <%hax_metatron> Nothing stops you from it
[2:07:18] <%AvroEltz> WOOLIE, his name is not in the document
[2:07:18] <+Bitscreed> IDS and friends aren't the ones with their names on the documents.
[2:07:19] <Fuji808> Ask yourself, who needs to sign?
[2:07:20] <RENTARIM> If they sign it it does not count
[2:07:21] <KaitlynnHere> No signatures= no gun
[2:07:21] <user_naim> The wrong signatures are invalid
[2:07:21] <die_hardman> It’s too late @woolieversus
[2:07:23] <hekethe> What's this about bulldozing the village?
[2:07:24] <%CappuccinoGuil> Woolie, is that an ACTUAL question or are you talking to yourself?
[2:07:24] <servicesuspension> are these guys even residents
[2:07:25] <+MrATheGreat> @WoolieVersus Are you seriously asking for spoilers because I cangive you answers
[2:07:25] <Deasmeister> These guys are not who are supposed to sign it
[2:07:26] <shincadad> The signature is supposed to be for Lilienne and Isobel, bot the,
[2:07:26] <%X2Eliah> @WoolieVersus Woolie these are hobos not villagers
[2:07:27] <%SomeAsianDood> he wants specific people woolie
[2:07:27] <ingman112> IDS is not one of the two
[2:07:30] <%AvroEltz> THEY ARE NOT VILLAGERS
[2:07:30] <Stheeo> this means forging the signature, they are not the ones supposed to sign it
[2:07:32] <+ConLin_Arts_> he wanted the ladies to sign
[2:07:34] <%doomerskeletor13> He wanted Liliene and the old woman to sign it
[2:07:34] <heemwizard> they really overthink this stuff
[2:07:35] <ingman112> IDS signing counts as forgery
[2:07:39] <user_naim> This is an alternative to forging
[2:07:40] <asdief_> evict these children so that you can build a youth center
[2:07:40] <zanzibarian_hamster> VAGRANTS DONT COUNT
[2:07:44] <die_hardman> You are overthinking @woolieversus
[2:07:45] <primaryfire> not quite bulldozing, it's 12-24 months of unbearable construction noise
[2:07:46] <%chandlerofearth> you can get lilly to sign than forge another, right?
[2:07:46] <+ConLin_Arts_> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[2:07:46] <shincadad> Frustration...
[2:07:47] <Picia000123> Woolie thinks way too hard
[2:07:48] <Chatterbox1991> @WoolieVersus he asked for very specific names to sign it (people other than Doom Spiral)
[2:07:48] <TheD3rp416> read the description of the letter
[2:07:50] <Zomner> read the description
[2:07:53] <+Afrobrawler> Hey think about it idiot doom spiral is a interesting name
[2:07:54] <user_naim> As they want two specific names
[2:07:54] <Inqy833> I don’t think a document signed IDIOT DOOM SPIRAL will carry much weight in court
[2:08:03] <OblivionSword1> Woolie do you remember whose signature evrart needs ?
[2:08:09] <skyenoz> like is a homeless person considered a "resident" of a place
[2:08:09] <shincadad> Oh my fucking god
[2:08:16] <Dopamien> This is highlighted text, please read this because it's very important.
[2:08:17] <%Vigonept> it needs thw grann and lily remember?
[2:08:18] <%meniscate> Woolie
[2:08:20] <+ConLin_Arts_> NotLikeThis
[2:08:25] <+illusiveSaint> you have to convince both women to sign it @woolieversus

[2:08:40] <marcomatame> Chat's melting in anger at Woolie's gigabrain

[2:08:53] <servicesuspension> did Woolie fuck up the forgery?
[2:08:53] <ingman112> Evrart needs the two women to sign it. If IDS signs it the document wil be invalid
[2:08:55] <%CappuccinoGuil> The bus is NEVER quiet
[2:09:00] <%X2Eliah> @servicesuspension yes

[2:09:14] <servicesuspension> ohhh motorway south
[2:09:17] <%MightyDuckShoes> So he wants the village to get bulldozed then?
[2:09:24] <%SomeAsianDood> this is just the dice check again LUL
[2:09:25] <Chatterbox1991> If you get other people to sign it the document will be invalidated and Evrart won't know until it's too late

[2:10:01] <%CappuccinoGuil> OH MOTORISTA, PODE CORRER!
[2:10:03] <+mechslayer71> VERY meh
[2:10:13] <%CappuccinoGuil> We never quiet down on the bus Kappa
[2:10:13] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:10:14] <%X2Eliah> meh
[2:10:18] <marcomatame> @Chatterbox1991 tbh, i'm with Woolie on this one, letting the bums sign it for it to be invalidated never occurred to me
[2:10:39] <LlewynMarie> Oh Harry
[2:10:39] <marcomatame> i just never signed it with anyone
[2:10:42] <+Jeshk0> i didnt know the bums signing it was an option
[2:10:43] <servicesuspension> so...
[2:10:45] <%CappuccinoGuil> OH, THE ANDRE CHECK
[2:10:46] <leomuratore> Damn.
[2:11:02] <JetpackMcQuack> Speedrun tech
[2:11:02] <+mechslayer71> Andre in the tent tho @woolieversus
[2:11:06] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> I looked up all the thought outcomes because I'm a CHEATER
[2:11:08] <OblivionSword1> that's one way to do it
[2:11:11] <servicesuspension> Harry is basically thinking about dissapearing. Like, literally
[2:11:11] <+Mr_Pylon> once you know, the powergaming is very strong
[2:11:20] <+mechslayer71> @spudnacious_dynasty same
[2:11:22] <JetpackMcQuack> Or, get lucky
[2:11:29] <%X2Eliah> @WoolieVersus Yeah if you previously know its gonna pop them
[2:11:34] <%purps26> Or, always be doing white checks even if they are unlikely. Since you will get refreshes at certain point
[2:11:34] <%livlinn> !uptime
[2:11:35] <@Moobot> @livlinn WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 39 minutes
[2:11:38] <%CappuccinoGuil> +1 inland is nice
[2:11:54] <shincadad> Woolie, read the signature quest description
[2:11:59] <%meniscate> WHITE MOURNING
[2:11:59] <%CappuccinoGuil> I'd like Motorway South more if it was +1 inland and +1 something else, or +2 inland
[2:12:01] <Blank9> it's a free +1
[2:12:01] <%purps26> you don't really need more money
[2:12:04] <BlackermanZX> is the white mourning stuff still bugged
[2:12:04] <mcfearless06> mcfearless06 subscribed at Tier 1. 
[2:12:13] <servicesuspension> it's mostly just cash and drugs
[2:12:14] <%X2Eliah> @WoolieVersus How many locked containers did you have so far? Like 1?
[2:12:15] <dewwy125> its just real and your a high net worth individual
[2:12:17] <%purps26> better loot I think just means more tare
[2:12:19] <%derap41> do you need more cash?
[2:12:20] <+PA_Raiden333> oh no, Schrodinger's Megaelixir
[2:12:21] <iambqb> 99 Elixers at the end of the game
[2:12:22] <%CappuccinoGuil> @Blank9 Not really, because it costs 1 point, so it's not a gain.
[2:12:24] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Does Jamrock shuffle give any clothes? Or just cash?
[2:12:28] <%hax_metatron> Not very bugged
[2:12:33] <die_hardman> @woolieversus keep in mind, certain thoughts give bonuses to checks
[2:12:34] <%hax_metatron> A reset / reload fixes it
[2:12:34] <$Combat_Data> 15th tribe is small money now and you got most of the green bubbles
[2:12:35] <%mcfearless06> hey Woolie and chat
[2:12:35] <luftraumm1> do you want to know if jamrock shuffle pays out?
[2:12:37] <%meniscate> It causes a bug in a future sidequest
[2:12:40] <%Gruhunchously> They say White Mourning causes issues with certain cutscenes
[2:12:44] <skyenoz> But you're already fairly well off
[2:12:52] <servicesuspension> what does jamais vu do
[2:12:53] <Blank9> @Blank9 He already spent the 1 for the cabinet space, now it'd be spending a level to get rid of something with no drawbacks lol
[2:12:53] <%kyh9> Boost Shivers
[2:12:54] <heemwizard> does it?
[2:12:58] <heemwizard> source?
[2:13:03] <%SomeAsianDood> yeah if u zoom too far out it will bug out. just don't zoom out too far
[2:13:03] <Zomner> real?
[2:13:04] <%CappuccinoGuil> @servicesuspension Jamais vu gives you XP, I believe
[2:13:08] <Eger007> sounds like bs to me
[2:13:10] <%meniscate> It is true
[2:13:10] <tattleworm> i played through with it and had no problems
[2:13:12] <+MrATheGreat> What does?
[2:13:17] <%derap41> Its a bug it might and might not happen
[2:13:20] <%AvroEltz> i know about a cutscene bug, not sure if it is related to white mourning
[2:13:20] <notadeasterisk> just save regularly and if it happens just remove it
[2:13:21] <lksrkson> the thing didn't happen to me a week ago
[2:13:21] <die_hardman> Which side quest guys? Give hint, no spoiler.
[2:13:24] <%meniscate> It glitches the church quest
[2:13:24] <linSP> I mean visual bugs don’t break the game right
[2:13:25] <Chatterbox1991> Why would it be a lie?
[2:13:27] <%hax_metatron> They addressed it in a recent patch, you can always forget it if you keep having issues; reload also fixes it.
[2:13:39] <heemwizard> @meniscate thats because of graphical settings
[2:13:42] <%meniscate> Causes the game to freeze during the church quest
[2:13:50] <heemwizard> not the thought
[2:13:54] <%mcfearless06> Just finished your Kotor 2 play on youtube. glad to catch you live
[2:14:04] <heemwizard> i know i encountered the bug
[2:14:04] <%krispen_wa> imagine thinking 5 is a high stat
[2:14:15] <%meniscate> It's just a zoom out anyways. It's nothing
[2:14:15] <heemwizard> just change the shader settings
[2:14:41] <servicesuspension> sometimes you might have to just take a gamble and forget something important to get lore
[2:14:58] <%derap41> Its not wasted
[2:15:06] <servicesuspension> Xp is plenty, like ridiculously so
[2:15:08] <primaryfire> getting every thought is pretty rough for the stats tbh
[2:15:10] <%hax_metatron> Nothing's wasted, it's hard to "lose" or get a bad experience in this game because of leveling issues
[2:15:15] <%CappuccinoGuil> Pretty sure Jamrock just increases money gained, but it's not all that great. There're better thoughts for money gain.
[2:15:15] <Zomner> PogChamp
[2:15:18] <+Jeshk0> gimme dat sandwich old man!!
[2:15:18] <+MrATheGreat> YEYEYEY SANDWICh
[2:15:20] <%cobalt_phoenix_> lol sandwich
[2:15:22] <iacus_> only now I realize his name is gAston Martin
[2:15:25] <Zomner> go see the statue?
[2:15:29] <Picia000123> bump that composure and get that little girl off the streets
[2:15:42] <die_hardman> @woolieversus talk to the old man?
[2:15:42] <Dopamien> moon2PREGARIO
[2:15:45] <%SomeAsianDood> say one of these political things or fuck off
[2:16:05] <Chatterbox1991> yeeeees
[2:16:21] <Blank9> I mean, what's stopping evrart from just forging his own signatures
[2:16:23] <servicesuspension> is the youth center from evrart the same one from the rich guy
[2:16:27] <%derap41> then no gun help
[2:16:28] <+mechslayer71> that version is the no gun version
[2:16:39] <ingman112> @servicesuspension That’s where Harry’s idea came from
[2:17:01] <%CappuccinoGuil> LUL
[2:17:08] <servicesuspension> I love when little details carry onward
[2:17:11] <JetpackMcQuack> do another
[2:17:11] <iacus_> you got lillienne to sign? OMG
[2:17:12] <%CappuccinoGuil> HUH????
[2:17:13] <%mariothemaio> lul
[2:17:13] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1412666647689764864?s=19

[2:17:18] <%CappuccinoGuil> Lilienne's signature????
[2:17:18] <BlackermanZX> LUL
[2:17:18] <LlewynMarie> not even his real name
[2:17:20] <%Gruhunchously> What?
[2:17:21] <Dopamien> Nice signature
[2:17:22] <JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[2:17:25] <Ecall10528> LUL
[2:17:25] <heemwizard> still works
[2:17:26] <heemwizard> relax
[2:17:29] <Blank9> DON'T call abigail
[2:17:29] <primaryfire> lmao
[2:17:30] <dukenux> that'll do
[2:17:31] <%SomeAsianDood> close enough
[2:17:35] <+illusiveSaint> woolie didn't even ask the people what they thought LUL
[2:17:35] <Ids560> ah yes that line lillienne drew
[2:17:38] <%Gruhunchously> Can I get your Idiot Doom Spiral
[2:17:38] <linSP> Mr doom spiral
[2:17:42] <%hax_metatron> NOOO
[2:17:43] <JetpackMcQuack> maybe
[2:17:45] <Picia000123> no she didn't
[2:17:46] <%mariothemaio> no?
[2:17:47] <Zomner> NO
[2:17:48] <Chatterbox1991> no
[2:17:48] <iacus_> oh that might be a glitch
[2:17:52] <%hax_metatron> Next to her column
[2:17:52] <%CappuccinoGuil> @WoolieVersus I think it's "Lilienne's space signature"
[2:17:52] <karawra> oop
[2:17:53] <%chandlerofearth> i think counted your forging attempt
[2:17:53] <%derap41> Skipped ti
[2:17:53] <skyenoz> Yes your honor, this line is her signature
[2:17:54] <Blank9> your forgery
[2:17:55] <+Jeshk0> bug?
[2:17:55] <+Bitscreed> Maybe it's Lilienne's printed name?
[2:17:55] <Dopamien> 🤷
[2:17:57] <TheD3rp416> the spot of Lilienne's signature is probably what it means
[2:17:59] <BerryliciousDefinition> Weird
[2:17:59] <tattleworm> next to where she's supposed to sign it @WoolieVersus
[2:18:00] <Deasmeister> No where shes supposed to sign
[2:18:02] <hekethe> It's where Lilienne's signature should be
[2:18:02] <iacus_> ah ok, a bugin the dialogue tree
[2:18:04] <Zomner> it's the line for her signature should be
[2:18:04] <$Combat_Data> no bug.
[2:18:05] <%hax_metatron> Evrart said get it from Lilienne and the old woman Woolie
[2:18:05] <%SomeAsianDood> lilienes space
[2:18:05] <+illusiveSaint> he signed it where she's supposed to sign it
[2:18:06] <%mariothemaio> it's worded weirdly
[2:18:08] <Picia000123> yes
[2:18:08] <iacus_> this is all going to plan though
[2:18:08] <Chatterbox1991> @WoolieVersus it's where Lilliene's signature should be
[2:18:09] <+PA_Raiden333> "Lilienne's Signature: ______"
[2:18:09] <zanzibarian_hamster> He wrote IDIOT DOOM SPIRAL where Lileannes signature should be
[2:18:10] <%CappuccinoGuil> The option says "I need two signatures"
[2:18:11] <%MightyDuckShoes> mistranslation
[2:18:18] <die_hardman> @woolieversus overthinking it
[2:18:25] <heemwizard> oh he's hallucinating
[2:18:26] <iacus_> the idea is to get invalid signatures and bail before Evrart catches on
[2:18:26] <Eger007> where it supposed to be
[2:18:27] <OblivionSword1> yeah could've worded that better
[2:18:27] <+Jeshk0> the wording is sometimes not very clear
[2:18:32] <servicesuspension> Tequila Sunset and Idiot Doom Spiral, what an ensemble
[2:18:33] <%krispen_wa> he signs for lilienne, and abs will sign for the old lady's space
[2:18:33] <+mechslayer71> keep in mind woolie never even asked what those people thought about all this. but woolie knows what's best for these silly stupid poor people :)
[2:18:37] <+mechslayer71> jk
[2:18:42] <%CappuccinoGuil> Harry just said "I need TWO signatures" so it mgiht be oddly worded
[2:18:42] <Ids560> I hope they mean the botched forgery
[2:18:46] <Dopamien> its worded poorly
[2:18:51] <$Combat_Data> It's assuming you are more familiar with legal forms
[2:18:52] <Project205> wait, wouldn't Evrat's agents see this?
[2:18:57] <skyenoz> this will DEFINITELY not stand in court

[2:22:09] <%hax_metatron> The problem here is that Woolie believes Evrart is totally evil
[2:22:09] <%Vigonept> You couldn't do it woolie you pay a pen for it
[2:22:10] <%chandlerofearth> you can get one real signature and forge the other
[2:22:14] <+Fedhas> load with the punches
[2:22:15] <Dopamien> CONTINUE THINKING
[2:22:16] <Picia000123> it's just a fucking pen
[2:22:17] <%Gruhunchously> Choose the pen or the village or fuck off
[2:22:17] <%kyh9> It's fine, just keep playing
[2:22:19] <+Mr_Pylon> and one route ends with PEN LOST
[2:22:20] <iacus_> that's the other way of doing it. it costs a pen
[2:22:20] <shincadad> Oh no, not the binoclard’s pen, end of the world
[2:22:20] <Picia000123> LUL

[2:22:38] <%Dakuu75> I can see Woolie's Stand being "Overthink" the same way Pat's is "Crazy Talk"
[2:22:39] <dukenux> plus, it's a really good pen
[2:22:40] <heemwizard> @shincadad DO NOT call kim a binoclard
[2:22:40] <%derap41> What will make Kim more sad the pen or the Villageg
[2:22:42] <kingra> Sad Kim :(
[2:22:42] <iacus_> You can get a different pen, maybe?
[2:22:44] <dukenux> it's like a Parker
[2:22:45] <+Afrobrawler> I think kim will understand the lost woolie
[2:22:50] <skyenoz> I think he'll understand
[2:22:51] <tattleworm> if kim's there, maybe he'd intervene?
[2:22:53] <doster504> Kim gave you the pen I'm sure he expects it to be slimy and not want it
[2:22:53] <Ids560> if you want him to not be sad, buy his rims back Kappa
[2:22:53] <WakeUpThrow> I don't think Kim will give a shit about the pen

[2:22:55] <wibbwobbler> Truuuee
[2:22:57] <BerryliciousDefinition> DO IT FOR KIM

[2:23:54] <%krispen_wa> This is mega dumb
[2:23:55] <%bread_assassin> What do we do about the signature now, though?
[2:23:57] <Dopamien> woolie isn't overthinking anything. what is this shitty meme?
[2:24:01] <BlackermanZX> thats a sick ass pen tho
[2:24:02] <Explodincatz> Woolie meta gaming the story

[2:56:00] <%CappuccinoGuil> @teefpal I meant phase, but face is even better LUL
[2:56:05] <%Gruhunchously> Everyone: Does SPOILER die on day 4 or is it later?
[2:56:05] <%cobalt_phoenix_> no wait for kim
[2:56:06] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> it didn't say look under the board walk lol it said look under the floor boar
[2:56:06] <%CappuccinoGuil> Also, Andre
[2:56:07] <%hax_metatron> There's more left below this part FYI
[2:56:07] <servicesuspension> did they do something with the FELD bldg?
[2:56:12] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Better to wait for kim
[2:56:14] <%meniscate> Well...
[2:56:17] <primaryfire> wait for kim to talk to the friend
[2:56:18] <%derap41> Kim sould be there
[2:56:19] <heemwizard> @servicesuspension noo
[2:56:19] <%doomerskeletor13> Kim should be there
[2:56:19] <TheD3rp416> Kim has a few unique interactions with them
[2:56:26] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> 100% wait for kim to talk to the two of them
[2:56:32] <Ids560> Kim does add something to the zoologist
[2:56:33] <mr_sups> Wait for Kim to talk with the Cryptos
[2:56:36] <%bread_assassin> Kim really oughta be there for the cryptozoologists.
[2:56:36] <%doomerskeletor13> Kim should be there for *content*
[2:56:40] <+Catbrainz> Ihave no idea what is happening but I'm enjoying greatly
[2:56:41] <die_hardman> @woolieversus it is recommended for Kim to be there. But your call
[2:56:45] <heemwizard> the sword is just extra
[2:56:46] <%krispen_wa> how many things do you NOT need kim for?
[2:56:49] <heemwizard> its dull too
[2:56:50] <+mechslayer71> do NOT talk to the crypto guys without kim
[2:57:02] <heemwizard> leave kim out of this guys
[2:57:11] <%teefpal> @mechslayer71 "ShibeCoin? Dont mind it I do!"
[2:57:13] <%Gruhunchously> You should have Kim around as much as possible for *maximum content*
[2:57:17] <servicesuspension> this place makes me sad :c
[2:57:18] <d41caesar> The bottom left stuff is doable without Kim though.
[2:57:22] <heemwizard> he doesnt need anymore racism directed at him
[2:57:22] <%X2Eliah> those are not the onews
[2:57:31] <%CappuccinoGuil> The only guaranteed thing without Kim right now is Andre
[2:57:32] <dukenux> can you use bolt cutters
[2:57:41] <%Vigonept> she said west of the board walk in the reeds
[2:57:48] <servicesuspension> oh that's an old ref
[2:57:54] <dukenux> reminds me of Blood Money's training level

[3:39:34] <kingra> monkaS
[3:39:38] <+illusiveSaint> the thought of Dolores dei is painful
[3:39:38] <Picia000123> Woolie, why do you segregate your skills into good and bad, they are all useful and also can fuck it up

[3:40:44] <%krispen_wa> Dolores is painful because it reminds you of how shit Westworld fucked up her character in S2 and S3
[3:40:51] <+illusiveSaint> your pain is irrelevant focus on the quiz
[3:40:55] <OblivionSword1> just try every answers
[3:41:06] <luftraumm1> problem is I don't think Dolores is a familiar name for non Latin language speakers, but the nickname is very common
[3:41:25] <servicesuspension> ultraliberal pope
[3:41:35] <+airchrysalis> dolores also means pain

[3:44:24] <+illusiveSaint> like a messiah
[3:44:25] <dukenux> God Emperor?
[3:44:32] <linSP> SUPER pope
[3:44:35] <Chatterbox1991> "Hierophant" is normally the word

[3:44:47] <%Gruhunchously> Dolores is Pain
[3:44:50] <kingra> Dolores...
[3:44:56] <JetpackMcQuack> a force of nature
[3:44:59] <Parasocial_Interaction> It's a Pope but they push forward social change...but usually by being kinda Ultra-liberal
[3:45:00] <dukenux> Not anymore
[3:45:03] <user_naim> The religion of Muad’dib is not Muad’dib. He spurns it and he spurns you
[3:45:04] <jigglepants> There were the Franconigerian cavalry
[3:45:08] <%vaderxyz1970> Super Ultra mega pope
[3:45:08] <+Jeshk0> this is definitely encyclopedia's funniest conversation
[3:45:12] <%X2Eliah> Pope but with actual magic
[3:45:13] <jigglepants> they were strong
[3:45:14] <servicesuspension> they all move history along
[3:45:14] <OblivionSword1> Dolores
[3:45:26] <luftraumm1> @user_naim exactly
[3:45:26] <+illusiveSaint> pope gives update patches to religion
[3:45:26] <%cobalt_phoenix_> of course
[3:45:27] <%SomeAsianDood> I hate this book so much. mainly because encyclopedia was me during hs and college
[3:45:28] <homelessproperty> A religion based on a great-man understanding of history
[3:45:37] <%SomeAsianDood> like looking at a black mirror
[3:45:40] <LeotheHuntsman> literally false wollie
[3:45:42] <%krispen_wa> I'm still encyclopedia because i have nothing else
[3:45:42] <%vaderxyz1970> Start a new save
[3:45:49] <%meniscate> The Pope didn't say trans rights...
[3:45:50] <Zomner> @user_naim based and goldenpilled
[3:45:50] <servicesuspension> yeah, gnosticism, sort of
[3:45:52] <linSP> what about my old save
[3:46:00] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @linSP make a new one
[3:46:01] <Victory_Boss> Greek and roman religions
[3:46:03] <%MightyDuckShoes> I don't think the Innocenses have actual powers. It's just this place's version of holy figures. Unless you believe all those Pipes were actually wielding the power of God... then... you do you
[3:46:06] <user_naim> Reading Dune has made me insufferable, because I can reference it everywhere
[3:46:11] <servicesuspension> That's why they have a Franconigerian Amry
[3:46:15] <servicesuspension> Army*
[3:46:18] <homelessproperty> This guy is basically Napoleon
[3:46:24] <%MightyDuckShoes> Popes**
[3:46:26] <dewwy125> the innocences = the enlightnement
[3:46:38] <%X2Eliah> @MightyDuckShoes but Dolores Dei was an actual alien
[3:46:51] <homelessproperty> 1
[3:46:51] <+Jeshk0> but this place is definitely more mystical than the real world, so i think its fair to interpret it as innocences actually having supernatural powers
[3:46:53] <Chatterbox1991> wait Woolie knows who Huey Long is?
[3:46:54] <%mariothemaio> i love encyclopedia in this
[3:46:59] <OblivionSword1> do 1 first

[3:47:14] <dukenux> okay so i guess Innocence is like a state level mediator

[3:47:27] <%cobalt_phoenix_> as useless as it is, it's still cool info
[3:47:28] <%X2Eliah> @dukenux much bigger
[3:47:31] <+airchrysalis> the innocence is the avatar
[3:47:32] <kingra> Encyclopedia...
[3:47:35] <JetpackMcQuack> holy = win
[3:47:36] <%derap41> If you meet the buddha Kill him
[3:47:39] <%mariothemaio> we're the MORALintern
[3:47:43] <jigglepants> Innocences are literally manifestations of the great man theory
[3:47:44] <%meniscate> The Dalai Pope King God Emperor President
[3:47:44] <%krispen_wa> The "Holy" "Roman" "Empire"
[3:47:48] <%X2Eliah> HOLY FUCK THE WORLD
[3:47:50] <skyenoz> so basically the Dalai Lama
[3:47:52] <Deasmeister> Dali lama style?
[3:47:57] <%cobalt_phoenix_> HOLY
[3:47:58] <%MightyDuckShoes> @x2eliah I missed that detail then. I can't say but... characters in the Bible are "aliens" too. It's a question wether any of this in-world legend is actually true.
[3:48:05] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @woolieversus like the MORALintern?
[3:48:06] <servicesuspension> oppress jesus, then oppress in the name of jesus
[3:48:08] <notadeasterisk> so it's the Dalai-lama
[3:48:10] <heemwizard> the SOYJAK???
[3:48:11] <iacus_> sounds cool and is cool tho

[3:54:03] <servicesuspension> jesus but also the pope but also napoleon
[3:54:05] <JetpackMcQuack> if its 200 bc and you aren't a murderer,
[3:54:07] <%CappuccinoGuil> @SomeAsianDood But everything Encyclo says here is just wrong or it misreads something, like telling you about pop quizzes instead of telling you about innocences. Not sure the monarcho part really explains that?
[3:54:12] <jorniev> huh?
[3:54:17] <Prevot> those war crimes were girlboss energy
[3:54:17] <notadeasterisk> ??
[3:54:21] <luftraumm1> and also queen Victoria
[3:54:23] <jorniev> what are you going on about now?
[3:54:25] <Chatterbox1991> Combination Jesus/Oliver Cromwell
[3:54:28] <zanzibarian_hamster> There were no video games, you had to do SOMETHING
[3:54:28] <dukenux> ???

[3:55:01] <JetpackMcQuack> culture wars ain't so bad
[3:55:04] <%doomerskeletor13> DAMN
[3:55:05] <iacus_> I guess the idea is that Encyclopedia is about hard facts and has toruble with interpretations like "the most important"?
[3:55:08] <%SomeAsianDood> @cappuccinoguil oh that? just remember that encyclo never actually gives u info the entire game only context

[4:18:35] <%livlinn> forgottenLiger forgottenLiger forgottenLiger
[4:18:40] <%purps26> next one is going to be a BANGER tho
[4:18:53] <%CappuccinoGuil> WE TAKE OVER THE BUS
[4:18:57] <Blank9> some day, karaoke
[4:18:57] <Dopamien> No 😡
[4:19:00] <iacus_> Next one is promising yeah
[4:19:03] <%Gruhunchously> SO MUCH CONTENT.
[4:19:03] <%CappuccinoGuil> ANARCHY REIGNS
[4:19:06] <%cobalt_phoenix_> BEEP BEEP
[4:19:08] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> this was a set up session for next session
[4:19:08] <+mechslayer71> @purps26 he'll find a way to not see the cool things, just wait
[4:19:10] <Virokwet> good stream
[4:19:12] <+kullumanati> Woolie bus
[4:19:14] <KaiserMario> Incorrect
[4:19:25] <%purps26> @mechslayer71 nah he's fine
[4:19:37] <Blank9> eh, more points in something doesn't mean more talks if you're already passing all the checks
[4:19:39] <@Solidus_113> remember even numbers for how much they interact
[4:19:41] <+Jeshk0> halfish
[4:19:42] <+mechslayer71> I just mean next session, he can't dodge forever
[4:19:59] <%purps26> just play how you want to play. cool stuff will happen regardless
[4:20:10] <tattleworm> there's an amazing bit with shivers that actually requires pretty dang good reaction speed, so it's hard to predict
[4:20:16] <%kyh9> It's delivering what you're aware of. You're never told about the Shiver Passives you fail
[4:20:25] <Deasmeister> I find a flat one is actually the most interesting as everything chimes in sometimes
[4:20:30] <%kyh9> I'd say 8 is a good level for most stats to get most of their dialogue
[4:20:33] <%CappuccinoGuil> This session just goes to show how much cool content there is with Kim. Fuck, I can't imagine playing this and making him leave
[4:20:50] <%kyh9> 8 is actually the sweetspot imo but it's up to you
[4:20:53] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @cappuccinoguil but cuno!
[4:20:59] <Blank9> going without kim's it's own thing too though
[4:21:03] <iambqb> 4 points in anything gives you the majority of their passives
[4:21:05] <%purps26> you gotta embrace the fact that you are gonna miss stuff. its unavoidable. just put points into skills you like
[4:21:05] <Blank9> especially if you're sad
[4:21:08] <%CappuccinoGuil> @abelincoln_catpuncher I mean going full racist and getting him to leave, tho
[4:21:08] <%kyh9> I popped my Reaction Speed up to 15 so maybe I'm crazy
[4:21:15] <%Gruhunchously> It's a bit of a gamble, yeah
[4:21:16] <Chatterbox1991> 12 i believe is the max you can go for all the checks
[4:21:22] <arkv01> ???
[4:21:25] <jigglepants> It's a shame your sensitive skills are so low. Play a SEN build my first try and it was great
[4:21:26] <%kyh9> haaaaaa
[4:21:26] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @cappuccinoguil yeah pissing off Kim is the big cry
[4:21:32] <jigglepants> played*
[4:21:32] <%kyh9> Think you're funny?
[4:21:33] <arkv01> did you get stds?
[4:21:34] <%CappuccinoGuil> ayyyyy
