[0:01:19] <%kyh9> Hey Woolie, can I Super Follow you on twitter?
[0:01:22] <%Lion_kun> Why is Canada such a shitty place to live?
[0:01:28] <pennykettle_> @Deekman I doubt it. I think Woolie prefers reading the summaries after a show
[0:01:32] <@akuda_bar> what is super following even
[0:01:41] <Necnill> It's alright man, don't sweat it
[0:01:42] <%krispen_wa> BEEP

[0:02:30] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Yeah not to minimize the effort, but no one cares if there are some beeps
[0:02:33] <%X2Eliah> Reggie could be finishing the game today
[0:02:37] <@Solidus_113> nah
[0:02:38] <heartlesshealer> Might wanna include disclaimer on youtube episodes though, since commenters are assholes
[0:02:42] <Darren716> Hey anyone else getting a purple screen about third party tools?

[0:03:05] <jackelzxaa> @WoolieVersus it might be worth doing at least one black world so reggie can see a primeval demon. (also, +5 adjudicator shield is super extra busted)

[0:04:49] <Visorak6> You are
[0:04:58] <%A_German_spy> YEAH spyYum
[0:05:01] <heartlesshealer> when things happen organically to reggie as devs intended because he's too pure
[0:05:04] <OldManDeckardCain> an lp'er finally gets why lps are fun Kappa

[0:05:08] <%gatorafan> üëÄ
[0:05:11] <pennykettle_> Playing a souls game with an audience is like if a newborn baby were fully aware of how incapable it is
[0:05:20] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus You only get one first playthrough. A vicarious one is the next best thing.
[0:05:24] <%X2Eliah> @heartlesshealer Well except when he zags instead of zigging
[0:05:25] <%ekodrop> reggie isn't jaded yet so it's great
[0:05:25] <Pookiedaexzile> Then We Modded it

[0:05:49] <%X2Eliah> @heartlesshealer and yesterday xD
[0:05:49] <+Grayhammatter> yooooooo
[0:05:57] <pennykettle_> Don't forget datamining Dark Souls 1 for the assets that might have originally belonged to the Demon's cut content
[0:06:00] <%X2Eliah> er I mena tuesday
[0:06:00] <heartlesshealer> @X2Eliah yes =)
[0:06:12] <andre11dr> And while your doing that you should watch that Vati art thing with it
[0:06:13] <seniormeatbox> @pennykettle_ ye
[0:06:24] <%A_German_spy> This is what Woolie's referring to: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JA9c01YsEFM
[0:06:29] <%Lion_kun> WHY DIDN'T BLUEPOINT FIX IT
[0:06:32] <Fibroidworm39> Hi everyone, first time watching woolie live WOOOOOO

[0:06:38] <%bread_assassin> bread_assassin subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months, currently on a 14 month streak! Fun Fact of the Month: In medieval times animals used to be subjected to trials for crimes just as humans were. The accused animal was given legal representation and usually sentenced to death if found guilty.
[0:06:39] <Davimotion96> So, no snitching?
[0:06:46] <pennykettle_> Artesian's streams are cool too
[0:06:55] <%demonvolk> Cheer1000 hey wools seen u senes friday night fisticuffs loves ya man u should try and check out texas Akon convention 3rd biggist anime thing in the states
[0:07:16] <pennykettle_> Illusory Wall's youtube channel is a must-sub
[0:07:26] <peachy996> Bluepoint can't add on with cut content sadly bc it doesn't work that way, I would have loved to see the Cut Colossi in Shadow of The Colossus.
[0:07:47] <jackelzxaa> bluepoint should do dark souls 1
[0:07:52] <jackelzxaa> that game could use an actual polish
[0:07:52] <@Solidus_113> nah
[0:08:02] <@Solidus_113> Remaster is fine
[0:08:06] <pennykettle_> I am too afraid of anyone touching DS1
[0:08:13] <jackelzxaa> yes but imagine if it was glorious
[0:08:19] <jackelzxaa> imagine if izalith was a visual delight
[0:08:22] <pennykettle_> lore cascade collapses if they change even one animal placement LUL
[0:08:27] <heartlesshealer> oops controller
[0:08:29] <jackelzxaa> dark souls dreams
[0:08:37] <pennykettle_> enemy placement* LUL animal placement??
[0:08:49] <%X2Eliah> Man Canadian fire alarm beeps are wild
[0:09:00] <Radioactivetaco9> "what say you in your defesnse" *woof*
[0:09:14] <heartlesshealer> Vmmm
[0:09:19] <%X2Eliah> Switch to wired controllers?
[0:09:20] <andre11dr> @x2eliah Wait, they are different?
[0:09:30] <%X2Eliah> @andre11dr They sound just like PS5 menu bings
[0:09:36] <heartlesshealer> wired controllers have the combination issues of range and tangle
[0:09:37] <@Solidus_113> I can't really think of any old games that play perfectly that Bluepoint could remake the visuals for
[0:09:41] <causewaybob> Who thinks he may get to 1-4 today
[0:09:42] <%Seancicle> ExtraLife
[0:09:49] <seniormeatbox> I do
[0:09:57] <%X2Eliah> aha
[0:10:08] <CappuccinoGuil> THE "HERO"
[0:10:10] <%bread_assassin> Curious how Woolie is gonna handle 3-3
[0:10:12] <heartlesshealer> Reggarth appear
[0:10:12] <%X2Eliah> DO YOU FEEL LIKE A HERO YET?
[0:10:18] <causewaybob> Big hero
[0:10:22] <jackelzxaa> whens reggie gonna use those colorless demon souls
[0:10:29] <Basic_Birch_> Back with reggie the influencer
[0:10:37] <@Solidus_113> Garl S*mpland
[0:10:40] <%gatorafan> greatest hero in the woooorld! Reggarth!
[0:10:44] <+robosqueeb> I wish we could have gotten Giants DLC
[0:10:46] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> So Twitch is just running mid-stream ads now huh?
[0:10:52] <%X2Eliah> yup
[0:10:57] <%X2Eliah> unless youre subbed
[0:10:57] <seniormeatbox> yuuup
[0:10:58] <%patriotrenegade> Woolie gaslighting Reggie last session
[0:11:12] <+robosqueeb> It's there, just super barebones
[0:11:15] <pennykettle_> twitch is running mid-stream ads targetting Alabama to stop union formation
[0:11:27] <heartlesshealer> feel of time restraints
[0:11:34] <Necnill> @pennykettle_ yiiikes
[0:11:35] <jackelzxaa> land of the giants dlc with an actual good dragon god boss in it woulda been kino dreams
[0:11:36] <andre11dr> It was really good
[0:11:39] <pennykettle_> Vaati's broken archstone art competition was the best one
[0:11:40] <%A_German_spy> In case anyone missed it, this is what Woolie's talking about: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JA9c01YsEFM
[0:11:40] <ShortAssRibs> A whole new wooooooooooooorld
[0:11:42] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Cool. Can't wait for Reggie's boss kill to get interrupted by some Amazon commercial. -_-'
[0:11:51] <+robosqueeb> >theme of sadness starts playing
[0:11:55] <heartlesshealer> contest to mod/create content? Neat
[0:11:59] <pennykettle_> I loved the interpretations of the giants that subverted expectations
[0:12:04] <causewaybob> It‚Äôs been done in other games though to
[0:12:12] <@Solidus_113> The Original Kirby Lore
[0:12:12] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:12:25] <heartlesshealer> kirby ate the giants
[0:12:25] <+robosqueeb> Bro what if WE were the giants all along
[0:12:27] <jackelzxaa> @WoolieVersus since Reggie's near the end of the game, would it be worth him just dumping his colorless demon souls into that shield at this point?
[0:12:47] <derap41> Also this game has 4 starting areas with means its a lot slower
[0:12:56] <causewaybob> Ds2 is a monster of a game
[0:12:59] <Fibroidworm39> do you think they kept the unused asset's in this remake ?
[0:13:04] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Yeah, no need to read that on stream
[0:13:04] <andre11dr> He has multiple contests and they all have some entries that have, MIND BLOWING levels of work thrown into it
[0:13:20] <%RyTYoung> WutFace
[0:13:40] <%X2Eliah> STRONK WOOD
[0:13:44] <%A_German_spy> Definitely don't think about why karacoLOL
[0:13:49] <LordOfThePoultry> maths monkaS
[0:13:50] <heartlesshealer> =)
[0:14:01] <jackelzxaa> DS2 is basically 2 games worth of content as one game (it might have been good if they split them into two games, since the dlc is so different anyways)
[0:14:09] <%RyTYoung> Orite Tam ma laddie!
[0:14:09] <CappuccinoGuil> @A_German_spy So Wood for light weapon and Silver for pew pews?
[0:14:21] <%A_German_spy> @CappuccinoGuil Wood for damage, silver only for the extra MP.
[0:14:24] <causewaybob> Whip your wood out for bigger damage
[0:14:41] <CappuccinoGuil> @A_German_spy toss that silver into the garbage. TRASH
[0:14:47] <jackelzxaa> can you upgrade catalysts in des?
[0:14:50] <Radioactivetaco9> C > C ?
[0:14:53] <heartlesshealer> higher on the C spectrum
[0:15:02] <heartlesshealer> invisible stats!
[0:15:07] <dundore77> what about the other one you need a demon soul to create? or did he already use that soul?
[0:15:15] <causewaybob> C++
[0:15:20] <%A_German_spy> @CappuccinoGuil Silver has its uses. If you're on a limited-SL build and you need temporary extra MP to get over the 100 threshold for Second Chance, for example, you can swap it in. Wooden is always better for damage, though.
[0:15:20] <pmda2126> c.3
[0:15:21] <CappuccinoGuil> @Radioactivetaco9 scaling is on a spectrum. Think of them as being invisibly C-, C and C+
[0:15:24] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Arrr, some seas be better than other seas
[0:15:25] <pennykettle_> Scaling is basically a number that they categorize as letter grades. 99 on a test is better than a 95 but both A's
[0:15:27] <%krispen_wa> All Cs are created equal, but some are more equal than others
[0:15:29] <pmda2126> vs c.6
[0:15:45] <pennykettle_> Upper Latria sbfpRage
[0:15:47] <+MisleadingEchoes> This level of optimization makes the first run of a game so boring and sometimes the fanbase ruins things by pushing this.
[0:15:48] <causewaybob> Does you catalyst run Java lol
[0:15:51] <andre11dr> Now the best zone is in motion
[0:15:51] <CappuccinoGuil> @A_German_spy we're all about damage in my runs. I like seeing those big numbers.
[0:16:04] <%A_German_spy> @CappuccinoGuil I'll drink to that
[0:16:09] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[0:16:10] <heartlesshealer> catalyst ME or catalyst 98
[0:16:15] <pennykettle_> This is the most fantastical area in any of these games
[0:16:15] <%RyTYoung> Oh shit we still have 3-3 to deal with Kappa
[0:16:17] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Time for Memes
[0:16:18] <whiteblacklight74> HAVE CONFIDENCE
[0:16:18] <cobalt_phoenix_> have confidence
[0:16:22] <%krispen_wa> Can Reggie beat Demon souls today?
[0:16:23] <%baka_sugoi> T-POSE FOR CONFIDENCE
[0:16:25] <dundore77> i take it they fixed the cheap trick for the boss in this area regarding teh fog gate?
[0:16:35] <%ekodrop> i hope they haven't patched the glitched section here
[0:16:36] <%krispen_wa> @dundore77 yes
[0:16:36] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> Have confidence
[0:16:37] <Fibroidworm39> og demon's souls is only on ps3 right?

[0:17:35] <prime_name> Don't stop me now
[0:17:36] <redrins> hug those edges
[0:17:38] <pmda2126> it isn't that bad
[0:17:43] <andre11dr> My one problem with this place is that it kinda makes no sense when you think about how it most likely used to totally look like this before Old Monk took over
[0:18:11] <%krispen_wa> Building design is convuluted in Latria
[0:18:13] <%RyTYoung> oh hai
[0:18:16] <heartlesshealer> Congratulations!

[0:18:44] <+Graxe_> And that's before enchanting
[0:18:46] <peachy996> Mind your footing
[0:18:51] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Reggie is Saitama

[0:18:55] <%X2Eliah> reggie can finish DeS today
[0:18:59] <whiteblacklight74> just fyi
[0:19:01] <jackelzxaa> Is reggie gonna do real 3-3 or easy 3-3?
[0:19:02] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> enemy design at risk
[0:19:04] <+Graxe_> Who cares about slashing
[0:19:09] <+Graxe_> Reggie has a magic sword

[0:21:47] <heartlesshealer> Reggarth and the Pulsating Mass
[0:22:11] <%Prattlesworth> And Reggie could not lie to himself about it
[0:22:15] <ShortAssRibs> DTF
[0:22:20] <jackelzxaa> remember when reggie used to skip messages?
[0:22:22] <brunoberserk> some of the enemies in this area have a mike mignola's vibe
[0:22:23] <%DegenCat> Reggie's DTF (Down To Fight)
[0:22:32] <MadBaller123> Has he met with Yogurt the silent chief yet?
[0:22:41] <%Prattlesworth> There was beautyin it‚Äôs grossness
[0:22:52] <CappuccinoGuil> We're always down to DTFF
[0:22:54] <%krispen_wa> I just managed to get DeS running on an emulator after years thanks to the new Vulcan rendering system. but everytime i roll into an object my framerate shits itself because apparently Havok physics are super heavy on the cpu
[0:22:58] <CappuccinoGuil> Down To Fuck Fight
[0:23:02] <ShortAssRibs> Down to drop a soul
[0:23:23] <ace_sabo_luffy__> Knowone will judge you for setting comands to stylish Kappa

[0:23:33] <peachy996> More Brooklyn
[0:23:36] <%ChoculaUltra> Lexington, Hudson, Goliath FeelsBadMan
[0:23:42] <%krispen_wa> That Gargoyle runs back SUPER fast
[0:23:43] <peachy996> Lexington is in Cainhurst
[0:23:47] <pmda2126> no pew pew magic?
[0:23:49] <defaultname3887> o man so reggie finally got to detroit
[0:23:52] <jackelzxaa> @woolie theres a weird glitch with 3-2 where you can use the boss fight to pump white world tendency before beating the zone, because it actually awards partial benefit for doing the thing, even if you die and restart the boss
[0:24:05] <derap41> OSHA had a field day hare
[0:24:11] <SixthShinx> RIP that item
[0:24:18] <eldragon_1> Bronx was best doggo
[0:24:25] <pennykettle_> It was probably just a lot of royals up here going to rich people meetings
[0:24:33] <+Undenizen> the star wars school of architecture
[0:24:37] <Raldavar> So Patches is Puck. Who is Xanatos the 9d chess god?
[0:24:37] <pmda2126> gargoyles was great
[0:24:38] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Maybe there used to be railings karacoLOL
[0:24:40] <%X2Eliah> Yeah these walkways are not OSHA approved
[0:24:45] <%baka_sugoi> DO IT
[0:24:48] <Sol_Install> doit

[0:24:55] <Darren716> LUL
[0:24:59] <ace_sabo_luffy__> Guardgoyles..... Sorry
[0:24:59] <%krispen_wa> LUL
[0:25:00] <prime_name> Slap the meat
[0:25:09] <Pookiedaexzile> Only Ye with little Faith would need side railing
[0:25:09] <%cache_22> That tickles
[0:25:14] <CappuccinoGuil> Beat that meat, Reggie
[0:25:16] <%krispen_wa> LUL LUL LUL
[0:25:16] <EvanAlmighty210> da big meat
[0:25:17] <derap41> Its made of meat
[0:25:18] <+gutlesscoward> it's meat! :D
[0:25:19] <jackelzxaa> if reggie attacks the mass too much he unlocks the true final boss
[0:25:25] <pmda2126> Reggarth in the freezer
[0:25:27] <lbrownthedestroyer> Bye Bye sword durablity
[0:25:29] <+cvp5127> niku
[0:25:31] <andre11dr> What a great MK caracter
[0:25:33] <BlackermanZX> beating the meat huh woolieMIRIN
[0:25:50] <jackelzxaa> imagine what bluepoint could do with anor londo
[0:25:52] <%Seancicle> osez?
[0:25:53] <pennykettle_> Why am I imagining the Doom Eternal mechas walking between these towers
[0:25:54] <jackelzxaa> and painted world
[0:25:55] <pmda2126> big meat
[0:25:55] <%krispen_wa> Latria and Shrine of Storms definitely were the winners of this remake
[0:25:58] <%LastHazzerd> yeow
[0:25:59] <%Lion_kun> The inspiration for Bloodborne
[0:26:15] <Ashenik1> guys guys since Reggie wants to play more souls-borne games maybe he sould finally finish this Sekiro series Kappa
[0:26:25] <%ekodrop> there was an out of world glitch in 3-2 where if you roll at the right angle under the second or third elevator you could go to a lower section of the map. idk if it's been patched
[0:26:34] <pennykettle_> @Ashenik1 sbfpRichard
[0:26:34] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:26:36] <jackelzxaa> fat official and adjudicator are the only bits that i'm kind of meh on still
[0:26:37] <%krispen_wa> I'm tired too bro
[0:26:38] <causewaybob> This is Bloodborne af
[0:26:44] <jackelzxaa> vanguard too but adjudicator was a bit much
[0:26:46] <%X2Eliah> oh that suuuucks
[0:26:50] <%RyTYoung> I know what you mean
[0:26:50] <Sol_Install> yea
[0:26:58] <+Undenizen> The Vatican has a really crazy flat spiral staircase designed for horses.
[0:26:58] <jackelzxaa> "every fatty MUST be grossoid"
[0:27:00] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> hate those
[0:27:01] <Sol_Install> i know what woolie talking about
[0:27:04] <pennykettle_> I went to DC once and the escalator was steep and long as fuck and I was terrified I was going to fall down
[0:27:14] <defaultname3887> any non regular staircase tires me at twice the pase, it's horrible
[0:27:20] <causewaybob> Grandma for to take her thyroid medication lol
[0:27:20] <%X2Eliah> Also easier to roll your ankle going down
[0:27:23] <%Deekman> so strong
[0:27:25] <$BallerSwagBro9k> jesus
[0:27:27] <SixthShinx> These sword gargoyles are chumps
[0:27:27] <Darren716> We had some bullshit stairs at my college that were like half the size they should be and were all falling apart
[0:27:31] <+Grayhammatter> jesus
[0:27:32] <SharktheNerd> good damage
[0:27:34] <$BallerSwagBro9k> HE RUNNIN
[0:27:37] <lbrownthedestroyer> SWORD TOO STRONG
[0:27:39] <Darren716> How no one died on them I'll never know
[0:27:39] <%cache_22> I'm not going to lie but I had a hard time with this area my first time. Reggie is making it look easy at this point.
[0:27:42] <%krispen_wa> I like double size stairs with half the steps. i already naturally step two stairs at a time
[0:27:49] <prime_name> That gargoyle moves like a mario kart AI
[0:27:53] <+Grayhammatter> that is a LOTTA damage
[0:28:00] <Rafraud> Oh shit we're doing best zone?
[0:28:03] <$BallerSwagBro9k> That dude wanted NO PART of that lmao
[0:28:05] <glass_marcus> flamberger
[0:28:05] <%krispen_wa> @cache_22 i mean he is doing this as his last area with a fully upgraded weapon. its natural for it to be easy
[0:28:07] <%Seancicle> contexte manquant
[0:28:09] <%X2Eliah> Flambergee Egg
[0:28:16] <%Noonoox12> Remember, this is his FINAL non-1 zone at only tier 2. Of COURSE he's steamrollin
[0:28:20] <%Lion_kun> This is just pathetic. Like why bother put enemies? lol
[0:28:23] <EvanAlmighty210> can woolie speak french?
[0:28:33] <causewaybob> It‚Äôs pretty cool is it a great sword in this one
[0:28:41] <testis1> woolie speaks flawless french
[0:28:47] <+Undenizen> unlike most swords, which are non-fatal
[0:28:51] <peachy996> If there's one things to say about FromSoft, it's that they LOVE if you have a fear of heights
[0:28:51] <testis1> gaskwah
[0:28:57] <andre11dr> No that was the Kriss
[0:29:02] <%baka_sugoi> FANCIE
[0:29:03] <%Lion_kun> Pat call out.
[0:29:14] <EvanAlmighty210> @testis1 oh yeah, I remember that lol
[0:29:22] <causewaybob> Plague info lol
[0:29:34] <+Grayhammatter> things and stuff
[0:29:35] <%Noonoox12> @EvanAlmighty210 they're in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. French is the primary language
[0:29:38] <%X2Eliah> curved. sword.
[0:29:51] <Sol_Install> it's a two handed weapon
[0:29:57] <+Undenizen> it IS a sword with curves in it.
[0:29:59] <pmda2126> long and hefty
[0:30:07] <%DegenCat> Nah, actually curved blades are better at slicing than straight blades, so the multiple curves gives it better slicing capability without sacrificing the capacity for stabbing with the tip, which curves swords are usually worse at.
[0:30:09] <MyNameIsRasus> Good luck Reggie!
[0:30:10] <causewaybob> Big boy sward
[0:30:14] <pennykettle_> Is there documentation on the relative locations of the DeS worlds? I still have not much clue of they're all even parts of Boletaria or separate kingdoms
[0:30:16] <%X2Eliah> What was it, ricasso?
[0:30:20] <Raldavar> Serrated weapons got balanced with the introduction of full body armor
[0:30:21] <andre11dr> It bleeds, but it's not worth, you might as well use a fast weapon to get bleed
[0:30:26] <pi_in_the_sci> it's a claymore with the stats of a dex weapon
[0:30:30] <EvanAlmighty210> @Noonoox12 ah, that makes sense. I forgot he lives in Montr√©al
[0:30:39] <%X2Eliah> LUL
[0:30:42] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[0:30:42] <Darren716> Reggie doesnt notice LUL
[0:30:45] <SixthShinx> Gargoyle sandwich
[0:30:48] <andre11dr> And Claymore is like the same moveset but most damage
[0:30:52] <testis1> a curved sword slices better, but sacrifices being double edged.
[0:30:56] <+Undenizen> @pennykettle_ i believe the canon is they're kinda isolated chunks of reality, so it's impossible to know the original distance between them
[0:30:57] <%X2Eliah> Reggie speedrunning
[0:31:01] <%dreadedcthulhu> wrong sword lol
[0:31:04] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[0:31:06] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Like cutting thru butter
[0:31:06] <pmda2126> are they not fighting back?
[0:31:09] <brunoberserk> wrong sword
[0:31:09] <+Grayhammatter> wrong sword too
[0:31:12] <%ekodrop> time to edge
[0:31:15] <testis1> a katana is not curved by design but bends in the coolinh process
[0:31:20] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> wrong grass
[0:31:26] <whiteblacklight74> welcome to the hole
[0:31:28] <%X2Eliah> LUL
[0:31:31] <causewaybob> Ohh there she comes
[0:31:34] <whiteblacklight74> HEY LOOK AT THAT THING
[0:31:36] <Pookiedaexzile> WRONG SWORD
[0:31:38] <%KiwamiKiryu> can't wait
[0:31:43] <%Noonoox12> @pennykettle_ they're totally separate kingdoms, I believe. Hence why boletaria isn't mentioned outside of zone 1, where it IS mentioned extensively
[0:31:43] <andre11dr> I mean they arw are both pretty op weapons
[0:31:51] <%cache_22> Jebaited
[0:31:51] <%KiwamiKiryu> Legit this made me drop the game for a while
[0:32:00] <causewaybob> Watch out boy she‚Äôll chew you
[0:32:06] <Raldavar> Flamberg is absolutely better than the claymore/bastard sword in DS3. Not so much in DeS
[0:32:10] <whiteblacklight74> Is this Anor Londo?
[0:32:15] <OldManDeckardCain> yes
[0:32:19] <+Grayhammatter> EZ
[0:32:22] <%X2Eliah> This IS Anor Londo
[0:32:24] <%baka_sugoi> ITS LIT

[0:32:30] <%Lightwolfe> one unit of loot
[0:32:30] <testis1> this is a wendys
[0:32:31] <pennykettle_> @Noonoox12 I don't know why I got the idea that Boletaria is both the whole encompassing kingdom and also the capitol
[0:32:33] <%RyTYoung> @whiteblacklight74 Imagine Anor London's gothic sister
[0:32:41] <+Grayhammatter> a loot, this is a wendy's
[0:32:45] <%RyTYoung> Londor* ffs auto correct
[0:32:48] <andre11dr> So it's the Grand Cathedral
[0:32:50] <ToneBacas> useful message

[0:40:09] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[0:40:09] <%krispen_wa> wait does stuff happen every time he visits nexus or every time he kills a boss?

[0:40:11] <pmda2126> are you?
[0:40:14] <whiteblacklight74> ok sure
[0:40:20] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus You're more right than you know, Reggie
[0:40:22] <%Parapattern> @andre11dr Maybe those babies just had bad vibes
[0:40:22] <%dreadedcthulhu> whatever you have to tell yourself to sleep at night reggie

[0:40:52] <%dreadedcthulhu> @rytyoung not as busy as u would think
[0:40:55] <MyNameIsRasus> it's fucking weird
[0:41:02] <%krispen_wa> considering he only has 3 left, nothing bad can really happen then
[0:41:05] <Ashenik1> so this is a bloodbore area
[0:41:25] <whiteblacklight74> poop gang poop gang poop gang
[0:41:27] <pennykettle_> When we didn't know much about what Bloodborne would be, they told us it would be Latria the game
[0:41:27] <@Solidus_113> I can't believe Demon's Souls stole from Bloodborne
[0:41:32] <derap41> man this ring is in the wrong swamp
[0:41:41] <andre11dr> @ashenik1 All of Latria is proto Bloodborne
[0:41:41] <%ozzrabbit> @equirah I‚Äôm not worried about the now, I‚Äôm worried about the ‚Äúthing to come‚Äù next time Reggie goes to the Nexus.
[0:41:55] <%cache_22> Trickledown demonomics
[0:42:01] <%X2Eliah> So, on top are the towers, on bottom is this shit swamp, so where di the prison go?
[0:42:07] <pennykettle_> I am in love with Bloodborne but this place seems so much more bleak and disturbed and dark
[0:42:13] <Equirah> @ozzrabbit i understand, he doesn't have enough game left for anything serious to happen
[0:42:21] <whiteblacklight74> poop
[0:42:24] <+FuqBoiSlim> Bloodborne this Bloodborne that. well I was born a Blood. think about that kiddos
[0:42:27] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @krispen_wa who does he have left? I know he‚Äôs got two from here which is the last one?
[0:42:34] <+s0ki_> Latria needs a fire bombing
[0:42:37] <derap41> Mutated baby faced demons its all good
[0:42:40] <Rafraud> Oh he missed the shortcut didn't he

[0:43:16] <whiteblacklight74> the real sleaze
[0:43:17] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> so we having high standards now?
[0:43:17] <%Seancicle> je pas. tu nes pas
[0:43:18] <Ashenik1> @andre11dr I am pretty sure if Elden Ring comes out there will be an area in one of their games that we can call proto-ER
[0:43:21] <BlackermanZX> EA levels of filth
[0:43:23] <whiteblacklight74> she needed more NTR
[0:43:24] <%ozzrabbit> @equirah it happens per boss. There are two bosses in 5, and the big bad in 1. That‚Äôs enough for 1 named NPC
[0:43:24] <%baka_sugoi> ew STINKY
[0:43:28] <%krispen_wa> The highest of low standards
[0:43:30] <LordOfThePoultry> this is minimum filth compared to the swamp
[0:43:33] <%patriotrenegade> too much blood, not enough dirt
[0:43:34] <pmda2126> she liked her üçñ rank
[0:43:45] <whiteblacklight74> needs more poop
[0:43:48] <%X2Eliah> Elden Ring will 100% have a shit swamp area
[0:43:51] <peachy996> Filthy Lady: "I need brown brown brown in my life"
[0:43:58] <%krispen_wa> @ozzrabbit and that named NPC literally does nothing so its fine
[0:44:05] <whiteblacklight74> she went to absorb the fart gas
[0:44:10] <Murdercles> people thinking Elden Ring is real LUL
[0:44:11] <%SuckerPunchSyd> This place and all of zone 5 made me just feel so gross
[0:44:19] <MyNameIsRasus> If Elden Ring is open world like the rumors say it will be a big ass swamp area
[0:44:20] <whiteblacklight74> uoooooooooh my dysenteryyyyyyyyyyyy
[0:44:23] <andre11dr> Well, Elden Ring does have a strong DS2 vibe to its look, but more interesting
[0:44:35] <Equirah> @ozzrabbit @krispen_wa not to mention at that point a ng cycle starts
[0:44:36] <+Undenizen> @X2Eliah people hate on the swamp areas but i find they're always memorable and interesting.
[0:44:36] <pmda2126> filthy lady, peg enthusiasm
[0:44:41] <%Deekman> it's so hard to see. I had to turn on the Bright graphics filter here lol
[0:44:45] <%Josef_Stryker> Does Reggie just have Tower of Latria to beat and then the rest of Castle Bolataria?
[0:44:45] <%krispen_wa> Elden Ring is the 6th archstone
[0:44:46] <%SuckerPunchSyd> A look of permanent concern of filth
[0:44:47] <testis1> will sekiro have a sequel?
[0:44:47] <%Parapattern> The stealth

[0:45:06] <andre11dr> It's makes sense since DS2 was more Nordic based in its visual

[1:09:39] <%X2Eliah> Why not go there now?
[1:09:45] <%A_German_spy> @Deekman There's also Istarelle, the Moonlight Greatsword and the Northern Regalia
[1:09:49] <Equirah> i wish they'd gotten rid of gender restrictions in the remake
[1:10:11] <Pookiedaexzile> See REgarths dick is too big for that mask
[1:10:28] <CappuccinoGuil> @WoolieVersus you have one already, why not upgrade the shield with it?
[1:10:29] <Pookiedaexzile> Only explanation
[1:10:31] <%X2Eliah> AREA ALMOST DONE
[1:10:33] <+MisleadingEchoes> I don't think this DS is a Remake at all, it's more a Remaster since almost nothing really changed gameplay-wise.
[1:10:35] <%X2Eliah> SO STRONG
[1:10:39] <%krispen_wa> Only 3 colorless souls you can get naturally without messing with world tendency
[1:10:39] <%X2Eliah> SUCH HERO

[1:11:18] <BoxNavy> monkaS strange
[1:11:20] <Equirah> @MisleadingEchoes why'd you make a clown of yourself like this, remaster implies original assets while remake means making new assets

[1:46:28] <whiteblacklight74> high class meatings

[1:51:07] <%A_German_spy> @Lion_kun 4 slots, or 5 with the Ring of Magical Nature
[1:51:09] <lonosi55> woolie just wants reggie to beat this game already
[1:51:11] <wantedsafe471> What a Superb Demon!
[1:51:12] <Lion_kun> Like get attunement at the soft cap?
[1:51:21] <%Lion_kun> Thanks Spy
[1:51:25] <dundore77> Its pretty cool how strong reggies gotten without really any grinding, unless theres been offscreen stuff ive missed
[1:51:38] <whiteblacklight74> i wonder what it does
[1:51:39] <+Grayhammatter> uh... was someone dead?
[1:51:43] <+Jiggisnipe> his sword is pretty good
[1:51:44] <%Deekman> @WoolieVersus why don't we go see Ed so we have an excuse to come back here again
[1:51:45] <%dreadedcthulhu> tell me more? (scared)
[1:51:51] <Monkeyweed21> show him the talisman too
[1:51:52] <%A_German_spy> @Lion_kun No worries. Yeah, hard cap is 4 sorcery slots, then you can use the ring for a fifth
[1:52:25] <Rafraud> Just got back from interview, did he do fuck pit yet?
[1:52:37] <ronin19xx> You guys think this is the last session?
[1:52:39] <dundore77> he only has 5-4 left
[1:52:45] <ShortAssRibs> No :(
[1:52:47] <%X2Eliah> 1-4
[1:52:48] <%Lion_kun> 1-4
[1:52:50] <%A_German_spy> @ronin19xx For sure it is. He has one boss left.
[1:52:54] <%Noonoox12> WHO BE DEAD THO?
[1:52:54] <lonosi55> @ronin19xx hopefully
[1:52:56] <dundore77> 1-4*
[1:53:04] <kazataca> If you just lvl up from boss reward souls you can already play smoothly through DeS
[1:53:05] <Rafraud> Oh so he skipped pvp boss?
[1:53:11] <SolGoodguy> seeing the development of reggie on the souls series has been fun
[1:53:14] <wantedsafe471> Its Cursed Weapon
[1:53:15] <ronin19xx> @A_German_spy Well 2 technically
[1:53:15] <%Lion_kun> Didn't he get all the white events in 1?
[1:53:17] <+Grayhammatter> no, he fought spy
[1:53:19] <Equirah> @Rafraud just did it
[1:53:22] <Rafraud> MAN
[1:53:23] <%Lion_kun> He can stay human now.
[1:53:25] <Fabpsi_> well..german spy skipped the pvp boss for reggie^^'
[1:53:26] <Rafraud> Fair I guess
[1:53:29] <%A_German_spy> @ronin19xx Yeah, technically karacoLOL
[1:53:42] <Rafraud> I feel like we should at least let him experience full pvp tho lol
[1:53:48] <Rafraud> But also could break playthrough
[1:53:49] <andre11dr> @woolieversus So ,one detail Reggie probably missed, is that all those monsters including gargoyles and Man Eaters used to be the upper class of Latria that the Old Monk used as experiments
[1:53:49] <Rafraud> Fair game

[1:56:31] <SolGoodguy> brings a t ear to my eye
[1:56:32] <peachy996> He could do BB next since there's no sequels
[1:56:34] <gsoto83> Remember when Reggie had to punch them cause they were strong against his sword LUL

[1:57:27] <Darren716> Reggie gonna beat it today ain't he?
[1:57:29] <andre11dr> I do hope that if Reggie decides to play this again, he does it in human form, because playing it that way is..let's say humbling
[1:57:30] <ronin19xx> Yeah hes ending the game on a confident note
[1:57:36] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Reggie has come so far
[1:57:40] <ronin19xx> Unless...
[1:57:41] <+Sharmanyx> What wep is he using

[1:58:28] <+YungFBI> is that a sub count
[1:58:29] <penitentpendant> Overconfidence is BUILDING
[1:58:30] <gsoto83> From meger beginnings, raised a true hero of the ages
[1:58:32] <andre11dr> Part of me does kinda hope that Allant soul sucks him like 6 times LUL
[1:58:51] <+king_of_beggars> Look how strong our boy has become.
[1:58:54] <%A_German_spy> @andre11dr Oh, that fight's going to knock him down a peg. It's quite different from almost everything else in this game.
[1:59:01] <%X2Eliah> "hero of the ages" eh?
[1:59:14] <ronin19xx> The weapon works with Reggies thematic character look, Arabian like
[1:59:25] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @a_german_spy that fight is lots of fun. Might be one of my favorites
[1:59:27] <+axenred> ds3 fixed this whole mess
[1:59:32] <syanplague> thank you Woolie and Reggie for the entreteriment
[1:59:34] <+axenred> ds2 too
[1:59:37] <%X2Eliah> Yeah this reload stuff is BS
[1:59:43] <Darren716> DS3 fucked me up, I exited and lost the item
[1:59:44] <%A_German_spy> @SuckerPunchSyd Mine too. It's definitely one of the fastest-paced.
[1:59:48] <wantedsafe471> didnt ds2 also fix that too?
[2:00:00] <ronin19xx> Oh man I just remembered the theme of the last boss, this will be epic
[2:00:00] <gsoto83> Heroes would save scum if they could too LUL
[2:00:03] <penitentpendant> Honestly, in many ways, that's a really rich bird
[2:00:19] <%SuckerPunchSyd> That bird has *drip*

[2:02:27] <%KeiganOfAstora> Reggie, what are you trying to do?
[2:02:35] <%X2Eliah> So it was bosses right? not visits?
[2:02:38] <%Noonoox12> what are the faith bois up to?

[2:03:00] <Rafraud> Lmao
[2:03:01] <+gutlesscoward> how's haircut's haircut?
[2:03:06] <SarcFa> faith boys die first, and things only happen after boss kills
[2:03:27] <SarcFa> so there's only been one boss kill where things happen in nexus
[2:03:30] <Basic_Birch_> doesn't the magick boyo die first?
[2:03:31] <Johannen> So Old Monk did not count for Yurt or wut?
[2:03:45] <+Kungfuski> woolie make reggie drink from old mcdonalds cups not real glasses
[2:03:49] <%jepupu> Does he even know where Yurt is?
[2:03:55] <%X2Eliah> He saw him
[2:03:55] <gsoto83> Big Pluses
[2:03:56] <peachy996> He does
[2:03:59] <%Deekman> @Johannen yeah he got 2 corpses already

[2:04:06] <%jepupu> Oh boy
[2:04:07] <%X2Eliah> and didn√§t realize
[2:04:08] <%krispen_wa> and the only real npc that can die right now i think is patches after he finishes 1-4, and by then it wont matter
[2:04:09] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Yurt hasn‚Äôt given his name to him at all either
[2:04:18] <gsoto83> LETS GO!!!!!
[2:04:19] <ronin19xx> This is nuts

[2:04:53] <andre11dr> Yea, it was made in 2009
[2:04:53] <whiteblacklight74> would've been great with cursed weapon
[2:04:56] <ronin19xx> Damage is null
[2:04:56] <%krispen_wa> Demon Souls is why I use a guide for EVERY souls game
[2:05:03] <%X2Eliah> Reggie is actually invincible now
[2:05:05] <lbrownthedestroyer> This game came with a massive pdf manual at OG release
[2:05:14] <therealtacopancakes> I loved the first years of demons and dark souls where the community all was like what the fuck and guides where being made
[2:05:14] <roarofdamnation> If you need a blacksmith show me your steel. Reggarth: shows him his wood
[2:05:14] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:05:15] <gsoto83> Its plus!
[2:05:19] <gsoto83> What more do you need!
[2:05:21] <%Deekman> folks would just buy the guide lol
[2:05:22] <Visorak6> Went from 2hp/s to 5
[2:05:23] <Pookiedaexzile> DArk Souls: Fuck you Stop playing. or not b-baka
[2:05:25] <whiteblacklight74> reggarth proposing to his blacksmith husbando
[2:05:27] <+Jiggisnipe> it's safe on block Kappa
[2:05:29] <Johannen> At this point i dont want Reggie to know about Yurt so he can expirience Lotrec CLEAN
[2:05:30] <NumbF4ke> At least one is dead, since reggie killed old monk after yurt was in nexus
[2:05:31] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Final boss?
[2:05:35] <ronin19xx> And we got a boss
[2:05:37] <sendart> catalyst?
[2:05:39] <Basic_Birch_> Isn't it impossible for even patches to die at this point?

[2:06:03] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[2:06:09] <DSD24> Wow I just checked my PS3 copy the Manual was really big
[2:06:15] <ShortAssRibs> honestly not worth it
[2:06:18] <%KeiganOfAstora> And in black and white
[2:06:18] <Johannen> @SuckerPunchSyd lautrec..language differences)
[2:06:24] <%KeiganOfAstora> Why were manuals always in B&W?
[2:06:27] <%krispen_wa> my hat goes out to those people who first play the Souls games blind and miss out on every single questline
[2:06:33] <andre11dr> Do we have enough to get Dorian?
[2:06:37] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @johannen ahh gotcha!
[2:06:38] <DSD24> Not all the manuals were in black and white

[2:06:43] <gsoto83> @Frazzyfraznor I would say depends on the person, but thats hard to read into sometimes. Woolie knows Reggie best so he knows how much detail to give him
[2:06:56] <DSD24> @lbrownthedestroyer Really? that souds rad!
[2:07:00] <DSD24> sounds
[2:07:03] <%KeiganOfAstora> @DSD24 Most were. It was rare to see one in color. It meant they really cared about the game. Super Smash Bros Melee was in color

[2:09:07] <%A_German_spy> @krispen_wa It occurs at slightly different rates from different sources, but it works out to about 24HP/second purely from gear, plus another 16 from the Regeneration miracle and I'm not sure how much from that new Grass Jelly consumable
[2:09:11] <whiteblacklight74> every time
[2:09:12] <%Deekman> i got PS5 drift. It suuucks
[2:09:16] <+Frazzyfraznor> Having woolie is way better than a guide. But not everyone is fortunate enough to have their own woolie

[2:09:34] <Darren716> Who even needs grass?
[2:09:40] <gsoto83> @Deekman any word on joystick replacements?
[2:09:44] <%jepupu> Holy weapons do the same amount of regen if I remember right

[2:14:45] <%krispen_wa> are we gonna have reggie do bl*ck tendency events after this?
[2:14:51] <lbrownthedestroyer> GUN TO YOUR HEAD: It's black history month and you have to choose a movie for it "Down to earth" or "White Chicks"
[2:14:51] <DSD24> Jpeg Cat ring
[2:14:54] <%KeiganOfAstora> You can say "black"
[2:14:57] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus You can get those without it.
[2:14:58] <brunoberserk> ''hey Minh , Reggie went FULL Booker T ,you know what to do ''
[2:15:05] <%KeiganOfAstora> White Chicks
[2:15:09] <DSD24> White Chicks is really funny so that one
[2:15:13] <%X2Eliah> So this is actually the Endgame
[2:15:18] <penitentpendant> Minh: "Bring us the girl and wipe away the debt?"
[2:15:19] <LVL1_Scumbag> Makin my way downtown~
[2:15:19] <%KeiganOfAstora> Yea, endgame clean up
[2:15:24] <Monkeyweed21> @lbrownthedestroyer White Chicks, alternatively "I'm gonna get you Sucka"
[2:15:26] <Rafraud> Youtube and Twitch handling if Nword stuff has been so bad, Parrapa just got in trouble on his channel for saying it
[2:15:28] <peachy996> @lbrownthedestroyer Can't I watch Nutty Professor instead? :(
[2:15:29] <%KeiganOfAstora> We might finish today, considering how strong Reggie is
[2:15:41] <%KeiganOfAstora> 2 hours left? They usually stop around 6 due to curfew
[2:15:42] <%X2Eliah> That sounds horrible

[2:16:03] <%A_German_spy> @KeiganOfAstora They can do it in that time if Reggie doesn't meet his match in 1-4
[2:16:04] <+king_of_beggars> What's the deal with Canadian dentists? This isn't the first time them giving non-tooth medical advice has come up.

[2:31:49] <+rubeSandwich> have they seen mask lady yet?
[2:32:01] <Equirah> @BurdRightsActivist man if only the people running the channel have specifically said they don't want spoilers in chat

[2:33:30] <DSD24> @BurdRightsActivist Dude just don't put spoilers in chat, there are other people who don't want to be spoiled either
[2:33:44] <Rafraud> You know that's fair
[2:33:49] <%krispen_wa> is the great old one the Elden ring?

[2:36:39] <%Juriasu> @Grayhammatter he stepped out for a smoke
[2:36:59] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Insanity Catalyst requires 16 Magic
[2:37:02] <andre11dr> @grayhammatter He went out for smokes and never returned
[2:37:07] <Monkeyweed21> Does Woolie know about the Talisman of Beasts that Reggie can make?
[2:37:08] <dundore77> just eat them all
[2:37:14] <+Grayhammatter> ah thanks LUL
[2:37:35] <%ekodrop> uh oh reggie can see us
[2:37:39] <Equirah> "Reggie can't read chat" HahaLean
[2:37:42] <sk8sk81> I die when I see a reddit post of someone who accidentally used the boss souls
[2:37:47] <%dreadedcthulhu> ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
[2:37:53] <%jepupu> Wow reggie's stats are all over the place
[2:38:03] <%krispen_wa> he's got decent quality stats
[2:38:10] <%Frazzyfraznor> I thought reggie couldnt read chat?
[2:38:15] <%krispen_wa> at least he still remains a faithless heathen
[2:38:16] <@Solidus_113> eat a bunch of souls to get your mana to 100
[2:38:20] <tacostarvedbeast> Imagine buffing your sword with that thing
[2:38:21] <+Stormiercashew> mine were all over the place the first time too lmak
[2:38:26] <+Stormiercashew> lmao*
[2:38:26] <%A_German_spy> @jepupu That's more or less how a spellsword quality build looks, honestly

[2:40:13] <%krispen_wa> could warding have helped him tank demon god?
[2:40:14] <Raldavar> If he really wants to min-max he'll make a sharp dex build which is only slightly weaker than a max quality build and have 20+ points to play with
[2:40:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> Bloodborne wand?

[2:41:09] <Crowroost> wait does this mean i missed old monk?
[2:41:14] <$QueequegTheater> yup

[2:41:15] <%krispen_wa> yes
[2:41:17] <%notsoy> yes, you missed it
[2:41:23] <%krispen_wa> german spy let him win
[2:41:26] <%krispen_wa> it was lame
[2:41:33] <Crowroost> RIP the run
[2:41:38] <andre11dr> Well he tried a little
[2:41:40] <dundore77> he would also need to bump his int to be able to use his light weapon since half of 97 is less 48.5
[2:41:44] <ShortAssRibs> @WoolieVersus Magic items stack too, this and the head wrap and the kris blade 20-30% each
[2:41:45] <Rafraud> The playthrough must end with Reggie winning a real PvP battle
[2:41:45] <+Grayhammatter> time to pop some souls
[2:41:46] <Rafraud> It has to
[2:41:50] <brunoberserk> it just me or woolie dont want to finish the game today ? (I don't want to rush them , just curious )
[2:41:50] <%A_German_spy> @krispen_wa I wouldn't say I let him win. I toyed with him a bit and played fair.
[2:41:51] <therealtacopancakes> who has died in the nexus?
[2:41:54] <andre11dr> Spy dosen't really do PVP
[2:42:03] <%Frazzyfraznor> Hopefully some day he'll do a magic build because I really enjoyed it
[2:42:06] <%krispen_wa> played fair with a bare fist
[2:42:10] <%cache_22> woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE
[2:42:16] <Equirah> @A_German_spy no weapon was a bit much
[2:42:23] <%notsoy> doesn't he need to boost his magic to use that catalyst?
[2:42:23] <Rafraud> He can do it
[2:42:27] <%A_German_spy> @andre11dr I used to in this game. If I'd wanted him dead, he'd have been dead, but killing him immediately didn't seem fun to watch
[2:42:29] <Rafraud> He will finish today lmao
[2:42:31] <Johannen> No weapon vs Maxed out Kalij is fair?
[2:42:36] <Rafraud> About to blow through this
[2:42:44] <%A_German_spy> @Equirah You're forgetting the automatic Homing Soul Arrow
[2:42:44] <%krispen_wa> it would have been REALLY fun to watch
[2:42:45] <%Deekman> @A_German_spy don't let them get to you. It was fun

[3:08:30] <Visorak6> Woolie you're allowed to call him blind this once without irony
[3:08:34] <Rafraud> Try Stealth
[3:08:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> literally ran right by him lmao
[3:08:46] <%Lion_kun> hey, it's the enemy in ds2
[3:08:52] <$QueequegTheater> fucken BOOMED him
[3:09:02] <Basic_Birch_> Ninja dude was probably wearing the thief ring
[3:09:33] <%Frazzyfraznor> Of course red eye knight drops grass

[3:10:11] <pmda2126> -2
[3:10:18] <BurdRightsActivist> -2\
[3:10:31] <sk8sk81> Dragon god is so broke
[3:10:35] <@Solidus_113> he got that thick protection
[3:10:53] <Crowroost> Laugh and grow fireproof
[3:11:14] <Visorak6> ???
[3:11:17] <+ReallyBigRocks> So is there not a safe midpoint there? Because it looks like the dragon has two spots he breathes on
[3:11:37] <+Grayhammatter> that grass be heavy
[3:11:43] <Rafraud> The mid is safee after the first breath
[3:11:48] <%A_German_spy> @ReallyBigRocks It's not safe. There are two separate fire zones so that you can run from one into the other without getting torched, since the dragon follows you rather than leads
[3:11:49] <gsoto83> Just gotta eat all of the grass then
[3:11:53] <Rafraud> Then you need to run second half during second breath
[3:11:53] <Crowroost> you trained for this in 1-2 Reggarth LUL
[3:12:13] <+Grayhammatter> samurai? LUL

[3:12:39] <$QueequegTheater> Woolie is not allowed to laugh
[3:12:43] <%SouLucha> Reggie needs more eyes
[3:12:43] <Rafraud> So if you have the stamina you can run straight through, otherwise it is run > pause > run
[3:12:53] <%Noonoox12> woolieFUN woolieFUN
[3:12:55] <Rafraud> And the pause is like 1 second lol
[3:12:56] <gsoto83> Reggie needs eyes... ON THE INSIDE
[3:12:56] <%A_German_spy> @ReallyBigRocks Correct. There's no time to mess with him. You just run straight past.
[3:13:04] <+Grayhammatter> he needs eyes on the inside
[3:13:08] <pmda2126> offended by looking at him

[3:14:52] <Rafraud> Reggie is going to swing on him
[3:14:52] <penitentpendant> No chance he'll get saved
[3:14:55] <%KeiganOfAstora> Was this area covered in snow before?

[3:15:04] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> ...

[3:16:18] <wantedsafe471> Good thing he didnt hit the lever
[3:16:20] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Yeah he missed that lever
[3:16:20] <+Jiggisnipe> he's very fire resistant so...
[3:16:28] <sk8sk81> Lol
[3:16:37] <therealtacopancakes> it was doing just 12 dmg I think
[3:16:37] <+MisleadingEchoes> Woolie hand holding should called attention to the lever
[3:16:38] <dundore77> and checking out the dragon setpiece
[3:16:43] <Pookiedaexzile> Thats on Woolie, He ran past the lever
[3:16:46] <Rafraud> What happens if you actually help him? I never bother cause I don't want to sit there and shoot
[3:16:58] <+MisleadingEchoes> @Rafraud nothing, just flavor text
[3:17:00] <%jepupu> To be fair Reggie missed Fool's Idol lifebars too...
[3:17:03] <Rafraud> Thought so
[3:17:18] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL he did miss the Idol's lifebars Kappa
[3:17:34] <Johannen> It took me 50 rotten arrows and about 300 heavy arrows
[3:17:34] <pmda2126> kind of
[3:17:37] <+MisleadingEchoes> The missing of the lever is frustrating to watch jesus hahahhaha
[3:18:02] <+ReallyBigRocks> Cool guy Bior is back to get slow roasted by a dragon
[3:18:11] <+MisleadingEchoes> I don't think woolie even knows about the lever

[3:18:25] <%KeiganOfAstora> How much did he lose?
[3:18:27] <BurdRightsActivist> SOULS - GONE. you could've just HIT THE LEVER
[3:18:29] <andre11dr> I never save him because, he just stands there and the dragon noise keep playing while you do the fight and it's mega annoying
[3:18:30] <%Frazzyfraznor> Its like the most useless shortcut tho

[3:18:50] <Rafraud> Lever really isn't needed for this area though lol
[3:18:54] <+MisleadingEchoes> @Noonoox12 so he is just ignoring on purpose, lol
[3:18:56] <+Jiggisnipe> it was an urban legend
[3:19:00] <Rafraud> He is strong enough to just run this
[3:19:02] <+MisleadingEchoes> @Rafraud it is to avoid all this repathing
[3:19:07] <Crowroost> Do you suffer from lever-blindness? You may be entitled to soul compensation
[3:19:08] <Pookiedaexzile> Oh no hes definitely gonna need those souls
[3:19:17] <+MisleadingEchoes> Yo state of play going soon they aren't going to watch it right?
[3:19:30] <Rafraud> True, I'm just saying he's got it down so he aint losing much on that run , you know?
[3:20:01] <%hax_metatron> Did Reggie finish 3-2?
[3:20:03] <%hax_metatron> Or leaving it for last
[3:20:10] <andre11dr> @misleadingechoes Considering Montreal curfew,no
[3:20:12] <+Grayhammatter> he finished all of 3
[3:20:12] <%jepupu> Is Woolie's TV too small or something?
[3:20:13] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Finished it
[3:20:13] <SarcFa> This is Reggie's last area
[3:20:18] <SarcFa> he finished everywhere else
[3:20:39] <+MisleadingEchoes> Woolie usually gets angry when we bother about stuff or try to backseat, so I just wanted to say this LP is by far one of my favs of all time, Woolie and Reggie are doing such stellar work and this stream and channel are incredibly good. Cheers.

[3:23:20] <dundore77> all that effort to get him here and he dies anyway.
[3:23:20] <+Jiggisnipe> Biorr is a big tough guy
[3:23:27] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> No, THAT'S Ostrava
[3:23:30] <roarofdamnation> Rip the lizard loot
[3:23:33] <+Jiggisnipe> Kappa
[3:23:36] <Rafraud> Yeah I super didn't know that was a thing, I panicked from fire too and kept running. Thats really cool
[3:23:41] <pennykettle_> I imagine most people don't finish Ostrava's quest, so they don't know that the boss isn't actually the king
[3:23:43] <stevenellis386> use your shield
[3:23:46] <Tuna_Can_0> fromsoft character interactions usually go that way FeelsBadMan

[3:24:02] <%hax_metatron> I always found his phantom easy
[3:24:07] <Crowroost> another runback
[3:24:07] <+GingerStrawhat> I mean Reggie Backstabbed him like twice and it only slightly annoyed him
[3:24:09] <%hax_metatron> But I struggled with other easier phantoms
[3:24:10] <BurdRightsActivist> What about the Key?
[3:24:13] <+robosqueeb> Makes you wonder how strong papa was monkaS
[3:24:22] <pennykettle_> And even when the crux of the game is people unable to die, the NPCs will permadie @Tuna_Can_0
[3:24:25] <brunoberserk> reggie never learned to backstab , huh ?
[3:24:28] <dundore77> He could put that key to use now
[3:24:29] <Rafraud> I was just like "why is there a key here" when I got to that part
[3:24:31] <+MisleadingEchoes> Terrible design tho, considering its the first souls its understandable.
[3:24:31] <%Javaa01> Okay but about that mausoleum
[3:24:33] <Pookiedaexzile> and That was...Bad Game Design
[3:24:54] <prime_name> And to be fair to Woolie, he had like three guys shouting at him to run.
[3:24:57] <samuelfisk> Ostrava‚Äôs juiced up on that despair.

[4:28:54] <Darren716> The cat?
[4:28:55] <%ChoculaUltra> You were my brother! I loved you FeelsBadMan
[4:28:55] <%Noonoox12> woolieSMUG woolieSMUG
[4:28:59] <Lefteron> But Freke and some other are still here. Did they change it from the original?
[4:29:02] <wantedsafe471> If you did know about him, you'd never of opened his cell
[4:29:08] <Crowroost> You dont know whatcha messin'wiff
[4:29:08] <%KeiganOfAstora> his armor
[4:29:09] <pennykettle_> probably because hes at the end
[4:29:11] <linSP> he killed the apprentice and the bowl cut
[4:29:14] <pennykettle_> so they skip to the end of the quest?
[4:29:15] <penitentpendant> Runic weapon/shield too
[4:29:17] <%ChoculaUltra> Gloom gang
[4:29:18] <+Sharmanyx> its such a cool armor set
[4:29:18] <%Noonoox12> Maybe it auto-triggers upon killing the Allant?
[4:29:21] <+Grayhammatter> gloom armor
[4:29:21] <TheBlackestBaron> Is it because he killed Allant?
[4:29:24] <ronin19xx> Coolest armour
[4:29:25] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[4:29:26] <+Jiggisnipe> you didn't Reggie don't lie
[4:29:27] <peachy996> @linSP Nothing Valuable was lost
[4:29:31] <%SouLucha> Just let YURT do his thing, eh?!
[4:29:33] <Monkeyweed21> Its cuz he unlocked the Monumental
[4:29:33] <Rafraud> REALLY COMPLACANT HUH
[4:29:35] <Lefteron> So the aprentices were murdered
[4:29:44] <Darren716> Man getting rid of hold limits was the smartest thing they ever did
[4:29:49] <tacostarvedbeast> I love how woolie grabbed the mic just now he‚Äôs been waiting for this
[4:30:00] <venomfury86> reminds me of "that guy" in Bloodborne
[4:30:05] <linSP> yurt will RUIN your game
[4:30:11] <dundore77> every time you return after a boss
[4:30:12] <Crowroost> Why did he go for Reggarth when there were still hub NPCs left? because reg was human?
[4:30:13] <+Jiggisnipe> every time you kill a boss
[4:30:13] <%KeiganOfAstora> Yurt will kill an NPC in the following order: Freke's Apprentice Acolyte of God and Worshipper of God Patches Saint Urbain Sage Freke Yuria
[4:30:16] <@Solidus_113> It's every time after a boss
[4:30:31] <wantedsafe471> You got lucky
[4:30:34] <BlackermanZX> WOW whant an asshole
[4:30:39] <%KeiganOfAstora> Their regular Drops will be found in their spot.
[4:30:49] <%bread_assassin> I don't think he kills Stockpile Thomas
[4:30:50] <%Euphbugg> LUL
[4:30:55] <%ChoculaUltra> even Thomas?!
[4:31:01] <@Solidus_113> you're super lucky you decided to do world 3 last
[4:31:01] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus That's correct
[4:31:04] <Klefth> No, not Thomas
[4:31:05] <linSP> good thing we saved yurt at the end
[4:31:08] <%hologram_sam> HA
[4:31:08] <+Jiggisnipe> he kills the magic people
[4:31:09] <%Deekman> @A_German_spy will he take out Thomas?
[4:31:09] <CoffeeSlice> lmao
[4:31:12] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[4:31:12] <%ChoculaUltra> oh phew
[4:31:12] <%nakunattakage> kmaBlush
[4:31:13] <lbrownthedestroyer> Thomas dies but th invenotry is still there
[4:31:14] <%Irridium> LUL
[4:31:16] <%KeiganOfAstora> The death of Saint Urbain will make it impossible to learn or memorize different Miracles for the rest of the playthrough. The death of Yuria, Sage Freke and his Apprentice will make it impossible to learn or memorize different Magic Spells for the rest of the playthrough @WoolieVersus
[4:31:16] <%JustYudha> LUL
[4:31:17] <Monkeyweed21> not thomes
[4:31:19] <%A_German_spy> @Deekman No
[4:31:23] <penitentpendant> "The Boletarean Screw Job!?"
[4:31:23] <mesamus> WOOLIE twitter has gone insane, looma t all FF7 news
[4:31:27] <venomfury86> welcome to Souls games
[4:31:34] <pennykettle_> I feel like the first time I heard about Demon's Souls, Yurt was pitched as an NPC that could make the game unbeatable if not taken care of
[4:31:34] <andre11dr> This game is the best
[4:31:39] <Futurecity10> He kills, Freke's Apprentice, The Acolyte of God, Patches, Saint urbain, Sage Freke, Yuria
[4:31:41] <BlackermanZX> reggarth released a big murderer
[4:31:46] <%SouLucha> Reggie won't kill people, he's a good boi, he'll let the others do it for him.
[4:31:51] <andre11dr> My second favorite Souls game after Bloodborne
[4:31:54] <Lefteron> He wants to erase the knowledge of the soul arts
[4:31:54] <%RyTYoung> :O :O :O
[4:32:06] <andre11dr> Because cool ass shit like this
[4:32:12] <wantedsafe471> Thats how pat killed him, i think
[4:32:14] <linSP> oops yurt took a tumble
[4:32:17] <%KeiganOfAstora> It's like Lautrec all over again
[4:32:19] <%notsoy> well he just killed the apprentices, thankfully
[4:32:19] <venomfury86> PULL THE LEVER
[4:32:29] <+cvp5127> LUL
[4:32:31] <%Deekman> @WoolieVersus can we reload the zone and see Mephistophiles?
[4:32:35] <peachy996> Yurt likes to do two things: Chill & Kill
[4:32:52] <Lefteron> You can see he is a mage however
[4:32:52] <Johannen> @Deekman I think you need Black tendency character for that
[4:32:53] <%ChoculaUltra> Thomas looking around watching everyone getting got, sighing in relief LUL
[4:33:05] <MadBaller123> Yurt can't hurt that face
[4:33:05] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1364103397230718976?s=19
[4:33:06] <sendart> patches also warns you about him
[4:33:08] <%Deekman> @Johannen oh weird
[4:33:15] <%A_German_spy> @KeiganOfAstora Yurt is the original Lautrec
[4:33:17] <+Jiggisnipe> probably cuz no bosses left
[4:33:18] <%KeiganOfAstora> Yup
[4:33:26] <%KeiganOfAstora> @WoolieVersus If Yurt is killed, once the player achieves Pure Black Character Tendency, Mephistopheles will appear in the Nexus, tasking the player with killing all the NPC that Yurt would have otherwise murdered.
[4:33:27] <Crowroost> Probably happened because there's no bosses left
[4:33:32] <Rafraud> It might be cause there are no bosses
[4:33:37] <MadBaller123> They could've added an extra line for this situation
[4:33:42] <%SouLucha> Best friend Patches!
[4:33:58] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Yuria specifically warns you that he wears a helmet with two big-ass horns
[4:33:58] <%Noonoox12> @WoolieVersus read Keigan's highlighted message
[4:34:07] <ronin19xx> Archstoon
[4:34:08] <slix3431> INVADE now!
[4:34:09] <wantedsafe471> Wait, how did yurt get into the nexus without anyone seeing him?
[4:34:11] <%ThisIsLloyd> burgers and fries
[4:34:17] <slix3431> INVADE
[4:34:21] <linSP> yuria also warns you about yurt
[4:34:22] <slix3431> Awwww
[4:34:30] <+Jiggisnipe> lol
[4:34:33] <slix3431> Give us one fight
[4:34:37] <%jepupu> That place would have been THE scraping spear griefer spot.
[4:34:38] <slix3431> One oh shit moment
[4:34:53] <andre11dr> The boss is dead can't invade
[4:35:02] <slix3431> Damn
[4:35:05] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus She won't be here. You need Pure Black Character Tendency first.
[4:35:08] <Basic_Birch_> @A_German_spy Isn't patches the one that tells you about the horns?
[4:35:11] <Lefteron> You must have pure black character.... tendancy
[4:35:22] <%jepupu> Character tendency, yeah
[4:35:28] <Monkeyweed21> Reggarth isnt black enough
[4:35:30] <andre11dr> Mephistopheles doesn't show up unless your pure black yeah
[4:35:45] <%A_German_spy> @Basic_Birch_It's Yuria. Patches tells you he wears black armor
[4:35:52] <BlackermanZX> reggarth the evil wooliePOYO
[4:36:00] <KaiserMario> Did Reggie get the friend ring from Monumental?
[4:36:06] <%Deekman> end yurt, become yurt
[4:36:11] <%KeiganOfAstora> DS2 did a better job with this concept. You had the option to not kill them but present an item as proof of death
[4:36:30] <dundore77> its "possible" but theres alot of work involved iirc
[4:36:30] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus You're absolutely right! That's why there's New Game+
[4:36:30] <ronin19xx> And thats the beauty of it
[4:36:31] <%KeiganOfAstora> For that guy in Aldia's Keep
[4:36:39] <Murdercles> rewards are all crap in this game though LUL
[4:36:42] <slix3431> Yurt is dead. Long live the Yurt!
[4:36:52] <%KeiganOfAstora> Yurt brings the hurut
[4:36:54] <%KeiganOfAstora> hurt*
[4:36:55] <andre11dr> Also you barely touched invasions
[4:37:13] <peachy996> Can you beg for a life lesson, Apprentice?
[4:37:25] <andre11dr> You can get the Robes if you win ass Old Monk
[4:37:32] <pennykettle_> LUL ResidentSleeper

[4:38:37] <Lefteron> FARM SOME MORE, UPGRADE ALL TYPES
[4:38:46] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus You can do that in NG+, but you can't summon in the final area
[4:38:49] <%Noonoox12> @WoolieVersus try out being the yellow king?
[4:38:57] <legion0047> @woolieversus Ostrava and Yurt lore remains unread
[4:39:00] <andre11dr> Go to 3-2 if you want to do pvp
[4:39:03] <Lefteron> Get summoned by the Yellow Monk
[4:39:21] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus If you have a password active, you can be invaded normally even in an area where you've already beaten the boss.
[4:39:31] <+Jiggisnipe> read the lore Yurt and Ostrava

[4:40:58] <Lefteron> @WoolieVersus "Freke, you are going down a path I can't follow. You are breaking my heart :("
[4:41:03] <pennykettle_> I thought he took the password off
[4:41:20] <+Deekman> I thought they changed it in the PS5 version so invasions CAN still happen? Am I crazy
[4:41:24] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus You can totally be invaded here. Just set a password
[4:41:26] <%Noonoox12> @WoolieVersus put on a password for invasions without a boss
[4:41:38] <sendart> you have to put the password on if no boss
[4:41:41] <+Jiggisnipe> you can try and be a boss
[4:41:41] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus You need a password active to be invaded in an area with no boss left. Just use any password

[4:55:48] <Lefteron> @WoolieVersus "The alpha and the omega. Our creator. And our destroyer"
[4:55:49] <Beethings> I really like how the birds look just as shitty as the original
[4:55:50] <%Irridium> JPEG birds LUL

[4:56:22] <Fabpsi_> "come now" - "barf barf *spits demon and pure evil *
[4:56:23] <+ReallyBigRocks> It really was Slug Souls all along
[4:56:23] <Crowroost> Filthy, DIRTY Old One

[4:58:05] <pennykettle_> this is elden ring
[4:58:07] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus So notice how all the structures here look like they're melted? That's what the fog eventually does. That's how it "erases" the world. It just corrodes reality itself.
[4:58:11] <linSP> where‚Äôs gael
[4:58:13] <ronin19xx> I wonder that used to be here

[4:58:36] <+vaderxyz1970> Birds aren't real Woolie
[4:58:38] <ronin19xx> Interesting
[4:58:38] <Lobster_Lord> you guys hear about PlayStation closing their internal Japanese studio? they worked on this game and Bloodborne.
[4:58:39] <Fabpsi_> birds are immune to the fog
[4:58:43] <%Deekman> @A_German_spy never picked up on that, neat!

[4:58:57] <Crowroost> "Woolie am I a demon?" - Reggie 2021
[4:58:59] <%A_German_spy> @pennykettle_ No, he's killing everyone so that there's nobody left alive who knows about the Soul Arts.
[4:59:00] <wantedsafe471> Its so there are no more users of magic, which comes from the old one

[4:59:28] <%A_German_spy> @bread_assassin In the bad ending, the player takes King Allant's place as the Old One's top minion, and eventually the whole world ends up like this

[5:10:43] <%Deekman> @WoolieVersus and they added the coins!
[5:10:47] <+eanscrale> you can even never level upand go to +7 if you're realy crazy
[5:10:49] <Fabpsi_> how does it work with invasions on NG+7? Are people still about pvp on that point?
[5:10:56] <SixthShinx> F
[5:11:02] <Crowroost> F
[5:11:04] <%Noonoox12> @Fabpsi_ PVP is relative to your current level
[5:11:04] <supergoblinpunch> NG+ is for real

[5:11:08] <+Grayhammatter> F
[5:11:10] <BerryliciousDefinition> F
[5:11:10] <%Irridium> BibleThump
[5:11:11] <+eanscrale> pvp is just based on sl
[5:11:12] <%A_German_spy> @Fabpsi_ It doesn't matter what game cycle you're in for PvP. Anyone can interact with other players in any NG+ cycle
[5:11:16] <chaos4ever181> F in the chat
[5:11:23] <Fabpsi_> ahhhh, gotcha. Thanks!
[5:11:24] <%cobalt_phoenix_> F

[5:11:34] <+FuqBoiSlim> Rest in peace Andrew
[5:11:38] <lbrownthedestroyer> F
[5:11:39] <Fabpsi_> (really should more focus on pvp, always put it aside in those games)
[5:12:06] <andre11dr> I went up to 35 on my main character, I really REALLY like this game, and i always believed that a Remake would make it on par with Bloodborne for me,and it got close
[5:12:09] <%Feralspirit41> Now for dark 1
[5:12:14] <peachy996> It only gets better
[5:12:15] <Darren716> Dark 1 is a nice solid length
[5:12:15] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Oh my god dark souls 2 is forever
[5:12:16] <pennykettle_> my first DS1 playthrough was like 200 hours
[5:12:19] <%A_German_spy> @Fabpsi_ He's got a taste of PvP now, and he's even 3 for 0. I suspect he'll dip his toes in again.
[5:12:20] <arkvc> now if we could get that fuckin 60fps bloodboner...
[5:12:26] <Darren716> 2 is like twice as long as it should be
[5:12:27] <peachy996> Then it doesn't when DS2 happens but then picks back
[5:12:27] <@Solidus_113> no nexus
[5:12:30] <Johannen> Please dont play DS1 Remake
[5:12:31] <%A_German_spy> @Fabpsi_ *3 for 3, rather
[5:12:37] <pennykettle_> and you have to memorize the map FeelsGoodMan
[5:12:42] <Darren716> DS1 remastered on switch is fine actually
[5:12:49] <+FuqBoiSlim> I think my first bloodborne playthough was like 40-50 hours lol
[5:12:52] <pyjama_day> I think my first Demons Souls run took me 17-18 hours? And roughly 12 hours for every run after that. 8 if i'm rushing. So very replayable
[5:12:57] <+FuqBoiSlim> not including the dlc
[5:12:58] <andre11dr> And DS2 and DS3 are massive with the DLC
[5:13:03] <Darren716> Like it's the closest to the original with the added QoL
[5:13:03] <Johannen> @Darren716 Yeah that one is good, unlike all other version
[5:13:06] <%Frazzyfraznor> Thanks for the entertainment fellas, its been ablast watching Reggie get gud
[5:13:09] <Fabpsi_> oh yea, I think reggie had a lot of fun, just look at him. So much joy^^
[5:13:11] <%Feralspirit41> My first ds1 playthrough was probably 20 hours
[5:13:12] <danknugglit> Woke
[5:13:14] <Visorak6> And this is one of five games
[5:13:17] <BlackermanZX> man Bloodborne is amazing
[5:13:20] <dundore77> demons souls never really got "hype" Dark souls was the big one
[5:13:20] <therealtacopancakes> DS is just such a good game
[5:13:21] <%A_German_spy> @Fabpsi_ Yeah, that's a face of satisfaction
[5:13:22] <pennykettle_> 2009, the good old days
[5:13:28] <ronin19xx> Hopefully he has the desire to play DS
[5:13:28] <+Jiggisnipe> dw alot people missed DeS
[5:13:29] <arkvc> 09 was good shit
[5:13:30] <andre11dr> Yeah this is still my second favorite one ,i put it over DS1
[5:13:31] <danknugglit> Bloodborne <3
[5:13:39] <%rasamune> 12 years ago, fuck
[5:13:41] <Crowroost> Gotta take Reggie through it chronologically, to make up for your own messed-up line, Woolie
[5:13:43] <arkvc> so... dark souls or bloodborne next?
[5:13:44] <Lefteron> @WoolieVersus Congrats Reggie, you are now a souls fan too, also known as a masochist
[5:13:47] <@Solidus_113> "get this boring low fantasy out of my face"
[5:13:49] <peachy996> Back when BB was called Beast Souls
[5:13:55] <JetpackMcQuack> localization SourPls
[5:13:56] <pennykettle_> Dark Souls with GUNS
[5:13:56] <arkvc> we need to go LOWER
[5:14:03] <bobxmaker> i think reggie would love sekiro
[5:14:07] <+FuqBoiSlim> High Fantasy ResidentSleeper
[5:14:07] <andre11dr> Bloodborne is it's own beast
[5:14:15] <%HootNebula> gg Reggie!
[5:14:20] <Darren716> Was Reggie on the original Sekiro LP?
[5:14:21] <dundore77> This is just the prototype too. Every game builds on this
[5:14:37] <Basic_Birch_> I know you won't be promising any other playthroughs, but Reggie vs ds1 would be so great at some point!
[5:14:48] <petwisk> i can't with this name
[5:14:52] <andre11dr> Im a huge fan of Storm King
[5:14:53] <%Double_Tap_That> Snorlax and Pikachu

[5:15:02] <twoto858> Biggie and Smalls
[5:15:04] <%Deekman> ok, on to Dark Souls Remastered lol
[5:15:06] <+freystreams> Four kings on ng+ still haunts me
[5:15:08] <Jashter18> O&S vs Reg would be the funniest shit
[5:15:09] <JetpackMcQuack> not fair :(
[5:15:10] <%Deekman> he's got the bug now
[5:15:11] <+FuqBoiSlim> @twoto858 jinx
[5:15:14] <Johannen> Snorlax and Pikachu Kreygasm
[5:15:15] <Fabpsi_> @A_German_spy exactly! It can be difficult to get into this type of game, but I think that Woolie did a great job coaching and "tipping" him into the right direction when it was needed. Furthermore it was a great addition that you were always around, ready to help even more. Don't wanna go on about it too much, but...yea, great game, great streams, great job y'all
[5:15:19] <ChungusQuest> Don't forget Fool's Idol: the Joke Boss Archetype
[5:15:20] <Rafraud> great playthrough
[5:15:21] <peachy996> This boss inflicts Status Affects on you, have fun
[5:15:22] <Darren716> I think the biggest change for Reggie may be the total switch to open world rather than the hub world set up
[5:15:22] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[5:15:28] <therealtacopancakes> I will miss this stream :(
[5:15:29] <ronin19xx> Alonne
[5:15:30] <penitentpendant> Artorius introducing "Flips and Shit"
[5:15:36] <%emperordread> You did great at False King Reggie
[5:15:38] <%krispen_wa> Oh shit i just popped in
[5:15:45] <%JustYudha> Oooo I wonder what's next
[5:15:46] <Darren716> Artorias walked for Maria could run
[5:15:50] <Darren716> *so
[5:15:53] <%krispen_wa> how many times did he die to False King?
[5:15:55] <%JustYudha> What game will replace Demon Souls LP
[5:15:56] <andre11dr> King was hard wall on my first playthrough
[5:15:59] <%Deekman> can you Parry Alant?
[5:15:59] <pennykettle_> now drop him into orphan of kos
[5:16:00] <peachy996> Maria doesn't technically run
[5:16:02] <+Jiggisnipe> 3?
[5:16:08] <Crowroost> The line from Fool's Idol to Pinwheel is like a few centimeters long
[5:16:10] <%A_German_spy> @Fabpsi_ Heh, I can't take any credit... I'm just a particularly involved and enthusiastic bystander. This was Reggie and Woolie's show from the start, and I've enjoyed every minute.
[5:16:18] <ronin19xx> This is some nice art
[5:16:21] <%krispen_wa> Also did he figure out Yurt's deal?
[5:16:22] <%A_German_spy> @Deekman No, you can't
[5:16:26] <Fabpsi_> hehe, true that^^
[5:16:46] <%Double_Tap_That> Git Gud
[5:16:48] <+eanscrale> "acquire skill"
[5:16:52] <penitentpendant> @krispen_wa It was explained after 2 victims and Yurt triggering his battle
[5:16:54] <pennykettle_> the old game music was cronchy
[5:17:03] <%ekodrop> this was fun, hope there's more
[5:17:07] <Visorak6> I really hope for reggie vs dark souls or BB in the future
[5:17:07] <%A_German_spy> @Deekman Which is why he was such a perfect final boss for this game compared to what DS1 got. They tried to do the same thing in DS1, but that particular mistake kneecapped it
[5:17:08] <+Sharmanyx> @A_German_spy Btw I loved your Franz fine dining segments back in the day!

[5:17:22] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Are you kidding? I wouldn't miss this! You did fantastic, Woolie. And you too, Reggie!
[5:17:22] <%krispen_wa> wait i thought yurt only fights you if you're the only one left?
[5:17:24] <pennykettle_> @A_German_spy do you have a favourite souls game
[5:17:24] <andre11dr> Oh a godlike track is coming up
[5:17:29] <Basic_Birch_> Tell Reggie of the other ending theme!
[5:17:29] <peachy996> You were a good teacher Woolie
[5:17:30] <%RyTYoung> You did good bean dad
[5:17:32] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus I'm overjoyed that I could help even a little.

[5:19:02] <ronin19xx> Welcome to souls storytelling
[5:19:03] <Fabpsi_> Soooooo, Reggie wants to go back in, that is a good sign... pretty please more of this^^
[5:19:07] <chaos4ever181> Maiden Astriea is still amazing
[5:19:07] <Darren716> And Reggie just remember, the best is yet to come
[5:19:12] <+Grayhammatter> didn't even need a map
[5:19:16] <+cvp5127> reggie had the optimal experience
[5:19:17] <danknugglit> I got a costco bundle two months ago
[5:19:24] <Fabpsi_> map is easy mode, no need for a map, lol
[5:19:24] <pennykettle_> Some of the fun of this game is actually NOT having a explainer. You play the game and it's weird but good, and then you find out there's a ton of information you never would have figured out
[5:19:26] <GothicCrusader> When Reggie vs Dark Souls?
[5:19:28] <%megaman_sentinel> his wife was a witch right
[5:19:28] <ChungusQuest> @krispen_wa The Old One was lulled back to its slumber
[5:19:29] <peachy996> If you ever want to do another one, I strongly suggest Bloodborne for a different gameplay experience
[5:19:30] <existingdark> So Reggie, you ready to hit New Game and go for a new build? Can't Stop Won't Stop
[5:19:30] <ronin19xx> Environmental storyterlling
[5:19:43] <peachy996> Dark Souls is best saved for last
[5:19:49] <%krispen_wa> Play Nioh 2 now
[5:19:59] <Lefteron> When are we going for the pure black run?
[5:20:03] <andre11dr> But the song
[5:20:04] <Darren716> Cant save Dark 1 for last just because of how the systems evolved
[5:20:16] <Darren716> Would be wonky to go from 8 way back to 4
[5:20:21] <roarofdamnation> @GothicCrusader YES!
[5:20:21] <+Sharmanyx> @Lefteron I thought we were already doing it Kappa
[5:20:27] <%bread_assassin> When‚Äôs the Disco Elysium patch coming again?
[5:20:29] <GothicCrusader> Cant save DS 1 for last because DS3 is a continuation
[5:20:29] <peachy996> Yeah but fuck Dark lol Go BB
[5:20:44] <%krispen_wa> Play Armored Core now
[5:20:47] <penitentpendant> The noodliest arms, the biggest spells

[5:23:14] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus karacoKlap karacoKlap karacoKlap karacoKlap karacoKlap
[5:23:15] <+Jiggisnipe> Is it the lore of the tree?
[5:23:18] <%RyTYoung> WHAT DIDN'T KNOW THAT
[5:23:27] <+FuqBoiSlim> Japan Studios PepeHands
[5:23:30] <danknugglit> PAT
[5:23:34] <SixthShinx> V? What's his save doing there?
[5:23:36] <seniormeatbox> PAT?
[5:23:39] <Fabpsi_> big Boi, big sword, big shield!
[5:23:55] <Lobster_Lord> King Al
[5:24:09] <%rasamune> There it is
[5:24:09] <ToneBacas> become the PAT
[5:24:19] <danknugglit> So i did a bit of grinding offscreen
[5:24:20] <%krispen_wa> kill him with WORDS
[5:24:22] <%Irridium> Maybe if Sony actually marketed Japan Studios' games instead of sending them out to die they'd sell better.
[5:24:25] <%krispen_wa> TALISMAN OF BEASTS
[5:24:26] <roarofdamnation> Talisman of the beast, he has killed people
[5:24:27] <%A_German_spy> Ahh, the Talisman of Beasts
[5:24:28] <%Irridium> yes I am still man over Gravity Rush 2
[5:24:28] <+Jiggisnipe> he gets sad cuz you're better FeelsBadMan
[5:24:34] <%Irridium> >:(
[5:24:58] <%krispen_wa> It's the proto-Pyro build
[5:25:00] <pennykettle_> it looks a bit familiar doesnt it
[5:25:03] <Fabpsi_> now the religion gets destroyed
[5:25:05] <%krispen_wa> proto-Hex
[5:25:11] <+Jiggisnipe> wonder why that is
[5:25:18] <Fabpsi_> because it is all the same^^
[5:25:20] <+cvp5127> gods anus
[5:25:23] <BurdRightsActivist> FEAR-al
[5:25:32] <Fabpsi_> all is slug, there is no difference
[5:25:34] <pennykettle_> the church is evil in every souls game lol
[5:25:42] <Crowroost> Aplogogize to Freke
[5:26:11] <andre11dr> miracles and sorcery is the same shit
[5:26:13] <+Jiggisnipe> faith and magic come from the same source
[5:26:16] <%RyTYoung> huh
[5:26:17] <+FuqBoiSlim> HMMMMM
[5:26:38] <%krispen_wa> and thats why miracles suck, because its a jank version of the truth
[5:26:39] <ToneBacas> we solved religion!
[5:26:40] <+cvp5127> religion LUL
[5:26:47] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[5:26:47] <Lefteron> Our creator...and our destroyer
[5:26:50] <therealtacopancakes> we judas bible here
[5:26:50] <%cobalt_phoenix_> WHAT A GAME
[5:26:55] <%A_German_spy> karacoLOL
[5:26:56] <danknugglit> Hallelujah
[5:27:03] <@Solidus_113> the god of universal truths
[5:27:06] <%Ether101_Prime> Somebody was ripping off Warhammer.
[5:27:10] <brunoberserk> RETURN TO SLUG
[5:27:12] <+Jiggisnipe> learning DeS lore back in the day was fantastic
[5:27:25] <twoah> Bibble games? On THIS channel?
[5:27:25] <Monkeyweed21> Don't forget about the Spell you get from the Maiden in Black @WoolieVersus
[5:27:27] <peachy996> Maybe we all like Mother Kos
[5:27:28] <ToneBacas> maybe you like chocolate icecream, and maybe i like vanilla icecream, but in the end it's all icecream
[5:27:39] <pennykettle_> How soon after this came out did people start to go "wait there's a lot of info here..."
[5:27:41] <Lefteron> @WoolieVersus What is interesting is that the mages use the demons souls to replicate their power while the miracles do the reverse
[5:27:41] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Earn that yourself, Reggie!
[5:27:43] <roarofdamnation> Unless you are Freke in which case is not mysterious, you just know what it is, and you will use it for human potential.
[5:27:44] <FrostedZaibatsu> Now KILL them all Reggie
[5:27:46] <@Moobot> Easy with the emojis @mtlsars
[5:27:47] <peachy996> You kill her super hard
[5:27:49] <Visorak6> You step on her skull
[5:27:50] <pennykettle_> you CRUSH her
[5:27:58] <pepinillomaton> Oh shit, did he finish the game?
[5:27:59] <%megaman_sentinel> so him the video
[5:28:01] <andre11dr> Alternative ending is BIG CURBSTOMP
[5:28:03] <therealtacopancakes> Reggie outed as gnostic
[5:28:04] <+Sir_Louis> Woolie has stopped responding
[5:28:16] <+penjaza> It's right there
[5:28:20] <Lefteron> You can get the soul SUCC spell
[5:28:21] <%megaman_sentinel> someone link it
[5:28:26] <Equirah> You become the slug
[5:28:34] <NumbF4ke> The stomp is so good
[5:28:34] <Equirah> oh wait, wrong game LUL
[5:28:39] <pennykettle_> He probably will earn the ending for himself
[5:28:39] <%krispen_wa> It's the most unambiguously evil ending in Souls
[5:28:47] <CoffeeSlice> you make her go cromch
[5:28:58] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Whole world gets covered in fog and consumed
[5:29:03] <penitentpendant> That Dark Souls 3 Stomp Ending though
[5:29:04] <ChungusQuest> seriously, that stomp is VICIOUS and I really want to see Reggie's reaction
[5:29:08] <andre11dr> You get the red sign and her soul which you can use to get Soul Suck, which is the same spell Allant was using
[5:29:11] <Basic_Birch_> Also better music
[5:29:19] <%krispen_wa> a world covered in fog...OH GOD IS THIS JUST P4?!
[5:29:19] <BlackermanZX> ye should check it
[5:29:49] <%megaman_sentinel> it a must see
[5:29:49] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1364103397230718976?s=19
[5:29:50] <andre11dr> Maiden used to the Old Ones strongest demon, but now that's Allant
[5:29:52] <%SouLucha> THIS IS FINE
[5:29:53] <Monkeyweed21> Check the spell you get from her Soul @WoolieVersus
[5:29:57] <Darren716> kanye.png
[5:30:06] <%Double_Tap_That> @WoolieVersus You could mention that the Maiden's soul gives you the soul suck spell
[5:30:07] <%nakunattakage> but what if it was MAGICAL heroin? limesThink
[5:30:07] <%Ether101_Prime> That's why you never go to the Dark Side.
[5:30:19] <%A_German_spy> karacoLOL

[5:31:15] <+Grayhammatter> impossible LUL
[5:31:16] <%SainEdge> never Kappa
[5:31:19] <@Solidus_113> good work Sword +5
[5:31:22] <Visorak6> They're absolutely overhyped but they are certainly a lot more difficult than most games
[5:31:25] <Jashter18> GG Reggie GG you did it!
[5:31:28] <dundore77> they are so "unfair" too
[5:31:30] <+cvp5127> thanks sword
[5:31:30] <roarofdamnation> Alright now Reggie vs DS 1
[5:31:33] <+penjaza> When's Dark Souls?
[5:31:35] <dundunsun> woolieKICKDAD woolieKICKDAD woolieKICKDAD
[5:31:38] <%krispen_wa> nowadays i feel like games are actually getting a bit harder though
[5:31:39] <%superc37> real talk tho the souls games are easy as shit theyre just rly fkin obtuse
[5:31:46] <andre11dr> When they first came out it was that hard
[5:31:48] <@Solidus_113> cool spoilers bro
[5:31:52] <Johannen> Is it possible to run DS on Xbox One or its not in thier "compatability" list?
[5:32:00] <Basic_Birch_> Woolie sounding like a casul lol
[5:32:06] <arkvc> yeah real smooth
[5:32:15] <arkvc> weird flex
[5:32:18] <Lefteron> You didnt get summoned as a boss though :(
[5:32:23] <+Swerto> Mirror Knight in Dark Souls 2
[5:32:23] <peachy996> I prefer BB's version
[5:32:24] <syanplague> 2 has it
[5:32:29] <andre11dr> It never worked as good as Old Monk tho
[5:32:30] <Darren716> Honestly for DS1 the switch version may be the best
[5:32:36] <+Sharmanyx> ye boi and its done with the curved sword moveset
[5:32:37] <%ozzrabbit> @Solidus_113 is that ever comes to pass, it'll be years in the future and he'll probably have forgotten about this message by then
[5:32:51] <Nyckelus> @johannen It‚Äôs backwards compatible. DS:R as well.
[5:32:54] <Octopimp> good games, woolie. i never got to tell you B)
[5:33:01] <@Solidus_113> can't always count on that
[5:33:04] <Fabpsi_> speaking about spoilers (not gonna spoil anything here, no worries): overall Reggie dodged a lot of spoilers so far! Very nice work. It helped a lot to keep his own experience so pure (and this is always amazing because reggies reactions are just so real and so great to watch. Pure Hype)
[5:33:22] <+Jiggisnipe> oops all curb stomps
[5:33:23] <%krispen_wa> The DS3 one is good
[5:33:33] <%Noonoox12> @Fabpsi_ Reggie is such a pure boi
[5:33:55] <SixthShinx> That reflection behind Reggie is cool
[5:33:56] <Afrosamasenpai> IT'S SPY, YOU KNOW HE HAS TOO
[5:33:56] <Johannen> So its either OG PC version,Switch or 360 on XBONE
[5:33:58] <%superc37> @solidus_113 i mean knowing reggie yeah he'll probably forget it since at the like the absolute ass end of the series. plus it aint evn that much of a spoiler
[5:33:59] <andre11dr> Praise the sun
[5:34:00] <Fabpsi_> yea, the only good boi in the demons souls universe
[5:34:01] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus You guys gave me a ton of entertainment. This is my thanks!
[5:34:05] <SeniorTop> Reggie, are you going to do the rest of the souls series now? This is quality content.
[5:34:08] <dundore77> Also Reggie did very good at not grinding. just went through with what he got from bosses. First time i played Demons souls i grinding to an absurd level to make up for my lack of skill
[5:34:15] <@Solidus_113> It's content in a game he hasn't played
[5:34:17] <Lefteron> UMBASA
[5:34:31] <%ozzrabbit> @Solidus_113 I'm just an unknown viewer, and there's no guarantee he'll ever play the other games on a stream. Plus, there's no guarantee I'll actually matchmake if he ever gets to that point.
[5:34:32] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus It's been a pleasure being here!
[5:34:37] <bobxmaker> the first time is allways magical
[5:34:38] <Darren716> I just know the switch one has a few qol changes like the new bonfire and being able to quick select estus
[5:34:41] <%megaman_sentinel> Umbasa praise the sun
[5:34:45] <existingdark> Reggie must continue the series and eventually pass the torch. This is the way.
[5:35:32] <ashuckel> 360 no scope DBS
[5:35:33] <Darren716> Holy shit I can't believe it's been nearly 7 years since Woolie started the Souls series
[5:35:35] <%SouLucha> !! LIFE AT RISK !!
[5:35:43] <Visorak6> There also exists a thing called dead angling where you can swing behind someone's block
[5:35:46] <Darren716> Just realized how long it's been
[5:35:47] <andre11dr> Yeah the jank of this game kinda makes it funer
[5:35:53] <%superc37> @solidus_113 content that is ultimately inconciquential in the grand scheme of things. not to mention that again, its such a small comment that he probably wont be remember it unless someone reminds him of it.
[5:35:54] <emeraldskrull> I like smoked gouda....
[5:36:03] <%Euphbugg> LUL
[5:36:04] <arkvc> technically reggie isn't meme status yet
[5:36:10] <arkvc> demon souls was never the meme
[5:36:12] <%Noonoox12> ! TOXIC !
[5:36:13] <arkvc> dark souls is
[5:36:17] <therealtacopancakes> got gud
[5:36:19] <Ner234> Toxic Reggie D:
[5:36:21] <A_German_spy> karacoLOL
[5:36:23] <%Irridium> ! TOXIC !
[5:36:23] <roarofdamnation> No one was voting them
[5:36:25] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[5:36:32] <Visorak6> You broke the treaty
[5:36:44] <andre11dr> Like invading as Old Monk and push locking people till they disconnect is a magic that not many games bring me
[5:36:58] <roarofdamnation> He spared the one with 1 voting tho
[5:36:58] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[5:37:17] <Monkeyweed21> now beat Sekiro
[5:37:21] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Amen! You knocked this out of the park, Woolie.
[5:37:22] <Jashter18> Woolie did PERFECT
[5:37:23] <ronin19xx> You did great Woolz
[5:37:36] <Arkfyre> Reggie vs. Dark Souls when?
[5:37:36] <arkvc> uh lore runs are based, who was shitting on woolie?
[5:37:42] <ronin19xx> Merely experimentation
[5:37:48] <+cvp5127> should have let him penetrator himself
[5:38:00] <andre11dr> There was less death to gravity than i ever have, so GGs
[5:38:01] <Darren716> It's best to get the most lore possible when doing an lp
[5:38:11] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I used to get summoned to fight sinners in DS2 and whip them to death dual mundane old whips
[5:38:19] <arkvc> kinky
[5:38:23] <dundore77> you were fine. You let reggie make mistakes and how you wouldn't say anything during bosses until needed
[5:38:23] <Crowroost> Now Reggie needs a magic run for the superior way to play the game
[5:38:39] <peachy996> BB is pretty simple
[5:38:41] <Rafraud> I think you did great tbh @WoolieVersus
[5:38:46] <Visorak6> Bloodborne is honestly fine to play blind
[5:38:48] <%Noonoox12> @WoolieVersus Time call in VaatiVidya!
[5:38:54] <andre11dr> I know Bloodborne and DS3 kinda
[5:39:00] <Zayasu> do you not wanna do blind lp's?
[5:39:01] <SarcFa> There's always gonna be someone complaining about something with the runs, honestly your mentoring method worked really well with Reggie
