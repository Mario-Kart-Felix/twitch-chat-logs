[0:01:54] <LVL1_Scumbag> Just one?
[0:01:58] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @twistedtapioca you should play it. It's worth the 12 dollars.
[0:01:59] <%d1stantutopia> Hey Woolie and Reggie, hyped for more DeS. Reggie's adorable joy at the end of last session was infectious! Can't wait to see it turn to despair once he reaches the Valley of Defilement.
[0:02:00] <%dreadedcthulhu> ... a fifth?
[0:02:13] <%ChoculaUltra> @twistedtapioca get it on fanatical dot com instead - it's $4.39

[0:02:46] <%CaptainPileDriver> reggie i hope you get scraping speared
[0:03:02] <cosmicgoatee> hey Woolie how about those 70+ New Star Wars Shows
[0:03:15] <%Lion_kun> Cry at how bad they were
[0:03:15] <andre11dr> I haven't even seen season one, so this seems like a good time to get on it
[0:03:25] <%BestTeaMaker> does reggie like westerns
[0:03:38] <%linSP> Star Wars is western
[0:03:41] <%dreadedcthulhu> bobba fett
[0:03:43] <VidulaSaix> Yeah if the first few aren't for you don't bother
[0:03:47] <%ChoculaUltra> there's something so good about the simplicity of Mandalorian
[0:03:52] <%Seancicle> what do I drop?
[0:03:59] <%twistedtapioca> @choculaultra Owww good looks üëÄ it‚Äôs just ridiculous I haven‚Äôt played it yet so I wanted the nudge
[0:04:03] <spamspaz> TV Shows are bad overall, skip all TV
[0:04:09] <cosmicgoatee> booba fett, a clone of boba fett is in fact canon LUL
[0:04:10] <VidulaSaix> wrong
[0:04:31] <%dreadedcthulhu> @cosmicgoatee BOOBA
[0:04:44] <@Menitta> I like it when things are good
[0:04:49] <spamspaz> Music > Movies > Games > > > TV
[0:04:55] <%ChoculaUltra> shows like the Wire and Breaking Bad and shit have set my tv standards a bit too high FeelsBadMan
[0:05:06] <+cvp5127> get ready for the 10 spin offs LUL
[0:05:17] <%jeanschyso> I used to care about Star Wars a lot but then they released Rise of Skywalker
[0:05:19] <+NordicHorseKing> Hello there
[0:05:23] <Solidnick18> clone wars is pretty good
[0:05:34] <cosmicgoatee> Genndy Grievous hits different
[0:05:34] <%ChoculaUltra> wouldn't mind a slice of life show about Watto selling junk. Don't judge me!
[0:05:35] <%CaptainPileDriver> fuck that movie
[0:05:38] <%CaptainPileDriver> the series is good
[0:05:43] <%jeanschyso> now I am completely indifferent to star wars, even the stuff I used to love
[0:05:44] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Gennedy Clone Wars was the SHIT
[0:05:54] <%cache_22> I saw that Clone Wars movie without seeing any of the cartoon yet. It was a mistake.
[0:06:00] <VidulaSaix> Gennady Grevious is dope
[0:06:08] <%Javaa01> Also, you get a lot more of parts of the series if you played Republic Commando
[0:06:09] <sleepy_pink> oh funny thing I just saw austin walker talking about genndy clone wars
[0:06:10] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1343849215710142464?s=19
[0:06:10] <%AlteisenReiseZ> That scene with the Stormtrooper drop in was some of the best
[0:06:13] <peachy996> I hear Gendy Grievous is actually there
[0:06:19] <%DashXero> Choo Chooo HypeHit
[0:06:20] <+DomunDomunDomun> Has Woolie played Fallen Order?
[0:06:23] <+CookieCutter007> villain of the week
[0:06:24] <peachy996> And not useless like in th movie
[0:06:33] <EternalJedi> peachy996 YES
[0:06:36] <+bearwagon> man that movie tho
[0:06:36] <%CaptainPileDriver> that movie is legit terrible
[0:06:36] <sleepy_pink> genndy's grievous is awesome
[0:06:39] <EternalJedi> GENDY GREIVOUS IS DOPE
[0:06:43] <Darren716> Oh god you saw that in theaters?
[0:06:43] <EternalJedi> super spooky
[0:06:45] <%CaptainPileDriver> IT'S A FUCKING BABYSITTING MOVIE
[0:06:45] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Asajj vs Anakin, Mace Windu against that Empire Barge, ALL OF GRIEVOUS
[0:06:47] <emeraldskrull> Reggie is the chosen one
[0:06:51] <Arweynn> gendy grievous is ACTUALLY A MENACING VILLAIN
[0:06:54] <spamspaz> My buddy dragged me to the theatre for that, was legit the worst thing I've paid to see
[0:06:58] <%Juriasu> justice for stinky
[0:06:58] <+cvp5127> the pilot movie LUL
[0:07:00] <cosmicgoatee> they made that grievous almost predator like
[0:07:00] <@Menitta> There are people who will destroy you if you shit on the clone wars show
[0:07:04] <EternalJedi> Mace Windu going DnD Monk on driuds, BAREFISTED
[0:07:08] <Jonny_Uppercut> Genndy Greivous is a monster, I love him
[0:07:14] <%twistedtapioca> @menitta It‚Äôs me, I‚Äôm people
[0:07:15] <%ChoculaUltra> Obi-Wan's Clone Wars look with the Clone armor and robe is a 10/10 design and I will die on this hill.
[0:07:16] <+eanscrale> That kid grows up and becomes a REAL character
[0:07:17] <Treuan> Now that annoying kid is the most loved character in the franchise lol
[0:07:19] <%robo_trunk> BABY HUT! STINKY HUT!
[0:07:24] <%jeanschyso> It was the first time I sighed during a movie at the theatre and I watched a lot of movies at the theatre
[0:07:31] <cosmicgoatee> Stinky Hut DansGame
[0:07:38] <andre11dr> Everything else that wasn't the movie's did Grievous great, he was such a wasted design in Revenge of the Sith
[0:07:40] <%Visorak6> climbing free of the omnishambles
[0:07:42] <CappuccinoGuil> WE IN
[0:07:43] <%Seancicle> brb afk üßèüèª‚ôÇÔ∏è
[0:07:43] <+CookieCutter007> skip part 1 LUL
[0:07:56] <EternalJedi> the 5 minute shorts are 10/10, the CGI show I've heard good things but haven't seen it yet
[0:08:02] <VidulaSaix> Age has nothing to do with it, it's just a personal taste thing
[0:08:13] <+ManOfReason> That‚Äôs me
[0:08:14] <%CaptainPileDriver> yes, it's why i can't stand reboot and beastwars
[0:08:22] <@Menitta> I'm not a huge fan of Clone Wars tbh
[0:08:27] <+eanscrale> She's the Anakin we always wanted
[0:08:28] <cosmicgoatee> @andre11dr it felt like an afterthought villian who would extend episode 3
[0:08:30] <@Solidus_113> I still don't care for Asokah
[0:09:03] <+CookieCutter007> One pace
[0:09:13] <VidulaSaix> See I dunno about that Woolie. There are so many things that start shit but become great
[0:09:23] <BubbaRands> The best thing about clone wars was Darth Maul characterization
[0:09:25] <%ChoculaUltra> can we get a Reno 911 type of show where Vader hunts down the rest of the Jedi between episodes 3 and 4?
[0:09:30] <cosmicgoatee> One Pace...literally skipping the recaps and intros cuts like 1/4 of the anime short LUL
[0:09:37] <+fetrigon> one pace is sooooo goooood
[0:09:41] <@Commando_Joe> @Solidus_113 even after the last season?
[0:09:42] <+Byronic_dreamer> catJAM
[0:09:47] <peachy996> Reno 911 Star Wars would be comedy gold
[0:09:48] <%Proxzo> I need a Clone Wars watching guide
[0:09:50] <@Solidus_113> ehh
[0:09:51] <Jonny_Uppercut> One Pace is a blessing
[0:09:52] <%jeanschyso> @ChoculaUltra I think there's a comicbook series about exactly that
[0:09:54] <peachy996> Told by Stormtroopers
[0:10:00] <%twistedtapioca> People are allowed not to like things it‚Äôs ridiculous to kill people for it. But all that maul content man...if you want more maul with depth that‚Äôs the move
[0:10:02] <Gutsandlove> ahsoka was neat
[0:10:07] <@Menitta> streamlabs wont let me donate I have a kirby question woolieDATTEBAYO
[0:10:08] <Prevot> one pace is not made for people who haven't already seen or read one piece
[0:10:21] <Solidnick18> maybe i'll watch it
[0:10:30] <JayEarly> Clone Wars Anakin rules and makes me more angry about the prequels in retrospect
[0:10:37] <cosmicgoatee> toei padding out Kappa
[0:10:51] <@akuda_bar> @Menitta i already did it
[0:10:53] <Dante_Namikaze1> it's not the bigger stuff it's only tying into the cartoon stuff
[0:10:57] <@Menitta> Oh good
[0:10:59] <+The_Butterfly_Man> its fine
[0:11:03] <@akuda_bar> do it anyway so we can sound like idiots
[0:11:05] <@Commando_Joe> Rogue One is good if it's isolated
[0:11:07] <%Juriasu> I kinda didn't like rogue one at first but it grew on me
[0:11:09] <+cvp5127> no only luke
[0:11:10] <JayEarly> Clone Wars anakin is the guy Obi Wan tells Luke about in episode iv
[0:11:10] <Kiryurules> Rogue One is great
[0:11:11] <+megaman_sentinel> no Jedi= good show lol
[0:11:11] <%enZymeth> Anakin the drama queen
[0:11:12] <BubbaRands> Rogue one was fine to me
[0:11:14] <@Solidus_113> Did you clap when you saw THE THINGS?
[0:11:14] <VidulaSaix> Rogue One has some cool moments but overall I didn't care for it
[0:11:17] <cosmicgoatee> i will say they've been on point for digimon and op recently tho, if not for the good animation bits
[0:11:17] <@Menitta> I like Solo
[0:11:18] <peachy996> Solo sucked
[0:11:19] <%kyh9> I LIKE SOLO
[0:11:19] <%khalcipher> rogue one its great
[0:11:20] <Darren716> Solo is fine
[0:11:21] <Dante_Namikaze1> Solo sucks outside of Lando
[0:11:24] <emeraldskrull> Solo is the best disney wars movie
[0:11:25] <%BisoromiBear> Duo
[0:11:25] <%Juriasu> Solo is okayyyy
[0:11:26] <%JustYudha> I enjoyed it
[0:11:26] <%kyh9> Solo was good, it was pretty enjoyable
[0:11:26] <Arweynn> rogue one suffered alot from MGS5-itis
[0:11:27] <%Visorak6> Solo is fine???
[0:11:28] <%Proxzo> Solo has 1 good thing
[0:11:28] <@Commando_Joe> Solo is a fun heist movie but a bad Star Wars movie
[0:11:29] <peachy996> I watched it and DIDN'T like Solo
[0:11:29] <%d1stantutopia> I really like Rogue One, I really didn't like Solo
[0:11:30] <DSD24> Ben Swolo?
[0:11:34] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Rogue One was good but RLM ruined it LUL
[0:11:35] <%CaptainPileDriver> rogue one is great i you like bad writing and characters with no characters
[0:11:37] <%Terrarp> Solo had Maul for a few seconds, that's it
[0:11:38] <%JustYudha> Just a fun popcorn movie imo
[0:11:40] <%kyh9> Solo was better than TLJ and Rise of Skywalker for me. Better than Rogue One too tbh
[0:11:42] <prime_name> I wish Rouge One was a series and not a movie.
[0:11:44] <AngryAsian5> I liked Solo. IMO it was WAY better than any of the sequel movies LUL
[0:11:44] <%jeanschyso> basically whenever you don't have skywalkers in the movie, it's a fun movie. I also liked Solo very much
[0:11:44] <ColbyBryant> Solo was ok
[0:11:45] <Dante_Namikaze1> only good part of solo was Lando
[0:11:50] <jman13131313> I like solo
[0:11:52] <@Solidus_113> I literally turned off Solo 2/3rds of the way though, it's way too long
[0:11:53] <+Monolith_x> and chewy
[0:11:53] <%DashXero> The best part of Rogue One is the absence of Space Wizards.
[0:11:55] <$BallerSwagBro9k> AT STSs AT STs
[0:11:57] <%p4ntless> Solo isn't the worst but your time is better spent elsewhere
[0:12:00] <+DomunDomunDomun> Most people just didn't bother with Solo because TLJ was so bad.
[0:12:00] <spamspaz> Rogue One had way too many characters
[0:12:02] <+bearwagon> LUL
[0:12:02] <cosmicgoatee> Rogue One Shot
[0:12:03] <+cvp5127> sin
[0:12:04] <SivSarcast> I liked Rogue One. Jyn Erso > Rei any day

[0:12:11] <%Terrarp> Solo had Crime Boss Darth Maul
[0:12:11] <@Menitta> YEAH SUPER NOAH'S ARK 3D
[0:12:13] <%CptnCampy61> Rogue one was only good movie to come from sequels
[0:12:16] <%kyh9> Force Awakens > Solo > TLJ > Rogue One > > > > > Rise of Skywalker
[0:12:21] <+jiggy_snipe> the true day, get it right
[0:12:22] <+fetrigon> LUL
[0:12:22] <%khalcipher> @sivsarcast agreed
[0:12:26] <JayEarly> There‚Äôs one scene Solo that looks like the 40k movie of my fucking dreams
[0:12:29] <%JustYudha> The video just uploaded on WoolieVS on that lol

[0:19:35] <Goraka91> Drop your shield Reggie
[0:19:38] <%RadicalEssay> I hope that Reggie gets a taste for invading other people by the end of this :D
[0:19:44] <%jackelzxaa> One thing Reggie was bad about was using R2 button for stronger, slower attacks. Reggie should keep in mind how different his R1 and R2 attacks are and how the Two Handed movesets differ for when he gets better at the game from there.

[0:32:34] <CappuccinoGuil> Forget Miracle, tho. You'd need 3 points in faith, that's too much
[0:32:38] <derap41> Its not all magic missiles

[0:33:29] <CappuccinoGuil> @Jack8274 isn't second chance a spell, not a miracle?
[0:33:34] <JayEarly> @pi_in_the_sci even in bloodborne?
[0:33:40] <ToastyBroDude> Loser

[0:43:09] <Equirah> go grab the souls
[0:43:11] <+paladinstarbuster> Theog demon souls LP was ruined by dudes dropping stuff
[0:43:11] <whirly25> Believe it!
[0:43:13] <%d1stantutopia> I do want Reggie to have fun
[0:43:13] <%CaptainPileDriver> no fun allowed
[0:43:16] <+jiggy_snipe> you know, it's one thing if they weren't live streaming
[0:43:21] <%d1stantutopia> But I also wanna see him get SCRAPED
[0:43:21] <VidulaSaix> I mean to be frank Woolie, you're already robbing him of the experience of PVP LUL
[0:43:24] <brunoberserk> '' reggie casts himself from the highest stairs of nexus ... ''
[0:43:28] <CurrySauseBandit> I mean, the point is to find out through trial and error. But alright.
[0:43:28] <bradley1990> you robbed him of the true demon souls experience
[0:43:30] <%Seancicle> Sean Hill: Straight to DVD
[0:43:35] <ToastyBroDude> Couldnt he just play offline
[0:43:36] <@Solidus_113> "ruin the LP"
[0:43:37] <%CaptainPileDriver> if i could scraping spear him i would
[0:43:37] <@Menitta> hahaha yeah
[0:43:38] <$Rumbutt> Gotta do the world tendies
[0:43:39] <derap41> What's the worst that could happened
[0:43:40] <VidulaSaix> What would it ruin? He would just die cmon now
[0:43:40] <Louie_Salmon> Reggie can have some fun PVP later if he wants.
[0:43:43] <%Jack8274> Not everyone picks up weapons like you dude, don't project
[0:43:43] <+RaveBV> But Reggie is losing the whole trial and error experience
[0:43:44] <+Grayhammatter> the claw!
[0:43:45] <+zzNamttamzz> maybe the invader would have been nice LUL
[0:43:48] <+Kindan55> world tendency is a garbage system
[0:43:48] <%ChoculaUltra> claw grip!
[0:43:53] <%segmentedfool> THE CLAW
[0:43:53] <VidulaSaix> Its not like he can see everything in one playthrough anyway
[0:43:53] <MyNameIsRasus> I DO THAT
[0:43:53] <%Visorak6> camera control is everything
[0:43:54] <resloxxx> The claw
[0:43:55] <Blank9> PRO REGGIE
[0:43:55] <+yukichocomilk> claw is the truth
[0:43:58] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> I do that too
[0:43:58] <derap41> The Claw
[0:43:58] <VidulaSaix> So I dont get the logic
[0:44:02] <%segmentedfool> Best way to play every game
[0:44:05] <%zanderwitch42> claw is best
[0:44:05] <+Ultimate_Edge> He'll fight an invasion sooner or later :)
[0:44:07] <+lil_pudintater9> THIS GUY GETS IT
[0:44:09] <+The_Butterfly_Man> the claw is the most optimal way to play
[0:44:09] <thetrashman_sc> the claw is bad
[0:44:10] <MyNameIsRasus> REGGIE IS CORRECT
[0:44:11] <+SarcFa> Universe acting like there wouldn't be a scraping spear mf, or a guy that drops late game shit
[0:44:13] <DeathByPoke7> I think enb does that
[0:44:15] <%segmentedfool> Reggie gets it
[0:44:18] <@Solidus_113> Reggie knows
[0:44:18] <+thefancywig> yeah i totally do that too
[0:44:18] <Porpino_> claw supremacy
[0:44:19] <%badfleshboy> Claw style
[0:44:20] <user_naim> True souls player already
[0:44:21] <Tampaoster> teach the claw
[0:44:21] <%robobeau> Reggie ORGANICALLY discovered the claw
[0:44:21] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Reggie is already at advanced starts
[0:44:21] <@akuda_bar> i also dont sprint in these games lol
[0:44:23] <%Aztec50> The student teaches the master
[0:44:23] <%CaptainPileDriver> invasions wouldn't ruin the lp but i guess
[0:44:24] <+Ultimate_Edge> Claw is the correct way
[0:44:27] <+blastyoboots> Can you set your controls to sprint while clicking in the left stick?
[0:44:28] <user_naim> That‚Äôs how it is
[0:44:28] <Equirah> you kinda shouldn't be sprinting most of the time Reggie
[0:44:28] <ElPlasa> THE CLAW
[0:44:29] <%d1stantutopia> The point of the Souls control scheme is to limit simultaneous actions
[0:44:29] <Blank9> Reggie's doing great
[0:44:29] <Solidnick18> LUL
[0:44:32] <brunoberserk> FEAR THE CLAW
[0:44:34] <+yukichocomilk> i always claw while moving around
[0:44:34] <%hax_metatron> ENB SCHEME PogChamp
[0:44:35] <Johannen> Did the tune down the autocenter on the camera?
[0:44:35] <haydenfoxy> i always do that too
[0:44:35] <%jeanschyso> I use the left hand to control both sticks when I'm just running
[0:44:36] <elshadow7> Not very familiar with Demon Souls, I understand invasions might have some negative effects, but ruining the lp? Is it really that bad? Honest question.
[0:44:37] <MyNameIsRasus> Claw is the Lord's Path
[0:44:38] <%BisoromiBear> Reggie's tech is on point
[0:44:39] <buster7800> claw is ULTIMATE style
[0:44:40] <andre11dr> It's not actually that bad, you can turn areas to pure black and still reach pure white bye the end, however you NEED to kill the Primeval Demons to get it @woolieversus
[0:44:42] <Tampaoster> Teach him the claw its the easiest
[0:44:42] <Solidnick18> i guess that's one way of doing
[0:44:43] <%Jack8274> Rebind O to X, that helps too
[0:44:43] <+paladinstarbuster> this is the way
[0:44:44] <%segmentedfool> Everyone eventually develops their own claw
[0:44:46] <user_naim> Nah that‚Äôs the tech
[0:44:47] <ToastyBroDude> i always hold run with my index finger
[0:44:50] <user_naim> Reggie is a natural
[0:44:51] <%wydamn> This is actually the reason why I like gyro controls for souls games
[0:44:52] <MyNameIsRasus> LUL
[0:44:56] <%cobalt_phoenix_> map LUL
[0:44:57] <%d1stantutopia> Map LIL
[0:44:57] <Solidnick18> just the mental map
[0:44:58] <%ChoculaUltra> "Where's the map?!"
[0:45:03] <%d1stantutopia> Map LUL
[0:45:04] <%hax_metatron> Reggie using the proest of pro strats. ENB uses this! Woolie left in the dirt by these mechanics. LUL
[0:45:05] <%jackelzxaa> hoping woolie doesn't ruin the surprises on an npc or so with TOO MUCH guidance (Some are best when you don't know alot)
[0:45:10] <derap41> That's How ENB Does that's how america does it And I'll be god damned if anything gonna change that
[0:45:17] <%thesickestzak> Could just let the invasion stuff happen now where it's still early. But nah, just bug cowardice
[0:45:19] <bradley1990> nofunallowed high school geography teacher woolie is in full gear grrrr
[0:45:24] <brunoberserk> map ?? haha , that's cute LUL

[0:45:45] <+jiggy_snipe> @elshadow7 someone probably wants to destroy his gear or drop items
[0:45:46] <+SarcFa> @elshadow7 scraping spear is a weapon invaders can use to break all of reggie's gear, which would cost a lot to repair, also the issue with invaders possibly dropping late game stuff, like happened in Woolie's og Demons run
[0:45:48] <DSD24> There's no map

[0:48:33] <derap41> Thank you Spy
[0:48:41] <+Kindan55> based spy
[0:48:41] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:48:42] <@Solidus_113> you're looking for weapons that have a kick
[0:48:52] <+Jayleedurr> hasBuff hasBuff hasBuff hasBuff hasBuff hasBuff hasBuff hasBuff
[0:48:53] <derap41> Its not a kick its a jump back attack
[0:49:00] <MyNameIsRasus> A kick is a guardbreaker
[0:49:00] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Reggie, parrying is fancy and all that but blocking is your meat and potatoes for the early game
[0:49:00] <bradley1990> spy may as well call in, since woolies gonna backseat anyway, may as well backseat more accurately
[0:49:07] <+paladinstarbuster> Not better different
[0:49:17] <Ookamiden02> oh, spy is here
[0:49:24] <%A_German_spy> @bradley1990 Nah, I'm just here to enjoy the mayhem. Woolie's got this.
[0:49:26] <ruggles322> Have we eaten a Demons Soul yet?
[0:49:41] <brunoberserk> reggie : I LEARNING !!
[0:49:44] <%jeanschyso> I love the fire swords on those guys, they just look neat
[0:49:52] <MyNameIsRasus> As much as Spy calling in would be cool, Woolie's done a pretty good job at guiding
[0:49:54] <+Kindan55> Does the ground count as a demon soul?
[0:50:02] <%ChoculaUltra> mooooo
[0:50:07] <andre11dr> It's kinda funny how the bare fist has a better attack than most weapons in this game LUL
[0:50:10] <Equirah> Cow-ard Kappa
[0:50:12] <+vaderxyz1970> Moooooo bitch
[0:50:17] <LunarRemix> I don't know about Demon's but in Dark Souls parry starts at 1 Frame from pressing the button
[0:50:21] <%jackelzxaa> reggie should try out the R2 combo
[0:50:24] <%twistedtapioca> @ @andre11dr specially that parry üëÄ
[0:50:26] <+paladinstarbuster> the spear and shield combo is always good
[0:50:43] <VidulaSaix> The trades
[0:51:01] <+stella_potato> is this his first souls game experience?
[0:51:07] <%skeletonman9000> the parry is if you were trying to parry the wrist

[0:51:18] <%jackelzxaa> because of how wide this sword's R1 swing is, R2 is better when near walls because i believe it's an overhead.

[0:54:39] <sleepy_pink> it is a good spear, the damage numbers aren't showing the actual scaling here because reggie doesn't meet stat reqs

[0:55:02] <MyNameIsRasus> 13 is a lucky number
[0:55:14] <+Mkingston> I've not played either Demon's Souls and I don't want to spoil too much of it for myself. I like the 3D model view of the weapon. I managed to finished DS1&3 thanks to SBFP this year.
[0:55:22] <+zzNamttamzz> counter damage for big numbers too
[0:55:26] <BimboBagging> nothing bad has ever happened on the 13th of a month
[0:55:42] <andre11dr> 13 would be useful if he knew about Blue Blood but he probably won't level luck up

[0:59:59] <redrins> does he have a catalyst?
[1:00:00] <pi_in_the_sci> You need more equipment before you can magic
[1:00:01] <%Visorak6> I mean you have enough to get two levels p sure
[1:00:02] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Spears are fun, smaller greatswords and curved swords are also up there for my favorites
[1:00:02] <+Mkingston> @Jack8274 I remember. I got the game on launch. Got very far relying on my Lightning Spear. Then they nerfed it from 11 uses to 3. I never went back to that game.
[1:00:04] <%d1stantutopia> You have enough items to do both though
[1:00:07] <+paladinstarbuster> Why didnt he pick royalty then?
[1:00:08] <+Kindan55> Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[1:00:11] <%jackelzxaa> reggie could do spear and magic if he popped that lead demon's soul

[1:24:30] <CappuccinoGuil> I think Reggie was doing better with the Falchion LUL
[1:24:34] <$BallerSwagBro9k> THAT GUY IS GETTING PROMOTED
[1:24:34] <OBKWorld> Have everyone made the drop your shield and perfect meme yet?
[1:24:45] <Graxe_> The main weakness of spears and other poking weapons is that they are extremely negative on block
[1:24:45] <user_naim> Not PvE, it‚Äôs EvP
[1:24:45] <MyNameIsRasus> yes
[1:24:48] <%d1stantutopia> @OBKWorld nonstop last session
[1:24:49] <%Jack8274> If you play Street Fighter, and you keep getting countered, you need to learn the tech as to why you get countered.
[1:24:52] <Graxe_> And are easily parried
[1:24:55] <Firststrike_OW> Many, many times LUL
[1:25:05] <derap41> I mean talking about counter damage % and stuff Reggie is still on the "look around" stage
[1:25:28] <+chiazam> He really needs to just bait it out
[1:25:33] <%Jack8274> @user_naim This doesn't apply in PVP lol. That has different % for counters
[1:25:41] <OBKWorld> Ah okay. I understand. Though has Woolie turned into pat completely?
[1:25:45] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[1:25:46] <+BrachyZoid> You can do it, Reggie! lunarHype
[1:25:47] <+Romuken> EZ
[1:25:54] <Graxe_> Woolie's letting Reggie do his thing, mainly
[1:25:55] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL LUL
[1:25:57] <+cvp5127> its safe here
[1:25:57] <%Jack8274> @OBKWorld Yep lol
[1:26:04] <user_naim> @jack8274 oh i was just jokinh about the enemies being protagonists
[1:26:05] <CappuccinoGuil> Why does Reggie walk while moving the camera?
[1:26:20] <andre11dr> 1-2 is an interesting level, in that it's basically just a line
[1:26:21] <Tempmael> gotta listen for the cues
[1:26:29] <%Jack8274> @user_naim Oh sorry. Umbasa

[1:27:19] <+patriotrenegade> Reggie pls
[1:27:45] <derap41> Can't poke a shield away
[1:27:48] <+Checktrap> just go back to swords man
[1:27:55] <CappuccinoGuil> The spear is a VERY different weapon to the falchion, Reggie
[1:27:56] <%Jack8274> You can't parry on steep angles, it's based off the arm more than the weapon.
[1:27:58] <OBKWorld> So is Reggie going the DS1 Woolington strat?
[1:28:06] <Pookiedaexzile> at least two hand it if you arent gonna block
[1:28:10] <andre11dr> @necnill Because Souls = sanity in this world, and these guys got their souls stolen by demons
[1:28:22] <elshadow7> Man that dragon looks cool.
[1:28:23] <+Necnill> @andre11dr Ohhhhhh
[1:28:30] <user_naim> Throw both spears in the trash where they belong. Not really, but almost
[1:28:31] <+chiazam> I don't think Reggie was meant for the Way of the Spear
[1:28:51] <derap41> @andre11dr Well no souls = no sanity buy souls =! sanity
[1:28:59] <%Jack8274> @Pookiedaexzile You need to get used to that lol. it's going to be a hot minute
[1:29:08] <$BallerSwagBro9k> DOVAKIN DOVAKIN
[1:29:13] <siamzero94> I doubt Reggie will be the next Zhao Yun

[1:31:10] <+chiazam> THE ARCHER CLASS
[1:31:16] <%Cultist_Ryua> Spear only works if he actually raises his shield.

[1:31:33] <OBKWorld> So we have never stop blocking Woolie and never block ever Reggie? What a combo?
[1:31:46] <user_naim> Reggie Nine Shots over here
[1:31:50] <Darren716> Pick up your shield!
[1:31:52] <+EscoSul> good move, blocking all the arrows with your back

[1:35:29] <andre11dr> Or you can flip with Havels on ,fucking unpatched DS1 was wild
[1:35:31] <%Javaa01> But that also requires you to actually, ya know, block
[1:35:31] <%Cultist_Ryua> Fat roll is for people who raise their shields.
[1:35:32] <elshadow7> Without fat rolling that is
[1:35:32] <brunoberserk> try changing the gauntlet and legs

[1:46:36] <derap41> Helmet is a good idea having some armor instead of none makes a big diffirence
[1:46:39] <pognotgop> Never buy weapons
[1:46:48] <%emperordread> Yo, I miss anyhing?
[1:47:30] <elshadow7> Is the parry window smaller with L-handed weapons? I could never get it to work as consistently as shields.

[2:09:55] <$Invlux> did he parry a firebomb
[2:09:56] <therealtacopancakes> parry a molotov
[2:09:59] <Afrikus310> Watch him backstab again
[2:10:04] <%Cultist_Ryua> I feel like woolie is going to sit down at the end of the chat and talk about this shield business.
[2:10:06] <brachydios777> Is this technically a Drake?
[2:10:19] <%BisoromiBear> wait for your turn and punish

[2:13:44] <Johannen> Reggie you have to aknoweldge the existence of shields, yours and enemies
[2:13:45] <iamnuff> He's been practicing his backstab on his friend too
[2:13:52] <+Dannzzyy> Also don‚Äôt forget you can two hand your weapon.
[2:13:54] <iamnuff> So you know he's good at it by now.
[2:13:56] <justlikehumans> holy shit, he used his sheild
[2:14:04] <MyNameIsRasus> I can see that Reggie will become super good at this game eventually
[2:14:05] <ManlyMcBeefington> chat any progress?
[2:14:09] <%Cultist_Ryua> Thank you woolie.
[2:14:15] <iamnuff> Woolie, does Reggie know that he can block arrows with his shield?
[2:14:20] <MyNameIsRasus> You can also just block instead of parrying
[2:14:26] <%robo_trunk> PLOUGH HIM REGGIE
[2:14:29] <%d1stantutopia> dw guys, Reggie has been practicing his backstabs with his good friend Ostrava

[2:15:01] <Pookiedaexzile> VoteYea
[2:15:01] <%Cultist_Ryua> He tries to plow through shields. He doesn't block. This is how you do it
[2:15:05] <VidulaSaix> LUL
[2:15:06] <%rcand9> shields are for people who dont like attacking
[2:15:13] <iamnuff> 2Hand is kind of an advanced technique. It feels like woolie should just be telling him to block more. Then again, Reggie has a bad shield.

[2:15:40] <%Cultist_Ryua> Yeah, two hand is meant to be more advanced but it makes too much sense for him.
[2:15:41] <Graxe_> Are there headshots in Demon's? I thought that was Dark Souls onward
[2:15:41] <%Livelinne> in da head
[2:15:42] <%Amaideus> The lesson there is that R2 while twohanded will oneshot them

[2:15:53] <Solidnick18> he's learning PogChamp
[2:16:01] <%allups> intro*
[2:16:02] <Pookiedaexzile> The Wandering Dancer
[2:16:03] <%Visorak6> I feel like reggie definitely will prefer stamina to hp
[2:16:09] <%Indigo_Automaton> The bosses are going to be so impressed when they see you, trust
[2:16:10] <+BloodyBurney> too many times, he says
[2:16:13] <andre11dr> "who needs a shield when you can roll like a bauss" said man that died
[2:16:21] <%Cultist_Ryua> Ideally he should be using his shield, but since he doesn't then yes. I think he will like katanas.
[2:16:34] <%X2Eliah> hmmmmmm
[2:16:39] <%d1stantutopia> P E R F E C T
[2:16:43] <$Invlux> i mean it very much is a creature
[2:16:44] <siamzero94> !OUT OF GRASS! except black moon
[2:16:46] <%Visorak6> OUT OF HEALS
[2:16:46] <iamnuff> Personally, I like to block so the enemy's attack bounces off it, then I can counter-attack.
[2:16:47] <Graxe_> Yeah, two-handing a katana
[2:16:49] <Pookiedaexzile> YAS KING
[2:16:56] <%Cultist_Ryua> Reggie things to like rolling, two handing, and dex. That's a katana.
[2:16:57] <%rcand9> 0 grass
[2:16:58] <iamnuff> 2-hand is very do-or-die.
[2:17:05] <jorniev> i kinda wish it was more than a stage hazzard
[2:17:05] <Johannen> No healing run begins now
[2:17:05] <MyNameIsRasus> REGGIE AND A KATANA WILL BE GOOD
[2:17:06] <Crashfan01> Grass at risk
[2:17:06] <CappuccinoGuil> If you're gonna purely 2H, swap the shield for some more armor?
[2:17:10] <%X2Eliah> Reggie is good at that -or-die thing
[2:17:11] <%emperordread> Any herbs left? Think hes tapped
[2:17:14] <%d1stantutopia> Does Reggarth have any grass left except Dark Moon?
[2:17:19] <+SarcFa> no big grass, still has crescent
[2:17:21] <%p4ntless> two-handing is a no cowardice zone
[2:17:23] <+Flatopia> Can he make it!?
[2:17:25] <siamzero94> ok phew he still have some

[2:18:09] <jorniev> HOOOOW
[2:18:14] <iamnuff> You can see when the crossbowmen are reloading. If you've got time, wait for them to shoot then go for them when they can't fight back
[2:18:20] <MyNameIsRasus> You also gotta TOP OFF
[2:18:29] <CappuccinoGuil> Wait, what about Ostrava?
[2:18:30] <Pookiedaexzile> eat more grass
[2:18:31] <Graxe_> Arrows and bolts are where a shield comes in handy, unless you can roll through all the shots
[2:18:37] <+ja07sj> HEAL
[2:18:39] <%Cultist_Ryua> Ostrava will be fine.
[2:18:43] <%rcand9> buy some grass
[2:18:43] <VidulaSaix> This is gonna get bad if he runs outta grass lol
[2:18:48] <user_naim> Firing squads, always a problem
[2:18:51] <iamnuff> Not sure if reggie even knows that he can block arrows. Never seen him do it.

[2:20:10] <%X2Eliah> Reggie is super not in control of his actions
[2:20:17] <%linSP> Never give up!
[2:20:19] <dastmwolf> gotta get those back stab down boys
[2:20:21] <OblivionSword1> might want to train reggie to use his shield more to block more
[2:20:26] <$SilverRoddo> Open your mind
[2:20:26] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:20:28] <MyNameIsRasus> Maybe stop relying on consumables
[2:20:32] <user_naim> Force him to attempt blocking
[2:20:34] <+jiggy_snipe> just rely on your blade
[2:20:35] <+cvp5127> drop your items
[2:20:36] <Pookiedaexzile> speed is King
[2:20:36] <%Cultist_Ryua> Fundamentals are better than buffs.
[2:20:37] <%jeanschyso> consider that you still kill them in the same number of hits
[2:20:37] <%d1stantutopia> It's not a general-use consumable, it's for specific situations and this ain't it
[2:20:45] <%allups> some enemies are just weaker to fire that's when it matters
[2:20:52] <Pookiedaexzile> Roll and maintain distance
[2:20:57] <iamnuff> Can Reggie parry the blue-boys?
[2:20:59] <Johannen> I second @OblivionSword1 and probably most of the chat, REGGIE USE THE SHIELD as intented to block
[2:21:01] <MyNameIsRasus> Yeah @jeanschyso is right, it still takes the same amount of hits
[2:21:02] <Pookiedaexzile> Footises are the best defense
[2:21:08] <andre11dr> Buffs are for when you are confident, which you are not
[2:21:14] <Ralyks9117> woolieSHOOK
[2:21:17] <%Cultist_Ryua> He controls very well for someone running so fast, but maybe slow down.
[2:21:23] <Graxe_> Oh hey, he locked on to the dragon
[2:21:30] <Graxe_> Almost like you could kill it
[2:21:30] <andre11dr> Not now, hes almost done
[2:21:30] <%X2Eliah> hack slash hack slash
[2:21:36] <Pookiedaexzile> Not getting Hit is the best defensive option wait for them to fuck up
[2:21:41] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[2:21:47] <Josef_Stryker> No shame in eating shit when it's your first time
[2:21:47] <+jiggy_snipe> Reggie is doing ok rolling. He just needs to pick the right moments to heal
[2:21:48] <VidulaSaix> No but just Git Gud tho

[2:21:50] <%emperordread> We believe in you Reggie woolieKICKDAD
[2:21:53] <%dudedude55555> Self-Salting Reggie
[2:21:55] <Crashfan01> First time is always hard
[2:21:58] <MyNameIsRasus> YOU'RE GETTING BETTER
[2:22:02] <%d1stantutopia> Let it be known that for a first time souls player, Reggie is doing a phenomenal job
[2:22:04] <+BloodyBurney> don't like to backseat, but its tough watching him play on hardmode from the very beginning
[2:22:05] <LVL1_Scumbag> It's the same fuck ups a lot of people have made
[2:22:09] <user_naim> Oh no this is great content
[2:22:11] <%robobeau> If Reggie's got any Soul items, maybe buy a couple levels to even the odds?
[2:22:11] <ChungusQuest> lots of items at end of dragonfire track
[2:22:13] <+MikeNmurdoc> this game wrecked us all once upon a time
[2:22:18] <oneimportantthing> Pat would be bullying Reggie so hard now, glad it's Woolie instead
[2:22:22] <LVL1_Scumbag> Through fuckups come mastery
[2:22:23] <%Cultist_Ryua> Yes.
[2:22:25] <%Visorak6> correct
[2:22:28] <VidulaSaix> Either way is viable

[2:22:44] <%p4ntless> reggie's gonna come out of this so fucking strong
[2:22:45] <%BisoromiBear> dammit reggie, why don't you have all of the tech i've internalized over 4k hours of souls series gameplay?
[2:22:49] <+jiggy_snipe> he has time to pick up those items
[2:22:50] <%rcand9> dont worry about it reggie everyone has a point where they struggle on there first souls game
[2:22:51] <+jiggy_snipe> yea
[2:22:52] <iamnuff> Not sure about DS, but DS1 shield often spends less stamina than dodging.

[2:23:25] <%d1stantutopia> I had a lot of trouble with this section when I first played it on the PS3, for a first Souls game this is no joke
[2:23:31] <elshadow7> Is stability a thing in DeS?
[2:23:34] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[2:23:37] <iamnuff> He was looking at that bomb. Lol
[2:23:40] <brachydios777> Estus is so much better as a mechanic
[2:23:40] <+jiggy_snipe> utility belt man Kappa
[2:23:49] <Johannen> Reggie is trading damage in a system with limited healing
[2:23:49] <%p4ntless> can we replace reggie's belt with a pair of suspenders
[2:23:52] <MyNameIsRasus> Yeah Reg is learning super fast for a first timer
[2:23:52] <Josef_Stryker> Ostrava isn't dead is he?
[2:23:55] <iamnuff> No, but using the bombs as a tool to deal with tough enemies is totally valid. Woolie's just a purist.
[2:24:01] <user_naim> The wrong side of Batman
[2:24:10] <jorniev> if you want that stuff kill the dragon first
[2:24:10] <LunarRemix> Yeah the grass system isn't very good

[2:24:57] <bradley1990> we still here? dafuq
[2:25:02] <justlikehumans> hes getting real close
[2:25:03] <Josef_Stryker> Only to make Reggie more shook
[2:25:07] <%p4ntless> sometimes the download takes a while
[2:25:10] <Pookiedaexzile> ENEMIES are most vulnerable when they have just attacked, Dodge and counter

[2:25:15] <bradley1990> go to a different world
[2:25:17] <%Cultist_Ryua> He's streamlining his run.
[2:25:18] <Johannen> Shield main purpose is to block not to parry
[2:25:23] <%X2Eliah> The thing is, Reggie needs to learn how to deal with opponents like that
[2:25:26] <iamnuff> How fast do knives throw? Could he pick off the last arhcer while strafing away from the blueboy?
[2:25:34] <elshadow7> You could just bomb the frontline archers to avoid agroing the blue dude as well
[2:25:37] <%dreadedcthulhu> woolie just explained why they aren't going to a different area yall lmao
[2:25:41] <%d1stantutopia> these rolls mang

[2:25:50] <+jiggy_snipe> never back down Reggie
[2:26:02] <%X2Eliah> never, back down Reggie
[2:26:11] <%Cultist_Ryua> If he's not going to use the shield, take it off. Get more armor.

[2:42:53] <+fetrigon> it was a good run o7
[2:42:54] <sendart> reggie might as well not even equip a shield lol
[2:42:55] <xeros720> it really is
[2:42:57] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> That one seemed like a good dodge though
[2:43:01] <LunarRemix> He has full heals if he wants to use them

[2:43:34] <MKII> is it a souls thing for people to think their shield is worthless so you have to dodge everything
[2:43:41] <+CreggaMonsta> stay behind him
[2:43:45] <%dudedude55555> inhale the fragrance of the feet, reggie

[2:46:56] <Pookiedaexzile> Two handing was your best shot
[2:46:57] <+fetrigon> minh LUL
[2:46:57] <%jackelzxaa> tower knight as a boss is harder than alot of other bosses that reggie can do right now. the other bosses reggie has access to are much easier than tower knight for where he's at
[2:47:06] <xeros720> ha, durability is back!
[2:47:09] <danknugglit> heals are never a waste of souls
[2:47:09] <%BisoromiBear> Minh... atpBigot
[2:47:11] <DedlokPM> @SoushinSen Uh huh woolieMIRIN
[2:47:16] <+jiggy_snipe> time for some farmboi hours
[2:47:22] <%jackelzxaa> reggie might do best to just go to another zone
[2:47:24] <%Lion_kun> Do another world
[2:47:37] <+twohitgood> @a_german_spy hey

[2:47:58] <%Cultist_Ryua> Aay.
[2:48:02] <$SilverRoddo> bitterDab bitterDab bitterDab
[2:48:04] <Zayasu> you could get grass by killing the 2 knights before the boss
[2:48:05] <dastmwolf> spy is here
[2:48:06] <%firmlygraspi1> firmlygraspi1 subscribed with Prime.
[2:48:09] <+It_sjustjoey> Hhhhhiiiiii sppppyyyyyyyyyy
[2:48:11] <danknugglit> Clap
[2:48:12] <%allups> Spy and Minh What up
[2:48:12] <Kghaleon> Should at least level a bit, or invest in Evacuate so you can teleport out without penalty whenever you want
[2:48:13] <%Lion_kun> He has no resources
[2:48:16] <CappuccinoGuil> They drop grass, though
[2:48:17] <%A_German_spy> charly23Hi
[2:48:17] <xeros720> free pine resin though
[2:48:18] <%Th3SmartAlec> Hype train for GermanSpy
[2:48:19] <%Tearonex> Spy!
[2:48:21] <%Sparkseid> you can absolutely do it
[2:48:22] <+jiggy_snipe> he couldn't foresee getting sat on LUL
[2:48:23] <%baronblank> don't think I've seen reggie use his shield since I came on like 20 minutes ago
[2:48:23] <%Livelinne> Minh! PrideRise
[2:48:27] <notsoy> the thing you really want would be items
[2:48:30] <+LordCasante> grind
[2:48:31] <andre11dr> Also the other zone are more savage than this one
[2:48:32] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:48:42] <%Grimlockfly> Party500
[2:48:42] <Pookiedaexzile> I suggest you two hand
[2:48:44] <%Grimlockfly> Grimlockfly's Cheer shared rewards to 10 others in Chat!
[2:48:45] <%Visorak6> Looting the fire bridges on suicide runs might be worth it
[2:48:46] <+Grim1952> Put on the ring and do a run of 1-1, it's easy
[2:48:47] <dastmwolf> evacuate wouldn't be the worst thing in the world for Reggie. but the investment is way to big
[2:48:52] <DeathByPoke7> put that 13 luck to work
[2:48:56] <+cvp5127> 4-1 helps
[2:49:01] <+LordCasante> woolie check his item ring
[2:49:10] <Josef_Stryker> Hey if u can at least provide good commentary I'm sure we can enjoy farming videos
[2:49:11] <%Grimlockfly> Phalanax buddies
[2:49:16] <Zayasu> @WoolieVersus the 2 knights drop a lot of grass
[2:49:18] <%Amaideus> Amaideus subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 1 month streak! I want muh emote
[2:49:18] <%A_German_spy> @dastmwolf Evacuate also costs 20,000 souls
[2:49:24] <+yukichocomilk> farming stream PogChamp
[2:49:24] <+LordCasante> show him 4-1
[2:49:26] <%Jack8274> Once you beat 4-1 , you have a great farming spot without spoiling anything
[2:49:31] <MKII> the run toward the boss may drop all the grass he needs
[2:49:32] <%jackelzxaa> the reason you'd go and do other zones is because you can level up or find better weapons in other parts of the world and then come back to tower knight stronger and not just bash his head against one boss. DeS is really friendly to letting him just make his way to all 5 available bosses and then slowly peck away at them until one falls.
[2:49:33] <+That_Marcus_Dude> @yukichocomilk Pog
[2:49:38] <+Grim1952> 2-1 is pretty easy too
[2:49:40] <+cvp5127> dont have to beat 4-1
[2:49:45] <+mMayrro> seems like for next stream we'll have a bit off grinding off-screen Kappa
[2:49:49] <%jeanschyso> eeeh the NPC is gonna be OK?
[2:49:51] <+LordCasante> the beginning of 4-1 is an easy to learn fun farming spot
[2:49:52] <%Amaideus> 2-1 will crush him
[2:49:56] <xeros720> i remember those mini phalanxes being good, rare chance of some kind of ore
[2:49:59] <Monkeyweed21> @jackelzxaa he was literally 1 hit from winning
[2:49:59] <%Amaideus> They have crazy slash defense
[2:50:00] <derap41> Just grind a lit of camera
[2:50:03] <%jackelzxaa> Reggie only got as far as he did using items
[2:50:03] <%allups> off-camera grinding love to hear it
[2:50:07] <%linSP> ‚ÄúSo I did some grinding off screen‚Äù
[2:50:12] <%d1stantutopia> Ah, the glorious return of "so I did some grinding off-camera"
[2:50:13] <%Jack8274> I mean 4-2 with a bow, for the 15K in 10 second farming run\
[2:50:16] <%jackelzxaa> it's better to just get stronger by doing easier zones
[2:50:18] <%X2Eliah> Big cheats incoming
[2:50:25] <%jackelzxaa> 1-2 is actually harder than everywhere else he can do now
[2:50:26] <Crashfan01> "SO I grinded a bit off-screen"
[2:50:26] <sendart> the dragon could get him some easy souls
[2:50:30] <%emperordread> Reggie wants that runback
[2:50:32] <%baka_sugoi> time for a bathroom break psaUp
[2:50:33] <dastmwolf> @a_german_spy the soul levels for faith 10, plus 20k, plus the God talisman I don't think he has yet. long way there if they chose to do so.
[2:50:37] <Torgue_1> And some in the game
[2:50:37] <%X2Eliah> Next session, Reggarth has 99999999999 grasses
[2:50:38] <%Parlux> "Go buy some grass" I can get behind that
[2:50:39] <Kghaleon> Once they reach 4-2, Woolie can grind him plenty of grass.
[2:50:42] <%Irridium> yeah hit up that dealer
[2:50:43] <%jackelzxaa> tower knight is as hard as many of the second world bosses
[2:50:45] <+Grayhammatter> nice try on that first one reggie
[2:50:50] <resloxxx> 2k souls gone PepeHands
[2:50:52] <%jackelzxaa> i don't mean stonefang i mean dash 2 bosses
[2:51:03] <%Parlux> Woolie-Git Gud
[2:51:04] <MikeyxStyles> "just go buy some grass" my life story
[2:51:04] <%allups> fucking bunkrupt
[2:51:17] <%Visorak6> can probably upgrade the falchion a little
[2:51:17] <%jackelzxaa> reggie can just go get souls elsewhere and become a caster and try with better resources later.
[2:51:21] <@SoushinSen> oh hey thanks for the gift sub. Franz
[2:51:22] <+That_Marcus_Dude> @MikeyxStyles me tomorrow :D
[2:51:25] <elshadow7> Would it be worth to upgrade the falchion to +2 at this point?
[2:51:30] <%allups> ima bout to go craft some grass
[2:51:33] <andre11dr> !uptime
[2:51:33] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 1 minute
[2:51:34] <%A_German_spy> @SoushinSen spyServed
[2:51:34] <%linSP> you‚Äôll lose ALL your souls
[2:51:57] <+Grim1952> The flachion won't be very good if they do 2-1
[2:52:05] <+yukichocomilk> blaze that grass
[2:52:06] <%Amaideus> +1 or +2 falchion would get kills in one fewer hits
[2:52:07] <+cvp5127> just kill the first guy at 4-1
[2:52:08] <%jackelzxaa> you'll find soul items in the other worlds so no matter what reggie can get much stronger by not focusing on beating the boss that he just lost to
[2:52:09] <%Amaideus> Which is really nice
[2:52:21] <%A_German_spy> @Grim1952 He has a Winged Spear that'll do well in 2-1
[2:52:22] <danknugglit> Its 420 somewhere
[2:52:24] <dastmwolf> @grim1952 aren't the miners weak to magic?
[2:52:31] <%Cultist_Ryua> Good idea on the lead soul.

[2:52:32] <%d1stantutopia> I would put LDS in storage mang
[2:52:33] <andre11dr> @grim1952 They have a spear tho
[2:52:36] <ezakur> The dude in the tunnel had better deals
[2:52:38] <+Grim1952> Winged spear is good
[2:52:41] <+Higure_yoru> those mining enemies weak to slashing or piercing?
[2:52:41] <+Grayhammatter> can also put some weapons in their as well
[2:52:43] <Pookiedaexzile> God please
[2:52:43] <%Parlux> lol
[2:52:44] <%allups> this is the punisment
[2:52:46] <dan_g_v> yeah better to spread across the worlds and see what they offer
[2:52:47] <Josef_Stryker> It's a painful lesson
[2:52:47] <%jackelzxaa> the game is designed for you to give up on a boss and come back later when you're much stronger, that's why you have access to the entire game at once.
[2:52:50] <%d1stantutopia> @Higure_yoru piercing
[2:52:51] <+LordCasante> woolie show him 4-1. it can help him GitGud and get rich fast
[2:52:52] <Josef_Stryker> But it's an important one
[2:52:55] <+RaveBV> trial and error is the waaay
[2:52:57] <glass_marcus> This is why estus is the bestus
[2:52:59] <%jackelzxaa> grinding is the Pat way to play.
[2:53:00] <%Parlux> Welcome to demon souls
[2:53:02] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Lead demon soul is only for making Scraping Spear, otherwise it gives you 1.5 souls
[2:53:03] <Pookiedaexzile> Just get rid of the shield
[2:53:07] <eldragon_1> Woolie LUL
[2:53:09] <ezakur> If reggie wants to try for better deals the dude in the tunnel had the good stuff
[2:53:10] <%Cultist_Ryua> He could also level up to get magic.
[2:53:11] <+Higure_yoru> thank you, i thought so the spear would be good
[2:53:11] <Darren716> The real demons's souls starts here
[2:53:13] <Crashfan01> all the homies prefer estus system
[2:53:22] <jorniev> the real demons souls!
[2:53:30] <dastmwolf> get the crescent falchion xD farm some levels on that first area too. that's what I used to do when I was stuck early game
[2:53:38] <+Grayhammatter> the real demons soul's starts now
[2:53:41] <%Parlux> I never played this, only dark souls 1 and I'm like HOLY SHIT NO FLASK?
[2:53:44] <%Cultist_Ryua> If reggie learns to use his shield between now and getting the scraping spear then it might work
[2:53:45] <eldragon_1> This is so mean LUL
[2:53:48] <%Indigo_Automaton> You don't have enough Faith
[2:53:59] <Pookiedaexzile> Before you go think about your Best run
[2:54:04] <%allups> the lords path, jesus hear we go again
[2:54:04] <%Visorak6> phalanx only drop shards
[2:54:07] <%Parlux> Choo Chooo HypeShield Lets go regie
[2:54:07] <+BloodyBurney> its time to get gud or get got
[2:54:11] <+That_Marcus_Dude> @Parlux in the original you could stack 99 of each grass, theres a reason its the easiest souls game by far xD
[2:54:12] <VidulaSaix> Time to learn Boss Runs
[2:54:12] <Pookiedaexzile> WHAT WAS YOUR BEST RUN REGGIE
[2:54:13] <justlikehumans> will he press triangle?
[2:54:15] <resloxxx> @Parlux Flask are better, in this one you can just stuck shitton of healing even in early game
[2:54:17] <+Grayhammatter> it's fine
[2:54:24] <resloxxx> stack*
[2:54:26] <%Indigo_Automaton> Unequip it
[2:54:28] <%jackelzxaa> he can find better armor and upgrade materiels in other zones, he can get spells, other weapons, level up....i don't think bashing your head against a boss is the natural thing to do to get good at the game. reggie might not learn the right lessons
[2:54:33] <andre11dr> The grass system ruined the PVP of this game, everyone had 99 Darkmoon grass and second chance
[2:54:36] <+Grayhammatter> run boy run
[2:54:44] <%X2Eliah> ~~~ S H O O K ~~~
[2:54:54] <+Grayhammatter> reggie is SHOOK
[2:54:55] <+jiggy_snipe> it's not bashing your head if you o only attempted the boss once
[2:54:59] <+jiggy_snipe> geez
[2:55:02] <%Cultist_Ryua> That's fair!
[2:55:03] <%firmlygraspi1> it 100% is
[2:55:05] <+That_Marcus_Dude> and did pretty well too
[2:55:06] <VidulaSaix> Chats just impatient they'll live\
[2:55:09] <$SilverRoddo> bitterShook bitterShook
[2:55:09] <%allups> does he even have to go up to this tower cant he just run across the brige
[2:55:13] <%d1stantutopia> Absolutely
[2:55:13] <+mMayrro> shut up chat let the man play the game
[2:55:13] <+fetrigon> he did well
[2:55:14] <dastmwolf> @jackelzxaa to be honest Reggie takes some time to get used to each area. trying to do a whole new area is gonna take another 4 hours.
[2:55:16] <+BloodyBurney> y'know what, fair
[2:55:16] <%X2Eliah> Yeah 1 time is not even close to bash
[2:55:19] <+Grim1952> But it'll be easier if you do other areas
[2:55:19] <+king_of_beggars> I agree with Woolie!
[2:55:19] <elshadow7> Yeah, he's got this
[2:55:22] <+It_sjustjoey> Shut up chat
[2:55:22] <%Amaideus> Grass is the worst healing system, then Blood Vials, then DS2 estus/lifestones, then DS3, then DS1
[2:55:22] <%firmlygraspi1> how is learning attack radius' not helpful, chat?
[2:55:23] <+Grayhammatter> absolutely fair
[2:55:25] <Johannen> Once attempt was after bashing the head and wasting resources on multiple RUNs
[2:55:26] <andre11dr> He should probably just run by everyone here
[2:55:27] <%BestTeaMaker> this is literally reggie's first souls game, calm down
[2:55:27] <+jiggy_snipe> also ffs he has learn a new area too
[2:55:29] <peachy996> He figured out most of the fight, he should get another chance on it
[2:55:32] <elshadow7> He'll probably die a few more times, but, that's the game.
[2:55:32] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1343849215710142464?s=19
[2:55:34] <%KShirahama> @jackelzxaa stop repeating yourself, they can do this the way they want
[2:55:34] <+fetrigon> for first at this game and in this series
[2:55:37] <%Cultist_Ryua> This boss will teach you that you HAVE to get behind people. It's a good lesson.
[2:55:37] <+Grayhammatter> DRAGON
[2:55:38] <%d1stantutopia> People are saying to go to other zones because they have no patience, and more importantly no faith in our boy woolieKICKDAD

[2:55:44] <%X2Eliah> DRINK THE BLUE STUFF
[2:55:45] <Pookiedaexzile> Reggie can do this, but he must embrace his skill set
[2:55:46] <+Dannzzyy> He did excellent for a new player
[2:55:47] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL LUL
[2:55:49] <VidulaSaix> LUL
[2:55:51] <+RaveBV> Was it worth it, son?
[2:55:52] <%krispen_wa> you... did it
[2:55:53] <jaygee303> It‚Äôs the run if he chooses to take every enemy on which he doesn‚Äôt really have to
[2:55:53] <%Visorak6> Shouldve looted it all
[2:56:00] <%firmlygraspi1> might as well grab the others now
[2:56:04] <MKII> if you're gonna pick up items run back to the closest safe spot
[2:56:04] <+fetrigon> stop doing that
[2:56:12] <%Parlux> When boss fell on reggie the guts theme started to play
[2:56:12] <+fetrigon> holy shit LUL

[3:03:22] <+fetrigon> @soushinsen good luck o7
[3:03:29] <%Cultist_Ryua> I don't think he should fight anything too tough for a bit. Just work on fundementals and character building.
[3:03:32] <dastmwolf> @that_marcus_dude I don't think so xD
[3:03:34] <%jackelzxaa> DS1 makes repeated boss runs easier because of the estus system. you always have a window of mistakes in the estus flask system. this area and boss are kind of tough. the benefit to spreading around is general character beef and gear.
[3:03:42] <+king_of_beggars> Reggie, I know you ain't reading, but you're doing great, brother! Just keep learning, we're rootin for ya!
[3:03:48] <@SoushinSen> @fetrigon ?
[3:03:57] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Any second level will be harder and require more resources/upgrades/levels so its fine to do any other level

[3:17:00] <%Javaa01> And even with those, as is the fate of most gimmick bosses, he is ultimately pretty trivial on repeat
[3:17:01] <OldManDeckardCain> reggie respects feet too much to do this tho
[3:17:03] <%dudedude55555> summon dan schneider to help
[3:17:22] <peachy996> The more you do this run the calmer you will be
[3:17:24] <+logoth_> Summon Fred Durst
[3:17:30] <%jackelzxaa> oh i just realised this game actually does kind of has an estus equivalent, it's just not obvious unless you think about what resource a character gets for free when they die.

[3:26:50] <Monkeyweed21> maybe a bathroom break
[3:26:54] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> You don't have to back off so far. Only when he does the big slam. Unlock your camera and watch out for that move, then it's easy.
[3:26:55] <%cobalt_phoenix_> DON'T BE

[3:27:47] <Zezinizzle> Dude ur doing way better than my first time fighting this mofo
[3:27:49] <+aartbastiaan> those people are wrong
[3:27:49] <+Grayhammatter> you can't ruin runs
[3:27:49] <eriksdrums> This ain't DS2
[3:27:52] <+spardanwarrior> You can always grind more souls
[3:27:52] <$SilverRoddo> We want it all, the dizzying highs, and the terrifying lows
[3:27:57] <%RadicalEssay> You can only ruin a PVP build run
[3:27:59] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> you can grind offscreen too Kappa
[3:28:02] <smyld> YOU DOING GREAT REGGIE

[3:28:06] <+Grayhammatter> DS2 is a different story
[3:28:10] <Louie_Salmon> The 13 luck is a little silly, but otherwise we're doing great.
[3:28:11] <+aartbastiaan> any logical build is viable
[3:28:12] <BlackermanZX> you wil get a BIG grind spot at one point
[3:28:15] <+jiggy_snipe> high on souls Kappa
[3:28:18] <+SleepStarr> Get a level off these hero souls homie
[3:28:19] <user_naim> Nah, you can always get more, and you‚Äôll learn to beat anything with a stick
[3:28:22] <andre11dr> The only way to ruin a run is to level luck only or magic only
[3:28:26] <eriksdrums> Dump all, Max Luck
[3:28:28] <%jeanschyso> PVP has a meta to stay at certain levels
[3:28:36] <Pookiedaexzile> he can level
[3:28:41] <MikeyxStyles> high on souls and grass
[3:28:46] <ChungusQuest> The ONLY way you can ruin a run here is to fight Nexus NPCs.
[3:28:54] <+Grim1952> Level up instead
[3:29:10] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus If Reggie can make it to the trader under the bridge reliably he buy buy grass there
[3:29:22] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[3:29:29] <+Grim1952> Vit or endurance i'd say

[3:29:44] <+LordCasante> Vit would help
[3:29:45] <samazam94> for real reggie chill what you are going through rn is completely typical for a firdt timer.
[3:29:47] <+Grim1952> The damage right now is not noticeable
[3:29:49] <%d1stantutopia> Endurance
[3:29:55] <pi_in_the_sci> end
[3:29:56] <%d1stantutopia> More stamina would do Reggie wonders
[3:30:01] <xeros720> and defense
[3:30:07] <%jackelzxaa> magic would let him kill blue knights easily and get alot of souls
[3:30:08] <BlackermanZX> you can never go wrong with more vit
[3:30:10] <%Indigo_Automaton> Wouldn't his spear do more damage against armor than the curved sword?
[3:30:22] <Monkeyweed21> vit or endurance
[3:30:22] <+Grim1952> Endurance would help for armor too
[3:30:23] <Johannen> Lose the shield if you are not using it, maybe can get those gloves back)
[3:30:26] <%jackelzxaa> but it depends on what they'd want to do i guess
[3:30:30] <+Grim1952> Don't underestimate damage reduction
[3:30:33] <Blank9> magic for a projectile would help
[3:30:39] <Clundy> 2H spear maybe?
[3:30:43] <$cureneckbeard> Put Luck up to 50.
[3:30:43] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:30:57] <+b_aleph> always a little bit

[3:51:52] <+eanscrale> The spice must flow
[3:51:56] <%Amaideus> Some NPCs won't talk to you if you're too dumb
[3:51:57] <%Javaa01> @rcand9 He wants to talk to the magic guy, cause he was just one off
[3:52:09] <eriksdrums> You can farm grass naturally, you can only invest in yourself so much
[3:52:14] <+Grim1952> This hurts
[3:52:17] <%Indigo_Automaton> Knight Shield?
[3:52:18] <Pookiedaexzile> STOP PUMPING STRENGTH
[3:52:19] <+chiazam> Why did he put Magic to 10?
[3:52:20] <CappuccinoGuil> Take out the STR and put in DEX
[3:52:27] <+jiggy_snipe> I doubt Reggie will use the Knight Shield
[3:52:28] <Pookiedaexzile> STR is not Damage
[3:52:29] <%rcand9> @Javaa01 oh alright
[3:52:29] <+jiggy_snipe> no STR

[3:52:33] <jorniev> WELCOME TO THE FAST LANE
[3:52:38] <+PlagueOfGripes> ah yes, the wet blanket build
[3:52:39] <%jackelzxaa> only reason to go for faith if you're playing solo is if you want Heal, which is mp (and you always have mp when you die)
[3:52:41] <+Grim1952> You're not getting much scaling damage
[3:52:44] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah the 10 magic is fine but maybe stay there for now
[3:52:46] <Kghaleon> He's only soul 18, the stats are hardly important yet.
[3:52:49] <derap41> Thicc Dex time
[3:52:59] <+Brickston> @jackelzxaa second chance is insanely useful
[3:53:06] <+Grim1952> You don't get any bonus damage
[3:53:20] <+megaman_sentinel> 1 more
[3:53:23] <Lieutenant_America> It ain't much, but it's an honest build
[3:53:24] <%jackelzxaa> second chance yeah but if you have heal and no offensive magic you essentially have an estus flask or two
[3:53:24] <CappuccinoGuil> @Grim1952 what do you mean, it just went up on the top corner? He has a Dex weapon
[3:53:28] <+Asi9> Not gonna lie, it would help for Pat to be here to explain this stuff better.
[3:53:37] <pi_in_the_sci> he does need to buy magic if he wants to use it
[3:53:43] <%rcand9> LUL
[3:53:44] <%krispen_wa> SOUL OF THE LOST
[3:53:44] <+Grim1952> Up right is defense
[3:53:44] <+RaveBV> why does it feel like Reggie is intentionally moving the cam down to her feet at times?
[3:53:50] <Kghaleon> He can use the iron soul too, unless he wants to use Warding.
[3:53:57] <+RaveBV> just enough to see but not enough to make it obvious
[3:53:57] <ht109> yeah, this needs more "KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?"
[3:54:05] <%s_xylocalsingles> @RaveBV okay Clemps
[3:54:06] <CappuccinoGuil> Get to 100 Stamina so the brain is happy with numbers
[3:54:25] <+Brickston> @jackelzxaa fair, I'm biased because my first built in PS3 was strength/faith with brushwood and DBS
[3:54:31] <jorniev> what about LUCK!?
[3:54:34] <lycandruid> sheilds up
[3:54:35] <Kghaleon> Does he have money for magic even?
[3:54:35] <%jackelzxaa> if you do a regen build des becomes ez the game
[3:54:48] <Blank9> he needs souls to buy at least 1 spell
[3:54:49] <%jackelzxaa> 1000 is enough to buy a spell

[4:19:01] <Johannen> Persevering is alright but because of limited healing items its a tough call to make
[4:19:06] <ronin19xx> If this works out Dark Souls is next
[4:19:15] <ronin19xx> Then BB
[4:19:16] <%allups> we all wanted a new tile set tbh
[4:19:17] <%jackelzxaa> when i did it I bitched out on tower knight and didn't come back to him until i'd beaten like 6 other bosses
[4:19:18] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @jorniev
[4:19:20] <andrewofbob> It‚Äôs a game about losing a lot, much like battle royale games
[4:19:21] <+That_Marcus_Dude> Yep
[4:19:24] <+Grayhammatter> keep hitting that wall, til you punch through it
[4:19:25] <%ggbhtg> sounds like haters
[4:19:26] <CappuccinoGuil> The cool part is that Reggie COULD'VE changed stages. The option is there. It was his choice.
[4:19:30] <Monkeyweed21> they had bitch in their hearts
[4:19:31] <Pookiedaexzile> You're stealing his gains
[4:19:34] <%ggbhtg> ain't NOTHIN wronnnng wit a little bump and grind @WoolieVersus
[4:19:35] <+HelloImTom08> dont bitch out, grind
[4:19:36] <%Visorak6> Tilt really is a thing though
[4:19:40] <%d1stantutopia> https://clips.twitch.tv/AttractivePuzzledGerbilBleedPurple
[4:19:43] <Pookiedaexzile> Reggie aint no Stockpile Bitch
[4:19:43] <%Amaideus> woolieONEGUY
[4:19:44] <andre11dr> Nah fuck it ,do BB first after this, that's the best one
[4:19:50] <+jiggy_snipe> but dying is the Souls Experience
[4:19:54] <+Damie904> Someone clip this for the future. I hope they keep this attitude down the line.
[4:19:57] <%ggbhtg> "Do the thing that I WOULD DO, REEEEE"
[4:19:58] <dastmwolf> nah, you can play however you want. getting stronger is just as good of a strategy
[4:19:58] <%BisoromiBear> That's especially true in this case since TK is 80% gimmick anyway
[4:20:05] <%Cultist_Ryua> Don't take the backseating too seriously. <3
[4:20:09] <danknugglit> Youre doing great for your first souls game
[4:20:09] <Solidnick18> yeah
[4:20:10] <$USOtaku> Smash your head against the wall until it CRUMBLES!!!!
[4:20:11] <jorniev> WHAT ABOUT FUME KNIGHT!?
[4:20:12] <OldManDeckardCain> woolie only tells reggie to "perfect" it
[4:20:14] <+jiggy_snipe> Reggie never pulls out
[4:20:14] <LVL1_Scumbag> Reggie HATES pulling out
[4:20:18] <CappuccinoGuil> I'll disagree on one thing: back off and try other areas is part of DeS's design. That's why the archstones are there.
[4:20:18] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1343849215710142464?s=19

[4:20:34] <+HelloImTom08> Reggart donent coward out

[4:20:39] <%Cultist_Ryua> Reggie can never play Jenga cuz' he doesn't pull out.
[4:20:40] <Tempmael> reggie got gud this session, good stuff

[4:20:56] <+eyezehuhh> woolieGLORY
[4:20:59] <Lieutenant_America> Finish your mission, soldier
[4:21:02] <%khalcipher> Finish the fight
[4:21:05] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus 1-2 is cute and all, but lets see how you talk when Reggie reaches 3-2 or 5-2
[4:21:05] <%Indigo_Automaton> FINNISH THE FIGHT
[4:21:06] <Pookiedaexzile> NO REGRETS
[4:21:08] <%ggbhtg> finished plate, slammed it on the ground
[4:21:09] <bradley1990> you are setting him up to suffer with this attitude
[4:21:10] <andre11dr> Well see when we get to 4-2 LUL
[4:21:11] <danknugglit> !MOTIVATED
[4:21:11] <@Moobot> 1952 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[4:21:12] <+HelloImTom08> gone home in shambles LUL
[4:21:14] <FrostedZaibatsu> Reggie a real one
[4:21:15] <Solidnick18> yes
[4:21:17] <Pookiedaexzile> NOW ABOUT DROPPING THE SHEILD
[4:21:18] <%Cultist_Ryua> And your shield.
[4:21:24] <user_naim> looking forward to the Ancient Dragon boss run in 2026
[4:21:25] <Kghaleon> We'll see in future streams if you can keep that enthusiasm
[4:21:25] <+Grayhammatter> yep, and your shield
[4:21:26] <%Cultist_Ryua> How about raising the shield?
[4:21:27] <Monkeyweed21> Reggie finished inside of the Black Maiden
[4:21:28] <%Alazull> Sure, but you'd never learn it if you didn't push yourself
[4:21:28] <%allups> this is the energy i want to go in with in 2021
[4:21:31] <+jiggy_snipe> it's different when you can't even reach the boss
[4:21:32] <CappuccinoGuil> Nah, hard disagree on that thought, Woolz. Trying out new areas for a breather is 100% valid.
[4:21:33] <%ChoculaUltra> use your panic as ultra instinct, works 90% of the time every time.
[4:21:39] <dastmwolf> can't wait for 5-2 where you won't have anywhere else to go but shove your head against the creepy Boys xD
[4:21:42] <%jeanschyso> Panic will never go away completely
[4:21:47] <bradley1990> lmao these cowards yet you insisted he suicide out every time he got body for lmao
[4:21:55] <Tempmael> watching woolie go from student to teacher is so wholesome
[4:21:59] <+That_Marcus_Dude> @CappuccinoGuil the levels are a gradual increase in difficulty so it really doesn't matter
[4:22:10] <+wicketpelican> Flamelurker
[4:22:11] <%A_German_spy> @Tempmael He does make a great teacher
[4:22:16] <+That_Marcus_Dude> @bradley1990 i mean thats just meta
[4:22:17] <Monkeyweed21> aww man world 3 is gonna be super legit
[4:22:20] <jorniev> ALSO CHEAT
[4:22:21] <%Cultist_Ryua> Reggie now knows the true meaning of Git Gud.
[4:22:25] <KaitlynnHere> Maybe wear a condom next time
[4:22:29] <jorniev> CHEAT ON SOME BOSSES
[4:22:29] <+jiggy_snipe> @bradley1990 little different when you are streaming and people stream snipe

[4:22:44] <CappuccinoGuil> @That_Marcus_Dude It does. The challenges are different. It's good to have the option to go somewhere else and try a different challenge. It's why the archstones exist.
[4:22:48] <%Cultist_Ryua> Yes queen.
[4:22:50] <jorniev> CHEAT LIKE A BRAVE COWARD
[4:22:53] <Tempmael> @A_German_spy legit makes this LP come full circle
[4:22:55] <Solidnick18> yep
[4:23:07] <resloxxx> slow is smooth, smooth is fast
[4:23:09] <%CommanderSqueaks> Soulsborne is a fucking saga.
[4:23:12] <%baka_sugoi> @jorniev psaUp
[4:23:18] <%A_German_spy> @Tempmael It does indeed, haha. The student is now the master.
[4:23:18] <andrewofbob> Know your kill range
[4:23:19] <andre11dr> All the world's are great, maybe 2 not so much but it's still eons above any DS2 level
[4:23:24] <bradley1990> woolie you cheated hard to get through your pt of demons you hypocrite lol
[4:23:28] <CappuccinoGuil> Also, slowly learning the range of his weapon is a MASSIVE improvement
[4:23:30] <andrewofbob> Also good tip in fighting games
[4:23:33] <jorniev> BE THE BRAVEST OF COWARDS
[4:23:41] <%jackelzxaa> that was only 2-2. if it was world 5...he might have bitched

[4:24:45] <OblivionSword1> there
[4:24:48] <%ggbhtg> Only GAWD should have this power...anyone remember Jumper? No you don't.
[4:24:49] <Johannen> @bradley1990 Hell yeah, Woolie did realy used a lot of help and gifts to make it thru. Like a TRUE LIAR
[4:24:52] <Solidnick18> FeelsGoodMan
[4:25:03] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus I do like plotting spyYum
[4:25:06] <EternalJedi> @WoolieVersus after working through a backlog, I finally started Indivisible on Switch, really enjoying it, sad that the Lab Zero stuff killed the tail end for this game :<

[4:26:24] <%ggbhtg> The whole point of the Naruto Storm help was to recommend music for the stream, then the moon casted DMCA doodSad
[4:26:30] <+reallybigrocks> Reggie's lizard brain hates big lizards, who knew
[4:26:58] <eriksdrums> And then you'll get someone lying, and you mash that "poor" button as hard as you can
[4:27:06] <Pillagius> Feels like yesterday Woolie was just an apprentice led by Pat through Souls series. And now Woolie's the Master leading new apprentice to Souls.
[4:27:07] <knight_of_the_edge> @WoolieVersus if your going to dip into magic may i suggest the spell fire spray
[4:27:34] <%ChoculaUltra> not even god could strike through an i-frame.
[4:27:34] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:27:37] <andre11dr> But which God?
[4:28:08] <Pookiedaexzile> It also ends right behind his foot
[4:28:15] <$USOtaku> All the Gods fear I-Frames
[4:28:16] <Pookiedaexzile> Like really close
[4:28:39] <+Grayhammatter> got caught sleepin'
[4:28:49] <%Visorak6> The shield's physical hitbox does more damage than the blast wave
[4:28:55] <%allups> the jump back felt dirty
[4:29:08] <%A_German_spy> karacoLOL
[4:29:17] <%allups> like i know its not but fuck that
[4:29:27] <eriksdrums> If you can assess and learn to dodge forever, you'll be fine
[4:29:37] <Arek_1> @Visorak6 Ah, it follows Mega Man rules. LUL
[4:29:38] <+CookieCutter007> freedom fighter Eren Yeager
[4:29:49] <%rcand9> that was classic
[4:29:51] <%ggbhtg> Drop Shield memes intensifyyyyy
[4:29:53] <+jiggy_snipe> nope learn to lock on sometimes
[4:29:53] <%ggbhtg> sheesh
[4:29:54] <Pookiedaexzile> GET RID OF IT
[4:29:54] <%Livelinne> Even ain‚Äôt shit tho shiaAYAYA
[4:29:58] <Pookiedaexzile> YES
[4:29:58] <+jiggy_snipe> he doesn't need a shield
[4:30:02] <$cureneckbeard> perect
[4:30:02] <%BisoromiBear> go for it
[4:30:03] <+Grayhammatter> get rid of your shield then
[4:30:04] <$cureneckbeard> perfect
[4:30:05] <Solidnick18> if you are good enough
[4:30:06] <%ggbhtg> Shield memes, out
[4:30:08] <OblivionSword1> that's a valid way to play
[4:30:10] <eriksdrums> Two hands. No armor. Naked run let's go.
[4:30:12] <danknugglit> With rolls like that fuck a shields
[4:30:13] <%Irridium> that's what I did
[4:30:13] <%Cultist_Ryua> Katana with magic buff. Mmpf.
[4:30:32] <%BisoromiBear> blocking is for cowards anyway
[4:30:33] <%A_German_spy> Hmmmmm. Sounds like Adjudicator's
[4:30:33] <%ggbhtg> Not a shield, a smashing board Kappa @WoolieVersus
[4:30:42] <andre11dr> If you can react, it totally viable, unless your in poison hell
[4:30:45] <+reallybigrocks> Do shields on your back still block arrows and stuff?
[4:30:46] <%rcand9> never blocking is an option
[4:30:48] <Johannen> Magic in left hand, Weapon in the right?
[4:30:51] <Pillagius> Twohanding build philosophy - You do not need to block, if everybody's dead and can't take a swing at you
[4:30:55] <%A_German_spy> @reallybigrocks You'd think so, but no, sadly
[4:30:55] <%Amaideus> Shields on your back don't do anything
[4:30:59] <%Amaideus> Unless they provide a buff
[4:31:00] <%Javaa01> @reallybigrocks No, they're there for the stats and stamina regen buffs
[4:31:36] <%BisoromiBear> Chat wouldn't be sacrificed because we aren't important
[4:31:40] <+reallybigrocks> @A_German_spy I wonder what game I'm thinking of where that was a thing then. Thought it was a souls game but idk

[4:32:19] <%A_German_spy> @reallybigrocks Yeah, definitely not a Souls game
[4:32:52] <tacostarvedbeast> ganbate reggie kun!
[4:32:54] <%Javaa01> @reallybigrocks You might be thinking of PUBG or another game in that vein, in those some weapons on your back can block shots
[4:32:55] <%d1stantutopia> @reallybigrocks are you thinking of Call of Duty? Riot shield on your back blocks bullets from behind
[4:33:05] <%d1stantutopia> Or R6Siege

[4:34:20] <%ggbhtg> Rollback or rollout
[4:34:23] <%ggbhtg> Rollback or Rollout
[4:34:31] <%Amaideus> Fighting games as a genre just can't do it until people as a whole are willing to suck less
[4:34:43] <%CptnCampy61> SF4 was the closest we got
[4:34:43] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:34:46] <%ggbhtg> All we need is Rollback
[4:34:52] <%d1stantutopia> BUT GUILTY GEAR THO
[4:34:55] <+saltpiggu> Hey, fighting games are cumulative
[4:35:01] <%jeanschyso> No need for a "savior", except if it's Vampire savior
[4:35:01] <+reallybigrocks> @d1stantutopia Maybe lmao but I'm pretty sure it was medieval/fantasy
[4:35:13] <%itsdfc> the Savior of the FGC is more about right place right time right people catching lightning in a bottle. Don't expect it
[4:35:19] <+reallybigrocks> @That_Marcus_Dude That might be what I was thinking
[4:35:21] <%Irridium> I mean Mortal Kombat 11 has sold like 8 million copies at this point if that ain
[4:35:22] <+jiggy_snipe> @reallybigrocks could it be Mordhau or Chivalry?

[4:35:36] <%ggbhtg> Can confirm, hate a lot of things LUL
[4:35:38] <@Solidus_113> Fighting games were literally never good LUL
[4:35:53] <+saltpiggu> Bad take
[4:35:55] <%SomeSageAdvice> perfect example, my friend tried for years to get me into fighting games but never let me practice enough to get good at them, so he always stomped on me
[4:35:56] <Meltgar> @WoolieVersus You know, regarding of fighting games which ones you guys prefer? Team assist, solo, Team 1 vs 1 fighting games?
[4:35:57] <passserby> the fighting game riot is making might make a splash, but that's it
[4:35:59] <Pookiedaexzile> Thuggery is good for the culture
[4:36:05] <%ggbhtg> Do I have to carry MK Deception on my BACK AGAIN?
[4:36:06] <%ggbhtg> Plz no
[4:36:11] <OldManDeckardCain> "FGC? You mean the community that spams terrible tier lists on twitter all the time?"
[4:36:12] <%CommanderSqueaks> Yes
[4:36:16] <%BisoromiBear> popularity kills everything it touches
[4:36:18] <%ggbhtg> Are we bringing back CHESS KOMBAT?
[4:36:20] <OblivionSword1> as long as Fighting Game does not die again we should be fine
[4:36:20] <%ggbhtg> no
[4:36:22] <+Asi9> We just need rollback and need to refuse to buy or play anything that doesn't have it
[4:36:27] <peachy996> Back when Tekken 5 and 3D MK gams were holding it down
[4:36:30] <$SilverRoddo> Fighting games are like religion, good atheists are still gonna go to heaven
[4:36:36] <Meltgar> @passserby Have they at least showed something aside from the trailer long ago?
[4:36:39] <%CptnCampy61> Fuck em we got Waku Waku 7
[4:36:45] <BlackermanZX> man that tweet "fighting games are categorically bad" doodDerp
[4:36:48] <@Solidus_113> If DFO Fighter doesn't have rollback that shit's gonna die so fast
[4:36:49] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus charly23Love
[4:36:53] <eriksdrums> Isn't there a new game coming out from some Toronto dudes?Mighty Fight Federation?
[4:37:01] <Pookiedaexzile> Isn't what Woolie just said how Fighting Games got to the place tey were in the mid 2000's
