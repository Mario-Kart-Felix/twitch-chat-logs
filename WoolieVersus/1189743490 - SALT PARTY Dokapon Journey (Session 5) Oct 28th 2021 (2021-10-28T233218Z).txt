[0:05:33] <leith_aziz> I think the sand effects from what I've seen that I dont like. They look more like mud and I dont think thats the intent
[0:05:33] <DSD24> I think if you were more specific then people wouldn't have just assume you thought her design was bad
[0:05:38] <FlowLethal> the slits are kinda unpleasing just go all out to have no clothes
[0:05:46] <FlowLethal> in some areas
[0:05:51] <leith_aziz> @DSD24 Welcome to Twitter pickyPalm
[0:06:11] <DSD24> @leith_aziz Its why I don't have one

[0:06:55] <+Jiggisnipe> Fugo is awful
[0:07:06] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> at least graffiti girl is cool tho
[0:07:14] <leith_aziz> FYI, I dont dislike Fugo, I just dont like how he dresses
[0:07:14] <%Prevot> fugo is the worst jojo fashion I've seen so far
[0:07:24] <TreeLeafBoi> I knew he was talking about the clothing but I still disagree
[0:07:44] <DSD24> Still don't think its worth getting blown up for

[0:08:08] <%cobalt_phoenix_> swiss cheese lookin mf
[0:08:14] <leith_aziz> Its either that or maybe Bruno looks too good that everyone else ends up not looking as good
[0:08:27] <dds333a> @prevot exactly, albeit not canonically pink LUL
[0:08:27] <Solidnick18> Eh, i don't mind her design

[0:09:29] <%Juriasu> most of the designs in new kof is worse than what was in the older games

[0:09:35] <DSD24> I like it being more clean
[0:09:38] <dds333a> And her suspenders look great in XIV
[0:09:46] <DSD24> Sleek you know
[0:09:47] <dds333a> But the sandals look like shit
[0:09:56] <+Jiggisnipe> Vanessa top half is great, bottom half wack
[0:10:03] <leith_aziz> I have nothing against sandals, mostly because I dont pay attanetion to the shoes (unless it's drippy Faust shoes. He looks legit)
[0:10:09] <@Menitta> also to be fair, nobody really translated well into 3D with KOFXIV

[1:01:27] <+RurouniGeo> Coma and Sleep are two different status effects
[1:01:29] <+MidnightDeacon> lmao Woolie and Reg's look at each other after seeing how much the bounty is
[1:01:33] <Murdercles> is this a DS version of Dokapon? i thought the last one they played was 3d
[1:01:44] <%Seancicle> Chief Justice Wagners telling Mihn, they're gonna be serving time
[1:01:49] <user_naim> On the plus side, the branding of ”Woolie Vs” has never been more on point
[1:01:54] <MyNameIsRasus> @Murdercles this is a DS remake of the first Dokapon, which was an SNES title
[1:01:58] <dds333a> Coma is sleep, isn't it. Reg tried to put Woolz to sleep, and it failed due to the salts
[1:01:59] <+paladinstarbuster> Coma andd sleep are different
[1:02:09] <dds333a> Or are they different?
[1:02:21] <iggeh> oh he got salt alright

[1:36:21] <dds333a> In Kingdom, dopplegangers were also encounters, and it could happen here too
[1:36:21] <MyNameIsRasus> Can't you check the objective? Maybe it has some good info there
[1:36:23] <+Jiggisnipe> ?
[1:36:24] <Solidnick18> huh?
[1:36:24] <MyNameIsRasus> Means he blocked

[1:37:34] <TTouchdown> All classes have passives, y’all just never looked them up
[1:37:41] <+GuardsmanSaber> @WoolieVersus Classes have passives  Amazon - May regain HP before entering combat! Mage - May catch field magic that other players cast! Paladin - May take less damage from field magic!
[1:37:45] <+Shishi1205> woolie has used his pasive like twice
[1:37:49] <+Shishi1205> its glare
[1:37:54] <dds333a> If you can fight each other's clones, then consider it a practice round
[1:37:58] <+Shishi1205> reggies was vacuum
[1:37:58] <+Damie904> Yea just checked, all classes have passives. Mages have a chance to "catch" magic other players field cast.

[1:52:52] <Starmanhero> How far ahead is the manga compared to the anime?

[1:53:08] <NeroInfinite> @Starmanhero real far ahead
[1:53:16] <Starmanhero> Nice.
[1:53:17] <dds333a> I feel like it changes
[1:53:44] <+Shishi1205> @Jiggisnipe it was parallel to the castle
[1:53:44] <dds333a> It helped during the dress quest too
[1:54:18] <+Shishi1205> Remember when Kingdom had specific clones in hell?
[1:54:22] <%Juriasu> I'm guessing the king will give out rewards based on how many each took out

[1:55:18] <+Shishi1205> yes thats why I mentioned that
[1:55:25] <TTouchdown> Until he fights an enemy that uses magic
[1:55:33] <dds333a> I assumed that whoever got there first was cloned, since you had to defeat at least one in order to pass
[1:55:40] <+Shishi1205> You had to defeat your own clone but other players could kill it for you

[2:23:03] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Nani

[2:23:36] <$eco419> The darkest Woolie
[2:23:37] <dds333a> holla at me girl
[2:23:38] <+kewlmyc> Dark Pockets
[2:23:39] <+Rekinsinn> also willing to bet this thought process influenced the event rate in general because your target audience is solo players vs the game
[2:23:52] <MysticMismagius13> I'd use it Turn 2 of this fight if I was him
[2:23:53] <Shwepie> Right is go first. :)
[2:23:55] <%Th3SmartAlec> Woolie LUL
[2:23:55] <glass_marcus> Use reveal for the second round
[2:23:56] <%emMmDeeKay> save it when you absolutely need to for the kill

[2:24:42] <+Shishi1205> 20 hp diff
[2:24:44] <FlowLethal> winner is just who attacks first
[2:24:47] <dds333a> Curse causes the afflicted to randomly attack themselves
[2:24:48] <$eco419> Now he can use the reveal and win
[2:24:49] <RyuuAoi> She can hurt him too doe....
[2:24:52] <%Th3SmartAlec> @FlowLethal and he's got reveal

[2:25:42] <$eco419> I bet is just reading the input
[2:25:43] <+Shishi1205> @Shwepie 22 hp of difference compared to counter
[2:25:45] <%emMmDeeKay> @Shwepie Pockets has a LOT of attack
[2:25:53] <%haitakaa> stung like joe mama
[2:25:55] <dds333a> Counter completely negates strike, but leaves one open to everything else
[2:26:02] <RyuuAoi> Doesn't SMASH do that?

[2:28:51] <dds333a> @ttouchdown which is fun, since the unicorn did it a lot
[2:29:14] <%thesw1tch> yoi could startle yourself and avoid random encounters to move faster

[2:49:08] <+paladinstarbuster> Dokapon has a lot of weird backwards names like that
[2:49:11] <Murdercles> yea medusa was the first right
[2:49:13] <%Double_Tap_That> It's great for palette swaps.
[2:49:20] <DSD24> Gorgon is the big version of Medusa
[2:49:20] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:49:22] <dds333a> Medusa was a Gorgon mythologically

[2:49:58] <+Jiggisnipe> Gorgon is the species, Medusa was a specific one
[2:50:09] <%thespacerunaway> Medusa has 3 sisters
[2:50:11] <dds333a> stheno
[2:50:12] <viewtifulr> big lady in fate
[2:50:14] <%thespacerunaway> they are also gorgons
[2:50:17] <dds333a> and euryale
[2:50:18] <DSD24> Her sisters are shitty btw
[2:50:22] <+Shishi1205> How did that town stay ownerless?
[2:50:22] <pi_in_the_sci> Not true, Medusa had sisters, they are the Gorgon sisters
[2:50:26] <RyuuAoi> Peach is a Grogan
[2:50:28] <wichothemisticalwizard> She had 2 other sisters that were also gorgons right?
[2:50:42] <DSD24> Stheno and Euryale yes
[2:50:42] <+DreyfussFrost> Stheno and Euryale, yes.
[2:50:43] <%thespacerunaway> Sorry you guys are right she had 2 sisters
[2:50:45] <Solidnick18> LUL
[2:50:46] <dds333a> btw, SMT has all three, and they also all change at times LUL LUL
[2:50:49] <%thespacerunaway> there are 3 in total
[2:51:04] <DSD24> Medusa was cool in SMT
[2:51:06] <+shruke> chat: the gorgon knowers
[2:51:21] <pi_in_the_sci> Medusa, Stheno, Euyale are the Gorgon sisters
[2:51:24] <Starmanhero> Stheno was the most powerful if  I remember highschool right
[2:51:26] <+Shishi1205> reflect works vs stat magic
[2:51:44] <%cobalt_phoenix_> reflect at least prevents the status from proccing
[2:51:47] <%Th3SmartAlec> more spinners it is
[2:51:48] <+Shishi1205> the one behind the red chest is 6
[2:51:58] <dds333a> @th3smartalec LUL LUL SeemsGood
[2:52:12] <pi_in_the_sci> I believe they were temple maidens raped by Poseidon and cursed by Athena
[2:52:13] <+Shishi1205> or am I stupid right?
[2:52:19] <wichothemisticalwizard> She had the worst story of all the greek mythos. Girl got sexualy abused by poseidon and athena got angry with her and not poseidon and turn her into a monster
[2:52:24] <RyuuAoi> @starmanhero Why DID they teach us mythology in school?
[2:52:25] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Shishi1205 no red = 6, 1 off is 6
[2:52:30] <wichothemisticalwizard> @pi_in_the_sci Yes
[2:52:32] <+Shishi1205> isnt red 5?
[2:52:35] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @wichothemisticalwizard yea the gods are dicks

[2:54:04] <OldManDeckardCain> reggie don't blame others for bad strategy LUL
[2:54:05] <wichothemisticalwizard> American mythos is just a guy finding sasquach walking around in the trees
[2:54:26] <Starmanhero> Im just saying man Maybe if Washington parted the sea and killed mystical serpents then we'd care more.
[2:54:31] <majeser> nah, America has those fearsome critter things also native stuff.
[2:54:34] <+Jiggisnipe> Reggie has had crap rolls trying to go south
[2:54:40] <%Th3SmartAlec> Levels is the only thing you can't lose (... I think)
[2:54:51] <%thesw1tch> american mythos is a black dude with a hammer
[2:54:53] <%ChoculaUltra> America's got serial killers instead of mythical beasts FeelsBadMan
[2:54:58] <+Shishi1205> The only continent semi safe from mega critters is EU
[2:54:59] <Starmanhero> Tall tales were legit
[2:55:03] <RyuuAoi> @starmanhero Git gud, George!
[2:55:09] <dds333a> @th3smartalec just wait for classic DND level drain Kappa
[2:55:10] <%thesw1tch> @shishi1205 dragons?
[2:55:12] <DSD24> Davey Crockett was a cool legend in America
[2:55:19] <wichothemisticalwizard> @majeser Yeah but those are skinwalkers and those are Indian mythos.
[2:55:21] <+Shishi1205> I mean mythos yeah
[2:55:21] <DSD24> He was in the Alamo
[2:55:23] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @ChoculaUltra we got... paul bunyan and the jersey devil
[2:55:24] <%thesw1tch> davey crockett was a real person
[2:55:26] <pi_in_the_sci> @wichothemisticalwizard There's more to it, American Myth is Johny Appleseed and Paul Bunyan
[2:55:27] <dds333a> @shishi1205 Grendel, my dude
[2:55:40] <%ChoculaUltra> @cobalt_phoenix_ don't forget about my boy the Mothman
[2:55:43] <Starmanhero> You respect JohnHenry he beat the machine

[2:56:18] <+Jiggisnipe> LESSGOOO
[2:56:31] <majeser> @wichothemisticalwizard nah the fearsome critters are like an entire bestiary. separate from native stuff, like the cactus cat.
[2:56:32] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:56:33] <+Shishi1205> Oh yeah mythos wise EU has a big amount
[2:56:33] <dds333a> Lovecraft may have been inspired by a lot of things, but he did invent the creature
[2:56:36] <+Jiggisnipe> TowerShield Mage Kappa
[2:56:37] <%emMmDeeKay> look at that gear
[2:56:46] <DSD24> @pi_in_the_sci True I misunderstood what mythos we were talking about
[2:56:47] <%Th3SmartAlec> Reggie tanking up

[2:57:12] <Starmanhero> Reggie gotta be careful about saying you bit the pillow. Can't be taking that dmg dry lol
[2:57:20] <dds333a> @shishi1205 like our good friend Tarrasque LUL
[2:57:22] <+Shishi1205> Woolie should go to Africa for the better shop

[2:57:47] <%MajorCrasher> wait now that I think about it was Lovecraft American?
[2:57:55] <+Shishi1205> We have seen 5 spins right?
[2:57:58] <drunken_lemur> Yes
[2:58:01] <Starmanhero> Yes
[2:58:03] <Starmanhero> Lovecraft was
[2:58:05] <TTouchdown> In the volcano
[2:58:11] <DSD24> Casey at the Bat was about the guy who ate lost super hard at the game right?
[2:58:16] <Starmanhero> Which is why alot of his books take place ins Mass
[2:58:16] <%thesw1tch> @starmanhero yeah but that things hits like a truck and is pretty rare
[2:58:17] <TTouchdown> That shop had 5 spins
[2:58:17] <pi_in_the_sci> Lovecraft was very American
[2:58:32] <dds333a> Lovecraft was worse, he was a northeasterner Kappa
[2:58:35] <Starmanhero> Massachusetts
[2:58:43] <+Shishi1205> yeah volcano shop was stacked
[2:58:57] <Starmanhero> @dds333a oof man whats wrong with NorthEast lol
[2:59:09] <%thesw1tch> @dsd24 yeah. he just kept the bat on his shoulder and stared at strike 1 and 2 then looked at a kid and whiffed super hard
[2:59:11] <pi_in_the_sci> He was worse then NorthEastern, he was both wealthy and a hill person

[3:10:41] <glumbaron> watching someone play washizu mahjong in another tab, time to watch some people take each other's blood in dokapon too
[3:10:41] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1452876605185998851?t=s4kcX_jYto2dS6pItMmhRg&s=19
[3:10:47] <+Setsuna_seiei> Woolie has been holding onto those galoshes, mint, and salts forever for something that massage happen
[3:10:47] <alroy909> stuck up on that vanish and spinners I guess
[3:10:48] <+Shishi1205> Sell salts

[3:11:08] <DSD24> "Your punishment must be more severe"
[3:11:11] <TreeLeafBoi> what?
[3:11:20] <+Jiggisnipe> at this point, Darkling is just Minh's install
[3:11:30] <%Budda37> Budda37 subscribed with Prime. 
[3:11:34] <Starmanhero> I feel like Minh could over share for ever lol
[3:11:39] <glumbaron> oh my god he did it again
[3:11:41] <+fizzguy47> does darkling not have diminishing returns the more times you change?
[3:11:43] <RyuuAoi> Bang bang bang, Billy !
[3:11:44] <TreeLeafBoi> yeah lol
[3:11:47] <+Setsuna_seiei> what's funny is darkling doesn't help you catch-up it just stalls everyone else
[3:11:49] <dds333a> Spinners and Gems, powerful agents against the uninitiated
[3:11:49] <+RemedyofRevenge> RADIIOOOOOOO
[3:12:00] <+Setsuna_seiei> especially since mknh doesn't capture towns afterwards
[3:12:01] <glumbaron> if he can capitalize on the post-darkling hangover though
[3:12:12] <+Jiggisnipe> @fizzguy47 it really depends on what you give up, Minh rarely has anything of note
[3:12:19] <asakura_ayase> Dragon Minhstal
[3:12:26] <alroy909> like, each 2-3 weeks
[3:12:36] <+paladinstarbuster> They kep letting him do it

[3:20:29] <RyuuAoi> Woolie buy a bunch of vanish
[3:20:30] <%cobalt_phoenix_> this game man
[3:20:39] <+fizzguy47> Ah, because they are on a non-fighting space?
[3:20:52] <dds333a> yes, just like Kingdom
[3:21:05] <+lucaflowe> he's only got 4 turns to stall
[3:21:10] <dds333a> or, mor accurately, just like always (to my knowledge)
[3:21:11] <alroy909> if woolie can survive without loosing equipment or money and only towns, it would be better for him
[3:21:27] <+Shishi1205> 4k health
[3:21:41] <RyuuAoi> Woolie came back from 0. He's got this!
[3:21:50] <+Jiggisnipe> Minh the Machete Man

[3:22:12] <TTouchdown> Field magic only gets down to 1 hp, in kingdom
[3:22:19] <alroy909> even a demon lord needs golashes
[3:22:20] <+Shishi1205> @dds333a he has vanish strats so yeah he just need to get good equip later
[3:22:48] <%emMmDeeKay> just go to africa woolie
[3:22:52] <dds333a> @shishi1205 uhhhh
[3:23:30] <%Th3SmartAlec> I love how Mr. X has definitely replaced Nemesis's spot in the Resident Evil headspace.
[3:23:31] <+Shishi1205> I also think he should move towards africa's shop when minh has less turns left
[3:23:48] <dds333a> @th3smartalec which fucking sucks PunOko
[3:23:58] <dds333a> nah, just joking, they're great
[3:24:05] <RyuuAoi> Actually, Woolie. Spinners. Gonna have to make moves
[3:24:05] <+Shishi1205> thats Cali
[3:24:30] <%xcompleasedad> @Th3SmartAlec Mainly because Remake Nemesis was a punk bitch
[3:24:33] <%Th3SmartAlec> @dds333a It does, sucks RE3Make had all that production nonsense
[3:24:33] <dds333a> I've always been partial to Nemmy just a bit more
[3:24:40] <+Jiggisnipe> you're gonna have to move eventually

[3:25:20] <+Euphbugg> LUL
[3:25:24] <miucsa51> LUL
[3:25:30] <+lucaflowe> it's annoying how darkling just grinds the game to a halt cause everyone is too scared to move
[3:25:32] <JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[3:25:43] <%Th3SmartAlec> The audacity of Minh to get outraged LUL
[3:25:55] <+Shishi1205> Items too stronk
[3:25:59] <%cobalt_phoenix_> man this version of darkling is so much weaker it seems
[3:26:00] <dds333a> exactly, they have to be killing each other for Minh to capitalize, or he has to find a way
[3:26:09] <+fizzguy47> @lucaflowe Welcome to Dokapon
[3:26:14] <MysticMismagius13> or he has to just get luckyu
[3:26:18] <MysticMismagius13> and roll right on
[3:26:19] <dds333a> @cobalt_phoenix_ yeah, that's kinda been the consensus
[3:26:20] <+Shishi1205> @cobalt_phoenix_ you have more time but without the point system yeah
[3:26:30] <+lucaflowe> yeah kingdom dokapon was way better
[3:26:31] <glumbaron> yeah the points were good
[3:26:34] <%Th3SmartAlec> @cobalt_phoenix_ Only thing it has over the other one is the length... which is a greater mental strain on everyone
[3:26:38] <+Jiggisnipe> so this Darkling has less things to do but it gets so much time
[3:26:40] <RyuuAoi> Couch Alliance?
[3:26:44] <glumbaron> if minh focuses on retaking towns once he's done? maybe?
[3:27:01] <dds333a> @glumbaron all he can do, yeah
[3:27:13] <dds333a> unless he wants the chase
[3:27:19] <+Shishi1205> I mean endgame darkling has to be able to get 21 towns at least to change sth
[3:27:22] <TheHeroAppears> just put the tp on the not sharp part
[3:27:24] <+Jiggisnipe> yea Minh isn't so far behind, if resets the world, he can just get towns
[3:27:30] <+Shishi1205> With all the map open
[3:27:34] <+Jiggisnipe> nothing is permanent cuz no castles
[3:27:57] <dds333a> nice, Woolz LUL
[3:27:58] <alroy909> if minh focused get towns after the transform ends, he could catch up a lot.
[3:28:21] <+Shishi1205> @Jiggisnipe yeah castle fuckery with darkling points was the endgame in kingdom
[3:28:32] <+Shishi1205> And poison
[3:28:43] <+Jiggisnipe> monkaS
[3:28:43] <+kewlmyc> WutFace
[3:28:54] <+Jiggisnipe> it sounds like it does it for fun
[3:28:54] <%Seancicle> PogChamp woolieVS woolieCHAN
[3:28:58] <+Shishi1205> It has omega bacterias and poison
[3:29:00] <glumbaron> and if he's focused on knocking out towns while darkling maybe he could get lucky and snipe one of the others if they get careless. 5 spinners each turn gives him a chance of that
[3:29:02] <dds333a> not a bad movie either
[3:29:13] <glumbaron> but yeah kingdom darkling was more interesting
[3:29:15] <RyuuAoi> Like spider shit. Gross
[3:29:25] <+fizzguy47> what he talking about
[3:29:48] <RyuuAoi> @fizzguy47 Komodo dragon

[3:35:47] <RyuuAoi> You'll make the money back

[3:36:28] <%cobalt_phoenix_> VERY true
[3:36:38] <RyuuAoi> It's an opening, BillyM
[3:36:44] <dds333a> it really came out that way
[3:37:01] <%cobalt_phoenix_> one reset at the end is all it takes to pick up towns before the end
[3:37:12] <JetpackMcQuack> don't give up demon lord
[3:37:16] <+Jiggisnipe> Minh is making the right move, he has to pull them back
[3:37:29] <JetpackMcQuack> you'll find a way
[3:37:33] <+Jiggisnipe> also he high level and he started the HP arms race
[3:37:35] <MyNameIsRasus> minh will find a way
[3:37:42] <dds333a> Yeah, it's true, he's dragging them down, yet not moving up
[3:37:46] <+Setsuna_seiei> Minh has been missplaying darkling hard
[3:37:48] <dds333a> but that could easily change
[3:37:52] <%Th3SmartAlec> Minh, the most important part of your Darkling run will be positioning yourself on the last turn
[3:38:06] <+Setsuna_seiei> @dds333a heos doesmt capture towns or kill big bosses
[3:38:07] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @dds333a mainly because he doesn't climb over them after pulling them down
[3:38:07] <+Jiggisnipe> ^
[3:38:17] <dds333a> exactly
[3:38:18] <+Jiggisnipe> Minh needs to do damage then toward end move close to towns to take
[3:38:35] <dds333a> @setsuna_seiei also true
[3:38:35] <RyuuAoi> Other two are making the right plays though. Keep em focused on terror
[3:38:45] <+Setsuna_seiei> all he's doing is ruining everyone else, and eventually they can just avoid him forever, and continue progressing
[3:39:03] <dds333a> @jetpackmcquack Maou getting encouragement LUL
[3:39:07] <+Jcheats> You gotta focus on your own game for a bit, win on your own merit and climb out of the crab bucket
[3:39:20] <dds333a> if you're up for it LUL
[3:39:20] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1452876605185998851?t=s4kcX_jYto2dS6pItMmhRg&s=19
[3:39:35] <+KingKrampus> just got in, what's the manga plot so far?
[3:39:41] <RyuuAoi> Patience, Reggie
[3:39:45] <+Jiggisnipe> patience Reggie
[3:39:47] <dds333a> Shark moving LUL
[3:39:54] <+KingKrampus> how high is the blood pool?
[3:40:02] <+Jiggisnipe> last time, he tried taking a town and Minh killed him and threw away the baller shield
[3:40:03] <%Th3SmartAlec> as long as you are 31 away from Minh you're good
[3:40:04] <A_Family_Man> Darkling training arc again
[3:40:14] <+terry_quest> where did reggies money go?
[3:40:14] <+Shishi1205> Reggie you will sell your armor
[3:40:18] <+Shishi1205> Go there
[3:40:27] <+Jiggisnipe> @terry_quest bought a bunch of new gear
[3:40:28] <+Shishi1205> @terry_quest he bought equipment
[3:40:29] <+KingKrampus> which one is Darkling, Reggie again?
[3:40:30] <dds333a> @jiggisnipe after reneging on their deal LUL
[3:40:33] <%Th3SmartAlec> ...... wow
[3:40:40] <+Jiggisnipe> @dds333a yes LUL
[3:40:42] <MysticMismagius13> banish was OHKO
[3:40:46] <MysticMismagius13> but you have 1HP
[3:40:48] <+Shishi1205> yeah OHKO
[3:40:54] <dds333a> yo, Aurora was beast in kingdom
[3:41:08] <%Th3SmartAlec> Banish is anti Minh tech with his high HP
[3:41:31] <dds333a> @kingkrampus Minh is Darkling, just like every time
[3:41:36] <dds333a> LUL
[3:41:36] <+Jiggisnipe> yea Darkling pauses the game while Minh resets as much of the world as he can
[3:42:17] <%ekodrop> in kingdom banish was killing the opponent but leaves the caster at 1 HP
[3:42:18] <RyuuAoi> Stayin alive. Stayin alive
[3:42:19] <+KingKrampus> aight. how is the blood pool so far
[3:42:29] <alroy909> ultimately, darkling does nothing if minh doesn't retake some of the towns afterwards
[3:42:55] <dds333a> @alroy909 it would just be scorched earth like last time
[3:43:02] <RyuuAoi> They are helping him...
[3:43:11] <+Jiggisnipe> in addition to taking towns, he has do quests cuz when he had a couple towns, they were given away
[3:43:13] <%jepupu> Prolonging everyone's suffering, himself included csbeastWipeouts
[3:43:37] <dds333a> vanish again LUL

[3:50:30] <dds333a> @dashxero LUL
[3:50:42] <glumbaron> ok yeah the towns are visibly built up in this game
[3:50:43] <dds333a> @ryuuaoi yup
[3:50:51] <glumbaron> that's nice. osto is level 6, looks big. others are level 1, look small
[3:50:57] <glumbaron> etc
[3:51:11] <dds333a> neat
[3:51:43] <TTouchdown> Yeah, the towns change appearance as they level up in this one
[3:52:12] <dds333a> Go Bo

[3:53:42] <RyuuAoi> Don't get greedy, Reggie.
[3:53:43] <+Jiggisnipe> check the other enemy
[3:53:47] <gruulmagebeast> so how similar is this to kingdom?
[3:54:02] <TTouchdown> No defensive magic, this continent rocks for magic users
[3:54:04] <dds333a> quite similar
[3:54:05] <RyuuAoi> Time for greed will arise
[3:54:19] <dds333a> Kingdom added a lot of new caveats
[3:54:23] <+Shishi1205> can't he see for how much he can sell hsi armor then buy the new one?
[3:54:23] <gruulmagebeast> woah darkling looks badass
[3:54:27] <dds333a> but removed other things
[3:54:47] <dds333a> Regardless, these games have the EXACT same gameplay loop
[3:55:14] <TTouchdown> Shoulda fought the cyclops, would have made enough cash to buy something
[3:55:18] <DigiDom> is this the 4th or 5th darkling?
[3:55:37] <Solidnick18> either way
[3:55:37] <%Th3SmartAlec> Minh needs to start thinking about how HE is going to get in first after Darkling.
[3:55:38] <+Jiggisnipe> 4th I believe
[3:55:49] <%DashXero> Why not both?
[3:55:52] <dds333a> yeah, 4th

[4:08:33] <+Shady_Zaku> vargBruh vargBruh vargBruh vargBruh vargTech vargTech vargMRKILL
[4:08:34] <+Jiggisnipe> Reggie's overconfidence always gets him LUL
[4:08:38] <DigiDom> LUL
[4:08:42] <%TheBensonator_> All these shenanigans
[4:08:46] <OldManDeckardCain> woolie helped him LUL
[4:08:47] <dds333a> oh shit

[4:09:19] <dds333a> fuck wasn't paying attention LUL
[4:09:26] <TTouchdown> Man, that passive almost never procs
[4:09:29] <glumbaron> i think i would have taken the town too
[4:09:33] <+Shishi1205> give up
[4:09:40] <glumbaron> try to retake them as soon as you come out of darkling, etc
[4:09:57] <glumbaron> snipe if you have it but don't bother setting up a maybe on the next turn
[4:09:59] <DigiDom> Give up is too strong
[4:10:25] <%DashXero> I feel like Woolie saved Reggie there.
[4:10:27] <Solidnick18> just hover around it
[4:10:41] <a_mad_dragon_> why is Pier city landlocked?

[4:11:27] <MyNameIsRasus> Wow Reggie got fucked
[4:11:55] <iggeh> Woolie mad because he's not the protagonist
[4:12:14] <jetstreamlove_R> would be nice if the game gave ya an alt win condition if you committed full on Darkling path
[4:12:45] <dds333a> @jetstreamlove_r not a bad idea
[4:12:52] <GeoGio3> lol thought he was counting to sync audio
[4:13:00] <dds333a> alt win con for darkling is to become Overlord themselves
[4:13:07] <+Shishi1205> bank time
[4:13:32] <dds333a> but darkling can't stay for too long it's too powerful
[4:13:35] <+Shishi1205> Squall Flashbacks
[4:14:06] <dds333a> so there could be like a mini-darkling secret class, dramatically nerfed from normal
[4:14:30] <glumbaron> ok so woolie's worth is mostly cash huh
[4:14:42] <dds333a> yeah, over half a mil LUL
[4:14:43] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
