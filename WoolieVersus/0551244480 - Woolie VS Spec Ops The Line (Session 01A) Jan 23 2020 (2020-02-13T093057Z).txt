[0:13:15] <+QueequegTheater> @Graywolf_the_45th They go through Streamlabs I think
[0:13:17] <%Prevot> baseball is the worst sport ever
[0:13:23] <+Genericmistake> one outs is a baseball anime is like calling TTGL a mech anime
[0:13:24] <muniea3> spoiler this game features specs, ops and lines
[0:13:26] <zamzoph> Girls und Panzer best sports anime
[0:13:27] <+WordsHere> Watch Touch tomatoSmile
[0:13:27] <deviljhojho_> what about cricket
[0:13:33] <%Lion_kun> It's a good anime, it's made in the Kaiji/Alagi style
[0:13:34] <%gatorafan> OH That's not a BASEBALL!!! FeelsBadMan
[0:13:34] <+QueequegTheater> Baseball is only bad if you're sober
[0:13:36] <floralkami> yeah, but it's Baseball....
[0:13:37] <Sunstalker> ROOKIEs Pog
[0:13:47] <CrazyMedicine> Captain Tsubasa is a good soccer anime
[0:13:48] <deviljhojho_> Fuckin A
[0:13:52] <floralkami> um
[0:13:52] <+TristonObv> @isacdee the Line killed us cuz the true Spec Ops was the friends we made along the way
[0:13:53] <%fingalights> Anime makes anything hype
[0:13:57] <deviljhojho_> i watched tsubasa all the time when I was a tyke
[0:14:17] <+locutus_of_the_porg> woolie before you play get a bucket of sand and dunk your head charlsJolly
[0:14:19] <dukenux> Captain Tsubasa is a classic, but probably only if you grew up in a country that plays footie
[0:14:26] <Dova573> I would watch Captain tsubasa when I got off elementary school back in mexico
[0:14:28] <Run44forrest> woolie wont even watch hxh WeirdChamp
[0:14:34] <coreybom> Baseball is FUN to play, BORING AS HELL to watch.
[0:14:37] <%Lion_kun> One outs has an episode about sign stealing.
[0:14:38] <fuji_92> what haikyuu
[0:14:39] <deviljhojho_> yeah i dont think most folk from the states were too into it
[0:14:47] <%Prevot> the real question is when will nintendo bless us with a new Mario Strikers
[0:14:50] <deviljhojho_> it was mostly a latin america-europe thing outside of japan
[0:14:54] <spooksy> i think it's pretty obvious you will enjoy a sports anime more if youve played the sport a little bit
[0:14:56] <floralkami> fed on sports animes
[0:15:01] <derap41> Spec Ops is a curious beast because it doesn't really work if you know what it does. You have to be unaware for it to really hit
[0:15:03] <deviljhojho_> i still watched it tho
[0:15:06] <vVAstrAVv> is THIS the new lp?
