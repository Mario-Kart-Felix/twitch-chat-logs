[0:06:35] <Andrei11Droasca> BAD END
[0:06:36] <presque> No way! Confused? How come?
[0:06:39] <+kyh9> End of Evangelion is just chokejerk propaganda, subliminal messaging where they do it in reverse
[0:06:46] <+BubbaRands> Chokejerk at the beginning and a chokejerk at the end
[0:06:58] <$GoogleyGareth> End of Chokevangelion
[0:06:59] <MyNameIsRasus> Read the porn doujins, they make that ending better
[0:07:00] <VJdarkworld> bookend chokejerk
[0:07:13] <Hawkbone_> What if Shinji did chokejerk in the middle of battle? Would that make it better or worse?
[0:07:17] <ghostspartan80> I appreciate the ending way more now

[0:10:48] <Ashenik1> Becasue The VVitch has of of the best interpretation of the SATAN :P
[0:10:54] <%RioGascar> is it even worth just watching eva if you only just watch it
[0:10:55] <ghostspartan80> I'm so fucked up
[0:10:59] <%CaptainPileDriver> shutup shinji get in the robot, just get in the robot shinji
[0:11:03] <%RioGascar> And dont bother at all with seeing the context

[0:11:09] <+DrHentaiPhD> Getting more and more visible with every new higher def releases is the best character arc
[0:11:10] <xxHungryxx> "Get in the robot Shinji"

[0:11:38] <BearSawed> he likes teppen
[0:11:40] <awalr> he enjoys a teppen
[0:11:47] <+DrHentaiPhD> teppen
[0:11:49] <+sherndon226> It's like Hellsing and Fullmetal
[0:11:49] <Ashenik1> exept teppen though :P
[0:11:54] <Hawkbone_> Its not like GT
[0:11:55] <+SirGO0SE> DOOOOOOOOM
[0:11:56] <+Stupid121v2> The rebuilds are fine if you like the series, but arent near as good in quality of writing

[0:12:26] <+Shikari21> I like the rebuilds
[0:12:29] <%CaptainPileDriver> LIVING IN THE CITY OF NEW ORLEANS
[0:12:30] <BearSawed> Also Rebuilds are not substitutes for the original series
[0:12:37] <xxHungryxx> Shinji is Doomguy
[0:12:39] <splinter1619> get in the praetor suit Shinji
[0:12:41] <MyNameIsRasus> Without Asuka from Germany the whole world would be lost
[0:12:44] <TigerClaws12> congratulations
[0:12:46] <@Solidus_113> There are theories going around that the Rebuilds are actually a new universe/timeloop, based on something about Rei watching Shinji in those background shots across the series
[0:12:48] <cheesedburgers> Rebuild 3 is so stupid it’s hard not to love
[0:12:49] <+waltzqueen> EoE stream
[0:12:55] <BearSawed> if Shinji was doom guy the demons would win
[0:12:55] <ghostspartan80> Rebuild 3 is just everyone hates Shinji
[0:12:56] <Ashenik1> How dare you Reggie !!!

[0:18:05] <+Neoepochx> <3 Hugo Martin
[0:18:08] <Laycas49> @ThatGuyThere03 There was a trailer clip that showed the OG doomguy armor and now people feel like this is further in the timeline and not a reboot
[0:18:30] <Hawkbone_> @Laycas49 There's far more evidence than that to suggest Doomguy is the same as The Slayer
[0:18:30] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:18:33] <unit24> what the heck I can see the TV on the reflection of the glass next to woolie's head

[0:25:20] <primaryfire> you're gonna be a fan when you get the mobile sentry
[0:25:22] <Hydrapissed> mobile turret is soooo good
[0:25:24] <SilverInferno3> Mobile Turret's cooler
[0:25:25] <+hakma> So I've been grinding since the last video
[0:25:25] <%Haarute> did you do mobile turret?
[0:25:28] <+Shikari21> Mobile sentry is way better
[0:25:29] <ghostspartan80> rip mobile turret I guess
[0:25:30] <%HollowedIdjit> No you grabbed the worst Chaingun upgrade ;^;
[0:25:30] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:25:30] <fist_wizard_jay> Now we’re playing with power!
[0:25:31] <Hawkbone_> Mobile turret makes me Kreygasm
[0:25:34] <+thesyndrome> the chaingun is amazing, but ONLY with the mobile turrent mod on
[0:25:34] <xxHungryxx> Has Woolie upgraded his shotgun?
[0:25:41] <Andrei11Droasca> The chain gun melts bosses
[0:25:41] <jarednotwithsubway> MOBILE TURRET >>>>>>>> spin up
[0:25:43] <Tucker0603> mobile turret is better for chaingun
[0:25:45] <ShoMibu> Stun bomb is terrific.
[0:25:50] <peachy996> I prefer Heat Blast
[0:25:55] <CoffeeSlice> mobile turret is amazing
[0:25:56] <VJdarkworld> stun bomb so useful for the shield fuckers
[0:25:57] <SilverInferno3> We gon get combos
[0:26:02] <ghostspartan80> Mobile turret + Rich get Richer = Big wins
[0:26:07] <BlackermanZX> Mobile turret is amazing
[0:26:14] <%GeneralSCPatton> Maxed Heat Blast isgreat as a free AOE on cooldown.
[0:26:17] <dekkitout> Stun on them hater ass demons
[0:26:30] <+thesyndrome> @ghostspartan80 the games loses it's challenge with that combo
[0:26:31] <dankvonmemelord> woolieWHENS
[0:26:34] <%gatorafan> This hellpurge is getting CURAYZEH
[0:26:45] <duskrush> Fun Fact: Heatblast is a Ben 10 Transformation
[0:26:45] <Tucker0603> I prefer heat blast, it's an aoe
[0:26:48] <cheesedburgers> This music is big Metroid prime vibes currently
[0:26:49] <@Solidus_113> you want that other upgrade
[0:26:51] <ghostspartan80> especially useful on nightmare
[0:26:54] <Hydrapissed> mini turret is go0o0o0o0d
[0:26:54] <%Haarute> you want mobile turret
[0:26:55] <primaryfire> mobile sentry is fantastic
[0:26:57] <%GeneralSCPatton> Heat Blast is a safe AOE that doesn't hurt you.
[0:26:58] <jarednotwithsubway> @WoolieVersus MOBILE TURRET is so much better
[0:27:00] <BlackermanZX> You really want the mobile turret
[0:27:03] <ShoMibu> Always loved to stun bomb then switch to anouther weapon like a the rpg. MMm mm.
[0:27:03] <awalr> micro missiles chan is the best waifu
[0:27:05] <SilverInferno3> Maxed SSG Kreygasm
[0:27:07] <Tucker0603> you want mobile turret for chaingun
[0:27:08] <CoffeeSlice> mobile turreeeeet
[0:27:13] <Ahk_90> THAT is the best upgrade
[0:27:13] <fist_wizard_jay> Mobile Turret is THE SHIT
[0:27:24] <peachy996> I honestly prefer 3x shot to Explosive
[0:27:26] <+DarkDash52> Gotta get that Mobile Turret
[0:27:26] <rsg220> YOU'RE TOO POWERFUL
[0:27:27] <Hawkbone_> SSG-Chan is arguably the best gun in the game
[0:27:31] <SteinsApprentice> you've becoming doom guy from the cannon
[0:27:37] <ghostspartan80> Please get the mobile turret it sounds sooo good
[0:27:39] <VJdarkworld> PogChamp not hurt urself
[0:27:42] <+Shikari21> Good youll need it sooner
[0:27:46] <th3_magicman> Super Shotgun too good, AS IT SHOULD
[0:27:58] <+SirGO0SE> barrels o fun
[0:28:11] <%gatorafan> dying to the explosions to the face is for WEAKLINGS
[0:28:12] <dekkitout> "I looked explosive barrels in the eye, and the barrels flinched"
[0:28:14] <Hydrapissed> holograms are great as well
[0:28:20] <peachy996> They work
[0:28:20] <%HollowedIdjit> I think I'm the only person who liked the Triple Burst Shottie, purely because once you got the rhythm down, you had a permanent damage buff and shredded everything
[0:28:23] <ShoMibu> Wow that quick.
[0:28:27] <dero45> Doom guy will soon be Doom God
[0:28:40] <peachy996> I like Triple Burst Shot
[0:28:43] <@Solidus_113> oh hey, what's that upgrade on ammo boost woolieGASM
[0:28:47] <Hawkbone_> You're one away from 3 slots
[0:28:50] <xxHungryxx> Does the hologram work on bosses? @WoolieVersus
[0:28:53] <%FuqBoiSlim> Woolie's the only LPer I watched that bothered with the grenades and subweapons good on him
[0:28:57] <ghostspartan80> The glory kill runs with berserk is unstoppable
[0:29:12] <VJdarkworld> the better ammo helped me in clutch for nightmare just recently
[0:29:14] <SilverInferno3> SnD II lets you glory kill from a mile away I swear

[0:52:18] <Soulbishop> See the idea is your consciousness is all the electric impulses in your brain. So if you directly transfer those electric charges into a robotic neuro network you essentially did leave your meat suit and transfer it into a robo suit.
[0:52:22] <derap41> That's like caying another person

[0:54:29] <Tucker0603> NOPE
[0:54:31] <laserbeaming> It's a Railgun
[0:54:34] <+linSP> HOW DOES IT WORK
[0:54:34] <+The_Lunar_Paladin> essentially the rail gun from quake
[0:54:35] <ShoMibu> Oof, now thats a kick.
[0:54:37] <Tucker0603> MAGNETS BRO
[0:54:38] <ralphfromdk> Gauss canon is basicly a railgun
[0:54:40] <+chuckledarkly> is this just a lore stream or is there gona be some rip and tear??????
[0:54:41] <+GenesisKnight> Gauss cannons are a real thing
[0:54:41] <+Shikari21> Argent energy is red
[0:54:43] <+Javaa01> Yeah, the magnets yank the shrapnel forward and the shrapnel shreds anything it's pointed at
[0:54:43] <Soulbishop> Gauss Cannon is literally a rail gun
[0:54:49] <Hawkbone_> It uses demon energy to make the metal go big fast
[0:54:49] <Soulbishop> how did you 2 not no that
[0:54:53] <Soulbishop> know*
[0:54:59] <Shoegum> Wait why would a magnetically propelled projectile produce recoil
[0:55:00] <fist_wizard_jay> how do magnets work? THEY JUST DO
[0:55:02] <%FuqBoiSlim> @chuckledarkly rip & tear after the woolieLORE
[0:55:11] <+crimsonharvest> the navy's gauss ship cannon is too expensive in ammo and electricity to use lol
[0:55:44] <+bubbli97> @Shoegum there is still an opposite reaction to the projectile flying off
[0:55:47] <1matheuw> laxor
[0:55:47] <SilverInferno3> It really is a laser gun
[0:55:47] <+Shikari21> Argent energy is red tho
[0:55:54] <+dasmause> were you expecting an actual rail?
[0:55:55] <+BubbaRands> Railguns don't fire lasers?
[0:55:58] <+Elky3> theres Rail guns IRL monkaS
[0:56:01] <%StrikeTheErf> true facts, gauss is pronounced "gaows", same sound as "ouch"
[0:56:01] <fist_wizard_jay> Ayyy
[0:56:03] <sonofthedeepsouth> Lasors
[0:56:07] <JDebss> Yeah videogame railguns often act/look like lazers
[0:56:08] <madogod> pretty soon we will see woolie play Tarkov or something to get his fps fix.
[0:56:13] <laserbeaming> I really like the Heavy Assault Rifle
[0:56:18] <pillowwasp> @elky3 look up the train railgun
[0:56:21] <siamzero94> Wait it's a .50 cal AR?
[0:56:24] <laserbeaming> Micromissiles are fun
[0:56:33] <+crimsonharvest> feel bad for anyone that got issued the plasma as standard
[0:56:38] <+BubbaRands> Kreygasm good weapon
[0:56:43] <sonofthedeepsouth> a 50 cal for a AR
[0:56:43] <+NotHereToStream> 50 cal ar is abit excessive, but hey, fuck the demons
[0:56:52] <zv1neda> 50 cal AR WHAT
[0:56:54] <+dasmause> assault rifles in games are always the most boring weapons, but somehow DOOM made it fun, doom eternal's one looks even better
[0:57:01] <ArkSeaside> it's the needler
[0:57:03] <%Solidnick18> lol
[0:57:07] <+Shikari21> LUL
[0:57:09] <SilverInferno3> I'm guessing .50 is huge for a bullet?

[0:57:28] <duskrush> @SilverInferno3 it means whatever you hit goes away
[0:57:32] <+kyh9> Beefed pistol is GOAT
[0:57:35] <JDebss> that's a pistol
[0:57:39] <+Shikari21> Unless you charge it
[0:57:39] <+kyh9> fully upgraded pistol is the best
[0:57:43] <SilverInferno3> @duskrush Damn LUL
[0:57:57] <ArkSeaside> flashlights and lifejackets
[0:58:00] <siamzero94> @SilverInferno3 .50 cal is used against vehicles not humans, it would be a a massive overkill
[0:58:02] <+The_Lunar_Paladin> That thing sucks against demons but would be AMAZING in real life because of how the ammo works
[0:58:07] <+TheDankDemon> it's got unlimited ammo kinda useful
[0:58:10] <+linSP> idk what i was thinking doing nightmare with pistol
[0:58:12] <laserbeaming> woolieLORE
[0:58:22] <Lancaster_H> @SilverInferno3 50 cal is what that giant anti tank sniper rifles use

[0:58:48] <Soulbishop> HELL POWA
[0:58:50] <ShoMibu> Oh convente that were in hell no?
[0:58:56] <ArkSeaside> as far as Im concerned the HAR replaces the pistol especially on Nightmare
[0:59:00] <ThatGuyThere03> christ that's a chunky boi
[0:59:02] <+PriorityDrelb> that pistol is actually good enough to solo the game with a la Dead Space plasma cutter, it's nuts
[0:59:03] <+dasmause> bruh everything is enough to kill a human being
[0:59:06] <Hawkbone_> The chaingun technically uses argent energy for one of its part.
[0:59:06] <Soulbishop> Isnt it just hell gel?
[0:59:21] <SilverInferno3> @siamzero94 @G_Lancaster That's what I thought but damn, no such thing as overkill for demons lol
[0:59:22] <+crimsonharvest> plasmoids is the best dumb word
[0:59:38] <%GeneralSCPatton> It shoots Satan's hot demon gel
[0:59:42] <cheesedburgers> Plasmoids for your spacenoids to kill bugoids
[0:59:44] <peachy996> Hot

[0:59:53] <Ner234> Lots of nerd words here
[0:59:56] <+itsjonseenabopbopbopbop> This is the voice and readings I want to hear to lull me to sleep. at night
[0:59:59] <+slunkymcgee> @G_Lancaster .50 only refers to the internal diameter and not necesarilly the rest of the cartridge's dimensions.
[1:00:03] <ArkSeaside> Minovsky particles
[1:00:11] <siamzero94> @PriorityDrelb I tried that, Braons and the Cyberdemon were not fun but other than that, I agree
[1:00:17] <ShoMibu> The woolie rule, if it shoots its good LUL
[1:00:18] <+kyh9> In Physics, the actual full name for most effects is unpronouncable so we just talk about the jagoff who found it
[1:00:25] <+slunkymcgee> A Desert Eagle handgun uses a .50 Action Express cartridge that has the same diameter as a .50 antimaterial-rifle cartridge but is different in other measurements, for example

[1:15:02] <derap41> It sounds like a Pokedex
[1:15:03] <KatabolicRage> the UAC straight up made these things, for reasons that are beyond me
[1:15:03] <InvisibleMan101> because it is
[1:15:03] <+Shikari21> I wonder....
[1:15:04] <Hawkbone_> Cyberdemons are the biggest bois you could get.

[1:15:12] <ghostspartan80> UAC are fucking nuts
[1:15:13] <+rider_megalon> it is
[1:15:13] <+BionoidLCR> because they did
[1:15:13] <Shoegum> How can it be
[1:15:14] <ralphfromdk> That's because the humans DID make it
[1:15:14] <BlackermanZX> HMMM
[1:15:14] <%Solidnick18> hmmmm
[1:15:15] <+manny2510> Because humans are demons...

[1:34:08] <SilverInferno3> @Snakes_dk I think they do
[1:34:11] <unit24> I don't think people were necessarily wrong, they made the game a lot more colorful and the glory kills faster than they were initially shown
[1:34:17] <VJdarkworld> Rage Comics Guy
[1:34:17] <@Solidus_113> Even higher
[1:34:17] <Shoegum> Now you can fully appreciate the cacodemon and all of its holes in full detaikl

[1:35:13] <ShoMibu> Yes preataro update!
[1:35:14] <%Solidnick18> aye
[1:35:19] <Shoegum> Rage 2 was very mediocre in every way except combat, which was absolutely incredible
[1:35:28] <%Sxy_T_Rex> @PriorityDrelb yes yes yes!
[1:35:28] <%Solidnick18> no
[1:35:31] <BearSawed> rage 2, the mediocrering
[1:35:34] <b_ikki> good thinking tho
[1:35:37] <awalr> should have been something tho
[1:35:40] <Hawkbone_> So if literally all I give a shit about in Rage 2 is the combat, should I buy it?
[1:35:47] <@Solidus_113> Remember, you have the suit upgrade that already shows secrets on the map
[1:35:52] <ThorgrimFunhammer> shoot first, ask your question, then shoot again upon reflection
[1:35:52] <+Javaa01> If you can get it for 15$, sure

[2:01:07] <chaospudding> doomguy doesn't have real shoulders I guess
[2:01:19] <Hawkbone_> Doom 64 has the Unmayker, the most powerful weapon in any DOOM game, even moreso than the BFG. I love that they brought it back in Eternal

[2:02:45] <+YabbaTroll> yo what if in Doom eternal, if you took too much damage in a single second, you get opened up to glory kills from demons?
[2:03:00] <ghostspartan80> don't forget your gauss
[2:03:07] <SilverInferno3> @YabbaTroll There are unique death animations for individual demons in this game
[2:03:14] <SilverInferno3> Essentially demon glory kills

[2:04:58] <dukenux> Gauss Canons <3
[2:05:01] <jeflakvastskaft> when you nut, it push you back
[2:05:03] <Hawkbone_> That motherfucker took TWO siege mode shots to the face. Thats more than a Baron of Hell

[2:05:18] <+luftraumm1> gauss jumping is key to speedrunning
[2:05:22] <presque> That wasn't recoil tho

[2:05:43] <SilverInferno3> @YabbaTroll It's important for the enemies to be hype too
[2:05:43] <+kyh9> Doom Slayer is not a rocket scientist
[2:05:49] <@Solidus_113> gauss gauss gauss. I wanna step on the gauss
[2:05:59] <+luftraumm1> there's a trick to instant charging the gauss
[2:06:10] <+YabbaTroll> @SilverInferno3 ofc, games where you cheer at your own demise are the best
[2:06:11] <siamzero94> fuck your shield
[2:06:41] <ghostspartan80> save it for the baron
[2:06:47] <PerfectlyRipeMangeaux> how do u rocket jump on a controller?
[2:06:51] <Shoegum> So if the energy transmitter works by the same principle as the gauss cannon, does it launch physical "packages" of energy Earth-side
[2:06:59] <Shoegum> Just fucking, shoot this battery to Earth
[2:07:01] <krksobk> never stop the bunny hop

[2:46:15] <jorniev> I wish doom slayer got the stupid quad shotgun from blood dragon
[2:46:18] <siamzero94> easy
[2:46:23] <%Grayhammatter> Easy
[2:46:28] <BlackermanZX> Mick Gordon showed me that Chainsaw is an instrument
[2:46:34] <%DensityD> you can let it cool down
[2:46:38] <Vyneci> Just find a group of possessed and bam
[2:46:38] <+CryptusMaximus> I hope moobot reports when we get 666 viewers
[2:46:39] <+luftraumm1> left trigger actually
[2:46:40] <%DensityD> just don't un-deploy
[2:46:42] <NoireRequiem> what a deal!
[2:46:44] <+Nobrev> BRRRRRRT
[2:46:46] <Hawkbone_> This is the easiest master challenge of the game
[2:46:49] <+Javaa01> You gotta go press the objective button for that to unlock
[2:46:50] <tiaramaki> And a lawnmower too, apparently LUL
[2:47:11] <+luftraumm1> quite a bit of secrets here
[2:47:11] <%DensityD> good button press, now explore
[2:47:14] <+bubbli97> not with single burst but a single deployment so when the barrels seperate dont revert until you got the kills
[2:47:23] <Hawkbone_> The God of Dakka, The Chaingun, may he forever bless us with infinite BRRRRRT
[2:47:23] <Cinnerennic> is this going up on YT?
[2:47:29] <+agumon9000> Martian Winds are intense
[2:47:45] <khanlucas> jump behind the crates
[2:47:47] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:47:52] <tiaramaki> monkaS
[2:47:58] <+paladinstarbuster> BOOSTO
[2:48:00] <khanlucas> there's stuff in the corner
[2:48:05] <%DensityD> push forward combat
[2:48:08] <ghostspartan80> speedy boi
[2:48:14] <+Javaa01> You get a 3 second Haste powerup after a glory kill, this stack with the Haste powerup
[2:48:16] <ThatGuyThere03> real DMC hours
[2:48:20] <siamzero94> try jumping
[2:48:31] <%Who_lio42> hayden: we mde a FUCKY WUCKY
[2:48:53] <cheesedburgers> The code monkeys at our headquarters are trying vewy hard to fix this uwu
[2:48:57] <%Grayhammatter> oof
[2:49:29] <%Shoosler> this one took me like 5 tries before I passed
[2:49:37] <%DensityD> preserve ammo drops
[2:49:50] <primaryfire> I'm guessing this is impossible on ultra nightmare
[2:50:08] <Shoegum> The sights on this gun are so tiny
[2:50:20] <%DensityD> tell that to the ultra nightmare speedrunners
[2:50:27] <%DensityD> they point and click so good
[2:50:29] <Hawkbone_> You don't have to do it on ultra nightmare, you can only play U.N when you finish the game once.
[2:50:44] <+luftraumm1> why aim low?
[2:50:47] <tiaramaki> Nice!
[2:50:47] <pixel_river> nice
[2:50:49] <NoireRequiem> spray and pray
[2:50:50] <primaryfire> really nice of them to give you a silhouette of the last enemies
[2:50:52] <Zedimonx5> Just click their foreheads Jebaited
[2:50:54] <%DensityD> he just does that on controler
[2:50:58] <+Vantesla> One of the small details I love about this game is the shear terror many Demons express when Doom Guy shows up or kills one of them. cryGun
[2:51:02] <ShoMibu> HahaSweat
[2:51:06] <dukenux> and almost a minute left
[2:51:11] <Baziiiinga> Is there a way to go back to the begining of the stream while the stream is happening? Or do you have to wait for the stream to end and upload? I don't twitch much.
[2:51:13] <masterfire23> controller flick
[2:51:20] <J87_fox> behind the crates!
[2:51:35] <b_ikki> @Baziiiinga should be in videos -> past broadcasts already

[2:57:04] <+luftraumm1> you wanna go above it all
[2:57:05] <+Javaa01> Except for that powerup, and doomguy doll
[2:57:09] <%DensityD> THE DEEPNESS

[2:59:32] <+Javaa01> Now you can just pick whatever
[2:59:34] <%Solidnick18> give me that
[2:59:35] <+luftraumm1> frm outside * i mean
[2:59:40] <+luftraumm1> missile
[2:59:42] <Maids4lyfe> precision is super good
[2:59:51] <+YabbaTroll> charge burst
[2:59:51] <jorniev> siege mode
[2:59:53] <+YabbaTroll> :(
[2:59:59] <cheesedburgers> Precision fun
[3:00:00] <+JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> otzSAD
[3:00:02] <KnivesEve> poor robit
[3:00:14] <@Solidus_113> who needs a scope when you can SIEGE
[3:00:17] <krksobk> ads in doom LUL
[3:00:19] <%DensityD> sniping is not part of push forward combat
[3:00:19] <+Javaa01> It looks cool, and underperforms compared to Siege mode, even when hitting headshots
[3:00:19] <gunsrlove> Siege SNIPING
[3:00:21] <+chiluzza> why snipe when you can rip
[3:00:23] <ghostspartan80> Gauss sniper is super good
[3:00:24] <b_ikki> crowbar some planks
[3:00:25] <dukenux> DOOM doesn't encourage camping
[3:00:31] <dukenux> since it's for COWARDS
[3:00:31] <%Shoosler> helps you get headshots easier
[3:00:33] <%JetpackMcQuack> I feel like I'm cheating myself when I snipe in this game
[3:00:36] <cheesedburgers> It’s good for like slow enemies like cacodemons
[3:00:40] <Hawkbone_> Woolie is gonna go watch every singe DOOM Eternal trailer and gameplay video in one day after he finishes this
[3:00:41] <%Grayhammatter> we got major progress
[3:00:46] <gunsrlove> Doll and cell are outside
[3:00:47] <+Neoepochx> the doll is outside
[3:00:49] <ljashbrooke> Use the power of remote detonation
[3:01:00] <+Vantesla> Doom encourages shirt ripper cryKEK
[3:01:02] <$GoogleyGareth> You can get back down through the vents
[3:01:02] <+luftraumm1> the lever was outside too
[3:01:18] <ljashbrooke> Does classic level matter
[3:01:27] <Hawkbone_> Not really, its just cool
[3:01:29] <@Solidus_113> READ THAT SIGN
[3:01:33] <@Solidus_113> DOOR
[3:01:35] <+luftraumm1> for completion and upgrade points
[3:01:40] <BlackermanZX> getting the classic level secret gives you an upgrade point

[3:03:46] <ghostspartan80> I NEED IT
[3:03:50] <+Vantesla> I wish Doom 2016 multiplayer wasn't so bad in comparison to single player campaign... Outside of cheaters it's really badly optimized for online play. Not getting into the mechanics which is it's own bag of worms. Doom 2016 still one of the best single player FPS in my opinion.
[3:03:51] <Hawkbone_> GIVE ME MY WIFE

[3:14:23] <Tucker0603> you might need to charge shot to do this

[3:14:30] <+Razputin217> Thanks for the LuvGift @order_of_mystery
[3:14:30] <awalr> it helps on mouse where you can actually get headshots

[3:15:32] <+Neoepochx> You got it, just a couple more tries
[3:15:33] <+DeathRube> hitting them helps

[3:15:35] <%GeneralSCPatton> AIM YOUR GUN
[3:15:38] <siamzero94> nice dodge
[3:15:39] <+PleasantLeech> the glory kills hardly give you extra time because of the animation

[3:18:01] <Nested_Dreams> O R B
[3:18:01] <theKingRamses> ammo pops up like gas cans
[3:18:02] <NickHatesSnow> pretty rare
[3:18:05] <Hawkbone_> It does
[3:18:07] <+Javaa01> Green ball pickups are BFG ammo
[3:18:12] <DeathByPoke7> its like the chainsaw
[3:18:13] <+Neoepochx> Your runes has it, also you can just find it like gasoline.
[3:18:13] <pillowwasp> It’s rare
[3:18:14] <ll_aja_ll> Nothing wrong with being conservative with ammo
[3:18:18] <%Order_of_Mystery> @WoolieVersus aside from the ammo perk, it's a rare world spawn
[3:18:19] <@Solidus_113> there are also new ammo spawns for it
[3:18:21] <Hawkbone_> Upgraded ammo rune gives a chance to give BFG ammo on a glory kill
[3:18:25] <ljashbrooke> Woolie hasn’t mentioned fighting games yet

[3:25:00] <ghostspartan80> words before disaster
[3:25:01] <%DensityD> force fields stop line of sight
[3:25:01] <+luftraumm1> you got a big bullet that shoots tendrils
[3:25:02] <+kelanth462> BFG is area suppression weapon and line of sight only
[3:25:02] <%Order_of_Mystery> If the BFG shot can see an enemy, it can melt it
[3:25:13] <+SealOfKoalaTea> You don't need that lower part of your spine, bruh
[3:25:22] <UnfilteredComic> Big Orb that arcs lightning in a big aoe, also explodes when the orb hits something
[3:25:27] <MayorRev> does BFG have addons?
[3:25:32] <Hawkbone_> No
[3:25:34] <MayorRev> i never seen them if so
[3:25:36] <+linSP> you using those legs? lemee see em
[3:25:39] <Hawkbone_> BFG Don't need mods.
[3:25:42] <+SealOfKoalaTea> bfg is bfg
[3:25:44] <MayorRev> ah true
[3:25:44] <+SealOfKoalaTea> it simply is
[3:25:58] <+SirGO0SE> Let me show you its features!
[3:26:03] <siamzero94> not from the front
[3:26:05] <MayorRev> he just tanked that
[3:26:11] <Nested_Dreams> Also there's a speedrun strat where BFG shot does more damage is slowed time when picking a weapon
[3:26:11] <%GeneralSCPatton> FRONT IS ARMOR
[3:26:15] <+Javaa01> No, they stupped because you didn't hit them in the FACE
[3:26:18] <+kelanth462> pinkies are weak from behind
[3:26:19] <KnivesEve> they are weak from the back @WoolieVersus
[3:26:27] <%Grayhammatter> not from the front woolie, hit 'em from the back
[3:26:31] <%Order_of_Mystery> @Nested_Dreams wait, what!? Yo thats sick
[3:26:32] <+CryptusMaximus> Just reload the checkpoint to get the upgrade faster
[3:26:35] <@Solidus_113> When you hear the slicing metal sound, that's BFG ammo @WoolieVersus
[3:26:40] <+Javaa01> Hitting a Pinky in the face does a worthless amount of damage
[3:26:56] <Hawkbone_> Pinkies are practically invulnerable from the front. Not literally, but you might as well be shooting it with the pistol.
[3:26:56] <MayorRev> BFG ammo pickups make sound?
[3:27:02] <Hawkbone_> Yup
[3:27:03] <siamzero94> yeah
[3:27:04] <MayorRev> oh wow
[3:27:07] <%Solidnick18> yep
[3:27:11] <MayorRev> thats useful
[3:27:20] <@Solidus_113> Once more SourPls
[3:27:21] <+Javaa01> You're better off shooting wide with Siege mode, since the damage radius gets the Pinkies in the ass, rather then letting them tank it in the face
[3:27:22] <+SealOfKoalaTea> Do we all know that Doom 64 is the REAL doom 3 up in this chat?
[3:27:26] <Hawkbone_> Oh man I can't wait to see the BFG in Eternal.
[3:27:29] <%DensityD> I'm having loads of fun watching this
[3:27:40] <+PleasantLeech> If only the pinkie had a clearly weaker back then woolie would notice, o wait

[3:32:14] <DeathByPoke7> this game does not stop
[3:32:15] <Hawkbone_> @GeneralSCPatton Lore was at the start
[3:32:18] <%Order_of_Mystery> @WoolieVersus as a few people mentioned already, if you fire a BFG shot then pull the weapon wheel up and leave it up, it does *WAY* more damage.
[3:32:20] <%Shoosler> should only take 1 or 2 more sessions to beat the game
[3:32:21] <%Solidnick18> lore was at the start
[3:32:23] <zamzoph> @Vyneci SeemsGood
[3:32:24] <jorniev> CHECK THE LORE
[3:32:25] <siamzero94> this was the best church session i ever had
[3:32:26] <theKingRamses> @zamzoph he read lore at the start and is gonna lore dump again later
[3:32:26] <+linSP> DORIME
[3:32:27] <Nested_Dreams> Lore says that BFG is powered by FAITH
[3:32:31] <%GeneralSCPatton> @hawkbone_ I know, but he's found more

[3:42:48] <%DatAsuna> @Joestar1890 I've offered him a full video run. I'm not sure it's worth the 100 hours it'll take to teach him an MMO
[3:42:50] <+ScoIIym> F
[3:42:57] <heartlesshealer> Stick needed to be stationary for some people
[3:43:13] <+Javaa01> Get that X-Arcade stick, just in case you need to pummel someone
[3:43:24] <%DatAsuna> @Joestar1890 But it's not a hard plan either way. Merely an option for the future
[3:43:30] <NoireRequiem> Sonic Adventure 2 battle when? Kappa
[3:43:35] <$silentblast93> a good stick was pricy
[3:43:52] <+ScoIIym> a good stick is still pricey
[3:43:53] <SilverInferno3> Came back after leaving. Did he get the BFG today?

[3:44:17] <+sevorai> YO that shit is HUGE
[3:44:19] <Hoover_Manoover> All I can think about is my foot going numb in a match
[3:44:19] <%realm_forge> Wool or describes arcade sticks like motor heads describe vintage cars
[3:44:21] <$silentblast93> you can kill a person with that stick
[3:44:24] <heartlesshealer> I hope his foot healed up alright D:
[3:44:25] <DeathByPoke7> The Mas stick is the BFG of sticks
[3:44:32] <+SirGO0SE> i still have a hard time playing with a stick in my lap, i like putting it on a desk
[3:44:46] <ghostspartan80> Oh Jeeves
[3:44:52] <Joestar1890> @DatAsuna Alright. Not saying he should, but as someone who's first MMO was SWTOR, you don't teally need to learn much. I just grinded and powered through

[3:45:43] <MayorRev> Do you think those OGs still play on the floor?
[3:45:45] <heartlesshealer> It's like people learning cursive and then legible print is extremely slow for them
[3:45:46] <%DatAsuna> @Joestar1890 As a guild leader in SWTOR, there's a lot to teach, crafting alone takes long enough to "ruin" an LP episode
[3:46:03] <DeathByPoke7> i sit on the floor but ill use a chair at tournaments
[3:46:06] <%DatAsuna> let alone into stuff like the dynamics of the GTN .etc
