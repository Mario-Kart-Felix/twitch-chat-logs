[0:12:52] <@Menitta> I installed mugen and I kinda wanna try my hand at a character but all I know is Matlab lol
[0:12:52] <%subjectg> Ghetto Warmachine vs Alter Amiba is the best

[0:13:44] <%gatorafan> FeelsAmazingMan
[0:13:44] <Dean_Inbetween> Yea mugen might as well be a kof engine
[0:13:44] <blackout233692> reu died 2007 boat accident
[0:13:44] <SableS139a> MUGEN was my introduction to SNK characters.
[0:13:56] <%fullmetalheartx> so Wollirm

[0:14:31] <Leafboi125> I like the betting
[0:14:32] <+kamig92> Does it sound like Woolie is redlining at some points?
[0:14:34] <%Superbro64> Reminder that Elecbyte died SO long ago, that the license is now lost, and you're legally obligated to destroy all exes of mugen that you own
[0:14:35] <%Superbro64> good stuff
[0:14:39] <Bruno_Tropical> You get PORN
[0:14:41] <+gustavozxd> first mugen for me was castlevania fighter, I didn't even play fighting games back then

[0:16:32] <%DensityD> x tier
[0:16:35] <Dean_Inbetween> I still have no idea how you even make something in mugen, is there a program for it? Or do you have to code it entirely? @woolieversus
[0:16:39] <@Menitta> Greatest mugen character is Rage Rock
[0:16:39] <SheefEatsBeef> OH SHIT MUGEN FUCK YES
[0:16:41] <ChrisM341> The most I did was edit some sprites but never made one from scratch

[0:24:09] <%FuqBoiSlim> Sometimes I'm glad I'm an only child
[0:24:10] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Between this and the Hulk doll dayum
[0:24:10] <coladscorpion> The brother used ultra super and kicked the character out of existence

[0:24:15] <SableS139a> F-fuck man...
[0:24:15] <iamtheTwitchghost> atpFeelsBeardMan
[0:24:16] <1AbuOmar1> i lost my Dragon Quest 7 save with 60 hours in it to my brother. He did it on purpose but lied.
[0:24:16] <%GrassCannon> the day Woolie became an only child.
[0:24:18] <blackout233692> the pain we've been there woolz
[0:24:21] <HereComestheChief> lytMOTIVATED
[0:24:28] <+gustavozxd> that was the day woolie fought his brother shirtless in the rain
[0:24:35] <SableS139a> The perks of being an only child.
[0:24:37] <princegeo> that changed our man's life
[0:24:39] <taquito_blade> fuck....and setting mugen up properly is hard enough as it is to a non pc plater
[0:24:40] <%Irridium> shoutout to my brother who overwrote my Grandia 2 save when I was right at the end boss
[0:24:41] <%ChoculaUltra> I had a cousin completely destroy my only PS2 memory card when I was halfway through MGS2 for the first time. I still haven't gotten over it. FeelsBadMan
[0:24:42] <taquito_blade> player*
[0:24:44] <Bruno_Tropical> FUCK
[0:24:49] <%LastHazzerd> well... it's a good lesson i guess
[0:24:50] <dapperskeleton69> and thus, Woolie began his journey to where we are now
[0:24:52] <+LCLSmoothie> dmc4_nero_crying.mp4
[0:24:54] <Solidnick18> lesson learned i suppose
[0:24:56] <Megablueflash> @sables139a I actually mained Frieza in Hyper DBZ, all the characters they made just have so much care put into them. And the fact that they're still making them is awesome
[0:24:57] <+paladinstarbuster> FeelsBadMan
[0:24:59] <LocalRobyn> is it just me or are they quiet
[0:24:59] <Dean_Inbetween> I HAVE NO BROTHER- punished woolie
[0:25:02] <Pappajimbo> we all learn the hard way
[0:25:04] <+gustavozxd> I lost my xenoblade X 100+ hour save file once
[0:25:09] <Ciriliko> Selling your games DansGame
[0:25:15] <+tinyswampthing> my best friends brother sold his ps3 and all his games for cigarettes
[0:25:21] <coladscorpion> Woolie combed his hair backwards in the rain... and pulled his hulk doll out... the beat down would be glorious
[0:25:25] <@Menitta> I wish I kept Arms
[0:25:27] <iamtheTwitchghost> true

[0:34:58] <%FuqBoiSlim> yo that hyper dragon ball fighter was sick as hell. Golden Freiza was the final boss and the arcade mode had co-op so you could 2v2 it

[0:35:28] <%CaptainPileDriver> but for real could we get a bit of an increase in volume on your end, like a little smidge up
[0:35:35] <Dcrapman77> So its pronounced mewgin?
[0:35:39] <lazerscraper> @thesaltminer Arm Joe was a fighter maker game i think
[0:35:42] <%LastHazzerd> it really depends on what the other characters can do
[0:35:43] <ChrisM341> Dong Dong never bet on Naruto

[0:38:20] <%ChoculaUltra> Nidhogg is truly a game that tests your fighting game prowess. And how loud you can yell profanities.
[0:38:24] <SunxAngel> Oh?
[0:38:32] <%illtima> makes sense
[0:38:38] <%CaptainPileDriver> nidhogg is a game that can truly last for hours
[0:38:38] <shinichizio> I respect whoever makes the 'Regular Ass [Character]' characters. In a world with Rare Akumas and Orochi Geese, seeing Regular Ass Iori beat someone with sheer aggression is great.

[1:03:56] <@Solidus_113> I don't think Mugen can handle the sprite layers actively for stages
[1:04:00] <TheGershon> instead of using scale you should charge
[1:04:01] <%ggbhtg> Sean noooooo
