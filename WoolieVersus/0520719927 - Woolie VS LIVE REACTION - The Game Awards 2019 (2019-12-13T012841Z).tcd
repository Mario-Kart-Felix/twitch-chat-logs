[1:57:55] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> LUL MARKETING
[1:57:56] <sirnoid> REGGIE SOLD HIS SOUL, that's a damn shame
[1:58:00] <grimenigma> Discount max and discount woolie
[1:58:01] <hassanico2> UNLIKE CONSOLES LUL

[1:58:08] <konarius> this is the first time I see stadia related that is not the podcast
[1:58:09] <0rond> that dog lagged through the wall
[1:58:13] <Wattermany> RARE FOOTAGE OF @STADIAWORKS
[1:58:13] <redgunnit> poltergeist dog
[1:58:14] <+freeizone> 4K60*
[1:58:14] <%SanguineQuest> I like how the "Stadia doesn't take up any space," pitch shows the console taking up basically no space
[1:58:14] <NickHatesSnow> CONSOLES CANT PLAY GAMES
[1:58:15] <+isitaspider> Do they even have a single 4k game yet?
[1:58:15] <+stef5949> Big Cringe
[1:58:16] <yuribo26> 4k 60 FPS PogChamp
[1:58:17] <zecht89> it also doesn't work

[1:58:17] <%RioGascar> with the worst controller ever
[1:58:20] <Needwagon_for_speedwagon> Reggie sold his soul to become Leeroy

[2:35:26] <queenofspoopy> The new album is called father of all motherfuckers
[2:35:27] <allenpie04> BEAT SABER
[2:35:33] <theotrainwreck> he is expecting a real crowd, he wasn't told
[2:35:35] <LtThunderbolt> zoomer music
[2:35:38] <CazadorDeWulf> You just described the Opera Wools
[2:35:41] <NewWillinium> rocks out
[2:35:47] <funkerbuster> still better than dj khaled making encores on OWL
[2:35:48] <+freeizone> would hate symphonies
[2:35:52] <+skyheys> It's hard to stay up for a full concert screaming
[2:35:55] <xshadowxx416> this song beat live
[2:35:55] <queenofspoopy> It comes out next year
[2:35:58] <@Solidus_113> Beat Saber is fun
[2:35:59] <+condemned_15> ew this is terrible
[2:35:59] <sparkly_yoyo> GD are doing what they can, I honestly feel bad for them
[2:36:02] <wanocountry> Green Day sucks, bring back Nirvana
[2:36:04] <shinyBats> Nothing more punk rock than an audience silently sitting on cushioned folded chairs
[2:36:05] <theotrainwreck> this no good
[2:36:08] <%RioGascar> so beat saber added 360/90 degrees music tracks reccently
[2:36:12] <+chrishnaw> That's why orchestra is the only REAL music
[2:36:13] <LtThunderbolt> vote skip this cutscene
[2:36:14] <masterfire23> @funkerbuster no that was hilarious
[2:36:14] <WanderingSwordsman> God this is so freaking surreal
[2:36:16] <%tiredofthelights> When's GG Allin and Kurt Cobain collab
[2:36:16] <renegadorade> GO AWAY
[2:36:17] <CazadorDeWulf> Whoever picked them to perform for this is very out of touch with this generation of gamers just sayin'
[2:36:22] <Solidnick18> reggie pls
[2:36:27] <sirnoid> Look at that stupid excuse for a mosh pit in 2019 GAMES AWARDS
[2:36:28] <theotrainwreck> the only newish Green Day song I've heard was Bang Bang and I thought that was fun
[2:36:28] <NewWillinium> I am loving this. More Green Day is always better
[2:36:29] <wanocountry> Should've invited Foo Fighters instead
[2:36:30] <allenpie04> Damn Green Day
[2:36:33] <+freeizone> dorito pope picked them
[2:36:33] <Cobalt_Bluesy> Bring back the guy who did Ready To Die. I can’t remember his name, but that song was fucking ridiculous and I loved it.
[2:36:35] <%konekoryugamine> THEY ARE FUCKING KILLING IT, ALL YA'LL ARE IN DENIAL!

[2:37:05] <Infeirno23> @CazadorDeWulf be honest if they tried to pick someone for "this" generation you would still hear bitching
[2:37:06] <+Rezca> Instruments need to be louder
[2:37:07] <sparkly_yoyo> @renegadorade awards? we just want trailers
[2:37:09] <@akuda_bar> why does he have to keep begging them to pay attention
[2:37:13] <wanocountry> Limp Bizkit >>> Green Day
[2:37:15] <DeadStage> I can respect that they're trying their best.
[2:37:15] <FstSergeant8595> VGA Twitch channel chat is calling Green Day a boomer band. Man am i getting old or is chat just stupid?

[2:37:43] <%RioGascar> probably because the audio for music is trash for this palce @akuda_bar
[2:37:43] <sirnoid> The camera work and the knowledge that this is the games awards is what's killing me the most here

[2:37:48] <allenpie04> back to games
[2:37:51] <sparkly_yoyo> It ain't bad but they're trying to squeeze emotion out of these souless creatures

[3:11:47] <EndgameContent> I would play Sekiro again if there was a boss rush
[3:11:47] <%hungrypengu> sekiro has some of the best boss fights I just prefer the replayability and diversity of soulsbornes
[3:11:48] <+paladinstarbuster> ITS GOOD CONTENT THO
[3:11:51] <+laazybulbasaur> laazybulbasaur subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[3:11:51] <DatAsuna> Minh is making excuses for it being a shit tenchu game

[3:12:18] <+OroOreo> so no smash huh
[3:12:18] <DatAsuna> People screamed at me for calling it a souls game, but loking at it as a tenchu game it sucks ass
[3:12:20] <+friskybuns9> sekiro was really good, but honestly im surprised it won. i thought it would be smash because of the amount of people that play it
[3:12:21] <crimsonsaens> It's fine to have lab time for your stream, Woolie

[3:13:48] <sirnoid> @vicious_rage Pat must have said that only he has it or specifically that Woolie doesn't have it for this to have happened

[3:15:45] <zeroraider> Sekiro tilts Woolie when the game isn't even on.
[3:15:48] <gayyyymoutain303> Woolie need Pat to plays that kind of game
[3:15:50] <+omenzazu> like naruto

[3:16:13] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> I was happy Disco won 4 award
[3:16:16] <+freeizone> sekiro is filler souls until elden ring
[3:16:20] <gayyyymoutain303> Jump Force
[3:16:22] <asturiashere> its definetley not the game of the year tho
[3:16:26] <Mrchiselfist> @RAAAAAINMAKER Agreed.
[3:16:29] <Fujiwara_92> BAD AWARD WAS BAD HUH
[3:16:31] <+yunngin> it deserved that shit
[3:16:32] <laguerrilha> there was like 6h left
[3:16:32] <kikosmore> Loved Dark souls. Loved Bloodborne. Not too horny about Sekiro.
[3:16:33] <@akuda_bar> yeah disco fucking deserved it
[3:16:34] <Twon_From_Wakanda> Reggie when you gonna start streaming bro!
[3:16:38] <+AsinPersuasion> woolie is going to come back to sekiro in 2 years and fall in love with it
[3:16:39] <DatAsuna> Guess what the ending sucks just like the rest of the story
[3:16:39] <konarius> Woolie, Pat, Reggie and Ladies must play Disco Elysium
[3:16:40] <DXLelouch24> Now Woolie has to finish it, it won GOTY
[3:16:41] <DestroPrime83> @WoolieVersus Atleast you can fill that sekiro whole with Ghost of Toushima

[3:16:48] <DensityD> Kreygasm Reggie Streams Kreygasm
[3:16:52] <crimsonsaens> Just finish the first path

[3:16:56] <Wattermany> please LP jump force after ur done with ur NUNS
[3:16:58] <Blackjackal95> Sekiro is definitely best as one consistent continuous playthrough
[3:16:59] <+Rezca> I just want the Bad End
[3:16:59] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus It would take you a MINIMUM of 3 streams to get 2 endings
[3:17:03] <hassanico2> @WoolieVersus And then there's Owl, and Owl Father, and Dragon, and Demon, and Saint...
[3:17:06] <asturiashere> honestly fuck it disco prolly game of the year tbh
[3:17:11] <asturiashere> or outer wilds
[3:17:11] <+megapisces89> forsenPuke4 SantaHat
[3:17:11] <DensityD> I'm getting hype for GodFall, because I have baby taste
[3:17:12] <crimsonsaens> The bad ending is the best ending anyway
[3:17:13] <hassanico2> LET MINH DO IT ON STREAM!
[3:17:16] <Nocturnment> As much as I love Sekiro, you don't need to play it if you don't like it

[3:28:14] <asturiashere> so yeah no way this can be done on the ps4 and its deffinetley exaggerated
[3:28:15] <CharileMurphyPendelton> Death Stranding didnt win because Geoff Keeley is a Kojima fanboy ... -_- it be too obvious

[3:28:41] <Milo_Oda> is this gonna have sekiro syndrome and only let you use a jatana DansGame
[3:28:50] <Milo_Oda> *katana
[3:28:53] <Blackjackal95> I need a Warhammer Fantasy game that looks like this
[3:28:57] <+Pookiedaexzile> Sorry this bitch old, We'll have a 12 year girl be your archerfor the anime pedos
[3:28:57] <renegadorade> There was a bow in the new trailer
[3:29:00] <IndoorSitup> This Game Awards can be summarised in one word: "Oh."
[3:29:01] <+Saggitori> @asinpersuasion IT'S BEEN
[3:29:16] <zafooru> dual wield cool
[3:29:19] <+Saggitori> good
[3:29:20] <CharileMurphyPendelton> watch Ghost of Tsushima gets nom for GOTY and gets snubbed for Dragon Age 4 lol
[3:29:28] <laschoelmachooo> this was a shit show
[3:29:31] <Pnutz409> Tenchu vibes
[3:29:31] <asturiashere> i do like the idea of like hey, real japan.
[3:29:35] <Milo_Oda> they arent gonna make DA4 Kappa
[3:29:36] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @AsinPersuasion
[3:29:40] <asturiashere> not like, anime shit or whatever
[3:29:41] <dukenux> man, RE2 got robbed
[3:29:41] <+Mailboy> How did woolie feel about NMH3?
[3:29:44] <CharileMurphyPendelton> i agree this GOTY was rigged af
[3:29:56] <detritus25> I came in at the end of the game awards and could feel the collective salt wash over me.
[3:29:57] <jorniev> the reason im interested in this game is kurasawa
[3:30:00] <@Solidus_113> Everyone forgets about Nioh 2
[3:30:09] <funkerbuster> man sick of sekiro watches more sekiro clones
[3:30:10] <dukenux> oh okay, this is now looking dangerously close to Sekiro
[3:30:13] <+Saggitori> looks like ass creed
[3:30:17] <Wattermany> hope nioh 2 is good
[3:30:19] <asturiashere> even sekiro because its a soulsborne game didnt quite really stick to realistic japan
[3:30:19] <NDOwil> i can't resist a cool bamboo hat
[3:30:28] <%hungrypengu> Q1 2020 is so stacked lol
[3:30:33] <asturiashere> not that anyone expected it to
[3:30:36] <+PatchworkSquid> this screams batman
[3:30:37] <m4tt_yn> hella stacked
[3:30:37] <vVAstrAVv> yeah thats asscreed
[3:30:37] <%Irridium> I mean Nioh 2 is Nioh 2. Solid-ass game going by the demo.
[3:30:37] <CharileMurphyPendelton> Nioh 2 and all other pure Japanese developed games will always get snubbed
[3:30:42] <m4tt_yn> guard yo wallet's y'alll
[3:30:43] <+KingOfTheGeats> the Nioh 2 demo gave me hope it will good
[3:30:52] <yuribo26> MASAKA
[3:30:55] <+freeizone> nioh 2 is more like dlc not much content.. heck the first game was running the same maps over and over
[3:31:01] <2daygamer> MASAKA
[3:31:03] <Ciglossonjr> If this is as batman or assassins creed as it looks, i'm going to vomit blood
[3:31:07] <@Solidus_113> THIS SHIT RIGHT HERE
[3:31:08] <m4tt_yn> @KingOfTheGeats hope it is 1st had some issues but i need it
[3:31:10] <@Solidus_113> FUCKING PRIME
[3:31:16] <%hungrypengu> nioh was already good it just lacked enemy variety.

[3:32:24] <funkerbuster> the mongol flame arrow in the background is sick
[3:32:24] <kikosmore> It may look nice but , aesthetic vs gameplay friend.
[3:32:26] <renegadorade> THre's a;ways a hud
[3:32:27] <dukenux> this should be to 3 hits tops
[3:32:28] <+Pookiedaexzile> this game is gonna be boring as shitby hour 3

[3:33:07] <gayyyymoutain303> hey hey hey people
[3:33:16] <CharileMurphyPendelton> GOTY felt like an apology for snubbing all the Miyazaki games getting snubbed in previous game awards
[3:33:21] <%hungrypengu> I just want another Yakuza samurai game localized
[3:33:25] <Picia000123> cant wait for Woolie to stop caring about this one
[3:33:27] <jorniev> PLAY DISCO
[3:33:29] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Ashina Isshin tho

[3:33:43] <gayyyymoutain303> Woolie is to hard
[3:33:46] <+paladinstarbuster> not better than sekiro as a game though
[3:33:48] <Doodle_Taco> Sakura Dragon tho
[3:33:49] <topherg789> sekiro was an amazing game

[3:34:06] <Twon_From_Wakanda> FailFish
[3:34:06] <TigerClaws12> can't wait for Ghost of Tsushima LP to be canceled half way through LUL
[3:34:08] <CharileMurphyPendelton> Fact Sekiro winning GOTY is apology for Bloodborne not winning GOTY
[3:34:09] <dukenux> @asturiashere yeah, this is why Tsushima caugth my interest
[3:34:09] <Shwepie> It's weird that Ghost of Tsushima and Sekiro got announced at the same time and then GoT just disappeared forever.
[3:34:12] <DatAsuna> The same studio that's making sonic did the SWTOR cinematics lol
[3:34:13] <+freeizone> woolie is gonna get bait and switched
[3:34:16] <Picia000123> Sekiro and Disco Elysium got some Im happy
[3:34:19] <dukenux> i just want "Akira Kurosawa: the game"
[3:34:21] <funkerbuster> SEKIRO is wooile's omikron
[3:34:26] <@Solidus_113> I think the Tsushima faces just need another texture pass and some sub-surface scattering
[3:34:28] <YouTubeGoDown> at least DMC5 won best action game
[3:34:40] <yeahthatalex> I’m happy Sekiro won
[3:34:41] <+freeizone> yea DMC5
[3:34:44] <CharileMurphyPendelton> but Astral Chain though
[3:34:45] <laguerrilha> LUL
[3:34:47] <Rexwarrior1> Ghost pf Tsutshima was announced a while before Sekiro,m

[3:34:47] <vicious_rage> LUL
[3:34:54] <chronoxgp> NIOH
[3:34:55] <renegadorade> DMC V Earned their award
[3:34:55] <%hungrypengu> @solidus_113 a bit of a lighting change and a texture touch up is fine
[3:34:56] <+unclekulikov> Seikiro: Shadows die on this hill
[3:34:56] <pirateofpie> LUL
[3:34:57] <CharileMurphyPendelton> DMC5 winning was cool though

[3:35:40] <%Order_of_Mystery> tsshima looks badass
[3:35:40] <+Shinted24> @charilemurphypendelton DMCV was a better game overall than Astral Chain although they’re both fantastic games.
[3:35:43] <asturiashere> how about those games, eh gamers
[3:35:48] <colorofillusion> Sekiro is great though BibleThump

[3:36:07] <m4tt_yn> later nerds
[3:36:11] <asturiashere> did RE2 even win anything
[3:36:11] <laguerrilha> Can we even call that a dragon?
[3:36:15] <+Shinted24> It’s kinda crappy that REmake 2 didn’t win anything.
[3:36:19] <asturiashere> it was nominated for like everything but
[3:36:21] <yuribo26> LOOK UP GLORYBRING
[3:36:22] <%hungrypengu> @shinted24 I just think the action in dmc5 is much smoother than astral chain
[3:36:25] <yuribo26> GLORYBRINGER
[3:36:27] <Doodle_Taco> Thats a mass produced Eva
[3:36:28] <Raztron> your weak woolie
[3:36:29] <+DarksideBluez> RE2 was a remake that was inferior to REmake(GC) so no surprise it didn't win
[3:36:33] <vicious_rage> Dragons are stupid - Plague
[3:36:34] <CharileMurphyPendelton> Sekiro won to apologizes for all other Miyazaki souls games not winning GOTY confirmed
