[0:07:21] <%saladin1911> @jiggy_snipe Get outta here. People like Ash, he's cool
[0:07:29] <brunoberserk> i still think kof maximum impact 2 is better than MIRA ,but ok
[0:08:04] <%jiggy_snipe> @saladin1911 didn't say no one likes him but heard more negativity compared to the other protags
[0:08:05] <%ggbhtg> Allegedly, the balance fixes from MI2 to MIRA aren't that substantial
[0:08:10] <+Mordexai0> King Of Fighters also had a series called King Of Fighters EX so don't get confused.
[0:08:18] <%ggbhtg> but that added Blue Mary tho
[0:08:29] <%ggbhtg> M A N I A X
[0:08:42] <%ggbhtg> They probably thought it looked like DOA LUL
[0:08:47] <kairumustdie> featuring dante from the devil may cry sereis
[0:09:04] <%ggbhtg> MI2 = 06
[0:09:19] <deafmelone> it was a trick
[0:09:20] <+MrBaconJam> featuring Cowboy Vergil Kappa
[0:09:22] <%ggbhtg> Everyone bought it tho
[0:09:33] <%ggbhtg> Everyone got fooled
[0:09:37] <brunoberserk> fucking paul marketing
[0:09:40] <kairumustdie> that confused the shit out of me when I saw it at a used game store
[0:09:41] <+TopTieramisu> they added blue mary, but turned her into super sonic
[0:09:55] <%ggbhtg> They bought it AND bought it
[0:10:08] <%saladin1911> @jiggy_snipe I've not really seen much negativity. He's no Kyo or K' sure but at least he's not Shun'ei woolieF
