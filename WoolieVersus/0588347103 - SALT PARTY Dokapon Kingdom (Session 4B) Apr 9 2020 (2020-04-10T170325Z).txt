[0:00:15] <Riottrio> Hey, reggie. We love you
[0:00:23] <%Livelinne> Hiiiii bleedPurple
[0:00:31] <Vohs_Bru> Yellow guys!
[0:01:17] <jevichrono> The troubles
[0:01:21] <%MaddyCaddy> Dogs can't get it
[0:01:27] <jevichrono> But cats are at risk
[0:01:33] <Riottrio> Indoor cats are already isolating, so just have an indoor cat
[0:01:39] <royb2> That's a pretty alarmist statement. The cats can get infected by covid-19 but so far none have died of it
[0:01:43] <%GenesisKnight> Tell Pat to protect Elmo
[0:01:49] <binkarus> Ê¨°Âõû„ÄÅ„É¨„Ç∏„ÅÆÈõ™Ëæ±
[0:01:52] <Vohs_Bru> cat in a box
[0:01:54] <sexdrugsvideogames> yoyoyo
[0:01:57] <royb2> Dogs are not suspectible to the disease but can in rare cases get it
[0:02:00] <Riottrio> Elmo doesn't go outside, so Elmo will be fine
[0:02:02] <SetsuRyuu> cats can get covid19 but they show no symptons and don't pass it to humans, it's what I saw in tests
[0:02:20] <Vohs_Bru> converging 2 0
[0:02:34] <SetsuRyuu> they like forced a bunch of the virus in the kitties
[0:02:44] <djazo> mortal shell looks great tho
[0:02:46] <royb2> @SetsuRyuu Cats can get symptomatic. Bronx tigers and a housecat in Belgium got sick. Also chinese animal tests showed that cats can transmit it to other cats
[0:02:53] <sexdrugsvideogames> Minh is the marauder
[0:02:54] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[0:03:16] <%SirGO0SE> Reggie sittin there like "I AINT WEARIN NO DRESS"
[0:03:19] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus how about loser has to eat a ghost pepper, in honour of Hot Pepper Gaming
[0:03:23] <binkarus> Loser should buy leather shoes and shine them for the others
[0:03:27] <%chiluzza> THE CUBE CONTAINS ALL
[0:03:27] <%supersugoisenpai1> Cube is more embarassing
[0:03:29] <+gratedjuice> The loser changes their name
[0:03:31] <%jiggy_snipe> stop breaking kayfabe

[0:03:44] <+therabbles> the cube fear was a lie BibleThump
[0:03:44] <jevichrono> Kayfabe broken
[0:03:55] <%MaddyCaddy> Eat a spoonful of Wasabi
[0:03:55] <gunsrlove> No shame? Go naked then Kappa
[0:03:58] <SetsuRyuu> @royb2 it's probably rare if there was another test showing the opposite. Tons of tests will still go around studying this
[0:03:58] <Riottrio> Woolie laid in garbage, a dress is nothing

[0:04:21] <Xeno351> REGGIE SUPER CARES

[0:05:47] <jaygee303> We back?
[0:06:00] <%NWannabe> Reginald the Frightened must die
[0:06:07] <+therabbles> Reggie is the hero of this stream leave him alone BibleThump
[0:06:15] <Riottrio> Reggie is a sweetheart
[0:06:16] <@Solidus_113> you need POWER
[0:06:17] <Junkles> yeah darkling is part of the game
[0:06:19] <%andrei11dr> Also fuck over the towns more
[0:06:20] <%jiggy_snipe> release the good boy limiters
[0:06:21] <topendbuzza> sack up reg
[0:06:22] <+Kduff89> instead of countering just wake up super and say "do you want me to be a woman?" and then hand them your number
[0:06:23] <%Irridium> quit bein' a coward
[0:06:31] <chambatron> Lawyer up, suit up and hit the gym Reggie
[0:06:32] <jevichrono> Ultra Minhstinct was trained on everyday occurrence
[0:06:35] <yeetdabsenpai69> YOU GOT ALMOST NOTHING!
[0:06:39] <binkarus> As long as you have 0 towns, the darkling is *VERY* worth it
[0:06:41] <%Solidnick18> ok punchmom
[0:06:45] <binkarus> which you did at the time
[0:06:45] <%NWannabe> Ya scurred boi. You don't want no smoke, stop wooliesplaining
[0:06:50] <yeetdabsenpai69> WHAT DO YOU EVEN HAVE?!
[0:06:58] <%andrei11dr> You're still in last place
[0:06:58] <%Solidnick18> darkling helps alot
[0:07:02] <Riottrio> To be honest, its a very common mistake to not utilise the darkling on a first playthrough
[0:07:03] <Junkles> one of my first games someone wanted to see the darkling strike animation and got countered. the winner got to steal the darkling weapon which is the strongest in the game
[0:07:04] <binkarus> Loser should be forced to sincerely acknowledge the validity of Pat's theories in a 500 word essay
[0:07:11] <Riottrio> so we're being a bit hard on reggie
[0:07:14] <glaciusinfinite> GET THE MURDEROUS INTENT REGGIE
[0:07:16] <jevichrono> he has a town or 2
[0:07:18] <+nintega010> Yea, but now you're. Really behind
[0:07:21] <KngMatthias> When does the Salt party start lmaoooo LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL
[0:07:29] <+Kduff89> we getting real?
[0:07:33] <+kekkerscrew> This early in the game, leveling the playing field is not really very important. Remember you only now just started leaving the first continent.
[0:07:51] <%andrei11dr> I think Woolie has the least towns actually
[0:07:57] <moonologist> Mix-up is still in play
[0:08:01] <@Solidus_113> we good
[0:08:02] <Junkles> @kekkerscrew this
[0:08:05] <jevichrono> Minh is Akuma, Reggie is Dan, Woolie is Ryu
[0:08:07] <sexdrugsvideogames> we're back!
[0:08:09] <Junkles> dokapon has so many swings
[0:08:11] <Riottrio> @kekkerscrew its early game, so losing everything to catch up is definitely worth it, because you ultimately are in a position where what you have is effectively worthless
[0:08:12] <%Solidnick18> just gotta take a little risk
[0:08:13] <yeetdabsenpai69> @andrei11dr he has more than 1
[0:08:15] <binkarus> Maybe it's just me, but no matter how deep in the lead I was, I would still vote for chaos everytime
[0:08:18] <%Livelinne> lomHonk lomHonk lomHonk
[0:08:19] <binkarus> Chaos > winning
[0:08:19] <%Solidnick18> all in good salt
[0:08:21] <%andrei11dr> it's good now

[0:12:38] <+Amaideus> Seems like it was halfassing it that made it backfire
[0:12:44] <binkarus> The king hands out massive cities
[0:12:45] <%rubbishbinge> he woulda gotten 160k or so

[0:18:28] <binkarus> His parents made a mistake naming him Death Cloud. Should've gone for "hug cloud" so they could lull more players in
[0:18:30] <%neraren> You arent winning, you gotta risk it
[0:18:30] <RacistWakka> who's in the lead?
[0:18:42] <%GenesisKnight> Minh
[0:18:42] <sexdrugsvideogames> someone once said you gotta risk it to win...
[0:18:48] <nachohangovers> Don't bother with going into caves or dungeons unless prompted by the game. Or you want to got to the Casino Cave.
[0:18:48] <+Gespens> Minh by a mile
[0:18:48] <Riottrio> Minh, but they shouldn't pay too much attention this early on
[0:18:50] <djazo> use tje healing item
[0:18:54] <+gutlesscoward> minh has like triple the net worth of everyone else
[0:18:54] <crimsonsaens> You can get better equipment in the cave
[0:18:57] <%andrei11dr> It's good idea for Reggie though
[0:19:01] <flyingtentaclemonster> You heal over time though?
[0:19:16] <RacistWakka> oh boy I cant imagine the salt.
[0:19:39] <RurouniGeo> you didn't grind in the other cave woolie those enemies were trash
[0:19:39] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> You ground in a low lvl area though
[0:19:42] <%Th3SmartAlec> Weren't you chasing a rabbit and NOT grinding?
[0:19:45] <sexdrugsvideogames> Reggie, you got nothing to loose tho
[0:19:51] <crimsonsaens> You need to grind to beat the town monsters though
[0:19:51] <TheArrow_> you know what gives xp? murder
[0:19:53] <binkarus> Yeah you gotta grind in a high lvl area
[0:19:55] <RurouniGeo> you grind in the cave in chapter 1 not chapter 3 like you were doing holy crap man
[0:19:55] <Riottrio> its funny, because if reggie became darkling and hoarded his points, all of Minh's monetary lead could be gone
[0:19:57] <yeetdabsenpai69> won't work
[0:20:01] <NeroInfinite> OOOF
[0:20:01] <@Solidus_113> LUL

[0:20:19] <casualcthulhu11> that actually helped tho

[0:20:20] <+Amaideus> That was so blatant
[0:20:21] <+b_aleph> salt rises

[0:20:36] <sexdrugsvideogames> big monstar
[0:20:36] <Rayduoz> Yes sbo him more
[0:20:37] <%jiggy_snipe> Reggie prolonged the bug by buying items and stuff lol

[0:28:47] <@Solidus_113> Minh is on a quest to become a Ninja
[0:28:48] <+paladinstarbuster> @Riottrio true
[0:28:49] <%Solidnick18> Well he was the racist
[0:28:49] <yeetdabsenpai69> equipment
[0:28:51] <RurouniGeo> Minh's level 6 town taken away hurts him way more than taking his weapon but that's a 1/12 chance so taking the weapon is the most stable choice
[0:28:59] <royb2> if you take his weapon and keep stomping him you'll get more wins
[0:29:00] <reonome> TAKE HIS CASH
[0:29:00] <moonologist> he wont have the money tho
[0:29:09] <sexdrugsvideogames> cash
[0:29:13] <crimsonsaens> Trident is better
[0:29:14] <Riottrio> @paladinstarbuster I'd go for them over town, but Town wouldn't be a bad choice, especially if Reggie is never going Darkling
[0:29:19] <alephalpha> taking weapons means he's easier to kill
[0:29:21] <+Amaideus> Taking his weapon will just force him to go buy a new one
[0:29:23] <+gutlesscoward> T O W N
[0:29:24] <moonologist> Trident is worth 31k
[0:29:25] <%MaddyCaddy> Take his town

[0:29:31] <%jiggy_snipe> no weapons means easier to kill til he get a new weapon
[0:29:32] <binkarus> Defang him
[0:29:33] <TheArrow_> even a taking a small town is okay i think
[0:29:37] <+Amaideus> And Woolie's not gonna keep hunting him down to beat him into the ground
[0:29:38] <Junkles> have to collect taxes from towns
[0:29:39] <+gutlesscoward> town or gloves
[0:29:41] <LeafarOz> woolieOMG PJSalt
[0:29:42] <yeetdabsenpai69> equipment so you get stronger
[0:29:42] <RurouniGeo> taking weapon is the stable choice taking town is a gamble
[0:29:43] <+Pookiedaexzile> Take a TOWN
[0:29:47] <sexdrugsvideogames> give him bad advice, reggie
[0:29:48] <%MaddyCaddy> Cut his source of income, like that makes the most sense
[0:29:49] <%Solidnick18> i would say the gloves
[0:29:49] <Idon__> Woolie, just take what you like this is too much thinking
[0:29:49] <patrickIy> Take the Trident
[0:29:49] <+paladinstarbuster> take them gloves
[0:29:53] <+b_aleph> gloves
[0:29:53] <Riottrio> You can take trident, then throw it away
[0:29:53] <crimsonsaens> I'd take a town
[0:29:54] <flyingtentaclemonster> Take his shield which is very expensive and helps you?
[0:29:54] <ReelDeath> town is best me thinks
[0:29:57] <+Amaideus> Definitely take the gloves
[0:29:57] <%jiggy_snipe> no you can throw it in the trash

[0:31:03] <%andrei11dr> JUST FUCKING DO SOMETHING ALREADY
[0:31:05] <flyingtentaclemonster> MINH [FINAL]
[0:31:11] <+agumon9000> That's 11 more attack
[0:31:12] <Sgww> woolieWUT
[0:31:14] <yeetdabsenpai69> cleric is warrior based
[0:31:16] <Riottrio> @Goat_Baka I skipped ahead in the manga, but I'm totally going back afterwards. having face-cam is so worth it
[0:31:20] <%MaddyCaddy> That seemed like a dumb move
[0:31:27] <binkarus> That was a fine move
[0:31:28] <yeetdabsenpai69> trident is warrtir based!
[0:31:34] <crimsonsaens> Cleric is not wrrior based
[0:31:35] <+Amaideus> The gloves was definitely the right choice
[0:31:35] <gunsrlove> Furious Vengeance ruined by overthinking
[0:31:36] <%neraren> Correct
[0:31:43] <%jiggy_snipe> damage not attack so it won't show
[0:31:47] <+Amaideus> Hard to get back, nerfs him "permanently", buffs yourself
[0:31:48] <%andrei11dr> Minh is like a couple of spaces away from buying a new weapon
[0:31:49] <JetpackMcQuack> 3 Kreygasm
[0:31:54] <RurouniGeo> @MaddyCaddy tossing the weapon is a hurt to the player 100%. taking a level 6 town hurts more but that is random
[0:31:55] <LeafarOz> woolieOMG PJSalt
[0:31:59] <Riottrio> Trident still isn't a terrible choice. it could take Minh many MANY turns to land on the weapon shop
[0:31:59] <royb2> now attack him again
[0:32:00] <+Pookiedaexzile> Woolie thinks he's a strategist
[0:32:09] <binkarus> @WoolieVersus There's this concept in chess called "tempo" which is similar to initiative. By taking his trident, he has to waste time getting another weapon, which means you've gained tempo.
[0:32:09] <+gutlesscoward> oh wow

[0:32:11] <moonologist> USE IT

[0:40:55] <blink289> embrace the darkness
[0:40:59] <JetpackMcQuack> Winner
[0:41:01] <NeroInfinite> It just blocks movement
[0:41:04] <+Amaideus> It drops a block you can't walk onto/past
[0:41:04] <Goat_Baka> History does favor the brave too, but mostly the bold
[0:41:05] <Riottrio> @binkarus spawns a big rock that blocks a space. Super niche in terms of use
[0:41:06] <%MaddyCaddy> Camp Minh's spawn
[0:41:11] <DaBigVitus> @Riottrio oh wow, then I'm out. don't want to spoil myself. enjoy, all!
[0:41:12] <+Amaideus> There's no way
[0:41:12] <nachohangovers> lol power poke
[0:41:13] <crimsonsaens> If only there was a magician
[0:41:13] <sexdrugsvideogames> oh, thats no problem for you, woolie
[0:41:19] <%neraren> Just 135 attack
[0:41:20] <NeroInfinite> 135 AT

[0:41:21] <binkarus> @Riottrio grazzi
[0:41:21] <alephalpha> why haven't they bought defensive magic actually?
[0:41:22] <RacistWakka> go for it! bruh
[0:41:25] <yeetdabsenpai69> @binkarus can' pass it on the board
[0:41:26] <%RioGascar> Drop a block in minhs path

[0:41:31] <flyingtentaclemonster> 2 in a row?
[0:41:31] <+Amaideus> And takes more than 2 hits to kill unless you strike
[0:41:34] <+agumon9000> They underestimate how fucking busted magic is late game
[0:41:35] <Drunkengen> Magic his ass
[0:41:36] <binkarus> Maybe if he actually uses a buff before going into the fight he could take him
[0:41:37] <monster343> 6 sp tho
[0:41:40] <%Jetzord> lock Woolie into the town
[0:41:40] <binkarus> Use charge then fight
[0:41:42] <Riottrio> @alephalpha They don't know how helpful it would be I guess

[0:42:28] <Riottrio> they always hit a new continent and go "wow, I need to grind", then two turns later are striking bosses hoping for the best
[0:42:30] <moonologist> attack
[0:42:31] <%andrei11dr> STRIKE
[0:42:31] <+Amaideus> It has to be 2 strikes to kill before it kills you
[0:42:32] <yeetdabsenpai69> your not beating it with what you got
[0:42:35] <Drunkengen> Magic dat ass bou

[0:44:05] <+Amaideus> Oh, that block doesn't work the way I thought it did
[0:44:10] <alephalpha> why does reggie refuse to gain power with mix up
[0:44:12] <Riottrio> @aeonicvector not in this game. Defense only protects 1.4hp per point, so 10HP is way more powerful, and let your defense rise naturally from shiels
[0:44:14] <Daba_mk2> do it

[0:45:45] <krymzen5> don't make eye contact LUL
[0:45:48] <binkarus> Time for woolie to take it
[0:45:53] <+kekkerscrew> Yeah Keep Walkin
[0:45:54] <+LegendaryDorkKnight> Imagine not playing FF7 right now
[0:46:02] <binkarus> 1hitko
[0:46:05] <sexdrugsvideogames> is this the comeback?
[0:46:07] <yeetdabsenpai69> reggie PLEASE level or go darkling so you CAN leel?
[0:46:09] <%RioGascar> Imagine not playing DOKAPON RIGHT NOW
[0:46:10] <aeonicvector> @Riottrio correct, but maximum hp dosent take any natrual buffs, whereas defense, while only 1.4 per, can benefit from effects to increase it such as consumables, and arent ignored by later game options save those that utterly ignore (such as Powerpoke)
[0:46:21] <+agumon9000> You had the crystal!
[0:46:22] <flyingtentaclemonster> Yo Woolie's so stronk now!
[0:46:28] <Riottrio> @LegendaryDorkKnight I got the game really early. i'm still not done, but I will delay beating it for dokapon content
[0:46:28] <binkarus> @agumon9000 lol
[0:46:30] <Xeno351> Imagine not knowing what nomura is doing to FF7
[0:46:33] <jevichrono> You had the Mix Up
[0:46:36] <%Livelinne> Woow
[0:46:41] <Zayasu> SO EIN MIST
[0:46:42] <Goat_Baka> Perfect 3 Spinner
[0:46:42] <KngMatthias> BibleThump BibleThump
[0:46:43] <aeonicvector> ergo, if your focused on regen, you pour into defense early, then pump that hp naturally since your in the cleric line
[0:46:45] <%twilight_cleric> go to town area
[0:46:54] <kingkeldeo31> just land on the blank space
[0:46:54] <%twilight_cleric> three up for grabs
[0:47:02] <crimsonsaens> Go to towns
[0:47:13] <NeroInfinite> The block stops you
[0:47:15] <crimsonsaens> Improve your advantage
[0:47:23] <+agumon9000> Stay away from the summoner!
[0:47:51] <metalwater8> why don't they take the towns?

[0:48:26] <+agumon9000> ??????
[0:48:31] <royb2> I sense bitch
[0:48:32] <Riottrio> @aeonicvector While i agree about the buffs making defense more useable in certain situations, Powerpoke is just as unaffected by defense as HP. And if you have more HP, you'll still have more HP left after being hit by moves like power poke.
[0:48:34] <Klefth> What a bitch

[0:56:34] <binkarus> Oh wait he has mad speed
[0:56:54] <Gramcracker55> the magic stat has nothing to do with field magic accuracy, only speed does.
[0:57:00] <htimssamoht> Buy a Vanish and ROB HER
[0:57:04] <Xeno351> he's invible so they can't attack him back so they die for sure

[1:27:28] <htimssamoht> No, go for the objective
[1:27:29] <Idon__> MAXIMUM COWARDICE
[1:27:29] <SethKyu> Escape only works on his turn, tho
[1:27:30] <NeroInfinite> you need that temple Reggie

[1:27:34] <crimsonsaens> Can't he give up against Woolie too, for perfect defense?
[1:27:35] <htimssamoht> 5 Money tricksters, Reggie!
[1:27:36] <elrey745> !uptime
[1:27:37] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 31 minutes
[1:27:37] <Riottrio> while this bounty hunt goes om, he can catch up
[1:27:38] <%ekodrop> seriously reggie...
[1:27:39] <RurouniGeo> this is why Reggie is in last place lol
[1:27:50] <glaciusinfinite> Take this time to catch up Reggie
[1:27:59] <Riottrio> or turn darling and drag them down to his level
[1:28:00] <kingkeldeo31> It's now or never
[1:28:02] <%andrei11dr> I don't think any of you are heroes
[1:28:04] <%GeneralSCPatton> Heroes tactically advance in the opposite direction of danger
[1:28:04] <$SilverRoddo> Heroes set up to backdown
[1:28:04] <%jiggy_snipe> I guess if Reggie clears towns while these two are screwing around
[1:28:06] <+pectusumbra> If reggie just uses magic on monsters to even the odds he can start getting a nice town lead
[1:28:08] <%neraren> Go big Woolz
[1:28:09] <%GenesisKnight> SPINNER
[1:28:11] <Xeno351> reggie is in last place almost solely on his decision to be fair

[1:30:11] <Riottrio> ong Minh big brain plays
[1:30:16] <htimssamoht> Can't move yourself!
[1:30:16] <@Solidus_113> Minh that's not for you
[1:30:17] <TigerClaws12> BIG BRAIN?
[1:30:18] <Xeno351> you have to select woolie first
[1:30:20] <+agumon9000> You have to select the target
[1:30:21] <reonome> pick the player first minh
[1:30:22] <Gramcracker55> You select the target first
[1:30:28] <therealtacopancakes> skyBruh

[1:30:32] <Riottrio> no use it properly Minh
[1:30:32] <%neraren> Pick the square first
[1:30:32] <NeroInfinite> He has to select someone first
[1:30:38] <$SilverRoddo> Heel move, Minh puts all the heat on himself.
[1:30:39] <+Amaideus> That's unintuitive
[1:30:43] <binkarus> Thinking is a crime here
[1:30:43] <+A0N33> If Reggie were in here this would have been the biggest brain plays LUL
[1:30:45] <%GeneralSCPatton> yeah, this is smol brain time

[1:30:55] <TheArrow_> dangerously close to doing something cool
[1:30:57] <+agumon9000> Mihn didn't even try
[1:30:59] <Riottrio> big brain moment to small brain play
[1:31:01] <glaciusinfinite> Select a person brainius
[1:31:02] <%rubbishbinge> on the green tho
[1:31:04] <+Amaideus> I know why he didn't do it
[1:31:05] <%jiggy_snipe> check it
[1:31:06] <%andrei11dr> @woolieversus You need to select the target first
[1:31:06] <+dollarstored> if reggie went into the cave
[1:31:10] <Ralfclogs> Rip Mihn
[1:31:11] <+dollarstored> it woulda been perfect
[1:31:12] <+Amaideus> He tried to move himself the first time
[1:31:13] <NeroInfinite> YOU're VERY good
[1:31:13] <%xeromage> When your enemy advances, you withdraw. Minh knows the Art of War
[1:31:14] <+Grayhammatter> you're good
[1:31:15] <binkarus> You can't expect a mouse to solve a maze built for a human
[1:31:15] <TigerClaws12> you're fine
[1:31:15] <htimssamoht> Reggie, anybody can get towns, but THIS IS YOUR ONLY CHANCE TO GET THIS CASTLE
[1:31:16] <+Amaideus> But it doesn't let you do that

[2:05:02] <nothuzad> minh shutting it down hard :D
[2:05:09] <RurouniGeo> yes the caves are good don't be afraid of them
[2:05:10] <htimssamoht> You had tricksters in Asianna, the first continent.
[2:05:10] <zenith0111> You're better off playing it like a board game and just commit to a direction rather than just walk back and forth like you guys have been doing.
[2:05:11] <+Grayhammatter> fair
[2:05:12] <Riottrio> Reggie's best bet would be to stay in that loop
[2:05:18] <Idon__> Minh is untouchable
[2:05:22] <Riottrio> that way he can roll two numbers and land on the shop rather than 1
[2:05:23] <zenith0111> Wasted so many turns doing that.
[2:05:26] <crimsonsaens> You cannot buy Tricksters except at that store
[2:05:30] <%GenesisKnight> You need AoE's to hurt Minh
[2:05:34] <sexdrugsvideogames> go to the cave
