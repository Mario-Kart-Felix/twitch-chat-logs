[0:18:20] <Darren716> Oh wait I thought it was bandaged at first LUL
[0:18:21] <andre11dr> Just don't mash that hard

[0:18:41] <DianaTheAscian> the d pad cuts in sometimes
[0:18:43] <%Lion_kun> READ MY DONOS PROPERLY WOOLZ I SAID V GUNDAM
[0:18:43] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> woolieLORE
[0:18:50] <CaptainBright> oh yeah I play pad like woolie does as well
[0:18:52] <darkfilled> their just buttons tho lol
[0:18:53] <%HitchhikingThrough> OK but like maybe if you do this to your hand the control scheme could stand to be improved.
[0:18:53] <+Undenizen> how big is your hand woolie? I have tiny hands and use the tips
[0:18:57] <mandjelo> You use the joint/fat. Who the fuck uses the tip?
[0:18:58] <%Chatterbox1991> The Joint :)
[0:19:10] <%Noonoox12> @Undenizen he's got big hands
[0:19:32] <smyld> Heh dp
[0:19:37] <darkfilled> controllers are now being osha approved?
[0:19:40] <%ChoculaUltra> large hands
[0:19:42] <%HitchhikingThrough> Plague is right, the quarter-circle needs to die.
[0:19:50] <OblivionSword1> Huh it is easier
[0:20:08] <TheChapyGuy> I tore my thumb up using a dpad. arcade stick solved the issues for me
[0:20:12] <andre11dr> KOF is even harder
[0:20:16] <Equirah> That's a thick finger only feature
[0:20:16] <CaptainBright> fuck doing raging storm movements with pad
[0:20:20] <mandjelo> I think pad only sucks if you're using characters with whole circle commands. Otherwise, it's aight.
[0:20:21] <%ChoculaUltra> I always wondered how the community would feel if more Japanese fighting games had the accessibility/input shortening accessibility of say the MK games
[0:20:27] <Zebroneath> Wait, right themb on the d-pad?
[0:20:35] <redrins> his loops can be brutal on your thumb if you do them a lot
[0:20:39] <+Jiggisnipe> I personally don't like playing charge characters on pad
[0:20:42] <Dabrikishaw> Honestly I should find time to seriously watch the UC Gundam shows
[0:20:49] <CaptainBright> @Zebroneath his video source is inverted
[0:21:02] <Prevot> @zebroneath woolie is living in the mirror world
[0:21:07] <andre11dr> Well 11 doesn't ask you to do HD combos, that's the shit that fucks your hands
[0:21:15] <Zebroneath> OH, right, ty
[0:21:19] <kamenspidey> woolie is the man in the mirror
[0:21:21] <%MaximumDaximum> reminds me of doing Painwheel flight cancel combos
[0:21:33] <%MaximumDaximum> sounds worse though
[0:21:53] <%ChoculaUltra> legit waiting for the day I can just replace these stupid human hands with unfeeling robot hands with 0 joint pain FeelsBadMan
[0:21:55] <+Dr_DangerPhD> I play Nago on stick but I can def see how it could cause some pain
[0:22:49] <TheChapyGuy> Nago is rough with the inputs. I really started falling in love with him though
[0:22:49] <+Pugweight> i felt like that playing Kyo, had to switch to stick
[0:22:54] <+chase959> is that a splint or a cast?
[0:22:54] <Pookiedaexzile> Wheres Hitbox to save us
[0:22:58] <$QueequegTheater> QueequegTheater subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months! Based on his playstyle, I can't wait for Reggie to absolutely throatfuck Bloodborne
[0:23:12] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @ChoculUltra id be so much better at DMC lol
[0:23:17] <%HitchhikingThrough> I honestly think you could come up with a better control scheme for gamepads with modern fighting games
[0:23:24] <$QueequegTheater> I like that word. Got a lotta oomph to it
[0:23:42] <%ChoculaUltra> @abelincoln_catpuncher dude I'm still feeling the consequences of trying to Guard Fly in DMC4SE years later LUL
[0:23:43] <darkfilled> i hope reggie versus other souls games.
[0:23:51] <%HitchhikingThrough> Command inputs dedicated on the left stick, movements on the dpad, then simplify the command inputs maybe
[0:23:59] <%gatorafan> I wish I was a cool robot MrDestructoid
[0:24:04] <%ThisIsLloyd> you ever look into medical tape? is got great friction and is made to stick to skin
[0:24:07] <%HitchhikingThrough> So QCF forward gets translated to left stick forward
[0:24:08] <%Josef_Stryker> LUL
[0:24:08] <verscoll> LUL
[0:24:09] <$QueequegTheater> Alternatively, I would like Reggie VS Hollow Knight
[0:24:13] <%X2Eliah> LUL
[0:24:14] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[0:24:18] <YakumoYomi> LUL
[0:24:23] <+TheotherKristian> Reggie VS Souls
[0:24:24] <%HitchhikingThrough> @QueequegTheater NGL would want to see that
[0:24:30] <%X2Eliah> Hey, whatever works
[0:24:42] <%X2Eliah> And that half glove looks anime as hell
[0:24:43] <Lancaster_H> @QueequegTheater oh good god a woolievs hollow knight LP would last at least a decade dont
[0:24:44] <darkfilled> yeah reggie vs souls
[0:24:56] <+TheotherKristian> Blood Souls is a better name than SoulsBorne, SoulsBorne sound no good
[0:24:56] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:25:08] <%ChoculaUltra> people like to clown on Smash, but there's a reason why it's so huge. Ease of input/accessibility is a huge part of people not afraid to try the game out
[0:25:09] <$QueequegTheater> No, Blood Souls is dumb
[0:25:14] <$QueequegTheater> SoulsBorne is better
[0:25:17] <%zanzibar_junker> The 3DS fucked my hand
[0:25:22] <Prevot> reminder to never, ever, play kid icarus uprising
[0:25:25] <+mechslayer71> @queequegtheater for sure
[0:25:28] <$QueequegTheater> The 3DS killed my mother
[0:25:40] <DianaTheAscian> The 3DS
[0:25:40] <+ALazo> This whole looking for solutions is a bit funny to me when my solution to this kind of problem is usually to keep going until I bleed and hope calluses form eventually
[0:25:43] <darkfilled> souls came before blood, so soulsborne.
[0:25:45] <%HitchhikingThrough> @Prevot Playing it on the PC is the only healthy way
[0:25:46] <+TheotherKristian> 3DS stole my car!
[0:25:51] <andre11dr> The 3DS fucked my wife
[0:25:56] <+mechslayer71> God a Bloodborne remake would be fantastic
[0:25:59] <%dreadedcthulhu> I've found it's a lot easier for me to avoid hurting my hands on pad when I started holding my controller looser
[0:25:59] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> if you draw, and are right handed, you can draw a lot AND play fighting games with a stick to fuck up BOTH hands
[0:26:14] <%gatorafan> Reggie becomes a hitbox warrior
[0:26:14] <$QueequegTheater> @mechslayer71 But why
[0:26:17] <DianaTheAscian> The 3DS killed my family...family...family...
[0:26:17] <darkfilled> i would rather a bloodborne 2.
[0:26:21] <glass_marcus> The 3DS left me at the alter
[0:26:25] <%Noonoox12> @mechslayer71 no need. 60FPS patch is all that game needs
[0:26:27] <$QueequegTheater> I would rather an actual sequel to DS2
[0:26:30] <DeathByPoke7> yeah mash that shit out
[0:26:34] <%ChoculaUltra> they announced Days Gone was hitting PC later this year with more Sony shit to come. Everyone's got their fingers crossed for a Bloodborne PC port with 60 fps
[0:26:45] <Ace_Flibble> Bloodborne prequel: like MGS3, about Lady Maria
[0:26:47] <%krispen_wa> The 3DS likes Gundam SEED
[0:26:50] <+mechslayer71> @noonoox12 @queequegtheater I honestly think a remake would be more likely than a patch at this point
[0:26:54] <Prevot> why the hell would you want more DS2
[0:27:05] <+mechslayer71> Also, that game could use some visual touching up
[0:27:07] <Prevot> DS2 is already too much DS2
[0:27:12] <$QueequegTheater> Because it's better than the other Souls games, obviously
[0:27:12] <+ThirdofOne> tekken is dial-a-combo
[0:27:13] <%Noonoox12> @mechslayer71 .... whyyyy??? It's only like 5 years old
[0:27:15] <%zanzibar_junker> The 3DS likes Seed Destiny
[0:27:28] <$QueequegTheater> The 3DS invented pineapple pizza
[0:27:38] <+TheotherKristian> Which would come first, BloodBorne 60fps patch or Bluepoint remake?
[0:27:38] <andre11dr> @queequegtheater I really hope your trolling
[0:27:46] <DianaTheAscian> The 3DS like Mega Man X7
[0:27:48] <darkfilled> it's not my fav, but i do miss ds2 the most because it's diff.
[0:27:51] <DianaTheAscian> liked*
[0:28:02] <%JustYudha> But pineapple pizza is good tho
[0:28:09] <$QueequegTheater> @JustYudha wrong
[0:28:11] <%krispen_wa> God, I'm still waiting for that dude to release that DkS2 lighting mod
[0:28:16] <+TheotherKristian> Pineapple pizza is good
[0:28:22] <%Noonoox12> @TheotherKristian BB already has a mod for 60fps, so that seems much more likely
[0:28:23] <%krispen_wa> but he got distracted trying to actually overhaul the game mechanics
[0:28:24] <+mechslayer71> You played it recently? I mean, art and environment design is still good but I feel all the souls game are visually dated when they come out @noonoox13
[0:28:30] <+mechslayer71> @noonoox12
[0:28:32] <%Javaa01> Just churn that butter
[0:28:32] <DianaTheAscian> Pineapple pizza is just okay
[0:28:34] <Prevot> imagine a bloodborne remake that ruins a bunch of designs...
[0:28:44] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[0:28:44] <%zanzibar_junker> But yeah I try to avoid claw controller holding now.
[0:28:47] <BlackermanZX> good ol' git gud
[0:28:48] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[0:28:49] <%Noonoox12> @mechslayer71 big disagree. Sorry
[0:28:54] <%gatorafan> people who fear the pineapple have not gone deep enough on the pizzahole InuyoFace
[0:29:05] <%DiscoMatador> The 3DS made my dad go out for smokes
[0:29:07] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> the 3DS convinced Capcom DMC4 didnt sell enough
[0:29:15] <$QueequegTheater> Curse you automod
[0:29:15] <Tydemore> asti de woolie
[0:29:21] <%gatorafan> the true horror lies bellow
[0:29:25] <benjifish345> The 3DS spawned Pat
[0:29:26] <+mechslayer71> @prevot never said Bluepoint Kappa
[0:29:29] <%zanzibar_junker> the middle right and ring fingers still are sorta twisted from the carpal tunnel
[0:29:35] <darkfilled> i just hold a controller however.
[0:29:36] <%KiwamiKiryu> Terrarp subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! 6 months! Thanks for making the pandemic bearable boys! Much love from México
[0:29:37] <BlackermanZX> the 3DS killed MM Legends 3
[0:29:42] <%ChoculaUltra> reminder that DMC4SE came out almost an entire decade after the og DMC4. Has nothing to do with anything but I always find it hilarious LUL
[0:29:44] <DianaTheAscian> The 3DS made Omikron
[0:29:46] <%krispen_wa> The 3DS was the Nintendo 3DS
[0:29:47] <+TheotherKristian> the 3DS is banning a Mother 3 port
[0:29:59] <$QueequegTheater> The 3DS gave David Cage the idea to get into filmmaking
[0:30:03] <DianaTheAscian> The 3DS killed bayo 3
[0:30:24] <Tydemore> Woolie knows how precise my May is alkJergens alkJergens
[0:30:28] <andre11dr> DS2 has the weakest level design has the most trash boss fights in the game, a world map that actually makes no sense, a lot of dumb lore that goes nowhere because "shit is forgotten yo" ,the worst final boss both of them
[0:30:33] <glass_marcus> The 3DS forgot the cookies
[0:30:35] <andre11dr> Am i missing anything
[0:30:37] <benjifish345> The 3DS gave Dan an infinite
[0:30:40] <Ace_Flibble> I appreciate when fighting games don't punish a player for being ''enthusiastic'' with their inputs, as long as the input is correct and they're not hitting totally wrong buttons.
[0:30:41] <%krispen_wa> its also the funnest to multiplayer
[0:30:44] <andre11dr> Oh yeah, trash mpcs
[0:30:45] <Prevot> man even if all those things were literally true the 3ds would still be way better than the vita LUL
[0:30:48] <+mechslayer71> @andre11dr probably LUL LUL LUL
[0:30:59] <%zanzibar_junker> a lot people have infinites
[0:31:00] <%Chatterbox1991> "I'm just gonna be real with you" :|
[0:31:03] <+mechslayer71> But yeah, those bosses are laughably bad
[0:31:04] <DianaTheAscian> oh ds2 means Dark souls 2
[0:31:20] <%Noonoox12> thloat fruck
[0:31:23] <%krispen_wa> The 3DS made the Vita
[0:31:25] <DianaTheAscian> I thought people were taliking about a nintendo ds2
[0:31:34] <Tydemore> Demon's Souls HYPU
[0:31:34] <DeathByPoke7> WutFace
[0:31:40] <darkfilled> reggie has better english than me, but im american so.
[0:31:41] <dundore77> good timing on the feed switch
[0:31:47] <+mechslayer71> Wonder how Reggie gonna deal with that FPS on Bloodborne tho....
[0:31:55] <+TheotherKristian> the 3DS approved the Mass Effect 3 ending
[0:32:17] <%zanzibar_junker> The 3DS likes oily peanut butter
[0:32:17] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:32:19] <$QueequegTheater> @andre11dr 1. opinion, 2. also has the most good fights, 3. so what, who cares, 4. so the same as DS1 and 3 then, and 5. SoC is the worst final boss by a mile, it's literally recycled player movesets and a recycled final boss in a recycled arena with recycled music
[0:32:24] <theuncrownedruler> What game is this?
[0:32:25] <%MaximumDaximum> @mechslayer71 isn't Bloodborne a consistent 30 fps if it's on PS5?
[0:32:39] <%krispen_wa> lmao thinking SoC is worse than fucking Nashandra
[0:32:41] <+mechslayer71> @maximumdaximum that’s.... not great nowadays
[0:32:46] <%DiscoMatador> The 3DS made Silent Hill Homecoming
[0:32:49] <DianaTheAscian> The 3DS enjoyed Anthem
[0:32:57] <+mechslayer71> But yes it is
[0:33:02] <%Seancicle> woolieSHOOK FootYellow
[0:33:06] <%krispen_wa> The 3DS made Dark Souls 2
[0:33:07] <benjifish345> The 3DS caused Nintendo to fuck Melee
[0:33:08] <%MaximumDaximum> @mechslayer71 true, but I feel like a consistent 30 is perfectly playable.
[0:33:17] <+TheotherKristian> the 3DS fired Hideo Kojima
[0:33:29] <$QueequegTheater> @krispen_wa Aldia, not Nashandra. But at least Nash was actually acknowledged by the story instead of being blatant nostalgia-bait dropped in at the end
[0:33:32] <Prevot> @benjifish345 I thought we were listing bad things?
[0:33:34] <darkfilled> is this game even worth getting, it looks too easy for a souls game?
[0:33:37] <prime_name> the 3DS canceled Scalebound
[0:33:38] <DianaTheAscian> The 3DS thinks Gundam zz was better than Zeta
[0:33:41] <+mechslayer71> Playable yeah @maximumdaximum but all of reggies souls experience has been this game, which runs 60 consistently
[0:33:49] <%Dirty_Dandere> Didn't the 3DS make Konami?
[0:33:53] <%Seancicle> ExtraLife
[0:33:54] <$QueequegTheater> The 3DS gave Paul Anderson a career
[0:34:05] <+mechslayer71> @darkfilled it’s def the easiest one
[0:34:11] <+TheotherKristian> the 3DS made the Kinect
[0:34:18] <%zanzibar_junker> I like the Zeon mechs in ZZ than Z
[0:34:18] <%DiscoMatador> The 3DS bullys Vtubers
[0:34:20] <%krispen_wa> imagine thinking SoC is worse than "run around and attack him when he's not on fire" Aldia
[0:34:22] <darkfilled> that's wat worries me.
[0:34:25] <Applecannon63> the3DS killed the Vita
[0:34:29] <whiteblacklight74> quality
[0:34:40] <andre11dr> Now don't get me wrong, DS2 does have a lot of built diversity, some of my favorite buids are in DS2 ,and there's some godlike weapons and fashion
[0:34:40] <$QueequegTheater> @krispen_wa Aldia has his own moveset
[0:34:40] <BlackermanZX> nah actually the vita killed itself
[0:34:41] <whiteblacklight74> test it on patches
[0:34:41] <Ace_Flibble> the 3DS put Gems in SFxT
[0:34:42] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> "so I've been grinding offscreen"
[0:34:44] <$QueequegTheater> SoC doesn't
[0:34:45] <+cvp5127> @Applecannon63 no sony did
[0:34:52] <prime_name> The 3DS doxes its favorite content creators
[0:34:52] <%krispen_wa> Yeah and his moveset is ass
[0:35:01] <%DegenCat> Friendship ended with Crescent Falchion. Quality Kilij is my new best friend.
[0:35:02] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> wow a wiggling png
[0:35:02] <$QueequegTheater> Nah
[0:35:06] <%X2Eliah> yeeeeah
[0:35:07] <+mechslayer71> Liam tried to revive the vita to no avail
[0:35:07] <%krispen_wa> SoC's moveset is actually fun to fight
[0:35:09] <%zanzibar_junker> Oh wow
[0:35:19] <$QueequegTheater> Because it's not his moveset
[0:35:20] <%Seancicle> TwitchSings woolieOMG_TK
[0:35:24] <DianaTheAscian> The 3DS made SAO
[0:35:29] <Ace_Flibble> giving me big 2000s fractal wallpaper vibes
[0:35:31] <%hax_metatron> But they changed the meaning of what these blobs were. They had more of a "water" feel in the original because it was directly related to Shadow Tower: Abyss in development. Now it looks more like Souls. It's a fine change, but misses some intention
[0:35:33] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus spyAce
[0:35:48] <%krispen_wa> "There's no rule that an imitation can't surpass the original" - Some dude who doesnt die when killed
[0:35:51] <$QueequegTheater> The 3DS knowingly issues false DMCA claims
[0:35:58] <Applecannon63> I though dot Hack created SAO?
[0:36:04] <$QueequegTheater> It fucking doesn't
[0:36:17] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> @hax_metatron Bluepoint? Missing the original intention? Shocked.
[0:36:27] <Applecannon63> it influenced to less degree
[0:36:36] <%A_German_spy> karacoLOL
[0:36:44] <darkfilled> souls needs proper necromancy .
[0:36:52] <%hax_metatron> @CanadianAnimatorGuy It doesn't bother me too much but it's just a response to "it didn't look as good in the original". The original had intention behind choices, it wasn't half baked or limited in a big way
[0:37:09] <whiteblacklight74> there's no number, but there is a gauge
[0:37:12] <%krispen_wa> i actually play DkS2 more than all of the other games but even I can admit the final bosses are the fucking worst
[0:37:15] <$QueequegTheater> Woolie how dare you, Firebomb addiction is an epidemic
[0:37:20] <%zanzibar_junker> Smoke em if you got em
[0:37:39] <%Seancicle> reliance develops to dependence
[0:37:43] <%JelliesBloom> JelliesBloom subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! hey guys, don't know if either of you have said it before or have decided, but will Reggie be trying out the other soul titles?
[0:37:47] <pmda2126> used on BK skeleton
[0:37:54] <LunarRemix> Have consumables ever been good in any souls game?
[0:38:02] <%patriotrenegade> Barely
[0:38:02] <andre11dr> Ah yes, we were doing 1-3
[0:38:10] <%A_German_spy> @LunarRemix Some have
[0:38:16] <pmda2126> I like dung pies
[0:38:19] <%zanzibar_junker> It's great in Nioh 1 and 2
[0:38:20] <%A_German_spy> @LunarRemix Dark moon grass, Elizabeth's Mushrooms...
[0:38:22] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Helpful, but never overpowered
[0:38:26] <%krispen_wa> Time to watch get killed by Reggie
[0:38:28] <+freystreams> TIME TO GET PENETRATED
[0:38:31] <%krispen_wa> watch Ostrava
[0:38:32] <$QueequegTheater> since the DLCs are included in scholar for free, Burnt Ivory King is a better final boss than Gwyn, Moon Presence, or SoC
[0:38:39] <%A_German_spy> @LunarRemix Green Blossoms
[0:38:43] <%Noonoox12> here we go
[0:38:44] <+ReallyBigRocks> Let's be real, have consumables ever been good in any games?
[0:38:51] <LunarRemix> @A_German_spy Do you think these counts? They're healing items. I'm thinking of stuff like Pine Resins and Firebombs
[0:38:56] <%krispen_wa> Ivory King isnt the final boss
[0:38:58] <%zanzibar_junker> Ivory King was beautiful
[0:39:00] <%patriotrenegade> Burnt Ivory King is a huge pain to fight
[0:39:08] <%krispen_wa> You still have to fight Nashandra and Aldia after him
[0:39:11] <darkfilled> look, we all love ds2, ok?
[0:39:11] <LunarRemix> @A_German_spy I'm sorry I'm not trying to be rude, sorry if I'm coming off like that
[0:39:20] <$QueequegTheater> Yeah but you shouldn't
[0:39:20] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:39:22] <%Noonoox12> Ivory king is one of the FEW good boss designs in DkS 2, but trash to actually get to
[0:39:29] <%A_German_spy> @LunarRemix Well, you said consumables, and they're all consumables. But if you mean buff items, yeah, the pine resin items in Demon's Souls are great before you start getting spells.
[0:39:29] <andre11dr> So let's take bets, will Bjor die in the fight or nah?
[0:39:31] <+Anderobot> Resins are great if you can’t self buff and dung pies are good throwables
[0:39:35] <%Noonoox12> like everything else about DkS 2, cool idea, poor implementation
[0:39:38] <$QueequegTheater> The difficulty curve is clearly designed to have the DLCs last
[0:39:45] <@Solidus_113> There's a Return to Drangleic event happening starting Feb 27th. Load up your SOTFS copies and play
[0:39:56] <%A_German_spy> @LunarRemix And yeah, dung pies in DS1 are really useful.
[0:40:06] <%patriotrenegade> Vendrick tasks you to retreive the crowns after linking the flame and defeating nashandra right
[0:40:12] <darkfilled> chase the bro would tell you resins are great, and i would agree too.
[0:40:15] <+ReallyBigRocks> Damn, Reggie is SLICIN fools
[0:40:22] <%krispen_wa> Well I guess that means Pontiff Sulyvahn is the real final boss of DS3 if you go by your arbitrary standards
[0:40:30] <+mechslayer71> Imagine Bloodborne comes to PC and is still 30 FPS
[0:40:33] <+mechslayer71> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[0:40:38] <$QueequegTheater> What? You have to beat Sulyvahn BEFORE SoC
[0:40:42] <$QueequegTheater> 4Head
[0:40:49] <darkfilled> consumables are great for pvp.
[0:40:51] <%patriotrenegade> Sulyvahn was SUPPOSED to be the final boss
[0:41:00] <Lancaster_H> @mechslayer71 itd be fixed within hours
[0:41:01] <%A_German_spy> karacoLOL
[0:41:02] <%krispen_wa> What? you have to beat Ivory King before Nashandra and Aldia
[0:41:02] <DianaTheAscian> I'd be really funny if it was still 30fps
[0:41:05] <+ReallyBigRocks> @mechslayer71 I would cry
[0:41:10] <%Prattlesworth> This area is really pretty
[0:41:10] <pmda2126> dung pies are useful, and fun
[0:41:12] <%DegenCat> the tragedy lmao
[0:41:12] <$QueequegTheater> @krispen_wa No you don't
[0:41:17] <%patriotrenegade> And Gundyr was supposed to be Oceiros
[0:41:26] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> I can't believe the final boss of Dark Souls 3 is Midir, I had no idea
[0:41:29] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @mechslayer71 that would suck, but at least mods can fix that so could be worse. I'd honestly take 30fps over an overall bad port
[0:41:31] <%krispen_wa> this conversation is making me lose braincells
[0:41:51] <+Partialrecall2> I wonder if they've seen that Black Mirror episode yet...
[0:41:53] <%patriotrenegade> And Wolnir was supposed to be where Yhorm is
[0:41:53] <%krispen_wa> Lets just agree to disagree and agree that Im right
[0:41:53] <%Deekman> what is this conversation lmao
[0:41:58] <%X2Eliah> ?
[0:41:59] <jorniev> I did
[0:42:00] <$QueequegTheater> Oh no, if you lose too many you'll become a DS3 fan Kappa
[0:42:02] <%Deekman> lmao how could you not
[0:42:14] <%krispen_wa> I hate DS3
[0:42:15] <+ReallyBigRocks> Damn gurl, you got a sturdy box
[0:42:17] <Lancaster_H> something something lootcrate slash super
[0:42:20] <$QueequegTheater> (Really they're all good games I just like 2 the most for personal reasons)
[0:42:22] <%krispen_wa> but SoC is better than Aldia
[0:42:23] <andre11dr> Honestly the "which is the best Souls game" arguement was always stupid for me because they all have strengths and weaknesses that the other don't
[0:42:23] <mandjelo> Ah yes, crates, the sturdiest of the boxes.
[0:42:24] <+Jiggisnipe> oh yea of course
[0:42:26] <%X2Eliah> Bu have you *rolled* into a barrel?
[0:42:27] <LunarRemix> But armor tho
[0:42:28] <+MyshkaMysh> Ahhh, yeah. Some Demons Souls.
[0:42:28] <+ReallyBigRocks> Taut
[0:42:32] <%Deekman> Get in to Barrels
[0:42:34] <darkfilled> ds3 is pvp king hands down.
[0:42:36] <%A_German_spy> Yeah, it'd be you that break, not the barrel LUL
[0:42:42] <$QueequegTheater> @krispen_wa but no tho
[0:42:44] <+GuyNooN> well if youre in full plate it could work
[0:42:46] <+mechslayer71> Your character is just built different
[0:42:47] <%patriotrenegade> You ever try and break a pallet by rolling into it? Not that easy.
[0:42:57] <%krispen_wa> DS2 is best pvp if you AREN'T fighting Havelyns
[0:43:11] <darkfilled> nope
[0:43:16] <$QueequegTheater> Havelyns got nerfed at some point IIRC
[0:43:16] <whiteblacklight74> shieldless life
[0:43:25] <andre11dr> Im actually like DS3 more than DS1
[0:43:29] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> DS2's biggest strength is being BAD lmao owned
[0:43:32] <mandjelo> Video games have the worst cases of wood furniture/item termites.
[0:43:44] <%patriotrenegade> thats a lot of dudes
[0:43:53] <mandjelo> Is that Jim Serling?
[0:44:00] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Oh, yes, it's true. They absolutely bait you sometimes. They started doing it a lot more in DS2.
[0:44:09] <darkfilled> ds1 pvp has 90 degree back stabs, i don't like it.
[0:44:12] <$QueequegTheater> @mandjelo He's not ambulance chasing for controversy clicks, so no
[0:44:33] <DianaTheAscian> did ds2 let you pick pyromancer in the beginning?
[0:44:33] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Yeah, that's a real thing.
[0:44:35] <+ReallyBigRocks> Lol, his exertion sounds while running up the stairs "ehhh heeh"
[0:44:39] <andre11dr> Well let's be real, all DS pvp is jank as fuck
[0:44:43] <$QueequegTheater> @DianaTheAscian Yes
[0:44:47] <$QueequegTheater> I think?
[0:44:48] <andre11dr> In all of them
[0:44:52] <$QueequegTheater> Spy would know
[0:44:57] <mandjelo> @QueequegTheater Oh, I assumed that was him retreating into his den to make another groundbreaking Ubisoft critque
[0:45:05] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Seriously, GG. Those three knights are one of the hardest encounters in the game.
[0:45:05] <%patriotrenegade> The delayed swing in Dark Souls is what kills people the most
[0:45:07] <darkfilled> true, the pvp could be way better.
[0:45:07] <+ColonelHandzLanza> No pyro in ds2
[0:45:12] <DianaTheAscian> @QueequegTheater werid cause I feel like it didn't
[0:45:15] <+ColonelHandzLanza> not as a starting class anyway
[0:45:18] <NeonBleu> omg he did it
[0:45:19] <%hax_metatron> Time for a kino cutscene, probably a top 5 best boss cutscene in the entire SOULS franchise
[0:45:23] <$QueequegTheater> @mandjelo "Unpaid overtime is bad, please clap"
[0:45:26] <Lancaster_H> good job kilij
[0:45:30] <OblivionSword1> 25 full moon
[0:45:30] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> once upon a time a single blue eye was a challenge
[0:45:34] <%krispen_wa> DS PvP would be my favorite fighting game...if it wasnt the jankiest shit ever.
[0:45:36] <%Noonoox12> @WoolieVersus you gonna remind him about the red-eye knight outside'a King Doran?
[0:45:38] <mandjelo> @QueequegTheater LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL
[0:45:41] <$QueequegTheater> @DianaTheAscian Yeah, my memory failed me
[0:45:42] <darkfilled> deprived is my fav starting class always.
[0:45:44] <%A_German_spy> @Lancaster_H Wow
[0:45:55] <pmda2126> Reggarth the Bully
[0:45:57] <whiteblacklight74> everyday
[0:45:58] <linSP> Biorr the chad soon
[0:45:59] <$QueequegTheater> Oh shit that leaf is almost purp
[0:46:00] <%hax_metatron> Upcoming boss is the boss fight FromSoft has been trying to shape and chase ever since this game
[0:46:12] <whiteblacklight74> sup bro
[0:46:15] <+ReallyBigRocks> A sword can't kill knights without a Reggarth to swing it
[0:46:17] <%hax_metatron> Shadow of the Colossus land LUL
[0:46:25] <mtlsars> DONT JUMP Reggie!
[0:46:25] <%krispen_wa> DS2 is a whole game of failed Penetrators
[0:46:26] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1364103397230718976?s=19
[0:46:26] <+twohitgood> probably want to ditch the crescent grass at this point. it's more of a risk than help.
[0:46:50] <SilverFaustX> damn im a hour late
[0:46:50] <%A_German_spy> Wha karacoLOL
[0:46:51] <andre11dr> I think Penetrator is cool, but they made better versions of this type of fight later on
[0:46:55] <%krispen_wa> and one REALLY successful one in Raime
[0:46:59] <whiteblacklight74> EPIC POLITICAL COMMENTARY
[0:47:06] <%patriotrenegade> prepare ur butthole
[0:47:08] <Lancaster_H> montreal has fat officials?
[0:47:10] <%hax_metatron> @andre11dr Exactly, but what a template for a boss fight it is
[0:47:15] <linSP> fat evil!
[0:47:15] <@Solidus_113> unclench
[0:47:23] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @mandjelo
[0:47:24] <pmda2126> let's go
[0:47:24] <$QueequegTheater> @hax_metatron Eh, I think 1, 2, 3, and BB all have at least one or two fights as good as Penny (Artorias/O&S, Fume Knight/Alonne, Nameless King, Gehrman)
[0:47:24] <whiteblacklight74> prepare ypur anus

[0:49:50] <%Prattlesworth> Is this guy proto onion bro?
[0:49:52] <%Lion_kun> OG onion bro
[0:49:56] <andre11dr> Chat, if he one shots Old Monk I'll be really disappointed in you
[0:50:02] <%A_German_spy> @Prattlesworth Proto Solaire/Onionbro
[0:50:03] <BlackermanZX> good job Bjor and Kilij
[0:50:09] <jorniev> does yuria show up too or I'm just imagining things?
[0:50:12] <whiteblacklight74> large penetration
[0:50:16] <%krispen_wa> The peak of the game
[0:50:17] <darkfilled> all that was missing was him going hmmmm, hmmmm.
[0:50:17] <+FuqBoiSlim> what fight?
[0:50:21] <%patriotrenegade> what fight
[0:50:24] <+ReallyBigRocks> @A_German_spy Sunion Knight?
[0:50:27] <+cvp5127> fight?
[0:50:28] <$QueequegTheater> @jorniev not in a boss fight
[0:50:30] <%Deekman> time to die
[0:50:31] <%A_German_spy> @ReallyBigRocks Something like that, yeah
[0:50:47] <%ChoculaUltra> I didn't realize the From Soft "throw body at the camera/player" went back to DeS. P neat
[0:50:58] <%krispen_wa> BEST BOSS
[0:50:59] <peachy996> You keep cutting it close with NPCs lol
[0:51:07] <andre11dr> Well, NG+ Penetrator is a different story, Bjor will get melted by him
[0:51:07] <+Jiggisnipe> Kappa
[0:51:11] <%patriotrenegade> patriotrenegade is continuing the Gift Sub they got from an anonymous user!
[0:51:48] <andre11dr> You can rescue him after the fight i believe
[0:52:02] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Yeah i rescued him after
[0:52:04] <%patriotrenegade> @A_German_spy What happens if you beat Penentrator without freeing Bjor, and then go free him after?
[0:52:06] <+cvp5127> same
[0:52:08] <$QueequegTheater> Man I still can't believe how overpowered some of the SotFS summons are. Bradley can solo the boss rush in the throne room
[0:52:15] <darkfilled> that was too easy tho, wtf?
[0:52:18] <Lancaster_H> honestly the only summon I care for is still Solaire vs Drake and Josh, others all make it a cakewalk
[0:52:19] <%X2Eliah> Penetrator represents the evolved man of Boletaria.
[0:52:21] <+TheotherKristian> Has Reggie gotten to Mud Hellhole yet?
[0:52:22] <%krispen_wa> dont forget Jester Tarkus
[0:52:22] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Cause i didnt know what the key opened LUL
[0:52:28] <%A_German_spy> @patriotrenegade Biorr's questline continues as normal, you just skip his dialogue leading up to the Penetrator fight
[0:52:35] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @theotherkristian i dont think so yet
[0:53:01] <%SuckerPunchSyd> God the penetrator fight 1v1 is so fun
[0:53:01] <Ner234> Coolest move
[0:53:05] <pmda2126> he did it to biorr during the fight
[0:53:33] <%patriotrenegade> The impalement and toss across the arena is a favorite in DS3 boss fights. I had Gundyr toss me off the cliff a couple times
[0:53:33] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:54:08] <%krispen_wa> wait gundyr has a grab?

[0:54:29] <+Jiggisnipe> Orstein and Smough version 0.5
[0:54:32] <+ReallyBigRocks> Woolie's coming in hard with the unintentional innuendos today
[0:55:07] <peachy996> When you accidently hit your buddy in a fight, your friend turns around and says "Oh word?" and it turns into a Handicap match
[0:55:12] <LunarRemix> But it makes you wonder, if guys like Biorr are that strong how did Boletaria even fall in the first place?
[0:55:14] <+TheotherKristian> Just the tip was enough to make the 2 people mad
[0:55:21] <Johannen> Gosh darn it, almost missed another stream
[0:55:24] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Saved clips should be under "Media"
[0:56:00] <redrins> you can disable that if you want
[0:56:12] <%Deekman> takes a video clip when you unlock a trophy now

[1:00:15] <+Graxe_> Yeah, forgiveness is in the remake

[1:01:20] <peachy996> Butthurt Biorr
[1:01:23] <Raldavar> Briorr got paid to forgive, but he'll never forget
[1:01:23] <Pookiedaexzile> FORGIVEN BUT NOT FORGOTTEN
[1:01:24] <redrins> He forgave you, but that doesnt mean he likes you Kappa
[1:01:28] <$QueequegTheater> "I won't kill you but we're not friends"
[1:01:31] <darkfilled> just kill em. he's the one that needs you woolie.
[1:01:35] <jorniev> what type of BUG is that?
[1:01:39] <Prevot> you can't solve every problem by shoving money into it, woolie. you hurt his feelings
[1:01:40] <+freystreams> Bjor sounds very tsundere
[1:01:44] <+twohitgood> that sucks. i bet QA found it but they weren't able to fix it.
[1:01:49] <andre11dr> So he became Vegeta
[1:01:51] <+FuqBoiSlim> HE'S MALDING
[1:01:59] <$QueequegTheater> @Prevot That sounds like poor people logic Kappa
[1:02:04] <Lancaster_H> wasnt absolving in ds1 as well?
[1:02:05] <+twohitgood> that's way too obvious to test aggroing every npc and making sure forgiveness works.
[1:02:07] <NeonBleu> I won't kill you, but I don't have to save you"
[1:02:17] <$QueequegTheater> @Lancaster_H yes but not DeS original
[1:02:21] <Ner234> tbf you hit him with a cursed DBS. I'd be mad forever too
[1:02:30] <Lancaster_H> ah right
[1:02:32] <darkfilled> i like being the villain too much.
[1:02:34] <Lancaster_H> cheers
[1:02:43] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus There's another bug in the next area where if World Tendency is Pure Black, Biorr is just hostile to you when he shouldn't be, and he asks you if you need some help, then he kills you spyWhy
[1:03:05] <whiteblacklight74> IT'S A WEAPON
[1:03:05] <%Seancicle> brb afk
[1:03:09] <+twohitgood> he helps you with all that extra blood you're carrying in your body.
[1:03:10] <andre11dr> Kinda
[1:03:17] <+Jiggisnipe> yea he's gonna help you lose your life Kappa
[1:03:18] <andre11dr> It's pretty slow tho

[1:03:28] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[1:03:33] <NeonBleu> that's a cool bug LUL
[1:03:40] <LunarRemix> If you think about it it's just like O&S
[1:03:49] <Dabrikishaw> Demon Remake being this buggy feels right.
[1:03:52] <%krispen_wa> need help...reaching the grave!?
[1:03:58] <whiteblacklight74> tbh reggi is done with the fire area so he doesn't need the fire shield so much anymore
[1:04:12] <andre11dr> @jorniev That's not fair, door shield is actually stupid in pvp
[1:04:44] <darkfilled> pros make it look like you don't need anything in any game.
[1:04:45] <Raldavar> guard break of 70 meaning you'll block forever unless it's dragon god, but you've already killed it
[1:04:50] <whiteblacklight74> i hit it until it died thomas
[1:04:58] <CappuccinoGuil> Stick them with the pointy end
[1:05:02] <jorniev> specially off you get a couple of friends with door shields too
[1:05:11] <Pookiedaexzile> Stockbitch Thomas

[1:05:17] <linSP> the wall the wall

[1:05:49] <darkfilled> he knows how to let his wife and kid die.
[1:06:30] <whiteblacklight74> penetrate magic
[1:06:32] <andre11dr> Invading people in the ash lake catacombs and getting someone with door shield is really dumb because you can't go past them

[1:07:40] <andre11dr> Now should we tell Reggie about cracked talisman of beasts?
[1:07:41] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:08:04] <Raldavar> curse is a flat physical damage percentage boost. It's good on all physical weapons
[1:08:06] <%RaziWraith> Yes, too bad woolie sheltered Reggie from Wild West Demon Souls PvP LUL
[1:08:14] <%patriotrenegade> @WoolieVersus omg please look at Spy's clip
[1:08:21] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Reggie would be better off using non-scaling buffs right now. Curse Weapon would be good, and so would the Pine Resin items.
[1:08:33] <darkfilled> pvp is part of the game no?
[1:08:48] <%krispen_wa> POWER
[1:08:52] <%RaziWraith> and you can choose whether or not to participate

[1:09:55] <+freystreams> cursed weapon so OP, it bugs the game

[1:10:13] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus There's a way you can weaken the curse from Curse Weapon, though. You cast it with a Talisman of Beasts that you don't have the stats to use, and you still get the full damage buff, but the curse gets weakened and barely damages you. That's called a "Cracked" Talisman of Beasts.
[1:10:36] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> lololol cracked talisman is the best
[1:10:42] <+fetrigon> @A_German_spy KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype
[1:10:45] <Raldavar> they fixed that in this remake
[1:10:52] <Equirah> @A_German_spy wollie was doing that in his video
[1:11:00] <%A_German_spy> @Raldavar They didn't. It still works.
[1:11:00] <linSP> you can still cast cursed wep on beast talis without required stats for same buff with no degen
[1:11:11] <sonofthedeepsouth> NAH FAM its fine
[1:11:16] <darkfilled> only cowards don't want reggie to pvp.
[1:11:16] <%RaziWraith> at least they fixed running firestorm LUL
[1:11:39] <%Seancicle> FootYellow
[1:11:43] <%X2Eliah> Not "beware your power". But specifically "limits". Huh.
[1:11:45] <darkfilled> ya'll afraid of reggie!
[1:11:47] <%RaziWraith> that's an opinion. Shitty people can do shitty things in pvp.
[1:12:00] <+fetrigon> @A_German_spy You're so cool. I loved your tactics ogre playthrough.
[1:12:04] <whiteblacklight74> Curse Weapon + Makoto is probably the most Nagoriyuki cosplay you'll ever get tbh

[1:13:23] <Raldavar> @A_German_spy oh damn you're right
[1:13:28] <LunarRemix> Second warning
[1:13:33] <%Noonoox12> Time for 3-3 yeyeyeye
[1:13:35] <LunarRemix> Maybe Yurt is a cool guy Reggie.

[1:13:55] <seniormeatbox> Hurt Yurt
[1:13:56] <%Noonoox12> or, wait, oops, 3-2
[1:13:56] <CappuccinoGuil> Oh wow, never knew they had so many lines about Yurt pre-meeting him
[1:13:58] <%A_German_spy> @Raldavar I know because I've been using it myself in co-op. I run a Greatsword build, though. Never did like the DBS.
[1:13:58] <LVL1_Scumbag> Patches did northing wrong
[1:13:59] <Johannen> -_- Kappa Reggie on his guard
[1:14:02] <sonofthedeepsouth> Patches knows all and does nothing wrong
[1:14:03] <%Prattlesworth> Yeah, maybe Yurt is pretty chill
[1:14:07] <andre11dr> I just hope Reggie experience THE HEADBUTT at least once, it's the DeS experience
[1:14:21] <%A_German_spy> @andre11dr Woolie showed him already
[1:14:29] <Pookiedaexzile> LUL psaBig psaBig maybe
[1:14:30] <alroy900> don't listen to lying patches, yurt is a cool dude
[1:14:37] <darkfilled> now now, yurt deserves a chance at life same as everyone else.
[1:14:49] <dundore77> Yurt never kicked you down a pit
[1:14:50] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1364103397230718976?s=19
[1:14:53] <%ozzrabbit> Reggie, I know you’re not fond of him right now, but for the love of god listen to Patches on this one. Yurt is NOT a cool guy!
[1:15:00] <+TheotherKristian> Patches is a best friend who happens to lie
[1:15:02] <alroy900> yurt did nothing wrong
[1:15:09] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Pine Resin or Black Pine Resin will work well in the meantime. They don't scale, they just give flat fire damage on your weapon.
[1:15:11] <%RaziWraith> Yo dudes. This Yurt guy is pretty chill. Maybe you should like....join him or something. LUL
[1:15:16] <wantedsafe471> Patches is a good friend after he tries to kill you
[1:15:18] <Equirah> @ozzrabbit shut up, let him have his own playthrough
[1:15:26] <andre11dr> Yurt is the best NPC ,he given you the Chieftains Ring
[1:15:28] <SoulKarl> ignore this man - yurt is a cool guy and just wants to hang out, let him into your heart and home
[1:15:33] <+FuqBoiSlim> Yurt is based stop the slander
[1:15:34] <darkfilled> yurt been locked and treated like an animal. free yurt!
[1:15:35] <SarcFa> Catalyst's MagAdjust *1.3 for light weapon iirc
[1:15:35] <+TheotherKristian> Yurt is hot
[1:15:45] <redrins> extra damage is extra damage even if resisted
[1:15:56] <MyNameIsRasus> Dirt McYurt
[1:15:59] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Light Weapon doesn't scale with your catalyst.
[1:16:04] <okramv> get those resins boay
[1:16:07] <MyNameIsRasus> Old Yurty Bastard
[1:16:17] <Johannen> "There is always the resins" says Woolie with hidden distaste for consumable items)
[1:16:18] <+MrAtheGreat> Yurt’s the best. He really grows on you.
[1:16:23] <whiteblacklight74> get the sticky white stuff for your weapon
[1:16:28] <+TheotherKristian> I trust Yurt
[1:16:37] <MyNameIsRasus> Yurt 2024
[1:16:38] <fruit_pie_the_magician> In DS2 I used to dual wield blue flames, buffing the right hand one with magic resin and then using the buffed right hand one to super buff the left hand one
[1:16:44] <Johannen> Yurt realy connects with the community
[1:16:48] <pmda2126> Vote Yurt
[1:16:48] <darkfilled> yurt = lautrec on steroids.
[1:16:51] <andre11dr> Now he might not even do Latria today, he might go TO FUCKING POISON HELL
[1:16:51] <%ozzrabbit> @equirah you know as well as I do what he does. I’m not saying any specifics, and am trying to to spoil anything, but the signs are too big on this one to be ignored.
[1:17:12] <wantedsafe471> Yurt=Lautrek but better
[1:17:13] <+MrAtheGreat> Yurt belongs to MBGA
[1:17:17] <SoulKarl> I can safely say the more time you spend with yurt the more he'll become the only npc you'll care about.
[1:17:17] <%ozzrabbit> @equirah not trying to spoil anything*
[1:17:23] <whiteblacklight74> Reggie's gonna have to put stat into it anyways
[1:17:25] <%Double_Tap_That> @woolieversus He can also use the ring to get an extra slot
[1:17:26] <Equirah> @ozzrabbit and it's up to reggie to believe them or not, let *him* play the game
[1:17:27] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus There's a ring you can wear that gives you another spell slot, if you're willing to lose a ring slot for it
[1:17:36] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus You get it near where you rescue Yuria
[1:17:39] <therealtacopancakes> does reggie have the ring that gives him an extra slot?
[1:17:45] <+Graxe_> Apparently, Dan's super taunt in SFV instantly kills him at the very end if he gets punished by the opponent with their own super
[1:17:47] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Hahaha, thought not karacoLOL
[1:17:57] <MyNameIsRasus> 4 ring slots in DS2 and 3 Kreygasm
[1:18:00] <+Graxe_> Like he just takes a massive increase in damage
[1:18:11] <%Noonoox12> @wantedsafe471 but Lautrec earns your trust before he betrays you, and then you have to go on a grand quest to get your revenge and chase him down! Yurt just gets freed, shows up, and kills 'til you stop him. That's way less thematic
[1:18:14] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> consider this: foot rings
[1:18:15] <+TheotherKristian> Can't wait until Reggie goes on a hot date with Yurt
[1:18:18] <+waltzqueen> @A_German_spy hey spy, good to see you Souls-by-proxying
[1:18:33] <%A_German_spy> @waltzqueen Heya! I'm just here to support my boys.
[1:18:37] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Wrong spell

[1:18:41] <Lancaster_H> wrong one
[1:18:44] <therealtacopancakes> wrong spell
[1:18:44] <%Double_Tap_That> wrong spell
[1:18:45] <MyNameIsRasus> wrong one
[1:18:46] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus He attuned ENchant Weapon. You want Light Weapon
[1:18:48] <sendart> Wrong spell lol
[1:18:52] <%DegenCat> you turned on magic weapon not light weapon
[1:18:53] <%ozzrabbit> @equirah I’m not going to argue with you on this, because having an argument while trying to talk around spoilers is tedious. Suffice to say, this is the only instance where I hope Woolie steps in of he has to.
[1:18:56] <Pookiedaexzile> WRONG SPELL
[1:18:56] <andre11dr> God i pray Woolie doesn't say shit when Yurt shows up ,i can't wait

[1:19:29] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Reggie attuned the wrong spell. He went with Enchant Weapon. You need Light Weapon, and you have to unequip both of the other spells to fit it.
[1:19:41] <%A_German_spy> Yeah, that's the one!
[1:19:46] <%DegenCat> woolieYE woolieGLORY woolieFUN
[1:19:56] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Not crazy. You were super right that it should have taken 2 slots.
[1:19:58] <CappuccinoGuil> wait, why is he not wearing a helmet?
[1:19:59] <+matteasyplays> My fine magician friend Kreygasm
[1:20:02] <andre11dr> Now are we going to take to the sky or are we going to hell?
[1:20:04] <+Jiggisnipe> what? Kappa
[1:20:09] <MyNameIsRasus> LIGHTSABER
[1:20:09] <%A_German_spy> @CappuccinoGuil He is, but he has "Show Helmet" turned off
[1:20:10] <%X2Eliah> My fine chicken friend
[1:20:11] <%Zero_Jacks> lytMOTIVATED More power
[1:20:12] <wantedsafe471> OH, that looks awesome

[1:20:26] <Afrosamasenpai> ooooo shiny
[1:20:27] <%X2Eliah> realistic medieval simulation
[1:20:28] <CappuccinoGuil> @A_German_spy gotcha. Would it be a good idea for him to put on the silver circlet for the MP regen?
[1:20:29] <+matteasyplays> What a video game
[1:20:32] <darkfilled> arlexuPopcorn
[1:20:38] <MyNameIsRasus> What a mysterious jogo
[1:20:41] <Johannen> Woolie is all about that Edge
[1:20:49] <Equirah> LUL
[1:20:52] <+ReallyBigRocks> The magic effects in this are SO GOOD
[1:20:55] <%A_German_spy> @CappuccinoGuil Circlet just gives a small percentage boost to max MP. It's the Fragrant Ring and Crescent Weapons that give regen.
[1:20:57] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @jorniev
[1:20:57] <MyNameIsRasus> Woolie loves edge. That's why he loves Snyder
[1:21:02] <linSP> the stage of history is real
[1:21:10] <linSP> soul caliburrr
[1:21:11] <%A_German_spy> @CappuccinoGuil So no, it wouldn't really help him.
[1:21:11] <andre11dr> I would be more happy seeing it if it didn't bring nightmare of Blue Blood pvp damage
[1:21:15] <SoulKarl> oh wow what a nice addition
[1:21:16] <therealtacopancakes> those specks of light are fucking beautiful, damn
[1:21:19] <darkfilled> i like the clashing of metal sounds too.
[1:21:23] <%Prattlesworth> Wasn't there a shield in storage they wanted to check out or something?
[1:21:28] <MyNameIsRasus> buy yourself something pretty
[1:21:35] <%A_German_spy> @Prattlesworth Tower Shield. They already checked it out.
[1:21:40] <Johannen> Reggie refuses to shop at Wallmart now?
[1:21:45] <CappuccinoGuil> @A_German_spy ooooh I thought it was regen.
[1:21:46] <%MaximumDaximum> Damn, Reggarth looks sick now
[1:21:46] <%Prattlesworth> Ah alright, thank you
[1:22:01] <%A_German_spy> @CappuccinoGuil Easy to misunderstand. The item descriptions aren't always clear.
[1:22:02] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:22:04] <+ReallyBigRocks> would it be worth to spend the souls on some more higher tier grass?
[1:22:07] <Raldavar> what about that Vergil cosplay tho?
[1:22:09] <+matteasyplays> M E A T
[1:22:10] <%A_German_spy> @Prattlesworth No worries.
[1:22:12] <%Noonoox12> @WoolieVersus kilij is stronger than makoto now
[1:22:14] <andre11dr> You can't buff Makoto right?
[1:22:15] <darkfilled> wallmart is the best. wallmart is always there for me( :
[1:22:22] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Meat Cleaver can't be upgraded. It's already super OP.
[1:22:30] <%RaziWraith> the weeb is strong with Reggie! Don't resist! woolieSMUG
[1:22:39] <redrins> yeah meat cleaver already has bonkers scaling, you cant upgrade it
[1:22:47] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus But normally, yeah, you'd use Colorless Souls.
[1:22:57] <%Lion_kun> Buff it up
[1:22:59] <Johannen> How many Colorless can you even get on the white tendency? Like 2?
[1:23:09] <%A_German_spy> @Johannen 7 per game cycle, total
[1:23:25] <%A_German_spy> @Johannen There used to be an exploit where you could farm them infinitely, but it's been nerfed spyWhy
[1:23:25] <%Lion_kun> You can totally upgrade the cleaver.
[1:23:34] <%A_German_spy> @Lion_kun Not in this game you can't
[1:23:36] <+matteasyplays> S P I C Y

[1:23:46] <%Lion_kun> I upgraded it in classic!
[1:23:58] <Equirah> @Lion_kun is this classic?
[1:24:01] <%Lion_kun> Why did they nerf my boy :(
[1:24:06] <%X2Eliah> wait did reggie kill himself
[1:24:09] <%X2Eliah> ah yes ok
[1:24:13] <andre11dr> Time for Reggie to get executed
[1:24:25] <%patriotrenegade> through the gates of hell! as we make our way to heaven! through the boletarian lines!
[1:24:26] <%A_German_spy> @Lion_kun They didn't. It wasn't upgradable in the original either. It's crafted from club weapons, which are also non-upgradable, which I guess is part of why.

[1:25:37] <%A_German_spy> @Lion_kun Yeah. The upgrade system in Demon's Souls is so convoluted, it's easy to misremember upgrading something that can't be upgraded. I've done it a lot.

[1:33:22] <%MajkirM> @kewlmyc The restrictivo icon shows both.
[1:33:28] <Johannen> I could never get those items on the beams...always fell off)
[1:33:31] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Yeah, look at the bloodstains on the floor at the top of the chute. Then when you go down to the bottom, you see the corpses everywhere. And at the bottom, the pit is filled with water that empties into the moat.
[1:33:41] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> cheer755 I might be reading too much into this, but given that Estus replaces Grass in DS, DS2, and DS3, and this world goes to hell, could the Souls series be a cautionary tale about alcoholism? Food for thought.

[2:12:41] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> 5-2
[2:12:41] <bigepic69> Anor Londo archers but instead of lances they're hardend pieces of solidified stool sharpened a thousand times over.
[2:12:46] <andre11dr> It is here
[2:12:49] <%A_German_spy> @Lion_kun That's correct, yeah. It was never a deliberate mechanic until DS1, and they never really made a big deal about it until DS2 with the torch.
[2:13:01] <andre11dr> But he has to do the slug thing
[2:13:12] <%Amaideus> DS1 has the lantern
[2:13:20] <bigepic69> please dont tell me there's a slug here, slugs are gross.
[2:13:20] <%Amaideus> Assuming you're talking about lighting
[2:13:38] <%A_German_spy> @bigepic69 There's a slug here
[2:13:40] <%Lion_kun> Ds1 has a spell that casts light.
[2:13:44] <LunarRemix> It doesn't work really well outside the Tomb of the Giants
[2:13:45] <%A_German_spy> @bigepic69 In fact, there are many slugs here
[2:13:49] <bigepic69> NO
[2:13:54] <%Lion_kun> Used it in a spellcaster build.
[2:13:56] <%RaziWraith> This place is DARK in the OG game.
[2:14:04] <%X2Eliah> just render 33% of screen as pure black
[2:14:08] <wantedsafe471> Yeah, ds2 with this kind of lighting sould of been great
[2:14:14] <andre11dr> I do wish BB had more of that
[2:14:26] <%Lion_kun> You could get that pendant in the dlc with it too.
[2:14:29] <%RaziWraith> Reggie with the backstage pass LUL
[2:14:39] <bigepic69> The swamp is trying to hit reggie with the Brap Attack, but Reggie's SNOOF is able to nullify its effects!
[2:14:42] <Raldavar> Ds2 had this lighting, but only in the trailers
[2:14:44] <MyNameIsRasus> More like backstab pass
[2:14:50] <andre11dr> Like Grand Cathedral was really dark and there wasn't much like that area in BB
[2:14:51] <bigepic69> backstage pass to the poop zone
[2:15:08] <%RaziWraith> Reggie rating all these messages! :)
[2:15:08] <wantedsafe471> Imagine DS2, but remade by bluepoint. that'd be the shit
[2:15:09] <%Lion_kun> I want a remake of 2 where they fix that lighting.
[2:15:28] <MyNameIsRasus> I just want powerstance back
[2:15:31] <%Amaideus> I wonder how much less shit DS2 would get if it looked modern
[2:15:34] <+ReallyBigRocks> Hopefully we'll see a lot more dramatic lighting now that good dynamic shadows aren't the absolute performance killer they used to be
[2:15:34] <andre11dr> @wantedsafe471 If they changed the bosses, yeah
[2:15:36] <%Lion_kun> The original lighting completely changes the game.
[2:15:39] <bigepic69> reggie you've made that man too powerful with your appraisals. he has become the Demons' Souls.
[2:15:52] <bigepic69> ew
[2:15:54] <OblivionSword1> POWER TO THE ASS
[2:15:58] <wantedsafe471> Yeah, some bosses need to be redone to be good
[2:16:03] <%Amaideus> Reggie is the real lucky ted

[2:16:59] <bigepic69> The Shitabitants of Turdtopis slide out of the Gamer holes.
[2:17:04] <+ReallyBigRocks> I don't want to think about poop molds at all
[2:17:24] <bigepic69> is there a poop sword or a stool spear?
[2:17:25] <whiteblacklight74> return to poop
[2:17:25] <wantedsafe471> For DS2 remastered to be good they'd have to: light the lighting, fix soul memory, and fix the bad bosses
[2:17:26] <%patriotrenegade> you'd die of methane poisoning in here
[2:17:27] <%Lion_kun> The DS2 DLC is some of the best level design in the series though.
[2:17:27] <%X2Eliah> It's probably more methane
[2:17:36] <Raldavar> The character can only move in 8 directions, including when you try to tur around

[2:18:06] <%X2Eliah> So the sheen means it's oily, right?
[2:18:08] <%Lion_kun> How do fix Covetous lol
[2:18:08] <%Amaideus> Huh
[2:18:13] <whiteblacklight74> fart gas
[2:18:14] <%Amaideus> I never noticed that in DS2
[2:18:16] <%X2Eliah> Because poop by itslef is not really that shiny
[2:18:24] <%Amaideus> I'll have to go test that some time
[2:18:27] <%X2Eliah> and shiny liquids usually denote oil
[2:18:28] <whiteblacklight74> the poop thief
[2:18:29] <MyNameIsRasus> I've been training myself to use more consumables, it's reallyy hard
[2:18:29] <%A_German_spy> @X2Eliah That, and/or there's a layer of liquid floating on top of it
[2:18:30] <bigepic69> lesser souls have been replaced with colostomy bags of varying stages of capacity.

[2:30:05] <bigepic69> They suffered greatly in the Inturdment camps. This is my homeland, my promised land, my Jerusalem; where you se nothing but Fecal Funnies, I see my PEOPLES, Woolie. I will not abide my homeland being shlandered.
[2:30:10] <+ReallyBigRocks> The real Slug Souls starts here
[2:30:19] <MyNameIsRasus> Demon Slugs
[2:30:29] <whiteblacklight74> The true successor to snailborne
[2:30:39] <%Amaideus> I appreciate these bigepic69
[2:30:40] <specialpipo> Slugborne
[2:30:43] <MyNameIsRasus> Placebo sometimes
[2:30:46] <prime_name> Kinda
[2:30:48] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> @WoolieVersus I went back to Power Rangers for a bit (to see it in english) and hearing Vergil is too much. LUL
[2:30:49] <+ReallyBigRocks> Kinda?
[2:30:50] <Equirah> nah
[2:30:52] <DianaTheAscian> it kinda did
[2:30:55] <%kewlmyc> Kinda
[2:30:57] <Matt_Cowdery> Leeches are useful to induce blood flow
[2:30:59] <%X2Eliah> eeh
[2:30:59] <enZymeth> Sanguine gang
[2:31:00] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus The leeches are a real thing. They do have legitimate medical uses, even today
[2:31:01] <%RaziWraith> It would work to some degree but there were other problems LUL
[2:31:02] <%X2Eliah> no thnx
[2:31:07] <%KeiganOfAstora> Yea leeches are a thing
[2:31:08] <$QueequegTheater> "Ah yes, my Bill Burr is acting up today"
[2:31:11] <Mr_Zero5232> Leeches drink infected blood
[2:31:13] <peachy996> Ah the Slug cuddle puddle
[2:31:16] <bigepic69> Do not be fooled: people who like slugs are just many slugs that have been shoved into a human-sized and shaped condom.
[2:31:16] <BurdRightsActivist> HUMORS MISALIGNED
[2:31:17] <linSP> attack sack
[2:31:18] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I mean it would maybe do stuff, but not anything they actually understoo
[2:31:20] <Murdercles> a bow can solve a lot of problems here
[2:31:21] <Crowroost> Lick it, coward
[2:31:23] <%X2Eliah> Leeches are still useful
[2:31:25] <whiteblacklight74> welcome to the nest
[2:31:29] <andre11dr> Plague doctor medicine was kinda made up bullshit, useful in Darkest Dungeon tho
[2:31:31] <%X2Eliah> You wnat rosy cheecks you put leeches on them
[2:31:31] <+Jiggisnipe> nasty
[2:31:32] <dundore77> use the cleaver

[2:31:48] <%KeiganOfAstora> Goopie goop
[2:31:48] <BurdRightsActivist> There was literally a ledge to attack from there 4Head
[2:31:48] <%RaziWraith> "Don't fall" Falls. You hate to see it. LUL
[2:31:49] <peachy996> Oh you're fallin buddy
[2:31:49] <specialpipo> "Don't fall!" - Proceeds to fall anyway
[2:31:50] <Equirah> don't what?
[2:31:51] <%A_German_spy> spyShock
[2:31:52] <bigepic69> Reggie has been lost in the sauce.
[2:31:53] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> you did it
[2:31:53] <dundore77> use the big swing on the cleaver
[2:31:54] <Crowroost> 2 HORNY 4 SLUGS
[2:31:55] <%Lion_kun> Reggie you had spells
[2:31:55] <%Amaideus> Swamp of Sorrows indeed
[2:31:57] <MyNameIsRasus> impatience is the mind killer
[2:31:59] <Darthkitten_Prime> Swamp of Sorrow is right
[2:32:00] <brunoberserk> slug WINS AGAIN
[2:32:02] <%dreadedcthulhu> "dont fall" buddy you already fell
[2:32:04] <%X2Eliah> ....
[2:32:06] <pmda2126> slug wins
[2:32:07] <%X2Eliah> Reggie
[2:32:09] <whiteblacklight74> @Lion_kun he took light weapon, that's his one spell
[2:32:12] <MyNameIsRasus> RUN IT BACK
[2:32:14] <Equirah> LUL
[2:32:21] <linSP> they put a fence there so you can safely attack
[2:32:23] <MyNameIsRasus> Or more like
[2:32:25] <%Lion_kun> Use a bow then.
[2:32:27] <MyNameIsRasus> slowly crawl it back
[2:32:27] <%A_German_spy> karacoLOL
[2:32:29] <%KeiganOfAstora> What is this? I like this
[2:32:30] <%Amaideus> So is it a victory per slug he kills, or per time he escapes the zone?
[2:32:31] <pmda2126> Murphy Lee dominant thus far
[2:32:31] <%Prattlesworth> On today's stream, Reggie performs the role of Fall Guy
[2:32:32] <%RaziWraith> 2/3 matchup. Reggie in the loser's bracket LUL
[2:32:36] <+MyshkaMysh> Yay, go St. Louis!
[2:32:38] <+ReallyBigRocks> Now THIS is Slug's Souls
[2:32:54] <bigepic69> god damnit I just realized that it's not a little envelope next to people's names it's just a white reboot logo.
[2:32:54] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:32:55] <Equirah> if only the top executioner of the kingdom was a pile of slugs
[2:32:55] <%KeiganOfAstora> Only the real ones move
[2:33:17] <LunarRemix> Man those thing enemies are really gross
[2:33:23] <LunarRemix> You can't even tell whta they're supposed to be
[2:33:23] <MyNameIsRasus> The trademark touch of a From Slugs game is the Moonlight GreatSlug
[2:33:37] <%patriotrenegade> patriotrenegade subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 2 month streak! No one ever talks about Gimli being not even slightly tempted by the Ring. Motherfucker had no hesitation just walked up with his axe and immediately tried to wreck it. Gold sickness in the line of Durin WHOMST?? Mot in Gimli, son of Gloin!
[2:33:38] <Crowroost> What if... you wanted progress, but the swamp said "slugs".
[2:33:45] <Lancaster_H> You remember Snailborne, now get ready for Slug Souls
[2:33:54] <bigepic69> I'm out of shit jokes, you could say I'm pooped.
[2:33:57] <X2Eliah> This shit swamp is also kinda confusing
[2:34:03] <%X2Eliah> like in layout
[2:34:11] <+ReallyBigRocks> There should be a Royal Slug Authority here
[2:34:12] <$QueequegTheater> Keep trading with him, eventually it'll work 4Head
[2:34:14] <whiteblacklight74> frames
[2:34:16] <%RaziWraith> Fall Guys but with Dark Souls map would probably have the same energy as Bloodborne Kart. woolieSMUG
[2:34:42] <andre11dr> Bloodborne Kart is the light and the way
[2:35:05] <bigepic69> If you drink the poo water and consume the floaters, you will gain the "the runs" buff, which makes you run faster and butterfly stroke through the Shit Slurry, the Shlurry, if you will.
[2:35:06] <whiteblacklight74> the gamer swamp
[2:35:07] <%Deekman> did he go past the party tunnel yet?
[2:35:13] <%A_German_spy> @RaziWraith Well, Dark Souls on that Halo map has the same energy as... Dark Souls on a Halo map
[2:35:23] <%A_German_spy> @Deekman Yeah, he foud it
[2:35:27] <%A_German_spy> *found
[2:35:32] <Equirah> @WoolieVersus they made doodoo LUL

[2:35:34] <Murdercles> yes, what a "life"
[2:35:36] <$QueequegTheater> The two things I can't stand are intolerance of other cultures, and the Dutch
[2:35:42] <%KeiganOfAstora> The bloody Dutch
[2:35:42] <%Deekman> @A_German_spy nice, i'll have to check out the vod. I had to step away
[2:36:00] <%A_German_spy> spyYuck

[2:36:15] <peachy996> Maybe that screaming guy is having fun, you don't know
[2:36:22] <MyNameIsRasus> The depraved don't come to your house and tell you how to live your life, just leave them be man BibleThump
[2:36:22] <$QueequegTheater> I've seen some doujins about this
[2:36:23] <%Javaa01> @whiteblacklight74 It builds character

[2:44:10] <redrins> most fromsoft games actually
[2:44:10] <%gatorafan> Reggie needs more Halo in his life Kappa
[2:44:11] <%Deekman> @A_German_spy that's why i figured he'd be from Kingsfield. Giving him a specific name seems odd
[2:44:11] <+Jiggisnipe> AND
[2:44:12] <MyNameIsRasus> Every single From Soft game**
[2:44:12] <+twohitgood> also in king's field.
[2:44:14] <Darren716> *Every Fromsoft game
[2:44:14] <+A0N33> Nearly every single FromSoft game, too
[2:44:15] <CalusRaccoon> EVEN bloodborne
[2:44:16] <therealtacopancakes> open up an incinerating corpses business
[2:44:21] <bigepic69> This isn't gamig, this is SHLUGOCIDE!
[2:44:21] <%ekodrop> every fromsoft game
[2:44:21] <%jepupu> Moonlight sword is also in Armored Core games
[2:44:23] <peachy996> Guiding Moonlight
[2:44:26] <redrins> also look at how much it weights

[2:44:31] <CoffeeSlice> Sekiro gets that sword too yea
[2:44:32] <%ZweihanderSteve> its in armored core lmao
[2:44:33] <%Amaideus> ALso
[2:44:33] <%Frazzyfraznor> Never looked this cool
[2:44:34] <Equirah> @jepupu every from soft game
[2:44:37] <%Amaideus> It weighs nothing practically
[2:44:40] <Afrosamasenpai> [horse neighs in the distance]
[2:44:41] <andre11dr> Where did it first show up?
[2:44:45] <Crowroost> MoonlightLegacy
[2:44:45] <CappuccinoGuil> @WoolieVersus it's in every FromSoft game. It's in Metal Wolf Chaos and King's Field too
[2:44:46] <%jepupu> Is it in Sekiro?
[2:44:54] <%Amaideus> It is not in Sekiro
[2:44:55] <MyNameIsRasus> King's field is first appearence I think
[2:44:56] <andre11dr> Kinda
[2:44:57] <%Amaideus> Sig sad
[2:44:58] <%A_German_spy> @andre11dr The first King's Field game, if memory serves
[2:45:02] <%Amaideus> Big sad*
[2:45:04] <CalusRaccoon> not really in sekiro no...

[2:45:25] <+freystreams> well, fight me god
[2:45:26] <CappuccinoGuil> Kill God with the Sword
[2:45:28] <Blank9> shows up repeatedly in other ones, along with a dark version and a fused version
[2:45:29] <Lefteron> Attack and dethrone god
[2:45:32] <bigepic69> They're trying to find a place to put the moonlight in Elden Ring but they cant figure it out, thus the delays.
[2:45:41] <%A_German_spy> @MyNameIsRasus No, sadly. That was added later
[2:45:46] <Lancaster_H> Fellas is it religious to like the moonlight?
[2:45:47] <MyNameIsRasus> Oh bummer

[2:57:55] <%RaziWraith> @WoolieVersus Loss happens to everyone in this game. Even the best of us. :(
[2:58:01] <%A_German_spy> @MyNameIsRasus Well, you probably use big shields that are actually meant for blocking. Adjudicator's Shield is an exception, because it has the super-good regen effect.
[2:58:02] <Blank9> and despite it all, I STILL LOVE YOU
[2:58:04] <The_wafflizer> Sounds like chewy crying
[2:58:05] <%Frazzyfraznor> BabyRage
[2:58:06] <bigepic69> And yet it's making Reggie mumble
[2:58:11] <magnumlockjaw> Now Reggie knows what its like to be poor
[2:58:11] <stevenellis386> you thought you were hot but now your knee deep in shit.
[2:58:12] <%kullumanati> Sorry wax face no bread today
[2:58:14] <+ReallyBigRocks> The best part was Woolie shit talking him for not healing RIGHT BEFORE
[2:58:17] <redrins> you just have to learn to not care about lost souls
[2:58:28] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> He needed 22,000 more lol
[2:58:29] <pmda2126> you'll get them back, it's ok
[2:58:29] <+cvp5127> humbled
[2:58:32] <%A_German_spy> @MyNameIsRasus So if you've never used it, it's understandable that you'd expect he'd block with it. But yeah, it's been on his back this whole time for a reason.
[2:58:33] <%Chatterbox1991> @Blank9 that dude was like a legendary boxer
[2:58:39] <%Chatterbox1991> Rocky Lotherage

[2:59:22] <$thomassolorio> don't worry reggie it's only 7 trips to the reeper
[2:59:32] <@Menitta> Menitta subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 24 months! What's up Woolie and Reggie! I've always accepted I'm bad at fighting games but I still like playing them. Strive might be the one to change that. I think I can get better at the game and break all my bad habits this time. Keep up the good work!
[2:59:35] <rcand9> dont fuck up
[2:59:37] <%Deekman> Buff that sword lol
[2:59:38] <bigepic69> Reggie's souls scattered through out the Shwamp's Chocolate Jelly River, each soul finding a home in its own turd. If you submerge your head in the water, you can sometimes hear the cries of scrubs.

[3:00:01] <MyNameIsRasus> @A_German_spy yes, i'm aware that it's not real good for blocking, just wasnt' expecting it to do nothing on block against the big boys.

[3:00:22] <%X2Eliah> Grossmart was an actual german brand name, wasn't it

[3:00:48] <%A_German_spy> @MyNameIsRasus Yeah. They deal a ton of stability damage. Nothing lighter than the Steel Shield works against them, and even then, you can't tank tons of hits.

[3:09:31] <%kullumanati> Reggie “would you like to go back to the tutorial”. Your input says you would like to go back to the tutorial.

[3:11:27] <+ReallyBigRocks> just flailing in the poo
[3:11:31] <+ReallyBigRocks> he did it tho
[3:11:40] <%Josef_Stryker> It's universally agreed world 5 is the worst right?
[3:11:46] <%X2Eliah> yuuup
[3:11:48] <%krispen_wa> yes
[3:11:51] <%KeiganOfAstora> yup
[3:11:55] <+Jiggisnipe> yeo
[3:11:56] <$thomassolorio> t101Big t101Oof
[3:11:57] <wantedsafe471> yep
[3:11:58] <%KeiganOfAstora> It's proto-Blighttown
[3:12:01] <Johannen> definitely
[3:12:17] <%KeiganOfAstora> I can't wait for Reggie to attempt Dark Souls 1
[3:12:18] <LunarRemix> I'd play Blighttown any day over this
[3:12:20] <$thomassolorio> t101YAM t101ERO
[3:12:22] <MyNameIsRasus> i mean swampzones are swampzones, some are better than others but they're always a shitshow
[3:12:22] <%RaziWraith> It's universally agreed that every poop world in the Dark Souls series is the worst.
[3:12:22] <%krispen_wa> Blighttown at least had interesting verticality and the swamp was only a small part of the level
[3:12:22] <heartlesshealer> I like how there's visible environment in this remake
[3:12:26] <Johannen> It stopped my from finishing Demon's Souls, only beaten it last week finaly
[3:12:28] <+ReallyBigRocks> honestly don't see how you could come to any other conclusion
[3:12:28] <%KeiganOfAstora> Blighttown certainly isn't as big as all of World 3
[3:12:30] <%KeiganOfAstora> 5*
[3:12:42] <wantedsafe471> At least blight town you can skip with the master key
[3:12:46] <%notsoy> reggie will never remember his fire spell, will he
[3:12:51] <andre11dr> Blighttown wishes it was as bad as this place
[3:12:52] <$thomassolorio> t101GANB t101ATTE
[3:12:52] <LunarRemix> If you take the master key at the start BlightTown is just a pit stop
[3:12:55] <pmda2126> this level does succeed in making you feel miserable
[3:13:04] <%RaziWraith> @notsoy not equipped. He uses Light Weapon now
[3:13:10] <%KeiganOfAstora> Oh yea, fire is good here. And he has a Dragon Longsword
[3:13:15] <%notsoy> oh yeah it's 2
[3:13:23] <%krispen_wa> REEEE
[3:13:29] <%notsoy> he has ed's sharpening stones tho right?
[3:13:30] <PanicSwytch> oh shit I just noticed the durability is real lo
[3:13:31] <%Juriasu> it sound kinda like that dinosaur thing obi-wan rides
[3:13:49] <%KeiganOfAstora> maybe use the shield sometimes too
[3:13:58] <MyNameIsRasus> Reggie remember to grass it up if needed, you can do it

[3:14:41] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus If you use Photo Mode to look at these guys' faces, they're actually wearing leather plague masks.

[3:15:13] <$thomassolorio> t101Hands t101Ohno
[3:15:15] <darkfilled> most underated star wars character is pockets imo lol.
[3:15:19] <lotharrio> Perfect Hair Forever
[3:15:25] <wantedsafe471> Yeah, the lore says the beaks of the masks have spices in it to block the poo smell
[3:15:26] <pmda2126> it's full of fecal matter but the hair looks nice
[3:15:26] <%A_German_spy> @KeiganOfAstora Seems not. Or at least, Bluepoint didn't interpret it that way
[3:15:27] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> @darkfilled woolieYE
[3:15:33] <okramv> Yeah little to no new aliens in ST, definitely missed opportunity
[3:15:44] <%RaziWraith> The wacky star wars races were the charm of the series imo
[3:15:50] <darkfilled> i miss dark side woolie!
[3:15:55] <specialpipo> weee
[3:16:03] <%krispen_wa> The Twilek being hot were the charm of the series
[3:16:20] <%krispen_wa> Aayla Secura Kreygasm
[3:16:21] <+Kinggarbage> These guys are just the dudes from oddworld lol
[3:16:24] <magnumlockjaw> I still dont see why so many people think that star wars aliens are hot
[3:16:30] <MyNameIsRasus> Why are aliens with tentacles as hair always hot
[3:16:32] <+ReallyBigRocks> I love how many weird background races from the OT got their own main characters
[3:16:38] <peachy996> No hot male Twilek because they all look like Bib Fortuna
[3:16:44] <%RaziWraith> Where do they come from? Where do they go?
[3:16:54] <%RaziWraith> Cotton-Eye Joe! Keepo
[3:16:54] <+ReallyBigRocks> @magnumlockjaw I mean the hot ones are just regular earth babes in body paint
[3:16:57] <andre11dr> @magnumlockjaw Don't forget that furries are a thing
[3:17:01] <darkfilled> i don't think star wars aliens are hot. eww!
[3:17:18] <peachy996> pff Coward
[3:17:20] <specialpipo> Either he is lying or hasn't seen enough star wars
[3:17:35] <%RaziWraith> @darkfilled blue Mass Effect aliens were much hotter. KappaHD
[3:17:38] <%hax_metatron> E X T E R N A L C O L L I S I O N S
[3:17:42] <darkfilled> i seen 1-6, that's it.
[3:17:58] <magnumlockjaw> I think its the fact that 60% of the time they are real people in costumes
[3:18:00] <darkfilled> always wanted to try mass effect tho.
[3:18:13] <%Frazzyfraznor> I always have Ludo from Labyrinth in my head in this area "smells bad!"
[3:18:20] <darkfilled> never played them.
[3:18:22] <peachy996> Mass Effect 1 is good, 2 is great but has issues near the end

[3:20:18] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> woolieMIRIN
[3:20:20] <wantedsafe471> Crazy talk almost intervened
[3:20:21] <%krispen_wa> @raziwraith yes
[3:20:33] <jackelzxaa> Wow reggies actually doing 5-2 is he?
[3:20:34] <darkfilled> i see.
[3:20:34] <%KeiganOfAstora> "Breathe from my butt"???
[3:20:36] <%krispen_wa> but mostly only change ME1
[3:20:42] <%RaziWraith> so that means more Mass Effect 3 multiplayer maybe. woolieSMUG
[3:20:46] <+ReallyBigRocks> Is butt breathing the reason this area is so gross?
[3:20:52] <%krispen_wa> No Multiplayer confirmed
[3:20:54] <%A_German_spy> @jackelzxaa He had to do it sometime
[3:20:57] <%KeiganOfAstora> Did Reggie get help from Biorr against The Penetrator?
[3:20:58] <$thomassolorio> bottles in da club
[3:21:00] <peachy996> Sadly ME3 MP is not in
[3:21:02] <darkfilled> mass effect has multiplayer?
[3:21:03] <%RaziWraith> awww :(
[3:21:09] <%X2Eliah> @KeiganOfAstora ohh ya
[3:21:09] <%ekodrop> death awaits

[3:21:15] <%krispen_wa> LUL
[3:21:16] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> yeah it was like a pve horde mode
[3:21:20] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[3:21:21] <jackelzxaa> Legendary doesnt have multiplayer but it does have major changes to update mass effect 1 that even modders couldnt make happen
[3:21:24] <CoffeeSlice> LUL
[3:21:26] <MyNameIsRasus> What a chad message
[3:21:31] <CrimsonGargoyle> LUL
[3:21:47] <%krispen_wa> LUL LUL
[3:21:47] <andre11dr> What's that one Darkest Dungeon like "Best is the weapon that cuts on its own"
[3:21:55] <%RaziWraith> Mass Effect 3 had multiplayer and it was actually fun imo. Too bad Mass Effect 3's story probably suffered for it.
[3:21:56] <%KeiganOfAstora> use a long range attack
[3:22:01] <magnumlockjaw> GUNSLINGER!
[3:22:02] <jackelzxaa> New mass effect 1 will have much better shooting and cover, which is great because it’s the best story in the trilogy
[3:22:03] <%Lion_kun> WHAT ABOUT THE ITEM
[3:22:05] <Crowroost> Stupid Idea Busta
[3:22:05] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts

[3:22:13] <+robosqueeb> long range to lure them closer?

[3:22:18] <specialpipo> do a flip
[3:22:20] <%X2Eliah> ME3 MP was legit great
[3:22:22] <%KeiganOfAstora> Mucky muck
[3:22:26] <%KeiganOfAstora> Wonderboy
[3:22:26] <magnumlockjaw> Its just three stones of ephemeral eyes
[3:22:34] <%KeiganOfAstora> What is the secret of your powers
[3:22:36] <jackelzxaa> The me3 story is having the multiplayer effect on story removed and rebalancing the war assets and points
[3:22:42] <MyNameIsRasus> Slowly, gently, this is how a life is taken...
[3:22:45] <brian_peppers1> oh no

[3:22:58] <MyNameIsRasus> BONKED
[3:23:00] <%RaziWraith> Yeah I remember trying to play Mass Effect 1 a little while ago after I already played 2 and 3. Mass Effect 1 is rough to play.
[3:23:00] <%krispen_wa> LUL
[3:23:01] <lotharrio> Won't you take me far away, from the Nasty man!
[3:23:04] <andre11dr> You miss 100% of the shots you don't take
[3:23:09] <%Deekman> lmao
[3:23:10] <jackelzxaa> Me2 and 3 are also getting big texture and shader upgrades and all dlc as just part of the game. Its gonna be a GREAT package
[3:23:13] <peachy996> Bonk

[3:23:35] <%patriotrenegade> WE DEM BOIS
[3:23:45] <magnumlockjaw> Too big?
[3:23:52] <jackelzxaa> $60 for all 3 mass effects better than they are on pc (with mod support continuing over) is worth it for sure
[3:23:59] <%RaziWraith> This squad is too big for Smash LUL
[3:24:04] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Soul Remains, Reggie
[3:24:08] <%KeiganOfAstora> PvP
[3:24:17] <darkfilled> reggie for smash anyone?
[3:24:20] <wantedsafe471> they are too HUGE for the storm ruler
[3:24:27] <%KeiganOfAstora> Soul remains are a good idea, also LITERALLY any long range attack
[3:24:27] <+robosqueeb> technically theyre bigger than human sized
[3:24:39] <%patriotrenegade> Boy it’s too bad he doesn’t have any PROJECTILES
[3:24:39] <Crowroost> Where's your tall RE Village fetish now, huh?
[3:24:40] <jackelzxaa> Reggie needs to find the tank so he can run them over, i’m surprised woolie hasnt told him where it is yet
[3:24:51] <wantedsafe471> Reggie, Use Your Bow to aggro them
[3:24:58] <peachy996> Yeah the two things that wont be in the remaster are MP because I dunno and the Pinnacle Station DLC from 1
[3:25:11] <andre11dr> LUL
[3:25:13] <lotharrio> Yeah, this game is a lot easier with the modern weaponry DLC. The infinite magnum weapon carried me.
[3:25:14] <%krispen_wa> I keep forgetting what Pinnacle Station even was
[3:25:18] <peachy996> Pinnacle Station isn't a huge loss but MP is a shame
[3:25:19] <jackelzxaa> Pinnacle station sucks but also their source files got corrupted so what can they do?
[3:25:21] <Crowroost> The Thin Brown Line
[3:25:21] <+robosqueeb> @jackelzxaa storming boletaria in a panzer felt awesome, cant believe they put that in
[3:25:25] <andre11dr> Right into that spike
[3:25:42] <jackelzxaa> MP shouldnt have been part of the trilogy it should have been its own thing
[3:25:48] <%KeiganOfAstora> oh so close
[3:25:51] <%KeiganOfAstora> that woulda been great
[3:25:56] <peachy996> Pinnacle Station in a nutshell: Shoot Holograms until you get someone's house
[3:25:59] <PanicSwytch> Does Pinnacle Station add anything important to the Story?
[3:26:04] <peachy996> No
[3:26:08] <okramv> FIREBOMB TIME
[3:26:20] <%RaziWraith> I mean technically the multiplayer had nothing to do with the story, but if you mean developed by an entirely different team then maybe.
[3:26:22] <%A_German_spy> ...He's gonna be crushed when he finds out that all that's on the island is three Ephemeral Eye Stones, though spyShock
[3:26:28] <%krispen_wa> was pinnacle station the same thing as Bring Down the Sky?
[3:26:35] <%KeiganOfAstora> Shhhh
[3:26:47] <%Axle13j> LUL
[3:26:51] <jackelzxaa> I wanted some pvp using indoctrinated forces as justification for it and some coop story missions made for multiplayer where you can pick dialog as a group (old republic mmo did group dialog well)
[3:26:55] <specialpipo> pregnat
[3:26:55] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus It's a wide radius, maybe five or six meters from where it lands.
[3:26:58] <peachy996> Bring Down The Sky is good DLC
[3:26:59] <specialpipo> prgante

[3:30:20] <Crowroost> it's a doggy dog world
[3:30:29] <%RaziWraith> Reggie only has a weapon buff equipped. He is not super invested in magic right now it seems.
[3:30:39] <jackelzxaa> Its a shame reggie doesnt have some kind of magical ability that theyre weak to
[3:30:42] <andre11dr> Also i just realized, this place must've influenced Bloodborne a little with the mad beast guys that are weak to fire

[3:47:40] <%Holycow8498> As I travel through the valley of the shadow of shit
[3:47:40] <%Javaa01> But yeah, the gimmick of this fight is that once you get the flies on you, you have to touch one of those burning corpse pyres and immolate the flies off of you
[3:47:43] <Rafraud> Make Reggie do a human form area just to see lol
[3:47:45] <brunoberserk> the true boss is the valley

[3:49:18] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Actually, this ended up being a pretty decent build, since Light Weapon doesn't scale with your Magic stat. Reggie's getting more or less the full benefit from it.
[3:49:38] <Equirah> @notsoy 27k at least
[3:49:39] <Lefteron> @HarmlessCrow it also did with Miralda but they missed it
[3:49:46] <andre11dr> What do you get from Colossus? It's the mist right?
[3:50:02] <%KeiganOfAstora> I thought Reggie put more points into Magic. Totally nevermind
[3:50:04] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Light Weapon only scales with the Magic Adjust of your Catalyst
[3:50:05] <%KeiganOfAstora> He's quality all the way
[3:50:09] <dundore77> see if you can get a straight 100 mp?

[3:50:30] <%KeiganOfAstora> DUDEUse wikidot
[3:50:31] <%Amaideus> Fextra is shit
[3:50:33] <lotharrio> Fextra life has been falling apart.
[3:50:34] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Not so much lying as it's a complicated formula
[3:50:34] <Crowroost> Magic @ "I just wanted to talk 2 Freke" levels
[3:50:42] <Lefteron> That spy is a spy!
[3:50:42] <%RaziWraith> Fextralife is kinda not always up-to-date
[3:50:45] <SilverFaustX> Playstation direct on Thursday
[3:50:52] <Blank9> Might want to grab the silver coronet armor from Thomas to have more MP.
[3:50:57] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus But yeah, this stuff can be pretty obtuse.
[3:50:57] <+Graxe_> Yeah, State of Play on Thursday
[3:50:58] <%KeiganOfAstora> @WoolieVersus Wikidot is more accurate for Demon's Souls and Dark Souls 1
[3:51:02] <%ekodrop> fextra is kinda just ng
[3:51:15] <dmtjinni> WOOLZ
[3:51:15] <dork_doggler> Fextra is garbage use wikidot
[3:51:17] <%Amaideus> Wikidot is more accurate in general
[3:51:19] <%Holycow8498> Umbasa
[3:51:29] <andre11dr> You'd think it would be hard to spy on people when your name is Soy
[3:51:31] <%KeiganOfAstora> Unfortunately Wikidot didn't keep up with DS2
[3:51:43] <%krispen_wa> BEWARE THE LIMITS OF YOUR POWER
[3:51:45] <%RaziWraith> I wouldn't say Fextra is garbage but it's definitely more about running their stream now.
[3:51:46] <%Javaa01> But can you really blame them
[3:51:52] <%Javaa01> It's DS2 after all
[3:51:52] <andre11dr> BEWARE
[3:51:53] <MyNameIsRasus> The Nameless Asshole
[3:51:55] <magnumlockjaw> "Beware of the slugs and garbage"
[3:51:58] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Not many areas left to go now
[3:51:59] <Crowroost> "These are your boys." *12 magic*
[3:52:01] <+Graxe_> Acid
[3:52:02] <MyNameIsRasus> Erased from the anals of Anor Londo
[3:52:04] <+Graxe_> Pocket acid
[3:52:17] <+Graxe_> Acid Cloud + Scraping Spear
[3:52:26] <DSD24> Reggie killed a blind old man last time
[3:52:34] <andre11dr> This spell is FUN
[3:52:40] <%notsoy> pvp trolling
[3:52:45] <LVL1_Scumbag> PVP spell
[3:52:45] <MyNameIsRasus> PVP funsies
[3:52:50] <jorniev> that asshole has to have THE WORST voic acting in the OG demons souls
[3:52:51] <$thomassolorio> pyaaaaa
[3:52:52] <%RaziWraith> This spell is "fun" LUL
[3:53:00] <Crowroost> Acid Cloud is perfect for when Ostrava is too far away to stab in the back.
[3:53:03] <wantedsafe471> Scumbag Spell
[3:53:10] <+Graxe_> That's such a thinly veiled threat
[3:53:17] <+Graxe_> "I can still be patient"
[3:53:17] <andre11dr> And then you pull out a Storm Ruler
[3:53:45] <Murdercles> just eat it
[3:53:54] <Syteal> wait she's got different spells tho... .-.
[3:53:56] <%KeiganOfAstora> Nah, just buy heals
[3:53:57] <magnumlockjaw> "Are you going to use it?"
[3:54:02] <Crowroost> !! WITCH WIFE LOST !!
[3:54:04] <+GilroyGoldBlood> Hey chat. Is there any sort of connection between Yuria the Witch and Yuria from DS3?
[3:54:09] <%KeiganOfAstora> buy a crap ton of heals so you don't have to think about it for awhile
[3:54:13] <+Graxe_> Boss spells have a little bit of lore, so I'd get them at least once
[3:54:14] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Don't attune Acid Cloud. It's useless in PvE.
[3:54:18] <%RaziWraith> I always get the spell for trophy/achievement
[3:54:19] <+Graxe_> Yeah
[3:54:20] <sendart> it has no effect outside of pvp lol
[3:54:24] <+Graxe_> It's not for PvE at all
[3:54:24] <Murdercles> actually...against Garl...
[3:54:32] <wantedsafe471> Its a pruely PvP spell
[3:54:36] <+Graxe_> What equipment are you degrading on enemies
[3:54:36] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus It does not work on NPCs.
[3:54:38] <Blank9> it's never going to work on enemies
[3:54:43] <magnumlockjaw> !REGRET!
[3:54:46] <+robosqueeb> It's so dumb that it doesnt effect enemies
[3:54:49] <%Grimlockfly> he should check out Fire Storm
[3:54:49] <%mihokspawn> @GilroyGoldBlood yes they are made by the same game devs... But actually no.
[3:54:51] <%Ecchigun> !REGRET!
[3:54:52] <+robosqueeb> It's acid FFS
[3:54:56] <Syteal> firestorm though
[3:54:57] <BurdRightsActivist> !REGRET!
[3:55:06] <+Jiggisnipe> just go back to 4 for souls LUL
[3:55:10] <sendart> isn't it sad *harp twang*
[3:55:11] <wantedsafe471> !REGRET!
[3:55:15] <magnumlockjaw> Hey Maiden, wanna try some of the the good shit?
[3:55:23] <peachy996> Funny how Poison works good against you but if you want to make a good poison build good luck
[3:55:25] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus This spell has no effect on anyone but human players
[3:55:36] <brunoberserk> works against old king doran ?
[3:55:38] <%krispen_wa> Degrade and humiliate players
[3:55:43] <Johannen> Wouldnt 4-3 yield more souls then Ritual path?
[3:55:46] <bobxmaker> wools, i think it's faster going to storm ruler boss room and just swipe some mantas out of the sky, get a ton of souls for them
[3:55:49] <%A_German_spy> @brunoberserk Nope
[3:55:55] <magnumlockjaw> Fart gas!
[3:55:55] <+Jiggisnipe> fart gas
[3:55:56] <LVL1_Scumbag> eww smelly
[3:55:57] <andre11dr> There is some spells that are exclusively for pvp ,like acid cloud, vanish ,soul suck
[3:56:01] <Crowroost> break their shit quickly
[3:56:11] <magnumlockjaw> It even sounds horrible
[3:56:18] <wantedsafe471> i thought soul suck worked on enemys
[3:56:28] <Syteal> it does
[3:56:41] <%A_German_spy> @wantedsafe471 Soulsuck does. We're talking about Acid Cloud
[3:56:43] <peachy996> Also looking frightened
[3:56:48] <andre11dr> Oh ,i did not know that
[3:56:50] <peachy996> As he should
[3:56:54] <dundore77> prince of persai-esque

[4:29:35] <NeonBleu> greed
[4:29:35] <%patriotrenegade> Its his first time through
[4:29:36] <%Juriasu> it's fine guys
[4:29:40] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Does tendency really matter? Its the same ending
[4:29:40] <%Irridium> what happened is what everyone does their first time
[4:29:45] <jorniev> you basically killed a nun reggie
[4:29:59] <Rafraud> ! WOOLIE AT RISK !
[4:30:00] <+cvp5127> maybe use words next time
[4:30:02] <%hax_metatron> Show this to him https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-OkRFmmSr0
[4:30:15] <brunoberserk> this is great
[4:30:16] <linSP> he died twice that’s -2, and he got the boss that’s +1 so it’s not pure white anymore
[4:30:17] <%Lion_kun> there are special white and black events
[4:30:22] <%Aztec50> They don't?
[4:30:26] <Crowroost> oooh Elden Ring
[4:30:32] <Rafraud> WT was fine lmao
[4:30:44] <%hax_metatron> Reggie went too far ahead
[4:30:46] <%Lion_kun> he'll need to grind pvp to bring it up now
[4:30:49] <NeonBleu> blocking your way
[4:30:49] <+Graxe_> He blocks your path
[4:30:49] <%Javaa01> @BallerSwagBro9k Tendency affects Vinlands sister existing
[4:30:52] <+Jiggisnipe> he's supposed just block the path
[4:30:52] <%mihokspawn> @WoolieVersus the Thiefs ring happened
[4:30:56] <Rafraud> Yeah him being down there was not Woolie witholding info game just fucked up
[4:30:59] <+necrocannibal2> he bugged at bit
[4:31:00] <redrins> he got fed up with reggie going right Kappa
[4:31:03] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus What happened is that if you go right, he moves down into the swamp to guard her
[4:31:10] <+Graxe_> Yeah, that
[4:31:10] <vnzuelandude> Reggie basically destroyed Garl like a chump he didnt even register what he was
[4:31:11] <Johannen> Reggie went too far on the right
[4:31:12] <%Axyias> He’ll go down if you go right
[4:31:16] <linSP> he can’t get pvp, he killed all bosses, world tendency can’t go higher this NG
[4:31:16] <+Graxe_> If you go to the swamp, he goes down
[4:31:29] <andre11dr> She doesn't
[4:31:30] <%Deekman> she does NOT die in 1 hit lol
[4:31:39] <DSD24> She has Wrath of God I think
[4:31:39] <+Graxe_> She's a DPS check
[4:31:42] <+Jiggisnipe> yea lol she can "fight"
[4:31:45] <+Graxe_> She
[4:31:47] <+Jiggisnipe> yep she has a spell
[4:31:49] <%Amaideus> So why is his world tendency in 1-X not pure white now?
[4:31:49] <%A_German_spy> @linSP You can do PvP in those areas in the remake if you have a password active
[4:31:51] <Darren716> I'm making a bet right now, Reggie is gonna merc Priscilla in DS1 when he gets to her
[4:31:52] <+Graxe_> 'll use Wrath of the Gods
[4:31:59] <+Graxe_> And stack regens on herself
[4:32:00] <Rafraud> Idk if we can still max it?
[4:32:03] <jorniev> if you kill her first he kills himself
[4:32:07] <%Deekman> @WoolieVersus she won't die in 1 hit and she'll use an AoE spell on you
[4:32:07] <andre11dr> You get more dialogue if you swing,and it's actually way sadder
[4:32:15] <%A_German_spy> @Amaideus Because he died in that area in body form
[4:32:17] <Crowroost> Its inhabitants kind
[4:32:17] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1364103397230718976?s=19
[4:32:26] <Rafraud> Its 1 off
[4:32:30] <+Graxe_> Reggie died twice in body form
[4:32:31] <%Amaideus> When did he die in Boletaria as a human?
[4:32:39] <%jepupu> Beating a boss gives 1 death's worth towards white.
[4:32:42] <BlackermanZX> eh you can max it other ways right
[4:32:43] <%Deekman> @WoolieVersus turn on a password and get someone in that world for him to kill and it'll go back up
[4:32:47] <+Graxe_> Each body death lowers it, but a boss kill negates one death
[4:32:48] <Rafraud> Theres no more bosses in area
[4:32:52] <shadowcrisis> Silverhand
[4:32:53] <+Jiggisnipe> 2
[4:32:58] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Yeah, he had one death worth of leeway
[4:32:59] <%hax_metatron> Only body deaths count
[4:33:02] <andre11dr> @amaideus He killed Miralda
[4:33:14] <%Amaideus> Killing Miralda brings it down too?
[4:33:18] <%Amaideus> God I hate WT
[4:33:21] <andre11dr> Yes
[4:33:31] <+Graxe_> NPC deaths also bring down WT
[4:33:33] <BlackermanZX> you can do the password thingy to het full white right
[4:33:34] <Rafraud> ! WT AT RISK !
[4:33:36] <Johannen> Wasnt a glitch, he just went too far on the right
[4:33:37] <%A_German_spy> @Amaideus Yeah, killing her moves it toward black
[4:33:37] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Yeah that fight is a buggy mess
[4:33:50] <DSD24> His shield is really cool
[4:33:54] <%Amaideus> Well that explains it, thanks
[4:33:57] <+Jiggisnipe> I don't think it was a glitch, he just got to the bottom so it moved Garl
[4:34:12] <Rafraud> @WoolieVersus He'll still be there Reggie can go fight
[4:34:13] <+GilroyGoldBlood> Garl's armor is always my go to
[4:34:23] <Rafraud> The game fucked up lol
[4:34:24] <sendart> reggie went after the shiny thigns
[4:34:27] <Johannen> Game didnt bug out
[4:34:28] <Murdercles> it didnt bug
[4:34:32] <andre11dr> We should still be able to se Doran is he kills some dragons
[4:34:36] <bobxmaker> didn't bug, thief ring
[4:34:40] <brunoberserk> Woolie : REEEEEEEE
[4:34:45] <Rafraud> OH LMAO

[4:35:22] <$BallerSwagBro9k> GROOSE THEME
[4:35:26] <%cobalt_phoenix_> reggie no it's ok fr
[4:35:26] <Rafraud> @WoolieVersus maybe you can show him a video of the scene?
[4:35:26] <Johannen> I dont think THief Ring has anything to do with it, Reggie just went too far on the right
[4:35:26] <pmda2126> I didn't know that
[4:35:29] <bobxmaker> no big deal, this is reggies first, this is exactly how it should be.
[4:35:32] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus No, it wasn't the Thief Ring. It was because Reggie went right instead of left from the entrance. If you go right, Garl retreats toward Astraea. It's all the same, though. He got the dialogue
[4:35:36] <OldManDeckardCain> groose theme better be playing during this part, minh LUL
[4:35:41] <jorniev> YOU SHOULD FEEL BAD
[4:35:43] <Crowroost> Listen all y'all it's a sabotage
[4:35:47] <andre11dr> And we got to actually hear to theme
[4:35:56] <+Jiggisnipe> Garl moves to protect Astraea I think
[4:36:04] <+NYCrownlessKing> german says its not the ring @WoolieVersus
[4:36:05] <%KeiganOfAstora> Nah no worries
[4:36:11] <%megaman_sentinel> thief ring op
[4:36:29] <+NYCrownlessKing> "It was because Reggie went right instead of left from the entrance. If you go right, Garl retreats toward Astraea. It's all the same, though. He got the dialogue" @WoolieVersus
[4:36:31] <%krispen_wa> tldr BOSS IS FUCKED
[4:36:38] <Equirah> a bug with the thief ring :v
[4:36:42] <andre11dr> He's set is really cool
[4:36:56] <redrins> his set is "fuck magic" the character
[4:37:02] <Johannen> THe Ghost of Crazy Talk still lingers within Woolie
[4:37:05] <DSD24> Killed the shit out of that dood and now wear his set
[4:37:18] <+GilroyGoldBlood> I want to just bend over and bull rush someone with the top of his helmet
[4:37:45] <DSD24> @GilroyGoldBlood Or just do a sick headbutt
[4:37:53] <+GilroyGoldBlood> Wait, I thought he did drop his weapon
[4:37:59] <%megaman_sentinel> hero?
[4:38:00] <+GilroyGoldBlood> does he not?
[4:38:15] <fruit_pie_the_magician> That dude looks like Ricky from Trailer park boys
[4:38:17] <andre11dr> You get it from him right?
[4:38:19] <wantedsafe471> Do you feel like a hero?
[4:38:23] <Murdercles> i mean, someone doesnt need to be strong or even fight to be evil
[4:38:24] <DSD24> She had blood on her clothes
[4:38:27] <linSP> Reggie is the coolest guy
[4:38:28] <Johannen> @GilroyGoldBlood I think his Phantom drops it
[4:38:35] <+GilroyGoldBlood> ah makes sense
[4:38:42] <%krispen_wa> I mean if she was single handedly dooming the world she had to go
[4:38:43] <scrublordsamurai> the biggest hero
[4:38:44] <andre11dr> She was eating those guys souls
[4:38:48] <%Cozy90> Such honor killing that person who didnt want to fight you
[4:39:01] <Crowroost> You've tried Fat Evil, now try Church Evil.
[4:39:03] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> "person" she was a demon
[4:39:04] <%KeiganOfAstora> What's that "become demon" bit about? @A_German_spy
[4:39:09] <bobxmaker> this is actually not bad.
[4:39:11] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus This one DOES affect PvE enemies
[4:39:16] <DSD24> Cause she liked helping people
[4:39:32] <%krispen_wa> Is Freke the voice of Aldia?
[4:39:32] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:39:39] <+Graxe_> She took in all of the Valley's suffering and corruption within herself
[4:39:46] <wantedsafe471> USELESS
[4:39:50] <%A_German_spy> @KeiganOfAstora She started off human, but became a demon after realizing what Freke tells you about the clerics' "god"
[4:39:51] <+Graxe_> And became the most corrupted of them all
[4:40:10] <%krispen_wa> damn she looked fiiiiine
[4:40:11] <LongJackSilver> Ardyn did nothing wrong
[4:40:14] <+necrocannibal2> Astraea :(
[4:40:20] <+robosqueeb> I mean, a corrupted demon would be good yeah? like a corrupted good would be bad
[4:40:24] <%krispen_wa> oh god she is just ardyn
[4:40:24] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> well, minus the fetuses, but y'know
[4:40:30] <%KeiganOfAstora> Pat's favorite weapon
[4:40:30] <+Graxe_> Aw yeah, the Blueblood Sword
[4:40:33] <%Deekman> @Gallhint and she wears hats on her feet
[4:40:36] <heartlesshealer> corrupted of demons
[4:40:41] <brunoberserk> pat's favorite weapon
[4:40:44] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> the GOODBLUD sword
[4:40:45] <linSP> lucky ted’s favorite weapon
[4:40:49] <%A_German_spy> @KeiganOfAstora Except she interprets it as God abandoning her, whereas if you believe Freke, the thing she was worshipping was never God to begin with, but the Old One
[4:40:50] <heartlesshealer> love wording
[4:40:52] <MyNameIsRasus> LUCKY REG
[4:40:57] <lotharrio> Ted's blade?
[4:41:01] <wantedsafe471> Lucky Ted recommends This sword
[4:41:03] <brunoberserk> LUCK & PLUCK
[4:41:04] <andre11dr> Blue Blood, has the best damage of any straight sword
[4:41:20] <+MisleadingEchoes> @andre11dr homo swords are better tho
[4:41:20] <%Javaa01> And Luck as it would have is ENTIRELY broken in this Remake, because oopsie Gold Coin
[4:41:22] <Lefteron> Lucky Tedd build when?
[4:41:26] <+Graxe_> Luck is the most human trait
[4:41:32] <+logoth_> "Hoh BOY"
[4:41:55] <BlackermanZX> lucky reggarth
[4:41:59] <wantedsafe471> Blueblood Sword + Light Weapon = Destroyer of Worlds
[4:42:01] <andre11dr> What was the DS3 equivalent called again?
[4:42:08] <linSP> everything at zero but luck at 50
[4:42:12] <jorniev> LUCK GLITCH MAKES IT AWESOME
[4:42:20] <Rafraud> INFINTE LUCK
[4:42:20] <%A_German_spy> @andre11dr Anri's Straight Sword
[4:42:21] <+robosqueeb> wasnt it the hollow sword? mor-something or another
[4:42:25] <%Deekman> @WoolieVersus don't forget about the coins
[4:42:28] <+GilroyGoldBlood> @jorniev Luck glitch got patched in remake
[4:42:32] <%Amaideus> Morion Blade is something else
[4:43:25] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Does the Filthy Woman still wear Astrea's clothes or did Bluepoint mess it up?
[4:43:32] <linSP> the only way you’d know if blueblood sword exists is if you had her soul and a broken sword when you talked to ed
[4:43:37] <+Graxe_> Anri's Straight Sword is the DS3 version, but you could upgrade any weapon into luck scaling
[4:43:40] <LongJackSilver> And look where it got them

[4:46:42] <pmda2126> do you have to?
[4:46:43] <%Jetzord> FOR THE GREATER GOOD
[4:46:49] <mdkcde> "You're still a good man, Reggie"
[4:46:53] <wantedsafe471> Yeah, you can kill Astrea first and garl commits suicide in depression
[4:46:56] <dinnydanny777> I can't believe the game doesn't let you choose not to kill her Kappa
[4:47:06] <mdkcde> You're still a good man
[4:47:08] <peachy996> Fuck mercy, I gotta make Progress
[4:47:12] <MyNameIsRasus> What's next? Killing puppers? The elderly?
[4:47:19] <Mr_Zero5232> I remember when Woolie was first told about that
[4:47:23] <+CarlosEoM> you know what i mean
[4:47:26] <NeonBleu> with his body blanket
[4:47:34] <ashuckel> good job reggie
[4:47:44] <wantedsafe471> "You have a heart of pure gold, don't let the demons take it from you"
[4:47:48] <+datmegamandeeeee> Oh no, i missed it
[4:47:56] <andre11dr> Oh don't worry, at least the next Archdemon is A HUGE ASSHOLE
[4:48:00] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> That Astrea is a fake. It's a Demon that tricked Garl Vinland into protecting it. The real Astrea is the Filthy Woman merchant.
[4:48:02] <Belakitu> Can you progress if you decided not to beat that zone?
[4:48:18] <%cobalt_phoenix_> wait I forgot, why exactly are we hunting for demons souls again?
[4:48:26] <heartlesshealer> I still appreciate body blanket. He just let them throw their bodies on him as they finally succumbed in their last moments near Astrea
[4:48:34] <heartlesshealer> or pulled them on for warmth
[4:48:39] <%ekodrop> damn reggie

[4:49:28] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh right
[4:49:37] <andre11dr> @cobalt_phoenix_ To get to the Old One ,and than you get the choice to kill the old one, or absorb all the souls to become The Biggest Demon
[4:49:47] <JeoDood> some kid told me too
[4:49:49] <%Deekman> don't feel bad, if she's allowed to live the world will literally end
[4:49:50] <%megaman_sentinel> good guys lol

[4:50:38] <+cluckme_arse> do the thihng baby do do the thinggggg
[4:50:52] <magnumlockjaw> The true bug was the disease we picked up along the way
[4:50:59] <OblivionSword1> at the end of the day everything is fine
[4:50:59] <+GilroyGoldBlood> @WoolieVersus Don't forget to reequip the Cling Ring
[4:51:04] <%cobalt_phoenix_> cling ring
[4:51:04] <andre11dr> Or i don't think you actually kill the Old One, i think you technically just send him back to sleep
[4:51:15] <dundore77> couldn't he blue phantom once or twice?
[4:51:23] <+Graxe_> Gonna have to kill some bosses or invaders
[4:51:23] <+GilroyGoldBlood> He remembered :)
[4:51:29] <%Deekman> @WoolieVersus do some multiplayer with chat!
[4:51:34] <%ekodrop> can just find people to kill online
[4:51:39] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus I can help expedite those lengths, if it comes to it. Just give me a shout if you need.
[4:51:58] <OblivionSword1> what spy said above
[4:52:12] <magnumlockjaw> Reggie must absorb the souls of his fellow man to succeed
[4:52:22] <linSP> time to invade Reggie live on stream?
[4:52:23] <supergoblinpunch> just kill an invader
[4:52:30] <$BallerSwagBro9k> T H E B LA C K
[4:52:33] <magnumlockjaw> @WoolieVersus Even if he does that he needs one boss alive
[4:52:45] <%RaziWraith> Wait have they been losing tendency? I don't recall Reggie dying in human form.
[4:52:45] <+Graxe_> You don't necessarily need to kill the primeval demons, but that can help
[4:52:46] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus That will only get you to one level below Pure White. You still need to kill one invader after you use the "slingshot" technique
[4:52:49] <$arcielardor> INVASION TIME
[4:52:50] <andre11dr> Could just someone some people for some duels
[4:52:57] <dinnydanny777> is that a poop waterfall
[4:53:02] <LunarRemix> He only appears on pure white
[4:53:06] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus He would have been in his normal spot
[4:53:08] <pmda2126> who wants to invade and sacrifice themselves for the LP?
[4:53:09] <+necrocannibal2> a little bit back
[4:53:09] <%ekodrop> @A_German_spy might as well dm him
[4:53:11] <+Graxe_> Pure white
[4:53:11] <%Lion_kun> pure white only
[4:53:26] <+Graxe_> Pure black is phantom Selen on her island
[4:53:49] <%A_German_spy> @ekodrop I'm going to, but I don't see them interrupting the stream for that. We'll deal with it later if Woolie wants.
[4:53:49] <%Lion_kun> do some invasiond
[4:53:49] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:54:06] <OblivionSword1> Spy can help too make it pure white again @WoolieVersus
[4:54:08] <%ekodrop> for sure
[4:54:14] <%Lion_kun> can't invade a zone with no bosses
[4:54:25] <%A_German_spy> @ekodrop Yeah, I can invade and Reggie can kill me a few times
[4:54:34] <andre11dr> You can summon Black Phantom
[4:54:53] <+Graxe_> Oh yeah, red signs
[4:55:00] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Yeah, as long as you have a password active, you can be invaded here
[4:55:00] <magnumlockjaw> Could Reggie be summoned by someone else?
[4:55:06] <%cobalt_phoenix_> man people weren't kidding when they said world tendency sucked
[4:55:12] <+Graxe_> But would it be possible because all the bosses are dead
[4:55:13] <%megaman_sentinel> password
[4:55:16] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Discord
[4:55:20] <linSP> beat spy up for the greater good
[4:55:34] <peachy996> Makes you appreciate all the sols games who got rid of that WT shit
[4:55:34] <wantedsafe471> THE GREATER GOOD
[4:55:38] <andre11dr> I know Spy won't Storm Ruler Reggie off a cliff, BUT WAT IF THO
[4:55:40] <%Deekman> passwords don't stop invasions by others
[4:55:44] <OblivionSword1> training dummy spy
[4:55:45] <MyNameIsRasus> Spy saves the playthrough once more!
[4:55:47] <%RaziWraith> I remember trying to do this the backwards way. Go all the way to pure black and then kill the black phantom NPC and primeval demon for pure white.
[4:55:48] <lotharrio> Be naked, Spy.
[4:55:57] <lotharrio> Franz, I believe in you!
[4:56:02] <%RaziWraith> That's kinda rough not gonna lie

[5:25:15] <BlackermanZX> maybe grass is a true hero's reward
[5:25:19] <redrins> since you like munching grass that much
[5:25:19] <pmda2126> Reggarth was truly defiled, at least his purity

Hey considering that the netcode for Guilty Gear strive is so good that anyone can pretty much play anyone else in the world whenever they want, Do you think this might finally be the anime game that is not dominated by Japan?

[5:27:43] <andre11dr> @cherryceecee I think yea

[5:29:10] <%mihokspawn> @andre11dr DS3 is the least bad one, because you have movefast daggers
[5:29:29] <%mitchteck> Blight town is the best one
[5:29:37] <+cvp5127> LUL
[5:29:43] <yuribo26> I never been so disappointed by reaching a boss
[5:29:43] <%krispen_wa> DS3 still takes forever to get through even with quickstep
[5:29:54] <%Javaa01> Or at least try to make it so that you actually have to sort of think about doing the gimmick in the Golem fight
[5:29:57] <CrimsonGargoyle> the bed of chaos of des LUL
[5:29:59] <+datmegamandeeeee> Dark souls 1 swamp rules cause it’s small

[5:30:20] <%Juriasu> can't wait for latria
[5:30:23] <%A_German_spy> @Prattlesworth Yeah, Woolie told him
[5:30:31] <+cherryceecee> the fact that the master key lets you skip most of blighttown is why its the best
[5:30:38] <andre11dr> Well about that
[5:30:46] <%krispen_wa> oh if he does Latria last then spoiler man wont be a problem anyways
[5:31:01] <hazeprojekt> gotta face old king dolan
