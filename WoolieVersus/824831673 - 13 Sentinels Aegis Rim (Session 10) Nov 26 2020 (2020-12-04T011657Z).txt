[0:00:59] <%wardogleader15> Congrats on the play button!
[0:01:00] <MyNameIsRasus> one step forward two steps back
[0:01:01] <%Th3SmartAlec> One step closer to flushing out the Empty Lot
[0:01:07] <MyNameIsRasus> do it do it DO IT
[0:01:14] <atravelbee> Yakuza!!!!!!!!!!!
[0:01:18] <atravelbee> YEEEESSSSSSS
[0:01:21] <%Irridium> speaking of Yakuza Like a Dragon is fuckin' sick
[0:01:21] <%bread_assassin> Yooooo
[0:01:26] <+MetroidPrimeRib> continuing adventures of a single scene recontextualizing the entire game again
[0:01:30] <%X2Eliah> Super hyped for Yakuza tbh.
[0:01:31] <%BlueJoneleth> baka mitai
[0:01:38] <atravelbee> @Irridium I hope it wins game of the year, like a dragon was soooooo good
[0:01:46] <MyNameIsRasus> Dame dame moments incoming
[0:01:52] <socratetris> amae na
[0:01:57] <%bread_assassin> So is Yakuza gonna be with Little V and not Reggie?
[0:01:59] <OfficerMods> u ain't ready
[0:02:00] <%gatorafan> Reggie Souls tho
[0:02:10] <MyNameIsRasus> dudebros gonna be dudebros
[0:02:15] <CappuccinoGuil> @gatorafan he doesn't have a PS5 tho LUL
[0:02:18] <socratetris> Yakuza V and Reggie Souls sounds good
[0:02:18] <%wibbwobbler> bad cod, good sci fi
[0:02:21] <MyNameIsRasus> reggie souls is gonna be so good
[0:02:33] <+MetroidPrimeRib> the mp was also terrible
[0:02:37] <%X2Eliah> @WoolieVersus Hey Woolie so what happened with your PS5, did it get bricked or what?
[0:02:43] <+MetroidPrimeRib> that's a big part
[0:02:46] <%Irridium> @atravelbee honestly for me 13 Sentinels is my GOTY but Yakuza is easily #2
[0:02:47] <%Th3SmartAlec> It would have been better received if it wasn't called "Call of Duty"
[0:02:49] <%FuqBoiSlim> The multiplayer was ass tho wasn't it?
[0:02:53] <%Wool> gobble gobble
[0:02:55] <CaptainBright> With 13 Sentinels and Yakuza 7 racing to be GOTY candidates, Matt's tweet is rapidly aging very, very poorly
[0:02:56] <socratetris> @x2eliah he didnt get one yet
[0:03:00] <OfficerMods> cod wants boomtown current year edition
[0:03:03] <+BigBruthaThunda> cod fans want GREY
[0:03:05] <+BigCoffee> people come to call of duty to eat the same peperoni pizza every year, constantly, forever, with no creativity
[0:03:08] <%X2Eliah> From his twitter I thought he got one
[0:03:09] <+BigCoffee> except for modern warfare
[0:03:11] <CappuccinoGuil> @CaptainBright what was the tweet?
[0:03:12] <+BigCoffee> infinite*
[0:03:12] <%FuqBoiSlim> Like people buy cod for the mp and if thats ass then its useless to them
[0:03:18] <OfficerMods> boom town is great so who can blame them
[0:03:19] <socratetris> I didnt see that update then XD
[0:03:23] <pixel_river> Id still be really interesting if woolie ever tried cod4, probably not happening though
[0:03:29] <%Razputin217> Not enough brown and gray, 3/10
[0:03:36] <+Amaideus> I refuse to buy CoD or any annualized franchise specifically because it feels like there's a hard time limit on how much fun I can enjoy with it before it dies
[0:03:36] <MyNameIsRasus> end of the shooter arc
[0:04:14] <%gatorafan> We enter the crime arc (we never left)
[0:04:14] <OfficerMods> @amaideus yakuzi doe

[0:05:07] <jorniev> i miss old battlefront 2
[0:05:09] <+Amaideus> Not for any reason, I just haven't ever bought one or wanted to
[0:05:51] <jorniev> BALCK OPS 3 aparently was terrible and i didnt even know 4 existed
[0:06:00] <%wibbwobbler> tru
[0:06:00] <%X2Eliah> Myeeeeah, Call of Duty audience does not care for sci-fi.
[0:06:08] <%Irridium> 4 was the Multiplayer Only one. lol.
[0:06:14] <jorniev> really
[0:06:30] <socratetris> No new thing, only new old thing, but dont be new or old
