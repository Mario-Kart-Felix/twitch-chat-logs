[0:05:53] <%yeknomlive> they're new v skills
[0:05:55] <AustinApa> G is the same he ever was and thats exactly the way he needs to be
[0:06:11] <Solidnick18> it's been free a few times
[0:06:16] <Overhaul180> @artificiallynatural Generally more defensive tools like dodges and parries or installs like making a move better
[0:06:35] <Tucker0603> I just want my lady Seth...
[0:06:42] <Overhaul180> Or in some cases safe pressure enders like Kage and Ken
[0:06:43] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> G is now Q
[0:06:46] <C_Ranked> Woolieeeeeeeeeeee
[0:06:53] <+ggbhtg> Abigail got dem Discount Tire Company combos @woolieversus
[0:07:08] <+michingmallecho> Netcode: why they don’t want me man😞

[0:07:16] <boxofhooligans> Ooo, I see, playing some screet fighter!
[0:07:26] <%BrooklynAI> projectile divekicks
[0:07:27] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Guile V skill 2 is actually hella unsafe
[0:07:29] <OldManDeckardCain> That Time I Reincarnated as Guile Who Can Throw Sonic Booms in the Air
[0:07:30] <Keero_orphen> woolie look like he's in pajamas
[0:07:32] <AustinApa> G and Q link to the real life Q
[0:07:34] <+dramajoe> sideways sonic boom looked so stupid
[0:07:53] <jushido_brown> Jimmy loves that cheap shit
[0:07:56] <jushido_brown> i'm here for it
[0:08:01] <+michingmallecho> Sonic cross is still cool but air fireball GivePLZ
[0:08:07] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Cheap shit is the best shit
[0:08:21] <%KingLlama1> is woolie wearing ahegao pants ?

[0:08:29] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> no
[0:08:31] <+McSoliace> cheap shit is fun when it's universal
[0:08:33] <MutedMimic> DansGame
[0:08:40] <+2DSuperiority> mrrobo4Naaaa ahegao pants
[0:08:42] <+ggbhtg> Why is there still only ONE SUPER
[0:08:46] <+michingmallecho> anitaS
[0:08:50] <NotHereToStream> cr mk
[0:08:50] <Solidnick18> ehhh
[0:08:50] <AustinApa> also if anybody wants to play my G my CFN is Dingodice
[0:08:59] <Saberkai> ed got them hands
[0:08:59] <Overhaul180> There's as little daylight between tiers as there's ever been in the game, even moreso than S4
[0:09:03] <%jinking79> Ryu vskill did nothing for him
[0:09:09] <Jaku2011> Woolie looks like a tree
[0:09:11] <+ggbhtg> HOW is there still ONLY ONE SUPER?
[0:09:13] <SomersaultJustice> ryu's vskill 2 should be a fake fireball
[0:09:16] <OldManDeckardCain> HIGH RISK
[0:09:16] <+michingmallecho> Ryu is not back. He’s just peeking behind the akuma shoulder
[0:09:17] <+ggbhtg> HOW SWAY
[0:09:23] <RipVanWinkler> yeyeyeye
[0:09:26] <boxofhooligans> Kolin, and Necalli got some cheap new V Skills.
[0:09:32] <Dao_Puppy> Ryu is still 10% of the picks, does he really need buffs that will make him 15 or 20% of the matches played?
[0:09:42] <+Deko_> cr.mp hype
[0:09:44] <%CaptainPileDriver> TIRE JUGGLES
[0:09:47] <Crashfan01> That's your punishment for maining stale bread Ryu
[0:09:54] <+Polter_ge1st> Ryu needs Air Fireballs
[0:09:55] <Arek_1> LK Tatsu (sometimes MK Tatsu)juggles after EX Donkey Kick for good oki.
[0:10:01] <Zayasu> abigail is top tier again :(
[0:10:05] <OldManDeckardCain> and Menat reminds us Rose will never make it TearGlove
[0:10:08] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @ggbhtg
[0:10:09] <%CaptainPileDriver> GILL HAS A BETTER PARRY THAN RYU @WoolieVersus
[0:10:12] <+CaptainPyron> Juri can charge a stationary fireball. Kappa
[0:10:13] <Solidnick18> that would make him to good
[0:10:15] <+Milpool> Its abig deal!
[0:10:17] <+ggbhtg> Imma yell Moo
[0:10:19] <+zanzibar_junker> Ryu can combo Tatsus again
[0:10:21] <%jinking79> Gill took the Real Parry
[0:10:24] <Overhaul180> Gill has to choose high or low
[0:10:29] <Overhaul180> That's the tradeoff
[0:10:30] <NotHereToStream> gill has to block high and low while ryu can block both
[0:10:31] <+ggbhtg> Imma YELL for da BELLE TIRE
[0:10:34] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus GILL IS PLUS ON PARRY UNLIKE RYU
[0:10:38] <AustinApa> @woolieversus G IS A FREEMASON AND Q IS QANON
[0:10:43] <boxofhooligans> Ryu needs fake Fireball animation like SNK LUL
[0:10:47] <Arek_1> Cancel cancel recovery frames.
[0:10:56] <Solidnick18> lol
[0:10:56] <JaseAdrift> They are afraid to give Ryu anything cool
[0:10:56] <Arek_1> Can cancel*.
[0:11:05] <+ggbhtg> Anti Ryu Fighter 5
[0:11:11] <JaseAdrift> which is why evil ryu exists
[0:11:12] <AustinApa> G really is a freemason though
[0:11:21] <+royebaty> The old gods fear daigos ryu
[0:11:22] <Overhaul180> Unironically replace Ryu and Ken's functions and put them in Sakura and Sean, make Ryu and Ken the Gouken and Evil Ryu of SF6
[0:11:24] <AustinApa> the Square and compass is right there on his chest
[0:11:28] <+UnbreakableDoof> I demand Twelve and/or Necro in SF6
[0:11:28] <%jinking79> in the Beta he was
[0:11:31] <Jaku2011> But why do you parry
[0:11:33] <+ggbhtg> Mr. Fundamentals, AND NOTHING MORE
[0:11:34] <+zanzibar_junker> Ryu should be the boss of SF6
[0:11:37] <+RenoDeGeneric> Oh man a good jumping LK, top tier character
[0:11:39] <%Uulyaoth> twelve? gross
[0:11:43] <AustinApa> a freemason symbol that usually has G right in the middle of it
[0:11:50] <%jinking79> Ryu was scary in the Beta

[0:23:32] <+TheBesteban> Yeah, this was made for their breakdance competitions. Red Bull has a whole circuit for those
[0:23:39] <neet98> that Gill costume is banned right?
[0:23:45] <+TopTieramisu> this pyro costume has so much going on
[0:23:46] <+dramajoe> did you see how far that cr mk hit
[0:24:13] <Ianrazz> That Ryu costume is so bad. The only choice for Ryu is Hot Ryu
[0:24:15] <BlackOrchidKI> I un-ironically love that costume for Ryu so much LUL
[0:24:19] <gruff_gridof> back HK is a good anti air
[0:24:21] <Arek_1> I think they got rid of the Red Bull markings on this and Chun-Li's costume and just gave them SFV markings.
[0:24:21] <manolotanaka> b hk is also a good antiair if they try to cross you up
[0:24:21] <+TheBesteban> Gill has an ice kick that AAs better than the elbow
[0:24:35] <biomegabear> pyron never looked better

[0:25:23] <SomersaultJustice> quite literally a walking volcanic rim
[0:25:24] <%ChoculaUltra> the swirling aura is a bit much
[0:25:26] <Guntanks_in_Space> hell that talk of "a darkstalkers game that never happened" is present with Seth
[0:25:29] <+Superbro64> the effects here in sfv are quite obnoxious though
[0:25:31] <dreamin_17> probably where they got the Demitri costume from too
[0:25:33] <Guntanks_in_Space> he has a lot of Demitri's shit

[0:25:56] <+TopTieramisu> yes, i'd like a dark souls 4 :)
[0:26:04] <pillowwasp> Real flightiers should shout the names of their moves

[0:26:10] <big_v5> darkstaker trademark got renewed resonantly
[0:26:10] <%MayorRev> Why are they advetising SFV in SFV
[0:26:12] <%CaptainPileDriver> i literally forgot about the music and had to go through and set them
[0:26:13] <Arek_1> @CaptainPileDriver All 4 of the tracks are from DMC4, but yeah.
[0:26:21] <%CaptainPileDriver> fair enough
[0:26:23] <+TopTieramisu> how resonantly?

[0:30:38] <Div_the_Penguin> LUL
[0:30:43] <+TopTieramisu> wth was capcom thinking when they came up with necalli's story
[0:30:47] <%LordSDB> Necalli is the best thing that came from SFV for me. ill miss him in SFVI
[0:30:51] <%gatorafan> We do combo
[0:30:52] <JaseAdrift> They werent thinking

[0:30:59] <+hod_fareview> SSJ
[0:31:02] <Guntanks_in_Space> remember when Necalli was built up to be this big threat
[0:31:07] <+TopTieramisu> @lordsdb he was jobbed harder than kotal
[0:31:08] <Guntanks_in_Space> but then loses to getting dick punched
[0:31:09] <+i_zombee> niiice
[0:31:16] <+hod_fareview> @Guntanks_in_Space and he turned out to be a total jobber
[0:31:18] <+TheotherKristian> Those are some thick pants
[0:31:21] <SomersaultJustice> one hit combos 4 life
[0:31:35] <neet98> are we doing vomit third strike
[0:31:38] <%LordSDB> @toptieramisu. I know. 😤
[0:31:42] <Guntanks_in_Space> like Ryu just learns the Shinkuu Cock Destroyer Punch and nut punches Necalli lol
[0:31:43] <%MayorRev> this is a really good costume for chun li woolieYE
[0:31:49] <+Justanotheryoutuber> Necalli always felt like he was supposed to be the main villain for SFV but they back-peddled on that and just threw in Bison instead
[0:32:03] <+TopTieramisu> necalli even has a damn V design on his body
[0:32:09] <beefomkers> Neither of these characters look anything like what they're supposed to
[0:32:16] <+TopTieramisu> he was totally the main baddie at some point
[0:32:16] <Bpbranmuffin> Reggie doesnt confirm shit. He always follows thru with combos even on block. Like a real man Kreygasm
[0:32:19] <+hod_fareview> slam dunk, thank you punk
[0:32:21] <neet98> because Necalli is boring
[0:32:25] <Solidnick18> barf the barf
[0:32:28] <+TopTieramisu> but they got rid of that shit
[0:32:31] <%gatorafan> The question is, does Capcom has the balls to advance the series timeline past 3?
[0:32:37] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> God this Necalli costume is so sick
[0:32:45] <beefomkers> @gatorafan No
[0:32:45] <Guntanks_in_Space> @bpbranmuffin Reggie commits so hard. You can't hate that
[0:32:46] <fuji_92> 20% > 80%
[0:32:57] <neet98> past 3 Cody killed everyone in the roster
[0:33:03] <%ChoculaUltra> I wonder how many times Necalli's VA had to record the barf sound
[0:33:04] <$Thorn14> I dont recognize these characters
[0:33:05] <+TopTieramisu> @gatorafan even sf3 was a copout with them bringing back the shotos and eventually chun

[0:33:35] <%LordSDB> @neet98. Cody kills the Camcop universe?
[0:33:52] <neet98> @lordsdb he can
[0:33:57] <beefomkers> Please take into account that there are exactly 0 Street Fighter games that canonically take place in either of the two previous decades
[0:34:00] <neet98> give him time
[0:34:10] <SomersaultJustice> the vskill 1 combo is different now from s1, it doesn't combo into stomps
[0:34:16] <+High_Tide> These costumes are crazy
[0:34:23] <@Squdnate> Daigo vibes from that super
[0:34:24] <beefomkers> Advancing the timeline past three would put Ryu in his fifties

[0:37:06] <DensityD> yes, they are hard to recognize, but surely you can admit that this Necalli looks SICK AF
[0:37:13] <@Menitta> man it's been ages since I played this
[0:37:14] <DensityD> get hype
[0:37:15] <+bootysteve> You could have told me that was c. viper and I would have believed you
[0:37:19] <+TopTieramisu> @bootysteve how else will they come up with triple digit costumes for chun?
[0:37:20] <@Menitta> gonna grab Luciw
[0:37:24] <@Menitta> Lucia*
[0:37:40] <Ianrazz> Im the totally oposite @bootysteve Leather daddy Bison, Vergil Cody and Hot Ryu are fucking POG dude
[0:37:42] <+razielhex> @bootysteve Your account name betrays you. You know it to be false.
[0:37:43] <%CaptainPileDriver> woolie, when you do the forward slash dive, do the light version after the stomp, that should combo i think
[0:37:54] <DensityD> buttons are designed to be pressed ;)
[0:37:57] <%ChoculaUltra> Hot Ryu is the GOAT of all SFV costumes. Don't @ me.
[0:37:57] <dmysta3000> Honestly I wouldnt mind if the Red Bull Chun-li costume was actually for Laura
[0:37:58] <floralkami> wow, this looks fun to play again
[0:38:16] <Smileyhat> So are we for glory or for fun today?
[0:38:19] <DensityD> are you going to sit there and tell me that I shouldn't press the buttons that have the functionality of being pressed :P
[0:38:30] <DensityD> *stares in yomi*

[0:41:21] <SomersaultJustice> tiger ghost
[0:41:23] <%gatorafan> Why doesn't the tiger get a costume?
[0:41:24] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> YO thats a sick costume
[0:41:30] <Solidnick18> TIGER
[0:41:34] <+Killsteal_Wolf> TIGER
[0:41:35] <@Menitta> the Gold UI is so garish
[0:41:41] <Kristoffers> I love the roar on the projectile
[0:41:51] <SomersaultJustice> JAGGLE
[0:41:53] <$SilverRoddo> Chun Li? More like Chun OL
[0:41:54] <DensityD> playing the projectile game against Sagat LUL LUL LUL
[0:41:56] <AustinApa> its not garish when you realize ots because G is one making the UI
[0:41:57] <chll0ne> big ASS
[0:42:01] <Guntanks_in_Space> remember that SF The Movie arcade did the Tiger Shot Roars before lol
[0:42:03] <BlackOrchidKI> @Kristoffers It's been there since forever, and I love it always.
[0:42:04] <AustinApa> its all for G
[0:42:06] <+Javaa01> TIGGER
[0:42:11] <+razielhex> I like the old school Thailand stage.
[0:42:14] <+hod_fareview> TIGER'
[0:42:19] <+chaumiester> This is the first time I'm seeing this game. Chun-Li's ankles look like they would be in so much pain with her stances in heels
[0:42:22] <%Running_Sets> When's El Fuerte?
[0:42:24] <DensityD> rocket boot
[0:42:25] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Sagat VS 2 is good
[0:42:29] <jerkhov_> cr m under the highs
[0:42:31] <+Troispoint> they brought zoning back with S5 tbh
[0:42:31] <+TopTieramisu> does G have any proper story yet or is he just the crazy guy that thinks he rules the world?
[0:42:36] <Ianrazz> My teacher is doing spinning hard kicks when i arrive late on class
[0:42:36] <+shadowmoonsama> Guile tho
[0:42:39] <+tearfuldevil> question, does woolie have a sub discord?
[0:42:45] <Clinnamon> G is a top tier youtuber, it's canon
[0:42:47] <DensityD> good advancement
[0:42:47] <@Solidus_113> no
[0:42:48] <AustinApa> all the important story is implied
[0:42:49] <dragonify_> @TopTieramisu G is a youtuber
[0:42:49] <%gatorafan> I'm pretty sure it's the later.
[0:42:50] <+MTLer> @dualities i concur
[0:42:54] <Kristoffers> @TopTieramisu crazy mysterious world guy
[0:42:56] <DensityD> that's super hard to do
[0:42:56] <Aydarkzero> is Sagat Sigma?
[0:42:56] <AustinApa> for starters G is a freemason
[0:42:58] <clapbeat> @TopTieramisu gill says he feels familiar
[0:43:00] <+ggbhtg> Instead Ryu is bad Kappa
[0:43:06] <+TopTieramisu> so G is basically Ganryu LUL
[0:43:07] <+hod_fareview> @TopTieramisu people speculate G is Gill and Urien's long lost brother and that he later on becomes Q.
[0:43:10] <jrglz90> hey woolie wie war dein tag?
[0:43:12] <+emperordread> scrub quote or hot take: Zoning is for people who don't want to actually play fighting games
[0:43:19] <%Running_Sets> I'm so sad I missed out on Woolie's SFIV stream. I wanna body him on Fuerte
[0:43:23] <DensityD> I'm going to keep arm chair EVO-pro'ing over here
[0:43:25] <DensityD> don't judge
[0:43:28] <+Troispoint> @emperordread what do you think
[0:43:28] <mrpandabear437> thats a scrubqoupte
[0:43:29] <AustinApa> G is the representation of God in Man
[0:43:29] <DensityD> except me Kappa
[0:43:32] <clapbeat> thats a big scrubquote
[0:43:33] <faqmachine> definitely scrub quote
[0:43:33] <+dramajoe> scrubquote
[0:43:35] <artificiallynatural> scrubquote
[0:43:38] <AustinApa> he's fullof occult and esotericreferences
[0:43:41] <%gatorafan> @emperordread, just wait your turn manesi1Velfeelsgood
[0:43:46] <@Squdnate> @emperordread Scrubquote
[0:43:46] <Jaku2011> Scrubquote
[0:43:48] <+emperordread> lol yes it was taken from scrub quotes
[0:43:52] <+emperordread> you all win
[0:43:54] <jrglz90> hey freunde kann ich mitspielen?
[0:43:55] <+TopTieramisu> that's a scrub quote. and i wouldn't be suprised if it was from plauge
[0:43:56] <+TopTieramisu> plague*
[0:43:58] <Serge_12> This is FOR FUN or FOR GLORY?
[0:44:00] <clapbeat> even if it wasnt from the accound
[0:44:06] <clapbeat> thats still a scrubquote
[0:44:17] <Guntanks_in_Space> definitely a scrubquote
[0:44:19] <AustinApa> G is looking to brainwash people to fight the illuminati
[0:44:24] <%Running_Sets> FOR GLORY it feels like
[0:44:26] <%LordSDB> For fun
[0:44:28] <AustinApa> its meant to be a mirror of what Qanon is
[0:44:30] <%BrooklynAI> the confirms
[0:44:30] <+BallerSwagBro9k> @serge_12 FOR FUN but as usual it becomes FOR GLORY
[0:44:34] <%yeknomlive> plagues scrubquotes was about dbfz inputd
[0:44:38] <jrglz90> jetzt ne runde street fighter wäre echt mega
[0:44:38] <+emperordread> personally I don't play zoner characters, but that's just my style
[0:44:42] <+Troispoint> that's the easiest confirm in the game lol
[0:44:44] <Serge_12> ahh okay thanks lol
[0:44:47] <+Ellila> What in gods name is that Zangier skin?
[0:44:48] <Arek_1> @TopTieramisu "But I don't wanna do a quarter-circle motion." LUL
[0:44:52] <AustinApa> @worthwhile_off scroll up
[0:44:52] <+Ellila> Sagat*
[0:44:56] <RipVanWinkler> FeelsBadMan
[0:44:56] <jerkhov_> For fun because nobody’s playing abigail Kappa
[0:44:58] <+TopTieramisu> i'm pretty sure plague has had several scrubquote level zingers
[0:44:59] <Louie_Salmon> Man this outfit is horny
[0:45:01] <Solidnick18> FeelsBadMan
[0:45:03] <AustinApa> read what i said
[0:45:04] <%Running_Sets> @emperordread Morrigan/Doom throws that scrubquote directly into the trashcan.
[0:45:04] <fuji_92> 0% > 100% WIN RATIO PogChamp
[0:45:06] <+shadowmoonsama> Woolie broke this man
[0:45:07] <chll0ne> BIG AAA
[0:45:08] <SomersaultJustice> you need to steal their soul to replace your first soul
[0:45:09] <Bennett_Fracture> if you ain't zoning... you ain't trying...
[0:45:09] <chll0ne> ASS
[0:45:20] <+DrJamesWoods> That outfit is way too hott to be in this game
[0:45:25] <+DrJamesWoods> Sagat Makes the PP hard
[0:45:26] <JaseAdrift> Reggie got that streak
[0:45:41] <Guntanks_in_Space> @DrJamesWoods hiding the scar makes it even more sexier
[0:45:46] <+Javaa01> @louie_salmon Basically ALL of Chunners costumes in this are horny as hell
[0:45:52] <Guntanks_in_Space> also this is Reggie's redemption after he got 5 Gs in Samurai Shodown lol
[0:45:53] <+emperordread> I like traditional footsies instead of blazeblue style stuff like making swords appear all over the stage
[0:45:58] <+TopTieramisu> some of chun's costumes are confusing
[0:45:59] <jerkhov_> This matchup is in chun’s favor but he doesn’t know the ways to get in
[0:46:00] <DensityD> is it good footsies or bad footsies? IDK but I see empty footsies....
[0:46:01] <Ianrazz> I wish Chun Li was my teacher back in the day
[0:46:02] <+emperordread> that's also why I love DiveKick so much
[0:46:02] <+DrJamesWoods> @Guntanks_in_Space Kreygasm
[0:46:09] <DensityD> when do I open my 3rd eye and see beyond?
[0:46:13] <+hod_fareview> Yo, whaddup my Zona?
[0:46:13] <Guntanks_in_Space> macawGasm
[0:46:23] <+full_st0p> Watching this make me want to go back and play SF4
[0:46:44] <DensityD> lets play Street Fighter Series X
[0:46:46] <+DrJamesWoods> Watching this makes me wanna open Sagat's third eye
[0:47:02] <DensityD> that's a better naming convention, right guys?
[0:47:04] <+dramajoe> shimmy
[0:47:08] <%Running_Sets> I super wanna run SFIV sets.
[0:47:08] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:47:09] <+Troispoint> Jimmy doing the wrong juggles
[0:47:18] <NotHereToStream> couldn't kara cancel
[0:47:21] <DensityD> Juggles doing the wrong Jimmy
[0:47:25] <@Menitta> @dualities you missed it boi
[0:47:30] <%Running_Sets> I AM AWARE
[0:47:37] <+Troispoint> he could tiger knee reliably instead
[0:47:52] <@Menitta> you wanna play 4 later?
[0:47:57] <%Running_Sets> Absolutely
[0:48:03] <+Troispoint> the optimal stuff for Sagat is annoying to pull off consistently
[0:48:04] <Ognjenco> Give us Cyberbots 2 CAPCOM! dnoplsGREEN
[0:48:09] <@Menitta> let's go post stream
[0:48:10] <%Running_Sets> or 5, or 3S. I just wanna play a street fighter dude.
[0:48:26] <uncledoodsauce> where's ja?
[0:48:34] <fuji_92> dang
[0:48:35] <%Running_Sets> I'd *really* love to play MvC2 but apparently that's impossible outside of PS3/360
[0:48:35] <AustinApa> i'll play you in 5 @dualities
[0:48:36] <+TopTieramisu> YAS
[0:48:41] <+dramajoe> st lk ftw
[0:48:44] <+Troispoint> you can also juggle VT 1 into itself if it's for the kill
[0:48:49] <+Azero_Tehiro> Yas king, slay!
[0:49:02] <jerkhov_> Is that Ray Charles in the back
[0:49:07] <Bennett_Fracture> the one in 21 - 1...
[0:49:11] <%CaptainPileDriver> man, that tire is super great for big damage with abigail
[0:49:29] <DensityD> what's the fight stick cleaning/sanitization routine?
[0:49:43] <+dramajoe> reggies dp punishes LUL
[0:49:44] <+razielhex> using their tongues
[0:49:44] <DensityD> what if I have christmas cookie crumbs on it?
[0:49:48] <Guntanks_in_Space> Sanitary Wipes for me, or something with isopropyl alcohol
[0:50:00] <+hod_fareview> @Guntanks_in_Space likewise
[0:50:01] <Guntanks_in_Space> if you have a blower or an air can take that to your arcade stick too lol
[0:50:10] <jerkhov_> Easier than keyboard cleaning by a lot
[0:50:12] <+razielhex> just bought an electric vacuum/blower
[0:50:32] <Guntanks_in_Space> i actually have an electric blower that i use for my PC, i sometimes put my stick on that shit lol
[0:50:42] <+TopTieramisu> glad they added fahkumram to sfv :)
[0:50:44] <TheNewJapanGuy> Howdy
[0:50:48] <+razielhex> shit's loud but goddamn does it work
[0:50:58] <Guntanks_in_Space> what the fahk @TopTieramisu :)
[0:51:00] <Zayasu> HahaCat HahaCat HahaCat
[0:51:16] <DensityD> @WoolieVersus Happy Boxing Day! Joyeux lendemain de Noël!
[0:51:17] <jerkhov_> I want to fahkumram secretary chun
[0:51:19] <Guntanks_in_Space> but wait, does Sagat have a family to protecc
[0:51:24] <DensityD> HahaGingercat HahaGingercat HahaGingercat
[0:51:28] <Guntanks_in_Space> i mean there's the orphans and his pet tiger...
[0:51:30] <Clinnamon> who else is gonna take care of the tiger
[0:51:35] <%Running_Sets> He fights for his entire nation
[0:51:36] <+BallerSwagBro9k> Is it easier to play fighting games with an arcade stick or controller?
[0:51:38] <SomersaultJustice> JAGGLE
[0:51:44] <DensityD> this way?
[0:51:58] <%ChoculaUltra> @BallerSwagBro9k its preference, really.
[0:51:58] <jerkhov_> @ballerswagbro9k personal preferences no real answer
[0:52:00] <Clinnamon> he's always complaining about his tiger's knee, someone needs to get the cat to a vet
[0:52:01] <+dramajoe> you tryin to fireball war, with a king
[0:52:04] <%Running_Sets> @BallerSwagBro9k it SUPER depends on the game and how you hold controllers
[0:52:07] <Civet10> @ballerswagbro9k its mostly preference
[0:52:10] <Arek_1> @DensityD If your lever on your arcade stick has a shaft cover and two dust washers (one outside, one inside), nothing should get inside your stick.
[0:52:10] <fuji_92> dang gg my bro
[0:52:12] <DensityD> the zone flowchart
[0:52:13] <+razielhex> @BallerSwagBro9k Woolie did an entire series of videos about this
[0:52:21] <%ChoculaUltra> SAGAT DAMN
[0:52:22] <+hod_fareview> Welcome to the zone zone
[0:52:26] <+TopTieramisu> tezuka zone
[0:52:26] <%yeknomlive> @ballerswagbro9k some things are easier on either. honestly tho arcade sticks wont make you automatically better
[0:52:28] <%Running_Sets> I enjoy arcade sticks so much I'll play Wipeout on one
[0:52:31] <Solidnick18> oh no
[0:52:35] <jerkhov_> Don’t let me into my zome
[0:52:38] <Guntanks_in_Space> @BallerSwagBro9k whichever you're more comfortable with tbh. whichever controller that lets you play long sets without your hands cramping up is the best
[0:52:40] <@Squdnate> Full Kayne Westin' it
[0:52:43] <shryoc> The zone zone LOL
[0:52:45] <Ianrazz> @BallerSwagBro9k For me it depends on the game, MK11 is easier for pad and SFV is a must on arcade stick for me
[0:52:55] <Bennett_Fracture> that was ytv the zone...
[0:52:58] <Kyopheonix> It cant be the Zone Zone.....not enough tentacles xD
[0:53:00] <$SilverRoddo> Get in the zone, AUTO-ZONE.
[0:53:02] <Guntanks_in_Space> also yea arcade sticks won't make you better, but if you played in an arcade before it almost feels right at home lol
[0:53:04] <+ggbhtg> Zone Archives, LIVE
[0:53:07] <+shadowmoonsama> You have to be in a dojo
[0:53:11] <jerkhov_> I’m definitely in my zone
[0:53:18] <SomersaultJustice> you have to be in a dojo
[0:53:19] <gruff_gridof> you have to set it up on the capcom fighters site
[0:53:21] <Arek_1> You gotta join or make a dojo.
[0:53:26] <+razielhex> hahaha, what's the point in giving the temperature of the area?
[0:53:26] <+hod_fareview> Dojo casino... It's all in the mind.
[0:53:31] <+dramajoe> you need to go on the capcom site, and join or make a dojo
[0:53:33] <SomersaultJustice> pick the beach Kappa

[0:55:27] <Graxe_> Electric Nergigante
[0:55:29] <Solidnick18> LUL
[0:55:31] <DensityD> and his Sonic dedication
[0:55:32] <Graxe_> New variant
[0:55:33] <Guntanks_in_Space> it would have been the perfect fit

[0:55:38] <%CaptainPileDriver> god this costume
[0:55:41] <Solidnick18> new sub species
[0:55:41] <KgKid51> this stage theme is fucking banger
[0:55:49] <OldManDeckardCain> HIGH RISK
[0:55:53] <NeroInfinite> Whats going on WITH BLANCA
[0:55:54] <NotHereToStream> guile you have an AR on your back, it probably do more dmg then your boom Kappa
[0:55:57] <DensityD> HIGH NOISES
[0:55:58] <jerkhov_> Tower of Babel?
[0:56:04] <+razielhex> BACKBREKKA
[0:56:05] <Clinnamon> I think blanka's nergi costume came out before they rajang to world, so nergi was the better promotion for MH
[0:56:23] <DensityD> excuse you, it is Street Fighter, not Street Gun Fighter
[0:56:30] <Guntanks_in_Space> look man
[0:56:34] <+DoctorDerp388> always be flashin
[0:56:41] <Guntanks_in_Space> the gun on guile's back is INFERIOR to his already-present two guns
[0:56:48] <Guntanks_in_Space> NO BLANKAGIGANTE, NOT THE HEADBITE
[0:56:50] <Solidnick18> pinned
[0:56:54] <DensityD> THE MONSTER HAS ME PINNED!
[0:56:57] <NotHereToStream> well give that gun to ryu at the very least, he needs it most
[0:56:59] <EnderGamma> jump sonic boom is super negative
[0:56:59] <Graxe_> When's the Teppen Nergigante subspecies coming
[0:57:01] <+doe3879> Damn, I'm not a fan of how the game do skins
[0:57:05] <%CaptainPileDriver> the fact that you can charge the shout of earth is so fucking great
[0:57:08] <+hell_spoon> @Guntanks_in_Space points for the HEADBITE
[0:57:13] <ChinMusicTwo> is that the m16 sonic boom variant ?!!?
[0:57:25] <+dramajoe> empty jump cr jab

[0:58:35] <+razielhex> man guile's a fukken beast
[0:58:43] <+hod_fareview> I just used my points for kirby
[0:58:48] <%CaptainPileDriver> guile is gonna be top 5 easily with this v-skill
[0:58:49] <fist_wizard_jay> Honestly, I know Nergigante was the flagship monster for MHW and all, but this outfit for Blanka should have been Rajang
[0:58:58] <fuji_92> Woolie here training to beat daigo's guile LUL
[0:59:08] <DensityD> this is guile bringing his full sleep/ paralysis armor set, and bully Nergigante with rocks and toads
[0:59:08] <+BallerSwagBro9k> I anyone is Interested in playing Soul Calibur 6 or Killer Instinct send me a FR on Steam. Same name than here
[0:59:13] <%CaptainPileDriver> this v-skill allows some long combos that lead to stun or just stupid huge damage
[0:59:42] <+razielhex> slap
[0:59:45] <akast07> LUL
[0:59:46] <Clinnamon> split the difference and give laura a sexy rajang costume

[1:02:09] <Guntanks_in_Space> "we're not here to flash kick, we're here to sonic boom"
[1:02:19] <fuji_92> well that's because...
[1:02:24] <NotHereToStream> they were busy making chun li costumes thats why
[1:02:24] <DensityD> once, there was a Guile the Soldier. now, there is only Guile the Sonic Boom Canon
[1:02:30] <+DoctorDerp388> karin sleeping face
[1:02:31] <Clinnamon> by next game, his booms will have evolved to throw their own tiny booms

[1:03:04] <NotHereToStream> GGGG
[1:03:04] <TheArrow_> I completely agree. That's why I play Rashid :)
[1:03:05] <%gatorafan> That single empty spot on the right triggers me. daedra1DerpyTibs
[1:03:05] <DensityD> oh wow, E. Honda in 5 gets a nose job and kissable lips
[1:03:06] <$BSplitz> best girl karin
[1:03:06] <+Superbro64> karin, lili, ingird, etc. take your freakin pick doodSinwata
[1:03:06] <+ggbhtg> She finally came back, and RUINED THE GAME LUL

[1:03:26] <NotHereToStream> also reduced dmg
[1:03:27] <DensityD> MAXIMUM PRESIDENT
[1:03:29] <spawnzie> MAXIMUM PRESIDENT
[1:03:30] <%CaptainPileDriver> karin and rashid are the two characters that i hate playing against, but karin is just boring to watch.
[1:03:33] <Solidnick18> the world president
[1:03:34] <adamisfruit> Karin is just a super ResidentSleeper
[1:03:35] <+mighty_max_t> It also gives armor, I think?
[1:03:42] <DensityD> PJSalt
[1:03:42] <Civet10> also vives you damage reduction
[1:03:45] <+razielhex> Yoisssshoooo
[1:03:52] <fuji_92> TAUNT AS G, THE FULL ONE PogChamp
[1:03:57] <DensityD> any PJSalt that E. Honda has is honorable salt
[1:04:04] <%mzrx7> @mighty_max_t nah, 10% defense buff that stack per v-skill activation up to 3
[1:04:07] <%yeknomlive> that'll do pig
[1:04:12] <Arek_1> Damage and stun reduction. 10%, 20%, and up to 30%.
[1:04:15] <%mzrx7> but you lose it on knockdown
[1:04:19] <BabyNaBackbrace> G. looks like a werewolf on an English Fox hunt
[1:04:21] <+hod_fareview> It's funny how pre-release everyone was hype for Karin and now they just hate her guts.
[1:04:24] <DensityD> slap
[1:04:24] <fist_wizard_jay> Real talk, G is hands down my all around favorite character in SFV

[1:05:25] <Solidnick18> what that do
[1:05:28] <DensityD> at least his wrist
[1:05:29] <+Azero_Tehiro> G's V-Skill II can be done three times
[1:05:31] <%yeknomlive> Mike is playing ganryu now
[1:05:33] <BabyNaBackbrace> Woolie sporting that "Cream of Broccoli" sweater. I wanna throw croutons at your goddamn shirt bro!

[1:07:43] <%yeknomlive> it's become tradition
[1:07:43] <+razielhex> G gonna catch these hands
[1:07:44] <DensityD> better than wake up breath
[1:07:47] <adamisfruit> G’s second V skill has multiple mechanics. It prevents loss of Presidency for one knockdown, and each “taunt” gives a 10% defense buff for a total of 30%. The same as Q’s taunts
[1:07:48] <DrBeanie> a madman
[1:07:49] <+DoctorDerp388> 🤡
[1:08:02] <Arek_1> G's VS2 offers a defense and stun reduction. It can be done up to 3 times for 10%, 20%, and 30% off. It also protects his Presidentiality Gauge during knockdowns.
[1:08:10] <DensityD> stall the installs
[1:08:10] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:08:18] <Clinnamon> G's VS2 should've been called 4 more years
[1:08:19] <+hod_fareview> @adamisfruit So instead of beating around the bush Capcom decide to run a chainsaw through it.
[1:08:26] <%Running_Sets> When's Woolie gonna work with Gootecks

[1:10:48] <+knowyourenemy_97> hmmmm
[1:10:50] <baronblank> man, I am looking forward a lot to sf6, cause there are a lot of characters in this game I wanna play, but I don't really wanna play sf5
[1:10:53] <ElPlasa> YOOOOOOOOOO
[1:10:55] <Solidnick18> PogChamp
[1:10:59] <+Tydemore> check moi ce crew de scrubs
[1:11:03] <Kalinflip> Who dat?
[1:11:04] <%CaptainPileDriver> MASH THOSE BUTTONS WOOLIE
[1:11:12] <dragonify_> Stand!!
[1:11:13] <Personified134> wait the nero costume has THE STAND????
[1:11:14] <%Irridium> alright that nero costume is pretty good
[1:11:22] <Kalinflip> atpCap
[1:11:22] <DensityD> 6th dimensional dempsey ROOLLLLLLLLLLLL
[1:11:24] <Kyopheonix> hey just getting into reading frame data for fighting games, (Tekken 7 in my case) Anyone (couch or chat) have any pointers or advice that would help?
[1:11:26] <Personified134> guys do I have to buy sf5 now
[1:11:35] <%yeknomlive> btw cody gets vergil
[1:11:53] <+GalacticaPhanto> just wait until championship edition
[1:11:54] <dragonify_> And Ken gets Dante
[1:11:54] <Zerud> and who's dante?
[1:11:56] <Smileyhat> baronblank Problem with that is SF6 will undoubtedly start with a smaller roster. So unless the characters you want to play are like Ryu or Ken there's a decent chance they won't be there.
[1:12:12] <DensityD> who was ED's favorite muppet from Sesame Street?
[1:12:14] <Smileyhat> I missed the @ because I'm dumb.
[1:12:16] <SuckPuppet> too bad they used the worst Lady costume in this game
[1:12:18] <DensityD> 123 the count 123
[1:12:18] <%yeknomlive> ken dante cause of course rueben voices both
[1:12:21] <KgKid51> oof
[1:12:22] <%CaptainPileDriver> @Smileyhat if they bring back literally any grappler i'm pretty much good for myself personally
[1:12:28] <Graxe_> As broken as it was, I do miss the Blanka time stop bug
[1:12:29] <+RenoDeGeneric> @Kyopheonix remember, negative doesn't mean bad. Punishable is bad, but even then good moves can be punishable.
[1:12:31] <+razielhex> 1991 baby
[1:12:33] <+PeopleOfTheLand> But you aren't walking like Menat!
[1:12:38] <@Menitta> Ed is fuckin weird man
[1:12:55] <+JakeSG> @Kyopheonix if you see a move in tekken that's -9 or less than it's safe. and a move that's -15 is launch punishable which is a big deal
[1:13:04] <DensityD> fuckin man is weird Ed
[1:13:04] <wyanwunt> hey woolie you still have a link to the super best friend podcast on your twitch. plz remove i still hurts :(
[1:13:19] <+razielhex> Weird, Ed is fukken man
[1:13:23] <%Hacerous> dis man..
[1:13:25] <Smileyhat> @CaptainPileDriver Well, you're probably good there. Gief is almost as essential as Ryu or Ken to a base SF roster, at least in my eyes.
[1:13:29] <+knowyourenemy_97> Ed is pretty tight
[1:13:30] <+BurkeBigsby> actin like you aint getting command grabbed atpCarl
[1:13:31] <DensityD> BibleThump it still hurts
[1:13:32] <Kalinflip> @Kyopheonix Movement is Just as important as frames , Even with strong pressure tools you should still know how to out maneuver your opponent
[1:13:57] <KgKid51> fight me!
[1:13:58] <TheactualDiepod> jimmy bones is always so pleased with himself
[1:14:08] <+Troispoint> Ed has mad ''spoiled child crying at the mall for the video game he wants'' energy
[1:14:13] <dawnks> who does woolie play in this
[1:14:18] <Smileyhat> My favorite characters in this game have been Kolin and Lucia. Probably neither of them making it into SF6.
[1:14:25] <DensityD> Edergy
[1:14:27] <%CaptainPileDriver> @Smileyhat yeah but i hate gief in this game cause fuck getting in with him is such a pain in the ass, like, i legit miss green hand, give me t-hawk or hugo or hakon, give me a grappler with more options than gief in this game
[1:14:34] <+razielhex> damn yooooooooooooouuuuuuuuuuuu
[1:14:36] <Kalinflip> @Kyopheonix What chars do you main
[1:14:45] <DensityD> Damn your fight money
[1:14:49] <+PeopleOfTheLand> Hooooorrrryyyy sheeeeet!
[1:14:58] <%Hacerous> LMAO

[1:16:38] <ElPlasa> @TheNewJapanGuy you're thinking of zoomers
[1:16:41] <+GalacticaPhanto> I had to switch to Abigail because it was the natural choice instead of Birdie for me
[1:16:43] <+violet_city> of course millennials know what linkin park is that was literally part of their generation
[1:16:49] <ElPlasa> @DensityD water
[1:16:49] <%CaptainPileDriver> @TheNewJapanGuy they do since millenials were the ones born in the 80's and 90's and anyone from 1997 i think and later is a gen x

[1:17:52] <Kalinflip> @Kyopheonix Ahh I got you So you already know that back 3 , standing 4, ff 2 down back 4 are all pretty good oppressive moves

[1:30:12] <Solidnick18> don't worry about it
[1:30:12] <+eanscrale> It's a very literal translation
[1:30:14] <+trippersigs22> fuckoff woolz Laura is a queen
[1:30:14] <fuji_92> she's acting like a real brazilian speaking English @woolieversus
[1:30:15] <+razielhex> translation vs. localization @WoolieVersus

[1:30:42] <%Running_Sets> She's all about presentation not her content
[1:30:44] <+TheBitingIrish> Having a nice rack and ass doesn't exempt her from using improper grammar
[1:30:49] <bigshedman> Laura rubbing her ass is the way that she starts the fight quickly
[1:30:52] <@Squdnate> Thot police here

[1:33:18] <Kalinflip> I see all
[1:33:22] <%ChoculaUltra> is there an official costume that gets rid of Kage's horn and underbite thing going on yet
[1:33:25] <supahrob64> THE VFX WutFace
[1:33:26] <Zayasu> why this costume WutFace
[1:33:26] <hamahiroyuki> gill, or as I like to call him: tododroki pillar man
[1:33:27] <Dao_Puppy> Kind of hope woolie invests in a compressor at some point....
[1:33:29] <Magicferret> The worse costume in street fighter right here
[1:33:35] <P0wderedT0astMan> and you thought the Nero costume was to distracting.....
[1:33:43] <@Squdnate> who dis horny looking fella
[1:33:45] <SomersaultJustice> I can play an awful menat lol
[1:33:45] <Nekros4442> God....I love watching Arturo's offensive as fuck Dhalsim
[1:33:47] <bigshedman> Yo we doing Darkstalkers again?!
[1:33:47] <Nekros4442> It's amazinfg
[1:33:49] <Smileyhat> I'll come in with my main but I'm bad at the game anyway.
[1:33:51] <adamisfruit> Pyron costume is best
[1:33:54] <Macfine> its a little busy...
[1:33:57] <floralkami> isn't Dhalsim dead?
[1:34:02] <guymontag0> There are worse looking costumes, but Gill’s Putin is easily the worst in a competitive setting
[1:34:02] <Smileyhat> That Pyron costume is the coolest shit
[1:34:06] <Kalinflip> he right there @floralkami wym
[1:34:07] <Blackscience91> First time i ever got a game. Was fun but super nervous.
[1:34:07] <P0wderedT0astMan> A LITTLE?????
[1:34:08] <Kalinflip> Kappa
[1:34:08] <guymontag0> @floralkami no
[1:34:15] <SuckPuppet> how can you see what he's doing
[1:34:16] <spawnzie> Was about to say he looks like cinder
[1:34:17] <KgKid51> Gill theme Kreygasm
[1:34:20] <+Qsmash_> but that's just Pyron. He always looks like that
[1:34:21] <+mighty_max_t> This theme RULES
[1:34:23] <clapbeat> he is also like KI in that its hard on my eyes
[1:34:23] <P0wderedT0astMan> He might as well turn into a Lazershow
[1:34:30] <Kalinflip> I like the trailer theme more
[1:34:31] <Saltmeisterr> SourPls
[1:34:33] <DensityD> is this colorblind mode compliant?
[1:34:36] <Kalinflip> Oh wait this is the trailer theme
[1:34:47] <SomersaultJustice> I like this theme but I wish his new gen theme was in too
[1:34:59] <adamisfruit> peppeJAMMER
[1:35:00] <Arek_1> Kinda weird that Gill didn't get his robes as a costume.
[1:35:19] <P0wderedT0astMan> he has a toga
[1:35:19] <floralkami> @arek_1 pretty sure he does
[1:35:21] <guymontag0> @arek_1 Urien has it for his Gill costume
[1:35:26] <%CaptainPileDriver> v-skill 1
[1:35:28] <%CaptainPileDriver> wait
[1:35:31] <Dao_Puppy> Wait, did he rant about choosing the new shit and then get VS1?
[1:35:31] <clapbeat> ex moves
[1:35:32] <%CaptainPileDriver> i mean v-trigger 2
[1:35:32] <floralkami> oh
[1:35:33] <%mzrx7> v-trigger dependants
[1:35:34] <%ChoculaUltra> I think the robes are his story costume unlock, no?
[1:35:34] <SuckPuppet> is Sethany in the game yet?
[1:35:34] <@Squdnate> Does Gill still has his diapers as a costume?
[1:35:36] <%mzrx7> dependant*
[1:35:38] <%CaptainPileDriver> v-trigger 1
[1:35:40] <DensityD> Animal House Toga Toga Toga Toga
[1:35:41] <$BSplitz> its trigger
[1:35:45] <Arek_1> Yeah, toga. Not robes. Yeah, Urien got the robes.
[1:35:45] <JINcredible1> his VS changes based on the trigger
[1:35:45] <%CaptainPileDriver> each v-trigger is a different
[1:35:48] <%CaptainPileDriver> 1 is fire
[1:35:50] <%CaptainPileDriver> 2 is ice
[1:35:52] <$BSplitz> fire is trigger 1
[1:35:55] <xiccy> Whichever VTrigger is what element
[1:35:57] <DensityD> pick the Iblis trigger LUL
[1:35:58] <Smileyhat> @WoolieVersus Getting ice meteor vs fire meteor depends on which trigger you have
[1:36:08] <@Menitta> I want Gill in a suit like Urien
[1:36:13] <KgKid51> this character is sick
[1:36:20] <%ChoculaUltra> they have casual wear Gill which is hilarious to see

[1:36:23] <P0wderedT0astMan> @squdnate Its a ceremonial banana hammock.
[1:36:25] <guymontag0> @squdnate It’s his default cause Gill’s too sexy for clothes
[1:36:41] <@Squdnate> Good. Diaper Gill best Gill
[1:36:45] <DensityD> cmonBruh

[1:37:25] <fruit_pie_the_magician> That's how it is on this bitch of an earth
[1:37:26] <+razielhex> @ChrisM341 Smashing is why R. Kelly was in trouble to begin with.
[1:37:33] <Manwad> these bloodborne crows
[1:37:33] <CuteChallenger> I'm pretty sure those are ravens
[1:37:37] <+shadowmoonsama> Crows are huge tho
[1:37:38] <deviljhojho_> oh shit
[1:37:40] <Arek_1> @WoolieVersus Never seen a raven?

[1:37:43] <WhiskeyRB> SERAPHIC WING
[1:37:45] <TheArrow_> I hope that crow is playable in sf6
[1:37:46] <WhiskeyRB> gg friends
[1:37:46] <ChrisM341> @razielhex LUL
[1:37:46] <studleydoorite> that's a raven, they get that big here in Colorado
[1:37:47] <%ChoculaUltra> yo winged Pyron is a strong ass look
[1:37:47] <alrobot2014> AngelThump
[1:37:48] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Yeah dude crows are fucking big
[1:37:50] <floralkami> Ravens are big
[1:37:50] <KgKid51> harmony is returned
[1:37:51] <hamahiroyuki> MEGIDOLAON
[1:37:51] <ThespianBarrage> I saw a crow last year, I thought it was a dog. WHY are they that big!?
[1:37:54] <NotHereToStream> remember, gill killed epstein Kappa
[1:37:55] <%yeknomlive> they're that big in alaska
[1:37:56] <%LordSDB> @chrism341 R Kelly is not for good lil boys and girls
[1:37:59] <%blaccbird914> ow my eyes
[1:38:13] <Kyopheonix> tmw Gil is actually. ot that bad of a guy
[1:38:23] <woolieversushawaii> no
[1:38:23] <Kyopheonix> not*
[1:38:25] <+knowyourenemy_97> sad
[1:38:29] <%jinking79> fuck no that shit would be fair
[1:38:30] <+spiegspikel> R Kelly; Age is just a number
[1:38:30] <+shadowmoonsama> Gill has ressurction in the 3 arcade mode
[1:38:31] <Zayasu> poison Kreygasm
[1:38:31] <KaironFortressKnight> get a good ed or alex in there
[1:38:32] <DensityD> woolie talk activate!
[1:38:33] <@Menitta> It'd be fair if Gill had like 1/3 of his life and full everything
[1:38:34] <TheArrow_> costs five bars
[1:38:38] <+Qsmash_> so Dark Phoenix
[1:38:40] <ChrisM341> @lordsdb Well apparently he has a thing for the latter Kappa
[1:38:41] <bigshedman> Didn't they do something like resurrection with Terminator in MK11?
[1:38:42] <+Qsmash_> aka not balanced
[1:38:44] <floralkami> Gil is still shit
[1:38:44] <Nekros4442> Well. Didnt Jason have a ressurection mechanic in MKX that was fair?
[1:38:45] <CuteChallenger> gill has rez in the sf3 arcade path
[1:38:46] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus that would be broke af
[1:38:52] <%CaptainPileDriver> you know it would be
[1:38:52] <Div_the_Penguin> he has ressurection in arcade mode
[1:38:53] <+Superbro64> resurrection is fair ONLY if the other player gets some buff too, in my opinion @WoolieVersus
[1:38:53] <The_Boulder8> Ravens can get to 2.6ft long
[1:38:54] <guymontag0> Remember when Elena had Healing as her second ultra and everyone hated it
[1:39:01] <floralkami> story wise
[1:39:05] <+MasterCosmic> After Resurrection, can no longer gain V Meter and CA.
[1:39:15] <spawnzie> THIS AN'T OVER
[1:39:15] <Graxe_> Well, they gave Gill in the SF3 Arcade Mode boss Resurrection
[1:39:17] <+lshore97> what's the delay on the stream? i haven't even seen the lounge

[1:51:07] <+shadowmoonsama> 3S is still the goat
[1:51:07] <WhiskeyRB> SF4 ost was pretty trash except for a few tracks
[1:51:10] <ChrisM341> I still think Third Strike had the best music
[1:51:13] <@Menitta> 5 has some bangers
[1:51:13] <P0wderedT0astMan> @burkebigsby Vanilla or the other one?
[1:51:15] <WhiskeyRB> underpass was good
[1:51:15] <%CaptainPileDriver> depends
[1:51:17] <+Ryu_R> thats not even a question wtf?
[1:51:18] <%Running_Sets> English voiced El Fuerte was so great
[1:51:20] <Clinnamon> 5 has some great songs
[1:51:21] <Heefnoff> I need to get some Alex going kbradPOINT
[1:51:21] <%CaptainPileDriver> 4 and 5 have some good and bad music
[1:51:22] <%Irridium> V has a lot of problems but the ost isn't it
[1:51:23] <Zayasu> 4 easily
[1:51:23] <+BurkeBigsby> Papa Neir
[1:51:23] <%yeknomlive> 5 has some great songs
[1:51:23] <KaironFortressKnight> I vote 5
[1:51:24] <Arek_1> V, but IV had some nice ones.
[1:51:25] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's equal imo
[1:51:28] <@Menitta> I say 5
[1:51:30] <KgKid51> probably 5
[1:51:31] <JINcredible1> 5 has everything and its better
[1:51:34] <Idon__> They butchered Juri's themes but overall, V OST is godlike.
[1:51:35] <%Running_Sets> V has a lot more elevator music than 4
[1:51:39] <fuji_92> ibuki PogChamp
[1:51:41] <%gatorafan> V > IV
[1:51:42] <%jinking79> Juri SFV song is the Worst
[1:51:42] <+Ryu_R> SF4 has Indestructable and Turn the Beat Back
[1:51:44] <@Menitta> 5 has DMC music so it clearly wins Kappa
[1:51:46] <Squidmops> African Airfield is the best IV stage song next to Volcanic Rim
[1:51:51] <KgKid51> have you heard the arcade themes hggBanger
[1:51:51] <ChrisM341> G has the best theme in V
[1:51:54] <%yeknomlive> 5 has rashidooooooo
[1:51:59] <+razielhex> y'all see that 3rd Strike Ibuki just completely trash that Urien last week?
[1:52:01] <giogio346> sf4 had sakuras theme
[1:52:02] <@Squdnate> 2, nothing beats og guile theme
[1:52:04] <+shadowmoonsama> Zeku theme
[1:52:09] <dmysta3000> Zeku's theme is fuking great
[1:52:18] <microwheel> is that tracksuit lacoste
[1:52:26] <Smileyhat> Second time I've almost got a match but got denied. Why you gotta do me like this?
[1:52:27] <@Menitta> Man I was so disappointed in Ibuki in 5
[1:52:28] <Arek_1> I'll never forgive Capcom for changing Akuma and Gouken's theme in SSFIV onwards to remixes of Ryu's theme...
[1:52:28] <+BurkeBigsby> Gormless Ibuki
[1:52:37] <%sleepy_coffee> sleepy_coffee gifted a Tier 1 sub to AngriestPat! This is their first Gift Sub in the channel!
[1:52:38] <%sleepy_coffee> sleepy_coffee's Gift shared rewards to 5 others in Chat!
[1:52:41] <ryuguitarfreak> Indistructible is unbelievably impossible hard garbage
[1:52:42] <%CaptainPileDriver> 5 also has karin's theme, which, whatever for the character, her theme is good
[1:52:43] <+TopTieramisu> the ibuki jumpsuit works well

[2:28:25] <Jaku2011> Then play Samsho I'd rather watch that now
[2:28:28] <%CaptainPileDriver> v-skill 2 got me back in
[2:28:30] <Arek_1> @Dao_Puppy Yes, Zangief's Double Lariat has projectile invincibility on frames 1-41.
[2:28:31] <+Superbro64> to be fair, someone shouldn't let your opinion of the game effect their joy. What you like purely based on the internet personalities you watch is wack
[2:28:32] <TaylorTot> i mean this game to me is a massive downgrade from 4 so i cant blame you woolie
[2:28:32] <Graxe_> Time for animals?

[2:29:25] <+TopTieramisu> WOOLOMARU
[2:29:28] <Ultimatefool> Honestly yall SF6 needs to be some hype shit to get me back in
[2:29:32] <%Itselguapo> Tell Max to play this shit because he's a coward and won' t play it!
[2:29:47] <Arek_1> @Dao_Puppy Most likely.
[2:29:49] <Guntanks_in_Space> @Superbro64 true lol. then again, i'm the jackass who willingly plays actual kusoge as much as my friend keeps on egging me on how dead my games are
[2:29:56] <DensityD> who's more cute? Kirby or the pokemon Falinks?
[2:30:00] <neet98> SF6 femSeth in starting roster
[2:30:06] <Guntanks_in_Space> it's discouraging, but yeah don't let shit like that discourage anyone from playing whichever FG you want
[2:30:10] <Zayasu> try that on my walking cat
[2:30:11] <SomersaultJustice> what about a falinks made of kirbys?
[2:30:15] <+ggbhtg> @itselguapo uuuuh do you KNOW how many times he played Fight of Gods?
[2:30:20] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> SF6 will have battle royale
[2:30:27] <+Superbro64> @Guntanks_in_Space I'm with Max. Play what you want, because you want to play it.
[2:30:29] <%Itselguapo> @DensityD Kirby after inhaling a falinks for it's power
[2:30:30] <+Superbro64> End of story
[2:30:30] <+TopTieramisu> SF6 in the RE engine atpRtsd
[2:30:35] <Mr_216> atpRtsd3 atpRtsd4
[2:30:37] <DensityD> mouse wheel up: melee. I'm getting physically ill over here
[2:30:39] <DensityD> DansGame
[2:30:40] <+dramajoe> no. we must bully everyone who likes sfv. turn them into jump force mains
[2:30:46] <SomersaultJustice> doodShine
[2:30:53] <fuji_92> leaked sf6 will be called sf for girls and no male character will be in it Kappa
[2:30:55] <%CaptainPileDriver> sf6 legit better have hakan
[2:30:58] <DensityD> good pick @Itselguapo
[2:31:07] <%CaptainPileDriver> either that or a new grappler that's fun
[2:31:11] <neet98> RE engine is prob not good for fighting game
[2:31:21] <Guntanks_in_Space> no wait
[2:31:23] <+TopTieramisu> but kof for girls is bait for girls
[2:31:23] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> SF6 will be shotos only
[2:31:25] <+Superbro64> enough about sfv, WHOS EXCITED for GOKU in season 3 of dbfz though?
[2:31:28] <SuckPuppet> what if SF6 isn't a fighting game
[2:31:29] <+TopTieramisu> if anything, sf6 for girls will be all dudes
[2:31:34] <+ggbhtg> @neet98 why?
[2:31:35] <Guntanks_in_Space> they were able to retool the RE engine to work in DMC5, it's possible they can work an FG in that
[2:31:37] <uncledoodsauce> I thought ja rule and billy were going to show up today?
[2:31:37] <%Itselguapo> oops all shoto shotas
[2:31:39] <%drefizz> SF Heroines
[2:31:47] <Guntanks_in_Space> but it will be expensive to make with its reliance on scanning models
[2:31:50] <%drefizz> thats a good lucio cosplay
[2:31:56] <fuji_92> sf6 will only have sf1 ryu and ken with the same move set Kappa
[2:31:57] <%Puhff> Street Fighter 6: Everyone is Gay
[2:31:59] <+dramajoe> sfvi is a battle royale
[2:32:00] <chronoxgp> sf6 will just be a cable that hooks into the back of your neck and you play in VR
[2:32:05] <neet98> @ggbhtg it's realistic so no color
[2:32:17] <DensityD> did the art commission to Ed Mcmillan for Woolie portrait in Legend of Bumbo style go through yet?
[2:32:22] <+ggbhtg> @neet98 DMC 5?
[2:32:24] <Guntanks_in_Space> okay SF6 is just Striking Vipers
[2:32:26] <pillowwasp> Street fighter 6 is an anime arena fighter
[2:32:38] <+Superbro64> look at the bright side, sfv fans, we'll get anime sfv coming next year, with grandblue Kappa
[2:32:43] <fuji_92> next sf game will be a tactical rpg Kappa

[2:32:45] <+TopTieramisu> sf6 will be a BR that plays like survival mode with human opponents
[2:32:49] <neet98> @ggbhtg they have to dim Dante and Vergil jackets
[2:33:08] <+Superbro64> harada is looking into seeing if X Zone 3 will be a thing
[2:33:10] <%hkarim94> damn this Gerudo Valley goes
[2:33:28] <+TopTieramisu> where's the collage of awful DBZ shirts?
[2:33:29] <SomersaultJustice> I'd be into a raid boss battle where everyone teams up to fight one super powered guy
[2:33:33] <+ggbhtg> X Zone 3, OH. JOY.
[2:33:40] <DensityD> so like salt mines from Thems fighting herds?
[2:33:41] <+dramajoe> why cant harada get john madden as the next dlc character
[2:33:43] <DensityD> ?

[2:36:29] <Guntanks_in_Space> i don't think KOF's going back to sprites the way XII and XIII did after it nearly bankrupted them lol
[2:36:30] <%Ecchigun> salut les gars, merry xmas
[2:36:31] <+Superbro64> I agree
[2:36:31] <NarcissistCactus> fight of animals hggWoke
[2:36:35] <+shadowmoonsama> SF6 will be an RPG
[2:36:42] <Guntanks_in_Space> but never mind that shit, we FIGHTING ANIMALS SOON
[2:36:45] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus does that mean reggie evolved from foot fetish to fisting fetish?
[2:36:58] <Jaku2011> 1 frame links are dumb
[2:37:00] <neet98> but KOF 13 look amazing
[2:37:03] <+Superbro64> I was more on the lines of creativity, other than execution, but sure @WoolieVersus
[2:37:04] <fuji_92> SF6 will a dating sim
[2:37:04] <%CaptainPileDriver> 1 frame links sucks
[2:37:11] <+emperordread> Yes @CaptainPileDriver he's basically a pupetteer now
[2:37:11] <fuji_92> *will be
[2:37:16] <DensityD> aNiMaLs As LeAdErS
[2:37:20] <zepelinnn1> microdashes are the bane of my existance
[2:37:28] <%CaptainPileDriver> so reggie loves fisting
[2:37:30] <%Wool> Reggie's favorite food is french fries because it has potatoes and tomatoes
[2:37:32] <%CaptainPileDriver> remember this lore
[2:37:37] <+ggbhtg> But Electrics MATTER SO MUCH IN TEKKEN right? Kappa
[2:37:47] <DensityD> a floor bounce or a wall bounce?
[2:37:51] <+emperordread> anything at the end of a limb basically. Fist, feet, it's all good
[2:37:53] <SomersaultJustice> SF6 is F2P
[2:38:02] <Solidnick18> as long as they take their time on it
[2:38:09] <%Irridium> SF6 honestly should be F2P
[2:38:13] <fuji_92> sf6 will be a anime fighter, with air dashes and shit
[2:38:16] <chronoxgp> sf6 is all claymation
[2:38:19] <neet98> Titty SETH in starting roster

[2:38:36] <+Superbro64> LONG ASS MINUTE
[2:38:37] <+RenoDeGeneric> I feel like Capcom only cares about pleasing its old, super unaware board members
[2:38:40] <%generalve> face it woolie. Yoshi is holding Capcom fight team back he has to go
[2:38:43] <artificiallynatural> SF6 will be a MOBA
[2:38:44] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's been a hot fucking minute
[2:38:48] <+ggbhtg> beena minnit
[2:38:49] <+Mcmoblin> Weird to think Capcom is falling off in the fighting category.... :\
[2:38:58] <+Superbro64> minute and a half man
[2:38:59] <fuji_92> sf6 will be a mmo
[2:39:00] <Xenokhrist> when's capcom cart

[3:05:53] <+Superbro64> JUNEN HAYAIN DA YO
[3:05:53] <KalmVibrations> Cat went down after the patch
[3:05:55] <YoOctober> day 1 tier list
[3:05:56] <+sunny_side_up> when u walkin
[3:05:57] <+RelaxedPizza> Any cat that can walk is top tier in my heart
[3:05:59] <%mzrx7> wack
[3:06:02] <+heroicspiritavenger> Is the Soul Calibur Hori Stick any good? I saw one at a discount retailer, and had considered picking one up.
[3:06:04] <fuji_92> first week tier lists woolz

[3:06:27] <bevyrage> @DensityD he already knows
[3:06:31] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> Octo was really digging Fox
[3:06:33] <+Pookiedaexzile> Tierzoo should get his branding on this
[3:06:36] <StarlitStunner> rooPog
[3:06:38] <+ggbhtg> Tierzoo was the battle designer Kappa
[3:06:47] <+Pookiedaexzile> That's a good cross promotion
[3:06:47] <%yeknomlive> that seth kick
[3:06:49] <SpaceCatStation> PogChamp
[3:06:57] <%Wool> Fox is actually bottom tier. Everything is unsafe
[3:06:58] <%mzrx7> @KalmVibrations when did the game get updated btw? probably got auto-updated and i cleared queue.

[3:07:19] <%ATRodger> 3, 4, or 6 button game?
[3:07:21] <+RelaxedPizza> @ggbhtg All frogs are now D tier
[3:07:22] <ivelischpfuli> seeing Might Fox's animations reminds me of Darkseid's, where he always kept his hands behind his back
[3:07:34] <%mzrx7> cool thanks
[3:07:42] <+ggbhtg> scissor kick NIGHTMAREEEEE
[3:07:45] <DensityD> I wish it said Biff and Baff and Wack and Don as well as Pow!
[3:07:50] <DensityD> but for now it's all just POW!
[3:08:01] <+Pookiedaexzile> Double it up
[3:08:12] <faqmachine> what's the closest analogue to this game gameplay-wise?
[3:08:12] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:08:12] <ivelischpfuli> it's a really minor nitpick, but it's sort of the same trap of "hands don't move, so motions look more strained and awkward"
[3:08:18] <DensityD> what the fox say?
[3:08:20] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> New Evo Main Stage game?
[3:08:20] <DensityD> say my name
[3:08:23] <%mzrx7> @faqmachine fight of gods Kappa
[3:08:41] <KalmVibrations> The fox and the squirrel are the two top tiers now iirc, now that Fox's legs have a better hitbox and squirrel's loop and projectile game got improved
[3:08:45] <YoOctober> @ATRodger 3 attack, one skill button
[3:08:56] <%ATRodger> cool
[3:09:05] <DensityD> is this mexican health values or canadian damage values?
[3:09:05] <deafmelone> I think fox is like that cuz its funny
[3:09:07] <+Pookiedaexzile> Fox use you're range
[3:09:16] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> HOOOO!?! You approach me!? FOX!?!
[3:09:34] <%SUTTONSOMEGA> i cant beat the shit out of you without getting closer
[3:09:48] <ivelischpfuli> like i said it's a minor nitpick among a clearly fun and cheeky game

[3:15:26] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> How is fox bottom tier when hes top tier
[3:15:26] <+Superbro64> these canadian resets
[3:15:44] <%Wool> Fox is bottom tier because literally everything is unsafe except for his lights
[3:15:46] <cartoonmuppet> Double Toasted brought me here! They were hosting this stream.
[3:15:46] <%CaptainPileDriver> yeah, if there was a grappler i'd be super in
[3:15:49] <fluke_LKZ> There's no throws because the devs explained it would cost too much to put the animations in, at the time
[3:15:51] <@Squdnate> @CaptainPileDriver It's so much better than it has any right to be. And it has good rollback GGPO (Not KI tier, but still good)
[3:15:57] <+Pookiedaexzile> I have a grappler concept: Anacoda with nothing but command grabs
[3:16:01] <DensityD> Woolie, THAT'S the weirdest thing about the game?
[3:16:10] <%yeknomlive> yeah that beginning is straight up wake me up before you go go
[3:16:10] <6ixsideseoulo> so no one feels weird bout this jitterbug xmas remix

[3:29:28] <DensityD> but dat meter doe
[3:29:30] <%CaptainPileDriver> this is better than sfv in terms of how fun it is to watch
[3:29:31] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:29:32] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Guntanks_in_Space
[3:29:33] <DensityD> will he ever use it?
[3:29:39] <+Pookiedaexzile> Nobody say anything, but Woolie is having more fun with this than SF5
[3:29:44] <Guntanks_in_Space> oops, caps. where's the Aegis Reflector Deers
[3:29:56] <+Joe2187> so they already did SFV?
[3:30:00] <Rada150> deer is a counter god
[3:30:07] <DensityD> that's right, they did SFV
[3:30:07] <%croxeye> this game is really entertaining to watch, and probably pretty simple enough for newcomers like myself to pickup and play very fast
[3:30:10] <+Pookiedaexzile> Yeah a little while ago
[3:30:14] <fuji_92> Reggie will NEVER use that meter
[3:30:25] <Guntanks_in_Space> this should indeed be simple enough to pick up and play
[3:30:28] <Guntanks_in_Space> fight of gods was this
[3:30:33] <Guntanks_in_Space> this should be even simpler
[3:31:08] <DensityD> reggie mind goblins

[3:46:37] <Charles445> I think the cat is that one edit of the white cat who's standing up and has stubby arms looks like he's gonna beat somebody up
[3:46:37] <Guntanks_in_Space> i only don't know gorilla crow and fox
[3:46:41] <+jK00215> wheres dat boi?

[3:46:59] <+ggbhtg> BOB BARKERED
[3:47:14] <%Wool> bruh this guy playing from Denmark
[3:47:20] <DensityD> more fighting games, less bork breakers
[3:47:38] <%yeknomlive> hado
[3:47:45] <Guntanks_in_Space> @WoolieVersus so how does the netplay feel mang
[3:47:55] <DensityD> I'm a casual scrub, and I think Hadoken is more iconic
[3:48:05] <%CasualDrunk> CasualDrunk subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 1 month streak!
[3:48:09] <KSDM> ono doesn't ask people to haduoken though
[3:48:16] <%Odin_777> came for Street Fighter stayed for FIGHT OF ANIMALS
[3:48:23] <Guntanks_in_Space> GOOD
[3:48:26] <DensityD> Hype of Animals for Twitch Prime sub
[3:48:27] <Guntanks_in_Space> that is what i wanted to know
[3:48:29] <DensityD> sub hype
[3:48:31] <Civet10> before i even knew who ryu was, i knew what hadouken was
[3:48:40] <+ggbhtg> FEEEELS GOOD....SOUNDS GOOOOD
[3:48:48] <+Pookiedaexzile> REggie going Nuts on the track
[3:48:52] <robin2098> woolieOMG
[3:48:54] <%Wool> @WoolieVersus 2H>4S>6S>Dash cancel
[3:48:59] <Prevot> fighting game devs are definitely not watching
[3:48:59] <DensityD> NUT
[3:49:02] <%Wool> sorry, 5>4S>6S>Dash
[3:49:06] <%Wool> 5H* omfg
[3:49:27] <beatie_g> nah it's be worse
[3:49:29] <oceanmatt> def worse
[3:49:30] <artificiallynatural> worse
[3:49:33] <Guntanks_in_Space> worse
[3:49:34] <+Deko_> they are based on meme animals so its worse
[3:49:34] <%mzrx7> worse free
[3:49:34] <DensityD> worse, as a fighting game
[3:49:34] <artcellrox> worse
[3:49:34] <fuji_92> worst
[3:49:36] <%croxeye> worse, cuz memes tho
[3:49:36] <+Jintais3rd> WORSE
[3:49:37] <StormKingLD> worse
[3:49:39] <%Wool> there is probably a fighting game with actual animals
[3:49:39] <+Pookiedaexzile> Yo, who makes this, this is one Texture overlay from being onstage
[3:49:39] <fuji_92> worse
[3:49:40] <DensityD> better, as a joke game
[3:49:42] <+ggbhtg> Super unbalanced @woolieversus
[3:49:42] <+Superbro64> sounds beyond the scope of a 5 buck game
[3:49:42] <%Irridium> worse which would make it better
[3:49:45] <xaekin> it's possible to burst out of your opponent's burst in this game. It's ridiculous and I love it
[3:49:46] <+Pookiedaexzile> at EVO
[3:49:50] <@Menitta> What was that video with Keits that talked about GGPO?
[3:49:54] <+Superbro64> this is also a joke game based on meme images
[3:49:58] <cheesedburgers> This would be worse without the memes
[3:50:03] <DensityD> Woolie, what you are describing is Tokyo Zoo
[3:50:04] <implied_consent> Woolz
[3:50:04] <mihokspawn> The cat and fox would be a horror show then
[3:50:06] <artificiallynatural> the hold back to block documentary about KI
[3:50:11] <%croxeye> it's a thailand studio IIRC
[3:50:15] <@Menitta> @artificiallynatural Thanks
[3:50:17] <+Superbro64> @menitta on hold back to block's yt channel
[3:50:19] <+dmtjinni> This game funnnnny
[3:50:24] <Guntanks_in_Space> i thought design crafters were taiwanese lol @croxeye
[3:50:30] <%Wool> Fireball can meaty for oki
[3:50:30] <+ggbhtg> reggie denies the masses of Super
[3:50:32] <%croxeye> ah my bad
[3:50:35] <+ggbhtg> as usual

[3:50:48] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule

[3:51:38] <Mendin> Give em the microchip
[3:51:45] <DrStinkers> R\eggie was a squirrel in a past life
[3:51:48] <+TheBesteban> Not at the moment @Guntanks_in_Space, but possibly in the future!
[3:51:50] <%croxeye> yeah def Taiwanese devs i got the wrong info
[3:52:02] <DensityD> dropped
[3:52:08] <+Pookiedaexzile> @GeltonZ Thank you, I been needingtobrush up on my Cantonese
[3:52:09] <ImportunoDiz> >The animals aren't fighting on 4 legs
[3:52:10] <Guntanks_in_Space> @TheBesteban man that spooky feature was 21/10 easily lol
[3:52:16] <ImportunoDiz> This isn't a proper animal fighter
[3:52:22] <Charles445> give em the fancy feast
[3:52:25] <DensityD> this is Fight of Animals
[3:52:25] <ImportunoDiz> Even Kuma and Panda crouch
[3:52:28] <+TheBesteban> Thanks! It was a ton of fun to make
[3:52:29] <extradopeness> Wtf am I looking at?
[3:52:42] <@Menitta> the future
[3:52:48] <+Pookiedaexzile> The Best 2d Fighter out right now
[3:52:50] <Guntanks_in_Space> also oh yeah the lack of DAT BOI in a Meme Animal fighter is a bit of a glaring omission huh
[3:52:50] <+ggbhtg> what ARENT you looking at?
[3:52:51] <fuji_92> the fgc
[3:52:53] <DensityD> you are looking at Power Hook Dog and Walking Cat fight in Christmas costumes
[3:52:53] <extradopeness> I like this future
[3:52:55] <neet98> sf5
[3:53:05] <razorgem> this needs to be at EVO
[3:53:07] <beatie_g> This is the neutral heavy game the fgc has been asking for
[3:53:15] <ImportunoDiz> pfffft
[3:53:16] <themightyseptopus> this music tho SourPls
[3:53:22] <neet98> actually sf6
[3:53:24] <fuji_92> SourPls
[3:53:25] <Charles445> dat boi dlc, did they do any dlc for fight of gods?
[3:53:28] <DensityD> PogChamp
[3:53:34] <ImportunoDiz> These juggles
[3:53:41] <+Superbro64> a 5 dollar game with better netcode then a vast majority of your fully priced, $60 dollar fighting game titles
[3:53:43] <Guntanks_in_Space> @Charles445 yes, the most recent addition to the roster is Susano-o lol
[3:53:43] <extradopeness> Yoooo
[3:53:45] <%ATRodger> cat is my main. Now Igotta get this game
[3:53:46] <+ggbhtg> Cat is FED

[3:53:53] <%Taglog7> Elmo Privilege
[3:53:53] <fuji_92> CAT IS FED
[3:53:55] <DensityD> Fancy Feast or Whiskahs
[3:53:58] <+ggbhtg> Cat is WELL, FED
[3:54:01] <+Superbro64> reminder that smash won fighting game of the year and still has garbage online
[3:54:05] <+Pookiedaexzile> This is a.....AROSTOCAT
[3:54:07] <Guntanks_in_Space> also speaking of fight of gods updates, that game too has rollback netcode too
[3:54:08] <@Squdnate> i feed my son he is becoming powerful
[3:54:08] <+Superbro64> fix your online kids
[3:54:21] <DensityD> everybody, everybody, everybody wants to be a cat
[3:54:21] <Mendin> This cat had his loops
[3:54:22] <Guntanks_in_Space> i think adding rollback there was practice for getting rollback in this game lol
[3:54:26] <Man_in_the_Red> @superbro64 its still a meme game that we will forget until Kusoge night
[3:54:30] <DensityD> Loops Haägen-Dazs
[3:54:39] <ImportunoDiz> DROPPED THE COMBOV
[3:54:40] <+Superbro64> @fatally_furious still has better online Kappa
[3:54:42] <neet98> Nintendo: "netcode, wat is dat?"
[3:54:46] <ImportunoDiz> DON'T DROP THOSE COMBOS
[3:54:47] <+ggbhtg> Cat is FED? NAW CAT IS DED
[3:54:49] <GeltonZ> @Charles445 OOH! Good pick!
[3:54:55] <DrStinkers> what's the paw cleaning mechanic
[3:54:57] <%Wool> Overhead>Heavy
[3:54:58] <cumurasame> i-is this game legit?
[3:55:03] <Charles445> Wasn't my pick someone was suggesting it, but I gotta agree with dat boi being good
[3:55:03] <Man_in_the_Red> @superbro64 perfect game for MaximillianDood Kappa
[3:55:08] <+MechaBaphomet> Hows the netcode?
[3:55:10] <DensityD> sonicfox, we summon thee
[3:55:10] <neet98> EVO READY
[3:55:17] <+TheBesteban> Damn, I want to play more haha
[3:55:23] <+Superbro64> @fatally_furious max stans fight crab tho Kappa
[3:55:24] <%croxeye> @MechaBaphomet it's rollback and looking great
[3:55:26] <Mendin> Fight of Gods and Fight of Dogs
[3:55:27] <Charles445> the future of unicycle tech
[3:55:30] <Guntanks_in_Space> IT HAS ROLLBACK NOW
[3:55:31] <%Wool> we can probably hop back on since it doesn't seem like that many people are playing @TheBesteban
[3:55:37] <+ggbhtg> @woolieversus BOTH DO
[3:55:43] <+ez_eight> is 2p m. bison
[3:55:46] <Guntanks_in_Space> @WoolieVersus both this and Fight of Gods have rollback now
[3:55:48] <+ggbhtg> @woolieversus BOTH got it
[3:55:52] <Guntanks_in_Space> like holy shit HOW
[3:55:53] <xaekin> can we make the penguin playable
[3:55:57] <Guntanks_in_Space> how come THEY GET IT
[3:56:07] <DensityD> PJSalt
[3:56:11] <DensityD> PJSugar
[3:56:20] <fuji_92> ggpo is free to use, right?
[3:56:23] <%croxeye> yes
[3:56:24] <+ez_eight> wtf this game looks legit
[3:56:27] <+ggbhtg> cuz GGPO is free now and they aren't a japan studio
[3:56:28] <%Wool> BRUH WHAT IS THIS SPECTATOR SYSTEM
[3:56:28] <cumurasame> how is this game so legit
[3:56:29] <%croxeye> MIT free license now
[3:56:44] <Charles445> now they gotta sell a service "we will put ggpo in your game look we did it with ours"
[3:56:49] <Mendin> Give me an opossum and I'm sold
[3:56:49] <+Superbro64> ggpo is free to use, but not easy to implement
[3:56:54] <Guntanks_in_Space> ^
[3:57:03] <+ggbhtg> PINGU GUEST FIGHTER les go @woolieversus
[3:57:03] <mihokspawn> Penguin is subzero
[3:57:07] <+Superbro64> but to be fair, ANY online infrastructure is
[3:57:08] <Guntanks_in_Space> basically it's "the game has to be designed with this netcode in mind"
[3:57:12] <+Superbro64> keep that in mind
[3:57:15] <fuji_92> is it not easy to implement tho?
[3:57:18] <Guntanks_in_Space> and it's not as easy to implement as it sounds
[3:57:22] <DensityD> you can't have "just a penguin" DLC. the theme is a funny forced perspective animal meme picture
[3:57:24] <Mendin> Penguin is Hakan without having to oil up
[3:57:24] <fuji_92> I mean, look
[3:57:25] <xaekin> to paraphrase KI's dev, netcode is hard no matter what
[3:57:25] <Guntanks_in_Space> especially when you put game engines and shit in mind
[3:57:31] <artcellrox> i thought the GGPO dudes said they'd help implemented it for low cost though?
[3:57:36] <DensityD> like that one where it appears the Donkey is 2 headed
[3:57:42] <Mendin> Fire Goose
[3:57:50] <+ggbhtg> @thebesteban tell em the truth

[3:57:50] <cumurasame> @DensityD Make it Grape-kun
[3:57:52] <+Superbro64> reminder that ALL NETCODE is hard, so you might as well go for the good stuff
[3:58:00] <+Superbro64> video games arent cake to make kids
[3:58:03] <DensityD> I....I do love Grape-Kun
[3:58:08] <ImportunoDiz> USE THAT METER!
[3:58:11] <+ggbhtg> RIP Grape

[3:58:31] <nobknee> W O W
[3:58:33] <+glassesaregod> @artcellrox They did, but not many were taking up their offer, so they said "Fuck it, ggpo available for everyone, excuses on life support."

[3:58:54] <+TheBesteban> Damn, I can't link the video in here, but I did a whole video on netcode. Look up Hold Back To Block on Youtube
[3:59:00] <Guntanks_in_Space> also to mind, getting it implemented right should be done right otherwise you get SFV lol
[3:59:02] <Charles445> grape joins the roster but he's holding a dakimakura of the kfriends idol
[3:59:08] <Guntanks_in_Space> where the netcode is poorly done even if it is rollback
[3:59:12] <Charles445> that's his weapon
[3:59:22] <+Superbro64> reminder that keits interview is now subbed in Japanese
[3:59:24] <%QaizerArt> BDIBIT might be someone who ain't watching stream @WoolieVersus
[3:59:25] <+ggbhtg> not watching stream LUL
[3:59:27] <%croxeye> is bdbit watching the stream? or just a random maybe?
[3:59:27] <+dmtjinni> BIDIBIT AFK
[3:59:39] <GamerWorlock> this not a locked room?
[3:59:41] <%Wool> I don't think he's a viewer lmao
[3:59:43] <fuji_92> yeah, he prob not watching
[3:59:47] <KalmVibrations> -_-
[3:59:53] <GamerWorlock> if not hes a random
[3:59:55] <ChinMusicTwo> beat his ass
[3:59:57] <%Irridium> yo so how come that netcode felt better than the vast majority of other fighting games'?
[3:59:59] <+ggbhtg> usually you SHOULDNT watch and stream anyway
[4:00:04] <PFlare> Oh my god, Woolie playing Fight of Animals, hell yeah.
[4:00:08] <+FoolsArcade> wow
[4:00:14] <%croxeye> cuz it's not made by a japanese dev Irridium lol
[4:00:14] <+ggbhtg> @irridium GGPO
[4:00:15] <DensityD> hey @WoolieVersus when was the most recent time you suffered from "one guy" in chat?
[4:00:21] <Guntanks_in_Space> but @WoolieVersus IT HAS NETCODE NOW
[4:00:22] <+Superbro64> we have fight of animals REGULARS in here? PogChamp
[4:00:23] <DensityD> real glow-up
[4:00:26] <%Irridium> huh this GGPO is pretty neat more people should use it
[4:00:29] <artcellrox> @Guntanks_in_Space doesn't SF5 use its own form of rollback netcode though? and not GGPO?
[4:00:33] <Guntanks_in_Space> Fight of Gods has rollback of all things
[4:00:38] <+ggbhtg> @woolieversus FOG has GGPO now
[4:00:41] <Guntanks_in_Space> @artcellrox yea the Kagemusha thing iirc it's called
[4:00:43] <%croxeye> yeah they did see that message
[4:00:49] <+Superbro64> @irridium its only existed since 2007 Kappa
[4:01:01] <Guntanks_in_Space> though iirc i heard MVCI has good rollback on it
[4:01:06] <fuji_92> Suggested: Blocking
[4:01:15] <%Irridium> @Superbro64 NotLikeThis
[4:01:19] <%Wool> Fox is especially unsafe, which is why he's low tier
[4:01:28] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Suggested: Suggested: Suggested:
[4:01:32] <+ggbhtg> MCVI does have good rollback netcode unlike SFV
[4:01:34] <@Squdnate> Just to verify how good GGPO is. I'm from Denmark, and I experienced absolutely no lag at all against Reggie
[4:01:40] <mrparanoia07> MVCI and Power Rangers has good netcode. SFV has it bad.
[4:01:57] <+ggbhtg> good rollback u mean
[4:02:01] <ImportunoDiz> >Wool
[4:02:08] <mrparanoia07> @ggbhtg yes thank you

[4:02:14] <ImportunoDiz> Someone is gonna get sued, taking wool's bit
[4:02:19] <DigitalKen> I believe Digital Crafter was using their own roll back instead of GGPO
[4:02:20] <Guntanks_in_Space> @Squdnate right? I'm from south east asia and i played a dude from florida and it nearly felt like offline lol
[4:02:22] <+Superbro64> reminder that YEARS ago, Mori and Daisuke of Arc Sys, when asked about rollback, both said "We know about it. Please stop asking"
[4:02:25] <%king_wragles> @WoolieVersus remake the room with a password
[4:02:27] <+Superbro64> doodBait
[4:02:28] <%Wool> you can't kick them lmao?
[4:02:29] <KalmVibrations> nope
[4:02:33] <Charles445> passworded room is a good idea
[4:02:38] <+Superbro64> at least they are considering it now
[4:02:45] <fuji_92> just do a password room

[4:05:47] <Man_in_the_Red> my prediction is Rollback in some form will be made like a Kagemusha to be used in multiple Arc Sys projects, maybe as soon as Guilty Gear Strive: Second Album or something
