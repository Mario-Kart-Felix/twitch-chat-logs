[0:22:44] <%CaptainPileDriver> yeah, this game is on ps3 and vita but not ps4 for the west
[0:22:45] <tigerfang86> I wish I could climax with woolie
[0:22:50] <poutinedreamteam> I have the English PSV version
[0:22:51] <ManOfReason> wait it came out on ps3 in 2015?!?!
[0:22:54] <Pnutz409> Is this headlining at Evo?
[0:23:03] <One_More_Beer_> maybe in the bathroom
[0:23:10] <Man_in_the_Red> @manofreason Just Dance is still releaskng on the Wii
[0:23:16] <FalcoLambda> the original version is in the west, ignition is a sequel update
[0:23:23] <gustavozxd> @pnutz409 oh yeah it's gonna take sfv's place
[0:23:32] <NinjaTB> yea this game came out like 2 months before guilty gear xrd, not sure when ignition came out, but it was well after
[0:23:36] <ManOfReason> thats just crazy
[0:23:41] <+mcjimbles> As someone not up to date on podcasts, has woolie mentioned how many episodes of hxh he watched or is he keeping that secret?
[0:23:59] <FalcoLambda> english version of DFC dropped in october 2015. ignition's release date? december 2015.
[0:24:05] <gustavozxd> I might hate nearly every single character in this game but I'm a sucker for anime fighters regardless
[0:24:19] <jonathandemel> @mcjimbles Secret I think
[0:24:27] <Man_in_the_Red> isnt there a Virtua Fighter in here
[0:24:32] <FalcoLambda> akira and pai
[0:24:42] <+mcjimbles> @jonathandemel ok cool, just wondering
[0:24:42] <gustavozxd> Akira playable, Pai is assist
[0:24:54] <FalcoLambda> trump card
[0:24:59] <FalcoLambda> it's called a trump card
[0:25:16] <NinjaTB> yea it's called a trump
[0:25:21] <prime_name> When's Kirito?
[0:25:45] <%Solidnick18> woolieSHOOK woolieSHOOK
[0:25:51] <NinjaTB> kirito is trash :)
[0:26:06] <gustavozxd> I like this guy, his moves look stupid af
[0:26:13] <Man_in_the_Red> @ninjatb he must be high tier then Kappa
[0:26:15] <Ai_FGC> imagine picking kirito in anything 4Head
[0:26:28] <NinjaTB> lol
[0:26:42] <%CaptainPileDriver> good pick woolie
[0:26:49] <mercado94> 4Head
[0:26:54] <@Menitta> Who is the boxer archetype in this game
[0:26:56] <gustavozxd> that latest sao where you could create your own character was a huge disappointment solely because you couldn't NTR Kirito
[0:27:03] <One_More_Beer_> asuna seems like a gorilla
[0:27:03] <+happyfaceman> is this the game with saya no uta
[0:27:04] <NinjaTB> i can't say anything, i played kirino in dbfc, and tatsuya in dbfci =/
[0:27:13] <mercado94> Hold the fuck on is that Kino?/
[0:27:18] <Man_in_the_Red> @zoibek thats nitroplus(?)
[0:27:21] <+Austinck> how could like SAO after the incest part
[0:27:24] <+Polter_ge1st> They nerfed the crap of Easy bake comboman Kirito in this mode
[0:27:26] <NinjaTB> yup, kino assist
[0:27:36] <Man_in_the_Red> i remember the Fisticuffs thumbnail
[0:27:45] <sileo_patronus> @haveswordmuststing yeah nitroplus blasterz
[0:27:49] <mercado94> Holy shit it is Kino
[0:27:59] <ike_shamus> I play asuna and yuuki
[0:28:06] <gustavozxd> @austinck I don't even want to make the joke "but that means it's even better" but yeah some might say
[0:28:17] <zecht89> @Zoibek yep, that cum dumpster is in this
[0:28:22] <@Menitta> woolieOMG
[0:28:40] <Man_in_the_Red> man, Capcom Vs Capcom could be real easy to make if they go by roster and assist roster like this or Mahvel 1
[0:28:40] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:28:45] <sileo_patronus> But is the game kino?
[0:28:48] <NinjaTB> wait is saaya in this? i thought that was nitro blasters
[0:28:57] <gustavozxd> nah she's not
[0:29:06] <ike_shamus> saaya isnt in the game
[0:29:08] <zecht89> oh right
[0:29:17] <spardanwarrior> Saaya was in the game with the chick from Senran Kagura
[0:29:19] <%Solidnick18> lol
[0:29:21] <zecht89> got them mixed up
[0:29:24] <%Solidnick18> what the
[0:29:25] <gustavozxd> saaya is in the hentai fighter
[0:29:33] <NinjaTB> ^this
[0:29:36] <+Polter_ge1st> Back A B for armored Universal Overhead
[0:29:41] <gustavozxd> like half that game's roster is from a hentai
[0:29:45] <Man_in_the_Red> wont fault you for mixing up the light novel fighters
[0:30:04] <@Menitta> One has Saber, the other has Kirito. Pick your poison
[0:30:17] <FalcoLambda> actually, one's a visual novel fighter and the other's a light novel fighter-- this is the most dweeb thing i've ever said i'm so sorry
[0:30:28] <@Menitta> Its up there.
[0:30:40] <NinjaTB> i thought nitro blasters was fun, til i found out til you could forward dash over cmd grabs. i dropped that game so fast
[0:30:42] <FalcoLambda> the implications of this scare me
[0:30:42] <sileo_patronus> @Menitta Saber every time, fuck that guy
[0:30:51] <sileo_patronus> I don't even care about fate
[0:31:12] <hamahiroyuki> is there a fighter with konosuba characters?
[0:31:12] <Ai_FGC> @menitta i'll take the hentai chick over a paper towel every time
[0:31:13] <gustavozxd> saber reminds of everything fate related
[0:31:28] <fuji_92> the Trump is an overhead, don't forget Kappa
[0:31:59] <cerazor01> any thing like Dust from guilty gear in this?
[0:32:06] <gustavozxd> this dude just throws furniture and shit it's so stupid LUL
[0:32:09] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Where's the RWBY waifus in this crossover whatever game SwiftRage
[0:32:12] <+Polter_ge1st> You also have an armored universal overhead with Back A B
[0:32:24] <sileo_patronus> That was close, reggie isn't pushing buttons hard enough
[0:32:39] <Man_in_the_Red> oh right, Selveria is here too

[0:33:44] <gustavozxd> what's the anime about
[0:33:57] <+freeizone> romcom
[0:33:57] <prime_name> Why is there a Dead or Alive character in this game?
[0:34:00] <FalcoLambda> it's a pretty standard romcom but it sets itself apart with really incredible characters
[0:34:00] <%Solidnick18> yoooo
[0:34:03] <%CJett92> High school romance comedy/drama
[0:34:05] <ManOfReason> LOL summons the fucking pole
[0:34:11] <%CJett92> But it's better than it's genres
[0:34:31] <%NecDW4> Ohh shit, i didnt notice Erio in this
[0:34:33] <+Polter_ge1st> Woolie Akira has rekas
[0:34:39] <FalcoLambda> the characters are its strong point, and its a VERY VERY strong, strong point
[0:34:40] <%Solidnick18> accelerator PogChamp

[0:35:05] <%NeroInfinite> This is one anime ass anime game.
[0:35:09] <%Solidnick18> YEAH
[0:35:15] <jonathandemel> @CJett92 How the hell can something be better than its genres? Genres are neither good nor bad, they're just very general descriptors.
[0:35:21] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Where's the good animes in this anime fighter LUL
[0:35:31] <%FuqBoiSlim> What's virtua fighter????
[0:35:38] <goose_attack_almanac> @PleasantPervert Toradora. That's it.
[0:35:38] <Kdillman> Virtua Fighter has been the best anime in it so far
[0:35:41] <powerprotoman> you mean dead or alive right woolie?
[0:35:41] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:35:42] <%gatorafan> In Virtua Fighter all you did was down light punch, that's why you don't remember Kappa
[0:35:57] <Tucker0603> TAIGA is the cutest tsundere ever
[0:35:59] <Ai_FGC> even sega dont know what virtua fighter is Jebaited
[0:36:05] <%CJett92> @jonathandemel Because they're very generic genres that would make people think it's a super generic show on surface level
[0:36:11] <Man_in_the_Red> @gatorafan i think thats Melty Blood your thinking of Kappa
[0:36:13] <sileo_patronus> Is this strong accelerator or less strong accelerator?
[0:36:22] <alrobot2014> @Midnight_Crest virtua fighter is a yakuza mingame LUL
[0:36:43] <+JakeSG> @CJett92 I think that's just like, your opinion man
[0:36:50] <ike_shamus> this game is all about resource management
[0:36:54] <Man_in_the_Red> heres to hoping Shenmue is a secret Virtua Fighter 6 prototype

[0:46:51] <%Solidnick18> oh
[0:46:54] <%Solidnick18> fuck i'm blind
[0:46:58] <%NecDW4> Boogiepop Phantom was heckin sweet. The recent version that covered the actual LNs was also good
[0:46:58] <%Tearonex> last order!?
[0:47:00] <@Menitta> I remember watching a little bit of that show. it sucked
[0:47:01] <jonathandemel> Should've been Onii-sama instead of her
[0:47:01] <+Austinck> gun lance
[0:47:07] <sileo_patronus> That's just a gunlance don't lie
[0:47:08] <deafmelone> NiGHTS STAGE!
[0:47:19] <CalderGaming> @jonathandemel he's both an assist and a dlc character
[0:47:22] <Zayasu> Kreygasm
[0:47:32] <jonathandemel> @CalderGaming Nice
[0:47:33] <gustavozxd> @haveswordmuststing one thing I know about that game is that I hate Rex and Pyra and that ending is fucking hilarious
[0:47:57] <jonathandemel> Sounds like Mitsuru
[0:47:58] <%Solidnick18> wtf
[0:48:00] <+freeizone> beam=gattling gun aka lightning move
[0:48:00] <%Solidnick18> lol
[0:48:17] <FalcoLambda> pew pew pew pew
[0:48:24] <%Solidnick18> what
[0:48:26] <%Solidnick18> huh
[0:48:29] <gustavozxd> damn she sounds super pissed off
[0:48:31] <Guntanks_in_Space> who's the lovely guest in the stream this time?
[0:48:50] <Guntanks_in_Space> also tfw my main here was basketball loli just because her specials here are incredibly hilarious
[0:48:51] <+Polter_ge1st> reflection guard is pushblock I believe
[0:48:58] <Guntanks_in_Space> also yea that's pushblock
[0:48:59] <mercado94> should I watch the boogiepop anime? I kinda ignore it when I found out MotherBasement was praising it
[0:49:11] <ike_shamus> that assist is air unblockable
[0:49:17] <FalcoLambda> it's a marvel-style pushblock
[0:49:24] <%NecDW4> @mercado94 do you mean the recent one, or the OLD 90s one
[0:49:28] <gustavozxd> @guntanks_in_space what about the blonde furniture man LUL also I do like the idea of a basketball moveset
[0:49:35] <+Polter_ge1st> @falcolambda yeah yeah
[0:49:48] <@Menitta> God that's like Rotom in Pokken
[0:49:48] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:49:49] <hassanico1> Somehow I got this game confused with Nitroplus Fighters
[0:49:49] <+Arnschen> Boogiepop is pretty interesting. I've only seen a few episodes of the recent one though, I need to get back to it.
[0:49:56] <CalderGaming> @mercado94 if you have the time, why not. better to ignore MB altogether than make decisions with/against his opinions
[0:50:06] <+Arnschen> ^
[0:50:09] <Guntanks_in_Space> @gustavozxd i wanted to also try furniture man lol but Basketball Loli was infinitely hilarious turning the opponent into basketballs and shooting big 3's in her level 3 super lol
[0:50:26] <mercado94> alright I'm going to watch both the new and old version
[0:50:31] <%Solidnick18> who
[0:50:32] <%NecDW4> LAST ORDER!
[0:50:32] <Guntanks_in_Space> alternatively i think i played Taiga or Biribiri
[0:50:41] <sileo_patronus> Wait was that last order?
[0:50:43] <FalcoLambda> the last order counter was nerfed so hard in this game
[0:50:48] <gustavozxd> Zatch Bell
[0:50:50] <sileo_patronus> neat
[0:50:50] <CalderGaming> that was she, yes
[0:51:07] <sileo_patronus> I guess you wouldn't just have accelerator
[0:51:08] <%FuqBoiSlim> read
[0:51:22] <FalcoLambda> in vanilla she could activate as she was coming out but i this game if you hit her as shes coming out it's deactivated
[0:51:27] <+Austinck> I use to watch zatch bell when it was on YTV
[0:51:32] <Sol_Install> it's a full screen and overhead?
[0:51:37] <FalcoLambda> yeah
[0:51:44] <BackwardCap> Spell Casting with my Smart Phone in another world Kappa
[0:51:45] <Sol_Install> god damn
[0:51:55] <OldManDeckardCain> now that's some nine BS LUL
[0:52:15] <sileo_patronus> God I tried to watch that smart phone shit and it failed me immediately
[0:52:18] <hassanico1> Oh, so Woolie enioys the Boss character :D
[0:52:22] <%NecDW4> OHHHH Kuroyukihime time!
[0:52:38] <Guntanks_in_Space> over the other anime LN fighters that came out like this and uhhh, nitro+ blasterz i love this more than the others
[0:52:42] <fuji_92> Kuroyukihime Kreygasm
[0:52:51] <%FuqBoiSlim> yall still watch isekaishit 🤢
[0:52:53] <hassanico1> Nitro+ is fun too
[0:53:04] <zamzoph> @WoolieVersus Accel World is the other thing by SAO guy I think
[0:53:08] <alrobot2014> yep
[0:53:14] <Sol_Install> the butterfly lady a jojo character ok
[0:53:14] <$KnivesEve> how much anime have i missed
[0:53:17] <FalcoLambda> just do the funky mode red wallbounce shenanigans level5, it's the flashiest thing you can do Kappa
[0:53:17] <+Polter_ge1st> She's a stand user
[0:53:17] <+Arnschen> Sadly
[0:53:18] <fuji_92> yeah, but it's actually good
[0:53:22] <%NecDW4> ^
[0:53:22] <%ozzrabbit> Dude, Woolie doesn't realize is, but Accel World is Awesome!
[0:53:28] <mercado94> I never watched accelworld
[0:53:31] <%NecDW4> Yeah Accel actually has real characters
[0:53:33] <+HellCopter> Marginally better
[0:53:33] <FalcoLambda> accel world is actually pretty good
[0:53:33] <Man_in_the_Red> oh look, a Persona Kappa
[0:53:35] <%galaxyswirl> wait is that true
[0:53:41] <+Polter_ge1st> @woolieversus but hey she's a stand user
[0:53:42] <+Austinck> its like a stand user mixed with king for seven deadly sins
[0:53:44] <moogleboy1984> isn't that the one where the fat shota turns into an actual pig?
[0:53:47] <%galaxyswirl> i actually liked accel world
[0:53:48] <+freeizone> similar concept; kids in online mmo
[0:53:48] <FalcoLambda> yeah, reki kawahara, who wrote SAO, also wrote accel world
[0:53:55] <hassanico1> No
[0:54:19] <CalderGaming> in true "your favorite anime is shit" style, I'm going to throw it out: almost everything dengeki bunko property represented in this game is mediocre at best, nasty at worst
[0:54:20] <sileo_patronus> A fair amount of it is translated at leasy
[0:54:28] <Guntanks_in_Space> fat shota who turns into this silver pepsiman rollerblader
[0:54:38] <hassanico1> Dengeki as a thing is just not really existing outside Japan, compared to something like Nitro+
[0:54:42] <FalcoLambda> i think all the playable roster except for ro-kyu-bu! is translated in english
[0:54:49] <+freeizone> 'your favorite fighting game is shit' Kappa
[0:54:51] <FalcoLambda> and ako's series
[0:54:56] <spardanwarrior> Accel World is the same world as SAO, but like 100 years in the future IIRC
[0:55:03] <Guntanks_in_Space> @CalderGaming you do have a point there lol. Tomoka is hilarious here, but her source anime/ln/series is ultra-abunai
[0:55:04] <Man_in_the_Red> "i hate the band you like"
[0:55:06] <FalcoLambda> yeah, it's actually a sci-fi setting
[0:55:08] <%Solidnick18> woah
[0:55:09] <fuji_92> damn, now I wanna re watch Accel World
[0:55:16] <%Solidnick18> yeah bust out the table
[0:55:22] <%FuqBoiSlim> I think Coolsville sucks
[0:55:30] <+Arnschen> Yeah, I believe Kirito created the tech the use in Accel World though.
[0:55:32] <gamma00> LUL
[0:55:47] <jonathandemel> WEEEEEEBS
[0:55:51] <Lamedhos> evoJapan
[0:55:59] <Guntanks_in_Space> ah, strike the blood
[0:55:59] <+Arnschen> It's the only connection the series has to SAO tho
[0:56:00] <CalderGaming> anyway find and watch Planet With it's gurren-lagann levels of hot-blooded mecha action and really solid in just 12 episodes
[0:56:02] <Sol_Install> LUL
[0:56:06] <%gatorafan> Are they talking french again? Kappa
[0:56:07] <gustavozxd> oh hey, sao franchise is on sale on steam, make sure to save your money and not spend any on it
[0:56:08] <Guntanks_in_Space> aka "NO SENPAI, THIS IS OUR FIGHT"

[0:56:14] <+Arnschen> Strike the Blood was alright
[0:56:16] <gordieda20> LUL
[0:56:17] <%galaxyswirl> isnt black bullet the loli murder one?
[0:56:22] <alrobot2014> yup
[0:56:23] <OldManDeckardCain> oh hey, it's the anime which author loves killing children in his works for lulz Kappa
[0:56:31] <Hakuto1> lacking weeb cirAYAYA knowledge
[0:56:33] <Ai_FGC> yeah black bullet is the loli fest anime
[0:56:33] <+Polter_ge1st> @arnschen dude don't kid yourself
[0:56:36] <@Solidus_113> Where's the Higurashi
[0:56:40] <moogleboy1984> hitscan projectiles in a fighting game
[0:56:44] <spardanwarrior> IIRC there's a chapter in one of the light novels where the protag kicks Kirito's shit in.
[0:56:48] <gamma00> everything is mediocre
[0:56:48] <FalcoLambda> i liked strike the blood!
[0:56:48] <%Solidnick18> lol
[0:56:49] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:56:50] <@Menitta> Sword Art Online? Yeah that was alright Kappa
[0:56:50] <+Austinck> is it like the opening of face off but the whole anime
[0:56:52] <Daba_mk2> Sao is shit tho
[0:56:52] <%CaptainPileDriver> light novels are fine
[0:56:54] <Guntanks_in_Space> look if we wanted higurashi
[0:56:55] <%CJett92> cept Toradora is super good tho
[0:56:55] <hntronium> Jojo was also just alright
[0:56:55] <zamzoph> Shakugan no Shana was alright
[0:56:56] <FalcoLambda> toaru and durarara kick ass though
[0:56:59] <Pnutz409> SAO. that was alright
[0:57:01] <Guntanks_in_Space> Woolie MUST bust out the OUGON MUSOU
[0:57:03] <Hakuto1> SAO abridged was alright
[0:57:04] <%CaptainPileDriver> SAO IS TRASH, next sentence
[0:57:05] <gamma00> drrr was fun
[0:57:06] <ManOfReason> sao was alright Kappa
[0:57:10] <spardanwarrior> Apparently the SAO spinoff is alright
[0:57:11] <%Solidnick18> Sao was alright to a point
[0:57:14] <fuji_92> No, Durarara and Accel are legit good
[0:57:16] <@Solidus_113> KIRITO IS A BEATER
[0:57:17] <%Tearonex> SAO that was alright... for the first season
[0:57:19] <+RichardMF_> Black bullet is about a dude hanging out with lolis
[0:57:22] <CalderGaming> magic high school would like to have a word about mary sue technology
[0:57:23] <+ViewtifulCryo> the sao abridged saved sao
[0:57:24] <moogleboy1984> CUT THAT SHIT OFF! Next anime!
[0:57:25] <+Austinck> But Toradora is amazing
[0:57:26] <%zk_nails> the ultimate in incest
[0:57:27] <mercado94> Sao Alternative? yeah it was fun
[0:57:33] <ScreamLord> SAO Abridge is better in every way
[0:57:34] <+freeizone> sounds like a classic
[0:57:34] <%CaptainPileDriver> remember, kirito's step sister with giant titties needs the dick
[0:57:36] <CalderGaming> AND ultimate incest
[0:57:38] <Baconrath> Magic School Bus PogChamp
[0:57:43] <gustavozxd> Asuna is a goddamn cuck too LUL
[0:57:43] <Pnutz409> Kirito is a virtual child labor boss
[0:57:45] <fuji_92> SAO Alternative is great
[0:57:47] <%CaptainPileDriver> THEY SHOVE CROTCH SHOTS IN THE OPENING
[0:57:48] <gordieda20> LUL
[0:57:51] <FalcoLambda> when yuuki was around in SAO, it was good, but that wasn't for very long
[0:57:53] <Man_in_the_Red> who's Gun Boy here
[0:57:57] <+ikasukiz> am I really an hour late to another Get Into Fighting Games™️ stream? NotLikeThis
[0:57:57] <%FuqBoiSlim> the only story in this game I've read is toradora and even then I only read a few chapters of the manga adaption idk what the fuck is going in with the rest
[0:57:58] <@Solidus_113> Konosuba is the only Isekai that matters

[0:59:54] <+Austinck> yugioh is the best Isekai
[0:59:56] <jonathandemel> From the same guy who made Toaru

[1:00:15] <@Menitta> LUL
[1:00:17] <hassanico1> @wolfofsound it's nuts, but turning it part edutainment works
[1:00:21] <%CJett92> The Sonic movie is gonna be a reverse isekai
[1:00:22] <%FuqBoiSlim> Narnia was an isekai too huh... woolieWUT
[1:00:24] <%Solidnick18> Wow
[1:00:25] <@Solidus_113> WOW
[1:00:26] <hassanico1> There are SEHA GIRLS
[1:00:28] <gustavozxd> @haveswordmuststing SeemsGood
[1:00:29] <+freeizone> Sonic would be kinda weird tho
[1:00:30] <%Solidnick18> that's weird
[1:00:31] <CalderGaming> anyone remember .hack//sign, the OG
[1:00:32] <gordieda20> LUL
[1:00:33] <FalcoLambda> every character has unlockable colors, including a Sega reference. the Touma support character has a Sonic color/
[1:00:33] <sileo_patronus> As degenerate as Oreimo is, it actually has writing and characters
[1:00:33] <mercado94> SEHA GIRLS
[1:00:38] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus you played on this on your previous channel, did you forget
[1:00:39] <powerprotoman> moolies biggest misunderstanding is that isekai emans mmo
[1:00:40] <cerazor01> SANIC
[1:00:40] <@Solidus_113> IF this is Sega where the fuck is Miku
[1:00:41] <Sol_Install> @CalderGaming I LOVE MY .HACK
[1:00:42] <%wolfofsound> @hassanico1 I mean it always was, they legit have good workout tips
[1:00:43] <jeffishype> What would be worse though, sonic characters fighting the anime girls or just having this stage.
[1:00:44] <fIashman92> All the stages are Sega stages
[1:00:45] <+freeizone> haha remember that time sonic kissed a human female?
[1:00:46] <+Polter_ge1st> Kirino fights with cosplay
[1:00:46] <chambatron> What is this poverty shit
[1:00:51] <@Menitta> There's a PSO stage in this game
[1:00:52] <zamzoph> @WoolieVersus They're actually like cousins so it's okay
[1:00:52] <hassanico1> SEHA Girls only show up in story mode though
[1:00:54] <EndarkCuli> @Austinck I can't tell whether you're being comical or referring to the arc where Tea duelled a penguin
[1:00:55] <%gatorafan> Will Woolie realize how many SEGA stages are in here?
[1:00:55] <fuji_92> I'm playing Hack gu right now
[1:00:58] <+Arnschen> dot hack is a great series
[1:01:01] <%gatorafan> The answer is no, he won't Kappa
[1:01:02] <%CJett92> Please kick Kirino's ass
[1:01:09] <cerazor01> This is Japan poverty this is
[1:01:19] <357Sneak> zyzxWaa ?
[1:01:19] <Guntanks_in_Space> this ain't even true poverty yet
[1:01:21] <gustavozxd> is it worth it to play the original .hack before GU?
[1:01:22] <+freeizone> kirino was top before, maybe nerfed
[1:01:23] <Ai_FGC> oh i forgot mashiro was an assist in this
[1:01:25] <%CaptainPileDriver> nah, we watch reggie and woolie play weekly, it can't be any worse then them
[1:01:27] <Guntanks_in_Space> until Woolie streams Melty from his backyard
[1:01:27] <sileo_patronus> If you win then you're playing correctly
[1:01:30] <chambatron> Hey chat how long do these streams last on Tuesday?
[1:01:33] <chambatron> !uptime
[1:01:33] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 6 minutes
[1:01:34] <Man_in_the_Red> @cerazor01 do you even B Tatsu
[1:01:39] <+the38bandit> Didnt Kirino actually get together with her brother at the end?
[1:01:40] <@Menitta> Holy shit that chip is insanwe
[1:01:46] <CalderGaming> @powerprotoman can you blame him tho [gestures to a pile of isekai] even Slime gave the gary sue MMO-style powers even though he took the death/reincarnation route
[1:01:48] <+knackirontarkus> Melty in the Denny’s parking lot let’s go
[1:01:50] <%CJett92> @WAIRIR10R yes
[1:01:51] <%FuqBoiSlim> we had western poverty last time so it's only fair we get japanese poverty this stream
[1:01:51] <cerazor01> yes
[1:01:53] <jonathandemel> @WAIRIR10R Yeh, incest route is canon
[1:01:55] <+Austinck> @EndarkCuli yes that penguin who was an old man wanted that young Japanese girl body
[1:01:57] <cerazor01> she did
[1:01:58] <buffmiku> Nice to see boogiepop getting some love
[1:02:03] <jeffishype> . isnt sham-show out?
[1:02:04] <Guntanks_in_Space> what was the western poverty last stream? @FuqBoiSlim
[1:02:05] <chronoxgp> !uptime
[1:02:05] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 7 minutes
[1:02:06] <fuji_92> @gustavozxd yeah, but the last recode has a way for you to catch up... you're gonna lose some context but not much...
[1:02:06] <+freeizone> @WAIRIR10R 'not blood related' PogChamp
[1:02:06] <FalcoLambda> pushblock is any 2 attack buttons while blocking.
[1:02:13] <FalcoLambda> B+C is the best combination to choose because if you mash A+B you may accidentally use one of your punishable reversal moves
[1:02:17] <+the38bandit> Wow lmao
[1:02:18] <Man_in_the_Red> @jeffishype SamSho is released and it is grear
[1:02:22] <%wolfofsound> Listen chat Japan REALLY needs you to fuck. If it has to be relatives then so be it, but they need babies numbers up
[1:02:24] <Jathspuh> Use Accelerator
[1:02:24] <%FuqBoiSlim> @guntanks_in_space fantasy strike or something
[1:02:34] <hassanico1> Kirino's damage seems low
[1:02:35] <Guntanks_in_Space> oh god fantasy strike. SIRLIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIM
[1:02:38] <Guntanks_in_Space> SIRLIN*
[1:02:43] <%CJett92> @wolfofsound but mai waifu tho
[1:02:44] <hassanico1> Oh wait Woolie is playing a boss again
[1:02:51] <FalcoLambda> do the ufo catcher super
[1:03:01] <sileo_patronus> @hassanico1 damage seems low in general tbh
[1:03:04] <%wolfofsound> @CJett92 Hey if you want to put a mask over the girl that's fine just slam her till she's preggers
[1:03:07] <jonathandemel> Why do Japanese series always try to justify incest with the whole "not blood-related" thing. Just make them full on sibling-diddlers, it's not real, it's ok
[1:03:09] <TheBrunoZone> @wolfofsound How could anyone argue with that logiv?
[1:03:14] <%galaxyswirl> WAIT
[1:03:16] <mercado94> @wolfofsound shut up Abe I don't want kids!
[1:03:20] <TheBrunoZone> *logic
[1:03:24] <%CJett92> @wolfofsound you know what thats fair
[1:03:30] <%galaxyswirl> is that the autistic girl from the pet light novel?
[1:03:35] <FalcoLambda> yeah
[1:03:36] <gustavozxd> @jonathandemel oh the non blood related thing doesn't happen as often as you'd think LUL
[1:03:44] <%galaxyswirl> whats the name of it?
[1:03:49] <cerazor01> this makes me uncomfortable
[1:03:49] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[1:03:51] <FalcoLambda> the pet girl of sakurasou
[1:03:57] <ScreamLord> Gun Lance will reign supreme
[1:04:00] <%wolfofsound> I mean do you guys remember the story where the guy marries the little girl he raised who saw him as a father?
[1:04:00] <countgaculatv> YO SHE WENT IN
[1:04:00] <gustavozxd> PET GIRL
[1:04:00] <%galaxyswirl> thats it!
[1:04:00] <%FuqBoiSlim> cuz you can mary your cousin in Japan but not your blood-related sibling
[1:04:05] <jonathandemel> @gustavozxd I see it a shitload in the ones where they actually go into it
[1:04:08] <%Solidnick18> woolieWUT
[1:04:08] <Guntanks_in_Space> also on that tangent of Samsho, there was a stream of it here several weeks ago with the brother LordJimmyBones lol
[1:04:11] <+Polter_ge1st> Hit em with the Crane Game Super
[1:04:16] <FalcoLambda> weird that i remembered that off the top of my head
[1:04:16] <jonathandemel> @FuqBoiSlim BUT IT'S NOT REAL
[1:04:17] <Guntanks_in_Space> it was a beautiful stream
[1:04:19] <+freeizone> the sequel was better
[1:04:25] <%FuqBoiSlim> @jonathandemel BUT THE LAWS
[1:04:27] <%wolfofsound> @FuqBoiSlim just tell them it's a half sister
[1:04:37] <$KnivesEve> boss characters are no match to the power of the imouto
[1:04:42] <%CJett92> uuuuuuuuuggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhh
[1:04:43] <FalcoLambda> THEREIT IS
[1:04:45] <gordieda20> LUL
[1:04:46] <%FuqBoiSlim> @wolfofsound nah, they still share on parent. it's too close for Abe
[1:04:54] <%CJett92> worst girl always wins
[1:04:55] <+Austinck> im surpized no one from highschool dxd isn't in this
[1:05:09] <+freeizone> same publisher?
[1:05:10] <jonathandemel> @Austinck DxD is dengeki bunko?
[1:05:12] <mercado94> Abe doesn't care
[1:05:13] <Man_in_the_Red> Look at this Mugen shit
[1:05:16] <@Solidus_113> Reggie, it's not Daddy. It's Onii-chan
[1:05:17] <Guntanks_in_Space> was DXD a Dengeki thing?
[1:05:25] <sileo_patronus> Aw no kuroko I guess
[1:05:28] <gustavozxd> is the name of this game's currency CP? LUL
[1:05:32] <Guntanks_in_Space> ^
[1:05:32] <jonathandemel> Shana=
[1:05:35] <+Polter_ge1st> LAB KIRITO
[1:05:36] <gustavozxd> of all the games
[1:05:43] <fuji_92> LAB KIRITO LUL
[1:05:43] <Guntanks_in_Space> oh god lol i forgot GODTIER ONIICHAN was here
[1:05:45] <%wolfofsound> oh shitshitshitshit japanese jesus is in this game?!
[1:05:50] <+Jotamide> Reminder that Sega won't localize this, or Blade Arcus Rebellion, or make VF6
[1:05:56] <Guntanks_in_Space> yeah JESUS ONIICHAN is here
[1:05:56] <%FuqBoiSlim> Kiss X Sis > OreImo you know I'm right chat
[1:06:01] <dreamcastiszombie> anime akira WutFace
[1:06:03] <+Polter_ge1st> Show them the easy bake combos
[1:06:04] <%wolfofsound> he has the power of GUN
[1:06:09] <Guntanks_in_Space> @FuqBoiSlim i loath Oreimo enough to actually agree with you lol
[1:06:12] <Gurbetsjov> PICK HOLO
[1:06:15] <+freeizone> weird they only localized the previous version?
[1:06:25] <Guntanks_in_Space> yeah this came out only JP and never on PC either
[1:06:32] <KitsuneManami> Selvaria for Life
[1:06:37] <gustavozxd> the fact that there's a discussion between the two degenerate incest anime is the worst
[1:06:39] <Guntanks_in_Space> when Blade Strangers and the other examu/french bread 2d anime fighters did
[1:06:39] <+Jotamide> @8framelag They literally released it 2 months before Ignition was released in Japan
[1:06:48] <FalcoLambda> your blast character increases the size of the burst they represent, if you press start/option when hovering over them, you can change what blast they affect manually
[1:06:50] <+freeizone> probably didn't sell enough and annoying to deal with licensing?
[1:06:51] <didgereedoodah> I didn't know Virtua Fighter was poverty anime
[1:06:52] <+Jotamide> Sega of Japan give no fucks what NA or EU do
[1:07:08] <Guntanks_in_Space> realistically, yea
[1:07:13] <Man_in_the_Red> @didgereedoodah it is now doodSad
[1:07:14] <+Austinck> nope higschool dxd not published by them
[1:07:24] <gustavozxd> oh yeah there's a PSO lobby stage now that I remember
[1:07:32] <FalcoLambda> yeah, the shop area
[1:07:33] <dreamcastiszombie> i'm confused BibleThump

[1:08:25] <chronoxgp> i have the regular version of this game it's meh
[1:08:53] <Guntanks_in_Space> thanks, wool
[1:08:57] <ike_shamus> Ignition made the game good imo
[1:09:00] <jonathandemel> Real MVP
[1:09:02] <ike_shamus> i hated vanilla
[1:09:09] <Guntanks_in_Space> vanilla is weeeeeeeeeeeeeird
[1:09:14] <%Wool> Page 2 is the health/meter shit
[1:09:49] <+Polter_ge1st> @ike_shamus vanilla was unbalanced as all hell
[1:09:51] <memenavy> What's up everyone?
[1:09:55] <+freeizone> moonrunes
[1:10:10] <jonathandemel> DON'T HIT THE LOLI
[1:10:12] <Bamcc2> Is that Akira?
[1:10:15] <ike_shamus> vanilla was not fun to play
[1:10:17] <FalcoLambda> yes
[1:10:17] <memenavy> yep
[1:10:17] <sileo_patronus> Oh she's bait, that makes sense
[1:10:19] <Guntanks_in_Space> wasn't vanilla DFC riddled with uhh, Kirino vs Taiga all day
[1:10:24] <FalcoLambda> vanilla is just a barebones fighting game
[1:10:27] <Guntanks_in_Space> all i know was Kirino was dumb
[1:10:34] <FalcoLambda> kirino was very very strong
[1:10:35] <+freeizone> isn't the meta mostly the same from 1? shana/kirino?
[1:10:41] <Guntanks_in_Space> maybe Shana and Taiga too
[1:10:46] <FalcoLambda> kirino's still strong just not as strong
[1:10:52] <anarchistPastry> @Bamcc2 yup
[1:10:53] <KitsuneManami> Just play Selvaria
[1:10:53] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:11:00] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> game has Taiga Aisaka, game is good
[1:11:11] <+Polter_ge1st> I remember cheesing with Easy Kirito combos lol
[1:11:36] <@Menitta> that shit has made me consider getting a 2nd arcade stick with a pad
[1:11:40] <jonathandemel> BOUCE
[1:12:06] <chronoxgp> i bought it because the waiter from dardarara was in it, but there arent any defense options it's all attack
[1:12:23] <ike_shamus> Akira/Erio(futon girl) are a good team
[1:12:30] <Guntanks_in_Space> his super is the goddamn Stun Palm of Doom
[1:12:43] <Guntanks_in_Space> also his other is VF2 GATTLING JAB
[1:12:47] <Guntanks_in_Space> i just realized
[1:13:05] <+Polter_ge1st> @guntanks_in_space yup yup
[1:13:28] <+freeizone> pushblock is free.. when in climax or lower life?
[1:13:42] <FalcoLambda> yeah
[1:13:52] <FalcoLambda> if your opponent has the life lead, your pushblock is free
[1:14:07] <FalcoLambda> also note that when you have lower health, a little light at the bottom of your lifebar turns on
[1:14:21] <+ucbigdrifter210ap> ss launcher?
[1:14:35] <FalcoLambda> good to keep in mind when the round is running out of time and both players are neck on neck
[1:14:54] <sileo_patronus> @FalcoLambda oh that white notch?
[1:14:57] <FalcoLambda> yeah!
[1:15:00] <sileo_patronus> neat
[1:15:06] <+Dull_Fangs> looool we're playing this
[1:15:10] <FalcoLambda> this game has lots of neat small QoL details
[1:15:37] <sileo_patronus> Now if only it had the bigger QoL detail of being in more than one language
[1:15:59] <FalcoLambda> i've become accustomed to JP releases at this point, but i totally get it
[1:16:01] <+Dull_Fangs> this is a pre FBM game
[1:16:25] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> the weeb carries you if you believe enough, multiple languages are therefore clearly superfluous
[1:16:39] <+Dull_Fangs> they were saving up money to bribe wizard for this year
[1:16:42] <chronoxgp> is pushblock in the base US game?
[1:16:43] <FalcoLambda> the training mode is the only real issue if you're worried about language
[1:16:52] <+Dull_Fangs> reverse beat is a FB staple
[1:16:56] <FalcoLambda> the other menus are either easy to tell or are just straight up in english
[1:17:14] <+Dull_Fangs> actually is this a four button game with C being ex moves
[1:17:32] <FalcoLambda> A+B is EX
[1:17:36] <+Dull_Fangs> huh
[1:17:39] <FalcoLambda> ABC are light medium heavy
[1:17:45] <+Dull_Fangs> is D tag
[1:17:50] <FalcoLambda> assist, yeah
[1:17:54] <Guntanks_in_Space> A+B is usually the uh, armored/invincible reversal no?
[1:17:54] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:18:04] <sileo_patronus> And A+B is on R1 yeah?
[1:18:08] <FalcoLambda> yeah, guntanks, but if you do a special input before the AB you get an EX move
[1:18:10] <Sol_Install> okay maybe it just me but sounds a bit like BBTag then but that's just me
[1:18:13] <FalcoLambda> idk about macros
[1:18:22] <Guntanks_in_Space> oh that explains shit
[1:18:29] <Guntanks_in_Space> there are command normals i believe
[1:18:51] <FalcoLambda> it's not similar to BBTAG at all, if you go in expecting it to be like BBTAG you won't get it
[1:19:19] <+Dull_Fangs> this game has OG assets for one
[1:19:26] <FalcoLambda> LUL
[1:19:28] <sileo_patronus> Assists seem to come in pretty fast and loose
[1:19:51] <FalcoLambda> people are actually speculating that this game will get added to TAG
[1:19:55] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> the sprites do look rather nice
[1:20:07] <FalcoLambda> they look slightly cleaner than UNIST sprites
[1:20:25] <Guntanks_in_Space> i mean, this was a french bread jam right?
[1:20:31] <chronoxgp> ah well apparently this game has a game manuel and it's deeper thnan what i thought
[1:20:31] <sileo_patronus> But UNIST's style though
[1:20:32] <Man_in_the_Red> @falcolambda more likely than Senran Kagura
[1:20:32] <FalcoLambda> yeah! sega + french bread
[1:20:37] <+Dull_Fangs> what
[1:20:42] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> no wonder then
[1:20:42] <+Dull_Fangs> this is just LN characters
[1:20:46] <Guntanks_in_Space> yeah
[1:20:47] <+Anonymasque> Is that Akira
[1:20:53] <Guntanks_in_Space> LN characters, and Akira (and Selvaria)
[1:21:04] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> and taiga, and shana?
[1:21:19] <Guntanks_in_Space> don't those two have LNs?
[1:21:25] <FalcoLambda> yeah, they're LNs
[1:21:28] <+Dull_Fangs> btw did who ever is playing end up going to Climax of the Night
[1:21:29] <+Polter_ge1st> Don't forget Quarter Circle forward ABC to do Powered Up Super that takes 2 bar and a Trump card
[1:21:33] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> and...wait is durarara a ln?
[1:21:40] <@Menitta> Did anyone rip this Akira sprite into a Mugen character

[1:22:54] <+Dull_Fangs> hey speaking of VC how good was 4
[1:22:55] <+Polter_ge1st> Lab Kirito and his easy bake Rekas
[1:22:57] <+freeizone> remember using asuna in this game
[1:23:03] <sileo_patronus> You think I'm weak? I don't need light, give me the heavy novel
[1:23:07] <Guntanks_in_Space> wait wasn't Asuna also ap opular pick at the time?
[1:23:08] <memenavy> If only people knew what this is from
[1:23:11] <FalcoLambda> it's a Sega Hard Girls stage!
[1:23:12] <memenavy> NEVERMIND
[1:23:12] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> was that a duckin sonic stage or is the sleep deprivation kicking in
[1:23:17] <+Polter_ge1st> Sega Hard Girls
[1:23:18] <mercado94> IT IS
[1:23:20] <Kalcom> is that sans
[1:23:21] <FalcoLambda> so woolie recognizing it light that is completely right
[1:23:21] <+Dull_Fangs> bruh sega hard drive girls in this game would be GL
[1:23:28] <%FuqBoiSlim> Woolie Vs Bayonetta part 2 is out woolieGASM
[1:23:32] <Guntanks_in_Space> one school says chao, the other gaskwang?
[1:23:46] <Man_in_the_Red> @fuqboislim YT push notifications on point
[1:23:54] <%FuqBoiSlim> chao-see-oh-nay
[1:23:55] <+Dull_Fangs> hey speaking of Anime has woolie talked about how Akiohko now has a 6f over head in BBTag
[1:24:25] <FalcoLambda> akihiko's like top 5 in BBTAG right now as well, dude's insane
[1:24:36] <%Wool> Akihiko has some dummy thicc damage in BBTag
[1:24:40] <+Dull_Fangs> truly pachi's greatest work
[1:24:45] <Sol_Install> akihiko went from a car into a fucking rail gun
[1:24:57] <%FuqBoiSlim> Woolie must be proud a character he likes is actually top tier for once
[1:24:58] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[1:24:58] <+Dull_Fangs> no but it cost one bar
[1:25:03] <+Dull_Fangs> balance
[1:25:19] <%badmr7> badmr7 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! nice stream Woolie!
[1:25:32] <+Dull_Fangs> @FuqBoiSlim man was going to play Virgil in MvC3 if he was dog shit
[1:25:42] <+Dull_Fangs> and he played Zero regardless
[1:25:58] <+Anonymasque> What is this crossover madness??
[1:26:21] <+Dull_Fangs> And Baiken was pretty good in AC
[1:26:22] <Pnutz409> old man fingers
[1:26:27] <chronoxgp> this game was 40 bucks after a couple of months
[1:26:27] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> woolie dies on stream from anime overdose
[1:26:38] <+Dull_Fangs> Esports is a young man's game
[1:26:43] <MimicTheDragon> Put Selvaria in VF6 Kappa
[1:27:06] <+Dull_Fangs> he also played dumb ass Makoto in 3S
[1:27:29] <+ikasukiz> you got characters from Sword Art Online... and a bunch of other series from the same light novel publisher. Also Sega pbulsihed this game so there's a bunch of Sega-themed content including two playable characters
[1:27:34] <+ikasukiz> @Anonymasque
[1:27:50] <+Dull_Fangs> bruh
[1:27:51] <ike_shamus> no IB in this game
[1:28:04] <ike_shamus> Selv is not good in this game FYI
[1:28:14] <+Dull_Fangs> projectiles with follow ups
[1:28:28] <ike_shamus> its punishable
[1:28:40] <+Dull_Fangs> Hyde aint shit now
[1:29:37] <+Anonymasque> @ikasukiz Thanks for the deets.
[1:29:40] <+freeizone> didn't this crossover come about by; Dengeki wanting anniversary/promotion and Sega contacting FB to make a new game for Club Sega Arcades
[1:30:00] <+Anonymasque> Jesus why doesn't this come up when people talk about Smash?
[1:30:00] <Guntanks_in_Space> pretty much
[1:30:12] <+Dull_Fangs> is UNI even in Club sega
[1:30:27] <Guntanks_in_Space> UNI runs on Sega's arcade hadware no? it should be lol
[1:30:27] <%FuqBoiSlim> I wish more anime got 2d fighters instead of the arena brawlers I'm pissed about the opm game. In a better world Genos would be doing sick trillion damage mvc combos pknFBM
[1:30:49] <%FuqBoiSlim> bring back tvc
[1:30:51] <Man_in_the_Red> @fuqboislim that Tier list must be simple LUL
[1:31:01] <+Dull_Fangs> Is battle arena (the main UNI arcade) a club sega affiliate
[1:31:06] <+freeizone> gotta bring back marvel first PogChamp
[1:31:19] <+Dull_Fangs> TvC is the GoaT don't @ me
[1:31:25] <goose_attack_almanac> ...Valkyria Chronicles is great
[1:31:26] <Man_in_the_Red> @dull_fangs @
[1:31:29] <+Wynzler> I blame CyberConnect
[1:31:33] <+Dull_Fangs> fuck u birch
[1:31:37] <%FuqBoiSlim> @haveswordmuststing I'm not sure saitama's a character I think hes just the dummy in training mode
[1:31:43] <Man_in_the_Red> @wynzler blame Bandai Namco
[1:31:53] <+Wynzler> Them too
[1:31:59] <+Anonymasque> Yeah! Teach that Asuna a lesson!!
[1:32:00] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:32:10] <Pnutz409> when's Kirito? Kappa
[1:32:12] <+Dull_Fangs> blame spries being hard to do too
[1:32:21] <@Menitta> I dont like the scaling of this stage
[1:32:21] <Man_in_the_Red> @pnutz409 never suprisingly enough
[1:32:32] <ike_shamus> also, for that asuna combo, pickup with 2a not 5ab
[1:32:34] <+Wynzler> Harder to do than 3d models?
[1:32:37] <+freeizone> and xrd looking great
[1:32:47] <Pnutz409> lol @Wynzler
[1:33:02] <Pnutz409> Play some Pokken.
[1:33:05] <+Wynzler> I'm asking because I don't actually know, I'm ignorant
[1:33:07] <squiddo_the_kiddo> Yo how do I get in on this
[1:33:11] <theangryguyofde> I remember the first game people said every character had the same frame data. Bad time to play Taiga LUL
[1:33:14] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> oh yeah, pokken exists
[1:33:21] <@Menitta> everyone should play pokken
[1:33:23] <squiddo_the_kiddo> DFCI is my favorite FG
[1:33:28] <+Wynzler> Pokken is wasted potential imo
[1:33:37] <@Menitta> Its the best Pokemon game on Switch
[1:33:41] <Pnutz409> Wasted? its fun af
[1:33:50] <+Dull_Fangs> From a support view or just form a game play perspective
[1:33:55] <+freeizone> maybe not harder just time consuming and less dedicated sprite artists (not lo-fi 4/8bit)
[1:33:59] <deafmelone> whens Digikken? Kappa
[1:34:01] <+Wynzler> Both
[1:34:06] <sileo_patronus> I'd like Pokken more if it didn't have the goofy top-down mode
[1:34:06] <lemon_lore> o players?
[1:34:09] <+Polter_ge1st> Play Kirito Against him
[1:34:09] <+Dull_Fangs> KSB still holds it down
[1:34:11] <%Wool> 1
[1:34:13] <CrippledRoach> 1
[1:34:15] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> it has tsundere braixen so it's worth something at least
[1:34:15] <BlueEmerald> 1
[1:34:15] <ike_shamus> 1
[1:34:16] <Hoshikori0> 1
[1:34:19] <Pnutz409> scene is still stronk.
[1:34:21] <%FuqBoiSlim> I'll give Pokken props for giving my boy Chandelure some shine but i remember playing it on the wii u and not being big on it
[1:34:29] <+Polter_ge1st> Best him with Kirito
[1:34:30] <Man_in_the_Red> can we just update Pokken to have 800 playable pokemon and call it a day Kappa
[1:34:33] <%CaptainPileDriver> i'm not
[1:34:38] <+Dull_Fangs> Didn't it have a varible frame rate on Wii U
[1:34:40] <+Anonymasque> This game isn't available for PS4 in Eng huh?
[1:34:42] <%CaptainPileDriver> i'm not getting this japanese account
[1:34:54] <%Wool> This is literally my first time playing but I'll win through sheer anime fundamentals.
[1:34:55] <Pnutz409> Use Kirito lol
[1:34:59] <ike_shamus> i put it on blast in the DFCI discord
[1:35:00] <%CaptainPileDriver> it was 20 bucks how could i not
[1:35:01] <deafmelone> PokkenXDigikken
[1:35:04] <FalcoLambda> i have this game and a JP account but i don't feel good about going up against him since i'm in the UK
[1:35:06] <+Dull_Fangs> When's Koiheme
[1:35:12] <+Dull_Fangs> you cowards
[1:35:13] <@Menitta> So Wool is basically saying "Yeah I dont even play this game"
[1:35:19] <FalcoLambda> i'm wired up but the connection might still not be good
[1:35:19] <CrippledRoach> Damn it, lol.

[1:50:04] <Pnutz409> does she do Mother's Rosario?
[1:50:08] <squiddo_the_kiddo> Yuuki is the best before assists come into play tho
[1:50:13] <TigerClaws12> is this the game that has Iori in it?
[1:50:15] <ike_shamus> I picked up yuuki two weeks ago, i played asuna prior

[1:50:29] <TigerClaws12> oh ok

[2:00:36] <%FuqBoiSlim> I like log horizon season 1 cuz the characters only get shit done because an anime girl told them to and that really spoke to me on a spiritual level
[2:00:37] <hntronium> Shoulda made Jesus a girl

[2:02:24] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> fate has been half half with turning indian and chinese deities and heroes into the opposite gender, so who knows when it comes to jesus...Solomon remained male tho

[2:19:55] <Pnutz409> pso!
[2:19:56] <cerazor01> ? Endlag?
[2:20:00] <+chrishnaw> I keep hearing stories from people who claim they played PSO on GameCube
[2:20:02] <Tekaii00> Pso2 still has this lobby lol
[2:20:14] <FalcoLambda> to be fair about smash players calling recovery endlag, they have an acual thing in their game called a recovery
[2:20:15] <cerazor01> Isn't pso2 being released in English?
[2:20:15] <Guntanks_in_Space> PSO was on gamecube iirc
[2:20:21] <@Menitta> If you didnt play with the gamecube keyboard, you cannot say you have played video games
[2:20:23] <FalcoLambda> so they should ideally be differentiating the two
[2:20:25] <+801braxton> pso2 is actualy garbage
[2:20:27] <zamzoph> Shana PunOko
[2:20:27] <chronoxgp> pso2 on xbox 1
[2:20:28] <Guntanks_in_Space> i think a private server was based on that
[2:20:34] <ike_shamus> Abister is scary, makes me look like i dont know how to play the game

[2:32:30] <Guntanks_in_Space> i thought those were sprites. less noticeable 3D compared to say, Shining Blade Arcus
[2:32:30] <Man_in_the_Red> this game does in fact, have Nooch
[2:32:33] <@Menitta> if they're 3D then someone went through all the trouble to put em in mugen...

[2:32:49] <fIashman92> She's 14. Much better
[2:32:50] <cerazor01> I like the ingame model/sprites
[2:32:54] <CalderGaming> this is Yue Jin vs. Sun Shangxiang

[2:33:16] <@Menitta> Ooooh ok that makes sense
[2:33:20] <%SilentRukei> Man her fireball sure reminds me of a certain Japanese spies fireball
[2:33:28] <Nick_Degica> I'd play but everyone would just wreck me badly
[2:33:55] <countgaculatv> Oh shit you're playing this.

[2:35:54] <Guntanks_in_Space> if you counterhit with it, it launches big iirc
[2:35:58] <%CaptainPileDriver> REGGIE, DP MOTION IS A GRAB
[2:35:59] <+freeizone> unconventional mechanics needs niche corefan base - probably why it doesn't cater to mainstream aesthetics
[2:36:24] <+ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> Yeah, that's prolly why it's so gross, @CaptainPileDriver . Good point
[2:36:35] <%CaptainPileDriver> lol, ikr?
[2:36:56] <Omgbasedjay> Wooliwoooo
[2:36:57] <%CaptainPileDriver> the super is basically samsho's super motion

[2:37:23] <%SilentRukei> Wtf?

[2:50:46] <%CaptainPileDriver> god, it feels like the cops are gonna show up with the noises made from this game
[2:51:06] <+Jotamide> The devs for this game are doglike
[2:51:19] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> He's a Corrections Officer
[2:51:22] <+Jotamide> I hope their next game has a better / more recognizable IP tied to it
[2:51:34] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> ya'll scrubs are UNDER ARREST
[2:51:34] <mr_slaide> Kind of... It's a gender bender anime fighter game based on the RoTK characters.
[2:51:51] <mr_slaide> Oh no! Under arrest again!
[2:52:00] <%RyuuAoi> EAT SHIT
[2:52:02] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> FUCK the Romance of the 3 Kingdoms
[2:52:13] <+PressXtoGout> forsenLewd
[2:52:14] <mr_slaide> Although, to be honest, this series started as a hentai series...
[2:52:15] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> STOP IT JAPAN its not COOL ANYMORE
[2:52:26] <%SilentRukei> Is RoTK worth it?
[2:52:35] <Nick_Degica> The funny thing is the most fun thing to see, the juggle combos, are almost never seen at high level just because you don't see people get gonged often.
[2:52:41] <RunningNGunning> Rules for tournaments for this game should have everyone who loses in pools immediately gets arrested by the FBI
[2:52:41] <+Jotamide> There's tons of fighting games based on eroge
[2:52:46] <mr_slaide> Depends. The Dynasty warrior series? The RoTK strategy games?
[2:52:46] <%SilentRukei> Asking for a friend?
[2:52:52] <mr_slaide> The book?
[2:52:54] <+Jotamide> Big Bang Beat, Alice Senki, Melty counts too
[2:52:59] <%SilentRukei> The Book
[2:53:08] <FalcoLambda> i'm gonna take it easy for the night, you guys take care
[2:53:10] <Zeroroute> Fate Unlimited Codes
[2:53:14] <Dlent_> Lu Bu on the left
[2:53:22] <Guntanks_in_Space> Fate Unlimited Codes da gawd
[2:53:31] <mr_slaide> What is your friend tolerance level for exaggerated "historical" stories?
[2:53:33] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @FalcoLambda You can take it as easy as you want, cause you're FREE
[2:53:49] <Nick_Degica> I just call it gong because of the sound
[2:53:53] <katocrimson> cao cao is proud of what his legacy has become
[2:53:56] <FalcoLambda> BIbleThump why do people have to tell me things i already know

[2:54:09] <FalcoLambda> i've made a habit of consistently fucking that emote up BibleThump
[2:54:16] <Guntanks_in_Space> i actually assumed the fatal counters here were called Gongs
[2:54:20] <FalcoLambda> anyway good night <3
[2:54:26] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> because we all get reminded of our scrubness
[2:54:28] <%jubejube56> There is something weird about the animation in this game
[2:54:29] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> night
[2:54:31] <%SilentRukei> @mr_slaide I'll just say Fate takes exaggerated history too far sometimes imo
[2:54:33] <%jubejube56> reminds me of Mortal Kombat
[2:54:42] <Nick_Degica> Those are the three typse of juggles you can do during a gong. you can't repeat one. I really like that they added those in RyoRaiRai (the indicators)
[2:54:52] <justanotherbambi> My first ever arcade stick came in today :)
[2:54:54] <nmeira> @WoolieVersus hey whatsup woolie, do you still keep in contact with the sleepycabin guys?
[2:54:54] <+Jotamide> 3B/6B/6C are the Hougeki buttons
[2:55:04] <+Jotamide> 3C is not the best starter
[2:55:19] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> You want exagerated history? look at One Piece... I don't think anything about Devils Fruit is historically accurate
[2:55:21] <mr_slaide> @SilentRukei Oh, it's nowhere near as exaggerated as Fate. It's more realistic and somewhat based on history. Is your friend remotely knowledgeable on that era?
[2:55:32] <%SilentRukei> Nope
[2:55:41] <Dlent_> 3C is occasionally special cancel, so it can be a safer move to use
[2:55:44] <%rumtumtugnutz> rumtumtugnutz subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! T
[2:55:50] <mr_slaide> One Piece is fantasy. It's not historical.
[2:55:50] <+PressXtoGout> forsenThink mahvel huh
[2:55:57] <LoveXKnife> tiddy samsho
[2:56:00] <+Jotamide> Kan'u 3C sucks tho lol
[2:56:09] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @mr_slaide tell that to Japan, its basically a religion
[2:56:10] <Guntanks_in_Space> more like tiddy ROTK SF4
[2:56:23] <Guntanks_in_Space> or at least that's what the internet called it at one point
[2:56:27] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> SF4 was already pretty Tiddy
[2:56:34] <mr_slaide> @Breakfast_Megapowers Yeah, but even they know it's purely fantasy.
[2:56:35] <%jubejube56> I feel like One Piece needs to end in modern day
[2:56:35] <Guntanks_in_Space> i mean, you're not wrong lol
[2:56:40] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> I mean damn Ken

[2:57:11] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @Guntanks_in_Space I've seen that Hentai
[2:57:16] <Applecannon63> One Piece is just Pirate's Tales mixed with Japan Folktale
[2:57:33] <$SWFanatic> Whos Armin with boobs?
[2:57:48] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> and has some historical real world pirates for some reason?
[2:57:49] <+Jotamide> :u Bu
[2:57:50] <mr_slaide> It's the character based on Lu Bu.
[2:57:52] <Guntanks_in_Space> Lube Bu
[2:57:53] <+Jotamide> Lu Bu*
[2:57:56] <Guntanks_in_Space> Ryofu if you will
[2:58:00] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Lube UU
[2:58:07] <mr_slaide> Bring back Lube Bu.
[2:58:25] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> You can't bring him back, he's too slippery
[2:58:36] <mr_slaide> Lube Bu for Summer Slam.
[2:58:37] <Nick_Degica> Ryofu is a beast.
[2:58:53] <Applecannon63> Oh yeah One Piece has character's face based on celebrities
[2:59:10] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Well I mean more like Edward Teach
[2:59:13] <+PressXtoGout> forsenLewd forsenKnife
[2:59:34] <Dlent_> Assists are plus
[2:59:36] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Blackbeard is a real character in One Piece and is the main villain?
[2:59:43] <Dlent_> Ex moves are always unsafe
[2:59:44] <%mighty_max_t> Isn't Minoru Suzuki just in one Piece? Like AS himself?
[2:59:46] <mr_slaide> Kind of...
[2:59:54] <katocrimson> lu bu vs sun jian
[2:59:54] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> idk anymore
[2:59:58] <mr_slaide> I think he will be the "end boss".
[3:00:08] <mr_slaide> He's already kinda broken.
[3:00:26] <Guntanks_in_Space> yeah wasn't lu bu the boss in the previous revision of this
[3:00:36] <Applecannon63> I mean he took White Beard's power
[3:00:36] <Guntanks_in_Space> @MightyMaxT i've seen that picture
[3:00:37] <+PressXtoGout> 75 frame hit confirm PogChamp
[3:00:38] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> I think One Piece will end in a royale rumble fashion with Luffy Kaidou, Aizawa and Teach
[3:01:17] <%SilentRukei> why are there two open slots on the assist select?
[3:01:18] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Marineford 2 if you will
[3:01:20] <Guntanks_in_Space> oh hey it's sun quan, the character i actually liked playing here- oh they didn't pick her

[3:02:01] <mr_slaide> Already read it. Have the old tv and new tv series.
[3:02:03] <Applecannon63> no sun wukong?
[3:02:06] <Guntanks_in_Space> but instead of mowing down dynasty warriors footsoldiers, you're all tiddy fighters
[3:02:12] <Applecannon63> or Zhu Bajie
[3:02:14] <Guntanks_in_Space> isn't Lu Bu weak to grapplers then
[3:02:22] <Guntanks_in_Space> especially ones with Ropes and Pillars
[3:02:29] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> not if he's Lube Buu
[3:02:30] <hntronium> This isn't journey to the west my man
[3:02:40] <Guntanks_in_Space> Lube Bu could have slipped away from that trap
[3:02:41] <mr_slaide> What hntronium said.
[3:02:50] <Applecannon63> ah
[3:03:17] <+parrotman01> You would play this game
[3:03:25] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> I wouldn't
[3:03:50] <hntronium> But would you play the VN
[3:03:50] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[3:03:55] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> I can barely care about Def Jam
[3:04:10] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> and I only care because of the SUPER MOVES
[3:04:12] <dero45> Is this just Sengoku basara with lolis
[3:04:24] <Guntanks_in_Space> more like Dynasty Warriors but Lolis
[3:04:36] <hntronium> Sengloli Bashota
[3:04:36] <mr_slaide> What Guntanks said.
[3:05:00] <Guntanks_in_Space> there was a Warring States but Lolis series though, but i forgot what that was called
[3:05:06] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Come on, Def Jam: World Under your Feet for PS5
[3:05:10] <mr_slaide> Series started as a hentai though.
[3:05:13] <dero45> But basara is anime dynasty warriors
[3:05:21] <hntronium> I don't remember lolis but Sengoku Rance is porn warring states
[3:05:26] <+PressXtoGout> PogChamp
[3:05:34] <Guntanks_in_Space> yeah i may have been thinking of Rance lol
[3:05:37] <MaxXtreme23> what the fuck did i walk into
[3:05:40] <mr_slaide> Not same era, not same country.
[3:05:51] <dero45> @mr_slaide I knew I recognized the art style
[3:05:55] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @MaxXtreme23 your jail cell, welcome
[3:05:58] <%SilentRukei> Hey that's pretty good PogChamp
[3:06:00] <Huntercd> Should I be concerned that girl has a tiny skirt?
[3:06:02] <mr_slaide> @dero45 Pretty much.
[3:06:05] <DGZenos> LEWD
[3:06:13] <mr_slaide> We're alread ygoint to kail Huntercd.
[3:06:15] <Guntanks_in_Space> understandable
[3:06:15] <dero45> @maxxtreme23 Just take a seat right there
[3:06:15] <CalderGaming> you correct someone on sun wukong but mix up sengoku and three kingdoms Kappa
[3:06:20] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @Huntercd you should be concerned that you are concerened
[3:06:21] <mr_slaide> To jail.
[3:06:49] <alrobot2014> the question is whether we go before or after the outro for the stream
[3:07:02] <Guntanks_in_Space> it all depends on how fast the cops arrive
[3:07:07] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Do not PASS GO, do not collect $200
[3:07:41] <MaxXtreme23> are these sprites actually 3d models...?
[3:07:45] <Guntanks_in_Space> yes
[3:07:54] <%SilentRukei> yep
[3:07:56] <+PressXtoGout> thats pretty neat
[3:08:15] <hntronium> So I mixed up my porn, k
[3:08:26] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> I think the streamers are also 3D models and impressive looking ones too
[3:08:35] <Dlent_> I feel like he’s making it harder by not doing the jump attacks
[3:08:58] <CopperTucker> I need several adults
[3:09:06] <mr_slaide> You love it.
[3:09:10] <hntronium> You have them on the screen in front of you
[3:09:22] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @CopperTucker I'll "come" help Kappa
[3:09:26] <CopperTucker> you've got me there
[3:09:28] <hntronium> They're here to introduce you to the wonderful world of porn about china
[3:09:48] <mr_slaide> Fair warning: Do NOT play the visual novel game.
[3:09:53] <Guntanks_in_Space> ^
[3:09:55] <MaxXtreme23> oh a little bar on the bottom for otg, wall bounce and ground bounce
[3:09:58] <MaxXtreme23> that's neat
[3:10:00] <hntronium> No, play it
[3:10:05] <hntronium> But make sure to delete it
[3:10:08] <mr_slaide> Don't play it, nerds!
[3:10:09] <+Austinck> what about dangangronpa
[3:10:16] <Dlent_> I should point out that it’s common for these combos to only happen about once in every 2 out of 3 set at higher levels, if even that
[3:10:19] <hntronium> Danganronpa isn't porn enough to count
[3:10:26] <mr_slaide> Dugengrampa is tame compared to this shit.
[3:10:32] <+KR_Black> sumimasen but ... nani the fuck is this ?
[3:10:33] <hntronium> Actually, don't play the game. Play the remake.
[3:10:47] <MaxXtreme23> what about eiyuu senki
[3:10:55] <hntronium> Play that too
[3:10:55] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[3:11:41] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> slam these tiny girls with your fists
[3:11:43] <mr_slaide> What are you talking about? RoTK was all about fighting lolis.
[3:11:48] <hntronium> They skipped it in history because they are filled with shame
[3:12:04] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> shame?
[3:12:07] <%SilentRukei> @breakfast_megapowers Your jail cell awaits
[3:12:12] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> wats dat?
[3:12:14] <hntronium> Yes, shame
[3:12:16] <mr_slaide> DAMN

[3:12:18] <%Solidnick18> yooooooooo
[3:12:25] <hntronium> That thing you abandon when you play this game
[3:12:36] <%Solidnick18> that's horny
[3:12:37] <%SilentRukei> OH NO
[3:12:42] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> good thing I'll never play this game
[3:12:50] <+PressXtoGout> KappaHD
[3:12:54] <MaxXtreme23> why does it look like a teppen super
[3:12:55] <hntronium> You're right, you'll just play the VN
[3:13:02] <%Solidnick18> goddamn
[3:13:05] <hntronium> And then the FBI will kick your door down
[3:13:06] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> what's a VN
[3:13:12] <hntronium> Porn
[3:13:13] <MaxXtreme23> a bopk
[3:13:17] <goose_attack_almanac> Reggie's toes are WIGGLIN
[3:13:20] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> porn?
[3:13:23] <@Menitta> Visual novel
[3:13:24] <lilo52> smells like Liam Milk
[3:13:29] <katocrimson> cao cao is pleased with his legacy
[3:13:31] <hntronium> Yes, porn
[3:13:34] <%SilentRukei> Thanks, I hate it. WutFace WutFace
[3:13:36] <+KR_Black> octoPath octoEtic
[3:13:44] <mr_slaide> Didn't Cao Cao had like 30+ children?
[3:14:00] <+Austinck> more animes need pizza boys
[3:14:03] <%CaptainPileDriver> I GOT REGGIE'S CHARACTER
[3:14:18] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> aren't visual novels just hentai?
[3:14:24] <mr_slaide> Basically, yes.
[3:14:27] <hntronium> Yes, they're porn
[3:14:29] <%SilentRukei> I mean
[3:14:29] <mr_slaide> Depends which it is.
[3:14:30] <+knackirontarkus> not really
[3:14:35] <%SilentRukei> Not inherently
[3:14:35] <hntronium> Much like manga and anime.
[3:14:38] <mr_slaide> Depends on the series.
[3:14:38] <hntronium> Its all porn
[3:14:40] <fluke_LKZ> No, dummy.
[3:14:43] <@Menitta> No not really. There's a lot of VNs that are ALSO porn
[3:14:47] <fluke_LKZ> Phoenix Wright is a visual novel.
[3:14:50] <@Menitta> Ace Attorney is technically a VN
[3:14:51] <hntronium> Even that thing that's not porn. Its porn
[3:14:53] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> manga and anime are also porn
[3:15:02] <@Menitta> so is Steins Gate and Danganronpa
[3:15:03] <+knackirontarkus> there’s a subgenre that is but a good amount of VNs aren’t
[3:15:07] <hntronium> What we're viewing this very moment is porn
[3:15:13] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> especially Oreimo
[3:15:15] <+Austinck> lets not forget doki doki
[3:15:20] <mr_slaide> Well... It's based on a porn'ish VN.
[3:15:20] <dero45> Porn is in the eye of the beholder
[3:15:36] <mr_slaide> DDLC was kinda tame.
[3:15:36] <Guntanks_in_Space> BONG
[3:15:43] <+PressXtoGout> looney toons SFX
[3:15:59] <hntronium> See that just now
[3:15:59] <MaxXtreme23> you know what though, i'm kind of pissed that this VN got a fighting game but the masterwork that is majikoi is left in the dust
[3:16:03] <hntronium> That was definitely porn
[3:16:35] <+Austinck> isn't fate a vn
[3:16:39] <MaxXtreme23> yes
[3:16:42] <hntronium> Yes, porn was a vn
[3:16:54] <MaxXtreme23> fate is mollusc porn, everyone knows this
[3:17:00] <sage2001> what the fuck game is this?
[3:17:04] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> at least trash shows like Trigun and Cowboy Bebop will never get real video games
[3:17:14] <mr_slaide> Gender bender RoTK fighter.
[3:17:23] <hntronium> As you all know, porn never gets video games until it does
[3:17:24] <zamzoph> FEET
[3:17:28] <Kung_Fu_KaiTV> LUL
[3:17:28] <%SilentRukei> ＹＥＥＳＨ
[3:17:30] <@Menitta> LUL

[3:17:33] <Guntanks_in_Space> oh god
[3:17:35] <+Austinck> wasn't there a bunch of canned cowboy beobop games
[3:17:36] <hntronium> Reggie showing off his foot fetish
[3:17:37] <MaxXtreme23> reggie getting excited
[3:17:43] <@SoushinSen> Reggie can't escape the foot.
[3:17:45] <ManOfReason> reggie's sole burns
[3:17:50] <mr_slaide> Somewhere, Clemps is spanking it.
[3:17:53] <alrobot2014> we need to pan the camera down to reggie's toes
[3:17:54] <+Austinck> Reggie is motivated by the feet
[3:18:02] <%CaptainPileDriver> FEET
[3:18:02] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:18:04] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Reggie is a man of Soles
[3:18:06] <%CaptainPileDriver> FUCKING FEET
[3:18:11] <sage2001> the lamest game i've ever seen lol
[3:18:11] <%CaptainPileDriver> GG
[3:18:15] <zamzoph> that character has a feet-based scene, doesn't she?
[3:18:22] <alrobot2014> yup
[3:18:24] <hntronium> Probably
[3:18:25] <Guntanks_in_Space> Reggie is sustained by Sole Food
[3:18:30] <%Wool> HI IT'S ME AGAIN
[3:18:30] <hntronium> I don't know yet
[3:18:34] <%Wool> I DON'T KNOW HOW TO PLAY THIS EITHER
[3:18:39] <hntronium> Hi Wool, you getting in here too

[3:18:43] <%SilentRukei> Thanks, I hate it! SwiftRage
[3:18:47] <hntronium> Oh damn Wool getting into the porn too
[3:18:50] <+Austinck> I hope reggie got a high score on wiki feet
[3:18:59] <+TruSanKyuu> Wool better win on my account SwiftRage
[3:19:07] <%Wool> shoutouts to the Austin FGC for loaning me their PSN accounts
[3:19:09] <hntronium> Do it for chat wool
[3:19:24] <hntronium> Strike down reggie with feet
[3:19:26] <mr_slaide> Do it, nerd.
[3:19:35] <@Menitta> It'll be really embarrassing if Wool loses on not his account
[3:19:36] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Reggie is known to only enjoy 1/3 of Tic-tac-toe
[3:19:46] <sage2001> oh i thought the game bugged out and repeated the same line lol
[3:20:05] <MaxXtreme23> what the fuck this music sounds like it's from ddr
[3:20:26] <hntronium> At least its not eurobeat
[3:20:40] <@Menitta> I wish it was eurobeat
[3:20:41] <Dlent_> The music in this game is from the same composer who does the YS games, iirc
[3:20:43] <mr_slaide> Reggie eats chocolate bars with a knife and fork.
[3:20:47] <%SilentRukei> Almost sounds vaguely Kirby esque
[3:20:58] <hntronium> I don't know which side to root for. Which one is chat
[3:21:20] <MaxXtreme23> i root for the timer so it can end this match
[3:21:23] <hntronium> Is it the pervert or the pervert
[3:21:25] <mr_slaide> Woolie is green one.
[3:21:26] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> I root for Jail to cleanse us of our sins
[3:21:31] <BrikkSteele> Oh hey, I just read an article saying to play this to learn fighting games
[3:21:39] <%SilentRukei> @breakfast_megapowers Amen
[3:22:18] <%CaptainPileDriver> hey, if you don't get to many people joining can i get a match against reggie?
[3:22:31] <MaxXtreme23> that depends, are you going to hit him with your feet?

[3:23:37] <hntronium> Don't worry wool
[3:23:43] <hntronium> You'll have your revenge next time
[3:23:44] <@Menitta> The streak is over
[3:23:46] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> I worship the church of Jail-sus
[3:23:50] <%CaptainPileDriver> i'm sorry reggie's fetish had to be put on display by a little girl
[3:24:02] <+TruSanKyuu> Rip Wool
[3:24:20] <hntronium> Don't be sorry cap, Reggie loved it
[3:24:24] <Guntanks_in_Space> defeet
[3:24:31] <+Austinck> the best thing to do is to turn yourself in
[3:24:48] <%CaptainPileDriver> like, i really want to fight reggie but i don't want to take the room from someone else
[3:24:51] <mr_slaide> Lolis?
[3:24:51] <%KingLlama1> KingLlama1 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months, currently on a 7 month streak! Sup Woolz and team ... looking forward to that Bayo content, Platinum Games be best Games

[3:25:03] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[3:25:09] <hntronium> If we all turn ourselves in they can't arrest all of us at once
[3:25:27] <MaxXtreme23> did reggie mention why he's playing what appears to be one of the youngest looking characters
[3:25:32] <Kalinflip> what is this creepy animu bullshict ncssNapsThink
[3:25:35] <hntronium> He likes em young
[3:25:36] <@Menitta> Are you saying we should storm prison because they cant stop all of us?
[3:25:44] <hntronium> Not if we Naruto run
[3:25:45] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus soo, like, straight up, i want another match against reggie to give him a taste of daFEET
[3:25:48] <+Anonymasque> hiding from the sun
[3:25:55] <@Menitta> If we Naruto run we can outrun their bullets
[3:25:58] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> After the Lobby is OVA's
[3:25:59] <MaxXtreme23> the bathroom tournaments will live forever
[3:26:38] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> But Rob is a Zombie, what can he do?
[3:26:39] <hntronium> Woof
[3:26:41] <+PressXtoGout> Didn't they use the Kirby song for like 5 years on YT?
[3:26:42] <CalderGaming> use that thing that paige sang that one time
[3:26:46] <zamzoph> Just dress as Professor K again and you can play Dragula
[3:26:51] <hntronium> That was absolute wreckage just now
[3:27:02] <%CaptainPileDriver> DP motion is a command grab
[3:27:02] <+Redpointshine> METH GATOES
[3:27:03] <alrobot2014> METHGATORS?
[3:27:04] <%CaptainPileDriver> do it reggie

[3:27:20] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> but Platinum loses its luster sometimes
[3:27:24] <TigerClaws12> LUL
[3:27:34] <%CaptainPileDriver> DP motion is command grab

[3:28:16] <ECRead> that was Tennessee. Alabama had the meth squirrel named Deez Nuts
[3:28:19] <mr_slaide> For the love of god, do not play the visual novel.
[3:28:25] <%CaptainPileDriver> can i play again?
[3:28:27] <hntronium> You can't stop me
[3:28:31] <Huntercd> An apex predator on meth, what could go wrong?
[3:28:32] <mr_slaide> True.
[3:28:33] <%CaptainPileDriver> lol, there's only 2 lobbies
[3:28:36] <mr_slaide> Do it, nerd.
[3:28:36] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Can we play the Virtual Novel
[3:28:39] <hntronium> Only the police can stop me
[3:28:50] <hntronium> And they haven't caught on to me yet
[3:28:52] <@Menitta> Ladies and gentlemen...we got em
[3:28:58] <MaxXtreme23> if you hate that eyepatch, don't look at drakengard 3
[3:29:19] <%CaptainPileDriver> reggie she's only like, 15 you perv
[3:29:23] <%SilentRukei> A man of taste as always Reggie
[3:29:24] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> what does Drakengard have to do with a eyepatch
[3:29:29] <Nick_Degica> I've never played the VN, but I'll admit I've seen the CG from it from when we were getting ready for release and I was trying to figure out the IP.
[3:29:30] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Kappa
[3:29:40] <jasperkf> hurrah for sarashi
[3:29:57] <ECRead> love me some Daidouji
[3:30:21] <katocrimson> becos eyepatch is canon--xiahou dun

[3:30:55] <MaxXtreme23> i feel disgust
[3:31:04] <MaxXtreme23> excuse me as i go find refuge in fate grand order
[3:31:05] <mr_slaide> Kakotun, that is.
[3:31:07] <%SilentRukei> Just imagine
[3:31:08] <hntronium> In case anyone wants to know, the VN this is based on is called Koihime†Musō
[3:31:31] <%SilentRukei> In an alternate timeline this game would be getting into EVI this year instead of UNIST
[3:31:32] <mr_slaide> That's correct, hntronium.
[3:31:36] <%SilentRukei> *EVI
[3:31:39] <%CaptainPileDriver> i love how the one time it's easy to get in the lobby is for this no people playing game
[3:31:43] <%SilentRukei> *EVO
[3:31:44] <Dlent_> Evi indeed
[3:31:44] <mr_slaide> They even made an anime, but it was far more tame than the VN.
[3:31:56] <%SilentRukei> Fug
[3:32:05] <%CaptainPileDriver> OKAY

[3:32:53] <hntronium> The VN was released in english by mangagamer
[3:33:00] <hntronium> Oof, the art is kinda bad
[3:33:06] <hntronium> But it has a remake
[3:33:13] <mr_slaide> Correct.
[3:33:31] <%SilentRukei> Hmmmmm
[3:33:31] <+TruSanKyuu> Unkown

[3:35:18] <%CaptainPileDriver> kk
[3:35:18] <chronoxgp> first time i've seen it
[3:35:20] <%BestTeaMaker> @WoolieVersus so the devs of this game made the previous iteration of this series, called Shin Koihime Musou
[3:35:25] <mr_slaide> I am actually surprised many people have this game.
[3:35:28] <%SilentRukei> @captainpiledriver Next paycheck my dude lmao
[3:35:29] <Dlent_> I think this game is honestly more popular on Steam
[3:35:30] <%jinking79> i'm not risking my ps4 today
[3:35:33] <%BestTeaMaker> and the previous game before that is the eroge that this fighting game is based on
[3:35:33] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> as someone who doesn't own this game I want to play
[3:35:35] <$Rezca> I own it on PC
[3:35:38] <+Smileyhat> Is there much of an online community for this game? I've thought about getting it but not much point if there's no one to play with.
[3:35:38] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's 20
[3:35:39] <TigerClaws12> OH fuck someone was actually jailed for lolicons LUL
[3:35:43] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's 20 usa

[3:35:55] <mr_slaide> 20 usa which = 300 Canadian
[3:35:55] <%BestTeaMaker> i'm sure there is a discord for this game out there
[3:36:03] <%CaptainPileDriver> fuck it i guess
[3:36:04] <Nick_Degica> There is a discord for it.
[3:36:05] <%BestTeaMaker> but yeah, this game is literally based on porn

[3:38:29] <%SilentRukei> CAPTAIN STOP
[3:39:26] <%ozzrabbit> Why does it feel like characters with Chinese dresses are made for the sole purpose of showing off panty shots every time they kick?
[3:39:26] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:39:43] <%CaptainPileDriver> PFFFFT
[3:39:47] <%DeepSeaMastodon> !uptime
[3:39:48] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 44 minutes
[3:39:49] <coracor> Jebaited

[3:40:54] <mr_slaide> I am actually amaze at the amount of games this series has.
[3:41:00] <Nick_Degica> You only jump when you have a plan. Then again, don't do ANYTHING in Koihime Enbu unless you have a plan.
[3:41:01] <%CaptainPileDriver> PFFFTT
[3:41:10] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> We get paid?
[3:41:13] <%CaptainPileDriver> I GET PAID more for taking out the trash at my work
[3:41:15] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's done
[3:41:17] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> I thought we were FREE
[3:41:19] <alrobot2014> reggie's too expensive
[3:41:23] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus signup is over
[3:41:23] <%Solidnick18> someone gets paid
[3:41:29] <TigerClaws12> yea signing's over

[3:41:45] <%CaptainPileDriver> yes
[3:41:52] <%SilentRukei> It's over
[3:41:53] <TigerClaws12> It's closed
[3:41:54] <%CaptainPileDriver> the numbers are posted
[3:41:55] <$Rezca> I thought it was over, someone tweeted the numbers
[3:41:56] <%ozzrabbit> @BestTeaMaker i kinda meant in general. It's also like that with girls in skirts, but the short Chinese dresses just seem more obvious.
[3:43:33] <%CaptainPileDriver> hey reggie, check your twitter
[3:43:40] <MaxXtreme23> basic combo
[3:43:44] <%SilentRukei> Ah another Reggie character

[3:43:58] <%NeroInfinite> feet
[3:44:00] <%Solidnick18> lol
[3:44:02] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's not a stream unless there's feet pics
[3:44:17] <Guntanks_in_Space> huh, this is the first time i'm seeing sun quan played here lol
[3:44:17] <@Solidus_113> Are they anime feet or real feet?

[3:44:28] <%CaptainPileDriver> feeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet
[3:44:32] <$JobbedBone> Megumin lost her hat?
[3:44:35] <hntronium> Reggie you are already brainwashed
[3:44:38] <Guntanks_in_Space> or some shit
[3:44:40] <%SilentRukei> ｐａｔａｓ
[3:44:40] <hntronium> You just don't know it yet
[3:44:50] <%NeroInfinite> Reggie is hungry for toes
[3:45:07] <%CaptainPileDriver> if woolie hadn't outed you and you're weak denial that you don't like feet, this wouldn't be happening
[3:45:11] <Guntanks_in_Space> Kannei rather lol, also dem patas
[3:45:32] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> You know I was fine with Reggie being a foot fetishist but him making these foot jokes is NOT ok
[3:46:06] <Nick_Degica> Kakoen is my favorite character to play but she isn't very high tier list wise.
[3:46:14] <jasperkf> Bacho? Is that the Japanese name for Ma Chao
[3:46:16] <@Solidus_113> woolieMIRIN
[3:46:20] <%SilentRukei> !uptime

[3:46:51] <%SilentRukei> oh no
[3:46:51] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[3:46:59] <+chrishnaw> Showing your gazongas also displays trust
[3:47:03] <MaxXtreme23> oh geez that's xiahou yuan
[3:47:07] <CalderGaming> @WoolieVersus it's like Woolie and Darlington kind of
[3:47:08] <TheOddestDuck> fun
[3:47:27] <mr_slaide> Woolie, back then, people had familiar names and common names. It was disrespectful to use the familiar name if you weren't close to the person.
[3:47:28] <%galaxyswirl> @WoolieVersus its like fate and their titles, like how saber is king author
[3:47:46] <MaxXtreme23> king author, writer of many amazing books
[3:47:58] <jasperkf> Is best girl Guan Yu in this?
[3:48:05] <%galaxyswirl> okay fuck my mind auto corrected
[3:48:12] <%Solidnick18> Kreygasm
[3:48:13] <mr_slaide> As an example, Sun Ce's familiar name was Bo Fu.
[3:48:18] <mr_slaide> Guan Yu is in this.
[3:48:19] <+TruSanKyuu> Kreygasm
[3:48:20] <$Rezca> she bounces and sways

[3:49:04] <MaxXtreme23> all these girls are based on rotk figures
[3:49:06] <zamzoph> So... is eyepatch Xiahou Dun
[3:49:10] <mr_slaide> They have not used her yet. At least not for the last hour or so.
[3:49:11] <+chrishnaw> Zettai Ryouiki: The Video Game
[3:49:18] <$Rezca> I think the only one missing is Liu Bei himself
[3:49:20] <MaxXtreme23> right now it's xiahou dun vs. zhao yun
[3:49:32] <mr_slaide> Yeah, Liu Bei is not there.
[3:49:40] <%Solidnick18> caocao
[3:49:48] <mr_slaide> She's there.
[3:49:55] <mr_slaide> She's the one with the scythe.

[3:50:23] <jasperkf> Zhao Yun, is that the guy who Kongming trolled to death?
[3:50:34] <mr_slaide> Nah. You're thinking of Zhou Yu.
[3:50:38] <jasperkf> oh right
[3:50:46] <jasperkf> Zhao Yun Zilong
[3:50:48] <mr_slaide> And, historically, it never happened. ;)
[3:50:52] <MaxXtreme23> zhao yun is lthe big important guy from shu
[3:50:56] <%Solidnick18> sick
[3:51:00] <zamzoph> Surprise Punch Girl!
[3:51:06] <WarlockCoffee> squat queen
[3:51:16] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's easy to style on cardboard
[3:51:17] <MaxXtreme23> do you think this tiny girl also ate her own eye
[3:51:22] <%SilentRukei> I was expecting worse
[3:51:32] <mr_slaide> Nah. Also, historically, that did not happen too. :p
[3:51:44] <zamzoph> history is lame
[3:51:48] <MaxXtreme23> it's true
[3:51:49] <mr_slaide> I agree.
[3:51:53] <MaxXtreme23> lu bu was kind of a bitch in history
[3:51:54] <%SilentRukei> That was quite tame compared to extreme close up of feet
[3:52:00] <%CaptainPileDriver> night
[3:52:05] <%CaptainPileDriver> reggie, your dm's are cursed
[3:52:08] <%Solidnick18> goodnight

[3:52:22] <zamzoph> @WoolieVersus Does it make you want to check out the source material? Kappa
[3:52:26] <mr_slaide> Guan Yu was also an arrogant jerk.
[3:52:38] <%SilentRukei> So what's for next week?
[3:52:42] <%Solidnick18> sima yi FeelsGoodMan
[3:52:42] <MaxXtreme23> liu bei was also not as benevolent as we'd think
[3:52:44] <%CaptainPileDriver> can't wait to see the youtube upload

[3:53:12] <Hakuto1> cirCop what content?
[3:53:13] <mr_slaide> Yeah, Liu Bei was also kind of a jerk. BUT, he was also very downplayed historically. Many of his military achievements were attributed incorrectly to Kong Ming.
[3:53:18] <hntronium> I'll buy the VN too
[3:53:29] <%CaptainPileDriver> 0
