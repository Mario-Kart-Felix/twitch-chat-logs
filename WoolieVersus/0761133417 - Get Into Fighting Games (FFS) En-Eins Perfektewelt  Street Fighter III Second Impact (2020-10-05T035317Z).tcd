[0:29:49] <+Kashkabald> Hey, admin of the Akatsuki Blitzkampf discord here. What Mibeador forgot to mention was the fact that Akatsuki's mission was to actually destroy the Blitz Motor and Murakumo wanted it for himself.
[0:29:54] <kaidensizh> wiki guy*
[0:29:55] <+jiggy_snipe> Major Damage !!
[0:30:00] <alephalpha> no blood?
[0:30:04] <+Kashkabald> Akatsuki in the games isn't really affiliated to anyone, he just wants to kill off Murakumo and Adler. The only character that you could straight up call a Nazi is Adler given that he's obsessed with all the occultist stuff. Murakumo just kinds of wants to kill everyone and is also a clone of Akatsuki himself.
[0:30:22] <kaidensizh> Blood was removed in Ausf. Achse, since it needed to be censored for arcade environments.

[0:30:42] <%ChoculaUltra> wait, Murakumo is a clone?!
[0:30:42] <tearfuldevil> boooo
[0:30:43] <+elementl_> @Thunder_Child__ that's red hp you can get back during burst
[0:30:43] <SomersaultJustice> Minister of Lore
[0:30:51] <+Thunder_Child__> ooh makes sense
[0:30:51] <+Kashkabald> Yes, Murakumo is a clone
[0:31:05] <+jiggy_snipe> oh ok so there is only one Nazi, got it
[0:31:22] <+Kashkabald> yeah Adler is obviously a giant POS
[0:31:26] <Braystar> Technically 2 if you count the Soldats since they are clones of Adler
[0:31:28] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> damn I'm a bit late....also YO MINH!
[0:31:30] <tearfuldevil> they're still from imperial japan or ex-nazi so Kappa
[0:31:32] <%heyitsbrian> heyitsbrian subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! subbin
[0:31:33] <%ChoculaUltra> yo that's a sick palette for Fritz
[0:31:46] <+Kashkabald> yeah but the Soldats are just brainless - except the one you actually play as
[0:31:54] <alephalpha> why does reggeis refuse to spend meter?
[0:31:58] <kaidensizh> yo those extra hits on Fritz level 3 weren't there before PogChamp
[0:32:03] <+jiggy_snipe> mind goblins Kappa
[0:32:05] <+Deko_> SICK
[0:32:08] <alephalpha> oh really
[0:32:10] <tearfuldevil> you get a damage boost from it in this game
[0:32:13] <alephalpha> damn
[0:32:14] <tearfuldevil> its a tactical decision
[0:32:15] <+jiggy_snipe> idk maybe LUL
[0:32:17] <tearfuldevil> Kappa
[0:32:19] <+dmtjinni> snap judgment
[0:32:50] <+Kashkabald> Also by the way Sai is a vampire and is actually French pretending to be Chinese and working for the Triads
[0:32:51] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:33:03] <kaidensizh> I didn't know only Sai did that in EE lol
[0:33:06] <tearfuldevil> @Kashkabald fuck off LUL
[0:33:09] <Braystar> And Sai works for MI6
[0:33:09] <kaidensizh> in vanilla, it's a thing everyone can do
[0:33:09] <%ChoculaUltra> that's a p sick backstory off of that alone LUL
[0:33:11] <tearfuldevil> i hate anime
[0:33:15] <+Kashkabald> It's 100% true
[0:33:18] <+jiggy_snipe> oh cool I thought he was Yakuza lol
[0:33:18] <MichaelOfCainhurst> wat
[0:33:19] <+Kashkabald> Sai is actually french
[0:33:20] <+dmtjinni> FOR FUN? FOR GLORY???
[0:33:26] <+elementl_> have they found the double jump yet
[0:33:26] <Braystar> He also isn't a vampire, his eyes just drain life
[0:33:30] <%ChoculaUltra> so Sai is basically the French Revolver Ocelot, but a vampire.
[0:33:34] <+Kashkabald> He's also like 100 years old
[0:33:39] <%ChoculaUltra> LUL it gets better!
[0:33:48] <+dmtjinni> MINH LUL
[0:33:53] <huskarl_zap> min not feeling 4 20
[0:33:56] <Braystar> You guys really should read the stories in the wiki
[0:33:58] <%ChoculaUltra> ah, so that explains the shades
[0:34:05] <+jiggy_snipe> play as the tank
[0:34:07] <tearfuldevil> look at that jojo ass stance
[0:34:17] <astrophizz> oh ok
[0:34:18] <%ChoculaUltra> yo that BOUNCE tho
[0:34:21] <Zeif00> bobs
[0:34:25] <+jiggy_snipe> Kappa
[0:34:35] <townzzzzz> yooooo
[0:34:35] <alephalpha> woah
[0:34:35] <tearfuldevil> JIGGLE
[0:34:40] <+jiggy_snipe> ok what
[0:34:43] <%OathkeeperKH> OathkeeperKH subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months!
[0:34:46] <+Kashkabald> The real villians in the story are Mycale and Perfecti since they're the ones pulling the strings behind everything - and Anonym (nun with guns) is pretty much the only one who kinda knows this
[0:34:49] <%Solidnick18> woolieGASM
[0:34:55] <kaidensizh> Yeah, thanks to Ressen on Discord we finally have the story fully translated on the wiki, for both Vanilla and En Eins. You guys should check it out!
[0:34:57] <%ChoculaUltra> did he just reppuken
[0:35:02] <+elementl_> yes
[0:35:11] <+dmtjinni> tiddies
[0:35:12] <+elementl_> he has a double reppuken too I think
[0:35:15] <+Kashkabald> Yeah, please check it out. Was a fantastic collaborative effort
[0:35:16] <+Kashkabald> He does
[0:35:36] <+Kashkabald> En-eins is ez to play and really really good
[0:35:37] <alephalpha> ...
[0:35:42] <alephalpha> poor marilyn
[0:35:49] <kaidensizh> RIP Marilyn 2008
[0:35:54] <+dmtjinni> she kinda thicc
[0:35:56] <%ChoculaUltra> getting Rock Howard vibes and I'm all for it.
[0:35:57] <alephalpha> cmon she has to have somehting
[0:36:01] <alephalpha> like what's her gameplan
[0:36:02] <lem______> do yall think someone on the staff liked k'?
[0:36:11] <alephalpha> maybe justa little
[0:36:12] <+elementl_> en eins is definitely pretty close to rock howard
[0:36:16] <%ChoculaUltra> a teleport?!
[0:36:20] <kaidensizh> Marilyn used to be the pressure character in vanilla, but she was actually pretty busted
[0:36:24] <kaidensizh> so in AA she was heavily gutted
[0:36:26] <Braystar> Twink Rock Howard with an Iori flair
[0:36:32] <huskarl_zap> En eins is just Is One?
[0:36:33] <alephalpha> so en eins seems kidna great
[0:36:40] <alephalpha> why is he so good
[0:36:41] <Braystar> En-Eins is also clone jesus
[0:36:48] <alephalpha> oh that explains htat
[0:36:55] <alephalpha> but why is he wite if he's jesus?
[0:37:11] <Braystar> I don't know lol
[0:37:19] <huskarl_zap> Temple Rider?
[0:37:20] <astrophizz> gun katas?
[0:37:21] <RaidenRising> G U N
[0:37:23] <bleugh> gunnun
[0:37:24] <%ChoculaUltra> Temple Knight?
[0:37:25] <+Kashkabald> Temple Knight
[0:37:31] <huskarl_zap> ahh
[0:37:40] <huskarl_zap> Half Bruttier
[0:37:47] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> f
[0:37:48] <%ChoculaUltra> Gunkata nun?!
[0:37:50] <+Kashkabald> so yes the Templars are kinda in this mess too (sort of)
[0:37:56] <alephalpha> wow a character witha lot of air stuff being bottom 3 that's super suprising
[0:38:02] <tearfuldevil> OF COURSE THEY ARE
[0:38:08] <+jiggy_snipe> well that makes sense
[0:38:08] <Dave_VD> This game looks tight
[0:38:11] <Braystar> Anonym Guard is not the original Anonym, the original got body-jacked by Mycale to make Perfecti, and Kati is Mycale without the evil witch in her
[0:38:15] <townzzzzz> noice
[0:38:16] <Lucasleonava> ass
[0:38:17] <alephalpha> hwo does a character witha bunch of air stuff not have mixups
[0:38:18] <huskarl_zap> Which chapter?
[0:38:19] <%ChoculaUltra> yo this series has every thing, I'm sold
[0:38:19] <+dmtjinni> go minh
[0:38:46] <Braystar> Kanae is just a normal solider, nothing special but she has thick thighs
[0:38:46] <lazerscraper> theres witches?
[0:38:49] <Braystar> Yes
[0:38:50] <tearfuldevil> does the Guard in Anonyms name eman she's a variation?
[0:38:52] <alrightmanchild> we got him boys
[0:38:53] <%Solidnick18> oh right the gun lady
[0:38:57] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @kaidensizh
[0:39:00] <%Solidnick18> i remember her
[0:39:01] <kaidensizh> oops
[0:39:02] <tearfuldevil> or is it just her name
[0:39:02] <+Kashkabald> the witches are the real villians pretty much
[0:39:04] <%ChoculaUltra> wait a damn minute, jump cancel all of her air moves? That's kinda sick.
[0:39:04] <Braystar> Anonym Guard is Anonym's superior
[0:39:15] <Dave_VD> This gun nun is too rad
[0:39:17] <%Invlux> Kappa
[0:39:25] <%Solidnick18> hmmm
[0:39:25] <+jiggy_snipe> Kappa
[0:39:29] <alrightmanchild> En-Ein is femboy jesus
[0:39:33] <Zeif00> SeemsGood
[0:39:40] <Braystar> The gun nun got gutted, no more projectile normals, just command normals
[0:39:47] <%ChoculaUltra> SNK Boss like input reading levels of Rugal 94?
[0:39:52] <%Solidnick18> oooh
[0:39:52] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1305742410211876864?s=19
[0:39:54] <@Menitta> Ah makes sense
[0:39:54] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> sounds reasonable
[0:39:56] <alephalpha> oh
[0:39:57] <%Solidnick18> well that's alright
[0:39:58] <huskarl_zap> Deluge of blood
[0:40:00] <Zeif00> me too
[0:40:00] <+Kashkabald> Yes, the final boss is bullshit
[0:40:06] <Guachaut> Understanable
[0:40:07] <%ChoculaUltra> that's awesome
[0:40:09] <+Kashkabald> But you can cheese her with Sai
[0:40:11] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> SOUNDS REASONABLE
[0:40:17] <lazerscraper> is she as bad as The General?
[0:40:20] <%jinking79> Valkyrie
[0:40:21] <+Kashkabald> No
[0:40:31] <+Kashkabald> She's BS but not that much
[0:40:32] <Braystar> Lol no
[0:40:36] <+Kashkabald> Sai just murders her
[0:40:43] <Braystar> No one is as bad as the General
[0:40:45] <+Kashkabald> Valk cannot deal with the fish curse
[0:40:46] <alrightmanchild> honestly Valkyrie is not that bad
[0:41:01] <kaidensizh> did Mib already mention airdashes?
[0:41:06] <+elementl_> valkyria A tier at best
[0:41:11] <alrightmanchild> just run away like a little bitch and parry everything
[0:41:30] <RaidenRising> YES THE DUMB TANK
[0:41:33] <%Solidnick18> yeah that's what nazis wore
[0:41:39] <%Solidnick18> lol
[0:41:39] <townzzzzz> perfecti is cute
[0:41:48] <huskarl_zap> There are better Nazi Valkiery titties.
[0:41:48] <RaidenRising> GUN LANCE
[0:41:48] <Daemonsho> does woolie think everything euroepon = nazi?
[0:41:51] <Braystar> Perfecti wants to genocide humanity
[0:41:57] <huskarl_zap> Sylvaria
[0:42:01] <Braystar> Also AK-47 spear
[0:42:04] <nintega010> Assault Rifle Lance. GODLIKE
[0:42:16] <Braystar> It shoots Blitztank lazers
[0:42:18] <%Invlux> I'm losing my mind over the idea of a Nazi Idol live concert
[0:42:20] <cainthep1caro> They're just feathers, dude
[0:42:27] <%Solidnick18> yoooo
[0:42:31] <%Solidnick18> she has a chair
[0:42:33] <alephalpha> yooo
[0:42:35] <alephalpha> chair
[0:42:36] <Braystar> Oh, speaking of Tank, it uses dying soldiers as living batteries
[0:42:42] <alrightmanchild> bro wtf
[0:42:43] <alephalpha> oh cmon
[0:42:46] <alrightmanchild> chair
[0:42:47] <Guachaut> Chair is top tier?
[0:42:49] <anarchistPastry> what is that getup animation
[0:42:50] <tearfuldevil> yeyeye suplex
[0:42:51] <+elementl_> perfecti is based
[0:42:53] <+elementl_> best chair
[0:42:55] <alephalpha> really dying soldier batteries
[0:43:04] <Braystar> And his super beam is meant to be a last ditch attack that uses up all the life energy
[0:43:10] <+Kashkabald> yeah the Tank is just kind of a living abomination
[0:43:11] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @huskarl_zap
[0:43:21] <alephalpha> wild
[0:43:31] <alephalpha> so I'm assuming the soldier are force dinto it?
[0:43:42] <+elementl_> well they're dying
[0:43:48] <alephalpha> ahh
[0:43:51] <alephalpha> so they cponsent?
[0:44:07] <+dmtjinni> 420
[0:44:15] <%ChoculaUltra> this is kinda making me want to rewatch Hellsing Ultimate
[0:44:15] <huskarl_zap> 420
[0:44:16] <alrightmanchild> Katis straight vibing ngl
[0:44:20] <Braystar> Yeah it's actually sad, if you read Tank's ABK story it gets worse when the tank gains all the memories of all the soldiers it once held (Might not be the case but it sounds cooler)
[0:44:39] <Braystar> No they don't consent at all
[0:44:42] <alrightmanchild> Tank story is pretty ad
[0:44:43] <Braystar> It's painful
[0:44:49] <+Deko_> her wake up animation looks crazy
[0:44:50] <%ChoculaUltra> thats rough FeelsBadMan
[0:45:04] <alrightmanchild> feel bad for funny tank
[0:45:06] <huskarl_zap> Can V come on right now and explain Blitzkreig bop to us non punk asses?
[0:45:08] <tearfuldevil> yeyeye cip kills
[0:45:08] <alephalpha> ahh that actually soudns cool
[0:45:18] <alephalpha> I guess tankw as the real hero we were looking for
[0:45:20] <Leafboi125> Monod Duncan
[0:45:23] <alephalpha> tnak didn't ask for any of this
[0:45:25] <Leafboi125> Major
[0:45:32] <kaidensizh> in case Mib didn't mention it, Kati is actually the little girl Mycale possessed in Vanilla
[0:45:37] <Braystar> In EE En-Eins controls a Tank to fight the big bad
[0:45:54] <kaidensizh> in EE she's purified and you get to play as her
[0:46:27] <blackkanye> Why couldn't we get Perfecti in tag BibleThump
[0:46:40] <%ChoculaUltra> so uh, what does the game's name actually translate into? My German is really bad.
[0:46:41] <Braystar> Kati is also a german girl raised in shang-hai (Could be wrong, I forget the specifics) and her parents know Sai
[0:46:53] <+Andrizzleton> was expecting nazi fighting gmae....not far off
[0:46:53] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:46:53] <Braystar> En-Eins Perfect World
[0:46:55] <RaidenRising> THE TANK
[0:47:00] <%ChoculaUltra> ah cool cool
[0:47:01] <Braystar> It's quite obvious
[0:47:03] <+lordreginald> let's just go dumb and put en-eins in bbtag, yuzu style dirty assist crossups
[0:47:07] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> The tank you cowards
[0:47:11] <anarchistPastry> show me Dawei
[0:47:12] <huskarl_zap> daway
[0:47:17] <+Kashkabald> Dawei literally means "Big Wei" btw
[0:47:22] <%ChoculaUltra> yooo Dawei's hair is amazing
[0:47:24] <%Solidnick18> show him dawei
[0:47:41] <+Kashkabald> Marilyn Dajie means "Big Sis Marilyn" while we're at it
[0:47:46] <huskarl_zap> NUT PUNCHES PogChamp
[0:47:55] <spacecatstreams> right whats this then
[0:48:07] <Braystar> Adler also calls himself 'Super Adler' in EE after dying and reviving in a Soldat
[0:48:15] <alephalpha> so what's the deal with daewie sai and amrilyn they are using chinese martial arts
[0:48:24] <+Kashkabald> yes
[0:48:31] <kaidensizh> I don't play any adler I play s u p e r adler
[0:48:35] <+Kashkabald> they're all working for different branches of the Triads
[0:48:36] <%ChoculaUltra> are there any wacky secret characters like a Shin Adler or Violent En-Eins?
[0:48:44] <Braystar> No
[0:48:46] <+elementl_> adler lvl 3 is tengu stone lmao
[0:48:46] <kaidensizh> not actually
[0:48:46] <+Estuko> ? Does he not have a weapon?
[0:48:50] <brunoberserk> is this emulator ?
[0:48:52] <kaidensizh> but there *are* unused characters
[0:48:57] <+Estuko> I could've sworn Adler had the "Texas Hammer"
[0:49:04] <kaidensizh> such as a robot akatsuki
[0:49:06] <%ChoculaUltra> oooo unused characters like in the game files and what not?
[0:49:08] <Braystar> There is an unused character we dub 'Robo-Akatsuki', details are in the wiki
[0:49:09] <+elementl_> not technically an emulator
[0:49:10] <anarchistPastry> idk if its emulator or just kusoge
[0:49:10] <alephalpha> so is en ein the new main character?
[0:49:15] <%ChoculaUltra> oh Robo Akatsuki sounds rad as hell
[0:49:16] <+Kashkabald> this isn't technically emulated - this is an arcade rip of a game that ran in basically a PC
[0:49:16] <Braystar> It's emulated
[0:49:39] <+Kashkabald> it's running natively on any PC via hacks
[0:49:42] <kaidensizh> he has wavedashes and mishima stuff
[0:49:43] <Braystar> En-Eins is the new main character yes
[0:49:49] <%ChoculaUltra> the mid hitsparks are on Dawei's dick tho...
[0:50:51] <+jiggy_snipe> tank time
[0:50:52] <RaidenRising> YES
[0:50:56] <Braystar> Wei wants to kill Murakumo because Murakumo killed his boss who was a clone of Murakuro
[0:51:03] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> woolieYE
[0:51:03] <townzzzzz> LUL
[0:51:04] <alephalpha> sadly he doesn't have unblockable setups like bbtag
[0:51:07] <Braystar> Murakumo has a lot of clones
[0:51:11] <+Thunder_Child__> a tank with no armor
[0:51:13] <tearfuldevil> yeyeye bottom 1
[0:51:22] <+Zeplin666> the car from street fighter 2 is having its revenge
[0:51:23] <alephalpha> they shoudl give tank unblockable setups like bbtag
[0:51:27] <flowdere> its the tank from cross tag he is tank icon
[0:51:28] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> It's Big Zam
[0:51:29] <%FuqBoiSlim> BLITZTANK LETS GOOOOO
[0:51:34] <@Menitta> I love the hit sound effects in this game
[0:51:39] <+elementl_> blitztank is a cyberbots character
[0:51:39] <Braystar> Guys it's funny tank laugh
[0:51:46] <%jinking79> how does a armor Tank not have armor
[0:51:47] <@Menitta> Everything's got a nice piercing crunch
[0:51:49] <alrightmanchild> blitztank is actually pretty short
[0:52:00] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> do like kenshiro
[0:52:08] <SjoeB89> So is this CrossTag Battle?
[0:52:20] <tearfuldevil> ...
[0:52:22] <tearfuldevil> yes
[0:52:27] <tearfuldevil> this is crosstag battle
[0:52:29] <SjoeB89> LOL
[0:52:30] <tearfuldevil> definitly
[0:52:44] <fangovafang> *Tank Noises*
[0:52:45] <Braystar> Just say the characters look sick as fuck
[0:52:45] <%ChoculaUltra> I'm not gonna say they're sick, but I'm not gonna say they're not sick LUL
[0:52:52] <Braystar> Because they are
[0:53:00] <alephalpha> the lif eof a soldier
[0:53:06] <blackkanye> The characters are cool lookin
[0:53:08] <Braystar> Even Adler, he's so evil it's hilarious
[0:53:18] <+Kashkabald> It's frame 4 and even that was a nerf
[0:53:21] <tearfuldevil> BIG JOHNS
[0:53:23] <+elementl_> elemen58Mura2
[0:53:25] <%ChoculaUltra> Adler is hilariously evil.
[0:53:27] <tearfuldevil> DIDN'T COUNT
[0:53:37] <+elementl_> the funny walk
[0:53:39] <RaidenRising> JILL ?
[0:54:07] <@Menitta> could get a college degree before wakeup
[0:54:07] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:54:13] <Braystar> MuraRun emote on the ABK discord
[0:54:19] <TigerClaws12> LUL
[0:54:29] <+elementl_> if twitch had gif emotes I'd upload it to my channel lol
[0:54:45] <@Menitta> I wish Twitch without BTTV had gif emotes
[0:55:07] <gregisonline> this game is like all the Axis countries got together and made a game
[0:55:08] <%ChoculaUltra> yeah, Twitch's native gif game is sorely lacking.
[0:55:17] <F_Wily> wait how do you have this game?
[0:55:23] <tearfuldevil> where's italy then
[0:55:23] <+Kyanta_Rojo> Jconfig
[0:55:35] <alephalpha> they have chian but not italy
[0:55:44] <Braystar> We have all the ABK games on the discord
[0:55:49] <%ChoculaUltra> this is the same company that thought subscriber only streams were a better use of their time so kinda not holding my breath for gifs LUL
[0:55:50] <gregisonline> there's yellow pasta on the side of the screen
[0:55:51] <+Kyanta_Rojo> @F_Wily it works with some emulator called Jconfig. You can find a link for it in the ABK discord
[0:55:53] <gregisonline> obv
[0:56:08] <SjoeB89> JFC
[0:56:08] <+Kashkabald> EE was leaked on the internet several years ago part of a bigger leak of Taito Type X2 games
[0:56:12] <TigerClaws12> LUL
[0:56:24] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> EVO CHAMPION
[0:56:28] <+deviljhojho_> damn what is this title
[0:56:34] <+Kashkabald> Same leak that gave you Persona 4 Ultimax 2.0
[0:56:39] <F_Wily> @kyanta_rojo send me a whisper please.
[0:56:41] <gregisonline> lmao gun spear
[0:56:47] <%ChoculaUltra> now that was a leak.
[0:57:13] <+Kashkabald> Of course this game got overshadowed because P4U 2.0 was there
[0:57:36] <gregisonline> when did this come out it seems so old but new
[0:57:42] <+elementl_> 2010\
[0:57:42] <+Kashkabald> It's funny because now that there is parsec and people can play 2.0 online, feels like a lot of the western community just didn't like 2.0
[0:57:57] <TigerClaws12> 4:3 game in 2010 tho? LUL
[0:57:59] <+Dova573> imo that guys sword super is kinda lame compared to other sword suoers
[0:58:06] <lem______> was described to me as kusoge but in the bad way
[0:58:09] <@Menitta> man I hope they do another GIFG of P4A
[0:58:21] <kaidensizh> kusoge are so kuso they actually underflow and become good
[0:58:23] <satans_finest_millennial> 7.62 x 39 Halberd
[0:58:25] <huskarl_zap> Pole arm gun is rad
[0:58:27] <gregisonline> PogChamp
[0:58:28] <kaidensizh> that's the philosophy to poverty games
[0:58:46] <huskarl_zap> is fritz Asian?
[0:58:46] <+Kashkabald> A lot of people (me included!) gave this game shit when it came out for being different, but it's actually a good game
[0:58:47] <+Kyanta_Rojo> @F_Wily did you get it?
[0:58:54] <+elementl_> mib PogChamp
[0:59:00] <+Kashkabald> Let's go mib
[0:59:03] <tearfuldevil> whose top tier
[0:59:17] <kaidensizh> Fritz was a japanese military surgeon at the war
[0:59:24] <+Kashkabald> En-Eins, Sai, Adler
[0:59:29] <huskarl_zap> if Fritz is a Germaboo then why doesnt he use a straight sword?
[0:59:35] <%ChoculaUltra> Surgeon wielding a katana? Sold.
[0:59:52] <+Kashkabald> and Kati
[0:59:53] <Braystar> The only bad thing about EE is the aesthetic tbh, not as unique as ABK's
[1:00:00] <tearfuldevil> yeah
[1:00:06] <kaidensizh> he knows basically everyone from that time, as the old geezer
[1:00:08] <tearfuldevil> the rainbows are wierd
[1:00:16] <kaidensizh> Akatsuki, Adler, Murakumo
[1:00:21] <tearfuldevil> why are there so many rainbow hitsparks and sfx and shit
[1:00:36] <+Kashkabald> let's just say when this game was announced and all you got was blurry ass 240p footage it looked like absolute dogshit
[1:01:04] <+Kashkabald> it's grown on me over time especially when you can actually have good quality footage
[1:01:04] <kokujin_> i love the UI design of ABK
[1:01:10] <kokujin_> EE kinda lost that
[1:01:11] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[1:01:28] <kaidensizh> I'm still not a fan of EE's visuals, but Mib's love for it is contagious and I could get into it any day
[1:01:33] <+Kashkabald> oh yeah AA has great UI design
[1:01:42] <+Kashkabald> hard to top that

[1:11:20] <TeepPhoenix> We could play Higurashi Touhou again.
[1:11:28] <+Kashkabald> that is obscure
[1:11:28] <kaidensizh> Akatsuki Threetskampf
[1:11:35] <+Kyanta_Rojo> I love that Woolie finds the obscure games. I used to play all the terrible Doujin Games back in the day looking for those hidden gems
[1:11:43] <%jetjagger222> wtf is that rifle
[1:11:44] <CyberEne> yeah!
[1:11:46] <@Menitta> man my stream is not cooperating

[1:11:55] <huskarl_zap> awesome is what it is
[1:11:56] <RamenRiderZ> Working the shit out is part of the fun
[1:11:59] <TeepPhoenix> That looks like a heavily modified AK
[1:12:08] <%chll0ne> im too scared to play doujin fighters
[1:12:11] <+donpatrondx> it's a feature, not a bug
[1:12:16] <%jetjagger222> or the offspring of a partizan and an stg-44
[1:12:21] <%chll0ne> this is why i stick to rare jrpgs like megami tensei

[1:14:44] <TigerClaws12> so what's perfecti's lore, chat?
[1:14:53] <tearfuldevil> CHESUTO
[1:14:55] <huskarl_zap> woolieKICKDAD poyo
[1:14:59] <%Invlux> why is the sound she makes when she gets damaged just her laughing
[1:15:04] <alephalpha> KNEW NOTHING
[1:15:06] <TeepPhoenix> She has a chair.
[1:15:10] <TeepPhoenix> That's all I know
[1:15:11] <Braystar> Because everything is a joke to her
[1:15:11] <kaidensizh> Another fun mention: timeline dictates that Akatsuki's combat design in Under Night is majorily based in En Eins, instead of Blitzkampf.
[1:15:16] <%jetjagger222> was that a noose
[1:15:16] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:15:19] <+Kashkabald> Perfecti is the actual villiain pulling the strings from the shadows
[1:15:25] <+Luke_Sky_Larker> she is like darkness
[1:15:29] <+Kashkabald> And a 1000-year old witch
[1:15:31] <flowdere> why is a gun on a staff?
[1:15:37] <TigerClaws12> of course

[1:16:01] <+Dova573> I swear one of the characters looks like shinsuke nakamura
[1:16:09] <TeepPhoenix> This guy is like Weeaboo Kotal Khan
[1:16:10] <Braystar> Also: Akatsuki's super in UNI where he slams the ground? It's a souped up version of his burst super
[1:16:18] <%Invlux> @Vorga1339 Japanese fighting game naming conventions are getting really complicated Kappa
[1:16:31] <+Kashkabald> also fun fact Valkyrie/Tempelritter appears in ABK/AA as Mycale's parry
[1:16:47] <+Luke_Sky_Larker> are those feathers on her head? cultural appreciation

[1:19:13] <Braystar> To be fair we've been dealing with the nazi shit for YEARS
[1:19:15] <+gambit_gamble> This game is rife with nazis!!
[1:19:16] <+gambit_gamble> lol
[1:19:17] <TeepPhoenix> Robocop 2 addressed this issue.
[1:19:18] <@Menitta> Yeah but TECHNICALLY this game doesnt have nazis
[1:19:23] <+donpatrondx> oops all nazis
[1:19:23] <+Kashkabald> Yeah it's Melty Blood Bathroom Joke tier
[1:19:24] <Braystar> People still call ABK 'Jewpuncher'
[1:19:29] <tearfuldevil> LUL
[1:19:30] <+Taglog7> It's a visual aesthetic OKAY
[1:19:32] <%jetjagger222> is this varg vikernes' fighting game of choice
[1:19:33] <TigerClaws12> just Nazi adjacents LUL
[1:19:40] <+gambit_gamble> yeah but the tank is a nazi tank
[1:19:49] <%Invlux> I wonder what another word for exterminating a population is Kappa
[1:19:52] <%jetjagger222> so pillar men
[1:20:00] <TeepPhoenix> This lore is rotting my brain.
[1:20:06] <+Taglog7> so Fraggle rock
[1:20:06] <+Luke_Sky_Larker> Wolfenstien: am I a joke to you
[1:20:09] <kaidensizh> Fun fact: Under Night In-Birth concept art is the actual only glimpse of what a Blitz Engine looks like we ever had, as of CLR's gallery mode.
[1:20:09] <TeepPhoenix> And my brain is already pretty rotten
[1:20:18] <huskarl_zap> So Eldar
[1:20:25] <tearfuldevil> @Luke_Sky_Larker wolfenstein is about KILLING nazis though
[1:20:29] <%Joe2187> "Generic evil group of people whp dress in leather and red arm bands"
[1:20:33] <TurtleButter> is the word taboo to you?
[1:20:34] <+gambit_gamble> Melty blood be looking very strange
[1:20:41] <TeepPhoenix> The Thule Society?
[1:20:52] <%jetjagger222> ahnenerbe or something like that
[1:20:52] <kaidensizh> It's like a special suit, with special probes connecting gloves and shoes to an implant engine in the operator's chest.
[1:20:55] <tearfuldevil> yeah the watchamacallit society
[1:20:55] <+Kashkabald> honestly the only one thats 100% just a nazi is really Adler
[1:20:55] <+Estuko> @Joe2187 red ribbon army
[1:21:06] <%jetjagger222> it was on the history channel a lot
[1:21:07] <huskarl_zap> Addler the chicken farmer
[1:21:20] <tearfuldevil> the Thule Society, that was it
[1:21:23] <%Joe2187> Is this Sonic the hedgehog human OC?
[1:21:32] <+Estuko> Adler The Nazi Hammer
[1:21:49] <+gambit_gamble> wohohoho
[1:21:53] <%Invlux> Reggie just gnomed us
[1:21:58] <+Kashkabald> Akatsuki just wants to get rid of Murakumo and Adler, the Soldats are drones, Murakumo wants to pretty much kill everything and become a god with the engine
[1:21:59] <+gambit_gamble> ^
[1:22:00] <huskarl_zap> GHOST DIVISION
[1:22:12] <Braystar> Akatsuki doesn't want to be a god

[1:22:36] <DDDorsett> DIO
[1:22:37] <%jetjagger222> NAKAMURA
[1:22:42] <kaidensizh> Technically there's a precursor game to Blitzkampf, called Akatsuki Shisei Ichigo. Sadly it's a little bit of a prototype and *really* hard to run on modern computers.
[1:22:46] <昭和60> Aatsuki = Captain America
[1:22:47] <huskarl_zap> The true path is closed to Gwilos

[1:25:10] <tearfuldevil> Keiretsu!
[1:25:13] <%jetjagger222> fritz sure looks japanese for a nazi
[1:25:15] <TeepPhoenix> Owain is the most Chuuni guy ever
[1:25:19] <tearfuldevil> Tenpa kyoran!
[1:25:20] <+Kashkabald> he is japanese
[1:25:21] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> though I think Owain is a t least aware of his chuuni
[1:25:26] <tearfuldevil> Look, the East is Burning Red!
[1:25:30] <neuronova> majinoElmo
[1:25:32] <%Joe2187> HEAT UP
[1:25:38] <Braystar> Also: multiple characters have the same VA
[1:25:55] <Braystar> Aka, Mura and Wei share the same VA
[1:25:56] <%jetjagger222> we like to shit on VN chuuni flavor, but apparently chinese internet light novels are way worse
[1:25:56] <tearfuldevil> you people talking about Owain being "the most chuuni guy ever" ahve clealy not consumed that much ln garbage lol
[1:26:02] <flowdere> is En-eins voiced by woman?
[1:26:06] <el_patronn64> En eins does look cool
[1:26:09] <huskarl_zap> Be unafraid
[1:26:18] <TeepPhoenix> In Garbage? Elaborate, please.

[1:26:48] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Owain is one example, but yes there definitely is a TON of stuff
[1:26:54] <%jetjagger222> yo that choppy move is cool
[1:27:06] <@Menitta> dethrone and kill god
[1:27:26] <Braystar> Kill the twink god clone with the sword bathed in blood
[1:27:27] <%jetjagger222> neat
[1:27:29] <TeepPhoenix> FATALITY!
[1:27:34] <huskarl_zap> PogChamp god dead
[1:27:44] <%Joe2187> Kati?
[1:27:48] <tearfuldevil> the thing about owain is that he actually lives in a world with magic and dark gods
[1:27:48] <%Invlux> oh hang on thanks @gambit_gamble for the gift sub woolieMIRIN
[1:28:00] <tearfuldevil> he might be more of an edgelord than the people around him
[1:28:10] <tearfuldevil> but like, there is actually a dark dragon god who ahs chosen oens
[1:28:17] <TeepPhoenix> Kanae looks a lot like Jill from MVC2
[1:28:17] <neuronova> ?
[1:28:17] <tearfuldevil> and he did time travel
[1:28:25] <s4lty__lad> wow no one went the tank
[1:28:29] <@Menitta> kanae is cool
[1:28:32] <%jetjagger222> kanae has some motoko kusanagi + jill valentine vibes
[1:28:34] <flowdere> Kati is why i quit anime
[1:28:39] <TigerClaws12> thighs AND jiggles PogChamp
[1:28:46] <+Underachiever_Mako> wait what why is Kari just Mycale
[1:29:00] <+Kashkabald> Kati is the girl that Mycale posessed
[1:29:07] <+Underachiever_Mako> ohhh ok
[1:29:16] <bastionsin> tank was already picked, you missed that
[1:29:17] <kaidensizh> Kanae has a command roll, you found out
[1:29:19] <kaidensizh> as 3C
[1:29:20] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:29:27] <+Underachiever_Mako> is Mycale in this game too?
[1:29:32] <+Underachiever_Mako> or no
[1:29:33] <flowdere> her staff doesnt have hurtbox?
[1:29:35] <kaidensizh> nope
[1:29:38] <+Kashkabald> In EE she is free from the posession since Mycale just decided to bodyjack Anonym
[1:29:41] <kaidensizh> only Kati and Perfecti
[1:29:42] <Braystar> No, Mycale is Perfecti
[1:29:45] <flowdere> even though it moves her along
[1:29:48] <+Kashkabald> To make Perfecti
[1:29:52] <%jetjagger222> whats happening when the background goes funky and the hitstop goes nuts
[1:29:55] <%AlteisenReiseZ> God I want Kanae to kill me
[1:29:59] <+Underachiever_Mako> F, there goes one of my ABK mains
[1:30:01] <%AlteisenReiseZ> I mean what
[1:30:12] <+Underachiever_Mako> at least I still have Wei
[1:30:19] <+Kashkabald> Fun fact: there's actually an unused version of Mycale in the data
[1:30:25] <kaidensizh> Marilyn mains: "Your first time?"
[1:30:33] <+Underachiever_Mako> Idk if I’d like Kati or not
[1:30:49] <+Kashkabald> There's also a character that we call "Robo Akatsuki" that has Mishima wavedashes and even an EWGF of sorts
[1:30:51] <TeepPhoenix> Boo-urns?!
[1:30:56] <+Kashkabald> Sadly unfinished
[1:30:59] <TeepPhoenix> ACHTUNG
[1:30:59] <kaidensizh> there's actually ABK Vanilla versions of three characters in the code
[1:30:59] <+Underachiever_Mako> they don’t have the summons I liked from mycake
[1:31:04] <kaidensizh> afaik it's Mycale, Tank and Anonym
[1:31:12] <+Underachiever_Mako> I’ve heard of them in the discord
[1:31:19] <kaidensizh> they play exactly as they did in Vanilla, and we believe they were used as development templates
[1:32:13] <neuronova> looool
[1:33:01] <TeepPhoenix> MASTER SPARK!
[1:33:42] <@akuda_bar> "I kinda wanna release it" sounds like... something
[1:34:05] <%jetjagger222> frustration is getting bigger
[1:34:38] <+Kashkabald> Theres an old ass AA vid with a Perfecti player doing the full TAP laser...
[1:34:40] <%Invlux> is the meter going SLOWER
[1:34:43] <+Kashkabald> ...and then it just gets parried
[1:34:53] <%Invlux> LUL

[1:35:04] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @huskarl_zap
[1:35:13] <TeepPhoenix> Diamond is not crash

[1:36:28] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1305742410211876864?s=19
[1:36:33] <TeepPhoenix> Where were they going without ever knowing da wei?
[1:36:37] <+Kashkabald> With Wei, regardless of the game, you always want the movement buff on
[1:36:50] <TeepPhoenix> IVY?!!?
[1:36:55] <%chll0ne> this sounds like some CC2 music
[1:37:07] <smartiger117> What’s good gang
[1:37:16] <%jetjagger222> s'all good
[1:37:19] <+Kashkabald> Also fun fact: the composer of most of the OST of this game is the same guy that did the music of The Outfoxies
[1:37:20] <huskarl_zap> @smartiger117 its 420 here
[1:37:36] <+elementl_> wait we know who the composer is?
[1:37:40] <TeepPhoenix> Are you in Australia?
[1:37:41] <+Kashkabald> Yes
[1:37:49] <TeepPhoenix> G'day
[1:37:54] <+Kashkabald> It's the same dude from The Outfoxies which is also a rad ass game
[1:38:01] <+Kashkabald> Woolie should do it
[1:38:05] <Braystar> I'm aussie as well
[1:38:14] <+Kashkabald> It's KIND OF a fighting game? It's Smash before Smash
[1:38:20] <TeepPhoenix> Aussie is Ausome
[1:38:23] <%jetjagger222> yeah its like the grandaddy of smash except with hitmen
[1:38:27] <+elementl_> I'll at least need to check out the ost
[1:38:35] <+Kashkabald> It's a great OST
[1:38:45] <%jetjagger222> didn't the guys play it on fisticuffs
[1:38:47] <TigerClaws12> -42? LUL
[1:38:57] <+Kashkabald> Yeah they might have, I have a vague recollection
[1:39:20] <+deviljhojho_> Winnar
[1:39:29] <%jetjagger222> yup it was a fisticuffs ep
[1:39:44] <%jetjagger222> eyy its double
[1:40:12] <+Kashkabald> I'm not sure if he also did the OST for the EE-exclusive tracks though but I would assume so
[1:40:17] <TeepPhoenix> She's more like Alexander Anderson from Hellsing?
[1:40:25] <%jetjagger222> or the nuns from black lagoon
[1:40:55] <okkinadar> gun nun
[1:41:01] <@Menitta> All I see with Anonym is "that gun nun who lost me so much money in Saltybet"
[1:41:07] <%Solidnick18> gun and nun
[1:41:13] <+elementl_> anonym is so bad lmao
[1:41:14] <+Kashkabald> Anonym shoots you while shouting AMEN, best character

[1:54:52] <huskarl_zap> Fritz for RWBY fighter?
[1:54:53] <kaidensizh> It's because reportedly, the consistent member of Subtle Style works at French Bread.

[2:00:02] <lazerscraper> ngl i think 2I has the better music and stages
[2:00:08] <%jetjagger222> agreed
[2:00:14] <BurdRightsActivist> You're totally right
[2:00:15] <+Kashkabald> sean needs to mash stand MP like a madman anytime he's fullscreen
[2:00:21] <BurdRightsActivist> But Beats in My Head, though
[2:00:23] <BurdRightsActivist> and Killing Moon
[2:00:24] <+Kashkabald> Ridiculous meter build
[2:00:24] <Mysidian_Maestro> Good Fighter is better than Kobu.
[2:00:33] <%jetjagger222> 2I hugo stage rocks
[2:00:36] <%Solidnick18> hugooo
[2:00:42] <+jiggy_snipe> Bottoms Up is better
[2:00:49] <%jetjagger222> YEYEYE
[2:00:57] <+marumariball> this song is so good
[2:00:58] <%Solidnick18> aye comeback poison
[2:01:37] <%Reverend_Roscoe> This animation is sooo clean
[2:01:48] <%Reverend_Roscoe> I feel like it reads better than 3D models, too
[2:02:05] <%jetjagger222> RIP hugo
[2:02:05] <+jiggy_snipe> Minh is here for 2I PogChamp
[2:02:30] <lazerscraper> dont get me wrong 3S has bangers i just think 2I characterizes it more for everyone
[2:02:31] <+jiggy_snipe> yes the artwork was fantastic
[2:02:32] <%jetjagger222> urien's portrait is hilarious though
[2:02:43] <%jetjagger222> it looks like a roach just flew on his face
[2:03:08] <TungstenViper> 2nd Impact is better than 3rd Strike
[2:03:10] <neuronova> what game this?
[2:03:13] <LibriJamm> I think that 2I has better melodies but 3S has better percussion work and bass.
[2:03:13] <%Solidnick18> corkscrewww blooow
[2:03:20] <+Dova573> Nah 3s is da best
[2:03:28] <+jiggy_snipe> Street Fighter 3: 2nd Impact
[2:03:30] <anarchistPastry> what is THAT
[2:03:35] <+Dova573> Just for the fact Alex has a ddt in 3s
[2:03:40] <UltimateDomon> They dropped it in 3S and brought it back in 4
[2:03:43] <UltimateDomon> I wonder why
[2:03:44] <%jetjagger222> release wukong from the rock
[2:03:46] <SomersaultJustice> love how hang says raishin mahaken
[2:04:07] <fangovafang> SingsNote SingsNote SingsNote SingsNote
[2:04:12] <Mysidian_Maestro> I do think Urien's 3S theme is better than his 2I one though.
[2:04:20] <+Dova573> I think because it shares the input with back swing blow
[2:04:24] <+jiggy_snipe> I agree
[2:04:42] <TungstenViper> nah fam Nile theme is better than Crazy Chili Dog
[2:04:44] <+jiggy_snipe> but Gill's stage is the best in 2I
[2:04:49] <%jetjagger222> bit of a toss up with the BGMs, but stages are way better in 2I
[2:05:52] <TigerClaws12> LUL

[2:08:34] <@Menitta> I miss how crunchy fighting games sounded
[2:08:37] <+jiggy_snipe> snap the condom on Kappa
[2:08:41] <TigerClaws12> REGGIE
[2:08:47] <TimetodiveLTX> i wonder if 3s would be as popular with this theming
[2:08:54] <%Solidnick18> gutter trash
[2:08:59] <%jetjagger222> dudley's throw is still one of the most painful looking things in SF
[2:09:06] <@Menitta> I dont think the soundtrack would be
[2:09:13] <UltimateDomon> I think all the voices got better in 3S
[2:09:15] <huskarl_zap> this is the GBA version isn't it?
[2:09:21] <@Menitta> all of this sounds wrong lmao
[2:09:43] <%jetjagger222> yeah 3S sounds have been engraved into the FGC's collective memory

[2:14:50] <@Commando_Joe> or was that only New Generation?
[2:14:54] <+jiggy_snipe> 2nd Impact
[2:15:03] <@Commando_Joe> Yeah okay
[2:15:07] <%jetjagger222> 3S necro voice is way better
[2:15:08] <+Kashkabald> 2I has Top Tier Sean
[2:15:09] <TungstenViper> Necro = Blanka + Dhalsim
[2:15:09] <UltimateDomon> Necro sounds too normal in this one
[2:15:15] <TomCrimson> OUTTA MY WAY
[2:15:15] <@Menitta> I wish there was an Ultra Street Fighter 3
[2:15:21] <TimetodiveLTX> outta muy wuy
[2:15:22] <+Kashkabald> Incredibly busted meter gain, great normals
[2:15:23] <@Menitta> So we could have version select
[2:15:29] <+Kashkabald> Good damage
[2:15:44] <trickquestionz> What is this stage?
[2:15:51] <%jetjagger222> its a train full of mutants

[2:16:26] <+kingryan96> 2I Sean was too good
[2:16:47] <TomCrimson> this theme for ken is criminally underrated
[2:16:48] <%jetjagger222> did oro have the ball frames here already
[2:16:52] <TimetodiveLTX> is that his yacht
[2:16:55] <huskarl_zap> Orbo always edging it under his robe.
[2:16:56] <+Kashkabald> still not better than 3S Chun but hey
[2:17:03] <trickquestionz> Boat Master Ken(ny)
[2:17:12] <+jiggy_snipe> Funky Bay is my fav Ken theme sorry SF2
[2:17:33] <Hammatime8> Look at that stupid-ass boat. I love it!
[2:18:07] <huskarl_zap> Ken masters know Epstein since Epstein owns 99% of all yacht docks
[2:18:07] <Dave_VD> Is there a reason some people might prefer this over third strike?

[2:19:26] <+Kashkabald> My reason: 3S Chun is way more obnoxious than any of the top tiers in this game
[2:19:26] <UltimateDomon> This game has good music but I think 3S's instrumentation is better
[2:19:28] <@Menitta> "FUCK THIS" "but you won"

[2:22:12] <+Dova573> You sean was the og Miles Morales? Kappa
[2:22:18] <+Dova573> 'saying
[2:22:29] <TimetodiveLTX> this character was too crazy to stay good
[2:22:31] <+Kashkabald> Sean needs to mash the MP button so hard until it breaks to actually properly play the character
[2:22:33] <TimetodiveLTX> if that makes sense
[2:22:53] <trickquestionz> Ibuki got that Samurai Cop neckbreaking tech

[2:33:07] <+jiggy_snipe> yea

[2:33:18] <+jiggy_snipe> patientgamer
[2:33:19] <TimetodiveLTX> passive salt debuff
[2:33:21] <%jetjagger222> nice way to put it
[2:33:23] <Kei_Ar_> just wait untill the second wave with fixes
[2:33:31] <+ja07sj> what games are there to even play that you can *only* get on PS5?
[2:33:37] <TungstenViper> which game?
[2:33:45] <Mibeador> Demon's Souls
[2:33:46] <+jiggy_snipe> Demons's Souls I think
[2:33:50] <anarchistPastry> E.Honda gettin his back scrubbed lmao
[2:33:50] <TigerClaws12> yea demon souls ain't coming to PC LUL
[2:33:53] <badjab326> 2nd Impact had best stages and music free
[2:33:54] <Infeirno23> i only preorder for games i already played Kappa
[2:33:54] <TungstenViper> oh
[2:33:56] <Mysidian_Maestro> HK isn't it?
[2:34:02] <+VariantX7> also never get launch hardware. Let everyone else be the canary in the coal mines
[2:34:07] <Dementedpenguin> Yeah, I waited until 2015 to get a PS4. I learned my lesson from the past.
[2:34:08] <+ja07sj> Demon's Souls is on PS3 Kappa
[2:34:10] <diontmack> i might get a ps5 to play mostly the ps4 games i never got
[2:34:10] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1305742410211876864?s=19
[2:34:16] <TimetodiveLTX> i can't justify owning hardware i can't jailbreak
[2:34:20] <diontmack> i didnt get a ps4
[2:34:43] <starlessdan> Yo what would you guys recommend as a game to get into Streetfighter?
[2:34:48] <SomersaultJustice> LUL
[2:35:00] <TigerClaws12> LUL
[2:35:03] <Infeirno23> except reggie has a chance of actually killing on screen LUL
[2:35:06] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[2:35:35] <cynicalrose> I say play thrid strike I really enjoyed that game
[2:35:58] <UltimateDomon> This songs nice but its no Killing Moon
[2:36:29] <+ja07sj> 3s is harder, SFV is probably the easiest these days, despite the broken launch
[2:36:36] <TungstenViper> these intros are sick. Capcom gives 0 fucks now. they COULD do it. they just don't care enough
[2:36:45] <yusefHD> Yoshi victory pose in ssbu is SHOOOOSH
[2:36:55] <Mysidian_Maestro> SFV doesn't even have an intro right?
[2:37:02] <anarchistPastry> thats been Yoshis victory pose since 64 lmao
[2:37:11] <yusefHD> LUL
[2:37:14] <huskarl_zap> THE ROIDS
[2:37:14] <@Menitta> It has an intro but only on initial boot
[2:37:18] <+ja07sj> SFV has an intro cutscene now
[2:37:20] <@Menitta> so effectively no
[2:37:36] <Mysidian_Maestro> Is that the tutorial w/Ryu and Ken?
[2:37:40] <TungstenViper> @Mysidian_Maestro only personal intros which is lame. seems like a design phylosophy brought in by western games in SF4
[2:37:41] <SomersaultJustice> arcade edition's intro was great, so it's too bad it only plays once
[2:37:48] <+ja07sj> No there's a full CGI intro
[2:37:53] <+AsinPersuasion> how different is 2nd impact from 3rd strike?
[2:38:07] <anarchistPastry> they made an official 3S-esque sprite for Laura in a recent artbook actually
[2:38:07] <WillyFresh992> man this spritework always blows me away
[2:38:08] <@Menitta> No its the cg intro that has Ryu turning into Evil Ryu with Necali
[2:38:19] <huskarl_zap> whiff manslaughter
[2:38:20] <cynicalrose> Im off to play the greatest fighting game ever made, Over Watch Kappa
[2:38:23] <TungstenViper> wait, aren't we talking about character intros?
[2:38:34] <SomersaultJustice> I dunno lol
[2:38:37] <@Menitta> Oh yeah AE did have an intro
[2:38:40] <Mysidian_Maestro> Damn, for some reason I remember it going straight to menu.
[2:38:52] <@Menitta> LUL
[2:38:55] <+AsinPersuasion> LOW TIER HERO
[2:38:57] <Mysidian_Maestro> I only tried the SFVCE free trial for a day.
[2:39:09] <huskarl_zap> Mihn opens all his BAN KAIs
[2:39:11] <+AsinPersuasion> actually is sean low tier in 2nd impact?
[2:39:20] <+ja07sj> SFV has character intros as well, but they're not like MK10/11 where the characters have different things to say depending on who they're fighting
[2:39:23] <SomersaultJustice> sean's one of the best in 2I
[2:39:29] <+jiggy_snipe> Sean is the highest tier in 2i
[2:39:32] <TomCrimson> @AsinPersuasion have you not been watching them play sean? he's great in this one
[2:39:39] <+AsinPersuasion> no i just tuned in
[2:39:42] <SomersaultJustice> RAISHIN MAHAKEN
[2:39:55] <+VariantX7> i thought red parry was in 2i
[2:40:02] <TomCrimson> @AsinPersuasion He's DP is broken he's wild in 2nd
[2:40:10] <+AsinPersuasion> interesting
[2:40:22] <@Menitta> If you whiff his DP, does he still dunk
[2:40:31] <@Menitta> or is it a followup
[2:40:37] <+AsinPersuasion> were there any other big tier changes from 2I to 3S?
[2:40:39] <TomCrimson> he still does it
[2:41:11] <%Joe2187> how do i set up fightcade to open roms?
[2:41:11] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:41:15] <SomersaultJustice> 3S had red parry and more characters, some supers and specials were changed

[3:07:46] <%ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> Did Dudley not have a british accent in 2nd Impact? macawOmg
[3:07:54] <Mysidian_Maestro> @Kyanta_Rojo Best bet is to challenge him as soon as you see him out of a match I'd say. Fast as you can.
[3:08:00] <+jiggy_snipe> Woolie spreading false info?
[3:08:03] <+Kyanta_Rojo> I'll try that

[3:27:26] <+InvisiblessedReptile> It's an excelent game, shame I was never good at it
[3:27:37] <SomersaultJustice> believe in judgement
[3:27:42] <okkinadar> more yang leggooo
[3:27:55] <+jiggy_snipe> 1-1
[3:27:56] <Evendrag> ok, so i went digging. apparently, Ibuki did appear in new generation first, and for some reason on her wikia page, she has this really long creepy detailing of all her outfits in 4 for SOME reason NotLikeThis
[3:28:00] <bazz_tv> fun fact there is an unfinished Hugo hidden within this game
[3:28:37] <+jiggy_snipe> Ryu is always a bum
[3:28:38] <SomersaultJustice> there's a finished one too Kappa
[3:28:40] <huskarl_zap> dont hate
[3:29:09] <bazz_tv> oh wait I was thinking of new generation
[3:29:13] <destinyspider> I don't play Street Fighter, but this honestly looks really cool. Elena especially is super well animated.
[3:29:14] <yusefHD> SeemsGood SeemsGood SeemsGood
[3:29:53] <yusefHD> PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt
[3:29:54] <+jiggy_snipe> the sprite work in SF3 is very good. it's pretty and fluid
[3:30:14] <destinyspider> Most these guys aren't reocurring characters though it seems. In that SF5 Demo I only really saw Ibuki and Axel or whatever he's called
[3:30:22] <+Dova573> Maybe next time I can give Reggie the work too
[3:30:31] <bazz_tv> is sad that the cps3 didn't got more games
[3:30:40] <SomersaultJustice> so when's Red Earth
[3:30:47] <bazz_tv> it had a lot of potential
[3:30:54] <@SoushinSen> yeah sorry dova for being so free
[3:30:55] <%weapon000> @evendrag yeah I just looked it. That is weird.
[3:31:04] <Evendrag> question, who is out there writing down such detailed descriptions avout the outfits of sf characters, this is nuts...
[3:31:21] <Mysidian_Maestro> GGs lads!

[3:31:56] <Evendrag> wryyy
[3:32:16] <%weapon000> @evendrag Someone who thinks Ibuki is their waifu apparently.

[3:33:44] <destinyspider> Being good at something isn't all too essential at enjoyment
[3:33:46] <huskarl_zap> Does not have ggmans blessing suprising me
[3:33:51] <Mysidian_Maestro> Dong Dong needs JoyToKey though.
