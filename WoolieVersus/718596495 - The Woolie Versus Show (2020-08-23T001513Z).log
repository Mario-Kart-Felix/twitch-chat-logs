[0:01:35] <yesar94> doggo
[0:01:35] <whimsicallifestyle> paige also chose the furry option
[0:01:36] <+HaunchPaunch> ESPN spent a WEEK covering if Timthetatman got a win. Dude spent Hundreds of games before he finally won.
[0:01:37] <%Prevot> up that sick music woolz

[0:02:02] <%huskarl_zap> sports entertainment is dead
[0:02:05] <KeiArRein> woolie what furry race would you be
[0:02:11] <%RyTYoung> There's so many cool crossover skins, like Jacket from Hotline Miami, Bulletkin from Enter the Gungeon, Half life and Portal also!
[0:02:12] <+neutralraff> paige is suffering pat big LOL
[0:02:12] <DrkJP520> Game's been out for a month. You'll see plenty of costume variety online
[0:02:15] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Paige will never finish a round at this rate lol
[0:02:17] <@Solidus_113> BATTLE PASSSSS
[0:02:17] <%JetpackMcQuack> Pog
[0:02:18] <%relentingapunch> Battle pass
[0:02:18] <%SuperKirby24> inb4 woolie wins first try
[0:02:24] <LoneFonte> still no way to preview win scenes
[0:02:31] <%huskarl_zap> KILL ALL BIRD GANG
[0:02:31] <%JustYudha> Battle Pass is free btw
[0:02:34] <%huskarl_zap> They cheat
[0:02:37] <pennykettle_> make sure you check that store 🕶️
[0:02:41] <sunnythedrunk> You get 1 crown for winning also
[0:02:44] <cervidaequus> paige is "balls in my ass" level already
[0:02:46] <sunnythedrunk> crown is rare currenc
[0:02:47] <+HaunchPaunch> CROWNS are win bucks
[0:02:53] <%cobalt_phoenix_> this is gonna be fun
[0:02:57] <%chosenjuan42> PEACH ELIMINATED AGAIN
[0:02:59] <%sparkly_yoyo> I have a hunch we're gonna get No More Heroes 3 stuff
[0:03:00] <MassConnect> Pat was a jerk and karma forbade him from winning
[0:03:03] <@Solidus_113> PORTAL
[0:03:04] <%relentingapunch> P-Body
[0:03:06] <pennykettle_> I hate seeing the roadmap before the game launches, like that godfall thing
[0:03:06] <+neutralraff> she did it?
[0:03:08] <+SpoopySkeletman> Portal Skins Pog
[0:03:08] <TheSharkyStephen> Game is not free tho
[0:03:08] <pennykettle_> portal baybeeee
[0:03:09] <%Prevot> just bought P-Body earlier today
[0:03:09] <BalloniWright> Woolie will buy the Boxer Costume PogChamp
[0:03:09] <yesar94> pog
[0:03:12] <LoneFonte> nope
[0:03:13] <DrStinkers> other way
[0:03:14] <%RyTYoung> Crowns are gained from winning
[0:03:15] <+ChrisPlaysThing> As someone who was in the QA Trenches of charlevoix, i loathe the battle pass system. i was around for every game in production at the time trying to make their own at the time.
[0:03:17] <Jp_DrZaius> nop
[0:03:18] <%SuperKirby24> I vibe with that slushie costume tho
[0:03:19] <+Bwarch> Purple currency you get just by playing.
[0:03:25] <sunnythedrunk> Crowns are from winning yes
[0:03:26] <tattleworm> no premium currency, playing gets kudos, wins get crowns
[0:03:29] <Hammatime8> Kudos can be earned for free, but it's slow
[0:03:29] <pennykettle_> That achievement is awful
[0:03:30] <Virokwet> what
[0:03:31] <%Gamefriendly> the screen is cropped out?
[0:03:31] <%DesertPenguin> NO ONE
[0:03:33] <%SuperKirby24> yeah that's on steam too lol
[0:03:34] <%ECRead> nobody yet
[0:03:35] <+dmtjinni> PogChamp
[0:03:35] <+JustToWatch> 0.1%
[0:03:35] <Jp_DrZaius> cheaters
[0:03:35] <%DesertPenguin> That's fucking nuts
[0:03:35] <LoneFonte> crowns in winning a match, just playing
[0:03:35] <purekyun> can't even win 2 in a row for me
[0:03:36] <%eanscrale> Funnily enough the crowns are premium you can only bye basic cash
[0:03:37] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Just hack, easy
[0:03:38] <+MrStardustRicon> That seems so impossible
[0:03:38] <%sparkly_yoyo> It was supposed to be impossible
[0:03:38] <DelgotHansto> I GOT 4 AND FUCKED IT
[0:03:38] <%nxflre> it super rough but if you quit it doesnt ruin the streak
[0:03:39] <+hooppawesomeness> i got three, but then disconnected: (
[0:03:40] <DrkJP520> That's a fucking idiotic trophy
[0:03:41] <DrStinkers> global stats are like 0.0%
[0:03:42] <Djinnazz> there's ppl that have it
[0:03:43] <%mikessdd> Yeah that's fucking real and it's dumb
[0:03:44] <%sparkly_yoyo> Someone actually did
[0:03:44] <cerass> battle pass is fully free
[0:03:44] <+TylerRich117> 1%
[0:03:44] <%Prevot> even 2 in a row is crazy tough
[0:03:46] <DelgotHansto> TAIL TAG FML
[0:03:54] <+TheRisingPride> yeah, the screen is cropped around the edges
[0:03:55] <%nxflre> Season pass is FREEEEEEEEEE
[0:03:55] <%DesertPenguin> You'll see, it's not entirely in your hands
[0:03:57] <@Solidus_113> Fall Guy 5560
[0:03:59] <+glassesaregod> Both currencies are from just playing, but crowns you have to win the whole thing
[0:04:01] <Reisadan> Not since Mile High Club has there been a more worthy trophy.
[0:04:02] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> reggie don't even know

[1:00:03] <gbrincks> Spin the wheel, if it falls on Yellow, you're booted off the game
[1:00:03] <%RyTYoung> @saltyghostrock hoarders is god awful

[1:00:26] <rcand9> seesaw reggie dont choke
[1:00:28] <%doomerskeletor13> I believe in Reggie
[1:00:29] <Spydurman> Paige back on controls
[1:00:30] <NiktenKing> @lonefonte Apparently not
[1:00:30] <+zzNamttamzz> targeting the weakest team is the way to win team games
[1:00:32] <+patriotrenegade> someone get me the clip for when Pat ragequit i missed it

[1:00:37] <+SaltyGhostRock> @RyTYoung I lost at hoarders once beacuse our ball went too high
[1:00:39] <R3Roundabout> Paige is in control for round 1 seesaw, OH GOD
[1:00:40] <Partyvansama> so i'm here
[1:00:40] <Onatamana> All the Yellow ream memes seem to be having a genuine impact in-game

[1:00:44] <VritraReiRei> Fall Guys Salt Intro incoming?
[1:00:45] <0rond> nah only bottom team loses fits the game's aesthetic and feeling better. it's meant to be wacky and assholey
[1:00:49] <rcand9> paige vs reggie?
[1:00:50] <@Solidus_113> THAT'S A LIE

[1:01:05] <el_biribon> dive tech is real
[1:01:06] <aarariio> I find that diving is awful in this stage
[1:01:06] <sunnythedrunk> You have to time the dive

[1:01:11] <TigerClaws12> lobosKek
[1:01:12] <%Farples> woolieONEGUY
[1:01:13] <%doomerskeletor13> So that was a lie
[1:01:19] <sparked963> the longer u fall the more u stumble and slide off
[1:01:21] <TheNix> diving is definitely real, but hitting people can still cause you to ragdoll
[1:01:21] <%ekodrop> reggie's just bad
[1:01:23] <Robert_Eccles> The idea behind it is that the dive usually triggers the get up animation
[1:01:25] <TigerClaws12> chat, dive tech is real
[1:01:27] <sparked963> dive shortens it
[1:01:31] <sunnythedrunk> You have to dive right before you hit the ground

[1:28:04] <eddi401> Paige LUL
[1:28:04] <+Jp3g95> The phrase “it’s just a game” is such a weak mindset. You are ok with what happened, losing, imperfection of a craft. When you stop getting angry after losing, you’ve lost twice.
[1:28:07] <DelgotHansto> The phrase it's just a game is....
[1:28:09] <%huskarl_zap> Woolrilla mindset

[1:32:02] <$serpenttucker> Considering how many kudos you get, you really should not be spending money on this game beyond buying it once
[1:32:07] <KasiCrafter> Physics! The farther from the pivot you are on a lever/seesaw, the less force you need to get the seesaw to tilt. However, if you're directly on a pivot, it takes a HUGE amount of force to even make it budge.
[1:32:12] <CazadorDeWulf> Put your balls on the line
[1:32:15] <TigerClaws12> her game's bugging out

[1:54:15] <sunnythedrunk> It's not over
[1:54:26] <tattleworm> can you even play that game if you don't have ps+
[1:54:30] <SirKeigan> Most
[1:54:35] <+Jp3g95> PS Plus August: FREE, otherwise, you pay $20
[1:54:35] <sunnythedrunk> Yes you can
[1:54:37] <gbrincks> Why on earth
[1:54:38] <Fleet_Admiral_Sakazuki> i agree with reggie
[1:54:40] <Shardlab> Some games aren't worth keeping
[1:54:41] <SirKeigan> Some aren't interesting, you get what you want
[1:54:41] <+Kage_96> I aint getting monster's motorocross minh
[1:54:43] <VidulaSaix> Agreed Reggie
[1:54:45] <Fleet_Admiral_Sakazuki> some games you just realyl dont care about
[1:54:46] <+Exicuren> Just have them
[1:54:47] <rcand9> yep
[1:54:49] <CazadorDeWulf> Woolie has high confidence that these games will be available in the future
[1:54:50] <SirKeigan> Basically
[1:54:50] <sunnythedrunk> Even if you cancel Ps Plus later you can play the game
[1:54:54] <Shardlab> I take quite a few, but some I just don't care about
[1:54:55] <+merten0083> ehhhh fair enuff
[1:54:58] <SirKeigan> Minh, welcome to 6 years ago
[1:54:59] <Rangenade> this does not need to be a discussion omg haahah LUL LUL
[1:55:02] <Robert_Eccles> I'm not gonna take trash, even if it's free
[1:55:03] <sunnythedrunk> Minh is right
[1:55:04] <%JustYudha> Free shit is not good...
[1:55:04] <gbrincks> SHIT'S FREE. WHY
[1:55:06] <Shardlab> Or I own the game already
[1:55:06] <%eyezehuhh> Reggie is correct
[1:55:06] <%Struggleful> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug It took me like 6 tries to make that jump on the tubes. I forget what trips me up m.
[1:55:07] <$Superdandy96> Should probably get that whiles it’s free
[1:55:07] <SirKeigan> Why is this a discussion?
[1:55:11] <eldragon_1> Minh is right
[1:55:14] <Retinolgaming> Know yourself enough to know what you will play.
[1:55:15] <+heyitsdenzel_> its free real estate
[1:55:16] <+Exicuren> I'm going to have them, you never know
[1:55:16] <+jiggy_snipe> it's ok I claim everything on the Epic Store
[1:55:17] <%DappercatEsquire> just got here, are they done?
[1:55:19] <shinji_ifrit> Minh is mega right
[1:55:21] <yesar94> i agree with mihn
[1:55:21] <SirKeigan> This is like every dumb troll topic on GFAQs about PS+ free games
[1:55:24] <+KingOfTheGeats> just grab the free game
[1:55:25] <sunnythedrunk> Minh is insanely right it takes like 5 seconds
[1:55:33] <Djinnazz> not rteally
[1:55:33] <rcand9> true
[1:55:53] <%sparkly_yoyo> Having games I don't play gives me anxiety
[1:55:54] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @struggleful just aim for the center of the tube. maybe overshoot it a little. the beginning of dizzying heights has the same tube if that helps
[1:55:55] <KaiserMario> Nah, if I know I'm never playing it, I won't grab it...
[1:55:55] <SirKeigan> For business yea get it all just to try but as a normal person then you don't waste harddrive space on shit you don't want
[1:55:56] <%jinking79> Might. 9 was free on PS+ no one cared
[1:55:56] <%JustYudha> 5 seconds to get a free game you will NEVER PLAY
[1:56:06] <CrypticMochi> I mean, I don’t sample every stall in Costco if I’m not interested.
[1:56:08] <heckengine> fall guys slaps but its not gonna be like a lol or whatever for competative games, its just fun. good for streaming good for playing
[1:56:08] <SirKeigan> It doesn't take 5 seconds to download the games though
[1:56:11] <+Jp3g95> Why get a game you're not gonna play
[1:56:13] <rcand9> i dont like clutter
[1:56:14] <SirKeigan> Why is this a topic?
[1:56:15] <sunnythedrunk> You don't even have to download it
[1:56:21] <sunnythedrunk> you can download it at any time
[1:56:25] <Casinoroyale80> elitist woolie
[1:56:33] <rcand9> library clutter is super annoying
[1:56:34] <%JustYudha> "here take my left used dirty sock...because it's free"
[1:56:35] <+Exicuren> Why not get a game that pretty much you payed for it?
[1:56:40] <+jiggy_snipe> it's just the claim process which is quick
[1:56:41] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> HUNIEPOP
[1:56:42] <VidulaSaix> I HATE THAT LUL
[1:56:45] <$Superdandy96> Gotta say folks, didn’t expect to get in some deep dives. Wouldn’t be a Woolie stream otherwise though
[1:56:46] <SirKeigan> Because people care what's in your profile? LUL
[1:56:47] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> "accidentally"

[1:56:57] <VidulaSaix> Was it Murdered Soul Suspect? Kappa
[1:57:11] <%DappercatEsquire> way i see it, with free games might not be interesting to me immediately, but they may be in the future
[1:57:13] <sunnythedrunk> People are playing devil's advocate and its fine if you don't, but there's no reason not to
[1:57:14] <%Chatterbox1991> Boofet?
[1:57:14] <%huskarl_zap> Dump into your purse
[1:57:17] <%huskarl_zap> and pockets
[1:57:19] <rcand9> is minh doing a poll?
[1:57:29] <SirKeigan> Boofay
[1:57:34] <yesar94> @Chatterbox1991 LUL
[1:57:37] <+Exicuren> I mean, those PS+ games are really not free, you payed for them
[1:57:45] <SirKeigan> No
[1:57:48] <SirKeigan> You paid for the PS+ service

[1:58:05] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @exicuren "its free money" -Patrick Boivin
[1:58:11] <DatAsuna> 2 weeks is plenty
[1:58:13] <+jiggy_snipe> give him 2 days

[1:58:21] <+LCGOV> that's a lot of time
[1:58:21] <VidulaSaix> LUL
[1:58:25] <SirKeigan> Woolie doesn't agree with you so you don't wanna talk to him about it anymore? Really?
[1:58:25] <$Superdandy96> To the point: get on them deals if there’s any good ones
[1:58:25] <+LCGOV> I'd take that bet no problem
[1:58:26] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[1:58:27] <+jiggy_snipe> give him 10ngames or something
[1:58:28] <boogz____> Lmao give him 5 houra

[1:58:34] <rcand9> reggies going for top 8
[1:58:38] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> 2 weeks is way too long. 2 days is reasonable
[1:59:02] <KnivesEve> i won twice in a row on my 3rd day. i never won again since then
[1:59:03] <heckengine> 50 games lol
[1:59:04] <+jiggy_snipe> yall should make the bet

[1:59:53] <+Exicuren> It makes sense with tetris BR because it's skill
[1:59:57] <eddi401> 50 would be for fortnite

[2:00:30] <RyuShinden> Minh Maxing it up

[2:00:33] <%Struggleful> Somebody has to win, why not Minh?
[2:00:33] <+ttvp> I feel that's an unhealthy way to look at it, but that's just me
[2:00:34] <RAH001> a dub is a dub
[2:00:35] <%illtima> We're witnessing Minh's villain origin story
[2:00:40] <+Exicuren> but fall guys is more knowing the course and learning the feel of the game, the rest is random
[2:00:40] <brunoberserk> Woolie : I am not a winner , you all are GARBAGE
[2:00:49] <Bloodhit> I can't believe there people that bought "free" games with PS+ bullshit from sony. They are not free, their cost is the cost of PS+ that they included with.
[2:00:49] <shujojo> I'm 2 hours late, did i miss the game or are they just taking a break?
[2:00:54] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @superdandy96 tried to play fall guys drunk once and the memory game fucked me up every time LUL
[2:00:56] <RyuShinden> This ios where the Minh Max philosophy comes from TPFufun
[2:01:02] <%huskarl_zap> mohn makes a book. " How to not be a loser, I earned that win."
[2:01:03] <SirKeigan> Minh is like Floyd Mayweather, only fighting opponents he knows he can beat so he wins undefeated
[2:01:05] <Djinnazz> @shujojo games over

[2:01:54] <AJusticeLemon> a W is a W
[2:01:56] <SirKeigan> It's hilariously sad
[2:01:57] <+jiggy_snipe> Minh doesn't want you to diminsh a win
[2:02:01] <+jiggy_snipe> A W is a W
[2:02:19] <VidulaSaix> I mean if they fell off, they made a mistake. No different than them making a mistake and you punishing
[2:02:20] <Lancaster_H> but that's still his fault
[2:02:22] <+jiggy_snipe> that's part of the game tho
[2:02:24] <heckengine> a Warios is a Wario

[2:02:44] <KaiserMario> So Mihn's that asshole...
[2:02:44] <$Superdandy96> As a Incinaroar player, this hurts
[2:02:50] <%BisoromiBear> The less effort you put in, the sweeter the W.

[2:05:03] <Djinnazz> get them DUBS then.
[2:05:08] <$Superdandy96> Fall guys should get a MXC event
[2:05:16] <+glassesaregod> That definitely happens
[2:05:16] <rcand9> possibly
[2:05:17] <Djinnazz> not really
[2:05:18] <LoneFonte> that DID happen on the first week LUL
[2:05:18] <%JustYudha> I would greif so bad

[2:05:39] <%sparkly_yoyo> @WoolieVersus They gave the portal outfit early at the world's best player so they gang up on him
[2:05:45] <heckengine> FUCK Yellow
[2:05:50] <LoneFonte> "Hey that guy has the only costume that costs 5 wins on the first week"
[2:05:54] <Bloodhit> People do that
[2:05:55] <+RedKazoo> @BonzoBeanMachine Fall Guys are canonically 1.84 meters tall
[2:06:10] <+glassesaregod> I've actually gotten to 4 consecutive wins multiple times. Consistency definitely makes it more feasible
[2:06:14] <%huskarl_zap> OH also woolie there a gordon freeman costume
[2:06:18] <rcand9> one streamer i watched got his 5 win stole by a hacker

[2:06:36] <%CalderGaming> pat's in a 4 vs 5 Fall Ball match this game is jokes
[2:06:36] <+jiggy_snipe> it's cowardice but it's smart
[2:06:37] <@Solidus_113> what if they put that achievement in to catch hackers
[2:06:44] <%Josef_Stryker> Just because he's correct doesn't mean he's right Kappa
[2:06:48] <RyuShinden> but MUH PRIDE

[2:07:04] <rcand9> cowards never lose
[2:07:10] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @glassesaregod the way I see it is that consistency is how you get 1 or 2 wins every few games, but getting 5 wins in a row requires consistency and luck
[2:07:11] <sunnythedrunk> EMBRACE YOUR INNER COWARD
[2:07:15] <heckengine> im a proud coaward

[2:14:00] <jolenejustice> what if we got a vergil fallguy?
[2:14:02] <MementoCaedes> @WoolieVersus where u still doing boxing lessons before the rona?
[2:14:02] <%reknownblackcat> @Struggleful like 5
[2:14:07] <Fleet_Admiral_Sakazuki> 20-25 maps, 5-6 levels
[2:14:08] <+ausl0> should be 25
[2:14:10] <barucafe> 25
[2:14:11] <KitsuneManami> Is it Quiet for anyone else?
[2:14:12] <VidulaSaix> There's about 20 total, but round wise it can range from 3-6
[2:14:14] <+Pacifcgrim> 25
[2:14:25] <+N7_cdr_shepard> 25
[2:14:33] <Lancaster_H> because you couldnt get through to higher levels
[2:14:35] <KitsuneManami> Mihn feels louder than the others Regie is really low
[2:14:37] <+glassesaregod> @WoolieVersus There can be 2-7 rounds, but there are about 25 unique stages. More are being announced this upcoming Thursday
[2:14:38] <turbofolk> RNG for stages is fucky
[2:14:42] <ralphfromdk> You got a loooooot of the same ones again and again
[2:14:49] <Zayasu> you also got the same shitty team game all the time
[2:14:51] <tattleworm> you can technically win on the second round if it's slime climb and everybody else gets eliminated
[2:14:53] <@Solidus_113> random based on players remaining
[2:14:57] <T_Sasquatch> We need more , that's it
[2:15:05] <Make_me_mad> Reset the "It is what it is" clock.
[2:15:07] <+jiggy_snipe> it seems it depends on how far you get plus the amount of players left
[2:15:08] <VidulaSaix> Thats more or less what it is, just broken up into rounds
[2:15:11] <rcand9> that would be a cool mode
[2:15:11] <%Struggleful> I get the pathfinder game 90% of the time
[2:15:12] <collind99> The Batman trailer was fucking sick
[2:15:18] <heckengine> its not en tirely random, theres certain stages that only show up at certain points with certain numbers of players
[2:15:22] <DatAsuna> Siege definitely ran ino issues with true random map rotations, people don't expect true RNG, they expect random order linear lists.
[2:15:29] <rcand9> if the added 60 ppl huge map
[2:15:31] <VidulaSaix> You guys didnt see the best Final level, Hex A Gone
[2:15:33] <%sparkly_yoyo> It would be worse, honestly
[2:15:34] <KitsuneManami> @WoolieVersus Can you raise Reggie's Volume a bit?
[2:15:37] <turbofolk> Fuck off batman
[2:15:43] <T_Sasquatch> Fuck team games
[2:15:45] <$Superdandy96> I hope they add more levels
[2:15:46] <mommasboi1> Wooloo play the cool thing he get lot of views
[2:15:50] <tattleworm> hex a gone is king, but the new spinner game is neat too
[2:15:51] <mommasboi1> Wow

[2:16:24] <@Solidus_113> this patch fixes deadzone issues looks like
[2:16:31] <MasterCosmic> its better broken up. Otherwise the last 55 people would instantly quit on a false start.
[2:16:34] <LoneFonte> @N7_cdr_shepard separating boys from men
[2:16:36] <+shry7> what are they gonna play now?
[2:16:38] <KitsuneManami> @WoolieVersus Please raise Reggie's Volume a tad. hes a lot quieter than you two

[2:38:50] <%alexandrecau> Might want a more fighty armor thant the traveller outfit woolie
[2:39:07] <SirKeigan> This looks like a Sekiro
[2:39:17] <shotgang86> "Your nephew has used an alt account to follow lewd accounts like a COWARD"
[2:39:31] <LeBlanc233> Is this about the rise of the first ninja disguised as a Samurai game?
[2:39:31] <+Vostroyan1> "like a ghost of Tsushima or something
[2:39:42] <DatAsuna> nothing
[2:39:42] <Parapattern> The Ghost of Kentucky

[2:39:56] <%xiccy> @Maloane Thanks
[2:39:56] <%Livelinne> None
[2:40:00] <astrophizz> shinobi is Japanese for ninja
[2:40:00] <DatAsuna> shinobi is just the japanese word
[2:40:02] <VidulaSaix> @alexandrecau No thats Kunoichi

[2:40:25] <PrinceOfEden> Shinobi is just the Japanese word for ninja.
[2:40:26] <Arek_1> @alexandrecau Yeah, that's a kunoichi.
[2:40:32] <astrophizz> I was just messing lol
[2:40:34] <%Prevot> and what about kunoichi LUL
[2:40:34] <+Irridium> katana is japanese for sword
[2:40:41] <PrinceOfEden> It's the same thing.
[2:40:42] <%FenixSeraph> *Ninja and Shinobi are literally the same kanji but they're pronounced two different ways
[2:40:48] <%FenixSeraph> Kunoichi is female ninja
[2:40:50] <PrinceOfEden> Like "Ocean" and "sea"
[2:40:52] <BlackermanZX> when does jin get to say Dattebayo
[2:40:56] <PrinceOfEden> Same thing, different words.
[2:41:05] <TigerClaws12> @BlackermanZX cursed
[2:41:37] <DatAsuna> didn't reggie do smash commentary before?

[2:44:05] <%alexandrecau> Shimura can hear the dishonor
[2:44:30] <VidulaSaix> LUL
[2:44:32] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Yeah a lot of the "stealth" kills in this game involve an inordinate amount of screaming
[2:44:40] <%Irridium> GLUACK
[2:44:55] <VidulaSaix> Minh instantly blown up LUL
[2:44:58] <T_Sasquatch> This games lowest point is stealth sadly

[2:45:33] <RajidaViper> Boooo
[2:45:54] <VidulaSaix> Implying that Ronin doesnt look good
[2:45:56] <shotgang86> bullshit, why that is an auto fail?
[2:46:06] <%alexandrecau> I mean you still look good
[2:46:06] <brunoberserk> so white
[2:46:11] <PrinceOfEden> I used Ronin for 70% of my playthrough
[2:46:14] <PrinceOfEden> It just looks so good
[2:46:14] <VidulaSaix> BLIND LUL
[2:46:17] <PrinceOfEden> In any situation
[2:46:42] <%alexandrecau> Mongols have the worst peripheral vision and can'T look up
[2:47:03] <%Prevot> so are mongols just dogs
[2:47:04] <PrinceOfEden> @alexandrecau Don't be silly, Samurai's never go up.
[2:47:15] <PrinceOfEden> No reason to look up.

[2:49:01] <%huskarl_zap> mongols cant look up

[2:49:29] <%Prevot> none of them?
[2:49:32] <%huskarl_zap> theif
[2:49:35] <T_Sasquatch> Mgsv
[2:49:36] <BlackermanZX> metal gear
[2:49:36] <SteelSnake93101> MGSV
[2:49:44] <VidulaSaix> None of them because a stealth game with amazing AI is a terrible game
[2:49:50] <%Prevot> if enemies in stealth games had good AI they would be hard as fuck
[2:49:59] <VidulaSaix> DOSHO
[2:49:59] <T_Sasquatch> Mgsv may be unfinished but its a godlike stealth game
[2:50:02] <+jiggy_snipe> yea the AI can't be too smart
[2:50:33] <%alexandrecau> Hitman is the closest I can think of because if an alarm is rang the targets bunker down but even then it's weak in other stuff
[2:50:39] <%vVAstrAVv> alien isolation?
[2:50:40] <PrinceOfEden> Yeah, I think the best stealth mechanics I've ever seen were in Metal Gear 5.
[2:50:41] <Arek_1> D O S H O
[2:50:43] <BlackermanZX> they have autofire on
[2:50:48] <VidulaSaix> Yup
[2:51:14] <PrinceOfEden> I also REALLY liked the stealth mechanics of Mark of the Ninja.
[2:51:27] <KaiserMario> Phantom Pain could get really hard
[2:51:30] <%jinking79> Act 3 Archers r kill one site
[2:51:46] <VidulaSaix> Yeah and that kinda shit is terrible
[2:51:52] <T_Sasquatch> @alexandrecau which ironicly makes it easier because you can hide in the bunker LUL
[2:51:57] <brunoberserk> in tenchu z , they literally can SMELL you
[2:51:59] <%vVAstrAVv> theyre not even in act 2 yet dude
[2:52:07] <T_Sasquatch> I hate when every enemy knows where you are

[2:53:31] <%alexandrecau> Where is the gundam
[2:53:32] <T_Sasquatch> You'll see
[2:53:38] <DatAsuna> Mongols did get gunpowder from china but they mostly used ballistas with rocks
[2:53:41] <%huskarl_zap> I think its the boxapault
[2:53:48] <VidulaSaix> Dude their necks are sore okay
[2:54:04] <VidulaSaix> Nice whiff LUL
[2:54:10] <PrinceOfEden> "Hey, do you see that guy climbing the ladder?" "That guy in all white? Yeah I see him, but I need to look at him first."

[3:26:47] <BlackermanZX> are ya honorable son
[3:26:48] <Kghaleon> Hey man, they don't have glass windows yet.
[3:27:08] <KaiserMario> Man, the lady just risked her life to save his ass and now he's like "I'll give her the boat ride, 'if' she helps me retake the castle..." Fuck this guy...
[3:27:09] <ashenjuan25> Kinda a dumb code if it says just send fuckers to die instead of you know preserving shit
[3:27:11] <Retinolgaming> Wait, why do honorable samurai have kunai in their castle?
[3:27:14] <+TheNeonGraveyard> Ah yes, like Sun Tzu said, "Dying with honor wins wars"
[3:27:24] <%SaiyanShoto> I completely forgot you could open doors. I always smash through them or slash them LUL LUL
[3:27:34] <+mamekumaaa> どんまい
[3:27:37] <%Prevot> Sun Tzu: "war is based af, pog"
[3:28:06] <+kekkerscrew> And Kratos cast himself from the highest peak
[3:28:09] <ashenjuan25> All war is based on honor
[3:28:10] <%huskarl_zap> Son zoo "I earned that win."
[3:28:11] <VidulaSaix> The games draw distance is insane
[3:28:15] <Buttsoup_Barnes> honour is not poggers
[3:28:16] <+TheNeonGraveyard> Shimura: "stealth kills are not poggers, my guy"
[3:28:27] <T_Sasquatch> Everything the light touches belongs to us
[3:28:28] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Throwing bladed shit is like an entire school of training for samurai
[3:28:34] <%a_goth_pancake> and that's why any time a bunch of animals are in the same place, it's called a "zoo"
[3:28:43] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Especially females
[3:28:49] <%FuqBoiSlim> "WE TAKE THOSE" - Sun Tzu, probably
[3:29:18] <+TheNeonGraveyard> Sun "play to win" Tzu
[3:29:21] <VidulaSaix> LUL
[3:29:22] <ashenjuan25> Also I guess fuck the peasantry under the code since Jin and yuna are sort of the only reason they’re safer from the mongols.
[3:29:22] <BlackermanZX> i think you can climb a tower in a save zone?
[3:29:38] <+D00msDayDan> "watch the backblast, moron" -sun tzu
[3:29:40] <%huskarl_zap> sun tzu "pay to win"
[3:29:46] <%huskarl_zap> "Dont be poor"
[3:29:51] <%Irridium> "gg no re"
[3:30:05] <%huskarl_zap> "I bought this mount"
[3:30:15] <ashenjuan25> “Camping is a legitimate strategy”
[3:30:19] <ZeeR01> "Sometimes you gotta stab a bitch" - Sun Tzu
[3:30:41] <%huskarl_zap> Charlmange" Haha horse run you over."
[3:30:50] <T_Sasquatch> If i had to go to real war I would totally camp
[3:31:03] <%kekkerscrew> Remember you can sell stuff to the Trapper to get more Supplies
[3:31:04] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:31:05] <+mamekumaaa> there are two types of Japanese representations: PSO2 and this
[3:31:08] <DatAsuna> taxation is literally theft now
[3:31:14] <%a_goth_pancake> "end that motherfucker" - sun tzu
[3:31:14] <KaiserMario> OH god blid AF
[3:31:23] <Retinolgaming> Ishi-coward
[3:31:24] <VidulaSaix> Ishikawa, Masako, Kenji and Taka are all optional convos here before you go to the game
[3:31:29] <VidulaSaix> gate*
[3:31:54] <%huskarl_zap> Nepolian at Waterloo "But it was close, it doesn't count because I only had one other loss."
[3:32:06] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ishikawa would totally be the guy in the bike comic to stick a rod in his bike then blame tomoe
[3:32:12] <KaiserMario> Bullshit right there
[3:32:30] <ashenjuan25> Ikkō-ikki “haha gun go brrr,”

[3:32:57] <Buttsoup_Barnes> just get better genitals
[3:33:00] <KaiserMario> I like all this talk about honor and shit, while your people starve, no wonder so many turn to the mongols
[3:33:02] <%Prevot> we one piece now
[3:33:22] <%cobalt_phoenix_> "we know"
[3:33:25] <%huskarl_zap> "Thats not a Samurai hes just a bandit."
[3:33:35] <%SleepyDavid> that was the best duel in the game
[3:34:07] <%huskarl_zap> ooohh
[3:34:10] <%Prevot> I dunno about loyal
[3:34:26] <%Irridium> ishikawa would be talking shit
[3:34:28] <%alexandrecau> Classicist shimura
[3:34:40] <%huskarl_zap> Shes a level 15 theif
[3:34:47] <ashenjuan25> Real talk I don’t wanna spoil shit but I do think the story draws attention to the fact the code is fucking dumb for the peasantry and only really a tool to keep order for the shogun kinda.
[3:34:50] <+mamekumaaa> なんだっけ？
[3:35:14] <Marakami_Sadaneo> heck you Shimura cirREE
[3:35:37] <VidulaSaix> Yep welcome to area 2

[3:35:44] <%cobalt_phoenix_> monkaS
[3:36:06] <%alexandrecau> The game kind of bring the code is to keep the order of the shogun but it'S the only order there is, there is not gonna be a fucking democracy sprouting out of nowhere

[3:39:31] <ashenjuan25> That’s basically a big bulk of Kurosawa movies so I don’t see an issue with the story pulling that angle.
[3:40:17] <ZeeR01> They're mongols those aren't Shibes they're Bankhars most likely cmonBruh

[3:41:33] <T_Sasquatch> D:
[3:41:33] <townzzzzz> cross fire
[3:41:35] <KnivesEve> woolie hype over killing animals still in effect
[3:41:44] <%Sparkseid> Woolie the horse killer
[3:41:44] <%Prevot> that's the least honorable thing so far
[3:41:47] <Buttsoup_Barnes> PETA
[3:41:47] <%TheSaltminer> PETA, OPEN UP
[3:41:48] <BlackermanZX> Killed that hose with HONOR
[3:41:51] <%Estuko> NotLikeThis he's losing sanity over horse murder
[3:42:08] <Kalinflip> enemy horses eliminated SeemsGood
[3:42:12] <T_Sasquatch> Fuck PETA
[3:42:17] <ashenjuan25> “Ahhh you were by my side all along.....”
[3:42:32] <%Estuko> @T_Sasquatch call peta of the horse muder, so when they all arrive we can eliminate them all in one go
[3:42:37] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Also for reference this mongol invasion was comprised of like thirty thousand people.
[3:42:39] <BlackermanZX> peta would just kill more horses doodBait
[3:42:56] <ashenjuan25> End suffer
[3:42:58] <T_Sasquatch> Peta is so bad that an organization for animal rights is somehow hated
[3:43:02] <ashenjuan25> Suffering*
[3:43:05] <coolercatt> Notice his honor won’t let him listen
[3:43:12] <ashenjuan25> PETA: End suffering

[3:43:40] <%kyh9> I KNOW, YOURE A COP SHIMURA
[3:43:51] <TimetodiveLTX> big PETA euthanasia
[3:43:57] <T_Sasquatch> Such an asshole
[3:44:16] <fruit_pie_the_magician> PETA's version of animal rights is "animals have the right to live without human influence, but we're going to kill any of them that have ever had human influence of any kind"
[3:44:20] <%kyh9> Recruit BLM to help fight with the police
[3:44:36] <%Prevot> honor... later

[3:48:53] <VidulaSaix> Norio is dope
[3:49:10] <T_Sasquatch> I didn't realize he was a party member first time he was introduced LUL

[3:50:17] <%huskarl_zap> Kiryu
[3:50:18] <ashenjuan25> The farmer mythic tale armor kind of looks like Shimura’s battle gear if you get it dyed
[3:50:25] <T_Sasquatch> @prevot yakuza 5 guy saying kiryu doesn't kill people made me lose my shit 😂
[3:50:40] <%alexandrecau> fight for honor and fight for peace but at the end of the day everyone fight like a ghost

[3:50:52] <ashenjuan25> Battle monks are fucking dope
[3:50:53] <%huskarl_zap> Kiryu "Haha helicopter go *Crash*"
[3:51:06] <+zanzibar_junker> I'd be hit by Akyma than a kiryu hear action
[3:51:08] <T_Sasquatch> Kiryu has a fucking car gun fight LUL
[3:51:09] <%huskarl_zap> Kiryu "I earned that helicopter crash"
[3:51:15] <VidulaSaix> Yay new area
[3:51:18] <+mamekumaaa> Kiryu is like batman, they say "he never kills anyone" but he legit stabs people in the gut
[3:51:27] <%alexandrecau> @T_Sasquatch even kiryu was like " WHO TOLD YOU THAT"

[3:54:31] <T_Sasquatch> YOU like BASES ?
[3:54:36] <BLVCKHEART> perfect strikes are a different animation

[4:03:33] <$razielhex> It's an evolution, and better for his brand, not just a rehashing of SBFP stuff
[4:03:54] <VidulaSaix> I actually do agree that this feels more like an intro
[4:03:56] <VidulaSaix> But its whatever
[4:03:57] <$razielhex> Also, the Big Band Ending is amaazing

[4:06:40] <CasualAlohaFriday> So is the outro just going to keep getting longer and longer?
[4:06:40] <%ChoculaUltra> you'd be surprised how much of the outro has been changed bit by bit over time
[4:06:40] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:06:48] <%Estuko> @TimetodiveLTX That's fine, that's why I appreciate this as an outro for ppl who aren't into it anymore because they can leave when they get their fill. ♥
[4:06:49] <+jiggy_snipe> yea
[4:07:14] <CasualAlohaFriday> But we have to watch it all the way if we want to see the trash part
