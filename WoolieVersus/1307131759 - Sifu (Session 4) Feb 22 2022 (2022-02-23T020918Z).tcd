[0:00:51] <+TopTieramisu> luke looks better than he did in 5
[0:00:53] <@Menitta> Luke looks WAY better
[0:00:55] <%xerotwo> He is now HOOK from AEW
[0:00:58] <Memitim> Luke looks better
[0:01:01] <+TopTieramisu> he got rid of his cringey tattoos
[0:01:07] <%DashXero> He gave Ashley Riot's hairstyle back.
[0:01:10] <%Shad0wTag> Luke is now a MAXIMUM ZOOMER
[0:01:12] <leith_aziz> Ryu kinda looked Middle Eastern to me. Maybe it's my background influencing my view
[0:01:14] <+TopTieramisu> those star tattoos on his arms were awful
[0:01:14] <BlackermanZX> Ryu is PACKING tho
[0:01:15] <+finalformbm> I just want to say that Big Yellow predicted Big Ryu, but it was for SFV dlc
[0:01:15] <dds333a> @toptieramisu they're underneath his own star shirt
[0:01:15] <LadyAmatsu> Ryu is so cube
[0:01:15] <%Kriss1827> luke looks fine imo
[0:01:17] <+LastHazzerd> the hair looks much better in an engine that can handle hair
[0:01:19] <+JustToWatch> we here you, and we are committed to make Ryu even W I D E R
[0:01:22] <+TopTieramisu> @dds333a his arms though
[0:01:26] <%baka_sugoi> HOBO RYU
[0:01:29] <DrJamesWoods> Ryu is just Chris
[0:01:35] <%xerotwo> I want to see Luke punch that old logo LUL
[0:01:40] <leith_aziz> Also, the background did not help make me think of Ryu as Gigachad
[0:01:40] <dds333a> Luke has the nightmare face
[0:01:49] <%xerotwo> LUL
[0:01:51] <leith_aziz> pickyStronk
[0:01:58] <+TopTieramisu> luke looks normal. it's that wild lighting that turns him into demonface
[0:01:59] <%baka_sugoi> LUL
[0:02:01] <%X2Eliah> Luke Blevins in da house
[0:02:05] <Gadagast> Luke's forearm veins are fucked dude
[0:02:06] <%Shad0wTag> MAXIMUM ZOOMER LUKE
[0:02:14] <leith_aziz> Luke has a psycho smile cohhEvil
[0:02:19] <@Menitta> the problem I have with Luke is Capcom telling me he's super important, therefore I don't like him
[0:02:19] <dds333a> @toptieramisu that's exactly what I mean LUL
[0:02:41] <%Shad0wTag> Luke looks like he's seconds away from getting his phone to record a tiktok with an unwilling Ryu @WoolieVersus
[0:02:46] <+LastHazzerd> in the persuit has mass appeal
[0:02:52] <+TopTieramisu> luke reveals his last name, Paul
[0:02:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> ü§¢ people with hair
[0:03:02] <%Prevot> Yakuza 0 pores
[0:03:02] <dds333a> I preferred Luke's hair in the previous game, other than that, he looks somewhat better
[0:03:04] <DrJamesWoods> i don't think it's realistic as much as it's way more detailed?
[0:03:05] <%RyTYoung> She has peach fuzz
[0:03:08] <leith_aziz> I cant deny my interest lie in Arcsys games (mainly GG), but I do wanna watch this game from the sidelines. If other people are hyped/happy, then im happy pickyProud
[0:03:09] <@Solidus_113> the Yakuza detail
[0:03:21] <user_naim> Suzi was super right about Sweat Fighter 6 tho. Mad hype
[0:03:24] <+LastHazzerd> the mass public doesn't like more interesting things
[0:03:27] <+TopTieramisu> getting rid of the stars on his arms improve his design tenfold
[0:03:30] <%baka_sugoi> HOBO
[0:03:30] <leith_aziz> DMCV had a middlepoint which worked for me
[0:03:32] <%RyTYoung> If you never rest you can see bags form under Aloy‚Äôs eyes Kappa
[0:03:32] <LadyAmatsu> Art style has better longevity than hard realism
[0:03:34] <%DashXero> Ryu's still got them eyebrows.
[0:03:35] <wandelmilch> Ryu looking like a fridge >>>>>
[0:03:43] <leith_aziz> Realistic but still allows for other-wordly concepts
[0:03:45] <+LastHazzerd> but sfv takes place before sf3
[0:03:50] <%Prevot> imagine the sweat flying off R. Mika when she slaps her ass
[0:04:06] <+TheFrancix> it's paci-fist time bros?
[0:04:07] <+TopTieramisu> will sf6 be the first game to go past sf3?
[0:04:09] <DrJamesWoods> @lasthazzerd fair
[0:04:15] <user_naim> @prevot core value for sure
[0:04:18] <dds333a> @prevot sweatgief, sweat Honda, let's go
[0:04:18] <+Jiggisnipe> Ryu and Chun Li don't change
[0:04:19] <+TopTieramisu> i swear capcom is afraid of time after sf3
[0:04:23] <leith_aziz> @TopTieramisu Let's hope so pickyEZ
[0:04:25] <+Jiggisnipe> cept for Alpha
[0:04:26] <@Menitta> I swear to God if it's not after 3
[0:04:34] <+ReallyBigRocks> "We can't change the brand" proceeds to change the brand
[0:04:34] <+LastHazzerd> but time didn't pass
[0:04:37] <%baka_sugoi> "but nostalgia" csbeastSetIn
[0:04:41] <+LastHazzerd> in 5
[0:04:45] <%AlteisenReiseZ> It's Luke so it's after 3rd strike.
[0:04:46] <leith_aziz> Garou Terry, Strive's redesigns. I love reflecting growth in design
[0:04:49] <%DashXero> Give me my 40+ Chun-Li.
[0:04:50] <dds333a> Moving it forward, at last? Kappa
[0:04:52] <%Kriss1827> @toptieramisu honestly i don't blame them after third strike
[0:04:54] <+wmeldrum> third strike set in the year 2099
[0:04:55] <+conqab> where was Luke through the events of 3, I wonder
[0:04:55] <+LastHazzerd> Ryu become Gouken
[0:05:06] <%jinking79> the problem is with Rose's part of the story
[0:05:07] <UnderpaidBob> bricked up ryu LUL
[0:05:08] <%Shad0wTag> From SF2 Ryu has always meant to be wide
[0:05:08] <leith_aziz> Ryu is always depicted as somewhat buff
[0:05:11] <+TopTieramisu> @Kriss1827 you can still bring favorites back. just make them older
[0:05:11] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:05:13] <Astrophizz> getting the scars and his braces removed
[0:05:15] <%DashXero> Yes! Yes!
[0:05:15] <@Menitta> Where else would it be?? The week between SFV and 3. Sean is learning how to HADOU Burst and Bison's grave is being dug
[0:05:23] <leith_aziz> But it's kinda funny that he's basically Gigachad levels of swole now
[0:05:24] <+TopTieramisu> @Kriss1827 hell, 3rd strike chun is her best version
[0:05:25] <%xerotwo> Yung Alpha Ryu is no more
[0:05:27] <user_naim> wide batman energy
[0:05:27] <+ReallyBigRocks> one day he'll just be two massive pecs on legs
[0:05:29] <%DashXero> Thank you for mentioning Oyama, Woolie!

[0:06:08] <+ReallyBigRocks> RE engine: Thicker than a snicker
[0:06:10] <leith_aziz> Capcom with the bias
[0:06:10] <%CavemanInCave> Thicc Redfield
[0:06:11] <Gadagast> Leon still pretty normal

[0:06:21] <%AlteisenReiseZ> KEN, YOU HAVE TO CONTINUE THE REDFIELD BLOODLINE
[0:06:23] <leith_aziz> Ryu with the Kurosawa paint. Dope
[0:06:31] <leith_aziz> @AlteisenReiseZ BUT HE'S MARRIED!
[0:06:32] <leith_aziz> D:
[0:06:33] <%Majkir> Majkir subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! Got this game thanks to your guys' playthrough and am loving it!
[0:06:35] <+Javaa01> But yeah it's very much just martial arts Chris
[0:06:48] <+TopTieramisu> i like luke's personality in that teaser
[0:06:51] <user_naim> as long as they look good moving
[0:06:53] <+LastHazzerd> Hexegon
[0:06:53] <%Shad0wTag> People hated Alex and look where we are
[0:06:56] <%Shad0wTag> I will give him a chance
[0:06:56] <Josef_Stryker> I jsut don't like default design
[0:06:57] <+TopTieramisu> the finger guns is a nice touch
[0:07:06] <Josef_Stryker> Story Outfit is way better which they gladly went with for SF6
[0:07:08] <leith_aziz> I dont "hate" Luke, but when he dropped at the same time as Chaos, I prefered Chaos. That's it
[0:07:12] <+LastHazzerd> i like him in not sfv's artstyle
[0:07:15] <UnderpaidBob> his design in that trailer is so much better
[0:07:24] <%Lion_kun> You also like Blanka so you are used to liking trash:)
[0:07:29] <dds333a> @leith_aziz uh, apples to oranges? LUL
[0:07:30] <%Prevot> hexagonal
[0:07:30] <+vejtables> This Luke design was fire. And I agree the ‚ÄúMMA look‚Äù Is fire as well
[0:07:47] <+TopTieramisu> luke's sfv design must have been an earlier version of luke before they finalized it, huh?
[0:07:51] <Parapattern> 6 emails
[0:07:54] <dds333a> The Grudge Match LUL
[0:07:58] <%Shad0wTag> A different engine could do wonders for Luke
[0:08:04] <%Prevot> they made it bad on purpose
[0:08:11] <@Solidus_113> "tradition" continues to hold progress back
[0:08:15] <leith_aziz> @dds333a I guess? I feel like both had critiscm when it comes to design. I just found Luke boring looking, even if the latter choice is gross for some cohhHmm
[0:08:20] <%CavemanInCave> adobe custom fighter incoming
[0:08:23] <+LastHazzerd> a bad one
[0:08:24] <+ReallyBigRocks> "Oh shit we forgot to make the logo good"
[0:08:28] <%ekodrop> it's awful
[0:08:40] <%Shad0wTag> Also no roman numerals!
[0:08:51] <+TopTieramisu> roman numerals are dope though
[0:08:54] <user_naim> Street Fighter Six Siege vibes
[0:08:55] <dds333a> @leith_aziz I'm not talking about criticism of their designs, I'm talking about the comparison itself falls apart by itself LUL
[0:08:55] <%xerotwo> DISCORD NOTIFICATIONS LUL
[0:08:58] <%Shad0wTag> Its the first they actually used a real number
[0:09:01] <leith_aziz> I think I've heard mostly negative reception towards the logo. Kinda impressed people are bothered with it so much. Oh well
[0:09:17] <leith_aziz> Always open for change
[0:09:18] <%Prevot> I just hate minimalism
[0:09:20] <+TopTieramisu> i can understand them moving away from roman numerals since VI is too similar visually to IV
[0:09:32] <dds333a> I don't care about the logo
[0:09:34] <Blank9> I mean, they didn‚Äôt show much beyond a logo. No gameplay, no new characters.
[0:09:40] <+vejtables> TBH I thought the teaser was almost perfect
[0:09:43] <dds333a> Like, not at all LUL
[0:09:46] <%andrewofbob> andrewofbob subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months, currently on a 11 month streak! This is more of a message to you woolieONEGUY s in chat spoiling the endings: if you wanted to flex to everyone how you got your true endings, you could have just said that you got the TALISMANS and only those who knew what those are would know the context and the feat, and everyone else still on their first playthroughs wouldn't have been spoiled. Good luck on scoring your first TALISMAN today, Woolie.
[0:10:00] <+ReallyBigRocks> if you do a minimalist design it's gotta be REALLY good, otherwise it's just uninteresting
[0:10:04] <Blank9> No real actions in the 30 second trailer, just a dude standing around sweaty.
[0:10:05] <+TopTieramisu> i hope ken's face is exactly the same as in SFV
[0:10:14] <+TopTieramisu> mods, get on that shit when sf6 comes out
[0:10:17] <leith_aziz> I'm fine with minimal UI, but you do lose out on "character" through that, especially if you wanna slam that on the player's face
[0:10:24] <+TopTieramisu> modders*
[0:10:29] <leith_aziz> I kinda forgot he's barefoot
[0:10:31] <%DashXero> Second
[0:10:31] <+Jiggisnipe> he had shoes in SF1 lol
[0:10:35] <%Shad0wTag> Modern minimalist designs suck these days, you need genuine artists to help and not dumb corpos
[0:10:37] <%DashXero> He used to wear slippers in SF1
[0:10:40] <+TopTieramisu> lol ryu's lil booties in sf1
[0:10:43] <+Jiggisnipe> Woolie is a fake fan Kappa
[0:10:47] <@SoushinSen> The sandals will break
[0:10:48] <dds333a> He did wear slippers, yeah
[0:10:52] <%Shad0wTag> HE'S OLD AND HIS FEET HURT
[0:10:58] <leith_aziz> DMCV struck a nice line with me
[0:11:04] <coziestbank> Reggie heart broken over the shoes.
[0:11:17] <+xiccy> Those are Akuma's sandals. He stole them
[0:11:24] <+TopTieramisu> battle designer?
[0:11:32] <leith_aziz> Not working on Bayo 3?
[0:11:39] <%jinking79> it's gonna come down on how the women gonna look in the game
[0:11:42] <dds333a> Like Shinkiro? Kappa
[0:11:56] <+TopTieramisu> oh yeah, the women will make or break the feedback on the artstyle
[0:12:11] <leith_aziz> I hate this new trend
[0:12:12] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:12:25] <leith_aziz> Watch a teaser for the date of the ACTUAL trailer
[0:12:27] <%xerotwo> Why even tease us at this point, capcom
[0:12:30] <+Jiggisnipe> meeting to schedule the meeting Kappa
[0:12:32] <%SirGO0SE> Howd you feel about Ryu's bulge though? debugYes
[0:12:34] <Astrophizz> yeah both IV and V just got teasers, though they were longer years
[0:12:39] <Astrophizz> *teasers
[0:12:43] <@Menitta> That was so bad because not only did previous fighting games have more, but they built this shit up with a countdown.
[0:12:45] <%andrewofbob> Bayo 3
[0:12:46] <+TopTieramisu> i disliked how few body types there were in sfv. why does vega look stocky?
[0:12:54] <+TopTieramisu> i hope they add more variety in body shapes
[0:12:55] <JDlightside> Silksong
[0:12:55] <%xerotwo> They should have shown more
[0:12:57] <+Parrish_broadnax> So that Prime 4
[0:13:01] <%jinking79> the countdown was so dumb
[0:13:03] <%Kriss1827> it all comes down to how much theyll show in the summer i feel
[0:13:08] <leith_aziz> Remember Strive's reveal? Hype buildup with gameplay
[0:13:17] <leith_aziz> That's how you do it pickyEZ
[0:13:24] <dds333a> Kamiya apologized LUL
[0:13:28] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[0:13:28] <+TopTieramisu> geno in smash LUL
[0:13:33] <%jinking79> RE fan streaming the countdown hoping for RE game LUL
[0:13:41] <leith_aziz> @TopTieramisu That's likely Unreal Engine stuff
[0:14:01] <%Double_Tap_That> They put Geno in a better game: Everhood
[0:14:09] <+TopTieramisu> @TopTieramisu i guess. i know the production of sfv was scuffed because of their lack of knowledge with unreal
[0:14:09] <dds333a> based
[0:14:19] <+Jiggisnipe> People need hands on to get the hype back
[0:14:40] <%Prevot> if geno had any votes in that poll, he would've gotten in, considering they got fucking sora
[0:14:51] <leith_aziz> @TopTieramisu It was the same issue with Tekken 7. I'd also say Guilty Gear, but everyone's been getting thicker since Xrd.
[0:14:52] <dds333a> It took a bit LUL
[0:15:14] <velgaduere> it shouldn't take a game 5 years to be good AFTER RELEASE
[0:15:18] <@Menitta> The rollercoaster of SFV's reveal to them continued support was so painful and I'm not ready for another one
[0:15:20] <@Solidus_113> Fighting games have so many problems
[0:15:24] <+TopTieramisu> @Prevot tbf, sora topped the poll by a large margin, didn't it?
[0:15:25] <owazowski> Wait there's a street fighter 5?
[0:15:25] <@Menitta> then*
[0:15:27] <leith_aziz> Arcade Edition was when the game was passable. Championship Edition was when people got interested
[0:15:32] <RJay80> sf5 was my first serious fg and i was floored by the launch
[0:15:47] <RyuuAoi> Seafooo?
[0:15:50] <+SiegmundCG> SiegmundCG subscribed with Prime. 
[0:15:58] <dds333a> @rjay80 in a good or bad way? think carefully Kappa
[0:16:16] <%DashXero> That trailer moved me to tears.
[0:16:17] <+TopTieramisu> and it also said RISE UP
[0:16:17] <%Prevot> @Prevot there's no data for it, and there will never be. but if fucking bayonetta got in for being highly voted, it means no one at all voted for geno
[0:16:20] <@Menitta> It also had a gameplay trailer immediately after at PSX.
[0:16:24] <wandelmilch> real talk the Rise Up trailer rocks
[0:16:35] <dds333a> Miniscule
[0:17:03] <leith_aziz> Not really related, but It kinda irks me that Strive hasnt hit 1M sales yet when every video on Youtube about it has at LEAST 100K views. I've seen several with 2M views. How has that game not reached that threshold yet? cohhSus
[0:17:06] <%xerotwo> I guess there was
[0:17:09] <@Menitta> that SFV trailer leaked and was meant to be shown with the gameplay trailer at PlayStation Experience
[0:17:11] <+LastHazzerd> pandemic made that much harder
[0:17:13] <+TopTieramisu> @Prevot oh well. geno doesn't really inspire interesting gameplay ideas, unlike bayo
[0:17:15] <RJay80> trust me it was bad. LUL sf5 being online only at launch for my first fg. I got my ass kicked alot @dds333a lol
[0:17:22] <+LastHazzerd> but before that
[0:17:34] <dds333a> @leith_aziz GG is not THAT mainstream
[0:17:47] <+TopTieramisu> geno shoots spells and finger bullets. that's about it
[0:17:49] <leith_aziz> @dds333a I'm just talking about Views. Something doesnt line up
[0:17:54] <leith_aziz> cohhHmm
[0:18:14] <dds333a> If views equaled sales, that would be a very different world LUL
[0:18:15] <%SirGO0SE> its nice to see no ui and maybe a little combo yeah
[0:18:17] <@Solidus_113> it's RE engine for sure, but totally not in game I'd say
[0:18:33] <@Menitta> SFV and MVCI both showed gameplay at their official reveals.
[0:18:53] <%SirGO0SE> @Solidus_113 the animations I bet were not ingame but its entirely feasible that those models are the ingame models
[0:18:58] <+TopTieramisu> mvci even tried to fix the visuals because of feedback but it wasn't enough
[0:19:03] <%SirGO0SE> re engine stuff looks that good
[0:19:09] <dds333a> They could use one
[0:19:11] <@SoushinSen> a surprise announcement is fine. a countdown to an announcement is not.
[0:19:17] <wandelmilch> I really want this game to be good
[0:19:17] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1495994438551851008?t=MtwwBoXiBdU6LlIYk0i-Kw&s=19
[0:19:21] <+Jiggisnipe> yea Minh is right
[0:19:29] <JDlightside> still don't really get why the did the whole countdown thing. Seemed like bad execution.
[0:19:31] <+Jiggisnipe> that countdown was ugh
[0:19:36] <dds333a> @soushinsen agreed
[0:19:42] <RyuuAoi> Besides SF, What other fighters capcom currently got?
[0:19:44] <%SirGO0SE> yeah countdowns rub the wrong way
[0:19:47] <leith_aziz> I'll always fight to grow awarness of Guilty Gear. pickyEZ
[0:19:50] <+TopTieramisu> so which RE engine characters will the rest of the SF cast look like? i nominate REmake Jill for cammy
[0:19:54] <dds333a> @ryuuaoi Kappa Kappa Kappa
[0:19:58] <@Solidus_113> no more SF2 speed please
[0:20:06] <leith_aziz> The endless cycle of salt
[0:20:07] <RyuuAoi> @dds333a PogChamp
[0:20:15] <Dakuu75> Because the sequels always do something wrong-as-fuck. idk why.
[0:20:20] <dds333a> The internet never forgets, we never forget LUL
[0:20:22] <@Menitta> woops
[0:20:23] <@SoushinSen> Street Fighter Alpha sucks, Street Fighter 1's the best.
[0:20:35] <leith_aziz> @RyuuAoi Currently? None. SF needs to do weel for Capcom to go back to other fighters
[0:20:40] <Dakuu75> Make Street Fighter 5-2
[0:20:44] <la_squida> Who *does* like the MMA thing?
[0:20:49] <Astrophizz> vanilla SF2 is the only true SF üò§
[0:20:53] <leomuratore> Many people have already disliked the art direction.
[0:20:59] <dds333a> @la_squida me, honestly LUL
[0:21:02] <%SirGO0SE> preach king
[0:21:02] <leomuratore> Specially the logo
[0:21:05] <+Dova573> mvci proved thats not true
[0:21:05] <@Menitta> I swear if people go "Man 5 was so good compared to 6" I'm gonna be so mad lmao.
[0:21:06] <OblivionSword1> you say that but what about MVCI
[0:21:14] <+Kyma1020> but wasn't that Infinite?
[0:21:20] <%jinking79> to bad bout mvci
[0:21:21] <+TopTieramisu> gotta actually see gameplay before an opinion can be formed imo
[0:21:23] <leomuratore> @menitta it wouldn't be surprising.
[0:21:24] <leith_aziz> People focus too much on the meta sometimes
[0:21:24] <dds333a> @menitta this will happen, you know it
[0:21:27] <la_squida> @dds333a ok, now I know one person who digs it.
[0:21:32] <Dakuu75> as long as it doesn't release in this "it's fucking RAW!" state like 5 did then. I'll have faith in 6
[0:21:32] <OblivionSword1> LUL
[0:21:33] <+LastHazzerd> TRUE
[0:21:34] <@Menitta> I know woolieDATTEBAYO
[0:21:35] <+mechslayer71> or have a dogshit roster
[0:21:35] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[0:21:39] <Afrosamasenpai> bodied
[0:21:41] <+TopTieramisu> we don't know how the effects will look, how characters move, or what the environments are like
[0:21:41] <Gadagast> Functions lmao
[0:21:41] <+Kyma1020> gotchya
[0:21:43] <%Prevot> presentation is literally the most important part
[0:21:43] <%xerotwo> LUL
[0:21:44] <+rasend0ri> Really? Look at MvCU.
[0:21:45] <+Silius_Spacebees> MVCI has a bad roster too
[0:21:47] <OblivionSword1> LUL fair enough
[0:21:55] <%xerotwo> CHUN LI in INFINTE LUL
[0:21:57] <leith_aziz> I think the RE engine should mitigate that issue for now
[0:22:01] <+Dova573> man if they have used the RE engine
[0:22:04] <+Dova573> for mvci
[0:22:04] <dds333a> @la_squida guess that's the one LUL
[0:22:05] <+rasend0ri> Lol
[0:22:10] <@Solidus_113> dante face is so bad LUL
[0:22:15] <+rasend0ri> Thank you
[0:22:18] <%notsoy> asura in sf6 when
[0:22:20] <+TopTieramisu> dante looks fine
[0:22:23] <Dakuu75> Give Ryu a god-damn Chris Redfield skin. he can pull it off now
[0:22:23] <+TopTieramisu> oh in mvci?
[0:22:29] <+TopTieramisu> yeah, that was awful
[0:22:31] <@Menitta> I honestly liked MVCI more mechanically than 3.
[0:22:32] <%SirGO0SE> the Dante with a blonde wig as the Ken reveal killed me
[0:22:48] <%DashXero> I just want to see Laura return...
[0:22:50] <+LastHazzerd> i hope it's as fun to play as folk hope
[0:22:58] <%xerotwo> It's me LUL
[0:22:59] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[0:23:01] <+TopTieramisu> "luke, you must continue the redfield bloodline"
[0:23:02] <Josef_Stryker> I just hope I can find myself a new main because Charlie likely isn't back unless we have Time Travel involved
[0:23:03] <+mechslayer71> BatChest
[0:23:06] <JacknZack27> Didn‚Äôt guilty gear strive have bad UI? I remember people complaining about that for a while. Did they fix it?
[0:23:08] <%xerotwo> LUL poor reggie LUL
[0:23:20] <%SirGO0SE> theyre the models yeah
[0:23:22] <%notsoy> not really, they haven't
[0:23:22] <+mechslayer71> @jacknzack27 nope. and yet people still play it
[0:23:24] <+TopTieramisu> @Josef_Stryker charlie got done dirty in sfv
[0:23:24] <Astrophizz> in engine cut scene probably yeah
[0:23:26] <%Shad0wTag> @JacknZack27 Yes
[0:23:26] <+JustToWatch> @WoolieVersus completely unrelated but if you're starting Elden Ring on Thursday have you changed your mind about getting it on PC?
[0:23:27] <+LastHazzerd> "in engine" might be too inside-baseball for a lotta folk
[0:23:31] <leith_aziz> @Menitta I dont think the people who prefer MVC3 over MVCI argue of teh gameplay. Mostly because X-factor exists. There's other reasons for MVC3 love basically. So your taste is completelty understandable
[0:23:39] <dds333a> @jacknzack27 it still does, but the UI is not BAD, it's that it just isn't GG
[0:23:42] <+rasend0ri> ‚ÄúMy name is Chun-lee and i am the most beautiful girl in the world!‚Äù
[0:23:42] <+mechslayer71> @shad0wtag wait they did? was it worse than current before?
[0:23:43] <+LastHazzerd> like virtua fighter?
[0:23:45] <%Shad0wTag> @JustToWatch No not while the fatal online bug is in
[0:23:46] <@Solidus_113> if you want to look at the timeframe of the RE Engine, look between RE7 and RE3
[0:23:53] <leith_aziz> NRS teasers with the damn pre-renders/CGI pickyPalm
[0:23:53] <%Shad0wTag> @mechslayer71 No its perfectly fine now
[0:23:58] <dds333a> The Strive UI is just not the aesthetic of previous games
[0:24:05] <%notsoy> re engine sfm porn Kreygasm
[0:24:16] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[0:24:22] <Dakuu75> is Elden Ring coming out tomorrow for everyone or that's jsut early-code stuff?
[0:24:26] <%jinking79> can't wait for Dante to dye his hair Blonde for SF6
[0:24:34] <+TopTieramisu> it's funny how SFM as a term still lingers even though almost no one uses SFM anymore
[0:24:38] <+LastHazzerd> Ken and Chunners will be litmus tests for art style
[0:24:39] <@Menitta> Didn't Infinite just straight up use 3's models and that's why it looks fucked
[0:24:42] <+TopTieramisu> at least for rule34
[0:24:50] <%notsoy> no, it's because the lighting is really bad
[0:24:50] <OblivionSword1> when does SF 4 and 5 take place ?
[0:24:58] <+rasend0ri> Don‚Äôt even joke about that you sob!
[0:24:59] <leith_aziz> @OblivionSword1 Between 2 and 3
[0:24:59] <+TopTieramisu> between 2 and 3
[0:25:03] <%notsoy> the current chronology is 2 4 5 3 i think

[0:32:33] <RyuuAoi> NG+
[0:32:33] <%andrewofbob> Reinforce it with your thumb inside your finger; it's a strike for soft areas

[0:36:05] <%baka_sugoi> that was a movie scene
[0:36:06] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YEYEYEYEYEYE
[0:36:07] <+ReallyBigRocks> too fast
[0:36:08] <%DkLordG> the bathoom stall scene in The Raid 2 is cool if you want an overwhelming fight in a tight space
[0:36:10] <velgaduere> insanely clean
[0:36:12] <@Menitta> I'm still proud of myself for beating the hallway without dying on the first go
[0:36:13] <spokensun> nice nice nice
[0:36:15] <dds333a> Too fast LUL
[0:36:25] <%Th3SmartAlec> now yeet bottle
[0:36:30] <RyuuAoi> Woolie good at this!
[0:36:34] <dds333a> the pipe
[0:37:03] <%andrewofbob> I feel that the window specifically makes noise when you jump through
[0:37:09] <%Th3SmartAlec> off screen oof
[0:37:09] <+Ricky_Rexx> Why are so many kung fu stories about revenge? Besides the fact that revenge is sick and always cool
[0:37:11] <+TopTieramisu> the legendary art of bottle throw
[0:37:15] <%DashXero> Activating him is good for score.
[0:37:32] <+rasend0ri> This point system is infuriating. Why is it that some kills despite being at 5 multiplier only give 50 but some give 100?!?!?
[0:37:36] <KNYGHT87> scjGreeting @DashXero
[0:37:39] <%baka_sugoi> come on
[0:37:43] <%DashXero> @KNYGHT87 Yo!
[0:37:45] <+Fabpsi_> taunt-cancel, the biggest disrespect when you just decide the enemy isn't even worthy of your taunt
[0:37:48] <$tkuwari> Hello friends
[0:37:54] <%Th3SmartAlec> good indeed
[0:37:59] <+Ricky_Rexx> This point system would be better if they just replaced it with a dmc style system
[0:38:02] <radiorosewater> @tkuwari hello
[0:38:04] <linSP> woolie activating level DIE
[0:38:19] <+rasend0ri> Taunts increase your multiplier by 2
[0:38:29] <+Xx_HD_xX> I'm assuming he's aware of the patch nerfs
[0:38:31] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[0:38:32] <+Fabpsi_> ohhhhh

[0:38:36] <%xerotwo> OOP AHH LUL
[0:38:42] <jubejube56> Ik pat was against focus upgrades but I found my best full run to be with full focus
[0:38:46] <radiorosewater> spiderman moment
[0:38:49] <+TopTieramisu> i love throwing people off heights in this game
[0:38:51] <jubejube56> Stuff like vertical strikes annihilated hard encounters
[0:38:52] <+Fabpsi_> well i think some of the other stuff is murder too, but that was just unlucky
[0:38:54] <+JayCWayC> Pass-a-fist Run :)
[0:39:05] <+Fabpsi_> beat him with the power of MONEY
[0:39:10] <SolidusA> The old martial art of Sha-tra also known as shaft from a truck
[0:39:30] <+ReallyBigRocks> only a fool would surround themselves with this many duffle bags
[0:39:31] <+LoveYouCuzDrunk> rude
[0:39:33] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[0:39:37] <SeigiVA> oh shit we speedin through
[0:39:40] <+Ricky_Rexx> I know it's for balance but why would the character lift an opponent off the ground when wailing on them? Just keep them there
[0:39:41] <RyuuAoi> He did nothing wrong. Poor guy
[0:39:45] <%Th3SmartAlec> Wai Shen
[0:39:46] <dds333a> LUL
[0:39:49] <+SammyOVision> Yeah I think the benefit of having more focus beyond using the 2/3 bar moves is that you aren't wasting them if you're not using them for longer.
[0:40:02] <dds333a> @th3smartalec WHO ARE YOU?!
[0:40:14] <+Ricky_Rexx> Like how in madworld you could throw a briefcase full of money to lure all the jobbers there
[0:40:20] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:40:20] <RyuuAoi> Smooth

[0:40:31] <%cobalt_phoenix_> nice
[0:40:32] <%Th3SmartAlec> good stuff
[0:40:33] <+Fabpsi_> i always think the 1 guy in the bathroom is just reflecting on himself and finally realises he wants to quit this drug stuff and live a normal life with his girlfriend and his 2 kids. Then out of nowhere a girl comes in and kicks him down to dust
[0:40:33] <+softdeadline> the shmoovement
[0:40:35] <%baka_sugoi> F O O T S I E S
[0:40:42] <+TopTieramisu> is woolie mainly concerned about getting the parry buff or is he trying to get as many upgrades as possible?
[0:40:44] <%jonblnt> Reggie going off
[0:40:47] <radiorosewater> KICKS
[0:40:54] <dds333a> @fabpsi_ like that dude in Hotline Miami 2 LUL
[0:40:56] <%Th3SmartAlec> excellent use of table

[0:41:42] <%DkLordG> THE OL DICK TWIST
[0:41:43] <+Fabpsi_> @TopTieramisu just trying to do overall good runs while getting the good-ending. no real set when it comes to upgrades, but i imagine he is going for the more expensive stuff
[0:41:44] <DrJamesWoods> gotta grab it first
[0:41:44] <spokensun> fresh pipe
[0:41:45] <Treasure_Vault> Private room?
[0:41:46] <+TopTieramisu> oh damn, he's gonna get all 3

[0:42:47] <+Xx_HD_xX> Anyone else here watch the 20 mintue speedrun?
[0:42:49] <dds333a> @rasend0ri the R.E.G System has automated hype man modes
[0:42:51] <+LoudReed> I'm still struggling with the museum level
[0:42:56] <%Th3SmartAlec> interesting strat avoiding the angry guy
[0:42:59] <%Shad0wTag> Who doesn't want a friend for the mental and support assist
[0:43:06] <+rasend0ri> Cheerleader lol

[0:43:23] <%andrewofbob> Renegade interrupt
[0:43:23] <+TopTieramisu> denying the comeback
[0:43:25] <+ReallyBigRocks> Woolies preferred terrain is a table
[0:43:28] <dds333a> wall hits Kreygasm
[0:43:30] <+Ricky_Rexx> Have you beaten the squats yet deathless?
[0:43:42] <%Xelhesia> lol this is great
[0:43:46] <%Th3SmartAlec> @ricky_rexx Based off this run certainly
[0:43:47] <Artemisky> oh is this the deathless run?
[0:43:49] <RyuuAoi> Woolie is Chuck D and Reggie is basically Flavor Flav
[0:43:49] <+LoudReed> Reggie is a perfect hype man, my friends just start watching tiktok on their phone
[0:43:59] <+mechslayer71> @dark_fire_fly yeah it was impromptu sessions after finishing bloodborne psx
[0:44:02] <Astrophizz> @artemisky this is the spare run
[0:44:03] <+Ricky_Rexx> Everyone needs a Reggie in their life
[0:44:28] <jubejube56> Woolie is so in the zone that I worry he is going to kill Fajar by mistake
[0:44:29] <+Brightstreak> Is this a perfectionist run? What's the aim here? I just got in
[0:44:34] <%Reverend_Roscoe> !uptime

[0:47:33] <+JayCWayC> You're in my Hobo Dimension

[0:48:00] <xxMylord> Wollie gonna murder him
[0:48:01] <+Ricky_Rexx> The irony of him doing this to spare him while MURDERING the actual boss fight

[0:48:43] <+SammyOVision> You have to break his stamina through parries
[0:48:43] <+Fabpsi_> @WoolieVersus try only blocking next time, it will work better and keep is life up
[0:48:44] <%HeroToxiko> its MURDAAAA
[0:48:44] <%DashXero> It's REALLY difficult to spare people in this game.
[0:48:45] <velgaduere> you dropped his life to 0
[0:48:45] <$tkuwari> can you redo it since you beat it at age 20?
[0:48:47] <mrtanaka111> wuduless fool
[0:48:48] <dds333a> Woolz has the BLOODLUST
[0:48:48] <pepinillomaton> damage structure, not life
[0:48:50] <radiorosewater> this is not wude
[0:48:51] <zanzibarian_hamster> whoops, accidental murder
[0:48:54] <thackattack00> Can‚Äôt deplete H
[0:48:56] <linSP> redo!
[0:48:56] <thackattack00> HP
[0:48:56] <%cobalt_phoenix_> you can hurt him just not to 0 hp
[0:48:56] <%Reverend_Roscoe> HP
[0:48:57] <jubejube56> If they run out of hp you auto kill, so you need to break structure twice
[0:48:57] <+Brightstreak> it's not an attack, you can attack. you just attacked TOO hard.
[0:48:58] <+froduck42> glass him
[0:48:58] <+hoenhime344> rood
[0:48:58] <+TopTieramisu> it's not that you can't touch him, you just drained his hp
[0:48:59] <+Ricky_Rexx> his life bar is a life bar
[0:49:00] <%Th3SmartAlec> Parry
[0:49:00] <+Javaa01> @WoolieVersus Wrong, he ran out of HP
[0:49:00] <+Deosier> not very wude of you
[0:49:01] <DXLelouch24> @WoolieVersus thats wierd, i was able to beat their ass just fine and spare them, Was it patched?
[0:49:02] <wandelmilch> Keep your peace and tranquility
[0:49:02] <+mechslayer71> parry more for structure damage
[0:49:03] <+LoudReed> uncontrollably killer
[0:49:03] <%baka_sugoi> parry
[0:49:05] <+Javaa01> Stop hitting, start parrying
[0:49:05] <%jinking79> gotta keep them at one Pixel
[0:49:05] <velgaduere> you must increase your wu-duh? Woolie
[0:49:09] <+Fabpsi_> yup, best tactic
[0:49:09] <+Xx_HD_xX> Y, triangle can be your biggest enemy when w anting to spare Fajar
[0:49:10] <DaBelovedUnderdog> No you got to do more parries
[0:49:11] <MAX116030> Sekiro rules. Cant let HP drain
[0:49:11] <SolidusA> I ddidnt know if I kill him heel die
[0:49:12] <+JustToWatch> you have to parry
[0:49:12] <dds333a> You went too hard LUL
[0:49:13] <+LastHazzerd> oh actually passive fist?
[0:49:14] <OblivionSword1> gotta be careful not to deplete his hp
[0:49:22] <+LoudReed> lul
[0:49:22] <kkulf_kkulf> people die when they are killed :(
[0:49:24] <+Brightstreak> yeah keeping them alive is way trickier. I lost like 20 years of life trying to not kill Sean
[0:49:27] <MAX116030> Iss about parrying
[0:49:28] <+skyshinecrusader> @WoolieVersus you have to parry
[0:49:34] <mczarklesby> Clean run though!
[0:49:35] <+Fabpsi_> nice run!
[0:49:36] <%Th3SmartAlec> people do, in fact, @kkulf_kkulf DAMMIT
[0:49:36] <DXLelouch24> was it patched Chat? i was able to beat their ass and still spare
[0:49:36] <+Ricky_Rexx> congwats!
[0:49:37] <%HeroToxiko> IT WAS NICE
[0:49:38] <radiorosewater> usually people die when they are killed
[0:49:38] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ez pz
[0:49:38] <velgaduere> hella clean
[0:49:39] <%baka_sugoi> TAKE 2
[0:49:43] <dds333a> Sick
[0:49:43] <Visorak6> At least you dont have to do this one clean
[0:49:49] <DaBelovedUnderdog> Parries break resolve.
[0:49:51] <+TopTieramisu> did woolie unlock everything?
[0:49:53] <+Ricky_Rexx> Show restraint on the homeless sick mute man
[0:49:54] <%andrewofbob> "Yo, sorry I killed you earlier; can we have a do-over?"
[0:50:04] <+Brightstreak> I'm loving this taunt cancelling tech
[0:50:05] <dds333a> @toptieramisu in the squats, yeah
[0:50:08] <ThatVisorGuy> i mean, who hasn't accidentally cut a mans head off.
[0:50:11] <+TopTieramisu> @dds333a i meant moves
[0:50:16] <jubejube56> Do light attacks do less hp and more structure damage?
[0:50:18] <dds333a> no idea
[0:50:20] <jubejube56> I was wondering about that
[0:50:28] <+Fabpsi_> i like this way of "oh god, i didn't mean to!" spirit. Maybe punchgirl is always thinking that at the end when she gets the bad ending
[0:50:28] <+TopTieramisu> @dds333a since he didn't use any xp before restarting
[0:50:32] <+Dr_DangerPhD> the push attack, back+forward square, does little damage as well and is good for the spare run
[0:50:32] <+domovoid> domovoid subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[0:50:40] <+Ricky_Rexx> I love how the whole second run is to spare the actual killer squad, but NOBODY along the way
[0:50:40] <%andrewofbob> @ThatVisorGuy Happens all the time in Skyrim; very frustrating for raising corpses
[0:50:42] <+Brightstreak> why not just run to boss?
[0:50:42] <mrtanaka111> the pipening
[0:50:43] <%DashXero> That's one way to do it.
[0:50:51] <+mechslayer71> can't be a hard pipe hitting......?
[0:50:51] <+MildConviction> woolie laying pipe on these drug addicts
[0:50:56] <DaBelovedUnderdog> You have to do light attack and primarily parries
[0:51:07] <mrtanaka111> woolie a true liberal
[0:51:14] <dds333a> @ricky_rexx as long as the knife isn't used, you can extrapolate Kappa
[0:51:28] <+Fabpsi_> @Brightstreak he takes the long route so woolie has enough points for the "better" upgrades, specially good in the later levels to get them early on
[0:51:36] <Estuko> @mrtanaka111 it's the shoes
[0:51:44] <%Xelhesia> 3
[0:51:46] <+TopTieramisu> DOUBLE
[0:51:47] <%baka_sugoi> csbeastSetIn
[0:51:48] <+Brightstreak> @Fabpsi_ gotcha, I thought he was focusing on *just* sparing
[0:51:50] <velgaduere> oh god
[0:51:52] <velgaduere> OTG spam
[0:51:58] <%HeroToxiko> Pipe Vs
[0:52:06] <+Fabpsi_> sparing and overall good runs seems to be the goal~
[0:52:09] <lazysaiyajin> damnn
[0:52:14] <lazysaiyajin> one mistake
[0:52:15] <radiorosewater> OH NO
[0:52:15] <+Ricky_Rexx> @dds333a idk, some of these hits seem "they don't get back up" like to me
[0:52:16] <thebalticguy1> OLDBOY BODIED AGAIN
[0:52:16] <dds333a> LUL LUL LUL
[0:52:18] <mrtanaka111> fajar got revengeanced
[0:52:26] <+ThePich> mor elike oldbodied
[0:52:28] <%Indigo_Automaton> Sifu? More like Sifool
[0:52:36] <%HeroToxiko> pipegirl got some good hits in
[0:52:39] <dds333a> @ricky_rexx nah, you could realistically envision them living Kappa
[0:52:40] <+softdeadline> i think the run ended when you got hit with the pipe three times
[0:52:43] <+Ricky_Rexx> Like how batman never kills but he will leave you concussed on the cold winter street without help
[0:52:45] <mrtanaka111> klling addicts is not very wude
[0:53:00] <+JustToWatch> if his last run was a perfect run, then he shouldn't need this one to be right?
[0:53:02] <+Fabpsi_> you are curing them...from..their addiction...and..life itself
[0:53:02] <%andrewofbob> I do like some martial arts ASMR
[0:53:03] <+Ricky_Rexx> @dds333a But is that Wude?
[0:53:05] <+TopTieramisu> no one's actually dying... except the ones falling off the pit
[0:53:11] <+roman11777> am i the only one that feels bad beating the shit out of all the short haired punch girls in this game
[0:53:16] <mrtanaka111> sure woolie
[0:53:19] <mrtanaka111> rationalize it
[0:53:21] <+Jiggisnipe> yea
[0:53:24] <%DashXero> The addicts aren't even trying to get you.
[0:53:25] <+Fabpsi_> exactly
[0:53:26] <%Indigo_Automaton> Kappa
[0:53:26] <DSD24> I love that running execution
[0:53:26] <+Jiggisnipe> aren't these dealers?
[0:53:31] <+TopTieramisu> all the guys you beat up are still groaning on the floor
[0:53:33] <+Ricky_Rexx> You're sparing the actual people who murdered your dad but not their random fodder helpers
[0:53:34] <+mechslayer71> yeah but actually these guys are the pushers. you can see the actual junkies
[0:53:38] <+SammyOVision> "b-but child murder"
[0:53:39] <dds333a> @ricky_rexx of course. wude does not have anything to say about turning your opponent into a vegetable
[0:53:40] <mrtanaka111> thats the mentality that ends up with child murder
[0:53:44] <+Fabpsi_> addicts couldn't fight that well! *looks at all the guys on the ground dead with no chance fighting you* WELLLLL.....
[0:53:46] <%HeroToxiko> @Ricky_Rexx there was a whole comic about that one time spiderman forgot to web a guy up at street level, he got mad at the guy for being afraid LUL
[0:53:47] <AnnoyedApricot> probably getting high on their own supply
[0:53:56] <%DashXero> Down by 30 points so far.
[0:53:58] <+furtive0ne> I love how this game shifts from Jackie Chan to the effing Raid when you start slicing necks
[0:54:02] <DSD24> Oh man Woolie is on speed now
[0:54:14] <+Ricky_Rexx> @dds333a I'll have to reconsult my martial arts scrolls
[0:54:19] <+Fabpsi_> this ain't bloodborne, no ones behind those doors
[0:54:20] <%HeroToxiko> LUL
[0:54:21] <dds333a> @roman11777 yes
[0:54:31] <mrtanaka111> guys, im addicted to Wude
[0:54:31] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:54:34] <user_naim> Wude as in ‚ÄùWude been good to stay home guys‚Äù
[0:54:35] <%andrewofbob> Yes, Reggie, rent - aka PROTECTION MONEY
[0:54:38] <DSD24> We don't see eye to eye with Dealers
[0:54:50] <+Fabpsi_> woolie trying to get all the murder vibes out of the system before reaching the boss, true wude
[0:54:51] <+Ricky_Rexx> The real winners are those who called in sick
[0:54:57] <+roman11777> @dds333a BibleThump
[0:55:06] <+pupil31> EZ
[0:55:13] <%HeroToxiko> bunnnClap
[0:55:14] <KNYGHT87> @Ricky_Rexx PrideLaugh
[0:55:18] <DSD24> So is Woolie trying to perfect some levels currently?
[0:55:20] <mrtanaka111> if i kill 100 to spare 1, thats true wude
[0:55:22] <+Ricky_Rexx> The real wude are the friends we made along the way
[0:55:23] <user_naim> that‚Äôs real fucking wude
[0:55:32] <dds333a> This is the spare run of the game
[0:55:35] <+TopTieramisu> that's some good wude
[0:55:41] <%HeroToxiko> @DSD24 trying to no kill the boss
[0:55:41] <DSD24> Oh we sparing
[0:55:49] <DSD24> @dds333a @HeroToxiko Cool thank you
[0:55:50] <+Ricky_Rexx> I love people just using wude in random senses it's true wude
[0:55:52] <+Fabpsi_> @DSD24 perfect would be the "perfect" way to do, but not the main goal. Main goal is to get the better ending, sparing the bosses and having overall good runs
[0:55:55] <Estuko> LUL
[0:55:58] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[0:55:59] <AnnoyedApricot> LuL
[0:56:03] <velgaduere> lmfao
[0:56:05] <+Fabpsi_> death-collection incoming
[0:56:07] <dds333a> LUL LUL
[0:56:15] <DSD24> Eye strike is too good
[0:56:19] <+softdeadline> on that spike spiegel beat
[0:56:25] <%Th3SmartAlec> @herotoxiko it's harder than you'd think LUL , game instills the takedown mechanic into you
[0:56:27] <+Ricky_Rexx> @DSD24 it's just a good tactic irl too
[0:56:28] <user_naim> @ricky_rexx i‚Äôm sure we‚Äôre doing that benjamin guy proud lol
[0:56:39] <mrtanaka111> bet woolie is killing fajar again
[0:56:47] <+Ricky_Rexx> @user_naim it's what he would want
[0:56:50] <%DashXero> Secret badasses are great for your score.
[0:56:51] <%HeroToxiko> @Th3SmartAlec the button push urge is always there
[0:56:51] <+Fabpsi_> if so it will be an accident again
[0:56:57] <dds333a> @mrtanaka111 he wont be able to hold back LUL
[0:57:01] <+Ricky_Rexx> something something wude
[0:57:02] <%Th3SmartAlec> you can make 400 0 I think. play perfect Kappa
[0:57:06] <+Jiggisnipe> again
[0:57:07] <DSD24> To be honest if you really should kill one of the bosses it should be The Botanist
[0:57:08] <mrtanaka111> a true wude accident
[0:57:15] <+Xx_HD_xX> Woman falls off building: Wude
[0:57:27] <ohno58> hell yeah. shit on these fools
[0:57:29] <%HeroToxiko> damn
[0:57:34] <%Th3SmartAlec> @xx_hd_xx gravity is real fucking wude
[0:57:36] <+Ricky_Rexx> @Xx_HD_xX That kill is on gravity, not you. still wude
[0:57:45] <mrtanaka111> endangered fat evil
[0:57:45] <jubejube56> I‚Äôm sure the opponent did not want to fight anymore as they fell off the building
[0:57:46] <+Fabpsi_> still very nice to always have the tutorial on this enemy
[0:57:50] <jubejube56> Classic wude in action
[0:57:56] <DSD24> This feels like everyone playing Disco Elysium where everyone was calling anything "disco"
[0:57:57] <user_naim> Her moneybags go out like lightning
[0:58:02] <+Ricky_Rexx> KOing a man taking a piss is true wude
[0:58:05] <mrtanaka111> @Fabpsi_ tutorials arent wude
[0:58:07] <+TopTieramisu> if they died to gravity, did you actually kill them? wude
[0:58:10] <DSD24> Bust that knee
[0:58:13] <%DashXero> "No knees for you."
[0:58:15] <%Th3SmartAlec> My knee WutFace
[0:58:27] <DSD24> The movement
[0:58:36] <+furtive0ne> That was brutal‚Ä¶ the hesitation
[0:58:36] <dds333a> damn, those wall hits,,everytime LUL
[0:58:44] <NoHeroJoe> damn watching this feels like watching an action movie
[0:58:53] <+Ricky_Rexx> are metal pipes wude?
[0:58:54] <DSD24> Yo we got a badass
[0:59:02] <dds333a> DOREI
[0:59:14] <mrtanaka111> woolie really went from the worse first stage ive seen to the best
[0:59:14] <DSD24> Woolie is focusing
[0:59:22] <Visorak6> You can still get 4k if you maz multiplier
[0:59:36] <+Ricky_Rexx> Just saw a full speedrun of this game deathless in 22 minutes wtf
[0:59:42] <+Ricky_Rexx> That's wude
[0:59:46] <%DashXero> Not enough.
[0:59:52] <+TopTieramisu> i don't care what pat says, weapon mastery's pretty nice
[0:59:53] <DSD24> You got one more though
[0:59:57] <RyuuAoi> Reset?
[0:59:59] <Visorak6> Just make sure you die once
[1:00:01] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @WoolieVersus no
[1:00:02] <+aishman> no
[1:00:04] <+JustToWatch> no
[1:00:04] <+TopTieramisu> getting an extra throwable item is nice
[1:00:04] <AnnoyedApricot> no
[1:00:04] <%DashXero> No.
[1:00:05] <%Kriss1827> now
[1:00:06] <dds333a> nope
[1:00:08] <+Fabpsi_> no, u good
[1:00:08] <%andrewofbob> I think you need to step into the next stage to bank it
[1:00:08] <AnnoyedApricot> it's the first 20 run
[1:00:09] <%Kriss1827> no*
[1:00:11] <OblivionSword1> we'll see
[1:00:14] <user_naim> just buy focus for fun moves
[1:00:14] <+ValHollaYoloson> All it cares is about age
[1:00:15] <+skyshinecrusader> nope
[1:00:22] <+Ricky_Rexx> It always saves you're youngest age
[1:00:24] <sirstohelit> you could always die once to be safe
[1:00:33] <+Dova573> also you can reset it by picking a different level than the club
[1:00:33] <+Deosier> yeah die once to be safe
[1:00:34] <DSD24> Time for the Raid Redemption Room
[1:00:34] <+Fabpsi_> no pipe left
[1:00:35] <+Shoryo_Tori> Spare is tracked separately from all other progress
[1:00:35] <%DashXero> you only need to spare them once ever.
[1:00:41] <RyuuAoi> No death run. I can feel it.
[1:00:41] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @WoolieVersus consider sparing like finding something on the board in the sense that once you do it once it saves it even if you don't do it on your "best" run
[1:00:48] <jubejube56> Yeah just die, give fajar a pity swing
[1:00:48] <+Ricky_Rexx> allowing yourself to die is wude
[1:00:57] <+JustToWatch> you will need to abandon the run after you spare the boss to load the perfect run though
[1:01:19] <dds333a> Stealthing this room is pretty fun
[1:01:19] <%Th3SmartAlec> @jubejube56 a neck slice for old times' sake
[1:01:21] <+Ricky_Rexx> Da boss wants his [drug] all over the city
[1:01:26] <user_naim> i feel bad for the focus moves. they get left out of most common playstyles
[1:01:31] <DSD24> He wants the Blue Magic
[1:01:33] <+Ricky_Rexx> his crime drug that the kids like
[1:01:33] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:01:40] <Gelphaze> WOOLIE!!!!
[1:01:46] <mrtanaka111> is this drug used on the healing center?
[1:01:50] <+RockTB> Woolie's focus face looks like a serial killer and I'm here for it.
[1:01:53] <dds333a> @dsd24 "a product, a brand name"
[1:01:55] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @user_naim linking them to an upgraded bar that requires at minimum 2 shrines to use is no bueno
[1:01:55] <%Th3SmartAlec> what did Woolie get at the shrine?
[1:02:00] <DSD24> @user_naim That Thigh Cut move uses so much bar and its not worth it
[1:02:00] <+Ricky_Rexx> @mrtanaka111 oh shit thats a good idea actually it might be
[1:02:01] <jubejube56> Yeah wtf happens to the main character if they lost their head?
[1:02:05] <Tk254> Happy to finally be part of the audience instead of the YT sidehoes
[1:02:05] <jubejube56> What would the pendant do?
[1:02:07] <$thotbane> too many bros in my mf meal
[1:02:16] <+TopTieramisu> pawnch
[1:02:17] <DSD24> @dds333a American Gangster is such a good movie
[1:02:18] <+Ricky_Rexx> @jubejube56 gray the hair a bit
[1:02:21] <Tk254> schwacked
[1:02:23] <%DashXero> That's actually fortuitous.
[1:02:24] <+Jiggisnipe> it's fine
[1:02:27] <DSD24> You got points
[1:02:27] <+SammyOVision> Well now the 20 run is guaranteed
[1:02:29] <user_naim> @dsd24 @cobalt_phoenix_ yeah like when is anyone going to get three focus bars unless they‚Äôre fucking around?
[1:02:29] <Visorak6> Thats fine
[1:02:32] <%Th3SmartAlec> @user_naim Yeah, the Focus Bar is too costly at shrines imo
[1:02:32] <+JustToWatch> it's fine
[1:02:36] <Tk254> IN THE DICK!?
[1:02:40] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @user_naim exactly
[1:02:41] <+Xx_HD_xX> "Goes upstairs to throw people off the ledge" "Wude,wude,wude,wude"
[1:02:47] <mrtanaka111> 21 is the perfect wude
[1:02:48] <+Ricky_Rexx> so for best result, you need to get no death and spare in the same run right?
[1:02:50] <dds333a> exactly
[1:02:54] <%Th3SmartAlec> ...actually, yeah. huh.
[1:02:54] <%jinking79> correct
[1:02:55] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Ricky_Rexx no
[1:03:00] <+TopTieramisu> gotta love friendly fire
[1:03:01] <dds333a> @ricky_rexx if one wants to
[1:03:08] <DSD24> @user_naim The worst part is that the move doesn't even instant kill, whereas the Charged Knife move is a instant kill
[1:03:09] <dds333a> I was responding to Woolz LUL
[1:03:09] <brunoberserk> ''' why she keeps punching me in the dick ? ''
[1:03:10] <Astrophizz> is there a reason to avoid finishers?
[1:03:12] <+JustToWatch> @Ricky_Rexx just no death, you can spare whenever
[1:03:17] <Tk254> The "Bending the Pipe" trope is so fucking raw
[1:03:23] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Astrophizz probably to avoid powering em up
[1:03:24] <+TopTieramisu> @Astrophizz he wants to avoid secret badasses from spawning
[1:03:25] <+Fabpsi_> @Astrophizz woolie wants to avoid to trigger the "enemy power up"
[1:03:27] <user_naim> @dsd24 buying three focus bars is pretty wude tho
[1:03:27] <%Th3SmartAlec> @astrophizz avoiding triggering enemies that bulk up
[1:03:29] <DSD24> @Astrophizz Yes theres a chance a enemy can get buff
[1:03:32] <Astrophizz> ah
[1:03:32] <radiorosewater> @Astrophizz doesn't allow guys to power up
[1:03:34] <+Ricky_Rexx> How hard you gotta hit a mf with a piece of metal to bend it
[1:03:35] <+Xx_HD_xX> @Astrophizz I think he's trying to get his multiplier up?
[1:03:37] <pepinillomaton> u just need to spare is fine
[1:03:40] <Tk254> CRUSHING the posture goddman
[1:03:47] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @user_naim the most Wude move of all, cut their inner thigh
[1:03:57] <jubejube56> Can‚Äôt become a secret badass if you just straight up kill them
[1:04:01] <DSD24> @user_naim It kind of is cause I liked eye striking an enemy 3 times
[1:04:01] <+Ricky_Rexx> @cobalt_phoenix_ second only to the wude nut shot
[1:04:08] <$thotbane> they going for pacifist?
[1:04:11] <RyuuAoi> This reminds me of True Crimes Streets of L.A. The Snoop Dogg cheat code was the shit ha
[1:04:13] <dds333a> yes
[1:04:16] <DSD24> Yeah you can kill him
[1:04:19] <%Th3SmartAlec> @cobalt_phoenix_ knifing them into the wall as the hold you and gasp their last breath is EXTRA wude
[1:04:19] <+TopTieramisu> wude deez
[1:04:21] <@Solidus_113> it's posture break isn't it?
[1:04:23] <dds333a> This is the spare bosses run
[1:04:25] <bentobeatdown> just break his structure with parries
[1:04:25] <Plughead_> break structure
[1:04:29] <%DashXero> You're going for a dual posture break.
[1:04:30] <+Ricky_Rexx> WUDEEZ NUTS
[1:04:30] <+Javaa01> Double posture break
[1:04:33] <+Fabpsi_> posture break, all you need to do
[1:04:39] <%jinking79> parry a lot pretty much
[1:04:41] <%Double_Tap_That> You need 2 structure breaks in the 2nd phase
[1:04:42] <%cobalt_phoenix_> damn just realized Kiryu is the most Wude protagonist ever
[1:04:42] <jubejube56> Yeah you just break posture twice before their health depletes
[1:04:44] <+Javaa01> Ignore health damage completely if you can
[1:04:44] <DSD24> Actually the most wude finisher is when you stab them in the gut with a knife
[1:04:50] <%baka_sugoi> in stage 2
[1:04:54] <DaBelovedUnderdog> No you just got break posture his life doesnt really matter.
[1:04:58] <%Th3SmartAlec> end of the boss = Evo Moment 37
[1:05:01] <user_naim> @cobalt_phoenix_ oh shit he is
[1:05:08] <+TopTieramisu> @DSD24 the one hit knife stab is peak wude
[1:05:13] <$thotbane> @RyuuAoi nah the best cheat code was the one that made you play a blindfolded smoking donkey
[1:05:17] <user_naim> his box of nails goes out like lightning
[1:05:19] <dds333a> Oh God LUL
[1:05:19] <pepinillomaton> focus on structure damage now
[1:05:21] <+roman11777> back to the hobo dimension
[1:05:28] <%baka_sugoi> yup
[1:05:28] <Tk254> We going to Vietnam?
[1:05:29] <DSD24> @TopTieramisu Front kick into stab is the wudest
[1:05:36] <brunoberserk> unlimited bamboo works
[1:05:38] <mrtanaka111> cannabis dimension
[1:05:39] <hellhound123123> Aren't you supposed to not hit the finisher for the spare?
[1:05:42] <%DashXero> Parrying does good posture damage.
[1:05:47] <RyuuAoi> @thotbane LUL don't remember that one!
[1:05:48] <hellhound123123> Or is that only in stage 2
[1:05:50] <%Th3SmartAlec> @hellhound123123 yep
[1:05:52] <+Ricky_Rexx> The sequel to the backroom, the backwoods
[1:06:01] <dds333a> @hellhound123123 you break their structure twice, and then you know the rest

[1:06:02] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @hellhound123123 ya but if you do too much health damage before that it's still a kill
[1:06:08] <Tk254> Rambo Combat!
[1:06:18] <jubejube56> It‚Äôs also why you can‚Äôt just eye poke them at low health
[1:06:25] <hellhound123123> Oh so you can straight up kill em in stage 1?
[1:06:25] <jubejube56> Focus attacks will kill then sometimes tok
[1:06:29] <%Lion_kun> only need to do it once
[1:06:31] <pepinillomaton> you can hit him a lot before you have to worry
[1:06:33] <+TopTieramisu> draining health is still useful
[1:06:33] <NoHeroJoe> he didn't like all those parrys
[1:06:34] <%Th3SmartAlec> you can still fight normal, just avoid the kill
[1:06:43] <%Lion_kun> You can blow 70 years on this
[1:06:44] <Tk254> Do you bleed black in this game?
[1:06:45] <DSD24> I prefer hitting them and then avoiding the kill
[1:06:47] <+Fabpsi_> yea, you need to get a little bit used to it
[1:06:49] <+Shoryo_Tori> You can attack then, so long as you don‚Äôt fully deplete their hp
[1:06:54] <ALazo> woolie's fighting normal killed him somehow
[1:06:56] <+mechslayer71> oof, avoiding the whole game cuz of the orange limbs has made him not great at parries
[1:06:57] <OblivionSword1> fortunately you only need to spare  em once
[1:07:03] <+Xx_HD_xX> Also do not depelte his health
[1:07:03] <AnnoyedApricot> you have some wiggle room
[1:07:09] <+Javaa01> @Th3SmartAlec You have to play more passively on these more brittle bosses, they will absolutely run out of health if you go full aggro
[1:07:13] <DSD24> Raining strikes is great
[1:07:25] <pepinillomaton> careful now
[1:07:33] <+TopTieramisu> just jabs now would be good
[1:07:36] <velgaduere> now parry
[1:07:37] <+Fabpsi_> only block
[1:07:37] <DSD24> Yes
[1:07:38] <pepinillomaton> again yes
[1:07:40] <+Fabpsi_> parry and block
[1:07:40] <+mechslayer71> parry
[1:07:41] <%cobalt_phoenix_> now jsut parry
[1:07:41] <velgaduere> parries
[1:07:41] <%baka_sugoi> gotta see spare
[1:07:42] <+Javaa01> Yeah just break the bar
[1:07:43] <dds333a> Yes, twice
[1:07:47] <%Th3SmartAlec> @javaa01 agreed, all you have to do is keep an eye on the health bar and parry only when at 10%
[1:07:48] <brunoberserk> *angry hobo noises*
[1:07:49] <+Ricky_Rexx> just keep parrying?
[1:07:55] <DaBelovedUnderdog> Yes now parry everything
[1:08:08] <%baka_sugoi> find sticj
[1:08:14] <%cobalt_phoenix_> it's fine this run doesn't count
[1:08:15] <DSD24> There is a bamboo stick around here that helps
[1:08:16] <+SammyOVision> Tire him out
[1:08:16] <%andrewofbob> There is some bamboo at the edge of the arena
[1:08:18] <Plughead_> weave the knife and parry the strikes
[1:08:19] <mrtanaka111> damn,thats kinda of a chore
[1:08:29] <%Lion_kun> Who cares how many times you die
[1:08:30] <$thotbane> He's Indonesian and has a wild beard and machete. He's supposed to be Mad Dog right?
[1:08:32] <AnnoyedApricot> blocking also raises their posture a little bit
[1:08:37] <+Ricky_Rexx> he's a jungle man he got tarzan moves
[1:08:37] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:08:39] <mrtanaka111> @thotbane yes
[1:08:39] <+mechslayer71> parrying on the way through the fight gives more wiggle room
[1:08:40] <%Lion_kun> You can just reset your age after you get it.
[1:08:45] <%baka_sugoi> yeyeye
[1:08:46] <FloatYourGoat> parrying with weapon should help with chip damage
[1:08:48] <+TopTieramisu> let's goooo
[1:08:49] <dds333a> there you go
[1:08:57] <+softdeadline> nice

[1:09:37] <alroy909> well he's mute
[1:09:40] <+JustToWatch> he's mute

[1:09:48] <$thotbane> YES
[1:09:48] <brunoberserk> '' the 4 elements of HIP-HOP ''
[1:09:48] <mrtanaka111> if we forgive all murderers is the world wude?
[1:09:49] <%Th3SmartAlec> Kappa
[1:09:49] <%Xelhesia> yers
[1:09:50] <%DashXero> Yes.
[1:09:50] <+Dova573> Yes
[1:09:51] <Visorak6> YES
[1:09:52] <+Xx_HD_xX> Sure why not

[1:09:53] <+JustToWatch> yeah
[1:09:53] <%baka_sugoi> Youll be fine
[1:09:53] <+Javaa01> Absolutely
[1:09:55] <AnnoyedApricot> yes according to sifu
[1:09:55] <RedTako> yes
[1:09:55] <+cubbywolf> pure as an angel
[1:09:55] <jubejube56> Lol I mean the others don‚Äôt say anything either
[1:09:55] <+JayCWayC> YES. they deserve it
[1:09:57] <$thotbane> Buddha doesn't care about mooks
[1:09:59] <+Ricky_Rexx> That's what I've been saying this whole time
[1:10:01] <velgaduere> ABSOLUTELY, THEY AREN'T PEOPLE
[1:10:02] <%Th3SmartAlec> Stabbing grunts IS wude
[1:10:02] <user_naim> W U D E
[1:10:04] <DSD24> @thotbane I'll be honest but once I spared all the bosses I went back and killed all of them afterwards
[1:10:05] <alroy909> yes, don't think about minor details
[1:10:07] <+TopTieramisu> holy crap, he did almost unlock everything
[1:10:09] <+Ricky_Rexx> Budha only counts bosses
[1:10:10] <%andrewofbob> You chose aimless murder, not revenge, and that's ok
[1:10:12] <linSP> is this the pacifist route?
[1:10:15] <bentobeatdown> the path to wudr is perfectly soaked in a minor amount of blood
[1:10:16] <+LastHazzerd> time is a bit buggy
[1:10:19] <@Menitta> Aight. I got a meeting and an hour drive after. Have fun! Later y'all.
[1:10:21] <dds333a> @ricky_rexx that's what EVERYBODY'S been saying LUL
[1:10:21] <+Ricky_Rexx> Bosses Rushes are purest wude
[1:10:23] <%DashXero> I love this game.
[1:10:27] <$thotbane> @DSD24 Well fortunately Enlightenment is no-takeseybackseys
[1:10:28] <velgaduere> Fajar grew it for you (this is a joke)
[1:10:29] <DSD24> @Menitta Have a great day!
[1:10:31] <%Reverend_Roscoe> bye @Menitta
[1:10:31] <%TreeLeafBoi> Wude is max!
[1:10:37] <+JustToWatch> non lethal femoral artery slicing
[1:10:37] <radiorosewater> @Menitta later menni
[1:10:39] <+tommy2mato> goons are not accountable towards karma
[1:10:41] <mrtanaka111> he who kills hundreds of grunts,thats wude
[1:10:43] <user_naim> @menitta later
[1:10:44] <+Ricky_Rexx> Kirby true arena? That's wude
[1:10:45] <+skyshinecrusader> Its because youre not angry with the grunts sparing those that hurt you specifically is personal growth
[1:10:46] <%Reverend_Roscoe> check out his picture, @WoolieVersus
[1:10:48] <%Xelhesia> @Menitta o7
[1:10:53] <+cubbywolf> nut punch is good because it skips to the end of your combos
[1:10:56] <RyuuAoi> @menitta safe travels!
[1:11:08] <DaBelovedUnderdog> You need to go to the IT guy in the club
[1:11:10] <Treasure_Vault> Maybe that one tech guy who was at the end of a corridor?
[1:11:14] <pepinillomaton> @woolie if you want I can tell you how to get the top left one, is tricky
[1:11:15] <DSD24> @skyshinecrusader I dunno man some of those slit throats looked pretty angry to me
[1:11:19] <velgaduere> @skyshinecrusader I like how murdering innocents is wude by that standard, then
[1:11:22] <+SammyOVision> The IT guy, yeah.
[1:11:29] <Plughead_> you're missing the IT guy in the club, and going into the burning jit
[1:11:31] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[1:11:37] <DSD24> We clubbin!
[1:11:37] <+Jiggisnipe> time to undeath
[1:11:42] <mrtanaka111> time paradoxes are wude i guess
[1:11:45] <%Th3SmartAlec> may want to check your shrine upgrades in stage
[1:11:45] <velgaduere> gotta unscratch the scratch-offs, I guess
[1:11:46] <%Reverend_Roscoe> E V E R H O O D
[1:11:50] <+TopTieramisu> time is convoluted in the path to Wude
[1:11:56] <%Th3SmartAlec> WHAT
[1:11:57] <+JustToWatch> just reset the level
[1:11:58] <+cubbywolf> if you could kill and forgive your enemies that would make forgiveness easier
[1:11:59] <+skyshinecrusader> @DSD24 Thats character choice though
[1:12:01] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @WoolieVersus the age it shows is your youngest
[1:12:03] <%DashXero> @pepinillomaton Could you tell me because I'm trying to figure it out.
[1:12:03] <pepinillomaton> reset
[1:12:06] <Plughead_> this counts the run
[1:12:09] <DSD24> @skyshinecrusader That's a fair point
[1:12:10] <+cubbywolf> your run from last time is continueing
[1:12:12] <+Dova573> you gotta reset it
[1:12:15] <+TaifuDragon> When you next 'reset' the run it'll go to your best
[1:12:16] <user_naim> when you go in sequence, it carries over
[1:12:17] <mczarklesby> Just quit and restart.
[1:12:22] <+Jiggisnipe> so weird
[1:12:24] <%Th3SmartAlec> NotLikeThis Just let me pick
[1:12:26] <velgaduere> that's weird
[1:12:26] <+Ricky_Rexx> Time is wude
[1:12:28] <%cobalt_phoenix_> it's kinda jank, i don't like this system
[1:12:29] <+Xx_HD_xX> Ehh, I do not like it
[1:12:30] <radiorosewater> obtuse
[1:12:31] <brunoberserk> this feels like a bug
[1:12:35] <tuckerdonovan> devs mentioned they're going to patch that
[1:12:40] <user_naim> Like you can do a run if you go in sequence
[1:12:42] <+cubbywolf> its so you can do a continues run
[1:12:43] <+JayCWayC> You can reset and do it again with the kill, the spare still stays.
[1:12:43] <+skyshinecrusader> @velgaduere You dont have to kill anyone technically
[1:12:45] <DSD24> No fucking way its Jane Sifu!
[1:12:54] <+JustToWatch> @brunoberserk it isn't, it's a design oversight
[1:12:57] <xxMylord> It makes sense if you want to try one contiuse run, would suck if you would always de age so can't do it.
[1:13:05] <%cobalt_phoenix_> "bring it o-" *punch*
[1:13:10] <+Ricky_Rexx> Is that the  Wu De Clan?
[1:13:11] <jubejube56> They who know wude and weird age mechanics can achieve enlightenment
[1:13:12] <+pupil31> D:
[1:13:16] <mckraven> Hey chat, woolie, and reggie I just got here what did I miss?

[1:13:33] <user_naim> @mckraven we defeated fajar with wude
[1:13:35] <velgaduere> @velgaduere I'm pretty sure you have to drop the HP of these grunts to zero, which is death
[1:13:41] <DSD24> She's gotta go

[1:14:06] <DSD24> I love this song
[1:14:06] <kkulf_kkulf> "I just work here" *bonk*
[1:14:14] <+skyshinecrusader> @velgaduere Untrue because many grunts roll around in the floor after
[1:14:33] <NoHeroJoe> wrong day to go clubbing for her
[1:14:34] <velgaduere> @velgaduere hmm, maybe so then
[1:14:39] <%cobalt_phoenix_> SourPls
[1:14:41] <+cubbywolf> time to die
[1:14:46] <+cubbywolf> haha
[1:14:48] <DSD24> You know people already modded in new moves for this game?
[1:14:49] <+TopTieramisu> HE JUMPED IT
[1:14:50] <+cubbywolf> LETS GO
[1:14:52] <+cubbywolf> DEAD
[1:14:52] <kkulf_kkulf> ded
[1:14:56] <RyuuAoi> Strobe lights should be going crazy rn like in every Batman club scene fight
[1:14:58] <%DashXero> Man. These guys really love the superman punch.
[1:14:59] <velgaduere> OH THE SUPERMAN PUNCH IS A DODGE
[1:15:01] <+cubbywolf> LUL
[1:15:08] <pepinillomaton> do it coward
[1:15:10] <dds333a> just get through
[1:15:10] <%Lion_kun> Does the score matter?
[1:15:11] <velgaduere> rip parry impact
[1:15:12] <+PopotoGaius> Does the score affect progression?
[1:15:13] <Estuko> @DSD24 Watched CJ beat everyone to a pulp in SIFU, was nice.
[1:15:14] <mrtanaka111> wude>score
[1:15:16] <%cobalt_phoenix_> "not going for a perfect run"
[1:15:24] <dds333a> @lion_kun not towards sparing
[1:15:25] <+cubbywolf> for the club, you can either wrap around back to the 1st dragon or just get high enough score by the end usually
[1:15:25] <+TopTieramisu> i kinda wish the player can use the superman punch
[1:15:30] <+JustToWatch> the score only matters for upgrades
[1:15:33] <+TopTieramisu> but i guess it's very un-kungfuish
[1:15:35] <user_naim> he‚Äôll probably get the score once he just plays normally
[1:15:36] <+LastHazzerd> Dan is Wude
[1:15:37] <DSD24> @Estuko I liked Big Smoke as the bigger enemies
[1:15:37] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1495994438551851008?t=MtwwBoXiBdU6LlIYk0i-Kw&s=19
[1:15:40] <%Lion_kun> Doesn't Woolie have all the upgrades he needs?
[1:15:41] <jubejube56> Perfect run or not, if you die on the dance floor restarting is the only option
[1:15:47] <velgaduere> @TopTieramisu wym it's the ultimate kung-fu move
[1:15:48] <+cubbywolf> this poor guy isnt even a threat and woolie beats him
[1:15:51] <dds333a> @jubejube56 based
[1:16:00] <DSD24> @cubbywolf He had to go
[1:16:02] <user_naim> @cubbywolf oh i never thought of leaving the first shrine for later
[1:16:15] <DSD24> Ahahahah
[1:16:16] <+cubbywolf> yeah you can get back on this level to this area
[1:16:27] <DSD24> I keep thinking about that meme now
[1:16:28] <+cubbywolf> but you can get a high score just going through the burning
[1:16:37] <+TopTieramisu> @TopTieramisu i'd probably take a one inch punch over superman punch
[1:16:40] <velgaduere> HOLY SHIT
[1:16:43] <%DashXero> Down the stairs!
[1:17:01] <RyuuAoi> Imagine being kicked down the stairs. I'd be so pissed.
[1:17:03] <user_naim> warned you about stairs bro
[1:17:09] <mckraven> man imagine going to your minimum job at a club one day and all of the sudden someone is just kicking you in the face for being there
[1:17:11] <%HeroToxiko> going limp is so op for avoiding floor damage irl
[1:17:16] <%DashXero> Get on the dance floor!
[1:17:22] <+TopTieramisu> i swear, girls with the boots are the worst enemies in this game
[1:17:25] <dds333a> @ryuuaoi if you live
[1:17:26] <%cobalt_phoenix_> fuck yea kick girl
[1:17:26] <user_naim> @mckraven on the other hand you get to hit the customers

[1:17:37] <+softdeadline> gotta fight this cyberpunk 2077 npc
[1:17:38] <+TheFrancix> the club has the best music
[1:17:41] <DSD24> @TopTieramisu The Blade Feet ladies are the worst
[1:17:44] <lazysaiyajin> nahh

[1:21:03] <Plughead_> no, it's always been here
[1:21:03] <velgaduere> it was always there
[1:21:04] <jubejube56> Time is convoluted in wude
[1:21:05] <+TopTieramisu> @cobalt_phoenix_ literally do the throw command towards a pit or railing
[1:21:08] <user_naim> dude why do you work here
[1:21:09] <radiorosewater> what a cool guy
[1:21:12] <%jinking79> yes
[1:21:14] <OblivionSword1> that option unlocked after you interact with the computer in the tower
[1:21:15] <+JustToWatch> nope. just had to examine the computer
[1:21:17] <mrtanaka111> dudes chaotic neutral
[1:21:18] <DaBelovedUnderdog> No going to the yower once unlocks
[1:21:19] <+cubbywolf> its not brand new
[1:21:20] <MadBaller123> Have they discussed how despite sparing a boss you still get to kill their goons?
[1:21:21] <Pookiedaexzile> It knows
[1:21:21] <jubejube56> It was there the second you check the computer on level 4
[1:21:21] <+Javaa01> It unlocks when you touch the PC
[1:21:23] <DSD24> @cobalt_phoenix_ Its a really useful move
[1:21:26] <+Javaa01> Sparing does nothing
[1:21:26] <+aishman> No it's because of the computer clue
[1:21:27] <DXLelouch24> @WoolieVersus nope that was always there
[1:21:27] <dds333a> Now beat his ass
[1:21:27] <Pookiedaexzile> It knows, you have moves unlocked
[1:21:29] <+cubbywolf> look at that detective board!
[1:21:29] <knownstabber> sparing didn't do it
[1:21:31] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ohhh i forget you can throw em like that thank you @DSD24 and @TopTieramisu
[1:21:34] <DSD24> Thanks Hackerman

[1:24:15] <+gitgouda> nailed the landing
[1:24:18] <DSD24> I like the long hair girl's design in this area
[1:24:18] <+cubbywolf> they are delayed in how they attack you if you just stand there
[1:24:30] <+cubbywolf> going up the walls aggros them all i think
[1:24:33] <+TopTieramisu> CAN YOU THROW THEM IN THE WELL?
[1:24:40] <+TopTieramisu> i have to know
[1:24:46] <+Fabpsi_> no, sadly

[1:25:18] <+Jiggisnipe> @DSD24 yea it's cool, would prefer sneakers or some shoes tho
[1:25:26] <+cubbywolf> she will catch fire if you are doing really well i find

[1:25:59] <DSD24> @Jiggisnipe Oh for sure, Sifu's got a great set of enemy designs
[1:26:00] <+Fabpsi_> all for the score
[1:26:01] <+TopTieramisu> no sneaking up on her
[1:26:18] <kkulf_kkulf> LUL
[1:26:19] <user_naim> props for fighting her, and not just tossing her over the railing
[1:26:20] <%DashXero> Whoopin' ass is the ultimate forgiveness.
[1:26:21] <+cubbywolf> try and get these next 3 with 5x or you wont get 5k for the upgrade
[1:26:23] <+TopTieramisu> the art direction in this level is the best
[1:26:23] <+Fabpsi_> that is the spirit reggie!
[1:26:24] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[1:26:26] <DSD24> It was murder tho
[1:26:28] <dds333a> I'll beat your ass, but I won't kill you
[1:26:30] <mrtanaka111> repeat it with me
[1:26:31] <mrtanaka111> wude
[1:26:36] <NoHeroJoe> one does not avoid stepping on ants when walking towards a goal
[1:26:37] <DSD24> Farjar did slit your throat
[1:26:39] <+TopTieramisu> i think the club is unmatched in this game for direction
[1:26:41] <+gitgouda> wish absolver had staves
[1:26:42] <dds333a> I'll beat your ass, and male you live with the defeat
[1:26:47] <DSD24> But hey man Wude
[1:26:50] <Gadagast> I broke this guys neck for the right reasons this time
[1:26:52] <kkulf_kkulf> "I'm gonna beat your ass and you are going to enjoy it!"
[1:26:54] <Mach_Bassh> imagine the game where you just go through the club saying sorry to everyone
[1:26:58] <dds333a> That way you always remember who beat you
[1:26:59] <jubejube56> It‚Äôs not murder so long as it‚Äôs a blunt weapon or a broken bottle - wude master
[1:27:00] <mrtanaka111> logic is not wude
[1:27:13] <Plughead_> parry weapons with weapons is the tech I find
[1:27:13] <DSD24> The duo
[1:27:14] <+cubbywolf> parrying bladed weapons still hurts for some reason
[1:27:16] <velgaduere> this fuckin room
[1:27:20] <TheBadonkulator> so is each environment basically just an homage to a different movie?
[1:27:28] <+cubbywolf> nice 5k
[1:27:33] <pepinillomaton> close
[1:27:33] <+Fabpsi_> enough for the 5k upgrade!
[1:27:35] <user_naim> it does kind of make sense though, as in ‚Äùi‚Äôm getting over my vengeance by proving i own you fucks‚Äù
[1:27:38] <hellhound123123> Yo that was clean
[1:27:42] <+Fabpsi_> niiiice
[1:27:44] <+cubbywolf> the parry upgrade is the only one that's essential
[1:27:44] <velgaduere> oh that's enough for parry impact
[1:27:45] <+TopTieramisu> WUDE
[1:27:48] <DSD24> Now we are super parry
[1:27:52] <NoHeroJoe> the finishers in this game are too good
[1:27:53] <spokensun> nice!
[1:27:58] <%Lion_kun> Woolie stopped worrying about his points and got them naturally
[1:27:59] <+cubbywolf> oh but you're 21
[1:28:02] <%cobalt_phoenix_> now do this with as few deaths and you never have to worry about stress
[1:28:03] <+cubbywolf> throw this run in the trash
[1:28:08] <Pookiedaexzile> 21 too old
[1:28:14] <DSD24> @user_naim Oh I get that idea of it, in Dishonored had a really good version of that
[1:28:17] <bentobeatdown> gotta parry most of his second phase
[1:28:17] <kkulf_kkulf> 21? too old DansGame
[1:28:21] <%cobalt_phoenix_> worry about points* lmao
[1:28:26] <+roman11777> @kkulf_kkulf reddit moment
[1:28:27] <+Fabpsi_> you can block/parry the usual swings - you will take a little bit dmg but it works.
[1:28:32] <+TaifuDragon> Just parry every swing
[1:28:33] <%baka_sugoi> you can parry stick
[1:28:33] <OblivionSword1> the staff can be parried but it is tricky
[1:28:41] <Plughead_> second phase is what matters, you can burn his life in phase 1
[1:28:41] <velgaduere> blocking also works to a degree @WoolieVersus
[1:28:41] <jubejube56> You can also try parrying the shoulder checks
[1:28:43] <radiorosewater> @kkulf_kkulf like a smash tournament
[1:28:46] <+aishman> You can parry his shoulder tackle
[1:28:59] <user_naim> @dsd24 oh yeah it does remind me of that
[1:29:02] <+Fabpsi_> blocking and parry works wonders over time, but it can be rough if you need to get used to it
[1:29:11] <+cubbywolf> I think you can parry but you still take structure damage so its impossible to tell
[1:29:12] <pepinillomaton> you can parry everything
[1:29:17] <wibbwobbler> Dodging more often than blocking
[1:29:18] <+cubbywolf> you have a trash run my trash liege
[1:29:39] <DaBelovedUnderdog> Yeah timing is key .as long as its not a knife weapon you wont take much damage
[1:29:39] <DSD24> @user_naim Also Daredevil when Daredevil beat Kingpin so bad and was just screaming at him going "I BEAT YOU"
[1:29:40] <Gadagast> smoking give flame powers kids
[1:29:49] <user_naim> @dsd24 oh yeah exactly that
[1:29:49] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:29:50] <+cubbywolf> those burn marks seem... bad for a martial artist to have
[1:30:00] <+Fabpsi_> no, bandages give flame-powers, don't ask why
[1:30:00] <DSD24> I like this fight a lot
[1:30:02] <user_naim> @dsd24 that was sick
[1:30:02] <OtakuSnake1> Parrys and deflects take less structure than a block. So you parry a few, then dodge when you need to recover
[1:30:10] <+cubbywolf> parrying with a weapon does work better against other weapons
[1:30:24] <mrtanaka111> is it Wude if the balls touch?
[1:30:27] <+Fabpsi_> i love the klankklankklank with the staff
[1:30:40] <ALazo> enemies lose a bit of structure when they block too btw
[1:30:42] <+cubbywolf> I wish parrying would be uniform in how it works in this game, but some attacks you parry just let them flow into other attacks while other parries let you counter
[1:30:44] <user_naim> @mrtanaka111 did they go out like lightning
[1:30:52] <velgaduere> make sure to grab a weapon before the phase change
[1:30:56] <Estuko> @mrtanaka111 then it turns to "dude!" LUL
[1:30:57] <DaBelovedUnderdog> Try to grab a new staff b4 second phase
[1:31:05] <%Th3SmartAlec> Pray for zero sweeps
[1:31:10] <velgaduere> too late
[1:31:12] <+Fabpsi_> now all the sweeps
[1:31:24] <dds333a> Woolz has downloaded this guy
[1:31:28] <+cubbywolf> triple kick?
[1:31:33] <UnderpaidBob> just better for blocking
[1:31:35] <dds333a> This is his first time sparing him, however
[1:31:35] <velgaduere> weapons do more structure damage, but hey
[1:31:35] <+cubbywolf> yes*
[1:31:36] <kkulf_kkulf> pants on fire
[1:31:40] <xxMylord> Weapons remove chip dammage from weapons
[1:31:46] <ihaveSOAP> parrying with weapons does make it a little easier, does my posture damage
[1:31:48] <%Deasmeister> weapons stop chip damage on blades
[1:31:49] <+cubbywolf> they dont change how it works or anything, just the animation and damage
[1:31:50] <ihaveSOAP> more*
[1:31:51] <+Fabpsi_> "3rd options appears" I'm Batman!
[1:32:05] <mrtanaka111> bitch ass ghosts
[1:32:05] <+cubbywolf> starts with a low, this cheeky bastard
[1:32:06] <DaBelovedUnderdog> True it just helps reducinh structure damage when blocking
[1:32:07] <+TopTieramisu> i don't think staff does chip damage
[1:32:12] <+TopTieramisu> only bladed weapons do chip
[1:32:14] <DSD24> "You killed my father!" "Do you have the slightest how little that narrows it down?"
[1:32:26] <DSD24> Man I messed up the quote
[1:32:26] <+cubbywolf> I think this staff does because it's on fire
[1:32:32] <+Fabpsi_> close enough
[1:32:48] <+cubbywolf> THE OL DICK PUNCH
[1:33:05] <user_naim> Jane Sifu, The Dick Disruptor
[1:33:07] <+Fabpsi_> well that was a good attempt
[1:33:10] <velgaduere> I mean
[1:33:13] <velgaduere> look at his structure
[1:33:15] <+mechslayer71> never seen him go that hard before Jesus
[1:33:15] <+TopTieramisu> holy shit, i've never seen him do that move 3 times in a row
[1:33:22] <+cubbywolf> yeah, parrying weapon glowing attacks usually dont work except for low lvl enemies where it does work. game...
[1:33:39] <knownstabber> tbf the thing is on fire hard to see
[1:33:40] <kkulf_kkulf> ded
[1:33:41] <DSD24> Ouch
[1:33:41] <+cubbywolf> oof
[1:33:48] <%baka_sugoi> ouch
[1:33:48] <velgaduere> it's fine
[1:33:54] <%cobalt_phoenix_> 22 is still good
[1:34:00] <+Fabpsi_> and now we all know, if you are brave enough you can just block fire
[1:34:01] <user_naim> we can take some licks
[1:34:05] <kkulf_kkulf> 22? boomer
[1:34:11] <+cubbywolf> he's hard to fight when he's glowing red
[1:34:24] <%Th3SmartAlec> noice

[1:35:00] <Pookiedaexzile> Eduw
[1:35:04] <Gadagast> I like the vacant smile after these, of "yeah I totally could've killed you :) "
[1:35:08] <brunoberserk> W U D E
[1:35:18] <ihaveSOAP> you do more structure damage when parrying with weapons
[1:35:20] <DaBelovedUnderdog> Now kuroki is hard because she does chip damage
[1:35:46] <+TopTieramisu> kuroki's the worst to no death. phase 1 that is
[1:35:49] <Plughead_> you're kinda supposed to take breaks and weave to build back up structure in-between parries
[1:35:49] <+Javaa01> @DaBelovedUnderdog Eh, her chip damage drops a ton in the 2nd phase
[1:35:50] <+Shoryo_Tori> That‚Äôs not just weapons
[1:35:51] <+Fabpsi_> look at that huge tree
[1:35:53] <+skyshinecrusader> It would be cool to see a mod of the bosses fighting. I wonder how it would be.
[1:35:53] <user_naim> Are there soft parries and hard parries for those staff hits?

[1:36:08] <DaBelovedUnderdog> Yeah thats parrying with a weapon offsets that kind of
[1:36:12] <+Shoryo_Tori> There are a lot of strings in the game where your parry won‚Äôt stagger until a later hit
[1:36:13] <DSD24> @Ricky_Rexx Hot Coldman?
[1:36:17] <OtakuSnake1> The continuing lets you stack maaad structure damage on them though. It's a good thing
[1:36:25] <bentobeatdown> parry then dodge to lower your own structure
[1:36:26] <dds333a> @dsd24 almost definitely LUL
[1:36:30] <jumpyhugs> Flameo, Hotman
[1:36:35] <%cobalt_phoenix_> what was your youngest club run?
[1:36:48] <+Ricky_Rexx> @cobalt_phoenix_ 17, oh you meant in the game?
[1:36:52] <+Shoryo_Tori> You can tell if your parry was successful on a move you can‚Äôt interrupt but a unique particle effect on impact
[1:36:53] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:36:58] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Ricky_Rexx LUL
[1:37:08] <%Th3SmartAlec> i got to Sanctuary at 20 and was like "I can accept beating the game at 26" LUL
[1:37:11] <+Javaa01> Yang is still gonna make you mald, no matter how you handle it
[1:37:27] <velgaduere> gonna have to be blocking with a weapon, somehow
[1:37:32] <ihaveSOAP> i love how you can technically kill SCORES of enemies, but then spare the boss like "yeah i''m the good guy :) "
[1:37:42] <%Deasmeister> Room on top floor
[1:37:49] <+SammyOVision> Don't know what you're still missing in the club.
[1:37:50] <DSD24> @ihaveSOAP Its why I like the first ending the best
[1:37:51] <jubejube56> To get that artifact you need to go to the computer first iirc
[1:38:02] <%andrewofbob> Lets count knifed mooks
[1:38:06] <+Fabpsi_> If you want to know how to get the last artifact from "the club", there is a ncie little hint available
[1:38:23] <DaBelovedUnderdog> You need something from the computef at the tower first
[1:38:26] <+SammyOVision> Don't have the key for that yet, might be locked behind a different door
[1:38:32] <%Deasmeister> no key yet
[1:38:33] <OblivionSword1> not yet
[1:38:49] <%Th3SmartAlec> need time stop
[1:39:11] <%andrewofbob> Not dead
[1:39:11] <DSD24> Spared em
[1:39:12] <velgaduere> gonna need Hard Knuckle to get through that door
[1:39:13] <+Ricky_Rexx> Same on fajar
[1:39:14] <+SammyOVision> They're circled because you spared them
[1:39:14] <+JustToWatch> oh cool I didn't notice the picture thing before
[1:39:17] <%Gruhunchously> 'Cause he ain't dead
[1:39:22] <DSD24> Absolutely w u d e
[1:39:28] <+Javaa01> The thumb tack is red on items that have connections to other items
[1:39:29] <+Ricky_Rexx> X's aren't wude
[1:39:39] <bentobeatdown> ye
[1:39:43] <+TopTieramisu> what wude jesus do?
[1:39:46] <DSD24> Museum is the best level tho
[1:39:53] <mrtanaka111> soooo,what actually IS wude after all?
[1:40:03] <+Javaa01> I mean, worst comes to worst, you lose like three minutes
[1:40:04] <%Gruhunchously> I like how our protagonist is, at the end of  the day, a murderous conspiracy theorist
[1:40:04] <+Ricky_Rexx> @mrtanaka111 the friends you make along the way
[1:40:05] <%andrewofbob> That's a silhouette of a key on the tower board
[1:40:05] <+TopTieramisu> meseum is cool, but fk that last section
[1:40:09] <+TopTieramisu> museum*
[1:40:18] <UnderpaidBob> 2nd phase of the museum boss gave me MGR Monsoon vibes big time
[1:40:21] <+softdeadline> youtube thumbnail w/ shawn circled and character doing a shocked face "I SPARED SHAWN??"
[1:40:24] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @WoolieVersus what was your youngest museum run?
[1:40:24] <+Jiggisnipe> wude, disco, hiphop
[1:40:28] <ihaveSOAP> anything you haven't permenantly unlocked will be GAWN
[1:40:30] <user_naim> So in a game of tic tac toe, one player is wude
[1:40:33] <%andrewofbob> Only if you walked into the stage this age or younger previously
[1:40:35] <+Jiggisnipe> 3 of the 5 elements
[1:40:36] <OblivionSword1> what's the youngest age you had in the museum ?
[1:40:45] <%Gruhunchously> This is your brain on wude
[1:40:45] <jubejube56> Idk which wude timeline are we on atm
[1:40:47] <+JustToWatch> what was your best club run before?
[1:40:54] <velgaduere> you sure can
[1:41:01] <+rrratbastard> turn off the wude inhibitors in your mind cabinet
[1:41:02] <mrtanaka111> the wude lore is deep and convoluted
[1:41:14] <DSD24> That whiff was Wude
[1:41:17] <velgaduere> charged stabs are extremely wude
[1:41:18] <MadBaller123> Which Kirby game had the first wude appearance?
[1:41:23] <+crybirb> They could've just give you points that you can spec and respec like a normal game. Really weird way to do progression.

[1:43:21] <+Fabpsi_> you are waiting in your room with  bats and knifes in your hand, talking to your friends. Suddenly a young lady opens the door. She has a light-bulb in her hand. Everyone starts sweating...1 faints and another 1 screams

[1:43:44] <Pookiedaexzile> Instant Kill with the knife
[1:43:44] <user_naim> the foresight required to dodge knives kicked at you is immense
[1:43:51] <user_naim> these enemies are so cool
[1:43:52] <+JustToWatch> running through glass plating is incredibly satisfying
[1:43:53] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1495994438551851008?t=MtwwBoXiBdU6LlIYk0i-Kw&s=19

[1:44:54] <+Fabpsi_> oh no, she mastered the wude staff way!
[1:44:56] <+cubbywolf> hard to think after you get bonked in the head
[1:44:59] <%Gruhunchously> Off, denied
[1:45:00] <mrtanaka111> what a horrendous hair style
[1:45:09] <velgaduere> nice
[1:45:11] <+Jiggisnipe> wude
[1:45:11] <+TopTieramisu> STAB
[1:45:12] <+cubbywolf> you can parry the 3rd hit of that combo for a return
[1:45:18] <+JustToWatch> JUST TAKING A NAP
[1:45:18] <DSD24> @mrtanaka111 I think the blue part is a hat shes wearing
[1:45:20] <+TheFrancix> WUDE STAB
[1:45:25] <%Gruhunchously> Poke out her eye then knife her in the gut. VERY WUDE
[1:45:28] <%baka_sugoi> wude
[1:45:28] <velgaduere> stab-de
[1:45:29] <brunoberserk> bling + stab , the WUDE WHY
[1:45:30] <user_naim> ‚ÄùI will stab you‚Äù
[1:45:33] <DSD24> She has white hair underneath
[1:45:39] <MadBaller123> Its not a kill if you yell wude afterwards
[1:45:41] <$thotbane> why is everyone saying wude
[1:45:43] <+Fabpsi_> "what are you gonna do, stab me?" - Person who got stabbed
[1:45:43] <jubejube56> I can feel the wude envelop me
[1:45:43] <+skyshinecrusader> Wude girl
[1:45:47] <alroy909> use the wude-knife way... were you show that you can shove it in your enemy, but decide not to-fuck it shove it in anyway
[1:45:51] <mrtanaka111> IM GONNA WUDE
[1:45:54] <+crewmate> I wanted the staff in Absolver
[1:45:58] <+TopTieramisu> fk going to that exhibit area
[1:46:00] <radiorosewater> it's a wude salad
[1:46:02] <radiorosewater> wode
[1:46:03] <+Fabpsi_> the door?
[1:46:04] <radiorosewater> wade
[1:46:06] <radiorosewater> wede
[1:46:09] <user_naim> @thotbane the game tells you about martial virtue as a hint for the true ending
[1:46:12] <velgaduere> w i d e
[1:46:12] <Pookiedaexzile> Wudussy popping
[1:46:13] <+TopTieramisu> i feel like this level will be the hardest to one try in a speedrun
[1:46:18] <bentobeatdown> W u d e k i n o
[1:46:20] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @thotbane wude was described in game as a non lethal way of fighing, but you kill alot of people
[1:46:20] <+cubbywolf> skips the best part of the level, but also the hardest
[1:46:21] <%badguy8312> wonder how hard it'd be to develop a whole new moveset, DLC worthy?
[1:46:31] <user_naim> But these tactics are not uhh virtuous
[1:46:32] <velgaduere> weapon breaks once the elevator hits the top
[1:46:42] <+TopTieramisu> @badguy8312 if they add one inch punch, i'm good
[1:46:47] <jubejube56> The rain and beyblade girls guarentee me death
[1:46:47] <+cubbywolf> age 28
[1:46:54] <slackerunchained> What if the elevator opens and there's a cleaning maid who catches you doing katas in there?
[1:46:57] <+cubbywolf> I bet he died 3x
[1:47:04] <+Ricky_Rexx> unbridled artistic rage is wude
[1:47:05] <$thotbane> @cobalt_phoenix_ Well maybe it's like training weights. Using a nonlethal technique but killing with it anyway is harder and makes you stronger
[1:47:05] <%badguy8312> someone likes kill bill
[1:47:06] <+Fabpsi_> if there ever will be a dlc i would like to know more about the father and what he all did in his past. So there could be other moves, and maybe some other weapons that also have special movesets
[1:47:06] <%Th3SmartAlec> with a steel bat that's how LUL
[1:47:11] <$thotbane> time for Lady Snowblood
[1:47:18] <+TopTieramisu> yeah, this is definitely an homage to kill bill
[1:47:19] <+cubbywolf> I swear this is a vtuber voice actor
[1:47:23] <DSD24> Now I'll be honest this is the only one where I can go "yeah sparing her is a good idea"
[1:47:27] <+SammyOVision> @thotbane Eastern philosophy about showing restraint. People are saying it ironically in light of woolie stabbing people.
[1:47:28] <velgaduere> lobosJAM
[1:47:29] <+Fabpsi_> still wish there would be a dark souls "hellloooooo" when she breaks the wood-figure
[1:47:29] <Visorak6> SourPls
[1:47:29] <%xerotwo> SourPls
[1:47:31] <$thotbane> @TopTieramisu it's an Homage to Lady Snowblood which Kill Bill also homaged
[1:47:32] <brunoberserk> '' i gonna WUDE you ''
[1:47:34] <+Ricky_Rexx> The nerve of someone who helped kill your dad to say "yeah trust me you don't actually want revenge tho"
[1:47:39] <radiorosewater> WOOLO stop tjos noiseless coughs are really aoll that which likes the way that i went the other day to understand that the wide wude wode what
[1:47:53] <+cubbywolf> you dont want revenge, now that i have gotten my revenge
[1:47:58] <+TopTieramisu> @TopTieramisu i learned something new today
[1:48:09] <%Th3SmartAlec> Damn he doing it
[1:48:11] <hellhound123123> Yoooooo
[1:48:11] <kkulf_kkulf> revenge of the sifu
[1:48:17] <+Fabpsi_> matrix ain't shit against that dodge
[1:48:20] <%cobalt_phoenix_> i genuinely think this might be the 2nd worst boss in the game, on the 1st phase at least
[1:48:22] <brunoberserk> KA KA KA KACHI DAZE
[1:48:23] <slackerunchained> "Ain't so pretty no more!"
[1:48:24] <user_naim> i see the lab has paid off
[1:48:35] <jubejube56> Very wude avoids
[1:48:40] <QueequegTheater> I still can't beat her below 31
[1:48:42] <%badguy8312> how long until this game is available as a DS3 mod I wonder
[1:48:48] <+cubbywolf> 1 death
[1:48:52] <user_naim> @cobalt_phoenix_ i love it, but boy can it be tough if you go in
[1:48:56] <+TopTieramisu> god this first phase is so hard to on death
[1:48:59] <+TopTieramisu> for me
[1:49:00] <QueequegTheater> @badguy8312 Someone already modded Dante into it
[1:49:04] <+TopTieramisu> no death*
[1:49:05] <$thotbane> @badguy8312 can you mod posture into DS3
[1:49:19] <jubejube56> Funnily enough I can do this fight deathless but I still can‚Äôt do the rain part consistently
[1:49:20] <radiorosewater> for kuroki ya want to avoid the high deck which i built a couple months spent in the winter away from any place that seemed like it had that kinda vibe ya know?
[1:49:21] <+TH3BACKLOG> he actually doing really good
[1:49:25] <user_naim> I usually just wait outside her combo range, until i see a combo i recognize
[1:49:32] <%Gruhunchously> yow
[1:49:37] <+cubbywolf> my strategy is to stay out of her range and come in for the last attack and dodge that
[1:49:43] <QueequegTheater> Kuroki is very much the "you will learn to parry or you will suffer" boss
[1:49:44] <+TopTieramisu> @user_naim yep. and when she starts windmilling i run for the hills
[1:49:47] <+Ricky_Rexx> but they totally will tho
[1:49:51] <+cubbywolf> at least thats how i did it without dying
[1:49:53] <velgaduere> nice
[1:49:55] <QueequegTheater> Like how Sean teaches you to duck
[1:49:59] <DSD24> 2nd form is the easy but still really cool
[1:50:01] <+Javaa01> And now for the easier part
[1:50:02] <xxMylord> i just parry most of her attack and dodge the sweeps
[1:50:02] <BlackermanZX> damn woolz downloaded this one
[1:50:03] <%cobalt_phoenix_> now the easy part
[1:50:03] <%andrewofbob> @user_naim Spacing her is a lot more practical than Jingeng
[1:50:09] <+cubbywolf> the easiest boss begins
[1:50:13] <mrtanaka111> HALF JAPANE SE
[1:50:14] <+Ricky_Rexx> This girl got the symbiote
[1:50:15] <+Fabpsi_> this one is tricky to wude
[1:50:17] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ctrl+i
[1:50:18] <+TopTieramisu> this phase is so much easier
[1:50:21] <%badguy8312> SHIN HISAKO
[1:50:31] <DSD24> Plus you can catch the kunai
[1:50:32] <IzanagiNoOokami> WASH AWAY THE ANGER
[1:50:35] <QueequegTheater> See she's able to change colors because she's a hafu Kappa
[1:50:35] <user_naim> alright now wude this chip damage
[1:50:36] <+TopTieramisu> i love grabbing and throwing her kunais at her
[1:50:37] <$thotbane> where's Rom at?
[1:50:38] <+mechslayer71> you need to parry woolie
[1:50:39] <slackerunchained> "Ah. Madame Butterfly..."
[1:50:43] <%Gruhunchously> I can kill you in a hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. You're f*cking dead kiddo
[1:50:44] <%Xelhesia> yo
[1:50:44] <+Fabpsi_> throwing knifes back ain't very wude
[1:50:54] <+cubbywolf> stunned
[1:50:54] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:50:56] <CrimsonGargoyle> she got Lady Butterfly vibes
[1:50:58] <velgaduere> wu-nai
[1:51:01] <mrtanaka111> catch these wude
[1:51:05] <+TopTieramisu> @Fabpsi_ just returning lost property. very wude
[1:51:07] <Plughead_> parry those strings
[1:51:15] <DSD24> You dropped this kunai
[1:51:16] <+cubbywolf> stunned again
[1:51:19] <+aishman> Rush in
[1:51:22] <+Ricky_Rexx> This is what?
[1:51:24] <+Fabpsi_> but it deals a lot of dmg without structure increase
[1:51:26] <+cubbywolf> nice
[1:51:27] <%Gruhunchously> Did you know the W in Wude stands for Strand
[1:51:28] <%badguy8312> kunai tennis
[1:51:30] <velgaduere> can you block with a kunai tho? even if just for one hit?
[1:51:32] <+TH3BACKLOG> they on passive run?
[1:51:32] <QueequegTheater> I parry the string and dodge the jump kick, gives me a bunch of free damage
[1:51:32] <spokensun> nice
[1:51:40] <plankk56> very nice
[1:51:42] <radiorosewater> IN THE 2nd phase you should half some strawberry jam that got siezed by canadian customs a while back so its unfortnunate to fuckulation of beig little and stupid to martial arts on the structure to defeat the deafeat to go along with pakistan
[1:51:47] <+Javaa01> Yeah, just play it like it's Jetstream Sam, parry the dash in
[1:52:00] <+mechslayer71> you can parry the whole string
[1:52:00] <slackerunchained> You'd think after the fifth time she gets hit by her own kunai she'd learn..."
[1:52:09] <+cubbywolf> you take hp damage blocking that attack
[1:52:17] <+cubbywolf> thats why i dodge it
[1:52:18] <QueequegTheater> Anyone else just sort of stop using the light attacks eventually? Or is it just me
[1:52:19] <+Fabpsi_> no, she just knows she has to throw even MORE kunais to hit punchgirl
[1:52:19] <+Ricky_Rexx> Aging your body is one thing, how does the magic pendant change your outfit after a certain age?
[1:52:20] <%xerotwo> OOF
[1:52:20] <%Gruhunchously> This is the part where I kill you
[1:52:27] <$thotbane> @Ricky_Rexx magic
[1:52:27] <DSD24> @slackerunchained Cut her a break, she's trying her best
[1:52:29] <+Ricky_Rexx> or moreso why?
[1:52:31] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Ricky_Rexx magic
[1:52:37] <+Fabpsi_> the best "this is the part where i kill you"-part was for me in portal 2
[1:52:42] <+Ricky_Rexx> I guess I shouldn't have asked how, rather why
[1:52:43] <%andrewofbob> @Ricky_Rexx The sleeves grow like grass
[1:52:56] <DSD24> @Ricky_Rexx The medallion is like "You need to look cooler when you are older"
[1:52:57] <+Fabpsi_> with the chapter, the achievement, the subtitle and the ai saying the exact same thing, god good memories
[1:53:00] <+Ricky_Rexx> WUDE
[1:53:05] <DaBelovedUnderdog> I normally keep the kunai to help reduce chip damage when parrying
[1:53:18] <user_naim> @fabpsi_ that bit was a standout moment for sure
[1:53:32] <+cubbywolf> ded

[1:57:07] <jubejube56> Ik I shouldn‚Äôt route for Yang but when I think of how he has to defeat the opponent like 10 times without dying
[1:57:11] <+cubbywolf> that's just her nose chat
[1:57:12] <OblivionSword1> still wude
[1:57:12] <jubejube56> What an undersog
[1:57:17] <DSD24> Suit Lady is here!
[1:57:23] <+cubbywolf> being shoved into her brain causing instant death
[1:57:25] <+Ricky_Rexx> I wish at least a small percentage of enemies in this game just didn't know kung fu and were in fact normal people
[1:57:26] <DSD24> Look how cool she looks
[1:57:27] <+TopTieramisu> she a big lady

[1:58:02] <slackerunchained> This is just more evidence for my running theory that all Asians - regardless of profession or lifestyle - know martial arts.
[1:58:07] <SomeAsianDood> I like how they don't even try to redeem sean
[1:58:13] <%Gruhunchously> Lady, I'm just here to fix your computer

[2:03:16] <+cubbywolf> victory!
[2:03:18] <QueequegTheater> So, is the implication that in the true ending, you never killed anyone?
[2:03:20] <linSP> Do no killing, except goons
[2:03:20] <+Ricky_Rexx> ok that stab was totally not wue
[2:03:26] <+cubbywolf> that man with a stabbed gut deserved that... probably
[2:03:28] <+Ricky_Rexx> you can't argue that one
[2:03:31] <letshavecakes> Sifu does not kill
[2:03:33] <%badguy8312> Wude-tality
[2:03:35] <DSD24> @QueequegTheater I'm going to say yeah
[2:03:39] <slackerunchained> Goons aren't really 'people'.
[2:03:43] <%Gruhunchously> I already have. Repeatedly
[2:03:50] <%cobalt_phoenix_> Sifu never killed anyone
[2:03:51] <velgaduere> top floor I think
[2:03:52] <+Ricky_Rexx> The next mortal kombat better have wude-talitys
[2:03:54] <+cubbywolf> wait, your 21? you still havent beaten shawn with no deaths? sad

[2:05:06] <slackerunchained> "We just LOVE wasting ink, around here, to show off how much money we have."
[2:05:08] <velgaduere> it doesn't matter
[2:05:08] <+cubbywolf> if you arent age 20 then whats the point
[2:05:16] <+Ricky_Rexx> dude I hate how shrine upgrades work so much

[2:05:21] <+Ricky_Rexx> across multiple runs
[2:05:23] <+Ricky_Rexx> and timelines
[2:05:25] <velgaduere> as long as you leave instead of beat the boss you should be fine, right?
[2:05:30] <+rafaelba93> you can do it just fine
[2:05:38] <+cubbywolf> if you locked it in at 20 with a new run you'll be fine
[2:05:43] <%Th3SmartAlec> @cubbywolf yep. stupid that New Game is the only solution
[2:05:47] <user_naim> The flow of time is convoluted in China

[2:09:42] <mrtanaka111> father made her kill her sister
[2:09:43] <BlackermanZX> cue the naruto flute and swing shot
[2:09:45] <%andrewofbob> On phase 2, she said "You should have left when she gave you the chance"
[2:09:51] <+Ricky_Rexx> @SammyOVision we all know how that feels...
[2:09:56] <+Ricky_Rexx> did you spare old lady yet?
[2:10:04] <jubejube56> We must become the iceberg‚Ä¶or something
[2:10:05] <%badguy8312> she kirbied her sister and gained the power of "homicide"
[2:10:05] <$thotbane> @Ricky_Rexx I saw Malignant in 2 sittings. I texted my friend "watching  Malignant, its not very good." Next day I finished it and texted back apologizing and insisting they watch it
[2:10:06] <dds333a> Jin feng is next
[2:10:07] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Ricky_Rexx not yet
[2:10:08] <%Gruhunchously> That would be sick

[2:11:13] <+Ricky_Rexx> off the cuff leads to scuff
[2:11:23] <+cubbywolf> do it perfect the 1st time
[2:11:24] <Jaysky> I thought we find Mew under the bed?
[2:11:34] <%jepupu> Funny that sparing is a thing after you kill so many henchmen
[2:11:34] <+Fabpsi_> you could just use the elevator
[2:11:34] <+cubbywolf> nice
[2:11:35] <+Javaa01> @WoolieVersus The biggest thing to watch out with this boss is that she is brittle as hell, so you have a very limited amount of structure you can burn through sheer damage
[2:11:39] <+Axellogic> Woolie off the cuff gets put on tiktok tho
[2:11:40] <+Ricky_Rexx> @radiorosewater she'll have a body, you wanna punch it

[2:12:41] <velgaduere> damn Reggie that's mean
[2:12:41] <dds333a> @slackerunchained DOH
[2:12:42] <%cobalt_phoenix_> wait if you're gonna skip the level why bother fighting these guys
[2:12:45] <%Lion_kun> Why does Woolie wanna refight the boss
[2:12:47] <mrtanaka111> look at all this wudeless opulence
[2:12:53] <velgaduere> @Lion_kun he needs to spare her

[2:12:55] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Lion_kun wude
[2:12:55] <+TopTieramisu> that big lady's ai is... interesting. she has a tendency to run away
[2:12:58] <velgaduere> that's what this whole run is about
[2:13:04] <jubejube56> You gotta fight in the lobby, you need to EARN that elevator
[2:13:06] <+Ricky_Rexx> Wait this building is officially in universe just called "The Tower?"
[2:13:11] <+Jiggisnipe> what if she grabbed a gun
[2:13:12] <%Lion_kun> Oh sorry thought he was in the museum
[2:13:14] <+Xx_HD_xX> "Damn I meant to take the elevator the dermatologist not the gastrologist!"

[2:13:21] <+cubbywolf> very wude
[2:13:22] <letshavecakes> Honestly, if you're not taunting and going for max score, this entire fight is a complete waste of time
[2:13:24] <user_naim> @ricky_rexx maybe that‚Äôs how it works in china?
[2:13:25] <slackerunchained> What's the company's motto, there?
[2:13:25] <jubejube56> The club was called ‚Äúthe club‚Äù too
[2:13:28] <+gitgouda> when the hand poke sends someone flying
[2:13:29] <%Gruhunchously> Why is this one lady so much tougher than the rest?
[2:13:29] <%Th3SmartAlec> so I see Woolie has chosen viol- I mean wude
[2:13:32] <+Ricky_Rexx> @Jiggisnipe that's your reward for beating full wude run /s

[2:13:44] <dds333a> shortcut time
[2:13:50] <five_foo> For how tall it is I thought it was a space elevator.
[2:14:05] <+cubbywolf> oh the throw
[2:14:09] <user_naim> The chasing strikes still work on throws
[2:14:10] <OblivionSword1> yeah the chasing followup only apply to the push
[2:14:18] <+TopTieramisu> this boss' 2nd phase has the coolest stage
[2:14:20] <slackerunchained> Somehow we've wandered into the universe of Code Vein.
[2:14:21] <%Th3SmartAlec> not gonna fall down to save time Kappa
[2:14:23] <OblivionSword1> not throw

[2:14:51] <+Xx_HD_xX> @slackerunchained From dues ex to Code Vein
[2:14:58] <%Th3SmartAlec> The entire stage is throwing Pocket Sand into the screen
[2:15:02] <five_foo> They have Easter Ruins floor. Like that one episode from Phineas and Ferb
[2:15:20] <+Javaa01> Your age really doesn't matter on this run
[2:15:25] <%Gruhunchously> That looks painful
[2:15:26] <bentobeatdown> only if you're aiming for the 25 and under trophy
[2:15:26] <%Xelhesia> yea that was the camera's fault there
[2:15:27] <Pookiedaexzile> It matters to us
[2:15:32] <brexdq> we fightin ninjas now?
[2:15:39] <%Th3SmartAlec> stabby time
[2:15:42] <QueequegTheater> If you're going for the true ending age doesn't matter

[2:15:57] <%Gruhunchously> Classic Indiana Jones moment

[2:15:59] <+TopTieramisu> she's channeling her inner hayabusa
[2:16:00] <NoHeroJoe> never saw it coming
[2:16:05] <+MildConviction> Essence of Wude
[2:16:06] <+Ricky_Rexx> That was so beautifully timed
[2:16:08] <radiorosewater> Yang is actually headache inducing for a true ending run
[2:16:10] <QueequegTheater> @DSD24 "but immortality tho"
[2:16:11] <velgaduere> no, not "what the", it's "wude"
[2:16:12] <%Xelhesia> LUL
[2:16:13] <%baka_sugoi> wude
[2:16:13] <%Gruhunchously> HOLY SHIT SHE HAS A KNIFE?

[2:16:32] <slackerunchained> "Who's hiding?"
[2:16:33] <jubejube56> Lol I like how quickly woolie goes from murder to ‚Äúhmm now let me check my wude skill tree‚Äù
[2:16:33] <%Charronia> A villain monologue is a free hit limesKnife
[2:16:36] <%Th3SmartAlec> Oh this fucking room
[2:16:39] <%Gruhunchously> ow
[2:16:44] <+TopTieramisu> i was a little disappointed that you don't fight the final boss in your own dojo

[2:16:55] <+cubbywolf> LUL
[2:16:56] <%Th3SmartAlec> nice

[2:17:38] <+Ricky_Rexx> Oi bruv, you wude?

[2:17:41] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @dds333a
[2:17:48] <NBUsagi> Yo we Battle Construction Vehicles?

[2:18:49] <dds333a> nope
[2:18:50] <velgaduere> nope
[2:18:54] <jubejube56> Somebody shoulda sent a memo that having knives on premises doesn‚Äôt work out vs the protag
[2:18:54] <brexdq> mini sean

[2:19:52] <slackerunchained> "Sifu has never killed anybody."
[2:19:53] <QueequegTheater> ironmouseAYAYA
[2:19:55] <%Gruhunchously> WUDE
[2:19:57] <+Ricky_Rexx> if you get to the bottom fast enough you can see him hit the ground
[2:19:58] <%TheSaltminer> THAT'S EXTRA WUDE
[2:20:05] <+TopTieramisu> this is sifu's new londo moment
[2:20:07] <+Javaa01> Sifu Dad is smiling in the heavens for how Wude that was
[2:20:09] <DSD24> Gravity killed him
[2:20:09] <$hattrick61> "No villains, i am better than you."
[2:20:10] <%Gruhunchously> Fall Damage is Non-Canon
[2:20:17] <+MildConviction> it's wude because technically it's the fall killed her
[2:20:17] <%cobalt_phoenix_> i really wanna see a Sifu x Kiryu crossover
[2:20:18] <brexdq> spare all enemies except for that guy fuck him
[2:20:24] <user_naim> Send Jinfeng a message
[2:20:26] <DSD24> Jane Sifu is a big Hero
[2:20:27] <jubejube56> Though tbf jinfeng probably can save them from falling to their death
[2:20:28] <+MildConviction> it's wude because technically it's the fall that killed her
[2:20:28] <dds333a> Pops Sifu : " kill them all, kid"
[2:20:29] <linSP> The earth killed them
[2:20:30] <QueequegTheater> You didn't kill him, gravity did
[2:20:35] <velgaduere> wude physics
[2:20:37] <%DashXero> That's good to know.
[2:20:38] <jackedup92> invisible wude
[2:20:38] <+Axellogic> Just like in Nioh!
[2:20:40] <OblivionSword1> good to know
[2:20:40] <slackerunchained> Can't accidentally combo yourself to death. Nice. :P
[2:20:41] <NBUsagi> thats good design honestly
[2:20:46] <+TopTieramisu> it's qi levitation
[2:20:49] <user_naim> ‚ÄùJane Sifu never killed anyone‚Äù
[2:20:52] <%xerotwo> LUL
[2:20:53] <velgaduere> allow more COURAGE
[2:20:55] <+cubbywolf> METALLICA YEAH
[2:21:04] <DSD24> Jing Feng pretty cool looking tho
[2:21:04] <+cubbywolf> oh its some old lady
[2:21:08] <+Dova573> Mgr ost starts playing
[2:21:10] <DSD24> She got the old lady style
[2:21:17] <+Xx_HD_xX> "for whom does the bell toll?" For that guy that fell
[2:21:20] <dds333a> Jin Feng is not only awesome, she has an awesome fight
[2:21:39] <+cubbywolf> I like her face when you beat her though, she looks pretty scared to die
[2:21:42] <DSD24> Lady Wing Chung
[2:21:45] <+Ricky_Rexx> You can phrase it however you want, clearly yang just wanted power
[2:21:47] <user_naim> I kind of want them to make her harder, but I guess that‚Äôs what the difficulty modes will be for
[2:21:49] <velgaduere> she has very low HP though, so good luck
[2:21:52] <spokensun> high high low
[2:21:53] <NBUsagi> John Woolie in the house
[2:21:57] <+sevorai> i like how you can grab her chain thingy
[2:21:57] <jubejube56> I just wish she was a bit trickier
[2:21:57] <DSD24> Yang also keeps talking shit the entire time
[2:21:58] <letshavecakes> Third attack is always a sweep, she can do it earlier, but never more than 3
[2:22:01] <+Javaa01> Yeah notice how those 5 hits were 25% of her HP
[2:22:02] <dds333a> @cubbywolf indeed, as you'd expect
[2:22:11] <slackerunchained> @velgaduere ...Cuz she's OLD.
[2:22:11] <jubejube56> A lot of her strings are easy to catch on to and she is so weak in defence
[2:22:12] <DSD24> He really doesn't come off as moral
[2:22:17] <+Javaa01> You can't go punching her in the 2nd phase because of that
[2:22:17] <+Ricky_Rexx> Surprisingly, the one armed old woman has poor health
[2:22:20] <+TopTieramisu> nice
[2:22:21] <velgaduere> @slackerunchained yes that's correct
[2:22:26] <%Gruhunchously> Her structure regenerates, but her health is low
[2:22:33] <FloatYourGoat> frail old lady
[2:22:35] <+TopTieramisu> here we go. Bayonetta stage

[2:23:23] <user_naim> Howie Lee did a great job on this, along with the others involved
[2:23:23] <lazysaiyajin> schooled
[2:23:30] <%Gruhunchously> SO what's her element supposed to be? Air? or metal?
[2:23:35] <SomeAsianDood> Metal
[2:23:35] <dds333a> the latter
[2:23:36] <%KetsuoTaberu> metal
[2:23:37] <velgaduere> @Gruhunchously metal
[2:23:37] <$StaceMcGate> Metal
[2:23:38] <OblivionSword1> metal probably
[2:23:38] <NBUsagi> Metal or earth
[2:23:43] <dds333a> @gruhunchously you got it
[2:23:43] <+Javaa01> Metal, cause of the bell
[2:23:49] <+TopTieramisu> definitely metal
[2:23:50] <letshavecakes> The difference in structure vs. health makes the earlier bosses so much harder than the later ones if you're going for spare
[2:23:51] <%andrewofbob> Air isn't an eastern element
[2:23:52] <QueequegTheater> @NBUsagi Metal, botanist is earth
[2:23:54] <+cubbywolf> no woolie, you dodge the attacks
[2:23:55] <+skyshinecrusader> punnch this old lady in the cooter
[2:23:57] <slackerunchained> Someone should just make a mod for this boss where's she's simply half-senile and asking questions like "Where's my mashed peas?" and... "Why don't my grandchildren come to visit me, anymore?"
[2:23:58] <dds333a> Air isn't a traditional Chinese element anyway
[2:24:00] <+TheFrancix> oof
[2:24:01] <+Byr0nX> ouch
[2:24:01] <+Ricky_Rexx> You gonna be her age by the time you spare her
[2:24:03] <+AngelYoumou> I think this boss follows the rules of the age system: she's old, so she had low HP but higher offensive capabilities...in this case, range
[2:24:05] <NBUsagi> @NBUsagi i thought the botanist was wood? 0w 0
[2:24:05] <OblivionSword1> earth would be the tutorial stage I think
[2:24:05] <%xerotwo> Aight labbing time
[2:24:09] <niffinbox> gotta get your dodges down
[2:24:12] <user_naim> @queequegtheater or wood actually
[2:24:12] <+Jiggisnipe> @QueequegTheater wouldn't he be wood?
[2:24:16] <OblivionSword1> Fajar is wood that's for sure
[2:24:17] <+Ricky_Rexx> quick get the lab sign out
[2:24:21] <$thotbane> @Gruhunchously the 5th element. Boron.
[2:24:22] <NBUsagi> arnt the traditonal elements for asian culture like wood, fire, water, earth, and metal?
[2:24:28] <dds333a> Fajar is wood, and earth is yet to come
[2:24:29] <QueequegTheater> Wood is earth
[2:24:35] <%andrewofbob> @NBUsagi Yes
[2:24:35] <+Jiggisnipe> it is not
[2:24:42] <+Jiggisnipe> there are 5 elements
[2:24:42] <dds333a> Wood and Earth are distincr
[2:24:43] <niffinbox> you can parry everything she throws at you
[2:24:44] <velgaduere> she knows PogBones
[2:24:46] <bakkatohri> Wood is 8=D
[2:24:49] <velgaduere> uh oh
[2:24:50] <FloatYourGoat> easy
[2:24:50] <velgaduere> HP
[2:24:57] <+Ricky_Rexx> uhhh health low
[2:24:58] <velgaduere> HP doko
[2:24:59] <OblivionSword1> careful
[2:25:04] <QueequegTheater> Wood is just sharp earth smh

[2:36:18] <jubejube56> The thing about focus is that you can fully invest in it and still grab most structure upgrades anyways
[2:36:20] <+cubbywolf> I thought he was going to go through the whole level though
[2:36:25] <jubejube56> There are 15 shrines after all
[2:36:27] <dds333a> He just goes
[2:36:32] <lazysaiyajin> OUCH
[2:36:38] <+TopTieramisu> i hate that move
[2:36:38] <user_naim> In fact buying focus for fun is exactly what i hoped woolie would do
[2:36:39] <OblivionSword1> right in the thigh
[2:36:44] <%CavemanInCave> LUL
[2:36:44] <+cubbywolf> cant parry the grab either
[2:36:50] <+TopTieramisu> mma, the counter to kung fu
[2:36:50] <QueequegTheater> I save that knife for the staff guy
[2:36:53] <%andrewofbob> Grab on hit?
[2:36:54] <+cubbywolf> i always try to parry their grab
[2:36:56] <dds333a> the grab spam when he starts dying too, be careful LUL
[2:37:03] <jubejube56> And then level 2 focus moves are basically like charged knifes on demand
[2:37:13] <niffinbox> enemy type is called bodyguard
[2:37:25] <user_naim> So is this guy alex? or laura?
[2:37:36] <dds333a> @user_naim OOH RAH
[2:37:58] <%Gruhunchously> Brick LUL
[2:38:02] <+Axellogic> Like batman!
[2:38:05] <letshavecakes> Focus is probably the worst element of the combat system, there's very little incentive to invest in it compared to just using the default one bar eye strike
[2:38:16] <+cubbywolf> LUL
[2:38:21] <DSD24> Eye strike is also top tier
[2:38:22] <+cubbywolf> should have spammed the eye gouge
[2:38:31] <dds333a> LUL LUL
[2:38:35] <+cubbywolf> one or the other
[2:38:35] <%Gruhunchously> She did, in fact, want some more
[2:38:44] <SomeAsianDood> she infact had more
[2:38:45] <%andrewofbob> Earn more while 1 is ready
[2:38:50] <DSD24> Looking good
[2:38:52] <+cubbywolf> I found double focus wasnt that great
[2:38:54] <niffinbox> theyre ass
[2:38:57] <+cubbywolf> the double focus moves*
[2:39:01] <+cubbywolf> just use the eye gouge 2x
[2:39:03] <%Gruhunchously> Hey it's this guy
[2:39:04] <dds333a> you'd think Kappa
[2:39:05] <%Deasmeister> They're kinda eh
[2:39:07] <Jaysky> @letshavecakes I guess you need to instead FOCUS on your training
[2:39:08] <user_naim> They‚Äôre kind of okay
[2:39:12] <DSD24> You would think
[2:39:16] <user_naim> double sweeping is pretty good tho
[2:39:17] <+MildConviction> double focus sucks, like most moves and shrine buffs. it's the game's biggest weakness.
[2:39:21] <jubejube56> See I think double focus moves are great, vert strikes can let you basically put right kill things
[2:39:22] <+TopTieramisu> this guy just chillin
[2:39:22] <letshavecakes> @Jaysky how about you focus on some bitches
[2:39:22] <%andrewofbob> Worst kind of bug to hunt is an inconsistent one
[2:39:22] <dds333a> was it the spot maybe?
[2:39:26] <+cubbywolf> so metaphorical
[2:39:33] <%AyotoCorp> The best focus moves are literally eye gouge, sweep, and calbot
[2:39:36] <dds333a> Seems non-reproducible
[2:39:39] <DSD24> The knife move isn‚Äôt very good
[2:39:42] <QueequegTheater> now kill him
[2:39:43] <velgaduere> "do you get it?"
[2:39:46] <%AyotoCorp> I think the 360 staff one is halfway decent but it's 3 bars
[2:39:49] <+cubbywolf> he's just a bystander who goes down in one hit
[2:39:51] <DSD24> What a nice man
[2:39:58] <Jaysky> @letshavecakes I'm focusing on the mc though
[2:39:59] <velgaduere> WHOA

[2:40:14] <letshavecakes> @AyotoCorp sweep is worthless since you can just hit them across the face and then do the normal default sweep for free anyway
[2:40:15] <+MildConviction> ESSENCE OF WUDE
[2:40:16] <+cubbywolf> that explains why there's 2 prompts for it

[2:40:52] <user_naim> pretty okay
[2:40:52] <DSD24> All Yang does is talk shit
[2:40:55] <+mechslayer71> PAIR E
[2:40:58] <+sevorai> Rapid punches was doing work phase 1 for sure
[2:41:03] <letshavecakes> Just keep doing the same shit, and try to parry more instead of being a coward
[2:41:08] <+mechslayer71> this opening theme is sick btw
[2:41:20] <user_naim> @letshavecakes cowardice is pretty effective tho
[2:41:24] <velgaduere> crunch
[2:41:25] <slackerunchained> Kill the bird just to show how evil you are.
[2:41:27] <user_naim> gets your structure back
[2:41:27] <+SammyOVision> C r o n c h
[2:41:28] <+cubbywolf> we were family, until i got expelled for a decade and came back and murdered both you and our father
[2:41:31] <QueequegTheater> D:
[2:41:33] <DSD24> Yang is such a dick
[2:41:39] <slackerunchained> DAT BOID WAS JAHNTRAHN!
[2:41:39] <OblivionSword1> the bird's fine
[2:41:41] <+Jiggisnipe> ah
[2:41:42] <+cubbywolf> Yang is just a bitch who cant take anything
[2:41:43] <%baka_sugoi> life
[2:41:43] <+Dova573> Standing here I REALIZE
[2:41:48] <%baka_sugoi> MAGIC
[2:41:49] <velgaduere> Yang is just Anakin
[2:41:49] <ThatVisorGuy> that birb got bodied.
[2:41:51] <user_naim> that bird is cinnamon toast
[2:41:53] <+skyshinecrusader> Yes explicitly
[2:41:53] <Dakuu75> that's fake. I've seen that bird trick in real life
[2:41:53] <dds333a> no, Yang, you cannot
[2:41:54] <SomeAsianDood> literally yes
[2:41:56] <letshavecakes> Yeah pretty much
[2:42:03] <+cubbywolf> how can you say family is everything if this is your sister you murdered
[2:42:17] <DSD24> He also talks shit the entire time
[2:42:27] <dds333a> dodge hype
[2:42:34] <+cubbywolf> i love how his moveset is the same as yours, but better
[2:42:36] <DSD24> This theme is great though
[2:42:41] <letshavecakes> dodge is not hype
[2:42:52] <+TopTieramisu> this guy taunts you after 1 death. what a jerk
[2:42:53] <dds333a> dodge is SUPER hype
[2:43:02] <%baka_sugoi> THE HYPEST
[2:43:07] <letshavecakes> parry is hype, dodge is baby tier
[2:43:09] <QueequegTheater> Dodge has never built structure
[2:43:11] <+MildConviction> dodge objectively looks cool
[2:43:12] <slackerunchained> @Dakuu75 I remember them showing off the bird-trick in the film 'The Prestige' and the little kid was like "Wow! that's amazing!" and then, later, the magician was shown disposing of all the dead, crushed doves hidden in the compartment under the cage...
[2:43:15] <%Th3SmartAlec> "git gud"
[2:43:16] <user_naim> @dds333a i agree with this
[2:43:18] <+cubbywolf> well MAYBE IF I HAD AN ALIVE DAD IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EASIER YANG!
[2:43:29] <+Dova573> Dodge is to retore your structure
[2:43:31] <+gatdragon> man i missed a lot, now the main characters a woman LUL
[2:43:32] <%Gruhunchously> Dude, you had b=my throat slashed when I was 12
[2:43:33] <dds333a> Dodge is the HYPEST SHIT
[2:43:43] <+TopTieramisu> dodging the flurry is dope
[2:43:46] <+cubbywolf> dodge is to restore structure and slow down time so why even parry
[2:43:47] <dds333a> @gatdragon LUL
[2:43:48] <Dakuu75> @slackerunchained trauma unlocked
[2:43:58] <+TopTieramisu> parry to reduce his structure
[2:44:08] <DSD24> Beating this game under 25 is tough
[2:44:09] <+cubbywolf> shut up keanu
[2:44:15] <user_naim> ‚ÄùI bet sifu didn‚Äôt teach you this one‚Äù as yang pulls you into a frankensteiner
[2:44:23] <+cubbywolf> if you could use focus on yang it would be easy af
[2:44:31] <+Dova573> man imagine bosses regaining structure when they dodge
[2:44:32] <+TopTieramisu> @user_naim it's funny because that's one of the most telegraphed moves to abuse
[2:44:35] <%Gruhunchously> Oh hey, I see WUDE on the floor
[2:44:41] <%xerotwo> ZOOOOOM
[2:44:42] <Jaysky> Final stage Yang going to pull out an RKO
[2:44:43] <dds333a> @user_naim never saw this move, eh "rolling DDT"
[2:44:47] <+cubbywolf> his 2 strike that dizzy's you is so unfair
[2:44:56] <QueequegTheater> @cubbywolf Then make him tougher
[2:44:59] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[2:45:01] <velgaduere> sure are
[2:45:01] <user_naim> @toptieramisu yeah it‚Äôs so funny
[2:45:04] <%RyTYoung> There‚Äôs a Wude on the danceflooooor SingsMic woolieGASM
[2:45:07] <dds333a> so he's Iron Fist?
[2:45:12] <+RealThiele> yea just making him focus immune is a lame copout
[2:45:14] <+Parrish_broadnax> His Hands are Lethal
[2:45:20] <%Th3SmartAlec> He's built different
[2:45:21] <slackerunchained> Also HIS LEGS GLOW RED.
[2:45:24] <DSD24> That‚Äôs makes it ok though says Yang
[2:45:24] <user_naim> @dds333a i‚Äôd buy the extended yang dlc
[2:45:25] <niffinbox> those are deflects not parries
[2:45:34] <letshavecakes> If they were weapons, they would be doing chip damage while you sit there blocking attacks like an idiot
[2:45:36] <+jaguarkek318> hands registered as lethal weapons B)
[2:45:46] <+MildConviction> "I bet sifu didn't teach you this one." *pulls out gun*
[2:45:49] <velgaduere> @letshavecakes some of his attacks to chip even if you dodge them
[2:45:49] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[2:45:51] <+cubbywolf> DO IT
[2:45:52] <dds333a> LUL LUL the line
[2:45:54] <velgaduere> *do
[2:45:56] <Dakuu75> lol
[2:45:57] <%RyTYoung> @mildconviction PUH LUL LUL LUL
[2:46:01] <%Gruhunchously> @RealThiele I feel it would have been better if you could still use focus on him, but with different effects. Like he recovers faster or takes less damage or something
[2:46:03] <velgaduere> NO HE DON'T REGGIE
[2:46:05] <DSD24> We are getting close to the better look
[2:46:07] <+cubbywolf> dont look at reggie woolie, you got hit!
[2:46:09] <%AngryAsian5> woolieFROG woolieFROG woolieFROG woolieFROG woolieFROG woolieFROG
[2:46:09] <user_naim> LUL

[2:46:28] <%Th3SmartAlec> No, you
[2:46:29] <DSD24> What a hero
[2:46:31] <@Solidus_113> no u
[2:46:35] <dds333a> LUL
[2:46:38] <+TopTieramisu> that would be dope
[2:46:40] <+jaguarkek318> reverse uno
[2:46:41] <+cubbywolf> I wonder if woolie will get a game over here
[2:46:42] <velgaduere> "I'm going to take your bending away, Yang!"
[2:46:47] <+TopTieramisu> controlling the final boss at the very end would be a cool twist
[2:46:48] <%Gruhunchously> The Last of Us 2
[2:47:00] <letshavecakes> I've played a game that switched control to the final boss in the last fight, it was sick
[2:47:03] <DSD24> Bet Sifu didn‚Äôt teach you this!
[2:47:10] <+TopTieramisu> survive as the final boss so the main character can achieve wude
[2:47:10] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:47:12] <+mechslayer71> it will, a bit
[2:47:14] <%Th3SmartAlec> @toptieramisu and the better your age the more difficult the boss
[2:47:16] <%baka_sugoi> ye
[2:47:16] <+jaguarkek318> not shirtless in the rain :(
[2:47:16] <Plughead_> heavy though
[2:47:19] <+cubbywolf> i dont think so, even parry will increase it a bit
[2:47:20] <dds333a> @toptieramisu there is a game that has done this, but only if the protag loses, but I dont remember the name
[2:47:26] <Plughead_> it's a glowy attack
[2:47:32] <DSD24> Yay we got the cool jacket now
[2:47:35] <+rafaelba93> you take structure dmg by parryng
[2:47:36] <%Gruhunchously> Frankly, the fact they aren't shirtless is dissapointing
[2:47:39] <DSD24> Drip obtained
[2:47:39] <user_naim> ‚ÄùI bet sifu didn‚Äôt teach you this one‚Äù You‚Äôve done that three times Yang!
[2:47:45] <OblivionSword1> it's tricky
[2:47:46] <%Deasmeister> Your structure goes up but never break on a successful parry
[2:47:49] <+MildConviction> two siblings. fighting shirtless in the rain.
[2:47:53] <dds333a> @gruhunchously FOOLISHNESS
[2:47:57] <Dakuu75> just start throwing some random shit and see waht sticks, eh
[2:47:59] <+TopTieramisu> @user_naim you don't understand. he's teaching you the move now so you can punish it
[2:47:59] <slackerunchained> Suddenly Yang pauses the game and advances the system time by a month so you die of old age. :(
[2:48:00] <DSD24> People modded in that move for the player character btw
[2:48:16] <jubejube56> I mean I‚Äôm pretty sure I just fought Yang normally and was able to get the spare
[2:48:19] <user_naim> @toptieramisu i mean that is true. just like how sifu does it in the intro
[2:48:23] <Carlioo> woooooow yang
[2:48:31] <jubejube56> He is bulky enough that you don‚Äôt have to go fuuuull parry
[2:48:38] <dds333a> @slackerunchained Yang beats you by pausing the game over and over after taking damage once :(
[2:48:41] <Carlioo> "you never worked hard when you were young. NOTHING'S CHANGED"
[2:48:43] <+TopTieramisu> i like how yang breaks the 4th wall
[2:48:44] <DXLelouch24> Yang hass massive hp compared to other bosses so could hit him without worry
[2:48:48] <Estuko> Yang is so cool
[2:48:50] <+TopTieramisu> how does he know when someone's using focus anyways?
[2:48:51] <+rafaelba93> as long as you parry your structure doesnt break
[2:48:53] <Dakuu75> that round house had a lot of recovery
[2:49:01] <+Javaa01> @WoolieVersus The best way to do posture damage to Yang is to throw him into walls
[2:49:13] <DXLelouch24> @TopTieramisu he can do it too
[2:49:13] <MadBaller123> @TopTieramisu they squint their eyes really hard
[2:49:14] <DSD24> We getting cooler
[2:49:15] <user_naim> It would be funny if Calblt was the one focus move that worked on him
[2:49:15] <+Javaa01> The wall splats do very little real damage, and very high posture damage
[2:49:28] <user_naim> Calbot*
[2:49:29] <dds333a> @user_naim LUL LUL
[2:49:32] <%Gruhunchously> ow, my spine!
[2:49:35] <%andrewofbob> @TopTieramisu Eyes, facial expression, or maybe he's truly downloaded you
[2:49:37] <+TopTieramisu> @DXLelouch24 i can pull out a secret gun. doesn't mean i know when someone's gonna do the same
[2:49:55] <+RealThiele> secret tech bring gun to last boss
[2:49:55] <user_naim> @dds333a literally ‚ÄùI bet sifu didn‚Äôt teach you this one‚Äù
[2:49:57] <dds333a> wail on him LUL
[2:49:57] <velgaduere> shmove that bar
[2:50:04] <%Gruhunchously> Two more tries
[2:50:05] <+Jiggisnipe> the CEO spooked him
[2:50:09] <Jaysky> When you first beat him Woolie you got his bar to red
[2:50:15] <DSD24> Getting dicey
[2:50:16] <DXLelouch24> yang would prob Parry the bullets
[2:50:24] <%jonblnt> Spare him at 77
[2:50:27] <DXLelouch24> "Try Harder"
[2:50:45] <StebTheVee> Yang has alot of health for you to put hard punches
[2:50:48] <user_naim> I saw someone modded yang‚Äôs moves for the player, which would make this doubly funny
[2:50:57] <dds333a> LUL LUL LUL
[2:51:00] <%Gruhunchously> I used to mock the elderly. Then I joined them.
[2:51:02] <Pookiedaexzile> Is this how you wanna do it?

[2:56:22] <+Fabpsi_> wude - brick!
[2:56:25] <axebird> The animation for picking stuff up is great
[2:56:28] <kerbeepbop1> what is your worst boss to fight cause stage 1 artist is impossible not to die to
[2:56:33] <Parapattern> 100% Dick Punch Run
[2:56:39] <%Gruhunchously> Sorry, I can't hear you over the sound of my BRICK
[2:56:45] <jubejube56> I‚Äôd love it if you tried the wude stab on yang and he just countered it into death
[2:56:45] <user_naim> @kerbeepbop2 yang still gets me
[2:56:46] <Estuko> Reload your brick
[2:56:50] <dds333a> Hitmontop is out here
[2:56:56] <SomeAsianDood> @kerbeepbop2 you can parry all her moves with the bo you get from staff lady
[2:57:05] <+cubbywolf> what
[2:57:10] <SomeAsianDood> I just brute force it with the structure diff and easy win
[2:57:23] <Dakuu75> @Gruhunchously lo-fi Brick-beats to fall unconscious to~
[2:57:34] <kerbeepbop1> @SomeAsianDood didnt know that def have to try that
[2:57:40] <$thotbane> does weapon proficiency matter at all in this right
[2:57:48] <drhivesphd> doodScrub
[2:57:54] <+Javaa01> @thotbane Basically just speeds up the first phase
[2:57:56] <+Parrish_broadnax> beat the forgiveness into hi,
[2:57:58] <+Parrish_broadnax> *him
[2:58:03] <+cubbywolf> I find the staff makes it harder to fight him
[2:58:16] <user_naim> he‚Äôs got the symbol on the ground too
[2:58:19] <Dakuu75> wtf was that, a shadow counter? lol
[2:58:22] <$thotbane> what element is this guy
[2:58:22] <+Fabpsi_> that bitch-slap
[2:58:25] <drhivesphd> he has moves
[2:58:27] <dds333a> Earth
[2:58:30] <+cubbywolf> element of being a shit
[2:58:35] <Carlioo> step-in, SLAP
[2:58:35] <DSD24> @thotbane Hypocrite
[2:58:39] <+TopTieramisu> he's so rude
[2:58:49] <Dakuu75> big rude
[2:58:49] <Carlioo> why you gotta be so WUDE
[2:58:51] <+Xx_HD_xX> you mean wude
[2:58:54] <+Fabpsi_> that is probably the element "wind"? Or the element of Rude, almost wude but not quite
[2:58:58] <user_naim> Wude Boy
[2:58:59] <slackerunchained> Zone him out with some fireballs.
[2:59:00] <Visorak6> I believe he's metal if we follow the five elements
[2:59:02] <kerbeepbop1> not being able to use focus on yang def makes the fight more engaging
[2:59:07] <+cubbywolf> use your dragon punch!
[2:59:08] <%jonblnt> So is the protag‚Äôs family the metal elements user
[2:59:09] <QueequegTheater> @Visorak6 old lady is metal
[2:59:10] <SomeAsianDood> @Visorak6 no the CEO was metal
[2:59:15] <Visorak6> Then he'd be earth
[2:59:17] <DSD24> I mean doesn‚Äôt he have healing powers
[2:59:18] <Pookiedaexzile> He's not metal, He's life
[2:59:28] <SomeAsianDood> Yang is Air. Though he's a tool and calls himself "The Dawn"
[2:59:31] <Estuko> His taunting you is so mean
[2:59:34] <zanzibarian_hamster> Man he shit talks your taunts but he taunts you constantly, what a biiiitch
[2:59:39] <dds333a> He's Earth, just not overtly, symbolically
[2:59:41] <QueequegTheater> @kerbeepbop2 If you have to disable a core mechanic to make a fight fun it's a shit fight
[2:59:41] <+MildConviction> have you heard of popular 80s/90s pro wrestler with a martial arts gimmick, Rick Wude?
[2:59:43] <drhivesphd> he re.ind
[2:59:44] <+Xx_HD_xX> He's the element of surprise
[2:59:45] <+cubbywolf> wouldnt the 1st boss be earth?
[2:59:48] <+TopTieramisu> yang does have big zaheer energy
[2:59:51] <dds333a> Fajar is wood
[2:59:51] <+Jiggisnipe> Yang is probably Earth
[2:59:52] <+Parrish_broadnax> Hes an Asshole is what he is
[2:59:55] <drhivesphd> reminds me of zaheer
[2:59:56] <Visorak6> Fajar is wood
[2:59:57] <+cubbywolf> ah
[3:00:01] <+Jiggisnipe> the 5 elements are Wood, Fire, Water, Metal, Earthe
[3:00:04] <+Jiggisnipe> Earth*
[3:00:13] <user_naim> The achievements list the elements
[3:00:19] <+crybirb> Yang is Earth, it's in the achievements
[3:00:25] <DSD24> Yang you looked cooler in the prologue
[3:00:26] <Estuko> he punched your lady balls
[3:00:27] <Dakuu75> neat
[3:00:45] <QueequegTheater> @Estuko I mean, it probably still hurts
[3:00:50] <+crybirb> These are the elements of nature according to Chinese culture, not the Alchemy elements.
[3:01:00] <+Parrish_broadnax> Yang can see your body giving up on you, But can he see why kids love the sweet taste of cinnamon toast crunch?
[3:01:07] <QueequegTheater> Why would you ever use anything but heavy attacks
[3:01:08] <dds333a> especially since there are only four alchemical elements LUL
[3:01:14] <+Fetrigon> creepy49Porpkek talk to him yang
[3:01:14] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:01:29] <Supabait> he's beginning to believe
[3:01:30] <+crybirb> @dds333a, the Red Tint is the 5th element, Philosopher's Stone/Life Elements
[3:01:35] <+TheFrancix> HE'S STARTING TO BELIEVE

[3:01:49] <dds333a> @crybirb woah, is that so?
[3:01:50] <Carlioo> @Estuko reminds me of the time I accidentally hit a table football stick right onto a girl's crotch and she couldn't walk properly for the rest of the night
[3:01:57] <styptysat> Download complete
[3:02:06] <+MildConviction> @WoolieVersus for the first phase, the Triangle, pause, Triangle move kinda fucks his day up. you can do it twice in row every time you do it.
[3:02:09] <slackerunchained> @Parrish_broadnax "Does it carry the power and wisdom of the Wude?" / "Blind fool! It's because there are cinnamon-sugar swirls in every bite!"
[3:02:14] <letshavecakes> Every time he dodges to your left, he does the flurry attack. Easiest parry in the game
[3:02:16] <user_naim> @carlioo what a romeo
[3:02:17] <%TheSaltminer> the Fifth Element is Leeloo Dallas, haven't you all seen the movie???

[3:13:26] <OblivionSword1> achieve enlightenment
[3:13:26] <+JustToWatch> are you the kung-fu panda now?
[3:13:27] <+Jiggisnipe> see guys, if you don't get revenge, you die, always get revenge
[3:13:27] <velgaduere> okay but what if Yang brings you back tho
[3:13:28] <%townzzzzz> you can say this is the path of the dragoin
[3:13:28] <user_naim> I think Yang gave you the amulet back
[3:13:29] <niffinbox> send wudes
[3:13:32] <BlackermanZX> Get Into Wude Games
[3:13:36] <dds333a> I know people dislike the whole revenge trope, but I honestly do love when the protag completes their revenge, and decides not to kill them, and simply defeats them
[3:13:37] <%jinking79> Lossing Is Winning
[3:13:39] <gespenstkick> AYYY QA CREDITS
[3:13:41] <+Fetrigon> cultural review consultants. nice! SeemsGood
[3:13:44] <user_naim> @dds333a agree
[3:13:47] <Pookiedaexzile> Heart Attack at 37 what you eating
[3:13:48] <OblivionSword1> there's no spare on the third phase thankfully
[3:13:49] <DeathByPoke7> yay qa
[3:13:51] <$hattrick61> As a wise turtle said, "inner peace"
[3:13:52] <+Javaa01> There is not a Phase 3 spare
[3:13:56] <+Javaa01> Only kill
[3:13:57] <Guigondi> @WoolieVersus  i think she falling was the lasting effect of his finishing blow prior?
[3:14:00] <Gadagast> Stage 9 Ultra Wude
[3:14:00] <dds333a> Or when they deliberately let go of their revenge for the sake of someone or something else
[3:14:01] <+MildConviction> the SUPER TRUE Ending is taking control of yang in the third phase and sparing the MC
[3:14:03] <$StaceMcGate> @dds333a how many people did woolie kill to get to his targets only to spare them
[3:14:08] <Dakuu75> is something different if you beat him, younger?
[3:14:21] <$hattrick61> Super Wude God Super Wude
[3:14:22] <jubejube56> You couldn‚Äôt lose, you were too wude at that point
[3:14:25] <+Jiggisnipe> @dds333a it shows that I'm better than you, you owe me your life and you are weak. It's interesting
[3:14:28] <+Xx_HD_xX> I think it would have been cool to keep sparing him & as you keep doing it he would get weaker
[3:14:32] <dds333a> @stacemcgate you're correct but I'm referring to the the trope in general LUL
[3:14:36] <%Lion_kun> Ha you may have succeeded in killing me and avoiding justice but I get to go to dragon heaven, I am the true winner.
[3:14:40] <gespenstkick> Git Wude
[3:14:49] <+crybirb> she lost tho, to a hit of his. He didn't lose his will to fight, he just went "yo my hit lag spiked"
[3:14:50] <dds333a> examples where the protag DOESN'T brutally murder fools
[3:14:52] <Carlioo> @Lion_kun LUL
[3:14:55] <+Jiggisnipe> you found Wude
[3:14:57] <+crybirb> Their fight just didn't had rollback netcode.
[3:15:00] <velgaduere> inner peas
[3:15:03] <PunkZedB> you found inner dragon
[3:15:04] <$StaceMcGate> I dunno, I just hate abandoning revenge quests after killing so many on the way, like TLOU 2, in which at that point what the hell was the point
[3:15:05] <BlackermanZX> so do you mean you get to live with the space dragon
[3:15:05] <+mechslayer71> we found M O R T I S
[3:15:05] <yukichocomilk> wude
[3:15:06] <Who_lio42> wude dude
[3:15:09] <NBUsagi> Peace is worth more than vengeance
[3:15:10] <Dakuu75> inner wude
[3:15:13] <+Javaa01> It's all Chinese folklore stuff
[3:15:14] <Guigondi> Mortis
[3:15:20] <jubejube56> You found inner peace inside of the guts of those people you stabbed
[3:15:20] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:15:23] <dds333a> There you have it
[3:15:26] <user_naim> I think you like return the talismans or something
[3:15:30] <Dakuu75> OH the STINGER
[3:15:31] <Deko_> i lived bitch
[3:15:33] <+mechslayer71> yeah they lived
[3:15:35] <velgaduere> so he gave it back to you
[3:15:36] <OblivionSword1> one coin was used
[3:15:38] <%KetsuoTaberu> oh, he gave it back?
[3:15:39] <+TopTieramisu> you died and came back
[3:15:40] <%HeroToxiko> @lion_kun imagine getting beat so hard you die like the guy who suddenly aged in that boxing manga
[3:15:40] <$hattrick61> John Sifu Will Return
[3:15:47] <+Jiggisnipe> Yang received you maybe
[3:15:47] <Supabait> yang returned to the right path üôè
[3:15:48] <%Lion_kun> was that Yang or the protag?
[3:15:51] <MinersLoveGames> Bit of a sudden ending...
[3:15:53] <+crybirb> still kinda flat ending
[3:15:55] <Carlioo> when are we getting sif2
[3:15:56] <user_naim> Jane Sifu will continue to murder
[3:15:58] <%Deasmeister> Or was that Yang
[3:15:59] <+Javaa01> Yeah Yang gave the pendant back, but at the cost of 10 (canonical) years
[3:16:00] <+Fabpsi_> What did we learn?
[3:16:02] <NBUsagi> I mean either way both people learned something
[3:16:03] <+TopTieramisu> i wasn't a big fan of the ending
[3:16:05] <$StaceMcGate> Yang saved you apparently
[3:16:05] <+crybirb> She became Ip Man
[3:16:06] <Guigondi> Yang gave you back the medallion to ressurect you????
[3:16:08] <QueequegTheater> NEVER KILLED A SINGLE PERSON
[3:16:08] <%Lion_kun> Protag had to die to redeem a child murderer.
[3:16:12] <+RealThiele> meh ending
[3:16:17] <Deko_> the kiryu path
[3:16:19] <%Th3SmartAlec> I have that mod that turns the painting into Giga Chad and that screen is hilarious
[3:16:19] <DXLelouch24> that was girl protag
[3:16:28] <+skyshinecrusader> @Lion_kun hes also a child saver
[3:16:28] <user_naim> @th3smartalec nice
[3:16:28] <+TheFrancix> there are 3 endings so you are missing 1
[3:16:44] <+TopTieramisu> @Lion_kun tbf, plant dude killed her, not yang
[3:16:47] <%jinking79> way better than LOU2 story LUL
[3:16:54] <BlackermanZX> so this is like everhood's message Keepo
[3:16:54] <Leud_De_Grace> Taught Yang the lesson he needed, and the MC lets go to break the cycle or revenge at least
[3:16:55] <OblivionSword1> there's only 2 ending right ?
[3:16:56] <%Lion_kun> @TopTieramisu On his orders lol
[3:17:00] <%HeroToxiko> @lion_kun  he kills to save
[3:17:05] <haisho> depends on the region
[3:17:06] <Guigondi> i think that ending does leave a lot to be desired
[3:17:12] <Leud_De_Grace> Only two endings Ive heard
[3:17:17] <sagemodeanon> That's a japanese thing, where the put the chopsticks in the bowl standing up
[3:17:21] <sendart> there's only 2 endings but people clck bait with the credit screen
[3:17:23] <+OrangeMDT> Bad moral of the story. Should always kill child murderers, especially if you were the child
[3:17:24] <+crybirb> Only two endings, the "third one" is this post credits
[3:17:33] <+KisukeOboro> I think he did get the 3 endings, 1 for killing Yang, 1 for sparing him, then the last one where you spare all of the bosses
[3:17:38] <dds333a> this info board is actually the most unexpected thing of this game to me
[3:17:41] <%Lion_kun> I do really hate revenge stories where the protag spares the final bad guy despite the piles of bodies he made to get to him.
[3:17:41] <+SammyOVision> I know that there is a taboo to set rice with the chopsticks standing up, because it resembles incense at a funerary shrine
[3:17:42] <velgaduere> maybe for fully unlock everything?
[3:17:43] <gespenstkick> Pepe Silvia?!
[3:17:46] <+TopTieramisu> i was hoping that the spared bosses would factor into the ending. but it was purely a metaphorical ending without much connection to the past
[3:17:49] <+RealThiele> yang will now feel sad, you win? ignore all the murdering he did. man this is a yakuza side story
[3:17:50] <soflicar> this one is unlikely to get without a hint
[3:17:52] <+Fabpsi_> there is a little hint for that "the club" artifact. Maybe ask at the reception...
[3:17:54] <dds333a> I didn't expect the game to have this much in terms of lore
[3:17:56] <knownstabber> that is a just talk at the club
[3:18:03] <%Lion_kun> Ellie spared Abby for no reason when she already killed a bunch of people including a oregnant woman and Guy Fieri.
[3:18:06] <+crybirb> @Lion_kun, that's why John Wick 1 is a masterpiece. He doesn't even THINK twice.
[3:18:07] <plankk56> leaving the late food and stuff they like is usually the custom
[3:18:08] <%Lion_kun> pregnant*
[3:18:14] <jubejube56> Oh is that where you beat up the 2 people in the entrance then ask where yang is?
[3:18:17] <velgaduere> OH NO
[3:18:18] <+TopTieramisu> oregnant LUL
[3:18:21] <%AngryAsian5> LUL
[3:18:23] <BlackermanZX> LUL
[3:18:24] <%Gruhunchously> LUL
[3:18:26] <%Prevot> gregnant
[3:18:27] <+LoveYouCuzDrunk> Is the picture of the two tombstones new?
[3:18:30] <+TopTieramisu> pregerant
[3:18:34] <+Deosier> i think yang use the talismen to revive you after you wude all over him
[3:18:37] <user_naim> Can u get pregante
[3:18:38] <Dakuu75> pregrananant
[3:18:42] <linSP> wtf is a wude
[3:18:43] <%Double_Tap_That> Wude from what I remember translates to something like "martial morality"
[3:18:45] <brunoberserk> shenmue WISHES to be this game
[3:18:50] <%AyotoCorp> @WoolieVersus I think the last item for the club is talk to the guy at the front desk after beating up the other two guys in the room
[3:18:51] <velgaduere> @TopTieramisu I do like some oregano in my Prego
[3:18:52] <+skyshinecrusader> Its just a flex
[3:18:55] <+TopTieramisu> @linSP martial morality
[3:18:59] <Dakuu75> El preganteh~
[3:19:01] <%HeroToxiko> like the ending of shogun
[3:19:16] <+TopTieramisu> using your martial arts morally
[3:19:16] <+crybirb> Wude is a mindset man, a way of life, a lifestyle, an entire movement, moving nations and cativating the young. Follow me for more NFT tips.
[3:19:17] <%Lion_kun> @crybirb It was just a stupid do-dead
[3:19:20] <dds333a> The Shirou way LUL
[3:19:25] <%Gruhunchously> There's one final piece I think
[3:19:29] <velgaduere> babby dead
[3:19:29] <jubejube56> You showed him that you were closer to the dragon
[3:19:33] <BlackermanZX> My wude is longer than yours
[3:19:40] <user_naim> That you‚Äôre not afraid of death, not obsessed like him
[3:19:40] <Who_lio42> Wife and kid i think
[3:19:44] <jubejube56> I‚Äôve got a bigger wude
[3:19:46] <+crybirb> @Lion_kun, I wanna kill that man. I killed that man. Consequences.
[3:19:51] <Leud_De_Grace> Family
[3:19:59] <user_naim> Made by Kuroki for Yang I guess
[3:20:09] <dds333a> When he says "don't leave me", I think he's talking both to his family, and somewhat the protag
[3:20:09] <+skyshinecrusader> it says on yangs picture
[3:20:19] <%Lion_kun> See you bro, you may have killed me and my dad and who knows how many innocent people, but I get to fly a dragon!
[3:20:21] <%andrewofbob> 4 intonations
[3:20:25] <%KetsuoTaberu> 4 tones and no tone
[3:20:25] <OblivionSword1> depends on the inflection
[3:20:31] <Who_lio42> Yang wanted to save them w Sifu's power but didnt let him is my guess
[3:20:41] <CrimsonGargoyle> @Lion_kun Honestly always worth it csbeastYeyeye
[3:20:58] <OblivionSword1> mandarin is wild
[3:21:00] <gespenstkick> The poet Shishi that ate lions?
[3:21:09] <+skyshinecrusader> buffalo buffalo
[3:21:13] <+ReallyBigRocks> Apparently Perfect Pitch is more common in China because the language is dependent on pitch to convey meaning
[3:21:15] <%Lion_kun> Not those lame ass western dragons either, a cool ass eastern dragon
[3:21:15] <Kalinflip> Am I late
[3:21:22] <velgaduere> well I guess that explains why Yang's element is earth
[3:21:35] <Dakuu75> @Kalinflip he jsut got the true ending like 2 minutes ago
[3:21:41] <+ReallyBigRocks> Or rather I should say, it's more common among Mandarin speakers
[3:21:41] <dds333a> exactly, Yang represents Earth in its meaning
[3:21:41] <Kalinflip> As damn
[3:21:48] <+cubbywolf> 35
[3:21:50] <dds333a> Just not like, obviously
[3:21:50] <letshavecakes> lol
[3:21:51] <+mechslayer71> but he had a wife and child
[3:21:55] <StebTheVee> 30s
[3:21:55] <skagtheprinceofhell> I was debating if Yang or the old woman was Earth/Metal
[3:21:57] <OblivionSword1> early 30 probably
[3:21:58] <Kalinflip> Well
[3:22:00] <+rrratbastard> i wonder if yang knew fajar before the sanctuary or after
[3:22:09] <+cubbywolf> E V E R Y T H I N G
[3:22:10] <Who_lio42> where do you get that thing next to the key from the club
[3:22:11] <Kalinflip> Everything
[3:22:11] <+cubbywolf> except dragons
[3:22:12] <mihokspawn> If you wanna talk about inflection, here is some Hungarian Te tetted e tettetett tettet, te tettetett tettek tettese, te! ‚Äì You did this pretended act, you, doer of pretended acts, you!
[3:22:12] <velgaduere> @skagtheprinceofhell he represents earth because his family is in it
[3:22:28] <jubejube56> Did the world end when you completed wude?
[3:22:29] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:22:29] <+Jiggisnipe> @skagtheprinceofhell the bell seems to be her thing so she's probably metal
[3:22:30] <%TheSaltminer> You sketch things like that
[3:22:33] <xxMylord> I gues you died and go to konfu heaven and Yang brings you back with the talisman.
[3:22:35] <%Double_Tap_That> No answers, only woolieLORE
[3:22:35] <+LoveYouCuzDrunk> You murdered the world! Congrats!
[3:22:35] <jubejube56> Dragon apocalypse
[3:22:37] <%TheSaltminer> the other areas have sketched bad guys
[3:22:42] <%AyotoCorp> You've been to the mountaintop
[3:22:43] <dds333a> Also, each of the bosses represent the Chinese legendary creatures
[3:22:48] <StebTheVee> CEO looked a bi younger in the prologue, then pulled a movie Magneto age in the timeskip
[3:22:50] <+cubbywolf> i think its how many you have left cuz i had 2
[3:22:53] <+Javaa01> It's not tied to how many you had left
[3:22:53] <NBUsagi> i think in canon you only ever loose the 1 coinc
[3:22:53] <Dakuu75> Next time on Sifu Ball Z
[3:23:03] <%pi_in_the_sci> Jang repairs the talisman to save you, yes
[3:23:04] <%Gruhunchously> You out-wuded him
[3:23:07] <Pookiedaexzile> You were 37
[3:23:08] <%HeroToxiko> forgiveness?
[3:23:09] <+sevorai> yeah
[3:23:16] <letshavecakes> I want to play as Yang, with those mid-combo dashes as part of his moveset
[3:23:20] <jubejube56> It‚Äôs based on age
[3:23:20] <skagtheprinceofhell> Yeah you saw it at the end. He had his own.
[3:23:21] <knownstabber> he had that revival power shown with the bird
[3:23:24] <+cubbywolf> yang dlc when
[3:23:24] <radiorosewater> thats why only 4 of the rings are glowing
[3:23:26] <Dakuu75> that's how I choose to interpret it
[3:23:33] <+sevorai> "Damn, she out WUDE'd me, GGs"
[3:23:36] <%Gruhunchously> He has some sort of revival power with the bird
[3:23:37] <+OG_M_Bison> I think Yang appreciated that you spared him
[3:23:38] <%cobalt_phoenix_> it's too vague
[3:23:40] <velgaduere> Yang also had his own artifact, which he used for revival and restoration
[3:23:43] <+TopTieramisu> i want to learn that wall jump kick that everyone uses
[3:23:43] <+Javaa01> Yeah, you proved to him that you had learned the lesson, so he returned it to you, and it brought you back at the cost of one coin
[3:23:45] <velgaduere> the whole point of his sanctuary
[3:23:47] <dds333a> LUL LUL LUL

[3:23:55] <BlackermanZX> LUL
[3:23:57] <user_naim> The achievements refer to you getting the talismans from the baddies. I guess Yang revives you with the amulet and you uhh return the talismans to a dragon or something

[3:27:16] <%Double_Tap_That> Aren't the Furi devs also French?
[3:27:21] <dds333a> Especially somewhat intently
[3:27:26] <user_naim> @double_tap_that game bakers yeah
[3:27:34] <user_naim> they made Haven too
[3:27:47] <kerbeepbop1> the short length def helps, could've been bogged down by too many levels
[3:27:49] <%Double_Tap_That> Seems like the French know how to make tight action games.
[3:27:50] <+crybirb> @skagtheprinceofhell, but yeah. I wanted them to remake the PS1 Jackie Chan game in this game framework.
[3:27:54] <Guigondi> Poor Platinum Games.... their Sol Cresta are gonna be steam rolled by Elden Ring
[3:28:04] <skagtheprinceofhell> @crybirb Oh that be fucking sick.
[3:28:08] <dds333a> do your own reading, they're not gonna hold your hand Kappa
[3:28:31] <+FoxLex_> Who has he spared?
[3:28:34] <skagtheprinceofhell> The peaceful path is Chinese Morale Relativism.
[3:28:37] <dds333a> Everybody
[3:28:43] <dds333a> (but the mooks)
[3:28:53] <skagtheprinceofhell> @foxlex_ All of them.
[3:28:53] <user_naim> Shoutout benjamin colussi i guess
[3:29:20] <dds333a> To tie it together
[3:29:20] <skagtheprinceofhell> Honestly, can we just call it the Styling Path? It wasnt exactly peaceful.
[3:29:21] <aka_Jigawatt> is the stream over? i just got here :(
[3:29:33] <skagtheprinceofhell> @aka_jigawatt Yea wrapping up.
[3:29:33] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:29:51] <+cubbywolf> I think there needs to be more levels and a few more basic combos to truly be great
[3:29:53] <+Xx_HD_xX> The guardians & were they right?
[3:29:53] <RyuuAoi> @aka_jigawatt Sadly
[3:29:54] <%Shad0wTag> Styling Path is a dope name
[3:30:12] <skagtheprinceofhell> Did they explain where the fuck the magic came from in general or was that more just ancient Chinese myth and no need to question that?
[3:30:16] <+aishman> Pretty sure that's supposed to be Yang in the post credits
[3:30:22] <niffinbox> the dev who did the post cutscene deliberately made it to be interpreted, didnt even explain it to the other devs
[3:30:35] <%Gruhunchously> That's hilarious if true
[3:30:36] <dds333a> Especially considering Sifu McProtag is an actual character, but treated as a self insert
[3:30:36] <+aishman> As your character is in the afterlife/elightenment
[3:30:37] <+RealThiele> yea the magic is unexplained
[3:30:39] <Who_lio42> yeah i just wanna know who "sifu" is at the end
[3:31:13] <dds333a> @skagtheprinceofhell I always saw it as, the magic is literal, but what happens mid fight is metaphorical
[3:31:34] <+Javaa01> @WoolieVersus To him, you represent the mistakes he already made once
[3:31:38] <IzanagiNoOokami> STANDING HERE, I REALIZE
[3:31:56] <RyuuAoi> @who_lio42 The sifu was you. All along.
[3:31:58] <skagtheprinceofhell> I mean you say that but not even mid fight. Stuff was happening that showed more to it like space warping while your going to their boss place.
[3:32:00] <%Gruhunchously> Yeah that's sort of the theme of the 'spare' endings
[3:32:14] <mczarklesby> I think Yang resurrected you eight years ago.
[3:32:18] <+RealThiele> why does yang respect that after being such a shit the whole game
[3:32:20] <Who_lio42> @RyuuAoi :O
[3:32:27] <dds333a> @skagtheprinceofhell yeah, that too, but in most cases the level remains the way it is
[3:32:54] <skagtheprinceofhell> @realthiele Real recognize Real
[3:33:02] <RyuuAoi> Pop in some Super Smash Bros Ultimate, Woolie, and you and Reggie can fight us? All the DLC been out now
[3:33:07] <+Jiggisnipe> @RealThiele cuz you make Yang your bitch
[3:33:09] <velgaduere> age 20 run let's goooooo PogChamp
[3:33:12] <%Gruhunchously> Maybe they'll add more levels with DLC
[3:33:13] <Who_lio42> Yang wasnt that wrong because he wanted to use Sifu's familys power to save his family
[3:33:18] <dds333a> The Tower and Museum have interesting set pieces. but Squats, Club,  and Sanctuary don't change
[3:33:19] <%townzzzzz> sifu sundays
