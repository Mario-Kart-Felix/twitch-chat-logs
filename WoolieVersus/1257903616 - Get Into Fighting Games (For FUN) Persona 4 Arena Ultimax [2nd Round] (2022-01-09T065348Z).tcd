[0:06:37] <+DatAsuna> E.g. pat uses macros do cafting so he doesn't have to actually play ff14
[0:06:39] <@Menitta> There should be a gimmick Macro only tournament
[0:06:48] <+DatAsuna> yeah probably
[0:06:52] <@Solidus_113> Madkatz started bad, rose up in the FGC, then died, and started back at the bottom
[0:07:02] <+fsp64> I guess you can use online

[0:07:15] <%Shad0wTag> No one will want their sponsorship
[0:07:19] <+PMAvers> Like, I could see that being a cheap way to have a stick that you can use on multiple platforms due tot he dongle, but... yeah.

[0:11:21] <timorales43> @viredae depends, the obsidian and pearl are a bit more expensive than hori RAP4s, but the hori fighting edge is more expensive overall (from what i remember from Amazon pricings)
[0:11:41] <timorales43> they're around 150-250 bucks btw
[0:11:57] <+viredae> so no significant difference in price? thank you

[0:23:43] <%kyh9> Tanaka should be an Announcer
[0:24:01] <%kyh9> If we get another Persona Arena game, I want Persona 1 and 2 representation
[0:24:02] <%MyNameIsRasus> God I want a Persona 5 Arena so bad
[0:24:10] <+elderpunch> @kyh9 fax
[0:24:20] <%RyTYoung> this is sick, and I don't even know anything about these characters
[0:24:22] <plaguedoctor_vi> @kyh9 does he have a voice?
[0:24:23] <@Menitta> the P5 cast lends itself so well to a fighter. Moreso than the P3 and 4 cast
[0:24:25] <%kyh9> Give me Maya or give me death
[0:24:25] <@Menitta> imo
[0:24:29] <+ChillaxingJay> yeah i cant wait for p5 fighting game

[0:24:59] <@Menitta> WHOOOO
[0:25:04] <%kyh9> Good try
[0:25:05] <Buddha0991> some people want a p5a thats 3d like guilty gear but id prefer it if its still like this and all these characters are still in the game, as opposed to a probably roster refresh a 3d version would have
[0:25:15] <%kyh9> Good tryGood tryGood try
[0:25:24] <%MyNameIsRasus> no mercy in this house
[0:25:32] <%paladinstarbuster> woolie having his way with newbie Reggie for the next 30mins

[0:26:15] <%kyh9> Love rush-down grapplers
[0:26:28] <FlamingNarwhal> I 100% agree we should just get persona arena with the entire series. A Wider SMT Arena would also be fun
[0:26:29] <%townzzzzz> meat install
[0:26:42] <%kyh9> Install the Steak into Chie's stomach
[0:26:57] <+softdeadline> I'm playing P3 for the first time after playing P4A a while ago, and I'm sad that Akihiko didn't wear this fit to school everyday

[0:26:59] <blue_grave> gimme a smt fighting game. I want to play as demi fiend with the pixie assist
[0:27:07] <+ChillaxingJay> @buddha0991 i dont think atlus cares about anything before p3 at this point
[0:27:15] <%MyNameIsRasus> @softdeadline the vest does look clean tho
[0:27:22] <GodGoshDarnIt> they should make Persona Q Arena, every character from all 5 games
[0:27:22] <%townzzzzz> SMT all stars
[0:27:24] <Buddha0991> they care more than they have in ages, which is to say not much but they are actually using persona 1 and 2 in artwork again at least lol
[0:27:55] <+elderpunch> good try
[0:27:59] <+FuqBoiSlim> wdym they had the pre-p3 protags in that 25th anniversary art. they totally care *copium*

[0:34:45] <%ChillaxingJay> @dds333a i was talking about P1 and p2 specifically
[0:34:45] <TerpanderLux> chjbDance
[0:34:56] <+DatAsuna> Real good stoyr mode, the fist one at least
[0:35:01] <%RyTYoung> So P3 and P4 share characters from both games?
[0:35:12] <drunken_lemur> @RyTYoung No
[0:35:16] <%dds333a> @chillaxingjay P5 references literally every game in the series
[0:35:18] <%ChillaxingJay> @rytyoung its the same universe
[0:35:30] <Buddha0991> this fighting game is the entire cast from 4 and most of the cast from 3 + some new characters
[0:35:32] <%dds333a> All the Persona games take place across (two) universes
[0:35:37] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> man i sure am excited for atlus to celebrate smt's 30th this year by porting a bunch of p3/4/5/ crap
[0:35:42] <TerpanderLux> jermaVenus
[0:35:47] <+elderpunch> woolieSHOOKREG
[0:35:54] <+yeknomlive> low health supers fucking kill

[0:35:55] <+elderpunch> @yaboi_raidshadowlegends loool
[0:36:04] <%RyTYoung> I wish the pc port of p4 came to console
[0:36:05] <%ChillaxingJay> @dds333a really i missed those references
[0:36:07] <+elderpunch> i just want smt 1 n 2 on switch
[0:36:10] <Buddha0991> bruh smtv just came out thats the smt 30th lol
[0:36:13] <+elderpunch> and if
[0:36:21] <%Shad0wTag> P2EP, P3, P4 and P5 all happen one after another
[0:36:22] <%dds333a> They're on the tv in Leblanc yeah LUL
[0:36:41] <+yeknomlive> @elderpunch ive been dying for those. i was so bummed when if translations got canned
[0:36:50] <%ChillaxingJay> @dds333a LUL im wrong then
[0:36:54] <+elderpunch> nanako is the best character in p4
[0:36:55] <+DatAsuna> @ChillaxingJay basically smt if/P1/P2IS are one universe and then P2ES + 3/4/5 are the other
[0:36:59] <%Shad0wTag> But P5 dropped the year and made it 20XX
[0:37:19] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> don't worry we'll get a remaster of dds1 that's slightly better than nocturne's FeelsGoodMan
[0:37:19] <+elderpunch> @yeknomlive im pretty sure a fan trans is out
[0:37:21] <+DatAsuna> *EP
[0:37:26] <+elderpunch> i have it on pc
[0:37:32] <@Menitta> Isnt it funny how the success of P4G on steam led Atlus to porting P4AU to everything
[0:37:33] <wawila> @Shad0wTag I think that because of the calendar you could assume which year it was. dont though
[0:37:35] <%dds333a> @yaboi_raidshadowlegends just like the game itself LUL
[0:37:38] <@Menitta> thats funny.
[0:37:59] <%dds333a> That's Twister, yeah
[0:38:04] <+yeknomlive> @elderpunch holy shit ur right
[0:38:06] <+elderpunch> chies such a damn dweeb
[0:38:07] <Buddha0991> actually the universe split is
[0:38:08] <wawila> @Menitta I am not a big fighting game player but I am going to buy P4AU just so they keep doing PC releases
[0:38:20] <%dds333a> Akihiko is all bout AGGRESSION
[0:38:31] <Buddha0991> P1/P2IS and P1/P2EP/P3/P4/P4A/P4AU/P5/P5S
[0:38:36] <Buddha0991> persona 1 still happens in both
[0:38:36] <@Menitta> I'll buy P4AU. $30 to not have to constantly plug in my PS3
[0:38:43] <@Menitta> or 360 for that matter
[0:38:44] <Buddha0991> but the persona 2 that happens is different
[0:38:47] <zepelinnn1> when i have to shoot Chie during the cop war because ACAB rooCry
[0:38:48] <%Shad0wTag> I think its because P5 's long development made it so the year  made it too far ahead
[0:39:04] <%dds333a> @buddha0991 exactly, the difference comes down to Tsumi and Batsu
[0:39:17] <@Menitta> the calendar in P5 matches 2016 iirc
[0:39:25] <Buddha0991> also technically SMT If... and the Devil Summoner series happens right?
[0:39:37] <+elderpunch> @Buddha0991 yes
[0:39:44] <%Shad0wTag> I believe so
[0:39:45] <%dds333a> @buddha0991 they do LUL but we've been over that
[0:39:47] <wawila> @zepelinnn1 Chie and Makoto, no?
[0:39:53] <+BaronMWG328> This game has insta kills right?
[0:39:56] <+elderpunch> devil summor is smt if the apocalypse didnt happen
[0:40:01] <+simmsyfart> playing p4 for the first time, really missing the quality of life stuff from 5 and 5r

[0:40:29] <+elderpunch> @simmsyfart i still havent beat p2 and smt dds
[0:40:30] <@Menitta> yes. You must be on winning round, 100 meter, and be able to use Persona, 222 C+D
[0:40:36] <@Menitta> Shadow characters dont have them
[0:40:40] <zepelinnn1> @zepelinnn1 i..actaully can't remember, did Makoto wanted to join the force? hope P5R gets ported. P5 is the one i remember the least for some reason
[0:40:42] <SvenHolgersson> Clean as Reggie's face KEKHeim
[0:40:58] <+BaronMWG328> @Menitta Cool

[0:41:18] <mothdude> Some fun instant kills in this game
[0:41:21] <+BaronMWG328> @cartakus There's P3 chars
[0:41:25] <%dds333a> @cartakus only P3 and P4
[0:41:26] <marvel877> p4 and some of the p3 characters
[0:41:36] <cartakus> I see
[0:41:37] <FlamingNarwhal> p4 p3 and some original characters
[0:41:46] <%dds333a> This game followed the established method that P2 did
[0:41:53] <+elderpunch> still gotta finish devil survivor 2
[0:42:00] <wawila> @simmsyfart P4G is on PC which is my favorite. But remember when trying games backwards is that the quality of life and mechanics are going to be waaaaaaay different
[0:42:04] <%dds333a> Since P2 features adult versions of the P1 cast

[0:44:10] <thomasvalentine31> I am gonna buy the P4 arena ultimax remaster just so Atlus will now have an excuse to give us Persona 3 Fes and P4 golden on the rest of the consoles.
[0:44:13] <%ChillaxingJay> @elderpunch so true
[0:44:14] <Buddha0991> naoto is my least fav lol
[0:44:18] <%dds333a> @ekodrop he did

[0:47:34] <mephium> isn't it a dragon kick or whatever
[0:47:48] <thomasvalentine31> I just want a P3 remaster to just include the Answer. Yeah everybody dislikes it gameplay wise but it's just so important for Aigis and her character development.
[0:47:50] <mothdude> big dragon comes out of the ground around her irrc
[0:47:51] <+elderpunch> chie does her galatic punt
[0:47:51] <Buddha0991> again smtv just came out like 2 months ago lol

[0:49:04] <%Shad0wTag> @thomasvalentine31 100% agree it's a definitive conclusion to P3's story even if the gameplay is not the most fun.
[0:49:08] <+elderpunch> change p1 n p2 combat for modern persona and ur good tbh

[0:50:49] <%CaptainPileDriver> every days great AT YOUR JUNES
[0:50:52] <%Shad0wTag> @thomasvalentine31 Aye you nailed it on the head. Plus it y'know explains how Aigis got the Wild Card ability in the first place so its canon whether people like it or not
[0:51:09] <thomasvalentine31> @Shad0wTag True dat.
[0:51:16] <%Shad0wTag> @godgoshdarnit You mean about Yukkiko?
[0:51:24] <%dds333a> LUL LUL LUL
[0:51:25] <DSD24> Tomoe was always a cool design
[0:51:25] <FlamingNarwhal> I think Akihiko might be the coolest fighting game boxer  just for the teleporting around shit
[0:51:41] <@Menitta> I never finished P3. I need to break through and do that
[0:51:45] <%ChillaxingJay> biggest problem i had with The Answer was yukari being an insufferable bitch
[0:51:48] <%Shad0wTag> @thomasvalentine31 What would you make Atlus improve gameplay wise?
[0:51:54] <+elderpunch> @DSD24 P4's persona designs are sick alla round
[0:51:58] <thomasvalentine31> I legit didn't know Akihiko could pull some Dragon Ball z crap in this
[0:52:07] <%dds333a> For example, Lv3 corkscrew is a wallsplat, iirc
[0:52:08] <GodGoshDarnIt> @Shad0wTag P3 Answer
[0:52:13] <+elderpunch> izanagi got drip
[0:52:27] <%dds333a> @thomasvalentine31 ultimax specifically LUL
[0:52:30] <thomasvalentine31> @Shad0wTag Just let us control the party like the psp version when playing the Answer. That would be good enough. Maybe not auto setting the difficulty to hard as well would help
[0:52:32] <DSD24> I hope we see Elizabeth I love that she has three personas
[0:52:37] <GodGoshDarnIt> i didnt catch what we are talking about Yukiko
[0:52:39] <%Shad0wTag> @godgoshdarnit Ah right no worries fam. I like Aigis in P3 as well so I'm tad bit biased.
[0:52:45] <Buddha0991> ill never forgive atlus for blocking arcsys from letting dojima with a nanako perosna be a goofy secret character
[0:52:53] <+elderpunch> @Buddha0991 fax
[0:52:58] <%counterfeitgimmicks> Rise is best girl right?
[0:53:03] <fernanda_ps2> one more!
[0:53:07] <Sonny_Firestorm> P4 was when they started coordenating User and Persona designs.
[0:53:07] <+elderpunch> @counterfeitgimmicks not fax
[0:53:08] <OblivionSword1> @counterfeitgimmicks 100%
[0:53:12] <%ChillaxingJay> @buddha0991 yeah i definitely wanted to see what that looked like
[0:53:14] <+elderpunch> kanji best girl
[0:53:16] <%dds333a> @dsd24 more than three, she has the whole compendium LUL
[0:53:16] <Buddha0991> glad that zenkichi exists, we need more adult persona users on the squad
[0:53:25] <%Shad0wTag> @thomasvalentine31 Oh yeah if P3 ever gets released they have to include P3P's party control and proper compendium shenanigans in P5
[0:53:26] <%Tearonex> Teddie in drag is best girl
[0:53:30] <%counterfeitgimmicks> @elderpunch LUL
[0:53:36] <Buddha0991> if there is a p5a hopefully sumi, feral akechi, sophia and zenkichi are all playable
[0:53:38] <%Shad0wTag> @buddha0991 Zenkichi is very based
[0:53:48] <Sonny_Firestorm> Yeah, Zenkichi and [P5 Royal Spoiler Character] were breaths of fresh air.
[0:53:50] <%ChillaxingJay> @tearonex true
[0:53:51] <%dds333a> @sonny_firestorm P2 had elements of this already, it was just more in terms of outfits
[0:54:02] <thomasvalentine31> @Shad0wTag If we didn't already get a default main character for P3, Aigis would've been in the main character role for sure. Especially with how connected her entire arc is to the entire story of P3.
[0:54:16] <+IHATREID> will p5a bring back p3 & 4 characters or just be all about 5
[0:54:31] <Buddha0991> im not sure how they would handle it
[0:54:31] <+elderpunch> @IHATREID no one knows
[0:54:35] <FlamingNarwhal> either just p5 or p5 and older p4 cast
[0:54:36] <+MisterRockett> Yosuke took a hard nerf in Ultimax and it made getting back into the game really hard I might have to find a new main.
[0:54:45] <Sonny_Firestorm> @dds333a I mean, meaning-wise yes, but appearance-wise some were hit 'n miss.
[0:54:46] <FlamingNarwhal> p3 being back would be nice though but i feel like they wouldnt
[0:54:55] <vodska> bro imagine p5a with older p4 characters
[0:54:56] <%Shad0wTag> @thomasvalentine31 Oh yeah I can actually see that when you put it that way.
[0:54:57] <marcomatame> wtf babyface reggie
[0:54:58] <Buddha0991> i say have p5 and  just a few 3 and 4 characters in the plot, but have all of these guys available as bonus characters for vs play and other non story modes
[0:55:04] <thomasvalentine31> I also love how in this game, all of the P3 peeps got glasses.
[0:55:09] <%Shad0wTag> @ihatreid God knows dude
[0:55:11] <%ChillaxingJay> @vodska its what we all want
[0:55:26] <%dds333a> @elderpunch unfortunately, P4 was the game where Soejima committed to having  the ultimate Personas be literal palette swaps of their base forms, which look awful
[0:55:26] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:55:33] <thomasvalentine31> Even flipping Koromaru got goggles/glasses as well.
[0:55:35] <%dds333a> LUL LUL LUL
[0:55:37] <Sonny_Firestorm> The new release comes with all DLC included, right?
[0:55:47] <thomasvalentine31> @Sonny_Firestorm The remaster should
[0:55:47] <GodGoshDarnIt> @thomasvalentine31 oh Aigis is a main character in P3, but The Journey begins and ends perfectly, i dont think The Answer was needed
[0:55:47] <vodska> @ChillaxingJay imagine if the p4 characters got masks like the p3 chars got glasses
[0:55:50] <%Shad0wTag> I do appreiciate in P5R having both Makato and Narukami being secret bosses like I want more of that
[0:55:59] <+elderpunch> @dds333a i agree p5r had really bad designs for the tier 3 personas lol
[0:55:59] <%townzzzzz> DO IT REGGIE
[0:56:00] <stormhawk9891> Now gold burst and do it again
[0:56:01] <%dds333a> @sonny_firestorm same goes for P4 LUL
[0:56:04] <%counterfeitgimmicks> Is Reggie port 2?
[0:56:06] <%ChillaxingJay> @sonny_firestorm it better
[0:56:13] <GodGoshDarnIt> but more P3 is always welcomed
[0:56:15] <Sonny_Firestorm> @Shad0wTag Shame they were paid DLC. KEKW
[0:56:23] <Buddha0991> its odd how for the p3 cast the tier 2 personas are the more iconic ones but the 4 and 5 cast, tier 1 is the iconic ones
[0:56:38] <Sonny_Firestorm> @Buddha0991 This was intentional.
[0:56:47] <Buddha0991> i think the fact that p3 characters gain theirs through character development helps them become more iconic
[0:56:48] <Sonny_Firestorm> Starting with P4, the evolutions became non-canon.
[0:56:48] <%Shad0wTag> @dds333a Are you referring to the originals in P4 or the upgraded ultimate personas in P4G?
[0:57:05] <Sonny_Firestorm> All evolutions are non-canon now.
[0:57:07] <GodGoshDarnIt> @Buddha0991 right on!
[0:57:07] <%Shad0wTag> @sonny_firestorm Wait they were? I legit didn't know
[0:57:25] <%dds333a> @shad0wtag both, they all look terrible, more so P4 OG
[0:57:30] <+elderpunch> persona 6 will be about technology
[0:57:33] <+elderpunch> mark my words
[0:57:37] <%Shad0wTag> @sonny_firestorm Minus Yu based on Izanagi no Ookami
[0:57:41] <thomasvalentine31> In regards to this game, I think the Persona evolutions for the P4 cast is too much "extra" animation. Which would require more resources and what not.
[0:57:45] <Kusano123> persona 6 will be about NFTs
[0:57:48] <+IHATREID> is that true for everybody or just the main cast? wouldnt ribbon girls persona change not make sense then
[0:57:50] <OblivionSword1> so does that mean the final social links never happens ?
[0:57:56] <%CaptainPileDriver> the shadow versions are almost universally terrible
[0:57:59] <Buddha0991> i think there was a throwaway line in one of these p4 games where not training had the persona devolve into their stage 1 forms but i dont know if thats legit or something im misremembering
[0:58:00] <%ChillaxingJay> @elderpunch but will we get p6 in this lifetime? 🤔
[0:58:00] <%dds333a> Soejima almost fixed with P5, and then cocked it up again with Royal
[0:58:06] <thomasvalentine31> The P3 cast keeping their Ultimates was a way to distinguish their personas from the P4 cast
[0:58:17] <fernanda_ps2> kof max mode
[0:58:28] <+elderpunch> @Kusano123 LUL
[0:58:30] <%Shad0wTag> @dds333a I don't hate them I like them so I'm probably the wrong person here
[0:58:31] <stormhawk9891> Shadow Naoto is a funny character
[0:58:32] <+elderpunch> @ChillaxingJay yes
[0:58:33] <thomasvalentine31> @Buddha0991 I recall that being a kind of line in Persona 2 or something
[0:58:35] <+Malchiah_Tenabre> show him teddy
[0:58:48] <@Menitta> Shadow characters have no burst but Shadow Frenzy instead, original auto, no IK, 80% damage, +200 health, can do awakened SP skills any time. @WoolieVersus
[0:58:51] <%dds333a> @thomasvalentine31 not P2
[0:58:53] <+MisterRockett> Wait does Shadow Yosuke's moonsults work they way they did in Arena!?
[0:58:53] <%ChillaxingJay> @elderpunch idk i kinda doubt it
[0:59:04] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @Sonny_Firestorm
[0:59:20] <@Menitta> damn moobot hates social links
[0:59:21] <%dds333a> LUL LUL
[0:59:22] <Buddha0991> p6 should do what persona 2 did tbh, slinks/confidants give you access to the Prime version of the first persona, but the second evolved version should be story based
[0:59:26] <Buddha0991> could be hard to pull off though

[0:59:41] <Sonny_Firestorm> @thomasvalentine31 I'm tellin ya man, it's because they were main story events that couldn't be missed. After that they made All evolutions Link rewards to spare themselves the hassle.
[0:59:44] <OblivionSword1> MISSIONARY OF MEAT
[0:59:51] <BlackermanZX> time to make history SourPls
[0:59:54] <%dds333a> Woolie with the shaded version of the character, just like GG LUL
[0:59:56] <+IHATREID> is arena the first game where they started boiling characters down to certain personality traits?
[1:00:04] <@Menitta> yeah kinda
[1:00:04] <thomasvalentine31> @Sonny_Firestorm Ya that makes sense too
[1:00:09] <+elderpunch> SO STEP ON UP TO THE PLATE
[1:00:11] <%dds333a> @ihatreid you could say
[1:00:13] <%Shad0wTag> @dds333a I personally think the base Persona 3 casts Personas look really uncool and almost incomplete by comparison like Akihiko's inital is not anywhere as cool
[1:00:18] <%ChillaxingJay> SourPls
[1:00:24] <+elderpunch> @IHATREID i think so ye
[1:00:27] <Buddha0991> im gonna say something that most people dont know, supposedly the og jp p3 script had a lot more jokes with akihiko and protein that the dub removed
[1:00:36] <zzNamttamzz> adoreWiggle adoreWiggle adoreWiggle
[1:00:41] <+elderpunch> they pretty much do this in every persona spin off
[1:00:41] <leomuratore> IT'S TIME TO MAKE HISTORY
[1:00:43] <%ChillaxingJay> @buddha0991 lmao
[1:00:47] <Sonny_Firestorm> @Buddha0991 very much possible
[1:00:47] <%Shad0wTag> @ihatreid No it was Q
[1:01:05] <+elderpunch> characters are boiled down to their most basic traits
[1:01:05] <thomasvalentine31> I will say this, the two Persona dancing games: Dancing in Starlight/Moonlight were actually pretty fun. And their social link "events" were interesting with how the characters felt and stuff.
[1:01:06] <Buddha0991> but chie becoming so focused on meat is very much a flanderization lol
[1:01:09] <%dds333a> @shad0wtag which is fine, because my issue is with ultimate Personas being little more than palette swaps, it's so disappointing
[1:01:11] <+esoteric_simp> SourPls
[1:01:15] <@Menitta> Q was way worse than P4A was with personalities because P4A is a fighting game. It gets a pass on that
[1:01:16] <+elderpunch> @Buddha0991 exactly
[1:01:25] <@Menitta> Q is an 80 hour long RPG
[1:01:29] <%dds333a> Kaneko personas didn't do that whatsoever
[1:01:29] <GodGoshDarnIt> @Shad0wTag but is Nemesis cooler lookin than Hala-Nemi? i think so LUL
[1:01:29] <%ChillaxingJay> SourPls
[1:01:30] <Buddha0991> i think they got better at writing spinoffs cuz P5S mostly felt good, sans Futaba thanking the RNG gods every 2 minutes
[1:01:39] <+elderpunch> pootaba

[1:02:01] <+elderpunch> LUL LUL
[1:02:09] <+Crippl3> what is the point of that vacuum move? it looks useless
[1:02:13] <Sonny_Firestorm> Ok, now can we see characters other than Akihiko and Chie?
[1:02:14] <%Fetrigon> taunt to get bodied OMEGALUL
[1:02:14] <thomasvalentine31> Persona q probably did that because it has to assume some people didn't actually play either persona 3 or persona 4. So  you get a spark notes/pdf version of their main or closeish, personality quirks/traits
[1:02:17] <mephium> it's an instakill
[1:02:19] <%dds333a> it keeps people in
[1:02:22] <@Menitta> @Crippl3 close distance
[1:02:25] <+IHATREID> doesnt akihiko in 3 more lament being weak and not being able to properly shoulder his burdens
[1:02:27] <%ChillaxingJay> @sonny_firestorm nope
[1:02:27] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1478257606875815940?t=yjLm7ZYgulpaxSOSAEFNpA&s=19
[1:02:28] <%dds333a> the instakill is something else LUL
[1:02:32] <blue_grave> @mothdude akihiko in p5A: steroidssteroidssteroids
[1:02:35] <mephium> oh wait LUL
[1:02:45] <%Shad0wTag> @menitta Plus in Arena they objectively hate the nicknames General Teddie gives them as their over exaggurations and are typically embarrassed by it
[1:03:01] <%dds333a> Akihiko has a normal that also vacuums rot make up for his lack or range
[1:03:07] <%Shad0wTag> @sonny_firestorm Yes tell them not to play their mains
[1:03:14] <thomasvalentine31> @IHATREID Yeah he trains to be hella strong. I thik by the time of persona 4 arena, before getting called in, he's basically boxing with grizzly bears out in the wilds as part of his training regiment.
[1:03:21] <+elderpunch> Futaba being a video game reference machine is probably the most annoying thing atlus wrote for a character
[1:03:30] <+elderpunch> aside from teddie being a pervert
[1:03:35] <Sonny_Firestorm> @Shad0wTag Backup mains are important too.
[1:03:48] <%dds333a> @thomasvalentine31 they did it for jokes, that's all. the Q games are just omake LUL
[1:03:51] <%ChillaxingJay> @sonny_firestorm true dat
[1:03:52] <+yeknomlive> core a gaming
[1:03:53] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Kappa
[1:03:56] <+yeknomlive> i love that video
[1:04:10] <blue_grave> need a new core a gaming vidoes in my life
[1:04:11] <Buddha0991> supposedly teddie being a legit perv is also a localization issue, from what i saw his pervy moments in the jp script were supposed to come across much more as a kid talking about stuff they know absolutely nothing about as opposed to teddie legit just being horny all the time
[1:04:32] <+elderpunch> orly
[1:04:32] <%Shad0wTag> @sonny_firestorm Aye but Woolie said that he plays Akihiko specifically as Reggie is trying to learn Chie give them a break dude
[1:04:51] <Sonny_Firestorm> @Shad0wTag Fair enough
[1:04:55] <@Menitta> that is the best IK
[1:04:55] <%dds333a> see ya
[1:04:55] <Buddha0991> p4 is said to be a lot more faithful aside from these problems with teddie
[1:04:57] <+Crippl3> that's awesome lol
[1:04:59] <mephium> he gone
[1:05:03] <leomuratore> Galactic put!!!
[1:05:07] <thomasvalentine31> It's okay: at least Teddie has a boston accent robo toaster waifu now.
[1:05:11] <+IHATREID> i like teddie so i dont really get it
[1:05:18] <%ChillaxingJay> @buddha0991 thats disappointing cuz i get sick of teddies pervyness but still like the character
[1:05:19] <Sonny_Firestorm> The only IK that actually works like it did in the source material. LUL
[1:05:22] <Buddha0991> i like teddie too but he can be obnoxious sometimes
[1:05:28] <Buddha0991> still a lot better than morgana imo
[1:05:38] <%Shad0wTag> @dds333a Q1 bein canon is the silliest thing they could of done since no one wanted it to be
[1:05:45] <+IHATREID> i liked morgana too but i played royal as my initial 5
[1:05:54] <thomasvalentine31> Say what ya will about Teddie: he has done things and made great progress compared to about almost all of the Shadows out there.
[1:05:58] <FlamingNarwhal> teddie is annoying at times but hes not straight up bratty and whiny like morgana gets
[1:05:58] <+IHATREID> he did piss me off when he ran away for drama tho
[1:05:59] <%dds333a> @shad0wtag that's how it is LUL
[1:06:00] <%ChillaxingJay> at leadt teddie doesnt force u to sleep
[1:06:02] <Buddha0991> q1 being canon is basically just a way to market the game cuz the game ends with the game itself writing itself out of canon
[1:06:07] <+elderpunch> Morgana is definetly more annoying than teddie
[1:06:18] <Sonny_Firestorm> @Buddha0991 I like Morgana more often than I like Teddie, but one of the few times Morgana was an ass was especially unforgivable. (the Okumura arc)
[1:06:20] <TTouchdown> Teddie also ran away for drama
[1:06:30] <%Shad0wTag> @thomasvalentine31 Personally I liked how he was by the stories end. He made a great friend fo Nanako
[1:06:32] <+elderpunch> @TTouchdown yea but that made sense
[1:06:37] <%dds333a> @buddha0991 exactly, it might as well have never happened
[1:06:48] <+IHATREID> yeah but morganas drama run away was just him being a pissbaby
[1:06:55] <+elderpunch> morgana ran away cuz his ego was hurt over nothing
[1:06:57] <perfect_disaster> @elderpunch no hes not
[1:07:04] <thomasvalentine31> @Buddha0991 Both Dancing Games and both Q games are canon but yeah, Atlus was hella bent on making sure nobody remembered everything: and yet by the time Persona 4 Arena/Ultimax comes about....
[1:07:08] <Sonny_Firestorm> @IHATREID Nah, I just hate him for ruining Best Floof's arc.
[1:07:09] <@Menitta> I like Mona more tbh
[1:07:18] <@Menitta> God these combos go so high
[1:07:29] <thomasvalentine31> I like morgana simply because my cat is a Tuxedo, and that auto makes me biased.
[1:07:30] <+IHATREID> to be fair, atlus ruined haru's arc not morgana
[1:07:36] <FlamingNarwhal> morgana constantly starting shit with ryuji and then getting upset when ryuji retaliates also just always annoys me
[1:07:37] <Buddha0991> teddie might be flanderized in the arena games but his moments with labrys are really good and do show his character development, how hes able to legit bond with her due to the shared experience of being the "other" of the group
[1:07:47] <%dds333a> who the fuck is Haru Kappa
[1:07:55] <Sonny_Firestorm> At least P5 Strikers fixed a lot of those issues.
[1:07:57] <%Shad0wTag> @thomasvalentine31 Wait P3D and PSD are canon? I thought they werent. I know P4D was
[1:07:57] <cheap_turbo> guys, don't do persona politics, I wanna see combos
[1:08:00] <thomasvalentine31> Labrys is cool
[1:08:01] <TTouchdown> Morgana can at least hold conversations that aren’t  only his gimmick
[1:08:04] <Heefnoff> We going online?
[1:08:08] <perfect_disaster> is anybody online?
[1:08:09] <Buddha0991> labrys is very cool
[1:08:09] <@Menitta> [sharpens fight stick]
[1:08:14] <+IHATREID> good thing u can see them do combos and we can talk persona then
[1:08:19] <Sonny_Firestorm> @cheap_turbo True, waifu wars in Persona are legendary for their lethality.
[1:08:20] <Heefnoff> Good luck boys
[1:08:21] <thomasvalentine31> @Shad0wTag They are in their social links which actually hint at stuff shown with characters in Persona 4 Arena/Ultimax
[1:08:32] <%MajorCrasher> Haru? you mean least important party member? Kappa
[1:08:32] <Buddha0991> sho minazuki tho, thats a character lmao
[1:08:34] <YVector26> Akihiko mains RISE UP PogChamp
[1:08:38] <%Shad0wTag> @perfect_disaster Its Parsec pretty much anyone of is with a pc and a controller can
[1:08:39] <+elderpunch> waifu wars more like waifu bores!!!
[1:08:44] <thomasvalentine31> @Shad0wTag For example, in Dancing in Moonlight, Junpei in a social link, explains how he wants to be a teacher and stuff
[1:08:46] <%dds333a> @yvector26 we out here
[1:08:47] <%ChillaxingJay> people be killing each other over persona waifus
[1:08:51] <@Menitta> Society has evolved beyond Waifu wars
[1:08:56] <Buddha0991> i kind of like sho a tiny bit, hes so lame i find it kind of charming actually
[1:08:59] <mothdude> this stage rules
[1:09:01] <%Shad0wTag> @majorcrasher Haru in P5S gets some solid developmenr
[1:09:02] <thomasvalentine31> @Shad0wTag Cue Persona 4 arena ultimax, he's a little league baseball coach
[1:09:08] <GodGoshDarnIt> AHH HELL YEAH THATS MY JAM
[1:09:10] <%ChillaxingJay> LOVE THIS SONG SourPls
[1:09:17] <KingNocturne> YOOOO FAVORITE SONG~!!
[1:09:17] <YVector26> SourPls
[1:09:20] <%MajorCrasher> @shad0wtag I know, I'm just teasing
[1:09:21] <BlackermanZX> SourPls
[1:09:21] <+IHATREID> the sound of junpei's bat is super satisfying too
[1:09:23] <+elderpunch> SourPls
[1:09:24] <perfect_disaster> @Shad0wTag oh yeah my bad
[1:09:25] <Buddha0991> p4a leaves it open if you want to think chidori lived or died, the writing for junpei works both ways
[1:09:27] <%dds333a> Changing seasons, yeah LUL
[1:09:27] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:09:28] <@Menitta> the stages in this game are amazing
[1:09:35] <Sonny_Firestorm> @Shad0wTag At least he has an income, unlike Akihiko LUL
[1:09:43] <DSD24> This is a good song
[1:09:43] <FlamingNarwhal> Junpei's bat is the best sound in fighting games i wont be taking criticism
[1:09:50] <%dds333a> @elderpunch LUL
[1:09:51] <Buddha0991> akihiko is fighting drunks in brazil what a random development for him
[1:09:54] <thomasvalentine31> @Shad0wTag In one of Ken's Social links in the dancing game, he talks about dancing and stuff and what not. Cue Persona 4 Arena Ultimax, he's doing duet fighting techniques with Koromaru
[1:10:06] <%dds333a> Time for French, like Le Monde a Glace
[1:10:07] <%Shad0wTag> @perfect_disaster I am in the camp where I actually prefer P5S to P5R as a sequel
[1:10:08] <Sonny_Firestorm> @Buddha0991 As a brazilian myself, I think it makes perfect sense.
[1:10:15] <%ChillaxingJay> LUL
[1:10:24] <+IHATREID> @Buddha0991 why would they write it this way if she can survive in fes?
[1:10:29] <%MajorCrasher> p5R isn't a sequel tho
[1:10:38] <%MajorCrasher> it's just golden/fes
[1:10:38] <%Shad0wTag> @thomasvalentine31 So do both dancing games take place before those games end then?
[1:10:39] <Sonny_Firestorm> @MajorCrasher No, but Strikers is
[1:10:46] <DSD24> The sway
[1:10:47] <thomasvalentine31> @Shad0wTag In the Mitsuru Social Link in P3Dancing, you can legit call her the Queen of Executions.  In persona 4 arena ultimax, her nickname in that game is "The Queen of Executions"
[1:10:52] <Buddha0991> her survival is an optional obscure event that a lot of people missed
[1:10:53] <%dds333a> LUL
[1:10:55] <%Shad0wTag> @majorcrasher I know I just didnt have a better way of wording it
[1:11:04] <Buddha0991> so they opted to make it ambiguous if she lived or not
[1:11:06] <Sonny_Firestorm> @Shad0wTag P4 Dancing is a sequel, P5/3 are dubious canon/dreams.
[1:11:18] <thomasvalentine31> @Shad0wTag Persona 3 Dancing takes place during the part of Persona 3 when the storm is happening, before the true ending route
[1:11:21] <perfect_disaster> @Shad0wTag yeah I totally agree
[1:11:34] <OblivionSword1> does P4 dancing happens before or after arena ?
[1:11:40] <%ChillaxingJay> SourPls
[1:11:44] <+IHATREID> huh i guess i stumbled into the better option with chidori then cuz i didnt know she would just die otherwise
[1:11:47] <Buddha0991> i remember when everyone thought that nyarly was gonna be the villain of ultimax and the p1/2 characters were in that shadow ops group picture in teh shadows
[1:11:54] <Sonny_Firestorm> @OblivionSword1 I forget, but I think Dancing happens after both arenas.
[1:12:10] <%Shad0wTag> @sonny_firestorm Okay that's more what I thought. I knew about P4D since I played it on release
[1:12:20] <%dds333a> @ihatreid that option isnt even there in OG P3
[1:12:24] <Buddha0991> to be fair the malevolent entity is actually voiced by p2 is psp's voice for nyarly and has several of his personality characteristics lol
[1:12:31] <%dds333a> Chidori canonically dies and that's it
[1:12:32] <Sonny_Firestorm> @dds333a No, it was a FES addition.
[1:12:36] <%Shad0wTag> @oblivionsword1 After
[1:12:47] <%dds333a> @sonny_firestorm that's what I said
[1:12:52] <+IHATREID> well yeah but why would i play vanilla when fes/p3p exist
[1:12:53] <%Shad0wTag> @buddha0991 God i remember that the fandom was seething
[1:12:59] <%dds333a> It isn't there
[1:13:00] <%JetpackMcQuack> slap fights
[1:13:03] <%MajorCrasher> LUL
[1:13:05] <perfect_disaster> damn
[1:13:05] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[1:13:06] <$xeromage> ICQ in here
[1:13:07] <%ChillaxingJay> LUL
[1:13:07] <%dds333a> LUL
[1:13:12] <Admiral_PopnFresh> these health bars are chunky
[1:13:18] <Buddha0991> i used to be one of them until i cooled and accepted that atlus most likely wont cross over 1 and 2 into 3/4/5 and thats ok
[1:13:18] <vnzuelandude> hammer time
[1:13:19] <+PMAvers> Uh oh? Uh oh. Uh oh!
[1:13:31] <%Shad0wTag> @ihatreid P3P is debatable as a replacement but controllable party is too good
[1:13:31] <thomasvalentine31> Persona 5Dancing takes place during a lull in the story too. Both dancing games, p3d and p5d, are "canon" going by their social links. The thing is though, once, our parties wake up, they don't remember the events of the dancing.  Also, there's a part in both games where their Navigators, Futaba and Fuuka, detect the other group
[1:13:36] <Sonny_Firestorm> @IHATREID For the save carry over into FES, to start the game with enough Academics to pass the first exam. LUL
[1:14:05] <%dds333a> @buddha0991 although they still do LUL
[1:14:09] <%Shad0wTag> @buddha0991 This is a world where Nyarly and Philemon just are not trying to involve themselves anymore after P2 is what I tell myself
[1:14:13] <%dds333a> Just not as obviously
[1:14:24] <Sonny_Firestorm> @thomasvalentine31 Yeah, Futaba gets a brief moment of connection and hacks Fuuka's PC. LUL
[1:14:32] <Buddha0991> they have small cameos and nods
[1:14:35] <Buddha0991> im fine with that
[1:14:38] <%dds333a> The Kirijo Group is a direct offshoot of the Nanjo Group, for example
[1:14:42] <%CaptainPileDriver> someone hit the insta kill, cause you know they won't expect it
[1:15:02] <Buddha0991> katsuya is mentioned in that discussion of persona detectives on the tv in p5 along with akihiko chie and adachi
[1:15:07] <@Menitta> I insta killed Woolie last P4AU GIFG. I shall try again
[1:15:13] <%Shad0wTag> @captainpiledriver Haven't played in 5 years but I will try
[1:15:29] <Sonny_Firestorm> @CaptainPileDriver would be if the obvious 100SP requirment didn't give it away
[1:15:34] <%townzzzzz> LUL
[1:15:37] <%CaptainPileDriver> i mean considering this chat there's bout to be a ton of kanji's
[1:15:40] <%dds333a> Get Maziodyne'd
[1:15:50] <Sonny_Firestorm> Rage disables block.
[1:15:53] <%Shad0wTag> @buddha0991 As they should but to be honest for me the P2 cast struggled so hard to get their lives back I wouldn't want them involved into anything that would disrupt that
[1:16:02] <Sonny_Firestorm> Confusion reverses left and right
[1:16:07] <@Menitta> Im just gonna go Yu. I like Chie the most but i think I'm just best with Yu
[1:16:08] <%ChillaxingJay> SourPls
[1:16:14] <%JetpackMcQuack> damn akihiko
[1:16:18] <thomasvalentine31> So both Q games and Dancing games are legit canon, but Atlus just insists are not pigeon holing themselves in coming up with a legit explanation to connect everybody together. So the handwaving "everybody forgets" is the easiest method sadly to use.
[1:16:27] <%CaptainPileDriver> @Menitta give me my chair boi and i'm good, command grabs and yelling
[1:16:27] <%JetpackMcQuack> brought his RPG ailments
[1:16:27] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:16:30] <%Shad0wTag> @menitta Yu and Sho are really fun shotos
[1:16:41] <Buddha0991> Sho to
[1:16:52] <%dds333a> Gtab resets, as you do
[1:17:02] <thomasvalentine31> Joker's social link in the P5 Dancing is interesting. You learn that he legit wants to open up his own Coffee Shop later on in life.
[1:17:09] <Sonny_Firestorm> @thomasvalentine31 Except for P4D they're all memory wipe adventures.
[1:17:18] <%CaptainPileDriver> the realest hero of the stream will be whoever get's Junpei to his powered up state
[1:17:25] <%Shad0wTag> @thomasvalentine31 I think Atlus underestimates people having their dream game of characters just all hanging out together and their not being a reason for it
[1:17:26] <%Renzaku69> This for fun or for glory?
[1:17:35] <DSD24> Elizabeth is the best Attendant
[1:17:37] <%JetpackMcQuack> more negging in fighting games
[1:17:40] <Sonny_Firestorm> @thomasvalentine31 Well yeah, it's part of his canonical personality. (they make silent protags out of tradition but they have personalities of their own)
[1:17:41] <%CaptainPileDriver> @Renzaku69 yes
[1:17:42] <DSD24> She got the best outfit
[1:17:44] <thomasvalentine31> @thomasvalentine31 Oh yeah that's right, P4 Dancing is a canon sequel to P4 and they get spared the mind wipe
[1:17:45] <%Shad0wTag> @renzaku69 That's a really good question I didn't catch the intro to the stream
[1:17:59] <%Renzaku69> @Renzaku69 lol oh its like that XD
[1:17:59] <%Shad0wTag> @dsd24 I'm a Margaret man
[1:18:14] <thomasvalentine31> @thomasvalentine31 I know that but I thought it was cool to see what Joker legit wanted outside of the main line games.
[1:18:23] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> > Shadow Naoto
[1:18:30] <%dds333a> @sonny_firestorm except they literally only get personality in games outside their own LUL
[1:18:44] <%Shad0wTag> @thomasvalentine31 I just wish they kept their Golden epilogue appearances instead of whatever reason defaulting BACK to their normal outfits and appearances
[1:18:49] <%dds333a> Atlus protags are categorically mimes with no aganecy and all the emotional range of wood
[1:19:14] <Sonny_Firestorm> @dds333a That is true to P3 and P4, but with some things Joker doesn't let you pick What you say, only How.
[1:19:15] <%ChillaxingJay> @shad0wtag same i like those designs a lot
[1:19:17] <Buddha0991> its silly that the dancing game starts with their epilogue appearances but they have to come up wit ha silly reason to go back to their p4 selves
[1:19:20] <thomasvalentine31> @Shad0wTag Actually, I think the Epilogue takes place AFTER both P4 Dancing and Persona 4 Arena
[1:19:39] <thomasvalentine31> the event they were talking about last summer or what not? IIRC, they were refering to the events of  Arena.
[1:19:55] <%RemedyofRevenge> I have never played, and hardly seen anything from a Persona game before. What is the rub of this game?
[1:20:15] <%Shad0wTag> @dds333a Except when their not the main characters but you piece together what their like based their options. Like Yu has very odd things to say and Minato is very emo and Joker is pretty rude to adults
[1:20:18] <Sonny_Firestorm> @RemedyofRevenge They're SMT games but more beginner friendly
[1:20:20] <%dds333a> @sonny_firestorm Marginally, he's just as bland and one not as the rest. but hey, he talks just slightly more in combat LUL
[1:20:26] <thomasvalentine31> I gotta finish the P4 Dancing game, I stopped around the halfway point of the story once the gang started piecing everything together.
[1:20:32] <mothdude> @RemedyofRevenge The gimmick of the fighting game is that they all have stands.

[1:20:37] <%RemedyofRevenge> Not gonna lie @Sonny_Firestorm I have not played an SMT game ever
[1:20:39] <%dds333a> @shad0wtag which is to say, not much
[1:20:42] <+Prinny_Raider> you don't have to mash AB in this game. You can just hold it iirc
[1:20:42] <%Shad0wTag> @chillaxingjay You wouldn't believe that was only a few months after the ending when they look years older
[1:21:04] <+AstroNovaTV> @prinny_raider that's only in 2.0
[1:21:10] <+AstroNovaTV> unfort
[1:21:15] <%CaptainPileDriver> i'm gonna be honest, i think the persona dancing games are all bad and have some really bad remix's of the persona music
[1:21:19] <%ChillaxingJay> @shad0wtag ikr? they look so different
[1:21:42] <Buddha0991> p5d is trash because it came before pq2 p5r and p5s where some of the best p5 music all came from
[1:21:53] <%Shad0wTag> @captainpiledriver I think P4D remixes are better than P5D's but I think P3D's music is better than either
[1:21:56] <Sonny_Firestorm> @RemedyofRevenge Imagine Pokémon, but less child friendly and more mad max/fist of the north star.
[1:22:08] <+AstroNovaTV> P5S music goes crazy
[1:22:21] <@Menitta> I still listen to Royal Days every now and then
[1:22:21] <thomasvalentine31> Overall, the Persona spin-off games all like have decent important plot stuff in their own ways. Even Persona 4 Arena was interesting to see what actually became of the whole P3 crew and where they are at. The whole Shadow Operative thing with Mitsuru is probably the most badass development.
[1:22:22] <%ChillaxingJay> @buddha0991 yeah p5d came out too early. a lot of the remixes are mid
[1:22:30] <FlamingNarwhal> I just wish P5D and P3D has proper story modes instead of just social links
[1:22:35] <%CaptainPileDriver> @Shad0wTag i think p4d is the only one that scrapes out of the music remix's but other than that i just think they're bad rhythm games.
[1:22:48] <OblivionSword1> the musou instrumentation in P5S ost is amazing
[1:23:05] <%Shad0wTag> @chillaxingjay They all look like they grew from their trauma visually. Chie and Naoto being more feminine, Yukkiko keeping her hair short, Teddie getting taller and more normal clothes ect
[1:23:10] <%CaptainPileDriver> now we GOING ONLINE BOIS
[1:23:12] <Buddha0991> p5s is a good spinoff but unfortunately it was developed side by side with p5r and the two teams didnt talk much leading both to kind of go for similar plots to each other lol
[1:23:12] <thomasvalentine31> @FlamingNarwhal I agree. It's story is pretty much just "Hey wanna be in a dance off?" yeah: lets have fun and forget all our sorrows for a night.
[1:23:14] <%CaptainPileDriver> LETS GO
[1:23:34] <Buddha0991> also

[1:23:56] <%RemedyofRevenge> who is the best jeanist looking mf character in the middle there?
[1:24:01] <%Shad0wTag> @thomasvalentine31 I 100% agree P3 and P4 work as a great dualogy
[1:24:03] <@Menitta> They will be using Parsec.
[1:24:04] <thomasvalentine31> I like Kasumi. Even though I think her second Persona Evolution looks a hella lot better than her third/final Ella.
[1:24:05] <TigerClaws12> switching to the arcade build?

[1:41:34] <zepelinnn1> because he has issues, actually
[1:41:34] <funnyfunnykid> the important thing for me is, is Junpei a freak like that dude with the headsets?
[1:41:34] <@Menitta> they are on parsec
[1:41:39] <+Superbro64> PC version is out already?
[1:41:41] <+Superbro64> huh
[1:41:42] <mothdude> Junpei is a huge jerk early on but he apologizes and improves which gives him points for me.
[1:41:42] <Buddha0991> who is the best buddy character
[1:41:45] <MagsPowerLive> is this RPCS3 or NESiCA crack?
[1:41:46] <Heefnoff> No they're using Parsec
[1:41:51] <FlamingNarwhal> @Superbro64 this is emulation and parsec
[1:41:52] <+projectmanatees> Ken is the worst

[1:42:09] <%dds333a> @dabeaminator not Eikichi Kappa
[1:42:10] <thomasvalentine31> Junpei does it becaue "the plot demands it"
[1:42:14] <Sonny_Firestorm> Story-wise maybe, gameplay-wise Junpei is one of the best PMs in the game.
[1:42:15] <%jinking79> won tourny with the ik grab
[1:42:16] <dabeaminator> @Buddha0991 Junpei in 3, Yosuke in 4, and Ryuji in 5.

[1:43:19] <thomasvalentine31> @Menitta I've always heard boston
[1:43:21] <PizzicatoFive5> Marie had a side-game?

[1:45:15] <thomasvalentine31> All persona buddies have their moments, they are flawed human beings like everybody else. sadly the plot demands when it plots
[1:45:20] <Sonny_Firestorm> @WoolieVersus Maybe do Reggie vs Persona this year?
[1:45:23] <%dds333a> @shad0wtag it is, they both suck
[1:45:24] <%townzzzzz> panic DP
[1:45:25] <+PMAvers> Uh oh!
[1:45:31] <dabeaminator> @Shad0wTag If you go along with him and throw the wrong suspect into the TV during the hospital sequence you get the bad end.

[1:45:48] <KingNocturne> TRIED IT
[1:45:50] <%Shad0wTag> @dds333a I didn't hate the P4 ones that much. I think their a product of their time
[1:45:52] <%ChillaxingJay> LUL
[1:45:56] <YVector26> No IK LUL
[1:45:59] <%CaptainPileDriver> you tried, and that's all we ask
[1:46:21] <%CaptainPileDriver> i tried to hit the insta kill but woolie was on my ass
[1:46:25] <+zeoroot> Yeah shadow Labrys has Asterios the Minotaur as her shadow/persona
[1:46:36] <Sonny_Firestorm> Atlus stumbled with the first few P5 spin-offs, but then they knocked it out of the part with Strikers.
[1:46:39] <%Shad0wTag> Shadow Labby is really cool
[1:46:57] <%dds333a> @shad0wtag I would he inclined to agree if Atlus wasn't making infinitely better dungeons in games released less than a decade ago
[1:47:06] <gecomaman> I’ve never been more bored with a game I should like than strikers
[1:47:10] <%townzzzzz> OH NO
[1:47:14] <%Shad0wTag> @sonny_firestorm God a Persona game with no time limit was my dream it pulled awayball of my perfectionist anxiety
[1:47:16] <+FuqBoiSlim> Wait besides Q2 what other p5 spin-offs were there?
[1:47:17] <YVector26> gg
[1:47:18] <KingNocturne> Someone's gettin brave
[1:47:19] <%Irridium> I tried LUL
[1:47:20] <%ChillaxingJay> nice one reggie
[1:47:23] <thomasvalentine31> Strikers feels like a persona game
[1:47:28] <@Menitta> https://parsec.gg/g/1kqg1jyMZxgFVbcW9eROpSy4YBs/ad5d4662/
[1:47:28] <%Irridium> yeah it was 2 gg
[1:47:29] <Heefnoff> Labrys only wants one thing and it's disgusting
[1:47:29] <PizzicatoFive5> the dancing game
[1:47:29] <%CaptainPileDriver> @Irridium YOU did and we respect you
[1:47:42] <%CaptainPileDriver> someone WILL hit one today
[1:47:46] <thomasvalentine31> @FuqBoiSlim Persona 5 Strikers, Q2, and Dancing in Starlight
[1:47:50] <Sonny_Firestorm> Yeah, shame people can't play Strikers cause it spoils tons about P5.
[1:47:56] <%dds333a> LUL LUL
[1:48:00] <%Shad0wTag> @fuqboislim P5S and P5D
[1:48:10] <+zeoroot> PQ 2 and p5 dancing?
[1:48:12] <DSD24> We got a Mirror!
[1:48:19] <+DeadStage> @Sonny_Firestorm literally only reason i haven't played it yet
[1:48:20] <$guiltyboya> Just put P5 Royal on Steam, already!
[1:48:23] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Chie mirror, better turn the music off so we can enjoy this
[1:48:24] <OblivionSword1> it's still weird that P5S is on PC but not Royal or vanilla
[1:48:26] <%Shad0wTag> @sonny_firestorm That's a given yeah
[1:48:28] <thomasvalentine31> Also the joker dlc in Catherine
[1:48:28] <dabeaminator> @Sonny_Firestorm I mean yeah, it's a sequel. Why would you play it without having played 5?
[1:48:31] <+Joe2187> how yall playing this online?
[1:48:32] <+PMAvers> Strikers feels like the natural progression from P5 into a new game without having to nerf the PC's. Moving from fighting a couple of guys in the RPG to fighting massive hordes of enemies.
[1:48:41] <TerpanderLux> monkaS goosebumps slime
[1:48:44] <%Shad0wTag> @oblivionsword1 Like how Arena was on 360 but P4G was on Vita only
[1:48:45] <+FuqBoiSlim> omg I forgot the rhythm game existed entirely. I thought it was just a P4 thing gigaboOtsMJOW1
[1:48:48] <%CaptainPileDriver> which chie is reggie.
[1:48:56] <%CaptainPileDriver> okay so the blue
[1:49:00] <@Menitta> I wasnt big on P5S. The spikes in difficulty on bosses was so unfun for me.
[1:49:01] <mister_menace09> what's the difference between this and ortiginal game
[1:49:01] <Buddha0991> nice jam chie colors
[1:49:09] <thomasvalentine31> @FuqBoiSlim It was and then P3 and P5 got dancing games. they were great
[1:49:12] <+Joe2187> how are they playing this online?
[1:49:12] <%dds333a> @mister_menace09 tons of things
[1:49:14] <Buddha0991> this is a sequel that has more characters
[1:49:21] <zenith0111> Strikers is just a game design you give to your interns to make a few extra $$$
[1:49:23] <@Menitta> Plus I kinda wish it was just a regular musou. I still enjoyed that structure
[1:49:27] <%Shad0wTag> @menitta Oh yeah the first boss is a bug spike. The game wanted to grind levels before hand
[1:49:28] <%Irridium> @Joe2187 emulator and parsec
[1:49:34] <OblivionSword1> @Shad0wTag at least those two got released everywhere else
[1:49:34] <%CaptainPileDriver> @Menitta i've been playing it and man, that game does a FUCK ton of damage to you and like, what the hell do you expect me to do most of the time
[1:49:36] <Vendigear> @Joe2187 this is a PC emulator
[1:49:46] <+Joe2187> emulator for PS3?
[1:49:49] <thomasvalentine31> @mister_menace09 You get a continuation of the story, new boss/super versions of characters. shadow versions of all the characters, and more P3 cast members

[1:53:24] <Heefnoff> Trying to figure that out myself
[1:53:52] <+DatAsuna> @zenith0111 Besides being a P4 spinoff it's also the sequel to P4A's seperate story so you were double screwed lol
[1:54:04] <Heefnoff> The Chie mirror is wild
[1:54:14] <%townzzzzz> @WoolieVersus ggs guys
[1:54:19] <zenith0111> @datasuna The p3 characters is where I realized how out of depth I am
[1:54:38] <Heefnoff> But it's not reliable
[1:54:41] <Jonami90> I attempted right away, so I guess right at front?
[1:54:45] <%CaptainPileDriver> now whose gonna naoto it up and hit the other instant kill
[1:54:45] <@Menitta> Idk, it times out so you gotta reconnect
[1:54:48] <Heefnoff> Yeah idk

[2:07:48] <+FuqBoiSlim> it's not looking bear-y good for ol' Ted
[2:07:48] <Buddha0991> the big different one is naoto is also replaced in ultimax, og was in arena and is the battle voice in ultimax but old and new naoto sound pretty different so its a lot more noticable

[2:24:39] <%dds333a> The supernatural guides always turn out to be Superbosses in the Persona series, yeah

[2:26:42] <%dds333a> Although missing aerial options kinda hurts LUL
[2:26:44] <+DatAsuna> also in rare circumstance, aigis actually needs you to persona break her lol
[2:26:57] <Sonny_Firestorm> @DatAsuna Canonically speaking, the only guys who ever beat her were the P3 and P4 protags.

[2:29:39] <%Shad0wTag> @dds333a Ah when you don't remember anything you have no reason not to
[2:29:43] <YVector26> MAH WAIFU pogcha
[2:29:43] <+elderpunch> marie

[2:29:47] <GodGoshDarnIt> fucking Poochy.....
[2:29:48] <Buddha0991> its her, marie
[2:29:50] <%jinking79> oh shit Weather Report is coming LUL
[2:29:52] <DSD24> She has a cute hat
[2:29:52] <+softdeadline> kaguya is cool tho
[2:29:53] <+elderpunch> poorie
[2:29:55] <perfect_disaster> her design its too much
[2:29:56] <@Menitta> she really is poochie
[2:29:58] <%townzzzzz> LUL
[2:30:01] <+yeknomlive> here are some subsystems for you
[2:30:02] <%dds333a> Weather, whisper on em
[2:30:03] <%ChillaxingJay> better poochy
[2:30:04] <Buddha0991> im the only person who seems to like marie and her crappy poems lol
[2:30:05] <%CaptainPileDriver> tbf she's better than most of the girls in p4.
[2:30:06] <KingSpunf> I like Marie's character, but I can't stand her design
[2:30:09] <FlamingNarwhal> honestly, I don't mind Marie. she could be a LOT better but shes okay
[2:30:10] <%CaptainPileDriver> YEYEYEYE
[2:30:13] <Vendigear> I freakin' love Kaguya's design
[2:30:17] <@Menitta> Marie is fine but thats definitely what she is lol
[2:30:18] <+elderpunch> cool persona design tho
[2:30:21] <+yeknomlive> she has a weather gauge
[2:30:26] <0cash> amazing persona design
[2:30:28] <YVector26> @Buddha0991 Nah man, Marie gang PogChamp
[2:30:30] <@Menitta> P5R's poochie was way better
[2:30:32] <+elderpunch> i cant stand marie but i like her boss battle
[2:30:33] <+DatAsuna> There's a lot of attendants, like eveyr game has 2 now
[2:30:36] <%Tearonex> I'm so glad they chose Kaguya as her Persona
[2:30:37] <+Story_Ark> God I wish Chie would 234A me
[2:30:38] <%dds333a> she tells the weather Kappa
[2:30:38] <+FuqBoiSlim> Kaguya is raw fortunately. I wouldn't have bothered with that s link otherwise
[2:30:42] <Sonny_Firestorm> Marie is intrusive in Golden. If you like her it's great, but if you don't it's terrible.
[2:30:49] <+zeoroot> Still hope they add the bb netcode to this game at some point
[2:30:50] <+elderpunch> @Sonny_Firestorm yep
[2:30:53] <%dds333a> @datasuna and P2 had three LUL
[2:30:59] <%ChillaxingJay> @sonny_firestorm fair point
[2:31:01] <KingSpunf> Her bonus dungeon is also raw af
[2:31:10] <perfect_disaster> just remove one element in her design and thats it
[2:31:11] <%townzzzzz> OC THE OC
[2:31:11] <%dds333a> LUL LUL LUL
[2:31:13] <zepelinnn1> she's an optional Slink and optional dungeon, i cant remember her being intrusive
[2:31:15] <%jinking79> best Holy attack persona
[2:31:16] <Vendigear> YO
[2:31:21] <Heefnoff> @menitta If you ever want Yu tips I’m in the CSB discord
[2:31:26] <emper0rner0> That was hot haha
[2:31:31] <zenith0111> @zeoroot tbh they moght just be making P5A instead
[2:31:31] <+elderpunch> she started the whack ass trend of shoe horning characters into enhanced editions of Megaten games
[2:31:34] <Sonny_Firestorm> At least the P5 Royal girl has the common decency of buzzing off when she isn't necessary.
[2:31:35] <Heefnoff> :)
[2:31:35] <PizzicatoFive5> I don't think she's "intrusive" if you don't do anything in her route, which is pretty easy to ignore
[2:31:37] <@Menitta> @Heefnoff sick I;m there all the time
[2:31:39] <+DatAsuna> @dds333a P2 even had koneko, it was stacked xD
[2:31:41] <+Story_Ark> i dont mind tsunderes, but they made Marie too MUCH of a tsundere
[2:31:44] <Heefnoff> Nice!
[2:31:53] <%Shad0wTag> @woolieversus Reggie your right I should get back in I need a discord of folks to hang with
[2:31:55] <Ardisan_> @perfect_disaster Is it her eyes becaus thats what bothers me rlly
[2:31:58] <%ChillaxingJay> @story_ark true it was kinda annoying
[2:32:00] <Heefnoff> I’m still working on stuff as well, there’s still a ton of tech I can’t do
[2:32:01] <PizzicatoFive5> Kasumi was so fucking nothing tho
[2:32:02] <Vendigear> IK
[2:32:04] <FlamingNarwhal> i didnt really like Kasumi much. She felt really disconnected. Maruki was a better addition.
[2:32:09] <Vendigear> awww
[2:32:13] <+elderpunch> maruki gaoted
[2:32:15] <+yeknomlive> in jp she's vioced by kana hanazawa so she gets bonus points from me
[2:32:20] <waltzqueen> Maruki was Great
[2:32:20] <%Shad0wTag> @pizzicatofive5 Her boss design in her dungeon is soo cool though
[2:32:22] <GodGoshDarnIt> so just like i said: Persona starts AND ENDS in P3
[2:32:24] <@Menitta> Kasumi was great, but Royal executed her poorly
[2:32:29] <BlackermanZX> i forgot kasumi even existed for a sec
[2:32:29] <+Story_Ark> her design is hot tho
[2:32:34] <%townzzzzz> NICE POP SOUND
[2:32:36] <%Shad0wTag> @flamingnarwhal Sophie is a better new character she's adorable
[2:32:36] <Buddha0991> but persona 3 is the worst persona out of the 6 main games
[2:32:36] <Sonny_Firestorm> @FlamingNarwhal That's the thing: it was intentional, because you were dealing with a "fake" (when she shows her true self, she gits gud)
[2:32:43] <+elderpunch> kasumis story is literally just taken from the p1 manga lmaooo
[2:32:51] <perfect_disaster> @perfect_disaster lets remove her eyes then
[2:32:53] <%ChillaxingJay> @buddha0991 excuse me
[2:32:54] <%Shad0wTag> @godgoshdarnit Nah that's too negative for me
[2:33:00] <Ardisan_> p2 best and thats factual :)
[2:33:06] <FlamingNarwhal> @Shad0wTag true sophie is great
[2:33:07] <%CaptainPileDriver> insta kill?
[2:33:08] <+elderpunch> @Ardisan_ fax
[2:33:08] <%dds333a> @elderpunch every time I heard about the ideal and shit, I kept flash backing to P1 LUL
[2:33:08] <Vendigear> IKJ
[2:33:12] <Vendigear> GIVE US THE IK
[2:33:13] <+thedream_c> ewww Marie players
[2:33:16] <Heefnoff> Who hasn't gone yet?
[2:33:18] <@Menitta> If P2 is so good how come there's no P2-3 Kappa
[2:33:18] <+elderpunch> GET PUNISHED
[2:33:22] <%CaptainPileDriver> might as well have been
[2:33:23] <Heefnoff> Any other characters?
[2:33:23] <Kriss1827> ok but FemC tho.. shes great
[2:33:25] <Sonny_Firestorm> I would agree, IF I HAD P2. :<
[2:33:27] <%Shad0wTag> Like Sophie is a better new red haired characters
[2:33:41] <+Story_Ark> also the Persona 4 Golden anime made Marie even WORSE
[2:33:44] <%dds333a> @kriss1827 Kappa
[2:33:46] <+elderpunch> Lisa is the og ann tamamaki
[2:33:56] <+DatAsuna> even back in the day i could never pull off aigis' IK consistently lol
[2:33:58] <perfect_disaster> how heavy its that bag
[2:33:58] <ofalconer> Ceeeeasaaaaaaar!
[2:33:59] <Sonny_Firestorm> Golden anime in general was a mistake.
[2:34:05] <+elderpunch> p4g anime was a huge downgrade from the og p4 anime
[2:34:09] <+DatAsuna> @Menitta T_T
[2:34:10] <FlamingNarwhal> best part of the golden anime is the ramen girl
[2:34:12] <+Story_Ark> i liked the Culprit stuff in the p4g anime
[2:34:12] <yayohawk> woolieOMG
[2:34:15] <Buddha0991> as someone who likes marie, marie in the p4g anime was lame
[2:34:17] <Sonny_Firestorm> They decided to hire A-1 Pictures to do.
[2:34:20] <Sonny_Firestorm> Fucking why?
[2:34:22] <+brothernerofgc> how is the emulation on this?
[2:34:22] <%CaptainPileDriver> no one has picked the last velvet room attendant margaret
[2:34:22] <Heefnoff> She was in the regular p4 anime tho @FlamingNarwhal
[2:34:30] <GodGoshDarnIt> @Shad0wTag LUL i didnt touch anything P5 related, but P4 was pretty bad all and all
[2:34:30] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:34:32] <PizzicatoFive5> come on, the christmas date thing with Naoto was peak persona
[2:34:34] <+thedream_c> this UI is unbeaten even in modern standards
[2:34:37] <+DatAsuna> While P2 is my favourite, I must concede the two games have the golden sun problem even worse
[2:34:42] <GodGoshDarnIt> the Dancing game was good tho
[2:34:46] <FlamingNarwhal> @Heefnoff you know what thats true, i retract my statement
[2:34:46] <@Menitta> the P4 anime is great. Double the Chie.
[2:34:46] <Vendigear> rooBobble rooBobble rooBobble
[2:34:47] <%Shad0wTag> @sonny_firestorm cheaper and fast that's why
[2:34:50] <+DatAsuna> Where you switch protags, but the protags become silent.
[2:34:52] <Officialchourico> crazy that the re release of this is not getting a physical release in the west
[2:34:58] <+Story_Ark> p4d is fun. the story is stupid but fun
[2:35:01] <Vendigear> koefDance koefDance koefDance
[2:35:10] <+DatAsuna> Meaning you have 1 game of them mute and 1 game of them strongly characterised. lol
[2:35:14] <+elderpunch> the only thing i like about p4g storywise was the punished valentine dates
[2:35:14] <perfect_disaster> come on woolie
[2:35:20] <%Shad0wTag> @godgoshdarnit I've gathered talking about it with you then is pretty pointless if that's the casw
[2:35:22] <%dds333a> @datasuna sucked out all of Maya's personality, and it blows
[2:35:24] <Buddha0991> that really hurt
[2:35:30] <%CaptainPileDriver> insta kill for shits and giggles!
[2:35:37] <+kewlmyc> That really hurt!
[2:35:37] <Sonny_Firestorm> @elderpunch Yeah, but then P5 one upped the original Valentines Incident LUL
[2:35:41] <+Story_Ark> im also still upset that the p4 anime never did what the p5 anime did, which was animate the different valentines dates without having a canon onr
[2:35:41] <+DatAsuna> @dds333a "Let's positive thinking" internally
[2:35:44] <+elderpunch> they should always make u feel like a terrible person for dating multiple girls]
[2:35:48] <Vendigear> Marie has one of the best IKs, I wanna see it
[2:35:49] <mothdude> I really enjoyed the changes to the ending the Persona 4 anime made with Shadow Yu.
[2:35:55] <FlamingNarwhal> you think marie learned her bag fighting style from banjo and kazooie?
[2:36:01] <%Shad0wTag> @menitta Also some jokes are extra funny like Yu ignoring Yusuke in the trash can or the Neo Featherman figurw
[2:36:03] <+DatAsuna> @dds333a That said I'm still a sucker for EP Having an all adult cast
[2:36:04] <Sonny_Firestorm> @mothdude the regular P4 anime was great
[2:36:06] <+Story_Ark> the Yu vs Margaret fight in the anime was super cool
[2:36:11] <+kewlmyc> @elderpunch They never go far enough. Reverse and broken Slinks should come back.
[2:36:11] <%AkumaXDemon> you aint no air fighter mac
[2:36:14] <GodGoshDarnIt> @Shad0wTag LUL seems so
[2:36:14] <Sonny_Firestorm> It was  with Golden that they went astray
[2:36:15] <%Shad0wTag> @mothdude I LOVE THAT PART SO MUCH AT THE END
[2:36:18] <+elderpunch> @elderpunch eh, it was more comedic in 5. p4g deadass made me feel like im a pos
[2:36:21] <%dds333a> @datasuna I'm right there with you
[2:36:22] <+yeknomlive> oh yeah marg in this game is super cool

[2:44:59] <Sonny_Firestorm> Ah yeah, I couldn't stand BBtag cause I was too used to P4A for it.
[2:45:10] <zenith0111> BBtag had one cool mechanic and that is the tag system. everything else was just a gutted BB LUL
[2:45:12] <+Story_Ark> best girl wins
[2:45:18] <%Shad0wTag> @woolieversus All the RWBY characters got out fine in BBTAG cuz they were built for the game
[2:45:25] <Ardisan_> BBtag focus on the tag mechanic and not single characters
[2:45:33] <%dds333a> @shad0wtag exactly LUL
[2:45:44] <+Story_Ark> "chie-senpai has muscle" :)
[2:46:09] <+DatAsuna> I didn't even buy BBTAG cause I'm the kinda casual that buys fighting games for story mode lol
[2:46:26] <Sonny_Firestorm> @Shad0wTag Shame they forgot to actually put Yang and Blake in the base game. XD
[2:46:37] <AsinPersuasion> bbtag had some fun moments in the story
[2:46:40] <zenith0111> @datasuna So youre a figment of myth?
[2:46:47] <Ardisan_> BBTAG has a story mode

[2:47:31] <+DatAsuna> I do yeah
[2:47:39] <+FuqBoiSlim> Asuna's better than me. I end up buying FGs on sale just to dick around in training mode for 40 minutes then never touch it again.
[2:47:48] <Sonny_Firestorm> Like, RWBY stands for their initials. Ruby, Weiss, Blake, Yang
[2:47:55] <%Shad0wTag> Not sure how Arc sys then got massive slack for it

[3:05:45] <+thedream_c> IMO even niche rollback games will still need to be asking for matches
[3:05:47] <YVector26> Anybody got a link for the P4A Discord ?
[3:05:47] <%ChillaxingJay> LETS GO
[3:05:54] <+thedream_c> but at the very least your matchmaking will be BUTTERY smooth

[3:06:03] <+thedream_c> and that is the very least you can ask for in FG netplay
[3:06:06] <Vendigear> I wonder how the community will change after the port. Parsec will probably run better until they get rollback, and they have a modded version with more music and colors. bo8Hmm
[3:06:07] <marcomatame> wait this is on Parsec?
[3:06:09] <+FuqBoiSlim> aww

[3:21:05] <%jinking79> wat was he doing LUL
[3:21:06] <Buddha0991> people back then thought this was sho

[4:01:15] <%townzzzzz> FISTING
[4:01:17] <%dds333a> ONE TRICK
[4:01:18] <Vendigear> and pops like a balloon
[4:01:18] <Buddha0991> i remember that, chie, and mitsuru's circle attack all around her being hilariously strong
[4:01:23] <Sonny_Firestorm> @Buddha0991 Maybe, and that was a problem since his whole shtick is being competent but never shining cause there's always someone better.
[4:01:24] <perfect_disaster> LUL LUL
[4:01:38] <%dds333a> CHIE PLAYERS ONLY KNOW ONE INPUT
[4:01:39] <+elderpunch> @Vendigear ye, i used to play n practice w him for hours on my ps3
[4:01:48] <%Heefnoff> Wait are there no donation notifications on
[4:01:54] <+elderpunch> i actaully did learn combos and moves but its been years smhh
[4:02:17] <Vendigear> alright, who we maining, chat?
[4:02:18] <+FuqBoiSlim> woolie saves donations for the beginning and ending of streams
[4:02:25] <%Heefnoff> Ahhhh ok
[4:02:26] <%RyTYoung> @Shad0wTag yeah it's a no go it just freezes, could be my internet but I have fiber so who knows
[4:02:29] <Make_me_mad> @Vendigear Kanji, always.
[4:02:30] <%Heefnoff> My bad
[4:02:31] <%Shad0wTag> @heefnoff I believe they turned them off a while ago and reads them during beginning and ending of streams
[4:02:32] <+elderpunch> might learn junpei too
[4:02:36] <+DatAsuna> @Vendigear I play aigis, badly
[4:02:39] <Buddha0991> someone should main the shadow version of normal labrys, not shadow labrys, for kicks
[4:02:41] <%Heefnoff> Thanks for letting me know @Shad0wTag
[4:02:47] <%Shad0wTag> @rytyoung Xbox got a wired connection too?
[4:02:53] <perfect_disaster> reggie getting better
[4:02:53] <%Heefnoff> @Vendigear Honestly after today maybe Naoto lol
[4:03:01] <Vendigear> I'm torn between Labrys and Marie
[4:03:04] <%Heefnoff> Though Yu is my boy for sure
[4:03:12] <%Shad0wTag> @heefnoff No worries I believe this happened when the overlay was changed from the old one to the new one
[4:03:17] <%Heefnoff> Makes sense
[4:03:24] <%Heefnoff> I mean hey not like I'm going anywhere
[4:03:25] <@Menitta> I'm gonna switch to Mitsuru
[4:03:29] <%RyTYoung> @shad0wtag not wired either so that's also a factor why it's probably not keeping up
[4:03:31] <Buddha0991> i think back in the day people called shadow normal labrys shabrys and shadow labrys was s.lab or something like that
[4:03:33] <%Heefnoff> Mitsuru very good pick
[4:03:35] <@Menitta> big fan of those grapple moves
[4:03:36] <%Heefnoff> Especially in 2.0
[4:03:42] <Ardisan_> Which are the charge characters
[4:03:44] <+elderpunch> kanji too
[4:03:50] <%Shad0wTag> @vendigear Probably Liz or Minazuki
[4:03:50] <%Heefnoff> Mitsuru @Ardisan_
[4:03:50] <%redcoatna> only mit

[4:04:29] <Buddha0991> makes sense lol, why pick a weak version of a (sadly) meh character when shadow labrys herself is such a problem
[4:04:32] <%Heefnoff> Maybe I'll give Akihiko a try though, he seems really fun

[4:05:07] <Vendigear> Labrys' story was the one good part of these spinoffs' stories
[4:05:15] <perfect_disaster> I used to play a lot of kanji but then I saw a really good yusuke  so I decided to learn him
[4:05:33] <%Heefnoff> I just wish Yu still had his P4A vanilla stuff
[4:05:35] <%Shad0wTag> @vendigear I personally like how P3 cast was utilized
[4:05:38] <Buddha0991> labrys is amazing and i wanna see her again some day
[4:05:40] <%Heefnoff> He used to get oki from his 5D

[4:06:10] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:06:12] <%Heefnoff> Basically his sweep would keep the opponent knocked down, then you'd do 5D to make them wake up into Izanagi
[4:06:19] <%dds333a> we won't see one LUL
[4:06:19] <%Heefnoff> So you used to get really cheap oki

[4:10:29] <+DatAsuna> @Vendigear I like labrys backstory, but I don't really care about the present day yasogami high school bit lol
[4:10:31] <%Shad0wTag> @datasuna I have literally never used it to play any games minus SF5 once during a network test and that work so maybe I'd be okay?
