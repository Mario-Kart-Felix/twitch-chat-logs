[0:04:31] <MAGNUMB> when the number go up >>>>>>
[0:04:31] <+TheotherKristian> I want my first GPU to be the 3070 =)
[0:04:39] <el_biribon> the neighbor's car is SLIGHTLY better THO!
[0:04:49] <ScandalousSam262> woolie judging reggie's spending decisions like he didnt choose to buy marvel 3 over a threeway KappaPride KappaPride KappaPride
[0:04:51] <%Proxzo> It's more the price difference
[0:04:53] <%gatorafan> At this point you might as well wait for the next thing right?
[0:05:05] <CrematedCube> Since I like to cobble together stuff from cheap parts, this is great news to me
[0:05:05] <SomersaultJustice> it's wolly time
[0:05:06] <+Kyoshikei> imma upgrade my 970 to a 3070
[0:05:07] <+jiggy_snipe> nope it's been invalidated
[0:05:10] <%Proxzo> It's not valid. you're paying more for less
[0:05:11] <%doomerskeletor13> Reggie has his own goblins now
[0:05:12] <+skyheys> No it isn't. it's a TERRIBLE DECISION
[0:05:13] <%SirGO0SE> as someone whos built close to a dozen machines, buying the new card right now is the dumbest thing you can do lol
[0:05:15] <CookieCutter007> rtx 3080 is like 60-80 better than 2080ti bois
[0:05:15] <%Solidnick18> lol
[0:05:16] <Lancaster_H> Woolie you bought the cube and ANOTHER Steam controller, shut up LUL
[0:05:20] <%Irridium> if you decide to wait for the next thing you'll just be waiting in perpetuity
[0:05:20] <%BallerSwagBro9k> JUST BUY THE 3090 REGGIE
[0:05:22] <ShinobiPhoenix> Marvel 3 is better than a 3way, get over it. #Overrated
[0:05:22] <CrematedCube> Everyone ditching their old GOOD stuff
[0:05:27] <%chosenjuan42> WOOLIE woolieVS Pit of 100 Trials
[0:05:28] <%SirGO0SE> your current card will last you literally 6 years without you giving a shit
[0:05:28] <%doomerskeletor13> woolieKICKDAD woolieKICKDAD woolieKICKDAD woolieKICKDAD woolieKICKDAD
[0:05:30] <%RioGascar> okay reggie even if you want the 3000 line. WAIT FOR REVIEWS from like digital foundry and linus and gamers nexus and shit. CAUSE ITS POSSIBLE THE 3000 line SUCKS
[0:05:32] <%Proxzo> 3080 is valid
[0:05:36] <%doomerskeletor13> Woolie Vs FOMO
[0:05:40] <Polarix64> @ShinobiPhoenix You're right
[0:05:43] <%Proxzo> That's true.
[0:05:44] <el_biribon> what if they picked blastoise and ur stuck with charizard. might as well buy a new pokemon cart
[0:05:45] <%ringabal> BUT MMMMMMMMM MEEEEEEEEEE
[0:05:47] <+skyheys> Woolie is wrong
[0:05:47] <%kyh9> 3080 is the new one
[0:05:51] <+linSP> dew it Reggie, join the dark side
[0:06:01] <%Solidnick18> lol
[0:06:01] <+jiggy_snipe> SEE THOSE stats are nuts
[0:06:05] <%KineKithZen> Wait for actual real-world performance benchmarks instead of hype
[0:06:06] <+MrAsmoday> Digital Foundry already looked at it and said it was legit
[0:06:07] <%Proxzo> You can build a 2nd PC.
[0:06:14] <CrematedCube> I'm currently on a computer from 2010
[0:06:21] <%cobalt_phoenix_> Reggie wait to make sure it's worth it, then sell it to someone who can't afford the 3080 but still wants to upgrade, at the very least you minimize the loss and someone gets an upgrade
[0:06:25] <%YakumoYomi> I was looking to upgrade my RX580, so I'm eyeing that sexy 3070.
[0:06:30] <MAGNUMB> digital foundry did a hands on with the 3080, it’s legit
[0:06:32] <%nxflre> yo thats a sick ARMS shirt
[0:06:34] <%SirGO0SE> while the timing could have been better, it doesnt invalidate that your choice is still good man
[0:06:37] <@Commando_Joe> Woolie is giving Reggie the: Shit happens, move on
[0:06:42] <%ChoculaUltra> kinda wanna wait for the 3070 but if the gods will that I land a 3090 preorder I won't be adverse to it either.
[0:06:45] <@akuda_bar> couldn't you return it? it's been too soon for it to not be returnable
[0:06:49] <%nxflre> ARMS Waifu shirt
[0:06:53] <%KineKithZen> Digital Foundry's hands-on was done with a specific set of drivers and applications optimized for in advance by nvidia
[0:06:56] <@Solidus_113> "don't buy parts yet, the new ones are just around the corner" -Everyone talking about PC parts ever
[0:06:58] <%KineKithZen> It does not reflect real life
[0:06:59] <@akuda_bar> rip
[0:07:10] <%DatAsuna> yo reggie sell me your 2080
[0:07:16] <el_biribon> Woolie is thinking too hard, dont think consume product
[0:07:21] <CookieCutter007> LUL the 2080ti is selling for 500 on ebay
[0:07:24] <%SirGO0SE> reggie do a fucking stream before getting a second machine
[0:07:30] <+skyheys> @solidus_113 usually the new one is comparable or more expensive
[0:07:33] <%SirGO0SE> dont even play with that idea
[0:07:38] <%SirGO0SE> until you have been streaming lol
[0:07:39] <%DatAsuna> Reggie I will trade you a bike for that 2080
[0:07:46] <ShinobiPhoenix> There is LITERALLY an Onion video about the next PC coming out as you buy a PC
[0:07:51] <el_biribon> chat he said futureproof, abort, ABORT
[0:07:56] <+jiggy_snipe> buy it all at once around the holidays
[0:08:06] <+jiggy_snipe> like around black friday to christmas
[0:08:11] <Lancaster_H> unless you found some sick deals, yeah
[0:08:15] <%iHum4n> There's no point in buying computer parts if you can't use them
[0:08:21] <@akuda_bar> there's a benefit if you luck into a sale within a few weeks but i wouldn't do that over a time spanning longer than a month or so lol
[0:08:23] <ScandalousSam262> i think just as a rule of thumb, never buy a pc ever because it will only lead to disappointment
[0:08:28] <%ringabal> Light (Optimization) Later
[0:08:36] <+sinistersally> Instead of buying a piece, set that money aside as if you bought it.
[0:08:37] <%doomerskeletor13> Console master race Kappa
[0:08:38] <%SirGO0SE> it gives you a chance to break it early and not buy the cheaper better OC units later
[0:08:41] <%Irridium> but woolie NEW THING MUST BUY
[0:08:42] <%chosenjuan42> Mario collection makes me happy but also salty that TTYD is stuck in the GameCube
[0:08:45] <el_biribon> it will only become cheaper with time reggie
[0:08:49] <%nxflre> is Woolie's mic low for anyone else?
[0:08:49] <CrematedCube> "There's no faster speedup than when it first runs"
[0:08:51] <townzzzzz> if it can run DOOM you're set for life
[0:08:54] <%glass_marcus> Reggie playing footsies with the Tech Market
[0:08:59] <+MrAsmoday> I agree but only if you can afford to do it all at once
[0:09:06] <%chosenjuan42> Woolies mic is fine
[0:09:11] <ShinobiPhoenix> @chosenjuan42 Nintendo didn't even acknowleddge Galaxy II!
[0:09:19] <%kyh9> Be nice to Reggie
[0:09:19] <@Solidus_113> I haven't upgraded a single part in my PC since building it on 2013
[0:09:25] <Mr_Strut> There is always a party you will be late for
[0:09:27] <+Ancopro> plays halo 1 this year
[0:09:36] <gluemanofficial> @nxflre It looks like it's in the same place it always is
[0:09:40] <@akuda_bar> i got a 2080 last year but then again i haven't been like "wow what a slow graphics card" ever at all since i got it so
[0:09:40] <MAGNUMB> fwiw the 3000 line will have very few units at launch, prolly won’t be able to get it for a while outside of a lucky preorder
[0:09:40] <%doomerskeletor13> I need to relay Doom Eternal before the DLC comes out so I’m not rusty
[0:09:46] <bryxobryx> They didnt acknowledge the lost levels either whats your point
[0:09:47] <CrematedCube> It's a little quiet to me
[0:09:55] <Lancaster_H> every PC player goes through this video card bullshit at least once Reg it's fine it's part of the process
[0:09:58] <%Proxzo> Yo, in a year you can upgrade to a discounted 3080.
[0:09:58] <+skyheys> I would agree with Woolie if Reggie didnt essentially lose $500 on nada. I buy consoles a generation late and use cheap pc parts :U
[0:10:01] <%SirGO0SE> @akuda_bar same, and we wont feel that way for 3-4 years at least lol
[0:10:07] <%YakumoYomi> @Solidus_113 The time has come. Build a beastly PC with new parts, and use your current one with it in a two-PC streaming setup
[0:10:26] <el_biribon> individual parts is always better but it requires a lot of homework
[0:10:26] <@Solidus_113> I don't have money for that dude
[0:10:27] <+skyheys> @proxzo
[0:10:30] <+skyheys> yes
[0:10:33] <%nxflre> yeah guess my speakers are lame, switching to headphones
[0:10:34] <Mr_Strut> Yeah, you don't want to buy piecemeal
[0:10:36] <@Solidus_113> My GPU is still a GTX 460
[0:10:36] <%SirGO0SE> you really didnt tho
[0:10:40] <%SirGO0SE> you just think you did
[0:10:42] <%KyoryUtchy> @bryxobryx Just for the record they DID acknowledge the lost levels.
[0:10:46] <@akuda_bar> you could keep your old pc and use it for smart things, or you could treat it like shit so that it doesn't run when you're done with it like a Smart Person BibleThump
[0:10:46] <+jiggy_snipe> I feel like buying individually always backfires
[0:10:49] <%KineKithZen> I'll send you my 2080 Ti so you can run it in SLI, Reggie Kappa
[0:10:50] <%doomerskeletor13> You’re fine Reggie it’s just the mind goblins!
[0:10:53] <%Proxzo> Boxing Day prices will be good.

[0:11:16] <%kyh9> But it's never forever, it's every 2 years
[0:11:17] <@akuda_bar> people were telling me that a whole ass year ago though. people say that every year
[0:11:20] <Mr_Strut> A learning experience
[0:11:24] <%Irridium> new ones are ALWAYS around the corner
[0:11:24] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1300611368941428737?s=19
[0:11:29] <@Solidus_113> ALWAYS
[0:11:32] <+skyheys> @akuda_bar Yeah, this year is exceptional
[0:11:36] <CrematedCube> Computer are super vulnerable to mind goblins
[0:11:37] <%Proxzo> It's okay, you'll get the better cards in like 6 months.
[0:11:37] <el_biribon> dont feel bad reggie, it could've been JUAN GAI
[0:11:38] <Lancaster_H> the lesson here is chat is always right Kappa
[0:11:43] <+sinistersally> That advice could always be aplicable every 3 month
[0:11:45] <+skyheys> usually that's Bad advice
[0:11:45] <%YakumoYomi> I was ready to pull the trigger on an RX 5700XT, so this new gen from Nvidia hit at the right time for me
[0:11:45] <@akuda_bar> @skyheys a stopped clock
[0:11:47] <MAGNUMB> i told someone four days ago to wait for sept and they didn’t listen lmao
[0:11:48] <%ChoculaUltra> gamers rise up 2020 but for realsies this time?
[0:11:54] <+Kyoshikei> All I do is watch Gamers Nexus, Linus and JayzTwoCents and they literally were saying WAIT
[0:11:59] <+skyheys> @akuda_bar Exactly, reggie got screwed by fate
[0:12:00] <%KineKithZen> Graphics cards stagnated pretty hardcore for several years before this, so a purported leap like this again is novel
[0:12:00] <CookieCutter007> the stock is going to be empty in the first second LUL
[0:12:04] <%Proxzo> Wait a while, they'll release revisions.
[0:12:05] <+jiggy_snipe> nope the reviews are great
[0:12:05] <BlackermanZX> and also it doesnt mean you will get it inmediately
[0:12:12] <+sinistersally> In 3 month they'll roll out 3080 super
[0:12:30] <ShinobiPhoenix> @bryxobryx Yes they did, they reminded people it's available on the SNES Online already AND it will be in Super Mario All-Stars AND they showed it in the montage. Left out Galaxy II and 6 Golden Coins. 3D All-Stars should have Galaxy II.
[0:12:31] <%Proxzo> @sinistersally then the 3080 base will lower the price.
[0:12:33] <%ChoculaUltra> here I was thinking the 3000 series would be pushed back cuz of covid and what not. Boy do I feel dumb
[0:12:36] <%Lion_kun> Listen to this rich guy, it's just 600 dollars
[0:12:38] <%doomerskeletor13> Reggie woolieVS FOMO
[0:12:39] <%SirGO0SE> you can beat yourself up the FIRST time you cant play a game, and that is going to be probably twice as long as youre thinking now
[0:12:43] <+jiggy_snipe> look, don't spend your money unless you plan on using your computer right now
[0:12:52] <+Lazy_Vagabond> is the audio really low?
[0:13:03] <+linSP> is the new card really under 1k?
[0:13:05] <%ChoculaUltra> the real problem are the crypto assholes copping like 30 cards each to farm whatever they're farming.
[0:13:17] <%kyh9> But you should know when the new tech comes out
[0:13:17] <+sinistersally> @Proxzo not by much, maybe 50 bucks then several month down 100 but a new set will roll out.
[0:13:17] <%SirGO0SE> the trigger MUST be pulled
[0:13:18] <%BallerSwagBro9k> JUST BUY AGAIN. CONSUME PRODUCT
[0:13:18] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @ChoculaUltra oh fuck those guys
[0:13:19] <@Solidus_113> I haven't seen a 1080p game in 5 years
[0:13:20] <%nxflre> MArio 3D All STars is going for FOMO
[0:13:23] <CrematedCube> I can't believe what this 10-yr-old comp can run
[0:13:23] <banirakohi> woolie are you a flurry kinda man
[0:13:23] <arkv01> reggie, the 2080 is fine
[0:13:26] <penitentpentwitch> Ignore FOMO! Embrace ROMO (Resigned On Missing Out)!
[0:13:32] <Lancaster_H> woolie this is literal objective improvement though, not FOMO
[0:13:32] <+linSP> fomo fighters z
[0:13:40] <%ChoculaUltra> @cobalt_phoenix_ literally the worst thing to happen to pc gaming in a very long time. Fuck those guys passionately.
[0:13:41] <%KineKithZen> I am not convinced that the air-cooled versions won't throttle like hell with one intake fan. Waiting for liquid/hybrid
[0:13:42] <%FuqBoiSlim> Mario FOMO All-Stars DansGame
[0:13:52] <+jiggy_snipe> well Reggie how much did you spend on the 2080 is the real question
[0:13:54] <BlackermanZX> dang it im gonna miss this session doodSad
[0:13:54] <%Proxzo> hows the 2nd hand market for cards?
[0:13:56] <%yusefHD> Mario 3D All Stars Battle Royale With Cheese
[0:13:59] <Kongro_> hello boys, you're looking cute today
[0:14:01] <Kongro_> you too chat
[0:14:07] <dreadedcthulhu> woolie labbing out the anti-peak tech
[0:14:15] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @ChoculaUltra yeah i was lucky to build my pc just before that started happening
[0:14:16] <el_biribon> Reggie is too pure for PC gaming

[0:14:35] <ShinobiPhoenix> Mario Battle Royale is going to be problematic and awesome, but why is there a time limit on it
[0:14:39] <%BallerSwagBro9k> WOLLIE IS RIGHT/WRONG
[0:14:41] <%SirGO0SE> and understands the situation
[0:14:48] <%FuqBoiSlim> WHICH//ONE
[0:14:49] <CrematedCube> People are different
[0:14:50] <%BallerSwagBro9k> DEFY REALITY
[0:14:57] <BlackermanZX> Woolie is Wright doodDerp
[0:14:57] <+linSP> UNIVERSAL TRUTHS

[0:15:30] <+skyheys> but feelings are all chat has
[0:15:31] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[0:15:37] <Leafboi125> Just consume product
[0:15:41] <%ringabal> TOO MUCH BIT
[0:15:42] <%doomerskeletor13> Reject reality and substitute your own, Alan Wake style
[0:15:44] <%RioGascar> here is also a thing to think about. higher specs and parts often are not as tested on pc ports for a game and when you DO RUN INTO problems the amount of people who actually have the cards to test the issue and solve it is MUCH SMALLER
[0:15:59] <+Kyoshikei> back up pc
[0:16:02] <Ryutaryi> That Mario collection is so goddamn disappointing.
[0:16:08] <%DatAsuna> Also you can absolutely resell the 2080
[0:16:11] <%yusefHD> @Ryutaryi HOW?
[0:16:15] <%SirGO0SE> dont even think about 2nd card until youve done a couple months of streams my dude
[0:16:20] <%DatAsuna> There's plenty of demand for not cutting edge cards dude
[0:16:30] <@Solidus_113> Max has multiple PCs, but he has actual daily use for them
[0:16:33] <Leafboi125> I'm a little sad no Galaxy 2
[0:16:37] <+skyheys> Not in 2 years :U
[0:16:38] <el_biribon> he thinkin
[0:16:39] <%DatAsuna> You don't have to worry about nobody buying a 2080 on fb market or ebay
[0:16:42] <+sinistersally> If you really want a 3080 sell the 2080 to a friend. help someone out and get some money toward to the 3080
[0:16:44] <+skyheys> fuckin pcs
[0:16:46] <Ryutaryi> @yusefHD No Galaxy 2 and only available for six months. It's dumb
[0:16:47] <%RioGascar> way far
[0:16:50] <Lancaster_H> Do you intend to play Cyberpunk in 4k
[0:16:50] <@akuda_bar> 8k monitors don't even like. exist
[0:16:51] <%xXjuffelXx> xXjuffelXx subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! Keep the good work guys
[0:16:51] <BlackermanZX> 8k is just unnecesary
[0:16:52] <el_biribon> BIG NUMBER
[0:16:52] <%Solidnick18> lol
[0:16:56] <Mr_Strut> Reggie got the computer lust
[0:16:58] <$Spydurman> LUL
[0:16:59] <CrematedCube> I'm personally celebrating the incoming wave of cheap hand-me-downs
[0:16:59] <Leafboi125> 8K
[0:17:06] <%BallerSwagBro9k> 8K TETRIS
[0:17:09] <%kyh9> ITS EVERY TWO YEARS NEW CARDS COME OUT
[0:17:09] <@Solidus_113> What kind of monitor does Reggie have? Is it still only 60hz?
[0:17:09] <$Spydurman> GET IN REGGIE YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO
[0:17:12] <%doomerskeletor13> 8K FEET
[0:17:18] <%M3djedx> woolieYE
[0:17:18] <el_biribon> Reggie do you even have an 8K monitor?
[0:17:19] <%Solidnick18> sure
[0:17:24] <@akuda_bar> upload it in 8K like a fucking god
[0:17:24] <%doomerskeletor13> woolieKICKDAD woolieKICKDAD woolieKICKDAD woolieKICKDAD
[0:17:25] <$Spydurman> 8K FEET
[0:17:26] <+skyheys> Future proofing BAD, NO 8K FEET
[0:17:27] <%yusefHD> @Ryutaryi Fair enough ~
[0:17:30] <dreadedcthulhu> let's all go hang out at reggie's place
[0:17:31] <+TrevSmith222> Bring Your Own Mask
[0:17:35] <el_biribon> 8K feet pics
[0:17:38] <%Lion_kun> BUT ITS 8K WOOLIE
[0:17:42] <Leafboi125> 8K FEET
[0:17:43] <@Squdnate> Youtube does suppoert 8K now @WoolieVersus
[0:17:46] <%yusefHD> What about twitch streaming 120fps? PogChamp
[0:17:46] <penitentpentwitch> ...so what you're saying is Reggie needs a bigger Hard Drive?
[0:17:47] <Mr_Strut> But big number
[0:17:47] <+Kyma1020> 2080 Super is still a good card. Give it a year or two for the new tech to work out the kinks and buy the new one.
[0:17:50] <$Spydurman> BUT 8K FEET WOOLIE
[0:17:53] <%Proxzo> 2080 is fine
[0:17:54] <BlackermanZX> who the fuck actually wants 8K
[0:17:55] <%BallerSwagBro9k> BUT MORE POWER THO
[0:17:56] <%ringabal> This is some Pat logic
[0:17:57] <$Spydurman> Reggie will
[0:17:58] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[0:17:58] <%nxflre> 8k monitors fuck that cost
[0:18:01] <Lancaster_H> 8k smooth silky 30 fps
[0:18:01] <ShinobiPhoenix> @Ryutaryi Why is it disappointing? Aside from Galaxy II, what 3D games is it missing?
[0:18:02] <+skyheys> People in 3 years
[0:18:02] <@akuda_bar> reggie can upload it there in 8k so he can watch it in 8k alone
[0:18:05] <+Kyma1020> This is some BIG Pat Goblins
[0:18:09] <%kyh9> Me, in Reggie's House
[0:18:10] <%Lion_kun> BUT ITS 8K THO
[0:18:14] <%RioGascar> what games will EVEN SUPPORT 8K??? like cyberpunk 2077 AND WHAT ELSE????
[0:18:16] <dreadedcthulhu> 8k fake and unnecessary number inflation
[0:18:16] <$Spydurman> if Reggie sees it in 8K isn't that all that matters?
[0:18:20] <%nxflre> 8k MONITOR PRICE THO
[0:18:26] <%yusefHD> Think of how clear the menus will be though woolieSHOOK
[0:18:26] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:18:28] <CrematedCube> I'd rather be sane and have money
[0:18:28] <el_biribon> this is just confirmation that reggie is straight up non-asshole pat
[0:18:28] <alrobot2014> do the big porns even support 8k yet?
[0:18:34] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @Kyma1020 Pat wants the 3090 tho just because of bigger nymber
[0:18:53] <penitentpentwitch> I waited for Control to come out on Steam, didn't regret it
[0:18:58] <+skyheys> You don't spend 1000 dollars on the delayed game tho LUL
[0:19:00] <Ryutaryi> @Ryutaryi It's not missing anything but Galaxy 2, but the limited availability irks me so much. Makes it not worth it tbh
[0:19:04] <Rhinoprotoss> Is this just about Pat?
[0:19:06] <el_biribon> you already KNOW the podcast this week is gonna be good just on the 2h of pat sounding like a maniac over big number
[0:19:11] <%chosenjuan42> I hope he did not do Pit off screen
[0:19:17] <+skyheys> @el_biribon LUL
[0:19:20] <reasonance> feel like a boomer over here with my 720p shit already
[0:19:21] <%SirGO0SE> theres no reason to give a shit about new cards until your current card cant do a thing.
[0:19:29] <%BallerSwagBro9k> MUST CONSUME WOOLIE
[0:19:30] <%DatAsuna> It's almost like mind goblins make people unhappy regardless of what hey actually have
[0:19:33] <@akuda_bar> what if i like emotional journies
[0:19:36] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @el_biribon so the usual podcast Kappa
[0:19:41] <el_biribon> true
[0:19:42] <%ringabal> No one tell Woolie about the PS5 First Wave Preorders
[0:19:51] <+skyheys> @akuda_bar you'll like Paper mario
[0:19:52] <$Spydurman> Reggie get the card, ignore Woolie's naysaying!
[0:19:55] <majindusto> FOMO
[0:19:57] <MKII> but it looks sick as fuck
[0:19:58] <@akuda_bar> @skyheys i do!!
[0:19:59] <CrematedCube> Envy is a helluva emotion

[0:20:07] <RunoEddie> Keep Your Hype In Check, Always
[0:20:08] <%Solidnick18> what matters is what you got now.
[0:20:09] <gluemanofficial> Its easy. You just go into every situation already angry, and then you can be angry about anything
[0:20:13] <+jiggy_snipe> Woolie, price is the main reason tho lol

[0:21:26] <%YakumoYomi> @ShinobiPhoenix Are you sure? The wording they used seemed to imply otherwise.
[0:21:27] <%Irridium> invest in the auto-blow 5000
[0:21:28] <@akuda_bar> ok old man
[0:21:32] <Ryutaryi> @Ryutaryi It is, though. Nintendo specifically says that both physical and digital stop being on sale at the end of March

[0:22:08] <ShinobiPhoenix> @ringabal there's no PS5 Launch Day games to want to own it so early... people are silly. Without PS3 games and not telling us which PS4 games we can play THAT WE OWN, I have completely 180'd on PS5.
[0:22:09] <Mr_Strut> Just remember, never invest what you can't afford, and always assume your money is gone

[0:23:12] <%cobalt_phoenix_> i look forward to future streams where woolie gives us stock market tech
[0:23:13] <ShinobiPhoenix> @YakumoYomi they said Limited Physical Release (common) and Digital will be available on *insert date*

[0:24:59] <%KaitlynnHere> No it’s not that great, it’s 20%
[0:25:00] <%kyh9> @SirGO0SE For sure. Crypto volatility is so high that you can end up with an extra $10000 by accident
[0:25:03] <%RioGascar> @akuda_bar i think 8yr old me would probably end up tanking a companys stocks

[0:25:33] <%Akizea> lol 3070's are affordable as fuck tbh
[0:25:34] <flowdere> dual wield 3070's
[0:25:34] <Memdosu> but what about the 8k
[0:25:35] <+solzan2000> 2080 is more than enough
[0:25:40] <%RioGascar> i use the 1070 ti for VR
[0:25:41] <%yusefHD> @KaitlynnHere F
[0:25:42] <Lancaster_H> but the number
[0:25:45] <+AbnormalVoid> I'm still using a 970 lmao
[0:25:45] <%YakumoYomi> @ShinobiPhoenix The eShop page for All Stars says "available as a limited run retail edition and digital edition that is available for a limited time until the end of March 2021"
[0:25:46] <+jiggy_snipe> naw bro you got a bad deal
[0:25:47] <%doomerskeletor13> We gotta cure these Reggie goblins
[0:25:47] <Parapattern> IT big
[0:25:48] <%cobalt_phoenix_> the NUMBER
[0:25:49] <CrematedCube> @ZComiX We're nearing the endgame of Paper Mario
[0:25:51] <%RioGascar> but i want...RTX MAN I GOTTA HAVE IT
[0:25:53] <+skyheys> he still got fucked. it's a shame
[0:25:55] <flowdere> 3070 gonna be like 3 grand when people resell
[0:25:56] <Ryutaryi> I wonder who that could be
[0:25:57] <RunoEddie> something new is always coming out
[0:25:57] <%Solidnick18> like pat
[0:25:59] <Parapattern> The BIG tho
[0:26:01] <Memdosu> BIG NUMBER MATTERS
[0:26:06] <CookieCutter007> Mr Pat with his 3090
[0:26:16] <+linSP> going from 1070 to 3070, the upgrade is real
[0:26:18] <Unimpressions> This is the 2nd generation
[0:26:27] <%KaitlynnHere> @cookiecutter007 damn, already?

[0:26:37] <@Squdnate> @WoolieVersus This is the 2nd generation
[0:26:39] <Unimpressions> the RTX 2000 series was the first for this tech, wasn't it?
[0:26:43] <CookieCutter007> nah @KaitlynnHere
[0:26:44] <@Squdnate> 2000 series was 1st gen
[0:26:51] <%RioGascar> wait for those benchmarks
[0:26:55] <%BallerSwagBro9k> What about the 1000s?
[0:27:00] <CookieCutter007> the 2000 series felt like a glorified beta test
[0:27:02] <ShinobiPhoenix> OK, I read the description on the OTHER Super Mario 3D All Stars announcement video, so I see now. the description is much more clear than the human announcer speaking. That is really weird. Why make the game itself limited release? I mean it will be easy to buy if you want it, but why limit it suddenly?
[0:27:04] <%KaitlynnHere> Hoooooollld
[0:27:06] <+sinistersally> ... later on laugh at Pat
[0:27:16] <%Double_Tap_That> Why is the stream so quiet? My speakers are maxed out and it's still low.
[0:27:22] <Sielas> If you're looking at the 3000 series before benchmarks you're literally just trusting advertisements
[0:27:25] <+jiggy_snipe> he reset the mics
[0:27:26] <Lancaster_H> booooooo
[0:27:28] <%yusefHD> HURT. JOHNNY CASH. Damn it.
[0:27:35] <RunoEddie> I'm trying to hold off on building a new PC until next year, but if my rig breaks, I'll just have to do it immediately, them's the breaks

[0:27:48] <%velemi> GIGASHIT
[0:27:57] <Ryutaryi> Still using the 1050Ti and I've been good for years
[0:27:59] <%BallerSwagBro9k> 1O GIGASHIT OF DATA
[0:28:08] <%DatAsuna> I still run new games on a 970 just fine
[0:28:09] <+linSP> Give me the gigashit
[0:28:26] <+jiggy_snipe> naw don't do that
[0:28:30] <+jiggy_snipe> just keep it
[0:28:33] <%ringabal> Paper Mario doesn't need computer parts. Everything's made of cardboard.
[0:28:33] <%ChoculaUltra> the next series of cards better have smell-o-vision. Tired of this non-smell based gameplay.
[0:28:37] <%DatAsuna> you can scalp closer to the cost than that
[0:28:38] <%kyh9> Sure
[0:28:42] <ShinobiPhoenix> but limited run DIGITAL release is like unheard
[0:28:42] <@akuda_bar> you won't notice the difference until 5 years from now anyway
[0:28:49] <+skyheys> this is reasonable
[0:28:49] <MKII> big jumps tend to come every other gen for Nvidia but the 2xxx line was not one of those I believe
[0:28:52] <%DatAsuna> What I'm hearing is that if I need to run a scam in the future, target reggie
[0:28:55] <RunoEddie> just keep it, upgrade in the future, you're fine for now

[0:47:31] <%doomerskeletor13> The crowd in this battle is like the chat during Halo Kappa
[0:47:39] <Mr_Strut> Maybe dodgy fog again?
[0:47:45] <Mr_Strut> Or the shell
[0:47:54] <%Euphbugg> Flurrie shield
[0:47:57] <GenericSoda> burning
[0:47:57] <%chosenjuan42> choose meat shield
[0:48:00] <BrazillianCara> Oh gosh they removed Quick Change.
[0:48:07] <%HollowedIdjit> Bobbery Timebombs or Counter?
[0:48:12] <%ozmon> Goombella was already busy being frozen, so she lost her turn
[0:48:13] <ShiningAxis> they didn't, partner loses turn on freeze
[0:48:20] <Drusain> He has quick change, but the ice cost the turn
[0:48:24] <%thekrawler> freeze is wack
[0:48:25] <%DatAsuna> woolie's combat variety has kinda fallen off a cliff lately
[0:48:26] <%chosenjuan42> POWER PUNCH
[0:48:27] <%Euphbugg> @BrazillianCara no they have quick still but partner lost a turn from Goombella being frozen
[0:48:27] <Mr_Strut> Repel cape is good
[0:48:27] <BrazillianCara> Oh, I see.
[0:48:45] <%M3djedx> umbraThink umbraThink
[0:49:04] <%ozmon> The endgame, where Power Bounce becomes Mario
[0:49:09] <%ozmon> 's standard attack
[0:49:20] <%chosenjuan42> he will attack twice remember
[0:49:24] <Polarix64> Use Goombella for Rally Wink Heal and Attack
[0:49:36] <%thekrawler> goombella frozen my guy
[0:49:43] <%nxflre> goombella still frozen
[0:49:50] <Polarix64> Oh Goombella is still frozen fuck
[0:49:57] <+StrawberryPantsu> Remember:It's a DPS race. He'll recover once he's low hp

[0:50:59] <%JD_Lars> Appeal?
[0:50:59] <CastellanVon> PURE SKILL
[0:51:00] <%velemi> TURN LOST
[0:51:03] <+StrawberryPantsu> DPS RACE
[0:51:05] <+jiggy_snipe> LOL
[0:51:06] <%cobalt_phoenix_> eh only 20
[0:51:06] <Papa_Bearman> Don't bone enemies take more damage from fire?
[0:51:10] <cosmicgoatee> his regen is a free round
[0:51:14] <%Seancicle> 🤫
[0:51:15] <ShiningAxis> build up that star power
[0:51:17] <%thekrawler> buffs don't go away or count down when the partner isn't out in the battle, so you can store buffs and debuffs for more strategy
[0:51:22] <%cobalt_phoenix_> legendary action
[0:51:22] <penitentpentwitch> Leave her out, you keep wasting turns switching back to her
[0:51:24] <%yusefHD> Bobbery big damage, or restore FP
[0:51:29] <+RocketBarrel> Why is Hammer Grey'd out?
[0:51:31] <Polarix64> Does he heal multiple times or just once?
[0:51:36] <+i_heart_gaming> Doesn't bobbery have those small bombs
[0:51:40] <+i_heart_gaming> do they work?
[0:51:41] <+jiggy_snipe> I don't think Woolie uses turns switching cuz of a badge
[0:51:42] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @RocketBarrel jumpan badge
[0:51:44] <%velemi> @RocketBarrel he is using the Jumpman badge
[0:51:44] <ShiningAxis> jumpman badge
[0:51:44] <%yusefHD> LEND WOOLIE YOUR ENERGY
[0:51:46] <%chosenjuan42> let her thaw?
[0:51:48] <%Euphbugg> @RocketBarrel he has jumpman on, which increases jump dmg but no hammer
[0:51:51] <Papa_Bearman> @RocketBarrel He has the Jumpman badge equipped.
[0:51:53] <+RocketBarrel> Ah ok
[0:52:02] <+regis_j_rock> Sweet Treat thaws I think
[0:52:04] <thepatkelly> Appeal and hide
[0:52:15] <Polarix64> Does Bonetail heal every time he has low hp or just once?
[0:52:20] <+regis_j_rock> Appeal bad rn
[0:52:20] <Papa_Bearman> Sweet Treat cures poison, but I don't think it thaws.
[0:52:34] <getstickbugged_lol> Squid3
[0:52:40] <%chosenjuan42> you got big audience
[0:52:44] <+regis_j_rock> @papa_bearman I know a lot of times when the game says Poison it means every status
[0:52:45] <Thunderhog> You'd probably lose on the DPS race
[0:53:00] <%ozmon> Viv's hide is very nerfed in TTYD, it'll lose you all your turns though
[0:53:01] <+regis_j_rock> I know that's how Feeling Fine works at least
[0:53:03] <penitentpentwitch> He forgot
[0:53:06] <%yusefHD> YOO

[0:54:15] <sylphyyyy> not bad
[0:54:20] <GenericSoda> @RunoEddie LUL
[0:54:25] <%GodlyLuigi> ye
[0:54:28] <Polarix64> @RunoEddie LUL
[0:54:28] <%yusefHD> I assume you ran out of FP items
[0:54:28] <%DatAsuna> Viv is also good at attacking
[0:54:33] <+StrawberryPantsu> 20
[0:54:36] <Nomad94> here we go again
[0:54:38] <CrematedCube> Turn lost again
[0:54:41] <el_biribon> its a coincidence
[0:54:41] <+AbnormalVoid> I am not a crook
[0:54:42] <Papa_Bearman> Because Goombella's turn is skipped.
[0:54:42] <Polarix64> Frozen
[0:54:46] <%velemi> because her freeze skips her turn when you take her out
[0:54:46] <Mr_Strut> Because she frozen
[0:54:46] <%Proxzo> Frozen
[0:54:46] <townzzzzz> lose a turn
[0:54:47] <+marumariball> she used her turn as the last turn
[0:54:49] <%DatAsuna> yes
[0:54:51] <%Euphbugg> LUL
[0:54:52] <%Solidnick18> cause she is frozen
[0:54:54] <cosmicgoatee> regens every other other round
[0:54:59] <+Ancopro> yup
[0:54:59] <+skyheys> shes not gonna thaw unless shes out
[0:55:07] <+Ancopro> well she will now i think
[0:55:07] <+skyheys> so it doesnt matter
[0:55:08] <missingangle> Exactly, but now she can start attacking again
[0:55:10] <%nxflre> fuuuuu
[0:55:15] <%ozmon> Good morning Goombella
[0:55:16] <%cobalt_phoenix_> gotta take her out of the fridge
[0:55:18] <Papa_Bearman> OK, now Rally Wink and Power Bounce the hell out of him.
[0:55:18] <+AbnormalVoid> mwah

[0:55:22] <Mr_Strut> I think he's out of heals now
[0:55:24] <%yusefHD> God damn I hated this part of Bonetail. Still never beat him :(
[0:55:25] <%DatAsuna> now you can do the only move you know again. lol
[0:55:37] <Timurine> Is this tartarus?
[0:55:42] <Mr_Strut> Use basic attacks for meter build
[0:55:43] <sunnythedrunk> Flurrie tank
[0:55:46] <cosmicgoatee> your FP economy is lacking
[0:55:46] <%Euphbugg> Flurrie shield
[0:55:48] <%psidefx> FK I missed the journey to Bonetail
[0:55:52] <%chosenjuan42> Remember Woolie no one can make a save states back in day so if you die in pit you got to start all over
[0:56:02] <darkest_nightt> hi woolie
[0:56:05] <+AbnormalVoid> Showstopper Kappa
[0:56:07] <Nomad94> @psidefx there was no journey, streamed started on Floor 99
[0:56:09] <Polarix64> Or use Flurrie to tank the damage
[0:56:09] <%Euphbugg> @psidefx he did it off camera
[0:56:20] <%DarkestVegemite> He's got that damage buff item right?
[0:56:22] <%yusefHD> Shine sprites?

[1:00:26] <dreadedcthulhu> bobbery can drop big damage
[1:00:30] <%DatAsuna> koops can also tank with higher DEF

[1:25:25] <%ringabal> WHO???
[1:25:28] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[1:25:50] <sunnythedrunk> Is woolie saving the finale for next week?
[1:25:51] <xXShadow_BlazerXx> Coconut and Fire Flower
[1:25:55] <%Chatterbox1991> DO IT
[1:25:56] <%ozmon> RIGHT NOW
[1:25:57] <%Solidnick18> yeah
[1:25:58] <Papa_Bearman> You could just buy piantas.
[1:26:01] <+skyheys> never
[1:26:02] <%Chatterbox1991> DO BIG GAMBLE
[1:26:08] <sunnythedrunk> Just buy the piantas
[1:26:09] <%BallerSwagBro9k> GACHA TIME
[1:26:11] <@Menitta> now I'm hearing "Irasshaimase" in Toad voice
[1:26:14] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> do the gacha woolz
[1:26:15] <Prevot> aren't you rich due to ratcoin
[1:26:17] <+toruzio> can you just buy pinantas?
[1:26:27] <ingman112> You’re not gonna finish today; just do it between sessions
[1:26:32] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @Menitta God now i hear it NotLikeThis
[1:26:36] <%ozmon> Now you're thinking like a rich person
[1:26:40] <%chosenjuan42> you can mix syrups and mushrooms to combine their FP & HP
[1:26:45] <sunnythedrunk> @ingman112 Shhhhhh don't say that
[1:26:48] <%thekrawler> is today an extra long session?
[1:26:48] <CrematedCube> You have the Bump Attack badge now
[1:26:53] <xXShadow_BlazerXx> Equip the Bump Badge
[1:26:57] <Drusain> i mean woolie has likst 2000 coins or something
[1:27:05] <@akuda_bar> yeah i wouldn't call this a game-finishing pace lol
[1:27:08] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @thekrawler Theyre defo beating the game today so maybe
[1:27:11] <xXShadow_BlazerXx> 4-5 Gold Bars
[1:27:20] <%Proxzo> these guys dont give exp
[1:27:21] <RunoEddie> hey chat, remember how Woolie was gonna regret leveling up primarily BP? Kappa
[1:27:23] <@akuda_bar> last dungeon is surprisingly long
[1:27:24] <Papa_Bearman> Mushroom (+5 HP) plus Honey Syrup (+5 FP) equals a Honey Shroom (+5 HP and +5 FP). Combinations of mushrooms and syrups really are designed to save inventory space.
[1:27:29] <Polarix64> Oh yeah equip the Bump Attack badge so you don't even have to deal with these jabronis
[1:27:33] <dinnydanny777> Did we find White
[1:27:41] <Polarix64> yes
[1:27:42] <%benbag13> yeah
[1:27:43] <%yusefHD> Dude's neo with the matrix
[1:27:45] <Papa_Bearman> @dinnydanny777 He dealt with that shit off-screen.
[1:27:47] <CrematedCube> Bump Attack is the best backtracking badge
[1:27:50] <ShinobiPhoenix> back to the topic, who is the 3090 for except crazy people? if you're a streamer, your viewers don't have 8k capable displays, so they can't see the content. If you're playing for yourself, there isn't much content for you to see out there.
[1:27:50] <xXShadow_BlazerXx> Woolie Did it offscreen
[1:27:51] <%Proxzo> Job
[1:27:52] <dinnydanny777> Ah okay
[1:27:52] <%kinetikpaws> yeah last area is a big trek
[1:27:58] <%thekrawler> the npcs have funny dialogue
[1:28:00] <%thekrawler> here
[1:28:03] <@Menitta> LUL
[1:28:04] <%chosenjuan42> swap with lucky maybe?
[1:28:17] <xXShadow_BlazerXx> His tongue is stuck
[1:28:19] <Prevot> "Yeah, I hate those people too."
[1:28:22] <@Menitta> I love that
[1:28:23] <dinnydanny777> Our _____ are gone, all our _____ are gone
[1:28:38] <CastellanVon> jukes
[1:28:39] <+jiggy_snipe> what
[1:28:43] <Admiral_PopnFresh> privyet
[1:28:46] <+Estuko> LUL LUL
[1:28:51] <cosmicgoatee> 20 coins but you learned about the magic of FP candy
[1:28:58] <+天使42199> @ShinobiPhoenix Its if you have money and want to "future proof" or just fuck around at the top end
[1:28:58] <+paladinstarbuster> not woth
[1:28:58] <%ringabal> Not just our ______, but the word _____ too!
[1:29:00] <CrematedCube> the reward was the recipe
[1:29:19] <%ozmon> There goes 15 of the 20 coins
[1:29:19] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:29:33] <@Menitta> so the one piece is a cake recipe
[1:29:38] <ShinobiPhoenix> @天使42199 it's not futureproofing, by the time there is enough 8K to make your purchase worth it, there will be better cheaper cards available
[1:29:41] <%thekrawler> space food looks good
[1:29:43] <missingangle> And that's such a good recipe, since that's most of your FP
[1:29:50] <Polarix64> 20 FP is really good
[1:29:54] <%ringabal> @Menitta I wouldn't even be mad
[1:30:16] <+天使42199> @ShinobiPhoenix "thats why i said it in quotes. im well aware there will be other stuff available
[1:30:17] <CastellanVon> There goes the reward money lol
[1:30:17] <shiny_prinny> oh no
[1:30:21] <%chosenjuan42> MIX MAPLE AND SUPER SHROOM 10HP 10FP
[1:30:27] <%ozmon> Chekov's Ultra Shroom
[1:30:29] <%YakumoYomi> @ShinobiPhoenix Seems like the people that buy the top end cards are the type that just want to always be on the cutting edge. It could also be for VR, as VR is "power hungry" and will use every once of GPU and CPU muscle your system can muster
[1:30:47] <+MintyJelly> pasta and a dried shroom is honestly the best recipe in the game
[1:31:21] <Drusain> i mean don't worry about cooking, you already beat the hardest content in the game
[1:31:22] <+天使42199> but yeah 3090 is just I have the money so fuck it tier
[1:31:33] <+regis_j_rock> Yo, Egg + Fire Flower cool too
[1:31:36] <ShinobiPhoenix> I can see VR, but that is still very limited usage, I guess I'm not "crazy person" enough to want to spend that money on that kind of thing with nothing to use it for
[1:31:36] <%cobalt_phoenix_> dont the dry flowers turn into something super strong
[1:31:37] <dinnydanny777> Coconut Bomb vs Coconut Gun
[1:31:39] <Papa_Bearman> Use some items, I say.
[1:31:40] <theCoolChild> She got me spinning
[1:31:43] <%Chatterbox1991> DAYZEE
[1:31:47] <Mr_Strut> No bump attack?
[1:31:48] <+CrimsonDio11> couldve word the 3090 is just the Titan 2
[1:31:50] <Polarix64> Bump attack badge Woolie
[1:32:01] <sunnythedrunk> Yeah Bump attack to save time
[1:32:03] <+CrimsonDio11> sworn*
[1:32:06] <ShinobiPhoenix> Pat is definitely being silly wanting it, there's no way he would actually PAY for that
[1:32:09] <xXShadow_BlazerXx> Dry Flowers + Regular Food = Space Food Variants
[1:32:29] <+JingKaisean> $1500 isn't that much considering the previous titan was $2500
[1:32:33] <Mr_Strut> Bump attack will let you ignore battles
[1:32:35] <%chosenjuan42> Maybe re up your Merluvlee buffs too before door
[1:32:37] <cosmicgoatee> EZ
[1:32:39] <+regis_j_rock> Egg + Fire Flower and Coconut + Fire Flower if we just saying it
[1:32:41] <missingangle> The jukes
[1:33:00] <%nxflre> Lore rat?
[1:33:03] <%nxflre> Anyone?
[1:33:05] <Mr_Strut> It will tell you when it's out
[1:33:12] <cosmicgoatee> lore rat maybe
[1:33:15] <Polarix64> I mean it wouldn't hurt you have a ton of cash
[1:33:19] <%YakumoYomi> @ShinobiPhoenix Same. Even as a VR enthusiast, I'm still eyeing the 3070 because I'm not keen on spending $1500 (as that money could be spent on MOAR GAMES).
[1:33:19] <ShinobiPhoenix> doesn't that prove the point that the titan wasn't worth it? far superior card for a 1000 less
[1:33:22] <+regis_j_rock> You might as well going into the dungeon, but yes it does say
[1:33:35] <+CrimsonDio11> the titan also wasnt a gaming card
[1:33:40] <+CrimsonDio11> the titan is used for rendering
[1:34:01] <CrematedCube> You can also sell some things
[1:34:01] <+CrimsonDio11> and movie making
[1:34:06] <+JingKaisean> what? 3090 is the successor to the titan line
[1:34:16] <%kinetikpaws> I honestly would just clean your inventory with selling all the volt shrooms and spite pouches you have
[1:34:18] <+CrimsonDio11> thats what I thought
[1:34:30] <+CrimsonDio11> so get a 3080 if you want top of the line gaming
[1:34:43] <Polarix64> Man all those useless Dried Bouquets
[1:34:45] <GenericSoda> cash 4 gold
[1:34:51] <Mr_Strut> Mario king of the gold trade
[1:34:53] <+ConLin_Arts_> LUL
[1:35:02] <CrematedCube> At this point, you're safe ditching anything you'd never ever use
[1:35:04] <Papa_Bearman> You'll waste 37 coins doing this.
[1:35:04] <big_booty_animemilf> still gonna buy the 3090 CoolStoryBob
[1:35:09] <cosmicgoatee> like what 6 dried bouquets
[1:35:11] <+JingKaisean> unless you have a 8k 120hz setup, a 3080 should be fine
[1:35:12] <Mr_Strut> 38
[1:35:13] <Polarix64> No
[1:35:17] <Papa_Bearman> Eh, whatever.
[1:35:21] <Papa_Bearman> It's endgame, who cares?
[1:35:22] <ShinobiPhoenix> well unlike Reggie, when I finally build my first PC), at least I can go right for 3080
[1:35:24] <Mr_Strut> It's fine
[1:35:27] <missingangle> Eh, no big deal
[1:35:29] <Polarix64> You lost 100 coins though
[1:35:31] <%ringabal> Invest in Rat Gold
[1:35:44] <Polarix64> I guess it is end game but
[1:35:45] <%Irridium> do 8k monitors even exist yet. or at least exist at a price normal people can possibly afford
[1:35:57] <+JingKaisean> as long as you didn't buy a 2080ti last week, you're fine
[1:35:59] <ShinobiPhoenix> Absolutely not
[1:36:01] <+CrimsonDio11> Ive never seen an 8k monitor on the market
[1:36:06] <CrematedCube> Money is worthless now
[1:36:08] <+JingKaisean> they exist
[1:36:15] <%thekrawler> "cake mix"
[1:36:19] <Polarix64> Get those cak mix
[1:36:20] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1300611368941428737?s=19
[1:36:21] <+JingKaisean> but they're not standard
[1:36:23] <Polarix64> *cake
[1:36:26] <ShinobiPhoenix> they exists, they aren't at a normal person price
[1:36:27] <cosmicgoatee> you literally got the badge from Bonetail that forever invalidates the spit's pouches
[1:36:31] <cosmicgoatee> spite*
[1:36:34] <Papa_Bearman> You can only hold three cake mixes.
[1:37:08] <ShinobiPhoenix> and even if you bought one, it really is solely to play games for yourself, if you're a streamer, it's a bad purchase because your viewers can't see it
[1:37:13] <+JingKaisean> but again, you're asking for top of the line stuff and you yourself are not highest end
[1:37:32] <%kinetikpaws> I have a 2070 and I have my car almost paid off so I'm waiting
[1:37:34] <Stofil42> did woolie take a break from the game or something? ive noticed it hasnt been uploaded on youtube for a while
[1:38:01] <Potatoidea> The anime caught up with the manga
[1:38:04] <+regis_j_rock> @stofil42 the last few weeks were all 1 sesh so that might be why
[1:38:12] <+regis_j_rock> Less content to cut up
[1:38:14] <Papa_Bearman> @Stofil42 YouTube caught up with the stream.
[1:38:16] <xXShadow_BlazerXx> Honey+Dried Flowers
[1:38:20] <Potatoidea> Woolie wasn't brave enough to give us filler of him and Reggie going to driving school
[1:38:40] <Polarix64> Make sure you don't accidently choose the Space Food Woolie
[1:38:42] <cosmicgoatee> every time I hear about the 2080 stuff I just sigh...yes even 60 years from now LUL when the 2350 comes out
[1:38:44] <Stofil42> so wait has he been to the moon yet?
[1:38:55] <%chosenjuan42> you can mix any heal mushroom and any syrup together
[1:39:00] <Papa_Bearman> Moon's done.
[1:39:02] <Polarix64> @Stofil42 Yes
[1:39:08] <@Menitta> Heh I just realized I’m reading a manga while watching the manga
[1:39:10] <Papa_Bearman> He's just prepping for the Thousand-Year Door.
[1:39:20] <Stofil42> there is no reward
[1:39:24] <+Ancopro> its a free bed
[1:39:25] <+regis_j_rock> It's not really worth unless you missed the Troubles
[1:39:26] <Papa_Bearman> And he just finished up the Pit.
[1:39:27] <Polarix64> Re do Glitz Pit though Kappa
[1:39:27] <%chosenjuan42> it's not necessary
[1:39:30] <Skeletonmanners> there is no reward, you just refight rawk hawk and he has like 10 more hp
[1:39:30] <+regis_j_rock> *Tattles
[1:39:31] <the_saltiest> eve's trouble :(
[1:39:41] <xXShadow_BlazerXx> Reward for Doing Glitzpit Again is the bed
[1:39:42] <+天使42199> @cosmicgoatee judging by numbers 60 years from now would be the GTRTX 80000
[1:39:43] <%RadicalWeegee> WRONG
[1:39:47] <%RadicalWeegee> The belt is worth it
[1:39:47] <@akuda_bar> to be fair... it's fun to play again. but not fun to LP it.
[1:39:48] <%Chatterbox1991> you actually do get a reward
[1:39:52] <darkbrightdemon> jumpman who
[1:39:53] <Stofil42> I was really hoping there would be a prince mush fight at the end
[1:39:55] <@Menitta> Aw did they lose at the pit
[1:39:57] <Papa_Bearman> The only reward is getting the Champ's Belt again, which is a Bragging Rights Reward.
[1:39:58] <Polarix64> Get the belt back though Kappa
[1:40:02] <%RadicalWeegee> show of power

[1:42:37] <SomersaultJustice> ARE YOU SURE
[1:42:40] <GenericSoda> that's a shame because there's a genius one where he goes on a multi-tweet rant about something that's really good and informative, then caps it off with a single tweet that says ""fuck hulk hogan"

[1:45:17] <%derap41> Mario even has is own running crew
[1:45:27] <%ringabal> Mom and Pop store? In the Meadows? Oh no.
[1:45:36] <Papa_Bearman> By the way, Woolie, you notice how there's been absolutely no explanation for the noose in the town square?
[1:45:42] <%Superbro64> "everything"

[1:47:33] <%Solidnick18> oh nice
[1:47:35] <dinnydanny777> Dr Mario isn't a real doctor, he's really a special kind of chef
[1:47:43] <dinnydanny777> A chemist, you might say
[1:47:45] <%derap41> or a bomb

[1:48:07] <%thekrawler> space food, but you already got a badge that negates it

[1:52:43] <+regis_j_rock> Puni in the tree
[1:52:54] <Stofil42> I hope playing this game has made woolie curious to try out other great nintendo rpgs like mother 3 or superstar saga
[1:52:59] <%ringabal> "But Zest Dynamite, I sell Cake Mix to the community!"
[1:53:20] <shiny_prinny> (mystic egg + fire flower) + (coconut + fire flower)
[1:53:22] <%The_Timo> Wrong game
[1:53:37] <+regis_j_rock> Fire Burst and Big Egg is nothing
[1:53:39] <%Jaysky> The problem with Mother 3 is that you can't see anything going on cause you're blinded by tears
[1:53:43] <xXShadow_BlazerXx> @ringabal No more Cake Mix on the Streets\
[1:53:45] <+masked_hero_lucky> Pretty sure egg + flower is your most cost effective method
[1:53:47] <NotHereToStream> need a bit of olive oil
[1:53:51] <Mr_Strut> ye
[1:53:51] <Papa_Bearman> Make sure you're not looking at a recipe list for Paper Mario 64.

[1:54:05] <$phd_in_thuggery> I'm glad Woolie is appealing to my cooking fetish
[1:54:08] <+skyheys> oh god this is becoming some pat shit NotLikeThis
[1:54:09] <shiny_prinny> you might have to reload the area to get multiple eggs
[1:54:15] <redmage216> i think you can only have one egg at a time... been too long so i can't remember
[1:54:25] <+regis_j_rock> 4 Eggs
[1:54:30] <+Ancopro> even tho they already beat the hardest thing in the game LUL
[1:54:33] <cosmicgoatee> hey Kakyion where'd you find this egg LUL
[1:54:38] <%Jaysky> How does Violence feel about us cooking eggs?
[1:54:46] <Papa_Bearman> They're not Yoshi eggs; he doesn't care.
[1:54:47] <dinnydanny777> I hope that the coconut bomb fires in spurts

[1:57:45] <Papa_Bearman> @shiny_prinny Only place there is inside the tree, up a few levels. May as well just cook it now.
[1:57:49] <%doomerskeletor13> You’re breaking my heart Anakin
[1:57:53] <Blunder_Blue> So why is Woolie planning to prep so many Zess Dynamites? He realizes that by beating Bonetail he's proven the Palace of Shadow is nothing to him, right?

[1:58:27] <Polarix64> Squeeze that egg Kappa
[1:58:27] <Blunder_Blue> Fair enough. Firebomb the final dungeon.
[1:58:29] <%Solidnick18> she poppin out those eggs
[1:58:35] <%Chatterbox1991> 2004 woolie
[1:58:43] <%chosenjuan42> 2004
[1:58:48] <+skyheys> "Why does game not give me x99 for free?"
[1:58:50] <%doomerskeletor13> Reject genre, embrace tradition
[1:59:00] <+jiggy_snipe> Woolie forgot this game is 16 years old
[1:59:02] <BliVru> @woolieversus Diablo series?
[1:59:03] <+CptBritches> Yep, have fun :)
[1:59:05] <%RioGascar> 2004 is no excuse
[1:59:06] <penitentpentwitch> I do like the tradition of Final Exam boss, usually
[1:59:09] <%Chatterbox1991> 16 years old
[1:59:10] <+MrAsmoday> It's because they don't want you to just spam get this
[1:59:12] <@akuda_bar> you also 1) don't need these items and 2) this game's QOL design is, for the most part, extremely good
[1:59:16] <%RioGascar> Kotor and other rpgs were out
[1:59:24] <@akuda_bar> especially for speedrunning and for 100%ing
[1:59:25] <Prevot> 16 fucking years
[1:59:29] <+Wilabeen1997> 2004 is not a great excuse, people
[1:59:37] <%DatAsuna> In QoL? 2004 is dinosaur bones
[1:59:44] <Prevot> there could be someone watching this who wasn't even born in 2004
[1:59:45] <+MrAsmoday> The time wasted is the cost for a good idea, thats the point
[1:59:50] <+MrAsmoday> item
[1:59:50] <+skyheys> How is this a bad thing?
[1:59:52] <cosmicgoatee> replayability is dependant on a lot of factors, for this game I think it's great for both Completionists and a very wild and traversing story
[1:59:53] <+CptBritches> It's not an excuse but it is a reason
[1:59:55] <%doomerskeletor13> In 2004 I was 5 years old
[1:59:55] <%RioGascar> 2004 was halo 2
[1:59:56] <@Menitta> 16 years ago
[1:59:56] <%DatAsuna> QoL in RPGs is still trash today in 2020
[1:59:57] <penitentpentwitch> That being said, "The cards are the means by which all is revealed."
[1:59:59] <%Chatterbox1991> when did the push for Quality of Life start?
[1:59:59] <Papa_Bearman> Actually, 2004 was adulthood for me.
[2:00:02] <%DatAsuna> Halo2 isn't a JRPG
[2:00:03] <+regis_j_rock> This was 3 Console generations, gotta disagrew on 2004 not being that long ago
[2:00:03] <%Chatterbox1991> like 2014?
[2:00:04] <%ringabal> SASAAAAAGEYO SASAAAAAAAGEYO
[2:00:09] <%kinetikpaws> I was 15 when this came out
[2:00:14] <Papa_Bearman> 18
[2:00:18] <edward11231> This is an old game after all
[2:00:24] <Polarix64> 4
[2:00:25] <%RioGascar> Push for QoL started with every games iterations
[2:00:26] <missingangle> Oh absolutely. It's one of my favorite games ever but between some mechanics that could be improved and the backtracking, it's flawed, naturally
[2:00:32] <$phd_in_thuggery> 7
[2:00:50] <%yusefHD> Piped a lot LUL
[2:00:58] <@Menitta> I was 7.
[2:01:00] <%RioGascar> This is honestly just tiny nitpicks that dont detract from the game but do get noticed
[2:01:01] <@akuda_bar> mostly it seems like the times woolie gets stuck on something QOL i have to stop and wonder what it is he's trying to do and why anyway lol
[2:01:14] <%chosenjuan42> If they ever remake it we known what changes are need3
[2:01:15] <Papa_Bearman> Zess T.! We comin' fo YOU, niaaAAAHH!
[2:01:16] <%DatAsuna> There's shit in The Outer Worlds that had been solved QoL problems in 2009 by the community. QoL in RPGs is never where it should be.
[2:01:22] <%Solidnick18> idk
[2:01:22] <missingangle> I mean it can't hurt to do it?
[2:01:24] <%chosenjuan42> save
[2:01:29] <Polarix64> Re up right before the door
[2:01:30] <@akuda_bar> like "let me go fill my inventory with perfect healing items" "oh, why would you need that" "goblins idk"
[2:01:31] <cosmicgoatee> backtracking is fun when it's not an unnecessarily padded out fetch sidequest but maybe opening new areas or unlocking new places and items with mechanics
[2:01:32] <%DatAsuna> That said 2004 for RPGs, western or japanese was barely anything
[2:01:37] <%bread_assassin> So how much damage does this super bomb do anyways?
[2:01:41] <%doomerskeletor13> I actually have no idea what they’re doing rn, I left for like 10 minutes and now they’re going on a cooking spree
[2:01:42] <+skyheys> this game has tons of problems, but I dont see how Petuni not giving you a million eggs is one of them
[2:01:48] <%Solidnick18> lol
[2:01:49] <Drusain> woo 2 exp
[2:01:50] <%RioGascar> 2 xp
[2:01:57] <%Solidnick18> yeee 2xp
[2:02:00] <+jiggy_snipe> I think he is stocking up on good items
[2:02:03] <BliVru> No I did :)
[2:02:04] <%chosenjuan42> you did the pit so you might of used Merluvlee a lot
[2:02:08] <%Jaysky> If they ever remake this game all the Toads will be a blank slate, all red toads, no noose, no Mz Mowz, no TEC
[2:02:16] <@akuda_bar> at this level he's not going to need to heal this much anyway so bleh
[2:02:22] <hassanico2> Guys they gonna finish it today? OR just cleanup?
[2:02:24] <%chosenjuan42> the cross toads
[2:02:34] <@akuda_bar> @hassanico2 definitely no game over today unless he goes past 5:30 or so
[2:02:37] <%RioGascar> I am disappointed this game or any old paper mario games didnt get switch releases today
[2:02:40] <%doomerskeletor13> Isn’t he super buffed up? Does he need a lot of items?
[2:02:40] <jettsetter> they could have finished
[2:02:41] <hassanico2> ah dang
[2:02:46] <+regis_j_rock> @hassanico2 final dungeon is a few hours so I doubt it
[2:02:49] <%RioGascar> honestly i feel the mario 35th anniversary sucked
[2:02:49] <Blunder_Blue> @doomerskeletor13 Not at all.
[2:02:50] <cosmicgoatee> VIOLENCE..we have to cook
[2:02:52] <Papa_Bearman> @doomerskeletor13 He WANTS a lot of items.
[2:02:57] <%doomerskeletor13> I see
[2:03:10] <dinnydanny777> This is why Dr Mario is a Dr

[2:03:25] <%RioGascar> THE MUSHROOM VIOLENCE, its...its going bad
[2:03:27] <cosmicgoatee> Breaking Balut
[2:03:28] <+jiggy_snipe> it's kinda funny cuz I don't think Woolie was a big item user anyway
[2:03:32] <@Solidus_113> I learned that from Food Wars
[2:03:32] <%Solidnick18> balut bomb
[2:03:33] <jettsetter> will woolie even use these bombs

[2:06:54] <+i_heart_gaming> How is she just making bombs now?
[2:06:55] <%ringabal> Violence opens the kitchen door to the sound of "SOY SOY SOY SOY"
[2:06:57] <cosmicgoatee> LUL that's the mindset of a true blue patriot Reggie

[2:09:35] <%cobalt_phoenix_> eh he has 3 that should be more than enough
[2:09:35] <@Solidus_113> All this food talk is making me too hungry, I haven't eaten yet

[2:09:39] <dreadedcthulhu> bomb and bomb

[2:09:41] <hassanico2> Woolie you set the bomb on fire LUL
[2:09:43] <cosmicgoatee> no you combine two bombs together
[2:09:43] <%DarkestVegemite> it was already a bomb
[2:09:44] <SixthSun2> you used a coconut bomb, not a regular coconut
[2:09:46] <Scorchfield> egg bomb and coconut bomb
[2:09:46] <+Ancopro> coconut bomb not coconut
[2:09:48] <Mr_Strut> You used fire flower and bomb
[2:09:51] <%yusefHD> LUL
[2:09:55] <+Masamune195> save so you can reload at some point so you dont gotta redo it all
[2:09:55] <+skyheys> NotLikeThis

[2:10:11] <hassanico2> Flower + Bomb, fucking LUL
[2:10:12] <CirclesForever> are they using the guide on the wiki?
[2:10:12] <el_biribon> you did flower + coconut bomb
[2:10:12] <Mr_Strut> Fire flower and bomb
[2:10:14] <Papa_Bearman> You had both bombs, but then for some fucking reason, you bought a Fire Flower and used that.
[2:10:15] <Polarix64> You used a Coconut bomb and Fire Flower when you should have used Coconut Bomb and Egg Bomb
[2:10:18] <Scorchfield> you just did egg bomb with fire flower
[2:10:26] <%KyoryUtchy> Your already HAD a Coconut bomb then you combined it with a Fire Flower
[2:10:27] <cosmicgoatee> you thought it was a coconut not the bomb
[2:10:28] <%chosenjuan42> you had coco bomb
[2:10:28] <%cobalt_phoenix_> it's fiiiine
[2:10:30] <+skyheys> it's okay! three is good!

[2:11:17] <Polarix64> 3 bombs is probably fine
[2:11:17] <%velemi> can't sleep in the kitchen, you'll burn your house down
[2:11:27] <%neraren> Mistake

[2:12:38] <%yusefHD> I know Woolie doesn't point out gift subs and donations live, but hot damn that's a lot.
[2:12:44] <Polarix64> You need more healing items
[2:12:46] <Papa_Bearman> You only have one item that will re-up your HP.
[2:12:46] <hassanico2> you're saaaafe
[2:12:47] <%chosenjuan42> Luigi trouble
[2:12:49] <%cobalt_phoenix_> PogChamp
[2:12:51] <redmage216> few healing items maybe?
[2:12:57] <%thekrawler> woolieCHAN
[2:13:01] <Polarix64> More HP healing would be nice
[2:13:03] <shiny_prinny> more life shrooms/hp healing?
[2:13:14] <Drusain> jamming jelly
[2:13:21] <SixthSun2> You can upgrade dried shrooms as well
[2:13:22] <redmage216> volt shrooms cook into decent stuff on their own
[2:13:26] <CrematedCube> Some super shrooms from the west side shop and you are fully set
[2:13:34] <hassanico2> Does Jammin Jelly + Ultra Shroom do anything?
[2:13:35] <+jiggy_snipe> you don't like cooking? Kappa
[2:13:36] <SixthSun2> Yeah, moving on is fine
[2:13:40] <theCoolChild> This was the Beach Episode
[2:13:42] <shiny_prinny> can also mix your dried bouquets and volt shrooms to get some thunder rages
[2:13:46] <%yusefHD> HANGING
[2:13:51] <+MrAsmoday> but the jammin' jellyyyy
[2:13:54] <%Euphbugg> Man, cooking arc was intense
[2:13:54] <Polarix64> You need HP healing items in your inventory though
[2:13:55] <%chosenjuan42> ultra shroom + jam is 50fp 50hp
[2:13:59] <%velemi> Jammin Jelly + ultra shroom is best healing item in the game
[2:14:04] <+jiggy_snipe> drop your hp
[2:14:06] <Papa_Bearman> Maybe unequip ALL your badges and start over.
[2:14:08] <%LoVezineTheAir> remove lucky day
[2:14:15] <CrematedCube> I'm not against saving the remaining troubles for postgame
[2:14:20] <el_biribon> isnt 30 max level?
[2:14:22] <%yusefHD> @LoVezineTheAir nahhhh think of the hype
[2:14:29] <%chosenjuan42> Lucky start?
[2:14:32] <exnuart> max level is 99
[2:14:34] <+regis_j_rock> @el_biribon nah dog, 99
[2:14:40] <el_biribon> oh right, 30 is 64
[2:14:42] <Polarix64> Lucky was really nice for the boss I would keep it
[2:14:48] <+regis_j_rock> 64 is only 27
[2:14:55] <An_Armed_Bear> They doing the pit or going to the final stretch?
[2:14:57] <el_biribon> oh? ok then
[2:14:59] <+regis_j_rock> Every stat caps much earlier in that on
[2:15:00] <%LoVezineTheAir> lucky day + return postage means he gets less mileage out of return postage
[2:15:02] <Papa_Bearman> Pit's done.
[2:15:03] <+Ancopro> can't 64 soft lock from leveling too much
[2:15:04] <+jiggy_snipe> drop it
[2:15:05] <Polarix64> You could trade it
[2:15:08] <%chosenjuan42> @an_armed_bear they did pit
[2:15:08] <+regis_j_rock> 50, 50, 30
[2:15:12] <+jiggy_snipe> lucky day kinda conflicts
[2:15:12] <MrAquaFina> pretty dank build
[2:15:13] <+regis_j_rock> Is 64 max stats
[2:15:13] <cosmicgoatee> @an_armed_bear they just beat the pit DarkMode
[2:15:14] <Drusain> It makes no sense to have Defense Plus with Return Postage since you're giving less damage
[2:15:15] <%MageValerie> Sending this later than I meant to from gifts, but I hope everyone has a great day!
[2:15:17] <%LoVezineTheAir> i do agree with hype tho lol
[2:15:23] <%chosenjuan42> LUCKY START IS FUN
[2:16:04] <%ringabal> Oh this is gonna be good
[2:16:08] <+regis_j_rock> Just keep in mind, is a counter useful if you're not getting hit?
[2:16:17] <Polarix64> Do Eve's quest though Keepo
[2:16:18] <%DarkestVegemite> Doesn't spite pouch and return postage stack?
[2:16:19] <cosmicgoatee> 'Last trouble' Kappa
[2:16:24] <townzzzzz> talk to ya bro

[2:17:18] <RunoEddie> are there any troubles that unlock after that REDACTED trouble?
[2:17:22] <Skeletonmanners> i dont understand going for 99% other than to bully people with ocd
[2:17:25] <%chosenjuan42> No one else is needed
[2:17:34] <pookam> there will be exactly zero (0) troubles left after this mission
[2:17:35] <%yusefHD> Literally craigslist

[2:17:40] <dinnydanny777> "my wife left me, send help"
[2:17:41] <BliVru> TERRORISM somehow
[2:17:42] <+CptBritches> It would be used for sex like Craigslist
[2:17:52] <dinnydanny777> "can you buy me fifty packets of cough medicine"
[2:17:53] <NotHereToStream> JO crystals on craigslist
[2:17:55] <%chosenjuan42> Craigslist
[2:17:57] <CrematedCube> Isn't that just the premise of Persona 5?
[2:17:57] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[2:18:00] <+CptBritches> It would be dirty sex in Waffle House bathrooms mostly
[2:18:07] <%ringabal> Tree Fiddy, final offer

[2:33:28] <%Th3SmartAlec> SUCC
[2:33:33] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> Luigi’s mansion was behind the Thousand-Year Door the whole time!

[2:33:46] <+CptBritches> Sir Succs A Lot
[2:33:46] <%brachydios777> Ez
[2:33:48] <DeepSearch27> Is Reg into that?
[2:33:48] <yusefHD> Y'all hear about Robert Pattinson getting Covid? Dude's literally batman :(
[2:33:53] <BearSawed> Gunjumper one guy
[2:33:55] <hassanico2> Curious if Woolie will have trouble
[2:33:58] <%ozmon> No wonder Bonetail wouldn't fork over any more xp
[2:34:02] <%FuqBoiSlim> @yusefhd NOOOO
[2:34:04] <%thekrawler> plow the enemies like fresh snow
[2:34:08] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Just a tad LUL
[2:34:09] <%yusefHD> Yeah. Production paused.
[2:34:09] <%FuqBoiSlim> DID HE REALLY?
[2:34:09] <%DarkestVegemite> SUPERNOVA
[2:34:11] <hassanico2> Like, are the bombs for the finale?
[2:34:13] <%xXjuffelXx> Did he get the reflect badge back on?
[2:34:13] <%fly2555_of_the_rebellion> did you switch back?
[2:34:15] <%NopeBadguy> violence can mini egg the rest
[2:34:15] <irregularly_irregular> I never beat Bonetail as a kid playing this :[
[2:34:23] <+MagiKestral> try out supernova?
[2:34:25] <%chosenjuan42> does badge work on suck?
[2:34:33] <%nxflre> This chapter is gonna be a breeze with 81 BP
[2:34:36] <%DukeBlack_> did woolie finish the pit?
[2:34:42] <irregularly_irregular> yeah
[2:34:43] <%chosenjuan42> @dukeblack_ yes
[2:34:45] <%nxflre> @DukeBlack_ yeeeeeeeeeeep
[2:34:46] <%thekrawler> the pit is finished
[2:34:46] <%ozmon> And didn't even get to heal
[2:34:47] <An_Armed_Bear> Hoping he doesn't just instantly annihilate the final fight but eh
[2:34:48] <%DukeBlack_> nice
[2:34:50] <%ringabal> "This blood is POISONED!"
[2:35:08] <%morgantj> cost is too damn high
[2:35:08] <%ozmon> I didn't even know your BP could go up to 81 lol
[2:35:08] <+skyheys> 1 star point per fight
[2:35:10] <ingman112> I think the final fight might be harder than we expect
[2:35:11] <%MonsterEnvy> Poor Swoop
[2:35:12] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> You could have ran past
[2:35:14] <%Proxzo> is it worth it to equip bumps?
[2:35:15] <%chosenjuan42> Lucky start is hype
[2:35:15] <+MagiKestral> a lot of TTYD streamers I know consider it a not great badge
[2:35:17] <%BallerSwagBro9k> TOO DAM HIGH
[2:35:18] <SixthSun2> The BP cap is 99
[2:35:20] <exnuart> bp only runs do exist people
[2:35:21] <+regis_j_rock> If you want my opinion it's pretty bad tbh but you do you
[2:35:23] <ingman112> The main reason being multi attacks
[2:35:25] <hassanico2> Doing 2 damage to all enemies or not taking daamge, your call
[2:35:38] <%DatAsuna> if you just throw viv on before doors you should be safe from stumbling into said cutscene by accident, but be free to roll with whoever @woolieversus
[2:35:47] <ingman112> Bonetail, for all his strength, is only hitting once a turn
[2:35:57] <%DatAsuna> yeah the cost is just too high for the gain
[2:36:08] <%ozmon> Yeah, ideally you don't want to be taking damage, so if a badge only activates when you take damage, that already means your kind of in a poor scenario
[2:36:09] <%DatAsuna> if it reflected every damage type then maybe
[2:36:13] <%DatAsuna> but even then
[2:36:16] <%LoVezineTheAir> the strat for Return Postage is usually to pair it with Double Pain for decent damage and Danger/Peril badges to get Mario poppjn
[2:36:21] <Papa_Bearman> Nicely done.
[2:36:21] <%ozmon> And if they're ranged, it does very nothing for you
[2:36:30] <hassanico2> Ah, the defense command also decreases the damge you'll deal via badge right?
[2:36:33] <@akuda_bar> violence's regular attack just isn't the same without the deafening sound the wavebird's R button makes
[2:36:41] <%Euphbugg> yeah, go for the dodge
[2:36:43] <An_Armed_Bear> click click click click
[2:36:43] <Polarix64> Yeah Lucky is better than Return
[2:36:45] <%chosenjuan42> You should use LUCKY START
[2:36:49] <@Menitta> CLACKCLACKCLACK
[2:36:53] <%DarkestVegemite> honestly zap tap is better
[2:36:59] <@akuda_bar> it's not even the clack clack clack it's the SHOCKA CLACK SHOCKA CLACK
[2:37:00] <%chosenjuan42> it's pretty fun
[2:37:11] <$phd_in_thuggery> haha GC triggers go CLCICCKCLCKCKCLC
[2:37:15] <%KyoryUtchy> And with your HP total you really want to be avoiding/minimizing damage as much as possible.
[2:37:16] <+regis_j_rock> If the BP cost was a lot lower maybe but otherwise yoyr giving up amazing badges to use it
[2:37:17] <%chosenjuan42> I guess not
[2:37:18] <%Proxzo> @WoolieVersus Did you equip feeling fine
[2:37:20] <+MagiKestral> fun fact! a lot of the Pit badges are from the original paper mario
[2:37:21] <Drusain> it's for proof of completion tbh
[2:37:23] <el_biribon> 14 BP for two badges hell no
[2:37:23] <%ozmon> Return Postage is a fun Achievement Badge though
[2:37:24] <+skyheys> @menitta Dreamcast games arent the same without the sound of a rocket engine at every load screen
[2:37:24] <CrematedCube> If you're doing good, you shouldn't be getting hit to begin with
[2:37:26] <%nxflre> yeah better way to do it
[2:37:31] <SixthSun2> Nah, you'll know where the end is
[2:37:36] <%BallerSwagBro9k> THE BOYS S2 TOMMOROW LADS
[2:37:40] <%DatAsuna> yeah it's too early now
[2:37:45] <%DarkestVegemite> oh god
[2:37:49] <%fly2555_of_the_rebellion> it will be obvious
[2:37:51] <%ozmon> Basically once it stops looking dungeony
[2:37:52] <%DatAsuna> but just checking on doors is good for blind
[2:37:54] <irregularly_irregular> I can't remember if this dungeon is particularly long... i do remember it having several bosses, though
[2:37:57] <Drusain> The room they're talking about is very telegraphed
[2:38:00] <dinnydanny777> When do we fight Dark Marii
[2:38:01] <%ringabal> The Protheans?
[2:38:04] <$phd_in_thuggery> Eat the rich
[2:38:05] <dinnydanny777> Mario*
[2:38:06] <Polarix64> Don
[2:38:27] <Polarix64> Don't worry about snoofs at this point it really doesn't matter
[2:38:29] <@akuda_bar> you have at least an hour to go before it. so don't even worry.
[2:38:30] <+skyheys> save block'll tip em off
[2:38:34] <%DatAsuna> yee
[2:38:37] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Did someone call me/
[2:38:37] <pookam> This better be the best line in the whole game
[2:38:38] <%ozmon> Thanks for giving thought to us like this, Woolie!
[2:38:40] <CrematedCube> A boss fountain is a good indicator
[2:38:43] <+regis_j_rock> You will definitely have a save before what chat wants
[2:38:54] <$phd_in_thuggery> again, I'm sorry for being today's woolieONEGUY
[2:38:57] <%Proxzo> Goombella can murder pretty good
[2:39:02] <irregularly_irregular> footsies
[2:39:17] <+skyheys> @phd_in_thuggery If you said nothing he would miss it
[2:39:19] <%chosenjuan42> if you use LUCKY START you can get a damage buff if you are lucky
[2:39:19] <el_biribon> there is one guy within all of us
[2:39:22] <+skyheys> dont worry
[2:39:25] <An_Armed_Bear> I'm listening to the final fight's track and I forgot how good it is
[2:39:49] <$phd_in_thuggery> I actually never got to the end
[2:39:49] <%Jp3g95> rcomYeet rcomRiot
[2:39:50] <%ringabal> HIS BONES: WACK

[2:39:53] <DeepSearch27> B O N E
[2:39:53] <Polarix64> If you see a save and heal block right before a door then you should worry about equipping Vivian other than that you're probably fine
[2:40:00] <+SwerveBootyHammer> like castlevania skeleton
[2:40:03] <ingman112> The entire last section of music is fucking stellar
[2:40:04] <%ringabal> HIS STERNUM: WACK

[2:40:44] <Polarix64> It's an attack item
[2:40:45] <+AbnormalVoid> Ice Strorm
[2:40:45] <Drusain> damage and cold
[2:40:46] <el_biribon> ice storm is a good item
[2:40:46] <hassanico2> Attack + Chance to Freeze item
[2:40:47] <+Ancopro> ice?
[2:40:49] <+天使42199> When I was a kid I got so close to beating the last boss first try and then couldn't for years ....
[2:40:49] <+regis_j_rock> Yoshi can oneshot the bats?
[2:40:52] <uberdude47> @ozzrabbit haha
[2:40:53] <CrematedCube> Ice attack
[2:40:53] <sunnythedrunk> Ice storm is worth
[2:40:55] <el_biribon> 4 damage to every enemy + freeze
[2:40:55] <DeepSearch27> get out

[3:12:25] <sunnythedrunk> The problem with stacking all that BP is you need constantly need to replenish Hp and Fp
[3:12:26] <jettsetter> bobbery has a big attack
[3:12:26] <StarMechV> VASH THE STAMPEDE
[3:12:30] <+skyheys> Fiery Jinx does more
[3:12:30] <exnuart> bobbery hits for 10
[3:12:31] <Papa_Bearman> You're thinking of the wrong attack, Woolie.
[3:12:32] <%cobalt_phoenix_> dynamite tyme?
[3:12:34] <%ozmon> I think it's.... 3 2 1 2 1 1, = 10
[3:12:34] <%Euphbugg> He has the final bobbery
[3:12:35] <+Slattsquatch> ???
[3:12:35] <CrematedCube> It should be strong enough
[3:12:37] <Polarix64> I would say Bobbery's strongest attack
[3:12:43] <%chosenjuan42> no he has a big book too
[3:12:44] <+regis_j_rock> Bobbery's last move is ridic
[3:12:45] <dinnydanny777> I just noticed it but the Shy guys staring back at the camera creeps me out

[3:24:54] <Papa_Bearman> Give him a kiss.
[3:24:55] <+zooeymainbtw> gotta blow them up
[3:24:57] <%Euphbugg> explode to remove the bones
[3:24:58] <+zooeymainbtw> or fire
[3:25:00] <RandomAccess64> To get rid of the bones, use fire or explosions
[3:25:01] <%NopeBadguy> Vivian or Bobbery to blow them up
[3:25:02] <%glass_marcus> Pokemon is great because the number is irrevelant, it's all about the percentage

[3:53:38] <+regis_j_rock> Yo, take of Defend Plus for Flower Saver P
[3:53:39] <CrematedCube> I'd put Flower Saver back on, that FP economy
[3:53:48] <BearSawed> I Mean gwyn didnt kill them all
[3:54:04] <%RadicalWeegee> pretty lucky <3
[3:54:05] <%chosenjuan42> lucky start
[3:54:08] <%yusefHD> Pimps Up.
[3:54:09] <+linSP> another P-up?
[3:54:24] <BearSawed> Seeth and the ash lake dragon lived
[3:54:28] <%chosenjuan42> Lucky start is a great you can possibly get an attack buff
[3:54:39] <%thekrawler> p-up time
[3:54:48] <+regis_j_rock> Also the Happy badges have been pretty useless for you tbh
[3:54:54] <%thekrawler> lucky start is great
[3:54:58] <%yusefHD> Do it you mad jumpman, you
[3:55:02] <%NopeBadguy> @WoolieVersus On top of the percent chance to fail, the actual timing window will actually decrease as the Power Bounce goes longer, capping at 1 frame.
[3:55:02] <Potatoidea> Item Pog
[3:55:07] <%GoneWithLaw> Flower Saver = God Mode
[3:55:09] <%RadicalWeegee> is gooooood
[3:55:12] <Mr_Strut> Free buff
[3:55:13] <$mattynezz> Damage on power bounce is exponential, so P-Up might be worth it, like 10 more damage
[3:55:14] <%thekrawler> random buff is really good
[3:55:14] <%ringabal> Does Double Dip mean twice the bombs?
[3:55:15] <darkbrightdemon> good
[3:55:15] <dreadedcthulhu> p up tho
[3:55:16] <ShiningAxis> double dip for the insurance, everything else is just extra
[3:55:17] <Papa_Bearman> That's a permanent Merlee.
[3:55:17] <%cobalt_phoenix_> do iiiiit
[3:55:18] <SixthSun2> It gives you a positive buff
[3:55:19] <%Proxzo> lol going lucky ted
[3:55:20] <+regis_j_rock> Flower Savers are better so good
[3:55:21] <+zooeymainbtw> flower saver is pretty lit
[3:55:23] <%chosenjuan42> free buff
[3:55:27] <+zooeymainbtw> so is lucky start
[3:55:29] <%NopeBadguy> I think Lucky Start is too inconsistent to be useful
[3:55:29] <%ozmon> They're all pretty good buffs too
[3:55:33] <%chosenjuan42> invisible dodge attack defence

[3:55:58] <Papa_Bearman> How did he get in here?!
[3:55:59] <%thekrawler> lucky start is good for non-ohko builds
[3:56:03] <RunoEddie> description for All or Nothing is scary, but at this point it's very unlikely you'll miss an action command unless you're being lazy

[3:59:20] <+linSP> one more stream
[3:59:22] <@akuda_bar> you won't get a better place to stop
[3:59:22] <%yusefHD> Emergency Friday stream?
[3:59:24] <+zooeymainbtw> good place to stop honestly
[3:59:24] <%chiluzza> pause it end is just rush
[3:59:26] <%doomerskeletor13> Next week sounds good
[3:59:27] <Prevot> gg
[3:59:28] <BlackermanZX> Dammit i'll miss the ending next week doodSad
[3:59:28] <cosmicgoatee> next week finale let's GOOOO
[3:59:30] <+Ancopro> this works cause they can check postgamenext time
[3:59:31] <$mattynezz> I don't think there's much dungeon left, but lots of bosses
[3:59:31] <Blunder_Blue> Yeah, one stream to finish and be like "Oh, cool postgame world."
[3:59:32] <Nomad94> this is a good place to stop
[3:59:34] <RunoEddie> I like this purple bandana
[3:59:34] <+jiggy_snipe> this is a good stopping point anyway
[3:59:37] <@akuda_bar> i wasnt expecting you to wrap up today LUL
[3:59:38] <$phd_in_thuggery> FOUR MORE DAYS
[3:59:40] <+regis_j_rock> @gelphaze It's just an Ultra Shroom and a Jammin Jelly
[3:59:43] <Ookamiden02> that's fine
[3:59:44] <CrematedCube> The final dungeon is surprisingly big
[3:59:45] <RunoEddie> Purple bandana is cool
[3:59:48] <Vaardvark> 2 dragons in one stream
[3:59:49] <%gatorafan> This is good, people will want you to make postgame
[3:59:51] <Papa_Bearman> Sorry if we were too pushy, Woolie. This game has a TON of little things that can be missed if you don't exactly meet the circumstances.
[3:59:52] <missingangle> Basically, if you didn't do all the extra stuff and went right to the door, you could have, but I like watching you do all the side stuff
[3:59:52] <+zooeymainbtw> big boy dungeon
[4:00:01] <cosmicgoatee> hey you took care of all 3 dragons that's progress
[4:00:07] <SiegeJay> WOOLIE GET VIV OUT! THE PICKLE STONE! memes etc.
[4:00:12] <+zooeymainbtw> yeyeye
[4:00:15] <Nomad94> the palace is big, woolie, it's fine
[4:00:19] <RunoEddie> I'm guessing you just got past Bowser's Keep, and got to the Factory
[4:00:20] <Nomad94> SeemsGood
[4:00:20] <+jiggy_snipe> crimes to commit Kappa
[4:00:22] <@akuda_bar> i'm rolling out for the afternoon good stream gg chat
[4:00:23] <+Ancopro> dragons are drag gones
[4:00:24] <%yusefHD> SD Cards, or Thin Mints, can't tell
[4:00:28] <%ringabal> Uzumaki Eugenics?
[4:00:42] <flowers4zoe> im probably uninformed, but when will next stream of this game be?
[4:00:43] <Sgww> is there even anymore post-game stuff besides da pit?
[4:00:44] <%gatorafan> HOKUTO NO KEN woolieGASM
[4:00:51] <Papa_Bearman> Next should be last.
[4:00:52] <CrematedCube> It'd be nice to have some spare time to putter around postgame
[4:00:52] <+jiggy_snipe> @flowers4zoe tuesday most likely
[4:00:55] <%yusefHD> Better not bring yo kidz~
[4:00:58] <+skyheys> @sgww There's Luigi 5
[4:01:13] <RunoEddie> "Mom I just beat the game, look!"
[4:01:16] <flowers4zoe> @jiggy_snipe thank you
[4:01:17] <+MisterRaffles> The Time of Retribution?
[4:01:21] <%SirGO0SE> have that breathing room and a fresh mind
[4:01:34] <HereComestheChief> Good stream, looking forward to the finale
[4:01:40] <+jiggy_snipe> Woolie you are making the right decision in stopping
[4:01:42] <Nomad94> Persona games are way too long
[4:01:42] <HereComestheChief> Thanks Woolie and Reggie 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
[4:01:43] <%faytthepally> Energized hype > sleepy end of stream hype
[4:01:44] <+regis_j_rock> Just note: you won't even need Vivian ready for the beginning of next stream
[4:01:44] <sunnythedrunk> Persona games have 4 hour endings yeah
[4:01:48] <%Proxzo> OH GOD, p5 ending sequence was brutal
[4:02:01] <%NopeBadguy> that's DISGUSTING
[4:02:05] <reonome> LUL
[4:02:10] <@akuda_bar> thanks for that awful mental image
[4:02:10] <%NopeBadguy> NEVER make that comparison again
[4:02:13] <%Chatterbox1991> Woolie not every RPG is Persona
[4:02:15] <%NopeBadguy> that's fucking GROSS
[4:02:17] <An_Armed_Bear> Persona games always go one dungeon too far
[4:02:17] <%Chatterbox1991> 2004
[4:02:20] <Nomad94> it's not a game, I'm not a robot I challenging you
[4:02:20] <%yusefHD> And you're god damn right I'll chew it again
[4:02:27] <%psidefx> "Its already in my mouth why take it away?"
[4:02:29] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> P5 was 20 hours too long
[4:02:30] <+skyheys> @chatterbox1991 a LOT of RPGs are though
[4:02:30] <+regis_j_rock> Persona 4: I thought this was the epilogue, what do you mean one last dungeon?
[4:02:36] <CrematedCube> I sincerely thought that the halfway point of P5 was actually the ending
[4:02:50] <Papa_Bearman> https://clips.twitch.tv/RepleteRockyPoultryGrammarKing
[4:02:59] <%DatAsuna> P3 still best for a reason
[4:03:04] <Nomad94> I really liked P5, but I'm not ever gonna play Royal NEVER EVER
[4:03:16] <%cobalt_phoenix_> hey chat i've never played any persona games but if i start at 5 with the plan to play 4 later, am i gonna run into any issues?
[4:03:26] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I MISSED THE FINALE?
[4:03:27] <An_Armed_Bear> Some QoL stuff absent from 4
[4:03:29] <Sgww> @CanadianAnimatorGuy still wild how atlus looked at that ending and was just like, "yeah lets add a new dungeon"
[4:03:29] <dreadedcthulhu> the advantages of not playing persona games on first launch
[4:03:34] <Nomad94> @cobalt_phoenix_ 5 is way more user friendly
[4:03:41] <%BallerSwagBro9k> THAT KILLED NE
[4:03:47] <RunoEddie> I'm glad Royal came out before I played 5, because I have no intention of ever going back to 4 for Golden
[4:03:49] <+regis_j_rock> @cobalt_phoenix_ 5 has some gameplay polish that might make 4 hard but otherwise it's fine
[4:03:55] <An_Armed_Bear> Finale's not done
[4:03:57] <Papa_Bearman> @BallerSwagBro9k Tune in next week.
[4:03:57] <%cobalt_phoenix_> thanks guys
[4:03:58] <%NopeBadguy> LUL
[4:04:03] <+Slattsquatch> The new content in Royal is unironically the best part of the game but you still to replay the first 90+ hours if you already played vanilla
[4:04:05] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Persona 4 G end killed me
[4:04:10] <+skyheys> it was in the original game though
[4:04:12] <%doomerskeletor13> LUL
[4:04:14] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @papa_bearman good
[4:04:16] <%yusefHD> The fucking ski lift tv LUL
[4:04:22] <+regis_j_rock> @cobalt_phoenix_ As a heads up going from 4 to 3 is harder than 5 to 4
[4:04:25] <townzzzzz> get got
[4:04:31] <+masked_hero_lucky> Yeah, I didn't get the real ending playing the original because of that crap
[4:04:32] <pixel_river> return of the king end
[4:04:35] <+linSP> what if when p4 ended the real game started
[4:04:39] <Rhinoprotoss> You don't even play February or March...
[4:04:40] <%BallerSwagBro9k> That was the original ending Woolie
[4:04:46] <dreadedcthulhu> oh god going backwards in the persona franchise is a nifhtmare
[4:04:46] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:04:55] <RunoEddie> P4 has so many finales
[4:05:05] <%DukeBlack_> original p4 didn't have January chat
[4:05:09] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Vanilla P4 never existed, ever
[4:05:23] <%DukeBlack_> [4G added January to Valentine's day
[4:05:38] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @woolieversus February and March and the Marie Marie storyline was added in Golden
[4:05:40] <+regis_j_rock> Vanilla P4 jumps from December to Marcg
[4:05:46] <+skyheys> Original P4 was better
[4:05:46] <CrematedCube> Games that "end" a half dozen times, sometimes amazing but sometimes tiresome
[4:05:51] <%DukeBlack_> Marchj was not added
[4:05:56] <%DatAsuna> Meanwhile, 0/5 F Morning. T_T
[4:05:57] <bryxobryx> I just got back what is this conversation in reference to?
[4:06:00] <%RioGascar> I am absolute opposite
[4:06:01] <megaman_sentinel> p3 was the same
[4:06:07] <pixel_river> P5 was streched
[4:06:08] <%ringabal> OH GEEZ
[4:06:08] <+regis_j_rock> January and February are Golden exclusive just like Royal
[4:06:08] <%RioGascar> I ran into this with god of war 2016
[4:06:09] <%RyTYoung> LUL
[4:06:09] <RunoEddie> I actually got baited in the original P4 to get the "normal" ending
[4:06:13] <sunnythedrunk> LUL
[4:06:17] <%yusefHD> Those god damn maps. Thank the WiiU version
[4:06:18] <%DukeBlack_> In the oriiginal you would skip to March
[4:06:19] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I know March wasnt added I meant the dungeon content
[4:06:26] <RunoEddie> never got the Real Ending
[4:06:30] <%RioGascar> Where it just kept going ENDINGS ABOUT TO HAPPEN RIGHT and then it pulls the rug out of underneath
[4:06:30] <%ChoculaUltra> oh god those triforce pieces in wind waker FeelsBadMan
[4:06:34] <CrematedCube> @bryxobryx Persona games and how all their false endings
[4:06:36] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Nah Triforce quest was fun
[4:06:37] <%jinking79> this is y u Play the Vanilla Ver of the games
[4:06:38] <Prevot> can you believe there's people who complain about WW HD reducing the triforce hunt
[4:06:42] <%DatAsuna> asscred 2 fetch quest before the final boss as well
[4:06:42] <+skyheys> Y E S, MONEY
[4:06:47] <%RyTYoung> I watched my friend looking around for those, he had no clue where to look at all...
[4:06:47] <+jiggy_snipe> nice analogy
[4:06:50] <+jiggy_snipe> Kappa
[4:06:57] <%ChoculaUltra> legit got the part where I had to find the triforce pieces and copied a friend's save who already did it because fuck all of that sailing, dude.
[4:07:01] <cosmicgoatee> He's not wrong. I hate games where you end ok but not peak story climax Kreygasm
[4:07:06] <%yusefHD> Skyward Sword friggin toe bean boss fight three times
[4:07:22] <+regis_j_rock> Torna The Golden Country
[4:07:24] <bryxobryx> Ah, I was hoping for one more chance to shoehorn in bug fables.
[4:07:30] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Woolie Plz NotLikeThis
[4:07:30] <+Disgrea> its the timestretch that made me play the original p4 instead, still totally content
[4:07:36] <+skyheys> Okami does it right
[4:07:39] <pixel_river> i thought okami ended 2 times
[4:07:41] <cosmicgoatee> pineapple bean was infuriating & the last boss of Skyward Sword didn't really make up for it
[4:07:48] <%yusefHD> @bryxobryx Shattered But Whole is better IMO
[4:07:49] <%DukeBlack_> Torna doesn't do this at all
[4:07:50] <BenGarcia8995> I agree it stretches a lot, but P4 did it pretty good in that Golden felt more natural than P3 in FES, where it added something it wasn't needed. But Royal added a lot of improvements that made the ending better.
[4:07:56] <bryxobryx> I think Okami actually does it well.
[4:07:57] <Rhinoprotoss> But you don't have 2 more months...
[4:07:59] <reonome> okami 2 is fine
[4:08:01] <%cobalt_phoenix_> what about nier automata
[4:08:11] <%hamahiroyuki> P3FES had at least a clear extra chapter isn't? not that I heard ever listened anything good about The Answer tho
[4:08:14] <+skyheys> Okami 2 is the best arc!
[4:08:14] <%yusefHD> LUL
[4:08:15] <%ozmon> LUL
[4:08:17] <cosmicgoatee> post Orochi....
[4:08:19] <+gnoame> What you don't want to fight Orochi 4 / 5 times
[4:08:19] <pixel_river> LUL
[4:08:19] <%NopeBadguy> LUL
[4:08:20] <+botchdogg> Okami 2 is my favorite part, Okami 3 is the lesser one
[4:08:21] <UltimateDomon> Okami 2 is Pat's favorite
[4:08:22] <BlackermanZX> LUL
[4:08:23] <%morgantj> Ryoshima coast is the best area though
[4:08:29] <reonome> do NOT play the anwser please
[4:08:35] <BlackermanZX> Okami never ends
[4:08:40] <RunoEddie> @hamahiroyuki then let me be the first, I did enjoy The Answer
[4:08:45] <CrematedCube> Okami did that well the first two endings, but the third ending is too much
[4:08:49] <%NopeBadguy> oh no not more content NotLikeThis
[4:08:50] <BenGarcia8995> @reonome The what? We don't talk about The Answer...
[4:08:56] <+skyheys> "Do not give me three games" - Woolie
[4:08:57] <%DatAsuna> converse: jhoto-kanto
[4:08:59] <+Allyofwar> I actually like how long plan I is. It's paced like how an actual ancient myth is paced.
[4:09:06] <+regis_j_rock> Hey Okami's second arc was fine, it was 3rd part that over stayed
[4:09:10] <%BallerSwagBro9k> ETERNAL CONTENT
[4:09:13] <+StrawberryPantsu> Yeo
[4:09:13] <pixel_river> play okmai folks
[4:09:16] <+StrawberryPantsu> *YEP
[4:09:17] <%BallerSwagBro9k> WHAAAAAAAAT
[4:09:23] <%BallerSwagBro9k> HERESY
[4:09:25] <%glass_marcus> Hollow Knight is just too much game
[4:09:25] <%yusefHD> Oh jesus that secret final boss
[4:09:29] <BlackermanZX> Okami is amazing
[4:09:31] <%RyTYoung> I felt that too...
[4:09:33] <+StrawberryPantsu> Uncharted 4
[4:09:34] <%NopeBadguy> I can understand that. Metroidvanias just sorta hit like that sometimes.
[4:09:35] <%glass_marcus> they went too hard
[4:09:38] <cosmicgoatee> Metroidvanias like Hollow Knight are great but that...114% killed it, especially boss rush insane mode
[4:09:41] <PortableBoredom> Hollow Knight is over rated, Bloodstained is better. You can't convince me otherwise.
[4:09:54] <%glass_marcus> @StrawberryPantsu Just beat this last weekend, couldn't agree more
[4:09:56] <bryxobryx> The South Park games are really padded out tho. Butthole might be better, but it still burns you out by the end.
[4:09:59] <Prevot> @PortableBoredom It's okay, you're allowed to be wrong.
[4:10:03] <tipsybirdw> for hallowknight I accidentally deleted the save on 112% havnt touched it since
[4:10:06] <%ChoculaUltra> bloodstained was the perfect length imo, Zangetsu mode is p solid too
[4:10:22] <%RyTYoung> Shit I need to try out Zangetsu mode
[4:10:25] <BenGarcia8995> Well, keep in mind that Hollow Knight's extra content is just that, extra. Although if u talking bout The White Palace... yeah it can be daunting.
[4:10:27] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> wHy dO pEoPle LikE cOnTeNt?!
[4:10:28] <cosmicgoatee> AND silksong
[4:10:32] <bryxobryx> Like they just keep going on and on.
[4:10:38] <tipsybirdw> @Prevot niceeeeeee
[4:10:42] <%ChoculaUltra> oh yeah, is Silksong out? Not trying to troll - legit haven't been keeping up
[4:10:44] <cosmicgoatee> hey Team Cherry puts in work at least
[4:10:47] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Personally if I'm having fun. I can play a game endlessly. Some long games are even so good that immediately new game plus them like Witcher 3
[4:10:48] <dizimous> I think Hollow knight's pacing is fine tbh
[4:10:50] <+StrawberryPantsu> Too much content can be bad
[4:10:52] <%gatorafan> RELEASE SILKSONG YOU COWARDS
[4:10:53] <tipsybirdw> silk song aint out yet
[4:10:54] <+skyheys> THE ANSWER SUCKS
[4:10:55] <+linSP> It’s a good bad thing to have
[4:11:00] <%huskarl_zap> respect
[4:11:04] <Drusain> we don't talk about fes around here
[4:11:05] <reonome> THE ANSWER DOESN'T EXIST
[4:11:10] <Rhinoprotoss> Woolie doesn't remember Persona 4...
[4:11:11] <%RyTYoung> LUL
[4:11:12] <BlackermanZX> Answer who
[4:11:12] <BenGarcia8995> You shouldn't play The Answer
[4:11:13] <sunnythedrunk> Fuck The Answer
[4:11:15] <Hammatime8> LUL
[4:11:24] <%Irridium> Xenoblade Chronicles Definitive edition did that as well. Big section is its own mode. Fucking A+
[4:11:29] <bryxobryx> Flopside Pit of 100 trials second run anyone?
[4:11:33] <PortableBoredom> I miss you, Door-kun
[4:11:33] <+skyheys> I can agree w/ that
[4:11:34] <%DatAsuna> Deus Ex also got worse when they forced missing link into the middle of the main game
[4:11:45] <RunoEddie> the fights in The Answer are cool
[4:11:50] <cosmicgoatee> Not spoiling but true Hollow Knighters survived the P.O.P. with their sanity intact
[4:11:50] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:11:52] <RunoEddie> the lore ehhhhh, not really
[4:11:52] <%hamahiroyuki> oh there you go LUL
[4:11:54] <bryxobryx> Sammer Guy tournament?
[4:12:02] <BlackermanZX> Never forget Door Kun FeelsBadMan
[4:12:07] <+skyheys> depends on the game
[4:12:08] <Drusain> Nier
[4:12:21] <sunnythedrunk> New Game Plus is when you LOVE the gameplay and want more
[4:12:22] <%ChoculaUltra> I've started to appreciate the games that have like a story/obj recap during loading screens.
[4:12:29] <%yusefHD> Chrono Jigga LUL
[4:12:30] <%doomerskeletor13> I did new game plus with Arkham City
[4:12:31] <%RyTYoung> DMC V was the fastest I hit new game again after beating it
[4:12:35] <+StrawberryPantsu> NieR
[4:12:36] <BenGarcia8995> But Woolie, u can't deny the improvements made in Royal. It added more screen time for certain characters, gameplay improvements, and stuff like that
[4:12:36] <+regis_j_rock> DMC does New Game great
[4:12:39] <+linSP> DS2 NG+
[4:12:39] <pixel_river> Re4 i my most new gameplussef game
[4:12:42] <%DatAsuna> Similar for dragon's dogma
[4:12:53] <+regis_j_rock> 999 is even NG+, that's just the game
[4:12:53] <%glass_marcus> You haven't beaten chrono trigger until you've beaten it 12 times
[4:12:58] <cosmicgoatee> New Game Plus works when you intentionally dont have much left to finish and you wanna get collectibles
[4:13:02] <Prevot> man 999 is so fucking good
[4:13:02] <RunoEddie> I got super hyped with that gauntlet at the end of The Answer, I just wish it had a FUCKING COMPENDIUM
[4:13:02] <bryxobryx> Bayonetta is a play over and over type game.
[4:13:08] <+StrawberryPantsu> VLR
[4:13:12] <Rhinoprotoss> Weird how a few of those aren't new game +
[4:13:16] <%yusefHD> Ring Fit Adventure has multiple NG+, pretty damn nuts tbh.
[4:13:24] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> What does Chrono Trigger have besides new endings?
[4:13:28] <%doomerskeletor13> Alan Wakes American Nightmare makes you play it three times to get the full story
[4:13:30] <reonome> I agree woolie
[4:13:32] <+skyheys> @yusefhd makes sense honestly
[4:13:33] <%cobalt_phoenix_> like sekiro?
[4:13:40] <%Chatterbox1991> play Serious Sam
[4:13:43] <%Chatterbox1991> it good
[4:13:49] <%yusefHD> @skyheys Yep - pretty fun skill trees too
[4:13:52] <reonome> i hate replaying games
[4:13:53] <tipsybirdw> Virgo vs the zodiac is a great game with like nobody talkign about it
[4:13:55] <%Chatterbox1991> cro team rules
[4:14:10] <%Chatterbox1991> serious dam 2 is godlike
[4:14:15] <+regis_j_rock> Super Metroid you can start and finish in an afternoon
[4:14:16] <CrematedCube> The Souls games are a rare example of a game I truly enjoy NG+
[4:14:17] <%Chatterbox1991> perfect for an lp
[4:14:20] <+linSP> I replay RE4 bioshock deus ex every year
[4:14:21] <+regis_j_rock> And it's great
[4:14:22] <%Chatterbox1991> highly recommend
[4:14:25] <%DukeBlack_> nah
[4:14:26] <Rhinoprotoss> No
[4:14:41] <+StrawberryPantsu> Star Fox 64 is a game you can beat in an hour
[4:14:44] <%Chatterbox1991> also salt
[4:14:47] <Macguffn> All I really care about is seeing Woolie experience Father Grigori
[4:14:49] <tipsybirdw> @WoolieVersus we allowed to recomend games to you?
[4:14:50] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Like Katamari lol
[4:14:51] <RunoEddie> Woolie has mentioned before that he doesn't replay anything, like Metal Gear
[4:14:56] <+jiggy_snipe> Woolie Vs New Things (that are actually old) Kappa
[4:14:58] <+skyheys> me
[4:14:58] <%DatAsuna> @StrawberryPantsu that reminds me, star fox assault
[4:14:59] <%RyTYoung> Not me
[4:15:00] <+StrawberryPantsu> I have
[4:15:05] <%ringabal> Here
[4:15:07] <%DatAsuna> I have
[4:15:10] <bryxobryx> Bug fables
[4:15:11] <SteelSnake93101> Me
[4:15:12] <%DatAsuna> Still not played left alive
