[0:01:48] <generalve> like exactl;y ?
[0:01:52] <generalve> LUL
[0:01:54] <%TheOneUpWarrior> @woolieversus wut up woolz?
[0:01:56] <VexicBayn> the troubles
[0:02:03] <+fatal_penguin_> Are you wearing pants, Woolie?
[0:02:06] <%TheOneUpWarrior> yessss
[0:02:11] <Dragon_Batman> Yea there has been some shit pushing
[0:02:17] <+dukenux> Everyone needs to git gud Kappa
[0:02:20] <+Hapsam> that kirby headset looks like kirby pooping soundwaves into woolies ears
[0:02:24] <+dukenux> so it was written... by miyazaki
[0:02:27] <mudamudajo> yo woolie! This game is kicking my ass nice and hard.
[0:02:30] <EBT93> The tip of the Platinumburg Kappa
[0:02:42] <VexicBayn> I've been inching through since last night and it's a lot of emptying your bitch cup
[0:02:43] <%TheOneUpWarrior> ran my head into a wall for 2 hrs before it clicked finally
[0:02:49] <Kyopheonix> its cuz it's not dark souls it's more like fromsoftwares old ip Tenchu c:
[0:02:54] <Dragon_Batman> At least you can start to work on them at least
[0:03:02] <%ChoculaUltra> friend of mine who works at a Gamestop in Manhattan said he's already taken 7 Sekiro returns today lmfao
[0:03:06] <+dukenux> Was thiking abotu that actually
[0:03:11] <VexicBayn> it's tenchuborne souls blood twice
[0:03:14] <EBT93> @choculaultra LUL
[0:03:24] <TrashLeviathan> am i late
[0:03:26] <+fatal_penguin_> I'm not a fan of Dark Souls, but how is this game?
[0:03:26] <%Youknowwhyimhere008> @ChoculaUltra atpRtsd
[0:03:28] <%TheOneUpWarrior> nightjar slash is great to get in and out of engagements
[0:03:28] <tag545> cyclopse grab from souls 2 is strong here
[0:03:34] <VexicBayn> anybidy find the moonlight greatsword yet?
[0:03:35] <%callowheart> Well you see ,if you all weren't scrubs and hopped on that Nioh train before this you would be ready for this game. Kappa
[0:03:41] <BusterRepukken> The ogre HATES fire
[0:03:45] <+dukenux> Is Sekiro really that difficult, or all the people who already got gud at Soulsborne have now trouble accomodating to different controls and gameplay
[0:03:58] <valriot> Its like Nioh x PunchOut, Nioh demands aggression
[0:04:00] <@mothmandraws> DO OR DIE
[0:04:08] <+dukenux> WE DIE IT
[0:04:08] <generalve> you can not get greedy at all in this game man....
[0:04:15] <MatTrix77> Robot arm + Katana + Grapple + Defensive gameplay = Woolie Game
[0:04:20] <+EySoyCoco> tbh the two main bosses i killed so far being agressive has paid off big time
[0:04:21] <@mothmandraws> gotta commit
[0:04:23] <Dragon_Batman> I believe
[0:04:26] <TrashLeviathan> this is just a better version of bloodbones parry imo @WoolieVersus
[0:04:34] <@mothmandraws> I should buy this
[0:04:38] <%QueequegTheater> Is Sekiro a character action
[0:04:42] <MayorRev> tilting is fine
[0:04:45] <+fatal_penguin_> Prepare your anus, everyones

[0:04:58] <%ChoculaUltra> I don't think it's hard, just brutal in every sense of the word. Mistakes aren't just mistakes, they're entire run enders.
