[0:04:51] <+QueequegTheater> @SoaringLettuce Just making the budget back isn't breaking even, you need to make 2.5 times

[0:05:05] <mr_sups> I think word of mouth will save it, but it won't do super well.
[0:05:08] <SoaringLettuce> everyone saying its a failure is pretending only @queequegtheater were one weekend in
[0:05:09] <%gatorafan> I mean, I still think he's fugly. Just not nightmare inducing
[0:05:11] <%Solidnick18> Sonic i might
[0:05:11] <dekkitout> Is sonic out yet?
[0:05:11] <%Irridium> I'll be real I didn't even know Birds of Prey came out. Not great marketing

[0:05:20] <+linSP> do you think theyll have beta sonic on the blueray release
[0:05:27] <a_mad_dragon> sonic is probably that highly rated because everyone set the bar for it so low
[0:05:38] <SoaringLettuce> @queequegtheater i was already writing something nevermind the first part

[0:09:07] <%Irridium> god I wish toei did that with android 21
[0:09:15] <+QueequegTheater> Thanks for the LuvSign @boxofhooligans
[0:09:17] <SilverInferno3> Plot that matters? In a fiighting game? What?
[0:09:27] <%boxofhooligans> Being in front of the monitor of the action on doom feels more excilarating (dont think that i spelled that right)
[0:09:32] <+SirGO0SE> 21 Kreygasm
[0:09:50] <+QueequegTheater> Okay but does this character check of the three dozen fetish boxes that 21 does
[0:09:52] <%boxofhooligans> @queequegtheater NP!
[0:09:57] <+sugardaddyvoid> @mechslayer71 I like mnk but wasn’t sure if it was more optimized or maybe would be more fun On a bigger scream. Can’t figure out where’d I’d wanna play
[0:10:19] <+SirGO0SE> that evo hockey jersey is fresh as fuck
[0:10:32] <+mechslayer71> @sugardaddyvoid you’ll have to wait for reviews to hear about optimization
[0:10:51] <SilverInferno3> Not rumors anymore
[0:10:51] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[0:11:48] <%RioGascar> No nero tho
[0:11:51] <+Freelance7> GUNSWORDTRICK
[0:11:51] <%RioGascar> So no care
[0:11:53] <+Javaa01> Or mod the PC version to get active style switching
[0:11:55] <+QueequegTheater> Won't this make 3 way easier?
[0:11:56] <%RioGascar> NERO OR NO BUY
[0:12:08] <+Estuko> the mod for dmc5 that applies coop is neat too

[0:12:24] <SilverInferno3> Better question is are these exclusive to Switch or is it coming to the ps4 version I bought a month before they announced all this
[0:12:28] <EpitaphTransmits> @WoolieVersus Have you played the Mobile/PC game Honkai Impact 3rd? And are you excited about the game coming up Genshin Impact coming out for the switch?
[0:12:28] <SoaringLettuce> 3 is gonna be bitch easy
[0:12:30] <%RioGascar> who cares about za lore implications
[0:12:31] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus On PC there is a style switch mod
[0:12:55] <sonofthedeepsouth> IN THE FIRST MEME
[0:12:56] <%RioGascar> i am wondering why they are doing this
[0:12:59] <%RioGascar> When dmc5 is out
[0:13:01] <unit24> I feel like 3 is going to be easier but also a lot more fun
[0:13:01] <sonofthedeepsouth> IN THE FIRST SHITPOST
[0:13:10] <%RioGascar> like...i will never go back to dmc3 now
[0:13:12] <SilverInferno3> I seriously doubt it'll break the game or anything, if Vergil wrecks you before the updates he'll still wreck you with the updates
[0:13:17] <%RioGascar> not when dmc5 exists
[0:13:29] <%boxofhooligans> Cause Dante for smash! and DMC 3 good game.
[0:13:30] <fairore> @riogascar it's for the switch dude cmonBruh
[0:13:35] <%Solidnick18> that's pretty cool
[0:13:42] <SilverInferno3> Ah yeah that's true, Co-op was already baked in there
[0:13:42] <Lancaster_H> @RioGascar i mean, people like it, it's not that hard and they're already releasing a new version anyway
[0:13:45] <+Premium_Heart> dmc 5 is so much harder on dmd

[0:43:11] <%Solidnick18> the pistol?
[0:43:11] <1matheuw> why tho
[0:43:15] <SilverInferno3> Pistol DansGame
[0:43:18] <+QueequegTheater> Maxed Siege Mode Kreygasm
[0:43:18] <ThousandDogs> Why not?
[0:43:21] <BallerSwagBro9k> BECAUSE COMPLETION
[0:43:26] <+QueequegTheater> @1matheuw he had the points
[0:43:28] <Lophostrix_> pistol is the best weapon stfu
[0:43:28] <$GoogleyGareth> regular shotgun's good for saving ammo and the grenade launcher
[0:43:29] <stanlychicken> Do pistol only
[0:43:34] <SilverInferno3> I mean its fine but there were better places to invest
[0:43:36] <froglorn> "So i've done a little grinding"
[0:43:40] <BlackermanZX> eh completed pistol can be useful
[0:43:42] <+JD0394> Maxed pistol is good on pc
[0:43:48] <%voodoolawyer> WhackyChiraqi subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! C O O M
[0:43:50] <NaturalGear> maxed super shotgun is really good
[0:43:53] <SilverInferno3> But why stun when you can SIEGE
[0:43:53] <+thotacon_tv> seige mode is life
[0:43:53] <fist_wizard_jay> Wow Woolie it looks like you went and got real HUGE
[0:44:01] <+Capta1n_H3nry> Thanks for the LuvCool @whackychiraqi
[0:44:01] <+QueequegTheater> @SilverInferno3 No there aren't, Siege Mode and Mobile turret are by far the best in the game
[0:44:04] <+ill_sage> pistol got mad ass disease
[0:44:05] <Daxalog> Pistol Stun for Rescources
[0:44:06] <+captain_elsewhere> i only upgrade the pistol for the challenge in that one level
[0:44:07] <+TheDankDemon> you can fly tho
[0:44:11] <%Solidnick18> but big gun fun
[0:44:11] <%FuqBoiSlim> just get headshots all the time 4Head
[0:44:12] <primaryfire> people who use the pistol are victims of stockholm syndrome
[0:44:13] <+QueequegTheater> NUMBER GO UP
[0:44:23] <chromdad> Use gun on demon
[0:44:25] <%Aeoneth> Pistol only good for staggering weak enemies
[0:44:27] <jorniev> yeah but you have to not upgared all the other shit
[0:44:35] <@Solidus_113> All movement comes from gauss
[0:44:39] <SilverInferno3> @QueequegTheater Still more fun stuff than the pistol
[0:44:44] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus The high level strat is a specific rune combination that gives you infinite mobile turret ammo
[0:44:46] <fist_wizard_jay> tbh
[0:44:47] <gustavozxd> highest level strat = shoot demons
[0:44:55] <ThousandDogs> Until they die
[0:44:56] <+Javaa01> From REALLY far away
[0:44:56] <+ill_sage> the final 2 tho...

[0:45:22] <siamzero94> amored offensive + a later rune a fuckin busted
[0:45:23] <%Solidnick18> woolieLORE
[0:45:37] <%voodoolawyer> I'm secretly hoping that Doom: Eternal reveals that the Doomslayer is actually either Jesus Christ of Nazereth, or a direct descendent
[0:45:40] <b_ikki> 25 a month
[0:45:40] <+captain_elsewhere> whad difficulty is this ?
[0:45:45] <+p4ntless> the pistol is kinda just there if you want to use it, it has no real practical purpose when every other weapon also has practically infinite ammo too
[0:45:47] <Vyneci> Normal

[0:45:50] <%BusterRepukken> @WhackyChiraqi itsOG Doomguy

[0:58:54] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus And it only works because they're too stupid to realize that it shouldn't work
[0:58:54] <Hawkbone_> They have powerful psionic abilities.
[0:58:54] <b_ikki> not false
[0:58:56] <derap41> Even just the normal warp is controlled by belief and emotion
[0:59:00] <Tyrrosh> ever seen an purple orc?
[0:59:03] <+kyh9> They don't understand engines, so they sit in carts and they start to become powered

[1:12:09] <%GeneralSCPatton> THAT BITCH
[1:12:09] <CoffeeSlice> :C
[1:12:10] <BlackermanZX> Becoming a Revenant only would be worth if you become the DOOT
[1:12:17] <Quent0nius> what a bitch
[1:12:28] <+Javaa01> Yeah, swapping mods is the last priority
[1:12:38] <Hawkbone_> Would you become a revenant? On one hand, sick jetpack with rocket launchers, on the other hand, you are forced to painfully become Paigebait
[1:12:42] <ThousandDogs> I'm pretty sure Olivia Pierce shut them all down when they started fighting Hell.
[1:12:44] <%voodoolawyer> Welcome to this wild Savannah, would you like to wear this sweater made out of delicious steaks?
[1:12:47] <%HollowedIdjit> yeah they didn't go 0-2, they got shot in the back on their way to the set
[1:12:57] <ThousandDogs> They're too in-tact to have been killed by demons.
[1:13:04] <+captain_elsewhere> betray your friends and family: fabulous prizes to be won
[1:13:07] <SilverInferno3> She wasn't a sick robot like you Sam
[1:13:10] <Bailey__gaming> oh did woolie find one of old doom 93 maps that are secrets in some levels
[1:13:26] <%Irridium> remote detonation is pretty good
[1:13:33] <%Aeoneth> Remote Det is real good
[1:13:34] <+tearfuldevil> he found some, @Bailey__gaming
[1:13:35] <@Solidus_113> Remote has good buffs
[1:13:43] <SilverInferno3> I like Remote better than Lock on tbh
[1:13:47] <Hawkbone_> He found all of them so far, only one or two on stream
[1:13:48] <%Aeoneth> Shoot then Alt-Fire
[1:14:04] <SilverInferno3> Useful for Pinkies
[1:14:10] <+p4ntless> kills pinkies real good
[1:14:10] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[1:14:49] <%Irridium> last one is basically two rockets in one. Pop it just before it hits and then the rocket will hit after. 2 in 1
[1:14:53] <SilverInferno3> Lessens damage, not negate it tho
[1:14:57] <ThousandDogs> USE IT AS A MELEE WEAPON WOOLZ
[1:15:07] <+OneGorillionDollars> @WoolieVersus remote detonation is good because if fully upgraded and you detonate right before you hit you essentially get double damage
[1:15:39] <Hawkbone_> What do you guys think is the most fuckable demon in this game?

[1:29:26] <%voodoolawyer> Doom looks fun as hell. Will I understand the game if I've never seen the movie?
[1:29:34] <%Solidnick18> your dead
[1:29:45] <SilverInferno3> @peachy996 Very annoying in arcade mode
[1:29:45] <peachy996> @WhackyChiraqi Yes
[1:29:47] <ThousandDogs> nah dude you gotta know what The Rock said
[1:29:48] <@Solidus_113> You gotta balance between using the remote and not
[1:29:52] <+Neoepochx> This is one of the more difficult challenges.
[1:29:55] <@Solidus_113> pick and choose on the spot
[1:29:56] <+Neoepochx> to be fair
[1:29:57] <+captain_elsewhere> this isnt a squaresoft game WhackyChiraqi why are youasking that question elaC /
[1:29:59] <+captain_elsewhere> ?
[1:29:59] <+SirGO0SE> @WhackyChiraqi LUL
[1:30:01] <+o_almighty_1> Don’t focus on one enemy, shoot and keep moving to any enemy in the area
[1:30:02] <%jepupu> You should be able to hear the Quakeman jump while hopping in this map
[1:30:08] <Hawkbone_> Unfortunately, no. You need to see the movie to understand the game, The Rock shows up later and it doesn't make any sense unless you saw the movie
[1:30:11] <mr_miyagucci> @whackychiraqi yes the movie was based on the old games
[1:30:15] <%jepupu> Jumping for rockets definitely would help
[1:30:16] <peachy996> In fact not watching the movie is recommended
[1:30:18] <+Javaa01> @WhackyChiraqi You don't need to watch the movie, but the Novelizations are required reading Kappa
[1:30:26] <ThousandDogs> spoilers: Samuel Hayden was The Rock the whole time
[1:30:26] <SilverInferno3> A direct hit does more damage than just a detonation yeah?
[1:30:32] <%voodoolawyer> what about the japanese stage play?
[1:30:40] <Blackjackal95> Don't forget the comic
[1:30:42] <ThousandDogs> the musical or the non-musical
[1:30:46] <peachy996> Poor Rock, I remember he was so excited to talk about the BFG with Jon Stewart
[1:30:47] <ThousandDogs> important distinction
[1:30:47] <+SirGO0SE> read the manga imo
[1:30:51] <@Solidus_113> NICE

[1:31:04] <%Solidnick18> Ayeee
[1:31:08] <%shivvey> Yeee
[1:31:14] <%DensityD> DICKULOUS.
[1:31:15] <+Javaa01> Except your armor max right now is 75
[1:31:16] <SilverInferno3> Just keep that training with you
[1:31:16] <+captain_elsewhere> need to upgrade your armour to maximise
[1:31:17] <whazat> you only need... 100 armor
[1:31:17] <%shivvey> woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE
[1:31:17] <%DensityD> oops wait
[1:31:18] <dekkitout> Wrrry-diculous
[1:31:18] <%Haarute> you gotta upgrade armor though
[1:31:19] <RyanTheRecluse> Nice
[1:31:19] <BlackermanZX> Upgraded is even better
[1:31:21] <gunsrlove> He doesn't have 100 armour tho
[1:31:22] <+Javaa01> So no infinite armor right now
[1:31:27] <StarlitStunner> doodBait
[1:31:28] <+Mtome> doodLewd
[1:31:30] <%DensityD> don't. get. touched.
[1:31:30] <%voodoolawyer> infinite pistol ammo
[1:31:31] <+paladinstarbuster> its cuz your a scrub
[1:31:31] <+OmegaWeltall> Das a good rune
[1:31:32] <@Solidus_113> but the other armour runes help
[1:31:33] <ghostspartan80> get armor upgrades
[1:31:37] <%DensityD> pistol-chan
[1:31:39] <%GeneralSCPatton> @whackychiraqi BOTH MOVIES ARE NEGA-CANON
[1:31:40] <+SirGO0SE> upgrade armor to upgrade ammo
[1:31:40] <%DensityD> <3
[1:31:44] <Hawkbone_> If he upgrades the rune it lowers to 75
[1:31:51] <leonheartgriever> he may not like saving throw rune trial
[1:31:55] <SilverInferno3> I mean it's the same radius as on impact
[1:31:57] <RyanTheRecluse> Self detonation allows for better strafing around pillars
[1:32:02] <+DesertPenguin> Yea, then use the armor rune and never run out ever
[1:32:05] <ThousandDogs> @GeneralSCPatton don't actually give a real answer, this is Twitch chat
[1:32:15] <%DensityD> what emblem is on woolie's hoodie?
[1:32:22] <jorniev> woolie keeps using those close quarter long range missiles
[1:32:28] <+DesertPenguin> Rich Get Richer, Armored, and the one that gives more ammo for glory kills, so if you don't have infinite you get ammo back
[1:32:29] <%voodoolawyer> @DensityD Reboot
[1:32:37] <unit24> woolie no
[1:32:40] <siamzero94> Combined with armored offensive it's ludicrous
[1:32:40] <SilverInferno3> @DesertPenguin EVO, or Evolution Fighting Game Tournament
[1:32:43] <unit24> why equip the rune you can't even use
[1:32:44] <%croxeye> no, it's EVO
[1:32:47] <+Javaa01> You don't have 100 Armor Cap tho
[1:32:49] <@Solidus_113> you can cheese this out by slightly damaging yourself and picking up the extra armour on the floor
[1:32:49] <%BusterRepukken> you cant even use that rune
[1:32:50] <+DesertPenguin> What about Evo?
[1:32:53] <%BusterRepukken> you dont have 100 armor
[1:32:54] <+Javaa01> So it's practically worthless right now
[1:32:54] <whazat> combined with the Equipment Rune and Siphon Grenade, it's insane
[1:33:02] <mr_miyagucci> I sat in a chat where someone unitonically asked if sfv was realistic and based on the sf movie with van damme
[1:33:04] <+TheDankDemon> 100 woolz
[1:33:11] <SilverInferno3> @DesertPenguin Whoops my bad, meant to tag someone else lol
[1:33:12] <%BusterRepukken> woolie you cant even use it
[1:33:14] <unit24> woolie just depowered himself
[1:33:15] <%GeneralSCPatton> He can work towards the upgrade and make it work without 100 cap
[1:33:18] <BlackermanZX> too bad you cant go over 75 right now
[1:33:18] <BallerSwagBro9k> Oh yeah u only have 75
[1:33:19] <jorniev> ARMOR AT 100
[1:33:20] <Lightraven_> Lmao
[1:33:22] <+Neoepochx> He needs another argent core
[1:33:23] <mr_miyagucci> I make no presumptions after that experience
[1:33:26] <siamzero94> next upgrade should be after next fight
[1:33:28] <@Solidus_113> argent cell
[1:33:31] <Hawkbone_> Damage yourself and pick up that armor
[1:33:35] <jorniev> YOU ONLY HAVE 75 CAPSTONE
[1:33:36] <+Javaa01> Then equip it once you get one
[1:33:36] <+Neoepochx> cell*

[1:38:53] <%GeneralSCPatton> Grind that shit with self-damage
[1:38:55] <%voodoolawyer> at least it wasn't as bad as QA
[1:39:03] <+Javaa01> Even if you lose 5 armor and fill it, it counts as progress, so if you find a lot of armor you can't use, you could just slightly damage yourself with the splash of a regular nade and farm it like that as well
[1:39:05] <+JD0394> Forgot each shard gives 5 armor on this difficulty
[1:39:21] <SilverInferno3> There's a big of an armor pile after this figh ttoo
[1:39:22] <+JD0394> Always thought they only gave 1

[2:13:37] <siamzero94> look at walls
[2:13:40] <+wardenofwinter> Nope, if the doom slayer kills a demon he absorbs the hell energy making it impossible for them to come back. That’s why they fear him he is the permanent death
[2:13:42] <ArkSeaside> you gotta sneak in
[2:13:48] <@Solidus_113> remember to look up

[2:14:10] <dekkitout> Dear god, Doomguy follows sword logic- how fitting
[2:14:27] <%Solidnick18> last rune
[2:14:28] <@Solidus_113> last trial
[2:14:28] <Saltmeisterr> sword logic?
[2:14:40] <%voodoolawyer> Doomguy even follows the same 'guardian throne world' threat as Destiny. He can't die unless we, the player, die
[2:14:40] <ThousandDogs> Doomguy is a silent protagonist.
[2:14:40] <siamzero94> 1 health
[2:14:47] <+JeluxDaCasual> THE SWORD LOGIC!!
[2:14:52] <+Javaa01> Extra life basically
[2:14:55] <dekkitout> It's a Destiny thing, look it up
[2:14:56] <+DesertPenguin> Never used this
[2:15:00] <KnightAsteran> @saltmeisterr the strength of whatever you kill is added to yours
[2:15:09] <Saltmeisterr> neat
[2:15:10] <+DesertPenguin> I never used this because I never beat the trial. It's a hard one
[2:15:13] <random_moo> I used this on Boss’s
[2:15:15] <joniroquai> Good luck
[2:15:17] <+TheBigTaco> wrong
[2:15:27] <%KeslGames> KeslGames subscribed with Twitch Prime.
[2:15:28] <siamzero94> no no but siege mode gets you killed here
[2:15:35] <+linSP> i dont think this rune would be very useful on nightmare
[2:15:35] <resloxxx> Gracias por el LuvBlondeR, @keslgames.
[2:15:36] <%voodoolawyer> Sword Logic is from destiny, it's basically willpower so intense that you carve the weakness from the universe and add it's strength to yours. The sword implies that if you CAN kill it, it deserved to die. The final shape of the universe will be the strongest thing of the universe

[2:16:51] <ArkSeaside> also, Woolie, when you have the ammo drop rune, you can occasionally get BFG ammo from dude. Keep an eye out for those, because they're free room clears.
[2:16:52] <%croxeye> anybody tell him about the Icon of SIn?
[2:16:53] <spooksy> dont siege, you cant sit still here

[2:17:09] <joniroquai> You gotta keep moving constantly

[2:18:37] <+Javaa01> Glory kills are worthless in this challenge
[2:18:47] <ElPlasa> BRUH
[2:18:48] <Count_Long> What he needs to pick up are his balls, cause hes getting bodied
[2:18:49] <+DesertPenguin> It's just not worth it

[2:19:16] <joniroquai> Shoot the imp immediately
[2:19:17] <+DiabloDeAzul> tbh glory kills are a garbage mechanic which was solved WAY back in Final Fantasy X with overkills
[2:19:23] <%Aeoneth> big guy comes right away
[2:19:36] <%gatorafan> just don't get hit 4Head
[2:19:40] <siamzero94> now siege
[2:19:45] <+BNPhone> EU aim Kappa
[2:19:45] <ArkSeaside> that's an entirely different genre how does that apply
[2:20:06] <+thackattack00> "Glory kills are a garbage mechanic" LUL
[2:20:11] <%BusterRepukken> this rune aint worth it
[2:20:12] <Archmortal> more shooting less careful

[2:20:15] <%KeslGames> NO time to waste woolie
[2:20:15] <invader_rin> Gotta keep moving, gotta keep kiling.
[2:20:17] <%jepupu> 3 start
[2:20:20] <%KeslGames> get the littles, hit the big
[2:20:24] <joniroquai> The spectre is the last big enemy
[2:20:26] <you_violated_the_law____> uhh wow what low tier gaming skills
[2:20:28] <Vyneci> Spectres? monkaS
[2:20:29] <ArkSeaside> you start off aiming at an imp, kill that, use the pillar as cover from the caco to kill the soldier, then take the caco out
[2:20:33] <random_moo> This rune is worth it for Bosses
[2:20:47] <random_moo> zoneSmug
[2:20:47] <you_violated_the_law____> you should join my fortnite training camp
[2:20:48] <+DesertPenguin> Not really
[2:20:50] <%BusterRepukken> its really not
[2:20:50] <+DesertPenguin> I never used it and did just fine
[2:20:55] <+DesertPenguin> Maybe it's good for higher difficulties
[2:20:56] <+Javaa01> You can charge siege if an enemy is spawning in
[2:21:00] <rsg220> it aint about the rune, dog, it's about the prestige
[2:21:02] <+TheBigTaco> Imagine complaining about glory kills
[2:21:03] <siamzero94> so what? let him try
[2:21:08] <%KeslGames> IN DA FACE
[2:21:12] <random_moo> @desertpenguin For CD
[2:21:13] <+DiabloDeAzul> @thackattack00 they're GoW style cutscenes that make you invincible, and don't have tactical advantage like throws in a beat-em-up
[2:21:16] <masterfire23> Fragged
[2:21:20] <+thackattack00> LUL LUL LUL
[2:21:21] <+DesertPenguin> CD?
[2:21:24] <+DesertPenguin> Yea, no
[2:21:28] <georgian52> not me, us
[2:21:34] <+DesertPenguin> Again, I never used got it and beat the game
[2:21:42] <+thackattack00> Being invincible is a pretty big tactical advantage I'd say
[2:21:47] <peachy996> When you have a chance for Siege against Cacodemon or Hell Knight why not take it
[2:21:48] <+DesertPenguin> CD is super easy with holograms, Siege Mode, and Turret Mode
[2:21:49] <+thackattack00> Plus they heal you
[2:21:49] <random_moo> It helps just to keep the flow
[2:21:50] <spooksy> you can do it!
[2:21:51] <Hawkbone_> Glory kills are actually a genius way to encourage aggressiveness in this gam'e
[2:21:52] <+DiabloDeAzul> They literally waste your time and bruttal doom allowed you to turn them off, that's how pointless it was
[2:21:52] <+Javaa01> If you're playing on a high difficulty, you don't need Saving Throw
[2:21:54] <BlackermanZX> imagine not loving the glory kills
[2:21:57] <ThousandDogs> there's no tactical advantage to forcing enemies to spawn health
[2:21:57] <%FuqBoiSlim> dang...
[2:21:59] <BlackermanZX> just imagine
[2:22:01] <ThousandDogs> hold the L you chud
[2:22:02] <siamzero94> Siege caco immediately
[2:22:06] <+theuselessace> they are also a heal unlik gow
[2:22:08] <1matheuw> the caco hit you
[2:22:22] <random_moo> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[2:22:26] <rsg220> It's not about the RUNE. IT"S ABOUT THE RIDE
[2:22:27] <joniroquai> There's no healing from glory kills in this challenge
[2:22:28] <ArkSeaside> good good
[2:22:30] <spooksy> hold the L not hold L
[2:22:32] <ArkSeaside> do that start
[2:22:38] <Ashenik1> "After you deal with the Caco the pinky shall come in" Kappa
[2:22:39] <peachy996> I like that you can turn the blue/orange glow off
[2:22:48] <+BurkeBigsby> Does this Doom have a dash?
[2:22:50] <+o_almighty_1> You missed super hard
[2:22:55] <Charronia> Instant whiff punish
[2:22:56] <RyanTheRecluse> Getting through this trial is an indicator you can get through nightmare
[2:23:06] <Count_Long> Have you tried SHOOTING the enemies?
[2:23:16] <Brodius> Use the right stick more. You're aiming with your legs more than your arms.
[2:23:22] <+thesyndrome> so close
[2:23:24] <+aceleapc> "mechanic the game is based around is pointless" lmfao LUL
[2:23:30] <giga_bit> Woolie struggling so hard with the strafe shots
[2:23:30] <+DiabloDeAzul> @Hawkbone_ a better solution to fix campers would be to make the MONSTERS more aggressive and work together in groups to get rid of circle strafing
[2:23:31] <resloxxx> Clear the adds and then you can use siege mode
[2:23:32] <+tearfuldevil> yeah, what brodius said

[2:24:56] <Count_Long> udon is eh
[2:24:59] <Count_Long> but hey
[2:25:00] <masterfire23> just shoot them 4Head
[2:25:02] <Count_Long> soup is always a win
[2:25:06] <Hawkbone_> "Glory kills are pointless" is quite possibly the worst take I've seen regarding this game

[2:25:19] <peachy996> gettin awfully close to that cacodemon

[2:25:32] <+DiabloDeAzul> @Hawkbone_ I still say Brutal doom already solved this problem, and in OG doom camping wasn't even a problem

[2:29:16] <sunsetserenity1> *rune
[2:29:16] <+DiabloDeAzul> @TheBigTaco I'm saying that it's a feature many players overlook because (like woolie, for example) because it's a speedbump that has to be abused for i-frames, because if they took out the i-frames, nobody would do it because not getting hit is a better option despite the ammo loss not doing the glory kill
[2:29:19] <Brodius> @Lion_kun Only on the higher difficulties though
[2:29:20] <Jolly_Adventurer> Would cutting this part in the video be King Crimson or The Hand?
[2:29:25] <+linSP> psaDab first try coming up

[2:30:58] <Count_Long> DISRESPECT
[2:30:59] <BlackermanZX> BODIED BY AN IMP
[2:30:59] <+Balkespower> IMPD
[2:31:01] <peachy996> It's the No Clip Imp
[2:31:01] <Brodius> REGGIE! YOU JINXED IT
[2:31:01] <ArkSeaside> the last guy gets outlined in red through walls
[2:31:02] <vincerocmm> shitred sonic
[2:31:03] <+DesertPenguin> Usually on the perimeter if you can't find them
[2:31:06] <1matheuw> IMPATIENCE
[2:31:07] <+DiabloDeAzul> @theuselessace chat asked me why I thought glory kills were pointless, so I answered
[2:31:08] <peachy996> Imp'd
[2:31:11] <+BNPhone> i can feel the soul being torn out of his body
[2:31:13] <+therabbles> that Imp was a savior to his people
[2:31:14] <%Solidnick18> shhh
[2:31:18] <BlackermanZX> That was THE run
[2:31:28] <+TheBigTaco> @DiabloDeAzul okay, but the scenarios in which you are low health and scramble to find a goon to glory kill allows for tense momnents in the gameplay that keep it interesting. plus it uh... looks cool man
[2:31:31] <+o_almighty_1> Somebody’s get fuuuuuuuuuuucked LUL LUL LUL LUL
[2:31:36] <%Solidnick18> it was all reggies fault Kappa
[2:31:36] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1227284596695404550?s=19

[2:32:03] <peachy996> Cuz he bites you
[2:32:05] <Brodius> Siege the Coco
[2:32:07] <Hawkbone_> Glory kills are so obviously not pointless, its a major mechanic that plays a big role in combat, but not big enough that if you want to ignore it, you can.
[2:32:09] <%KeslGames> Woolie is just showcasing all the unique death animations! Yeah!
[2:32:15] <ghostspartan80> siege the cac asap
[2:32:16] <1matheuw> nothing is removed as far as i know

[2:32:39] <Count_Long> That imp is a badass
[2:32:41] <spooksy> almost got it
[2:32:41] <+DiabloDeAzul> @TheBigTaco Not so satisfying when you do them the thousandth time, they have a powerup where you cut the animation by half because they can't have enough animations to justify it
[2:32:41] <%Solidnick18> forget*
[2:32:42] <BlackermanZX> The Imp god

[2:34:32] <Brodius> Saving throw is the last
[2:34:42] <Hawkbone_> @DiabloDeAzul So just don't do them if you have such a huge problem with it. They literally have an option to turn off the blue/orange glow.
[2:34:42] <%shivvey> !MOTIVATED
[2:34:42] <@Moobot> 644 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[2:34:43] <RyanTheRecluse> Nice, though the rune is kinda useless on your current difficulty.
[2:34:46] <ghostspartan80> saving throw gonna come handy soon
[2:34:48] <+thesyndrome> !uptime
[2:34:48] <%Solidnick18> lol
[2:34:48] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 50 minutes
[2:34:51] <vincerocmm> here i come ruffer then rthe rest ofthem
[2:34:59] <spooksy> whatever makes you feel better scrub <3
[2:35:00] <+Balkespower> Now I am motivated!
[2:35:01] <+Giggalith> !MOTIVATED
[2:35:04] <+TheBigTaco> theres always room for scrubbiness
[2:35:08] <%Solidnick18> you know your limits
[2:35:09] <SilverInferno3> Can you tell my parents that
[2:35:10] <%BusterRepukken> that rune is for higher difficulties
[2:35:11] <+theuselessace> @diablodeazul but guns get just as unsatisfying after repeated use. the point of glory kills are variety and a way to heal
[2:35:11] <RyanTheRecluse> You’re now ready for Nightmare
[2:35:27] <ArkSeaside> when you die it goes into a slow motion mode for a bit
[2:35:29] <Djinnazz> Unless your #1
[2:35:29] <+Javaa01> The game goes into slowmo when you die with Saving Throw, you'll know when it's active
[2:35:32] <Brodius> Did Woolie ever get the upgrade module from the Argent Facility?
[2:35:36] <ghostspartan80> Nightmare is basically that challenge as a playthough
[2:35:36] <+Balkespower> You mean Ultra-Nightmare Kappa
[2:35:48] <@Solidus_113> that works
[2:35:49] <ArkSeaside> next time that happens just whip out the BFG
[2:35:50] <%Haarute> yeyeye
[2:35:55] <Hawkbone_> Its not off
[2:35:57] <+thackattack00> it isnt off just reduced
[2:35:57] <+Javaa01> Self damage is REDUCED
[2:35:58] <+BNPhone> reduced
[2:35:58] <ArkSeaside> no its just reduced
[2:35:59] <%GeneralSCPatton> SELF DAMAGE IS REDUCED
[2:36:09] <ghostspartan80> REDACTED
[2:36:12] <RyanTheRecluse> Reduced
[2:36:18] <+DiabloDeAzul> @Hawkbone_ did you forget the demons get back up if you don't do a glory kill? You can't ignore the mechanic because not only that, but some runes NEED it, turning off color flashes doesn't help
[2:36:19] <1matheuw> cluster bomb is cool
[2:36:32] <samuelfisk> Woolie is Mr Burns “Indestructible”
[2:36:33] <Hawkbone_> @DiabloDeAzul Shoot them, dummy.
[2:36:35] <+Javaa01> You don't need to max out Dexterity, it's just for Mod swapping
[2:36:45] <Hawkbone_> You have a gun
[2:36:50] <Brodius> It's a shame that you already have the Super Shotgun by the time you can max out the Combat Shotgun
[2:36:56] <%HollowedIdjit> IT'S TIME. FOR YA BOI
[2:37:01] <Hawkbone_> HE IS HERE.

[2:38:16] <%Solidnick18> SourPls
[2:38:20] <Hawkbone_> @DiabloDeAzul Yes, the demons don't get more health, they just do more damage and have more complex patterns.
[2:38:25] <Brodius> Quad shot is so strong
[2:38:26] <Saltmeisterr> SourPls
[2:38:32] <ralphfromdk> This room is one of the best in the game, it's just pure arena with so many levels.

[2:39:10] <+thesyndrome> LUL
[2:39:12] <ralphfromdk> That's one big ass needle

[2:40:01] <+Javaa01> The portals are there because this is a vidya, and it really doesn't matter why they're there
[2:40:02] <BallerSwagBro9k> SourPls
[2:40:23] <+DiabloDeAzul> @theuselessace I liked the chainsaw better when it was an actual weapon than a 1-use bat for a blood pinata
[2:40:34] <Brodius> Woolie is having so much fun switching guns.
[2:40:45] <Hawkbone_> The chainsaw was completely useless in OG Doom and serves to kill you more often than it'd help.
[2:40:52] <%Aeoneth> It's basically FPS Style switching
[2:41:03] <Brodius> lul
[2:41:06] <ArkSeaside> BFG

[2:50:17] <+DiabloDeAzul> @artoflec I literally gave a flaw about how glory kills take too long with invincibility, and everyone's going "no u". Zoomers just want to bury the past and pretend that the past shouldn't exist

[2:51:40] <SainEdge> SourPls
[2:51:44] <Malucoblz02> Here the thing, the game implies that the more Doomguy kills the stronger he gets, doenst that makes him, at least in part, a demon?

[2:52:21] <Tucker0603> the huge red ones
[2:52:28] <%Aeoneth> you need a platform to do DfAs. Double jump doesn't let you get high enough
[2:52:29] <+DiabloDeAzul> @Hawkbone_ All I did was explain my point because everyone thinks it's a bad point. This isn't even how they got rid of mods in exchange for vulkan support, and OG doom has MUCH better dev tools that 2016 ever could
[2:52:32] <%BusterRepukken> all this because they killed a rabbit
[2:52:34] <@Solidus_113> Back to Damnation

[2:53:05] <%Solidnick18> Djently
[2:53:08] <%jiggy_snipe> LUL
[2:53:14] <Brodius> Imagine hating a game from not being like the game you played when you were a child.
[2:53:14] <@Squdnate> But does it djent?
[2:53:18] <ihaveahugepersonality> Do you even Djent bro?
[2:53:18] <bubblegumcrisis2040> rock is for grandpas
[2:53:19] <BallerSwagBro9k> The Midwest is about 50 years in the past mentally
[2:53:20] <dekkitout> If anything, Ska came from hell
[2:53:21] <@Squdnate> DJEN DJEN DJEN DJEN
[2:53:23] <Hawkbone_> @DiabloDeAzul You explaining your point only made it worse. You say zoomers want to erase the past, but yet you're a boomer that wants erase the present.
[2:53:25] <Ipsenscastle> wtf is djent?
[2:53:29] <DaBigVitus> djent is for tech death hipsters LUL
[2:53:31] <joniroquai> You gotta shotgun the lost souls to catapult them
[2:53:35] <+DesertPenguin> Use your SIPHON GRENADES to get armor back so you can enjoy your infinite ammo
[2:53:37] <+gryffon95> never played doom. but i respect it. and the people that play it. and love the lore
[2:53:37] <1matheuw> thats fart gases
[2:53:52] <SilverInferno3> He made it SO FAR
[2:53:53] <dukenux> It wasnt even about proper Black/Death Metal bands, iirc Def Leppard felt under Satanic Panic

[2:54:35] <+chase959> shoot it
[2:54:37] <+Balkespower> Large Heart fit for heavy
[2:54:37] <BallerSwagBro9k> Thats kinda big to be a heart
[2:54:37] <%DensityD> that was larger than a cow heart
[2:54:38] <+thesyndrome> @WoolieVersus that heart on a pedastal is a reference to the OG doom
[2:54:40] <Hawkbone_> Well, thats one way to do ut
[2:54:42] <SilverInferno3> Lol that's the worst way to do it but it works
[2:54:43] <rcand9> goof work
[2:54:45] <@Squdnate> @Ipsenscastle It's a subgenre of progressive death metal, where instead of melodic guitar strings, it's rythm.
[2:54:46] <+YabbaTroll> whatever works
[2:55:03] <SilverInferno3> One day Woolie will learn how Pinkies work, but not today
[2:55:13] <Brodius> That Imp got a few good hits in
[2:55:32] <BallerSwagBro9k> Doom Eternal is still 1 month away FeelsBadMan
[2:55:35] <anne_arkie> bonk'd
[2:55:37] <+thesyndrome> that greande was accidentally sick

[2:56:17] <+thesyndrome> I love how woolie is coming to realize that Doom is basically the Devil May Cry of FPS games
[2:56:18] <+VanaSkiller> jdotkdLUL
[2:56:19] <@Squdnate> @DiabloDeAzul Be nice
[2:56:21] <BlackermanZX> Aaaand gone

[2:56:26] <+BNPhone> he got snapped
[2:56:27] <+theuselessace> LOL
[2:56:32] <Brodius> @DiabloDeAzul Why are you even here?
[2:56:34] <Malucoblz02> @BallerSwagBro9k we getting Bayonetta and vanqish next week, and in 2, Megaman Zero collection, did that brought a smile on?
[2:56:35] <+Eightesu> what was that comment
[2:56:38] <+TheBigTaco> well what woolie just did was a pretty good argument for glory kills lol
[2:56:42] <+Balkespower> the Charging pinkies take more damage when you hit their back.
[2:56:49] <+DiabloDeAzul> @Squdnate I apologize for the ad hominem.
[2:56:53] <+Javaa01> Nah, just environmental detail
[2:56:55] <joniroquai> Syndrome wouldn't Bullsetstorm count too?
[2:56:56] <+BNPhone> wish reggie would give me a 30 second timeout
[2:56:56] <peachy996> Fight about it elsewhere
[2:57:01] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @ZComiX
[2:57:02] <BallerSwagBro9k> @Malucoblz02 it helps FeelsAmazingMan
[2:57:02] <peachy996> Use whispers
[2:57:08] <Brodius> Burst
[2:57:09] <%Aeoneth> Charge burst is good
[2:57:09] <+Javaa01> Both kinda suck
[2:57:10] <SilverInferno3> For real guys I have no stake in this argument but I hate seeing all of it, let's just have a good time ripping and tearing, bullets or fists
[2:57:12] <Hawkbone_> Boomers out here searching desperately for things to hate about NuDOOM
[2:57:15] <+DiabloDeAzul> @Brodius Pissing in the wind because I'm bored, I mean why are you here?
[2:57:24] <+BNPhone> COD of Duty
[2:57:24] <dukenux> scopes in doom Kappa
[2:57:25] <awalr> cod mod
[2:57:25] <+YabbaTroll> my sweet baby charged burst being picked last :(
[2:57:35] <rcand9> why you have to be mad is only a game
[2:57:40] <Brodius> @DiabloDeAzul Watching the stream instead of arguing with chat
[2:57:44] <Hawkbone_> @DiabloDeAzul If you hate this game so much then why are you watching a stream of people who love it so much?
[2:57:44] <dukenux> this does feel like a bone for tacticool shooter crowd
[2:57:45] <+firmlygraspi1> the scope is excellent
[2:57:50] <psychoteletubby7> scope was good for early game. fell off later
[2:57:55] <Charronia> Chainsaw only run
[2:58:00] <SilverInferno3> Scope ain't bad, not as destructive but can be fun
[2:58:17] <+linSP> burst is great dps but only up close
[2:58:21] <Brodius> Scope is good for headshots in earlier stages
[2:58:22] <+firmlygraspi1> its kills
[2:58:23] <%BusterRepukken> scope is gonna be way better in Eternal
[2:58:26] <+DesertPenguin> Scope has it's place if you wanna thin the crowd before going all in
[2:58:28] <Spirit_NB> Scope was surprisingly useful in nightmare. ammo efficient
[2:58:32] <+JD0394> Fully upgraded scope one shots human sized enemies on a headshot. Great weapon on m+kb
[2:58:33] <+DesertPenguin> Exactly
[2:58:33] <+DiabloDeAzul> @Hawkbone_ I like woolie, and nothing else was on. It was only one piss take, I was just defending my opinion
[2:58:34] <bubblegumcrisis2040> 50 hedgeogs
[2:58:35] <BaslerJones> has woolie ever beaten the original doom ?
[2:58:36] <+DesertPenguin> Ammo efficient
[2:58:43] <@Squdnate> @ZComiX Try and post the clip again
[2:58:51] <SonofMelonHead> Scope really chews up imps.
[2:58:52] <peachy996> Scope is good for the early platforming section where the Imps annoy you
[2:58:55] <Saltmeisterr> full auto is a way better mod that burst
[2:58:58] <+YabbaTroll> @BaslerJones this is probablt the <10th fps he's played
[2:58:59] <graemecrackers1> for whom the bell tolls!
[2:58:59] <SilverInferno3> @JD0394 Don't most weapons do that tho
[2:59:01] <BallerSwagBro9k> THE VOCALS Kreygasm
[2:59:11] <Hawkbone_> @DiabloDeAzul I like Woolie too, but if he's playing a game I hate, I don't go into his Twitch chat and start arguments with people with my bad takes.
[2:59:14] <BaslerJones> @YabbaTroll then we most
[2:59:24] <BaslerJones> must get him to play*
[2:59:27] <graemecrackers1> The Metal will never die
[2:59:30] <Brodius> That poor skeleot
[2:59:40] <Blackjackal95> Eternal looks insanely smooth/refined, it's crazy
[2:59:41] <Brodius> He finally learned how to kill a Pinkie
[2:59:42] <+BNPhone> EZ Clap
[2:59:45] <BonemanShow> That mastery challenge is way easier on older levels @woolieversus
[2:59:46] <SilverInferno3> Holy shit Woolie learned how to fight Pinkies
[2:59:52] <%jepupu> Headshots are good on weaklings.
[2:59:52] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:59:55] <SilverInferno3> Praise Satan
[2:59:57] <ohnoitspooba> Olé
[3:00:01] <Brodius> Thank you Satan
[3:00:04] <presque> He's in the zone
[3:00:06] <dukenux> TOASTY!
[3:00:10] <graemecrackers1> Bless us Satan
[3:00:11] <SilverInferno3> We'll kill you last ol' Red
[3:00:12] <+thesyndrome> Doom is teaching Woolie some great FPS skills
[3:00:14] <Rojahh> hit em with the masvidal
[3:00:14] <+DiabloDeAzul> @Hawkbone_ You've probably never been bored before.
[3:00:14] <Hawkbone_> Eternal is really shaping up to be one of the best FPS of all time. I mean, this game is already pretty high up there, so if Eternal is even better, woof.
[3:00:15] <@Solidus_113> fuel behind you
[3:00:19] <Lavrohas> what runes is he running rn
[3:00:26] <+BNPhone> 100%
[3:00:29] <%jepupu> You missed a perfectly good headshot
[3:00:30] <SilverInferno3> Real talk Doomguy for MK11
[3:00:32] <%GeneralSCPatton> I want him to use Heat Blast. The auto-charge is great.
[3:00:33] <BallerSwagBro9k> UH HO
[3:00:38] <resloxxx> uhh
[3:00:40] <DaBigVitus> is this endgame?
[3:00:40] <BallerSwagBro9k> Audio broken
[3:00:41] <neutral_guy> No game audio?
[3:00:44] <%Haarute> sound broke
[3:00:45] <Hawkbone_> @DiabloDeAzul Why don't you do watch an older LP if you have nothing else to do, instead of spewing salt and bad takes for no reason in Twitch chat.
[3:00:48] <+Estuko> I was gonna say, the dungeon gave me an Oblivion kinda feel
[3:00:48] <@Solidus_113> haste broke the audio for a second
[3:00:52] <BallerSwagBro9k> Audio partially broken
[3:00:53] <Brodius> Auto Charge is sick
[3:00:53] <dukenux> no sound guys
[3:00:54] <@Solidus_113> it's good
[3:01:02] <SilverInferno3> Still a Bethesda game guys
[3:01:03] <SonofMelonHead> Doomguy's footsteps are just really quiet.
[3:01:04] <dukenux> ohhh, im stupid
[3:01:13] <%Haarute> doom guy stealth mode
[3:01:20] <SonofMelonHead> Seriously, it sounds like he's wearing socks.
[3:01:26] <@Solidus_113> continue to rip
[3:01:30] <@Solidus_113> and tear
[3:01:37] <awalr> @Lavrohas rich get richer, saving throw and i forget the last
[3:01:39] <ghostspartan80> Doomguy is very light on his feet
[3:01:40] <Brodius> Let it Rip! Beyblade!
[3:01:45] <Lavrohas> @awalr coo
[3:01:56] <BlackermanZX> QUAD INFINITE

[3:02:11] <+DesertPenguin> You gotta get more armor my man
[3:02:11] <Brodius> HEAVYARMS CUSTOM
[3:02:26] <dukenux> Why would they leave him those powerups
[3:02:30] <niddron> yamero Woolie have pity
[3:02:30] <%gatorafan> Are they even TRYING to stop you?
[3:02:30] <+Nobrev> They're giving Woolie too much power
[3:02:32] <Charronia> Blowing a straight path to Satan
[3:02:36] <+DiabloDeAzul> @Hawkbone_ Look, if you wanted me to go away, all you had to do was ignore my piss take for what it was. And now I'm stuck replying why I felt D44M was underwhelming despite paying for it.
[3:02:37] <%gatorafan> It's like they are rolling the carpet
[3:02:38] <graemecrackers1> yes heavy arms!
[3:02:46] <Blackjackal95> @dukenux Because video game

[3:03:05] <+Estuko> that feel when you're trying the new human nuggets from your local Mcdonalds in hell and you hear shotgun sounds and heavy metal
[3:03:07] <@Squdnate> I wanna see if I made Moobot less of a beech

[3:03:29] <Hawkbone_> @DiabloDeAzul You know you could just...leave...right? You aren't forced to stay here, especially since you "defending" your shit take isn't gonna change anyones mind. Everyone is still gonna say its a shit take.
[3:03:32] <SilverInferno3> Good job Squd
[3:03:32] <+IncredibleMeh> lytMOTIVATED I haven't seen that glory before that shit was SICK

[3:05:11] <resloxxx> NO
[3:05:11] <%Aeoneth> You need a platform woolie. Double jump is too low
[3:05:13] <+thesyndrome> it didnt
[3:05:13] <Tucker0603> no
[3:05:13] <rcand9> it didnt
[3:05:13] <+BNPhone> get him below the ledge there
[3:05:14] <CoffeeSlice> it didn't
[3:05:14] <sunsetserenity1> Can you guys stop arguing, you're not going to change each other's minds. If you think his opinion is stupid just ignore it.
[3:05:15] <+Balkespower> No it not
[3:05:15] <BlackermanZX> it didnt
[3:05:16] <Vyneci> It didn't
[3:05:17] <rcand9> nope

[3:05:19] <%Solidnick18> NO
[3:05:20] <%Haarute> DIDN't
[3:05:21] <@Solidus_113> you have to be looking down
[3:05:22] <+Balkespower> you need to be higher
[3:05:28] <CoffeeSlice> sad!
[3:05:29] <%Aeoneth> You need a platform
[3:05:31] <@Solidus_113> it's camera perspective, not character height
[3:05:31] <siamzero94> Look also down
[3:05:35] <%Haarute> you need to look down
[3:05:36] <%Aeoneth> Barons are too big
[3:05:36] <%Solidnick18> wait
[3:05:37] <+Neoepochx> The other demons were shorter
[3:05:37] <+thackattack00> They're too tall to just jump above
[3:05:37] <awalr> double jump and look down
[3:05:39] <peachy996> They're too big for the double jump trick
[3:05:40] <+bubbli97> they big boys
[3:05:41] <+thesyndrome> he's too tall for you to jump above
[3:05:44] <+AJ_Cherenkov> They're too tall for just double

[3:05:58] <rcand9> you need to be literally on top of the boy
[3:05:58] <+kraajkase> They're too tall for double jump
[3:06:04] <+Neoepochx> There are a few more barons here iirc
[3:06:10] <@Solidus_113> Automap is later, despite being this room
[3:06:13] <+thesyndrome> look around, a secret opened up when you finished the fight
[3:06:24] <Brodius> Demon to tall to Double Jump
[3:06:26] <peachy996> This is very similar to the MKX Krypt
[3:06:28] <+gryffon95> its the otherside i think

[3:22:00] <@Solidus_113> The Praetor suit has built in surround sound
[3:22:03] <CoffeeSlice> YEYEYEYE
[3:22:05] <SilverInferno3> Woolz
[3:22:06] <%Solidnick18> PogChamp
[3:22:08] <+Balkespower> nice one
[3:22:11] <rcand9> phew
[3:22:12] <Hawkbone_> No, it was different
[3:22:13] <+BNPhone> thjat was different
[3:22:13] <+thesyndrome> not quite the same
[3:22:14] <SheefEatsBeef> slightly different
[3:22:14] <%Haarute> it wasn't
[3:22:16] <%DensityD> why did you climb that mountain? Because it was there.
[3:22:17] <Lavrohas> it was a different animation
[3:22:17] <+Neoepochx> Animation is slightly different
[3:22:19] <+Eddy21forsaken> different one
[3:22:20] <Tuna_Can_0> @mastermidget23 havent played in a while forgot gauss gun used the same ammo LUL
[3:22:20] <+TheDankDemon> on the floor
[3:22:21] <BlackermanZX> slightly different
[3:22:25] <mybigmeech> The demons clearly hold doomguy to some high regard though
[3:22:31] <+Neoepochx> He stabs the horn into the brain this time!
[3:22:37] <awalr> similar but yeah it doesn't look like a from above
[3:22:40] <peachy996> Oh definitely
[3:22:44] <+kelanth462> lever back in the puncer room
[3:22:48] <Hawkbone_> I love that the demons call the SSG Lucifers Bane.
[3:22:50] <Count_Long> Doomguys motto for hell is "Let them hate me, so long as they fear me.".
[3:22:50] <+kelanth462> pounder
[3:22:52] <mybigmeech> As in fearing him, as apposed to workshop
[3:22:55] <SilverInferno3> @DensityD Also it had a big gun on top of it
[3:23:02] <mybigmeech> *worship*
[3:23:16] <+BNPhone> demons just vibin
[3:23:18] <Count_Long> So, did he not notice the fleshwalls and skeletons?
[3:23:19] <%The_Timo> It's the Suburbs of Hell, where the demons live
[3:23:22] <SheefEatsBeef> it's literally just an alien world yeah
[3:23:22] <%Solidnick18> lore
[3:23:22] <%Haarute> it's outworld not netherrealm
[3:23:23] <%GeneralSCPatton> Maybe their souls were already eaten. It's not eternal at all.
[3:23:24] <Count_Long> seems like theres torture going on
[3:23:24] <akman14> Doomguy got isekaied
[3:23:24] <%DensityD> woolieLORE
[3:23:25] <@Solidus_113> woolieGASM woolieGASM woolieGASM woolieGASM

[3:23:30] <+SirGO0SE> FOR THE HORDE
[3:23:33] <%gatorafan> Kreygasm
[3:23:33] <+TheDankDemon> FeelsAmazingMan
[3:23:35] <ghostspartan80> they totally torture humans
[3:23:37] <khanlucas> lots of blood and bones, though
[3:23:37] <+Taglog7> It's not Agony
[3:23:37] <+tuchpi> noob cybot voice atpRtsd atpRtsd atpRtsd
[3:23:47] <ralphfromdk> Yeah, it's not Christian hell. "Hell" is just the name humans gave it because they didn't know what else to call it.
[3:23:52] <%Solidnick18> THE GREAT ONE
[3:23:55] <siamzero94> Yeah we saw what happened with him
[3:24:07] <Niney_Who> 1 Very Angry Man vs a 100 Ft Tall Demon
[3:24:11] <dekkitout> Doomguy literally went Attack on Ttian
[3:24:11] <@Solidus_113> that corpse at the beginning
[3:24:18] <+Taglog7> Okay, Dr. Claw
[3:24:22] <DeathByPoke7> You did kill the big thing
[3:24:24] <rcand9> titan was a bitch
[3:24:24] <mybigmeech> Didn't doomguy beat the town BEFORE he got the suit?
[3:24:30] <1matheuw> TITANS REALM
[3:24:31] <+kyh9> The DoomSlayer Slayer
[3:24:34] <+YabbaTroll> @mybigmeech ye
[3:24:35] <Hawkbone_> You are inside of its corpse right now
[3:24:35] <@Solidus_113> DoomSlayer did a shadow of the colossus
[3:24:35] <+Eightesu> Doom guy be like: This has been the biggest inconvenience how dare they
[3:24:39] <+therabbles> I DID THIS :) - Slayer
[3:24:41] <Tuna_Can_0> rip voice actor
[3:24:42] <graemecrackers1> Cyberdemon looks better in Doom 3
[3:24:43] <BoneofMalkav> Die Icon of Sin! You don't belong in this world!
[3:24:45] <pixel_river> totan got glory killed
[3:24:45] <BallerSwagBro9k> this is strolling down memory lane fot the Doom Slayer
[3:24:58] <peachy996> Ol' Moose Horns
[3:25:13] <+aceleapc> can't believe doom guy had a shadow of the colossus fight and we didn't get to do it
[3:25:22] <rcand9> titan was the skeleton
[3:25:35] <+Eightesu> doom guy only lets one demon live the demon that plays the trumpet playing doot doot doot
[3:25:37] <BallerSwagBro9k> @aceleapc Welp...we will in Eternal
[3:25:38] <SilverInferno3> Or blowing its head off
[3:25:42] <ralphfromdk> mybigmeech Nah, the suit was burried in another box next to his prison, so he had it with him the first time around. Keep in mind, this hell has traces of higher tech levels from which the humans have copied stuff from (like the gauss canon tech)
[3:25:56] <SilverInferno3> SHADOW PEOPLE!?
[3:25:57] <+TheDankDemon> why tho
[3:25:59] <RyanTheRecluse> Titan was the skeleton from before, cyberdemon is just some demon noble
[3:26:09] <mybigmeech> Oh that makes sense
[3:26:12] <sleepy_pixels> they should have just put a romote off switxch on it tbh
[3:26:23] <SilverInferno3> Ultimate Battle Demon oml
[3:26:26] <+YabbaTroll> BIOWEAPONRY
[3:26:27] <+Eightesu> im guessing the titan is the one on the box art that has lava spewing out over it
[3:26:33] <rcand9> cyber demons are so rad
[3:26:34] <dekkitout> "We were doing nerd shit- then shit got metal"
[3:26:35] <+YabbaTroll> DEMO-WEAPONRY
[3:26:42] <DeathByPoke7> Bio Freaks
[3:26:42] <Saltmeisterr> the ultimate BIOWEAPON
[3:26:49] <peachy996> I love Noob Saibot voice
[3:26:57] <gunsrlove> This is way different
[3:26:58] <@Solidus_113> Modulation
[3:26:59] <ghostspartan80> I love the voice
[3:27:00] <mybigmeech> You mean Dr Claw voice?
[3:27:09] <Tuna_Can_0> the voice doesnt sound pitch shifted but does make me feel bad for the VA
[3:27:11] <peachy996> There's a bit of bass to this voice
[3:27:18] <+sherndon226> This is a demon whispering what happened so the Doomslayer doesnt hear him
[3:27:18] <dekkitout> When it sounds like a Decepticon
[3:27:19] <Charronia> Cookie monster vocals
[3:27:21] <BallerSwagBro9k> ITS SICK
[3:27:23] <SilverInferno3> Here we go
[3:27:24] <Hawkbone_> Also its a disembodied voice, thats makes it better
[3:27:24] <%Haarute> COMPLETE
[3:27:26] <peachy996> Disagree
[3:27:28] <+therabbles> is that all ruins complete?
[3:27:29] <rcand9> close but far better
[3:27:30] <%Aeoneth> Dr. Claw
[3:27:33] <+therabbles> *rune
[3:27:40] <javis88h> Noob's voice is pretty try hard tbh
[3:27:42] <SilverInferno3> Nah he still gotta do saving throw at least
[3:27:44] <+Balkespower> KILL
[3:27:46] <+BNPhone> not even close reggie
[3:27:46] <peachy996> It was better than his voice in MKX
[3:27:48] <%GeneralSCPatton> I tried imitating that voice. Throat hurt for the rest of the night.
[3:27:50] <+rider_megalon> not as bad as the new Sonya voice
[3:27:53] <peachy996> Reggie now you are the hater
[3:27:53] <Dapper_Cactuar> Hasn't even Noob's voice actor made fun of the Noob voice?
[3:27:59] <rcand9> BERZERK

[3:39:10] <Ashenik1> @linSP is it the one with no saves?
[3:39:12] <BlackermanZX> what demon designed this place doodBait
[3:39:12] <gustavozxd> I thought it was supposed to be his children or something?

[3:39:18] <+BNPhone> woolie vs directions
[3:39:20] <Kalinflip> @mybigmeech They were letting us know early on that he is dead
[3:39:28] <+linSP> @ashenik1 permadeath
[3:39:30] <+thesyndrome> I watched an interview with john Romero, where he gushed about how cool the new Doom and Wolfenstein games were, then the interviewer asked about the new Keen mobile game and he just said "yeah...." then quickly moved on
[3:39:33] <Saltmeisterr> @averyoddjew what is it?
[3:39:36] <+hod_fareview> Don't think I didn't catch that T.I. reference

[3:40:31] <SilverInferno3> Doom Eternal on Switch should have a Luigi skin
[3:40:32] <+Nobrev> @saltmeisterr @averyoddjew it's only local coop but still hype
[3:40:39] <SheefEatsBeef> it is
[3:40:42] <awalr> more games should do the Hollow Knight thing where you can hold a button to bring up the map while walking around
[3:40:42] <%FuqBoiSlim> whole lotta red
[3:40:50] <rcand9> oooh
[3:40:55] <gustavozxd> coop in dmc3 PogChamp switch only atpRtsd
[3:40:58] <+BNPhone> outplayed
[3:41:00] <+RealThiele> hollow knights biggest flaw to me was the compass and map system
[3:41:17] <ghostspartan80> bugged direction mechanics
[3:41:33] <vincerocmm> locddoor open
[3:41:40] <+SirGO0SE> @RealThiele imo hollow knights biggest flaw bar none is the corpse run. its a game that wants you to explore with a mechanic that stunts exploration
[3:41:41] <Saltmeisterr> i like the map system but i understand why people hate it
[3:41:41] <+BNPhone> reeeeeeally wish dmc pc would get these features
[3:41:43] <rcand9> woolievs 3d maps
[3:41:45] <@Solidus_113> middle
[3:41:47] <Count_Long> yo whoever said he hadnt played this fuckin lied. Hes over here talking about bugs in second replays.
[3:41:51] <gustavozxd> the map system in hollow knight is the cause for one of my favorite moments I've ever experienced in videogames so eh
[3:41:58] <Kalinflip> dmc3 pc already has style switching as a mod
[3:42:07] <alrobot2014> @Count_Long he's talking about replaying levels
[3:42:10] <@Solidus_113> greeeeeeen
[3:42:10] <SilverInferno3> Woolie's invested in QA abilities, it's just a passive buff
[3:42:18] <Saltmeisterr> at least the got rid of the corpse run it silksong
[3:42:20] <+RealThiele> i get it, but the compass charm makes me :(
[3:42:20] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[3:42:49] <Tuna_Can_0> green portal to red
[3:42:50] <SilverInferno3> Full clear!
[3:42:50] <BlackermanZX> missed a log right at the end
[3:42:54] <%Solidnick18> SourPls
[3:42:54] <+PleasantLeech> to me hollow knights biggest flaw was having a dark souls death punishment but having precision platforming. If im going to be dealing with fast insta kills I shouldn't have to walk across the whole map to get back.
[3:42:55] <+CapraCreep> rip intel
[3:42:58] <+SirGO0SE> LUL

[3:43:28] <+RealThiele> well the platforming in hollow knight at least didnt kill you on falling, just set you back
[3:43:34] <Charronia> Enough barrels to be a walking Baneblade

[3:55:30] <dekkitout> Dude! Immortal Hulk is DOPE1
[3:55:38] <Tuna_Can_0> Immortal Hulk is pretty dope rn
[3:55:38] <rosabellamelantha> IMMORTAL HULK IS GREAT
[3:55:40] <+IncredibleMeh> ITS REALLY COOL THOUGH
[3:55:40] <BallerSwagBro9k> Marvel doesnt know when to stop
[3:55:42] <%GeneralSCPatton> Immortal Hulk is rad
[3:55:44] <SilverInferno3> HULK! *snap* BANNER! *snap*
[3:55:47] <+Masutasodo> Immortal hulk is actually really good
[3:55:48] <peachy996> Marvel is desperate for your attention
[3:55:50] <dekkitout> Read it, seriously it's good
[3:55:52] <peachy996> DC too
[3:55:53] <powerprotoman> woolie upset abotu cool shit, enws at eleven
[3:56:01] <honeyman18> Red Hulk was dope for a minute
[3:56:05] <+RealThiele> marvel is being sent to the Disney+ dimension
[3:56:13] <+tearfuldevil> banner! green! grey! red! banner!
[3:56:14] <+IncredibleMeh> hulkbannerbigmanjoebigmanproffessorhulkbannerdevilhulk
[3:56:14] <townzzzzz> mixing game cannon with comic cannon, WRONG
[3:56:15] <Count_Long> I grew up poor, so Olive Garden was super hype rich food to me, and I remember going to one with a bunch of other students in Military tech school, and this Fat Italian woman was bitching that it wasnt REAL italian, and I got heated, for real.
[3:56:16] <%GeneralSCPatton> THE ONE BELOW ALL
[3:56:22] <dekkitout> Reanimator, Woolie
[3:56:30] <+DesertPenguin> Is that what it's really doing right now?
[3:56:34] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @aceleapc
[3:56:35] <+paladinstarbuster> A LOT
[3:56:36] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1227284596695404550?s=19
[3:56:36] <powerprotoman> woolie you JUST PLAYED DOOM
[3:56:36] <$MateoPeso> Because shut up it's cool
[3:56:38] <SilverInferno3> Make magic cool by making it science. Make science cool by making it magic. The cycle persists
[3:56:39] <+CptnCampy61> Marvel comics...
[3:56:43] <peachy996> Comics are dumb Woolie
[3:56:52] <peachy996> Not every comic is Watchmen
[3:56:56] <%Prevot> when are comics NOT stupid?
[3:56:58] <$cherubs_anonymous> It's very stupid and bad, don't listen to them Woolie
[3:56:59] <$MateoPeso> Don't think about it
[3:56:59] <Jmann1892> What about the red hulk venom ghost rider fusion?
[3:57:01] <+RealThiele> Star Trek ispires science to make Star Trek which inspires science
[3:57:03] <+IncredibleMeh> It is very cool and Devil Hulk is an amazing character
[3:57:03] <whazat> hell powered hulk would be a good what-if
[3:57:04] <rcand9> let hell into your hulk heart
[3:57:06] <honeyman18> Hulk had a wife and kid die in his arms, I think they ran the gamut by now
[3:57:10] <ghostspartan80> comics are dumb what else is new
[3:57:10] <%jiggy_snipe> is this cool dumb tho?
[3:57:11] <SilverInferno3> SPIDERGOD
[3:57:15] <Tuna_Can_0> Immortal hulk run went more horror than anything tbh
[3:57:19] <$MateoPeso> Spidersman
[3:57:20] <Count_Long> Does Hell Hulk rip/tear?
[3:57:24] <%twilight_cleric> To be fair, it's def worth a read and still has the science vibe. It's like a horror movie Hulk
[3:57:29] <ghostspartan80> RADIOACTIVE SEMEN
[3:57:31] <%GeneralSCPatton> SPIDER TOTEM
[3:57:39] <dekkitout> Also, Eddie Brock's son is the Symbiote AntiChrist now...
[3:57:39] <+thesw1tch> that spiderthing is called a web
[3:57:40] <rcand9> hell hulk has huge guts
[3:57:42] <+Eightesu> its symbolic cant you see
[3:57:45] <Ipsenscastle> It's fucking dumb
[3:57:46] <Count_Long> Never Forget! He killed Mary Jane with his RADIOACTIVE SEMEN
[3:57:46] <BallerSwagBro9k> All superheto get umb eventually
[3:57:49] <zaitje> well comics are very goofy
[3:57:50] <DeathByPoke7> The church of spider men
[3:57:53] <BlackermanZX> Red Hulk... Venom.. Ghost Rider? doodWAT
[3:57:56] <awalr> gotta keep finding new things to cram into the comic
[3:58:06] <$MateoPeso> But if there are infinite realities then what's the matter
[3:58:15] <+linSP> dc 😔
[3:58:23] <dekkitout> Doom's mommy is still trapped in hell iirc
[3:58:24] <rcand9> same universe tho
[3:58:30] <rosabellamelantha> @WoolieVersus Hulk has had shit to do with the supernatural since the early days tho
[3:58:33] <vincerocmm> Woolie the lore slayer
[3:58:38] <pi_in_the_sci> At some point they just desided the spider-sense was magic
[3:58:42] <BallerSwagBro9k> Woolie is super right
[3:58:44] <+Deft_Thought> They did the same shit with Wolverine. All the feral mutants became a race that evolved parallel with humans. Their progenitor was a dude who looked like Wolverine with five claws.
[3:59:01] <+SlappyMeats> mish mash is nonsense, but give me Magitech and we're in business
[3:59:02] <Ipsenscastle> Editing is the most important part of storytelling, and 70 year runs of comics are the exact opposite of that
[3:59:04] <$cherubs_anonymous> Guys Woolie's point is that it doesn't fit tonally
[3:59:06] <gunsrlove> It's just adding too much
[3:59:07] <rcand9> yeah we get you
[3:59:07] <BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[3:59:07] <Shwepie> But the multiverse spider god chose Peter to be a hero!
[3:59:08] <$MateoPeso> Hulk is already dumb tho
[3:59:13] <SilverInferno3> Stark would START scientology
[3:59:13] <peachy996> What if Tony Stark was the Demons
[3:59:15] <Blackjackal95> that's Marvel comics for you
[3:59:23] <vincerocmm> tony stank
[3:59:24] <SilverInferno3> Or at least start a form of it
[3:59:24] <+aceleapc> @WoolieVersus there's no basis for hell energy turning him into a big green monster, but there is a basis for gamma radiation doing it
[3:59:32] <+tearfuldevil> yeah, science in comics is DUMBER than hell magic, if you know anything about science
[3:59:37] <+thesw1tch> @swish20xx doc green baby. hulk is smart when he wants to be
[3:59:38] <%l3sovikk> WOAH
[3:59:38] <dekkitout> Tony Stark's leading a robot uprising now or some shit-
[3:59:41] <rcand9> why no white panth... oh
[3:59:42] <%l3sovikk> Them's fighting words
[3:59:42] <SilverInferno3> FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT
[3:59:45] <%DatAsuna> He's right
[3:59:49] <+Caidezes> BFG Division is the best.
[3:59:50] <unit24> I would love to buy a comic that says "Tony Stark gets CLEAR" on the cover
[3:59:51] <BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[3:59:52] <Count_Long> BFG is the one that makes your skeleton scared because of the intense tearing
[3:59:53] <@Solidus_113> BFG>Rip>SkullHacker>Damnation
[3:59:54] <whazat> Skullhacker real shit

[3:59:57] <@Solidus_113> That's Damnation
[3:59:58] <Hawkbone_> LUL

[4:00:02] <grayphoenix564> Welcome to Hell
[4:00:03] <+BNPhone> bfg division best
[4:00:03] <%FuqBoiSlim> Hell on Mars???
[4:00:12] <giga_bit> loving the new acapella band
[4:00:12] <zv1neda> Vega core is better
[4:00:14] <laguerrilha> Damnation is really good
[4:00:15] <$MateoPeso> @thesw1tch Everything is dumb when you really think about it
[4:00:15] <ghostspartan80> welcome to hell?
