[0:15:37] <leith_aziz> Happy for Metroid fans (never played a Nintendo console)
[0:15:40] <andre11dr> It's very Strider looking
[0:15:42] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> I fucking went nanners when I saw that
[0:15:43] <+Arnoldoaad1> Dread was apparently canceled 3 times
[0:15:44] <leith_aziz> Seems like a cool game
[0:15:45] <DaKnightWarrior> So happy it's real!
[0:15:51] <%CaptainPileDriver> yeyeyeyeye
[0:15:55] <drunken_lemur> Oh, we've got the plug in still
[0:15:56] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> it looks SO GOOD
[0:15:58] <+mechslayer71> This game gets to exist but not Bayonetta 3 NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[0:16:02] <+OranHexthief> ntw animated emotes integrated in base twitch are3 a thing now itmejpDOGSLIDE
[0:16:03] <%wibbwobbler> Coool
[0:16:12] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @mechslayer71 THERE IS NO NEWS
[0:16:18] <leith_aziz> @mechslayer71 Dude, Metroid Prime 4 is still non-existent
[0:16:22] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @mechslayer71 what are you talking about? Bayo 3 was never announced Kappa
[0:16:34] <leith_aziz> We're still kinda stuck
[0:16:35] <picanoturna> dont care for prime 4 now that dread is a thing
[0:16:39] <+mechslayer71> Metroid prime 4 at least we know got restarted
[0:16:41] <Aydarkzero> can't wait for Dred :)
[0:16:45] <+TheotherKristian> Metroid
[0:16:46] <@Menitta> Seeing a trailer actually say METROID 5 is nuts
[0:16:47] <+hiswill98> Monkey Ball HYPE
[0:16:53] <+marumariball> dread honestly gets me more excited than prime 4
[0:16:55] <coreybom> @mechslayer71 By this point platinum is at fault in this one.
[0:16:56] <@Solidus_113> The new suit looks like the PED suit from Prime 3
[0:16:56] <leith_aziz> I feel that MP4 might get cancelled at some point
[0:17:01] <PleasantLeech> I always liked 2D Metroid better so i'm happy
[0:17:13] <leith_aziz> Same with Bayo 3. Eityher that or the game gets redone MAJOR
[0:17:13] <%Lion_kun> Now bring back Dino Crisis
[0:17:14] <+TheotherKristian> It's a damn shame that no other metroid game has outsold Metroid Prime 1
[0:17:18] <andre11dr> But you ,Not even Kazuya can fuck with Kirby, float the fuck out of that shit
[0:17:22] <%BallerSwagBro9k> KAZUYA CANNOT KILL KIRBY

[0:18:02] <%Necnill> He did it. He distilled it.
[0:18:03] <+mechslayer71> @coreybom naw dude, it’s totally Nintendo’s fault, they control everything. Platinum is totally blameless, as is Kamiya, who totally isn’t a toolbox and totally ISNT just messing with people at this point
[0:18:03] <perritoborracho420> one day will we have bayo 3
[0:18:04] <%cobalt_phoenix_> NO BUT IT'S NOT LIKE ME THO

[0:18:45] <leith_aziz> I never get rasism, at least not to the point of being hostile
[0:18:45] <@Solidus_113> Weren't the greeks super bisexual?
[0:18:48] <picanoturna> the homosexual underground???
[0:18:48] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:18:49] <linSP> Wait until homophobes find out they’re Homo sapiens
[0:18:51] <%livlinn> Well many Hungarians are backpedaling super hard… shiaCry
[0:18:52] <leith_aziz> Or seeing youself as better
[0:18:53] <Inqy833> But if we’re all homos, shouldn’t we all get along?
[0:18:56] <balthazar758> I think the Greeks were into it, but it was about who was on top
[0:19:03] <andre11dr> Also SMT V looking NICE, despite the questionable MC design LUL
[0:19:14] <Iwashi94> @Solidus_113 I remember reading something about how they considered true love to only exist between two men

[0:19:46] <mychael_bae> @livlinn what were they backpedaling from?
[0:19:56] <+mechslayer71> @lerouch_the_rebel Rome and Greece are two different things tho
[0:20:06] <%Seancicle> on topic Reggie ✌🏻
[0:20:07] <teflonbilly777> Jedi's say that fear is the path to the Dark Side. Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hate leads to suffering
[0:20:12] <leith_aziz> I wonder how Japan sees something like this?
[0:20:13] <Inqy833> @lerouch_the_rebel On the other hand, Emperor Hadrian was like the most gay bear dude ever.
[0:20:18] <+NoHopeForMyCuirass> Ditto FeelsBadMan
[0:20:18] <%livlinn> @mychael_bae The fact that diversity exists.
[0:20:19] <Iwashi94> my country literally just made everything lgbtq+ related 18+ :/
[0:20:21] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> Rome happened after, that's what matters @mechslayer71
[0:20:30] <picanoturna> fear progress and embrace the traditions of your forefathers because its safe and good
[0:20:36] <mychael_bae> oh yeah that......
[0:20:37] <T_Sasquatch> I WAS !
[0:20:41] <+AngriestAngryArtist> same
[0:20:43] <+mechslayer71> @lerouch_the_rebel they got snatched by Christianity tho
[0:20:44] <DaKnightWarrior> Glad you got out.
[0:20:46] <+mechslayer71> At the end
[0:20:47] <andre11dr> DARLINGTON IS THAT THE GAY GAME!
[0:20:50] <+Arnoldoaad1> My country passed gay marriage just this year
[0:20:50] <%BallerSwagBro9k> same
[0:20:52] <SomeAsianDood> Antinous was Hadrian's gay slave/lover and Hadrian made a monument to him
[0:20:54] <%livlinn> @iwashi94 Hello comrad shiaCry
[0:21:07] <+Katohearts> where is woolie in disco
[0:21:16] <leith_aziz> My religion might be against that perspective, but that doesnt mean I have to agree
[0:21:16] <+Katohearts> what am I jumping into here
[0:21:19] <+NoHopeForMyCuirass> @Katohearts Mid day 3 I think
[0:21:19] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @iwashi94 back in Greece, homoerotic love was considered true love, but that's a whole different kind of hate and misogyny lol
[0:21:20] <superchunk121> That's a lot of my family sadly
[0:21:24] <+mechslayer71> @katohearts just started day 3 I think
[0:21:24] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @SomeAsianDood naw man they were just good friends KappaPride
[0:21:26] <aiutare47> I think there’s a misunderstanding about Ancient Rome when it comes to homosexuality. It’s a lot more about ownership than love. Raping a slave is fine regardless of male or female, rather than love between men is fine.
[0:21:26] <Asuterisuku> Hey Woolie! I hope your back is feeling better.
[0:21:31] <%Mathochism> Mathochism subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! Glad to see you're back, Woolie. Back pain is total butts.
[0:21:32] <leith_aziz> Im honestly not sure how that religion perceives it
[0:21:33] <%TheAntitype> Antinous drowned in the Nile and Egyptians immediately deified him by identifying him with Osiris due to his manner of death. Hadrian is why the cult of Antinous became widespread.
[0:21:34] <+Katohearts> Mmm, thanks
[0:21:34] <andre11dr> @ketsuotaberu he just found out about the rape
[0:21:45] <andre11dr> Wait wrong
[0:21:47] <+AbnormalVoid> gotta overcome the RULES OF NATURE
[0:21:51] <+Sajallday> How are you feeling woolie?
[0:21:51] <zanzibarian_hamster> Nero had a castrated husband-wife, and was a husband-wife to another man, the man was woke as fuck
[0:21:53] <picanoturna> @katohearts day 3 hasnt talked to klaasje yet i think
[0:22:04] <andre11dr> The other dude with the K
[0:22:04] <%KetsuoTaberu> @andre11dr I was gonna say LUL
[0:22:12] <+Selectamo> what a time to tune in
[0:22:18] <Lieutenant_Joe> I wasn’t expecting to start my day with some pontificating on human nature, but I’m super down for it
[0:22:19] <T_Sasquatch> im more acceptting now but i still hold on to not accepting everything simply because people are like that
[0:22:22] <VJdarkworld> monkaS

[0:23:47] <%KetsuoTaberu> True
[0:23:48] <%doughvatkyn> yeah...
[0:23:48] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> guys, remember when the Candian government did a war crime?
[0:23:48] <+Reverend_Roscoe> yeah, that's a thing
[0:23:49] <Lieutenant_Joe> I forgot too…
[0:23:49] <krksobk> yeah that was pretty much the most fucked up news this year

[0:23:58] <kikaliq2> ohhhhhhhhhh
[0:23:58] <ingman112> Colonization is FUCKED
[0:23:59] <+hiswill98> Wait, what happened??
[0:23:59] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> Nobody noticed because they were native NotLikeThis
[0:23:59] <picanoturna> THIS IS THE HISTORY OF YOUR NATION
[0:24:04] <+mechslayer71> Natives, not Indians
[0:24:12] <Asuterisuku> Thanks MacDonald. Fuck you MacDonald.
[0:24:13] <+MugenSandan> yeah imagine getting beat as a kid for talking in your native language
[0:24:17] <justnathan18> Im not Canadian by any means and I’ve heard of this
[0:24:25] <notadeasterisk> it's still happening like in china with the minorities
[0:24:26] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Just some light genocide
[0:24:33] <ingman112> That's that Australian "steal the Aborigine children" shit
[0:24:35] <picanoturna> take children from their mothers and abuse them into christians
[0:24:35] <%krispen_wa> they're making the mother of all omelettes, Jack
[0:24:35] <boski_szumi> @mechslayer71 indians are offensive or what?

[0:24:44] <+NoHopeForMyCuirass> It's happening in American and Canada and Australia with the minorities too tbh
[0:24:44] <zanzibarian_hamster> Oh yeaaah, australia did that once too, they kidnapped a BUNCH of aboriganee kids and did that, they're called the stolen generation or something
[0:24:49] <krksobk> ^
[0:24:49] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Brakkar95 religion is a hell of a drug
[0:24:50] <Asuterisuku> @mechslayer71 It's offensive because they're not Indian.
[0:24:55] <Lieutenant_Joe> They actually prefer “American Indian” to “Native American” in American native circles because it differentiates them from Latin American natives
[0:24:57] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Cultural Genocide
[0:24:58] <iacus_> what are the flags?
[0:25:00] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @hiswill98 because the Canadian government wants to hide their crimes?
[0:25:04] <+vaporousTippler> Man, I'm glad the US never did that kind of thing, right? ...r-right?

[0:25:18] <+OhioNitsud> listened to a podcast about it and the history yesterday. I had no idea Canada did that

[0:28:23] <andre11dr> That seems like a lot
[0:28:23] <+mechslayer71> @boski_szumi what that other guy said, but also “United states of Americans” doesn’t really work, and no other country has the words America in its name to my knowledge
[0:28:23] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> Damn, Woolie's pooping off Kappa
[0:28:24] <Asuterisuku> Oof, 11
[0:28:26] <Brakkar95> Bro thats alot you sure you wont need surgery or anything?
[0:28:27] <Klefth> The whole pharmacy
[0:28:30] <boski_szumi> @abelincoln_catpuncher ye, but are ''native'' americans offended when you call them indians or is it some new trend in leftist politics, assuming they should be offended because white americans says so?
[0:28:30] <%wibbwobbler> <3
[0:28:40] <%Juriasu> playthrough is tarnished by Woolies rampant drug use
[0:28:42] <picanoturna> my man on that super soldier shit
[0:28:44] <Lieutenant_Joe> Woolie is a pez container now
[0:28:46] <+AbnormalVoid> peelz
[0:29:18] <leith_aziz> @abelincoln_catpuncher I mean, wasn't calling any natives "indians" a stereotype or something? Maybe thats why
[0:29:20] <Asuterisuku> Oh no the camera's flickering still.
[0:29:23] <$ArCielArDor> I just want to know Woolie's reaction to Kazuya trying to throw Kirby off a cliff
[0:29:43] <jorniev> GOOOD
[0:29:44] <aiutare47> @boski_szumi it’s generally a dick thing to do intentionally. Just use the right word.
[0:29:45] <+Reverend_Roscoe> loud
[0:29:45] <leith_aziz> Im on chapter 4 on Strive. My only worry is that Nago might become a jobber
[0:29:45] <dreamfillah> at last
[0:29:46] <andre11dr> That's kinda loud
[0:29:46] <%khalcipher> loud?

[0:29:54] <+ReallyBigRocks> ORGAN MUZAK
[0:29:55] <Asuterisuku> What a title screen though.
[0:29:57] <coreybom> @boski_szumi Dude thats always been a thing. Indians and Native Americans are different, and that use of it was cause the people that came to America mistook for India.
[0:29:57] <justnathan18> Let’s disco
[0:29:57] <miucsa51> oh the nooes
[0:30:01] <+cmdrmobium> Did the guys notice the title screen is a panorama of the map?
[0:30:07] <%khalcipher> @Asuterisuku yeah, so good
[0:30:09] <jorniev> the music is so good it ggave me memories
[0:30:10] <sushahana> is the menu music different?
[0:30:10] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @boski_szumi leftist politics? bruh I'd be mad too if someone from a society that genocided your society gave me a name I didn't agree identify with
[0:30:18] <DaKnightWarrior> Here we go.
[0:30:24] <%khalcipher> lets wait a little until we hear more
[0:30:27] <Kongro_> it sounds fine, it's just loud here i think
[0:30:27] <+Reverend_Roscoe> good
[0:30:41] <+ReallyBigRocks> Yeah I think that was just a loud part in the song
[0:30:44] <VJdarkworld> hashtag mr dubois for smash
[0:30:54] <+ReallyBigRocks> the climax if you will
[0:30:56] <andre11dr> Wow they STILL haven't done the karaoke, that's hilarious LUL
[0:30:58] <Josef_Stryker> Seems good
[0:31:01] <Asuterisuku> I love that we can see your skills and objectives at any time.
[0:31:01] <picanoturna> does it have twitch integration for mobile? my PC is busted..
[0:31:02] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @boski_szumi like go have a conversation with an actual indigenous American and ask their opinion instead of being a douchemuffin
[0:31:08] <Josef_Stryker> Hope you're doing alright Woolie.
[0:31:15] <jorniev> what would a sequel of this game be called?
[0:31:24] <teflonbilly777> @VJdarkworld His Smash attack is getting horribly drunk and singing karaoke at everybody
[0:31:27] <boski_szumi> @aiutare47 I dont think ''native'' is right word, they are different tribes with different culture I can call them Iowa or Pueblo, but not natives, its an academic word. U dont describe germans in Germany as natives, but as Germans
[0:31:28] <laserbeaming> did Woolie get a Cyborg Spine?
[0:31:29] <%Juriasu> the game is a bane
[0:31:38] <Lieutenant_Joe> Imma dip because I’m only on the third day in the game and I’m gonna go for a hike, but it was good seeing you’re okay, Woolie
[0:31:48] <+vtech325> This game is Woolie's rival stand.

[0:32:10] <sushahana> low endurance woolie LUL
[0:32:11] <%MrAtheGreat> @boski_szumi cmonBruh Yeah man let's just calling them indians cause we too stupid to know that there's a place called Inda that is literally on the opposite side of the globe.
[0:32:13] <andre11dr> They should probably unlock that door

[0:32:25] <zanzibarian_hamster> It's talking to the classy lady day today, right?
[0:32:28] <elshadow7> Remember to check which white checks are currently opened.
[0:32:43] <Asuterisuku> Is Harry Bi? I can see Harry being Bi.
[0:33:02] <aiutare47> @boski_szumi tribe name is fine if referring to a specific group, if you’re referring to the people who were native when colonists arrive use the term Native American as opposed to Indians. Super simple.
[0:33:02] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:33:06] <technodribble> Harry *feels* like a disaster bi.
[0:33:13] <boski_szumi> @MrAtheGreat well atleast im not stupid enough to call them natives, atleast I know the meaning and purpose of this word, better than you, and english is not my ''native'' language
[0:33:15] <picanoturna> harry is copsexual ppl
[0:33:25] <andre11dr> Well it's kinda spoilery but yeah he would be bi
[0:33:29] <mr_sups> Armor boots?
[0:33:30] <ingman112> You also wanna be careful maxing any of these out, b/c doing so means you'll get way less tries for that skill's future checks
[0:33:36] <Trace_Bovier> crossing bridge is fun
[0:33:37] <zanzibarian_hamster> @Asuterisuku He could arguably be anything, he could even be straight for all we know
[0:33:38] <+askalta> run the armor numbers
[0:33:41] <mychael_bae> general hobo
[0:33:43] <justnathan18> Fuck did he get rid of the Tie
[0:33:43] <andre11dr> Also that door
[0:33:44] <+mechslayer71> Oh boy this guy. No one calls them natives, they call them native Americans @boski_szumi
[0:33:47] <%khalcipher> no spoilers chat >:/
[0:33:50] <leith_aziz> @MrAtheGreat Dude, are you trying to make a point or something? Just don't call them Indians if they're not Indians
[0:34:03] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @mechslayer71 I know right lol
[0:34:09] <picanoturna> also homosexual underground touches on that subject
[0:34:10] <+physicslawyer> You stil have not done the favor for Joyce.
[0:34:12] <%cobalt_phoenix_> did they mention investigating the drugs?
[0:34:27] <picanoturna> yeah open the weasel door
[0:34:28] <laserbeaming> you can always look at your journal
[0:34:29] <abelincoln_catpuncher> check your tasks for a quick reminder if ya need woolz
[0:34:37] <coreybom> @boski_szumi The reason “native” is used is cause they are native to this land, i.e. native americans. We can of course use their proper tribe names, but native american is just used as a grouper to better identify them as a whole, like African-Americans or Asian-Americans.
[0:34:41] <Asuterisuku> I'm probably just going to listen while playing more GG.
[0:34:43] <boski_szumi> @mechslayer71 If no one calls them natives where this conversation came from, I think somebody said its offensive to call them indians instead of natives
[0:34:49] <laserbeaming> we still have to kill Cuno's dad
[0:35:15] <Johannen> You have a quick task you can do about a Pissing contest between Presinct with Kim
[0:35:18] <drunken_lemur> Uuno
[0:35:22] <picanoturna> so much to do on the 3rd day still
[0:35:23] <+ReallyBigRocks> kill Cuno's Dad
[0:35:26] <sushahana> seminine… NotLikeThis
[0:35:30] <teflonbilly777> I never actually met Cuno's dad. I stealthed around him completely
[0:35:30] <%Deft_Thought> "Sort out" Cuno's Father wooliePOYO
[0:35:32] <+cmdrmobium> Insane Clown Posse putting in WORK
[0:35:40] <%MrAtheGreat> Yeah it's always smart to look at the list whenerv you come back. There's a lot of stuff in this game
[0:35:42] <technodribble> We may learn about the traffic hooligan task today WOO
[0:35:48] <Miklosher> game audio is slightly too low?
[0:35:50] <boski_szumi> @coreybom well they are native just longer than european americans, but they also came from somewhere else, so not exactly
[0:35:50] <coreybom> Cuno’s dad needs to be dealt with.
[0:35:54] <nukle0nik> funny joke about Blackwater going through many many names
[0:36:03] <%Juriasu> yeah game audio could be turned up a tiny bit
[0:36:12] <teflonbilly777> @nukle0nik Remember when there was an official Blackwater FPS?
[0:36:19] <dreamfillah> game audio, yes
[0:36:25] <nukle0nik> @nukle0nik bad times
[0:36:31] <mychael_bae> @teflonbilly777 bruh what
[0:36:31] <+mechslayer71> @boski_szumi woolie used the word Indian for a bit, I said “Indian, not native” in the context of woolie being Canadian, so saying native would mean native Canadians/ indigenous peoples for him. I wasn’t sure about the proper term for native peoples of Canada so that why I said that. We know Native Americans works for the native people in the uNited states tho
[0:36:48] <mychael_bae> warcrime sim

[0:37:18] <boski_szumi> @coreybom if you just want use a word to better identify them as a whole, why not call it indians?
[0:37:18] <aiutare47> @mechslayer71 I believe the term is “First Nations” in Canada but I’m not 100% if it still is.

[1:00:04] <mychael_bae> the racism meta
[1:00:04] <+walternatorz> forget NASA, racism really advanced technological advancements.
[1:00:07] <nukle0nik> birth of a nation has some merits to it in terms of editing and shit.. but oh boy does it suck
[1:00:08] <%wibbwobbler> woolieDATTEBAYO
[1:00:08] <derap41> There are people that collect "Tar-babies "
[1:00:20] <%CappuccinoGuil> Ah yes, the thick plottens.
[1:00:25] <%doughvatkyn> it all connects!
[1:00:27] <therat_giant> thank you logic
[1:00:31] <dreamfillah> I've got a raging clue
[1:00:34] <drunken_lemur> @derap41 I'm sorry. What?
[1:00:35] <nukle0nik> well it was an easy check
[1:00:35] <picanoturna> the answer lies in the coast.
[1:00:42] <nukle0nik> ok inland, thanks a lot
[1:00:44] <ingman112> @picanoturna Shush
[1:00:47] <dinnydanny777> @mysteryfish_ And that's arguably not the most racist thing he's said or done
[1:00:49] <teflonbilly777> Logic's face kinda reminds me of the face behind the judge in the TVA on Loki
[1:00:56] <%MysteryFish_> @dinnydanny777 Sadly, true
[1:00:58] <shoonet> Rene is a monarchist, not a fascist
[1:01:01] <+eanscrale> Inland is right though, you should do this more oftern
[1:01:07] <picanoturna> @ingman112 i'm shutting up now
[1:01:10] <derap41> @derap41 Its southern heritage stuff Like Brair rabbit and huckleberry
[1:01:14] <SomeAsianDood> like take off the boots and wear them right @woolieversus
[1:01:14] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:01:18] <derap41> and its super racist
[1:01:26] <teflonbilly777> @shoonet Isn't Rene technically dark skinned too?
[1:01:31] <ingman112> @shoonet Largely a difference of semantics here to be fair
[1:01:34] <Timarkot> It is traditionalism not fascism
[1:01:38] <%derpy_platypus> you must live with the racist mug forever
[1:01:50] <+mechslayer71> Perception not high enough oh no
[1:01:50] <TheMagneticDragon> @Timarkot Uuuuuuhhhhh yeeeeeaaaahhhhh no
[1:01:51] <dukenux> the mug will remain there to mock you
[1:01:52] <derap41> Flashlights help with that
[1:01:53] <picanoturna> rené is that chappelle sketch then?
[1:01:55] <%khalcipher> Ptobably
[1:01:58] <%CappuccinoGuil> Watch it, the racist mug will change the ending
[1:01:59] <Timarkot> Kappa
[1:02:04] <mychael_bae> a light?
[1:02:10] <+Sir_Louis> Can always come back later
[1:02:11] <+askalta> theres a perception hat at the super cool thrift store
[1:02:13] <%hax_metatron> Woolie, that's a FANTASTIC guess, and yes you're missing a high perception check, but it doesn't matter down the road
[1:02:14] <derap41> flash light works in dark areas
[1:02:34] <ingman112> Just the nature of the build; you're never gonna get everything on a single playthrough
[1:02:52] <%cobalt_phoenix_> only if the area is super dark
[1:02:57] <Indigo_Automaton> It reveals things in dark corners
[1:02:57] <Miklosher> I think it rarely works in places that are clearly darks
[1:03:01] <picanoturna> only if you use the glitch which i think they patched
[1:03:02] <+Kataiser> The flashlight absolutely does uncover perception bubbles, but only in the dark.
[1:03:04] <Miklosher> dark*
[1:03:12] <ingman112> Generally the game will tell you to equip the flashlight
[1:03:21] <%MrAtheGreat> @WoolieVersus BTW Congrats on keeping content.  You can actually lock yourself out of this apartment if you wait too long.

[2:34:43] <ihavesillyknees> chat literally asked to save scum earlier
[2:34:48] <picanoturna> lol
[2:34:48] <extradopeness> you should ask her if she knows any good music for karaoke

[2:43:36] <miucsa51> Nooo

[2:43:36] <%Ensign_Epic> VOLITION'S COMPROMISED TOO
[2:43:38] <shincadad> Klaasje’s drama is off the charts
[2:43:38] <picanoturna> look at this fedora wearing fool
[2:43:38] <%kyh9> ITS WHAT KIM TALKED ABOUT
[2:43:39] <hassanico2> So it's not a total loss!
[2:43:42] <teflonbilly777> All blood escapes from the brain
[2:43:43] <aiutare47> its one of the coolest things in the game, building dependence on a mechanic then pulling out the rug
[2:43:47] <%Ensign_Epic> this freaking GAME
[2:43:48] <extradopeness> LUL
[2:43:51] <%Gruhunchously> Drama has been compromised

[2:44:15] <mr_sups> Volition is the BIGGEST Bro
[2:44:15] <%MrAtheGreat> This check alone makes Volition the best
[2:44:15] <+ReallyBigRocks> Turns out all the stats have their moment to shine
[2:44:17] <therustystream> Volition was my signature stat in my 1st playthrough
[2:44:17] <iacus_> would you trust a mfer who looks like Morgoth with the Iron Crown?
[2:44:18] <picanoturna> volition is the MAN
[2:44:21] <therustystream> no regrets lol
[2:44:26] <user_naim> Raw power of will
[2:44:27] <%cobalt_phoenix_> that's kinda reassuring

[2:45:39] <aiutare47> even after the callout logic is saying 'dont worry about it"
[2:45:41] <%Gruhunchously> Nah, nothing insidious
[2:45:44] <BurdRightsActivist> FUCK OFF MITSURU
[2:45:44] <Lefteron> She doesnt have a passport does she?
[2:45:47] <Ids560> Logic's VERY SURE that she's not insidious

[2:45:53] <iacus_> What's this about Karen?
[2:45:54] <%derpy_platypus> woolieDATTEBAYO woolieDATTEBAYO
[2:45:57] <DianaTheAscian> Its very obvious which lines have bias in them
[2:45:59] <romc215> She casts SIMPleton: when cast reduces the main character to a mindless simp rendering all buffs and skills usless
[2:45:59] <derap41> no logical leaps
[2:46:04] <teflonbilly777> Remember Mitsuru's catsuit in P4U!?
[2:46:05] <iacus_> Logic doesn't care about your ideologies
[2:46:11] <picanoturna> logic is playing it safe

[2:46:35] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @DonatelloJose lol

[2:52:07] <%Ensign_Epic> @ingman112 Compromised doesn't mean 100% wrong, Logic had a perfectly reasonable explanation, just was clearly biased in her favor. Volition decided to doubt it completely

[3:24:07] <iacus_> +1 to fuck scalpers
[3:24:10] <%orcstr16> The PS5 situation seems absurd at this point. Fuck scalpers.
[3:24:17] <romc215> @cobalt_phoenix_ Amen to that
[3:24:24] <+ReallyBigRocks> My new PC case doesn't even have room for a disk drive
[3:24:26] <derap41> hmm

[3:24:42] <zanzibarian_hamster> Do Scalpers even make that much money? You'd think supply would overwhelm demand even with scalpers at some point
[3:24:42] <Uselesswhitenoise> rachetand clank

[3:25:03] <%BallerSwagBro9k> WORDS THAT KILL
[3:25:04] <Jetsfantasy> They're cursing the chat
[3:25:04] <+wmeldrum> syllables are fun
[3:25:10] <Chatterbox1991> @WoolieVersus  Lombox is the name of Ratchet's race, in the new Ratchet you play as a girl lombox
[3:25:10] <AvroEltz> this stream straight up bussin
[3:25:11] <penitentpendant> I think this is more targetted at triggering chat than anything?
[3:25:14] <derap41> We know and it hurts
[3:25:18] <teflonbilly777> I blame the Spagos!
[3:25:18] <+whiskywolfe> I remember back in February Gene was on the podcast saying they might have PS5’s back in Canada in June, and we all went “Woah!”
[3:25:18] <zanzibarian_hamster> Haha you can't pronounce the made up word
[3:25:18] <%Ensign_Epic> Welp, he said the syllables. Someone clip it
[3:25:19] <romc215> @zanzibarian_hamster They always find a way, unfortunately, because there will always be someone desperate enough to pay their highway robbery prices
[3:25:21] <AnneSQF> Syllabuses are content

[3:25:41] <%SirGO0SE> speaking of what
[3:25:42] <derap41> jesus Woolz
[3:25:45] <null02255> Reggie described the plot of a horror movie that will come out in the next like... 10 years, where someone sends a Latin donation and the streamer summons Beelzebub
[3:25:51] <aiutare47> I tuned out and I just heard Woolie Madden say "Speaking of bussy"
[3:25:55] <linSP> did woolie just say bussy
[3:25:56] <penitentpendant> @CappuccinoGuil Chat's greatest archnemesis: Chat

[3:26:36] <%smyld> Woolie no
[3:26:36] <penitentpendant> @CappuccinoGuil The benefits of waiting for 'The Anime'
[3:26:38] <Jetsfantasy> Your deadpan reaction makes it so good
[3:26:39] <derap41> Youtube cannot find the bussy
[3:26:40] <+whiskywolfe> Brush that bussy
[3:26:40] <%Gruhunchously> It's pronounced 'bou-say' actually
[3:26:43] <Narbarec> Teach YouTube about Bussy
[3:26:44] <%CappuccinoGuil> It's a good point too YT being homophobic, I suppose LUL
[3:26:48] <balthazar758> the manga is more gory than the anime
[3:26:49] <teflonbilly777> It's all about the nussy now Woolie, haven't you read about the people getting off to COVID tests?
[3:26:51] <%p4ntless> is thrussy safe too

[3:27:25] <dds333a> @meniscate no
[3:27:27] <%Vigonept> whatever man hes poisoned to hell
[3:27:27] <teflonbilly777> Roy's portrait is like an even sadder Jake The Snake ROberts
[3:27:27] <aiutare47> @meniscate It was a grand day for degen twitter when that was shown
[3:27:29] <+whiskywolfe> It was probably nothing.
[3:27:42] <%CappuccinoGuil> @meniscate "are they a man? a woman? who cares, but they are hot, so that makes everyone gay." was my favorite reaction LUL
[3:27:43] <%Gruhunchously> It was just the wind
[3:27:52] <derap41> Roy gets this stuff
[3:27:55] <DevilHands_> The conception will soon take place
[3:27:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> Shack Shake
[3:27:59] <dds333a> @teflonbilly777 with even less facial hair
[3:28:17] <teflonbilly777> @dds333a I dunno, I think he has the same mustache
[3:28:17] <%Ensign_Epic> SMT MC is designed to make people realize that sexuality is a spectrum, and that everyone's a bit gay
[3:28:18] <nukle0nik> woolie's camera still blinking in and out of existence every now and then
[3:28:18] <derap41> meta physics with Uncle Roy
[3:28:19] <+xTJPBQdfNHA7qUxeTd5Uy9gV> nothing ever ends
[3:28:20] <Narbarec> Out doomered

[3:28:23] <%khalcipher> haha
[3:28:23] <laserbeaming> I love this nonsense conversation
[3:28:37] <derap41> Woolie gonna debate Roy
[3:28:40] <user_naim> Here comes Daredevil to Night Raid Vortex your roof
[3:28:45] <derap41> beat him with facts and logic
[3:28:49] <unthought> "Lieutenant, do you think reality is collapsing?"
[3:28:50] <teflonbilly777> Liquid can turn into a gas
[3:28:53] <linSP> A state of fux
[3:28:55] <%khalcipher> He's really high Wollz
[3:29:03] <+meniscate> a state of bussy
[3:29:03] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:29:04] <iacus_> technically it can also be a semi-stable state
[3:29:05] <%Gruhunchously> Beauty and harmony, governed by an eternal law - all the begins must end.
[3:29:06] <+Bitscreed> Oh wow, I'm getting flashbacks to chatting to the Hong Kong bartender in Deus Ex.
[3:29:08] <+mechslayer71> Imagine arguing with a dope head
[3:29:09] <DianaTheAscian> Woolie hes high
[3:29:13] <Arancet> depends on whats "ending"
[3:29:19] <DonatelloJose> states of consciousness LFG
[3:29:24] <teflonbilly777> Entropy will let dark prevail
[3:29:27] <aiutare47> Roy is indoctrinated
[3:29:31] <%khalcipher> Thats true
[3:29:32] <romc215> The guy who voices Roy also voices The Reptilian Brain
[3:29:35] <derap41> That's the best time to do it
[3:29:35] <%kyh9> Yes it does
[3:29:36] <user_naim> alright Vaati
[3:29:37] <Robot_Nixon_> NotLikeThis then whats 'inside' a black hole?
[3:29:37] <+ReallyBigRocks> The kind of high he is, is literally perfect for this discussion
[3:29:39] <%kyh9> It does mean you can't do that
[3:29:44] <%khalcipher> Its fun
[3:29:48] <%khalcipher> there are no stakes
[3:29:49] <Chatterbox1991> Is this The End from Snake Eater in his youth?
[3:29:52] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> it's very interesting
[3:29:52] <%derpy_platypus> unravel the universe
[3:29:54] <%kyh9> Because people who are tripping balls have no consistent ideas
[3:29:57] <+whiskywolfe> That’s just like a regular conversation with Minh.
[3:30:02] <%kyh9> About the world in which they're analyzing
[3:30:03] <%Gruhunchously> There's not stakes because no--one will remember it after it's over
[3:30:03] <Robot_Nixon_> NotLikeThis if space is expanding, what is it expanding into??
[3:30:07] <Chatterbox1991> OK Joe Rogan
[3:30:17] <nukle0nik> didnt you approach him because you wanted to sell things?
[3:30:17] <teflonbilly777> I've been there on acid and shrooms and it's a trip when you're in the moment, but silly when you look at it in retrospect

[3:34:55] <%MrAtheGreat> what are you smoking Roy?
[3:34:56] <user_naim> Mies Kuopiosta
[3:34:57] <%khalcipher> nah
[3:34:59] <%derpy_platypus> I am Hjelmdall
[3:35:02] <+EternalJedi> Pathfinder deity rules, sheer mass belief in a figure manifests them
[3:35:03] <penitentpendant> Conan Fanfics is go?
[3:35:04] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> American Gods style
[3:35:06] <BerryliciousDefinition> @null02255 god same
[3:35:09] <zanzibarian_hamster> Roy sounds like a good hang
[3:35:11] <derap41> I get it cultural effects reality
[3:35:13] <%Vigonept> he's hust high
[3:35:20] <Zomner> @user_naim Miäs Savost
[3:35:27] <%Gruhunchously> Fiction is Reality
[3:35:29] <jorniev> REAL fiction
[3:35:34] <+mechslayer71> Yep, this guy has important things to say :)
[3:35:36] <user_naim> @zomner yeah that’s the real one
[3:35:37] <derap41> just Imagine lotr not real but we all have seen real affects from it
[3:35:51] <drunken_lemur> Morale healed: At least you're not as crazy as Roy
[3:35:52] <extradopeness> nothing is real everything is permitted
[3:35:54] <derap41> Marvel isn't real but it has had a real effect on the world
[3:35:56] <iacus_> define "real"
[3:35:59] <dinnydanny777> Art imitates life
[3:36:04] <+ReallyBigRocks> One of the main things LSD does is cause your brain to make crazy connections between unrelated things
[3:36:04] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:36:11] <romc215> Roy has been through the looking glass, peered into the void and seen the truth of the fabric of reality.
[3:36:12] <dinnydanny777> Or in this case, being high imitates life I guess
[3:36:15] <%khalcipher> "It's dirt cheap"
[3:36:21] <+Bitscreed> Aurora Borealis!? At this time of year, at this time of day, in this part of the Insulinda, localized entirely within your pawn shop!?

[3:36:29] <romc215> @Bitscreed Yes
[3:36:31] <Zomner> WELCOME TO ESTALIA, GENTLEMEN
[3:36:32] <jorniev> BIG CHUNGUS existed for only .3 seconds and yet he is more popular than bugs bunny despite being bugs bunny himself
[3:36:33] <heemwizard> @Bitscreed Yes

[3:36:58] <romc215> @Bitscreed No
[3:37:03] <SonofMelonHead> @jorniev Only for now. Bugs will outlive it.
[3:37:04] <+Sebbers_and_Eggs> so by this games logic, wearing nothing would cause some people to take less seriously than, like, being shirtless
[3:37:05] <dinnydanny777> I'm getting too old for this shirt?
[3:37:10] <Crippl3> sick
[3:37:11] <heemwizard> just wear the patrol clock over the shirt
[3:37:12] <Indigo_Automaton> They should make this an actual shirt people can buy
[3:37:14] <nukle0nik> at least it isn't black with gold trim...
[3:37:17] <Chatterbox1991> looks like a Proadboy Shirt o.o
[3:37:18] <extradopeness> nothing is TRUE everything is permitted. thats the actual saying
[3:37:21] <+Sebbers_and_Eggs> er, wearing a dorky tee*
[3:37:21] <@Solidus_113> never too old for graphic tees
