[0:01:13] <%Solidnick18> i feel you
[0:01:15] <%tko552> I don’t do milk
[0:01:16] <lotharrio> Dry cereal isn't super weird. I did that for awhile in college.
[0:01:17] <Dragonborn983> some cereal is better without milk
[0:01:18] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[0:01:20] <vulkan_vibes> Not big on milk

[0:01:32] <notenoughgirls> i hate milk but i will admit cereal is improved by it
[0:01:33] <%DatAsuna> Speaking of cereal WHAT IS WITH MONTREAL DEVLOPED GAMES AND PUTTING CEREAL ALL OVER YOUR GAME?
[0:01:36] <%JeromeMci> What type of milk you all prefer? I'm on that oat kick
[0:01:36] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:01:37] <+gZombiex> I can't drink milk, so I never ate cereal with milk
[0:01:37] <Jmann1892> Is Cereal a Soup?

[0:01:55] <Redblood801> @Jmann9218 Asking the real questions
[0:01:57] <%MisterArcanine> Such a fascinating way to play and the game literally changes narrative because of it
[0:01:58] <+chiazam> you get your milk from a bag you weirdo
[0:01:58] <%JeromeMci> @Jmann9218 Only if you want it to be.
[0:01:59] <CrypticMochi> It’s way more normal than Paige’s soggy cereal love
[0:02:03] <NeakGX> I remember bringing a bag o cheerios to school at some point
[0:02:03] <Redblood801> PO'S MAD
[0:02:03] <RamenRiderZ> Putting cereal after milk is like filling the grave then ditching the corpse on it
[0:02:04] <%trustycoyote> Even the audio cops!

[0:05:39] <+SolidusRex> David Filoni is based
[0:05:42] <manwithaxe> ah, that was Sam Wither Mauls voice actor.
[0:05:50] <brachydios777> Filoni should be running Star Wars
[0:05:53] <%FuqBoiSlim> @optimasmaximas I havent played 7r but apparently the minigames are a bore there too?
[0:05:55] <kenny_biff> phantom menace still bad tho
[0:05:58] <vulkan_vibes> ooh
[0:06:02] <+doc_ock_rokc> Dave Filoni fucking loves dual of the fates he talks about it constantly
[0:06:04] <manwithaxe> sam Wither is great
[0:06:10] <%DatAsuna> obi wan the big racist
[0:06:14] <vulkan_vibes> thanks for the sparknotes on that article @woolieversus
[0:06:16] <Psyramics> "Dont need the money" Good one
[0:06:19] <%wunp_fxs> sounds prentencious
[0:06:19] <%ChoculaUltra> Imagine if Chris Avellone and Dave Filoni tag teamed on a Star Wars game?!
[0:06:34] <notenoughgirls> dave filoni's contributions are fantastic
[0:06:45] <zocano> Ya that’s a good clip
[0:06:56] <@Menitta> Huh. I never thought of it like that
[0:07:05] <%DatAsuna> You misunderstod
[0:07:12] <%DatAsuna> yeah obi and qui-gon
[0:07:28] <Redblood801> WE DO IT!
[0:07:28] <%jillpilled> Maul out there trying to clip children with his speeder LUL
[0:07:29] <Zathas> @WoolieVersus Those low pipes, you don't need to jump over. Just fly over the middle part.
[0:07:32] <vulkan_vibes> daddy maul makes dathomirian pancakes
[0:07:35] <%correctedsun117> Obi-Wan and Quan Shi
[0:07:39] <brachydios777> Kenobi and Jin
[0:07:46] <%DatAsuna> @ChoculaUltra That was basically JFO, avellone worked with filoni and other rebels writers
[0:07:46] <@Menitta> Though there's only that one line of "another useless life form"
[0:07:49] <%optimasmaximas> @FuqBoiSlim i liked them, they were pretty fun but hard as shit, which did ruin some enjoyment of them because they were really hard and required more hard effort which doesnt make it fun:p
[0:07:52] <Jaku2011> Just use FORCE SPEED OBI
[0:07:59] <brachydios777> IRONIC
[0:08:00] <%optimasmaximas> @FuqBoiSlim i liked the bike shit the best tho
[0:08:00] <+evbites> kai gon was cool
[0:08:14] <%optimasmaximas> HE MUST WIN
[0:08:16] <%ChoculaUltra> I have to ask now - is that ending scene of Solo with Maul like...canon?
[0:08:24] <%optimasmaximas> @ChoculaUltra yes
[0:08:29] <+jake5713> yeah
[0:08:29] <%krispen_wa> yeah it is
[0:08:32] <notenoughgirls> solo takes place way before rebels
[0:08:38] <%ChoculaUltra> I see
[0:08:38] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:08:40] <vulkan_vibes> Liam Neison has enough kids to worry about.
[0:08:43] <Jaku2011> @ChoculaUltra Yes but actually no
[0:08:44] <%CommanderSqueaks> So Qui-Gon HAD to die or else Anakin may have not become Vader?
[0:08:47] <Sapphire_Breeze> Sheev
[0:08:50] <+evbites> sheev
[0:08:52] <WhatzePh> Is this pod racing?
[0:08:55] <brachydios777> @choculaultra Yep, the villan of Solo is an easter egg in the final season of Clone Wars
[0:09:01] <@Menitta> Liam Neeson fails to protect a child figure.
[0:09:02] <%optimasmaximas> @ChoculaUltra maul comes back in clone wars and the u nderstanding of what tf happened in that scene and why he's involved in that shit comes from clone wars

[0:09:59] <@Menitta> If Anakin died in Episode 1, Episode 2 would be like Cold Pursuit
[0:10:02] <+evbites> Maul's whole character: I'LL KILL YOU!!!!
[0:10:11] <+doc_ock_rokc> @mankeyfigh That is what everyone calls it around me
[0:10:13] <+Taglog7> it's like poetry
[0:10:27] <%optimasmaximas> if anakin died we would never have gotten ahsoka, so im okay with it
[0:10:33] <Sapphire_Breeze> *cough* Mass Effect 3 indoctrination theory
[0:10:34] <+captain_history> Filoni basically turned Maul into an actual character.
[0:10:40] <%ChoculaUltra> Also - is Disney still doing that Obi-Wan series? Kinda stopped following the news on it.
[0:10:49] <+doc_ock_rokc> fail
[0:10:52] <@Menitta> Ngl I dont get the extreme love/hate for Ahsoka
[0:10:54] <notenoughgirls> maul's voice acting is fantastic in tcw and rebels

[0:11:04] <brachydios777> @choculaultra So far as I know they are still doing it
[0:11:05] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[0:11:16] <%CommanderSqueaks> God this music
[0:11:17] <zocano> Filoni is basically Lucas’ protege it should be noted
[0:11:20] <JetpackMcQuack> What if Star Wars were thought out PogChamp
[0:11:29] <%CommanderSqueaks> No, but do it tho
[0:11:29] <Sapphire_Breeze> bonus: streaming tax
[0:11:32] <%jaytitan96> Ashoka I think was suppose to not be likable at the start. We were suppose to like her as a charecter who grew as the show went
[0:11:39] <zocano> I believe the joke is that he is basically Lucas’ “padawan”
[0:11:48] <%ggbhtg> AND ALSO BE FUNNY AND REACT HARDER
[0:11:48] <+doc_ock_rokc> @GeneralSCPatton Anikan, how could you, you were like my son!
[0:11:50] <%jillpilled> yeah gawwwwd just concentrate your lobes on both at once 4Head
[0:11:54] <@Menitta> That is true, he did really go out of his way to train anakin
[0:11:57] <brachydios777> Again, Filoni should be running Star Wars
[0:12:06] <+evbites> i like how when you become a force ghost you get a dr.mahatten perspective and everything bleeds together
[0:12:17] <%optimasmaximas> @captain_history george's idea for maul was to bring him back in the show, basically george came up with the ideas and plots for the show, with filoni also contributing to them, and then filoni and his team would work out the main writing, which george was still involved in
[0:12:21] <Redblood801> The Jedi Council during the Clone Wars did a LOT of things wrong.
[0:12:46] <notenoughgirls> have you ever heard luke's original lines about her relationship with han written by george
[0:12:48] <%ggbhtg> you are the win
[0:12:53] <%ggbhtg> never lose
[0:12:58] <%ggbhtg> just like cards, etc
[0:12:59] <%optimasmaximas> they were also trying not to piss off the public cause the jedi were getting a lot of shit for being warmongers and shit
[0:13:02] <brachydios777> @redblood801 Windu did a bunch wrong
[0:13:05] <%jaytitan96> And I think Dave made the council wrong on purpose. Cause tbh the order was just as wrong as the sith

[0:14:10] <+captain_history> @optimasmaximas Yeah I know, but the writing and characterization for the show is what makes Maul great, and that was all Filoni's team. At first people even thought that bringing Maul's back was a BAD idea.
[0:14:18] <%GrassCannon> Is that a mother effing Spider Riders reference?
[0:14:19] <RamenRiderZ> "Oh no, I'm not brave enough for politics"

[0:14:33] <%masterpiecejeremy> This Character's model is the same as Griff's GF in KOTOR 1
[0:14:38] <DSD24> The Struggle is nothing short of divine

[0:17:07] <%optimasmaximas> @captain_history oh i know people thought it was bad, i grew up along with the show and heard all the speculation and was worried myself because i really liked the show and didnt know if it would result in the show getting canned from being "bad" or from hate. And i agree with you that the show is the reason maul is great, i was just saying it was george and filoni's doing, and even then filoni has numerous times adamantly said that the credit should go to george cause they're his ideas

[0:22:41] <%optimasmaximas> @captain_history eh, ive heard that forever, and im not saying it's wrong, but im not saying it's right either, i dont know the guy and was born in 2000, so the prequels came out when i was either in a ballsack, or in pre-k, so i cant speak on the conversations that sculpted opinions back then, i just know he had more people who didnt critique him, and that alot of people were responsible for the og trilogy's success; i won't say george isn't capable of forming an idea and executing upon it,

[0:23:03] <%optimasmaximas> @captain_history he just has a bad track record. and he was heavily involved with the writing for clone wars

[0:24:55] <+captain_history> @optimasmaximas Nobody is saying he can't execute his ideas, just that he does better when he has more than yes men around him. That's actually pretty common with big settings, you need more than one person to iron things out.
[0:25:00] <%RioGascar> Even tho god i feel like toys are getting less and less relevant

[0:31:57] <+oda_flobunaga> OBJECTION
[0:32:00] <%RioGascar> Or this gonna be grounded
[0:32:06] <Psyramics> That guy only has the one voice
[0:32:07] <ScreamLord> Pat and Woolie are a perfect example of friends that shit on each other ALL the time
[0:32:11] <Sapphire_Breeze> LUL
[0:32:15] <%StaceMcGate> the narrator and admiral in The Clone Wars
[0:32:20] <jorniev> is that nmorgan Freeman?
[0:32:26] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Why's this guy have a hard on for Ghent?
[0:32:28] <%0rri_Android> richter_the_d subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! Yo, Woolz, V. Good to see you're doing well in the health department. I haven't stopped going to work since the shenanigans began and most folks in the area are carrying on fairly normally. No real troubles. But I digress. Stay safe out there.
[0:32:46] <+eanscrale> dun dun DUUUN
[0:32:51] <JetpackMcQuack> Kangaroo court
[0:32:52] <+RioGascar> I dont think he has a hard on for ghent
[0:32:53] <lotharrio> No trial, he's still in holding. Also I get the feeling that there haven't been many "trials" for people, lately.
[0:32:53] <+doc_ock_rokc> @optimasmaximas he then calimed he didn't get a job for political reasons...not that he would likely get a job seeing that he has horrible stats now and is radioactive
[0:32:55] <+atin2000> @WoolieVersus you mean you didnt want another fish person court session?
[0:32:56] <+oda_flobunaga> Political implications...
[0:33:06] <%RioGascar> He just wants the case to be done
[0:33:14] <%RioGascar> And put in as little effort as possible
[0:33:14] <%optimasmaximas> @doc_ock_rokc wait what? what are we talking about? i was talking about george lucas with captain and i was talking about kneeling and flag symbolism with fuqboi, i dont know who you're referring to?
[0:33:18] <%RioGascar> And probably go get drunk

[0:33:25] <+doc_ock_rokc> oh
[0:33:29] <RamenRiderZ> "You seem mad that things didn't go your way, how interesting"
[0:33:30] <%RioGascar> The space mayor
[0:33:35] <+doc_ock_rokc> @optimasmaximas I thought you were talking about something else
[0:33:38] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> He was ordered not to investigate further
[0:33:40] <+prime_name> He looks like that guy from Hunt Down the Freeman
[0:33:40] <DSD24> I love public domain wind sound effects
[0:33:45] <+doc_ock_rokc> @optimasmaximas just ignore me

[0:37:11] <%Bluemanzee> "Oh and here's a lightsaber"
[0:37:11] <RamenRiderZ> A fine addition to my collection
[0:37:12] <%RioGascar> What is a doctor doing with a lightsaber
[0:37:18] <%0rri_Android> This guy had a lightsaber on him while he was arrested?
[0:37:24] <Redblood801> Why do all these people have lightsabers?
[0:37:27] <jorniev> why does this guy got a NY accent ?

[0:37:44] <+doc_ock_rokc> @optimasmaximas Nah, no real point, He is a guy looking for his next paycheck not a person trying to send a message. He only did what he did to piss people off.Even people who supported his message in the NFL think he poisioned the water
[0:37:48] <%BallerSwagBro9k> HMM
[0:37:54] <%Jetzord> @RioGascar He lost his scalpel and needed a quick replacement
[0:37:54] <lotharrio> So you're saying this doctor is a Sith.

[0:39:29] <%optimasmaximas> @doc_ock_rokc disagree, he had a point and wanted to highlight a real problem. he didn't do it to maliciously antagonize, and depedning on what you mean by poisoning the water and what the "water" is, i have an opinion on that as well

[0:42:13] <+doc_ock_rokc> @optimasmaximas He never cared. According to teammates he was just using it for money and fame because his career was going downhill and he likely won't get a good sponsor like nike otherwise.. His retoric caused even his supporters not to want to support him. Thus making them divided and thus they stayed silent

[1:36:11] <%Gruhunchously> Miranda is such an asshole in that conversation. She won't concede to Jack, no matter what
[1:36:15] <DSD24> Legion was the coolest

[2:01:22] <%tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus you should note that HK is not a relaible narrator? he's kind of murder crazy
[2:01:23] <mitochondriahousepower> A genocide on the side
[2:01:33] <vigilant00> @doc_ock_rokc Bonus round genocide

[2:02:16] <brachydios777> YES
[2:02:20] <%DatAsuna> but before the jedi civil war
[2:02:34] <ATPsoldat> Meanwhile, Malak was like "hur dur, im a bad guy"
[2:02:38] <%Gruhunchously> @WoolieVersus Hear me out, you can actually pick 1 and GAIN influence if you play it right. ANd you get some FASCINATING dialogue
[2:02:39] <%perfectsalami> She was also a very young padawan at that
[2:02:40] <+chiazam> ahsoka?
[2:02:42] <%JeromeMci> I like to think that Revan thought on multipule levels and saw the inevitable genoside as a tool. Making lemonade out of lemons sort of thing.

[2:04:19] <Redblood801> The Jedi's biggest weakness is their lack of change. They are the the most stubborn fucks in the galaxy and repeat the same mistakes every time

[2:05:28] <brachydios777> Padawans are literally child soilders during war times
[2:05:31] <%correctedsun117> Crazy overconfidence from the space wizards
[2:05:34] <%tearfuldevil> @shutupandjam3465 mroe accurately, jedi philosophy, as we see in the PT and post PT stuff, is deliberately a super lame one note interpretation of Taoist/Buddhist philosophy
[2:05:37] <%jaytitan96> Not just mandos
[2:05:38] <ATPsoldat> Imagine Atton as a Terminator basically.
[2:05:59] <+Freeborg1997> I remember a convo where Kreia says she hates droids, because she can't feel them in the force.

[2:07:16] <shutupandjam3465> @tearknack honestly thats best way ive ever heard it described. its simply a shallow interpretation of toaist buddhist philosophy
[2:07:18] <AlexStAdams> there are no Jedi in foxholes
[2:07:21] <%tearfuldevil> @perfectsalami if you're talking about swotor stuff, it should be noted that swotor isn't canon for kotor 2, its a retcon made by modern era (read as, shit knockoff) bioware
[2:07:22] <ATPsoldat> Atton: Droid breaks, yo
[2:07:25] <%Gruhunchously> @WoolieVersus You can gain influence if you pick 1 and follow it up

[2:08:08] <%gutlesscoward> Q
[2:08:08] <+doc_ock_rokc> 1

[2:08:25] <%Gruhunchously> @WoolieVersus It's the option where you say you can't let him stay on the ship if he's killed Jedi. It actually gains influence if you follow it up right.

[2:09:26] <%tearfuldevil> @shutupandjam3465 the jedi as depicted in the OT (Ben, Yoda, Luke) are cowboy/samurai monks in space, who have magic powers. in the PT, they kept the monk aesthetic, but removed any of the wisdom, cause narratively the jedi have to be idiots in the PT

[2:09:56] <+eanscrale> ehhhhh
[2:09:57] <%DatAsuna> @tearknack tl;dr people confuse 2 different events as 1 event then cry about retcons. Same as the people who think revan's mask is mandalore's mask. It's just a misunderstanding.
[2:09:57] <Redahoge10> “Might controls everything, and without-“

[2:10:23] <+oda_flobunaga> Minh, speed this bit up in the anime
[2:10:24] <%CommanderSqueaks> Woolie reads part of the conversation, blames chat. Almost like what happens when we only listen to the podcast and not the follow up when forming our opinions. :3
[2:10:25] <JetpackMcQuack> Chat doesn’t know shit

[2:11:44] <%eyezehuhh> red bar force powers
[2:11:49] <+chiazam> Does Woolie have too many saves?
[2:11:58] <ingman112> You gotta delete some of those older saves
[2:12:08] <+oda_flobunaga> Yeah, so if you could come in on the weekend and save your game, that would be great.
[2:12:28] <%DatAsuna> @tearknack I getcha, I'm just letting ya know that a lot of what others might tell you is based on a misunderstanding of what was said just due to wording.
[2:12:30] <Joostebrood> Revan Novel and TOR's characterization of Exile is very iffy
[2:12:42] <%DatAsuna> Agreed
[2:12:45] <shutupandjam3465> @tearknack and the idea of them being cowboy samurai space wizzards with a dash of real world eastern philosphy is so neat and original for a mainstream audiance its so sad it was debased in the PT. couldve been headier for an aging audience
[2:12:59] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[2:13:04] <%DatAsuna> the exile is the yakuza kaoru of star wars

[2:14:26] <brachydios777> Where’s the lie?
[2:14:27] <DSD24> Fear the PAK
[2:14:29] <%jiggy_snipe> well he's not entirely wrong
[2:14:29] <%tearfuldevil> @shutupandjam3465 probelm with that is that msot things don't age themselves with their audience. aside from MAYBE the adult fear of "my wife dying in childbirth", everything in the PT is aimed at either the exact same age group as the OT,cause its trying to create a new fanbase, not pelase the old one
[2:14:30] <+oda_flobunaga> Indigo Prophecy anyone?
[2:14:39] <%DatAsuna> @shutupandjam3465 one of my donations is specifcally about that and why it worked better for luke's order.

[2:14:59] <%tearfuldevil> @shutupandjam3465 TPM is arguably aimed at actual fucking children

[2:15:06] <megamirk> fuck that guy
[2:15:12] <megamirk> didn't even have a jaw
[2:15:15] <dereks0n> Malak wanted everyone dead to be fair
[2:15:16] <gandalfsmagicgaydick> Malak a punk bitch

[2:16:27] <mitochondriahousepower> You are already dead
[2:16:28] <%tearfuldevil> @shutupandjam3465 tbf, its not like OG SW didn't have "sell toys" comedic relief characters (C3PO), but JarJar (while kind of overhyped in badness) is jsut so much more juvenile
[2:16:28] <gruulmagebeast> jedi council playing checkers, Revan playing PAZAAK
[2:16:34] <dereks0n> She just didn't want you killed because you owed her money and she needed to fill those POCKETS
[2:16:35] <%Gruhunchously> 5d chess
[2:16:35] <%Ashenik1> Revan is the shit!
[2:16:38] <+lethallunacyx> Is this based on your actions of the previous game? or is this locked in part of the story?
[2:16:38] <shutupandjam3465> @tearknack the fucked up is that it 100% was. Star wars is wasted because its so valuable and expensive that risks are never really taken exceot for when its this game or something similar
[2:16:40] <tuesti> that's fucking SICK
[2:16:53] <+PhantomMiG> Also removing a powerful general
[2:17:01] <+doc_ock_rokc> Revan pre mindwipe is a fucking god of psychology
[2:17:01] <%Gruhunchously> You wouldn't get this dialogue if you don't do the goody twoshoes option
[2:17:01] <gluemanofficial> Future light side
[2:17:09] <snakemuho> @lethallunacyx it's events before the 1st game
[2:17:17] <%DatAsuna> You did the hiroshima
[2:17:22] <%DatAsuna> "Hi I used the nuke"
[2:17:24] <%tearfuldevil> @shutupandjam3465 because money, no major company is willing to actually age up a granchsie with its audience afaik, aside from like, elseworld stuff or niche projects.

[2:17:53] <megamirk> 2
[2:17:55] <%tearfuldevil> @shutupandjam3465 the closest i can think og is that the mroe recent digimon games are aimed at a late/teen adult audience? they
[2:17:55] <%Pillagius> And I appear! Are Hoe's mad yet?
[2:17:58] <brachydios777> What a hero
[2:18:02] <Jaku2011> @tearknack I hear Digimon has done a good job of aging up with its audience
[2:18:03] <megamirk> HK about to throw shade on jawless
[2:18:05] <Prevot> delayed illumination
[2:18:13] <%tearfuldevil> @Jaku2011 BEAT YOU TO IT, HAH
[2:18:24] <Jaku2011> @tearknack FUCK
[2:18:27] <%Gruhunchously> I did the bad thing
[2:18:28] <jorniev> so revan was basically the emperor of the old republic times
[2:18:30] <+PhantomMiG> @woolieversus Reven removed a powerful jedi that could oppose them and mess with the jedi instead of trying to kill a powerful general who would then face revean
[2:18:41] <+oda_flobunaga> 2
[2:18:46] <megamirk> 2 def
[2:18:50] <%tearfuldevil> @Jaku2011 its okay. not amazing, and the maisntream shows are arguably MORE childish than they used to be,f rom what i've seen. its only the games that have matured
[2:19:11] <%DatAsuna> @jorniev No but he was making a real good play to take over
[2:19:26] <Jaku2011> @tearknack Ok Cybersleuth is on my to do list cuz of the good things ive heard
[2:19:40] <%jiggy_snipe> well that leads into 2
[2:19:40] <+griffball13> becasue he iis a bitch
[2:19:43] <DSD24> Malak was a punk
[2:19:46] <%DatAsuna> I enjoy cybersleuth but do wish it was a bit less persona
[2:19:49] <%DatAsuna> Fuck an alek
[2:19:50] <Halospaz117> "I ain't serving the OG Meatbag"
[2:19:56] <%jiggy_snipe> Malak was a moron

[2:20:01] <+chiazam> MALAK WAS A BITCH FUCK EM - HK-47
[2:20:12] <Halospaz117> EVEN HK
[2:20:12] <+oda_flobunaga> Wow
[2:20:13] <%heartlesshealer> She accepted them, if it allowed her to fill those Pockets with EVEN MORE
[2:20:14] <brachydios777> Truth
[2:20:15] <Graxe_> Malak bombed Taris
[2:20:16] <shutupandjam3465> Im just happy this game exists. its one of the smartest and well written takes on a famous ip ive ever seen
[2:20:22] <gluemanofficial> That was efficient tho
[2:20:25] <+Vikingdeath1> lol yeah the Grenade Bar
[2:20:29] <megamirk> yup
[2:20:31] <shutupandjam3465> YES
[2:20:34] <%Gruhunchously> WHen HK thinks your going a bit far
[2:20:37] <shutupandjam3465> YES IT IS
[2:20:38] <%jaytitan96> Malik was dumb
[2:20:38] <notenoughgirls> YES
[2:20:40] <+oda_flobunaga> Reven programed HK to say that
[2:20:40] <%perfectsalami> HK likes finesse apparently. Which isnt all that consistent with how he acts but whatever.
[2:20:43] <prince_johnny_> YES
[2:20:43] <%tearfuldevil> IT IS
[2:20:53] <dereks0n> He gets shit on for that even in 1 though, doesn't he?
[2:20:55] <%Ashenik1> hmm
[2:20:55] <gruulmagebeast> this is a great oppurtunity for slaughter
[2:20:57] <shutupandjam3465> malik is really nothing
[2:21:00] <tuesti> So the council was scared because Revan proved that you don't need the force to be strong or that "We can strip you of the force and leave you a husk of what you once were"?
[2:21:07] <%Gruhunchously> Alek Squinquerguisimus
[2:21:13] <+Kirbachev> @oda_flobunaga I forgot about that, Revan actually programmed HK to annoy Malak LUL
[2:21:18] <QuestionableDes> OBSERVATION
[2:21:21] <+oda_flobunaga> yep
[2:21:22] <%tearfuldevil> @Jaku2011 cybersleuth is good, but its maturity gets a bit overstated, tbh. it is aimed at a late teen/adult audience, but its not AMAZING. it is infinitely better than, say, modern pokemon, but i wouldn't argue with people who call Cyber Sleuth a mediocre to average persona/SMT knockoff. Still, I enjoyed the game.
[2:21:33] <QuestionableDes> Water on the knee
[2:21:46] <QuestionableDes> OBSERVATION!
[2:21:50] <Naho_Saenoki> OBSERVATION!
[2:21:51] <+oda_flobunaga> Reven thought "meatbag" was funny
[2:21:59] <shutupandjam3465> FUCK

[2:22:04] <shutupandjam3465> CMON
[2:22:15] <DSD24> That's a lot of saves
[2:22:19] <GHouseduivel> You chose the name Fanny Pack?
[2:22:20] <gluemanofficial> When you can't even sweet talk a robot
[2:22:30] <%Javaa01> And if all else fails, try to stomp his dick
[2:22:32] <DSD24> Man Fann is looking more red by the game
[2:22:36] <Jaku2011> oof almost not sniffing farts anymore
[2:22:36] <+griffball13> damn
[2:22:37] <Naho_Saenoki> @GHouseduivel Because they're like tho opposite of pickets.
[2:22:37] <Redblood801> BOOOO
[2:22:39] <%heartlesshealer> dang
[2:22:45] <Naho_Saenoki> Pockets, even.
[2:22:51] <dorpork> it would've been easier to LOSE influence with hk, that way you can also unlock his influence checks
[2:22:51] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:22:53] <vulkan_vibes> influencing him all the way locked me out of max light side for the endgame
[2:22:54] <+doc_ock_rokc> @GHouseduivel yes its a joke because revan in kotor1 with woolie got the name Pockets

[2:23:22] <lotharrio> Granny can teach you some saber fighting techs.
[2:23:25] <shutupandjam3465> Has anyone realized how this game makes hk and t3 feel like theyre more than just 1 dimensional characters
[2:23:30] <olaksi> Lightside investment
[2:23:36] <%Gruhunchously> Do some good things and the balance will be back in life
[2:23:45] <Joostebrood> 'Stop me before I kill again, General'
[2:23:46] <snakemuho> @WoolieVersus you can get influence for HK if you force persuade a guard on Onderon

[2:30:11] <%jaytitan96> Atton's showing granny some shit
[2:30:20] <Zathas> I don't think he's necessarily closing himself off, it's just that as an alien it's harder to read their thoughts as a human. Kreia is a space racist, a spacist if you will.

[2:30:28] <Joostebrood> the use of indignities here is interesting here vis-à-vis the "i suffered indignities" earlier
[2:30:30] <ObsidianDragon86> Atton is doing the equivalent of SCREAMING in your mind to ward off Mind readers
[2:30:37] <Zathas> So she just assumes you can't read him.
[2:30:41] <megamirk> "anime titties, bit ol anime titties"

[2:39:29] <%correctedsun117> Smart boi
[2:39:43] <%Gruhunchously> The funny thing is, even if this conversation wasn't glitched, I don't think Kreia would give a shit if Visas was in earshot.

[2:49:58] <%RioGascar> it doesnt need to be anything fancy
[2:50:08] <Maleicus> I wonder if V will show woolie disciples inetractions at the end
[2:50:18] <%kyh9> He doesn't even deny it
[2:50:26] <megamirk> : <
[2:50:28] <%correctedsun117> LOOKS AT PLAYER
[2:50:31] <Halospaz117> He's looking at Woolie, not Fann
[2:50:38] <Maleicus> He has some interesting stuff

[2:50:59] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1260094696292048899
[2:51:07] <%ThePimpGuin> player isn't character
[2:51:11] <%DatAsuna> Theme of pazaak
[2:51:18] <+doc_ock_rokc> Cut to atton in the office camera room
[2:51:21] <%Gruhunchously> *Turns to camera*
[2:51:23] <%RioGascar> thats the 3rd time hes broken the 4th wall
[2:51:34] <%RioGascar> first time he mentions he was a last minute replacement
[2:51:54] <+SolidusRex> What was the second again?
[2:51:54] <dorpork> shouldn't the restored content mod have removed that developer comment?
[2:52:05] <%Gruhunchously> Atton can see through the fourth wall
[2:52:11] <%RioGascar> i don’t remember but it was on nar shada
[2:52:12] <%DatAsuna> "I guess we really are the knights of the old republic too"
[2:52:14] <dorpork> like that's obviously meant for voice acting instruction. why did the mod leave that in?
[2:52:20] <+doc_ock_rokc> Atton has been COUNTING CARDS IN HIS HEAD
[2:52:31] <damienlunas> 19
[2:52:33] <%DatAsuna> @dorpork it's not from the mod
[2:52:42] <shincadad> PURE PAZAAK
[2:52:48] <%subjectg> Each player has a separate deck, 60 cards each
[2:52:57] <Redblood801> PURE PAZAAK
[2:53:26] <dorpork> @DatAsuna I know it's not from the mod. I'm saying the mod should have removed that 'frowns at player' line since it's clearly a bug
[2:53:39] <zocano> This is the paranoia you develop when you are just surrounded by jedi every hour of every day
[2:53:43] <%kyh9> He plays it as mental white noise to jam your mind-reading
[2:53:45] <%jiggy_snipe> GET OUT OF MY MIND CHARLES
[2:53:57] <%Gruhunchously> Tell him
[2:54:07] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YUGIOH
[2:54:07] <megamirk> get ready to d-d-d-duel, Fann
[2:54:11] <%ChoculaUltra> that's deep.
[2:54:15] <+griffball13> come and get your game on
[2:54:16] <Camail> if you think about shielding your thoughts then you already lost
[2:54:18] <silver__viii> I fuckin love Atton
[2:54:19] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @megamirk Aaaaaayyy
[2:54:19] <+SolidusRex> This scene is slightly romantically skewed if you're playing a female
[2:54:21] <lotharrio> The student is the teacher.
[2:54:22] <snakemuho> PAZAAK EVERYWHERE SYSTEM
[2:54:36] <%heartlesshealer> brains hate numbers
[2:54:49] <brachydios777> Big brain strats
[2:54:51] <Camail> she's just really really good
[2:54:54] <silver__viii> IT didn't work on Kreia because she caught him off guard I believe
[2:54:54] <Jaku2011> But Kreia is pretty top tier mind reading
[2:54:55] <+Kirbachev> Kreia is just that damned good, and she still had to push through.
[2:54:56] <%gatorafan> PURE PAZAAK
[2:54:58] <+doc_ock_rokc> Kreia started figuring it out by over exposure
[2:55:00] <zocano> Kreia's powerful enough to force break it
[2:55:01] <%ThePimpGuin> it did work, she literally had to force her way in super serious like
[2:55:01] <+grim_alex95> Just imagine some weird porn and you’re fine LUL
[2:55:03] <Redblood801> He said it makes it harder, it's not invincible
[2:55:03] <+MillerLowlife> but she still cant read him
[2:55:04] <sonicblade38> not full proof
[2:55:04] <%StaceMcGate> Pazaak is now a canon state
[2:55:04] <Doodle_Taco> Kreia is a pro on the mind shit
[2:55:08] <+MillerLowlife> even though she knows
[2:55:12] <+Ancopro> it makes it harder, not impossible
[2:55:18] <%jiggy_snipe> thinking about Pazaak in a cell is weird so she got it
[2:55:21] <gruulmagebeast> pure y'pakk
[2:55:21] <shincadad> !uptime
[2:55:22] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 55 minutes
[2:55:22] <%DatAsuna> play teppen in your head
[2:55:28] <%heartlesshealer> garbage buffer
[2:55:29] <olaksi> Mind pop-ups
[2:55:29] <%Irridium> fill up your mind with phat tiddies
[2:55:30] <%CursedNobleman> SwiftRage Real couriers play caravan in their head LUL
[2:55:30] <megamirk> go over your exhentai gallery in your head
[2:55:31] <%Gruhunchously> He let his guard down for a moment and Kreia seized upon it
[2:55:32] <%RioGascar> for a lesser jedi it would fail but kreai is anything but
[2:55:35] <+eanscrale> She opened him up with a mental command grab
[2:55:36] <KaitlynnHere> keria searched his mind further because atton was talking shit about jedi and she was like "...waaaiit"
[2:55:45] <+griffball13> think about the big titties
[2:55:47] <+Buzzkill983> Shes like, wait, why are you thinking about pazaak still?
[2:55:47] <Tucker0603> ADHD POWERS!!!
[2:55:48] <lotharrio> One of the cooler things that has happened in Marvel lately, is that gamma mutates have a natural defense against telepaths. They aren't immune to mind reading, but they can mentally lash out at people who are trying to read them.
[2:55:51] <%StaceMcGate> MIRA TIME
[2:55:52] <%ThePimpGuin> Play DMC in your head Woolie to resist the force! "all these thoughts running through my head~"
[2:55:57] <Camail> +2 on hit, counter hit its +5
[2:56:02] <Jaku2011> ENTER THE MIRA HOLE
[2:56:02] <+chiazam> What item did you lose???
[2:56:02] <gruulmagebeast> playing a magic the gathering storm deck in your head
[2:56:03] <ingman112> Couple things you can get: talk to T3 about mandalore and the droid warehouse
[2:56:06] <+Ancopro> list mvc comboes in your head
[2:56:11] <%jiggy_snipe> LUL
[2:56:12] <%heartlesshealer> Anything with T3?
[2:56:12] <Camail> SIKE
[2:56:16] <+CptnCampy61> The story concepts in this are great
[2:56:17] <Camail> stabby stabby
[2:56:17] <%Gruhunchously> Ah, you
[2:56:24] <Doodle_Taco> @woolieversus Kreia found Atton's thoughts and had the same reaction as you finding bugs LUL
[2:56:28] <+mrcooperblack> give the jedi an auctioneer routine
[2:56:28] <KaitlynnHere> Pazaak and titties
[2:56:29] <%OldManDeckardCain> brazilian kens would be super hard to read LUL
[2:56:30] <+doc_ock_rokc> The shape of the nose could be broken into 3 shapes with the lighting coming from the front right angle
[2:56:36] <+Estuko> think about Visas enormous che st
[2:56:36] <%jinking79> think bout VF 7
[2:56:36] <%RioGascar> I can probably use playing resident evil 2 or dead rising to play in my head
[2:56:37] <snakemuho> if I put the video on 2x speed then it would go faster but then the speech would be harder to understand, so I could put it at 1.5x but then it would be a bit slow
[2:56:37] <Augus7717> LUL

[2:56:43] <KaitlynnHere> who knew that would be the biggest defense against jedi
[2:56:44] <%StaceMcGate> YOU CAN'T ESCAPE
[2:56:47] <damienlunas> I wish instead of teaching you to play Pazaak he teaches you how to defeat Jedi by thinking of horny
[2:56:48] <%RioGascar> or i can play into the breach in my head
[2:56:48] <%jiggy_snipe> talk to T3
[2:56:48] <%HostilePoundcakes> LUL
[2:56:49] <%Malik1002> WHO

[2:56:58] <jorniev> what if it's an fgc jedi
[2:57:00] <%Malik1002> T3 Yeah he a good talk
[2:57:09] <+mrcooperblack> Imagine being a jedi using mind jack to figure out who wants to harm you and you come across some dude who you can't understand because they're thinking so fast
[2:57:11] <%ThePimpGuin> random drop do you know Mandalor?
[2:57:21] <%DatAsuna> who lives on drury lane?
[2:57:27] <+evbites> t3: you can't handle the truth
[2:57:29] <megamirk> cmonBruh
[2:57:30] <KaitlynnHere> @damienlunas i can't teach you how to block jedi with horny, but i can teach you about porn
[2:57:32] <Fixer997> Considering the fuckfest that was the last podcast episode, it's good to see Woolie happy while playing Kotor
[2:57:41] <gruulmagebeast> Candolore
[2:57:44] <%correctedsun117> He fell in a well!?
[2:57:50] <snakemuho> oh shit wait what

[2:58:46] <KaitlynnHere> switch it off! i cant bare watching them stand around!
[2:58:50] <dorpork> treat injury makes sense, you can judge the wound
[2:58:52] <%DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus IIRC this just lets you ask cando directly
[2:58:52] <socratetris> Quick, Universe! Makes noises to replace the missing audio!
[2:58:54] <Halospaz117> Well, Treat Injury would allow you to recognize the severity of the wounds
[2:59:04] <shutupandjam3465> aw man i missed out on the atton stuff
[2:59:10] <%DatAsuna> But I'm a maybe on that one

[2:59:43] <lotharrio> Goto questions.
[2:59:48] <Augus7717> ask about goto @WoolieVersus
[2:59:49] <dereks0n> You could've said what he was doing
[2:59:53] <DSD24> Revan was badass
[2:59:53] <Halospaz117> Pockets discoverd nhentai
[2:59:55] <Jaku2011> Revans favorite tag
[2:59:55] <gruulmagebeast> cause im about to break
[2:59:59] <RantingRavager> FemRevan: Mindbreak Queen
[3:00:00] <+atin2000> The worst part is, *none* of this is cannon
[3:00:01] <Camail> its a family thing
[3:00:03] <dorpork> 2
[3:00:07] <%ChoculaUltra> what more can you want? "Dee - Deet" was pretty definitive.
[3:00:09] <%heartlesshealer> Goto
[3:00:10] <megamirk> could've been worse, could've been netorare
[3:00:11] <+doc_ock_rokc> She has a Specific fetish
[3:00:13] <Camail> wake up, break a mind, eat breakfast, break a mind
[3:00:13] <Doodle_Taco> She learned feom her master it seems
[3:00:13] <+chiazam> TAG - MIND bREAK
[3:00:14] <%heartlesshealer> woolie
[3:00:15] <snakemuho> @atin2000 shut up, canon isn't canon
[3:00:16] <%ThePimpGuin> "was trying to" tho, meaning Pockets ultimately failed but let him live
[3:00:16] <Camail> its just what we do
[3:00:22] <%heartlesshealer> 'kay bye T3
[3:00:22] <Prevot> Revan was the one drawing all those Hypno doujins
[3:00:26] <zocano> darkside Revan is so much more interesting
[3:00:26] <Augus7717> ask T3 about Goto
[3:00:32] <%RioGascar> i saw that mouse cursor
[3:00:37] <zocano> for how Revan plays out in KOTOR2
[3:00:40] <ATPsoldat> Light Side Revan still mind breaks If I remember right?
[3:00:43] <%correctedsun117> What?
[3:00:52] <+Kirbachev> At the end of KOTOR1, Revan essentially breaks Malak in dialogue right before killing him off once and for all. Mindfuckery - without even using the Jedi Mindtrick - is very much his thing.
[3:00:56] <+atin2000> @SnaKemuho I just mean the old cannon
[3:00:57] <%RioGascar> Jedi just mind break in general
[3:01:00] <GHouseduivel> @ATPsoldat Dark Side Revan is cannon
[3:01:02] <%correctedsun117> Wouldn't the Sith be down for Mandos?
[3:01:08] <lotharrio> @ATPsoldat No, Light Side Revan had friends
[3:01:08] <RantingRavager> This is the Way
[3:01:21] <Dehlome> oh ok we can go to cool mando room now
[3:01:21] <akman14> B-baka

[3:07:39] <solidgoldtoast> DARKSIDE WOOLIE
[3:07:48] <+Kirbachev> Mira's alright, but she's pretty much a grown-up Scout, except with an angry wookie instead of a nice one.
[3:07:55] <damienlunas> cmonBruh
[3:07:56] <shincadad> A Wookiee should have been standing there :(
[3:07:57] <%BallerSwagBro9k> WOW
[3:07:59] <teamzackattack> kasheeek
[3:07:59] <megamirk> cmonBruh
[3:07:59] <+Kirbachev> Not much else going on with her character.

[3:08:17] <+jake5713> But Kashyshyyk isn't in the outer rim.
[3:08:18] <Halospaz117> Pretty sure Wookies are relatively new to the galaxy
[3:08:24] <solidgoldtoast> Mira would get along with Wakka
[3:08:24] <Doodle_Taco> Why do people defend her?
[3:08:28] <%phatmac16> Just like Ashley
[3:08:28] <%StaceMcGate> Wookies are from a backwater planet
[3:08:30] <ralphfromdk> It's like a white person that has never seen a black person, not even on pictures
[3:08:32] <%JeromeMci> The galaxys a large place
[3:08:32] <silver__viii> Wait how does she know what language he speaks when it's exclusive to Wookies
[3:08:35] <DSD24> Those thugs lied as naturally as they breathed
[3:08:35] <Zathas> Wookies are still a backwater planet race at this point in time.
[3:08:35] <%tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus Wookies are new
[3:08:35] <%Ashenik1> I love how V said: You uncultured fuck!
[3:08:36] <%TheFabledAble> Luke didnt know what a wookie was eityher
[3:08:37] <Jaku2011> I mean you don't see too many wookies right?
[3:08:38] <%DatAsuna> REVOKE HER W-PASS
[3:08:40] <%Pillagius> And she's supposed to be best bounty hunter
[3:08:41] <%phatmac16> Woolies are a new race
[3:08:43] <$xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> She is the main reason I can't do light side in KOTOR 2
[3:08:43] <%Gruhunchously> Because she lived on Nar Shadaa on her entire life?
[3:08:45] <DXLelouch24> is Mira the Ashely of KOTOR2?
[3:08:46] <solidgoldtoast> Are Wookies good at Blitzball though???
[3:08:48] <KiddKame> How Does this bitch NOT know what a Wookiee is
[3:08:53] <+oda_flobunaga> @WoolieVersus wHAT RACE IS YODA HUH?
[3:08:55] <+Zyquux> At this point most people would only see Wookies in the context of slaves.
[3:08:57] <%correctedsun117> Fluent in his language, doesn't know his race, what?
[3:08:57] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> I feel like shes lieing. She cant be this ignorant
[3:08:59] <%DatAsuna> @DXLelouch24 she's not agressively bitchy enough
[3:08:59] <ATPsoldat> Bounty Hunter travels around the galaxy...and not know a wookie?
[3:08:59] <dorpork> her not knowing Wookies makes perfect sense. Just beause all the movies and games all focus on wookies, doesn't mean the entire star wars universe is equally obsessed with them
[3:09:01] <asurite_warrior> I mean there are like 100 different races.
[3:09:01] <%jiggy_snipe> LUL
[3:09:02] <Zathas> Czerka were literally enslaving them with no issue just a few years ago, because they literally had no rights.
[3:09:08] <arkv01> @Imsoverylazy they're too good at blitzball and wakka wants to wipe them out
[3:09:13] <%Irridium> normally I'd say it's because the galaxy is big and people could just not know about other planets/races but Star Wars is the smallest fucking galaxy ever with everything taking place on like the same 7 planets
[3:09:14] <%RioGascar> I can be semi fair and say that you may not know every single race in the world
[3:09:14] <+anokokujin> !uptime
[3:09:14] <+yaroslev_tartakovsky> Wookies seem to be a pretty obscure race outside of "reference to chewbacca"
[3:09:16] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 9 minutes
[3:09:18] <dead_harmony13> Have you heard of the high elves?
[3:09:20] <Halospaz117> Yeah that sounds specific
[3:09:20] <Klefth> @oda_flobunaga He's, uh... Merchandise
[3:09:20] <lotharrio> "Huh, what a weird Bothan."
[3:09:21] <%CursedNobleman> the blue fox species LUL
[3:09:25] <%jiggy_snipe> good point, what race is Yoda?
[3:09:26] <%tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus wookies aren't listed dudes
[3:09:35] <%Ashenik1> Woolie do you know every ethinc background
[3:09:38] <Jaku2011> What's Yoda again?
[3:09:39] <%Bluemanzee> What race is Yoda?
[3:09:39] <asurite_warrior> Do you know all the different tribes in pakistan
[3:09:41] <silver__viii> @dorpork no me hate mira SMOrc
[3:09:42] <TheAlienatorJM> woolie!!!!
[3:09:42] <%phatmac16> Wookies aren’t listed and are unknown to the galaxy
[3:09:43] <damienlunas> How many wookie extras did you see in the movies?
[3:09:46] <ATPsoldat> there are many furry species thou
[3:09:48] <Doodle_Taco> Wait...how can she speak their language without knowing what they are?
[3:09:49] <Zathas> Also, Wookies are super insular. It's actually incredibly weird for someone to even meet one. Let alone two.
[3:09:49] <DSD24> @jiggy_snipe Yoda's Race is Yoda's Race
[3:09:52] <+Ancopro> GREEN
[3:09:53] <%Malik1002> YODA IS DIFFERENT
[3:09:55] <%tearfuldevil> i don't like Mira, but this is a lame take
[3:09:57] <Sedrelic> Yodacians
[3:09:59] <ashenjuan25> Further reasons why Mira sucks
[3:10:03] <ashenjuan25> Space racism
[3:10:07] <%phatmac16> Yoda race
[3:10:15] <%spacehouse> Yoda's race is KERMIT
[3:10:18] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> What a moron.
[3:10:18] <%DatAsuna> that is a cool attack style
[3:10:19] <%derap41> The Yordles
[3:10:20] <lotharrio> Yaddle lived in a pit.
[3:10:20] <arkv01> yoda came from the movie GREMLINS
[3:10:20] <dorpork> How is she racist?
[3:10:21] <%jiggy_snipe> should have said he likes cuffs for reasons Kappa
[3:10:22] <solidgoldtoast> Yaddle was Yoda's girlfriend
[3:10:22] <Zathas> This is Pat levels of undeserved hate/
[3:10:23] <damienlunas> Yoda the Yaddle?
[3:10:24] <+SmortyPuffin> yaddle is a yoda
[3:10:24] <+Ancopro> Puppet race
[3:10:25] <%CursedNobleman> the muppet race
[3:10:25] <%DatAsuna> Yaddle is the girl one
[3:10:28] <asurite_warrior> Dumb butt woolie
[3:10:28] <NeakGX> Yodes
[3:10:28] <ashenjuan25> But the passive innocuous kind of racism
[3:10:29] <+chiazam> 2
[3:10:31] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Yaddle is rule 63 Yoda
[3:10:32] <%phatmac16> Just let Woolie rant at Kira it makes him feel better
[3:10:34] <+crazyspartan214> Yoda races is the mini-orge!
[3:10:35] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Yeah, he just liked cuffs for no fucking reason.
[3:10:37] <Iwashi94> LUL
[3:10:40] <+Sebenoth> His race is muppet
[3:10:51] <ralphfromdk> Yaddle is the female one from the prequil council that was used for nothing at all.
[3:10:51] <Darth_Mama> mage shrek
[3:10:52] <dorpork> How is she being racist? Because she doesn't know what wookies are?
[3:10:56] <damienlunas> Oh my god if you go to Wookiepedia it literally just says "Yoda's Species"
[3:10:56] <+chiazam> That other guy in Kotor 1 wasn't called Yoda
[3:10:59] <+CelebrityGhost> regardless Mira has history with hanharr, so it's just weird
[3:11:00] <%phatmac16> Don’t you mean, THE CHILD?
[3:11:01] <%Ashenik1> Why could they just make Yoda unique and never have anybody his race ;d
[3:11:07] <Dehlome> so did baby yoda pop into existence when yoda died?
[3:11:10] <Halospaz117> Dude got enslaved and thought "YO SICK IDEA"
[3:11:15] <lotharrio> Life debts are a noble thing.
[3:11:19] <Camail> humans as resources
[3:11:20] <%jiggy_snipe> meh a life debt is different
[3:11:25] <%StaceMcGate> Slave Economy @WoolieVersus
[3:11:25] <Camail> or, people, rather
[3:11:29] <+Zyquux> Hanharr is not the brightest person tbh
[3:11:35] <%StaceMcGate> Slave economy is not honor bound obedience
[3:11:36] <%correctedsun117> A life debt is owed, slavery is taken
[3:11:36] <%jiggy_snipe> especially since most people don't want the debt
[3:11:36] <solidgoldtoast> Hanharr got introduced to Capitalism and it all went down hill from there
[3:11:37] <Doodle_Taco> Madclaw
[3:11:38] <+evbites> madclaw
[3:11:38] <dereks0n> MADCLAW
[3:11:40] <+Kirbachev> Being personally indentured and running industrial-scale slavery are two VERY different things.
[3:11:40] <lotharrio> You're thinking of Madclaw
[3:11:40] <PunkZedB> *Gets enslaved* "That's Rad!"
[3:11:42] <%DatAsuna> Yaddle also had a rad 300 moment where she punched a buncha advosek off a cliff
[3:11:42] <%jiggy_snipe> the debtor imposes it
[3:11:43] <%jillpilled> it's madCLAW DISEASE
[3:11:45] <%Ashenik1> Wookie knew slavery but not BIG STONKS SLAVERY
[3:11:45] <%DatAsuna> madclaw yea
[3:11:46] <%RioGascar> Neither of these characters seem particularly bright
[3:11:47] <arkv01> we're going to have to put these wookies in farms and milk them
[3:11:48] <%phatmac16> Madclaw
[3:11:49] <%Malik1002> life debt maybe more religious then enslavement
[3:11:49] <Joostebrood> I mean African tribes understood slavery but probably found chattel slavery kinda other level probably
[3:11:50] <dereks0n> Claws are tools, not weapons
[3:11:52] <%Jetzord> Madclaw but you gotta unsheath the talons first
[3:11:53] <%CursedNobleman> i interpreted that killing a clansman a bit differently LUL
[3:11:54] <ralphfromdk> Life debt you can still like the one you now serve. See Han and Chevvie. Slaves tend to not like their masters.
[3:12:03] <megamirk> wait, one fucking wookie exploded two worlds?
[3:12:04] <$xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> He's sooo cool
[3:12:11] <CrypticMochi> There’s always like one Yoda around to give advice about the force or something like that, right?
[3:12:11] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:12:14] <%StaceMcGate> HANHAR UNCHAINED
[3:12:19] <+prime_name> More Warcrimes!
[3:12:22] <GHouseduivel> Hanhar planet Killer
[3:12:24] <%DatAsuna> hanharr wants his reparations
[3:12:26] <%Malik1002> WOW SO WE MISSED OUT ON THE KKK WOOKIE
[3:12:30] <solidgoldtoast> COLONY DROP
[3:12:32] <RantingRavager> HANHAR THE ENSLAVER
[3:12:36] <gandalfsmagicgaydick> Nah Hanhar is pretty lame in party
[3:12:37] <%JeromeMci> You wissed out on a massive slaving murderer
[3:12:40] <+Williamld> He is monumentally stupid
[3:12:41] <zocano> Hanharr, while fairly straight forward, is still interesting to learn about
[3:12:42] <+prime_name> WHAT AN AMAZING MISSED OPPORTUNITY
[3:12:43] <%tearfuldevil> hanhaar is super salty
[3:12:45] <%CursedNobleman> Hanharr the blind KKK Wookie LUL
[3:12:46] <+thatotherblackkid> Hanharr: The Best Wookie
[3:12:46] <ralphfromdk> Both this chick and Hanhar are not right in the head it would seem :D
[3:12:47] <blackskulldragon18> is he a Collector
[3:12:50] <%correctedsun117> So you're saying he's a Yautja?
[3:12:51] <RrenKrieg> he basically became a Yautja Predator
[3:12:51] <%RioGascar> both sound incredibly stupid
[3:12:52] <RantingRavager> s m o o t h
[3:12:53] <+chiazam> whoa
[3:12:55] <ATPsoldat> @Malik1002 The image of a wookie wearing a KKK outfit is too hilarious.
[3:12:58] <alrobot2014> hanharr was hunting the most dangerous game and got fucked
[3:12:59] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @StaceMcGate I like the way you growl boi LUL
[3:13:01] <arkv01> the weird human fucker hutt
[3:13:02] <megamirk> hairy space hitler
[3:13:05] <%jiggy_snipe> BIG RED
[3:13:05] <GHouseduivel> @ATPsoldat LUL
[3:13:06] <DSD24> Seems like both of these characters are assholes
[3:13:08] <solidgoldtoast> I think the word you're looking for is cool Woolie
[3:13:09] <jorniev> PRO SLAVERY
[3:13:09] <+chiazam> that's metal as fuck
[3:13:19] <shutupandjam3465> is hanharr the only star wars example of a sociopath?
[3:13:23] <+oda_flobunaga> Hanhar=Uncle Rukus of the wookies
[3:13:25] <shutupandjam3465> or psychpath?
[3:13:26] <+SmortyPuffin> did she imply that was a paedo hutt?
[3:13:27] <asurite_warrior> You shuld of killed everyone while looking them in the eye as you choke the life from them.
[3:13:33] <%2hutown> Man, theres this wookie that was enslaved czerka and now he wants to enslave humans. Its weird, its like he wants vengeance or something....
[3:13:36] <Halospaz117> FOOOOOOL
[3:13:37] <jorniev> it's a revenge slaver
[3:13:41] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @shutupandjam3465 No bro...tons of sith are like that
[3:13:44] <megamirk> so she knows the concept of the life debt, but doesn't know the name "wookie"
[3:13:58] <%Malik1002> I LIKE HOW TALKING TO MIRA IS JUST TALKING ABOUT THE BETTER AND MORE COOLER CHARACTER
[3:14:00] <gandalfsmagicgaydick> Multiple races have life debts, see Gungans
[3:14:00] <%DatAsuna> tbflife debts are relatively common
[3:14:02] <+prime_name> Genetic slavery?
[3:14:07] <%jiggy_snipe> that is weird that she's knows this stuff but not is race specifically
[3:14:08] <zocano> @Malik1002 yep
[3:14:09] <megamirk> oh ok
[3:14:11] <ATPsoldat> Cultural slavery basically
[3:14:20] <Prevot> ANGERY
[3:14:21] <Jaku2011> @megamirk Hanharr probably explained it angrily
[3:14:23] <%derap41> Edge Wookie
[3:14:23] <lotharrio> Hanharr is fucking nuts, Woolie.
[3:14:23] <%RioGascar> But you can deny your culture
[3:14:24] <GHouseduivel> Wookies are an extreme race Woolie
[3:14:24] <DSD24> Hanharr seems like a dick
[3:14:25] <%StaceMcGate> Xenophobe Woolie
[3:14:25] <asurite_warrior> Hanharr was school shooter wookie
[3:14:25] <zocano> Learning the actual context through Hanharr makes it much clearer
[3:14:31] <+MillerLowlife> memetic slavery
[3:14:32] <%jillpilled> Hanhar becomes a misanthrope on a universal scale
[3:14:33] <%jiggy_snipe> Hanharr sounds kinda dumb ngl
[3:14:33] <%StaceMcGate> Fanatic Xenophobe in fact
[3:14:35] <socratetris> Never heard of Misanthropy?
[3:14:35] <%alpharius88> He is the biggest wookie EDGE lord
[3:14:36] <damienlunas> He was a slave and decided all other living things should die
[3:14:36] <megamirk> Hanharr is that OC Sonic character
[3:14:37] <Halospaz117> ALL OF THEM
[3:14:38] <sonicblade38> darth wookie
[3:14:39] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Hanharr was a crazy person
[3:14:40] <+chiazam> ANGER
[3:14:41] <dereks0n> Hanharr's generic too, let's be honest
[3:14:42] <+oda_flobunaga> HULHHARR
[3:14:44] <%jiggy_snipe> he's chracter is HATE HATE HATE
[3:14:48] <Joostebrood> Avellone trope time
[3:14:48] <%derap41> Crawling in my fur these wounds ´they will not heal
[3:14:49] <%CursedNobleman> these wounds will not HEAL
[3:14:50] <+oda_flobunaga> HULKHARR
[3:14:51] <ATPsoldat> Coldsteel the Edgekie
[3:14:52] <+prime_name> So, Anakin is Hanharr?
[3:14:53] <Mrbaconator> WOOKIE SASUKE
[3:14:54] <Prevot> sounds like a very dumb edgy character
[3:14:58] <%Ashenik1> anti natalist
[3:14:58] <Doodle_Taco> HUNHARR THE UCHIHA
[3:15:02] <lotharrio> He's a "rawr I hate you" dog.
[3:15:04] <+chiazam> Hanharr - fuck everything and everyone
[3:15:06] <zocano> The actual context you learn through Hanharr is pretty decent
[3:15:07] <%jiggy_snipe> Hanharr the Uchiha LUL
[3:15:08] <jorniev> the woolie is mentally ill woolie
[3:15:08] <asurite_warrior> haaaa
[3:15:10] <%HostilePoundcakes> LUL
[3:15:10] <Camail> special eyes
[3:15:12] <RantingRavager> HANHAR, YOU ARE MY FRIEND
[3:15:13] <%jaytitan96> I MEAN
[3:15:13] <+Zyquux> You think Hanharr has tons of depth, but that's pretty much the extent of his character. Just angry edgy Woolie slaver.
[3:15:14] <%TheFabledAble> @WoolieVersus Think about what would drive a black person in the 1800s to be a slaver. Thats basically hanhar's mindset
[3:15:17] <%BallerSwagBro9k> GROWLJUTSU
[3:15:19] <Klefth> Hanhaar O'Doyle
[3:15:24] <%spacehouse> woolie Sharingan

[3:15:25] <damienlunas> Hanharr sat alone on the swing
[3:15:27] <+oda_flobunaga> Mira got that Nakama
[3:15:27] <jorniev> I meant the woolie lol
[3:15:32] <rubbishbinge> The curse of hatred is stronk
[3:15:34] <+serpenttucker> Can't escape from hating fate
[3:15:36] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @DatAsuna Thats great LUL
[3:15:36] <asurite_warrior> Hanharr lived in the deep forest, I think it was called the dark lands?
[3:15:42] <%jiggy_snipe> this is stupid
[3:15:45] <Apolonm> Hanharr THE COOLEST GUY
[3:15:56] <solidgoldtoast> THE COOLEST
[3:16:01] <ashenjuan25> His commentary on the culture of The Wookiee in the dark side run is awesome tho
[3:16:02] <%jiggy_snipe> its so stupid that I don't trust Mira's explanation LUL
[3:16:03] <jorniev> I MEANT wookie... I keep saying to e woolie
[3:16:04] <+chiazam> HEY GUYS, Remember when Hanharr had MIRA BY THE THROAT
[3:16:11] <%RioGascar> Does hanharr not understand what the lfie debt is
[3:16:13] <megamirk> at least we're not talking to Carth Onasi
[3:16:14] <Shade075> COOLEST GUY
[3:16:31] <%jillpilled> Hanhar: I hate you because you spared me! [Mira or some human decides to kill him] YOU HUMANS ARE ALL THE SAME
[3:16:35] <jorniev> hanharr is mentally ill
[3:16:47] <+prime_name> Wookie Terminator
[3:16:48] <+griffball13> wookie terminator
[3:16:49] <megamirk> hanharr is Joe Pesci in Casino

[3:17:14] <gruulmagebeast> light now hanharr later
[3:17:15] <%StaceMcGate> Kappa
[3:17:17] <+Zyquux> School shooter Wookie is accurate

[3:17:28] <%jillpilled> @optimasmaximas he's definitely lol

[3:17:38] <Shade075> LUL
[3:17:43] <%RioGascar> so i think we’re safe
[3:17:43] <%xcompleasedad> Fucking Xenomorph that shit
[3:17:48] <+chiazam> I lke the idea of him hunting the party rather than being a part of it
[3:17:53] <%alpharius88> "SHOOOKER" i mean "MIRA"
[3:18:14] <Shade075> The only interesting part of Mira is her talking about Hanhaar LUL
[3:18:15] <%Gruhunchously> Big anger ball
[3:18:22] <NeakGX> *does ship mind reading* "what is this growling outside the ship?"
[3:18:23] <lotharrio> He's a berserker, basically.
[3:18:26] <blackskulldragon18> you are going neutral
[3:18:30] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @mankeyfigh
[3:18:35] <solidgoldtoast> Has Woolie played Mass Effect? Would be cool to see him going through the world of those games like this
[3:18:42] <ingman112> Uhhhh will you? I don’t know if there’s another influence point for Mira in the game
[3:18:47] <silver__viii> I think you still get plenty of what makes Hanharr interesting through having him hunt you down though. Recruiting him in a Dark Side playthrough just feels like bonus info
[3:18:47] <%RioGascar> Is hanharr the kind of “too angry to die”
[3:18:50] <ATPsoldat> Woolie playing Disco Elysium would be gold.
[3:18:51] <%jiggy_snipe> oh cool
[3:18:54] <+Zyquux> Lawful Evil
[3:18:54] <Prevot> hanharr number is SO BIG
[3:18:57] <jorniev> you need these good John William points
[3:18:57] <RrenKrieg> he's a big hairy pat
[3:19:04] <lotharrio> @RioGascar Yes. He has that as an ability, I believe.
[3:19:06] <OverlordLuna> Local Wookiee too angry to die
[3:19:08] <GHouseduivel> @RedAhoge Tru
[3:19:12] <jorniev> aw yeah Disco elysium
[3:19:12] <JaseAdrift> would love to see Woolie play Disco Elisium
[3:19:12] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[3:19:14] <%Ashenik1> He is not able to think outside of the box
[3:19:16] <dorpork> the TRUE lesson of strength is one of the best parts of the game
[3:19:20] <RrenKrieg> his mind goblins trap him
[3:19:25] <%Gruhunchously> His mind goblins
[3:19:26] <gruulmagebeast> his origin is pretty cool
[3:19:28] <%TheFabledAble> Kreia's point was that Strength is the ability to determine your own path without constraint
[3:19:34] <+chiazam> @WoolieVersus Did you ask Handmaiden about her name?
[3:19:35] <megamirk> a slaver is a slave to his mentality
[3:19:36] <ATPsoldat> @dorpork So many dark side runs miss that point
[3:19:37] <megamirk> bravo Kojima
[3:19:43] <ingman112> Legit I think you’re cut out of Mira content
[3:19:43] <%RioGascar> now is it wookies culture that trap hanharr?
[3:19:47] <%deviljhojho_> its symbolic
[3:19:47] <RrenKrieg> genius kojumbo
[3:19:50] <%deviljhojho_> like a beach
[3:19:52] <GHouseduivel> Kojimbo did it again
[3:19:52] <%deviljhojho_> or a strand
[3:19:56] <%RioGascar> Or his own sorta creed and code
[3:19:57] <%jiggy_snipe> so physically strong but mentally weak?
[3:20:00] <megamirk> hanharr means "beach" in wookie
[3:20:06] <ATPsoldat> We got light sided with Mira earlier anyway
[3:20:11] <%jillpilled> he does explore a pretty depressing topic of ig like psychosis associated with slavery entrapping someone
[3:20:14] <+oda_flobunaga> 48 planets to go
[3:20:15] <Joostebrood> i mean one of those planets is more like half a planet
[3:20:16] <Halospaz117> 40% maybbe?
[3:20:19] <arkv01> we're ONLY 2 planet deep in this bitch? hoo boy!
[3:20:20] <Joostebrood> one of those left*
[3:20:25] <zocano> ya you're like 45%
[3:20:33] <zocano> though Korriban is fairly short
[3:20:34] <RrenKrieg> more like 33%
[3:20:34] <%Gruhunchously> Technically 1 and a half planets
[3:20:38] <GHouseduivel> She has a Caesar haircut
[3:20:43] <%heartlesshealer> not even an influence check
[3:20:49] <%kyh9> Hi NotImportant
[3:20:49] <%Ashenik1> Karen
[3:20:56] <+Zyquux> KISS HER
[3:20:58] <+oda_flobunaga> If I don't know your name I can't scream it later bitch!
[3:21:03] <jorniev> KAR EN
[3:21:06] <%Gruhunchously> Hey there Not Important
[3:21:07] <%jiggy_snipe> what
[3:21:12] <GHouseduivel> I want to speak to the Jedi Master. Right this minute.
[3:21:20] <+griffball13> corpse nothing
[3:21:23] <megamirk> her name is... Nanaki
[3:21:25] <Halospaz117> Oh god she's Hatred
[3:21:33] <gruulmagebeast> Nott Important
[3:21:37] <arkv01> two t's followed by a string of exclamation marks
[3:21:37] <DSD24> A lot of talking
[3:21:42] <%StaceMcGate> Handmaiden XIII
[3:21:44] <solidgoldtoast> Her name is Madara Uchiha
[3:21:44] <prince_johnny_> GG
[3:21:45] <+chiazam> !uptime
[3:21:45] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 21 minutes
[3:21:48] <jorniev> her meme is Skywalker
[3:21:51] <ATPsoldat> Not Important is such a joke of an edgelord.
[3:21:52] <%Gruhunchously> New planets
[3:21:53] <megamirk> did they do the Dxun stuff already?
[3:21:56] <+SolidusRex> Correction, old planets from KotOR 1
[3:21:59] <RantingRavager> BibleThump
[3:22:04] <zocano> Ya they finished up Dxun
[3:22:06] <gruulmagebeast> dantooine or korriban next?
[3:22:09] <GHouseduivel> Shocking
[3:22:13] <megamirk> @zocano cool, thanks
[3:22:17] <%Ashenik1> Dantooine has to be
[3:22:20] <%ThePimpGuin> her real identity if obito all along
[3:22:24] <Sedrelic> every planet should explode after leaving
[3:22:24] <%JeromeMci> Dropin those convo nuggets
[3:22:29] <+chiazam> We basically went to that planet just to collect Mandalore
[3:22:33] <solidgoldtoast> Anyone else feel it would be really cool to see Woolie going through Mass Effect?
[3:22:35] <notenoughgirls> theres an influence oppurtunity on dantooine but i legit think you might have to choose between goto and mira
[3:22:36] <vigilant00> We were this close to greatness.
[3:22:40] <arkv01> damn V's hair is wilin'
[3:22:43] <%OldManDeckardCain> A SCALPEL
[3:22:44] <megamirk> I want them to reach the moment already
[3:22:48] <megamirk> you know which one
[3:22:51] <%royb2> If this lunch break time or full end?
[3:22:53] <zocano> There's a specific quick slaughter you can do right at the start of Dantooine
[3:22:58] <%CommanderSqueaks> !uptime
[3:22:58] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 23 minutes
[3:23:02] <zocano> Like literally right at the startr
[3:23:02] <%metalbane> At least now we know HK's into Cog and Bolt Torture
[3:23:07] <%correctedsun117> Are we taking a break, or was that KOTOR for the day?
[3:23:21] <%Malik1002> @woolieversus SOOO WOOLIE THE ENDS JUSTIFY THE MEANS
[3:23:24] <%DatAsuna> That bodes poorly
[3:23:28] <Halospaz117> This is usually break time I think
[3:23:30] <%heartlesshealer> =)
[3:23:37] <jorniev> GOOD LATER
[3:23:38] <%afronooch> I dont think woolie could do the shootey of mass effect 1
[3:23:42] <+yaroslev_tartakovsky> That's why I'm glad I played this before 1
[3:23:53] <%Gruhunchously> An understandable mindset
[3:23:53] <%DatAsuna> the shooty of me1 is easy enough
[3:23:55] <+Zyquux> I will never forgive V if we somehow miss HK's unique upgrade.
[3:24:00] <+Loinclothiclese> @afronooch wooly just cant shoot
[3:24:04] <%tearfuldevil> @afronooch woolies played me1
[3:24:04] <solidgoldtoast> ME1 is easy if its not on insanity
[3:24:05] <%CommanderSqueaks> @afronooch To be fair, the shooty in Mass Effect 1 isn't great. 2 improves it SO MUCH.
[3:24:06] <%RioGascar> Thing is this game was before the whole save game transfers happened
[3:24:08] <%DatAsuna> He knows not to miss it
[3:24:09] <+prime_name> More than half of everything would be missed
[3:24:14] <zocano> Ya I missed a lot of influence on my first playthrough
[3:24:17] <%DatAsuna> Absolutely
[3:24:28] <%tearfuldevil> @CommanderSqueaks its more polished, but i don't actually like how cover shooty ME2 is
[3:24:30] <%heartlesshealer> 14 months
[3:24:33] <zocano> I only made Handmaiden a jedi
[3:24:34] <cherrycottontail> actual trees
[3:24:35] <Camail> yup
[3:24:36] <alrobot2014> its kinda like a vn
[3:24:38] <lotharrio> That's Obsidian for you.
[3:24:40] <+prime_name> Good analogy
[3:24:42] <+oda_flobunaga> Dialog trees= kudzu
[3:24:44] <%RioGascar> kid me missed so many things
[3:24:49] <%heartlesshealer> polygonal visual novel
[3:24:53] <%RioGascar> and also kid me barely beat this game
[3:25:00] <Jaku2011> I like Mass Effect 3's combat a lot I played a ton of the multiplayer
[3:25:06] <%perfectsalami> Playing as you want vs maximizing content
[3:25:06] <jorniev> Disco elysium
[3:25:07] <%Javaa01> This is CRPG tradition, and if you want interconnecting and intermingling dialogue trees, go play Divinity Original Sin 2
[3:25:12] <%RioGascar> the telos fights were the hardest shit
[3:25:13] <zocano> Min-maxing the influence is super unintuitive
[3:25:16] <privatesargent> and thats probably why they don't WANT you to get everything
[3:25:16] <%kyh9> @Jaku2011 Yeah, ME3's Horde mode was kind of brilliantly made
[3:25:16] <DSD24> @Jaku2011 That multiplayer was great
[3:25:19] <%CommanderSqueaks> See, this is why I love Alpha Protocol explicitly paints the main character as a person whose main ability IS to tell people EXACTLY what they want to hear.
[3:25:21] <%jiggy_snipe> you are a chracter that plays to other people not yourself
[3:25:23] <+Ancopro> purple links mod
[3:25:33] <%Gruhunchously> Grey out dialogue, yeah
[3:25:33] <%DatAsuna> I adored the ME3 MP, I grinded my way to the top 2% of the N7 leadrboard
[3:25:34] <%afronooch> Not challenge, it does the movement stuff we doesnt like right?
[3:25:34] <DSD24> Alpha Protocol had amazing dialogue
[3:25:39] <%DatAsuna> bbut my friend was top 1%
[3:25:42] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> There was an rpg that did that, but I cant remember what it was
[3:25:42] <zocano> Bless Alpha Protocol
[3:25:45] <+xerotwo> LITTLE V doodScrub
[3:25:46] <privatesargent> these games are made for multiple playthroughs, which doesn't really work for a Let's Play formate
[3:25:48] <DSD24> Outer Worlds was ok
[3:25:49] <%optimasmaximas> outer worlds is great
[3:25:49] <Camail> outworlds is a big OK
[3:25:50] <Halospaz117> Alpha Protocol deserved better
[3:25:52] <Rixstarian> @kyh9 Andromeda's was a horrible attempt to duplicate
[3:25:52] <+xerotwo> OH SHIT!!!!
[3:25:53] <Jaku2011> Outer Worlds is super ok
[3:25:55] <GHouseduivel> OOF
[3:25:57] <%heartlesshealer> Moon Man from Outer Worlds ;^;
[3:25:58] <zocano> Alpha Protocol is their second best game
[3:25:58] <CastellanVon> Oh damn
[3:25:59] <@Menitta> I gotta finish Outer Worlds
[3:26:00] <Camail> i got bored as hell at the end tho

[3:26:13] <@Menitta> or just play Disco Elysium
[3:26:13] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1260094696292048899
[3:26:14] <%kyh9> @Rixstarian Yeah; the ability to jump around like crazy actually reduce the strategic decisions to make
[3:26:17] <%Javaa01> VATS is free aimbot
[3:26:22] <DSD24> @Gruhunchously Really that's cool!
[3:26:23] <zocano> Ya New Vegas on consoles was BUSTED
[3:26:27] <%DatAsuna> @Rixstarian tbf launch andromeda mp was way better than launch me3 mp, me3 mp came into it's own after the second expansion
[3:26:32] <%JeromeMci> That Bethesda engine man.
[3:26:32] <jorniev> oof
[3:26:34] <Rixstarian> @kyh9 Even the enemy variety was so uninspired
[3:26:39] <+xerotwo> doodScrub doodScrub doodScrub doodScrub
[3:26:44] <%RioGascar> i have a different thing that locks the game
[3:26:49] <%jillpilled> god New Vegas on console was a disaster because of that garbage engine
[3:26:57] <Zathas> Pillars of Eternity is pretty good. And although I get the idea behind adding in all the backer content to the game, I feel that having that all in there adds a lot of weird bloat that makes playing the game feel weird.
[3:26:59] <%kyh9> @Rixstarian True, the four factions in ME3's multiplayer were really distinct
[3:27:05] <%tearfuldevil> although PT jedi = / = OT jedi
[3:27:05] <GHouseduivel> Your mother has to stay in slavery Anakin, the force wills it
[3:27:07] <+chiazam> Will we have a second session today?
[3:27:07] <%DatAsuna> It's really only shown by obi-wan saying it after the council scene.
[3:27:08] <+oda_flobunaga> Bet a ship I don't own on the life of a slave
[3:27:09] <%RioGascar> xbox version launch of fallout 3 the pitt dlc. If you entered at level 20 it crashs the game
[3:27:11] <%DatAsuna> It is clunky
[3:27:15] <Rixstarian> @datasuna Well, MEA had the problem of bad antagonist factions
[3:27:15] <%CommanderSqueaks> @zathas Most of that was just rando npcs tho.
[3:27:16] <%tearfuldevil> the OT jedi weren't written with the rpequels inmind
[3:27:17] <+oda_flobunaga> wtf
[3:27:22] <notenoughgirls> poorly executed
[3:27:22] <solidgoldtoast> Then The Last Jedi would never have happened
[3:27:39] <%correctedsun117> Holy shit, Mark Hamill is older than Liam Neeson
[3:27:45] <solidgoldtoast> Wha?
[3:27:51] <+evbites> wha
[3:28:09] <ralphfromdk> Still around.... so nothing changed you say? :p
[3:28:24] <%DatAsuna> Qui-gon's compassion is thin but mostly only shown by obi-wan comparative callousness and one time saying so.
[3:28:24] <%RioGascar> Well luke would be dead i think
[3:28:27] <lotharrio> Yoda and Obi would have NEVER told him that.
[3:28:29] <%Malik1002> @woolieversus answer: to previous question about luke if I missed the early convo. Luke did change alot about the jedi teaching first off let the jedi marry, let the jedi explore the fillings, and let them wear whatever they want and make friends
[3:28:30] <%CommanderSqueaks> Which was kind of IMPORTANT information.
[3:28:32] <%RioGascar> His dad saved him
[3:28:33] <%RioGascar> Also
[3:28:39] <KaitlynnHere> it wurked
[3:28:42] <%ThePimpGuin> imagine he learned that in his final fight on the death star lol
[3:28:43] <+oda_flobunaga> 410 billion dead younglings though
[3:28:46] <%RioGascar> “That boy is our last hope...NO THERE IS ANOTHER”
[3:28:52] <+Ancopro> just like nero
[3:28:56] <+xerotwo> JOIN THE DARK SIDE doodScrub
[3:29:00] <gruulmagebeast> palpatine probably would've killed him then
[3:29:07] <Zathas> @CommanderSqueaks Yeah, playing through it and running up to a named NPC just for it to be uninteractable other than ghost vision always felt like a huge letdown.
[3:29:07] <KaitlynnHere> @RioGascar me :)
[3:29:28] <%RioGascar> which most people figured at the time the other hope was leia
[3:29:37] <GHouseduivel> George Lucas ruined star wars
[3:29:37] <%CommanderSqueaks> @zathas Didn't they explicitly color the NPC names of backer NPCS blue or something that made it obvious which and which wasn't a backer npc?
[3:29:39] <+oda_flobunaga> Sequals not cannon
[3:29:44] <akman14> It's almost like the sequels are shit
[3:29:49] <+eanscrale> That's why they call them JeDIE HA HA ha ha...
[3:29:52] <%DatAsuna> Yeah pretty much
[3:29:55] <%phatmac16> True
[3:29:56] <%tearfuldevil> @Malik1002 the thing is, those weren't really "changes", because the PT rules about no marriage hadn't been thought up yet in the old EU novels. They only became changes n the post PT stuff like NJO
[3:29:58] <KaitlynnHere> it's a movie so you're not supposed to think about it
[3:30:02] <%Ashenik1> If prequels were remade to be actauly good would that work for Pat to like Vader?
[3:30:03] <Zathas> @CommanderSqueaks That's something I realized later on, yeah.
[3:30:04] <Jaku2011> Sequels bad and Dusney knows it
[3:30:05] <KaitlynnHere> you're supposed to read the buuks
[3:30:07] <Joostebrood> honestly that part of TLJ i was fine with it's just the stupid-ass excursion to Planet Predatory Capitalism that turned me off
[3:30:18] <%phatmac16> Rian Johnson just gave in his first script and didn’t think much of the story
[3:30:18] <%alpacasintophats> I feel like you're writing for Johnson when you say things like that
[3:30:20] <%DatAsuna> No, because he formed the order before that as strict adherents, but yes in legends he made many dark jedi too.
[3:30:28] <%Irridium> wait what
[3:30:30] <Tucker0603> WHAT?!?!
[3:30:32] <308caliber> oh shit
[3:30:33] <Halospaz117> YEP
[3:30:34] <Doodle_Taco> The problem is that they didn't give enough context for teacher look, so it comes off as forced
[3:30:35] <%DatAsuna> One less i but yeah
[3:30:35] <%optimasmaximas> yup
[3:30:36] <%HostilePoundcakes> Fucking what
[3:30:40] <Tucker0603> THATS FUCKING DUMB!!!!!
[3:30:40] <Jaku2011> huh
[3:30:42] <%tearfuldevil> WHAT
[3:30:42] <+Zyquux> Wait what
[3:30:43] <lotharrio> ...oh? Huh.
[3:30:43] <+jake5713> That pissed me the fuck off.
[3:30:43] <+SarcFa> a lot of this is Rian Johnson not being able to play nice in an established property
[3:30:46] <+zooeymainbtw> lol
[3:30:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> OH NO
[3:30:48] <KaitlynnHere> shhh
[3:30:50] <ht109> lmao
[3:30:51] <%jillpilled> REALLY?
[3:30:51] <+SarcFa> he's fine with his own one off shit
[3:30:55] <+evbites> oh right
[3:30:56] <+chiazam> ooooopsssss
[3:30:56] <%phatmac16> Dumb
[3:30:59] <Dangerzone979> Hey JJ maybe that's something that should have been addressed?!?!?
[3:31:00] <+eanscrale> oh shit YEAH
[3:31:01] <%correctedsun117> Oh dear
[3:31:01] <Heyestus> Boy that sure sounds like a bunch of expanded universe stuff that doesn't apply to the movies' narrative.
[3:31:03] <%DatAsuna> That's a good one too lol
[3:31:05] <%alpacasintophats> hell that was back in Empire era too
[3:31:06] <+zooeymainbtw> sequel trilogy is not very good
[3:31:06] <+oda_flobunaga> . .
[3:31:06] <Tucker0603> FUUCK THE SEQUELS!!!!!
[3:31:07] <nobody12349> Luke ain't a snitch
[3:31:08] <Djinnazz> Fallen Order confirms they were they for a LONG time.
[3:31:08] <cipher758> Planet sized death star
[3:31:09] <Halospaz117> Illum, no second I
[3:31:09] <KaitlynnHere> but it's not cannon anymore tho
[3:31:09] <%Irridium> Hey JJ what the fuck
[3:31:09] <%jillpilled> ...
[3:31:10] <jorniev> WHAT
[3:31:11] <%jiggy_snipe> Luke: nothing to see here
[3:31:17] <KaitlynnHere> oh wait
[3:31:17] <%DatAsuna> thanks abrams
[3:31:18] <Camail> they hid it under a rug
[3:31:19] <vulkan_vibes> WHAT???
[3:31:23] <+oda_flobunaga> NOT CANON
[3:31:30] <+oda_flobunaga> did not happen
[3:31:32] <vulkan_vibes> sources V, sources???
[3:31:33] <Prevot> like a david cage game huh
[3:31:33] <%Gruhunchously> ???
[3:31:34] <jorniev> what the hell
[3:31:38] <%DatAsuna> because reference
[3:31:39] <%correctedsun117> You know what you should think about? The Darth Vader comic
[3:31:41] <%RioGascar> To be fair, illium Was ESTABLISHED AS STAR KILLER in jedi fallen order. NOT THE SEQUELS
[3:31:43] <KaitlynnHere> because it sounded evil
[3:31:43] <Djinnazz> the charge the laser
[3:31:44] <+evbites> kyper crystals
[3:31:45] <+eanscrale> So wither Luke is really an asshole, or the new republic is even MORE incompetent.
[3:31:45] <Joestar1890> And Jedha (which also has kyber crystals) was blown half the fuck up
[3:31:48] <lotharrio> What about the hyperspace kamikaze attack being a one in a million shot? Doesn't that mean the admiral wasn't trying to take out the enemy capital ship, she was trying to run away while the rest of the Resistance died?
[3:31:48] <vulkan_vibes> I MIST KNOW THE SOURCE
[3:31:51] <%tearfuldevil> anyone who tlaks about "the sequels breaking canon" probably wasn't into the EU pre PT
[3:31:51] <%cylish> Death star tech is basically a giant lightsaber
[3:31:57] <%alpacasintophats> yeah shit like that is why I don't consider the sequel trilogy cannon. Even if it does have some interesting shit sometimes.
[3:31:57] <Joostebrood> at the very least TLJ had something more intuitive than 'Death Star but 100x bigger' or 'Star Destroyers but 10000x more'
[3:31:58] <+oda_flobunaga> the last Star Wars movie was Revenge of the Sith
[3:31:58] <+Nobrev> Illum isnt the only planet you go to for crystals but it's a big one
[3:32:03] <KaitlynnHere> @cylish makes sense
[3:32:04] <GarbageNirvana> That's what happens when you get three different writers and directors to try to write one cohesive story
[3:32:07] <%Irridium> yeah no that was just a new planet they made to blow up LUL
[3:32:11] <%RioGascar> illum was first shown in the clone wars
[3:32:12] <%LozsCat> @vulkan_vibes Jedi Fallen Order
[3:32:12] <Joestar1890> They blew up "Hosnian Peime"
[3:32:15] <Joestar1890> Prime
[3:32:15] <+oda_flobunaga> Darthomir?
[3:32:21] <GarbageNirvana> ...actually wait did they get Abrams back for RoS I forget
[3:32:21] <+yaroslev_tartakovsky> cuh-roo-skant?
[3:32:24] <vulkan_vibes> oh shit is that it makes sense but damn. lightsaber machine broke
[3:32:31] <KaitlynnHere> it's like harry popper
[3:32:34] <jorniev> man they really should have come up with the story together instead
[3:32:38] <CrmznOgre> crystal costco
[3:32:39] <KaitlynnHere> picking your wand
[3:32:39] <@Menitta> I liked the old lore of the crystals being manufactured
[3:32:40] <+evbites> maybe luke just picked it up from yoda
[3:32:41] <Joestar1890> @GarbageNirvana Yeah, they did
[3:32:41] <privatesargent> people who say its not canon cause it was in Fallen Order, isn't the whole point of getting rid of the EU so all things new can be in canon?
[3:32:42] <vulkan_vibes> LIGHTSABER MACHINE BROKE
[3:32:45] <@Menitta> thats way cooler
[3:32:47] <+eanscrale> That's so bad
[3:32:48] <GHouseduivel> Ha, Sith-asize it
[3:32:48] <+oda_flobunaga> Dantoine
[3:32:52] <%JeromeMci> It's times like that where you need the equivilant of the DC animated bible. One of the reason the animated shows / features are so good.
[3:32:57] <%heartlesshealer> waterboard the crystals
[3:33:02] <%vincerocmm> torcher a cristal huh
[3:33:08] <akman14> Isn't Ilium a planet in mass effect?
[3:33:09] <%CommanderSqueaks> You could have literally just put it ANYWHERE else.
[3:33:11] <+oda_flobunaga> Isn't Illium an asari planet?
[3:33:17] <+zooeymainbtw> The sequel trilogy should have went all in on nostalgia from the start or been completely different from the start
[3:33:17] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:33:24] <+rider_megalon> thats like if some one blow up Dunes Spice plant
[3:33:26] <Pappajimbo> where did rey get her crystal?
[3:33:28] <alrobot2014> @oda_flobunaga sure is
[3:33:33] <vulkan_vibes> illum is a historical reference. commonly recycled name
[3:33:33] <Joestar1890> I don't know why people think living kyber crystals is lamer than synthetic crystals, "Bleeding" sounds like a cool concept
[3:33:38] <%RioGascar> again illum was established as star killer not in the sequels. but in jedi fallen order.
[3:33:39] <+jake5713> Ilium in Mass Effect, Ilum in Star Wars.
[3:33:39] <CrmznOgre> do crystal choose their owner or no?
[3:33:41] <KaitlynnHere> @Pappajimbo her butt
[3:33:43] <KaitlynnHere> next
[3:33:57] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[3:33:57] <T_Sasquatch> stop thinking
[3:34:00] <%DatAsuna> THat one is just for lulz
[3:34:01] <%heartlesshealer> =)
[3:34:01] <+evbites> baby yoda did
[3:34:02] <GHouseduivel> That's the work of a sith
[3:34:03] <privatesargent> @RioGascar i think most people consider Fallen Order part of canon
[3:34:05] <OverlordLuna> NotLikeThis
[3:34:06] <+oda_flobunaga> Kyle Katarn invented force healing
[3:34:10] <%optimasmaximas> neither is rey
[3:34:10] <%derap41> And how good is Rey
[3:34:12] <vulkan_vibes> it's a really instinctual technique iirc
[3:34:13] <solidgoldtoast> Rei has had the force for like a month though
[3:34:13] <%Jetzord> Technically Baby Yoda invented force healing
[3:34:15] <asylumkon> obi wasnt a high enough level
[3:34:15] <Doodle_Taco> Its because Rey is better you fool Kappa
[3:34:18] <T_Sasquatch> mary s*e
[3:34:19] <%derap41> Superior Genes
[3:34:20] <%jiggy_snipe> V that's not a good explanation LUL
[3:34:20] <%BallerSwagBro9k> REY HAD NO TRAINING
[3:34:23] <GHouseduivel> Shut up don't worry about it
[3:34:23] <%OldManDeckardCain> rey is a naruto Kappa
[3:34:23] <KaitlynnHere> no she's a skywalker tho
[3:34:23] <Joestar1890> Couldn't Qui gon heal himself
[3:34:30] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Imsoverylazy
[3:34:30] <KaitlynnHere> memememember
[3:34:30] <%Gruhunchously> Obi Wan hadn't learned the *techniques*
[3:34:32] <%correctedsun117> Why did Anakin turn to Palpatine to save his wife if Heal was a thing?
[3:34:35] <+zooeymainbtw> rayruto uzapalpatine
[3:34:37] <solidgoldtoast> Sorry
[3:34:38] <Augus7717> padawan for 10+ years and rey had training for 1 year
[3:34:42] <%DatAsuna> Big it's funny, so
[3:34:43] <Heyestus> There's never been Force healing in the films because it was invented to justify game mechanics.
[3:34:44] <%RioGascar> technically NO ONE SHOULD BE DYING
[3:34:45] <+eanscrale> Yeah Rey got that xtra Pulp
[3:34:47] <%DatAsuna> *but
[3:34:48] <+oda_flobunaga> Rey=Sakura, Po=Naruto, ?+Sasuke?
[3:34:51] <%heartlesshealer> all of sequel is non-canon garbage
[3:34:53] <%perfectsalami> The problem is that the force has the superman problem, in that it is technically limitless, and different writers make it as strong as it needs to be
[3:34:53] <%phatmac16> Mah ray SUEEEEE
[3:34:58] <Tucker0603> fuck Disney
[3:35:01] <%RioGascar> its a beam of light that cauterizes wound
[3:35:02] <%correctedsun117> Post 6
[3:35:02] <+rider_megalon> its like Heal is a importent skill to learn
[3:35:03] <ralphfromdk> Palpatine wasn't lying to Anakin :o only the dark side could heal the dying!!!! :o
[3:35:04] <+eanscrale> Her blood is BETTER thjo
[3:35:04] <%phatmac16> fuck off

[3:35:10] <%RioGascar> So if you get it through your chest
[3:35:11] <jorniev> genes define your super powers
[3:35:14] <%phatmac16> Rei is the worst
[3:35:14] <%spacehouse> Rey is a HEAL GIRL
[3:35:16] <%LozsCat> No
[3:35:16] <%RioGascar> Yeah the organs are fucked up
[3:35:19] <+oda_flobunaga> Neji was right
[3:35:21] <%LozsCat> Post 6
[3:35:21] <KaitlynnHere> i love that rey finally gets jedi training in the very last movie. like... what? it's a waste of time at this point!
[3:35:21] <%Irridium> wait so if baby yoda can do it can't yoda? and if yoda can do it why didn't he save Padme?
[3:35:21] <vulkan_vibes> which is why you see crusty storm troopers
[3:35:22] <%CommanderSqueaks> Rey is a Heal Girl!
[3:35:24] <%Jetzord> Yes, and the Mandalorian episode came out the day before
[3:35:26] <Joestar1890> Bloodlines determine your power
[3:35:26] <%phatmac16> Rey is the HEAL GIRL
[3:35:27] <%perfectsalami> If you want to, you could also look at it like a rare force power, like how bastilla has battle meditation
[3:35:29] <+xerotwo> LUL
[3:35:30] <Freezern> Healing is a dark side talent, because death does not exist for Jedi, there is only the force @WoolieVersus
[3:35:31] <%correctedsun117> Unlike the Vader comic
[3:35:31] <+eanscrale> iza bedder blud gaiz
[3:35:32] <%RioGascar> but they are also cauterized and the bleeding stops
[3:35:32] <%heartlesshealer> the fucking HEAL GIRL trope
[3:35:32] <Joestar1890> YEP
[3:35:32] <KaitlynnHere> i couldn't even finish it

[3:36:00] <vulkan_vibes> made of her staff! Rey's gold lightsaber is dope
[3:36:00] <Heyestus> Ah yes, fan canon. The catch all for everything that was made after return of the Jedi
[3:36:02] <@Menitta> Which is extra stupid because she made one AT THE END
[3:36:02] <+evbites> REY's LIGHTSABRE and i'ts now buried in sand
[3:36:04] <Joestar1890> And Rey gets her own lightsaber at the end too, why doesn't she get it from the beginning?
[3:36:06] <+zooeymainbtw> sanity at risk
[3:36:07] <+oda_flobunaga> NON-CANON
[3:36:10] <Doodle_Taco> Chat what is worst: KH, SW or Naruto?
[3:36:14] <+Zyquux> Reminder that Battlefront 2 has 4 different characters that use the same lightsaber
[3:36:16] <ralphfromdk> And what about the yellow one she builds herself? Who's lightsaber is that then?
[3:36:18] <alrobot2014> store listing is now rey's lightsaber iirc
[3:36:19] <+zooeymainbtw> i vote KH

[3:36:21] <%phatmac16> woolieTRASH woolieTRASH woolieTRASH
[3:36:21] <+oda_flobunaga> Canon is subjective
[3:36:21] <+Deano8817> Naruto
[3:36:22] <damienlunas> "You made this? I made this."
[3:36:22] <KaitlynnHere> rey is a skypooper now, member?!
[3:36:23] <%LozsCat> Mandalorian is the end of star wars
[3:36:23] <GHouseduivel> George Lucas PunOko
[3:36:24] <Camail> 6 Forces
[3:36:32] <vulkan_vibes> Rey's lightsaber is made of her old staff
[3:36:32] <+oda_flobunaga> which is what it should be
[3:36:36] <jorniev> what
[3:36:37] <@Menitta> does this chat care about spoilers for tros lol
[3:36:42] <Camail> the nova force?
[3:36:42] <%RioGascar> No
[3:36:43] <+MidnightBurst12> that would be horrible
[3:36:45] <%CommanderSqueaks> An internal system of balance.
[3:36:45] <Djinnazz> kinda
[3:36:46] <Doodle_Taco> Mo
[3:36:47] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> @Doodle_Taco Naruto easily
[3:36:47] <vigilant00> Only to a small degree
[3:36:48] <KaitlynnHere> @vulkan_vibes that would be cool
[3:36:48] <%heartlesshealer> KH is better than SW and Naruto consistency-wise. Even with all the soul time travel bullshit
[3:36:51] <%RioGascar> I think not really menitta
[3:36:51] <%jiggy_snipe> I've heard that theory before
[3:36:53] <%Jetzord> To become a Jedi you have to build your own lightsaber so not using that new lightsaber was a fucking mistake
[3:36:54] <Joestar1890> I don't think the Force is finite tho
[3:36:55] <T_Sasquatch> no others in the entire galaxy ???
[3:37:08] <Joestar1890> Interesting theory though
[3:37:08] <%correctedsun117> Like the force is a lake trying to spill out of a smaller and smaller hole
[3:37:13] <+oda_flobunaga> Starkiller tho?
[3:37:14] <%Irridium> but force users exist even if they're not jedi/sith
[3:37:15] <@Menitta> good because I did kinda spoil tros sorry lol
[3:37:21] <+Aeoneth> like a wierd reverse hive mind
[3:37:21] <cipher758> a little consistency never hurts. but well, it is done now. star wars mang
[3:37:23] <+craftyraichu> Aren't the sequels basically just a really bad re-imagining of the Dark Empire story line from the old EU
[3:37:24] <%subjectg> Remember that the jedi aren’t the only force users out there though
[3:37:24] <illTemperedSeaBass> The force should be the opposite. The more there are, the stronger. A reason to keep balance.
[3:37:25] <%OldManDeckardCain> then what about luke? why wasn't he OP af
[3:37:27] <+SarcFa> It's the adding all the powers to superman's arsenal
[3:37:27] <jorniev> no she is a palpatine
[3:37:30] <c3k1996> i thoght that was the idea behinde the rule of two
[3:37:30] <vigilant00> @Irridium Agreed.
[3:37:31] <%heartlesshealer> helicopter light sabers
[3:37:35] <KaitlynnHere> no she a skywalker
[3:37:35] <+aishman> HIGHLANDER
[3:37:36] <+SarcFa> because he can just do everything
[3:37:43] <Camail> you can make very strong interesting characters, but it's hard.
[3:37:46] <Heyestus> There can be only one
[3:37:47] <+oda_flobunaga> JJ is no George Lucas when it comes to writing Kappa
[3:37:47] <KaitlynnHere> she's both
[3:37:48] <%jiggy_snipe> yea Luke should have been op then
[3:37:50] <%RioGascar> the force for me will always be empire strikes back when yoda lifts the x-wing out of the swamp
[3:37:51] <Joestar1890> Kaaa chi koo
[3:37:51] <+MillerLowlife> because the script says so
[3:37:53] <%DatAsuna> Is that a symphonia reference?
[3:37:55] <KaitlynnHere> cause she murried kylo
[3:37:57] <Doodle_Taco> Kaaaachi kooo
[3:37:58] <%phatmac16> Woolie smarter than the script writers
[3:38:03] <+Freeborg1997> @craftyraichu Just episode 9
[3:38:06] <solidgoldtoast> The best explanation I've heard is that its like diving into deep water. Dark side users just dive the fuck in and get deep fast, which is why they're so strong. Light side users meditate to protect themselves and go in slowly, gaining power less quickly but not being corrupted.
[3:38:08] <%phatmac16> KAAACHI KOOKI
[3:38:10] <%NormalGuy> no it's The One with Jet Li
[3:38:10] <OverlordLuna> Acuta
[3:38:11] <KaitlynnHere> candolore
[3:38:12] <Althenias> isn't the belief that the force is a finite well an old Sith belief, what spawned the rule of 2?
[3:38:18] <%phatmac16> what
[3:38:21] <zocano> A little
[3:38:22] <Doodle_Taco> She told him where to find it didn't she?
[3:38:23] <+oda_flobunaga> Nah
[3:38:24] <%optimasmaximas> revan's a guy woolie LUL
[3:38:27] <%JeromeMci> I miss when Rey was just a nobody and that being strong in the force has nothing to do with your lineage.
[3:38:28] <Joestar1890> Mooka shaka paka
[3:38:30] <Halospaz117> I think it was in the Revan novel, which.... ehhhhhhhhh
[3:38:30] <zocano> Like a tiny bit
[3:38:38] <%CommanderSqueaks> @imsoverylazy So dark siders getting corrupted is them getting the bends?
[3:38:44] <damienlunas> Revan beats Cando up, takes his lunch money, tosses the helmet at him. "I found this shit in the garbage."
[3:38:46] <%bread_assassin> So if a Mandalorian swipes the helmet while Mandalore is in the shower, is he the new Mandalore?
[3:38:47] <KaitlynnHere> lol
[3:38:47] <Djinnazz> SO wrong
[3:38:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> One guy.
[3:38:48] <%optimasmaximas> -_-
[3:38:50] <Daxalog> In the mmo they changed Revan to be male I think
[3:38:51] <+zooeymainbtw> called out
[3:38:51] <StarkAvKnark> The old republic MMO lore playthrough when
[3:38:52] <%jiggy_snipe> One Guy lol
[3:38:52] <cipher758> jezz
[3:38:54] <%Bluemanzee> @optimasmaximas He made Revan a girl because Pockets
[3:38:54] <zocano> You learn A TINY BIT more from Candarous
[3:38:56] <%phatmac16> One guy
[3:39:02] <cipher758> one guy
[3:39:02] <%jinking79> psa1guy
[3:39:03] <%Irridium> yeah well this an't the mmo
[3:39:03] <%DatAsuna> @bread_assassin nah he also has to beat his ass
[3:39:08] <%optimasmaximas> i am psa1guy and you are wrong reeee
[3:39:08] <Joestar1890> Meetra Surik does not exist in THIS household!
[3:39:16] <jorniev> worst sequel ever 1st place still goes to Highlander
[3:39:17] <Doodle_Taco> Damn that sucks
[3:39:18] <dorpork> he has that whole subplot of gathering the mandalorians
[3:39:22] <%optimasmaximas> @Bluemanzee ah okay
[3:39:30] <ht109> cando got done dirty
[3:39:30] <%optimasmaximas> @Bluemanzee been watching this on and off thanks
[3:39:31] <Joostebrood> I mean he gets one extended sequence that's kinda nice
[3:39:33] <+SarcFa> I think Mandalore/Cando being so limited makes it seem like they wanted Dxun done last/second to last
[3:39:34] <zocano> There's a *tiny* bit extra dialogue from Candarous
[3:39:47] <308caliber> Mandalore gets some good scenes later on
[3:39:48] <%RioGascar> i get a feeling they didnt flesh out the returnint cast as much as the new cast
[3:39:50] <+oda_flobunaga> 14 months
[3:40:02] <%RioGascar> cause new cast let them do a lot of whatever they want
[3:40:03] <zocano> But ya it sucks Cando is fairly light
[3:40:08] <zocano> but he gets more play regardless
[3:40:11] <%DatAsuna> Mando gets his moments yee
[3:40:12] <%RioGascar> the old cast they have some restraints
[3:40:18] <%CommanderSqueaks> That conversation with Boa and Cando was super fucking strong tho.
[3:40:18] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:40:19] <Heyestus> Dxun/Onderon is the most heavily cut down area in the game, aside from endgame.
[3:40:26] <%Gruhunchously> I mean, T3 and HK though
[3:40:28] <Heyestus> during development, i mean
[3:40:33] <Fanciful_Unicorn> this guy has glorious hair
[3:40:40] <Joestar1890> Not a fan of that character, don't know why
[3:40:53] <%CommanderSqueaks> HK is a simple droid, with simple desires.
[3:41:00] <+oda_flobunaga> Ja who?
[3:41:05] <%CommanderSqueaks> Literally who?
[3:41:09] <ht109> who???
[3:41:10] <zocano> Ya explaining [REDACTED] is super important, V, I was surprised how interesting they were on my Female Exile playthrough
[3:41:11] <%DatAsuna> TBF you only saw half juhani's story, but also yeah
[3:41:12] <KaitlynnHere> Ja what now?
[3:41:16] <%heartlesshealer> Mission?
[3:41:17] <%jiggy_snipe> yea Mira sucks relative to what you have now
[3:41:19] <Joestar1890> I like Jolee tho
[3:41:36] <Doodle_Taco> Jolee was cool tho
[3:41:41] <%Gruhunchously> Jolee was cool
[3:41:44] <Joostebrood> [REDACTED] is a neat little bit of backstory, but just kind of an empty space of a character otherwise
[3:41:47] <Zathas> Well, other than the love interests in the first game, everyone else didn't really have that much to their characters outside of the "companion chats" in the field.
[3:41:48] <%DatAsuna> And Jolee talks about the comics a lot
[3:41:48] <zocano> That person V is talking about is actually way more interesting than I thought they would be when I did my playthrough
[3:41:52] <%emo_papi> hydromhtri subscribed with Twitch Prime.
[3:41:53] <+oda_flobunaga> Kreia is the best Star Wars character across all of Star Wars
[3:42:00] <%JeromeMci> Jolee was a taste of the themes of this game.
[3:42:03] <%RioGascar> I get a feeling the alt characters for light/dark side ones you get are less complex cause they just dont get as much attention written wise
[3:42:04] <Joestar1890> Jolee "fuck you, i'm old" Bindo
[3:42:10] <Heyestus> Canderous is arguably better in KotoR 1
[3:42:12] <zocano> @Joostebrood As a *character* yes they are absolutely not that great, but they flesh out Kreia and other things in super cool ways
[3:42:15] <Doodle_Taco> @oda_flobunaga That's correct
[3:42:22] <%DatAsuna> Bao is by far the most underrated
[3:42:25] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Livin in the swamps and smashing puh
[3:42:33] <Joestar1890> Bao is real neato
[3:42:36] <zocano> Bao-Dur is a great character
[3:42:40] <308caliber> @oda_flobunaga facts
[3:42:41] <%heartlesshealer> Bao is dope
[3:42:43] <+oda_flobunaga> Jolee "Yuo Must Gather Your Party Before Venturing Forth" Bindo
[3:42:45] <Dangerzone979> Bao-DUr is one of them "good" Iridonians
[3:42:50] <GHouseduivel> PTSD combatant FeelsBadMan
[3:43:00] <dorpork> @Heyestus canderous does nothing but reminisce over war stories in kotor1, in kotor2 he actually gets the interesting arc of reuniting the mandalorians after their defeat)
[3:43:12] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> I want Maul and Bao to just talk non stop. Their VA's are fantastic
[3:43:15] <Camail> that's rough
[3:43:21] <prince_johnny_> WOAH
[3:43:26] <GHouseduivel> Yeah mandalorians don't fuck around
[3:43:29] <%DatAsuna> Not katarr
[3:43:30] <%JeromeMci> God Damn, I didn't remember that!
[3:43:31] <Joestar1890> I want Maul in Jedi Fallen Order 2
[3:43:31] <%DatAsuna> Cathar
[3:43:34] <Dangerzone979> Cathat
[3:43:35] <%DatAsuna> yee
[3:43:36] <Halospaz117> Yeah Juhani
[3:43:38] <Joestar1890> Brutal
[3:43:39] <%heartlesshealer> yeah
[3:43:39] <Redblood801> Cathar are cat people
[3:43:41] <%DatAsuna> Cassus was a bad person
[3:43:44] <balthazarcastiglione> They're hardcore dude
[3:43:45] <zocano> Mandalore The Ultimate?
[3:43:46] <Halospaz117> Nah not Mandalore, random mando
[3:43:47] <+Freeborg1997> Yeah, that was in the comics
[3:43:48] <%Gruhunchously> Um, that's dark
[3:43:48] <%DatAsuna> No Cassus was just mandalore's best boi
[3:43:49] <vulkan_vibes> that's her masks origin? damn.
[3:43:49] <+MagicBeanBurrito> star wars has gatgirls in it
[3:43:53] <Djinnazz> Gimme that!
[3:43:59] <%Gruhunchously> No, Cathar
[3:44:01] <+MagicBeanBurrito> catgirls
[3:44:01] <Halospaz117> Wait which Mando we talking about
[3:44:07] <%ThePimpGuin> but nah, dont help them - jedai council
[3:44:09] <%DatAsuna> Cassus fett is probably dead yes
[3:44:23] <vulkan_vibes> killed in a bathtub, right?
[3:44:23] <+oda_flobunaga> Mandelore is not a name, it is a title
[3:44:23] <privatesargent> Cassus Fett wasn't Mandalore
[3:44:23] <+Kirbachev> So Revan's mask was from a rebellious Mandalorian who grew a conscious?
[3:44:24] <%DatAsuna> I don't think his wiki page would have spoils
[3:44:24] <dorpork> The mask thing is such an obvious retcon to explain why nobody recognizes your character in Kotor1.
[3:44:29] <jorniev> that mandalore is a piece of shit
[3:44:29] <KaitlynnHere> candalop
[3:44:30] <%DatAsuna> No
[3:44:31] <privatesargent> he was just a Mandalorian
[3:44:33] <zocano> Cassus Fett isn't Mandalore the Ultimate
[3:44:33] <Doodle_Taco> Candalore is a cool name
[3:44:36] <%Gruhunchously> He's in this game as well
[3:44:44] <Heyestus> Cassus Fett was poisoned in the bath because he took off his armour like a big dumb dummy.
[3:44:46] <silver__viii> Pretty sure he's just "Cassus Fett", not Mandalore at all. If he was Mandalore he would've been known by that name
[3:44:46] <%subjectg> Cassus Fett was not Mandalore, just high ranking
[3:44:49] <%DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus Rest assured I won't give you swtor stuff until you're checking out swtor
[3:44:51] <Halospaz117> @dorpork How is that a retcon?
[3:44:52] <privatesargent> i don't think Mandalore the Ultimate has a name
[3:44:54] <Joestar1890> Smuggler Campaign is so great
[3:44:58] <%perfectsalami> Its weird that Cassus Fett was a mandalorian because Jango and Boba apparently ARENT mandalorians
[3:45:12] <jorniev> comic
[3:45:17] <%subjectg> @heyestus different guy, cassus is presumed dead
[3:45:21] <dorpork> @Halospaz117 So you're telling me a Jedi Knight was dressing up like a Sith Lord and nobody bats an eye at this?
[3:45:21] <zocano> Ya Mandalore the Ultimate is just Mandalore the Ultimate
[3:45:21] <%DatAsuna> Same comics
[3:45:22] <+Freeborg1997> It's the comics
[3:45:29] <+MidnightBurst12> probably comics
[3:45:32] <%heartlesshealer> paper lore
[3:45:34] <ObsidianDragon86> Comi-oops
[3:45:36] <jorniev> zayne Carrick
[3:45:39] <+oda_flobunaga> Mandelorian is not a race... it is a vibe... an experience
[3:45:50] <+oda_flobunaga> get your M Passes here folks
[3:45:53] <ShiroOshiro> Guys my mom said that everyone can come to my birthday but when we all go bowling she can only drive 5 people to the bowling alley
[3:45:55] <Halospaz117> @dorpork He wasn't dressed as a sith, he dressed as a jedi with a mask, and also that doesn't answer my question anyways
[3:45:55] <%DatAsuna> Zayne is fun, Jarael is great, Camper is kooky
[3:46:00] <%DatAsuna> And Gryff is sketchy
[3:46:01] <+SarcFa> @perfectsalami how so? Pretty sure most stuff considered them mandos
[3:46:05] <djtonysnark616> house of x powers of ten
[3:46:05] <%DatAsuna> It's a very fun cast
[3:46:08] <Dangerzone979> IIRC as soon as you put on the mask you're Mandalore, the old you is dead
[3:46:15] <+Freeborg1997> It's issue 42 of the comics if you're interested.
[3:46:17] <zocano> Mandalorians used to be a race which is the weird part
[3:46:18] <GarbageNirvana> @shirooshiro Sounds like them other folks better find rides then huh
[3:46:20] <%DatAsuna> I did not know abou that
[3:46:23] <%DatAsuna> now I must google it
[3:46:24] <+griffball13> that was funny
[3:46:28] <lotharrio> Gog Magog?
[3:46:30] <solidgoldtoast> I understood that reference!
[3:46:31] <%JeromeMci> It only recently happened
[3:46:32] <KuroStardust> oh man
[3:46:36] <+prime_name> Check subreddit
[3:46:37] <+snackcanary> HoX /PoX is new X-Men stuff
[3:46:37] <%heartlesshealer> House of X, Powers of Ten (roman numeral X)
[3:46:38] <%GrassCannon> it was on the subreddit earlier
[3:46:43] <+gambit_gamble> Its not a marverl thing?
[3:46:45] <zocano> Mandalore the Ultimate was the last "true" Mandalorian race iirc right?
[3:46:48] <%phatmac16> It’s in the subreddit
[3:46:54] <Doodle_Taco> They have a lot of interpretations I think
[3:46:56] <lotharrio> It's a British thing. They're sleeping giants.
[3:47:01] <Joestar1890> Is that what's referenced in Kingdom Come?
[3:47:02] <%CommanderSqueaks> Guy on Twitter talked about a Persona 2 FAQ he was reading that hadn't been edited in 5 years that was edited AS HE was playing about how the editor was a born again Christian.
[3:47:17] <a_mad_dragon> gog and magog are the outsider heathens come to kill good christians
[3:47:19] <%CommanderSqueaks> It's a trip.
[3:47:19] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:47:28] <KuroStardust> Isn't Magog that dude from Kingdom Come?
[3:47:30] <dorpork> @Halospaz117 Revan's outfit absolutely looks like that of a Sith. Are you serios? So you have a guy suddenly wearing a creepy and ominous looking mask 24/7 and never ever taking it off, to the point that nobody knows what he looks like underneath it, and yet nobody is bothered or suspicious in the slightest? Do you seriously think this makes sense?
[3:47:50] <%RioGascar> Wait what
[3:47:57] <%RioGascar> avellone wrote illum
[3:48:00] <%phatmac16> A born again Christian went back to his persona 2 GameFAQ and edited it with religious nonsense
[3:48:12] <%DatAsuna> Avellone wrote media we won't specify around woolie
[3:48:16] <%RioGascar> I thought illum showed up first in clone wars
[3:48:17] <+NWannabe> Fuck naked.
[3:48:22] <%heartlesshealer> man, fuck that edit
[3:48:29] <Joestar1890> I like Solid Snake
[3:48:29] <Halospaz117> @dorpork That outfit either didn't comet il later or was just a placeholder in the actual game, the outfit he wore at least towards the start of the mandalorian wars as just a regular jedi robe with the mask. And again, you still haven't answered how it's a retcon
[3:48:34] <%krispen_wa> Revan looks like Sith only because he's the one Jedi who doesn't dress like he's in a bathrobe
[3:48:35] <%DatAsuna> @RioGascar Not that he made it, that he made the starkiller base connection
[3:48:38] <%phatmac16> Solid snake is cool
[3:48:38] <+NWannabe> But Woolie, do people love Boss more than Big Boss?
[3:48:42] <%Irridium> first time I saw Illum was SWTOR
[3:48:45] <%DatAsuna> Illum is older than TCW @RioGascar
[3:48:46] <+oda_flobunaga> Venom
[3:48:53] <%JeromeMci> For those wondering about the Persona 2 thing: https://twitter.com/GrahamSig/status/1260360673328082944?s=20
[3:48:53] <Doodle_Taco> People will love it if its good
[3:48:54] <%DatAsuna> And yes first impressions matter most
[3:48:55] <+Deano8817> Wait, first in release order or first chronologically
[3:49:00] <zocano> Ya Ilum is a SWTOR planet as well
[3:49:03] <%DatAsuna> With a bad first impression there won't be a second
[3:49:03] <Heyestus> Solid Snake > Big Boss
[3:49:06] <zocano> first time I remember seeing it
[3:49:07] <+gambit_gamble> I hate that I kinda see and agree with Pats point with Vader
[3:49:16] <%DatAsuna> I like big boss more
[3:49:18] <%RioGascar> i first watched the og trilogy so darth vader was cool
[3:49:20] <%DatAsuna> solid snake was my first.
[3:49:25] <%phatmac16> The first Mario Katy you played
[3:49:28] <%RioGascar> and also
[3:49:30] <dorpork> @Halospaz117 Its a retcon because in kotor 1 he only wore it when he became a sith
[3:49:32] <%jiggy_snipe> hmmmm
[3:49:35] <%RioGascar> THE BATTLE OF HOTH IS BURNED INTO MY MIND
[3:49:37] <%correctedsun117> I don't know, I played Pokemon from the start, but Gen 3 is best
[3:49:39] <%DatAsuna> There's a good thing about that on giant bomb called "the personal golden age of gaming"
[3:49:43] <mudapersona> No one's saying they like part 1 over any other part in jojo
[3:49:45] <%jiggy_snipe> I feel equal about Snake and Big Boss
[3:49:49] <Djinnazz> the games are better
[3:49:59] <vulkan_vibes> like I played pokemon gen 1 but I was 11 for gen 3 and that slapped
[3:49:59] <%JeromeMci> I 1st cared about star wars with the Gendi series
[3:50:01] <%DatAsuna> Which is basically what you'd expect like 13-20 is formative
[3:50:01] <cherrycottontail> Thank god I didn't have mumble rap in my teenage years
[3:50:05] <Rixstarian> It's why everyone's favorite Final Fantasy is based on generation
[3:50:07] <Hopit> I remember when I started listening to death metal at the good old age of 10
[3:50:13] <%subjectg> @dorpork how so? As far as i know the comics were the only thing to delve into the actual origins of the mask itself
[3:50:13] <solidgoldtoast> I listened to V as a teenager
[3:50:17] <%CommanderSqueaks> I used to love Three Days Grace and the Used in middle and high school, thank CTHULHU my music tastes changed.
[3:50:24] <%JeromeMci> See you all
