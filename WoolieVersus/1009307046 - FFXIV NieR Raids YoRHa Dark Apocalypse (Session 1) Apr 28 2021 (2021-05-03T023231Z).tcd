[0:18:38] <%ihavesillyknees> That's the one thing I hate about this game.
[0:18:40] <+NYCrownlessKing> make it bigger
[0:18:43] <%ihavesillyknees> The only one to be honest.
[0:18:43] <halfmasks> might wanna scale it up
[0:18:45] <@Solidus_113> you can make that box bigger
[0:18:46] <+skyheys> you can make it slightly bigger but not much
[0:18:47] <androalfus> you can make dialogue boxes bigger
[0:18:47] <+NYCrownlessKing> scale that window
[0:18:48] <penitentpendant> Sadly, no 'final cut' for this questline. Gonna be a lot of readin'

[0:19:03] <halfmasks> OH HELL NO
[0:19:04] <Zebylth> nope
[0:19:04] <%Kain5707> LUL NO
[0:19:05] <+DreyfussFrost> I play on PC with controller.
[0:19:05] <%radregice> they're pretty much equal
[0:19:05] <Johannen> Nope
[0:19:06] <%Exiliator> Yes :)
[0:19:06] <MKII> you need to right click to enbiggen text box
[0:19:06] <+caramelatte1> Yes and no
[0:19:07] <+skyheys> The controller controls better
[0:19:07] <gearcannon> no
[0:19:07] <+AugiJr> NAW
[0:19:08] <A0N33> Nope!
[0:19:09] <mr_red117> nope
[0:19:09] <RedVelvetNite> nah
[0:19:10] <%Garthunox> nope
[0:19:11] <+Masked_Hero_Lucky> Controller is just as viable as a keyboard
[0:19:11] <TigerClaws12> it's tab targetting, they're fine
[0:19:11] <+ArsCaelia> it's whatever you're used to
[0:19:12] <lucky_icarus> NOPE
[0:19:12] <DatAsuna> No
[0:19:14] <baavetti> You can make the text bigger
[0:19:14] <+MagiKestral> not at all
[0:19:15] <%ArkSeaside> no their controller support is excellent
[0:19:16] <+AugiJr> NO DIFFERENCE
[0:19:16] <Riorii> Its developed REALLY well for controller
[0:19:17] <sirtommygunn> its different
[0:19:18] <MemMoor> pat is using controller on pc
[0:19:18] <@mothmandraws> controler probably get better movement, but targeting easier on msbk
[0:19:20] <ArthurDoyleRPG> No
[0:19:20] <DatAsuna> Explain clickers to him
[0:19:20] <+FroggoPrince> There's minor differences, but it's reliant on your comfort
[0:19:20] <+JustBlubs> No. The game is made with controllers in mind. It's preference as long as you set everything up right.
[0:19:21] <+Hollow_Mirage> Nope PS4 controller better
[0:19:22] <%AlteisenReiseZ> NO DIFFERENCE
[0:19:22] <%ShinobiPhoenix> you can also use a keyboard and mouse on PS5 too
[0:19:25] <+AugiJr> Controller Support is the GOLD STANDARD
[0:19:27] <Man_in_the_Red> its only really better for healing
[0:19:28] <sirtommygunn> different but neither is strictly better
[0:19:29] <quietshun> I prefer controller
[0:19:31] <@Solidus_113> it's a 2.5 second cooldown
[0:19:31] <+ArsCaelia> i like keyboard more but controller works fine
[0:19:31] <%radregice> though if you're most used to mk+b controller might take some time to adjust
[0:19:32] <Louie_Salmon> Controller is arguably much better
[0:19:33] <+eanscrale> It's not like an FPS because the controller support is VERY good
[0:19:34] <%TomAtlus> The controller support in XIV is absurdly amazing
[0:19:34] <+D00msDayDan> i guess woolie forgot all the times pat explained how good this game plays on controller and that's the reason he got so big into it
[0:19:35] <OmegaTrigun> they have good controller support here
[0:19:36] <TheYellowcouch> Controllers real good
[0:19:36] <+Hollow_Mirage> Controller is 100% Better
[0:19:36] <%Garthunox> nope wrong
[0:19:36] <+captainplanet88> its all preference
[0:19:36] <Daniel_Is_I> Controller support is really good
[0:19:37] <RocketBarrel> I prefer controller
[0:19:38] <demiiluna> It's the difference between playing on pad and playing on stick. Which is to say it doesn't matter at the ceiling but it does matter at the floor.
[0:19:38] <Man_in_the_Red> but even then, not by much
[0:19:38] <+skyheys> Pat literally explained that to him LUL
[0:19:39] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I have a keyboard plugged into my PS5 right now
[0:19:40] <%ArkSeaside> Macro-ing is unreliable
[0:19:40] <%dios_happy_hour> buttons are same, camera issues are normal cmaera stuff
[0:19:40] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:19:40] <%ihavesillyknees> I love playing with a controller
[0:19:40] <maddogshimano> someone tell woolie and minh to press R3 to make the text boxes bigger
[0:19:41] <+Someitalian123> Holy shit, your playing ff14, does pat know?
[0:19:42] <MKII> top ranked raiders play on controller too so it's fine
[0:19:43] <+dom3800> Controller isn't a handicap, but it's not better
[0:19:44] <DatAsuna> 2.5 is actually a pretty long GCD
[0:19:47] <zecht89> KB+Mouse is better, but not by a lot.
[0:19:47] <%Daskolin> I prefer controller to keyboard and mouse
[0:19:51] <%ihavesillyknees> I hate to have to talk.
[0:19:55] <%optimasmaximas> @someitalian123 pat is in game
[0:19:57] <%ihavesillyknees> But playing is great
[0:19:58] <+The_RDDM> Strong controller support, but I personally like to use mouse and keyboard.
[0:19:59] <Man_in_the_Red> @someitalian123 he's stalking them along with us :)
[0:19:59] <%czeekytv> Controller support in FFXIV id godlike, it has spoiled me on every other MMO
[0:20:03] <OkamiDude15> Story time with woolie
[0:20:05] <+KawaiiJetty> it is just preference
[0:20:07] <Nordguy> 2.5 + off GCD weaves
[0:20:12] <halfmasks> Remove one of the chats, incease text box size
[0:20:12] <+Masked_Hero_Lucky> There should be a setting in UI to make everything the same size
[0:20:16] <Riorii> i will always prefer m&k tho, like the controll over CDs
[0:20:24] <+QueequegTheater> 4K baybee
[0:20:25] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it's not even a good keyboard, it's an old Dell keyboard
[0:20:30] <TigerClaws12> you were there, UI size
[0:20:30] <+skyheys> game has SO MANY settings
[0:20:31] <Nordguy> dudes be tripleweaving shit for fun

[0:20:40] <+skyheys> nope
[0:20:41] <%Juriasu> SourPls
[0:20:42] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Sort of
[0:20:42] <+ArsCaelia> nope that's a big reveal
[0:20:44] <+Arnschen> Not really
[0:20:44] <%BestTeaMaker> YEAH THE MUSIC
[0:20:44] <%Garthunox> nope
[0:20:47] <+wunp_fxs> ff14 is ff disneyland
[0:20:48] <TheAntitype> that music LOL
[0:20:49] <%Pigg1yJuffs> Well, I shall be here in spirit, seeing as I'm gonna play alongside the stream.
[0:20:49] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> hahaha, I remember when he used this mount music for the Death Stranding LP
[0:20:50] <Solidnick18> LUL
[0:20:51] <brachydios777> CHUNKABO
[0:20:53] <+mechslayer71> Monhun
[0:20:55] <%Chichen> ivalice raids are canon in bozja
[0:20:55] <halfmasks> this is such a stupid image right now
[0:20:55] <Louie_Salmon> Well this is the first, we're not in the source currently
[0:20:56] <42nfl19> So just a TRAIN of people will follow Minh lol
[0:20:57] <mr_red117> the tactics stuff is baked ijn
[0:20:58] <+BlueEyesWhiteFatass> its LITERALLY canon
[0:20:58] <%ihavesillyknees> Is it Canon?
[0:20:58] <+NYCrownlessKing> the bad guys are trying to attack the other worlds because their catastrophes effect the main world @woolieversus
[0:20:59] <TigerClaws12> Pat lied? no way D:
[0:21:00] <+JustBlubs> FFXV is the only straight up "Fall into the XIV world" event
[0:21:00] <vllabs> catJam
[0:21:01] <diegobandzz> We playing gg now boys
[0:21:02] <Ethrion> it's just more content for the stuff you like
[0:21:03] <DatAsuna> Canon isn't about your opinion
[0:21:06] <+Graxe_> The Ivalice in FF14 is not the Ivalice of FFT
[0:21:07] <+ArsCaelia> ivalice is straight up just a place on hydalaen
[0:21:08] <+gespenst25> the tie-in events aren't canon, the Tactics stuff is just that the exact same things happened on this world but that's a special case
[0:21:08] <+ApocalypticExpress> was hoping woolie would actually start playing so I can help out to progress but this is a gud alternative
[0:21:10] <+skyheys> they're usually like ONE QUEST or it's an alt reality thibg
[0:21:10] <+angry_boy> Is he doing this for the nier quests?
[0:21:12] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Pat is very wrong about the Ivalica raids being FFT-canon
[0:21:12] <%Skullgod> it's canon
[0:21:14] <+JustBlubs> Everything else is mixed into the game's canon
[0:21:15] <Psyramics> wait, whose account is this?
[0:21:15] <Nordguy> NieR is 100 percent real
[0:21:15] <+MostRefinedCalla> Is this the fat chocobo from the KFC IRL quest?
[0:21:15] <ArkSeaside> Pat is shit at explaining those things lol
[0:21:16] <%elbigante> Some of them are canon as "FFXIV versions" of lore but noctis car is just non-canon easter egg stuf
[0:21:18] <+Williamld> Ivalice is like an alternate ending
[0:21:18] <+ActiveLink> The Tactics stuff is alternate universe type stuff
[0:21:18] <Goraka91> It's like a mirror universe Ivalice
[0:21:19] <TheAntitype> They're canon but the Ivalice content is like an alternate universe with similar characters.
[0:21:19] <%Garthunox> Ivalice is an in game location thats basically a ruined kingdom
[0:21:20] <powerprotoman> its super canon
[0:21:22] <+captainplanet88> ivalice is canon
[0:21:22] <zecht89> Taro's stuff is always canon
[0:21:25] <+Tobatcie> I mean, Ivalice is a part of the main story of the game
[0:21:25] <Safarihat> everything is canon in nier
[0:21:26] <%ShinobiPhoenix> yoko taro made it clear it's canon
[0:21:27] <%Juriasu> how do you even define canonicity when it comes to nier
[0:21:27] <%Major_Lee_> Canon until said otherwise
[0:21:29] <+caramelatte1> Its 'kinda' non-canon
[0:21:30] <pelonsinvalle> can I watch this if I don't know drakengard?
[0:21:30] <+terry_quest> ivalice is canon to 14
[0:21:30] <jackythefrost> ivalice is hard canon
[0:21:32] <%ihavesillyknees> If this Nier raid is canon and important, then Yoko Taro is a jerk
[0:21:33] <+Jakeofalco> go get glasses
[0:21:36] <+dom3800> Taro straight up said Nier is canon
[0:21:36] <brachydios777> It’s canon
[0:21:38] <%radregice> nier raid content is absolutely canon
[0:21:39] <sendart> Nier is 100% canon
[0:21:41] <+michelangelo_c> Didn't yokotaro say it's canon?
[0:21:41] <RedVelvetNite> its canon
[0:21:42] <%Exiliator> wha?
[0:21:42] <+QueequegTheater> Ivalice is canon to 14 but not canon to FFT
[0:21:43] <Zeif00> Its BIG CANON
[0:21:44] <+cubbywolf> is this the mirror world?
[0:21:44] <exnuart> 2p is canon and shes from soul calibur
[0:21:45] <rufus2k2> HELLO?!
[0:21:46] <+LuckyHitman> Its canon to Nier universe
[0:21:46] <+ArsCaelia> raid content is always canon
[0:21:46] <%Garthunox> nier is 100% canon
[0:21:51] <+SinisterBroccoli> who cares if it's canon or not
[0:21:53] <halfmasks> @JakeOfalco the tv is like 10 feet away, its actually pretty hard
[0:21:55] <Zeif00> Confirmed Canon
[0:21:55] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> yoko tari said its canon minh lol
[0:22:01] <jackythefrost> taro openly said its canon
[0:22:02] <Edajos> !uptime
[0:22:02] <MKII> there you go
[0:22:02] <heartlesshealer> Canon to Yoko Taro worlds
[0:22:02] <@Moobot> @Edajos WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 31 minutes and 48 seconds
[0:22:02] <rufus2k2> oh Minh, PHEW!
[0:22:03] <+JustBlubs> Nier is canon but because you're in some other world what's it matter in the long run right?
[0:22:04] <+QueequegTheater> BIG
[0:22:04] <+mikesapartment> perfect
[0:22:05] <+wunp_fxs> oh geezus
[0:22:05] <+Sharmanyx> Need 2p Kappa
[0:22:05] <@mothmandraws> it me
[0:22:06] <+Arnschen> Iirc, it was sait to be canon when accounced
[0:22:06] <TheYellowcouch> I so respects pats commitment to always being on screen but not on stream lmao
[0:22:07] <rysku> beeeeeg
[0:22:07] <SomersaultJustice> WHAT IS THIS
[0:22:08] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Ivalice isn't canon to old tactics, but it is to 12
[0:22:09] <DedlokPM> @MostRefinedCalla no the KFC one is a Black Chocobo. It was also the one that Amazon promo
[0:22:11] <+Caidezes> Yoko Taro is not canon.
[0:22:12] <%ihavesillyknees> Perfect
[0:22:15] <%jinking79> it take one sentence to make something canon or non
[0:22:17] <halfmasks> perfect
[0:22:18] <+Nexoosen> Nier in ffxiv is canon to nier, it is unclear as to whether or not it is canon to ffxiv
[0:22:19] <+QueequegTheater> Fucken Cerberus mount
[0:22:19] <+ApocalypticExpress> both Ivalice and NieR are canon according to their respective scenario writers so
[0:22:21] <zecht89> @ihavesillyknees It's always canon but honestly, the only take away from this is that the Queen Beast digitized itself and now can merge with itself from other timelines
[0:22:21] <exnuart> that cerberus
[0:22:22] <%KillianST> Werylt is pure woolie content
[0:22:25] <+ArsCaelia> ur mum not canon lolololol
[0:22:29] <halfmasks> cerberus spin
[0:22:30] <kozboz96> @mothmandraws you got the frog outfit to shit post?
[0:22:37] <Goraka91> @exnuart Imagine not only making a 2P colour canon but making a raid in a third game about her
[0:22:38] <rufus2k2> what is that flying machine

[0:38:03] <tdude0175> I expected to see the intro that I have seen 10 other times. You are good woolie

[0:38:13] <+wunp_fxs> not really
[0:38:14] <%Double_Tap_That> No, because you'll lack context
[0:38:14] <%TomAtlus> No
[0:38:15] <jaysondeez> you want to introduce
[0:38:16] <JanusII> You need the character backstory.
[0:38:17] <SomersaultJustice> no woolie, you need to learn the LORE
[0:38:20] <jaysondeez> but this is the BEGINNING of it
[0:38:21] <mr_red117> no, you need to know Anogg and Konogg
[0:38:21] <Riorii> youll understand
[0:38:22] <%Garthunox> could you start Automata at Ending B?
[0:38:25] <+QueequegTheater> Oh good we're all blind
[0:38:28] <TEAMATTACK13> this is perfect music for shenanigans
[0:38:28] <+jerkhov_> Yoko Taro still wrote the dwarf stuff
[0:38:33] <+Ilpala> Android Ass will arrive soon enough
[0:38:34] <HollowMan190> this music
[0:38:34] <PhilanthropyG> Yoko Taro is a subtle magician. Gotta keep it slow and open
[0:38:35] <Goraka91> The dwarves are the framing device
[0:38:35] <JanusII> Like you don't need the whole FFXIV backstory but you need the twins.
[0:38:38] <%fetrigon> LOOOOOORRRRREEEE PunOko PunOko PunOko PunOko
[0:38:39] <crocboyz> you have to love the twins
[0:38:39] <+caramelatte1> Twins are pretty important lol
[0:38:40] <SomersaultJustice> you don't start nier at ending b after all
[0:38:40] <+QueequegTheater> LEARN ABOUT THE TINY BABY PEOPLE, WOOLIE
[0:38:40] <+panlakes> this music is inside woolies head right now
[0:38:43] <+ApocalypticExpress> Why couldn't Automata start at ending B?
[0:38:43] <+RushUnplugged> can you start a movie from half time? yes, but then don't start asking who the characters are
[0:38:43] <vVAstrAVv> ive never seen you LESS thankful woolie
[0:38:44] <DatAsuna> the music really is a lot
[0:38:44] <+UKOrigin> guys the dwarves dialogue is RELEVANT
[0:38:45] <+skyheys> "I w
[0:38:46] <Johannen> Woolie is Ok with starting from the sequel
[0:38:47] <+consistentlylistless> How long until Woolie gives up and just watches Pat's stream archive live

[0:38:52] <+Blackmage9999> Mad because Small
[0:38:53] <Ethrion> BALMUNG
[0:38:54] <Louie_Salmon> Woolie you're literally about to listen to like hundreds of more lines of dialogue about these dwarves
[0:38:54] <+ApocalypticExpress> Shoulda just put us there
[0:38:54] <%radregice> go to balmung right the fuck now
[0:38:55] <@mothmandraws> I WILL

[0:38:57] <Allenou> Have you heard the tale of Lord Potato Potato the wise ?
[0:38:57] <aiutare47> It really is always twins isn’t it?
[0:38:58] <+wunp_fxs> hes not a degenerate
[0:38:59] <%TomAtlus> People don't approach unless you have a fuckin rp tag up anyway
[0:39:00] <%ShinobiPhoenix> You have to eat your meat and potatoes
[0:39:00] <@mothmandraws> LETS GO RP RUN
[0:39:02] <exnuart> all the roleplay is in uldah
[0:39:02] <%dios_happy_hour> RPers are marked for the world to see
[0:39:04] <dds333a> Can you fucking imagine
[0:39:04] <TEAMATTACK13> woolie wants the Neir content where he hasn't even finished the Automata content
[0:39:06] <+axenred> All of Crystal is RP, but Balmung moreso
[0:39:08] <LittleWulfie> Every server is a roleplay server if you're thirsty enough
[0:39:10] <BluBox> Woolie visits BALMUNG
[0:39:12] <+DruSM157> It's not the degen RP server, it's the BEST SERVER ON PRIMAL BAYBEEEEEE
[0:39:14] <+allups> RP servers are the life blood of some games
[0:39:17] <TheYellowcouch> Woolie VS Crystal
[0:39:17] <bestwaifuritsu> Ultros is the only sane server.
[0:39:17] <+JustBlubs> Gotta RP walk through the Nier raid
[0:39:18] <%Exiliator> Plot twist, there never was a Nier raid. This is all just a big setup to make Woolie watch a bunch of FFXIV
[0:39:19] <+QueequegTheater> All the filthy RPers are in Limsa
[0:39:20] <%JivetheSuperTurkey> JivetheSuperTurkey subscribed with Prime.
[0:39:20] <prime_name> Syrina is killing it
[0:39:20] <%KetsuoTaberu> That was a queue for everyone playing to only roleplay when talking to woolie
[0:39:22] <+jerkhov_> Primal is mixed
[0:39:24] <donutlynx> Balmung is the rp server
[0:39:24] <%juiceboxhero116> Balmung or Bust!
[0:39:25] <roseshrimp> ULTROS BEST SERVER IN DA WORLD bayybeeee
[0:39:27] <Riorii> ive turned off mount music for so long i forgot it even was a thing

[0:39:36] <TheAntitype> woolie visits the quicksand on balmung
[0:39:36] <aiutare47> @allups Only way SS13 is still kicking
[0:39:38] <dds333a> @exiliator Kappa
[0:39:44] <Allenou> It's because they're pussies !
[0:39:50] <%radregice> crystal apart from balmung is alright but relatively low pop
[0:39:50] <HNo4ce> LUL
[0:39:51] <jaysondeez> some people would argue otherwise
[0:39:51] <DaKnightWarrior> LUL
[0:39:52] <+DruSM157> Ultros for life
[0:39:52] <exnuart> @skyheys woolie just wants to react to the boss fights

[0:39:53] <%TomAtlus> That doesn't happen nearly as much later :V

[0:40:02] <%SirGO0SE> woolieSPICE
[0:40:03] <%ggbhtg> The Anti-Woolz
[0:40:04] <+caramelatte1> Funnily enough its the nier content that reverts to ARR style quests
[0:40:04] <funkerbuster> this is arr with the slow buildup all over again
[0:40:04] <+JustBlubs> I mean if the Warrior of Light can't get the soap scum off who could?
[0:40:05] <+gespenst25> Good grief.
[0:40:05] <%ArkSeaside> Minh I feel you're misrepresenting the game in its current state
[0:40:07] <LanceDavidson> LUL
[0:40:07] <+QueequegTheater> THAT'S WHY WE'RE WATCHING
[0:40:07] <Zeif00> Anti-hyping the game huh

[0:40:10] <%JustYudha> LUL LUL LUL
[0:40:10] <Solidnick18> fetch quest stuff
[0:40:15] <%KetsuoTaberu> lmao
[0:40:15] <+bladeworksmaster> the Warrior of Light legitimately develops a Pavlovian response to the word "fetch" in the Return to Ivalice series
[0:40:15] <XrosHawk> At least it all plays into the Dark Knight job story line
[0:40:16] <%TomAtlus> That's a G R O S S misrepresentation Minh
[0:40:16] <%fetrigon> LUL LUL LUL
[0:40:16] <reonome> i feel you woolie
[0:40:17] <%Zombino924> "My boner goes into my body"

[0:40:18] <DatAsuna> We couldn't tell :P
[0:40:20] <%Jaxnos> you should get that checked out if your boner goes in
[0:40:21] <+678saintglock> the music makes it even better
[0:40:21] <Johannen> Get those veggies outa here says Woolie...MORE MEAT
[0:40:22] <dds333a> I don't mind it, at least not always
[0:40:24] <%emperordread> Expediency is Woolie's true kryptonite
[0:40:25] <2DSuperiority> Boondocks READ dot gif
[0:40:26] <%JivetheSuperTurkey> I'm so hype to see woolies thoughts on the raids
[0:40:26] <+UKOrigin> minh is really underselling this, does he just skip cutscenes.. wtf
[0:40:26] <%nabby1> :)
[0:40:27] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Woolie your boner will rip back out in the actual raid
[0:40:27] <PhilanthropyG> oof. Woolie is soft as rope right now
[0:40:27] <T_Sasquatch> its worth it
[0:40:29] <+zaitje> The bills ain't paying them selfs Woolie Kappa
[0:40:30] <%LouieRouie> Haul some manure for me
[0:40:30] <%baronblank> Minh actively trying to dissuade Woolie from playing 14 LUL
[0:40:31] <+UnderseaMagic> most ffxiv non combat content is boring as hell
[0:40:32] <penitentpendant> Power through those vegetables for that MEAT
[0:40:33] <Floofiie> @TomAtlus my man
[0:40:33] <T_Sasquatch> ITS WORTH ITTTTT
[0:40:34] <RyuuAoi> WOAH! WTF is Woolie playin' RN?!?!
[0:40:38] <+PlaneWalkerDavid> Don't play NieR Replicant then
[0:40:40] <+rando_0268> tTo be fair the nier quest takes a little too long to get going
[0:40:40] <42nfl19> ETA till @WoolieVersus just slumps back
[0:40:42] <TheYellowcouch> I bet some Emet cutscenes could sell him
[0:40:42] <Zeif00> the sandbag
[0:40:43] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:40:44] <+bladeworksmaster> you can tell one of the quest givers "Tell me to fetch one more time motherfucker"
[0:40:46] <Equirah> get him into crafting, that'll hook him in LUL
[0:40:49] <Parapattern> "No Take! Only Throw!"
[0:40:50] <HollowMan190> sure it is
[0:40:57] <donutlynx> If you like nier you may or may not like this raid series
[0:40:58] <bestwaifuritsu> "I tire of this charade of fetch quests"
[0:41:03] <+JustBlubs> If you aren't invested in the story or world this stuff in between the combat has literally nothing for you sadly
[0:41:04] <donutlynx> No spoilers LUL
[0:41:04] <+QueequegTheater> @RyuuAoi Minh is showing Woolie why he will never choose to play FFXIV
[0:41:08] <dds333a> Videogames
[0:41:08] <%Double_Tap_That> Remember that Yoko Taro wrote the whole scenario, including the dwarf stuff, so it's just as relevant thematically.
[0:41:09] <+allups> this music and this gameplay is killing me
[0:41:09] <+DakotaMacDoodle> Woolie will (NOT) figure it out
[0:41:13] <+VGGary> delicate dwarven damsel
[0:41:13] <+allups> i love it
[0:41:16] <linSP> if you don’t like these quests you might not like nier
[0:41:18] <DSD24> Look how Tiny Minh's character is
[0:41:21] <%TomAtlus> Woolie will (Never) figure it ou
[0:41:22] <%megadblitz> the neir LUST is keeping woolie alive
[0:41:22] <Irb11> The encounters are fun
[0:41:23] <funkerbuster> imagine if there was no flying NotLikeThis
[0:41:28] <DatAsuna> in wow, yes
[0:41:29] <%Chichen> XIV is more story heavy
[0:41:30] <exnuart> wow is just raids
[0:41:30] <Tisaric> There is once you get through all this BS
[0:41:31] <+wunp_fxs> thats endgame
[0:41:32] <+VGGary> thats how endgame is
[0:41:32] <Daniel_Is_I> That's every tuesday
[0:41:34] <+QueequegTheater> There is but FFXIV is big story
[0:41:35] <exnuart> 14 has a story
[0:41:36] <Iwashi94> that is how it works?
[0:41:36] <Explodincatz> thats endgame MMO
[0:41:37] <nobody287> yeah just the raids
[0:41:37] <JanusII> That's after these quests.
[0:41:38] <%ArkSeaside> how dare this nier content have moments of low paced tedium
[0:41:38] <aiutare47> There kinda is in WoW
[0:41:40] <dds333a> Do it again
[0:41:41] <jaysondeez> thats like end game when you've done everything else
[0:41:41] <%czeekytv> this is literally that woolie. it just takes more time than you expceted
[0:41:41] <+Masked_Hero_Lucky> FFXIV actually has a plot that revolves around the player
[0:41:42] <samuraicaveman> that happens after you've done it ones and repeate it
[0:41:42] <Riorii> ff14 content is always locked behind quests
[0:41:44] <Tisaric> but yeah that's endgame
[0:41:46] <sendart> get 10 rocks and 20 flowers
[0:41:49] <Goraka91> 14 is big story
[0:41:50] <+Metballs> That's like weekly/ex/savage
[0:41:50] <DatAsuna> That's when you have the quests on farm mode, not story runs
[0:41:51] <%Garthunox> that is how it works here, but it has a story attached

[0:47:11] <RyuuAoi> @patstaresat he's wrong about everything isn't he?
[0:47:12] <%SSaryn> I legitimately appreciate Woolie actually taking time to even try.
[0:47:12] <Louie_Salmon> Woolie that's literally the game
[0:47:13] <+GalacticaPhanto> This was a ruse it's time for TEA
[0:47:13] <+WubGhost> wait what
[0:47:15] <%ggbhtg> WE GOT THEM CLIFFNOTES
[0:47:16] <%PatStaresAt> wow he doesn't know what he's talking about

[0:47:22] <%Juriasu> LUL
[0:47:23] <%SirGO0SE> @WoolieVersus you looked up the combo trials without going through the tutorial
[0:47:23] <jaysondeez> read the visual language
[0:47:25] <KuroStardust> LMAO
[0:47:26] <+JustBlubs> Woolie's already better than part of the playerbase
[0:47:26] <%czeekytv> "people play this FOR A GOOD REASON???!??? wow never would've guessed"
[0:47:27] <+Mendin> @PatStaresAt Speaking from experience?
[0:47:28] <EL_TRO> lets go The Alexander Ultimate
[0:47:29] <dds333a> Even if it was a free for all, it's still pretty fun
[0:47:30] <RyuuAoi> Lol Pat
[0:47:32] <%Double_Tap_That> FFXIV is very position heavy
[0:47:33] <+StonefireXIV> AIGHT SHOW HIM LIGHTS RAMPANT
[0:47:34] <+Jiggisnipe> talk about in fighting game terms
[0:47:36] <IamGrapes> Woolie would never get past ARR just give up hope on that
[0:47:37] <bestwaifuritsu> he's FIGURING IT OUT
[0:47:39] <StencilOST> Turns out FFXIV is fighting games
[0:47:39] <iacus_> i hate they they acll them mechanics
[0:47:40] <+bladeworksmaster> Alright MMO, I see you.
[0:47:40] <Equirah> they're still mechanics in other games LUL
[0:47:41] <%ArkSeaside> and you call your combos rotations
[0:47:41] <+QueequegTheater> I'm a tank, I just eat those mechanics
[0:47:42] <Irb11> Honestly I thought we were going to come into this and just knock out the encounters and say ggs, didn't expect him to do the whole questline
[0:47:42] <Louie_Salmon> Pat has brought this up on the podcast like 500 times
[0:47:43] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:47:44] <dds333a> But yeah, these guys have mechanics, multi step shit
[0:47:44] <DatAsuna> mechanics are also sometimes literal puzzles
[0:47:44] <+UKOrigin> @PatStaresAt its super bullshit they are just skipping all the dialogue, itll ruin stuff later on v-v
[0:47:46] <+Arnschen> Now memorise all of them, Woolie
[0:47:49] <%ArkSeaside> but woolie hates tthe word rotation
[0:47:50] <twoto858> Yeah pretty much
[0:47:52] <+Arnschen> Avoid the gaze
[0:47:55] <jaysondeez> yup skip past that lol
[0:47:56] <+GalacticaPhanto> E11S Prog lessgooo
[0:47:56] <+QueequegTheater> @Louie_Salmon that implies Woolie listens to Pat
[0:47:56] <Goraka91> PogChamp Smarter than half the playerbase
[0:47:58] <dauver> close your heart to it
[0:47:58] <Daniel_Is_I> Woolie already knows more than pubs
[0:47:58] <Louie_Salmon> Like this has been said to Woolie for literal years
[0:47:59] <ArthurDoyleRPG> Mechanics are for cars Kappa
[0:47:59] <+VGGary> there were robots on that quest image PogChamp
[0:47:59] <Riorii> yea you just have to go with it sometimes
[0:48:00] <jaysondeez> actually for the best
[0:48:01] <TheAntitype> woolie understands mechanics better than most players
[0:48:01] <Zeif00> Most of it's SUPER OBVIOUS where you need to go
[0:48:02] <@mothmandraws> @WoolieVersus minh ask woolie to tell you what to do in raid, see if he can solve the mechanics
[0:48:03] <ULT_13> the drawves are vital
[0:48:05] <+bladeworksmaster> FFXIV actually fucking TELLS YOU WHAT THE ATTACKS DO
[0:48:06] <Johannen> Woolie does not care for writing, he is here for the ASS
[0:48:06] <vVAstrAVv> imagine a streamer reading notes instead of just playing to see why its good
[0:48:09] <Nordguy> yoooo hang on, you can have multiple chat windows??
[0:48:10] <BluBox> Why does Woolie know more than the average player?
[0:48:11] <+DenpaDev> It's basically red light green light
[0:48:11] <%SSaryn> Holy fuck he's actually being more smart than 75% of all XIV players.
[0:48:13] <%czeekytv> imagine liking Nier games and hating dialogue, like wtf
[0:48:15] <%JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> skip arr embrace hw
[0:48:17] <%LittleCinders> @woolieversus When do we get Woolie vs A Realm Reborn PT. 1?
[0:48:17] <+bladeworksmaster> you want to know why WoW fell off, it's partly because of that
[0:48:19] <RyuuAoi> Yup. Right, Woolie...
[0:48:20] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Wait, is Pat in the game just watching?
[0:48:24] <+bladeworksmaster> it doesn't tell you jack shit about any big attacks
[0:48:25] <tomdwarf> Yes. Woolie. you have the general idea. Dont take shit!
[0:48:25] <%TomAtlus> Mmhm, yeah, sure...
[0:48:25] <funkerbuster> follow the herd so we might live or die together Kappa
[0:48:26] <%ggbhtg> WE GOT THEM CLIFFNOTES, FUCK YOU CHAT
[0:48:27] <+QueequegTheater> "GUYS I TOTALLY DON'T ZONE OUT WHEN PAT TALKS FFXIV ON THE PODCAST AND HE ALREADY EXPLAINED THIS" Kappa
[0:48:29] <%Garthunox> ahhhhhhhh
[0:48:30] <@Solidus_113> This is album of markers I sent him https://imgur.com/a/c9oxF1d
[0:48:34] <MKII> and sometimes the boss makes you do MATH
[0:48:35] <+dasmause> woolie right now is me listening to fighting game talk on the podcast
[0:48:38] <+rando_0268> you learn it over 80 levels slowly
[0:48:40] <@mothmandraws> and savage makes half of them invisible
[0:48:43] <LittleWulfie> Woolie now knows more about FFXIV mechanics than 80% of the playerbase
[0:48:43] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> to be fair the learning is gradual
[0:48:43] <+GalacticaPhanto> @patstaresat doing his best Myers impersonation
[0:48:45] <+VGGary> ITS TIME PogChamp
[0:48:46] <DatAsuna> Yeah MMOs rely heavily on iconography like that. Think of it like MGR eye flashes or batman head sparks
[0:48:47] <%p4ntless> shit really gets nutty when you have multiples of those layered on top of each other
[0:48:47] <Johannen> @czeekytv Woolie actually skipped all the dialogue and just treated it as an action game
[0:48:47] <TheYellowcouch> Wow I'm glad he actually took it serious
[0:48:51] <%Dapper_Cactuar> Dapper_Cactuar subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! NIER TIME
[0:48:54] <jackythefrost> @jonwholovesflatwomen you wont understand what the fuck is happening in HW if you skip ARR

[1:15:46] <RinWR> @Timarkot You wait for someone with a resurrection spell to raise you
[1:15:47] <UnsteadyFunk> Woolie already better than some PUGs lol
[1:15:47] <SomersaultJustice> ONE OF US

[1:15:53] <%d1stantutopia> @Timarkot you wait to get raised, or if it's clear the attempt is bust you reset to the beginning of the area
[1:15:59] <funkerbuster> Im proud of you woolz BibleThump
[1:16:01] <@Solidus_113> 2400 mana
[1:16:06] <penitentpendant> 2400 mana
[1:16:08] <+QueequegTheater> 1/4 of your MP
[1:16:11] <%Kain5707> @Timarkot you can be revived but you get a weakness buff for a certain amount of time
[1:16:13] <DeltaD36> 2400
[1:16:14] <+caramelatte1> About 1/4
[1:16:15] <BluBox> Woolie is among the top 75% players without even playing
[1:16:16] <Nordguy> a quarter of your mana
[1:16:17] <+OblivionSword1> and a longg cooldown
[1:16:18] <penitentpendant> Out of 10,000
[1:16:19] <JanusII> 24% of your MP.
[1:16:19] <+ApocalypticExpress> 2400
[1:16:19] <illusbal> the worst part is swiftcast cooldown
[1:16:19] <+mikesapartment> 25% healer MP
[1:16:20] <mr_red117> lot of MP, long cast time\
[1:16:22] <@mothmandraws> you can 8 man this raid series lol
[1:16:23] <Pt_Kamen> 10$
[1:16:24] <EL_TRO> wekness also
[1:16:26] <%dios_happy_hour> 2400/10000
[1:16:30] <T_Sasquatch> Lb3 baby
[1:16:30] <GarbageNirvana> Most of it really is the cast time/cooldown
[1:16:37] <+Mendin> 2400 and an 8ish second cast time
[1:16:40] <funkerbuster> waste the quixkcast on the rez
[1:16:48] <tuesti> but WHM can use a buff to ignore MP cost which is litty
[1:16:48] <%ggbhtg> 2P spinning and winning over there
[1:16:50] <SomersaultJustice> wonder if they'll get an lb3 this run
[1:16:55] <+QueequegTheater> RDM LB3 DO IT BLIND US
[1:16:55] <%Kain5707> debuff* not buff
[1:17:01] <Louie_Salmon> Slay the Spire is super cool for that reason
[1:17:02] <Haarute> healer's gotta work
[1:17:08] <UnsteadyFunk> Minh does exactly what I do and just spams Geirskogul when Nastrond is about to come up lol
[1:17:08] <SomersaultJustice> just be perfect 4Head
[1:17:09] <DSD24> Unavoidable Damage
[1:17:09] <Ethrion> flawless is a team effort here
[1:17:14] <Kadraxan> JUST DON'T GET HIT LOL
[1:17:18] <%ArkSeaside> I mean, JRPGs can't go damage free
[1:17:19] <+Mendin> The non-guarenteed damage you REALLY want to dodge though
[1:17:20] <%TomAtlus> Dark Knight can parry shit too technically
[1:17:20] <+bladeworksmaster> sometimes you have to only do Just Well Enough in fights
[1:17:28] <@Solidus_113> they're called tethers
[1:17:32] <+bladeworksmaster> lookin' at you Suzaku
[1:17:33] <%HollowedIdjit> All of the Tanks have something to just shrug damage
[1:17:34] <penitentpendant> Them Kamikaze Tethers
[1:17:38] <robo_badger> Blackest Night is best skill
[1:17:40] <%HollowedIdjit> Except Warrior. Warrior just heals through the pain.
[1:17:44] <+runegod20> You will take hits, just take the least amount as possible
[1:17:46] <TheYellowcouch> Tell him about the royalguard lol
[1:17:51] <+seoliart> The Blackest Night is pog
[1:17:59] <%HollowedIdjit> TBN is so good dude
[1:18:13] <GarbageNirvana> You think Woolie would be able to handle Superbolide
[1:18:14] <+QueequegTheater> Blackest Night doesn't make up for Delirium becoming shit though
[1:18:15] <@Solidus_113> 2 months to learn how the 10 minutes work
[1:18:16] <+Leftovermemes> i thought woolie was playing ffxiv for a sec and had a heart attack
[1:18:16] <+Alaster101> how many viewers does woolie average? this feels like the most ive seen him have
[1:18:17] <SomersaultJustice> se.1 LB
[1:18:19] <exnuart> its a dance
[1:18:23] <%d1stantutopia> TBN is the GOAT, BLK represent
[1:18:24] <%ArkSeaside> TBN best defensive cooldown, I don't even care that DRK gets the worst Invuln
[1:18:25] <+Leftovermemes> i can see woolie playing monk
[1:18:26] <%SkellyVee> my bad lol
[1:18:28] <%TomAtlus> The Blackest Night is why I play dark knight
[1:18:29] <samuraicaveman> It's not that different from single player RPGs where you can't avoid all damage either. It's about taking little enough damage to win
[1:18:31] <+AustinEruption> we did it
[1:18:34] <+bladeworksmaster> Monk is so goddamn fun after 5.4
[1:18:34] <+AustinEruption> We are GAMING
[1:18:34] <+UKOrigin> are they stll skipping through dialogue?
[1:18:35] <%TomAtlus> It's crazy cool
[1:18:37] <%d1stantutopia> DRK, not BLK, I'm big dumb
[1:18:37] <$Noponis> it's not just memorizing. Execution can be hard as well
[1:18:40] <RocketBarrel> Does Minh do PF or is he in a static?
[1:18:40] <+Tucker1149> Lower sound effects as well
[1:18:42] <@Solidus_113> only you
[1:18:43] <+QueequegTheater> @AustinEruption big gamer hours

[1:19:02] <Zebroneath> 2P*
[1:19:04] <%SSaryn> She literally doesn't do damage anyway
[1:19:04] <+runegod20> Just because you pull off a combo once doesn’t mean you’ll never drop it in the future
[1:19:06] <+SunnyVarietyPack> no she follows group A
[1:19:06] <%ArkSeaside> 2P also doesn't take damage, if you were wondering
[1:19:08] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> she felt that woolie was watching
[1:19:08] <count_bob> Only A
[1:19:09] <DeltaD36> toopie sticks with A for most things

[1:19:44] <SomersaultJustice> buster sword
[1:19:46] <+OblivionSword1> depends
[1:19:47] <%ggbhtg> Does 2P get a Limit Break? bizHmm bizHmm bizHmm
[1:19:47] <@mothmandraws> I think easiest way to explain fun of beating a raid, its that feeling in overwatch where you and your team are perfect in sync and beating something hard
[1:19:47] <bestwaifuritsu> I have a feeling woolie would love samurai's lb3

[1:20:46] <+ArsCaelia> nooo do lb3 and summon migardsormr...
[1:20:48] <+QueequegTheater> LUL no
[1:20:51] <@Solidus_113> not in here
[1:20:51] <duchessdynamic> 💦
[1:20:51] <+mikesapartment> She's lighter here
[1:20:51] <jaysondeez> in this lighting engine its harder to tell
[1:20:52] <DeltaD36> Kind of
[1:20:52] <+Tucker0603> not in FFXIV
[1:20:53] <primaryfire> she's black in sc6 yeah
[1:20:53] <kulmoth> not in this game....
[1:20:53] <mr_red117> not really
[1:20:54] <Daxalog> No. It was a lighting thing.
[1:20:54] <dbag202> A+ for woolie
[1:20:54] <DSD24> She was supposed to be Chocco
[1:20:54] <+skyheys> It's much lighter in 14
[1:20:55] <SomersaultJustice> not as dark as sc6
[1:20:56] <prime_name> Lightened up for this game
[1:20:57] <T_Sasquatch> Yes but no
[1:20:57] <%strugglepunk2> they cowarded out
[1:20:58] <Prevot> not THAT dark
[1:20:58] <GarbageNirvana> "Yes"
[1:20:58] <DeltaD36> It's darker, but it's not black
[1:20:59] <MKII> it doesn't look as dark as it did in SC
[1:21:00] <jaysondeez> but she is darker skinned
[1:21:02] <+Metballs> Very slightly
[1:21:03] <androalfus> they took her melanin away
[1:21:05] <SomersaultJustice> SHIT SQUARE ENIX
[1:21:06] <+Arnschen> She does, but colours in general are washed out in XIV
[1:21:06] <cherrycottontail> she is tanned in this game but the lighting engine makes her look more pale
[1:21:06] <+Mountaindrewdle> Its like a lighting engine thing compared to SC6
[1:21:07] <+Metballs> If at all
[1:21:07] <jaysondeez> it just looks lighter in the light of this game
[1:21:07] <thetruenicster> IN SCVI she has dark skin, here she's white
[1:21:08] <JanusII> She's darker than 2B still.
[1:21:11] <ArthurDoyleRPG> doodHokey
[1:21:12] <+Tucker0603> she's the correct color in SCVI
[1:21:13] <bestwaifuritsu> @WoolieVersus Its because of the games lighting
[1:21:18] <%eyezehuhh> They Gal'd her
[1:21:18] <+QueequegTheater> There are no black people in Final Fantasy, don't be ridiculous
[1:21:19] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @WoolieVersus tank is calling for help in the chat
[1:21:19] <@Solidus_113> yeah
[1:21:19] <+getHazed> they just inverted the hair and dress colour
[1:21:20] <duchessdynamic> We just don't know
[1:21:20] <%d1stantutopia> Lighting engine

[1:21:25] <+A_DEAD_SHOW> SourPls
[1:21:25] <StencilOST> why indeed
[1:21:25] <+ZipperHands> FFXIV's lighting is weird and makes darker characters lighter
[1:21:26] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Its not as Dark as you remember
[1:21:26] <DeltaD36> lighting engine
[1:21:28] <penitentpendant> It was a lighting engine thing in Soul Calibur
[1:21:29] <Applecannon63> Square has issues with the lighting
[1:21:30] <T_Sasquatch> "LIGHTING"
[1:21:30] <duchessdynamic> (except we do)
[1:21:31] <exnuart> its the lighting
[1:21:31] <tuesti> there's only like 2 dark skinned characters in FF!$ unfortunately
[1:21:31] <illusbal> ffxiv lighting is not kind to dark skin characters
[1:21:33] <%SSaryn> Lighting engine, also she's not that dark.
[1:21:34] <+D00msDayDan> cowardice
[1:21:35] <quietshun> She's not THAT dark

[1:21:52] <MKII> the offícial figure that came out after SC6 also looked lighter
[1:21:55] <Dumple_Roe> they didn't, allegedly it was the "unreal engine" from SolCal 6
[1:21:58] <+QueequegTheater> I want her fucking dark chocalate, you cowards
[1:21:58] <kulmoth> pretty sure there is no pilot, she said its been hacked

[1:23:36] <%HitchhikingThrough> @WoolieVersus apparently soul calibur engine rendered her weirdly
[1:23:37] <@mothmandraws> read the text
[1:23:38] <DeltaD36> white salt... hmmmm
[1:23:39] <penitentpendant> Snowing in Summer, cough
[1:23:39] <+Metballs> The "flour"
[1:23:39] <%Chichen> @WoolieVersus Snow huh?
[1:23:40] <%Daskolin> It is not snow
[1:23:41] <+KingRipoff1> oh no they white washed her for sure
[1:23:46] <MKII> I can't believe this whole factory was behind door
[1:23:46] <funkerbuster> should have used the default dragoon meter
[1:23:47] <@mothmandraws> "is this snow"
[1:23:51] <%TheBensonator_> WOOLIE VS FFXIV?! woolieGASM
[1:23:54] <Solidnick18> aye it's him

[1:23:56] <illusbal> my boy
[1:23:57] <+A_DEAD_SHOW> ENGELS
[1:23:58] <+NYCrownlessKing> there is a canonical reason why this 2p does not have dark skin. this is not soul calibur 2p @woolieversus
[1:23:59] <asakura_ayase> Snow in summer
[1:24:00] <Zeldrick> Battle sound down, music up
[1:24:05] <+QueequegTheater> The official figure that came out was lighter too, it's likely that SC6 blackwashed her if anything
[1:24:06] <Johannen> Color is an illusion
[1:24:07] <%Chichen> SNOW
[1:24:08] <T_Sasquatch> That demo sold the game
[1:24:13] <donutlynx> Don’t die
[1:24:15] <+snausages_> Woolie are you going to try the FFXIV free trial which features the award winning expansion Heavensward?
[1:24:15] <+QueequegTheater> Darker 2P is still cooler
[1:24:15] <+Tucker1149> Battle sfx lower
[1:24:16] <+NYCrownlessKing> its a different version of 2p @woolieversus
[1:24:16] <exnuart> @Kazekyou no he just wants the nier stuff and minh is showing it off
[1:24:16] <@mothmandraws> @WoolieVersus notice the snow
[1:24:17] <+Tucker0603> COWARDS
[1:24:19] <donutlynx> LUL
[1:24:24] <funkerbuster> the meters are pretty sick, should have not used the simple one
[1:24:25] <%DashXero> Maybe it's the lighting?
[1:24:29] <JanusII> It's not like she's white. nemuLUL
[1:24:29] <DeltaD36> "snow"
[1:24:30] <%ggbhtg> @WoolieVersus Chat said it's because of the lighting engine but ALSO cowardice

[1:24:45] <donutlynx> Lighting engine is weird in this game
[1:24:47] <DSD24> @QueequegTheater But 2P showed up first in SC6
[1:24:47] <@Solidus_113> SourPls SourPls SourPls SourPls
[1:24:48] <+yukichocomilk> it's obviously cocaine
[1:24:48] <%d1stantutopia> More like snowdium chloride
[1:24:49] <+ArsCaelia> snow no
[1:24:49] <+ConLin_Arts_> SourPls
[1:24:50] <+TheBeachEpisode> Silly question, can controller users raise camera height like kb/m users can by holding ctrl + up/down
[1:24:54] <LordOfThePoultry> SourPls
[1:24:55] <penitentpendant> Music is GO
[1:24:57] <%ShinobiPhoenix> ENGELS
[1:24:58] <GuyNamedGatsby> snow LUL
[1:25:04] <%Juriasu> SourPls
[1:25:04] <+wunp_fxs> MUSIC is sooo good
[1:25:12] <$Noponis> bump up the music
[1:25:13] <JanusII> Turn music up midfight.
[1:25:13] <+yukichocomilk> yesssss
[1:25:15] <SkeletonManRevengeance> yeah please deal with that before the last fight
[1:25:15] <JanusII> Do it.
[1:25:17] <%ggbhtg> A lot of yall saying snow quote marks, so I'm guessing this is ashes of the dead
[1:25:17] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus drop player effects
[1:25:19] <+ApocalypticExpress> turn music up and battle sounds down
[1:25:19] <+CrownlessKitty> BGM 100
[1:25:20] <orlauncelot> Yeah controller users can adjust camera height
[1:25:20] <%Darmanimon> was that attack called Marx Smash? lol
[1:25:21] <+Graxe_> SFX gets very loud since it all stacks together
[1:25:21] <%samazonsky> samazonsky subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months, currently on a 3 month streak! Love you Woolie- Started playing more old handheld games, to get away from the mouse and keyboard. I forgot that i started on Pokemon Yellow, which really alters your experience with your starting Pokémon. Pikachu's push was absurd.
[1:25:22] <+JustBlubs> @TheBeachEpisode You can raise the camera height but I think you gotta go into the settings for it
[1:25:22] <bestwaifuritsu> ye ye ye
[1:25:26] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> lololololol
[1:25:26] <%SirGO0SE> SourPls
[1:25:26] <%Chichen> sound effects like 25
[1:25:27] <%dios_happy_hour> is the camera angle different for lala or soemthin'
[1:25:28] <+seoliart> The BGM mixing in FF14 is weird. Sometimes some tracks are loud and others are too soft
[1:25:30] <+QueequegTheater> @DSD24 That doesn't mean the design was changed later. The official design is lighter skinned.
[1:25:33] <dbag202> mid combat pls
[1:25:35] <JanusII> Good.
[1:25:37] <+QueequegTheater> SC changed it
[1:25:37] <LeiaSkynoober> @TheBeachEpisode Yes! You hold one of the top bumpers and pull back or forward on the stick
[1:25:42] <shinji_ifrit> yes
[1:25:43] <brachydios777> Good
[1:25:43] <+bladeworksmaster> Bipolar Nightmare is a weird track also
[1:25:44] <+Arnschen> Yes
[1:25:46] <+QueequegTheater> SC was right to do it, but still
[1:25:49] <%ggbhtg> A lot of yall saying snow quote marks, so I'm guessing this is ashes of the dead?
[1:25:51] <+Arnschen> 10,000
[1:25:55] <penitentpendant> Mechanics O CLOCK
[1:25:55] <+bladeworksmaster> for audio mixing

[1:25:58] <Solidnick18> SourPls
[1:26:01] <%d1stantutopia> @ggbhtg It's salt
[1:26:02] <jaysondeez> skelly is dark knight which does use mp for damage and a certain mitigation
[1:26:06] <%ArkSeaside> it's the ashes of one very large dead
[1:26:07] <+skyheys> @ggbhtg it's the premise of Nier 1
[1:26:13] <%ggbhtg> salt and iron, huh
[1:26:14] <SomersaultJustice> LUL
[1:26:15] <+TheBeachEpisode> @TheBeachEpisode Ah sweet, I wondered because they seem to tend to have half the screen just be the floor lol
[1:26:15] <GuyNamedGatsby> Y’all remember SP?
[1:26:16] <+DreyfussFrost> Use lock on LUL
[1:26:18] <Pandora_Prime> MINH wtf is up with your UI
[1:26:19] <+Graxe_> Use the lock on
[1:26:19] <inkthepeasant> LUL
[1:26:22] <+caramelatte1> PLAY RANGED dps
[1:26:22] <kulmoth> pretty sure the group can easily carry minh
[1:26:22] <+yukichocomilk> looking at bosses in ff114 LUL
[1:26:23] <+Toblo1> Melee DPS used to have an MP equivilent, but it was phased out, thankfully
[1:26:23] <+gespenst25> I understand I just don't care.
[1:26:24] <+gutlesscoward> MARX SMASH
[1:26:24] <ArthurDoyleRPG> doodLUL
[1:26:26] <iacus_> se weird that to figt well in an mmp you have to miss looking at the game
[1:26:28] <+QueequegTheater> Woolie wants zero MMO in his Nier
[1:26:34] <vVAstrAVv> we litterally cant woolie lol
[1:26:34] <aiutare47> Does it ever explain why the sick ass robot is named Engles?
[1:26:34] <%AlteisenReiseZ> WE DONT TALK ABOUT TP
[1:26:38] <brachydios777> White chlorination syndrome is a bitch
[1:26:38] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[1:26:41] <+Toblo1> TP was a hell time
[1:26:41] <%ggbhtg> @WoolieVersus There's a lock on, apparently?
[1:26:44] <+Toblo1> I'm glad its gone
[1:26:45] <+Metballs> OH GOD I HATE THAT CAMERA
[1:26:49] <SomersaultJustice> play in first person Kappa
[1:26:52] <bestwaifuritsu> play entirely in first person LUL
[1:26:59] <Applecannon63> "Snow" more like white chlorination syndrome
[1:27:00] <RyuuAoi> Woolie will figure it out
[1:27:01] <T_Sasquatch> He's playing a lala, it's rough
[1:27:06] <+ArsCaelia> mch in first person is just an fps
[1:27:06] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Is this the infamous "Anti-Woolie" gameplay?
[1:27:07] <%HollowedIdjit> A healer got tired of your shit
[1:27:10] <LeiaSkynoober> @TheBeachEpisode Fair fair lol. Sometimes you need to see the floor for mechanics and this boss especially can be difficult to see
[1:27:15] <ArthurDoyleRPG> That's the Echo Kappa
[1:27:17] <robo_badger> Rescue: the skill I never use because I'm bad at the game
[1:27:21] <+LittleBigQuebec> "somewhere safe" lies
[1:27:22] <+Arnschen> Sometimes
[1:27:22] <DeltaD36> rescue is for fixing fucky wuckys
[1:27:22] <$Rumbutt> somewhere safe, sure oroLUL
[1:27:25] <Bearheart223> Not always
[1:27:25] <+Mountaindrewdle> not in every fight just most
[1:27:30] <jaysondeez> sometiems you have to read the boss' tells
[1:27:31] <+Flightedwings> Only sometimes
[1:27:34] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Woolie did you see the tank being a stand user
[1:27:35] <androalfus> ctrl+arrow keys move the camera upwards for better visibility
[1:27:36] <+skyheys> THAT HAPPENS
[1:27:38] <vVAstrAVv> not in harder content
[1:27:38] <tuesti> @robo_badger same

[1:52:43] <jaysondeez> beard is part of helmet
[1:52:46] <funkerbuster> theyre all masks
[1:52:46] <%Akizea> @cobalt_phoenix_ it's literally free up to the first expac so before you play you got a LOT of stuff to go through to decide if you like it or not
[1:52:47] <%czeekytv> @PatStaresAt nah he's just gonna skip it, he's here for the raids only now Kappa
[1:52:48] <%kyh9> 2P says "There's good people on both sides"
[1:52:50] <gamewarden92> 2P is a Centrist?
[1:52:51] <Slim_Lipid> enlightened centrist 2P
[1:52:52] <Goraka91> Pick a side or fuck off
[1:52:53] <+LandOfTheWay> @LeRouch_the_Rebel fake beards attached to their helmets
[1:53:01] <+Metballs> 2P: enlightened centrist

[1:53:27] <brachydios777> Oh god
[1:53:27] <IntenseNerdRage> Does 2P subscribe to Bleach Japan's Newsletter?
[1:53:27] <+D00msDayDan> and now that 2p has said her lines and peaced out it's time for DWARVES
[1:53:37] <+AustinEruption> Story takes a whole nother raid to pick up
[1:53:42] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL

[1:54:12] <IntenseNerdRage> @queequegtheater LUL
[1:54:16] <speximillian> Dwarves are great! Lali-stop-hating-on-dwarves-ho!
[1:54:20] <+Fidranth> lore gathering time
[1:54:26] <@Solidus_113> the world, but not the enemies
[1:54:29] <dds333a> Not even a character, just here to fill space
[1:54:38] <%czeekytv> You also run the raids multiple times anyway
[1:54:38] <funkerbuster> Dwarves are canon according to yoko taro
[1:54:40] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Akizea i know i keep seeing the meme that's not really a meme about how most of it is free, i actually started like 2 months ago but dropped off bc i got sidetracked lol
[1:54:40] <+projectmanatees> yeah but you will be doing that boss fight a lot
[1:54:42] <+DreyfussFrost> Minh can lower where his character is centered on the screen in character config.
[1:54:50] <+VakyrieProfiling> the WoL's sass is pretty high in this questline
[1:55:10] <Applecannon63> POD MINION
[1:55:14] <%Akizea> @cobalt_phoenix_ it's deff a game that gets better the more you play at your own pace so take it easy, theres no rush lol

[1:55:41] <@Solidus_113> the quest is data
[1:55:41] <MyNameIsRasus> LOVE YOU POD
[1:55:42] <+snausages_> @WakeUpThrow the execution, tho that is the limits of MMO presentation to an extent. the way it feels shoehorned into the world of the first. it feels so isolated from xiv's story, i was really surprised to discover that its canon
[1:55:45] <Fiendmaw> NO

[1:57:14] <+QueequegTheater> NotLikeThis
[1:57:20] <+mikesapartment> it brings you here, is all
[1:57:21] <+AFoolishPaper> PADDING
[1:57:22] <boltstrykex> Grab the quest
[1:57:22] <+caramelatte1> The story takes you through here
[1:57:23] <iosephe> Suffering go up
[1:57:23] <OmegaTrigun> the quest takes you back in too
[1:57:24] <jaysondeez> it will but you will also come in here too
[1:57:24] <dds333a> Here we go again
[1:57:24] <+D00msDayDan> this is a big brain move, by doing it like this minh can extend the time woolie takes damage by being exposed to ff14
[1:57:24] <penitentpendant> The quest leads through the area, you can sightsee while continuing the story. No combat happens
[1:57:28] <Goraka91> The quest is to go in here yes LUL
[1:57:31] <+DreyfussFrost> The quest sends you in here.
[1:57:32] <jaysondeez> you can do both at the same time
[1:57:33] <+MTLxSpider> @WoolieVersus yes its 2 in 1.
[1:57:35] <passserby> 1 raid down and it's only been 2 hours, this'll be good
[1:57:36] <+Arnschen> The quest takes you through here
[1:57:38] <Fiendmaw> Quest and lore tour is the same thing
[1:57:41] <+bluedude153> no
[1:57:42] <+DreyfussFrost> No
[1:57:42] <+Arnschen> You have to do it again
[1:57:42] <mr_red117> no
[1:57:43] <+mikesapartment> no
[1:57:43] <PenGia> no
[1:57:44] <kitcorin> No
[1:57:46] <+bluedude153> you NEED to do the test
[1:57:46] <Louie_Salmon> It would be a second trip
[1:57:46] <%ArkSeaside> no you;ll have to go back
[1:57:46] <DedlokPM> no
[1:57:47] <PhilanthropyG> no. its different.
[1:57:47] <Zeif00> No
[1:57:48] <+caramelatte1> No you'll do it all over again
[1:57:49] <+MTLxSpider> nop
[1:57:51] <+DreyfussFrost> You'll have to run through twice.
[1:57:59] <plushysceptile> It won't
[1:57:59] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:58:03] <Goraka91> Repeating the same thing twice is the authentic Nier experience
[1:58:05] <funkerbuster> Nooooooooooo
[1:58:10] <%that__tj> Yeah it is, like running PAST the quest
[1:58:12] <%PatStaresAt> @WoolieVersus its only stupid if you bafflingly dont grab the quest
[1:58:16] <penitentpendant> Ending (D)eja Vu
[1:58:18] <sappmaster> ending B
[1:58:19] <+Arnschen> I mean, you would continue the quest to find out you could go here in the first place
[1:58:23] <boltstrykex> wooo
[1:58:26] <T_Sasquatch> Pat talking shit
[1:58:29] <dds333a> A lot of games do this as it is

[1:59:07] <cherrycottontail> @PatStaresAt ariW
[1:59:09] <+mojopork4u> I thought after years of Woolie edging "maybe one day" we would get him actually trying FFXIV! The backdown! I blame Pat!
[1:59:13] <iosephe> this is funny in retrospect
[1:59:13] <%HeroToxiko> i definitely added weight of the world to my random playlist years ago
[1:59:14] <+QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Tell Zangief I said he is a good boy who is not fat at all, poor guy needs positive reinforcement
[1:59:14] <dds333a> The observers
[1:59:21] <+RyTYoung> What level do you need to be to do the Nier stuff? haven't played FF 14 in a while, pretty sure I'm LV 55
[1:59:22] <@Menitta> what'd I miss
[1:59:23] <RyuuAoi> Pat is just like welcome to my Sundays *ambient piano music plays in BG*

[1:59:36] <iosephe> level cap
[1:59:38] <+krispen_wa> @rytyoung 80,at endgame after finishing all of shb
[1:59:38] <RyuuAoi> @menitta @patstaresat!
[1:59:40] <illusbal> it's post shadowbringers content
[1:59:41] <+DreyfussFrost> Since this was the first raid, most players wouldn't know about the collectables until they run through again when the quest sends them back. In this case, having the prior knowledge (and this content being a year old) tripped you up.
[1:59:42] <$arcielardor> Oh god Pat must be tearing his beard out over this
[1:59:42] <+SunnyVarietyPack> ☻☻☻
[1:59:45] <cherrycottontail> @RyTYoung 80 and ilvl 495 to finish it
[1:59:48] <@Menitta> oh damn
[1:59:54] <@Solidus_113> do you trust 2P or not
[1:59:56] <+krispen_wa> ANOGG ROUTE
[1:59:57] <+QueequegTheater> CHOOSE
[1:59:57] <lucky_icarus> 80 and have beaten the last expansion, Shadowbringers
[1:59:58] <+MTLxSpider> rip woolie
[2:00:00] <%JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> CHOOSE
[2:00:02] <%DatLatinoGuy> oh shit
[2:00:04] <+RyTYoung> Ty everyone, gotta get grinding NotLikeThis
[2:00:06] <+mojopork4u> Yeah this is confusingly worded.
[2:00:08] <dds333a> Konogg or Anogg?
[2:00:09] <deviljhojho_> YOUR CHOICES MATTER
[2:00:13] <penitentpendant> Anogg trusts 2P. Konogg doesn't.
[2:00:14] <funkerbuster> Anogg
[2:00:23] <+DreyfussFrost> Konogg wants to be careful, Anogg wants to be bold.
[2:00:24] <robo_badger> Konogg doesn't trust that easy
[2:00:25] <DeltaD36> Anogg is cooler
[2:00:29] <2DSuperiority> trust 2P or not trust 2P
[2:00:33] <deviljhojho_> You can be BOLD or BALD
[2:00:34] <+mikesapartment> anogg is gung ho
[2:00:38] <+krispen_wa> Annog LOVES danger
[2:00:38] <+SunnyVarietyPack> trust 2p or dont trust 2p?
[2:00:38] <kingkeldeo31> 2P or not 2P
[2:00:40] <gamewarden92> Simp for 2P or don't.
[2:00:42] <Arkfyre> more power!
[2:00:45] <penitentpendant> Both go exploring.
[2:00:45] <+ArsCaelia> nah you do the same stuff pretty much, there is a change but it's very very slight
[2:00:47] <RyuuAoi> Pat is playing DMC 2 tonight?
[2:00:53] <Ks201> Annog wants to go full force konnog wants to be more cautious
[2:01:23] <+ArsCaelia> konogg is good taste
[2:01:23] <Riorii> i did the same
[2:01:25] <deviljhojho_> YOUR CHOICES DONT MATTER
[2:01:32] <deviljhojho_> Or do they
[2:01:34] <vVAstrAVv> woolie has chosen option be "go slower"
[2:01:37] <+caramelatte1> Heads i win, Tails you lose
[2:01:42] <%Kain5707> ng+ )
[2:01:43] <T_Sasquatch> Go balls out
[2:01:43] <vVAstrAVv> surprise surprise
[2:01:43] <+DreyfussFrost> The choice just changes parts of the story, but not the ending or rewards.
[2:01:43] <%emperordread> The slow approach
[2:01:45] <Slim_Lipid> konogg can back down more easily
[2:01:48] <%Kain5707> :)
[2:01:48] <+Rabla> this choice actually changes the BGM here while exploring solo
[2:01:48] <SomersaultJustice> woolie holding down back
[2:01:51] <%czeekytv> "at least I had my honor"
[2:01:52] <+QueequegTheater> That was a terrible analogy
[2:01:58] <dds333a> If that's how you see it, I guess
[2:01:59] <Tracazoid> "What's this white egg thing? Maybe we should use it with reckless abandon."
[2:02:00] <Klefth> Wait, Woolie Vs WHAT NOW????
[2:02:03] <+MostRefinedCalla> Man I would love to see a Detroit Become Human raid
[2:02:04] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Mihn can change the camera for better view
[2:02:07] <Goraka91> Yes, no, maybe, I don't know, can you repeat the question?
[2:02:21] <+yukichocomilk> imagine not communicanting 24/7 with emotes
[2:02:22] <SomersaultJustice> is it disappointed?
[2:02:24] <DrFaustMD> makes me want to get back into 14

[2:02:48] <+DreyfussFrost> @WoolieVersus To help with seeing things at eye level, Minh can lower where his character is centered on screen to see more in front. The option is at the bottom of the first page of character config.
[2:02:51] <+dom3800> Wait does that choice actually matter?

[2:05:06] <+DreyfussFrost> @WoolieVersus There are 11 lore collectables in each of the first two raids, so you can count how many you got when you're done to check if you missed any.
[2:05:09] <+QueequegTheater> The robot fish?
[2:05:17] <+hephep_311> I think this is going well so far. don't stress too much!
[2:05:24] <jaysondeez> there are fishmen in this world, that might be what they are refering to
[2:05:30] <vVAstrAVv> why did eoolie read about the games freaking aoe markers and not about its nier lore lol
[2:05:30] <illusbal> this track still gives me chills
[2:05:32] <jaysondeez> for aquatic life
[2:05:34] <@mothmandraws> tbf woolie these notes are more noting that this place is wierd compared to some of the shit going on in the world with flood of light
[2:05:38] <penitentpendant> Big thing is, look for the "???" in the environment. They're often hid around corners and behind things.
[2:05:59] <%ggbhtg> @vvastravv because spoilers????
[2:06:05] <dds333a> Or zoom WAY OUT
[2:06:11] <ArkSeaside> it's one of the more charming notes that taro's game's has

[2:07:22] <jaysondeez> there is alot of customization you can do of yoru crossbars
[2:07:22] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus 16 per bar, and you can quick-access 3 bars
[2:07:22] <+mikesapartment> 12x3
[2:07:23] <MegboyManuel> A controller is surprisingly accessible for an MMO
[2:07:29] <+Lady_Cupcake> "Blue menu" TRASH
[2:07:30] <InXplotch> Why does min have a macro on his full thrust
[2:07:31] <+NYCrownlessKing> pat i blame u for this @patstaresat

[2:08:03] <+Leftovermemes> you can set L2+R2 or double taps for extra bars
[2:08:04] <+DreyfussFrost> Minh hotbar cycles FailFish
[2:08:04] <+mojopork4u> Skills and abilities have cooldowns and cast times, so it's actually a lot less crazy and slower than you'd think
[2:08:05] <+NYCrownlessKing> oh no

[2:08:07] <FennecZephyr> God Pat's mad

[2:08:33] <+Lady_Cupcake> FFXIV fans coming out the woodwork to criticize how other people play. As God intended.
[2:08:38] <+QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt some people don't like the double taps
[2:08:41] <%gatorafan> it sure is MMO in here daedra1DerpyTibs
[2:08:42] <@mothmandraws> minhs doing UWU im sure he will be fine
[2:08:47] <%justcallmebobplease> @FennecZephyr Did he express new salt, or is this just more of the salt over not using his FF/Nier vids for this?
[2:08:49] <MegboyManuel> This man has cleared savage content btw lmao
[2:08:52] <Lieutori> Minh can do Savage content at least
[2:08:52] <Slim_Lipid> which hotbar do y'all use for the ERP

[2:09:15] <lucky_icarus> You dont even need double tap, just use r2+l2/l2+r2

[2:10:08] <+MostRefinedCalla> Is this the most views Woolie has had on his normal streams?
[2:10:08] <+mojopork4u> The arrange album isn't good for Automata, but even the Alien Manifestation track is a banger

[2:15:04] <@mothmandraws> was it 11
[2:15:07] <+captainplanet88> @diztanc3 play it. make new ones. win win
[2:15:09] <%nabby1> did yoko taro help with this expansion at all?
[2:15:10] <T_Sasquatch> @queequegtheater to be fair it rides the line on that topic quite hard
[2:15:11] <+QueequegTheater> 11ish
[2:15:15] <RyuuAoi> You don't tell Pat to shut up. You tell Pat to go to bed.
[2:15:15] <dds333a> OG nier, I mean
[2:15:17] <Riorii> shit i missed alot then
[2:15:18] <+ArsCaelia> @mothmandraws 11 things for all
[2:15:21] <brachydios777> How long was Yorah being rebooted?
[2:15:25] <+D00msDayDan> @nabby1 he was running the project and wanted to wipe people's characters
[2:15:27] <DSD24> Eve was a big asshole
[2:15:34] <DSD24> Hate that guy
[2:15:35] <+diztanc3> @captainplanet88 True... Scholar is the best class ever in any MMO
[2:15:37] <JetpackMcQuack> Now they got shit done
[2:15:41] <+bluedude153> dwarf quests dwarf quests
[2:15:44] <+Maswrath> Took taro wanted characters to be deleted on wipe
[2:15:45] <+RowenCleric> I still dont understand Eve and his whole thing
[2:15:46] <penitentpendant> I believe "E" is considered the Cannon end?
[2:15:48] <+Ur3an> well they kill the aliens 500 years before automata
[2:15:50] <penitentpendant> So yes.
[2:15:51] <lucky_icarus> Look at that "snow" Woolz
[2:15:52] <+QueequegTheater> @T_Sasquatch P4 literally has a character almost look directly at camera and say "I'm not trans", only for people to say "oh they must be trans!"
[2:15:54] <@Solidus_113> Accord's flyer!
[2:15:55] <StencilOST> Woolie projecting his desires for space
[2:15:56] <+NYCrownlessKing> I think this is Canon to ending C with 9S @woolieversus like is after that.
[2:15:57] <Klefth> Go forth into space and cause a brat overflow
[2:16:00] <2DSuperiority> tattered flyer :)
[2:16:05] <+xxx420stoat69xxx> I'm confused, I just beat replicant, how is this connected?
[2:16:12] <%kewlmyc> Launching 9S's mind into space means that 2B is left all alone in Ending E
[2:16:12] <jaysondeez> there is something
[2:16:13] <datlambo458> We’re gonna have fun
[2:16:15] <EvanDude47> accord ad
[2:16:16] <jaysondeez> behind that container
[2:16:17] <+Mendin> ACCPRD
[2:16:17] <mr_saturday93> oh shit accord is mentioned here?
[2:16:23] <DSD24> @xxx420stoat69xxx You should play Nier Automata
[2:16:24] <DatAsuna> Fuck nines tho
[2:16:24] <%HeroToxiko> the adam and eve part was hilarious, oh hey the aliens were dead the entire fucking time and your fight was pointless
[2:16:24] <+RowenCleric> @xxx420stoat69xxx more connected to automata the sequel really
[2:16:26] <dds333a> @xxx420stoat69xxx by centuries
[2:16:26] <prime_name> What?
[2:16:27] <LordOfThePoultry> fuck nines
[2:16:29] <OkamiDude15> ???
[2:16:29] <%PatStaresAt> What?
[2:16:30] <DeltaD36> no it's A@'s route
[2:16:31] <T_Sasquatch> Uhhh wut ?
[2:16:32] <prime_name> Fuck Nines
[2:16:35] <JetpackMcQuack> it's complicated 4Head
[2:16:35] <+yukichocomilk> always choose the waifu
[2:16:36] <+The_Death_Owl> @xxx420stoat69xxx and furthermore what does Nier have to do with Final fantasy?
[2:16:38] <T_Sasquatch> Fuck 9s
[2:16:39] <brachydios777> @xxx420stoat69xxx Do you know what happens in Automata?
[2:16:40] <Goraka91> Fuck that bitch boy
[2:16:40] <%HeroToxiko> Yes woolie
[2:16:41] <@Solidus_113> the ark
[2:16:42] <cherrycottontail> A2's route is the one that actually works in the end
[2:16:43] <%eyezehuhh> I chose a2
[2:16:44] <+Conzanagi> I mean there's a happier ending with E
[2:16:45] <datlambo458> It’s complicated
[2:16:46] <+MoFroGT> @WoolieVersus you're onto something
[2:16:47] <TheYellowcouch> All my homies hate 9S
[2:16:48] <+snausages_> @xxx420stoat69xxx Connected to Automata, I think
[2:16:48] <AzureSynesthesia> Oh jeez how do you explain this to someone who’s only played replicant lol
[2:16:48] <+Mr_Pylon> but 9S is a bitch
[2:16:50] <+NarcissistCactus> nah I killed 9s
[2:16:50] <+Ur3an> no they kill eachother in 9s
[2:16:51] <+sevorai> A2 is the true end isnt it?
[2:16:53] <Solidnick18> A2 Kreygasm
[2:16:55] <DatAsuna> The ark is more hopeful but A2 is what I would pick
[2:16:56] <+Ur3an> a2 saves 9s in her ending
[2:16:59] <+QueequegTheater> @xxx420stoat69xxx You should go get B, C, and D endings
[2:17:00] <+Basilias_Maximus> Think it's the other way around.
[2:17:02] <%HeroToxiko> you do a2 before 9s
[2:17:03] <DatAsuna> A2 is the honkai impact Himeko route. lol
[2:17:04] <vVAstrAVv> 9s was like evil that doesn't sound good
[2:17:05] <@Solidus_113> you'll find out
[2:17:05] <%ConflagrationsGaming> yeaaa the ark was what i thought was going on with the crossover event
[2:17:06] <datlambo458> Cause which one chosen determines if the character her live or die after the fact
[2:17:07] <%KetsuoTaberu> the real data was the friends we made along the way
[2:17:07] <%jepupu> A2 takes the pod take 9s to safety before dropping the tower
[2:17:07] <+blue_cloak552> A2 leads to the good end of the epilogue
[2:17:08] <dbag202> Isn't the 9s the mutal kill?
[2:17:09] <+LandOfTheWay> @AzureSynesthesia you don't
[2:17:12] <BlackermanZX> isn't A2 is the true end
[2:17:14] <JetpackMcQuack> and it's aaaalll canon
[2:17:19] <+ToaDeathax> I believe the canon is split, the machine launch the ark and the protag androids remain
[2:17:19] <EvanDude47> we did figure it out after the third raid
[2:17:22] <%ConflagrationsGaming> was it ever confirmed which ending this was bouncing off of?
[2:17:23] <+blue_cloak552> 9S leads to the bad end
[2:17:29] <+NYCrownlessKing> I think after the whole raid its 9s ending of going jnto space. I think ending c or d? @woolieversus
[2:17:30] <+blue_cloak552> Yes
[2:17:31] <cherrycottontail> Pat help, correct them
[2:17:41] <Goraka91> Yes but then Nier was based on Drakengard's non-canon joke ending so Yoko gonna Taro
[2:17:44] <+Tarviti> @ConflagrationsGaming This is open ended enough where it fits any of the endings
[2:17:46] <+NYCrownlessKing> I think 9s ending @conflagrationsgaming
[2:17:51] <vVAstrAVv> you want PAT to correct people?
[2:17:53] <dds333a> Pat's words will fall on deaf ears
[2:17:55] <%PatStaresAt> Cherry im not allowed to correct them lol
[2:17:58] <%HeroToxiko> and we know what happens after the hope ending anyway LUL
[2:17:58] <DSD24> I hear a sound
[2:18:00] <%jepupu> 9s ending is the space ending / real ending
[2:18:03] <+snausages_> Ending E in Drakengard isn't a joke ending, tho it is trying to be extra mean to anyone who actually went to the effort in unlocking it
[2:18:06] <penitentpendant> A2's ending involves breaking the tower. 9S is the one with integration, Woolie is right.
[2:18:07] <+snausages_> like me :(
[2:18:10] <cherrycottontail> FeelsBadMan
[2:18:11] <+QueequegTheater> 9S is so obsessed with revenge that he dies screaming and slipping on his own blood
[2:18:15] <+QueequegTheater> what a hero
[2:18:27] <%HeroToxiko> @QueequegTheater he was the coolest guy
[2:18:28] <DSD24> @QueequegTheater Man that was hard to watch
[2:18:32] <T_Sasquatch> Sometimes i forget 9s is insane
[2:18:32] <vVAstrAVv> @patstaresat they never heard of crazy talk clearly
[2:18:37] <Goraka91> @snausages_ It's a joke troll ending yes, it definitely wasn't intended to be canon at the time
[2:18:38] <+Rabla> I'm going to bed you guys enjoy this transcendant trainwreck
[2:18:44] <%PatStaresAt> Man woolies gunna be sad as shit when he realises the next 45 mins to an hour is all dwarf all the time
[2:18:46] <Saltmeisterr> Pod with no DC Douglas voice is a shame

[2:19:02] <AzureSynesthesia> Ending E in drakengard was def originally meant to be a joke. It ends with seere going “THANKS FOR PLAYING” in a singsong voice after your characters get shot down lol

[2:20:51] <+mojopork4u> Cycles in both Nier and Automata are both an understanding of realworld societal issues (esp. war) & pre-texts for active change of status quo. It's mindful and doesn't revel in its sorrow for the sake of crass emotional manipulation.

[2:23:35] <dds333a> In this case, it's more ambient than anything, but yeah
[2:23:36] <GuyNamedGatsby> Of course Woolie can handle dwarf conversation, I mean he has been podcasting with Pat for how many years?
[2:23:38] <sendart> woolie is refusing to internalize that the dwarves are the main plot

[2:24:09] <sappmaster> game become Nier no dwarves
[2:24:09] <+QueequegTheater> Woolie wants the lowest common denominator version of crossovers
[2:24:10] <+snausages_> IMO optimal version is they have the XIV characters react more to the crazy infusion of Nier stuff into the first, which is what was imo missing
[2:24:10] <dauver> there is nothing to extract

[2:24:39] <vVAstrAVv> youll get nier faster if you backseat bitch less
[2:24:47] <datlambo458> Honestly the first raid has the least lore content
[2:24:47] <+MostRefinedCalla> Hey Woolie, if you want new Nier lore, play Nier Replicant 1.22
[2:24:49] <mr_saturday93> This whole raid makes FF 14 Canon to nier and drakengard
[2:24:51] <UnsteadyFunk> Minh's Usagi Yojimbo cosplay really selling the moment.

[2:25:28] <+ChaosEmralds> he HATES IT
[2:25:31] <+QueequegTheater> SHOW HIM THE KOTR FIGHT
[2:25:33] <%czeekytv> the heavy dialogue you're complaining about is in Nier tho
[2:25:34] <feralspidey> wait when did Woolie get a Chunk Chocobo? Did he do the KFC Boss Raid?
[2:25:34] <+ClericOfSparda> This is VERY Educational!
[2:25:36] <Klefth> Boy, if only he knew how Shadowbringers goes....
[2:25:36] <vVAstrAVv> youre seeing a sidequest dude
[2:25:37] <iosephe> free trial though
[2:25:38] <+Jiggisnipe> he's getting confirmation bias that FF14 is anti-Woolie
[2:25:38] <RyuuAoi> Woolie will get in.

[2:25:41] <+spartan_ermine> BIG CHUNGUS CHOCOBO

[2:25:46] <Dragon_Batman> There was never a chance for Woolie to want to play this, but that's kool

[2:25:48] <T_Sasquatch> its Coooool

[2:25:53] <+Jiggisnipe> it might be more than anti-Woolie
[2:25:54] <+mojopork4u> High Sodium Alert!
[2:25:54] <Solidnick18> LUL
[2:25:55] <+Masked_Hero_Lucky> The main story gets more effort put into it though, after ARR at least
[2:25:55] <@Solidus_113> on god?
[2:25:56] <DatAsuna> Woolie you did 2 hour long videos on FF14 before. lol
[2:25:58] <%ggbhtg> @feralspidey minh is playing
[2:25:58] <%kyh9> Yeah, FFXIV is a classic-ass MMO. Not for everyone
[2:25:58] <penitentpendant> Wow, that person was SUPER wrong
[2:25:59] <nobody287> this is seeing DMC2 and think DMC sucks
[2:26:01] <+paladinstarbuster> Youre seeing side extra content
[2:26:02] <%DatLatinoGuy> no cap
[2:26:02] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:26:04] <+Maswrath> It’s not for everyone, but it is for a lot of people
[2:26:04] <$arcielardor> fat chocobo theme is the theme of woolies disinterest
[2:26:06] <Solidnick18> for reals
[2:26:06] <TheYellowcouch> You're not even playing which is the good stuff I mean
[2:26:07] <mr_saturday93> So... from my understanding Woolie never listens to anything ppl say. That explains a lot actually
[2:26:08] <+MugenSandan> Woolie if you're not even going to engage with the FF14 part of it, why are you even doing this you could have just googled this stuff or watched Pat's stream
[2:26:10] <%Kain5707> has Woolie not seen monk?
[2:26:10] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @Tucker0603
[2:26:11] <%ggbhtg> woolieONEGUY IRL
[2:26:11] <Goraka91> Famous fighting game player WoolieVersus isn't a fan of an MMORPG? D:
[2:26:14] <+Sharmanyx> !EXTRA CONTENT!
[2:26:14] <%baronblank> it doesn't help that Minh has basically just been saying "the ff14 stuff sucks, we gotta skip it" lol
[2:26:16] <passserby> if you really think about it, ffxiv is really a fighting game deep inside :)
[2:26:17] <+QueequegTheater> @DatAsuna no, that was pat and Liam and I think pat edited them
[2:26:17] <+gespenst25> Shadowbringers is the best final fantasy story. <.<
[2:26:20] <penitentpendant> A carnival, with familiar music
[2:26:21] <RyuuAoi> Woolie you NEED a time consumer.
[2:26:21] <+Masked_Hero_Lucky> It's ridiculous to judge the entirety of FFXIV based on a side thing
[2:26:23] <Ks201> You might enjoy the main story overall @woolieversus
[2:26:24] <%radregice> @MugenSandan because people want to see his reactions
[2:26:26] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus I sent the list of them all on Twitter
[2:26:29] <dds333a> @nobody287 Nah, dude, come on. this is actually good by itself
[2:26:33] <devanmuse> the second raid hasn't started yet, has it?
[2:26:34] <+snausages_> ffxiv is a synchronised 8 man DDR game inside, at least on savage
[2:26:37] <+NYCrownlessKing> guys stop caring.w
[2:26:38] <Ianrazz> Show him Seat of Sacrifice or any of the four lords fight, this is weak shit ferroSmug
[2:26:40] <+DreyfussFrost> @WoolieVersus Yeah it's 11 for part 1, 11 for part 2, and none for part 3.
[2:26:43] <+BappoTheMighty> OH SHIT! Minh is back! Welcome back Minh. Missed you so much brother!
[2:26:44] <+NYCrownlessKing> woolie doesn't care let him be
[2:26:44] <%gatorafan> this village looks like depression
[2:26:51] <GuyNamedGatsby> Woolie wouldn’t survive ARR
[2:26:51] <penitentpendant> @Solidus_113 Thanks, that'll save time
[2:26:52] <+bluedude153> I wish to see woolie suffer
[2:26:52] <+snausages_> Oh yeah Seat of sacrifice is some kino, even if you have no interest in MMOs
[2:26:53] <Klefth> Yeah, Shadowbringers story puts the story in most FFs in literal decades now to shame tbh
[2:26:54] <InXplotch> there are 11 total in the first zone
[2:26:55] <+mikesapartment> man screw that, you can google it
[2:26:59] <+NYCrownlessKing> accept he hates ur game lol
[2:27:00] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Is he a fucking lalafel?
[2:27:03] <inksmears> it doesn't help that a lot of this was in between patch stuff to tide people over between 3 month waits...
[2:27:31] <%Akizea> @guynamedgatsby he deffinately would not lol
[2:27:34] <UnsteadyFunk> Who is in here actually expecting Woolie to get into an MMO? Ain't gonna happen, chief lol
[2:27:37] <yerbia> I think woolie would get in if he saw and understood the skill ceiling for the combat
[2:27:38] <Cubblesv2> @Ianrazz The thing with Seat of Sacrifice is that it's multiple pop offs that require all of the build up you've gotten since 2.0. But yeah, I agree it's far more of a spectacle than the Nier stuff
[2:27:44] <RyuuAoi> Woolie doesn't have control so that definitely playing a factor. @woolieversus COWARD #BillyVersus
[2:27:46] <dds333a> There's still time yet, but we'll see.
[2:27:46] <+snausages_> @inksmears this is like the perennial problem with ffxiv, especially the bloating of some MSQ patch content with lots of story missions
[2:27:49] <+Maswrath> If nothing else Woolie should listen to all the music, I’m sure pat can get a list of reccomendations
[2:27:51] <%Zundelle> there was never a chance of woolie liking this game, but ye it's also sidquest stuff
[2:27:52] <%ArkSeaside> I'd say Heavensward also puts most recent FFs to shame too. Stormblood is alright
[2:27:55] <JetpackMcQuack> neat
[2:27:55] <feralspidey> @ggbhtg Ah, thanks!
[2:28:03] <+MugenSandan> he can hate FF14 that's fine, maybe it would be nice if he didn't do a stream and yell it to the heavens
[2:28:03] <@Solidus_113> I can send the next set too
[2:28:11] <Ianrazz> Doesn't help that the Nier raids are quite literally a downgrade from other alliance raids. Ivalice kicks ass ferroAYAYA
[2:28:17] <inksmears> the nier story in ff14 is very bad so that is also not helping lol
[2:28:21] <+NYCrownlessKing> no deal with it lol @mugensandan
[2:28:22] <inksmears> the raids are cool but the story is not great
[2:28:24] <+NYCrownlessKing> accept it
[2:28:26] <+DreyfussFrost> Oh yeah, those ones at the end are very easy to miss. They put the next part of the main quest directly in front of you and don't tell you it will take you out of the area.
[2:28:26] <penitentpendant> The "9S trauma room"
[2:28:28] <+NYCrownlessKing> embrace it
[2:28:28] <%ArkSeaside> I'm pretty sure that a large part of Woolie's distaste for ff14 is it being filtered through PAt
[2:28:30] <+alphonseisbest> Doesn't help that the Nier raids are quite literally a downgrade from other alliance raids. Ivalice kicks ass
[2:28:31] <jaysondeez> still good to explore
[2:28:37] <+Maswrath> Fair
[2:28:37] <%ggbhtg> @mugensandan its his stream, everyone knows he doesnt like it :)
[2:28:37] <+snausages_> I think if Woolie saw Black Mage gameplay in savage he might get the appeal a little more, cause it kinda dials into that whole Vergil aesthetic with the teleports and big burst damage
[2:28:38] <%Akizea> @ianrazz iunno bout that lol but whatever
[2:28:39] <jaysondeez> but you get whatever is on the first pass
[2:28:45] <dundunsun> It’s nice that he doesn’t need your permission to do stuff
[2:28:46] <Fiendmaw> As good as the story is,it's not enough to carry someone through it if they're not interested in the MMO bits.
[2:28:47] <+QueequegTheater> The Nines jerking-off room
[2:28:47] <Klefth> Of course Minh just uses the fucking fat chocobo... lol
[2:28:50] <+projectmanatees> Patt was rightt never for get
[2:28:51] <+alphonseisbest> he nier story in ff14 is very bad so that is also not helping lol PogChamp coxDerp
[2:29:02] <speximillian> If they were dwarf corpses, Woolie wouldn’t care less
[2:29:03] <InXplotch> no, theres almost no way woolie would enjoy the gameplay of any of the classes in ffxiv
[2:29:06] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Gonna be honest here Lalas should be sent to the sun
[2:29:08] <Ianrazz> @Akizea I dunno but whever I got nier on the raid roulette it was fuckin boring centrail

[2:29:30] <+BlackMageMog> While 14 overall may not be Woolie’s cup of tea, this isn’t exactly the most fair shot at it. Especially how he isn’t interested in the framing device for the content he is looking for
[2:29:30] <DatAsuna> go to horny jail

[2:32:43] <+mojopork4u> His Cat; The Taunting; The Blowup; The Phone Call-- This may be the most effective push of Pat being able to make Woolie actually salty
[2:32:51] <%HeroToxiko> Taro: suffer for lore, do it
[2:32:51] <+snausages_> Ivalice was such a high quality series, it shows you can make great raid content that isn't just super high end difficulty stuff.
[2:32:53] <Ianrazz> I rather wipe a couple times on Orbone or Ridoranna than do copied factory, just my opinion tho
[2:32:55] <vVAstrAVv> dont enjoy cats says eoolie
[2:32:57] <bestwaifuritsu> Dont mess wit dat old Machina brother, its bad juju.

[2:36:02] <dds333a> One of several
[2:36:03] <penitentpendant> It's the Shadowbringers battle theme, each expansion has it's own for overworld fights
[2:36:07] <@Solidus_113> Shadowbringers is all butt rock
[2:36:09] <SpaghettiTime44> Is this the Nier stuff? Is that why it's happening?
[2:36:09] <T_Sasquatch> Yes its SiCK

[2:36:19] <+QueequegTheater> Yes
[2:36:23] <+spartan_ermine> 530
[2:36:25] <penitentpendant> He's overgeared
[2:36:26] <PenGia> ridiculously strong
[2:36:26] <@Solidus_113> not really
[2:36:28] <Hoodywolf> dps are usually strong and hes probably geared for end game content
[2:36:29] <nobody287> no
[2:36:29] <%HollowedIdjit> not really
[2:36:29] <%czeekytv> Minh is basically Best-In-Slot
[2:36:30] <FunnyCrimes> ayy he plays on my server coxSeafood coxSoup
[2:36:32] <Goraka91> Little bit yes
[2:36:32] <+mikesapartment> not in the overworld

[2:36:39] <Riorii> hes a dps so big damage
[2:36:40] <MegboyManuel> nah theyre super east
[2:36:41] <jaysondeez> if you know what you are doing, the fights are not a problem
[2:36:41] <PhazonSuited> 24-mans are still on the easier end of level cap content
[2:36:41] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus He's overgeared and a high damage class
[2:36:44] <MegboyManuel> easy*
[2:36:44] <@Solidus_113> no
[2:36:47] <+OblivionSword1> no
[2:36:47] <dds333a> URTUROSU
[2:36:48] <jaysondeez> there is sync
[2:36:48] <dbag202> "few seconds"
[2:36:48] <%czeekytv> @Aeogard Minh has cleared this tier e12s

[2:36:49] <+Vijuani> No
[2:36:50] <DatAsuna> no
[2:36:50] <+Mendin> Yeah that's E12S ilevel
[2:36:51] <+DreyfussFrost> @WoolieVersus No, not random enemies out in the world. They're supposed to be pretty easy because the game needs to be playable by a wide skill range.
[2:36:51] <mr_red117> no
[2:36:53] <FunnyCrimes> you scale to it
[2:36:53] <%zacyzacy> no you scale to the raid
[2:36:53] <+mojopork4u> No not really, this is the normie mill that anyone can play @WoolieVersus The damage differences are negligible
[2:36:54] <+MeyB_7> Theme of dwarf talk
[2:36:54] <RyuuAoi> @patstaresat Please sing the ride my Chocobo song for old times sake! TehePelo
[2:36:54] <InXplotch> @WoolieVersus fighting overworld monsters is usually not a challenge unless you are dramatically undergeared. the raids scale you down to their level
[2:36:56] <jaysondeez> but current raids don't sync
[2:36:56] <Ianrazz> No
[2:36:57] <tuesti> they're going to fix the scaling
[2:37:04] <+Maswrath> We held back so you could see all the moves
[2:37:05] <%Aeogard> @czeekytv holy shit go minh!! i had no idea
[2:37:07] <Wildpandaman> Their fixing scale god dahm mhin
[2:37:10] <datlambo458> You get set down
[2:37:17] <+skyheys> raids scale you down
[2:37:24] <smallboops> somehow all if this feels like pats orchestration to personally attack woolie its like hes stabbing him with an mmo
[2:37:28] <InXplotch> @WoolieVersus you can only overpower a raid by a little bit, if you are too strong it weakens you to an appropriate level
[2:37:29] <2DSuperiority> nier gear the gear from the nier
[2:37:31] <+MeyB_7> otherwise known as patstaresat stream
[2:37:39] <%czeekytv> @Aeogard yeah I didn't know either, I just cleared it myself on Sunday lol so count me impressed
[2:37:40] <Ks201> If Minh is 530 he is actually at the highest gear cap till the next expansion
[2:37:44] <%Aeogard> Where are we at, are we still pre First Raid or almost at number 2?

[2:37:59] <+Jiggisnipe> Pat was large
[2:37:59] <%czeekytv> almost at 2
[2:38:00] <penitentpendant> Camera changes dependent on your character height
[2:38:01] <RedVelvetNite> almost at second raid
[2:38:06] <+ArsCaelia> yep, this is weird to watch as a hyur/roe player
[2:38:07] <+Maswrath> I thought it was 535 with savage gear
[2:38:08] <+CookieCutter007> *nods*
[2:38:09] <penitentpendant> You get a lot of low angles for this questline
[2:38:10] <InXplotch> Yes the camera is adjusted to your height, so if you are tall you are constantly looking down at these nerds
[2:38:11] <+QueequegTheater> Tekken camera is 3
[2:38:12] <%HollowedIdjit> I play an Au Ra, this looks so different from what I've seen
[2:38:13] <%Aeogard> How did Woolie like Copied Factory? I just popped in
[2:38:14] <+Kyma1020> Dwarves look up at you if you're taller
[2:38:14] <RyuuAoi> Billy is a potato @woolieversus Live with it!
[2:38:16] <mudapersona> FFXIV?!? Did Pat finally make Woolie give in?
[2:38:17] <adithehella> Final Fantasy XIV: Butterfingers
[2:38:19] <sandwichpeddler> If youre tall all these guys kill their neck to look at you
[2:38:20] <+FrostedZaibatsu> adjusted for your race?
[2:38:25] <%ArkSeaside> there's that one cutscene where a character locks eyes with you, and he has to crouch if you're a lala
[2:38:30] <%ggbhtg> @mudapersona minh is playing
[2:38:31] <+DreyfussFrost> @WoolieVersus Everything involved with the Nier raids is on the very easy end of difficulty in 14. Difficulty scales WAY up in hard modes of the others raids, but Square Enix hasn't made any hard modes for alliance (24 person) raids yet.
[2:38:33] <dbag202> Woolie wants Nier Lore
[2:38:38] <+MeyB_7> sorry bad joke
[2:38:42] <+Leftovermemes> stupid patch stuff
[2:38:45] <+mikesapartment> it is in fact made by cid
[2:38:46] <corn_dad> @DreyfussFrost DR Savage
[2:38:48] <+Jiggisnipe> was that Ark?
[2:38:48] <mudapersona> @ggbhtg ahh makes more sense lol
[2:38:50] <+Maswrath> There’s at least one instance in storm blood share being a lala is hilarious
[2:38:54] <+mojopork4u> Skipping through villager dialogue NotLikeThis
[2:38:54] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Cid made it
[2:38:54] <%DatLatinoGuy> gib L O R E
[2:38:57] <alrobot2014> yeah that looked like Ark
[2:38:58] <dds333a> yea, exactly
[2:38:59] <%KuroStardust> Theres cool mech stuff in this game Woolz
[2:39:03] <%ArkSeaside> the closest to a hard mode alliance raid is Delubrum Reginae Savage
[2:39:08] <$StaceMcGate> Nier Lore being 10% of the Nier questline
[2:39:09] <+QueequegTheater> @mojopork4u Woolie said he doesn't care
[2:39:13] <EL_TRO> dont fall asleep
[2:39:14] <%gatorafan> When are we getting to the Nier factory!!!???? daedra1CryingTibs

[2:39:23] <SomersaultJustice> daddy woolie is gonna grab some cigs and come back :<
[2:39:24] <penitentpendant> "Get some smokes, be back in a bit."
[2:39:24] <%Chichen> woolie leaves for "Milk and cigarettes"

[2:39:24] <%ArkSeaside> woolie goes out for cigarettes
[2:39:25] <Hoodywolf> stuff is about to kick off

[2:39:40] <Goraka91> Lali-freaking-ho
[2:39:40] <+DreyfussFrost> Yeah DR savage is kind of an exception, but it's not part of the main alliance raid series anyway.
[2:39:45] <+crossing_mao> And never return
[2:39:54] <Ianrazz> Woolie has check out, Minh
[2:39:54] <Dragon_Batman> Well that is an extremely high bar

[2:40:00] <DaKnightWarrior> Monster Hunter is king.
[2:40:01] <+gespenst25> Yeah, no shit.
[2:40:02] <+snausages_> You should see the barrel graphics in 1.0. Industry setting standards
[2:40:02] <+mojopork4u> This game was made for PS3
[2:40:03] <+QueequegTheater> Woolie that is not fair
[2:40:05] <s_snowball> mmos are not actual games
[2:40:06] <Chimeraelite> no food porn here
[2:40:07] <dds333a> Fucking whatever, Woolie CarlSmile
[2:40:08] <nobody287> yeah cause this is a slightly better PS3 game
[2:40:09] <%ArkSeaside> ff15 food is not fair woolie
[2:40:09] <+Maswrath> Asahi getting in your face means he has to crouch down to make eye contact
[2:40:10] <+Jiggisnipe> Woolie stop, that's not fair
[2:40:10] <%kewlmyc> He got you there, woolie
[2:40:11] <+KawaiiJetty> FFXIV pizza is just freaking bread
[2:40:11] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:40:11] <%DatLatinoGuy> nothing can top MH food
[2:40:11] <ClarentMordred> woolie this needs to be able to run on a toaster
[2:40:11] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Woolie this is a PS3 game
[2:40:13] <datlambo458> Are you going to go get some milk Woolie
[2:40:13] <+Neku054> it has to run on potato PCs
[2:40:14] <2DSuperiority> we had bread that had a bite taken out of it
[2:40:14] <+OblivionSword1> Woolie this game is old
[2:40:15] <%SveriSageAdvice> oh you mean the jpegs?
[2:40:16] <cherrycottontail> IT's PS3 food
[2:40:17] <%gitgouda> whatever give bread tech now
[2:40:18] <PhazonSuited> in the 1.0 version of this game there were flowerpots with more polygons and shader coding than an entire player character. it was horrid
[2:40:19] <%KuroStardust> There's some real low Poly-counts in this game lol
[2:40:19] <+TipsyND> Why is this PS3 game looking so bad?
[2:40:19] <RyuuAoi> Woolie I got a Mexican Market on the corner. What you want? I got you! Takis And a Coke?
[2:40:20] <UnsteadyFunk> We have new MILK TECH THO
[2:40:21] <mudapersona> ff 15 cooking was better than the combat
[2:40:23] <+MeyB_7> that shank of "chicken" looks liek it was burn by a torch and that grew mold
[2:40:24] <%Aeogard> This is about dressing up your catgirl sexy, Woolie, not anything else. @WoolieVersus
[2:40:26] <SomersaultJustice> just stick some jpgs on there
[2:40:26] <%DatLatinoGuy> except Vanillaware when it's 2D
[2:40:26] <vVAstrAVv> we really complaining about the food now...
[2:40:26] <brachydios777> 7th generation
[2:40:28] <@Solidus_113> SourPls
[2:40:29] <+FrostedZaibatsu> PSO2 food looks better
[2:40:29] <+bladeworksmaster> fucking flowerpots
[2:40:30] <+quiriarte> not yakuza bread 0/10
[2:40:30] <%ArkSeaside> woolie there are some prettied up FF12 models in here
[2:40:32] <DatAsuna> Woolie the point of comparison is games from 2011
[2:40:34] <kehnimentu> once we drop ps4 support it'll be better
[2:40:35] <valriot> SourPls
[2:40:35] <Dragon_Batman> Amusement park music by the way
[2:40:35] <sappmaster> oh
[2:40:36] <DSD24> Hey its this song!
[2:40:36] <+gespenst25> Woolie would have greenlit the prettiest flowerpot in the realm.
[2:40:37] <primaryfire> lower your standards, woolie. remember MMOs are meant to be bad
[2:40:37] <+ArsCaelia> they tried to make this look nice and we got barrels with more polygons than player characters
[2:40:37] <%Zundelle> monster hunter food models are constructed by legendary gods
[2:40:38] <+NYCrownlessKing> yes
[2:40:42] <Slim_Lipid> @QueequegTheater Monster Hunter on the PSP had better food
[2:40:42] <+Arnschen> Ye the song
[2:40:42] <+JustBlubs> This game was built on Crystal Tools while FFXV was able to utilize the full power of the Luminous Engine of course it looks worse
[2:40:43] <+mikesapartment> this game has spaghetti code
[2:40:44] <Arkfyre> ps3 limitations
[2:40:44] <+Maswrath> Square Enix is a small indie company, please understand
[2:40:48] <speximillian> That food is nowhere near the level of PSO2
[2:40:49] <+MeyB_7> @Zundelle This is truw
[2:40:49] <penitentpendant> Hello nostalgia music
[2:40:52] <MKII> and the game's codebase is really really old
[2:40:53] <SailingSaturn> now its PC holding us back cirSlain
[2:40:56] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[2:40:58] <+QueequegTheater> @Slim_Lipid And it still isn't an MMO
[2:40:58] <InXplotch> woolie you're right
[2:41:00] <%gitgouda> everything is bread, always bread.
[2:41:00] <InXplotch> but you're wrong
[2:41:01] <Solidnick18> yakuza bread tech is peak
[2:41:01] <Goraka91> Every game should have Yakuza bread
[2:41:02] <RyuuAoi> OOOOO MONEYYYYYYY
[2:41:03] <Hoodywolf> its all just that piece of bread
[2:41:04] <nobody287> that bread cost 5 million dollars
[2:41:04] <dds333a> All of it
[2:41:05] <RyuuAoi> NO
[2:41:05] <mr_red117> PS3 limitations about to become PS4 limitations
[2:41:06] <+KawaiiJetty> You have a point
[2:41:07] <+Jiggisnipe> every game should be Y7
[2:41:09] <+SouLucha> Food should look like food otherwise what's the point?
[2:41:11] <Mr_216> bah god
[2:41:12] <%Garthunox> you mean the other thing pat told you about?
[2:41:13] <%Akizea> man imagine if ffxiv got to see the money ffxiv made
[2:41:15] <+Maswrath> Please understand
[2:41:17] <vVAstrAVv> WHY ISNT EVERYTHING THE BEST EXAMPLE I HAVe
[2:41:17] <+ArsCaelia> okay call me when your pc/console catches fire
[2:41:20] <BlueLunecy> No bread, just archon loaf
[2:41:22] <2DSuperiority> because FISHING
[2:41:26] <%ggbhtg> 0/10
[2:41:30] <+Maswrath> Oh god the loaf

[2:41:32] <+ArsCaelia> archon L O A F
[2:41:37] <datlambo458> Why isn’t Naruto just hunter x hunter!!!
[2:41:44] <+TipsyND> Wow it's almost like Yoko Taro wrote a quest to make fun of MMOs
[2:41:46] <penitentpendant> Sad music for a festival
[2:41:51] <+Cuon_Alpinus> I legitimately almost had a sp[ittake when i saw the game listed under woolie's stream lmao
[2:41:52] <mr_saturday93> Why isn't a penis a vagina!?
[2:41:58] <vVAstrAVv> why isnt woolie one punch man
[2:41:59] <+mojopork4u> If you want extra LUL s have Minh buy a Bread off the Marketboard and have him show you the eating animation for it LUL
[2:42:01] <SomersaultJustice> why aren't fighting games just good
[2:42:02] <+Maswrath> Why isn’t all of DC MHA?
[2:42:05] <+QueequegTheater> Why isn't Deku just Gon, says Eyepatch Wolf
[2:42:05] <+RyTYoung> LUL
[2:42:07] <+wunp_fxs> Fat moogle! big chuker
[2:42:07] <T_Sasquatch> @mr_red117 realistically apart from texture quality how much could they do really ? It's not like they'll put a thousand mobs in the game.
[2:42:10] <penitentpendant> No, it's a Gigamog
[2:42:11] <mudapersona> its a fat chocobo
[2:42:14] <Tenkay> Its not a baloon its a fat moogle

[2:42:23] <SomersaultJustice> look at that bourgeoise jerk
[2:42:24] <+sevorai> Nooo not a balloon lmao
[2:42:26] <%Garthunox> @WoolieVersus if you dont care, why didnt you just watch videos of the nier stuff specifically?
[2:42:28] <+QueequegTheater> Yeah it's great
[2:42:29] <dds333a> Even then, some PS3 games still look great, but yeah, FFXIV has had a lot of historical issues, kinda
[2:42:29] <%Aeogard> mounts are so obnoxious
[2:42:30] <penitentpendant> Delubrum (Savage)
[2:42:33] <%jepupu> Obnoxious mounts have become a real problem in FFXIV.
[2:42:35] <mudapersona> damn moogle get that big too lmaooo

[2:42:55] <%nabby1> the struggle stream
[2:42:58] <penitentpendant> On the bright side, you only have to beat it once for the mount
[2:42:59] <Zeif00> Flex Mounts
[2:42:59] <%jepupu> Everyone's on a sparklepony or FF15 poverty convertible.
[2:42:59] <%ConflagrationsGaming> because he can sit down with his friend and watch it? enjoying it in person
[2:43:01] <42nfl19> Didn't they add a Limo/Bus that seats a full party of 8? I remember Pat talking about it
[2:43:02] <Goraka91> @jepupu Look I play GW2 this shit is fine in comparison, at least they don't glow like the sun
[2:43:04] <cherrycottontail> director of yokai watch is a friend of yoshi p

[2:45:17] <+QueequegTheater> I want my Wesker pod
[2:45:23] <jackythefrost> voice acting is reserved for only main story content
[2:45:24] <+mojopork4u> It's basically a Taro short story you're reading through that works off of FFXIV villager dialogue

[2:46:02] <+mojopork4u> @WoolieVersus Did you know that Taro helped write the dwarf stuff? That's the big stuff
[2:46:03] <Alice_Lufenia> you'll just be so much more lost that way
[2:46:03] <%ConflagrationsGaming> Let the pod TALK dammit
[2:46:04] <PhilanthropyG> Woolie.exe runs when Nier content detected.
[2:46:04] <+QueequegTheater> @Zundelle IT IS ONLY GIVING PAT AMMO. WOOLIE HAS LOST AMMO
[2:46:06] <datlambo458> The dwarves are Nier related
[2:46:08] <+PlaneWalkerDavid> The dwarves are the most NieR related its ever bee
[2:46:09] <%JaseAdrift> hows the final fantasy going chat?
[2:46:09] <A0N33> Pods > Potatos
[2:46:10] <dds333a> How remote, tho?
[2:46:11] <ThirdWelles> "There's too much talking in this raid" says man playing something written by Yoko Taro
[2:46:11] <%Akizea> @zundelle it's ONLY giving pat ammo
[2:46:13] <datlambo458> Noooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!
[2:46:13] <+CookieCutter007> PogChamp YOOOoo the stage play stream gonna be lit
[2:46:14] <cyberocelot32> Dwarves are directly nier related
[2:46:15] <vVAstrAVv> show no mercy pat
[2:46:15] <DedlokPM> but the dwarfs are important tho
[2:46:16] <speximillian> Understand the Dwarves were in Nier, they were just Stubbys
[2:46:16] <Arazien> If you want to Woolie, the Dwarves are SUPER important. Give it time
[2:46:18] <%nabby1> read this dictionary
[2:46:18] <+bluedude153> HE IS SO MAD
[2:46:24] <%ggbhtg> Woolie does not play FF14, he's not into MMOs at al, he's here to experience whatever Nier content there is. He's also leaning into the bit for sure. LUL
[2:46:25] <%Zundelle> nooo stop telling me the truth
[2:46:25] <dds333a> What if the dwarves are talking about Nier?
[2:46:25] <marshalmorphino22> What if this whole content slot was about finding out that 2B actually has a really good recipe for salad dressing?
[2:46:30] <ThirdWelles> GOING OUT OF HIS WAY to play something written by Yoko Taro, I should say
[2:46:30] <%call_me_comic> I prefer book to pod
[2:46:30] <dds333a> Kappa
[2:46:30] <KeiganOfAstora> haahaha this is funn
[2:46:35] <KeiganOfAstora> I just saw the thing on Twitter
[2:46:36] <datlambo458> The dwarves were being sat on by 2b
[2:46:39] <ArthurDoyleRPG> But lore....
[2:46:40] <+QueequegTheater> WITNESS ME
[2:46:40] <%Major_Lee_> The most malding
[2:46:42] <%derpumpkinking> I dont see woolie as necessarily annoyed. its more like he's begrudgingly learning and making sure he is definitely not interested in the game. The Nier stuff is just an excuse to do so.
[2:46:42] <%ggbhtg> POD OR BUST
[2:46:45] <penitentpendant> You need to be IN the factory
[2:46:46] <KeiganOfAstora> Boat?
[2:46:46] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[2:46:50] <+QueequegTheater> BAN THE CHAT TO PROGRESS THE GAME
[2:46:50] <%Akizea> if he skips the dwarves then there's no point in doing the quest lol
[2:46:52] <+snausages_> I mean I'm into ffxiv and nier and woolie's feelings here were exactly mine during this crossover.
[2:46:54] <+pupil31> He was gonna get shot
[2:46:59] <penitentpendant> To the 'corpse room'
[2:47:00] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[2:47:01] <Cubblesv2> "Silence" them potatoes
[2:47:03] <dbag202> "Not NieR related"
[2:47:05] <%Akizea> may as well skip the whole quest line lol
[2:47:05] <+Metballs> Just be a DNC
[2:47:06] <T_Sasquatch> I FUCKING hate having to type shit in quests

[2:47:30] <%gatorafan> daedra1DerpyTibs
[2:47:30] <datlambo458> Ummmm
[2:47:30] <Arazien> Woolie's gonna ignore the dwarves and wonder why he's super confused as this goes on
[2:47:30] <yuribo26> UNPLAYABLE
[2:47:30] <GuyNamedGatsby> Kinda
[2:47:30] <%KuroStardust> NOT WRONG
[2:47:31] <+mojopork4u> It's a good one
[2:47:31] <Fiendmaw> We know,Woolie
[2:47:31] <Solidnick18> yeah
[2:47:32] <penitentpendant> Nope. But they use the skeleton for another mount. Most people were saddened.
[2:47:33] <Alice_Lufenia> WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE YET
[2:47:33] <+Leftovermemes> but Gabriel is cool
[2:47:34] <%ZweihanderSteve> pod is a minion. the mount the the mech suit???
[2:47:34] <+Metballs> It's not over yet
[2:47:36] <+Metballs> There'
[2:47:37] <+xxx420stoat69xxx> the mount is coming!
[2:47:38] <%Garthunox> hard agree
[2:47:38] <%HollowedIdjit> there are other flight bots
[2:47:39] <zecht89> not even the heavy armor woolie
[2:47:40] <+snausages_> The fact we didn't get Grimoire Noir/Weiss glamours for SMN/SCH is another bummer
[2:47:41] <%ArkSeaside> we actually don't know yet
[2:47:41] <+gespenst25> WHY ISN'T THE POD A MOUNT
[2:47:42] <+mojopork4u> Gabriel is great
[2:47:42] <ThirdWelles> Gabriel is not a flight unit don't you DARE say "sort of"
[2:47:42] <%ConflagrationsGaming> THERE'S NO WEAPONS EITHER
[2:47:43] <PhazonSuited> you can get the gabriel
[2:47:43] <%Garthunox> but Gabriel is better
[2:47:47] <Riorii> The story is not finished
[2:47:48] <SomersaultJustice> OR DID THEY
[2:47:49] <@Solidus_113> yeah, no weapons eaither
[2:47:49] <+skyheys> BIG HEEL WOOLIE
[2:47:50] <@Solidus_113> shame
[2:47:52] <TheCrispyBoi> woolie is right
[2:47:52] <Lieutori> The weekly though
[2:47:53] <ThirdWelles> The weekly thing is still going on
[2:47:53] <jaysondeez> unless you are datamining, you can't say for sure
[2:47:53] <+Arnschen> Alliance raids also never have weapons or mounts
[2:47:53] <%Harthhammer> Type Zero mount is pretty nice tho
[2:47:54] <FunnyCrimes> still got 5.55 tho
[2:47:55] <%ConflagrationsGaming> i know its alliance. but the weapons woul dhave been so wonderful
[2:47:55] <+PlaneWalkerDavid> The NieR content's not done
[2:47:55] <%ArkSeaside> machine! Turn back now!
[2:47:57] <%Garthunox> the weeklies arent done yet tho
[2:47:57] <ThirdWelles> Series isn't over
[2:47:57] <+SunnyVarietyPack> I couldve swore there ive seen people with iut\
[2:47:58] <Ks201> Still to be determined if we get a flight suit
[2:47:58] <Solidnick18> blocked the shot
[2:47:58] <+mojopork4u> It does transform
[2:47:58] <amused_platypus> its possible we might get one from all the weekly quests
[2:47:59] <jaysondeez> the story is STILL not finished
[2:47:59] <%call_me_comic> NO LAYUPS NO DUNKS 3 POINTERS ONLY
[2:47:59] <%Garthunox> its possible
[2:47:59] <+Metballs> There's still another patch
[2:48:04] <RyuuAoi> That is for the spoilers, chat
[2:48:04] <%SveriSageAdvice> we got something similar enough, i have it outside
[2:48:06] <+QueequegTheater> IT DOES TRANSFORM
[2:48:08] <+Metballs> Not guaranteed, but there's a chance
[2:48:09] <+DreyfussFrost> Alliance raids have never awarded a mount, but yeah, they should make it as a very rare drop or a quest reward at the very end or something.
[2:48:10] <%Kain5707> Gabriel
[2:48:10] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Klefth
[2:48:11] <PenGia> Gabriel rules
[2:48:12] <T_Sasquatch> It's already in the game LUL
[2:48:12] <rosabellamelantha> GABRIEL IS COOLER
[2:48:14] <+theGhastlyVisage> wait who's at the helm?
[2:48:16] <ArthurDoyleRPG> Bro a mech is a mech though
[2:48:16] <+KawaiiJetty> I already have both Gabriels, still no nier flight unit sucks
[2:48:20] <vVAstrAVv> gabriel is good enough
[2:48:21] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus there's some waiting just outside the doors to the ruins
[2:48:21] <+Leftovermemes> id be down if they add it to mog station
[2:48:22] <+theGhastlyVisage> Minh or woolie?
[2:48:23] <T_Sasquatch> Gabriel alpha i think
[2:48:23] <ThirdWelles> Gabriel is not cooler shut the fuck up
[2:48:24] <KnightAsteran> oh did i miss the corpse room?
[2:48:24] <+jaymorayeel> This needs a character like Barret or Kano quipping as you travel along.
[2:48:25] <+notgarza> A grimoire minion would be cool 2
[2:48:26] <Klefth> And it transforms like a Macross mech
[2:48:29] <Ianrazz> Gabriel fucks, awesome mount
[2:48:32] <Hoodywolf> yeah you missed the corpse room
[2:48:41] <osaka_daioh> damn
[2:48:41] <marshalmorphino22> Someone get Woolie his jet pack already
[2:48:43] <+QueequegTheater> @KawaiiJetty wait, what's the second one? I thought it was just Gabriel-alpha
[2:48:45] <%Zundelle> potat
[2:48:45] <T_Sasquatch> I paid 1.5 mil gill for it LUL
[2:48:51] <Ks201> Yeah Gabriel is basically the ff version of the flight suit
[2:48:54] <+mikesapartment> nah, he is just small
[2:48:55] <PhazonSuited> @QueequegTheater the golden version from DR
[2:48:56] <Alice_Lufenia> sized for 24 players
[2:48:58] <Dragon_Batman> Well he is also really tiny
[2:48:58] <ThirdWelles> He super didn't miss the corpse you fucks
[2:48:58] <+bluedude153> No this is literally just a lalafell problem
[2:48:58] <dds333a> @arthurdoylerpg right, but it's not entirely just a mech, tho
[2:48:59] <+mojopork4u> lalas LUL
[2:48:59] <+pupil31> SMOL
[2:49:00] <+sonofthedeepsouth> SMOL
[2:49:02] <+KawaiiJetty> @queequegtheater the other is golden from DR
[2:49:03] <ClarentMordred> he's a potato woolie, theyre like 3 feet

[2:49:07] <PenGia> smol baby
[2:49:08] <%Garthunox> but 2b would be the same
[2:49:08] <nobody287> it's made for way more then 1 person
[2:49:08] <%Aeogard> LALAFELL LUL
[2:49:08] <+OblivionSword1> it's designed for 24 people
[2:49:09] <%ggbhtg> Sm0l
[2:49:12] <+snausages_> You need the camera zoomed out for mechanics visibility
[2:49:12] <%Kiso52> MAD BECAUSE SMOL. JEALOUS OF TALL
[2:49:13] <Hoodywolf> you take up more of the screen when you're not a potato
[2:49:13] <+MeyB_7> if 2b was actually in this game whe would be a giantess
[2:49:14] <+QueequegTheater> @PhazonSuited @kawaiiJetty oh cool didn't know about that
[2:49:21] <UnsteadyFunk> I play an Elezen walking around with the Dwarves just feels like babysitting
[2:49:22] <+jaymorayeel> They're a twink
[2:49:24] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Lalas are bullying
[2:49:25] <+mojopork4u> Yeah even big people have weird scaling
[2:49:25] <+HelloImTom08> MMO scale
[2:49:27] <%ArkSeaside> Baby goe sto timeout. For MURDER
[2:49:27] <Dragon_Batman> And he is also super tiny
[2:49:28] <Goraka91> @Kiso52 ANGRY
[2:49:29] <PhazonSuited> it's rare but you can buy it on the mb
[2:49:30] <+MeyB_7> like 2b would be the size of lady D
[2:49:30] <+DreyfussFrost> @WoolieVersus MMOs need cameras that can zoom way out so you have environmental awareness in large arenas, yeah.
[2:49:31] <ThirdWelles> Yeah he TOTALLY missed this corpse room right here
[2:49:31] <+Conzanagi> You'll need the 95% for all the shit some bosses throw at you
[2:49:32] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Bully every Lala
[2:49:34] <%Mathochism> Imagine playing a Lala when you can play big daddy Hrothgar.
[2:49:35] <ThirdWelles> chat
[2:49:36] <+mojopork4u> If you have a tall character it's even more weird
[2:49:38] <exnuart> its very theme park
[2:49:38] <PenGia> Lalafell master race
[2:49:40] <%Kiso52> @Goraka91 my bad haha
[2:49:43] <Alice_Lufenia> there are interiors that are smaller scaled and they're GARBAGE to navigate
[2:49:45] <+Ilpala> "Anogg get the FUCK over here"
[2:49:48] <ThirdWelles> Lalafel are trash and people who play them smell
[2:49:49] <%Zundelle> even in the original nier automata the game would want to allow space for big dumb cool combat
[2:49:55] <%HollowedIdjit> i play a Male Auri. The only thing taller than me are max heigh viera
[2:49:57] <42nfl19> Oh I found the mount that can seat 8, the Lunar Whale
[2:49:59] <Goraka91> @Kiso52 Oh no that's what he says next LUL
[2:50:06] <JanusII> Wait, chat was saying he missed this? We've been here twice now.

[2:50:07] <%HollowedIdjit> and I think Roes?
[2:50:08] <%ArkSeaside> listen I grew up with SNES final fantasies, everyone looked like a Lalafel there
[2:50:12] <+ArsCaelia> love the corpse room behbeh
[2:50:12] <+QueequegTheater> TINY IS MAD
[2:50:13] <iosephe> Lalas should be replaced by male viera and female hrothgar
[2:50:22] <$StaceMcGate> PopCorn
[2:50:25] <ScionOfFlame> Male Roes at max are taller than max Auri, yeah.

[2:51:24] <TigerClaws12> 9S hit the emergency meeting button
[2:51:25] <+FrostedZaibatsu> @yuribo26 sounds mad racist

[3:06:58] <dds333a> But yeah, early pulls can still happen
[3:07:01] <Zebroneath> if this wasn't stream prepped, there'd be asshole doing whatever
[3:07:03] <%dios_happy_hour> yes
[3:07:11] <%SveriSageAdvice> his high jump is Macro'd because it makes it easier on him @czeekytv
[3:07:14] <RyuuAoi> Basically get on your shit or these MFERS gonna kick you
[3:07:16] <%czeekytv> wait wait why are Minh's combo skills macro'ed??
[3:07:17] <%Chichen> @WoolieVersus it's being controlled by one of the white androids
[3:07:24] <+snausages_> grandma TearGlove
[3:07:28] <EvanDude47> 813p was one of the people on the cliff that minh says wasn't characters
[3:07:29] <+Graxe_> Piloted by 813P
[3:07:29] <penitentpendant> She's not here
[3:07:30] <FennecZephyr> Is that thing a flower
[3:07:30] <%jepupu> She's flying.
[3:07:30] <+Arnschen> @WoolieVersus That is one of the white androids that you saw earlier
[3:07:31] <+Docblargle> 2B isn't in the fight Minh
[3:07:31] <TheYellowcouch> you should definitely look up who 813P is
[3:07:32] <+Dwarven_Gaming> ???
[3:07:33] <umbraawitch> @Zebroneath there would definitely be a tank fucking up the 903p fight
[3:07:38] <TheYellowcouch> cause you know her already
[3:07:39] <%SveriSageAdvice> also yeah Minh is having to deal with talking and doing raid mechanics simultaneously, it's difficult to do both lol
[3:07:40] <%ggbhtg> @czeekytv Minh doesnt play optimally (reeee)
[3:07:46] <Applecannon63> 2B is flying
[3:07:51] <penitentpendant> You meet up with 2B later in the raid. She won't be present until the final boss.
[3:07:52] <%ggbhtg> also on his alt account
[3:07:52] <duchessdynamic> You do kind of have to do it

[3:08:00] <+mikesapartment> the white androids are all labeled "P" units
[3:08:00] <PinkSocks> Yeah that's one of them
[3:08:02] <PhazonSuited> that is one of them
[3:08:04] <%czeekytv> If the macro is just 15 lines of executing the action then what's the point, that's my question
[3:08:04] <2DSuperiority> white os P
[3:08:05] <Alice_Lufenia> All the XXP are the white androids
[3:08:05] <LaughingCatt> yup, its being piloted by one of them
[3:08:05] <+GrandHound> They're just the P
[3:08:05] <+Metballs> Minh...
[3:08:06] <+QueequegTheater> P stands for White obviously Kappa
[3:08:07] <+caramelatte1> P series
[3:08:10] <Neoripo> Yes
[3:08:12] <zecht89> The P stands for Puppet BTW.

[3:19:42] <+gespenst25> Design it upirself :P
[3:19:48] <neostria> Woolie is disgusted by these MMO freaks
[3:19:49] <+pissdegaulle> that's why they let you customize it a lot
[3:19:50] <+CookieCutter007> hours of hud edits
[3:19:51] <Hoodywolf> this is entirely custom, this is just the way mihn wants to see his game lmao
[3:19:52] <+KawaiiJetty> It's ok this is just ffxiv simulation
[3:19:53] <+bladeworksmaster> I have won the Yoko Taro Award before lol
[3:19:54] <+pupil31> Ragnarok Online is clean Kreygasm
[3:19:54] <Riorii> you kinda have to make it yourself in ff14
[3:19:56] <Klefth> Most people don't use GIGANTIC hotbars like this, though...
[3:19:57] <nobody287> that 's why customizing exists
[3:19:59] <+Masked_Hero_Lucky> The HUD for this game is entirely customizable
[3:20:00] <Alice_Lufenia> I love you can fully customize :)
[3:20:02] <VidulaSaix> Nah you can make a really nice one if you spend time with it
[3:20:09] <+bladeworksmaster> it was cause I didn’t know nothing
[3:20:25] <+Kavtech> My hud takes up like, 10-15% of my screen
[3:20:26] <jaysondeez> someone people have their minimap in the middle of their hotbars to keep tract of map
[3:20:27] <PenGia> yeah like mine is way smaller and only buffs I care about
[3:20:36] <+Arnschen> Nah, a lot of HUDs are pretty streamlined
[3:20:37] <Nekros4442> Theres a good reason whybthe ui is super customizable
[3:20:38] <VidulaSaix> It may look messy to a non MMO player but a lot of the time, you wont even look at some of the stuff
[3:20:38] <+QueequegTheater> @VidulaSaix at a point there just becomes too much information to not block big parts of the screen

[3:20:55] <+ConLin_Arts_> Nier Standard
[3:20:55] <Louie_Salmon> It also depends on whether they're a healer, healers need much more info
[3:20:56] <+mojopork4u> @WoolieVersus Pay attention to this part

[3:22:22] <$Noponis> woolie you have to SEE the hud you know
[3:22:24] <+snausages_> you need the info close at hand, espeically if healer
[3:22:24] <%Javaa01> That is probably the worst idea ive ever heard
[3:22:25] <+pissdegaulle> you can just hide the hud
[3:22:25] <vVAstrAVv> thats insanity
[3:22:25] <+caramelatte1> You need to clearly see that ui

[3:22:35] <Klefth> No two people have the exact same UI setup

[3:28:40] <OkamiDude15> @ChrisAlgoo raids come in different difficulties savage being one of them
[3:28:41] <Archmortal> I believe there IS a mechanic where jumping avoids it, but there's only like one

[3:28:48] <ClarentMordred> jumping does affect certain mechanics but not these
[3:28:49] <vVAstrAVv> FLOOR TANK lol
[3:28:49] <Klefth> That was a tank buster
[3:28:51] <ArthurDoyleRPG> Floor Tank
[3:28:52] <T_Sasquatch> @ChrisAlgoo basically the hardest content in the game with bullshit mechanics
[3:28:53] <+DNCDoes> Floor tank PogChamp
[3:28:54] <VidulaSaix> Typical DRG Kappa
[3:28:56] <+symphonicsuplex> always the drgs i s2g
[3:28:58] <DatAsuna> cleave is basically a tankbuster shape
[3:28:59] <Gloraxxp> @QueequegTheater LUL LUL
[3:29:02] <penitentpendant> Specifically: A Line Tankbuster. It hits the tank and everything in front of and behind it
[3:29:05] <Irb11> jumping also counts as movement for freeze mechanics
[3:29:11] <Alice_Lufenia> hurtbox was a big Rectangle for that attack
[3:29:11] <FunnyCrimes> as the old MMO saying goes: "There's two kinds of attacks: ones that are lethal, and ones that are the healer's problem."
[3:29:13] <Ifitsleeps> Woolie is playing ff14?!
[3:29:16] <+Kaask> no not at all
[3:29:16] <+ChrisAlgoo> the human brain only has enough room for sick DPS combos
[3:29:17] <speximillian> Dragoon main: “Jumping is pointless”
[3:29:23] <vVAstrAVv> only for lalas
[3:29:23] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:29:23] <+Kaask> its literally just the center of your characters own circle
[3:29:24] <khazdee> player hitboxes are literally 1 pixel wide
[3:29:26] <+QueequegTheater> Your own hurtbox is basically just a cylinder @WoolieVersus
[3:29:27] <+Kavtech> @Ifitsleeps Nope. Just watchign the Nier Raids.
[3:29:32] <+walternatorz> the player hitbox is a single pixel centered on your character, no body parts
[3:29:35] <%zacyzacy> is that true about freeze?
[3:29:41] <vVAstrAVv> bigger chars have the same hitbox
[3:29:43] <seer0ftime> clutch
[3:29:46] <PenGia> ayyy beat the snapshot

[3:29:51] <PhazonSuited> @zacyzacy yes, it works in sos
[3:29:51] <Neoripo> No, if the center of the player is on AoE you get hit, if not you don't
[3:29:52] <+Maswrath> Your characters hurtbox for aoes is like 1 pixel

[3:32:57] <jaysondeez> ninja
[3:32:57] <+Veraverse> Fortress of Lies is so good
[3:32:59] <VidulaSaix> No, Ninja move slightly faster
[3:33:00] <StridentSong> Agree to disagree
[3:33:01] <%CodenameChaz> Ninjas have a faster movement speed
[3:33:01] <PhazonSuited> ninja and monk go 5% faster
[3:33:02] <+poysendemon> ninjas move faster
[3:33:04] <+OblivionSword1> I think ninja is faster
[3:33:05] <jaysondeez> ninja is slightly faster
[3:33:05] <%MisterRockett> Ninjas move LITTLE bit ffaster.
[3:33:05] <%commanderclaw> NIN and MNK go faster
[3:33:06] <+Arnschen> Ninjas move slightly faster
[3:33:07] <+notgarza> As SMN I just save Phoenix for this part
[3:33:07] <+gespenst25> ninja's move faster
[3:33:08] <+Kaask> ninjas have a feat to run faster
[3:33:10] <penitentpendant> Except for NIN, they have a 10% speed buff as a passive
[3:33:13] <%zacyzacy> ninjas are faster
[3:33:13] <SomersaultJustice> ninjas move faster
[3:33:14] <shinji_ifrit> Ninja and Monk are faster
[3:33:15] <+Kaask> monk has an ability, fist of wind, to run faster
[3:33:19] <iosephe> Peloton is great
[3:33:19] <%HeroToxiko> haste beybeeeee
[3:33:19] <GhostPyre> pleoton doesnt work in combat though
[3:33:21] <+pissdegaulle> outside of combat
[3:33:22] <Neoripo> Yes unless buffed or running
[3:33:24] <amused_platypus> ninja and monke can move fast
[3:33:24] <+QueequegTheater> NIN and MNK are faster
[3:33:25] <+terry_quest> cant belive moth died
[3:33:26] <samuraicaveman> but not during fights
[3:33:28] <+genowyn> Ninjas run faster
[3:33:29] <+Metballs> Ninja is passive faster
[3:33:30] <MKII> dancer has a short ranged dash
[3:33:30] <BlueVexer> Ninjas have higher base movement speed, monk can increase theirs with a stance, range DPS can increase base speed.
[3:33:32] <ArthurDoyleRPG> Not in battle
[3:33:32] <VidulaSaix> Ninja standard is slightly quicker
[3:33:34] <%0rond> NIN has a passive +5% move speed
[3:33:35] <+Mondeiya> nin walks faster
[3:33:35] <vVAstrAVv> some classes are faster but its by like 5 percent
[3:33:36] <+ChrisAlgoo> fuckin' love when someone has peloton
[3:33:37] <stormhawk9891> Moth died again
[3:33:39] <Alice_Lufenia> lala and roe run same speed, yep
[3:33:41] <+Tarviti> Ninja have faster passive speed
[3:33:47] <+QueequegTheater> So Lalas run stupid fast and Roegadyn are slow and lumbering
[3:33:52] <grbunnys> Ninja can naruto run at high speed
[3:33:52] <StencilOST> FEET
[3:33:53] <VidulaSaix> You can also use Sprint to move quicker
[3:33:55] <jaysondeez> there are heavy mechanics based around that
[3:33:57] <FunnyCrimes> ninja have a passive that increases movement speed
[3:33:57] <seer0ftime> that's why god gave some of us gap closers
[3:33:58] <penitentpendant> 2B returns!
[3:33:59] <@Solidus_113> so yeah, just in the alien ship for some reason
[3:33:59] <mudapersona> its more reaction time than speed
[3:34:00] <Goraka91> Universal movement speed ye, most classes have a movement ability
[3:34:01] <jaysondeez> if you get hit you get slowed and you can
[3:34:01] <%CodenameChaz> And worse case scenario there's a cooldown you can pop to run faster
[3:34:05] <jaysondeez> can't dodge then
[3:34:12] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @BlueVexer
[3:34:13] <VidulaSaix> Alien Ship
[3:34:14] <%HollowedIdjit> Ninja has a 10% increase to speed

[3:41:13] <Hoodywolf> "for some reason you wanna maximize your dps" you always wanna do that lol
[3:41:15] <Srthunda> some people try their best to cut it real close
[3:41:24] <+Veraverse> We'll never know
[3:41:26] <penitentpendant> Uptime
[3:41:28] <mudapersona> why was that tank buster so on beat lol
[3:41:30] <Alice_Lufenia> Vuln stacks? Nah DPS Uptime markers!
[3:41:31] <+walternatorz> healers adjust
[3:41:34] <gunstars20> MUH DPSS
[3:41:37] <+Mendin> "Disus auras yeilus vigan / Nesti aurei shekum Ies"
[3:41:41] <majindusto> This song is also in automata when you fight the giant whale goliath machine
[3:41:42] <+Graxe_> Reproduce
[3:41:48] <+TombstoneTTromboners> the ultimate dps loss is death
[3:41:49] <OkamiDude15> @mudapersona its designed that way woolieMIRIN
[3:41:50] <+mojopork4u> "for some reason" makes sense, baby raids are a nice casual fun break.
[3:41:51] <penitentpendant> By the same token: Dead DPS Don't
[3:41:57] <Goraka91> If you play too defensive you won't get the SSS
[3:41:57] <Archmortal> I loved the dps discourse during Savage Alex 1
[3:41:57] <Slim_Lipid> offense, woolie's kryptonite
[3:41:58] <+bladeworksmaster> I do wish they could’ve gotten Kira Buckland in to do some creepy legion voice
[3:41:58] <+Hayajin_> uptime strats
[3:42:03] <FunnyCrimes> there are only two kinds of aoes: lethal ones, and ones that are the healer's problem
[3:42:05] <%ChoculaUltra> rip
[3:42:06] <PhazonSuited> snapshotting LUL
[3:42:07] <+bladeworksmaster> that would’ve been so sick
[3:42:13] <2Bs_USB_port> SourPls
[3:42:17] <+QueequegTheater> Dragoon is a weird one since they don't really have a huge single hit. Full thrust is good but it's not crazy, and most of DRG's extra damage comes from their metric fuckton of OCGDs
[3:42:17] <@Solidus_113> yep
[3:42:18] <odiz395> they pull a robot chitti
[3:42:19] <VidulaSaix> It's not as complicated as it sounds though Woolie. Keep in mind that from level 1 to leve 80 where Minh is now you learn these things over time and it becomes kind of second nature
[3:42:19] <Darksword64> Minh don’t wanna hit us with the monkaTOS ACT / PARSING
[3:42:19] <+Finaldragoon> Mothman keeps dying Kappa
[3:42:22] <%fetrigon> ye

[3:42:40] <+Tucker0603> YES
[3:42:40] <dagreenpillow> mothman loves death
[3:42:48] <+xxx420stoat69xxx> can we skip this and get bacl to the dwarves please?
[3:42:50] <Lieutori> Damn, this is dying so fast since I last did this raid
[3:42:52] <Archmortal> So uh... did Minh not know about FFXIV really fucking hating when you stream the chat box?
[3:42:53] <+thesw1tch> quick question chat? how spoiler heavy is this for nier automata?
[3:42:56] <winner_92> guys i dont know whats happening why does it say Tokimeki Memorial onscreen

[3:43:58] <Archmortal> @Floofiie nah, FFXIV streamers typically have to cover the chat box because it's ban-able in-game
[3:44:00] <penitentpendant> Minh, look at the corners
[3:44:08] <VidulaSaix> @Archmortal What the actual hell are you talking about lmao
[3:44:11] <winner_92> @winner_92 oh ok thx
[3:44:17] <Darksword64> @archmortal not really ban able, more of a courtesy thing.
[3:44:18] <VidulaSaix> I dunno who told you that but thats super not true
[3:44:21] <speximillian> Balls exposed in front of 2000+ people
[3:44:28] <%QuadraticGravity> @Archmortal It's never been bannable, people just do it for the privacy of party members
[3:44:28] <+valiard> @theswitch not really imo
[3:44:29] <+QueequegTheater> 1600
[3:44:30] <+Kavtech> Can Mihn angle his camera up a bit in the options menu?
[3:44:31] <Dave_VD> All I wanna do ~ is see you turn into ~ a giant woman
[3:44:33] <+Veraverse> Yooo Devils Never Cry playing Jebaited
[3:44:36] <+projectmanatees> @archmortal it’s a private pre set run so all known it’s a stream
[3:44:38] <LeiaSkynoober> @Archmortal There are no randoms, he also adjusted it so he won't see randoms talk
[3:44:53] <@Solidus_113> nasty
[3:44:54] <%Tenchi_G> I cant believe Woolie is playing FF14 woolieSHOOK
[3:44:55] <Floofiie> Yeah everyone consented to it on reddit i believe

[3:45:13] <dds333a> This was super cool "body horror"
[3:45:13] <Darksword64> TBH you chat cover because you don’t want half of what Limsa say chat will put in there to be visible on stream
[3:45:17] <%Aeogard> lul get your tomes woolie!
[3:45:19] <%Lion_kun> Only one more raid lol
[3:45:21] <+Veraverse> GIVE ME THE LOOT
[3:45:26] <+valiard> Its all contextual? Like it does not speak on plot directly
[3:45:26] <%SkellyVee> peachmilkyHype
[3:45:35] <VidulaSaix> Yeah people cover chat just cause they dont wanna share it. It has nothing to do with being agains ToS LUL
[3:45:37] <+FrostedZaibatsu> This was the 2nd raid right?

[3:46:53] <%ConflagrationsGaming> Honestly I'm glad I caught this stream at all, this is awesome

[3:46:54] <JanusII> Yeah this is normal.
[3:46:54] <%Axle13j> Don't trip yo
[3:46:54] <+skyheys> ff14 has rewards for replaying content
[3:46:55] <%SkellyVee> waoSALUTE
[3:46:56] <+terry_quest> i mean im expecting to get paid for this LUL
[3:46:56] <%SuperBloodWolfMoon> this is normal and good
[3:46:58] <Solidnick18> i'd like to eat soon yeah
[3:46:58] <PhilanthropyG> for normal raid stuff, everyone starts at the dungeon, so its a much shorter thing to do.
[3:46:58] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Woolie you're more important than them, value yourself higher
[3:46:58] <+ClericOfSparda> Yeah this is normal for FF folks
[3:46:59] <penitentpendant> Get to rub this in Pat's face next podcast
[3:47:00] <Felto3> most ff14 players are chill, especially for first timers
[3:47:01] <%justcallmebobplease> Woolie, you should MMO enough to at least get what it be.
[3:47:01] <Louie_Salmon> They play an MMO, they have nothing better to do
[3:47:02] <beautyfulman> @WoolieVersus You gotta remember, there is benefit for them to be doing this, you upgrade gear with the stuff you get from here
[3:47:03] <Hammatime8> If you're into it, that's cool. If you're not into it, that's cool too.
[3:47:05] <+FrostedZaibatsu> Naw thats just how MMOs work
[3:47:05] <Darksword64> @mrp33ps Im aware, but the individual saying its nessecary for privacy reasons is super wrong
[3:47:06] <Edajos> !uptime
[3:47:06] <%ConflagrationsGaming> And i'm glad that u get to join in and see it too !
[3:47:06] <@Moobot> @Edajos WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 56 minutes
[3:47:07] <%Garthunox> @WoolieVersus i was just genuinely curious earlier about watching vids, i didnt mean anything bad by it btw
[3:47:08] <Archmortal> @VidulaSaix The most recent one I saw bring it up was XenosysVex. Maybe I misunderstood it every time?
[3:47:08] <marshalmorphino22> The least people can do for the number 1 ff14 streamer
[3:47:10] <+spartan_ermine> mmo players time has no value
[3:47:16] <speximillian> People don’t play MMOs because they care about wasting time
[3:47:19] <%Lion_kun> Woolie, you have 1500+ viewers
[3:47:20] <Dragon_Batman> It's nice you and Minh are doing this
[3:47:20] <+Mindtrick_Matt> Some days all I do is sit outside the FC house lol
[3:47:23] <dds333a> @marshalmorphino22 CarlSmile CarlSmile CarlSmile
[3:47:24] <+ClericOfSparda> I love running through stuff like this with people
[3:47:24] <+Maswrath> Thinking about how much you want to **** this game Woolie?
[3:47:26] <Hammatime8> I really don't think this is the sort of thing I could get into tho
[3:47:26] <DatAsuna> o7
[3:47:28] <+seoliart> Woolie the #1 FF14 streamer
[3:47:29] <Irb11> ffxiv is mostly in a content drought atm, they probably aren't busy
[3:47:36] <+TenKaiHunter> Anytime spent playing this game is time well spent, no matter how much we say we hate it.
[3:47:38] <+678saintglock> everybody's like that, plus its you everybody wants to interact with their favorite streamer in like any way
[3:47:40] <exnuart> ffxiv is very themeparky, people tend to sit around all the time
[3:47:41] <capten31> hey woolie just wanted to say thank you for all the videos keep on being awesome
[3:47:43] <+QueequegTheater> ENJOY THE DWARVES

[3:47:51] <%Chichen> You'll retire here someday
[3:47:51] <%CodenameChaz> Oh and in case you missed it, that boss theme was "Torn From the Heavens/Dark Colossus Destroys All (Medley)"
[3:47:51] <VidulaSaix> @Archmortal Xeno hides his chat much like Arth does because if one of their viewers joins a party and says some sketchy shit then THAT can get them in trouble. It has nothing to do with the chat itself
[3:47:53] <%Javaa01> This is not untrue
[3:47:53] <ScionOfFlame> FF14 is where FGC players just GO, dude.

[3:53:05] <+zepelinnn1> @Floofiie people that bring that up are also dumb, because he said he only does that with his friends to make a full PT
[3:53:05] <penitentpendant> There is... SO much triple triad in FF14
[3:53:09] <PhilanthropyG> Triple Triad is the hook
[3:53:10] <%juiceboxhero116> Gotta head out for work, Thank you Woolie and Minh for all the laughs today! woolieYE
[3:53:12] <dds333a> Minh's other other chick was a Lancer
[3:53:15] <+QueequegTheater> there are so many cards
[3:53:17] <cherrycottontail> I remember that video
[3:53:21] <+Maswrath> Triple triad is in the game
[3:53:21] <%radregice> wait i just said tiers instead of tears I ruined it
[3:53:27] <+KawaiiJetty> so many freaking cards
[3:53:33] <+paladinstarbuster> You said INFINITE

[3:53:37] <+Mictlan93> My other car is a lancer
[3:53:41] <LordOfThePoultry> you said infinity
[3:53:42] <speximillian> Why *is* there no Triple Triad going on? The Tidus Cup is happening over in the Gold Saucer
[3:53:43] <amused_platypus> triple triad becomes crazy so many people that you can swindle their best cards

[3:54:30] <Eustacecervidae> They say in Drakengard 3 that their world is a crown of thorns or something like this, suffering is infinite and the ending of Automata is maybe the end of the loop and the start of a hopeful reality
[3:54:34] <%saiko2208> I got into 14 a year and a half ago because of the Nier content. It was totally worth it lol
[3:54:36] <%QuadraticGravity> It's alright, I'm just vibin' <3
[3:54:41] <+QueequegTheater> @ITechedDat you can buy a story skip if you really just want to hit the newest expansion
[3:54:47] <%Chichen> it has an important description
[3:54:47] <+Maswrath> Endwalker, our next expansion, seems to be heavily inspired by ff4
[3:54:51] <%HeroToxiko> Woolie said infinite permutations of the suffering, permutations are not a measurement of time chat

[3:56:27] <Eustacecervidae> @Tarviti they're not, all of the games DG 1 and 3, Replicant and Automata all share the same universe and are locked in a time loop of pain and suffering
[3:56:30] <PhilanthropyG> that guy got blown up on stream
[3:56:36] <@Solidus_113> The Nier Raid outfits are closer to vergil once you paint it blue
[3:56:46] <Goraka91> Lali-ho

[3:57:13] <+QueequegTheater> @Tarviti Nier and Nier Automata are explicitly sequels to Drakengard 1/3
[3:57:27] <dds333a> Not at all, yeah
[3:57:31] <+QueequegTheater> MMOs are meant to be played up close
[3:57:31] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:57:33] <Klefth> You absolutely can, but not everyone uses GIGANTIC hotbars like Minh is rn... lol
[3:57:35] <+Tarviti> @Eustacecervidae Same multiverse, that multiverse also includes SC and FF
[3:57:38] <jackythefrost> Story skipping is the worst possible thing you can do in XIV, 95% of the dev time goes into the story and its the main reason to play the game
[3:57:52] <@Solidus_113> usaully 6 feet
[3:57:57] <jackythefrost> Its an FF game first and an MMO second
[3:58:03] <42nfl19> Does Minh have the costumes unlocked on his main? He should show them off after the last raid.
[3:58:06] <+TombstoneTTromboners> ANOGG WHAT UP
[3:58:10] <+QueequegTheater> @jackythefrost some people just want to raid
[3:58:17] <ArthurDoyleRPG> Social distance from your TV doodLUL
[3:58:19] <+QueequegTheater> That's fine, everyone is different
[3:58:20] <OneThousandTomatoes> i use big hotbars when I'm using a tv and sitting 10 ft away
[3:58:23] <+ChrisAlgoo> yeahh music
[3:58:27] <Irb11> nah I'd skip arr every day of the week
[3:58:41] <DatAsuna> Don't say the names xD
[3:58:43] <jackythefrost> 4 raids every 6 months really isnt worth it imo @QueequegTheater
[3:58:45] <Darksword64> TBF you can skim read ARR and not miss out on much. As someone who’s gone through multipule times, you only pick up on some threads on a replay, given how heavy the game hit with exposition on the first run through
[3:58:49] <dds333a> Dramatic standing
[3:58:50] <+Tarviti> @QueequegTheater Oh absolutely, but we know the Queenbeast jumped through a portal to a new universe in ending E, the quote was specifically about the world of Drakengard
[3:58:54] <+exbeau> ff14 story is good but there's lot of dialogue fillers
[3:58:56] <Alice_Lufenia> the game also told you content and rewards are same
[3:59:11] <%ArkSeaside> aight I gotta go eat have fun with the last raid, and thanks for tagging us in
[3:59:18] <ArthurDoyleRPG> "wrong"
[3:59:18] <+MightyDuckShoes> dear God as soon as I get here I see a wall of text going on about this MMO's "plot" SuperVinlin Please
[3:59:20] <cherrycottontail> meaningful choices in games? Never
[3:59:22] <amused_platypus> kupo as a dialogue option is fun
[3:59:23] <+ChrisAlgoo> Ending F: [F]inal Fantasy
[3:59:30] <%nabby1> is this the end of the raid?
[3:59:32] <+FrostedZaibatsu> So 2B is Goku
[3:59:39] <Fiendmaw> "Dialogue fillers" that flesh out the world and characters you inhabit for ours on end? Not sure if that's a downside.
[3:59:45] <%Chichen> Woolie said something nice about the dwarves PogChamp
[3:59:48] <%Aeogard> @Tarviti You could argue that it was actually jsut the future, or the past, since a lot of fan theories involve cyclical timelines about the series.
[3:59:49] <+QueequegTheater> @jackythefrost to you, it takes like 100 runs of each Savage for everyone to get their rewards, that's up to 8 multi-hour sessions each
[3:59:49] <penitentpendant> @nabby1 Ending part of Raid 2 of 3

[4:00:16] <+exbeau> hmmm, maybe dialogue filler is the wrong phrase, there's lot of dialogue fluff, it's very wordy when they can reduce the dialogue a lot
[4:00:20] <%deadbeat34> 2P-Puppet
[4:00:23] <LeiaSkynoober> @MightyDuckShoes You don't understand, the story is legitimately great for big spoiler reasons
[4:00:24] <penitentpendant> "He was like this when we found him!"
[4:00:28] <+Maswrath> Yknow aliens, like dragons
[4:00:32] <+exbeau> feels like padding to make the content feel longer
[4:00:33] <+TombstoneTTromboners> 2B must be so confused being surrounded by all these very tiny people
[4:00:35] <brachydios777> Mass produced Adam and Eve like machines
[4:00:36] <Darksword64> @mightyduckshoes you’d be surprised how much of a final fantasy game this really is, big reason its be acclaimed as the best FF in a while kareth1Sip
[4:00:38] <Tracazoid> "I'd like to see him"- 2E said, as everyone else was unaware
[4:00:39] <SmartAssPawn089> DAMN wtf did I miss? Watching this VOD later

[4:00:55] <dds333a> Hell, anything foreign enough is an alien
[4:00:56] <pmmori> there will be a quest
[4:00:56] <+notgarza> Eating them
[4:00:57] <+Arnschen> There is one
[4:00:58] <+DreyfussFrost> There will be another quest.
[4:00:58] <+sevorai> i wouldn't even call that dialogue fluff. I think it adds character tbh
[4:01:01] <Zeif00> quest
[4:01:02] <penitentpendant> You have the notes on the phones, do the quest
[4:01:02] <%deejay782> wait the aliens are dragons???
[4:01:02] <AzureSynesthesia> there is a quest
[4:01:04] <mr_red117> quest later\
[4:01:11] <+exbeau> @Clundy essentially
[4:01:18] <gmbt21xd> yeah @deejay782
[4:01:21] <+Maswrath> There is a quest
[4:01:22] <dds333a> Pulp sci fantasy novels had this in spades
[4:01:37] <+TombstoneTTromboners> @deejay782 yeah midgardsormir came from way out in space being chased by omega and ended up in ffxiv world with all his babies
[4:01:42] <+DreyfussFrost> @WoolieVersus Remember for later: this zone also has 11. 3 of them are in the command room and are easy to miss, so explore the command room thoroughly.
[4:01:44] <Neoripo> P for Panasonic
[4:01:46] <+Nobrev> P is for panasonic
[4:01:46] <gmbt21xd> wait Mihn's a dragoon?
[4:01:48] <jackythefrost> Mainly cause XIV is localized in modern English which in general is a lot more wordy
[4:01:54] <+xp194> P for Parrot
[4:02:01] <dds333a> @gmbt21xd ye
[4:02:02] <DennisStreaming> P for Alien
[4:02:06] <gmbt21xd> nice
[4:02:08] <%zacyzacy> no
[4:02:10] <+TombstoneTTromboners> no
[4:02:11] <+ClericOfSparda> Probably
[4:02:11] <@Solidus_113> burnout?
[4:02:11] <%fetrigon> TIME MANAGEMENT
[4:02:13] <Alice_Lufenia> burnout
[4:02:13] <Louie_Salmon> There's a free trial up to 60 right now, so no problem!
[4:02:14] <Carlioo> FOMO?
[4:02:14] <penitentpendant> Sunk Cost Fallacy?
[4:02:15] <Applecannon63> P is Strand
[4:02:15] <%dios_happy_hour> its the same as netflix
[4:02:16] <jackythefrost> no
[4:02:16] <enZymeth> Sunk cost
[4:02:17] <%DashXero> The name for that is "wasting money."
[4:02:18] <%Aeogard> It's "not playing the game"
[4:02:18] <%DrJamesWoods> I pay for a lot of games I don't play
[4:02:18] <+mikesapartment> subscriber guilt
[4:02:19] <+Arnschen> Not really?
[4:02:19] <ReiRyghts1> burnout
[4:02:19] <+QueequegTheater> Bad time management
[4:02:19] <%dios_happy_hour> or any sub
[4:02:19] <+caramelatte1> You being dumb for not playing what you paid for
[4:02:20] <%KuroStardust> Burnout?
[4:02:20] <PhilanthropyG> no, that happens
[4:02:21] <DSD24> Buyers Remorse?
[4:02:21] <OneThousandTomatoes> ffxiv isnt the type of game you need to play a lot unless you are a completionist
[4:02:21] <+ClericOfSparda> it happens
[4:02:22] <+Tarviti> @Aeogard It's kinda hard to believe that timelines are cyclical when so many of them just end up with 0 chance of anything happening
[4:02:22] <Clundy> Isn’t that just Fomo
[4:02:22] <%MisterRockett> Buyer's Remorse?
[4:02:23] <+RyTYoung> That's me NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[4:02:24] <Agami23> not everyone feels that
[4:02:24] <+MTLxSpider> POTMONSTER
[4:02:25] <+AugustRei> i feel like most people who play ffxiv play it a lot
[4:02:26] <Ecliptic_Origins> sunken cost fallacy?
[4:02:27] <mr_red117> just you?
[4:02:28] <+MugenSandan> It's mostly you
[4:02:29] <+QueequegTheater> Caveat Emptor
[4:02:30] <PhilanthropyG> Grind Fatigue
[4:02:31] <T_Sasquatch> You don't do that , that's the name
[4:02:34] <speximillian> If I get 12 hours in over a month I’m happy
[4:02:34] <doggieo> I get it
[4:02:34] <ArthurDoyleRPG> Uh
[4:02:35] <@Solidus_113> yeah Buyers remorse could be it
[4:02:36] <%SaltDuhWound> *laughs in vacation pause*
[4:02:37] <FennecZephyr> Just unsub and resub when there's more content. It's fine, they account for that in their business model
[4:02:37] <+Maswrath> The feeling of wasted money
[4:02:40] <beautyfulman> @WoolieVersus The head dev has gone on record saying he would want people to unsub to XIV if they don't play it enough
[4:02:40] <%fetrigon> MANAGE YOUR TIME
[4:02:44] <+MeyB_7> i know that feel
[4:02:45] <aqua_mashu> I just like having access to the world
[4:02:46] <+Renkaru> Id probably play this if didn't have a monthly sub
[4:02:47] <+MTLxSpider> they just call it a burnout usually.
[4:02:47] <+FrostedZaibatsu> Its like $20 a year tho
[4:02:52] <Alice_Lufenia> FFXIV devs acknoweldge that people take breaks
[4:02:52] <+terry_quest> its basically just burning money
[4:02:53] <Ecliptic_Origins> Buyers remorse i guess
[4:02:55] <+paladinstarbuster> LOL
[4:02:55] <Dragon_Batman> I mean that's just a normal thing for every subscription service
[4:02:56] <rReizs> fire up that xbox
[4:02:57] <%dios_happy_hour> the free trial goes to the end of the first expansion !
[4:03:00] <+Basilias_Maximus> Xbox live definitely has that feeling.
[4:03:01] <jaysondeez> its pretty cheap for a year
[4:03:02] <ScionOfFlame> TRY IT, WOOLIE. DO IT.
[4:03:03] <%Aeogard> @Tarviti I mean, I get what you mean, but so many of them lead into other things we don't see in the mainline games either. But there's enough things to think about...
[4:03:04] <T_Sasquatch> I don't do that ever LUL
[4:03:05] <%fetrigon> but yeah buyers remorse fucking sucks NotLikeThis
[4:03:06] <DeathByPoke7> I unsubbed to Nintendo for that reason
[4:03:06] <DatAsuna> I wish it was 1-2 dollars lol
[4:03:06] <Fiendmaw> It's very unlikely to not get you money's worth out of a sub unless you don't play at all
[4:03:07] <+ApocalypticExpress> that's something I thought I'd feel. but I've been addicted and you can always like cancel sub for a while and just come back later
[4:03:08] <adithehella> you can do free trial
[4:03:10] <%baka_sugoi> XBL LUL
[4:03:10] <Saltmeisterr> 20 a year
[4:03:11] <+sevorai> Its only like 12 a month for single character per server
[4:03:11] <+DreyfussFrost> @WoolieVersus If you think of MMOs in terms of price per game, it seems like a terrible deal, but think of them instead as price for replay value. MMOs have tremendous amounts of longevity. Are you not spending more buying a new $60 game every month when they get old?
[4:03:13] <+zepelinnn1> fuck a ps plus
[4:03:14] <PhilanthropyG> aye cmon woolie, go play Super Mario Party, now online 3 years later......
[4:03:15] <adithehella> get two expansions for freee
[4:03:15] <OkamiDude15> i thought it would be more for the year sub but its really cheap considering.
[4:03:18] <brachydios777> How much for a year?
[4:03:18] <Felto3> most people have the problem of playing too much and burning out
[4:03:19] <Cubblesv2> Well, FFXIV has a free trial all the way to 60...
[4:03:19] <jackythefrost> @WoolieVersus YoshiP has gone on record saying he wants his playerbase to take breaks from the game
[4:03:20] <+Arnschen> That's why the free trial goes to 60
[4:03:21] <Cubblesv2> >_>
[4:03:23] <+RyTYoung> Free til LV 60 though if you get in now
[4:03:24] <+Maswrath> YoshiP says don’t sub if you don’t play, he doesn’t want you wasting money and he doesn’t want you to feel bad
[4:03:27] <T_Sasquatch> I only buy a month and i play for that month
[4:03:29] <+terry_quest> the only issue is if you own a house in ff14
[4:03:29] <%DashXero> Guild Wars 1 was awesome!
[4:03:30] <TigerClaws12> buy to play
[4:03:33] <dds333a> sunken cost fallacy isn't it, because that's when you keep going despite not enjoying it because you're "already this far, might as well get it's worth out"
[4:03:36] <%DashXero> God, I miss GW1.
[4:03:38] <Klefth> Well, lucky for you, there is an extended free trial up to level 60 and including the award winning Heavensward expasion!
[4:03:39] <Hammatime8> Nines! :D
[4:03:40] <+seoliart> The industry has changed significantly since GW1
[4:03:40] <OmegaTrigun> you also have to buy living story though.
[4:03:43] <%Irridium> So a normal video game then
[4:03:45] <+mojopork4u> @WoolieVersus FFXIV has two free 100+ hour RPGs with no sub required
[4:03:46] <amused_platypus> is guild wars 1 still good
[4:03:47] <%Aeogard> @WoolieVersus If you're only playing FFXIV the whole month, it's often a much better value for a lot of people
[4:03:48] <TigerClaws12> skins
[4:03:49] <Srthunda> then theres the opposite, where you want to resubscribe and play, but fear life might get in the way
[4:03:50] <OmegaTrigun> old living story that is
[4:03:50] <DatAsuna> It leads to the community dwindling
[4:03:53] <+vaporousTippler> GW2's content cycle suffers from the lack of income.
[4:03:54] <SilveredPhoenix> IT'S TIME
[4:03:57] <+zepelinnn1> they have to get money to NOT invest into FFXIV!
[4:03:58] <+Tarviti> @Aeogard Yeah, we won't ever really know until we get a good look into the origins of Accord and whoever is monitoring the timelines
[4:03:59] <%Pyretech> Pyretech subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months!
[4:03:59] <%fetrigon> meh
[4:03:59] <DatAsuna> Destiny tried that it was a disaster
[4:03:59] <AzureSynesthesia> GW2 kinda still has FOMO cause you have to log in to get story conctent
[4:04:01] <+paladinstarbuster> You could not sub for a month if you wanted
[4:04:02] <rReizs> then you get Destiny transmog
[4:04:04] <@mothmandraws> all the ff14 money goes to ff7r woolie
[4:04:06] <%CodenameChaz> Sad thing is with GW's lack of a fee, they compensate with garbage loot boxes
[4:04:10] <+teh_rawk> what job would woolie be?
[4:04:11] <%KuroStardust> Buy 2 Play
[4:04:12] <+DreyfussFrost> Think of the sub in terms of the amount of gameplay you get from it per month. If you buy a new $60 game every 4 months it breaks even.
[4:04:14] <shieldecho> I mean FFXIV is also paying for FFXVI
[4:04:14] <Neoripo> Instanced MMO
[4:04:15] <+snausages_> Tbh, the FOMO with FFXIV is not doing content when its current, cause it will get outdated or the playerbase gets worse. The feeling of sub FOMO I've never felt cause when I ain't feeling FFXIV I just unsub as do most I think
[4:04:15] <+vaporousTippler> GW1 went by "CORPG" but GW2 is a full on MMO.
[4:04:15] <%Aeogard> @Tarviti Mood. When's our "dark side of earth" game?
[4:04:17] <seer0ftime> mnk
[4:04:21] <+zepelinnn1> how else are we going to give money to other FF projects if we dont make them pay the sub
[4:04:22] <Alice_Lufenia> FF7R and Avengers got all of 14's money ;_;
[4:04:24] <+TombstoneTTromboners> don't you know, Woolie? The FFXIV free trial is free up to level 60 and lets you play the entirety of Heavensward, no trial required.
[4:04:25] <+QueequegTheater> All the money in FFXIV goes to XVI and FF7R
[4:04:28] <+Arnschen> You can unsub to XIV and come back at a later time
[4:04:30] <Goraka91> @vaporousTippler Mm it's lost it's art style entirely focusing on gaudy store items
[4:04:30] <%Chichen> toobs
[4:04:30] <LycheeMusings> "I don't sexually identify as an MMO"
[4:04:35] <SilveredPhoenix> Seriously. Try it for free.
[4:04:35] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:04:38] <+seoliart> FF14 keeps Square afloat with their financial mismanagement LUL
[4:04:42] <+Maswrath> Problem is that ffxiv makes a ton of money, but square barely puts that money back into the game
[4:04:45] <OneThousandTomatoes> the survey for "why are you unsubing" doesnt pressure you either there are just things like "im not having fun anymore" or "I want to play other stuff" or "i want to take a break"
[4:04:50] <+Mountaindrewdle> the subscription service exists to pay for other square enix games, like avengers, the quiet man, life is stange 2, balan wonderworld
[4:04:53] <42nfl19> We TOTALLY did not kick 9S' ass
[4:04:57] <@Solidus_113> "it always ends like this"
[4:05:03] <+exbeau> how many hours of gameplay is worth $15 a month? cause i'm well over like 100 hours this month
[4:05:04] <+teh_rawk> i can only imagine if FF14 can actually use the money it pulls in
[4:05:07] <@mothmandraws> would be funny if nier replicant only existed due to ff14 money
[4:05:07] <%that__tj> @Mountaindrewdle Iam shaking my fist at you
[4:05:09] <Alice_Lufenia> we JUST got mo-cap animations in cut scenes like 8 months ago XD
[4:05:10] <+AustinEruption> yoooo the quiet man
[4:05:15] <dds333a> "I never know what I have until its gone"
[4:05:15] <+Tarviti> @Aeogard Really at this point I'm just waiting for them to explain the importance of twins to the multiverse
[4:05:18] <penitentpendant> "Hopefully they won't blow up this one."
[4:05:24] <%Skullgod> if you're in the tower party, the pf is up
[4:05:27] <+paladinstarbuster> "9 ess"
[4:05:28] <Irb11> I'm hoping we get VA in these raids in the future. the devs have basically said they have the money to do it now, it's more of a time thing
[4:05:33] <jorniev> OOOH MANEQUIN
[4:05:34] <+QueequegTheater> Yeah imagine if XIV got some of that money XIV earned
[4:05:35] <Darren716> LUL
[4:05:35] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[4:05:41] <%fetrigon> LUL

[4:06:16] <DSD24> Look at 9S's dumb shoes
[4:06:20] <UnsteadyFunk> How would you feel if you knew that money from FFXIV got put into shit like Balan Wonderworld
[4:06:22] <dds333a> !Stay tuned

[4:07:28] <+teh_rawk> theyre tokens
[4:07:29] <ReiRyghts1> you trade it in to upgrade gear
[4:07:29] <+Maswrath> The one you get from the third is the most interesting
[4:07:29] <%HeroToxiko> dkp
[4:07:29] <+Arnschen> Yeah, you use them to upgrade great
[4:07:31] <+QueequegTheater> @Equirah FFXIV made $40 million dollars that funded the Avengers game instead of being invested back into XIV
[4:07:34] <penitentpendant> Ah yes, 'reality ensues' the quest
[4:07:37] <+DreyfussFrost> It's a special token you can turn in for a gear upgrade.
[4:07:39] <+TombstoneTTromboners> now this is the yoko taro shit

[4:07:55] <majindusto> THE DWARVES
[4:07:58] <ArthurDoyleRPG> Come on guys SE is a small indie game company, they just don't have the budget to put into FFXIV doodLUL
[4:07:58] <Alice_Lufenia> it's finger pointing time
[4:07:59] <+Maswrath> Dooom!
[4:08:00] <LucentWulf> DOOOM
[4:08:01] <UnsteadyFunk> Not enough of them, clearly.
[4:08:01] <%Garthunox> @WoolieVersus the coins are exchanged for stuff to strengthen your gear
[4:08:02] <JanusII> Doomsaying Dwarf is mandatory.
[4:08:03] <%that__tj> Drakengard stuff now?
[4:08:05] <Equirah> @QueequegTheater what does that have to do with them unsibscribing? (btw they said the exact same thing)
[4:08:09] <%gatorafan> It's okay, they are dwarves Kappa
[4:08:21] <+Maswrath> Doomsaying dwarf is the best of the bunch
[4:08:24] <+QueequegTheater> @Equirah I am unsubscribing from their fact stream
[4:08:26] <+QueequegTheater> it's a joke
[4:08:29] <Neoripo> We are DOOOOOMED!
[4:08:37] <+QueequegTheater> @jackythefrost you got that I was joking, right?
[4:08:42] <OkamiDude15> woolie leaving because the dwarves are on screen Kappa
[4:08:48] <Fiendmaw> People fail to understand that the FF14 schedule doesn't work with immediate increases in budget. So budget fluctuations aren't apparent in the short term
[4:08:49] <passserby> Woolie escaping while he can
[4:09:02] <%Club_Sodar> woolies not coming back is he
[4:09:07] <+TombstoneTTromboners> woolie's gone
[4:09:09] <+QueequegTheater> @Fiendmaw it's been 5 years without a major budget increase
[4:09:11] <Hammatime8> Woolie making a run for it Kappa
[4:09:12] <jackythefrost> Oh I got it dont worry
[4:09:13] <%gatorafan> Guys I don't think Woolie is coming back daedra1DerpyTibs
[4:09:14] <oadf_threestrikes> going into duty finder to do the third raid so I can feel like I'm doing it alongside woolie
[4:09:15] <dds333a> Woolie took that walk after all
[4:09:16] <%ConflagrationsGaming> hes ESCAPPED
[4:09:16] <Alice_Lufenia> yeah, if they double XIV's schedule today, we won't see much change until like a YEAR from now
[4:09:18] <%Zepik> Welcome to new channel MinhVS
[4:09:21] <+QueequegTheater> @jackythefrost okay, thanks

[4:09:24] <tdude0175> is this the birth of minhvs?!?!
[4:09:25] <ArthurDoyleRPG> He went out for cigarettes doodSad
[4:09:26] <Alice_Lufenia> *double XIV's budget I mean
[4:09:28] <+xxx420stoat69xxx> woolie ran aeay PogChamp
[4:09:35] <%cisealnine> Woolie then hurled himself out the window so that he may escape MMO's.

[4:10:05] <+QueequegTheater> @Fiendmaw higher budget means more staff

[4:10:13] <ArthurDoyleRPG> Oh no don't say anything bad Minh
[4:10:15] <DatAsuna> don't jack off on woolie's couch
[4:10:16] <MKII> to answer woolie's question the $12.99 sub is worth as much as you want it to be. some people play 15 hours a month and some people get 120 hours of playtime for their sub

[4:10:35] <Fiendmaw> @QueequegTheater Using staff increase as a metric means nothing when they use outside contractors for models etc. very frequently
[4:10:37] <%DrJamesWoods> LOL
[4:10:37] <+ConLin_Arts_> stoked for Endwalker?
[4:10:41] <+TombstoneTTromboners> jack off on woolie's couch, minh

[4:11:13] <+mojopork4u> The jack off bit someone posted is the DSP bit reference chat
[4:11:14] <mybigmeech> This stream is in shambles LUL
[4:11:14] <+DreyfussFrost> Don't cycle your hotbars Kappa
[4:11:16] <@mothmandraws> delay life phase
[4:11:16] <+seoliart> Don't queue your animation locks together
[4:11:16] <%cisealnine> Are you having a nice day, Minh?
[4:11:17] <jaysondeez> you must tank the floor yourself to master dragoon
[4:11:18] <+Nobrev> learn where your animation locks are
[4:11:18] <Agami23> the rotation is the simpliest thing in the world for dragoon. its great
[4:11:18] <%jinking79> still playing Naruto's Striker Minh
[4:11:19] <+getHazed> that goes for all classes lol
[4:11:20] <Neoripo> Never backjump
[4:11:21] <mr_saturday93> No minh read all our gross shit
[4:11:21] <+QueequegTheater> You're not even using Wheeling Thrust, 0/10 stream Kappa
[4:11:22] <2DSuperiority> convince everyone to be lala
[4:11:22] <+ApocalypticExpress> dragoon is all about tanking the floor
[4:11:27] <MegboyManuel> prepare for animation lock
[4:11:29] <PhazonSuited> delay life so you can get it in second lance charge
[4:11:30] <%gatorafan> Are rotations another form of THE SPIN? daedra1DrunkTibs
[4:11:35] <%Club_Sodar> @WoolieVersus favorite expansion?
[4:11:35] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1386952720297381894?s=19
[4:11:37] <%Farples> Farples subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! Heya Woolz and Minh. Keep on keeping on. Good luck with Ultimate Minh.
[4:11:37] <%DrJamesWoods> Most important
[4:11:38] <DatAsuna> These codex episodes on youtube are gonna be 13 sentinels all over again. "ANALYSIS 53%"
[4:11:38] <Agami23> dont floor tank
[4:11:39] <+xxx420stoat69xxx> thoughts on warrior and why it's the best tank?
[4:11:39] <+terry_quest> dont die
[4:11:41] <+mojopork4u> @WoolieVersus Is Lancer still viable?
[4:11:42] <+TombstoneTTromboners> my number one tip: don't fuck up
[4:11:42] <RamenRiderZ> Always Be Casting
[4:11:46] <%DrJamesWoods> You do the least dps when you're dead
[4:11:48] <Divryne> The most important tip is to read The Balance.
[4:11:50] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Real advice for DRG is make sure you're using your oGCDs as much as possible
[4:11:50] <Neoripo> No Mihgn, they are quite real tips
[4:11:56] <tdude0175> Oh no woolies back!
[4:11:57] <aqua_mashu> use doomspike its great
[4:11:59] <+snausages_> I hope they make healing better in Endwalker
[4:11:59] <+Maswrath> New DPS definitely doesn’t use a scythe
[4:12:03] <rReizs> you can lb without breaking your combo if you are on fang and claw or wheeling thrust
[4:12:03] <oadf_threestrikes> ahhhh. I've mostly played monk and GNB at 80 so I was curious if there were any notable things. gotta mind the jumps tho, gotcha
[4:12:04] <+ApocalypticExpress> @xxx420stoat69xxx that's a weird way to spell dark knight
[4:12:07] <feralspidey> I've played too much KH, I thought those were Heartless for a second...
[4:12:11] <DatAsuna> yeah knowing the rotation is just the starting point
[4:12:12] <Agami23> master lancer at least
[4:12:12] <+notgarza> What’s your healing class?
[4:12:13] <+snausages_> Congrats on number 1 ffxiv strimer
[4:12:13] <+Maswrath> We already have a class that uses scythes
[4:12:20] <+QueequegTheater> DRG damage lives in the oGCD
[4:12:20] <Klefth> Blue parsing DRG :v
[4:12:27] <%Zepik> Best tip for drg: do the opposite of everything mothman says or does
[4:12:27] <+seoliart> Well not like everyone can clear E12S
[4:12:29] <+FrostedZaibatsu> @feralspidey cmonBruh
[4:12:47] <+xxx420stoat69xxx> minh is grey confirmed
[4:12:48] <Klefth> So an alright DRG and not a crazy person
[4:12:48] <penitentpendant> A clear's a clear
[4:12:49] <Agami23> learn who to put eyes on for dragoon. samurai or summoner are your best bets
[4:12:49] <+QueequegTheater> DRG tips: when you jump, just don't come back down
[4:12:49] <+Arnschen> Oh nice, got purple parses
[4:12:49] <rReizs> delaying your first life of the dragon lets your first two stardivers fall under buffs
[4:12:51] <%DrJamesWoods> Whats the good colors for parse?
[4:12:59] <%thedankestmeeme> minh I felt like I havent seen you in a while how's life?
[4:13:05] <speximillian> How long have you played?
[4:13:05] <+snausages_> purple honestly pretty good i'd have thought
[4:13:11] <+snausages_> but I'm super late to the tier
[4:13:13] <+QueequegTheater> @Agami23 BLM if they've got leylines down as well
[4:13:16] <UnsteadyFunk> Make sure you use Life Surge right before Battle Litany so it crits :)
[4:13:23] <oadf_threestrikes> oh queue popped, enjoy the wacky yoko taro content!
[4:13:23] <ArthurDoyleRPG> I wish DRG had Auto-Life doodLUL
[4:13:35] <+Maswrath> I’m hoping for something like gabranth in Dissidia
[4:13:38] <+DreyfussFrost> @seoliart Unless they're severely disabled, anybody sufficiently motivated could clear savage. Just depends if you want it enough to improve your play enough.
[4:13:40] <Agami23> @QueequegTheater yeah but you can never trust BLM
[4:13:56] <+QueequegTheater> @Agami23 Context is important, kids LUL
[4:13:57] <Agami23> they'll think the eye is a tether and run away
[4:13:58] <dds333a> Arms crossed
[4:14:07] <+Maswrath> Doomed!
[4:14:16] <42nfl19> Wait so are those dwarves alchemists or mages?
[4:14:17] <+R0DA> @DrJamesWoods Grey parse is trash, green parse is below average, blue is above average, purple is good, orange/yellow/pink are top tiers
[4:14:21] <%DashXero> Uh...
[4:14:22] <Neoripo> Dooooomed!!!!
[4:14:25] <Agami23> wait. god damnit i just realized what else that is a acronym for. black mage people, black mage!

[4:14:44] <+seoliart> @DreyfussFrost That requires people to learn their job. There are occasions where I evidentially see people getting carried through savage checking their damage logs.

[4:15:11] <Klefth> Nah, you were too busy downplaying everything that was going on LUL
[4:15:13] <FunnyCrimes> it was playing in the village
[4:15:14] <%KuroStardust> Too busy hating dwarves
[4:15:22] <Ks201> It had a slightly different version
[4:15:27] <Arazien> Classic Woolie. Hating lore important dwarves too much to notice the good bits
[4:15:28] <PinkSocks> these dwarves are the most Taro shit ever
[4:15:31] <JanusII> The dwarf parts are actually great.
[4:15:32] <%dios_happy_hour> i do not blame checking out in the village
[4:15:33] <majindusto> IT TOTALLY WAS PLAYING

[4:16:48] <%thetunnelhomer> At the very least they have cool designs .
[4:16:48] <OneThousandTomatoes> why does woolie hate the dwarves?
[4:16:50] <Sydin18> Top ff14 streamer and top rudest chat >:o
[4:16:50] <+TombstoneTTromboners> woolie: "what if I skip all the yoko taro so I can get to none of it..."

[4:16:56] <%nabby1> Dont insult the #1 ff streamer
[4:16:58] <@Solidus_113> The dwarves are all about Moral absolutism, I believe is the term
[4:16:58] <Robot_Nixon_> @Arazien no one cares
[4:16:58] <+snausages_> Dorf will be main character in the next game which finally merges the Nier and Drakengard storylines

[4:24:21] <PhazonSuited> teledji
[4:24:21] <+DreyfussFrost> Legit, if you play the base game you learn that the potatos are bastards.
[4:24:21] <+MTLxSpider> Lalafell with facial hair*
[4:24:22] <primaryfire> shove em in an oven
[4:24:23] <AzureSynesthesia> lol kinda but zenos isnt a lalafell
[4:24:23] <Goraka91> Yes
[4:24:23] <Sydin18> Lalafells are either Pure of heart or pure evil
[4:24:24] <jaysondeez> Tataru and Krile and Pipin
[4:24:24] <ArthurDoyleRPG> Hear with eyes unclouded by hate doodSmug
[4:24:24] <RAH001> Turn mount music off
[4:24:25] <+QueequegTheater> @CodenameChaz AND HE WAS THE WORST
[4:24:26] <+RowenCleric> even Zenos is a lalafel piloting a pretty anime man
[4:24:27] <+MugenSandan> Ah yes ZENOS THE LALAFELL
[4:24:28] <%DashXero> Honestly, I just hate the lalafel because they're small and self-important.
[4:24:28] <+paladinstarbuster> Rascim condoned by woolie
[4:24:31] <%QuadraticGravity> Teledji Motherfucking Adeledji
[4:24:31] <+xxx420stoat69xxx> zenos has the soul of a lala
[4:24:36] <Goraka91> Teledji and Adeledji are the worst
[4:24:36] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> they have the curse of hatred @woolieversus
[4:24:37] <neostria> lalafell are the 1%
[4:24:38] <+TheotherKristian> Racist? Yes!
[4:24:38] <+R0DA> Elezen are just tallafells
[4:24:38] <SomersaultJustice> who's that one lalafel that betrays you with the really deep voice
[4:24:40] <PhilanthropyG> but also, the best scion on the team is Tataru, a lala potato
[4:24:40] <+NYCrownlessKing> what no
[4:24:41] <rReizs> vauthry was just an oversized lalafell
[4:24:42] <Who_lio42> lalafells are usually some sort of asshat
[4:24:42] <+Ilpala> The lala in power are the worst things imaginable: capitalists
[4:24:44] <valriot> ACTUAL RACIST ELEZEN
[4:24:45] <%KuroStardust> OH YEAH Woolie would love the plot of Heavensward
[4:24:46] <stormhawk9891> Yeah pretty much
[4:24:46] <+QueequegTheater> @AzureSynesthesia Zenos isn't a villain he just wants your fight dick
[4:24:46] <seer0ftime> the capitalists can't fit in a normal guillotine
[4:24:47] <Neoripo> Uldah is 100% Lalafell Mafia
[4:24:48] <%deadbeat34> didn't one of the really shithead lalafells get cut in half?
[4:24:50] <+NYCrownlessKing> it is just ishgqrdians not the elves lol
[4:24:50] <amused_platypus> elves are morally grey
[4:24:51] <olaksi> at least ishgard doesn't have lalafels
[4:24:51] <+IxDomxI> @SomersaultJustice yuyuhase
[4:24:52] <+QueequegTheater> YES THEY ARE
[4:24:54] <+caramelatte1> Tataru is the most Dangerious
[4:24:54] <+JustBlubs> We all know the elfs stink, Lalafell try to look cute while doing it is the difference
[4:24:54] <RWLJr98> SKYRIM IS FOR DE NORDES
[4:24:55] <@Solidus_113> all of Ul Dah is fucked up because of Lalas
[4:24:55] <%that__tj> THEY MIGHT BE
[4:24:56] <ClarentMordred> some of the most annoying characters in some of the arcs are lalafel
[4:24:57] <+dreaith1> Zenos isn't a villain, he's just MISUNDERSTOOD
[4:24:57] <+mojopork4u> @WoolieVersus There is literally a capitalist uprising against the lalafell race who controls the economy and is basically the illuminati. And that's just a minor plot point!
[4:24:58] <RamenRiderZ> Zenos is three lalafell in a costume
[4:24:58] <penitentpendant> Zenos is not a lalafell
[4:24:59] <Riorii> they kinda are
[4:24:59] <+zepelinnn1> NOT ALL LALAFELLS
[4:24:59] <%Irridium> I think they are, actually

[4:25:00] <+Suchawus> Dont Blame them, yet
[4:25:00] <VidulaSaix> There absolutely is
[4:25:02] <jaysondeez> there is an evil group but not lalafells
[4:25:02] <Alice_Lufenia> really only the villains from Ul'dah
[4:25:02] <Goraka91> Oh no, we have a proper Akatsuki
[4:25:03] <+ALazo> I'm sure a lalafell was secretly to blame offscreen for the dragon war
[4:25:04] <dds333a> Legitimate racist Elezen
[4:25:04] <@mothmandraws> monetarists

[4:25:08] <%KuroStardust> There is a literal Syndicate
[4:25:09] <+MTLxSpider> yuyuhase Kappa

[4:25:09] <+Nobrev> the evil group of lalafells is all of ul'dah
[4:25:09] <Alice_Lufenia> and that's cause Ul'Dah are mostly lolafell
[4:25:10] <rReizs> thordan is a lalafell that was shaped like a french fry

[4:30:49] <DedlokPM> @42nfl19 Wasn't yoko that i know of. It was the nier game account. https://twitter.com/NieRGame/status/1385641802955378689
[4:30:50] <JanusII> They're younger than the Chief.
[4:30:50] <+JustBlubs> Yeah they're children, it's hard to tell since they're dwarves with fake beards
[4:30:52] <AzureSynesthesia> ironic cause a central core of nier is experiencing emphathy for other beings you wouldnt expect lol
[4:30:54] <+zepelinnn1> cmonBruh
[4:30:54] <dbag202> racist
[4:30:54] <Neoripo> Kids and orphans

[4:30:55] <PhazonSuited> the beard is a prt of the helmet
[4:30:55] <MegboyManuel> a 20 year old can be a "kid" to some old, tbf
[4:30:56] <Iwashi94> wow Mihn D:
[4:30:57] <primaryfire> just because an old fart calls them kids it doesn't mean they are
[4:30:58] <%that__tj> wow thats racist
[4:30:58] <Agami23> the chief calls them kids, but that could be him thinking of them as HIS kids
[4:31:00] <boltstrykex> no parents siblings
[4:31:00] <Ultimatefool> Wow Minh
[4:31:00] <DatAsuna> wow minh
[4:31:01] <Zayasu> cmonBruh

[4:31:10] <MegboyManuel> the chief could be balls old
[4:31:13] <+xxx420stoat69xxx> omg minh you can't say they all look the same!
[4:31:17] <DatAsuna> Minh with the mask off
[4:31:18] <OneThousandTomatoes> I dodnt think theres a child lalafell model
[4:31:18] <kitcorin> this goddamn mount music NotLikeThis
[4:31:22] <DatAsuna> "you know how they are"
[4:31:25] <Ks201> At the very least they are like 18
[4:31:26] <+ActiveLink> yes, it was explicitly stated that they are children
[4:31:28] <+QueequegTheater> It's not racist if it's against Lalafells
[4:31:30] <+zepelinnn1> the fat chocobo song only adds to the experience
[4:31:42] <DetroitSentai> just got here, did woolie get explained that the dorfs just wear helmets with fake beards
[4:31:44] <tdude0175> Good ol flight suit
[4:31:51] <RWLJr98> Bruh, mounting to walk 20 feet LUL

[4:32:36] <Equirah> ...... "Kirin"
[4:32:37] <+ALazo> I'm actually surprised ff14 showed up in this channel. Are we only covering the nier raid out of interest in yoko taro stuff?
[4:32:37] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[4:32:59] <%deadbeat34> time for some shadowbringers lore
[4:32:59] <Dragon_Batman> I don't remember what you guys named that one
[4:33:03] <Equirah> it's not just in FF X LUL
[4:33:05] <Neoripo> it's fine, too many references
[4:33:05] <Agami23> that might have been the ramuh lightning horse
[4:33:07] <+QueequegTheater> @Aeogard my twitter has been banned for like a year, I just never logged out of it on my laptop
[4:33:07] <+Huderga> woolie hate ff confirmed

[4:33:11] <+DreyfussFrost> @ALazo Yeah, exactly. Woolie is 110% checked out on everything else.
[4:33:11] <dds333a> Aren't Qirin more like giraffes, or deer?
[4:33:15] <Robot_Nixon_> @QueequegTheater thats a pre-emptive parry atpQuan
[4:33:16] <%Dapper_Cactuar> Yojimbo is a boss in the game too
[4:33:19] <OneThousandTomatoes> I didn't know it was a reference
[4:33:20] <DetroitSentai> @ALazo pretty much, minh got a buncha people together to run the raids so woolie could learn
[4:33:23] <dds333a> In actual myth, I mean
[4:33:25] <+TombstoneTTromboners> THE CAR HELL YEAH

[4:34:10] <+Tarviti> The cat from Yokai Watch would disagree
[4:34:11] <%DrJamesWoods> Technology is surprisingly advanced in this game
[4:34:16] <majindusto> ADVENT CHILDREN BIKE
[4:34:20] <WanderingSwordsman> you can get a ratholos as a mount
[4:34:21] <bestwaifuritsu> SCREE

[4:35:08] <2DSuperiority> when a lala drives the Regalia their legs don't even reach the pedals
[4:35:09] <PhazonSuited> maybe a cinder drift run
[4:35:09] <afronooch> g warrior
[4:35:09] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus sent the bunker logs, you're not forced to go through like the factory, but you still should for one thing
[4:35:09] <%DrJamesWoods> G-Savior!

[4:35:17] <+NYCrownlessKing> any chance i can jump in for the 3rd raid?? @WoolieVersus
[4:35:18] <+QueequegTheater> THAT'S CANON
[4:35:19] <SomersaultJustice> in the epoch
[4:35:19] <DetroitSentai> Construct 8, G Warrior, Alexander and Cruise Chaser
[4:35:20] <akareynolds88> G Warrior
[4:35:25] <Agami23> theres alot of mecha around. like the mountain thing
[4:35:33] <+TombstoneTTromboners> the regalia is fucking wild
[4:35:34] <+Masked_Hero_Lucky> It's worth noting that the Regalia you get is a replica of the original. Cid reverse engineered a crazy future car.
[4:35:35] <%DrJamesWoods> I understand. Car looks too much like our world
[4:35:35] <+ApocalypticExpress> Cruise Chaserrr
[4:35:36] <dds333a> @theheroappears pretty much, although it's decidedly modern. however, ever since FFVI already introduced Magitek and whatnot
[4:35:39] <+mojopork4u> GUNDAM
[4:35:41] <TigerClaws12> cause it's modeled after a bentley or something LUL
[4:35:45] <%jonblnt> regalia is too modern
[4:35:47] <+RowenCleric> the way it slides around and spins really makes the regalia
[4:35:52] <@Solidus_113> save that for another stream
[4:35:54] <+SouLucha> how do you turn this on Kappa
[4:35:56] <Zebroneath> using the right words
[4:35:57] <Neoripo> The G Warrior
[4:35:57] <olaksi> There's no modern cars despite all the magic-technology, no, i see why it's jarring
[4:35:58] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus There is a canon fight in which you fight the Sapphire Weapon in a gundam
[4:35:58] <%nabby1> Escalade mount
[4:35:58] <Robot_Nixon_> @NYCrownlessKing dm mothman he seemed to be organizing the raids
[4:36:04] <Equirah> I may be interested in thi - Woolie LUL
[4:36:05] <+mitzieter> when did woolie start playing ff14?
[4:36:07] <Goraka91> Ladies and gentlemen, we got him
[4:36:07] <+NYCrownlessKing> whats his name on twitch? @Tuna_Can_0
[4:36:08] <mr_red117> Skullgod
[4:36:11] <%DrJamesWoods> I want that Regalia though
[4:36:13] <duchessdynamic> Woolie's not playing it
[4:36:13] <Agami23> it absolutely looks like an orbital frame
[4:36:13] <mr_red117> is in charge
[4:36:14] <tdude0175> We have to expose as much ff14 to woolie as we can
[4:36:14] <+NYCrownlessKing> YOO MOTH MAN~
[4:36:15] <+paladinstarbuster> just saying jehuty will get woolie anywhere LUL
[4:36:16] <+mitzieter> o
[4:36:22] <2DSuperiority> *explains all of Shadowbringers*
[4:36:22] <%Skullgod> @mr_red117 ?
[4:36:22] <+IxDomxI> 3rd raid is full already
[4:36:24] <+caramelatte1> you can skip cutscenes btw
[4:36:24] <+ApocalypticExpress> i need the cruise chaser mount to be real and mine
[4:36:25] <%Kiso52> did he see rathalos....shamelessly showing it right now XD
[4:36:26] <%deadbeat34> Holy shit, Minh is right, FFXIV has a boss fight that's just ZOE
[4:36:29] <OneThousandTomatoes> msq stuff
[4:36:38] <Solidnick18> BibleThump
[4:36:39] <+QueequegTheater> @Skullgod do not speak his name
[4:36:42] <dds333a> Inhert has always been my favorite
[4:36:43] <+terry_quest> @NYCrownlessKing all slots are full
[4:36:43] <@Solidus_113> yeah
[4:36:44] <+paladinstarbuster> jehuty cockpit wiff
[4:36:47] <DedlokPM> SourPls
[4:36:50] <+snausages_> Isn't it fake french?
[4:36:50] <Goraka91> Foolishness
[4:36:53] <OneThousandTomatoes> that's how chaos language is
[4:36:54] <@Solidus_113> Chaos Language is a mix of like 4 different languages
[4:36:54] <+TombstoneTTromboners> no it's chaos language
[4:36:56] <duchessdynamic> The gibberish is a construct of multiple languages basically
[4:36:57] <RinWR> No, it sounds French but there's no actual French.
[4:36:57] <OkamiDude15> its a mix of languages
[4:36:58] <Dragon_Batman> Yea that specific one is based off of french
[4:36:59] <$Giothegame> It's a mixture of languages
[4:36:59] <Agami23> the song is a fake language that is a mix of like 5
[4:36:59] <+Arnschen> It's a made up language taking from french and other stuff
[4:36:59] <mr_red117> @mr_red117 was attempting to correct someone, hit enter too early
[4:37:01] <+snausages_> I think Woolie is right on this one
[4:37:02] <2DSuperiority> it's a mix french english japanese
[4:37:02] <Toni_Master43> It's not French, it's based on it
[4:37:03] <dbag202> French is a made up language
[4:37:05] <+mojopork4u> They use French Latin and more words when singing "chaos language" @WoolieVersus
[4:37:06] <%zacyzacy> all language its made up
[4:37:06] <%bread_assassin> French is borderline gibberish, though.
[4:37:06] <+Helljump3r6> what about brute justice from alexander? woolie would love it
[4:37:06] <%DrJamesWoods> The song is sung in the human language in general
[4:37:08] <+TheotherKristian> Though it is chaos languges, it can also draw inspiration from real languages
[4:37:08] <DedlokPM> It's like a mixture of languages IIRC
[4:37:08] <+kettleroot> french isnt real
[4:37:08] <+TombstoneTTromboners> it sounds like other languages but it's not
[4:37:08] <hakumaribo> @WoolieVersus theres a straight up gundam fight that can be replayed thru newgame+
[4:37:10] <tollyx> nah it's all gibberish
[4:37:11] <Zeif00> Based on multiple languages
[4:37:12] <ClarentMordred> chaos is a mix of phonetics from different languages
[4:37:12] <+QueequegTheater> It's English, French, Japanese, and gibberish, right?
[4:37:15] <Goraka91> It's giberish
[4:37:16] <dds333a> I think it's all made up
[4:37:18] <%Aeogard> Original Gestalt/Replicant had versions of songs with regular languages @WoolieVersus
[4:37:18] <+Leftovermemes> they are fake but based on french mostly
[4:37:23] <%Javaa01> French is gibberish
[4:37:25] <+FrostedZaibatsu> Isnt french gibberish
[4:37:26] <seer0ftime> never mind brute justice someone show him rise
[4:37:27] <Robot_Nixon_> yes french the made up language atpRtsd
[4:37:27] <datlambo458> It’s a mixture of Japanese, French, and gibberish
[4:37:28] <adithehella> phonetically french
[4:37:28] <Neoripo> It's giverish based in a mismash of french, jp, spanish, english
[4:37:29] <Louie_Salmon> It has french sounds, yeah
[4:37:30] <OkamiDude15> @WoolieVersus chaos language is 4 languages mixed together
[4:37:30] <+TombstoneTTromboners> there's also a real dead language in some of the songs
[4:37:30] <AzureSynesthesia> weight of the world has literal english, japanese, and french
[4:37:31] <RinWR> Am French, it fucking ain't
[4:37:32] <+teh_rawk> french is the most chaotic language
[4:37:34] <tattleworm> it's based on lots of things, in replicant/gestalt they have different language inspirations for each area
[4:37:34] <+Leftovermemes> its a fake language based on french and german
[4:37:36] <twoto858> catJAM
[4:37:36] <OneThousandTomatoes> what languages sound like in 1000 years
[4:37:36] <Dragon_Batman> Some songs have more of a mix than others
[4:37:37] <+snausages_> They base it off real languages phonetics but it's not actually the language. THere are french language tracks during the credits sequences of both games though
[4:37:37] <dds333a> EMI Evans was the vocalist in Nier, right?
[4:37:38] <+SouLucha> I think it's a mix of several different languages, wasn't it?
[4:37:39] <StencilOST> its french-Japanese right?
[4:37:39] <+ApocalypticExpress> based off french, celtic, and a bucha stuff
[4:37:40] <+mojopork4u> @WoolieVersus Emi Evans makes up the lyrics based off of how it would sound. She totally 100% uses french words to elicit chaos language
[4:37:41] <+captainplanet88> german, french, japanese
[4:37:41] <+snausages_> iirc
[4:37:43] <clloudberry> wasn't the french gibberish called nouveau or something like that?
[4:37:48] <alrobot2014> there are versions of the chaos language tracks in french english and japanese iirc
[4:37:58] <Dragon_Batman> Gaelic is used as well in Replicant
[4:37:59] <+snausages_> I hear a lot of Irish in some of nIer's soundtrack
[4:38:00] <tattleworm> like the junk heap uses english as its basis
[4:38:01] <+Arnschen> Ohhh
[4:38:05] <Ks201> It’s a fake language that used a mix of languages so sometimes you can hear clear words
[4:38:09] <Equirah> there's no kixed tracks
[4:38:11] <+mojopork4u> Weight of the World has 4 renditions
[4:38:12] <Goraka91> Ashes of Dreams and Weight of the World are special cases
[4:38:14] <Equirah> *mixed
[4:38:14] <%HeroToxiko> Beyond the bounds
[4:38:15] <PhazonSuited> there's a gibberish version of it, if i recall
[4:38:15] <@mothmandraws> the ff14 version of weight of world is in chaos
[4:38:20] <+snausages_> Yeah, weight of the world and Ashes of Dreams are real language
[4:38:23] <+mikesapartment> Minh not looking at the mini map arrow is hurting my soul
[4:38:24] <+snausages_> the credits musics
[4:38:25] <%DrJamesWoods> Where minh going?
[4:38:26] <+Arnschen> There was an English version, Chaos version, and Japanese
[4:38:27] <DetroitSentai> Weight of the world has multiple tracks, most nier songs are not real languages tho
[4:38:28] <Neoripo> Weight of the world is sung in English, Jp and Nier language
[4:38:28] <+Leftovermemes> weight of the world is the only non gibberish
[4:38:29] <dds333a> You can phonetically sound it out, but it won't mean anything, but I get the point
[4:38:31] <+Huderga> minh where are you going?
[4:38:37] <+TombstoneTTromboners> Ashes of Dreams french version is actually gibberish
[4:38:38] <@Solidus_113> Minh pay attention to the quest
[4:38:40] <RinWR> No Pat, you're wrong.
[4:38:41] <jaysondeez> you can teleport to stilltide
[4:38:41] <ClarentMordred> Ashes of dream has an english version but the "other language" versions are just chaos languages based on the phonetics of that language
[4:38:41] <+MostRefinedCalla> Ashes of a Dream is multi langue
[4:38:43] <Apolonm> Isn't French basically chaos
[4:38:48] <DetroitSentai> Stilltide
[4:38:50] <+ApocalypticExpress> Minh
[4:38:51] <ClarentMordred> not the actual languages
[4:38:55] <RinWR> @WoolieVersus Can confirm it's bullshit, am French.
[4:38:58] <+snausages_> Woolie is right, the opposite of crazy talk
[4:39:01] <+MTLxSpider> yes
[4:39:05] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus sent the bunker logs, you're not forced to go through like the factory, but you still should for one thing
[4:39:05] <+Kyma1020> The Nier language is a cobbled up version of multiple languages. They just took what they found after the apocalypse and mixed it together
[4:39:06] <+OblivionSword1> agree
[4:39:07] <2DSuperiority> it's a mix of languages
[4:39:13] <+snausages_> @Kyma1020 ^^^
[4:39:15] <Robot_Nixon_> minh is deterring stream snipers Kappa
[4:39:15] <+ApocalypticExpress> the Nier Language is a mix of a buncha languages
[4:39:16] <AdmiralButtloaf> Bonjour!. Damn jibberish
[4:39:16] <datlambo458> French is a base
[4:39:18] <wibbwobbler> it works
[4:39:21] <whatatkins> there's some irish in there too
[4:39:22] <+NYCrownlessKing> if you look around you might see me, as Crownless King @WoolieVersus
[4:39:23] <datlambo458> Same with Japanese and others

[4:39:54] <OkamiDude15> @WoolieVersus french is 1 of the many used in chaos language. its an amalgamation
[4:39:56] <+QueequegTheater> Canadian French is about as much French as Creole is English
[4:40:09] <Gutsandlove> much i mean
[4:40:11] <primaryfire> devola tells you the song of ancients is in an ancient forgotten language yea

[4:40:13] <+xxx420stoat69xxx> k
[4:40:16] <+mojopork4u> @WoolieVersus It's like going to Facade and thinking it's all made up but whenever they talk about dads/fathers they use "tosan" based off of Japanese "otousan". It's not gibberish moreas based off actual language
[4:40:25] <+Leftovermemes> angelic
[4:40:34] <+snausages_> Yeah those are the only ones
[4:40:36] <majindusto> Why does WOOLIE pronounce Gestalt with an H?
[4:40:42] <DetroitSentai> There are a couple songs that have real languages, but they are outliers
[4:40:42] <+snausages_> Weight of the World in Automata, Ashes of Dreams in Nier
[4:40:47] <Equirah> @mojopork4u that's the remake tho
[4:41:00] <Dragon_Batman> You mean like Geshtalt? yea that is how it is

[4:41:12] <%QuadraticGravity> interesting
[4:41:12] <%DrJamesWoods> Isn't that correct?
[4:41:12] <Neoripo> Woolie is correct
[4:41:12] <+xxx420stoat69xxx> yeah you right

[4:46:48] <%Club_Sodar> tbf Jessies just doing weekly resets
[4:46:48] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:46:58] <%Club_Sodar> but still dope
[4:47:01] <+Cionyl> XIV players love to watch people do things for the first time.
[4:47:02] <Dragon_Batman> Ahh that's fair
[4:47:15] <OneThousandTomatoes> @cionyl true that
[4:47:16] <Equirah> @QueequegTheater 800+700 isn't above 1300
[4:47:21] <JanusII> Especially the Ninjas.
[4:47:22] <Neoripo> Sad SAM noises
[4:47:22] <penitentpendant> "Just dodge cancel through the attacks."
[4:47:23] <FunnyCrimes> woolie confirmed never used light swords
[4:47:24] <gunstars20> Not throwing swords DansGame
[4:47:25] <blackkanye> An uncivilized swordsman style
[4:47:27] <+QueequegTheater> @Equirah it is in Eorzean math
[4:47:29] <Equirah> @QueequegTheater *bellow
[4:47:30] <AdmiralButtloaf> Wouldn't 2B just be happy to be around living people
[4:47:30] <RinWR> 2B would more likely going HUMANS??
[4:47:30] <Dragon_Batman> I mean there is a huge interest in seeing someones first time through something
[4:47:33] <+teh_rawk> limited by lack of anti gravity gear
[4:47:41] <Agami23> no, she is probably looking at sword users going "did you just shoot a sword out of your sword redmage?"
[4:47:41] <%DrJamesWoods> One is behind you first teleport into the laser hallway. There are a bunch in the command post so don't jump down right away. Go down the stairs and stuff.
[4:47:47] <+MugenSandan> not really considering the ass that Warriors of Light can kick
[4:47:47] <ArthurDoyleRPG> But you hold your sword 2B...
[4:47:47] <Zeif00> watch out for open shit
[4:47:48] <musharnum> hi king are you winninh

[4:49:06] <+NYCrownlessKing> thats her bed size in the actual game tho woolie lol @WoolieVersus
[4:49:06] <zecht89> Has Woolie not seen 2B's Phat ass?
[4:49:07] <Equirah> Kingsize bed and chair Kappa
[4:49:08] <%CodenameChaz> Need a large bed to fit all those illogical emotions

[4:49:11] <PhilanthropyG> perhaps androids are huge?
[4:49:11] <feralspidey> Woolie,we get it. You want giant robot girl.
[4:49:12] <+Arxel1> wait what

[4:49:17] <Keihart> Snif the boots Kreygasm
[4:49:18] <IamGrapes> king sized bed, yo. its the best
[4:49:24] <rReizs> androids man they probably got the idea of the bed and thought yeah that seems about right
[4:49:26] <penitentpendant> (This was the boss's name that you saw in Hexidecimal)
[4:49:30] <+QueequegTheater> @NYCrownlessKing they have to jerk off somewhere
[4:49:31] <+xxx420stoat69xxx> sniff the boots woolie

[4:49:57] <%justcallmebobplease> He is SUPER dialed in on that, it's true...
[4:49:58] <42nfl19> bed huge enough...for TWO people maybe? Kidding...unless?
[4:50:01] <dbag202> It's because Yoko secretly wonders what humans are like
[4:50:03] <Dragon_Batman> Like the bots trying to work out a puzzle that just doesn't work
[4:50:07] <+QueequegTheater> NO
[4:50:09] <OneThousandTomatoes> sadge
[4:50:11] <+NYCrownlessKing> YES
[4:50:12] <penitentpendant> @OneThousandTomatoes "Longing" that entry was specifically written by her
[4:50:13] <%DrJamesWoods> I tried to warn
[4:50:13] <Eustacecervidae> Yoko Taro is the AI writer that every Hollywood studio would like to have in their pockets
[4:50:17] <Srthunda> how unfortunate
[4:50:18] <+QueequegTheater> Minh you have to go back now
[4:50:19] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[4:50:19] <Robot_Nixon_> I thought his talent was horniness

[4:50:22] <+QueequegTheater> You missed one
[4:50:22] <penitentpendant> "David Cage" but good
[4:50:23] <+mojopork4u> societal commentary is where more nuanced and noteworthy imo. videogames, even deep ones are very immature when it comes to handling sensitive topics
[4:50:23] <+wunp_fxs> LUL
[4:50:23] <%Irridium> LUL
[4:50:23] <dds333a> We have a plethora of weapons, but we throw them all

[4:50:24] <+mikesapartment> take a lap son
[4:50:25] <+ChrisAlgoo> i made ze bad game
[4:50:25] <+kraajkase> It's because he himself is trying to figure that shit out

[4:50:26] <OneThousandTomatoes> no
[4:50:26] <%Chichen> nope

[4:50:37] <+Huderga> wait

[4:50:37] <jaysondeez> you will pass by again
[4:50:37] <%Major_Lee_> Technically because minh’s playing a potato, has 2B even seen a human in this world?
[4:50:38] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Use return
[4:50:40] <%cisealnine> Too short to ride the elevator.

[4:50:45] <%DrJamesWoods> I wrote it all
[4:50:47] <NeonBleu> Lost because small
[4:50:47] <iosephe> time extended
[4:50:48] <%HitchhikingThrough> "Can a robot be human?" "Can a human be human?"
[4:50:49] <rReizs> davnaruto hocage
[4:50:50] <AllenDeadman> small ding
[4:50:51] <%DrJamesWoods> Turn around
[4:50:53] <Dragon_Batman> I still remember how Woolie was going through Automata and Become Human at the same time and the difference is staggering
[4:50:56] <Neoripo> Smallding LUL
[4:50:56] <%CodenameChaz> Why didn't you pod jump
[4:50:58] <seer0ftime> use return
[4:50:58] <$Rumbutt> DRG not being able to get back up is pretty funny
[4:51:01] <RWLJr98> That’s just bad design tho
[4:51:02] <+Masked_Hero_Lucky> Did you get the log in the final area? There should be at least one around here
[4:51:04] <+Mindtrick_Matt> Would return work?
[4:51:05] <dds333a> what is the measure of a man, and all that
[4:51:05] <$Holycow8498> cheer500 I know you don't seem particularly interested in MMO's when i heard Pat talking about this on the podcast but what do you think of the Nier raids in this game so far Woolie?
[4:51:10] <DatAsuna> then do the cheliptoer kick
[4:51:15] <olaksi> I think 2B sees XIV people as weird aether golems instead of real humans
[4:51:19] <jaysondeez> NO
[4:51:20] <DSD24> Man I love this song
[4:51:28] <DatAsuna> you can actually squeeze out 5 jumps in automata
[4:51:28] <+Huderga> fuck
[4:51:31] <%DrJamesWoods> Most of the ones left are in the command post
[4:51:34] <jaysondeez> oh well
[4:51:35] <+krispen_wa> Isn't Minh gonna have to run through this whole place AGAIN to unlock the last raid
[4:51:48] <XrosHawk> ^ Yep
[4:51:49] <penitentpendant> @krispen_wa Yup
[4:51:50] <WanderingSwordsman> yup
[4:51:51] <+Tarviti> @olaksi Well they aren't human and not on earth so she probably wouldn't care
[4:51:53] <Neoripo> Yes
[4:51:59] <+krispen_wa> EVERGREEN CONTENT
[4:52:02] <Dragon_Batman> It was a blessing
[4:52:02] <+Maswrath> By the by, current time is 5 hours
[4:52:06] <Robot_Nixon_> if this is the bunker wouldnt this be earth?
[4:52:10] <+QueequegTheater> @Tarviti the Hyur are
[4:52:13] <Neoripo> Destination is on the elevator
[4:52:14] <%DashXero> If only Platinum could be involved with FF7R.
[4:52:16] <XrosHawk> Least it teleports you right to the raid entrance afterward
[4:52:17] <%that__tj> Go...beyond?
[4:52:17] <Solidnick18> saved the series
[4:52:22] <jaysondeez> yeah combat was not the strong suit of yoko games
[4:52:25] <+NYCrownlessKing> Woolie has it sort of dawned that 2P is technically a machine because its ability to clone like Adam and Eve and supposedly the people in white ..mean machines have evolved to the point of actually looking like humanity? @WoolieVersus
[4:52:25] <%cisealnine> Automata also saved Platinum.
[4:52:31] <%Irridium> saved the series and Platinum itself
[4:52:32] <CSeriesJTYPE> im gonna say it, the Replicant remaster is more fun to play than Automata
[4:52:34] <+snausages_> I actually much prefer Replicant's combat
[4:52:36] <dds333a> And gave Taro his first actual hit
[4:52:37] <OneThousandTomatoes> it could have been ok
[4:52:44] <%optimasmaximas> ninja theory?
[4:52:45] <%DashXero> Eh... They're all right.
[4:52:46] <%kyh9> The combat for what?
[4:52:48] <+paladinstarbuster> Its good combat for really shitball enemies
[4:52:49] <OneThousandTomatoes> but it's great
[4:52:50] <+krispen_wa> does replicant's combat actually have combo?
[4:52:53] <Neoripo> Mutual save
[4:52:53] <+QueequegTheater> @kyh9 automata
[4:52:56] <ullyzeez> CyberConnect :)
[4:52:57] <@mothmandraws> shame I just dodged +taunt 400%+ bomb spammed everything
[4:52:58] <+Tarviti> @QueequegTheater Would they not be just "human like" different sources of evolution or however the FF world came to being
[4:52:58] <Dragon_Batman> It definitely would not have been the same but yea
[4:52:58] <CSeriesJTYPE> it do combo, yes
[4:53:01] <primaryfire> replican't combat has combo yes
[4:53:01] <@mothmandraws> beat every boss instant
[4:53:02] <dds333a> Yes, Replicant has combo
[4:53:06] <maznuts> team ninja is the ninja gaiden team
[4:53:11] <AzureSynesthesia> automata already establishes that android black boxes and machine cores are the same thing
[4:53:12] <Klefth> Replicant do combo
[4:53:13] <KahnWick> Is it weird that i prefer og NieR over Automata?
[4:53:16] <%jinking79> good think someone Wake YokoTaro out of bed
[4:53:20] <datlambo458> Automata’s big flaw however is it’s bosses
[4:53:22] <+Maswrath> Also remember this is where the white yorha have been hanging out, so 2bs room was probably used by 2P
[4:53:23] <primaryfire> in replicant you can do 3 helm breakers in a row by jump and dodge cancelling
[4:53:26] <+snausages_> Replicant's is fundamentally the same systems in as OG Nier, but with more flourish to its moves. But that's OK cause a lot of the enemies are the same basic types as in Automata anyway and the sacred verses are just so good
[4:53:26] <Ks201> Wonder if they are going to play the replicant remake
[4:53:28] <$Holycow8498> Man mixing the Nier music and the music from Final Fantasy franchise is like the biggest flex in gaming
[4:53:29] <DatAsuna> @KahnWick nah I'm there with you
[4:53:29] <%bread_assassin> I hope they go back and give us a re-something for the Drakengards.
[4:53:30] <Solidnick18> yeah the combo is good in replicant the deflect is jank
[4:53:33] <+krispen_wa> OG Nier is definitely pure kino
[4:53:37] <jaysondeez> be sure to check the sides
[4:53:42] <Equirah> @KahnWick nah, the simplistic combat is part of what made the game
[4:53:46] <%kyh9> I never found Automata to be as interesting as Bayo or W101 or Astral Chain. It's good tho
[4:53:47] <+Arnschen> And lock the camera
[4:53:57] <+snausages_> Drakengard 3 getting a slight uplift would be nice, but I fear if they re-do Drakengard 3 they will lose some of the people they won over with Automata
[4:53:58] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:53:59] <+Maswrath> So that ‘poem’ may have been by 2P
[4:54:06] <dds333a> And even then, you could even play Automata exactly like other hack and slash games, and you don't even need it, but it has depth
[4:54:07] <jaysondeez> grab the destinations
[4:54:07] <primaryfire> replicant v1.22 has 3 control schemes for left and right handed use each
[4:54:08] <+QueequegTheater> There's one more
[4:54:10] <+FrostedZaibatsu> Id love a Furi and Automata mash up
[4:54:10] <+QueequegTheater> NO
[4:54:11] <mudapersona> I legit would love to see Yoko make a Drakengard sequel with all the experience he's got under his belt now
[4:54:14] <bestwaifuritsu> LUL
[4:54:14] <jaysondeez> another one
[4:54:15] <%DrJamesWoods> LUL
[4:54:20] <jaysondeez> down the stairs
[4:54:22] <@Solidus_113> into the alien ship
[4:54:23] <jaysondeez> control panels
[4:54:24] <%DrJamesWoods> Right there
[4:54:26] <+Arnschen> Continue
[4:54:27] <KaiserMario> Blind
[4:54:28] <+krispen_wa> @snausages_ if you can't get hype over dragon piss and sex jokes, are you really a fan anyways?
[4:54:32] <adithehella> other side
[4:54:35] <2DSuperiority> don't jump
[4:54:39] <+Leftovermemes> alien room
[4:54:39] <@Solidus_113> also look at the big screens
[4:54:39] <+snausages_> if they ever redo Drakengard 1 they better keep the weird classical music sampling OST
[4:54:41] <%Aeogard> @snausages_ Not even a bad thing imo, Drakengard 3 is cool because of how atypical it is to the industry imo. Same with DoD1 and 2. It just needs performance/texture help
[4:54:42] <%DrJamesWoods> don't jump
[4:54:43] <TigerClaws12> other side, Minh, another box
[4:54:44] <KnivesEve> other side
[4:54:44] <Dragon_Batman> Still good
[4:54:52] <KahnWick> Unpopular opinion: Platinum gameplay isnt even good, it just has variety
[4:54:53] <jaysondeez> whatever you do don't jump off yet
[4:54:55] <adithehella> please go to the other side
[4:54:57] <+QueequegTheater> It barely fits in at all
[4:55:00] <T_Sasquatch> I think automata doesn't reward players for playing well. There's no point to be flashy. It has alot of depth but it takes longer than just a basic combo
[4:55:00] <+paladinstarbuster> Automata's combat is good but you become so strong you cant really engage in it. No style meter makes it suck too
[4:55:03] <+NYCrownlessKing> Has it dawned that 2P is technically a machine because its ability to clone like Adam and Eve and supposedly the people in white ..mean machines have evolved to the point of actually looking like humanity? @WoolieVersus
[4:55:04] <+DreyfussFrost> I thought there were only 3 in this room? It's 4?
[4:55:05] <+krispen_wa> platinum gameplay doesnt even have variety
[4:55:07] <+snausages_> @krispen_wa honestly D3 might be my 2nd fave after Nier 1, above Automata. It's shit but I love it
[4:55:13] <Neoripo> No spam
[4:55:14] <+DreyfussFrost> Still, be thorough.
[4:55:17] <+Maswrath> I think Minh retweeted a person that went super in depth into the Ffxiv bier stuff
[4:55:24] <KnivesEve> other side minh
[4:55:27] <%HeroToxiko> didn't the aliens literally die on day one but nobody noticed because the machines kept pushing?
[4:55:38] <Robot_Nixon_> Fun? DansGame
[4:55:40] <%Irridium> man, a Drakenguard 3 port to something that can give it an actual framerate would be nice
[4:55:41] <+snausages_> THE NUT
[4:55:41] <Toni_Master43> Automata has cool combat mechanics, but the enemies are too weak or too basic to engage with the mechanics in a fun way
[4:55:42] <penitentpendant> Alimony
[4:55:42] <ullyzeez> porn folder
[4:55:43] <+Story_Ark> f is for friends
[4:55:46] <Zeif00> Kreygasm Kreygasm
[4:55:48] <%DrJamesWoods> I thought the machines killed the Aliens
[4:55:49] <+Arxel1> Kreygasm
[4:55:50] <+krispen_wa> MPREG
[4:55:51] <+QueequegTheater> Automata's biggest flaw is that there's almost nothing better for damage than just spamming basic attacks with the critical hit sticks
[4:55:51] <AllenDeadman> burf
[4:55:52] <+paladinstarbuster> I hope so
[4:55:53] <+Huderga> Robot sex
[4:55:55] <OneThousandTomatoes> pull that lever
[4:55:56] <dbag202> Humanity does it 24/7, ll we think about
[4:55:56] <Solidnick18> hmm
[4:55:56] <Klefth> Yeah, Automata's gameplay isn't that great, honestly. The balance is horrible, and since you can't really juggle every enemy, there's not that much incentive for doing combo
[4:56:04] <PinkSocks> 21O
[4:56:04] <%cobalt_phoenix_> is THIS where they started the weird baby making village?
[4:56:11] <%gatorafan> child child child MrDestructoid
[4:56:11] <%that__tj> 21O!!!
[4:56:14] <+sevorai> 21 Oh
[4:56:15] <@Solidus_113> FeelsBadMan
[4:56:15] <+krispen_wa> Automata is trivialized with the time slow on dodge chip
[4:56:18] <KaiserMario> Twenty-one Oh
[4:56:20] <AllenDeadman> 21O PogChamp
[4:56:24] <@Solidus_113> yeah
[4:56:25] <@Solidus_113> it is
[4:56:26] <bestwaifuritsu> They used our girl to pilot that boss
[4:56:28] <+mikesapartment> her data
[4:56:28] <mr_saturday93> It's more that there's no level scaling
[4:56:29] <+sevorai> 21 OH NOOOO
[4:56:29] <DatAsuna> @Klefth well also when you get too high level, everything dies before you can combo off cause of the overpowered stats
[4:56:30] <Klefth> It's a copy of her
[4:56:30] <DetroitSentai> its a copy of her
[4:56:31] <+FrostedZaibatsu> They can give birth, right?
[4:56:31] <@Solidus_113> It's her data
[4:56:31] <Dragon_Batman> It's her data
[4:56:33] <+Rafraud> BOOOOOOOOOOOO
[4:56:33] <dds333a> I'd imagine so
[4:56:34] <%CodenameChaz> They used her backup
[4:56:35] <%Aeogard> her data
[4:56:35] <AllenDeadman> it's her data
[4:56:35] <+snausages_> Trivialising combat with powerups is part of being an action RPG. Dark Wall is so fun
[4:56:35] <+Arnschen> Yes, that was her data
[4:56:36] <LordOfThePoultry> its a copy
[4:56:37] <%DrJamesWoods> just data
[4:56:37] <+NYCrownlessKing> it's her data within the tower @WoolieVersus
[4:56:38] <OneThousandTomatoes> its her data
[4:56:38] <Neoripo> It's her
[4:56:38] <Agami23> arent they ALL simulations??
[4:56:38] <+Rafraud> MAAAAAAAAAAAAAN
[4:56:42] <olaksi> Is simulation the same as the real thing with androids, who knows
[4:56:43] <+shootbang_exe> it's a copy
[4:56:43] <Applecannon63> Awwww
[4:56:43] <Agami23> they are robots
[4:56:43] <alrobot2014> oh and 210 started getting mommy crazy near the end
[4:56:46] <+Arnschen> They are all data, so it's pretty much her
[4:56:50] <artoflec> were there people dumb enough in chat saying platinum's combat wasn't good it only had variety holy cow
[4:56:51] <+NYCrownlessKing> it's her data that was ent off along within the tower @WoolieVersus
[4:56:52] <%DrJamesWoods> Nooo
[4:56:52] <+Leftovermemes> its a simulation of her
[4:56:53] <+NYCrownlessKing> was sent*
[4:56:54] <adithehella> nooooo
[4:56:55] <Dodolo212> NOOO
[4:56:57] <%that__tj> NOOO
[4:56:57] <%DrJamesWoods> LUL
[4:56:58] <OneThousandTomatoes> theyre robots its all data
[4:57:00] <Toni_Master43> if it has her memories it's her
[4:57:00] <jaysondeez> you will pass by here again
[4:57:00] <+caramelatte1> BLIND AS FUG
[4:57:01] <jaysondeez> no worries
[4:57:02] <+NYCrownlessKing> dammit Minh LUL
[4:57:02] <%cobalt_phoenix_> LUL
[4:57:04] <Parapattern> Woolie's still going huh
[4:57:05] <Klefth> @Klefth Ya, balancing issues as I said. Also the ability to carry infinity+1 healing items kinda ruins it too
[4:57:06] <ullyzeez> gun jump
[4:57:11] <AdmiralButtloaf> just read the wiki lol
[4:57:17] <bestwaifuritsu> Its definitely her. The same process of backing up 2b and 9s in new bodies was used to put her in that giant tank
[4:57:19] <KaiserMario> LUL I knew he would ignore it
[4:57:22] <+krispen_wa> Man, this is truly everygreen content
[4:57:24] <+NYCrownlessKing> it's also weird right why the Bunker has had the alien based joined? was it reconstructed by the machines? @WoolieVersus
[4:57:26] <+krispen_wa> evergreen
[4:57:30] <OkamiDude15> @alrobot2014 she just wanted a family evoCry
[4:57:31] <@Solidus_113> the best hallway in the game
[4:57:31] <%HeroToxiko> @DrJamesWoods okay i just checked, the aliens totally won, then the machines kill them.
[4:57:33] <mr_saturday93> Woolie is BIG BLIND
[4:57:36] <penitentpendant> I do like that it showed off more advanced Yorha Units during this raid
[4:57:37] <+Story_Ark> pew
[4:57:46] <$Holycow8498> Oh yeah this hallway is amazing to walk through in 14
[4:57:47] <garbageheaphound> ha
[4:57:49] <jaysondeez> I want more hallways that is death traps like this
[4:57:51] <+Maswrath> She’s how white yorha are using the bunker
[4:57:57] <jaysondeez> its so fun
[4:58:02] <+krispen_wa> Just because it's an imitation doesnt mean it cant beat the original - emiya shirou
[4:58:10] <+NYCrownlessKing> also, the machines REALLY won. because the white cloaks are basically machines @WoolieVersus
[4:58:14] <%DrJamesWoods> @HeroToxiko Yeah. That's what I was thinking, But I think Emil fought them to a standstill instead of them outright wining
[4:58:20] <+NYCrownlessKing> they were able to copy the forms of the humans of the "FF" world @WoolieVersus
[4:58:24] <jaysondeez> cutscene

[4:59:31] <PinkSocks> does he recognize it
[4:59:31] <%HeroToxiko> @HeroToxiko due to the events of nier humanity was long gone so it was just him going beast mode and the aliens probably never noticed until the machine uprising

[5:01:32] <+StonefireXIV> anyone got a link to the thread?
[5:01:33] <Dragon_Batman> I haven't seen this yet but I would just say keep going
[5:01:36] <mudapersona> @klefth oh i know lol
[5:01:37] <AllenDeadman> 1 and 3
[5:01:39] <Klefth> :)
[5:01:39] <DatAsuna> well not 2
[5:01:40] <%Zero_Jacks> @ArthurDoyleRPG lytWAH
[5:01:40] <AllenDeadman> 2 don't matter
[5:01:40] <+QueequegTheater> Drakengard 2 has no lore
[5:01:41] <%DrJamesWoods> Where's Clemps?!
[5:01:41] <+kettleroot> the weekly letters you get post raid 3 are getting pretty interesting
[5:01:42] <Toni_Master43> @zecht89 I guess he didn't do a refresher before this stream
[5:01:43] <reonome> :)
[5:01:43] <zecht89> @QueequegTheater ah ok
[5:01:43] <Agami23> no one cares about 2
[5:01:44] <%DrJamesWoods> We need Clemps
[5:01:45] <Klefth> 1 and 3
[5:01:45] <+snausages_> what is drakengard 2
[5:01:46] <+Maswrath> I know Minh retweeted it
[5:01:48] <@Solidus_113> this is the thread https://twitter.com/Crescent_Nex/status/1384554369337552897
[5:01:49] <Finakala> Drakengard 2 isn't real
[5:01:49] <ullyzeez> Drakengard 1 is Nier lore
[5:01:51] <+TombstoneTTromboners> ANOGG NO
[5:01:54] <PhazonSuited> replicant moment
[5:01:57] <Klefth> It's like DMC. It goes from 1 to 3
[5:01:57] <%zacyzacy> shiza
[5:01:58] <Applecannon63> 2 has lore but only on Caim
[5:02:01] <DatAsuna> The only thing about drakengard 2 is the song Growing Wings
[5:02:03] <Dragon_Batman> No one touches 2
[5:02:04] <+PettyFunk> There was a Drakengard 2?
[5:02:13] <adithehella> and a 3
[5:02:13] <%gatorafan> @Solidus_113 will check post-stream, thanks.
[5:02:15] <DatAsuna> That song is cash
[5:02:15] <+QueequegTheater> @Applecannon63 Also it's fake lore
[5:02:15] <Agami23> and now kannog must take annogs eye, to obtain her sharingan
[5:02:17] <@mothmandraws> watch ff14 be more plot important to yoko verse than automata
[5:02:17] <majindusto> 2 is Fiiiiiiiiiiine.
[5:02:22] <+Huderga> buh bo
[5:02:22] <$Holycow8498> Btw the composer for 14 worked on the sound teams for Drakengard 2 and 3
[5:02:24] <%Aeogard> @WoolieVersus All Drakengard/Nier lore is canon, even the stuff that leads to dead timelines/universes. Drakengard 3 confirms this.
[5:02:30] <+krispen_wa> D2 has some dragon lore i guess
[5:02:31] <%CodenameChaz> Even Yoko Taro went "fuck that shit" when it came to Draken2
[5:02:31] <prime_name> Don't you just hate cave ins?
[5:02:35] <VidulaSaix> @mothmandraws Legit it actually kind of is LUL
[5:02:35] <ClarentMordred> 2 just had nothing to do with yoko taro to my understanding
[5:02:37] <Dragon_Batman> Aww
[5:02:39] <@Solidus_113> FeelsBadMan
[5:02:39] <dbag202> oh

[5:02:44] <+ConLin_Arts_> FeelsBadMan
[5:02:44] <CoffeeSlice> o no
[5:02:45] <therakishsage> Drakengard 2 is literally fine.
[5:02:46] <MidnightSnack69> at least her arm doesnt get ripped off
[5:02:47] <LordOfThePoultry> FeelsBadMan
[5:02:48] <+RyTYoung> uh oh
[5:02:49] <mr_saturday93> Did anyone read the manga more?
[5:02:51] <Toni_Master43> @ClarentMordred He helped out in the cutscenes I think

[5:03:37] <+FrostedZaibatsu> Its 6pm over there. Streaming late?
[5:03:39] <%Alazull> Drakengard 2 is only bad because A.) It follows Drakengard B.) Uninspired script/voice acting in large swaths and C.) Disappointing multiple endings
[5:03:45] <%democrazyyy> dwarves never ever take off hats
[5:03:45] <+Masked_Hero_Lucky> Well she's tiny and got crushed so...

[5:11:34] <%Kiso52> @mothmandraws Did yall clear E11s btw? i remmeber seeing you guys progging it
[5:11:44] <DetroitSentai> The twins were already redheads before anogg fell into the seed, its more of a visual reference then anything else
[5:11:49] <+zepelinnn1> no
[5:11:50] <OneThousandTomatoes> no
[5:11:50] <jaysondeez> not really
[5:11:51] <+bluedude153> no?????
[5:11:51] <+gespenst25> NO?
[5:11:52] <+mikesapartment> no?
[5:11:52] <superbninten> no?
[5:11:54] <rosabellamelantha> no
[5:11:54] <VidulaSaix> No its just a character that has red hair
[5:11:56] <ClarentMordred> Dwarves dont take their masks off

[5:12:01] <+Rafraud> Furiae
[5:12:03] <+Huderga> it was what you said earlier
[5:12:03] <adithehella> people are just making nier references
[5:12:03] <ArthurDoyleRPG> No
[5:12:05] <+xxx420stoat69xxx> the hairstyle tho!
[5:12:05] <@mothmandraws> about 70% through
[5:12:06] <+mojopork4u> That is not a Dwarf hairstyle
[5:12:08] <DetroitSentai> The helmet fell off
[5:12:10] <+mikesapartment> It's because you said "poo poo on me" if there was a red head under there
[5:12:10] <AllenDeadman> No.... but Woolie... twins, with red hair, and green eyes
[5:12:13] <OneThousandTomatoes> its shameful
[5:12:13] <DetroitSentai> So it wasnt copied
[5:12:13] <rosabellamelantha> redhead twins
[5:12:15] <%DrJamesWoods> Red-headed twins in a Nier related thing I think is what people are getting at
[5:12:18] <+QueequegTheater> Breaking an extremely ingrained cultural taboo
[5:12:19] <+Rafraud> Drakengard girl?
[5:12:20] <ClarentMordred> also yeah furiae
[5:12:24] <%SkellyVee> twins
[5:12:24] <+sevorai> red head twins with green eyes
[5:12:25] <+Rafraud> Furiae
[5:12:26] <AdmiralButtloaf> redheaded twins
[5:12:27] <+bluedude153> im fucking dead
[5:12:29] <JanusII> You can show your face to your family.
[5:12:29] <majindusto> It's not a beard...It's a scarf
[5:12:30] <Iwashi94> @WoolieVersus you were joking about Devola and Popola earlier
[5:12:30] <+caramelatte1> EVER PLAYED NIER?
[5:12:32] <PinkSocks> She's more like Furiae than devopopo
[5:12:33] <+RoByte2> Not just a tradition, take your helmet off and you get exiled
[5:12:34] <stormhawk9891> @WoolieVersus You were complaining about red heads earlier
[5:12:34] <+xxx420stoat69xxx> yeah it's significant
[5:12:35] <+OblivionSword1> that and Furiae
[5:12:35] <deadbeat34> because you talked shit earlier
[5:12:35] <JanusII> People are reacting to redhead twins.
[5:12:36] <reonome> you were talking about redheads earlier woolie
[5:12:38] <prime_name> What other Nier characters have red hair?
[5:12:38] <+R0DA> he even SAID if they had red hair!!
[5:12:38] <Ks201> In the first they are not supposed to show there faces to outsiders
[5:12:39] <2DSuperiority> what other red hair twins
[5:12:41] <VidulaSaix> Chat's basically shitting on you because of your earlier comments
[5:12:42] <Riorii> sweet 5.5 quests now
[5:12:42] <+paladinstarbuster> ted haired twins
[5:12:44] <+NYCrownlessKing> i think the point is just Furiae was a red head and it's the implication of choosing this specific character to be redheaded
[5:12:44] <Solidnick18> devola and popola?
[5:12:44] <seer0ftime> WOOLIE THEY'RE DEVOLA AND POPOLA
[5:12:46] <+Masked_Hero_Lucky> Removing the helmet in front of anyone but family is serious enough to warrant banishment
[5:12:46] <Dragon_Batman> Furiae had brown hair tho

[5:15:08] <+that__tj> Lore important Dwarves eh? Good Bit
[5:15:08] <2Bs_USB_port> that would make 0 sense
[5:15:09] <PhazonSuited> LUL

[5:15:34] <+ClericOfSparda> The dwarves are not Devil's and Popola
[5:15:36] <+SouLucha> They'll leave it open ended so they can later push them into the lifestream.
[5:15:37] <LycheeMusings> woolieLORE IMPORTANT woolieLORE
[5:15:38] <%kewlmyc> Poor potato
[5:15:39] <+R0DA> Oh look at that straight cut red hair from a twin with fluffy red hair
[5:15:42] <%KetsuoTaberu> yup that's red alright
[5:15:46] <%deadbeat34> that is a VERY specific shade of red.
[5:15:46] <+CptBritches> Would you really expect Taro to not do SOMETHING wacky with the dwarves?
[5:15:46] <Neoripo> TBH i never made the connection
[5:15:48] <heartlesshealer> Devil's...
[5:15:50] <DetroitSentai> Yes they were red headed twins as a reference
[5:15:59] <+sevorai> its jsut a reference thing tbh
[5:16:02] <+ClericOfSparda> @heartlesshealer autocorrect sucks
[5:16:03] <%ShaolinWanderer> Wait so he’s just watching gameplay? Of the neir stuff or what?

[5:16:12] <+ConLin_Arts_> sbfpSetIn
[5:16:16] <+DreyfussFrost> The reason to care about the dumb dwarf adventures is that the dwarves are awesome. Anybody that hasn't done their dailies should get on that, they're Shadowbringers' Hildibrand.
[5:16:16] <+R0DA> It's jsut a reference
[5:16:17] <+QueequegTheater> He just can't let it go
[5:16:17] <VidulaSaix> It's just a cool easter egg
[5:16:18] <@Solidus_113> I know writers who use subtext, they're COWARDS
[5:16:18] <+ClericOfSparda> We are in theory world
[5:16:20] <%CodenameChaz> It's an extremely subtle thing
[5:16:21] <penitentpendant> To the dig site chief!
[5:16:22] <+sevorai> just a reference lol

[5:18:51] <Zeif00> Dark Colossus
[5:18:52] <2DSuperiority> Dark Colossus
[5:18:52] <BluBox> Dark Colossus

[5:19:01] <%MisterRockett> WOOLIE PLEASE PAY ATTENTION TO THE MUSIC Xd
[5:19:03] <+Leftovermemes> dark colossus and torn from the heavens
[5:19:03] <+notgarza> “Become as gods when?”
[5:19:04] <neostria> BETTER PLAY IT AGAIN
[5:19:06] <inksmears> the best one is the first one anyway
[5:19:09] <+zepelinnn1> !HEARING AT RISK!
[5:19:09] <Lieutori> Big Nier fan Woolie
[5:19:12] <majindusto> DARK COLOSSUS DESTROYS ALL
[5:19:16] <Zayasu> not sure why people get so angry over stuff like this LUL
[5:19:16] <+QueequegTheater> @inksmears 3rd one tho
[5:19:16] <+snausages_> But it had a heavy FFXIV emphasis, and Dark Collosus is more synonymous with the first game anyway
[5:19:17] <shorololo> well you both talked over it
[5:19:19] <+SouLucha> DON'T LET IT SET IN
[5:19:20] <+mojopork4u> !HEARING AT RISK!
[5:19:21] <+ClericOfSparda> yeah
[5:19:22] <datlambo458> Next one won’t be missable luckily
[5:19:23] <+Huderga> woolie loves nier
[5:19:25] <+sevorai> relax, lmao its not that serious. just correct him and call it a day jesus
[5:19:26] <$Holycow8498> That's fair
[5:19:26] <gunstars20> Why are people mad at this
[5:19:28] <%that__tj> Poopoo!
[5:19:28] <+ClericOfSparda> I forget a lot of them too
[5:19:30] <Felto3> dark collossus is the least emorable of the 3 final boss tunes
[5:19:32] <penitentpendant> Dark Colossus isn't that popular compared to others
[5:19:33] <Neoripo> Shit happens
[5:19:33] <Srthunda> people who remember music are the worst, forget like the rest of us
[5:19:34] <inksmears> @QueequegTheater fair LUL
[5:19:35] <OneThousandTomatoes> are you telling me your dont remember ever song youve ever heard?
[5:19:35] <Dragon_Batman> It was the giant machine in the flooded city theme
[5:19:36] <Felto3> memorable*
[5:19:37] <+Nobrev> chat turn down the heat goddamn
[5:19:38] <Zayasu> chill chat... LUL
[5:19:38] <+Kyma1020> It's ok Woolie
[5:19:38] <+SouLucha> LUL
[5:19:40] <Louie_Salmon> It's been a hot minute
[5:19:44] <+ConLin_Arts_> monkaS
[5:19:46] <dbag202> bobbas
[5:19:48] <ClarentMordred> It's still p funny tho ngl :oroLUL: but yeah its understandbale
[5:19:48] <Dragon_Batman> Fair
[5:19:49] <+mojopork4u> @gunstars20 We're just giving him shit after his 3 hour sandbag, no biggie LUL
[5:19:51] <$arcielardor> fat chocobo theme is the perfect compliment to Woolie's lack of interest.
[5:19:53] <Tracazoid> But Woolie why didn't you go through a 40 hour game in prep Kappa
[5:19:54] <PinkSocks> Originally the village in Nier being attacked
[5:19:55] <%gatorafan> Here I go killing again - 2E
[5:19:57] <+Dwarven_Gaming> 9s rides a missile to hit it
[5:19:58] <%ShaolinWanderer> Ahhh it is the Neir content I see now
[5:19:58] <vVAstrAVv> imagine not memorizing every track title
[5:20:06] <datlambo458> Your telling me you don’t actively listen to every song from Nier/drakenguard every day? For shame
[5:20:08] <$Kekon3> The song was just an ffxiv song remixed to sound like nier
[5:20:11] <dds333a> FAKE FAN Kappa
[5:20:11] <Dragon_Batman> There was a lot to take in to be fair
[5:20:11] <JanusII> You don't listen to the Nier soundtrack 24/7? Fake fan. Kappa
[5:20:14] <+SouLucha> Whelp time to listen to all of Automata's and Replican's osts!
[5:20:15] <majindusto> GIANT WHALE MACHINE
[5:20:16] <+QueequegTheater> Oh, you say you're a Nier fan? Name every shade Kappa
[5:20:29] <DetroitSentai> no
[5:20:32] <%Aeogard> no
[5:20:35] <jaysondeez> yeah

[5:20:41] <+xp194> The Final Fantasy part is a lot more prominant in that one, yeagh
[5:20:42] <+Arnschen> It's split up in patches
[5:20:43] <+QueequegTheater> No, it cuts off in the middle
[5:20:45] <%ShaolinWanderer> I’m a Nier fan and I haven’t even played it lmaoooo you don’t have to consume the content to like something
[5:20:46] <+NYCrownlessKing> there are always 3 raids. for each expansion. but this one has a unique weekly quests @WoolieVersus
[5:20:47] <OneThousandTomatoes> oh
[5:20:48] <Floofiie> @QueequegTheater I'm a shade :)
[5:20:49] <%MisterRockett> @QueequegTheater Michelangelo. Donatello. Raphaelle. Leonardo.
[5:20:50] <penitentpendant> He's now in the "Lead in" to Raid 3
[5:20:52] <+zepelinnn1> Oh you are a Nier fan? How big is Kaine's cock?
[5:20:53] <+mojopork4u> It cuts all over the place @WoolieVersus
[5:20:53] <+mikesapartment> this is part of the 3rd act
[5:20:55] <OneThousandTomatoes> this was 5.4
[5:20:56] <+DreyfussFrost> @WoolieVersus This whole questline is split into 5 sections. Raid, filler patch, raid, filler patch, raid.
[5:20:56] <+Mondeiya> iirc revisiting the raid map is like an interim between raid patches
[5:20:56] <%dios_happy_hour> We're in part 3
[5:20:57] <+RoByte2> The cutoff point for 2 to 3 was finding the seed
[5:21:00] <2DSuperiority> this is 5.5
[5:21:01] <Neoripo> You have 1 more quest after the raid
[5:21:01] <+xxx420stoat69xxx> next quest is the raid
[5:21:02] <+Graxe_> Three months between patches
[5:21:04] <%dios_happy_hour> orb
[5:21:04] <+wunp_fxs> coolest raid coming up
[5:21:08] <%kewlmyc> How many raids were there?
[5:21:08] <+Masked_Hero_Lucky> You're almost to the third raid now
[5:21:09] <OneThousandTomatoes> the seed is 5.4
[5:21:10] <DetroitSentai> Seed flashback wasnt the end of 2, it was in between 2 and 3
[5:21:10] <PhazonSuited> this quest and the previous one were added between the second and third raids coming out
[5:21:12] <jaysondeez> because you are doing this back to back its hard to tell where it begins and ends
[5:21:16] <+sevorai> @WoolieVersus it stops a little bit after a couple of quests after the raid usually
[5:21:18] <+mojopork4u> The quest cutoffs are all over the place There are 3 parts and 2 intermissions and it's hard to gauge where things open and end @WoolieVersus
[5:21:21] <Dragon_Batman> Yea he's getting it in one go
[5:21:21] <Riorii> This quest is the first quest of the latest patch @WoolieVersus
[5:21:24] <+bluedude153> mad mad mad
[5:21:27] <+Graxe_> Raids came out in 5.1, 5.3, and 5.5
[5:21:28] <+ConLin_Arts_> it doesn't really matter where one starts and ends
[5:21:37] <$Kekon3> The egg was a cliffhanger
[5:21:41] <DetroitSentai> @Graxe_ but they added lore quests in 5.23 and 5.4
[5:21:43] <+DreyfussFrost> @WoolieVersus Every time the NPCs tell you to "come back later" that's the end of a patch. It's how they justify the wait in-universe.
[5:21:51] <+GingerStrawhat> Like Pat says, once you finish new content you unsubcribe and then come back
[5:21:54] <%CodenameChaz> Yep. They did the raids on major patches and then in between added secondary quests on off-raid patches
[5:21:55] <Neoripo> Doooooomed!!!
[5:21:56] <+NYCrownlessKing> and now there is a uniquely weekly quest after the end of the 3rd raid that is literally giving the smallest itty bitty pieces of lore that we have no idea whats the ending pay off @WoolieVersus
[5:22:00] <+jaggstar2020> white chlorination levels rising
[5:22:05] <+NYCrownlessKing> its very miniscule
[5:22:05] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[5:22:06] <%keiji_maede> lol
[5:22:06] <+Story_Ark> groose?
[5:22:07] <neostria> this music LUL
[5:22:09] <+GingerStrawhat> Fucking love that fat chocobo
[5:22:11] <+xxx420stoat69xxx> chonk
[5:22:16] <thebalticguy1> SALT
[5:22:32] <+GingerStrawhat> MMO's the enemy of Lets Plays
[5:22:38] <+snausages_> Woolie how are you finding the lore stuff so far
[5:22:42] <Srthunda> fast
[5:22:43] <OneThousandTomatoes> habit too
[5:22:44] <Neoripo> The Choncobo
[5:22:45] <+DreyfussFrost> @WoolieVersus For context, you're currently in the filler from the patch between the second and third raids.
[5:22:45] <+dotrook> efficiency!
[5:22:48] <JanusII> It's technically faster.
[5:22:48] <+Story_Ark> save 5 seconds
[5:22:52] <dds333a> Pretty much Minh LUL
[5:22:53] <+GingerStrawhat> It saves you .5 seconds woolie!
[5:22:54] <neostria> it becomes a habit after some point
[5:22:54] <OneThousandTomatoes> dont have to deal with enemies
[5:22:55] <SomersaultJustice> you know when you take the car to another shop in the same shopping center?
[5:22:56] <Dragon_Batman> LUL that efficiency
[5:22:57] <DetroitSentai> It adds up
[5:23:29] <%democrazyyy> why wouldn't they look there first
[5:23:58] <majindusto> enigmaSweat
[5:24:21] <Neoripo> There are some 4th wall breaking jokes in XIV
[5:24:31] <WanderingSwordsman> we're heading in boys
[5:24:32] <Dragon_Batman> Which I guess is fair cuz the raid was like a huge amount of months ago right?
[5:24:35] <@Solidus_113> yep
[5:24:38] <JanusII> It's a double meaning.
[5:24:40] <DetroitSentai> MSQ has solo fights
[5:24:41] <+MTLxSpider> yes
[5:24:42] <jaysondeez> part of the story
[5:24:43] <%LouieRouie> Sort of
[5:24:43] <OneThousandTomatoes> yeah
[5:24:46] <SomersaultJustice> duties
[5:24:47] <penitentpendant> Yup, there's a lot of solo story bits
[5:24:48] <AzureSynesthesia> kinda
[5:24:48] <+caramelatte1> Solo duties
[5:24:50] <+xxx420stoat69xxx> some story content yesh
[5:24:50] <2Bs_USB_port> they suck
[5:24:51] <jaysondeez> but most content is party
[5:24:52] <ClarentMordred> less 4th wall breaking and more by this point warrior of light has seen some shit
[5:24:53] <+Huderga> @Neoripo there's a fate called metal gear rising revengence iirc
[5:24:53] <+Arnschen> A bunch
[5:24:54] <+DreyfussFrost> @WoolieVersus These sections between the raids are long because alliance raids only come out every other major patch. So on the major patches in between they released a little bit of filler so when players come back for the next raid the players only need to remember what happened 3 months ago instead of 6 months ago.
[5:24:55] <OneThousandTomatoes> no
[5:24:56] <+GingerStrawhat> Hell no
[5:24:56] <Neoripo> Half
[5:25:06] <+mikesapartment> moving forward, you can do dungeons with npc homies
[5:25:08] <+Masked_Hero_Lucky> Dungeons are whatever IMO, it's the boss fights I really enjoy
[5:25:10] <ClarentMordred> most of the actual content is 4 man and 8 man instances @WoolieVersus
[5:25:12] <Felto3> mostly 4-man or 8-man content
[5:25:13] <jaysondeez> Story will have solo duties, but there are still four man dungeons and 8 man trials for the main story
[5:25:18] <+xxx420stoat69xxx> most stuff is 4 man parties
[5:25:20] <%call_me_comic> are there still FATEs?
[5:25:20] <Neoripo> Half solo half 4 player dungeons
[5:25:26] <$Kekon3> Story mode is a mixture of 4 player and 1
[5:25:29] <NeonBleu> AI are slow tho
[5:25:29] <%democrazyyy> only for the new expansions so far though
[5:25:29] <+GingerStrawhat> Unless your TOR your do most stuff with a bunch of people around you
[5:25:30] <DetroitSentai> They're story characters specifically
[5:25:31] <+xxx420stoat69xxx> the AI SUCKS though
[5:25:34] <neostria> technically if you just want main story you dont raid much
[5:25:35] <WanderingSwordsman> fates are still a thing
[5:25:35] <%Irridium> that's only for Shadowbringers
[5:25:36] <OneThousandTomatoes> i hope they make it so you dont have to lvl trusts
[5:25:38] <+inkandamber> Oh god I forgot about HIM. I'm out.
[5:25:41] <%Aeogard> Only for recent dungeons!
[5:25:41] <+DreyfussFrost> @WoolieVersus Leveling from 1 to cap is mostly single player, but once you're at max level almost everything is multiplayer.
[5:25:45] <OneThousandTomatoes> theyre not horrible
[5:25:47] <+terry_quest> they cant aoe
[5:25:47] <twoto858> They do the job, but they're really slow
[5:25:47] <Srthunda> they go at a specific pace
[5:25:48] <AllenDeadman> they will at least do the mechanics
[5:25:48] <pixelkenj> never socialize
[5:25:49] <AzureSynesthesia> yeah its super slow
[5:25:49] <PhazonSuited> they single pull
[5:25:49] <+mikesapartment> they're great, but slow
[5:25:55] <lucky_icarus> The AI is better than A LOT of players tho
[5:25:55] <+Castle_Kundarak> Not deliberate mistakes. Just not as fast as players
[5:25:56] <+NYCrownlessKing> players just know how to optimize @WoolieVersus
[5:25:56] <VidulaSaix> Yes
[5:25:57] <boltstrykex> they do the job
[5:25:57] <Tracazoid> A.I. add like 30 minutes to a dungeon
[5:25:58] <OneThousandTomatoes> they dont do aoe
[5:25:58] <iosephe> No rez
[5:25:58] <+TombstoneTTromboners> it's good for the first run, just for story and unique dialogue
[5:25:59] <+MTLxSpider> yes
[5:25:59] <+dotrook> they do single target, not aoe
[5:25:59] <jaysondeez> they heal
[5:25:59] <+gutlesscoward> it's not that they make mistakes, they just go slowly
[5:26:00] <+xxx420stoat69xxx> players are objectively better
[5:26:01] <@Solidus_113> yeah
[5:26:01] <PinkSocks> You can't die
[5:26:02] <DetroitSentai> yeah they're solid, just slow
[5:26:02] <jaysondeez> but they do not raise
[5:26:03] <mr_red117> yes
[5:26:05] <+MTLxSpider> if you die. YOU DIE
[5:26:05] <+NYCrownlessKing> AI's are built to sort of let you experience all mechanics @WoolieVersus
[5:26:06] <%Irridium> but I don't want to play with others
[5:26:06] <boltstrykex> yes they're fine
[5:26:07] <%Aeogard> yeah theyre really good
[5:26:10] <jaysondeez> if you die you you die
[5:26:10] <Riorii> if you die whole party wipes
[5:26:11] <$Rumbutt> if you die it's a wipe when you're solo
[5:26:12] <olaksi> AI forces you to play slow, they do mechanics reliably though
[5:26:12] <+dotrook> but otherwise, they're actually more competent than regular players
[5:26:12] <+terry_quest> if they could AOE it would be amazing
[5:26:12] <mr_red117> they do the job right but slow
[5:26:13] <+Docblargle> the ai have poor dps but do mechanics great
[5:26:13] <+Graxe_> If you die, you wipe
[5:26:14] <ClarentMordred> theyre not horrible they just are slow cause players do a bunch of time saving strats and sometimes cheese mechanics
[5:26:14] <+dotrook> theyre just slower
[5:26:16] <Felto3> if you die, you return to the start of the dungeon
[5:26:17] <%deadbeat34> ffxiv runs on dark souls rules in terms of its msq. your progress is your own, but others can help
[5:26:19] <ClarentMordred> which they dont do
[5:26:20] <Neoripo> They do the gob, slowly
[5:26:20] <PhazonSuited> you can make a 10-15 minute dungeon take 40 minutes
[5:26:23] <+Kyma1020> They do the job depending on what role you're playing
[5:26:24] <speximillian> The AI actually have more DPS
[5:26:27] <+AnActualHermitCrab> They do fight mechanics perfect and that's nice, but there's no replacing an actual player's DPS and healing.
[5:26:30] <jaysondeez> yeah its no pressure way to learn the dungeon mechanics
[5:26:33] <+Maswrath> They do the job, but slow
[5:26:34] <+jaggstar2020> people die if their HP reaches zero.
[5:26:34] <%CodenameChaz> Their only down side is they don't aoe, so it's them just pinging enemies one at a time, which is part of why it feels so slow
[5:26:35] <+GingerStrawhat> I always wanted to get into FF14 but I'm just bad at making friends and doing this group stuff
[5:26:38] <%Aeogard> groups of 4 not 8 or 24
[5:26:38] <ArthurDoyleRPG> AI are good, they just don't AOE
[5:26:39] <iosephe> It's only 3 AI, plus you
[5:26:40] <HollowMan190> playing an mmo solo just sounds depressing
[5:26:43] <Neoripo> 4 player dungeons
[5:26:47] <$Kekon3> If an AI makes a mistake, it’s lore or an Easter egg
[5:26:48] <Ianrazz> They are intentionally slow so it doesn't substitute playing with real people. It's a built in drawback
[5:26:50] <jaysondeez> Dungeons = 4 man Trials and normal raids = 8 man Alliance raids = 24 man
[5:26:56] <2DSuperiority> dungeons are 4 people, alliance raid is 24, normal raids are 8
[5:26:59] <JanusII> 3rd time not opening that. nemuLUL
[5:27:11] <@Solidus_113> we already read it it's fine
[5:27:25] <Neoripo> And the music is sick
[5:27:26] <DetroitSentai> Alliance meaning 24 person
[5:27:29] <JanusII> I'm sure Minh has it on main anywho.
[5:27:31] <+dotrook> the ai party members are mainly for story progression dungeons in shadowbringers. but there is seperate ai system where you level a personal npc squad for dungeons before that.
[5:27:31] <%Kiso52> ultimate raids!
[5:27:32] <+DreyfussFrost> Alliance = 3 parties of 8
[5:27:46] <Dragon_Batman> MAkes sense
[5:28:06] <+DreyfussFrost> Alliance raids also only come in normal (easy) difficulty. 8 man content gets MUCH harder than this.
[5:28:10] <%democrazyyy> for the horde and all that SMOrc
[5:28:13] <Ianrazz> Man if the AI trust system was really fast, it would probably fuck up the queue times in a really bad way
[5:28:23] <+KawaiiJetty> I wish I could bring my squadron instead of trust
[5:28:25] <+ConLin_Arts_> sbfpYeyeye sbfpYeyeye sbfpYeyeye
[5:28:27] <DetroitSentai> @dotrook i dont think you can realistically unlock squadrons to do the dungeons they have available for your first go though

[5:31:57] <VidulaSaix> No time aka yoko didnt write it LUL
[5:31:59] <dds333a> "Grandma" is a leitmotif
[5:31:59] <+yukichocomilk> THERE IS NO TIME
[5:32:00] <+KawaiiJetty> There's no time though
[5:32:02] <%baronblank> THERE'S NO TIME
[5:32:03] <+jaggstar2020> To understand you have to replay shadowbringers at least 3 more times.
[5:32:07] <gunstars20> NO TIME
[5:32:08] <%democrazyyy> the theme of determination
[5:32:08] <dds333a> With several different versions
[5:32:12] <OneThousandTomatoes> ye sure
[5:32:13] <+Rafraud> But if seeds make things to destroy humans, why is the annogg copy a good?
[5:32:17] <HolyGriddles> Is this some kind of FF x Nier crossover?
[5:32:17] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Paranoid_Jumbotron

[5:32:28] <+Dwarven_Gaming> seriously, this 9s feels OFF considerig the ending
[5:32:34] <mr_saturday93> So shouldn't 9S be freaking out over seeing REAL humans rn?
[5:32:40] <OneThousandTomatoes> @holygriddles yes thats exactly what it is
[5:32:52] <+MagiKestral> @mr_saturday93 you call lalafels real humans?
[5:32:53] <%kewlmyc> @Dwarven_Gaming I could see him calming the fuck down once 2B was back
[5:32:54] <olaksi> Seems like 9S got the ol' factory reset again
[5:32:54] <%deadbeat34> 9s wants to go to the Golden Saucer
[5:32:55] <PinkSocks> ff14 races aren't "real humans"
[5:32:58] <ArthurDoyleRPG> @mr_saturday93 No humans there Kappa
[5:32:58] <Srthunda> lalafells arent humans
[5:33:00] <rasseabreeze> @mr_saturday93 well there's no humans present in the cutscene
[5:33:00] <+yukichocomilk> @mr_saturday93 what humans? LUL
[5:33:02] <Paranoid_Jumbotron> @mr_saturday93 technically its hyurs and lalafells hehe
[5:33:08] <Agami23> @mr_saturday93 there are no humans in ff14
[5:33:15] <2DSuperiority> no even the human races aren't human
[5:33:18] <+TombstoneTTromboners> anogg is an anomaly
[5:33:20] <@Solidus_113> FF14 world doesn't really fit the exact data Yorha had on what humans are
[5:33:21] <mr_saturday93> @magikestral well if the player was a real human assuming
[5:33:22] <%Javaa01> @mr_saturday93 These are just real Potatoes, they aren't tall enough for human rights
[5:33:23] <FennecZephyr> Does that imply that all the 14 races are all replicants>?
[5:33:27] <%Aeogard> keep going :)
[5:33:31] <+genowyn> bwong
[5:33:33] <mr_saturday93> Wait no humans?
[5:33:35] <+Tarviti> @Rafraud I think it's implied that, that was a fake seed and only retains the seeds copy/creation abilities while lacking its evolution/information transfer abilities.
[5:33:36] <%SkellyVee> letssssss goooooo
[5:33:36] <olaksi> androids are VERY particular about what constitutes human
[5:33:37] <Paranoid_Jumbotron> @FennecZephyr not even a lil bit lol

[5:42:30] <rei0> wow that rescue
[5:42:32] <Srthunda> people thought the opposite on release, and hid behind
[5:42:35] <Agami23> skull no
[5:42:35] <+Rafraud> Yeah
[5:42:36] <+TombstoneTTromboners> emil literally created an army of himselves and lost his mind in the process
[5:42:36] <Zebroneath> That rescue, hoo boy
[5:42:37] <PinkSocks> Emil wants to die in automata
[5:42:37] <VidulaSaix> And they end up self destructing yep
[5:42:38] <%fetrigon> ye
[5:42:39] <AllenDeadman> basically yeah
[5:42:39] <+NYCrownlessKing> yeah
[5:42:40] <%kewlmyc> Yep
[5:42:41] <prime_name> basically
[5:42:41] <+mojopork4u> No and yes
[5:42:42] <+Caidezes> Yup.
[5:42:42] <Dragon_Batman> The og Emil is there too as well as the copies he made
[5:42:42] <+GingerStrawhat> No Emil is probably dead
[5:42:43] <Ninoace> yes
[5:42:43] <Solidnick18> i think so
[5:42:43] <Toni_Master43> pretty much yeah
[5:42:43] <+Rafraud> He wants to die hard
[5:42:44] <Paranoid_Jumbotron> he had to make copies to fight the aliens
[5:42:44] <EL_TRO> yes
[5:42:47] <+Dwarven_Gaming> yes
[5:42:47] <%gatorafan> close enough
[5:42:47] <OneThousandTomatoes> so many hid behind them on patch day
[5:42:49] <bestwaifuritsu> Emil defeated the Aliens
[5:42:49] <olaksi> Everyone assumes you are supposed to hide behind the boxes at first too, it's basically a mechanic designed to troll 14 players
[5:42:50] <PhazonSuited> yes, kind of like V's demons, they are his trauma and despair
[5:42:52] <+GingerStrawhat> The one in Automatta is probably a clone of him
[5:42:52] <Neoripo> More or less
[5:42:54] <+xxx420stoat69xxx> do it skull! do the rescue!
[5:42:54] <VidulaSaix> Yep
[5:42:55] <+mojopork4u> No
[5:42:55] <majindusto> Did you fight the shop emil?
[5:42:56] <+KawaiiJetty> day 1 was tragic with Lunge LUL
[5:42:57] <+Rafraud> OG Emil is gone at that point is the implication I think
[5:42:58] <feralspidey> Woolie, life is more than failure and exosure.
[5:42:59] <Tracazoid> Yeah, to fight the alien war it fragmented his memory by making millions of copies
[5:43:00] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah he wasn't having a great time
[5:43:01] <+PettyFunk> Emil doesn’t even know which him is the original
[5:43:01] <Dragon_Batman> Ening Y is letting him self destruct
[5:43:02] <%Garthunox> and he finally remembers his friends
[5:43:02] <nobody287> it's not implied
[5:43:03] <+Kyma1020> yup
[5:43:04] <EL_TRO> saddest shit
[5:43:05] <heartlesshealer> Yes and no. They are sick and tired of immortality and fighting. They hate the world and want everything to stop
[5:43:06] <+NYCrownlessKing> we never know who is the true emil so sure maybe his COPIES die? @WoolieVersus
[5:43:06] <+Veraverse> NOT THIS SONG
[5:43:07] <OkamiDude15> @maznuts thats the big shade that attacks the town in og nier. the one you lock in the basement of the library.
[5:43:07] <+wunp_fxs> this music
[5:43:08] <+Veraverse> NOOOOO
[5:43:08] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[5:43:09] <OneThousandTomatoes> what does that hez say?
[5:43:09] <+Rafraud> Its more what's left of his concisouness
[5:43:10] <+fugatlas> the emil that you've been with the entire game reveals that no one really knows what happened to the real emil after so many copies were made
[5:43:12] <brachydios777> I feel the Androids would freak their shit if they found out about the Gestalts/Shades and what they were
[5:43:13] <+fugatlas> he's just gone
[5:43:18] <+MagiKestral> I am willing to bet the emil from automata is the real one. just cause it's dramatic irony like that
[5:43:19] <@Menitta> oh no
[5:43:22] <+Veraverse> This song is so sad
[5:43:23] <+Rafraud> That one is super fine to miss lol
[5:43:23] <Neoripo> This song nooooooo!!
[5:43:23] <mudapersona> Replay Automata after Replicant
[5:43:25] <+Veraverse> I'm sad
[5:43:27] <+Rafraud> It is important tho
[5:43:28] <maznuts> oh damn
[5:43:29] <$Holycow8498> Have you shown Woolie some of the outfits he might like the healing and casting top since he played Nier
[5:43:31] <+kuro_xvi> Here it comes :)
[5:43:37] <%Major_Lee_> map has a 14 on it
[5:43:38] <+MostRefinedCalla> I mean he died in the original sooooooo one of his clones could still be alive
[5:43:39] <+AnActualHermitCrab> This track is so damn good.
[5:43:39] <%ConflagrationsGaming> This track really is just, rough
[5:43:40] <+KawaiiJetty> I am glad they picked this music
[5:43:42] <Agami23> time for more pogs
[5:43:43] <%Alazull> GLHF
[5:43:44] <Tracazoid> Well Emil might be dead, nobody knows where the original is by Automata
[5:43:46] <%ConflagrationsGaming> Mourning is a rough track for me
[5:43:47] <%jinking79> yeah he finally get to rest
[5:43:49] <VidulaSaix> MORE NIER 1!
[5:43:50] <%fetrigon> oh boy KomodoHype
[5:43:51] <+AnActualHermitCrab> "Mourning" is the track name, for those curious.

[5:44:15] <+Rafraud> Its literally just them
[5:44:15] <reonome> SourPls
[5:44:16] <%bread_assassin> Does the Emil we see end up being the OG Emil? He says he's a copy, but the description in the archives you get after beating the boss implies he's the original, IIRC.
[5:44:16] <LordOfThePoultry> SourPls SourPls SourPls SourPls SourPls
[5:44:16] <maznuts> WHERE IN OH NIER NOW BOIS

[5:44:24] <Ninoace> SourPls
[5:44:27] <+Masked_Hero_Lucky> Emil getting to die is a happy ending after 10000+ years of sadness and being alone.
[5:44:27] <+KawaiiJetty> Ans this is my least favorite boss of the raid sadly LUL
[5:44:33] <+Rafraud> THE GOONS
[5:44:34] <elyeuphoria> SourPls
[5:44:36] <Paranoid_Jumbotron> they even have their shields
[5:44:37] <Alice_Lufenia> this boss is HARD
[5:44:41] <+shootbang_exe> z-targeting the nostalgia gland
[5:44:42] <OneThousandTomatoes> it was funny seing people playing replicant and be like "hey look its that ffxiv boss"
[5:44:43] <Agami23> dancers are deadly in this fight
[5:44:44] <Dragon_Batman> Yo that' great
[5:44:44] <Solidnick18> i mean just fought them recently
[5:44:48] <dbag202> Song of the Ancient I hear?
[5:44:49] <%kewlmyc> Nostalgia for a game he didn't play LUL I'm the same though.
[5:44:51] <Thepothero> This fuckin song BibleThump
[5:44:51] <+Nobrev> they even have the same shield gimmick as in NieR
[5:44:52] <Srthunda> I love these two
[5:44:53] <%CodenameChaz> They get fucked *super hard* each time too
[5:44:54] <$Holycow8498> I saw this boss fight in Nier 1 and i love how they mangaed to implement some of the fights mechanics from that game into an MMO
[5:44:55] <+RyTYoung> yeah they're DOPE
[5:44:58] <Solidnick18> replicant
[5:45:01] <+teg88> You just basically have to keep an eye on the jets of their spears
[5:45:01] <Solidnick18> is great
[5:45:01] <+GingerStrawhat> Well one of them is great
[5:45:03] <+RyTYoung> NieR Replicant is DOPE
[5:45:07] <JanusII> I just fought them in Replicant yesterday, haha.
[5:45:07] <primaryfire> well you replay the game a few times so ye
[5:45:07] <VidulaSaix> I'm really hoping you decide to do a Reggie VS Replicant LP cause god damn
[5:45:09] <OneThousandTomatoes> uptime
[5:45:10] <FunnyCrimes> speaking of in the middle of runs im in the middle of my automata run guys so i sure am loving all these secret ending spoilers
[5:45:14] <%Zero_Jacks> SourPls SourPls
[5:45:16] <bestwaifuritsu> Austin dead LUL
[5:45:17] <+GingerStrawhat> Aw you lucky SOB Mihn, I missed out on that
[5:45:20] <%jinking79> maps spells xiv in this raid?
[5:45:20] <heartlesshealer> Minh's gonna find 300 eagle eggs
[5:45:26] <iosephe> isn't that area always dangerous?
[5:45:29] <OneThousandTomatoes> it spells 14
[5:45:36] <+mojopork4u> Theyre a part of an ego
[5:45:39] <2DSuperiority> depends on the where they hold the axes
[5:45:40] <+mojopork4u> Hence enter the ego
[5:45:40] <zecht89> Is Woolie going to play the remake?
[5:45:41] <VidulaSaix> Just generic number strings you can see it in chat
[5:45:45] <+caramelatte1> Just the standard 210p or w/e
[5:45:53] <+mikesapartment> you didnt fight 2 of the puppets in the second raid, thats what the first 2 bosses are
[5:45:54] <+Graxe_> It's just android names, yeah
[5:45:59] <+Nobrev> aren't their names in hex code?
[5:46:01] <%democrazyyy> it was the yorha who showed up with 2P. they all have designations ending with P but they only have a few lines over the fights
[5:46:01] <OneThousandTomatoes> why mign
[5:46:04] <LordOfThePoultry> LUL
[5:46:04] <plushysceptile> Minh's dead

[5:46:11] <PhazonSuited> drg moment again
[5:46:11] <Saltmeisterr> GET FUCKED
[5:46:13] <plushysceptile> That AOE is way bigger than anyone thinks
[5:46:14] <seer0ftime> floor tanking
[5:46:15] <neostria> just ate it LUL
[5:46:16] <ClarentMordred> tank that floor mihn lol
[5:46:18] <OneThousandTomatoes> I was like "what is he doing"
[5:46:21] <WolfemanMaverik> you should look up the youtube videos of each raid's set
[5:46:22] <GuyNamedGatsby> Lol drg
[5:46:24] <illusbal> i'm shouting at this stream like my dad shouts at a football game
[5:46:24] <+Tarviti> This raid just gives you character costumes from the game
[5:46:26] <Zeif00> Typical DRG
[5:46:26] <%kamenjojo> This boss fight takes forever
[5:46:32] <+xp194> @WoolieVersus I believe those two are ones you fight in the last raid
[5:46:36] <%deadbeat34> lol drg
[5:46:37] <%KetsuoTaberu> oh just like in nier
[5:46:40] <HolyGriddles> How does this play on PS4 and 5?
[5:46:42] <Agami23> but one side is not shielded
[5:46:42] <OneThousandTomatoes> the lower health does sheild
[5:46:45] <+GingerStrawhat> I actually got lucky and got the eagle egg on my first trip into the aeerie
[5:46:47] <+xp194> Oh comrades oof them at least
[5:46:47] <AllenDeadman> and you have to keep them separated or they both get buff
[5:46:49] <+Graxe_> Just like how they had a barrier in Nier
[5:46:50] <+KawaiiJetty> Only if you hit the shield part. it is a parry in the end
[5:46:51] <Alice_Lufenia> it's a great adaptation ^^
[5:46:52] <iosephe> it's rad
[5:46:53] <Louie_Salmon> That's essentially how it worked in game
[5:46:56] <%Major_Lee_> Thats a lot of RPer
[5:46:56] <Toni_Master43> @GingerStrawhat Same
[5:46:56] <ArthurDoyleRPG> Just don't hit the shield duh
[5:46:57] <DetroitSentai> directional parry(the shield) had been the game forever, so it fit well
[5:46:58] <%kamenjojo> kamenjojo subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! glad you're enjoying the last raid
[5:47:00] <vVAstrAVv> shields actually vulnerable from the front
[5:47:00] <Paranoid_Jumbotron> FF14 adapts boss fights REALLY well for an MMO
[5:47:09] <+TombstoneTTromboners> i always mess this mechanic up
[5:47:09] <MacMog> you can hit the shielded one in the front quadrant, right?
[5:47:10] <+Leftovermemes> dancers have aoes that will bounce back bad if shield isnt rotated
[5:47:12] <%deadbeat34> WELCOME TO FFXIV
[5:47:17] <dds333a> KONDZUVAI
[5:47:18] <Iwashi94> @GingerStrawhat wait that's not scripted? I got an eagle egg the moment I went to the Aerie after getting the quest lmao
[5:47:19] <olaksi> it's a really fun raid for seeing how they translate mechanics between genres
[5:47:29] <+Huderga> this part
[5:47:31] <+Dova573> behemoth in Mhw
[5:47:32] <+Graxe_> Rathalos EX
[5:47:34] <+Rafraud> Bahamut in MHW is my favorite
[5:47:35] <+teg88> The FFT raids knock it out of the park
[5:47:35] <+GingerStrawhat> Oh shit they might have changed it so that it's not so difficult maybe?
[5:47:37] <illusbal> the amount of times i have used assize wrong and got blasted
[5:47:40] <Darksword64> Fun fact, if then shielded boss is not facing inward, any AOE casts such as Assize will damage the caster :)
[5:47:40] <BluBox> That's this game all the time
[5:47:43] <+KawaiiJetty> The only thing I hate this fight is the amount of downtime
[5:47:46] <%Alazull> lol
[5:47:47] <AzureSynesthesia> woolie is gonna love this raid then lol
[5:47:48] <Applecannon63> Like Teppen
[5:47:49] <OneThousandTomatoes> thats a proximity marker
[5:47:50] <Alice_Lufenia> BODIED
[5:47:50] <%Major_Lee_> RIP them
[5:47:51] <+GingerStrawhat> I know they changed it so you can't sell weapons anymore
[5:47:52] <Agami23> ohh there goes that side of the fight
[5:47:59] <%Alazull> Those dudes who stood on the wrong side and ate that attack
[5:48:09] <AdmiralButtloaf> that shield slam is rad
[5:48:10] <%Alazull> *face palm*
[5:48:17] <%bread_assassin> Did they change the drop rates for eagle eggs? Because I casually stumbled upon like three while playing.
[5:48:18] <AdmiralButtloaf> using a shield as a weapon is cool
[5:48:22] <+teg88> They may be new to the fight
[5:48:23] <DetroitSentai> @Darksword64 Honestly they're usually tanked so far apart that that isnt a problem either way
[5:48:29] <$Holycow8498> I am glad you are enjoying this boss
[5:48:29] <+zepelinnn1> noooo people are not ´laying the raid perfecly aaaa
[5:48:31] <%Alazull> @bread_assassin Go buy a lottery ticket
[5:48:35] <PenGia> dashy dash time
[5:48:39] <+PettyFunk> @bread_assassin I think so. I had seven spawn in a row
[5:48:39] <Dragon_Batman> That must be fun to design
[5:48:40] <gunstars20> Ah teppen V
[5:48:41] <dds333a> matching mechanics to lore is great
[5:48:49] <rasseabreeze> that rescue hahahah
[5:48:51] <+KawaiiJetty> That rescue LUL
[5:48:52] <+Risingxiv> LUL
[5:48:54] <%Alazull> That's how they stood before you get Weiss
[5:48:54] <Toni_Master43> SourPls
[5:48:55] <Alice_Lufenia> didn't die tho XD
[5:48:55] <OneThousandTomatoes> was that a resue LUL
[5:48:57] <+AnActualHermitCrab> lmao
[5:48:57] <+Huderga> THE ATTEMPTED MURDER
[5:48:58] <illusbal> scruffed
[5:48:59] <%Korbinian44> beef lives
[5:48:59] <+jaggstar2020> Beef is saved
[5:49:00] <seer0ftime> LUL
[5:49:07] <+genowyn> healer trying to rescue kill beef
[5:49:08] <Darksword64> @detroitsentai I’ve run a fair few times, always make sure my DPS can get two targets in on any skills they can
[5:49:08] <OneThousandTomatoes> tried to kill a man right there
[5:49:09] <+teg88> NO
[5:49:17] <+Rafraud> Nah
[5:49:17] <Agami23> just be careful not to kill them at the same time. the game does not like that
[5:49:19] <%CodenameChaz> Fighting them equally
[5:49:23] <+TombstoneTTromboners> depends on how hard you dps
[5:49:23] <Paranoid_Jumbotron> they have their own separate health bars
[5:49:24] <+mikesapartment> the weak one switches to shield stance
[5:49:24] <Neoripo> Fightim them equally
[5:49:25] <ArthurDoyleRPG> Why would you run through that? Kappa
[5:49:27] <DetroitSentai> the shields show up in a way to keep their healths even
[5:49:29] <+Rafraud> They're just good at game
[5:49:33] <$Kekon3> Love watching the healers rescue dps
[5:49:34] <Dragon_Batman> Like in Nier they have a shield that makes them impervious so attack the other one
[5:49:40] <vVAstrAVv> they alternate shield and lance so its even
[5:49:40] <Darksword64> You can kill them at different times
[5:49:41] <+TombstoneTTromboners> now he's sad
[5:49:42] <+AnActualHermitCrab> Beef is eternal
[5:49:42] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @woolieversus If you like the conversion process like that, I will definitely keep you in mind when my fighting game-based game finishes production.
[5:49:45] <+caramelatte1> Basically one enrages if the other dies
[5:49:49] <%Alazull> DPS RACE
[5:49:52] <AzureSynesthesia> once you kill one the other starts casting "lamentation"
[5:49:53] <Paranoid_Jumbotron> LAMENTATION
[5:49:56] <Darksword64> The other just casts raid wide damage casts
[5:49:56] <OkamiDude15> killing the biggest heroes
[5:49:57] <+pissdegaulle> he's crying :(
[5:50:02] <$Holycow8498> and just like the boss fight in Nier one of them enrages if the other dies
[5:50:08] <Darksword64> Big upset boss

[5:50:49] <%cisealnine> @42nfl19 yes.
[5:50:49] <OneThousandTomatoes> ye it was cool on patch night people where like "do we have to kill them at the same time" and I was able to use nier story info to gues mechanica
[5:50:50] <Darksword64> Its a shame 24man’s are tuned for low skill, would love to get a UCoB adds phase style check on that fight
[5:50:52] <+kullumanati> Let’s go raid Pat
[5:50:53] <JanusII> Inferior FFXIV Streamer Pat.
[5:50:53] <@mothmandraws> they mean "play ff14, the hit mmo, with free trial now up to heavensward"
[5:50:54] <prime_name> "Welcome to the new world" is what is being said over the intercom, right?
[5:50:57] <+FrostedZaibatsu> hacKING
[5:50:58] <+mojopork4u> The radio chatter is just Japanese/English random stuff
[5:51:08] <rasseabreeze> its never random with yoko, man
[5:51:09] <AllenDeadman> the dorito
[5:51:12] <+bladeworksmaster> now we get to the REAL fun of this raid boys
[5:51:15] <Darksword64> @42nfl19 yes they translate from Hex to words.
[5:51:18] <+Cuon_Alpinus> worst add phase ever made
[5:51:21] <fatlystackedmac> @woolie your doing great sweetie
[5:51:29] <+mojopork4u> @prime_name I don't think so? At least with the first raid it's just talking about the factory
[5:51:32] <Dragon_Batman> This is great
[5:51:37] <Neoripo> Lali-ho!
[5:51:38] <+bladeworksmaster> also man, Mourning is a fucking TRACK for this stage
[5:51:38] <nobody287> lali-ho
[5:51:40] <snakesonabane> lali ho
[5:51:40] <+Stormzcales_Lair> did they do all three raids ?
[5:51:41] <Wallabri> lali-ho!!
[5:51:44] <+NYCrownlessKing> DO THE FIGHT
[5:51:46] <+Huderga> TOXIC
[5:51:47] <iosephe> vote dismiss
[5:51:47] <Riorii> lali-ho!
[5:51:50] <+NYCrownlessKing> Kappa
[5:51:50] <+TombstoneTTromboners> this is a trash pull
[5:51:50] <+caramelatte1> Mihn the WORST dpser
[5:51:50] <AllenDeadman> these are trash mobs
[5:51:52] <Paranoid_Jumbotron> this ad phase is actually worse if you do your AOE rotation instead of single target
[5:51:52] <%Alazull> It's just a trash fight
[5:51:55] <%CodenameChaz> It's an add rush
[5:51:55] <+Jakeofalco> deadweight
[5:51:57] <+AnActualHermitCrab> Minh is so toxic!
[5:52:01] <ArthurDoyleRPG> BibleThump
[5:52:05] <Ianrazz> @Darksword64 This content is meant to be accessible, imagine how pissed people would be if it was ultimate type difficulty.
[5:52:06] <snakesonabane> sloppeh
[5:52:21] <@mothmandraws> I wish it was orbonne tough

[5:52:31] <+KawaiiJetty> they don't get tired to use this move now lol

[5:53:02] <%CodenameChaz> Oh! Should actually advise people the next fight does have a visual strong effect that can be rough on people who suffer from Epilepsy.
[5:53:03] <VidulaSaix> It's got a slight shading on them that makes the untextured stuff look good imo
[5:53:03] <iosephe> They're good shapes!
[5:53:04] <+caramelatte1> glitching out too
[5:53:05] <%Aeogard> i clapped when i sw it!!
[5:53:06] <PhazonSuited> that is what we call "effective visual design"

[5:53:22] <OneThousandTomatoes> during the animation
[5:53:23] <+mikesapartment> use latency to move when you shouldn't be able to
[5:53:28] <Agami23> move during casting animations
[5:53:32] <bestwaifuritsu> TURN AROUND
[5:53:33] <OneThousandTomatoes> you have to stand still to cast
[5:53:34] <Iwashi94> you can move during the last half a second of a cast iirc
[5:53:34] <VidulaSaix> Slide Casting is basically moving at the last second before the spell goes off so you can get a little extra movement
[5:53:35] <ClarentMordred> you move when youre part way through the casting bar so you dont cancel out of your cast but still move
[5:53:37] <+Leftovermemes> stutter cast
[5:53:37] <Riorii> drg doesnt have a single casting bar yea
[5:53:39] <+Huderga> Make sure to open the map Minh
[5:53:43] <+bladeworksmaster> ahhhhhh here we go
[5:53:44] <rasseabreeze> here we go man
[5:53:44] <+GameFreakerZero> If you get to the last .5 secs of a cast it can't be stopped, it'll go off even if you move
[5:53:45] <Paranoid_Jumbotron> ill never be a memory...
[5:53:45] <valriot> :)
[5:53:45] <PhazonSuited> terminals showing back up
[5:53:45] <iosephe> yeah casting is frustrating

[5:54:14] <+Rafraud> What are feelings?
[5:54:16] <$Kekon3> You can move in the last 60 frames of an attack. Then start casting again and you can move and shoot
[5:54:16] <%Alazull> Well, you force them to make the right decision
[5:54:17] <Applecannon63> You mean Manna?
[5:54:18] <OneThousandTomatoes> I like summoner
[5:54:19] <WanderingSwordsman> you mentioned ikaruga earlier right?

[5:54:21] <MacMog> everything happens on the server a fraction of a second before it appears on your screen

[5:55:06] <+FrostedZaibatsu> I hate the massive girl model. Just freked my out
[5:55:06] <+Proxzo> WoW has hit animations.
[5:55:06] <Louie_Salmon> Woolie there can't be hit reaction for 24 different people
[5:55:07] <+mojopork4u> The flinch sometimes
[5:55:10] <%MisterRockett> It's an RPG Woolie you gotta think of it as an RPG.
[5:55:11] <%QuadraticGravity> Don't die before the good part, Minh :)
[5:55:14] <%CodenameChaz> Smaller enemies do shift/move from being hit but it's pretty subtle. Same with your character
[5:55:15] <+R0DA> xiv has flinch animations too
[5:55:20] <+Proxzo> Wow also now has directional hit animations.
[5:55:22] <+Graxe_> There is hit animations on enemies when they get hit
[5:55:22] <+Pixel_Matt> WoW has hit animations
[5:55:24] <Dragon_Batman> Ohh koll Red girl
[5:55:29] <Dragon_Batman> Kool*
[5:55:29] <+zepelinnn1> chat, he doesnt care about the hener, its still something he likes
[5:55:30] <VidulaSaix> Its an MMO Woolie, if everything reacted the bosses would never move because of the sheer amount of people attacking
[5:55:31] <+bladeworksmaster> Ikaruga attacks let's gooooooo
[5:55:33] <+zepelinnn1> *genre
[5:55:34] <MacMog> yeah, there’s thuds
[5:55:38] <+seoliart> Why does everyone have RP tags in the alliance LUL
[5:55:38] <afronooch> :)
[5:55:39] <BigHugs> Ikaruga time
[5:55:41] <+FrostedZaibatsu> PSO2 has it where you can feel your enemy get hit. Which is why i like it
[5:55:41] <%fetrigon> bugs the shit outta me too LUL
[5:55:43] <+AnActualHermitCrab> @QuadraticGravity I *think* you get rezzed just to do that mechanic, but I'm not sure.
[5:55:45] <prime_name> That's what turned me off from Anthem
[5:55:48] <+TombstoneTTromboners> woolie the flinch animation is replaced by big number
[5:55:50] <+Proxzo> WoW knows what direction you are swinging your weapon now too. So enemies flinch in the right direction.
[5:55:52] <SaintJehoshaphat> Woolie we know you love Ikaruga
[5:55:53] <$Kekon3> Smaller enemies, they just kinda bob their head as they get hit
[5:55:58] <OneThousandTomatoes> attacks wont go through walls of the same color
[5:56:08] <%QuadraticGravity> @AnActualHermitCrab You absolutely do not. If you're dead there, you just sit on the arena and don't get to see it.
[5:56:10] <HolyGriddles> Is Woolie not going to play?
[5:56:14] <Applecannon63> when you have the psycho girl dressed in red that is Manna
[5:56:21] <Louie_Salmon> Get in the box
[5:56:21] <+Huderga> IN JAIL AGAIN
[5:56:23] <Toni_Master43> @HolyGriddles He doesn't seem interested in playing
[5:56:33] <+AnActualHermitCrab> @QuadraticGravity Rooough. Good thing I'm an apex gamer.
[5:56:35] <Louie_Salmon> "Recreate Meteor" is the name of that move btw
[5:56:41] <$Kekon3> Woolie REALLY isn’t gonna play lmao
[5:56:44] <MacMog> Judicator boxes
[5:56:48] <OkamiDude15> @HolyGriddles woolie doesnt play mmos. so he brought in minh who does
[5:56:49] <$Kekon3> A guided experience
[5:56:51] <olaksi> I get the appeal of physics based combat, but the attack patterns are involved enough here that it's not really needed
[5:57:00] <VidulaSaix> Thats actually not true Minh. It targets the highest aggro player in the group
[5:57:02] <Louie_Salmon> "Set to tank"
[5:57:04] <+KawaiiJetty> No it will automatically go top emnity
[5:57:05] <HolyGriddles> Dang, I would love to see Woolie make a character at least. Oh well SeemsGood
[5:57:07] <PhazonSuited> i think that went onto a SMN LUL
[5:57:07] <%Korbinian44> skull really wants to take out the beef
[5:57:14] <+mojopork4u> @VidulaSaix They changed aggro recently
[5:57:14] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[5:57:15] <+QueequegTheater> Well a DRG might survive since they're a bit beefier than most other DPS
[5:57:15] <PenGia> There's a bunch of mechanics that will target depending on your job role
[5:57:19] <Alice_Lufenia> highest aggro, tho tbf that SHOULD be a dps
[5:57:20] <olaksi> assuming the tank doesn't mess up
[5:57:20] <@mothmandraws> savage stuff tends to be split mechanics on class
[5:57:20] <+Kiaayo> top emnity is always tank unless the tanks are awful
[5:57:21] <+Huderga> MY EYES
[5:57:21] <PhazonSuited> clusterfuck time
[5:57:22] <+zepelinnn1> chat, Minh is talking in friendly terms...please
[5:57:23] <wiffernubbin> and who usually has high enmity?
[5:57:24] <AzureSynesthesia> depends on the boss mechanic
[5:57:25] <%Aeogard> always the highest aggro, which is usually tanks
[5:57:26] <Neoripo> It's dependant on Agro
[5:57:27] <%KetsuoTaberu> "That would suck, because I would die."
[5:57:30] <ClarentMordred> some things will specifically targt healers or dps, but most attacks will target the person with the highest aggro which should be the tank @WoolieVersus
[5:57:32] <Agami23> theres some attacks that target casters stuff like that
[5:57:35] <PenGia> Like "this will grab both the healers and kill them unless the dps break them out of the bubble"
[5:57:38] <+pissdegaulle> mmm those df raids where the main tank dies and the other 2 dont do anything, so good
[5:57:38] <OneThousandTomatoes> if the tank is deadvthe buster goes somewhere else and they can't live through it
[5:57:41] <$Kekon3> Bosses have set attacks based on tank/healer/dps
[5:57:41] <BlueVexer> If a tank is dead during that tank buster, it will target the next person highest on agro in the party.
[5:57:41] <Darksword64> Carwash PridePog
[5:57:44] <WakeUpThrow> Tankbusters pretty much target the players the enemy wants to kill the most. It SHOULD be the tank
[5:57:48] <+the22cstomp> you cant target them though
[5:57:48] <+gespenst25> In a lot of fights yes, sometimes healers will be targeted for things.

[5:58:53] <DedlokPM> @WoolieVersus Tanks have a toggle that draw the enemies attention to them as well as taunts. Otherwise their attention is drawn to whomever is doing a lot of damage to them or the healer
[5:58:54] <+karawra> this is really cool
[5:58:57] <LordOfThePoultry> bless yoko taro!
[5:59:00] <+KawaiiJetty> and even the music change was cool
[5:59:00] <EL_TRO> 8 bit version of the song
[5:59:02] <%Aeogard> hacking! red girl! i clapped when i saw it!
[5:59:03] <%ConflagrationsGaming> is that an alliance A only mechanic?
[5:59:08] <%ConflagrationsGaming> or does every alliance go separate
[5:59:08] <olaksi> they have a lot of random little mechanics like that for transition phases
[5:59:11] <$Holycow8498> Its an everyone mechanic
[5:59:11] <HolyGriddles> Does FF14 have any other crossovers?
[5:59:11] <+MeyB_7> that is the best implimentation of the hacking mechanic
[5:59:12] <DetroitSentai> All allaince get their own
[5:59:17] <+DontMindMee> everyone does it but the alliances are split into different arenas
[5:59:17] <+the22cstomp> every alliance @ConflagrationsGaming
[5:59:22] <%ConflagrationsGaming> i ran it ONCE on release night and boy did i floor dps that one
[5:59:23] <$Thorn14> several @holygriddles
[5:59:23] <OkamiDude15> @ConflagrationsGaming pretty sure its everyone who does it
[5:59:24] <@mothmandraws> there is a monster hunter one
[5:59:25] <+Kiaayo> @HolyGriddles monster hunter and final fantasy tactics
[5:59:26] <Ashecroft> @HolyGriddles Theres a Monster Hunter dungeon
[5:59:27] <+Mendin> @HolyGriddles FFT/12, and Monster Hunter
[5:59:28] <$Holycow8498> 14 had a crossover with Garo
[5:59:29] <Darksword64> @holygriddles Mon hun, Yoaki watch, other FF games
[5:59:30] <DetroitSentai> @HolyGriddles Monster hunter
[5:59:31] <elyeuphoria> @HolyGriddles the previous 24man raid was with FF XII/Tactics
[5:59:32] <%ConflagrationsGaming> cool ! i must have. missed that one lol
[5:59:35] <Applecannon63> Oh god giant Redgirl (Manna)
[5:59:43] <olaksi> rip BLM
[5:59:43] <+QueequegTheater> In matchmaking it's random but in premade parties you choose
[5:59:48] <OneThousandTomatoes> there ff tacrics crossover too
[5:59:50] <DuwangLife> ffxv monster hunter yokai watch ffxi
[5:59:53] <+Mendin> Also technically a 5/6 boss rush crossover
[5:59:56] <MacMog> FF13, FF11
[5:59:58] <+teg88> There are 8 man raids from Stormblood that are all old FF bosses
[6:00:03] <%CodenameChaz> Yeah if you queue as part of a random party, your alliance is randomized, but you can join pre-formed parties for it
[6:00:08] <HolyGriddles> Monster Hunter crossover sounds badass...and Yokai Watch, wtf
[6:00:14] <illusbal> every time i see Fray standing in an AOE i have a heart attack
[6:00:21] <VidulaSaix> SCISSORS
[6:00:25] <PhazonSuited> i need scissors
[6:00:25] <Darksword64> Pretty much the entire game is a theme park of other FF references
[6:00:26] <OneThousandTomatoes> yokai watch was minions and mounts and weapons, not fights
[6:00:28] <+Thatghostpepper> @HolyGriddles there was an event with dragon quest FF15
[6:00:30] <MacMog> the entire game has loads of nostalgia bait from previous Final Fantasy games tho
[6:00:33] <$Kekon3> Yokai watch was just for weapons and minion buddies
[6:00:46] <Felto3> they might skip mechanics :o
[6:00:46] <%QuadraticGravity> best mechanic
[6:00:47] <+teh_rawk> there was an FF13 evenbt too
[6:00:47] <+Kiaayo> @HolyGriddles you and 7 other players fight a single rathalos and the only way you can heal is with megapotions
[6:00:48] <dds333a> Turn off the stream NOW
[6:00:48] <+FrostedZaibatsu> Like aguing on XBOX360
[6:00:48] <snakesonabane> Woolie, turn off the game console now
[6:00:51] <Applecannon63> The Watcher knows
[6:00:54] <+Das_Prints> @holygriddles Yeah you fight Rathalos and can get it as a mount where it will play the theme as you rode it. Also you could get a Poogie and Palico as pets.
[6:00:55] <rasseabreeze> they might bypass the meteors
[6:00:58] <HolyGriddles> @thatghostpepper FF and Dragon Quest crossover sounds amazing ngl
[6:01:00] <VidulaSaix> Lets see if they die LUL
[6:01:01] <+Rafraud> Like arguing on twitter
[6:01:02] <rasseabreeze> hahahah nvm
[6:01:04] <OneThousandTomatoes> ff14 was my first ff and you dont really need to know the references to get whats happening
[6:01:09] <+Maswrath> Once more Woolie demonstrates more mechanics knowledge than some people who actually play xiv
[6:01:19] <@mothmandraws> SKULL
[6:01:21] <Calamity2007> @HolyGriddles FFXIV has a minor one where you can get a blockman minion
[6:01:23] <VidulaSaix> WHAT A LOSER SKULL
[6:01:23] <PhazonSuited> 4Head
[6:01:24] <Solidnick18> LUL
[6:01:24] <MacMog> I think Greg and Omega are canonically dimension-hopping
[6:01:24] <+Tarviti> @HolyGriddles The monhun fight removes healers and tanks, everyone is a DPS and you just have to learn Rathalos like the real game
[6:01:27] <BluBox> TOXIC
[6:01:27] <+CptBritches> Lmao that pure joy from Minh
[6:01:29] <+MeyB_7> Good job on mechanic skull

[6:01:42] <+teh_rawk> god dammit ryuji

[6:01:52] <Felto3> they skipped girls + chains
[6:01:52] <%CodenameChaz> Skipped the 4 red girl part
[6:01:54] <OneThousandTomatoes> streamee privilege good dps
[6:01:54] <VidulaSaix> You did
[6:01:55] <Paranoid_Jumbotron> note how you DONT KILL THEM
[6:01:57] <MacMog> yeah, most crossovers just consist of short special event quests and fights
[6:01:59] <@mothmandraws> hi thorn
[6:02:01] <+mikesapartment> you hit her too hard
[6:02:01] <DetroitSentai> you did see them, the call was for the double meteor
[6:02:01] <PhazonSuited> 2 chests pog
[6:02:01] <+MeyB_7> Great fight *Thumbs up*
[6:02:02] <+Mendin> Did she do the chain-yank rotation AoE
[6:02:02] <Calamity2007> DPS too stronk
[6:02:03] <%Alazull> It's just a double meteor.
[6:02:04] <Agami23> theres one more where the girls get chained
[6:02:06] <BlueVexer> Holy shit, the party's DPS was nuts
[6:02:12] <Alice_Lufenia> yep, you don't kill them
[6:02:13] <+Tarviti> Show off that loot
[6:02:13] <olaksi> the last one was just a mix of 2 mechanics you already saw
[6:02:14] <+snausages_> Yeah most alliance raids are not going to have actual uptime like that lol
[6:02:14] <+KawaiiJetty> It is not exactly new, just a combination of previous mechanics
[6:02:15] <elyeuphoria> so many RP tags tho
[6:02:15] <$Thorn14> I love this raid
[6:02:16] <+xp194> Show him the casting gear
[6:02:17] <Skelegon> show thath loot
[6:02:20] <+the22cstomp> pretty much everyone in the alliance probably has full bis LUL
[6:02:21] <+TombstoneTTromboners> oh no an elevator
[6:02:21] <Calamity2007> Yeah it is a double meteor combined with those laser
[6:02:22] <+Leftovermemes> DEVOLA AND POPOLA OUTFIT
[6:02:22] <SaintJehoshaphat> Now the cool shit
[6:02:23] <+TombstoneTTromboners> say the line chat
[6:02:24] <$Kekon3> It was just remixes
[6:02:25] <+Tarviti> show that casting gear
[6:02:27] <AzureSynesthesia> the loot is references too
[6:02:30] <+TombstoneTTromboners> FOR WHOM DO YOU FIGHT
[6:02:31] <karl_rex> The healer and casting gear for this raid are Devola and Popola outfits
[6:02:31] <RamenRiderZ> They mix up the mechanics together
[6:02:33] <HolyGriddles> Alright chat, another question. How well does this play on PS4 and PS5?
[6:02:38] <+Graxe_> Item level 495 is still fairly low if people are in like 500+
[6:02:38] <2DSuperiority> black cancels black, vice versa
[6:02:39] <+Cuon_Alpinus> very well
[6:02:40] <+MeyB_7> ill be honest watching that I had no idea what was going on i would have gotten hit xD
[6:02:41] <RogueMinja> Look, the elevator.
[6:02:44] <+Leftovermemes> this is my favorite alliance raid by far
[6:02:47] <Calamity2007> What is the male loot a reference too
[6:02:49] <superbninten> you're looking at ps5 gameplay right now
[6:02:50] <iheartmota> link it
[6:02:50] <nobody287> Game plays fine on console
[6:02:51] <VidulaSaix> Devola and Popola outfits from Automata
[6:02:58] <OneThousandTomatoes> runs great on ps4 and ps5 fantastic controller support too
[6:02:59] <count_bob> It was literally made for PS4 and 5
[6:02:59] <%QuadraticGravity> The gear was devola and popola's dresses
[6:03:01] <CoffeeSlice> lol colonel sanders
[6:03:04] <+SuicidalLemmming> @HolyGriddles great on both, better on ps5 obvioulsy
[6:03:04] <EmanXLR> caster/ healer gear is popola and evola
[6:03:07] <$Holycow8498> The casting and healing sets are a reference to Devola and Popola
[6:03:09] <MacMog> plays fine on PS4, though you won’t set frame rate records
[6:03:11] <iheartmota> is on the right
[6:03:13] <+Leftovermemes> should have tried it on
[6:03:14] <+KawaiiJetty> the gear here are reference to various characters
[6:03:14] <Darksword64> @holygriddles perfectly fine on both, PS4 does have some frame dips when it gets hectic, but thats very limited situations
[6:03:14] <+Tarviti> Show the robes
[6:03:14] <+Docblargle> wrong chat log
[6:03:15] <Neoripo> Leonardo Doujinshi, what a name

[6:04:16] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1386952720297381894?s=19
[6:04:16] <Calamity2007> It's not the same name as the ones from Automata.
[6:04:17] <+KawaiiJetty> @kekon3 it is Jackass and Anemone depending on gender
[6:04:18] <+GingerStrawhat> Like 9S and A2 were fighting it concurently
[6:04:20] <+teh_rawk> both A2 and 9S fight it
[6:04:20] <Alice_Lufenia> koshi and roshi with different names
[6:04:22] <+CptBritches> When it's switching between the two of them
[6:04:25] <+Mendin> They're technically the same names but different transliterations of the philosophers' names
[6:04:26] <WolfemanMaverik> these guys are named after chinese philosophers, like characters in automata were
[6:04:27] <Dragon_Batman> This is actually the elevator
[6:04:28] <+mojopork4u> It transitions between 9s and A2 through the clouds
[6:04:29] <Vyneci> It's that section where you switch between A2 in ground combat and 9S in the flight unit
[6:04:30] <Darkdrill> that was such a fun fight
[6:04:37] <Applecannon63> KO-RO-SHI
[6:04:39] <+FrostedZaibatsu> The character switching is always the best for bosses
[6:04:42] <%0rond> these are the most canon bosses in this raid, these bosses you fight on this elevator
[6:04:44] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @zecht89
[6:04:46] <phatmac16> Such a sick fight
[6:04:47] <Calamity2007> Yeah more generic models I guess @Alice_Lufenia Probably also a reference to some chinese philosophers though
[6:04:51] <+AnActualHermitCrab> That was a really cool sequence
[6:04:51] <T_Sasquatch> The sickest shit
[6:04:56] <OneThousandTomatoes> what do these names mean?
[6:05:09] <%AmuserName> Xun-Zi and Meng-Zi are two historic Confusion philosophers with disagreements on whether man's nature was innately good or evil.
[6:05:15] <+pissdegaulle> think they're chinese philosophers
[6:05:15] <Calamity2007> Yeah this rounds counts more of a mob round
[6:05:15] <DetroitSentai> Boss fights go up to 3, other fights are 2
[6:05:19] <phatmac16> The three philosophers
[6:05:20] <OneThousandTomatoes> buster sword
[6:05:22] <wendigo172> @onethousandtomatoes famous philosophers
[6:05:22] <+GrandmasterBFunk> This fight isn't technically a boss
[6:05:22] <MacMog> the philosophers were Metal Gear Solid?
[6:05:23] <LycheeMusings> They changed it from Kongzi to Xunzi
[6:05:23] <Calamity2007> These guys are a mob round
[6:05:25] <$Holycow8498> Its a mini boss
[6:05:26] <+teh_rawk> omnislash
[6:05:27] <Alice_Lufenia> @AmuserName thank you!
[6:05:31] <dds333a> @amusername the latter, by the way
[6:05:46] <OneThousandTomatoes> they might
[6:05:49] <BlackMage66652> @Kekon3 almightyLurk
[6:05:50] <DuwangLife> the bosses in automata are named after philosophers

[6:13:28] <+Rafraud> @WoolieVersus so is it a straight arrest up there if you break curfew?
[6:13:33] <$Holycow8498> Its Kaine's theme mixed with the main theme of the Final Fantasy franchise
[6:13:34] <ReiRyghts1> oh no

[6:13:56] <+TombstoneTTromboners> there's a HINT of prequel in there
[6:13:57] <Calamity2007> @Holycow8498 Yep with a bit of The Last Song from Drakenguard thrown in
[6:13:58] <CoffeeSlice> aw man

[6:14:22] <VidulaSaix> THE FINAL SONG
[6:14:22] <+snausages_> Just think of how much Nier's cachet has increased that they are putting the main FF theme in a remix for Kaine's theme, it's sort of insane
[6:14:23] <+Finaldragoon> here it comes
[6:14:24] <RogueMinja> Oops all Drakengard.
[6:14:25] <snakesonabane> FINAL SONG

[6:14:30] <JanusII> It's why they use the song that's the beginning of FF crossing the bridge.
[6:14:33] <Calamity2007> @amused_platypus Kinda, the flowers in the hair kind of confirms it too

[6:14:55] <VidulaSaix> That thread Minh mentioned does a good job of explaining stuff @WoolieVersus
[6:14:55] <OkamiDude15> its cool shut up
[6:14:55] <%ShinobiPhoenix> code: BUYING NieR Replicant will decide if we get an Drakengard remake
[6:14:56] <Calek> it's both
[6:14:57] <phatmac16> Don’t worry about it
[6:14:59] <seer0ftime> the reason is no shut up tho

[6:15:05] <+Saunt> Does he know about the week letters we are getting atm, with not much atm but maybe more
[6:15:05] <+Dwarven_Gaming> the latter
[6:15:06] <snakesonabane> BibleThump
[6:15:07] <Tracazoid> It's Yoko Taro, it's probably both
[6:15:07] <+NYCrownlessKing> it's Okabe, he works on all the raid music
[6:15:07] <+Maswrath> The “birth” of the taro verse
[6:15:08] <+SeroSedLaeto> Complex questions with complex answers
[6:15:10] <Robot_Nixon_> little column A, little column B

[6:15:58] <wiffernubbin> sleep over
[6:16:01] <DetroitSentai> doesnt curfew allow you do be out because of work?
[6:16:02] <$Holycow8498> IT isn't just Okabe its also Uematsu since this is using the main theme of the final fantasy franchise
[6:16:03] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @shieldecho

[6:16:30] <VidulaSaix> @Aeogard So, factory*
[6:16:34] <+NYCrownlessKing> no we arent saying who composed each song used in the remix. we mean Okabe is taking the music and making the mix @Holycow8498

[6:16:48] <+TheotherKristian> Fight may be done in a bit, but what about everything else related after...
[6:16:51] <$Holycow8498> Did they actually get Okabe to compose for the Nier raids?
[6:16:52] <+fugatlas> Woolie VS Montreal PD
[6:16:53] <%fetrigon> LUL
[6:16:54] <OneThousandTomatoes> angelic
[6:16:54] <+Rafraud> Do you get a fine or something if you break curfew?
[6:16:57] <+Krivvan> @Holycow8498 yes
[6:16:57] <+TombstoneTTromboners> the angelic language
[6:16:58] <OkamiDude15> god the fucking bells. woolieMIRIN
[6:17:01] <%Aeogard> @VidulaSaix I mean, I suppose, but I still think it introduced more new stuff for both fans and newcomers to enjoy. plus had some great sets that are still my fave from the 3
[6:17:02] <%0rond> it's angelic
[6:17:03] <%QuadraticGravity> There's a lot of post cutscene
[6:17:04] <heartlesshealer> yeah, you heard drakengard 1 bells =)
[6:17:06] <%fetrigon> angelic script
[6:17:07] <+Rafraud> angelic
[6:17:13] <%ShinobiPhoenix> but Taro legit cares about details and continuity
[6:17:13] <dds333a> angelic script, it was around earlier
[6:17:14] <Neoripo> Angelic language from Drakengard
[6:17:15] <%fetrigon> or something like that
[6:17:17] <+xp194> PTSD Bells
[6:17:20] <VidulaSaix> @Aeogard Aesthetically it's fien but narratively it's an absolute mess
[6:17:22] <duchessdynamic> I understand you can translate them for easter eggs

[6:19:22] <VidulaSaix> What time is curfew cause if it's at 8 you may as well stop immediately after this ends @WoolieVersus
[6:19:24] <zecht89> Basically, the Queen managed to digitize itself, like how Caim and Angelus introduced magic to our world, I believe 9S in turn introduced technology into Drakengard's World with the rocket, making the worlds loop in a way. this also means the Queen can merge with itself like this one being presented as 2 women
