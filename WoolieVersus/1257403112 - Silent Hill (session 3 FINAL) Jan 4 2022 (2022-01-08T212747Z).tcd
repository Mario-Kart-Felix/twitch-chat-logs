[0:02:42] <fuji_n2> p4U - wait for modders to fix it edition
[0:02:44] <@Menitta> im always excited for Ultimax
[0:02:46] <%hereiam407> Good movement
[0:02:49] <qonfiguration> It's not off the table

[0:03:54] <%holydeviant1> one of these days...
[0:04:11] <+Jiggisnipe> @DatAsuna El Shaddai
[0:04:14] <%baka_sugoi> Da B I B L E
[0:04:15] <fuji_n2> no idea
[0:04:21] <+DatAsuna> oh, that was a fun one and done
[0:04:23] <ranarath> El Shaddai got a SMT-like sequel called The Lost Child.
[0:04:28] <Arqartur0> Wait... REGGIE SHAVED!?
[0:04:29] <qonfiguration> it goes into some bibble, but ANIME
[0:04:31] <%baka_sugoi> Book of Jebus
[0:04:35] <+DatAsuna> I like it, it's mostly just book of enoch stuff
[0:04:38] <Dio_TR> REGGIE SHAVED!?!?!?!?
[0:04:39] <Ziegsy> I played it YEARS ago when it came out
[0:04:40] <%RyTYoung> EVERYONE HERE
[0:04:44] <%ekodrop> el shaddai is just a meme
[0:04:45] <%RyTYoung> WE CARE
[0:04:47] <+DatAsuna> It's like furi before furi basically
[0:04:50] <+skyshinecrusader> Its closer to smt idea of bible
[0:04:53] <@Menitta> Lmao the idea of recommending a game and going "idk I never played it" LUL
[0:04:56] <Lewisisphat> el shaddai fuckin rules
[0:04:58] <+solzan2000> El Shaddai, trippy game
[0:05:01] <Lewisisphat> essential ps3core
[0:05:02] <+DatAsuna> If you just title it woolievs god that would be half the views alone lol
[0:05:05] <Arqartur0> I mean, Halo is Bibbl games
[0:05:08] <%livlinn> I do want some El Shaddai
[0:05:17] <SlangPunk> Oh damn, looking clean Reggie
[0:05:21] <%Th3SmartAlec> @menitta same energy as a lot of 'informed people' online LUL
[0:05:28] <peachy996> Day of the Tentacle sounds like a cool Japanese Holiday
[0:05:33] <qonfiguration> SH2 and 3 got a literal puzzle difficulty option
[0:05:35] <%Dapper_Cactuar> Sam and Max Hit the Road is also a good one
[0:05:40] <Wofoeh> WHERE DID THE BEARD GO D:
[0:05:41] <qonfiguration> it gets rough
[0:05:43] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @woolieversus reggie got the reggarth goatee
[0:05:43] <%livlinn> It has one of the sexiest Lucifer so yeah??? shiaYum
[0:05:48] <@Menitta> oh god i was thinking ape escape
[0:05:51] <Arqartur0> I miss Donkey Kong Country
[0:05:52] <Ziegsy> Stroke the cat THEN ring the bell
[0:05:59] <%Shad0wTag> Shad0wTag subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 2 month streak! Yo fellas, happy new year! Gotta keep supporting my favourite content creator of the last 10 or so years! With STM5 are there any other SMT games you are gonna play? I just finished Journey Redux for the 3DS via emulation and its dope.
[0:06:02] <+projectmanatees> sam and max is really good
[0:06:13] <+Burritosavm13> Did they already play SH?
[0:06:13] <ianabstract> The old adventure games made more money on strategy guides than games sales, so they leaned into that
[0:06:14] <%hereiam407> Leisure Suit Larry
[0:06:19] <qonfiguration> I remember a puzzle in gabriel knight that required making a makeshift fake mustache to impersonate some guy that doesn't even have one
[0:06:19] <%Th3SmartAlec> Hammer Space baby
[0:06:19] <AngryAsian5> Pixel Hunt and brute-force
[0:06:20] <miucsa51> Throw a pie to the yeti kinda logic for those games
[0:06:27] <+Breaknoon> use the frying pan on the spark plug in the hidden car for the real ending
[0:06:28] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @burritosavm13 streams start at 1
[0:06:38] <Wofoeh> @WoolieVersus I have no mouth, "Let me put my evil mother in law inside my pocket, why not"
[0:06:38] <+Burritosavm13> Ah ok thanks
[0:06:40] <%dds333a> @qonfiguration which literally wasnt even necessary
[0:06:46] <andre11dr> This reminds me of the I have No Mouth game where the dude puts his wife in his pocket
[0:06:47] <%dds333a> The most insane puzzle
[0:06:50] <%holydeviant1> The hard mode puzzles in 2 and 3 are fucking nuts, tho
[0:07:00] <+Bitscreed> Few puzzles beat the insanity of getting the fake moustache in...I think it was Gabriel Knight 3, that required getting cat fur with sticky tape.
[0:07:00] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1478257606875815940?t=yjLm7ZYgulpaxSOSAEFNpA&s=19
[0:07:13] <miucsa51> Sierra games were notorious for that
[0:07:14] <qonfiguration> Combinatorial logic is death
[0:07:19] <+Bitscreed> But with a whole bunch of other random nonsense between getting the sticky tape and finding the cat
[0:07:24] <cartakus> Because that was the game and nothing else
[0:07:26] <qonfiguration> USE AXE ON TREE
[0:07:27] <vavilonica> Silent Hill 3 Hard mode puzzles can destroy human minds
[0:07:28] <drunken_lemur> Indie?
[0:07:29] <%dds333a> he was also impersonating a dude who didn't even HAVE a mustache LUL
[0:07:30] <Arqartur0> How would you approach an Aggretsuko game, without making it an NFT/Microtransaction trash game?
[0:07:37] <SlangPunk> @holydeviant1 Isn't there some really obscure poetry reference in 2 that still looks like nonsense without context? lol
[0:07:51] <Zebroneath> I Have No Mouth
[0:07:54] <%Gasgrave> Reggie lookin clean today!
[0:08:03] <%holydeviant1> @SlangPunk It involved Shakespeare and whatnot in a library
[0:08:07] <qonfiguration> A significant amount of point and click games had a completely useless LICK command
[0:08:11] <MyNameIsRasus> Reggie lookin damn handsome
[0:08:12] <SlangPunk> @arqartur0 Make it like P4 dancing
[0:08:17] <+Breaknoon> Full Throttle was tight
[0:08:19] <brunoberserk> wait , REGGIE SHAVED ???
[0:08:26] <Arqartur0> @SlangPunk I can see it
[0:08:28] <fuji_n2> other smt5?
[0:08:28] <@Menitta> Ace Attorney streamlined some stuff but idk if that's considered point and click
[0:08:34] <%dds333a> Smt v's LUL
[0:08:37] <qonfiguration> I wish SJ was on PC
[0:08:38] <+DatAsuna> No the switch version
[0:08:38] <%itstreylar> Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People was ironically way too simple when it would have been fitting to be way more obscure
[0:08:38] <Dakuu75> RiP Reggie's beard... it will be missed.
[0:08:39] <LordOfThePoultry> YEYEYEYEYE
[0:08:40] <%dds333a> plural
[0:08:43] <MyNameIsRasus> that's a good one
[0:08:47] <Ardailec> World of Stronk
[0:08:47] <depressioncherrie> Devil Survivor 1+2 are the most underrated in the series
[0:08:50] <%dds333a> no
[0:08:51] <%livlinn> shiaHypers
[0:08:54] <MyNameIsRasus> no
[0:08:58] <@Menitta> Jack Bros on the Virtual Boy
[0:08:59] <fuji_n2> digital devil saga
[0:08:59] <%dds333a> Jack bros Kappa Kappa Kappa
[0:09:00] <+ZealStar> nocturne FUCKS
[0:09:00] <qonfiguration> It was made for the international market
[0:09:01] <%ThePich> no
[0:09:01] <zedravan> dante too
[0:09:02] <+DatAsuna> No but it's the first "mainstream" one
[0:09:02] <+D4C_Trice> Featuring Dante from Devil may cry
[0:09:04] <+solzan2000> DDS is good too
[0:09:05] <RedBlossomail> jack bros tho Kappa
[0:09:05] <SlangPunk> @holydeviant1 Gotcha, I must of assumed it wasn't Shakespeare
[0:09:11] <%dds333a> yes. mainline
[0:09:11] <+projectmanatees> jack bros is mainline Kappa
[0:09:15] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[0:09:16] <%Shad0wTag> Yeah I believe mainline that is right
[0:09:16] <andre11dr> Journey is a great one BUT it's also complicated and jank
[0:09:16] <+Breaknoon> yes
[0:09:18] <MyNameIsRasus> mainline correct
[0:09:18] <@Menitta> LUL
[0:09:22] <%ThePich> Jack Bros is the only canon game
[0:09:28] <CrimsonGargoyle> Reggie with that DRIP
[0:09:36] <%Reverend_Roscoe> SMT? The Persona spinoff?
[0:09:38] <fuji_n2> Jack bros is mainline tho
[0:09:38] <MyNameIsRasus> Reggie vs Nocturne
[0:09:41] <%Th3SmartAlec> Time for short black hair?
[0:09:42] <+Undenizen> yoooo
[0:09:43] <+gpallas> Mood
[0:09:44] <%ThePich> Play Stange Journey and become a True Man
[0:09:44] <%jepupu> jepupu subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months! 
[0:09:45] <+DatAsuna> there is nocturne references in the  raidou comp
[0:09:49] <%Th3SmartAlec> 7 years old?
[0:09:51] <+DatAsuna> jack bros is the most important
[0:09:53] <qonfiguration> Harry's so handsome they had to nerf him in SM
[0:09:53] <Enn19> We'll be able to be graced with MOTHMAN
[0:09:56] <+D4C_Trice> is this the first SH stream?
[0:09:59] <%dds333a> Devil Survivor is also fantastic
[0:10:01] <MyNameIsRasus> Demi Kids is the most important
[0:10:03] <%Th3SmartAlec> @d4c_trice 3rd
[0:10:03] <qonfiguration> third SH stream
[0:10:04] <+Breaknoon> hidden options by pressing L1/R1

[0:10:06] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @d4c_trice 3rd
[0:10:08] <miucsa51> time for silent hill
[0:10:08] <fuji_n2> @d4c_trice mo
[0:10:13] <@Menitta> the first SMT related anything to grace the west was Jack Bros on Virtual Boy
[0:10:15] <%Shad0wTag> @andre11dr I played with a guide for my sanity lol
[0:10:18] <+D4C_Trice> ah beans I'm late to the party
[0:10:22] <qonfiguration> He's not shirtless, it's just a wide collar. He's ripped
[0:10:25] <+Bitscreed> @DatAsuna Because he's a DILF
[0:10:25] <%dds333a> @enn19 dirty catchprase thief
[0:10:26] <%Th3SmartAlec> @datasuna ...dad energy?
[0:10:27] <@Menitta> Even back then Atlus was just so smart LUL
[0:10:29] <MyNameIsRasus> @D4C_Trice just begun
[0:10:30] <+Breaknoon> extra options by pressing L1/R1
[0:10:35] <peachy996> Now Woolie Remember: ABS
[0:10:36] <Enn19> @andre11dr I wish I played with a guide LUL
[0:10:36] <+Undenizen> I nearly died from misadventure at work yesterday. My plan was to be productive today but I think instead I'm gonna veg out over here.
[0:10:37] <heart_ablaze> @d4c_trice they just started don't worry
[0:10:39] <%dds333a> Harry is a chad
[0:10:42] <+DatAsuna> He is indeed a very handsome man
[0:10:43] <%livlinn> shiaSnack
[0:10:43] <qonfiguration> oh yeah, you can change the blood color... for some reason
[0:10:46] <%oneimportantthing> Mason is such a cool surname
[0:10:48] <andre11dr> Friendly reminder that SMT 4 is still shackled to the 3DS
[0:10:48] <Enn19> @dds333a What did I do? D:
[0:10:58] <SlangPunk> Gonna duck for spoilers sake, have a good stream Woolz
[0:10:59] <+Breaknoon> you can switch the run control so you dont have to hold the run button
[0:11:10] <heart_ablaze> @qonfiguration i assume for people who aren't good with gore
[0:11:15] <%Shad0wTag> @andre11dr And so is Apocalypse
[0:11:19] <+D4C_Trice> I mean I'm watching part 3 before part 1 and 2
[0:11:20] <Ziegsy> Spin Witch!
[0:11:20] <peachy996> And her big Tie
[0:11:23] <+ReallyBigRocks> gyromanced all over
[0:11:27] <fuji_n2> as foretold
[0:11:27] <%Th3SmartAlec> Cybil still with no gun LUL
[0:11:30] <cartakus> Gyromancy
[0:11:33] <%AngryHomunculus> You mean donner kebab?
[0:11:35] <qonfiguration> That tie's the real black magic
[0:11:36] <eolen> gyromancy
[0:11:37] <%itstreylar> Yerromancy
[0:11:38] <Dakuu75> how come woolie still has to do sync tests? I thought technology evolved past that all ready
[0:11:41] <Fuji808> Gyromancylady is my least favorite pro wrestler of the 90s
[0:11:42] <majindusto> GETTING  DIZZY ON GYROMANCY
[0:11:42] <andre11dr> Harry should buy a boat
[0:11:44] <Davimotion96> speen
[0:11:46] <miucsa51> Gyromancy
[0:12:00] <%livlinn> Did you get your gyros last time?
[0:12:01] <BlackermanZX> San D.
[0:12:02] <Fuji808> Sandford Kdelly
[0:12:03] <miucsa51> speeeeeeen
[0:12:03] <turkidre> show us your items
[0:12:06] <peachy996> Hammer is your V1
[0:12:09] <+StooEsq> Dahlia with her Gyromancy and Ska necktie
[0:12:11] <dukenux> HAMMA
[0:12:19] <%Th3SmartAlec> Because Woolie ain't familiar with the axe lore Kappa
[0:12:19] <Fuji808> Sanford Kelly would have a bad time in Silent Hill
[0:12:21] <%oneimportantthing> No wonder Kojima wanted to do SH - Gyromancy is basically nanomachines
[0:12:22] <cartakus> wow that is a actual warhammer wtf?
[0:12:23] <+PunishedBuck> Mystery Goo
[0:12:28] <%dds333a> @enn19 Mothman steals "hee ho" in SJ due to a translation error, I'm just referring to that LUL
[0:12:34] <peachy996> Hammer is the Main, Axe is the experiment for now
[0:12:40] <cartakus> And knoif
[0:12:44] <Arqartur0> @cartakus ...40k?
[0:12:45] <Enn19> @dds333a Wait REALLY? I NEVER KNEW THAT
[0:12:51] <+Breaknoon> You can access hidden options by pressing the shoulder buttons on the options menu.
[0:12:55] <%livlinn> wooliePOYO
[0:13:03] <turkidre> go to the lighthouse and use that item you got from early game
[0:13:03] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @peachy996 the axeperiment?
[0:13:05] <%Th3SmartAlec> No lab time for axe smh
[0:13:17] <cartakus> Nah just medieval weapon
[0:13:17] <+PunishedBuck> Hammer Da Bes
[0:13:19] <Arqartur0> Simple Weapon vs Martial Weapon proficency
[0:13:21] <hdroark134> axe is sad
[0:13:24] <%dds333a> @d4c_trice yeah sure Kappa
[0:13:24] <qonfiguration> I think the axe's just better knife
[0:13:27] <andre11dr> I think when Woolie beats the game we should probably explain to him that all of Dahlias dialogue is misstranslated nonsense
[0:13:29] <+Undenizen> that's not a hammer, that's a fucking lucerne
[0:13:30] <+rasend0ri> Let‚Äôs goooooooo
[0:13:33] <Dakuu75> "high" is more than "moderate" right?
[0:13:36] <majindusto> NO LAB FOR AXE :(
[0:13:41] <brunoberserk> Harry '' the hammer '' Mason
[0:13:55] <+PunishedBuck> Mjolnir
[0:13:57] <Fuji808> @WoolieVersus Check to see if you have hidden options unlocked. Go to the options menu and use the shoulder buttons.
[0:13:58] <%ChoculaUltra> crap I missed the opening bit - did they talk about Justin Wong getting parried again 18 years later

[0:14:16] <BlackermanZX> its fine dont worry
[0:14:19] <Arqartur0> Ready to Not be Scared is not the motto Survival Horror games.

[0:14:45] <+Undenizen> @Arqartur0 but... what if you got scared anyway?
[0:14:46] <Treasure_Vault> I think those ratings don't matter except for a New Game + thing.
[0:14:51] <%livlinn> OhMyDog NotLikeThis
[0:14:52] <andre11dr> There's a lot wierd naming stuff in this game, like they keep saying Samael but the demon is clearly supposed to be Baphomet
[0:14:56] <%ChoculaUltra> @Reverend_Roscoe check out Justin Wong's twitter. 4 days into the year and he caught the full Daigo parry w/ punish during a game against capge lmfao

[0:15:19] <%dds333a> @rytyoung unironically correct.
[0:15:21] <Treasure_Vault> Like, the rating on your last runthrough determines the power of a newgame + superweapon, but that doesn't matter for you.
[0:15:25] <+gpallas> @ChoculaUltra That was amazing xD
[0:15:27] <peachy996> Ahh nice and foreboding
[0:15:32] <+Undenizen> is this an emulator or...?

[0:17:37] <+pacmanswang> pacmanswang subscribed with Prime. 
[0:17:41] <+Undenizen> wasn't there a thing about how the weird texture warping on the original PS1 is actually really hard to emulate?
[0:17:48] <Arqartur0> only my*
[0:17:49] <emMmDeeKay> @gpallas thanks dood
[0:18:04] <andre11dr> I love how no matter the game, Woolie will always try to play melee LUL
[0:18:09] <%Indigo_Automaton> Life Preserver
[0:18:23] <%Indigo_Automaton> I think that's what they're called anyway
[0:18:26] <Naho_Saenoki> A fun fact that I love about Silent Hill 2 is that if you play the game without a memory card, all of the New Game+ items are just available from the start. I think one of the devs went on record as saying that he didn't want any player to be locked out of content.
[0:18:31] <Dame_90> Huzzah
[0:18:43] <+Undenizen> @andre11dr you HAVE played a survival horror before, right? bullets are precious life blood

[0:21:13] <Treasure_Vault> there is no shame in trying again good
[0:21:15] <%itstreylar> instead of 2 kits and 2 bottles
[0:21:21] <+Undenizen> @zedravan nono, i mean the opposite of that. fixing them is easy, but if you WANT the warping like how it was on the actual console, that's hard to replicate
[0:21:25] <majindusto> Woolie  speaking  like a COWARD
[0:21:29] <%MyNameIsRasus> woolie is a hardcore videogamer

[0:28:54] <ragasquid> okay cool lol
[0:28:59] <+gpallas> I mean, he could be refering to Dahlia, Cybil herself or Alessa

[0:29:08] <peachy996> I thought Kaufmann
[0:29:18] <qonfiguration> If a woman can be called a creep, Dahlia's definitely that woman
[0:29:21] <%dds333a> Yamaoka going off again
[0:29:23] <+gpallas> I thought Kaufmann wouldn't even be on his mind xD
[0:29:30] <+Undenizen> look man. this game was revolutionary for 1999.

[0:35:28] <+gpallas> @Razeino I don't think they have any parameter of what 'is' low ammo
[0:35:30] <%WaitHowDidIGetHere> @dame_90 So "Mass Effect" is canonically set in the Otherworld?
[0:35:34] <Onorekian> unless it's literally free
[0:35:40] <%livlinn> Ew
[0:35:41] <+0neReeler> ok that effect is the music..?
[0:35:43] <qonfiguration> not even bait
[0:35:54] <%Fnir> the FEAR

[1:16:40] <Narratorway> I'm going by order of numbers and first letter, cause that's how those things tend to go.  I actually don't know if that's the answer.

[1:18:16] <+Pleblu> 4th month
[1:18:16] <Treasure_Vault> Swear the background music sounded like apache for a minute
[1:18:19] <projectcapsule> centaurman
[1:18:27] <amiavamp> This is Devilpunk, it's like Steampunk but it runs on rust and blood
[1:18:34] <cartakus> Saint seya really is not big up there huh?
[1:18:34] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> has Sadge-attarius become a thing anywhere?
[1:18:39] <projectcapsule> kage bunshin
[1:18:40] <+Breaknoon> dont focus on the zodiac element
[1:18:49] <majindusto> ARE YOU?
[1:18:50] <Narratorway> Here's the hint: The answer does NOT have to do with the sign's meaning.
[1:18:53] <vavilonica> this is my favorite puzzle ever
[1:18:55] <wqorst> what about the tail tho
[1:18:56] <$eriksdrums> We're missing Fallopian
[1:19:07] <%dds333a> @cartakus it sure is down here in DR LUL
[1:19:11] <%Indigo_Automaton> @amiavamp Does that make SH2 Trauma-Punk?
[1:19:12] <%ThePich> if you like Silent Hill OST i reccomend the bands Coil and Nurse With Wound
[1:19:16] <+SlappyMeats> this puzzle is such a great swerve after a game fuill of puzzles that require in-depth analysis
[1:19:19] <Chatterbox1991> this is the exact reaction DarksydePhil had to this same puzzle
[1:19:21] <projectcapsule> sh2 is industrial horror
[1:19:21] <ry4n_c00per> i love this game but this puzzle is just obnoxious lmaoo
[1:19:26] <projectcapsule> sh1 i mean
[1:19:32] <Treasure_Vault> There's absolutely a bit in this song that sounds like Apache from the Sugarhill Gang.
[1:19:33] <+gpallas> It doesn't seem like it
[1:19:39] <+Breaknoon> the actually changed this puzzle really late in development to make it simpler. in the pre release issue of PSM it had the answer for the original scrapped puzzle
[1:19:45] <Onorekian> oh shit DSP has been name-dropped, you know the LP's getting somewhere when that happens
[1:19:47] <Dakuu75> aaahh~ the safety of a puzzle room
[1:19:49] <+Fefe41> Ok but what about Serpentarius tho
[1:19:54] <artoflec> jump on it, jump on it üéµ
[1:19:56] <peachy996> SH2 is Guilt Punk
[1:19:59] <+gpallas> Cause Pisces is 0 and Libra is 2
[1:20:02] <%dds333a> @onorekian the immortal
[1:20:05] <%RemedyofRevenge> libra is the omega looking one
[1:20:13] <peachy996> SH3 is trauma punk
[1:20:16] <projectcapsule> libra is the crab
[1:20:21] <%dds333a> woolieCRAB
[1:20:21] <majindusto> I dond believe  this has anything  to do with actual  horoscopes
[1:20:31] <majindusto> *don't
[1:20:32] <AppleBerryKitty> what is this music?!!?!
[1:20:35] <+Breaknoon> it doesnt
[1:20:39] <Narratorway> Yeah, the Zodiac part is irrelevant.  It's actually MUCH simpler.
[1:20:47] <%dds333a> @appleberrykitty yamaoka collab Kappa
[1:20:47] <qonfiguration> SH2 is decay punk
[1:20:56] <%JetpackMcQuack> playing the bowls
[1:20:56] <El_Rabbit> Homecoming is Trash Punk
[1:20:57] <Dotados> caprica
[1:21:03] <+gpallas> Yeah
[1:21:05] <+vaderxyz1970> Is this the definition of seeing the forest for the trees
[1:21:05] <majindusto> Woolie  thinking  TOO HARD
[1:21:05] <+Breaknoon> the solution is a real forehead slapper
[1:21:08] <+Bitscreed> I absolutely cannot remember how I solved this puzzle when I was younger, but I blundered through it eventually. Sod knows how.
[1:21:09] <Slim_Lipid> No that's brungleco
[1:21:11] <AppleBerryKitty> I gotta MMMMMM
[1:21:18] <Kriss1827> speaking of the 12 signs anyone else here love Saint Seiya?
[1:21:19] <qonfiguration> ... oh shit I just got it that's so fucking evil
[1:21:21] <cartakus> Homecoming is so shit
[1:21:28] <%MightyDuckShoes> is ares a zodiac sign?
[1:21:31] <$eriksdrums> Does Japan use Zodiac signs?
[1:21:33] <%JetpackMcQuack> A capricorn would be done by now
[1:21:34] <KaiserMario> Easiest puzzle ever
[1:21:36] <Onorekian> pretty sure the game is not expecting you to know latin
[1:21:37] <konarius> he figured it out and now going through a process of elemination that won't end for hours
[1:21:43] <majindusto> You have all the clues
[1:21:44] <Narratorway> "WHAT DO THE NUMBERS MEAN MASON!"
[1:21:45] <%dds333a> @eriksdrums no, blood type Kappa
[1:21:47] <metoren> @Kriss1827 Grew up with it. Great 80's stuff
[1:21:48] <%Shad0wTag> @Bitscreed Thank Gyromancy
[1:21:49] <%MyNameIsRasus> @Kriss1827 that depends how many people from latam are there in this chat
[1:21:52] <qonfiguration> unlike SH3, which would expect you to know
[1:21:52] <projectcapsule> these cults are a buncha nerds
[1:21:57] <$eriksdrums> @dds333a Ahaha, right
[1:22:00] <wqorst> anti woolie puzzle
[1:22:01] <+Bitscreed> @Bitscreed You're right, and I will. Thanks Gyromancy
[1:22:02] <+Pleblu> Yeah the numbers are off so not sure
[1:22:24] <Narratorway> Oh!  I was right.
[1:22:29] <Kriss1827> @metoren was born in 99 but grew up watching thanks to reruns in mexico
[1:22:33] <+gpallas> @Kriss1827 Haven't seen any of the new stuff, but yeah
[1:22:34] <dukenux> in order of age, so it outright tells you
[1:22:40] <+Fefe41> @Kriss1827 I loved it as a kid but rereading it as an adult it wasn't as good
[1:22:44] <majindusto> AGE
[1:22:46] <Enn19> They are not related
[1:22:49] <+Breaknoon> separate!
[1:22:54] <hkaras> separate
[1:23:02] <majindusto> Separate
[1:23:03] <+gpallas> Seems like it
[1:23:12] <metoren> @Kriss1827 true. Knowing the order of the zodiac is second nature to us by now hehe
[1:23:14] <zedravan> you got not birth dates so i don't think so
[1:23:19] <amiavamp> basically playing Riven now
[1:23:24] <+Breaknoon> the numbers on the list are the person's age
[1:23:35] <%JetpackMcQuack> kinamaHmm
[1:23:36] <projectcapsule> the list are on the number's person
[1:23:47] <cartakus> I don't know why but saint seya re-uses story beats every single ark.
[1:24:13] <projectcapsule> boss waiting for harry to get the puzzle
[1:24:26] <%notsoy> lol it spells a word when sorted by age
[1:24:26] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:24:26] <+gpallas> @cartakus It's easier than coming up with new stuff :/
[1:24:29] <Narratorway> alert
[1:24:46] <+Fefe41> Every Seiya fight was him spamming meteor fist until it worked
[1:24:51] <DrkJP520> I just got here, and are they really moving that slow? cuz this seems like a lot of backseating
[1:24:56] <cartakus> Yeah...but like every ark?
[1:24:58] <+gpallas> Maybe just the first letters or initials?

[1:27:53] <amiavamp> @zedravan I bet it wasn't, to make it harder, just like the puzzle in Deadly Premonition that assumes Japanese people don't know chess
[1:27:55] <$RunningNGunning> ayyy

[1:28:24] <cartakus> That shit was made to confuse
[1:28:37] <%dds333a> WoolieWoolz: Puzzle Critic
[1:28:38] <@Menitta> The first letters should've been bold
[1:28:43] <qonfiguration> remember, they changed the puzzle and the preview had a way harder version
[1:28:45] <+Bitscreed> It's obtuse, but not as obtuse as some other puzzles for the era.
[1:28:49] <+Fefe41> It feels like a not-so-well-thought-out escape room puzzle
[1:28:49] <projectcapsule> was poetic to fuck with players
[1:28:53] <Dakuu75> @Menitta yeah
[1:28:58] <+SlappyMeats> nah man, you got there
[1:29:02] <%dds333a> LUL

[1:29:23] <Grim1952> You gotta asume the dev is not an asshole
[1:29:25] <+Jiggisnipe> Woolie assumed first letters because typing out full names was too much
[1:29:26] <qonfiguration> bad vibes

[1:29:38] <Onorekian> dont feel like it right now
[1:29:41] <DSD24> Man everyones dying to be here

[1:30:48] <Onorekian> LUL
[1:30:50] <konarius> yea, Alessa pretty much tried every magic thing she read about
[1:30:50] <El_Rabbit> Dave's Star

[1:31:04] <+xenoboost> sadness
[1:31:04] <%MyNameIsRasus> Solomon is David's dad
[1:31:04] <DSD24> Solomon had a cool Cat Eared Wife in Fate
[1:31:06] <miucsa51> the lower key of solomon LUL
[1:31:07] <Slim_Lipid> It is the predecessor to the Star of David, which became the symbol of the Jewish people in modern times.
[1:31:08] <%CappuccinoGuil> @dukenux you know what, fair fucking point LUL
[1:31:09] <%hereiam407> Oh no
[1:31:10] <+xenoboost> BibleThump BibleThump
[1:31:11] <lotharrio> Solomon was a huge wizard that summoned demons and maybe had a laser gun. I'm only 5% being stupid.

[1:31:15] <Proeaten> The cult in silent hill explicitly takes a bunch of shit from different religions and repurposes it for its own
[1:31:15] <+Breaknoon> King Solomon was a "magician"
[1:31:15] <cartakus> Find a stick to make a magick staff
[1:31:18] <andre11dr> Woolie, this game thinks Samael is Baphomet, don't ask to much accuracy

[2:00:31] <NireFuster> Did Woolie meet with Cybil again? I came here after the last vod so I missed stuff
[2:00:45] <Treasure_Vault> @NireFuster yep
[2:00:48] <Overloard> scmoovement
[2:00:50] <%Shad0wTag> @NireFuster Yep and she got cured
[2:00:53] <%MyNameIsRasus> maybe bigger range?
[2:00:59] <Narratorway> Could have sworn the rifle was the more powerful weapon.
[2:01:09] <jett_eyes> oh, is this the end of the game?
[2:01:10] <%dds333a> LUL
[2:01:11] <DSD24> Bonk
[2:01:18] <NireFuster> @shad0wtag Oh my god I was hoping he'd do it, that's incredible. first playthrough and he already got a lot of cool stuff!
[2:01:20] <%dds333a> @jett_eyes getting there
[2:01:21] <%MightyDuckShoes> Footsies
[2:01:24] <+gpallas> Woolie with them footsies
[2:01:25] <jetstreamlove_R> Best to save up ammo for bosses so use it use them only in emergencies
[2:01:26] <TheButtravage> @Narratorway Shotgun is generally strongest point blank but rifle gives you a lot of range with no drop off on damage.
[2:01:37] <amiavamp> sometimes you just gotta walk your shotgun
[2:01:38] <majindusto> No Axe :(
[2:01:41] <%hereiam407> Blam
[2:01:46] <qonfiguration> Woolie's had some impeccable tech the whole run
[2:01:50] <0cash> my friend andy used to do that at school
[2:02:14] <%Shad0wTag> @NireFuster It was very touch and go but Woolie very much did not want to shoot her. We also met back up with Lisa as well
[2:02:18] <+skyshinecrusader> gun toter andy
[2:02:18] <%hereiam407> Da udda side

[2:02:32] <%Shad0wTag> @qonfiguration The Reggie everywhere system has helped
[2:02:35] <ry4n_c00per> 2F connects to 1F, for a later puzzle
[2:02:37] <NireFuster> @qonfiguration I'm legitimately surprised about how well they've both been at the solutions in this game
[2:02:41] <%dds333a> A whole lotta locked shit
[2:02:41] <Overloard> i think theres no map because its a non continuous space

[2:04:43] <Enn19> IS it a covering?
[2:04:44] <+Breaknoon> "Hit them trash cans some more" -Akira Yamaoka
[2:04:46] <TheButtravage> Just try to stick everything in your inventory onto the electric wires.
[2:04:56] <NireFuster> @shad0wtag I'm definitely gonna go back and watch that on the vod, that scene is incredible
[2:05:06] <Onorekian> my phone did a noise and I jumped, SIlent Hill is getting to me

[2:06:11] <%Shad0wTag> @NireFuster It was but I can't say the emotion landed on the lads, they were more so onboard with Harry's reaction
[2:06:12] <TheButtravage> Ah yes, the fist bookshelf mimic of the game.

[2:06:33] <umbraawitch> @NireFuster i get that, why that happened to lisa is a bit vague
[2:06:37] <amiavamp> Don't worry about the blood, that just adds to the decor
[2:06:38] <overlord_nico> Super Mario 64 had a bookshelf enemy
[2:06:40] <cthulu_fearlock> What is the DEAL with this HILL? Not so quiet to me unless I mute everything. smh woolieT

[2:07:33] <NireFuster> @umbraawitch She always seemed to be almost part of Silent Hill with how weird she acted... kinda like another supporting female character in the franchise
[2:07:34] <jetstreamlove_R> Bloodborne protag would have a field trip in Silent Hill
[2:07:34] <DrkJP520> combine the antique pipe with the green herb

[2:08:06] <umbraawitch> @NireFuster yeah i still thought you-know-who was more impactful though

[2:08:18] <+gpallas> So 2F connects to 1F
[2:08:22] <qonfiguration> SH4 is about that

[2:18:26] <%ThePich> it's *also* drugs
[2:18:26] <jman13131313> and sex
[2:18:27] <+Fefe41> Silent hill is actually a huge cartel operation
[2:18:27] <%HeroToxiko> bad trip
[2:18:27] <AngryAsian5> Little of column A, little of column B
[2:18:28] <Treasure_Vault> The drugs get you closer to the evil

[2:18:45] <jett_eyes> I always saw Silent Hill as a super intense therapy session
[2:18:46] <atomizedstream> you gotta find the church somehow
[2:18:56] <atomizedstream> *fund
[2:18:59] <KaiserMario> The fog is just drugs

[2:19:24] <cartakus> Huh suspicious
[2:19:29] <%Shad0wTag> @jett_eyes Thats exactly what it is, except Silent Hill itself is a rude fucking therapist that would kill you for not making a breakthrough
[2:19:30] <+Breaknoon> This is what sinning gets you
[2:19:32] <AngryAsian5> Just say no, Silent Hill!
[2:19:35] <dalmek> "this is your brain" normal silent hill. "this is your brain on drugs" this place
[2:19:39] <+Shady_Zaku> @jett_eyes especially shattered memories
[2:19:44] <+Joe2187> silent hill is based on a real town in america, where they hit a vein of natural methan and the entire town sunk into a pit of fire and still burns some 70 years later with firey smokey sinkholes lining the land
[2:19:52] <DrkJP520> Silent Hill isn't big on jump scares. And this one probably has the most out of the first 3 games.
[2:20:02] <DSD24> @Shad0wTag Silent Hill would totally kill you if your card declined during the appointment
[2:20:05] <+Breaknoon> @Joe2187 That's the movie
[2:20:09] <%HeroToxiko> @dalmek hits the pan with egg but the transition from the movie happens instead
[2:20:11] <+skyshinecrusader> but wha if?
[2:20:12] <jetstreamlove_R> Pyramid Head's Head is just a huge Vabe machine sitting on his head LUL

[3:24:14] <JDebss> New intro Pog
[3:24:15] <%dds333a> Classic
[3:24:15] <qonfiguration> Here you have to unlock the UFO ending (it gives you a laser gun)
[3:24:16] <shieldecho> So outrageous the toll
[3:24:16] <@Menitta> I'm insane and save like 20 times lol
[3:24:17] <andre11dr> The other ending are either goofy ore really depressing
[3:24:19] <JeoDood> watch all endings
[3:24:19] <%superc37> oh wow they just completely ignored the new intro
[3:24:21] <+TheNihilistEnthusiast> If you get the UFO ending you get the laser gun on the next playthru
[3:24:22] <DrkJP520> search for the ufo ending. that's from SH1
[3:24:25] <tigerfang86> she was the ULTRA NURSE
[3:24:25] <shieldecho> You can lose all you have
[3:24:26] <%dds333a> LUL
[3:24:31] <Treasure_Vault> high mental hp
[3:24:31] <puluxor> What did she ever do to you?
[3:24:31] <dukenux> She was the head nurse
[3:24:32] <DSD24> Lisa was big cursed
[3:24:32] <qonfiguration> She took personal care of Alessa
[3:24:32] <+DatAsuna> silenthillmemories dot net has them all on a page if you search silent hill1  ending
[3:24:33] <+Jiggisnipe> and non hostile
[3:24:35] <qonfiguration> THat's why the guilt
[3:24:36] <lotharrio> UFO endings have their own canon.
[3:24:36] <+Ether101_Prime> I don't think she got pirosited.
[3:24:37] <SainEdge> Ufo ending in homecoming is so dumb, you can get it like any other normal ending on your first playtrough LUL
[3:24:39] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @jorniev
[3:24:41] <%livlinn> YouTubing is fine joofbPop
[3:24:44] <+xenoboost> man I want a cybil sh game
[3:24:46] <%HeroToxiko> you could almost say she was BURNED out?
[3:24:47] <+mechslayer71> wait did they finish?
[3:24:52] <dukenux> She didn't do anything bad really, she just got to close to Alessa
[3:24:55] <jett_eyes> burn victim?
[3:24:56] <%dds333a> @mechslayer71 yep
[3:24:57] <+SolidusRex> Cheryl is the reincarnation of Alessa
[3:24:59] <+Ether101_Prime> Not even close.
[3:24:59] <qonfiguration> Alessa split herself to not give birth to god
[3:25:01] <NireFuster> Cheryl was a half of a soul of Alessa
[3:25:02] <BlackermanZX> cheryl was half the soul of alessa
[3:25:05] <%hereiam407> Its weird
[3:25:07] <+Bitscreed> @WoolieVersus It's a split-soul thing.
[3:25:10] <+Breaknoon> dat mandolin
[3:25:11] <jorniev> a SINGLE GUY MADE all the  CG.
[3:25:11] <lotharrio> Astral projection fuckery. She's sending out an avatar.
[3:25:12] <tigerfang86> she used the small amount of god power she had to split her soul
[3:25:12] <konarius> The real reward was Alessas revenge and all the people we killed thinking they were monsters.
[3:25:13] <peachy996> Pat could tell you
[3:25:13] <+mechslayer71> @dds333a damn this game short. I missed most of it
[3:25:13] <+DatAsuna> man those cop pants are shiny
[3:25:14] <%Indigo_Automaton> Alessa was kept alive after her burning for 7 years, so that's why she was older
[3:25:15] <%MyNameIsRasus> Chreryl split herself to not birth the god
[3:25:18] <+SilverDevilfish> Cheryl is Alessa's V
[3:25:18] <%superc37> woolie you are like 8 degrees of wrong
[3:25:22] <%MyNameIsRasus> Alessa*
[3:25:22] <dukenux> It's weird. Silent Hill 3 answers some of these questions

[3:25:31] <%Fnir> Sheryl is like the innocent part of Alessa
[3:25:32] <+Ether101_Prime> Cheryl is a split off of Alessa.
[3:25:32] <%hereiam407> Yes
[3:25:33] <derap41> Sure yeah why not
[3:25:33] <brunoberserk> alessa split her soul

[3:25:49] <DSD24> What's up with those pillar
[3:25:53] <NireFuster> @horriblegoatdemon can't wait.. yipee
[3:25:54] <TheButtravage> @WoolieVersus Harry's daughter Cheryl, is a split off portion of Alessa.  Alessa split her soul to avoid completing the ritual and so there was a portion of her that wasn't eternally suffering.
[3:25:54] <%livlinn> Yep yep
[3:25:56] <%MyNameIsRasus> V and Urizen
[3:25:57] <sweet_gravy> yes. alessa split her soul to stop the birth of god
[3:25:58] <AngryAsian5> That's pretty much it Woolie
[3:25:58] <BurdRightsActivist> D:
[3:26:00] <JeoDood> yep yep
[3:26:01] <JDebss> Kami and Piccolo
[3:26:02] <Overloard> kinda funny how everyone you find with the exception of cybil was involved in the big conspiracy
[3:26:04] <%dds333a> :(
[3:26:05] <NireFuster> @woolieversus New intro!
[3:26:05] <+Ether101_Prime> It was her soul.
[3:26:07] <tigerfang86> it was her!
[3:26:07] <KaiserMario> ohhhh
[3:26:07] <+Malchiah_Tenabre> @horriblegoatdemon but then half way through goes off on a tangent about some random deep lore
[3:26:09] <lotharrio> That's how you get the devil trigger.
[3:26:10] <%hereiam407> Yep
[3:26:14] <%dds333a> Yep, astrally
[3:26:15] <KaiserMario> ooohhh...
[3:26:15] <+TheMonsterSV> HELLO YOUNG KAMI!
[3:26:18] <qonfiguration> The otherworld was basically her subconscious manifesting and calling for help
[3:26:20] <majindusto> Yep
[3:26:20] <KaiserMario> hmmmm
[3:26:22] <SaltyAzteca> ITS ALL COMIN TOGETHER
[3:26:27] <sweet_gravy> @horriblegoatdemon explains it wrong
[3:26:27] <+Byr0nX> echo
[3:26:29] <SainEdge> Wollie gets it PogChamp
[3:26:29] <DrkJP520> alessa tryin to stop you?
[3:26:31] <+Breaknoon> Alessa was the other half of her soul
[3:26:32] <+TopTieramisu> maths
[3:26:34] <derap41> Try to tell the cops that
[3:26:34] <jorniev> THE dude who made all the CG spend 2000 hours making it and slept under his desk
[3:26:35] <+hypecactuar> i still cant believe one guy animated those cutscenes
[3:26:37] <+ElBuraindo> yep
[3:26:38] <+Ether101_Prime> That was her soul not her physical body.
[3:26:40] <waltzqueen> Yes!
[3:26:40] <+Byr0nX> the child is the reincarnation
[3:26:40] <+Vokkan> this lore NotLikeThis
[3:26:41] <+Jaromero435> The math chekcs out
[3:26:43] <shieldecho> Okay so 7yo Alessa split herself in two so she wouldn't birth Satan and destroy the world and that's Cheryl, then after you kill Satan Alessa, now 14, gives you her remaining power and that's the new baby
[3:26:43] <%dds333a> @drkjp520 to draw cheryl
[3:26:49] <%abyssfots> abyssfots subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[3:26:50] <%MyNameIsRasus> That was her soul but yeah pretty much
[3:26:51] <brunoberserk> @TheMonsterSV  all these squares make a circle
[3:26:56] <+ElBuraindo> they literally add up to her adult age
[3:26:58] <NireFuster> @hypecactuar He had to live in the offices to animate all of them
[3:26:59] <KaiserMario> yeyeyeyeye
[3:27:00] <%livlinn> Alessa is 17 right?
[3:27:05] <%slimmixrp> SH3 completes this particular story

[3:27:29] <+gpallas> @livlinn 14. Heather is 17
[3:27:31] <DrkJP520> ufo is silent hill 1. dog is silent hill 2
[3:27:34] <sweet_gravy> @datasuna lol you may as well just recommend the wiki lmao
[3:27:35] <dukenux> She split herself 7 years ago, that'd make Cheryl 7 and the remaining Alessa 14
[3:27:36] <waltzqueen> Big screen  please
[3:27:37] <zentzen> now  on to silent hill 2?
[3:27:38] <28moogles> The non-Cheryl half of Alessa continued to just be in Alessa's body. She just makes her self look younger when she appears to you.
[3:27:41] <JDebss> Fantastic playthrough Woolz!
[3:27:44] <%dds333a> That blooper fmv is such incredible CG
[3:27:48] <%livlinn> @gpallas Ohhh

[3:27:57] <majindusto> 5 endings
[3:28:06] <qonfiguration> The Alessa you saw is a psychic projection, the real one looks like a Kebab
[3:28:07] <waltzqueen> Put it up
[3:28:11] <andre11dr> So ...where do we start explaining the enemies
[3:28:16] <+DatAsuna> plus describes the unlock conditions you needed for them
[3:28:18] <+TheMonsterSV> Cheer500
[3:28:20] <KaiserMario> can't go back
[3:28:23] <sweet_gravy> @datasuna Oh sorry I thought you meant as like an explainer
[3:28:25] <BlackermanZX> goop and kaufman quest
[3:28:30] <TheButtravage> @28moogles Yeah, the projected Alessa is the 7 year old version of her in the school uniform, the physical body is the burnt one that's 14 years old.
[3:28:31] <shieldecho> @andre11dr I mean most of them in this one is "What is Alessa scared of"

[3:28:33] <qonfiguration> @WoolieVersus they expected you to see the ending with kaufman using the goop and get the idea
[3:28:34] <%dds333a> @andre11dr it's alessa all the way down Kappa
[3:28:41] <+TheNihilistEnthusiast> ya you can easily mess that side quest up
[3:28:41] <NireFuster> @andre11dr Well all enemies in SH1 reflect Alessa's traumas and fears so its relatively eady
[3:28:48] <TalkingDog1> just got here, what ending did they get?
[3:28:49] <%hereiam407> Clock Tower 3: "Alessa"
[3:28:50] <waltzqueen> Movie  time
[3:28:51] <Narratorway> Indian Runner is the real test.  You can end up completely skipping that and never know it.
[3:28:55] <NireFuster> @talkingdog1 Good+
[3:28:55] <+Breaknoon> Yeah, really easy to miss, the + part of the ending is saving Cybil, like Bad+
[3:28:55] <%superc37> good+
[3:29:00] <TheButtravage> @TalkingDog1 Good+
[3:29:00] <horriblegoatdemon> Yeah you're supposed to play this game a bunch of times to figure out the goop shit
[3:29:02] <TalkingDog1> PogChamp
[3:29:03] <shieldecho> The real symbolic shit doesn't start till SH2
[3:29:17] <zedravan> the video by  LamboworldX has a good UFO version
[3:29:17] <Onorekian> unregistered hypercam 2
[3:29:18] <%dds333a> @shieldecho this game has it, but yeah LUL
[3:29:19] <+DatAsuna> there are good uploads
[3:29:20] <+Bitscreed> @Narratorway Yeah, if you're laser focused on the objective it's easy to miss all the Kauffman stuff
[3:29:24] <Sadnehs> This hill sure is loud
[3:29:25] <+Breaknoon> SH1>Everything else
[3:29:29] <GHouseduivel> Hypercam unregistered 50 bitrate
[3:29:29] <+SolidusRex> You are meant to get the Good ending first where Cybil dies before you learn how to save Cybil and get the Good+ ending, that's why it's so obtuse
[3:29:30] <+TheNihilistEnthusiast> there is good, good+, bad, bad+ doggo, and ufo
[3:29:31] <qonfiguration> This otherworld is symbolic too, but more straightforward. You can see the monsters in her drawings, her books and stuff
[3:29:37] <%dds333a> oh god LUL
[3:29:45] <%townzzzzz> may have to put a slient hill 1
[3:29:46] <qonfiguration> Everything's linked to her stay at the hospital
[3:29:47] <Artoo__The_Me> Unregistered unhyperbolic timevideo
[3:29:48] <+DatAsuna> 4 normal endings plus 1 joke end
[3:29:52] <peachy996> imagine if a sh had 14 endings
[3:29:58] <DrkJP520> don't accidentally look at sequel endings
[3:30:01] <+DatAsuna> You got Good+
[3:30:04] <NireFuster> @qonfiguration Yep,even Harry says it too, that this is reflecting someone's nightmares
[3:30:04] <majindusto> Good+
[3:30:06] <qonfiguration> You got the good ending plus
[3:30:06] <+Bitscreed> You got Good+
[3:30:12] <DSD24> Jesus Bad+
[3:30:15] <konarius> meh, it is not obtuse if you "wallfking" and inspecting every pixel like woolie
[3:30:19] <DSD24> How bad is that gonna be
[3:30:20] <@Menitta> Good Plus is considered the canon one?
[3:30:25] <NireFuster> Good+ is the best, canon ending btw.
[3:30:25] <+Jaromero435> bad + LUL
[3:30:32] <+Breaknoon> @Menitta Yes
[3:30:34] <+SolidusRex> Good or Good+ are canon, it doesn't matter which one
[3:30:36] <ry4n_c00per> bad + is really depressing lol
[3:30:37] <%dds333a> Isn't Good canon
[3:30:40] <QueequegTheater> @Menitta The UFO endings in each game are all canon to each other
[3:30:41] <WonderSign> Canon is cybil dies
[3:30:42] <dukenux> Bad+ would be saving Cybil, but not giving Kauffman the goop?
[3:30:45] <+gpallas> @Menitta I think it's regular Good
[3:30:46] <qonfiguration> Good + is not canon sadly
[3:30:46] <Arqartur0> moody light stream?
[3:30:47] <konarius> Cybill is never mentioned tho
[3:30:47] <28moogles> @NireFuster Nah, Good- is canon to SH3
[3:30:47] <waltzqueen> @woolieversus put it on screen please?
[3:30:50] <TheButtravage> @NireFuster I was under the impression good- was canon since there is nothing about Cybil after this game.
[3:30:50] <konarius> dead or alive
[3:30:53] <%livlinn> shiaSnack shiaSip
[3:30:56] <stalestloaf> im sorry whaaaaat?
[3:30:58] <@Menitta> @QueequegTheater oh thats cool I love that
[3:31:00] <stalestloaf> Silent hiiill?
[3:31:04] <+mr_drucifer> @ry4n_c00per yeah that's the one I got first and it kinda haunted me for awhile lol
[3:31:04] <andre11dr> I think the canon ending is that Cibil dies
[3:31:05] <stalestloaf> uwu
[3:31:09] <%livlinn> Ye, Good is the canon
[3:31:09] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:31:13] <sweet_gravy> @thebuttravage Why would there be anything about Cybil after this??
[3:31:21] <+Breaknoon> if kauffman doesnt get the goop you fight Alessa instead of the demon
[3:31:23] <NireFuster> I don't think that Cybil not appearing means she died
[3:31:28] <qonfiguration> the quality
[3:31:29] <waltzqueen> UFO  canon
[3:31:30] <%oneimportantthing> So uh, would you like to swap to SH2 now?
[3:31:33] <NireFuster> She probably went back to her police work
[3:31:40] <%townzzzzz> VHS looking ass
[3:31:41] <sweet_gravy> Good and good+ are equally plausible. there's no confirmation of which is canon
[3:31:45] <+Malchiah_Tenabre> In this one the metroid saves you
[3:31:47] <DSD24> Oh Cybil died in this
[3:31:52] <QueequegTheater> RIP Kaufmann
[3:31:53] <dukenux> Cybil died on that carousel

[3:40:49] <dukenux> new outro music LUL
[3:40:52] <qonfiguration> All CGI by ONE GUY who WASN'T PAID
[3:40:52] <hartounian> up there with Aeriths theme
[3:40:55] <%dds333a> actually good
[3:40:55] <%pungotcha> doot doot doot
[3:40:59] <tigerfang86> its all about the notes you DONT PLAY
[3:40:59] <+Byr0nX> Kenpachi Ramasami, wat are you doing here?
[3:41:00] <%dds333a> woolieSMUG
[3:41:04] <fmbboaventura> It kinda reminds me of the nekomata theme from persona 2 for some reason?
[3:41:04] <qonfiguration> He had to live in the office
[3:41:04] <blue_grave> yeah i just noticed that reggie shaved
[3:41:07] <jetstreamlove_R> Magnifique!
[3:41:09] <DrkJP520> isn't this the chrono cross battle theme?
[3:41:12] <slackerunchained> An 'Auteur' if ypu will.
[3:41:14] <NireFuster> CGI all done by a single guy, wasn't payed, and had to LIVE IN THE OFFICES
[3:41:15] <TheButtravage> @WoolieVersus So, give us your impressions of the first Silent Hill guys?
[3:41:16] <+Bitscreed> "DIC"
[3:41:17] <+zodd_godd> Did they already beat the game?
[3:41:17] <TheProtomanBlues> This would be great for Woolie's ending clip compilation
[3:41:19] <SoaringTrumpet> exactly
[3:41:19] <%dds333a> @fmbboaventura I hear it
[3:41:23] <GoatArmageddon> Akira Yamaoka the GOAT
[3:41:26] <ShotgunGabe> what a hill, with silence.
[3:41:29] <%Seancicle> see you later on racoon wars
[3:41:33] <heart_ablaze> something from no more heroes
[3:41:35] <SoaringTrumpet> like hannah barbera ending
[3:41:35] <TheButtravage> @zodd_godd They just finished.
[3:41:36] <captain_elsewhere> dic
[3:41:37] <horriblegoatdemon> No More Heroes 4 credits music
[3:41:39] <+skyshinecrusader> End of Ben 10
[3:41:41] <miucsa51> Coming up next on ABC Silent hill
[3:41:45] <%dds333a> like captain N Kappa
[3:41:45] <NireFuster> That was Silent Hill!
[3:41:52] <derap41> That was a game...I think
[3:41:52] <majindusto> Silent Hill ...Directed by the same guy as the Gravity  Rush games
[3:41:53] <andre11dr> This one is scarier, SH 2 is more depressing, SH 3 depending on what you interpret is more disturbing
[3:41:54] <JDebss> Shits locked the movie
[3:41:54] <GoatArmageddon> 70s anime type beat
[3:41:55] <+Bitscreed> This playthrough was a real treat to watch. Thanks guys. :)
[3:41:56] <Aussie_Manny> Wait, that happened?!
[3:41:58] <jorniev> THAT WAS FUN
[3:41:59] <%livlinn> forgottenFun shiaHypers forgottenFun
[3:41:59] <28moogles> So Silent Hill 2 is a lot better
[3:42:01] <jett_eyes> REGGIE SHAVED
[3:42:01] <%hereiam407> Put the baby down
[3:42:03] <NireFuster> DON'T touch baby!
[3:42:06] <AngryAsian5> That was fun!
[3:42:07] <+Byr0nX> You save Heather tho
[3:42:07] <qonfiguration> You guys did so well. I think God made you avoid Survival Horror to nerf you
[3:42:08] <%MightyDuckShoes> that bad ending reaction was nostalgic as fuck
[3:42:08] <Ultra_Pancake> Great LP 10/10
[3:42:09] <BurdRightsActivist> THE BABY
[3:42:09] <%baka_sugoi> da bay be
[3:42:09] <Josef_Stryker> DON'T Shake the Baby!
[3:42:10] <%MyNameIsRasus> Or, pick up the baby but never go to Maine
[3:42:10] <Blank9> put'em back where you found'em
[3:42:12] <%dds333a> THAT IS HIS DAUGHTER
[3:42:12] <captain_elsewhere> man you know what shouldve had a saturday morning cartoon series ? the matrix
[3:42:12] <%hereiam407> Silent Hill 2 is amazing
[3:42:13] <heart_ablaze> leave the baby to rot
[3:42:14] <0cash> no, pick the baby. Or else it burns and suffers
[3:42:16] <+Shady_Zaku> babyface reggie
[3:42:19] <+Shady_Zaku> just noticed
[3:42:21] <tigerfang86> Harry just wanted his dang daughter!!!!
[3:42:21] <%Pillagius> Baby gattai?
[3:42:23] <+Malchiah_Tenabre> eat the baby
[3:42:23] <slackerunchained> NOTHING good can come from picking up random trash-babies...
[3:42:23] <andre11dr> DLC baby ,better than last baby
[3:42:24] <AngryAsian5> DON‚ÄôT adopt demon children
[3:42:25] <TheProtomanBlues> Oh fuck, what happened to Reggie
[3:42:26] <+Byr0nX> saved some part
[3:42:28] <jetstreamlove_R> learn from samus, kill the baby!
[3:42:32] <jorniev> SILENT HILL 3 WAS GOOD TOO
[3:42:35] <jett_eyes> WAIT he still has a little bit
[3:42:37] <+Ether101_Prime> I don't think he saved that part of town.
[3:42:37] <Blank9> harry just keeps it up with "I don't CARE mothman, where is my DAUGHTER"
[3:42:37] <Overloard> based and harry-pilled
[3:42:37] <tigerfang86> Damn
[3:42:38] <CoffeeSlice> bruh where's the beard tho
[3:42:39] <+Lionkevinson> Reggie shaved!?
[3:42:40] <jetstreamlove_R> absorb it's power
[3:42:41] <%MyNameIsRasus> That's a lot
[3:42:41] <%MightyDuckShoes> everyone who beat the game and saw that ending. And we're too young to know how common a trope that was.
[3:42:42] <dukenux> Just like with the baby birds: Don't touch them, otherwise you'll leave your smell all over it, and its mother will abandon it
[3:42:42] <+Mekhet09> you should watch all ufo ending together.
[3:42:46] <+skyshinecrusader> THE STRONGEST MAN
[3:42:49] <tigerfang86> think about how hard it is to shoot something 30 times
[3:42:49] <captain_elsewhere> hang on elmo was a trash baby, oh wait... Kappa
[3:42:51] <tigerfang86> that's hard
[3:42:51] <BlackermanZX> and woolie still had 200 pistol bullets
[3:42:52] <Enn19> Unless it's in America Kappa
[3:42:52] <28moogles> His name is "Incubus"
[3:42:56] <Renegadorade> but what if the baby is invisible
[3:42:56] <horriblegoatdemon> If humanity just disarms Mothman spontaneously combusts
[3:43:00] <%jonblnt> Damn clean shaven Reggie
[3:43:00] <Sapphire_Breeze> he was weakened with the Heinz
[3:43:01] <qonfiguration> Silent Hill 3 contains baby adventures. Also remember Mothman was incomplete and kinda wanted to die
[3:43:03] <TheButtravage> @WoolieVersus To be fair, mothman wasn't complete since Kauffman induced an abortion.
[3:43:05] <JDebss> Silent hill 3 is my favourite.  Come at me
[3:43:05] <+mechslayer71> I love how the goal posts have moved from "1 is good too" to " silent hill 2 is much better"
[3:43:06] <+Ether101_Prime> There's a retcon later that explains why Hery was able to take down that devil.
[3:43:09] <AngryAsian5> To be fair, this new baby is the best baby LUL
[3:43:11] <%hereiam407> Lets get more mothman
[3:43:12] <linSP> just toss it an aramasa
[3:43:13] <NireFuster> Lmao did Woolie have like 100 pistol bullets until the end? LUL
[3:43:13] <ShotgunGabe> This would be a different story is Harry is resident evil character. punching moth man like Boulder.
[3:43:15] <DrkJP520> time for the sh1 wiki dive
[3:43:20] <majindusto> Can't  wait for Woolie VS Silent Hill 2
[3:43:22] <%hereiam407> Its very good for being this old
[3:43:24] <brunoberserk> @WoolieVersus the demon was incomplete , the ritual failed and he is weakened
[3:43:24] <+AkronymCLT> Eric Andre takes down the Antichrist
[3:43:25] <%livlinn> Remember, Satan was weakened by the goo woolieMIRIN
[3:43:25] <%MyNameIsRasus> @NireFuster probably 200
[3:43:25] <andre11dr> Well that's cause it's the unfinished version of the demon
[3:43:25] <+Breaknoon> Not reliant on jump scares
[3:43:26] <bamberfool> cozy game
[3:43:26] <dukenux> Silent Hill 3 final boss is so fucked
[3:43:27] <+birddotexe> Mothman was incomplete?
[3:43:32] <horriblegoatdemon> Canonically Harry showed up without ammo and that's how he won
[3:43:37] <+Byr0nX> if you didn't save it, youd have a time paradox and Heather wouldn't exist probably.
[3:43:54] <qonfiguration> @WoolieVersus fun fact if you show up without ammo it dies
[3:43:59] <TheButtravage> @horriblegoatdemon Oh shit, I forgot that was a thing.
[3:44:00] <28moogles> Guys stop spoiling SH3 ffs
[3:44:02] <andre11dr> The true SH2 final boss is so fucked
[3:44:05] <leomuratore> Games didn't always show you around back then
[3:44:12] <%dds333a> @birddotexe of course
[3:44:17] <+0neReeler> Resident Evil Remaster
[3:44:30] <Estwilde> That's 100% what playing Call of Cthulhu is. You really aren't playing to win, just to see how long you can stay alive/sane :D
[3:44:38] <+Breaknoon> if you run out of ammo during the final boss it'll just die, failsafe.
[3:44:48] <+gpallas> You were playing 'much' better this stream
[3:44:53] <peachy996> SH1 has Neutral
[3:44:54] <TueDuffCity> Don't ber dumb and say this stuff aight
[3:44:55] <+0neReeler> lightning dodge
[3:44:55] <NireFuster> And somehow, junk aside, Woolie managed to make this into a fighting game and lab the hell out of it...
[3:44:56] <+xenoboost> sh1 is best horror, sh2 is best story, sh3 is best tech
[3:44:57] <Slim_Lipid> it's bad on purpose
[3:45:03] <%FrostedZaibatsu> We need a tank control 3D fighting game
[3:45:04] <qonfiguration> I had never seen someone juke and tech this game
[3:45:10] <dukenux> @Breaknoon so if i went into the final fight with one bullet, i could technically one shot her?
[3:45:10] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:45:16] <konarius> we get it all you know the 24 year old trivia
[3:45:21] <JDebss> I think SH3 has better horror
[3:45:23] <iamtheTwitchghost> REmake with analogue controls is nuts
[3:45:30] <peachy996> I like 3's horror more.
[3:45:32] <%hereiam407> Rahr
[3:45:34] <28moogles> SH2 > SH3 > SH1 > SH4
[3:45:35] <%itstreylar> the tank controls in silent hill 2 are actually better than the non-tank controls though because the camera keeps changing
[3:45:38] <NireFuster> The moving camera helps a lot though, hard cuts from the RE games are very bad
[3:45:39] <horriblegoatdemon> Tank controls work with fixed camera angles and a cinematic camera like this
[3:45:40] <+Breaknoon> @dukenux I think you have to survive for a bit after shooting.
[3:45:44] <+0neReeler> remake with new controls is broken
[3:45:55] <dukenux> ah ok
[3:45:57] <BurdRightsActivist> SH1 SH3 SH2 SH4 << PT
[3:46:02] <BurdRightsActivist> (it never came out ): )
[3:46:07] <%dds333a> Excellent game
[3:46:09] <@Menitta> REmake is weird because I dont like tank controls but I dont wanna play it with the analog controls LUL
[3:46:10] <dukenux> @28moogles same tbh
[3:46:13] <%MyNameIsRasus> Good+ is canon
[3:46:13] <andre11dr> Man it sure sucks they only made 3 games, but hey quality over quantity you know
[3:46:14] <%dds333a> I'd say so
[3:46:14] <%hereiam407> Sure
[3:46:15] <+Jiggisnipe> who cares
[3:46:18] <+DatAsuna> It only really sets up 3
[3:46:20] <Dopamien> survival horror, but with QWOP controls
[3:46:26] <slackerunchained> First-Person VR Silent Hill, when?
[3:46:26] <dukenux> 4 deserves to be listed among the 3, idc what Pat says
[3:46:27] <%dds333a> sure is
[3:46:30] <NireFuster> Good and Good+ are both canon
[3:46:30] <%hereiam407> Let‚Äôs get at em
[3:46:33] <linSP> that bad- ending tho
[3:46:39] <%itstreylar> ufo is also canon
[3:46:39] <+bustawof> bustawof subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[3:46:41] <0cash> shattered memories
[3:46:42] <tigerfang86> SM is a spinoff pretty much
[3:46:42] <0cash> is r
[3:46:44] <0cash> eally good
[3:46:46] <$oFlooofy> A retelling of silent hill 1
[3:46:46] <%dds333a> half and half Kappa
[3:46:47] <JDebss> @dukenux NODDERS
[3:46:48] <kingra> SH4 is actually not terrible
[3:46:48] <bamberfool> 4 was scariest imo
[3:46:49] <+DatAsuna> No, you play her memory of harry
[3:46:50] <28moogles> Shattered Memories is considered a reimagining of SH1.
[3:46:50] <+0neReeler> thats 4
[3:46:52] <BlackermanZX> nah you play as an alt version of harry
[3:46:54] <+solzan2000> SH4 was supposed to be a spinnoff
[3:46:56] <+DatAsuna> it was
[3:46:58] <heart_ablaze> it's a reinterpreted version on sh 1
[3:46:59] <NireFuster> Shattered Memories is an alternative what if scenario.
[3:47:01] <SainEdge> horror also dosent need to be super frightening, it can be creepy, unsettling, without the player shitting their pants
[3:47:05] <+Shady_Zaku> My wrists borderline EXPLODED at bad- end
[3:47:09] <horriblegoatdemon> The Room is underrated. All Team Silent games are good
[3:47:11] <andre11dr> Origins>SH4
[3:47:13] <Fuji808> Shattered Memories is good, fuck TRSHE.
[3:47:13] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Are your Memories of that game Shattered?
[3:47:17] <+0neReeler> they're all different..?
[3:47:18] <iamtheTwitchghost> i liked the room
[3:47:19] <%hereiam407> 4 is still good
[3:47:21] <jett_eyes> Ending to SM is really good
[3:47:26] <%dds333a> remember his name Kappa
[3:47:28] <jorniev> LIKE IN SHUTTER ISLAND
[3:47:29] <JDebss> I love 4
[3:47:30] <qonfiguration> "THIS GAME PLAYS YOU"
[3:47:32] <+birddotexe> It‚Äôs her imagining of the events of SH1 from Harry‚Äôs perspective
[3:47:32] <kingra> @andre11dr That's is just straight up wrong
[3:47:34] <$oFlooofy> @hereiam407 yeah like half of 4 Kappa
[3:47:34] <%hereiam407> Kaufman
[3:47:35] <slackerunchained> I actually *liked* 'The Room' tbh... but i admittedly have notoriously shit-taste.
[3:47:37] <%dds333a> He found a new. line of work LUL
[3:47:38] <+DatAsuna> worth revisiting honestly

[3:47:45] <%hereiam407> It‚Äôs Kaufman
[3:47:49] <qonfiguration> Silent Hill 4 The Room is good this is canon
[3:47:53] <slackerunchained> I mean, i LIKE Evillak, for Chrissakes...
[3:47:55] <peachy996> Kauffman too
[3:47:58] <dukenux> @WoolieVersus For future reference, if you plan to revisit series: Silent Hill 3 is a proper sequel to the storyline of 1. Silent Hill 2 is a self contained story set in the town
[3:47:59] <Futurecity10> shattered memories is SH3.5
[3:47:59] <NireFuster> You also get different characters and interactions based on what you see and what you do
[3:48:02] <horriblegoatdemon> Kauffman AKA the worst psychologist ever
[3:48:06] <%MyNameIsRasus> ye
[3:48:08] <%dds333a> yep
[3:48:09] <qonfiguration> Yep
[3:48:13] <brunoberserk> yes
[3:48:16] <+DatAsuna> It's worth doing
[3:48:18] <%hereiam407> Yes
[3:48:18] <dukenux> Kaufmann partook in cult's shenanigans i think
[3:48:19] <iamtheTwitchghost> kauffman was great in that game
[3:48:20] <+Bitscreed> I never played SH4 but to me it looked way more faithful to the ideas and themes of the original trilogy than Downpour etc.
[3:48:21] <%dds333a> Dahlia is there too
[3:48:27] <majindusto> Silent Hill 4  is still good, especially  the story...And I will not hear any bad mothing of it.
[3:48:30] <andre11dr> Silent Hill 4 has the worst escort mission ever, also the room attacking you the most annoying shit ever
[3:48:31] <%dds333a> different versions too LUL
[3:48:34] <horriblegoatdemon> Professional psychologist screaming and throwing glasses around his office
[3:48:35] <+DatAsuna> Shattered Memories is probably my favourite story in the series
[3:48:41] <%hereiam407> Don‚Äôt worry about canon
[3:48:42] <+Shady_Zaku> Yeah
[3:48:44] <majindusto> *mouthing
[3:48:45] <%MyNameIsRasus> Yeah
[3:48:45] <NireFuster> UFO has its own Canon yep
[3:48:46] <azure_rivers> yep
[3:48:47] <TheButtravage> @Bitscreed 4 keeps the lore and atmosphere the same it just has some odd game jank ideas.
[3:48:51] <dukenux> @Bitscreed It was the last game made by the people from the orignal team
[3:48:51] <%dds333a> @horriblegoatdemon says, no, and walks out the door LUL
[3:48:53] <+Jiggisnipe> it's funny
[3:49:00] <jorniev> I LOVE THAT
[3:49:00] <+DatAsuna> 2 of course a close second
[3:49:02] <brunoberserk> IT GETS FUNNIER
[3:49:05] <slackerunchained> The dev team was notoriously ambiguous as to which ending of the game was supposed to be canon for future games
[3:49:06] <$oFlooofy> @andre11dr and dont forget the unkillable ghosts! fuck those guys
[3:49:06] <Aussie_Manny> If I stare at my poster of Captain America for long enough, will the enemies look like him?
[3:49:07] <+Shady_Zaku> UFO endings are canon to eachother yea
[3:49:07] <Estwilde> forked timelines that are all canon? PogChamp
[3:49:09] <%jinking79> no ufo ending in downpour
[3:49:09] <+Someitalian123> the joke endings have their own canon.
[3:49:13] <+DatAsuna> 2 basically has only silent hill in common
[3:49:16] <NireFuster> SH3 is the sequel to SH1, direct sequel
[3:49:16] <iamtheTwitchghost> ye
[3:49:18] <+Breaknoon> Yes
[3:49:18] <%dds333a> yep
[3:49:18] <dukenux> James Sunderland
[3:49:19] <%SveriSageAdvice> ye
[3:49:20] <superchunk121> Yes
[3:49:20] <%mr_sups> correct
[3:49:21] <jett_eyes> yes
[3:49:21] <+BelricPsytar> yes
[3:49:21] <%MyNameIsRasus> ye
[3:49:21] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> That was 2015, feels like forever ago
[3:49:22] <+Shady_Zaku> Yea
[3:49:23] <qonfiguration> Mr. Cihi got done dirty :(
[3:49:23] <%emMmDeeKay> What about the Silent Hill for PSP Vita?
[3:49:23] <brunoberserk> james
[3:49:24] <%Indigo_Automaton> James Sunderland
[3:49:25] <%hereiam407> James Sunderland
[3:49:25] <Eger007> sh2
[3:49:25] <%dds333a> MARY
[3:49:28] <BlackermanZX> 2 is depression hill
[3:49:34] <jorniev> ... yeah that guy...
[3:49:35] <+Breaknoon> different games that takes place in the same town
[3:49:36] <+IveGotALaserFace> Silent Hill 3 is the direct sequel to 1
[3:49:40] <Fuji808> SH2 has basically nothing in common with the story of SH1.
[3:49:41] <dukenux> 2 is more like Sadness Hill
[3:49:43] <28moogles> SH2 is an amazing game/story.
[3:49:47] <slackerunchained> Silent Hill's weirdness is rather non-discriminatory.
[3:49:49] <TheButtravage> @WoolieVersus Different stories and main characters but all the same town.
[3:49:49] <%dds333a> Kappa Kappa Kappa
[3:49:49] <fmbboaventura> SH2 still makes me uncomfortable as hell
[3:49:49] <DrkJP520> silent hill 2 is a standalone story, and i hope you'll tackle that one day soon
[3:49:52] <+Someitalian123> sh2 is almost it's own thing. but sh3 is a direct sequel
[3:49:52] <linSP> I love SH2 yaya
[3:49:55] <%hereiam407> Pyramid dude
[3:49:57] <+DatAsuna> The location's basically it yeah
[3:49:57] <Aussie_Manny> Ohh, I remember that! Super Best Friendcast had James Sunderland himself on! That was so cool.
[3:49:58] <qonfiguration> SH2 is the one that's truly considered straight up masterpiece
[3:50:04] <%dds333a> late
[3:50:07] <majindusto> Konami  were JERKS to Guy Cihi
[3:50:08] <+Shady_Zaku> I member that episode
[3:50:08] <JDebss> 2 makes me feel melancholy
[3:50:09] <+Jiggisnipe> Dirty Sync
[3:50:09] <%dds333a> LUL
[3:50:10] <%hereiam407> It‚Äôs really good
[3:50:11] <Onorekian> dirty ass sync
[3:50:13] <konarius> make them start with Born From a Wish for maximum confusion in SH2
[3:50:14] <+Bitscreed> The most non-spoiler thing you could say about Sh2 is it recontextualises Silent Hill as a place.
[3:50:28] <%livlinn> woolieDATTEBAYO woolieVS woolieMINHMAX
[3:50:28] <%MyNameIsRasus> hiding all the horseporn
[3:50:30] <+TheNihilistEnthusiast> Do you have any plans to play the next games?
[3:50:33] <Razeino> @WoolieVersus What's Thursdays stream then?
[3:50:34] <NireFuster> @bitscreed Pretty much Silent Hill but without an active cult
[3:50:51] <Dopamien> Prayge ending stream ritual
[3:50:53] <Fuji808> And that's an episode
[3:50:54] <qonfiguration> Congrats :)
[3:50:55] <%Indigo_Automaton> Nicely Done!
[3:50:59] <AllonBachuth> GG
[3:51:00] <majindusto> YOU DOUBTED  IT
[3:51:01] <andre11dr> I wish they made the Silent Hill 3 that they where originally gonna make, after they decided to change it to a sequel
[3:51:01] <Dakuu75> why you ashamed of your desktop woolz? is it half covered in icons? do you have a lewd wallpaper?
[3:51:01] <%livlinn> !uptime
[3:51:02] <@Moobot> @livlinn WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 59 minutes
[3:51:08] <brunoberserk> you blasted in the second session
[3:51:09] <%dds333a> sure would LUL
[3:51:16] <NireFuster> Super good playthrough, blasted through the game
[3:51:19] <TheButtravage> Could totally get the four first games done before Elden Ring, the games aren't very long.
[3:51:24] <+DatAsuna> 10 minutes of ending then labbbing P4a for the rest of the session
[3:51:24] <jett_eyes> So whats gonna happen Thursday?
[3:51:29] <%dds333a> a bit longer
[3:51:30] <%livlinn> kirinClap kirinClap kirinClap kirinClap kirinClap kirinClap
[3:51:32] <andre11dr> The original Silent Hill 3 was way more disturbing
[3:51:33] <Aussie_Manny> wow, short game
[3:51:33] <Treasure_Vault> You can run it in 1-2h
[3:51:38] <bigshedman> ADGQ Speedrun is 47:40 lol
[3:51:38] <jorniev> WHAT NOW?
[3:51:39] <dukenux> you could proably speedrun it in half hour with some cheesing
[3:51:40] <JDebss> Fantastic playthrough! @woolieversus
[3:51:40] <qonfiguration> What is your next adventure
[3:51:43] <Dakuu75> "bible DLC" I hope I remember that one, forever.
[3:51:45] <NireFuster> Yeah could totally make SH2-3 before E.R definitely but that's up to Woolz
[3:51:49] <Fuji808> If you speedrun it it's probably about an hour.
[3:51:52] <%dds333a> @jorniev of course LUL
[3:51:55] <%livlinn> What‚Äôs the speedrun average? 30-40 min?
[3:51:56] <+Shady_Zaku> @andre11dr original?
[3:52:01] <%dds333a> These are not all long games
[3:52:08] <+gpallas> You both did great this run
[3:52:21] <%dds333a> they got longer as they went on, which is standard
[3:52:22] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1478257606875815940?t=yjLm7ZYgulpaxSOSAEFNpA&s=19
[3:52:22] <leomuratore> Speedrun is around 50 minutes
[3:52:24] <+DatAsuna> especially as a child
[3:52:26] <slackerunchained> You were SO dialed into this game's thinking, tho, Reggie! :o
[3:52:27] <@Menitta> Some of those puzzles could've used slight more indication
[3:52:37] <dukenux> You did well with those puzzles, honestly
[3:52:38] <fanciful_fright> @Shady_Zaku they mean the original concept, which was never realize or existed so calling it original is kinda just incorrect
[3:52:38] <NireFuster> Take into consideration Woolie pretty much did a near completionist run, if he had just played through this would've been done last session
[3:52:38] <puluxor> That was the experience back in the day: you would get stuck
[3:52:39] <jett_eyes> I found a speedrun just under 30 mins
[3:52:43] <majindusto> SH2 THURSDAY!
[3:52:45] <@Menitta> The ALERT one should've simply had the first letters in bold
[3:52:45] <andre11dr> @shady_zaku SH3 was allegedly supposed to be something else but they decided against it and made it a sequel to 1
[3:52:50] <Zeif00> not mad at it tho, it was first game
[3:52:50] <Stofil42> does woolie know about the dentist drill in the soundtrack?
[3:53:06] <ShotgunGabe> any critic in the game besides doors not looking like doors?

[3:59:21] <peachy996> Gary Glitter
[3:59:25] <HeroSolaire> FBI never found anything in Michael Jackson house
[3:59:25] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:59:27] <%dds333a> As far as any of us know LUL
[3:59:28] <%kyh9> Kanye didn't rape anyone
[3:59:29] <AncyentMarinere> Kanye to Lil wayne to Jay Z have praised XXXTENTACION do what you will with that info
[3:59:30] <Aussie_Manny> Kanye's not as good as MJ.
[3:59:34] <leomuratore> On the extremes
[3:59:36] <PartialRecall1> micheal jackson was JUST AS if not more mentally ill than kanye no cap
[3:59:38] <+ReallyBigRocks> as far as we know
[3:59:38] <%Prevot> good thing it's not real then LUL
[3:59:39] <+0neReeler> kanye is just trolling
[3:59:41] <+Jiggisnipe> Kanye doesn't do bad things, he's just a dumbass
[3:59:43] <andre11dr> People don't know him but i will say Ariel Pink
[3:59:44] <%emMmDeeKay> Jim Carry, Antivaxxer
[3:59:44] <dukenux> as far as movies go, Mel Gibson
[3:59:46] <Chatterbox1991> i actually think Mark Walhberg is a pretty talented actor, makes the background of hate crimes sting that much harder
[3:59:46] <iamtheTwitchghost> HARD CRIME
[3:59:47] <+skyshinecrusader> MJ was chemically castrated and beaten
[3:59:48] <+monsieurfantastic> thank you woolie
[3:59:48] <Sapphire_Breeze> did MJ even touch kids?
[3:59:51] <peachy996> Gary Glitter IS a piece of shit and still the song from the Joker is still good
[3:59:54] <Razeino> Look into the Michal Jackson. He definitely didn't do it.
[3:59:55] <+BonerGirl> MICHAEL IS INNOCENT
[3:59:56] <slackerunchained> Let's focus on the positive: Steve Buscemi continues to be a really-stand-up-guy by all scrutiny. :)
[3:59:57] <%AlteisenReiseZ> I will dance with my tears in my eyes. You can take Blood on the Dance Floor from my COLD. DEAD. HANDS.
[3:59:57] <theheen> Kanye and MJ are different stratospheres yeah
[3:59:58] <Aussie_Manny> Their controversies are WAY different.
[3:59:58] <Estuko> Kanye West not doing his Kanye Best
[3:59:58] <+DatAsuna> ugly overpriced clothing
[3:59:59] <linSP> very cool!
[4:00:00] <+SolidusRex> MJ was innocent
[4:00:02] <NireFuster> MJ really?
[4:00:02] <dukenux> There are LOTS of showbiz people you could put aon that list
[4:00:03] <%dds333a> You could say this for literally Anyone LUL
[4:00:03] <+Ravenian96> Crime against fashion
[4:00:07] <%hereiam407> Don't touch kids, never touch kids
[4:00:08] <Aussie_Manny> Woolie just dissed the Yeezies. D:
[4:00:10] <+0neReeler> it was the jesus juice!
[4:00:12] <+DatAsuna> but yeah john lennon is legendarily awful
[4:00:13] <Narratorway> Having Opinions =/= Sexual Goddamned Assault
[4:00:16] <qonfiguration> How can that even qualify as a shoe
[4:00:16] <+TheMilkiestShake> @Chatterbox1991 Never seen him being better than okay in anything he's been in
[4:00:16] <azure_rivers> sadge
[4:00:16] <0cash> mj had a shitty dad
[4:00:21] <BlackermanZX> oof
[4:00:29] <+TheMilkiestShake> Bing Crosby a good shout too
[4:00:34] <+StooEsq> Joe Jackson is a fucking ghoul
[4:00:35] <GHouseduivel> Saying Joe Jackson was horrible under sells what he fucking did to Michael
[4:00:42] <%kyh9> Roman Polanski and MJ are pretty up there in terms of talent - morality discrepancy
[4:00:43] <dukenux> Kanye said some crazy shit, but he didn't do anything really morally reprehensible so far
[4:00:48] <andre11dr> Dose GG Alin count? LUL
[4:00:51] <studleydoorite> can we talk about Bo Jackson? what an athlete
[4:00:51] <+ReallyBigRocks> tbh most rockstars from the late 60s and 70s are alleged pedophiles
[4:00:56] <Chatterbox1991> @TheMilkiestShake  The Fighter with him and Christian Bale is arguably his best role
[4:01:00] <%jonblnt> Good answer
[4:01:00] <%dds333a> The fact is we just don't know LUL
[4:01:04] <+skyshinecrusader> He didnt do those things

[4:01:06] <+0neReeler> oh yea the puddin guy
[4:01:06] <theheen> Bowie was a bit of a nonce too right
[4:01:13] <NireFuster> Isn't there this one phone call of a father saying he wanted to ruin MJ?
[4:01:13] <%dds333a> So don't ever get your hopes up
[4:01:14] <%townzzzzz> "he made thriller"
[4:01:14] <Estuko> AHAHAHA

[4:01:35] <Dakuu75> @WoolieVersus if you thinking about who to raid TheSphereHunter is playing RE 4
[4:01:35] <peachy996> Ted Nugent's music is trash and "Cat Scratch Fever" is a one hit wonder
[4:01:35] <GHouseduivel> What about Suge Knight?
[4:01:36] <leomuratore> Marylin Manson though...
[4:01:36] <+Lionkevinson> What about r Kelly?

[4:01:46] <mark_collins45> GG Allin was just a stage performance and that was about it
[4:01:46] <Aussie_Manny> I don't wanna.
[4:01:47] <fairore> ugh
[4:01:48] <%dds333a> and Smears it on his face

[4:01:50] <cartakus> The punk asshat?
[4:01:50] <dukenux> R Kelly, oh YES
[4:01:50] <drunken_lemur> R. KELLY!
[4:01:51] <+ReallyBigRocks> he just gets up there and shits his britches
[4:01:55] <+skyshinecrusader> R.Kelly is way better of an example
[4:01:57] <+0neReeler> R.Kelly
[4:02:00] <+Breaknoon> GG Allen, Dont name your kid Jesus Christ
[4:02:05] <qonfiguration> So... Silent Hill was good
[4:02:06] <andre11dr> The 80s where wild

[4:02:08] <TheButtravage> Who the fuck is GG Alien?
[4:02:09] <mortificent> TRUE
[4:02:09] <%hereiam407> Man in the Mirror
[4:02:10] <%jinking79> K Relly

[4:02:14] <%baka_sugoi> billy jean
[4:02:14] <Aussie_Manny> Smooth Criminal!
[4:02:14] <+Jiggisnipe> @GHouseduivel more of an executive instead of an artist
[4:02:15] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @Razeino
[4:02:15] <+0neReeler> MJ discog
[4:02:17] <+KiroKadura> HP Lovecraft?
[4:02:17] <leomuratore> Off the Wall is insane to this day
[4:02:17] <Dakuu75> the Sonic 3 OST XD
[4:02:19] <%kyh9> You Rock My World is so good tho
[4:02:19] <peachy996> But Smooth Criminal though
[4:02:20] <Arqartur0> Fuck MJ, I'm more of a Snoop Dog
[4:02:22] <+Shady_Zaku> the fuck is that LMFAO
[4:02:23] <%FrostedZaibatsu> Only black uncles cant live without R.Kelly
[4:02:24] <+mechslayer71> just leave me alone? BOPPER

[4:02:26] <GurrenGyaru> The thing about micheal is that they never proved it and all accusation had bit sketchy energy
[4:02:26] <%dds333a> SLAVE TO THE RHYTHM
[4:02:28] <@Menitta> You've been hit by. Struck by. Truck.

[4:02:47] <+hypecactuar> bro r kelly has some good music but fkem

[4:02:52] <28moogles> There was no unbirthing
[4:02:58] <NireFuster> @dds333a not a lot of people know that one I think unfortunately
[4:02:58] <28moogles> She was talking about Alessa's womb
[4:02:59] <drunken_lemur> But PYT is pretty SUS
[4:03:02] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[4:03:03] <%dds333a> what she was saying isn't literal, but rather accurate
[4:03:05] <+ReallyBigRocks> The De-Birthening

[4:03:12] <Alt_Tab_streams> I'm sorry what are we talking abotu
[4:03:14] <peachy996> I'd say Marilyn Manson cuz I love his music but I know deep down he was the biggest asshole to his wives and girlfriends
[4:03:14] <%dds333a> @nirefuster true, but hey
[4:03:15] <leomuratore> @drunken_lemur well observed
[4:03:16] <%kyh9> Dahlia was implying exactly what you think she was implying
[4:03:16] <Zeif00> Unbirthing monkaS
[4:03:20] <slackerunchained> Stick with what you're good at, Dahlia: Gyromancy.
[4:03:35] <Arqartur0> UnBirth MJ, ReBirth Eazy E
[4:03:35] <TheButtravage> @WoolieVersus Dahilia's womb is old and dried up, you need that fresh 7 year old womb for Satan.
[4:03:44] <%hereiam407> Uhhhh
[4:03:46] <JDebss> Look up gyromancy btw
[4:03:47] <dukenux> Yeah Dahlia deserved to be burnt
[4:03:48] <+Breaknoon> uhh
[4:03:49] <andre11dr> GYROMANCY that's the story
[4:03:50] <%hereiam407> Wasn't the death by fire real?
[4:03:52] <%dds333a> eventually
[4:03:53] <BlackermanZX> oh no she did crisp up btw
[4:03:54] <+DatAsuna> deserved
[4:03:57] <slackerunchained> "Crispy Gillespie"
[4:03:57] <+Breaknoon> die in a fire
[4:03:58] <%livlinn> woolieDATTEBAYO
[4:03:59] <+BonerGirl> the cultists were all high on hallucinogenic herbs
[4:03:59] <%hereiam407> SHE BURNED
[4:04:00] <konarius> death by fire is real
[4:04:03] <dukenux> Uhh, Alessa did burn
[4:04:04] <theheen> have they talked about the guy from the wiki who thought all the games are about circumcision?
[4:04:05] <qonfiguration> The fire was real, the fact that SHE DIDN'T DIE is what's fucked up
[4:04:05] <%Shad0wTag> Woolz the fire was big real
[4:04:07] <AngryAsian5> Crispy Gillespie
[4:04:08] <+SolidusRex> No Alessa was set on fire, but not on purpose
[4:04:08] <andre11dr> She did burn
[4:04:09] <iamtheTwitchghost> LUL
[4:04:10] <NireFuster> Death by fire is super real
[4:04:11] <%Shad0wTag> She was a mega burn victim
[4:04:11] <%dds333a> @jdebss he already did
[4:04:11] <Sapphire_Breeze> Crispy Gillespie
[4:04:12] <28moogles> she was burned in the ritual and kept alive and burned for seven years
[4:04:12] <horriblegoatdemon> No she did light a fire in the house and Alessa was burned
[4:04:14] <Arqartur0> @WoolieVersus UnBirth Michael Jakcson, ReBirth Eazy E
[4:04:14] <DrkJP520> drugs tho
[4:04:15] <%Prevot> LUL
[4:04:18] <bosssbatttle> LUL
[4:04:19] <TheButtravage> @WoolieVersus Nah Woolie, the fire is real,  Alessa was burnt and kept alive.
[4:04:25] <peachy996> She did get burned but they kept experimenting on her
[4:04:26] <%livlinn> Well, gotta get to Origins
[4:04:27] <+Breaknoon> Alessa was the child Lisa was caring for that wouldnt die
[4:04:29] <slackerunchained> "Kentucky-Fried Gillespie!"
[4:04:34] <+Jiggisnipe> did Alessa actually die from the fire or was she horribly burned and remained alive
[4:04:34] <%hereiam407> @WoolieVersus She was kept in the hospital as a burned crisp, the super powers kept her alive
[4:04:38] <Sapphire_Breeze> DLC lore
[4:04:40] <majindusto> Gyromany  saveed ya during  the final  fight against  the Incubus
[4:04:41] <AngryAsian5> LORE
[4:04:41] <dukenux> @Jiggisnipe the latter
[4:04:47] <%livlinn> woolieLORE
[4:04:49] <+Breaknoon> Origins is trash because it turns Alessa into le evil child
[4:04:53] <+Jiggisnipe> that's what I figured
[4:04:53] <majindusto> *Gyromancy
[4:04:56] <qonfiguration> And that's why Lisa was so fucked up, the patient didn't die and she had to take care of her
[4:05:00] <drunken_lemur> Wait, so what is Woolie doing on Thursday?
[4:05:01] <+gpallas> MML is great
[4:05:02] <linSP> solomon deez
[4:05:02] <peachy996> This is what I mean about SH1, it could have explained its plot a little bit better
[4:05:03] <BlackermanZX> what a great game
[4:05:07] <Slim_Lipid> megaman lp monkaS
[4:05:07] <leomuratore> It's a good time
[4:05:14] <miucsa51> how about Omgeboost
[4:05:16] <BlackermanZX> the visals still hold up
[4:05:17] <@Menitta> Nice. I'm only getting around to Legends now and its great so thats why I asked lol
[4:05:18] <peachy996> Maybe have had a little more memos
[4:05:18] <bigshedman> @drunken_lemur Don't worry about it Kappa
[4:05:19] <prime_name> Legends music is top tier
[4:05:20] <DrkJP520> you might like a little game called metal gear solid
[4:05:22] <+gpallas> @drunken_lemur "We'll figure it out"
[4:05:27] <qonfiguration> They're real slow and they're covered in a miasma of sadness
[4:05:28] <+DatAsuna> rip legends 3
[4:05:29] <Alt_Tab_streams> Have you ever played the Z and ZX games? Big recommend for ZXA
[4:05:32] <+BonerGirl> MML1 is like a 3 hour game
[4:05:33] <%hereiam407> @DrkJP520 Sounds a little too indie
[4:05:37] <leomuratore> Some things are janky for current standards
[4:05:38] <+TheNihilistEnthusiast> there is a lot of grinding from what I remember of legends
[4:05:43] <qonfiguration> Yeeah
[4:05:45] <majindusto> Legends 3 :(
[4:05:47] <@Menitta> I hear thats just a minigame collection
[4:05:48] <drunken_lemur> Because no one can buy it!
[4:05:48] <TheButtravage> Bone you say?
[4:05:49] <BlackermanZX> Missadventures is really underrated
[4:05:54] <%dds333a> Alessa was alive, and they tortured her further
[4:05:58] <@Solidus_113> If you want some quick and fun games to play as filler to FF6 and Elden Ring I can recommend Hat in Time
[4:05:59] <%robosqueeb> capcom did legends fans dirty
[4:06:00] <majindusto> Tron Bonne is Fantastic
[4:06:00] <@Menitta> its on PSN for Vita and PS3
[4:06:23] <peachy996> I wouldn't begrudge you if you didn't remember it's been what 10 years?
[4:06:23] <NireFuster> Ehhh Shattered Memories isn't canon to SH1
[4:06:25] <+Breaknoon> The guy who did Diesel's voice in MML1 got arrested for BAD stuff
[4:06:26] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:06:27] <%dds333a> they lp'd it too
[4:06:28] <+DatAsuna> like 10 years ago
[4:06:29] <NireFuster> It's more of an alternative scenario
[4:06:31] <DracaenaLeaf> 2006 I think
[4:06:34] <leomuratore> 10 years+ ago?
[4:06:35] <DracaenaLeaf> or 2007
[4:06:38] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> 15 years ago
[4:06:39] <28moogles> Game came out in 2009
[4:06:41] <horriblegoatdemon> Shattered Memories is a better concept than a game I think
[4:06:42] <%dds333a> '09
[4:06:44] <theheen> it has PSYCHOLOGY in it
[4:06:53] <+DatAsuna> 15 years then
[4:06:57] <qonfiguration> The thing they did with the phone was cool
[4:07:00] <+gpallas> It came out in 2004, along with Dark Souls
[4:07:00] <NireFuster> @horriblegoatdemon It was originally gonna be completely different
[4:07:01] <%dds333a> '06 is definitely not right LUL
[4:07:04] <%MelBrooksKA> I thought Woolie was in the Shattered Memory LP on the old channel?
[4:07:05] <+BonerGirl> I love my daddy
[4:07:11] <%dds333a> I LOVE MY DADDY
[4:07:14] <%cobalt_phoenix_> sounds like those memories are shattered Kappa
[4:07:15] <NireFuster> but because it was for the wii they had to change stuff
[4:07:17] <theheen> I love my daddy
[4:07:17] <qonfiguration> Shake that can, woolie! Put your wiimote next to your ear!
[4:07:18] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> I LOVE M DADDY
[4:07:22] <TheButtravage> Do you remember the running because there is a lot of running.
[4:07:25] <+DatAsuna> "I love my punch daddy"
[4:07:25] <peachy996> @MelBrooksKA No that's Pat, Matt and Liam. It's a good lp
[4:07:26] <Grim1952> Kinky
[4:07:27] <%dds333a> And run A LOT
[4:07:33] <leomuratore> Really?!
[4:07:34] <+Breaknoon> it's more annoying than scary after awhile
[4:07:36] <+Bogart4321> that new shave
[4:07:43] <slackerunchained> OYu can momentarily battle off monsters, but it wont stick
[4:07:56] <SainEdge> yeah, you could use flares to shield yourself for o ahort time but that was it
[4:08:00] <+Breaknoon> it's also rated T because ice and snow instead of blood and rust
[4:08:01] <peachy996> Take a personal day, thursday. Treat yo self
[4:08:14] <Eger007> have you tried Thronebreaker?
[4:08:19] <TheButtravage> Which one is Mortal Shell?  Is that the shooty souls like?
[4:08:31] <%dds333a> no shoot, but yeah
[4:08:41] <MasterCosmic> no news on ff6 pr release?
[4:08:48] <%dds333a> you get HARD
[4:08:53] <@Menitta> @TheButtravage Mortal Shell is the one where you become a statue. The shooty one is Remnant of the Ashes
[4:08:53] <+Jiggisnipe> @TheButtravage the one with the harden mechanic
[4:08:56] <SainEdge> mortal shell is like 12-15 hours long, if i remember correctly
[4:08:58] <%Prevot> the not so great souls
[4:08:59] <captain_elsewhere> damnit i forgot the shooty soils name
[4:09:04] <andre11dr> When does FF6 come out?
[4:09:05] <+TheNihilistEnthusiast> sounds like Omikron
[4:09:06] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[4:09:08] <%dds333a> LUL LUL
[4:09:08] <leomuratore> @thebuttravage This one would be Remnant from the ashes
[4:09:19] <@Menitta> Sorry Remnant FROM the Ashes
[4:09:21] <TheButtravage> @Menitta Ah, thanks Remnant was the one I thought of.
[4:09:22] <konarius> You can get a couple of hours out of Born From A Wish dlc of Silent Hill 2, it is pretty much detached from rest of the game.

[4:10:06] <peachy996> You're not suggesting they do Born From A Wish first are you?

[4:10:23] <@Solidus_113> you only get swallowed by the abyss if you take off the ring in the middle of the fight, it's weird
[4:10:34] <konarius> for maximum confusion about who she really is, yes I do :P
[4:10:36] <NireFuster> They don't even know ig they're gonna do SH2 or 3 yet, let them rest a bit LUL
