[0:05:33] <cherrycottontail> Woolie simultaneously talks too much and not enough.
[0:05:37] <DatAsuna> that was kiami 2 i think
[0:05:44] <Brandon__Brando> that thread was way too negative idk where that came from
[0:05:44] <%cherryceecee> an enigma
[0:05:45] <Man_in_the_Red> @datasuna yakuza 0 had outrun and Space harrier
[0:05:46] <DatAsuna> 0 would be 80s games

[0:06:27] <DatAsuna> woolie talking and overthinking is the brand
[0:06:30] <%gatorafan> Woolie should talk more about the thing I like and less about the thing I don't like Kappa
[0:06:34] <+HitchhikingThrough> It's the best
[0:06:35] <+JustToWatch> The Woolie show has to much Woolie, but also not enough scenes with Woolie
[0:06:37] <+a_c_chirns> shooting the shit is exactly why I listen to the podcast this is great
[0:06:46] <%CaptainPileDriver> also, anyone see the live action tom and jerry shit that just got posted

[0:08:47] <%TitaniumDragoonNeo> @cherrycottontail I want images of Pat in a Dagobah Yoda sack riding Full Plate Armor Woolie.
[0:08:51] <+JustToWatch> Print out the Washington Post article that says to drop your shield and pin it on the wall
[0:09:01] <+hoenhime344> steal pats
[0:09:01] <%bread_assassin> Didn't Pat get more than one PS5 to sell to Woolie?
[0:09:03] <%RadDude6969> Yakuza Zero PogChamp
[0:09:12] <+Rolandknight> pat gave his other ps5 to someone else
[0:09:14] <%CaptainPileDriver> yakuza 0 is amazing, and kiwami 1 is a good remaster but fuck those final boss fights, kiwami 2 is fucking amazing.
[0:09:17] <@Solidus_113> I should NG+ Zero as a refresher
[0:09:17] <@Menitta> Yakuza would be good to start after Sentinels
[0:09:19] <Prevot> best yakuza game
[0:09:21] <fuji_92> nah long thing all the way
[0:09:25] <%gatorafan> Jacuzzi is a looooooooooong thing
[0:09:27] <Brandon__Brando> you cant play all the yakuza in one go like a game a year
[0:09:31] <alphonseisbest> Pat sold his ps5 to Susi
[0:09:34] <+PunJ0hn> @bread_assassin he sold it to thespherehunter
[0:09:36] <+PunJ0hn> I think
[0:09:39] <DatAsuna> kiwami is kinda dragged down by the majima anywhere system demanding grinding
[0:09:42] <+neoexogene> Yakuza is the WORTHIEST franchise to get into honestly, I can’t believe how hooked I got when I expected it to be just a good game

[0:13:29] <%Javaa01> Microsoft did this to themselves, and this is what they deserve
[0:13:37] <@Menitta> You already have a fridge
[0:13:38] <dundunsun> Popped an xbone

[0:13:51] <+neoexogene> @thepictotwitch MGS Peace Walker if you want even more with the L o v e B o x
[0:13:51] <%Javaa01> It's a slightly better Xbone pad with USB-C
[0:13:52] <Solidnick18> it is
[0:13:53] <this_guy_115> sexbox more like SUX box ha goteem
[0:13:54] <%CaptainPileDriver> do you smoke into your sexbox @WoolieVersus
[0:13:55] <Brandon__Brando> it looks small
[0:13:56] <+JustToWatch> it plays Asura's Wrath really well though
[0:13:56] <@Menitta> the Dualsense is amazing. New favorite controller
[0:13:57] <Man_in_the_Red> i shall call my PC the Windows Box
[0:13:59] <+HitchhikingThrough> That seems to be an Xbox Controller
[0:14:01] <zeif00> XSex style techs start now
[0:14:01] <+hoenhime344> no games
[0:14:09] <%emperordread> ENCHANCE
[0:14:11] <+McSoliace> its a slightly better bonex controller
[0:14:12] <thepictotwitch> @neoexogene Youre right !!
[0:14:19] <$RyTYoung> PogChamp
[0:14:20] <+HitchhikingThrough> Yup, that's an xbox
[0:14:21] <this_guy_115> ENHANCE VIDEO
[0:14:22] <+kinmarik> is the dpad still made to make blisters
[0:14:24] <%Juriasu> they added a button PogChamp
[0:14:26] <%CaptainPileDriver> remember chat, NO SMOKING INTO YOUR SEXBOX
[0:14:28] <Arisato_II> the SEXTROLLER
[0:14:29] <+HitchhikingThrough> How's that DPAD?
[0:14:30] <Solidnick18> i could have got the dualsense don't know what to use it on
[0:14:37] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus how are you gonna play more Dreamcast games, since the XSeX doesn't have HDMI In like the XBone does
[0:14:37] <andre11dr> I would have interest in it ,but i already have a better X Box,my PC
[0:14:38] <%Lion_kun> they didn't change the controller
[0:14:38] <%Javaa01> USB-C tho
[0:14:39] <+HitchhikingThrough> A L M O S T
[0:14:40] <Solidnick18> LUL
[0:14:42] <@Menitta> The Dpad looks better on the Xbone
[0:14:42] <+jiggy_snipe> dpad seems different
[0:14:42] <%Livelinne> ・＿・
[0:14:43] <+cvp5127> LUL
[0:14:44] <this_guy_115> SeXbox has a D- pad Kappa
[0:14:45] <Man_in_the_Red> @kinmarik they made it a concave disco ball
[0:14:45] <Prevot> at least one console still has color coded buttons FeelsBadMan
[0:14:49] <%Lion_kun> they barely bothered
[0:14:53] <+jiggy_snipe> oh ok
[0:14:55] <%Lion_kun> haptic feedback is effort, that's pathetic
[0:14:56] <+neoexogene> Is the D-Pad still terrible ?
[0:14:57] <%gatorafan> but can you smoke after your boxsex?
[0:14:59] <@Menitta> kiiiinda its different
[0:15:03] <andre11dr> PS 5 at least has exclusives that i want
[0:15:06] <+jiggy_snipe> so it's an elite with an extra button
[0:15:07] <Man_in_the_Red> or am i thinking of that Elite controller
[0:15:08] <%Terrarp> Remember, don't blow the Sexbox
[0:15:13] <AnneSQF> dont fix what aint broken?
[0:15:13] <andrewofbob> The DPads are different enough to fuck me up on Soul Calibur again
[0:15:31] <dots4eyes> If it's connected to the SeXbox...does it become a SeXcontroller?
[0:15:34] <Iwashi94> is the dpad still shit for fighting games?
[0:15:39] <LiquidBinge> Just go back to the 360 controller tbh
[0:15:47] <+johnny_gogo> makes fighting game inputs way harder
[0:15:49] <$RyTYoung> LUL LUL LUL
[0:15:54] <+McSoliace> isn't it technically not circular
[0:15:55] <Man_in_the_Red> DPad is still the best way to play fighters, yes
[0:16:01] <andrewofbob> 360 is where the DPad started bad
[0:16:15] <%Druuplays_> Woolie prefers the cross
[0:16:19] <Man_in_the_Red> except the 360 one, fuck that thing
[0:16:24] <+neoexogene> Oh god please no
[0:16:40] <+johnny_gogo> D pads like that make dante impossible
[0:16:44] <+neoexogene> This input on a 360 pad was a nightmare
[0:16:45] <Zayasu> i never liked how the buttons feel on xbox controllers
[0:16:46] <andrewofbob> Summon suffering can/could be short circuited with a 1080
[0:16:50] <@Menitta> The Elite 2 is nice
[0:16:53] <%dreadedcthulhu> why does literally nobody use gates for control sticks any more
[0:17:01] <SomersaultJustice> FOR THE FUTURE
[0:17:02] <alphalejandro> what controller is that? Switch Pro?
[0:17:13] <@Solidus_113> it's fast though
[0:17:18] <alphalejandro> XBOX series X?
[0:17:18] <@Menitta> Why the fuck did they keep the same UI
[0:17:23] <@Menitta> That UI is atrocious
[0:17:25] <+neoexogene> @johnny_gogo This x1000, DMC 4 Dante was terrible to play with on a 360 pad
[0:17:28] <%ExpressNode> The bad thing is that the cable doesn't have a light at the end anymore telling you a full charge
[0:17:28] <%wibbwobbler> micro, soft
[0:17:46] <%gatorafan> Everything must be Win10
[0:17:54] <andre11dr> They bolt kinda just did the same UI again
[0:17:56] <@Menitta> Its not even Win 10
[0:18:01] <@Menitta> that UI is still Win 8
[0:18:08] <%gatorafan> pfffft
[0:18:15] <+HitchhikingThrough> honestly good
[0:18:15] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts

[0:18:18] <anarchistPastry> bwaaaaaa
[0:18:19] <@Menitta> Yeyeye
[0:18:19] <Brandon__Brando> the 360 one was strong
[0:18:20] <+McSoliace> apparently the xsex is like 10% stronger than the ps5

[0:18:28] <+neoexogene> Wait they didn’t change the UI ?
[0:18:30] <+cvp5127> those triggers

[0:18:46] <ginjais> that Twitch bias
[0:18:48] <+HitchhikingThrough> @WoolieVersus MONEY ON THE TABLE: SHOULD I BUY THIS AS MY NEW CONTROLLER
[0:18:50] <+neoexogene> YOOO ?
[0:18:51] <Solidnick18> how's that feel

[0:18:55] <%CaptainPileDriver> he lurks in stream
[0:18:59] <%CaptainPileDriver> he just never talks
[0:19:04] <+NYCrownlessKing> very bottom button is to turn on/off microphone, speakers are above it @WoolieVersus
[0:19:04] <%gatorafan> INFLUENCER
[0:19:06] <@Menitta> Yes
[0:19:08] <@Menitta> 100%
[0:19:10] <+neoexogene> 🅱️EZOS
[0:19:10] <+HitchhikingThrough> ok
[0:19:11] <Man_in_the_Red> everything is an improvement on the fuckin DS4
[0:19:12] <%RioGascar> So are we just talking about stuff?
[0:19:13] <Solidnick18> really need the thing
[0:19:16] <+NYCrownlessKing> can it use the haptic feedback on pc? @WoolieVersus
[0:19:18] <@Solidus_113> you can't
[0:19:19] <%CaptainPileDriver> from what i've heard is a 100% yes
[0:19:20] <+cvp5127> nice weight
[0:19:24] <@Menitta> Its incredible. Vergil plays super well
[0:19:24] <%Javaa01> Terrible to service though, but yeah, nice to use
[0:19:27] <+johnny_gogo> How the D pad would you play tekken on it
[0:19:28] <+McSoliace> i heard the ps5 controller needs to be broken in
[0:19:32] <@Solidus_113> Dualsense doesn't work on PS4, but it does work on PS3
[0:19:43] <%CaptainPileDriver> no ps4 backwards compatibility for the controller
[0:19:46] <%vextalyst> @WoolieVersus How's the Dpad?
[0:19:46] <andre11dr> I heard really good things about the haptic feedback
[0:19:47] <+cvp5127> thicc
[0:19:53] <%dreadedcthulhu> I've just never been a fan of the stick setup
[0:19:53] <+neoexogene> The Dualsense is the best controller I’ve ever held, hands down
[0:19:53] <alphalejandro> Reggie LUL
[0:19:54] <+NYCrownlessKing> I know Pat hyped up the rumble to you, does it work on PC? @WoolieVersus
[0:19:57] <Solidnick18> LUL
[0:19:58] <Zayasu> so like the switch pro controller
[0:20:00] <Arisato_II> might want to clip this just for Reggie's faces
[0:20:02] <Solidnick18> oh no
[0:20:02] <%dreadedcthulhu> prefer the asymmetrical setup
[0:20:06] <thelivingglitch307> @Solidus_113 no way
[0:20:12] <%CaptainPileDriver> @Solidus_113 are you serious?
[0:20:14] <Solidnick18> it's in the controller
[0:20:17] <+HitchhikingThrough> That's a good feature
[0:20:22] <+OmegaZeroX2> @nycrownlessking Yo hmkYEA ride26Calc mom0kaMythradab
[0:20:24] <+PunJ0hn> switch pro is still my all time fav for pc gaming
[0:20:25] <%gatorafan> the POWER
[0:20:25] <TheDr0t> did the Xbox SEX X arrived yet? @woolieversus
[0:20:29] <Solidnick18> that's great
[0:20:31] <@Solidus_113> the final PS3 update made it so the console will work with generic bluetooth devices
[0:20:33] <%RioGascar> @woolieversus with you having mentioned that you love the x-wing/Tie-Fighter game have you considered playing star wars squadrons? The VR mode is absolutely incredible as i’ve geeked out having a fantasy of being in a X-wing fulfilled
[0:20:40] <Solidnick18> stop talking
[0:20:41] <%SaturnDelta> @WoolieVersus I placed an order for a build from Artesian and your code almost completely negated the shipping. It will come in tomorrow, I'm so hype
[0:20:45] <Brandon__Brando> my favorite button in multiplayer
[0:20:48] <+NYCrownlessKing> yo @OmegaZeroX2
[0:20:52] <%CaptainPileDriver> @Solidus_113 that's true. that's dumb
[0:20:54] <Solidnick18> that's great
[0:20:56] <+neoexogene> Ah yes, the Aris button
[0:20:59] <thelivingglitch307> mute all the stinky's
[0:21:04] <%BinaryFireball> even thought it's the third time I've seen people talk about the dualsense I don't mind because it's so gooood
[0:21:06] <Man_in_the_Red> its another way to get DQ'd mid match
[0:21:12] <andrewofbob> Push to STFU

[0:21:29] <Triplicat> @Man_in_the_Red not anymore yo!!!
[0:21:30] <+neoexogene> Push mic button to get parried
[0:21:31] <%dreadedcthulhu> "xbox, turn on my Playstation"
[0:21:31] <%gatorafan> the SHAME button
[0:21:37] <DatAsuna> doubt it
[0:21:47] <+arancet> @WoolieVersus theyre not supported on steam atm, maybe in future
[0:21:51] <+neoexogene> Highly doubt it
[0:21:58] <%Javaa01> Steam will see it as a generic controller, so if you want the specific stuff, you gotta wait for official Sony drivers
[0:22:03] <%RioGascar> someone will probably work on it
[0:22:04] <+NYCrownlessKing> im playing demon souls and i feel the oomph of when a giant axe swings and knocks an enemy into the air @WoolieVersus
[0:22:05] <@Solidus_113> the speakers in the controller are converting sound waves into vibrations
[0:22:12] <+neoexogene> But the haptic feedback on this controller is UNREAL
[0:22:13] <fuji_92> you can feel the graphics
[0:22:14] <Prevot> totally not gimmicky bullshit that most devs will forget in 6 months at all
[0:22:14] <Man_in_the_Red> remember HD Rumble and how quick people forgot it
[0:22:15] <andre11dr> Oh so Woolie hasn't touched DeS yet,interesting
[0:22:21] <AnneSQF> you can feel the bugsnax transform your body
[0:22:22] <Solidnick18> when we get to the lp
[0:22:35] <%dreadedcthulhu> isn't this just the HD rumble thats in the joycons
[0:22:39] <thelivingglitch307> nice
[0:22:39] <+McSoliace> i fear for the ps5 controller after a year of time
[0:22:46] <%GalacticaPhanto> @andre11dr Hard to with no ps5
[0:22:53] <%ExpressNode> Did Woolie get both a PS5 and a Series X?
[0:22:58] <@Solidus_113> no PS5
[0:22:59] <%Druuplays_> Imagine the trigger fighting back reving neros sword
[0:23:01] <@Solidus_113> couldn't find one
[0:23:02] <%CaptainPileDriver> cannot wait for the indie fighting games to come out and do some real good stuff with that
[0:23:02] <+cvp5127> only sexbox
[0:23:03] <Arisato_II> CoD Cold War has that function and depends on the weapons
[0:23:05] <%CaptainPileDriver> they do
[0:23:07] <%Javaa01> @dreadedcthulhu Sorta, but the rumble motor is differently designed
[0:23:08] <thelivingglitch307> hardware evolution has expanded past the console
[0:23:11] <+neoexogene> @dreadedcthulhu same idea but just a much better execution, like 10 times better
[0:23:15] <emeraldskrull> keep in mind if pat is saying it it's borderline fiction
[0:23:16] <%RioGascar> the work will have to be put in tho and I imagine this feature will get forgotten within a year or two
[0:23:17] <BlackermanZX> i heard this is waaaay better than the switch rumble
[0:23:19] <Klefth> I've been using the controller for about a week on PC. It gets dirty stupid easy thanks to that cool texture on the bottom :/
[0:23:26] <BlackermanZX> like its magic
[0:23:39] <%dreadedcthulhu> sounds expensive
[0:23:40] <@Menitta> the Switch's HD rumble is garbage compared to this
[0:23:47] <%jinking79> jinking79 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months! hope u enjoyed your break from streaming this passed week and hopefully ppl aren't preparing to send u their pic of their shaved pubes thanks to manscape
[0:23:56] <%Javaa01> Also the vibration motors in the Switch controllers are tiny
[0:23:59] <@Menitta> It's like the N64 Rumble Pak compared to this
[0:24:02] <+McSoliace> if it has parts that move like that in the ps5 controller it could just stop working real fast
[0:24:03] <DatAsuna> I'm wary because people talked up the switch and xbone trigger rumbles like this too
[0:24:07] <+kinmarik> I really hope they put out a black one
[0:24:08] <@Solidus_113> nobody used the XBone trigger vibration
[0:24:22] <DatAsuna> So launch day "game changing" rumble I'm skeptical on cause it's the third time people said it was amazing
[0:24:22] <@Menitta> Only Forza really used it
[0:24:45] <Klefth> It doesn't work on PS4
[0:24:48] <%Javaa01> Yeah, Xbone trigger rumble was only in first party titles
[0:24:48] <+HitchhikingThrough> Good to know
[0:24:49] <Prevot> like all cool new controller feautures it will ultimately amount to nothing
[0:24:54] <andre11dr> Why 12?
[0:24:58] <Man_in_the_Red> we will all forget it in 6 months like the Playstation Move camera
[0:25:01] <+neoexogene> I really hope the haptic feedback gets used for real because it’s legit amazing so far
[0:25:02] <@Menitta> Plus in Forza, it wasnt that good too
[0:25:08] <DatAsuna> It's just the kinda thing I'll never trust second hand info on
[0:25:09] <@Menitta> And same with the Switch
[0:25:22] <Arisato_II> the Banana Controller
[0:25:22] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[0:25:32] <%CaptainPileDriver> a controller with like 20+ buttons was tried
[0:25:35] <+Ancopro> i dunno i think we could use another shot at the n64 controller Kappa
[0:25:38] <Triplicat> The next evolution is controlling things with your brain.
[0:25:39] <DatAsuna> go back to the glove
[0:25:41] <Triplicat> directly
[0:25:51] <%RioGascar> @woolieversus im curious. You’ve had your quest for awhile now. Have you gotten much play or has it kinda been sitting?
[0:25:51] <andre11dr> GTFO Paul Marketing
[0:25:53] <Darren716> Bring back the trident!
[0:25:59] <%afronooch> i think were actually ready for a power glove tho
[0:26:03] <glass_marcus> but what if there were 4 handles?

[0:26:16] <Cynical_Canadian> That's fine with me, I prefer the standard controllers
[0:26:17] <%dreadedcthulhu> controllers need more paddles
[0:26:18] <%CaptainPileDriver> yeah but they work
[0:26:28] <%CaptainPileDriver> unlike the boomerang
[0:26:36] <Man_in_the_Red> if we reach a point brain control becomes a thing we might as well skip the middleman and make videogames into a dopamine injection into the spinal cord attached to a coin slot
[0:26:37] <%dreadedcthulhu> I support upping the number of paddles we encounter in our lives
[0:26:37] <Arisato_II> Ohno

[0:34:29] <andre11dr> Wat was the old LP like 65?
[0:34:30] <JetpackMcQuack> 8 parts
[0:34:30] <CalderGaming> Yakuza 1's writing is pretty dated
[0:34:31] <@Menitta> Yakuza is a game with SO MUCH good content
[0:34:34] <@Solidus_113> 57 hours baybeeeeeeee
[0:34:35] <%Javaa01> It depends on your tolerance really, as long as you don't go into the Shogi/Mahjong completion hole
[0:34:36] <Solidnick18> 0
[0:34:36] <AnneSQF> I'll tell you what I want, what I really really want
[0:34:36] <%RioGascar> *does not want mahjong to show up at all
[0:34:38] <+McSoliace> 200 coward ill watch it all
[0:34:39] <alphalejandro> no Virtua Fighter 5 tho, since the game take place in the past
[0:34:43] <%karldeck> 100 at least
[0:34:43] <@Solidus_113> so about 80 parts
[0:34:44] <%gatorafan> THE WONDERFUL 101
[0:34:45] <lostcolors> aim for the year of yakuza
[0:34:48] <%CaptainPileDriver> 3 HOURS OF MAHJONG
[0:34:49] <@Menitta> About 80 or do
[0:34:52] <@Menitta> so*
[0:34:57] <Blank9> Yakuza 0 in particular's the kind of game where it's like "oh fuck I can't wait for part 42" from the start, like bigger anticipation than Glitz Pit in TTYD.
[0:34:58] <+TheDandyGuy> 50 parts of mahjong alone
[0:35:06] <fuji_92> mahjong only LP
[0:35:09] <+kinmarik> 2000 hours in the chao garden
[0:35:11] <Cynical_Canadian> The SBFP one was 68 with 30 minute parts
[0:35:12] <bxdragon> But I like the stop and talk.
[0:35:17] <Arisato_II> 51 parts with "a little grinding off-screen"
[0:35:23] <bxdragon> Give time to process and chill.
[0:35:26] <+Superbro64> There was definitely some pissy redditors about that
[0:35:37] <@Menitta> 0 doesnt even really have grinding. Its just find Mr. Shakedown
[0:35:38] <+gag5y> howdy what we chatting abt
[0:35:38] <BlackermanZX> i'll watch it all anyways
[0:35:41] <Brandon__Brando> i like stop and talk
[0:35:42] <+TheDandyGuy> yakuza has stop and talk built in because of the cutscene and dialogue pauses
[0:35:46] <andre11dr> Luckily Yakuza 0 just keeps throwing crazy shit at you and it doesn't stop
[0:36:01] <%RioGascar> @woolieversus just know that its a mix of reading and listening. Not everything is voice in zero. Even main story stuff is sometimes just text boxs
[0:36:05] <Darren716> Yeah Pat did most of the real estate and cabaret stuff off screen so that cut a lot of time
[0:36:06] <DatAsuna> talking over cutscenes then complaining you didn't understand them became a bit of an issue for yakuza with matt
[0:36:15] <Blank9> I'm glad 0, Judgement, and LAD are all amaing intros
[0:36:15] <au_d3n> LUL
[0:36:20] <@Solidus_113> Missing the Accord dialogue in the Automata LP
[0:36:26] <andre11dr> The sidequests are as good as the main story
[0:36:31] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I didn't even do any Mr Shakedown shit in Yakuza 0.
[0:36:33] <%BallerSwagBro9k> DROP YOUR SHIELD
[0:36:36] <%CaptainPileDriver> @Solidus_113 that's a callout
[0:36:37] <@Menitta> Yeah the way side stories work are super good for content because it just shoves them in your face
[0:36:43] <%Chatterbox1991> I feel like theres a conversation to be had about the nature of transfering from Youtube to Twitch in terms of LP formatting
[0:36:44] <Arisato_II> damm, game roasting the player when
[0:36:44] <DatAsuna> Ending Y never ;n;
[0:36:46] <%Seancicle> FootYellow Straight to DVD
[0:36:47] <fuji_92> YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN
[0:36:48] <+TheDandyGuy> if you actually read dialogue you'll have a fantastic time with yakuza
[0:36:51] <DatAsuna> Tho tbf it does take some farming
[0:36:52] <alphalejandro> Baka Mitai Reggie
[0:36:56] <SomersaultJustice> I wonder if woolie will bother with the real estate or the cabaret club
[0:36:59] <%Ashenik1> You see waht I mean
[0:37:02] <+JustToWatch> 13 Sentinels definitely benefits from the stop and talk though
[0:37:02] <+HitchhikingThrough> @WoolieVersus dumb obvious suggestion: If you have 2 people, at least one person can be keeping a dedicated eye on the dialogue.
[0:37:08] <%Javaa01> Substories are marked on your map in the more recent Yakuza games, so it's hard to miss most things
[0:37:11] <%Chatterbox1991> ...unless the story is shit
[0:37:20] <fruit_pie_the_magician> 0s cutscenes are at least comparatively brief and broken up
[0:37:20] <+Superbro64> nicob has a friendly army of commentators that let him know what he missed from episode to episode
[0:37:21] <%dreadedcthulhu> mst3k riffing on cutscenes
[0:37:22] <Cynical_Canadian> I WISH a game would call people out like that
[0:37:22] <+kinmarik> that's the silent hill 2 lesson
[0:37:30] <%CaptainPileDriver> with the exception of the minecraft story mode
[0:37:33] <Prevot> IIRC matt payed fuck all attention to the plot of Yakuza 0 and kept getting confused, despite it being the simplest yakuza plot
[0:37:48] <%Ashenik1> @CaptainPileDriver Best LP Ever LUL
[0:37:48] <andre11dr> The early days were Pat was yelling over cutscenes, oh boy
[0:37:51] <+kinmarik> sometimes the game demands respect
[0:37:51] <%Seancicle> Spearfish
[0:37:52] <+Superbro64> @prevot "simplest"
[0:38:05] <Morning_Asakura> the minecraft story mode lp is still the greatest piece of media
[0:38:07] <Cynical_Canadian> @Prevot You're correct and it made the later parts harder to get through
[0:38:08] <Darren716> Chat quick question, haven't watched the 0 lp in a while, do they go over the Majima and Taiga stuff in game?
[0:38:10] <%Seancicle> 🦊
[0:38:13] <jorniev> the sonic the hedgehog protein
[0:38:16] <Darren716> Or do they expect you to play 4?
[0:38:25] <jorniev> i still cant deal
[0:38:27] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Saejima is barely mentioned in 0
[0:38:27] <%Livelinne> There will be able to get a dreadlock in Animal Crossing. Just saying.
[0:38:29] <%bread_assassin> @Darren716 Briefly
[0:38:31] <%CaptainPileDriver> you didn't pay attention to minecraft and it became a fucking second podcast
[0:38:33] <Prevot> compared to the rest of the yakuza series 0 is really easy to follow
[0:38:34] <Darren716> Hmmm
[0:38:39] <%RioGascar> @cynical_canadian The games usual call out is: alright so the plan is go to the window (first time) go to the window (second time) HEY STOP SCREWING AROUND GO TO WINDOW (3rd time)
[0:38:40] <%LionheartedRebel> @Darren716 iirc there's a brief recap of that
[0:38:41] <brian_peppers1> omg is this the yakuza stream?
[0:38:43] <fuji_92> nah for me it should've gone longer
[0:38:45] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Screw those guys
[0:38:47] <BlackermanZX> the TTYD ride was amazing
[0:38:50] <+Superbro64> @brian_peppers1 no
[0:38:50] <ullyzeez> fuck dem kids
[0:38:55] <DatAsuna> Those people have the brain goblins
[0:39:03] <Darren716> I kinda want Woolie to at least watch that scene from 4, would add a ton of context
[0:39:04] <%SomeSageAdvice> those people are the fun police
[0:39:08] <Solidnick18> just do the best you can woolie
[0:39:08] <brian_peppers1> @Superbro64 :(
[0:39:12] <dots4eyes> It's fine. I never felt any LP was too long.
[0:39:20] <andre11dr> I remember that Heavy Rain stream were Woolie just gave up on the story and just starts yelling at Pat ,it was amazing
[0:39:21] <fruit_pie_the_magician> A speedrun of 0 would probably still be like 10-15 hours if you skipped every skippable cutscene
[0:39:22] <%Terrarp> Bloodborne was slow but I loved it, you guys were discovering the game with us
[0:39:23] <+crossing_mao> We doing a podcast today? glacie20Thinking
[0:39:25] <%Chatterbox1991> Well one thing that's important to remember is to also not over think it too much
[0:39:27] <%gatorafan> I'm having fun daedra1DerpyTibs
[0:39:40] <%wibbwobbler> SeemsGood
[0:39:40] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1328635387057758213?s=19
[0:39:41] <Blank9> It's more of a saejima thing with that cutscene
[0:39:44] <dots4eyes> Longer LP = more content. I consider that a win.
[0:39:52] <+Superbro64> @prevot dead souls Kappa
[0:39:58] <+TheDandyGuy> your personal enjoyment of the game should come before anything else
[0:40:12] <+RowenCleric> hell only the truly loyal fans are part of the 10,000 Tokyo Mirage Session viewers
[0:40:14] <Darren716> Still it's pretty important to show why Majima is where he's at at the begining of 0
[0:40:14] <%RioGascar> @woolieversus because you will eventually get to this. Do you have any plan for Half-Life: Alyx? I would say you most definitely want to play half life 2, ep1 and ep2 prior. whenever you get to it that is
[0:40:16] <%Terrarp> If you enjoy the Game we enjoy the LP
[0:40:21] <%Seancicle> a
[0:40:25] <@akuda_bar> akuda_bar subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months! always appreciate you sharing your philosophy on this stuff. it can be frustrating to figure out "how to stream," but that's also what makes it interesting
[0:40:42] <fruit_pie_the_magician> If I like the game, I'll watch you play it no matter how many parts it is. Particularly if it's something hilarious like Yakuza 0
[0:40:52] <DatAsuna> Intermission time can be chill
[0:40:53] <@Solidus_113> people will drop off every episode
[0:40:56] <jorniev> WHENS THE GUILTY GEAR VID
[0:40:56] <BlackermanZX> No time is wasted if its fun
[0:41:00] <%Malik1002> whats going on here
[0:41:01] <mark1247> Any future LP that are on PS4 , will they be played on PS5 now? @woolieversus
[0:41:11] <DatAsuna> I remember deadly premonition LP got way worse when they starting fastforwarding the overworld tbh
[0:41:12] <%Malik1002> are they about to play or are we just chilling
[0:41:12] <%Javaa01> Yakuza gives you a lot to work with with shenanigans
[0:41:13] <+Superbro64> cough #fe13000 cough
[0:41:13] <WaifusSansFrontieres> it also depends on the game, stuff like yakuza from audience perspective is all about seeing you see the whacky shit
[0:41:23] <DatAsuna> Half the best convos came off of the york driving convos

[0:41:47] <Solidnick18> yakuza will hand hold you abit
[0:41:47] <Cynical_Canadian> @Solidus_113 That's the real issue, viewer retention
[0:41:53] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Yakuza 7 however seems to have like five hours of cutscenes as an intro
[0:41:53] <%RioGascar> i will admit longer lps or RPGs I generally start and drop out early BUT as its finishing up I usually blitz through the youtube uploads to catch up (kotor 1, kotor 2, ttyd for example)
[0:41:54] <chemy_chems> Was not expecting talk of opportunity costs in this mario lp. LoL
[0:42:00] <+RowenCleric> @Superbro64 awww yea
[0:42:04] <@akuda_bar> i'm not, i just think it's interesting lol

[0:43:04] <@akuda_bar> it's neat
[0:43:09] <+Mendin> Did I tune into a live episode of Woolie Will Figure It Out?
[0:43:11] <%RioGascar> the funny thing is you dont make it seem like that
[0:43:15] <jorniev> WOOLIE has gotten good trough PERSEVERANCE
[0:43:16] <+RowenCleric> @WoolieVersus honestly would never guess that Woolie, you seem super natural
[0:43:19] <Cynical_Canadian> Will Woolie ever become Might Guy and 8th Gate streaming? Or will he be like Rock Lee and always lose?
[0:43:20] <Equirah> Dynamic Woolie!
[0:43:24] <%RioGascar> you just kinda seem like the entertainment woolie is effortless
[0:43:27] <%wibbwobbler> very nice

[0:43:49] <%Javaa01> Fear 1 is the good one, the rest are crap
[0:43:49] <%dreadedcthulhu> fear water SUCC
[0:43:52] <fruit_pie_the_magician> F.E.A.R 1 is fucking great
[0:43:53] <Arisato_II> Fear 3 with Reggie when
[0:44:00] <DatAsuna> f3ar was the co-op one
[0:44:05] <%Javaa01> F3AR is really bad
[0:44:06] <jorniev> FEAR 3 IS THE WORST
[0:44:07] <fruit_pie_the_magician> 2 and 3 are not great
[0:44:11] <+TheDandyGuy> oh man Fear is fucking great actually
[0:44:11] <Blank9> oh yeah, fear 1 is great
[0:44:14] <%Seancicle> SingsMic I need a new fan KPOPfan
[0:44:15] <Cynical_Canadian> I still can't pronounce F3AR without saying it the way Pat does
[0:44:21] <@Solidus_113> it's got bullet time
[0:44:24] <andre11dr> 3 is pretty wack
[0:44:25] <+TheDandyGuy> the first one is good the others are junk
[0:44:25] <+Superbro64> Fear is a good game, one of the worst video game trilogies. Get more bad with every game
[0:44:29] <+Mendin> Paper Mario was a golden LP
[0:44:31] <%dreadedcthulhu> a friend of mine just finished streaming the first one
[0:44:43] <jorniev> i want to play the fear based game that one guy is trying to make
[0:45:00] <jorniev> HOW MUCH MONE
[0:45:06] <+pectusumbra> Yes that's card games
[0:45:26] <+HitchhikingThrough> The one thing I would legitimately love out of this channel would be edited highlights of the Get Into Fighting Game streams. I want to like them, but I can't catch 3-4 hours of uncut footage.
[0:45:29] <andre11dr> That sucks
[0:45:33] <%Seancicle> I understand
[0:45:41] <fuji_92> a card game with a changing meta for u to buy more cards? nah that's impossible Kappa
[0:45:51] <andre11dr> I hate those type of nerfs
[0:45:56] <Daxalog> "I dont go meta diving" he says while playing purple eye
[0:46:00] <jorniev> @HitchhikingThrough THIS!
[0:46:11] <andre11dr> At least leave it a fair, don't make it trash

[0:51:07] <%Javaa01> Yeah but for HDMI, it doesn't matter at all, cause it's a digital signal, either you get a signal, or you don't
[0:51:15] <linSP> The gold makes it richer
[0:51:16] <+HitchhikingThrough> BUY A 50 FOOT CABLE YOU FUCK

[0:58:28] <Brandon__Brando> if mixer just stayed alive for a couple more months
[0:58:30] <anarchistPastry> i thought it was a copyright bot
[0:58:30] <%Chatterbox1991> @WoolieVersus Pat talked about a dude who got flagged by the sound of gunfire via some Al-Jazera news footage of a gun battle in the Middle East
[0:58:31] <theotrainwreck> All cops are copyright trolls
[0:58:34] <+McSoliace> twitch keeps archives of this shit so they can likely fuck you even with deleting
[0:58:36] <@Commando_Joe> @anarchistPastry not always, they have DMCA bounty hunters
[0:58:37] <%cobalt_phoenix_> DMCA law and the way it's enforced are super fucked
[0:58:43] <haitakaa> quick someone copyright farts
[0:58:47] <%RioGascar> Copyright is a mess in general
[0:58:49] <@Menitta> its the EXACT same thing that happened with Youtube 7 years ago
[0:58:49] <%Ashenik1> DONT WHISTLE OR HUM GUYS!!!
[0:58:52] <%Xero_J> It's the sort of thing where that lady sued McDonald's over coffee
[0:58:59] <linSP> vinny vinesauce getting dmca’d over cricket noises
[0:59:00] <+Superbro64> Max actually is subbed to the dmca bot system, and the noises your sub donations make can get you dmca'd @woolieversus
[0:59:01] <DatAsuna> TheFatRat case was wildly blatant
[0:59:08] <pjbuster> yea Dmca is pretty ass
[0:59:09] <WaifusSansFrontieres> @WoolieVersus are you safe if you get a review code for the explicit purpose of streaming?
[0:59:11] <andre11dr> This is were we really see that DMCA is not about protecting artists, it's about just making money, We knew about this when artists get DMCA ON THEIR OWN SHIT
[0:59:12] <RayCSmooth> No Fun Allowed
[0:59:18] <%LionheartedRebel> Yeah, copyright laws are outdated and so goddamn convoluted (former Broadcast/Digital graduate here)

[0:59:48] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> That's a good way to get Nintendo lawyers on you
[0:59:51] <+Dives__> DMCA was bad law

[0:59:57] <bigshedman> @Xero_J You mean the woman who sued McDonalds for serving coffee at dangerously hot levels and the coffee weakened the styrofoam cup to the point it easily disintegrated in a slight grip?

[1:01:43] <DatAsuna> You can also just not have a contact address and youtube will tell them to contact the claimant directly
[1:01:46] <+a_c_chirns> repeal DMCA or at least make it only apply to USA jfc
[1:01:50] <WaifusSansFrontieres> False DMCA is safe on block
[1:01:50] <bigshedman> Here's a fun fact: filing a false DMCA-claim is perjury, a state offence in the US. But good luck sueing something like a record company or even proving intent in court LUL
[1:01:51] <%RioGascar> it both sounds like its something that is public and should not be public
[1:01:52] <linSP> there’s a guy on YouTube who makes dark souls videos who claims his own videos
[1:01:54] <BlackermanZX> DMCA is fucking disgusting
[1:01:58] <%gatorafan> X Factor
[1:02:13] <+Superbro64> reminder that dmca will always exist, because lobbying is legal bribery
[1:02:15] <%RioGascar> I should not just be able to make a dmca claim without going through some work to like copyright things i make

[1:03:57] <%vextalyst> NEXT BIT
[1:03:58] <WaifusSansFrontieres> @WoolieVersus theres several guides on youtube to avoid false DMCA, the trick is to sign up with a label, copyright your videos as music you own and then copystrike yourself and steal your own revenue this actually works
[1:04:00] <%wibbwobbler> SHAVE THAT IS
[1:04:06] <OldManDeckardCain> send them to reggie, probably another kink will awaken

[1:11:53] <%RioGascar> @woolieversus have you considered Max Payne??? 1 & 2 are a bit old school design (mainly difficult as fuck at time) but the storys are great and the visual style is awesome
[1:11:58] <Zayasu> like max?
[1:11:59] <%Asuterisuku> Take a couple of key matches from each stream?
[1:12:02] <+McSoliace> it would have to be just blow ups
[1:12:03] <%0rond> 20-30 is probably a better idea
[1:12:04] <+Jaysky> D M C 2
[1:12:04] <%gatorafan> 2 minutes GIFG
[1:12:10] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Im game but thats alot of work
[1:12:12] <$RyTYoung> @riogascar Yes to this! 3 is also really good
[1:12:12] <DatAsuna> it depends on what you're saying in the full stream
[1:12:13] <andre11dr> So like a Max video
[1:12:13] <%Ashenik1> @WoolieVersus You know the Thronebraeker: The Witcher Tales exists? around 25 hrs.
[1:12:13] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> What would you cut it down to, is the question?
[1:12:17] <theotrainwreck> Shout out to solidus
[1:12:19] <DDDorsett> Save that for a "Best of 2020" video
[1:12:19] <MKII> perfectly cut get into fighting games
[1:12:40] <%Asuterisuku> @Ashenik1 You mean Gwent Campaign mode?
[1:12:40] <chemy_chems> They out here suggesting Quibi content for you to make.
[1:12:42] <%RioGascar> Speaking of @solidus_113 how the pc? No GPU still?
[1:12:48] <@Solidus_113> still no gpu
[1:12:54] <%RioGascar> Rip
[1:12:58] <DatAsuna> F
[1:12:58] <%0rond> edited to 30 minutes like a standard LP size would be nice
[1:13:02] <DatAsuna> What ya aiming for?
[1:13:06] <Brandon__Brando> phaaat
[1:13:17] <andre11dr> Well, i watch 5 hours streams, im not the person to ask here
[1:13:22] <+TheDandyGuy> I'd watch 90 minutes easy, just name it "special" or something
[1:13:29] <BlackermanZX> I like my videos THICC and LONG doodNuts
[1:13:52] <%Ashenik1> @Asuterisuku Yeah! Its great!
[1:14:07] <theotrainwreck> Solidus get a 2080 for your editing setup you can make it a tax writeoff lol
[1:14:16] <%RioGascar> I mostly put the fighting game stuff on background as i don’t understand a lot of shit going on
[1:14:17] <ManJazzSSBM> @woolieversus are you guys gonna do Windjammers on the stream before number 2 comes out?
[1:14:20] <Solidnick18> i like the half hour episodes
[1:14:24] <DatAsuna> I just think in a 10/20 min format people expect something more succint and scripted, and stream highlights are just gonna be weird to try and reshape into that
[1:14:34] <+HitchhikingThrough> I don't think you need full matches though
[1:14:34] <+mechslayer71> Has Wookiee gotten his new PC yet?
[1:14:40] <+mechslayer71> Woolie*
[1:14:48] <Solidnick18> lol
[1:14:53] <%0rond> I think there was a point of realization around the time all LPs started to be streamed, where it was like "it needs to be an hour, otherwise there's too much footage and the backlog becomes too big"
[1:14:53] <theotrainwreck> chewie
[1:14:53] <@akuda_bar> chat never stop
