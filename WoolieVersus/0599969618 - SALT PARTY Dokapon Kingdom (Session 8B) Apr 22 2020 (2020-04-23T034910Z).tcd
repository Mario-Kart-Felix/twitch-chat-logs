[0:11:48] <%kingkeldeo31> But 2 deathblocks tho
[0:11:49] <irfan_> attack???

Use items/magi because they can easily stolen by another player’s items/magic. Even stats can be taken away. The only thing that stays is class mastery.

[1:23:15] <+MrAtheGreat> Bye
[1:23:17] <Pyrenity> that's because it is not..
[1:23:19] <+Reverend_Roscoe> WRONG SPELL
[1:23:20] <crimsonsaens> Wabbit is an item
[1:23:24] <%SuperKirby24> NAILED IT
[1:23:28] <BearSawed> I think he knows
[1:23:29] <topendbuzza> shhh chat
[1:23:30] <Shishi1205> Now you need to purse cutter
[1:23:33] <%Th3SmartAlec> He can just go to the temple
[1:23:35] <%Riottrio> get closer to wabbit
[1:23:37] <%emperordread> Blood Pool gonna get a whole lotta blood from inevitable conflict
[1:23:38] <%kingkeldeo31> You gave him a free town
[1:23:41] <+hoenhime344> no but reggie has a purse cutter
[1:23:41] <Shishi1205> MOVE INTO CUT COMBO
[1:23:46] <Daba_mk2> i see the logic
[1:23:47] <LeaIsChill> Chat backseating every little play is so LUL
[1:23:49] <%xcompleasedad> USE VANISH FOOL
[1:23:51] <+hoenhime344> so reggie is going to purse cut minhs purse cutter
[1:23:51] <+mrcooperblack> You let reggie keep a purse cutter so oof
[1:23:53] <RurouniGeo> why not kill him and take it from it minh? See Minh doesn't know what he's doing lol
[1:23:54] <BearSawed> I think hes gonna get close to dokapon then purse cut
[1:23:55] <Shishi1205> MAgic
[1:24:00] <+gutlesscoward> he can't use vanish since he's on a town and is fighting now
[1:24:01] <%Th3SmartAlec> @LeaIsChill We can't help it
[1:24:02] <%Riottrio> @LeaIsChill yeah, but its why we're here!
[1:24:04] <%lotharrio> I get the logic, but Reggie can purse cut, too.
[1:24:04] <%Kriss1827> Reggie has vanish
[1:24:06] <DaBigVitus> @LeaIsChill what else is there to do?
[1:24:07] <SoupBowler> What if Reggie dies somehow and drops the Wabbit
[1:24:08] <Klefth> Why isn't everyone hunting Minh down right about now? LUL
[1:24:20] <Shishi1205> Woolie dodging the wanted week like a boss
[1:24:23] <%Jetzord> Where's the assassin?
[1:24:28] <%lotharrio> @Klefth Minh's too much of an unstoppable speed master.
[1:24:29] <Maleicus> reggie can just give up and not be purse cutter'd then vanish
[1:24:29] <Daba_mk2> thats the question
[1:24:30] <crimsonsaens> Sell Angel Wings
[1:24:32] <%blastazoid00> I though everyone is hunting woolie
[1:24:32] <BearSawed> Because reggie wants to turn in, and woolie is very undergeared
[1:24:32] <%Riottrio> I feel like Woolie's bounty has been forgotton because wabbit
[1:24:33] <dastmwolf> Minhs style is "slow the game down to a crawl"
[1:24:37] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Klefth He'll instantly kick their asses, assuming he doesn't Squall them on their way there
[1:24:39] <+dollarstored> i dont need a potion...has like 10 hp left
[1:24:39] <%Superdandy96> Minh needs to land on a yellow space
[1:24:43] <+jorgamund> Elixir is dirt cheap
[1:24:49] <+hoenhime344> i want to see the wing quest
[1:24:50] <Shishi1205> he leveled up @dollarstored
[1:25:04] <C4m3r0n0409> MINH SHOULD KILL REGGIE

[1:33:10] <Reizie_Etherealm> I feel like in this game you shouldn't form a plan, but rather you should just set a goal cause things shift and change so randomly

[1:38:34] <%Th3SmartAlec> Ring of Speed LUL
[1:38:34] <Shishi1205> 50 k ring lmao
[1:38:36] <crimsonsaens> Robo Knight is the lost tech class

[1:38:43] <%Livelinne> DxCat
[1:38:44] <%kingkeldeo31> Lost tech = Robo knight
[1:38:45] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @riogaser lost technology opens it up
[1:38:51] <%Riottrio> wow, a 6 speed boost
[1:38:53] <%Th3SmartAlec> Minh are you actually going to use the Angel Wings
[1:39:02] <+hoenhime344> why do they never sell the sheild if they are getting a better shield?
[1:39:02] <%chickenhunter> you need to master a bunch of classes to get robo knight though
[1:39:03] <%Riottrio> I doubt he'll ever use the Angel wings
[1:39:05] <+gutlesscoward> needs lost tech + max out 2 certain classes
[1:39:06] <+Gespens> YELLOW SPACE PEOPLE
[1:39:06] <Sol_Install> has to land on the yellow
[1:39:06] <Shishi1205> No yellow space
[1:39:08] <Tooniearcade> We need robo knight
[1:39:13] <Paul_Cheenis_Big_Beenis> VANISH
[1:39:13] <%JeoDood> no yellow
[1:39:14] <RurouniGeo> Minh's attack actually went done because he bought the wrong weapon lol
[1:39:14] <topendbuzza> he needs to land on yellow
[1:39:15] <%Th3SmartAlec> Vanish?

[1:39:19] <SoupBowler> He kept dodging yellow spaces
[1:39:19] <+MrAtheGreat> Wabbit time!
[1:39:21] <Chipshandon12> i think its gone, it rolled to next week right
[1:39:21] <+pectusumbra> Woolie is closest to robo knight. It's monk and alchemist
[1:39:23] <crimsonsaens> The big choke from Reggie
[1:39:23] <Shishi1205> YO GET FUCKED

[1:39:32] <Shishi1205> get items
[1:39:35] <PeteyMcPickle> Has minh even landed on a yellow space since then?
[1:39:35] <DedlokPM> @Graxe_ there is a hidden class you can become if you find a piece of lost tech that you can use after mastering certain classes to become a robo knight
[1:39:37] <%kingkeldeo31> level a town before Minh squalls you
[1:39:41] <C4m3r0n0409> SQUALL
[1:39:42] <%Riottrio> @Chipshandon12 honestly, they play so slow at times that its hard to tell

[1:43:08] <%yeetdabsenpai69> DO IT
[1:43:11] <+hoenhime344> @haisho they already have. they formed the Black Counsil. and Minh defeated them
[1:43:14] <Shishi1205> Seppukku?

[1:43:25] <%jiggy_snipe> doesn't Vanish only block combat not items?
[1:43:25] <Shishi1205> Dont land in temple and kill yourself?
[1:43:26] <%xcompleasedad> Might as well invest yo money
[1:43:27] <+paladinstarbuster> can he send the wabbit
[1:43:29] <TigerClaws12> Minh has a reveal
[1:43:30] <%alpacasintophats> can't you send shit to the king from a temple?
[1:43:31] <%xcompleasedad> Good thinking
[1:43:35] <%fuji_92> DEATH WARP TACTICS
[1:43:35] <%Superdandy96> Can’t he send the wabbit through the Temple?
[1:43:36] <%alpacasintophats> which is what he needs to do?
[1:43:37] <+Gespens> Vanish blocks all targeted stuff
[1:43:42] <%Th3SmartAlec> Does he really need money at the moment
[1:43:43] <irfan_> he still has enough money to buy just a few more squalls tho
[1:43:44] <%emperordread> Commit Sudoku after investing, good idea
[1:43:46] <+kekkerscrew> Temple
[1:43:47] <Shishi1205> Quest items are dokkapon castle only
[1:43:48] <%Riottrio> @paladinstarbuster only local items, so wabbit doesn't count

[2:44:32] <%dogwelder02> nice move
[2:44:35] <%jiggy_snipe> he has like 3 turns left
[2:44:41] <%andrei11dr> Global Domination is pointless for him, all of the towns are taken
[2:44:41] <+b_aleph> If you take Llano you cripple Minh
[2:44:47] <Shishi1205> Watch him land in yellow and get fucked by a monster

[2:53:19] <+tearfuldevil> he didn't veen pray, smh
[2:53:25] <%ShadowpulseKDH1> Reggie’s getting fucked this session
[2:53:27] <BurdRightsActivist> YOU GET WHAT YOU FUCKIN DESERVE

[2:53:52] <BurdRightsActivist> Iceland is GONE
[2:53:54] <%saltpiggu> Minh got off easy
[2:53:55] <Shishi1205> Yo when is week end=

[2:54:00] <%Th3SmartAlec> Dammit
[2:54:03] <+jepupu> Woolie's darkling round went now smacking #2 around while letting #1 run away.
[2:54:05] <Shishi1205> Lets see the super OIL STONKS
[2:54:12] <crimsonsaens> You can also use 4 Spinner
[2:54:13] <%emperordread> Real heroes always get back up #TeamReggie
[2:54:14] <%purplehermit12> welp reggies boned now
[2:54:15] <%insomniacCoder> and the reggie saga ends.
[2:54:16] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @Reverend_Roscoe reggie actually did nothing
[2:54:24] <zenith0111> Woolie screwing over reggie rather than closing the gap with Minh LUL
[2:54:25] <Shishi1205> Remember lava castle 23logik
[2:54:25] <BurdRightsActivist> Dokapon Contracts > Oil
[2:54:28] <%ShadowpulseKDH1> You have yourself to blame Reggie
[2:54:32] <%Th3SmartAlec> @jepupu If he went after Minh he would'nt had got him
[2:54:33] <%doomerskeletor13> Team Reggie woolieREGGIEFUL Reggang rise up
[2:54:34] <%yeetdabsenpai69> woolie has thrown equipment away and pt people back

[2:54:46] <+zepelinnn1> the amount of shit in this game is crazy
[2:54:47] <+b_aleph> Seal their bags, Woolie
[2:54:51] <DaBigVitus> woolie so proud of doing a shit job
[2:54:53] <royb2> I cant understand how Woolie keeps focusing on the weaker of his competitors insteado f the no.1
[2:54:56] <+Reverend_Roscoe> Wasn't Woolie complaining recently about the infighting between 2nd and 3rd?
[2:54:56] <%jiggy_snipe> ugh Team Reggie BibleThump
[2:54:59] <%FaderPotater> absolute win for Minh
[2:55:01] <+therabbles> im always REGGIE GANG but idk how we're coming back from this
[2:55:05] <+pectusumbra> If woolie gets a good roll he can over turn Minh's continent
[2:55:09] <%purplehermit12> yeah im on team reggie but he's screweed.
[2:55:09] <%emperordread> @Reverend_Roscoe yup
[2:55:12] <Shishi1205> YEYEYEYE

[2:55:50] <%SuperKirby24> WOOLIE IN 2ND Kappa
[2:55:51] <%JetpackMcQuack> It’s not over yet
[2:55:52] <iggeh> remember when Woolie said he's Team Reggie
[2:55:59] <%nintega010> you were. now you're not
[2:56:02] <zenith0111> Woolie going Darkling was the best thing to happen for Minh
[2:56:09] <MaverickJoker> "I LIKE PISSING YOU OFF" - Reggie
[2:56:10] <crossing_mao> Riiiiiiight
[2:56:16] <Shishi1205> it was random
[2:56:22] <%dogwelder02> fuck
[2:56:23] <%saltpiggu> it could have been really bad for minh tho
[2:56:24] <zocano> Minh’s territories are hard to get to and would require a lot of darkling points to overturn, Reggie is just the actual efficient target
[2:56:25] <%Andrizzleton> Hoes, how are they?
[2:56:25] <%Superdandy96> Remember when Woolie said he’s Team Reggie?
[2:56:25] <%yeetdabsenpai69> go upstairs
[2:56:27] <Nillard> Do you feel like a hero now?
[2:56:28] <crossing_mao> PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt

[2:56:42] <+Goku01899> When does Avdol show up? Kappa
[2:56:45] <fullmetal_faux> PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt
[2:56:45] <Shishi1205> YEYEYE
[2:56:46] <Junkles> the Minh get Minher
[2:56:47] <%ShadowpulseKDH1> Lol...that’s a lie
[2:56:48] <%jiggy_snipe> Reggie's decision making was so poor during that darkling that he deserves this
[2:56:49] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[2:56:50] <moonologist> Leopard man! Illegal leopard
[2:56:56] <zenith0111> @zocano No because Darklings about closing the gap not just screwing over random targets
[2:57:00] <%GenesisKnight> Minh Exotic
[2:57:01] <%insomniacCoder> woolie is the hero later
[2:57:05] <+paladinstarbuster> rabbit danube
[2:57:09] <+tearfuldevil> "rar"
[2:57:11] <+jepupu> Get cities you dumb Reggie
[2:57:14] <+tearfuldevil> i loved that little rar
[2:57:16] <+zepelinnn1> rawr xD
[2:57:18] <%saltpiggu> time for reggie to go darkling
[2:57:18] <+tearfuldevil> very cute
[2:57:18] <zenith0111> @zocano As Darkling your sole target should be the 1st place player
[2:57:19] <CookieDoughFK> Darkling now Hero Later!
[2:57:24] <+green715> Leopard King Minh
[2:57:27] <+therabbles> if woolie can somehow pull 300 darkling points for another castle steal
[2:57:30] <%prime_name> did reggie turn in the rabbit?
[2:57:35] <moonologist> broke ass
[2:57:38] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @prime_name yes
[2:57:38] <%jiggy_snipe> yes he turned in the wabbit
[2:57:41] <%emperordread> @CookieDoughFK It's like the KoTOR streams
[2:57:41] <Shishi1205> As darkling you can fuck both if you're lucky
[2:57:42] <%ShadowpulseKDH1> You have no money
[2:57:46] <+gutlesscoward> @zenith0111 to be fair, minh is making himself really tough to go after
[2:57:50] <RurouniGeo> why even bother to go shop lol like come on reggie
[2:57:51] <zocano> @zenith0111 Except steal castle is random and woolie would waste of a lot time getting over to the bottom left area
[2:58:00] <Shishi1205> Woolie continues to invest in light later points
[2:58:06] <crossing_mao> The laugh of despair
[2:58:07] <zenith0111> @ @gutlesscoward Which is why Darkling is so good
[2:58:18] <+pectusumbra> if woolie rolls big he can just fuck minh by infesting that africa continent
[2:58:20] <zenith0111> @zocano There's more to do besides stealing castles
[2:58:30] <3rdRunner> It's already infested
[2:58:31] <Shishi1205> woolie only has 1 more turn
[2:58:34] <+Amaideus> None of those options presented themsleves
[2:58:35] <Shishi1205> (i think)
[2:58:36] <CookieDoughFK> Light Later is the only way Woolie knows
[2:58:37] <Reizie_Etherealm> Minh doesn't leave a lot of openings, unlike Reggie
[2:58:38] <%purplehermit12> @pectusumbra Woolie is absolutely just gonna rip reggies towns from canada
[2:58:42] <Xeno351> Woolies item stop effect carries over after dark lung so locking them down to take towns is a good idea
[2:58:43] <+therabbles> global assault wouldn't be worth it but a castle steal would be big
[2:58:45] <%jiggy_snipe> Woolie's 1st darkling he used Castle Panic and Global Assault
[2:58:48] <%Kriss1827> its all up to the roll
[2:58:52] <+pectusumbra> if he rolls low he can do item stop
[2:58:53] <moonologist> 5
[2:58:54] <+pectusumbra> woof
[2:58:57] <+therabbles> boo these rolls
[2:58:57] <+Amaideus> His region is isolated, and he ran to an area he could instantly escape from
[2:58:58] <%dogwelder02> yeah woolie made the right play
[2:58:58] <+pectusumbra> spend it
