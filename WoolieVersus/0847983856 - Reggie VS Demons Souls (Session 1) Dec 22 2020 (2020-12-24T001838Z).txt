[0:06:18] <Tuba_Anon> @BallerSwagBro9k reset your router. Running fine for me bro
[0:06:20] <+cvp5127> fuck politicians
[0:06:22] <DSD24> Its too vague
[0:06:27] <%X2Eliah> Twitch is a streaming site tho
[0:06:27] <DianaTheAscian> my anime
[0:06:28] <Dante_Namikaze1> they will still find a way to fuck us
[0:06:36] <abelincoln_catpuncher> yeah the stream is fine for me also
[0:06:36] <%yusefHD> Hot dog legislation lmfao
[0:06:37] <JetpackMcQuack> and the patriot act is to screen for terrorism
[0:06:38] <%thesickestzak> NEXT THEYLL TARGET GAMERS
[0:06:42] <%jinking79> but fuck the risk not happening
[0:06:53] <fuji_92> yeah shit is vague so it can be malleable and fuck everybody
[0:06:54] <@Solidus_113> it's vague on purpose
[0:06:54] <andre11dr> But still getting a felony over that shit, it's fucking ridiculous
[0:07:03] <JetpackMcQuack> no one ever misuses law
[0:07:10] <%X2Eliah> uhh gun analogies might not work when talking about Americans being stupid

[0:07:30] <abelincoln_catpuncher> @x2eliah LUL LUL LUL
[0:07:32] <+eanscrale> Defacto vs Dejure.
[0:07:39] <+McSoliace> there are so many laws that are like this, that worrying about every single one would destroy you
[0:07:54] <andre11dr> The Music Industry is the fucking most Eldritch Evil shit ever
[0:08:03] <MothmanGuile> The worst part is how it got shoehorned into a covid bill that had nothing to do with copyright laws
[0:08:17] <bloopmainbtw> the entertainment industry needs to just fucking go
[0:08:18] <KeiganOfAstora> This is gonna be so good
[0:08:22] <bloopmainbtw> evil scumbags
[0:08:23] <jamsbybetty> US legislation is fundamentally broken
[0:08:25] <%AlteisenReiseZ> But Woolie, no one /EVER/ misuses the law to line their own pockets!
[0:08:31] <%X2Eliah> Well the thing is, people are already abusing the dmca stuff on twitch etc, so its easy to see how this law could fuck people over right now
[0:08:39] <coreyyotto> there's all kinds of shady shit in the bill because they managed to merge it with the general continuing budget bill
[0:08:41] <abelincoln_catpuncher> the music industry is like EA level fucking evil
[0:08:46] <%Spydurman> @WoolieVersus I DM'ed you the exact wording to the bill. It all times into existing law called Title 17 so since it's not used against streamers right now it's not likely to be used against you but who knows
[0:08:49] <bloopmainbtw> *legislation is fundamentally broken
[0:08:49] <+JoePReal> They eventually will try. Absolutely.
[0:08:56] <%yusefHD> Unrelated, but you need to bump the Dipset Christmas Album btw. It's a classic. Like halfway through it just turns back into a Dipset album smh
[0:08:56] <%ChoculaUltra> are we still doing the hour of chill before the game starts? I think I wanna grab some food real quick
[0:09:04] <@Moobot> Please don't fill up the entire chat, @blastyoboots
[0:09:07] <%X2Eliah> Yeah, hour of chill
[0:09:08] <%dreadedcthulhu> intentional ambiguity is... less than good
[0:09:12] <%ChoculaUltra> eggcellent
[0:09:17] <+McSoliace> they literally put it in the covid bill we're fucked
[0:09:18] <%BestTeaMaker> Thanks for the 2020Takeout @rytyoung
[0:09:28] <+krispen_wa> REJECT LAWS, RETURN TO MONKE
[0:09:29] <JetpackMcQuack> that legislatoe is sponsored by multiple media companies, unrelated fact
[0:09:29] <%Feralspirit41> The laws regarding internet content seriously need to be updated to be more clear over who can do what
[0:09:30] <+cvp5127> literal parasites
[0:09:31] <fuji_92> more like days later yeah
[0:09:33] <%X2Eliah> Intentional ambiguity is *great* if you have a team of highly paid lawyers
[0:09:36] <ColbyBryant> Streaming should be free, like the buffalo
[0:09:36] <KeiganOfAstora> it's so fucked upt hat it's attached to anything
[0:09:38] <%yusefHD> Dalai Lama revive spell was in the bill too lmfao
[0:09:39] <jamsbybetty> all this fuckery with bills was supposed to be fixable through amendments but constitutional originalists have fucked this country over for DECADES
[0:09:43] <KeiganOfAstora> It shouold be it's own thing, not a side-joke
[0:09:43] <abelincoln_catpuncher> literal trash
[0:09:46] <+zanzibar_junker> 600 fuckinf dollars
[0:09:52] <coreyyotto> what y'all doing with your 600 freedom bux?

[0:10:05] <rasamune> Grant for the perverted arts
[0:10:05] <SomersaultJustice> attach a rider
[0:10:05] <+Wiithan6> Funding for the "perverted arts"
[0:10:06] <KeiganOfAstora> You ruined it
[0:10:11] <%jiggy_snipe> I imagine the law will require an intention mens rea. Streaming a game with dmca music probably won't apply but we'll see
[0:10:16] <jamsbybetty> 600 is LESS than HALF my fucking rent
[0:10:17] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Okay paperclip do your thing
[0:10:18] <abelincoln_catpuncher> 600 whole fucking dollars isn't even enough for my rent smhhl
[0:10:21] <%LastHazzerd> Attach a rider to the bill, 100000 dollers for the perverted arts
[0:10:27] <coreyyotto> @jiggy_snipe lol no
[0:10:35] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @WoolieVersus just tagged you in the joke lul
[0:10:41] <JetpackMcQuack> I didn't win but neither did you
[0:10:41] <+blastyoboots> See my earlier message for the change to the bill. Before passing they made it "SERVICES for the purpose of airing copyrighted content", not "STREAMS for the purpose" etc. So less bad.
[0:10:43] <jamsbybetty> the stimulus is inside your representatives and you have to get it out, like a pinata
[0:10:48] <coreyyotto> mens rea hasn't been relevant in copyright law for ages
[0:10:50] <MothmanGuile> We might have gotten $1200, still not much, but a single republican blocked that
[0:10:52] <+zanzibar_junker> $600 for the year
[0:10:57] <%jiggy_snipe> @coreyyotto well I'm an attorney so crimes require mens rea typically
[0:11:08] <Scrub_Seeker> honestly if i could give up the 600$ to block the bill from going through i would, in terms of making the money last it might as well be 10$ so fuck it
[0:11:09] <%LastHazzerd> biased as hell
[0:11:14] <bloopmainbtw> every evil scum says thet it won't be that bad
[0:11:15] <andre11dr> People have given me shit over this, but i believe getting DMCA on music from dead people is really dumb
[0:11:23] <+Story_Ark> $600 for a whole year, might as well have given us nintendo points
[0:11:24] <JetpackMcQuack> this is america
[0:11:26] <%LastHazzerd> Net Nutrality
[0:11:31] <%Spydurman> @WoolieVersus The exact wording of the bill is in the attachment on his site
[0:11:32] <bloopmainbtw> politicians are a cancer on society
[0:11:33] <%yusefHD> Two fuckin words for y'all. Dalai Lama Revival Spell.
[0:11:37] <derap41> So many open to interpretation bills

[0:11:54] <JetpackMcQuack> working as intended
[0:11:56] <+TheSponch> Howdy
[0:11:56] <+Hasmeister96> Wait what did I miss?
[0:11:58] <masterfire23> $600 goes to a new console, doesn't even cover living expenses
[0:11:59] <Solidnick18> yeah
[0:12:10] <%yusefHD> The bill had a statement approving the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama lmao

[0:29:55] <%hax_metatron> lobosHype lobosHype lobosHype
[0:29:58] <%jiggy_snipe> what a weirdo
[0:30:04] <JayEarly> prepare for jank
[0:30:08] <dundore77> Woolie went the most backwards way to do it
[0:30:08] <Pookiedaexzile> Two attack, Move, Evade, Guard, Parry
[0:30:10] <JayEarly> more jank
[0:30:10] <Goraka91> I bounced off Dark Souls hard, got past Capra Demon and just wasn't feeling it
[0:30:11] <venomfury86> I started with Bloodborne
[0:30:12] <%X2Eliah> REGGIE THIS GAME YOU NEVER PLAYED IS DIFFERENT FROM THIS OTHER GAME YOU NEVER PLAYED
[0:30:19] <%hax_metatron> debugDead debugDead debugDead debugDead
[0:30:23] <%strugglepunk2> strugglepunk2 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 25 months! 25 and feelin' fine. Good luck, Reggie. Umbasa.
[0:30:24] <VoraciousKain> wooo
[0:30:25] <abelincoln_catpuncher> LUL
[0:30:25] <%ZweihanderSteve> wait is bloodborne third strike in this context??
[0:30:27] <%jinking79> slower than the Dark Souls games
[0:30:28] <Solidnick18> LUL
[0:30:30] <+Jaromero435> just be a good gamer
[0:30:31] <derap41> Fair
[0:30:32] <KeiganOfAstora> LUL
[0:30:35] <sileo_patronus> The difficulty is overstated
[0:30:36] <Dave_VD> You'll be fine
[0:30:37] <Aydarkzero> @venomfury86 out of curiosity what was the next souls game you played?
[0:30:38] <dante_9x> Take your time
[0:30:40] <ht109> oh good, ads. i didn't want to watch anyway <.<
[0:30:40] <+twohitgood> this is probably the easiest of the games. just going slow will make it a ton easier.
[0:30:43] <$BallerSwagBro9k> EASIEST SOUL GAME
[0:30:43] <%X2Eliah> Yeah, tbh it is super easy
[0:30:44] <+McSoliace> more like starting SFex
[0:30:44] <+TheotherKristian> Woolie out there with the most BACKWARDS-ASS PLAY ORDER - 2, Bloodborne, 3, 1, Des, Half of Sekiro lol
[0:30:48] <Pookiedaexzile> Bloodborne is 3rd Strike, DS3 is Alpha 2 tho
[0:30:48] <+0neReeler> impossibru
[0:30:49] <%jiggy_snipe> Patience
[0:30:49] <notorious_rng> @jinking79 its literally faster than ds1 and 2
[0:30:50] <rReizs> lets go SPEEDBORNE
[0:30:50] <KeiganOfAstora> You need to learn the game's pace
[0:30:51] <Louie_Salmon> I can't wait for the clips this will create
[0:30:53] <+McSoliace> in terms of ds2
[0:30:53] <%superc37> well youre in luck reggie, cuz DES is probably the easiest out of all of them. its just REALLY fucking obtuse
[0:30:54] <+worldbrand> all-rounding is viable in this game and not really in any of the others
[0:30:55] <%ConLin_Arts_> I started with this on PS3, then Dark Souls on Ps3 and then Bloodborne, I have Sekiro but haven't played it yet
[0:30:55] <%RyTYoung> SORRY
[0:30:55] <%ekodrop> swing the sword
[0:30:56] <+HeroSolaire> Is this reggie first souls game?
[0:30:56] <%X2Eliah> Like if you don't have 33% done by end of today, something's wrong
[0:30:56] <%linSP> you can do it reggie
[0:30:57] <fuji_92> this is the easy one reggie, u got this
[0:30:57] <SivSarcast> Woolie's Dark Souls order was quite interesting.
[0:30:58] <%ChoculaUltra> there's a method to the madness
[0:31:03] <VoraciousKain> at this point the difficulty is exaggerated
[0:31:04] <Pookiedaexzile> Surge is King of Figihters
[0:31:04] <+mywifeleftme_dot_mp4> Game is pretty easy
[0:31:05] <Firststrike_OW> Reggie has this!
[0:31:06] <%ggbhtg> Not your av er age Character Actioning
[0:31:08] <Daniel_Is_I> Souls games punish your mistakes but they're not unfair
[0:31:11] <dante_9x> Reggie we believe
[0:31:11] <lambishly> Reggie playing?! PogChamp
[0:31:12] <Pookiedaexzile> Nioh is Guilty Gear
[0:31:13] <therealtacopancakes> yooooo it's starting
[0:31:19] <+babyacid> i just ordered KFC :(
[0:31:20] <elshadow7> Is Reggie S P E E D ?
[0:31:22] <andre11dr> Kings Field is SF1 in quality exceptionally LUL
[0:31:24] <%ConLin_Arts_> Drop your Shield Reggie
[0:31:28] <abelincoln_catpuncher> the stamina bar and animation timing is the hardest aspect imo
[0:31:28] <velgaduere> special, unknowable circumstances
[0:31:32] <KeiganOfAstora> Woolie, play Dark Souls 3!!!
[0:31:33] <%superc37> no. zangief is playing /s
[0:31:37] <venomfury86> @aydarkzero Dark Souls 1, it was rough getting used to a slower pace
[0:31:37] <JayEarly> I think this game was the hardest to play through for the first time, and I played Dark Souls first
[0:31:38] <%ekodrop> let him stumble a lot
[0:31:38] <%cache_22> Let Reggie build his own funnels.
[0:31:39] <+TheotherKristian> ZERO HINTS
[0:31:41] <%ggbhtg> @andre11dr where does Shadow Tower fit in?
[0:31:42] <OldManDeckardCain> "a bit"
[0:31:42] <+KgKid51> if woolie saids drop your shield a lot I will lose it hggLul
[0:31:43] <+Jaromero435> Chat do you think Reggie will be a big armor boy or a flippy dodge boy?
[0:31:43] <KeiganOfAstora> You learn from your mistakes
[0:31:44] <lambishly> You got this Reggie
[0:31:48] <KeiganOfAstora> Big armor
[0:31:50] <%linSP> woolieMIRIN
[0:31:51] <+HeroSolaire> Funilly souls games are the least unfair games of the "souls game genre"
[0:31:58] <KeiganOfAstora> I think he'll like having a shield
[0:31:59] <teh_Question> hopefully pat lent woolie his [c r a z y t a l k] stand
[0:32:01] <+Story_Ark> "say the line woolz" "drop your shield" "yaaaaaaay!"
[0:32:05] <Aydarkzero> @venomfury86 yeah it's gotta be strange going from BB to any previous game
[0:32:13] <+HeroSolaire> Been playing Jedi Fallen Order and that games gets unfair really quick
[0:32:17] <%ggbhtg> SHIELD MEMES BROKE, NEW MEMES shall AWOKE
[0:32:18] <Louie_Salmon> I can't wait to see either Woolie eat his words, or for Reggie to kick ass
[0:32:18] <lambishly> Is this Reggie's first 'souls'?
[0:32:25] <derap41> Open corridors
[0:32:28] <%X2Eliah> It's basically like Assassin's Creed
[0:32:28] <+PenGia> ye
[0:32:29] <Pookiedaexzile> Lets start peer pressuring Reggie into becoming a mage
[0:32:29] <%dreadedcthulhu> non-linear for sure
[0:32:30] <Aydarkzero> @lambishly yes it is
[0:32:30] <Equirah> @lambishly yes
[0:32:31] <velgaduere> it's... open-choice
[0:32:31] <%FeelinNifty> Megaman-inspired exploration

[0:36:43] <DianaTheAscian> Pat says royal but thats Pat
[0:36:47] <+twohitgood> yeah, royalty is the easiest starting class.
[0:36:50] <+HeroSolaire> Recommend not picking a class with dumb heavy armor

[0:37:00] <+gnoame> Thanks for the 2020Forward @usotaku
[0:37:01] <BaslerJones> Temple Knight looks like a Gondor Soldier
[0:37:08] <%X2Eliah> "Reggarth" is not the name of a lucky build
[0:37:09] <JayEarly> temple knight looks like a Gondor soldier
[0:37:13] <JayEarly> that‚Äôs cool
[0:37:19] <andre11dr> I think I went Royalty in the Remake, but that was fore Second Chance
[0:37:22] <+krispen_wa> Man the faces look so much better in this game
[0:37:27] <%SilverDevilfish> Reggarth of the Royal Mountains Kappa
[0:37:28] <buster7800> end is the god stat
[0:37:32] <%X2Eliah> "Reggarth" could be tanky, swordy, or even shooty. But not lucky.
[0:37:33] <DrkJP520> Oh no, item weight is still in this
[0:37:37] <@Menitta> I fucked up my numbers at first. I thought Vitality increased equipment number but it didnt so now I'm vital as fuck
[0:37:48] <+krispen_wa> but you can send items to the box directly so item weight means less
[0:37:51] <+KgKid51> item weight sucks imo
[0:37:56] <DSD24> Hunter looks kinda dorky
[0:37:56] <%jessyg920> I feel like Reggarth needs to be a Barbarian
[0:38:04] <KeiganOfAstora> What are you talking about
[0:38:07] <Pookiedaexzile> But dex tho
[0:38:11] <KeiganOfAstora> That was a weird way to explains caling
[0:38:12] <KeiganOfAstora> scaling*
[0:38:14] <@Menitta> Reggarth the Nameless needs to be a wanderer imo
[0:38:14] <TheArrow_> the stockpile thomas buff in this remake is crazy
[0:38:14] <Aydarkzero> yeah Demon's Souls is rough for good roll need like 40 Endurance for a fast roll
[0:38:15] <%X2Eliah> Reggarth sounds royal though, no?
[0:38:22] <%jetjagger222> magic knight regarth
[0:38:23] <JayEarly> @menitta least more hp is never useless
[0:38:31] <KeiganOfAstora> Reggarth sounds brutish
[0:38:38] <JayEarly> coulda put it all in luck
[0:38:40] <DSD24> Depending on how you say Reggarth it could go either way
[0:38:41] <@Menitta> @JayEarly Yeah it wasnt bad but I did find it funny lmao
[0:38:45] <Aydarkzero> first build i made was jack of all trades build LUL
[0:38:57] <Blank9> Yeah, knight and jack of all trades was fun
[0:39:01] <Aydarkzero> ^
[0:39:03] <$cureneckbeard> woolie is saying "dextirity"
[0:39:11] <KeiganOfAstora> I usually go with Dex so I can use bows well and kite enemies from a distance. Thin them out y'know
[0:39:12] <+Story_Ark> katana is japanese for dexterity
[0:39:18] <%ggbhtg> Get you a gurl who can do both
[0:39:20] <Aydarkzero> Levelling Dex Kappa

[0:39:26] <%X2Eliah> hmmm
[0:39:28] <Arek_1> Reggie, don't worry. You can hide the helmet in the options.
[0:39:31] <CappuccinoGuil> magic is fun, though
[0:39:33] <$SilverRoddo> I‚Äôm here woolieFUN
[0:39:36] <%SilverDevilfish> Unlike DS3 magic actually does something in this game Kappa
[0:39:36] <DianaTheAscian> magic in this is busted

[0:40:12] <AncelDeLambert> put on the training wheels, Reggie, accept knighthood
[0:40:13] <%hax_metatron> @Menitta DS1 has atheist clerics
[0:40:13] <CappuccinoGuil> miracles are support skills. Magic is offensive skills
[0:40:14] <andre11dr> "You don't need to ever cast spells" All invaders staring at Second Chance on their spell slot

[0:40:55] <%X2Eliah> not Reggie Darth?
[0:40:58] <%Graxe_> There are counter hits, too
[0:40:58] <%Lion_kun> Also bonus if you hit when an enemy is attacking
[0:40:59] <venomfury86> @pjbuster yes
[0:41:03] <andre11dr> Aren't criticals in this, or did that first show up in DS1?
[0:41:04] <prime_name> FIRE EMBLEM ALWAYS WINS
[0:41:04] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:41:05] <dundore77> Doesn't luck also up everything by like .1?
[0:41:08] <TheArrow_> reggarth is a knight name i think
[0:41:11] <glass_marcus> Sword of Luck and Pluck for an example
[0:41:12] <alvaroeltz> doenst the game treat critical hits as backstabs?
[0:41:14] <Dementedpenguin> Ever since I started working night shift, I value seeing these live even more now PogChamp
[0:41:21] <+TopTieramisu> ????
[0:41:32] <Pookiedaexzile> Thief
[0:41:33] <%Graxe_> I think Luck affects status resistances?
[0:41:37] <@Moobot> Please don't fill up the entire chat, @KeiganOfAstora
[0:41:40] <MothmanGuile> @dementedpenguin good luck. I used to do night shift, it can be rough
[0:41:47] <KeiganOfAstora> A direct hit often occurs with a R1 attack after a push (forward+R1), but the hit-distance also varies from one weapon to another. The Master's Ring will add a further 15% on top of this, but at the expense of all other attacks dealing less damage.
[0:41:48] <BoneBagMel> Good luck Reggie!
[0:41:48] <%X2Eliah> NO DON'T MAKE MISTAKES
[0:41:52] <JayEarly> @andre11dr if you mean backstabs and ripostes, yes
[0:41:53] <KeiganOfAstora> nooooo
[0:41:53] <Dementedpenguin> @MothmanGuile LUL thanks
[0:41:57] <KeiganOfAstora> Don't pick Royalty
[0:41:57] <andre11dr> No wait that's wrong criticals are in this, there's a ring that gives you better crits
[0:42:02] <KeiganOfAstora> It's too easy
[0:42:07] <Aydarkzero> doesn't also come with the mp regen ring?
[0:42:10] <TheArrow_> magic is super op
[0:42:17] <%Dapper_Cactuar> Royalty, wanderer, and knight were the 3 I was suggested
[0:42:21] <+aishman> "It's too easy" naw make it easy. This is Demon's Souls.
[0:42:21] <Arek_1> Direct hits (sweetspots) only happen with a few axes.
[0:42:22] <+krispen_wa> FEAR THE NAKED MAN
[0:42:24] <Louie_Salmon> Naked is fast
[0:42:24] <%Graxe_> Royalty starts with MP stuff, yeah

[0:42:31] <AncelDeLambert> magic gud
[0:42:32] <KeiganOfAstora> Magic is easy because many enemies are weak to magic and you can attack from range without getting hurt

[0:44:17] <andre11dr> Reggie kinda needs to decide wich weapons will use now
[0:44:19] <alfonso165> go pure faith
[0:44:21] <+penjaza> Thief's stat allocation is garbage and is terrible for beginners
[0:44:22] <JayEarly> @prevot is dex considered a scrub stat
[0:44:22] <XeroSigmaPrime> Do we steal Pat energy and go LUCKY TED

[0:44:32] <+TheotherKristian> They're all good classes, except the one class
[0:44:33] <KeiganOfAstora> It's just a D&D name thing
[0:44:35] <BaslerJones> LUCKY REG
[0:44:36] <+xpakeo> classes only matter for stats
[0:44:37] <%X2Eliah> It's not SKyrim Thief
[0:44:38] <Pookiedaexzile> Stop trying to sandbag thief Woolie
[0:44:41] <+krispen_wa> dex is not being HUGE and therefore pathetic
[0:44:41] <Pookiedaexzile> we see you son
[0:44:41] <%Th3SmartAlec> just hit the guy really hard
[0:44:41] <DrkJP520> Important to note is that starting class only affects your STARTING stats and equipment. Every "class" can still level up different stats and potentially use every weapon/spell in the game.
[0:44:41] <+McSoliace> tell him about wander then
[0:44:48] <Tampaoster> They are just templates for the numbers

[0:44:49] <%dreadedcthulhu> thief is more of an assassin
[0:44:49] <%Lion_kun> It just means Dex build
[0:44:50] <+Tevvy> Stats and starting gear is all this is. just say that.
[0:44:56] <$MateoPeso> Thief would probably be kinda rough
[0:44:57] <dundore77> You also can just go the complete opposite direction of a starting class. theif can be a big buff hit boy later if you want
[0:45:01] <venomfury86> you're invisible from a certain distance
[0:45:03] <DSD24> Wanderer has a cool scarf

[0:45:14] <andre11dr> Going Lucky Ted in this game is how yoy actually get to the most optimal damage
[0:45:14] <+krispen_wa> whoa that armor looks different
[0:45:15] <+penjaza> Please pick Wanderer over Thief if you wanna go Dex
[0:45:15] <KeiganOfAstora> I forgot about Priest

[0:53:40] <+solzan2000> yooo demons souls \o/
[0:53:42] <+Jaromero435> white people LUL
[0:53:42] <+McSoliace> same
[0:53:44] <DSD24> How can you see your own eye color?
[0:53:47] <rohrvg> I only notice people with really bright eyes
[0:53:47] <brunoberserk> the maddengan
[0:53:48] <OblivionSword1> that's absolutely a white people thing
[0:53:49] <+solzan2000> Umbasa \o/
[0:53:49] <DianaTheAscian> white people
[0:53:50] <$MateoPeso> I got light eyes and I'm mexican
[0:53:51] <KeiganOfAstora> It's not always about you Woolie LUL
[0:53:51] <+KgKid51> that's actually true for me too
[0:53:54] <@Menitta> Everyone in my family has blue eyes so I care more since its a recessive gene
[0:53:55] <MAX116030> Eye colour is huge in Asia
[0:54:01] <$Invlux> I'm white and I don't know ppls eye colors bc of anxiety
[0:54:03] <%SilverDevilfish> It's like Japan and their fucking blood types
[0:54:04] <Pookiedaexzile> He said it now twitter has to harrass him
[0:54:06] <Bluewolf544> Its just a woolie thing Kappa
[0:54:06] <+khalcipher> Its a white thing. Mexicans all have brown eyes sooo we really dont care
[0:54:06] <kenny_biff> definitly white people- I MEAN CULTURAL
[0:54:07] <dabeaminator> I don't notice it because I'm afraid of eye contact... It's a rough life.
[0:54:07] <yuribo26> Theres one color in my family, BROWN
[0:54:10] <+AceVenturaPhD> damn id think everyone having the same eyecolor youd pay way more attention like WOAH BLUE EYES
[0:54:10] <+McSoliace> being black made me completely forget eyes
[0:54:13] <Aydarkzero> a girl told me i had nice eyes once
[0:54:14] <ashenjuan25> It‚Äôs a whitey thing
[0:54:15] <%X2Eliah> @DSD24 mirror.
[0:54:16] <derap41> insight gained

[0:54:19] <slix3431> @WoolieVersus Reggie told me my eyes were beautiful!
[0:54:19] <KeroKamina> i'm black and eye color bsi big for me
[0:54:22] <Prevot> woolie doesn't see (eye) color
[0:54:24] <+Hasmeister96> @SilverDevilfish was that originally a Chinese thing?
[0:54:24] <ChungusQuest> naw but glowing purple eyes leaking light-absorbing black flame, tho
[0:54:24] <%ggbhtg> Chappelle Show "I KNOW WHITE PEOPLE" game show worthy LUL
[0:54:26] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @MAX116030 to me that's surprising, what's the context there?
[0:54:26] <DSD24> @X2Eliah Yeah I didn't think that through
[0:54:27] <alvaroeltz> one thing i noticed with character creator is that a black person with a clear eye color is very weird because its so uncommon
[0:54:28] <elshadow7> Wouldn't that make other colors stand out more?
[0:54:29] <%dreadedcthulhu> I'm white as hell and still don't notice eye color
[0:54:32] <Bluewolf544> @derap41 Frenzy buildup
[0:54:37] <DedlokPM> I also don't pay attention to eye colors
[0:54:37] <Ashenik1> there are other races of people than white and black Woolie

[1:16:34] <BinaryShuffle> Blocking is for cowards!!!
[1:16:36] <justlikehumans> why does noone on this channel know what right is
[1:16:37] <+blastyoboots> it's usually a Kick or a Headbutt; the Scimitar has a special one that's a slash-and-backstep. try it with your Dagger instead
[1:16:40] <DrkJP520> For the falchion it's not really a guard brake, more of an evade
[1:16:40] <MAX116030> now Woolie is on oppose end of this LUL

[1:16:45] <RetributionP> ohhh noooo
[1:16:51] <%Graxe_> Dex weapons usually are a attack and backstep
[1:16:52] <%Lion_kun> Is there a jump attack?
[1:16:53] <Bluewolf544> Woolie Tybe B
[1:16:59] <Owkono> what if they both do the opposite, yielding the right answer

[1:17:03] <andre11dr> The fist has the best one ,like actually
[1:17:05] <KeiganOfAstora> backstep attack
[1:17:05] <+wydamn> @FrostedZaibatsu they got out of the character creator like 15 minutes ago
[1:17:05] <+yukichocomilk> backstep is useless LUL
[1:17:06] <Louie_Salmon> Isn't it technically the running attack?
[1:17:08] <KeiganOfAstora> and a run
[1:17:12] <KeiganOfAstora> running + R1
[1:17:14] <CappuccinoGuil> @Lion_kun no, but there IS vaulting and climb up ledges
[1:17:15] <+TheotherKristian> Is backstep the most criminially underutilized thing in the whole series?
[1:17:16] <FrostedZaibatsu> @wydamn cool. thanks
[1:17:17] <+HeroSolaire> backstep is one of the most underused mechanics of the souls games lol
[1:17:20] <%BisoromiBear> never backstep
[1:17:23] <%X2Eliah> Do a Turtle build, two shields
[1:17:26] <jorniev> AH YES
[1:17:30] <+HeroSolaire> Backstep is only useful for PVP backstep attack
[1:17:32] <+Bail_seven> no jump in des @lion_kun
[1:17:33] <DianaTheAscian> u will almost never use this but its cool
[1:17:34] <+DukeBlack_> HE SAID IT
[1:17:34] <jorniev> DID REGGIE PRACTICE?

[1:19:04] <Sw0rdmstr> Got too excited
[1:19:05] <KeiganOfAstora> If a weapon requires 18 strength, you can two-hand with 12

[1:19:40] <CappuccinoGuil> Remember: dual-wield buff to wield weapons DOES NOT work with DEX weapons
[1:19:43] <therealtacopancakes> you can weild an 18 str with just 12
[1:19:49] <%Visorak6> Remember to DROP THE SHIELD
[1:19:52] <DrkJP520> You'll want to 2 hand against enemies with shields, because your attacks won't bounce off

[1:19:59] <Arek_1> Same for large shields. You can two-hand a large shield if it's too heavy for one hand.
[1:20:01] <derap41> These Tutorial are a lot better than the OG game

[1:29:25] <derap41> Sword Blocking is better than no blocking
[1:29:25] <DatAsuna> never saying
[1:29:27] <Tolmaniac> never stop saying it
[1:29:29] <Ultimatefool> Reggie out here trying to royal guard
[1:29:30] <justlikehumans> @akuda_bar him coming as close as possible to saying it without actually saying it
[1:29:32] <+Deekman> no parry in 2 hands
[1:29:32] <@akuda_bar> never ever say it
[1:29:33] <+vaderxyz1970> Have I missed the drop the shield moment?
[1:29:33] <CappuccinoGuil> Ooooooh Reggie likes the parry
[1:29:34] <venomfury86> FIST REPOSTE
[1:29:41] <%SirGO0SE> say it until we wish he never ever said it then say it twice as much
[1:29:47] <+krispen_wa> always saying something like DROP YOUR SHIELD, but never the wording
[1:29:51] <+Masked_Hero_Lucky> So that IS a thing in later games
[1:29:52] <Louie_Salmon> He should say it a different way each time like "Release your defense"
[1:29:53] <djblue_shift> zelda it up

[1:43:26] <Second_Omega> Woolie watched
[1:43:26] <Pookiedaexzile> The Reggie Regulators
[1:43:27] <DianaTheAscian> Woolie watcher was the best one
[1:43:29] <+kewlmyc> Killed a boss, time for suicide
[1:43:30] <Pookiedaexzile> Mount up
[1:43:32] <rasamune> To reap the benefits of co-op, one must subject oneself to the mortifying ordeal of being invaded.
[1:43:34] <olm46> Who watches the woolie watcher?
[1:43:35] <+wydamn> Reggie Reaper

[1:44:30] <OldManDeckardCain> with woolie's monologues it's gonna take like double the time but it's fine LUL
[1:44:34] <%Th3SmartAlec> Being black or white is more convulted than one may think

[1:44:35] <+chiazam> Maybe talk to some peeps
[1:44:42] <+Checktrap> Reggie is a good guy ! Or is he ?
[1:44:47] <%Th3SmartAlec> CREDITS
[1:44:50] <punished_piglor> perhaps
[1:44:52] <+yukichocomilk> HE SAID IT
[1:44:56] <+wydamn> But Reggie parried a dude on his first try, so he's got that going for him.

[1:45:55] <DianaTheAscian> @X2Eliah WutFace
[1:46:04] <user_naim> Oh I miss Pate already
[1:46:05] <%CavemanInCave> press R1 for hidden dialog
[1:46:10] <%Lion_kun> Reggie, you can destroy a run
[1:46:13] <CappuccinoGuil> LIP SYNC?! SORCERY
[1:46:15] <%X2Eliah> @DianaTheAscian It technically works
[1:46:19] <andre11dr> Watch Elden Ring not have lip movement
[1:46:25] <venomfury86> @cavemanincave lol
[1:46:25] <Ultimatefool> That's right Reggie. Attack to make them shut up permanently
[1:46:26] <punished_piglor> Which NPC do y'all think Reggie is going to hit first?
[1:46:28] <DianaTheAscian> @X2Eliah true
[1:46:28] <Pookiedaexzile> Go to that fat bitch in the back
[1:46:29] <CappuccinoGuil> THEY MOVE THEIR LIPS, I'M SCARED
[1:46:30] <+gespenst25> "simpleW
[1:46:33] <Pookiedaexzile> He has some shit to say
[1:46:37] <kazataca> boldwin had a skin treatment
[1:46:37] <derap41> Just noticed his glasses
[1:46:40] <KeiganOfAstora> He ain't my Andre
[1:46:42] <AncelDeLambert> this guy is enunciating like a muppet
[1:46:45] <andre11dr> @punished_piglor Ostrava
[1:46:49] <%X2Eliah> REGGIE ONE OF THESE PEOPLE IS A HOSTILE THAT YOU MUST KILL
[1:47:03] <CappuccinoGuil> @KeiganOfAstora he's not smithing at incredible hihg speeds T^T
[1:47:03] <%FeelinNifty> they're all hostile. kill them all. :)
[1:47:06] <+fizzguy47> does sekiro have mouth movement?
[1:47:08] <Marko__> @WoolieVersus Hey man! I just picked up skull girls, who should I main?
[1:47:12] <AncelDeLambert> their lips are not just moving, they appear to be attempting to unhinge their jaws
[1:47:13] <+solzan2000> no
[1:47:15] <theronhal> Sekiro has some movement
[1:47:18] <MAX116030> I mwan there is 1 character who lips move in DS1
[1:47:19] <Arek_1> @Sw0rdmstr Yeah. They white-washed the Fat Official but they changed the only useless NPC to be black. Kappa
[1:47:21] <punished_piglor> I'm guessing it'll be Stockpile Thomas.
[1:47:26] <theronhal> more like small flaps but still
[1:47:26] <KeiganOfAstora> @MAX116030 who'
[1:47:30] <pixel_river> it will be very hard to not compare elden ring and this graphically
[1:47:32] <%Lion_kun> They moved in other games, just not in sync
[1:47:37] <DianaTheAscian> i wonder if Woolie will warn him about THAT npc
[1:47:40] <%RyuuAoi> Reggie, don't listen to Woolie on this one. It's a set up! KILL EVERYONE IN THE ROOM IMMEDIATELY.
[1:47:47] <venomfury86> Aunt May: "kill them all, Reggie
[1:47:49] <+solzan2000> lol
[1:47:56] <MAX116030> @KeiganOfAstora smith
[1:47:58] <andre11dr> Oh shit i just realized, Reggie will be a really nice friend to Yurt,just as any good player should be PogChamp
[1:47:59] <Artoo_The_Me> Drop your shield...perfect
[1:48:00] <kazataca> some FROM games have had a lot of generic anime mouth flaps it's just not synced to dialogue
[1:48:01] <%X2Eliah> Oh man I hope that Reggie does not get warned about THAT ONE NPC
[1:48:14] <punished_piglor> I heard Elden Ring might be some open world thing. Kinda disappointing if true
[1:48:14] <Equirah> @KeiganOfAstora gaping dragon Kappa
[1:48:19] <+JoePReal> Andre moved his lips in DS1 cus they wanted to make him a boss at one point or something
[1:48:27] <+vaderxyz1970> The soul of little Jimmy going to be your new threads
[1:48:28] <derap41> That's an understatment
[1:48:33] <Ashenik1> What isnt ;d
[1:48:37] <%X2Eliah> Upgrading is basically... Yo uneed a guide'
[1:48:44] <@Solidus_113> Demon's Souls is convoluted in everything
[1:48:48] <DianaTheAscian> u need a chart
[1:48:51] <Equirah> @X2Eliah wollie absolutely will
[1:48:55] <%Lion_kun> The graphics aren't important, it's the visual design. Bloodborne and Sekiro have worse graphics but still look amazing.
[1:49:04] <DianaTheAscian> upgrade flowchart
[1:49:07] <kazataca> You just need a guide if you want a specific weapon. Just upgrade the weapon you like as you go
[1:49:11] <Artoo_The_Me> I missed the notification of the stream, saw the L1 R1 problem on Twitter

[1:51:40] <Lancaster_H> Remember to lower thine defensive equipment
[1:51:44] <Daniel_Is_I> The TUTORIAL HALL
[1:51:45] <Ookamiden02> only for strenght
[1:51:45] <andre11dr> "Sticky white stuff required ahead" was an actual message you could write
[1:51:46] <derap41> So it works really well with str scaling wepons
[1:52:01] <dustworthmain> 2 handed attack usually have higher base dmg too
[1:52:12] <Blank9> 2 had the best messages
[1:52:15] <Blank9> try tongue but hole
[1:52:17] <punished_piglor> Like 2 punches
[1:52:22] <%ozzrabbit> Oh, I hope Reggie gets to see the updated version of ‚ÄúSticky White Stuff here!‚Äù message!
[1:52:28] <Lancaster_H> Don't give up skeleton!
[1:52:33] <derap41> None of this was in the original game
[1:52:35] <justlikehumans> reggie, you gotta take your metal plate, and relax your right arm in order to make the metal plate be affected by gravity more then the lift from your arm, thus causing it to fall down into a non-defensive position
[1:52:41] <CappuccinoGuil> You COULD, though
[1:52:44] <%X2Eliah> Reggie has the magical ability of a plank
[1:52:49] <%Graxe_> This hall was totally in the original
[1:52:50] <punished_piglor> rude
[1:52:57] <CappuccinoGuil> Reggie should put 1 point in Magic and 3 in Faith for talking to every NPC
[1:53:16] <punished_piglor> Faith build true build.
[1:53:18] <%Graxe_> Or is it the two-handing stuff
[1:53:22] <andre11dr> Reggie should probably look into second chance
[1:53:28] <%hax_metatron> I think it would be amazing if Woolie never strings together the words "Drop Your Shield" in this playthrough. It will be the best anti-meme!!! LUL
[1:53:28] <CappuccinoGuil> Get 10 Magic and 10 Faith to talk to the Sorcery and Miracle trainers

[1:54:01] <Lancaster_H> @hax_metatron eventually he's gonna accidentally say it and then cackle for a minute
[1:54:01] <Pookiedaexzile> Reggie would love Dark souls, If you play it right you get a free shotgun fireball
[1:54:06] <+zzNamttamzz> can't even see the spells in this game if you don't have the stats
[1:54:06] <derap41> And none of this was explain in the original game

[1:58:42] <venomfury86> thank you Bluepoint
[1:58:54] <%Lion_kun> I remember having to drop all my shit in 2-2 because I was loaded with ores
[1:58:58] <+king_of_beggars> If you become burdened you could always just drop something, say, your shield?
[1:59:03] <derap41> Hard Souls instead of Soft Souls
[1:59:09] <+amurter19> You can keep upgrade shards here and still use them
[1:59:23] <Lancaster_H> its an exp potion
[1:59:23] <+warlockwithapixie> Man I gotta play this game...
[1:59:33] <%Graxe_> EXP/Money items, basically
[1:59:35] <%Jack8274> Cash vs card
[1:59:37] <therealtacopancakes> they are gift cards
[1:59:47] <AncelDeLambert> what we call "Hard Souls"
[1:59:49] <KeiganOfAstora> It's like soft sould and hard souls
[1:59:53] <KeiganOfAstora> like humanity
[2:00:02] <AncelDeLambert> or "liquid"
[2:00:04] <+Deekman> i think grains are new
[2:00:09] <$SilverRoddo> It‚Äôs like a cheque.
[2:00:11] <derap41> White stuff!
[2:00:13] <%ozzrabbit> It‚Äôs a cash card
[2:00:18] <@Solidus_113> White Slime
[2:00:20] <%CavemanInCave> red herbs and green herbs you can combine
[2:00:22] <%Graxe_> Yeah, I think the grains are new
[2:00:22] <AncelDeLambert> liquidity and savings
[2:00:34] <%Graxe_> I don't remember these defense buffs
[2:00:51] <%Jack8274> Don't let Elixir Syndrome take over Woolie
[2:00:52] <venomfury86> Sticky white stuff
[2:01:00] <punished_piglor> I don't remember my grandchildren
[2:01:03] <+krispen_wa> Sticky White UNREAL BLACK THINGS
[2:01:08] <+yukichocomilk> NEVER use consumables
[2:01:19] <%Javaa01> These are DLC items
[2:01:20] <@Solidus_113> DLC
[2:01:20] <derap41> Cheat items
[2:01:23] <fuji_92> dlc shit
[2:01:24] <+Grayhammatter> DLC
[2:01:26] <%Graxe_> That yellow mark are DLC items
[2:01:28] <%Jack8274> You can't upgrade it, so it's very useless
[2:01:38] <OblivionSword1> deluxe edition bonus stuffs
[2:01:41] <+krispen_wa> no joke I've never used a resin befoee in a souls game for fear of it not being useful
[2:01:44] <punished_piglor> Scrub gear
[2:01:50] <%Skeeternet> Yo, what‚Äôs the next Get Into: fighting game fellas?
[2:01:51] <+kewlmyc> It's not even a cheat weapon. It's weak as fuck and you can't upgrade it
[2:02:03] <%Jack8274> @krispen_wa Just buy enough so you never worry about it. I use 600 every couple of days lol
[2:02:06] <siamzero94> it ain't even round
[2:02:19] <punished_piglor> It's round-ish
[2:02:22] <%Axle13j> Axle13j subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! LETS GOOOO
[2:02:26] <+amurter19> Resin is how you beat phalanx
[2:02:29] <%bread_assassin> Weapons aren‚Äôt worth it, but the armor sets are pretty cool, though.
[2:02:32] <KeiganOfAstora> Deluxe Edition shit
[2:02:40] <punished_piglor> Reggie is how you beat Phalanx
[2:02:47] <BlackermanZX> deluxe boi
[2:02:55] <+AbnormalVoid> it sucks Dark Souls 3 didn't have a similar mechanic
[2:03:02] <%Jack8274> The damage increase from Resins is so huge, it's very worth dedicating farming runs for sticky white stuff or Pine resin. Especially for bosses weak to certain elements
[2:03:06] <+blastyoboots> TRY ON those SWAG CLOTHES go see how the royalty one looks
[2:03:09] <+krispen_wa> @jack8274 but that costs money i could be saving
[2:03:11] <+blastyoboots> just for fashion
[2:03:16] <BlackermanZX> lord reggarth born with a deluxe spoon
[2:03:19] <+AbnormalVoid> or like, a dozen other proper balancing mechanics
[2:03:26] <%Lion_kun> I love how unbalanced DES is.
[2:03:30] <%Jack8274> @krispen_wa For what? You only get to SL 100 then you have to not level anymore or else you cant coop or PVP
[2:03:33] <punished_piglor> The true late game; fashion souls
[2:03:33] <KeiganOfAstora> doo doo
[2:03:34] <derap41> Fashion is king
[2:03:39] <%Lion_kun> Gives it a unique charm.
[2:03:41] <Lancaster_H> that's the ONLY way
[2:03:44] <+erkicman> Fashion Souls is Replay Value incarnate
[2:03:48] <prime_name> Fashion is most important stat
[2:04:15] <+Neku054> think woolie might be going too deep into explaining but migh tbe for the best
[2:04:17] <+krispen_wa> @jack8274 i know but I've got the mind gobbos and spending anything makes my souls go down and that makes me feel bad
[2:05:03] <%Jack8274> @krispen_wa That is a legit issue sorry to hear that. I got over that a couple of years ago, and have been enjoying games so much more
[2:05:20] <%Jack8274> I call it Elixir Syndrome lol
[2:05:20] <%Th3SmartAlec> hello there
[2:05:21] <%Zayasu> hi :)

[2:15:39] <DianaTheAscian> I think Reggie has done more parrys in the last 2hrs than almost all the old lps combined
[2:15:42] <venomfury86> 1st rule: Don't panic
[2:15:47] <%Jack8274> Holding Down on the Dpad will always go to the first slot as well. Useful to put your emergency healing items there
[2:16:02] <+Jaysky> Rule 2: PANIK
[2:16:05] <bevyrage> reggie parry counter is on 8 right now
[2:16:09] <kazataca> always keep 1 sharpening stone for emergencies
[2:16:20] <bevyrage> pat's parry counter is like 4, and woolie's parry counter is ~20

[2:57:12] <Shishi1205> Counter hit dmg has always been ridiculous in souls games
[2:57:14] <+wydamn> I think DeS has counter hit on thrusting weapons like spears
[2:57:18] <+Masked_Hero_Lucky> Right, anything with an axe-like head
[2:57:21] <%Javaa01> You have to hit the enemy at the start of their recovery frames for counter hit bonus damage
[2:57:21] <+Stupid121v2> BOOOOO!
[2:57:25] <%Javaa01> With associated weapons
[2:57:28] <+faintsmile> I KNOW YOU

[2:59:17] <%johnny_gogo> reggies got the good grass?

[2:59:28] <derap41> Its more for poking than killing
[2:59:29] <venomfury86> you don't need a map since you'll pass through the same area multiple times
[2:59:32] <%X2Eliah> swinging*
[2:59:41] <%Jack8274> Crossbows are good for pulling aggro too

[3:00:01] <%X2Eliah> LUL
[3:00:01] <+faintsmile> that poor sword
[3:00:10] <%Jack8274> You are parrying the arm, not the weapon. That's a useful tip for spacing

[3:00:13] <Mangahero18> that sword is gonna break soon
[3:00:14] <%X2Eliah> Sword at risk

[3:04:44] <heartlesshealer> @X2Eliah Ah, fair enough
[3:04:49] <sothatsprettybrutal> what does woolie's shirt say?
[3:04:58] <+paladinstarbuster> to late woolie
[3:05:02] <Manmush> jet set radio
[3:05:03] <+Deekman> he also won't come out of that door
[3:05:05] <redrins> crab claw
[3:05:05] <Shishi1205> you can claw for items
[3:05:09] <+krispen_wa> just claw
[3:05:10] <derap41> Reggie needs to learn the Claw
[3:05:12] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> gotta claw that
[3:05:14] <Ner234> The CLAW
[3:05:16] <velgaduere> Reggie is taking this soul loss fairly well
[3:05:17] <%Jack8274> You use the Tekken grip
[3:05:18] <+chiazam> that's the point
[3:05:19] <resloxxx> LUL
[3:05:22] <+FingaLights> Claw grip, but it sucks
[3:05:23] <user_naim> Claw it I guess
[3:05:24] <%RyTYoung> Yeah I hate that with control schemes, taking away your movement to do another function
[3:05:27] <%p4ntless> time for claw
[3:05:27] <therealtacopancakes> heal is only item
[3:05:28] <%Jack8274> Legit use Tekken grip when you need to use items ect
[3:05:28] <DianaTheAscian> claw?
[3:05:35] <gulthrax> Woolie is backseating this shiz? praise Umbasa ashyPure
[3:05:36] <%RyTYoung> THE CLAAAW
[3:05:41] <user_naim> Is Tekken fingers the same as the claw?
[3:05:41] <heartlesshealer> oh yeah reggie's a fight boy, he's not used to quick-padding :0c
[3:05:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> Goomba stomp
[3:05:48] <%X2Eliah> Reggie don't swing too much
[3:05:51] <derap41> You can Goomba people
[3:05:56] <CappuccinoGuil> It does in every game?
[3:05:56] <+Grayhammatter> the goombas stomp
[3:05:57] <sothatsprettybrutal> @Manmush oh "beat" thx
[3:05:57] <gulthrax> just like real life
[3:05:57] <kazataca> don't say that woolz, some nearby fights might benefit greatly from using items.....
[3:05:59] <%p4ntless> introduce them to your timbs
[3:06:00] <Josef_Stryker> There's no drop attacks in DeS right?
[3:06:01] <velgaduere> the stagger is what matters when dropping on fools
[3:06:08] <+krispen_wa> ive played so many games that require claw that its basically my default now
[3:06:11] <%RyTYoung> @dianatheascian as in a claw hand shape where you bring your index finger over the controller to push a button and keep your thumb on the left stick
[3:06:13] <%ggbhtg> hit n runs
[3:06:15] <%Jack8274> Claw is thump on dpad, finger on dpad, Middle on trigger
[3:06:16] <morthieus> woolie is Starting to sound like pat
[3:06:33] <+McSoliace> can't target wat you can't see
[3:06:36] <DianaTheAscian> @RyTYoung k
[3:06:51] <%Jack8274> Using Japanese Controls makes camera controls much better too. X on dodge is so much better
[3:07:10] <heartlesshealer> horizontal swipes are good against man-sized enemies
[3:07:13] <ChungusQuest> no lie, Falchion is good stuff
[3:07:18] <derap41> That's half since you started so its not a risk
[3:07:26] <Shishi1205> dodge on x is more intuitive but runing on x isnt
[3:07:29] <Tuna_Can_0> Give em the R1 R1 R1
[3:07:31] <Pookiedaexzile> Oh now the sweeping swings are good woolie. Fucking toothpick
[3:07:34] <gulthrax> tactical roll
[3:07:37] <kazataca> if only reggie had some sort of grinding stone to fully repair durability...
[3:07:53] <heartlesshealer> I'm sure they'll notice whetstones eventually
[3:08:04] <+Masked_Hero_Lucky> That flail is in, like, every game.
[3:08:09] <derap41> They know about it but its not necessary yet

[3:08:23] <Lancaster_H> they know about the stones they literally talked about it

[3:08:36] <Shishi1205> *flail
[3:08:41] <Aydarkzero> with every swing Reggie grows stronger
[3:08:45] <Josef_Stryker> The torch hollows are fucking assholes
[3:08:52] <kazataca> they just said to store the whetstones because they weren't useful
[3:08:54] <DedlokPM> @heartlesshealer They already have and Woolie has already mentioned it to reggie. He is waiting until it is closer to empty to use it

[3:26:00] <%rcand9> dont attempt a parry on low health
[3:26:01] <%Lion_kun> Reggie, when you block an attack, enemies are vulnerable.
[3:26:06] <%Javaa01> You can just block against these guys, your shield is (relatively) strong against fire
[3:26:07] <%DiscoMatador> Reggie has yet to learn the ways of BLOCK
[3:26:08] <%Jack8274> Just Hold L1 all the time, no reason not too
[3:26:12] <CappuccinoGuil> You got the right idea, Reggie
[3:26:14] <BlackermanZX> get your souls the moment you find them

[3:30:00] <%Lion_kun> thieeeef ring
[3:30:02] <Fleet_Admiral_Sakazuki> Mainly for aggro drawing
[3:30:04] <+Deekman> no thief ring

[3:30:11] <Pookiedaexzile> THIEF RING
[3:30:14] <%Lion_kun> thief ring is so OP
[3:30:15] <buster7800> reg is right

[3:30:17] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:30:19] <CappuccinoGuil> Reggie's point is valid
[3:30:22] <PrideOfFiddles> 50 - 50
[3:30:23] <+Hasmeister96> Wouldn't thief ring be better for the stormlands?
[3:30:23] <siamzero94> Eh, reggie needs his grasses on
[3:30:23] <Pookiedaexzile> THIEF
[3:30:24] <+blastyoboots> it's Safety vs Greed
[3:30:26] <%psydaku> did we just start the reggie run?
[3:30:26] <%rcand9> more items early is good
[3:30:26] <BlackermanZX> both things are valid
[3:30:27] <heartlesshealer> it's a playstyle ring
[3:30:27] <DrkJP520> Items better than stealth
[3:30:28] <Equirah> he needs the erbs
[3:30:28] <dundore77> drops are what are giving him the grass which he needs

[3:35:34] <DatAsuna> amazing
[3:35:36] <siamzero94> he could solo this, if only the poor guy wouldn't get backstabbed so often. it's really weird

[3:39:14] <Mangahero18> Reggie REALLY needs to remember to lock on and use his shield.
[3:39:16] <%Lion_kun> why even have a shield?
[3:39:19] <Pookiedaexzile> You know woolies back seat job isn't too shabby

[3:40:46] <Mangahero18> if anything he's getting WEAKER
[3:40:46] <jaygee303> Just take throwables off if you use them as a crutch
[3:40:46] <KeiganOfAstora> Shouold be getting smarter thouogh LUL
[3:40:47] <DatAsuna> As long as you're not paige who only blocks when she two hands and only rolls when she has shield xD

[3:41:16] <+Shoosler> @Zayasu it is for me. every other minute
[3:41:21] <Pookiedaexzile> Does reggie know what that circle on his left hand does
[3:41:22] <Equirah> lies
[3:41:28] <+paladinstarbuster> LIES
[3:41:33] <%CommanderSqueaks> Lies
[3:41:38] <kazataca> LIES
[3:41:42] <%Lion_kun> firebombs are for specific bosses
[3:41:43] <DeathByPoke7> so you need to find a way to throw your sword
[3:41:47] <KeiganOfAstora> YEA Throw the sword at them!
[3:41:57] <resloxxx> Woolie the liar ft. Reggarth the betrayer
[3:41:58] <Mangahero18> Use them to SUPPLEMENT your offense rather than depending on it.
[3:41:59] <%LastHazzerd> "Sustainability" is the word you want
[3:42:00] <+McSoliace> your more vulnerable
[3:42:03] <derap41> Its a tool not a weapon
[3:42:04] <%Javaa01> Firebombs are tools for specific situations, not a general combat option
[3:42:06] <+chiazam> @Zayasu Yeah every once in a while it freezes up for a second
[3:42:09] <Tampaoster> Crazy Talk Woolie edition
[3:42:09] <%rcand9> damage per second sword is hard to beat
[3:42:09] <baavetti> The firebombs won‚Äôt scaleup in damage
[3:42:10] <djblue_shift> woolie the liar
[3:42:11] <BlackermanZX> use the fire sword if you wanna hit hard
[3:42:16] <+doe3879> Please at least experient with Blocking.
[3:42:19] <RetributionP> throwable build
[3:42:20] <JetpackMcQuack> items are dressing
[3:42:20] <Pookiedaexzile> He's thinking like a Thief
[3:42:23] <$Tuskor13> Can I just say Reggie has a really nice accent
[3:42:26] <sileo_patronus> Throwables are not safe in a fight
[3:42:30] <kazataca> kunai throwing can save lives
[3:42:31] <%allups> and fight him good
[3:42:32] <Louie_Salmon> Man Woolie is saying a lot about how to play the game huh
[3:42:33] <%CommanderSqueaks> I foresee Magic in REggie's future.
[3:42:34] <heartlesshealer> if you're panicking, the only [Item] you should do is [Heal]
[3:42:35] <buster7800> and remember your shield exists
[3:42:35] <Pookiedaexzile> Go two hand and no shield
[3:42:38] <%LastHazzerd> D&D rogues are fun tho
[3:42:39] <CappuccinoGuil> YMFAH would like to have a word with you, Woolie
[3:42:40] <user_naim> Woolie the truther stole my lie
[3:42:40] <justlikehumans> ymfah would beg to differ
[3:42:41] <+D4C_Trice> Throwing knives aren't hadoukens Reggie
[3:42:41] <dabeaminator> That's what pyromancer is in DS1 though
[3:42:42] <lil_pudintater9> Juggler secret class
[3:42:42] <Mangahero18> Yea I like Reggies accent too.
[3:42:44] <+McSoliace> ds2 kinda has one
[3:42:46] <+paladinstarbuster> RESIN IS good
[3:42:48] <RetributionP> yeah there is
[3:42:49] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Matt_Cowdery
[3:42:51] <+Exicuren> This is not Naruto that you use knives to stop a combo
[3:42:55] <+ScatterCatt> Woolie, tell him that throwing knives are great for kiting enemies for 1 on 1 fights.
[3:42:55] <KeiganOfAstora> SHIELD
[3:43:01] <DatAsuna> Well, pyromancers kinda count later
[3:43:01] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> Items are for a plan, the exact opposite of a backup plan
[3:43:04] <KeiganOfAstora> Use your damn shield lo
[3:43:08] <CappuccinoGuil> "There's no class of throwing items" yes there is, it's called the YMFAH class
[3:43:12] <%wibbwobbler> yoooo
[3:43:15] <%allups> block also
[3:43:15] <RetributionP> use shield
[3:43:16] <Tuna_Can_0> then throw your sword 4Head
[3:43:22] <BlackermanZX> might as well two hand LUL
[3:43:27] <KeiganOfAstora> Use your shield!
[3:43:29] <%Javaa01> Don't use bomb, use your shield
[3:43:29] <punished_piglor> Dagger is throw sword
[3:43:30] <%allups> block, not even memeing
[3:43:41] <velgaduere> big good rule of thumb: throwables are not for melee combat
[3:43:41] <VJdarkworld> its nice to use items as finishers too, like if theres tiny sliver of HP left
[3:43:44] <+doe3879> woo 1st BLOCK
[3:43:44] <R0DA> Oh man what a coincidence I was just rewatching the stream where woolie was playing the original DeS
[3:43:44] <Pookiedaexzile> USE SHIELD OR BECOME ROLL MASTER
[3:43:54] <%emperordread> RAISE YOUR SHIELD LUL
[3:43:57] <+Shoosler> throw sword, ride on shield, do spineroonis :)
[3:43:58] <Dave_VD> @dabeaminator good to know considering that this is demon's souls
[3:44:02] <OblivionSword1> woolie can you ask reggie why he hardly block
[3:44:04] <Mangahero18> I cant wait to see how long it takes Reggie to figure out the trick to the Boss.
[3:44:07] <%rcand9> LUL
[3:44:08] <punished_piglor> Blocking coddles your flesh and bones. It's like socialism for your body
[3:44:08] <KeiganOfAstora> no range
[3:44:10] <KeiganOfAstora> they're useless
[3:44:20] <justlikehumans> the throwing class is pretty OP, it has the power to exploit boss AI to such an extent that its not even a fight, then you spend 10 minutes throwing a cartload of knives at the boss that doesnt know you exist
[3:44:20] <Shishi1205> Phalanx is going to laugh
[3:44:26] <Pookiedaexzile> Honestly think he might be better using twohanded and rolling
[3:44:26] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:44:31] <KeiganOfAstora> Now you won't have any big power stuff for the boss
[3:44:37] <SolidusA> if you throw bombs youl die from hernia
[3:44:39] <%Th3SmartAlec> phew
[3:44:39] <%allups> im happy whn he runs out of fire bomb cuz he is ganna overcome it and actually progress with blocking
[3:44:42] <kazataca> tough boi
[3:44:44] <%rcand9> reggie you making me nervous
[3:44:45] <DrkJP520> 2 handed swings will not bounce off of shields
[3:44:46] <KeiganOfAstora> Raise your shield

[3:44:46] <@Moobot> 1914 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!

[3:45:04] <derap41> Ostravs is fighting for his damn life
[3:45:06] <Tooniearcade> Shields up
[3:45:11] <ChungusQuest> Rolling is not a good way to close the gap
[3:45:23] <+doe3879> he's fine,
[3:45:28] <+doe3879> just let him die
[3:45:30] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> The way I see bombs is they are for when you really sure of what they are going to do. Like you have run the area in confidence
[3:45:31] <Pookiedaexzile> He's full health now
[3:45:31] <user_naim> Woolie is doing good as a coach
[3:45:37] <VJdarkworld> maybe reggie should become wizard if he wants to throw AOE around Kappa
[3:45:39] <Aydarkzero> he is
[3:45:47] <%Th3SmartAlec> noice
[3:45:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> Make sure you backstab the right person

[3:46:10] <%Th3SmartAlec> FEET PogChamp
[3:46:11] <derap41> Reggarth the BackStabber Strikes again
[3:46:12] <justlikehumans> that flanking manouver
[3:46:13] <velgaduere> Reggie should be familiar with using those feet
[3:46:16] <getsmokedyo> The switch tho
[3:46:17] <ChungusQuest> step turn step turn pivot step tep
[3:46:18] <KeiganOfAstora> go back

[3:47:43] <DatAsuna> ostrava is a good boi
[3:47:43] <Ragnorok64> I wanna see a panic compilation
[3:47:47] <dabeaminator> Does his current shield have 100% resist?
[3:47:50] <derap41> Who needs shields when you can panic roll
[3:47:51] <pjbuster> you're doing great reggie
[3:47:52] <VJdarkworld> backstep POG
[3:47:56] <%RyTYoung> @dabeaminator no
[3:47:59] <justlikehumans> i thought he was ganna go into super parry mode, considering how hyped he was for the reposte animation

[3:50:59] <+Hasmeister96> @RyTYoung Not really. It's more like an intro for Demon's Souls lore before he starts going into specifics for his next videos. Although he does talk a bit about the nature of the Old One
[3:51:00] <%Irridium> LUL
[3:51:00] <+Shoosler> if woolie liked that then I liked that :)

[3:52:02] <%rcand9> use your binocular
[3:52:05] <Shishi1205> Btw you should tell reggie that aiming the camera changes your weapon hitboxes meaning you can miss attacks because of it. Paige struggles with that a bit sometimes @WoolieVersus

[4:01:14] <%allups> i think reggie would rather be fast
[4:01:27] <%rcand9> the defence is pretty negligible though to be honest for most armour
[4:01:31] <buster7800> YAAAYY
[4:01:32] <+chiazam> Does item burden effect rolling?
[4:01:32] <CappuccinoGuil> The full armor would be OVER 50% weight capacity
[4:01:38] <CappuccinoGuil> @chiazam no

[4:04:15] <derap41> Helmet with the old shield would work
[4:04:18] <KeiganOfAstora> You can get the pants
[4:04:23] <%rcand9> reggie just buy grass bro
[4:04:25] <CappuccinoGuil> If you swap the shield, you can get the helmet
[4:04:25] <buster7800> waaay too heavy
[4:04:27] <Louie_Salmon> Armor like barely matters though
[4:04:31] <buster7800> just buy grass
[4:04:32] <glass_marcus> Start Grazing son
[4:04:33] <DrkJP520> Once you can level up, you can increase your equip burden to be able to wear heavier shit and still fast roll.
[4:04:36] <+chiazam> Put the helmet on and take something else off
[4:04:40] <KeiganOfAstora> I think that'd be just at 49.9
[4:04:48] <+Rekinsinn> same defense as well
[4:04:48] <%emperordread> I like my builds how I like my milk - Full Fat

[4:05:21] <+chiazam> They're the same
[4:05:21] <KeiganOfAstora> no benefit to them tho
[4:05:22] <CappuccinoGuil> Plate Greaves probably has better slash damage
[4:05:23] <%Irridium> which one do you think looks cooler
[4:05:25] <+AwkwardSnails> just for fashion
[4:05:28] <%X2Eliah> Pfft ahahahahaha

[4:14:45] <%rcand9> mando is the best
[4:14:46] <Vibe__Lord> TRUE#
[4:14:46] <KeiganOfAstora> I'm only 4 episodes in
[4:14:46] <Louie_Salmon> Except the ending
[4:14:49] <Ookamiden02> it's pretty good
[4:14:50] <+cvp5127> thats not hard
[4:14:51] <%Lion_kun> except the ending
[4:14:51] <Pookiedaexzile> Low bar
[4:14:53] <+reallybigrocks> Fuck Mandalorian is great
[4:14:53] <%Juriasu> season 2 is great but best is kind of hyperbolic
[4:14:55] <%rcand9> the ending is amazing
[4:14:58] <justlikehumans> i need to check that show out at some point
[4:14:58] <Pookiedaexzile> That's a real low bar
[4:15:03] <DatAsuna> It's good but that's people undertaling it
[4:15:04] <%Lion_kun> the ending is fan wank
[4:15:07] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I'm fine with the ending
[4:15:07] <+Ether101_Prime> The ending is the big thing for season 2.
[4:15:07] <USOtaku> The end of Season 2 is great
[4:15:10] <Dante_Namikaze1> That ending is great
[4:15:11] <%wibbwobbler> season 1>season 2
[4:15:11] <Ookamiden02> the bar is pretty low
[4:15:12] <DianaTheAscian> did Woolie ever watch clone wars?
[4:15:13] <%MattDemers> Has Reggie raised his stats yet? Or is that not a thing in DeSe
[4:15:15] <BaslerJones> the star wars bar has been lowed to the ground so
[4:15:16] <%Seancicle> what do we drop?
[4:15:17] <%allups> its one of the best starwars things imo
[4:15:17] <CappuccinoGuil> nice
[4:15:17] <Zaphire_Saucypants> It's pandering, but I still love it.
[4:15:19] <Dakuu75> thanky ou messages

[4:16:22] <%Lion_kun> Woolie promised to be a passive voice but he sure has been gripping Reggie's hips pretty hard
[4:16:23] <PrideOfFiddles> Curved swords in general have low durablility
[4:16:35] <%Lion_kun> it's almoat like Pat was right
[4:16:38] <%Graxe_> Curved swords aren't that durable to start with, yeah
[4:16:39] <%Lion_kun> almost*
[4:16:44] <%rcand9> no one wants to see poor reggie fail

[4:33:55] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1341285307048730624?s=19
[4:33:55] <alvaroeltz> LOOK AT THE TOP OF HIS HEAD
[4:33:56] <%allups> demon souls is an online game??
[4:34:02] <CappuccinoGuil> PUT THAT SOUL AWAY
[4:34:04] <jorniev> PRESS R1
[4:34:14] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> All souls are online
[4:34:25] <Bluewolf544> Her boobs got a buff but the feet got a slight nerf, Negotiable as a good change
[4:34:29] <buster7800> give that to Thomas
[4:34:29] <tewodros11> This reminds me of prince of persa
[4:34:32] <+Hasmeister96> Don't you have to give the lead demon soul to a blacksmith?
[4:34:34] <ActingKing42> @WoolieVersus enjoying this version? and its nice to catch a live stream
[4:34:41] <brianthe12th> Maiden of Black boobification
[4:34:43] <%Lion_kun> Make a scraping spear
[4:35:01] <+Vancoolness> Look at all these chickens
[4:35:02] <+chiazam> @allups It always was
[4:35:04] <+vaderxyz1970> Maiden of Thiccness
[4:35:06] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[4:35:07] <+eanscrale> The weapon for this is something you will become very acquainted with.
[4:35:09] <%rcand9> LUL
[4:35:10] <%superc37> scraping spear is kinda useless in pve tho
[4:35:14] <derap41> The Boss is more of a puzzle than a fight
[4:35:15] <CappuccinoGuil> @Hasmeister96 You can use it from the chest like all upgrade materials
[4:35:17] <Crashfan01> don't tell him shiiiiit
[4:35:22] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> Spill the beans!
[4:35:22] <Bluewolf544> PogChamp
[4:35:25] <CappuccinoGuil> @derap41 pretty much every boss is like that
[4:35:32] <%rcand9> my boy reggie is learning
[4:35:43] <%jiggy_snipe> Reggie is gonna make a scraping spear and become his true evil self
[4:35:43] <derap41> @CappuccinoGuil One thing I really like in Demons compared to the others
[4:35:44] <+chiazam> @derap41 Most of them are
[4:35:58] <%superc37> @cappuccinoguil eeeh penetrator and false king arent tbh
[4:36:09] <+Hasmeister96> @CappuccinoGuil Yeah but I swear that you have to give a blacksmith a demon's soul in order to get their services or something?
[4:36:10] <%Axle13j> And hit them from behind
[4:36:20] <KeiganOfAstora> It's not fast
[4:36:26] <siamzero94> stone wall
[4:36:26] <KeiganOfAstora> That's the easy part
[4:36:32] <%Javaa01> DeS is pretty half and half for gimmick bosses and real bosses
[4:36:34] <+Aeoneth> meatwall
[4:36:35] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> It's a good first boss for training
[4:36:35] <Daniel_Is_I> They turtle up and try to get you when you come in
[4:36:36] <VJdarkworld> the wooden shield
[4:36:37] <%Th3SmartAlec> you know what I mean?
[4:36:37] <Crashfan01> know what I mean
[4:36:39] <+Masked_Hero_Lucky> The blacksmith needs a red hot demon's soul
[4:36:43] <+reallybigrocks> The opposite of a glass cannon is goo with a shield
[4:36:47] <+eanscrale> That's really important in this game
[4:36:47] <dundore77> I think they made it so they leave the body much more often and made them less aggressive. i remember tons of thrown spears and they never left the body.
[4:36:55] <%LastHazzerd> good job reggie!
[4:36:58] <+chiazam> @CappuccinoGuil yup thats right
[4:37:03] <+Hasmeister96> @masked_hero_lucky So Flamelurker's?
[4:37:04] <%Jack8274> Well done, you learned a lot of good habits!

[4:50:16] <lotharrio> Most cheating cheaters.
[4:50:17] <%Jack8274> Not cheating, just exploiting.
[4:50:19] <%Javaa01> Though granted, you can earn infinite souls legit because of that luck bug
[4:50:22] <clack14> how do you list infinity
[4:50:28] <%Lion_kun> wait, how can you cheat on a console?
[4:50:29] <+kewlmyc> Yeah, the gold coin exploit
[4:50:32] <%superc37> @matt_cowdery well yeah, des is where it came from.
[4:50:32] <derap41> That looks legit
[4:50:32] <Louie_Salmon> To be fair, you don't actually have to cheat for infinite souls
[4:50:33] <+mMayrro> not like its hard to break this game LUL
[4:50:35] <+NanoComputer> exploitation is cheating
[4:50:35] <VJdarkworld> @matt_cowdery it plays a big roll in this game LUL
[4:50:36] <%SomeSageAdvice> @Matt_Cowdery yeah its where it originates
[4:50:38] <KeiganOfAstora> First Completion?
[4:50:38] <ChungusQuest> just call this whole place the House of Duras
[4:50:39] <%rcand9> big cheater

[4:50:52] <clack14> Cheat the world.
[4:51:01] <%RioGascar> you might be able to sequence break it??
[4:51:02] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> I would like to know more
[4:51:03] <%rcand9> always cheat unless it counts
[4:51:15] <dabeaminator> Breaking za law, breaking za world
[4:51:15] <%linSP> glad they kept the hall of cheaters
[4:51:22] <fuji_92> see them feet
[4:51:23] <+eanscrale> And they say cheaters never get ahead
[4:51:24] <%allups> i mean leader board are other players but its not really a core part of the game
[4:51:24] <clack14> you don't really care if you aren't cheating
[4:51:25] <%RioGascar> but i would gather most progression ties require killing a boss

[4:54:43] <Aussie_Manny> Only basic bitches go STR and DEX. :P
[4:54:47] <CappuccinoGuil> Vit is also Item burden
[4:54:55] <KeiganOfAstora> It shows it on screen
[4:54:55] <dabeaminator> I get the feeling Woolie would be way into the Sisters of Battle from warhammer.
[4:55:02] <mihokspawn> @MrPedrovsky unrimited bRade woLks

[4:55:23] <DSD24> Unlimited Lost Works
[4:55:26] <%Jack8274> Get stronk
[4:55:26] <user_naim> Are there quality builds in DeS?
[4:55:33] <Pookiedaexzile> DEX
[4:55:40] <+xemnahort> @user_naim yes
[4:55:44] <%allups> big strong
[4:55:50] <user_naim> @xemnahort cool
[4:55:50] <%Lion_kun> In lster games, HP goes up no matter what stat you pump but only increases more with pure vit.
[4:55:50] <+Masked_Hero_Lucky> So Reggie, fast small damage or slow big damage
[4:55:51] <mihokspawn> @user_naim there are, but single ones are better
[4:55:54] <+fizzguy47> bloodtinge
[4:55:57] <huskarl_zap> des is the only game that has quality build weapons
[4:56:01] <VJdarkworld> health stamina POG
[4:56:02] <%CommanderSqueaks> Woolie that's not what dump stat means, but okay.
[4:56:03] <%rcand9> more vit and stam never hurt anyone
[4:56:04] <Solidnick18> more stamina more swings
[4:56:04] <Ookamiden02> Vit also raises equip load
[4:56:05] <+xemnahort> @user_naim you can even make some weapons scale with decent and strength
[4:56:10] <Blank9> 1 str for that bastard sword would be fun
[4:56:11] <CappuccinoGuil> Nah, pop 'em
[4:56:12] <+xemnahort> *dex
[4:56:12] <%Lion_kun> Des has the cleaver, the ultimate quality weapon
[4:56:17] <crimsonsaens> Stamina has a softcap though
[4:56:19] <Dakuu75> it's only a waste if you lose um~
[4:56:21] <Equirah> that's not what dump stat means LUL
[4:56:21] <user_naim> thanks
[4:56:22] <+chiazam> Is he building a STR character or a DEX character
[4:56:23] <Pookiedaexzile> DEX
[4:56:26] <Darren716> DEX
[4:56:27] <BaslerJones> min max PogChamp
[4:56:29] <fuji_92> str or dex?
[4:56:30] <buster7800> DEX
[4:56:30] <dabeaminator> Dump stats are the ones you ignore because you don't need them for your build.
[4:56:31] <clack14> big dumps
[4:56:32] <lotharrio> So much dex...
[4:56:32] <+matteasy31> Strength gang
[4:56:33] <$Invlux> He's got the spirit that's what matters LUL
[4:56:37] <Pookiedaexzile> DEX!
[4:56:37] <derap41> That's armor related
[4:56:42] <%Jack8274> Armor would help too
[4:56:42] <CappuccinoGuil> Magic and Faith should be 10 if you want to talk to the trainers
[4:56:43] <%Lion_kun> no Reggie, no
[4:56:45] <venomfury86> STR or DEX
[4:56:46] <+Masked_Hero_Lucky> You only want to level faith and magic if you're going to be casting
[4:56:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> Woolie, DUMP STAT is the stat that is pointless, Vitality and Endurance are the opposite of a DUMP STAT.
[4:56:47] <+NYCrownlessKing> generally you build dex/str based on the weapon you WANT to use, so check any other weapons in the inventory @WoolieVersus
[4:56:47] <crimsonsaens> You can get spells right away if you want
[4:56:49] <%rcand9> magic defence isnt important
[4:56:52] <+Left_Justified> INT 1 4Head
[4:56:52] <%Lion_kun> you don't spread points, you specialize
[4:56:52] <%Javaa01> Don't round out too much, there's no benefit in becoming a sphere statistically
[4:56:54] <buster7800> Your weapon wants DEX
[4:56:56] <Lancaster_H> DOKAPON 2: ELECTRIC BOOGALOO
[4:57:01] <+kewlmyc> If he wants to go strength, picking wanderer was a weird choice
[4:57:02] <Pookiedaexzile> DEX is what would increase his damage
[4:57:07] <+NYCrownlessKing> generally you build dex/str based on the weapon you WANT to use, so check any other weapons in the inventory @WoolieVersus ~
[4:57:08] <+eanscrale> You can, but it takes a while
[4:57:14] <%Jack8274> Like Luck, never touch luck
[4:57:15] <+HodouVAN> isn't a "dump stat" the opposite? a stat you deliberately ignore, or "dump?" unfamiliar
[4:57:16] <%Lion_kun> dex or strength depending on what weapon you're going for
[4:57:17] <lotharrio> Put an eye on what leveling up does for your weapon power.
[4:57:18] <Pookiedaexzile> DEX
[4:57:22] <+Left_Justified> LUCK PogChamp
[4:57:22] <Dakuu75> Lucky-faith~ Kappa
[4:57:22] <%rcand9> dont fuck up your build
[4:57:34] <%Tsunamidusher> Just wanna remind everyone.. Reggie took out Phalanx on TRY ONE
[4:57:34] <%RyuuAoi> Is Reggie gonna be a Wizard?
[4:57:35] <%Jack8274> @HodouVAN Dump as in fill, not dump as in break up with
[4:57:36] <Equirah> @HodouVAN yup LUL
[4:57:37] <%CommanderSqueaks> Now it's time to pull a Pat and spend 20 hours calculating your build.
[4:57:46] <CappuccinoGuil> What kind of weapon do you wanna use, reggie?
[4:57:48] <+megaman_sentinel> go quality
[4:57:51] <%Lion_kun> go for a cleaver build and spread it between strength and dex
[4:57:52] <KeiganOfAstora> don't think about it like that
[4:57:53] <LunarRemix> Or anti-magic armor
[4:57:59] <%Lion_kun> Reggie, never touch faith.
[4:58:02] <+Masked_Hero_Lucky> Well look at your defenses, they went up levelling your other stats
[4:58:02] <crimsonsaens> There are OP anti-magic shields in this game
[4:58:04] <%rcand9> ignore magic unless you want to use it
[4:58:04] <jorniev> does the LUCK thing still works!?
[4:58:04] <+eanscrale> You need dump stats in these games
[4:58:14] <redrins> dont think about defense unless you're talking equipment
[4:58:18] <%Kev1n36> has anyone ever actually been killed by phalanx tho
[4:58:21] <%allups> I think he wants to cast spells from rang
[4:58:22] <%rcand9> magic is not important unless you are harry potter
[4:58:24] <%Lion_kun> the best defense is don't get hit
[4:58:27] <lil_pudintater9> Just pump stats that make you hit hard
[4:58:30] <Dakuu75> what about a bloodborne-build... hat uses NO-shield, is that a thing?
[4:58:32] <%Lion_kun> you never will
[4:58:33] <BlackermanZX> not right now
[4:58:40] <CappuccinoGuil> Reggie won't use any magic until Magic 10. You DON'T find spells in the game, only buy them
[4:58:45] <+McSoliace> magic is very good tbf
[4:58:49] <Blank9> 10 is good to stop with on magic
[4:58:52] <+worldbrand> all-rounding IS viable in demons souls
[4:58:53] <Pookiedaexzile> SEXDEXSEXDEX
[4:58:55] <+eanscrale> quality builds are still great for first playthroughs right?
[4:58:58] <VJdarkworld> reggie must use exact build i did when i played the game saintrReee saintrReee saintrReee saintrReee
[4:59:03] <derap41> 12 str means bastard sword
[4:59:04] <%Lion_kun> magic is broken but if he was gonna use magic, he should have picked a royal build
[4:59:07] <%RyuuAoi> Pump Dex and Endurance
[4:59:09] <%rcand9> reggie just wants a fireball woolieKICKDAD
[4:59:11] <+NYCrownlessKing> generally you build dex/str based on the weapon you WANT to use, so check any other weapons in the inventory @WoolieVersus - upgrade weapons are the priority for building dmg
[4:59:12] <%allups> thats what i mean by is it even worth to spec into magic
[4:59:12] <%CommanderSqueaks> Bumping Magic up to 10 is the threshold for starting to use magic in this game, I believe.
[4:59:36] <Pookiedaexzile> STRENGTH IS NOT DAMAGE UP
[4:59:37] <Johannen> He already has 1 magic memory, that any good?
[4:59:40] <+wydamn> Don't listen to anyone else in chat, PUT IT ALL INTO LUCK
[4:59:45] <%allups> but yeah Reggie wants to toss spells i think
[4:59:47] <CappuccinoGuil> @allups he's showing interest in magic, and in this game you can't even look at magic until magic 10
[4:59:53] <%Jack8274> @Pookiedaexzile It's a little damage, he isn't using a sharp weapon yet
[4:59:57] <dabeaminator> @Pookiedaexzile It is if your weapon scales with strength.
[5:00:02] <%RyuuAoi> Reggie hasn't tossed a spell yet.
[5:00:06] <BlackermanZX> you could pop a soul in your inventory
[5:00:09] <Blank9> add 1 magic so he can try it, but stop there
[5:00:10] <crimsonsaens> @Johannen Not without being able to learn spells, no
[5:00:13] <+megaman_sentinel> yes
[5:00:21] <+matteasy31> First souls PogChamp
[5:00:22] <+NYCrownlessKing> if Reggie wants to talk to the magic npc, he needs at minimum 10 magic @WoolieVersus
[5:00:24] <%CommanderSqueaks> Magic at 10 will unlock Magic for Reggie, so he can try it.
[5:00:32] <%Lion_kun> Quality build baby
[5:00:33] <dundore77> Also some dex weapons do need some strength to be able to carry them
[5:00:34] <%allups> @CappuccinoGuil ight thanks i only played DS3
[5:00:34] <%rcand9> quality builds arent great
[5:00:35] <Pookiedaexzile> I'm making sure, he knows, I made that mistake for half a playthru
[5:00:38] <+NYCrownlessKing> there is a magic npc in the area atm @WoolieVersus
[5:00:40] <sendart> 1 str lets him use the bastard sword
[5:00:41] <Pookiedaexzile> Back when des first came out
[5:00:41] <CappuccinoGuil> Magic 10 is good, Woolz. It unlocks the magic trainer
[5:00:44] <%Lion_kun> Now he can wield that bastard sword
[5:00:49] <buster7800> we goin quality my dudes
[5:00:56] <%Lion_kun> CLEAVER CLEAVER CLEAVER
[5:00:58] <+HodouVAN> honestly aside from the magic thing it's pretty hard to mess up a build permanently at this level is the important part i think
[5:01:02] <lotharrio> Quality builds. Kreygasm
[5:01:06] <%Lion_kun> DOUBLE S SCALE BITCHES
[5:01:07] <KeiganOfAstora> GET A LONG SWORD
[5:01:07] <user_naim> q u a l i t y
[5:01:10] <+cvp5127> go to 4-1 LUL
[5:01:12] <CappuccinoGuil> @allups all good, it's the reason they put spells as items in DS1, so it'd incentivize players to try them.
[5:01:14] <+HodouVAN> unless he dumped all the levels into one stat and that stat was luck he could make something work
[5:01:16] <+eanscrale> 40dex 27str TWO HANDS
[5:01:22] <+megaman_sentinel> the quality build
[5:01:22] <buster7800> long sword! long sword!
[5:01:24] <Johannen> Time for trying out new weapons?
[5:01:24] <%thedankestmeeme> dude she is SO HOTTT
[5:01:25] <dabeaminator> If magic is its own stat what does intelligence do?
[5:01:34] <CappuccinoGuil> @dabeaminator amount of spell slots
[5:01:41] <%Jack8274> Talisman of beasts with low stats, cursed weapon build hehe
[5:01:42] <CappuccinoGuil> @dabeaminator also, MP and MP regen
[5:01:48] <lotharrio> 261 I think.
[5:01:48] <%Lion_kun> he could always go for a blueblood if he's dumping it on luck
[5:02:01] <%Lion_kun> hey chat remind me, the moonlight greatsword is a faith weapon in this game?
[5:02:02] <+HodouVAN> it's not that different from DS1-3 having Intelligence and Attunement as different stats
[5:02:03] <Pookiedaexzile> Magic caliber, Int is magazine size
[5:02:03] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1341285307048730624?s=19
[5:02:07] <thedankestmeeme> Id plug a baby in that girl MMPH
[5:02:08] <Shishi1205> yes
[5:02:09] <+NYCrownlessKing> if reggie wants see magic - minimum requirement to speak to the magic spell npc is 10, he's 9 atm @WoolieVersus
[5:02:11] <crimsonsaens> @Lion_kun correct
[5:02:18] <@akuda_bar> @thedankestmeeme bruh
[5:02:19] <+Bail_seven> woolie has become pat
[5:02:25] <%Lion_kun> which is weird because it's an int weapon in dark souls
[5:02:35] <%thedankestmeeme> too far?
[5:02:43] <crimsonsaens> @Lion_kun It also doesn't shoot lasers in this game
[5:02:46] <Blank9> magic, magic
[5:02:49] <MrPedrovsky> Are you just kneel to lick her toes, while you level up? Asking for a friend...haha
[5:02:50] <CappuccinoGuil> Being able to pop multiple souls at once is Kreygasm
[5:02:52] <BlackermanZX> maybe put 1 point in magic?
[5:02:53] <venomfury86> wait, where are you?!
[5:02:57] <+matteasy31> touch the demon Kreygasm
[5:02:57] <%Jack8274> Weapon upgrades?
[5:03:15] <CappuccinoGuil> Let him get Magic 10 to unlock spells, Woolz
[5:03:16] <+megaman_sentinel> 10 magic
[5:03:16] <%Lion_kun> put 1 point in magic if you want to experiment with spells
[5:03:24] <VJdarkworld> so the world might be mended saintr2EZ
[5:03:34] <Pookiedaexzile> Lets play this out, He tries magic once, gets bored and goes back to hitting things
[5:03:40] <velgaduere> smart boi
[5:03:44] <%Jack8274> I do love low vit players in PVP though. One shot baby
[5:03:45] <+matteasy31> PogChamp
[5:03:47] <KeiganOfAstora> good move for first runs
[5:03:48] <+eanscrale> vit is always first
[5:03:48] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[5:03:49] <%rcand9> stamina for is always important even if you make mistakes imo
[5:03:50] <Pookiedaexzile> we lose 1 hour of our lives
[5:03:54] <Ner234> Mistakes are being made LIVE on stream LUL
[5:03:55] <huskarl_zap> spell casters Kreygasm pastaThat
[5:03:57] <Frostilk> I feel oddly nostalgic for the symbols being utter nonsense LUL
[5:03:57] <lloyddboy> just don't get hit tho
[5:03:58] <KeiganOfAstora> Always bump your health so you don't die as often and can actually play the game
[5:03:58] <%Jack8274> Level 1 done!
[5:04:02] <$Invlux> noooooo
[5:04:04] <%jiggy_snipe> LUL LUL
[5:04:04] <+kewlmyc> DAMN REGGIE
[5:04:05] <%Javaa01> Oh and repair your shit
[5:04:08] <+chiazam> Go jump off a ledge
[5:04:11] <derap41> She always sounds a little disappointed
[5:04:13] <+CptBritches> Reggie lmao
[5:04:16] <%Lion_kun> shhhh
[5:04:17] <%ChoculaUltra> that is a cool floor
[5:04:17] <velgaduere> poor skeet face FeelsBadMan
[5:04:18] <$Invlux> do NOT call her that LUL
[5:04:20] <%Lion_kun> he might forget next session
[5:04:21] <user_naim> eventually the stamina gets kind of pointless, cause 1-2-dodge fixes everything
[5:04:24] <+matteasy31> LUL
[5:04:24] <%Jack8274> Skeet the yeet
[5:04:26] <%rcand9> great job reggie

[5:04:31] <%Jack8274> THAT FACE IS WHAT I WANTED!
[5:04:32] <%ChoculaUltra> the clapping, gosh Reggie is too pure LUL
[5:04:32] <%allups> skeet face lmao

[5:04:45] <OblivionSword1> Reggie you did a great job
[5:04:46] <%jiggy_snipe> is Reggie a nice guy, I'm not so sure anymore lol
[5:04:48] <+matteasy31> Man I'm jealous. First souls. :D
[5:04:49] <derap41> 9 death not bad
[5:04:52] <Frostilk> True innocence Reggie LUL
[5:04:52] <%allups> he did a dmeon souls
[5:04:55] <alroy900> this is gonna be a good lp
[5:04:59] <%CptnCampy61> That was super good
[5:05:03] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> I really wish I could relive this, Reggie have fun!
[5:05:05] <Solidnick18> you did very good reggie
[5:05:05] <clack14> woolie senapi
[5:05:10] <Crashfan01> poop zone hype!
[5:05:10] <+zzNamttamzz> Reggie you are amazing SeemsGood
[5:05:11] <VJdarkworld> hai
[5:05:13] <%Jack8274> You did amazing dude, congrats
[5:05:13] <%ekodrop> nerbs
[5:05:15] <%rcand9> reggies first souls game
[5:05:15] <venomfury86> YOU NEVER FORGET YOUR FIRST TIME
[5:05:15] <djblue_shift> that was a great run
[5:05:19] <YakumoYomi> „ÅäÁñ≤„Çå
[5:05:24] <+xemnahort> Reggie is kind of adorable
[5:05:28] <Pookiedaexzile> Yo is that Yo Yo's first Hoodie?
[5:05:30] <%Lion_kun> this is honestly a really bad game to do once a week
[5:05:31] <OblivionSword1> reggie did better than we thought
[5:05:32] <KeiganOfAstora> Onegaishimaaaaas
[5:05:35] <%allups> weebs
[5:05:37] <venomfury86> Reggie did great
[5:05:37] <%Lion_kun> he's gonna forget shit
[5:05:46] <+McSoliace> did you do a sync test in the beginning?
[5:05:54] <djblue_shift> reggie did fucking fantastic
[5:05:56] <dabeaminator> Reggie VS starts now
[5:06:01] <clack14> it's really nice :)
[5:06:02] <%Jack8274> you can see the hooks are in
[5:06:05] <%falineth> falineth subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months!
[5:06:05] <%Lion_kun> it's the easiest one
[5:06:17] <Storm_Samurai> Where you get that pixel clock
[5:06:17] <+Masked_Hero_Lucky> Woolie, tell Reggie this is the easiest souls game
[5:06:18] <tattleworm> it is fair
[5:06:18] <user_naim> Reggie did super. Good enough to impress, but also entertaining stumbles
[5:06:25] <%ekodrop> it's not as cruel
[5:06:26] <%Javaa01> It seems brutal, but once you see through the obfuscation, it's by far the easiest
[5:06:31] <Blank9> Yeah Reggie's doing fantastic
[5:06:32] <Pookiedaexzile> This is the Easy one
[5:06:34] <%thedankestmeeme> ok i'll leave
[5:06:37] <+matteasy31> Can't wait for the bloodborne run PogChamp
[5:06:45] <%rcand9> most bosses are puzzles
[5:06:50] <dundore77> It also has things that other games dont have.
[5:06:51] <DedlokPM> @Storm_Samurai Minh got it for him along with the pixel art for Woolie's birthday
[5:06:53] <%jiggy_snipe> IP holder is different
[5:06:55] <%Lion_kun> In terms of difficulty I' say Sekiro>Ringed City>Old Hunters>Bloodborne>DS3>DS2 DLC>DS2>DS1>Demoms
[5:06:55] <%cobalt_phoenix_> im dying to see him do bloodborne, if he does it
[5:07:00] <venomfury86> brutal but satisfying
[5:07:02] <%Javaa01> Yeah Sony owns DeS
[5:07:10] <BlackermanZX> Also Bloodborne
[5:07:11] <crimsonsaens> Bloodborne was supposed to be DeS 2 though
[5:07:20] <CappuccinoGuil> Next time Reggie should fool around with some magic
[5:07:23] <lotharrio> Uhmf, that Bloodborne.
[5:07:32] <OblivionSword1> BamCo own DS right ?
[5:07:34] <KeiganOfAstora> Beast Souls
[5:07:36] <fangovafang> wat up everyone LuvPeekL
[5:07:44] <Pookiedaexzile> He really Roleplayed the out of his element cagey Wanderer
[5:07:45] <%CommanderSqueaks> What is the nature of this Stand?
[5:07:51] <%Javaa01> @OblivionSword1 Bamco is the publisher
[5:07:52] <DedlokPM> @OblivionSword1 I believe so. They at least publish it
[5:07:53] <%Lion_kun> you don't know difficulty unless you fight father owl or orphan of kos
[5:07:57] <%Jack8274> That's the fighting game mentality, ara ara good boy Reggie
[5:08:05] <venomfury86> Bloodborne is the best, right Plague? LUL
[5:08:11] <Shishi1205> Orphan is straight up a fucker
[5:08:17] <+Cozy90> YOURE HUBRIS
[5:08:19] <clack14> - why mashing is bad -
[5:08:19] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @lion_kun fuck both of those fights
[5:08:30] <%CommanderSqueaks> You must be humbis.
[5:08:42] <%wibbwobbler> never let your guard down
[5:08:42] <%Lion_kun> there's a pacing to these games that you need to sync with
[5:08:47] <%Lion_kun> once it clicks, they're easy
[5:09:07] <huskarl_zap> gagled
[5:09:07] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[5:09:08] <%Lion_kun> also barring that grind until you're super huge
[5:09:13] <Solidnick18> it be like that
[5:09:19] <%Lion_kun> then you don't have to play good
[5:09:25] <Pookiedaexzile> No Trick, Peasant Guard, Sword Novice
[5:09:34] <fangovafang> The Surge was a nutty souls like
[5:09:40] <Pookiedaexzile> RunSlinger
[5:09:46] <derap41> Just don't "Grind a little"
[5:09:47] <+Deekman> watch Woolie
[5:09:52] <%Lion_kun> Sekiro was super hard at the start but that clicked eventually and now I can rush through shit that took me hours the first time.
[5:09:57] <%Jack8274> That was what what I wanted
[5:09:58] <%jiggy_snipe> like its 09 again
[5:10:00] <%allups> grind off screen
[5:10:02] <%Valask> Valask subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! I'd argue DeS relies on you having preconceived notions more than other Souls games, and other souls games rely on your own preconceived notions of them
[5:10:09] <user_naim> not blind tho
[5:10:12] <CappuccinoGuil> @derap41 he probably won't since he only plays during recording sessions
[5:10:12] <+JustToWatch> Reggie next week "so I grinded a little off screen"
[5:10:14] <user_naim> cant say that
[5:10:18] <venomfury86> "Souls games are not hard, you're just not good at them yet" -Noclip
[5:10:24] <derap41> @CappuccinoGuil Was making a joke
[5:10:26] <%allups> do a little griding off screen
[5:10:36] <+Frazzyfraznor> That was fun to watch. You're a good teacher
[5:10:36] <+Grim1952> Reggie, play dark ssouls in the meanwhile lol
[5:10:41] <%Lion_kun> he should lab a little off screen or he'll lose his rhythm
[5:10:42] <%CommanderSqueaks> "So I did a little grinding."
[5:10:42] <%allups> just a little tho
[5:10:44] <CappuccinoGuil> @derap41 you know what?!?! Fair enough, good joke
[5:10:45] <Pookiedaexzile> That game had such hard execution

[5:11:15] <nailwind> Reggie's steps to greatness
[5:11:16] <+matteasy31> ONE GUY LUL
[5:11:19] <+chiazam> ONE GUY
[5:11:19] <Pookiedaexzile> You did good
[5:11:19] <+worldbrand> You did good woolz
[5:11:20] <%rcand9> you did great woolie
[5:11:20] <Solidnick18> LUL
[5:11:21] <Shishi1205> it was fine
[5:11:23] <user_naim> Woolie was great
[5:11:23] <PrideOfFiddles> SeemsGood Fantastic stream
[5:11:26] <lotharrio> Guide his hips, Woolie.
[5:11:27] <+yukichocomilk> it was good
[5:11:29] <user_naim> Woolie IS great
[5:11:30] <%Lion_kun> I was kidding Woolie, you did a great job
[5:11:30] <%jiggy_snipe> good job on the boss
[5:11:32] <Crashfan01> Woolie did great
[5:11:32] <dundore77> You are spoiling anything for him so far just tips of what he already did
[5:11:32] <BlackermanZX> nah it was pretty good
[5:11:32] <+chiazam> The guiding was JUST right
[5:11:33] <Johannen> Definitely not a "one guy" situation
[5:11:34] <%velemi> PAT
[5:11:36] <@akuda_bar> woolie's commentary was........ perfect woolieDATTEBAYO
[5:11:38] <dabeaminator> Yeah PAT
[5:11:38] <+Deekman> how hard is it to not say "drop your shield"?
[5:11:41] <dundore77> aren't****
[5:11:43] <AnneSQF> I think you both did great
[5:11:43] <%RyuuAoi> Everything is fine. Reggie doing better than I thought!
[5:11:47] <venomfury86> Reggie, you did great
[5:11:52] <derap41> That shit doesn't matter you can beat the game with a busted character
[5:11:54] <%RyuuAoi> No, Woolie. Let him fail!
[5:11:58] <%Lion_kun> I apologize if I offended you Woolie, you're a good teacher"
[5:11:58] <fangovafang> Salt&Sanctuary vibes lol
[5:12:08] <Pookiedaexzile> *If you know the game in and out
[5:12:09] <OldManDeckardCain> "little dagger" KappaPride
[5:12:09] <+McSoliace> it was more like "Three Guy"
[5:12:11] <dabeaminator> If Pat's in the room, you MUST use a greatsword str build.
[5:12:13] <Pookiedaexzile> down to frame data
[5:12:13] <BlackermanZX> just
[5:12:14] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Naked and barefisted
[5:12:15] <DedlokPM> @akuda_bar at least 5 times perfect psaWhat
[5:12:15] <%Jack8274> Soul Level 1 runs are the best
[5:12:16] <+zzNamttamzz> it was specifically at the ball trap before the dragons
[5:12:21] <BlackermanZX> git g o o d
[5:12:25] <%CommanderSqueaks> No, you must spend 5 hours online with a stat calculator to determine the PERFECT build. psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[5:12:27] <%jinking79> psa3guy
[5:12:30] <derap41> Its very hard to ruin a character
[5:12:35] <%allups> yeah if u grind a little ull be fine lol
[5:12:38] <+Grim1952> Guiding the build is not backseating
[5:12:39] <%jiggy_snipe> just give him some general pointers
[5:12:42] <dundore77> "the build" doesn't really matter if you honestly fucked up the build just grind more it really isn't that huge a deal.
[5:12:44] <Louie_Salmon> ...but what if you could have fun more optimally
[5:12:49] <%Lion_kun> ds2 and 3 let you respec, ds1 and bloodborne do not
[5:12:49] <%RyuuAoi> You gotta commit now!
[5:12:50] <%rcand9> magic is very powerful
[5:12:52] <velgaduere> LUL
[5:12:52] <venomfury86> honestly, i think Woolie is a better coach than Pat
[5:12:57] <lotharrio> Apparently you'll need 1 more point in magic to even have a chance to do stuff.
[5:13:05] <fangovafang> Don't feel bad lol dats where I'm at wit ashen
[5:13:06] <%CommanderSqueaks> Optimize the fun out of your fun.
[5:13:07] <nailwind> Woolie's beasting as the guide, good work you two
[5:13:09] <%RyuuAoi> @venomfury86 A lot calmer ha
[5:13:09] <clack14> my fun is the best fun PunOko
[5:13:12] <royb2> @venomfury86 not much required for that lol
[5:13:12] <%superc37> god it is so stupid how they didnt add respec to this game
[5:13:14] <%jiggy_snipe> yea messing up your build just leads to some grinding time
[5:13:15] <%Jack8274> @WoolieVersus You can remove stats by invading if you don't like them
[5:13:17] <%Jack8274> You can restat
[5:13:18] <+Grim1952> Maximize the fun
[5:13:20] <Solidnick18> hmmm
[5:13:27] <+Deekman> nah Pat'll do that for you on the next porcast
[5:13:34] <Lancaster_H> @venomfury86 not wrong, but reggie is also way better than woolie was at the start of DS2
[5:13:37] <Blank9> 2 points in str vs dex for a katana's still just gonna be like 5 damage less, it's fine
[5:13:38] <clack14> the porecast
[5:13:39] <%Jack8274> You can remove them by dying by envoirment while invading, it takes away the last level in the order you leveled
[5:14:04] <Shishi1205> 4-1
[5:14:17] <venomfury86> @lancaster_h that's true
[5:14:23] <lotharrio> Hoping for a spear build.
[5:14:25] <+Grim1952> Just explain how scaling works
[5:14:25] <derap41> Move set matters more than stats
[5:14:36] <+Frazzyfraznor> Does he know about world tendency?
[5:14:37] <%Valask> WEEB SOULS
[5:14:45] <Johannen> Moveset over Stats
[5:14:49] <%jinking79> Wat's a Map
[5:14:49] <%RyuuAoi> @frazzyfraznor Yea
[5:15:07] <Blank9> Yeah, push stats towards movesets you like
[5:15:08] <%Zero_Jacks> as i watch Pat and peach play ds2 i get Wools and Reg now. nice
[5:15:14] <Pookiedaexzile> How do you like ToothPicks Reg?
[5:15:21] <%rcand9> des has a lot of good weapons
[5:15:47] <%allups> and even looks cooler
[5:15:57] <Johannen> Halt on coommitingto leveling before you find what weapon you like

[5:19:04] <CappuccinoGuil> Latria was already great and this version is just JAWDROPPING
[5:19:14] <%Lion_kun> like the music
[5:19:21] <%superc37> a lot of the redesigns and remixs suck ass
[5:19:43] <%superc37> especially since theres no option to switch to the older versions
[5:19:43] <%ozzrabbit> just watch VaatiVidya after the game is over for the full lore dump
[5:19:45] <venomfury86> Latria Kreygasm
[5:19:55] <%wibbwobbler> bloodborne has the best plot imo.
[5:20:07] <Pookiedaexzile> You dont miss

[5:23:49] <DianaTheAscian> jumping is a nightmare
[5:23:57] <%Jack8274> Then the pinnacle of gaming "Dark Souls 3". Still never beaten
[5:24:00] <DizzyDeazy> Souls games take me back to my younger days when you really didnt know shit about a game and everything was about discovery. From the world to the mechanics
[5:24:05] <CrimsonGargoyle> @Pookiedaexzile you're in the know, right? LUL
[5:24:12] <+paladinstarbuster> In Ds2 if you jump off a step stool you'll explode
[5:24:14] <lil_pudintater9> @Pookiedaexzile bloodborne was a rude ass wake up call
[5:24:15] <CappuccinoGuil> DeS has far better build variety than Bloodborne, though

[5:24:56] <%Lion_kun> all the good bloodtinge and arcane weapons were in the second half of the game
[5:25:08] <venomfury86> Demon's Souls and DMC started something amazing
[5:25:19] <lloyddboy> If someone is telling you how to be black is that Blackseating?
[5:25:29] <%CommanderSqueaks> oh no
[5:25:32] <CrimsonGargoyle> LUL
[5:25:45] <%Lion_kun> you can play with magic without tanking your build
[5:25:52] <Lancaster_H> @lloyddboy no that's Twitter
[5:25:56] <%Lion_kun> he just needs one point in magic
[5:26:04] <CappuccinoGuil> Reggie's char has 9 Magic, so it'd be 1 point
[5:26:08] <Johannen> Extra 5 points of damage is realy worth it over trying out new things on the first run)
[5:26:09] <Shishi1205> Soul arrow is that good
[5:26:09] <+worldbrand> Fix your build by grinding for a little bit for more stats, the level cap is absurd
[5:26:19] <%Javaa01> Yeah in DeS entry level spells are really good even pretty late into the game, so you can dip your toe
[5:26:26] <Pookiedaexzile> "You're not a Wizard, Reggie"
[5:26:31] <%jiggy_snipe> well in DeS it was broken lol
[5:26:34] <RyanGelatin> wizardous
[5:26:35] <siamzero94> magic is stinky
[5:26:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> Mages are Blankas in Demon's Souls.
[5:26:59] <%CommanderSqueaks> Don't look at them, don't shake their hand.
[5:27:11] <Pookiedaexzile> Dark Souls has better Mage shit
[5:27:14] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Combustion
[5:27:14] <%Javaa01> And don't let them sprint at you
[5:27:14] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> Magic as a backup is my plan
[5:27:15] <Shishi1205> No runing casting
[5:27:16] <Pookiedaexzile> and by mage shit I mean Pyro
[5:27:20] <%Javaa01> Because that Firestorm is coming

[5:28:04] <%Tsunamidusher> As a sorcerer in all demons souls titles, this game is definitely the most fun, next to DS2. Never played it cheap, just learning dodging was a MUST
