[0:01:42] <waltzqueen> Static Shock was great
[0:01:52] <vavilonica> It's a history of omages and parodies
[0:01:53] <miucsa51> I miss static BibleThump

[0:04:08] <%A_German_spy> @waltzqueen Oh, hey! Funny seeing you here
[0:04:09] <+ItsSansom> Was thinking during the video content he's getting through the Burg with little resistance
[0:04:16] <+DiscouragedOblong> if it's snowing, the entire city is fucked
[0:04:22] <%ozzrabbit> Just put the cables underground like the do in Germany. It works for them ^^
[0:04:25] <+Bailey__Gaming> Let Loose with Lovecraft
[0:04:31] <+kevlarkoala> i've been reading the manga, how far behind am I?
[0:04:31] <Xaeveax> I love the rambles before the game starts. Helps set the mood.
[0:04:35] <@Solidus_113> Elden RIng lookin NICE
[0:04:42] <@Solidus_113> I'm glad the Murakumo is back
[0:04:43] <%A_German_spy> Pho can be fantastic if it's made right.
[0:04:43] <waltzqueen> @A_German_spy saw reggie souls and instantly detoured from my other stream.
[0:04:44] <daemonazaezal> theres a place called pho king near my house
[0:04:46] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> that dragon fight looked SICK

[0:06:57] <%mr_sups> Delete his firebombs again Woolie
[0:07:10] <ds3namecaldara> They are amazing in pvp
[0:07:11] <%Lion_kun> Firebombs one shot asylum
[0:07:15] <+eanscrale> They're used for speedrunning in fact
[0:07:18] <%mr_sups> You can get his hammer that way
[0:07:23] <+ItsSansom> Taking firebombs as a blessing and using them on Asylum is a legit strat
[0:07:24] <Dopamien> blind yeeting fire bombs is so much fun
[0:07:27] <Melchior_the_Wise> firebomb speed run asylum
[0:07:27] <@Solidus_113> using black firebombs on that first fight without a weapon you get a real nice STR hammer
[0:07:29] <Treasure_Vault> Starting with black firebombs let you kill the asylum demon first time you see him for a huge hammer.
[0:07:30] <royb2> Firebomb only run
[0:07:49] <+mechslayer71> has woolie already seen the elden ring gameplay?
[0:07:49] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:08:01] <+ItsSansom> Oh Woolie, you know all about crutches in Souls games
[0:08:05] <ds3namecaldara> Resin buffing getting you killed

[0:08:19] <%Supermonaman> Supermonaman subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months, currently on a 17 month streak! Been a while since I could watch live. Looking forward to seeing Reggie playing more of this awesome game. Also I'm really looking forward to Elden Ring but have decided not to look at any gameplay before it comes out. Love your stuff.
[0:08:19] <%CateHecate> Capra demon perched on reggies windowsill with his two machetes saying "shh, im comin bak"
[0:08:28] <%dmbender> All this talk about Dark Souls has me wanting to start playing. I've only got DS3 atm, should I just jump into it or start back with DS1?
[0:08:34] <%glaciomaniak> just got back from watching the gameplay trailer, elden ring is gonna be absolutely amazing
[0:08:40] <+cubbywolf> get gud
[0:08:46] <+ItsSansom> @dmbender Go for the full trilogy run
[0:08:52] <+kevlarkoala> @dmbender DS1 is my personal favorite but DS3 is just flat out better
[0:08:55] <Omentus> magic dex my favorite build
[0:08:58] <%Luzasaywa> Luzasaywa subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! l oklmmm
[0:09:05] <ds3namecaldara> yes Elden Ring is dark souls 4 and I can't wait
[0:09:06] <%glaciomaniak> @dmbender I'm replaying ds1 with reggie
[0:09:06] <dashrendar7> I saw the Elden Ring Collectors Edition too
[0:09:06] <agustorm123> Elder ring THO
[0:09:21] <pi_in_the_sci> Elden Ring looks like the most amazing PS3 game ever
[0:09:24] <%BallerSwagBro9k> If im allowed by Woolie im preping to invade Reggie later on. It will be very memorable
[0:09:28] <+TheOlMitcheroo> I'm holding out too
[0:09:43] <BigYanno> is it time for some Sark Douls?
[0:09:45] <%Indigo_Automaton> It's podcast material
[0:09:49] <+kevlarkoala> eh I looked at it because like...I've played every souls game, I know what it looks like haha
[0:09:51] <+ReallyBigRocks> It's gonna be so vague and obtuse that trailers aren't gonna spoil anything
[0:09:56] <+mechslayer71> @pi_in_the_sci it looks way better on the high resolution non stream borked footage
[0:09:57] <%cobalt_phoenix_> cobalt_phoenix_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months! You got this Reggie!
[0:09:59] <LiquidBinge> DS3 is the better Video Game™, but I still enjoy playing DS1 mo
[0:10:00] <+cubbywolf> that's a bad idea because I am about to spoil all the gameplay for you... eventually
[0:10:10] <AvroEltz> People NEED to talk about it
[0:10:21] <+cubbywolf> content
[0:10:27] <Johannen> Reggie the Best Boi
[0:10:29] <Equirah> talk about what?
[0:10:39] <KeiganOfAstora> Does he? Does he really tho?
[0:10:44] <+cubbywolf> gameplay teailers
[0:10:49] <oda_flobunaga> DS3 feels better to play but DS1 has much more diverse and risky enemy and encounter design
[0:10:59] <%Necnill> LUL
[0:11:03] <+cubbywolf> the pros LUL
[0:11:04] <agustorm123> Te quiero mucho Reggie
[0:11:10] <BigYanno> even if he doesn't have it now he will have it eventually. He's still very early
[0:11:15] <%Necnill> As a treat
[0:11:20] <Crowroost> as a treat
[0:11:21] <ds3namecaldara> just Pre ordered Elden Ring
[0:11:21] <+patriotrenegade> As a treat
[0:11:21] <%Indigo_Automaton> Free throwing firebombs in DS3 is where it's at
[0:11:22] <+cubbywolf> that guy will.be one guy soon
[0:11:29] <+blink289> Wherever you go just respect the darkmoon gang
[0:11:30] <+cubbywolf> damn phone
[0:11:31] <Treasure_Vault> The worst parts of DS3 are way better than the worst parts of DS1. I'd rather play through DS3.
[0:11:34] <sendart> hiding in a corner and chucking bombs
[0:11:36] <%glaciomaniak> glaciomaniak is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to WoolieVersus's community! They've gifted a total of 1 in the channel! 
[0:11:37] <%glaciomaniak> glaciomaniak gifted a Tier 1 sub to lord_campbell96! 
[0:11:39] <pi_in_the_sci> @mechslayer71 I have no doubt that it's a crisper image, but that lighting is 10 years old
[0:11:46] <+askalta> Elden reggie
[0:11:46] <ds3namecaldara> yo ds3 bombs feel good to throw because they have a constant arc
[0:11:49] <%CappuccinoGuil> Consumibles are a bell curve. Casual players use them a lot, pros use them precisely because they know the math. 10 bombs to kill this boss or 20 minutes fighting them?
[0:11:59] <LunarRemix> No one uses that area
[0:12:00] <fruit_pie_the_magician> But you're a pyromancer you make firebombs from your hands
[0:12:03] <%CateHecate> DS3 has the issue where its so polished but because it assumes most players will know all its tricks it just plays a bunch of dirtier tricks than usual, which just ends up making me not like it. Anytime i go back to DS3 i just realize I absolutely hate playing through like 80% of all the areas
[0:12:12] <BigYanno> I've never ever seen anyone use that area
[0:12:14] <@Solidus_113> do you mean the official option?
[0:12:18] <Crowroost> Old Watchdog of Farron
[0:12:22] <+mechslayer71> @pi_in_the_sci I disagree, especially in that bit where they're creeping through the forest
[0:12:26] <@Solidus_113> yeah no one uses that
[0:12:29] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus That's just because nobody uses the dedicated PvP area, because it's not great.
[0:12:37] <+Sullen_Walrus> nobody uses that area they use the area 10 feet past that area lol
[0:12:40] <+cubbywolf> brush off your copy and hunt down reggarth chat
[0:12:41] <Johannen> The Forest?
[0:12:45] <+kevlarkoala> @CateHecate some of that isn't noticeable UNLESS you've played the rest of the games. Like, it's only tricky for old timers and not for new comers haha
[0:12:49] <LiquidBinge> I only put hands on DS2 all of one [1] time after playing DS3 first and DS1 second, and it felt so gross.
[0:12:55] <+askalta> all the pvp is the oolcaile bonfire right outside the arena
[0:12:58] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I've gotten to the point in DS3 where I literally just run through the first 65-70 percent of the game in roughly 45 minutes
[0:13:04] <+cubbywolf> pvp watchdog?
[0:13:05] <LiquidBinge> I know it's got some good stuff, but the controls make me heave.
[0:13:13] <BigYanno> how often were you human though?
[0:13:19] <@Solidus_113> I got a single invasion when I played last night in blighttown
[0:13:19] <+twohitgood> the r/darksouls community is doing their "Return to Lordran" event so you should see some online interactions.
[0:13:19] <ds3namecaldara> Ds3 goes for the kill but I can't get ds1 to strangle me anymore
[0:13:23] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Based on what?
[0:13:30] <@Solidus_113> no watchdog on
[0:13:31] <+eanscrale> Most people who do pvp in 1 are probably in the DLC area
[0:13:36] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Kappa Kappa Kappa
[0:13:43] <+cubbywolf> what's watchdog?
[0:13:44] <+ItsSansom> Don't want another Woolie Watcher situation. More of a Kurt Cobain situation
[0:13:45] <$FusRoDom> Reggie needs to meet his Curt Cobain
[0:13:47] <%CappuccinoGuil> I mean, you saw summon signs last time, so I'm assuming it's working properly?
[0:13:50] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Im gonna go csbeastB csbeastE csbeastA csbeastS csbeastT on Reggie
[0:13:53] <%CateHecate> DS1 is just relaxing for me to play at this point, its a chill game that I can throw on, go for a weird build i havent done before, go through as far as I want to go through before i get bored
[0:13:54] <+ReallyBigRocks> @twohitgood oh no, redditors LUL
[0:13:56] <%sonofthedeepsouth> I want 40 invasions per minute people
[0:13:56] <LiquidBinge> Woolie Watcher was so cringe
[0:13:57] <%dashrendar7> dashrendar7 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! I have loved your YouTube content and the podcast for a long time, finishing Demon Souls play through right now, cool to see this one live thanks Woolie and Reggie
[0:13:57] <+Freakin_Wolfy> having a bad day? Just picture a cow in your head and rotate it! It's not illegal, they can't stop you.

[0:14:23] <+tempestzephyr> Woolie says "Use protection"
[0:14:23] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Sure thing. I'll be around.
[0:14:42] <+cubbywolf> is it a mod other people need to have installed to connect to you?
[0:14:43] <Johannen> There are totaly still inavders this early on
[0:14:47] <%ChoculaUltra> the DS3 pvp scene is going strong, even more so if you get a bunch of dudes running Cinders
[0:14:52] <NateyBeak> @KeiganOfAstora me and a pal got our save files destroyed by a guy in ds2. infinite binoculars :CCC
[0:14:52] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:14:53] <ds3namecaldara> ds3 is getting dead people are just moving on or playing solo
[0:15:01] <%Lion_kun> Funnily, the most coop/invasions I ever did was ds2
[0:15:04] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Short answer is, people just don't use the dedicated PvP arena, but they do still invade elsewhere.
[0:15:09] <%sonofthedeepsouth> I want Reggie to not to be able to move an inch withput an invasion alarm. Its all a boy ever wanted.
[0:15:22] <+cubbywolf> the mp of souls always confuses me
[0:15:28] <BigYanno> souls LP's are a real time investment and they can start off painfully slow, but they're almost always a great time
[0:15:33] <+kevlarkoala> @ds3namecaldara both. but with the community restarting DS1 right now, they'll move on to DS3 soon to beat it before Elden Ring comes out
[0:15:38] <%livlinn> oop, right on time oldgrayWave
[0:15:41] <lotharrio> Yo Franz
[0:15:46] <+cubbywolf> skipping ds2?
[0:15:53] <+eanscrale> A lot of the community did get split on PC when the remaster came out initially.
[0:15:53] <LiquidBinge> You should bring Spy in on a call like when you ran OG Demon Souls
[0:15:57] <%ChoculaUltra> I always wondered how chaotic Sekiro would've been with invasion based pvp LUL
[0:16:04] <+ItsSansom> ds connectivity mod?
[0:16:04] <+cubbywolf> I've been meaning to play ds2 remastered
[0:16:05] <%glaciomaniak> never played DS2 but kinda don't want to
[0:16:06] <%A_German_spy> @lotharrio charly23Hi
[0:16:15] <+twohitgood> Elden Ring definitely has ds3 and sekiro elements mechanics-wise. looks great.
[0:16:24] <$eco419> I think he won’t get invaded because he got the Black knight sword that pumped his soul lvl
[0:16:24] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Mmmm
[0:16:31] <Xaeveax> @glaciomaniak DS2 is very good, minus a few really dumb design choices
[0:16:33] <KeiganOfAstora> BIG
[0:16:35] <+kevlarkoala> @glaciomaniak DS2 is a weird game in the franchise, but it's a great game outside of it. It's not bad, it's just kind of a bad Dark Souls if that makes sense
[0:16:40] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Can I have it without the KappaPride neon?
[0:16:41] <%livlinn> do the ahegao Reggie! oldgrayExcited woolieKICKDAD
[0:16:49] <Deasmeister> @glaciomaniak it has some fun bosses but also some puzzling design decisions
[0:17:02] <pennykettle_> yea can I get a PC boneless
[0:17:10] <+cubbywolf> pre built is the only way to get gpu these days
[0:17:16] <xjn_> lobosHype lobosHype lobosHype
[0:17:16] <%thesickestzak> Can I get a pc with extra bones then?
[0:17:16] <wantedsafe471> oh, they're playing ds1 remastered? I forgot it had that stupid weapon level matchmaking
[0:17:18] <@Solidus_113> I'm really excited to see how Woolie's PC handles Blighttown on stream, because there's like 3 small transition doors where my game still dropped to single digit fps
[0:17:18] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Les go
[0:17:18] <KyberNasse> Top tier builds from Artesian Builds
[0:17:23] <fruit_pie_the_magician> DS2 at least doesn't feel incredibly unfinished in any of it's areas
[0:17:24] <LiquidBinge> Oh no Reggie got Mike Wazowski'd
[0:17:24] <+patriotrenegade> KILL KILL KILL
[0:17:36] <LiquidBinge> Sticker over his face

[0:17:57] <%livlinn> is this LP running on the Absolute Unit(TM)?
[0:18:00] <photoniccaster> Does the watchdog kick people with ENB shaders?

[0:18:38] <%hiswill98> It’s at this point as a coach where I let go of who I’m coaching. There are many paths after Gargoyles  so I usually let the player I coach discover what they discover
[0:18:41] <%sonofthedeepsouth> 9
[0:18:42] <zzNamttamzz> Butterfly or Capra, who will be today's nemesis?

[0:18:52] <fruit_pie_the_magician> DS2 just feels like they had 2 almost entirely finished games and had to hack them together. Continuity gets kind of fucked, but the game itself doesn't feel slapdash like some places in DS1 I could mention

[0:21:03] <%Lion_kun> He is in every Dark Souls game
[0:21:04] <AvroEltz> I killed him for fap early 1 time, all the other ones i leave to chase him in anor londo, otherwise the game gets too easy
[0:21:05] <+mechslayer71> 3 probably has the best crestfallen
[0:21:09] <+cubbywolf> crestfallen

[0:22:50] <BigYanno> oh man he's really low level
[0:22:57] <JinJun1738> 😔
[0:22:58] <Crowroost> "Look Yulia, a pig-man."
[0:23:09] <%Indigo_Automaton> He needs 18 Dex for the BKS right?
[0:23:09] <%Lion_kun> The hub themes of all the games are so good
[0:23:10] <+ItsSansom> I remember Woolie having ridiculous luck with BK weapons and gear. Would be great if Reggie gets the same
[0:23:10] <newbthenovicegamer> crazy watching woolie coach someone while im currently watching him get coached by pat. circles, man
[0:23:11] <%Luzasaywa> ok I'llll you@bippityjones
[0:23:19] <%Lion_kun> I can never pick a favorite

[0:23:41] <%jepupu> How far is Reggie now? Always gotta go to bed before the stream end
[0:23:42] <AvroEltz> Clean up the merchant, forever
[0:23:43] <+mechslayer71> @itssansom he already did. chunk and sword on first one
[0:23:44] <BigYanno> buy his uniques then murder him? Sounds like a plan to me
[0:23:48] <$hattrick61> "clean him up" you say
[0:23:48] <%illtima> Reggie doesn't forgive or forget
[0:23:48] <+Shishi1205> he did have a cakewalk during gargoyles so yeah he didn't have to farm
[0:23:55] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @jepupu killed bell gargoyles
[0:23:58] <pennykettle_> I don't think any part of DS1 feels like you're required to be any level
[0:24:02] <tigerfang86> Dex boisssssss
[0:24:03] <%jepupu> Alright
[0:24:08] <+TheOlMitcheroo> HE GOT DAT TAIL

[0:24:21] <Crowroost> nooooo not the drake sword meme

[0:25:40] <+ItsSansom> @KeiganOfAstora Oh man... flashbacks

[0:25:57] <+Rafraud> Get in their face tbh
[0:25:57] <Vaardvark> parry the hand

[0:26:12] <nailwind> YEYE
[0:26:13] <%ChoculaUltra> LUL
[0:26:13] <+extradopeness> pats kinda got the poopoo brain
[0:26:13] <%Josef_Stryker> LUL
[0:26:14] <warpiscute> was reggie told about counter damage?
[0:26:14] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus He was right. You have to be RIGHT up in the enemy's face to follow through on a riposte. You also have to be within a roughly 90° frontal cone of the target.
[0:26:14] <%CoffeeKaiju> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[0:26:17] <royb2> no need to rush the R1
[0:26:19] <Treasure_Vault> The merchant also sells a Buckler with more parry frames, but a longer recovery
[0:26:21] <WakeUpThrow> Reggie's parry timing is SeemsGood
[0:26:23] <newbthenovicegamer> no im the fool!
[0:26:24] <AvroEltz> can be, i always face fuck the black knights
[0:26:24] <scrambledxeggz> what did I miss?
[0:26:33] <Crowroost> rat boi rat boi
[0:26:37] <brunoberserk> and also , this a awful shield for parry
[0:26:39] <%ChoculaUltra> you wanna be in smooch range
[0:26:42] <nailwind> jermaChomp
[0:26:47] <+extradopeness> nothing against the guy; we love pat
[0:27:13] <pennykettle_> I want a mod that lets you play as Bloodborneman in Dark Souls
[0:27:15] <wantedsafe471> Heater shield best shield. good stats, good fashion, and decent parry window
[0:27:25] <royb2> @pennykettle_ exists for Dark souls 3
[0:27:37] <yomamma133713> @A_German_spy hes not talking about the riposte, just the parry itself
[0:27:41] <KeiganOfAstora> Yea Heater Shield is best for most of the game if you upgrade the stability too
[0:27:44] <nailwind> @pennykettle_ with how nuts Dark Souls: Nightfall is looking to be, it might happen
[0:27:45] <KellBeII> @brunoberserk all medium shields have the same parry frames and in ds1 they're more than adequet
[0:27:46] <+Shishi1205> R2 one handed tho :eyes:
[0:27:47] <pennykettle_> @royb2 I know it adds some of the weapons and stuff but did it add gun parrying and the dashing?
[0:27:50] <Johannen> Balder shield has the same parry window as all other mid shields no? So its fine for parrying
[0:27:52] <Treasure_Vault> Yeah, Reggie might be more comfortable learning with the heater shield. Better for parrying. Or get a buckler for training wheels.
[0:27:56] <%CateHecate> @wantedsafe471 on my most recent playthrough i also discovered, Heater has literally the same stability as dragon crest, thats insane LUL
[0:27:57] <KeiganOfAstora> If you can get a Black Knight Shield that's great. Silver Knight Shield is 2nd best
[0:28:00] <+liquidzr0> reggie's character sounds like he has coins in his pockets
[0:28:02] <%Indigo_Automaton> B I G
[0:28:09] <AbnormalVoid> Fuckin' Massive Mate
[0:28:16] <%jepupu> 2-hand if you wanna get past the turtling
[0:28:19] <+extradopeness> does this game have a WAPing system
[0:28:23] <pennykettle_> I would also take a mod that lets me bulletjump as a Warframe around Lordran LUL I want to just wall jump up into Anor Londo
[0:28:23] <QueequegTheater> QueequegTheater subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 27 months! It's very heartwarming to see Woolie carrying on the spirit of Soulsborne LPs by mixing objectively wrong advice in with occasional correct things.
[0:28:23] <Karhax> chainmail legs are really loud
[0:28:26] <+eanscrale> Yeah the claymore is super popular in this game for good reason
[0:28:30] <WakeUpThrow> Reggie's character sounds like he's *made* out of coins
[0:28:42] <+ItsSansom> Super impressed with how far Reggie's come so far since DeS
[0:28:44] <BigYanno> ehhh I'm not sure fukin huge is right. It's big, but later weapons will show you what real huge means
[0:28:47] <daemonazaezal> MURDER
[0:28:50] <daemonazaezal> SLAY HIM
[0:28:51] <Xaeveax> I don't think he's even discovered the best part of the claymore yet (spin to win)
[0:28:52] <%Solidnick18> KILL
[0:28:53] <pennykettle_> nyehehhehehe
[0:28:56] <DapperCadavr> hcjSickos
[0:28:58] <Karhax> you have plenty of time to riposte, if you are super legit you can even switch weapons to your dagger
[0:28:59] <algi80> never hurts to splurge
[0:29:03] <Crowroost> Evrart PLEASE
[0:29:03] <wantedsafe471> HUHR QUEST
[0:29:03] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1455421207659139081?t=Np244HCpRXfSBOkB2__Gpw&s=19
[0:29:05] <%DashXero> Y'all are kill-happy.
[0:29:08] <+extradopeness> let ya nuts hang
[0:29:09] <MegaApple18> LUL LUL LUL
[0:29:09] <+kewlmyc> He's a nice skele-bro, don't kill him.
[0:29:09] <@Solidus_113> Dried Finger is good to get
[0:29:10] <warpiscute> dried finger is essential
[0:29:18] <HkxantII> Yes, kill
[0:29:19] <+patriotrenegade> theyre only good for mimics
[0:29:20] <bippityjones> Sad Boiz & Bri'ish Gigglin'
[0:29:22] <+ItsSansom> Dude sounds so much like Evrart
[0:29:27] <royb2> @pennykettle_ The Hunter vs Sister friede on youtube, looks like it.
[0:29:28] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Yeah, after you land a parry, you have a moment to step closer to the enemy and readjust your position for the riposte. You actually have time to switch your weapon to both hands first, too. Gets you a little more riposte damage with STR-scaling weapons.
[0:29:34] <+kewlmyc> @ItsSansom Fuck, I can't unhear it.
[0:29:34] <@Solidus_113> get the dried finger and like 80 more arrows
[0:29:36] <wantedsafe471> kill him, for yuria
[0:29:44] <BigYanno> seems to me like this guy is prime for a murderin
[0:29:45] <daemonazaezal> if reggie doesnt kill him this time ill be major disappointed
[0:29:45] <Treasure_Vault> Get a buckler!
[0:29:52] <+ItsSansom> "Mr Undead.. Mr Undead!" *snaps fingers*
[0:29:56] <Crowroost> MISTER DUBOIS i assure you, Yulia is very much real,
[0:29:56] <Johannen> Andre has a Mace
[0:29:57] <Treasure_Vault> The buckler has a different parry animation. It's worth trying for learning parries.
[0:29:57] <+TheFrancix> what's upp guys
[0:30:00] <pennykettle_> @royb2 oh damn!
[0:30:03] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @daemonazaezal
[0:30:03] <BigYanno> he has the morning star right?
[0:30:05] <%Prowtellen> Or they're good against everything like in DS2 LUL
[0:30:05] <+patriotrenegade> @pennykettle_ Cinders does that. You get guns and dashing.
[0:30:11] <Lode1> Cheer500 Silly question, but what would you think a Dark Souls Pinball machine would look like?
[0:30:17] <QueequegTheater> Reinforced is straight up better
[0:30:19] <%Indigo_Automaton> Reinforced has bleeding
[0:30:24] <+ItsSansom> "Ah yes, I've got my best people out there looking for your lost humanity"
[0:30:33] <%cobalt_phoenix_> reinforced is way better
[0:30:34] <daemonazaezal> theyre literally the same but one has bleed
[0:30:35] <KaiserMario> Reinforced does bleed too
[0:30:35] <Karhax> reinforced is better overall i think
[0:30:37] <+TheFrancix> WE UNGA BUNGA
[0:30:37] <+Shishi1205> amor londo pin ball
[0:30:40] <%jepupu> Level your strength up like crazy more like
[0:30:42] <+foomaster22> Reinforced gives bleed though
[0:30:42] <%dreadedcthulhu> how does a club make you bleed
[0:30:44] <cheapdoc> Goblin Slayer approves
[0:30:44] <wantedsafe471> reinforced = SL1 run
[0:30:45] <bippityjones> Mr.Dubois, I assure you we'll find your missing gun. !FRENZY!
[0:30:49] <KeiganOfAstora> Reinforced has less durability
[0:30:51] <QueequegTheater> If you were for some reason committing to strength, but using fast weapons
[0:30:52] <+Grayhammatter> don't we already have a morning star?
[0:30:55] <@Solidus_113> bleed doesn't matter for skeletons
[0:31:00] <Crowroost> "I'm going  to unionize all the Hollows, it'll be great."
[0:31:01] <Johannen> ^
[0:31:02] <WakeUpThrow> "Mr undead is helping me find my lost uchigatana"
[0:31:04] <KellBeII> theyre both fine really
[0:31:13] <%dreadedcthulhu> morningstar is pierce right?
[0:31:14] <+Shishi1205> Is it better? what about scaling
[0:31:14] <+kralec> Reinforced club has bleed on it, right?
[0:31:18] <Treasure_Vault> @Solidus_113 This is the truth.
[0:31:23] <Darren716> Oonga bonga
[0:31:27] <+ItsSansom> Evrart Merchant is my new favourite character
[0:31:42] <pennykettle_> Link the first flame, usher in the age of darkness, or fuck off
[0:31:46] <QueequegTheater> Reinforced is objectively the best weapon for SL1 runs because putting lightning or fire on it removes all scaling anyway but it retains the bleed
[0:31:55] <%CateHecate> really weird that the club that is "reinforced" is LESS sturdy LUL
[0:31:57] <Dopamien> SMOrc big stick do big damage
[0:31:57] <nailwind> gobo slayer sends his regards

[0:32:06] <+ItsSansom> @pennykettle_ I mean, the third and second are sort of the same

[0:32:30] <+patriotrenegade> yes
[0:32:35] <@Solidus_113> repair box is way cheaper than the powder
[0:32:37] <warpiscute> i was pleasantly surprised by how fair sl1 in this game is when you just use the lightning reinforced club
[0:32:42] <+patriotrenegade> you can never have enough arrows
[0:32:46] <wantedsafe471> Well it's damage is reinforced, not it's sturdyness
[0:32:58] <Dopamien> repair powder makes you fabulous
[0:32:58] <daemonazaezal> 999 is the riight answer
[0:32:58] <KeiganOfAstora> regular arrows will do fine

[0:37:47] <algi80> I'm learning good tactics from Woolie
[0:37:48] <@Solidus_113> he also gives you the residence key if you didn't buy it
[0:38:09] <Crowroost> Enough with the Drake sword meme, please oh god
[0:38:11] <nailwind> @covo375 enjoy the ladder arc

[0:38:13] <pennykettle_> tfw I will never get lost in Lordran again FeelsBadMan
[0:38:14] <elshadow7> Did he buy the repair box and key?
[0:38:23] <QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus He can upgrade the uchi to have comparable damage to the drake sword literally right now
[0:38:24] <daemonazaezal> That noise happens when 2 sound effects get played with milliseconds of eachother
[0:38:36] <daemonazaezal> Love how fucky some of the old game tech is
[0:38:44] <+covo375> Look at this boys swagger moving through zones
[0:38:44] <QueequegTheater> The drake sword is a fucking meme that needs to die
[0:38:50] <HkxantII> There’s no point in the drake sword
[0:38:54] <%Indigo_Automaton> Wait doesn't he have the key to lower undead burg now?
[0:39:03] <HkxantII> He does
[0:39:04] <%CateHecate> how far in the game do we think it will take to get canon reggarth? we got canon woolington halfway through anor londo, im predicting something similar
[0:39:05] <@Solidus_113> oh someone survived
[0:39:05] <elshadow7> Why not use souls?
[0:39:06] <daemonazaezal> He does i believe
[0:39:06] <Treasure_Vault> Did Reggie miss a couple lizards and/or shinies directly before and after the minotaur?
[0:39:06] <Johannen> You dont have to shoot him you can use the same trick with the bridge
[0:39:07] <buerdo> I cut the tail with the wooden club’s two handed R2, i was very surprised
[0:39:13] <pennykettle_> wtf 😡 I remember that being +555 souls for the bridge clear
[0:39:14] <daemonazaezal> Forging at andre
[0:39:15] <%haitakaa> reggie gettin that tail Kappa
[0:39:16] <wantedsafe471> Might as well ignore the Drake sword. noob weapon
[0:39:28] <algi80> in Prepare to Die you could kill the drake with arrows, but they fixed it in the Remaster
[0:39:34] <miucsa51> LUL
[0:39:37] <AvroEltz> Drake sword is cool just to have, but fuck having to shoot the arrows, i'll run in that bridge and rip that tail with my own hands if i need to
[0:39:39] <Crowroost> We could be rescuing Griggs and turning Reggarth into a Chad sorcerer right now
[0:39:40] <Darren716> I mean it's still worth it to get the drake for content
[0:39:41] <sendart> drake sword is pointless if he plans to upgrade the claymore lol
[0:39:43] <QueequegTheater> But Woolie will make sure to massively overstate dangers to add extra fear
[0:39:48] <HkxantII> Reggie does need to actually upgrade tho before he does more stuff imo
[0:39:50] <elshadow7> I remember you could stand atop the tower where the black knight is and kill the drake with 1 arrow.
[0:39:53] <@Solidus_113> time to lame it out
[0:39:57] <+ItsSansom> Aight guys, see you back here in 10 mins
[0:39:59] <%CateHecate> i think my favorite part about dark souls 1 is that you can really feel that its kind of held together with duct tape, it makes it so, so charming
[0:40:04] <nailwind> get some tea, chat
[0:40:06] <@Solidus_113> 10 minute piss break
[0:40:10] <daemonazaezal> The drake sword is a meme
[0:40:17] <wantedsafe471> yep, 10 minute break
[0:40:17] <Crowroost> 10 minutes? With Reggie's aim? lmao
[0:40:19] <pennykettle_> @CateHecate agreed, I love this game with all my heart

[0:40:58] <%glaciomaniak> it took me like 30 something arrows I think
[0:40:59] <%cobalt_phoenix_> if reggie figures out how to hit the tail on when it's on the bridge, this goes way faster

[0:41:28] <blackostream> LUL
[0:41:28] <%cobalt_phoenix_> just turn a bit to hit it
[0:41:28] <QueequegTheater> Can YOU? No.
[0:41:29] <+kewlmyc> I'm going to laugh my ass off if they run out of arrows, after they've killed the guy you can buy arrows from.
[0:41:32] <AbnormalVoid> Drake Sword is alright if you can upgrade it
[0:41:32] <someyounguy1> bowmaster reggie?
[0:41:35] <pepinillomaton> There is NO WAY he has enough arrows
[0:41:37] <%Solidnick18> nah
[0:41:39] <%Bread_Assassin> We can talk shit about the anime onlys now.
[0:41:40] <+ItsSansom> Oh god don't waste arrows
[0:41:42] <+TheFrancix> 10 minutes later
[0:41:45] <toulon_somberjade> 30 regular arrows for me, I bought 200 and managed to cut the time by getting double hits
[0:41:46] <nailwind> was hoping for Reggarth to comedically step on a banana peel off the ledge
[0:41:50] <shieldanvil> good ol' 999 wooden arrows
[0:41:51] <Dopamien> enough arrows ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ not sure
[0:41:51] <%cobalt_phoenix_> reggie just go to the right a little
[0:41:52] <QueequegTheater> I hope he runs out of arrows
[0:41:53] <%Lion_kun> Andre sells arrows
[0:41:53] <+VictorVonLouche> Super not getting this drop
[0:41:54] <algi80> oh, right, killed the merchant, lol
[0:41:57] <%Josef_Stryker> Does Andre not sell arrows?
[0:41:59] <%Grimlockfly> he can just buy arrows from Andrew
[0:42:00] <%Solidnick18> this the experience
[0:42:00] <elshadow7> You can get it later at literally any point anyways, it's fine.
[0:42:02] <Treasure_Vault> If he runs out, he can run upstairs and try and cut it off after
[0:42:02] <VincentGraves> you don't kill merchants in these games
[0:42:04] <newbthenovicegamer> u can easily double hit it
[0:42:04] <HkxantII> He can buy off Andre
[0:42:05] <%baronblank> how many arrows do they have, I saw 41 in the menu which is definitely not enough
[0:42:05] <TigerClaws12> andre has arrows right?
[0:42:05] <+Caboose2492> this ain't happening
[0:42:08] <%TheBesteban> "Don't move" Reggie moves immediately
[0:42:09] <%Solidnick18> it's fine
[0:42:10] <%ChoculaUltra> perfect time to grab some water
[0:42:10] <%notsoy> lmao nice aim bro
[0:42:13] <%DashXero> Is he hitting the tail or the wing?
[0:42:15] <+Shishi1205> he will run out of arrows but he has Andre
[0:42:17] <lotharrio> Oh wait, he killed a merchant?
[0:42:19] <defaultname3887> o man they really doin this?
[0:42:22] <Johannen> Does he even hitting the tail part?
[0:42:22] <AvroEltz> if you run out, fuck it, suicide mission onto the bridge
[0:42:23] <%dashrendar7> 41 reg 22 Heavy
[0:42:24] <T_Sasquatch> Ive no idea if he's hitting
[0:42:25] <VincentGraves> the bow makes this game very easy, especially poison arrows
[0:42:31] <Deasmeister> 32 arrows ain't enough imo
[0:42:31] <QueequegTheater> DRAKE SWORD BAD
[0:42:33] <+ItsSansom> So.... how about that weather
[0:42:34] <nailwind> majinoTears
[0:42:35] <elshadow7> Hey, it's all part of the experience.
[0:42:36] <@Solidus_113> be funny for us streamer man
[0:42:38] <%Jakeofalco> @WoolieVersus how are you doing ?
[0:42:39] <+Suneater_Jerome> we're here for the journey
[0:42:46] <AvroEltz> GIVE CONTENT
[0:42:48] <jett_eyes> This better stay in the anime
[0:42:54] <%Sarevic> THIS IS CONTENT
[0:42:55] <buerdo> Reggie is hitting the wing tip
[0:42:59] <elshadow7> You could also put some resin on that claymore and try and chop it off
[0:43:00] <%Solidnick18> it's content
[0:43:01] <Johannen> Hell no its not, you can just ran up and whack his tail
[0:43:01] <+TheFrancix> CONTENT
[0:43:04] <MyNameIsRasus> Yo what about that Elden Ring tho
[0:43:05] <QueequegTheater> I can't wait for the Drake Sword to be abandoned after half an area when they get the claymore to _5
[0:43:06] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:43:11] <scrambledxeggz> if we didnt like this kind of goofy stuff we wouldn't be here lol
[0:43:13] <%livlinn> harass dragon grymTerry
[0:43:22] <+askalta> oh no Reggie is hitting the wing
[0:43:23] <toulon_somberjade> Drake sword is good till you can get a  +10 normal or elemental weapon
[0:43:26] <+Shishi1205> every dragon has a cuttable tail
[0:43:33] <elshadow7> And gargs
[0:43:33] <Equirah> how many arrows did he start with?
[0:43:34] <%Cozy90> woolieKICKDAD
[0:43:38] <nailwind> the patience training arc
[0:43:38] <+Shishi1205> not drakes
[0:43:40] <jett_eyes> until DS2
[0:43:42] <%Indigo_Automaton> I hope that applies to the roaming dragon boss in Elden Ring
[0:43:43] <pennykettle_> Okay I can understand that the dragon's tails are weapons even if the model doesnt look like a weapon, but how does the player even pick it up dangling over the cliff
[0:43:43] <+eanscrale> The real Dark Souls starts here!
[0:43:45] <+kewlmyc> @Equirah 40 LUL
[0:43:46] <elshadow7> And half-breeds
[0:43:46] <+ItsSansom> @Equirah Not enough. Like 40
[0:43:47] <jett_eyes> i think
[0:43:48] <@Solidus_113> valley of the drakes doesn't iirc
[0:43:48] <pepinillomaton> he is not going to get it
[0:43:49] <Equirah> anything wit a tail can be cut
[0:43:50] <QueequegTheater> @toulon_somberjade Both the uchi and claymore have higher damage at +5
[0:43:52] <TigerClaws12> is he hitting the wing?
[0:43:54] <+TheFrancix> 10 down 20 to go
[0:43:57] <Darren716> Some of the tails are bastards though
[0:44:00] <AthenaAegis> The really fun part is if you try and grind for the Drake Sword upgrade materials Kappa
[0:44:03] <toulon_somberjade> Not just dragons, almost any enemy with a tail has a tail item
[0:44:03] <buerdo> I think hes hitting wing
[0:44:04] <+Shishi1205> the blue drakes have no tail cut
[0:44:07] <%notsoy> are we sure he's hitting the tail?
[0:44:07] <Equirah> @kewlmyc @ItsSansom oh no LUL
[0:44:10] <Johannen> Yeah i dont think he is hitting the tail
[0:44:15] <penitentpendant> It would be... appropriate if he didn't buy enough
[0:44:15] <+kewlmyc> Yeah, he might be hitting the wing
[0:44:18] <Darren716> I only just got Moonlight for the first time in my recent int playthrough
[0:44:19] <pennykettle_> I don't know if I ever got the moonlight greatsword because seathes a bitch
[0:44:21] <VincentGraves> heavy arrows lose damage the farther you are so you might be doing less damage than normal arrows

[0:44:22] <TigerClaws12> Andre boutta be rich
[0:44:22] <+RemedyofRevenge> he definitely is hitting something
[0:44:23] <AbnormalVoid> Tail starts way up
[0:44:23] <+kewlmyc> On some arrows
[0:44:26] <drunken_lemur> I'd certainly hope so
[0:44:28] <taeko_ohnuki> butt
[0:44:28] <Treasure_Vault> He can still try and melee it after he runs out
[0:44:32] <elshadow7> That was tail
[0:44:35] <jett_eyes> @notsoy yeah, otherwise the drake wouldn't move
[0:44:37] <MyNameIsRasus> that's tail dude
[0:44:40] <+TheFrancix> it's tail
[0:44:41] <algi80> looks like the tail
[0:44:42] <%glaciomaniak> ya gotta aim for the bottom of the tail to be sure
[0:44:45] <pepinillomaton> It would be content if he turns out to be short, as punishment for killing the merchant
[0:44:53] <TigerClaws12> he has andre
[0:44:58] <+Cityscape17> gotta love that massive hitbox
[0:44:59] <pennykettle_> POV: you are a mosquito that wont fuck off
[0:45:06] <+RemedyofRevenge> I guess it might be hitting the wing tip
[0:45:07] <+RyTYoung> Dats the tail
[0:45:08] <%TheBesteban> That's the left pinky bro
[0:45:09] <Equirah> different spots of the tail also have different defence values
[0:45:11] <%Sarevic> Andre should offer some more
[0:45:12] <Zeif00> 🤔
[0:45:12] <QueequegTheater> It is the tail but the drake sword still sucks ass
[0:45:12] <xjn_> lobosBox
[0:45:13] <%DashXero> I hope that's the tail.
[0:45:13] <+kewlmyc> The one that don't have blood spurt out has me worried, that's all. Some clearly hit the tail.
[0:45:13] <taeko_ohnuki> @pennykettle_ lmfao
[0:45:16] <leith_aziz> pickyLurk
[0:45:18] <royb2> thats actually its face
[0:45:19] <algi80> it's long and pointy, should be a tail 4Head
[0:45:19] <tigerfang86> Im fairly certain that's the tail
[0:45:20] <rasamune> Was that a dick joke
[0:45:22] <+tomdwarf> Oh man, we doing this
[0:45:22] <+ReallyBigRocks> I'm hoping for the botch of the century
[0:45:23] <AvroEltz> i mean, you always have to second guess the jank hitboxes
[0:45:23] <nailwind> Sisyphus punishment of eternally shooting drake tails
[0:45:24] <+TheFrancix> that's his liver bro
[0:45:25] <shieldanvil> maybe that's the head, and the tail is the part that breathes fire
[0:45:25] <+Shishi1205> the hitbox is kinda wonky
[0:45:28] <anachronologist> Dragon Tails. Nice
[0:45:31] <scrambledxeggz> hit box for the break might be lower
[0:45:33] <leith_aziz> Are we somehow cheesing through this?
[0:45:36] <+patriotrenegade> the hypest gameplay on youtube
[0:45:38] <Deasmeister> Depends how funky the wings hitboxes are
[0:45:38] <lotharrio> Doing tail health damage.
[0:45:42] <@Menitta> aw yeah back at here
[0:45:43] <jett_eyes> q u a l i t y  c o n t e n t
[0:45:46] <%CateHecate> The Desolation of Smaug
[0:45:47] <Equirah> inb4 it's hitting the wing hitbox LUL
[0:45:47] <Heldr1ck> it might be hitting the wing
[0:45:49] <nailwind> this is a rite of passage
[0:45:50] <%Solidnick18> ouch! mah tail!
[0:45:51] <pennykettle_> @WoolieVersus you might be hitting the dragon body, which wont cut the tail
[0:45:51] <+askalta> there are some hits I can clearly see the blood splatter on the tail and some not. makes me concerned
[0:45:53] <vavilonica> videos games
[0:45:54] <available_line> This is conntent
[0:45:54] <+Shishi1205> Seaths tail cut is so fucking dumb
[0:45:55] <%ChoculaUltra> it must suck to be a dragon - having random dudes just going for your tail all the time
[0:45:58] <+ItsSansom> !SANITY AT RISK!
[0:45:58] <VincentGraves> woolie he's hitting 1mm away from  where the tail starts
[0:45:58] <QueequegTheater> ResidentSleeper
[0:45:58] <leith_aziz> pickyBang pickyBang pickyBang pickyBang pickyBang
[0:46:10] <+robertoszek> let's go buy more arrows, oh wait... LUL
[0:46:16] <+Suneater_Jerome> @Shishi1205 fuck that stupid ass dragon ToT
[0:46:17] <elshadow7> Why? Just use them all
[0:46:19] <Johannen> That wing in front of the tail might be getting all the arrows
[0:46:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> I think you're missing the tail sometimes, might not be enough
[0:46:23] <+RyTYoung> "Please sir, can I have some more dragon tail shooting?" Kappa
[0:46:27] <Carlioo> do you ever fight a dragon legitimately in this franchise
[0:46:29] <Texeu> Can't he buy arrows from Andre?
[0:46:29] <pepinillomaton> Hitboxes are amazing in this game
[0:46:30] <daemonazaezal> Better leave this in the Anime Episode
[0:46:31] <pennykettle_> sweat dripping down my brow
[0:46:31] <crassletter> you should have gotten it by now
[0:46:35] <QueequegTheater> @Carlioo Sinh
[0:46:36] <+ItsSansom> @Carlioo Sinh
[0:46:42] <Treasure_Vault> @Carlioo You can fight this one legitimate if you want.
[0:46:42] <MyNameIsRasus> @Carlioo does Midir count?
[0:46:44] <daemonazaezal> Next time on WoolieBallZ
[0:46:44] <%Indigo_Automaton> @Carlioo Darkeater Midir
[0:46:48] <QueequegTheater> And even sinh is already gimped
[0:46:49] <NumbF4ke> @Carlioo sinh, gaping dragon and seath
[0:46:50] <anachronologist> Evil Dies Tonight
[0:46:50] <Equirah> i just want for reggie to sit at the bonfire out of habit LUL
[0:46:51] <xjn_> at least in this game if you cheeze it, they make you work for it
[0:46:52] <nailwind> @ChoculaUltra hope Priscilla doesn't mind
[0:46:52] <agustorm123> You almost there only 500 more arrows LUL
[0:46:53] <sirrice77> I wonder if dragons talk about their tail weapons with other dragons. "yeah bro my tail drops a sick axe i hate it, they wont leave me alone bro"
[0:46:54] <thedreampie> Oh shit chat, who said we might need the merchant I wonder?
[0:46:56] <scrambledxeggz> @carlioo yea in dlc
[0:46:57] <available_line> Gough would be proud.
[0:46:57] <+kevlarkoala> yeah i'm going to be bummed if he's aiming too high, but i'll also laugh my ass off
[0:46:59] <%CateHecate> its debatable if Kalameet is a legit fight or not
[0:47:01] <+Shishi1205> kalameth is right there too
[0:47:05] <Dopamien> @Carlioo Kalameet
[0:47:08] <pepinillomaton> Not happening lol
[0:47:11] <Karebuncle> yeah i usually just do the fat part around the spike, thats garunteed
[0:47:11] <oda_flobunaga> M'dir as well
[0:47:14] <Carlioo> this is what I get for not knowing anything about dark souls, but now I know, thanks!
[0:47:17] <crassletter> yeag u should have gotten it by now
[0:47:19] <elshadow7> Oh he's got enough
[0:47:19] <QueequegTheater> Ah shit
[0:47:22] <AbnormalVoid> it's fine
[0:47:27] <leith_aziz> pickyCozy pickyCozy pickyCozy pickyCozy
[0:47:27] <elshadow7> That was good
[0:47:28] <pennykettle_> I usually try to aim for the fat part of the tip
[0:47:29] <MyNameIsRasus> to be fair kalameet is gimped af from gough's shot
[0:47:30] <+Bailey__Gaming> hit in the tip
[0:47:33] <+kewlmyc> Yes
[0:47:39] <xjn_> lobosReset
[0:47:41] <thedreampie> He’s too close. Gonna agro every time
[0:47:41] <+Bailey__Gaming> just the tip reggie!
[0:47:43] <%livlinn> the bulky part?
[0:47:47] <Iza_kku> i'm not sure, but i want to say being closer will deal more damage with the arrow
[0:47:47] <anachronologist> Just the tip
[0:47:48] <%Grimlockfly> the tip
[0:47:51] <elshadow7> Not the thinnest part!
[0:47:51] <Th3rd3> aim for the tip TehePelo
[0:47:52] <oda_flobunaga> Sinh's got a giant pole through its chest too
[0:47:55] <+ItsSansom> Perfect
[0:47:57] <pennykettle_> that oughta do it
[0:48:00] <AbnormalVoid> the tail starts way up, you can cut it off on the bridge
[0:48:00] <churropoppa> perfect
[0:48:04] <+trackles_64> who ever figured this out had the patience of  a saint
[0:48:06] <+eanscrale> You see what he means?
[0:48:09] <%Solidnick18> woops
[0:48:10] <+ReallyBigRocks> :)
[0:48:10] <penitentpendant> Premature firing there
[0:48:12] <+ItsSansom> Nice pro tip
[0:48:12] <+kewlmyc> Getting trigger happy
[0:48:12] <anachronologist> Is it worth it?
[0:48:14] <lotharrio> ONE SHY!
[0:48:16] <@Solidus_113> optimize the fun right out
[0:48:16] <%baronblank> gonna be one arrow off now lmao
[0:48:19] <elshadow7> Happens to the best of us Reggie
[0:48:22] <+trackles_64> aim for the tip
[0:48:22] <+ReallyBigRocks> :) :)
[0:48:28] <QueequegTheater> @oda_flobunaga Midir might literally be the only legit one.  Gaping and Seath are both deformed
[0:48:31] <%Grimlockfly> The tip
[0:48:32] <thedreampie> It shouldn’t be a growing like this
[0:48:40] <+kewlmyc> @anachronologist Kinda, for Reggie at least. The sword makes the beginning of the game way easier.
[0:48:44] <cheapdoc> It's working
[0:48:47] <nailwind> talk about foreplay
[0:48:48] <pennykettle_> in the OG game didnt the dragon tail go to the framerate dimension for optimization? LLU
[0:48:51] <pennykettle_> ayyy
[0:48:52] <%Solidnick18> aye
[0:48:53] <Treasure_Vault> Midir still ate a fuckton of dark and suffered for it. Dunno if he's full strength.
[0:48:53] <LunarRemix> Eyyyy

[0:49:51] <yomamma133713> @CodenameChaz a few of his hits higher up loooked like they missed.  weird to assume chat was wrong there
[0:49:55] <photoniccaster> The Noob Sword as many call it
[0:49:57] <jett_eyes> @QueequegTheater and you knock midir into a pit, same stuff
[0:50:01] <HorribleHog> but in laeWeird typo?

[0:50:19] <QueequegTheater> @jett_eyes Yes but it's only you, Midir is the only one with zero outside help
[0:50:19] <penitentpendant> But no scaling~
[0:50:19] <+Urgotfantasy> You may now play as Luigi
[0:50:20] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Yup. High base damage, but no scaling.

[0:50:33] <agustorm123> BIG SMOrc
[0:50:34] <%Lion_kun> But he has the BKS lol
[0:50:37] <QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus He can upgrade the claymore to be stronger LITERALLY RIGHT NOW
[0:50:37] <thedreampie> That scaling though
[0:50:38] <BigYanno> but the damage drops off HARD
[0:50:40] <cheapdoc> It's like the firebombs kindda
[0:50:51] <crassletter> its good early game but is trash past mid
[0:50:55] <+RemedyofRevenge> @A_German_spy Do you know why Seeth doesn't use any weapons in his boss fight? Because they are scaleless :)
[0:50:56] <jett_eyes> @QueequegTheater ah, true true
[0:50:58] <tigerfang86> for now it's a fine option
[0:50:59] <pennykettle_> @QueequegTheater its fine lol
[0:51:12] <@Solidus_113> you can use it for the depths and darkroot
[0:51:12] <+eanscrale> honestly you probably shouldn't even be using this thing after the depths
[0:51:15] <%Bread_Assassin> Reggie still got the black knight sword in his pocket. It has higher base damage and still has scaling.
[0:51:16] <seydaq> durability go way down
[0:51:16] <+kewlmyc> Saying it's a cheat is a bit much. It's not like bum rushing to the Great Scythe at the beginning of the game or something.
[0:51:18] <BigYanno> the claymore at +5 will do more damage I think
[0:51:18] <%A_German_spy> @RemedyofRevenge karacoLOL spyWhy
[0:51:21] <+Darky04> dont get too dependent on this sword
[0:51:30] <shieldanvil> laughs in zwei
[0:51:31] <Crowroost> huh, 10 minutes, not bad
[0:51:39] <photoniccaster> OP Beginner Weapon Unlocked
[0:51:39] <Scorchfield> after about the second bell is where it really starts to fall off, if you are still using it in sens its bad
[0:51:41] <+Shishi1205> btw fun fact I did not know till 3 days ago seath can break his own crystal lmao
[0:51:47] <+lostsaint25> lostsaint25 subscribed with Prime. 
[0:51:49] <%Solidnick18> yes
[0:51:52] <BigYanno> every weapon has a different moveset
[0:51:56] <lotharrio> Just about everything has its own moveset.
[0:51:56] <crassletter> @shieldanvil My man
[0:51:59] <%Solidnick18> Testing never hurt nothing
[0:52:05] <+ItsSansom> @Shishi1205 Must be awkward for him
[0:52:09] <+eanscrale> All the rapier class weapons are super different
[0:52:10] <%CateHecate> the other downside of the drake sword is that your viewers will call you a huge coward who is backing down Kappa
[0:52:15] <@Solidus_113> the 2H R2 kills durability
[0:52:22] <%glaciomaniak> I don't suppose you can cross invade in this game huh
[0:52:26] <+patriotrenegade> Show him the two hand R2 he'll never want to get rid of it LUL
[0:52:27] <QueequegTheater> Amazing Kappa
[0:52:33] <AvroEltz> Defense boost
[0:52:34] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus The Drake Sword gives you some elemental defense.
[0:52:34] <anachronologist> EASY MODE
[0:52:36] <Crowroost> a TEMPORARILY amazing sword
[0:52:38] <elshadow7> Nope
[0:52:38] <LunarRemix> No that's a Dragon Weapon effect. Dragon Weapons boost Magic defense
[0:52:39] <sendart> sword boost defence
[0:52:41] <Hellvis92> drake sword raises fire resistance
[0:52:42] <%jepupu> Fire defense
[0:52:43] <vivaciouseff> dragon weapons provide buffs sometimes
[0:52:46] <toulon_somberjade> The R2 was useful for taking down the first titanite demon for me
[0:52:47] <+Kyma1020> defense boost from Drake Sword
[0:52:47] <crassletter> fire defense
[0:52:48] <QueequegTheater> Magic defense up
[0:52:49] <%haitakaa> sword has a buff
[0:52:49] <lotharrio> It's any buff you have
[0:52:53] <BigYanno> I never knew dragon weapons boosted defense
[0:52:55] <pennykettle_> Thats just the symbol for any buff. The grass crest shield will show that too IIRC
[0:53:10] <+RemedyofRevenge> hit em with the two handed r2
[0:53:12] <seydaq> after years of playing i still have no idea what any symbols mean
[0:53:12] <elshadow7> Fire and Magic defense +15 apparently
[0:53:16] <QueequegTheater> @pennykettle_ Stamina regen is a different color shield
[0:53:19] <pennykettle_> Is the drake sword the one with the special cast?
[0:53:22] <+eanscrale> Honestly, I never used this thing cause it's so damn ugly
[0:53:24] <anachronologist> What's his build tho?
[0:53:32] <%CateHecate> Tight spot ahead
[0:53:37] <+Shishi1205> 2h R2 with drake weapons in ds1 are the original weapon arts
[0:53:37] <%glaciomaniak> @pennykettle_ love keeping grass crest on my back
[0:53:37] <Crowroost> Shield Icon go up, legitimately gettin gud go down
[0:53:42] <Dopamien> @anachronologist probably quality

[0:53:54] <pennykettle_> @glaciomaniak it keeps you warm and cozy like a turtle
[0:53:54] <@Solidus_113> THAT KILLS DURABILITY
[0:53:57] <elshadow7> !WEAPON AT RISK!
[0:53:58] <QueequegTheater> @anachronologist quality build because they have not committed to anything
[0:54:05] <TenorSounds> Durability go down
[0:54:10] <newbthenovicegamer> is stream choppy or my pc bad?
[0:54:10] <@Solidus_113> 30 cost
[0:54:10] <BigYanno> that did 30 durability
[0:54:11] <algi80> -30
[0:54:16] <pennykettle_> specials are the durabilitykiller
[0:54:18] <+Grayhammatter> kills durability
[0:54:29] <QueequegTheater> NEVER USE IT
[0:54:29] <lotharrio> Use it ten times and then stop.
[0:54:31] <QueequegTheater> NEVER
[0:54:32] <pennykettle_> or carry hella powder
[0:54:33] <AbnormalVoid> making the cost durability was such a weird idea lol
[0:54:34] <elshadow7> You can't have cool things in Dark Souls!
[0:54:36] <+FordTheOcean> cool shit ain't free
[0:54:36] <AvroEltz> Reggie, its a ranged r2, ITS REALLY GOOD
[0:54:46] <+Shishi1205> yah this is why weapon arts in ds3 are way better mechanic
[0:54:46] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Repair Powder = more ammo for those special attacks.
[0:54:49] <seydaq> the int one is amazing
[0:54:59] <+eanscrale> most of the unique attacks in this game are pretty meh in use unfortunately.
[0:55:01] <PlagueOfGripes> how the hell did reggie get the drake... he shot it with arrows, didn't he
[0:55:06] <@Solidus_113> yes
[0:55:08] <HkxantII> Yup
[0:55:08] <+askalta> it's almost like a shitty moonlight greatsword
[0:55:08] <NumbF4ke> Ye
[0:55:11] <elshadow7> Of course he did
[0:55:13] <%glaciomaniak> of course
[0:55:13] <pennykettle_> I thought weapon arts were disappointing overall in their usefulness. It's hard to be the good old R1
[0:55:13] <seydaq> yup
[0:55:14] <ThePayphone> @PlagueOfGripes he seduced it
[0:55:18] <%Prowtellen> yeah
[0:55:18] <anachronologist> He should have a weapon in mind for the full playthrough. I suggest an Axe
[0:55:19] <+patriotrenegade> @PlagueOfGripes is there another way? Kappa
[0:55:20] <toulon_somberjade> Yep like everyone
[0:55:32] <%ChoculaUltra> it's the "we got a moonlight greatsword projectile at home" kind of vibe
[0:55:34] <okramv> What a lad
[0:55:37] <okramv> Not using Drake
[0:55:38] <seydaq> gave the dragon a snoof
[0:55:42] <QueequegTheater> @PlagueOfGripes Pretty sure the claymore he is already carrying can be upgraded to have better damage too.
[0:55:43] <+eanscrale> @PlagueOfGripes He asked very nicely.
[0:55:44] <Treasure_Vault> You can fight it on the bridge and take his tail if you're a dumbass
[0:55:44] <elshadow7> @ChoculaUltra LUL
[0:55:45] <pennykettle_> I've never seen anyone cut the drake tail with melee
[0:55:45] <TenorSounds> It’s cool you can buy repair powder from- oh wait nevermind
[0:55:46] <+Shishi1205> weapon arts are rad tho at least strength scaling weapon arts
[0:55:47] <okramv> Better than me
[0:55:47] <%Indigo_Automaton> Saved
[0:55:53] <+askalta> call a vote
[0:55:59] <+patriotrenegade> the giant
[0:55:59] <+Grayhammatter> andre the giant
[0:56:12] <chancho4tierra> Black knight sword shall be remembered
[0:56:14] <PlagueOfGripes> surprised he hasn't tried Zwei if he's this far with the claymore, as amazing as claymore is
[0:56:18] <+askalta> claymore vs uchi vs drake sword
[0:56:18] <Demoli_PT> how far in is reggie?
[0:56:22] <Demoli_PT> gargoyles?
[0:56:26] <+ItsSansom> @Demoli_PT Beaten Gargoyles
[0:56:27] <pennykettle_> he just beat gargoyles last time
[0:56:28] <toulon_somberjade> Okay but at this point in the game can he upgrade weapons efficiency
[0:56:36] <%Solidnick18> the uchi
[0:56:36] <daemonazaezal> hasnt touched the depths yet
[0:56:38] <%glaciomaniak> he tried zwei for like a second but didn't have the stats
[0:56:41] <PlagueOfGripes> aw man, they killed the merchant?
[0:56:41] <%CateHecate> weirdly enough, as far as the souls games go, DS1 has probably the roster of weapons that are the most down-to-earth and realistic, just in terms of style and size
[0:56:43] <+Shishi1205> he has souls for a +5
[0:56:44] <@Solidus_113> LP Funsies
[0:56:50] <elshadow7> Too dead
[0:56:52] <QueequegTheater> @PlagueOfGripes No he's just sleeping
[0:57:03] <thedreampie> One handing greatswords?
[0:57:06] <+askalta> he offended Reggie
[0:57:06] <%DashXero> @PlagueOfGripes Yeah. I'm kinda disappointed too.
[0:57:10] <toulon_somberjade> I get this feeling I'm the only one who didn't kill the merchant

[0:57:22] <pennykettle_> killing the merchant is blasphemy. And now they cant arrow cheese the undead dragon Kappa
[0:57:23] <PlagueOfGripes> the merchant is super useful early. I never bother killing him for that dumb stick
[0:57:29] <+RyTYoung> Who's running around with a pocket full of change??
[0:57:30] <QueequegTheater> That overhead is one of the hardest attacks to parry, swear to god
[0:57:33] <toulon_somberjade> Mostly because I use Kirk's sword
[0:57:37] <%Grimlockfly> @PlagueOfGripes love that stick tho

[1:02:27] <defaultname3887> you can turn that off
[1:02:31] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus You can turn off auto-targeting in the Options menu. I always disable it, for exactly this reason.
[1:02:33] <Wakka47> you wont hit the wall if you forward + r2

[1:02:55] <+ItsSansom> @Artumoc About 45 mins ago
[1:02:57] <KyberNasse> Dark Souls is good at slamming you back to earth when youre being too cocky LUL
[1:03:01] <AvroEltz> also, knowing your 2 handed moveset and quickly changing it in a fight is good practice, sometimes 2 handed will take less hits to kill
[1:03:07] <pennykettle_> when does the haircut squad spawn
[1:03:15] <oda_flobunaga> I hope they have a new asset for the chests in Elden ring
[1:03:16] <%CateHecate> @pennykettle_ after capra
[1:03:17] <@Solidus_113> after the 2nd bell iirc
[1:03:19] <+TheFrancix> please sit down
[1:03:19] <WerdIce> @pennykettle_ After Capra
[1:03:21] <Bonebagmel> DId golden boy did the thing to reggie?
[1:03:25] <@Solidus_113> or yeah just capra

[1:03:36] <ds3namecaldara> gameplay showcase seems like they did
[1:03:39] <+ReallyBigRocks> god look at those pecs
[1:03:41] <shotguncrucifix> hey marksman timthetatman is playing vanguard on pc why aren't you
[1:03:41] <AvroEltz> 2nd isnt when they leave?
[1:03:43] <Equirah> @oda_flobunaga they already showed they don't even the mimmick chain gimmick is the same
[1:03:45] <shotguncrucifix> oops wrong chat
[1:03:46] <pennykettle_> I remember I accidentally killed Petrus early in my first playthrough so the squad aggroed on me
[1:03:52] <+ReallyBigRocks> Reggarth the Cut
[1:03:52] <+ItsSansom> Oh man I can't wait for lower burg
[1:03:56] <p3niletrauma> Oh shit is this that new Elder Scrolls mod?
[1:03:58] <%CateHecate> only know that because I JUST beat capra and had to buy miracles from haircut lol
[1:04:13] <%glaciomaniak> @a_german_spy @plagueofgripes how you guys feeling about the new elden ring trailer
[1:04:13] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:04:35] <+swesterly> No they can’t go in there Kappa
[1:04:37] <%PlagueOfGripes> did a twitter thread about it. looks very fromsoft. mostly glad it didn't seem too fast or spammy
[1:04:47] <toulon_somberjade> Souls of the Wild
[1:04:48] <%A_German_spy> @glaciomaniak It's about what I expected. Game looks like it's running on DS3's engine, so you can expect lots of reused assets and systems.
[1:05:01] <@Solidus_113> what about the boss that was doing big spins and flips
[1:05:04] <pennykettle_> I had to unfollow Vaati today because I'm trying not to look at or read anything about Elden Ring
[1:05:12] <+patriotrenegade> @PlagueOfGripes Excited for another Dancer of the Boreal Valley?
[1:05:14] <anachronologist> Seriously, reverse hallowing. It gets you more drops

[1:05:28] <@Moobot> @DueSquash WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 13 minutes
[1:05:32] <%glaciomaniak> I'm excited about the stealth
[1:05:37] <+ReallyBigRocks> Trigger discipline
[1:05:37] <elshadow7> Trigger safety
[1:05:39] <@Menitta> Elden looks neat
[1:05:42] <Style_train_14> Pot Man!
[1:05:44] <+ItsSansom> Has he seen the boi through the door here?
[1:05:45] <oda_flobunaga> @Equirah I know, I hope that's a placeholder and will be changed.  but with all the reused animations too it looks like DS IV, open world edition.. Ultimately not a bad thing but...
[1:05:47] <%Quasimofo> @anachronologist and gets him invaded
[1:05:49] <pennykettle_> anor londo?? is that anor londo????
[1:05:50] <AbnormalVoid> @Menitta ye
[1:05:56] <AvroEltz> Sens fortress? sounds like a fun house to me
[1:06:00] <+patriotrenegade> Anal Rodeo....
[1:06:02] <@Menitta> hopefully it's more unique than it looks honestly
[1:06:02] <toulon_somberjade> Elden feels like what they wanted to do with DS2
[1:06:05] <Xaeveax> @ItsSansom Don't think so
[1:06:09] <%mr_sups> The House of Fun
[1:06:11] <AbnormalVoid> for sure
[1:06:19] <bippityjones> Reg-"If I don't swing I don't win"-gie
[1:06:23] <Darren716> Damn I forgot him being called an onion was canon
[1:06:25] <shieldanvil> sen's is fun
[1:06:31] <shieldanvil> i love visiting him
[1:06:35] <AbnormalVoid> Cata cooms
[1:06:35] <elshadow7> "Divine Blacksmith" sounds way cooler than what it actually is
[1:06:38] <pennykettle_> @Darren716 I think even the armor descrip mentions it
[1:06:45] <@Menitta> I dont really like the idea of "dark souls but open world" on paper but I have faith theyll make it more interesting than a regular open world
[1:06:53] <vivaciouseff> @Darren716 it's 100% canon, it's the best
[1:06:56] <+Shishi1205> huh? is he refering to post butterfly blacksmith?
[1:07:03] <elshadow7> Ye
[1:07:09] <%CateHecate> so not worth it lmao
[1:07:10] <+askalta> look at the scaling chages
[1:07:10] <pennykettle_> @Shishi1205 I think he was saying the skeleton one
[1:07:14] <anachronologist> TIME TO PICK A DISCIPLINE
[1:07:22] <%A_German_spy> @shieldanvil Yeah, the one that has the divine ember
[1:07:23] <KyberNasse> the xbox mic blacksmith
[1:07:24] <%haitakaa> bastard sword is nice
[1:07:26] <+NopeBadguy> definitely grab the boxes first
[1:07:27] <Treasure_Vault> Check your storage for weapons too?
[1:07:30] <+Shishi1205> skeleton dude is nowhere near darkroot
[1:07:34] <daemonazaezal> He is referencing the post mnbf petrified blacksmith
[1:07:38] <anachronologist> GO AXE. Heavey AXE
[1:07:39] <%haitakaa> no
[1:07:42] <+ItsSansom> Andre smithing at a reasonable speed
[1:07:44] <oda_flobunaga> No
[1:07:46] <@Solidus_113> it's the same
[1:07:48] <+BignanasTheGawd> finally more dank souls
[1:07:50] <pennykettle_> I thought he said the catacombs, I was half-listening
[1:07:52] <+askalta> it's free it just takes material
[1:07:56] <%CateHecate> [Berserk Clang]
[1:08:02] <anachronologist> BATTLE AXE
[1:08:02] <Treasure_Vault> Did Reggie ever try out his Zwei?
[1:08:05] <+patriotrenegade> The petrified blacksmith that looks exactly like Andre and has the haunted anvil
[1:08:05] <Darren716> Has literally anyone ever used the war pick?
[1:08:12] <+askalta> I must have brain damage.
[1:08:14] <+Shishi1205> he did swing it but hit no one
[1:08:14] <daemonazaezal> He said those having issues in the catacombs seek the blacksmith in darkroot garden
[1:08:15] <@Solidus_113> 1-5 you can do yourself, then you gotta come back to Andre to make it +6
[1:08:20] <Treasure_Vault> @Darren716 Yeah it's neat, in DS3
[1:08:20] <anachronologist> +5 Battle Axe
[1:08:22] <+patriotrenegade> @Darren716 for like three minutes
[1:08:28] <pennykettle_> @daemonazaezal ohhh okay
[1:08:49] <daemonazaezal> cause divine vs skeletons
[1:08:50] <Treasure_Vault> What size swords?
[1:08:52] <Xaeveax> Does he like turtles?
[1:08:54] <%haitakaa> bastard
[1:08:55] <daemonazaezal> but yeah :)
[1:08:55] <+pupil31> Fire Emblem Shoto Character PogChamp
[1:08:57] <+BignanasTheGawd> firebomb run?
[1:08:58] <gryffinp> there were some meme videos with the war pick in ds1
[1:08:58] <Dopamien> D:
[1:08:58] <%CateHecate> i know we've seen a lot of big weapon playthroughs but i really hope reggie goes for zwei or claymore so we can get CLANG swordsman reggarth
[1:08:59] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[1:09:00] <%Solidnick18> okay
[1:09:00] <haisho> when's swordchucks
[1:09:02] <teh_Question> no poke
[1:09:03] <Treasure_Vault> Try Zwei?
[1:09:06] <@Solidus_113> Reggie hasn't tried out the Zweihander yet either
[1:09:06] <AvroEltz> Woolie, STOP
[1:09:08] <%Artoo__The_Me> LUL
[1:09:08] <teh_Question> woolie is shook
[1:09:09] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @anachronologist
[1:09:10] <+Jiggisnipe> Reggie hates Woolie's weapons
[1:09:13] <%cobalt_phoenix_> Kappa
[1:09:14] <+ItsSansom> "Not a fan of spears" *Woolie flashbacks to toothpick*
[1:09:14] <%hiswill98> Zweihander
[1:09:14] <+Robnoceros> Zwei is life
[1:09:16] <linSP> Chaos Zwei
[1:09:18] <@Solidus_113> Reggie is based for hating spears
[1:09:22] <Treasure_Vault> Zwei in storage is RAD
[1:09:22] <%Solidnick18> i love that one long weapon
[1:09:25] <+mechslayer71> Reggie turns his back on boredom and woolie tries to pull him back in
[1:09:25] <+TheFrancix> TOOTHPICK BOIS
[1:09:25] <Darren716> Woolie loves being a coward
[1:09:26] <%Indigo_Automaton> Spears are humanity's oldest and most reliable weapon
[1:09:27] <anachronologist> sry
[1:09:27] <+patriotrenegade> Zweihandere
[1:09:28] <MrMatternot> I don't want a long spear, 5 min after learning that hallway fighting is super important....
[1:09:31] <linSP> Knife boy
[1:09:31] <+kevlarkoala> the contrarian!
[1:09:32] <buerdo> Wood club op
[1:09:32] <gryffinp> the truly rare build is the GIGANTIC AXE build
[1:09:34] <+Xeogred> spears are so boring haha
[1:09:36] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Reject weapons USE FISTS
[1:09:37] <%Solidnick18> that has curved blade at the end
[1:09:40] <elshadow7> Oh no, why are we talking about spears?
[1:09:42] <%Prevot> woolie is a weapon hipster
[1:09:44] <DSD24> Spears are rad as fuck
[1:09:46] <ds3namecaldara> I'd be interested in seeing Reggie go strength but we'll see what he decides
[1:09:47] <+robertoszek> a stick with a pointy end
[1:09:47] <Arqartur0> Ok,I just saw the Elden Ring Gameplay trailer... HOLY SHIT! Everything's Alive and purty!
[1:09:50] <+Shishi1205> I like big swords, yes I man GS in MH how did you know
[1:09:54] <srv4254> spears in nioh tho
[1:09:54] <djblue_shift> don't listen to this man, he'd sell out humanity for a jetpack
[1:09:55] <%PlagueOfGripes> swords were backup weapons. even nobles used spears most of the time
[1:09:55] <Equirah> you're playing the romanticized notion
[1:09:56] <someyounguy1> Halberds that are axes and spears were also very utilitarian
[1:09:56] <%Indigo_Automaton> Swordspears are the best
[1:09:56] <MrMatternot> Sword is a sidearm. Not the main weapon
[1:09:56] <shotguncrucifix> swords are soymode and cringe. Spears are based
[1:10:00] <QueequegTheater> Oh my god Woolie IS a weapon hipster
[1:10:00] <%glaciomaniak> I want a dual glaive, it's the only thing I've ever wanted
[1:10:03] <%dreadedcthulhu> GUNGNIR
[1:10:04] <+eanscrale> well Cu Culain does
[1:10:04] <+BignanasTheGawd> but who wants to be a average dude
[1:10:07] <agustorm123> I like spears too
[1:10:07] <+NopeBadguy> Cu Chullain
[1:10:07] <DuckfishPrime> @gryffinp Gigantic axe is great
[1:10:07] <vavilonica> When's a Pike and Shot build
[1:10:10] <linSP> What about axes
[1:10:10] <+Shishi1205> Durandal?
[1:10:10] <sendart> rhongo bongo
[1:10:12] <+Jiggisnipe> Give me a sick polearm
[1:10:12] <DSD24> Cu Chullain does
[1:10:12] <teh_Question> DS1 was built to slug a fucking greatsword around
[1:10:13] <lotharrio> Odin
[1:10:13] <Darren716> The literal spear of destiny?
[1:10:13] <+parazoa42> Odin
[1:10:14] <nailwind> farmer tools as weapons are rad
[1:10:15] <%Tearonex> pointy rock on stick
[1:10:16] <shieldanvil> REJECT WEAPONS RETURN TO MAGIC
[1:10:17] <+pectusumbra> actually a lot of myth heroes used spears
[1:10:17] <seydaq> all the lancers in fate
[1:10:18] <ds3namecaldara> Yeah my week will hopefully be consumed by the network test
[1:10:19] <pennykettle_> I pulled this Caestus out of the stone
[1:10:19] <oda_flobunaga> GUNGNIR
[1:10:19] <alroy909> the magical halberd of the lake
[1:10:22] <elshadow7> Reggie, don't listen to his lies!
[1:10:22] <anachronologist> Halberd is also nice in my opionion
[1:10:23] <rasamune> Cu Chulainn is typing...
[1:10:26] <IzanagiNoOokami> Woolie just wants to be Lancer
[1:10:29] <Treasure_Vault> Good to try weapons.
[1:10:31] <DSD24> What about the Lance of Longinus
[1:10:33] <agustorm123> Daggers are cool
[1:10:34] <lotharrio> A couple Irish heroes, actually.
[1:10:36] <Treasure_Vault> But also try Zwei.
[1:10:36] <Hellvis92> gae bolg, brionac, etc.
[1:10:37] <Xaeveax> I think he should go back to the hand axe LUL
[1:10:37] <+ItsSansom> Ooooh I like this direction
[1:10:37] <Arqartur0> there are some legendary Spears outt here
[1:10:39] <toulon_somberjade> Percival
[1:10:41] <%hiswill98> Try the Zweihander!
[1:10:43] <daemonazaezal> but what about great scythe>?
[1:10:44] <oda_flobunaga> @WoolieVersus Izanagi
[1:10:44] <+Robnoceros> I wish I vibed more with the axes in Souls games, but there's just something about them I'm not crazy about
[1:10:44] <%Quasimofo> Spears are cool, but fighting with a staff or tonfas is the coolest. Maximum style
[1:10:45] <%Josef_Stryker> Dragoons tho!
[1:10:48] <+eanscrale> Yo ain't no one mess with my goi Cu Chulain
[1:10:49] <elshadow7> Wonder how Reggie will feel about Lucy?
[1:10:49] <linSP> Battle axe is cool
[1:10:50] <toulon_somberjade> Who's spear can nuke castles
[1:10:50] <oda_flobunaga> Amenonuhoko
[1:10:54] <Treasure_Vault> New weapons are almost always worth the investment.
[1:10:54] <+kevlarkoala> one day, I'll do a caestus run in this game
[1:10:54] <%Solidnick18> @daemonazaezal yesssssss
[1:11:02] <+Shishi1205> Aquiles too
[1:11:06] <+TheFrancix> artorias...
[1:11:09] <QueequegTheater> >Armor as well Kappa
[1:11:11] <%PlagueOfGripes> swords are the marketable weapon, but spears have always been THE weapon
[1:11:11] <ds3namecaldara> Lucy Lucern is amazing
[1:11:12] <+kevlarkoala> this is Remastered, right?
[1:11:12] <DSD24> @Quasimofo Best staff user I can think of is Kilik from Soul Calibur
[1:11:13] <+Aikao> oh shit the boar helm LUL
[1:11:13] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:11:17] <seydaq> shaka disapproves
[1:11:27] <khalcatto> did I miss anything
[1:11:32] <oda_flobunaga> Amenonuhoko, the spear which forged Japan from the primordial ocean
[1:11:33] <%CateHecate> god i hope that with elden ring seemingly somewhat influenced by norse/celtic mythology we get some cool ass spears. Give me Gae Bolga, fromsoft
[1:11:33] <mf_doomfist98> !uptime
[1:11:33] <@Moobot> @mf_doomfist98 WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 19 minutes
[1:11:36] <%PlagueOfGripes> he didn't notice the mimic head
[1:11:36] <+ItsSansom> @khalcatto Dragon tail shooting
[1:11:41] <%Josef_Stryker> Claymore!
[1:11:44] <someyounguy1> axes are fun
[1:11:47] <DapperCadavr> chat has Reggie checked out Darkroot yet?
[1:11:49] <%ozzrabbit> … when it comes to legendary spears, Odin and Cú Cullin spring to mind.
[1:11:51] <wibbwobbler> Battle axe run
[1:11:52] <%Solidnick18> big whiff
[1:11:52] <anachronologist> Battle Axe all day!
[1:11:53] <someyounguy1> theres less recovery on hit
[1:11:54] <toulon_somberjade> Also about half of Chinese heroes use Spears and polearms
[1:11:56] <+cdrom321> @seydaq Shaka when the walls fell.
[1:11:57] <%cobalt_phoenix_> honestly he can upgrade things to +2 or 3 for basically free, the only things lost are souls to buy the shards and the actual upgrade
[1:11:58] <alroy909> or the Bec-de-corbin of the enchanted forest
[1:11:58] <%Indigo_Automaton> Try it out on the dudes upstairs
[1:11:59] <Treasure_Vault> Zweihander in storage might be a fun romp, but I'm done being a broken record.
[1:12:00] <haisho> the big whiffs for the big damage
[1:12:04] <%Solidnick18> good over head
[1:12:05] <bobxmaker> you do come by titanite shards pretty easy though so it's not like an heavy investment
[1:12:07] <+Shishi1205> Guan Dao and Yao yeah
[1:12:09] <Darren716> Oh shit Reggie hasn't met Andres neighbor has he?
[1:12:12] <pennykettle_> I hope when they enter Darkroot they notice that you can see the butterfly at the very start
[1:12:12] <AbnormalVoid> choppy time
[1:12:13] <DSD24> Zhou Yu uses a spear!
[1:12:15] <anachronologist> It's nice to chop trees
[1:12:16] <%PlagueOfGripes> this is the weapon probably MOST players start with, since Bandit statistically the usually the best class for most non-magic build types
[1:12:19] <Heroes_of_Vale> I always found the unique Axe properties interesting
[1:12:21] <agustorm123> Slow weapons are so ResidentSleeper
[1:12:23] <UnlimitedBick> @toulon_somberjade The weapon of the common man
[1:12:26] <%CateHecate> Use a big spear, just like Lu Bu woulda done
[1:12:29] <%hiswill98> I can’t believe I’m saying this but after watching the Elden Ring gameplay I’m considering running a bow as my main weapon
[1:12:36] <shieldanvil> axes and halberds have extra recovery on whiff
[1:12:40] <%ozzrabbit> Oh, and let’s not forget Nezha
[1:12:47] <shotguncrucifix> lubu fat rolled and cheesed arrows
[1:12:51] <khalcatto> elden ring actually made magic look dope
[1:12:52] <someyounguy1> does reggie have a ring other than blue tearstone?
[1:12:53] <DSD24> Nezha is pretty cool
[1:12:54] <anachronologist> Bows are great
[1:12:59] <%PlagueOfGripes> still has the zwei in storage
[1:13:03] <+ItsSansom> @hiswill98 Haven't watched the trailer, staying pure on it, but does bow seem like a viable weapon route now?
[1:13:04] <Treasure_Vault> @khalcatto Nice effects on the soul beam.
[1:13:04] <DedlokPM> Weapon Harem
[1:13:05] <brunoberserk> titanite shard are almost free anyway , is okay spending them , dont be a pat ...
[1:13:05] <%Prowtellen> I know 0 people who picked Bandit as a starting class
[1:13:09] <elshadow7> @hiswill98 Shut up! Really? Been waiting for so long for bows to be good.
[1:13:09] <Carlioo> the katana is calling you
[1:13:12] <HkxantII> Check your storage man
[1:13:14] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Not just the ladies Kappa
[1:13:17] <AbnormalVoid> could try out the Zweihander m6kwDinking
[1:13:18] <+kevlarkoala> i think i literally always start Pyro
[1:13:18] <Xaeveax> Good choice
[1:13:20] <%CateHecate> [C L A N G]
[1:13:22] <GhoulishCripple> get BIG reggie
[1:13:23] <Darren716> Upgrades are super cheap right now, and Andre just sells the stones as well
[1:13:23] <AvroEltz> SURPRISE OPTION, UPGRADE CROSSBOW
[1:13:24] <%hiswill98> I might go for bow/magic in Elden Ring
[1:13:26] <Crowroost> still with teh menus and the andre and decision paralysis eh? bbl
[1:13:30] <%PlagueOfGripes> claymore is the best overall weapon in the series, so. can't blame that
[1:13:30] <+Robnoceros> Claymore is great until you can use the Zwei
[1:13:32] <+kevlarkoala> also, i've never bothered to care about the differences in starting classes lol
[1:13:33] <oda_flobunaga> Clayevenmore>Claymore
[1:13:34] <Darren716> Upgrading repairs your gear
[1:13:34] <%dreadedcthulhu> do not repair first, upgrading repaies
[1:13:35] <@Solidus_113> upgrade repairs weapons
[1:13:38] <%dreadedcthulhu> repairs*
[1:13:43] <seydaq> so yulia got widowed for nuthin LUL
[1:13:49] <someyounguy1> shards come by often as well
[1:13:50] <ds3namecaldara> Claymore can't be beat because quality
[1:13:50] <%ozzrabbit> OH! Forgot Izanami and Izanagi!
[1:13:50] <pixel_river> my fear is that elden ring completely overwhelms you with its openness and optuseness, but thats also the exciting part
[1:13:51] <AbnormalVoid> you'll be shitting shards by the end of teh game
[1:13:54] <DSD24> There was that Dual Spears guy in that Elden Ring gameplay thing and he had cool moves
[1:13:55] <anachronologist> Claymore is a nice choice
[1:13:56] <lotharrio> Low tier upgrade items are basically endless by the end of these games.
[1:14:02] <%Indigo_Automaton> Might as well upgrade it again
[1:14:06] <bobxmaker> you know woolies take on spear struck a chord with me, i might actually make a spear character in elden ring.
[1:14:09] <+Jiggisnipe> @seydaq he killed him cuz he hated him not for the Uchi LUL
[1:14:11] <elshadow7> Woolie, might wanna remark that upgrade materials are not that hard to come by for the early stages of upgrading
[1:14:18] <%Indigo_Automaton> Buy a shard and upgrade it again
[1:14:19] <Treasure_Vault> @ozzrabbit So extrapolating to Gwynn, Velka was his wife, right?
[1:14:32] <toulon_somberjade> Upgrading us the only way to repair Crystal weapons but are you really gonna spend chunks on that?

[1:14:49] <DSD24> There was twinspears in Dark Souls 3
[1:14:49] <seydaq> @jiggisnipe regarth has gotten cold since the des days
[1:14:50] <%glaciomaniak> I'm ready for the titanite demon to fuck Reggie up
[1:14:50] <AbnormalVoid> also, the price of shards is incredibly negligible by end game, they're like...one enemy worth of souls for two shards endgame
[1:14:51] <%CateHecate> or like one hollow
[1:14:56] <%PlagueOfGripes> you can also farm large titanite shards early but it's too much of a pain in the ass for an LP
[1:15:11] <brunoberserk> yeyeye claymore boys go up , of course reggie likes the claymore , claymore moveset is the '' ryu '' of the game if you think about it , and is okay because is a good weapon
[1:15:13] <%CateHecate> it does
[1:15:15] <%Indigo_Automaton> Yes
[1:15:15] <LunarRemix> Yes
[1:15:16] <%cobalt_phoenix_> yes
[1:15:17] <%dreadedcthulhu> yes
[1:15:19] <agustorm123> Hope we get the bloodbourne remaster soon
[1:15:19] <Xaeveax> Yes
[1:15:19] <teh_Question> yes
[1:15:20] <+askalta> you can get large titanium shards mid game its not worth farming
[1:15:27] <DSD24> Claymore also has the cool sheath
[1:15:36] <DedlokPM> @Crowroost It's almost like it is something that happens when someone plays a game like dark souls all the time. If you come here to watch this stream and not expect stuff like this then you are naive "expert." So why publicly complain about it
[1:15:37] <AbnormalVoid> @brunoberserk water without any ice
[1:15:37] <anachronologist> @PlagueOfGripes It's easy peasy right around now. Just farm Baldur Knights
[1:15:38] <+swesterly> @plagueofgripes the slime drop rate is fucking cooked
[1:15:53] <Heroes_of_Vale> around 3 k
[1:16:01] <anachronologist> @swesterly Indeed it is
[1:16:03] <photoniccaster> Just gotta get the rusted ring and farm those leeches in blighttown for those large shards, lol.
[1:16:11] <elshadow7> ON the other hand pyromancy>slimes
[1:16:12] <%ozzrabbit> Hey chat… does Zeus count as using a spear? Not sure where the lightning bolt falls in this
[1:16:12] <+Shishi1205> 2800
[1:16:19] <Darren716> For my int build recently I went to farm the slugs for green shards super early
[1:16:25] <QueequegTheater> No, Zeus uses a ranged weapon
[1:16:26] <Darren716> that's an hour I won't be getting back
[1:16:29] <+Shishi1205> bolts are projectiles
[1:16:29] <lotharrio> @ozzrabbit Throwing weapon.
[1:16:32] <toulon_somberjade> Was the price lowered in remastered?
[1:16:32] <QueequegTheater> That's a magic javelin not a spear
[1:16:33] <ds3namecaldara> just ignore those people
[1:16:39] <%CateHecate> BIG and STRONG reggarth
[1:16:40] <QueequegTheater> @toulon_somberjade no
[1:16:43] <pennykettle_> @Darren716 then just watch the youtube upload
[1:16:43] <oda_flobunaga> Posiden, trident?
[1:16:45] <elshadow7> @Darren716 Like all the other hours
[1:16:45] <%PlagueOfGripes> slimes always drop greens when you want large and large when you want green
[1:16:46] <bobxmaker> i'd say zeus bolts are more like javelins
[1:16:46] <toulon_somberjade> Thought they were 3800
[1:16:49] <%ozzrabbit> But Athena had a spear, correct?
[1:16:50] <+askalta> upgrade does reapair durability right
[1:16:50] <@Solidus_113> there's the door right next to andre to check out
[1:16:50] <MrMatternot> Darkroot Butterfly
[1:16:56] <DedlokPM> @ds3namecaldara nah. assholes should be blown the fuck up
[1:16:56] <lotharrio> Trident is close enough to a spear that it should count.
[1:16:56] <DSD24> Athena had a spear yes
[1:16:58] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @queequegtheater all Spears are javelins if you try hard enough
[1:17:02] <ds3namecaldara> BIG STRONK Regarth The barbarian
[1:17:05] <anachronologist> Sorcery play-through's are fun as hell
[1:17:07] <+ItsSansom> Trident is like 3 spears in 1
[1:17:12] <QueequegTheater> @abelincoln_catpuncher No that's not how javelins work
[1:17:16] <Darren716> @pennykettle_ I meant my hour grinding shards lol
[1:17:23] <AvroEltz> Fuck farming for large, i just farm souls and get them at the giant smith
[1:17:26] <photoniccaster> Reggarth the Boar Knight!
[1:17:30] <+patriotrenegade> Id do Darkroot first personally, buff up as much as possible before Capra
[1:17:35] <pennykettle_> Darren716 oh csbeastRichard
[1:17:39] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> lolololololol
[1:17:52] <%ozzrabbit> So… we’ve established that spears are actually pretty common in mythology then?
[1:17:53] <Darren716> Darkroot tho
[1:17:55] <oda_flobunaga> With Drake, he can Body the Taurus no problem
[1:18:01] <toulon_somberjade> Yeah
[1:18:05] <+ItsSansom> Yeyeyeye
[1:18:07] <+Shishi1205> watch the BK from darkroot drop his weapon first try
[1:18:11] <%CateHecate> SKELETON WARRIORS
[1:18:15] <Equirah> @patriotrenegade that's less buff and more startegy
[1:18:16] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:18:16] <brunoberserk> grass crest shield tho
[1:18:27] <%glaciomaniak> get the sheild
[1:18:29] <pixel_river> piggy snout
[1:18:31] <Treasure_Vault> Zwei is in storage, not grave. What else is in there?
[1:18:32] <@Solidus_113> the best shield you never use
[1:18:39] <ds3namecaldara> BK halberd breaks Reggie's first playthrough would be amazing
[1:18:40] <bobxmaker> also i recommend trying rapiers because they aren't exactly the normal weapon and it isn't something you can go unga bunga with exactly.
[1:18:42] <%Indigo_Automaton> And Lower Undead Burg
[1:18:57] <%CateHecate> god the lower undead burg is SUCH a shithole lmao
[1:18:58] <nailwind> Woolie wants that Capra
[1:19:00] <+patriotrenegade> Reggie getst he BG Glaive but he hates long weapons so he doesnt use it
[1:19:00] <@Solidus_113> lower burg is the door around solaire
[1:19:00] <brunoberserk> and the butterfly is a easier boss , so free souls
[1:19:02] <Xaeveax> This is gonna be good.
[1:19:03] <pixel_river> does reggie know there is a solaire amiibo
[1:19:04] <%CateHecate> and it leads to a literal shithole!
[1:19:04] <+ItsSansom> No titanite boi today
[1:19:04] <EternalPunishment> uchi GG
[1:19:05] <ds3namecaldara> The iron round shield is really good
[1:19:06] <elshadow7> BK halberd would be amazing, don't know if reggie will fancy it though
[1:19:16] <%cobalt_phoenix_> BIG STRONG
[1:19:22] <elshadow7> He seems more like a swords guy
[1:19:22] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> YUP
[1:19:25] <AvroEltz> 2 hand it
[1:19:28] <+Shishi1205> t
[1:19:29] <anachronologist> CLAYMORE bitches
[1:19:32] <%Solidnick18> big strong
[1:19:36] <%trigunstar26> !uptime
[1:19:36] <@Moobot> @trigunstar26 WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 27 minutes
[1:19:41] <oda_flobunaga> @bobxmaker Ricard's rapier+ magic weapon = magey unga bunga
[1:19:41] <ds3namecaldara> BaeMore
[1:19:45] <+Shishi1205> you don't even have to like the halberd to know it's fucking broken
[1:19:47] <%CateHecate> it does surprisingly big damage
[1:19:50] <anachronologist> Fuck uo some Baldur Knights
[1:20:02] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> yeah test it in the Baller Knights
[1:20:02] <%CateHecate> works also on people that have bounced off your shield, too!
[1:20:09] <+Shishi1205> It also applies to you, counter hit DMG in souls gets you killed a lot of times
[1:20:11] <photoniccaster> You should human up before heading to lower undead burg Reggie
[1:20:16] <+Shishi1205> Specially in Bloodborne
[1:20:18] <ds3namecaldara> I used a crystal halberd in my first playthrough...then it broke LUL
[1:20:22] <QueequegTheater> Counter hit damage is such bullshit
[1:20:27] <pennykettle_> it would be fast to just sprint I think. need to check google maps
[1:20:31] <%glaciomaniak> so next game is probably DS2 but afterwards you think they're doing ds3 or bloodborne
[1:20:33] <anachronologist> Yeah dude, reverse Hallow
[1:20:34] <@Solidus_113> remember that sprinting puts you in the counter hit state too
[1:20:41] <bobxmaker> @oda_flobunaga any weapon+ magic weapon is unga bunga, just because ricards rapier has multiple stabs that works well with  magic weapon doesn't change that
[1:20:42] <anachronologist> You'll get big drops
[1:20:55] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @shishi1205 fighting the Undead Giant in lower Pthumeru Chalice BibleThump NotLikeThis
[1:21:10] <Heroes_of_Vale> Crystal weapons are such bait, but I'm kinda glad they exist. Despite me not using them, the idea is fun.
[1:21:10] <elshadow7> Just go back to burg bonfire
[1:21:14] <+Shishi1205> having the humanity gives more drop chance than turning human
[1:21:19] <dmtjinni> \(T)/
[1:21:31] <ds3namecaldara> Amigdalla one shot in that cursed lower chalice
[1:21:33] <anachronologist> FIGHT THE KNIGHTS
[1:21:38] <agustorm123> Just run it
[1:21:40] <Scorchfield> ether that or just go through undead burg and go through where taurus was
[1:21:44] <+Shishi1205> fuck the cursed chalice
[1:21:46] <pennykettle_> its a straight run from here
[1:21:47] <anachronologist> They are like carboards
[1:21:49] <+robertoszek> I believe
[1:21:49] <+ItsSansom> Gotta go fast
[1:21:57] <EternalPunishment> @ds3namecaldara Don't remind me. lol
[1:22:01] <Xaeveax> Cursed chalice was the hardest part of that game for sure.
[1:22:03] <+pupil31> AHHHH Kreygasm
[1:22:07] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> ugh god fuck cursed chalices
[1:22:11] <DSD24> running and running
[1:22:13] <anachronologist> BIG COWARDICE
[1:22:16] <+Shishi1205> that fucking flame watchdog
[1:22:18] <%cobalt_phoenix_> phew
[1:22:23] <ds3namecaldara> LUL Glad someone else knew my pain
[1:22:28] <Dopamien> oatsShook fuckshitfuckshit
[1:22:30] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> THEY WANT THE BOOTY REGGIE
[1:22:31] <peachy996> Yeah the getting hurt voice is posterchild for Kreygasm
[1:22:33] <+ItsSansom> And breathe
[1:22:35] <waltzqueen> @ds3namecaldara that fucking stalled me for literal years because i kept getting mad and leaving
[1:22:36] <+patriotrenegade> I had more trouble with Orphan my first time on NG+++ than the cursed chalices i think
[1:22:48] <Xaeveax> I managed to get watchdog in like 2-3 tries, but Ami down there took like 20
[1:22:52] <+Shishi1205> Orphan is such a fucker too
[1:22:56] <photoniccaster> The drake will leave so you are safe to cross the bridge
[1:22:56] <Qsmash_> I don't think I ever found that bonfire
[1:23:05] <elshadow7> It's crazy how you get to know every single inch of these areas
[1:23:14] <+patriotrenegade> Sometimes I oneshot cursed Amygdala and sometimes I die like 15 times
[1:23:19] <anachronologist> RUN IT
[1:23:22] <+pupil31> GAS GAS GAS
[1:23:25] <elshadow7> Run down the stairs
[1:23:28] <+patriotrenegade> Also FUCK fighting Ebrietas or Rom in a cursed chalice
[1:23:29] <peachy996> Cursed Amy FORCES you to learn the pattern you may not have learned in the main game
[1:23:29] <anachronologist> DO IT
[1:23:30] <pennykettle_> Yea I love backtracking and learning areas rather than teleporting from bonfire to bonfire
[1:23:30] <+Shishi1205> run
[1:23:35] <+ItsSansom> STEP ON THE GAS
[1:23:40] <bobxmaker> GAS GAS GAS GOTTA STEP ON THE GAS
[1:23:42] <ds3namecaldara> GAS GAS GAS I'm gonna step on the Gas
[1:23:44] <%mr_sups> Did he fight the titanite demon or no?
[1:23:44] <nailwind> the feeling of knowing the layout of the world like the back of your hand is the true reward Kreygasm
[1:23:46] <+pupil31> He chose violence
[1:23:47] <anachronologist> fuck em up
[1:23:48] <+Shishi1205> just bail
[1:23:50] <toulon_somberjade> Not when it flew off already
[1:23:52] <Xaeveax> @mr_sups Not yet
[1:23:54] <peachy996> You either learn the patter or get swatted in the last phase
[1:23:57] <+ItsSansom> YEAH YEAH YEAH
[1:24:17] <+pupil31> wow
[1:24:22] <elshadow7> Alright then
[1:24:22] <+pupil31> he late
[1:24:22] <+ItsSansom> As quick as a flash
[1:24:23] <@Solidus_113> lucky
[1:24:23] <+robertoszek> PogChamp
[1:24:24] <anachronologist> No Drake
[1:24:26] <EternalPunishment> did he get the dragon sword for hitting the dragon's tail with 15+ arrows?
[1:24:31] <elshadow7> Ye
[1:24:32] <ds3namecaldara> I'm gonna fight the kights! Tonight
[1:24:34] <+TheFrancix> he did
[1:24:34] <peachy996> Ebrietas with a hole in the room is the most off putting Chalice though
[1:24:35] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @EternalPunishment yea
[1:24:36] <EternalPunishment> nice
[1:24:39] <%amaranthos> Hello there

[1:24:55] <%livlinn> hello there! kyoryuLove
[1:24:55] <%hax_metatron> Solaire definitely has Daddy issues
[1:24:58] <shotguncrucifix> yo have you guys seen the sun? that shit rules
[1:24:58] <bobxmaker> if only i could be so grossly incandescent, such a line
[1:25:02] <Xaeveax> He'll certainly be grossly something eventually.
[1:25:03] <%Deekman> @WoolieVersus show him the sun trick
[1:25:10] <xjn_> lobosHype
[1:25:10] <ds3namecaldara> he does that's why we got along so well
[1:25:11] <+Shishi1205> I'm pretty sure solaire has some mental deficiency by staring at the sun 24/7
[1:25:11] <%CateHecate> solaire is a fed the way he's glowin
[1:25:13] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> Solaire you're not supposed to stare directly at it...
[1:25:18] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1455421207659139081?t=Np244HCpRXfSBOkB2__Gpw&s=19
[1:25:18] <+swesterly> Xae stfu
[1:25:18] <pennykettle_> its a remaster I doubt the visual bug is still there
[1:25:21] <%glaciomaniak> isn't solaire the missing son of gwyn or something
[1:25:25] <%Deekman> @WoolieVersus looking at the sun then turning the camera then looking again a couple times
[1:25:28] <+ItsSansom> Solaire's retinas melting
[1:25:31] <toulon_somberjade> Basically the Drake ether shows up or flies off and if it flies off it won't show up again till the area refreshes
[1:25:33] <elshadow7> Can you see that from here? I thought it was only at the basin?
[1:25:37] <+Shishi1205> get the lizard btw
[1:25:39] <Treasure_Vault> sparkling lizard near
[1:25:43] <@Solidus_113> @Deekman I don't think that happens anymore in the remaster

[1:25:49] <Crowroost> Staring at the sun too long makes you miss ladders
[1:25:51] <MightyOwl95> Item in the box

[1:27:42] <xjn_> HE GETS IT
[1:27:44] <teh_Question> Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[1:27:45] <dagreenpillow> I LOVE THE LEVEL DESIGN
[1:27:45] <%Grimlockfly> we love it
[1:27:48] <oda_flobunaga> ShortCussy
[1:27:49] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> it's free real estate
[1:27:50] <Treasure_Vault> This is the best part of DS1.
[1:27:52] <%CateHecate> isnt it amazing when someone actually had to design a level?
[1:27:57] <bobxmaker> this is why dark souls is the best souls game in the series according to me
[1:27:58] <pennykettle_> why cant they do this again? :(
[1:27:59] <Treasure_Vault> No other Dark souls game has the same interconnectedness.
[1:28:07] <anachronologist> Dark Souls has the best level design
[1:28:11] <EternalPunishment> shortcutss
[1:28:25] <%CateHecate> Street Sweeper
[1:28:30] <Treasure_Vault> Hopefully the shortcut porn in Elden Ring will be transcendental.

[1:28:40] <%Deekman> if you have the master key can you unlock that door?
[1:28:44] <+pupil31> monkaS
[1:28:50] <gryffinp> I think that more often than not a one-handed r2 will be a vertical/thrust where a r1 is horizontal, but its not a rule
[1:28:55] <DapperCadavr> here we go
[1:28:55] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @deekman no
[1:28:55] <pennykettle_> @Deekman I dont think so, its a one way door not a lock
[1:28:55] <shieldanvil> sex is great and all, but you ever open a shortcut in dark souls?
[1:28:57] <elshadow7> I haven't seen anything about Elden Ring, but I think it'll have the least shortcut porn of all imo
[1:28:58] <Crowroost> @Deekman nope
[1:29:01] <%cobalt_phoenix_> psaDogchamp
[1:29:03] <agustorm123> Is surely the best shortcuts
[1:29:03] <WerdIce> @Deekman Nah, only from the outside
[1:29:06] <+ItsSansom> Souls 1 has such a nice little web of a map

[1:29:13] <%Deekman> got it, must be thinking of another one. it's been a while lol
[1:29:14] <+Shishi1205> puppet time
[1:29:16] <+DreyfussFrost> They made Dark Souls 1 perfect and just could never replicate it. This one still has the best world by far. Makes me even more hype for Elden Ring, being an open world instead of spokes on a wheel.
[1:29:17] <%livlinn> doggo shiaCry
[1:29:17] <DSD24> Dog enemies are the worst
[1:29:19] <+patriotrenegade> break its bones fairly quickly

[1:29:21] <%CateHecate> the other thing DS1 does super well which i dont think any other fromsoft game ever did again: clank sound effects on your movement being hyper-detailed armor specific foley. i LOVE that shit

[1:31:33] <greatspaceadventure> yooo i love dark souls
[1:31:34] <+Jack8274> This armor is legit, low weight, high elemental resist
[1:31:36] <%CateHecate> locked in a room/maybe assasinated by griggs?
[1:31:45] <xjn_> 50% off on sorcerers
[1:31:49] <+askalta> imagine this becomes a crystal magic weapon claymore playthrough
[1:31:51] <MrMatternot> Briggs killed the sorcerer player
[1:31:53] <+eanscrale> gotta have a change of clothes I guess?
[1:31:57] <+JustToWatch> Barrel is cheap rent
[1:32:01] <gryffinp> note: this is woolie's headcanon
[1:32:03] <+swesterly> That is just Pat-canon
[1:32:04] <+Jiggisnipe> lol
[1:32:07] <anachronologist> LUL
[1:32:09] <%amaranthos> sorcerer more like scorcherer because you're a pyromancer get it
[1:32:10] <pennykettle_> this is all of our headcanons

[1:32:19] <DSD24> Meet their corpses
[1:32:19] <+Shishi1205> I also kinda believe this
[1:32:20] <+Jiggisnipe> it's fun headcanon
[1:32:21] <+ALazo> 'meet'
[1:32:22] <@Solidus_113> Wanderer makes it to BT
[1:32:22] <peachy996> Get in the barrel, Nerd
[1:32:24] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> it's a cool head cannon tho
[1:32:24] <gryffinp> to be fair most of this series is headcanon
[1:32:24] <QueequegTheater> 100% headcanon
[1:32:25] <%glaciomaniak> where theif die? wasn't it blighttown
[1:32:26] <+ItsSansom> It's headcannon, but there's nothing to disprove it. It's fun to think
[1:32:30] <+Jiggisnipe> Woolie did the same thing in DeS
[1:32:31] <haisho> is this the medieval equivalent of getting stuffed into a locker and forgotten?
[1:32:39] <peachy996> It's the DS equivalent of getting shoved in a locker
[1:32:42] <%CateHecate> @glaciomaniak theif is literally right down the road from here lol
[1:32:45] <seydaq> bandit went down like a legend
[1:32:50] <+Shishi1205> a lot die near blightown
[1:32:51] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @haisho that's called an oubliette
[1:32:51] <+kewlmyc> I like that headcanon.
[1:32:53] <pennykettle_> If it doesnt spawn the armor of the class you picked, it feels semi intentional
[1:32:53] <%CateHecate> isnt one of them in ash lake?
[1:32:55] <+patriotrenegade> Mages are nerds
[1:32:56] <MrMatternot> Deprived made it to Great Hollow
[1:33:02] <greatspaceadventure> is Vinheim like Yale for magicians?
[1:33:12] <+Jack8274> Almost all Dark Souls lore can be argued being head canon
[1:33:14] <agustorm123> NEEEEEERDS,!!!!!
[1:33:16] <%Bread_Assassin> What starter character made it the farthest?

[1:34:55] <Crowroost> Wonder if Woolie will have the deets ready to turn Reggarth on the magic path; dunno if he ever mentioned doing a sorc run himself
[1:35:01] <QueequegTheater> Be very careful pronouncing "Litng" out loud
[1:35:08] <daemonazaezal> pretty sure regarth is smart enough to use a sorcery
[1:35:10] <+tempestzephyr> Yur a Wizard, Reggie

[1:35:46] <MrMatternot> Bearenstein Bears?
[1:35:48] <daemonazaezal> there are weapon and shield spells in this game so it works in both hands

[1:36:33] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> lightning and great lightning speed for range, great combustion for close range
[1:36:39] <@Solidus_113> pine resin is basically free
[1:36:42] <+Shishi1205> spells eat slots tho
[1:36:43] <AbnormalVoid> Miracles are bomb and gun

[1:36:47] <@Solidus_113> also chaos flame spells

[1:36:54] <MrMatternot> Pyromancy teacher is not far.
[1:37:11] <QueequegTheater> Fully upgrading the pyro catalyst costs and getting all the spells costs like 65 levels worth of souls
[1:37:18] <lotharrio> Pyromancy's advantage i that it keeps your stat bloat at a minimum.
[1:37:20] <Xaeveax> How many deaths do we expect against Ol' Cappy? 1? 5? 15?
[1:37:22] <winner_92> me and the boys hanging out in the alley with our torches

[1:37:43] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @xaeveax I think he'll do it in 5
[1:37:47] <pennykettle_> Didn't DS2 have a respec item that if you used it wrong it just fucking set you back soul level 1
[1:37:47] <+ItsSansom> I think he'll get to Capra this run
[1:37:53] <QueequegTheater> STR-Faith gang rise up
[1:37:54] <Xaeveax> My money is on 4 deaths.
[1:37:58] <dundore77> technically you can off screen grind if you dont care about invasion/co-op levels if you are too "underleveled" like if he wants to try everything
[1:38:06] <+kewlmyc> Oh, the upcoming clusterfuck of a boss should be fun. What a odd one that was.
[1:38:06] <+ItsSansom> 3 Deaths

[1:56:47] <Chatterbox1991> Reggie into Scat confirmed
[1:56:48] <seydaq> spyCappa shhhh
[1:56:49] <+patriotrenegade> Use poop to counter the toxic the blowdart dudes deal
[1:56:49] <MrMatternot> You can poo bomb Cappie
[1:56:50] <winner_92> iirc the dung pie toxin actually hurts you less so you can use it to be immune to regular toxin
[1:56:51] <+tempestzephyr> it Hurts
[1:56:56] <+kewlmyc> Toxic is poison on steroids.
[1:57:05] <jetjagger222> cue scatman

[1:57:41] <AvroEltz> EAT. EAT DA PO PO
[1:57:41] <@Solidus_113> you throw it not eat it
[1:57:42] <%shakespearo> looking at the game's real currency right there
[1:57:43] <+RemedyofRevenge> @WoolieVersus This is a throwable toxic that can toxic the enemy and yourself. You don't eat it
[1:57:44] <nailwind> eat that onion and cry
[1:57:48] <MrMatternot> No eat
[1:57:50] <+Shishi1205> depends on your resist
[1:57:54] <@Solidus_113> you get toxic from it being in your hands
[1:57:57] <winner_92> do not eat da poo poo
[1:57:57] <%townzzzzz> eat shit
[1:57:58] <SethYuikora> poo grenade
[1:58:00] <%CateHecate> hey check out how hard i can eat this pile of shit
[1:58:01] <wqorst> let him play how he wants, if you wants to eat it let him
[1:58:05] <+nohiiro> eating dung pie is acceptable head canon imo
[1:58:06] <@Solidus_113> firebombs but actual shit
[1:58:06] <agustorm123> A good debuff
[1:58:07] <%shakespearo> doo doo stains on your hands make you all icky
[1:58:08] <%andrewofbob> It's a cream pie, but "chocolate"
[1:58:12] <+ReallyBigRocks> Dung Chucker Reggarth
[1:58:13] <lotharrio> Throw it straight up, back into his mouth.
[1:58:14] <KeiganOfAstora> It lasts longer if your bar is longer
[1:58:14] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @wqorst LUL
[1:58:14] <+kewlmyc> I remember you eat it in one of the games, or maybe I'm crazy
[1:58:16] <tech_nus> Wash your hands you filth undead
[1:58:22] <%jepupu> Dung Pie is mostly PvP trolling really
[1:58:25] <seydaq> good for dwayne johnson if your parry game sucks
[1:58:28] <%mr_sups> Stepped away. Did he fight Capra?
[1:58:33] <Crowroost> Smooth 'n Silky
[1:58:34] <@Solidus_113> no
[1:58:34] <LimitBreak_J> nope
[1:58:37] <KeiganOfAstora> It's counter-intuitive to have high resistance because when you do eventually get Poison or Toxic you want the bar to be small so it goes away more quickly
[1:58:39] <tech_nus> Nyet
[1:58:39] <+Bitscreed> Well it IS warm I suppose
[1:58:41] <%cobalt_phoenix_> REGGIE

[1:58:48] <%holydeviant1> Dung Pie can be used to give you a less-potent Toxic than what enemies can put on you

[2:00:49] <seydaq> can the pie bit the horrible goat demon?
[2:00:57] <+birddotexe> the rare 8th colour is magenta
[2:01:00] <JDebss> Prism stones are pleasant
[2:01:00] <pennykettle_> Its great in DS1 because you can mark areas and see them from other areas
[2:01:10] <%PlagueOfGripes> most people will only ever use them in one spot, ever, and then realize where it leads and never go there again
[2:01:12] <+kewlmyc> Never knew that
[2:01:15] <%holydeviant1> *survive the fall at full HP
[2:01:16] <LVL1_Scumbag> Also fun for decorating

[2:02:12] <MrMatternot> Poison arrow > Giants
[2:02:17] <%DarthFreeman> @WoolieVersus What kind of anime is Reggie emulating with his build?
[2:02:24] <VincentGraves> poison makes the archer section a cakewalk
[2:02:31] <+Bitscreed> The most I've ever seen prism stones used was in DS2 PVP, to mark out PVP arenas when "invading" a fight club.

[2:09:57] <pennykettle_> I love that the bosses for the Burg aren't native to the zone. They're just demons that wandered all the way up from Izalith, like how sometimes a mountain lion wanders into towns
[2:09:58] <+Shishi1205> that's 4 fire breaths on the bridge

[2:10:52] <pennykettle_> Firelink also gives 10 estus
[2:10:53] <+cdrom321> 10 estus vs 5.

[2:11:02] <TenorSounds> Just rest at Firelink, Reggie
[2:11:05] <okramv> he dont need 10 flaks
[2:11:06] <%Solidnick18> and you get 10
[2:11:12] <%PlagueOfGripes> honestly the extra 5 estus won't help him much. probably
[2:11:17] <%holydeviant1> I am confident
[2:11:21] <%CateHecate> despite being a playthrough killer, lets agree: Capra is such a sick character design
[2:11:24] <SethYuikora> imagine having time to drink 10 timesat Capra
[2:11:30] <+extradopeness> yeah its not really a game changer for capra
[2:11:32] <pennykettle_> I also vastly miss the kindling system opposed to the later games slowly handing you shards
[2:11:37] <Darren716> Estus isn't too helpful with Capra, you're either dead or you're not
[2:11:43] <%holydeviant1> @CateHecate Very intimidating
[2:11:47] <%Grimlockfly> @PlagueOfGripes yeah, eitther him or the demon or drop before you finish all 10

[2:16:36] <%holydeviant1> Magic weapon always handy
[2:16:38] <MrMatternot> Rickhart thinks Griggs is a Ponce.
[2:16:39] <winner_92> i love making my weapon glowy
[2:16:44] <+robertoszek> LUL love it
[2:16:46] <gryffinp> I've tried magic sword builds a handful of times in souls games and honestly I feel like they're never really that fun unless you're unlocking super-cheese
[2:16:46] <%gatorafan> waaaah
[2:16:54] <lotharrio> The weapon buff spells are basically always good.
[2:16:56] <+Shishi1205> how many slots are there in total?
[2:17:01] <%shakespearo> DS3 had a nice purple glow, that was rad
[2:17:03] <+Shishi1205> imagine all fireballs lmao

[2:17:10] <brunoberserk> chris pratt confirmed to be the voice of elmo , the cat
[2:17:17] <cyberspacecat> I've missed most of this PT, does Reggie do any magic?
[2:17:18] <%holydeviant1> er
[2:17:21] <SethYuikora> not like that, no
[2:17:22] <winner_92> wait wouldn't the enchant on one go away when you unequip it LUL
[2:17:25] <+RemedyofRevenge> holstering your weapon/shield removes the buff @WoolieVersus
[2:17:26] <%holydeviant1> Actually that doesn't work!
[2:17:27] <seydaq> only ds2
[2:17:28] <lotharrio> @cyberspacecat He's a pyro so far
[2:17:28] <%Order_of_Mystery> doesn't work that way until 2
[2:17:30] <agustorm123> Chris Pratt is the chosen undead
[2:17:30] <daemonazaezal> When you trade weapon it kills the enchant
[2:17:32] <%Lion_kun> Uselesssss
[2:17:32] <gryffinp> you can't actually have a magic shield and magic sword at the same time though, because when you put away your shield to take out your left hand catlyst the buff goes away
[2:17:34] <MrMatternot> @shinichizio 10 spells. You can have 4 different kinds of fireballs
[2:17:34] <daemonazaezal> only one or the other
[2:17:35] <Raldavar> Stability boost kind of good
[2:17:37] <SethYuikora> you'd have to use Aromatic Ooze for the weapon
[2:17:38] <cyberspacecat> oh nice, lots of fun pyro spells
[2:17:41] <%holydeviant1> It kills the enchant when you swap
[2:17:41] <+askalta> you can with resin
[2:17:42] <%ozzrabbit> That doesn’t work…
[2:17:43] <lotharrio> When gear is put out of you hand it loses buffs
[2:17:44] <pennykettle_> shucks
[2:17:45] <winner_92> you can't have both at once in this game unfortunately
[2:17:49] <shinichizio> @MrMatternot Tab-complete got ya
[2:17:50] <Crowroost> Chris Pratt confirmed as the noise made by Aural Decoy
[2:17:54] <Wofoeh> Oh that won’t work, by putting the weapon away you remove the buff @woolieversus

[2:18:14] <%Order_of_Mystery> *mentally urging Reggie to use sorceries in this game*
[2:18:21] <%dreadedcthulhu> also boosts pyromancy
[2:18:25] <@Solidus_113> those rings work on pyro too
[2:18:29] <winner_92> sorceries are so broken in this game
[2:18:30] <%holydeviant1> I like running with buff sorceries myself
[2:18:30] <MikeyxStyles> Chris pratmen
[2:18:31] <+TheFrancix> ALSO FOR PYRO
[2:18:31] <Darren716> Raw 20% boost to all spells and pyros
[2:18:32] <%ozzrabbit> It’s a shame it only works of your sword or shield is a catalyst in and of itself

[2:19:55] <pennykettle_> That was a big aspect of Demon's Souls lore right?

[2:26:39] <gryffinp> he hates the claymore, really
[2:26:42] <tech_nus> Oooh he lvl his sword
[2:26:44] <+patriotrenegade> Wall 1 down
[2:26:44] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Good thing you had that shield, more like.
[2:26:45] <jett_eyes> Capra Demon's a bitch
[2:26:46] <MightyOwl95> One shotting dogs really helps
[2:26:48] <cyberspacecat> did Reggie pick the master key btw?
[2:26:51] <+parazoa42> big sword really helps with the dogs
[2:26:51] <Arqartur0> Fuck yeah!
[2:26:53] <Darren716> The dogs are the real fuckers
[2:26:55] <%holydeviant1> Really, his gear was a huge advantage
[2:26:55] <SethYuikora> the stairs make the fight a joke if you can deal with the dogs

[2:26:59] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I LOST SO MANY POINTS
[2:26:59] <+robertoszek> the stability helped A LOT
[2:26:59] <%Deekman> @cyberspacecat nope witches ring
[2:26:59] <Arqartur0> SeemsGood SeemsGood SeemsGood
[2:26:59] <nailwind> BIG UPSET
[2:27:00] <%LurkerKraid> I quit dark souls becauce of capra
[2:27:01] <gryffinp> a LOT of bosses let you block in this game
[2:27:04] <glass_marcus> Stability and poise is the way
[2:27:04] <%Lion_kun> Fuck the tiny room.
[2:27:06] <Xaeveax> Very well played
[2:27:06] <+RyTYoung> I LOST ALL MY POINTS NOOO REGGIE
[2:27:07] <+Catpurnicus> damn I just got here
[2:27:07] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[2:27:08] <%CateHecate> Most bosses you can tank with blocks so long as you have the stability and stamina!
[2:27:13] <+Shishi1205> Can you?
[2:27:14] <%Grimlockfly> this arena is too small and fuck that tree
[2:27:15] <gryffinp> ...CAN you parry captra?
[2:27:15] <brunoberserk> capra is a noob destroyer
[2:27:16] <nailwind> biggest point upset LUL i didnt ge to vote in time
[2:27:17] <jett_eyes> WHAT
[2:27:17] <winner_92> wait you can parry capra??????
[2:27:18] <%Lion_kun> You can't parry Capra
[2:27:18] <+tempestzephyr> the dogs add a lot of pressure
[2:27:19] <@Solidus_113> can YOU
[2:27:19] <glass_marcus> welllll kinda
[2:27:20] <+Catpurnicus> reggie burning through this game
[2:27:20] <+Awkward_Cyborg> i think you can't
[2:27:21] <%PlagueOfGripes> you can't riposte though I think
[2:27:22] <Johannen> You cannot Parry
[2:27:22] <MrGreed93> you can't parry capra
[2:27:23] <jett_eyes> YOU CAN
[2:27:24] <%holydeviant1> I don;t think capra can be parried
[2:27:26] <+robertoszek> big lie
[2:27:27] <Davimotion96> Are you sure???
[2:27:31] <tech_nus> Pyro time
[2:27:31] <jett_eyes> you cant
[2:27:31] <OblivionSword1> wait is Capra parryable ??
[2:27:32] <Scorchfield> as long as you can kill the dogs in one swing capra isn't too bad
[2:27:33] <+Rasheedt> bruh
[2:27:35] <cyberspacecat> sadly no parry
[2:27:36] <Pubstar_LTD> You can parry but not riposte, im 100% sure
[2:27:36] <Johannen> Woolie the Liar
[2:27:38] <%Lion_kun> Only the final boss can be parried.
[2:27:41] <oneimportantthing> Ah yes, the next boss
[2:27:42] <Grunkle_Dan_> i dont think you can parry him...
[2:27:42] <QueequegTheater> Capra is not parryable
[2:27:43] <Heroes_of_Vale> It's not worth attempting, really
[2:27:45] <sendart> dont think you can riposte
[2:27:49] <yomamma133713> you cant parry capra
[2:27:49] <agustorm123> Great fight
[2:27:50] <%CateHecate> he comes out the gate with the dunk, it sucks
[2:27:52] <sendart> technically everything can be parried
[2:27:53] <winner_92> The Capra Demon's one handed attacks can be parried, but the only effect of a successful parry is the attack ignores you.
[2:28:00] <Pubstar_LTD> @yomamma133713 You can, but cant riposte
[2:28:00] <slix3431> FUCK I missed the Goatman
[2:28:01] <+Jiggisnipe> Reggie stayed so calm even on the 1st try
[2:28:06] <+Rafraud> You can parry it chat
[2:28:11] <%glaciomaniak> he's gonna have a tough time even blocking the next boss lol
[2:28:18] <Spearweaver> poise helps so much in this fight
[2:28:26] <nailwind> Capra has made people quit
[2:28:28] <linSP> Oh shiiiit I just made 100k wooliebux
[2:28:29] <Spearweaver> you just get destroyed without it
[2:28:29] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:28:29] <seydaq> that helmet was mvp
[2:28:33] <%hiswill98> Lots of people give up here
[2:28:35] <yomamma133713> @yomamma133713 yes but woolies referring to ripostes as parrys so i am too
[2:28:38] <taeko_ohnuki> Believers, I kneel
[2:28:38] <tech_nus> You can and the normal capras are easier
[2:28:40] <+RyTYoung> The dogs do not help that situ
[2:28:42] <agustorm123> Is fair tho
[2:28:46] <cyberspacecat> dogs are so brutal, or ..can be
[2:28:46] <seydaq> team hyper combo
[2:28:52] <%Sarevic> Dogs are the real boss of Capra
[2:28:52] <+kewlmyc> The dogs are the actual boss fight Kappa
[2:28:54] <ds3namecaldara> boar hat mvp
[2:28:54] <+Rafraud> The doggos are the real boss
[2:28:58] <+robertoszek> the stability from the shield saved the day
[2:29:00] <DuckfishPrime> The fight is basically decided in the first 10 seconds.
[2:29:05] <pennykettle_> you can also stand on the archway to the right of the stairs
[2:29:05] <+Bitscreed> The legend of Reggarth grows and continues...
[2:29:11] <+RemedyofRevenge> @WoolieVersus the balder shield is also an EXCELLENT shield due to it having more than 60 stability. Reggie had great equipment planning for this fight
[2:29:16] <winner_92> the real boss is the dogs. once they're gone it's not too hard
[2:29:18] <%dreadedcthulhu> first time I won this i cheesed him with plunging attacks
[2:29:19] <nailwind> this is a gacha fight of whether youll get fucked at the start or not
[2:29:26] <penitentpendant> I can't wait for the next podcast: "So Reggie beat Capra in two."
[2:29:27] <%Dakuu75> Don't forget to breathe Reggie my man~
[2:29:30] <oda_flobunaga> One of the Best boss arenas in the series, also one of the worst
[2:29:32] <%Grimlockfly> aaaaaaw ye
[2:29:34] <tech_nus> Kill the merchant
[2:29:38] <%Grimlockfly> Reggie be rollin depths now
[2:29:39] <jett_eyes> well he DOES become a regular enemy later
[2:29:42] <slix3431> Enjoy the freshair while you can Reg
[2:29:44] <+Shishi1205> @tech_nus he is dead
[2:29:50] <%CateHecate> time for poop
[2:29:50] <%jepupu> Reggie was super stacked and geared up for this stage for sure
[2:29:51] <tigerfang86> the TRASH ZONE
[2:29:51] <jett_eyes> same with Taurus
[2:29:54] <cyberspacecat> time to get filthy
[2:29:59] <+extradopeness> i love how small it is here it feels like an old school CV boss
[2:30:05] <benupde287> This is my favorite zone coming up
[2:30:08] <%holydeviant1> Reggie not panicking, having the claymore (W I D E sweeps) and the shield with 60+ stability did this, not to mention his more-than-zero poise avoiding doglock
[2:30:11] <%shakespearo> time for fun fog
[2:30:16] <SethYuikora> making good progress
[2:30:16] <+rheviel> key ring getting jingly
[2:30:17] <LunarRemix> Maybe Homeward bone?
[2:30:17] <seydaq> crisp rat incoming
[2:30:19] <Darren716> Honestly may wanna hold on the depths a bit since it's a long trip back to the other areas around here he may want to explore, notably Darkroot
[2:30:21] <penitentpendant> He already has the ring for it
[2:30:28] <gryffinp> well.
[2:30:30] <+Shishi1205> @WoolieVersus Darkroot b4 going further down?
[2:30:30] <tech_nus> @Shishi1205 did he like the blade?
[2:30:31] <%Seancicle> はん↗️はん↘️はん↙️はん↗️
[2:30:33] <gryffinp> most people need that key.
[2:30:34] <+askalta> master key
[2:30:34] <%dreadedcthulhu> *technically*
[2:30:35] <SethYuikora> master key would like a word
[2:30:36] <+Shishi1205> @tech_nus yes
[2:30:36] <%Deekman> @WoolieVersus you could use the master key to skip this
[2:30:37] <Heroes_of_Vale> It's funny whenever you get the capra sword to drop here.
[2:30:38] <AvroEltz> Well, not really
[2:30:39] <%holydeviant1> Capra is optional, but it's REALLY roundabout
[2:30:40] <pennykettle_> technically the depths are half of blight town are entirely optional
[2:30:42] <tigerfang86> most people need the key
[2:30:47] <+askalta> I skipped the depths my first playthrough
[2:30:49] <@Solidus_113> you can't master key to skip the depths door
[2:30:53] <emeraldskrull> woolieDATTEBAYO_HF woolieDATTEBAYO_HF woolieDATTEBAYO_HF
[2:30:55] <@Solidus_113> I tried
[2:31:01] <pennykettle_> you can go to the valley of drakes to skip the depths
[2:31:02] <winner_92> you can go the back way into blighttown which effectively skips it
[2:31:05] <%Deekman> @Solidus_113 yeah you can, go through the back way
[2:31:08] <%holydeviant1> @Solidus_113 You can skip to lower blighttown tho
[2:31:08] <%shakespearo> you can go the other way to BT though
[2:31:09] <+Shishi1205> you can skip to blightown via new londo
[2:31:14] <Johannen> But you can skip all of the depths with MasterKey
[2:31:14] <seydaq> master key dont work. need capra 4 +10
[2:31:15] <%Lion_kun> Reggie is making good progress
[2:31:17] <pennykettle_> LUL
[2:31:17] <+askalta> enter blight town through valley of drakes you don't need the key
[2:31:18] <+RemedyofRevenge> you can skip depths entirely, but you miss out on the ember
[2:31:25] <%shakespearo> you can't open the Blighttown door from the other side
[2:31:27] <@Solidus_113> it's a different route, so you miss a bunch of shit
[2:31:29] <pennykettle_> This game has badass skips
[2:31:29] <tech_nus> Can you reverse open the depths from blight town @Solidus_113
[2:31:35] <%Deekman> @WoolieVersus you'd need the master key
[2:31:36] <photoniccaster> Heheheh
[2:31:40] <%shakespearo> @tech_nus nope
[2:31:42] <SethYuikora> HEY, how'd they respawn?
[2:31:44] <pennykettle_> You don't actually need the master key
[2:31:45] <winner_92> you can't get into the depths from blighttown if its not open
[2:31:47] <cyberspacecat> the back door into blighttown, you just simply get an easier path
[2:31:54] <+extradopeness> i skipped so much my first run of this game
[2:31:55] <%hiswill98> I like to think of this game as a Metroidvainia in terms of level layout
[2:32:01] <+DreyfussFrost> You can, but imho having the master key on a first run just ruins it anyway.
[2:32:02] <cyberspacecat> but yes you need capra to get into *Depths*
[2:32:02] <%Bread_Assassin> Can you withou the Master key?
[2:32:08] <tech_nus> So you can skip the depths altogether
[2:32:11] <seydaq> @sethyuikora set firelink does that when you get too far
[2:32:15] <jett_eyes> yeah you can completely skip the depths by going through Darkroot into the Valley of Drakes
[2:32:21] <cyberspacecat> you can also skip capra without master key
[2:32:22] <pennykettle_> ohhh hmmm
[2:32:23] <+Mendin> He doesn't -need- the master key but that means going through the basin & valley
[2:32:23] <OblivionSword1> yeah it's weird
[2:32:23] <Iza_kku> i have had that happen here too
[2:32:24] <%cobalt_phoenix_> it's annoying
[2:32:24] <%PlagueOfGripes> no?
[2:32:26] <T_Doobie> certain zone transitions do that
[2:32:29] <+Rafraud> Is it cause of boss kill?
[2:32:32] <LunarRemix> That's if you go far way enough so that the zone unloads
[2:32:32] <seydaq> distance
[2:32:35] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus That happens if you get too far away from the map cell where the enemies appear.
[2:32:37] <%PlagueOfGripes> Enemies will respawn if you go through enough zones and then return
[2:32:39] <%holydeviant1> soooome bosses do a bonfire reset on distant areas
[2:32:43] <+Bitscreed> Huh. I never noticed that but it's totally obvious watching this
[2:32:44] <%shakespearo> I don't remember that ever happening to me, strange
[2:32:44] <lotharrio> Area reloaded.
[2:32:44] <%PlagueOfGripes> That's the ONLY case
[2:32:48] <penitentpendant> It's sort of like Metroid, go enough rooms away and they respawn
[2:32:49] <photoniccaster> It happens when you leave a zone into a new one
[2:32:50] <Spearweaver> is that a remastered thing?
[2:32:50] <winner_92> plague is correct
[2:32:51] <cyberspacecat> it's capra or black knight
[2:32:57] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus It's not supposed to happen, but it's a result of the game code's limitations.
[2:33:03] <youngking_kush> That's crazy
[2:33:03] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> it happens if you leave a new zone and come back
[2:33:04] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> You have to go a long way without sitting at a bonfire for that to occur
[2:33:04] <UberWolfman> Its because you went through the bosses fog door
[2:33:04] <TigerClaws12> it's distance based @WoolieVersus
[2:33:08] <ds3namecaldara> seen it too it's loading the zone weird
[2:33:11] <+bluedude153> That requires you going through several zones and walking back
[2:33:19] <+Shishi1205> @WoolieVersus You could tell Reggie that jump attack ignores some physics btw, like hitting through walls
[2:33:22] <LunarRemix> He's close enough to the Pyromancer so maybe suggest to him holdin on the souls?
[2:33:29] <@Solidus_113> 10 int for magic weapon
[2:33:32] <+extradopeness> catacooms
[2:33:33] <seydaq> this game was built with gum and paperclips. these things happen
[2:33:34] <%CateHecate> AW YEAH THE HAIRCUT SQUAD
[2:33:38] <%holydeviant1> I'd suggest pumping Attunement if you want sorceries, Reggie
[2:33:43] <ds3namecaldara> which isn't hard in 1 because all the areas are stacked. happens in Bloodborne too
[2:33:47] <alroy909> oh haircut squad is here
[2:33:48] <%Lion_kun> Reggie should be investing dex and str to invest in that BKS
[2:33:52] <%holydeviant1> Need space to have options
[2:33:53] <@Solidus_113> also yeah Haircut's crew is here
[2:33:56] <+Shishi1205> Also yeah enemies do respawn if you go far enough
[2:33:57] <slix3431> Reggie. If you're ever Crestfallen. Remember that the boss I had the hardest time with was Pinwheel
[2:33:58] <pennykettle_> Woolie I think Petrus's crew should also have appeared now, and Frampt snoring can be heard now, if you havent heard that already, I might have missed it
[2:33:59] <+askalta> reggie will love Magic weapon
[2:34:00] <winner_92> reggie should be investing in whatever the fuck he feels like
[2:34:04] <+extradopeness> buncha catacoomers
[2:34:07] <%PlagueOfGripes> fuck yeah, here comes the morons
[2:34:16] <%Lion_kun> I worry he's gonna become a round stone and spread those points too much.
[2:34:19] <seydaq> does he ever leave?
[2:34:23] <AvroEltz> i will not sit here and rot, as he proceds to sit there and rot
[2:34:27] <MrMatternot> You can miss Logan
[2:34:30] <slix3431> The purple furry is here
[2:34:41] <+Shishi1205> souls classic
[2:34:46] <+Jiggisnipe> yea
[2:34:52] <+Jiggisnipe> it's about having something to do
[2:34:57] <MrMatternot> NPCs are their own persons
[2:35:00] <cyberspacecat> usually everything works out :)
[2:35:01] <JetpackMcQuack> they're playing their own game
[2:35:06] <MrMatternot> Go talk to Rickhart
[2:35:10] <+askalta> only said that because he used light weapon in des. cmw is an equivalent
[2:35:15] <%PlagueOfGripes> Mumbles and Fucknugget
[2:35:25] <greatspaceadventure> the thing woolie just described is a good demonstration of how this type of mechanic is the pinnacle of interactive storytelling imo
[2:35:45] <MeImoth> Cataslys is correct for Sorcerys
[2:35:45] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:35:58] <Anderobot> I really hope they remember to chat up the cleric party
[2:35:58] <pennykettle_> I love NPCs having their own adventures but it went too far in DS3
[2:36:10] <winner_92> i think the npc quests in this game are the best set
[2:36:18] <%Lion_kun> My experience is the more mechanics you fumble with, the more you fuck up at crucial moments.
[2:36:31] <winner_92> there's a few that pretty much everyone will see and there's some that require extra thinking or just looking it up
[2:36:37] <seydaq> solaire quest tho NotLikeThis
[2:36:46] <MrMatternot> Reduce damage from falls can save you in Hollow
[2:36:47] <pennykettle_> I think the NPC quests are best in this one because you do often backtrack to areas whereas in later games you warp around so you would never think to check some places
[2:36:50] <+extradopeness> 10 INT? cyberpunk goblin mode
[2:36:50] <+askalta> Reggie is so woke
[2:36:52] <%Lion_kun> As someone who ran a faith/intelligence hybrid build in DES, I speak from experience.
[2:36:59] <winner_92> @pennykettle_ yeah that's true as well
[2:37:03] <bacon_209> do something new
[2:37:03] <+Awkward_Cyborg> like gandalf
[2:37:05] <slix3431> Reggarth is a dweeb
[2:37:10] <+Shishi1205> yeah
[2:37:10] <%cache_22> Reggie going for that Gandalf the White play style.
[2:37:10] <slix3431> Readin books over here
[2:37:32] <gryffinp> Infused
[2:37:34] <+extradopeness> i have never used sorcery in anything but DS3
[2:37:35] <@Solidus_113> doesn't work on boss weapons either
[2:37:38] <%shakespearo> you'll be able to buy the same shit, but fire soon as well
[2:37:41] <+Shishi1205> true
[2:37:44] <winner_92> i never understood why they didnt let you enchant infused weapons
[2:37:49] <@Solidus_113> or drake sword
[2:37:55] <seydaq> ds2 is better for this
[2:37:57] <cyberspacecat> balance
[2:37:58] <WakeUpThrow> DS2 magic was pretty fun
[2:38:06] <JetpackMcQuack> cool
[2:38:08] <+askalta> u can
[2:38:19] <MrMatternot> Need attunent
[2:38:24] <+Shishi1205> I mean glitch resin swapping was in the game and you could see it destroyed HP
[2:38:28] <JetpackMcQuack> i'm here for the spellsword
[2:38:28] <%shakespearo> need spell slots as well
[2:38:29] <%jeanschyso> jeanschyso subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months, currently on a 11 month streak! 
[2:38:29] <winner_92> @cyberspacecat would it really be that unbalanced? surely not more than many things that are already in ds1
[2:38:34] <Monkeyweed21> did I miss Capra
[2:38:35] <+Shishi1205> tumbleweed was it
[2:38:44] <%shakespearo> @Monkeyweed21 yes, two-shot him
[2:38:45] <OblivionSword1> @Monkeyweed21 just missed it
[2:38:47] <+tempestzephyr> let's hope he uses his spells this time
[2:38:57] <bacon_209> I might as well rewatch Des
[2:39:02] <+セビー> would be wise to try the spells out you can cast now before investing into int
[2:39:20] <slix3431> Reggarth is larping now
[2:39:29] <pepinillomaton> Reggarth the claymore wielding mage/pyromancer pig knight
[2:39:31] <%Fefe41> big dick logan
[2:39:32] <%Seancicle> 📝🗓🗂
[2:39:35] <MrMatternot> Is butterfly soul item a catalyst?
[2:39:36] <+Shishi1205> You're gonna spread too thin
[2:39:39] <lotharrio> May you find your worth, in the waking world.
[2:39:42] <@Solidus_113> full quality build on the way
[2:39:44] <cyberspacecat> @cyberspacecat fair but y'know, buffs on top of buffs can get nuts pretty quick, maybe if they scaled it evenly or something
[2:39:44] <+Shishi1205> if you start leveling int
[2:39:44] <LunarRemix> But you'll have to commit to in intelligence
[2:40:02] <%dreadedcthulhu> attunement will be helpful for pyromancy as well
[2:40:13] <%shakespearo> finish the game with 40 in every stat
[2:40:18] <+extradopeness> 66 END
[2:40:19] <%Lion_kun> He did.
[2:40:21] <Johannen> If you want your sorceries to be relevant gonna need to pump that int a lot
[2:40:24] <slix3431> Has Woolie told Reggie that Pyro is not magic?
[2:40:29] <+Shishi1205> @slix3431 yes
[2:40:31] <winner_92> @cyberspacecat yeah that's possible. it just always felt like one more thing that made the weapon system more complicated and arcane while not actually adding much
[2:40:41] <slix3431> @Shishi1205 Thx!
[2:40:44] <seydaq> mock the nerds all you want, but they invented summoned swords
[2:40:50] <%dreadedcthulhu> seeing his equip load so low is so bizarre for me
[2:40:53] <@Solidus_113> at this level spells will do a little more damage than just using arrows
[2:40:56] <+セビー> actually, oolacile catalyst can let him cruise on low int for a while and pump phys stats
[2:40:57] <+extradopeness> what rings u got bithc
[2:41:02] <%dreadedcthulhu> I should do a skipless run some time
[2:41:15] <Johannen> Not for magic its not
[2:41:16] <+セビー> ivory oolacile*
[2:41:17] <seydaq> no
[2:41:19] <%shakespearo> that's not what dump stat means
[2:41:20] <+Shishi1205> big stamina
[2:41:27] <olaksi> dump stat?
[2:41:28] <%shakespearo> resistance is dump stat
[2:41:28] <%Lion_kun> Endurance is not as important for spellcasting
[2:41:29] <penitentpendant> "Pump Stat" might fit better?
[2:41:34] <oda_flobunaga> the opposite of dump stat
[2:41:36] <ForrestofFallenTrees> Only for heavy builds a lot of builds just go around those stats for damage
[2:41:49] <%dashrendar7> pump and dump
[2:41:50] <seydaq> just dont get hit woolieMIRIN
[2:41:50] <dundore77> Dump stat is the one you dont put points into/take points away from
[2:41:51] <%dreadedcthulhu> big hp and stam bars carry hard
[2:41:54] <Johannen> Endurance is not that important for magic casters, Attunment is more of that
[2:41:56] <+Darky04> glass canon
[2:41:57] <MeImoth> Woolie is confusing me with Dump-Stat and Dumb-Stat
[2:41:58] <Davimotion96> +1 VIT per boss killed is my go to.
[2:42:00] <+0neReeler> all str
[2:42:02] <SethYuikora> "This doin' numbers"
[2:42:05] <%shakespearo> @olaksi like, a DnD fighter can put few points in charisma, so it's the stat they dump
[2:42:07] <+xyxlzyzm> 20vit is totally fine if u can dodge halfway decent
[2:42:10] <JetpackMcQuack> baby steps
[2:42:12] <%shakespearo> they don't need it
[2:42:13] <AbnormalVoid> you have to build for big HP/Stam with non-scaling equipment
[2:42:14] <%dashrendar7> Dark Souls NFTs coming soon
[2:42:16] <winner_92> wow dump stat is a terrible name
[2:42:22] <+extradopeness> @shakespearo is your name a reference to the stranglers song No More Heroes
[2:42:24] <%TheBesteban> STR and END all the way for me. You can't outrun my greatsword
[2:42:27] <%Grimlockfly> keep in mind you can also find more pyro spells and find a lot of fun things in it without changing your bulky warrior path.
[2:42:27] <olaksi> @olaksi so isn't END the opposite
[2:42:28] <winner_92> my immediate thought when i hear dump stat is "dump points into it"
[2:42:30] <Spearweaver> vit/end 20/20 is plenty for a good chunk of the game
[2:42:36] <Monkeyweed21> has Reggie gone into Darkroot yet or are they gonna save that for later?
[2:42:42] <%shakespearo> @extradopeness Indeed!
[2:42:45] <+0neReeler> 💩stat
[2:42:46] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:42:46] <SethYuikora> a reasonable decision
[2:42:50] <daemonazaezal> Dump stats in DND and dump stats in DS are super different
[2:43:00] <+Shishi1205> yeah the definition of dump stat is the stat you put the least points to
[2:43:02] <+extradopeness> @shakespearo i like that!!!
[2:43:03] <+ManOfReason> Poop stat
[2:43:04] <afronooch> dump stat is where you dump your extra points
[2:43:05] <Davimotion96> Also, endurance stops giving you stamina at 40
[2:43:09] <daemonazaezal> Dump in DS = "Idk where to put this level but X is always good"
[2:43:10] <+DreyfussFrost> @olaksi Yeah in DS1 END is a pump stat, not a dump stat. Souls players just have their terminology backwards.
[2:43:18] <+askalta> that really depends
[2:43:20] <+RemedyofRevenge> a dump stat is a stat that belong in the dumpster
[2:43:25] <+cdrom321> @monkeyweed21 He hasn't been there, but I wouldn't sat that he's saving it.
[2:43:30] <seydaq> unless your a magician that can repair
[2:43:30] <brunoberserk> vit/20 was also my build in first ng , but ng+ i pumped to vit/30
[2:43:33] <+セビー> dump stat as a term can vary from person to person tbh, from what ive seen
[2:43:33] <%shakespearo> @extradopeness you are like, the fifth person to recognize it in 15 years of using the name, cool
[2:43:43] <Monkeyweed21> @afronooch thats a pump star, dump stat is something like resistance
[2:43:47] <olaksi> why would the terminology be reversed for a single RPG series though LUL
[2:43:47] <daemonazaezal> Dump in DND is "This stat is bad and i can take it all the way to like 8 without worry" aka Wizards and STR
[2:43:57] <SethYuikora> BUY MOSS
[2:43:57] <+セビー> some say dump all points into it, other say its the one you ignore
[2:43:59] <%gatorafan> there seems to be two schools of thought regarding dumping
[2:44:00] <AncyentMarinere> Dd he kill capra?
[2:44:01] <%shakespearo> why would I need cha, I hit things
[2:44:05] <afronooch> @gatorafan yeah

[2:45:37] <+DreyfussFrost> @daemonazaezal It's people new to RPGs trying to apply a term they've heard without context.
[2:45:38] <Monkeyweed21> @Bitscreed no it is, its the hint that Laurentius is in the depths
[2:45:51] <penitentpendant> To Haircut!

[2:58:26] <ds3namecaldara> it's the Butcher
[2:58:30] <%holydeviant1> Mildred is implied to be one of them that went all the way downstairs

[2:58:56] <gryffinp> mildred is just miyazaki's fetish
[2:59:04] <seydaq> shes a maneater, but not mildred
[2:59:04] <+Shishi1205> ds3 mildred
[2:59:05] <waltzqueen> @gryffinp isnt everything htough
[2:59:08] <AvroEltz> Gwyn is mildred
[2:59:08] <tenshi_q> Contrary to their androgynous/masculine appearance, the man-eating cooks of the Depths are female, as confirmed by the game's producer Miyazaki Hidetaka.   from the wiki
[2:59:09] <%Cozy90> woolieFABRICATION woolieFABRICATION
[2:59:17] <%jepupu> My most fond memories are from Demon's Souls, cosplaying as Mildred and invading people in Valley of Defilement
[2:59:18] <%shakespearo> @slix3431 the furtive pronoun, so easily forgotten
[2:59:22] <MrMatternot> Woohooo here she comes.....She's a Maneater.
[2:59:23] <TigerClaws12> Miyazaki baited Shindol into drawing Mildred, he won
[2:59:24] <%tank7013> No it's not Mildred, but all butchers are still confirmed to be women by Miyazaki himself. Because he thought it was funny
[2:59:24] <oda_flobunaga> Actually, regardless of their bits/ voices, we are just assuming their gender
[2:59:32] <cyberspacecat> literally a man eater
[2:59:32] <+RyTYoung> Getting corrected on the fly is fun for LP's LUL
[2:59:35] <+Shishi1205> @oda_flobunaga its confirmed
[2:59:38] <+RyTYoung> thanks chat
[2:59:39] <+Zaku_III> Different build, or Reggie playing?
[2:59:40] <+cdrom321> You knew that. You just forgot.
[2:59:44] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus The butchers being ladies is a meta thing. Miyazaki mentioned it in a radio interview, so it became canon.

[3:05:09] <%shakespearo> it's like mature zelda, chests are great
[3:05:12] <+paladinstarbuster> It is shortened by Dex as well

[3:05:30] <+xyxlzyzm> they're bricks bro
[3:05:37] <%CateHecate> brown bricks
[3:05:41] <+askalta> you can cast with no stamina
[3:05:42] <TRZZXQ> we've had bricks for a few thousand years
[3:05:43] <%holydeviant1> And don't forget: fireballs don't have weight, they only stun on pure damage
[3:05:43] <ds3namecaldara> according to Pat by 2frames
[3:05:44] <+Shishi1205> mud bricks
[3:05:46] <+xyxlzyzm> idk what technological advances in the brick world u think we've had
[3:05:49] <penitentpendant> @shakespearo May there be something worth a 'chest message' in Elden Ring
[3:05:51] <tenshi_q> what's the brick lore?
[3:05:51] <slix3431> Naw naw, this isn't what medieval buildings looked like
[3:05:53] <noelsbedroom> i just found 50 bricks
[3:05:58] <%PlagueOfGripes> noscope
[3:06:02] <+xyxlzyzm> actually it is, i was there
[3:06:06] <@Solidus_113> aim the camera up and you can yeet spells further
[3:06:08] <HloyDerWurstverkaufer> cant play chess without a brick
[3:06:08] <+RemedyofRevenge> 12 bricks? on the side, of the road
[3:06:12] <$hattrick61> its a stone rectangle. not much to innovative
[3:06:13] <Dopamien> not much is made with real bricks these days FeelsBadMan
[3:06:13] <ds3namecaldara> now this pile of bricks!
[3:06:22] <%PlagueOfGripes> or just aim up and don't lock on at all
[3:06:22] <cyberspacecat> this feels like some pvp bs
[3:06:23] <JetpackMcQuack> locked the fuck on
[3:06:25] <%CateHecate> there it go! 12 bricks
[3:06:30] <+Shishi1205> freeaim too

[3:06:48] <TRZZXQ> also, the depths isn't 'medieval.'  It's fictional.  Brick development was different
[3:06:51] <+swesterly> WE HAVE TO COOK
[3:07:05] <slix3431> I'm so happy with my shitpost you guys
[3:07:11] <%Dakuu75> don't forget the seasoning
[3:07:14] <ds3namecaldara> watch Plague of gripes dark souls series
[3:07:20] <bear_breaker20> BA'am
[3:07:24] <glass_marcus> Reggie we need to Cook
[3:07:26] <slix3431> BRICK LORE
[3:07:34] <anachronologist> Boars Head Brand Reggie SeemsGood
[3:07:44] <+extradopeness> twelve!
[3:07:48] <%holydeviant1> Raw is like Drake sword
[3:07:50] <LunarRemix> Raw is a type like Fire and Lighting
[3:07:52] <AbnormalVoid> Raw is bigger base damage, and no scaling
[3:07:53] <+askalta> baby we like it raw
[3:07:59] <Dopamien> its fooken RAW
[3:08:07] <%jepupu> Raw = big scaling
[3:08:15] <seydaq> no scale pure bde
[3:08:15] <photoniccaster> There is an alternate path behind the table the butcher was at
[3:08:16] <cyberspacecat> no raw is no scaling
[3:08:17] <JetpackMcQuack> cash out
[3:08:21] <%Dakuu75> I always made a raw weapon until stats were higher later. at least in DS3
[3:08:23] <SethYuikora> Raw allows you to kill scaling for weapons that you don't want stats for.
[3:08:27] <ds3namecaldara> raw = Fuck scaling give me damage
[3:08:41] <tenshi_q> i forget, can you magic weapon raws?
[3:08:42] <cyberspacecat> it's pretty good but at some point scaling edges it out
[3:08:52] <KeiganOfAstora> Raw is stronger until you reach 25 or so in STR/DEX
[3:09:01] <MeImoth> problem with raw: it goes only to +5, there is no ontinuation after into the third tier
[3:09:06] <Dopamien> early vit + raw weapon is a nice early level invade build :)
[3:09:20] <JetpackMcQuack> hit them with the pointy side
[3:09:22] <ds3namecaldara> Crystal and raw are practically the same wow
[3:09:27] <anachronologist> Yeah. Having your main weapon in mind is great to build arround
[3:09:34] <+askalta> andre

[3:10:08] <derap41> you can get 2 if you're stupid lucky
[3:10:11] <cyberspacecat> doesn't it drop for the last killed cook?
[3:10:17] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Yup. It works the same way the Fang Boar Helm does.
[3:10:18] <anachronologist> Pump dat STRENGTH

[3:10:38] <Sonny_Firestorm> pretty sure Ymfah got a bug to get both in one playthrough... but nvm the gamebreaker
[3:10:40] <AbnormalVoid> BEST WEAPON
[3:10:46] <didipackums1> Sack is only for REAL players
[3:10:49] <MeImoth> I got 2 in one playthrough in about 1500h of playtime

[3:11:02] <DedlokPM> @cyberspacecat you are guaranteed 1. if you have not gotten one by the time you kill the last one in the game it will auto drop

[3:11:07] <derap41> yeah it has the best weight to defense ratio
[3:11:07] <seydaq> trade for bde

[3:25:18] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @anachronologist
[3:25:21] <+ElDragon_1> Stacked curse was nuts
[3:25:24] <%A_German_spy> @Bitscreed It's true. You could end up with just a sliver of max health left in 1.0. They patched it fairly late in the game's original release, too.
[3:25:38] <daemonazaezal> Stacked curse? you mean DS2?
[3:25:40] <+Bitscreed> @A_German_spy :O

[3:27:40] <seydaq> bodega time
[3:27:44] <%Juriasu> I never know what to say he phrases it so weirdly
[3:27:47] <mar_krow> Wat if he swung his sword
[3:27:58] <pixel_river> did the explanation on how to lift the curse appear in the vanilla version pre patch ?
[3:28:02] <seydaq> youre a pyromancer of course not

[3:28:18] <%CateHecate> bri'ish
[3:28:19] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[3:28:20] <penitentpendant> Cat: "Where's thou wert yet goeth?" Response: "Yes/No" Future Reggie: "UHHHHHHH."

[3:28:24] <Treasure_Vault> You haven't twas not yet ain't isn't essn't, no? YES/NO?
[3:28:24] <user_naim> Good preparation
[3:28:29] <+Jiggisnipe> he asked a negative question
[3:28:34] <+extradopeness> yes or no MF
[3:28:36] <Monkeyweed21> @pixel_river I dont think they told you the healer is in New Londo
[3:28:36] <AbnormalVoid> LUL
[3:28:39] <xjn_> laurentius you sly bastard
[3:28:39] <+Shady_Zaku> Yeah that was tricky dicky wording
[3:28:41] <LVL1_Scumbag> Fuck that cat
[3:28:41] <$eco419> No you can fix it
[3:28:41] <+Shishi1205> he stays there tho
[3:28:42] <anachronologist> Double Negative
[3:28:43] <tenshi_q> this is the REAL dark souls
[3:28:44] <photoniccaster> Not nearly as bad as the cat later
[3:28:45] <%DashXero> The "Yes Man" Check.
[3:28:46] <Dopamien> @Treasure_Vault NotLikeThis
[3:28:47] <cyberspacecat> does that lock you out? I forget
[3:28:48] <SethYuikora> Yeah nah yeah
[3:28:52] <Johannen> He does not fuck of, you can talk to him again and reengage
[3:28:52] <%cobalt_phoenix_> i did that but he stayed for me
[3:28:53] <+Shishi1205> you can talk to him again
[3:28:54] <+Jiggisnipe> or moreso he asked do you think something is bad
[3:28:57] <pixel_river> @Monkeyweed21  yeah right? i remeber meandering around confused
[3:29:01] <derap41> you do get a chance to change his mimnd
[3:29:01] <penitentpendant> @cyberspacecat No. I mashed and goofed. You get reasked.
[3:29:02] <MeImoth> he stays, at least in the current version
[3:29:04] <+extradopeness> yeah he wont leave
[3:29:06] <seydaq> kindled
[3:29:07] <+VictorVonLouche> You just talk to him again to correct the answer
[3:29:07] <+patriotrenegade> Is it not so that thou art new???
[3:29:08] <%A_German_spy> @cyberspacecat No, it doesn't. You can get the prompt by talking to him again.
[3:29:10] <+nohiiro> like alvina's dialogue prompt... i still dont know what tf she's on about
[3:29:13] <Xaeveax> You can talk to him again if you answer wrong
[3:29:15] <cyberspacecat> yeah thought so, scary tho
[3:29:23] <alroy909> some dialogues are really confusing **Alvina**
[3:29:26] <+Rafraud> I love this voice actor
[3:29:28] <%CateHecate> best lore bit, pyromancy and flame as a whole is just Life itself. so fuckin cool
[3:29:34] <derap41> Best boi herre
[3:29:35] <tolloponik> heh, imagine pyromancy being blocked off that would be crazy LUL
[3:29:40] <ds3namecaldara> Alvina LUL LUL LUL

[3:29:43] <pixel_river> 4Head

[3:29:44] <+eanscrale> It do be like that
[3:29:44] <seydaq> im a pyromancer, i already know dis
[3:29:47] <+Jaromero435> This guy has a good outlook on life
[3:29:47] <Monkeyweed21> @pixel_river yea i think it just said find a purging stone or healer and the only guy that sold purging stones was the healer in New Londo
[3:29:49] <%gatorafan> haha!
[3:29:54] <+extradopeness> what a jovial bastard
[3:29:56] <%Charronia> Turns into a zombie, life doesn't change at all cirLaugh
[3:30:04] <ds3namecaldara> or the Pardoner
[3:30:08] <Darren716> I believe if you say yes the first time he wont give you a free flame
[3:30:09] <%cobalt_phoenix_> I like this guy
[3:30:11] <ds3namecaldara> Ozwald
[3:30:13] <$eco419> Yeyeyeye
[3:30:15] <derap41> His Voice acting is soo good you can feel the social anxiety
[3:30:19] <anachronologist> Burn Baby Burn
[3:30:21] <penitentpendant> @Monkeyweed21 No, pardoner in the Parish by the bell
[3:30:21] <+nohiiro> Oswarudo
[3:30:22] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Class-specific dialogue!
[3:30:24] <user_naim> Pyromancers are so chill
[3:30:27] <MeImoth> but if you say "yes" the first time, he REPHRASES the questions so that then you HAVE TO actually say "YES"
[3:30:30] <mar_krow> What is his build idea so far
[3:30:32] <%cobalt_phoenix_> O R B
[3:30:32] <+RemedyofRevenge> reggie is the firestorm, and he's approaching
[3:30:34] <ArOne_Start> ORB
[3:30:35] <Johannen> CUMbustion babeeee
[3:30:36] <pixel_river> @Monkeyweed21  i just remeber it beaing the wosrt time in the game, esspecially with the cursed stacking on top xD
[3:30:36] <@Solidus_113> FLASH SWEAT
[3:30:41] <Monkeyweed21> @penitentpendant he didnt sell Purging stones at first they added that in a patch
[3:30:45] <anachronologist> COMBUSTION best spell
[3:30:46] <+swesterly> Moss lady sells purging stones but doesn’t Reggie already have one?
[3:30:48] <derap41> @mar_krow He ate the whole plate
[3:30:49] <seydaq> im all oiled up
[3:30:53] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> walk away when talking with NPCs to get custom dialogue
[3:30:55] <penitentpendant> @Monkeyweed21 Blessed that they did
[3:30:58] <KeiganOfAstora> Combustion is the best because it's fast, unlike everything else in this game
[3:31:03] <%jepupu> Higher INT gives you more slots to cast though
[3:31:08] <+Shishi1205> pyro only costs souls and slots
[3:31:12] <tolloponik> KeriayaE!!!
[3:31:13] <sendart> @jepupu nope
[3:31:15] <mar_krow> Ah lol
[3:31:21] <+Shishi1205> Attunement not int
[3:31:21] <GeoGio3> upgrade the flame
[3:31:22] <Darren716> jepupu Int doesnt give slots, adj does
[3:31:22] <seydaq> atn
[3:31:24] <%CateHecate> ITS A BUSTER WOLF
[3:31:24] <Darren716> *att
[3:31:27] <SethYuikora> pyromancy generally has rough attunement for stronger types or limited uses
[3:31:28] <dontleavemealone4toolong> @jepupu that's attunement
[3:31:28] <AvroEltz> Oh yeah, the pyromancer ability, SWEAT
[3:31:29] <anachronologist> Roy Mustang up in here, up in here
[3:31:29] <Johannen> @jepupu You mean atunment?
[3:31:44] <user_naim> I love that the pyromancers have all kinds of freak bullshit going on, like super sweat
[3:31:45] <%holydeviant1> Enemy strikes BOUNCE OFF YOU
[3:31:48] <penitentpendant> "What dodge roll?"
[3:31:48] <derap41> meme spell
[3:31:49] <ds3namecaldara> no stagger, no rolling
[3:31:53] <@Solidus_113> absolute tank
[3:31:53] <LunarRemix> A LOT of defense
[3:31:58] <Monkeyweed21> LOT OF DEFENSE
[3:31:58] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:31:59] <+Shishi1205> face fucking pyro
[3:32:04] <wqorst> nasty
[3:32:04] <seydaq> zangief hyper armour
[3:32:12] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Defense, a ton of poise, and a heavy deflection property on your body.
[3:32:20] <SethYuikora> become a literal tank
[3:32:23] <tolloponik> become melee player the spell
[3:32:24] <@Solidus_113> Flash Sweat is really good
[3:32:27] <derap41> Become a rock
[3:32:27] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus But it got nerfed, so now it only lasts about 20 seconds.
[3:32:31] <%cobalt_phoenix_> sweat so hard you burn less
[3:32:32] <seydaq> turn yourself into pig
[3:32:33] <+Shishi1205> oh bummer
[3:32:34] <ds3namecaldara> tank mode but kill it
[3:32:34] <LunarRemix> But you can't roll
[3:32:37] <ArOne_Start> become as Colossus from Xmen
[3:32:40] <%holydeviant1> All the inner-self pyromancies are incredibly useful
[3:32:41] <%CateHecate> smash bros shield
[3:32:49] <+Shishi1205> rock boi shield
[3:32:51] <%CateHecate> or actually, it's Aganos rocks
[3:32:55] <anachronologist> You want cumbustion
[3:32:58] <+askalta> it'd situational
[3:33:04] <seydaq> set yourself on fire is something else spyYum
[3:33:05] <Monkeyweed21> it trivializes stuff like the dance party in Undead Parish
[3:33:10] <anachronologist> Cubustin makes me feel good
[3:33:10] <Johannen> Combustion is great
[3:33:11] <+askalta> fire orb
[3:33:13] <%cobalt_phoenix_> 16 fireballs baybeee
[3:33:15] <$eco419> Don’t forget the upgrade the hand
[3:33:22] <derap41> lots of damage lots of utility
[3:33:23] <%holydeviant1> Fire Orb is BIG FIREBALL
[3:33:28] <Estuko> Pyromancy is hot
[3:33:32] <+extradopeness> yes reinforce the flame
[3:33:40] <%holydeviant1> better fire
[3:33:43] <derap41> scaling too
[3:33:45] <emptyantics> !uptime
[3:33:46] <@Moobot> @emptyantics WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 41 minutes
[3:33:51] <+SilverDevilfish> Pyromancy is Capitalism magic
[3:33:58] <@Solidus_113> flash sweat will save you some pain in izalith
[3:34:02] <Sonny_Firestorm> It gains a scalling.
[3:34:03] <%cobalt_phoenix_> that's for the hand strike though, right?
[3:34:03] <anachronologist> Use them soul items
[3:34:04] <emptyantics> Damn I missed the first 3 hours :(
[3:34:04] <%holydeviant1> Some of this is for swinging the fire like a weapon, btw
[3:34:05] <AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> Good job Moobot!
[3:34:07] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus The scaling only affects the damage it does when you punch someone with it.
[3:34:10] <vivaciouseff> the int scaling doesn't affect pyro tho
[3:34:15] <seydaq> and all this damage is available to lv1
[3:34:16] <mar_krow> Dex in this game increases cast speed right
[3:34:16] <lotharrio> That's punch damage scaling
[3:34:19] <+Shishi1205> True its bc its a weapon
[3:34:23] <MeImoth> NO, the scaling is JUST FOR YOUR PUNSH damage
[3:34:23] <mar_krow> ?
[3:34:25] <Monkeyweed21> no class starts with under 4 strength so its free
[3:34:29] <%holydeviant1> @mar_krow  a little
[3:34:31] <AbnormalVoid> intelligence DOES NOT affect Pryo
[3:34:45] <derap41> intelligent punch
[3:34:50] <AbnormalVoid> Brain Fist
[3:34:56] <Hamborgini> I cast Fist at the target
[3:34:57] <OblivionSword1> doing rekka with the flame hand
[3:35:00] <mar_krow> @holydeviant1 Thought so been a bit
[3:35:00] <tenshi_q> galaxy brain punch
[3:35:01] <newbthenovicegamer> smart punch
[3:35:03] <brunoberserk> '' POCKET SOULS ''
[3:35:05] <+askalta> it does make casts stronger
[3:35:05] <AbnormalVoid> I work out at the library fist
[3:35:09] <Sonny_Firestorm> Pyromancy is a left-hand tool?
[3:35:09] <derap41> got 2 slots already
[3:35:14] <newbthenovicegamer> big brain fisticuffs
[3:35:23] <+paladinstarbuster> cant do both
[3:35:24] <AbnormalVoid> good time to pop some soul items
[3:35:29] <Sonny_Firestorm> *Lefthand or Item?
[3:35:35] <%A_German_spy> @Sonny_Firestorm It can be equipped in either hand. Purely personal choice.
[3:35:35] <Johannen> Dirt cheap for now
[3:35:46] <%holydeviant1> Pyromancy explodes in potential once you meet larry
[3:35:48] <AbnormalVoid> not later on, it's very expensive lol
[3:35:48] <SethYuikora> combustion and iron flesh I'd recommend
[3:35:52] <ds3namecaldara> dex pyro strength pyro
[3:36:04] <Sonny_Firestorm> @A_German_spy So I can put pyro in right and parry dagger in left?
[3:36:07] <Futurecity10> I wish pyromancer stayed OP throughout Dark souls, Pyro in 2 and 3 is too much investment
[3:36:12] <anachronologist> BUSTIN makes me feel good

[3:36:52] <%A_German_spy> @Sonny_Firestorm You can, yes, and if you hit an enemy with something like Combustion while they're in the ripostable state after a parry, they'll take extra damage. Maybe not as much as you'd deal by riposting with a high-crit DEX weapon, but still more damage for your money.

[4:03:52] <+cdrom321> I thought it meant that he doesn't see any bosses to strip.
[4:03:53] <+ThomasOfTroy> I thought that was his hint for you to buy stuff before he'll talk
[4:03:53] <%hax_metatron> To get unique dialogue from him, buy anything from him and talk immediately before exiting the menu. @woolieversus
[4:03:54] <@Solidus_113> stinko crystals

[4:05:05] <MrGreed93> weapons upgraded along the crystal path can be upgraded, not the crystal weapons
[4:05:07] <%mihokspawn> Crystal stuff can be 'pined' or 'magic weaponed'
[4:05:16] <%A_German_spy> spyYuck
[4:05:17] <seydaq> good for when you havent upgraded and just want to clear out boss
[4:05:18] <%hiswill98> We just need to spin it, that’s all!
[4:05:19] <%Pillagius> Yeap. Upgrading the weapon will repeair the crystal weapon )
[4:05:20] <%Bread_Assassin> Never did and never will use a crystal weapon

[4:05:25] <%Deekman> the spare tire of weapons

[4:08:53] <glass_marcus> reggie doesn't give a fuck about andre's basement
[4:08:59] <tenshi_q> reggie hasn't even looked in the titanite demon room
[4:09:02] <KyberNasse> We dont go there anymore :)
[4:09:11] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus The helmet of this set is specifically based on one that was made for Henry VIII, which was rather creatively called... uh... the Horned Helmet of Henry VIII
[4:09:12] <+HeroSolaire> @glass_marcus lmao he probably didnt even see the hole
[4:09:15] <warpiscute> real sweats use crystal weapons in pvp for that little extra bit of damage

[4:13:47] <%Javaa01> Mashing helps probably the most against these goop enemies out of the whole enemy roster of the game
[4:13:52] <+patel347> you need iron ring
[4:13:54] <%jepupu> Here's where the bow & arrows come handy
[4:13:57] <vivaciouseff> left and right bumper mash will get you out of some grabs faster
[4:14:02] <+Shishi1205> @MeImoth Not true you can escape grabs by mashing too
[4:14:04] <DeathByPoke7> shimmy
[4:14:09] <+patel347> you need the ring to do it
[4:14:09] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts

[4:14:27] <Shwepie> @Rafraud DS2's fake bonfire is more of a cinematic thing so it isn't too bad. The real sin is that there are a few bonfires that aren't safe and you will die if you afk at them.
[4:14:28] <+patel347> i failed to bait it without the ring
[4:14:45] <+HeroSolaire> @vivaciouseff The animations dont change lol

[4:15:08] <Johannen> @swesterly He knows
[4:15:12] <+RyTYoung> We doin it
[4:15:13] <royb2> he doesnt want to because he's afraid of getting cursed again and wasting the purging stones
[4:15:23] <BigYanno> yeah but the bonfire is locked when you first pass it
[4:15:24] <vivaciouseff> @vivaciouseff Zullie has a whole video on it, mashing will get you out of grabs faster
[4:15:27] <%jepupu> Good grinding spot for large shards
[4:15:28] <%Grimlockfly> he's past the part that would happen
[4:15:36] <bobxmaker> he wouldn't get the bonfire because sewer key is at the giant rat

[4:15:38] <seydaq> no master key so no bonfire
[4:15:59] <+ReallyBigRocks> goasts

[4:16:28] <+Shishi1205> you punch fire
[4:16:29] <+HeroSolaire> why is he talking about new londo?

[4:17:05] <+patel347> I would say

[4:17:08] <+patel347> find the boss first
[4:17:09] <@Solidus_113> suggest heavier

[4:21:37] <+Jiggisnipe> Reggie wants to parry everything, I admire that
[4:21:40] <Arqartur0> Trigun indeed rules
[4:21:44] <%CateHecate> reggarth names himself after the rat of the lordran sewer, becoming reggie muad'dib
[4:21:49] <+HeroSolaire> Spider shield is borderline useless nevermind with that

[4:21:54] <+HeroSolaire> you barely use the poison resist
[4:21:59] <$Holycow8498> Rats do not want the smoke
[4:21:59] <+RJay80> Rat would be bottom tier if you could parry them :)
[4:22:03] <Arisato_II> Ratkind knew they couldn't change the food chain, so instead of reflecting on their kind, they attacked thr cat
[4:22:04] <%Sonicdy> If you parry the rat, you will get a birthday cake :)
[4:22:11] <+patel347> can you imagine if reggie didnt kill the channelor
[4:22:11] <+paladinstarbuster> he made all of the rules

[4:32:52] <+TheOlMitcheroo> It does work, but only in NG+
[4:32:55] <KellBeII> although from what i understand about it, the sheer amount of enemies that spawn might be too much for NG
[4:32:56] <seydaq> gravelord gives sparda tho
[4:32:59] <+TheFrancix> time for the vagoo dragon?

[4:34:32] <TheHeroAppears> it's part of the experience that's why we care
[4:34:34] <@Solidus_113> he gives armour and weapons
[4:34:35] <OblivionSword1> This is more important
[4:34:35] <jumpyhugs> Kirk is the Dark Souls Sonic cosplayer

[4:34:57] <+Reverend_Roscoe> is woolie doing these?
[4:34:57] <+patel347> you dont need to fight him 3 times
[4:34:59] <derap41> No we demand everyone plays the game the exact same way always
[4:35:00] <Monkeyweed21> If you dont fight Kirk every time you dont get his gear
[4:35:02] <rasamune> There's Nothing Here
[4:35:06] <+DeadStage> some people play and never see Kirk, it's not part of the experience
[4:35:06] <zepelinnn1> he will miss stuff, its fine
[4:35:07] <bevyrage> well you are guaranteed to not get 100% content, due to how some loot drops
[4:35:10] <Shwepie> You'll get Reggie% content and you'll like it.
[4:35:16] <bobxmaker> i'm sure reggie is gonna play dark souls again just to experience everything on his own free time

[4:43:24] <greatspaceadventure> this is one of the most level-appropriate bosses in the game in terms of difficulty
[4:43:29] <justcallmebobplease> His body isn't even a hitbox for soaking damage - just his tail, butt, limbs, and gape.
[4:43:37] <KeiganOfAstora> Summoning people gives the boss more HP
[4:43:40] <greatspaceadventure> truly, he is passing the torch @Peterbyte_
[4:43:42] <gryffinp> Thing is, reggie spent a lot of time swinging at the tail, which he now has no need to do in the future

[4:47:35] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus The tail resets. It doesn't stay cut.
[4:47:36] <+Shishi1205> it doesnt from what I remember
[4:47:37] <%Indigo_Automaton> Reggie's got shorties in Vinheim, Astora, and Catarina
[4:47:46] <+HelloImTom08> that poor rat was innocent reggie
[4:47:47] <bevyrage> what about new londo?
[4:47:48] <Raldavar> It can be buffed though which also boost the weapon art
[4:47:49] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus But the only point to cutting it a second time is to disable the tail swing attack.
[4:47:52] <+patriotrenegade> Gravelord sign

[4:50:56] <penitentpendant> If the Gaping Dragon becomes Reggie's "Wall", I'll be confused
[4:51:01] <+Shishi1205> Running gets you killed
[4:51:03] <pi_in_the_sci> Elden ring looked like it might have made weapon blocking more viable
[4:51:05] <+patriotrenegade> Reggie got this
[4:51:09] <%A_German_spy> @patriotrenegade I'd link you the interview, but I think links aren't permitted
[4:51:14] <oneimportantthing> Reggie will beat him this time and I WILL DIE ON THIS HILL
[4:51:17] <$eco419> Going all in
[4:51:29] <royb2> 10 000 points in the game you can do it reggie

[4:53:02] <+Shishi1205> @gryffinp he did in the parish
[4:53:03] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Not to mention buffing the boss
[4:53:03] <+Amaideus> He'd also buff the dragon
[4:53:04] <DSD24> Channeler and his Six Eyeballs
[4:53:07] <lotharrio> Live by the rat, die by the rat.
[4:53:09] <+cdrom321> And he would buff the boss atk and def.
[4:53:13] <%Deekman> you've got 1 soft humanity now
[4:53:14] <bevyrage> the channeler also does the attack buff if you let the dragon get too close to the wall
[4:53:15] <fistynopunches> im not a believer anymore
[4:53:17] <Darren716> @WoolieVersus Yo the gold pine rein too
[4:53:20] <penitentpendant> @DSD24 And 3 pairs of sunglasses!

[4:53:25] <%Solidnick18> you can try
[4:53:27] <DianaTheAscian> I always wondered if that is intended
[4:53:29] <+Amaideus> This fight can be turbo fucked, huge HP boss, can be buffed, AND you can fight it while you're cursed
[4:53:31] <+patriotrenegade> taaaake meeeeee onnnnnn
[4:53:35] <%BisoromiBear> he's got this

[4:56:49] <Knight_Anastasia> Suggestion, Reggie Vs Code vein after DS?
[4:56:52] <penitentpendant> Da Kick
[4:56:56] <KeiganOfAstora> need stronger weapon
[4:56:56] <Dopamien> calebKek
[4:56:57] <AvroEltz> reggie is too scurred to attack the head
[4:56:58] <+TheFrancix> RIDER KICK
[4:56:58] <+robertoszek> the head is a weak point, right? I wonder if Reggie will muster the courage to attack it
[4:57:03] <PrideOfFiddles> Kick for BM
[4:57:04] <emptyantics> Two hand the weapon no need to have shield on such a giant monster
[4:57:04] <VJdarkworld> sparta kick for good measure
[4:57:07] <subjectg> what do you get for tail-cutting gaping dragon again?
[4:57:07] <RickyRelucent> Head IS  aweakpoint
[4:57:09] <Raldavar> Code vein is very janky
[4:57:11] <RickyRelucent> but GL getting it ever
[4:57:17] <%trigunstar26> why is he even bothering with the shield for this fight?
[4:57:20] <%hiswill98> I feel like this boss would be so much better if it dealt just 25% less damage
[4:57:22] <jumpyhugs> strange, no barfies yet
[4:57:22] <RickyRelucent> the only time its within reach is after the huge crash he does
[4:57:25] <RickyRelucent> before the charge
[4:57:30] <oda_flobunaga> Hakuna Dentata
[4:57:30] <TheHeroAppears> he love jumpin
[4:57:32] <RickyRelucent> after which he leans up again
[4:57:32] <+patriotrenegade> Goddamn this OST is fire

[4:58:15] <subjectg> @penitentpendant crasheem WTF!
[4:58:15] <+HeroSolaire> @Amaideus probably not at all considering he didnt go back with the ember
[4:58:20] <oneimportantthing> I died on this hill :(
[4:58:25] <RickyRelucent> what lvl is reggingworth
[4:58:28] <tenshi_q> I still believe Copium
[4:58:28] <MrMatternot> 2 Hand and Gold Pine Resin will help
[4:58:34] <RickyRelucent> cant decide wether he should verse gaing again
[4:58:35] <+Rasheedt> @amaideus +4 I think
[4:58:39] <RickyRelucent> gapîng*
[4:58:41] <scrambledxeggz> maybe two hand since the shield isnt so good right now?
[4:58:43] <mar_krow> try not to lock on
[4:58:45] <penitentpendant> That's not the fetish we encourage around here~
[4:58:48] <KeiganOfAstora> smaller weapon would be about to hit more times quicker
[4:58:54] <AvroEltz> I lost 70k on capra, from the 7k left i already got 21k, lifes good
[4:58:56] <RickyRelucent> Not locking on is a BIG helppp here
[4:58:59] <%Mathochism> luckybunOwo
[4:59:07] <RickyRelucent> try and aim for his legs
[4:59:07] <+HeroSolaire> The game opens up shortcut so you can level up your weapon with ember
[4:59:09] <peachy996> Isn't it just awful knowing what the phrase "vore" means?
[4:59:12] <RickyRelucent> think theyy are weak too
[4:59:12] <peachy996> Terrible stuff
[4:59:20] <BurdRightsActivist> Believers?
[4:59:23] <KeiganOfAstora> vordt'd
[4:59:24] <+swesterly> Fuck I love gambling

[4:59:33] <DSD24> Too big to be called a Axe
[4:59:36] <seydaq> putting the salty in salty bet NotLikeThis
[4:59:37] <%mr_sups> It was too big to be called an AXE
[4:59:39] <glass_marcus> Gambling is the best thing to happen to twitch
[4:59:47] <@Solidus_113> I got 417k points, but I can't bet and also choose the outcome
[4:59:48] <tenshi_q> there's no way he's killing it now
[4:59:50] <TheHeroAppears> lets go woolie :^)
[4:59:55] <BurdRightsActivist> DRAKE SWORD LUL
[4:59:55] <MeImoth> I love the greataxe, its super slow and no range but it hit like a dumptruck
[4:59:57] <oneimportantthing> HODL! Reggie to the moooon
[5:00:04] <+patriotrenegade> lol my Muscle Wizard uses a Crystal Greataxe
[5:00:05] <KeiganOfAstora> long sword can do more damage with more hits
[5:00:08] <+HeroSolaire> Woolie forgot to remind him about the ember
[5:00:10] <AvroEltz> I'll just consider betting on yes when he summons best boy lautrec
[5:00:12] <%trigunstar26> Oh he got the Drake Sword!
[5:00:15] <subjectg> @solidus_113 woolie or another mod can call it if you can’t

[5:04:46] <royb2> midroll best roll
[5:04:55] <+Amaideus> He might be accidentally jumping while trying to roll if he hasn't swapped the control to L3
[5:05:01] <Monkeyweed21> @RickyRelucent he's a new player he needs as much defense as he can get
[5:05:03] <subjectg> that sprint into jump stuff is exactly why i use l3 jump

[5:09:13] <emptyantics> DONT GIVE UP SKELETON
[5:09:14] <+Awkward_Cyborg> time to repair everything
[5:09:14] <@Solidus_113> good job drake sword
[5:09:15] <%mr_sups> I want you to know Reggie. We mostly bet against you. We did not have faith in you.
[5:09:16] <+RemedyofRevenge> mans got like 2 feet away from the edge
[5:09:21] <+patriotrenegade> That was luck
[5:09:21] <Teras_ode> Thank you sword SeemsGood
[5:09:21] <+megaman_sentinel> yea we going 2 Blight-Con
[5:09:22] <+Shishi1205> yeah
[5:09:22] <Deko_> LUL
[5:09:24] <SkreamnRedSkull> I've totally fell off it on one of my first tries
[5:09:25] <AbnormalVoid> RIP Thorn Armor
[5:09:25] <+xyxlzyzm> he was INCHES from falling
[5:09:27] <penitentpendant> @DeadStage Dragon took the dive for the payout
[5:09:35] <Slim_Lipid> you can still fall off too
[5:09:35] <pi_in_the_sci> within 5 feet once
[5:09:43] <brisk_dacat> woolieCHAN top play
[5:09:44] <%Deekman> "thank you sword"
[5:09:44] <RickyRelucent> was kinda sure he'd roll off the cliff or get punted off tbh
[5:09:45] <gryffinp> drake sword is indeed op
[5:09:45] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @mr_sups I bet for him once I knew he had the knowledge. And the Drake Sword.
[5:09:49] <StarlitStunner> Big money for honey
[5:09:49] <seydaq> imagine if that was crystal gear
[5:09:50] <jumpyhugs> also pretty sure dragons are magic resistant
[5:09:52] <VJdarkworld> drake's usefulness soon to fall off tho...
[5:09:52] <+Awkward_Cyborg> rip kirk, no more thorn armor during this playthrough
[5:09:54] <RickyRelucent> glad to see i was horrifically wrong
[5:09:55] <+patriotrenegade> Good job sword!
[5:09:58] <Monkeyweed21> @AbnormalVoid it was guaranteed that he would miss kirk at least once on a new playthrough
[5:10:03] <+Shishi1205> faster swings tho
[5:10:12] <+blink289> yeah much higher dps
[5:10:13] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh no blighttown
[5:10:14] <subjectg> kirk is really easy to miss honestly
[5:10:20] <+37calorieghost> new to the manga, how long did Reggie spend on ol' Capra?
[5:10:22] <RickyRelucent> @Awkward_Cyborg ehh, he'd have to be alive at 3 different spots

[5:10:30] <+Shishi1205> @37calorieghost 2 tries
[5:10:33] <RickyRelucent> thorns armor loss was inevitable
[5:10:33] <AvroEltz> Fuck, i lost even more money
[5:10:35] <Monkeyweed21> ITS EVEN WORSE THAN THIS SHITHOLE
[5:10:37] <@Solidus_113> the door to Laval
[5:10:38] <+terry_quest> is blighttown fixed in the remaster?
[5:10:39] <+DeadStage> I hope Reggie sticks to the claymore instead of Drake Sword though. I want him to get that STRENGTH
[5:10:39] <+37calorieghost> niiiice
[5:10:40] <Slim_Lipid> this is why you prioritise damage and just learn the fight
[5:10:42] <DSD24> Keep Blighttown Weird!
[5:10:43] <penitentpendant> This... IS THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE TRACKS
[5:10:44] <Deko_> it gets even worse

[5:12:27] <RickyRelucent> @penitentpendant wouldn't be too far, andre and then the grass cres knight
[5:12:28] <derap41> George RR Martin Seething in rage right now
[5:12:28] <+Shady_Zaku> This landscape of grey water and grey treeees
[5:12:31] <DSD24> Dragons San Frontiers
[5:12:34] <+RemedyofRevenge> its a dragon breath-nostate @WoolieVersus
[5:12:35] <+Shishi1205> and the white dragon fucked it up
[5:12:35] <%Deekman> we even got thjs crystal shit to make us double immortal
[5:12:40] <RickyRelucent> definately doable after goyles
[5:12:41] <lotharrio> Trees, dragons, and gray water.
[5:12:46] <+Shady_Zaku> Don't, even, NNNEED IT
[5:12:47] <Teras_ode> drakes are to dragons what birds are to dinosaurs
[5:12:50] <jumpyhugs> If it has no arms to rake, then it surely is a drake
[5:12:51] <+Awkward_Cyborg> you can read the dragon's soul
[5:12:56] <+patel347> they are like demi gods
[5:13:00] <SethYuikora> Aint. Even. Got. Legs.
[5:13:14] <MinersLoveGames> Essentially god-like creatures.
[5:13:17] <RickyRelucent> hows it feel, Gape?
[5:13:17] <+patel347> read the soul
[5:13:17] <derap41> He's been eating shit all his life
[5:13:23] <RickyRelucent> To be a  B I T C H
[5:13:24] <+Amaideus> They're morphic creatures
[5:13:28] <DSD24> Always hungry!
[5:13:30] <+Amaideus> Though most things in Souls are
[5:13:31] <emptyantics> “Howsit feel to be a B I T C H”
[5:13:31] <lotharrio> It's like Digimon
[5:13:32] <derap41> He ate all the poop
[5:13:36] <wqorst> turned into a vore elemental
[5:13:37] <@Solidus_113> not quite immortal, but they don't age iirc
[5:13:37] <+Shady_Zaku> How's it ffeeeel Seath? To be a mmmBITCHHHH?
[5:13:39] <churropoppa> They're philosophical concepts along with being living beings.
[5:13:41] <%gatorafan> Hungry Hungry Hippos
[5:13:45] <Monkeyweed21> A dragon ate so much garbage and shit that it became flesh and blood
[5:13:47] <seydaq> congrats you gained mortality
[5:13:47] <RickyRelucent> LLLLLlllllightning!
[5:13:51] <jumpyhugs> grab a snickers
[5:13:54] <SethYuikora> You're not you when you're hungry
[5:13:56] <+Shishi1205> @Solidus_113 like elf inmortality
[5:13:56] <%Irridium> HORNGRY
[5:13:57] <+slidshockingkrow> the arch-dragons were immortal becuase they weren't truly alive. Now they can die because fire brought disparity
[5:14:02] <rasamune> It became Hunger
[5:14:05] <MinersLoveGames> While most of the dragons were killed, a handful managed to survive in the corners of the world.
[5:14:06] <Deko_> 25k tho
[5:14:10] <peachy996> When you become the munchies
[5:14:10] <+Shady_Zaku> I got a MIASMA UO MA AAASSHOOO
[5:14:11] <+RemedyofRevenge> @WoolieVersus its also why they had stoney scales, as they matched the environment in the war before the age of fire, before the Witches of Izalith burned the archtrees away
[5:14:18] <Deewtssob> FeEd Me SeYmouR
[5:14:20] <gryffinp> homeward bones are the best
[5:14:20] <+patel347> read the soul

[5:14:42] <+Awkward_Cyborg> remember to repair
[5:14:45] <penitentpendant> @RemedyofRevenge You'd think they'd have bark scales then
[5:14:46] <%Deekman> @WoolieVersus did you read the soul?
[5:14:48] <+patel347> nope
[5:14:49] <+37calorieghost> @solidus_113 iirc functional immortality, they could die, but they don't age and the only way to kill them was to get around their impenetrable scales, hence plauges, lightning bolts, and seath's treachery
[5:14:49] <+patel347> im wrong
[5:14:50] <+patel347> no soul

[5:15:05] <%livlinn> woolieLORE grymTerry
[5:15:05] <pixel_river> i forgot how incredible this game is
[5:15:07] <+Amaideus> That's BKS levels out souls
[5:15:16] <Dopamien> played ds1 after ds3 so I instinctivly went to firelink everytime to lvl up
[5:15:18] <Treasure_Vault> How much did int help you during that fight, Reggie?
[5:15:26] <Treasure_Vault> Or did swinging do all your damage?
[5:15:29] <RickyRelucent> @Treasure_Vault
[5:15:33] <emptyantics> Bruh I can get 2 Jack in the Box tacos with all those souls
[5:15:35] <+patriotrenegade> Man he really wants that soell
[5:15:46] <RickyRelucent> reggie
[5:15:51] <RickyRelucent> there is lightning and fire resin
[5:15:53] <%livlinn> Roll?
[5:15:55] <%Lion_kun> This is the weirdest built
[5:15:56] <derap41> Woolie stop minmaxing
[5:15:57] <%Indigo_Automaton> Reggie pls
[5:16:04] <%Bread_Assassin> Shh Woolie
[5:16:05] <%livlinn> woolieMINHMAX woolieMINHMAX woolieMINHMAX
[5:16:06] <+DeadStage> pump STRONG
[5:16:07] <subjectg> Level resistance, it’s the only way
[5:16:09] <%Lion_kun> His quality build is morphing into a spell build
[5:16:16] <sendart> 16 is a good break point
[5:16:18] <%Lion_kun> What a waste of a BKS
[5:16:27] <RickyRelucent> Man, reggie will have no endurance or vit if he picks int
[5:16:28] <%Solidnick18> but big strong
[5:16:30] <RickyRelucent> feelsbadman
[5:16:32] <emptyantics> STR CHADS WYA?!
[5:16:35] <derap41> @Lion_kun BKS is too easy
[5:16:36] <RickyRelucent> fashion souls go DOWN
[5:16:44] <buerdo> @woolieversus let reggie spread his stats, optimizing only really matters for ng+’s or pvp
[5:16:49] <+DeadStage> ye ye ye
[5:16:50] <Treasure_Vault> Reminder: Levels get expensive real quick
[5:16:55] <baijieli> 18
[5:16:55] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @emptyantics apes together strong
[5:17:02] <derap41> its 16
[5:17:03] <slippery_arms> oh no hes gonna be super sqishy this whole lp i already see it
[5:17:04] <aeravon> let him play the game folks. he can do what he wants
[5:17:05] <+TheOlMitcheroo> @Lion_kun Just because he got a lucky drop doesn't mean he needs to use it
[5:17:08] <pi_in_the_sci> 14 is enough for all strength weapons
[5:17:09] <+Shishi1205> 16 I would say
[5:17:10] <pixel_river> on my fisrt playthrough when the game came out or just picked all over the place lol
[5:17:10] <SethYuikora> 16-18 will be good for almost everything
[5:17:14] <MeImoth> 18 or 20 DEX
[5:17:15] <+heros_lucatero> atpGasm
[5:17:19] <%Grimlockfly> Reggie is never going to use magic, but he's going to dump everything into intelligence
[5:17:29] <MeImoth> 20 Dex will unlock almost everything
[5:17:29] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[5:17:29] <AvroEltz> Put DEX in 40, just to be sure
[5:17:32] <+Jiggisnipe> typically you build towards a weapon or whatever
[5:17:33] <glass_marcus> get attunement to 4 slots
[5:17:39] <sendart> dex also make spell go fast
[5:17:41] <lotharrio> Big brain move, tbh. Haha2020
[5:17:41] <mar_krow> 40 dex pyro
[5:17:42] <+Aikao> he just doesn't want to be dumb PepeHands
[5:17:54] <RickyRelucent> he should be getting endurence or str+dex /cry
[5:18:02] <%Grimlockfly> comparitively, pyro costs nothing and you're using it all the time
[5:18:03] <%Bread_Assassin> Just pump Int. You can infuse to make weapons scale with it.
[5:18:03] <@Solidus_113> at least at this point he'll be about to talk to logan
[5:18:04] <RickyRelucent> damnit regdeworth
[5:18:07] <tenshi_q> why isn't reggie doing the build I want??
[5:18:07] <royb2> @Grimlockfly Well he can go the magic path for weapon modification so its not completely wasted
[5:18:15] <gryffinp> everything to 40, except faith. take faith's points and raise resistance to 80
[5:18:16] <%Grimlockfly> @royb2 i spose
[5:18:18] <DianaTheAscian> What is Reggie building towards?
[5:18:23] <LunarRemix> Everything
[5:18:24] <Johannen> ..."keep on pumping strengh" he aint getting it
[5:18:27] <%Solidnick18> no clue
[5:18:28] <Dabrikishaw> What kind of build is Reggie going for?
[5:18:29] <+xyxlzyzm> whatever upsets chat the most, apparently
[5:18:31] <RickyRelucent> @DianaTheAscian Not a clue he hasn't said
[5:18:32] <lotharrio> What he feels like, DianaTHeAscian.
[5:18:34] <%cobalt_phoenix_> he has a long ways to go, two more into int to use the spell won't mean he can't do str weapon stuff
[5:18:36] <+Jiggisnipe> nothing he's just having fun
[5:18:37] <emptyantics> Jusy raise STR to 99
[5:18:40] <RickyRelucent> seems to lean thoward quality with int suppplements
[5:18:42] <DianaTheAscian> oh no
[5:18:44] <penitentpendant> @DianaTheAscian Everything but Faith and Res
[5:18:46] <Treasure_Vault> Reggie is aiming for the big big big big, obviously
[5:18:49] <Darren716> You just got a soul
[5:18:54] <+37calorieghost> the chat screamed in fear, for the streamers would not hear them
[5:18:55] <Treasure_Vault> Wrong?
[5:18:57] <%Irridium> didn
[5:18:59] <+Jack8274> WHAT>
[5:19:02] <mar_krow> lol
[5:19:02] <+Awkward_Cyborg> you got the dragon's soul
[5:19:03] <jumpyhugs> no butterfly yet?
[5:19:03] <%Irridium> didn't the gaping dragon drop a soul?
[5:19:04] <+Amaideus> Well
[5:19:04] <+Jiggisnipe> ?
[5:19:05] <Darren716> CHECK
[5:19:06] <derap41> Its a poop eating dragon
[5:19:07] <+Amaideus> It's lore reasons

[5:20:04] <Teras_ode> minmaxing doesn't matter until ng+, the only way you can fuck up your build to unplayable in ds1 is if you somehow waste levels on resistance or attunement or disregard your primary attack stats, mixing magic and phys attack isn't as detrimental as min-maxer brains would lead you to think

[5:22:31] <+xyxlzyzm> @TheOlMitcheroo no it was kirk that people lost their shit about
[5:22:33] <MeImoth> I mean... comparing this to what I have seen from chat in other DS streams, this is pretty mild backseating tbh
[5:22:34] <CrazyMedicine> @TheOlMitcheroo LMAO
[5:22:34] <Hydrapissed> yep works in story to dragons dont got souls Clap
[5:22:36] <+Jiggisnipe> they're all chump bosses
[5:22:36] <RickyRelucent> who the fuck ,saves solaire at playtrough one
[5:22:36] <%Orcapugs> Titanite Slab 10 plus to chat
[5:22:37] <+DeadStage> In a way the boss soul was the tail, gave you a weapon based on the boss
[5:22:37] <+37calorieghost> I don't get why people want them to hit everything, I love for first playthroughs where they miss everything
[5:22:40] <+Amaideus> There's lore reasons for why none of these bosses drop souls
[5:22:41] <tenshi_q> but gaping dragon DOES drop a soul!!! Kappa
[5:22:42] <pixel_river> soul games backseating is always intense
[5:22:46] <brunoberserk> no he is not , kirk dont appear in the depths anymore if you  kill the boss , but he also invades in other areas
[5:22:47] <SethYuikora> And then DS2, EVERYTHING gives boss souls
[5:22:47] <+Amaideus> Note they DO drop humanity
[5:22:55] <+xyxlzyzm> @tenshi_q I BEEN SAYING
[5:22:55] <RickyRelucent> hype
[5:22:57] <penitentpendant> Grats to the people who won out on the boss gamblin'~
[5:22:58] <AvroEltz> Cant believe Woolie killed Queequeg earlier
[5:23:01] <Hydrapissed> it gets pretty bad lol
[5:23:03] <+Rafraud> It gets p bad
[5:23:06] <DianaTheAscian> it can get pretty bad
[5:23:09] <emptyantics> DS2 even the regular enemies drop souls
[5:23:09] <+Shishi1205> you do nothing
[5:23:10] <%Josef_Stryker> It gets *rough*
[5:23:13] <+Amaideus> It's bad for PVP
[5:23:13] <%Solidnick18> one must consult the pat!
[5:23:14] <BlackermanZX> hooo boy
[5:23:15] <Explodincatz> 100 ways to play but only 10 are viable
[5:23:16] <%BisoromiBear> just make up for a bad build with good execution
[5:23:16] <Blank9> flat character  is  great  if you do  certain weaponnns
[5:23:19] <+Amaideus> But it doesn't matter that much
[5:23:21] <seydaq> its not that bad
[5:23:22] <+Jiggisnipe> I bet it's overblown
[5:23:24] <sendart> as long as you aren't dumping points into resistance  your good
[5:23:25] <lotharrio> It won't be that bad if you can grind via being summoned.
[5:23:28] <%Lion_kun> Just grind to smooth out the edges.
[5:23:28] <+Amaideus> Unless you go SUPER wide
[5:23:29] <%livlinn> dechartThumbsUp dechartThumbsUp dechartThumbsUp
[5:23:30] <Monkeyweed21> quality is good but you have to actually decide on it
[5:23:31] <+Rafraud> It becomes jack of all trades master of none, and your damage flat lines
[5:23:32] <SethYuikora> grinding is still a viable option
[5:23:33] <%cobalt_phoenix_> he'll be fine
[5:23:33] <Hydrapissed> its pretty bad dont listen to the people who say its not lol
[5:23:35] <Johannen> Not enough damage or hp is the main thing
[5:23:35] <+Jiggisnipe> you can beat the game
[5:23:37] <%Grimlockfly> you're getting there
[5:23:37] <RickyRelucent> You cant fuck up
[5:23:38] <%andrewofbob> Lots of little damage from many sources?
[5:23:41] <mar_krow> u cant really go wrong with pyro
[5:23:42] <JetpackMcQuack> you have damage
[5:23:42] <RickyRelucent> u can do four kings at sl1
[5:23:44] <tenshi_q> you can just grind anyways though
[5:23:45] <Monkeyweed21> level 20ish is still fine
[5:23:46] <AbnormalVoid> if you want just general utility sorcery, 14 is a good place to stop
[5:23:46] <RickyRelucent> if so inclined
[5:23:48] <@Solidus_113> you have to remember that each level costs more
[5:23:49] <Treasure_Vault> It depends on if you wanna farm?
[5:23:49] <+Shishi1205> Just leave faith behind please
[5:23:50] <+xyxlzyzm> just uuhhhhh build for that one sword that the one guy in the dlc drops
[5:23:50] <+Aikao> Time to farm souls LUL
[5:23:50] <+RemedyofRevenge> @WoolieVersus there are weapon upgrade paths you can take to make a flat build into a quality build.
[5:23:51] <+xyxlzyzm> lel
[5:23:52] <MeImoth> you can salvage a flat character, but you need specific thing to be GOOD at something in that case
[5:23:55] <DianaTheAscian> Flat characters can do a bunch of mediocre stuff
[5:23:55] <+TheOlMitcheroo> You can beat the game with SL1 build, you can never softlock yourself
[5:23:56] <%SveriSageAdvice> you can absolutely fuck it up, but Reggie hasnt gone far enough in to make it hurt
[5:23:56] <pixel_river> i completed the game without doing stats with meaning
[5:23:57] <linSP> don’t do any faith
[5:23:58] <lotharrio> People beat this game at level 1
[5:24:00] <brunoberserk> imagine the horror of a build with 40 resistance WutFace
[5:24:06] <peachy996> This is way simpler in Bloodborne.
[5:24:08] <%Lion_kun> I've done a faith/hybrid build in DES where I spread my points between 4 stats and it worked pretty well.
[5:24:09] <pixel_river> i just did stuff
[5:24:09] <+pectusumbra> The worst case is your damage becomes limp, but you can become a pyromaniac in the end I suppose
[5:24:13] <BigYanno> he's still really low level. he can pivot to most things wothout too much trouble
[5:24:15] <peachy996> Despite what Pat initially though
[5:24:18] <justcallmebobplease> You can beat the game at Soul Level 1, so all this 'oooooh the build oh no!' is nonsense IMO
[5:24:23] <RickyRelucent> Also, pyro starts with lower int
[5:24:24] <+sewermonk> str/int build should be fine
[5:24:26] <subjectg> If you do horribly screw up, there’s always the hex editor!
[5:24:33] <RickyRelucent> so he'll be higher lvl then characters who starrt with bigger int
[5:24:33] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[5:24:36] <%Lion_kun> Generally I like to keep my points to 3 stats.
[5:24:37] <RickyRelucent> for the same int
[5:24:38] <marcomatame> Dark Souls is a numbers game, the only things that matter is the ability to deal and negate damaga
[5:24:39] <DuckfishPrime> Lightning and fire/chaos are also good safeguards against that too.
[5:24:42] <+Jiggisnipe> it just becomes hard but Reggie likes a challenge
[5:24:43] <+Jiggisnipe> yea
[5:24:49] <NicholasOsen_> You can beat it with any build, but it will be harder when your damage doesn't scale as well
[5:24:52] <RickyRelucent> but thats only if u wanna keep friends withijn 13 lvls
[5:24:52] <+37calorieghost> did we not pick pyro for the sole purpose of it being the most flexible and easy to redirect starting class?
[5:24:54] <Shwepie> @justcallmebobplease That's largely thanks to Pyromancy scaling without increasing your level.
[5:24:54] <RickyRelucent> or wanna pvp
[5:24:59] <UnlimitedBick> GRIND STREAM GRIND STREAM
[5:25:02] <AvroEltz> GUYS, we know you can beat the game sl1, but this IS A LP, and reggie is playing for the first time, ffs think about it
[5:25:02] <RickyRelucent> that u should think about that
[5:25:05] <+ReallyBigRocks> sitma grindset
[5:25:06] <Hydrapissed> reggie wants to be the SWIS army knife
[5:25:06] <mrblack499> grind town here we go
[5:25:06] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus main thing to keep in mind is that levels are super cheap right now, so staying spread when those levels start costing like 15k each it becomes an issue
[5:25:08] <+Shishi1205> @37calorieghost picked it for the fire actually
[5:25:09] <@Solidus_113> but yeah you can always grind
[5:25:13] <lotharrio> "So we played a little, off stream."
[5:25:18] <sendart> there are some good grind spots
[5:25:21] <DXLelouch24> Theres a respec mod
[5:25:21] <%Lion_kun> DS2, you have to waste a lot of levels to get adaptabiltiy up to snuff.
[5:25:22] <pixel_river> putting ex in specific places is not that important for completion
[5:25:25] <MeImoth> also, fire and lightning weapons give you damage when you stats give you none
[5:25:26] <+37calorieghost> @shishi1205 also valid, point still stands tho
[5:25:27] <RickyRelucent> multiple playtroughs!
[5:25:28] <DianaTheAscian> The average final level for this game is way lower than the others  as well
[5:25:29] <RickyRelucent> WOOH
[5:25:31] <+Amaideus> DS2 throws way more souls at you than DS1 does
[5:25:38] <cooldude69xx> @AvroEltz "No, play i tour way"
[5:25:41] <%Seancicle> 👉🏻👂🏻
[5:25:44] <+Shishi1205> Reggie chose that but yeah it comes with perks
[5:25:44] <+DeadStage> I did a SL1 run once, you'll be fine
[5:25:44] <JetpackMcQuack> no specialties
[5:25:48] <+RyTYoung> That's a nice uchi
[5:25:57] <+xyxlzyzm> magic uchi is a build you can do too tbh
[5:25:57] <%Solidnick18> yup
[5:25:58] <sendart> enchanted uchi tho
[5:26:01] <+patel347> you can make the uchi magical
[5:26:03] <RickyRelucent> u can do tha
[5:26:04] <Blank9> magic rules
[5:26:05] <RickyRelucent> pyro is free
[5:26:08] <RickyRelucent> only costs souls
[5:26:09] <@Solidus_113> that's 3 builds
[5:26:13] <penitentpendant> TBF, pyro is available to all builds
[5:26:13] <+pectusumbra> are there boss weapons that scale on int?
[5:26:13] <seydaq> art build still an option
[5:26:15] <RickyRelucent> thing is, u have high dex now
[5:26:16] <%Solidnick18> but can't do all o it
[5:26:16] <+Shishi1205> yeah pyro is free but its juggling
[5:26:18] <+patel347> any build can use pyro
[5:26:19] <okramv> too many slots
[5:26:19] <RickyRelucent> and ur starting to lvl int
[5:26:20] <Monkeyweed21> Pyro quality is a very good build for new players @WoolieVersus
[5:26:21] <%Solidnick18> of*
[5:26:24] <MeImoth> maybe half a thing to much
[5:26:24] <+xyxlzyzm> @pectusumbra yes. butterfly horn
[5:26:26] <%gatorafan> it's one too many thing IMO
[5:26:26] <RickyRelucent> and u had good str
[5:26:28] <lotharrio> Not enough hands, really.
[5:26:30] <Teras_ode> you can actually do dex + magic easily, it isn't even a bad build
[5:26:30] <mar_krow> pyro is free so magic str or dex
[5:26:32] <RickyRelucent> so ur doing dex, str, pyro and int
[5:26:33] <Johannen> Pyro is free* but still needs Souls to get it there
[5:26:34] <%Grimlockfly> maybe a little too much for first playthrough.
[5:26:35] <RickyRelucent> that is indeed alot
[5:26:37] <linSP> pyro is kinda free sorta
[5:26:37] <emptyantics> What was the best spell in DS1?
[5:26:38] <subjectg> pyromancy is easy to spec into, it’s just hard to apply for a new player
[5:26:40] <+37calorieghost> you can totally magic+pyro
[5:26:49] <+xyxlzyzm> @emptyantics pursuers
[5:26:50] <RickyRelucent> iron flesh isnt gud anymore
[5:26:52] <%livlinn> PowerUpL woolieKICKDAD paleoHammer
[5:26:56] <RickyRelucent> used to be ezmode bosses with it
[5:27:01] <cooldude69xx> They do hit an interesting classic triangle of Fire, Electricity, and Ice
[5:27:01] <RickyRelucent> now u should want power within
[5:27:05] <MeImoth> Pyro+ weapon and support Sorcerys is doable, just don't overcommit into INT
[5:27:06] <JetpackMcQuack> that fireball can last all game
[5:27:08] <RickyRelucent> with buff spells, or just resin
[5:27:08] <+Amaideus> Power Within the sickest
[5:27:10] <seydaq> rip iron flesh
[5:27:13] <@Solidus_113> firestorm!
[5:27:13] <brunoberserk> the moonlight greatsword scales with magic right ?
[5:27:14] <Teras_ode> iron flesh was busted in the unpatched original
[5:27:19] <RickyRelucent> rip iron flesh indeed
[5:27:24] <mrshlonk> watching episode 2 rn to catch up
[5:27:26] <DianaTheAscian> @brunoberserk yeah
[5:27:27] <Dopamien> @brunoberserk int and str I think
[5:27:32] <RickyRelucent> also, they made it so power within no longer uses less HP AT UNUPGRADED
[5:27:47] <RickyRelucent> so no need to consider urself with killing urself at +15, cuz u kill urself just as hard
[5:27:49] <Teras_ode> can only walk but literally no damage from 'pancakeing' attacks
[5:27:52] <+TheOlMitcheroo> I think Reggie should build towards Moonlight Greatsword
[5:27:58] <JetpackMcQuack> Reggarth of all trades
[5:28:00] <+TheOlMitcheroo> STR/INT, he's there
[5:28:00] <seydaq> kaioken can fix any bad build spyCappa
[5:28:01] <%Grimlockfly> sword fireball combustion is real good combo
[5:28:15] <Monkeyweed21> @WoolieVersus the real commital point for int or faith is over 20, below that its just a minor investment to be able to use certain weapons

[5:30:19] <RickyRelucent> stalking the con like when he had the pred mask
[5:30:19] <%Solidnick18> Capra
[5:30:26] <+cdrom321> Woolie Boivin's discount medical service.
[5:30:30] <brunoberserk> oh god , remember that cursed image of woolie with pat's face ? WutFace
[5:30:45] <+Jiggisnipe> naw
[5:30:51] <AvroEltz> You had the right tools
[5:30:52] <SethYuikora> Clap a Capra
[5:30:54] <tenshi_q> blessed with skill
[5:30:54] <Hydrapissed> he summoned for gargyoles lol
[5:30:55] <%Solidnick18> it's for most newer players
[5:31:03] <%Seancicle> woolieTRASH
[5:31:04] <seydaq> no @brunoberserk  but now i know what to avoid
[5:31:05] <@Solidus_113> the camera doesn't help large fights
[5:31:16] <RickyRelucent> Clapra demon
[5:31:18] <Hydrapissed> People struggle with diff things to
[5:31:23] <JetpackMcQuack> Losing to gimmicks
[5:31:25] <AvroEltz> Its just hard to manage both of them at the same time
[5:31:26] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Yeah, that's kinda what I was wondering. With the big bosses, you tend to end up fighting the camera as much as the actual boss.
[5:31:35] <peachy996> Oh boy Paarl
[5:31:36] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1455421207659139081?t=Np244HCpRXfSBOkB2__Gpw&s=19
[5:31:39] <+Jiggisnipe> yea
[5:31:43] <%Lion_kun> The bosses in DES were a lot more puzzle-y
[5:31:46] <Monkeyweed21> Gaping is the end of the soft tutorial
[5:31:48] <%Prowtellen> summoning is a part of a game, therefore killing bosses on co-op is the way it was meant to be played
[5:31:54] <%Prowtellen> yes.
[5:31:59] <emptyantics> Can’t wait for Kellogs
[5:32:13] <JetpackMcQuack> even the one on one can be bad
[5:32:23] <%A_German_spy> Yeah, it sure does karacoLOL
[5:32:29] <Johannen> t..a..r..k..u...s
[5:32:33] <RickyRelucent> I'll have to be ontime for blight town, especially since he cant skip upper
[5:32:35] <RickyRelucent> funtimes!
[5:32:39] <Deko_> i wonder if next session is going to be 5 hours dying in blighttown
[5:32:40] <+Jiggisnipe> the weapon/build really affects that fight
[5:32:52] <AvroEltz> Also, getting staggered by the 2 dogs is not fun either
[5:32:56] <emptyantics> Can’t wait for Maddentown and Kellogs LUL
[5:32:57] <%Lion_kun> You had a great shield in the LP
[5:32:57] <+tempestzephyr> Luck is a skill
[5:32:59] <Monkeyweed21> Gaping is the litmus test of if you know the game well enough to do the rest of the game, everything after it gets real
[5:33:00] <Chatterbox1991> As Kool Mo Dee once said; Break out before you get Bumruched
[5:33:05] <DianaTheAscian> Was Wooile using [REDACTED] as his weapon of choice when he got to Kappra?
[5:33:07] <%A_German_spy> Yeah, that sounds about right karacoLOL
[5:33:08] <%Rafraud> FIGHT BACK
[5:33:11] <penitentpendant> Wakeup Super!
[5:33:12] <%sewermonk> sewermonk subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! Excited to see the playthrough go on! Would recommend the Daughters of Ash mod for later (sotfs style rearrange for ds1), lots of fun mindfucks and tricks goin on in there
[5:33:18] <JetpackMcQuack> don't even get to look LUL
[5:33:19] <a_mad_dragon_> this is why i always just bomb the capra from outside LUL
[5:33:38] <Pistofficer> 1st fight i had with Capra went with me dieing before the fog door even dissapated hahaha
[5:33:40] <+cdrom321> @emptyantics Kellogs pop-tart bitties.
[5:33:42] <RickyRelucent> it takes some doing to get ur build to be beyyond fucked
[5:33:44] <RickyRelucent> true
[5:33:44] <+Jiggisnipe> you can always beat the game, it just gets harder or easier depending on how you build
[5:33:50] <jett_eyes> Happened to me too. First time got lucky against capra, second time through it took me a good minute
[5:33:55] <+tempestzephyr> that doesn't sound fun for most people though
[5:33:58] <%BinaryFireball> grinding or learning movesets, spend your time how you want
[5:34:01] <%Grimlockfly> Cheer500 Reggie, what if Fireball Big?
[5:34:09] <%andrewofbob> Reminds me that Bloodstained's bosses needed a QA pass of the designer beating their boss flawlessly with the starter dagger
[5:34:10] <RickyRelucent> basically inpossible unless u go 41+ on stats
[5:34:16] <emptyantics> @sewermonk Mods kinda ruin the LP as it’s a new game for Reggie and he needs to experience it in it’s Vanilla state
[5:34:24] <+sweenicus> fireball big very important
[5:34:28] <RickyRelucent> or go 21+ on att
[5:34:34] <OhGeeWhy> the issue is your very first run. you kinda have no clue what you want
[5:34:38] <Hydrapissed> FIGHT FOR EVER fight forever
[5:34:38] <RickyRelucent> it takes 3 lvls for an att slot
[5:34:38] <@Solidus_113> DS3 is the game to use good magic in
[5:34:41] <RickyRelucent> at that point
[5:34:43] <%sewermonk> @emptyantics yeah, def a woolz recommend over reggie
[5:34:45] <+Jiggisnipe> doesn't sound fun
[5:34:49] <DeathByPoke7> still closed
[5:35:01] <JetpackMcQuack> but you could slide into a reggarth trap
[5:35:16] <seydaq> spyPraise spyPraise spyPraise
[5:35:39] <AvroEltz> Yeah, keeping your shield up when strafing, then 2 hand when going in
[5:35:40] <emptyantics> 2handed is so good
[5:35:42] <sendart> the depths does give you the tools to get a +10 weapon
[5:35:47] <SethYuikora> 2-handing, learn to roll
[5:35:50] <%mihokspawn> Best weapon for getting 2handed game is... ZWEI... but also any other :D
[5:35:50] <seydaq> 2 hand lets go
[5:35:53] <Blank9> 2handed halberd is great
[5:35:57] <%trigunstar26> Dark Souls 1 is the thinking man’s game
[5:35:58] <RickyRelucent> yeah did  reggie get the +10 upgrade meber
[5:36:01] <RickyRelucent> next to the butcher
[5:36:05] <RickyRelucent> someone? anyone?
[5:36:13] <%mihokspawn> @RickyRelucent yes
[5:36:16] <PrideOfFiddles> he did :)
[5:36:19] <%Solidnick18> that was something
[5:36:19] <seydaq> yup @rickyrelucent
[5:36:19] <+pectusumbra> without too much spoils, there's at least 2 boss weapons that can suit reggie well enough as a mage-hybrid
[5:36:19] <RickyRelucent> cool, pybro?
[5:36:24] <+Shishi1205> 2 hours? vs who
[5:36:31] <RickyRelucent> prolly right
[5:36:33] <RickyRelucent> mhm
[5:36:36] <PrideOfFiddles> yes
[5:36:42] <Sonny_Firestorm> game over yeah time?
[5:36:44] <+Jiggisnipe> was that Fume Knight?
[5:36:49] <RickyRelucent> hope he never says where he gets chaos pyro
[5:36:50] <DeathByPoke7> fume knight probably
[5:36:52] <RickyRelucent> ;-;
[5:36:54] <tenshi_q> oh right fume knight
[5:36:57] <RickyRelucent> to laurence
[5:36:58] <%sewermonk> yeah, its for a later playthrough
[5:37:04] <+Jiggisnipe> yea he meant later
[5:37:08] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Yeah that was Fume. AKA top three hardest souls bosses
[5:37:12] <+Shady_Zaku> baaad mojo lol yea later
[5:37:13] <DianaTheAscian> keyword later
[5:37:17] <jett_eyes> mods should only come after a first playthrough
[5:37:23] <+cdrom321> Dark Souls randomizer.
[5:37:24] <+Aikao> get those balls in the face
[5:37:27] <%CodenameChaz> Daughters of Ash is busted. Fucks with how armor and equip load works in teh worst ways
[5:37:29] <RickyRelucent> we'll get u some majestic destroyer shit reggie
[5:37:29] <tenshi_q> Fume knight wasn't that hard. right?
[5:37:30] <seydaq> orichinagi!
[5:37:31] <RickyRelucent> no worries
[5:37:32] <+Shishi1205> Is fume that hard? I beat him in my second try
[5:37:34] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[5:37:40] <+Smokpork> That whole DLC was good for boss fights, Fume and Alonne
[5:37:40] <+Jiggisnipe> Button Mashing LUL
[5:37:43] <tenshi_q> I always thought that was just a woolie thing
[5:37:54] <+Shishi1205> Manus, Orphan and other BB bosses are way harder
[5:38:02] <DianaTheAscian> @Shishi1205 depends on the player
[5:38:05] <+Shishi1205> Like Gael, sister friede etc
[5:38:19] <subjectg> @shishi1205 fume is hard if you’re dodging in rather than out
[5:38:20] <+Shishi1205> Yeah probably
[5:38:37] <+Jiggisnipe> but what if tho
[5:38:37] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I went through all the DS2 dlc on like NG+4 or 5, so Fume always destroyed me in one hit. Killed him with a pair of enchanted Old Whips
[5:38:37] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
