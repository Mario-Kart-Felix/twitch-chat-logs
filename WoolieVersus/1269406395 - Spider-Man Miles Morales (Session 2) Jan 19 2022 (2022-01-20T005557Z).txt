[0:00:10] <Aussie_Manny> Featuring Reggie.
[0:00:11] <leith_aziz> Hi
[0:00:24] <metabot64> so I forget thats like real trash thats woolie is in
[0:00:27] <%ZweihanderSteve> woolieGLORY
[0:00:28] <leith_aziz> Something happened? I wasnt there
[0:00:29] <%hereiam407> Yeh for sure
[0:00:31] <FrostedZaibatsu> hellos
[0:00:33] <+LazyAss24Seven> Sup boiz
[0:00:42] <Aussie_Manny> That was some good Quiet Mound 2 yesterday.
[0:00:44] <Arqartur0> I see Pat's beard was sacrificed, so that Reggie's beard would arise, like a Glorious Phoenix
[0:00:44] <%hereiam407> It went on reallllyyy long, because of the Xbox side story expansion
[0:00:47] <+zanz_san> SH2 made it all clear to be honest
[0:00:51] <slackerunchained> @WoolieVersus Don't worry, Woolz. Pat will *assuredly* be more than happy to fill you in on the lore. :P
[0:01:00] <Aussie_Manny> Silent Hill 3 is not bad.
[0:01:05] <%hereiam407> They fail hard, no originality, copy paste
[0:01:05] <%kyh9> Trying to replicate 1 or 2
[0:01:08] <leith_aziz> I was thinking of Konami, but ok
[0:01:10] <+jingokrieg> After 4 it all goes to shit, save shattered memories
[0:01:11] <%hereiam407> Silent Hill 3 is great
[0:01:14] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Awesomely Soul Crushing BibleThump
[0:01:18] <Zebroneath> No problem with the rush.  Letting it soak in away from the screen is good.
[0:01:20] <+zanz_san> SH3 is great though
[0:01:27] <%TreeeFOX> silent hill 3 is dope af
[0:01:27] <ProfessorBadvibes> I kinda feel that way about kingdom hearts since I got into it recently, after 2 it kinda goes downhill
[0:01:36] <%kyh9> But it's the inspiration
[0:01:40] <%hereiam407> @ProfessorBadvibes Yehhhh
[0:01:41] <ProfessorBadvibes> 3 is fun though
[0:01:45] <BlackermanZX> i personally liked SH Homecoming
[0:01:51] <leith_aziz> Im not really a horror fan, so I dont really know the right ingridient cohhNotes
[0:02:01] <+Sajallday> @ProfessorBadvibes I wouldn't say that, but I understand where you're coming from
[0:02:03] <@Menitta> FF had that too
[0:02:03] <%TreeeFOX> 1 is good, 2 is great, 3 is GOOD
[0:02:12] <%hereiam407> I love 3
[0:02:14] <+DatAsuna> Late in, what we talkin' about?
[0:02:24] <leith_aziz> For me its Yakuza 0 and Liek a Dragon

[0:02:39] <%hereiam407> Metal Gear is frozen in cryostasis for now
[0:02:43] <+mikesapartment> i dunno, the whole point of 2 is that it's almost a parody of 1
[0:02:45] <%SmylesonMyles> SmylesonMyles subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months, currently on a 4 month streak! Oh shit 11 months. Happy to have seen the growth in the channel with myself as well. One accomplishment being losing 65 pounds
[0:02:50] <%Shad0wTag> that game is hella celebrated now
[0:02:52] <%megaman_sentinel> he predicted the future
[0:02:54] <slackerunchained> This just in: Konami cares more about money than art. In other news, Water is wet.
[0:02:56] <%hereiam407> I'm replaying all of them, and MGS 1-4 still feels great
[0:02:56] <%livlinn> memes? joofbLurk
[0:02:56] <%ChoculaUltra> Kojima predicted the future almost too accurately monkaS
[0:02:57] <+Jiggisnipe> @DatAsuna franchises trying to replicate the success of their most popular game eg SH2 and the western followups
[0:02:57] <srv4254> snake eater man so good
[0:02:59] <Aussie_Manny> Metal Gear is dead, but I HOPE it's just in cryostasis.
[0:03:00] <MonadoAvocado> metal gear is as you would say; solid
[0:03:05] <leith_aziz> MGR doodOK
[0:03:27] <%hereiam407> Does anyone like Peace Walker?
[0:03:31] <%ChoculaUltra> let MGS die. Remakes/remasters fine - but adding anything to it after all these years after MG Survive would feel fake af.
[0:03:34] <%kyh9> ALMOST LIKE HAVING AN AUTEUR HELPS KEEP THE VISION STEADY
[0:03:36] <%TreeeFOX> until MGSV. never have I been more disappointed in a metal gear solid game.
[0:03:37] <Madinki> A lot of people like MGS 2 now because it predicted Twitter or something
[0:03:41] <leith_aziz> MGS4 is a game you could pick apart, but holy shit I probably love it pickyPog
[0:03:42] <+DatAsuna> @Jiggisnipe Ah makes sense
[0:03:44] <%kyh9> JUST LIKE HOW FINAL FANTASY LOST ITS MIND AFTER SAKAGUCHI LEFT
[0:04:01] <%kyh9> Let's have Gaming Auteur Theory 201
[0:04:04] <+DatAsuna> Yeah that's why I love Shattered Memories, and still appreciate 4, they tried weird new shit with silent hill
[0:04:06] <%Shad0wTag> @kyh9 At what game did he leave outta curiosity?
[0:04:22] <Aussie_Manny> Reggie be feelin' it.
[0:04:23] <Afrosamasenpai> hockey talk tho
[0:04:26] <%Shad0wTag> ! HOCKEY AT RISK !
[0:04:35] <%ChoculaUltra> the last game Sakaguchi was credited for, at least at Square was X-2
[0:04:38] <%ChoculaUltra> he left in 2003 iirc
[0:04:38] <%Prevot> Shattered Memories was the good way of trying to do a game over again
[0:04:41] <Aussie_Manny> BING BONG puck ya life! üèí
[0:05:04] <%hereiam407> A whole series about mentally disturbed people
[0:05:05] <%kyh9> @Shad0wTag He stopped working directly on the games after 9.  He left the company after XI, but he didn't really work on that or FFX

[0:22:02] <+Ricky_Rexx> At some point, you need to look at the superhero you're fighting and realize it's better to give up than lost all your walking privleges
[0:22:03] <%Shad0wTag> @choculaultra But did he steal some timbs upon getting outta jail
[0:22:28] <brachydios777> GRAVITY SQUEEZE
[0:22:39] <ignorum> imagine seeing your friends get catapulted like 10 meters by a single kick and thinking "I CAN TAKE HIM"

[0:26:04] <SmortyPuffin> GTA 4 did it in 2008
[0:26:07] <leith_aziz> Uncharted and GOW does this off the top of my mind
[0:26:14] <%Prevot> what even made it stop
[0:26:18] <%Lion_kun> "Now where were we" says Mimir
[0:26:25] <%RyTYoung> Guardians is pretty bad for having characters cut into each other‚Äôs sentences, there‚Äôs just so much dialogue
[0:26:31] <%Pillagius> Yeah... "ANyways were were we?" kind of thing sometimes can be hilarious, when the person on radio or whatnot you were talking to was panicking with something urgent
[0:26:32] <splinter1619> ye going through uncharted 4 rn it does do it

[0:27:45] <leith_aziz> pickyFight
[0:27:45] <+tigermask99> this LP bought you by JJJ Podcast
[0:27:50] <@Menitta> That's the double edged sword with so much dialogue. Guardians especially suffers from that because it's got such an impressive amount of dialogue
[0:28:14] <Arqartur0> what if we replaced the copyrighted music with Metal Gear Rising music?
[0:28:16] <+Ricky_Rexx> You could have just let him fall dude
[0:28:21] <slackerunchained> I DO have to say that people interrupting each other's sentences is a very 'realistic' trait, akin to normal speech.

[0:33:50] <@Menitta> Gah work internet is struggling
[0:33:53] <+toastybites> didnt pay the architect enough
[0:34:00] <ignorum> death star vibes
[0:34:10] <+Ricky_Rexx> Rogue one explains why that whole is in this building I believe
[0:34:46] <slackerunchained> I mean, sure, that guy is webbed-up, but can't he still *yell*?
[0:34:52] <HyperSonicX99> This look so clean in 60fps
[0:35:21] <+OddityOn> man... looking at this stealth again... I'm wondering how Gotham Knights is gonna play out
[0:35:27] <%mighty_max_t> I always do that too, that L1 prompt is unclear
[0:35:40] <%CateHecate> i feel like im totally insane for this but for some reason when this VA for miles talks it sometimes sounds like Baby Keem to me
[0:35:43] <metabot64> wow did they get miles spiderverse VA for this? sounds pretty similar
[0:35:43] <Aussie_Manny> Stealth suit!
[0:35:48] <+ReallyBigRocks> Spider-Man is STEALING electricity from working New Yorkers
[0:35:48] <taeko_ohnuki> this one is sick
[0:35:51] <%Shad0wTag> I love the STRIKE suit so sos much
[0:36:01] <%Pillagius> I hate how close the camera is during the vent sections... Juuuust a little bit further back would've been perfect
[0:36:06] <HyperSonicX99> Wear that Hood Spider-Man lmao
[0:36:07] <KeiganOfAstora> I like the winter suit with the scarf and hat
[0:36:13] <Dante_Namikaze1> the suit shit from the Ultimate Spider-Man cartoon
[0:36:14] <leith_aziz> @OddityOn I admit I was bummed out about that Batman Beyond game getting cancelled, even if Damien's a piece of s*it cohhSus
[0:36:22] <%Shad0wTag> Honestly think if Insomniac was brave they coulda had that be the main suit got the game
[0:36:24] <slackerunchained> Spider-Man punched that polar bear at the zoo! ...And tried to frame Frank Castle for it!
[0:36:24] <Arqartur0> I dunno, it looks off
[0:36:25] <TheeRabbi> Nah, he can't yell, because of the implication. If he were to yell, well, then Spiderman might have to put something in his mouth, to stop him. It's the implication. It keeps him quiet, cooperative.
[0:36:26] <Aussie_Manny> I recently watched the Ultimate Spider-Man episodes where Donald Glover voiced Miles. His performance was great.
[0:36:32] <%Prevot> I want a whole game that looks like that
[0:36:36] <metabot64> isn't there a 24fps spidersuit?
[0:36:39] <@Menitta> it looks fantastic when swinging
[0:36:48] <%kyh9> MILES KNOWS WHATS UP
[0:36:51] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @metabot64 that's the spiderverse suit woolie is going for
[0:36:52] <%mighty_max_t> Yeah, the Ultimate Spidey cartoon wasn't great, but it got Miles into the public eye, so good I guess?
[0:36:58] <%Shad0wTag> @metabot64 Yes

[0:38:19] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> How come you look so...animated
[0:38:23] <+warlockwithapixie> they are doing this FAST
[0:38:31] <Aussie_Manny> The suit is killing the cutscene. lol
[0:38:31] <%kyh9> If I become a super hero, I expect my crypto bro friend would become my villain
[0:38:35] <+warlockwithapixie> feels a little rushed
[0:38:35] <SmortyPuffin> Prowler had a face turn??
[0:38:47] <%Shad0wTag> This suit is absolutely out of place
[0:38:48] <taeko_ohnuki> Whack Prowler suit
[0:38:51] <+Jaromero435> blow people up
[0:38:52] <%Prevot> oh yeah it's rushed as hell
[0:38:55] <%townzzzzz> USE IT
[0:38:57] <%kyh9> The Spider-verse suit was so much better
[0:38:57] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Well game is much shorter
[0:38:57] <natedahate> hands him a gun
[0:39:00] <%RyTYoung> Yeyeye
[0:39:09] <%kyh9> Spider-verse prowler suit is much cooler
[0:39:09] <%livlinn> omg the toon shading LUL
[0:39:11] <Dante_Namikaze1> they assume you've watched the movie or read the comics
[0:39:13] <FassieFons> more of an anti-villain
[0:39:15] <Dio_TR> The MCU would make this the Prowler suit, over designed and messy to look at
[0:39:22] <%dds333a> @shad0wtag not more so than the rest of the game LUL
[0:39:27] <Aussie_Manny> This game assumes nothing.
[0:39:28] <%Shad0wTag> To be fair its fleshed out a lot later
[0:39:28] <%kyh9> @Dio_TR Tacticool is creatively bankrupt
[0:39:34] <leith_aziz> @warlockwithapixie That's kinda the issue with a short game like this. The pacing is FAST. It gets the job done, but it can feel like little breathing room. Oh well
[0:39:34] <slackerunchained> @kyh9 "Listen Spider-Man. I OWN the copyright for your brand now, since I created this NFT of you!"
[0:39:34] <%elderpunch> @Dio_TR spittin
[0:39:39] <%RyTYoung> I didn‚Äôt think my brain would disagree with seeing the animated suit in cutscenes, oh how wrong I was
[0:39:50] <HyperSonicX99> What if shocker came back in Sony‚Äôs Spider-Man 2 lmao?
[0:39:54] <+warlockwithapixie> He doesn't have the cape, very sad.
[0:39:56] <%mighty_max_t> Yeah, Prowler should have a cape, but capes are hard to do in games like this, and if you're not Batman, most people probably won't bother
[0:39:57] <Dante_Namikaze1> The Prowler's theme in this is so good
[0:40:06] <%MajorCrasher> these enemies LUL
[0:40:08] <%kyh9> @slackerunchained A villain who tries to NFT people's consciousnesses, but ends up just spending a lot of money on fancy receipts
[0:40:32] <metabot64> why does all evil eventually come back to NFTs?
[0:40:41] <leith_aziz> That is semi true. They spent a YEAR on Batman's cape
[0:40:42] <%Shad0wTag> @mighty_max_t I think the the no cape for the purpose of the game is ok
[0:40:45] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Did miss a session where Prowler was introduced?
[0:40:47] <Arqartur0> @kyh9 and his Lairs is called Cryptoisland... But it's not an island.
[0:40:48] <%KirbyAutomata> NFT MAN
[0:40:49] <slackerunchained> @kyh9 Actually, within the context of the Marvel universe, I could actually see NFT's having some legit metaphysical effect. :P

[0:48:25] <slackerunchained> @sonofthedeepsouth I support the notion of attributing ever-crazier abilities to spiders for coolness-factor... Akin to the Monarch with butterflies.

[1:13:44] <shadepman> you need to give miles the black air forces
[1:13:45] <%dds333a> @shad0wtag that's why you build it somewhere else before taking it yo the States, because we both know how this goes later
[1:13:48] <%elderpunch> @RyTYoung i was gifted
[1:14:04] <IvanMistwalker> @shadepman the Timbs make it better.

[1:15:50] <%Shad0wTag> @dds333a Well its a good thing that everything about nuform was rushed so as smart as it is to do it elsewhere the game has to do it here for game reasons
[1:15:53] <russiboy> it's a bionicle
[1:16:16] <%Shad0wTag> @leith_aziz Yeah news to me, I'm looking up on that shit man

[1:17:46] <%Shad0wTag> @dds333a Yeah in alot of the these Roxxon building raid missions you learn how Kreiger is essentially rushing to get nuform out in the open ignoring health issues, planning permission amd feasibility. so if it seems liked rushed idea its because it is in universe

[1:42:46] <slackerunchained> I'm reminded of the time Mr. Rogers got his car stolen, only for the thieves to return it after the story hit the news and they realized who they robbed, and it was in his drive the next day with a note reading "We are so, so very sorry."

[1:44:34] <$hattrick61> its fine. a little major concussion never hurt anyone
[1:44:38] <%Prevot> where are all these webs coming from? I wonder what it could be
[1:45:04] <+kewlmyc> What was that? Must have been my imagination.
[1:45:22] <%dds333a> "what happened to you, buddy?"
[1:45:48] <+Wulfphelz> just a social psychosis event

[1:46:11] <+Rafraud> behind you
[1:46:58] <slackerunchained> @Prevot Man. the absolute *worst* times for Spider-Man always came up whenever the current villain *also* had a spider-theme to them... Because then, not only did they usually have some way of nullifying his powers of influencing his actions, but J.J. Jameson always had legit evidence on-hand that SOMEBODY dressed like a Spider was futzing up his city...
[1:46:58] <+kewlmyc> How....

[1:51:40] <some_brave_apollo> isn't Miles' "shock" power meant to be like a toxic spider sting and not actually electrcity?
[1:51:47] <Aussie_Manny> omg the slow mo
[1:51:49] <Aussie_Manny> so sick
[1:51:52] <%Prevot> @some_brave_apollo ssshhhh
[1:51:53] <%dds333a> @some_brave_apollo in the comics, kinda
[1:52:02] <%Shad0wTag> @some_brave_apollo Bio electricity shennanigans
[1:52:06] <%dds333a> It's biochemical in the comics
[1:52:08] <%ChoculaUltra> yes, lot of people confuse the world poisonous and venomous when it comes to animals
[1:52:11] <enerkaizer> @some_brave_apollo they flip flopped the entire time how miles venom sting works. at this point every author does whatever they want with it
[1:52:12] <Aussie_Manny> Here Spider-Man is working on helping emergency responders, and cops STILL COMPLAINING! shotoStare
[1:52:24] <%ChoculaUltra> so venom is in reference to venomous spiders and what not
[1:52:31] <slackerunchained> It was the one-armed man! :O
[1:52:36] <%dds333a> @choculaultra always has been
[1:52:39] <%ChoculaUltra> but still kinda comes off as sounding dumb because of well, Venom,
[1:52:54] <Aussie_Manny> Hear that? Silent Hill monsters!
[1:52:59] <%JetpackMcQuack> so venom is actively trying to kill you
[1:53:06] <slackerunchained> What is with criminals actively-trolling EMT's today? :\
[1:53:21] <%cobalt_phoenix_> WOOOOOW
[1:53:22] <%Shad0wTag> @choculaultra In hindsight in the Ultimate universe the character Venom stopped being a thing so Miles having his power called that there was less confusong
[1:53:25] <enerkaizer> Originally it was a poison Miles used (because the very first villain he beat, electro, got beaten by this powers of his. ) if it would've been electricity back then this wouldn't have made sense for example
[1:53:27] <%ChoculaUltra> oh for sure @dds333a - just remembered people commenting on how "venom" being used to describe Miles' abilities came off as "dumb sounding" to some people
[1:53:38] <+GilroyGoldBlood> lmao

[1:54:12] <%cobalt_phoenix_> don't worry about it :)
[1:54:18] <enerkaizer> The webs Peter and Miles use only hold for 1 hour, afterwards the cops can just catch them

[1:54:28] <+Wulfphelz> luck and hope
[1:54:29] <Shardlab> The webs slowly dissolve and they fall slowly
[1:54:29] <Dante_Namikaze1> they've had 9 years to figure it out
[1:54:29] <%JetpackMcQuack> take the shot Kim
[1:54:30] <some_brave_apollo> @Shad0wTag I'm pretty sure Venom killed Miles' mom in the Ultimate universe though
[1:54:30] <BlackermanZX> they will use a trampoline dont worry bout it
[1:54:34] <%ZweihanderSteve> a ladder, a trampoline, and a knife

[1:54:58] <%dds333a> LUL LUL
[1:54:58] <Dante_Namikaze1> @some_brave_apollo he did that's why when miles went to the main universe and he first saw Venom he attacked him on site even though his mom was brought back because he still kind of remembered that

[2:05:28] <Dante_Namikaze1> @lion_kun Yes, even Thor is referenced in one of the collectibles in this game
[2:05:33] <+warlockwithapixie> WHY
[2:05:35] <%Lion_kun> Niceeee
[2:05:38] <%kyh9> Parks in cities almost always come at the cost of the under privileged
[2:05:44] <+Reverend_Roscoe> Did they put the avengers tower where the Chrysler should be?
[2:05:50] <%elderpunch> yeah american city planning doesnt tend to be good
[2:05:52] <Shardlab> One of the urban planners made the area out of spite to keep public transportation out, thus keeping the black population out since they commuted a lot via bus
[2:05:55] <enerkaizer> reminder: miles is only wearing socks. The power that allows him and peter to wallcrawl doesn't work with regular boots one

[2:33:54] <Aussie_Manny> I was also thinking Metal Gear. Be like Ocelot; infiltrate Underground deeper before leaving.
[2:33:56] <%cobalt_phoenix_> i don't think there are any
[2:33:57] <slackerunchained> There is NOW WAY that takedown was silent.
[2:34:00] <ThornJay> @shinobiphoenix i think bens current incarnation is just "Spiderman but his personal and proffesional live aren't dogshit"
[2:34:01] <+Rafraud> It just takes forever to do it stealth is all
[2:34:05] <leith_aziz> I started listening to Deus Ex OST. Man...just wow cohhO
[2:34:05] <T_Sasquatch> stealth
[2:34:09] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> invisibility trump's everything
[2:34:13] <+OddityOn> go to the ceiling
[2:34:23] <+OddityOn> or that works too LOL
[2:34:23] <%ShinobiPhoenix> also what happened to Dr Ock? I thought he was in San Fran as Superior Octopus with some new body?  now I hear he made a Superior Fantastic Four out of ALTERNATE universe versions of people who have been F4?
[2:34:30] <%elderpunch> stomp em in the NUTS
[2:34:37] <%Shad0wTag> @thornjay Right now its a company bought the IP to spiderman so he's the legally corpo sanctioned one
[2:34:41] <%dds333a> stomp em stomp em
[2:34:43] <kulmoth> *urban sneak theme*
[2:34:43] <%RyTYoung> I just like how you can dip in and out of combat with stealth, it‚Äôs so good

[2:34:53] <leith_aziz> cohhBlind
[2:34:59] <%RyTYoung> gigaboOtsBaniMorphball
[2:35:07] <slix3431> So what is the Underground called in this game?
[2:35:08] <ThornJay> @coreybom sorry got my words mixed, i meant i prefer fighting the tinkerergang to the demons because aren't several demons super mind controlled into it, to the point of being suicide bombers.
[2:35:12] <%Shad0wTag> @shinobiphoenix He made a dumb deal to Mephisto to gey his OG body and lose all of his time as Superior Spidey
[2:35:18] <+OddityOn> @shinobiphoenix I saw that, think there was a panel with him and Wolverine and he had tentacles too like Ock
[2:35:21] <leith_aziz> @slix3431 You answered your own question
[2:35:23] <%elderpunch> @shinobiphoenix dr ock is cool asf man i never heard of that
[2:35:25] <T_Sasquatch> Mephistooooo
[2:35:26] <StebTheVee> With this many recruits, there sure is a bunch of angry teenagers in NYC
[2:35:47] <%dds333a> @stebthevee more accurate than one might think
[2:35:51] <T_Sasquatch> is anyone happy in nyc LUL
[2:35:55] <%Shad0wTag> @stebthevee Totally legit
[2:36:01] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @Shad0wTag WHy?  wasn't his body dying and crumbling and he had a great new body and powers?
[2:36:06] <%Shad0wTag> @t_sasquatch If you got some fresh timbs
[2:36:14] <HarshNerf> @stebthevee you can always find angry young peeps for any cause as long as you have cool clothes
[2:36:14] <%dds333a> or just bored, disenfranchised teens, prime recruitment material
[2:36:18] <yash_lawman> You got this Woolie!!
[2:36:27] <+OddityOn> the youth love commiting violence, now they say theyre the good guys while doing it @stebthevee
[2:36:37] <+OddityOn> LUL
[2:37:01] <Dakuu75> No one ever looks up...
[2:37:08] <Aussie_Manny> Hey, I'm stealthin' here!
[2:37:14] <HarshNerf> spiderman where you hiding? it can't be on ceiling
[2:37:16] <Zantetzuken> "why are there bodies scattered across the floor?"
[2:37:17] <%ShinobiPhoenix> btw-- interesting observation I made today:  Microsoft now owns Spider-Man 2 2004... because the rights belong to Activision
[2:37:22] <%Shad0wTag> @shinobiphoenix In Superior volume 2 lets just say a dumb deal with Mephisto got him his original non super powered body. everyone hated and hates it as we undid all of his experience
[2:37:49] <Dakuu75> man, these guys all got their jet-boots on
[2:37:49] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:38:12] <Pookiedaexzile> tonight you
[2:38:14] <casualshinji> I hope we get some more super villians in fabric for the sequel instead of armor plating. So boring.
[2:38:15] <Darkdrill> lets go :D
[2:38:28] <%ShinobiPhoenix> all of the old Spider-Man games that Activision published go to Microsoft now, should they ever get the license to re-release them
[2:38:28] <%dds333a> @pookiedaexzile *stare*
[2:38:51] <KeiganOfAstora> No it's just a lot
[2:38:59] <crazy_riggs> "Guys, Spiderman's here! He's taking us all down! HE'S WEARING TIMBS!"
[2:39:17] <ThornJay> @shinobiphoenix for some reason I cant picture sony giving the okay on that one
[2:39:17] <KeiganOfAstora> Hit things with your webs to make them walk a certain direction
[2:39:21] <HarshNerf> @shinobiphoenix i don't think sony would ever re-license spiderman for those games
[2:39:34] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @ThornJay it's not Sony's say, it's Disney's
[2:39:39] <+Rafraud> This one takes so long lol
[2:39:42] <Make_me_mad> I just hope, in the sequel, there's actually interesting things to do post-game. Give me some low-level villains that respawn on a cooldown. Let me punch the shocker every other day or something.
[2:39:44] <Pookiedaexzile> Miles Leaves and Spiderman shows up
[2:39:51] <Pookiedaexzile> No ones gonna be the wiser
[2:40:03] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it's not like OTHER games with Spider-Man in them exist
[2:40:06] <QueequegTheater> That happens in Arkham
[2:40:08] <%MajorCrasher> honestly Microsoft might end up buying Sony at this point
[2:40:19] <%ShinobiPhoenix> and Sony doesn't ahve the capital to fight MS about paying Disney for it
[2:40:28] <DXLelouch24> tell that to Batman
[2:40:29] <slackerunchained> "Did everybody go on break?" :\
[2:40:33] <HyperSonicX99> Say that to Batman
[2:40:38] <Pookiedaexzile> Mircosofts gonna fuck around buy disney
[2:40:38] <HarshNerf> @majorcrasher no way Japan lets that happen
[2:40:43] <QueequegTheater> DEAD
[2:40:48] <%ncr7wms3r22b7n3> he's fiiiiine
[2:40:49] <ThornJay> @shinobiphoenix I don't think they have to fight at all
[2:41:01] <%ShinobiPhoenix> in fact, Sony tries to t ake way toom uch control over Spider-Man in everythign that doesn't belongto them and Disney ABSOLUTELY HATES THAT
[2:41:01] <OblivionSword1> he's on the wall it's fine
[2:41:06] <DXLelouch24> @Pookiedaexzile your high if you think Microsoft can step to the Mouses money
[2:41:18] <%MajorCrasher> @harshnerf I think it's definitely possible of they throw out a big enough number. 70billion is a lot
[2:41:19] <HyperSonicX99> Microsoft buying Sony??? Not in a million years
[2:41:29] <StebTheVee> Phin in like a teenager and she made ALL THAT tech in a year? She has a lot of time in her hands. Hell, she could've solved a better energy source than Roxxon
[2:41:32] <ThornJay> @shinobiphoenix to be fair, They Own Him. I agree it's shitty though.
[2:41:37] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Spider-Man is still in Ultimate Alliance 3 (Switch) and Marvel Infinite
[2:41:46] <%ShinobiPhoenix> they don't own Spiderman at all
[2:41:47] <QueequegTheater> @DXLelouch24 Microsoft is literally worth ten times what Disney is
[2:41:57] <slackerunchained> @StebTheVee She's kinda got revenge occupying her thoughts...
[2:41:58] <yash_lawman> how do you know? What if it was Daredevil
[2:42:06] <DXLelouch24> yes but Disney has the infinite money machine that is the mcu
[2:42:06] <Indigo_Automaton> Nice
[2:42:10] <%Tuffty> Good job Woolie
[2:42:12] <%ShinobiPhoenix> they have the MOVIE rights and they made the game on Playstation
[2:42:12] <ThornJay> there's a 3rd ultimate alliance game? what crossover event did they use?
[2:42:23] <%DkLordG> WHEN I WAS A BOY...
[2:42:25] <yash_lawman> üëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëè good job
[2:42:27] <%ShinobiPhoenix> they don't have Book, they don't have exclusive rights to games
[2:42:36] <QueequegTheater> @DXLelouch24 Disney's full market cap value is 230 billion. Microsoft's is 2.3 TRILLION (USD obviously)
[2:42:39] <%Prevot> he loved white walls
[2:42:52] <Dr_Mooose> speen
[2:42:52] <%ShinobiPhoenix> they PAY to keep some things exclusive, but they dno't own anything and people can just say no
[2:42:54] <%dds333a> @thornjay MCU flavor
[2:42:56] <%Shad0wTag> Remember Kingpin is a massive weaboo
[2:43:05] <%MajorCrasher> yeah Microsoft could definitely buy Sony at that worth lmao

[2:43:35] <QueequegTheater> nagCheck barrel nagCheck
[2:43:35] <yash_lawman> King pin was always a weeb
[2:43:38] <+solracc25> Why the oil drum?

[2:52:16] <Aussie_Manny> It's a certain kind of token though, isn't it?
[2:52:21] <jackedup92> he landed on the very abundant puddles in this game
[2:52:28] <%mr_sups> The Shit Suit
[2:52:29] <QueequegTheater> But it's the suit from the climax of the movie?
[2:52:31] <wibbwobbler> Tech parts are marked separately
[2:52:34] <+DFDEDSDCD> This is the hoodie-on-suit style I like, similar to Gwen's Ghost Spider. Ben Reilly's "workout hoodie over spider suit" works for a bit but, personally, doesn't work as a consistent suit.
[2:52:35] <QueequegTheater> Why would it not be that?
[2:52:38] <Aussie_Manny> Woolz wanted the suit, kicks and jacket from the What's Up Danger scene.
[2:52:38] <%kyh9> Most of the movie, he's in an ill-fitting spiderman halloween costume
[2:52:53] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> No Refunds
[2:52:53] <%CappuccinoGuil> Why would it NOT be the suit from the climax?
[2:52:53] <dragonfist95> Idk if it‚Äôs most of the movie
[2:52:55] <%Shad0wTag> Oh hey Project Pegasus!
[2:53:03] <%emptyantics> Woolie most of the movie he‚Äôs wearing the size too small spidey outfit
[2:53:03] <+FennecZephyr> Yeah, the closest analogue would be the suit Miles starts this game in
[2:53:13] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @OddityOn Peter knows he should never piss off Ororo Munroe
[2:53:17] <Aussie_Manny> That is THE Spider-Verse suit though.
[2:53:37] <%cobalt_phoenix_> does the 24 fps mod work on all suits?
[2:53:40] <Aussie_Manny> The frame rate style will be fun to see though.
[2:53:41] <%CappuccinoGuil> Like, for most of the movie he's in the training one.
[2:53:49] <%CappuccinoGuil> The poorly-fitted suit, I mean
[2:53:55] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @cobalt_phoenix_ yes, but it doesn't look as good since they aren't made for it
[2:53:59] <yash_lawman> did woolie do all the peter training missons?
[2:54:14] <slackerunchained> I'm getting a sense of Deja-vu...
[2:54:26] <%dds333a> @slackerunchained Kappa
[2:54:26] <stevenellis386> so thats what miles sounds like, huh?
[2:54:33] <%Shad0wTag> @yash_lawman Not yet
[2:54:34] <+Kyma1020> I think it had to many parts for 24 fps mode while a simple suit would be easier to animate
[2:54:37] <coreybom> I think he‚Äôll most have that version in Spider-Man 2, since he‚Äôs getting a new version in Across the Spider-Verse.
[2:54:43] <stevenellis386> his voice is higher than I thought
[2:55:02] <QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Cars count as walls
[2:55:07] <+BackwardCap> Its been how long and these guys still wearing the orange prison uniform sajamErnie
[2:55:08] <+DFDEDSDCD> Just knock them down and web them. No need for positioning for that.
[2:55:12] <MinersLoveGames> nice
[2:55:13] <yash_lawman> @shad0wtag ok thanks was just curious
[2:55:14] <stevenellis386> nice suit
[2:55:26] <Aussie_Manny> Tech Parts.
[2:55:33] <Aussie_Manny> üîß
[2:56:00] <+OddityOn> I hope they give Peter the Superior Spiderman suits, they're cool

[2:56:09] <Dakuu75> that guy is gonna believe in ghosts after that
[2:56:15] <%Shad0wTag> @yash_lawman No worries fam
[2:56:17] <Aussie_Manny> NO ONE would believe him. It's New York. LUL
[2:56:35] <%dds333a> @dakuu75 and he'd be correct LUL
[2:56:51] <Aussie_Manny> Broke-ass superheroes are both wish fulfilment AND relatable.
[2:56:53] <%CappuccinoGuil> "There's nothing like a broke ass superhero" and that's why Tom Holland's spiderman sucks
[2:56:59] <Aussie_Manny> I wish Hancock was a better movie...
[2:57:06] <%dds333a> Dude got bumped by THE Ghost, corporate spy
[2:57:07] <dragonfist95> I know there‚Äôs limited time due to the recording sessions but taking the train in spiderman games should be a crime
[2:57:24] <T_Sasquatch> No way home is a really weird movie
[2:57:29] <Dr_Mooose> and the gun?
[2:57:34] <Darkdrill> hacker shooting
[2:57:34] <T_Sasquatch> its not bad but it feels forced ?
[2:57:38] <+ReallyBigRocks> why are you shooting tho?
[2:57:51] <+OddityOn> @cappuccinoguil hey, Peter is still a tech genius, we all know he'll have his own little Parker Industries by the end of the next MCU movie
[2:57:55] <Aussie_Manny> lmao
[2:58:02] <kulmoth> so they hare just shooting up new york in general? Real good guy stuff i see
[2:58:07] <emeraldskrull> Just go in
[2:58:19] <Aussie_Manny> This is a crazy mission.
[2:58:27] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[2:58:27] <+Rafraud> videogames
[2:58:37] <+DFDEDSDCD> you can use camo to go back into stealth mode.
[2:58:41] <T_Sasquatch> talk about wally carries LUL
[2:58:45] <T_Sasquatch> Wall damn
[2:58:47] <leith_aziz> Hi chat. Im back
[2:58:48] <dragonfist95> Just venom punch while in camo it‚Äôll count it
[2:58:48] <bryxobryx> How long has this been going on? Should I wait to watch the whole@thing?
[2:58:52] <stevenellis386> that bitch is dead
[2:58:52] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1483311049713635328?s=20
[2:58:53] <coreybom> @oddityon Ehh, with the way no way home ended, i doubt he‚Äôll have enough for a better apartment.
[2:58:57] <bryxobryx> Yeah, I‚Äôm gonna.
[2:59:11] <+Rafraud> no shut up tho
[2:59:17] <morkelebmink> you should get a automatic 'mission fail' and have to restart from check point if you kick ANYONE off a roof
[2:59:38] <kulmoth> Miles i think your girlfriend might be fucking stupid
[2:59:46] <%MajorCrasher> @morkelebmink nah they're fine tho
[2:59:47] <%Dabrikishaw> knijohDab
[2:59:51] <+DFDEDSDCD> as long as you take them out in camo, it doesn't really matter how you do it, even if stealth is over.
[3:00:05] <%dds333a> get shoryu'd
[3:00:34] <+OddityOn> @coreybom watch when they introduce F4/Xmen, they'll give Peter an internship or let him stay for a while
[3:00:53] <%Shad0wTag> @coreybom I mean man has to get a GED and everything from scratch since he y'know no longer exists
[3:01:00] <+OddityOn> that's my theory at least
[3:01:15] <Aussie_Manny> it's fine. hopefully this'll be two Tech tokens
[3:01:18] <%Tuffty> Uhh
[3:01:20] <+ReallyBigRocks> uh
[3:01:21] <Awesome_Leaf> ???
[3:01:21] <%ZweihanderSteve> YOU GOOD??
[3:01:21] <%Shad0wTag> @oddityon Mutant internship sounds funny to me
[3:01:22] <Dr_Mooose> there he goes
[3:01:23] <stevenellis386> this time?
[3:01:24] <%dds333a> LUL
[3:01:29] <+DFDEDSDCD> these missions keep showing up, so as you level up and get new skills/equipment you can keep trying.
[3:01:30] <QueequegTheater> @Shad0wTag That's not that hard for someone as smart as Peter though
[3:01:31] <IvanMistwalker> Tsundere Security Guard
[3:01:38] <StebTheVee> he planets needs him
[3:01:53] <+OddityOn> @shad0wtag it'll be an easy way to match him up with Kitty since that was a thing
[3:01:57] <%ZweihanderSteve> he flip!
[3:01:59] <ThornJay> tbh i just wanna see mcu peter interacting with daredevil
[3:01:59] <Aussie_Manny> DO A FLIP
[3:02:03] <coreybom> @shad0wtag God the ending of no way home is WAY more depressing when you really look at it. He‚Äôs really alone.
[3:02:07] <%Shad0wTag> @queequegtheater the problem will be him juggling stuff
[3:02:08] <Pookiedaexzile> Showtime Spidey
[3:02:09] <%cobalt_phoenix_> what do the underground labs give? tech parts?
[3:02:14] <kulmoth> I can't help but think about that mgs5 voiceline about the helicopter bullets cutting a man in half
[3:02:15] <fluke_LKZ> HE DID A FLIP
[3:02:16] <StebTheVee> it's new york
[3:02:17] <crazy_riggs> Underground, in NYC weather, is legit a freezer.
[3:02:18] <brachydios777> It‚Äôs winter
[3:02:20] <%MajorCrasher> American trains don't have heaters I think
[3:02:21] <+BackwardCap> They got heating, shrug
[3:02:25] <MAX116030> NY train I guess
[3:02:25] <%dds333a> there's a rumor that spider man is helpful
[3:02:27] <ThornJay> @coreybom still swinging though
[3:02:28] <Madinki> Winter in NY can get serious
[3:02:40] <QueequegTheater> @Shad0wTag The GED only requires high school knowledge, Peter wouldn't have to take prep classes or anything.
[3:02:46] <MinersLoveGames> NYC Subway winters are freezing cold on top of being dirty as fuck.
[3:02:48] <sporeian94> Only thing missing is the homeless guy pooping on the train, real NY experience
[3:02:52] <Aussie_Manny> Shit, I haven't been on public transport in 2 and a half years.
[3:03:04] <+ReallyBigRocks> who could possibly be doing this?
[3:03:06] <%Shad0wTag> @coreybom Man has to start from scratch, no public records, ID pretty much any proof he's real. He gets a new game + except everything bugged out and has no benefits
[3:03:09] <%ZweihanderSteve> someone, or some SPIDER MAN
[3:03:13] <coreybom> @oddityon Kitty is the minor leagues, Felicia on the other hand.
[3:03:25] <%megaman_sentinel> ded
[3:03:27] <%Indigo_Automaton> DEAD
[3:03:27] <KeiganOfAstora> Let them hit the ground, then web them. Quick takedown
[3:03:37] <tentavision> i was on a train in nyc in winter and it was heated. can't speak for all of them though
[3:03:37] <%resloxxx> NEVER KILLED ANYONE
[3:03:44] <coreybom> @thornjay Still swinging. Its the spider-man way. Suffer, but go on.
[3:03:46] <+BackwardCap> Imagine being a mook who has to eat that combo
[3:03:48] <%dds333a> @coreybom he's saying they dated, which they did LUL
[3:04:02] <%Shad0wTag> @queequegtheater But can you believe he'd totally miss exams cuz if super heroing or good job interviews either
[3:04:03] <+ReallyBigRocks> yeyeye
[3:04:03] <crazy_riggs> Add the VIBE mod
[3:04:07] <Aussie_Manny> Yeeeeeh!
[3:04:07] <stevenellis386> so is miles morales worth the buy,chat?
[3:04:08] <KeiganOfAstora> YE YE YE
[3:04:12] <ThornJay> @shad0wtag so the way it works is that everything spiderman did still happened right? So are the avengers and fury still aware of him but just leaving him for some reason?
[3:04:12] <KeiganOfAstora> Game goes to 30fps
[3:04:13] <Aussie_Manny> WHAT'S UP DANGER
[3:04:20] <KeiganOfAstora> But just on Miles
[3:04:20] <+BackwardCap> The fps patch
[3:04:23] <tentavision> @stevenellis386  yes
[3:04:24] <%emptyantics> WHATS UP DANGER
[3:04:29] <Aussie_Manny> CAN'T STOP ME NOW
[3:04:31] <MinersLoveGames> for just the suit and character, that's it
[3:04:36] <coreybom> @dds333a Oh i know, its just that FELICIA is the real catch. She is best girl.
[3:04:38] <%dds333a> DON'T BE A STRANGER
[3:04:39] <%cobalt_phoenix_> YEAAAAAAAHHH
[3:04:40] <Dr_Mooose> YOOOO PogChamp
[3:04:41] <Dakuu75> DOPE
[3:04:41] <%Indigo_Automaton> Woah
[3:04:42] <slackerunchained> Yoooooo~!
[3:04:43] <tetrabrick1lt> skipped frames LUL
[3:04:43] <%baka_sugoi> sp00nPOG
[3:04:43] <Estuko> OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[3:04:44] <OblivionSword1> does it work with other suits ?
[3:04:44] <%kyh9> SO GOOD
[3:04:45] <T_Sasquatch> AUGHHHHHH
[3:04:46] <+OddityOn> @coreybom ehh I don't think they would add Felicia to the MCU yet or at all
[3:04:47] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[3:04:48] <%Dabrikishaw> What's up danger
[3:04:50] <@Solidus_113> FPS suit
[3:04:51] <KeiganOfAstora> It huruts my eyes
[3:04:52] <%mr_sups> ON 2S!
[3:04:53] <T_Sasquatch> I FEEL SICK
[3:04:54] <yash_lawman> lmao nice.
[3:04:54] <+OddityOn> YEAH THIS WAS GREAT
[3:04:54] <%MajorCrasher> LUL
[3:04:55] <+Jiggisnipe> it hurts
[3:04:55] <%Shad0wTag> @thornjay People know Spider-Man, Peter Parker fundementally never existed
[3:04:56] <%kyh9> It's really interesting tbh
[3:04:56] <Dr_Mooose> that took WORK
[3:04:58] <Aussie_Manny> Like HOW???
[3:04:59] <stevenellis386> @tentavision even if I have the ps4 spiderman?
[3:05:02] <+AkronymCLT> only on the animations
[3:05:04] <Dio_TR> It looks so dope!
[3:05:04] <KeiganOfAstora> Movies do it a lot with CGI, it's coool
[3:05:05] <Darkdrill> it looks stunning
[3:05:05] <wibbwobbler> SeemsGood SeemsGood
[3:05:08] <QueequegTheater> It's so fucking weird
[3:05:08] <brachydios777> Magic
[3:05:09] <%AlteisenReiseZ> NOW FIND THE TALLEST BUILDING
[3:05:11] <%RyTYoung> Oh shit I forgot the cell shaded one isn‚Äôt the animated one NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[3:05:11] <Awesome_Leaf> wow thats wild
[3:05:12] <%townzzzzz> 15 fps movement
[3:05:13] <Madinki> OH GOD I CAN'T LOOK AT IT
[3:05:15] <%dds333a> @coreybom fair, but I know a guy who would vehemently disagree LUL
[3:05:15] <%mr_sups> It's a filter
[3:05:17] <+3rdstrikejunky> wwwwwooooooowwwwww
[3:05:18] <KeiganOfAstora> Use the other Spider-Verse Visor-Mod
[3:05:19] <Aussie_Manny> God, it's EXACTLY like the movie.
[3:05:23] <%RyTYoung> It‚Äôs insane
[3:05:24] <lotharrio> That does hurt my eyes, yeah.
[3:05:32] <KeiganOfAstora> @WoolieVersus There's also a visor-mod to get BAMF and POW
[3:05:35] <ThornJay> @coreybom literally one of the only things I hate about Superior Spiderman, why they gotta do the girl like that
[3:05:37] <@Solidus_113> it's mostly keyframing isn't it?
[3:05:37] <+CatastropheCorvid> It's not that challenging. It's just a different animation set with half the frames.
[3:05:39] <%mr_sups> I want a game with this Style
[3:05:40] <T_Sasquatch> the artsyle looks good but man i respect it and hate it at the same time
[3:05:43] <@Solidus_113> the same way strive does it
[3:05:46] <Aussie_Manny> Wait, this is hurting peoples' eyes?
[3:05:48] <slackerunchained> "But they totally could, and it was awesome..."
[3:05:55] <%kyh9> It's a complicated thing to get the suit to move in its own framerate in real tie
[3:05:55] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:06:03] <OblivionSword1> damn it works really well
[3:06:03] <%baka_sugoi> SICK
[3:06:05] <KeiganOfAstora> It being so cartoony makes the realistic stuff look that much more real
[3:06:09] <%RyTYoung> It‚Äôs so good
[3:06:14] <Dio_TR> My brain is breaking from seeing the effect but it does look good
[3:06:14] <SmortyPuffin> it's cool, but it hurts my eyes
[3:06:15] <Awesome_Leaf> miles being in a different framerate from the dudes hes punching looks so odd lol
[3:06:20] <%JetpackMcQuack> hah
[3:06:23] <+ReallyBigRocks> ericbYikes
[3:06:25] <bananajuicce> Kinda makes me sick tbh, my eyes are not agreeing with it.
[3:06:28] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> most ppl I talk to still dont know what frame rate is even though they play games
[3:06:30] <some_brave_apollo> i don't really think this looks good
[3:06:42] <KeiganOfAstora> It's supposed to look janky
[3:06:44] <%RyTYoung> It‚Äôs faithful at leadt
[3:06:47] <stevenellis386> yea it looks kinda awkward to me
[3:06:47] <kulmoth> this fucks my brain
[3:06:49] <%JetpackMcQuack> hit or miss
[3:06:49] <crazy_riggs> Imagine what these guys will say in prison. Spiderman was skiping frames!
[3:06:49] <coreybom> @oddityon They have been getting a little more sexier in the films, with eternals having a full on sex scene. I can see them having felicia by the 5th film maybe.
[3:06:51] <Aussie_Manny> I'm so looking forward to Spider-Verse 2
[3:06:51] <%RyTYoung> Least*
[3:06:52] <KeiganOfAstora> @WoolieVersus There's also a visor mod, check it out
[3:06:52] <dragonfist95> Those venom hits have so much power behind them bro
[3:06:56] <+theoldone001> I think it looks cool for traversal but kind of jarring for combat
[3:06:58] <+capybruhArt> I love it dearly
[3:06:58] <%cobalt_phoenix_> i think it looks cool for a bit but then it gets odd for extended time
[3:06:59] <+Jiggisnipe> imagine what they see
[3:07:01] <%kyh9> Well, Spider-verse is arguably the most popular version of Miles
[3:07:06] <0lu_Kayode> is it just that skin?
[3:07:07] <+FennecZephyr> It probably feels better to see it in Fidelity mode
[3:07:12] <%kyh9> LOOK AT THE LIGHTING
[3:07:16] <%kyh9> GOD, THAT LIGHTING ON THE SUIT
[3:07:16] <NeetKiller> doesnt it also have the sound effects appear
[3:07:17] <stevenellis386> I appreciate the effort that was put into this suit tho
[3:07:18] <KeiganOfAstora> Not the skin, it's a suit mod
[3:07:19] <%kyh9> WITH THE DOT SHADING
[3:07:21] <%mr_sups> He's even got Halftone Shading.
[3:07:21] <cj_art> gotta love the screen tone effect too
[3:07:23] <+Rafraud> Accessibility
[3:07:25] <KeiganOfAstora> There's a visor mod too
[3:07:31] <ThornJay> @coreybom but will Disney have the balls to show them being exhibitionist rooftop degenerates tho
[3:07:32] <Aussie_Manny> What's it look like without the mod?
[3:07:33] <0lu_Kayode> @KeiganOfAstora neat
[3:07:39] <%RyTYoung> The whole game becomes spiderverse style
[3:07:53] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> yo those combats are my main pick for this game
[3:08:04] <Aussie_Manny> Good suit.
[3:08:13] <coreybom> @thornjay If they aren‚Äôt cowards.
[3:08:20] <%dds333a> @thornjay irresponsible superhero sex, here we go LUL
[3:08:23] <Aussie_Manny> Save it for Comic-Con, Woolie. :P
[3:08:27] <lotharrio> They lack that exaggerate swagger...
[3:08:30] <crazy_riggs> Mile is actually a Sith Lord
[3:08:38] <Pookiedaexzile> Whats teh green one
[3:08:43] <Pookiedaexzile> Baja Blast
[3:08:51] <Aussie_Manny> The End is still the sickest casual suit.
[3:08:51] <%mr_sups> I like the propotions of the Spider-Verse Suits
[3:08:52] <KaiserMario> Spiderman 2 is comig
[3:08:53] <+SolidusRex> The spray paint spider stand a out enough
[3:08:53] <ThornJay> until disney shows felicia getting rawdogged on a ney york rooftop, they're filthy cowards
[3:08:56] <enerkaizer> clone saga game?
[3:09:02] <VincentGraves> in spiderman 2
[3:09:04] <tentavision> @pookiedaexzile  prowler styled suit
[3:09:10] <%Shad0wTag> @thornjay fucking what dude
[3:09:15] <yash_lawman> my favorite suit.
[3:09:21] <QueequegTheater> @ThornJay based
[3:09:29] <QueequegTheater> Also give sauce
[3:09:36] <+Rafraud> LETS GOOOOOOOOOOO
[3:09:43] <%kyh9> GET OUT OF HERE, CRINGE
[3:09:44] <Aussie_Manny> Danika! LUL
[3:10:01] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[3:10:03] <%TheAntitype> Miles is so cute, I love him
[3:10:05] <+OddityOn> @coreybom not a lot of people were welcoming to that sex scene in their pg-13 movie tho from what I saw so I really doubt they'll add Felicia in for that reason. but also cause lore wise it'd be better to introduce Spidey to the X-Men or F4 first so he could get back on his feet
[3:10:12] <Aussie_Manny> Love hearing Ashly Burch.
[3:10:19] <Aussie_Manny> Voices so many peeps now.
[3:10:20] <+BackwardCap> How does SHE know that gildedThink
[3:10:25] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> "Remember to drink water Spider-Man!"
[3:10:26] <%Shad0wTag> Yez
[3:10:28] <%emptyantics> Danika üò¥
[3:10:32] <+Kyma1020> Yes
[3:10:32] <%Shad0wTag> There are multiple recordings
[3:10:34] <%cobalt_phoenix_> yea
[3:10:40] <+SolidusRex> Yeah
[3:10:43] <crazy_riggs> Yeah, if you're swinging, running, hiding, or other activities, Peter's pitch would change
[3:10:45] <OblivionSword1> I remember that being a thing
[3:10:50] <T_Sasquatch> i cant believe they put that much effort into
[3:10:52] <SmortyPuffin> walking vs swinging
[3:10:52] <%RyTYoung> Yup
[3:10:55] <%Shad0wTag> One while swinging, one while being still, hiding ect
[3:11:01] <QueequegTheater> DEAD
[3:11:02] <+capybruhArt> pretty sure it's inthis one too
[3:11:07] <Aussie_Manny> A ghost takedown
[3:11:08] <%Kaito_Cam> Also while he was swinging becasue he's exerting himself
[3:11:16] <tentavision> he sounds winded when he's swinging too
[3:11:23] <+BackwardCap> Did that guy just bounce

[3:13:22] <%Shad0wTag> @woolieversus You can yank their weapons in combat and make sure its a KO
[3:13:25] <+OddityOn> I could see Insomniac doing that but that'd be a bit too on the nose
[3:13:41] <%cobalt_phoenix_> if i was a criminal and saw even a TRACE of a web, i'd just peace the fuck out of there
[3:13:53] <Tanairium_> !uptime

[3:24:16] <Aussie_Manny> Miles is fluent in 3 languages.
[3:24:20] <yash_lawman> there's some SWAG on those handsigns
[3:24:24] <%kyh9> Polyglotton
[3:24:26] <stevenellis386> im sure everybody would chill with miles
[3:24:29] <%kyh9> Poly-glutton
[3:24:29] <%hax_metatron> That's when you want to fuck multiple languages
[3:24:31] <+Ricky_Rexx> Polyhanded
[3:24:37] <T_Sasquatch> Polygluttony sounds like a kojima thing
[3:24:40] <Pookiedaexzile> Fluent in 3 languages and still don't know the way of the Spider
[3:24:45] <+samuraiknack> Ya'll ready for Spice Lord

[3:24:57] <%kyh9> @T_Sasquatch It's the debilitating condition of eating many different foods

[3:25:06] <QueequegTheater> 2.5 languages isn't exactly a polyglot though
[3:25:21] <%mr_sups> YET

[3:25:42] <QueequegTheater> Fuck you, Britain
[3:25:46] <+Ricky_Rexx> The real questions is, if she's deaf why does she need earmuffs?
[3:25:46] <T_Sasquatch> finding out there are different sign languages pissed me off tbh
[3:25:55] <stevenellis386> yikes
[3:25:57] <slackerunchained> HAND ACCENTS ARE ACTUALLY A THING.
[3:25:57] <%JetpackMcQuack> what the fuck is a torch
[3:25:59] <%jonblnt> I still like Phin

[3:27:42] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @majorcrasher for real
[3:27:55] <T_Sasquatch> now im thinking of sign language slurs
[3:28:02] <Aussie_Manny> It's a niche skill. Generally, I think you wouldn't learn SL unless you need to.
[3:28:03] <brachydios777> Is ASL usa only or North America?
[3:28:22] <%dds333a> @t_sasquatch I know a bit of that LUL
[3:28:41] <%dds333a> @brachydios777 north, I think
[3:28:54] <%dds333a> other countries have their own
[3:28:57] <QueequegTheater> Kappa
[3:29:10] <sendart> now its Greek to you
[3:29:14] <%MajorCrasher> if you don't use it you lose it
[3:29:17] <%dds333a> Was it Koine Kappa
[3:29:26] <Aussie_Manny> Woolie took some Greek? Hah. Same.
[3:29:28] <+FuqBoiSlim> Scandinavian Sign Langauge gotta go crazy. I know it does
[3:29:31] <brachydios777> I lost most of my German
[3:29:32] <+Rafraud> Is this sound effect for the elevator from sonic lol
[3:29:37] <QueequegTheater> @dds333a Attic Gang
[3:29:47] <+Reverend_Roscoe> ASL has roots in French Sign Language

[3:30:52] <+Iwaitodai> good job miles you narrowed down your identity for the mob boss
[3:30:52] <0lu_Kayode> nice
[3:30:53] <+OddityOn> it's not about the money Spiderman...
[3:30:55] <+capybruhArt> its the mets love the mets
[3:30:56] <+vaderxyz1970> How does he fit in a car!?
[3:30:56] <crazy_riggs> What was that living wall speaking just now?
[3:30:59] <%Shad0wTag> @woolieversus Reggie I can relate when I move from Italy to the UK, I knew zero English. Within a year, I had to go to an English school and I started losing Italian immediately
[3:31:02] <%CappuccinoGuil> Spidahman, it's not about the money. It's about THE METS, LET'S GO METS, LOVE THE METS BABY!
[3:31:03] <StebTheVee> Only 2 percent of his body is fat
[3:31:03] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> It's not always about the money shpider man
[3:31:05] <cj_art> he is comically large
[3:31:07] <glass_marcus> just a block of muscle
[3:31:07] <%Zero_Jacks> its all about the Mets Baby
[3:31:09] <%MajorCrasher> spider verse kingpin is incredible
[3:31:13] <MadBaller123> Why does Fisk remind me of a mix of Nick Offerman + Patrick Warburton mixed together
[3:31:14] <pickles4nickles> he is large and he is pointing
[3:31:15] <Aussie_Manny> He takes up the entire screen.
[3:31:17] <%mr_sups> Spider-Verse Fisk is GREAT
[3:31:18] <%RyTYoung> Kingpin: ‚ÄúThis is my sweet gamer pad, you can tell by the knocked over gaming chairs‚Äù Kappa
[3:31:26] <ErikFeral> i love how kingpin is still an active threat even in jail
[3:31:29] <%mr_sups> @Zero_Jacks DA METS!
[3:31:33] <%LozsCat> Literally two fridges and a head
[3:31:35] <MAX116030> I cant take this Fisk seriously because I listen to critical role and all I hear is Travis
[3:31:43] <Parapattern> Love da Mets
[3:31:49] <0lu_Kayode> i think hes canonically like 90% muscle
[3:31:53] <%CoffeeKaiju> Lets go baby love da mets
[3:31:56] <%CoffeeKaiju> hit a home run
[3:31:57] <stevenellis386> look you can chill with whoever you want spidey, just remember to keep that mask on
[3:31:59] <MadBaller123> The absolute size of that lad
[3:32:02] <some_brave_apollo> Another issue with Miles useing the name Spider-Man is that he literally just used Pete's private name out loud when he otherwise could have called him Spider-Man
[3:32:11] <Pookiedaexzile> RIght hand corner in the office
[3:32:20] <%emptyantics> Speaking 3 languages is nice but not having soneone to practice Japanese with made me forget alot of it
[3:32:20] <Puhff> DA METS
[3:32:21] <+vaderxyz1970> Why doesn't fisk just ren for mayor or something to be incharge
[3:32:35] <+Jiggisnipe> what
[3:32:36] <+OddityOn> pretty sure he's done that in some universe or story
[3:32:38] <MinersLoveGames> I'm similar. I know quite a bit of German and Russian from my time playing CoD games.
[3:32:42] <crazy_riggs> Just haley!
[3:32:43] <MadBaller123> @vaderxyz1970  the ol Lex Luthor trick!

[3:34:55] <Pookiedaexzile> Pulled out the Nine
[3:34:59] <QueequegTheater> weapon swap
[3:35:03] <MAX116030> The funny thing with languages is that some of them have pretty strong connection. Like learning Turkish helps you learns most languages of Central Asia because they all have Turk roots but other thing is apparently Korean has similar grammar structure. Which kind a explains how polyglots can learn more languages
[3:35:05] <ErikFeral> "How are we suppose to fight him in the air?" says man with RPG
[3:35:08] <Fauna_NE> The blockstring
[3:35:17] <Fauna_NE> he blocked the cross-up
[3:35:29] <Aussie_Manny> Are these big balls a real landmark in Harlem?
[3:35:36] <+Suneater_Jerome> damn man just got hit into a wallsplat combo L
[3:35:46] <%Shad0wTag> @max116030 I hear you. Being Italian essentially give me cheat codes to French and Spanish without learning because they all share words thanks to Latin origins

[4:13:56] <%cobalt_phoenix_> GREAT SKILL
[4:14:02] <+vaderxyz1970> It's just a knife
[4:14:03] <niffinbox> Supahsexystylin!
[4:14:06] <ErikFeral> you ruined a rooftop restaraunt to train
[4:14:06] <%Juriasu> the combat in these games really is great
[4:14:14] <%atlasdotwav> Instant kill activate
[4:14:26] <NireFuster> I generally find the arkham style combat to be pretty boring but this game looks like it has a lot more to it
[4:14:31] <boogz____> How about traversal in Central Park Kappa
[4:14:31] <%ShinobiPhoenix> that's still HYPER useful
[4:14:36] <Aussie_Manny> !uptime
[4:14:37] <@Moobot> @Aussie_Manny WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 4 hours and 28 minutes
[4:14:38] <NireFuster> Lot more options it seems
[4:14:46] <yash_lawman> yes
[4:15:05] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @WoolieVersus yes, that's why you should buy the Wall Rocket move
[4:15:06] <HyperSonicX99> Venom Fang
[4:15:08] <%Juriasu> venom dash launcher is hype
[4:15:09] <%cobalt_phoenix_> YEYEYE
[4:15:13] <OblivionSword1> YO LAUNCHER
[4:15:16] <AnthonyJMax> combos
[4:15:26] <HyperSonicX99> Combo video time
[4:15:31] <brachydios777> Strong
[4:15:38] <%emptyantics> Venom Strike
[4:16:06] <%ShinobiPhoenix> never underestimate the Venom Wall Rocket
[4:16:07] <%Juriasu> on the other hand you won't be able to get all of them and that one could have been safely ignored imo
[4:16:26] <lotharrio> Do gadgets take tech, or challenge tokens to upgrade?
[4:16:28] <+vaderxyz1970> Venom punch, Venom kick, Venom KISS
[4:16:45] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:16:45] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Venom Wall Rocket is essentially a free poor man's Venom Dash
[4:16:56] <yash_lawman> yeah that seems better.
[4:17:06] <NireFuster> Man this naming convention is gonna be suuuper awkard in Marvel's Spiderman 2
[4:17:09] <%Juriasu> the air ko's one was pretty hard I remember
[4:17:15] <HyperSonicX99> Venom Jump while web slinging
[4:17:23] <slackerunchained> Except maybe Taskmaster. :P
[4:17:32] <+vaderxyz1970> I mean I saw Jumper
[4:17:32] <+ReallyBigRocks> Hulk jumps are fun
[4:17:39] <jorniev> teleportation can be fun
[4:17:45] <+0neReeler> Batman
[4:17:45] <%emptyantics> Daredevil parkours which is cool
[4:17:50] <NeetKiller> Iron-man can be fun
[4:17:55] <%cobalt_phoenix_> hell yeah
[4:18:00] <Dakuu75> Cole from the Infamous games had really fun movement
[4:18:08] <VincentGraves> broke his back
[4:18:15] <jorniev> THE THING I want the most about the spider man powers is the spider Sense

[4:18:18] <NireFuster> It'd be super interesting to play as a superhero that cannot web swing but still freely moves around the city
[4:18:40] <+MegaQuint> AERIAL RAVE
[4:18:45] <%ShinobiPhoenix> oh this annoying ass challenge
[4:18:52] <NireFuster> Trick gun sword trick gun sword trick
[4:19:03] <%Indigo_Automaton> @NireFuster Play Infamous
[4:19:05] <slackerunchained> I liked the mobility in Prototype, but wasn't quite as keen on all the civilian casualties it caused. :\
[4:19:10] <HyperSonicX99> Marvel 3 air combo
[4:19:13] <%ShinobiPhoenix> there's a trick, you can't THROW enemies or use moves that kill them on the ground
[4:19:18] <NireFuster> Prototype 1 was super cool
[4:19:18] <MAX116030> IF you control the angle of entry and exit of teleportation then you can get results like portal game. Jump from height teleport and exit via momentum as if you are launched
[4:19:24] <NireFuster> @Indigo_Automaton I've always wanted to, but isn't it PS exclusive?
[4:19:33] <niffinbox> use web yank in air?
[4:19:38] <+vaderxyz1970> Keep the rythum up don't drop the combo
[4:19:38] <%Indigo_Automaton> @NireFuster Yeah unfortunately
[4:19:46] <HyperSonicX99> You can use air yank
[4:19:52] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Air Marshal is the best
[4:20:04] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Air Marshal with Venom Jump
[4:20:07] <jorniev> how would you react to an air combo in real life?
[4:20:08] <geekpatientzero> "ultimate" I get it
[4:20:22] <NireFuster> Did they progress much into the story during these 4 hours or did they mostly do side stuff?
[4:20:31] <NireFuster> Cuz I missed like 3 hours of stream LUL
[4:20:37] <brachydios777> Is there a costume after these training challenges?
[4:20:41] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @jorniev seeing it? mark out. the target of one? mark out but in pain.
[4:20:48] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @brachydios777 of course
[4:20:49] <%Shad0wTag> @nirefuster Bit of both
[4:20:49] <+MegaQuint> @brachydios777 There is
[4:20:55] <brachydios777> Nice
[4:20:55] <HyperSonicX99> That was Chinatown
[4:20:57] <Potatoidea> @jorniev I would go "WHOA" and record it for YouTube
[4:21:02] <brachydios777> What costume?
[4:21:12] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Chinatown Faire is also /technically/ in this game
[4:21:13] <%ShinobiPhoenix> if we say, Woolie mightsee it
[4:21:26] <%ShinobiPhoenix> just google it
[4:21:43] <brachydios777> I‚Äôll sush then, my bad
[4:22:06] <brachydios777> *shush
[4:22:11] <%mr_sups> He sounds like he has a cold
[4:22:22] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I don't even have Miles installed to check myself now, i reinstalled Spider-Man RM
[4:22:47] <%ShinobiPhoenix> just because of No Way Home, and Spider-Man RM added Raimi and Amazing Suit
[4:22:54] <%mr_sups> Are we the baddies?
[4:23:07] <%baka_sugoi> BET
[4:23:09] <+Jiggisnipe> it closed down in 2011 tho?
[4:23:15] <%mr_sups> Miles can go an air-combo some fuckers on teh caps
[4:23:17] <%mr_sups> Cabs
[4:23:48] <%ShinobiPhoenix> so... straight up, has Woolie does ANY Wall or Ceiling take downs? t that trophy is very much not one you can do by accident
[4:23:48] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1483311049713635328?s=20
[4:24:00] <+ReallyBigRocks> was that Spider-Man? where could he possibly have gone?
[4:24:02] <FrostedZaibatsu> Why is it only look out for Spider-Man. He's not the only hero right
[4:24:16] <VincentGraves> an invisible spider, terrifying
[4:24:27] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @FrostedZaibatsu they feel like they aren't a Avengers problem
[4:24:30] <%atlasdotwav> Must've been the wind
[4:24:46] <NireFuster> I like that enemies remain alerted once they notice something and don't go ''huh must've been the wind''
[4:24:57] <%Juriasu> Hey
[4:24:59] <ErikFeral> mmmm... lemonde powered cars....
[4:25:13] <%ShinobiPhoenix> and we don't hear about Daredevil or Luke around these games, hell, i wonder if Wolverine takes places in the same universe as this SpiderMan
[4:25:18] <NireFuster> That guy is DEAD
[4:25:23] <Pookiedaexzile> Remember Kids taking collective action againist pollution is wrong. Be a lone gunman like spiderman
[4:25:23] <NireFuster> There's no way that guy survived that
[4:25:50] <%ShinobiPhoenix> THOSE guys are the reason you NEED the Wall ROcket
[4:26:01] <+PapaGravestone> the natural enemy of the spider is the shield
[4:26:13] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Slide UNDER teh shield
[4:26:18] <NireFuster> Oof nice dodge!!
[4:26:22] <+ReallyBigRocks> "capture him" says the man with the rocket launcher
[4:26:29] <%ShinobiPhoenix> or do the hop jump off the shield
[4:26:34] <slackerunchained> Use the Axe sub-weapon to chop it in half! :O
[4:26:35] <ErikFeral> square and circle, woolie
[4:26:38] <NireFuster> Take out the other enemies first??
[4:26:45] <NireFuster> Might be easier without like 20 guys shooting you
[4:26:52] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Square Circle or Square Cross
[4:26:54] <Aussie_Manny> GRAVITY SQUEEZE
[4:27:00] <Qsmash_> I like the hectic moments in this game. Feels like a real beat em up.
[4:27:01] <%ShinobiPhoenix> jump the shield or slide under it
[4:27:19] <NireFuster> Not even giving two shits LUL
[4:27:25] <NireFuster> Just a regular thursday at the office
[4:27:31] <stevenellis386> like a good scientist, he dont want none
[4:27:34] <lotharrio> It's Roxxon. Sick-ass super battles happen all the time there.
[4:27:43] <NireFuster> oh shit spanish lines? PogChamp
[4:27:44] <%ShinobiPhoenix> ok, now I feel like replaying this on Hard Mode
[4:27:49] <+deathygz> if this was a marvel movie wed be seeing the fight from silence in his perspective
[4:28:00] <Aussie_Manny> Game's deceptively tough sometimes.
[4:28:28] <NireFuster> Yeah that entire section looked pretty rough
[4:28:29] <Aussie_Manny> doodMash
[4:28:29] <ErikFeral> aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
[4:28:31] <NireFuster> As in, super hard
[4:28:32] <kazadaz> There is this dude who completes these rooms without ever touching the ground

[4:28:38] <Aussie_Manny> How's Woolie's hand? lol
[4:28:46] <jorniev> IN FAMOUUUUUS
[4:28:55] <NireFuster> How did that not cause all organs in Miles' body to just, shut down?
[4:28:59] <slackerunchained> You know what you doing. Take off every Zig!
[4:29:13] <ErikFeral> @NireFuster radioactive spider blood
[4:29:13] <NireFuster> LUL QA powers activate
[4:29:14] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I changed tap to hold, all these tap QTE bs in games, I am done with all of it, waste of time
[4:29:20] <Madinki> Miles defiantly has super cancer after all that.
[4:29:20] <Aussie_Manny> Maybe the spider that bit Miles fell into a tank of modified electric eels.
[4:29:28] <%atlasdotwav> Someone set up us the bomb
[4:29:30] <%ZweihanderSteve> SWAG
[4:29:32] <Aussie_Manny> Shut up, Bezos.
[4:29:36] <NireFuster> I guess the spider that bit him is just super resistant to electricity, yeah
[4:29:39] <Aussie_Manny> He killed a man.

[4:35:46] <ErikFeral> JJ interviews the De-Webbing Crew
[4:35:47] <%kyh9> The NYPD would just let them die

[4:35:52] <Daxalog> Some cops think the webs are kinda gross
[4:35:53] <+samuraiknack> Damage Control
[4:35:54] <Steel_Masquerade> i feel like theres been a comic scene at least
[4:35:56] <niffinbox> does damage control ever do it?
[4:35:57] <slackerunchained> They've actually reverse-engineered it!
[4:35:59] <+TheMilkiestShake> There has to be web insurance for buildings
[4:35:59] <NireFuster> Imagine all the people who are chilling on their house and suddenly they receive like a web on their window from Spidey swinging
[4:36:02] <KeiganOfAstora> Solvent
[4:36:03] <%emptyantics> Damage control
[4:36:03] <%kyh9> This would be FDNY, not NYPD
[4:36:05] <%mr_sups> There's a New York wide version of that.
[4:36:07] <Aussie_Manny> The Spider-Man clean up crew is called Nam-Redips, run by Skullface.

[4:36:12] <@Menitta> we know the specific isopropyl alcohol to use
[4:36:14] <SaiyanShoto> Peter usually goes and checks on the people he webbed up
[4:36:16] <enerkaizer> normally spidey hangs them up in regular reach height
[4:36:18] <%Prevot> just let them fall
[4:36:18] <jorniev> there's a sto falling to his death when the the web fluid ran out of time and Peter just saves him at the last minute and Webster again because there's a fire
[4:36:20] <Dante_Namikaze1> It's Damage Control
[4:36:24] <%Prevot> spider-man did his part

[4:37:07] <NireFuster> To be fair this only happens in the game, Peter always webs them up on the street LUL
[4:37:13] <slackerunchained> This reminds me of the Human Torch villain "Asbestos Man"
[4:37:14] <Steel_Masquerade> it was suspect in the previous game
[4:37:15] <SaiyanShoto> What‚Äôs funny is the sub Reddit posted a comic panel about this recently
