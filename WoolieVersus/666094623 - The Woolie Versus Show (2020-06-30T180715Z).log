[0:01:56] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> emulation? :)
[0:02:00] <Syrushmx> woolie, If you grab ingredients, try to keep them for when you have the ability to use them
[0:02:05] <%FuqBoiSlim> emulation??? the hell is he talking about
[0:02:05] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:02:07] <Shwepie> How would emus interfere with timing?

[0:02:07] <Run44forrest> @woolieversus theres an item that doubles your inventory space in the bloody palace floor 40 do with this information what you will

[0:02:50] <+ToastyMozart> On the other hand the N64 version doesn't have the timing issue and PJ64 is a kludged-together programming disaster. But yeah check the prefetch custom textures box.
[0:02:54] <Mczutioni> I played with the HD "Button" and didnt have any of that. Check if the Prefetch Custom Textures box in the graphical settings is ticked

[0:03:10] <%HitchhikingThrough> @WoolieVersus hey woolie, did a playthrough with the HD switch, the audio crunch only happens during the pipe/paper effects. Might just be worth sticking with it for now.
[0:03:10] <Solidnick18> hmmmmmmmm

[0:04:48] <+KilogramHours> Thats fine
[0:04:51] <niozonbi> gimme dat cronch
[0:04:51] <%HitchhikingThrough> @Lazyjoules it'll only happen once or twice during transitions
[0:04:52] <nyacoo> Tbh the game looks gorgeous just running at a higher internal resolution, you don't really need the retexture mod

[0:04:58] <+nocturne_reverie> the crunch was an area loading screen thing i think

[0:05:13] <axelkaspar> Let's be Druckmann
[0:05:16] <%SirGO0SE> mmm gotta get cronchy
[0:05:18] <%Proxzo> Cronch will be fine if you're doing a cleanup stream I think.
[0:05:19] <%BisoromiBear> I can't believe Woolie is pro-crunch.
[0:05:19] <TheMrRental> i want my nuggets extra crispy today, mom
[0:05:20] <NiktenKing> So Pat was right when he said he would have to wait 6months to play it after you guys...
[0:05:20] <%SirGO0SE> gotta get cronchy in here

[0:05:24] <%Ancopro> do worry guys it'll be fixed in the bluray
[0:05:24] <axelkaspar> Let's do some crunches
[0:05:25] <exnuart> it'll probably only get real crispy when loading new tile sets
[0:05:27] <rubbishbinge> sprinkling some panko all over paper mario

[0:07:32] <CrimsonGargoyle> @HitchhikingThrough LUL
[0:07:33] <+Cavumentum> Go back to AA rather than AAA
[0:07:34] <Zebroneath> We shouldnt need blood sacrifices
[0:07:34] <TheMrRental> but we need 10 hours of abby :(
[0:07:35] <+UberWolfman> BUT MUH 60 DOLARS
[0:07:36] <@Solidus_113> But then AAA games won't exist! /s
[0:07:36] <%StarMechV> AA games need to go back into the spotlight
[0:07:36] <+jiggy_snipe> its a problem with the tech industry
[0:07:42] <LoneFonte> but we totally need 80 voiced subquests
[0:07:42] <%Creggamonsta> makes games shorter and drop the price
[0:07:45] <+EdenOfLove> How bout increasing dev time and keeping the games as big as they are?
[0:07:45] <+ckangaroo15k> eskittit
[0:07:45] <+greenfall> just dont buy AAA games
[0:07:46] <$BallerSwagBro9k> BUt mUh GAmEs ThO
[0:07:48] <%CommanderSqueaks> Most people don't even beat the game once, short adventures are fine.
[0:07:48] <+nocturne_reverie> i'd rather have a game with a heart every so often over a bunch of schlock every week
[0:07:48] <%Creggamonsta> i could live withthat
[0:07:50] <%FuqBoiSlim> Just stick to the AA and indies like I do KappaPride
[0:07:57] <%RadicalWeegee> yes
[0:08:00] <+Dr_DangerPhD> If every game were less than or around 8-10 hours I'd buy way more games
[0:08:00] <%Chatterbox1991> does Nintendo crunch?
[0:08:05] <%Proxzo> We do no crunch at work, it just means a longer dev time and cut features. And think that's fine. A lot of games have feature bloat anyways.
[0:08:06] <Infinit_Phoenix> dont make games longer just make them worth replaying
[0:08:07] <%gliph13> Don't support Crunch, but i would like some more content for my 60$
[0:08:10] <+Graem> AA games need to be higher quality tbbh then with a few hits and attention, they'll be back in
[0:08:11] <edward11231> But the spoiled community though
[0:08:17] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Long games have their merit, like Xenoblade that I'm playing right now, but that's a very specific case. The AAA bloat is real.
[0:08:17] <Run44forrest> sounds fine
[0:08:19] <%FuqBoiSlim> the last game I paid $60 for was Astral Chain last year
[0:08:20] <RoboGira> how far is he in the gamae

[0:15:52] <%SirGO0SE> Piccolo disagrees
[0:15:52] <thetntm> it doesn't reduce movement speed just makes it so you can't run from battles
[0:15:53] <LoneFonte> BUT*
[0:15:54] <rubbishbinge> Slow Run tech
[0:15:55] <Shwepie> Weighted clothing, Woolie!

[0:16:17] <niozonbi> life shroom in storage
[0:16:18] <%gliph13> It's for walking on thin paths.
[0:16:20] <%Ancopro> oh does it not affect overworld speed
[0:16:21] <%FuqBoiSlim> If you wear that badge for long enough, the next time you take it off you become 3x powerful like rock lee
[0:16:22] <GenericSoda> it's leftovers from paper mario 64 because of a single room
[0:16:23] <%RadicalWeegee> Its if you have a broken controller and you cant sneak past enemies
[0:16:23] <+hatok> the slow badge is basically for parts of the game where you're supposed to move slowly to sneak past, it was more of a thing in Paper Mario 64 though
[0:16:24] <Davybot> It’s so you can’t run from battle
[0:16:24] <+Graem> Slow is fun when powerful, not when weak.
[0:16:27] <Shwepie> @WoolieVersus As someone already said it means can't run from battle.
[0:16:28] <+Juriasu> SourPls
[0:16:28] <%HitchhikingThrough> @WoolieVersus IT USES RECIPIES
[0:16:32] <%HitchhikingThrough> ITS NOT RNG

[0:17:03] <%KyoryUtchy> It's not RNG
[0:17:06] <+Lazyjoules> cooking is NOT rng
[0:17:07] <Papa_Bearman> It's still an upgrade - Dried Shroom recovers 1 HP, MIstake recovers 1 HP and 1 FP.
[0:17:09] <KatabolicRage> still an improvement, but as peoplel are sayting you have to find specific recipes
[0:17:09] <%FuqBoiSlim> ITS FAWKING RAAAAAW
[0:17:16] <+EdenOfLove> Check your storage in the item shop for a life shroom
[0:17:18] <niozonbi> mistake is better than dry shroom

[0:54:30] <+KilogramHours> ITS HALF WAY
[0:54:31] <%Th3SmartAlec> 20 levels
[0:54:31] <%MonsterEnvy> Not the whole thing
[0:54:32] <@akuda_bar> it wants you to go halfway
[0:54:32] <+yamask3312> he doesnt need to clear it yea
[0:54:32] <+ckangaroo15k> Not all of them.
[0:54:32] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> 18 lvls
[0:54:34] <Run44forrest> @woolieversus STOCK UP ON HEALS
[0:54:35] <SixthSun2> It's not the whole bloody palace
[0:54:35] <DragonArt07> you need cake mix later
[0:54:35] <Armaxin13> 20 floors
[0:54:35] <skyheys> it's a sneak peak
[0:54:35] <+GreenCMD> only a section
[0:54:36] <Louie_Salmon> Not all of it, but a fair bit
[0:54:37] <+pectusumbra> yeah, a few levels
[0:54:37] <el_biribon> you gotta beat the first 20 floors
[0:54:38] <+TheOneCalledRock> 20 levels
[0:54:39] <Drusain> First 18 floors
[0:54:39] <+Dimfish> its a few levels according to chat
[0:54:40] <%LuckyLagomorph> @WoolieVersus It's not the whole thing
[0:54:40] <%MonsterEnvy> Just a couple of levels
[0:54:40] <Mczutioni> 18 Levels
[0:54:41] <+botchdogg> 20 floors
[0:54:41] <nyacoo> Only a couple of levels
[0:54:41] <+Grayhammatter> it's to floor 20
[0:54:41] <niozonbi> Kappa Yeah
[0:54:42] <rubbishbinge> Yes
[0:54:42] <%Th3SmartAlec> correct
[0:54:42] <+KilogramHours> 20 floors
[0:54:42] <missingangle> It's still A LOT
[0:54:43] <Papa_Bearman> You're only doing 20% of the Pit for this quest.
[0:54:43] <%KyoryUtchy> 20 floors
[0:54:44] <Bguy32> Its 20 levels
[0:54:45] <+axamilli> 20 floors
[0:54:47] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> 20
[0:54:48] <$Superdandy96> Time to go to Rougeport’s dungeon of hell
[0:54:48] <kulmoth> about 20 floors
[0:54:49] <%Proxzo> He can buy more mix if he wants, let him cook it
[0:54:49] <Zeemod155> You only have to do thid first 10/20 floors then you can get off immediately
[0:54:50] <%chosenjuan42> just 20 levels
[0:54:50] <andrex2311> 20 floors
[0:54:51] <%RadicalWeegee> 20 floors
[0:54:51] <%GrassCannon> Make the eight, Woolio
[0:54:51] <+marumariball> you could save this one
[0:54:52] <Irkallu> I forgot about this part. I don't remember the first 20 levels being too bad, though
[0:54:54] <benbag13> 20 floor
[0:54:55] <+yamask3312> at the stage they are at they can get down to 20 with good action guard commands
[0:54:58] <TheLemuroid> I would leave it
[0:54:58] <%lewdskeletor13> It’s gonna take awhile
[0:54:59] <$tkuwari> its like a quarter of it
[0:55:02] <missingangle> I would recommend to just WAIT
[0:55:04] <benbag13> 20 level
[0:55:05] <%SirGO0SE> SourPls
[0:55:05] <%BisoromiBear> EZPZ
[0:55:07] <+KilogramHours> A floor is a battle
[0:55:08] <exnuart> 20 floors, 50 for expanded inventory
[0:55:08] <Papa_Bearman> You'll see.
[0:55:09] <GenericSoda> i would wait on it
[0:55:09] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> 1 battle
[0:55:10] <Solidnick18> SourPls
[0:55:11] <el_biribon> 1 floor = 1 battle
[0:55:12] <+Zenryoku21> I think part 3 would be more hype
[0:55:13] <Darren716> I'd say just wait or off screen it
[0:55:13] <+KilogramHours> @WoolieVersus One floor is 1 battle
[0:55:14] <bumpbox911> cake mix is later i think im not shure
[0:55:15] <%ividboy> a floor is one battle
[0:55:16] <%Jetzord> each floor is a battle
[0:55:20] <%CommanderSqueaks> 1 Floor = 1 Battle
[0:55:26] <the_saltiest> worth it to wait until you can do a longer dip tbh!
[0:55:26] <Bguy32> Just do it later
[0:55:29] <+ikasukiz> moose
[0:55:29] <slimey0> it's your first playthrough, do it next chapter
[0:55:29] <SixthSun2> You get an exit every 10th floor, so you can do that to take a dip
[0:55:30] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> do it later
[0:55:30] <%SomersaultJustice> delicious moose
[0:55:31] <+yamask3312> also you can get 20 item spaces with the item u get on like floor 40 of 50
[0:55:31] <Run44forrest> @exnuart pretty sure you get the sack at 40
[0:55:31] <$tkuwari> Honestly it can wait, you'll be stronger later
[0:55:32] <%Th3SmartAlec> Moose LUL
[0:55:36] <+marumariball> yeah its a good idea to wait on it to be honest
[0:55:36] <bumpbox911> ok nvm i thought you mis it later
[0:55:38] <MrGameNJosh> Wait to do it
[0:55:39] <%GrassCannon> The Canadian specialty
[0:55:40] <$Superdandy96> Hope you got your guard timing down
[0:55:46] <Papa_Bearman> You're probably gonna want items for the Pit.
[0:55:50] <%Th3SmartAlec> and now to never use it
[0:55:53] <TheLemuroid> The pit might overlevel you
[0:56:00] <TheMrRental> they don't need to wait chapter 3 will happen eventually
[0:56:04] <Darren716> Just wait so you can burn through the early parts of the pit
[0:56:13] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> wait on the pit
[0:56:14] <TheMrRental> He might want to grab more hp soon, though :)

[3:20:57] <%krispen_wa> Woolie got OUT
[3:20:57] <%Asuterisuku> Woolie got in and got out.
[3:21:01] <%ozmon> That was an incredible back out
[3:21:06] <%ozmon> So far.
[3:21:08] <%Superbro64> GET OUT OF GAMBLING
[3:21:13] <OneThousandTomatoes> but sometimes you don't reach that goal
[3:21:20] <%JustYudha> Great recover
[3:21:21] <%SirGO0SE> is it even gambling? Kappa
[3:21:25] <%Mczutioni> Woolie learned a lot in his life, backing out one of them!
[3:21:26] <glass_marcus> it's not gambling if it works out
[3:21:46] <%ividboy> but how long would you have gone if you weren't getting there
[3:21:48] <+terry_quest> but you could always have more
[3:21:49] <+jiggy_snipe> what, fans creating false narratives... never Kappa
[3:21:49] <Victory_Boss> But you considered it
[3:21:49] <%Superbro64> responsible adult woolie PogChamp
[3:21:50] <Drusain> But you made innocent Reggie play
[3:21:56] <%krispen_wa> You had to pay 15 coins tho
[3:22:04] <+netrac> Woolie will start next session with 999 chips
[3:22:08] <OneThousandTomatoes> budget
[3:22:24] <the1ax2man3> No
[3:22:24] <%prime_name> Agreed
[3:22:26] <OneThousandTomatoes> no
[3:22:27] <%SomersaultJustice> no

[3:22:30] <Rhinoprotoss> No
[3:22:32] <%SuperKirby24> no
[3:22:33] <+VorpalSlash> no
[3:22:33] <%gatorafan> What a Vanilla ass taste
[3:22:35] <%sunnythedrunk> In terms of anime

[3:22:51] <%Mczutioni> LEOMON
[3:22:53] <+ZoltanBMagnus> but what about GUNDRAMON!
[3:22:57] <+Blurry15> it wasn't even a competition
[3:22:58] <the1ax2man3> I hard disagree
[3:23:02] <%DatAsuna> Lady Devimon is goals
[3:23:03] <%Ecchigun> agumon pog

[3:23:13] <powerprotoman> so clearly we need reggie to experience cyber sleuth
[3:23:23] <%prime_name> Cool Buddist text on his jacket too.

[3:24:48] <missingangle> Oh yeah!
[3:24:51] <%Superbro64> BOMBA PogChamp
[3:24:53] <dreamcastiszombie> LUL
[3:24:56] <NotHereToStream> tourney arcs are always great
[3:24:56] <Dragonpit1234> man I missed the stream, well the vod will be good
[3:24:56] <%Mczutioni> BOMBA LUIGI
[3:24:57] <%Proxzo> in Japan, Rawk Hawk is called Hawk Hogan
[3:24:57] <+AbnormalVoid> yeyeye
[3:25:06] <+xerotwo> SPACE AND WRASSLIN
[3:25:12] <Dragonpit1234> and yeah chapter 2 is my least favorite personally
[3:25:21] <%Proxzo> Nice stream
[3:25:28] <+jiggy_snipe> Gonzalez is funny cuz Vince would do something like that with an Italian playing a Latino
[3:25:30] <roguemephilesclone> Hey Woolie, do you like Pikmin?
[3:25:33] <pmtriox> always keep tabs on luigi when he's off camera, he gets up crazy adventures
[3:25:44] <%Superbro64> JOHN HALO
[3:25:44] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:25:45] <%Asuterisuku> Chapter gets better, Woolie!
[3:25:51] <TheLemuroid> I think this was the first time they weren't bodied by Paper Mario
[3:26:03] <%prime_name> Ah, darn.
[3:26:10] <%DensityD> that's too bad, I love that content
[3:26:13] <%HitchhikingThrough> Yeah that tracks, I was impressed with how well it was done
[3:26:15] <%Asuterisuku> RIP OVA.
[3:26:20] <+JingKaisean> split screen is fine
[3:26:22] <%RadicalWeegee> oh noooo ;n; dang
[3:26:26] <%krispen_wa> So the Manga is now superior again
[3:26:36] <TheLemuroid> That works
[3:26:39] <%HitchhikingThrough> There's a reason groups like Yogscast and RoosterTeeth have multiple editors, that shit is rough.
[3:26:39] <%Superbro64> editing is hard
[3:26:40] <%DatAsuna> fake splitscreen
[3:26:41] <+jiggy_snipe> nope
[3:26:48] <%DatAsuna> Manga is only half the footage
[3:26:48] <%RadicalWeegee> oh thats cool too
[3:26:49] <+jiggy_snipe> we still cant see V's screen
[3:26:54] <@akuda_bar> krispen_wa... that name...
[3:26:57] <%Irridium> xbone is always there. waiting
[3:27:09] <%HitchhikingThrough> @akuda_bar it's the gift that keeps on giving
[3:27:22] <@akuda_bar> i was like "huh..? oh shit"
[3:27:25] <%DatAsuna> That's why you offset
[3:27:27] <%Asuterisuku> Xbone doesn't have couch coop either.
[3:27:30] <%SirGO0SE> pip's alright
[3:27:31] <TheLemuroid> Woolie as primary with V as a popup
[3:27:34] <pi_in_the_sci> RE5 split-screen
[3:27:39] <CyrusVGZ> Picture-in-Picture should look fine.
[3:27:58] <%Asuterisuku> Lots of places in Halo 1's UI to not cover things up.
[3:28:02] <%Superbro64> worse come to worse, I dont think one sole perspective is the end of the world
[3:28:03] <%RadicalWeegee> new experiences!

[3:35:36] <+Estuko> @travie_64 this is Woolie's outro, and this current scene is the opening to the game Namco X Capcom
[3:35:45] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> is that fucking Klonoa?

[3:36:40] <%krispen_wa> Who animated this OP?
[3:36:44] <+travie_64> Trigger

[3:38:05] <%Asuterisuku> Capcom was only very briefly not anime.
[3:38:16] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> And so the Woolie, his job complete, lies down again to rest in his trash cocoon

[3:38:41] <CyrusVGZ> What? Inafune's time at Capcom was when they were peak anime. Fuck are you on?
[3:38:56] <SuperiorXIII> off to go eat trashed potatoes
[3:38:57] <+ConLin_Arts_> ooooh it was Production I.G
[3:39:10] <%Asuterisuku> Are you trying to say that DmC is less anime than the series it was based on?
[3:39:50] <%Asuterisuku> ... Ahem. I typed that out wrong.
[3:39:50] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:40:00] <CyrusVGZ> Capcom's most "anime" series came out with Inafune was producer. You're focusing on the western era and ignoring everything that came before it.
[3:40:02] <%chase959> what happened to stream? I heard opening and left for a smoke
[3:40:08] <%chase959> now black screen
[3:40:42] <%Asuterisuku> You heard closing, not opening.
