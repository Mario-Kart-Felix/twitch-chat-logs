[0:00:00] <oda_flobunaga> @hax_metatron why would SHE be the voice of just Revachol, and not simply the voice which for everything/ inland Empire?

[0:02:16] <servicesuspension> you can't just bring newcomers with sharingan
[0:02:20] <+MightyDuckShoes> man Twitch should have a Spoiler chatfeed tab. it will be the VIP room for all the High Culture snobs.
[0:02:39] <%jinking79> Thanks God for Kano

[0:02:51] <brachydios777> Kano carries that movie
[0:02:54] <khalcatto> oh no my mortal kombat spoilers
[0:03:07] <%Juriasu> I don't think hoolywood allows you to even consider making a movie unless it ends with some sort of backdoor to a sequel or entire cinematic universe
[0:03:09] <%UnbreakableDoof> He wants to be wiggling those eyebrows in hollywood
[0:03:10] <servicesuspension> Cole Young, my favorite MK fighter
[0:03:12] <+MightyDuckShoes> Kano put the team on his back
[0:03:17] <%gitgouda> ^
[0:03:19] <+CateHecate> i love that after talking to measurehead even if you dont internalize his thought, your character almost always refers to alcohol as "al gul" and it even comes up later when someone ELSE calls it that
[0:03:32] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[0:03:32] <%gitgouda> @MightyDuckShoes you mean movie he put the movie on his back
[0:03:36] <Parapattern> EWWWWW
[0:03:38] <@Solidus_113> Live MK vs DC
[0:03:41] <%illtima> fuck off no never
[0:03:43] <+MightyDuckShoes> I can't believe they teased a sequel with Johnny Cage of all people
[0:03:45] <brachydios777> Oh god
[0:03:47] <%thetunnelhomer> So Cole is not Kuai Liang I imagine?
[0:03:48] <andre11dr> Everyone wants a CU today instead of making an actual story that finishes in a satisfying way

[0:03:55] <+undeadarchitect> You hear the hollow sound of the batman theme
[0:03:57] <aiutare47> it did!?!
[0:04:00] <%thetunnelhomer> Haven't seen the movie
[0:04:02] <%cache_22> Give us the Snyder Cut MK movie. Kappa
[0:04:09] <servicesuspension> Hey remember when they promised an animated cinematic universe between Devil May Cry and Castlevania?
[0:04:14] <%nicversus> Where's the lie tho
[0:04:14] <brachydios777> Not wrong
[0:04:17] <Chatterbox1991> Litterally Scorpian s in Injustice 1 @WoolieVersus
[0:04:18] <Solidnick18> that is true
[0:04:31] <%nicversus> and the Snyderverse is pretty much Injustice
[0:04:36] <Solidnick18> oof
[0:04:37] <mr_sups> I unironically want to see that
[0:04:38] <%jinking79> god no
[0:04:40] <+Jiggisnipe> How many MK characters have been in Injustice?
[0:04:41] <servicesuspension> Injustice also continues to be ugly
[0:04:42] <brachydios777> Raiden and Subzero is in Injustice 2
[0:04:43] <%30kfiery> hello
[0:04:45] <@Solidus_113> I'm about to pop my rage meter
[0:04:45] <andre11dr> Well ,Injustice 2 had a lot of crossover shit ,not just MK ,but yeah
[0:04:48] <redgiant795> oof üò¨
[0:04:49] <%30kfiery> I created twitch account just to ask this question, you might be my long lost twin brother, do you know anyone from Florida @WoolieVersus
[0:04:50] <oda_flobunaga> Why not MK vs Smash, that would be so sick
[0:04:50] <+MightyDuckShoes> i don't want slow motion, depressing and ponderous MK
[0:04:54] <Chatterbox1991> Can we just get Zack Snyder as a fighting game character?
[0:04:54] <+eanscrale> oh god, it will so up it's own ass
[0:04:59] <%jinking79> i don't want 4 hour movie again woolieSPICE
[0:05:02] <servicesuspension> Funko Pops The Movie... again
[0:05:04] <%thetunnelhomer> I would love to see a Snyder MK movie muted.
[0:05:16] <CappuccinoGuil> Remember the Eragon movie?
[0:05:22] <redgiant795> no more snyder
[0:05:31] <servicesuspension> Fantastic Beasts 2 was GODAWFUL
[0:05:31] <aiutare47> @CappuccinoGuil Every night when I close my eyes
[0:05:31] <%kyh9> It‚Äôs all just Star Wars
[0:05:35] <andre11dr> Well LOTR at least was just 3 movies that where good
[0:05:37] <+ALazo> Please let's not talk about the Eragon movie.
[0:05:40] <@Menitta> it was p fun
[0:05:41] <%kyh9> Star Wars was the start of this franchise shit
[0:05:45] <%thetunnelhomer> People keep telling me the Inheritance Cycle is good and I refuse to believe them.
[0:05:48] <andre11dr> Instead of 30 dumb movies
[0:05:50] <%cache_22> Remember there was a Monster Hunter movie?
[0:05:56] <trickster721> Zack Snyder would be too OP as a fighting game character, he would just explain his objectivist worldview and his opponent's head would explode
[0:06:01] <%jinking79> man wish the Soundtrack was better
[0:06:02] <+Yopomo> oh hot take, I loved it. so dumb and fun, the fight scenes were fun
[0:06:03] <%kyh9> It‚Äôs all Star Wars fault
[0:06:06] <CappuccinoGuil> @aiutare47 I literally forgot I watched it. I rewatched it years later because the content of the movie was wiped from my memory
[0:06:06] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:06:12] <@Solidus_113> If you're not a MK fan the movie is almost unwatchably bad.
[0:06:16] <grub> T O T A L I T Y
[0:06:17] <+CateHecate> TOTALITY
[0:06:18] <+Yopomo> that is true
[0:06:24] <aiutare47> @thetunnelhomer Its great if youre young, I loved it in middle school
[0:06:25] <@Menitta> Kano STOLE THAT MOVIE
[0:06:31] <+CateHecate> i studied all your moves
[0:06:33] <Nohorse> Ye ye ye I couldn't wait for more DISCO PogChamp
[0:06:44] <user_naim> I STUDIED ALL YOUR MOVIES, SNYDER
[0:06:44] <%kyh9> Isn‚Äôt Kano just Kuben Blisk?
[0:06:47] <andre11dr> What we learned today is that we need to just let storys in media FUCKING END
[0:06:48] <%JaseAdrift> He was the most interesting part of the movie
[0:06:50] <%Lion_kun> He also had a bad time with a garden gnome.
[0:06:51] <%thetunnelhomer> Kano is Disco Cop like 20 years younger
[0:06:59] <%JaseAdrift> Id rather watch a movie of Kano and Kabal fucking around
[0:07:03] <%illtima> Kano stole the movie and Shinnok's amulet
[0:07:12] <+OblivionSword1> Kuben Blisk is South African
[0:07:15] <%Seancicle> cherish it
[0:07:18] <+undeadarchitect> Aww yes. Evil Rapey guy is our glue for this movie.
[0:07:22] <+CateHecate> what if we made Cuno a mortal kombat character, except he would be Kuno
[0:07:22] <brachydios777> Kano is the prime minster of prison planet
[0:07:23] <Darren716> I think it really started with Avengers 1
[0:07:31] <@Menitta> When you look back on stuff like Captain America The First Avenger, it didn't have a lot of comedy
[0:07:32] <%Lion_kun> Kano and Kabal were the best characters and deserved better.
[0:07:33] <servicesuspension> That kinda kills superhero movies for me. They're all so quippy
[0:07:37] <%kewlmyc> Fucking quips
[0:07:52] <%Seancicle> make a decision
[0:07:57] <LegitBarnacleBoy> !uptime
[0:07:57] <@Moobot> @LegitBarnacleBoy WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 21 minutes and 35 seconds
[0:08:00] <user_naim> Man I still like quips
[0:08:04] <user_naim> quip it up
[0:08:11] <@Menitta> That's true, it does make it imbalanced
[0:08:11] <%nicversus> @Darren716 agreed, Whedon ruined the tone of the whole MCU. At least GotG had genuine emotion to balance the comedy
[0:08:12] <CappuccinoGuil> @thetunnelhomer The books are fun. The main baddie is built up really well throughout the books and the magic system lends itself to a lot of fun theorizing. That's about it LUL
[0:08:16] <servicesuspension> I just remembered those screenshots about the movie Stalker if it was directed by Joss Whedon... PAIN
[0:08:32] <andre11dr> It's a very, Kenny type of movie
[0:08:35] <Nohorse> Kano but instead he's replaced by Cuno
[0:08:40] <%JaseAdrift> Kenny will like it...maybe
[0:08:43] <andre11dr> Fuckin no
[0:08:46] <+DragonArt07> @WoolieVersus how awesome was that Yasuke trailer?
[0:08:49] <@Solidus_113> I still haven't seen DBE
[0:08:52] <@Menitta> oh god
[0:08:52] <%Seancicle> je connais OSFrog

[0:08:57] <+krispen_wa> oh god
[0:08:58] <servicesuspension> that is NOT a high bar
[0:08:58] <aiutare47> Do you?
[0:08:59] <Indigo_Automaton> NO YOU DON'T
[0:09:00] <Parapattern> You REALLY don't
[0:09:01] <%andrewofbob> When does Hollywood ruin BlazBlue?
[0:09:02] <%jinking79> THE KOF LIVE ACTION MOVIE NEVER REMEMBER IT
[0:09:04] <Nohorse> KANO DOESN'T FUCKING CARE
[0:09:04] <%cache_22> I wish Dragonball: Evolution was on Amazon Prime for a watch party.
[0:09:05] <Ids560> it's pretty bad
[0:09:07] <andre11dr> I'll watch that Mother's Basement video instead
[0:09:07] <Darren716> Woolie don't
[0:09:11] <+Ropcord> i saw that shit in theaters FeelsBadMan
[0:09:13] <user_naim> NO
[0:09:13] <%Lion_kun> It's boring
[0:09:14] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @servicesuspension
[0:09:20] <Chatterbox1991> That first Tekkan is alright
[0:09:20] <Indigo_Automaton> There's only heartbreak
[0:09:20] <%kyh9> Did you ever finish Korea?
[0:09:24] <user_naim> Woolie don‚Äôt
[0:09:27] <servicesuspension> The Kof movie had great choreography
[0:09:28] <aiutare47> I saw that shit right after it came out and I was just confused
[0:09:28] <%Lion_kun> KOF?
[0:09:29] <%JaseAdrift> not worth it
[0:09:30] <Darren716> Blood Vengence?
[0:09:33] <%kyh9> What‚Äôs the state of Woolie Vs Korra
[0:09:39] <%Juriasu> what????
[0:09:39] <@Menitta> the KOF movie is a blight
[0:09:41] <servicesuspension> Also Terry Bogard was an FBI agent
[0:09:43] <Solidnick18> oh wow
[0:09:46] <%Seancicle> ‚¨áÔ∏è‚ÜôÔ∏è‚¨ÖÔ∏èüÖ±Ô∏è
[0:09:47] <benupde287> its pretty bad, but doesn't shoot the moon to "The Room" levels of entertaining
[0:09:49] <Darren716> KoF is a travesty
[0:09:50] <+KeySosa54> The Last Airbender is just sad
[0:09:50] <Solidnick18> i've seen tekken
[0:09:51] <%nicversus> Woolie watch it, know our suffering
[0:09:53] <%gatorafan> I... never heard of those daedra1DerpyTibs
[0:09:53] <+KeySosa54> so much potential wasted
[0:09:54] <servicesuspension> And Kyo Kusanagi is white
[0:09:58] <%andrewofbob> You gave every one a fair chance
[0:09:59] <Solidnick18> and the second one
[0:10:06] <Darren716> How do you make Terry Bogard boring?
[0:10:08] <Darren716> Like how
[0:10:14] <%illtima> Tekken movie was so bad
[0:10:18] <+CateHecate> while we're talking bad movies based on nerd stuff, does anyone remember that there was a Jonah Hex movie? and Mastodon did the soundtrack for some reason? LUL
[0:10:21] <nojjod420> the Tekken cgi movie was overall boring but the fight scenes were cool
[0:10:23] <martinhadameme> Double Dragon isn't fighting games but it certainly is a bad arcade game adaptation
[0:10:24] <%nicversus> DoA is an Uwe Bol joint
[0:10:26] <andre11dr> The animated Tekken movie is ASS
[0:10:30] <%SivSarcast> @Darren716 "Hey come on come on!"
[0:10:33] <brachydios777> @servicesuspension And they still called him Kyo Kusanagi?
[0:10:33] <%jinking79> Terry Actor the only one that made a career
[0:10:41] <%30kfiery> I created twitch account just to ask this question, you might be my long lost twin brother, do you know anyone from Florida @WoolieVersus
[0:10:42] <%illtima> wait, live action Tekken was garbage. CG Tekken was garbage, but had amazing fights
[0:10:56] <servicesuspension> @brachydios777 Yes
[0:11:02] <miucsa51> YES
[0:11:05] <Solidnick18> yeah
[0:11:06] <iacus_> *we* are the weird ones?
[0:11:08] <%nicversus> mmm content meat
[0:11:10] <servicesuspension> CHAT'S DRAMA IS TOO HIGH
[0:11:11] <+undeadarchitect> The Tekken lore seems like itd be a bit generic for a movie.
[0:11:18] <+OblivionSword1> It is a bit ironic
[0:11:22] <user_naim> art cop fart cop
[0:11:24] <jorniev> CONCEPTUALIZATION SEMPAI
[0:11:25] <+Dova573> huh?
[0:11:26] <%SuckerPunchSyd> I get it i think
[0:11:30] <%Exiliator> That is not how you said it when he popped up tho
[0:11:31] <laguerrilha> Not because of Pat, more since its a fun quips
[0:11:31] <linSP> I don‚Äôt like conceptualization either
[0:11:31] <SolSwagGuy56> Sure Woolie :)
[0:11:32] <%hax_metatron> Wow, lol. Really, people said that?
[0:11:35] <%gatorafan> I haven't checked any other people streaming this so I wouldn't know daedra1DerpyTibs
[0:11:38] <%nicversus> @WoolieVersus we need a CONTENT emote
[0:11:40] <Indigo_Automaton> There are MANY Non sequiturs across most of the skills
[0:11:43] <%Vextalyst> cheer500 yo woolie ur a nice guy not to throw ur family under the bus so let me throw mine instead. Been eligible for the vaccine for a while but have to do it on the DL just to avoid the mountain of shit for accepting bill gate's microchip. Yknow as opposed to the catual microchip they carry around with them at all times. the struggle is real
[0:11:45] <+Jiggisnipe> CONTENT
[0:11:45] <+DenpaDev> People just like nitpicking woolie
[0:11:46] <bonebagMEL> Inspecting the body drops a fire conceptualization line. Pretty cool.
[0:11:47] <Nohorse> You're not wrong, it's the ARTSY skill LUL
[0:11:47] <andre11dr> Because it's the artsy and hipster stat,and THAT'S YOU WOOLIE
[0:11:47] <brachydios777> @servicesuspension That‚Äôs like a white dude being named Ryo Takahata
[0:11:47] <Picia000123> Conceptualization is "that" kinda guy, you know?
[0:11:49] <Solidnick18> people are weird idk
[0:11:50] <servicesuspension> Conceptualization is a pretentious dickbag
[0:11:52] <%Seancicle> üëãüèªü§üüèª
[0:11:53] <ingman112> It‚Äôs just getting blown out of proportion. Plus the more people dig into it the more woolie‚Äôll dig in, and vice versa
[0:11:55] <%SivSarcast> I'd like to think conceptualization is useful at a 6 or 7 but the game constantly dials it up to 11 out of the water.
[0:11:58] <+MightyDuckShoes> I think it was your premeditated sandbagging of conceptualization during the Measurehead bit
[0:12:00] <DSD24> Not everyone is gonna like each personality
[0:12:04] <grub> The stats all have just fun non sequiturs and it‚Äôs fun to just enjoy them all.
[0:12:06] <Parapattern> Maybe let Woolie experience the game on his own terms?
[0:12:08] <+HotBloodedHero> It's the taste contrast between your own conceptualization and the game's.
[0:12:08] <oda_flobunaga> That is how conceptualization works, your brain feeds you stupid shit, it is a question of how filtered you want to be when you speak
[0:12:11] <jorniev> maybe its because THE SKILLS feel like characters
[0:12:15] <Chatterbox1991> Visual Calculus is a must
[0:12:16] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @krispen_wa
[0:12:20] <+SignScratch> you need higher Esprit De Chat
[0:12:21] <grub> Pick whatever stat you want and you will have fun
[0:12:26] <DSD24> How to STINGER
[0:12:27] <%Lion_kun> I wish I could get a PS5
[0:12:29] <Nohorse> E spirit de corpse
[0:12:35] <neostria> Just wait until Conceptualization lets you be racist in a creative way
[0:12:35] <martinhadameme> conceptualization is required for becoming the best detective possible
[0:12:39] <+CateHecate> i agree with pat though i fucking HATE Drama
[0:12:39] <Picia000123> Savoir Fare is hyper hustler, Rhetoric is a communist, endurance is a Fascist, they are all characters basically
[0:12:41] <linSP> In my head conceptualization is an insufferable starving artist
[0:12:50] <DSD24> Voliton is the good guy
[0:12:53] <Chatterbox1991> @WoolieVersus for the record you can save scum for different results on the checks, ive been doing it.
[0:12:53] <ingman112> High conceptualization is both incredibly imaginative and a pretentious douchebag, which is exactly how creativity can be
[0:12:54] <andre11dr> Like i personally hate Drama, Rhetoric, his opinions fucked me over sometimes
[0:13:01] <+undeadarchitect> lol at chat backseating when the game has 20+ backseats built into the gameplay
[0:13:01] <Nohorse> I kinda wish more skills had a distinct personality
[0:13:02] <brachydios777> Always trust Volition
[0:13:05] <trickster721> Being vaguely sensible on the internet = emotionless robot
[0:13:11] <servicesuspension> high concept makes you an art asshole, Drama is also an asshole but hilarious
[0:13:11] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1386952720297381894?s=19
[0:13:13] <martinhadameme> i think it's funny that woolie's favourite skills are the ones with the least interruptions and the least actual uses
[0:13:18] <Nohorse> Drama is amazing I love him
[0:13:19] <grub> For real though, Conceptualization and Encyclopedia will carry the rest of your build if you know how to utilize them.
[0:13:36] <servicesuspension> my favorite is still half-light because it's just... FEAR
[0:13:37] <grub> They will do some serious work for your character.
[0:13:38] <+CateHecate> theres some really amazing art of Volition as like, a character, its super cool
[0:13:46] <DSD24> Electrochemistry kept telling me to drink all the time
[0:13:47] <+Jiggisnipe> Woolie also completely missed the Conceptualization third time's the charm joke when it comes to racists
[0:13:50] <laguerrilha> All skills are fun, it depends of taste
[0:13:53] <Nohorse> Volition is your bro, all my homies love Volition

[0:33:30] <+ReallyBigRocks> So where did Woolie leave off last time?
[0:33:30] <penitentpendant> @Nohorse Shortly after meeting the Scab Leader
[0:33:33] <user_naim> who the fuck is Ferra Tor?
[0:33:34] <andre11dr> MK is cool but also very lame
[0:33:34] <+CateHecate> Mortal Kombat is one of the only series i can think of where like 75% of the total cast of playable characters are UTTER jobbers
[0:33:35] <%Exiliator> 11

[0:34:02] <dds333a> Ferra/Torr was an MKX, and honestly one of the better ones
[0:34:03] <%gatorafan> the CU
[0:34:09] <leith_aziz> I think MK11 is the biggest letdown in terms of new characters. ALL 3 of them are jobbers
[0:34:11] <+CateHecate> Even some of the well known recurring characters are Jobbers!! like Baraka!

[0:35:00] <ingman112> Yeah be careful with those comments boys, spoilerz n shit
[0:35:04] <Solidnick18> tell em
[0:35:05] <user_naim> @grub STILL
[0:35:06] <+CateHecate> remember that time Qui Gon Chi saved anakin from tatooinerealm

[0:35:06] <+Kataguro> Welcome to Boogie Street
[0:35:07] <+kullumanati> Remember all racism is not equal
[0:35:09] <penitentpendant> Youtube comments: "I told you about Conceptualization bro!"
[0:35:12] <dds333a> Yeah, you're gonna be hearing it a bit
[0:35:12] <TrickModeX> whaaaaat weirdos on youtube/twitter/discord noooooooooo
[0:35:12] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Take off your high concept shirt, maybe
[0:35:13] <grub> oh damn, upgrade endurance!!!
[0:35:16] <grub> I literally
[0:35:18] <grub> died
[0:35:20] <grub> the first time I played the game
[0:35:24] <grub> killed by a light bulb
[0:35:25] <%SainEdge> Woolie HATES Art! And life! And everything!
[0:35:26] <ingman112> Endurance is lower b/c of damage
[0:35:32] <ingman112> Volition works the same
[0:35:34] <servicesuspension> they're gonna get big salt
[0:35:35] <Nohorse> Art school, more like FART school fuckin got'em Kappa
[0:35:39] <leith_aziz> They've gotta be trolling im asuming, right?
[0:35:42] <andre11dr> Because it's the hipster stat
[0:35:45] <aiutare47> Did anyone mention that damage is a debuff to stats?
[0:35:47] <%DiscoMatador> Endurance Get?
[0:35:48] <some_brave_apollo> Esprit De Corps and Shivers have the most interesting non-sequiters
[0:35:49] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Oh yeah aren‚Äôt they at 1 for each? Or have one damage on each
[0:35:51] <penitentpendant> END? Your HP is 1
[0:35:53] <sushahana> half light is so funny
[0:35:55] <crimsonharvest> for vague might need it reasons
[0:35:55] <solaireprophet> USE THEM FOR RETRYS
[0:35:58] <Indigo_Automaton> Your HP is super low
[0:35:59] <%Juriasu> you probably just forgot
[0:35:59] <ingman112> People have but I dunno if they heard yet
[0:36:01] <@Solidus_113> mid conversations checks
[0:36:01] <dustworthmain> white checks
[0:36:02] <%Exiliator> To use them "live" in convos
[0:36:03] <+Sveargieth> They let you retry checks
[0:36:03] <+ReallyBigRocks> You can level up after a white check to retry it @WoolieVersus
[0:36:04] <andre11dr> Endurance YOU HAVE 1
[0:36:04] <+SignScratch> Yea, people really out here analyzing a man's life based on videogame descisions
[0:36:05] <dds333a> @leith_aziz thats the conclusion I usually come to
[0:36:05] <%Lion_kun> You save them for checks you need
[0:36:05] <servicesuspension> you can retry white checks
[0:36:07] <bear_breaker20> the severe lack of racism is concerning tbh
[0:36:08] <Nohorse> @WoolieVersus Leveling up the relevant stat lets you retry a failed white check
[0:36:11] <CappuccinoGuil> You can use a Skill Point to unlock White Checks
[0:36:11] <+OblivionSword1> save for it rolls
[0:36:12] <LlewynMarie> gonna wear clothes to lower the stat
[0:36:13] <+HotBloodedHero> You can level up before any roll
[0:36:14] <Blank9> you can use them to add more thoughts too
[0:36:14] <$dudedude55555> use clothes for stat gains, use skill points for failed white checks
[0:36:19] <aiutare47> well you can heal but it wont increase your passive checks
[0:36:20] <%hax_metatron> Up END now
[0:36:22] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> to retry failed checks
[0:36:23] <andre11dr> You won't always have items
[0:36:25] <crimsonharvest> spending the point unlocks any relevant now-locked white checks
[0:36:25] <twohitgood> save levels for white checks.
[0:36:29] <ingman112> You only really need to hang onto one point, if you get multiple spend that shit
[0:36:30] <vindty> reset white checks
[0:36:30] <linSP> end just needs a heal
[0:36:31] <grub> yeah you won't get passive checks
[0:36:33] <sendart> tons of hidden checks tho
[0:36:39] <user_naim> oohh Ferra and Torr are the big guy and small guy. Wow.
[0:36:39] <niozonbi> It's for if you fail a check and want to repeat it
[0:36:39] <Chatterbox1991> @WoolieVersus try to have at leat one point stocked at all times, just in case.
[0:36:40] <Nohorse> Many checks have other modifiers like talking to people
[0:36:40] <twohitgood> it resets a failed white check.
[0:36:42] <CappuccinoGuil> Pat has Perception at 10
[0:36:43] <%Juriasu> from thought
[0:36:45] <nakunattakage> You can also unlock thought cabinet slots with skill points
[0:36:45] <%BlueJoneleth> You can invest in points to retry previously failed white checks.
[0:36:46] <penitentpendant> That's the Cap
[0:36:47] <grub> passive checks are like... most of the reason to upgrade stats, they have SO much to say
[0:36:48] <niozonbi> It resets a failed check
[0:36:48] <%hax_metatron> Yeah you can do more
[0:36:49] <Indigo_Automaton> You should really consider putting it into Endurance, you have VERY little HP
[0:36:50] <+HotBloodedHero> You do wanna keep one in stock, I think
[0:36:50] <sushahana> 13
[0:36:51] <+Mendin> Hobocop boosted the cap I think
[0:36:51] <%DiscoMatador> or to retry failed
[0:36:52] <Nohorse> Yeah Pat reached 10 Perception
[0:36:52] <+Kataguro> You can go real huge in stats
[0:36:52] <servicesuspension> there's hidden checks too, so don't keep your stats too low
[0:36:54] <+Jeshk0> its almost always better to wait to use your skill points when you really need them
[0:37:02] <niozonbi> Only spend when you fail a check and want to repeat it
[0:37:03] <ingman112> It's the base in the stat plus however many points you have plus items and thoughts and shit
[0:37:04] <grub> TAKEDA
[0:37:05] <andre11dr> Also we need Endurance for the..."W√∂men"
[0:37:07] <grub> mortal kombaaaaat
[0:37:10] <%hax_metatron> Yeah endurance is a great investment now
[0:37:12] <penitentpendant> The empty dots are the number of times you can level the stat.
[0:37:17] <kresnikhama> Endurance man
[0:37:21] <niozonbi> You save them for failed checks. It's the only way to repeat them
[0:37:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> Your inventory shows your buffs and debuffs as well
[0:37:24] <aiutare47> Damage is a debuff
[0:37:30] <LlewynMarie> having at least three points in HP is fine
[0:37:33] <+OblivionSword1> might as well heal
[0:37:34] <+Mendin> The amount of points max you can put into a skill is your relevant stat's base value. Several thoughts also increase skills' caps
[0:37:35] <dgull42> If you lose it, you'll hit 0.
[0:37:49] <Nohorse> You'll get more skillpoints don't worry
[0:37:49] <+Kataguro> Woolie, you can beat the game no matter what you spec into. Just do what you think is fun.
[0:37:52] <+dolresdei> There are no bad choices for levelling up, pretty much
[0:37:56] <ingman112> Even numbers are great targets to aim for
[0:38:00] <servicesuspension> you can raise your caps with some thoughts
[0:38:03] <andre11dr> Volition and Endurance are always a good level up
[0:38:10] <Nohorse> What a fine specimen that was
[0:38:11] <+OblivionSword1> no twitch integration today too huh
[0:38:16] <NeroInfinite> Getting more endurance is a good investment .
[0:38:18] <Lancaster_H> When your health/mental is damaged, the stat alongside it takes a minus as well for passive checks
[0:38:18] <sushahana> dont forget the body LUL
[0:38:21] <FloatYourGoat> I need to shit myself
[0:38:25] <+CateHecate> @WoolieVersus almost every check that is required for progression can have their difficulty made easier if you gather more relevant information or talk to the right people
[0:38:25] <ingman112> I think it makes a nice contrast to Pat's stream actually, to not do twitch integration
[0:38:33] <%SuckerPunchSyd> The s in scab stands for sus
[0:38:38] <penitentpendant> Generally stats are at their chattiest at 6. At 8 and above you start having your stats overpower your decision.
[0:38:43] <ingman112> You won't get Art Cop unless you make artsy choices
[0:38:50] <Nohorse> copolypse
[0:38:56] <Jalapeno300> what day is it
[0:38:56] <%hax_metatron> Acopolypse
[0:39:00] <andre11dr> Cop of the apocalypse is a little much
[0:39:00] <+Mendin> Measurehead has a fun thought you for you internalize too
[0:39:03] <dukenux> Cop of the Apocalypse is just Rorschach
[0:39:11] <ingman112> Yeah 6 is fine
[0:39:11] <Parapattern> The s in scab stands for skub
[0:39:12] <%nicversus> ACOPALYPSE
[0:39:14] <%Irridium> you can take the hit
[0:39:16] <dds333a> Suddenly gripped with EXTREME paranoia over the end of the world
[0:39:18] <Nohorse> Or maybe it was awesome BECAUSE it's so high? LUL

[0:40:35] <+dalmek> that's your class progression

[0:40:39] <Nohorse> What are your thoughts on absolute monarchs doing cocaine?

[0:41:32] <skyentombment> I mean, it's been firmly established that some of Woolie's preferred humour is unintentional/surprise racism, so I'm surprised this didn't happen before
[0:41:38] <+MightyDuckShoes> it took me forever to realize the dude on the monument in the first loading screen is the MC at some point in his mad binge
[0:41:40] <DSD24> Mal means bad
[0:41:42] <+Jiggisnipe> yep that is the word I would use to describe that guy
[0:41:45] <+dolresdei> Fuck the suzerainty!
[0:41:52] <%nicversus> The encyclopedia stat is basically that "money can be used to buy goods and services" bit from the simpsons
[0:42:03] <dukenux> Hookers and Blow
[0:42:05] <dds333a> They make it an art form
[0:42:05] <+krispen_wa> is this guy a reference to Louis XIV
[0:42:08] <NeroInfinite> In this case drugs.
[0:42:09] <+Kataguro> Like a dragon
[0:42:12] <Chatterbox1991> @WoolieVersus Kaiser Wilhelm II
[0:42:16] <%30kfiery> these type of games have great quality in the imagination of the beholder
[0:42:17] <dukenux> LOTS of hookers and blow
[0:42:18] <oda_flobunaga> Scrooge McDuck

[0:44:56] <ASpiffyGoat> airships huh
[0:45:02] <%saladin1911> People who take drugs and then think they've seen a spiritual realm are clearly incapable of critical thought, it's kind of hilarious
[0:45:03] <+dolresdei> @Prevot It's an archaic but apt word!
[0:45:04] <CappuccinoGuil> @Prevot sounds like Encyclopedia is a capitalist dog
[0:45:05] <+DenpaDev> comundard an actual term btw
[0:45:20] <%MrKerb> Has Woolie met metalhead yet?

[0:46:03] <penitentpendant> Apropos
[0:46:03] <UvBenServed> Shhh, don't worry about it
[0:46:09] <servicesuspension> the statue IS pretty awesome
[0:46:11] <DSD24> I like 1
[0:46:14] <aiutare47> The game says it
[0:46:14] <+dolresdei> absolutely 2
[0:46:16] <Estwilde> Ok that is funny
[0:46:17] <+CateHecate> thats actually really cool
[0:46:18] <%hax_metatron> Conceptualization MAX
[0:46:18] <+Kataguro> I mean that's kind of neat
[0:46:19] <sirtommygunn> even if it is ironic its a big middle finger to everyone living there
[0:46:19] <+vaderxyz1970> Measured by how up your own ass you are
[0:46:23] <%Exiliator> gotcha
[0:46:24] <$dudedude55555> 1
[0:46:31] <Crippl3> tbf it is a cool statue
[0:46:32] <%Sunriser41> Conceptualization is out of control
[0:46:35] <DSD24> Aww
[0:46:42] <+DenpaDev> We need more statues of abe lincon in the favelas
[0:46:44] <+Kataguro> Ah yes, Thought Leaders
[0:46:50] <+ReallyBigRocks> Dunkin on art students now
[0:46:51] <dds333a> you can see it in pieces
[0:46:53] <$dudedude55555> art coward
[0:46:54] <andre11dr> I picked 1 ,because i am very nihilistic
[0:46:54] <+dolresdei> Woolie with the correct art takes
[0:47:01] <%Juriasu> so close minded
[0:47:01] <servicesuspension> the audacity
[0:47:03] <ingman112> As soon as time passes people just see the statue returned
[0:47:07] <sirtommygunn> we COULD improve your community, but fuck you take my ironic art
[0:47:07] <ingman112> It's shit
[0:47:08] <Indigo_Automaton> It looks cool tho
[0:47:10] <CappuccinoGuil> It's almost like making a statue that immortalizes certain a POS of a country's history is a bad idea
[0:47:11] <%nicversus> so not only is woolie a racist, he's also anti-intellectual, I see how it is
[0:47:12] <Picia000123> put a plant or whatever, anything else
[0:47:13] <cutemuteprude> I would love more anti-statues tbh
[0:47:13] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> There should be no statues
[0:47:14] <%hax_metatron> LUL

[0:47:29] <zanzibarian_hamster> persona non grate is booooring though, the statue looks cool
[0:47:30] <linSP> ironic hitler statue
[0:47:31] <iacus_> that's missing the point of the statement, and the anti-statue
[0:47:31] <+Jiggisnipe> yea if you want them forgotten
[0:47:31] <dukenux> Putting up Hitler's bust in the midlle of a former getto, but giving it a clown nose

[0:48:12] <+MightyDuckShoes> Hitler with a the gun in his mouth, a plume of amber blossoming out the back of his head.
[0:48:13] <+DenpaDev> Not to mention you wouldn't live around it either
[0:48:14] <servicesuspension> Can you imagine it!? Like if we named our schools after really corrupt leaders
[0:48:15] <andre11dr> Aren't there Columbus statues?
[0:48:16] <CappuccinoGuil> Hmmmmm that WOULD be really weird. Like having statues of notorious slave owners or something

[0:49:48] <+Kataguro> Time for cool shit
[0:49:49] <Parapattern> That is an actual strat
[0:49:52] <%Javaa01> Taking your pants off is the right thing to do for some stats checks
[0:49:58] <dds333a> Seriously
[0:50:00] <penitentpendant> Now THERE'S a portrait
[0:50:01] <%hax_metatron> No one spoil this stuff for Woolie
[0:50:02] <+Razputin217> Reject Disco, Return to Hobo
[0:50:06] <Louie_Salmon> Polnareff earing
[0:50:09] <%smyld> I‚Äôm here for the change clothes reference
[0:50:11] <sendart> the pale Kreygasm
[0:50:15] <trickster721> That one is made up
[0:50:15] <crimsonharvest> probably a riff on daguerrotype
[0:50:17] <twohitgood> you don't have to play the game with pants.
[0:50:17] <pyshcocanuck> I love her character portrait
[0:50:24] <CappuccinoGuil> Holy shit, I just noticed how great her portrait is. Her hair waving in the back looks like she's blowing smoke. It's so cool
[0:50:25] <crimsonharvest> oh sick
[0:50:25] <dukenux> ambra is the stuff you find inside whales
[0:50:26] <aiutare47> Video games written by novelists
[0:50:27] <iacus_> wow i thought it was a made up word
[0:50:31] <dds333a> She's feeling it
[0:50:38] <+CateHecate> this game has SO much archaic language
[0:50:38] <zanzibarian_hamster> the portrait is an old lady facing left, right?
[0:50:48] <neostria> LONG LOST BROTHER??
[0:50:56] <Parapattern> Are you my mommy?
[0:50:56] <dds333a> Come on, guys, context CarlSmile
[0:50:59] <laguerrilha> I like how you try to learn new vocabulary instead like most who say "using big words, so pretentious writers"
[0:51:03] <crimsonharvest> is she exhaling an epic boof in that portrait
[0:51:16] <aiutare47> wait\
[0:51:18] <+SignScratch> Woolie, have you looked at your ledger?
[0:51:19] <aiutare47> huh
[0:51:22] <Nohorse> She's ripping a FAT CLOUD in that portrait
[0:51:25] <CappuccinoGuil> @crimsonharvest no, it's her hair, but it's drawn like that
[0:51:25] <+dolresdei> Well, guess we'll come back later!
[0:51:25] <+Kataguro> I've never seen Kim stop you there
[0:51:26] <%Javaa01> Yeah this is for later
[0:51:26] <ingman112> Kim say no for now
[0:51:26] <NeroInfinite> you can talk to her after kim goes to sleep
[0:51:27] <penitentpendant> Weirdly proactive of him
[0:51:27] <+DenpaDev> Hooka lady?
[0:51:30] <aiutare47> I never got that dialogue?
[0:51:31] <+CateHecate> vape naysh
[0:51:31] <%Javaa01> But now you know where she is
[0:51:39] <%Seancicle> remember they deserve to live Woolie
[0:51:43] <%Arancet> @SignScratch he did but failed the checks
[0:51:48] <%hax_metatron> Don't just be a cop to old women: Kim
[0:52:00] <penitentpendant> You failed both checks in the ledger
[0:52:05] <LlewynMarie> need to open it
[0:52:05] <penitentpendant> Logic and Interfacing
[0:52:05] <ingman112> You need to level up interfacing to try again
[0:52:06] <CappuccinoGuil> If you put a point into Logic you can do the check again
[0:52:13] <andre11dr> Still locked
[0:52:13] <therustystream> you can level up the stats to try again
[0:52:16] <Louie_Salmon> And logic was high, that's rough
[0:52:18] <therustystream> if you so desire
[0:52:20] <laguerrilha> You still have the √ßeft side of the map to explore
[0:52:22] <ingman112> You can check Map for that
[0:52:24] <aiutare47> MAP
[0:52:26] <Crippl3> tasks are on the MAP tab
[0:52:26] <niozonbi> MAP
[0:52:30] <+dolresdei> @WoolieVersus The Map screen shows your checks
[0:52:31] <niozonbi> Tasks on MAP
[0:52:32] <%Arancet> click map for checks
[0:52:35] <penitentpendant> Journal, then map
[0:52:39] <oda_flobunaga> the body, no vomiting
[0:52:40] <ingman112> Yeah try that again
[0:52:51] <CappuccinoGuil> yes, you compressed your shit
[0:52:51] <aiutare47> yes
[0:52:52] <ingman112> Go check it out first
[0:52:52] <andre11dr> You probably do have a level up ,I'd do it and try again
[0:52:53] <oda_flobunaga> yarp
[0:52:55] <niozonbi> Yes
[0:52:56] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Your shit compressed
[0:52:56] <twoto858> You can try again because you put a point into Endurance
[0:52:57] <+dolresdei> Now is definitely a good time to go check the body
[0:52:57] <LlewynMarie> getting into the harbor

[0:53:29] <Jalapeno300> body is a good option
[0:53:29] <linSP> shit compressor let‚Äôs you try it again
[0:53:30] <trickster721> If you level up you can try again anyway, use every shot at it
[0:53:34] <ingman112> You do you
[0:53:36] <ingman112> Take your time
[0:53:44] <andre11dr> But you still have just 1
[0:53:45] <+dolresdei> You've still got plenty of time! You can get a lot done day 1
[0:53:51] <CappuccinoGuil> There are other ways to buff your chances, it's not just the stats
[0:53:54] <dds333a> A good bit, yeah, but the body is indeed hanging. consider it
[0:53:54] <pyshcocanuck> Spend an upgrade point on endurance before you try
[0:53:54] <oda_flobunaga> taketh thy time
[0:53:56] <$dudedude55555> delicious humanox
[0:53:57] <%hax_metatron> There‚Äôs no hurry guys
[0:53:59] <ingman112> Yep
[0:54:05] <therustystream> you got time
[0:54:06] <laguerrilha> its best to explore the map first since you can get more levels before important stuff
[0:54:11] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Talking to people about *new* things
[0:54:14] <Johannen> Disco Elysium bringing back point and clicks
[0:54:24] <+CateHecate> @WoolieVersus contrary to how it seems the game doesnt really have that much of a time limit, or, if it does one, you can probably do literally every single thing in the game before reaching it, even taking your time really slowly.
[0:54:27] <aiutare47> best if he spends that point on Visual Calc so he can do the footprints I say
[0:54:29] <servicesuspension> take your time and talk to people to learn and thus get more chances
[0:54:30] <Louie_Salmon> @pyshcocanuck Nah, after, then you get two chances
[0:54:32] <Chatterbox1991> it does, actually
[0:54:34] <Nohorse> It's been hanging for a week, how much worse could it get? Kappa
[0:54:39] <%saladin1911> Imagine if time only passed when you spoke to other people. I'd never see tomorrow LUL NotLikeThis
[0:54:40] <+ReallyBigRocks> Strictly speaking, you don't even HAVE to look at the body
[0:54:48] <bufflb> time for advanced race theory!
[0:54:52] <ingman112> @aiutare47 He can retry that Day 2 as well
[0:54:53] <aiutare47> also Id say he should go check Kims Headlights

[1:05:49] <Blackleafx> Woolie your character LITERALLY has brain damage
[1:05:49] <%Juriasu> you have amnesia
[1:05:54] <aiutare47> but youve lost your memory
[1:05:55] <slix3431> HOBO cop!

[1:06:06] <laguerrilha> Other people dont know you have brain dmg
[1:06:11] <Blackleafx> @foxname96 he looked at the statue
[1:06:12] <%SivSarcast> It's kind of like Snake asking questions in MGS, I guess.
[1:06:16] <ingman112> Guy's a cop, so they're kind of obliged to tell him shit
[1:06:17] <Blackleafx> Oh this was no mere bender
[1:06:23] <+DenpaDev> That's why sorry cop exists
[1:06:24] <CappuccinoGuil> A lot of times you get to say "I literally have amnesia, help me"
[1:06:24] <ingman112> But you have amnesia so you just gotta lean into it
[1:06:26] <sendart> "Did you flunk every history class?"
[1:06:28] <foxname96> Cool, Thanks
[1:06:29] <Nohorse> You're a cop it's okay
[1:06:30] <Ids560> yeah that's why shit like amnesia and isekai are so popular
[1:06:30] <linSP> thankfully a lot of people are patient enough to explain reality
[1:06:31] <+ALazo> own your ignorance
[1:06:38] <Parapattern> You are a cop though, Woolie.
[1:06:39] <SomeAsianDood> You're a cop it's fine to ask weird questions
[1:06:41] <pyshcocanuck> "Snake get you're gun" "Gun?"
[1:06:42] <sirtommygunn> your cop nature lets you get away with being both stupid and an asshole

[1:06:50] <Picia000123> Ask everything, people will at worst just brush off your antics
[1:06:52] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> the fact you're even alive is surprising at all, let alone you're speaking and walking around
[1:06:58] <+dolresdei> Your character is literally brain damaged, and most character realize this, so being weird and lost works out usually
[1:07:03] <Johannen> Woolie, do you know the details of World War I? Some people are not as versed

[1:38:20] <%doomerskeletor13> My favorite tweet is when people complain about something being communist and it‚Äôs actually capitalism

[1:52:39] <%Sunriser41> this game is fantastic
[1:52:40] <+Kataguro> Failures aren't failures, they're alternate paths
[1:52:40] <pyshcocanuck> Failure inpires content
[1:52:41] <%doomerskeletor13> Failure is not the end
[1:52:48] <servicesuspension> I love how VC is also used for imagination
[1:52:49] <penitentpendant> Other stats can save you midfailure, or turn failures into successes
[1:52:50] <+aartbastiaan> Communist sandwich PogChamp
[1:52:55] <Nohorse> JOB IT UP
[1:52:55] <Ids560> Success isn't always good either
[1:52:57] <dukenux> Salt IS Essential Kappa
[1:52:57] <%doomerskeletor13> Sometimes failure can even give you a better outcome
[1:52:57] <spaceitaly> it's not just branching paths, it's branching paths in an argument about a sandwich
[1:52:58] <vavilonica> failures are not failures
[1:52:59] <+Jiggisnipe> MORE SALT
[1:53:01] <+OblivionSword1> PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt
[1:53:02] <SmartAssPawn089> "Failure" can save your life
[1:53:03] <TheRealGreaterGamer> They're not really succeses in the traditional sense the game is just giving you flavor text based on your higher or lower stats

[1:53:25] <%Juriasu> MISSION FAILED
[1:53:30] <%nicversus> I left for like 8 minutes to get some food, and we are now 12 levels deeper in the sandwich chat
[1:53:32] <grub> that was fucking WILD.
[1:53:33] <$hattrick61> Try again and go facist
[1:53:37] <%kyh9> SEIZING THE MEANS OF SANDWICH: FAILED

[1:53:49] <Broand> You took zero damage there, What's the matter?
[1:53:50] <seniormeatbox> this LP is cursed
[1:53:50] <%Juriasu> that was the best possible outcome
[1:53:51] <servicesuspension> This was a very deep conversation about... sandwiches
[1:53:51] <Nohorse> BUT THE CONTENT
[1:53:53] <+SignScratch> yea, Woolies luck is bad in this
[1:53:54] <Blank9> that was better than a success
[1:53:54] <+PkSilent01> LP FUNSY

[1:53:57] <+nokturnas2077> Fall forward
[1:53:58] <TheRealGreaterGamer> I missed the start of the stream. Did Woolie try to beat the shit out of Measurehead? and more importantly DID HE INTERNALIZE HIS RACE THEORY?
[1:53:59] <fritz_dacat> Or rely on teitch

[1:53:59] <UvBenServed> Failing the sandwich check was totally worth it
[1:53:59] <sushahana> the body melting lol
[1:53:59] <SonofMelonHead> Failing through is perfectly valid
[1:54:00] <+akajaybay> have you leveled up at all?
[1:54:01] <niozonbi> The faithrough starts now!
[1:54:02] <Blank9> you wouldn't have rhetoric tell you to fuck off otherwise
[1:54:03] <Tennochief> XCOM 2 LIVES AGAIN
[1:54:03] <andre11dr> Big FAILURE = BIG CONTENT
[1:54:03] <dukenux> Failure is always an option

[1:54:29] <niozonbi> Failing forward is a significant aspect of the plot
[1:54:30] <spaceitaly> woolie and reggie going to become new voices in the thought cabinet
[1:54:32] <5pencer1001> rememeber that you can bank a point to reattempt after failing a check
[1:54:37] <+add0607> We still loving Rhetoric, guys?
[1:54:38] <+akajaybay> it's definitely a game designed to be ok to fail
[1:54:38] <Johannen> You built this house...now stumble in the night inside

[1:54:48] <yomamma133713> @add0607 yes
[1:54:49] <servicesuspension> the only failure in this game is death, everything else pushes you forward
[1:54:53] <ingman112> That‚Äôs a based oneliner Reggie

[1:55:16] <+Kataguro> Tibbs is a dude
[1:55:18] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Did Woolie try to beat the shit out of Measurehead? and more importantly DID HE INTERNALIZE HIS RACE THEORY?
[1:55:26] <%saladin1911> perhaps David Cage was right. Maybe game overs are a failure of the game designer LUL
[1:55:27] <ingman112> Neither yet

[2:18:41] <+Jiggisnipe> Half Light is your fight-or-flight response. It enables you to sense the way situations are about to turn. It injects palpable fear into your heart ‚Äì fear that urges you act before it‚Äôs too late to act ever again; fear that makes you frighten others. It is the aggression that lets you squeeze every last drop of information out of a witness.

[2:31:02] <aiutare47> "rest"?
[2:31:03] <some_brave_apollo> every day is like sunday
[2:31:03] <spaceitaly> SUGGESTION (Challenging: Failure): A 'Sunday friend' - is that like a church thing?
[2:31:07] <servicesuspension> Is Reggie a deity?
[2:31:12] <seniormeatbox> reggie is god confirmed
[2:31:15] <Nekros4442> Did you hear Ono is the new COO of Delightworks who are publishing thw new Melty Blood?
[2:31:15] <Estwilde> I've heard it used for booty call in this, but I think it's a bit more derogatory usually. A friend, but not someone you hang out on friday and saturday, only on the rest days
[2:31:16] <%SainEdge> sure is
[2:31:18] <+samuraiknack> Is Reggie a character action game protagonist?
[2:31:18] <$dudedude55555> you don't even know yet reggie, the game is just starting
[2:31:20] <aiutare47> @servicesuspension he needs one of those halos like Kims got
[2:31:20] <andre11dr> Reggie would totally be a centrist
[2:31:22] <+A_DEAD_SHOW> the reggie podcast trademark
[2:31:23] <+Ropcord> IT'S SO GOOD
[2:31:26] <penitentpendant> Gotta do the ritual praising to the sun every SUNday
[2:31:30] <fritz_dacat> you planning to play this on your own time??
[2:31:31] <+coolthulhuu> it does things no other game has down with its writing
[2:31:32] <+Jeshk0> the writing and characters is just TOP TIER
[2:31:32] <Indigo_Automaton> It's one of the most fascinating fantasy worlds I've explored in a game
[2:31:34] <gamewarden92> I wish shivers would chime in more often.
[2:31:36] <%p4ntless> it's okay reggie you nailed that encyclopedia check on seeking arrangements
[2:31:39] <servicesuspension> Oh good if I could I'd commision a Disco Style portrait
[2:31:39] <%hax_metatron> It takes me back to smoking a blunt with friends in high school. When we thought ANYTHING was possible
[2:31:45] <andre11dr> Yeah the writing is SO GOOD
[2:31:50] <Djinnazz> Rom Com
[2:31:51] <penitentpendant> Point-and-click protag, maybe
[2:31:56] <%doomerskeletor13> You ok?
[2:31:57] <oda_flobunaga> I finished another run last week. The end is wonderful, if you can get to it
[2:31:58] <%livlinn> OhMyDog OhMyDog OhMyDog
[2:31:59] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Reggie the only backseat you and Woolie NEED to adhere to is to pass Measurehead conceptualtion check for CONTENT. You can still choose to knock him out or reject him afterwards lol
[2:32:00] <NeroInfinite> what
[2:32:00] <+Ropcord> FeelsBadMan
[2:32:01] <servicesuspension> Meguca is suffering
[2:32:03] <PinkSocks> Reggie Magica
[2:32:04] <ManlyMcBeefington> Magical Girl Reggie?
[2:32:06] <vadnhi> This existence is - in fact - a *REALLY( crappy Isekai.
[2:32:10] <+IvesNapalm> Reggie you were the best protagonist in Dokapon Kingdom
[2:32:13] <aiutare47> @servicesuspension Thats exactly what I was thinking, I want to see Woolie and Reggie's portrait
[2:32:13] <%BlueJoneleth> full facist playthough lol
[2:32:14] <+Bluecille> Madoka Regica
[2:32:14] <%livlinn> I'm worried for you Reggie
[2:32:24] <+CateHecate> literally one of the thoughts you can internalize in this game is your character hearing the name of something and going "what? that sounds fucking stupid" and then thinking about it for eight full hours, which make this one of the most relatable games ever
[2:32:25] <+Jiggisnipe> yea Reggie was the protag of Dokapon :)
[2:32:28] <MrPedrovsky> Any chance of more Souls LP?
[2:32:36] <Estwilde> There's so many different roads even from the very start
[2:32:41] <camelwizard> Played as a meathead cop in my run, glad to see y'all's big brain run!
[2:32:45] <derap41> Muscle cop is the only one that is really boring
[2:32:46] <+A_DEAD_SHOW> how's the pc going?
[2:32:50] <+Mendin> a STAGGERING level of dialogue
[2:32:53] <penitentpendant> There are a TON of passive checks you never see between playthroughs
[2:32:57] <ingman112> I missed it; are they done for the day or taking a break?
[2:32:57] <Jp_DrZaius> Hey Reggie. Have you played a pen and paper rol game? like dungeons and dragons
[2:32:58] <Crippl3> @CateHecate is that the wompty dompty centre?
[2:33:00] <servicesuspension> All roads lead to Rome, but what does the traveler become?
[2:33:00] <andre11dr> It's the most reactive story I've ever seen
[2:33:01] <5pencer1001> in my first playthrough i killed myself by turning on the lights
[2:33:02] <%chrisarithmetic> there are like 350,000 lines of dialogue
[2:33:02] <+Jeshk0> yeah im gonna do a psycho/drug cop for my second run
[2:33:05] <%livlinn> Maduca sequel announced
[2:33:05] <Nekros4442> Did you hear Ono is the new COO of Delightworks who are publishing thw new Melty Blood?
[2:33:06] <Josef_Stryker> You ever reached a personal goal in something like a fighting game and wondered 'what now'? Because I'm having that feeling lately after reaching Gold in SFV
[2:33:11] <derap41> fuck them ISPs
[2:33:11] <%doughvatkyn> it's the build plus random rolls so
[2:33:11] <Johannen> My first playthrou was a muscle cop, its realy is the worst
[2:33:16] <Zomner> Canadian ISPs DansGame
[2:33:22] <trickster721> Kim didn't try to stop Pat from talking to the old truck lady, and I have no idea why
[2:33:24] <nivlac_555> ISPs blow
[2:33:24] <Robot_Nixon_> FeelsBadMan
[2:33:25] <%doughvatkyn> it's tough to get an identical playthrough
[2:33:26] <+Rancaliber_> @ingman112 Woolie is taking a bathroom break.
[2:33:26] <%cobalt_phoenix_> broooo ISPs are the worst even in the US
[2:33:28] <+samuraiknack> Heard any good music lately?
[2:33:33] <ingman112> Thx
[2:33:34] <andre11dr> Yo Reggie, what's a hot album that bumbs in your whip
[2:33:36] <vadnhi> In other news, Woolie is *really* enjoyin' his Poopin'...
[2:33:45] <otakon17> it's infrastructure in the United States

[2:33:46] <penitentpendant> @trickster721 Pat talked to her when he had a reason, investigating the plot
[2:33:51] <aiutare47> Reggie, what radicalized you?
[2:33:51] <oda_flobunaga> @trickster721 pat had learned about the Pale already
[2:33:57] <BabblingBayou> ISPs do be like that sometimes...
[2:33:58] <derap41> @otakon17 you can hear him grunting
[2:34:02] <Josef_Stryker> Unfortunate
[2:34:13] <Zomner> hell yeah
[2:34:14] <leith_aziz> Sorry to hea that Reggie
[2:34:16] <otakon17> @derap41 hah!

[2:34:17] <servicesuspension> Disco's gonna have a tv show, a tabletop game and at least one sequel. Aside from the novel. We're on for a good ride
[2:34:20] <penitentpendant> @trickster721 There are a lot of flags that can change interactions if you trigger them before meeting characters
[2:34:24] <Bl4ckK4ngaroo> brucegLaugh
[2:34:26] <jorniev> MAY 1 , TITANFALL 2 stream?
[2:34:37] <Crippl3> YEAAAAAAH

[2:34:42] <+Kataguro> RIP
[2:34:44] <penitentpendant> @servicesuspension I look forward to watching Pat or Paige play PREGNANT COP
[2:34:44] <laguerrilha> The are background rolls that might not happen on a second game. its quite random what you get
[2:34:46] <derap41> @servicesuspension I don't think Disco would work as anythign but a game
[2:34:47] <jorniev> rip
[2:34:48] <5pencer1001> these wounds they will not heal
[2:34:52] <aiutare47> @servicesuspension TV show would likely be bad, its the choices and the reading and the narration that sells it so hard
[2:34:53] <nivlac_555> lol
[2:34:53] <seniormeatbox> DUDE SAME
[2:34:53] <Crippl3> lmao
[2:34:54] <otakon17> @servicesuspension I cannot wait for the sequel, I would like an actual combat system though to be honest even if it's only a little bit.

[2:36:47] <penitentpendant> @Mrbaconator Bless the name of that restaurant, it can lead to awkward conversations if people aren't aware of the name
[2:36:48] <+ReallyBigRocks> @jorniev It's the big thing at Wendy's, it's a big pile of meat and cheese and its fuckin delish
[2:36:50] <trickster721> I used up all my luck for this lifetime on them bringing back the Big Fish
[2:36:51] <@Solidus_113> I miss KFC Toonie Tuesdays
[2:36:51] <Estwilde> Yep subway's been around since like the 50s
[2:36:51] <Crippl3> capitalism!

[2:36:56] <TheRetrorrificMan> now you're talking communism
[2:36:57] <%thotbane> @LlewynMarie In-N-Out.......has changed.....
[2:36:58] <%Juriasu> comrade Reggie speaking truth
[2:36:58] <aiutare47> Denny's?
[2:36:58] <Zomner> Captialism strikes again!
[2:36:59] <servicesuspension> subway is a stressful experience that fills me with nihilism
[2:37:00] <Estwilde> Arby's roast beef üòã
[2:37:01] <%p4ntless> this is why we need communism
[2:37:01] <extradopeness> arbys owns
[2:37:01] <+JustBlubs> Whaaat? They got the meats.
[2:37:02] <derap41> Not only do you need to make a profit you need to increase profits each year
[2:37:02] <DSD24> Raising Cane's is great
[2:37:03] <Picia000123> I've ate Subway thrice, and I was dissapointed every time
[2:37:03] <vadnhi> Even been down to my town of Plattsburgh, Reggie? And - if so - can you educate everyone else in chat as to how much of a sh*thole it is? :P
[2:37:04] <Reveresao> Canes is trash
[2:37:05] <+solidbison> have you had Whataburger?
[2:37:05] <5pencer1001> i ate subway way too much too wuickly and i burned out on it
[2:37:06] <$hattrick61> Popeyes?
[2:37:06] <%Mathochism> Have you experienced Nando's Peri-Peri, though?
[2:37:07] <aiutare47> Do you fuck with Denny's?
[2:37:08] <%p4ntless> yo cane's FUCKS
[2:37:09] <+Mrbaconator> have you had 5 guys burgers and fries? @WoolieVersus
[2:37:10] <+ReallyBigRocks> Arby's is fine, Caine's sauce is so good
[2:37:11] <%livlinn> I miss Wendy's
[2:37:12] <Josef_Stryker> Earl of Sandwich was great
[2:37:13] <+AbnormalVoid> places can only exist like that insofar as people are willing to settle for it
[2:37:14] <otakon17> Arby's actually has really good roast beef, the thing they advertise
[2:37:17] <Space_Pagan> Seize the means of burger production!
[2:37:18] <aiutare47> WHAT
[2:37:20] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> canes is fire no lie
[2:37:20] <emeraldskrull> do not visit arbys
[2:37:20] <Bootkiller6> KFC used be so good like 10-15 years ago, but it has REALLY dropped in quality
[2:37:21] <oda_flobunaga> Chipotle?
[2:37:22] <@Solidus_113> There's an Arby's in my town
[2:37:24] <+Myname1sjeff> denny's is bottom tier
[2:37:25] <Lalunite> Denny's is a sad place
[2:37:25] <+jayayanami> burger King used to be godlike 12 years ago
[2:37:25] <Indigo_Automaton> Get yourself some Whataburger
[2:37:26] <Louie_Salmon> Arby's is extremely devisive
[2:37:27] <extradopeness> dennys is shit
[2:37:27] <zanzibarian_hamster> The only fast food I could ever stand is 5 guys
[2:37:28] <+Razputin217> Fast food tier list when?
[2:37:32] <Chatterbox1991> @WoolieVersus Popeye's ive found to be a superior, not shitty version of KFC
[2:37:32] <+Jiggisnipe> roast beef
[2:37:32] <otakon17> like it's not as good as Delicatessen it's good

[2:37:42] <%p4ntless> arby's curly fries whip ass
[2:37:42] <trickster721> Subway and Dominoes are for people who live in towns with no real pizza or sandwich places
[2:37:43] <+ReallyBigRocks> Very average roast beef sandwiches

[2:38:08] <+Jeshk0> arbys got a lot of beef sandwiches, but their chicken sandwiches are actually FIRE
[2:38:09] <+Bluecille> You either go to Denny's as an elderly person, or at 1 AM when there's no other place open and you wanna get to-go.

[2:38:32] <%Sunriser41> you can go slowly, dont eat meat in home, but have meat while eating out
[2:38:34] <%doomerskeletor13> I think veganism is definitely moral but it‚Äôs not viable for me currently
[2:38:36] <Indigo_Automaton> I'll go vegan when plant-based or lab grown meat is indistinguishable from the real thing
[2:38:38] <derap41> Reduce is the main point

[2:41:52] <zanzibarian_hamster> Paleo is unironically really good for you, even if the logic is a bit sophratic
[2:41:53] <%livlinn> I mean factory farming
[2:41:53] <WakeUpThrow> That's fucked up
[2:41:53] <laguerrilha> Farmers do it
[2:41:54] <cutemuteprude> Yeah, Pat's soul is a big ethical concern
[2:41:55] <Robot_Nixon_> I couldnt FeelsBadMan
[2:41:55] <AnneSQF> pigs have brain chemicals too
[2:41:55] <+Ropcord> it's a little weird
[2:41:57] <aiutare47> Plenty of people do it
[2:41:57] <SomeAsianDood> Not a problem to me
[2:41:57] <Ids560> isn't it more like the resources we're using to raise and slaughter these animals fucking up the planet more?
[2:41:58] <+FlyingRamen> farmers do it all the time
[2:41:59] <derap41> People do that
[2:42:00] <KaiserMario> Pigs will eat pigs
[2:42:01] <+Jiggisnipe> some people do
[2:42:01] <%Sunriser41> just eat your pets once they die
[2:42:01] <spaceitaly> what about eating the rich?
[2:42:03] <%doughvatkyn> go off woolie
[2:42:03] <Tennochief> you'll be a fucked up person for eating your own pet, but sure
[2:42:03] <iacus_> there might be merit to the "we have evolved" argument, but we'd have to think about it
[2:42:04] <+Trask07> people 100% do that
[2:42:04] <%Exiliator> if it died, maybe yeah?
[2:42:04] <otakon17> @oda_flobunaga this is true but we could always reduce their numbers and usage by going over to other stuff, like boll weevils for protein paste.
[2:42:05] <servicesuspension> Eating bugs is good for the planet and they're tasty
[2:42:06] <derap41> Farmers grow their own pigs
[2:42:09] <jorniev> EAT the soul of the pig to get it's power
[2:42:09] <5pencer1001> let humans make decisions, dont confine your thoughts to hyper specific -isms
[2:42:09] <andre11dr> I my grandparents
[2:42:11] <Mundkipz> Didn't Gordon Ramsey make his kids take care of livestock and then slaughtered them?
[2:42:12] <TheRealGreaterGamer> This topic is too sensitive. Can we go back to racism and fascism now?
[2:42:15] <aiutare47> We did that growing up, theyre pets
[2:42:16] <+CateHecate> maybe a human's status as the apex predator and the most intelligent creatures on the planet should be used to find ways that we dont have to kill for sustenance?
[2:42:17] <%cobalt_phoenix_> if you raise it knowing you'll eat it then sure, if you spontaneously decide to do it it's weirder
[2:42:18] <+FlyingRamen> Paige
[2:42:19] <%andrewofbob> Some people farm chickens in the garden and eat them
[2:42:22] <%livlinn> I'd rather feed myself to my dog
[2:42:25] <+pupil31> LUL
[2:42:26] <Tennochief> LUL
[2:42:26] <derap41> These are specifically eating pigs for the farmers
[2:42:29] <ingman112> Ron swanson
[2:42:29] <%gitgouda> they literally sell those animals for slaughter
[2:42:30] <%livlinn> dog supremacy
[2:42:30] <%gatorafan> My family ate a pet goat daedra1DerpyTibs
[2:42:31] <+nuttbrain> lots of crop goes towards feeding animals that could go to feeding people
[2:42:31] <ingman112> And plague
[2:42:32] <Bootkiller6> This is an appropriate mood for Disco, honestly
[2:42:33] <Zomner> yeah, get back to MORALISM
[2:42:35] <+nokturnas2077> Woolie is passing all these Electrochemistry checks
[2:42:36] <LlewynMarie> I eat meat, but with what beef production is doing to the world, I choose not to eat cheap beef
[2:42:37] <$hattrick61> VEGGIE-REGGIE
[2:42:40] <servicesuspension> this game gets the political juices going
[2:42:40] <+Jeshk0> Keep it light yo, get back to Communist purges
[2:42:41] <Tennochief> Zebra were made to die
[2:42:41] <%SuckerPunchSyd> LUL
[2:42:45] <%BlueJoneleth> Internalize : Vegan Cop
[2:42:49] <Tennochief> we could eat Zebras instead
[2:42:51] <spaceitaly> i'll just filter-feed
[2:42:53] <+Jiggisnipe> beans are good
[2:42:54] <+ReallyBigRocks> Your body does in fact need things
[2:42:54] <jorniev> someone once adopted a pet pig and then ate it, thy got sued
[2:42:55] <+SignScratch> as opposed to never having health issues with meat. lol
[2:42:56] <servicesuspension> I have solid anecdotal evidence
[2:42:57] <otakon17> VEGAN COP NEEDS TO BE IN A SEQUEL
[2:42:58] <+za7az> It's weird to raise an animal as a pet then eat it. It is pretty normal to feed an animal as livestock with the intention of eating it from the get-go.
[2:43:01] <zanzibarian_hamster> Herbivorous animals are built to die, it's wierd
[2:43:06] <derap41> Reduce first no need to stop
[2:43:07] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Beastars has an interesting point on that conversation, Legoci gets a talk about it from a Sea Animal that recontextualized and made him more whole
[2:43:08] <%Deft_Thought> Lotta sunk cost fallacy up in this bitch
[2:43:11] <andre11dr> My parents did totally eat my pet duck ,i was not happy to say the least
[2:43:20] <andre11dr> Not a joke
[2:43:20] <+Bluecille> @zanzibarian_hamster everything is built to die...
[2:43:23] <%thotbane> Adventists know what they're messing with re: Health
[2:43:25] <triangularblasphemy> We are all built to die, evolution doesn't care
[2:43:30] <aiutare47> @za7az The two are often intertwined, its hard to raise something completely detached from it
[2:43:31] <derap41> Reduce is the key
[2:43:33] <SmortyPuffin> oh people who pay a lot of attention to their diet live longer? wild
[2:43:35] <otakon17> @za7az I could never do that, pets are family. If we had a pet pig, they'd die of old age probably
[2:43:37] <LlewynMarie> there's also plenty of good farmers that see the animals they raise as something more than something they're going to kill for food.
[2:43:38] <Nekros4442> @za7az Theres an entire manga/anime that tackles this pretty well called Silver Spoon
[2:43:39] <Mundkipz> Woolie, would you do it for Vegan Powers?
[2:43:41] <oda_flobunaga> paleo vegan tho
[2:43:43] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus I have to implore that you guys attempt to pass Measurehead's conceptualization check eventually. It's easily the BEST "content" in the game. That's all. :D
[2:43:47] <+Jiggisnipe> Saturdays make them live longer
[2:43:48] <+OblivionSword1> a Well balance diet is key
[2:43:48] <+ReallyBigRocks> Yo fuckin Baconators tho
[2:43:50] <5pencer1001> eating food contributes to heat death of universe, only ethical thing is to crawl into sea and drown

[3:11:14] <penitentpendant> You're fine, you're on a branch and can go back later
[3:11:19] <spaceitaly> don't worry you can use your gun to get what you want instead OH WAIT
[3:11:28] <Louie_Salmon> It's hard to really screw yourself out of anything, that's kind of this game's whole M.O.
[3:11:29] <otakon17> "I could have eaten it for all know" XD
[3:11:30] <+yusefHD> usually things like "Move on", or "Hold up", or "Wait".
[3:11:36] <vadnhi> Joyce - of all people - is *designed( to be fully-questionable numerous times at your leisure.
[3:11:41] <derap41> LUL
[3:11:58] <+yusefHD> Joyce = Choice LUL
[3:12:02] <otakon17> Kimk has your back though
[3:12:04] <derap41> Kim coming in with the save
[3:12:09] <penitentpendant> Kim has faith in you, even though he just met you today
[3:12:09] <Indigo_Automaton> Going through questions top to bottom is usually the intended way
[3:12:14] <Zomner> @vadnhi I remember spending over an hour with going all the discussion topics when I originally played the game
[3:12:29] <+Kataguro> You could pump him up a little
[3:12:33] <+KilogramHours> PUMP
[3:12:34] <Blank9> psyche skills always good
[3:12:34] <%thotbane> "We have come to terms."
[3:12:36] <LordOfThePoultry> pump that suggestion
[3:12:37] <SonofMelonHead> Think you got a level up point
[3:12:39] <derap41> Who's being played here Woolie
[3:12:40] <FassieFons> PUMP IT UP
[3:12:42] <+OblivionSword1> looks good
[3:12:43] <Ids560> you have 2 points to spend now
[3:12:43] <Indigo_Automaton> You have two points
[3:12:44] <aiutare47> visual calc for the footprints though
[3:12:44] <otakon17> you got another skill point too
[3:12:46] <+yusefHD> Pamp eet aap
[3:12:46] <+UnderseaMagic> you have 0 savor faire

[3:12:55] <otakon17> ASK ONE FIRST
[3:12:56] <DSD24> Thank goodness
[3:12:57] <vadnhi> @Zomner That's cause Joyce is the main 'info-dump' character of the game. :P
[3:12:57] <Louie_Salmon> Yeyeye
[3:12:58] <5pencer1001> try before dropping a skill point if its white, if you fail putting that point in will let you retry
[3:12:59] <laguerrilha> He is saving the other point for saving a check
[3:13:00] <ingman112> @yeeyeyee shhhh
[3:13:04] <%gatorafan> CHARISSSMA

[3:15:29] <ingman112> @yeeyeyee thought you were referring to the previous playthrough talking to her. Either way, don‚Äôt hint at story stuff like that
[3:15:29] <iacus_> Joyce has tons of text
[3:15:49] <aiutare47> Why does Joyce always make everyone horny?
[3:15:53] <5pencer1001> investigate the drugs, but fuck the capitalists
[3:16:01] <iacus_> she doesn't?
[3:16:01] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts

[3:16:07] <+CateHecate> doesnt actually go that way
[3:16:09] <derap41> Time to Moralist
[3:16:13] <penitentpendant> Game: "It's too late! YOU'RE ALREADY A PINKERTON!"
[3:16:16] <dukenux> it's the dominant sugar mommy aura
[3:16:17] <Zomner> pick two of these factions or be a filthy moralist
[3:16:20] <SonofMelonHead> It's not exactly jedi and sith
[3:16:20] <TheRealGreaterGamer> ENLIGHTENED CENTRISM TIME

[3:16:23] <%Sunriser41> who are the jedi though
[3:16:23] <cutemuteprude> From my perspective, it's the Jedi that are communist
[3:16:25] <+OblivionSword1> Time to become MORALIST
[3:16:26] <SolSwagGuy56> THE COP SIDE
[3:16:26] <%andrewofbob> Jedi, Sith, and Muggles
[3:16:33] <%kyh9> Jedi and Sith is just Fascists and Fascists but they say please first
[3:16:38] <penitentpendant> Snarky
[3:16:38] <Ids560> you can be a centrist and get laughed at if you really want
[3:16:39] <laguerrilha> true
[3:16:41] <TheRealGreaterGamer> LUL
[3:16:43] <pyshcocanuck> The old republic Jedi are basically moralists
[3:16:44] <otakon17> God I don't even REMEMBER where the badge is

[3:19:50] <marcdyllan> wrong type of syndicate guys, jesus...haha
[3:19:53] <+DenpaDev> So they can demand crack cocaine
[3:19:55] <servicesuspension> they can do more than one thing
[3:20:02] <twohitgood> it's what happens when liberals head up the union.
[3:20:07] <pyshcocanuck> didn't the Yakuza start as a dockworkers organization?

[3:20:14] <jorniev> unions usually end up being super corrupt
[3:20:18] <SonofMelonHead> Remember that racist lorry driver that was transporting "apples"?
[3:20:18] <aiutare47> @pyshcocanuck Gamblers I think
[3:20:26] <+Lord_Scrublet> Beautiful game. Hope you are enjoying it
[3:20:29] <derap41> @Zomner owe me a cole
[3:20:31] <servicesuspension> most mafia start as some kind of workers assocation, citizen militia or stuff like that
[3:20:32] <@Menitta> "but I want to party"
[3:20:34] <%Sunriser41> time to visit the racisttt lorry drives again
[3:20:36] <5pencer1001> racism and drugs finally team up
[3:20:37] <Zomner> @derap41 no u
[3:20:46] <%nicversus> they actually ground up philippe the squanderer's drug addled body after taking it out of the river, and distilled ultra drugs from it
[3:20:54] <vadnhi> 'Ahpulls'
[3:20:57] <derap41> only got peps
[3:21:03] <Zomner> DansGame
[3:21:13] <derap41> Its the same
[3:21:15] <pyshcocanuck> "pomme"
[3:21:17] <Crippl3> ah yes, this all seems on the level
[3:21:46] <%HeroToxiko> @nicversus you see that, thats that death
[3:21:49] <derap41> Honestly the Devs must have loved The Wire
[3:22:07] <servicesuspension> they did, they put it on their inspiration page, along with true detective
[3:22:42] <derap41> it shows but they did add their own spin and art to it
[3:22:44] <Zomner> @derap41 look up Disco Elysium Influences from the Steam page for the game. They mention it
[3:22:50] <otakon17> DRUGS
[3:22:50] <5pencer1001> pretty sure there is no actual time limit on any tasks in this game
[3:22:54] <otakon17> you GOTTA stop them drugs
[3:22:54] <+Kataguro> Drugs ARE bad after all
[3:22:59] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Evil Union vs Evil Capitalism
[3:23:01] <%kyh9> Evil corporations tries to keep drugs off the streets to fuck over workers union
[3:23:02] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:23:03] <servicesuspension> the CIA is gonna ravage Revachol with crack
[3:23:05] <ulcaban> But Drugs Tho!
[3:23:15] <%kyh9> It's a cross-fire of charity!
[3:23:32] <derap41> only legal drugs at 1800% price hike
[3:23:35] <SonofMelonHead> Same
[3:23:36] <vadnhi> Winners don't do Drugs... Unless those drugs are *SURE* to help you *WIN!*
[3:23:37] <%Deft_Thought> Yup
[3:23:41] <Zeif00> same
[3:23:41] <AhmCha> yeah
[3:23:42] <yeeyeyee> woolie, decriminalize doesn't mean drug smugglers don't go to prison
[3:23:42] <TheRealGreaterGamer> I cant imagine WHY LUL
[3:23:42] <Indigo_Automaton> TRUTH
[3:23:43] <+ALazo> Sure but which ones
[3:23:44] <+Kataguro> But this is gang shit, so that's not really a factor
[3:23:45] <dukenux> War on Drugs is a sham
[3:23:53] <+CateHecate> maybe dont sell Horse on street corners, but sure
[3:23:54] <Indigo_Automaton> Prohibition never works
[3:23:55] <penitentpendant> How many times to politicians get caught in drug parties and nothing happens to them?
[3:24:06] <derap41> like 60% of heroin users started off on medication
[3:24:06] <+Bluecille> the state of oregon recently decriminalized all known street drugs, so
[3:24:12] <%HeroToxiko> prohibition is how you get the dark market
[3:24:16] <+krispen_wa> Yeah man, decriminalize METH and SPEED
[3:24:17] <Indigo_Automaton> @Bluecille And we love it here :D
[3:24:21] <servicesuspension> electrochemistry is your friend

[3:24:30] <yeeyeyee> @krispen_wa literally yes
[3:24:39] <derap41> @krispen_wa Worked for the Nazis at least at the start
[3:24:41] <pyshcocanuck> "ey we just need to wet our beak"
[3:24:45] <5pencer1001> the only way to get regular people worried about drugs as a health issue is when white people start falling for them
[3:24:53] <5pencer1001> see: opiods
[3:24:55] <+Bluecille> @Bluecille i'm still sad i left... at least weed is still legal in cali üòÅ
[3:25:04] <some_brave_apollo> @5pencer1001 where the hell have you been
[3:25:06] <spaceitaly> portugal legalised all drugs and it decreased drug deaths, drug use, and drug-related crime
[3:25:12] <%HeroToxiko> @derap41 works for norway
[3:25:15] <andre11dr> Also the prisons love to use it as an excuse to give minorities 30 years for weed, for the prison industrial system
[3:25:20] <+krispen_wa> Lets decriminalize murder
[3:25:21] <zanzibarian_hamster> Decriminalise people USING, not having some weird libertarian paradise where you can get a gallon of PCP with your happy meal
[3:25:22] <penitentpendant> A typical lorryman might hold up a cross if she approaches them
[3:25:24] <+krispen_wa> and then murder rates will go down
[3:25:38] <yeeyeyee> @krispen_wa that's really not the same thing at all and you know it, quit trolling

[3:25:57] <5pencer1001> or just investigate then fish for a bribe
[3:25:58] <dukenux> American private prison system is it's whole separate fucked up thing, though yes, it does tie to drug prohibition
[3:25:59] <ingman112> Tommy, rld, and the old lady
[3:26:03] <%HeroToxiko> it's almost like not dehumanizing people, makes less people fell dehumanized, wild concept
[3:26:05] <andre11dr> In the US you will get more years on drug charges than rape

[3:35:17] <yeeyeyee> @hax_metatron play the game and find out
[3:35:20] <%hax_metatron> Her money lets her be nice to you. As simple as that
[3:35:22] <%hax_metatron> I played the game
[3:35:26] <%andrewofbob> She also get you 60 r√©al
[3:35:29] <yeeyeyee> then you're dumb lol
[3:35:29] <servicesuspension> Joyce might not be a good person, but her job ain't easy
[3:35:30] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> with a name like Jean Luc I now want him voiced by Patrick Stewart
[3:35:31] <%andrewofbob> gave*
[3:35:32] <brachydios777> Compared to some of the othet characters we met, Joyce is pretty chill
[3:35:37] <some_brave_apollo> rich people are worse than bad people, duh
[3:35:38] <%hax_metatron> She tells you cool stuff but the games reminds you it's because she's rich she knows all the things
[3:35:39] <+krispen_wa> I thought Jean-Luc was just some reference to an in universe person
[3:35:41] <pi_in_the_sci> evert is the best character in this game by so much
[3:35:42] <+krispen_wa> not Measurehead
[3:35:47] <%ppangboi> Joyce and Evrart make such interesting counterparts
[3:35:47] <sionteemo405> what a time when racists and drug cartels are for the people LUL
[3:35:51] <5pencer1001> people are bad, dont look for a person to invest all your moral support to, they can never live up to what you truly desire
[3:35:57] <vadnhi> I like the idea of political alignments as akin to pokemon types and Joyce can only communicate in "Corp-Corp! Corpity-Corp!" noises. :D
[3:36:02] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus I'm sure these are just bits and jokes but it should go without saying that nothing is black and white in this game. It's superbly written.
[3:36:05] <dukenux> Joyce is an example why rich people can get away with some crap, and still be well beloved by the public
[3:36:08] <%hax_metatron> Joyce is definitely not a bad person but she's no good egg either.
[3:36:11] <derap41> Wait Union bad?
[3:36:15] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @otakon17
[3:36:15] <+krispen_wa> Joyce is...far more interesting than what people here say she is
[3:36:17] <pyshcocanuck> Note that they had to fight for overtime and medical
[3:36:18] <brainbustaaaaa> oh no overtime and a medical plan, what bastards
[3:36:22] <Ids560> both sides in this conflict are dogshit but hers is worse
[3:36:23] <servicesuspension> oh a medical plan, what a luxury
[3:36:30] <Picia000123> Union indeed very bad
[3:36:40] <yeeyeyee> nobody in this game passes a purity test

[3:36:44] <vadnhi> "Lisa needs Braces!' ...Dental Plan!"
[3:36:45] <penitentpendant> @hax_metatron Her compared to the union rep could be a good debate of "The Means" vs "The Ends" and which side is "Justified?"
[3:36:45] <iacus_> the union is corrupt af as well

[3:37:04] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Kim is the only Good person in this game lol
[3:37:06] <%hax_metatron> @penitentpendant I think it's as simple as: "Decent lady working for evil vs. slimy fuck working for good"
[3:37:08] <brunoberserk> ... PAT ???
[3:37:10] <brachydios777> I mainly appreciate that she is respectful to the player
[3:37:13] <+krispen_wa> Cuno is the only good person in the game
[3:37:13] <andre11dr> Joyce is not ass bad as the other factions, but she's still corporate bullshit
[3:37:22] <SonofMelonHead> Whatever his politics, evrart is a mafioso
[3:37:31] <5pencer1001> because she is trying to turn you into a tool of capital
[3:37:34] <Crippl3> Egg Head is the only good person in this game
[3:37:43] <+krispen_wa> We're all tools of capital in the end

[3:41:26] <%JustToWatch> being hesitant to ask questions because he doesn't want to look dub, but has no problem widely careening between ideologues is an interesting method of roleplay, I'll give Woolie that
[3:41:29] <+Kataguro> A man who Pat refused to talk to entirely
[3:41:31] <dukenux> you can technically be a nihilist and still have a positive outlook
[3:41:38] <+projectmanatees> Scab leader
[3:41:48] <penitentpendant> @Kataguro He did talk to him late game, with all flags triggered

[3:46:26] <+justianxix> yes

[3:48:47] <+Kataguro> Despite the "Tribe", it's economic, not racial
[3:48:51] <laguerrilha> To umlock a slot you need to spend 1 skill point
[3:48:54] <5pencer1001> you could swap out the apacocop one
[3:48:55] <Johannen> Woolie again with Race
[3:48:58] <iacus_> go4it

[3:49:36] <+yusefHD> I did a high conc, and inland run. Too damn good.
[3:49:36] <aiutare47> Indotribes have nothing to do with race, they are the companies that were given free reign by the crown, East India Company shit

[3:50:25] <Indigo_Automaton> You're like the Nomad Soul
[3:50:25] <%DiscoMatador> she already knows you have a memory problem
[3:50:30] <spaceitaly> to understand a crime, you must understand the world it was committed in
[3:50:35] <+yusefHD> @servicesuspension Dirk Suicide lmao
[3:50:35] <Bootkiller6> Everything is connected
[3:50:38] <jorniev> remember chat let's shut up with this one
[3:50:40] <Bootkiller6> unless it isn't
[3:50:43] <5pencer1001> there needs to be a stat called coward
[3:50:45] <penitentpendant> Need to supercharge that Inland
[3:50:52] <5pencer1001> that just lets you exit conversations
[3:50:54] <+yusefHD> "What are we some sort of Holistic Detective Agency?"
[3:51:01] <@Menitta> there SHOULD be a coward stat
[3:51:02] <+Kataguro> Your Inland may not be high enough for you to really harnass it
[3:51:08] <penitentpendant> 6 Inland, 6 Shivers = Psychic cop!

[3:51:43] <vadnhi> @Menitta As part of a represtaion of your fear-response, isn't Half-Light - in a way - your 'cward stat'?
[3:51:43] <Ravioli_Ronin> I love this game so much
[3:51:45] <dukenux> I'm disco!
[3:51:47] <+krispen_wa> @ReallyBigRocks it makes sense with her character
[3:51:48] <Zap_Rowsdower32> DISCO
[3:51:51] <reonome> youre old
[3:51:55] <5pencer1001> how do you do fellow corpos
[3:51:59] <+OblivionSword1> DISCO BABY
[3:52:11] <%Juriasu> yeah you are
[3:52:11] <+Kataguro> This is Otacon explaining the world to you in MGS1
[3:52:13] <Ravioli_Ronin> Boomer cop
[3:52:13] <%SilvaChariot0133> This is an ordeal yeah
[3:52:15] <penitentpendant> @vadnhi Though it helps you observe the fear in others, which is helpful
[3:52:18] <Visorak6> Take your time its fine
[3:52:20] <Bootkiller6> Thank goodness you have your rent money already
[3:52:20] <cumurasame> Yeah talking to Joyce takes a while but is SUPER worth it... especially the thoughts you gain from it.
[3:52:24] <+ReallyBigRocks> reality LOWDOWN
[3:52:35] <reonome> hot
[3:52:39] <derap41> More Drugged up kids these days
[3:52:57] <%doomerskeletor13> The reeds huh
[3:52:58] <+krispen_wa> RIGHT
[3:53:02] <TheRealGreaterGamer> She's just that smart and nice
[3:53:06] <derap41> Joyce is very wordly
[3:53:07] <servicesuspension> exposition is hard
[3:53:07] <%Juriasu> she's rich so she knows things
[3:53:10] <penitentpendant> "Let our Narrator have a break."
[3:53:10] <LunarRemix> No it makes sense when you learn more about later
[3:53:11] <spaceitaly> she's got high shivers
[3:53:14] <+Kataguro> She's learned and has seen a lot of shit
[3:53:15] <%hax_metatron> She's rich so she has time and knows things
[3:53:15] <dukenux> She's just reminiscing like an old person
[3:53:17] <cutemuteprude> The NPC that GM uses to explain the game world
[3:53:23] <jorniev> MIGHT WANT TO begin internalizing thoughts you are gonna be here a while
[3:53:24] <derap41> Its called Nostalgia
[3:53:25] <+yusefHD> Woolie Liiikes Joooooyyyyce üé∂
[3:53:27] <Victory_Boss> she's just horny
[3:53:27] <+DenpaDev> She just an old lady regailing to a drunk person who asked
[3:53:27] <%Exiliator> People are often not what you expect
[3:53:30] <servicesuspension> maybe she read it something
[3:53:30] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Joyce also has good reason to know all this
[3:53:32] <servicesuspension> somewhere
[3:53:36] <5pencer1001> she has an infinite authority stat
[3:53:42] <+krispen_wa> so what we're saying is...kill all the knowledgeable people because they're rich and capitalist enough to gain knowledge!
[3:53:43] <LunarRemix> It makes sense when you learn her backstory later on, there's a reasons she's humoring you
[3:53:46] <vadnhi> Considering the effect that Shivers has on your own character, Woolie, you *MAY* not be that far off on your assment, at that.
[3:54:07] <+Kataguro> Oh Reggie's going to be SHOOK later
[3:54:12] <dukenux> Perfect habitat for an ANCIENT REPTILIAN BRAIN
[3:54:13] <%Juriasu> oh yeah he is
[3:54:14] <+HotBloodedHero> You ever sometimes feel possessed by the narator?
[3:54:18] <+yusefHD> Have you ever had a dream's' that you've uh um
[3:54:19] <%Exiliator> YES
[3:54:19] <Bootkiller6> Yup
[3:54:21] <derap41> Pomme de puree
[3:54:23] <+yusefHD> Oui
[3:54:23] <+Kataguro> Absolutely
[3:54:25] <Queqs_> No, its about the same
[3:54:27] <penitentpendant> It's one of the weirder turns of being multilingual
[3:54:30] <dukenux> Omelette du Fromage
[3:54:33] <andre11dr> No ,cause i know Latin
[3:54:34] <TrueSatanos> omelette du fromage
[3:54:34] <twohitgood> it's knowing how the sausage is made.
[3:54:35] <+OblivionSword1> not with french but I know what Woolie means
[3:54:36] <+Jiggisnipe> well it's like how Japanese use English nonsense
[3:54:37] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> I don't know French at all, it always sounds like Drunk speak to me, not fancy
[3:54:37] <+DenpaDev> Ask the japanese that need to go to rehab after visiting france
[3:54:37] <+pupil31> Omelette du Fromage Kreygasm
[3:54:43] <derap41> Its Au Fromage
[3:54:44] <servicesuspension> I thought Raccoon City sounded so *cool* until I learned English D;
[3:54:44] <laguerrilha> I mean in certain countries english is intelectual
[3:54:47] <vadnhi> THAT'S ALL YOU CAN SAY! :D
[3:54:47] <5pencer1001> but you get the "im smart" jolt when you already know what it mean before its explained
[3:54:49] <%SilvaChariot0133> How do you feel about seeing English in Japanese games?
[3:54:50] <+MrAtheGreat> yooo I hope I;m not too late
[3:54:50] <%Exiliator> Thats why subs > dubs
[3:54:52] <cutemuteprude> Also fun fact, the city of Revachol is named after Ravachol, a pen name of a French anarchist poet
[3:54:53] <+OblivionSword1> that's me with German
[3:54:55] <Bootkiller6> It's like when you guys played Yakuza Like a Dragon and you had the mysterious Korean
[3:54:59] <%hax_metatron> Bakamitai?
[3:55:03] <Ravioli_Ronin> I‚Äôm not a French speaker, and I don‚Äôt view French as exotic or fancy LUL
[3:55:05] <WakeUpThrow> I think it still feels fancy, even if you know the words
[3:55:06] <Prevot> tia good part p√© speaking a different romance language is only kinda knowing what French words mean
[3:55:07] <+senfood> Oh rad, he's talking to Joyce.
[3:55:09] <cutemuteprude> So it's a REALLY French game
[3:55:10] <Estwilde> Like how rudimentary english words are used extravagantly in Japanese?
[3:55:12] <WakeUpThrow> Not AS fancy, but still
[3:55:13] <Chatterbox1991> @WoolieVersus well think about how prestigious and fancy the "English" language was supposed to be once upon a time?
[3:55:13] <dukenux> it's au fromage

[3:57:48] <laguerrilha> She is rich and 2 weeks stuck there
[3:57:48] <+Jiggisnipe> maybe she likes to talk :)
[3:57:50] <vadnhi> ..Or she wants your Drunken, middle aged Commie D. :P
[3:57:51] <linSP> she‚Äôs disco
[3:57:51] <+pupil31> Maybe it's because you're the police
[3:57:52] <dukenux> OR she's baiting info out of you

[3:58:16] <%ppangboi> "beyond patriotism" is such a phrase
[3:58:24] <penitentpendant> Was it on Rock and Roll?
[3:58:30] <%nicversus> there's a reason when you type in "Disco Elysium" into google search, the first suggested result is "Disco Elysium Joyce"
[3:58:31] <spaceitaly> imagine having the opportunity to explain the world to an amnesiac
[3:58:32] <Crippl3> god I love this shit
[3:58:33] <dukenux> Isn't "beyond patriotism" just nationalism
[3:58:33] <+Kataguro> Well it was a monarchy, so no
[3:58:36] <+ReallyBigRocks> MRG doesn't have the same ring to it
[3:58:36] <+za7az> LUL
[3:58:40] <5pencer1001> was it built with rock and roll?

[3:59:37] <aiutare47> America baby!
[3:59:37] <+AbnormalVoid> it's essentially the same as real life
[3:59:40] <+OblivionSword1> You'll get it Woolie
[3:59:41] <+yusefHD> Map LUL
[3:59:43] <TrueSatanos> I'd kill for a map of this game's world
[3:59:57] <spaceitaly> someone made rough version of this world's map
[4:00:01] <+AbnormalVoid> it's very much an analogue for the real world
[4:00:08] <cutemuteprude> Occidentals are white people
[4:00:08] <andre11dr> There is a map
[4:00:09] <servicesuspension> put all these extremists here like a political danganronpa
[4:00:10] <vadnhi> We named that Century that when that crazy mad scientist and his hip teenage sidekick came back in their time-machine car to visit it.
[4:00:14] <Indigo_Automaton> @TrueSatanos I want more games set in this world
[4:00:19] <+yusefHD> @TrueSatanos There's one someone put in the game subreddit once - I'd say google it
[4:00:20] <5pencer1001> the primordial soup of ideology
[4:00:22] <iacus_> occidental = european
[4:00:24] <dukenux> Occidental just means western no
[4:00:25] <iacus_> sorta
[4:00:34] <+dolresdei> Occident litrrally just means west
[4:00:40] <+MrAtheGreat> occi = whities
[4:00:43] <Crippl3> @Indigo_Automaton there's a novel that came before the game, but it's not translated to english :(
[4:00:45] <+dolresdei> ie the opposite of Orient
[4:00:52] <+krispen_wa> Idealogical Royal Rumble, winner gets to point at the Wrestlemania sign
[4:00:59] <andre11dr> Occidental is the European people, aka us
[4:01:03] <servicesuspension> they were going to translate the novel, but I think covid delayed it
[4:01:05] <Darren716> That's what the size of Indonesia?
[4:01:07] <+ReallyBigRocks> @Crippl3 I think a translation is coming
[4:01:07] <Bootkiller6> Right, this is a fictional world
[4:01:10] <+AbnormalVoid> it is similar to our world in that respect as well
[4:01:16] <TheRealGreaterGamer> West of WHAT basically is the issue
[4:01:18] <Bootkiller6> so what does "western" mean here
[4:01:20] <+Vigonept> oh cool
[4:01:21] <5pencer1001> it could mean the exact opposite
[4:01:22] <iacus_> the term in the game roughly suggest analogues to the real world, even if it's fantasy
[4:01:25] <Johannen> MeasureHead called you Occidental
[4:01:28] <aiutare47> Its the Idea of an old world
[4:01:29] <+krispen_wa> Dig West, stupid
[4:01:32] <Crippl3> @ReallyBigRocks yeah, but I want it NOW raysA
[4:01:35] <+TONYOO101> be aware that the world is different to ours, seol, where kim's family is from, is west from here
[4:01:37] <Queqs_> same thing on earth, why do americans call asia the east?
[4:01:39] <+ReallyBigRocks> Basically your second point Woolie
[4:01:40] <%nicversus> Woolie's saying "occidental" has a cultural context specific to our world, so it's weird to see it in fictional worlds
[4:01:42] <jorniev> the guy who created this setting is pretty good at it
[4:01:44] <ingman112> It‚Äôs basically ‚Äúwhite-looking.‚Äù We‚Äôll get there
[4:01:47] <5pencer1001> this game invites a bit of big head naval gazing
[4:01:49] <TheRetrorrificMan> Occidental mainly means what it means in our world when you say "western civilization"
[4:01:49] <vadnhi> Oh. If that much is futzing with your thought patterns, you haven't seen *ANYTHING* yet, Woolie.
[4:01:51] <aiutare47> sol-der ing iron
[4:01:53] <aiutare47> I hate that
[4:01:57] <+senfood> oh god, you're in Jersey
[4:01:57] <LlewynMarie> we would understand the analog as western
[4:01:59] <derap41> Shit we're in upstate newyork
[4:02:03] <%nicversus> but then this world seems based on our world so it seems to make sense
[4:02:06] <Crippl3> god I can not WAIT for some of the later stuff
[4:02:07] <aiutare47> @derap41 fucking terrifying
[4:02:09] <servicesuspension> we're not retro, we're just poor :(

[4:05:22] <penitentpendant> @TheRealGreaterGamer It's one of the better ones. Wompty Dompty Dom Center can be good for high INT builds
[4:05:23] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Which one gives exp when you click orbs?
[4:05:24] <DSD24> You got a point
[4:05:26] <5pencer1001> wompty and art cop are godliek as well
[4:05:27] <+AbnormalVoid> probably not important Kappa
[4:05:34] <derap41> Really need more cabinet slots
[4:05:36] <%Juriasu> you have a skill point to unlock a cabinet slot
[4:05:38] <%DiscoMatador> That one is Supper GOOD
[4:05:38] <+OblivionSword1> even the game is telling you to internalize this
[4:05:39] <+Kataguro> This one
[4:05:39] <+za7az> NotLikeThis
[4:05:42] <andre11dr> Shit ,i totally missed that one
[4:05:44] <Crippl3> Gotta buy more cabinet slots
[4:05:45] <TheRealGreaterGamer> GET
[4:05:46] <ingman112> You can and should unlock a slot
[4:05:46] <cutemuteprude> Unlock a thought slot!
[4:05:46] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @aiutare47 oh damn, i bet
[4:05:47] <$JobbedBone> BibleThump
[4:05:48] <TrueSatanos> This one's worth spending a skill point to get the cabinet slot.
[4:05:51] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @TheRealGreaterGamer the one he just read
[4:05:51] <Queqs_> the main character REBELLING against his game amnesia. i love it
[4:05:51] <+krispen_wa> use a skill point
[4:05:53] <%nicversus> hodor?
[4:05:54] <oda_flobunaga> Metal Gear?
[4:05:55] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Yeah, this one gives you EXP for each clicked orb
[4:06:00] <%DiscoMatador> You gotta do that one man
[4:06:03] <cumurasame> @andre11dr play again, it's super important to the world in the game
[4:06:06] <%DiscoMatador> Its too good
[4:06:07] <TheRealGreaterGamer> We're gonna be rich
[4:06:08] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[4:06:08] <+UnderseaMagic> 3 thought run
[4:06:10] <%JustToWatch> spend the point and get the slot, it's more important than any check redo
[4:06:12] <Johannen> weeb shit
[4:06:20] <cutemuteprude> Goddamit Woolie LUL
[4:06:26] <aiutare47> @Reverend_Roscoe Vaccinated, so im living, but a lot of folks are still stuck inside. Its a bitch, certainly no open space like upstate.
[4:06:26] <vadnhi> Ahh. Here's Woolz' goes again, with the Guilty Gear lore...
[4:06:36] <TrueSatanos> Honestly it's worth cheating to unlock all the thought cabinet slots. I don't like that they're locked.
[4:06:36] <dukenux> game says "take your pace"
[4:06:41] <5pencer1001> no time limit on anything
[4:06:43] <+MrAtheGreat> If you forget a thought it's free to replace it with another
[4:06:46] <+ReallyBigRocks> I want to know it all NOW
[4:06:47] <andre11dr> @cumurasame I am planning on playing it again, there's so much versatility to it
[4:06:49] <LunarRemix> You can ask everything right now, you don't have to leave
[4:06:49] <+yusefHD> YEP
[4:06:53] <derap41> She hasn't told you anything Woolioe
[4:06:54] <+yusefHD> Good catch Woolz
[4:06:54] <TrueSatanos> This is the one time I'd disagree with Kim.
[4:06:55] <Bootkiller6> yeah, we're still in "where are we"
[4:06:56] <trickster721> I'd like to publicly apologize for doubting Woolie, it turns out he was entirely correct and I was wrong.
[4:06:57] <TrueSatanos> Unless you need a breather
[4:06:57] <laguerrilha> There is a lot more
[4:06:58] <%doomerskeletor13> You don‚Äôt have to listen to Kim
[4:07:01] <+ALazo> this lady has so much dialogue
[4:07:02] <servicesuspension> I want to know NOW
[4:07:04] <+Sir_Louis> There is so much with joyce
[4:07:06] <LunarRemix> You can just do it all in one sitting, you don't have to leave
[4:07:08] <%jepupu> You did
[4:07:09] <dukenux> You don't have to
[4:07:10] <vadnhi> Joyce *IS* the World Info-Dump of this game. :P
[4:07:10] <trickster721> There is valid, peer-reviewed, government-funded scientific evidence that being a religious vegetarian makes you healthier and extends your lifespan.
[4:07:11] <+PkSilent01> Theres still more Woolie
[4:07:16] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @aiutare47 I'm near Cuse, it's not awful here
[4:07:18] <cumurasame> BTW people who said going Balanced is bad? You're right for Early Game but once you get some good items I'd say it's better long term
[4:07:20] <+MrAtheGreat> maybe get that thought first
[4:07:22] <TheRealGreaterGamer> FUCK KIM GET KNOWLEDGE
[4:07:23] <vadnhi> She's your Lore-Lady.
[4:07:26] <%Juriasu> this is a branch from that first screen
[4:07:30] <+OblivionSword1> you can ask her anytime woolie
[4:07:32] <dukenux> Nah
[4:07:34] <derap41> You've talked to her for like an hour and she hasn't told you anything she is amazing
[4:07:38] <Johannen> Game is calling you out
[4:07:39] <5pencer1001> no eat it now
[4:07:44] <TrueSatanos> Joyce is always there.
[4:07:46] <+za7az> @trickster721 That may be true, but.... FUCK THAT SHIT! psaDab
[4:07:48] <%nicversus> all the voices just start chanting "content, content, conTENT, CONTENT, CONTENT, CONTENT"
[4:07:50] <TrueSatanos> You can take breaks
[4:07:52] <Bootkiller6> they're stupid large
[4:07:56] <cumurasame> finish Jamais Vu before trying those white checks
[4:08:02] <trickster721> @trickster721 No, Woolie was right, and it's too late to take it back.
[4:08:04] <+ReallyBigRocks> What is *this*
[4:08:13] <Zap_Rowsdower32> You can talker without Kim
[4:08:13] <iacus_> it's probably better for Content to break it down with other tasks for now
[4:08:15] <+ReallyBigRocks> Gestures vaguely at everything
[4:08:15] <oda_flobunaga> What are THOOSE?
[4:08:15] <%DiscoMatador> Jamais Vu might help with those white checks
[4:08:16] <sendart> really gotta internalize that thought
[4:08:17] <Zap_Rowsdower32> *talk
[4:08:21] <TrueSatanos> Joyce doesn't even go to sleep, you can ALWAYS speak to her
[4:08:28] <Eger007> I got the BROTHER BY THIS POINT
[4:08:28] <laguerrilha> you can keep talking to her about reality if you want
[4:08:30] <andre11dr> Dude there's so much missable stuff in this game, it's insane
[4:08:31] <+OblivionSword1> Woolie you might want to internalize Jamais Vu
[4:08:33] <derap41> F1 F2 and F3
[4:08:34] <%DiscoMatador> Jamais Vu it Up Fam
[4:08:38] <+senfood> Jamais Vu now, dude.
[4:08:39] <+MrAtheGreat> Be aware that there are time limits for certain things (I think), and chatting causes the clock to tick
[4:08:45] <penitentpendant> Much was gained! Won a few red checks too!
[4:08:46] <+Vigonept> wait how low is his conceptualization for it to be 3%
[4:08:49] <+Sir_Louis> Get your Jamais vu'd
[4:08:49] <aiutare47> oh yeah Jamais should start now
[4:08:51] <+krispen_wa> Jaymay Voo
[4:08:55] <zanzibarian_hamster> Internalise the vu
[4:08:56] <Crippl3> @Vigonept it's a really hi check
[4:08:56] <+yusefHD> NO!
[4:08:59] <Zap_Rowsdower32> There's only a hard time limit for one sidequest
[4:09:01] <%DashXero> DashXero subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months! 'Enjoying the stream.
[4:09:01] <andre11dr> Like the hole Cunoese story, just fucking missable
[4:09:03] <penitentpendant> Pay off your rent?
[4:09:04] <dukenux> You been to the south?
[4:09:05] <5pencer1001> the only time limit is that you have to keep paying for your room each night
[4:09:06] <oda_flobunaga> Body?
[4:09:06] <+HotBloodedHero> Jamais vu it up
[4:09:07] <ingman112> Should definitely check out the body again as well, now that you have shit compressor
[4:09:12] <@Menitta> lmao when I read the phrase "Jamais vu" I think of MGSV

[4:09:35] <vadnhi> Yeah. It's one thing to *say* you can get through this game with any thought combination, but "Jamais Vu" and "The Thirteenth Indotribe" are SO EFFING GOOD it's hard to do without them.

[4:12:09] <aiutare47> CORRECT
[4:12:11] <oda_flobunaga> correct
[4:12:13] <AvroEltz> or forget
[4:12:15] <+yusefHD> Oh glass canon headass. Endurance!
[4:12:16] <+MrAtheGreat> You've got twelve thought slots, once it's full you've got to spend to respec
[4:12:16] <iacus_> take jamais vu and 15th indotribe
[4:12:16] <+OblivionSword1> that is correct
[4:12:16] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:12:16] <+senfood> Jamais Vu Fromage
[4:12:18] <TheRealGreaterGamer> OR Forget thoughts that take up space
[4:12:19] <SomeAsianDood> Jamais vu is super important
[4:12:20] <Bootkiller6> both of those thoughts are really really worth it
[4:12:21] <penitentpendant> Exp is VALUABLE
[4:12:26] <Ids560> you can also use the point to forget something you've internalized
[4:12:30] <%DiscoMatador> That thought Is so important I would almost say just use it
[4:12:30] <tattleworm> fifteenth indotribe is a great money maker
[4:12:30] <andre11dr> Hmmm ,there seems to be a homeless person screaming outside my window, wtf
[4:12:31] <+SignScratch> jamais is really worth it
[4:12:31] <Blank9> max out thought slots is good
[4:12:32] <penitentpendant> (Though not THAT limited)
[4:12:33] <+PkSilent01> it isn't shared
[4:12:33] <+Vigonept> bank it till you need it
[4:12:33] <TheRealGreaterGamer> INTERNALIZE JAMES KAPPA
[4:12:36] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Kappa
[4:12:37] <oda_flobunaga> nah
[4:12:38] <%cobalt_phoenix_> that's why jamais is so important
[4:12:38] <Indigo_Automaton> Jamais VU is super useful
[4:12:39] <+admiral_of_crunch> Exp is the best currency
[4:12:40] <zanzibarian_hamster> Thoughts are more important than skills, usully
[4:12:43] <+Jeshk0> its fine youll get plenty of skill points
[4:12:43] <Broand> It's still only Day 1
[4:12:45] <sendart> the thoughts also boost stats
[4:12:47] <aiutare47> Jamais Vu and Indotribe are good thoughts, but Jamais is more useful
[4:12:47] <tackelmacain> Slots are always bettter
[4:12:48] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @andre11dr hobocop irl?
[4:12:48] <vadnhi> @senfood Jamais AU Fromage...
[4:12:48] <%hax_metatron> You get tons of skill points
[4:12:53] <derap41> remember stats are just bonus points to a dice roll
[4:12:55] <Louie_Salmon> You end up with a lot of EXP, you'll have plenty.
[4:12:56] <oda_flobunaga> not really, if you get the right thoughts
[4:12:56] <cutemuteprude> Communism and Jamais Vu will both give you tons of xp
[4:12:57] <dustworthmain> you get alot of points though
[4:13:02] <AvroEltz> Woolie, you will get a lot of points if you do your tasks
[4:13:05] <servicesuspension> there's ways to raise the caps, and stats are also upgraded with equipment
[4:13:05] <spaceitaly> your brain is buy2play
[4:13:06] <Blank9> equipment and thoughts also give stats
[4:13:06] <superchunk121> You get a lot of points
[4:13:07] <DingusMcBaseball> shit compressor??
[4:13:11] <+AWKWARDL0SER> Forgetting thoughts ALSO cost points
[4:13:12] <+senfood> @vadnhi LUL
[4:13:15] <UnfilteredComic> Thoughts give skill points usually
[4:13:15] <+Vigonept> thoughts can increase stats
[4:13:15] <+krispen_wa> You level up A LOT
[4:13:16] <ingman112> Thoughts often provide stat boosts
[4:13:16] <+OblivionSword1> you'll get more skill points later
[4:13:18] <+MrAtheGreat> Problem is that you could get REALLLLLY GOOD thoughts or okay ones, you generally want to spend on thoughts tho I've fopund
[4:13:24] <+admiral_of_crunch> You'll max out the thought cabinet. It's real good.
[4:13:26] <%andrewofbob> Some thoughts will alter skill values
[4:13:26] <andre11dr> It's still just day 1 and it's not even past 22:00 yet
[4:13:28] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus You get exp from some thoughts too! Always prioritize learning new ones!!!!
[4:13:30] <Indigo_Automaton> Forgetting and Unlocking a new slot both cost 1 point
[4:13:31] <DiscoMatador> You could stop progress on Apococop
[4:13:33] <Broand> The compressor is useful until you get the body down
[4:13:35] <ingman112> Do not forget a thought until you
[4:13:39] <5pencer1001> not all thought are created equal
[4:13:39] <Blank9> thoughts are good
[4:13:40] <oda_flobunaga> thought cabinet slots are better over all
[4:13:40] <derap41> Slots are way better stats its just extra points to dice rolls
[4:13:40] <Bootkiller6> some thoughts increase skills, so they can be objectively better than putting the point directly into a skill
[4:13:42] <dustworthmain> not all thoughts are useful
[4:13:45] <+UnderseaMagic> unlock all the slots
[4:13:45] <+Kataguro> You get a lot of exp
[4:13:49] <LunarRemix> You'll unlock every single thought cabinet by the end of the gmae
[4:13:50] <SomeAsianDood> Thoughts are usually better
[4:13:51] <+xTJPBQdfNHA7qUxeTd5Uy9gV> thoughts are on average better but you may not know what they do until you are done
[4:13:54] <sendart> Jamais vu is very important
[4:13:54] <LunarRemix> You get a lot of exp too
[4:13:55] <ingman112> Never forget a thought until you‚Äôve gotten all the slots
[4:13:56] <+Vigonept> everyother one worked for me
[4:13:56] <Bootkiller6> the key is that you won't know what a thought does until you internalize it
[4:13:58] <aiutare47> JAMAIS
[4:13:58] <TheRealGreaterGamer> There are thoughts that are objectively awful and some that are too good lmao
[4:14:00] <Broand> Jamais vu!
[4:14:02] <TheRealGreaterGamer> JAMAIS
[4:14:02] <5pencer1001> the game should let you see what a researched thought would provide, you have to metagame it
[4:14:05] <aiutare47> Do that first
[4:14:06] <zedravan> jamais vu
[4:14:06] <linSP> Jamais vu is best taken earlier because of the extra exp it gives
[4:14:07] <+OblivionSword1> get Jamais Vu
[4:14:08] <Ids560> commie is also good
[4:14:09] <Indigo_Automaton> JAMAIS VU
[4:14:14] <Indigo_Automaton> Sick
[4:14:16] <%cobalt_phoenix_> we in boys
[4:14:20] <+OblivionSword1> hell yeah
[4:14:21] <+yusefHD> WACK
[4:14:22] <derap41> Commie is boring
[4:14:22] <+pupil31> LUL
[4:14:22] <+admiral_of_crunch> Shit Compressor is a thought that's better missed until you're rolling with low natural endurance.

[4:14:30] <+OblivionSword1> yeah that's fine
[4:14:31] <+Jiggisnipe> good alot people do already
[4:14:32] <+admiral_of_crunch> *unless
[4:14:34] <cumurasame> We're not trying to backseat game but Jamais Vu is the most important thought, it's a travesty to miss it, for real
[4:14:34] <%DiscoMatador> If a thought Isn't Done you can Stop it without using a point
[4:14:41] <+MrAtheGreat> Extreme thoughts are generally better than regular ones
[4:14:42] <linSP> yeet communism is not done yet
[4:14:42] <Louie_Salmon> It's actually not a great thought, so that's fine
[4:14:43] <+Jiggisnipe> Pat is being commie if people want commie
[4:14:49] <twohitgood> internalized thoughts also affect dialogs and interactions, not just stats.
[4:14:49] <%JustToWatch> you get bonus xp for that thought
[4:14:50] <+yusefHD> You can be a full on incel in this lmfao
[4:14:53] <5pencer1001> cop of the apocolypse is not permanent yet
[4:14:55] <tackelmacain> You get a lot of skillpoints
[4:14:57] <%cobalt_phoenix_> you probably won't get every thought either
[4:14:58] <servicesuspension> oh right, you can remove a thought that's not finished cooking
[4:14:58] <derap41> Items give stats too
[4:15:01] <+Kataguro> You get a lot of exp
[4:15:04] <twoto858> The game is definitely generous
[4:15:07] <Bootkiller6> As long as you keep talking with everyone the game will dump a lot of exp on you
[4:15:07] <+MrAtheGreat> the game gives you A TOOOOOOON OF EXP
[4:15:07] <+Vigonept> it does
[4:15:11] <+Trask07> you get shitloads of points
[4:15:13] <cumurasame> I'm a lil disappointed the game goes Monarchist = Fascist though
[4:15:13] <%hax_metatron> SO MUCH EXP + POINTS
[4:15:14] <Crippl3> Completing tasks gives tons of XP
[4:15:15] <+za7az> The game is *very* generous
[4:15:15] <5pencer1001> end game you get limited by caps more than points
[4:15:15] <%DiscoMatador> If a thought Isn't Done you can Stop it without using a point and keep your progress
[4:15:17] <+Mendin> The game is fairly generous
[4:15:17] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus You basically just keep internalizing new thoughts while getting rid of the least desirable ones
[4:15:17] <oda_flobunaga> depends on how you think about things
[4:15:18] <zedravan> you can slightly boost stats with the clothes
[4:15:19] <jorniev> well you are gonna end up comitting to something THANK YOU final cut
[4:15:25] <Bootkiller6> You won't be able to max everything out, but you can still build as you like
[4:15:29] <+MrAtheGreat> I'm nearing the end (i think) and I've leveled maybe thirty times
[4:15:29] <resloxxx> its is Generous @WoolieVersus You are still on day 1 relax
[4:15:34] <SomeAsianDood> The game is very generous IF you lock in a political idealogy/copotype early
[4:15:34] <penitentpendant> Joyce (Phase 1)

[4:21:02] <+Reverend_Roscoe> BIG RED
[4:21:05] <Chatterbox1991> Red'ggie
[4:21:13] <penitentpendant> Red G, for the motherland!
[4:21:21] <andre11dr> This man has went for a plethora of stats
[4:21:29] <Chatterbox1991> @WoolieVersus im trying to go Moralist Fascist Feminist Sorry Cop
[4:21:32] <+SignScratch> fuck off choose
[4:21:33] <derap41> Super Moralist hated by all loved by themselves
[4:21:40] <andre11dr> Centrism is an option
[4:21:47] <5pencer1001> volition will save you
[4:21:49] <servicesuspension> Centrism is also shit on
[4:21:50] <+Jiggisnipe> well this game likes shitting on everything so have fun
[4:21:52] <+Promessa_EX> everyone is evil except the communists, they're stupid but the game respects them
[4:21:55] <+Trask07> moralist run incoming
[4:21:57] <penitentpendant> It's wonderfully ridiculous, high levels of Volition can sometimes gives you an out if you want it
[4:21:59] <+Jiggisnipe> I mean everything too
[4:22:00] <reonome> filthy fence sitters
[4:22:06] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Centrism is shit on THE MOST
[4:22:11] <%p4ntless> moralist is dead center in the shit zone
[4:22:11] <+Jiggisnipe> ^
[4:22:12] <%JustToWatch> lol just wait to see how this game treats centrists
[4:22:14] <5pencer1001> dont let yourself be bullied into opinions you dont actually beleive
[4:22:16] <SeniorTop> Definitely don't be afraid of failure, it can be incredibly entertaining. As long as you have healing items in your inventory, you won't get a fail state.
[4:22:18] <derap41> whatever choice you make its wrong
[4:22:18] <+illusiveSaint> !uptime
[4:22:18] <WakeUpThrow> It's a pretty level-headed way to approach it, tbf. Like a dirty CENTRIST
[4:22:18] <@Moobot> @illusiveSaint WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 4 hours and 35 minutes
[4:22:23] <dukenux> Boring Cop is discouraged
[4:22:28] <aiutare47> @Promessa_EX The Moralists are treated the same, not dumb, just too naive
[4:22:28] <+Vigonept> What was the star wars thing, indifference is death?
[4:22:29] <jorniev> I CAN'T WAIT woolie
[4:22:34] <Darkdrill> woolie vs Extreme ideas
[4:22:36] <andre11dr> Moralist just seemed like a lame option
[4:22:43] <jorniev> SURE WOOLIE
[4:22:44] <+yusefHD> >volition
[4:22:47] <+Jeshk0> The Kim Path is the True Path
[4:22:47] <derap41> a little racist a little gay a little socialist a little fascist
[4:22:48] <+SignScratch> that is a centrist argument
[4:22:48] <andre11dr> Like I'll go big
[4:22:51] <5pencer1001> the everything is shit thought is pretty potent
[4:22:51] <aiutare47> BASED
[4:22:52] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @vigonept apathy is death
[4:22:52] <+DenpaDev> The real question is what does kim believe?
[4:22:54] <%justcallmebobplease> That is ENTIRELY your volition, you foolin' yourself.
[4:22:59] <5pencer1001> woolie is actually art cop
[4:23:03] <reonome> volition is there for you woolie
[4:23:08] <+OblivionSword1> how about THE ULTRALIBERAL THO
[4:23:08] <Darkdrill> woolie secretly maxing volition with out knowing XD
[4:23:14] <jorniev> I got called all the systems in my game
[4:23:19] <+Jiggisnipe> he's a cool guy
[4:23:20] <+Vigonept> HES COOL AND A GOOD DUDE
[4:23:20] <derap41> Volition makes you super Dry
[4:23:24] <+SignScratch> your will
[4:23:25] <justcallmebobplease> NO
[4:23:25] <aiutare47> Its your willpower
[4:23:27] <jorniev> WILLPOWER
[4:23:28] <+Trask07> volition helps you keep your shit together
[4:23:28] <+yusefHD> think of it as "staying on topic"
[4:23:31] <servicesuspension> volition keeps you from being a mess
[4:23:31] <Johannen> Volition is you Willpower
[4:23:32] <Crippl3> Volition can also stop you from becoming a weirdo
[4:23:32] <gamewarden92> Willpower and self-control
[4:23:33] <Louie_Salmon> Just there to help out
[4:23:33] <+justianxix> Its the Get it done guy
[4:23:33] <+Mendin> Woolie is one or two choices away from his gut calling him Br√∂ther
[4:23:34] <Darkdrill> volition is the one that keeps you sane
[4:23:35] <derap41> makes you impossible to fuck up
[4:23:37] <vadnhi> Volition is the seat of your self-esteem.
[4:23:38] <+Ynkubus_> willpower/motivation
[4:23:38] <5pencer1001> volotion is you willpower, it lets you avoid being guilted into
[4:23:40] <+Vigonept> HES SMART
[4:23:40] <+UnderseaMagic> there's volition checks
[4:23:41] <servicesuspension> yeah
[4:23:41] <+yusefHD> Yeah
[4:23:42] <Ids560> yeah it's both
[4:23:42] <gamewarden92> Yes
[4:23:42] <Louie_Salmon> Essentially yeah
[4:23:43] <%kewlmyc> It does both
[4:23:43] <reonome> yeah
[4:23:44] <Darkdrill> yeah
[4:23:45] <jorniev> YOU CAN DO IT WOOLIE
[4:23:45] <+Promessa_EX> volition has like, pop offs
[4:23:46] <+SignScratch> it's your center kind of
[4:23:46] <+justianxix> Solve the case guy
[4:23:48] <penitentpendant> Volition is also your 'self control'. He can help you keep the other stats in control if they go off the rails without your permission
[4:23:49] <%TheTyper> Volition keeps your other stats from dominating you
[4:23:50] <5pencer1001> volition lets you bail out
[4:23:51] <Johannen> Its your mental spine
[4:23:52] <vadnhi> It's also the seat of your own sense of Agency
[4:23:53] <+Jiggisnipe> people like him as a personality and yes he's your mental health
[4:23:54] <+styptysat> It's how resist the other thoughts
[4:23:54] <WakeUpThrow> It is ALSO willpower
[4:23:57] <aiutare47> It forces you to uphold your self, have a sense of dignity, keep promises
[4:23:58] <andre11dr> Volition i just your power to deal with shit
[4:23:58] <+Vigonept> its your rock
[4:23:58] <enZymeth> Volition got you out of saying something fascist or communist with Rene
[4:23:58] <Ids560> Endurance also says things sometimes if it's higher
[4:23:59] <Blank9> let you ask for money too
[4:24:00] <+JustBlubs> It's both. It cares the most for your well being out of all the stats.
[4:24:00] <+OblivionSword1> Volition is what keep everyone of your stats in check
[4:24:01] <+yusefHD> Too much volition, but no empathy makes you steamroll folks for instance
[4:24:02] <derap41> high volition means you win but you're boring
[4:24:03] <5pencer1001> it let you bail out whne it told you to pick one or fuck off
[4:24:04] <chandlerofearth> Shivers is best skill.
[4:24:10] <andre11dr> It does a bunch of things
[4:24:10] <Louie_Salmon> Lots of stats do double-duty
[4:24:10] <+xTJPBQdfNHA7qUxeTd5Uy9gV> yes, it's the will to go on and your morale stat
[4:24:14] <%andrewofbob> Would Volition let you back out of the Carousel?
[4:24:17] <+Jiggisnipe> every stat is a person
[4:24:17] <%kewlmyc> Just like endurance, which is your health, volition also chimes in, and usually saves your ass from dumb decisions.
[4:24:18] <%cobalt_phoenix_> it does
[4:24:19] <+illusiveSaint> exactly, it's mentions things face value like Kim
[4:24:19] <aiutare47> Same with endurance
[4:24:20] <+Vigonept> yes it has uses
[4:24:23] <%DashXero> I've been playing boring cop.
[4:24:25] <+OblivionSword1> Volition ikeep everyone of your stats in check
[4:24:28] <WakeUpThrow> Like the game says, Volition keeps you together
[4:24:31] <%TheTyper> Without volition you're at the mercy of your other skills
[4:24:35] <spaceitaly> volition, inland, shivers, and esprit de corps are all fan favourites
[4:24:37] <andre11dr> Endurance is the same, it does more than just being health @woolieversus
[4:24:38] <+SignScratch> yours is too low
[4:24:39] <penitentpendant> It's too low level
[4:24:39] <+Vigonept> ya gotta raise em
[4:24:41] <+justianxix> you need it higher
[4:24:41] <Ids560> yeah 3 is not consistent for showing up
[4:24:43] <%kyh9> You need to pump Shivers higher
[4:24:43] <%cobalt_phoenix_> yours is too low
[4:24:45] <+Trask07> if you level it shivers will show up all the time
[4:24:47] <+yusefHD> Not much to get shivery about m8
[4:24:47] <+OblivionSword1> you have too low shivers
[4:24:47] <+illusiveSaint> shivers is world building need it higher
[4:24:48] <+Forente> gotta pump it
[4:24:48] <+Promessa_EX> you use all of it
[4:24:49] <%kyh9> Woolie, they all show up
[4:24:50] <%TheTyper> Shivers gets more intense at 5/6
[4:24:50] <+Vigonept> you see them if you dump into them
[4:24:52] <+Trask07> my shivers never shut up
[4:24:52] <jorniev> YOU WILL
[4:24:54] <Chatterbox1991> @WoolieVersus @WoolieVersus there's moments in the game where you other stats can be manipulated by external factors and your volution helps counteract that and keep you in control
[4:24:55] <%kyh9> Woolie, Shivers is pretty modest right now
[4:24:55] <%kewlmyc> Shivers is cool, but just like Encyclopedia, it never shuts the fuck up when it does talk.
[4:24:56] <+JustBlubs> You WILL see them if you dump into them
[4:24:57] <5pencer1001> shivers is the dmx stat
[4:24:57] <%Namillus> The more points you have in a stat the more it chimes in
[4:25:02] <vadnhi> There's a reason why Volition is represented as a *Crown*. it's the *King*
[4:25:03] <+illusiveSaint> if it's too low other stats will talk over it
[4:25:08] <+feign___> wouldn't worry too much
[4:25:09] <+UnderseaMagic> get better gear
[4:25:11] <%TheTyper> Body's not even down yet, YOU GOT TIME
[4:25:12] <aiutare47> you will see almost all stats a LOT if you arent seeing it, its because its not high enough
[4:25:13] <%kewlmyc> Gear
[4:25:13] <%DashXero> @5pencer1001 Too soon.
[4:25:14] <+MightyDuckShoes> doesn't he have Hobocop? you can get it to six
[4:25:17] <derap41> pump it with thoughts and items
[4:25:18] <%kyh9> Stop listening to narcs, pump it
[4:25:22] <+justianxix> you get enough points to do both
[4:25:22] <5pencer1001> if you pump it later, a lot of the missed checks may show up again
[4:25:23] <dmtjinni> dont save points, only save 1
[4:25:27] <jorniev> ITS THE CHOICE I guess
[4:25:28] <%kewlmyc> Gear and Thoughts
[4:25:28] <+SignScratch> yea, there's no min max objective way
[4:25:31] <+Vigonept> Do it how you want coward
[4:25:32] <servicesuspension> commit to an extreme!
[4:25:32] <+specters_art88> It has background checks and you don‚Äôt always see if you failed the check.
[4:25:32] <chandlerofearth> I'd put in a point or two into shivers, then modify it with clothes you'll get later.
[4:25:34] <Darkdrill> i bought the game just to its so great
[4:25:34] <Ids560> spend points on whatever you want, the game is fairly forgiving with regards to your build
[4:25:35] <+feign___> you'll be fine
[4:25:36] <+Promessa_EX> save "sometimes"
[4:25:36] <spaceitaly> pump shivers, open yourself to the world, see the city in your mind
[4:25:38] <%TheTyper> We're still on day 1, we have plenty of XP to go
[4:25:39] <derap41> Pump it with drugs
[4:25:39] <+justianxix> you can go either way
[4:25:39] <Louie_Salmon> You're only on day one, there's a LOT of game left
[4:25:39] <+MightyDuckShoes> pumpers love to pump. pumpers need to pump
[4:25:40] <AlastorThrice> the personality traits are like your RPG party members - you kind of have to pick your party composition
[4:25:42] <aiutare47> then dont play like that
[4:25:44] <%Namillus> Spend points on stuff and use clothes to tweak your stats for checks
[4:25:45] <SeniorTop> Just pump what is interesting to you, it's all very cool in one way or another.
[4:25:50] <+Jiggisnipe> do whatever, just make you don't die
[4:25:51] <+OblivionSword1> clothing also helps with stats
[4:25:53] <Estwilde> It'd be interesting to see a CheatEngine run with every stat jacked and see just how many stats perk up
[4:25:55] <andre11dr> Well, everytime you exist the Whirling in Rags, there's a hidden Shivers roll
[4:25:56] <+illusiveSaint> exactly Woolie, it's up to you to balance your wants
[4:25:56] <5pencer1001> dont worry about missing stuff, the game lets you go over again and again
[4:25:59] <%DashXero> Sadly, it couldn't boot.
[4:26:01] <+SignScratch> you're also still early in
[4:26:05] <aiutare47> @Estwilde Itd be near unplayble
[4:26:10] <%DashXero> I'm big disappointed.
[4:26:11] <+OblivionSword1> yeah Phantom Brigade
[4:26:15] <+Promessa_EX> i guess also don't just keep adding thought slots if you need stats
[4:26:18] <%DashXero> Both.
[4:26:30] <%DashXero> I think I need a new PC or something.
[4:26:30] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1386952720297381894?s=19
[4:26:55] <+Forente> Does playing with chat feel like the thought cabinet
[4:26:56] <%DashXero> I know! I was really looking forward to playing it!
[4:26:58] <andre11dr> @estwilde It would probably take too long to even do anything, since just the beginning has like 50 different rolls
[4:27:07] <+yusefHD> WHAT
[4:27:09] <+illusiveSaint> there's plenty of opportunity to level up with convo to unlock checks unless you prioritize it
[4:27:12] <Darkdrill> wait did i miss this ?
[4:27:12] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[4:27:15] <dmtjinni> WWHAT

[4:27:17] <Estwilde> @andre11dr @aiutare47 probably hehe
[4:27:19] <+Jiggisnipe> or is Reggie too pure
[4:27:20] <%andrewofbob> Conceptualisation
[4:27:23] <vadnhi> No No. You were imagining it right, Reggie. :P
[4:27:24] <+yusefHD> So speedrunning.
[4:27:25] <derap41> dick flattening
[4:27:30] <penitentpendant> Reggie Conceptualization - Success
[4:27:35] <aiutare47> Reggie didnt know about Sunday Friends though
[4:27:40] <Darkdrill> @derap41 that sounds like a power move

[4:27:43] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[4:27:44] <+yusefHD> LMFAO
[4:27:48] <+feign___> yes Reggie, just think about Sunday friend
[4:27:49] <+specters_art88> Nah Reggie didn‚Äôt get ‚ÄúSunday friend‚Äù failed the check
[4:27:50] <+pupil31> NEGATIVE EDGE
[4:27:58] <Darkdrill> XD
