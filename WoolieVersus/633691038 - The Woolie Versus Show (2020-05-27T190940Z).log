[0:04:14] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @doc_ock_rokc
[0:04:17] <%Bluemanzee> Woolie might try to start up another cult
[0:04:18] <DatAsuna> Scientology has a navy and that's pretty hilarious
[0:04:22] <dinnydanny777> But if your soldiers exist in the future it means your side won
[0:04:23] <Shade075> This is a podcast title in the making
[0:04:24] <Psyramics> You just say your religion blocks their conversion attempts even after death and tell 'em to fuck off
[0:04:28] <startstoprepeat> isn't that the plot of eternal champions
[0:04:30] <tranquilturnip> Neo EX Mormon
[0:04:34] <+Stupid121v2> holy shit the night walkers were mormons
[0:04:38] <TheFramedWarlock> EX Fighting Mormon
[0:04:38] <+doc_ock_rokc> The Kindel of Nomrom!
[0:04:39] <dinnydanny777> If you were on the losing side there wouldn't be soldiers left in the future
[0:04:46] <DSD24> Everything sounds cooler when you put Neo in front of it
[0:04:47] <%Livelinne> BibleThump

[0:04:49] <Doodle_Taco> MORMONS VS SKYNET PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[0:04:51] <%alpacasintophats> alternatively we can tie religion to the bloodline of someone who lived far enough in the past, that his bloodline likely exists in every human being until now
[0:04:54] <%krispen_wa> Wha happun to the game?
[0:04:54] <%Livelinne> Yay
[0:04:56] <+AjaxFoamingCleanser> audio is good
[0:04:59] <SiegeJay> IRS: Mormons, you need to increase your numbers or pay these taxes and shit
[0:05:00] <%GeneralSCPatton> Achron is a rad game where you can use soldiers from the future to defend the factories that will make them.
[0:05:02] <%JohnAtDawn> To be honest, the Catholic Church should be saddled with huge dept for all the reparations they should be made to pay.
[0:05:03] <%CozyGUNNA> Kreygasm Kreygasm

[0:05:44] <%alpacasintophats> It's free real estate
[0:05:57] <dinnydanny777> Someone somewhere is out there yelling "The Catholic Church did nothing wrong" you know it
[0:06:03] <luckysteak> It is always funny to see my religion being discussed
[0:06:04] <ingman112> Yo for real though, you gotta get rid of some saves
[0:06:07] <DatAsuna> this was the ritual they were talking about
[0:06:31] <dinnydanny777> The Balkans invaded Canada
[0:06:32] <%alpacasintophats> remains

[0:07:38] <derap41> OP god pls nerf
[0:07:43] <%Ashenik1> South Park knew it
[0:07:45] <dinnydanny777> The Catholic Church have definitely done things wrong for decades, there have been a lot of child abuse scandals involving catholic priests
[0:07:45] <%GeneralSCPatton> "You believed the wrong thing and are in Hell? Nah, I got you fam."
[0:07:47] <SiegeJay> INFINITE Morman WORKS!
[0:07:48] <tranquilturnip> The distant future past
[0:07:55] <DatAsuna> TFW you reach into the future but you hit a limit
[0:08:06] <dinnydanny777> What happens when you pull soldiers from the future and they just look like Doom enemies?
[0:08:08] <lotharrio> Soldier from five tomorrows.
[0:08:09] <+doc_ock_rokc> @WoolieVersus You religion is now Nomrom!
[0:08:10] <%gatorafan> Only thing left to do is to NEVER DIE daedra1DrunkTibs
[0:08:10] <luckysteak> You can't beat us, WOOLIE! We control the past and can change your future!
[0:08:12] <%Chatterbox1991> @WoolieVersus Mormons are basically the Borg
[0:08:16] <+HollowMan190> That's littarly the plot of kingdom hearts DDD and 3
[0:08:25] <luckysteak> THE FUTURE DOESN'T BELONG TO YOU
[0:08:27] <derap41> I mean there was a lot of berlin wall to go around
[0:08:37] <$Invlux> I wanna make a madoka joke about that concept but I'll abstain for Woolie's sake
[0:08:38] <AvailableThor> How about the power to convert yet-to-be-born future people? Transcendental Non-Linear Mormonism.
[0:08:43] <%Ashenik1> I love that we are talking cahtolic chursch pedophilia problem on chat while playing Star Wars game on stream
[0:08:44] <%DesertPenguin> First time watching, can someone give a quick recap of everything so far? LUL
[0:08:45] <dinnydanny777> You pull a soldier from the future and it's just like a demon from Doom
[0:08:45] <ralphfromdk> As in, they get punched by the jedi :p
[0:08:59] <ATPsoldat> It's a pretty slick armor to be honest
[0:09:18] <%Ashenik1> So far we are gathering harem for woolie character
[0:09:21] <DSD24> That's cool though
[0:09:22] <ralphfromdk> DesertPenguin Sith Bad, Jedi Dumb.... that's about it.
[0:09:25] <+GrassCannon> KOH Kreygasm
[0:09:27] <%Irridium> Revan (Nothing)
[0:09:27] <Redblood801> THAT'S RAD
[0:09:38] <%BallerSwagBro9k> IT WAS ME AUSTIN
[0:09:39] <DSD24> Can you imagine! you actually have no face?
[0:09:47] <+cmdrmobium> Is it like the missing face at the end of FF8?
[0:09:48] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[0:09:51] <+wunp_fxs> Set her behavior to grenadier if u want her to use them auto
[0:09:57] <%Ashenik1> exept Mira, Woolie hates redheads
[0:10:00] <Shade075> Revan took his mface...off
[0:10:03] <DSD24> @cmdrmobium Man that imagine is uncomfortable
[0:10:05] <DSD24> image
[0:10:17] <dinnydanny777> Looks like it does less damage than the gun
[0:10:18] <DatAsuna> they're good in the early game and that's about it
[0:10:24] <damienlunas> They scale very poorly
[0:10:42] <+oda_flobunaga> But she's just a badly realized character
[0:10:50] <AvailableThor> Don't hate on Mira, hate leads to the dark side,
[0:10:56] <muniea3> you'd hope for big splash damage at least
[0:11:00] <%Ashenik1> thats why they hate
[0:11:01] <SiegeJay> I am going to make a ton of people mad. Mira is still smarter than the whole Persona 5 cast
[0:11:13] <+GrassCannon> weird comparison to make
[0:11:28] <SiegeJay> Persona 5 cast are a bunch of morons
[0:11:29] <ATPsoldat> That's hard to justify given that she walking into a trap willingly
[0:11:32] <%CozyGUNNA> @siegejay LUL LUL
[0:11:37] <%CozyGUNNA> not wrong tho
[0:11:41] <AvailableThor> You what? Makoto and Futaba beat any of these characters in intelligence, and they are literal children.
[0:11:51] <DSD24> Never forget how dumb everyone was during the Okumura arc
[0:11:54] <notenoughgirls> in her defense exile's plan was also to walk into the trap willingly
[0:11:56] <ATPsoldat> Persona 5 cast are teenagers, what's Mira's excuse?
[0:12:05] <dinnydanny777> "I didn't want to become a Sith I just hated a character in a video game so much and then I woke up the next day and my lightsaber was now red"
[0:12:06] <Safarihat> the defel show up in timothy zahn novels
[0:12:10] <%Ashenik1> 14 months
[0:12:12] <notenoughgirls> exile is just more capable
[0:12:26] <DatAsuna> cause they put the pivot there
[0:12:29] <%PulsinFufu> clumsySip chat what characters would you like to see in season 5 of sfv?
[0:12:33] <Shade075> Reminder: Mira literally walked into the enemy hideout with NO plan and immediately got captured
[0:12:45] <DSD24> @PulsinFufu Makoto
[0:12:46] <ATPsoldat> @notenoughgirls taking over a dumb plan still makes you dumb.
[0:12:48] <ralphfromdk> Well, for combat, you want both hands spread out, not just in the middle of the handle
[0:12:52] <Redblood801> I keep seeing Timothy Zahn, but my brain keeps saying Tyber Zann
[0:12:53] <%CozyGUNNA> dudley or makoto
[0:12:56] <SiegeJay> @Shade075 Makoto did the same
[0:12:57] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus I'll add it to that alt scenes/hanharr video later if ya want
[0:13:07] <+oda_flobunaga> Also remember, Mira does not know what Wookies are
[0:13:09] <%PulsinFufu> there are 5 spots so makoto could be there inochiLOL
[0:13:20] <ATPsoldat> Makoto was also a teenager. Mira is a bounty hunter.
[0:13:24] <notenoughgirls> i mean yeah don't get me wrong i didn't say it wasnt dumb
[0:13:25] <Second_Omega> Just Joined Where we at?
[0:13:27] <%CozyGUNNA> any character from third strike tbh
[0:13:28] <dinnydanny777> Hanharr did nothing wrong
[0:13:28] <Manjove> TYBER ZAHN REPORTING
[0:13:29] <+kewlmyc> Poor Mira
[0:13:44] <DSD24> Hanharr hates life that's pretty wrong
[0:13:45] <megamirk> super advanced computer - a lever
[0:13:46] <megamirk> yes
[0:13:50] <muniea3> maff lever
[0:13:54] <AvailableThor> Hodor?
[0:14:00] <The_Nerd_Supreme> I'll do you one better, she beats Hanharr twice up to this point that we know of and all also saves his life on the first one.
[0:14:01] <DatAsuna> the ancient ritual of game crashing
[0:14:09] <%Zohare> @Second_Omega Sith temple on Dxun
[0:14:22] <DSD24> Force Clairvoyance?
[0:14:41] <lotharrio> He left his pen in his robe pocket.
[0:14:42] <Shade075> @SiegeJay As a lot of people mentioned she is a teenager while Mira is "apparently" one of the best bounty hunters around
[0:14:50] <+wunp_fxs> semantics
[0:14:54] <brachydios777> The Skywalkers did like wearing black
[0:14:59] <+cmdrmobium> Luke wears black so you think he'll turn to the dark side though
[0:15:01] <tranquilturnip> Anakin's is both dark brown and black I think
[0:15:05] <DatAsuna> anakin has like 3 hue and some black
[0:15:05] <DSD24> "My power has doubled since last time we met"
[0:15:08] <%BisoromiBear> they're the wrong color
[0:15:08] <notenoughgirls> what the vossk say about mira
[0:15:11] <SiegeJay> @Shade075 She is the only one who says she is the best
[0:15:12] <dinnydanny777> Luke wears black, just like his father
[0:15:12] <DatAsuna> not full black
[0:15:14] <notenoughgirls> iirc they never talked to vossk
[0:15:20] <brachydios777> Brown and black
[0:15:22] <%Chatterbox1991> i thought it was Black Leather?
[0:15:26] <ATPsoldat> @SiegeJay then it might be in her favor to act like one?
[0:15:34] <+cmdrmobium> Luke has black on the outside but white on the inside
[0:15:35] <tranquilturnip> the leather-ish vest is black but the robes under it are brown
[0:15:38] <DatAsuna> It's brown with a black toplayer
[0:15:40] <+cmdrmobium> Like many YourFace customers
[0:15:45] <muniea3> very subtle kojimbo
[0:15:45] <+GrassCannon> just checked, it is dark brown
[0:15:47] <%CozyGUNNA> i thought it was fully black
[0:16:05] <%Ashenik1> Yellow for Asian, Black for....
[0:16:08] <DatAsuna> aayla secura just hanging out not even trying to resemble robes
[0:16:12] <dinnydanny777> I think Luke is also the only hero who wears black, like his father and Sidious
[0:16:14] <DSD24> Speaking of Anakin remember how cool that Episode 3 game that came out?
[0:16:18] <Lefteron> pat is about to bust the door down and start bitching about the sand line
[0:16:20] <brachydios777> Black wirh brown on top
[0:16:21] <subjectg> so when they looked at mace windu, did they fear he would fall to the dark side immediately?
[0:16:41] <%CozyGUNNA> LUL
[0:16:51] <gerakiv> the sith armor is so shiny
[0:16:52] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:17:03] <dinnydanny777> If you were a Sith why would you agree to basically be cannon fodder
[0:17:21] <Fuji808> wait where's fannypack
[0:17:23] <%krispen_wa> because you'd be killed by your seupriors anyways
[0:17:24] <dinnydanny777> Wouldn't you just be like, "no"?
[0:17:27] <brachydios777> Sith usually look cooler than jedi
[0:17:30] <megamirk> Corpse (Nothing)
[0:17:32] <DSD24> He's at the palace I think?
[0:17:32] <lotharrio> @Fuji808 Doing his own thing.
[0:17:37] <%CozyGUNNA> agreed
[0:17:45] <%spiritofmojave> LUL
[0:17:46] <DSD24> I can barely hear them
[0:17:49] <subjectg> look at these MINIONS
[0:17:50] <%CozyGUNNA> luke probably has my favourite costume design in the movies tho
[0:17:55] <$tallik44123> because your boss will torture you to death
[0:17:55] <DatAsuna> cor blimey
[0:17:57] <dinnydanny777> Oh no, big frogs
[0:18:02] <%andrex2311> speak up
[0:18:03] <ATPsoldat> WE HAVE BEASTS.
[0:18:05] <%spiritofmojave> NO ONE CAN DEFEAT OUR SMALL GATORS
[0:18:05] <Joostebrood> lasers v big boars
[0:18:07] <tranquilturnip> I'm a genius! OH NO
[0:18:14] <Joostebrood> y i'll be betting on the boar things
[0:18:15] <%Irridium> @dinnydanny777 well, they'd probably be killed if they refused so eh. Damned if they do damned if they don't
[0:18:27] <akman14> Is the game audio a bit low or is it just me?
[0:18:32] <%ekodrop> so game audio still hasn't been increased
[0:18:34] <ATPsoldat> It's low
[0:18:34] <Parapattern> "Salt and Vinegar lightsaber, innit?"
[0:18:35] <dinnydanny777> How about saying you'd stop them and then just leaving?
[0:18:39] <%GeneralSCPatton> That is some tech
[0:18:44] <ralphfromdk> Yeah, game audio is low on our end again
[0:18:47] <dinnydanny777> "Yes I'll stop the Jedi" then just run
[0:19:03] <+oda_flobunaga> Yep
[0:19:16] <lotharrio> Is that the one with the giant rabbit person?
[0:19:19] <brachydios777> Yeah
[0:19:20] <%BallerSwagBro9k> BEAST RIDERS NANANANAANANA
[0:19:21] <dinnydanny777> I remember the star wars comic about the two Death Star employees
[0:19:28] <subjectg> tales of the jedi, yep
[0:19:29] <dinnydanny777> I forget what they were called
[0:19:42] <subjectg> tag and bink?
[0:19:50] <dinnydanny777> That sounds right
[0:19:51] <%CozyGUNNA> calling all beasts riders! lets ride!
[0:20:06] <Shade075> Remember the comic where a battle droid gained full sentience and abandoned the CIS army and became a farmer
[0:20:10] <DatAsuna> pretty sure it was dark horse comics not marvel
[0:20:20] <%GeneralSCPatton> Animals aren't made of Cortosis
[0:20:21] <lotharrio> A small army of animals would be good.
[0:20:25] <%Pillagius> Woolie, you remember stuff like Planet of the Apes?
[0:20:25] <%CozyGUNNA> spider riders was really a canadian classic
[0:20:39] <dinnydanny777> If you assembled an army of Rancors you would just be unstoppable
[0:20:40] <+doc_ock_rokc> @WoolieVersus The Dark side isn't easier its just faster and more seductive
[0:20:40] <%krispen_wa> are cannoks just God Eaters?
[0:20:41] <JetpackMcQuack> Jedi kill a lot of wildlife
[0:20:42] <%DashXero> I'd rather command an army of bears than an army of men.
[0:20:46] <%krispen_wa> *aragami
[0:20:53] <+cmdrmobium> Why is this sith officier such a damage sponge
[0:20:53] <subjectg> Animals are ferocious and expendable, if you could mind control them wouldn’t you?
[0:20:56] <Shade075> @CozyGUNNA To this day I STILL can't get that theme out of my head
[0:21:02] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Theres some massive creatures in Star Wars. If you could control them you'd have a huge edge
[0:21:11] <DatAsuna> yup
[0:21:18] <dinnydanny777> Never forget that Luke used to kill small animals with a star ship cannon for fun
[0:21:30] <+rider_megalon> Rember the Rancor
[0:21:39] <megamirk> KAR EN TUK time
[0:21:41] <subjectg> to be fair they were womp rats, and nobody liked those
[0:21:49] <+doc_ock_rokc> @dinnydanny777 and pest control
[0:21:50] <notenoughgirls> remember that big fucking space squid from solo
[0:21:51] <%Malik1002> this looks familiar
[0:21:53] <Shade075> To be fair wamp rats aren't exactly small
[0:21:57] <DatAsuna> multiple
[0:21:59] <notenoughgirls> i literally forgot it existed after the movie
[0:22:04] <huskarl_zap> the native guy
[0:22:06] <%krispen_wa> star wars has giant fuck-you starships, but people can't deal with pesky predators
[0:22:09] <DatAsuna> also plant jedi
[0:22:10] <huskarl_zap> from space
[0:22:16] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @rider_megalon Imagine being able to control a beast like that octo thing in Solo
[0:22:17] <gerakiv> Deus ex character
[0:22:23] <brachydios777> Eszra a little bit
[0:22:27] <gerakiv> worst part of rebels, no spoilers
[0:22:31] <+PhantomMiG> Sith to I think
[0:22:34] <dinnydanny777> What was the massive space monster thing from Episode V, I think?
[0:22:35] <$legacy0117> Or mind enslave a few Nergagigante from Monster Hunter and that'd be plenty. Or hell even Krayt Dragons, those exist in Star Wars universe.
[0:22:37] <%Pillagius> are Disney princesses actually Dark Jedi?
[0:22:53] <%Pillagius> forcing poor critters do their chores
[0:22:54] <%CozyGUNNA> yes cmonBruh
[0:22:54] <ralphfromdk> Did you even pick it up, or did you leave it on the floor
[0:23:06] <megamirk> not picked up probably, yes
[0:23:14] <megamirk> woolie did an oopie
[0:23:28] <JetpackMcQuack> Star wars also has lovecraftian space worms
[0:23:31] <%Zohare> It still being on the floor would be a good one
[0:23:34] <Redblood801> You probably didn't pick it up
[0:23:40] <lotharrio> Krath Holy Battle Suit?
[0:23:41] <%alpacasintophats> potentially left on floor?
[0:23:50] <Shade075> Remember when Darth Krayt gained holocrons of some of the greatest sith in history to ask for guidance and all they did was shit talk him and call Krayt a loser

[0:26:38] <brachydios777> I just remembered in canon that white kyber crystals are purified red crystals
[0:26:42] <Robot_Nixon_> Kreygasm ?
[0:26:42] <DSD24> Those guys look cool
[0:26:58] <subjectg> These guys are the coolest

[0:27:15] <%Malik1002> Maybe a little porn V
[0:27:18] <tranquilturnip> I don't remember this part of the game and I wonder if I blocked it out
[0:27:25] <gerakiv> its the black market from deadspace

[0:27:48] <SiegeJay> Twerka Industry?

[0:27:56] <%ChoculaUltra> It is the sith children who are out of touch!
[0:27:57] <$legacy0117> Probably As Sith I would train a Goddamn Krayt Dragon and arm it with a Gubdam Lightzaber.
[0:28:05] <dinnydanny777> Isn't that just capitalism?
[0:28:13] <$legacy0117> Lightsaber*

[0:28:45] <AvailableThor> The Plastic Side of the Force
[0:28:45] <Shade075> @legacy0117 He's a half tuskan raider fallen jedi who also knew of Aniken's sand people murder spree and hid it from the council
[0:29:06] <Redblood801> Technology in Star Wars is both magical and purely cosmetic
[0:29:10] <dinnydanny777> Mira seems like she would be a really lame Jedi
[0:29:11] <megamirk> their armor is kinda cool
[0:29:28] <DatAsuna> "not trained enough"
[0:29:34] <brachydios777> Darkside armor always looks cool
[0:29:37] <dinnydanny777> "Let me tell you the tale of Master Mira" "She wasn't particularly interesting"
[0:29:42] <DatAsuna> sh'ed go 1 caue she doesn't know
[0:29:42] <%threeheadedwalrus> You reckon they're going commando? Like Scottish kilts
[0:29:45] <%krispen_wa> visas and atton are the best for this section because CHARACTER ARCS
[0:30:03] <SiegeJay> Mira would be one of the Jedi's that would have gotten shot in the back when Order 66 went live
[0:30:09] <+griffball13> where's the lie
[0:30:10] <DSD24> The game is a bit quiet
[0:30:13] <megamirk> this guy is going all Kreia on us
[0:30:13] <+Zouledge> is it me or is the game voume low ? or is it just that one characters >
[0:30:14] <Joostebrood> echoooes
[0:30:14] <+cmdrmobium> I was 12 when I first played this, I never figured out how to train anybody
[0:30:15] <AvailableThor> ECHO ECHO ECHO
[0:30:16] <+Reverend_Roscoe> shot
[0:30:22] <dinnydanny777> Mira would have been a nameless Jedi getting shot too
[0:30:25] <Joostebrood> Avellone really likes that motif
[0:30:27] <DatAsuna> 3
[0:30:35] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> She has no plan.
[0:30:39] <%GeneralSCPatton> Instead, become a puppet of your own madness which is definitely not being inflicted by the elder god that we call the Force
[0:30:39] <Joostebrood> yeah this conversation falls a little flat
[0:30:41] <%krispen_wa> Mira would have died from droid mook fire before Oder 66
[0:30:41] <Redblood801> I can fill your dark soul with LIGHT!
[0:30:42] <%alpacasintophats> I
[0:30:44] <+HollowMan190> would she even say that

[0:30:50] <%Irridium> and not having your skin flake off
[0:30:50] <$legacy0117> Tuskan Raider Lightsaber wielder sounds fun, in the same way if you gave Conan the Barabian a Light-Axe.
[0:30:52] <%samspam999> In game voices are super quiet

[0:31:20] <%Pillagius> Oh...
[0:31:21] <brachydios777> The best reason
[0:31:34] <dinnydanny777> Force ghosties
[0:31:37] <JetpackMcQuack> They let anybody be a ghost these days
[0:31:39] <ChrisDalt> but there are sith force ghosts in the extended universe
[0:31:40] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Sith CAN become force ghosts
[0:31:43] <%krispen_wa> Can Force Ghosts watch people while they're doing the nasty?
[0:31:45] <+oda_flobunaga> EXAR KUN is a force Ghost RIGHT NOW
[0:31:48] <+GrassCannon> *laughs in Marka Ragnos*
[0:31:49] <%BallerSwagBro9k> REMEMBER KORRIBAN
[0:31:49] <dinnydanny777> Anakin was a force ghost
[0:31:51] <DatAsuna> you met sith ghosts in kotor 1 but thy suck
[0:31:52] <+doc_ock_rokc> FUCK that force ghosts can do shit
[0:31:53] <ralphfromdk> The Dark side never said they were smart, only strong :D
[0:31:54] <+griffball13> no spoilers
[0:31:55] <+ntfth> Sith aren't real ghosts, they're just stuck to a location/object.
[0:31:56] <dinnydanny777> Anakin became a force ghost
[0:31:57] <+CptnCampy61> And summon lightning....
[0:31:59] <SiegeJay> The Sequels dont count Force Ghosts are fucked in them
[0:32:00] <%jiggy_snipe> LUL
[0:32:00] <megamirk> remember how being a force ghost was unique to Liam Neeson
[0:32:01] <%spiritofmojave> Korriban IN KOTOR 1
[0:32:01] <%GeneralSCPatton> KOTOR 1 had a Sith ghost on Korriban
[0:32:04] <AvailableThor> Shut up chat we haven't been ot korriban yet.
[0:32:04] <brachydios777> I R O N I C
[0:32:08] <+eanscrale> Ironic... some would say
[0:32:10] <dinnydanny777> Anakin was a force ghost tho
[0:32:11] <%HostilePoundcakes> LUL
[0:32:14] <%DavidDredd84> "Ironic"
[0:32:14] <$legacy0117> That is funny.

[0:32:19] <+manasaurusrex03> no spoilers nerds
[0:32:22] <DatAsuna> kotor 1 isn't spoilers lol
[0:32:23] <Lefteron> ironic
[0:32:28] <%ChoculaUltra> Darth Mills uses Force Shush on the universe LUL
[0:32:29] <%spiritofmojave> Korriban from 1 is not a spoiler
[0:32:33] <+Stupid121v2> yall quit dat
[0:32:35] <+UberWolfman> BUT KOTOR 1 LUL chat pls
[0:32:36] <%GeneralSCPatton> It was in the first game!
[0:32:38] <SiegeJay> He said it boys! He said it!
[0:32:41] <+Leahcim_Mendes> i really need to play KOTOR
[0:32:50] <megamirk> I like rocket :)
[0:32:52] <Djinnazz> Boo!
[0:32:55] <$legacy0117> Oh force, it is so unbelievably fickle.
[0:32:59] <DSD24> "So you have chosen death"
[0:33:00] <ralphfromdk> GeneralSCPatton Yea, but they were closer to normal ghosts, linked to one shitty place stuck in their own loop of nothingness.
[0:33:01] <dinnydanny777> IT'S TREASON THEN
[0:33:01] <+GrassCannon> "So you have chosen death"
[0:33:07] <%Pillagius> Why can't you have their robes in the game? They look pretty dope!
[0:33:19] <%Zohare> Light side for who? How?
[0:33:19] <%gandalfsmagicgaydick> The force ghosts in Kotor I are chained to their resting place and not at peace. They're tortured. Force ghosts like Yoda and Obi-Wan are free to go wherever they want
[0:33:30] <notenoughgirls> george lucas decided force ghosts are exclusively light side which got carried into disney canon by clone wars
[0:33:33] <%GeneralSCPatton> @gandalfsmagicgaydick That's fair
[0:33:36] <%krispen_wa> Can Force Ghosts fuck?
[0:33:46] <ATPsoldat> With other force ghost probably
[0:33:49] <muniea3> two on two fight like it should be
[0:33:52] <damienlunas> Force Wave them
[0:33:52] <%Ghostbody> @krispen_wa maybe
[0:33:56] <dinnydanny777> If force ghosts are light side how did Anakin get one?
[0:34:11] <%GeneralSCPatton> @krispen_wa That's how you get a chosen one like Anakin, probably
[0:34:13] <AvailableThor> Anakin turned back to the light in the end.
[0:34:18] <brachydios777> It just dawned on me that the old sith force ghosts are usually stuck in one place
[0:34:23] <Lefteron> @krispen_wa was thinking the same thing
[0:34:28] <%CozyGUNNA> ^
[0:34:30] <Joostebrood> y TSL has weird difficulty spikes with companion quests
[0:34:35] <dinnydanny777> So if you do one light side act after spending ten years doing dark side acts you become light side?
[0:34:38] <DatAsuna> Yup that's the downside of them
[0:34:45] <DatAsuna> they're trapped in places or objects
[0:34:46] <gerakiv> sacrifice mira to the black marker
[0:34:47] <dinnydanny777> Like, Vader helped destroy planets hahaha
[0:34:48] <JetpackMcQuack> And he turned back into attractive hayden christenson
[0:34:50] <%Pillagius> indead
[0:34:56] <$legacy0117> Cause he turned Light side at the last second before dying, because he murdered Palpy.
[0:34:59] <+cmdrmobium> In the OT it was never said that you had to train to be a force ghost, it was just part of returning to the Force
[0:35:01] <SiegeJay> Sacrifice Mira for more time on the Clock
[0:35:05] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> She has the potential to be great. Doesn't mean she is now
[0:35:05] <AvailableThor> If it's an honest turn, then apparently yes.
[0:35:06] <brachydios777> @dinnydanny777 Episode 6 says thats the case
[0:35:12] <+cmdrmobium> ROTS established that Qui-Gon invented Force ghosts
[0:35:26] <$legacy0117> For some reason.

[0:37:20] <%Bluemanzee> Balkans smell ancient bitch
[0:37:20] <Shade075> I don't think the OT ment for force ghost to be a universal force power, otherwise there would be millions of them floating around
[0:37:21] <muniea3> "is that a penis cage?"

[0:38:45] <%gutlesscoward> what if he was super cool because he did so much DESPITE his lightsaber being crap
[0:38:46] <DSD24> @Hammatime8 I would assume its like how Dual Wielding is easier if you have a shorter blade in one hand and a normal one in the other
[0:38:53] <%OldManDeckardCain> Darth Pat Kappa
[0:38:53] <%Camail> Darth Error: pointer has no reference
[0:39:01] <+BlockingDisabled> That guy would cream himself if he saw the Doom Slayer in action...

[0:39:40] <megamirk> fucking Ikaruga
[0:39:41] <%andrex2311> game audio so low or is it just me?
[0:39:44] <dinnydanny777> That's a cool star ship
[0:39:48] <%Irridium> PogChamp sbfpYeyeye
[0:39:52] <brachydios777> @blockingdisabled I think he would have a pretty good shot at Mandalore
[0:39:56] <Space_Pagan> nice
[0:39:59] <Hammatime8> @DSD24 What I was getting at is that I thought lightsaber blades were weightless and devoid of wind resistance and a shorter blade wouldn't affect much
[0:40:05] <DatAsuna> Literally recycled asset from another game
[0:40:05] <%Pillagius> Oh didn't Canderus do the halo jump riding on top of one?
[0:40:08] <AvailableThor> It's very bird-like
[0:40:12] <Shade075> lytMOTIVATED
[0:40:12] <subjectg> hot take: this design is way better than the kotor 1 design
[0:40:14] <dinnydanny777> Kind of looks like an Arwing with it's wings pinned back
[0:40:15] <Hammatime8> That's a cool space ship
[0:40:17] <blackskulldragon18> woolieREGGIEFUL
[0:40:19] <%samspam999> Game audio low
[0:40:22] <brachydios777> That’s a cool ass ship
[0:40:22] <ralphfromdk> It's one of the nicer Star Wars ships.
[0:40:23] <%krispen_wa> ROBOT BEAST WARS
[0:40:30] <JetpackMcQuack> Looks like a Pelican
[0:40:37] <Joostebrood> i mean the Old Republic Era overall looked a lot less Star Wars-y untill Kotor rolled around iirc
[0:40:41] <+oda_flobunaga> Like life support
[0:40:45] <penitentpentwitch> Unimportant systems... Life Support?
[0:40:46] <Joostebrood> turns out Star Wars-y stuff sells better
[0:40:55] <Shade075> I think I had an old model kit of this ship that I never built
[0:40:55] <AvailableThor> "There's no air, you'll have to hold your breath!"
[0:40:59] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> life support
[0:40:59] <%WanderingSwordsman> You called it something from Exo Squad in the Kotor 1 LP
[0:40:59] <%andrex2311> why is the game so low????
[0:41:03] <%Irridium> "don't worry about it"
[0:41:04] <dinnydanny777> This Mandalorian must be extra evil, he has an English accent
[0:41:16] <megamirk> badass
[0:41:18] <%spiritofmojave> YEYEYE
[0:41:19] <ATPsoldat> Now the game volume is much better
[0:41:19] <%Pillagius> "Minor systems, like breaks, cupholder, life-support, and side blinkers"
[0:41:22] <megamirk> I fucking love Mandalorians
[0:41:26] <dinnydanny777> Wait is that Australian
[0:41:27] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YEYEYEYEYEYE
[0:41:28] <penitentpentwitch> Thank you for upping the game volume
[0:41:31] <Space_Pagan> They're adding basilisk war droid mount to swtor
[0:41:35] <Joostebrood> Mandalorians are kiwis
[0:41:36] <AvailableThor> Mandalorian: "pffff, life support"
[0:41:42] <brachydios777> Mandos are the best
[0:41:42] <tranquilturnip> Put Kreia in the mech LUL
[0:41:44] <dinnydanny777> My bad

[0:42:14] <+BlockingDisabled> Glory to Darth T3!
[0:42:19] <+cmdrmobium> Kreia always wanted to be an ODST
[0:42:20] <dinnydanny777> T3's character screen is the wrong colour
[0:42:21] <%Bluemanzee> Dark Lord T3
[0:42:22] <Hammatime8> Bring robit fren
[0:42:26] <Skullyton175> Darth party
[0:42:27] <megamirk> FOR MANDA.... well, okay
[0:42:31] <vulkan_vibes> fuck that metal box
[0:42:35] <subjectg> There’s a way to cheese security checks in this if need be
[0:42:57] <ralphfromdk> Darth T3 is the ultimate Sith. He's so good at hiding his Sithness that people think he's lightside :o
[0:43:10] <Joostebrood> notice how in the cutscene it sits down without issue but then there's a huge crack in the floor in-game
[0:43:12] <brachydios777> Nice landing
[0:43:17] <AvailableThor> That ship was like "lol what's an AA cannon?"
[0:43:19] <%Bluemanzee> T3 is a real one
[0:43:20] <Redblood801> I started zappin'
[0:43:20] <%alpharius88> T3 "FOR MANDALORE"
[0:43:20] <DatAsuna> FOR T3
[0:43:26] <tranquilturnip> That's star wars tradition
[0:43:27] <Hammatime8> T3 always copmes strapped
[0:43:30] <Shade075> T3 is a gun sith
[0:43:32] <JetpackMcQuack> That's a space battle ax
[0:43:33] <ShiningAxis> Bloodlust has seized T3
[0:43:44] <$Invlux> Godzilla music
[0:43:46] <tranquilturnip> T3's not taking any chances anymore
[0:43:58] <Space_Pagan> sweet music
[0:44:03] <Skullyton175> Granny has 20 stealth?!
[0:44:16] <Joostebrood> if you cheese the game Kreia literally gets more power point than she can spend - and you can't level her to max (50)
[0:44:30] <brachydios777> Reminds me of the separatists theme
[0:44:36] <Hammatime8> Have you ever seen a record label with a LAME name? It's heartbreaking.
[0:44:37] <%correctedsun117> Granny hates them droids
[0:44:38] <DatAsuna> fitting
[0:45:01] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus T3 is a portable wokrbench
[0:45:02] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[0:45:09] <penitentpentwitch> Now I wish they had Laser Axes in this game
[0:45:10] <%kekkerscrew> BETRAYAL ZAP
[0:45:11] <%GeneralSCPatton> 37? HOW?
[0:45:11] <DatAsuna> Just talk to T3 and you can do it right now
[0:45:17] <%Pillagius> I guess T stands for Tank
[0:45:17] <%gutlesscoward> Can't be touched, can't be stopped
[0:45:19] <Space_Pagan> Darth T3 has RISEN
[0:45:26] <%Irridium> T3 a fucking tank
[0:45:26] <DSD24> Or a Heat Axe from Gundam
[0:45:31] <ralphfromdk> T3's pistol seems real shitty
[0:45:32] <AvailableThor> Granny is so broken with force storm
[0:45:32] <Maleicus> give him a better gun
[0:45:46] <%Pillagius> Give her the short lightsaber Kappa
[0:45:51] <+prime_name> Give her Nad's lightsaber
[0:45:54] <subjectg> T3 has as much ac as a tarrasque, think about that
[0:45:59] <Halospaz117> Wait isn't Nadd's saber still in the tomb at this time?
[0:46:10] <%Irridium> T3 rips and tears
[0:46:10] <Halospaz117> Like, this is happening concurrently, right?
[0:46:11] <dinnydanny777> Give Kreia the short lightsaber, make the granny a Jedi Ninja
[0:46:13] <%Irridium> until it is done
[0:46:14] <AvailableThor> @Halospaz117 shhhhhhh
[0:46:19] <Chisas_Dead_Body> Oh yeah the purple is 3 times as accurate
[0:46:23] <blackskulldragon18> Zap
[0:46:41] <penitentpentwitch> Would be neat if purple gave bonuses if you were neutral
[0:46:48] <$Invlux> T3 is the Unstoppable Force and the Immovable Object
[0:46:51] <@Moobot> Easy with the emojis @Halospaz117

[0:47:27] <%HostilePoundcakes> PogChamp
[0:47:33] <PinkSocks> Perfect color too
[0:47:35] <DSD24> That looks nice especially with the purple
[0:47:39] <Lefteron> Senete eat your heart out
[0:47:43] <muniea3> is there a gray crystal for her?
[0:47:50] <ZealousGamer64> isn't state of play starting soon?
[0:47:55] <Joostebrood> iirc finesse melee weapons is bugged and gives you finesse on lightsabers as well (though maybe RCM fixes this)
[0:47:56] <+cmdrmobium> Also Purple is canon for her
[0:48:02] <AvailableThor> Her idle animation is still holding it with two hand even though shes missing a hand
[0:48:18] <DSD24> @AvailableThor She has the force hand skill
[0:48:22] <%Zohare> @DaBigVitus A little over 2/3 of the way through
[0:48:36] <Joostebrood> oh wow
[0:48:46] <%DaBigVitus> i see, thanks
[0:49:01] <Halospaz117> God, Daran Norris is everywhere in this game
[0:49:03] <$legacy0117> I prefer her with the axe. It's what she deserves to carry, as punishment for being a crabby old Grandma.
[0:49:04] <+griffball13> the beasts are bitches
[0:49:11] <DSD24> Wow that Jedi Master got a bunch of people killed

[0:52:56] <AvailableThor> @dinnydanny777 the mot broken of all pwoers
[0:52:57] <DatAsuna> Scream is a good opener because it lowers their saving throws vs force powers

[0:53:32] <%correctedsun117> BETRAYA
[0:53:32] <%emperordread> It was dark, the gun looked real enough
[0:53:32] <%Camail> could it be a grenade?
[0:53:33] <derap41> AoE?
[0:53:36] <dinnydanny777> Kreia is scared that T3 will usurp her rule
[0:53:37] <%andrex2311> BETRAYAL!!!
[0:53:39] <BYAKURENLOVER763> Betrayal.
[0:53:41] <%Malik1002> BETRAER
[0:53:41] <Halospaz117> YO GRANNY WTF
[0:53:41] <Maleicus> it was probably just a grenade
[0:53:42] <akman14> Maybe the enemy had Ion weapons?
[0:53:45] <+Stupid121v2> run the clip!!!
[0:53:47] <$legacy0117> That is intense.
[0:53:47] <dinnydanny777> T3 is becoming too strong and granny doesn't like it
[0:53:47] <blackskulldragon18> LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL
[0:53:48] <Thepothero> GRANNY WTF
[0:53:48] <AvailableThor> KREIA DOEN'T HAVE "PARTY MEMBERS"
[0:53:49] <%jiggy_snipe> she knows to fear Darth T3
[0:53:49] <%Zohare> She couldn't even destroy droid an enemy
[0:53:49] <derap41> Hey she gets confused ok
[0:53:51] <Redblood801> Clip it
[0:53:53] <+Stupid121v2> play it back!!!
[0:53:54] <Joostebrood> no you actually saw her use destroy droid there
[0:53:55] <Redblood801> Run it back
[0:53:55] <ralphfromdk> Granny shows he true, not so purple, colours.
[0:54:00] <Joostebrood> and there were no other droids
[0:54:13] <%gatorafan> Granny does what she wants
[0:54:20] <%spiritofmojave> Grandma being rude PunOko
[0:54:21] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Shinny1338
[0:54:23] <derap41> Listen she's up in ages sometimes droids look like droids ok
[0:54:29] <$legacy0117> So, that should be a clue.
[0:54:31] <DSD24> Its like that John Wick Part 2 scene with Common in that subway
[0:54:33] <+doc_ock_rokc> Granny is racist towards droids
[0:54:33] <+Estuko> @Shinny1338 NotLikeThis ow my ears

[0:59:04] <dinnydanny777> "The Jedi us slaughtering us what should we do" "fight him"

[0:59:32] <$legacy0117> Essentially.
[1:00:30] <Redblood801> 14 months
[1:00:37] <%alpacasintophats> does Keen = critical range extend?
[1:00:41] <$legacy0117> Why can't Jedi just scare these people off with their powers instead of killing them ALL?
[1:00:44] <Safarihat> crit threat range is keen iirc
[1:00:57] <dinnydanny777> Just force push them on the floor until they give up
[1:00:58] <subjectg> keen adds to your crit threat range
[1:01:14] <%krispen_wa> Why does nextor not just say Keen? Game dumb
[1:01:16] <%Zohare> Wisdom is saving, charisma is damage
[1:01:22] <lotharrio> Both go into damage I thought.
[1:01:27] <+doc_ock_rokc> WAIT does this mean Jedi are BARDS!
[1:01:29] <%Camail> force of personality
[1:01:37] <+GrassCannon> I mean, it is
[1:01:37] <dinnydanny777> I want to see a Jedi pick up a soldier who tries to attack him and just place him somewhere else and leave
[1:01:38] <blackskulldragon18> or warlock
[1:01:41] <$TheFabledAble> Force of personality
[1:01:41] <+GrassCannon> or bard
[1:01:41] <+oda_flobunaga> No dump stat
[1:01:42] <tranquilturnip> will is control charisma is power
[1:01:44] <bill_and_ted_dude> Good look them to death
[1:01:44] <+GrassCannon> or sorceror
[1:01:45] <Redblood801> Paladin
[1:01:46] <Them00n> Charisma is force of personality wis is force of will.
[1:01:47] <subjectg> both wisdom and charisma add to your force difficulty class
[1:01:57] <%andrex2311> if you are a warlock it is :p
[1:01:57] <%GeneralSCPatton> @dinnydanny777 Force Push into floor until they have no blood left
[1:02:01] <%spiritofmojave> The rare instance where you actually pump lots in CHR
[1:02:07] <%CommanderSqueaks> Woolie has clearly NEVER played a Sorcerer.
[1:02:10] <%CommanderSqueaks> I mean Warlock
[1:02:12] <%CommanderSqueaks> Warlock
[1:02:15] <Redblood801> Paladin, Bard, Sorc, Wralock
[1:02:17] <$legacy0117> Although this game does have multiple endings, and I seriously do not remember fighting through this part.
[1:02:19] <+doc_ock_rokc> The jedi confirmed bard subclass?
[1:02:24] <DSD24> Matching bonus!
[1:02:36] <%Camail> one is damage reduction the other seems to be saves
[1:02:41] <%Camail> i dunno
[1:02:42] <%alpacasintophats> 20 to the stat as opposed to 20%
[1:02:45] <subjectg> jedi are more like monks, if they were good
[1:02:53] <%CommanderSqueaks> Shit you're right, a LOT of classes use Charisma for magic damage. What D&D is Woolie playing?
[1:02:59] <RaijiZhn> Paladins make sense, Sith are just Oathbreakers LUL
[1:03:05] <%krispen_wa> OOOOOH

[1:04:18] <%krispen_wa> Wait that's actually pretty strong
[1:04:19] <Lefteron> he kiled himself with it

[1:04:37] <%insomniacCoder> he farted in the vicinity of the blaster

[1:04:42] <karthebest123> expected this chat to be alot faster cuz how popular woolie is
[1:04:44] <karthebest123> i like this

[1:04:50] <%Camail> thats 5-32, dang
[1:04:52] <Lefteron> it says POWER when you fire it
[1:04:53] <Halospaz117> No wonder he just had a short saber, this guy was just blasting motherfuckers
[1:04:58] <%andrex2311> It's like that doll's psycho gun!
[1:05:00] <DatAsuna> No maybe on this one

[1:05:26] <%GeneralSCPatton> @subjectg YEYEYE
[1:05:33] <huskarl_zap> Saber plus Blaster
[1:05:33] <%jiggy_snipe> he probably double wielded his saber and gun
[1:05:33] <%Bluemanzee> Freedon Nadd a gun sith I guess
[1:05:34] <DatAsuna> @dinnydanny777 not just the gun, but the bullets and clips too!
[1:05:36] <%Camail> Darth [Nothing]'s blaster

[1:05:44] <Chisas_Dead_Body> Earth (Nothing)
[1:05:56] <dinnydanny777> Obi Wan used a gun in that one fight
[1:05:56] <+doc_ock_rokc> Gun Saber GUNSABER
[1:06:04] <notenoughgirls> that gun is literally restricted to the player like what player is using guns at this point
[1:06:05] <Matermind0> I imagine Darth Nothing had a short lightsaber so he could CQB with it and this gun
[1:06:08] <AvailableThor> Wish this game has the dnd equivalent of Use Magic Item so you could just give it to HK
[1:06:09] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1265145307408539648
[1:06:11] <dinnydanny777> Is Obi Wan technically a gun Jedi
[1:06:21] <$legacy0117> There was one Blaster Slinger force user in one of these games, but I forget which one he was in.
[1:06:23] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> This gun is litteraly evil
[1:06:30] <+Feralspirit41> I recently beat this game as a gun jedi
[1:06:33] <huskarl_zap> Lightsaber bayonet
[1:06:35] <+Feralspirit41> it was pretty good
[1:06:42] <%krispen_wa> Gun jedi is busted as fuck in this game
[1:06:47] <%GeneralSCPatton> @matermind0 The gun has a notch carved in so he can hold them both like Naked Snake.
[1:06:54] <baronvonbirman> Nadd's weapons of choice was a gun and a lightsaber knife? Was he Rambo?
[1:07:00] <Joostebrood> Obsidian put way too much effort into making like 432 different armors that nobody is ever going to wear cause Jedi need to cast speed and lightning and Mandalore can't wear different armor
[1:07:01] <dinnydanny777> Can you use force powers to just shoot defenseless enemies?
[1:07:02] <+Feralspirit41> Especially with dual mando disintegrators
[1:07:15] <DSD24> Why do I feel like Fann is going "I see you! ZAP"
[1:07:21] <$legacy0117> He had a wide brim hat, forget. I'll have to look him up.

[1:07:58] <%GeneralSCPatton> @datasuna Wait, what reference did I miss?
[1:08:02] <%Chatterbox1991> keep in mind Headcrab Zombies can remain alive and conscious for years
[1:08:02] <$TheFabledAble> @WoolieVersus Charisma isnt considered purely a "can talk well" stat in D&D 5e. Its more of how strong your will is, and how capable your ability to enact that will through manipulation is, including your manipulation of magic. Magic can come to some people instinctively, so as a result it isnt governed by their faith or their intelligence but by their force of personality

[1:12:25] <$legacy0117> The character I was referring to is named Nico Okarr, for those interested in smuggler/Gungslinger force users in Old republic lore.
[1:13:26] <DatAsuna> Nico wasn't a force user

[1:18:14] <%Irridium> dude sneezed when naming that armor
[1:18:15] <$legacy0117> It does take a bit of time to probably cut through all of that Durasteel though to cut a tunnel around the doors.
[1:18:18] <a_mad_dragon> canadians were the ORIGINAL stormtroopers

[1:37:38] <megamirk> Fredon Nadd's Abacus
[1:37:44] <olaksi> I'd need pen and paper for this
[1:37:54] <Robot_Nixon_> distThink 3.... 5.... 2
[1:37:56] <dinnydanny777> Just start spamming buttons

[1:38:02] <dinnydanny777> Wait
[1:38:05] <Joostebrood> 66 x 2 = 132
[1:38:07] <Maleicus> wrong

[1:38:33] <%wicketpelican> he got the woolie face
[1:38:35] <%wicketpelican> that's impressive

[1:38:37] <%Zohare> It's all of the above
[1:38:39] <Deadbulky> TWICE
[1:38:42] <lotharrio> MATH
[1:38:42] <%jepupu> 2x = 0.5x + 99
[1:38:46] <dinnydanny777> Use force calculator
[1:38:49] <%Graxe_> The double of the number is 99 more than half of it
[1:39:07] <+AsinPersuasion> you just blew his mind
[1:39:13] <dinnydanny777> Use Force Havk
[1:39:15] <Deadbulky> LUL

[1:39:29] <subjectg> a l g e b r a
[1:39:34] <ShiningAxis> Jedi Mind Break just gives the victim asinine math problems to solve
[1:39:39] <%jepupu> 2x = 0.5x + 99 --> 1,5x = 99 --> x = 99 : 1.5
[1:39:39] <%GeneralSCPatton> @antyriku2 2x = 99 + .5x
[1:39:42] <+Ancopro> E= Ermm
[1:39:43] <+oda_flobunaga> yarp
[1:39:43] <%jepupu> = 66
[1:39:44] <penitentpentwitch> So math is the greatest weakness of the Jedi? It makes sense, they fail at multiplying so often.
[1:39:45] <DatAsuna> go for it

[1:49:15] <lotharrio> T3 can upgrade for you.

[1:49:46] <Mr__Jebus> no they drove the ottomans outta the balkans /s
[1:49:52] <%CommanderSqueaks> So if you have anxiety like me and your first reaction when you make eye-contact accidentally is to look away, you're fucked.
[1:49:53] <dinnydanny777> Midgar DOES in fact have space flight
[1:49:54] <+AsinPersuasion> do you get kreias stuff back after the conclave?
[1:50:00] <+Zouledge> @jetpackmcquack It will probably be a part of remake part 2 Kappa
[1:50:04] <dinnydanny777> It's just that space flight isn't profitable

[1:55:51] <dorpork> she attacked him
[1:55:58] <%Javaa01> She DEFINITELY stabbed T3 and Disabled T3
[1:55:58] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream

[2:04:51] <derap41> Was she used to paved roads?
[2:05:00] <penitentpentwitch> Isn't that why Speed Minimums exist?
[2:05:08] <akman14> psa1guy psa1guy psa1guy psa1guy psa1guy psa1guy psa1guy psa1guy psa1guy psa1guy
[2:05:13] <+Valask> that moment before the crash is the worst
[2:05:15] <+LegacyOfTheSith> theres a reason highways have minimum speeds
[2:05:15] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> km/hr
[2:05:15] <derap41> That is the whole point fucking old people
[2:05:18] <%caffienatedjedi> The real danger is deviations in speed, if everyone is doing 20 over and you are doing the limit you are the danger.
[2:05:27] <%jiggy_snipe> yea
[2:05:43] <tolloponik> theres a thing as a speed minimum?
[2:05:51] <+LegacyOfTheSith> 45 mph is the minumum here but most people are going at least 70 or 80
[2:06:00] <muniea3> teleporting on the road, got it
[2:06:01] <derap41> Best method is just matching the speed of your nearby cars
[2:06:09] <subjectg> of course, the first thing they drill into your head is to match the speed of traffic
[2:06:18] <derap41> TO defeat the huns?
[2:06:23] <+wunp_fxs> dats a long time
[2:06:23] <tolloponik> no

[2:06:38] <+ZoltanBMagnus> some humans weren't turned to stone
[2:06:38] <derap41> So its evil deade 3?
[2:06:42] <penitentpentwitch> The premise is the world is turned to stone, and years later the science kid and his friends are freed.
[2:06:48] <muniea3> everyone is turned to stone so there's no infrastructure
[2:06:50] <derap41> this is my BOOMSTICK!
[2:07:02] <Halospaz117> Hm, there's a way to explain this but I feel it'd be spoilers
[2:07:15] <%correctedsun117> How many hours is that?
[2:07:20] <muniea3> yeah explaining more is spoilers
[2:07:25] <vulkan_vibes> is iron blooded orphans any good?
[2:07:26] <Mr__Jebus> I can't believe i wasted my time watching ZZ
[2:07:29] <%RioGascar> That is a lot of gundam
[2:07:37] <%RioGascar> A lot
[2:07:39] <tolloponik> it's OK
[2:07:41] <%Malik1002> or leave them for the end
[2:07:45] <subjectg> ZZ becomes decent later but it’s quite the commitment
[2:07:53] <vulkan_vibes> he was a blaster Sith!
[2:07:59] <%Zohare> Iron blooded orphans wasn't great but I might be in the minority
[2:08:07] <DatAsuna> Nah you met ajunta pall
[2:08:15] <+AsinPersuasion> the battles in ibo are sick
[2:08:17] <ZeeJiggle> Talked to Paulie
[2:08:20] <DatAsuna> naga sadow was the great hyperspace war guy
[2:08:28] <+AsinPersuasion> but the plot got hamstrung by the director
[2:08:41] <+AsinPersuasion> who hated tekkadan for some reason
[2:08:43] <+LegacyOfTheSith> marka ragnos was the "first" sith lord right?
[2:08:50] <DatAsuna> not 14 months, just that he hates it
[2:08:50] <+wunp_fxs> good writer, bad art taste
[2:08:51] <notenoughgirls> it looks like a weird shrimp
[2:08:58] <DatAsuna> The n64 game
[2:09:18] <+Urgoslav> which sith lord was the blitzball guy? Darth lord ohalland?
[2:09:19] <DatAsuna> Well he didn't make anything lol

[2:10:31] <tolloponik> it could be cool
[2:10:32] <+ojesus1289> looks like a revengance boss
[2:10:38] <penitentpentwitch> As far as 'Gun Headed' characters go. I liked the 'noir' take on 'No Guns Life'.
[2:10:41] <+oda_flobunaga> A WEAPON TO SURPASS METAL GEAR?
[2:10:46] <DatAsuna> good name
[2:10:49] <%alpacasintophats> that is a dumb design but I still like it
[2:10:57] <%jiggy_snipe> it's face bothers me
[2:11:01] <Halospaz117> noice
[2:11:02] <derap41> Its not a bad game
[2:11:03] <%jiggy_snipe> its*
[2:11:08] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Bring back Little V! Bring back Little V!
[2:11:10] <Halospaz117> I'll take a maybe
[2:11:10] <thelivingglitch307> what face?
[2:11:20] <DatAsuna> it'd probbly take you like 3-4 sessions
[2:11:24] <Halospaz117> It ain't short but it ain't long either
[2:11:28] <%alpacasintophats> the face is actually what sells it for me
[2:11:29] <subjectg> it’s ok, not the second coming of christ, but it’s ok
[2:11:30] <DatAsuna> eh, 21 if you do exploring
[2:11:42] <dfs_k> it's a good game, but the story and characters are safe as fuck
[2:11:48] <%alpacasintophats> mainly because it reminds me of forge fiends from warhammer
[2:11:48] <%jiggy_snipe> I should say what would be a face but is instead cannons
[2:11:49] <DatAsuna> I beat it in 2 days fairly quickly when I wasn't doing collectibles
[2:11:52] <+LegacyOfTheSith> remember dark souls 2 being like 90 parts long OpieOP

[2:12:19] <$Fortunato5678> It's okay to break up the Star Wars games a bit

[2:12:27] <a_mad_dragon> 30 MINIMUM
[2:12:31] <DatAsuna> Yeah but this isn't just platforming for collectibles
[2:12:37] <subjectg> take a break by playing HL2
[2:12:40] <%jiggy_snipe> lol
[2:12:47] <derap41> Mass Effect would be nice
[2:12:48] <+Urgoslav> I like this game a little slower. I'm seeing coversations that b-line story runs would never show.
[2:12:54] <%jiggy_snipe> it's cool Woolie, I play rpgs the same way
[2:12:59] <derap41> See what Bioware learned from KotoR
[2:13:10] <DatAsuna> a lot of JFO hours would probably be off screen between sessions stuff
[2:13:28] <+rider_megalon> you think you have to go at Jade Empire it has literal like later choices
[2:13:50] <+oda_flobunaga> The Mass Effects are each 50 hours

[2:14:01] <+VERT3BREAK3R> icetroButt
[2:14:05] <derap41> @oda_flobunaga only if you do lots of side quests
[2:14:12] <DatAsuna> You probably wouldn't include 20 hours of footage of collecting skins/ponchos

[2:15:05] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus What they're trying to say I think is darth only became a sith thing after 2001, and old sith were 90s stories

[2:15:59] <+AsinPersuasion> you can do that math at 13 cmon
[2:16:04] <olaksi> The flip side of that is I learned english because RPGs
[2:16:13] <startstoprepeat> put in the aol keyword to speedrun kotor
[2:16:14] <+Urgoslav> ahh, my CheatCodeCentral text guide
[2:16:15] <Mr__Jebus> ah the good ol days of having someone make a phone call and losing your internet connection

[2:16:16] <%Irridium> I can't do that math at 28
[2:16:19] <+AsinPersuasion> whats up with leaf education lmao
[2:16:22] <subjectg> i remember writing out the solution on pad for that last question
[2:16:26] <DatAsuna> bioware loves towers of hannoi tho
