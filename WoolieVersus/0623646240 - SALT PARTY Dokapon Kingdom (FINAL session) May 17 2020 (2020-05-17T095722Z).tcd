[0:18:14] <%C4m3r0n0409> Guy is better than Lee
[0:18:16] <%0rond> mordred might get a big focus in FGO in LB6
[0:18:17] <ireliaismaiwaifu> >implying bleach is bad
[0:18:17] <Blank9> saving over half of the naruto characters from naruto
[0:18:19] <AlessandroNGT> Apocrypha is literally the worst Fate entry to date, the only good in it are Mordred and her Master
[0:18:19] <@Menitta> I wanted to make an Evangelion joke but they're all terrible
[0:18:21] <%xcompleasedad> No, Twitch was lying
[0:18:25] <InXplotch> can I save the cast of darling in the franxx from darling in the franxx
[0:18:25] <%Superdandy96> Shikamaru
[0:18:28] <%countgaculatv> I'd put Guy in Ippo
[0:18:29] <huskarl_zap> Wait why are we talking Astlfo?
[0:18:29] <%phatmac16> kenpachi is a good answer
[0:18:33] <Mr__Jebus> DO IT
[0:18:34] <%C4m3r0n0409> Bleach is no worse than Naruto
[0:18:39] <YouKnowThatGuy1> Yeah they both get shafted
[0:18:39] <%jiggy_snipe> Bleach isn't bad enough for this answer
[0:18:41] <%phatmac16> Astlfo is a popular trap character
[0:18:42] <%0rond> astolfo is a meme but they are also a top tier character straight up
[0:18:44] <XzileGaming> someone did, ask Nick Simmons
[0:18:44] <%Amaideus> Bleach is way better than naruto
[0:18:45] <YakumoYomi> @InXplotch No way, fam.
[0:18:46] <LaughingCatt> Can we do the reverse, pull some characters out of a series to make it better?
[0:18:47] <+Order_of_Mystery> Doaks was awesome
[0:18:48] <%GenesisKnight> Dokes got done dirty
[0:18:48] <FboyDaKing> @invlux I think dooms source code is available you can take a look and sorta reverse engineer it.
[0:18:48] <lotharrio> "Surprise motherfucker!"
[0:18:49] <aiutare47> @inxplotch If rather save the concept
[0:18:49] <mark_collins45> Some fries, motherfucker
[0:18:50] <%kapcommunist> yeeeeees
[0:18:50] <InXplotch> there are a lot of characters in apoc that are popular
[0:18:51] <Byr0nX> naruto is shit and will always be shit
[0:18:52] <%Amaideus> Even with the axe ending
[0:18:52] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @dorf1 But its goid again now. Watch Babylonia
[0:18:53] <JeoDood> @meatmaaan agreed
[0:18:55] <olm46> Most of the characters in bleach deserve a far better show.
[0:18:55] <%jiggy_snipe> especially since Bleach has alot of good characters
[0:18:56] <%BisoromiBear> Robo Doakes could have saved the series
[0:18:59] <+meatmaaan> save Jon snow from his whole plotline being pointless
[0:18:59] <Tuna_Can_0> SUPPLIES motherfucker
[0:19:00] <%C4m3r0n0409> Naruto is so much worse than bleach
[0:19:01] <+Order_of_Mystery> Dexter went downhill fast. D:
[0:19:03] <+ThomasOfTroy> Doakes was cool
[0:19:11] <InXplotch> honestly I'd accept just eliminating the last liek 3 episodes, lol
[0:19:11] <XzileGaming> NICK SIMMONS literally stole Kenpachi right outta Bleach
[0:19:12] <%Jrocy247> SOME FRIES MOTHA FUCKA
[0:19:14] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I don't know, I think Bleach, overall, is actually a little worse than Naruto
[0:19:17] <%0rond> memes notwithstanding Astolfo is a solid 10/10
[0:19:18] <%DaBigVitus> all the raiders dropping off. ouch.

[0:21:40] <+meatmaaan> Matthew Broderick also known as vehicular manslaughter man

[0:21:57] <%heartlesshealer> oh boy

[0:22:00] <YouKnowThatGuy1> Rip Kellogg fall out 4
[0:22:03] <%minusmarcigames> cornflakes, the chosen food of volcels
[0:22:03] <YakumoYomi> He thought plain food would stop people from fapping. Amusing.
[0:22:05] <$Invlux> Gotta jack off to the Quaker Oats guy for good measure
[0:22:09] <assfordayz> Sup, I ready to spoil miself
[0:22:10] <Scrummo> were the corn flakes supposed to get stuck in there?
[0:22:14] <Zeif00> Some of the character designs maybe
[0:22:27] <+meatmaaan> @superdandy96 either or
[0:22:31] <+aslfrasle> I'd say no charm potions in shops, only drops.
[0:22:36] <%paladinstarbuster> I wish NPCs did more
[0:22:36] <+TheRisingPride> 8 player Dokapon mod when
[0:22:39] <%Amaideus> I'd make the shops run out of items
[0:22:41] <Mr_Ease> All the hair options available at once
[0:22:41] <%jiggy_snipe> maybe a combo
[0:22:45] <%Amaideus> And have to restock
[0:22:45] <FboyDaKing> Also it must let u pet the dog.
[0:22:45] <%Superdandy96> Character designs could be better in some areas.
[0:22:51] <%GenesisKnight> Well only one of you abuses the hell out of it
[0:22:53] <+Bricespresso> clarity on status would be better
[0:22:53] <Fanciful_Unicorn> Field Magic actually has a little magic base too
[0:22:54] <FboyDaKing> I wanna pet cash
[0:22:55] <%Amaideus> Or make magic mirrors more easily bought
[0:22:57] <%JojoPiero> black skin mcs perhaps
[0:22:58] <megamanicpuppet> are they starting or ending
[0:22:59] <%coldfire0007> MP needs buff, SP needs nerf
[0:23:00] <Valentinius_Anodyne> 8 Player Dokapon would be rad
[0:23:01] <bashful_bard> Magic accuracy should totally be magic primarily
[0:23:05] <FboyDaKing> Or mitch digger
[0:23:06] <YouKnowThatGuy1> Starting
[0:23:06] <Monkeyweed21> Speed for dodgem, MG for hit chance and power
[0:23:08] <Fanciful_Unicorn> speed to make it hit, but your Magic makes it more damaging
[0:23:12] <%emperordread> Online money matches for Dokapon Kingdom 2
[0:23:23] <+TheRisingPride> If DEF affected odds of getting hit by field magic, it might actually be a useful stat
[0:23:24] <%jiggy_snipe> everything needs an obvious easy counter if the thing is easy to use
[0:23:31] <FboyDaKing> @emperordread matcherino integration.
[0:23:43] <jhonxiolonn> Woolie, you should try the Cinders mod
[0:23:45] <+NWR_James> AI Rivals who exist only to hunt you down and ruin your run
[0:23:50] <assfordayz> LUL
[0:23:51] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Yeah, that would be ideal
[0:23:53] <+thecmash> hey guys tuned in late, whats the blood pool at?
[0:23:57] <YouKnowThatGuy1> Hero class should be easily to get
[0:24:01] <Mr_Ease> All hair unlocked from the start, and maybe spaces to change class other than the castle
[0:24:15] <MagicJeffy> online dokapon should have voice chat that can't be turned off
[0:24:19] <YouKnowThatGuy1> Change jobs at temple
[0:24:29] <+FlubbedPig> Maybe have like, MG for your chance to hit with Field Magic vs their Speed for chance to dodge? That way it's a lot tougher to get a character that can hit every time without ever being hit.

[0:26:20] <%Amaideus> I mean, Poker
[0:26:22] <%Ipsenscastle> DSP will be the only think left after the nukes
[0:26:29] <+RealPT1> mystery tournament with dokapon
[0:26:29] <%Ipsenscastle> *thing
[0:26:31] <gekizenbu> Dokapon in the bathroom
[0:26:31] <aiutare47> If someone doesn’t die is it really dokapon?
[0:26:32] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:26:33] <%emperordread> I would take out a 2nd mortgage to fund a dokapon money match entry
[0:26:34] <Valentinius_Anodyne> That would make it even better, being dunked on by RNG
[0:26:42] <+Estuko> @Ipsenscastle I hate that it's possible with how he even escaped the 500k debt recently..
[0:26:42] <%netrac> 100K Dokapon invitational
[0:26:42] <%gatorafan> Dokapon is not E-Spoprts
[0:26:52] <Explodincatz> woolie there are leaderboards of randomizers
[0:26:55] <assfordayz> Who wants to see a "Total global saturation" meme?
[0:27:01] <TheFinalSentinel> @gatorafan not with that attitude
[0:27:01] <%minusmarcigames> dokapon requires thuggery
[0:27:02] <%optimasmaximas> @Estuko he WHAT?!
[0:27:04] <bashful_bard> God a dokapon invitational would be disastrous
[0:27:05] <cobalt_phoenix_> if there was competitive Dokapon, the only way anyone would win would be by being the last to have a heated gamer moment
[0:27:08] <%GenesisKnight> Call up RT and set up Hardcore Dokapon
[0:27:10] <$Invlux> Twitch Plays: Dokapon
[0:27:14] <redstrawherring> Character Polls
[0:27:17] <BurdRightsActivist> DOKAPON is better reality tv than reality TV
[0:27:18] <%C4m3r0n0409> MITCH. DIGGER
[0:27:23] <+Estuko> @optimasmaximas super massive debt, I think he declared bankruptcy or somethin. No more debt.
[0:27:24] <FboyDaKing> @invlux YES
[0:27:26] <huskarl_zap> this is also rigged
[0:27:27] <FboyDaKing> YES
[0:27:33] <%vextalyst> cheer500 yo woolie I feel super embarrassed having recommended Airgear as literally JSRF the anime without even knowing Skankfunk worked on the anime's soundtrack. Also for a question earlier lets not forget Rick Grimes got literally airlifted out of TWD
[0:27:34] <JeoDood> dokapon > tv show
[0:27:36] <DedlokPM> So we have Dokapon the Manga, Dokapon the Anime, but when we getting Dokapon the Netflix Adaptation?
[0:27:42] <evilaltruistic> people dont care how fair the game is. they care of how entertaining it is
[0:27:48] <$Invlux> Just set up a separate channel for each controller lol
[0:27:48] <%optimasmaximas> @Estuko oh i know about that i just wanted to know how he escaped it
[0:27:53] <%ChoculaUltra> I imagine “hardcore dokapon” is dokapon but everyone has a flensing knife.
[0:27:54] <YouKnowThatGuy1> No bots as that's an issue for sneaky difficulty bots
[0:28:06] <%minusmarcigames> fuck i don't care, rig it to shit
[0:28:08] <%minusmarcigames> wrestling is good
[0:28:13] <Jontman42> the game was rigged from the start and they'll split the bloodpool even
[0:28:19] <+dankdirtydan> are they still friend?
[0:28:25] <%DaBigVitus> As the drill rotates and my well gets bigger, how many bitches wanna fuck this digger named mitch.
[0:28:26] <huskarl_zap> NO
[0:28:26] <+TheRisingPride> The Netflix Adaptation will be the highlight reel that's gonna come out in like 3 months
[0:28:27] <%Amaideus> God bless Air Gear's anime
[0:28:33] <+Promessa_EX> i want to see blood go to winner and it get used

[0:28:46] <%phatmac16> Air Gear gets real dumb, Obama shows up lol
[0:28:47] <+Estuko> Salty bet, set all players to NPC's and let them ravage each other.
[0:28:47] <+Promessa_EX> that helicopter crashed
[0:28:48] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Xxnanshankingladdyxx
[0:28:48] <+NWR_James> Hire NPCs to conspire against a player. They can hire the NPC to their side but the price goes up each time

[0:37:56] <%GreatMonorail> Reggie developed by not only having a plan but writing it down.
[0:37:58] <%Daba_mk2> The plan
[0:38:03] <%DashXero> Is Reggie about to pull some Joseph Joestar shit?!

[0:38:29] <%yeetdabsenpai69> go over and take his passports
[0:38:36] <%countgaculatv> Minh turned on his secret switch to stop controllers from working LUL
[0:38:37] <Kei_Ar_> Its cross tekken all over agian
[0:38:39] <%GreatMonorail> It would have been great if reggie pulled out a binder with a single sheet of loose leaf in it
[0:38:41] <%soFISHticated98> why does reggie want minh's passport anyways

[0:39:20] <%Morning_Asakura> this was part of the plan
[0:39:21] <%hoenhime344> @soFISHticated98 thats the point. you need to give up 1/4 of your towns to get the passport.
[0:39:21] <%soFISHticated98> instead woolie is getting a head start

[0:39:32] <+JamesCorck> I'm watching the anime of Dokapon, but I can't catch u`p in time, so for the first time I'm going to read ahead on the manga.

[0:42:55] <+Dimfish> he cant go to hell minh stole his passport
[0:43:04] <%soFISHticated98> he can get a new one
[0:43:10] <%C4m3r0n0409> Rand is more tho
[0:43:13] <Dalkalopagus> If they could do a pincer move with one in Africa and one in Australia, it could work. Not worth the effort though
[0:43:16] <%Superdandy96> @dimfish can’t he just get a new one though?
[0:43:16] <+Dimfish> why do that when he can steal it ack
[0:43:20] <%DashXero> Has Reggie been reviewing the tapes?
[0:43:21] <%EyeFarted> Makita Hahaha
[0:43:23] <%soFISHticated98> because it's a waste of time

[0:43:28] <%JojoPiero> Wait Woolie reset the world and then just... went to Hell and didn't get any cities?
[0:43:30] <%soFISHticated98> he's taking like 10 turns to chase minh down
[0:43:34] <JeoDood> reggie is waiting for minh
[0:43:39] <%soFISHticated98> when he can just go to heck right now

[0:43:58] <Zebekis> The notebook is blank! It's a bluff!
[0:43:58] <redstrawherring> @jojopiero woolie has like 3 castles
[0:44:00] <+Dimfish> but he could get a bunch of towns then get into hell free
[0:44:01] <%C4m3r0n0409> @JojoPiero Pretty much
[0:44:02] <ExileNineteen> @JojoPiero he has plenty of castle value, and he's guessing the final boss is worth
[0:44:05] <agilesalmon> Galaxy brain time
[0:44:06] <%soFISHticated98> meanwhile woolie can afford to waste time getting a red chest
[0:44:07] <alexandrecau> He couldn't attack minh on that turn
[0:44:08] <+teavian> Your dreams are unclear

[0:46:13] <Mr_McFries> Right now, because of Minh's cowardice, he is wasting a ton of turns. If Reggie followed him in, he would be wasting turns as well

[0:46:24] <Mr__Jebus> Minh part of the 1%
[0:46:31] <%soFISHticated98> Minh's biggest mistake was taking a passport
[0:46:34] <%soFISHticated98> he didn't need one
[0:46:43] <%yeetdabsenpai69> go to heck reggie
[0:46:44] <%soFISHticated98> he should have just took all the towns while Reggie and Woolie were in Heck
[0:46:45] <arkv01> minh they will eat you and refrigerate the leftovers
[0:46:45] <%Superdandy96> Well, he is the Minhister of Evil Kappa
[0:46:48] <sonofthedeepsouth> Will the murder scene be today?
[0:46:48] <Mr_McFries> With Minh being alchemist, I'm not sure outright killing him would be that big of a setback

[0:48:58] <armchairmaster_> Must win
[0:49:00] <Make_me_mad> I feel like Woolie just looked up how to win the game easy and is doing that.

[1:21:23] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @sofishticated98 and even if he did minh stands no chance
[1:21:24] <%soFISHticated98> minh can take the boss by attrition with revivals
[1:21:27] <%jiggy_snipe> i don't think Minh can end. If Wallace is level 88 wtf is Rico Sr. gonna be

[1:33:59] <bashful_bard> He'd waste more time dying this far in
[1:34:02] <ExileNineteen> reggie can't use a spinner if he uses magic
[1:34:04] <%Amaideus> It's basically even @randominternetsurfer
[1:34:05] <+keviniscool> dokapon is winning
[1:34:07] <%jiggy_snipe> Reggie there is no reason not to use your field magic
[1:34:08] <%fuji_92> WE STUCK ON THE BOAT CHAT
[1:34:08] <Idon__> REASON BEING...?
[1:34:09] <+SaltyGhostRock> @randominternetsurfer not reggie

[1:34:45] <%emperordread> @Th3SmartAlec no but he knows which it is
[1:34:46] <%C4m3r0n0409> Minh hasn't even seen his clonus
[1:34:52] <%elbigante> did i miss anything in the last hour
[1:34:58] <%C4m3r0n0409> Nope
[1:35:03] <mushplush77> @elbigante Woolie got a gun
[1:35:07] <%jiggy_snipe> why save it?
[1:35:08] <%C4m3r0n0409> True
[1:35:13] <%Th3SmartAlec> @emperordread So Woolie still got a few turns
[1:35:17] <%emperordread> @elbigante Reggie found Wallace under the sea and got wasted. Woolie found a gun
[1:35:22] <%Amaideus> That's suspect
[1:35:22] <rufus2k2> Woolie has Gene Starwind's Caster Gun
[1:35:24] <alexandrecau> Lock him and go get purse cut
[1:35:29] <%gutlesscoward> can minh dupe passports
[1:35:35] <MisterArcanine> Reggie use items tricksters!

[1:35:40] <Heartless_01> weird.
[1:35:41] <cobalt_phoenix_> BUT WHAT IF HE NEEDS IT LATER
[1:35:43] <%Superblooms> Woolie ain't gonna beat Rico on this run though.
[1:35:46] <MisterArcanine> Fuck Minh over while he’s in heck
[1:35:51] <Make_me_mad> The problem with Minh's clonus is that it can rust his equipment.
[1:35:55] <%pietrowaffleton> wooliePOYO

[1:36:04] <%jiggy_snipe> is he trying to fight Wallace?
[1:36:04] <+TheRisingPride> The plan to take over Africa I assume
[1:36:05] <%C4m3r0n0409> Is he gonna fight Wallace again?
[1:36:05] <RurouniGeo> Yes it does matter lol
[1:36:06] <+Gespens> Reggie, just take towns
[1:36:06] <+agumon9000> Reggie fucked up big time

[1:36:21] <%Jrocy247> @Superblooms He could if he actually think properly
[1:36:24] <Monkeyweed21> USE DARKLING TO DEFEAT RICO
[1:36:26] <+TheRisingPride> He's either going for Africa takeover, or Wallace and winning off local item value
[1:36:34] <Zuzu_Pachulia> that coliseum never came into play this game, did it?
[1:36:34] <%soFISHticated98> darkling can't fight monsters
[1:36:36] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @monkeyweed21 cant

[1:36:58] <BurdRightsActivist> U MAD 2007 MEMES
[1:37:01] <%jiggy_snipe> I feel like Reggie should grind a bit before he fights Wallace again

[1:37:36] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @armchairmaster_ what is this preparing you talk of reggie doesnt understand
[1:37:37] <RurouniGeo> Reggie is just going to die to Wallace again because he won't have the guts to strike him
[1:37:39] <%Jrocy247> Is Reggie REALLY more concerned about Wallace than he is end game???

[1:47:19] <morningmoondude> 243 SP
[1:47:20] <%soFISHticated98> yeah he'll do less damage
[1:47:21] <gryffinp> Is that even better without the +30% from the class bonus?
[1:47:22] <+blademaster247> Speed go up but staff give 30%
[1:47:23] <Mr_Ease> Staff is actually better
[1:47:23] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Minh, Left Hand of God
[1:47:23] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Gespens

[1:47:26] <%Jetzord> Karma is balancing the checkbooks now
[1:47:28] <Fanciful_Unicorn> Minh is using hacks up in here
[1:47:29] <Idon__> even more SPEED
[1:47:29] <bevyrage> doesn't minh have the zebra band?
[1:47:31] <+Zenryoku21> the 30% tho?
[1:47:32] <%emperordread> God-o Pawnch!
[1:47:32] <%Superblooms> but the speed.
[1:47:32] <SGrim> Minh is destined to win woopsGasm
[1:47:32] <+teavian> ROAR OF EARTH
[1:47:32] <lotharrio> You got rid of that one.
[1:47:33] <%NickHatesSnow> THE GODDESS OF SPEED IS REAL
[1:47:33] <%soFISHticated98> it's only +10 attack
[1:47:34] <%BurningSaph> Reggie got rings of magic
[1:47:35] <+Dimfish> reggie got a bunch of items last session
[1:47:35] <%StaceMcGate> Atack will go down, but 20 speed tho
[1:47:36] <Mr__Jebus> yes cuz he loses his 30%
[1:47:36] <%jiggy_snipe> the ring of magic Reggie like twice
[1:47:37] <agilesalmon> Take everything I own for health, sounds like American healthcare system.
[1:47:37] <%Ipsenscastle> Reggie got offered only duplicates last time
[1:47:38] <+el_boney> Take the Fist!
[1:47:38] <%SuperKirby24> NERF YOUR MAGIC LUL

[1:47:41] <%gatorafan> THE FINGER OF GOD daedra1DrunkTibs
[1:47:42] <%jillpilled> Minh is of the Dokapon Gods' chosen
[1:47:43] <Mr__Jebus> no dont think
[1:47:44] <%DiscoDur0> Alchemist is magician base
[1:47:44] <%soFISHticated98> YES MINH
[1:47:44] <%ekodrop> good man
[1:47:46] <+bizzer10> take that shit
[1:47:46] <huskarl_zap> VILLAIN COLLUDING WITH THE DEMONS
[1:47:46] <%soFISHticated98> thank you
[1:47:47] <Leonavius> Is Alchemist considered magician-class?
[1:47:51] <%Superblooms> understandable.
[1:47:53] <+bizzer10> take it dummy
[1:47:53] <Xeno351> 20 SPEED
[1:47:54] <%Amaideus> Ye
[1:47:56] <%Solidnick18> Come on woolie
[1:47:56] <%soFISHticated98> yes
[1:47:56] <+el_boney> Big speed tho
[1:47:57] <%heartlesshealer> man, fuck off with the give up machine
[1:47:58] <Idon__> SPEED THO
[1:47:59] <%fuji_92> BUT SPEED
[1:48:01] <%C4m3r0n0409> LUL
[1:48:01] <%yeetdabsenpai69> dont take it :)
[1:48:03] <Idon__> aww
[1:48:03] <%Jrocy247> @Leonavius Basically
[1:48:03] <%ekodrop> 3
[1:48:04] <morningmoondude> SPED
[1:48:05] <%KosOrSomeSayKosm_> he turned down the god hand
[1:48:05] <%irfan_> thats a 5 percent drop apparently
[1:48:06] <%heartlesshealer> I mean, it's funny, but damn
[1:48:06] <roarofdamnation> difficult but i get it
[1:48:06] <%hoenhime344> yessssssssssssssssssssss
[1:48:08] <%yeetdabsenpai69> YES
[1:48:08] <%royb2> he already has enough speed to 0% field magic
[1:48:14] <%Ipsenscastle> temple reggie
[1:48:17] <%Superblooms> but more speed
[1:48:17] <%therabbles> speed is negligible for minh at this point
[1:48:17] <%yeetdabsenpai69> WOOLIE HAS A
[1:48:20] <%soFISHticated98> 20% is the minimum I think
[1:48:21] <%EyeFarted> TWICE
[1:48:23] <%GenesisKnight> You got the ring of magic twice
[1:48:23] <%Amaideus> Didn't it try to give him the ring of magic twice when he already had one?
[1:48:23] <%soFISHticated98> but point is real
[1:48:25] <ExileNineteen> you can never 0% field magic with only speed, always 20%
[1:48:25] <%yeetdabsenpai69> ADVANTAGE
[1:48:25] <+Zenryoku21> I wonder if it would've had a special chance like woolie's tho
[1:48:30] <MileenaTheOni> What is a god, to a heretic?
[1:48:31] <%BurningSaph> Someday pockets will have a shield
[1:48:31] <+SaltyGhostRock> That is the nail in reggie's coffin
[1:48:34] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @amaideus yes
[1:48:36] <bashful_bard> Give up yields items every time so not quite 5%
[1:48:38] <%soFISHticated98> well he was fighting the lich a bunch of times
[1:48:39] <arkv01> put a ring on it
[1:48:39] <+Gespens> WOOLIE FIRST
[1:48:43] <%pectusumbra> To be fair that gun is sick, and if you were a robo knight it'd be even better
[1:48:44] <zocano> Reggie could win if he takes enough times before the kill
[1:48:44] <Fanciful_Unicorn> COMMIT!
[1:48:45] <%soFISHticated98> and that's the drop it gives most commonly
[1:48:50] <Electro96> what led reggie to this plan?
[1:48:50] <%xcompleasedad> Pockets is First?
[1:48:54] <%Th3SmartAlec> Lets gooooo

[2:06:30] <daddytrashprime> Hello Woolzmeister and squad of slightly lower interest. I wanted to point out to you that according to early Boruto, the reason for why Orochimari got off the hook is because his research is vital to prepare for more moon aliens, and he is kept under constant ANBU surveilance. @WoolieVersus
[2:06:30] <ExileNineteen> this is a good move if he does it
[2:06:32] <%Grayhammatter> there's big guards

[2:14:02] <%SomersaultJustice> I can't wait for him to think this much and then it resolves in one round
[2:14:03] <thesickestzak> Oh yeah this is super understandable
[2:14:03] <%SuperKirby24> Take all the time in the world pls
[2:14:05] <%Ipsenscastle> All Woolie's thinking boils down to 'This might happen .... BUT THAT might happen also'
[2:14:06] <+Bl4kDynamite> Leave him be this turn
[2:14:08] <gryffinp> STRIKE
[2:14:08] <%alpacasintophats> take your time and probably wait a turn

[2:15:21] <%royb2> @DiscoDur0 But he isnt strong enough to beat Daddy Ric
[2:15:21] <%SuperKirby24> woolieDATTEBAYO_TK woolieDATTEBAYO_TK
[2:15:21] <%nintega010> that revival messes up everything
[2:15:22] <alexandrecau> but neither will Woolie
[2:15:23] <%Grayhammatter> guardian will take him
[2:15:24] <%heartlesshealer> but the infinite revival will be destroyed forever!
[2:15:25] <%soFISHticated98> mtg is not that complex lmao
[2:15:25] <%dogwelder02> you have to win two times with him AT HALF HEALTH
[2:15:25] <%Solidnick18> or it's rico
[2:15:26] <kkjingles> This is the hxh stairs all over again
[2:15:26] <%pectusumbra> Mmmm. Time for neutral jihn I think
[2:15:26] <%DaBigVitus> this is the worse it's ever been
[2:15:28] <%Solidnick18> idk
[2:15:29] <%Ipsenscastle> you already know you're waiting, why delay more
[2:15:29] <%soFISHticated98> not enough for 40 minute turns
[2:15:31] <huskarl_zap> Skeet then yeet on min
[2:15:32] <+BizarreRevolver> it would take 2 turns to win anyway
[2:15:36] <%C4m3r0n0409> So play safe
[2:15:37] <%Jrocy247> The only way Minh could get Woolie, is if Curse activated. WHICH IS A LOW CHANCE. Woolie would take Minh's Item
[2:15:37] <suddenlyscorched> This is when the Good Shonen Music Plays while the hero takes a split-second to analyze the battlefield
[2:15:37] <supergoblinpunch> Minh knows Woolie overthinks everything
[2:15:38] <Idon__> are you playing to win or are you playing to avoid losing?
[2:15:39] <%fuji_92> JUST WAIT
[2:15:40] <Valdorick> MAKE YOUR OWN FATE
[2:15:41] <+Mekhet09> Woolie. play safe.
[2:15:44] <BlkFlameKami> woolie about to trust the computer to fuck minh
[2:15:44] <%C4m3r0n0409> Play safe
[2:15:44] <+TheRisingPride> How many turns are we away from Weber's Contract?
[2:15:46] <FeralRageGaming> ALL IN. GO!
[2:15:46] <%jiggy_snipe> play safe
[2:15:49] <+cvp5127> wait

[2:15:49] <%DiscoDur0> @royb2 yeah, woolie needs a sheild
[2:15:50] <%jiggy_snipe> TIME TO TURTLE
[2:15:50] <$Invlux> You could always jump in when it's looking more in your favor
[2:15:50] <%Solidnick18> this is big money plays guys
[2:15:52] <seanmartin025> watch as woolie makes the wrong decision after all this thinking
[2:15:53] <funwashere> Dont forget revival chairOhmygod
[2:15:54] <%SomersaultJustice> RUN IN AND STRIKE
[2:15:55] <eldercat> Kill the demon.
[2:15:56] <%Amaideus> Fighting the computer would be braindead
[2:15:56] <%vaderxyz1970> Woolies brain is his own worst enemy
[2:15:56] <+mechslayer71> Is this the end, chat?
[2:15:57] <%Ipsenscastle> Yes let's play out every single permutation of events
[2:15:57] <JetpackMcQuack> Woolies right
[2:15:58] <strayed42> Heaven or Hell, LET'S ROCK
[2:15:59] <huskarl_zap> Why doesn't Woolie the largest just consume the other smaller males?
[2:15:59] <%ChoculaUltra> this is Chimera Ant arc levels of breakdown rn LUL
[2:15:59] <%fuji_92> PLAY SAFE WOOLS
[2:16:00] <%soFISHticated98> weber contract would benefit only minh and reggie lol
[2:16:00] <%shry7> wait a turn
[2:16:02] <%Amaideus> You'd literally have done his job for him
[2:16:03] <%heartlesshealer> woolie no
[2:16:03] <BoomerUnchained> Fortune favors the bold Woolie
[2:16:05] <%Jrocy247> Fuck that Play safe shit, that's stupid. He could TOTALLY get Minh
[2:16:05] <%soFISHticated98> i mean minh and woolie
[2:16:06] <%dogwelder02> woolie please
[2:16:07] <%hoenhime344> FIGHT

[2:16:39] <%hoenhime344> FILTHY PUSSY
[2:16:39] <%Amaideus> "clip"

[2:21:21] <Darkbat52> Reggie
[2:21:21] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Reggie, unfortunately
[2:21:22] <%Jrocy247> @SchwaAkari I wouldn't believe that. You know why? He overthinks, which causes him to make the wrong choices. Which has happened MANY of times
[2:21:22] <%Amaideus> But Minh's been the best player this entire LP so I think he should win
[2:21:22] <CallMeMrFahrenheit> Team not so minh
[2:21:23] <%Jetzord> Reggie
[2:21:24] <%heartlesshealer> I'm on Team not-Minh

[2:21:33] <samuraijakanddaxter> I missed the blood pool announcement at tye start, what are we at?
[2:21:34] <%Grayhammatter> reggie, i hope he can kill wallace
[2:21:34] <armchairmaster_> Woolie
[2:21:35] <+Gondab> Reggie can still come back!
[2:21:36] <%StaceMcGate> @Fujiwara_92 it won't end, but lets see what everyones loyalty is
[2:21:36] <%BisoromiBear> God has chosen Minh and so should you
[2:21:36] <%Amaideus> But if Woolie or Reggie wins because of reasons I'm 100% okay with that
[2:21:36] <%JojoPiero> I'm still holding out for Pockets, gotta get that lesbian ending
[2:21:38] <%iswearimjustdandy> Ive been woolie since the beginning, havent changed a single time
[2:21:38] <ExileNineteen> minh best player, minh worst winner
[2:21:38] <%gatorafan> Minh
[2:21:39] <KnivesEve> who ever is chaos team i with
[2:21:39] <%jillpilled> LIFE WILL CHANGEEE
[2:21:41] <+TheRisingPride> I'm on Team Not-woolie, but also hoping Minh gets his come-uppance since the Alchemist abuse arc
[2:21:41] <%Amaideus> @samuraijakanddaxter 4075
[2:21:43] <+AWanderingKenku> They're scheming how to split the blood pool money when this is over!
[2:21:43] <%Solidnick18> reggie pls
[2:21:44] <%dogwelder02> even if he died, minh prolly couldnt have beaten rico at half health

[2:21:49] <zocano> Reggie is in the running if he gets the window to take towns
[2:21:51] <%C4m3r0n0409> Whoever wins wins at this point
[2:21:52] <%BearSawed> team GUN
[2:21:54] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Is this whole stream "the planet will blow up in 5 mins"?
[2:21:59] <zocano> The week event screwed him
[2:21:59] <Augus7717> ANYONE BUT MINH
[2:22:01] <armchairmaster_> Even if Reggie kills Wallace, it won't be enough to get the lead
[2:22:01] <%NeroInfinite> Life Will Change
[2:22:03] <%jillpilled> Here's how Reggie can still win!
[2:22:05] <bashful_bard> GUN will prevail
[2:22:06] <%SchwaAkari> I've never been on any of the teams; I think for a blind run on one of the most brutal games ever created these three are equally my heroes
[2:22:06] <Fanciful_Unicorn> I would support Minh if the game wasn't slanting so far in his favor
[2:22:07] <%Struggleful> God is on Minh's side. Team Woolie is for the Heretics
[2:22:08] <mdkcde> team "THE ENEMIHN MUST NOT WIN"
[2:22:10] <daddytrashprime> Anyone saying they're not here for Woolie more so than the other two is a liar.
[2:22:12] <%Jrocy247> Nah, Reggie is done, he's wasting his time on Filler, It's only Minh and Woolie that may result the final win
[2:22:13] <%heartlesshealer> as soon as the boys found out about Alchemist, all my hype has turned to hate
[2:22:14] <%emperordread> Reggie has faced the strongest villain in the whole manga. He's fighting white walkers while Woolie and Minh are fighting the Lannisters
[2:22:15] <gantzwasprettygood> The instrumental version is better
[2:22:17] <%jiggy_snipe> Reggie should take South America then he can try and fight Wallce again tho I think he needs to grind 1st
[2:22:21] <+ultimafullmetal> Woolie going into Minh's palace right now!
[2:22:32] <%Daba_mk2> yes this is the frieza fight of dokapon

[2:27:49] <JeoDood> could farm items
[2:27:52] <%DaBigVitus> it would be quicker to THINK this instead of saying it
[2:27:54] <lotharrio> I'd try for an item and see if I could get a soul mop

[2:28:28] <%Amaideus> Go to a yellow, give up, then crystal through later on
[2:28:29] <+Mekhet09> I BELIEVE IN YOU WOOLIE.
[2:28:30] <%StaceMcGate> DON'T MISS YOUR CHANCE TO BLOW
[2:28:31] <%Jrocy247> Woolie is so Paranoid about Curse, even though it has a LOW CHANCE
[2:28:33] <Mr_Ease> why are people honestly annoyed by the most interesting part of the game, the decision making
[2:28:35] <alexandrecau> he has a crystal he doesn't need to spin
[2:28:35] <%Amaideus> You can't be hit by spells while given up
[2:28:35] <%heartlesshealer> End the illegal Revival Farm
[2:28:36] <%alpacasintophats> yellow plus giveup?
[2:28:37] <%soFISHticated98> well he might not use spinner

[2:28:47] <%BinaryFireball> I walked into the room at the right time
[2:28:47] <%DaBigVitus> why is he talking like curse will call death?
[2:28:48] <%SchwaAkari> I thought Curse was a half-chance to self-harm but maybe it's lower?
[2:28:48] <%fuji_92> wait minh to be active, then kill him
[2:28:50] <viewtifulr> wheres the timer minh said

[3:51:22] <+GrumbleGrouse> Granada
[3:51:23] <+teavian> GRENADA
[3:51:23] <%jiggy_snipe> REGGIE PLZ
[3:51:24] <Valdorick> Woolie should get a shield
[3:51:25] <$Invlux> and it could duplicate
[3:51:27] <%NeroInfinite> take a town reggie monkaS
[3:51:27] <%Amaideus> Minh can't beat the boss as he is
[3:51:27] <Ultimatefool> TOWN ARC
[3:51:28] <Valdorick> and just grind outside.
[3:51:29] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Leonavius

[3:51:36] <%soFISHticated98> well he can get rid of it if he can dupe an item
[3:51:39] <%Th3SmartAlec> If Woolie leaves he has no way of getting back
[3:51:39] <%jiggy_snipe> finally
[3:51:39] <SGrim> If Reggies just keeps playing the regular game, he might be able to outpace the two slugs.
[3:51:40] <%Amaideus> Better than letting Minh drain his stats for weeks on end
[3:51:49] <%Amaideus> But item drops have made that much less likely
[3:51:56] <%AlteisenReiseZ> And now minh gets grenada
[3:51:56] <%soFISHticated98> how long does the stat drain remain?
[3:51:57] <Xeno351> then you shouldn't have gone to the item space

[4:06:26] <%Irridium> Meanwhile
[4:06:26] <%Amaideus> He doesn't want items
[4:06:28] <Mr_Ease> woolie literally just said it
[4:06:30] <+cvp5127> meanwhile
[4:06:30] <%Irridium> in South America
[4:06:30] <%Amaideus> So he can duplicate it
[4:06:30] <%Jrocy247> Because Minh is GREEDY for MagicMedicine
[4:06:30] <%krispen_wa> He wants to keep his items as low as possible so he can dupe Magic Medicine
[4:06:32] <+zepelinnn1> Minh was never the hero LUL
[4:06:33] <YouKnowThatGuy1> Idk anymore
[4:06:34] <%jiggy_snipe> man these rolls are awful
[4:06:34] <%Amaideus> Come on guys
[4:06:34] <+SinisterStriker> Minh wants to dup the magic medicine so he can one shot
[4:06:35] <%royb2> MEANWHILE
[4:06:36] <%Th3SmartAlec> Miinh is over confident... Woolie still got a chance
[4:06:36] <%crimsonsaens> Why wouldn't he want items?
[4:06:36] <armchairmaster_> Minh why?!
[4:06:39] <%NickHatesSnow> what is with you two and the white space
[4:06:40] <superslacker> He's trying to trigger the dupe chat, pay attention
[4:06:42] <%dollarstored> minh literally had to steal the hero mantle
[4:06:43] <+nekodelic> MAGIC
[4:06:45] <ExileNineteen> i always wondered if the end of the LP was going to be duping magic medicine
[4:06:47] <%Grayhammatter> GRANADA
[4:06:49] <%jiggy_snipe> Minh only wants one item so he can dupe it
[4:06:49] <masterpoloko> back on planet reggie
[4:06:50] <%soFISHticated98> getting a revive is safer though
[4:06:50] <+Dimfish> he wants to dupe his magic meds
[4:06:50] <%royb2> @crimsonsaens He wants to duplicate magic medicine
[4:06:51] <+SaltyGhostRock> Filler Arc LUL
[4:06:51] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Minh admitted to not being the hero and nothing changed
[4:06:52] <%fuji_92> Reggie wants teleports chat
[4:06:52] <%jubejube56> Lol somehow reggie went from filler to main arc back to filler in the course of like 2 turns
[4:06:55] <Equirah> because he wants to guarantee he dupes the medicine
[4:06:56] <%jiggy_snipe> stay at Granada
[4:06:56] <+HelloImTom08> Fools, there are no heros in Dokapon

[4:07:03] <Fanciful_Unicorn> inb4 5 cunning disguises

[4:13:06] <LuckyTerry> MORE CRIMES
[4:13:06] <%tearfuldevil> tbh, i kind of hate the anime/manga distinction; cause as someone who gets a lot out of facecam i have no interest in the anime,, that doesn't have it. the problem is they make the manga with the anime in mind, and lose out on some fun chat interaction
[4:13:08] <Sol_Install> he has a 50% chance tbh
[4:13:08] <%SchwaAkari> The power of DURGS!
[4:13:09] <+Solutha> he has costume too

[4:13:27] <Kuubyy> HOW DOES THE STORY END
[4:13:29] <%Jrocy247> Woolie is WILLING to let Minh take the kill. Because his Monologuing is TELLING HIM TO
[4:13:29] <%therabbles> if woolie lands an attack minh wins next turn if he rolls it
[4:13:29] <%Plus_On_Black> Overthinking is kicking your ass hard.
[4:13:30] <%Amaideus> This would be terrible if they interacted with the chat

[4:14:15] <rubbishbinge> Minh dies to one magic
[4:14:16] <%krispen_wa> Just game the Red Chest until you get Magic Medicine yourself
[4:14:17] <%GenesisKnight> It says double HP
[4:14:19] <Zalthia> Sigh
[4:14:21] <Shinny1338> Inb4 Woolie realizes he has the double stat item

[4:14:38] <%SchwaAkari> I'm trying to be calm but there's so much about the game they don't understand... god bless blind playthroughs
[4:14:38] <+SaltyGhostRock> Side Effects FAM
[4:14:40] <Monkeyweed21> it gives you 1 hp
[4:14:41] <%Jrocy247> It doubles ALL STATS
[4:14:44] <%doombawkzvs> Sid eeffects
[4:14:44] <DedlokPM> @fruit_pie_the_magician if you can't stand the thinking then why even bother watching an lp of a freaking STRATEGY BOARD GAME. THINKING THINGS THROUGH IS PART OF THE EXPERIENCE
[4:14:45] <Monkeyweed21> SIDE EFFECTS
[4:14:46] <%doombawkzvs> LET HIM DIE
[4:14:47] <huskarl_zap> Woolie you can strike first just shoot him
[4:14:47] <%emperordread> Get dokapon Crown then double it
[4:14:47] <flyingtentaclemonster> What does conjure all do btw?
[4:14:50] <%alpacasintophats> health is a stat too
[4:14:50] <+BizarreRevolver> bide your time woolz
[4:14:50] <%kapcommunist> does only last place get the item duplicate?
[4:14:51] <The_err0r> Woolie can predict because he fought this form
[4:14:54] <+fetrigon> @SchwaAkari LUL
[4:14:55] <SGrim> Go in, strike, ???, profit. roo7
[4:14:59] <YouKnowThatGuy1> Side effects aint that bad tho
[4:14:59] <%Grayhammatter> side effects would cripple him if he doesn't one shot
[4:15:00] <BurdRightsActivist> @DedlokPM Don't tell me what to do. :)
[4:15:02] <+Hawk_Rush> STRIKE
[4:15:03] <%Jrocy247> The Side Effect. Is that he has about a WEEK to kill the boss
[4:15:06] <%Th3SmartAlec> Woolie, if Minh can't be stopped, then why make it easier for Minh?'
[4:15:07] <%topendbuzza> woolie fight boss
[4:15:10] <+bizzer10> this game needs a turn timer
[4:15:10] <+Gondab> What's conjour all?
[4:15:10] <%Jrocy247> or he gets 1 HP
[4:15:14] <+Gespens> @flyingtentaclemonster it summons a monster to all players on the map, currently on a yellow space

[4:15:20] <ExileNineteen> @Grayhammatter those side effects take too long to kick in, magic medicine is absolutely busted in this situation
[4:15:20] <DedlokPM> @BurdRightsActivist Then don't tell woolie what to do. It is not your stream
[4:15:21] <+TomDanksEGOT> there are side effects though, and I bet it has something pretty serious/ridic
[4:15:22] <MusouMiko> yeah like I'm p sure minh will kill him within a w eek
[4:15:22] <%Amaideus> @kapcommunist The alchemist class has it happen at random
[4:15:24] <%C4m3r0n0409> Woolie cant make decisions while mind fucked
[4:15:25] <%royb2> @Th3SmartAlec He can avoid that with SOulfiring for 2 turns
[4:15:25] <%emperordread> Unless ... woolieSHOOK
[4:15:26] <Make_me_mad> This game should absolutely penalize you at the end for taking long turns.
[4:15:27] <BurdRightsActivist> @DedlokPM No. :)

[4:17:48] <DedlokPM> @jiggy_snipe Thing is, even with being an aclhemist, he still needs to get the items to dupe. He can't rely on waiting on double rng when minh has most of what he would need now
[4:17:51] <%soFISHticated98> white chest man
[4:17:52] <Twistedwolfie> this is so dumb woolie has no chance aggainst minh if they both farm

[4:18:10] <%soFISHticated98> ring of defense can be good
[4:18:11] <viewtifulr> @hawmaro95 I cant wait for the video edit where it cuts like what 4 hours, of this and maybe 20 mins of action
[4:18:11] <%gatorafan> huh, did Minh used the last Vacuum he had?
[4:18:12] <%SomersaultJustice> eh
[4:18:13] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Woolie collect your thoughts

[4:18:27] <%Amaideus> There's a magic space behind them
[4:18:28] <Xeno351> smart
[4:18:29] <%heartlesshealer> bye good item
[4:18:29] <%jiggy_snipe> @DedlokPM which is fine but it seemed like he was gonna talk himself into attacking Rico. If Minh is gonna do it let him, don't make it easier for him
[4:18:29] <SGrim> But you dodge everything anyway
[4:18:30] <JeoDood> 300 def minh chat
[4:18:30] <%soFISHticated98> yeah but your dodge is too high
[4:18:30] <rubbishbinge> Does Rico's field magic count?
[4:18:31] <+BubbaRands> HOW?!
[4:18:32] <masterpoloko> smart
[4:18:33] <ajrmeps2> ????????????
[4:18:34] <%Amaideus> It's techincally possible, just really unlikely

[4:18:37] <+Dimfish> woolie could get field magic in here

[4:18:44] <%Grayhammatter> oof
[4:18:45] <+cvp5127> meanwhile
[4:18:45] <%Th3SmartAlec> Woolie can potentally kill Minh if he plays his cards right
[4:18:45] <roarofdamnation> the only danger here is if Minh doesn't manages to fight Rico before Magic Medicine wears out, it is a risky gamble, he has to land in the space.
[4:18:46] <worldbrand> I guess he doesnt need it with the medicine
[4:18:46] <ExileNineteen> ResidentSleeper poor reggie

[4:22:22] <zocano> Reggie can win if he gets enough towns in time
[4:22:29] <%Plus_On_Black> Minh is PS5 chilling waiting fir Xbox to move.
[4:22:29] <FeralRageGaming> no body died
[4:22:29] <worldbrand> Woolie aint dead yet
[4:22:31] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @sphiraki on the inside
[4:22:32] <roarofdamnation> Reggie should become an alchemist and got to casino cave
[4:22:33] <%SomersaultJustice> I hope reggie realizes to get towns

[4:22:37] <%tearfuldevil> @sphiraki woolie is slowly dying on the inside
[4:22:37] <%therabbles> if reggie takes the map he can probably win

[4:24:29] <%DashXero> You got obsessed with what you DIDN'T GET.
[4:24:30] <%ShadowpulseKDH1> You need to get spinners Reggie
[4:24:30] <%Grayhammatter> STONKS reggie

[4:24:31] <%Struggleful> Woolie Broken
[4:24:31] <aluddss> you were merely borrowing it from minh
[4:24:31] <redstrawherring> Woolie's Cult of Truth getting repped real hard right now
[4:24:31] <%C4m3r0n0409> GRINDED
[4:24:31] <RurouniGeo> Choosing Green Spaces over Red spaces you can't complain about luck
[4:24:34] <megamonmon123> take the town reggie
[4:24:35] <%doombawkzvs> Minh picked up the napkin first
[4:24:35] <morningmoondude> Being Woolie Is Suffering
[4:24:36] <+Solutha> would minh even fight if woolie left
[4:24:36] <Shinny1338> No luck Woolie it's a set seed
[4:24:37] <+Hawk_Rush> you need to pray harder woolie Kappa
[4:24:37] <%soFISHticated98> Reggie should take Amazon
[4:24:37] <%SchwaAkari> Woolie those shields have a 1-in-10 to land even when they do show up on white spaces
[4:24:37] <%DaBigVitus> shoulda gone red
[4:24:38] <Twistedwolfie> no shit, he has better speed and magic
[4:24:39] <aiutare47> Hoes mad (x46)
[4:24:40] <ExileNineteen> i think, at this point, it would have been better if woolie had LOST to the door guard
[4:24:41] <%soFISHticated98> get those bezoos bucks
[4:24:41] <+doc_ock_rokc> Mihn can't win no matter what
[4:24:43] <SGrim> Steal all them fuckin' town Reggie. YOU GOT THIS!
[4:24:43] <%jillpilled> Minh grabbed the final napkin
[4:24:43] <%jiggy_snipe> lol
[4:24:44] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @PirateHunter99 woolie has no shield and boss is chunky
[4:24:44] <%DashXero> Woolie got tunnel vision
[4:24:46] <Zalthia> And he still hasn’t drunk the thing
[4:24:47] <%jiggy_snipe> Woolie it's fine
[4:24:47] <+SaltyGhostRock> We need the coliseum LUL
[4:24:49] <PleasantLeech> CHANCE
[4:24:49] <%snickers_md> Reggie just be vibing
[4:24:50] <%ShadowpulseKDH1> @lukewarmholiday Same, sadly
[4:24:52] <%therabbles> no one has a decisive win on rico
[4:24:54] <%krispen_wa> Reggie will grind the towns until he wins
[4:24:55] <%heartlesshealer> Reggie: Hero of the People
[4:24:55] <%SchwaAkari> Relying on luck is not how you win a fighting game and you should know that
[4:24:55] <gantzwasprettygood> “I didn’t role 1 out of 16, damn!”
[4:24:56] <JetpackMcQuack> It's easier for Mihn to hurt woolie, than for Woolie to get what he needs
[4:24:56] <%jiggy_snipe> Minh still has to try and idk if he will
[4:24:57] <+KENTASHIRO> The best is going to be if Minh gets the kill but Reggie gets the W because they're fucking around so much
[4:24:58] <hawmaro95> Luck is a skill LUL
[4:24:59] <%C4m3r0n0409> Reggie please go for Rico
[4:24:59] <%ChoculaUltra> Reggie has turned the topside world into his hyperbolic time chamber. But it's on fire.
[4:25:00] <+cvp5127> YES
[4:25:02] <+Hawk_Rush> you gotta do the red
[4:25:03] <thesickestzak> Should've gone red Kappa
[4:25:05] <PirateHunter99> thx
[4:25:07] <Zalthia> Woolie, just walk away. Minh will fail.

[4:25:14] <TigerClaws12> STONKS
[4:25:14] <+doc_ock_rokc> Mihn is too cowardly to fight the boss woolie
[4:25:15] <+itsOnyxLeo> Woolie you could have left, bought an Africa shield and 4spinners, and gotten back to the boss room in the time it took for you to run around in circles! C'mon man!

[4:25:29] <The_err0r> Woolie you could have not been a coward and fight Rico when you still had the luck
[4:25:30] <+Hawk_Rush> dokapon demands it

[4:25:59] <BurdRightsActivist> D OMEGALUL DGE NECKL- oh fuck that would've been close
[4:26:00] <+Hawk_Rush> DUDE
[4:26:02] <%allups> no collusion
[4:26:02] <%jillpilled> Death call would've been rad
[4:26:02] <%kyh9> Why can't Woolie just get good luck?
[4:26:03] <%NickHatesSnow> serum would have fixed his curse
[4:26:09] <%SuperKirby24> monkaS
[4:26:10] <Shinny1338> Did Woolie ever see what Conjure all does?
[4:26:10] <%soFISHticated98> atrophy on bos
[4:26:10] <%SomersaultJustice> ?????????
[4:26:11] <BurdRightsActivist> WOOLIE
[4:26:13] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Woolie should pray more
[4:26:15] <%Th3SmartAlec> Why is Rico not doing shit
[4:26:16] <%heartlesshealer> you never fought, so you don't know
[4:26:17] <%crimsonsaens> Elixir first would've been better
[4:26:20] <Twistedwolfie> go attakc now
[4:26:21] <ExileNineteen> woolie has had good luck on exactly one occasion this session, and that was when his gun procced and killed the guard
[4:26:25] <Kuubyy> PRAY MOTHERFUCKER
[4:26:30] <thesickestzak> Rico feels too bad to do anything
[4:26:30] <ExileNineteen> and that situation led him directly into this one
[4:26:36] <Zalthia> Rico is just waiting
[4:26:42] <@akuda_bar> rico taking a nap
[4:26:44] <%royb2> @ExileNineteen And even that HELPED Minh
[4:26:47] <BurdRightsActivist> Rico will wait 25 turns
[4:26:47] <%Irridium> Reggie in his own world
[4:26:54] <masterpoloko> this is sad
[4:26:55] <%Amaideus> Friendly notification, I'm gonna put up another poll on the subreddit AS SOON AS THIS ENDS
[4:26:55] <ExileNineteen> @royb2 yeah exactly, it opened up the final room for minh
[4:26:58] <%dollarstored> reggies turns are just lifeless
[4:27:00] <Fanciful_Unicorn> This is just Naruto. Woolie is Rock Lee, working hard to grind levels and trying to attain victory, while Minh is Naruto, the chosen child who is destined to win
[4:27:01] <+ultimafullmetal> Kinda wish Rico would just chase you guys down
[4:27:02] <%NickHatesSnow> I'm happy Reggie's turns are here to break up the tension tbh
[4:27:03] <%korth367> blood pool was a mistake
[4:27:05] <Make_me_mad> Dokapon ins Minh's kingdom. You all just live in it.
[4:27:05] <%therabbles> this is a reggie world and we all live in it
[4:27:06] <%C4m3r0n0409> Reggie could probably kill rico first at this point
[4:27:10] <+AsinPersuasion> its hard to tell reggie is playing the same game on the same map
[4:27:16] <Ritei> blood pool was the biggest mistake
[4:27:17] <armchairmaster_> Reggie is literally stuck in africs LUL
[4:27:19] <%tearfuldevil> @Fanciful_Unicorn whose reggie though
[4:27:32] <%dollarstored> LOL

[4:27:52] <%TheBensonator_> WHERE YOU AT GHOST
[4:27:52] <zocano> Reggie can absolutely win if he gets enough time to get towns
[4:27:54] <%jiggy_snipe> he should take every town before he leaves but I feel like he'll just peace out once he gets the store
[4:27:58] <ExileNineteen> @snowcastleframe LUL
[4:27:59] <redstrawherring> @c4m3r0n0409 Reggie's just embodying the spirit of Nintendocaprisun

[4:29:49] <%Grayhammatter> reggie, please
[4:29:49] <+kknutson4> Woolie needs to go in the door and kill some monsters to use up the reveals
[4:29:50] <%royb2> Watch the curse kill Woolie just as he's about to win against Rico
[4:29:52] <+shinichizio> Push Minh for Summer Slam
[4:29:52] <waifoong98> Monopolise them all...
[4:29:52] <%emperordread> you got a town to invest in right there
[4:29:53] <%jillpilled> Reggie deserves to win after all these filler arcs
[4:29:55] <+blademaster247> At least Reggie won't be last
[4:29:56] <ExileNineteen> even though i'm wrong like every 10 mins on the shit i say in this chat Kappa
[4:29:56] <%jiggy_snipe> do not leave SA until you get all those towns
[4:29:56] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli fuck. that's on point
[4:29:57] <bobbyratlair> Reggie is Claude, so who’s Dimitri and who’s Edelgard?
[4:29:58] <worldbrand> you can actually win by actually being a real hero
[4:29:59] <%kekkerscrew> C4m3r0n0409 Reggie is in first place. If he captures enough towns it won't matter who beats rico.
[4:30:01] <%tearfuldevil> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli reggie will open the BEST takoyaki stand
[4:30:01] <%Grayhammatter> invest in balboa
[4:30:04] <funwashere> cant you just use the contract?
[4:30:04] <+SaltyGhostRock> Reggie is the 100 epsiodes of filler after Sasuke vs Naruto LUL
[4:30:06] <Mr_Ease> if woolie procs the dupe on the magic med first he can win

[4:30:08] <+Dimfish> item space i guess
[4:30:09] <vVAstrAVv> i think Reggie doesn't want the bloodpool lol
[4:30:11] <WG101> @bobbyratlair Minh is 100% Edelgard
[4:30:12] <%fuji_92> WOOLIE JUST NEEDS A SHIELD NOW PogChamp
[4:30:15] <%Th3SmartAlec> @kknutson4 I suspect Woolie is sitting such that he can't avoid seeing it every now and then
[4:30:15] <%SuperKirby24> ... anyone else's blood pressure at max? Just me? Kappa
[4:30:15] <%C4m3r0n0409> Reggie is barely in first atm tho
[4:30:16] <+prime_name> @bobbyratlair Minh is Edlegard, Woolie is Dimitri
[4:30:16] <%topendbuzza> none no one is looking at chat
[4:30:17] <roarofdamnation> Man being Team Reggie must suck
[4:30:22] <%Jpshum> invest in balboa
[4:30:23] <%Lionkevinson> how much is the peace pool?
[4:30:24] <%jillpilled> @bobbyratlair Woolie is a good Dimitri fit, punished af.

[4:30:26] <+chiazam> They barely read chat to preserve the anime
[4:30:28] <%Plus_On_Black> You guys need to eat something.
[4:30:28] <thesickestzak> Reggie got greedy and ruined his own plan.
[4:30:28] <Mr_Ease> in fact theres no need for him to proc the dupe, just use it, soul fire, then he has priority
[4:30:29] <%djazo> WOOLIE YOU CAN WIN NOW
[4:30:29] <ExileNineteen> peace pool was like 1.6k
[4:30:32] <%soFISHticated98> Minh is Claude, because he is calculating
[4:30:32] <%Th3SmartAlec> inb4 Blackmail
[4:30:32] <Make_me_mad> @WG101 You're right. He is the best and deserves to win.
[4:30:38] <%Lionkevinson> Thanks
[4:30:39] <%DaBigVitus> reggie needs to move it, the real game waits
[4:30:44] <armchairmaster_> ResidentSleeper
[4:30:46] <%soFISHticated98> Woolie is Dimitri, made blind by rage and depression
[4:30:47] <Tuna_Can_0> why read chat, its just full of salt
[4:30:48] <%kekkerscrew> Yes he's barely in first. But this is his best chancem there's no way he can get to heck before they beat Rico

[4:30:50] <%Amaideus> Woolie can't stall because he has no heal or shield

[4:37:52] <%Th3SmartAlec> @soFISHticated98 I think the idea is that having less items means its mroe likely you dupe what you want
[4:37:52] <thesickestzak> These big important Reggie turns are the best
[4:37:53] <zocano> Reggie can take the win if he gets enough towns
[4:37:54] <%therabbles> Reggie can still win
[4:37:54] <%kekkerscrew> Get the continent then town warp
[4:37:55] <%Goat_Baka> Woolie activated Night Guy before finding Madara
[4:37:56] <+cvp5127> NotLikeThis
[4:37:56] <Zalthia> Being team Reggie is suffering
[4:37:57] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @MrBorisMakarov he fought wallace and got first. just doing town clean up + investing now
[4:37:58] <GDandy> filler arc NotLikeThis
[4:38:02] <+InfiniteHav0k> If Reggie can get every town before someone beats the boss he will win
[4:38:02] <Shinny1338> @alteisenreisez Get rich or die tryibg
[4:38:02] <%Mrthefro> Could you imagine if Reggie wins because the gap is too big at the end.
[4:38:02] <SenhorGordon> What if Rico 3rd form?
[4:38:03] <+Dimfish> @jiggy_snipe i think team woolie is having a harder night tbh
[4:38:03] <+zepelinnn1> ,
[4:38:04] <DerpioParty> If he gets enough towns he may be able to take whatever the reward for Rico is
[4:38:05] <%Grayhammatter> oh my god
[4:38:05] <%Th3SmartAlec> If Reggie wins...
[4:38:06] <%kekkerscrew> NOOO
[4:38:06] <%Jrocy247> LET WOOLIE FOCUS. He needs it
[4:38:08] <%jillpilled> @hawk_rush no kiddin' like this is some unusual levels of suffering D:
[4:38:10] <+itsOnyxLeo> NO
[4:38:10] <%tearfuldevil> @AlteisenReiseZ woolie activated night guy versus Kisame, and now Madara wins the ninja war

[5:14:28] <+ALazo> I really did not expect this to get finished so quickly
[5:14:28] <%kekkerscrew> It's a boardgame no credits
[5:14:29] <%GreatMonorail> Shutting down the win monologue, REALLY?
[5:14:29] <%SuperKirby24> GET THE RUNBACK
[5:14:29] <ExileNineteen> @viewtifulr why? there were like 15 other towns LUL
[5:14:29] <%jiggy_snipe> Reggie was seriously trying to go into heck
[5:14:30] <%jillpilled> what a SHOW jesus thid was a trip
[5:14:30] <arkv01> KNIVES OUT
[5:14:30] <%dangarworld> 2ND GIG
[5:14:30] <Gallhint> woolie would have won if he countered
[5:14:30] <%C4m3r0n0409> IDIOT WOOLIE
[5:14:31] <+DesertPenguin> So, Mnh and WOolie are no longer friends....

[5:14:33] <%Morning_Asakura> season 2 Pog
[5:14:34] <ExpressNode> Should have striked
[5:14:36] <Daxalog> "Auto Counter"
[5:14:38] <+KENTASHIRO> Happy you guys didn't kill each other
[5:14:39] <%arcielardor> NEW GAME PLUS TIME
[5:14:40] <%primax104> Minh the Hewo!
[5:14:42] <heroicspiritavenger> It's over guys, it's all downhill from here
[5:14:42] <huskarl_zap> PAT AND V NEXT
[5:14:42] <%SchwaAkari> Woolie's play should have been Soul Fire -> Give Up as soon as the potion ended, not Attack -> Give Up
[5:14:43] <$Invlux> You did this? I did this.
[5:14:43] <%Kriss1827> Woolie was literally 1 turn away from winning
[5:14:44] <%snickers_md> This wasn't just an LP, this was an experience.
[5:14:44] <derap41> Dokapon failed to ruin friendships
[5:14:45] <+agumon9000> @WoolieVersus You did it way too early
[5:14:45] <lotharrio> Woolie's failure: Soul Fire. Reggie's failure: Not grabbing towns unimpeded.
[5:14:46] <%primax104> *Hero
[5:14:46] <+GrumbleGrouse> So close :(
[5:14:46] <henshin2289> And Woolie will forever regret not striking.
[5:14:47] <heroicspiritavenger> Woolie Vs. has peaked
[5:14:47] <%DaBigVitus> he WOULD have won if he didnt soul fire. amazing
[5:14:48] <YakumoYomi> If Woolie had killed Rico, would Reggie have won or would the towns be enough for Woolie to win?
[5:14:48] <%atema128> What a ride.
[5:14:50] <%djazo> THIS LP WAS AMAZING
[5:14:51] <$QueequegTheater> WOOLIE PAT, V, AND MAX
[5:14:52] <Ritei> @WoolieVersus theres hidden credits on the map as an easter egg
[5:14:52] <thesickestzak> Should've struck NotLikeThis
[5:14:52] <Dalkalopagus> Fantastic playthrough
[5:14:53] <thewrathofscience> leave it to woolie to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory
[5:14:53] <%DianaTheAscian> Not even in fighting games woolie couldn't get out of pools
[5:14:54] <$QueequegTheater> SEASON 2
[5:14:54] <emeraldskrull> woolieDATTEBAYO woolieDATTEBAYO woolieDATTEBAYO
[5:14:55] <+Mr_Brocktoon_Belvedere> This was the Superbowl of lp's lads, thank the three heroes behind it!
[5:15:00] <%Amaideus> Who the fuck was that pink haired character?
[5:15:02] <%heartlesshealer> Soul Fire was the worst move though
[5:15:03] <%DiscoDur0> and then he gave up
[5:15:04] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Rolls fucked you, Woolie, You honestly had that.
[5:15:04] <+DesertPenguin> Woolie you're thinking too much instead of simply doing
[5:15:05] <%LCLSmoothie> thank you woolie
[5:15:06] <%darthvaderwasasimp> Woolie is the vegeta of his own channel confirmed
[5:15:07] <%topendbuzza> 1hp
[5:15:09] <%jiggy_snipe> Rico auto-counters so striking was not the play
[5:15:09] <+DesertPenguin> Soul Fire was useless, just attack
[5:15:09] <Zalthia> I’m so tired
[5:15:10] <%DianaTheAscian> a*
[5:15:10] <ExileNineteen> @Amaideus that's a player char
[5:15:11] <%C4m3r0n0409> Soul fire was dumb
[5:15:11] <%primax104> that was some good shit man
[5:15:14] <armchairmaster_> Woolie to Minh: Mio-Mio, this is the last of my Hamon!
[5:15:15] <%crimsonsaens> Woolie should've moved to a better position first or just attack first
[5:15:18] <%Jrocy247> Minh, who BARELY did main story missions. Trolled the ENTIRE game. Screwed around the most. Won the game at the end......Christ..... NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[5:15:19] <ExileNineteen> @Amaideus pink derpy alchy girl
[5:15:19] <+DesertPenguin> should have just attacked from the start
[5:15:19] <%Irridium> the attack wouldn't have killed, the revert would have happened
[5:15:22] <Zalthia> I’m so tired. I’m going to get food.
[5:15:22] <%SomersaultJustice> the soul fire was a bad idea
[5:15:22] <FeralRageGaming> eighth gate, lasts one week
[5:15:23] <Idon__> THAT BLUE LINE IS MINH LUL
[5:15:24] <bevyrage> holy shit wallace was in the intro the whole time!?
[5:15:24] <+bear_breaker20> s t i n g
[5:15:27] <%CursedNobleman> ALL HAIL MINH.
[5:15:28] <%Kriss1827> 1 TURN AWAY FROM WINNING
[5:15:28] <cobalt_phoenix_> Honestly woolie didn't do anything wrong up until he landed on rico. he got unlucky with his rolls after drinking the potion
[5:15:29] <%phatmac16> THAT WOULD'VE BEEN A GREAT END
[5:15:31] <Kuubyy> It's all over.
[5:15:31] <+DesertPenguin> yea you can, you let minh steal it
[5:15:31] <%Amaideus> I take those, thanks y'all
[5:15:32] <%0rond> 750 did a bit over half, 999 wouldn't have killed
[5:15:33] <derap41> The True Victory is that you didn't en up hating each other
[5:15:33] <BurdRightsActivist> @Jrocy247 Undertaker wins
[5:15:34] <%stote45> that shit was epic
[5:15:34] <masterp_91> @Jrocy247 yeah, shit sucks
[5:15:34] <%C4m3r0n0409> Woolie should have just not attacked
[5:15:35] <%dogwelder02> Woolie, you had the win. Stop monologuing
[5:15:35] <thewrathofscience> all woolie had to do is strike
[5:15:37] <+Zayasu> intro spoiled minh winning Kappa
[5:15:37] <Aydarkzero> the intro knew!
[5:15:39] <%iswearimjustdandy> I have never felt this much disappointment in my life, it was worth it
[5:15:39] <@Solidus_113> Imagine if you striked
[5:15:41] <gantzwasprettygood> Game’s over chat, don’t worry about the “should haves”
[5:15:42] <%ShadowpulseKDH1> Should have just started by attacking
[5:15:43] <%MaverickJoker> GG
[5:15:43] <SenhorGordon> If you had the gun, the thunder could've killed him
[5:15:43] <%Amaideus> He should've waited one more turn to get closer
[5:15:43] <%Camail> side effect is 1 hp
[5:15:44] <+SaltyGhostRock> Woolie was right
[5:15:44] <OhNoAndrej> magnificent LP
[5:15:44] <%heartlesshealer> I will never worship Delita
[5:15:45] <+Saggitori> What is mihn going to spend his blood money on?

[5:17:12] <+DesertPenguin> This isn't a "just a game" moment
[5:17:14] <ExileNineteen> @ExpressNode 4k to minh, woolie and reggie split the peace pool for around $800 each
[5:17:14] <%MaverickJoker> DIO MINH WINS
[5:17:14] <%countgaculatv> Minh was right, fuck being a hero.
[5:17:16] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Glad I watched this. I can't trust people to stfu about this finale
[5:17:17] <%GreatMonorail> How are people thinking that minh didn't know one thing and now didn't deserve to win
[5:17:17] <SGrim> Woolie, if you'd countered and won. That would have been magic.
[5:17:17] <%Kriss1827> We were the real winners here chat lets be honest
[5:17:17] <%Jrocy247> You should've kept the gun
[5:17:17] <%tearfuldevil> @ExpressNode there wasn't a bet, its a pool of chat donations
[5:17:18] <RurouniGeo> @f4ntom98 or because he read the youtube comments and got tips and information Reggie and Woolie didn't have
[5:17:18] <%TheBensonator_> That 1 was GOAT, but then... ye
[5:17:18] <%Daba_mk2> the soul fire man
[5:17:18] <%NickHatesSnow> but you didn't risk the dodge
[5:17:19] <%jiggy_snipe> even then Reggie just needed to take towns while they were in heck
[5:17:19] <+BizarreRevolver> should have kept gun
[5:17:20] <rubbishbinge> No damage multiplier on the doka sword gg
[5:17:23] <%alpacasintophats> Y'all saying Hoes Mad and all. Y'all are correct. I AM AN EXTREMELY MAD HOE!
[5:17:23] <armchairmaster_> Minh- Kappa Reggie- ResidentSleeper Woolie- NotLikeThis
[5:17:24] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I had a feeling Minh would win, but alas, I was Team Reggie
[5:17:24] <cobalt_phoenix_> guys relax i didin't want Minh to win but in the end the bad rolls led to where we're at
[5:17:25] <%CursedNobleman> Nobody remembers Might Guy. Everyone remembers Naruto and Sasuke. Bitch breaks his legs and doesnt even get a statue.
[5:17:25] <heroicspiritavenger> Bans?
[5:17:28] <RetroCop87> That feel when you realize that Woolie would have won if he striked instead of attacked
[5:17:31] <%doombawkzvs> If he had kept the gun
[5:17:31] <huskarl_zap> OBITO WON
[5:17:31] <%SchwaAkari> Also if Woolie had not soul-fired at all he'd have probably been able to two-shot with his Reveals and win
[5:17:34] <+el_boney> Minh didn't win, Woolie lost for everyone
[5:17:36] <%Grayhammatter> i'm more disappointed in reggie
[5:17:36] <%doombawkzvs> He might've gotten the double hit
[5:17:37] <+cvp5127> evil wins
[5:17:38] <@Moobot> Easy with the emojis @samuraijakanddaxter
[5:17:39] <JeoDood> if woolie keep the gun he could double shot it
[5:17:40] <%soFISHticated98> @RetroCop87 auto counter idiot
[5:17:40] <masterp_91> @el_boney this
[5:17:40] <%AlteisenReiseZ> This honestly might just go down in LP history
[5:17:40] <worldbrand> minh's going to get into smash before woolie at this point
[5:17:41] <+BubbaRands> Sometimes the Villain wins...
[5:17:43] <+AsinPersuasion> why aren't people allowed to be mad their team didn't win
[5:17:43] <xxshadowxx416> coward minh wins
[5:17:45] <%MaverickJoker> Exactly, EVIL WINS
[5:17:48] <CrypticMochi> Commission character statues
[5:17:48] <%soFISHticated98> all the bosses automatically counter your strikes
[5:17:51] <SenhorGordon> The soul fire made you lose sadly
[5:17:51] <%jiggy_snipe> @Grayhammatter that's how Team Reggie feels
[5:17:51] <%MaverickJoker> TRUE HERO MINH WINS Kappa
[5:17:52] <%primax104> Good game guys
[5:17:52] <Xeno351> I SO HAPPY LUL
[5:17:52] <zocano> Evil has won.
[5:17:53] <+DesertPenguin> I'm mad that Minh won it the way he did
[5:17:54] <%soFISHticated98> you literally cannot strike them
[5:17:54] <+AsinPersuasion> let the people seethe
[5:17:55] <ExileNineteen> be mad, don't be toxic
[5:17:55] <%GreatMonorail> Woolie couldn't have striked, lol chat is dumb
[5:17:56] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> THIS IS HOW BERSERK ENDS
[5:17:57] <masterp_91> Woolie could have won be he felt bad.
[5:17:58] <+DesertPenguin> Like a little shit
[5:17:58] <%fuji_92> THIS ANIME ENDED FOR ME WHEN WOOLIE HIT THE 1
[5:17:58] <dickbuttwoman> He has auto-counter confirmed
[5:17:59] <aluddss> this chat PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt
[5:18:00] <OhNoAndrej> Superb LP, guys! Congrats on completing it!
[5:18:00] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> GRIFFITH WINS
[5:18:01] <%tearfuldevil> @AsinPersuasion you can be amd, but don't be a shit about it
[5:18:02] <%nintega010> @WoolieVersus I'm still on your team woolie It was a fun ride
[5:18:02] <+paulblart1911> 2020 SUCKS
[5:18:03] <%DiscoDur0> Dokapon netplay is now at its peak
[5:18:03] <%Camail> you'd have to restrict the counter
[5:18:03] <%primax104> Instant classic LP
[5:18:05] <%Jrocy247> Yea, I think Woolie should've kept the Gun. He had that chance for the extra damage.
[5:18:07] <%NickHatesSnow> #TeamMinh4TheWin
[5:18:07] <worldbrand> the boss 100% has auto-counter, as do most bosses
[5:18:08] <%MaverickJoker> GRIFFITH DID NOTHING WRONG
[5:18:12] <%Kriss1827> @Fujiwara_92 AGREED
[5:18:14] <bashful_bard> All the bosses major auto counter
[5:18:14] <%C4m3r0n0409> Woolie doing dumb shit threw the game
[5:18:14] <cobalt_phoenix_> Holy fuck people still think Strike was an option? Guys the boss auto counters. All bosses auto counter.
[5:18:15] <%Struggleful> Smasher level's of irrational anger LUL
[5:18:16] <+Mekhet09> The problem is the second soul fire.
[5:18:16] <%MaverickJoker> LUL
[5:18:16] <JeoDood> TEAM MINH
[5:18:17] <RetroCop87> @soFISHticated98 dial back the salt a bit, ya?
[5:18:18] <%dogwelder02> Woolie shouldn't have hit the boss at all
[5:18:21] <%SchwaAkari> Dokapon Kingdom SECOND GIG LET'S GO
[5:18:21] <lotharrio> Minh still won by the strategy we all knew he was using.
[5:18:22] <%SuperKirby24> I'm assuming the anime ended when woolie rolled the one Kappa
[5:18:25] <Fanciful_Unicorn> @samuraijakanddaxter wouldn't matter, woulda taken half his health, maybe and then he would be back to original attack and not hit hard enough to kill
[5:18:26] <%soFISHticated98> salt? I am on top of the world
[5:18:27] <%sorakirosaki1> this match has been awesome
[5:18:27] <%GreatMonorail> #TeamMinhWinh
[5:18:28] <%jiggy_snipe> LP was great. Would have been better Reggie and Woolie played like Minh
[5:18:28] <%soFISHticated98> Minh won
[5:18:29] <RenegadeEpsilon> wools won in my heart
[5:18:30] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Minh, please buy the Night Guy statue with the blood pool
[5:18:31] <ExpressNode> Welp that was fun regardless, game guys
[5:18:31] <%jillpilled> I was surprised about the towns being basically worthless to acquire as long as someone beats Rico
[5:18:32] <%fuji_92> NOW I WANNA A NIGHT WOOLIE STATUE
[5:18:32] <+BubbaRands> So when do I get a t-shirt for this? Kappa
[5:18:33] <%kappacino2020> this LP will definitely go down in history
[5:18:35] <%soFISHticated98> #Minh4theWin
[5:18:37] <JeoDood> Minh still won by the strategy we all knew he was using
[5:18:38] <huskarl_zap> The dark millennium has begun
[5:18:40] <%dogwelder02> taking it down to half health was a terrible idea
[5:18:42] <%kapcommunist> it came down to using the magic potion 1 turn too early
[5:18:44] <%Camail> reggie fucked up going for the local item value
[5:18:44] <DarkestDom> rbeeG rbeeG rbeeG rbeeG rbeeG rbeeG rbeeG rbeeG rbeeG rbeeG
[5:18:45] <gastherobots> Woolie would have won if he landed. Reggie would have won if he just took the ice towns. But Minh knew the game, Minh knew when and where to be.
[5:18:46] <+Velloriaa> Worth staying up till 1am for
[5:18:46] <+AnthraxJohnson> #Minh4TheWin
[5:18:47] <+shuratheawesome> Good job on the lp guys! You all are real champs for sticking with it!
[5:18:48] <%soFISHticated98> I've been saying this shit since the lava cave days
[5:18:52] <The_err0r> Btw I’m pretty sure Rico doesn’t auto counter
[5:18:54] <kkjingles> Minh becomes a dictator
[5:18:55] <%gatorafan> This last sesion on YouTube is going to be wild
[5:18:56] <+DesertPenguin> HE should have healed, that shit is fucking busted
[5:18:57] <armchairmaster_> Minh must use the Blood Money to buy a statue of Guy activating the 8th Gate
[5:18:57] <+paulblart1911> THE DARK AGE BEGINS
[5:18:59] <ExileNineteen> @spiritofmojave i don't understand. if reggie would have been taking more towns he'd have won
[5:19:02] <Decimated_body> #MinhforWin
[5:19:02] <%fuji_92> WHERE'S MY NIGHT POCKETS STATUE WITH THE END ON IT
[5:19:04] <%Jrocy247> Minh won by Trolling. That was he strategy the ENTIRE game. LUL
[5:19:04] <samuraijakanddaxter> anyway congrats minh he played the smartest throughout
[5:19:07] <%pietrowaffleton> he def autocounters
[5:19:07] <ExileNineteen> towns are the whole game
[5:19:07] <%Struggleful> Woolie and Reggie were playing kinda dumb a lot of the time
[5:19:13] <gantzwasprettygood> lol @ chat going “woolie/reggie should’ve” game’s over lads
[5:19:16] <%CursedNobleman> NO MORE HEROES.
[5:19:17] <nothuzad> #MihMaxing
[5:19:17] <%soFISHticated98> #minh4thewin
[5:19:18] <Fanciful_Unicorn> Reggie definitely could have won had he just taken all the towns
[5:19:19] <bashful_bard> Minh would've won even if woolie hadn't hurt Rico
[5:19:21] <%C4m3r0n0409> Reggie played like an idiot at the end
[5:19:23] <%Grayhammatter> nice job minh
[5:19:24] <%jiggy_snipe> @Camail nope, that's why the king liked him. He needed to take towns while they were in heck messing around
[5:19:31] <%SomersaultJustice> so what's the final number for the pools?
[5:19:31] <rubbishbinge> Reggie could've won if he took towns to boost his castle value
[5:19:32] <%TheBensonator_> Anyone could have won, because video games
[5:19:32] <%Amaideus> Any one of them could've won
[5:19:34] <gastherobots> Not saying Minh cheated or anything stupid like that, just saying Minh was the best at the game.
[5:19:34] <huskarl_zap> The Dark Mihnillium has begun.
[5:19:35] <%pectusumbra> a second round of this would be very different, but let's be real, NEVER happening
[5:19:35] <+DesertPenguin> JUst imagine how Minh would be acting if he lost.
[5:19:37] <%Jrocy247> Reggie screwed around too much, so he had no chance.
[5:19:38] <%NormalGuy> In the anime it's revealed that Rico is Woolie's brother and he gets stabbed in the shock of that realization
[5:19:39] <Mr__Jebus> I was rooting for reggie but i think minh absolutely played the smartest
[5:19:40] <Ritei> reggie played badly for the entire game
[5:19:46] <ExileNineteen> it's very easy for chat to play for any one of them. we have both no emotional investment and 20/20 hindsight
[5:19:46] <%jillpilled> @exilenineteen well, at the end there apparently oncr Minh won, he automatically grabbed all of Reggie's towns.
[5:19:47] <+Hawk_Rush> @NormalGuy LUL
[5:19:47] <%tearfuldevil> @Struggleful yeah minh didn't play amazing consistently, but his strategy over time, and in the last moments, won him the game
[5:19:48] <morningmoondude> Mihn simply outplayed everyone at every step. He mihnimized the bullshit.
[5:19:48] <$Invlux> cheer500 Congrats guys on a great game, here's some consolation money for the Peace Pool if it's still open. Can't wait for Dokapon Kingdom - 2nd Gig! Now hug it out, GG
[5:19:48] <Ritei> and somehow still wasnt last place
[5:19:49] <%soFISHticated98> Minh has never insulted them
[5:19:50] <%C4m3r0n0409> I wish Woolie waited until he got in the loop to use magic medicine
[5:19:51] <Valdorick> Woolie shoulda just soul fired then countered.
[5:19:52] <JeoDood> REGGIE WAS FILLER
[5:19:53] <%Amaideus> "I've come to make an announcement"
[5:19:55] <+Dimfish> reggie played smart towards the end but it fucked him over
[5:19:56] <Fanciful_Unicorn> charity
[5:19:57] <%Amaideus> HE'S SPREADING IT
[5:19:57] <%kyh9> He's gonna split it

[5:27:23] <huskarl_zap> Lol
[5:27:23] <%glass_marcus> honestly that rico block was unfortunate
[5:27:27] <%kapcommunist> about 6 million behind?

[5:27:29] <XrosHawk> So when is Dokapon 2nd Gig?
[5:27:29] <%nintega010> Season 2 would be awhile. Maybe they could add punch mom for season 2 @WoolieVersus

[5:27:51] <+Mr_Brocktoon_Belvedere> Produced by Hideki Kamiya
[5:27:51] <%Mrthefro> Reggie was certainly a player in the game
[5:27:53] <ExileNineteen> the ice continent was 4 towns out of like 20
[5:27:54] <%gatorafan> Kinda hard to think Salt Party involved OTHER GAMES besides Dokapon....
[5:27:56] <+Mekhet09> Reggie could have just won if he just started earlier.

[5:30:02] <%doombawkzvs> Cheer500 For the last time, here's to some good ass Dokapon. To the Dark Hero Reggie whose lust for adventure was matched only by his love of wandering. To the Gutsy Lost Soldier Woolie, who clawed his way through hell and levied the blow which allowed the demon lord to fall. To the villain Minh, whose mind and luck let him land the final blow on the demon. Not all will understand, but all who bore witness know that there will never be another adventure... until the next time, that is.
[5:30:04] <rubbishbinge> Needed to boost his castles to max value

[5:49:43] <%jiggy_snipe> but then the rolls lol
[5:49:45] <zocano> Ya screwed by rolls
[5:49:46] <%Jrocy247> We know, The doubt was correct
[5:49:49] <thesickestzak> Greedy Reggie lol
[5:49:51] <mield916> do fortune street next
[5:50:00] <lotharrio> Reggie getting trapped underwater for like.. 5 turns was rough.
[5:50:00] <Xeno351> except when he bumbled the behelit
[5:50:00] <armchairmaster_> So in this part, Woolie threw away the Pat sword and opened the 8th Gate to help seal away a demon.
[5:50:01] <zocano> Honestly the rolls screwed you but you coulda got real close
[5:50:02] <%pietrowaffleton> FORTUNE STREET IS GREAT
[5:50:03] <%Amaideus> If Reggie hadn't got terrible rolls he totally could've been the winner

[5:50:26] <rubbishbinge> I can't believe WoolieVS is a sugoroku channel now
[5:50:26] <%Amaideus> But in the end, he bumblefucked himself out of victory yet again
[5:50:29] <bashful_bard> The legendary plan
[5:50:37] <%Jrocy247> If Reggie didn't go after Wallace, his plan would've worked
[5:50:53] <rubbishbinge> Not a guaranteed win though
[5:50:55] <thesickestzak> Reggie's biggest enemy always and forever is Reggie
[5:50:55] <%jiggy_snipe> if the rolls weren't bad
[5:51:02] <%jiggy_snipe> and you cleared SA faster maybe
[5:51:05] <%pectusumbra> wallace put him in first though. It was a good choice.
[5:51:08] <gastherobots> If this causes a Dokapon sequel/remaster like Metal Wolf XD I'll lose my shit.
[5:51:12] <%pectusumbra> it was really close

[5:53:07] <undimcundi> Naw, total Simp.
[5:53:12] <rubbishbinge> 20 levels
[5:53:12] <%darthvaderwasasimp> Totally a simp
[5:53:15] <%jiggy_snipe> lol
[5:53:15] <arkv01> shank woolie while he's down D:
[5:53:22] <%GenesisKnight> Learn what the fuck a simp is
[5:53:34] <%tearfuldevil> simp doesn't mean anything
[5:53:35] <ExileNineteen> it's a stupid word anyway
[5:53:43] <%tearfuldevil> its about as meaningless as cuck at this point
[5:53:43] <%jiggy_snipe> simp is so overused now
[5:53:52] <%jiggy_snipe> people don't even know how to use it properly
[5:53:56] <%darthvaderwasasimp> The fact that you're getting upset about it is reason enough for the name honestly
[5:53:58] <%fuji_92> simp became a buzz word y'all mad on nothing LUL
[5:53:59] <%MaverickJoker> Doesn't change the meaning of it, no matter how much distilled the water is
[5:54:08] <%tearfuldevil> it kind of does
[5:54:12] <%MaverickJoker> the N word used to mean nothing
[5:54:15] <%MaverickJoker> remember that?
[5:54:15] <arkv01> please now is not the time to discuss semantics, now is a time for celebration
[5:54:18] <%Amaideus> What kind of dumbfuck idiocy is that
[5:54:19] <%pietrowaffleton> it comes from simpleton
[5:54:22] <+prime_name> Would it be too fair for the game to let you use an item after you roll to move?
[5:54:27] <%MaverickJoker> remember when the N word meant nothing?
[5:54:32] <%Amaideus> Simp doesn't come from simpleton, ffs
[5:54:32] <zocano> If Woolie's rolls woulda gone his way it probably woulda been Woolie instaed
[5:54:32] <dickbuttwoman> If he waited 1 more turn to pop medi, he would have won
[5:54:34] <@akuda_bar> let's talk about purple chat instead.

[5:55:00] <+projectmanatees> Droml water
[5:55:01] <thewrathofscience> "Simp" getting popular is the worst thing to happen to the term
[5:55:05] <%Jrocy247> That's what happens when people a abuse a word. It loses all meaning and people just throwing it around for wrong reasons
[5:55:05] <%C4m3r0n0409> Woolie using MM made me upset
[5:55:10] <Leonavius> not too salty, only momentarily

[6:02:28] <huskarl_zap> Total War: Dokapon Kingdom TM

[6:02:32] <%SomersaultJustice> is Reggie Orlandeau?
[6:02:34] <%Andrizzleton> who won?
[6:02:35] <arkv01> oh yeah he killed her nvm
[6:02:42] <lotharrio> Legit though, if Reggie had taken the towns and won the "political" victory, he'd have been even more on point as Delita, since that's basically what Delita does while Ramza saves the world.

[6:06:51] <%pectusumbra> I witnessed this end
[6:06:52] <%jiggy_snipe> turns out it's probably the most popular stream
[6:06:53] <@Solidus_113> You said the cut episode sucked, because the mode you picked

[6:07:16] <%DappercatEsquire> In the end you got a cool 2k each
[6:07:17] <AlfredoCavatelli> why does woolie hate video games?
[6:07:22] <%tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus why did you say that Dokapon is terrible and the game should have never been made Kappa
[6:07:25] <Xeno351> I can't belive pat said he hates dokapon
[6:07:29] <%DatAsuna> This definitely hits harder live as well
[6:07:34] <%pectusumbra> que "I can't believe woolie shit-talk dokapon around mouthfuls of raw meat"

[6:07:43] <Rhinoprotoss> I'm unsubscribing from AngriestPat
[6:07:45] <gastherobots> Random thought but since I've been reading it, I would kill for a stylized history the Dokapon LP in the style of Le Morte d'Arthur... honestly I might write to pass the time.
[6:07:46] <%MichaelDood> doodBait
[6:07:49] <$QueequegTheater> "It sucked" he just said it
[6:07:52] <%SomersaultJustice> oh woolie, that's gonna happen no matter what you say Kappa

[6:07:59] <+prime_name> Clip him saying it sucked
[6:08:00] <%krispen_wa> I can't believe Woolie stole that Dokapon while killing that guy over pie
[6:08:02] <%DianaTheAscian> the view count is still very high (especially compared too death stranding)

[6:09:00] <gbrincks> Dokapon teaches atheism like Doom does satanism
[6:09:01] <gastherobots> @tearknack Le Morte D'Woolie for the canon ending of him dying when the castle collapses
[6:09:04] <%C4m3r0n0409> Doesn't matter who won they split the money
[6:09:04] <%crossing_mao> So who Is gonna make the best moments compilation?
[6:09:05] <ChinMusicTwo> Dokapon is basically life's choas condensed into a 100hr party rpg game
[6:09:05] <ExileNineteen> dude, if the guy from the youtube comments on one of the vids that wrote the infinite squall works
[6:09:06] <%Amaideus> Life is transient eh

[6:09:22] <ExileNineteen> i read that like 10 times
[6:09:27] <%DianaTheAscian> the 90% doge was still hype for me
[6:09:27] <%glass_marcus> Minh stealing the passports was the sickest play handsdown
[6:09:31] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> JA RULE
[6:09:34] <%soFISHticated98> but nobody was asking what Reggie was going to do
[6:09:35] <%DianaTheAscian> dodge*
[6:09:38] <@akuda_bar> oh god I was there for that
[6:09:39] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> REMEMBER JA RULEJA RUL
[6:09:43] <%djazo> THE HERO.S SHIELD WAS THE BEST
[6:09:44] <@akuda_bar> when they were singing Battle for Everyone's Souls
[6:09:45] <@Solidus_113> Kamina
[6:09:50] <%SomersaultJustice> luda put in work
[6:09:53] <+Dimfish> my favorite was darkling reggie on danue with the come here give up meta
[6:09:54] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Remember the heroes of Indigo Plateau
[6:09:56] <%jiggy_snipe> the 91% dodge was when I knew Reggie was a shonen protag
[6:10:00] <%Amaideus> I enjoyed Reggie's godly 91% dodge
[6:10:02] <%Amaideus> YEYEYE
[6:10:06] <%Amaideus> You get it!
[6:10:16] <%coldfire0007> Nuzlocke was so good
[6:10:16] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[6:10:21] <%glass_marcus> That was just Gyrp Zepelli using ball breaker
[6:10:21] <JeoDood> wat if woolie keeps the gun and got the double shot on the boss
[6:10:21] <thesickestzak> Those wieners in the YouTube comments complaining about Minh "cheating" are going to be so salty 4Head
[6:10:28] <%Amaideus> That entire sequence of events for Reggie to get in there was AMAZING
[6:10:33] <JeoDood> final boss
[6:10:47] <rubbishbinge> What was Minh's weapon at the end?
[6:10:52] <%DatAsuna> That would have been a hard throw yeah
[6:10:53] <%C4m3r0n0409> Woolie mightve won with gun
[6:10:54] <%Amaideus> Lich staff I think
[6:10:55] <ExileNineteen> minh had his underworld staff still
[6:10:56] <%soFISHticated98> the Lich's staff
[6:10:57] <%Amaideus> Something like that
[6:10:58] <%soFISHticated98> don't remember the name
[6:11:03] <TigerClaws12> LUL
[6:11:06] <%krispen_wa> Woolie getting the Dokapon Sword and the Hero Shield and the Night Guy powerup only to fail was the most poetic thing ever
[6:11:07] <%optimasmaximas> ma digga
[6:11:09] <%soFISHticated98> yeah underworld staff
[6:11:09] <%Amaideus> OH
[6:11:12] <rubbishbinge> Ah, he out damaged Woolie with class bonus then
[6:11:12] <%Jpshum> LUL
[6:11:13] <%Amaideus> The wabbit counter then
[6:11:16] <%jiggy_snipe> yea that changed everything
[6:11:16] <ExileNineteen> and he failed by ONE TURN
[6:11:17] <JeoDood> Woolie mightve won with gun
[6:11:19] <rubbishbinge> Good shit
[6:11:29] <Oxybe> Minh's weapon was guile
[6:11:29] <%optimasmaximas> wallace being so strong still befuddles me
[6:11:31] <ExileNineteen> like, yeah, there were lots of good moments but nothing beats the last hour or so
[6:11:32] <rilou501> Hydro cannon was hype as shit. RIP Luda
[6:11:34] <%C4m3r0n0409> Reggie luck was crazy
[6:11:37] <%DatAsuna> I like reggie robbing the shop to get the exact same shield he already had
[6:11:45] <%DiscoDur0> That dodge was insane!
[6:11:45] <@akuda_bar> it was super funny with everyone spamming 1
[6:11:46] <%C4m3r0n0409> 91% lol
[6:11:53] <%crimsonsaens> Minh's staff was called the Underworld Staff
