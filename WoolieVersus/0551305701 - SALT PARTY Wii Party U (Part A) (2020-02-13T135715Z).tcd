I had a lucid dream this morning, and it freaked me the fuck out because it involved me pulling a botfly larva out of my wrist. When I woke up, I had to check my wrist to make sure it was not infested!
[0:15:12] <plushysceptile> The salt party continues
[0:15:14] <+Toblo1> Like dream will swerve into something I recognize then the *MILISECOND* I go "wait I'm dreaming aren't I?" it fucking ends

[0:17:15] <+dayz1003> yeah no one wants that @Wool :(
[0:17:16] <%wolfofsound> sounded fine before the game was launched
[0:17:16] <%Prevot> cripsy
[0:17:18] <%DatAsuna> Crunchy as in lots of skipping and compression

[0:17:42] <%CJett92> You guys are good, just game
[0:17:43] <+einheri> Your voices are smooth
[0:17:44] <BallerSwagBro9k> Big audio stutter OOF
[0:17:46] <shotgang86> before the game launched it was ok
[0:17:47] <DracaenaLeaf> your own video is a little choppy though too
[0:17:50] <VJdarkworld> game audio sounds like a chopped n screwed remix
[0:17:55] <redrins> game but camera had some slight skips
[0:17:58] <+MrAtheGreat> Cam is skipping frames too
[0:17:59] <@chesterr01> @invisi_bliss âœŠðŸ‘Š
[0:18:00] <%IMDRanged> Should've invited Pat on this one
[0:18:04] <BlkFlameKami> lol
[0:18:26] <velestionhammer> This muppet guy looks perpetually disappointed.
[0:18:26] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:18:36] <psidefx> The peaks
[0:18:53] <+Xpheius> PowerUpL murderPog PowerUpR
[0:18:59] <Ghost__Pantsu> Video is chopping too or low framerate hmm
[0:19:18] <+TitaniumDragoonNeo> nah you're good. new setup and all that
[0:19:19] <$burgersama_dlx> PokPikachu
[0:19:24] <$cureneckbeard> hold on
[0:19:26] <SleepDeprived42> Perfect game for Woolie. Kiirby. Duh.
[0:19:29] <@Squdnate> Then it's the bitrate
[0:19:29] <redrins> could it be the bitrate?
[0:19:42] <@Solidus_113> Check that task manager
[0:19:43] <Ghost__Pantsu> Bitrate probs
[0:19:47] <themightyquinn3000> Hi Woolie
[0:20:18] <%wolfofsound> woolie stop your shadman torrent
[0:20:29] <+TitaniumDragoonNeo> It likely is a bitrate issue.
[0:20:31] <+Javaa01> Check task manager and look at what speed your CPU is running at, cause of something like thermal throttling or whatever
[0:20:32] <@Solidus_113> the bitrate is still 4500, it's been fine before
[0:20:41] <$burgersama_dlx> how many tabs ya got open? atpCap
[0:20:55] <+MrProw> If it were bitrate then wouldn't their voices be choppy as well? :s
[0:20:57] <%invisi_bliss> LUL
[0:21:02] <redrins> @burgersama_dlx not enough
[0:21:07] <NeroInfinite> mmm that choppy game audio
[0:21:15] <$burgersama_dlx> @redrins nani?!
[0:21:20] <$cureneckbeard> too high res
[0:21:23] <$cureneckbeard> 4k woolie was a mistake
[0:21:29] <@Solidus_113> the voices are fine, but the game audio is crunchy, and the camera footage is skipping frames @WoolieVersus
[0:21:29] <DaKnightWarrior> EarthDay PowerUpL TheIlluminati
[0:21:31] <wanocountry> !Uptime
[0:21:31] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 32 minutes and 50 seconds
[0:21:35] <+Ryu_R> minh looks pat sized LUL
[0:21:40] <Potatoidea> Cam setup looks really good
[0:21:52] <@Squdnate> The recommended bitrate for streaming 1080p is also between 5000 and 6000
[0:21:57] <+MrAtheGreat> As an amatuer streamer, this shit is gold to me. Teach me sensei!
[0:21:57] <Aussie_Manny> @Ryu_R But Minh's legs actually have a bend tho.
[0:22:01] <@Squdnate> 4500 is just a bit under for that performance
[0:22:04] <+Ryu_R> true
[0:22:05] <NeroInfinite> 4k Woolie is a mistake
[0:22:11] <Potatoidea> Aside from the tech issues, though
[0:22:43] <Aussie_Manny> Holy shit, I'm streaming at 480p, but these scrubs look SO SHARP! PogChamp
[0:22:49] <@Solidus_113> the same
[0:22:50] <+TitaniumDragoonNeo> nope
[0:22:51] <BlkFlameKami> still crunch
[0:22:52] <some_sunflowers> is bad.
[0:22:53] <%Irridium> same
[0:22:53] <+MrProw> still bad
[0:22:56] <+Javaa01> Yeah, big chops
[0:22:56] <SurgicalAssassin> still choppy
[0:22:57] <DaKnightWarrior> still choppy
[0:22:57] <%Irridium> as in still not good
[0:22:59] <NeroInfinite> cwispy
[0:23:00] <%That_Mojo> crackling audio ?
[0:23:01] <scrumbotime> crunchitized
[0:23:09] <redrins> do as squd said and bump the bitrate
[0:23:12] <kuningaz45> check sound equalization
[0:23:17] <%That_Mojo> cables?
[0:23:19] <$cureneckbeard> is the camera choppy video framerate for anyone else or is it just my PC sucks
[0:23:25] <%valriot> It literally just sounds like a plug is loose on the actual WiiU
[0:23:32] <Zayasu> @cureneckbeard for me too
[0:23:33] <NeroInfinite> jus t yer pc I'm afraid
[0:23:40] <%That_Mojo> roger that
[0:23:40] <@Solidus_113> Camera could be taking up too much power
[0:23:41] <liflamor> or maybe the sound is just naturally crappy
[0:23:42] <+Ryu_R> just emulate it Kappa
[0:24:02] <bushbabyomega> Does the game need an update?
[0:24:02] <+DeeJayOkay> E G G M A N
[0:24:06] <$burgersama_dlx> could it be the wii u?
[0:24:06] <+MrAtheGreat> Itâ€™s output issues I think.
[0:24:13] <giogio346> @WoolieVersus the camera is also a bit choppy
[0:24:21] <@Squdnate> @WoolieVersus See your CPU usage. And crank the bitrate to at least 5000
[0:24:26] <@Solidus_113> yes
[0:24:27] <DracaenaLeaf> Yeah
[0:24:28] <VJdarkworld> yeah
[0:24:29] <zmuno> yes
[0:24:29] <Sedrelic> YE
[0:24:29] <+MrProw> very yes
[0:24:31] <%Solidnick18> nothing can ever work FeelsBadMan
[0:24:31] <+Javaa01> Yeah, it is somewhat choppy
[0:24:32] <+MrAtheGreat> Not enough band width maybe
[0:24:32] <%Irridium> your camera yeah game is fine
[0:24:34] <NeroInfinite> Yep
[0:24:34] <$burgersama_dlx> maybe its TOO high quality
[0:24:34] <Phalanx_Soul> did you try turning it off and on
[0:24:36] <%Solidnick18> yeah
[0:24:48] <%CJett92> Game video and your audio is good, Game audio and your video is chunky
[0:24:56] <@Solidus_113> You've skipped 1071 frames since the start of the stream
[0:24:57] <Reizie_Etherealm> This is what happens when you try to deliver more than nothing
[0:24:58] <%That_Mojo> not badd tbh
[0:25:03] <+vaporousTippler> Stop all the uploadin'!
[0:25:03] <+MrProw> Turn down camera quality perhaps?
[0:25:07] <+tierst> i think it might be some sort of ghost or curse
[0:25:13] <+Carquar> just needs to be refuckulated
[0:25:14] <+Javaa01> Look at the clockspeed via taskmanager as well, just to see if it's getting throttled or whatever
[0:25:17] <$burgersama_dlx> @vaporousTippler help computer
[0:25:22] <%That_Mojo> try 3500? idk
[0:25:42] <CrimsonCore90> Burn it down!!!!
[0:25:42] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:25:47] <%That_Mojo> ah gotcha
[0:25:53] <psidefx> drop to 720 for the new camera is te rate doesn't hlep?
[0:25:55] <@Squdnate> NotLIkeThis
[0:26:01] <@Squdnate> NotLikeThis
[0:26:07] <NeroInfinite> oh no
[0:26:15] <Sedrelic> i dont think thats how it works....
[0:26:23] <$burgersama_dlx> have you tried shouting at it?
[0:26:24] <%CJett92> F
