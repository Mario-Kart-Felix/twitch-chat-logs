[0:00:29] <The_Nerd_Supreme> yep
[0:00:34] <snakemuho> Crunchy boy jumps in
[0:00:36] <penitentpentwitch> It's also from the game, so we can't really tell until you do something in game
[0:00:37] <+oda_flobunaga> no more cinnamon toast
[0:00:39] <%alrobot2014> It happened right as your lightsaber turned off
[0:00:43] <+cubbywolf> it looked like it happened with a frame drop?
[0:00:46] <Visorak6> It can happen literally mid cutscene like it did during the council @WoolieVersus
[0:01:02] <coreyyotto> Buffer issue?
[0:01:02] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:01:10] <%DemonOfSalt> Hungryboi is using Force Vampirism to eat the audio to stop the LP.
[0:01:17] <DatAsuna> I mean it's never happened with doom .etc
[0:01:18] <@Solidus_113> It's happened on some GIFG episodes too
[0:01:21] <+oda_flobunaga> Buffer, I don't even know her
[0:01:23] <+AnthraxJohnson> We back!
[0:01:25] <+cubbywolf> !shedule
[0:01:28] <+cubbywolf> woops
[0:01:33] <+cubbywolf> im just gonna go
[0:01:39] <lotharrio> The jumps are driver based. I got those on my most recent playthroughs. Only fixed it when I changed the ini to allow windowed mode.
[0:01:39] <knotsundownsyndrome> !schedule
[0:01:39] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1270228062764969985
[0:01:45] <redmoon108> 👀
[0:01:46] <time_axis> I think it's an OBS thing
[0:01:52] <DatAsuna> i would guess maybe it's something to do with how the game handles fullscreen .etc @WoolieVersus
[0:02:08] <+oda_flobunaga> @cubbywolf no more echos for you
[0:02:18] <%Struggleful> Maybe the streams haunted
[0:02:24] <DatAsuna> fullscreen mode is the source of many bugs
[0:02:44] <+cubbywolf> that door

[0:03:59] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus he uses guns, dexterity is good for his aim
[0:04:00] <%alrobot2014> nope
[0:04:02] <snakemuho> first one
[0:04:06] <lotharrio> I've never seen that, no.
[0:04:06] <%DemonOfSalt> ...maybe? I don't remember if I did.
[0:04:07] <+oda_flobunaga> for make benefit glorious space nation of Mandostan
[0:04:07] <+cubbywolf> never seen a door get murdered
[0:04:08] <dereks0n> Like in real life or
[0:04:09] <coreyyotto> Similar mechanics to the train guy from Fallout?
[0:04:10] <+VCRUZZO> thats a first
[0:04:13] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> I don't think i've ever had this happen
[0:04:14] <phatmac16> never seen that
[0:04:14] <+mczarklesby> One door always screams and the other door always says "betrayal."
[0:04:18] <penitentpentwitch> Woolie's Force Bug Find Powers is growing stronger
[0:04:19] <The_Nerd_Supreme> nah I haven't
[0:04:19] <Heyestus> It used to happen on the xbox version of kotor2 as well
[0:04:20] <+jiggy_snipe> 320 crit
[0:04:20] <+krispen_wa> Woolie's QA curse strikes again
[0:04:25] <%alrobot2014> its like when you made a box bleed in black mesa
[0:04:26] <%jillpilled> Screaming doors somehow approriate for Nihlus' ship though
[0:04:28] <coreyyotto> Hitboxes are people too.
[0:04:28] <tolloponik> wollie doing his job even when not getting paid to
[0:04:29] <DatAsuna> other side of that rubble
[0:04:31] <phatmac16> Woolie is cursed
[0:04:32] <%jillpilled> *seems
[0:04:35] <+jiggy_snipe> just alot cool things
[0:04:40] <+cubbywolf> I think this game is also like that
[0:04:41] <snakemuho> Every Kotor2 copy is personalized
[0:04:45] <penitentpentwitch> What is Woolie's QA Stand Name?
[0:04:53] <+jiggy_snipe> bring me to life is too strong
[0:04:53] <%yeildingthought> Part of the ship, part of the crew... WutFace
[0:04:57] <+cubbywolf> lol
[0:04:57] <coreyyotto> The Sheer Heart Attack to Woolie's Bring Me To Life
[0:04:59] <+CelebrityGhost> does he FIND bugs or CAUSE bugs?
[0:05:03] <+cubbywolf> pathfinding
[0:05:03] <DatAsuna> also just saying, there's a console command called turbo if you wanna just run faster
[0:05:03] <$GabeSweetMan> But he already has [Bring me to Life}
[0:05:03] <%jillpilled> New Vegas and KOTOR 2 have so many bugs that pop up each new playthrough
[0:05:05] <+krispen_wa> ANY GUNS?
[0:05:09] <+jiggy_snipe> cell D:
[0:05:11] <lotharrio> Woolie loves bugs. "Bring me to Life" alters reality to make things Woolie likes.
[0:05:16] <+Reverend_Roscoe> 2
[0:05:18] <%Struggleful> Garbage attracts bugs
[0:05:20] <+oda_flobunaga> would Woolie's stand be Hall Wugg
[0:05:23] <+cubbywolf> LUL
[0:05:23] <DatAsuna> Do it
[0:05:24] <+oda_flobunaga> ?
[0:05:39] <+cubbywolf> @Struggleful damn son
[0:05:40] <%alrobot2014> we're only planting bombs in here no big
[0:05:44] <%gatorafan> That means sex, right?

[0:06:00] <eliudfs1> I think
[0:06:01] <dinnydanny777> Oh a prison cell would have bad echoes huh
[0:06:12] <$GabeSweetMan> Rub your eyeball on the stone surface
[0:06:14] <DatAsuna> Thanks jedi voice 3
[0:06:16] <dinnydanny777> All the force echoes of people locked inside of a prison?
[0:06:17] <+cubbywolf> spooky
[0:06:21] <$GabeSweetMan> Asmrrrrrr
[0:06:25] <+Freeborg1997> It's blue if you're light side, red if you're dark side
[0:06:26] <DatAsuna> Rise up rey
[0:06:29] <snakemuho> she watching her favorite ASMR on warsTube
[0:06:29] <$GabeSweetMan> Force ASMR
[0:06:29] <$GoogleyGareth> What bothers me is her sabers don't react to the lighting in the room
[0:06:38] <+krispen_wa> CHARACTER ARRRK
[0:06:41] <%ShadowArcangel> you can actually hear the whispers and the change between dark/light side
[0:06:52] <%ShadowArcangel> "its gonna be okay" can be heard among other things
[0:06:52] <%jillpilled> DEVELOPMENT
[0:06:57] <dinnydanny777> Aren't we at the end of the game...?
[0:07:03] <DatAsuna> also the bomb side is backwards
[0:07:09] <penitentpentwitch> Now loot her room!
[0:07:10] <+oda_flobunaga> Champions of Teris Kassai is the best Star Wars game ever made Kappa, blows this thing out of the water
[0:07:11] <$GabeSweetMan> Fair. She got the RAWEST deal.
[0:07:16] <gade177> @dinnydanny777 Pretty close.
[0:07:18] <+Estuko> "We're all gonna make it brah..."
[0:07:19] <lotharrio> Becoming slave to your parents' murderer is pretty bad.
[0:07:23] <+Reverend_Roscoe> NOT ANYMORE
[0:07:27] <DatAsuna> in canon? they don't exist in canon
[0:07:29] <+cubbywolf> that one door was alive
[0:07:33] <+wunp_fxs> One Game
[0:07:33] <+cubbywolf> only the one
[0:07:36] <dinnydanny777> So we get a boost to force points when we're almost at the end of the game huh
[0:07:37] <+krispen_wa> This was the game tha introduced Miraluka
[0:07:37] <lotharrio> They are pretty EU so like...
[0:07:38] <+cubbywolf> now its never alive
[0:07:44] <%GrassCannon> it is
[0:07:44] <DatAsuna> yes
[0:07:46] <+Reaviar> its
[0:07:47] <+Allyofwar> villian in dark forces 2
[0:07:50] <DatAsuna> Sage is the prestige class
[0:07:51] <Shade075> Jarek form dark forces 2
[0:07:52] <knotsundownsyndrome> it is consular and knight
[0:07:55] <%CyanDeadEye> Jedi Knight and Consular
[0:07:59] <dinnydanny777> Dark Forces 2 is Jedi Knight right
[0:07:59] <+oda_flobunaga> yes it is
[0:08:01] <+krispen_wa> Oh yeah i forgot jarek
[0:08:02] <Doodle_Taco> Wait HOW can you pick it in SWTOR??
[0:08:03] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:08:04] <DatAsuna> yeah kyle katarn fought them
[0:08:11] <%CyanDeadEye> Jerek was a retcon wasn't it?
[0:08:14] <+wunp_fxs> Nope Dark forces 2
[0:08:22] <+oda_flobunaga> @dinnydanny777 yes
[0:08:47] <+SolidusRex> The Selkath (AKA the fish people on Manaan) were also made by Bioware
[0:08:52] <DatAsuna> @GrassCannon and nah the 90s comics invented miraluka
[0:08:57] <%CyanDeadEye> Jerek when the game first came out was a human, but after the Miraluka became an actual race they retconned him into one.
[0:08:59] <+ntfth> @WoolieVersus One of the video games had an Inquisitor Miraluka serving Palpatine.
[0:09:06] <+cubbywolf> she best grill?
[0:09:08] <penitentpentwitch> I sort of wish this Dungeon looked like several ships mashed together
[0:09:11] <dinnydanny777> What were the Argonian looking race called
[0:09:11] <CursedNobleman> @SolidusRex oh, like Sekolah from BGII
[0:09:19] <DatAsuna> Kotor borrows almost all it's shit from the comics
[0:09:19] <time_axis> There's Mira. Kappa
[0:09:20] <lotharrio> Well you can foster harem catfights with some choices.
[0:09:29] <+cubbywolf> Mira ftw
[0:09:34] <JetpackMcQuack> Math checks out
[0:09:48] <+jiggy_snipe> Mira doesn't want to compete so no harem
[0:09:52] <KiddKame> @cubbywolf No
[0:09:54] <DatAsuna> also this room is nonsense
[0:09:57] <petwisk> Darth Math Attcks again
[0:10:00] <%DSD24> Visas is best choice anyway
[0:10:01] <%mostly_simple> the still photo of Fanny when he confronts the Jedi masters would make a good emote for a time like this
[0:10:02] <DatAsuna> what is it even loading them into?
[0:10:21] <+cubbywolf> man i remember crashing on this level all the time

[0:15:55] <time_axis> they're future corpse (nothing)s
[0:16:01] <dinnydanny777> They should just say "Replica" across the side
[0:16:02] <%DSD24> They are just XP
[0:16:03] <%BisoromiBear> meat lootboxes
[0:16:08] <dinnydanny777> "From the gift shop"

[0:17:56] <tolloponik> its starting to smell

[0:19:13] <+oda_flobunaga> no windows
[0:19:28] <snakemuho> It always seemed without windows to me
[0:19:29] <+cubbywolf> in game i bet they dont have window panels ther
[0:19:29] <shutupandjam3465> those people are aware of whats happening in my opinion
[0:19:30] <+krispen_wa> I just realized Darth Jadus in SWTOR basically does the same thing to his crew
[0:19:32] <+Estuko> @WoolieVersus Would Killing(?) him just cause everything in this whole shit to fall apart and die
[0:19:40] <kazadaz> Using the force to hold the O2 molecules in place
[0:19:40] <DatAsuna> but also he had to specifcally remodel the republic ship to look this evil
[0:19:41] <dinnydanny777> How can Fann breathe if there's no windows
[0:19:42] <ZeeJiggle> God his design is so rad.

[0:35:04] <dinnydanny777> ATRIS DID NOTHING WRONG

[0:35:13] <lotharrio> They were right, but handled it wrong.
[0:35:15] <+oda_flobunaga> Reven knew
[0:35:22] <KiddKame> Apathy WAS Light Later
[0:35:24] <dinnydanny777> Revan would be laughing at you right now
[0:35:25] <%christopherwpoindexter> they just didn't know WHAT to be skeptical of
[0:35:25] <%DSD24> Yeah but that still meant more people to die
[0:35:25] <%Reizie_Etherealm> SHE KNEW??
[0:35:26] <Joestar1890> The right choice was to wait, the moral choice is to save the galaxy
[0:35:26] <%redrins> but she won
[0:35:26] <phatmac16> #VROOKWASSUPERRIGHT
[0:35:27] <gerakiv> BOOMER VROOK WAS RIGHT
[0:35:27] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Yeah, the question at that point is, who do you want to be left? Mandos or Republic?
[0:35:28] <%jillpilled> Vrook was right without even realizing it 😡😡😡😡
[0:35:28] <eliudfs1> They were right to be skeptical, but that dosen't make them right in their desicion.
[0:35:31] <CoronaVirusIsOver> female revan cmonBruh
[0:35:31] <boostergoldz> it also means Revan knew the whole time and was playing 4d chess
[0:35:32] <lotharrio> She figured it out.
[0:35:32] <Dova573> She called it a LAUGH TALE
[0:35:32] <+BubbaRands> SOMEBODY'S GETTIN FUCK
[0:35:33] <%Camail> yea but she won
[0:35:33] <Heyestus> Hatin' on the guy who was right all along LUL
[0:35:35] <Dova573> Kappa\
[0:35:37] <Dova573> Kappa
[0:35:38] <GarbageNirvana> It feels like Revan was doing shit for the lulz
[0:35:38] <Visorak6> How was she going to convince everyone?
[0:35:38] <dinnydanny777> Right now Revan would be laughing at you
[0:35:39] <+BubbaRands> GET FUCKED
[0:35:41] <Lee_The_Limey> You got played
[0:35:41] <+eanscrale> The Jedi were light later ALL ALONG!
[0:35:46] <fuji_92> SHE KNEW WOOLIE
[0:35:47] <%Reizie_Etherealm> That was one our most unfinished black sequel!!
[0:35:49] <%JohnAtDawn> @Dova573 Fucking knew someone else would think of that
[0:35:55] <+Feralspirit41> How Revan handles telling canderous this is different if you say Revan was light side im pretty sure
[0:35:56] <tuesti> Then Revan learned
[0:35:58] <austinj24> Revan saw some shit out there
[0:35:59] <%mostly_simple> VROOK LAUGHS FROM BEYOND THE GRAVE
[0:36:00] <DatAsuna> They were sith before that
[0:36:03] <+jiggy_snipe> actuall
[0:36:07] <%ShadowArcangel> that line is because of dark side Revan, Light side Revan is more reasonable. Says to Canderous to revive the clans, here's the helmet, we are going to reaaally need them soon
[0:36:07] <Firststrike_OW> Pockets was evil
[0:36:08] <gerakiv> REVAN LAUGHED
[0:36:10] <dinnydanny777> Is this about the pain loving weirdos from the Outer Rim?
[0:36:10] <+jiggy_snipe> EVERYONE WAS RIGHT
[0:36:13] <gerakiv> SHE CHUCKLED
[0:36:13] <DatAsuna> They fell DURING the war
[0:36:19] <available_line> or according to Kreia, Revan did a light later
[0:36:19] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1270228062764969985
[0:36:20] <time_axis> so people who say SWTOR ignores this game are just completely wrong
[0:36:23] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @fuji_92
[0:36:24] <Monkeyweed21> @mostly_simple he doesn't get to cuz Kreia cut him off
[0:36:26] <+ntfth> @dinnydanny777 No, SWTOR
[0:36:27] <Lee_The_Limey> It's the Philosophers Kappa
[0:36:31] <%Ashenik1> Now we are just dealing with the left overs of the Manadlorian Wars which happened to be a BLACK HOLE
[0:36:33] <+AnthraxJohnson> Revan default dancing on Canderous
[0:36:34] <lotharrio> And build the HK army.
[0:36:44] <gerakiv> REVEN CACKLED, LAUGHING AT VROOK
[0:36:44] <+SinisterBroccoli> V, have you read or know the details of the Revan novel?
[0:36:50] <dinnydanny777> Revan 360 noscoped Canderous and teabagged him
[0:36:52] <+krispen_wa> @time_axis it doesn't ignore this game, it just ignores everything good about the Exile, and kreia, and everything else good except the sequel hook
[0:36:54] <blackskulldragon18> She was preparing for the outer world
[0:36:54] <CoronaVirusIsOver> fuck the revan novel
[0:36:56] <dereks0n> Revan was fighting 3 WARS AT ONCE
[0:37:02] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus also this reveal is restored content lol
[0:37:04] <brachydios777> The True Sith
[0:37:07] <+Estuko> I had fun with SWTOR, Imperial Sniper if I recall... or Agent? I can't recall been years..
[0:37:08] <%mostly_simple> @monkeyweed21 oh yeah
[0:37:11] <%christopherwpoindexter> not yet
[0:37:12] <Heyestus> it bad
[0:37:20] <fuji_92> LUL
[0:37:20] <BurdRightsActivist> Don't tell me what to do :)
[0:37:20] <+Zouledge> @AvoidingTheCoronaVirus this doodbro doodStare
[0:37:21] <Pappajimbo> I was holding them back!!!
[0:37:22] <+krispen_wa> Imperial Agent is amazing, yes
[0:37:25] <+theaceclaw> Imperial Agent is badass in swtor
[0:37:26] <+oda_flobunaga> then don't ask us to DRINK
[0:37:27] <GHouseduivel> I will not chill :)
[0:37:27] <+VCRUZZO> please chill
[0:37:31] <SuperChumps> @WoolieVersus gonna play SWTOR?
[0:37:34] <+VCRUZZO> damn it
[0:37:34] <DatAsuna> Also they have that doc I wrote
[0:37:34] <Joestar1890> Smuggler is best class, not because of the story because they're a sassy mf
[0:37:40] <KnivesEve> the universe will never chill
[0:37:41] <%christopherwpoindexter> one at a time
[0:37:43] <+theaceclaw> theres a lot of cool things in swtor but bringing back revan was a bad idea
[0:37:45] <gerakiv> Imperial Agent and Sith Warrior were great
[0:37:47] <Djinnazz> @SuperChumps God no
[0:37:49] <gerakiv> best parts of the game
[0:37:54] <Feathy> smuggler was so much fun
[0:37:54] <dinnydanny777> Well if you buy the MMO you might find out...
[0:37:54] <%Ashenik1> Its a good read the Revan book Woolie check it out it was written buy the guy who had wrote KOTOR 1
[0:37:54] <gerakiv> LS Sith*
[0:37:55] <+jiggy_snipe> I imagine he learned in the Mando Wars
[0:37:55] <CoronaVirusIsOver> the revan novel and TOR ruin revan and the exile and kreia too
[0:37:57] <+krispen_wa> I will never chill as long as the Exile remains dicked over by Drew
[0:37:58] <%CommanderSqueaks> -ANGRY SITH HOLOCRON NOISES-
[0:37:59] <+theaceclaw> inquisitor is lots of fun too
[0:38:06] <+Estuko> I had a lot of fun with the story and the oufits I could wear as one lol.
[0:38:07] <@Moobot> Please don't fill up the entire chat, @TheFabledAble
[0:38:09] <grandark_z317> fucking shitty ass Picard ads
[0:38:10] <brachydios777> @dinnydanny777 Isn’t it free?
[0:38:15] <+theaceclaw> TOR doesn't even mention Kreia
[0:38:19] <+VCRUZZO> no
[0:38:23] <fuji_92> no
[0:38:27] <+goedmonton> Revan novel sucks
[0:38:27] <lotharrio> Mandos didn't join Revan.
[0:38:32] <DatAsuna> Drew was only interested in revan yeah
[0:38:34] <talkaboutwhat> Revan novel straight up disrespects KOTOR 2
[0:38:43] <dinnydanny777> @brachydios777 Is it? I was just making a joke lol
[0:38:44] <Monkeyweed21> Reva was trying to take over the Republic to militarize and get ready for the outside invaders
[0:38:48] <+MrMoonGoose> @goedmonton your novel sucks! /s
[0:38:51] <Lee_The_Limey> Mando's get shafted , man
[0:38:59] <+jiggy_snipe> taking control
[0:39:03] <+jiggy_snipe> for a greater war
[0:39:04] <%Ashenik1> Revan went: Democracy is cool but right now it aint efficient enough to fight the SITH so lets go facism to fight the shit to come
[0:39:06] <lotharrio> Mandos got scattered and broken. It's only after the Jedi civil war that Revan is like, "Yo Cando. Rebuild the Mandolorians. I ORDER YOU!"
[0:39:06] <%mostly_simple> mandos always get played
[0:39:13] <dinnydanny777> Revan kind of treated Canderous like a bitch
[0:39:17] <+VCRUZZO> @talkaboutwhat unfortunately , you ain't wrong
[0:39:20] <Heyestus> revan was trying to break the spirit of her opponents, not their facilities
[0:39:30] <DatAsuna> @lotharrio i used the facism to destroy the facism
[0:39:31] <%redrins> no
[0:39:31] <+VCRUZZO> no
[0:39:32] <+jiggy_snipe> probably not
[0:39:34] <%CommanderSqueaks> no
[0:39:35] <+krispen_wa> Jedi Council hesitating still would have fucked them over
[0:39:35] <fuji_92> no
[0:39:49] <Monkeyweed21> Revan was trying to take over the Republic to get ready for the next war
[0:40:00] <+krispen_wa> Yes
[0:40:02] <+MidnightBurst12> She intended to rule the republic and use what was left using their resources
[0:40:06] <+krispen_wa> that is correct
[0:40:09] <%Ashenik1> IDK maybe if mandalorians had won they could have been strong enough and ally with Jedi to fight the SITH
[0:40:09] <$TheFabledAble> @WoolieVersus Revan likely intended to take over the republic as a dictator to ensure she could consolidate all the resources of the galaxy against the unknown region threat.
[0:40:11] <ShiningAxis> If they didn't fight, Revan would never have gone to the Outer Rim and no one would know what was coming until it was too late
[0:40:12] <gerakiv> Her war against the republic was to harden them
[0:40:20] <Pappajimbo> turning the hand of the republic into the fist of an empire
[0:40:21] <RantingRavager> CONQUER TO UNIFY
[0:40:21] <%therabbles> Lohengramm
[0:40:22] <Heyestus> literally LIGHT LATER
[0:40:23] <fuji_92> yes, light later literally kinda
[0:40:23] <+krispen_wa> No, she protected the vital parts of the republic
[0:40:24] <$GabeSweetMan> LIGHT LATER
[0:40:25] <+jiggy_snipe> Revan learned about during the mando war not before but there was a reason for the civil war
[0:40:26] <dinnydanny777> Could there actually be anything worse than Nihilus
[0:40:28] <lotharrio> Better a weaker, solidified whole, than multiple fractured, stronger factions.
[0:40:30] <%redrins> seize the means of production and prep for an upcoming war
[0:40:31] <%vaderxyz1970> The GOTO method
[0:40:31] <+krispen_wa> she kept the infrastructure alive
[0:40:32] <+northsouthmiddledakota> She did the Shiv in the old expanded universe
[0:40:33] <+jiggy_snipe> big PREPS
[0:40:39] <+oda_flobunaga> incoming Tyrannids
[0:40:43] <tuesti> yeah not necessarily weakening it, she took out key figures to take over their worlds
[0:40:43] <Divryne> LIGHTEST LATER.
[0:40:47] <+MidnightBurst12> Tried to speedrun a Palpatine
[0:40:49] <dinnydanny777> I mean, the Republic lost that war
[0:40:49] <%mostly_simple> Revan light later?
[0:40:51] <%Reizie_Etherealm> What if renegade shepard took over the galaxy
[0:40:51] <DatAsuna> This is why I said to see the disciple stuff before the ending lol
[0:40:55] <+goedmonton> @mrmoongoose My novel is the best
[0:40:55] <+krispen_wa> Malak fucked over everything by blowing shit up, but Revan was smart
[0:40:59] <%CommanderSqueaks> REVAN Light Later
[0:41:03] <shutupandjam3465> its a gainax gambit
[0:41:03] <Visorak6> Its cutting all the red tape down trying to convince the leaders of the republic
[0:41:13] <dereks0n> Fable 3 vibes
[0:41:13] <+jiggy_snipe> the republic was ass, she needed to take control for a bigger war
[0:41:14] <+northsouthmiddledakota> take control and arm them against the Yuzhan Vong
[0:41:19] <fuji_92> kill the republic for light later against the unseen enemies
[0:41:21] <+northsouthmiddledakota> is the same shit
[0:41:23] <dinnydanny777> Morally and technically the Republic totally lost that war, they lost the actual war and they lost all public support because of all their mass murder
[0:41:30] <+SouLucha> Do you think there was another path for Revan to try?
[0:41:40] <+SouLucha> Something less destructive?
[0:41:41] <Joestar1890> Also Malak wanted to tear shit up
[0:41:49] <Lee_The_Limey> Rejected Kappa
[0:41:52] <%Ashenik1> mandalorians were the mongols, revan was like the Roman Empire
[0:41:55] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[0:41:57] <+krispen_wa> The less destructive path was killing Malak before he could betray her
[0:42:07] <blackskulldragon18> wow
[0:42:09] <lotharrio> "This left leg? Used to be organic."
[0:42:09] <%DappercatEsquire> Revan stepped on my balls :(((
[0:42:09] <$TheFabledAble> Revan was attempting a "War of conversion" which is why she prioritized converting jedi, and republic soldiers rather than just outright killing them.
[0:42:15] <+krispen_wa> and not building her sith upon backstabbing
[0:42:20] <ZeeJiggle> Yea? You equal with the Exile?
[0:42:29] <dinnydanny777> Well maybe beating you filled her pockets in some way
[0:42:32] <boostergoldz> pockets? erratic?
[0:42:32] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> How did that go the first time?
[0:42:33] <Lee_The_Limey> You was too clingy bro
[0:42:35] <boostergoldz> nah
[0:42:35] <$SpecterHDMC> Cheer500 hey guys i know this is weird but think about this nihilus and aldrich from dark souls as one being give that a thought
[0:42:36] <Lefteron> @WoolieVersus The cannon is that Revan was lightside male, just saying
[0:42:39] <+SouLucha> Yes, that was another unseen hinderance, but if Revan hadn't turn all "conquering sith" would things have turned out different?
[0:42:42] <DatAsuna> he's prepping to fight revan
[0:42:44] <+jiggy_snipe> maybe she beat you to make you stronger I guess
[0:42:54] <Afrobrawler> kinda like the light side for that more
[0:43:02] <tuesti> is that what he always says or was Pockets considered sith?
[0:43:05] <+Exicuren> Canderous was weak for having nothing to lose
[0:43:09] <Djinnazz> damnit
[0:43:13] <snakemuho> @SpecterHDMC they both had a bunch of content cut, yeah
[0:43:14] <tolloponik> she kicked him so he wouldn't follow
[0:43:15] <%Graxe_> "When Pockets comes back, I got all my boys to back me up."
[0:43:21] <+SouLucha> I mean Sith before the Pockets arc.
[0:43:21] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:43:22] <Lee_The_Limey> LUL
[0:43:22] <%Ashenik1> @Lefteron another white guy
[0:43:24] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> I don't remember the details, but if Revan was Lightside Cando's dialogue here changes bit.
[0:43:25] <$TheFabledAble> @WoolieVersus if your Revan was light side, instead of laughing at mandalores face, she pleads with Canderous to rebuild the mandalorians as they will be needed for the coming conflict
[0:43:27] <$GabeSweetMan> Well then go to the bathroom.
[0:43:28] <$StaceMcGate> RUNNING THROUGH MY HEAD
[0:43:32] <DatAsuna> just filter to quest
[0:43:33] <penitentpentwitch> Brain constipated, too much inside
[0:43:36] <+Exicuren> So Revan gave him an objetive so he could have something to protrct
[0:43:37] <giga_bit> ANSWERS will be ANSWERED
[0:43:39] <+SouLucha> Before Revan got mindwiped... Another thing that made matters worse.
[0:43:42] <+Feralspirit41> I wish I couldve seen that but I had to miss it because a fucking ad was playing
[0:43:46] <+jiggy_snipe> Revan was also a big fan of light later
[0:43:48] <dinnydanny777> He's gone
[0:43:51] <hattrick61> So was Reven preparing for the reapers? Starwars DOES take place a long long time ago.
[0:43:56] <%christopherwpoindexter> @ashenik1 literally tho
[0:43:58] <dinnydanny777> Fann should've looked
[0:44:05] <Monkeyweed21> He just dissolved into red lightning Woolie
[0:44:09] <arkv01> we attacked and dethroned an old one
[0:44:12] <+krispen_wa> Revan was basically Shepard if Shepard took over the galaxy to prepare for the REapers
[0:44:15] <DatAsuna> this is why you have filter options
[0:44:34] <dinnydanny777> We didn't really see him die when you think about it
[0:44:40] <a_mad_dragon> WHO MADE THE MASK
[0:44:41] <%christopherwpoindexter> all this stuff we'll never use 🙃
[0:44:48] <+Exicuren> Revan is ME 1 Renegade Shepard
[0:44:52] <+krispen_wa> Nobody cared about him until he put on the mask
[0:44:57] <ZeeJiggle> Good, we needed that force buff, we were getting a bit low.
[0:45:02] <lotharrio> Force Lich
[0:45:03] <dinnydanny777> Now you can cosplay as the creature from Spirited Away
[0:45:03] <+oda_flobunaga> Bao-Who?
[0:45:09] <%HostilePoundcakes> hmmmmmmmm?
[0:45:13] <GHouseduivel> You should ship that mask to the closest sun
[0:45:16] <wowowinsane> carth was always a shell of a man
[0:45:19] <%HostilePoundcakes> huh
[0:45:20] <DatAsuna> also a carth scene happens here
[0:45:20] <dinnydanny777> The mask was him
[0:45:23] <Monkeyweed21> he just dissolved into red lightning
[0:45:24] <dinnydanny777> He is the mask
[0:45:25] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Yup, living void
[0:45:28] <dinnydanny777> He's a mask
[0:45:30] <ZeeJiggle> Pocket Nihilus
[0:45:30] <tolloponik> in all honestly giving him a face would make him immediately less cool
[0:45:32] <+jiggy_snipe> look at he died
[0:45:35] <dinnydanny777> He is a Majora's Mask
[0:45:35] <tranquilturnip> I always thought he was a ghost in there
[0:45:36] <Heyestus> Did you ever notice how Nihilus and Bao-Dur never appeared in the same scene?
[0:45:38] <+SouLucha> So he Dr. Manhatten it?
[0:45:43] <%redrins> he is a force being
[0:45:48] <+Exicuren> He was Majora
[0:45:53] <tranquilturnip> Force Wraith
[0:45:53] <+krispen_wa> He was metaphorically a man to Visas
[0:45:53] <dinnydanny777> If you look at his body he looks like a shadow
[0:45:55] <penitentpentwitch> Floating head in armor
[0:45:59] <+BubbaRands> Force ghost
[0:46:01] <available_line> Symbolic.
[0:46:02] <Zombrocom> Visas cant see
[0:46:06] <prime_name> Woolie overthink?
[0:46:06] <+ntfth> Reminder, Visas doesn't have eyes.
[0:46:06] <+SouLucha> Alphonse?!
[0:46:07] <fuji_92> it was a metaphor wools
[0:46:08] <tattleworm> @WoolieVersus visas' line is different if you're dark side, she sees a void instead
[0:46:08] <lotharrio> A mask wearing a skeleton
[0:46:08] <gundamech> Visas see's through the force
[0:46:11] <Parapattern> She blind
[0:46:11] <%GrassCannon> Ask the blind girl how he looks LUL
[0:46:12] <Visorak6> His influence is gone he's not immortal aka just a man woolie
[0:46:13] <Lefteron> She blind
[0:46:13] <shutupandjam3465> visas cant see
[0:46:13] <%Graxe_> Also, yeah, she can't actually see
[0:46:13] <+DukeBlack_> Visa is blind
[0:46:15] <DatAsuna> kotor 2 has continuity errors with itself
[0:46:15] <ZeeJiggle> I always saw that as more his body was manifested just so there was 'some' form there.
[0:46:16] <+jiggy_snipe> Visas can't see but sees through the force
[0:46:18] <Lee_The_Limey> SSSSSMOKIN'
[0:46:18] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> like a nazgul kinda
[0:46:19] <$StaceMcGate> SHES BLIND WOOLIE
[0:46:19] <GHouseduivel> Visas doesn't have sight with her eyes Woolie
[0:46:21] <+Gohyakuen> She's blind Woolie
[0:46:21] <%Graxe_> Only through the Force
[0:46:22] <%ShadowArcangel> Visas see through the Force too, shot in the dark maybe she saw the man that was
[0:46:22] <Monkeyweed21> its symbolic that he's no longer a god she cant touch
[0:46:22] <fuji_92> besides she's blind
[0:46:23] <Heyestus> that or he's like a shriveled up mummy man or whatever
[0:46:24] <+Tadashi047> visas is blind woolie
[0:46:24] <+oda_flobunaga> Its almost like this game is poorly written Kappa
[0:46:26] <%kulmoth> its just a metaphor don't think too hard about it
[0:46:27] <phatmac16> she's blind
[0:46:27] <BurdRightsActivist> Nobody cared who I was until I put on the Mask
[0:46:27] <+northsouthmiddledakota> simbolism is hard for wollie huh?
[0:46:28] <DatAsuna> Don't question it too much woolie
[0:46:28] <+SolidusRex> Toph is blind
[0:46:29] <%Ashenik1> the body was just a body he was a mask
[0:46:31] <%GrassCannon> Woolie, didn't you just watch Avatar?
[0:46:33] <dinnydanny777> When it says "on Malachor V" was he literally on the planet?
[0:46:33] <+kewlmyc> FULLMETAL ALCHEMIST
[0:46:36] <+OldDarkwraith> He was a robe, mask and with evil cloud inside?
[0:46:37] <snakemuho> Kappa
[0:46:40] <lotharrio> @WoolieVersus He was a mask, wearing a body.
[0:46:42] <penitentpentwitch> Wait, did Visas just prank the Exile when he asked her 'what did you see?'
[0:46:42] <brachydios777> He’s a nazgul
[0:46:45] <giga_bit> He Alphonsed that shit
[0:46:48] <%mostly_simple> floating mask like from Mario 2 lmao
[0:46:52] <%HostilePoundcakes> oh yeah i forgot she's blind LUL
[0:46:58] <petwisk> Woolie is carrying the Corpse of Nihilus in that mask
[0:47:03] <dinnydanny777> When the other characters talk about Malachor V it seems like they were outside it while Nihilus was actually on it when whatever happened to it happened
[0:47:05] <Nedzach> He was Anubis from Stargate
[0:47:06] <Lefteron> ARE YOU A GOD?
[0:47:08] <DatAsuna> corpse nothing indeed
[0:47:08] <+DukeBlack_> nooooooooo
[0:47:09] <+krispen_wa> Perfect spot to end
[0:47:10] <Lefteron> THEN DIE!
[0:47:13] <+BingsAksolum> Literal corpse nothing
[0:47:13] <RantingRavager> NO KEEP ON GOING
[0:47:13] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[0:47:14] <DatAsuna> Mask nothing
[0:47:15] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> waaaaaaahhhhh
[0:47:17] <GHouseduivel> Frick bed times
[0:47:17] <Augus7717> BibleThump
[0:47:18] <%jillpilled> V needs to nappy uwu
[0:47:18] <+wunp_fxs> awwwwww
[0:47:21] <Monkeyweed21> he's a force black hole to the point it consumed his flesh
[0:47:23] <%christopherwpoindexter> 🙁
[0:47:24] <lotharrio> Finale next time.
[0:47:24] <$StaceMcGate> another 4 hours to go most likely
[0:47:24] <+Exicuren> This really the best moment
[0:47:25] <ZeeJiggle> Next week y'all
[0:47:25] <prince_johnny_> awwww
[0:47:29] <%kulmoth> 😔
[0:47:30] <shutupandjam3465> AHHHHHH OK NEXT TIME
[0:47:31] <%ShadowArcangel> Next session should be the last yeah?
[0:47:32] <Joestar1890> So close to the end!
[0:47:34] <Lefteron> Goodnight
[0:47:34] <tolloponik> @WoolieVersus in literature when a big evil is defeated, taking them off their pedestal and only evaluating them as nothing more than a person is the strongest thing you can do to them
[0:47:36] <%christopherwpoindexter> I mean the endgame is friggin long anyhow
[0:47:37] <Monkeyweed21> is he a king of the liches?
[0:47:37] <ZeeJiggle> Super close!
[0:47:38] <%jillpilled> WE'RE SO CLOOOOSE
[0:47:39] <dinnydanny777> What happens if you wear the mask
[0:47:39] <available_line> eldlich
[0:47:40] <ZeeJiggle> Hehehe. Doody.
[0:47:42] <+krispen_wa> Next session is DEFINITELY the last
[0:47:42] <+oda_flobunaga> Hows it Feeeeeeeeeeeeel to be a Litch
[0:47:44] <%Chatterbox1991> HE IS A MORMON
[0:47:45] <Monkeyweed21> it used to be a dude
[0:47:49] <%christopherwpoindexter> we kinda need a break in the action
[0:47:51] <%CommanderSqueaks> nihilus is a B I T C H
[0:47:54] <DatAsuna> next session is also gonna be the buggiest
[0:47:56] <Monkeyweed21> It was once a dude
[0:47:57] <blackskulldragon18> Now we have 2 people left Crusty boy and BETRAYAL
[0:48:01] <%christopherwpoindexter> man-turned-monster
[0:48:05] <tattleworm> he was a dude, then he got hungry and eventually he got so hungry he ate himself
[0:48:06] <+oda_flobunaga> she can't see with eyes
[0:48:10] <dinnydanny777> His mask is a Sith artefact
[0:48:16] <+krispen_wa> He's the force in a shape of a dude
[0:48:17] <dinnydanny777> Is his mask a Sith artefact?
[0:48:18] <%DappercatEsquire> got so hungry he sucked his own dick
[0:48:20] <arkv01> vader coulda gone that route huh
[0:48:28] <+krispen_wa> It's Atris's propaganda
[0:48:29] <%GrassCannon> White vs Black
[0:48:31] <%alrobot2014> its artis' dream
[0:48:35] <Halospaz117> Oh Avellone hates any art and stuff that depicts him as a person
[0:48:35] <GHouseduivel> Cause its Light vs Dark, thats it
[0:48:38] <Joestar1890> BETRAYAL
[0:48:38] <%jillpilled> Big warhero Atris LUL
[0:48:41] <Visorak6> Big swerve
[0:48:41] <tolloponik> it's what she imagined herself to bo doing
[0:48:42] <DatAsuna> white vs black
[0:48:42] <%christopherwpoindexter> @krispen_wa YES LITERALLY
[0:48:47] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL Atris big hero dreams
[0:48:48] <snakemuho> Atris Force Hacked steam and put it there
[0:48:49] <dinnydanny777> Remember the Sith artefacts from earlier on? Is that what he is?
[0:48:51] <fuji_92> BIGGEST HEROINE ATRIS
[0:48:52] <DatAsuna> white supremacy atris vs black power nihilus
[0:48:54] <%ShadowArcangel> They were supposed to fight if I'm not mistaken
[0:48:57] <+Freeborg1997> Darth Krayt says "you put your consciousness inside your armor." when he's interviewing Nihlus's sith holocron.
[0:48:57] <Doodle_Taco> I think Chris said that he hated 90% o all the promo art
[0:49:01] <+Exicuren> That is Atris's mental masturbation
[0:49:02] <%redrins> atris is a snack to nihilus, quite literally
[0:49:05] <Heyestus> In early concepts for Kotor2 Atris was meant to kill Kreia on Telos become the final boss
[0:49:07] <Lefteron> She would be added to the vore tag
[0:49:08] <petwisk> Metraa Suri is kind of similar to atris
[0:49:13] <Eskuire> just got home from work, what'd I miss boys?
[0:49:16] <%christopherwpoindexter> damn, when the marketing is intentionally misleading for the plot, not because- @doodle_taco oh wait that was an accident?!
[0:49:18] <ZeeJiggle> He had sick dreads.
[0:49:21] <+krispen_wa> You missed the entire telos endgame
[0:49:31] <petwisk> at least her wookiepedia apearence
[0:49:32] <GHouseduivel> Dead locks LUL
[0:49:33] <Monkeyweed21> He used to be a dude, but his hunger consumed him so entirely he ceased to be flesh and blood he became hunger personified @WoolieVersus
[0:49:35] <dinnydanny777> Was Nihilus a Darth before Malachor V
[0:49:38] <lotharrio> If I learn ANYTHING about Nihilus, then he gets ruined.
[0:49:44] <SixthSun2> The dreadlocks became cthulhu tentacles
[0:49:45] <%jillpilled> I'd love to see concept art of Nihlus pre-fall, who knows how long ago that was
[0:49:46] <+krispen_wa> nihilus was just some dude before malachor
[0:49:50] <fearlesssavant12> what is an eldritch horror
[0:49:53] <%jillpilled> ah
[0:49:54] <%bread_assassin> Is Darh Nihilus "technically" one of the strongest characters in Star Wars. It sounds like he can instantly win against Jedi/Sith that's not the Exile.
[0:49:57] <accidentfish> my headcanon is that atris commissioned that panting for when she fought nihilus
[0:49:58] <Lefteron> @dinnydanny777 I dont think so
[0:50:07] <Doodle_Taco> @christopherwpoindexter I do know he spoke out for Nihilus having a face in the promo art
[0:50:08] <arkv01> something huh
[0:50:10] <DatAsuna> can always just do it like last time and add this to the lp footage
[0:50:13] <+krispen_wa> @bread_assassin basically can insta-kill everything not named Vitiate or Palpatine
[0:50:14] <+MidnightBurst12> nihilus was a jedi at malachor v
[0:50:15] <+oda_flobunaga> Jim-bob Nihilus
[0:50:17] <%christopherwpoindexter> @doodle_taco aw, dang
[0:50:18] <lotharrio> He was a bizarre mutant, like the Exile.
[0:50:18] <Visorak6> Pure miniscule chance
[0:50:18] <+SouLucha> Careful..
[0:50:25] <snakemuho> he was too hungry
[0:50:25] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:50:26] <+theaceclaw> If Malachor V's deaths ruined the force how come Aledraan being blown up doesn't when it had a population of a billion people?
[0:50:30] <%christopherwpoindexter> @accidentfish dam I like that
[0:50:32] <dinnydanny777> I mean, he has a red lightsaber
[0:50:35] <mak0t0yukii> LET'S GO
[0:50:38] <+oda_flobunaga> just like Bao got answers
[0:50:39] <+SouLucha> Thanks V!
[0:50:40] <+Freeborg1997> KEEP PLAYING!
[0:50:40] <snakemuho> it's when you wake up at 5 am and find nothing in the fridge
[0:50:40] <HanhTai> SAVED Pog
[0:50:47] <+akikyou> more awkward gameplay
[0:50:48] <Lee_The_Limey> That's why we keep fightin' right chat?
[0:50:49] <GHouseduivel> @oda_flobunaga y u do dis?
[0:50:50] <%kulmoth> @WoolieVersus Kreiya told you about that this is a technique you have to experience to learn it and he did on malachor
[0:50:58] <fuji_92> Bao got answers that didn't help him
[0:51:01] <%Chatterbox1991> because Alderean ceased to be also wasnt filled with Jedi
[0:51:04] <%Skittlesoul> Skittlesoul subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! hey woolie thanks for all the great content. i was wondering post kotor 2 will you be taking a look at fallen order or any other star wars content?
[0:51:07] <DatAsuna> I already showed you that comic
[0:51:13] <%christopherwpoindexter> @theaceclaw I suppose because nothing physically survived (rock, meatbags, anything)
[0:51:13] <+oda_flobunaga> @GHouseduivel because of the echos
[0:51:15] <%HostilePoundcakes> Ghost planet
[0:51:17] <+Freeborg1997> There is? I read all the comics, and don't remember his origin ever being explained.
[0:51:19] <%HostilePoundcakes> fuck
[0:51:22] <%jillpilled> shit's fucked yo
[0:51:27] <Monkeyweed21> @theaceclaw no living Jedi or force sensitives went to the ruins of Alderaan. Obi Wan was super far away and got gut punched by the deaths
[0:51:28] <penitentpentwitch> Thousands of crashed ships on a planet
[0:51:30] <Lee_The_Limey> Irradiated as heck Kappa
[0:51:31] <Joestar1890> The current state is FUCKED4

[0:51:49] <Lefteron> It has become Septera Core
[0:51:50] <%Chatterbox1991> imagine Passchendaele on Steroids
[0:51:51] <+CatastropheCorvid> !uptime
[0:51:52] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 52 minutes and 2 seconds
[0:51:57] <+MidnightBurst12> The rock called Malachor V still exists

[0:52:03] <ZeeJiggle> Man I can't wait another week dammit haha
[0:52:03] <+thebadpope> woolieDATTEBAYO
[0:52:03] <%bread_assassin> In my mind, it's the equivalent of the planet from the end of the Rise of the Skywalker.
[0:52:04] <%CommanderSqueaks> LUL
[0:52:05] <muniea3> it's the earth in two months
[0:52:14] <%blue2red> planet cracker from dead space

[0:52:19] <%christopherwpoindexter> @muniea3 💀
[0:52:24] <+MidnightBurst12> land on is a generous term
[0:52:29] <dinnydanny777> The flow of time is convoluted in Star Wars
[0:52:36] <blackskulldragon18> Nihilus is similar to Mr.White. Both are Hungry boy But Mr. white is Demon and Nihilus is a Eldred horror
[0:52:39] <penitentpentwitch> The Woolie is tired
[0:52:46] <phatmac16> next time
[0:52:46] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus I have that list waiting for you

[0:54:27] <%jillpilled> Woolz mad
[0:54:28] <ht109> bioware is jelly of kotor 2
[0:54:30] <ZeeJiggle> I honestly didn't even remember Bao just vanishes until y'all pointed it out.
[0:54:30] <tattleworm> swtor literally gives nihilus powers to other people and says they're the first people to ever use them
[0:54:30] <phatmac16> he goes to his home planet
[0:54:30] <lotharrio> Most we got was Avellone's blog post. Sorry.
[0:54:30] <Djinnazz> THAT'S ALL YOU'RE GETTING
[0:54:31] <snakemuho> Kill him in your heart, BOI
[0:54:31] <dinnydanny777> He was in the range of an explosion

[0:54:33] <$SpecterHDMC> i mean the guy died
[0:54:33] <%CommanderSqueaks> -ANGRY SITH HOLOCRON NOISES-
[0:54:34] <Lefteron> Most die eventually

[0:54:39] <+krispen_wa> SWTOR turns me into Mad Hoe
[0:54:39] <fuji_92> he died get over it
[0:54:41] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> I also heard Woolie is diabetic

[0:54:42] <$SpecterHDMC> thats his story
[0:54:44] <+MidnightBurst12> it's tragic
[0:54:44] <muniea3> woolz mad x24
[0:54:47] <$SpecterHDMC> in swtor
[0:54:50] <%CyanDeadEye> SWTOR acknowledges Mira's existence
[0:54:57] <Djinnazz> SWOTOR was like 6 years ;later
[0:54:57] <lotharrio> Novels apparently acknowledge Bao.
[0:54:58] <%christopherwpoindexter> woolieSHOOK
[0:54:58] <tattleworm> darth jadus is cool tho
[0:55:02] <Monkeyweed21> SWTOR comes and goes who is Bao Durr
[0:55:03] <+krispen_wa> SWTOR sells Mira's jacket in a gacha
[0:55:05] <+jiggy_snipe> Bao-dur isn't as important unfortunately
[0:55:08] <fuji_92> nah, fuck that bullshit he ded
[0:55:11] <%jillpilled> Sadly yeah
[0:55:11] <%Javaa01> (Hook) 14 Months X24
[0:55:12] <snakemuho> oh so it's QA PTSD LUL
[0:55:15] <ZeeJiggle> Unluckers.
[0:55:15] <%christopherwpoindexter> @krispen_wa same
[0:55:17] <Lefteron> @WoolieVersus What are they talking about?
[0:55:17] <Doodle_Taco> INFINETELY
[0:55:18] <+Freeborg1997> I didn't even notice Bao was gone, so it wasn't a problem for me.
[0:55:20] <prime_name> SWTOR makes everything less cool
[0:55:21] <redambr> EA don't care
[0:55:23] <Lefteron> What bug?
[0:55:24] <%jubejube56> Yo is there an uptime timer next to viewer count now?
[0:55:28] <+MidnightBurst12> SWTOR is more of a sequal to KOTOR 1 than KOTOR 2
[0:55:38] <+SolidusRex> You STEAL REVAN'S PANTS
[0:55:42] <+theaceclaw> Vitiate is the hidden threat Revan was after according to SWTOR.
[0:55:53] <%BisoromiBear> real fake spoilers
[0:55:55] <%christopherwpoindexter> oh thank God
[0:55:55] <fuji_92> cmon ppl
[0:56:10] <%Sedrelic> 1 more session?
[0:56:11] <tuesti> Bao-dur is my favorite character because of his potential for so much more
[0:56:39] <+Axelbr> @midnightburst12 it's a sequel to the awful novel and kotor 1 because bioware preffered to ignore kotor 2
[0:57:13] <fuji_92> huh
[0:57:15] <%Camail> you're kinda just a random dude
[0:57:17] <lotharrio> Yo Woolie, was the Exile anyone important?
[0:57:19] <+jiggy_snipe> you're kinda a random guy
[0:57:19] <tattleworm> i feel like it would've been more fitting if he was a total pushover after he tried to force suck you
[0:57:26] <fuji_92> the exile is just a random dude too
[0:57:27] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[0:57:29] <%Ashenik1> @Sedrelic unfortunately
[0:57:29] <zeow31> It's kinda funny that bioware saw Kotor 2 and just copy pasted nihilus but worst
[0:57:34] <%christopherwpoindexter> My headcanon is, which I hope approximately becomes official with some new media, is the Revan and Exile in post-KOTOR 2 canon media like the novel and MMO are fakes/clones, the real ones do the big, key stuff in some sort of KOTOR 3
[0:57:35] <+MidnightBurst12> just some jedi
[0:57:39] <+Axelbr> Exile was a general
[0:57:43] <Monkeyweed21> They just found the motherfucker and start calling him a Darth cuz he's so strong
[0:57:47] <Djinnazz> he ressurected himself.
[0:57:56] <%Chatterbox1991> Kreia maybe found him?
[0:57:59] <+krispen_wa> Darth Jadus was so cool
[0:58:00] <ZeeJiggle> Wha
