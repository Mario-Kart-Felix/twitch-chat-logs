[0:01:51] <Cymen90> @robosqueeb That makes more sense. He sounds nothing like he should given his design.
[0:01:54] <%Necnill> See a physio if you're unsure!
[0:02:03] <%Seancicle> üëãüèª comment √ßa va?

[0:03:15] <BenLubar> @BallerSwagBro9k it was a white check though
[0:03:18] <dylheim93> Going  for walks was the most i could do once my back inflamation dissapated
[0:03:18] <+neoexogene> Did Woolie injure his back ? Just got here
[0:03:36] <%Necnill> @dylheim93 same. Walks are the way
[0:03:41] <dds333a> @neoexogene it was the cause for his brief disappearance

[0:04:07] <Cymen90> Do NOT let it set in
[0:04:09] <dds333a> According to how he described it, he just got up one day, and his back started murdering him
[0:04:10] <am_omega> this game feels great when you know how to Issen really well.

[0:04:22] <%holydeviant1> "Here is the man who revolutionized warfare and united Japan also HE IS LITERALLY A DEMON LORD"
[0:04:22] <+zanz_san> Nobunaga hates churches not paying taxes.
[0:04:26] <LaughinJester> yeah that's a lot
[0:04:27] <+neoexogene> @dds333a oooh I see ! Back injuries really suck, those are debilitating, hope he gets better quickly
[0:04:30] <+megaman_sentinel> this game has tank controls right
[0:04:41] <%OldManJEWc> I wish it was Onimusha 3 issen chaining though @am_omega
[0:04:55] <am_omega> @megaman_sentinel yes, it does and a lock on of sorts
[0:04:56] <dds333a> I'm still running on the theory that he faked a back injury so he could finish GG Lore Kappa
[0:04:57] <iamtheTwitchghost> onimusha 3 is the goat

[0:11:47] <%zeroarturia> Choo Chooo HypeDerp
[0:11:53] <+monsieurfantastic> this game is the sickest shit!!!!

[0:12:01] <%holydeviant1> @Juriasu Samurais Versus Zambies
[0:12:03] <fre3_reign> @juriasu it‚Äôs feudal Japan version of resident evil
[0:12:06] <Blank9> @neoexogene They change almost each game too, right? I think at some point you could do it after all last second dodges, after a good timed guard, or attacking just as you're about to be hit.
[0:12:10] <%Juriasu> whoa
[0:12:11] <%SirGO0SE> if i remember correctly, the puzzles in this game will ruin you and im here for it
[0:12:13] <+Prevot> oh no another recycled best friends idea
[0:12:30] <Blank9> oh thank god
[0:12:34] <CappuccinoGuil> Oh shit, that is really good
[0:12:35] <leith_aziz> ah
[0:12:36] <%holydeviant1> woah what
[0:12:37] <%zeroarturia> @am_omega That was the only thing that disappointed me about the HD port.
[0:12:39] <%holydeviant1> seriously
[0:12:43] <dds333a> Ah, interesting. is there that for other media, like books, or movies?
[0:12:43] <CappuccinoGuil> Oh wow, that's awesome
[0:12:52] <leith_aziz> No spoilers? Nice
[0:12:55] <+cubbywolf> mmm herbs
[0:12:57] <am_omega> oh nice
[0:12:58] <dds333a> A good way to get others into things
[0:13:04] <fre3_reign> Isn‚Äôt that kinda cheating ?
[0:13:09] <+megaman_sentinel> wait there's a no spoiler sight on the internet
[0:13:09] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I,also know absolutely nothing about this series
[0:13:10] <brunoberserk> so people in the chat , i have a question : how bad is the Onimusha 3 pc port ?
[0:13:12] <+neoexogene> @blank9 I definitely remember Onimusha 2 having all of the above, Oni 1 I think was a tad more restricted
[0:13:14] <dds333a> @fre3_reign somewhat, yeah
[0:13:15] <+carmillatype> if you've played onimusha you know
[0:13:21] <+Juriasu> before you play: do combo
[0:13:24] <dds333a> But I think of it more like tips
[0:13:25] <+cubbywolf> is warlords the remakes combined?
[0:13:26] <Blank9> 2 even had the charge attacks too
[0:13:30] <+carmillatype> those herbs are important
[0:13:38] <SonofMelonHead> Won't the game itself have a tutorial?
[0:13:42] <fre3_reign> @dds333a like in resident evil if you knew where the key was and when the boss pops up it takes away
[0:13:43] <CappuccinoGuil> @cubbywolf It's just the 1st game, I believe
[0:13:45] <Blank9> nope
[0:13:49] <pirateofpie> I wasted WAY too much herbs when I played and now I regret it s it lol
[0:13:54] <%Juriasu> LUL
[0:13:58] <%SirGO0SE> oh my god the orbs
[0:14:00] <%X2Eliah> @SonofMelonHead Some games are really not great at explaining stuff in their tutorials
[0:14:01] <+cubbywolf> well i like the 1st thr most
[0:14:08] <am_omega> @cubbywolf nah it's just the PS2 version. The Xbos only additions are still only on the Genma version.
[0:14:14] <%robosqueeb> I am very mixed about onimusha 2, I remember it being really cool but for some reason it felt  cheaper than the first. Idk the right word
[0:14:16] <CappuccinoGuil> ENGLISH DUB YEEEEEEEE
[0:14:18] <dds333a> @fre3_reign hmm, yeah, exactly, but according to what he described, it's without spoilers, but I'm not certain
[0:14:20] <+neoexogene> @sonofmelonhead naaaaah my dude, this game doesn‚Äôt explain half of its systems
[0:14:20] <%SirGO0SE> Kappa
[0:14:20] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @TopTieramisu

[0:25:48] <+cubbywolf> this game was so much fun as a young lad
[0:25:58] <wasdknife> will this be a full play through?
[0:25:58] <%Seancicle> „Çè„Åü„Åó„ÇèÊ≠ªÁ•û‰æç üíØ
[0:25:58] <+athuramn> here's the game manual basically
[0:25:59] <%Pookiedaexzile> Nioh .5
[0:26:05] <Memitim> I remember my parents renting like the 4th one of these for me at a blockbuster and I was so confused
[0:26:07] <%CptnCampy61> Souls come unto me
[0:26:07] <%X2Eliah> So this is Dark Souls 0
[0:26:18] <+Captbutt> @wasdknife hey said he might finish it in 2 sessions, so probably, game's short
[0:26:28] <+cubbywolf> give me your souuul
[0:26:30] <%Pookiedaexzile> Sekiro Shadows almost dead
[0:26:34] <+jamaicanbarber> It‚Äôs DMC upgrade mechanics?
[0:26:44] <%SirGO0SE> @Captbutt I think it's more likely they get stuck on a puzzle for 3 hours straight
[0:26:48] <+cubbywolf> pretty much almoat
[0:26:50] <+FuqBoiSlim> This isn't a very long game isn't it? I feel most capcom games aren't unless they're RPGs
[0:26:51] <GilliamYaeger> use rorbs to upgrade your stuff
[0:26:54] <%Seancicle> üèê
[0:27:02] <+neoexogene> Sekiro: Shadows gotta heal
[0:27:05] <%X2Eliah> Samurai's gotta have a more potent "herb"
[0:27:11] <dds333a> @gilliamyaeger better than Proud Souls
[0:27:12] <KaseKaizer> this game is the missing link between Resident Evil and Devil May Cry
[0:27:15] <+cubbywolf> dont hurt uour back on the way woolie

[0:28:29] <brunoberserk> did you watched Invincible , Reggie ?
[0:28:46] <+cubbywolf> king of the hill writers went to bobs burgers so bobs is just a dif kingofthehill
[0:28:50] <arkv01> think reggie THINK
[0:28:53] <%Seancicle> nous parle au mains
[0:28:57] <%X2Eliah> Ok that was a really fast bathroom break. Turbopiss speed?
[0:29:13] <+cubbywolf> if you miss you miss
[0:29:40] <+StrikeTheErf> primary color and black is aesthetic speedrunning
[0:29:42] <+neoexogene> Red/Black just works, look at Dante
[0:29:45] <arkv01> nioh is basically the spiritual succ to onimusha
[0:29:54] <Indigo_Automaton> (Prerendered Corpse Nothing)
[0:29:55] <%X2Eliah> "corpse: nothing"
[0:29:57] <@Solidus_113> Corpse [Nothing]
[0:30:00] <marcdyllan> At least be a Corpse nothing
[0:30:04] <brunoberserk> at least be a corpse ( NOTHING )
[0:30:06] <pirateofpie> The solution is to use tank controls...
[0:30:08] <asakura_ayase> Corpse:nothing
[0:30:10] <%Pookiedaexzile> Nioh.5
[0:30:11] <+allups> this should've been the peak of graphics
[0:30:14] <%EdenOfSecondAccount> @WoolieVersus Do it in your PS5's settings
[0:30:21] <laserbeaming> Are you on Tank Controls or free movement?
[0:30:23] <%townzzzzz> LUL
[0:30:24] <BlueDragonBot> ReggieVs Nioh, when?
[0:30:25] <%Seancicle> mens sana in corpore sano
[0:30:29] <+Prevot> why y'all squeeze your sticks so much
[0:30:31] <KeiPrime> how do you accidentally L3
[0:30:37] <@Solidus_113> death grip
[0:30:43] <+Prevot> I almost never accidentally press L3 and R3
[0:30:44] <%Vigonept> combos
[0:30:44] <odd_slater> @laserbeaming It should be free movement by default
[0:30:49] <%EdenOfSecondAccount> @WoolieVersus you can do it in your PS5's system settings
[0:30:57] <+Reverend_Roscoe> change it at the "system level"
[0:31:01] <brunoberserk> this version still tank controls right ?
[0:31:03] <jazzcuzzi> noice
[0:31:15] <KeiPrime> ithink you can do both in this release of it
[0:31:26] <+neoexogene> YEYEYE ISSEN
[0:31:29] <jv5_guy> i played the og xbox version before my og xbox died , best decision i ever made
[0:31:45] <%Juriasu> LUL
[0:31:45] <dds333a> HURRY
[0:31:45] <KeiPrime> english voices? i never heard this
[0:31:48] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[0:31:50] <KNYGHT87> BITCH
[0:31:50] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:31:54] <%Lightwolfe> that pok√©mon hidden item shit yeyeye
[0:31:54] <+neoexogene> Oh yeah this game has obscure shit
[0:32:11] <Equirah> "well, i0m not saving him"
[0:32:15] <KeiPrime> theres ps1 footage of like early onimusha it looks cool
[0:32:16] <wasdknife> have your thumb at the side of the stick instead of on the top to avoided clicking it
[0:32:38] <+somenum_bers> he killed...
[0:32:40] <%Juriasu> wow damn
[0:32:41] <%illtima> Look at those three stooges
[0:32:52] <dds333a> I'd be cautious, too
[0:32:52] <%holydeviant1> The bar is mostly to show "wow you got a lot of souls", as far as I know there's no real reason to hold 1 or more bars
[0:32:53] <FriendlyPatches> The should
[0:32:56] <Lionkevinson> #is this a one-off or an Lp?
[0:33:04] <@Solidus_113> full LP
[0:33:06] <deviljhojho_> i mean it was a really ugly hairstyle
[0:33:07] <+neoexogene> ‚ÄúSorry bruh‚Äù
[0:33:09] <FriendlyPatches> That hais is awesome dude
[0:33:16] <wasdknife> bowl cut bad ass
[0:33:17] <pixel_river> true
[0:33:19] <Lionkevinson> Cool
[0:33:20] <dds333a> For real, give them whatever, it's the character
[0:33:25] <%barkon345> Pats Comander Shepard is bald
[0:33:25] <+678saintglock> sometimes you gotta be a coward
[0:33:28] <KeiPrime> coward with your full head of hair
[0:33:28] <%Vigonept> he jobbed tho
[0:33:36] <Indigo_Automaton> Any kind of top knot or ponytail is a weakness in a fight
[0:33:44] <+TopTieramisu> if you don't have a 6head in ancient japan, you ain't seen shit
[0:33:55] <TonberryLives> I love some good ol' pre-rendered backgrounds
[0:33:55] <Equirah> Also, they just went bald LUL
[0:33:55] <+cubbywolf> helped
[0:34:05] <%dreadedcthulhu> "please help me!" *leaves*
[0:34:08] <JayEarly> why did samurai shave their head like that?
[0:34:08] <%Juriasu> LUL
[0:34:09] <+ElDragon_1> Most characters in Kurosawa films have that hair. EXCEPT the protagonist.
[0:34:12] <%X2Eliah> So was ancient japan really hyped for skinheads, or did you need to have the behind-the-ears hair?
[0:34:15] <%barkon345> I remember being completely mind blown by these graphics when this game first came out
[0:34:16] <+cubbywolf> customes
[0:34:18] <%EdenOfSecondAccount> @WoolieVersus change it at the system level
[0:34:22] <+neoexogene> @indigo_automaton any kind of longer hair really, I learned it the hard way
[0:34:23] <%SirGO0SE> my haircut :)
[0:34:23] <pirateofpie> Nice
[0:34:27] <brunoberserk> oooo
[0:34:28] <%robosqueeb> i think you can do finishers on them when they're on the ground, right?
[0:34:34] <+TopTieramisu> RE camera at work
[0:34:38] <Deasmeister> Compressed as shit audio ftw
[0:34:38] <%Kriss1827> the F E A R
[0:34:40] <+StrikeTheErf> bat dot gif
[0:34:44] <%X2Eliah> random bat explosions xD
[0:34:44] <Indigo_Automaton> @barkon345 I think the artstyle helps it look nice despite the age
[0:34:46] <+cubbywolf> the topnot was seen to help keep a helmit on but idk if thats the reason
[0:34:51] <pirateofpie> The tank controls are on the d pad
[0:34:55] <+mexicandetective> This game also has "deflect" issens when you block before an attack and then attack during the spark I believe.
[0:34:55] <%X2Eliah> Woolie has entered the Hole
[0:34:58] <+Fnir> It was tank control
[0:34:58] <Th3rd3> Hololive hole
[0:35:01] <jazzcuzzi> yeah you can execute downed enemies
[0:35:02] <superchunk121> Tank controls on d pad
[0:35:03] <arkv01> the original was tank
[0:35:06] <CappuccinoGuil> d-pad for tank controls
[0:35:10] <+Joe2187> Samonosuke go down the hooooollllee
[0:35:11] <Brothermanhyll> Nioh looks weird
[0:35:12] <arkv01> I think they added the analog directional controls for this
[0:35:17] <FriendlyPatches> dmc1 movement?
[0:35:22] <%X2Eliah> ... what
[0:35:35] <dds333a> yeah, so he'd walk in directions
[0:35:40] <%SirGO0SE> I rock the top knot because barbers are expensive and the ladies seem to like long hair :)
[0:35:41] <%X2Eliah> So it's not tank, but also not fully camera relative.. oh god
[0:36:08] <+athuramn> it's fast tank control
[0:36:09] <%wibbwobbler> Re remake
[0:36:20] <%SirGO0SE> yeah it's hybrid IIRC
[0:36:21] <%X2Eliah> what
[0:36:21] <JayEarly> most of the titular Seven Samurai have that ugly ass, haircut, even the young guy.
[0:36:22] <KNYGHT87> pffffffffffff LUL
[0:36:24] <%X2Eliah> OH god
[0:36:24] <Zeif00> LUL LUL
[0:36:24] <brunoberserk> RE BABY
[0:36:36] <TonberryLives> LOVE IT
[0:36:40] <KeiPrime> onimusha 3 had the best of both worlds, tank controls on d-pad, camera relative on the left stick
[0:36:42] <pixel_river> this is so RE
[0:36:43] <NewbiePov> was thinking of playing this but this re camera kind of a deal breaker
[0:37:05] <+Fnir> Not a mask LUL
[0:37:09] <%X2Eliah> The background art of these notes is nice
[0:37:10] <GilliamYaeger> Megabuster!
[0:37:19] <%SirGO0SE> @newbiepov don't let it stop you. the game is a unique experience
[0:37:25] <%X2Eliah> wait Ogres?
[0:37:27] <rekinom> God what a beautiful mistranslation
[0:37:32] <+froduck42> Oni
[0:37:32] <+athuramn> I could've sworn they added a different movement style in the remaster
[0:37:33] <%X2Eliah> .. is ... are Ogres a japan thing?
[0:37:33] <CappuccinoGuil> AHHHHH Firefox just changed its UI WutFace
[0:37:33] <%EdenOfSecondAccount> Without the Swamp, you are no match for the Demoines
[0:37:39] <rekinom> Oni means Ogre, which is the only real word in Japanese for demon, too
[0:37:41] <+Fnir> Ogres = Oni
[0:37:42] <pixel_river> the real nioh
[0:37:43] <+neoexogene> Without the Oni powers you‚Äôs a bitch
[0:37:44] <+captain_history> yeah, in 1 they translate Oni as Ogre
[0:37:47] <huskarl_zap> that seems like oni propaganda to me
[0:38:04] <+StrikeTheErf> demon souls, come unto me
[0:38:06] <rekinom> "You need the power of the Oni/Ogre?demons to beat the Oni/Ogre/Demons"
[0:38:08] <GilliamYaeger> I expect the original words were Ogre=Oni and Demon=Akuma
[0:38:14] <Equirah> Gotta use those Ogre Tactics
[0:38:16] <%SirGO0SE> in Japan Shrek is a demon
[0:38:16] <Brothermanhyll> Ogremusha
[0:38:18] <GilliamYaeger> Or Majin
[0:38:21] <asakura_ayase> Demons souls is the onimusha of dark souls
[0:38:32] <+Reverend_Roscoe> delay based onimusha
[0:38:33] <%X2Eliah> Yeah, OgreMusha. What does "musha" mean?
[0:38:37] <laserbeaming> I think the enemies are called Genma in the following ghames
[0:38:37] <Indigo_Automaton> Wait that box was wider than the vase
[0:38:39] <%Vigonept> i thought majin was demon , or that anime lying
[0:38:42] <SonofMelonHead> @SirGO0SE You telling me Shrek isn't already a demon here?
[0:38:46] <CappuccinoGuil> @Indigo_Automaton shut up, tho
[0:38:46] <Equirah> look, they wanted to keep the difference between types and so chose not to have "demon" twice
[0:38:57] <pixel_river> So oni in sf4 is shrek ?
[0:38:58] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:39:07] <elderpunch> u mean yokai?
[0:39:14] <rekinom> @X2Eliah Musha means Samurai
[0:39:16] <GilliamYaeger> Ah
[0:39:18] <KeiPrime> i thought musha is warrior so literally it'd be ogre warrior?
[0:39:20] <Indigo_Automaton> I guess they got that ancient non euclidian pottery
[0:39:21] <GilliamYaeger> The demons are the Genma clan
[0:39:24] <+captain_history> @X2Eliah Musha is warrior/samurai, so Oni Warrior
[0:39:26] <+athuramn> the cave seems to be a nest for demons. they call themselves "demons" Kappa
[0:39:27] <brunoberserk> Sougen's Bizarre Adventures
[0:39:27] <%X2Eliah> @X2Eliah ah ok, thanks

[0:40:48] <Torgue_1> Oh Reggie LUL
[0:40:49] <Brothermanhyll> This really is RE
[0:40:49] <%robosqueeb> thats not a key item is it?
[0:40:51] <@Menitta> Reminds me of that one puzzle in Sonic Adventure
[0:40:54] <%robosqueeb> because if it is thats fucked
[0:40:56] <+athuramn> OH DO THEY EVER
[0:40:56] <pirateofpie> Hopefully.... Kappa
[0:41:01] <pi_in_the_sci> It open s a secret area
[0:41:13] <+paulomega7> Is this a first playthrough for the both of them?
[0:41:15] <laserbeaming> The puzzles got relatively better on later games
[0:41:19] <majindusto> Look at this Resident  Evil-ass game
[0:41:19] <CappuccinoGuil> You gotta use the jewels
[0:41:22] <Indigo_Automaton> Or the wind
[0:41:23] <disflipmat> owl.wav
[0:41:33] <%X2Eliah> So I legit have problems seeing what parts are "wall" and what parts are "area transition"
[0:41:35] <Solidnick18> that and the pot smashing sound
[0:41:39] <+IxDomxI> totsugeki
[0:41:39] <%illtima> There's also one stock Wolf dying sound
[0:41:41] <jazzcuzzi> this game has directional moves like forward plus slash iirc, but I don't know if they can be pulled off with the analog stick
[0:41:43] <%livlinn> shandOwl shandOwl shandOwl
[0:41:45] <+StrikeTheErf> breaking pottery is the worst
[0:41:46] <%illtima> I heard it in Warcraft 3 and Nier Replicant lol

[0:41:47] <+athuramn> those are rare candies, use eeemmmm
[0:41:52] <brunoberserk> OH BOY THIS ONE IS HARD
[0:41:58] <+zanz_san> try to change the controls through system?
[0:42:00] <%robosqueeb> theres a very certain point in this game where puzzle skills matter and im so dumb that it blocked me for so long
[0:42:08] <+carmillatype> you can read these right?
[0:42:11] <+captain_history> this like DMC, it's a RE based game before RE4 was even a thing and went through some many iterations
[0:42:14] <Brothermanhyll> Woolievs bird
[0:42:14] <majindusto> Royalty-free Pot Smash SFX

[0:44:33] <laserbeaming> I don't care either way
[0:44:37] <SuplexSammiches> make a poll
[0:44:37] <IzanagiNoOokami> Cheating is lit.
[0:44:38] <+neoexogene> @sirgo0se Honor is for dumbasses look at the beginning cinematic in Ghost of Tsushima
[0:44:41] <majindusto> NO CHEAT
[0:44:48] <tattleworm> cheating'd be some ronin shit
[0:44:48] <pi_in_the_sci> There is literally no reason to sit on a magic jewel
[0:44:52] <@Menitta> do it
[0:44:58] <tzuin21> it's basically a purple orb, use it SeemsGood
[0:45:02] <%EdenOfSecondAccount> Spinny boys!
[0:45:05] <%Seancicle> üî§
[0:45:08] <CappuccinoGuil> Jewels are permanent upgrades. Use them freely
[0:45:10] <Brothermanhyll> No cheat unless stuck
[0:45:13] <dredgyboi> those spinny boys kinda make you learn to parry
[0:45:15] <iamtheTwitchghost> have we gotten an issen yet?
[0:45:18] <+LokimenD> also blocking is free
[0:45:23] <leith_aziz> @neoexogene: Honor died on the beach!
[0:45:25] <shinryu1331> use lock and d pad to strafe
[0:45:25] <+athuramn> twice @iamthetwitchghost
[0:45:26] <majindusto> Only Cowards Cheat
[0:45:32] <iamtheTwitchghost> nice @athuramn
[0:45:38] <+captain_history> Bushido is kind of like chivalry, it was a thing for books but nobody was dumb enough to actually follow it to the book
[0:45:45] <%Vigonept> we're Ll cl
[0:45:51] <jazzcuzzi> you got a parry there. you can issen after that
[0:45:59] <+athuramn> welcome to the police statio-...
[0:46:00] <+Captbutt> das a big boi
[0:46:00] <%X2Eliah> Isn't Bushido largely just revisionism of history?
[0:46:04] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:46:05] <CappuccinoGuil> @captain_history also, it was basically propaganda.
[0:46:06] <+neoexogene> @captain_history appropriate name given the fact you just gave
[0:46:12] <robosqueeb> most talented samurai in the world who unfortunately also can never remember where he is LUL
[0:46:17] <jazzcuzzi> YE
[0:46:25] <Brothermanhyll> The true samurai execution is to break an oar over someones skull
[0:46:30] <pirateofpie> Haven't figured out how to win those clashes yet
[0:46:46] <pirateofpie> Though I did once on accident. Mashing maybe?
[0:46:46] <+captain_history> @X2Eliah Yeah, basically it's Edo and Meiji historical reviosionism to give a national identity to Japan.
[0:46:53] <Equirah> UI offscreen?
[0:46:56] <shinryu1331> if you use r1/L1 for lock on u can strafe dodge
[0:47:11] <Indigo_Automaton> Right in the dick
[0:47:13] <Torgue_1> Chat, I missed it; is this Woolie'f first playthrough?
[0:47:13] <%X2Eliah> So is there any kind of dodge or roll?
[0:47:21] <%X2Eliah> @Torgue_1 seems like it, yes
[0:47:24] <+neoexogene> @torgue_1 yep !
[0:47:24] <+athuramn> you know, this might be the most well suited playthrough for people who enjoy fighting games because there's a pretty big counter and footsie game in this
[0:47:37] <+athuramn> *well suited game
[0:47:42] <shinryu1331> @x2eliah theres a lock on and u use d pad tank controls to dash in 4 directions
[0:47:56] <%SirGO0SE> @athuramn good observation tbh. wish this franchise got a reboot
[0:48:01] <+neoexogene> This is a good early game souls farming spot
[0:48:10] <+captain_history> there is a parry and evade yeah
[0:48:18] <%X2Eliah> Is this one of those games where you *have* to farm?
[0:48:31] <pirateofpie> @X2Eliah Kinda yeah
[0:48:38] <shinryu1331> a bit...if u invest in weapons instead of orbs then yes
[0:48:41] <+mexicandetective> for certain doors yeah
[0:48:43] <+athuramn> Instead we got a slow burning art piece that ends up in doodoo @sirgo0se
[0:48:46] <CappuccinoGuil> @X2Eliah not really. There are "level" locked spots, but you get plenty of souls naturally
[0:49:03] <+athuramn> and no, I don't think so. @x2eliah @cappuccinoguil puts it nicely
[0:49:04] <%Seancicle> üîñ
[0:49:23] <CappuccinoGuil> But you can farm, and there is a cap to upgrades
[0:49:26] <pirateofpie> I had to farm since I focused on weapons first lol
[0:49:42] <CappuccinoGuil> @pirateofpie lol fair, that can happen
[0:49:45] <brunoberserk> this game plays more like a Resident Evil
[0:50:02] <shinryu1331> they combine the orbs and weapons in later games...oni 2 doesn't even have level locks
[0:50:02] <+Cuon_Alpinus> Green Herbs LUL
[0:50:06] <+athuramn> this is you're resident evil police station. by back tracking through that courtyard often you end up accruing a lot of experience
[0:50:06] <Brothermanhyll> Capgod
[0:50:12] <+athuramn> your*
[0:50:21] <+vexion_smh> YOOOOOOO???
[0:50:22] <shinryu1331> woolie no!
[0:50:26] <MaddyCaddy> haha...
[0:50:28] <+neoexogene> I really wish Capcom acknowledges Onimusha at all in some way
[0:50:29] <%X2Eliah> Uhm.
[0:50:34] <brunoberserk> save the game
[0:50:38] <+athuramn> eh, it's not the worst choice
[0:50:39] <%X2Eliah> Idk man, usually the starting gear is the worst
[0:50:40] <CappuccinoGuil> Saaaaaave
[0:50:51] <+neoexogene> Like at least port the other two games
[0:50:55] <CappuccinoGuil> Bold move, let's see if pays off

[0:59:34] <+vexion_smh> oooo
[0:59:34] <IzanagiNoOokami> That's a fuckin Red Ranger Sword.
[0:59:35] <%robosqueeb> womp womp
[0:59:36] <Puhff> LESGOOO
[0:59:38] <%X2Eliah> So swords are also door unlockers?
[0:59:44] <CappuccinoGuil> Honestly, it's good to upgrade ALL weapons in this, Woolz
[0:59:47] <+captain_history> this is the heavy sword and the other is the quick one, both are good
[0:59:53] <CappuccinoGuil> WOOLIE, LOOK AT THE FLOOR
[0:59:56] <+athuramn> this is probably the weapon that gets most vastly improved through upgrades
[0:59:58] <CappuccinoGuil> LOOK AT THAT BERSERK
[1:00:00] <FalseKingAki> no tank controls?

[1:00:05] <+royscreen> return the slaaaaaab, or suffer my cuuuuuuuurse
[1:00:13] <%AlteisenReiseZ> WOOLIE GO BACK AND LOOK AT THE FLOOR
[1:00:19] <+Dova573> Flame breathing? Kappa
[1:00:22] <fre3_reign> @royscreen and you sir got a follow from me for that joke
[1:00:25] <shinryu1331> raizan is a grab. enryu is an aor
[1:00:28] <shinryu1331> aoe
[1:00:32] <CappuccinoGuil> LOOK AT THAT BERSERK LUL
[1:00:37] <%AlteisenReiseZ> The Brand!
[1:00:38] <Solidnick18> i see
[1:00:39] <%X2Eliah> Woolie just use the floor
[1:00:41] <+patel347> he was just saying it was berserk reference
[1:00:42] <brunoberserk> BERSERK REFERENCE
[1:00:45] <Gorshum> Berserk!
[1:00:48] <stormhawk9891> Oh that's just a Brand
[1:00:52] <%robosqueeb> my braand
[1:00:56] <arkv01> put your grasses on!
[1:01:00] <CappuccinoGuil> Oh god, EVERYTHING got influenced
[1:01:06] <+royscreen> @fre3_reign I see you are also a person with good taste
[1:01:09] <BlackermanZX> oh literally a brand LUL
[1:01:09] <Solidnick18> yeah
[1:01:13] <Daxalog> Oh really?
[1:01:18] <Zeif00> Berserk Secondaries
[1:01:20] <prime_name> yuppers
[1:01:25] <@Menitta> I believe it
[1:01:28] <fre3_reign> @royscreen I am cultured
[1:01:36] <GilliamYaeger> All the swords are good to upgrade because they don't share magic bars - you can burn through meter on one sword then swap to another and have a full meter again.
[1:01:39] <%X2Eliah> .... sci-fi?
[1:01:39] <CappuccinoGuil> Woolie, also, each weapon has an individual magic bar. Keep that in mind.
[1:01:42] <TonberryLives> Que Theme of Guts
[1:01:43] <%robosqueeb> nickelodeon guts? yep. thats guts
[1:01:52] <pirateofpie> Fuck these things
[1:01:53] <+mrbones41> blasphemous
[1:01:54] <brunoberserk> SUCC
[1:01:56] <+megaman_sentinel> kill them kill them quick
[1:01:58] <%SirGO0SE> these guys are a problem without the bow
[1:02:03] <SonofMelonHead> Berserk was wildly influential. rightfully so
[1:02:04] <FalseKingAki> dont let them get away with it
[1:02:08] <+patel347> use thrust
[1:02:09] <%SirGO0SE> and theyre kind of problem with the bow too
[1:02:09] <Indigo_Automaton> SKELETON BALLS
[1:02:12] <+Arek_1> They steal souls and multiply them.
[1:02:14] <%robosqueeb> these guys give butt tons of souls
[1:02:33] <odd_slater> Flying buttholes
[1:02:44] <+Hawksworthers> This song though!
[1:02:48] <shinryu1331> absorbing multiple souls gives a bonus
[1:02:51] <%wibbwobbler> Every villain wants to be Griffith
[1:02:54] <FalseKingAki> dont they multiply the souls they eat
[1:02:57] <CappuccinoGuil> If you know the meta, those guys are good for farming
[1:03:15] <shinryu1331> ORB
[1:03:26] <GilliamYaeger> ENHANCE ORB
[1:03:27] <CappuccinoGuil> Woolie, each weapon has a magic bar.
[1:03:28] <+Captbutt> yeyeye
[1:03:28] <+captain_history> Onimusha OST it's always great, that's a thing in all entries
[1:03:32] <%SirGO0SE> enhance orb
[1:03:33] <shinryu1331> GET THE ORB
[1:03:35] <%robosqueeb> yooo i forgot they get cooler looking!
[1:03:52] <+athuramn> raizan has more vertical @woolieversus
[1:03:54] <brunoberserk> orbs are keys
[1:03:55] <+patel347> the orb is for doors only
[1:03:58] <pi_in_the_sci> Enhancing the orb makes it a better key
[1:04:00] <+patel347> weapon is for damage
[1:04:09] <shinryu1331> now do lightning orb
[1:04:15] <stormhawk9891> Yep
[1:04:15] <%robosqueeb> yepyep
[1:04:16] <CappuccinoGuil> Yes, there should be a quick switch
[1:04:17] <MaddyCaddy> Yes
[1:04:17] <brunoberserk> yes
[1:04:17] <Torgue_1> Yes
[1:04:18] <+megaman_sentinel> yes
[1:04:24] <CoffeeKaiju> oh god why does the meter go backwards?!
[1:04:26] <shinryu1331> L2 I think
[1:04:27] <+patel347> should be l2 or r2
[1:04:31] <brunoberserk> SAVE THE GAME
[1:04:32] <CappuccinoGuil> Try shoulders?
[1:04:32] <+captain_history> there is a quick switch i think?
[1:04:34] <shinryu1331> L2 for quick change
[1:04:38] <fre3_reign> Yes
[1:04:38] <GilliamYaeger> Yes, they do NOT share magic meters so you have triple magic bars
[1:04:43] <CappuccinoGuil> YEYEYEYEYE WE BEEN SAYING IT!
[1:04:47] <HoldBtoRun> yeyeye
[1:04:49] <+wunp_fxs> yeyeyeyey

[1:04:54] <shinryu1331> what do u mean?this was made with tank controls
[1:04:56] <huskarl_zap> ZAPPING SYSTEM
[1:04:57] <+patel347> lock on with tank controlls is the way to play

[1:04:58] <%dreadedcthulhu> the SHMOOVEMENT
[1:05:00] <MaddyCaddy> There was only tank controls in the original
[1:05:02] <+athuramn> the footsie game (y)
[1:05:02] <%SirGO0SE> Patrick Boivin has entered the chat
[1:05:04] <+patel347> you can side step with tank controlls
[1:05:05] <%wibbwobbler> D pad?
[1:05:07] <Torgue_1> The way it's meant to be played!
[1:05:10] <%BallerSwagBro9k> psaDab psaDab psaDab psaDab psaDab
[1:05:15] <+thecraye> we only lack the ZAPPING SYSTEM now
[1:05:16] <Toni_Master43> That's that good shit

[1:05:19] <%jinking79> Fail RE4 game Hell Yeah
[1:05:22] <pirateofpie> ...I didn't even know about the quick switch lol
[1:05:25] <FalseKingAki> those are the original controls
[1:05:27] <+allups> when are we ganna get Clair B woolie
[1:05:28] <+athuramn> @thecraye LITTLE DO YOU KNOW
[1:05:28] <dds333a> @wibbwobbler yeah, either the just use the Pad or the stick
[1:05:32] <shinryu1331> quick switch is new for rerelease
[1:05:32] <+patel347> the remaster added the analouge
[1:05:47] <Toni_Master43> Anything else for RE would not fit
[1:05:48] <paaadaawan> HELL YEAH WOOLIE TIME
[1:05:52] <stormhawk9891> @WoolieVersus Tank controls actually work better when locked on
[1:05:56] <%holydeviant1> oh god te soul suckers
[1:05:56] <%townzzzzz> tanks aren't afraid of shit
[1:05:58] <Puhff> psaBougie psaUp psaBougie psaUp psaBougie psaUp
[1:06:00] <+Nero_Cross> This is one of the RE4 children, yeah. DMC1 was a branch off of a build of this where a bug had enemies get juggled by all your hits.
[1:06:00] <tzuin21> ps2 version had only tank controls MingLee
[1:06:03] <whatatkins> Tank controls work better with fixed camera angles
[1:06:06] <shinryu1331> woolie learned about issen before tank controls I'm done man
[1:06:09] <CappuccinoGuil> lul
[1:06:12] <+megaman_sentinel> bye-bye
[1:06:12] <CappuccinoGuil> LUL
[1:06:12] <dds333a> And boy were there a significant amount of games that had them too
[1:06:16] <brunoberserk> @WoolieVersus you have to sve the game in the mirrors , the game dont have autosave
[1:06:17] <%X2Eliah> LUL
[1:06:17] <%holydeviant1> Soul suck them in!
[1:06:20] <%dreadedcthulhu> riparino?
[1:06:23] <CappuccinoGuil> No, they teleport away
[1:06:25] <%robosqueeb> cucked ;_;
[1:06:27] <Solidnick18> LUL
[1:06:29] <%X2Eliah> So how do you get at them?
[1:06:30] <HoldBtoRun> shit's gone
[1:06:30] <+Arek_1> The fire sword has better vertical range.
[1:06:31] <+patel347> you can use thrust I think to get them easier
[1:06:32] <CappuccinoGuil> That was a 3rd one that popped in
[1:06:35] <Torgue_1> Jebaited
[1:06:36] <%holydeviant1> If you keep soulsucking I think they get drawn in?
[1:06:41] <AnacondaVirtue> Apparently the flying balls multiply the orbs they absorb, if you manage to kill them
[1:06:42] <zentzen> dont you have the bow yet
[1:06:51] <dds333a> Get robbed
[1:06:54] <+athuramn> @x2eliah bows
[1:06:55] <pirateofpie> Bow comes later
[1:06:56] <+pupil31> This music is epic
[1:06:58] <%SirGO0SE> not yet
[1:06:58] <%X2Eliah> woolie has nobow
[1:06:59] <shinryu1331> I think either turning ur back or absorbing is a trick to get them closer...not entirely sure though
[1:07:03] <pi_in_the_sci> Soul sucking should drag those guys to you
[1:07:03] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:07:05] <CappuccinoGuil> Woolz, swap weapons and look at the magic bar
[1:07:11] <%Necnill> oh, it's set in Canada
[1:07:19] <dds333a> @anacondavirtue as you'd expect, yeah
[1:07:29] <itzjsmithbubble> Gah damn this takes me back
[1:07:30] <%SirGO0SE> correct
[1:07:34] <+athuramn> @necnill yes indeed, this is little Italy in ottawa
[1:07:36] <+patel347> woolie use lock on and tank controls to sidestep
[1:07:40] <CappuccinoGuil> So on bosses? DUMP THE MAGIC LUL
[1:07:45] <shinryu1331> absorbing blue souls refills for all weaps
[1:07:53] <%holydeviant1> Welcome to the RE manor
[1:07:56] <CappuccinoGuil> @shinryu1331 oh damn I forgot that
[1:07:59] <+Fnir> RE sounds
[1:08:03] <brunoberserk> '' WHAT A MANSION ... ''
[1:08:04] <+walt_chocolate> heh, the last weapon is my fav
[1:08:05] <%SirGO0SE> look at the little guy :)
[1:08:06] <%holydeviant1> oh, and the new Fuck You mob
[1:08:12] <CappuccinoGuil> Did this game have a quick turn before RE4?
[1:08:14] <dds333a> Isn't this a stage in Last Blade CarlSmile
[1:08:18] <shinryu1331> get ready for an asswhooping
[1:08:27] <shinryu1331> from red dude
[1:08:28] <Puhff> GUN?!@
[1:08:29] <MaddyCaddy> Controls spoilers...
[1:08:37] <%holydeviant1> @Puhff Gun
[1:08:47] <tattleworm> it's so funny seeing the term tank controls in game
[1:08:53] <Puhff> GUNGUNGUNGUN
[1:08:56] <CoffeeKaiju> gun
[1:08:58] <%SirGO0SE> @Puhff Kaede is a weapon Kappa
[1:09:00] <fre3_reign> Old enough for no tutorial, he must not play Bloodborne
[1:09:02] <%robosqueeb> control spoilers can be kinda hype if ya think about it
[1:09:02] <+walt_chocolate> yeah I'm not saying anymore
[1:09:04] <shinryu1331> it did have a 180 turn
[1:09:10] <CappuccinoGuil> We got strafing, babyyyyy
[1:09:12] <BlackermanZX> damn they actually say tank controls
[1:09:13] <shinryu1331> I think its gone though
[1:09:26] <+athuramn> hell yeah they do @blackermanzx
[1:09:28] <Puhff> @SirGO0SE to surpass metal gear?! :O
[1:09:29] <+captain_history> you can issen multiple enemies in 1 chat?
[1:09:33] <shinryu1331> door to the left
[1:09:39] <dds333a> @blackermanzx yeah, it's not really a colloquialism
[1:09:49] <+penguinlords> @captain_history no that's 2 and beyond
[1:09:51] <+patel347> lockon gives you a stab too
[1:09:52] <%OblivionSword1> is it DMC 1 lock on ?
[1:09:58] <+patel347> its really good for the blue guys
[1:10:02] <BlackermanZX> that strafe seems good
[1:10:17] <shinryu1331> I dont like lock on in future games cause it auto charges weapons when I dont want to
[1:10:20] <brunoberserk> yes
[1:10:21] <%SirGO0SE> @Puhff I wish, she a cutie
[1:10:28] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Please tell me you're playing 2 after this, it feels like a demo to 2 for me
[1:10:31] <Orfington> so it's like... blue keycard lvl 1, red keycard lvl 2, sort of thing?
[1:10:34] <Orfington> for the orbs?
[1:10:36] <pi_in_the_sci> you have to eventually level every orb to the end
[1:10:42] <+patel347> you will basically max everything in the end anyways
[1:10:42] <CappuccinoGuil> @Orfington basically
[1:10:47] <+patel347> especially with the bloodypalace thing
[1:10:52] <%robosqueeb> youll get enough souls eventually to just pump everything i reckon
[1:10:53] <MaddyCaddy> There's plenty of orbs throughout the game to max everything out
[1:10:55] <+athuramn> sword first *cough*
[1:11:05] <laserbeaming> Maybe level up the orbs as you encounter the locks?
[1:11:09] <CappuccinoGuil> This is an okay map, I like it
[1:11:15] <shinryu1331> prioritise locks
[1:11:24] <pi_in_the_sci> there's a bloody palace you unlock to pump everything to the end
[1:11:29] <fre3_reign> You can always find a door again
[1:11:30] <CappuccinoGuil> I basically went "level everything up equally"
[1:11:33] <shinryu1331> oni 2 had such a weird story mode with the item trading
[1:11:33] <%OblivionSword1> BIG DAMAFE vs DO COMBO
[1:11:34] <%robosqueeb> does red sword need more magic?
[1:11:35] <fre3_reign> You need stronger weapons
[1:11:41] <%robosqueeb> or did sucking those in fill both?
[1:11:52] <shinryu1331> sucking blue fills all magic
[1:11:57] <CappuccinoGuil> @robosqueeb sucking blue orbs fills all magic bars
[1:12:02] <tattleworm> @WoolieVersus upgrading orbs also improves your magic attacks so there's damage reasons there too
[1:12:14] <%robosqueeb> oh groovy
[1:12:17] <%holydeviant1> Oh, this fucker.
[1:12:17] <%X2Eliah> oh nooo
[1:12:20] <Solidnick18> quiet!
[1:12:23] <%holydeviant1> (referring to BOTH)
[1:12:40] <+LokimenD> monke!
[1:12:42] <dds333a> the very same
[1:12:47] <%livlinn> STAHP
[1:12:49] <shinryu1331> this entire game is a level in nioh 2 btw (historically)
[1:12:51] <KeiPrime> nioh 2
[1:12:54] <%Necnill> The accent... the pronunciation.... kanpeki
[1:12:55] <Indigo_Automaton> WHAT?
[1:12:56] <Solidnick18> ooooh
[1:12:56] <KeiPrime> hell yeah dude
[1:12:56] <%OblivionSword1> oh hey MONKE
[1:12:57] <srv4254> it is just nioh 2 now
[1:13:01] <%BallerSwagBro9k> THATS HIDEYOSHI?
[1:13:03] <AnacondaVirtue> Man this is a far ass way from Nioh 2's
[1:13:03] <Solidnick18> hideyoshi!
[1:13:11] <dds333a> this guy should be a big help
[1:13:12] <%OblivionSword1> yes that's hideyoshi
[1:13:12] <+Dova573> Thats just Yoshi
[1:13:13] <shinryu1331> but with the good evil roles flipped
[1:13:15] <+ElDragon_1> Holy crap. Toyotomi.
[1:13:19] <+Dova573> Without the hide
[1:13:26] <%OblivionSword1> hidwyoshi started out as a jobber to nobunaga
[1:13:26] <CappuccinoGuil> Samanosuke is only commanded by the coochie
[1:13:28] <%robosqueeb> hehe :)
[1:13:30] <Teyaric> "I am a HYPERRADICAL, you CLANNIST."
[1:13:30] <%holydeviant1> (just walks right through a sealed door)
[1:13:32] <dds333a> If you said THAT at the time, people will put that to the test
[1:13:35] <Torgue_1> Wait, Woolie's not playing in Japanese?!
[1:13:37] <Sternieliscious> Hell of a prequel to Resident Evil 0. I wonder if Wesker shows up.
[1:13:54] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Is this game historically accurate? Kappa
[1:13:56] <+athuramn> you tell him, you cardboard weirdo
[1:13:57] <%Seancicle> au revoir. cul8r
[1:14:27] <%robosqueeb> @BallerSwagBro9k it takes place during the Zombo period
[1:14:27] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:14:30] <CappuccinoGuil> "you fuck young boys, Hideyoshi?"
[1:14:35] <KeiPrime> classic RE, get the ammo before the weapon
[1:14:36] <KeiPrime> as a tease
[1:14:48] <Teyaric> Hideyoshi was origionally a peasant who worked his way up, so being a pedo is... Unlikely.
[1:14:58] <+Arek_1> @CappuccinoGuil LUL
[1:15:15] <+captain_history> it was 3 the one that basically had a Bloody Palace?
[1:15:20] <%X2Eliah> wait there are bows on that wall
[1:15:21] <%Vigonept> monster hunter does that, the arrow stabs
[1:15:27] <%X2Eliah> behind the chest
[1:15:38] <%holydeviant1> @Vigonept monster hunter uses spears for arrows, come on
[1:15:39] <dds333a> I wonder if his master is actually dead.....
[1:15:41] <+athuramn> dawn of dreams I think @captain_history

[1:17:44] <%robosqueeb> with strafe dpad feels okay
[1:17:46] <MaddyCaddy> It was the original controls
[1:17:46] <+patel347> d pad was the original
[1:17:49] <KeiPrime> yeah thats kinda the real way to play, dpad for locking on
[1:17:50] <CappuccinoGuil> The tank control is teh original
[1:17:52] <dds333a> I dunno, I feel it works
[1:17:53] <+patel347> they added the other in the remaster
[1:18:02] <CappuccinoGuil> They added the analog to Warlords

[1:20:25] <shinryu1331> sont let woolie leave this puzzle unfinished
[1:20:29] <+BelieverBill> This game has a Ninja Gaiden vibe, which has me ready for June 10th!
[1:20:29] <shinryu1331> dont

[1:21:20] <%X2Eliah> Oh so the bow was 100% missable

[1:21:25] <+athuramn> WE IN THIS SHIT NOW BOYS
[1:21:28] <dds333a> I got it, yeah, just before Woolie solved it LUL
[1:21:28] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1399615868909334535
[1:21:30] <shinryu1331> each onimusha game had its own unique puzzle
[1:21:31] <keankong85> now you can shoot
[1:21:31] <brunoberserk> CUT THE ROPE
[1:21:34] <%X2Eliah> 10 arrows
[1:21:49] <EvolNom> Woolie love your podcast man, you get me through the work day
[1:21:50] <%robosqueeb> it should be like shooting a re gun
[1:21:51] <yuribo26> Onimusha? What year is it PogChamp
[1:21:52] <shinryu1331> I remember in 3 there was a special mode where it had all 3 puzzle types from 3 oni games
[1:21:56] <%robosqueeb> r1 to aim and attack to shoot
[1:21:57] <%holydeviant1> you have to cut the rope . exe
[1:22:07] <stardustno1r> Puzzles are the weakest part of this game tbh, kinda like the first Fatal Frame
[1:22:09] <%X2Eliah> R3
[1:22:13] <CappuccinoGuil> Is there something in the back there?
[1:22:20] <+captain_history> @X2Eliah Samanosuke kunoichi attendant. This game was from an era that assumed you read the character profiles in the game manual.
[1:22:26] <brunoberserk> NICE
[1:22:27] <%ShinobiPhoenix> ShinobiPhoenix subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 2 month streak! Happy Pride Month, have some BezoBucks.  They are at least worth more than BisonBucks.
[1:22:31] <+Arek_1> Threaded the needle.
[1:22:32] <GilliamYaeger> nice
[1:22:33] <%robosqueeb> there we go!
[1:22:49] <%X2Eliah> LUL
[1:22:51] <brunoberserk> LUL LUL LUL

[1:22:57] <CappuccinoGuil> You get all these, you can solve those puzzles
[1:23:00] <laserbeaming> Have Fun!
[1:23:05] <dds333a> Shoutouts to instruction manuals with a notes section
[1:23:23] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Ah yes, when gamers had to backtrack endlessly
[1:23:27] <shinryu1331> go down a floor
[1:23:37] <%robosqueeb> it fell down da hole
[1:23:39] <%X2Eliah> no
[1:23:41] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @dds333a Except now everyone has phones they can write notes in and take pictures of puzzle clues.
[1:23:46] <shinryu1331> cause u cut the rope
[1:23:50] <+xerotwo> doodWat
[1:23:57] <+carmillatype> I had a notebook specifically for la mulana 2 ready when that came out
[1:24:00] <+carmillatype> good times
[1:24:39] <dds333a> @shinobiphoenix indeed, which is just an extension of that. when I didn't have those things, I would write down things to remember in the notes section, hence the shoutout
[1:24:40] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I still have notes in my Google Keep just for tracking loot I needed in Breath of the Wild to keep track of hunting
[1:24:53] <TonberryLives> @WoolieVersus There's a parry in the game by the way
[1:24:58] <+Arek_1> LUL
[1:25:15] <%robosqueeb> i think its attack when the enemy does
[1:25:18] <%ShinobiPhoenix> or to me, shout out to New 3DS have a a built in notepad that you could draw in and take screenshots based on what you were looking at in game
[1:25:24] <CappuccinoGuil> You get free refills, but your magic is full
[1:25:26] <shinryu1331> the issen can be done off a block or an attack if u time it right
[1:25:26] <%robosqueeb> i could be wrong
[1:25:51] <Sternieliscious> I'm super thinking of a stream of adventure games and seeing brains explode over obtuse logic.
[1:25:51] <CappuccinoGuil> THIS GUY

[1:26:37] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Is the protagonist holding the Soul Edge?
[1:26:38] <%holydeviant1> Demon invasions come with some wild side effects

[1:27:39] <IzanagiNoOokami> Cheating is lit.

[1:28:06] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I mean Resident Evil
[1:28:20] <%robosqueeb> @WoolieVersus let the orb bois suck up da souls, then spank em with an arrow and they shoot out tons
[1:28:20] <brunoberserk> just cheat , woolz , HAVE FUN MaxLOL
[1:28:21] <+royscreen> those floating enemies are the BEST way to get more souls in this game, they multiply ones dropped by enemies
[1:28:31] <+ar4ndomblackguy> take breaks from stream/procrastination to do responsibilities. thats my way of life
[1:28:31] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:28:42] <KUYAmoPESh> This is a good surprise! It sure pays a lot to not keep tabs on the sched.
[1:28:49] <shinryu1331> it still astonishes me how they pump out RE games like crazy but oni gets one update in like 13 years
[1:28:53] <+Arek_1> Coming in late, sorry. But yeah, there is essentially Royal Release and Royal Block. Just without the gauges.
[1:28:56] <+Fnir> yes they do
[1:28:59] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Yes.....they do
[1:29:05] <+xerotwo> oof
[1:29:09] <+PyrokidSosa> looks like it plays like some sort of old-age resident evil :O

[1:29:52] <dds333a> oh boy CarlSmile
[1:29:58] <%holydeviant1> At least you admit it unlike some minecraft streamers Kappa
[1:29:59] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[1:30:06] <%robosqueeb> so the demons would be the last option
[1:30:07] <+xerotwo> LUL
[1:30:09] <CappuccinoGuil> There are multiple files to find
[1:30:12] <%robosqueeb> because the first option would be the clan
[1:30:19] <TonberryLives> BIG CHEATS YO
[1:30:20] <%Vigonept> CHEATS
[1:30:22] <GilliamYaeger> I presume the answer is the Oda clan
[1:30:25] <%robosqueeb> NO HONOR
[1:30:32] <shinryu1331> while your here dump your souls into orb
[1:30:34] <brunoberserk> BEAUTIFUL

[1:30:39] <%holydeviant1> @robosqueeb saving us all time, MAXIMUM HONOR
[1:30:41] <jimmytwofeet> Oh you dawg LUL
[1:30:49] <CappuccinoGuil> This was the first one
[1:30:55] <CappuccinoGuil> The 2nd was at the boss
[1:30:56] <pi_in_the_sci> this is the first one
[1:30:58] <brunoberserk> this is the first one
[1:31:02] <%robosqueeb> @holydeviant1 in light of this point I retract my statement LUL
[1:31:06] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Game Cheat you, you cheat game
[1:31:09] <+PyrokidSosa> @PyrokidSosa that's pretty interesting!
[1:31:18] <%SirGO0SE> those blue guys are the worst
[1:31:19] <+ar4ndomblackguy> The most laziest puzzles require the least amount of effort
[1:31:38] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Issatsu
[1:31:46] <%ShinobiPhoenix> or is it Onsen?
[1:31:55] <dds333a> Woolie running from this guy LUL
[1:31:59] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I just know I was good at it when I slashed something as theyh were coming at me
[1:32:02] <KUYAmoPESh> Roller got combos
[1:32:02] <brunoberserk> map button = P A N I C WutFace
[1:32:09] <pi_in_the_sci> the second one is by the first boss
[1:32:13] <%holydeviant1> Woolie shaking his fist at the soul stealers
[1:32:19] <shinryu1331> down the ladder
[1:32:20] <%robosqueeb> yes
[1:32:25] <shinryu1331> near boss
[1:32:28] <+The_Death_Owl> is this Resident Samurai May Cry?
[1:32:28] <+Arek_1> M A P . B U T T O N LUL
[1:32:38] <%SirGO0SE> @The_Death_Owl yes :)
[1:32:42] <%ShinobiPhoenix> last second slash tech was strong in this game
[1:32:57] <%SirGO0SE> only had 10
[1:32:58] <CappuccinoGuil> You can just hit them if they are at level
[1:33:13] <Asuterisuku> Resident Samurai
[1:33:15] <shinryu1331> i remember in later games the black necklace that auto issens every strike but it drains health
[1:33:30] <+Arek_1> How do you do the kick again?
[1:33:31] <shinryu1331> and the BS trading that u needed to do
[1:33:44] <%ShinobiPhoenix> what would a PS5/SeriesX Onimusha even look like?  Ghost of T with way more magic and corridors?
[1:33:53] <%SirGO0SE> :)
[1:33:58] <+xerotwo> LUL
[1:34:02] <%Afterman_> the gauntlet
[1:34:05] <%robosqueeb> you could answer this one partially at least, neat idea for a puzzle
[1:34:07] <CappuccinoGuil> Listen, we said you CAN go back to these later LUL
[1:34:30] <Sternieliscious> @ShinobiPhoenix Nioh, at times.
[1:34:31] <KeiPrime> back + attack while locking on is the kick
[1:34:34] <shinryu1331> @shinobiphoenix a mix of dmc and nioh...weapon switching and hack and slash but with some defensive tactics for dodging and parrying
[1:34:38] <tanarath> NO HONOUR
[1:34:56] <blackkanye> Man this makes me think of Kwaidan -Azure Manor Story-. Which is weird since I have played this. But I guess I don't need to think about this game since I'm watching it LUL
[1:35:02] <%Tarhish> There was some bs co-op in Onimusha Dawn of Dreams.  But it still had fixed camera, so P2 could literally be fighting offscreen
[1:35:03] <%holydeviant1> I love that the swords look cooler as you upgrade them
[1:35:10] <blackkanye> Yeah I upgraded things evenly too
[1:35:13] <%robosqueeb> man the next weapon is so fucking sick
[1:35:23] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I feel like Nioh is too fast versus Onimusha being more slow and delibrate
[1:35:24] <Asuterisuku> Orbs are keys. You want them levelled.
[1:35:29] <+Arek_1> @KeiPrime Ah, thanks.
[1:35:38] <CappuccinoGuil> @robosqueeb I don't like it, but its design is sick and the magic attack is super good
[1:35:38] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:35:41] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it is supposed to be Resident Evil with swords and demons
[1:35:46] <+patel347> did woolie find the green bean dude?
[1:35:50] <blackkanye> Oh yeah. That is why I prioritized orbs
[1:35:54] <fre3_reign> @patel347 yup
[1:36:10] <CappuccinoGuil> YEYEYEYEYE that's the true Onimusha experience LUL
[1:36:11] <blackkanye> Well there were other tank controls hack and slash action games
[1:36:12] <%paladinstarbuster> IS ONIMUSHA THE NEW LP? Pogchamp
[1:36:12] <+patel347> ah ok, had to leave for a bit, ill catch up later with the anime release I guess
[1:36:15] <blackkanye> like T.R.A.G.
[1:36:16] <KeiPrime> man games about samurais and ninjas fighting monsters are pretty cool
[1:36:16] <Asuterisuku> There is a shadow though, Reggie.
[1:36:16] <brunoberserk> oh man remember that awful onimusha fighting game that is a smash clone ??
[1:36:27] <+carmillatype> onimusha blade warriors
[1:36:40] <%robosqueeb> they multiply
[1:36:42] <+patel347> yeah thats right
[1:36:43] <+Fnir> you killed it
[1:36:46] <fruit_pie_the_magician> blade warriors sucked, but it was fun
[1:36:48] <CappuccinoGuil> They don't have any orbs, but they MULTIPLY orbs they absorb
[1:36:49] <%X2Eliah> sounds right
[1:36:52] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @brunoberserk The Devil is a lie, Blade Warriors was hot and Zero from Mega Man X was unlockable
[1:36:53] <dds333a> They absorb only from enemies, it seems
[1:36:56] <shinryu1331> @brunoberserk blade warriors did have some interesting stuff in it... like orbs and issen counters
[1:36:58] <+Arek_1> @WoolieVersus Yeah, you can kick by doing essentially High Time. Knocks down weaker enemies to allow for a finishing stab.
[1:37:22] <blackkanye> Can't you stab downed enemies?
[1:37:24] <%robosqueeb> blade warriors at least had that one megaman exe guy
[1:37:27] <CappuccinoGuil> Massive risk/reward: let them absorb everything for maximum gains, but risk them running away.
[1:37:30] <+patel347> yeah you can down stab
[1:37:55] <KeiPrime> easier to kill those absorb guys with the third weapon
[1:37:55] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Get Into Fighting Games: Onimusha: Blade Warriors
[1:38:00] <%robosqueeb> thats frampt, you have to feed him poops.
[1:38:02] <%BallerSwagBro9k> That's just Pat
[1:38:03] <dds333a> Gross
[1:38:04] <iacus_> feed him a knuckle sandwich
[1:38:10] <CappuccinoGuil> It's just green Pat
[1:38:12] <+Arek_1> @robosqueeb MegaMan. EXE and Zero from the MMZ series.
[1:38:14] <+xerotwo> PAT LUL
[1:38:14] <fre3_reign> @patel347 there he goes
[1:38:14] <+patel347> it is just pat LUL
[1:38:20] <shinryu1331> its upside down pat
[1:38:48] <%robosqueeb> anytime you mention tank controls he comes down from offscreen
[1:38:58] <+BappoTheMighty> omg it's onimusha
[1:38:58] <$Kaiser_Loar> are they playing in Japanese or English?
[1:38:59] <%robosqueeb> or the zapping system
[1:39:06] <KeiPrime> english
[1:39:10] <fre3_reign> English
[1:39:20] <dds333a> @kaiser_loar the latter
[1:39:23] <CappuccinoGuil> @Kaiser_Loar we only suffer here, so English LUL
[1:39:34] <shinryu1331> what is the zapping system...I've only seen the clip of woolie triggering pat about it
[1:39:45] <CappuccinoGuil> YO
[1:39:45] <$Kaiser_Loar> good old capcom 2000 dubs
[1:39:50] <TigerClaws12> OOS
[1:39:51] <Asuterisuku> Nice!
[1:39:58] <%robosqueeb> @shinryu1331 if you leave an item behind, other characters can later pick them up instead
[1:40:04] <CappuccinoGuil> Orb absorption has a combo system, BTW
[1:40:10] <%robosqueeb> i think at least
[1:40:23] <GilliamYaeger> @shinryu1331 It's the scenario system from Resident Evil 2 where doing stuff in one campaign changes stuff when you play the other character's campaign on the same save.
[1:40:23] <%ShinobiPhoenix> even the music is more Resident Evil
[1:40:24] <+BappoTheMighty> Who made Onimusha again? cause this feels capcom af
[1:40:28] <shinryu1331> @robosqueeb wait so nods steal items
[1:40:33] <shinryu1331> npcs
[1:40:34] <CappuccinoGuil> @BappoTheMighty capcom
[1:40:44] <+Arek_1> @shinryu1331 Doing one thing in a scenario will affect a later linked scenario.
[1:40:48] <%holydeviant1> Japanese castles were built for defense in wild ways
[1:40:49] <+BappoTheMighty> @CappuccinoGuil Awesome. Thank you friend.
[1:40:57] <%holydeviant1> Like, floors were made INTENTIONALLY creaky
[1:41:13] <%paladinstarbuster> onimusha is samurai RE
[1:41:17] <@Menitta> Yeah the nails in the floor thing is super cool
[1:41:20] <KeiPrime> i think this is flagship which is internal capcom sorta
[1:41:25] <shinryu1331> this is squid guys journal
[1:41:31] <+royscreen> I can't believe DMC1 is 20 years old. I feel like I should go buy some dentures and a walker now.
[1:41:39] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Onimusha and Resident Evil might as well be the same universe, but it would be closer if Onlmusha and Ghost N Goblins arer teh same universe
[1:41:42] <CappuccinoGuil> @shinryu1331 just left it in a random room for reasons LUL
[1:41:43] <$Kaiser_Loar> you could not quick change weapons on the ps2. you had to chang them in the menu
[1:41:45] <+Arek_1> "You're not Alexander!" LUL
[1:41:56] <+InvisiblessedReptile> Onimusha is so good
[1:41:58] <%SirGO0SE> its true, they do be sayin that
[1:42:00] <+Prevot> everyone is in bed with the demons huh
[1:42:16] <@Solidus_113> sometimes they turn into mechs too
[1:42:17] <%ShinobiPhoenix> "Even Lucifer has a copy of the bible, it just has more books in it'
[1:42:18] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Smart
[1:42:19] <iacus_> the nightingale floor
[1:42:20] <shinryu1331> @cappuccinoguil what's also weird is if u dont read the books u dont learn guildensterns name till oni 3
[1:42:46] <CappuccinoGuil> @shinryu1331 that's the name of the Berserk looking guy, right?
[1:42:46] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:42:53] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Is this Capcom btw
[1:42:55] <%ShinobiPhoenix> speaking of LOST games, there's no way to play Onlmusha 2 or 3 now
[1:42:59] <CappuccinoGuil> @BallerSwagBro9k yep
[1:43:01] <%holydeviant1> There;s tons of them, some castles had bad rafter 'floors', which would just straight up collapse, some had nails that were JUST too long in sensitive areas, etc etc
[1:43:11] <@Solidus_113> every time? every time
[1:43:17] <KeiPrime> is gogandantess in this one or 2
[1:43:18] <shinryu1331> @shinobiphoenix not even through emulation?
[1:43:22] <CappuccinoGuil> @ShinobiPhoenix whaaaaat? No PC port? That's craaaaaaaazy Kappa
[1:43:22] <PMda2nd> a bit
[1:43:34] <+Arek_1> @ShinobiPhoenix What do you mean? Disc rot?
[1:43:35] <%ShinobiPhoenix> or Dawn of Dreams
[1:43:37] <+patel347> use bow
[1:43:40] <+patel347> if you have it
[1:43:42] <CappuccinoGuil> Bow time?
[1:43:46] <%ShinobiPhoenix> no LEGAL way
[1:43:47] <shinryu1331> @cappuccinoguil ive never  seen berserk...but the liver guy
[1:43:48] <Asuterisuku> Out of ammo.
[1:43:48] <CzeekyTV> damn i love onimusha 3. i should emulate it again soon
[1:43:49] <+patel347> ah rip
[1:43:50] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Ok this series need to come back. Im super sold on it from what I've seen so far
[1:43:50] <%SirGO0SE> you have no arrows and they must die
[1:44:06] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Capcom hasn't re-released it ever
[1:44:09] <+patel347> rip
[1:44:10] <TigerClaws12> oops
[1:44:13] <%holydeviant1> And now we see why the demons are winning
[1:44:17] <+patel347> I love this room
[1:44:50] <%ShinobiPhoenix> now that we know companies lose and discard code for their old games, I wonder how many of these games not getting re-released is directly because of discarded code
[1:45:05] <shinryu1331> red guys power through your hits
[1:45:10] <CappuccinoGuil> Healing orbs have higher drop rates when your health is flashing
[1:45:20] <%holydeviant1> @ShinobiPhoenix probably a significant number. Whole ass library of alexandria's worth of code has been tossed
[1:45:27] <stormhawk9891> Healing orbs are guaranteed on Issen
[1:45:31] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I'd say its way more a result of them not giving a shit
[1:45:37] <dds333a> @shinobiphoenix many of us knew for years. now if only we knew which games specifically
[1:45:43] <%ShinobiPhoenix> all the DMCs ahve been re-released and continue to be, but no Onlmusha's but 1?  No Viewitful Joe?
[1:45:48] <shinryu1331> click the bow
[1:45:48] <+patel347> should be in your inventory somehwere
[1:45:58] <AzureHawk_Streams> Dammit, I'm late! How much did I miss?
[1:46:00] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I JUST SAW THAT JEAN RENO IS IN ONIMUSHA 3. WHAAAT LUL
[1:46:12] <shinryu1331> @azurehawk_streams ooh a liver...so basically everything
[1:46:13] <KeiPrime> onimusha 3 is a trip
[1:46:26] <shinryu1331> @ballerswagbro9k yep he does French voice too
[1:46:26] <Asuterisuku> They don't re-release Dino Crisis either.
[1:46:29] <CzeekyTV> @BallerSwagBro9k YEAH oni 3 is awwesome
[1:46:31] <%ThisIsLloyd> ThisIsLloyd subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! 
[1:46:31] <brunoberserk> Onimusha 3 : Jean Reno'S ZAPPING SYSTEM
[1:46:34] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @BallerSwagBro9k Yes, it was a big deal back then.  there's a whole episode of Unskippable about Onimusha 3
[1:46:38] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @BallerSwagBro9k  that was literally the only defining feature of that game aside from being worse than 2
[1:46:42] <CappuccinoGuil> @BallerSwagBro9k but they couldn't afford his voice likeness, so they dub him in English with a different guy LUL
[1:46:47] <%robosqueeb> ooh fire arrows
[1:47:17] <shinryu1331> @fruit_pie_the_magician oni3 is the best... oni 2 is the one that has only two new weapons (even though I like oni 2)
[1:47:20] <%ShinobiPhoenix> so since playing Dawn of Dreams is stupid legally now, why did people hate on it back then?  does the hate hold up now?
[1:47:23] <shinryu1331> oni 3 has snatch
[1:47:24] <%BallerSwagBro9k> They fight Nobunagas Demon Armies in Paris. I CANT BELIEVE THIS IS REAL
[1:47:25] <KeiPrime> he does voice his own lines in french which is like two scenes?
[1:47:29] <+Arek_1> I think that's the total amount of souls you've ever gained.
[1:47:37] <%paladinstarbuster> scmoovin
[1:47:39] <shinryu1331> @ballerswagbro9k in 2004!

[1:48:18] <%SirGO0SE> Kaede Kreygasm

[1:48:35] <fruit_pie_the_magician> the pre rendered shit in 2 is fucking amazing
[1:48:42] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I found Kaede to be the better fighter when I last played this

[2:03:00] <Th3rd3> now imagine Onimusha in RE engine TPFufun
[2:03:04] <+ar4ndomblackguy> i hope yall play oni 2. Its my fav out of the trilogy
[2:03:08] <KeiPrime> onimusha 2 is awesome
[2:03:09] <+vexion_smh> oni 3 is gooooooood
[2:03:10] <shinryu1331> can u watch it live
[2:03:13] <Blank9> there's a making of video that capcom put out that's on youtube too

[2:03:14] <%livlinn> So Woolie REALLY never touched RE huh
[2:03:17] <zanzibarian_hamster> It has that one french actor in it
[2:03:21] <+mexicandetective> @ar4ndomblackguy same
[2:03:22] <%CappuccinoGuil> And remember: There was never an Onimusha 3 on PC Kappa
[2:03:31] <Blank9> yeah 1 is fast and good, 2 is experimental and great, 3 is perfect
[2:03:31] <dds333a> I've heard that 3 is the pits
[2:03:32] <stardustno1r> yeah, pretty much
[2:03:32] <brunoberserk> yes , the gameplay evolves a lot
[2:03:34] <Teyaric> Oni3's intro was like, the HEIGHT of "FMV Hype" back in the day. It's an extreme example.
[2:03:36] <+vexion_smh> 3 is super fun tho
[2:03:38] <KeiPrime> oh yeah oni1 is pretty good but 2 and 3 just improve in it
[2:03:39] <shinryu1331> oni has weird creative direction
[2:03:40] <%CptnCampy61> That intro is the hottest shit to this day
[2:03:41] <+patel347> haha was the 3 port bad?

[2:03:57] <brunoberserk> JEAN RENO SAMURAI
[2:04:00] <%SirGO0SE> i only played the 1st but this LP might be a good a spring point to get the 2nd and 3rd running
[2:04:01] <KeiPrime> oh yeah that was the era of ubisoft capcom pc ports
[2:04:01] <pirateofpie> How is Dawn of Dreams, anyway?
[2:04:02] <+Mkingston> Onimusha 2 had a roadblock for me - Gogandantess

[2:04:19] <+mexicandetective> I love dawn of dreams
[2:04:20] <Blank9> dawn of dreams is ok, but weird
[2:04:22] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Oni 2 looks bonkers and jubei is better than samanosuke
[2:04:25] <zanzibarian_hamster> He has like 3 lines in the entire thing, it's really obvious when you notice it
[2:04:27] <Blank9> it's way more of an rpg
[2:04:27] <dds333a> Are they
[2:04:27] <+patel347> btw you can do an issen after a parry too
[2:04:38] <Sternieliscious> Want wacky hack and slash from the PS2 era? Eve of Extinction is worthy of riffing on. Your girlfriend is a lightsaber.

[2:05:21] <CalderGaming> it's a whip woolie
[2:05:23] <+Mkingston> I've owned Onimusha 3 for years. Never played it.
[2:05:24] <shinryu1331> whip
[2:05:25] <%CappuccinoGuil> Also, for those of you that didn't play it, YES, you have to do the lever and trapdoor puzzles again if you fail the water puzzle NotLikeThis
[2:05:26] <+Arek_1> Whip.
[2:05:30] <+ar4ndomblackguy> Jubei is fucking amazing
[2:05:38] <%BallerSwagBro9k> HE HAS NUNCHUKS? I HAVE TO PLAY THAT
[2:05:47] <shinryu1331> @mkingston play it for the hilarity of samonosuke in modern times
[2:05:50] <Blank9> reno has a whip and grapple mechanics
[2:05:52] <Blank9> he rules
[2:05:56] <shinryu1331> @ballerswagbro9k whip not nunchucks
[2:05:59] <%CappuccinoGuil> @BallerSwagBro9k he gets a whip first and then a sword whip. Don't remember the rest.
[2:06:10] <pirateofpie> Reggie stop hating

[2:06:22] <+valiard> ?
[2:06:25] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I grew up watching Jean Reno films so this is mind blowing to me lol
[2:06:29] <+Mkingston> @shinryu1331  I was playing through the trilogy but then Gorgandantess fight on the beach stopped me.
[2:06:40] <stormhawk9891> They get more demonic looking as you upgrade them too
[2:06:44] <prime_name> SC has some great weapon designs
[2:06:46] <Blank9> gotta learn your charged issens
[2:06:47] <brunoberserk> yes
[2:06:48] <shinryu1331> @mkingston the rigged fight?
[2:07:14] <+Mkingston> @shinryu1331  yeah, you have to survive for so long (I think) and I couldn't do it.
[2:07:34] <shinryu1331> @mkingston it's not surviclving u hit his shield until cutscene
[2:07:34] <Blank9> it's a shame samanosuke never got into crossover games because actor shenanigans
[2:07:38] <+valiard> Is this the playstation or xbox version?
[2:07:40] <shinryu1331> surviving
[2:07:48] <+carmillatype> I always think of those car commercials where jean reno played doraemon

[2:11:23] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Ngl the dub isnt half bad. RE1 was way worse
[2:11:24] <+Mkingston> I'd buy a car off him
[2:11:28] <%paladinstarbuster> in real life too
[2:11:34] <%X2Eliah> @Asuterisuku Eh it's like 10% at most
[2:11:44] <%X2Eliah> and there's such a thing as blood/brain barrier
[2:11:49] <shinryu1331> @ballerswagbro9k its worse in oni 2
[2:12:08] <Blank9> 2 has gogandantess though
[2:12:11] <Blank9> his dub is the best
[2:12:17] <Equirah> it's not that there's nothing in it, just nothing helpful
[2:12:21] <Teyaric> Oh, man. GOGANDANTES.
[2:12:31] <shinryu1331> @blank9 it also has ekei.  the worst
[2:12:35] <Asuterisuku> I feel like those are actual kanji in the JP release, why change them to glyphs overseas?
[2:12:41] <dds333a> Totally LUL
[2:12:58] <+Mkingston> Woolie needs Gogandantess
[2:12:59] <KeiPrime> folding screens are also for getting cut in half
[2:13:22] <shinryu1331> I dont wanna watch woolie try to figure out how to beat gogandantess
[2:13:25] <Blank9> this might be more of a classic survival horror game than re2make
[2:13:37] <Teyaric> Real talk - On the Top 10 Vergils of all time, where do we put Gogandantes?
[2:13:37] <dds333a> Dudes just flipping

[2:15:48] <%X2Eliah> yeah
[2:15:55] <%holydeviant1> Enhancing consumables is for when other stff is maxed
[2:15:55] <shinryu1331> u can do it later
[2:15:55] <dds333a> I wonder, too.
[2:16:04] <Asuterisuku> Enhancing items is... risky.

[2:16:43] <dds333a> Love that beginning angle
[2:16:48] <+patel347> lockon is really good for fights like this
[2:16:58] <+Mkingston> Where's Tarkus when you need him?
[2:16:59] <%AlteisenReiseZ> EVERY SAMURAI GAME NEEDS A FIGHT ON THE ROOF OF THE CASTLE. Bonus points if it's on fire.
[2:17:14] <shinryu1331> that's a nice looking watch this demon has
[2:17:16] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @alteisenreisez Facts
[2:17:25] <%Tearonex> All these dramatic camera cuts
[2:17:26] <%jinking79> Marcellus balance form
[2:17:27] <SuperFightinRobot> That is a Nelo Angelo if I have ever seen one
[2:17:28] <Blank9> even ninja games have it, tenchu 3 had basically this same exact roof in it's intro fight
[2:17:30] <Drunkengen> Yo is this batman ninja
[2:17:32] <+wunp_fxs> omfg
[2:17:36] <%holydeviant1> Camera!
[2:17:37] <+wunp_fxs> that camera
[2:17:42] <+Mkingston> The PS2 was perfect. What are you talking about?
[2:17:42] <dds333a> @alteisenreisez Ninja Scroll had one if I remember. I know it had a fight in a burning room, at lea
[2:17:42] <Asuterisuku> This camera practically requires tank controls.
[2:17:50] <%holydeviant1> yo i didn't know you could break the floor!
[2:17:52] <+royscreen> oh now it's Marcellus Wallace on the roof!
[2:17:58] <+Arek_1> Camerough.

[2:18:02] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Hell, Madworld had a pretty good one too.
[2:18:13] <shinryu1331> unload magic!!!
[2:18:19] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> The camera was the final boss of so many games of this early 3D era
[2:18:20] <GilliamYaeger> Use your magic!
[2:18:21] <+Standard_Enemy> Imagine if fixed cameras were how we saw things in real life
[2:18:21] <TigerClaws12> hell yea
[2:18:24] <%X2Eliah> jesus
[2:18:26] <%CappuccinoGuil> Fire magic, bro!
[2:18:31] <%X2Eliah> it does like 3 cuts in a row
[2:18:39] <shinryu1331> all magic
[2:18:41] <+yukichocomilk> the camera is so trash LUL
[2:18:44] <%Tearonex> It feels like I'm watching taken LUL
[2:18:47] <+Mkingston> Fight directed by Michael Bay
[2:18:55] <TigerClaws12> LUL
[2:19:04] <dds333a> @standard_enemy wouldn't even mind
[2:19:07] <Asuterisuku> Shield is gone
[2:19:07] <+carmillatype> let's get a shaky cam on this
[2:19:18] <Blank9> SUCC also doubles as a taunt to force enemies attack you, to make it faster to issen them
[2:19:19] <%X2Eliah> phase 2?
[2:19:26] <dds333a> Like that one bathroom fight in the Bourne movies
[2:19:33] <%CappuccinoGuil> yeyeyeyeye
[2:19:40] <+vexion_smh> ayyyyy
[2:19:40] <Asuterisuku> First try boys!
[2:19:42] <+mexicandetective> nice
[2:19:44] <GilliamYaeger> Good fight
[2:19:45] <TigerClaws12> that was some shit Oki, guy Keepo
[2:19:53] <%holydeviant1> wait don't fall i need to loot - oh
[2:19:53] <%X2Eliah> oh it was dolph lundgren!
[2:19:54] <shinryu1331> new weapon!!!
[2:19:59] <Asuterisuku> STORM
[2:20:01] <taro_m> Where Jean Reno though :D
[2:20:03] <KingOfTheGeats> I love this weapon
[2:20:03] <dds333a> Storme
[2:20:07] <TigerClaws12> weeb up
[2:20:11] <%X2Eliah> what
[2:20:14] <KeiPrime> darth maul it up
[2:20:14] <JetpackMcQuack> PogChamp sure
[2:20:17] <Blank9> I was too into fire for big damage
[2:20:24] <%X2Eliah> that is nithing like the enemy's sword
[2:20:25] <+Mkingston> best weapon in 1&2 for me
[2:20:29] <jetstreamlove_R> classic re cameras position mixed whit dmc action style.
[2:20:30] <dds333a> Twister in the house
[2:20:48] <shinryu1331> bitches
[2:20:50] <jetstreamlove_R> yes i'm aware this came before dmc!
[2:20:52] <%CappuccinoGuil> @X2Eliah it's not the weapon, it's the orb, it takes shape differently for people.
[2:20:53] <dds333a> Before it, in fact
[2:21:22] <taro_m> Is Onimusha another one of those Resident Evil 4 prototypes, like DMC was?
[2:21:22] <+Mkingston> This weapon at top level though
[2:21:37] <+Mkingston> @taro_m  I think so
[2:21:44] <dds333a> Why is wind in games green, anyway
[2:21:55] <Blank9> no, onimusha was actually a ps1 resident evil game initially
[2:22:00] <%CappuccinoGuil> @dds333a green can be a refreshing color
[2:22:01] <taro_m> @dds333a leaves on the wind
[2:22:01] <Asuterisuku> Because it blows leaves around?
[2:22:08] <jetstreamlove_R> camera gives it a classic feel but it just doesn't work for an action focused game
[2:22:10] <GilliamYaeger> @dds333a Because red is fire, blue is water, yellow is lightning. Green is the last primary color left unused.
[2:22:14] <shinryu1331> wind power is green energy
[2:22:16] <%CappuccinoGuil> @taro_m was about to say, that too
[2:22:21] <GilliamYaeger> Also the color of leaves blowing in the wind
[2:22:24] <%X2Eliah> @dds333a Because blue is taken by water
[2:22:26] <taro_m> Now punch that child
[2:22:27] <Blank9> it did inspire DMC1 specifically because one of the bugs in Onimusha's testing was enemy juggles that they then added intentionally to DMC1 for air combos
[2:22:33] <%Tearonex> You're safe with my big dumb hand

[2:22:50] <Asuterisuku> Onee-chan
[2:22:51] <+Prevot> green and purple are the two colors that can be anything
[2:22:55] <%CappuccinoGuil> That makes no fucking sense

[2:23:37] <PinoProxie> YURTS
[2:23:38] <+carmillatype> funny that people still claim games aren't art when this game came out in 2001
[2:23:38] <%CappuccinoGuil> So is Samanosuke reverse-weeaboo?
[2:23:38] <KUYAmoPESh> lol Makes no sense at all
[2:23:40] <OldManDeckardCain> he can only manage it for 1 sec for no, but sooon...

[2:24:59] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[2:25:13] <+Mkingston> yes, Pat
[2:25:13] <shinryu1331> @blank9 mitsuhide shows up in oni 3
[2:25:13] <+Prevot> must be a modern day Japanese man isekai'd
[2:25:14] <Asuterisuku> @pirateofpie He isn't boiled though.
[2:25:17] <+Arek_1> LUL
[2:25:19] <%BallerSwagBro9k> PAT
[2:25:20] <shinryu1331> but samonosuke does the work
[2:25:24] <bonebagMEL> Just got here, he's not using tank controls right?
[2:25:27] <pirateofpie> @Asuterisuku That's true
[2:25:33] <%CappuccinoGuil> @bonebagMEL nope
[2:25:34] <jetstreamlove_R> Nobunaga was the more progressive guy despite being a ruthless conqueror
[2:25:48] <dds333a> Yep, Tom Cruise
[2:25:48] <%jepupu> Looking at this game, I'm just getting more confused why people disliked Dawn of Dreams.
[2:25:49] <shinryu1331> william comes later....this is nioh 2
[2:25:50] <+Mkingston> I'm currently wearing the Hollow Knight CSB shirt.

[2:26:06] <TigerClaws12> with the whole ranmaru thing
[2:26:07] <KeiPrime> yeah william is when tokugawa is in power?
[2:26:20] <brunoberserk> EVIL GIGER DOOR
[2:26:22] <shinryu1331> william is tokugawa vs ishida
[2:26:30] <Asuterisuku> Not heavy enough to make the big guys stagger.
[2:26:32] <shinryu1331> and nioh 2 is nobunaga up to hideyoshi
[2:26:43] <jetstreamlove_R> that whirlwind aoe is really good
[2:27:09] <%X2Eliah> Man, imagine a game set in the nobunaga time that has *all* the storylines of other games set around nobunaga going on in the background
[2:27:15] <%X2Eliah> A big shared nobunaga metaverse
[2:27:27] <Blank9> including pokemon conquest?
[2:27:28] <+Prevot> so when did this franchise die?
[2:27:36] <KeiPrime> if it were koei tecmo yeah the shared nobunga-verse is plausible
[2:27:36] <pirateofpie> Their grabs suck
[2:27:37] <Asuterisuku> Add anime into the list. Nobunagun is cannon.
[2:27:38] <%thesw1tch> the tech
[2:27:42] <Blank9> died at Dawn of Dreams
[2:27:48] <KeiPrime> this franchise died with dawn of dreams? so like 06?
[2:27:52] <%CappuccinoGuil> @Prevot 2004ish
[2:27:52] <shinryu1331> @x2eliah all the games have different views of nobunaga and the history...nioh probably has the most kind depiction of nobunaga
[2:28:09] <shinryu1331> whereas in oni nobunaga drinks blood and shit
[2:28:09] <+Prevot> wow didn't last long huh
[2:28:20] <%CappuccinoGuil> @Prevot it had 3 games
[2:28:21] <+Arek_1> I lost the name of the guy. I think people didn't like Dawn of Dreams 'cause of its more anime theme.
[2:28:26] <%X2Eliah> @Prevot that soon? this one is from 01
[2:28:28] <bonebagMEL> @shinryu1331 Yep, In Nioh Nobunaga was legit portrayed as the coolest guy
[2:28:37] <fruit_pie_the_magician> also oni 2 is like 3 times as long
[2:28:38] <@Menitta> Nioh's nobunaga is the coolest guy
[2:28:42] <brunoberserk> LOOKS IS PAT
[2:28:50] <KeiPrime> yasuke even shows up in both niohs
[2:29:10] <shinryu1331> in nioh there are no "bad guys " or good guys just misguided warlords who are all bad
[2:29:20] <TigerClaws12> @Menitta "Cooles Guy" huh Kappa
[2:29:20] <%CappuccinoGuil> Isn't there something important in the room the boy was in?
[2:29:34] <Asuterisuku> Good thing you saved.
[2:29:40] <+patel347> is green bean activated now?
[2:29:42] <TigerClaws12> yo nice health
[2:29:45] <+patel347> cant remember
[2:29:48] <%X2Eliah> rip
[2:29:57] <bonebagMEL> this isn't DMC... yet
[2:30:02] <Asuterisuku> Health Spray: Used.
[2:30:07] <%X2Eliah> tbh best use of a full heal
[2:30:08] <Killhooligan> magic can counterhit right?
[2:30:09] <%CappuccinoGuil> Hey, nice health, mind if I take it?
[2:30:09] <TigerClaws12> run back
[2:30:13] <fruit_pie_the_magician> i like to counter little dudes and make it hit big guys
[2:30:19] <TigerClaws12> *the run back
[2:30:23] <Asuterisuku> Shippuu is really good.
[2:30:31] <pirateofpie> @bonebagMEL Which game does it become DMC ?
[2:30:33] <jetstreamlove_R> got that royal guard release going!
[2:30:45] <+patel347> @pirateofpie green pat makes it dmc
[2:30:53] <%X2Eliah> gun trick sword guntrickgunsword
[2:30:58] <%jinking79> Ranmaru know well enough how Good Nob is
[2:30:59] <jetstreamlove_R> woolie saw the frame data and took it!
[2:31:00] <TigerClaws12> which one has multiple issen?
[2:31:08] <KeiPrime> blanka ball
[2:31:10] <SuperFightinRobot> Royal Guard!
[2:31:10] <stormhawk9891> @WoolieVersus It's easier to Issen the rolling attack
[2:31:19] <pirateofpie> @patel347 Ahhh, I get what you mean lol
[2:32:14] <Asuterisuku> I think enemies are colour coded based on what weapon you should be using but I could be wrong about that.
[2:32:14] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:32:21] <jetstreamlove_R> They should bring back environmental puzzles into modern gaming. Old RE style games understood that

[3:07:03] <KeiPrime> do the flip
[3:07:07] <dds333a> So, going by the RE eventual influence, she has a "gun" then?
[3:07:16] <dds333a> heavy air quotes, by the way
[3:07:30] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I wish I could play it in Japanese because the english is a little fucked
[3:07:34] <+patel347> her issen is super difficult
[3:07:35] <Asuterisuku> Reminder that Kappas suck out peoples souls through their butts.
[3:07:47] <AthenaAegis> @CptnCampy61 Just came back in. What yokai? You talkin bout the one with an eye in its butthole? Kappa
[3:07:47] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts

[3:07:49] <%holydeviant1> Just to spite you
[3:07:49] <+Arek_1> Oh, I thought Kaede's kick was the Rock Lee launcher kick.
[3:07:49] <brunoberserk> NOPE
[3:07:51] <%X2Eliah> wow
[3:07:52] <+megaman_sentinel> you can do stuff LOL
[3:08:14] <+neoexogene> @asuterisuku like the headless demons in Sekiro, their grab is just shoving a hand up your ass to pull out the soul
[3:08:18] <cinless> this is making me want to play kunimitsu
[3:08:22] <%holydeviant1> Hahahaha every time
[3:08:22] <+mexicandetective> I love her neck slice move
[3:08:31] <+pupil31> SourPls
[3:08:36] <jetstreamlove_R> fun moves yet game says, what you doing? NO EXP!
[3:08:50] <fruit_pie_the_magician> The Hajiji issen is easier, you just time it after a block. way less potentially costly
[3:09:00] <fruit_pie_the_magician> hajiki issen i mean
[3:09:07] <%X2Eliah> you have a red key
[3:09:11] <+kiiingdorr> Oh. I think I remember how this segment ends.
[3:09:34] <Asuterisuku> Woolie vs. Maps
[3:09:38] <jetstreamlove_R> this game turns into cheese mode once you learn how to perfect parry everything
[3:09:38] <Killhooligan> west prison in the plaza
[3:09:54] <seriousink> curious if woolie will ever figure out her gimmick
[3:10:24] <+neoexogene> @jetstreamlover_ryocan even more so in Oni 2 and 3 where you chain issen
[3:10:34] <%alpharius88> so how its sakura (naruto)?
[3:10:57] <dds333a> Taki who LUL
[3:10:57] <+megaman_sentinel> lock on
[3:11:00] <%X2Eliah> better than sakura (boruto)
[3:11:22] <cinless> gun?
[3:11:32] <KeiPrime> whats to run? action? forward and action while locking?
[3:11:35] <jetjagger222> wow the bgm is super dramatic for this section
[3:11:55] <%CappuccinoGuil> It must be enemy specific, right?
[3:12:01] <%X2Eliah> a game from2001 has achievements? cool!
[3:12:01] <dds333a> @cinless apparently there's a bowgun that can be acquired later
[3:12:23] <Killhooligan> you can get a rifle
[3:12:27] <%CappuccinoGuil> @dds333a there's a bow AND a gun
[3:12:33] <dds333a> I've never played this, so I was just going off by what chat said
[3:12:38] <cinless> i was about to say something about ancient japanese guns, but actually yeah they did have those
[3:12:43] <+mexicandetective> I think it's down up and attack or something similar with lock on
[3:12:48] <KeiPrime> yeah matchlock rifles are a thing
[3:12:52] <dds333a> @cappuccinoguil gotcha, thanks
[3:12:59] <seriousink> nobunaga famously loved guns
[3:13:07] <+neoexogene> Matchlock rifles are so cool
[3:13:14] <dds333a> @killhooligan Also thanks
[3:13:19] <jetjagger222> anyone saw kagemusha
[3:13:39] <+megaman_sentinel> just go
[3:13:50] <+neoexogene> @seriousink and wielded double sawed-off shotguns according to Devil Kings/Sengoku Basara
[3:13:51] <Asuterisuku> Stopping to fight everything when fights have no benefit.
[3:13:53] <+xerotwo> O W
[3:13:55] <dds333a> Like the cloud, Like the Wind and golden kamuy jad their fair share of guns too, although the former took place decades before the latter
[3:13:57] <+carmillatype> just do issen
[3:14:12] <%paladinstarbuster> shes a normal person with np super gauntlets
[3:14:13] <Sternieliscious> I'm getting flashbacks to The Girl sections in Chaos Legion.
[3:14:28] <Killhooligan> kaede gets a demon knife I think
[3:14:40] <Asuterisuku> And so that guy was killed by the archers.
[3:14:41] <KeiPrime> towards enemy and x while locked on
[3:15:04] <Asuterisuku> Iframes.

[3:16:04] <%CptnCampy61> CptnCampy61 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! 
[3:16:26] <jetjagger222> also don't the treasure chests look very similar to the ones from ninja gaiden
[3:17:23] <funwashere> I wonder, does Onimusha have a speedrunning scene?
[3:17:34] <+Prevot> you know with there being no benefit to killing enemies this basically becomes RE, just run past everything
[3:17:48] <Senor_Monty> yooo onimusha so lit
[3:17:49] <verscoll> tree tech
[3:18:02] <+athuramn> tree physics on point
[3:18:08] <+captain_history> 2001 tree tech
[3:18:12] <+croxeye> on the left
[3:18:18] <Asuterisuku> Oh no he found a thing in one of them and now he has to check ALL of them.
[3:18:23] <%CappuccinoGuil> it's just for funsies
[3:18:41] <brunoberserk> CHEAT TIME
[3:19:19] <dds333a> Reggie looking for ANY REASON
[3:19:21] <%BallerSwagBro9k> IS SHE SAKURA?
[3:19:23] <AnacondaVirtue> USELESS
[3:19:25] <Blank9> kaede rules you get good at the jumps and she does throat cuts
[3:19:35] <Asuterisuku> At least Sakura does heals.
[3:19:36] <AthenaAegis> Kaede is Onimusha's Ada Wong Kappa
[3:19:38] <s1rcuit> tbf a stealth build isn't that useful against a demon invasion
[3:19:48] <rekinom> She does have that absolute territory going on though
[3:19:49] <%paladinstarbuster> shes just a normal ninja girl in orange
[3:19:51] <KeiPrime> thigh tattoo tho
[3:20:00] <prime_name> Atleast she isn't Natsu
[3:20:01] <brunoberserk> at least the girls in onimusha 2 and 3 are cool
[3:20:07] <LoreKeeper_Thal> she gotta compete with Ayame from TEnch who's WAY COOLER
[3:20:14] <LoreKeeper_Thal> Tenchu*
[3:20:18] <jetjagger222> yeah ayame got the sass
[3:20:28] <dds333a> @prime_name thank GOD she isn't
[3:20:38] <+captain_history> i think the whole point in Onimusha 1 is that everyone would be kind of fucked without the oni gauntlet being a thing
[3:20:48] <dds333a> SoulCal thankfully has cooled it with the ninjas
[3:21:20] <cinless> soulcal's still got two ninjas
[3:21:44] <KeiPrime> yeah taki, yoshimitsu, and NO OTHEr Ninjas

[3:27:35] <%thetunnelhomer> Wait. Is this Ninja resident evil?
[3:27:40] <dds333a> @thetunnelhomer to be honest, it's Onimusha, although I've never played it myself. it's a Capcom PS2 game
[3:27:42] <+dustiler> Nah ill jump in neutral
[3:27:44] <shinryu1331> has he learned kaede is useless yet?
[3:27:49] <+dustiler> There aint no anti air

[3:28:14] <dds333a> @thetunnelhomer and yes, apparently you're more right tha you know
[3:28:14] <+Prevot> getting turned around in a corridor
[3:28:40] <dellis80> doesn't the difficulty spike hard towards the end of this game?
[3:28:44] <jetjagger222> ancient japanese elevator
[3:28:50] <shinryu1331> did woolie dash into the fire yet?
[3:29:05] <dds333a> Especially since a lot of RE games are ABOUT getting the fuck out of a bad situation
[3:29:14] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I can't speak for this game but I never found Oni 2 to be hard, even on hard mode

[3:30:26] <Hammatime8> She finally looks kinda cool!
[3:30:28] <%CappuccinoGuil> BECAUSE SHE'S ALREADY STRONG
[3:30:37] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I'd be big pissed if it was weaker
[3:30:50] <+Prevot> samanosuke without the gauntlet was even weaker than her
[3:30:52] <Indigo_Automaton> Demons be like: "Ew Cooties"
[3:30:58] <cinless> yeah sam is just a loser who needs the extra help
[3:31:07] <+patel347> she just good enough on her own
[3:31:09] <+shoryukenabotch> Sexist Oni
[3:31:10] <DatAsuna> She's the only one of them who has demon kills without being carried

[3:31:33] <shinryu1331> samonosuke jobbed to a boss though
[3:31:38] <+patel347> I completely forgot about the gun segments in 3
[3:31:45] <jetjagger222> sam is nowhere near as cool as jean reno
[3:31:51] <shinryu1331> @patel347 theres also guns in oni 2
[3:31:57] <+captain_history> samanosuke is cool in 3
[3:31:59] <+patel347> yeah but thats more like a rifle
[3:32:01] <%illicitdonut> Ahh, yes! Samurai Resident Evil!
[3:32:06] <+dustiler> RUSHDOWN
[3:32:07] <+patel347> not an assault rifle
[3:32:14] <Sternieliscious> Fear the gate!
[3:32:21] <fruit_pie_the_magician> French Jean Reno was cool. But then they dubbed him and he became some lame normal sounding dude

[3:45:11] <pirateofpie> Save first
[3:45:12] <CalderGaming> Bloody Palace woooo
[3:45:12] <%CappuccinoGuil> NO
[3:45:14] <drunken_lemur> Work that thing like a speed bag.
[3:45:15] <%holydeviant1> bLOODY mINI pALACE
[3:45:26] <stardustno1r> You can do it
[3:45:26] <shinryu1331> best weapon in the game if u do this
[3:45:26] <armchairmaster_> N o
[3:45:32] <Applecannon63> Pat?
[3:45:34] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> It's how you unlock the ultimate weapon
[3:45:36] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Hi Pat
[3:45:38] <+picante_papi> It's easy, just make sure you've got parrying down
[3:45:39] <+Captbutt> it gives you stuff, doesn't it?
[3:45:45] <PlanetNixia> And the amazing 'Gale' theme that plays during it
[3:45:46] <stardustno1r> It's worth it tbh
[3:45:51] <Sonny_Firestorm> Gauntlet Lv1 and 2 are so ugly compared to Lv3.
[3:45:53] <%CappuccinoGuil> @shinryu1331 what did the gauntlet upgrade do?
[3:45:57] <+snausages_> the music is different tho isnt it
[3:45:58] <pi_in_the_sci> switch you weapons to suck up all the magic
[3:45:58] <brunoberserk> @WoolieVersus  dark realm is basically the bloody palace , if you finish you get the best weapon in the game
[3:46:00] <jetstreamlove_R> so close
[3:46:02] <+picante_papi> @Captbutt Yes
[3:46:08] <%holydeviant1> @CappuccinoGuil more souls more succ
[3:46:10] <shinryu1331> @cappuccinoguil I think it improves the speed of absorption
[3:46:19] <+picante_papi> Gives you better succ power
[3:46:20] <%CappuccinoGuil> oh alright then
[3:46:20] <Asuterisuku> Bloody Palace time?
[3:46:24] <shinryu1331> or the range
[3:46:38] <Sonny_Firestorm> @CappuccinoGuil Strengthens soul sucking, making it faster and at lv3 it destabilizes those suck-sucking Genma.
[3:47:05] <shinryu1331> in later games the gauntlet becomes it's own item to manually upgrade same as the weapons
[3:47:07] <jetstreamlove_R> better suck should just been from the beginning
[3:47:31] <thatpurplefunk> this music is pretty creepy
[3:47:36] <cinless> how's the battery life on those headphones?
[3:47:54] <%CappuccinoGuil> Past that demon door it's the end
[3:48:01] <shinryu1331> before we go can we see reggie react to the oni 3 intro?
[3:48:07] <Sonny_Firestorm> Nah, because Lv3 Gauntlet comes with the rather busted ability to pull the Soul-sucking Orbs towards you.
[3:48:25] <brunoberserk> this game is kinda short compared to the other onimusha games
[3:48:35] <pirateofpie> Yeah
[3:48:38] <shinryu1331> every level u get an xit
[3:48:42] <brunoberserk> yes
[3:48:47] <Sonny_Firestorm> Yeah, "bloody palace" is a part of the game in Onimusha.
[3:48:53] <Sonny_Firestorm> It's not a separate mode.
[3:48:54] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Just get to level 20 to unlock the weapon
[3:49:18] <Sonny_Firestorm> Outro Time?
[3:49:21] <arkv01> SQUEEEEZE
[3:49:27] <StarlitStunner> Gotta get the pulp
