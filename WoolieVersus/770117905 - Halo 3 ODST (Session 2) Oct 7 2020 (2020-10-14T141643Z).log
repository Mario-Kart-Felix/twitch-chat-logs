[0:16:42] <%Dean_Inbetween> 2 might be necessary
[0:16:42] <brachydios777> ARES!
[0:16:49] <%Dean_Inbetween> for infinite
[0:16:55] <%TheEpicTree> MY FAMILY!!!
[0:16:56] <Minerslovegames> Would Woolie enjoy Halo Wars?
[0:17:03] <Nomad94> I was SO bad at Wars
[0:17:08] <%Dean_Inbetween> Uh i know he played star craft
[0:17:11] <+BigBlackBankai> Has Woolie played rts before?
[0:17:15] <DemonicHoward> i had to co-op wars to get through it
[0:17:17] <%Dean_Inbetween> Yes i think
[0:17:18] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> everything is quiet lol
[0:17:30] <%Dean_Inbetween> Woolie has played rts before
[0:17:35] <DemonicHoward> i think woolie would enjoy the story of wars
[0:17:37] <andrewofbob> I don’t think he’s done RTS, but it’s a controller RTS, so free backdown
[0:17:38] <Minerslovegames> He talked about Age Of Empires on the podcast a bit, so maybe. Would be cool to see him try to strategize.
[0:17:39] <DemonicHoward> and the cutscenes
[0:17:50] <%krispen_wa> *sad piano noises*

[0:17:59] <%Dean_Inbetween> Woolie has mentioned he’s played rts before in the past

[0:18:19] <Minerslovegames> Halo Wars 2 cutscenes were done by the same people who did the Halo 2 Anniversary cutscenes, and it SHOWS.
[0:18:28] <+CezrDaPleazr> Hey Woolie, how are you doing?
[0:18:30] <%krispen_wa> ahh, outer wilds, the game about space capitalism
[0:18:31] <%Dean_Inbetween> Like star craft he also just mentioned an old shitty one he got a free video card with when he was little
[0:18:31] <digitalslime> sad whale song
[0:18:32] <DemonicHoward> didnt they also do wars 1
[0:18:36] <+JeluxDaCasual> Here comes VISR MODE ON
[0:18:49] <%Javaa01> Wrong checkpoint
[0:18:53] <razieltano123> @Minerslovegames Dude! The Ark is godlike.
[0:18:53] <%Dean_Inbetween> Halo wars 2 is legitimately a good rts
[0:18:59] <brachydios777> Visr only at night please
[0:19:01] <%Dean_Inbetween> 1 is mediocre
[0:19:01] <%Cerberus_NV> monkaS

[0:21:00] <%Livelinne> it sucks that twitch app don't show hype train lytWIPED
[0:21:01] <+condemned_15> do not use Visr at day
[0:21:01] <+JeluxDaCasual> and it never turned off again
[0:21:05] <Dean_Inbetween> Also i think playing 2 adds to infinites story
[0:21:06] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> so much rain could barely see the road
[0:21:12] <PhazonSuited> @krispen_wa vineStank
[0:21:15] <%Sgt_Rorschach> They’ve fixed the Audio Log crash I believe
[0:21:17] <%marrs_bars> jump, coward! SMOrc
[0:21:19] <%Sgt_Rorschach> Hades is badass
[0:21:19] <%Dean_Inbetween> So it would be good for woolie to at least check out 2
[0:21:31] <%doomerskeletor13> Woolie dont blind yourself with the visr
[0:21:32] <+condemned_15> LUL

[0:22:08] <MajoraZ> @chainsaw105 it actuially does, at the start of the game when you first wake up it rains, but it's pretty hard to see
[0:22:10] <%doomerskeletor13> Lmao
[0:22:10] <+condemned_15> errybody fuckin

[0:22:35] <@Menitta> Athena too?
[0:22:36] <+BigBlackBankai> Because MAHVEL BAYBE
[0:22:37] <%krispen_wa> HADES WAS COOL THO
[0:22:40] <TGIAbeybaby> Poseidon gang where you at
[0:22:44] <omicronalpharius> Hades himself was actually pretty alright.
[0:22:47] <T_Sasquatch> Actually the Gods just rape
[0:22:49] <%Dean_Inbetween> No wonder kratos kills them all
[0:22:50] <omicronalpharius> Zeus is the absolutel fucking worst
[0:22:51] <DianaTheAscian> @Menitta she turned a girl into a spider
[0:22:52] <+wunp_fxs> LUL haha Posiden is just as bad
[0:22:52] <@Solidus_113> demis
[0:22:53] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Thats not how it goes
[0:22:54] <%doomerskeletor13> Kratos is right, fuck the Gods
[0:22:57] <%Sgt_Rorschach> Hades kidnapped that one woman that one time tho
[0:22:59] <+condemned_15> Zeus on FurAffinity right now
[0:23:01] <SpartanSeventyEight> Woah! Don't compare zeus to furries, that's not fair to furries.
[0:23:07] <andrewofbob> SMT Charon is just a fed-up jobber who takes bribes
[0:23:08] <+ZacharyWile> He loves screwing people as bull in particular.
[0:23:11] <razieltano123> Kratos did nothing wrong.

[0:23:18] <+A_Real_American_Trash_Can> Furries, not to be confused with the Furies.
[0:23:18] <%krispen_wa> uhhh...did hephaestus do anything wrong?
[0:23:22] <@Menitta> @DianaTheAscian what why tho
[0:23:24] <TGIAbeybaby> BOY
[0:23:25] <+BigBlackBankai> Hermes was a troll god, so he is just doing his job.
[0:23:25] <Manjove> Furries WISH they could do what Zeus can do.
[0:23:26] <%Dean_Inbetween> Hades is the only one who minded his own business and had any sense of restraint considering his job was judging people
[0:23:30] <+metzselaar> Also rain once
[0:23:30] <+yhom_tork> halo physics are so good LuL
[0:23:32] <+Kqha4000> Big cosmic night mommy
[0:23:32] <ColbyBryant> Hephaestus is chill
[0:23:32] <%doomerskeletor13> Loki never raped anyone, Loki > Zeus
[0:23:36] <%Sgt_Rorschach> #MedusaDidNothingWrong
[0:23:40] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Uh, what?
[0:23:54] <TGIAbeybaby> @sgt_rorschach she was just too hot
[0:23:54] <omicronalpharius> @krispen_wa kinda? he did the ancient greek version of revenge porn kinda (since his wife cheated on him and he revealed it publicly humiliating her en flagrante)
[0:24:00] <DianaTheAscian> @Menitta the girl lost a sewing competition to her
[0:24:05] <chainsaw105> you could theoretically go to any mission in any order but the story gets kinda jumbled if you do that
[0:24:06] <+ZacharyWile> @CanadianAnimatorGuy What do you mean, what?
[0:24:11] <%Sgt_Rorschach> Didn’t Loki trick a regular animal into fucking him tho
[0:24:13] <%D00msDayDan> @ZacharyWile floating security things
[0:24:19] <razieltano123> @doomerskeletor13 Rape no. But he was a manwhore of all of Midgard.
[0:24:21] <%Javaa01> @doomerskeletor13 He didn't fuck anyone without consent, he just fucked with people without consent
[0:24:21] <Manjove> Loki fucked a Horse
[0:24:22] <Minerslovegames> Most of Greek mythology can be summed up as "one day Zeus got horny, then some poor girl minding her own business got pregnant."
[0:24:26] <Manjove> well,
[0:24:28] <jorniev> HEY ITS V
[0:24:31] <%Sgt_Rorschach> Yeah. Loki’s a furry
[0:24:33] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> You can't just pick missions in any order, there's a set sequence
[0:24:34] <Manjove> Loki got fucked by a horse
[0:24:34] <CappuccinoGuil> @Sgt_Rorschach define "trick"
[0:24:37] <@Menitta> jesus
[0:24:40] <+novacrusader727> Rally point best map
[0:24:44] <%doomerskeletor13> @sgt_rorschach He shape shifted into a horse to lure away another horse and then that horse subsequently had sex with him yeah
[0:24:50] <%Sgt_Rorschach> @cappuccinoguil turn into a different species
[0:24:50] <dreadedcthulhu> boy I hope we get to see some rounds of firefight
[0:24:55] <TGIAbeybaby> Zeus’s golden shower
[0:24:56] <%krispen_wa> who did zeus fuck consensually other than hera?
[0:25:02] <DianaTheAscian> didn't zeus eat his first wife?
[0:25:06] <%doomerskeletor13> Not many people
[0:25:13] <%Sgt_Rorschach> No that was Zeus’ dad
[0:25:15] <%Dean_Inbetween> Loki is looked down upon in that mythology because he was feminine and pretty and didn’t have traditional traits of manliness
[0:25:15] <ColbyBryant> Loki murdered Baldr as a prank
[0:25:17] <CappuccinoGuil> @Sgt_Rorschach you can hardly trick an animal like that, all he did was turn into a horse and shake his ass LUL
[0:25:26] <torres_kun> Eat or eat out his wife?
[0:25:27] <+condemned_15> just walk away
[0:25:27] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> That's Vergil talking
[0:25:30] <%krispen_wa> no, zeus's dad ate his sons...as portrayed by that one painting
[0:25:30] <andrewofbob> Greek mythology has a lot of vore...
[0:25:31] <Minerslovegames> Then the poor girls Zeus got pregnant were shamed by Hera even though it wasn't their fault.
[0:25:31] <%Dean_Inbetween> Hence hes the bad guy according to them
[0:25:34] <Yummy_Nukes> you could just sneak past em if you just stay in the shadoes Kappa
[0:25:37] <Minerslovegames> It's super fucked up, really.
[0:25:40] <TGIAbeybaby> @cappuccinoguil thank you that image is now burned into my mind
[0:25:44] <DianaTheAscian> i thought Zeus tricked his wife to be a bug and he became a bird and ate her
[0:25:44] <%Sgt_Rorschach> Tap the button
[0:25:47] <%Sgt_Rorschach> No crash
[0:25:51] <%Sgt_Rorschach> No audio plays
[0:25:54] <Halospaz117> well collect them at least
[0:25:55] <CappuccinoGuil> @TGIAbeybaby all in a day's work
[0:25:56] <+ygernesfeld> ???
[0:25:58] <+ZacharyWile> @krispen_wa I think Dionysus mother, who he then unfortunately burnt to a crisp by showing her his true form.
[0:26:17] <%alpacasintophats> the audio logs should work whether you tap it or just play it
[0:26:19] <%krispen_wa> @zacharywile what a fucking hero
[0:26:29] <%doomerskeletor13> Man I hope Atreus doesn’t shape shift into a horse brownS brownS brownS
[0:26:30] <%alpacasintophats> shouldn't crash anymore
[0:26:32] <%D00msDayDan> if you tap instead of hold you can still pick them up without playing them
[0:26:36] <%Sgt_Rorschach> ^
[0:26:37] <%emperordread> Use gun on aliens
[0:26:39] <Nomad94> Someone pick up the phone
[0:26:41] <Decimated_body> Better safe than sorry
[0:26:55] <TGIAbeybaby> He can’t pick up the phone guys. It’s the IRS
[0:27:00] <%Sgt_Rorschach> Crash got fixed, that was a Day 1 thing iirc
[0:27:03] <CappuccinoGuil> Don't pickup the phone, it's Jennifer White from Phasmophobia
[0:27:03] <%Dean_Inbetween> Lol
[0:27:05] <+BigBlackBankai> Changes sumting else too
[0:27:06] <Nomad94> oh no, the IRS? they here for yoshi
[0:27:06] <%Javaa01> Considering the reset is like 10 minutes if a crash happens, yeah it's better to just play it safe
[0:27:11] <brachydios777> I just hope we get to watch the side story in the stream
[0:27:14] <%Dean_Inbetween> The SPACE irs
[0:27:17] <%Javaa01> Not even counting redoing the checkpoint

[0:30:47] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @krispen_wa YOU MISSPELLED GRASSES
[0:30:52] <CappuccinoGuil> @Sgt_Rorschach because we enjoy it too much
[0:30:52] <+BigBlackBankai> TELL ME WHY
[0:31:17] <%Dean_Inbetween> Intelligence agencies of large entities are guaranteed to be involved in very corrupt and morally dubious acts
[0:31:24] <%D00msDayDan> weird how the city's municipal AI is housed under the ONI building
[0:31:28] <TGIAbeybaby> Haha bridge go boom
[0:31:29] <%Dean_Inbetween> Its just the nature of politics
[0:31:42] <CappuccinoGuil> Sniper boys let's gooooooo
[0:32:10] <chainsaw105> Firefight map time
[0:32:20] <%Sgt_Rorschach> @dean_inbetween Especially when there’s a massive war going on where emergency powers are transferred from the Government to the Military

[0:32:31] <+yhom_tork> LuL
[0:32:32] <DigitalJoshie> snipers do work on hunters
[0:32:35] <%doomerskeletor13> Just one more bridge and we’re gonna be farming mangoes in Tahiti, Orthur
[0:32:37] <%Tearonex> Just aim the laser man
[0:32:40] <TGIAbeybaby> Never played ODST firefight only reach. Didn’t even know ODST invented the game type
[0:32:49] <+condemned_15> just laser
[0:32:54] <$BallerSwagBro9k> LAZOR
[0:32:55] <+BigBlackBankai> ODST sniper always a good idea, better close range weapon than the shotgun.
[0:32:57] <%Sgt_Rorschach> ODST Firefight is best Firefight
[0:32:58] <jorniev> use it
[0:32:59] <TheHylianGuard> I like ODST's firefight a lot more than reach's
[0:33:01] <jorniev> USE IT
[0:33:05] <%Dean_Inbetween> Oni probably keeps a check on the AI and uses it for spying, patriot act yada yada covenant war
[0:33:07] <%D00msDayDan> should i use my power weapon on the miniboss or shoot into its shield with my smg
[0:33:09] <$BallerSwagBro9k> ShoopDaWhoop ShoopDaWhoop ShoopDaWhoop ShoopDaWhoop ShoopDaWhoop
[0:33:10] <DianaTheAscian> NICE
[0:33:13] <%Cerberus_NV> ODST Firefight <3
[0:33:25] <brachydios777> Gotem
[0:33:29] <DianaTheAscian> i'd ditch the smg
[0:33:33] <chainsaw105> police officer*
[0:33:33] <%krispen_wa> Man, ODST aged super well
[0:33:35] <%Gruhunchously> Keep on keeping on
[0:33:39] <%Sgt_Rorschach> Vidmaster: Endure is Peak Firefight
[0:33:46] <%Dean_Inbetween> @sgt_rorschach but of course war time causes those things to only get more crazy and fucked up
[0:33:48] <%Reverend_Roscoe> NOT IF YOU LIVE IN AMERICA
[0:33:50] <TGIAbeybaby> @krispen_wa except for Veronicas face
[0:33:53] <dreadedcthulhu> that says a lot abt earth society huh
[0:33:55] <+yhom_tork> NA monkaS
[0:33:57] <razieltano123> SGT. Johnson: This is Firefight.
[0:34:03] <%doomerskeletor13> A lot of the Halo games have aged fairly well cause they’re fairly simple in terms of gameplay
[0:34:04] <jorniev> NOT IF YOU LIVE IN AUTHOCRACY
[0:34:08] <TheHylianGuard> MY EYES
[0:34:10] <%krispen_wa> POLE CROTOCOL
[0:34:14] <Louie_Salmon> In the future, yeah
[0:34:19] <bearwagon> pol potopol
[0:34:20] <%doomerskeletor13> Oh god the whole world became America in the future
[0:34:21] <prime_name> My pupils hate it
[0:34:21] <jorniev> ooooh
[0:34:25] <%Dean_Inbetween> Its more of a military junta
[0:34:25] <wintrysoma> the insurrection did nothing wrong
[0:34:26] <DigitalJoshie> oh ye, earth go not great
[0:34:26] <%JohnAtDawn> They are literally being exterminated
[0:34:30] <CappuccinoGuil> GEE, SOUNDS FAMILIAR, HUH?
[0:34:30] <jorniev> yeah starship troopers
[0:34:34] <%stayinthepocket> They've been in a war for like 3 decades....
[0:34:36] <brachydios777> Lil bit
[0:34:36] <+maenos2> fuck oni
[0:34:36] <+BigBlackBankai> HOLE SOLOCOL
[0:34:38] <Yummy_Nukes> can't colonize the stars without an empire
[0:34:38] <leomuratore> Is basically that in Old Man's War. But in an intergalactic sense
[0:34:44] <%doomerskeletor13> It’s Starship Troopers but without the irony most of the time lmao
[0:34:51] <%Sgt_Rorschach> 3 decades? Try 300 years
[0:34:53] <Xiangchang> I think in the Halo'verse, USA, Canada, and Mexico fused into one massive country.
[0:34:54] <%D00msDayDan> to be fair, humanity has been living under the threat of aliens showing up unannounced and invading and glassing the planet for over 20 years by now
[0:35:00] <+BigBlackBankai> WHOLE HORSACOL
[0:35:01] <CappuccinoGuil> More like coplonize
[0:35:20] <%krispen_wa> WAIT...were the insurrectionists from RvB freelancer flashbacks actually based on real lore?
[0:35:21] <%hattrick61> MOLE SCROTEICAL
[0:35:22] <%Sgt_Rorschach> @xiangchang Earth’s government is split by Continent in Halo
[0:35:26] <+VoidBastid> LUL
[0:35:26] <TGIAbeybaby> Anyone know the first human covenant interaction ? It wasn’t reach right it was way before?
[0:35:27] <$BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[0:35:27] <+yhom_tork> LuL
[0:35:30] <%Dean_Inbetween> Its a military junta, the unsc didn’t become a junta until the covenant war and the insurrection happened naturally do to the problems of space capitalism and colonial negligence
[0:35:31] <%doomerskeletor13> @krispen_wa Yup
[0:35:32] <jorniev> @krispen_wa kinda
[0:35:33] <+maenos2> hahaha
[0:35:34] <%Dean_Inbetween> Like in star wars

[0:36:07] <%krispen_wa> heroic
[0:36:10] <TGIAbeybaby> @wintrysoma gracias^2
[0:36:15] <+A_Real_American_Trash_Can> It
[0:36:25] <%garlicnuggets> garlicnuggets subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months!
[0:36:25] <+A_Real_American_Trash_Can> is on Son olf Sparda difficulty
[0:36:25] <%doomerskeletor13> There were also rebel cells that were also fascist but wanted to control their own territory
[0:36:33] <%hattrick61> @tgiabeybaby the covenant sent a message to humanity saying "God said kill you all" and that was first contact
[0:36:38] <Fareflight_> Yeah the UNSC is a provisinal government. It formed because of the threats to humanity.
[0:36:45] <%Dean_Inbetween> It happened in star wars with the outer rim it would definitely happen in halo when the technology is much mire realistic and administrative capabilities suck more
[0:36:51] <%Sgt_Rorschach> @digitaljoshie It’s their job to talk shit. They’re the only species that gets taught human languages
[0:36:56] <theteamakerofiowa> ope
[0:36:56] <+BigBlackBankai> 99% of the Human Covenant War was a series of tactical retreats.
[0:37:07] <TGIAbeybaby> @hattrick61 yeah alright I can see why humanity wasn’t to cash money about the covenant then
[0:37:07] <%Gruhunchously> Oof, that guy
[0:37:16] <jorniev> woooooah
[0:37:17] <brachydios777> t101Oof
[0:37:21] <jorniev> that was close
[0:37:27] <%D00msDayDan> i love uphill both ways
[0:37:36] <nxflre> MUSIC THO
[0:37:47] <%Dean_Inbetween> Yeah the United Earth Government had problems and inequality like any space democracy, the war only made all those problems worse
[0:37:52] <%Sgt_Rorschach> @hattrick61 It was actually peaceful at first when they met
[0:37:54] <+A_Real_American_Trash_Can> Fast beats
[0:37:59] <razieltano123> Music go UP.
[0:38:01] <+BigBlackBankai> On your left...
[0:38:11] <%Gruhunchously> It sounds like the commanding officer is a GRunt
[0:38:24] <TGIAbeybaby> This next section on legendary with the circle room alone is AIDS
[0:38:27] <jorniev> man these 3 guys are sure killing a lot of covenant
[0:38:28] <%D00msDayDan> oh no he's gonna rip off the turret immediately
[0:38:35] <Halospaz117> I think Contact Harvest might have one of my favorite First Contact scenarios due to how much of a clusterfuck it was on both sides
[0:38:36] <%Sgt_Rorschach> Yep
[0:38:49] <%Sgt_Rorschach> @d00msdaydan called it
[0:38:50] <Explodincatz> insta rips it off
[0:38:55] <Halospaz117> No?
[0:38:57] <+maenos2> cole protocol
[0:38:58] <mesamus> woolie why did you took it off NotLikeThis
[0:38:58] <wintrysoma> oh god
[0:38:59] <digitalslime> shouldn't have done that
[0:38:59] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> WHAT
[0:39:04] <Nomad94> Whoops
[0:39:05] <andrewofbob> Infinite ammo is for chumps
[0:39:05] <%krispen_wa> Oof
[0:39:15] <wragglee> fuck oni, me and my homies hate oni
[0:39:20] <CappuccinoGuil> Was that Johnson just now?
[0:39:25] <%Sgt_Rorschach> ONI is the CIA for all of Humanity
[0:39:26] <+yhom_tork> plausible deniability Kappa
[0:39:28] <%alpacasintophats> no
[0:39:28] <Halospaz117> No, it sounds like Stacker tho
[0:39:30] <jorniev> NOT JAOHNSON
[0:39:31] <%marrs_bars> Woolie is showing the Covenant his STRENGTH SMOrc
[0:39:36] <TGIAbeybaby> Alright fellas and ladies real talk. Which part of Jojos is y’all’s favorite
[0:39:37] <TheHylianGuard> They have a great value brand illuminati logo
[0:39:37] <%alpacasintophats> that'd be stacker I believe?
[0:39:38] <DigitalJoshie> ONI is super sketch
[0:39:38] <mdkcde> more likeSpace Gestapo
[0:39:41] <+BigBlackBankai> They're NERV
[0:39:42] <Yummy_Nukes> yeah but genocidal aliems tho
[0:39:45] <+Walopoh> may or may not be considered a secondary antagonist of the franchise
[0:39:45] <Halospaz117> Though it wouldn't really make sense for it to be Stacker cuz he's a cop
[0:39:46] <%hattrick61> @cappuccinoguil no it was Stackers voice actor
[0:39:47] <wragglee> STRENGTH GO UP
[0:39:48] <maskedmustelid> can you put the turret back on the tripod to reload, or am I thinking of a different game?
[0:39:53] <TGIAbeybaby> No
[0:39:56] <TGIAbeybaby> I think
[0:39:57] <%Sgt_Rorschach> They’re UMBRELLA + KGB
[0:40:05] <%hattrick61> @maskedmustelid that's Wolfenstein
[0:40:12] <TheHylianGuard> Either Woolie turned on VISR mode again or that was a flare
[0:40:18] <Halospaz117> it was a flare
[0:40:19] <maskedmustelid> that's it
[0:40:19] <%Dean_Inbetween> Yes they are very shady and just as morally dubious as the irl CIA if not worse but yeah 30 year war with a military junta managing the government will cause that...
[0:40:20] <%Reverend_Roscoe> FLARE
[0:40:21] <+JeluxDaCasual> Office of Naval Intelligence
[0:40:39] <TGIAbeybaby> Office of Never In the wrong
[0:40:40] <Decimated_body> nice
[0:40:42] <+Walopoh> In a story with no genocidal alien cult army, ONI would be the bad guys
[0:40:45] <chainsaw105> that jackal held that frag
[0:40:53] <%Dean_Inbetween> The unsc probably let oni do whatever the fuck they want do to the war
[0:40:54] <Nomad94> ONI stands for Obviously No Intelligence
[0:41:02] <%Sgt_Rorschach> @dean_inbetween Exactly. That’s one of my favorite parts about Halo, the shitty parts are very realistic
[0:41:11] <TGIAbeybaby> Jackal with beam rifle BibleThump
[0:41:12] <%krispen_wa> Oh No, Icky
[0:41:19] <+condemned_15> Firefight is basically the backbone of ODST
[0:41:28] <%D00msDayDan> remember ONI started the spartan program long before the war, they've always been shady
[0:41:34] <%alpacasintophats> READY FOR VENGEANCE
[0:41:52] <TGIAbeybaby> @d00msdaydan nothing wrong with a little kidnapping
[0:41:54] <Minerslovegames> ONI is the CIA in space, taken to its logical extreme.
[0:41:55] <razieltano123> "Let me turret, you suck at it."
[0:42:02] <chainsaw105> aaaaaaand space laser
[0:42:05] <theteamakerofiowa> SPACE CIAAAAA
[0:42:06] <%krispen_wa> but what was Halsey's ONI Protocol?
[0:42:06] <%Dean_Inbetween> Democracy in the human colonial empire has mostly been reduced to a rump of what it was hence the military government and EVEN MORE SHADY SHIT
[0:42:06] <%doomerskeletor13> Mom said it’s my turn on the turret
[0:42:24] <%Dean_Inbetween> Do to the covenant destroying there planets
[0:42:24] <%Sgt_Rorschach> Humanity always wins the ground fight. Covenant always wins in Space. That’s why Humanity is losing the war
[0:42:30] <%Dean_Inbetween> Yep^^^
[0:42:33] <Explodincatz> u HAD a turret
[0:42:37] <+Walopoh> Well the covenant can just keep throwing a near infinite population at soldiers at the enemies
[0:42:37] <%Tearonex> Maybe picking guns off the ground would help with that
[0:42:49] <%krispen_wa> Just turn space into the ground forehead
[0:42:50] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1313474077307396101?s=19
[0:42:53] <TGIAbeybaby> @sgt_rorschach unless master chief yeets himself off a space station with a nuke
[0:43:02] <DigitalJoshie> god ODST grenade throw arc is so weird
[0:43:08] <TGIAbeybaby> ^
[0:43:08] <torres_kun> These marines are holding off waves of Covenant lol, no super armor, no steroid, no nothing
[0:43:19] <Minerslovegames> I'd say the good outweighs most of the bad in this case, at least until the war has ended. After the war, when things try to switch back to some sense of normalcy is when ONI starts to really get grilled.
[0:43:23] <%Dean_Inbetween> The covenant is basically like 7 times the size of humanity the problem is that conducting a war of genocide efficiently is nearly impossible
[0:43:35] <%Dean_Inbetween> And the covenant felt the burm
[0:43:37] <%Dean_Inbetween> Burn*
[0:43:41] <TGIAbeybaby> Grunt revolution
[0:43:45] <%Sgt_Rorschach> @minerslovegames They don’t get grilled, they literally pin it all on Halsey
[0:43:45] <+BigBlackBankai> 7 or 70?
[0:43:51] <%krispen_wa> these marines are killing way more soldiers than the entirety of Team Noble
[0:43:58] <Nomad94> @Dean_Inbetween also the covenant is a mess of betrayal, politics and conspiracy
[0:44:07] <%Dean_Inbetween> Yep
[0:44:22] <wragglee> FUCK oni bro
[0:44:22] <$BallerSwagBro9k> The shaft is gonna blow Kappa
[0:44:22] <+BigBlackBankai> I want a game where I also fight Innies.
[0:44:28] <%Sgt_Rorschach> Drones incomibg
[0:44:30] <+maenos2> shaft blowing. hehe
[0:44:31] <dot_theory> Buggas
[0:44:37] <%doomerskeletor13> I want a game where we fight the UNSC
[0:44:40] <Ynkubus_> its only a handful of them
[0:44:42] <+Estuko> isn't plasma weapons absolutely nightmarish to the UNSC? or anything actually lol
[0:44:46] <%Sgt_Rorschach> This is where you die
[0:44:49] <+yhom_tork> drones monkaS
[0:44:52] <+condemned_15> bet that bug spray
[0:44:54] <+BigBlackBankai> Tru
[0:44:55] <%doomerskeletor13> brownS brownS brownS
[0:44:59] <Nomad94> rooah
[0:45:00] <TGIAbeybaby> All my homies hate buggers
[0:45:00] <%Gruhunchously> OOH RAH
[0:45:00] <%Dean_Inbetween> Yeah it melts your armor AND fuses it to your skin AND ORGANS
[0:45:01] <+A_Real_American_Trash_Can> Would RAID work on them?
[0:45:08] <TGIAbeybaby> Space Raid
[0:45:12] <%Dean_Inbetween> Making surgery nearly impossible
[0:45:13] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @Estuko Oh yeah, that shit burn hotter than thermite, needlers are amor piercing too
[0:45:16] <%Sgt_Rorschach> Using Night vision in dark areas? Not in day time?
[0:45:20] <+JohnRSoviet> getting hit with plasma is not a fun time
[0:45:31] <chainsaw105> I remember reading something where a soldier got hit by a charged plasma pistol and it basically melted their guts
[0:45:34] <Ynkubus_> idk plasma keeps you fuzzy and warm
[0:45:35] <%Sgt_Rorschach> Getting hit with a Needle is a worse time
[0:45:37] <TGIAbeybaby> @johnrsoviet speaking from experience?
[0:45:42] <%Gruhunchously> Does the melted armor fuse to your skin or something?
[0:45:44] <wragglee> i wouldnt think getting shot by anything the UNSC or Covenant is working with would be a fun time
[0:45:49] <%hattrick61> The reason plasma grenades stick is because the weld to your armor/flesh
[0:45:50] <%Sgt_Rorschach> @gruhunchously yes
[0:45:52] <Minerslovegames> books really go into detail about how the plasma effects skin and flesh. It's... not pretty.
[0:45:54] <%emperordread> Inject plasma into your blood to cure covid
[0:45:58] <+Firemane1279> @gruhunchously it does a lot more than that >_>
[0:45:58] <FreedomARX7> basically yeah
[0:46:06] <%krispen_wa> LUL
[0:46:08] <+Estuko> @BallerSwagBro9k that's so scary, I guess it's Legendary all the time for the guys, that sucks for the sake of fashion-dst
[0:46:11] <%Sgt_Rorschach> Plasma also instantly cauterizes the wounds too
[0:46:12] <%Dean_Inbetween> Yeah the covenant is very much a patch work where as humanity has only been consolidating itself more and more being pushed to the extreme
[0:46:16] <Halospaz117> Well great, you hurt Mickey's feelings
[0:46:27] <wragglee> Woolie the unkillable
[0:46:29] <+chunkyfranku> YOU LIVED!
[0:46:33] <+JohnRSoviet> remember woolie, that brute shot has a big ol blade on it
[0:46:37] <+BigBlackBankai> Mickey got some lines...
[0:46:41] <+Walopoh> Very realistic LUL
[0:46:42] <%hattrick61> TWIST HIS DICK
[0:46:44] <Onatamana> Woolie doesn't really seem to realize the true rate of fire for the brute shot.
[0:46:45] <%Sgt_Rorschach> The Needles tho, those literally feel like a fiberglass dagger that stabs into you and then explodes into thousands of tiny shards
[0:46:47] <%krispen_wa> hmmmmmm
[0:46:51] <%D00msDayDan> the NMPD is almost as militarized as american police departments
[0:46:51] <%doomerskeletor13> The relevance
[0:46:52] <Minerslovegames> v. no.
[0:46:53] <@Solidus_113> hmmmmmMmmmmmm
[0:46:54] <alexandrecau> Sometime you gotta arrst airborne civilians you know

[0:47:08] <$serpenttucker> Ohthats gonna get REAL old

[0:48:48] <chainsaw105> aren't the skyboxesa the reason why the reticle isn't centered by default?
[0:48:49] <Nomad94> @BigBlackBankai *Komm *süßer *Tod
[0:48:53] <+A_Real_American_Trash_Can> @Dean_Inbetween I think you mean the OST?
[0:48:54] <%doomerskeletor13> This was DLC that got turned into a full game
[0:48:57] <Minerslovegames> nmpd we're seeing right now I imagine are SWAT team and regular cops who busted into the armory when things got REALLY bad with the Covenant.
[0:49:18] <DemonicHoward> he played titan fall 2
[0:49:18] <razieltano123> Half-Life.
[0:49:25] <+yhom_tork> imagine halo with doom gameplay Kreygasm
[0:49:29] <%Sgt_Rorschach> @doomerskeletor13 This was always a full game. Bungie’s contract with Microsoft forced them to release 2 Halos after Halo 3
[0:49:30] <+BigBlackBankai> @Nomad94 Pokemon Emerald version
[0:49:33] <TGIAbeybaby> Half life alyx stream ??????
[0:49:34] <%Dean_Inbetween> @a_real_american_trash_can maybe both I mean a man in uniform can be enticing KappaPride
[0:49:45] <@Solidus_113> Black Mesa doesn't really count
[0:49:45] <%hattrick61> and Titanfall
[0:49:53] <+jiggy_snipe> Titanfall does count
[0:49:53] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:50:00] <brunoberserk> PREDICTABO dnoGEESE
[0:50:09] <%Gruhunchously> Black Mesa is a modern remake of a game from the 90s, so...
[0:50:20] <%Javaa01> Up-ressed
[0:50:27] <%Sgt_Rorschach> This is an arena shooter, it feels like an arena shooter
[0:50:27] <+A_Real_American_Trash_Can> @Dean_Inbetween Wait I get how you would proceed with the ODST, but like would you be doing stuff with the disc for the OST?
[0:50:33] <%Dean_Inbetween> Woolie has to play episode 2 before he goes ANYWHERE NEAR alyx
[0:50:33] <%Javaa01> But all the assets are still the same as they were in the 360 release
[0:50:40] <kikoeru_san> are they still avoiding the audio logs?
[0:50:44] <TGIAbeybaby> Was ODST touched up ?
[0:50:45] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> BEST HALO MISSION COMING UP
[0:50:54] <+chunkyfranku> yea
[0:51:00] <%Javaa01> Alyx absolutely assumes you have played all of mainline Half Life up to that point
[0:51:05] <%Sgt_Rorschach> The only parts of ODST that got changed were the Bungie Easter eggs
[0:51:06] <digitalslime> tbh i think this port is just a tad worse then console with glitches and menues so far.
[0:51:09] <%D00msDayDan> @kikoeru_san they don't want to risk another crash, whether it was actually the audio logs' fault or not
[0:51:17] <%hattrick61> @kikoeru_san Yeah the game crashed last time so they're gonna watch em all at the end
[0:51:21] <%Dean_Inbetween> @a_real_american_trash_can unfortunately the hole is too small on the disc for me to do anything with :3
[0:51:31] <%Gruhunchously> DETOUR>>>
[0:51:36] <%doomerskeletor13> Alyx is absolutely meant to played after 2 and it’s DLCs
[0:51:38] <kikoeru_san> someone's told them they can pick them up and not listen right?
[0:51:42] <+chunkyfranku> went to far away from each other lmao
[0:51:52] <%Sgt_Rorschach> @kikoeru_san that is true
[0:51:54] <+JeluxDaCasual> @kikoeru_san yes
[0:52:02] <%Dean_Inbetween> Alyx is a game MADE for half life fans
[0:52:04] <+JeluxDaCasual> tap to collect, hold to play
[0:52:05] <chainsaw105> start of the game again
[0:52:06] <TGIAbeybaby> Can you play ODST camping with two or four people
[0:52:08] <%Gruhunchously> I think the Half Life Episodes were full releases, not DLCs
[0:52:11] <+condemned_15> SourPls
[0:52:12] <%Javaa01> They reference the events of Episode 2 in like hour 2 of Alyx

[0:55:15] <brachydios777> It uses African sounding instruments on purpose
[0:55:17] <@Menitta> amazing
[0:55:31] <torres_kun> The drums sound very much like Reach
[0:55:33] <%Gruhunchously> Because this is Africa?
[0:55:34] <%Dean_Inbetween> Dude I love how halo has african influences in its soundtrack
[0:55:36] <%a_goth_pancake> !uptime
[0:55:36] <@Moobot> @a_goth_pancake WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 11 minutes
[0:55:40] <torres_kun> That ONE song from Reach
[0:55:48] <MmmokayByron> Is the Saxophone part of the reason why V is into you know who, that he talked about in Reach?
[0:55:48] <%Sgt_Rorschach> @hattrick61 You can actually see Mickey’s pod in the intro cutscene, because he’s the one who crashes into the Rookie
[0:55:49] <%Dean_Inbetween> Halo always had african influences in its music
[0:55:58] <+DesertPenguin> Great drum
[0:56:02] <+DesertPenguin> My first drum
[0:56:06] <TGIAbeybaby> @torres_kun do you mean the title screen nut theme

[0:56:23] <torres_kun> @tgiabeybaby yes lol
[0:56:29] <%D00msDayDan> consider this: the ark portal is in africa, humanity originated from africa, therefore the forerunner-era humans were black
[0:56:37] <%Dean_Inbetween> Yea^^^
[0:56:39] <brachydios777> A ghost will be useful
[0:56:40] <%Dean_Inbetween> uh

[0:58:59] <%hattrick61> Hope y'all ain't afraid of heights
[0:58:59] <%D00msDayDan> imagine if walking up to that broken sniper rifle still gave you ammo if you were already carrying one
[0:58:59] <FreedomARX7> Its go time
[0:59:02] <TGIAbeybaby> Rookie has now soul linked with the sniper rifle
[0:59:03] <+SassyBassy_> There are actuallThere are actually two different Starless's. King Crimson album with the instrumental "Starless and Bible Black" and King Crimson's "Starless" track on the Red Album.
[0:59:04] <%Sgt_Rorschach> Bent Sniper for Cursed Halo
[0:59:08] <%cobalt_phoenix_> so the rookie is just wandering around finding wreckage... for what purpose exactly?
[0:59:15] <+condemned_15> Romeo played by Nolan North
[0:59:16] <TGIAbeybaby> To find his squad
[0:59:16] <%Dean_Inbetween> There was I believe a halo 3 arg that bungie released of a tribesman in ethopia watching the forerunners construct the ark portal
[0:59:17] <REGNIERx> Best song in halo hands down
[0:59:20] <Halospaz117> This mission has the best song in the game
[0:59:20] <FreedomARX7> hes on the teams trail
[0:59:20] <sniffy77> hes just vibing around the city
[0:59:22] <%a_goth_pancake> so they already did alpha sits?
[0:59:26] <%doomerskeletor13> @cobalt_phoenix_ To find his squad and figure out what happened
[0:59:29] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[0:59:30] <Nomad94> @cobalt_phoenix_ trying to find out where they all went
[0:59:34] <DSD24> Sir I can't respond I am a silent protag
[0:59:34] <%Sgt_Rorschach> @cobalt_phoenix_ Finding his team, he’s alone in an alien occupied city
[0:59:35] <+JeluxDaCasual> @cobalt_phoenix_ he woke up 6 hours after everyone else. He's looking for clues.
[0:59:44] <TGIAbeybaby> Buck likes to Fu-
[0:59:44] <%doomerskeletor13> He can’t speak Nathan
[0:59:46] <sonofthedeepsouth> Chad Romeo
[0:59:50] <+A_Real_American_Trash_Can> Wait really he thinks Rookie has voice lines? Come on Buck you know better
[0:59:52] <%Dean_Inbetween> Nah best halo song is **GETS SHOT**
[1:00:06] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ok thanks, i've been kinda lost on what he's tryin to do but makes sense
[1:00:07] <%D00msDayDan> BANSHEES, FAST AND LOW
[1:00:07] <asd2897> BANSHEES FAST AND LOW
[1:00:08] <%Dean_Inbetween> Because the answer is everything
[1:00:12] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Ammo count!!!
[1:00:13] <DianaTheAscian> they're gors his ear
[1:00:20] <+ygernesfeld> that ammo count continuity

[1:00:22] <sonofthedeepsouth> ROMEO THE HDGEHEG
[1:00:22] <DSD24> Is he really edgy or just a asshole?
[1:00:26] <%Gruhunchously> I thought Emile was the edge lord
[1:00:27] <chainsaw105> I love how Romeo starts the mission with only one shot because he fired off three

[1:00:34] <%doomerskeletor13> The Emile prototype

[1:00:52] <sonofthedeepsouth> Nice insubordination
[1:00:53] <Halospaz117> Emile is edgy, Romeo's just a asshole
[1:00:54] <+A_Real_American_Trash_Can> @Halospaz117 True, I guess combat grunts and snores could technically imply status of person.

[1:03:53] <trackles_64> Wasnt there going to be a Dredd 2?
[1:03:56] <%a_goth_pancake> this IS 30 years into the war and earth IS the last human stronghold.

[1:04:14] <+JohnRSoviet> Shit, Buck, get it together!

[1:04:21] <Explodincatz> open it for him!
[1:04:23] <%doomerskeletor13> Buck you’re drunk
[1:04:25] <%marrs_bars> greatest soldier in the world...Big Boss
[1:04:27] <TGIAbeybaby> Where was buck on reach
[1:04:29] <sonofthedeepsouth> The Longest of days
[1:04:32] <T_Sasquatch> We need to build a space wall
[1:04:37] <TGIAbeybaby> Was he a marine back then or ODST
[1:04:39] <FreedomARX7> Buck been sneaking sips from the flask
[1:04:44] <+TheShisno> Still an ODST
[1:04:46] <%Sgt_Rorschach> @tgiabeybaby Buck shows up in one of the Reach levels
[1:04:48] <%doomerskeletor13> Buck, if he was any better, he’d be a Spartan
[1:04:52] <TGIAbeybaby> Oooooh
[1:04:53] <%hattrick61> GREATEST SOLDIER KILLS THE DOORS, BIG BUCC
[1:04:54] <%Sgt_Rorschach> New Alexandria
[1:05:09] <%Gruhunchously> You guys should play Republic Commando
[1:05:17] <%doomerskeletor13> @tgiabeybaby He was still ODST, that was only like a month or two ago
[1:05:18] <+JohnRSoviet> @doomerskeletor13 well, he does become a Spartan IV
[1:05:28] <Nomad94> No spoilers
[1:05:31] <sonofthedeepsouth> Why have spartans if ODSTs can carry that shit
[1:05:35] <+TheShisno> Remember, Reach and ODST are only a few months apart and Buck is a Gunnery Sergeant
[1:05:39] <%Dean_Inbetween> @a_goth_pancake its not the last its just the only important one left also the covenant specifically wanted to systematically exterminate all the humans so yes the farthest planets first and the oldest last
[1:05:40] <%Sgt_Rorschach> @nomad94 these aren’t spolers
[1:05:43] <TGIAbeybaby> I forget how close the timeline is for everything happening in halo lore
[1:05:46] <%Sgt_Rorschach> *spoilers
[1:05:47] <%hattrick61> F4 enema
[1:05:55] <Nomad94> @Sgt_Rorschach they are though
[1:06:00] <%Sgt_Rorschach> How
[1:06:05] <%doomerskeletor13> Tis but a scratch
[1:06:11] <%Gruhunchously> @TGIAbeybaby The whole trilogy takes place in the timeframe of like, three months
[1:06:21] <%hattrick61> @sgt_rorschach saying what happens in halo 5 is a spoiler
[1:06:28] <trackles_64> Are they going to finish the game this session?
[1:06:30] <%a_goth_pancake> @dean_inbetween sooooo... anyone who can hold a gun should have been prepared for an alien invasion?
[1:06:33] <%Sgt_Rorschach> Knowing Buck has energy shields doesn’t spoil plot
[1:06:39] <TGIAbeybaby> Imagine drinking some coffee and an alien armada just rips a fat hole in space time over your city
[1:06:39] <+TheShisno> Halo 1 is September, 2 is October, 3 is November
[1:06:40] <DSD24> Botchamania!
[1:06:41] <+A_Real_American_Trash_Can> I always perceive the Red Jelly in FPSs as the depletion of a "luck meter" and once it runs out you are now unlucky and actually start taking shots for real.
[1:06:51] <Nomad94> @Sgt_Rorschach mentioning things that haven't happened yet is what spoilers are
[1:06:59] <+BigBlackBankai> SOILED IT
[1:07:12] <%Gruhunchously> That Winston Tech
[1:07:13] <%a_goth_pancake> oh yeah, buck will walk up to dead bodies and tell them to rip.
[1:07:18] <%Sgt_Rorschach> Mentioning things that spoil the plot is a spoiler. Mentioning a minor detail is nothing
[1:07:19] <+TheShisno> @Nomad94 They already played Reach and it's earlier in the timeline
[1:07:24] <%ZeroCruz> No spoilerinos
[1:07:31] <Nomad94> @TheShisno they were talking about the Spartan IV thing
[1:07:31] <%stayinthepocket> Guys it hardly matters cause nothing of note happens in 5 anyway
[1:07:38] <+TheShisno> Oh yeah
[1:07:40] <%Gruhunchously> lol
[1:07:45] <%Sgt_Rorschach> @stayinthepocket exactly
[1:07:48] <%doomerskeletor13> @sgt_rorschach It’s a thing that happens in another game, it’s 100% a spoiler
[1:07:48] <+yhom_tork> PogChamp
[1:07:52] <TGIAbeybaby> John 117 is a Spartan. Sorry for the spoilers
[1:07:55] <%Irridium> I mean considering how 343 themselves are hard ignoring 5 does it really matter
[1:07:56] <+TheShisno> Yeah Halo 5 doesn't exist
[1:07:56] <Nomad94> @stayinthepocket funny haha joke, but that's not for you to decide
[1:07:57] <%Dean_Inbetween> Why wouldn’t earth be the last one they wanted to destroy every human installation they weren’t island hopping @a_goth_pancake also how the fuck do you mobilize billions of people for war across an entire empire, humanity was politically falling apart there was no way they could enforce that
[1:08:04] <Manjove> yeah, but who cares, its just halo 5
[1:08:13] <TGIAbeybaby> Speaking of halo 5
[1:08:19] <TGIAbeybaby> Who enjoyed the campaign
[1:08:21] <Nomad94> being pretentious about Halo 5 is going to ruin it for anyone who wants to try the game with an open mind.
[1:08:24] <%Sgt_Rorschach> @doomerskeletor13 Master Chief shoots a gun in Halo 4 and 5. Is that a Spoiler? No. Did that happen yet? No
[1:08:31] <%stayinthepocket> @nomad94 It was funny thank you
[1:08:34] <+Firemane1279> Master Chief's name is Big Johns. Kappa LUL
[1:08:38] <stormhawk9891> He's fine
[1:08:39] <razieltano123> Buck is fucking dead.
[1:08:44] <RealDurdyDan> John Halo
[1:08:44] <torres_kun> Halo 5 felt better and was funner to play than 4
[1:08:44] <Minerslovegames> I enjoy halo 4
[1:08:50] <trackles_64> Halo 5 is the best Halo game ever made
[1:08:54] <torres_kun> But the story was just terrible
[1:08:54] <%doomerskeletor13> @sgt_rorschach Saying “blank character becomes a blank” is a spoiler dude. You’re being ridiculous
[1:09:03] <TGIAbeybaby> Hold on partner @trackles_64
[1:09:06] <%Aeriqui> i love this track so much
[1:09:06] <torres_kun> Complete opposite of 4
[1:09:06] <Manjove> gameplay is fine, but the story is nonsense, and i only really like halo for the story
[1:09:07] <+yhom_tork> halo 5 is dope, at least gameplaywise
[1:09:09] <%Sgt_Rorschach> Only if that impacted the plot at all
[1:09:10] <Nomad94> @Sgt_Rorschach you're too disingeuous to talk to.
[1:09:12] <Minerslovegames> I liked the campaign and the multiplayer of 4
[1:09:20] <Halospaz117> @Sgt_Rorschach Neat, still a fucking spoiler so fucking shut it
[1:09:22] <%ZeroCruz> Halo 5 is that even real ?
[1:09:25] <TGIAbeybaby> I throw my hat in the ring and say halo 2 was my favorite @trackles_64
[1:09:27] <Nomad94> 5 has a great speedrun too
[1:09:35] <%Sgt_Rorschach> Buck could be an ODST in Halo 5 and literally nothing would change
[1:09:41] <%a_goth_pancake> @sgt_rorschach hey, how bout this; that character survives the game we're currently playing? spoilers.
[1:09:41] <Halospaz117> FUCKING SHUT UP

[1:10:51] <+Msytic6> This track sounds a little like golden eye

[1:20:47] <%D00msDayDan> @Bonesmasher43 this is a society that has been living under the threat of aliens showing up unannounced go glass everything for over 20 years
[1:20:48] <%HaloPlayerNamedJohn> Apparently Halo 3 odst had the smallest amount of community testing before it released on pc
[1:20:52] <sonofthedeepsouth> But to be fair Aliens tho
[1:20:57] <%Dapper_Cactuar> Outer Wilds is such a great game
[1:21:00] <%krispen_wa> Nah Outer Worlds is the black hole time loop thing
[1:21:00] <chainsaw105> Upon the destruction of that Phantom it activated Bites The Dust

[1:21:16] <DatAsuna> worlds is disappoint but pat is crazy f he thinks the cannery prologue is the best part
[1:21:22] <RamenRiderZ> we need Otter Wilds and Otter Worlds to confuse more
[1:21:22] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> would have been great if Pat didn't spoil it for me
[1:21:22] <%Sgt_Rorschach> Sgt_Rorschach gifted a Tier 1 sub to D00msDayDan! They have given 4 Gift Subs in the channel!
[1:21:23] <+jiggy_snipe> lol
[1:21:23] <%doomerskeletor13> @krispen_wa Other way around. That’s Outer Wilds

[1:21:49] <%a_goth_pancake> Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[1:21:50] <%Dapper_Cactuar> my GOTY nominees so far are Outer Wilds, SOR4, Ultrakill, and Nioh 2
[1:21:52] <%krispen_wa> everything after the prologue was mediocre
[1:21:56] <DatAsuna> The cannery is so fuckin' nothing no
[1:21:59] <T_Sasquatch> What are the chances of both games being announced and released nearly at the same time
[1:22:03] <%Sgt_Rorschach> Sgt_Rorschach gifted a Tier 1 sub to Dean_Inbetween! They have given 5 Gift Subs in the channel!
[1:22:13] <DatAsuna> You pick up parvati, rewire the powr and fuckin' leave because it's boring as shit
[1:22:15] <sonofthedeepsouth> It works like I want to works
[1:22:25] <%Dean_Inbetween> Dawww why’d you do that? @sgt_rorschach BibleThump <3
[1:22:25] <%krispen_wa> if the cannery was nothing, then the rest of the game was worse than nothing
[1:22:40] <sonofthedeepsouth> Nah Dokapon has to wait another 2 years I think

[1:23:36] <%krispen_wa> KORRA BOOK TWO IS WORSE THAN HORRIBLE
[1:23:40] <%Dapper_Cactuar> no matter how hard you try, subsequent playthroughs don't have the magic of the first one except in a few instances
[1:23:40] <sonofthedeepsouth> And Korra book 3 made Mako dirty
[1:23:45] <%afronooch> @SpartanSeventyEight LUL tru
[1:23:46] <DatAsuna> Or getting into space crimes on the hope, or gettig parvati laid
[1:23:54] <DatAsuna> What does the cannery actually have?
[1:23:55] <%stayinthepocket> Aww hell yeah Shadows of Reach will be here on the 27th woolieYE
[1:24:02] <Tuna_Can_0> the only thing I enjoyed in outer worlds was murdering all of the last planet because of some glitch
[1:24:03] <DatAsuna> I has rewire the power to the hippies or the cannery
[1:24:09] <%doomerskeletor13> @stayinthepocket woolieGASM woolieGASM woolieGASM aw hell yeah
[1:24:10] <DemonicHoward> woolie notice a few games to be a bit buggy on your rig, might want to check for maintainence
[1:24:11] <trackles_64> LAUNCH BUGS
[1:24:12] <DatAsuna> It's the worst prt of the game besides maybe that asteroid
[1:24:26] <Yummy_Nukes> probably the montreal construction unions maybe
[1:24:36] <%D00msDayDan> resume will not resume from checkpoint
[1:24:36] <+Bailey__gaming> Did Woolie See the dreads in Baulders Gate 3? if so did he like them?
[1:24:48] <DatAsuna> If you think the cannery is the best part, you think the game sucks and the new game smell is what you like, not the cannery
[1:24:49] <%Irridium> Irridium subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! It's kind of incredible how well all these games still hold up. Even Halo 1, nearly 20 years old and basic as it is, is still a real solid game. Real impressive how they managed to do five games in a row and none are stinkers.
[1:24:50] <%doomerskeletor13> No clue if he saw it or not
[1:24:54] <DemonicHoward> checkpoints do not work in co-op
[1:25:00] <%krispen_wa> it was the best at capturing the tone of late stage capitalism. the rest of the game didn't really take the theme much further or offee any interesting choices except "don't be a capialist scumbag" and "be a capitalist scumbag"
[1:25:02] <DatAsuna> cause even when pat said that, he mentioned nothing actually specific to the cannery
[1:25:07] <%slimmixrp> Final rally point
[1:25:07] <DatAsuna> Only that the world was new
[1:25:11] <%Sgt_Rorschach> Last Rally Point will get you there
[1:25:14] <%a_goth_pancake> should start on the helipad
[1:25:18] <%stayinthepocket> @doomerskeletor13 I really really hope it bridges well into Infinite
[1:25:19] <sonofthedeepsouth> Based Mob stye construction unions. Their corruption anihilating workers causes like noone else
[1:25:20] <+RahuHordika> just use the last rally point
[1:25:25] <%Dean_Inbetween> Some people actually still say halo 1 has the best gameplay loop and balance regarding it @irridium
[1:25:26] <%a_goth_pancake> wait wait
[1:25:26] <MajoraZ> yes
[1:25:28] <%slimmixrp> GG we fix things
[1:25:29] <RamenRiderZ> No-one fucking cares about the Cannery anymore, next bit
[1:25:29] <DemonicHoward> yeah
[1:25:29] <+condemned_15> yes
[1:25:30] <%Sgt_Rorschach> Yep!!!
[1:25:30] <DianaTheAscian> yes
[1:25:31] <%hattrick61> ye
[1:25:32] <Nomad94> Yes
[1:25:35] <PhazonSuited> there is nothing else it should be
[1:25:35] <+NeonTurnip> i believe so
[1:25:36] <%doomerskeletor13> Yes
[1:25:37] <%HaloPlayerNamedJohn> yep
[1:25:39] <brachydios777> Ye ye ye!
[1:25:39] <%D00msDayDan> rally points have descriptions
[1:25:40] <Xiangchang> I've got no clue.
[1:25:41] <Yummy_Nukes> aye
[1:25:44] <%krispen_wa> okay alright then Outer Worlds just sucks and the new game smell was the only thing good about it
[1:25:44] <%Sgt_Rorschach> You should start on that rickety bridge
[1:25:50] <brachydios777> Affirmative
[1:25:55] <Tuna_Can_0> idk lol
[1:25:56] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[1:26:00] <%Sgt_Rorschach> Yep
[1:26:08] <@Solidus_113> if ODST is this broken, I have no hope for Halo 4's port
[1:26:15] <%Dean_Inbetween> Oh boy
[1:26:19] <%krispen_wa> UN-FINISH THE FIGHT
[1:26:19] <%doomerskeletor13> Is 4 already on PC?
[1:26:23] <DigitalJoshie> no
[1:26:23] <%Sgt_Rorschach> No
[1:26:24] <%Dean_Inbetween> No
[1:26:25] <sonofthedeepsouth> The Fight wants to continue
[1:26:26] <%D00msDayDan> @Solidus_113 or halo 4 will be the least broken because it's the newest, it could go either way
[1:26:26] <%Dean_Inbetween> Not yet
[1:26:26] <%a_goth_pancake> nah
[1:26:30] <sonofthedeepsouth> For woolie
[1:26:31] <RamenRiderZ> REFINISH
[1:26:31] <%Dean_Inbetween> Its coming next

[1:26:35] <%hattrick61> Re-Finish the fight
[1:26:38] <+condemned_15> You Can (Not) Re:Finish The Fight Xrd Climax
[1:26:38] <%doomerskeletor13> Any indication of when 4 will drop?
[1:26:39] <%Dapper_Cactuar> I haven't played through this game a single time without major glitches happening
[1:26:40] <DatAsuna> I'm more on board for saying the whole game sucks and the appeal wears off in an hour than to say the cannery is actually good
[1:26:41] <Xiangchang> 4's going to start PC flighting later this month, probably. Or early next month.
[1:26:43] <+RahuHordika> Is 4 on the same engine as the bungie games?
[1:26:44] <DigitalJoshie> but I don't know whats up, I haven't have it happen to me ever?
[1:26:45] <%TheEpicTree> The Fight Wants More Fight
[1:26:47] <%stayinthepocket> Shit happens
[1:26:49] <%Sgt_Rorschach> @doomerskeletor13 Next Month
[1:26:49] <SpaceGuntank> finish the fight, but then start the fight again to finish it one more time.
[1:26:57] <penitentpentwitch> Curse Covenant Time Tech and their ability to Unfinish the Fight!
[1:26:58] <AndyAsteroid> Patch my PP out, you know. You know what I'm saying
[1:26:58] <brachydios777> @rahuhordika Absolutely it isn’t
[1:26:58] <DatAsuna> Because what convos, what NPCs, what decisions or quests in it stuck out?
[1:27:12] <DatAsuna> Parvati's okay but the few good convos she has happen later anyway
[1:27:21] <+RahuHordika> It might be a different situation then for the port, probably, hopefully...
[1:27:33] <jorniev> BEP BAP BOOM
[1:27:41] <maskedmustelid> Stabbed with a sniper barrel!

[1:34:29] <%Irridium> this track sounds Xenoblades-y honestly
[1:34:31] <%Irridium> I dig it
[1:34:31] <chainsaw105> I love Rookie's mannerisms. Even if he doesn't speak you can totally get his personality
[1:34:32] <+wunp_fxs> so much nostalgia for halo1
[1:34:32] <%Dean_Inbetween> If im including halo 2 with its anniversary remixes i say that, but odst is great
[1:34:36] <%D00msDayDan> still jamming to covenant dance to this day
[1:34:38] <sonofthedeepsouth> memed to death
[1:34:39] <$RunningNGunning> Halo 3 has the best highlights imo, ODST is the most consistently great

[1:34:50] <%Buttface_> why does he hurt me like this

[1:35:02] <%Buttface_> why does he swap pistol over smg
[1:35:03] <brachydios777> Halo in general has some of the best soundtracks in all of video games
[1:35:05] <Explodincatz> still love 1 ost the most
[1:35:06] <Jashter18> ODST and Reach have some of my favorite songs
[1:35:07] <sonofthedeepsouth> 🤔
[1:35:09] <f0rgeman> ODST is the best to listen through but other soundtracks have higher peaks IMO

[1:37:35] <%Irridium> garbage elephant
[1:37:36] <%hattrick61> The Olifant garbage truck
[1:37:41] <pfctwinkletoes> totally different
[1:37:43] <DatAsuna> @Dean_Inbetween I actually think 4 has one of the best soudntracks but with the huge caveat that it actually uses it's songs terribly
[1:37:49] <%HaloPlayerNamedJohn> I'll say that H4's 117 and Green & Blue I come back to on occasion
[1:37:52] <Yummy_Nukes> big ol future garbage truck
[1:37:53] <+JohnRSoviet> the fact that the civilian version is called an "oliphant" always tickled me
[1:38:10] <DatAsuna> Like to galaxy is an amazing track but the game uses it in a super wasteful scene and only half the song
[1:38:10] <%Dean_Inbetween> @johnrsoviet its not a bad soundtrack by any means its just its completely different in tone and marty is hard to match
[1:38:11] <razieltano123> Bravo six. Going dark
[1:38:12] <+condemned_15> What kinda name is Soap?
[1:38:14] <%D00msDayDan> quick woolie, load up a halo 3 match so you know what an elephant is
[1:38:22] <DatAsuna> So the bit where the song really HITS never even plays
[1:38:30] <Halospaz117> 4 also has a great remix of Never Forget from 3
[1:38:30] <DSD24> "How'd a muppet like you pass inspection?"
[1:38:32] <%Dean_Inbetween> @datasuna hmm that’s actually really interesting now that you put it that way
[1:38:34] <pfctwinkletoes> I love the sandtrap elephants
[1:38:37] <brachydios777> You need a shot of whiskey before doing a Price impression
[1:38:38] <%ZeroCruz> The elephant is super dumb tho
[1:38:39] <+BigBlackBankai> Just the wind...
[1:38:44] <DatAsuna> Which is crazy cause it's a rad song when you just listen to it as a track

[1:38:54] <Tuna_Can_0> if its space debris, don't think you'd have time to think that
[1:38:59] <DatAsuna> However halo 5 OST sucks
[1:39:02] <Yummy_Nukes> I've always liked the west midlands because it sounds like a pirate accent
[1:39:02] <DSD24> "Switching to your pistol is always faster than reloading"
[1:39:03] <+JohnRSoviet> @Dean_Inbetween there are still some tracks from 4 that I think are pretty awesome, 117 and Arrival come to mind
[1:39:07] <DatAsuna> The only good song is the first one you hear
[1:39:12] <%slimmixrp> Sniper can one shot on a hand no?
[1:39:15] <%D00msDayDan> halo 4 and 5 each had like two good tracks and the rest is boring score
[1:39:17] <%slimmixrp> Maybe I am the fool
[1:39:17] <DatAsuna> Light is Green
[1:39:24] <DatAsuna> And even Light is Green is still very...
[1:39:31] <DatAsuna> knock-off o'donnel
[1:39:31] <%Dean_Inbetween> @johnrsoviet yes that is true its just not as prominent as previous osts
[1:39:37] <+BigBlackBankai> Plasma will drop the shield.
[1:39:40] <DatAsuna> Halo 4 at least has a distinct sound
[1:39:44] <%stayinthepocket> On your feet soldier we are leaving!
[1:39:51] <$BallerSwagBro9k> COUGH PAT COUGH
[1:39:52] <%Dean_Inbetween> Infinite seems to be returning to what halo osts were
[1:39:55] <DatAsuna> but 5 feels like an imitation of other soundtracks
[1:40:06] <+RahuHordika> how the hell did that miss
[1:40:09] <%D00msDayDan> the only track between halo 4 and 5 that stood out to me during gameplay was mantis
[1:40:10] <%Dean_Inbetween> 5 is generic movie ost
[1:40:13] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Halo soundtracks after Reach LUL
[1:40:14] <+RahuHordika> I saw the reticle right on it
[1:40:17] <DatAsuna> mantis is rad
[1:40:18] <brachydios777> @dean_inbetween That walk in the woods remix is very good
[1:40:28] <RickSaintRiot> wha happun'd to halo post-reach, man
[1:40:33] <DatAsuna> Awakening is probably my fave halo 4 track
[1:40:37] <+condemned_15> passed it
[1:40:39] <%ZeroCruz> Basically play line Vergil and legendary is a joke
[1:40:40] <RamenRiderZ> 343 happun
[1:40:41] <%doomerskeletor13> @ricksaintriot Chief blew it up
[1:40:42] <+Detectivemac9> @RickSaintRiot a complete change of developer what u want
[1:40:43] <%Dean_Inbetween> @brachydios777 I FUCKING LOVED IT, i got so happy when i got to the 2 minute mark
[1:40:44] <digitalslime> he stubed his toe on it
[1:40:50] <DatAsuna> badass piano in awakening
[1:40:51] <DSD24> @RickSaintRiot new devs right?
[1:40:55] <+mybigmeech> Halo 4's soundtrack is more generic. However, it's version of never forget is probably my favourite
[1:40:59] <RickSaintRiot> I want Halo, thats what i want
[1:41:02] <subjectg> my favorite underrated h4 track would probably be that one droning promethean combat track in spartan ops, actually
[1:41:06] <+JohnRSoviet> good ol' Bio-foam
[1:41:07] <omicronalpharius> That's basically a plot line in The Pacific and Band of Brothers at several points V
[1:41:09] <%krispen_wa> BIOFOAM
[1:41:09] <DatAsuna> More generic than 5? You're nuts
[1:41:17] <RickSaintRiot> Yeah, 343, but were there really no Bungie devs who stayed on?
[1:41:18] <+RahuHordika> oh it's this level
[1:41:19] <%Dean_Inbetween> Halo 4s never forget legitimately got me
[1:41:24] <+Aeoneth> So how does the Rookie know that as a flashback?
[1:41:27] <DigitalJoshie> *sounds of death*
[1:41:31] <%a_goth_pancake> biofoam suuuuucks
[1:41:31] <DSD24> Medical Spray!
[1:41:34] <SpaceGuntank> lorewise biofoam is cool how it works lore wise
[1:41:35] <brachydios777> Aren’t we pretty close to biofoam irl
[1:41:35] <subjectg> didact’s theme is also a unique flavor
[1:41:36] <+mundanelotus> What other characters have they done this session?
[1:41:49] <%D00msDayDan> if only rookie woke up an hour earlier
[1:41:52] <Nomad94> @mundanelotus Romeo, Dutch
[1:41:54] <subjectg> @mundanelotus alpha site and nmpd hq today
[1:41:55] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Okay but why didn't they use the canister right away?
[1:41:57] <%Dean_Inbetween> I do legitimately love the creepy forrunner chanting in 4
[1:42:02] <+jiggy_snipe> D:
[1:42:04] <+JohnRSoviet> There is some IRL biofoam tech in development
[1:42:07] <RickSaintRiot> presumably Rookie's either making a deduction, or Vergil is playing the recording back
[1:42:08] <%Dean_Inbetween> Its very haunting
[1:42:08] <%cobalt_phoenix_> fuck punctured lung sounds awful
[1:42:11] <+mundanelotus> Thank you!
[1:42:13] <Nomad94> just plug him right up
[1:42:13] <$BallerSwagBro9k> dayum
[1:42:13] <%a_goth_pancake> juuuust missed em.
[1:42:22] <%D00msDayDan> good thing they hiked him all the way down there before using biofoam on him
[1:42:28] <%TheEpicTree> They didn't do this before??
[1:42:29] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1313474077307396101?s=19
[1:42:29] <DianaTheAscian> what does that do exactly?
[1:42:32] <+jiggy_snipe> lol
[1:42:40] <wintrysoma> so apparently rookie's escapades don't take very long because the reunion occurs fairly shortly after this
[1:42:40] <+jiggy_snipe> yea wtf, why did they wait so long?
[1:42:44] <Nomad94> @DianaTheAscian plug up the lung hole
[1:42:45] <%D00msDayDan> @DianaTheAscian holds your organs intact until you can get some proper medical attention
[1:42:46] <FreedomARX7> it sealed his lung
[1:42:53] <DianaTheAscian> k thx
[1:42:55] <+That1blindkid> its just plugging a hole not really healing
[1:42:55] <Yummy_Nukes> it's the future!
[1:42:57] <DSD24> Take a look at THIS
[1:43:02] <Tuna_Can_0> but its probably full of super glue WutFace
[1:43:04] <brachydios777> Biofoam is really good
[1:43:07] <RickSaintRiot> it's forest! oh my GOD
[1:43:08] <%a_goth_pancake> it hurts like a bitch tho
[1:43:09] <%cobalt_phoenix_> is biofoam just flexseal
[1:43:09] <+JVolfram> Romeo's too much of a smart ass to die
[1:43:19] <%Irridium> I mean he was breathing fine beforehand so maybe they were just saving it for when they really needed it
[1:43:19] <+Idziman> SPACE DRUGS
[1:43:23] <+JustToWatch> it was uhh nanomachines
[1:43:27] <+JohnRSoviet> Sci-Fi biofoam, it'll cure what ails ya
[1:43:29] <Invertin> it's future medicine it's fine
[1:43:29] <%a_goth_pancake> "you better come take a look at this" cliche
[1:43:38] <kylejburke> now if the last one was the best music level, this is the best gameplay level
[1:43:41] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> There’s a whole in my fucking lung, dear ‘Liza, dear ‘Liza.
[1:43:41] <+yhom_tork> PogChamp

[1:44:11] <chainsaw105> sticky for mickey
[1:44:12] <SpaceGuntank> biofoam wont fix that LUL
[1:44:13] <subjectg> good start
[1:44:16] <brachydios777> t101Oof
[1:44:17] <%a_goth_pancake> oh sure Mel would make Wash fly the alien ship.
[1:44:20] <RickSaintRiot> Halo predicted fentanyl wowie
[1:44:29] <+JohnRSoviet> just spray some biofoam on the chunks
[1:44:36] <+mundanelotus> Ahhhh
[1:44:55] <%D00msDayDan> shotgun is NOT ok at at distance, optimal range is melee lunge range
[1:44:58] <%Irridium> LUL
[1:44:59] <TigerClaws12> LUL

[1:45:15] <%cobalt_phoenix_> i fuckin love this guy
[1:45:17] <%a_goth_pancake> I just realized Nathan had a demotion.
[1:45:22] <stormhawk9891> Optimal shotgun range is kissing distance
[1:45:26] <%doomerskeletor13> Good old Buck
[1:45:45] <Manjove> optimal shotgun range is the length of the barrel
[1:45:45] <RamenRiderZ> Whoa nelly
[1:45:45] <+mybigmeech> an explosive shotgun
[1:46:01] <%D00msDayDan> maybe close the distance instead of plinking well past effective range
[1:46:05] <%doomerskeletor13> brownS don’t freeze
[1:46:06] <RickSaintRiot> my weapons: tiny shotgun, fast shotgun, normal shotgun, and far-shotgun
[1:46:09] <digitalslime> this part co op sucks
[1:46:13] <sniffy77> mickey is not fine
[1:46:14] <%a_goth_pancake> I always wondered what the point of the silenced guns was if they still alerted every enemy in the zone anyway.
[1:46:33] <digitalslime> respawn is all weird
[1:46:38] <razieltano123> He is stuck
[1:46:42] <+CommunistSpacecrabs> mickey pls

[1:46:48] <%doomerskeletor13> I believe in you Alan Tudyk
[1:46:52] <%Dean_Inbetween> I mean the actual answer is because bungie thinks its cool @a_goth_pancake
[1:46:52] <subjectg> give mickey a hand
[1:46:55] <trackles_64> micky bugged out
[1:46:59] <digitalslime> help micky
[1:47:00] <razieltano123> @WoolieVersus Mikey is stuk.
[1:47:06] <DSD24> @a_goth_pancake I mean they still work a little bit when enemies don't know where you at at
[1:47:14] <+That1blindkid> i just realized this is a redo of the song that plays in the first sniping level of halo 1
[1:47:22] <%Dean_Inbetween> Huh really

[1:50:15] <RickSaintRiot> why do the Brutes not simply eat the other covenant
[1:50:17] <subjectg> i’ve never been able to confirm, but did they allow you to hover in the banshee just for odst?

[1:54:49] <MajoraZ> @WoolieVersus is it safe to say that the crash last stream wasn't actually due to the audio log then?

[1:57:52] <bearwagon> wheres that guy in chat
[1:57:53] <@Menitta> was the coffee good?
[1:57:53] <RickSaintRiot> "by American standards" is pretty key
[1:57:55] <%stayinthepocket> That dude definitely has a tiny cock
[1:57:58] <TheHastySlowpoke> But really though, clown college is expensive. So I’m not sure it’s worth it, given the current crisis.
[1:58:03] <dinnydanny777> Yeah but American standards are American standards
[1:58:07] <Explodincatz> its ok American standards are super low

[1:58:41] <RickSaintRiot> honestly, besides Slavic countries, are there more rw countries besides USA?

[2:01:03] <%D00msDayDan> those videos are stealing views from the original
[2:01:03] <DigitalJoshie> not on mobile tho

[2:01:39] <Manjove> refresh, oh look more anti trump insanity
[2:01:39] <%Mr_Strut> Self righteous anger is the best
[2:01:42] <dinnydanny777> It's called outrage fatigue and sometimes it's done on purpose
[2:01:45] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @FuqBoiSlim fuck how did i not think of that
[2:01:51] <%krispen_wa> LUL
[2:02:00] <MichaelDood> damn
[2:02:00] <+Shotgundam009> I can't stop looking at the on going train wreck of twitter
[2:02:01] <%SirGO0SE> Doomscrolling JUST TO FEEL
[2:02:09] <%stayinthepocket> Anger and frustration and sadness are emotions
[2:02:10] <Tuna_Can_0> FeelsBadMan feel nothing
[2:02:15] <dreadedcthulhu> the worst part is when even the things you like have bad shut surrounding them
[2:02:15] <%FuqBoiSlim> @cobalt_phoenix_ been listening the the hajime no ippo on loop since Sunday
[2:02:15] <andrewofbob> Doomscrolling is self harm
[2:02:21] <kikoeru_san> a 3rd fucking sync

[2:02:27] <%D00msDayDan> slitting your virtual wrists
[2:02:27] <$phd_in_thuggery> DOOMSCROLLING TO BURY THE LIGHT
[2:02:28] <dreadedcthulhu> *gestures vaguely toward magic the gathering*
[2:02:28] <dinnydanny777> I believe it's actively a plan to instil outrage fatigue in people so that they become apathetic
[2:02:31] <RickSaintRiot> doomscrolling is self-care, compared to actually being angry
[2:02:33] <Tuna_Can_0> horny is an alternative emotion
[2:02:37] <jorniev> CHEMICALS IN BRAIN CAST
[2:02:38] <%TitaniumDragoonNeo> "Getting Really V" would be a great podcast.
[2:02:39] <DigitalJoshie> the stress that doomscrolling cause can shorten your life
[2:02:43] <%Dean_Inbetween> I actively can’t it gives me so much stress and depression Im a big politcal science nerd

[2:03:01] <%Dean_Inbetween> Twitter fucking hurts my dna
[2:03:01] <subjectg> @dreadedcthulhu boy that secret lair, huh?
[2:03:05] <T_Sasquatch> This is why i only follow friends , artists and pornstars
[2:03:06] <MajoraZ> Uhhhhhhh
[2:03:10] <%Irridium> no fucking idea
[2:03:10] <DemonicHoward> they have destriptiosn
[2:03:10] <MajoraZ> either the first or second
[2:03:12] <%stayinthepocket> You know what's annoying? When people call hunger an emotion. That shit isn't an emotion.
[2:03:15] <%D00msDayDan> probably still alpha, you were at the beginning of the mission
[2:03:19] <Yummy_Nukes> the rally point is yo mama
[2:03:19] <jorniev> HALO KIWAMI
[2:03:28] <RickSaintRiot> yeah hungry is not an emotional state
[2:03:29] <%D00msDayDan> rally points have descriptions i'm pretty sure
[2:03:30] <chainsaw105> alpha is basically mission start
[2:03:32] <digitalslime> 1 or 2, you aren't far
[2:03:34] <DemonicHoward> maybe bravo
[2:03:38] <%a_goth_pancake> alpha.
[2:03:38] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:03:43] <Nomad94> @stayinthepocket is hangry an emotion?
[2:03:53] <RickSaintRiot> But there's a continuum between physiological and emotional states
[2:03:55] <dinnydanny777> Being hungry puts me in an emotional state
[2:03:55] <%cobalt_phoenix_> why not start 2 and if it's too far go back to 1
[2:03:57] <dreadedcthulhu> @subjectg can't wat for them to print secret lair Gotham with a new legacy legal sol ring that taps for 4
[2:04:03] <@Menitta> you can eat out of spite
[2:04:08] <mellorolo> doom scrolling happens because people are too lax in my opinion or exercise their coping mechanisms unhealthly
[2:04:09] <Bonesmasher43> 4 :)
[2:04:12] <RickSaintRiot> being hungry will make you angry or sad, and vice versa

[2:05:09] <puluxor> Every game definitely improves on its predecessor, but it's a very slow, incremental improvement.
[2:05:11] <subjectg> @dreadedcthulhu secret lair marvel, color-specific black lotuses themed after the infinity stones
[2:05:15] <%a_goth_pancake> got in, got out. good for them.
[2:05:19] <sleepy_pink> looked into that coffee brand and they're like. bad. transphobic and NRA supporters
[2:05:27] <ELO_Gambit> is that the man V mills!?
[2:05:35] <TheHastySlowpoke> The jazz game hath returned
[2:05:38] <dinnydanny777> I still can't believe they made 3 Takens
[2:05:41] <chainsaw105> we do it!
[2:05:45] <AppleBerryKitty> hot damn its dark
[2:05:47] <%a_goth_pancake> transphobes DansGame
[2:05:50] <Ninjalettuce> @sleepy_pink Fuckn yikes
[2:06:03] <%Dean_Inbetween> I think bungie was starting to fade with reach still even though reach was great

[2:06:28] <%Dean_Inbetween> Reach was starting to follow trends even though bungie always made them
[2:06:30] <Yummy_Nukes> like the good book says!
[2:06:35] <sleepy_pink> as much as I enjoy drinking liberal tears, it's not worth supporting folks like that
[2:06:51] <%a_goth_pancake> also, lol the company called "black rifle" supports the NRA? whaaaaaat?
[2:06:56] <wintrysoma> bungie has this one quasi-mystical scifi story that they just keep telling over and over
[2:06:57] <RickSaintRiot> they're probably fine. it's the ppl they cater to you want to be wary of
[2:07:14] <sleepy_pink> no it's like all over their website
[2:07:14] <%Dean_Inbetween> @wintrysoma it started with marathon
[2:07:39] <+thesw1tch> *SPOILERS* you can see mace windus body fall from one of the buildings at the beginning of that sequence
[2:07:42] <%D00msDayDan> yeah i played some of marathon recently and halo ce might as well have been called marathon solid
[2:07:43] <SCIENCE_25> The SMG looks so good in this game.
[2:07:49] <RickSaintRiot> The Senate must decide his fate
[2:08:07] <sniffy77> no
[2:08:12] <liphttam1> they legs 2 short
[2:08:12] <Explodincatz> never
[2:08:13] <sleepy_pink> the smg is like a better assault rifle
[2:08:16] <chainsaw105> no they're too little
[2:08:17] <sleepy_pink> in this game at least
[2:08:27] <%Dean_Inbetween> @d00msdaydan and marathon is just metal gear 1 metal gear 2 solid snake and a hypothetical metal gear 3
[2:08:30] <brachydios777> Nope
[2:08:31] <subjectg> backpacks too thick
[2:08:35] <Yummy_Nukes> grunts aren't prestigious enough to fly
[2:08:44] <digitalslime> oof
[2:08:47] <RickSaintRiot> marathon is just running really far, idek what's the big deal
[2:08:57] <%Dean_Inbetween> The grunts only pilot ghosts and turrets the covenant wont let them drive anything else
[2:09:03] <dinnydanny777> Is this City flooded?
[2:09:10] <%a_goth_pancake> yes
[2:09:14] <subjectg> station’s flooded
[2:09:15] <%Dean_Inbetween> @ricksaintriot Jebaited
[2:09:53] <%a_goth_pancake> I'd call this a city before a station, it's massive
[2:10:18] <%Dean_Inbetween> Time to get the scarab gun
[2:10:20] <%Dean_Inbetween> Oh wait
[2:10:23] <%Dean_Inbetween> Kappa

[2:10:42] <Nomad94> It won't fit, step-Sergeant
[2:10:42] <%a_goth_pancake> halo 5 has a scarab gun DarkMode

[2:11:58] <brachydios777> I don’t get it
[2:11:58] <andrewofbob> Time for 3rd Strike

[2:12:06] <%stayinthepocket> Mustard race
[2:12:08] <RamenRiderZ> Im back, did it freeze again?
[2:12:13] <DSD24> Yes it did
[2:12:13] <DianaTheAscian> yup
[2:12:14] <+number_1_ninja> Yep
[2:12:16] <RamenRiderZ> Damn
[2:12:17] <Yummy_Nukes> @woolieversus must be the weather
[2:12:23] <Second_Omega> Idk what’s caused this, me and my Mates never had a single glitch?
[2:12:24] <chainsaw105> yeah that's weird. I never got crashes this often. only once at the police station
[2:12:25] <%a_goth_pancake> is it the game, obs, and twitch all trying to run at once? maybe record off twitch?
[2:12:26] <digitalslime> ya frezze
[2:12:26] <+BurkeBigsby> Might be a MP issue. Never got freezing on Single player.
[2:12:27] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh man
[2:12:28] <RickSaintRiot> Musta' been the wind
[2:12:33] <%liphttam1> idk check the game cache
[2:12:34] <%D00msDayDan> you'll need the xbone for halo 5 anyway
[2:12:34] <RickSaintRiot> Musta' been nothin'
[2:12:36] <Nomad94> this is such a bummer
[2:12:39] <%ZeroCruz> Then just do it solo?
[2:12:39] <Nomad94> we're so close
[2:12:44] <%Irridium> The All In One Entertainment Device from Microsoft
[2:12:47] <%Irridium> yes it is
[2:12:49] <MajoraZ> Yes, it's got local co-op
[2:12:49] <+Catpurrple> I had crashes in Halo 2 co-op with cutscenes, and that was bad enough because I had to skip them all with my friend just to finish, but these are crashes in the middle of gameplay too.
[2:12:50] <DigitalJoshie> yes
[2:12:51] <MajoraZ> on xbox
[2:12:53] <%D00msDayDan> yes xbone has splitscreen on all games
[2:13:05] <RickSaintRiot> the xbane of our existence
[2:13:09] <%mitchteck> Yes
[2:13:13] <digitalslime> up to 2 player co op on xbox
[2:13:23] <%cobalt_phoenix_> just wait for an update Kappa
[2:13:24] <%ZeroCruz> Solo?
[2:13:26] <%a_goth_pancake> splitscreeeeeeeeen
[2:13:30] <leomuratore> it's rough
[2:13:32] <%Lion_kun> Reminds me of the Omikron Days.
[2:13:43] <%Pinkiefan> Bad port?
[2:13:45] <chainsaw105> might just be better off waiting till next week maybe
[2:13:45] <andrewofbob> @catpurrple Those are some ballers cutscenes you were forced off.
[2:13:52] <+BurkeBigsby> Base Xbone atpRtsd atpRtsd4
[2:13:57] <%RyTYoung> The Nomad Soul, what a bad subtitle
[2:14:01] <KnivesEve> who ported these games?
[2:14:07] <Nomad94> @RyTYoung You rang?
[2:14:09] <MajoraZ> @WoolieVersus you can just play it spolo on V's machine, maybe? since the crashing seems to be just on your pc?
[2:14:09] <IntenseNerdRage> Just push through ut woolie
[2:14:10] <@Solidus_113> Switching to XBone would also be quick to play Halo 4 and 5
[2:14:12] <leomuratore> 300 updates in line
[2:14:17] <IntenseNerdRage> You've done it before
[2:14:18] <Chatterbox1991> According to one guy on Discord the Xbone version of MCC isnt having these problems @WoolieVersus
[2:14:21] <%stayinthepocket> Lol that would be a MASSIVE update then
[2:14:25] <%a_goth_pancake> that's years.
[2:14:29] <kikoeru_san> No fucking way
[2:14:31] <kikoeru_san> again
[2:14:34] <+Catpurrple> @andrewofbob I know, it sucks. I got to see them because I'm the halo fan and played it solo a couple times, but my friend didn't.
[2:14:34] <MmmokayByron> Probably should have done it just in case this would have happened
[2:14:37] <Second_Omega> XBone of my sword
[2:14:39] <leomuratore> Split screen on V's machine?
[2:14:40] <puluxor> 'S coo.
[2:14:41] <kikoeru_san> I'm so sorry woolie
[2:14:43] <%cobalt_phoenix_> it iiiiis what it iiiiis
[2:14:45] <SpartanSeventyEight> No need to apologise, it's out of your control like you said
[2:14:50] <kikoeru_san> pc has no split screen
[2:14:57] <%ZeroCruz> BibleThump
[2:15:00] <nxflre> that could be an issue yeah someone loads faster causing issues
[2:15:02] <%a_goth_pancake> it's k

[2:15:53] <Second_Omega> 3rd crash
[2:15:53] <%Irridium> could try verifying the steam cache if on Steam?
[2:15:55] <%cobalt_phoenix_> yea

[2:16:09] <%a_goth_pancake> yeah, try verifying
[2:16:11] <kikoeru_san> yo I dodged all this shit
[2:16:15] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @kikoeru_san beta testing the rollback tomorrow
[2:16:16] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @mdkcde Now that Microsoft and Bethesda have teamed up were guaranteed quality products LUL
[2:16:20] <digitalslime> sorry woolie has to play this game with so many issues

[2:17:00] <%HaloPlayerNamedJohn> The Halo 3 odst insider testing had the worst turn out of testers
[2:17:02] <+DazedCookies> :)
[2:17:03] <kikoeru_san> Wait @reverend_roscoe they're putting rollback into XIII
[2:17:15] <%D00msDayDan> this LP will slow to a crawl if woolie goes solo
[2:17:15] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @dreadedcthulhu ill fight you
[2:17:29] <+JustToWatch> Oh wait I figured out how to fix it (last post in thread)
[2:17:43] <Yummy_Nukes> i still think it's just the weather Kappa
[2:17:44] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:17:51] <%Irridium> "nvm guys I found the fix" - last posted 3 years ago
[2:17:52] <DianaTheAscian> @D00msDayDan not if he plays it on easy
[2:17:52] <%a_goth_pancake> if it helps, I can confirm I've played 30 hours single player and haven't crashed.
[2:17:53] <%Navekraith> Would now be a good time to catch up on Audio Logs?
[2:18:00] <chainsaw105> could it possibly be due to the weather maybe?
[2:18:08] <%a_goth_pancake> I have it installed on HDD.
[2:18:13] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @kikoeru_san I don't know anything about that, but code mystics is putting rollback into 2002 UM and the beta test is currently underway on Steam
[2:18:23] <+jiggy_snipe> the weather thing could be legit if it's a networking thing
[2:18:23] <DianaTheAscian> how???
[2:18:28] <Explodincatz> my anecdote: played solo didnt have crashes
[2:18:32] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[2:18:33] <+jiggy_snipe> true lol
[2:18:37] <+jiggy_snipe> nevermind
[2:18:37] <digitalslime> talk about kof rollback
[2:18:38] <%cobalt_phoenix_> weren't the last session crashes from audio logs tho
[2:18:40] <+Catpurrple> If the stream itself went down with the game crashes, then you'd have something there.
[2:18:47] <andrewofbob> There’s ethernet, and then there’s local internet
[2:18:48] <+JustToWatch> could be angry wizards

[2:25:14] <RamenRiderZ> How is it on Switch?
[2:25:22] <weegion29> switch port is good
[2:25:23] <KnivesEve> i got it on switch
[2:25:25] <+wydamn> Hades is good on the switch, as long as you're okay with no mouse
[2:25:25] <%Reverend_Roscoe> KOF PREVIEW
[2:25:27] <DianaTheAscian> i need stuff for my switch
[2:25:31] <@Menitta> I know a bunch of people on the discord are playing it a ton on Switch
[2:25:44] <+wydamn> I have had Hades crash on me on switch a couple times tho
[2:25:51] <DatAsuna> me and xcom
[2:26:01] <%tkfromthe90s> tkfromthe90s subscribed with Twitch Prime.
[2:26:16] <DatAsuna> Eh, a successful raid won't take over an hour
[2:26:21] <%mitchteck> Dude hades crashed on me after I beat the bull and spear guy boss when that thing launched it was awful
[2:26:25] <DatAsuna> The bigger issue with raids is schedule, not length
[2:26:25] <%cobalt_phoenix_> "just one more run" "ok let's see what everyone has to say" "ok I probably have time for one more" and repeat
