[1:05:35] <+OneGorillionDollars> The seals that contain woolie slowly crumble
[1:05:38] <%caffienatedjedi> @Superdandy96 They get at least one of the best items in the game if they beat the Darkling.
[1:05:38] <%TheOneUpWarrior> yo
[1:05:50] <%Superdandy96> @yeetdabsenpai69 WOW
[1:05:51] <%emperordread> Reggie pulled some 4th Hokage and used the seal no jutsu to trap in the 9 tails
[1:05:54] <Zourath> At this point he's pretty much guaranteed a castle steal at the very least.
[1:05:55] <crimsonsaens> Minh's plays are as wack as Reggie's
[1:05:55] <%nintega010> @Superdandy96 that is very hard. you need like the best class and charge and be a high level
[1:05:56] <%purplehermit12> @caffienatedjedi yeah but the only way for them to beat that is counter.

[1:06:26] <+moink1234> Is reggie still in 1st? Please tell me that reggie is still in 1st
[1:06:27] <%caffienatedjedi> @purplehermit12 Right now, yeah. Once they get to mid-late game it becomes more viable to win against darkling.
[1:06:32] <+paladinstarbuster> Yes
[1:06:32] <+pectusumbra> worst case, Woolie can just take another go at darkling in another few weeks after the economy is fucking dead
[1:06:36] <Paul_Cheenis_Big_Beenis> The righteous protagonist has sealed the vile evil
[1:06:39] <+moink1234> Awesome
[1:06:39] <%Superdandy96> The Hype when Reggie beats Darklington Kappa
[1:06:44] <+Target616> I think its 2-3 vanishes needed to last an entire darkling run
[1:06:47] <Xeno351> minh should make a deal with woolie to use the mattock
[1:06:55] <crossing_mao> Remember when everyone and their mother was saying Mihn would be 1st Darkling?
[1:06:57] <+Deft_Thought> Can you use the Soul Mop to remove Darkling?
[1:06:58] <+soFISHticated98> think he sold it
[1:07:01] <%jiggy_snipe> if Woolie doesn't cause COMPLETE GLOBAL SATURATION, he
[1:07:03] <+kekkerscrew> hopefully someone clipped Reggie the hero Sealing the vial demon

[1:36:00] <+waltzqueen> PogChamp
[1:36:01] <%SuperKirby24> 10 more monkaS
[1:36:01] <%Th3SmartAlec> Woolie you get Castle or Global
[1:36:02] <$Rezca> He can wait it out
[1:36:02] <%agumon9000> You can always steal a castle
[1:36:02] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> It's happening.
[1:36:03] <%jiggy_snipe> go take Danube
[1:36:03] <+soFISHticated98> can't wait to see how much Woolie levels
[1:36:05] <%yeetdabsenpai69> GLOBAL ASSAULT
[1:36:05] <+keiththehuman> SAFE
[1:36:10] <+Grayhammatter> GLOBAL saturation
[1:36:10] <GKannel> castle is harder to get back
[1:36:12] <+tearfuldevil> just play wooly

[1:36:27] <Malik1002> you should have used it and played with the 100
[1:36:33] <DerpioParty> Two more rolls, but it would have to be two 0s or a 0 and a 5
[1:36:33] <dastmwolf> just take another castle youll be right back in the game
[1:36:34] <ManlyMcBeefington> Castle is more long term gain damage
[1:36:35] <Spydurman> worst case scenario he gets another castle
[1:36:36] <yodajr99> woolie you can get 5 twice and still have it
[1:36:44] <+aishman> Naw I disagree Malik, the castle was real good
[1:36:45] <$Rezca> oh wait, does he transform back at 1 or 0?
[1:36:48] <%neraren> YOu JUST have to avoid 0s
[1:36:49] <C4m3r0n0409> 0
[1:36:52] <+aishman> At 0
[1:36:55] <%nothuzad> you have 3 turns not 1

[1:45:40] <+pectusumbra> time to climb the mountain minh
[1:45:41] <%agumon9000> Mountain!
[1:45:45] <%nintega010> @viewtifulr he has no equipment to break
[1:45:49] <yeildingthought> Mountain
[1:45:54] <C4m3r0n0409> why
[1:45:58] <%jiggy_snipe> why
[1:45:58] <%fuji_92> LUL
[1:45:59] <+Dimfish> mountain would be a bad move before the town scramble
[1:46:02] <%invisi_bliss> LUL
[1:46:02] <%Plus_On_Black> Woolie should have been fighting these guys
[1:46:04] <BreakersAweigh> LUL
[1:46:04] <DerpioParty> A CASTLE IS FINE TOO
[1:46:06] <%jiggy_snipe> a castle is still great lol
[1:46:07] <%Th3SmartAlec> Woolie you can always get a castle
[1:46:08] <+therabbles> brace for failure
[1:46:09] <%yeetdabsenpai69> YOUVE GOT THIS DARKLINgTON
[1:46:09] <%GenesisKnight> Nice dodge
[1:46:12] <%lotharrio> Woolie, you should have summoned them in much earlier.
[1:46:17] <%jiggy_snipe> do they not understand the value of castles?
[1:46:18] <SethKyu> I hope woolie gets 200 on the dark spinner
[1:46:19] <%fuji_92> EITHER A NUKE OR A CASTLE WOOLS
[1:46:20] <%emperordread> Woolie will get auto countered on next dark arts point spinner LUL
[1:46:20] <%SuperKirby24> JUST BELIEVE IN YOURSELF
[1:46:21] <goose_attack_almanac> Woolie shoulda dragged them to him while he was in the roadblock
[1:46:25] <%fuji_92> IT'S IN THE BAG
[1:46:26] <irfan_> barely killed, damn
[1:46:29] <%NecDW4> So... bets on woolie putting a controller through the wall if he rolls a zero?
[1:46:30] <Idon__> Griffith: I... simply follwed my dream.
[1:46:31] <%viewtifulr> @nintega010 when dark mode is over weapons are retained so theres that part to clear what i ment
[1:46:31] <Spydurman> Woolie's inner balance is lost
[1:46:34] <+soFISHticated98> Minh had a billion warps
[1:46:38] <%neraren> No bet
[1:46:41] <+IxDomxI> are your actions those of justice?
[1:46:44] <%purplehermit12> minh had 8 billlion warps and reggie was vanished
[1:46:45] <%xcompleasedad> @NecDW4 Too likely
[1:46:46] <+soFISHticated98> there was no point to trapping them behind a roadblock
[1:46:47] <Mr_Strut> Woolie got the calm fury
[1:46:47] <%nintega010> @viewtifulr ahh ok
[1:46:49] <%purplehermit12> Come here would have done nothing
[1:46:50] <+MrAtheGreat> The sun always rises tomorrow.
[1:46:50] <%fetrigon> Reggie it's a black hole
[1:46:51] <WhiteTetsu> everyone aavoided fighting him
[1:46:51] <+soFISHticated98> they wouldn't be trapped
[1:46:52] <%SchwaAkari> Watch him roll a 200 at the last second and have no way to use all the points
[1:46:52] <+Invlux> ! Balance at Risk !
[1:46:55] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[1:46:55] <$Rezca> the safety

[2:17:24] <%SchwaAkari> Are we gonna see Minh climb the mountain?? Heaven is the one area of the game I have never seen
[2:17:24] <Shinny1338> he just bought a bunch of items
[2:17:28] <WhiteTetsu> mountain takes to long with towns free
[2:17:41] <C4m3r0n0409> WHY
[2:17:45] <C4m3r0n0409> YOU HAVE NOTHING
[2:17:48] <$Rezca> business opportunities
[2:17:55] <%SchwaAkari> Racing for the towns is probably the smarter choice
[2:18:02] <%jiggy_snipe> go make the King love you Reggie
[2:18:04] <%SchwaAkari> At least some of them
[2:18:05] <Gramcracker55> they let you get to a secret area.
[2:18:07] <C4m3r0n0409> Get more towns dude
[2:18:10] <crimsonsaens> The value of the towns in the south are actually pretty high value
[2:18:12] <dastmwolf> PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt
[2:18:16] <+pectusumbra> Minh, you WANT to do that
[2:18:32] <SethKyu> To invest, you have to be at the castle
[2:18:33] <%nintega010> the mountain will be for later
[2:18:39] <SethKyu> Can't do it from the bank
[2:18:40] <+Gespens> Guys, he doesn't have the requirements for the BRAVE
[2:18:42] <%SchwaAkari> After that you can use the Spring Cave to hurriedly get back to the south continent (though I doubt any of them know what Spring Cave does, still)
[2:18:46] <%fuji_92> I'm rooting for Woolie because chat's a booli PunOko
[2:19:02] <+soFISHticated98> Woolie was a smug ass bitch in the beginning
[2:19:03] <Shinny1338> isn't the wings for all classes mastered first?
[2:19:08] <crimsonsaens> Hero requirements are nutty, he can get good equipment on the mountain though
[2:19:08] <Gramcracker55> there is good equipment at the top of the mountain but I'm not sure if it's worth the effort.
[2:19:10] <Klefth> They're all preeetty far from the wings stuff
[2:19:11] <yodajr99> woolie or reggie minh must lose
[2:19:11] <+Gespens> Red Chest!

[2:23:44] <+InfiniteHav0k> this is so funny tbh

[2:53:06] <%SchwaAkari> This one's weaker and doesn't have boss music
[2:53:09] <TheHardM> It lasts for like, two or three days.
[2:53:10] <%SchwaAkari> I don't think it has a Royal Ring
[2:53:11] <C4m3r0n0409> OH FUCK
[2:53:12] <NeroInfinite> it's BUFF
[2:53:12] <VexicBayn> yikes
[2:53:14] <+MrAtheGreat> m guard
[2:53:14] <+Grayhammatter> OH FUCK
[2:53:16] <+pectusumbra> Woolie's weapon is just really bad
[2:53:21] <%nintega010> He needs a new weapon
[2:53:21] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Shit
[2:53:24] <%purplehermit12> Woolie has shit gear
[2:53:25] <%jiggy_snipe> Woolie has bad equipment
[2:53:25] <%ChoculaUltra> c h i l l e r
[2:53:30] <%nothuzad> all of them underestimating magic
[2:53:32] <haisho> Woolie in desperate need of better gear
[2:53:33] <%yeetdabsenpai69> GET NEW WEAPON YOU WEAK
[2:53:34] <Ultimatefool> Good thing Woolie is a TANK
[2:53:37] <%JeoDood> woolie has bad gear
[2:53:38] <%purplehermit12> Reggie needs better defensive magic
[2:53:38] <DiscoDur0> Next chapter, should shop for a hot weapon
[2:53:40] <bursky00> woolie has no attack
[2:53:40] <VexicBayn> fuckin Gearless Woolie tonight
[2:53:44] <TheHardM> Just get better defensive magic.
[2:53:46] <C4m3r0n0409> WOOLIE IS WEAK AF
[2:53:48] <WhiteTetsu> it the cold
[2:53:51] <%yeknomlive> cold squares para you
[2:53:52] <DiscoDur0> Snow space
[2:53:52] <%Superdandy96> Woolie’s bad equipment has come to screw him over!
[2:53:52] <SethKyu> Nah, it's the snow
[2:53:52] <%yeetdabsenpai69> no it's the cold
[2:53:54] <Junkles> snow wihout warm gloves = paralysis
[2:53:55] <crimsonsaens> Paralysis just happens from snowy areas
[2:54:00] <+Grayhammatter> town warps mihn
[2:54:00] <WhiteTetsu> no warm gloves on
[2:54:01] <crossing_mao> History repeats itself....
[2:54:01] <+MrAtheGreat> I still think Woolie's greatest mistake is not hitting the weapon store when he had the money
[2:54:01] <privatesargent> its not paralysis traps, you get paralysis when you are on snow without warm gloves
[2:54:07] <%Th3SmartAlec> If Woolie manages to level up he can get Reggie
[2:54:08] <Gramcracker55> if you aren't going for magic you don't invest in magic.
[2:54:10] <+soFISHticated98> yeah
[2:54:14] <%kingkeldeo31> That's what the warm gloves prevent
[2:54:16] <+soFISHticated98> that was like 2 sessions ago though
[2:54:20] <+MrAtheGreat> @privatesargent WOOOOOW realy?!
[2:54:21] <Zalthia> I know it’s satisfying to see Reggie in first now- but jeeze Woolie really fell behind
[2:54:22] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @mrathegreat it was
[2:54:24] <TheHardM> I mean, all advice probably won't be reaching them, I'm assuming that they aren't reading chat.
[2:54:28] <C4m3r0n0409> remember when woolie was super rich and didn't buy a sword
[2:54:32] <%nintega010> minh could warp and kill reggie
[2:54:32] <BulletproofMoon> the latest manga chapter is out? sick.
[2:54:34] <%purplehermit12> @Gramcracker55 Spending money on a better defensive magic isnt bad. you're crazy.

[3:16:47] <spardanwarrior> Doesn't that make him Mr. Shakedown?
[3:16:50] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @razorgem this a wee channel so probably
[3:16:50] <%jiggy_snipe> so he keeps buiilding up gold, thats cool

[3:50:54] <%Superdandy96> Remember when Woolz and Reggie we’re having fun in Guilty gear?
[3:50:54] <%viewtifulr> Hate for our dense hero reggie
[3:50:54] <%Th3SmartAlec> Darkling = X Factor
[3:51:06] <Duke_of_HI> what a good manga volume
[3:51:07] <%Youknowwhyimhere008> wooliePOYO
[3:51:12] <+kyh9> Dokapon reveals people's nature
[3:51:15] <%jiggy_snipe> Darkling brought balance but Woolie messed up by letting Reggie get that exp
[3:51:18] <Tooniearcade> OWL2019Pharah
[3:51:27] <Nolat885> woolieCHAN
[3:51:47] <%neraren> reggie eould have got that xp either way
[3:51:52] <%neraren> That Fenrir was tough
[3:51:56] <jubejube56> Err idk if dark arts are dodgable
[3:52:03] <%neraren> He took advantage while woolie was weak
[3:52:04] <+kekkerscrew> COME HERE isn't Dodgable
[3:52:05] <%saltpiggu> Darkling just makes it work i think
[3:52:09] <%Livelinne> lomBurn lomBurn lomBurn
[3:52:11] <atema128> This manga arc really stepped it up with the plotting and twists, this volume is gonna sell gang busters.
[3:52:23] <%jiggy_snipe> but Woolie wouldn't have been weak if he cashed in his exp 1st maybe
[3:52:24] <+dmtjinni> Woolz
[3:52:36] <causewaybob> Are we wrapping up?
[3:52:38] <C4m3r0n0409> Woolie you made bad plays
[3:52:40] <%Th3SmartAlec> Power bottom
[3:52:42] <crimsonsaens> Woolie could've straight up hit 2nd or 1st if he took a second castle
[3:52:42] <%nintega010> It's just way closer
[3:52:47] <Paul_Cheenis_Big_Beenis> And you completely deserve it
[3:52:53] <C4m3r0n0409> You tried to fight the boss before getting xp
[3:52:54] <%Rhinoprotoss> I really hope Woolie never recovers
[3:52:55] <%neraren> That fenrir hit for 90% of his hp when he guessed right, it woulda hurt either way imo
[3:52:56] <%purplehermit12> its closer, it was your actions AFTER darkling that you messed up on woolie.
[3:53:03] <%ShadowpulseKDH1> Glad he didn’t. I want Reggie to win
[3:53:06] <%fuji_92> THE MORE THINGS CHANGE, the more they stay the same
[3:53:06] <%Th3SmartAlec> @crimsonsaens Didn't the Global takeover not actually take away all the towns?
[3:53:09] <coldfire0007> It made a big dent
[3:53:11] <%jiggy_snipe> Woolie should have bought weapons after getting all that gold before
[3:53:13] <+dmtjinni> I have so many Channel Points
[3:53:14] <%Superdandy96> It’s amazing the bumble lording from everyone. It’s only Reggie who got the best of it
[3:53:15] <%emperordread> Oh ho? You're walking towards me? woolieREGGIEFUL
[3:53:16] <%purplehermit12> @Th3SmartAlec it took away every town.,
[3:53:17] <C4m3r0n0409> He was level 30 when he fought that fenrir
[3:53:17] <%viewtifulr> I have money on reggie to win
