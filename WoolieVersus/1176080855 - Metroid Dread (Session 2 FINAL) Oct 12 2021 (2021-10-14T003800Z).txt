[0:00:18] <redwidow1358> Welcome back to Metroid Dread folks
[0:00:22] <bobdoletrasher> rare but precious
[0:00:23] <%MxZxMxN> @zanzibarian_hamster lol

[0:00:42] <+ClericOfSparda> Hey Oyabun!
[0:00:44] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> Shinespark stream let's go!
[0:00:45] <Shwepie> @zanzibarian_hamster Yes, it's where our trash lord lives.
[0:00:49] <zanzibarian_hamster> @MxZxMxN Like, I like tot hink that it's live, and not prerecorded
[0:00:54] <$NitronStreams> in before "Finale... part 3"
[0:01:10] <%rindy0> 0rond subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months, currently on a 13 month streak! i'm so happy this game is so good, like it's one thing to release a new game, and it's another to reinvigorate a franchise so thoroughly you wonder why it ever stopped in the first place

[0:03:18] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:03:33] <+vaderxyz1970> Session 4 Woolie and Min are no longer friends
[0:03:52] <+thelovingfool> blood pooool
[0:03:56] <+kewlmyc> Aqua is cool, probably the only cool protag in the franchise
[0:03:56] <@Menitta> I know Aqua from the prozd video
[0:04:00] <%GeneralSCPatton> Oh my god the main 3 of KH are just a Nart trio
[0:04:04] <+D00msDayDan> i can't wait to see what carries over from dread into the next smash
[0:04:05] <+kewlmyc> She's a dumbass though
[0:04:09] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> Metroid is BACK
[0:04:11] <Shad0wTag> @vaderxyz1970 Every Salt Party is getting closer
[0:04:22] <%LastHazzerd> Norted
[0:04:29] <Darren716> It did, Other M
[0:04:29] <%Irridium> Other M and Federation Force :)
[0:04:31] <%RealThiele> Other M nearly killed metroid
[0:04:35] <@Menitta> Oh no
[0:04:36] <%RealThiele> fed force was a joke
[0:04:36] <leith_aziz> We talking KH protags? Honestly, Sora's probably the best. He's a dumbass, but an endearing one
[0:04:41] <%Prevot> I mean it had gone out on Federation Force, that's a hell of a stinker
[0:04:45] <+Chopper3k> We don't talk about Other M
[0:04:45] <Shad0wTag> there is no federation force
[0:04:47] <krakendeals> Yo
[0:04:52] <leith_aziz> Federation Force was a strange decision
[0:04:53] <TheNorwinja> The Baby
[0:04:58] <Shad0wTag> federation force also helped
[0:04:59] <+VictorVonLouche> Is Other M the BIGGEST black mark against ANY game series?
[0:05:02] <%MxZxMxN> other m was tecmo?
[0:05:02] <%TubeMan642> The Baby
[0:05:03] <leith_aziz> Metroid never sold the best
[0:05:03] <@Menitta> The series never really got that high in sales. No game went beyond 3 million
[0:05:07] <Darren716> Other M is the DmC of video games
[0:05:24] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> 2002-2007 saw a ton of releases, but after that...
[0:05:24] <Shad0wTag> @victorvonlouche DMC Devil May Cry and DMC 2 also exist
[0:05:36] <DoctorMulholland> If Fed Force came out at a time when Metroid was getting regular releases it probably wouldn't have invoked so much ire. I mean no one got mad at Link's Crossbow Training.
[0:05:37] <%Vextalyst> @VictorVonLouche no that honor goes to third birthday
[0:05:37] <%Prevot> IMO other m was so bad it killed the series and then Federation Force was so much worse that they felt like they had to cleanse the palate
[0:05:39] <mothdude> The Super to Fusion wait seems cute now
[0:05:39] <Darren716> And Samus Returns is the DMC4 special edition
[0:05:39] <%ChoculaUltra> Metroid Prime Pinball tho
[0:05:46] <%GeneralSCPatton> Is Other M the DB Evolution of Metroid? Inspiring a quality comeback out of spite?
[0:05:55] <Shwepie> Super Metroid was mid-SNES, then it took until Gamecube to get Prime and Fusion on the GBA.
[0:05:57] <leith_aziz> @GeneralSCPatton Actually...yes
[0:06:02] <%RealThiele> Hunters and constant prime releases was a golden age
[0:06:04] <Shad0wTag> @darren716 thats a bit of a stretch
[0:06:08] <+VictorVonLouche> @Shad0wTag Didn't 100% ruin and break a character beyond recognition though.
[0:06:15] <@Menitta> No it's not 100% responsible
[0:06:27] <@Menitta> Other M did very well in Japan for Metroid
[0:06:28] <leith_aziz> DB Evolution is like the prime example of when you f*ck up so hard you make a good product to end on a better note
[0:06:33] <%Prevot> it can be dread
[0:06:40] <TheNorwinja> Do you think it will become a "New series" if it's successful?
[0:06:40] <Crunkle_Dunkle> gonna play back 4 blood bro?
[0:06:42] <Shad0wTag> @victorvonlouche Only because people knew how Dante should be
[0:06:59] <%ChoculaUltra> wait is that the discourse now - is DB Evolution "good" like the Star Wars prequels are "good" now?
[0:07:01] <mothdude> Dread getting canceled a second time was because of technology issues more than Other M
[0:07:17] <emMmDeeKay> They builds could Probably Run Metroid Dread xD
[0:07:29] <%RealThiele> yea WiiU dual control for a metroid game is not great
[0:07:37] <Shad0wTag> every day I get close to pulling the artesian builds website for when I move out and upgrade from laptop to.pc
[0:07:41] <leith_aziz> @Shad0wTag DMC sorta did that. DMC2 Dante is boring but with DMC3 context, it sorta works to make sense withing Dante's character. He's depressed after killing Vergil in DMC1. He also got a cool line
[0:07:45] <leith_aziz> *DmC
[0:07:56] <+MagiKestral> you stopped at a great point last time
[0:08:04] <@Menitta> Lmao
[0:08:14] <%RealThiele> last time of metroid: oh shit X everywhere shits fucked
[0:08:18] <Qsmash_> oh yeah, the Other M watchthrough
[0:08:20] <Shad0wTag> @leith_aziz I agree 100% but that's completely accidental
[0:08:23] <%Prevot> LUL
[0:08:25] <Qsmash_> on the before time
[0:08:26] <leith_aziz> Can you elaborate?
[0:08:28] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> It's OKAY
[0:08:37] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> gameplay wise
[0:08:37] <%Prevot> I agree with woolie
[0:08:39] <TheNorwinja> The baby
[0:08:39] <Wahrow> He LOVES it
[0:08:42] <redwidow1358> So where we left off yesterday was an incredibly sick boss fight, let's see if Woolie can get past this area in under five deaths.
[0:08:43] <%BananaSlammuh> Gameplay really clicks with some bosses in that one
[0:08:43] <@Menitta> ehhhh its serviceable
[0:08:48] <+vaderxyz1970> Samus, I am now authorizing you to take a bathroom break
[0:08:49] <+itslapdog> @thenorwinja The baby
[0:08:50] <emMmDeeKay> Imagine if Other M actually had good controls
[0:08:54] <+froduck42> the baby
[0:08:54] <+spawnzie> favorite metroid game got it
[0:08:57] <+MagiKestral> it's the most fair thing you can say about it
[0:08:59] <%Prevot> it wasn't better gameplay than 2D or Prime, but with was good enough
[0:08:59] <@Menitta> it was hampered by Wii
[0:08:59] <emMmDeeKay> like a DODGE button
[0:09:01] <Qsmash_> he defends it less
[0:09:02] <leith_aziz> Look Woolie, I won't nag on you for liking soemthing. I play RPG's and like Guilty Gear's plot. As a result, I cant be a hypocrite
[0:09:03] <mothdude> That Ridley theme was tight at least
[0:09:04] <Dova573> Idk man I feel the character assasination loke the third bday
[0:09:08] <+thelovingfool> I like the combat
[0:09:12] <Dova573> 'is like
[0:09:24] <+Neoepochx> Ayy
[0:09:25] <glass_marcus> Other M was the start of Samus getting into melee range
[0:09:27] <%BuraiBlaze> Can't blame Team Ninja for the the story though, that was Sakamoto
[0:09:29] <+MagiKestral> there's a way to make Other M great and most of that is story and timeline changes
[0:09:44] <%MegadBlitz> just like how people forget about the good parts of ME3 they only remember the ending and that's it
[0:09:48] <leith_aziz> @BuraiBlaze They legit saw no problem with the game. It was smooth development for once
[0:09:51] <%Prevot> a lot of the counters and boss killing animations in this are building on shit Other M did
[0:09:51] <Shwepie> Other M had a solid foundation for its gameplay but doesn't really build upon it to do something interesting. Being severely railroaded by the story is probably the reason for that.
[0:10:00] <%RealThiele> game goes up a full point if you can turn off VO LUL
[0:10:06] <TheNorwinja> What's the best Kirby game?
[0:10:08] <hollumdusk> look, other M is noticias Sonic 06 or DMC2 bad, Metroid fans Just expect better.
[0:10:09] <@Menitta> also the translation didnt help
[0:10:12] <+HollowMan190> I think a metroid 3rd person  game could still work
[0:10:16] <@Menitta> that script is just bad
[0:10:26] <leith_aziz> @thenorwinja Hard to say since when I see people talk Kirby, they're all great
[0:10:26] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:10:26] <DoctorMulholland> Still impressed you got that one missile expansion from the shinespark puzzle last time by doing it the fucked up crazy way last time, when the "real" solution is so much easier. SeemsGood
[0:10:27] <+HollowMan190> of done with a real controler
[0:10:27] <%MegadBlitz> Metroid May Cry?
[0:10:28] <%ChoculaUltra> always wanted like a Metroid OVA based on that manga that hasn't been republished in like 3 decades
[0:10:31] <@Menitta> I'd like to see another stab at 3rd person action metroid
[0:10:46] <+MagiKestral> @thenorwinja there's no bad ones but Super Star Ultra is my favorite
[0:10:55] <+VictorVonLouche> Rather just be 1st person and IN the suit ui than 3rd
[0:11:17] <Shad0wTag> A Metroid OVA would be okay by my book
[0:11:17] <3Xgilly> no sound
[0:11:19] <+ToadKing> can't hear the game
[0:11:21] <@Menitta> Well that's what Prime is for
[0:11:22] <+MagiKestral> can't hear it
[0:11:23] <+VictorVonLouche> MUTED
[0:11:26] <+spawnzie> Some cool shit
[0:11:27] <%RealThiele> game volume
[0:11:27] <mothdude> Kirby has been hitting it out of the park from Super Star Ultra onwards
[0:11:28] <Shad0wTag> sorta like the Kid Icarus anime shorts
[0:11:29] <+Neoepochx> literally just finished watching the VoD

[0:12:12] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> Stalling to check audio LUL
[0:12:17] <+spawnzie> we got that TRICKSTER
[0:12:19] <emMmDeeKay> >tfw no metroid tune :(
[0:12:21] <%HollowedIdjit> Oh we're at the START of this area okay
[0:12:25] <%Seancicle> üëÅüëàüèª
[0:12:30] <TheNorwinja> @MagiKestral Cool thx
[0:12:30] <+Fefe41> It was the Khezu theme that was playing there guys
[0:12:31] <redwidow1358> He got to the boss here, died, and went to bed
[0:12:37] <redwidow1358> It's a short area though
[0:12:38] <%HollowedIdjit> mmk
[0:12:43] <+Neoepochx> not too big
[0:12:50] <%MegadBlitz> oh shit we here now
[0:12:51] <+VictorVonLouche> This area's like 15 minutes long tbf once you know the lay out at this point.
[0:12:53] <Jnkolm> Progless Sadge
[0:12:55] <%RealThiele> many locks and sensors for the goo chamber
[0:12:57] <@Menitta> the checkpoints are incredibly generous but they are not saves
[0:13:04] <+Neoepochx> yeah checkpointing isn't hard saved
[0:13:14] <DoctorMulholland> You didn't lose a lot of progress, it's a short zone.
[0:13:17] <%fetrigon> üëÅÔ∏èüó®Ô∏è
[0:13:25] <+thelovingfool> mhm
[0:13:27] <%fetrigon> üëÅÔ∏èüó®Ô∏èüëÅÔ∏èüó®Ô∏èüëÅÔ∏èüó®Ô∏èüëÅÔ∏èüó®Ô∏èüëÅÔ∏èüó®Ô∏è
[0:13:28] <%LastHazzerd> cuz you haven't seen this yet in the save
[0:13:33] <redwidow1358> You'll be back to the fight in a couple minutes
[0:13:55] <%RealThiele> go grab dat plasma
[0:14:02] <+VictorVonLouche> ABSOLUTELY LOVE the background storytelling
[0:14:19] <%MegadBlitz> man I love this zone
[0:14:29] <bobdoletrasher> red is a big heal
[0:14:32] <+Neoepochx> 40 I think
[0:14:36] <+Neoepochx> for the yellow
[0:14:37] <+VictorVonLouche> Reds like a few tanks and missiles
[0:14:37] <%RealThiele> yellow is 40
[0:14:40] <fairore> like 20
[0:14:43] <%GeneralSCPatton> Red is the psaBig sip
[0:14:46] <%HollowedIdjit> 40 for Yellows, Greens for Resources, Reds for Full iirc
[0:14:47] <%RealThiele> red is 500 energy and like 50 missiles its big
[0:14:51] <%Prevot> honestly feel like the X heal way less than regular enemies do
[0:15:03] <TheNorwinja> Wow, haven't watched any of this game yet, but holy hell, it seems pretty fast compared to the other Metroids
[0:15:08] <redwidow1358> I always felt like the X healed more in this game
[0:15:16] <Jnkolm> Yea Samus got the Zoomies in this game
[0:15:19] <+Neoepochx> @prevot it is likely to encourage you to continue using the melee counter
[0:15:20] <$NitronStreams> SPLATTERED
[0:15:22] <Shad0wTag> He'll figure out guys
[0:15:24] <%fetrigon> SICK KomodoHype
[0:15:30] <Carlioo> I love the shinespark nonsense you can get up to in this game
[0:15:30] <mothdude> Shinesparking enemies to death is always satisfying
[0:15:37] <+Neoepochx> melee counter provides so much health in this game
[0:15:43] <TheNorwinja> Metroid by Sega
[0:15:48] <+Neoepochx> I wonder if it is more than Samus Returns?
[0:15:50] <%RealThiele> melee counter is THE way to play
[0:16:08] <Shad0wTag> I wonder what a Metroid done by Sega would be like
[0:16:09] <Jnkolm> They snuck a puzzle game into this Metroidvania after you get Shinespark
[0:16:10] <%MegadBlitz> the risk reward factor of melee counters is great design
[0:16:25] <greatspaceadventure> i suck so much at melee countering i'm amazed i still kept going at the bosses that gave me the hardest time without it
[0:16:38] <greatspaceadventure> i was probably just so happy to have a new Metroid game that i didn't care about dying over and over and over
[0:16:45] <+Neoepochx> I was talking with a friend about damage values. I always felt like Fusion had the hardest hitting damage. and also way more limited health returns.
[0:16:46] <+VictorVonLouche> melee counters are very binary though, 1 hit ko or take lots of damage. Could be improved.
[0:16:56] <%RealThiele> PURASUMA
[0:17:02] <greatspaceadventure> you're about to steal the Tesla coils from Elun's SpaceX factory
[0:17:04] <%MegadBlitz> yeeaahhh baby
[0:17:09] <+Neoepochx> Does this game have comparable damage and just more health drops?
[0:17:16] <$NitronStreams> Doctor Doom voice: PLASMA BEAM
[0:17:17] <keankong85> beam pierces enemies
[0:17:30] <redwidow1358> Just as an FYI the hidden parts of glowing areas can overlap with non-glowing areas. For example, the entrance to the hidden thing can be outside the flashing white zone. Usually this isn't the case but do look around.

[0:17:34] <%RealThiele> this game hits harder than fusion, but melee gives way more resources than fusion so its big feast or famine
[0:17:54] <Jnkolm> Some enemies and especially bosses do big chunks.

[0:18:00] <oneimportantthing> Finished this game earlier today, fantastic experience. GOTY so far.
[0:18:05] <+Neoepochx> @realthiele So the damage is bigger than fusion. got it. we were wondering about that.
[0:18:16] <Jnkolm> Yea if you don't parry the enemy that introduces the counter mechanic he can 2 shot you
[0:18:30] <%RealThiele> yea in fusion by the time you get gravity suit damage is back down to reasonable levels until you fight the SA-X
[0:18:31] <omnishadeee> red x is full resources replenish
[0:18:39] <+MagiKestral> I really hate how enemies who they want you to parry take so much damage otherwise
[0:18:53] <+Neoepochx> true. i guess I didn't have much trouble in the game at all until the first chozo guy encounter.
[0:19:00] <%RealThiele> @MagiKestral my biggest peeve about the game. 1 melee or like 20 missiles, woof
[0:19:12] <%SirGO0SE> Missile umph good
[0:19:38] <TheNorwinja> Broody cross
[0:19:39] <+Neoepochx> that was a bit tricky. but I think because of how generous health is in this game it isn't harder than fusion, it is hard to say being so far removed from it.
[0:19:51] <%fetrigon> YO
[0:20:01] <bippityjones> What's popping Actual Phyrexian
[0:20:01] <%RealThiele> Birdtorias
[0:20:02] <%LastHazzerd> Bionicle Rak'Shi lookin' ass
[0:20:04] <Carlioo> I've done a few "speedrun" attempts and I forgot that you can have this many missiles at this fight lol
[0:20:16] <+Neoepochx> Also, maybe Samus returns had harder bosses, or it took some more time to get used to the new mechanics. hard to say.
[0:20:19] <fairore> yeah i guess so
[0:20:22] <%fetrigon> bruuuuuuuhh THIS IS SO FUCKING SICK KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype
[0:20:25] <+D00msDayDan> we have now caught up with last time
[0:20:26] <%Sonicdy> Hello virgil
[0:20:30] <%BananaSlammuh> Seeing these Chozo warriors makes me want Samus to use a spear. I mean, arm cannon is cooler but a spear is cool too
[0:20:37] <$NitronStreams> Why they gotta make these Bird guys so bad ass
[0:20:38] <+Neoepochx> Woolie beat the sleepiness debuff
[0:20:41] <+MagiKestral> these aren't vergil, they're those angel knights from 4
[0:20:41] <TheNorwinja> It's got berserk armor
[0:20:41] <%MegadBlitz> where did woolz actually leave off last stream?
[0:20:48] <Ethel9727> @BananaSlammuh Fingers crossed for dual wielding
[0:20:51] <+D00msDayDan> @megadblitz right here
[0:20:52] <redwidow1358> He lost to this boss at the last stresm
[0:20:53] <DoctorMulholland> He left off right here
[0:20:54] <+Neoepochx> @megadblitz Right here
[0:20:57] <EaseTheSquirrel> holy shit this guy rules
[0:20:58] <bobdoletrasher> 1hp
[0:20:59] <%MegadBlitz> oh sick
[0:20:59] <%BananaSlammuh> @Ethel9727 Oh yes
[0:21:03] <%RealThiele> 1
[0:21:06] <redwidow1358> This guy doesn't fuck around
[0:21:08] <bobdoletrasher> na you cant
[0:21:09] <+thelovingfool> you cant
[0:21:14] <%Prevot> they went full symbiote with some of these X enemy designs
[0:21:15] <redwidow1358> You cannot parry that
[0:21:16] <bippityjones> VoteNay
[0:21:17] <%RealThiele> you cannot
[0:21:18] <+chiazam> No Flash
[0:21:20] <omnishadeee> no flash no parry
[0:21:21] <%SirGO0SE> No suit spear samus
[0:21:21] <oneimportantthing> The difficulty on this game is perfect
[0:21:23] <%LastHazzerd> Chat pls
[0:21:25] <Carlioo> you can only parry flash attacks
[0:21:30] <aliasz50> ur too good , most people forget the dash exist lol
[0:21:33] <%HollowedIdjit> Imagine if we get Chozo Enemies in Prime 4
[0:21:36] <oneimportantthing> "Git gud"-vania
[0:21:39] <%RealThiele> data gained
[0:21:41] <%SirGO0SE> atpGasm
[0:21:46] <TheNorwinja> Berserk mode
[0:21:48] <+Neoepochx> Dash is want makes the boss fights in this game so good
[0:21:49] <%MegadBlitz> downloaded
[0:22:07] <+Neoepochx> he sometimes tracks to you.
[0:22:14] <Carlioo> also is it just me that is reminded of the ing when looking at the transformed chozo?
[0:22:14] <%Prevot> didn't Prime 1 have you fight chozo ghosts
[0:22:14] <+MagiKestral> he only tracks when he's not slimy
[0:22:25] <%RealThiele> checkpointing in this game also makes deaths pretty fair
[0:22:26] <nothinbutnettle> second stage just jumps to the center
[0:22:28] <Ethel9727> @BananaSlammuh Heck maybe Samus picks up the spear for the finisher cutscene on this guy
[0:22:29] <+chiazam> @HollowedIdjit Imagine if we ever got a Prime 4
[0:22:29] <+Neoepochx> @prevot yeah on Talon 4
[0:22:48] <bippityjones> 2nd Phase Wall Yell is a scripted middle-room goop splash attack
[0:22:58] <Crimson_Aether> Samus fighting a Bionicle Rakshi
[0:23:08] <Ethel9727> Oh lord, it IS a rakshi
[0:23:12] <AllenDeadman> samus us so badass
[0:23:13] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> sick
[0:23:14] <TheNorwinja> sick
[0:23:14] <$NitronStreams> EAT IT
[0:23:14] <AllenDeadman> is*
[0:23:16] <+JustToWatch> SHE'S SO COOL
[0:23:16] <%LastHazzerd> Gotem
[0:23:17] <%fetrigon> KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype
[0:23:17] <GenmaKido> that is FIRE
[0:23:21] <Carlioo> get that shit outta here
[0:23:22] <%Deft_Thought> Damn she's good
[0:23:22] <%HollowedIdjit> STOMP ON DIS BITCH
[0:23:23] <EaseTheSquirrel> This is the best samus has ever been
[0:23:24] <emMmDeeKay> Samus Aran is the GOO SLAYER
[0:23:28] <redwidow1358> The double parry finisher
[0:23:31] <oneimportantthing> GET FUCKED
[0:23:34] <+chiazam> I wish we got Boss Titles
[0:23:35] <$NitronStreams> MOUTH VIOLENCE
[0:23:35] <%fetrigon> beat the devil out of em woolieSPICE woolieSPICE woolieSPICE
[0:23:37] <%Sonicdy> BE HUMBLE
[0:23:40] <Crimson_Aether> Samus is the best Bionicle
[0:23:40] <+D00msDayDan> get FUCKED
[0:23:41] <+MagiKestral> the E Tank that drove Max Dood mad
[0:23:48] <%MegadBlitz> shooting them in the mouth is super brutal but so good!
[0:23:49] <%RealThiele> walls are lies
[0:23:49] <+Neoepochx> I wonder if it was Mercury Steam that pushed for more shots of Samus being just absolutely cool and badass
[0:23:53] <+D00msDayDan> @chiazam if you look at the boss room on the map it'll tell you their name
[0:24:08] <Blank9> ez
[0:24:12] <%MegadBlitz> fuck I never figured this one out
[0:24:17] <%SirGO0SE> I wish that was me
[0:24:58] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1447814216103104512?t=FMN9Zf2S4JsthZvBIlfXDQ&s=19
[0:24:58] <TheNorwinja> Has anyone done the math on how big the morph ball would be?
[0:25:10] <+Tucker0603> how the hell did the morph ball even work?
[0:25:13] <bobdoletrasher> just items here @WoolieVersus
[0:25:23] <bippityjones> NotLikeThis WHOOPS
[0:25:24] <+D00msDayDan> i spent like half an hour last night trying to underwater bomb jump because i forgot you can just stand up and jump normally when you have the clearance
[0:25:25] <powerprotoman> you played yourself
[0:25:25] <+Tucker0603> does*
[0:25:27] <oneimportantthing> The chozo soldier fights are so memorable. The flash steps alone make them fantastic
[0:25:31] <%RealThiele> Well samus is around 7ft tall in suit, so id imagine morph ball is like 2' x2'
[0:25:32] <+NeonNobleKalzeria> whoops all X
[0:25:33] <+D00msDayDan> @Tucker0603 it's chozo tech i ain't gotta explain shit
[0:25:36] <+spawnzie> well RIP the planet
[0:25:38] <DoctorMulholland> That's a bad
[0:25:39] <mothdude> WHOOPS
[0:25:39] <dukenux> zoom on the visor
[0:25:40] <Shwepie> X are kind of adorable in this game. Can we keep them?
[0:25:41] <%fetrigon> oh no
[0:25:41] <redwidow1358> Oopsie doodle
[0:25:43] <Warbot40> Welp. Blow up the planet now.

[0:26:07] <+MagiKestral> I still blame Raven Beak
[0:26:12] <%Prevot> too bad, ZDR gotta go
[0:26:12] <redwidow1358> Planet's gotta go
[0:26:16] <Carlioo> "look I just wanted a sweet beam"
[0:26:18] <redwidow1358> Whole planet's gotta go
[0:26:20] <mothdude> Solve it the way Samus always does
[0:26:22] <Treasure_Vault> worth
[0:26:24] <TheNorwinja> @RealThiele Hmmm. Wouldn't it be bigger?
[0:26:26] <%Prevot> doomed and entire ecosystem
[0:26:27] <%HollowedIdjit> tbf the door locked behind her when she came in
[0:26:27] <Shad0wTag> And we had had to wipe put their only predator huh
[0:26:31] <zanzibarian_hamster> Whoopsy daisy, time for an exterminatus
[0:26:34] <dukenux> So anyway vargTrash
[0:26:38] <bobdoletrasher> x gon give it to ya
[0:26:40] <Dova573> We Fusion 2 bois
[0:26:45] <%GeneralSCPatton> FUCK^‚àû
[0:26:46] <+D00msDayDan> time to give it to the x
[0:26:47] <fairore> well the whole planet has to go now
[0:26:51] <Shad0wTag> We just had to kill ALL the Metroids huh
[0:26:59] <+JustToWatch> time for the problem solving powers of incredible violence
[0:27:01] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Welp, time to nuke the planet
[0:27:03] <StarMechV> without spoiling did woolz already got the birb talk?
[0:27:06] <+MagiKestral> y'all really thought we'd end this game without a planet exploding in the background
[0:27:14] <fairore> yes
[0:27:15] <%fetrigon> ZDR needs exterminatus immediately
[0:27:16] <TheAzureOracle> Oh we'll solve it alright
[0:27:16] <%HollowedIdjit> @starmechv yes
[0:27:22] <%fetrigon> LUL
[0:27:26] <omnishadeee> yellows heal, green are missiles and red are max everything
[0:27:28] <%RealThiele> @RealThiele i just did about 1/3 the height which comes out to 27 inches from 7 ft so 2 ft tall in ball
[0:27:33] <%GeneralSCPatton> TUTORIAL COMPLETED
[0:27:35] <+Neoepochx> You know what is great about this year? So many sequels to games that have been waiting for a decade or longer.
[0:27:41] <Shad0wTag> @magikestral but do we gotta save the animals now tho
[0:28:03] <+Tucker0603> is the goal to genocide the jello?
[0:28:15] <fairore> now it is
[0:28:17] <Shad0wTag> @tucker0603 always has been
[0:28:17] <redwidow1358> Jellocide
[0:28:24] <%HollowedIdjit> @shad0wtag Nothing left to save, we gotta kill em too.
[0:28:30] <%RealThiele> melee the jello or use 11 missiles
[0:28:31] <bobdoletrasher> the x are pretty resiliant
[0:28:44] <TheAzureOracle> Honestly missle upgrades really aren't necessary at a certain point
[0:28:46] <+NeonNobleKalzeria> I love how the X look like gummy candy
[0:28:47] <%RealThiele> LUL
[0:28:50] <bippityjones> LUL
[0:28:53] <%GeneralSCPatton> @tucker0603 Yeah... that jello is one of the most terrifying forms of universal apocalypse
[0:28:55] <TheAzureOracle> The game is extremely generous with them even during bosses
[0:28:55] <Shad0wTag> @hollowedidjit say no more -loads arm cannon with malicious intent-
[0:28:57] <bippityjones> PixelBob
[0:29:08] <%LastHazzerd> the shinespark puzzles in this game are nuts
[0:29:11] <Carlioo> good thing he already got practice
[0:29:29] <Shwepie> Missiles feel too weak in this game. So does Charge Beam. Melee is faster but beam spam feels like it takes second place.
[0:29:31] <bobdoletrasher> close
[0:29:33] <+D00msDayDan> X look delicious to me and i ain't even part metroid
[0:29:36] <$NitronStreams> ALMOST
[0:29:43] <%RealThiele> he had it
[0:29:53] <%LastHazzerd> noice
[0:29:54] <+MagiKestral> they really loved Fusion making this game, and that includes bullshit shinespark puzzles
[0:30:00] <Crimson_Aether> NOICE
[0:30:08] <bobdoletrasher> there's some REALLY fun shit later with the shinespark
[0:30:19] <+Neoepochx> the shinespark puzzles are not nearly as bad in this one by comparison, imo
[0:31:03] <bobdoletrasher> the shinespark feels the most powerful it's ever been in the series
[0:31:18] <%RealThiele> only thing i miss ia atuoshine when you run
[0:31:18] <redwidow1358> The shinespark puzzles in this game get fucking crazy, I almost hope Woolie goes out if his way to find them all
[0:31:23] <JacknZack27> I think shinesparking with the stick makes them easier for me to pull off then they were with a d pad.
[0:31:24] <Shwepie> Fusion may have had the hardest one for the easter egg, but Zero Mission's shinesparks can be brutal.
[0:31:26] <StarMechV> dang guess I'm gonna have to wait for the YouTube upload to see the birb talk
[0:31:36] <+Tucker0603> so her suit now is half organic half mechanical yeah?
[0:31:48] <+Neoepochx> maybe?
[0:31:57] <Shad0wTag> @tucker0603 has been since Fusion
[0:32:06] <Carlioo> everything. is. X!
[0:32:06] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:32:09] <%Prevot> I think it was always supposed to be half organic
[0:32:15] <jlow627> Why
[0:32:36] <mothdude> The organic parts of her suit is how the SA-X took control of it.
[0:32:41] <%HollowedIdjit> @shwepie what was the easter egg again? it's been a hot minute
[0:33:07] <bobdoletrasher> top right
[0:33:23] <bobdoletrasher> aha
[0:33:24] <Carlioo> tease
[0:33:38] <%RealThiele> shits locked
[0:33:52] <Shwepie> @HollowedIdjit Just Adam congratulating you on getting there and the shadowy federation figure wanting to tell you their plans. Adam says no and tells you to go back and get the upgrade you skipped.
[0:34:02] <%HollowedIdjit> Aha
[0:34:16] <bobdoletrasher> haha
[0:34:16] <Carlioo> man if only you knew what this was
[0:34:19] <Alzero83> ACCESS DENIED
[0:34:20] <GenmaKido> damn
[0:34:21] <%rindy0> gee I wonder what that is
[0:34:21] <%RealThiele> not cool enough to use this item
[0:34:24] <+VictorVonLouche> Yup that happens
[0:34:24] <redwidow1358> LOL
[0:34:26] <olaksi> You found... SOMETHING
[0:34:27] <DoctorMulholland> Very Zero Mission
[0:34:27] <%Prevot> LUL
[0:34:27] <%Deft_Thought> 1 ??? out of ???
[0:34:28] <OpenYourEels4TheNextFeels> Sequence Break!!!
[0:34:29] <%LastHazzerd> i didn't know you can do that!!!
[0:34:29] <redwidow1358> You are not allowed
[0:34:29] <%rindy0> zero mission had this
[0:34:31] <+NeonNobleKalzeria> just like in Zero Mission
[0:34:32] <Shwepie> ? 1/1
[0:34:33] <%MegadBlitz> at least you keep it
[0:34:34] <Jeemukun> haven't seen that since like, zero mission
[0:34:34] <Jnkolm> No cheating Cheats McCheaterson
[0:34:34] <+VictorVonLouche> I did  that at another location
[0:34:34] <@Menitta> Oh yeah those are cool
[0:34:36] <omnishadeee> its in samus returns too
[0:34:37] <FabulousReindeer> you got a mag but it doesn't fit in any of your guns :/
[0:34:41] <TenguGemini> It's a you won't sequence break that easily message
[0:34:41] <bobdoletrasher> i found a few before i got the upgrade
[0:34:44] <TheNorwinja> Illegal power
[0:34:44] <%Prevot> zero mission throwback
[0:34:45] <oneimportantthing> It's so good
[0:34:54] <keankong85> no worries, just keep going
[0:34:55] <Shad0wTag> wait did woolie sequence break??
[0:34:57] <+D00msDayDan> ? 1/1
[0:34:59] <%rindy0> nah you can easily get these without sequence brekaing
[0:34:59] <TheNorwinja> The forbidden potion
[0:35:04] <%rindy0> there are a few of these
[0:35:04] <+NeonNobleKalzeria> That's how it works in Super
[0:35:06] <Ethel9727> No throwing bullets
[0:35:13] <+VictorVonLouche> I think that happens in an earlier metroid game
[0:35:17] <bobdoletrasher> @WoolieVersus there are some special cutscenes for some sequence breaks
[0:35:19] <+MagiKestral> that's how you get Super Missiles early in ZM
[0:35:21] <+VictorVonLouche> With super missiles i think
[0:35:26] <%MegadBlitz> I don't think its sequence breaking they're sorta just there for you to collect
[0:35:40] <+NeonNobleKalzeria> Markers are unique per region iirc
[0:35:43] <powerprotoman> markers are per location
[0:35:46] <+Neoepochx> Each area has 6 markets
[0:35:50] <thackattack00> yeah you get 6 for each zone
[0:35:53] <+Neoepochx> markers*
[0:36:06] <%GeneralSCPatton> One thing that never made sense was how Samus gets new powers from thing's DNA, because Metroids don't do that. I think that receiving a gene splice and then immediately absorbing a bunch of her own X-ified DNA caused her to incorporate a bit of X gene-theft.
[0:36:12] <%HollowedIdjit> Oh its 6 per zone? i never used em so I didn't know
[0:36:12] <Carlioo> @Neoepochx damn, capitalism really got to the chozo
[0:36:35] <+Neoepochx> @carlioo the fall of the chozo was through economics
[0:36:43] <bobdoletrasher> @GeneralSCPatton her suit has some biological parts
[0:36:46] <+NeonNobleKalzeria> @GeneralSCPatton The baby Metroid literally steals Mother Brain's Hyper Beam
[0:37:00] <+sonofthedeepsouth> cmon completionist woolie
[0:37:02] <+VictorVonLouche> This is a story zone 1 route only for now lol
[0:37:03] <+MagiKestral> @generalscpatton I always thought the reason why Metroids on SR388 become so mutated is because of the species they regularly consumed there
[0:37:06] <%RealThiele> @GeneralSCPatton so my bad explaanation is that metroids succ to grow, evolve into their omega form eventually. Samus was growing slowly into her omega form (SA-X) by absorbing other X
[0:37:09] <omnishadeee> the x being in the game was accidentally leaked by a nintendo uk website for the game where a short video demo for beams showed an x
[0:37:10] <TenguGemini> I'm still in awe of the fact that they basically give you an air dash
[0:37:13] <%Prevot> pretty sure the powers she gets from the X in Fusion were hers to begin with
[0:37:14] <+sonofthedeepsouth> I believe in 100% woolie
[0:37:18] <+VictorVonLouche> X parasites are going to kick your ass if you are not careful
[0:37:19] <%tank7013> Yea those fire beam things are assholes
[0:37:21] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Tatakae woolie
[0:37:26] <lonosis47> Theres zero chance woolie is able to beat this game today
[0:37:32] <Carlioo> @Neoepochx in this 50-page essay I will explain how it wasn't the space pirates that killed the chozo, but the invisible hand of the free market
[0:37:41] <+Neoepochx> LUL
[0:38:06] <linSP> get that map%
[0:38:08] <%HollowedIdjit> Raven Beak is an Aggressive Capitalist
[0:38:10] <+Neoepochx> a good typo
[0:38:20] <%MrP33Ps> @lonosis47 ?? it's pretty short game all things considered. He can beat it today
[0:38:27] <+Tucker0603> the only Metroid game besides that vs one on the ds with the multiple different characters was one on the game boy advance so I feel very lost. that dash is rad though
[0:38:28] <%Prevot> Raven Beak is a Sigma Male chozo
[0:38:30] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Silksong next year. I must believe
[0:38:33] <lonosis47> If it takes him 5 months to finish 13 sentinel we gonna be on this for a minute
[0:38:35] <bobdoletrasher> haha
[0:38:36] <olaksi> write your name on the map
[0:38:39] <%Dr00_PhD> i did it
[0:38:41] <+Neoepochx> LOL
[0:38:41] <%GeneralSCPatton> @neonnoblekalzeria Hyper Beam always seemed like the generic "drink the unique energy and then shoot the unique energy" thing that her suit is always doing.
[0:38:43] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Do it 100
[0:38:43] <+thelovingfool> you dont
[0:38:47] <%Dr00_PhD> shits annoyinh
[0:38:50] <+Neoepochx> it don't matter, just items do
[0:38:52] <%MrP33Ps> 13 Sentinel is a horrible comparison lol
[0:38:59] <+MagiKestral> I don't think there's even a map completion marker
[0:39:01] <+thelovingfool> only items matter
[0:39:02] <%RealThiele> oh the map thing not just being uncovered when you go into a room drives my OCD wild
[0:39:04] <solracc25> you don't
[0:39:07] <$NitronStreams> need space jump to get all the high corners
[0:39:07] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:39:10] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Yes
[0:39:15] <+D00msDayDan> i feel called out
[0:39:17] <%Prevot> oh noooooo
[0:39:18] <%HollowedIdjit> ah shit
[0:39:20] <redwidow1358> Uh oh
[0:39:20] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Ghays how you do it woolie
[0:39:21] <Shwepie> @GeneralSCPatton I always assumed it was the suit taking the absorbed X and turning it into a useful power up. Chozo tech is basically magic.
[0:39:22] <%Dr00_PhD> flash shift did help out
[0:39:23] <redwidow1358> Oh dear
[0:39:25] <+sonofthedeepsouth> The baby?
[0:39:27] <%tank7013> The map should fill when you collect all items in the zone
[0:39:28] <Carlioo> quiet robe no!
[0:39:35] <%MrP33Ps> sad face
[0:39:39] <$NitronStreams> THATS FUCKED
[0:39:45] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @MagiKestral
[0:39:46] <solracc25> blubber
[0:39:49] <GenmaKido> aw fuck
[0:39:50] <%MrP33Ps> this game is so metal
[0:39:54] <%ChoculaUltra> FeelsBadMan Quiet Robe
[0:39:54] <+Atomic_ColliderSG> fuck this emmi
[0:39:55] <redwidow1358> Easy mode has been deactivated
[0:39:56] <+MagiKestral> the dark mirror of his last words is SO great
[0:39:57] <Carlioo> getting real chilly
[0:40:08] <%Deft_Thought> But that means you can get the rest of your stuff back
[0:40:11] <solracc25> frosty
[0:40:13] <%Deft_Thought> So it ain't all bad?
[0:40:15] <+OroOreo> Fuck that robot in particular
[0:40:15] <oneimportantthing> This EMMI is the WORST
[0:40:18] <%RealThiele> :)
[0:40:29] <+MagiKestral> @oneimportantthing the purple one is my least fave
[0:40:35] <+Neoepochx> The Blue and Purple one are terrible yea
[0:40:35] <yuggie_the_shark> But he‚Äôs not quiet robe, he‚Äôs an X
[0:40:39] <%Prevot> nah purple one is the worst
[0:40:44] <%MegadBlitz> I had little problem with those 2 emmi somehow
[0:41:00] <+thelovingfool> blue Emmi is a FUCK
[0:41:00] <%ChoculaUltra> the purple emmi can suck my dick from the back - fuck the purple emmi
[0:41:13] <%RealThiele> Stickbug X
[0:41:22] <+Demoli_PT> you cand efinitly shinespark here
[0:41:28] <%fetrigon> wtf
[0:41:29] <+Demoli_PT> theres heven a pick up at the end for it
[0:41:33] <omnishadeee> death by space wahel
[0:41:38] <%rindy0> purple emmi was so easy after dealing with yellow emmi
[0:41:49] <+Tucker0603> is everything on this planet the jello now?!?
[0:41:56] <+VictorVonLouche> yes
[0:41:58] <+D00msDayDan> pretty much
[0:41:59] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Just win LMAO
[0:42:00] <%MegadBlitz> everything is x
[0:42:02] <%RealThiele> jello everywhere system active
[0:42:03] <%GeneralSCPatton> Imagine having your energy filter-fed by a space whale
[0:42:06] <+OroOreo> Like 90%
[0:42:07] <%rindy0> @Tucker0603 the X do be like that
[0:42:10] <+Neoepochx> Blue emmi's area is the real killer
[0:42:11] <+D00msDayDan> the only thing that isn't x by this point are the robots
[0:42:15] <yuggie_the_shark> Planet ruined, time to blow it up
[0:42:16] <+Tucker0603> this planet is fucked then
[0:42:18] <%Prevot> X gon give it to ya
[0:42:30] <+VictorVonLouche> whale may drop a red
[0:42:35] <%rindy0> there's a reason the X are considered such a massive threat they genetically engineered metroids to get rid of them specifically
[0:42:45] <essence_of_lariatto> love the bugs becoming a bunch of tiny x
[0:43:03] <+spawnzie> "samus you fucked up"
[0:43:05] <Carlioo> "hey samus you fucked up fix it"
[0:43:07] <olaksi> "godammit woman"
[0:43:10] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Shit is fucked Samus
[0:43:10] <Shwepie> Dear Samus, someone else fucked up.
[0:43:18] <+ToadKing> yeah let's go with that adam
[0:43:18] <+spawnzie> uhhh yeah totally
[0:43:18] <%Deft_Thought> Yeah... Raven Beak.
[0:43:18] <CrazyMedicine> LUL
[0:43:18] <Treasure_Vault> that damn raven beak
[0:43:19] <+ALazo> sure, anyone but me
[0:43:20] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Yeah its his Failt
[0:43:20] <%tank7013> Hey someone had to open that door
[0:43:23] <omnishadeee> u closed the door behind u, raven opened it before u left. so it was him ya
[0:43:24] <Carlioo> damn those chozo
[0:43:27] <Alzero83> Adam: Im gonna take you for a ride
[0:43:27] <%rindy0> "samus, someone fucked up MASSIVELY, must have been that raven beak"
[0:43:28] <%RealThiele> definitely him
[0:43:30] <StarMechV> Um yeaaaah...
[0:43:33] <%HollowedIdjit> the door was locked behind you yeah
[0:43:33] <$NitronStreams> Samus opens the door "HOW COULD RAVEN BEAK DO THIS"
[0:43:35] <%MegadBlitz> ayo that hot bird man had parasite x aint that cuhraaazyyy
[0:43:36] <+D00msDayDan> reclaimer, the situation is dire! we must activate this installation's defenses if we are to contain this outbreak!
[0:43:37] <%Deft_Thought> DEF MYSTERY, HAHAH. Anyway, free X juice!
[0:43:41] <Shwepie> Technically it was locked behind you and you didn't do anything to open stuff.
[0:43:47] <StarMechV> WHO KILLED HANNIBAL
[0:43:47] <%rindy0> samus - "it's a good day to be a silent protagonist"
[0:43:48] <+sonofthedeepsouth> "Well well well look who it is but the consequences for my actions"
[0:43:53] <+MagiKestral> Adam saw the visual evidence of you opening the door, wasn't your fault what was behind it
[0:44:02] <+Neoepochx> Look like space jello
[0:44:08] <Qsmash_> I mean they were always blobs
[0:44:08] <+JustToWatch> oh no a zoner
[0:44:09] <bear_breaker20> theyre some mario star bits
[0:44:11] <thackattack00> I think the small ones from the little bug swarms look way better
[0:44:19] <%Deft_Thought> Deadly flubber
[0:44:21] <%Prevot> I dunno, replacing living creatures is pretty terrifying
[0:44:23] <%tank7013> The x are simultaneously way less and way more horrifying yea
[0:44:25] <+Neoepochx> Sometimes the least threatening looking things are the most dangerous
[0:44:26] <%RealThiele> baby flubber
[0:44:30] <yuggie_the_shark> The threatening part is that they can look like anything
[0:44:38] <Carlioo> time to get real cool
[0:44:41] <+Neoepochx> Like viruses and bacteria
[0:44:45] <+VictorVonLouche> GO
[0:44:50] <tompaste1> this emmi is a bitch
[0:45:00] <yuggie_the_shark> Dred
[0:45:04] <Shad0wTag> And to think we wiped out the Metroids just so the X could not be liked COOL OUR PREDATOR IS GONE NOW
[0:45:11] <+Tucker0603> so metroids were made to kill X but then we killed all the metroids......facking genius
[0:45:32] <StarMechV> the metroids tried to kill everyone soooo
[0:45:33] <buttlets1> @Tucker0603 not all of them
[0:45:34] <TenguGemini> I adore the dark room aesthetic whenever it pops up in this game
[0:45:35] <+Neoepochx> It isn't like Samus knew about the X
[0:45:55] <+blankwaffle> this game fucks
[0:45:57] <+OroOreo> In humanities defense, they thought the x was gone too
[0:46:01] <%GeneralSCPatton> Imagine pushing the ultimate threat so close to extinction that no one knows it exists or how you beat it.
[0:46:04] <%Deft_Thought> Hmm. How come Adam AI isn't calling Samus "Lady" anymore?
[0:46:10] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:46:10] <oneimportantthing> This EMMI is such a hassle
[0:46:10] <%Prevot> fucking chozo keeping their old mistakes secret
[0:46:12] <%Deft_Thought> Did they change that from Fusion?
[0:46:13] <Jnkolm> Space Pirates killed the last metroid, totally wasn't us no sir
[0:46:15] <+Neoepochx> She only knew about it during fusion after killing all the metroids
[0:46:16] <+thelovingfool> she only knew birgil put them SOMEWHERE
[0:46:16] <Carlioo> @Deft_Thought maybe he forgot
[0:46:18] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @Deft_Thought :) :) :)
[0:46:20] <Shad0wTag> @StarMechV and the X want to kill everyone also
[0:46:22] <+MagiKestral> dealing with emmis in water isn't as bad once I realized I could grapple blue walls
[0:46:24] <%Prevot> should've told samus about sr388
[0:46:35] <%Deft_Thought> @Deft_Thought woolieMIRIN
[0:46:38] <+VictorVonLouche> @Deft_Thought Cause the situation is pretty dire now, no more playing around
[0:46:44] <Jnkolm> He only said it once
[0:46:47] <+Neoepochx> @prevot the chozo should have told Samus a lot of things
[0:46:54] <Carlioo> nope
[0:46:56] <StarMechV> just keep watching
[0:46:59] <$NitronStreams> NOPE
[0:47:07] <buttlets1> @Deft_Thought he only calls her lady when he adds the "any objectons" part
[0:47:08] <%Deft_Thought> Oh shit, you're taking damage
[0:47:09] <%SirGO0SE> this game is very pretty.  should be timeless
[0:47:10] <Carlioo> LUL
[0:47:16] <%RealThiele> run awaaaay
[0:47:21] <fairore> to be fair the metriods were fucking a lot of shit up
[0:47:22] <yeildingthought> LUL
[0:47:23] <redwidow1358> RIP half your health
[0:47:30] <%Deft_Thought> @Deft_Thought Really?
[0:47:36] <Shwepie> @Neoepochx They really should have. I can't wait until Prime 4 when we find out the Chozo made Phazon.
[0:47:39] <Treasure_Vault> Is that a thing in the safe room, bottom right?
[0:47:46] <+Tucker0603> or EMMI that bad?
[0:47:47] <Potatoidea> Wow
[0:47:47] <%GeneralSCPatton> @starmechv Metroids just want to feed. X actively want to spread, multiply, and acquire powerful/intelligent hosts. X will commit mass suicide to eliminate things that threaten them with extinction.
[0:47:49] <CrazyMedicine> wow
[0:47:49] <$NitronStreams> FUUUUUCK
[0:47:51] <+Tucker0603> are*

[0:48:01] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Sneaky like
[0:48:11] <+Neoepochx> "Oh yeah that radiation comet, we did that. soz."
[0:48:16] <%rindy0> @Neoepochx can't wait to find out the chozo created the X to fight phazon (which they also created)
[0:48:17] <%Seancicle> üåêüîí

[0:48:57] <bobdoletrasher> naw
[0:49:01] <%SirGO0SE> Samus?! Samus?!!! SAMUUUSSS
[0:49:02] <essence_of_lariatto> no, they both use aeon
[0:49:02] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Hasn't beaten the game yet? Low-tier, un-following
[0:49:05] <StarMechV> Yum Yum delicious Metroid dna
[0:49:07] <+Tucker0603> wait they instant kill?!?
[0:49:11] <omnishadeee> flash shift needs full bar
[0:49:16] <%RealThiele> yea EMMIs kill you instantly
[0:49:28] <+Neoepochx> you have frame perfect counters to get away
[0:49:28] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> @Tucker0603 If you don't counter their move, yes
[0:49:29] <+MagiKestral> but the game checkpoints right outside where you last were
[0:49:32] <%Deft_Thought> Wow
[0:49:33] <Carlioo> oh wow never seen that happen before
[0:49:34] <essence_of_lariatto> get ice beamed

[0:49:37] <mothdude> Ice Beam baybeeeeee
[0:49:40] <%RealThiele> RIP
[0:49:41] <%Deft_Thought> Oh, the prompt is slower underwater
[0:49:42] <tompaste1> it freezes yoy
[0:49:42] <+Neoepochx> which change each time.
[0:49:43] <+VictorVonLouche> IT has ice beam
[0:49:45] <bobdoletrasher> it's eye freezes you
[0:49:48] <Carlioo> looks like woolie got... iced
[0:49:49] <%RealThiele> water timing
[0:49:49] <%Prevot> ice ice baby
[0:49:51] <%fetrigon> ice ice babyyyy
[0:49:51] <%LastHazzerd> Cold Lava
[0:49:55] <+Neoepochx> under water is a lot easier to counter blue emmi
[0:50:00] <redwidow1358> It freezes you and it moves a bit slower underwater, making the counter timing weird
[0:50:00] <%tank7013> Yea its vision cone touching you just freezes you it sucks
[0:50:12] <Carlioo> just hide in the corner
[0:50:30] <omnishadeee> if his cone of vision catches u u get frozen
[0:50:37] <+Neoepochx> big fall
[0:50:42] <+JonathLP> Are those X parasites?
[0:50:48] <+Neoepochx> yes
[0:50:52] <%RealThiele> everything is now X parasites
[0:51:07] <+Neoepochx> That dastardly Raven Beak unleashed the X
[0:51:21] <+JonathLP> Any more birdgil appearances?]
[0:51:22] <%SirGO0SE> Arctic blast!
[0:51:26] <redwidow1358> I can't believe Raven Beak would do this
[0:51:33] <%MegadBlitz> did berdgil kill those people?
[0:51:40] <+Neoepochx> Raven Beak must be stopped!

[0:52:29] <+Neoepochx> even the most innocuous creature.
[0:52:30] <%RealThiele> X did deliver it to everywhere
[0:52:34] <olaksi> how to entire planet
[0:52:39] <bobdoletrasher> pitfall block
[0:52:43] <+VictorVonLouche> Looks like a drop block
[0:52:51] <%Deft_Thought> @Neoepochx That's why the whole planet's gotta go wooliePOYO
[0:52:57] <emMmDeeKay> The DMX Parasite
[0:53:05] <essence_of_lariatto> this game has such good backgrounds
[0:53:15] <bippityjones> [*don't worry about it* block]
[0:53:16] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1447814216103104512?t=FMN9Zf2S4JsthZvBIlfXDQ&s=19
[0:53:19] <%RealThiele> dick block
[0:53:24] <yeildingthought> Oh wow, that‚Äôs a really tight bomb jump
[0:53:31] <EaseTheSquirrel> really wheres kirby when we need him, he'd deal with the problem
[0:53:37] <essence_of_lariatto> you'd also kill yourself it that landed on you
[0:53:40] <%Prevot> this fucking grapple block
[0:53:46] <%MegadBlitz> could kirby kill the x parasite?
[0:53:51] <%Prevot> so anything how it blocks the way later
[0:54:00] <essence_of_lariatto> kirby is basically an x parasite
[0:54:03] <Kaji04> *whispers* Screwattack
[0:54:04] <+OroOreo> Ye
[0:54:07] <+VictorVonLouche> Havent even got the space jump yet though lol
[0:54:09] <%RealThiele> BIG dmaage
[0:54:10] <Carlioo> hey bet you'd like the screw attack right now
[0:54:24] <+Neoepochx> Screw attack is so busted
[0:54:35] <%rindy0> screw attack deals so much damage in this one
[0:54:37] <bippityjones> Is Screwattack still around? I miss their retrospective videos
[0:54:40] <%GeneralSCPatton> @megadblitz I don't think that Kirby's kind have DNA or are even composed of cells, so he's probably immune.
[0:54:48] <%Deft_Thought> DAS AIGHT
[0:54:51] <yuggie_the_shark> dubbl jump
[0:54:51] <%RealThiele> its ok

[0:55:19] <bobdoletrasher> haha
[0:55:19] <%SirGO0SE> they really like the jebait in this one LUL
[0:55:20] <Shwepie> Double jump? In my 2D Metroid?!
[0:55:20] <+MagiKestral> finally, the double jump in Prime is canon
[0:55:22] <Jnkolm> We have Screw Attack at home
[0:55:23] <essence_of_lariatto> it's like teaching newbies how to space jump
[0:55:24] <GarbageNirvana> They tease the Gravity Suit so much in this one
[0:55:27] <%LastHazzerd> close enough
[0:55:27] <%Deft_Thought> A "HoodScrew" if you will
[0:55:27] <emMmDeeKay> Screwattack at Home
[0:55:28] <+Tucker0603> that's rad
[0:55:30] <SoulKingCrazzmatazz> whatsup chat? hey @WoolieVersus
[0:55:39] <%LastHazzerd> the morph ball and the grav suit, they tease so much
[0:55:39] <emMmDeeKay> with Tourette Carl
[0:55:39] <SoulKingCrazzmatazz> new metroid looking good so far?
[0:55:48] <bobdoletrasher> its just a double jump LUL
[0:55:53] <+thelovingfool> this gap is deceitful
[0:56:09] <+Neoepochx> @soulkingcrazzmatazz it is very good
[0:56:09] <emMmDeeKay> Screwattack at home with Tourette Carl
[0:56:18] <bobdoletrasher> @WoolieVersus read the ability again
[0:56:18] <%Prevot> woolie...
[0:56:19] <+thelovingfool> you can make it
[0:56:20] <%tank7013> @SoulKingCrazzmatazz I beat it the other day, it's great
[0:56:23] <yuggie_the_shark> you can jump long underwatder
[0:56:23] <%rindy0> remember, it said under water you can't gain height, but you can gain distance
[0:56:29] <+thelovingfool> ^
[0:56:30] <thackattack00> spin boost and super missiles feel so weird and under-utilized in this game. weird half-steps that are almost immediately replaced/outclassed
[0:56:35] <mothdude> Yeah this tripped me up for a while
[0:56:39] <oneimportantthing> You can get further, just not higher
[0:56:46] <SoulKingCrazzmatazz> very cool :)
[0:56:54] <SoulKingCrazzmatazz> love to see the series back in the spotlight again
[0:57:06] <%Deft_Thought> It sold really well too
[0:57:13] <%Deft_Thought> Or is selling really well
[0:57:20] <%RealThiele> yea its selling quite well
[0:57:25] <%Deft_Thought> You got a gravity door, chief
[0:57:26] <%Prevot> super missiles are necessary cause missiles start to fall behind your beam attacks in damage
[0:57:32] <GarbageNirvana> folks been hungry for troid
[0:57:34] <essence_of_lariatto> it sold extremely well for a metroid game
[0:57:39] <%rindy0> I mean being "the best selling metrokd" doesn't mean much, the market is way, way, larger than it was when the last metroid released
[0:57:39] <bobdoletrasher> they do
[0:57:46] <+Neoepochx> I think it could easily be the best selling game in the series
[0:57:48] <omnishadeee> its per zone
[0:57:48] <bobdoletrasher> i mean the zone remember
[0:57:49] <bobdoletrasher> s
[0:57:49] <+thelovingfool> they do
[0:57:50] <Shwepie> 6 per
[0:57:50] <thackattack00> 6 per, yep
[0:57:50] <+Neoepochx> they do
[0:57:52] <churropoppa> it is 6 per zone
[0:57:52] <+JonathLP> 6 per
[0:57:56] <+Neoepochx> 6 per zone yes
[0:57:56] <%RealThiele> each zone has it own markers
[0:58:00] <redwidow1358> 6 per zone
[0:58:00] <%MegadBlitz> 6 per zone
[0:58:06] <essence_of_lariatto> I think it already is the best selling, aside maybe from prime 1
[0:58:07] <+ShinobiPhoenix> it's a different 6 per zone
[0:58:14] <mornil314> Yeah, it‚Äôs per zone
[0:58:16] <+ShinobiPhoenix> I am at Endgame.
[0:58:19] <oneimportantthing> Adam Smith wrote a paper on the free Marker once
[0:58:29] <linSP> sussy markers
[0:58:35] <+ShinobiPhoenix> I am just not beating the game until I 100% the items
[0:58:43] <%Deft_Thought> Awwwww shit
[0:58:52] <NotHereToStream> regular mob oh shit
[0:58:58] <redwidow1358> They do in fact show up a few times from now on
[0:59:08] <+ShinobiPhoenix> I LOVE these guys, I am a big fan of double lances
[0:59:14] <redwidow1358> The X just keep crawling into new bodies
[0:59:14] <yuggie_the_shark> check out those shoulder pads
[0:59:30] <MayShip> that air dash is so sick
[0:59:45] <%RealThiele> sleepin
[0:59:51] <Shad0wTag> chat what if we were the x the entire time
[0:59:53] <+thelovingfool> it's later than you think
[0:59:53] <Alzero83> Shame on you
[0:59:55] <+VictorVonLouche> the windows large just wait for the blink
[0:59:58] <Alzero83> being fooled twice
[1:00:01] <%tank7013> I wonder if you can even kill them normally or if the counter is required
[1:00:06] <oneimportantthing> Don't get greedy Woolsworth
[1:00:06] <+ShinobiPhoenix> the fighting game parry man is sleeping on the job
[1:00:09] <Jnkolm> Good thing he doesn't have a spike in his face or he woulda got ya
[1:00:09] <NotHereToStream> sick execution
[1:00:10] <bippityjones> I was hoping they'd toss two at me or something when I got to that room. I think he's there just to make you feel like you're making skill progression.
[1:00:14] <%Deft_Thought> Right in the mouf
[1:00:16] <+VictorVonLouche> Don't treat everyone like an EMMI
[1:00:17] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:00:23] <gaminglink25> are you rushing or are you dragging
[1:00:24] <+JonathLP> Is the air dash sound effect the same as the menu select sound from super metroid?
[1:00:35] <%RealThiele> no
[1:00:43] <Fluffy_Tamamo> Knowing Woolie's speed has he parried any EMMIs?
[1:00:43] <linSP> did someone X the chorizo
[1:00:51] <+Neoepochx> he has
[1:01:24] <+VictorVonLouche> That grapple CAN be done
[1:01:25] <thackattack00> there's enough time it's just tight
[1:01:29] <%RealThiele> its doable just gotta be quickwoolie parried
[1:01:31] <Carlioo> double jump you fool
[1:01:33] <%Prevot> I wonder what kind of ability would let you stand on that... hmmm
[1:01:36] <+VictorVonLouche> Just work out how to land
[1:01:37] <yuggie_the_shark> you arent ready for it yet
[1:01:38] <Jnkolm> he parried the first Emmi after the tutorial
[1:01:49] <thackattack00> can't ledge grab it
[1:01:50] <yeildingthought> LUL that‚Äôd be wild if it could reach that far
[1:01:51] <+ShinobiPhoenix> the solution to this puzzle should be obvious
[1:01:53] <thackattack00> gotta land clean
[1:01:57] <olaksi> looks like you can waste time grabbing to the ledge
[1:01:57] <+thelovingfool> you can't get it right now
[1:01:58] <+ShinobiPhoenix> so don't worry about it
[1:01:58] <bobdoletrasher> nah not yet
[1:01:59] <+VictorVonLouche> Land on the platform properly
[1:02:02] <omnishadeee> gotta land on it not climb up
[1:02:04] <CaptainBright> double jump, no clinging
[1:02:09] <thackattack00> you can absolutely get it right now
[1:02:20] <oneimportantthing> Woolie, what does your missile do?
[1:02:20] <yuggie_the_shark> these people are wrong, you dont have the thing for it yet
[1:02:31] <thackattack00> bruh i literally did it
[1:02:32] <mothdude> it's not worth the effort right now.
[1:02:34] <oneimportantthing> Or what does it not do?
[1:02:35] <thackattack00> twice
[1:02:40] <fairore> he has the grabble
[1:02:43] <GarbageNirvana> lotta stuff here seems to be intentionally hard enough that you could do it for a speedrun without getting the item you need if you're good enough
[1:02:48] <%RealThiele> @yuggie_the_shark bruh you can get that grapple right now
[1:02:55] <powerprotoman> its literally just land on the platform, theirs no trick to it
[1:03:03] <%fetrigon> woolieONEGUY
[1:03:06] <bobdoletrasher> you can put multiple of the same color
[1:03:10] <+ShinobiPhoenix> it's not about doing something while frustrated. the solution to it is obvious and by intended design. we have literally already seen the puzzle's solution
[1:03:28] <%RealThiele> the best LUL
[1:03:29] <+ShinobiPhoenix> so just wait for the solution
[1:03:34] <Alzero83> Get Poked
[1:03:36] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> This one's an ass
[1:03:45] <oneimportantthing> The DREAD, lol
[1:03:53] <+thelovingfool> it's literally not worth doing when a easier solution is available later
[1:03:53] <essence_of_lariatto> all emmi's after green are a bit of a pain
[1:03:58] <+ShinobiPhoenix> I will be that guy who doesn't think the EMMI parts are hard
[1:04:05] <Jnkolm> Accept your helplessness
[1:04:14] <oneimportantthing> Nooo stay there
[1:04:15] <GarbageNirvana> how much lore have we seen btw
[1:04:23] <%RealThiele> EMMI isnt super hard but its fun and adds a bit on tension
[1:04:28] <oneimportantthing> Yaaay
[1:04:37] <+ShinobiPhoenix> it's just a lot of planning, executing and having your contingencies and tactics
[1:04:42] <SunsetJack> Never realized those where jump markers.
[1:04:45] <+Atomic_ColliderSG> the emmi parts aren't hard they are just really trial and error
[1:05:07] <%MegadBlitz> EMMI zones aren't super hard but definitely test your ability to do that shit under pressure
[1:05:16] <+ShinobiPhoenix> a lot of people don't get how much you're supposed to look for your "loops" to get around EMMI and USE YOUR OWN NOISE TO MANIPULATE THEIR POSITIONS
[1:05:31] <GenmaKido> WOW
[1:05:33] <+thelovingfool> I don't think I can play this game on my switch anymore cause my drift is getting so bad
[1:05:38] <oneimportantthing> Killing this EMMI is a massive fuck
[1:05:47] <+ShinobiPhoenix> it's like Metal Gear Solid in 2D
[1:05:54] <%MegadBlitz> killing this EMMI is a puzzle
[1:05:59] <%RealThiele> these are the worst sections of the game imo. cores are punching bags
[1:06:08] <bazz_tv> lol they brought back the  cheerios
[1:06:09] <+JonathLP> beam
[1:06:10] <+Atomic_ColliderSG> I think killing this emmi is the worst part of this game
[1:06:12] <+D00msDayDan> it was really satisfying when i worked out how to kill this one
[1:06:24] <thackattack00> fun fact: you can speed boost into this central unit room and shinespark it, immediately skipping to its second phase
[1:06:25] <+ShinobiPhoenix> @bazz_tv of course, it's a BRAIN
[1:06:31] <Blank9> I don't remember having any trouble with this emmi
[1:06:36] <+thelovingfool> I just Anand in the middle and tap jump
[1:06:38] <yuggie_the_shark> this is my favorite emmi to kill
[1:06:38] <GenmaKido> yo?
[1:06:43] <GarbageNirvana> The chozo were ultimately responsible for mother brain weren't they
[1:06:48] <+Tucker0603> FUCKING RAD
[1:06:48] <+MagiKestral> if it's the one I'm thinking of, this one took me a bit
[1:06:51] <+VictorVonLouche> theres a spot to easily kill the emmi this time yeah
[1:06:56] <Shwepie> Time for the reminder of how to use this weapon.
[1:06:58] <mothdude> Yeah Chozo were all about those brain computers
[1:07:02] <%haitakaa> the chozo built mother brain I believe
[1:07:03] <buttlets1> @thackattack00 you can do the same to another boss later in the game, and it one-shots it
[1:07:05] <oneimportantthing> @yuggie_the_shark are you a masochist lmao
[1:07:06] <%BananaSlammuh> @thackattack00 OH? Is there a unique cutscene or does its armor just break?
[1:07:07] <+MagiKestral> @garbagenirvana you're telling me the giant brain plugged into a massive facility wasn't natural?
[1:07:13] <%Prevot> I like having these Mother brain throwbacks without it being as bullshit as MB boss fights were
[1:07:17] <+blankwaffle> the top of that room though
[1:07:17] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:07:17] <essence_of_lariatto> They created mother brain to control the metroids, then she went awol'
[1:07:18] <GarbageNirvana> wild, I know
[1:07:20] <+thelovingfool> the upper part if the rooms a good spot
[1:07:21] <thackattack00> @BananaSlammuh just breaks the armor
[1:07:24] <GenmaKido> majinoHorror
[1:07:26] <bazz_tv> @shinobiphoenix what's with brains and cheerios in this series?
[1:07:36] <%BananaSlammuh> @thackattack00 cool af
[1:07:37] <+Tucker0603> HOLY SHIT THAT'S RAD
[1:07:39] <+ShinobiPhoenix> I won't tell you what I did, but I can say it should have been more obvious to me what the best position was
[1:07:39] <+Thebigmeech92> Thebigmeech92 subscribed with Prime. 
[1:07:40] <+VictorVonLouche> I like that it reminds you of its mechanics
[1:07:43] <bobdoletrasher> the ceiling @WoolieVersus
[1:07:53] <the_hidden_yeti> yeah this one took me a while to figure out
[1:07:54] <+thelovingfool> the ceiling
[1:07:56] <+VictorVonLouche> woolie the spider grab
[1:07:58] <+Ropcord> DO IT
[1:08:00] <mothdude> shhh
[1:08:02] <+ShinobiPhoenix> I found the best position only after a lot of running around
[1:08:03] <oneimportantthing> Have fun üòÇüòÇ
[1:08:03] <%RealThiele> yea i killed it by the ceiling zipline
[1:08:06] <the_hidden_yeti> dont tell him chat
[1:08:14] <+Ropcord> woolie will figure it out
[1:08:21] <%tank7013> Don't just tell him the solution caht shit
[1:08:22] <irisluv333> this one definitely took awhile to figure out
[1:08:24] <%RealThiele> theres a few places you can kill them each zone
[1:08:29] <+TheyCallMeVawn> Aiming hard
[1:08:35] <+ShinobiPhoenix> good Woolie got it
[1:08:39] <bobdoletrasher> YEA

[1:08:55] <Tnecniv_DG> Yooo let's go
[1:08:56] <+crewmate> oakydeRIP
[1:08:56] <Shwepie> @GarbageNirvana Yeah, it's canon that they made Mother Brain. They also gave similar brain computer tech to the federation.
[1:08:57] <Gelphaze> Cluch!
[1:08:57] <%fetrigon> wooo
[1:08:58] <oneimportantthing> Uuuhhhh
[1:08:59] <%LastHazzerd> DAMN
[1:08:59] <Shad0wTag> CLIP IT
[1:09:00] <oneimportantthing> WOW
[1:09:01] <GenmaKido> ice ice baby
[1:09:05] <oneimportantthing> HOLY FUCK
[1:09:08] <bippityjones> VoteYea Silverhand
[1:09:08] <bazz_tv> DMC reflexes
[1:09:10] <DudeDern> In the FACE
[1:09:11] <+LazyAss24Seven> cool as ice
[1:09:14] <+Slattsquatch> ICE to meet you
[1:09:15] <%MrP33Ps> Woolie loving the room every bad player hates lol
[1:09:17] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> It got me too lol
[1:09:24] <faeron93> oh it's a missle
[1:09:25] <redwidow1358> I didn't have that setup in mine lmfao
[1:09:29] <LVL1_Scumbag> What killed the dinosaurs?
[1:09:37] <essence_of_lariatto> do ice missiles do more damage, I couldn't tell
[1:09:48] <faeron93> no ice beam this time around?
[1:09:51] <+ShinobiPhoenix> I LOVED that room and killed her at the position Woolie was standing at when he melted her face
[1:09:52] <%RealThiele> ice missiles seem to do base missile damage super orr regualr
[1:09:59] <TenguGemini> ice beams are incompatible with Metroid DNA
[1:10:05] <thackattack00> samus is no longer compatible with ice beam due to metroid DNA, according to Fusion
[1:10:13] <GenmaKido> https://clips.twitch.tv/EmpathicSleepyPotatoBrokeBack-8UwizO04RusUiun_
[1:10:17] <+Tucker0603> oh is the omega cannon just to kill Emmis?
[1:10:23] <Shad0wTag> https://clips.twitch.tv/ScaryHyperSageHotPokket-rIZb2U-X1E_3jYzw
[1:10:23] <thackattack00> yeah
[1:10:23] <+SoftBoiledBrains> softbo8ICON  whats up woolie, hows the game
[1:10:25] <%fetrigon> @tucker0603 ye
[1:10:27] <%RealThiele> yea Omega cannon is the EMMI buster
[1:10:31] <+ShinobiPhoenix> I saw the rails and I was like "OOOOHHH, THEY WANT YOU TO LEAD EMMI ACROSS THE TOP!"
[1:10:33] <tanarath> How ate you liking Dread?
[1:10:41] <bazz_tv> is fine ice beam becomes a hassle for enemy clearing later
[1:10:54] <%RealThiele> E
[1:10:56] <bazz_tv> ice missiles are more precise
[1:11:05] <+thelovingfool> also meleeing frozen enemies kills them instantly
[1:11:28] <Shwepie> @thackattack00 But Samus got the ice beam at the end of Fusion!
[1:11:30] <+Ropcord> the omega cannon is also the last weapon you get in the good ending of hunters and i haven't seen anyone mention that
[1:11:33] <+Traffun> ice missiles + melee is really clean
[1:11:34] <+SoftBoiledBrains> I actually was going over some MVA clips from their twitch account, and caught you on there
[1:11:37] <+SoftBoiledBrains> that was a magical place
[1:11:44] <+VictorVonLouche> BEST ABILITY
[1:11:50] <essence_of_lariatto> behold, one of the most useful abilties
[1:11:52] <+thelovingfool> yeyeye
[1:11:52] <+Tucker0603> YOOOOO
[1:11:53] <%HollowedIdjit> oh is it time
[1:11:54] <the_hidden_yeti> the statues are SO COOL
[1:11:56] <%Prevot> good ass ability
[1:12:00] <bippityjones> COMPLETE GOBLIN ELIMINATION
[1:12:00] <%MegadBlitz> aw shit time to slay
[1:12:04] <%RealThiele> yea at the end of fusion she absorbs SA-X, a copy of her in her peak physical and genetic form. she loses most of her Metroid-ness
[1:12:04] <%Deft_Thought> When does Samus get a cool ass sash or somethin
[1:12:05] <%Prevot> SUPERIOR XRAY SCAN
[1:12:06] <redwidow1358> Lie detector
[1:12:08] <+D00msDayDan> easy mode unlocked
[1:12:08] <bobdoletrasher> o yea thats a good one
[1:12:12] <$BallerSwagBro9k> GOBLINS SLAYED
[1:12:15] <%RealThiele> GOBLIN SLAYER
[1:12:17] <oneimportantthing> I got this one super early
[1:12:19] <+ShinobiPhoenix> so funny thing, you can get this WAY earlier if you find the TELEPORTER into this room from another zone
[1:12:24] <Frazbeee> did that solar flare hit yet?
[1:12:26] <yuggie_the_shark> not start ->
[1:12:32] <bippityjones> Not so little
[1:12:35] <Darren716> Legit you can spam this so much
[1:12:39] <bazz_tv> did Wools meth QR yet?
[1:12:42] <%GeneralSCPatton> Yeah, I did that big bomb jump to get that one way early
[1:12:44] <Darren716> And it lasts a while
[1:12:48] <Kaji04> didn't Super and fusion have the xray too?
[1:12:48] <bobdoletrasher> D pad @WoolieVersus
[1:12:48] <linSP> goblin slayer fr
[1:12:58] <%LastHazzerd> oh yeah, the older start button had an arrow, yeah?
[1:13:00] <bippityjones> Whole screen
[1:13:02] <+Jonesman64> right d-pad
[1:13:02] <DoctorMulholland> Yeah QR was in the last stream
[1:13:03] <IntenseNerdRage> @bazz_tv yes last stream around the 6 hour mark
[1:13:12] <+thelovingfool> you got, your ADHD solver
[1:13:14] <bazz_tv> nicr
[1:13:20] <bazz_tv> nice*
[1:13:21] <bobdoletrasher> use it again
[1:13:23] <%RealThiele> can use it in ball form too
[1:13:31] <bippityjones> The years of having to bomb every part of the screen arr OVER
[1:13:40] <+ShinobiPhoenix> if there's ANYTHING about the game I don't like it's that Flash and Radar recharge instantly and Stealth takes forever or not at all if you're not moving
[1:14:03] <%RealThiele> stealth is rather stingy on its use
[1:14:04] <CaptainBright> You can pulse in the ball as well, Woolie
[1:14:06] <SunsetJack> @shinobiphoenix That would be broken my dood.
[1:14:11] <+thelovingfool> that's kinda the point shinobi
[1:14:12] <thackattack00> stealth recharging super fast would break the EMMI sections
[1:14:12] <+SoftBoiledBrains> Now Woolie VS the Reboot PS1 game, now that's lit
[1:14:12] <kikoeru_san> looks like the x parasite is super duper a thing still
[1:14:24] <kikoeru_san> gotta love being late lol
[1:14:24] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:14:30] <+ShinobiPhoenix> the EMMI sections are already easy
[1:14:33] <IntenseNerdRage> There are many things I liked about old Metroid games, but boy, am I fucking glad this new team has set their foot down on a hidden block finder, cause fuck
[1:14:36] <Jnkolm> Can't you basically walk through most of the Emmi zone with one stealth use already?
[1:14:42] <+Tucker0603> these birbs be swole
[1:14:46] <+ShinobiPhoenix> and you can use Stealth for more than EMMI
[1:14:49] <%RealThiele> @kikoeru_san certain unnamed bounty hunter may have accidentally released all the X
[1:14:55] <thackattack00> yeah they're already easy but better stealth would straight up null them
[1:15:06] <bobdoletrasher> or the outside area
[1:15:10] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> Could do it now
[1:15:14] <+Traffun> speedbooster?
[1:15:19] <Carlioo> oh man, is he gonna do it
[1:15:31] <+ShinobiPhoenix> to be honest, Flash Shift already nulls EMMI
[1:15:32] <oneimportantthing> Uh good luck
[1:15:38] <Carlioo> aw. was hoping he'd accidentally sequence break
[1:15:44] <+Ropcord> i'm used to old metroid maps so this map makes every room look massive LUL
[1:15:52] <+Traffun> try it here?
[1:15:54] <kikoeru_san> its good to see that someone finally brought back the old Super Metroid scan visor tech
[1:15:57] <+thelovingfool> you probably need some form of... attack if screws
[1:16:18] <+ShinobiPhoenix> @kikoeru_san did you not play Samus Returns?
[1:16:21] <bazz_tv> @ropcord the map size wise reminds me a lot to the Strider reboot
[1:16:23] <+SoftBoiledBrains> It looks really cool
[1:16:37] <Reilata> Man I'm late, did I miss any bosses?
[1:16:39] <kikoeru_san> I did
[1:16:43] <+SoftBoiledBrains> I was on the fence on buying it since I have other priorities, but damn it looks fun
[1:16:53] <+SoftBoiledBrains> the last metroid game i played was prime hunters on the DS
[1:16:56] <%RealThiele> @Reilata Chozo senitnel infected x 2 thats it
[1:17:00] <kikoeru_san> for like... 30 minutes then I went back to am2r
[1:17:08] <oneimportantthing> Favorite area coming up
[1:17:10] <IntenseNerdRage> so the worse one
[1:17:12] <+thelovingfool> lol
[1:17:12] <bobdoletrasher> huehue
[1:17:19] <Reilata> Ah kay, thanks!
[1:17:24] <+Jonesman64> I love this Game.. just beat it xD
[1:17:25] <+Ropcord> @Reilata also the X got out and immediately fucked the entire planet
[1:17:29] <+thelovingfool> that block fucks you big time
[1:17:31] <Reilata> LUL
[1:17:31] <bobdoletrasher> this is just a big "not yet" @WoolieVersus
[1:17:37] <+SoftBoiledBrains> Prime Hunters is pretty LIT
[1:17:42] <Shwepie> Trapped yourself.
[1:17:43] <+VictorVonLouche> appears to be a save point
[1:17:44] <+SoftBoiledBrains> if you were broke you could play download play with only 1 copy
[1:17:47] <+ShinobiPhoenix> your option is UP or to the new area
[1:17:51] <olaksi> didn't the scan show breakable blocks though

[1:17:58] <+ShinobiPhoenix> I would suggest Up actually
[1:18:15] <+ShinobiPhoenix> Up is something you should unlock
[1:18:16] <yuggie_the_shark> it all loops around
[1:18:35] <bazz_tv> I admit I still prefer AM2R over Returns, but is more about presentation and that I hate the 3ds
[1:18:36] <+SoftBoiledBrains> Woolie used to host these meetups for SF4 back in the day, I was lucky enough to go to some
[1:18:39] <+thelovingfool> shinobi he needs screw attack
[1:18:40] <+ShinobiPhoenix> unlocking loops is important
[1:18:45] <+SoftBoiledBrains> at this gross internet cafe but man if I could go back I would
[1:18:58] <+ShinobiPhoenix> not for the thing NEXT to the radar room
[1:19:09] <TenguGemini> All you need for that standing grapple is timing
[1:19:16] <bobdoletrasher> @WoolieVersus if only you could make that mushroom stand still
[1:19:20] <oneimportantthing> LOVE THIS GATE
[1:19:24] <+ShinobiPhoenix> everyone who got the Radar early did it in reverse
[1:19:30] <IntenseNerdRage> @woolieversus Little armor detail you might miss, but pay attention to the green stripes on Samus armor chest
[1:19:33] <Shwepie> Dog Chozo.
[1:19:40] <KasiCrafter> The mixups!
[1:19:44] <bobdoletrasher> just do a running slap
[1:19:49] <+SoftBoiledBrains> npc has layers to its combat
[1:20:00] <+Tucker0603> yo that dash....
[1:20:02] <TenguGemini> This room is driving me mad in my playthrough
[1:20:04] <Kaji04> oh he can totally get this one right now
[1:20:20] <+ShinobiPhoenix> if you got that radar early, that's how you got in was the thing Woolie should unlock now from the "correct" way
[1:20:23] <%BananaSlammuh> This one took me a bit
[1:20:26] <thackattack00> this one is bullshit
[1:20:29] <thunderborn32> a bit silly that fire hurts you in the heat suit
[1:20:33] <thackattack00> it took me so long to figure out
[1:20:33] <+Ropcord> these devs really love the shinespark and i am here for it
[1:20:39] <+thelovingfool> oh man fuck this puzzle
[1:20:42] <OfficerMods> u thought
[1:20:44] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> wait for it...
[1:20:44] <bobdoletrasher> @WoolieVersus dont press down, just slide
[1:20:48] <+ShinobiPhoenix> already messed up
[1:20:49] <%Prevot> YOU THOUGHT
[1:21:15] <OfficerMods> YOU THOUGHT
[1:21:18] <bobdoletrasher> hehehehhe
[1:21:18] <DoctorMulholland> Ah THIS one
[1:21:24] <+VictorVonLouche> This one is a PAIN
[1:21:24] <Kaji04> this one seems bs but it's fairly easy
[1:21:24] <+Ropcord> big brain time
[1:21:25] <%Prevot> Jebaited
[1:21:25] <yuggie_the_shark> this one is hard
[1:21:25] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1447814216103104512?t=FMN9Zf2S4JsthZvBIlfXDQ&s=19
[1:21:27] <%LastHazzerd> big brain time
[1:21:27] <%rindy0> this is a fun one
[1:21:28] <redwidow1358> Have fun with this one bro
[1:21:28] <DoctorMulholland> This is a fun one
[1:21:30] <bazz_tv> the dash on morph ball reminds me of the boost ball in prime
[1:21:33] <+ShinobiPhoenix> this WILL be the final item I get
[1:21:35] <TenguGemini> I've spent like 20 minutes trying to do this
[1:21:36] <+Jonesman64> MAN this one was ROUGH
[1:21:37] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> I LOVE THIS
[1:21:46] <+ShinobiPhoenix> I know HOW to get it, it's just work to do it
[1:21:54] <bobdoletrasher> slide
[1:21:57] <shotgang86> SHOOT
[1:21:58] <redwidow1358> The secret is that you can't do it yet
[1:22:02] <%Prevot> this one was rough for me, I watched a video and still couldn't understand it
[1:22:03] <+ShinobiPhoenix> I am hunting the other items first
[1:22:06] <+thelovingfool> can't right now wools
[1:22:07] <glass_marcus> no her totally can do it
[1:22:09] <thackattack00> nah you can do it now
[1:22:09] <Kaji04> he can do it right now
[1:22:10] <bobdoletrasher> @WoolieVersus dont press down
[1:22:13] <shotgang86> YES!
[1:22:20] <%rindy0> I wonder, does the later bomb upgrade make this easier?
[1:22:20] <+Traffun> slide
[1:22:22] <+ShinobiPhoenix> you CAN do it now, but it's WERK!
[1:22:27] <fistynopunches> this game really wants you to learn shinespark tech on your own
[1:22:29] <%LastHazzerd> woolie will figure it out (without backseats)
[1:22:31] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Tatakae Woolie
[1:22:36] <+ArcanumArcanum> @bobdoletrasher have you considered not telling him the solution and letting him figure it out?
[1:22:43] <bobdoletrasher> naw
[1:22:49] <+ArcanumArcanum> maybe you should
[1:22:55] <bobdoletrasher> naa
[1:23:01] <%tank7013> I think it's tight but you get just enough time to speed boost from the top part here
[1:23:04] <+Xeogred> glad he doesn't look at the chat for this
[1:23:09] <OfficerMods> visible look of confusion
[1:23:11] <SunsetJack> How can he do it?
[1:23:14] <+BeatsWithKev> thank goodness
[1:23:16] <+D00msDayDan> time for shinespark
[1:23:17] <SunsetJack> He is missing X.
[1:23:17] <Kaji04> sliding
[1:23:18] <churropoppa> @bobdoletrasher you seem fun at parties
[1:23:19] <redwidow1358> Yeah, you don't need to leave the room to charge, just wall jump off the door
[1:23:24] <oneimportantthing> I personally just gave up lol
[1:23:30] <CaptainBright> Telling him the solution is not the hard part ; it's the timing that is the hardest
[1:23:36] <KasiCrafter> How fast does a Speed Boosted slide go?
[1:23:38] <bobdoletrasher> @bobdoletrasher man fuck parties
[1:23:38] <omnishadeee> a normal slide wouldnt work yeah
[1:23:39] <+ShinobiPhoenix> @sunsetjack he's literally not missing anything for this
[1:23:41] <DoctorMulholland> Nah sliding is fast enough. Don't mean to backseat here, just saying in general.
[1:23:42] <+CammerTime21> i've seen two different solutions to this
[1:23:42] <%RealThiele> oh THIS puzzle
[1:23:43] <IntenseNerdRage> @sunsetjack there's two ways to do it, one requires a future upgrade the other is patience
[1:23:50] <+kumaprime> This one took a while for me
[1:23:52] <churropoppa> @bobdoletrasher COPIUM
[1:23:55] <Frazbeee> maybe morphball shinespark?
[1:24:02] <fistynopunches> some shinespark puzzles have more than one solution
[1:24:05] <bobdoletrasher> @bobdoletrasher ratio? dab?
[1:24:06] <zentzen> you can slide
[1:24:11] <+BeatsWithKev> Max had a slight issue with this too
[1:24:12] <Kaji04> it is doable rn
[1:24:15] <+ShinobiPhoenix> I would say this has 3 solutions
[1:24:17] <Blank9> there's a lot of solutions, definitely doable now
[1:24:20] <NiniGiovanini> IT IS
[1:24:21] <+D00msDayDan> you can walljump while speedboosting
[1:24:22] <omnishadeee> speedbooster is not as restrictive in this game remember
[1:24:24] <+ShinobiPhoenix> but he can do one right now
[1:24:25] <%Prevot> its doable
[1:24:25] <Vynith> it's doable
[1:24:30] <+Neoepochx> It is it is just one of the tricky ones
[1:24:32] <Shwepie> @CammerTime21 Was one of them with a later power up?
[1:24:49] <IntenseNerdRage> Yes
[1:24:52] <Kaji04> shine spark techs are bs to be fair
[1:24:58] <+Neoepochx> slide
[1:24:58] <%LastHazzerd> MorphSpark is sucha fun mechanic
[1:25:01] <bobdoletrasher> @WoolieVersus just dont press down :^)
[1:25:09] <+ShinobiPhoenix> @d00msdaydan Woolie is literally doing that in front of you
[1:25:10] <+Traffun> Its doable just think about your full kit
[1:25:13] <%RealThiele> Shineslide
[1:25:13] <Darren716> I can think of 2 later powers that I used on this one
[1:25:19] <Kaji04> you can wall jump and keep the boost it's just finnicky
[1:25:20] <oneimportantthing> @bobdoletrasher Dude stop
[1:25:22] <+ArcanumArcanum> @bobdoletrasher just stop commenting
[1:25:28] <greatspaceadventure> could you maybe shoot the blocks right before you land the wall jump?
[1:25:29] <omnishadeee> there are no later powerups u can use in this
[1:25:33] <NiniGiovanini> does telling him the answer counts as a spoiler
[1:25:38] <CoffeeShopA> I‚Äôm pretty sure this one is straight up impossible until later
[1:25:40] <bobdoletrasher> @bobdoletrasher everyone's saying it
[1:25:40] <Jnkolm> Impossible. How could streamer know how to do something without staring at a guide the whole time like chat does?
[1:25:41] <%tank7013> Yes
[1:25:41] <%Dr00_PhD> @NiniGiovanini yes
[1:25:47] <churropoppa> @NiniGiovanini yup
[1:25:48] <redwidow1358> But there is a later powerup you can use @omnishadeee
[1:25:48] <%fetrigon> @ninigiovanini yes
[1:25:50] <%rindy0> @omnishadeee doesn't the upgrade that starts with C help?
[1:25:52] <NiniGiovanini> ok
[1:25:55] <CaptainBright> gods, that timing is REAL hard for this one
[1:26:00] <%LastHazzerd> thank fuck he hardly looks at chat
[1:26:02] <NiniGiovanini> I will shut up then
[1:26:11] <omnishadeee> @omnishadeee makes very little difference
[1:26:16] <+ShinobiPhoenix> yes, it's actually good he KNOWS not to look at Chat
[1:26:20] <+thelovingfool> I literally only know the one way to get past those blocks
[1:26:29] <greatspaceadventure> i can think of at least 2
[1:26:32] <+Neoepochx> I do like how speed boost breaks beam blocks
[1:26:35] <%Deft_Thought> Man, how great would it be if someone's just watching Samus run around like a nut trying to figure out these puzzles
[1:26:38] <NiniGiovanini> he can do it now, it's just hard
[1:26:39] <oneimportantthing> So guys is the reward good for this one? I gave up myself lol
[1:26:48] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> Yeah it's worth it
[1:26:48] <greatspaceadventure> @Neoepochx has it not always done so? or am i misremembering
[1:26:50] <+ShinobiPhoenix> @thelovingfool there's 2 ways through the blocks
[1:26:54] <%LastHazzerd> more missiles, innit?
[1:26:55] <greatspaceadventure> it's a big reward
[1:26:56] <%rindy0> changing direciton normally loses the boost, you gotta wall jump
[1:26:58] <Kaji04> only wall jump keeps it
[1:26:58] <%Deft_Thought> "She... keeps running inside and then back out again?"
[1:26:59] <+LazyAss24Seven> its like the podcast, Woolie Will Figure It Out
[1:27:00] <kikoeru_san> can he slide in with the super speed?
[1:27:01] <+ShinobiPhoenix> actually 3 but one doesn't solve the problem
[1:27:02] <+thelovingfool> I think it's +10 missed?
[1:27:02] <redwidow1358> I don't remember the reward but I went for 100% completion so this reward wasn't on my mind
[1:27:03] <+Neoepochx> I'm not sure @greatspaceadventure
[1:27:06] <Shwepie> @oneimportantthing Missile Tank+
[1:27:07] <TenguGemini> you do lose it for double jumping backwards, yes
[1:27:10] <Darren716> Yeah this is a big missile
[1:27:11] <%tank7013> Oh woah
[1:27:12] <%rindy0> oooooh
[1:27:13] <%LastHazzerd> OHHHH
[1:27:13] <DracaenaLeaf> ooooooh
[1:27:14] <greatspaceadventure> @Deft_Thought OMEGALUL
[1:27:15] <bobdoletrasher> there we go
[1:27:15] <NiniGiovanini> almost
[1:27:15] <shotgang86> OOOOOOOH
[1:27:16] <%Prevot> wow
[1:27:16] <kikoeru_san> oh
[1:27:16] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> Almost!
[1:27:17] <Frazbeee> OH NO
[1:27:17] <emMmDeeKay> ALMOST
[1:27:17] <IntenseNerdRage> there it is
[1:27:18] <CaptainBright> and now the cogs turn
[1:27:18] <fairore> ooooo
[1:27:19] <%Vynith> yeah yeah yeah yeah
[1:27:19] <%LastHazzerd> it's working!
[1:27:19] <omnishadeee> thats how u do it
[1:27:19] <majindusto> Dammit
[1:27:20] <Kaji04> wait he kept the thing in morph ball??
[1:27:21] <@Menitta> ooooh that's good
[1:27:22] <%tank7013> Never seen that interaction
[1:27:23] <kikoeru_san> he has it now
[1:27:25] <oneimportantthing> OOOOH
[1:27:25] <+Neoepochx> yeah it is a 10 missle
[1:27:27] <%fetrigon> oooooooooooo atpRtsd
[1:27:27] <KasiCrafter> Ball tech~
[1:27:29] <NiniGiovanini> KEEP GOING YOU CAN DO IT LOVE
[1:27:31] <+Traffun> you had it
[1:27:31] <%RealThiele> he did it. . . mostly
[1:27:31] <zentzen> your wall jumping too early
[1:27:31] <%tank7013> How did he even do that
[1:27:35] <Jnkolm> oh he Big Woolie SparkMan
[1:27:36] <+ShinobiPhoenix> it's a Missile+
[1:27:37] <+Neoepochx> yes, you keep speed as a ball
[1:27:39] <fistynopunches> almost there
[1:27:40] <oneimportantthing> DON'T GIVE UP
[1:27:41] <TenguGemini> The timing on this is miserable
[1:27:41] <+megaman_sentinel> almost
[1:27:42] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @CoffeeShopA
[1:27:42] <%LastHazzerd> he's seen the light
[1:27:45] <Frazbeee> mid air motph?
[1:27:47] <%Vynith> Vynith subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! 
[1:27:50] <bobdoletrasher> @tank7013 slid into it
[1:27:50] <IntenseNerdRage> basically
[1:27:52] <kikoeru_san> Woolie WILL figure it out
[1:27:53] <shotgang86> curl up with ZL its quicker than double tapping
[1:27:55] <+ShinobiPhoenix> literally ALL of the hard Shinespark challenges are Missile+
[1:28:00] <+thelovingfool> ohhhhh
[1:28:03] <Kaji04> AYYYY
[1:28:03] <greatspaceadventure> ALMOST HAD IT
[1:28:12] <%rindy0> yeyeyeye
[1:28:15] <oneimportantthing> LOL this must look so silly if Raven Beak is watching this on a screen somewhere
[1:28:15] <NiniGiovanini> WOOLIE FIGURED IT OUT
[1:28:17] <CaptainBright> that's why I said telling Woolie the solution of this puzzle is not the problem; IT'S THE TIMING
[1:28:17] <%Vynith> yeeeeeeeeeah
[1:28:19] <%LastHazzerd> oh yeah, it's all coming together
[1:28:20] <%tank7013> @bobdoletrasher No he clearly morph balled into it
[1:28:20] <majindusto> Is this basically Machball?
[1:28:23] <redwidow1358> That's pretty much it yeah
[1:28:24] <DoctorMulholland> NEURON ACTIVITY
[1:28:25] <greatspaceadventure> this game has the best speed booster puzzles of any metroid, fite me
[1:28:26] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:28:26] <+ShinobiPhoenix> oh, Woolie ALMOST had it
[1:28:35] <+ShinobiPhoenix> he's thinking of the wrong thing now
[1:28:41] <kikoeru_san> you have to shoot the first set of block too don't you, I haven't played this yet
[1:28:45] <%LastHazzerd> this is like labbing in SNK
[1:28:49] <GarbageNirvana> Nah he can get it
[1:28:53] <+Xeogred> there's probably multiple solutions
[1:28:53] <bobdoletrasher> @tank7013 yea you can slide from spark and keep it into morph ball with out pressing down
[1:28:55] <DoctorMulholland> The timing is difficult but the thought process is there
[1:28:57] <Kaji04> he's got the main idea the only thing he's missing is the charge
[1:29:03] <omnishadeee> he knows what to do all hes gotta do now is execute it right
[1:29:05] <%rindy0> @kikoeru_san nah, everything breaks beam blocks
[1:29:06] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> I love Mercury Steam for this stuff
[1:29:08] <+ShinobiPhoenix> @xeogred there's literally 3 solutions
[1:29:10] <emMmDeeKay> Store it
[1:29:12] <shotgang86> yeyeyeye, and then there hit again ZL to start running again and then you can stock the shinespark
[1:29:20] <kikoeru_san> I see I see
[1:29:20] <shotgang86> and then you good to go
[1:29:22] <NiniGiovanini> I was not expecting fighting game terminology in my metroid
[1:29:23] <%tank7013> @bobdoletrasher I know but he's clearly not sliding
[1:29:41] <Kaji04> can you store it in morph ball mode?
[1:29:42] <shotgang86> you can unroll with ZL
[1:29:50] <+Neoepochx> You have to get back up to store it
[1:29:54] <+ShinobiPhoenix> @ninigiovanini This game literally has The Flash Kick
[1:29:57] <Kaji04> ayyyyyyyyyyy
[1:29:59] <shotgang86> THERE
[1:30:01] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> Now he's got it
[1:30:03] <+Neoepochx> yea
[1:30:04] <%Prevot> PogChamp
[1:30:08] <bobdoletrasher> YEEE
[1:30:10] <%rindy0> you can also double tap ZL to go from slide to ball
[1:30:15] <+Neoepochx> and you have enough time to bomb then spark
[1:30:16] <NiniGiovanini> @ShinobiPhoenix fair enough
[1:30:18] <kikoeru_san> lol L cancel
[1:30:18] <omnishadeee> u can store shinespark in morph too
[1:30:20] <+Traffun> He's got
[1:30:24] <+Neoepochx> you don't need to bomb on the way
[1:30:28] <shotgang86> you can do it!
[1:30:28] <+ShinobiPhoenix> you can chain Slide into ball into slide and such
[1:30:36] <+ShinobiPhoenix> it's ALSO how you Flash Kick
[1:30:45] <kikoeru_san> man's playing the wrong Nintendo game with these l cancels
[1:30:57] <Kaji04> can you slide all the way during boost? i feel that's how i did it
[1:30:57] <+Ropcord> just wavedash through the blocks it's easy
[1:30:58] <shotgang86> almooooost
[1:31:07] <%rindy0> wait, does shinespark break bomb blocks?
[1:31:12] <+Neoepochx> No
[1:31:12] <thackattack00> no
[1:31:16] <TenguGemini> I am oh this is the hardest thing to do in the entire game
[1:31:17] <%rindy0> yeah than he is missing a part
[1:31:22] <%rindy0> nvm he got it
[1:31:22] <+Neoepochx> just beam blocks
[1:31:22] <IntenseNerdRage> no, he's dropping bombs while speed boosting
[1:31:22] <TenguGemini> *imo
[1:31:26] <thackattack00> just speed boost blocks and beam blocks
[1:31:30] <%tank7013> @Kaji04 You totally can. that's how I did it as well
[1:31:31] <+ShinobiPhoenix> ALSO you can go from ball DIRECTLY into a Boosted Run if you hit Left Stick and ZL at the same time
[1:31:34] <bobdoletrasher> hold left
[1:31:38] <Blank9> so close
[1:31:38] <shotgang86> yeyeyeyeyeye
[1:31:40] <emMmDeeKay> don't stop holding
[1:31:47] <kikoeru_san> holy shit it IS a washdash input
[1:31:52] <kikoeru_san> well almost
[1:31:54] <+thelovingfool> oh yeah gotta keep going eh
[1:31:56] <Kaji04> @tank7013 yeah i didn't remember dealing with changing back
[1:31:57] <+ShinobiPhoenix> trust and believe, you should know that for a later Shinespark
[1:32:03] <+Neoepochx> need to keep moving
[1:32:05] <emMmDeeKay> dont stop holding that button
[1:32:10] <GarbageNirvana> Wouldn't it be simpler to just slide through the blocks there?
[1:32:15] <thackattack00> yes
[1:32:18] <+Neoepochx> Yes
[1:32:24] <%Prevot> pretty sure the way I did it was much easier LUL
[1:32:27] <+ShinobiPhoenix> @garbagenirvana oh...wouldn't it...?
[1:32:30] <kikoeru_san> that looked weird man
[1:32:35] <NoKingArthur> Yeah, you can slide, store it, then go bomp and shinespark up
[1:32:38] <bobdoletrasher> @Prevot this same one?
[1:32:41] <iamnotaparrot> you have to slide. going into morph kills it
[1:32:45] <omnishadeee> woolie, unless its a walljump ur gonna lose speedboost
[1:32:52] <omnishadeee> when u turn
[1:32:53] <bobdoletrasher> Z:
[1:32:55] <bobdoletrasher> zL
[1:32:56] <Kaji04> Don't stop
[1:33:01] <Shwepie> @Kaji04 Slide is longer while boosting, but not enough to make it through the tunnel.
[1:33:04] <Blank9> morph doesn't kill it
[1:33:10] <TenguGemini> I actually hate this puzzle because the timing is so ridiculously strict on it
[1:33:11] <OfficerMods> man can you imagine if you had to use these shine spark skills in a boss fight ha ha man that'd be wild
[1:33:16] <emMmDeeKay> don't stop holding that button when you cancel it
[1:33:18] <kikoeru_san> so he needs to keep running after unmorphing?
[1:33:20] <%Prevot> @shwepie it's totally enough
[1:33:21] <%rindy0> is he not aware of ZL?
[1:33:25] <+Neoepochx> Not sure
[1:33:30] <%Dr00_PhD> @Kaji04 yeah but if you don't hold the button you unmorph immediately
[1:33:30] <zentzen> just keep moving forward
[1:33:33] <kikoeru_san> he's using it
[1:33:34] <iamnotaparrot> I did this one by sliding and at the end you just hit down to store, then roll a little right and ballpark up
[1:33:34] <omnishadeee> u cant turn around during shinespark unless its from a walljump
[1:33:40] <+Xeogred> chat's so funny
[1:33:53] <shotgang86> I forgot he does not read chat anymore
[1:33:56] <+Neoepochx> Smug chatters are funny too
[1:33:56] <%LastHazzerd> the information and mis-information is all over
[1:33:57] <%Seancicle> oui?
[1:34:08] <+Xeogred> glad he's learning on his own
[1:34:08] <greatspaceadventure> gotta Zombieland that shit, double tap
[1:34:10] <+ArcanumArcanum> @TenguGemini it's not that strict. If woolie jumps off the wall lower he has more time to hit ZL to slide. If you use ZL to slide through, you auto unmorph on the other side making storing the spark easier. Then you roll to the bomb blocks, blow them up, and spark up
[1:34:15] <bobdoletrasher> but hold left on unroll @WoolieVersus
[1:34:16] <+ShinobiPhoenix> I will even say it's EASIER to wall jump BEFORE you get Spin Boost or Space Jump because the game prioritizes them over Wall Jump
[1:34:17] <%Prevot> I assume the way woolies trying is possible, just really tough
[1:34:28] <Kaji04> yeah i think he's just making it harder on himself
[1:34:40] <%LastHazzerd> is this game gonna evoke tekken fingers
[1:34:42] <omnishadeee> @Prevot this is the right way he is just stuck on the last step
[1:34:46] <zentzen> dont stop moving
[1:34:49] <+ShinobiPhoenix> I am glad Woolie is figuring it out for himself
[1:34:56] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> It's fine take your time
[1:34:57] <kikoeru_san> so can he keep the charge if keeps running out of the morphball
[1:34:59] <thackattack00> it's fine
[1:34:59] <DracaenaLeaf> don't worry about it
[1:35:00] <Kaji04> it's fine, watching tech learning is cool
[1:35:03] <+thelovingfool> keep moving when uncurling?
[1:35:05] <shotgang86> he needs to actually run a little to stock it
[1:35:06] <thackattack00> it took me a long time too
[1:35:06] <%tank7013> Nah this is part of the game it's fine
[1:35:06] <greatspaceadventure> no time is wasted when enjoying the fuck out of a new Metroid game
[1:35:06] <%LastHazzerd> this isn't wasted time, this is labbing
[1:35:13] <%Prevot> @omnishadeee it's not the only way for sure, cause I did different
[1:35:15] <+Traffun> keep moving after unmorph and then store shine
[1:35:20] <+Neoepochx> that is right
[1:35:21] <+ShinobiPhoenix> I will also say what the game does DURING Boost is DIFFERENT from what it allows outside of Boost
[1:35:26] <Kaji04> keep moving forward before storing
[1:35:26] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:35:28] <+Neoepochx> you just gotta keep moving
[1:35:31] <bobdoletrasher> keep holding that side
[1:35:34] <Frazbeee> maybe keep goin left then walljump back?
[1:35:35] <shotgang86> !MOTIVATED
[1:35:35] <@Moobot> @shotgang86 2317 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[1:35:47] <greatspaceadventure> the game is really forgiving with analog inputs tbh, they did a really good job with that without sacrificing the skill curve
[1:35:49] <bazz_tv> oh man i missed the solution
[1:35:49] <zentzen> it is but you dont stop
[1:36:00] <omnishadeee> u will store shinespark as long as ur holding down, but if u press back to any degree it will cancel speedboost
[1:36:03] <Kaji04> it's forward then down
[1:36:05] <emMmDeeKay> Good Job
[1:36:12] <+ShinobiPhoenix> HADOKEN motion
[1:36:13] <%LastHazzerd> oh yeah, it's big brain time
[1:36:19] <Jnkolm> he be gettin' closer
[1:36:21] <+thelovingfool> forward then down
[1:36:26] <kikoeru_san> it's a wavedash input LUL LUL
[1:36:41] <greatspaceadventure> vineLUL
[1:36:43] <omnishadeee> u can store in ball, dont need to unmorph
[1:36:43] <+Traffun> 4 2 not 1
[1:36:49] <essence_of_lariatto> I did absolutely none of this for
[1:36:53] <NiniGiovanini> ok NOW woolie figured it out
[1:36:55] <oneimportantthing> Holy fuck the reward better be worth it
[1:36:56] <bobdoletrasher> you can come out and still run
[1:37:00] <greatspaceadventure> spineshark is stored in the ball
[1:37:05] <Kaji04> let's fucking goooooooooo
[1:37:07] <%tank7013> Needlessly complicated, but very cool
[1:37:11] <+ShinobiPhoenix> but what he's focusing on doesn't really help with this, but maybe he'll find it as a fourth solution
[1:37:15] <greatspaceadventure> anyone else love the music in this game as much as i do???
[1:37:22] <Frazbeee> it better be something cool
[1:37:24] <+FuqBoiSlim> it's a metroid game he's doing all this for like 5 missiles or some shit lmao. love it tho
[1:37:24] <greatspaceadventure> especially in the EMMI areas
[1:37:34] <%rindy0> wait you don't need to unroll to get shinespark? lmao I did it wrong too than
[1:37:51] <%LastHazzerd> it really is the fighting game lab
[1:37:55] <greatspaceadventure> this is one puzzle where you can actually flub the input a bit and still nail it
[1:37:57] <+Neoepochx> I think the music is probably the weakest in the series, tbh. probably the biggest weakness of the game.
[1:37:57] <essence_of_lariatto> You don't need to roll to get shinespark, just crouch
[1:38:04] <+ShinobiPhoenix> obviously the way people are talking about involving the Space Jump double Wall Jump, but technically this way is EASIER than that
[1:38:05] <glass_marcus> This will be an entire episode on the channel
[1:38:07] <+thelovingfool> there's no doing it wrong, just alternatives
[1:38:09] <Kaji04> im very certain you can just slide all the way thru
[1:38:29] <shotgang86> to be fair this is one of the hardest pickups of this game
[1:38:32] <%BananaSlammuh> @neoepochx agreed. Some nice atmospheric and a couple nice melodic but weaker than most other Metroids imo
[1:38:33] <omnishadeee> even if u use the space jump here u cant destroy the speedbooster blocks with a spacejump
[1:38:37] <%rindy0> you automatically morphball when you slide for long enough
[1:38:38] <+ShinobiPhoenix> frankly, I can't believe he's doing a Boosted Ball Run at all
[1:38:47] <%tank7013> Wall jumping definitely gets a little finnicky in speed boost. Can't blame him for missing those
[1:38:52] <mothdude> WOW
[1:38:53] <%rindy0> YEYEYEYE
[1:38:54] <+Xeogred> 10/10

[1:39:13] <+Traffun> Well Done!
[1:39:13] <kikoeru_san> WOOLIE HAS FIGURED IT OUT
[1:39:14] <NiniGiovanini> big missiles
[1:39:15] <Shwepie> ennsGolf
[1:39:15] <oneimportantthing> This is so hype
[1:39:17] <CoffeeShopA> That was incredible!
[1:39:19] <%Prevot> so this is MUCH easier if you just slide while speed boosting LUL
[1:39:21] <+megaman_sentinel> first try
[1:39:24] <cassiecagedd> HECK YEAH WOOOOOLLS
[1:39:33] <+jbfelder> Damn what happened, just joined
[1:39:34] <+Neoepochx> I think there are like 3 Shine Spark Puzzles that are actually kinda tricky.
[1:39:41] <%tank7013> For future reference just speed sliding would have totally worked there. I think Woolie's way was cooler though
[1:39:41] <%Prevot> no complicated inputs necessary LUL
[1:39:47] <Darren716> Oh yeah one of the coolest weapons is coming up
[1:39:49] <+ShinobiPhoenix> that caught me by surprise too
[1:39:59] <bazz_tv> oh boy Xs
[1:40:00] <bobdoletrasher> more rockets
[1:40:01] <+VictorVonLouche> Kill it
[1:40:05] <Shwepie> @Prevot Can you really slide all the way through? I always got stuck into a ball near the end.
[1:40:06] <thackattack00> kill it
[1:40:07] <+ShinobiPhoenix> there's a much WORSE version of that attack later that had me scarred
[1:40:09] <oneimportantthing> Woolie's overly clunky methid was actully a helluva lot more sick to watch
[1:40:10] <+Neoepochx> keep hitting it
[1:40:10] <omnishadeee> dont know hwy people giving woolie shit its just a tough puzzle thats the only way to do it
[1:40:13] <essence_of_lariatto> you were doing damage
[1:40:13] <+thelovingfool> melee frozen enemies woolie
[1:40:18] <shotgang86> woolie... woolie you can kill it
[1:40:20] <+Traffun> some mooks need 3 rockets
[1:40:29] <Kaji04> touch it, gotta feel that texture
[1:40:31] <+VictorVonLouche> X parasites make ALL enemies stronger
[1:40:53] <%tank7013> @Shwepie Yea it auto balls you but you keep boost. After you exit all you gotta do is press down and you store the shinespark
[1:41:10] <+Tucker0603> !uptime
[1:41:11] <@Moobot> @Tucker0603 WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 54 minutes
[1:41:26] <%Prevot> @shwepie you can slide all the way without going into ball mode at all
[1:41:32] <metabot64> so im guessing by the youtube video that woolie is into bird people now?
[1:41:46] <omnishadeee> @Prevot no u cannot lol
[1:41:56] <oneimportantthing> Hahahahah GOOD LUCK
[1:41:58] <%Prevot> I literally did it yesterday
[1:41:58] <OfficerMods> oh this one
[1:42:03] <thackattack00> this one is annoying
[1:42:07] <OfficerMods> i don't bother with this one at this point in the game
[1:42:10] <+ShinobiPhoenix> I totally didn't bomb jump this
[1:42:10] <OfficerMods> you CAN do it
[1:42:14] <OfficerMods> but its so hard
[1:42:20] <+ShinobiPhoenix> I didn't Power Bomb either
[1:42:22] <shotgang86> this one is not worth it doing it now
[1:42:24] <+VictorVonLouche> You might wanna wait on this one.
[1:42:29] <Darren716> Yeah I said fuck this and PB it
[1:42:29] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:42:38] <+ShinobiPhoenix> it's way less frustrating to wait
[1:42:39] <+BeatsWithKev> pro gama strat
[1:42:43] <OfficerMods> oh wow thats close
[1:42:43] <+thelovingfool> I just wall jump into morph ball
[1:42:46] <OfficerMods> thats REALLY close
[1:42:49] <+ShinobiPhoenix> it's just a 2 Missile
[1:42:55] <oneimportantthing> Woolie please look at the chat, do it later
[1:42:56] <kikoeru_san> love how there's just a whole ladder on the wall, but Samus just won't acknowledge it
[1:43:01] <%LastHazzerd> you wanna learn how to do a fuckin' infinite
[1:43:04] <$NitronStreams> LIGHT PUNCH
[1:43:04] <%LastHazzerd> @oneimportantthing hell no
[1:43:07] <Kaji04> We got a good rythm going
[1:43:11] <metabot64> this is some sorta beat
[1:43:11] <%fetrigon> @oneimportantthing woolie way
[1:43:15] <cassiecagedd> FEEL THE RYTHEM
[1:43:19] <shotgang86> shut up chat you learning how to do an infinite
[1:43:20] <+D00msDayDan> you should wait for this one or you'll be at it for hours
[1:43:20] <Frazbeee> this ones a vitch
[1:43:21] <Shwepie> Bombs are pretty generous in how they bounce you in this game. Easiest bomb jumping I've ever experienced.
[1:43:22] <metabot64> is it possible to rap to this
[1:43:30] <OfficerMods> straight up its like doing an infinite
[1:43:33] <+BeatsWithKev> samus be independent, she don't need no ladder
[1:43:41] <+Neoepochx> There are easy ways
[1:43:44] <OfficerMods> it even changes the tempo at the very end
[1:43:45] <rios> @oneimportantthing No.
[1:43:45] <+VictorVonLouche> Really not worth doing it for TWO missiles
[1:43:45] <+D00msDayDan> all 3 of those blocks are bomb blocks so good luck
[1:43:48] <DoctorMulholland> I spent a good few minutes trying on this one but it aint happening man
[1:43:48] <+ArcanumArcanum> If only there was some sort of bomb with Power that could help here
[1:43:48] <+Traffun> maybe shinespark?
[1:43:48] <Kaji04> can this one be done?
[1:43:50] <oneimportantthing> @fetrigon Infinite it is then
[1:43:54] <kikoeru_san> woolie say "fuck easy mode"
[1:44:02] <+ArcanumArcanum> @Traffun shinespark doesn't break bomb blocks
[1:44:05] <+Slattsquatch> Genuinely curious if this one can be done at this point
[1:44:06] <+MagiKestral> is this how yall do bomb jumps? I spam a lot lol
[1:44:08] <Frazbeee> is there spiderball in this game?
[1:44:08] <kikoeru_san> that's insane
[1:44:14] <shotgang86> WELP
[1:44:16] <+ArcanumArcanum> @Frazbeee no
[1:44:16] <+BBQPaintchips> no spiderball
[1:44:23] <OfficerMods> no spiderball
[1:44:24] <Frazbeee> this is bullshit then
[1:44:26] <oneimportantthing> Woof this is the worst
[1:44:26] <kikoeru_san> this feels like a spiderball thing
[1:44:26] <Blank9> @MagiKestral I spring ball first to get a head start
[1:44:28] <shotgang86> looks like we staying here for a while boys
[1:44:34] <+Neoepochx> there is a bomb upgrade you can get
[1:44:41] <+Gorgodrn> The true metroid experience
[1:44:43] <+Neoepochx> that isn't super bomb
[1:44:44] <%LastHazzerd> oh wait, are samus' morph bombs ice now?
[1:44:44] <+spawnzie> there 's an item that lets you do this easier
[1:44:45] <DracaenaLeaf> close
[1:44:45] <dukenux> vod watchers rewind 6 hours
[1:44:49] <kikoeru_san> NO
[1:44:49] <Blank9> my god
[1:44:50] <+ArcanumArcanum> this is intended to be done with Power Bombs. Or maybe with the other bomb upgrade in the game
[1:44:51] <+LazyAss24Seven> Ahhh close!
[1:44:51] <shotgang86> YOU MADMAN
[1:44:51] <thackattack00> Damn so close
[1:44:53] <$NitronStreams> NOOOOOOO
[1:44:53] <dukenux> DAMN
[1:44:53] <mothdude> The intention is to come back with a later powerup for this one
[1:44:53] <%LastHazzerd> OH MY GOD
[1:44:54] <+Tucker0603> NOOOOOOO
[1:44:54] <Frazbeee> NAGE
[1:44:55] <Kaji04> holy shit
[1:44:55] <oneimportantthing> Raven Beak: "where the fuck is she"
[1:44:56] <%RealThiele> LUL
[1:44:57] <omnishadeee> woolie this is way easier later
[1:44:57] <OfficerMods> you hate to see it drop one input before the super
[1:44:57] <dukenux> almost
[1:44:59] <kikoeru_san> DOABLE
[1:45:01] <olaksi> this doesn't seem worth it
[1:45:01] <DoctorMulholland> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
[1:45:03] <Warbot40> IT'S DOABLE!?!
[1:45:04] <%fetrigon> fuuuuuuuuuuuck
[1:45:05] <%LastHazzerd> i've never seen someone break them all with bomb jumping
[1:45:05] <MayShip> i would never be able to do this
[1:45:08] <+BBQPaintchips> I'm cheering over here LUL
[1:45:11] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Just do it perfect, easy
[1:45:11] <+Gorgodrn> It's always worth it
[1:45:11] <$NitronStreams> DON'T LET THAT SHIT DROP
[1:45:12] <Gelphaze> denied
[1:45:12] <%tank7013> There are a couple of annoying bomb blocks in this game where they want you to do it in the air. One of them is even intended path progression
[1:45:16] <+spawnzie> Get those 2 missiles man
[1:45:17] <oneimportantthing> I've never seen this level of determination
[1:45:19] <+OroOreo> no man
[1:45:21] <NotHereToStream> keep the rhythm up
[1:45:23] <NiniGiovanini> the more advanced way of bomb jump is actually easier in this game. Try doing it with 2 bombs
[1:45:26] <shotgang86> why did it had to show woolie its doable now this man won't drop it thats insane
[1:45:29] <kikoeru_san> call him Woolie "Nathan Explosion" Madden
[1:45:36] <%Nested_Dreams> Are those brain goblins? In Woolie's stream?
[1:45:37] <Qu1ckyyy> Is this Exceed practice?
[1:45:39] <+HakureiIllusion> Adam: "Samus have you forgot about the damn mission"
[1:45:41] <+NickHatesSnow> She gets paid to do this, this is her job
[1:45:44] <%heyitsbrian> Woolie "Will Figure it out" Madden!!
[1:45:50] <oneimportantthing> I admire your steadfastness Woolz
[1:45:57] <%LastHazzerd> this is some galaxy brain shit
[1:45:57] <+spawnzie> wonder what Raven Beak's up to
[1:45:59] <Blank9> this is awesome I want to see it done
[1:46:00] <OfficerMods> is this what chozo children do for fun?
[1:46:02] <iamnotaparrot> Samus, you're on the clock
[1:46:11] <Vertigheist> samus on over time
[1:46:11] <kikoeru_san> boy you gotta stop
[1:46:14] <olaksi> 2 missiles
[1:46:15] <+Gorgodrn> Raven Beak is actually watching Samus on video LUL
[1:46:18] <shotgang86> its not worth it darlington
[1:46:24] <redwidow1358> I don't believe this is feasible. Possible maybe, but it's a huge waste.

[1:48:14] <OfficerMods> Timing reminds me tap troupe from rythm heaven
[1:48:16] <TheHotStuven> Could have pressed L to grab ledge

[1:48:18] <oneimportantthing> DONT YOU DARE GIVE UP
[1:48:19] <AdrianBauer> i believe in you
[1:48:20] <+Slattsquatch> SO CLOSE NotLikeThis
[1:48:20] <$NitronStreams> YOU COULD TASTE IT
[1:48:20] <Blank9> the missiles aren't the reward, the reward is doing something awesome
[1:48:21] <+thelovingfool> at that point just wall jump lol
[1:48:24] <eldrich_horror> respect if he gets it this way
[1:48:26] <OldManDeckardCain> pat will probably spend an entire stream here LUL
[1:48:28] <%LastHazzerd> LUL
[1:48:31] <3Xgilly> are you feeling DREAD?!
[1:48:33] <StarMechV> It's not about the missiles it's about sending a message.
[1:48:35] <JaruLee83> did I come at a bad time jammed1BabyLUL
[1:48:36] <%LastHazzerd> "I don't know, i didn't think i'd get this far"
[1:48:39] <+mufasamonk> they come back?
[1:48:44] <oneimportantthing> This is the true Dread
[1:48:50] <+LazyAss24Seven> bring the beat back!
[1:48:50] <%GeneralSCPatton> This is rough
[1:48:54] <@Menitta> Is this actually the solution lmao
[1:49:00] <NotHereToStream> vod watchers skip 2 hrs Kappa
[1:49:01] <kikoeru_san> Skibadee skibadanger I AM THE REARANGER
[1:49:04] <redwidow1358> This is not the "real" solution but it works
[1:49:05] <%tank7013> There no way LUL
[1:49:06] <yuggie_the_shark> am I a filthy normie for just coming back for all the items after I got all the powerups?
[1:49:08] <oneimportantthing> @menitta It sure is one solution lmao
[1:49:09] <Darren716> Nah the real solution is wayyy later
[1:49:09] <%rindy0> you get upgrades later on that make it piss easy
[1:49:10] <%LastHazzerd> the devs have gone on record saying that bomb jumping is never mandatory
[1:49:12] <glass_marcus> THIS is content
[1:49:12] <shotgang86> EMMI on my back? I sleep. 2 missiles upgrade? REAL SHIT
[1:49:14] <DevinMayCry> @Menitta Its AN solution. Theres a few depending on what you got
[1:49:16] <KasiCrafter> The HYPEST bomb jumps on twitch
[1:49:16] <@Menitta> LUL
[1:49:16] <+LazyAss24Seven> He's beginning to believe...
[1:49:17] <bigb00gi3> this is fine
[1:49:17] <mothdude> There is an easier way if you come back with more powerups but this is doable.
[1:49:17] <olaksi> need those 2 missiles NOW
[1:49:18] <$NitronStreams> We in the lab now boys
[1:49:19] <Blank9> there's other solutions but woolie's done better already
[1:49:19] <+A0N33> Yeah no I agree with Woolie here
[1:49:20] <marumariball> u got this
[1:49:22] <Deasmeister> I spent much longer and made much less progress before giving up
[1:49:23] <Treasure_Vault> don't apologize, call any viewer who doesn't like this a coward
[1:49:24] <NiniGiovanini> am I on a Pat stream?
[1:49:27] <+NickHatesSnow> NGL, this is exactly the content I came to see
[1:49:27] <redwidow1358> If Woolie had just backtracked with a new item later this would be over in three seconds
[1:49:29] <%ekodrop> keep the rhythm up
[1:49:29] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1447814216103104512?t=FMN9Zf2S4JsthZvBIlfXDQ&s=19
[1:49:31] <Tnecniv_DG> This is a high IQ solution and I'm excited to see this
[1:49:32] <kikoeru_san> he's motivated
[1:49:34] <+thelovingfool> @menitta there's a item that solves this instantly
[1:49:36] <oneimportantthing> Woolie NOBODY is blaming you, we want the same thing
[1:49:37] <shotgang86> I'm here for this
[1:49:39] <+VictorVonLouche> Right dont get depressed on literally the next power up that makes this trivial.
[1:49:41] <Vertigheist> now this is metroid
[1:49:42] <+Exicuren> This is what metroid is all about
[1:49:43] <%LastHazzerd> this! this right here!? THIS is Metroid
[1:49:47] <Ethel9727> Woolie showing his motivation
[1:49:51] <kikoeru_san> this is the most Virgil shit woolie has done
[1:49:52] <+Gorgodrn> It's not about there being an upgrade that helps, it's about being able to do it
[1:49:52] <Deasmeister> Now he's feeling motivated
[1:49:57] <+karsius> you can just do this section much easier later on
[1:49:58] <JaruLee83> oh...
[1:49:58] <+NickHatesSnow> Woolie anybody watching Metroid WANT THIS
[1:50:00] <Blank9> no one wants to do it easier, they want to do it now and harder
[1:50:03] <jorniev> OK no he got to close to drop it now
[1:50:04] <churropoppa> M O T I V A T E D
[1:50:06] <redwidow1358> Glad I missed absolutely nothing while I was cooking
[1:50:08] <%fetrigon> oh shit
[1:50:08] <Frazbeee> inb4 entire stream spent on woolie getting 2 missle tanks
[1:50:11] <oneimportantthing> The real dread is right herr
[1:50:16] <DevinMayCry> Worth it
[1:50:17] <%fetrigon> !MOTIVATED
[1:50:17] <@Moobot> @fetrigon 2318 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[1:50:19] <$NitronStreams> When you get so close its more disappointing to walk away
[1:50:21] <Ethel9727> "No Dante, this is not wacky wahoo pizza game, I must complete this bomb jump."
[1:50:26] <%LastHazzerd> Bomb Jumping sequence breaking is crack
[1:50:27] <NiniGiovanini> watch the normal solution for this to come up in 15 minutes
[1:50:28] <kikoeru_san> literally all I'm here for is this, and I MEAN it
[1:50:31] <Kaji04> this is the real metroid gameplay right here lets fucking go
[1:50:31] <+VictorVonLouche> Quick someone DM pat so he can mock woolie for this nonsense.
[1:50:35] <bazz_tv> the rythim change is a Nightmare
[1:50:40] <oneimportantthing> This is bizarrely entertaining
[1:50:40] <%NeonxSkies> !MOTIVATED
[1:50:41] <Vertigheist> bob your head for the rhythm
[1:50:43] <+HakureiIllusion> Everyone give Woolie your energy
[1:50:45] <kikoeru_san> Pat might be here RIGHT NIW
[1:50:45] <shotgang86> OH thats when it gets weird, GOT IT
[1:50:46] <+thelovingfool> fucking sunk cost falucy is a bitch
[1:50:52] <Blank9> the double time bomb bounces you too, so it needs to be right at the ceiling so it doesn't desync you
[1:50:53] <+insanestephen> I appreciate the commitment to playing this as if no one is watching
[1:50:58] <KasiCrafter> Since the net movement is 1 block higher each time, I think the riming of transitioning to double time is relatively easy to predict
[1:51:00] <+Daigrey> keep the rhythm up!
[1:51:01] <redwidow1358> Nobody is watching
[1:51:09] <kikoeru_san> I can feel Pat lurking, just laughing his ass off at this
[1:51:10] <reonome> oh god he's still here
[1:51:13] <HereComestheChief> TakeNRG
[1:51:14] <OfficerMods> @thelovingfool it has nothing to do with that, getting the timing down is intrensic fun
[1:51:15] <Blank9> I'm watching and I want it this way
[1:51:17] <Ethel9727> Girls are in fact watching so keep that in mind Woolie
[1:51:25] <bazz_tv> what is the normal solution anyway?
[1:51:28] <+Gorgodrn> Nooo
[1:51:29] <yuggie_the_shark> "finally, he got that shinespark puzzle, not the stream can move on" - me ten minutes ago
[1:51:31] <$NitronStreams> Fuck
[1:51:36] <bazz_tv> screw attack?
[1:51:38] <oneimportantthing> Woolie had zero rhythm in Yakuza 0, but is a god in this
[1:51:39] <Deasmeister> @redwidow1358 I thought girls were always watching though
[1:51:42] <%MegadBlitz> wait does the "girls might be watching" line even work now that these boys are married?
[1:51:50] <kikoeru_san> he's gonna get the FUCK outta this
[1:51:53] <%rindy0> hot AI boys are watching
[1:51:56] <redwidow1358> It isn't the availability, but the embarrassment
[1:51:57] <+Gorgodrn> If you land on it it'll break when you try to break the next one though
[1:52:03] <kikoeru_san> Adam is watching
[1:52:05] <KasiCrafter> Girls are always watching since it's Samus doing it Kappa
[1:52:08] <%rindy0> "what the fuck are you doing lady?"
[1:52:08] <oneimportantthing> For honor? For glory?
[1:52:09] <mothdude> Cool buff bird men are watching
[1:52:09] <TheHotStuven> Hot chozo babes are watching
[1:52:12] <SunsetJack> Do or die.
[1:52:13] <%MegadBlitz> ADAM is watching samus come on

[1:52:19] <+thelovingfool> birgil is watching
[1:52:20] <thegreatestsos> PAIN
[1:52:26] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Is this even possible?
[1:52:28] <%LastHazzerd> the X are watching
[1:52:31] <%rindy0> it super is
[1:52:31] <Tnecniv_DG> ADAM better be cheering on Samus for this
[1:52:35] <+SunnySideX> goblin pls

[1:52:37] <oneimportantthing> Raven Beak: *dies of old age*
[1:52:37] <kikoeru_san> Adam is probably just wondering the fuck he's playing her for
[1:52:39] <+Demoli_PT> you cant do it atm
[1:52:40] <Blank9> it's possible, woolie's had it twice
[1:52:43] <$NitronStreams> He did it already he just missed the itwm
[1:52:47] <DevinMayCry> @BallerSwagBro9k Woolie literally had it but was so focused on jumping he couldnt hold right to get it
[1:52:49] <$NitronStreams> item
[1:52:55] <+thelovingfool> you can do it, lady, get that 2 missles
[1:53:01] <+VictorVonLouche> Has Woolie literally played for 20 minutes TOTAL getting stuck on TWO unrequired pieces one requiring another upgrade to do..........
[1:53:08] <NiniGiovanini> I BELIEVE IN YOU, LOVE
[1:53:12] <TheFranss> this is gonna be one episode in youtube aint it LUL this bomb sound will get stuck in my head
[1:53:12] <+kewlmyc> Didn't know Woolie found the secret boss
[1:53:15] <Deasmeister> Adam be like I told you to embrace helplessness
[1:53:16] <iamnotaparrot> okay this is kinda wack but as soon as he gets it it's gonna be the most hype popoff ever for those 2 missiles
[1:53:17] <+Ropcord> @NotHereToStream vineGoblinpls

[1:53:18] <kikoeru_san> @victorvonlouche you love to see it though

[1:54:46] <redwidow1358> The thing is, this stream will be as long as the last one, and 80% will be this
[1:54:46] <DevinMayCry> All streams should have a timer to pretend its a speedrun
[1:54:48] <Treasure_Vault> only real gamers can do this

[1:55:00] <+D00msDayDan> snailtroid shelld
[1:55:02] <yuggie_the_shark> it's a challenge
[1:55:03] <+blankwaffle> no spoilers but he totally needs an upgrade for this
[1:55:06] <reonome> is this pat's mind goblins stream
[1:55:11] <+VictorVonLouche> There is an UPGRADE for this
[1:55:13] <%fetrigon> da hunger
[1:55:13] <Blank9> he doesn't need an upgrade, he can get it
[1:55:14] <+thecowpow> the constant bomb sounds is digging into my brain
[1:55:15] <CaptainBright> Is this how Woolie secretly edges to please PunchWife /s
[1:55:17] <+AmanDotZip> NOOOOOOO
[1:55:17] <%LastHazzerd> i like this bit, keep the bit
[1:55:18] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Woolie this isnt the solution tho.
[1:55:25] <+kewlmyc> @VictorVonLouche He doesn't care
[1:55:27] <glass_marcus> Pat isn't slaying his mind goblins, he's just transferring them to woolie
[1:55:27] <SunsetJack> So cool.
[1:55:28] <bazz_tv> how do you adapt the timing though ?
[1:55:28] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> HE CAN DO IT I BELIEVE
[1:55:29] <Darren716> It is A solution
[1:55:30] <$NitronStreams> The frustrating thing is that he fucking HAD IT but just barely missed getting the item
[1:55:31] <OfficerMods> physically unable to let it go, bless
[1:55:31] <+TitaniumDragoonNeo> @thelovingfool I guess this stream is going until 10 PM or later then Kappa
[1:55:33] <+VictorVonLouche> people stop enabling this goblin
[1:55:33] <%rindy0> "you get to finish once I get these missiles"
[1:55:35] <oneimportantthing> @ballerswagbro9k It's one solution though
[1:55:36] <KasiCrafter> I think double time starts as SOON as you end up below the first block
[1:55:38] <shotgang86> I'm going to listen to the bomb sound in my fucking sleep
[1:55:40] <iamnotaparrot> DONT STOP. YOU CAN DO IT
[1:55:42] <Deasmeister> On the plus side if Woolie gets it pat will have to lol
[1:55:44] <DevinMayCry> It literally is tho. If he can get it, then its the solution
[1:55:48] <kikoeru_san> Woolie Vs Metroid Dread part 4: Just A Few More Tries

[1:55:55] <Blank9> seriously how can no one understand this isn't about a checklist, it's about doing a challenge you can do
[1:56:00] <+VictorVonLouche> I hope pat grills you for this in the podcast
[1:56:07] <+Gorgodrn> The time changes once you pass the first block yeah
[1:56:08] <@Menitta> it's like 1/3rd time
[1:56:12] <redwidow1358> I hope this clip just gets memes on forever
[1:56:17] <SunsetJack> Dood, I would choke so hard when I would reach the block.
[1:56:18] <bazz_tv> that sounds hard as hell
[1:56:19] <$NitronStreams> THIS IS THE METROID EXPERIENCE
[1:56:20] <oneimportantthing> Peak Neurotic Millennial Woolie
[1:56:20] <redwidow1358> memed*
[1:56:21] <NiniGiovanini> I can't judge him, I do the same in Super Metroid
[1:56:23] <%LastHazzerd> Infinite bomb jumping is never the intended solution, but it is the elite solution
[1:56:27] <shotgang86> its not worth it wools, there is an upgrade later that trivializes this.
[1:56:30] <Carlioo> m≈ç ikkai!
[1:56:31] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:56:34] <kikoeru_san> the subreddit is furiously making memes
[1:56:36] <KasiCrafter> It's about the HYPE tho
[1:56:36] <dukenux> varg1
[1:56:40] <@Menitta> because the bomb is gonna still hit you up against the block and you'll go down sooner
[1:56:41] <Darren716> Nah at this point he has to do it
[1:56:43] <Blank9> why would you want to trivialize a fun challenge
[1:56:43] <redwidow1358> No, Moobot, I am not enjoying the stream
[1:56:44] <bobdoletrasher> you think samus' suit pushes the vomit back in?
[1:56:49] <Darren716> If he doesn't he's a coward
[1:56:50] <+thelovingfool> is it hype tho
[1:56:53] <Blank9> that's like summoning another player on a dark souls boss first try
[1:56:53] <+Tucker0603> thenoiDgrin yeah this gonna be a while
[1:56:53] <+thelovingfool> is it
[1:56:57] <oneimportantthing> After 20 minutes of this you really just have to keep going
[1:56:58] <omnishadeee> hes still going holy
[1:56:58] <iamnotaparrot> it's the hypest
[1:57:04] <CoffeeShopA> I want him to do this so bad
[1:57:04] <+kewlmyc> Jokes aside, there is something commendable about breaking a brick wall with bloody hands
[1:57:05] <sh2neely> He's going to get it, and it'll be hype when he does
[1:57:07] <+Gorgodrn> In Prime 3 she takes the helmet off to vomit so no
[1:57:09] <TheHotStuven> I loved watching woolie do the speedbooster puzzle so this is great
[1:57:10] <CoffeeShopA> He must win!
[1:57:11] <+ElDragon_1> It‚Äôs not about getting the upgrade. It‚Äôs about doing it like this.
[1:57:12] <%ekodrop> i could watch this all day
[1:57:13] <%LastHazzerd> Yeyeyeyeye~!
[1:57:16] <NiniGiovanini> he should try double bombs. it's way faster and a lot easier than one bomb at a time
[1:57:18] <+VictorVonLouche> Wheres (DONT)Punchwife to end this madness
[1:57:25] <kikoeru_san> @gorgodrn I forgot about that part

[1:58:45] <Shwepie> Did Woolie just sequence break because of a missile tank?
[1:58:45] <DevinMayCry> This game has great sequence breaks and they reward you for it
[1:58:45] <Treasure_Vault> Ok so it was worth
[1:58:46] <@Menitta> amazing
[1:58:46] <kikoeru_san> watch him kill the boss with 2 missiles at the end
[1:58:47] <+TitaniumDragoonNeo> SEQUENCE BREEEEEEAK

[1:58:58] <+Exicuren> Metroid boissssssss
[1:58:59] <oneimportantthing> This was NOT supposed to happen
[1:59:00] <@Menitta> ok it WAS worth it
[1:59:04] <Treasure_Vault> nicecube
[1:59:04] <Gelphaze> These are the best!
[1:59:07] <DoctorMulholland> And here I was thinking "TWO MISSILES AINT WORTH THIS SHIT"
[1:59:07] <%Deft_Thought> Stubborn Will does it again
[1:59:08] <kikoeru_san> wait he broke the sequence, FUCK YEAH
[1:59:09] <$BallerSwagBro9k> SEQUENCE BREKA
[1:59:09] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @NitronStreams
[1:59:15] <OfficerMods> How's the copium non believers?
[1:59:16] <AzaroRequiem> fuck I had no idea you could get this early lmao
[1:59:17] <SunsetJack> And people say it wasn't worth it.
[1:59:18] <+SilverDevilfish> SEQUENCE DEFEATED
[1:59:22] <mar_krow> Sometimes it‚Äôs worth
[1:59:24] <%Artoo__The_Me> That is where we at!
[1:59:25] <oneimportantthing> Woolie I have tears, I'm so proud
[1:59:26] <shotgang86> people said it was impossible
[1:59:26] <+ShinobiPhoenix> this isn't early
[1:59:32] <bazz_tv> lol proove you don't need a skill to get said skill
[1:59:33] <$NitronStreams> IT WAS SO WORTH
[1:59:36] <kikoeru_san> Don't ever stop believing in Woolie
[1:59:36] <wantedsafe471> Area Broken
[1:59:37] <+NeonNobleKalzeria> I mean in about the time it took to get this he'd have probably gotten here normally
[1:59:40] <omnishadeee> yeah normally this needs storm missiles
[1:59:42] <%rindy0> "what's the reward?" "2 missiles and warm fuzzy feelings. AND SPACE JUMP"
[1:59:50] <NiniGiovanini> I'm tottaly doing the same thing next time I play this
[1:59:52] <+scwry> wait howd he sequence break storm
[1:59:52] <@Menitta> lmao that's actually true
[1:59:55] <%Deft_Thought> "Supposed to"
[1:59:56] <+ArcanumArcanum> Not even that much of a sequence break. The very next boss Woolie was going to fight would've given him that 5 shot upgrade
[1:59:59] <+Gorgodrn> @ShinobiPhoenix Yes it was
[2:00:08] <greatspaceadventure> anyone have a clip?? i was looking away since im at work
[2:00:08] <Shwepie> Time to get back on sequence?
[2:00:09] <+ShinobiPhoenix> it is for some people then
[2:00:10] <Blank9> this is at least a 2 item skip, that is so worth it for fun
[2:00:12] <BurdRightsActivist> Did he just bomb jump up there? lol
[2:00:13] <redwidow1358> It's a small skip, but a welcome one
[2:00:14] <+ArcanumArcanum> Hope he goes back to where he was otherwise he's missing a really cool power
[2:00:15] <+thelovingfool> sadly the item is still required
[2:00:18] <%RealThiele> its a small break let him have it
[2:00:20] <shotgang86> the amount of RESPECT I have for darlington right now holy shit
[2:00:21] <emMmDeeKay> If you took that long to skip, is it really a sequence break? LUL
[2:00:24] <redwidow1358> He literally did, for like 20 minutes @burdrightsactivist
[2:00:25] <+ShinobiPhoenix> I tend to forget what counts anymore
[2:00:36] <+ShinobiPhoenix> I did so much weird stuff
[2:00:39] <yuggie_the_shark> no
[2:00:39] <NiniGiovanini> he can skip [REDACTED] if he wants
[2:00:45] <+thelovingfool> Woolie no
[2:00:45] <bobdoletrasher> down
[2:00:46] <oneimportantthing> Woolsworth has made us proud
[2:00:48] <yuggie_the_shark> he ignored the door
[2:00:49] <+Gorgodrn> The map is literally showing the intended sequence. It's not hard to figure out
[2:00:56] <Darren716> Keep going the way you were going
[2:00:59] <+MagiKestral> you'll want to go back and do it normally
[2:00:59] <omnishadeee> maybe go back to normal progress lol
[2:01:06] <$NitronStreams> The world is your oyster
[2:01:09] <Darren716> Normal process has some good shit
[2:01:30] <Carlioo> "HEY ADAM DID YOU SEE THAT SHIT"
[2:01:37] <shotgang86> "Samus, what the fuck"
[2:01:39] <Deasmeister> Yo adam yo see that shit
[2:01:45] <+ShinobiPhoenix> I also did the Missiles from underneath, but I didn't keep going
[2:01:49] <NotHereToStream> "yo samus sick sequence break"
[2:01:49] <+vaderxyz1970> Samus I see you sequence broke the game
[2:01:53] <+thelovingfool> "suck my bird dick adam"
[2:01:54] <Shad0wTag> NO ITS IN RUIN WOOLIE
[2:01:55] <%rindy0> "this place looks like shit"
[2:01:58] <oneimportantthing> Raven Beak is gonna give up out of sheer respect for that grift
[2:01:59] <thackattack00> that just means it was that much sicker in its heyday
[2:01:59] <%RealThiele> chaos
[2:02:01] <KasiCrafter> 50,000 people used to live here. Now it's a ghost town
[2:02:05] <NiniGiovanini> POWERFUL X
[2:02:06] <IntenseNerdRage> "Samus, stop sequence breaking"
[2:02:06] <irisluv333> "that was a sick sequence break, lady"
[2:02:06] <DevinMayCry> "good condition" dude theres evil parasites everywhere and none of the doors are working
[2:02:07] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> "You- you already got the space jump? How did you do that?"
[2:02:17] <$NitronStreams> DAMN YOU RAVEN BEAK
[2:02:18] <greatspaceadventure> i love that this AI has the prosody of real speech but the lack of any tonality just makes it so unsettling
[2:02:20] <Blank9> the doors are working exactly as intended
[2:02:23] <NiniGiovanini> X GONNA
[2:02:27] <dukenux> "Samus, those were very impressive bomb jumps, but i implore you to not sequence break too much"
[2:02:29] <Blank9> chozo society loves to missile blast doors
[2:02:39] <OfficerMods> this happened very VERY recently it seems
[2:02:45] <+ShinobiPhoenix> what ability is about going through Walls and stunning things with electricity
[2:02:54] <+spawnzie> you can melee frozen ennemies to shatter them
[2:02:55] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> "Anor Londo lies in ruins!"
[2:02:58] <emMmDeeKay> "What would a WOMAN know about properly mantaining a home?"
[2:03:00] <DevinMayCry> Just cause chozo metal dont rust doesnt make it a hollow reflection of its former splendor
[2:03:19] <oneimportantthing> Oooh here it comes
[2:03:19] <OfficerMods> @DevinMayCry have you seen zebes?
[2:03:22] <%rindy0> is there a message for sequence breaking/getting somewhere you weren't suppoused to with shinespark? like there was in fusion?
[2:03:26] <shotgang86> this is the slap fight of the century
[2:03:26] <+D00msDayDan> i hate how enemies you can parry in this game also have contact damage
[2:03:40] <DevinMayCry> @OfficerMods SR388 and Talos are more moldy
[2:03:41] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:03:48] <Gelphaze> The X is getting smarter and it has a plan.
[2:03:48] <Jnkolm> "Too bad everything here's already been destroyed" said Samus as she sets another explosive charge
[2:03:52] <%xiccy> he beating your ass
[2:03:55] <+Gorgodrn> You can also Sequence Break the Gravity Suit
[2:03:56] <+ShinobiPhoenix> you can use your Melee offensively obviously
[2:04:01] <redwidow1358> EMMI time
[2:04:06] <+VictorVonLouche> This one sucks i think
[2:04:08] <bobdoletrasher> infinite hearing range btw
[2:04:09] <thackattack00> fuck this one
[2:04:10] <+ShinobiPhoenix> but you have to play around with what chains together
[2:04:12] <OfficerMods> you don't remember how rusted over to literal sand maridia is?
[2:04:14] <KasiCrafter> Time to Space Cheese
[2:04:15] <%rindy0> "this area is ruins, probably from the hundreds of bombs you planted trying to get those missiles"
[2:04:16] <shotgang86> oh this one gave me trouble
[2:04:16] <+MagiKestral> space jump will make this MUCH easier
[2:04:17] <redwidow1358> Infinite hearing range
[2:04:24] <oneimportantthing> This is such a bad section... unless you can space jump
[2:04:31] <Ari_isDrawing> wait I missed it, did woolie give up on his challenge
[2:04:39] <+ShinobiPhoenix> I didn't realize until later that you can Melee with a FLASH SHIFT
[2:04:42] <DevinMayCry> @Ari_isDrawing He got it and space jump doing it

[2:05:27] <NotHereToStream> we 3rd strike bitch
[2:05:28] <+thelovingfool> remember you have a grapple
[2:05:29] <+MagiKestral> someone forgot that the grapple can pull you to blue areas
[2:05:29] <KasiCrafter> We have the Grapple Beam, right? It works underwater, right?
[2:05:30] <redwidow1358> Gottem
[2:05:30] <AzaroRequiem> "WHERE THE FUCK DID SHE GO"
[2:05:32] <+Ropcord> i see he's forgotten about the grapple
[2:05:36] <%rindy0> the animation is slower underwater
[2:05:40] <+ShutUpAceyP> wait how is he making the map bigger?
[2:05:41] <+OroOreo> Claire return your books

[2:06:58] <+thelovingfool> Woolie you have space jump
[2:06:59] <omnishadeee> remember u can grapple
[2:07:00] <dukenux> just haul ass
[2:07:01] <+spawnzie> "whatever I beat your ass in round 1"
[2:07:12] <IceyCone> grapple beam is very useful against this emmi, yeah
[2:07:13] <Blank9> wow, without grapple
[2:07:24] <$NitronStreams> Moisture dangerous
[2:07:25] <mornil314> Use the grapple beam to save time
[2:07:28] <+itslapdog> I was worried the EMMIs would be kind of lame, but they're so good
[2:07:29] <shotgang86> lets FUCKING go
[2:07:34] <oneimportantthing> This is horror

[2:08:34] <$NitronStreams> Hell yeah save after that shit
[2:08:44] <KasiCrafter> @WoolieVersus Are you going to cheese stuff with your sequence broken Space Jump or nah?
[2:08:53] <omnishadeee> the water makes the capture slower
[2:08:59] <%athuramn> she's like "I have some metroid DNA do I?" before she proceeded to absorb all DNA in the area
[2:09:36] <%rindy0> yeyeye, use those 2 missiles
[2:09:43] <OfficerMods> @kasicrafter sequence breaks don't compeltely break the game like it does in super or nestroid
[2:09:52] <OfficerMods> its just a fun thing you can do
[2:09:55] <+D00msDayDan> can't cloak after it's spotted you
[2:10:03] <NiniGiovanini> dababy

[2:11:11] <AngryAsian5> Well now....
[2:11:14] <DoctorMulholland> Holy shit
[2:11:20] <+itslapdog> DREAD
[2:11:21] <+ShutUpAceyP> whats the point of the double jump then lol?
[2:11:21] <omnishadeee> this emmi has infinite hearing range
[2:11:22] <$NitronStreams> Man I would not be able to play this
[2:11:23] <TheHotStuven> What a troll!
[2:11:28] <hassanico2> wait why does Aeion not recover while hanging on a wall?!
[2:11:34] <+Ropcord> monkaS
[2:11:39] <osaka_daioh> NIIIICE
[2:11:41] <hassanico2> oh man
[2:11:43] <redwidow1358> You have to move after it deactivates before it starts @hassanico2
[2:11:45] <+ShutUpAceyP> depends on what ability you use
[2:11:51] <SunsetJack> He can grapple beam during stealth right?
[2:11:52] <+ShutUpAceyP> if you use cloak it recharges once you start moving
[2:11:55] <OfficerMods> imagaine people thinking this is a bad addition to metroid
[2:12:00] <%HollowedIdjit> @hassanico2 Aeion spent for Invis only recovers when you move
[2:12:05] <bear_breaker20> ?

[2:12:22] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> Charge Beam Door: Hello
[2:12:25] <OfficerMods> if only you could fly across the water
[2:12:26] <%ZweihanderSteve> water levels amirite
[2:12:27] <+minibarfs_> you do have something that helps with water movement
[2:12:28] <%LastHazzerd> jerk devs know what theydoin'
[2:12:29] <OfficerMods> as if jumping in space
[2:12:38] <KasiCrafter> I noticed that the second parray happens only AFTER the EMMI's face plate opens
[2:13:00] <+thelovingfool> isn't there a exit right there?
[2:13:14] <+ArcanumArcanum> lol gets through the door, goes back to teh water
[2:13:17] <hassanico2> noice
[2:13:19] <osaka_daioh> Love how intense this is

[2:14:01] <omnishadeee> i mean this emmie in particular
[2:14:23] <hassanico2> WHY DID IT TAKE THE UPPER ROUTE
[2:14:29] <hassanico2> god this guy sucks
[2:14:34] <+VictorVonLouche> stealth is a useful tool
[2:14:35] <oneimportantthing> Lol
[2:14:38] <%athuramn> i found that the sound cue is easier to deal with than trying to parry off the shine
[2:14:40] <TheHotStuven> LMAO
[2:14:42] <+ShutUpAceyP> oh my god
[2:14:42] <$NitronStreams> WOOOOOO

[2:14:58] <+MagiKestral> this section sucks so bad when you forget to use the grapple (like I did)
[2:15:00] <bear_breaker20> hitbox porn
[2:15:01] <+scwry> aw
[2:15:05] <oneimportantthing> Omfg I'm stressing the fuck out

[2:15:17] <redwidow1358> GOTCHA
[2:15:18] <+VictorVonLouche> This one is truely a fucker
[2:15:24] <%fetrigon> greedy
[2:15:25] <Vertigheist> 2 in a row tho p good
[2:15:32] <SunsetJack> Gotta remember grapple beam works on spider walls.
[2:15:42] <+VictorVonLouche> There was an exit right there
[2:15:50] <BlackermanZX> if you cant jump try to grapple to blue walls
[2:15:56] <+thelovingfool> Woolie exit is literally right there
[2:16:05] <OfficerMods> HE DID IT AGAIN
[2:16:09] <hassanico2> ...
[2:16:14] <osaka_daioh> just going in a circle
[2:16:15] <+ArcanumArcanum> lol woolie just running panic loops
[2:16:16] <+ShutUpAceyP> round and round woolie goes
[2:16:20] <%LastHazzerd> water physics
[2:16:21] <reonome> gotta grapple woolz
[2:16:24] <fistynopunches> the panic is real
[2:16:24] <hassanico2> The AI is shortcircuiting
[2:16:25] <+VictorVonLouche> Like there was SEVERAL locations to go there.
[2:16:30] <BudderZilla> MTROID
[2:16:30] <omnishadeee> theres an exit u keep skipping
[2:16:39] <+scwry> and the circles are underwater LUL

[2:17:23] <BudderZilla> Keep rollin-rollin!
[2:17:24] <+thelovingfool> blind

[2:17:26] <+scwry> NICE!
[2:17:26] <%fetrigon> also grappling hook
[2:17:26] <+MagiKestral> might be worth pausing and seeing what's shown up on the map
[2:17:29] <%LastHazzerd> WO
[2:17:29] <+ShutUpAceyP> HE DID IT!
[2:17:31] <OfficerMods> WE OUT WE OUT
[2:17:31] <+ShutUpAceyP> WOOOOOOOO

[2:17:35] <omnishadeee> u kept skipping an easy exit woolie lmao
[2:17:36] <%BisoromiBear> first try
[2:17:39] <KasiCrafter> I think Woolie has legitimately forgot he can use the Grapple Beam underwater

[2:18:25] <Darren716> Oh here we go
[2:18:26] <OfficerMods> emi doors work as checkpoitns
[2:18:26] <hassanico2> The one thing they bring back from Other M and it's ENERGY PARTS bleh

[2:18:49] <+scwry> and theres a boos checkpoint too
[2:18:51] <+scwry> boss
[2:18:54] <+vaporousTippler> Jesus saves. Woolie plays.
[2:18:55] <%rindy0> oh he will like this one
[2:19:05] <+ShinobiPhoenix> this boss is fun....
[2:19:07] <%athuramn> that's a cool effect that the scan goes through the background depth in the environment
[2:19:08] <oneimportantthing> I was taken by fucking surprise here.
[2:19:09] <OfficerMods> @WoolieVersus do chat a favor and RUN into this room
[2:19:10] <Darren716> Shit will this be way easier with space?
[2:19:13] <hassanico2> god those boss/eye doors are so gross
[2:19:15] <+krlos970> Fuck this boss
[2:19:17] <+ShutUpAceyP> prolly
[2:19:20] <+MagiKestral> You can get speed booster in here and use it against this boss to do damage
[2:19:20] <NiniGiovanini> this one is annoying
[2:19:22] <oneimportantthing> This boss is a fuck
[2:19:22] <+ShutUpAceyP> so basic but so painful
[2:19:23] <%rindy0> oh wait nvm it's this one
[2:19:24] <%rindy0> this one sucks
[2:19:27] <+scwry> chat, does this boss have a parry?
[2:19:32] <+ShinobiPhoenix> this boss is SO FUN, IT'S A LOT OF FUN
[2:19:35] <OfficerMods> no it has something way cooler
[2:19:35] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> the fucking homing attack on this guy
[2:19:36] <glass_marcus> This one wrecked my shit on hard mode
[2:19:40] <redwidow1358> This boss has no parry
[2:19:43] <wantedsafe471> the damage
[2:19:48] <valriot> You can kill this boss in like 5s with shenanigans LUL
[2:19:50] <CaptainBright> no parries for this ass of a battle
[2:19:51] <%rindy0> ok fr how do you even dodge the swarm from this guy
[2:19:53] <oneimportantthing> This one pushed my shit in more than the final boss
[2:19:56] <+thelovingfool> you can instant kill in nearly with a shinespark apparently
[2:19:56] <hassanico2> Why electricity blocks damage is beyond me
[2:20:04] <TheHotStuven> This boss HURTS
[2:20:05] <hassanico2> Also goofy boss theme
[2:20:10] <$NitronStreams> oof
[2:20:11] <%fetrigon> doesn't he have space jump
[2:20:13] <Darren716> 1
[2:20:14] <+spawnzie> you can build a shinespark in the hallway
[2:20:15] <NiniGiovanini> tecnically he could have an easier time since he has the space jump
[2:20:18] <OfficerMods> Try running into the room
[2:20:22] <%Prevot> here is the hardest boss in the game IMO
[2:20:25] <oneimportantthing> This boss if fucking awful
[2:20:27] <+MagiKestral> the shinespark isn't that useful
[2:20:33] <+MagiKestral> but it's funny
[2:20:35] <%Prevot> final boss was easier than this shitty bug
[2:20:44] <oneimportantthing> The final boss is actually easier than this bug asshole
[2:20:46] <+thelovingfool> it takes hour a good chunk of health
[2:20:49] <Darren716> Honestly the bug wasn't too bad for me
[2:20:53] <+ArcanumArcanum> @MagiKestral it actually does a shitton of damage. You can hit the boss when he comes in before he electrifies
[2:20:58] <%tank7013> Oh we're on this douchebag now
[2:20:58] <BlackermanZX> space jump can save lives
[2:21:00] <+ArcanumArcanum> Shortens the boss fight significantly
[2:21:04] <%rindy0> how do you dodge the swarm attack from this one?
[2:21:07] <hassanico2> wow everyone hating on bug boy
[2:21:13] <OfficerMods> flash step
[2:21:18] <+ShinobiPhoenix> to be honest, I actually like this boss on a design level
[2:21:22] <omnishadeee> yeah shinespark is like 3/4 of his hp or something mad
[2:21:24] <CaptainBright> Watching Korone against this boss was a CHALLENGE
[2:21:25] <NiniGiovanini> it's not that hard once you figure out a good patern, but it takes a while to get it
[2:21:26] <+thelovingfool> I dodge the swarm by running behind him
[2:21:31] <oneimportantthing> Bug boy SUCKS and the music is almost mocking you
[2:21:34] <+ShinobiPhoenix> but what's with insects having electric attacks in games
[2:21:35] <hassanico2> I mean he sucks compared to near everything but that one glorified X parasite mook
[2:21:36] <%rindy0> the swaem keeps following behind too
[2:21:40] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Oh Boy
[2:21:41] <OfficerMods> well i like how this boss fights but design wise its just a bug
[2:21:43] <Shad0wTag> @CaptainBright how come?
[2:21:44] <+scwry> I like the boss but its a different design philosophy than some of the others
[2:21:45] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Duhmage?
[2:21:47] <%Prevot> final boss took me 3 tries, this one was like 15-20
[2:21:52] <+scwry> HE READ CHAT
[2:21:58] <+MagiKestral> you speed boost into the room, jump along the walls a couple times, then store it
[2:22:00] <omnishadeee> lmao
[2:22:02] <BlackermanZX> DAMN
[2:22:02] <hassanico2> Nice try LUL
[2:22:02] <+spawnzie> DAMN
[2:22:03] <+Tucker0603> lol
[2:22:05] <wantedsafe471> missed
[2:22:06] <oneimportantthing> @prevot Are you me? I had almost exaxtly the same amounts
[2:22:08] <%tank7013> Oh no LUL
[2:22:10] <+thelovingfool> almost
[2:22:11] <+Clarrynet> The purple bullets are really mean
[2:22:11] <+ArcanumArcanum> easy swarm dodge is jump, jump, wall jump. Gets you over all of them
[2:22:16] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Are you tho?
[2:22:20] <+ShinobiPhoenix> are Insects the black superheroes of games.
[2:22:36] <hassanico2> ah he noticed
[2:22:47] <%rindy0> like this boss has VOID attacks, why is it just a bigger charging bug
[2:22:47] <hassanico2> Deflecting the sphere onto the wall reminds me of X4 Sigma
[2:22:52] <%Prevot> everything this thing does is just so fast and hurts so much
[2:22:53] <omnishadeee> he will always lose electrocuted state when he does melee
[2:22:53] <oneimportantthing> Oh wow the space jump helps a ton here
[2:22:54] <Shad0wTag> @ShinobiPhoenix what
[2:22:55] <%rindy0> should have had a cooler design
[2:22:56] <BlackermanZX> download the pattern and hes easy
[2:22:59] <hassanico2> @0rond because X parasites shut up
[2:23:00] <+ShinobiPhoenix> the blackhole bomb that shocks the ground is tight
[2:23:11] <OfficerMods> too late
[2:23:15] <oneimportantthing> Use morph bombs LUL LUL
[2:23:16] <omnishadeee> yeah u gotta be fast
[2:23:19] <+spawnzie> Gotta be quicker
[2:23:21] <wantedsafe471> blocked
[2:23:22] <%rindy0> @hassanico2 I mean sure it makes sense in lore but it should have a cooler design
[2:23:25] <+thelovingfool> it's tight
[2:23:26] <+scwry> predictobo
[2:23:28] <+ShinobiPhoenix> insects constantly get electric powers in games and anime
[2:23:36] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Tatakae woolie
[2:23:43] <+ShinobiPhoenix> black superheroes constantly have electric based powers
[2:23:45] <hassanico2> @0rond X parasite design is usually just "Bigger, uglier, spikier version of thing"
[2:23:46] <%Prevot> I think this boss is what made me really good at quick free aiming
[2:23:48] <+Tucker0603> gotta be the fastest pew in the west on that shinespark
[2:23:59] <Shad0wTag> @ShinobiPhoenix I mean okay but what weird analogy
[2:24:01] <%rindy0> this shouldn't have been an X parasite boss though imo
[2:24:10] <oneimportantthing> This fucking bug is the hardest boss in the game
[2:24:19] <OfficerMods> you can try to get him round start or keep your meter going
[2:24:21] <@Menitta> Jeez that's a lot of damage
[2:24:21] <bobdoletrasher> it is
[2:24:21] <$NitronStreams> Why is some random bug such a badass?
[2:24:25] <+ShinobiPhoenix> it's not weird, people just don't see things broadly
[2:24:27] <hassanico2> I mean yeah it FEELS like something unique should be here instead of a reused design but X'd
[2:24:30] <+thelovingfool> I mean it literally has to at this point in the game
[2:24:30] <oneimportantthing> No parry, and VERY small dodge window
[2:24:31] <+TitaniumDragoonNeo> I wonder if you can counter his diving charge attack.
[2:24:31] <%rindy0> 2late
[2:24:34] <+spawnzie> too late
[2:24:37] <BlackermanZX> damn so close
[2:24:41] <fairore> yall had trouble with this boss?
[2:24:47] <Vertigheist> @ShinobiPhoenix what about raiden
[2:24:51] <+thelovingfool> has to be way faster
[2:24:51] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:24:51] <+twohitgood> wonder if you could parry that dash attack?
[2:24:58] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Sigma Insect:Ignore game mechanics
[2:25:00] <Warbot40> problem with this boss design is that it's just an existing enemy with a slight palette change. Feels like a mini boss rather than a proper boss based on that alone.
[2:25:01] <+thelovingfool> you cant
[2:25:02] <+scwry> took me about 4 times iirc
[2:25:03] <+MagiKestral> you can parry the dash attack on the normal bugs, not this one
[2:25:03] <OfficerMods> oh yeah i had trouble with this one but he was good practice for chad
[2:25:06] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Anihilate players
[2:25:08] <CaptainBright> @twohitgood No you can't
[2:25:13] <%Prevot> random bug somehow a bigger baddas than Raven Beak
[2:25:15] <„Éè„ÇØ„Ç¢> remember sigma in mmx4
[2:25:16] <Warbot40> I wonder if they had to cut corners on this design
[2:25:35] <BlackermanZX> you almost got the patttern down
[2:25:37] <+ShinobiPhoenix> @vertigheist since when is Raiden black or a superhero
[2:25:43] <oneimportantthing> This bug has no right being as hard as it is
[2:25:49] <+Tucker0603> QuickDraw that shinespark
[2:25:49] <glass_marcus> stay in the corner
[2:25:54] <Vertigheist> @ShinobiPhoenix no he just uses electricity
[2:25:56] <+Tucker0603> be FAST
[2:25:58] <+scwry> pop it earlier
[2:26:03] <hassanico2> you know I only just looked at the background
[2:26:03] <+minibarfs_> you have to hit him before he gets electrified
[2:26:06] <+spawnzie> gotta pre fire
[2:26:07] <+thelovingfool> @woolieversus it has to be before he electrifies
[2:26:08] <hassanico2> With all the statues
[2:26:13] <oneimportantthing> Keep the bug on one end, stay in the other to have dodging room
[2:26:16] <%rindy0> "samus, at your current state you would have no chance against raven beak, try to lead him to the giga chad electric bug, it should be able to beat him easily"
[2:26:16] <KasiCrafter> Looks like you have to use the shinespark BEFORE he gets on stage
[2:26:20] <BlackermanZX> remember shinespark has some startup
[2:26:20] <%Prevot> you know this totally reminds me of the shitty Prime 2 bug boss that was also way too hard
[2:26:37] <OfficerMods> i love prime 2 and i totally forgot that boss
[2:26:39] <hassanico2> chat what instrument is making these stupid noises in the music
[2:26:42] <+ShinobiPhoenix> @vertigheist please don't do that. it's black superheroes often have electric powers, not electric based heroes are always black
[2:26:43] <bobdoletrasher> harder than the final boss
[2:26:46] <hassanico2> You know the ones trying to sound "scary"
[2:27:06] <hassanico2> Like, is that a violin?
[2:27:06] <+ShutUpAceyP> NICE
[2:27:08] <hassanico2> Also, GG
[2:27:09] <omnishadeee> u have to shinespark way early to catch him before he armours up
[2:27:09] <fairore> @bobdoletrasher cap
[2:27:11] <+scwry> :)
[2:27:14] <%Prevot> LUL
[2:27:16] <hassanico2> Core X bois
[2:27:18] <+sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[2:27:19] <Darren716> It's dat boi
[2:27:19] <Vertigheist> @ShinobiPhoenix I mean, I'm just saying electric powers are cool
[2:27:20] <%Prevot> long time no see
[2:27:24] <+scwry> GG
[2:27:24] <%RealThiele> X-Ball
[2:27:25] <%Deft_Thought> It's a lot nastier looking
[2:27:26] <+ShinobiPhoenix> there's literally articles and papers written about the culture of why that is in media
[2:27:27] <+HakureiIllusion> You can charge-shot the Core-X this time
[2:27:27] <Darren716> Legit I died to the x core once
[2:27:27] <hassanico2> COOLEST MOVE
[2:27:29] <wantedsafe471> close shave
[2:27:29] <kikoeru_san> oh damn
[2:27:30] <+spawnzie> jello dispenser
[2:27:32] <BlackermanZX> YEYEYE STORM MISSILE
[2:27:32] <Darren716> yeyeyee
[2:27:32] <+D00msDayDan> time for RAD SHIT
[2:27:33] <pixelkingu> yeyeyey we do it
[2:27:34] <%Prevot> some of these were hard in Fusion
[2:27:35] <%Deft_Thought> Hoho, storm missile you say
[2:27:37] <+sonofthedeepsouth> YEAH
[2:27:37] <Darren716> Coolest weapon
[2:27:38] <+Tucker0603> STORM MISSILE SOUNDS RAD
[2:27:38] <oneimportantthing> Have no idea why they designed something with such a hard moveset a BUG
[2:27:38] <%rindy0> THIS UPGRADE IS INSANE
[2:27:40] <NiniGiovanini> YOU DID IT
[2:27:41] <+minibarfs_> The Fusion fanservice in this game is STRONG
[2:27:42] <Blank9> best missile
[2:27:46] <$NitronStreams> STORM MISSILES ARE APPROACHING
[2:27:46] <+MagiKestral> Prime 2 is CANON
[2:27:48] <jorniev> GOOD TONE GOOD TONE
[2:27:48] <+Lobo_V1> I bought a Switch today, was thinking on buying also this game, but I saw it was a 7 hours game to complete the story, I bought Fire Emblem instead, still it looks really good so probably I'll buy it with my next paycheck koefKoeggers
[2:27:50] <+ShinobiPhoenix> so not quite a sequence break, like said
[2:27:50] <hassanico2> @Prevot the beam ones always shot back at you on hit
[2:27:50] <+scwry> this is for the space jump lol
[2:27:52] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> Seeker Missiles... 2!
[2:27:53] <%rindy0> this shit SLAYS bosses
[2:27:55] <hassanico2> Those were the ones that sucked
[2:27:55] <wantedsafe471> IT ZUBAZS FAVORITE MISSILES
[2:27:56] <oneimportantthing> This shit rocks
[2:27:58] <bobdoletrasher> best weapon
[2:27:58] <%Deft_Thought> @WoolieVersus Hey, now you can go get that Space Jump LUL
[2:27:59] <pixelkingu> aaand you get the best weapon in the game
[2:28:02] <OfficerMods> tape down the right bumper
[2:28:10] <hassanico2> @0rond actually a full barrage of Storm missiles does less damage than a regular missile
[2:28:10] <BlackermanZX> Storm missiles does some chunky damage
[2:28:13] <+ShinobiPhoenix> considering Storm and Space Jump are literally a few rooms from each other
[2:28:13] <%fetrigon> yoooooooo
[2:28:16] <omnishadeee> they are micromissiles btw, deal less damage than regular missiles
[2:28:16] <%HollowedIdjit> ya like macross?
[2:28:17] <+scwry> I cant imagine this being skippable in speedruns
[2:28:21] <+scwry> its too good
[2:28:22] <TheHotStuven> This ability is dope af
[2:28:26] <+spawnzie> and that's why you get a shitload of missiles
[2:28:27] <marumariball> metroid prime 2
[2:28:30] <$NitronStreams> You got the Sakuga Missiles
[2:28:31] <Blank9> so much better than a charge shot
[2:28:35] <%Prevot> this is a prime powerup reworked
[2:28:39] <%Deft_Thought> Samus is terrifying
[2:28:41] <OfficerMods> @omnishadeee no one guy they do the same damage as ice missiles per missle
[2:28:42] <+ShinobiPhoenix> @omnishadeee not when you use 5 of them
[2:28:46] <hassanico2> No this is an Other M powerup reworked Kappa
[2:28:46] <iamnotaparrot> @lobo_v1 woolie is like 10 hours in and had many bosses to go
[2:28:46] <%rindy0> @hassanico2 maybe 1 but bosses let you do like 3-5 lock ons
[2:28:48] <+ShutUpAceyP> seeker missle 2. electric boogalo
[2:28:50] <+Tucker0603> I fucking love micro missiles
[2:28:54] <%rindy0> it also let's you aim a lot more easily
[2:28:59] <hassanico2> It was in Other M you got this move too and it was NEVER useufl LUL
[2:29:01] <%tank7013> And this is why they start you with 15 missiles. So you can beat 0% runs
[2:29:07] <+Ropcord> and then she trips on a rock and loses all of them
[2:29:08] <omnishadeee> @OfficerMods for final boss at least theyre not worth. 3 missiles is 450 damage vs 1 uncharged for 400
[2:29:12] <%Deft_Thought> She can generate enough force to run through somebody
[2:29:13] <emMmDeeKay> Samus could mop the floor with Master Chief
[2:29:20] <wantedsafe471> yeah, if Samus had a access to all her abilitys,. she would be unstoppable
[2:29:22] <emMmDeeKay> It's her kid after all
[2:29:30] <+ShinobiPhoenix> 15 micromissiles that lock on and let you dodge is way better than aiming 5 really slow Ice Missiles
[2:29:38] <%Prevot> by the end of this game Samus is fucking invincible
[2:29:51] <%Prevot> like she's waaaaay overpowered
[2:29:58] <iamnotaparrot> samus would shinespark into master chief and turn him into a cloud of red mist
[2:30:00] <+ShinobiPhoenix> you will BELIEVE in Storm Missiles for bosses later
[2:30:35] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> ANOR LONDA IN RUINS
[2:30:35] <OfficerMods> Its recently ruined
[2:30:35] <%rindy0> YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN IT WHEN IT WAS NEW
[2:30:39] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> *londo
[2:30:40] <$NitronStreams> THE DUST THO
[2:30:41] <Shad0wTag> NO WOOLIE
[2:30:42] <+spawnzie> DESTROYED
[2:30:42] <wantedsafe471> then I'm the next game, she gets her ass handed to her by a bug and loses all her powers
[2:30:44] <+hax_metatron> The original was fucked
[2:30:44] <%kyh9> This game just feels so fucking good tho
[2:30:44] <+eanscrale> Internals might be nonfunctioning
[2:30:45] <%Prevot> 97% of the smash rosters shouldn't even stand a chance against Samus after Dread
[2:30:48] <Shad0wTag> ADAM SAID ITS RUINED
[2:30:48] <AdrianBauer> it's ruined after samus gets through with it
[2:30:49] <wantedsafe471> in, woops
[2:30:53] <emMmDeeKay> "What does a WOMAN know about Ruins, the Men are talking Lady" - Adam
[2:30:53] <%BisoromiBear> shoes are creased
[2:30:59] <+ShinobiPhoenix> I was dodging bosses and HOLDING that R button ready to aim my lock ons
[2:31:02] <omnishadeee> @ShinobiPhoenix yeah but the issue is in longer fights when they burn through ur ammo. ur trading damage for speed and when u dont kill the guy fast enough it becomes an issue
[2:31:14] <%jinking79> no one is cleaning it so it's ruin
[2:31:19] <emMmDeeKay> it would be a WIPEOUT
[2:31:24] <NotHereToStream> samus with phase shift
[2:31:25] <bobdoletrasher> yea
[2:31:25] <+ShinobiPhoenix> your ammo. your ammo that is refilled like candy?!
[2:31:26] <marumariball> phase shift would be so broke
[2:31:27] <$BallerSwagBro9k> BOARD WIPE
[2:31:31] <hassanico2> God Smash Samus' missiles are depressing
[2:31:35] <TheHotStuven> I just love the name Storm Missile
[2:31:35] <kikoeru_san> the rating would jump to M just with how badass she is
[2:31:36] <DontChuckle98> The parry would just be a counter
[2:31:37] <BlackermanZX> honestly they could just add this version as a new character
[2:31:40] <Shad0wTag> I think we should have two Samus's. OG Samus and Fusion/Dread Samus
[2:31:46] <BlackermanZX> like link and young link
[2:31:48] <%LastHazzerd> there's some very Key differences between pre and post MetroiDNA Samus
[2:31:49] <+ShinobiPhoenix> I was definitely doing dodges and Storms great
[2:31:52] <%tank7013> Imagine her down b is a functioning melee counter
[2:31:52] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:31:53] <omnishadeee> @ShinobiPhoenix in overworld its fine but in long boss fights when ur ammo is not being refilled like candy
[2:31:54] <emMmDeeKay> Samus is the kind of person you send to deal with Super Saiyans
[2:31:55] <OfficerMods> remember in nestroid when missiles were literally only used for doors and mother brain?
[2:31:56] <+Tucker0603> how many Emmis has he killed
[2:31:56] <%kyh9> I hope the next Smash game actually offers more of each character‚Äôs in-game progression as a mechanic
[2:32:10] <Shad0wTag> Tell me chat is my suggestion crazy?
[2:32:18] <%Savatewolf> OG Samus can just be SA-X
[2:32:19] <%Prevot> whenever new smash gets made we need this Samus AND Raven Beak as characters
[2:32:22] <+Ropcord> raven beak for next smash pls
[2:32:26] <@Menitta> Metroid Generations
[2:32:35] <emMmDeeKay> Raven Beak for Smash Kerfuffle
[2:32:39] <+ShinobiPhoenix> you know you can destroy boss projectiles for ammo even IF you ran out which I didn't
[2:32:42] <+Ropcord> Also Dark Samus should have been a Lucario clone but that is neither here nor there
[2:32:42] <+thecowpow> RUINED
[2:32:50] <DontChuckle98> I can go for a Hyrule Warriors type of ordeal but with the Smash characters instead of just Zelda
[2:32:51] <kikoeru_san> more Metroid characters in Smash in general tbh
[2:33:01] <+ShinobiPhoenix> it's a non-issue
[2:33:02] <OfficerMods> raven beak can be put into ****** pretty easily with some small adjustments to existing sprites
[2:33:14] <%Prevot> fuck I'd take SA-X as an ego fighter over Dark Samus
[2:33:22] <%Prevot> *echo
[2:33:25] <omnishadeee> @ShinobiPhoenix yeah but a certain boss fight doesnt have many of those and has a ton of health
[2:33:34] <%rindy0> SA-X would be the same with a different final smash
[2:33:38] <+thecowpow> Dark Samus is a good pick but making her a clone of Samus was not
[2:33:39] <%rindy0> dark samus is cooler
[2:33:48] <%RealThiele> SA-X just goes all goop form and infects everyone
[2:33:49] <+ShutUpAceyP> @Prevot i just wish they would give dark samus some new moves. thats it.
[2:33:57] <%Prevot> nah SA-X can have Venom esque moves
[2:33:59] <+ShinobiPhoenix> @omnishadeee. I MORE THAN DOUBT that I will have a problem at this point I am
[2:34:01] <+TheyCallMeVawn> Whens Captain Falcon showing up in Metroid tho
[2:34:04] <redwidow1358> If Dark Samus had like two new moves I'd be happy
[2:34:08] <wantedsafe471> Yeah, dark Samus should of had her own moves
[2:34:10] <iamnotaparrot> who on the smash cast can even beat samus? like sephiroth is a RPG final boss God and his final smash is blowing up planets. something samus does biweekly at this point
[2:34:15] <%rindy0> in game SA-X doesn't do anything different than samus except for the final boss sequance
[2:34:21] <%rindy0> they would have to make it from scratch
[2:34:25] <OfficerMods> dark samus really doesn't have a unique kit out side of...clone jutsu? Giant energy balls? Flight?
[2:34:29] <+ShinobiPhoenix> negative doubts level
[2:34:34] <kikoeru_san> YEAH PARRY
[2:34:38] <+ShutUpAceyP> how long did it take everyone to beat the game and what percentages did you have?
[2:34:39] <+thelovingfool> you have space jump
[2:34:48] <+thelovingfool> there we go
[2:34:56] <+ShinobiPhoenix> people need to stop caring about time to beat a game
[2:35:01] <NotHereToStream> get juked son
[2:35:03] <%rindy0> AAWH THE JUKKES
[2:35:05] <R_Blaze> nice dodge
[2:35:07] <%rindy0> SO GOOD
[2:35:08] <TheHotStuven> Damn LOL
[2:35:10] <+ShinobiPhoenix> just play the game at your pace and get done what you want
[2:35:10] <+chadwicktouchdown> schmovin
[2:35:15] <omnishadeee> @ShinobiPhoenix if u scour the map for tons of missiles sure u would be ok but they literally do not do much more damage for the missile cost. i dont make the damage numbers they are what they are
[2:35:16] <+scwry> 10 hours, 100%
[2:35:17] <wantedsafe471> Can emmis fly yet?
[2:35:17] <+NeonNobleKalzeria> well you were supposed to get space jump
[2:35:20] <essence_of_lariatto> there's path north left you haven't taken
[2:35:20] <OfficerMods> @ShinobiPhoenixchat REALLY wants woolie to see the end
[2:35:24] <+Slattsquatch> @ShutUpAceyP 100% item completion on my first run, I think it was like 8:25 in game time
[2:35:25] <AsinPersuasion> schmovin
[2:35:26] <%tank7013> @iamnotaparrot Seph and Cloud would definitely give Samus a fight. They're both also super soldiers with alien DNA
[2:35:31] <+ShinobiPhoenix> I only care about 100% but I don't care how long
[2:35:38] <+Slattsquatch> Which is more like 11 in hours real time
[2:35:42] <%Prevot> mine was like 100% 9:50
[2:35:48] <%neraren> Quest to defeat Raven Beak, or, To Kill a Mawkin Bird
[2:35:49] <%rindy0> #notworth
[2:35:50] <+picante_papi> atpRtsd
[2:35:51] <+ShinobiPhoenix> I am literally just scrapping for whatever items I am missing
[2:35:52] <iamnotaparrot> I did 100% within 11 hours, but my ocd made me fill in every map pixel when I entered a room
[2:35:56] <essence_of_lariatto> but can cloud survive a power bomb
[2:35:57] <+ShutUpAceyP> i beat it in 6 hours with 34% items lol
[2:35:58] <%rindy0> at least you killed that tiny robot eh?
[2:35:59] <+thelovingfool> I did a 4 hour run last night, really fun
[2:35:59] <%Deft_Thought> Just had to punch a robot
[2:36:11] <+MagiKestral> 8 hours for 100%, but I speedran Hard for 3:55
[2:36:14] <+Neoepochx> low 9 hrs with 100%
[2:36:15] <TheHotStuven> Took me like 9:57 to 100% and beat the game
[2:36:18] <+ShinobiPhoenix> once I am done with Dread, I can move on to the next game
[2:36:22] <OfficerMods> sub 4 aint bad
[2:36:22] <omnishadeee> the ingame timer resets on deaths
[2:36:29] <OfficerMods> is that game time or real time?
[2:36:32] <Shwepie> @iamnotaparrot Same on %, time, and map ocd.
[2:36:36] <+TheyCallMeVawn> Woolie you have space jump
[2:36:38] <TioXyco> nice parry
[2:36:39] <+thelovingfool> in game
[2:36:44] <AsinPersuasion> C O U N T E R
[2:36:44] <OfficerMods> still not bad
[2:36:45] <+ShinobiPhoenix> I am not the type of person that needs to play a game Again immediately but different, I have other things to play
[2:36:54] <OfficerMods> the speed run times are getting lower and lower every day though
[2:36:56] <OfficerMods> its getting absurd
[2:37:01] <%Deft_Thought> Parry being easier underwater makes that robot less wild
[2:37:01] <+scwry> I cant wait to replay this game
[2:37:01] <%kyh9> The parries
[2:37:02] <thackattack00> damn it took me like 13.5 hours to 100%. only 4.5 playing again on hard tho
[2:37:14] <+Dr_DangerPhD> @OfficerMods yeah, that's why it's called a speed run
[2:37:14] <%kyh9> The EMMI fears the frame perfect fighting game player
[2:37:17] <%tank7013> The biggest asshole thing about purple is that it can see through walls
[2:37:18] <%Dr00_PhD> It took me 15 for 100% but i also filled in every square of the map
[2:37:19] <Helix_Snake> I hate the fucking ahhh!! real monsters crabs
[2:37:20] <+ShinobiPhoenix> hell, I have my own games to work on let other people's games to play
[2:37:27] <Helix_Snake> they're so hard to parry
[2:37:33] <+thelovingfool> sub 4 is for some of the end rewards, timer pauses in map screen thank god
[2:37:34] <iamnotaparrot> I feel like samus vs. cloud is in samu's favor, but every second that passes gives it more to cloud.
[2:37:42] <DoctorMulholland> Yeah those leggy things are bastards
[2:37:43] <%Deft_Thought> OH
[2:37:44] <OfficerMods> @Dr_DangerPhD It's also why its call a Miya
[2:37:45] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> THE BOYS
[2:37:45] <wantedsafe471> How on earth does the federation get anything done without Samus's help?
[2:37:48] <+VictorVonLouche> Time to get wrecked
[2:37:49] <jorniev> OH SHIT
[2:37:49] <BlackermanZX> oh fuck this fight
[2:37:49] <+spawnzie> TWO
[2:37:54] <oneimportantthing> Tee hee
[2:37:54] <%rindy0> this one's a bit of a bitch but at least they are cool
[2:37:56] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> This is more fun than Smash lol
[2:37:56] <+LazyAss24Seven> LES GOOO
[2:37:58] <OldManDeckardCain> it does look like a smash stage LUL
[2:37:59] <%fetrigon> yo
[2:38:00] <+ShinobiPhoenix> Dread is the first time in a while that I played a game to enjoy it rather than just STUDY in for game development stuff
[2:38:00] <%rindy0> easier with storm missiles
[2:38:01] <+HakureiIllusion> Storm Missiles for days
[2:38:04] <+thelovingfool> fuck this fight in hard mode
[2:38:10] <%RealThiele> the quick for these 2 is laughable fast
[2:38:12] <+ShutUpAceyP> storm missiles
[2:38:13] <Helix_Snake> this is the best fight in the game imo
[2:38:17] <oneimportantthing> Woolie use your powers
[2:38:17] <+VictorVonLouche> Gotta get good at parries
[2:38:18] <%RealThiele> quick kill*
[2:38:18] <Helix_Snake> I love how hard it is
[2:38:21] <%fetrigon> red oni blue oni
[2:38:24] <+scwry> FYI you can move and charge storm missiles
[2:38:28] <omnishadeee> i wish these dudes had a better theme
[2:38:28] <%tank7013> @wantedsafe471 I don't think there's a single instance of them doing anything properly in the entire series LUL
[2:38:30] <+Slattsquatch> Agni & Rudra
[2:38:34] <jorniev> good call
[2:38:36] <BlackermanZX> you can move and charge right?
[2:38:40] <NotHereToStream> would of been cool if they could hit each other
[2:38:40] <%rindy0> I hated this fight, but I also forgot I just got storm missiles so that probably would have made it easier lmao
[2:38:40] <jorniev> totally agni and rudra
[2:38:42] <+ShinobiPhoenix> you can hold the R button at any point
[2:38:42] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> You can charge them while running too
[2:38:50] <+scwry> you you can hold down R and keep moving
[2:38:54] <+ShinobiPhoenix> and then aim LATER
[2:38:54] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:38:56] <%Prevot> nice
[2:38:57] <+MagiKestral> you don't need to hold down L while holding down R
[2:38:58] <Blank9> so much damage
[2:39:00] <+kewlmyc> PRO
[2:39:00] <+LazyAss24Seven> yeeeeeeee
[2:39:02] <+AngriestAngryArtist> first try!
[2:39:08] <oneimportantthing> Niiice
[2:39:11] <%HollowedIdjit> @shutupaceyp it took me between 9 and 10 hours for 100%
[2:39:12] <iamnotaparrot> you can charge storm missiles while jumping around
[2:39:17] <wantedsafe471> is this the O&S of Metroid dread
[2:39:23] <Helix_Snake> there has to be a mechanic where you do damage faster if you don't take damage right
[2:39:33] <Helix_Snake> with the speed I've seen some of these bosses get taken down
[2:39:34] <+AngriestAngryArtist> storm missles makes quick work lol
[2:39:55] <+ArcanumArcanum> So does chat just not know that woolie doesn't read chat? So many people trying to give him advice he will never read
[2:40:02] <omnishadeee> @Helix_Snake nothing like that but u can mash the beam crazy fast for high dps
[2:40:11] <reonome> @ArcanumArcanum he reads it occasionally
[2:40:12] <%rindy0> he does read it occasionally
[2:40:16] <iamnotaparrot> @arcanumarcanum he does though.
[2:40:16] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> Sometimes he does
[2:40:17] <AsinPersuasion> people like screaming into the void
[2:40:26] <+Atomic_ColliderSG> The bosses are so cool in this game they all just die way too fast though
[2:40:31] <%Prevot> man look at how cool and tough these chozo warriors and robots are, how the fuck did space pirates kick their ass
[2:40:37] <+HakureiIllusion> He's literally read many chat messages including some of mine out loud on stream, so... yeah, he does read
[2:40:37] <+Rekinsinn> @Helix_Snake one part of it is that single missiles, after having all upgrades, is better dps than the storm missiles
[2:40:42] <omnishadeee> congrats on space jump!
[2:40:55] <+Atomic_ColliderSG> Parry is just too good
[2:40:55] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> @Prevot They killed the pacifist loser Chozo
[2:41:07] <%Prevot> damn
[2:41:16] <iamnotaparrot> space pirates beat up the thoha on zebes. the peaceful tribe. these guys are mawkin, the warrior tribe
[2:41:17] <%Prevot> zebes was the nerd planet
[2:41:25] <+ShinobiPhoenix> @prevot they didn't. the Chozo hurt themselves in civil war and left the galaxy, like the Gallifreyana
[2:41:28] <Helix_Snake> @Helix_Snake for real, hmm
[2:41:31] <+thelovingfool> it's easy to forget you can scan
[2:41:45] <iamnotaparrot> also I'm not sure I'd the zero mission Manga is still Canon.
[2:41:54] <Helix_Snake> @iamnotaparrot I believe it is not
[2:41:58] <%HollowedIdjit> @prevot the Chozo, or at least the peaceful ones, literally rewrote their Genetic Code so that violent actions would cause them intense pain because they didn't want to turn into a race of Conquerors
[2:42:03] <omnishadeee> @Prevot they do actually explain that a bit in the manga, the pirates "somehow" get a miniblack hole generator
[2:42:07] <wantedsafe471> wasn't 90% of their race by that point pacifists?
[2:42:11] <+ShinobiPhoenix> Chozo are like Vulcans and Reman and Romulans
[2:42:29] <iamnotaparrot> they also lost the ability to have offspring and all were elderly
[2:42:41] <iamnotaparrot> so they're functionally extinct before even metrpid 1
[2:42:46] <+thelovingfool> chozo gilfs
[2:42:50] <+ShinobiPhoenix> Samus is like the last Chozo that can fuck
[2:43:00] <iamnotaparrot> can she?
[2:43:09] <+Neoepochx> why not?
[2:43:09] <+ShinobiPhoenix> she chooses not to
[2:43:13] <%HollowedIdjit> Samus is prolly ace
[2:43:16] <+OroOreo> I‚Äôll give it a shot
[2:43:24] <+thelovingfool> daddy issues
[2:43:27] <%athuramn> too much Adam on her mind
[2:43:32] <%rindy0> samus goes to bars and stuff, it's not unreasonable to believe she fucks
[2:43:43] <+ShinobiPhoenix> Samus probably isn't Ace, but doesn't care to tie down to anything that would hurt her ability to shoot you
[2:43:59] <%Prevot> she probably scares all potential partners away by doing morph ball in bed
[2:44:04] <Treasure_Vault> The only bar Samus goes to is Tomboy Hooters
[2:44:04] <+thelovingfool> she's all business no play
[2:44:16] <+ShinobiPhoenix> Samus is definitely on the lookout for betrayal and definitely has trust issues
[2:44:23] <wantedsafe471> the absolute abomination of a child, 1/3 human 1/3 chozo 1/3 metroid
[2:44:27] <+Tucker0603> wait Samus is a chozo?
[2:44:30] <%HollowedIdjit> The only thing Samus lets into her life are spheres and cute animals
[2:44:41] <+ShinobiPhoenix> @tucker0603 has been since BEFORE Metroid
[2:44:41] <+thelovingfool> yes
[2:44:44] <+mister___doctor> Samus is not shown to have any kind of social life at all so just leave it to your imagination
[2:44:45] <%Prevot> oh god
[2:44:46] <%GeneralSCPatton> Samus can guve that good life-ending SUCC nikkib12Lewd
[2:44:51] <iamnotaparrot> "bro I went out with this 6'3" chick on tinder and she told me she's part bird then turned into a ball"
[2:44:52] <%Prevot> is samus a bird furry
[2:44:53] <BlackermanZX> samus stays in power suit during sex
[2:44:56] <+thelovingfool> she's human, chozo, and metroid
[2:44:58] <%athuramn> she goes on dates but when she hears "ladies and gentlemen" she spirals hard
[2:45:00] <+HakureiIllusion> Do not have sex with Samus, Metroid DNA means she don't stop succing until you're dead
[2:45:02] <Treasure_Vault> @BlackermanZX good
[2:45:08] <%tank7013> @Tucker0603 The chozo infused her with their dna after they adopted her to make her strong
[2:45:12] <shaddydaddyo> @HakureiIllusion good
[2:45:18] <%Deft_Thought> She's a GENETIC FREAK
[2:45:22] <%HollowedIdjit> @blackermanzx is that supposed to be a downside?
[2:45:26] <Shad0wTag> YOU WILL BE PART BIRD PERSON
[2:45:27] <iamnotaparrot> someone holds a door for her and says "ladies first" and her mouth starts frothing
[2:45:31] <Shad0wTag> whether you like it or not
[2:45:38] <+ShinobiPhoenix> @tucker0603 When Samus's colony was destroyed due to their impact, they took her in and altered her to survive on their planet
[2:46:03] <+PhantomMiG> chozo homeworld is hardcore enough that non-chozo generally die
[2:46:03] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1447814216103104512?t=FMN9Zf2S4JsthZvBIlfXDQ&s=19
[2:46:08] <+ShinobiPhoenix> so she's been half Chozo since Age of 3
[2:46:10] <+ShutUpAceyP> hey grappled!
[2:46:16] <+ShinobiPhoenix> though more likely 4
[2:46:16] <TheHotStuven> LUL
[2:46:21] <+Tucker0603> huh....never knew
[2:46:22] <iamnotaparrot> she's probably got a cloaca
[2:46:24] <sauceboss310> sugoiAwawa sugoiAwawa
[2:46:28] <%rindy0> god when you lay out her backstory she sounds like an edgy OC
[2:46:31] <%fetrigon> ayyy he got it
[2:46:33] <+ShinobiPhoenix> that's why Chozo tech responds to her
[2:46:34] <omnishadeee> dont forget grapple
[2:46:38] <DoctorMulholland> Those little drones that pop up sure are bastards
[2:46:44] <+ShinobiPhoenix> she IS Chozo
[2:47:01] <%tank7013> @Tucker0603 Yea. And with metroid dna from Fusion and a moderate connection to the x parasites she's kind of a walking petri dish
[2:47:01] <+gridib> PogChamp
[2:47:02] <ElPlasa> OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[2:47:09] <+ShinobiPhoenix> Space Pirates still can't clone Ball tech
[2:47:11] <+thelovingfool> wait did he miss the door again
[2:47:15] <+AngriestAngryArtist> smoooth
[2:47:15] <brachydios777> Nice
[2:47:17] <BurdRightsActivist> NICEE
[2:47:19] <+Tucker0603> so Samus is birb up
[2:47:21] <+ShinobiPhoenix> not thag the space Pirates exists anymore
[2:47:22] <Tnecniv_DG> Loving these smooth Emmi counters
[2:47:26] <+Neoepochx> "Let me just Mosey on out of here."
[2:47:31] <+gridib> That purple EMMI is so annoying tbh
[2:47:38] <+AngriestAngryArtist> fighting game just frame training comes in handy lol
[2:47:45] <%Prevot> don't know if it's just me but I felt like underwater partying was easier, I got a bunch on purple EMMI too
[2:47:57] <+ShinobiPhoenix> even if there are members of the various races left, Ridley is super dust so they scattered
[2:48:01] <+Neoepochx> Underwater parrying is easier
[2:48:08] <+PhantomMiG> Samus was raised by two bird dads one give her the dna for the dna splice
[2:48:12] <+Neoepochx> there are like a few extra frames

[2:48:13] <%Deft_Thought> You know they say all Chozo are created equal, but you look at me and you look at Raven Beak and you can see that statement is NOT TRUE! See, normally if you go one-on-one with another Mawkin you got a fifty/fifty chance of winning. But I'm a genetic freak, and I'm not normal!
[2:48:28] <+Neoepochx> LOL
[2:48:39] <brachydios777> Federation would of not needed Samus for Mother Brain if they had these EMMIs way back then
[2:48:43] <ElPlasa> @Deft_Thought BRUH LUL
[2:48:47] <%rindy0> is it ever explained why tf kraid is on this planet?
[2:48:48] <iamnotaparrot> you see KFC's Twitter just shat on back 4 blood for no reason?
[2:48:50] <+ShinobiPhoenix> in any case, Samus is part BIRD and part JELLYFISH
[2:48:53] <%HollowedIdjit> rest in peace Gray Voice, you were rad
[2:48:54] <OldManDeckardCain> samus IS a genetic freak after all...4
[2:48:54] <%tank7013> @PhantomMiG According to this game she probably has DNA from at least two different tribes actually
[2:49:18] <%Prevot> I mean the EMMI got hacked here, Mother brain could probably hack them too
[2:49:29] <TheHotStuven> she has Thoha and Mawkin tribe DNA
[2:49:34] <brachydios777> @tank7013 SHHH
[2:49:34] <%HollowedIdjit> Mother Brain totally could have hacked them
[2:49:38] <+PhantomMiG> @tank7013 This is from manga lore not current game lore.
[2:49:38] <+Neoepochx> Mother Brain is basically another one of those Brain CPUs
[2:49:38] <AsinPersuasion> aren't those late game spoilers?
[2:49:39] <iamnotaparrot> and the baby's dna
[2:49:39] <wantedsafe471> At this point, just how much of her dna human anymore?
[2:49:42] <%HollowedIdjit> guys stop saying spoilers
[2:49:42] <+HakureiIllusion> @0rond Yes and no, the Mawkin were on Zebes around the time of Super so Raven Beak probably dragged a half-dead Kraid back to ZDR
[2:49:43] <%rindy0> @brachydios777 I mean the emmi's weakness is literally mother brain's beam isn't it?
[2:49:50] <+Neoepochx> she was made by the Chozo too
[2:49:53] <+crudequip> !uptime
[2:49:53] <@Moobot> @crudequip WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 3 minutes
[2:50:16] <%tank7013> @brachydios777 What I didn't spoil the thing
[2:50:17] <BlackermanZX> theres a bunch of places you can go with storm missiles and space jump
[2:50:25] <+FlamingoJazz> @HollowedIdjit spoilers
[2:50:30] <+FlamingoJazz> :)
[2:50:42] <brachydios777> @tank7013 isn‚Äôt that revealed later?
[2:50:43] <%Prevot> @hakureiillusion wait there were living chozo on zebes during Super?
[2:50:47] <%HollowedIdjit> you win this time
[2:50:49] <%rindy0> it seemed clear to me that the "control units" are like mini mother brains that samus can absorb like the baby metroid absorbed mother brain's beam
[2:51:00] <+thelovingfool> space jump is the way forward I think? I get fuzzy at this point
[2:51:04] <%rindy0> so I don't think emmis would have helped vs her
[2:51:15] <iamnotaparrot> I thought the Emmy control things were aurora units from prime 3
[2:51:19] <GxthApology> Hey, Woolz. What's it like being the best Metroid player in your house?
[2:51:34] <%tank7013> @brachydios777 I don't remember when it pops up but I do know it's not at the same time as the thing
[2:51:45] <%tank7013> And isn't really important
[2:51:45] <+Demoli_PT> you can kill that bug things with storm missiles iirc
[2:51:52] <brachydios777> At the least space pirates would have been easy for the EMMIs
[2:51:54] <%Prevot> this whole series has a lot.of Mother Brain redos and they always go poorly
[2:51:59] <BlackermanZX> the parry hit never gets old
[2:52:21] <iamnotaparrot> what's up with the blue energy butterflies? they appear randomly in spots and the first emmi control unit was covered in them. do they get explained?
[2:52:21] <wantedsafe471> ruined
[2:52:38] <essence_of_lariatto> I think they're just space moths
[2:52:40] <%HollowedIdjit> I mean for the most part, the Aurora Units seemed fine with one exception
[2:52:44] <+Neoepochx> Space jump is the infinite jump right?
[2:52:45] <+AngryPhant0m> pc version??
[2:52:53] <%fetrigon> @neoepochx ye
[2:53:00] <%kyh9> I wish there was some elevator music
[2:53:00] <brachydios777> @angryphant0m Isn‚Äôt this Nintendo only?
[2:53:06] <+Neoepochx> Yeah, space jump breaks the game.
[2:53:06] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:53:08] <+Rekinsinn> Was other M officially written out of canon? I seem to recall that it establishes Mother Brain was one of a mass produced line of biological computers
[2:53:09] <%kyh9> Like a smooth jazz version of Metroid tunes
[2:53:17] <%tank7013> I think the butterflies are just supposed to be little guides to where you're supposed to go. But they aren't always placed well
[2:53:17] <+thelovingfool> the emulator already has dread
[2:53:20] <%HollowedIdjit> @rekinsinn No
[2:53:23] <+Neoepochx> @rekinsinn No
[2:53:24] <+Tucker0603> has woolie only killed 2 EMMI so far or only 2 left?
[2:53:31] <iamnotaparrot> other M is still Canon pretty sure
[2:53:32] <%HollowedIdjit> 2 left
[2:53:32] <%Prevot> @brachydios777 not if you ask Kotaku
[2:53:33] <BlackermanZX> 2 left
[2:53:35] <redwidow1358> 2 left
[2:53:36] <+NopeBadguy> Is this his second playthrough?
[2:53:37] <homestylewaffles> @Rekinsinn it's weird that that's info that's getting around. people really hate other M, but nothing contradicts it
[2:53:39] <+AngryPhant0m> @brachydios777 there is a emulator of it for pc
[2:53:41] <+MagiKestral> Other M is, unfortunately, canon
[2:53:41] <+Tucker0603> damn
[2:53:48] <iamnotaparrot> other M gets a nod in some of this games unlockable art cards
[2:53:52] <+thelovingfool> first playthrough
[2:53:53] <%kyh9> This is the switch version, not the Emulated one
[2:54:00] <brachydios777> Oh yeah, screw Kotaku for that
[2:54:04] <+TitaniumDragoonNeo> @MagiKestral But almost entirely ignored for this game.
[2:54:07] <+scwry> Other Ms story doesnt really have any great effect on the lore
[2:54:19] <BlackermanZX> didnt other m tie in with manga lore or somethin
[2:54:22] <essence_of_lariatto> other m is a pretty much entirely self contained story
[2:54:26] <+thelovingfool> you can space jump through water ye
[2:54:26] <+Neoepochx> Just explains where the Adam AI came from
[2:54:30] <brachydios777> Other M is pretty inconsequential
[2:54:33] <+Neoepochx> that is about it
[2:54:34] <TheHotStuven> LUL
[2:54:35] <%athuramn> except to instill a bunch of daddy issues
[2:54:39] <%Seancicle> contexte manquant
[2:54:41] <+SilverDevilfish> Other M contradicts Zero Mission due to how Samus' suit works
[2:54:42] <%Prevot> Jebaited
[2:54:43] <Tham1k> Jebaited
[2:54:44] <dan_g_v> of course
[2:54:45] <iamnotaparrot> other M just explained some lines samus says in fusion about the kind of person Adam was and how he died
[2:54:46] <+thelovingfool> troll
[2:54:53] <zanzibarian_hamster> Other M is to samus what the star wars prequels is to darth vader
[2:54:59] <+Tucker0603> what's the issue with other M I've heard it's bad but nothing else
[2:55:00] <+NopeBadguy> Jebaited
[2:55:00] <+Rekinsinn> I'm just saying, I don't find it to be very mysterious if the central units are clearly based on Mother brain given the lore
[2:55:22] <homestylewaffles> @Tucker0603 it had a badly told story and middling gameplay and people are real piss babies about it
[2:55:25] <Shwepie> @SilverDevilfish How does it contradict it?
[2:55:28] <brachydios777> That thumbs up and down shit was pretty cringe worthy
[2:55:36] <+D00msDayDan> again with this
[2:55:39] <+SilverDevilfish> How can she lose suit
[2:55:40] <+NickHatesSnow> @tucker0603 Very bad writing, linear, and weird controls. Otherwise perfectly fine.
[2:55:41] <$BallerSwagBro9k> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[2:55:43] <+SilverDevilfish> in Other M
[2:55:47] <+SilverDevilfish> err Zero Mission
[2:55:49] <%ZweihanderSteve> NO SHUT UP ITS FINE SHE KNOWS
[2:55:51] <+D00msDayDan> do you really think chozo technology is so primitive, woolie?
[2:55:54] <+SilverDevilfish> if in Other M it's based on focus
[2:55:55] <iamnotaparrot> other M has a terrible plot and localization, and it's a 3d action game only controllable with a single wii remote and no nunchuk
[2:56:00] <Shad0wTag> !uptime
[2:56:01] <@Moobot> @Shad0wTag WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 9 minutes
[2:56:01] <+SilverDevilfish> and she more or less always has it
[2:56:09] <+Neoepochx> I also bet Sylux is Adam's brother...
[2:56:09] <+scwry> other M does some really cool stuff
[2:56:13] <+scwry> like nightmare
[2:56:21] <brachydios777> Other M borders on 3rd birthday levels
[2:56:29] <redwidow1358> Sylux is Adam spelled backwards
[2:56:33] <iamnotaparrot> also Anthony "remember me" last name
[2:56:33] <%tank7013> @Tucker0603 It turned Samus into a whiney, bratty child with daddy issues and she cowers at the sight of Ridley despite having already fought him multiple times
[2:56:39] <%Prevot> God don't remind me of thos other bounty hunters from prime
[2:56:47] <Shwepie> @SilverDevilfish Different suit in Zero Mission, she picks up the one she has in Other M near the end of Zero Mission.
[2:56:49] <%Prevot> prime 4 story is probably gonna be awful
[2:56:49] <+Neoepochx> Other M is not even close to 3rd Birthday
[2:56:51] <wantedsafe471> Other M didnt kill the Metroid franchise
[2:57:14] <redwidow1358> Prime Hunters was decent and Sylux is a good character
[2:57:15] <+Neoepochx> @prevot You do realize that Sylux is going to be a plot point in 4 right?
[2:57:15] <+Jonesman64> i was soo spooked out at this underwater bit
[2:57:23] <BlackermanZX> 3rd birthay is way, way worse
[2:57:24] <+NickHatesSnow> Other M unlike 3rd birthday is still decent
[2:57:27] <%Prevot> yes and ai hate it
[2:57:41] <+Neoepochx> Not sure why. Hunters is fine
[2:57:47] <+MagiKestral> being able to skip all this with the sequence break is so good
[2:57:55] <+NickHatesSnow> Prime Hunters rules
[2:57:59] <brachydios777> With the Returns Remake, Samus beaten Ridley 3 freaking times before other M, her being scared still is so stupid
[2:58:05] <+Neoepochx> And, hot take, Fed Force is an okay game too.
[2:58:25] <iamnotaparrot> I absolutely cannot make it through any prime games. I don't think they're bad but I can't get far in prime 1 without getting bored. I admire them from afar
[2:58:25] <redwidow1358> That take isn't that hot tbh, people just hated it because it wasn't what they wanted
[2:58:27] <+NickHatesSnow> Federation Force was never bad, just bad timing
[2:58:29] <+Demoli_PT> you can ttotally make it tothat door
[2:58:29] <+scwry> maybe yes
[2:58:29] <BlackermanZX> you can totally get there with space jump
[2:58:30] <+HakureiIllusion> You can
[2:58:31] <essence_of_lariatto> remeber your grapple
[2:58:34] <DoctorMulholland> You totally can
[2:58:34] <+thelovingfool> you can totally can
[2:58:37] <+Jonesman64> you totes can
[2:58:40] <pi_in_the_sci> You totally can get there
[2:58:47] <+scwry> wortha try
[2:58:48] <marumariball> looks like you can reach it
[2:58:49] <ParCheesy> Grabba da blue, Woolie
[2:58:50] <redwidow1358> You totally can make that
[2:58:51] <+MagiKestral> grapple can grab blue, remember?
[2:58:52] <pi_in_the_sci> yeah, that just means two trips
[2:58:52] <+Neoepochx> @redwidow1358 @nickhatessnow I agree
[2:58:55] <SunsetJack> Woolie, grip platforms lowers.
[2:59:00] <+thelovingfool> you have... grap
[2:59:08] <iamnotaparrot> federation force is metroid's Book of Memories
[2:59:09] <BlackermanZX> ye it slides it down so it opens
[2:59:14] <wantedsafe471> Bet you cant make that jump
[2:59:36] <KasiCrafter> Nice
[2:59:40] <+Neoepochx> I think that Samus Returns might have suffered a similar fate of people throwing a tantrum if Prime 4 wasn't announced before it.
[2:59:52] <essence_of_lariatto> This is probably actually one of my favorite water levels in a 2d game
[2:59:57] <iamnotaparrot> MSR slapped though
[3:00:02] <essence_of_lariatto> it has really nice visuals and atmosphere
[3:00:15] <+Neoepochx> I don't think it would have been hit has hard as FF, but people are irrational and get mad at all sorts of bull shit
[3:00:15] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:00:27] <+thelovingfool> they make you WORK for this area but it's so worth it
[3:00:31] <Govoni> Collecting all the mini Xs is oddly satisfying
[3:00:40] <Blank9> this area was a lotta fun
[3:00:42] <essence_of_lariatto> imagine if this area had an emmi lol
[3:00:52] <BlackermanZX> man storm missile fucks
[3:00:55] <essence_of_lariatto> it's the only one without one
[3:00:57] <%tank7013> They should make another Metroid Prime Pinball
[3:01:02] <SunsetJack> That missile is doable funny enough.
[3:01:43] <iamnotaparrot> how? slide jump?
[3:01:43] <pi_in_the_sci> Mines work well on those vaccum guys
[3:01:53] <+Neoepochx> a single morph ball bomb kills those vacuum dudes
[3:01:55] <+thelovingfool> no save
[3:02:05] <+scwry> this area rocks
[3:02:08] <+Jonesman64> i love how you get to change the map
[3:02:59] <fairore> federation 2 anyone
[3:03:03] <+Rekinsinn> @Neoepochx and the bombs get sucked in faster than samus does
[3:03:07] <%Prevot> woolie def not finishing today
[3:03:08] <+thelovingfool> don't worry about it wool
[3:03:17] <Blank9> a federation force game that was more horror would be cool
[3:03:37] <Blank9> given how much atmosphere they can have even agaisnt samus being unstoppable, you'd be helpless as a fed trooper
[3:04:00] <+Neoepochx> Yeah, considering how much weaker fed soldiers are than Samus, you really need could have something where you shit bricks against some enemies
[3:04:05] <+alternative_flu> ngl those x parasites look good enough to eat
[3:04:11] <wantedsafe471> Federation force as a horror game? That sounds pretty good
[3:04:16] <+alternative_flu> they're like floating gummy candies
[3:04:17] <%Prevot> forbidden jello
[3:04:19] <omnishadeee> fed trooper when he sees 6 ft armoured woman speeding towards him at mach 2 full sprint
[3:04:22] <+Neoepochx> but also it is kinda sandbagged by the multiplayer nature of the game too
[3:04:26] <+scwry> whaleeee
[3:04:26] <$NitronStreams> SOON
[3:04:35] <faeron93> where's the giant sea monster that's gonna show up
[3:04:35] <+Neoepochx> it is hard to be scared in multiplayer.
[3:04:38] <+alternative_flu> @Prevot dude, yes
[3:04:39] <essence_of_lariatto> Squale
[3:04:58] <%tank7013> The problem with federation force it that it implies the federation could ever be competent Kappa
[3:05:04] <Dave_VD> Squig
[3:05:09] <Dave_VD> Octobussy
[3:05:12] <fairore> @tank7013 wow lol
[3:05:14] <Darren716> Miss anything big in the last half hour?
[3:05:14] <wantedsafe471> Which cant ever be
[3:05:23] <+Jonesman64> I just need some X Gummies to nom
[3:05:23] <Darren716> Last thing I saw was storm missiles
[3:05:29] <%Prevot> man stop reminding me of Federation Force ai just wanna forget that garbage ever existed
[3:05:33] <+scwry> remember diffusion
[3:05:33] <BlackermanZX> charge shot
[3:05:37] <+Demoli_PT> diffusion BEAM
[3:05:37] <fairore> i hope that changes honestly
[3:05:38] <+Neoepochx> @tank7013 FeelsBadMan for the federation equivalent of stormtroopets
[3:05:38] <thackattack00> diffusion woolie
[3:05:38] <+Jonesman64> DIFFUSION BEAM
[3:05:39] <+HakureiIllusion> Diffusion beam
[3:05:39] <pi_in_the_sci> You should be able to hit that red spot
[3:05:40] <SunsetJack> Lol
[3:05:42] <omnishadeee> no woolie thats now
[3:05:43] <+thelovingfool> remember your shot type
[3:05:43] <KasiCrafter> Diffusion beam
[3:05:45] <PassVGC> uh oh
[3:05:50] <+scwry> youre stuck here anyway lol
[3:05:54] <+thelovingfool> he forgot
[3:05:56] <+Slattsquatch> I got stuck in this room for like 5 minutes because I forgot the DIffusion beam was a thing LUL
[3:05:59] <%tank7013> @Neoepochx At least they look cooler
[3:06:01] <BlackermanZX> we good
[3:06:02] <Blank9> Higgs was pretty cool in Other M, only good fed soldier
[3:06:02] <+Atomic_ColliderSG> people backseat this game so hard LUL
[3:06:06] <+Neoepochx> Although, TIE Fighter is a hell of a game.
[3:06:19] <Shwepie> @fairore He's right though. Bounty Hunters exist because the Federation Police were so incompetent at handling Space Pirates the Federation government started paying freelancers.
[3:06:20] <thetntm> the game traps you there until you figure it out and chat still goes crazy
[3:06:23] <Qsmash_> its the back seating olympics in here
[3:06:27] <omnishadeee> imo that platform entrance is bit hard to see against the background
[3:06:36] <%BananaSlammuh> @Atomic_ColliderSG and this chat is one of the worst. Luckily, Woolie pays it no mind LUL
[3:06:39] <%tank7013> There was a soldier in other M named Higgs? LUL
[3:06:41] <+thelovingfool> suck my dick
[3:06:52] <+Jonesman64> he does one thing.. and he does it well
[3:06:57] <omnishadeee> chat getting off on shitting on people once again
[3:06:57] <+Neoepochx> It isn't like Woolie even reads chat anyway.
[3:06:58] <brachydios777> Mmm
[3:07:03] <$NitronStreams> Cool story bro
[3:07:17] <Dave_VD> Feels weirdly lonely when Reggie isn‚Äôt around
[3:07:17] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:07:21] <+Neoepochx> @jonesman64 Play Blanka against Daigo?
[3:07:46] <wantedsafe471> How are we supposed to believe the federation is competent when nearly every time we see them do something, they fail
[3:08:04] <pi_in_the_sci> invisible
[3:08:05] <+Neoepochx> Truly the Stormtroopers of Metroid
[3:08:06] <DontChuckle98> @Dave_VD Now we know how Samus feels. lol
[3:08:07] <+Jonesman64> I mean they did a pretty good job of raising metroids
[3:08:08] <+ShutUpAceyP> lol
[3:08:30] <homestylewaffles> @wantedsafe471 you ever work in tech support? when your job is fixing problems, it seems like everything is a problem cause that's all they throw at you.
[3:08:36] <Carlioo> they did a good job of creating anti-samus tech
[3:08:39] <Blank9> I mean the federation made 7 whole EMMIs, that's something
[3:08:46] <%tank7013> And when the federation does do something properly it's when they're doing something evil. And then they fuck up and die because they were trying to clone metroids
[3:08:59] <NiniGiovanini> for a second there I got worried
[3:09:01] <omnishadeee> if u pay attention to the feds through the games their tech is actually growing at an alarming rate
[3:09:12] <+MagiKestral> you're able to sequence break here from the elevator room thanks to a speed booster path, saves you the whole trip to get here
[3:09:16] <+Neoepochx> "Sorry Samus, won't do it again. Promise!"
[3:09:25] <omnishadeee> in other m they have a barely usable plasma but in fusion its full power so strong they hesitate giving it to samus
[3:09:25] <Blank9> missed
[3:09:28] <+Demoli_PT> you can diffusion if you shoot that
[3:09:29] <iamnotaparrot> you can hit that
[3:09:34] <linSP> I got an idea, let‚Äôs make an indestructible war machine, what‚Äôs the worst that‚Äôll happen
[3:09:36] <homestylewaffles> lol they don't have to apologize to samus, she's a contractor at best
[3:09:38] <+scwry> the sequence break route
[3:09:49] <+thelovingfool> you got this Woolie
[3:09:55] <+Demoli_PT> no, by the right opening
[3:10:04] <+NeonNobleKalzeria> don't forget your diffusion beam, they kinda go a while without using it
[3:10:10] <+Neoepochx> Woolie will try for an hour to bomb jump, but gives up on shooting that red shot. Kappa
[3:10:22] <+NeonNobleKalzeria> LUL
[3:10:26] <%tank7013> @homestylewaffles I would definitely go out of my way to apologize to a woman that could singlehandedly annihilate me
[3:10:31] <iamnotaparrot> uh oh
[3:10:35] <+Tucker0603> is the triple shot not the diffusion beam?
[3:10:41] <+scwry> no
[3:10:42] <Carlioo> almost as if you need some sort of wavy beam...
[3:10:44] <hassanico2> Wide
[3:10:49] <NiniGiovanini> he forgor
[3:10:50] <iamnotaparrot> !speedrun at risk!
[3:10:57] <+scwry> tripel shot is the spazer/wide beam
[3:10:59] <mothdude> Diffusion Beam is the one that explodes on impact when you charge it.
[3:11:00] <SunsetJack> Diffusion is the explosion from the charge shot when it lands.
[3:11:05] <+Neoepochx> @tank7013 They should stop crossing their fingers when they say they'll stop
[3:11:07] <hassanico2> Charge->Wide->Plasma->(Ice would usually be here)->Wave
[3:11:14] <hassanico2> I think that's the usual order
[3:11:18] <+VictorVonLouche> Not gonna hit it
[3:11:19] <homestylewaffles> @tank7013 which is why you not apologize to her 30 light years away, take your pension, and bounce LUL
[3:11:20] <omnishadeee> its aoe
[3:11:37] <essence_of_lariatto> plasma is usually the final
[3:11:37] <+MagiKestral> the one deep in the wall is only a cessible from the other side
[3:11:39] <+thelovingfool> he had the right ide
[3:11:45] <%tank7013> @Neoepochx Hey if it means more games they can tape them together crossed for all I care
[3:11:50] <iamnotaparrot> plasma is usually last beam you get
[3:11:59] <hassanico2> nope
[3:12:04] <hassanico2> Hasn't been true for at least 2 games
[3:12:14] <BlackermanZX> you can lean into the wall and shoot
[3:12:15] <+VictorVonLouche> Just charge beam it
[3:12:17] <hassanico2> (Fusion, Samus Returns)
[3:12:25] <mothdude> nice
[3:12:25] <+scwry> thats one way lol
[3:12:25] <+ShinobiPhoenix> but the power that let you shoot through walls was the WAVE Beam. I wonder where you would get a power that let's you SHOOT THROUGH WALLS AND IS ELECTRIC
[3:12:26] <%tank7013> @homestylewaffles Knowing the federation they would accidentally jump into the Ridley space dragon homeworld or some shit
[3:12:45] <+alternative_flu> Samus pull out game is pretty strong
[3:12:52] <%Deft_Thought> Oh, the lighting made that awkward
[3:12:54] <homestylewaffles> @tank7013 "yooooo one more job I swear"
[3:12:55] <NiniGiovanini> oh boy
[3:13:06] <NiniGiovanini> yay!
[3:13:07] <%tank7013> @homestylewaffles LUL
[3:13:15] <iamnotaparrot> do we have confirmation that this games kraid is the same as the on in super or OG?
[3:13:16] <BlackermanZX> oh shit is it time
[3:13:20] <+scwry> @ShinobiPhoenix chill
[3:13:25] <+spawnzie> Best suit
[3:13:26] <+Jonesman64> HERE WE GOO

[3:13:38] <$BallerSwagBro9k> BECOME WOOLIE
[3:13:38] <$NitronStreams> GRAVITY IS NOW YOUR BITCH
[3:13:40] <+Neoepochx> Gotta say extended underwater sections without gravity suit is my least favorite thing in any metroid
[3:13:41] <%Prevot> BEST SUIT
[3:13:42] <+spawnzie> So clean
[3:13:46] <%tank7013> And now he's unstoppable
[3:13:47] <brachydios777> PURPLE
[3:13:48] <StarMechV> SAMUS GOT THE DRIP
[3:13:49] <+HakureiIllusion> ZDR: Become Woolie
[3:13:49] <+ShinobiPhoenix> PIMP
[3:13:50] <%LastHazzerd> it looks SO GOOD
[3:13:50] <gaminglink25> it looks so clean
[3:13:53] <linSP> woolie suit
[3:13:54] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @NiniGiovanini
[3:13:55] <glass_marcus> we got eva units now
[3:13:57] <$NitronStreams> ITS SO FUCKING SLICK
[3:13:57] <redwidow1358> The colors on this are fucking great
[3:13:58] <sirjames079> LOVE the Gravity Suit
[3:13:59] <+Tucker0603> that's rad
[3:14:01] <thackattack00> i like how the green lights extend down
[3:14:04] <oneimportantthing> Best suit
[3:14:06] <iamnotaparrot> she had her sweater. she can go to cold rooms now
[3:14:07] <%ZweihanderSteve> colours of a CHAMPION
[3:14:15] <%tank7013> This is probably my favorite gravity suit
[3:14:19] <oneimportantthing> WOOLIE COLORS
[3:14:19] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1447814216103104512?t=FMN9Zf2S4JsthZvBIlfXDQ&s=19
[3:14:22] <iamnotaparrot> it looks SICK glowing in dark rooms
[3:14:27] <+LazyAss24Seven> jaboodyBust jaboodyBust jaboodyBust
[3:14:34] <wantedsafe471> Wait, so its both the gravity suit and varia suit in one?
[3:14:41] <+Neoepochx> Yes
[3:14:42] <+Jonesman64> god all the suits in this looked really good
[3:14:42] <hassanico2> Wow almost like Samus is Green and Purple now Kappa
[3:14:43] <NotHereToStream> eva coloured
[3:14:46] <brachydios777> @wantedsafe471 Varia stacks
[3:14:46] <+VictorVonLouche> In the end game now
[3:14:48] <$NitronStreams> SAMUS GOT THE DRIP
[3:14:49] <+MagiKestral> varia doesn't help against lsva
[3:14:52] <%Prevot> Samus Returns is my favorite Gravity Suit, but this one is the best in this game
[3:14:54] <+ShinobiPhoenix> Purple and Green, so Samus is an Eva or a Villain now
[3:14:55] <%tank7013> @wantedsafe471 Varia lets you do hot rooms. Gravity is for cold
[3:14:55] <+Neoepochx> @hassanico2 Kappa
[3:14:56] <%Deft_Thought> I still think Gold and white is the hottest
[3:15:03] <oneimportantthing> We endgame now bois
[3:15:05] <wantedsafe471> ah, ok
[3:15:06] <+thelovingfool> the white makes me actually like grav suit
[3:15:07] <SunsetJack> And he was about to leave the area at one point lol
[3:15:08] <%MegadBlitz> damn look at those colors reminds me of a certain streamer
[3:15:14] <%Deft_Thought> But a Unit 0-1 is fine too, I guess
[3:15:14] <NiniGiovanini> wait I cant use caps?
[3:15:22] <+scwry> woolie suit
[3:15:23] <%Prevot> Gravity is only for cold now cause Samus is weak to cold like a Metroid
[3:15:29] <+Tucker0603> I'm glad she still has the orange on her
[3:15:36] <%Prevot> before the Varia was enough for cold areas
[3:15:37] <+Neoepochx> Samus just walk around the pole.
[3:15:39] <+D00msDayDan> gravity keeps you warm
[3:15:42] <Paperware> Is it just me or does the Varia Suit looks kinda bad versus the Chad Gravity suit in this game?
[3:15:47] <+VictorVonLouche> How can this be?
[3:15:49] <+scwry> fusion varia is the worst suit in the series
[3:15:53] <iamnotaparrot> she's weak to cold because she was injected with the baby
[3:16:14] <fairore> @iamnotaparrot the baby
[3:16:15] <wantedsafe471> THE BABY
[3:16:16] <reginault> REALLY? PURPLE AND GREEN? im so surprised
[3:16:20] <BlackermanZX> woopsie
[3:16:20] <+ShinobiPhoenix> @tank7013 in this game, yes. but there's no lore explanation for why the Varia capability to protect from Cold is missing when it's been there since Super INCLUDING Fusion
[3:16:22] <%BananaSlammuh> @scwry It do be ugly. It looks better in the closeup cutscene
[3:16:23] <iamnotaparrot> @scwry you hating on the watermelon suit?
[3:16:23] <hassanico2> They work QUICK
[3:16:24] <Treasure_Vault> X pretty bad
[3:16:24] <omnishadeee> @Paperware i mean it would be kinda weird if it looked worse, its an upgrade
[3:16:26] <lambishly> is that the Kagatsuhi?
[3:16:29] <+TitaniumDragoonNeo> @iamnotaparrot the B A B Y
[3:16:29] <zanzibarian_hamster> woof
[3:16:31] <+VictorVonLouche> They end planets
[3:16:31] <%RealThiele> shis fucked
[3:16:32] <wantedsafe471> Wow, that was fast
[3:16:33] <+scwry> @iamnotaparrot you mean the clown vomit suit?
[3:16:34] <redwidow1358> Planet's fucked
[3:16:36] <%Deft_Thought> monkaS Uh oh
[3:16:37] <%RealThiele> TIME TO NUKE IT ALL
[3:16:42] <+thelovingfool> literally the flood
[3:16:45] <%tank7013> @ShinobiPhoenix I was assuming it was because of *spoilers*
[3:16:46] <+Neoepochx> @lambishly Nice
[3:16:49] <+Jonesman64> global warming is fake news see Kappa
[3:16:52] <iamnotaparrot> t h e b a b y
[3:16:53] <mothdude> X: Samus a Metroid? Freeze everything!
[3:16:53] <Asuterisuku> It's almost like that's why they're dangerous.
[3:16:58] <+vaderxyz1970> The X produce 10 times the greenhouse gasses of a car
[3:17:02] <brachydios777> Flood
[3:17:03] <%Prevot> as seen in Fusion, X are actually smart
[3:17:07] <wantedsafe471> Do i hear an exterminatus is needed?
[3:17:09] <NiniGiovanini> eyeball? more life bologna
[3:17:12] <hassanico2> ALso this only happened cause Samus exterminated Metroids
[3:17:18] <essence_of_lariatto> they're really teasing ya
[3:17:21] <omnishadeee> soon attack
[3:17:26] <+alternative_flu> gotta hop out hope woolie continues to enjoy dread!
[3:17:28] <Carlioo> really makes you wanna screw something
[3:17:28] <+ShutUpAceyP> is samus tsun tsun?
[3:17:31] <+VictorVonLouche> YES
[3:17:32] <brachydios777> X are like Metroid‚Äôs flood huh?
[3:17:34] <iamnotaparrot> are the X themselves intelligent? or do they just gain the intelligence if what they mimic?
[3:17:35] <+scwry> watch you know about rolling down in the deep, when your brain goes numb you can call that area freeze
[3:17:37] <+thelovingfool> yes
[3:17:39] <+Neoepochx> As soon as you get it, traversal in this game becomes trivial.
[3:17:48] <+ShinobiPhoenix> we need X on Earth, fix Global Warming AND humanity in one clean step
[3:17:52] <+Jonesman64> he doesn't have much choice here lol
[3:17:57] <linSP> is it weird to think that every  game takes place within a day for samus
[3:18:08] <+thelovingfool> you're locked the fuck in
[3:18:09] <Shwepie> Woolie has been trapped, how long before he realizes?
[3:18:10] <+Neoepochx> Sounds plausible
[3:18:10] <Carlioo> LOCKED IN
[3:18:17] <BlackermanZX> you can always come back later anyways

[3:18:19] <Shad0wTag> @linSP Samus speedruns in real life
[3:18:24] <essence_of_lariatto> The game pinholes you here for the next sequence to make sense
[3:18:25] <wantedsafe471> Locked in a cold box with some x
[3:18:37] <%Charronia> @iamnotaparrot The X seem to have just enough intelligence to counter Samus' tactics, but are otherwise described as parasites that only seek to consume
[3:18:43] <+VictorVonLouche> Wish ADAM just locks the door you came through some times.
[3:18:45] <%tank7013> @iamnotaparrot They were smart enough to mimic samus without taking her over, so maybe?
[3:18:59] <%LastHazzerd> @VictorVonLouche folk HATED that in Fusion
[3:18:59] <$NitronStreams> MAP CLEARING TIME
[3:19:01] <+thelovingfool> haha sure
[3:19:06] <OfficerMods> x parasites are as only as smart as their hosts
[3:19:07] <BlackermanZX> goddamn this load screen is sick
[3:19:21] <+VictorVonLouche> @VictorVonLouche Better than wasting half an hour of pointless back track
[3:19:32] <+ShinobiPhoenix> X work FAST
[3:19:32] <+Neoepochx> @lasthazzerd The way it is done here is a bit more natural
[3:19:34] <churropoppa> Is it me or is this the easiest metroid to get lost in?
[3:19:35] <OfficerMods> so like a x that takes on the form of a zoomer can't start a self destruct sequence on a computer they need a science man
[3:19:39] <brachydios777> It seems like the whole X thing would have been avoided if the Chozo just modified themselves instead
[3:19:40] <KasiCrafter> Climate Change D:
[3:19:57] <%LastHazzerd> @Neoepochx yep, feels a lot less bad in that regard
[3:19:57] <iamnotaparrot> when you forget the AC on when you leave for work
[3:20:01] <+Slattsquatch> @churropoppa Metroid 1 doesn't even have a map
[3:20:01] <%RealThiele> @brachydios777 but were perfect wehhhhh
[3:20:02] <+Tucker0603> freaking X running their fossil fuels
[3:20:09] <+VictorVonLouche> This can not be
[3:20:11] <+vaderxyz1970> Who left the freezer open
[3:20:12] <OfficerMods> and that explains why sa-x uses speed run strats
[3:20:17] <+scwry> thats not a speedboost block
[3:20:19] <thackattack00> woolie it's screw attack
[3:20:20] <%Prevot> ...
[3:20:20] <omnishadeee> woolie thats not speedbooster symbol
[3:20:21] <SunsetJack> Lol
[3:20:22] <+Jonesman64> .. wrong move woolie
[3:20:22] <Texeu> xD
[3:20:23] <Qsmash_> woolie will figure it out
[3:20:23] <BlackermanZX> actually its the whole wall
[3:20:23] <+VictorVonLouche> What is woolie DOING
[3:20:24] <hassanico2> Streamer lacks critical information :)
[3:20:27] <churropoppa> @churropoppa fair. I didn't play that one
[3:20:28] <TheHotStuven> LOL
[3:20:30] <OfficerMods> blind streamer?
[3:20:32] <TioXyco> LUL
[3:20:34] <+thelovingfool> blind
[3:20:42] <%tank7013> Like it said in the opening, x parasites take their target's memories as well. So like if they took over someone that knew nuclear launch codes or some shit it would be a PROBLEM
[3:20:59] <$NitronStreams> Gee I wonder what the next power up is
[3:21:03] <%aram909> aram909 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months, currently on a 11 month streak! woolie, pls
[3:21:07] <+MagiKestral> you CAN get that statue earlier than intended
[3:21:07] <+VictorVonLouche> @tank7013 Why the fuck would an x parasite use nukes though LOL
[3:21:11] <thackattack00> but their goal is to spread, not mindlessly destroy @tank7013
[3:21:14] <+thelovingfool> I wonder... what's the next post up guys?
[3:21:14] <wantedsafe471> WOuld the x launch a nuke though? no hosts left afterwards
[3:21:17] <+KisukeOboro> ice is usually frozen, yes
[3:21:20] <essence_of_lariatto> oh they will
[3:21:20] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:21:23] <OfficerMods> fuck dem metroids nuke da world - x
[3:21:24] <hassanico2> @VictorVonLouche last time the X repeatedly tried to crash the SPace Station
[3:21:27] <%tank7013> The X would totally nuke Samus
[3:21:27] <%Prevot> IIRC the X turn into a human and intentionally tries to crash the BSL on the planet to kill Samus in Fusion
[3:21:29] <%BananaSlammuh> @tank7013 Which happens in Fusion with the x scientist
[3:21:31] <BlackermanZX> ticklin the morph balls
[3:21:36] <hassanico2> Like more than once the X have valued killing Samus over self-preservation
[3:21:40] <KasiCrafter> If they can blue ball you on the Morph Ball, they can screw you out of a Screw ATtack, lol
[3:21:44] <+D00msDayDan> gee i wonder
[3:21:44] <iamnotaparrot> can the cast of resident evil stop an isolated x parasite outbreak?
[3:21:48] <apolitenoob> I thought X couldn't survive cold? My fusion lore is spotty
[3:21:49] <+thelovingfool> it may. be
[3:21:56] <+VictorVonLouche> @hassanico2 Cause you a METROID was a problem that required extreme action.
[3:21:59] <hassanico2> @apolitenoob that's just metroids
[3:22:00] <linSP> the s blocks stand for sussy
[3:22:01] <thackattack00> X are cool with cold, Metroids hate it
[3:22:05] <%tank7013> Killing Samus IS self preservation for them. She's their only remaining predator
[3:22:10] <apolitenoob> Ah that's what it was, thanks y'all
[3:22:14] <hassanico2> X are the legit ultimate predator
[3:22:18] <%Prevot> nah X are like najim buu only completely atomizing them works
[3:22:21] <IceyCone> X intentionally get cold so Samus got hurt absorbing them
[3:22:26] <%Prevot> *majin buu
[3:22:29] <+scwry> lets go
[3:22:33] <+Slattsquatch> X are PG-rated The thing
[3:22:33] <+Neoepochx> As Civvie says, the Valve Technique of Blue Ballin' you
[3:22:37] <hassanico2> CHOZO SOLDIER
[3:22:45] <iamnotaparrot> x parasites in fusion evolved to have freeze powers and would hunt samus in noct to freeze her for 100 damage
[3:22:47] <+MagiKestral> RED ONE
[3:22:48] <%LastHazzerd> Protoman Rak'Shi
[3:22:50] <IceyCone> then when they saw she had varia on they were like "Oh Shit" and flew away whenever you came near them
[3:22:54] <+TitaniumDragoonNeo> RED ONI
[3:23:00] <brachydios777> So Subzero would kick the shit out of Metroids
[3:23:01] <+eanscrale> Nuking metroids would probably be a very bad idea for the x, if how they adapted to phazon is any indication
[3:23:03] <iamnotaparrot> if you shine spark him you shatter the shield and instantly move him to phase 2
[3:23:07] <TheHotStuven> that does 2 etanks LOL
[3:23:10] <wantedsafe471> Wait, is that a chozo robot or an actual chozo?
[3:23:11] <+VictorVonLouche> dead
[3:23:13] <+vaderxyz1970> Man how did the space pirates kill this warrior race in the first place
[3:23:13] <BlackermanZX> that move hurts a LOT
[3:23:13] <+Neoepochx> Wow
[3:23:19] <Carlioo> @wantedsafe471 actual dead chozo
[3:23:20] <bobdoletrasher> lock on more than once
[3:23:20] <+Slattsquatch> That attack does INSANE damage for some reason
[3:23:23] <%tank7013> @wantedsafe471 An x parasite chozo
[3:23:23] <IceyCone> actual Chozo
[3:23:27] <+samuraicaveman> it's an X-infected chozo
[3:23:30] <thackattack00> yeah enemies start to shit damage at this point for some reason
[3:23:31] <NiniGiovanini> coward chozo
[3:23:32] <wantedsafe471> ah, that makes sense
[3:23:34] <hassanico2> @vaderxyz1970 they were half and half. The space pirates only got the peaceful ones.
[3:23:35] <Dave_VD> ‚ÄúWhat was that black goo?‚Äù
[3:23:39] <mothdude> nice
[3:23:41] <%Prevot> the Venom style ones are actual chozo taken over by X, the others are robots
[3:23:43] <dan_g_v> yum yum!!
[3:23:47] <+Neoepochx> Hmm, maybe I should have used Storm Missiles more
[3:23:47] <hassanico2> @vaderxyz1970 The actual warrior race was here, until the X got them
[3:23:49] <brachydios777> @dave_vd X
[3:23:57] <%Deft_Thought> Shield or no, y'all can all gonna get fed. Plasma for everybody
[3:24:00] <+Slattsquatch> @thackattack00 "The Gravity Suit significantly reduces damage" Bitch you thought
[3:24:05] <thackattack00> lmao true
[3:24:09] <%tank7013> Holy shit
[3:24:10] <%Deft_Thought> DAMN
[3:24:22] <linSP> these guys are Iudex gundyr but with x instead of Aldrich goop
[3:24:22] <churropoppa> yo wtf
[3:24:25] <+Neoepochx> Counter prevents that explosion
[3:24:28] <+Jonesman64> I didn't know they did that..
[3:24:29] <+LazyAss24Seven> ouch, that didn't happen to me, lol
[3:24:32] <NiniGiovanini> oh CONGRATS that guy kicked my ass
[3:24:39] <omnishadeee> i think u can hit this guy when hes in the ground with charged beam
[3:24:59] <hassanico2> ?
[3:25:03] <+Neoepochx> ??
[3:25:06] <+VictorVonLouche> ???
[3:25:11] <Carlioo> hey it worked
[3:25:13] <NiniGiovanini> speed
[3:25:17] <Treasure_Vault> neat
[3:25:17] <%tank7013> Shine sparking into a ramp puts you back in speed boost mode
[3:25:18] <+vaderxyz1970> That was less impactfull that i though it would be
[3:25:21] <Blank9> get fucked, random enemy
[3:25:26] <Treasure_Vault> that works
[3:25:31] <iamnotaparrot> thank God this game doesn't have any x parasite puzzles. like the golden space pirate and golden crab locked doors in fusion
[3:25:38] <+VictorVonLouche> Woolie why
[3:25:43] <+Neoepochx> Wur?
[3:25:51] <Dave_VD> Cool how the scan moves into the background
[3:25:56] <+thelovingfool> thinking way too hard
[3:26:02] <+VictorVonLouche> Oh no
[3:26:06] <omnishadeee> u can just jump up next to it
[3:26:12] <thackattack00> ???
[3:26:13] <Qsmash_> ???
[3:26:16] <iamnotaparrot> just store it wtf
[3:26:17] <BurdRightsActivist> Just jump??
[3:26:19] <hassanico2> noice
[3:26:28] <+VictorVonLouche> Oh no again
[3:26:31] <hassanico2> also speed blocks never regen?
[3:26:36] <NiniGiovanini> woolie...
[3:26:38] <iamnotaparrot> ayyyy
[3:26:40] <hassanico2> yo TEN missiles?!
[3:26:42] <thackattack00> yeah they're destroyed forever
[3:26:43] <BlackermanZX> eyy
[3:26:46] <+Slattsquatch> This is probably the easiest shinespark puzzle tbh
[3:26:46] <IceyCone> not in this game, no
[3:26:46] <+Neoepochx> @hassanico2 They don't
[3:26:55] <%Prevot> I think speed block being gone forever is a first for this game
[3:26:57] <+Neoepochx> also, "overthinking"
[3:27:02] <Carlioo> there are some that are destroyed forever
[3:27:15] <hassanico2> oh wow that's how you kill X Chozos quickly?!
[3:27:17] <+VictorVonLouche> Otherthinks yet totally blind to the obvious secrets
[3:27:22] <hassanico2> They took so much fire if you don't counter
[3:27:33] <+Neoepochx> @hassanico2 Yes, shooting takes way too long
[3:27:43] <Carlioo> my man's cold
[3:27:52] <+Neoepochx> The melee counter is key in this game.
[3:27:54] <Carlioo> icicles hanging from his hand
[3:27:58] <+Take_2_shots> that's the charge beam room I think
[3:28:13] <Bennett_Fracture> man i cant wait for this game to be on sell...
[3:28:16] <Bennett_Fracture> yep...
[3:28:24] <hassanico2> there ya go
[3:28:24] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:28:26] <hassanico2> oh
[3:28:27] <%LastHazzerd> so close
[3:28:29] <%LastHazzerd> there
[3:28:32] <Bennett_Fracture> price drop could happen any day now...
[3:28:40] <BlackermanZX> the super blueballs
[3:28:40] <Asuterisuku> That's where you got the Charge Beam.
[3:29:02] <hassanico2> Sad to see the tutorial zone so fucked
[3:29:04] <TheHotStuven> whoops! Frozen!
[3:29:11] <DopeCantaloupe420> Just finished my speed playthrough and I was almost exactly 10 minutes too slow to get the the bonus thing.
[3:29:21] <+Jonesman64> god could you imagine if you didn't have the grav suit at this point some how..
[3:29:27] <+Neoepochx> >Popular Nintendo games going on sale LUL
[3:29:30] <schoolisforwinners> I would have been 10 minutes slow too if I ddint do the gravity sequence break
[3:29:30] <hassanico2> @DopeCantaloupe420 damn that means you got the Other M thing :)
[3:29:33] <Asuterisuku> LUL
[3:29:48] <%ekodrop> i mean it was 10 off at walmart during release
[3:30:01] <hassanico2> Yo ADAM how do I melt this shit
[3:30:11] <%BananaSlammuh> another great boss coming up
[3:30:12] <dan_g_v> so Woolie got the early monhun pc demo, right?
[3:30:19] <+Neoepochx> A lot of stores will do launch sales, but there will be none from N.
[3:30:28] <iamnotaparrot> another boss you can shinespark
[3:30:36] <Dave_VD> Do all the bosses have unique parry animations?
[3:30:44] <%ekodrop> y
[3:30:46] <dan_g_v> seems like it
[3:30:54] <$NitronStreams> A VITAL ABILITY
[3:30:55] <Asuterisuku> All of them.
[3:30:59] <+Neoepochx> Yes
[3:31:02] <Dave_VD> That‚Äôs tight
[3:31:02] <hassanico2> Xs love fucking with ACs
[3:31:11] <+scwry> fusion fans are eating
[3:31:12] <gaminglink25> vital ability hmm
[3:31:14] <omnishadeee> @Dave_VD there are major and minor bosses, all the major ones do and the minor repeated ones share the same animations
[3:31:18] <%Charronia> Unclog the X-filled vents
[3:31:19] <+Jonesman64> oh come on.. they're just.. chilling
[3:31:20] <+Neoepochx> They love Central Heating and Cooling
[3:31:33] <%GeneralSCPatton> X are terrifying for being able to mess with infrastructure and critical systems
[3:31:34] <+HakureiIllusion> In both Fusion and Dread the X are genre-savvy enough to try and close off the routes to Samus's upgrades
[3:31:34] <%tank7013> x is like "lmao their bill is gonna be so high this month"
[3:31:35] <Carlioo> the X parasite: tries to turn an entire planet into an ice world just so they can stop samus
[3:31:47] <hassanico2> "My Roommate is an X Parasite", the hit new comedy series on GalFed TV
[3:31:47] <+Neoepochx> I bet they would make great HVAC repair-parasites
[3:31:52] <iamnotaparrot> X-parasites are an HVAC worker's worst nightmare
[3:32:05] <+sphiraki> i got stuck in this corner for awhile too
[3:32:10] <JackCheeseJ> An X left the fridge open. Samus, the fridge is impervious to all your current weaponry.
[3:32:18] <+Neoepochx> @iamnotaparrot Psychic connection.
[3:32:21] <Darren716> Ah damn I missed him getting the grav suit
[3:32:33] <hassanico2> Gonna need to power bomb the popcorn again
[3:32:49] <iamnotaparrot> "Samus I did not authorize you to raise the temperature on the thermostat"
[3:32:55] <+superchronicc> wollie is already this far? dayum
[3:33:10] <iamnotaparrot> @superchronicc he's like 12 hours in
[3:33:21] <+ShutUpAceyP> he's enjoying his time
[3:33:23] <JackCheeseJ> You will need to find a way to interface with the fridge's door mechanism and return it to its "closed" position.
[3:33:32] <iamnotaparrot> 8 hours yesterday. 4 so far today just about
[3:33:33] <+superchronicc> @iamnotaparrot still though
[3:33:52] <brachydios777> Woolie can totally finish today
[3:33:55] <%ekodrop> lol
[3:34:31] <+superchronicc> this game is pretty fun but you are on rails for a good bit
[3:34:47] <iamnotaparrot> I know it's not feasible with the asset quality and time needed but man I wish this game went full Hollow Knight and had like 30 unique bosses and 30+ hours of areas a content
[3:34:49] <Dave_VD> Yo chat is Travis Strikes Again fun? I‚Äôve heard you need to play it to understand some of the story in NMH3 but I could just watch the cutscenes if the game itself isn‚Äôt great
[3:35:04] <+thelovingfool> it's mid
[3:35:16] <%ekodrop> meh
[3:35:16] <brachydios777> You think X could infect Flood, Flood couldn‚Äôt infect X cause no spine
[3:35:16] <%Prevot> honestly this already feels like the longest Metroid game
[3:35:21] <iamnotaparrot> I've only played NMH2 and 3 and it all amd perfect sense to me.
[3:35:41] <brachydios777> *or nervous system
[3:35:42] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:35:53] <Deasmeister> @iamnotaparrot Metroid 2d doesn't really do npc and lore stuff like hollow knight to justify it though imo
[3:35:57] <Darren716> Up
[3:35:58] <dan_g_v> too cold
[3:36:02] <Asuterisuku> If it mafe sense to you you're a liar.
[3:36:05] <+thelovingfool> gotta counter kill
[3:36:08] <Dave_VD> Cool, thanks guys
[3:36:12] <Shwepie> It's a beam spam trap.
[3:36:21] <+MagiKestral> there's a tiny hidden block you need to break in order to progress here and I got stuck real bad
[3:36:44] <+MagiKestral> well it's not HERE here, but ya know
[3:36:47] <wantedsafe471> Regardless of who absorbs who, we all lose
[3:36:49] <BlackermanZX> they are so teasing that power up
[3:37:14] <+superchronicc> woolie will "figure it out" on metroid dread
[3:37:37] <%Prevot> did woolie not hear the computer tell him where to go?
[3:37:46] <wantedsafe471> Snailoid
[3:37:54] <iamnotaparrot> @deasmeister you could just pull the crap uncharted does and have Adam give you missions that lead to more and more missions with minor clues along the way
[3:37:55] <omnishadeee> u are kinda locked out of going anywhere else, progress is a hidden block under a missile upgrade u picked up recently
[3:37:58] <+MagiKestral> @prevot it told him to go to cataris, but not how
[3:38:05] <bobdoletrasher> @WoolieVersus read the briefing again
[3:38:09] <+superchronicc> @Prevot he probably did, he's trying to findd secrets
[3:38:50] <omnishadeee> i dont like the way the game phrases it makes it sound like theres an item or something to thaw stuff
[3:39:03] <pi_in_the_sci> And also the problem is in Catarsis
[3:39:09] <+PA_august> Yeah that seems like a bad translation
[3:39:09] <%Prevot> I didn't get that at all
[3:39:13] <BlackermanZX> X parasites being assholes again
[3:39:14] <+Rolandknight> he just need to go right
[3:39:27] <%Prevot> It sounds like the X are stopping you from getting an ability
[3:39:37] <%ekodrop> this is a map puzzle more than anything LUL
[3:39:42] <+superchronicc> woolie vs the elements
[3:40:31] <brachydios777> X are so much more worst than Metroids cause at least a Metroid can infect someone to learn how to fly a ship
[3:40:40] <brachydios777> *can‚Äôt
[3:40:59] <+MagiKestral> basically I ran around here with the block detector on for like 15 mins lol
[3:41:00] <iamnotaparrot> Chris Redfield could punch his way through every block type. tell him the X parasite is a biohazard and he'll solve it in under 24 hours
[3:41:07] <%Prevot> also metroid don't have a hive mind like X
[3:41:22] <+scwry> fyi it should only be ice missiles that make them explode
[3:41:32] <iamnotaparrot> also metroids are kinda cute and x are just flubber
[3:41:50] <omnishadeee> use scan pulse near that missile at the dead end on the left
[3:42:09] <%ekodrop> lol
[3:42:13] <brachydios777> It would be like if Xenomorphs landed on Earth or the Flood, we‚Äôd be screwed
[3:42:15] <gaminglink25> walls lie
[3:42:16] <bobdoletrasher> that missle has the answer
[3:42:20] <bobdoletrasher> ^
[3:42:29] <BlackermanZX> when in doubt missile everything or scan
[3:42:35] <SunsetJack> Who says you can't?
[3:42:41] <bobdoletrasher> @WoolieVersus yea just scan
[3:42:42] <gaminglink25> lying walls
[3:42:43] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1447814216103104512?t=FMN9Zf2S4JsthZvBIlfXDQ&s=19
[3:42:52] <omnishadeee> that 1 block gap at the missile looks kinda sus woolie ngl
[3:43:03] <%Prevot> I had already uncovered this path before the freezing happened
[3:43:20] <Darren716> DIffuse
[3:43:22] <+superchronicc> he's got it chat
[3:43:35] <@Menitta> oh god that suit is so clean
[3:43:49] <+thelovingfool> I think we all have PTSD from a hour of bomb jumps
[3:43:53] <Darren716> Honestly I prefer the varia in this game
[3:43:59] <Darren716> Gold red and white is just too clean
[3:44:06] <+thelovingfool> I don't like the orange
[3:44:15] <Darren716> It's not orange it's gold
[3:44:15] <@Menitta> the default is my favorite in this game
[3:44:19] <%Prevot> I really don't like this game's varia
[3:44:21] <+thelovingfool> ^
[3:44:24] <brachydios777> The orange fits with the red for me
[3:44:24] <omnishadeee> the game always has u on a kinda soft track so if u assume the game is always leading u in the right direction tis not that hard to get lost
[3:44:31] <+superchronicc> @Darren716 the white kinda clashes with the aesthetic a bit on the sleeves
[3:44:34] <+thelovingfool> default and grav is so clean
[3:44:46] <%Prevot> @menitta hope they keep blue as the basic power suit color from now on, way better than yellow
[3:44:55] <Darren716> See with  the grav I feel purple and the red clash a bit
[3:45:11] <@Menitta> I dont ever wanna see the power suit again
[3:45:13] <Darren716> LUL
[3:45:15] <Dave_VD> The Varia looks like a cool spin on her original colors but the purple just looks so tight. I like them all
[3:45:18] <rosemon5001> lol that felt like you were fighting an old man
[3:45:30] <@Menitta> default needs to be different now
[3:45:34] <Darren716> Know what suit I never liked?
[3:45:41] <Darren716> The final suit from Fusion
[3:45:45] <brachydios777> I also feel Zero Mission suit is underrated
[3:45:49] <+superchronicc> you should see soome of the concept art for samus in this game, she has really thick thighs in one of them
[3:45:49] <+thelovingfool> I feel that way for the normal grav suit
[3:45:58] <+thelovingfool> but white makes it good
[3:46:01] <+MagiKestral> go into the tiny hole at the top left of the room using bomb jumps or diagonal speedbooster for another fun sequence break
[3:46:02] <omnishadeee> i assume next default will also be different considering the explanation for this one is the suit is recovering
[3:46:08] <@Menitta> I like the Prime 1 Phazon suit
[3:46:09] <doggettxalex> I wish Parrying didn't disincentivize just shooting stuff so much.
[3:46:15] <@Menitta> the black with red trim
[3:46:19] <oneimportantthing> Woolie you don't have to kill every enemy lol
[3:46:19] <%Prevot> I saw the concept art and huh... they definitely chose the best design
[3:46:24] <%Namillus> When the game was announced I was dreading the usage of the Fusion colour schemes for the Varia and Grav suits but then the later trailer had the Varia suit in classic orange and I was relieved
[3:46:31] <SunsetJack> Lol
[3:46:33] <Dave_VD> Zero suit best suit Kreygasm
[3:46:33] <brachydios777> We can agree light suit os God tier though
[3:46:38] <iamnotaparrot> when you think about it, the self destruct at the end of metroid 1 is kind of one of the first "setpieces" in games
[3:46:40] <KasiCrafter> GAMER
[3:46:50] <+MagiKestral> keep going down this path for big prizes
[3:46:52] <BlackermanZX> light suit is sick af
[3:46:54] <@Menitta> I honestly dont care for the light suit as much as most people
[3:47:00] <+scwry> phazon suit tho
[3:47:05] <%Prevot> @menitta same
[3:47:09] <@Menitta> like it's cool but when I got it in Prime 2 I was underwhelmed
[3:47:24] <@Menitta> it's just a better Dark suit in that game
[3:47:26] <+MagiKestral> I could swear there's a breakable block around here somewhere
[3:47:32] <%Prevot> I also really dislike Dark Suit but it might be my distaste for Echoes showing
[3:47:40] <iamnotaparrot> I actually unritonically like the fusion suit and fusion gravity suit a lot. especially the way its sprite wiggles and moves
[3:47:42] <AzaroRequiem> man Woolie just takes a lot of time trying to get the parry on everyone, unironically would be faster if he just shot them on sight lmao
[3:47:53] <mothdude> Lava not coming out anymore
[3:47:56] <+ShutUpAceyP> or if he just ran past the enemies
[3:47:58] <dr_doriah> it's just hard to beat the classic color scheme. i used to have big qaulms with the fusion design but it's just so sick
[3:48:10] <Shad0wTag> @AzaroRequiem he likes doing the parry my guy
[3:48:13] <+VictorVonLouche> How is he still in this zone?
[3:48:23] <oneimportantthing> Woolie you can just tank through most enemies and run by them

[3:48:33] <+thelovingfool> tunnel is probably a loading zone
[3:48:37] <omnishadeee> @VictorVonLouche got stuck at missile block
[3:49:23] <@Menitta> its criminal that Samus never got any suits in Other M
[3:49:25] <+hrudzie_1> does woolie read chat anymore?
[3:49:36] <BlackermanZX> well soon you will be able to go a lot of places
[3:49:39] <SunsetJack> He doesn't want to get spoiled.

[3:50:07] <+Keaton_Corona> oh no
[3:50:08] <pi_in_the_sci> what below that room?
[3:50:17] <+hrudzie_1> why doesnt he just man em
[3:50:19] <Deasmeister> Game be like we dont have the budget to freeze everything so its railroad time
[3:50:22] <oneimportantthing> Oooooh this is gonna be good
[3:50:22] <+hrudzie_1> ban*
[3:50:43] <BlackermanZX> wow didnt notice it either
[3:50:53] <+superchronicc> @Deasmeister this game railroads you hard in the beginning
[3:50:54] <brachydios777> Now that I think about, the Chief and Samus are pretty similar huh? Family taken out of life, modified at a young age, fight multiple different Aliens and parasites, saved the galaxy multiple times, tall AF, usually stoic and not talkative
[3:51:25] <Darren716> Hehe chillin
[3:51:35] <Dave_VD> @brachydios777 you‚Äôve seen haloid right?
[3:51:38] <DedlokPM> @hrudzie_1 I mean, he tends to not try to during teh streams because they are going to be youtube videos and they will not have the context. Doesn't mean he is not going to, but he tries to limit it unless something particularly noteworthy occurs
[3:51:40] <Treasure_Vault> Both primarily coordinate with an ai
[3:51:40] <BlackermanZX> this is gonna be good
[3:51:42] <superchunk121> Hey everybody I just finished dis game. 9/10
[3:51:43] <Darren716> Hey woolie, you like phase shifts?
[3:51:43] <+ShutUpAceyP> go time
[3:51:45] <+thelovingfool> 2nd best boss let's go
[3:51:46] <%HollowedIdjit> OH THIS ONE
[3:51:48] <oneimportantthing> About to have one of the coolest sequences
[3:51:50] <brachydios777> @dave_vd Yep
[3:51:54] <%GeneralSCPatton> This one is a bastard
[3:51:55] <DoctorMulholland> This is a good one
[3:51:58] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> ever played Flappy Bird?
[3:51:59] <%HollowedIdjit> I came back at the right time
[3:52:00] <+MagiKestral> I did the quick kill on this guy and I loved it
[3:52:03] <+thelovingfool> fuckin love this boss
[3:52:05] <+VictorVonLouche> This is a super easy boss
[3:52:08] <oneimportantthing> This one is SUPER entertaining
[3:52:08] <$BallerSwagBro9k> ITS TIME
[3:52:09] <Carlioo> @MagiKestral the quick kill is sick
[3:52:12] <breadmeng> Cue the munster
[3:52:12] <heartlesshealer> it's time
[3:52:13] <Darren716> He fucked me up a few times when I tried spin jumping away
[3:52:14] <jawajedi> just did this boss last night. probably my favourite so far
[3:52:19] <+spawnzie> Really cool boss
[3:52:19] <Treasure_Vault> Mom?
[3:52:20] <gaminglink25> the parry is sick
[3:52:21] <%AlteisenReiseZ> I hope Woolie SHINES on this fight. It's a SHINING example of a good boss in Dread.
[3:52:25] <+scwry> Remember this thing on the operating table?
[3:52:30] <Blank9> gaping dragon
[3:52:32] <Tham1k> Boy is still mad
[3:52:32] <redwidow1358> OH FUCK
[3:52:33] <OldManDeckardCain> that's a alieeeen
[3:52:34] <Nocturnment> shin gojira
[3:52:38] <+kogathemaster> 0_0
[3:52:38] <dan_g_v> round 2
[3:52:39] <oneimportantthing> This boss is why the game is worth $60
[3:52:39] <%AlteisenReiseZ> What a SPARK of genius for Mercury Steam!
[3:52:42] <+VictorVonLouche> X parasite version now
[3:52:43] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> Corpius... 2!!
[3:52:43] <%RealThiele> its corpse boy from earlier
[3:52:55] <%Prevot> when coming here I thought it would be a Kraid rematch
[3:52:57] <+scwry> This one was being operated on in Dairon
[3:52:57] <pi_in_the_sci> wow, this arena is really long
[3:53:03] <Crimson_Aether> Is that Biolante?!
[3:53:06] <oneimportantthing> Amazing design
[3:53:14] <oneimportantthing> Saliva
[3:53:19] <$BallerSwagBro9k> MEGAMAN BOSS
[3:53:19] <brachydios777> He pissed
[3:53:32] <pi_in_the_sci> a parry
[3:53:33] <+scwry> this is the Diggernaut 2.0
[3:53:38] <%RealThiele> RIP
[3:53:44] <OfficerMods> no one gets that parry the first time
[3:53:45] <OfficerMods> its so dirty
[3:53:46] <BlackermanZX> the parry on that one is so damn sick
[3:53:53] <+spawnzie> it's a GOOD one
[3:53:57] <sirjames079> Forever amusing to me that they just straight up took the shine spark from Getter Robo for Metroid
[3:54:11] <brachydios777> No one gets it first try
[3:54:17] <oneimportantthing> This boss is so sick
[3:54:41] <schoolisforwinners> Woolie let those storm missiles marinate a bit
[3:54:41] <bobdoletrasher> @WoolieVersus you can lock on like 5 times
[3:54:51] <oneimportantthing> Space jump above the laser
[3:54:54] <+VictorVonLouche> Just double jump come on
[3:54:57] <TheHotStuven> 69 nice
[3:55:04] <$NitronStreams> Aw man
[3:55:05] <+scwry> chat he'll learn
[3:55:09] <+scwry> dont need to tell him
[3:55:10] <%RealThiele> pepto'ed
[3:55:23] <@Menitta> Yall are impatient
[3:55:24] <%Deft_Thought> Hey folks? Woolie Will Figure It Out.
[3:55:27] <oneimportantthing> True, he'll... figure it out
[3:55:32] <BlackermanZX> pee break time
[3:55:32] <%ZweihanderSteve> everyone take a break! do stretches and drink some aqua
[3:55:37] <%Deft_Thought> woolieMIRIN
[3:55:42] <%RealThiele> hydrate and potassium
[3:55:48] <$NIFtv> o
[3:55:52] <+scwry> all the bosses in this game are designed to be tried multiple times to learn them
[3:55:54] <+VictorVonLouche> Or just do another endless loop for an hour getting no where again
[3:56:10] <%LastHazzerd> SourPls
[3:56:12] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @AugiJr
[3:56:29] <@Menitta> Nothing wrong with taking time
[3:56:39] <+AugiJr> "Strimmer use my strats on the boss!!" HotPokket
[3:56:40] <%Deft_Thought> So? You in a hurry?
[3:56:44] <+Clarrynet> Is this a freakin remix of boyahbase and humming the bassline?

[3:56:56] <+samuraicaveman> vineKermiepls
[3:57:08] <Shad0wTag> @VictorVonLouche Dude Woolie is hype for the game, he's gonna figure out stuff while he plays
[3:57:20] <emMmDeeKay> after this, it's the best metroid in the series
[3:57:21] <@Menitta> Also I find at least in the early game, there are way too many progression required blocks that are hidden
[3:57:22] <+Neoepochx> One month left until SMT V
[3:57:34] <%fetrigon> @neoepochx KomodoHype
[3:57:35] <+Neoepochx> So ready
[3:57:36] <+gridib> limesDance limesDance limesDance
[3:57:37] <@Menitta> I got stuck like 3 times with that
[3:57:42] <OfficerMods> SMT V is going to be so goddamn long
[3:57:47] <+thelovingfool> this is easily the 2nd best boss in the game, but boy he takes time to learn
[3:57:48] <%ZweihanderSteve> @neoepochx fuuuug
[3:57:58] <+Neoepochx> I'd bet 50 hrs
[3:58:06] <%Seancicle> gotta jet. c u l8r Otaku üôèüèªü§üüèª

[3:58:43] <%ZweihanderSteve> woolieONEGUY
[3:58:45] <jorniev> they will fear this chozo's power
[3:58:46] <+VictorVonLouche> @thelovingfool Just jump and parry, this is the easiest boss.
[3:59:02] <+megaman_sentinel> i need more power
[3:59:03] <jorniev> UN tipo
[3:59:18] <omnishadeee> yeah thats meant to happen, beam is a distraction, parry is a bit early than its end
[3:59:19] <emMmDeeKay> Raven Beak reciting Edgar Alan Poe
[3:59:23] <brachydios777> Bosses aren‚Äôt easy in this
[3:59:37] <%KiwamiKiryu> Uno muchacho
[3:59:41] <DedlokPM> @VictorVonLouche If you want to dictate the playing of the game so much why don't you just go play the game yourself
[3:59:45] <oneimportantthing> This boss is a SPECTACLE
[3:59:48] <fairore> @thelovingfool nah the under water boss is the easiest boss
[3:59:54] <OfficerMods> after running this game a few times i think the bosses are easy once you know the pattern
[4:00:06] <pixelkingu> maaan, i know we are saying it a lot but...what an amazing game this is...
[4:00:06] <brachydios777> He doing it
[4:00:08] <omnishadeee> @DedlokPM he is only trying to help no need to be an ass
[4:00:14] <+thelovingfool> ... what? I said nothing about easiest
[4:00:18] <%Prevot> looking at these bosses now I feel like they do a good job training you for the final boss
[4:00:19] <emMmDeeKay> Will Woolie get the Parry? find out now
[4:00:27] <faeron93> Dude hits hard
[4:00:28] <+thelovingfool> I said he was the 2nd best
[4:00:31] <OfficerMods> and before you say something like "ugh but thats any video game boss" no some bosses even if you know exactly what they will do are still hard to impossible to avoid damage
[4:00:32] <@Menitta> God the later bosses do so much damage
[4:00:34] <pi_in_the_sci> you keep dodging into the swipes, just jump
[4:00:34] <brachydios777> That‚Äôs alot of damage
[4:00:38] <BlackermanZX> this boss is no joke
[4:00:41] <emMmDeeKay> shoot him
[4:00:42] <fistynopunches> this boss punishes you
[4:00:45] <%ZweihanderSteve> damn it looked like you had it wooliePOYO
[4:00:53] <+spawnzie> hmmm shine attack you say?
[4:00:53] <+VictorVonLouche> @DedlokPM Already beat it, lol. The readability on these fights is easy. For one I don't see why everyone is so obsessed with the storm rockets. So many bosses its worthless against.
[4:00:54] <jorniev> i just saw someone posting that parry... holy shit is samus cool
[4:00:57] <brachydios777> Trial and error
[4:00:58] <+thelovingfool> you have time for 3 misskes
[4:00:59] <@Menitta> Just dont get hit and shoot it LUL
[4:01:10] <%Prevot> @officermods that little bug boss was like that, simple moves but so fucking fast and strong
[4:01:11] <+gridib> This boss took me quite a few tries to beat, but it's such a good boss fight
[4:01:11] <+vaderxyz1970> Whats with this beam of ice thats its spewing
[4:01:20] <+scwry> this boss is the ability check
[4:01:23] <DedlokPM> @DedlokPM No he is not :just trying to help". He is being critical and diticacting of how to play and saying his way of play is the only right way
[4:01:29] <omnishadeee> @DedlokPM they are good for safety for players that want to focus more on dodging but yeah normal missiles are stronger
[4:01:33] <DedlokPM> @DedlokPM then beat it again
[4:01:37] <+spawnzie> YEYEYEYE
[4:01:39] <+ReallyBigRocks> YO
[4:01:39] <+Rolandknight> it's funny you can kill this boss 2nd phase in one hit with a shine spark.
[4:01:39] <OfficerMods> @prevot which is why i instakill him every time :)
[4:01:40] <BlackermanZX> YEYEYEYE
[4:01:41] <$NitronStreams> FUCKING SICK
[4:01:46] <+ReallyBigRocks> FUCKIN KILL EM

[4:02:10] <+kewlmyc> that was dope as fuck. Also, final boss?
[4:02:15] <oneimportantthing> YOOOO
[4:02:17] <Halospaz117> Zero Suit? Whatever. THAT's the real hot shit
[4:02:17] <%Prevot> lol no
[4:02:20] <Shad0wTag> take that clip and add take you for a ride
[4:02:22] <+MagiKestral> @kewlmyc not even close
[4:02:24] <brachydios777> @kewlmyc Nope
[4:02:25] <%Dr00_PhD> @kewlmyc nope
[4:02:25] <TenguGemini> God I love this boss
[4:02:31] <DedlokPM> @DedlokPM Not really reaching when you can see it in the text and how it is being said
[4:02:31] <+Rekinsinn> Yeah the actual execution of avoiding damage isn't high, it's about paying enough attention to the tells and not getting too distracted trying to shoot the boss
[4:02:40] <+kewlmyc> gotcha, thanks\
[4:02:40] <%townzzzzz> yooooooooo
[4:02:44] <%ZweihanderSteve> eat zee missiles, EAT ZEM

[4:02:52] <jorniev> this is the real QUICK TIME EVENT i always wanted in games
[4:02:52] <Dave_VD> The final boss has got to be birdgil

[4:03:44] <emMmDeeKay> Flappy Bird
[4:03:46] <3Xgilly> I love how this boss does a "wtf bro" scream
[4:03:46] <+kewlmyc> RIP
[4:03:47] <faeron93> That phase 2 is no joke!
[4:03:47] <$NitronStreams> Damn it
[4:03:49] <%ZweihanderSteve> wow
[4:03:52] <%Savatewolf> I forgot to Storm Missile him when I fought him
[4:03:54] <%LastHazzerd> that's some get good shit
[4:03:54] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:03:55] <$BallerSwagBro9k> X SLICER
[4:03:55] <OfficerMods> you WILL learn how to space jump properly
[4:03:56] <+MagiKestral> you CAN get a shinespark off
[4:03:57] <+kewlmyc> Gotta get good at Flappy Bird
[4:03:57] <jorniev> can you shoot it on the air?
[4:04:00] <pi_in_the_sci> the shift doesn't help
[4:04:03] <+thelovingfool> that attack great
[4:04:03] <%fetrigon> that sure is a phase 2
[4:04:03] <%Prevot> I feel like shift is gonna be way worse
[4:04:04] <brachydios777> Tricky
[4:04:06] <%ZweihanderSteve> that looks hard
[4:04:09] <OBS_VinnieK> that seems like he is begging you to shinespark him
[4:04:11] <+keiji_maede> that second part with the fans.... Aids
[4:04:20] <Dova573> Man i fucking love Micro missiles
[4:04:21] <+thelovingfool> it has a rythem
[4:04:42] <DoctorMulholland> There's  a cool trick I saw here where you can shinespark the boss while the fan's going. Seems hard to pull off with all the projectiles but it was neat.
[4:04:50] <schoolisforwinners> One volley of micro missiles does less damage than just shooting missiles normally
[4:04:59] <+AugiJr> Not gonna lie, 1 storm missle at a time is messin with me.
[4:05:01] <Dova573> Then only thing missing from them is that they dont apply freeze
[4:05:05] <emMmDeeKay> Doesn't matter
[4:05:08] <CrazyMedicine> i loved that
[4:05:12] <mothdude> Yeah going for single storm missiles instead of 3 or 4 is hurting
[4:05:12] <OfficerMods> well it sjust like elctro bug there is a very small window before his hit box goes away
[4:05:14] <omnishadeee> @schoolisforwinners nah they do a tiny bit more but ur wasting more missiles and takes longer to charge up for
[4:05:22] <OfficerMods> you CAN maintain speed and wait for a longer window
[4:05:34] <OfficerMods> but that's argueably harder
[4:06:21] <%Prevot> man when I did it ai kept fucking up the storm missile bit
[4:06:23] <+scwry> oof
[4:06:27] <hassanico2> Should never land during that
[4:06:28] <BlackermanZX> its a hard one for sure
[4:06:30] <+HakureiIllusion> Speed boosting makes it harder
[4:06:34] <OfficerMods> just missed
[4:06:35] <%AlteisenReiseZ> SO CLOSE
[4:06:38] <OfficerMods> JUUUUST missed
[4:06:39] <hassanico2> That wind thing is better space jumped
[4:06:43] <@Menitta> Damn
[4:06:44] <%fetrigon> nah
[4:06:44] <omnishadeee> storm missiles arent worth it if ur not getting 3-4 locks
[4:06:45] <Treasure_Vault> Is it?
[4:06:47] <+spawnzie> it does tho
[4:06:48] <pi_in_the_sci> His main body is in the background when he's swiping
[4:06:49] <dan_g_v> thats the moment you spark?
[4:06:50] <brachydios777> Damn
[4:06:50] <+HakureiIllusion> And definitely land near the end, the second-to-last one with the single open space is always heighted for a full jump from the ground
[4:06:51] <+minibarfs_> NO DUDE ITS SUPER COOL
[4:06:52] <%MegadBlitz> that shine might just be for style points
[4:06:53] <KasiCrafter> How much damage does a shine do, anyhow?
[4:06:54] <Treasure_Vault> You missed the spark
[4:06:57] <+MagiKestral> the shine will hit if you attack BEFORE he does the arm swings
[4:06:58] <pi_in_the_sci> but it works the rest of the time
[4:07:01] <Treasure_Vault> Uhh, it does
[4:07:01] <%AlteisenReiseZ> TRUST ME, TRY IT AGAIN
[4:07:01] <%LastHazzerd> guess he's gonna give up on the shine, chat Kappa
[4:07:02] <OfficerMods> its an insta kill woolie
[4:07:03] <+thelovingfool> it does
[4:07:04] <omnishadeee> @KasiCrafter instakills this boss
[4:07:05] <Treasure_Vault> it takes a fuckton of damage on the hit
[4:07:13] <brachydios777> It‚Äôs an instant kill!?
[4:07:13] <%ZweihanderSteve> i would be so frustrated with this. i suck at 2D action woolieKICKDAD
[4:07:16] <+MagiKestral> you can't hit him when he's swiping but if you hit him before it hurts
[4:07:22] <omnishadeee> @brachydios777 only for this dude
[4:07:23] <OfficerMods> shine spark always insta kills when it connects
[4:07:24] <BlackermanZX> a whole lot but its hard af to do
[4:07:38] <brachydios777> @omnishadeee That‚Äôs what I mean
[4:07:49] <%LastHazzerd> woolieYE
[4:07:59] <omnishadeee> yeah but other bosses u can shinespark its not instakill unfortunately
[4:08:06] <OfficerMods> like?
[4:08:18] <omnishadeee> the bug he got storm missiles from
[4:08:20] <@Menitta> God that is SO MUCH like Raiden on the Ray at the beginning of Revengeance
[4:08:24] <OfficerMods> no thats instant
[4:08:30] <omnishadeee> nah not instant
[4:08:32] <@Menitta> it's so cool
[4:08:35] <omnishadeee> does most of his health tho
[4:08:39] <+thelovingfool> rules of natuuuure
[4:08:40] <Nocturnment> wait shinespark hurts the boss? I tried it and took damage when I came in contact with it
[4:08:42] <%LastHazzerd> Rules of Nature would go good here
[4:08:48] <+Neoepochx> Is Storm missle more DPS than missile spam?
[4:09:04] <emMmDeeKay> if you connect all 5 locks
[4:09:12] <heartlesshealer> depends on how good you are at aiming
[4:09:13] <TenguGemini> storm missile only does more DPS if you get like three or more lockons
[4:09:15] <omnishadeee> u can shinespark that red chozo guy with the shield woolie thought earlier and its not instakill
[4:09:28] <+Slattsquatch> A single Storm Missile lock is less than just using a regular missile
[4:09:29] <+scwry> just running into them lmao
[4:09:30] <%Prevot> geez woolie
[4:09:32] <+Rolandknight> does he not have space jump?
[4:09:32] <BlackermanZX> fuck almost
[4:09:45] <+ShutUpAceyP> he's trying to do the shinespark early
[4:09:47] <%ZweihanderSteve> its minor, but i really like the micro thrusts on samus's back when landing after the parry PogChamp
[4:09:48] <bobdoletrasher> @WoolieVersus lock on more than once
[4:09:49] <%Prevot> it's just jumping
[4:09:50] <+VictorVonLouche> dead
[4:09:53] <+D00msDayDan> storm missile makes it really easy to focus on dodging attacks while still being able to attack
[4:09:57] <emMmDeeKay> welp
[4:10:00] <Treasure_Vault> It's the three highs that get him
[4:10:01] <BlackermanZX> yeah you just gotta jump in that phase
[4:10:03] <+thelovingfool> got to moon jump
[4:10:05] <+NeonNobleKalzeria> why no space jump
[4:10:05] <+scwry> speedboost will fuck you
[4:10:05] <TioXyco> gotta flappy bird the lava thingies
[4:10:06] <heartlesshealer> woolie is in intuition mode, so that's why he's forgetting space jump during the wide shots
[4:10:14] <+Neoepochx> What is he trying to do?
[4:10:14] <gaminglink25> just jump
[4:10:16] <Treasure_Vault> The triple high beam attack gets him every time
[4:10:18] <SunsetJack> Is the pattern fix?
[4:10:20] <omnishadeee> if u get hit u dont lose shinespark charge, so u can charge between hits, tank a hit, then shinespark after
[4:10:20] <+Neoepochx> shine spark into him?
[4:10:21] <@Menitta> Does jumping stop the startup for the boost?
[4:10:22] <%fetrigon> ya gotta play flappy bird woolie
[4:10:25] <TioXyco> @Neoepochx insta kill
[4:10:25] <+Keaton_Corona> pattern is fixed
[4:10:36] <BlackermanZX> in fact just space jumping is better than staying in the ground
[4:10:37] <+Keaton_Corona> jump 5 times then boost
[4:10:44] <+thelovingfool> it's the same Everytime, yeah
[4:10:50] <OfficerMods> low high low high middle i think is the order of the plasama
[4:10:50] <omnishadeee> the flappy bird boss
[4:10:54] <%jinking79> he's gonna land it now
[4:10:54] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1447814216103104512?t=FMN9Zf2S4JsthZvBIlfXDQ&s=19
[4:11:26] <%LastHazzerd> RULES OF NATURE
[4:11:34] <Dova573> man is super satisfying getting all the missile locks and unloading that shit
[4:11:44] <heartlesshealer> I like how it's actually using some of your missiles during that. Fun touch
[4:12:07] <oneimportantthing> It's better to keep spacejumping through that whole sequence, jumping off the ground takes longer
[4:12:17] <%ZweihanderSteve> IKUZE
[4:12:23] <DoctorMulholland> alright let's GOOOOO
[4:12:29] <Dova573> is because he is using the missiles is not just a cutscene
[4:12:31] <BlackermanZX> perfect
[4:12:40] <OfficerMods> aiiiir ball
[4:12:41] <@Menitta> AW
[4:12:43] <+VictorVonLouche> missed the diagonal
[4:12:44] <OfficerMods> aiiiiiiir ball
[4:12:46] <DevinMayCry> @oneimportantthing Nah the height of a jump and double jump are perfect for it though so its easier to dodge as long as you see them quick
[4:12:51] <pi_in_the_sci> wait for the roar to use it
[4:13:10] <+scwry> oh no
[4:13:11] <+VictorVonLouche> super dead lol
[4:13:16] <emMmDeeKay> RIP
[4:13:20] <bobdoletrasher> why dont you hold the missiles while jumping away to lock on even more
[4:13:22] <%ZweihanderSteve> ITS FINE
[4:13:27] <+scwry> speedbooster is killing you
[4:13:27] <%ZweihanderSteve> not fine D:
[4:13:28] <emMmDeeKay> Told ya
[4:13:31] <@Menitta> Aw
[4:13:33] <omnishadeee> u almost got it
[4:13:33] <BlackermanZX> so close
[4:13:34] <%LastHazzerd> more chances to do the shine hit
[4:13:35] <iamnotaparrot> flappy bird huh
[4:13:37] <brachydios777> Close
[4:13:52] <pi_in_the_sci> you need to wait for a roar
[4:13:58] <omnishadeee> when the boss is attacking with claws hes in the "backgroudn" u cant hit him
[4:14:00] <+itslapdog> lock on multiple times, its faster
[4:14:14] <jorniev> activate the SHINE
[4:14:21] <emMmDeeKay> It would be nice if Predictions where happening. Kappa
[4:14:41] <+Keaton_Corona> boss head is always the same spot after flappy bird
[4:15:08] <+Keaton_Corona> start charging after the 5th jump for some i
[4:15:10] <An_Armed_Bear> ugh this boss
[4:15:20] <+Keaton_Corona> shine* in time
[4:15:32] <bobdoletrasher> o yea you can charge the missles while running and dodging and then lock on with out L
[4:15:41] <+VictorVonLouche> grab the items
[4:15:45] <+kogathemaster> just do tget to greedy wool
[4:15:45] <%ZweihanderSteve> practice runs its fine SeemsGood
[4:16:10] <pi_in_the_sci> he does his swipes first
[4:16:15] <%fetrigon> wait why
[4:16:15] <+VictorVonLouche> Diagonal shinespark his face.
[4:16:18] <+MagiKestral> he always does swipes first
[4:16:18] <DopeCantaloupe420> "easy mode is now selectable"
[4:16:20] <centuronstar> You're getting there!
[4:16:21] <Treasure_Vault> Doesn't he swipe always?
[4:16:30] <%LastHazzerd> i assume it's when he's on the far right when he's panting, that's when ya hit?
[4:16:30] <brachydios777> Always swips after plasma
[4:16:31] <+NeonNobleKalzeria> spin jump won't activate
[4:16:38] <Treasure_Vault> You might be able to hit him before the swipe, he's invuln during
[4:16:40] <%LastHazzerd> or is that too far back?
[4:16:44] <+MagiKestral> I hit him with the spark right before he does the swipes cause he always takes a breather there
[4:16:49] <omnishadeee> u can jump but ur not gonna keep charge long enough
[4:16:51] <DevinMayCry> Y and B mid air is the shinespark activation when jumping right?
[4:16:51] <+spawnzie> he is damageable before the swipe
[4:17:03] <+thelovingfool> you may be able to wall jump to keep the run going
[4:17:06] <+alphonseisbest> JUST GOT here, did i miss woolie beating the game?
[4:17:19] <+thelovingfool> nah
[4:17:23] <+alphonseisbest> nice
[4:17:31] <+Tucker0603> is this the final big bad?
[4:17:35] <schoolisforwinners> No
[4:17:37] <DevinMayCry> @Tucker0603 Nah
[4:17:37] <Dave_VD> God that little dash move is so stylish
[4:17:38] <%Prevot> nope
[4:17:39] <emMmDeeKay> nope
[4:17:39] <An_Armed_Bear> hate how this boss can just decide to become invincible
[4:17:40] <brachydios777> @tucker0603 Nope

[4:18:42] <+kogathemaster> nice
[4:19:05] <TheHotStuven> gotta be faster to start it up?
[4:19:06] <emMmDeeKay> @devinmaycry Ha! You ain't seen nothing yet
[4:19:25] <DevinMayCry> @emMmDeeKay Oh Im well aware :eyes:
[4:19:34] <%LastHazzerd> is he hit able when he's panting on the far right of the screen?
[4:19:37] <bobdoletrasher> @WoolieVersus after lockon you can just run and shoot the missles, you dont need to aim them
[4:19:38] <+scwry> monkaS
[4:19:43] <BlackermanZX> DAMN so close
[4:19:44] <+alphonseisbest> damn
[4:19:47] <DevinMayCry> @LastHazzerd Pretty sure
[4:19:48] <+FuqBoiSlim> HE ALMOST HAD IT
[4:19:48] <@Menitta> too late damn
[4:19:53] <emMmDeeKay> RIP
[4:19:55] <omnishadeee> if u dont shinespark him right at the end its gonna be too late
[4:19:56] <+Keaton_Corona> it's always slash after flappy bird
[4:19:56] <+spawnzie> waited too lang
[4:19:56] <%Prevot> oh yeah he was totally vulnerable before the slash
[4:19:57] <centuronstar> Damn it looks pretty tough
[4:19:59] <BlackermanZX> that brief moment before the swipe is the window
[4:20:00] <Darren716> Honestly I think the shine spark is greedy
[4:20:01] <DevinMayCry> ive not pulled it off myself just seen it
[4:20:04] <+Keaton_Corona> got have to start charging after the 5th jump
[4:20:10] <+mister___doctor> so whats the death counter at
[4:20:10] <+Flunkorg> Why is he trying to shine spark the boss? Does something special happen?
[4:20:14] <+scwry> shinespark is greed
[4:20:15] <emMmDeeKay> Stop trying to be cool
[4:20:16] <TheHotStuven> big damage
[4:20:18] <DevinMayCry> @Flunkorg Instantkill
[4:20:20] <+Keaton_Corona> @flunkorg  insta kill
[4:20:20] <Darren716> It's a ton of damage
[4:20:21] <@Menitta> No be cool
[4:20:37] <+spawnzie> be cool it's the only way
[4:20:42] <Darren716> Shit it's an insta?
[4:20:43] <oneimportantthing> You can be cool without the speed booster
[4:20:43] <Zundelle> even if it took you 5 times longer, wouldn't you want to be cool
[4:20:46] <An_Armed_Bear> woolie trying to win with shin shoryu
[4:20:50] <@Menitta> last time he tried to be cool he sequence broke
[4:20:51] <%xeros720> i mean, if it gets you past that flappy bird section, it'd be real good for hard mode
[4:20:55] <Darren716> I thought it was just a ton of damage
[4:21:04] <Tham1k> it is
[4:21:07] <DevinMayCry> Games got secret shit like that and the alt kraid kill if you sequence broke. Also this fights hard so im not convinced woolie is wasting his time doing it this way
[4:21:16] <omnishadeee> @Darren716 only an insta for this guy, just a ton of damage on any other bosses
[4:21:17] <emMmDeeKay> PowerUpL kzxMuitoReal PowerUpR
[4:21:20] <+Flunkorg> @Menitta yeah, I just saw that in the vod, to bad he didn't get it before Kraig
[4:21:23] <Darren716> ahh
[4:21:26] <+FuqBoiSlim> okay phase 2
[4:21:53] <Darren716> ahhh
[4:21:56] <Darren716> damn
[4:21:56] <+spawnzie> gotta be faster
[4:21:57] <bobdoletrasher> you never need free aim mode
[4:22:07] <+mister___doctor> Wait could that have actually worked!?
[4:22:09] <emMmDeeKay> Squid1 HypeSquawk Squid4
[4:22:12] <%fetrigon> gotta be faster
[4:22:16] <%LastHazzerd> in which case i don't think he's seeing him panting on the far right
[4:22:17] <An_Armed_Bear> do you charge it during that gap in the blasts?
[4:22:23] <%xeros720> looks like you need to be lucky about what attack it does after
[4:22:45] <emMmDeeKay> This is a DPS race
[4:22:45] <bobdoletrasher> the missles charge while running too, you dont need to hold L @WoolieVersus
[4:22:50] <omnishadeee> @An_Armed_Bear u can do it at the end like woolie does or during a gap after the 5th jump. u lose speedbooster when u get hit but not shinespark so u store early and tank the last hit
[4:22:56] <BurdRightsActivist> GIGA BOTCH
[4:22:57] <+scwry> @bobdoletrasher he knows
[4:22:58] <+MagiKestral> you can activate speedboost in the air by pressing attack and jump at the same time
[4:23:00] <%xeros720> well, the missiles will charge if you hold R
[4:23:00] <BlackermanZX> gawd damn its getting close
[4:23:09] <+kewlmyc> Game seems super hard
[4:23:11] <+spawnzie> he wasnt invincible
[4:23:25] <BlackermanZX> i think you have to maintain the boost on the entire flappy bird section
[4:23:25] <omnishadeee> to be fair woolie, this is the secret instakill method. u could also just do the fight normally
[4:23:26] <%xeros720> woolie is just getting real close
[4:23:34] <DevinMayCry> @kewlmyc Game actually is which I love with how the checkpoints are
[4:23:41] <+Flunkorg> @kewlmyc His making it harder by going for style points. Normal kill is much easier first few times through.
[4:23:55] <DevinMayCry> The fights in this remind me of hollowknight often in a good way
[4:24:06] <@Menitta> He could totally beat it no problem without going for the spark
[4:24:12] <@Menitta> but fuck that
[4:24:20] <BlackermanZX> ^^
[4:24:22] <TheHotStuven> no spark = no glory
[4:24:23] <+alphonseisbest> STYLE OVER ALL----FACTS
[4:24:25] <An_Armed_Bear> I found super missiles did more damage than lockons but maybe that's placebo
[4:24:25] <DevinMayCry> This boss is hard either way. Like woolie getting his an extra time is all trying to spark here
[4:24:41] <BlackermanZX> clean phase 1
[4:24:41] <doggettxalex> if you don't get a SS do you even actually beat the boss
[4:24:42] <Wahrow> I love this boss' design
[4:24:44] <+HakureiIllusion> Full health phase 2
[4:24:52] <+scwry> its hard but woolie could crush it without spark
[4:24:55] <emMmDeeKay> He's Starting to Believe! PowerUpL kzxMuitoReal PowerUpR
[4:25:04] <pixelkingu> you can do it woolieee
[4:25:04] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:25:13] <+HakureiIllusion> I think you're shining under him
[4:25:16] <%xeros720> yeah, you can't disrespect its swipes
[4:25:19] <+Keaton_Corona> started charging waaaaay too late
[4:25:22] <KasiCrafter> He's untargetable when he's swiping
[4:25:29] <brachydios777> Too slow
[4:25:37] <+spawnzie> you have to do it instantly
[4:25:42] <brachydios777> It‚Äôs hard, don‚Äôt worry
[4:25:47] <TheHotStuven> 4 hp and a dream
[4:25:48] <omnishadeee> flappy bird expert mode
[4:25:51] <emMmDeeKay> RIP again
[4:25:52] <oneimportantthing> Lmao woolie trying to be cool is costing him so much health
[4:25:54] <TheHotStuven> rip
[4:25:59] <%LastHazzerd> RIP the dream
[4:26:01] <+scwry> wise
[4:26:03] <+Flunkorg> @An_Armed_Bear placebo, speedrunners have already confirmed that SM is just busted good
[4:26:04] <+VictorVonLouche> thought woolie played fighting games, why so aggressive in the attack and not reading the opponent?
[4:26:10] <BlackermanZX> rip
[4:26:11] <+D00msDayDan> can you walljump in that arena?
[4:26:12] <omnishadeee> u can tank the final hit from the beam and start charging early
[4:26:12] <Treasure_Vault> Woolie should be cool, girls might be watching
[4:26:15] <$NIFtv> are you okay Woolie?
[4:26:16] <brachydios777> That‚Äôs fine
[4:26:21] <DevinMayCry> You are gonna have a hard time not doing that too
[4:26:25] <Wahrow> You came this far, you can't give up now!
[4:26:25] <%LastHazzerd> so it's not possible to hit him when he's recovering from the attack?
[4:26:26] <pixelkingu> dont be cool , be lame, thats how you win
[4:26:26] <+Huderga> this a super boss?
[4:26:30] <%asakura_ayase> doodOne doodOne doodOne
[4:26:30] <+alphonseisbest> Believe in the DREAM
[4:26:31] <%BisoromiBear> this is the run
[4:26:38] <mar_krow> You got this
[4:26:42] <brachydios777> Lame it out like cross Tekken
[4:26:46] <An_Armed_Bear> Gotta just win with low forward, not shin shoryuken
[4:26:51] <+thelovingfool> @huderga normal boss
[4:26:56] <bobdoletrasher> man, dont let go of the missles button when running
[4:27:00] <+Keaton_Corona> it's not preservation or anything you just have to start the charge earlier
[4:27:09] <emMmDeeKay> @huderga He's making it harder on himself trying to do a Spark dash into the boss
[4:27:15] <+scwry> @bobdoletrasher he isnt
[4:27:16] <emMmDeeKay> he already downloaded the boss
[4:27:19] <omnishadeee> yeah gotta click the stick ASAP
[4:27:19] <tmvct1> Shinespark preservation. Sounds like a condom ad
[4:27:23] <+Keaton_Corona> lol
[4:27:29] <bobdoletrasher> @bobdoletrasher why does his charge vanish then
[4:27:42] <%Prevot> no condom could ever resist a shinespark
[4:27:45] <+Keaton_Corona> it's 5 jumps then start the boost
[4:27:55] <+Keaton_Corona> nope
[4:27:57] <+scwry> NAILED IT
[4:27:58] <+shieldanvil> i'm gonna tell my kids this is flappy bird
[4:28:04] <%xeros720> oh right then, damn
[4:28:06] <@Menitta> NOOOO
[4:28:07] <Shwepie> @An_Armed_Bear Pretty sure Supers do more damage per missile spent but Storm is better DPS. For instance there's a thing late game that can be destroyed with 10 missiles (3 lock ons and 1 super) or 4 missiles (4 supers).
[4:28:10] <Kain5707> GAMER
[4:28:10] <+Atomic_ColliderSG> that was SO close
[4:28:11] <%LastHazzerd> so that timing is rather tight then
[4:28:12] <+Keaton_Corona> waited WAY too long to start it
[4:28:14] <+thelovingfool> so close
[4:28:14] <+spawnzie> JUST MISSD HIM
[4:28:21] <@Menitta> that timing is super tight
[4:28:25] <%xeros720> that was a different animation there, it actually canceled the last two waves of its beams
[4:28:25] <+Keaton_Corona> @atomic_collidersg it wasn't though, there was no chance of it hitting
[4:28:29] <+Take_2_shots> I don't think you can do the Shine and be safe with it, I think you do get hit with the last ring when it happens right.
[4:28:38] <+scwry> This is the one
[4:28:39] <oneimportantthing> Yooo
[4:28:41] <+Keaton_Corona> he has to start the charge 2 walls earlier to have a chance at it
[4:28:42] <brachydios777> You gotta be super fast to do that
[4:28:46] <oneimportantthing> That was BEAUTIFUL
[4:28:47] <%Prevot> woolie getting better at aiming, this is gonna help for the final boss
[4:28:52] <Carlioo> @An_Armed_Bear huh, didn't realise they are different missiles
[4:28:55] <+thelovingfool> tbf a insta kill is a good reward for nailing the timing
[4:28:56] <+scwry> I think this is it
[4:28:57] <+theDesender> baller
[4:29:01] <+Blue256> come oooon
[4:29:02] <R_Blaze> Triple SSS
[4:29:06] <BlackermanZX> that was perfect
[4:29:07] <pixelkingu> YEYEYEYEYe
[4:29:07] <+scwry> GOTTEM
[4:29:08] <TioXyco> @Take_2_shots nah, you can be safe. if you get hit you lose speed and the shine, if I'm not mistaken
[4:29:08] <DevinMayCry> Welp thats that
[4:29:12] <Tham1k> Gg
[4:29:15] <@Menitta> Nice

[4:29:16] <%LastHazzerd> Cutscene finish!
[4:29:18] <+kogathemaster> Lets go
[4:29:20] <brachydios777> Noice
[4:29:21] <+LazyAss24Seven> UGH UH UH UH
[4:29:22] <@Menitta> oh that's fucking cool
[4:29:25] <omnishadeee> 1 storm lockon (3 micromissiles) = 450 damage, 1 super missile = 400 damage
[4:29:28] <+Slattsquatch> PogChamp
[4:29:28] <HawkGoggles2> Going from counter to kill feels real good
[4:29:29] <DoctorMulholland> baaaaaaaaased
[4:29:30] <DevinMayCry> Thats right. Return to X like a bitch
[4:29:31] <penitentpendant> "Isaac sends his regards."
[4:29:33] <+TaurusOxford> MY UPGRADE
[4:29:33] <%LastHazzerd> ooooo, that X core got got
[4:29:34] <%xeros720> the slow walking forward shooting charge shots is so good
[4:29:35] <BlackermanZX> rip x ability
[4:29:38] <Shwepie> No pink vomit power up for you.
[4:29:39] <+Tucker0603> fuck that's rad
[4:29:42] <emMmDeeKay> YEYEYEYYEYEYEYE
[4:29:45] <oneimportantthing> YYYEEEEEEE
[4:29:45] <brachydios777> That‚Äôs a big ass X
[4:29:48] <Deasmeister> Ac back on
[4:29:52] <Inqy833> Well the X disappeared in lava, I'm sure we'll never see it again...
[4:29:54] <DevinMayCry> @Shwepie That would be it huh lol
[4:29:57] <TheHotStuven> Problem SOLVED
[4:30:01] <brachydios777> Insta kill is hard
[4:30:02] <+MagiKestral> do the shinespark on your Hard mode run, obv
[4:30:04] <BurdRightsActivist> @DoctorMulholland On what? based on what? finish your sentence, tell us what it's based on. Use your words
[4:30:05] <+Tucker0603> the movement in this game is just so sexy
[4:30:07] <@Menitta> god I ABSOLUTELY LOVE her charging the beam at her side
[4:30:07] <oneimportantthing> THAT FLIP
[4:30:10] <pixelkingu> dont be cool
[4:30:11] <@Menitta> ITS SO COOL
[4:30:20] <ExpressNode> Wait was he supposed to get something but he missed it?
[4:30:21] <brachydios777> Lame it out
[4:30:24] <%LastHazzerd> the player can't charge with the arm down, only samus is allowed that
[4:30:25] <+thelovingfool> leave it to the speed runners
[4:30:26] <%BisoromiBear> Samus is the cool thing
[4:30:26] <%AlastorThrice> Samus is so cool in this game - they did such a good job with the characterization
[4:30:38] <+Blue256> @ExpressNode way to 1 shot the boss but it's hard to pull off
[4:30:39] <BlackermanZX> no more ice yay
[4:31:00] <+MagiKestral> I like how all the enemies are back to their shitty pre-X forms, even if they're still X
[4:31:10] <TheHotStuven> We have officially left Chilly Waters
[4:31:13] <tmvct1> chat, he could be worse, he could delete his save and start over after someone tells him about the Kraid morph ball thingy
[4:31:14] <DevinMayCry> I tested to see if the lil bugs fly away when you are stealthed and I was happy to find out they dont indeed fly away when camoflauged
[4:31:16] <+Flunkorg> @AlastorThrice Its like they took metroid other m and did the polar opposite
[4:31:39] <superdude22> Hi kirby!
[4:31:49] <%LastHazzerd> Fuck the concept of needing to "protect" samus on her adventure
[4:31:59] <oneimportantthing> Metroid Dread will be a timeless game, just like Fusion
[4:32:09] <emMmDeeKay> Oh no he' going to leave
[4:32:09] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:32:15] <%Prevot> @tmvct1 oh God is this referencing something someone actually did?
[4:32:33] <tmvct1> @Prevot not yet, but you never know lol
[4:32:34] <DevinMayCry> @LastHazzerd Its not even that cause they try and make it real obvious snark from Samus later when she defies shit but its done so badly. Theres for sure a story with Adam being overprotective they could have done but they botched it hard
[4:32:40] <KasiCrafter> Also can do some lava shenanigans with the Gravity suit
[4:32:59] <emMmDeeKay> @oneimportantthing You misspelled Zero Mission
[4:33:02] <TheHotStuven> could have had that in early game LOL
[4:33:25] <%LastHazzerd> it's bad writing when the story tells you how you are supposed to interpret something despite it feeling like the opposite
[4:33:29] <+Flunkorg> @emMmDeeKay I played zero mission and it left me whelmed. Its good but not life changing
[4:34:05] <bobdoletrasher> the ball hole
[4:34:06] <redwidow1358> The point wasn't that ZM is great, but that Fusion isn't timeless
[4:34:11] <DevinMayCry> @LastHazzerd Im glad they had the balls to keep in "Any objection, lady?" in this game and try and reclaim it
[4:34:28] <%Namillus> That's from Fusion anyway
[4:34:30] <+Flunkorg> @LastHazzerd That fucking ridley custscene in other m is the worstr
[4:34:45] <DevinMayCry> It sure is
[4:34:46] <brachydios777> @flunkorg She killed him 3 times before
[4:34:55] <%LastHazzerd> I can respect them trying to keep the character they want in Adam to be
[4:35:01] <omnishadeee> spending 10 missiles to get 2 oh yeah
[4:35:08] <%LastHazzerd> him being an AI now does wonders for his character actually
[4:35:14] <+Flunkorg> @brachydios777 >ven if she didn't, she still wouldn't react that way lol
[4:35:40] <+alphonseisbest> @Flunkorg EH THAT one was fine, NOW the fuckin ADAM self sacrifice cutscene is FUCKIN TRASH and not my Samus
[4:35:42] <DevinMayCry> Like the worst scene in Other M is Samus tongue in cheek going ANY OBJECTIONS ADAM as she reactivates screwattack to no one cause its far too late to care
[4:35:46] <brachydios777> @flunkorg Other M is 3rd birthday levels almost
[4:35:59] <emMmDeeKay> Fusion is just 2D Other M
[4:36:06] <+alphonseisbest> yes
[4:36:08] <%LastHazzerd> 3rd birthday is the worst example
[4:36:08] <tmvct1> heresy
[4:36:10] <DevinMayCry> @brachydios777 Noiw thats a bit too far honestly. Like anyone who legit means this I dunno. Its such a power gap to me
[4:36:13] <%Namillus> Other M is Fusion but again and before Fusion
[4:36:15] <+Flunkorg> @emMmDeeKay ban this sick filth
[4:36:18] <+alphonseisbest> Fusion is also bad
[4:36:25] <%GeneralSCPatton> @emmmdeekay Fusion is incredible
[4:36:26] <DevinMayCry> Fusions great
[4:36:31] <oneimportantthing> I can't play any Wii game, the 480p makes me feel near sighted
[4:36:31] <tmvct1> Fusion deniers get the ban hammer
[4:36:31] <+alphonseisbest> LUL
[4:36:35] <+alphonseisbest> such cope
[4:36:35] <brachydios777> @devinmaycry Almost, but 3rd birthday still takes the cake
[4:36:40] <emMmDeeKay> Other M is a step by step remake of Fusion
[4:36:44] <%Prevot> if you shit talk fusion you're not allowed to be a metroid fan
[4:36:47] <@Menitta> I like Fusion
[4:36:47] <mothdude> Other M asked the bold question: What if Fusion was bad?
[4:36:49] <%LastHazzerd> Fusion is bad because of the railroading, at least you're not SUPPOSED to like the AI in that game
[4:36:58] <@Menitta> Not my favorite but I like it
[4:36:58] <emMmDeeKay> Linear as fuck
[4:37:01] <Dementedpenguin> I'm not a Metroid fan, so what I'm getting from this chat is that every Metroid game is both incredible and terrible. Kappa
[4:37:06] <oneimportantthing> Fusion is fuckin amazing
[4:37:07] <@Menitta> Yes
[4:37:08] <+alphonseisbest> yes Kappa
[4:37:15] <slatersev> Yes
[4:37:17] <DevinMayCry> Whats cool about fusion is when it moves off the rails a bit
[4:37:18] <emMmDeeKay> It was good if it was your first metroid, I guess
[4:37:18] <@Menitta> super metroid? awful
[4:37:18] <oneimportantthing> Other M is bizarrely sexist
[4:37:19] <slatersev> Besides Prime 1
[4:37:20] <%LastHazzerd> Correct Kappa
[4:37:21] <sirjames079> Fusion rules
[4:37:22] <tmvct1> lol
[4:37:22] <DevinMayCry> They should have done more with that
[4:37:22] <+eanscrale> after all these years, I still can't believe fusion is so divisive.
[4:37:25] <pi_in_the_sci> you're immune to lava now
[4:37:29] <+Flunkorg> @Dementedpenguin I'm probably the only one in chat that really likes corruption
[4:37:30] <slatersev> which is just incredible
[4:37:32] <+alphonseisbest> Prime 1 tho TRASH
[4:37:33] <%Prevot> did woolie forget? LUL
[4:37:34] <brachydios777> @oneimportantthing Heels in armor
[4:37:41] <DevinMayCry> Cause you are in these biomes and whats neat is when you blow your way or follow SA-X through the fucking walls torn down
[4:37:49] <oneimportantthing> @alphonseisbest Ratio + Prime 1 is sublime
[4:37:53] <+alphonseisbest> @Flunkorg ... the p**n tag or the ganre
[4:38:01] <+alphonseisbest> *genre
[4:38:06] <sirjames079> I played Prime 2 for the first time recently and for a game that's always seemed fairly divisive, I fucking loved it
[4:38:07] <tmvct1> first fusion is bad, now prime? What is this heretic chat?
[4:38:11] <+alphonseisbest> *game
[4:38:15] <%RealThiele> other M is an old japanese man trying to make a sensitive and strong woman and its all shit
[4:38:16] <DevinMayCry> Im so glad they arent giving up on action metroid too lol
[4:38:17] <%Prevot> Prime 2 sucks ass
[4:38:22] <@Menitta> I was gonna say with Dread out, I seem to see a lot more people say Fusion is their favorite
[4:38:22] <+Flunkorg> @alphonseisbest Prime 3: corruption
[4:38:26] <emMmDeeKay> I'm not saying fusion is bad
[4:38:27] <%RealThiele> prime 2 rocks get wrecked
[4:38:30] <%Prevot> one of the worst two worlds mechanics I've ever seen
[4:38:35] <redwidow1358> Prime 2 is good
[4:38:41] <emMmDeeKay> I'm sayig it isn't top 5
[4:38:45] <@Menitta> Prime 2 is good, it's just a step down from 1
[4:38:53] <+Flunkorg> Prime trilogy being 3 good games is magic to me.
[4:38:54] <tangowulf> Prime 2 has a very mediocre beginning but becomes great afterwards
[4:38:56] <+alphonseisbest> @Flunkorg see and here was me thinking u'd pick the brave answer LUL
[4:38:56] <slatersev> Prime 2 is tied with Dread for best story in a Metroid game
[4:38:58] <BurdRightsActivist> Good Prime is 2
[4:38:58] <brachydios777> Other M is the bottom definitely
[4:39:01] <%LastHazzerd> Fusion had the most polish, least jank, and most accassability of the 2D metroids... except for that one boss, you know the one
[4:39:08] <+VictorVonLouche> Why not try Kraids room?
[4:39:12] <%Prevot> @emmmdeekay there's only 5 games anyway
[4:39:12] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1447814216103104512?t=FMN9Zf2S4JsthZvBIlfXDQ&s=19
[4:39:13] <@Menitta> theres a lot of questionable design choices but they dont hamper the game too much
[4:39:14] <oneimportantthing> Other M is what happens when out of touch unmarried Japanese men try to make a girlboss
[4:39:17] <An_Armed_Bear> Prime Pinball #1
[4:39:18] <tmvct1> Fusion is my least favorite from the main line, which is still a HUGE POWER GAP away from anything close to `bad`
[4:39:28] <heartlesshealer> they make a boss for a giel
[4:39:30] <DevinMayCry> Samus in the manga has an okay line about her womanhood. Where she reveals shes a woman to some loser kid who didnt know and she likens herself to a mother and I think thats unironically alright how they do it, even if you dont believe me in text.
[4:39:30] <heartlesshealer> girl*
[4:39:31] <emMmDeeKay> @lasthazzerd Once again, you misspelled Zero Mission
[4:39:33] <BurdRightsActivist> @LastHazzerd I don't know, I've played it multiple times
[4:39:34] <@Menitta> now THATS correct. Pinball the best
[4:39:35] <+Atomic_ColliderSG> Man collecting stuff in the end game of every Metroid feels so bad all you ever get is worthless missile upgrades
[4:39:38] <+alphonseisbest> @LastHazzerd its also the MOST liner out of all the Metroids, other then Mother M
[4:39:57] <pi_in_the_sci> yah, all the lava rooms need scraping
[4:39:59] <%Namillus> Storm Missiles are so sick that more missile tanks are worth it
[4:40:00] <+alphonseisbest> nah SOTN is the best Metroid
[4:40:02] <TheHotStuven> @Atomic_ColliderSG you will need those extra missiles lol
[4:40:06] <DevinMayCry> This game is also a japanese man making a girlboss but it worked. The same man for 15 years tried to make this game.
[4:40:07] <%LastHazzerd> @alphonseisbest yeah, i mentioned it's accessibility Kappa
[4:40:09] <tangowulf> I like the aesthetic of Fusion the most. lots of color and detail that doesn't detract from the creepy atmosphere
[4:40:12] <DevinMayCry> SOTN isnt even the best castlevania
[4:40:15] <%Prevot> SOTN not even the best castlevania
[4:40:17] <sirjames079> Prime 2's characterisation of Samus is stellar, she's got great animations in that game. The Dark Samus fights especially show that
[4:40:17] <emMmDeeKay> @alphonseisbest definitely top 3 Castleroids
[4:40:19] <+Flunkorg> @DevinMayCry IIRC samus aran being a women isn't a secret. She's supposed to be highly respected by anyone who matters.
[4:40:22] <slatersev> A lava room in Metroid without the music from Prime 1 is trasg
[4:40:28] <sirjames079> I played Prime 3 but it was so long ago that I don't remember a thing from it
[4:40:38] <DevinMayCry> @Flunkorg It isnt that shes lied to him its that hes a dumb kid
[4:40:44] <+alphonseisbest> yup Kirby SSA best Castlevania
[4:40:45] <@Menitta> I really need to get to Prime 3 eventually
[4:40:47] <+Atomic_ColliderSG> @TheHotStuven No you really won't
[4:40:48] <+Flunkorg> @sirjames079 Its the one with the ULTRA MODE in it.
[4:41:01] <An_Armed_Bear> Fusion is good for the 300 decibel Ridley screams.
[4:41:03] <waffleandman> A game bring Linear is not vsd
[4:41:03] <%LastHazzerd> more firepower is good
[4:41:21] <%LastHazzerd> oh man, why WAS Ridley's audio so loud
[4:41:22] <%RealThiele> prime 3 powercells made me stop playing it, well that and the waggle
[4:41:36] <brachydios777> Nice
[4:41:42] <oneimportantthing> GameBoy Advance in general was so good, zoomers will never know the feeling when sick ass games kept pumping out in the early 00s
[4:41:44] <DevinMayCry> I was gonna defend the aiming but you probably mean like. The doors
[4:41:44] <heartlesshealer> to be heard through the GBA speakers
[4:41:53] <+alphonseisbest> I like how chat isn't even commenting on Wools just baiting each other into the worst metroids LUL
[4:41:56] <%RealThiele> @DevinMayCry ye
[4:42:01] <%Prevot> @realthiele bruh just love your hand it's not that hard
[4:42:01] <+alphonseisbest> @oneimportantthing THIS
[4:42:01] <Treasure_Vault> @oneimportantthing Zoomers will never know their pinkies fucking dying
[4:42:03] <heartlesshealer> well woolie's doing fine
[4:42:04] <mothdude> Prime 3 Powercells were super simple to get compared to fetch quests in Prime 1 and 2.
[4:42:06] <%Prevot> *move
[4:42:09] <+AnthraxJohnson> Sorry for asking chat if it‚Äôs a spoiler or not but does this game have the move where samus runs really, really fast?
[4:42:14] <+alphonseisbest> yup
[4:42:15] <DevinMayCry> I dont remember powercells at all
[4:42:20] <brachydios777> @anthraxjohnson Yes
[4:42:22] <+Flunkorg> @AnthraxJohnson yes
[4:42:31] <An_Armed_Bear> Did the power cells have hints? That was the fun part about the Artifacts and Sky Keys for me.
[4:42:36] <%LastHazzerd> yep, woolie already has it so no worries
[4:42:36] <+AnthraxJohnson> Sick. I always loved that move
[4:42:40] <gaminglink25> long way round
[4:42:43] <tangowulf> One thing I loved about Fusion was the way the enemies progressed as you played. There were the caterpillars that went into cacoons then hatched later, or the way the blue X's would chase you relentlessly until you got the varia suit, then they'd start running away in fear.
[4:42:45] <+Flunkorg> @An_Armed_Bear Some yes
[4:42:48] <oneimportantthing> In Other M she doesn't run fast, but she submits to the patriarchy at lightning speed
[4:43:00] <+alphonseisbest> did anyone clip Woolies reaction to the Purple and green suit?
[4:43:08] <DevinMayCry> Also the Deleter was Tony Stark
[4:43:11] <%RealThiele> power cells in prime 3 just had like an are has some iirc so you had to hall wug if you didnt the first time but it felt really unsatifying to do
[4:43:18] <emMmDeeKay> @oneimportantthing LUL LUL LUL
[4:43:19] <ExpressNode> I kind of like the seemless transition from room to room
[4:43:26] <BlackermanZX> now you can dip into the hot salsa with the gravity suit
[4:43:28] <oneimportantthing> Lmao I like how Woolie doesn't read chat, and chat isn't watching Woolie
[4:43:37] <%RealThiele> wool-who?
[4:43:40] <emMmDeeKay> psaDown
[4:43:40] <An_Armed_Bear> Enter the HOT ZONE
[4:43:43] <+alphonseisbest> right? its great
[4:43:53] <DevinMayCry> This is the metroid IRC isnt it?
[4:43:53] <SunsetJack> Power Cells were also tagged I think by the satellite that shows all items...?
[4:43:54] <tangowulf> @oneimportantthing It's just a friendly hangout
[4:43:55] <Dopamien> @oneimportantthing chat discorse is a good thing
[4:43:58] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> Imagine if going through a door in metroid caused an RE door opening cutscene every time you did it
[4:44:10] <pi_in_the_sci> those one way doors stay unlocked from both sides if you open them
[4:44:13] <DevinMayCry> Unironically should happen every emmi zone in this one
[4:44:15] <%Prevot> I'll pay more attention to the stream once he starts moving forward again LUL
[4:44:24] <An_Armed_Bear> I remember some doors in Prime 3 taking a loooong time to open.
[4:44:33] <%xeros720> the wii tried really hard
[4:44:42] <oneimportantthing> Prime 1 had no right having those amazing graphics
[4:44:46] <+VictorVonLouche> @Prevot Till the next stream by the looks of it LOL
[4:44:48] <+alphonseisbest> he just doing some good ol fashion wall hugging or WUGGING as the kids call it
[4:44:48] <%Prevot> 1 and 2 on GC also had some rough loads
[4:44:48] <oneimportantthing> For a 2002 game
[4:44:48] <brachydios777> Chat:‚Äùyou posted cringe! Gooood. Do it again.‚Äù
[4:44:56] <DevinMayCry> Fucking gamecube blast processing
[4:45:00] <An_Armed_Bear> And the entrance to the Impact Crater temple in Prime 1 always took awhile
[4:45:01] <tmvct1> cant get spoiled if you pretend chat isnt there
[4:45:07] <omnishadeee> interesting complaint i saw about this game (and samus returns) was the "antfarm" (blacked out walls) look of the game. i think itd be nice for more detail on them but imo its not that big an issue and helps visual clarity
[4:45:19] <+AnthraxJohnson> Did Luigi‚Äôs Mansion even have to load?
[4:45:27] <BurdRightsActivist> All that for a drop of missles
[4:45:30] <oneimportantthing> Did the Wii improve on GC's graphics whatsoever?
[4:45:30] <%RealThiele> yea artifacts in prime 1 were the worst part imo. some spinning ass polygons with so actual art
[4:45:32] <BlackermanZX> worth it
[4:45:37] <%xeros720> yeah, luigi's mansion did, but only stuff like, floor transitions
[4:45:47] <%xeros720> it loaded up a lot of nearby rooms into ram or something
[4:45:54] <heartlesshealer> visual clarity is more important when secrets are buried in every walls
[4:45:54] <%Prevot> @oneimportantthing not really
[4:46:03] <%Prevot> @oneimportantthing just way better controls
[4:46:07] <+AnthraxJohnson> @xeros720 yeah you‚Äôre right. I remember the door opening animations
[4:46:07] <DevinMayCry> I dunno your metroiud game should look like that I think
[4:46:12] <An_Armed_Bear> ...I did really like the fanfare when you get a Chozo Artifact in Prime 1 though.
[4:46:13] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:46:15] <+alphonseisbest> so is Samus the MOST powerful she's ever been here?
[4:46:26] <DevinMayCry> @alphonseisbest 100000%
[4:46:29] <brachydios777> @alphonseisbest Definitely
[4:46:30] <@Menitta> absolutely
[4:46:32] <%Prevot> titally
[4:46:34] <%fetrigon> ye
[4:46:36] <%RealThiele> @alphonseisbest id argue omega samus was slightly stronger but this one is quicker
[4:46:39] <%Namillus> Undeniably
[4:46:41] <DevinMayCry> Its a powergap how much stronger
[4:46:41] <%Prevot> unbelievably powerful
[4:46:42] <oneimportantthing> @alphonseisbest In the endgame of Dread Samus can basically walk through everything and kill them
[4:46:51] <ExpressNode> Its been so long since I played Luigi's Mansion (probably since launch) and I can't even say anything about that
[4:47:00] <BlackermanZX> fuckin finally
[4:47:03] <bobdoletrasher> new item ball
[4:47:04] <SunsetJack> That's progression for sure
[4:47:08] <+alphonseisbest> hehe cool, me like BIG STRONG LANDY
[4:47:09] <%xeros720> game yelling at you to progress
[4:47:09] <Shwepie> Good job.
[4:47:09] <BlackermanZX> tht  blue balling
[4:47:16] <KasiCrafter> But doesn't this need the Screw Attack?
[4:47:20] <%RealThiele> this game has plot?
[4:47:23] <%Prevot> dsamus goes from starting fusion at her weakest to ending dread at her strongest
[4:47:24] <%RealThiele> only pickups
[4:47:25] <oneimportantthing> Remember the graphics of F-Zero GX, hopefully Nintendo revives that too
[4:47:27] <brachydios777> @realthiele Yes
[4:47:40] <OfficerMods> this game does in fact have a lean plot but its more than enough to make an impact
[4:47:42] <DevinMayCry> I saw someone complaining that they made samus over sexualized in this one cause she "does a sexy strut" and I was like "wha?"
[4:47:48] <emMmDeeKay> You got the gravity suit
[4:47:50] <+thelovingfool> I think he forgot he was thawing out the first area
[4:47:53] <TheHotStuven> At the very end of the game, Metroid learns to crawl Kappa
[4:47:58] <brachydios777> @devinmaycry Huh?
[4:48:00] <Kain5707> Kappa
[4:48:00] <%RealThiele> @DevinMayCry Stupid, sexy strut
[4:48:09] <+MagiKestral> I would personally recommend grabbing whatever that item sphere was in the previous area
[4:48:12] <omnishadeee> lol
[4:48:13] <heartlesshealer> door now opened forever
[4:48:15] <+VictorVonLouche> oh look you found the screw attack
[4:48:16] <DoctorMulholland> well now
[4:48:20] <oneimportantthing> Lol I hope they add zero suit Samus DLC to this game
[4:48:21] <ExpressNode> Like a Bayonetta strut but with armor?
[4:48:22] <DoctorMulholland> and there it is
[4:48:23] <+NeonNobleKalzeria> power moves

[4:48:28] <bobdoletrasher> YEA
[4:48:29] <+D00msDayDan> game is now super easy
[4:48:30] <heartlesshealer> jump ball obtained <3
[4:48:31] <roughday25> ol' faithful
[4:48:31] <BlackermanZX> YEEA
[4:48:34] <DevinMayCry> Yeah like respect to Bayo but Samus isnt doing any of that in this
[4:48:35] <Tham1k> op attack
[4:48:38] <oneimportantthing> Time to become OMNI
[4:48:39] <+VictorVonLouche> just took a massive scenenic route first
[4:48:40] <%Charronia> gdqSpin
[4:48:41] <%RealThiele> limiter removed now
[4:48:41] <+LazyAss24Seven> now be the screw attack!
[4:48:42] <+Take_2_shots> It was me Screw Attack all along.
[4:48:45] <SethYuikora> space hump
[4:48:47] <$NitronStreams> HELL FUCKING YEAH
[4:48:53] <An_Armed_Bear> I love how broken the Screw Attack is in all the games and then in Smash it's a wet noodle
[4:48:53] <DevinMayCry> Might as well turnt he game off. Its over
[4:48:55] <ExpressNode> Oh so he can finally destroy those blue blocks
[4:48:55] <BurdRightsActivist> "Go to the endgame already sheesh" the powerup
[4:49:00] <+AnthraxJohnson> Screwattack top ten list nolstagia kicking in
[4:49:02] <Onjani> Time to just goomba stomp everything
[4:49:03] <TheHotStuven> time to give no fucks while backtracking
[4:49:03] <+samuraicaveman> hot take but I don't like the screw attack because it makes everything too easy and you get it too early in this game
[4:49:07] <DoctorMulholland> The "I don't have time for you peons" move.
[4:49:12] <emMmDeeKay> The Screw Attack where the friends we made along the way
[4:49:20] <heartlesshealer> and with the space jump too, so you feel the power right away
[4:49:21] <+Take_2_shots> Turn brain off go Bbzzz
[4:49:24] <+yamidemon666> at mode activate
[4:49:26] <SethYuikora> does charging your shot do anything special during SA?
[4:49:29] <emMmDeeKay> "With STUTTERING CRAIG!"
[4:49:31] <%fetrigon> just do whatever
[4:49:31] <+Atomic_ColliderSG> yes all 20 minutes of it
[4:49:37] <@Menitta> Prime didnt have this kind of screw attack right?
[4:49:40] <%Prevot> @samuraicaveman how the fuck is this too early lol
[4:49:45] <%OtakuSnake1> Infinite chaos dunk unlocked
[4:49:48] <+thelovingfool> it's funny how fast the game can end from here
[4:49:54] <$NitronStreams> With every spin Samus lets out a tiny "Ye"
[4:49:54] <DevinMayCry> Screw Attack was a glorified wall jump in prime
[4:49:57] <essence_of_lariatto> it was a linear screw attack
[4:49:59] <+samuraicaveman> @Prevot there's still a bunch of upgrades after this that feel pointless now
[4:50:02] <@Menitta> yeah it was a wall jump
[4:50:06] <An_Armed_Bear> Prime 2 and 3 have it but it's awkward
[4:50:11] <+FuqBoiSlim> didn't space jump only give you like 3‚Äê4 jumps in prime?
[4:50:12] <@Menitta> that's what I'm thinking of
[4:50:20] <An_Armed_Bear> Though it DOES do a ton of damage if you manage to hit something
[4:50:26] <%RealThiele> in prime 2 if you hit emperor ing with screw attack it does fuck him up
[4:50:36] <DevinMayCry> thats nice
[4:50:43] <BlackermanZX> screwattack melts the X
[4:50:54] <DevinMayCry> Honestly I hate how it feels htting some enemies
[4:50:58] <hewlettfan96> Please tell me it‚Äôs better than the last decade of Metroid games
[4:51:01] <An_Armed_Bear> I like how the second the X get out the planet is just done
[4:51:04] <+VictorVonLouche> Really triggering that he doesn't just grab that easy missile tank and be DONE with that corner
[4:51:09] <%RealThiele> low bar but yea dread leaps right over it
[4:51:12] <ExpressNode> I wonder if they will sell the trilogy before they sell 4 I mean most people probably have never touched those games, like myself
[4:51:15] <DevinMayCry> @hewlettfan96 This is arguably the greatest metroid ever made
[4:51:43] <An_Armed_Bear> It's missing one key thing for me but that's spoilery
[4:51:46] <TheHotStuven> No ice!
[4:52:01] <roughday25> god I love this gravity suit so much
[4:52:07] <hewlettfan96> @devinmaycry That‚Äôs a bold claim? Better than super Metroid, Metroid prime 3, and Fusion???
[4:52:08] <%RealThiele> i mean thats what end game metroid is about. getting those pickups
[4:52:10] <oneimportantthing> @devinmaycry After Fusion I'd say, but yeah
[4:52:17] <ExpressNode> I mean I have a gamecube but those games are prohibitively expensive
[4:52:22] <BlackermanZX> i mean its a good thing you can just explore like crazy
[4:52:26] <DevinMayCry> @hewlettfan96 I know right
[4:52:43] <@Menitta> Well if you have a Wii U you can- pffffffff
[4:52:47] <oneimportantthing> Imagine Nintendo commissions OTHER M TOO: THE BABYNING
[4:52:57] <+thelovingfool> u don't like Wii prime 1 cause it took out the early space jump glitch
[4:53:05] <DevinMayCry> I like how you list metroid prime 3 when we were mostly ribbing on it earlier though. Everyone got their own favorites but this is easily gonna be many peoples favorite of all time
[4:53:10] <+thelovingfool> I*
[4:53:15] <emMmDeeKay> Time to beat that last EMMI
[4:53:15] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:53:18] <An_Armed_Bear> Wonder why Nintendo won't just put the Trilogy out, it's the perfect time now.
[4:53:20] <+VictorVonLouche> He completely skipped that missile tank jfc.
[4:53:20] <@Menitta> That's a mark of a good series.
[4:53:26] <hewlettfan96> @devinmaycry Jesus really, what did they get so right???
[4:53:29] <@Menitta> Everyone has a different favorite
[4:53:31] <%RealThiele> yea like dread aint my favorite cause of how melee reliant it is but i know people love it and i wont hate
[4:53:36] <DevinMayCry> @hewlettfan96 You gotta feel the game first
[4:53:40] <ExpressNode> @Menitta I didn't even fuck with the Wii U. I can grab one off of Ebay for a good price but what's the point honestly most of the good games have been transferred off the system
[4:53:47] <hewlettfan96> I mean it does look fun af and I love the 2.5D look
[4:53:47] <DevinMayCry> Like it feels good to play and thats with analog platforming even
[4:53:49] <oneimportantthing> @an_armed_bear Nintendo tends to hate their own games from previous consoles. Best Regards, an F-Zero fan
[4:53:49] <%Prevot> no point releasing Prime Trilogy unless Prime 4 is close to releasing
[4:53:57] <%CAPSLOCKlive> We dreadin in here?
[4:54:09] <tmvct1> uh oh
[4:54:09] <DopeCantaloupe420> how
[4:54:10] <%xeros720> like trying to unlock your front door in complete darkness
[4:54:13] <TheHotStuven> closer?
[4:54:13] <Kain5707> this one is fucky
[4:54:16] <mothdude> what on earth?
[4:54:17] <@Menitta> That's already used
[4:54:19] <%LastHazzerd> that's.... not right
[4:54:19] <Deasmeister> ???
[4:54:20] <bobdoletrasher> huh
[4:54:23] <BlackermanZX> you have to hit the 3 of them?
[4:54:23] <%LastHazzerd> OH
[4:54:23] <Qsmash_> this one is really specific
[4:54:23] <bobdoletrasher> no
[4:54:25] <+NeonNobleKalzeria> not used yet
[4:54:25] <Agarciahunter> I think jump
[4:54:26] <@Menitta> Wait is it not?
[4:54:29] <pi_in_the_sci> no,it's just wierd
[4:54:30] <roughday25> neutral jump?
[4:54:34] <DopeCantaloupe420> gotta line it up and charge
[4:54:39] <%Prevot> charge wool
[4:54:42] <oneimportantthing> Perfect line
[4:54:42] <BlackermanZX> its not hitting the 3 of them
[4:54:48] <+VictorVonLouche> Woolie use the wall
[4:54:49] <+jbfelder> Bless his heart
[4:54:50] <%CAPSLOCKlive> I can see this one triggering some OCD's
[4:54:52] <+thelovingfool> on the wall
[4:54:52] <Deasmeister> QA strikes again
[4:54:58] <DopeCantaloupe420> it's not moved
[4:54:58] <pi_in_the_sci> nope
[4:54:59] <@Menitta> he was using the wall
[4:54:59] <BlackermanZX> no you didnt
[4:54:59] <+ReallyBigRocks> you gotta be aligned like Macho Man
[4:55:02] <KasiCrafter> You have not moved it
[4:55:03] <%RealThiele> no its being jank
[4:55:05] <TheHotStuven> it would say (Moved)
[4:55:06] <pi_in_the_sci> it would say (used)
[4:55:07] <+Jonesman64> Charge?
[4:55:07] <%xeros720> if it's activating at all you can do it
[4:55:10] <Agarciahunter> No
[4:55:10] <+Jonesman64> ah
[4:55:13] <An_Armed_Bear> QA powers
[4:55:13] <BlackermanZX> there ya go
[4:55:14] <@Menitta> there
[4:55:17] <+alphonseisbest> ayyyyyyyyy
[4:55:17] <%ekodrop> you did not
[4:55:19] <%Prevot> NotLikeThis
[4:55:24] <$NitronStreams> just stupid precision
[4:55:27] <heartlesshealer> I like how the beams didn't fill up all the way to show you to charge
[4:55:27] <%RealThiele> sequence break! (softlock)
[4:55:32] <tmvct1> game sucks 0 out of 10 IGN
[4:55:47] <bobdoletrasher> left?
[4:55:52] <@Menitta> guess there was no other block positioned like that
[4:55:52] <BlackermanZX> theres an entire area to the left btw
[4:55:54] <DoctorMulholland> Screw Attack turns it into METROID SHRED
[4:56:04] <@Menitta> they were all on a floor you could stand on
[4:56:15] <oneimportantthing> Gamespot: "exaggerated swagger of a space ranger"
[4:56:16] <Agarciahunter> Just joined I assume he is cleaning up secrets?
[4:56:16] <+rahunin> Adam?
[4:56:16] <DevinMayCry> @hewlettfan96 Small list of some awesome stuff in this game. Smooth heavy action gameplay, hard dificulty, good bosses, built inr ewards for sequence breaks, good new powers, one of the flatest parts of the game is the choice for more muted soundtrack
[4:56:25] <tmvct1> Screw Attack is always a victory lap, until the bosses
[4:56:39] <%RealThiele> hard but fair difficulty checkpoints are everywhere
[4:56:42] <@Menitta> I'm not a fan of the soundtrack tbh
[4:56:49] <omnishadeee> theres lot of intentional sequence breaks and unintentional ones. theres also a glitch that lets u shoot through walls nicknamed pseudowave
[4:56:50] <An_Armed_Bear> Idk for some reason most of the bosses didn't do it for me in this one.
[4:56:59] <DevinMayCry> The sound is fine. Its definitely a choice but I think there should have been more music
[4:57:02] <%Namillus> this one is sick
[4:57:06] <@Menitta> it works for the game but there are no memorable tracks
[4:57:09] <tmvct1> this one threw me for a loop
[4:57:10] <An_Armed_Bear> Like they're not bad, just didn't really stand out to me
[4:57:11] <$NitronStreams> Oh I seen this one
[4:57:12] <%xeros720> oh i like this one too, it's a bit fucky though
[4:57:14] <oneimportantthing> Half of this game is reading maps like Bilbo Baggins trying to get out of Hobbiton
[4:57:18] <BlackermanZX> oh this one has a trick
[4:57:21] <+thelovingfool> I have little live for most Metroid osts
[4:57:23] <%ekodrop> the real puzzle begins
[4:57:23] <%CAPSLOCKlive> ooooh Max lost a minute or two on this one
[4:57:34] <omnishadeee> time for the most rewarding bomb jump ever
[4:57:37] <%jinking79> shineball time
[4:57:38] <BlackermanZX> LUL
[4:57:39] <@Menitta> most of my love is on Prime 1 and 2's osts
[4:57:43] <AngryAsian5> LUL
[4:57:44] <+ReallyBigRocks> FIGHT IT
[4:57:49] <Darren716> Woolie there's a way cooler way to do this

[4:57:56] <%Charronia> Bomb jumping: the answer to every Metroid puzzle limesOk
[4:57:56] <+theDesender> pinball gameplay
[4:57:57] <roughday25> I believe

[4:58:02] <+ReallyBigRocks> fight with all your heart
[4:58:04] <Agarciahunter> Ball spark?

[4:59:50] <omnishadeee> its easy to see when uve already done it chat give him a break
[4:59:54] <+VictorVonLouche> How can this be?
[4:59:54] <miucsa51> I love this game
[4:59:55] <+spawnzie> yeah lol it's discolored

[5:00:08] <AngryAsian5> LUL
[5:00:08] <$NitronStreams> OOOOHH
[5:00:09] <Tham1k> I wonder what it is
[5:00:10] <+shootbang_exe> I got stuck on this one for a while this is normal
[5:00:11] <An_Armed_Bear> I was just spamming the scanner everywhere i guess
[5:00:14] <%xeros720> BUT BABA THO

[5:00:23] <+Slattsquatch> In fairness to Woolie I also didn't see the solution to this one for a while
[5:00:23] <+spawnzie> How can this BE
[5:00:27] <bobdoletrasher> you have a scanner
[5:00:27] <+insanestephen> I like the idea of getting an unknown resource and Samus just goes "neat."
[5:00:27] <BlackermanZX> theres a trick on one room
[5:00:32] <+thelovingfool> but baba ceases to beeeee
[5:00:35] <emMmDeeKay> psaHoldon psaHoldon psaHoldon

[5:00:52] <%ekodrop> y'all need to shush
[5:00:56] <Darren716> Did he get the C bomb yet?
[5:00:58] <redwidow1358> I wonder if Woolie will figure it out
[5:01:03] <heartlesshealer> oi no don't mention that
[5:01:09] <CupnCake> hold shinespark before jump yo
[5:01:21] <+Funky_Honkey> this isn't about figuring stuff out, this is about being attentive
[5:01:23] <+MagiKestral> you're missing something
[5:01:24] <%LastHazzerd> this genera really do bring out the backseating in full
[5:01:25] <Jnkolm> An unkown resource. So we know it could be ore, wheat, or maybe sheep
[5:01:27] <+Flunkorg> woolie might not figure it out lol
[5:01:28] <+VictorVonLouche> Oh no, oh no, paige is manifesting
[5:01:36] <heartlesshealer> anyone confused about where woolie is progress-wise, he just got screw attack after defeating the flappy bird boss
[5:01:38] <%RealThiele> but ball ba

[5:01:46] <@Menitta> I dont even see it
[5:01:53] <TheTakkster> Every time he's in that hallway my eyes lock onto it
[5:01:58] <DopeCantaloupe420> right end of the hall
[5:01:59] <+Funky_Honkey> does he have the scan pulse?
[5:01:59] <shotgang86> it can work
[5:02:02] <bobdoletrasher> @Menitta far right in the hall
[5:02:03] <%CAPSLOCKlive> Let it flow chat, let it be. Woolie got this.
[5:02:04] <DevinMayCry> He got screw attack. Games basically over
[5:02:06] <Agarciahunter> @menitta look right
[5:02:06] <+insanestephen> Woolie don't look at chat you can do this
[5:02:09] <+thelovingfool> @heartlesshealer he can go directly to the final area

[5:02:46] <$NitronStreams> Someone has to show him the Max clip after this stream
[5:02:49] <oneimportantthing> No need to shush, he's not reading chat anyway

[5:08:54] <heartlesshealer> he did it
[5:08:56] <tmvct1> he doesnt read anyway
[5:08:57] <oneimportantthing> That works too
[5:09:00] <+VictorVonLouche> 2 Emmis left actually
[5:09:03] <%RealThiele> he did it

[5:09:40] <SpookyMooks> no
[5:09:41] <bobdoletrasher> youre scanning wrongly @WoolieVersus
[5:09:47] <iamnotaparrot> speed booster?
[5:10:01] <%RealThiele> woolie has regular bombs only atm
[5:10:03] <%Prevot> oh he's back to this
[5:10:04] <+VictorVonLouche> He's like 2 minutes away from it but insists on finding all the items he cannot obtain first lol
[5:10:30] <iamnotaparrot> eh. if he's having fun I'm having fun
[5:10:45] <%CAPSLOCKlive> He is Figuring it Out (tm)
[5:10:46] <peachy996> its fine
[5:10:46] <Agarciahunter> @victorvonlouche while missing the ones he can
[5:10:49] <oneimportantthing> Woolie insists on getting items ahead of schedule (and the ability that'll make it easy)
[5:10:51] <%RealThiele> like this is half of metroid so i dont know what people were expecting
[5:10:53] <BlackermanZX> iirc its the thing hidden in those blocks
[5:10:54] <+thelovingfool> no fun only entertainment
[5:11:15] <oneimportantthing> Woolie Could Possibly Figure It Out
[5:11:16] <+ShutUpAceyP> is he going for 100%?
[5:11:23] <+ReallyBigRocks> simply do the thing Woolie
[5:11:26] <bobdoletrasher> back at that corridor
[5:11:28] <+VictorVonLouche> @Agarciahunter Still triggered he got the screw attack and DIDN'T grab those rockets in the room next to him as he stares at the map for like a minute.
[5:11:28] <%Prevot> not gonna lie I only figure that one out by accident
[5:11:30] <+thelovingfool> no allegedly
[5:11:32] <BlackermanZX> you have to open your third eye on that room
[5:11:43] <omnishadeee> if ur still trying for the ramp item do a double check of the room u do the actual speedboost in
[5:11:43] <+Jonesman64> OH this one is mean
[5:11:44] <Dopamien> streamer do thing correctly calebStare
[5:11:45] <+Flunkorg> You have all the tools.
[5:11:48] <iamnotaparrot> @shutupaceyp no. he said hes just going to play as he would naturally and get whats on the way
[5:11:52] <%GeneralSCPatton> I feel like a whole pod of those space whales could actually fend off the X for a little bit if they used group tactics and didn't get totally surrounded.
[5:11:57] <schoolisforwinners> marker on the correct tile
[5:11:59] <+ReallyBigRocks> :)
[5:12:05] <+thelovingfool> his cursor is on the answer lol
[5:12:06] <shotgang86> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[5:12:10] <+HyperCharge_Sam> you got the right idea
[5:12:10] <bobdoletrasher> REEEEE
[5:12:10] <%CAPSLOCKlive> look at nature taking it's course. It's beauty
[5:12:12] <+ReallyBigRocks> :) :)
[5:12:14] <+VictorVonLouche> Woolie kill IQ to like 50 then think about it
[5:12:14] <Dopamien> streamer not doing thing 100% optimally calebStare
[5:12:15] <shotgang86> oh man that marker
[5:12:15] <CrazyMedicine> i love this puzzle
[5:12:17] <+Jonesman64> this hurt me so baed when I found it xD
[5:12:20] <thackattack00> The streamer lacks critical information LUL
[5:12:22] <oneimportantthing> Man this game is great though
[5:12:27] <gaminglink25> he is so close
[5:12:29] <omnishadeee> falling ball shinespark works too
[5:12:31] <+Slattsquatch> I believe
[5:12:31] <+ReallyBigRocks> this is excellent
[5:12:33] <BlackermanZX> this puzle is great
[5:12:33] <TheHotStuven> physical amnesia to figure it out
[5:12:34] <+NeonNobleKalzeria> ooooh lol this one is fun
[5:12:40] <+ReallyBigRocks> entertainment value through the roof
[5:12:42] <+scwry> hey chat, are we on 100% cleanup?
[5:12:51] <schoolisforwinners> No
[5:12:53] <iamnotaparrot> @scwry no
[5:12:54] <TheHotStuven> not really
[5:12:55] <omnishadeee> it is 100% that room u were doing the speedboost in
[5:12:55] <gaminglink25> no
[5:12:56] <BlackermanZX> dont worry about wasting time
[5:12:56] <+thelovingfool> the over think us real and I was right with him
[5:13:00] <+VictorVonLouche> @scwry No he hasn't got his whole arsnal
[5:13:03] <+ReallyBigRocks> you're literally so close
[5:13:05] <IntenseNerdRage> Bets on wheter he does a max or finds out the correct way?
[5:13:07] <+NeonNobleKalzeria> trust your instincts, Woolie. And, failing that, Scan Pulse. LUL
[5:13:08] <Agarciahunter> Overthinking it
[5:13:08] <tmvct1> btw anyone has the max clip? I looked on his channel and only found a clip of some other secret
[5:13:09] <+spawnzie> big give up
[5:13:11] <DevinMayCry> This is some layton tier puzzle
[5:13:11] <+ReallyBigRocks> just a little more head bashing
[5:13:13] <bobdoletrasher> you need to LOOK there @WoolieVersus
[5:13:16] <%GeneralSCPatton> Always be scan pulsing
[5:13:18] <+Flunkorg> Its really stupid lol
[5:13:19] <+thelovingfool> use radar in hall
[5:13:29] <Darren716> You are so close
[5:13:30] <+VictorVonLouche> Scan pulse that corridor for the love of god
[5:13:36] <+Keanotix> don't try get everything right now, you have plenty already
[5:13:44] <omnishadeee> scan in speedbooster corridor
[5:13:45] <peachy996> waste time. It's your time. Own your time
[5:13:47] <IntenseNerdRage> Fuck that, get everytihg
[5:13:50] <+thelovingfool> other hall
[5:13:57] <+ShutUpAceyP> ohhhh i see what he doesn't have
[5:14:00] <IntenseNerdRage> More missles for the storm missle god
[5:14:06] <emMmDeeKay> elbinhaJoinha
[5:14:09] <iamnotaparrot> none of these are as dogshit as the fusion speed booster puzzle with like 200 crumble blocks in it
[5:14:10] <DevinMayCry> Can you feel it?
[5:14:18] <gaminglink25> woolie will never figure it out LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL

[5:14:53] <omnishadeee> if u shinesparked diagonally it still wouldnt work cus u wouldnt keep momentum u would stop
[5:14:53] <bobdoletrasher> PLEASE

[5:17:46] <DedlokPM> @WoolieVersus Max actually did this the hard way last night and then found that block afterwards and was kinda upset. doodBait
[5:17:46] <heartlesshealer> missiles love you <3
[5:17:47] <gaminglink25> only item flash
[5:17:48] <redwidow1358> TWO MISSILES
[5:17:48] <CrazyMedicine> Worth it Kappa
[5:17:49] <IceyCone> you also don't actually need to do that but the other way is harder
[5:17:49] <DevinMayCry> Worth it
[5:17:50] <@Menitta> THAT WASNT PROGRESS???
[5:17:51] <+ReallyBigRocks> I am thoroughly entertained
[5:17:51] <+LinkaroTwitch> You should have seen Max's reaction to this...
[5:17:51] <%ekodrop> i mean you can do it the hard way but that's the intended way
[5:17:51] <%OtakuSnake1> Needed those 2 missiles tho!
[5:17:51] <pi_in_the_sci> it feels dirty, don't it

[5:18:00] <tmvct1> The True METROID Starts Here
[5:18:05] <oneimportantthing> Raven Beak can never defeat you with these TWO LASERS
[5:18:08] <Nocturnment> game let me do the puzzle without the ball shinespark
[5:18:09] <+alphonseisbest> Wait did Max beat this last night?
[5:18:12] <DevinMayCry> @Menitta If that was progress no reviewer would have finished the game
[5:18:13] <%GeneralSCPatton> This is why you always be scanning
[5:18:17] <%xeros720> this teaches you a lot about how they design some item pickups
[5:18:17] <gaminglink25> woolie figured it out
[5:18:21] <+thelovingfool> the block was discolored wools
[5:18:22] <%ekodrop> @alphonseisbest yes. he did it the hard way
[5:18:31] <DedlokPM> @alphonseisbest he beat it a few days ago. He 100%ed last night

[5:18:40] <+Rekinsinn> Can you believe this is baby mode puzzles next to the hardest ones in this game
[5:18:41] <BurdRightsActivist> Raven beak could easily destroy samus if he just put her in a room with no food and a shine puzzle
[5:18:44] <+LinkaroTwitch> Yes.... He found another way but then got mad when he found out later there was that hidden block @alphonseisbest
[5:18:47] <Asuterisuku> If he has Screw Attack now he's so close.
[5:18:47] <lonosis47> No max beat it a while ago already
[5:18:49] <+spawnzie> when we're up against the wall, in our time of need, those 2 missiles will save the day
[5:18:52] <DevinMayCry> Its not obvious to anyone lol
[5:18:55] <+alphonseisbest> oh poor Max LUL
[5:18:59] <+VictorVonLouche> It was LIGHT GREY agaisnt BLACK
[5:19:01] <%LastHazzerd> cuz it's not obvious
[5:19:02] <Deasmeister> I didn't notice that either I just hoped in ball form before turning on shine spark for like 5 mins goddamn it
[5:19:03] <DevinMayCry> My friend took 4 hours
[5:19:06] <Qsmash_> and you thought the Deltarune tunnel vision was bad
[5:19:09] <tmvct1> I blame the COLOURED...... block
[5:19:10] <%CAPSLOCKlive> It's fine, everybody sees it after they see it. never before.
[5:19:14] <+ReallyBigRocks> it's obvious once you see it but man its good at hiding
[5:19:14] <DevinMayCry> Most of that was laying ont he ground broken to be fair
[5:19:17] <penitentpendant> The scan in this game seems a little less informative than the X-ray beam
[5:19:18] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @LinkaroTwitch
[5:19:19] <+alphonseisbest> @VictorVonLouche nah man it was black on black to me
[5:19:22] <+McDerpus> I found it via scanning
[5:19:23] <+thelovingfool> it still took me 30 minute's yeah
[5:19:29] <Agarciahunter> It was the only grey piece on the wall.
[5:19:29] <bobdoletrasher> here we go again
[5:19:30] <pi_in_the_sci> might be from above
[5:19:33] <omnishadeee> the glowy item zone is based on a map grid it isnt centered on the item btw

[5:21:31] <pi_in_the_sci> that lava room has a missle in it
[5:21:35] <Deasmeister> Raven Beak dick is massive - Adam
[5:21:36] <%FenixSeraph> I like that Samus looks even more Eva-like here
[5:21:40] <+DatAsuna> "his dick is very big"
[5:21:53] <Shad0wTag> I need more bird seed - Raven Beak
[5:21:57] <Paperware> Man, the Raven Beak is a pretty cool guy, he kills metroids and doesn't afraid of anything
[5:22:00] <%CAPSLOCKlive> His bird dick is too powerful
[5:22:00] <Agarciahunter> Oh right the red teleporter he missed
[5:22:01] <omnishadeee> woolie not messing around anymore always scanning lol
[5:22:07] <DevinMayCry> My favorite detail in ths games suits is the lights ont he shoulders going further down each upgrade
[5:22:13] <%Prevot> raven beak gets all the birds
[5:22:20] <UnsteadyFunk> ABS Always Be Scanning
[5:22:20] <BlackermanZX> raven beak is the COOLEST GUY -Adam

[5:22:50] <pi_in_the_sci> unexplored lava room above east save room
[5:22:52] <redwidow1358> I refuse
[5:23:01] <%Deft_Thought> You know they say all Chozo are created equal, but you look at me and you look at Raven Beak and you can see that statement is NOT TRUE! See, normally if you go one-on-one with another Mawkin you got a fifty/fifty chance of winning. But I'm a genetic freak, and I'm not normal!
[5:23:13] <DevinMayCry> Raven Beak is busy photoshopping samus as soyjacks and him a chad to defeat Samus
[5:23:51] <%CAPSLOCKlive> At least Raven Beak is not as bad as Mirror Face from Yakuza 7
[5:23:59] <faeron93> We've hit the clean-up phase in the game yeah?
[5:24:01] <Agarciahunter> Does he have the cross bomb?
[5:24:04] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> Red means Dead
[5:24:15] <%RealThiele> ye we in a bit of hall wuggin before progress
[5:24:16] <DevinMayCry> @faeron93 Basically. He doesnt have all the uypgrades but almost there
[5:24:16] <%Namillus> We're not in cleanup yet
[5:24:18] <gaminglink25> no cross bombs
[5:24:20] <+ShutUpAceyP> there weren't any teleporters in any other metroid games were there?
[5:24:21] <Shwepie> @Agarciahunter No, just got Screw Attack.
[5:24:26] <%Deft_Thought> The X are a buncha Mirror Faces running around
[5:24:31] <Agarciahunter> Ok.
[5:24:41] <churropoppa> ok
[5:24:42] <redwidow1358> Samus Returns has teleporters
[5:24:47] <peachy996> Raven Beak still looks cooler than Kai Leng
[5:24:56] <+NeonNobleKalzeria> sussy
[5:24:58] <Shwepie> @ShutUpAceyP Prime 2 & 3 had some teleports.
[5:25:19] <+NeonNobleKalzeria> Samus Returns had teleporters too iirc
[5:25:27] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> big empty space on the map too
[5:25:50] <+RiverKing13> Getting ready for a boss fight?
[5:25:58] <+ShutUpAceyP> just exploring
[5:26:08] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> Just Metroid things
[5:26:54] <lonosis47> How has woolie still not beaten this game
[5:27:07] <+alphonseisbest> he wallhugging
[5:27:11] <+alphonseisbest> or wugging
[5:27:17] <penitentpendant> @lonosis47 Map scraping!
[5:27:18] <mothdude> Woolie's been doing item cleanup
[5:27:18] <faeron93> @lonosis47 Why the rush? Dude is cleaning up the map
[5:27:23] <%CAPSLOCKlive> Why rush it in your first time when he is having fun with it?
[5:27:30] <Darren716> This is Kraid's quick kill btw
[5:27:30] <thackattack00> that's for the quick kill
[5:27:31] <%RealThiele> metroid has M A N Y items
[5:27:33] <lonosis47> Lmao sure
[5:27:36] <+scwry> kraid cannon
[5:27:36] <BlackermanZX> thats the kraid skip
[5:27:37] <+ShutUpAceyP> oooooh that's the thing pat was talking about
[5:27:41] <redwidow1358> @lonosis47 40 minutes of putting round peg into triangle hole
[5:27:43] <%RealThiele> quick kill cannon
[5:27:44] <+Flunkorg> Thats for quick kill sequence break
[5:27:46] <+Mr_Misanthropy> I really want more metroid comics like they had in nintendo power.
[5:27:46] <Deasmeister> kraid skip
[5:27:47] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> If you get the bombs early you can launch it at Kraid
[5:27:47] <+ShutUpAceyP> how are you supposed to get bombs before kraid?
[5:27:55] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> wall jumps
[5:27:57] <+Deosier> sequence breaking
[5:27:57] <+Dr_DangerPhD> sequence break
[5:27:57] <+scwry> seqeunce break
[5:28:03] <+McDerpus> sequence break with slide jumping
[5:28:04] <penitentpendant> Metroid is about map scraping
[5:28:17] <Agarciahunter> Kraid drowned in that somehow
[5:28:29] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[5:28:29] <%CAPSLOCKlive> This is all quite fine
[5:28:33] <fairore> take your time woolie
[5:28:35] <BlackermanZX> and thats completely fine
[5:28:36] <+ShutUpAceyP> he was standing in the lava just fine, but i guess his belly couldn't handle it somehow?
[5:28:37] <faeron93> I was hoping to see a huge corpse underneath
[5:28:39] <lonosis47> Max beat it in 9 hours clean and it was his second metroid
[5:28:40] <jorniev> i mean i dont think he breathes lava
[5:28:44] <+D00msDayDan> meanwhile i'm like please don't get ahead of me during this stream i don't want to get spoiled
[5:28:56] <omnishadeee> an unknown resource! yo!!!!!
[5:28:58] <%Deft_Thought> One ??? acquired
[5:29:01] <IceyCone> I do love that the corpse isn't there actually
[5:29:01] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> Kraid was standing in lava the whole time but then after enough missiles he realized it was lethal
[5:29:12] <+ShutUpAceyP> @CanadianAnimatorGuy lol
[5:29:20] <%RealThiele> the chains held most of him above the lava only the krussy was dunked in it
[5:29:25] <penitentpendant> @jorniev 500 Ton man drowns in own bath water, news at 11!
[5:29:28] <+OroOreo> The WHAT
[5:29:30] <omnishadeee> @CanadianAnimatorGuy only his head wasnt lava resistant clearly
[5:29:32] <%RealThiele> the Krussy
[5:29:40] <+ShutUpAceyP> how does one know the gender of the Kraid?
[5:29:40] <DedlokPM> @CanadianAnimatorGuy it's not even deep enough for him to get engulfed in
[5:29:41] <+OroOreo> sajamSaint
[5:29:48] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> Welcome to the Krussy Krab
[5:29:50] <DevinMayCry> Thats for Kraids Krussy
[5:29:55] <BlackermanZX> thats the kraid skip
[5:30:01] <%RealThiele> Krussy injector
[5:30:26] <omnishadeee> who needs they krussy bombed
[5:30:26] <Laseki> dev reward for sequence breaking lol
[5:30:34] <%MegadBlitz> my guess is like us humans and water, we can stand in it long long enough but dunk us long enough we're fucked
[5:30:37] <+Jonesman64> i hope they left some sequence breaks in...
[5:30:42] <+Left_Justified> Unit 01 colors? evo18MindBlown
[5:30:49] <+Dr_DangerPhD> there's already a bunch of sequence breaks found
[5:30:49] <Tham1k> They did
[5:30:50] <BlackermanZX> theres a ton of sequence breaks already
[5:31:03] <+Jonesman64> yay :D
[5:31:04] <%RealThiele> so you can get early gravity suit, grapple beam, bombs, super missiles, space jump, and more
[5:31:06] <thackattack00> isn't the simplest answer that Samus shooting him a million times killed him and the lava had nothing to do with it?
[5:31:09] <Agarciahunter> I love that they programed that with sequence breaks in mind
[5:31:21] <thackattack00> i don't get the confusion
[5:31:26] <DevinMayCry> @Left_Justified Gravity Suit came first!
[5:31:32] <%CAPSLOCKlive> dunno if it can actually be called sequence breaking if it's designed that way. Sounds more like an alternate path. Can't really break if it was designed to be used
[5:31:35] <+Left_Justified> doubt atpCap
[5:31:37] <%MegadBlitz> I wonder if there will be any soft locking sequence breaks
[5:31:38] <Dopamien> lava doesn't work like this silly game. It's still metal, not orange water
[5:32:02] <omnishadeee> @CAPSLOCKlive well getting early bombs is not exactly easy and requires some funky footwork
[5:32:03] <penitentpendant> @thackattack00 Mostly that's there's not a giant corpse floating in the lava. Since he was chilling in it just fine before.
[5:32:04] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> Lava is Kool-aid in this
[5:32:14] <Agarciahunter> The confusion is that he sunk somehow when it isn‚Äôt that deep
[5:32:17] <Dopamien> Orange fanta PogChamp
[5:32:20] <+Rekinsinn> @CAPSLOCKlive sorta, since it relies on using a technique that's not intuitive and is never taught to you or required anywhere in the game
[5:32:52] <+HakureiIllusion> Isn't it the Gravity Suit that makes the lava behave more like liquid in regards to Samus moving through it
[5:32:57] <thackattack00> @penitentpendant well most metroid enemies evaporate into energy upon death anyway
[5:33:00] <DedlokPM> @thackattack00 except the show him going straight down into the lava,implying that they only things holding him up were his restraints. But when you go back later there isn't enough space for him to sink into.
[5:33:06] <Shwepie> @HakureiIllusion Yes.
[5:33:16] <omnishadeee> unfortunately i dont even think the early bombs is worth it for speedruns and people just kill kraid normally cus beam spam op
[5:33:40] <BlackermanZX> that speedboost puzzle is crazy
[5:33:47] <penitentpendant> @thackattack00 Sorta why they like the 'x' design for enemies so they can handwave that specifically.
[5:33:51] <%CAPSLOCKlive> it reminds me like little tricks to speed up play in games like Resident Evil 1. You can bypass and skip quite a bit with previous run knowledge
[5:33:55] <thackattack00> @DedlokPM but he breaks the restraints in the second phase and is standing up in it. I can stand in a hot tub and not be submerged but lay down in it and go underwater
[5:34:25] <DedlokPM> @thackattack00 he still had the neck one on and when that breaks that is when he sinks straight down
[5:34:29] <%GeneralSCPatton> Presumably Kraid could thermoregulate alright when he was only partly in lava. The full dunk was a bit too much.
[5:34:40] <Agarciahunter> A bit morbid but funny is that when Adam said that something was stopping the thermal energy plant I thought it was kraids corpse clogging the pipes.
[5:34:42] <omnishadeee> only kraids feet are lavaproof
[5:34:49] <Dopamien> I liked early half life 2 speedruns where you had to boop npcs with books to skip dialogue
[5:34:53] <KnivesEve> how many emmi does woolie have left?
[5:34:58] <BlackermanZX> 2
[5:35:00] <%CAPSLOCKlive> Also, Kraid had Belly holes. You can imagine the lava getting inside through those too. Lava proof on the outside, does not mean immune to it inside
[5:35:14] <$NitronStreams> HELL YEAH
[5:35:22] <DevinMayCry> @CAPSLOCKlive They are all like gross
[5:35:30] <DoctorMulholland> 666 current viewers NotLikeThis
[5:35:30] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1447814216103104512?t=FMN9Zf2S4JsthZvBIlfXDQ&s=19
[5:35:38] <DedlokPM> @thackattack00 and it's not even a case of him sliding in in a laying down state. He goes straight down and is dunked in it
[5:35:41] <+Left_Justified> atpHorns
[5:35:51] <thackattack00> ok
[5:35:58] <schoolisforwinners> maybe his hot feet liquified the ground
[5:36:23] <ExpressNode> Woolie vs maze
[5:36:53] <%MegadBlitz> woolie mazes it out
[5:36:57] <xDartuzax> Kraid's Fire Resist potion ran out
[5:37:03] <BlackermanZX> kraid is just vulnerable to salsa
[5:37:19] <%RealThiele> lava in the eyeballs is the worst
[5:37:25] <peachy996> Look guys...
[5:37:28] <ExpressNode> Super Maze Beast
[5:37:34] <peachy996> Maybe Kraid just had an off day
[5:37:34] <penitentpendant> @xDartuzax His Ring of Fire Resistance flew off when he was flailing
[5:37:42] <%MegadBlitz> you know what that feels like?@realthiele
[5:37:42] <Shwepie> In Prime 4 will we learn that Chozo just keep pet Kraids?
[5:38:00] <Darren716> This one is fucking cool
[5:38:01] <penitentpendant> Good ole Shinespark puzzles
[5:38:04] <$Lunaar> I love this game so much, you're probably the fifth playthrough I've watched
[5:38:48] <omnishadeee> charge lasts a while remember dont gotta speedboost right next to it
[5:38:59] <Tham1k> What if speed
[5:39:02] <penitentpendant> Can you Shinespark Slide in this game?
[5:39:05] <roughday25> oh ho?
[5:39:08] <+HakureiIllusion> Intended route
[5:39:12] <+HakureiIllusion> Reset on the slope
[5:39:17] <oneimportantthing> Other M would have been cancelled on Twitter if it got released today lol
[5:39:28] <+Left_Justified> pkcoalOhno
[5:39:29] <BlackermanZX> theres a small slope so it resets
[5:39:38] <$Lunaar> you can carry momentum through sliding, just gotta try again
[5:39:39] <penitentpendant> Looks like the drop resets it
[5:39:40] <notakenplz> jump sooner
[5:39:41] <omnishadeee> its a drop not a clean slide yeah wont work
[5:39:46] <+D00msDayDan> by the time you slide through that gap and you're in the air you've lost the speed boost
[5:39:52] <Agarciahunter> The drop resets
[5:40:02] <$Lunaar> you got this, i don't wanna outright tell you haha
[5:40:04] <emMmDeeKay> When are going to get to the Fireworks Factory!?
[5:40:13] <emMmDeeKay> kzxMonkaTg kzxMonkaTg kzxMonkaTg kzxMonkaTg
[5:40:13] <bobdoletrasher> @WoolieVersus save it and then hit the ramp
[5:40:13] <+HakureiIllusion> Store it, slide through, then reset by sparking onto the slope
[5:40:16] <omnishadeee> pro gamer
[5:40:17] <BlackermanZX> oh shit he did it
[5:40:18] <$NitronStreams> YOO
[5:40:22] <+shieldanvil> store the shine before the slide and reset on the ramp
[5:40:34] <penitentpendant> It nice when a puzzle has multiple solutions
[5:40:41] <Agarciahunter> Oh damn proved us wrong
[5:40:59] <heartlesshealer> yeah, old habit
[5:41:01] <+cubbywolf> yeah I do that
[5:41:01] <+NeonNobleKalzeria> super and others definitely expected you to press opposite the wall
[5:41:13] <+cubbywolf> must have been a Megaman thing
[5:41:15] <+HakureiIllusion> I think this is the first Metroid game that didn't
[5:41:30] <heartlesshealer> especially in 3D games where you have aerial movement after the wall jump
[5:41:38] <+NeonNobleKalzeria> the 1-block drop is going to be a problem
[5:41:38] <shillelaghrod> @HakureiIllusion Samus Returns did it first, from the same devs
[5:41:41] <+HyperCharge_Sam> you lose it when you fall down the block
[5:41:46] <+cubbywolf> oh it was like that in older metroid
[5:41:52] <$NitronStreams> JUMP JUMP SLIDE ALIDE
[5:41:58] <omnishadeee> u can store and then shinespark into the next ramp
[5:42:02] <Sol_Install> oh this speed puzzle
[5:42:05] <Agarciahunter> Ah mm8
[5:42:48] <Shad0wTag> !uptime
[5:42:48] <@Moobot> @Shad0wTag WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 5 hours and 56 minutes
[5:42:51] <peachy996> The way you're doing this is very similar to how people practice combos in fighting
[5:42:51] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[5:43:04] <oneimportantthing> I'm loving the struggle, especially since Woolie chooses this over finishing the game. It's what draws me to his LPs over others lol
[5:43:10] <shillelaghrod> Remember how you had to store shinesparks in Zero Mission?
[5:43:14] <$Lunaar> nnnnnot quite, this is different: the drop before the slide cancels the boost
[5:43:37] <%ekodrop> yeah the drop kills it
[5:43:37] <Aeroallways> best thing about these puzzles is there is more than one way to do them, it's fun seeing which way people choose to do these.
[5:43:43] <omnishadeee> if u shinespark into a ramp it starts a new speedboost remember
[5:43:48] <BlackermanZX> theres multiple routes for this one and its sick
[5:43:50] <$Lunaar> you can store before the slide entirely, then reboost on the upward slopes üëç
[5:43:51] <+Keanotix> hint, you can wall bounce while boosting and it maintains speed
[5:43:53] <glass_marcus> Yea I took a wildly different route to get this
[5:43:57] <+Left_Justified> maybe if he were on a stick atpMurray
[5:44:17] <BlackermanZX> remember the spark store lasts a long time actually
[5:44:49] <$Lunaar> the walls appear to be slanted to prevent and easy wall bounce
[5:44:57] <$Lunaar> prevent an* easy
[5:45:01] <+McDerpus> those slanted roofs are screwing you
[5:45:31] <omnishadeee> u dont gotta run the whole way, shinespark store lasts a while
[5:45:35] <+Left_Justified> zoneThink hmm
[5:45:37] <bobdoletrasher> just dont jump
[5:45:57] <Aeroallways> can't change direction unless it's a wall jump I believe
[5:46:09] <Agarciahunter> Store before the pit?
[5:46:26] <%ekodrop> the change in direction will kill it so you have to use a wall or store
[5:46:35] <+Raspada_Ryner> You might be able to save it there?
[5:46:41] <+thelovingfool> this one's easier to do when you don't have space jump I feel
[5:46:51] <oneimportantthing> Lol I got so frustrated I didn't do the speed booster puzzles
[5:46:58] <BlackermanZX> you can store it before that mid wall section and then flash shift to the block
[5:47:06] <Shwepie> Wait, he knows about resetting on diagonals?
[5:47:12] <pi_in_the_sci> diagonal spark earlier
[5:47:18] <+D00msDayDan> when i looked up this one it blew my mind
[5:47:19] <Agarciahunter> Use your dash
[5:47:36] <omnishadeee> use flash shift woolie
[5:47:37] <penitentpendant> So close
[5:47:38] <@Menitta> thats tight
[5:47:48] <KnivesEve> oh yeah wouldnt the dash help
[5:47:49] <emMmDeeKay> almost
[5:47:58] <@Menitta> can you flash shift and store the spark
[5:48:04] <oneimportantthing> Raven Beak is tapping his foot impatiently as Samus fucks around with puzzles
[5:48:13] <glass_marcus> yea flash shifting helps a ton
[5:48:24] <BlackermanZX> you got this
[5:48:24] <Agarciahunter> Flash shift doesn‚Äôt cause you to use the spark
[5:48:35] <omnishadeee> i think ur space jumping too late

[5:48:44] <Darren716> Honestly give the bottom path another shot
[5:48:46] <%ekodrop> oh right you could use flash
[5:48:47] <emMmDeeKay> can't he doublejump?
[5:48:50] <glass_marcus> once he's at the top he can store and get to the other side pretty easily
[5:49:06] <Asuterisuku> You're going too high.
[5:49:07] <omnishadeee> 1 walljump, 1 space jump
[5:49:07] <Make_me_mad> Yeah this wall jump is just weird. It took me a few tries to get it right.
[5:49:28] <+McDerpus> nice
[5:49:28] <@Menitta> Sick
[5:49:29] <+Lord_Rockman> nice
[5:49:29] <bobdoletrasher> @WoolieVersus save, slide, dash into ramp
[5:49:30] <Agarciahunter> Just timing at this point
[5:49:30] <%ekodrop> nice
[5:49:31] <omnishadeee> nice
[5:49:31] <BlackermanZX> EYYY
[5:49:31] <mothdude> gottem!
[5:49:33] <Uni5> awesome
[5:49:34] <$NitronStreams> YOOOOOOOO
[5:49:36] <SunsetJack> Nice, I did it from the right.
[5:49:37] <%RealThiele> gottem
[5:49:38] <glass_marcus> those sweet 2 missiles
[5:49:39] <AngryAsian5> Congrats
[5:49:39] <Paperware> All that work for 2 missles
[5:49:39] <penitentpendant> Man, the 'two missile' upgrades make you work for 'em
[5:49:41] <Zebroneath> ayyyyy
[5:49:42] <heartlesshealer> üëèüëè
[5:49:43] <+Xanadir> Neato, I did it from the bottom/right as well
[5:49:45] <AngryAsian5> More missiles LUL
[5:49:45] <fairore> nioce
[5:49:46] <peachy996> It's just like figuring out optimals in fightan lol
[5:49:46] <%Namillus> Shinespark + Flash Shift puzzles are great
[5:49:53] <%OtakuSnake1> 2 missiles vargDuane
[5:49:53] <+Jonesman64> man I totally did it the other way lol
[5:49:53] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[5:49:54] <emMmDeeKay> psa2guy missiles!
[5:50:09] <+Funkyfjord> ya chat most of the speed booster puzzles have a couple different ways to do them
[5:50:10] <$NitronStreams> Should've given you a second Space Jump for all that work
[5:50:17] <BurdRightsActivist> I did this one by starting from the bottom and shining on the ramp partways, left side's rough
[5:50:29] <emMmDeeKay> When's Progress?
[5:50:54] <Shwepie> @emMmDeeKay Next stream.
[5:50:54] <+VictorVonLouche> @emMmDeeKay Never
[5:50:56] <Make_me_mad> This is progress. Never have enough missiles or e-tanks.
[5:51:00] <BurdRightsActivist> @emMmDeeKay There is no progress, only 2 missile tanks
[5:51:01] <BlackermanZX> fuck raven beak we need more missiles
[5:51:08] <penitentpendant> @emMmDeeKay The same time as Mahvel
[5:51:17] <emMmDeeKay> woolieDATTEBAYO
[5:51:26] <emMmDeeKay> woolieMIRIN woolieVS woolieDATTEBAYO
[5:52:00] <%Double_Tap_That> woolieGLORY woolieVS woolieFUN woolieVS woolieGIRLS
[5:52:10] <Agarciahunter> Honestly imo the worst speed booster challenge is in burenia.
[5:52:14] <KnivesEve> missile tanks are progress what do you mean
[5:52:23] <$NitronStreams> Who cares about progress collecting pinecones is fun
[5:52:34] <+Jonesman64> i wasn't a big fan of the booster challenge here in Dairon
[5:53:06] <Asuterisuku> I liked it.
[5:53:06] <Agarciahunter> You hurt bosses with missiles so this is progress.
[5:53:26] <schoolisforwinners> "no"
[5:53:27] <%Charronia> Raven Beak will be eating all these missiles he's collected when the time comes
[5:53:28] <+Jonesman64> big assume
[5:53:31] <bobdoletrasher> naw
[5:54:01] <Agarciahunter> Oh he ain‚Äôt getting that one
[5:54:27] <+ShutUpAceyP> is this like when he went and talked with every npc after every day in persona 3?
[5:54:28] <@Menitta> I got that one by accident
[5:54:33] <Asuterisuku> No heart piece left behind.
[5:54:59] <heartlesshealer> exploring is the fun
[5:55:18] <BlackermanZX> oh this one
[5:55:25] <+ShutUpAceyP> can't get this one sadly
[5:55:30] <Agarciahunter> @menitta how? Needs the other bombs right?
[5:55:36] <Asuterisuku> You aren't getting this one yet.
[5:55:40] <+Dr_DangerPhD> it's possible to get this without the powerup, but it's tough
[5:55:45] <+Dr_DangerPhD> the timing is super tight
[5:55:46] <BlackermanZX> yeah not yet sadly
[5:55:50] <@Menitta> no, the energy part above the lava
[5:55:58] <KnivesEve> not possible yet
[5:56:17] <+rahunin> you don't have the upgrade yet
[5:56:29] <DoctorMulholland> yeah that aint happenin man
[5:56:39] <Darren716> Yeahh you need some more stuff
[5:56:43] <BurdRightsActivist> Don't even.
[5:56:45] <Shwepie> @KnivesEve Absolutely possible, but missing an intended upgrade.
[5:56:51] <+Jonesman64> i was staring at this one for hours till i got the thing I needed
[5:57:36] <Agarciahunter> You can probably do something with shines to get it early but I can‚Äôt imagine the timing needed
[5:57:36] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[5:58:02] <+Dr_DangerPhD> @Agarciahunter that's how I did it, but it's super tight timing
[5:58:04] <+Jonesman64> timing has to be insane to get that with just shines... that bomb block and those missile blocks.. oof
[5:58:08] <Asuterisuku> Has he been back to a certain area since getting Screw Attack?
[5:58:30] <penitentpendant> @Asuterisuku Tis what we're doin' now. Map scrapin'
[5:58:32] <+ShutUpAceyP> he's been exploring around since getting it
[5:59:10] <+thelovingfool> "im not doing 100%"
[5:59:13] <BlackermanZX> this ones easy
[5:59:28] <penitentpendant> @thelovingfool 98% is not 100%
[5:59:36] <+ShutUpAceyP> you can spin jump without consuming the shinespark no?
[5:59:45] <Asuterisuku> Wall jump is your friend.
[5:59:53] <Agarciahunter> @dr_dangerphd damn I tried for like 30 mins but I could only get the 3 missile block broken before shine ran out.
[6:00:10] <pi_in_the_sci> scan again
[6:00:14] <heartlesshealer> now figure it out from here :)
[6:00:23] <heartlesshealer> yay
[6:00:39] <+thelovingfool> this one is fun
[6:01:09] <+Jonesman64> he's going to do this ine a weird tester way
[6:01:37] <churropoppa> you can cancel the screw attack my shooting
[6:02:36] <penitentpendant> I was looking at those blocks and going, "Have you ever been able to 'Down Shinespark'"?
[6:02:45] <heartlesshealer> going down the up escalator
[6:02:46] <marumariball> this one is a really hard spark
[6:02:48] <+Jonesman64> oh here it comes..
[6:02:50] <+thelovingfool> oh fuck this one
[6:02:55] <Agarciahunter> You can down spark.
[6:02:55] <ct_2> this one's fun
[6:02:56] <marumariball> you have like less than a second on the timer
[6:02:59] <+Jonesman64> this is the one that taught me a LOT
[6:02:59] <Make_me_mad> This one is a real motherfucker.
[6:03:00] <BlackermanZX> Now THIS is the one
[6:03:02] <Agarciahunter> Oh this one
[6:03:03] <+Kiaayo> this one's fucked
[6:03:05] <Asuterisuku> This one is NOT a Spark.
[6:03:06] <$NitronStreams> Samus Has A Need For Speed
[6:03:10] <BurdRightsActivist> OH NO THIS ONE NotLikeThis
[6:03:14] <notakenplz> omae wa mou shindeiru
[6:03:22] <pi_in_the_sci> nah, that's a pitfall block, it's from over here
[6:03:22] <heartlesshealer> pitfall block means THIS side :)
[6:03:33] <bobdoletrasher> yep
[6:03:46] <+minibarfs_> YOU GOT THIS WOOLIE
[6:03:48] <DedlokPM> @penitentpendant yes. I think there was one in one of the games. Also he literally just did one just now to exit his shine spark
[6:03:50] <BlackermanZX> remember shinespark store lasts a long time
[6:04:00] <+Kiaayo> @BlackermanZX not long enough
[6:04:08] <bobdoletrasher> i didnt even know of the shine wall jump when i did this
[6:04:14] <$NitronStreams> Next 2 hours here we come!
[6:04:22] <BlackermanZX> its completely possible from this side
[6:04:25] <reonome> store the spark
[6:04:34] <pi_in_the_sci> got to store it
[6:04:36] <Goergorion> other side maybe?
[6:04:37] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1447814216103104512?t=FMN9Zf2S4JsthZvBIlfXDQ&s=19
[6:04:37] <Agarciahunter> Yeah you got to get crazy with this one.
[6:04:46] <+Jonesman64> I did this one with out storing the spark...
[6:04:48] <penitentpendant> @DedlokPM Must have come up very rarely, the diagonals and ball spark I remember
[6:04:51] <Agarciahunter> You had it
[6:05:07] <marumariball> thats the idea you got it
[6:05:10] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @lonosis47
[6:05:17] <bobdoletrasher> shoot to cancel the screw @WoolieVersus
[6:05:18] <+ShutUpAceyP> Samus Aran's one weakness. Slopes
[6:05:38] <BlackermanZX> gotta do it right bellow the platform
[6:05:38] <bobdoletrasher> he doesnt know about the ramp dash
[6:05:44] <Asuterisuku> You can slope store the soark if you're doing it that way.
[6:05:47] <omnishadeee> remember u can spark into a ramp to restart speedbooster and store a new spark
[6:05:50] <Halospaz117> I don't think the slope helps this one
[6:05:51] <Agarciahunter> You gotta get higher
[6:05:53] <Halospaz117> Didn't for me at least
[6:06:01] <mothdude> I did it without ramp dash but it's tight.
[6:06:04] <bobdoletrasher> it do
[6:06:06] <+minibarfs_> you can totally walljump up there
[6:06:08] <+minibarfs_> you got this
[6:06:19] <BlackermanZX> you can start running from the right
[6:06:23] <Halospaz117> ... fuck why did I never use the flash step during any of the shine sparks...
[6:06:26] <Make_me_mad> Walljump up to the first ledge, then store the shinespark.
[6:06:32] <+thelovingfool> yeah i had to rampdash too
[6:06:33] <marumariball> its about 6 seconds
[6:06:34] <Make_me_mad> Give you more time to jump to the top.
[6:06:36] <Agarciahunter> Store the shine higher
[6:06:45] <bobdoletrasher> just ramp dash
[6:06:46] <omnishadeee> u can reset speedbooster on ramp remember
[6:06:48] <$NitronStreams> Its hard to see when thespark runs out durring a screw attack
[6:06:51] <%xeros720> oh this one
[6:06:57] <mothdude> Yeah it won't last long enough if it's stored at the bottom
[6:07:14] <Shwepie> Especially not the bottom right.
[6:07:15] <pi_in_the_sci> reset at the slope or store it later
[6:07:18] <%Prevot> I think I did this by running on the top instead of the bottom.
[6:07:20] <%xeros720> i actually speed boosted from the bottom room, wall jumped up and then stored the spark then jumped up
[6:07:25] <omnishadeee> i think the game has rumble for when ur shinespark is stored should help u know when its gone
[6:07:27] <Make_me_mad> It is possible to store it from the bottom and jump up. I managed it that way, just barely. But it's easier to walljump up one level before you store the spark.
[6:07:30] <%CAPSLOCKlive> We dreading it now boys
[6:07:33] <+Kiaayo> running to the right seems like a waste of time
[6:07:33] <BlackermanZX> pretty sure you can store it on the platform too
[6:07:34] <hewlettfan96> What‚Äôs the minimum bit cheer for readout??
[6:07:37] <IceyCone> maybe grapple is faster?
[6:07:39] <wiffernubbin> go up a level
[6:07:42] <DoctorMulholland> Will Woolie figure it out?
[6:07:44] <tangowulf> How many of us are sticking around just because we want to see Woolie's reaction to the ending?
[6:07:45] <omnishadeee> u can store on the ramp
[6:07:57] <DoctorMulholland> YE YE YE SLOPE BOY
[6:07:57] <pi_in_the_sci> slope resets are a thing
[6:08:01] <Bananassassin> "Not gonna fuck with this" continues to fuck with it
[6:08:08] <Maxiheeho> you need to press down as soon as shinespark comes up
[6:08:13] <redwidow1358> Slope resets are for pussies on this one
[6:08:14] <bobdoletrasher> yea
[6:08:14] <heartlesshealer> hit the slope too high
[6:08:15] <omnishadeee> u hit the slope too high
[6:08:16] <BlackermanZX> missed the slope
[6:08:17] <bobdoletrasher> just doen again
[6:08:18] <DoctorMulholland> On the right track
[6:08:19] <Agarciahunter> You can but you need to shine
[6:08:19] <Tham1k> But that slope has a wall
[6:08:20] <%CAPSLOCKlive> You got it!!
[6:08:24] <%xeros720> slope would work, but it's really small
[6:08:32] <BlackermanZX> there ya go
[6:08:35] <omnishadeee> u can
[6:08:46] <bobdoletrasher> too high @WoolieVersus
[6:08:54] <+minibarfs_> It's easier to not store it and walljump up
[6:08:55] <Agarciahunter> You can jump though
[6:09:01] <BurdRightsActivist> Megghgh roid
[6:09:29] <Make_me_mad> The thing that makes me the most sad is we won't get this samus in smash.
[6:09:43] <Agarciahunter> I don‚Äôt think you can store on slopes
[6:09:48] <tangowulf> @make_me_mad I KNOW RIGHT?!?
[6:09:48] <%CAPSLOCKlive> He see's it, he got it, he Figured. It. OUT.
[6:09:48] <%Dr00_PhD> you can
[6:09:55] <DoctorMulholland> AHHHH CLOSE
[6:09:59] <BlackermanZX> actually the slope tech seems harder than just space jumping up
[6:10:03] <Qsmash_> this is probably the hardest way to do this
[6:10:05] <%xeros720> yeah i agree, a slope can continue it, but you can't store on it
[6:10:09] <Darren716> Try running from the other direction?
[6:10:14] <+Lord_Rockman> he has it!
[6:10:14] <%Dr00_PhD> you were saying
[6:10:16] <+thelovingfool> probably better to wall jump then store
[6:10:17] <heartlesshealer> yay
[6:10:19] <%xeros720> ahaha, nice, you did it, shows what i know
[6:10:20] <omnishadeee> one guy in chat
[6:10:26] <powerprotoman> this is certainly a way to do this
[6:10:28] <+thelovingfool> had it
[6:10:29] <$NitronStreams> SO CLOSE
[6:10:33] <%Lord_Rockman> Lord_Rockman subscribed with Prime. 
[6:10:35] <IceyCone> oh shit I forgot that slopes work like that
[6:10:39] <%CAPSLOCKlive> HE GOT IT
[6:10:39] <BurdRightsActivist> oooOOGUUGHHFF
[6:10:40] <AngryAsian5> NOICE
[6:10:41] <BlackermanZX> Eyyyy
[6:10:41] <%xeros720> congrats
[6:10:42] <SunsetJack> Bingo
[6:10:43] <Onjani> It is cool to see that you can do these multiple ways though
[6:10:43] <DoctorMulholland> YEEEEEEEESSS
[6:10:43] <heartlesshealer> YOU DID IT
[6:10:44] <$NitronStreams> NIIIIICE
[6:10:45] <mothdude> YEAHYEAHYEAH
[6:10:47] <BurdRightsActivist> yeyeye
[6:10:47] <omnishadeee> enjoy ur etank

[6:10:51] <Shwepie> ennsGolf
[6:10:56] <Halospaz117> Good job man, I think I just managed to carry the spark from the bottom through sheer stubbornness
[6:10:57] <Tham1k> Spark puzzleeeesssss
[6:10:59] <%BisoromiBear> woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE
[6:11:00] <gaminglink25> NotLikeThis
[6:11:08] <omnishadeee> u were meant to do it from this room ya
[6:11:10] <Maxiheeho> @Shwepie same lol
[6:11:11] <Agarciahunter> Congratulations you did it differently.
[6:11:11] <BurdRightsActivist> blow up the thingy
[6:11:12] <%LastHazzerd> This game makes ya work for the extra stuff
[6:11:21] <Halospaz117> But seriously these are some Zero Mission shinesparks
[6:11:37] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[6:11:37] <powerprotoman> @omnishadeee and i did it from a completely different way
[6:11:51] <omnishadeee> @omnishadeee very cool
[6:11:51] <mothdude> I like how a lot of these shinespark puzzles have multiple ways to do them
[6:12:22] <DevinMayCry> Dairon Dairon Dairon
[6:12:22] <Make_me_mad> I am a metroid fan, but nothing aggravates me more than seeing a shinespark puzzle. I still do them, but I seethe the entire time.
[6:12:24] <Asuterisuku> There is no spark in this game that's as hard as what ZM made you do for 100
[6:13:01] <redwidow1358> Chozodia energy tank featuring five ramps
[6:13:02] <Shwepie> @Make_me_mad I love them and I want more.
[6:13:03] <+minibarfs_> @Asuterisuku please don't take me back to that hell
[6:13:30] <%Dr00_PhD> ZM sparks annoyed the hell outta me
[6:13:50] <Agarciahunter> @asuterisuku your taking about that ball spark one where you had to go like 2 screens keeping a shine stored right?
[6:13:50] <IceyCone> speed booster puzzles in this game are great just cause how fluid it feels
[6:14:01] <Sonny_Firestorm> @WoolieVersus Fun Story: I seldom had Nintendo consoles so I'm not familiar with Metroid, but because of Guacamelee I'm familiar with a lot of mechanics I'm seeing here. Funny how that works, huh? LUL
[6:14:06] <Asuterisuku> Oh this one.
[6:14:09] <Halospaz117> Dude that last Zero Mission spark made actually have to come bark for it after I beat the game already
[6:14:15] <Darren716> Yeah I think this is a later one
[6:14:17] <omnishadeee> this is indeed a not yet
[6:14:18] <IceyCone> granted it took me way too long to figure out you could slide with it
[6:14:18] <+rahunin> yup
[6:14:18] <BlackermanZX> pretty sure not yet either
[6:14:19] <Asuterisuku> You're not getting this either
[6:14:20] <pixelkingu> not yet
[6:14:42] <+minibarfs_> does he not have the cross bombs yet?
[6:14:48] <gaminglink25> no
[6:15:00] <+minibarfs_> oh damn i thought they were earlier than this
[6:15:05] <Shwepie> @minibarfs_ Nope, only Screw Attack.
[6:15:06] <glass_marcus> Adam doesn't tell you shit
[6:15:10] <Make_me_mad> "Raven Beak will body you, don't even try samus"
[6:15:11] <Agarciahunter> No he got the screw attack and proceeded to do other stuff
[6:15:21] <+D00msDayDan> oh god there are secret zones that aren't highlighted blue on the map
[6:15:25] <+thelovingfool> progress iirc was back where the grev suit was
[6:15:32] <+thelovingfool> i cant remember
[6:15:45] <BlackermanZX> ghavoran is somewhat unexplored
[6:15:48] <Shwepie> @D00msDayDan Shhh, that's a secret.
[6:15:55] <Saltmeisterr> is woolie going for hundo
[6:15:58] <omnishadeee> @D00msDayDan thats the dumbest shit ngl
[6:15:59] <lonosis47> Hes still far from beating the game zekeLUL zekeLUL zekeLUL zekeLUL zekeLUL
[6:16:20] <Asuterisuku> Progress is among the trees.
[6:16:49] <+thelovingfool> oh christ right the emmi
[6:16:53] <Agarciahunter> @omnishadeee that‚Äôs why you spam the scanner
[6:17:04] <Make_me_mad> I think progress is in Burenia? I don't even remember I beat this game in like two days. It's basically a fever dream of screw attacking the roofs.
[6:17:31] <Agarciahunter> Remember the screw attack stuff in the trees?
[6:17:34] <+thelovingfool> i think youre trying to get back to the green tele?
[6:17:36] <omnishadeee> @Agarciahunter takes a long time to spam the scanner when ur at the end of the game already uncovered the map still not 100% and nothing on the map showing that an area might be sus
[6:17:36] <heartlesshealer> there's a difference between beating the game and finding everything the game has to offer
[6:17:56] <Make_me_mad> I mean, I did 100 percent the game. It was just two solid days of this, so it all blends.
[6:18:14] <Asuterisuku> I was trying not to be specific because finding this stuff is the fun part.

[6:24:27] <+ShutUpAceyP> oh i just did this one
[6:24:29] <hewlettfan96> How we doing??
[6:24:31] <+ShutUpAceyP> not possible for woolie yet
[6:24:31] <KnivesEve> im actually jealous of woolie's parries
[6:24:32] <$Kaiser_Loar> That parry timing is on lock down Woolie. G Damn!
[6:24:36] <BlackermanZX> not yet either
[6:24:47] <Halospaz117> I think you can kinda cheese this one?
[6:24:48] <+VictorVonLouche> Woolie you are missing a key skill on this one in particular
[6:24:54] <omnishadeee> i did this with power bomb no idea how to do it without
[6:25:02] <gaminglink25> not yet
[6:25:02] <+trackles_64> isnt there also another metroid in development?
[6:25:11] <bobdoletrasher> naw not yet
[6:25:13] <+Jonesman64> Prime 4 yeah
[6:25:13] <%RealThiele> prime 4 is in dev hell
[6:25:14] <$Kaiser_Loar> Look up
[6:25:14] <%Lord_Rockman> metroid prime 4
[6:25:15] <fairore> prime 4 yeah
[6:25:19] <%Namillus> Metroid Prime 4 is... happening apparently?
[6:25:41] <BurdRightsActivist> We getting smt v, bayo 3, now all we need is prime 4
[6:25:42] <Agarciahunter> @omnishadeee how?
[6:25:44] <IceyCone> Prime 4 was restarted a while ago to be made by retro
[6:25:45] <R_Blaze> If Bayo 3 ca nhappen then I'm holding out for Prime 4 soon
[6:25:58] <IceyCone> however this year has not been kind to retro
[6:25:58] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[6:26:11] <+HakureiIllusion> @omnishadeee Normal way to do this is to drop off the ledge and cross bomb in midair to destroy both rows of bomb blocks at once without destroying the lower row, then standing on the lower row to grapple.
[6:26:14] <%CAPSLOCKlive> Everything is happening until it gets cancelled.
[6:26:15] <Asuterisuku> Until Retro starts talking about it publicly, Prime 4 doesn't exist.
[6:26:34] <+ShutUpAceyP> ey... that's how i did that
[6:27:05] <BlackermanZX> theres no prime 4 in ba sing se
[6:27:16] <penitentpendant> Prime 4 will be the new Bayonetta 3
[6:27:30] <Shwepie> Skipping Cross Bomb? I'm down.
[6:27:30] <heartlesshealer> oh this
[6:27:33] <omnishadeee> @omnishadeee ah ty
[6:27:37] <%CAPSLOCKlive> look at this progress
[6:27:46] <+VictorVonLouche> woolie skiped the bomb upgrade didnt he? lol
[6:27:51] <SunsetJack> Is X skippable?
[6:27:59] <Darren716> Wait how did he miss that?
[6:28:01] <Agarciahunter> Yes
[6:28:03] <BlackermanZX> didnt even realize this is a skip
[6:28:20] <IceyCone> cause he didn't go back to that area
[6:28:27] <Shwepie> @Darren716 He got the Screw Attack and then went right instead of left.
[6:28:29] <omnishadeee> notice that ship on display?
[6:28:56] <omnishadeee> its the ship that deployed the emmis at the start of the game
[6:28:56] <BlackermanZX> the wrestlemania sign
[6:28:58] <+VictorVonLouche> Thats a Fed ship
[6:29:00] <%CAPSLOCKlive> he can't skip what he doesn't know, technically speaking he just didnt found it yet
[6:29:10] <%RealThiele> shits locked
[6:29:41] <pi_in_the_sci> diffusion beam that wall
[6:29:57] <Asuterisuku> The wall's too thick.
[6:30:09] <Make_me_mad> @pi_in_the_sci Diffusion beam was tried. Won't cut it.
[6:30:11] <BlackermanZX> the tp tho
[6:31:03] <pi_in_the_sci> @Make_me_mad Ah, I went to pee and just got back
[6:31:17] <%LastHazzerd> fuck these walls
[6:31:17] <penitentpendant> I'm surprised how 'late' you get Morphball in this game and how 'early' you get Screw Attack
[6:31:23] <%LastHazzerd> play the fude
[6:31:29] <AngryAsian5> The walls always lie
[6:31:47] <Qsmash_> just parry him bro its easy
[6:31:55] <Gelphaze> worth the wait!
[6:31:57] <SunsetJack> Oh
[6:32:00] <+VictorVonLouche> negative progress
[6:32:13] <Shwepie> Progress negated.
[6:32:22] <BlackermanZX> still missing a key item
[6:32:27] <Agarciahunter> You made a short cut
[6:32:32] <mothdude> Is that item required?
[6:32:36] <+VictorVonLouche> Negative progress + now
[6:32:44] <+MinoMiushi> He has all the items
[6:32:48] <emeraldskrull> woolieDATTEBAYO_HF
[6:32:53] <+MinoMiushi> He just needs to hit that storm missile door
[6:32:54] <penitentpendant> And this is why I hate one-way doors
[6:33:05] <penitentpendant> Blessed be they remain open
[6:33:05] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1447814216103104512?t=FMN9Zf2S4JsthZvBIlfXDQ&s=19
[6:33:17] <Agarciahunter> @mothdude technically no
[6:33:27] <+VictorVonLouche> BEAM mand
[6:33:43] <iamnotaparrot> keep shooting lol
[6:33:44] <%LastHazzerd> sweat frog
[6:33:49] <%Prevot> man I struggled so much with the EMMI in this room
[6:33:49] <+VictorVonLouche> SHOOT THE BEAM
[6:33:51] <+MinoMiushi> B E A M
[6:33:52] <BlackermanZX> lol shoot it
[6:33:52] <+Ropcord> LUL
[6:33:53] <%FenixSeraph> streak ended
[6:33:54] <penitentpendant> Royal Guard REVOKED
[6:33:55] <pi_in_the_sci> not missles, just beam
[6:33:59] <+thelovingfool> just shoot lol
[6:34:01] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> He's bad at getting that counter huh?
[6:34:01] <Halospaz117> quit feeling yourself on stream
[6:34:03] <%RealThiele> perfect parry, cant shoot ball
[6:34:07] <%LastHazzerd> @PlaidisTheNewPlaid no?
[6:34:26] <Agarciahunter> Yeah was really confused
[6:34:34] <KasiCrafter> Zooming in with THE DREAD
[6:34:41] <Vertigheist> @PlaidisTheNewPlaid you weren't here when he did it 3 times consecutively?
[6:34:47] <+VictorVonLouche> yes finally
[6:34:55] <K1llingEdge> Foolishness Woolie foolishness
[6:35:07] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> @PlaidisTheNewPlaid I actually wasn't, sorry I missed that, it sounds cool af
[6:35:12] <Make_me_mad> Do the normal ice missiles do more damage than the homing missiles?
[6:35:12] <+MinoMiushi> Oh yeah there was a debug
[6:35:17] <+HakureiIllusion> Screw attack that thing
[6:35:18] <Halospaz117> so here's something I don't think I ever figured out, how powerful is one lock of the storm missiles compared to a single super missile?
[6:35:22] <Make_me_mad> I felt like they did. Hardly ever used the seeker missiles.
[6:35:22] <+MinoMiushi> Ice missiles do 280 dmg, stor mmissiles do 75 each
[6:35:31] <+youngjwilliams> Are storm missles actually worth the wait or is it better to just mash ice?
[6:35:34] <omnishadeee> lul
[6:35:35] <+Kiaayo> @Make_me_mad it's a matter of dps
[6:35:36] <Alzero83> Screw attack 1 shots it
[6:35:41] <%LastHazzerd> LUL
[6:35:42] <penitentpendant> "Screw (Attack) You!"
[6:35:42] <Alzero83> after the armor falls
[6:35:43] <%Namillus> Storm Missiles are broken
[6:35:46] <KasiCrafter> Lookin like Megaman out here
[6:35:47] <omnishadeee> @youngjwilliams better to mash ice
[6:35:56] <redwidow1358> Storm missiles are better when dodging and charging, and to fire while evading (in situations where you couldn't easily aim at the enemy)
[6:35:58] <%Namillus> If you get the full locks with Storm it deals way more damage over time
[6:36:03] <Agarciahunter> But a full lock on is like 1000 damage I think
[6:36:13] <+MinoMiushi> Rapid beam is the best DPS on anything that it doesn't bounce off, then ice missiles
[6:36:18] <Halospaz117> Yeah I figured if you managed to get like 5 locks on one target it'd be better
[6:36:32] <+Issun135> charge beam + missile combos should be the bread and butter for all boss fights
[6:36:33] <redwidow1358> The full lock on is pretty damn good
[6:36:34] <$NitronStreams> OOOOOH
[6:36:36] <omnishadeee> 1 storm lock (3 micromissiles) = 450 damage, 1 ice missile = 400
[6:36:37] <Shwepie> @MinoMiushi Where did you find the damage values?
[6:36:41] <+D00msDayDan> the important thing about storm missiles during bosses is it lets you stay mobile while storing up more damage than a charge beam
[6:36:42] <+ShutUpAceyP> hard emmi fight INCOMING
[6:36:44] <%RealThiele> yea this lock is unique its a bit odd
[6:36:44] <BlackermanZX> time for THE DREAD
[6:36:48] <+youngjwilliams> But not everything can get 5 locks yeah?
[6:36:54] <+MinoMiushi> No values, just practice
[6:37:02] <+MinoMiushi> Fight the final boss with missiles vs beam spam
[6:37:11] <+MinoMiushi> Beam spam does it in one or two parry cycles less
[6:37:24] <AngryAsian5> LUL
[6:37:26] <redwidow1358> OH NO
[6:37:29] <Asuterisuku> I'm trying to figure out how he got here without entering afea H.
[6:37:43] <Halospaz117> What this man is getting away with should be illegal
[6:37:48] <Shwepie> @MinoMiushi You literally gave number values though.
[6:37:55] <redwidow1358> This should be illegal tbh
[6:37:55] <+alternative_flu> whoa
[6:37:56] <AngryAsian5> DAMN
[6:37:56] <SunsetJack> Why
[6:37:57] <pi_in_the_sci> there's another pushblock behind you
[6:37:58] <+keiji_maede> xD
[6:37:58] <BlackermanZX> OH
[6:37:58] <+TheyCallMeVawn> But why Woolie
[6:37:59] <$NitronStreams> FUCK OFF
[6:37:59] <%RealThiele> LUL
[6:37:59] <redwidow1358> lol RIP
[6:38:00] <Halospaz117> THE HUBRIS
[6:38:00] <+VictorVonLouche> Yes touch the kill bot woolie
[6:38:01] <Agarciahunter> I think some one hacked a dev kit to get the numbers
[6:38:02] <%Namillus> People got into debug
[6:38:04] <Deadpool2450> got too slick with it
[6:38:04] <+Hollow_Mirage> Literally why tho?
[6:38:04] <+alphonseisbest> u had it!
[6:38:05] <+alternative_flu> it got you good damn
[6:38:07] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> But why though?
[6:38:08] <penitentpendant> Why'd you run up on the Potemkin?
[6:38:11] <+alphonseisbest> good run tho
[6:38:13] <+MinoMiushi> Yes cause there's a twitter video of Experiment 57 in debug mode
[6:38:14] <+ShutUpAceyP> try to look sick, get the stick
[6:38:14] <+eanscrale> and that's why daigo won folks
[6:38:14] <%LastHazzerd> even if you succeeded the door woulda closed
[6:38:20] <BlackermanZX> dashed into command grab
[6:38:34] <redwidow1358> Directly into command grab
[6:38:35] <+alphonseisbest> man that was dope almost
[6:38:35] <+MinoMiushi> Like how 57 heals when he does the tentacles on the wall
[6:38:43] <%RealThiele> clearance revoked
[6:38:49] <Agarciahunter> Door would have locked you in
[6:38:53] <+MinoMiushi> 57 is immune to uncharged beam spam though
[6:38:55] <iamnotaparrot> damn. and you still got 1 more emmi to go. bet the last one will be insane
[6:38:56] <omnishadeee> depends on the boss and boss phase too, they get missile/beam damage reduction sometimes
[6:38:56] <+VictorVonLouche> woolie no
[6:38:56] <+Issun135> cant wait for the dread spoiler cast when that happens
[6:38:57] <pi_in_the_sci> wide block behind you
[6:39:03] <+youngjwilliams> So he really kept up with the insane parries huh?
[6:39:05] <penitentpendant> The greed!
[6:39:09] <penitentpendant> The parry!
[6:39:10] <SunsetJack> Greedy
[6:39:14] <mothdude> BRUH

[6:42:38] <%RealThiele> Now that you got the wave beam, there is a way to fake wave beam to break the game early
[6:42:39] <miucsa51> KomodoHype
[6:42:40] <heartlesshealer> new puzzle option <3
[6:42:49] <DSD24> Emmis
[6:43:02] <Halospaz117> Yeah they're a proper fight
[6:43:10] <Agarciahunter> @realthiele how?
[6:43:20] <+thelovingfool> the last ones are proper puzzles
[6:43:22] <+ScatFace> oh he's late into the game too, that's nice
[6:43:22] <+VictorVonLouche> Woolie you can aim instead of hopping
[6:43:26] <redwidow1358> I hope you're real fucking prepared for the final EMMI battle
[6:43:34] <%RealThiele> @Agarciahunter it deals with spin jumping off walls, some shots will pass through walls as you are spinning its wacky
[6:43:39] <+MightyDuckShoes> Is the armor appearance all cosmetic?
[6:43:40] <+HakureiIllusion> For the anti-air https://clips.twitch.tv/FairGeniusDragonOSkomodo-ss0R6RtGT1DJHptm
[6:43:42] <NiniGiovanini> nah, thet always did that, you just didn't noticed it
[6:43:44] <double_zr_tap> hi hi
[6:43:46] <+ScatFace> is woolie planning on doing 100% item completion during this run?
[6:43:50] <omnishadeee> @Agarciahunter weird inconsistent shit theres a few ways to do it
[6:43:51] <+youngjwilliams> How was the experiment fight?
[6:43:54] <redwidow1358> He's not doing 100%
[6:44:07] <+ScatFace> good, better content that way
[6:44:09] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah 100% might be an off-stream thing
[6:44:15] <BlackermanZX> is that missing power up skippable?
[6:44:17] <penitentpendant> What was the secret in the SW?
[6:44:18] <TheHardM> @MightyDuckShoes No. Every suit is a direct upgrade from the last.
[6:44:42] <+ScatFace> that's been true for every metroid
[6:44:47] <KasiCrafter> LAST LEVEL LESGO
[6:44:49] <Agarciahunter> Sounds like a spread runners dream then cause you can get a lot of stuff early then
[6:44:52] <+VictorVonLouche> Oh he sequenced broke the game
[6:44:52] <$razielhex> Finally, the land
[6:44:52] <Darren716> Oh wow, is he gonna totally skip c bomb?
[6:44:58] <+MightyDuckShoes> @TheHardM  Oh cool
[6:45:03] <DSD24> Samus does a Powerbomb?
[6:45:06] <SunsetJack> Yea, X bomb got skipped.
[6:45:12] <%Dr00_PhD> @DSD24 i wish
[6:45:14] <Deasmeister> Oh yeah bomb skipped
[6:45:15] <Halospaz117> Imagine if Samus unlocked the Powerbomb and she just started doing the wrestling powerbomb instead
[6:45:18] <%RealThiele> Harambeia
[6:45:19] <+ShutUpAceyP> no he still need cross bomb
[6:45:22] <+Issun135> not quite
[6:45:23] <+ScatFace> normal bomb's been skipped?
[6:45:28] <BlackermanZX> hes missing the thing from ghavoran
[6:45:28] <+youngjwilliams> Is anyone else slightly bothered by the green on the hips of the grav suit?
[6:45:29] <DSD24> @Dr00_PhD I could see her doing that to a boss honestly
[6:45:35] <+VictorVonLouche> Yeah the crossbomb got skipped
[6:45:47] <schoolisforwinners> rip
[6:45:57] <Louie_Salmon> @shutupaceyp I believe it isn't strictly needed at any point, he should be good
[6:46:13] <Darren716> Still he should get it
[6:46:20] <Darren716> Missing an actual power is lame
[6:46:20] <+ScatFace> oh cross bomb, I think you need it for item completion but I don't remember it being required for game progression
[6:46:23] <+VictorVonLouche> Wonder if the story will let him go this way
[6:46:27] <schoolisforwinners> nope
[6:46:32] <+VictorVonLouche> Nope
[6:46:33] <penitentpendant> Oh, that's one way
[6:46:34] <Agarciahunter> When should we tell him that he pulled off a sequence break?
[6:46:36] <Asuterisuku> Te man breaking sequences and not even knowing the sequence he's breaking.
[6:46:36] <essence_of_lariatto> Guess he has to get it
[6:46:38] <SunsetJack> Oh hey
[6:46:45] <Halospaz117> Yeah you can only go so far from this entrance
[6:46:47] <JacknZack27> I‚Äôm pretty sure you get stuck here
[6:46:55] <BlackermanZX> oh then hes has to get it
[6:47:08] <+DatAsuna> power bomb too powerful
[6:47:08] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[6:47:09] <+Issun135> cross bomb is not skippable for this reason
[6:47:09] <Deasmeister> Are we going backwards through this area?
[6:47:12] <schoolisforwinners> yes
[6:47:18] <+ScatFace> it's best to tell him then
[6:47:20] <+Issun135> cant back enter hanubia
[6:47:20] <+VictorVonLouche> It is not
[6:47:26] <shillelaghrod> Just mid air morph
[6:47:27] <+HakureiIllusion> Can just ZL into morph ball from above

[6:48:31] <gaminglink25> go back to ghovarin

[6:48:40] <bobdoletrasher> @woolieversus that's story shit

[6:52:19] <omnishadeee> ingame timer resets on death
[6:52:23] <mark1247> Ummm did woolie not get that thing yet chat ?
[6:52:25] <BlackermanZX> this game is chunky
[6:52:35] <glass_marcus> he did not
[6:52:37] <redwidow1358> Woolie skipped the bomb upgrade
[6:52:40] <mark1247> Cause he doing one bomb at a time
[6:52:40] <+HakureiIllusion> Time resets on death and doesn't involve cutscenes, loading, screen transitions, map time, etc.
[6:52:41] <Deasmeister> @scatface first time through time doesn't really matter imo
[6:52:42] <Shwepie> He has been. I believe timer doesn't count deaths.
[6:52:42] <shillelaghrod> time doesn't matter, zero suit samus is mortal but completion percentage is eternal
[6:52:47] <mark1247> @redwidow1358 thanks
[6:52:47] <+Issun135> hes on his way back to jungle
[6:52:48] <+VictorVonLouche> Nope too busy trying to sequence break then accidently sequence break and now lost.
[6:53:02] <%CAPSLOCKlive> This is the biggest Metroid overall, though, no?
[6:53:07] <+ScatFace> @Deasmeister it's a game, doesn't matter really as long as you enjoying it
[6:53:09] <+Issun135> 2d yes
[6:53:11] <Darren716> Eh Prime 3 is pretty big
[6:53:14] <mark1247> To be honest, it kinda easy to sequence break this game
[6:53:17] <omnishadeee> samus returns is longer i wouldnt say its bigger tho
[6:53:21] <mothdude> He sequence broke by accident as he was searching for items
[6:53:21] <+VictorVonLouche> @CAPSLOCKlive Dreads pretty short.
[6:53:21] <mark1247> Like I did. A lot of thing out of order
[6:53:23] <+Zenryoku21> first seeing this, how tight is this game?
[6:53:40] <DSD24> Its pretty tight
[6:53:45] <+D00msDayDan> it's tight as fuck
[6:53:49] <BlackermanZX> controls are great and game is amazing
[6:53:54] <gaminglink25> damn tight
[6:54:00] <+ScatFace> the game exceeded my expectations
[6:54:11] <Burncoat> Oh shit Woolie's already up to here?
[6:54:11] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[6:54:17] <double_zr_tap> you really do be shmoving tho
[6:54:19] <+VictorVonLouche> 5 hour liar
[6:54:20] <penitentpendant> Collectibles go up
[6:54:20] <Shwepie> A 3 hour tour?
[6:54:25] <BlackermanZX> thats metroid for ya
[6:54:32] <+HakureiIllusion> Samus Returns is padded out way too long
[6:54:33] <+Zenryoku21> it looks like it. that killbot was fun looking
[6:54:35] <+ShutUpAceyP> another 3 hours and he'll beat the game
[6:54:37] <miucsa51> that's part of metroid
[6:54:43] <+ScatFace> it's an improvement over samus returns in everyway, the game has some of the best boss fights
[6:54:45] <$razielhex> Woolie the Liar spent 5 hours looking for pies to steal out of sequence
[6:54:46] <penitentpendant> Got to see EMMI's Anti Air tech, at least
[6:54:54] <+Jonesman64> WAIT.. you're supposed to get the wave beam after this one?
[6:54:56] <Darren716> Ohh yeah here
[6:54:56] <+shootbang_exe> is he planning to beat the game tonight or another session?
[6:54:58] <%FenixSeraph> Dread going back to basics
[6:55:03] <mark1247> I did the same thing woolie at the end, explore for 2 hours before the end @woolieversus
[6:55:06] <Aydarkzero> funnel monkaS
[6:55:17] <Agarciahunter> Maybe tonight.
[6:55:19] <+ScatFace> best look at the map to see where the item is
[6:55:27] <+ScatFace> it should look like a morph ball on the map
[6:55:42] <%LastHazzerd> god Samus' suit looks great
[6:55:56] <+rahunin> not yet
[6:55:57] <+VictorVonLouche> Is woolie losing it, what is he doing?
[6:56:00] <+tsamxxx> to think that castlevania lords of shadow would eventually lead to this
[6:56:08] <$razielhex> @VictorVonLouche he wants those missiles
[6:56:09] <Agarciahunter> Overthinking it
[6:56:11] <+ScatFace> that tank needs the cross bomb
[6:56:15] <%Prevot> he could get it right now
[6:56:16] <+ScatFace> rofl
[6:56:20] <Darren716> Maybe a new power would help
[6:56:30] <JacknZack27> Oh. This is how I got that.
[6:56:36] <omnishadeee> ur on the wrong side
[6:56:46] <BlackermanZX> its on the other side
[6:56:48] <%Prevot> you can totally ballpark those missiles
[6:56:49] <Shwepie> Trapped
[6:56:54] <mark1247> Other side
[6:56:54] <+HakureiIllusion> This entire area is hell to navigate around
[6:56:58] <%Prevot> ball spark*
[6:57:00] <+D00msDayDan> hey chat tell me how to get to that storm missile box because i can't figure it out
[6:57:13] <shillelaghrod> this one took me a while, don't backseat unless he asks tho
[6:57:14] <omnishadeee> @D00msDayDan go to the room below with the oneway door it has the targets
[6:57:15] <gaminglink25> wrong side
[6:57:17] <3Xgilly> you can place 6 of any color
[6:57:26] <+D00msDayDan> thx
[6:57:31] <+ScatFace> @D00msDayDan you get to it from the other side if I remember it correctly
[6:58:09] <glass_marcus> Like 2 hours
[6:58:10] <Shwepie> Under 1:55.
[6:58:10] <+Kiaayo> under two hours
[6:58:10] <HyperionXV> Sub 2 hours.
[6:58:10] <Bananassassin> 1:43 iirc
[6:58:12] <amritadyne> 1h44
[6:58:13] <+rahunin> like 2 hrs
[6:58:14] <+ShutUpAceyP> under 2 hours
[6:58:14] <omnishadeee> 1:43 i think
[6:58:14] <double_zr_tap> 2 hours and 30 min
[6:58:16] <%Dr00_PhD> Like 1:44
[6:58:17] <+Issun135> its already under 1.5 hours
[6:58:17] <BlackermanZX> under 2 hours
[6:58:18] <double_zr_tap> oh
[6:58:18] <Treasure_Vault> any% is sub 2 hours
[6:58:23] <Burncoat> I don't understand the respawn timers
[6:58:26] <+ScatFace> there it is
[6:58:27] <DSD24> Boss time?
[6:58:28] <double_zr_tap> dam them peeps are fast
[6:58:29] <$razielhex> 1:55
[6:58:33] <omnishadeee> people are discovering new tech and breaks every day tho
[6:58:38] <+VictorVonLouche> OH THIS FUCKER
[6:58:39] <shillelaghrod> Oatsngoats said it was 1:33, he just got a 1:44 IIRC
[6:58:43] <%ChoculaUltra> damn thats fast
[6:58:45] <+VictorVonLouche> Hated this part
[6:59:15] <mister_z_1994> Have fun in there Woolie LUL
[6:59:20] <%Deft_Thought> Dang, he spikey now
[6:59:21] <+ScatFace> this boss has to be the worst boss for me until I learned how to dodge the homing attacking
[6:59:28] <$razielhex> bullet hellish
[6:59:45] <Darren716> I hated this boss until I realized you could cross him up overhead
[6:59:57] <+VictorVonLouche> Woolies gonna die at this rate
[6:59:57] <Shwepie> @Burncoat Respawns happen when a spot reloads only. Seems like the game only keeps the current room and the adjacent room loaded.
[7:00:01] <Darren716> He's got it
[7:00:05] <+ShutUpAceyP> how did i not realize i could slide under it smh
[7:00:06] <DoctorMulholland> This was the least bossy-feeling boss in the game for me. I can imagine it being a nightmare on a low E-tank run though.
[7:00:15] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Nier Jr.
[7:00:34] <thisisacoolguy> Important to note that Storm missiles do less damage than normal missiles unless you get all the locks.
[7:00:40] <amritadyne> @Burncoat not entirely true, the game sometimes loads enemies back in on a timer, noticeable when attempting certain shinespark puzzles for a long time
[7:00:40] <Burncoat> @Burncoat Yeah but I've gone back and forth between two rooms only and still got enemies respawning
[7:00:44] <Darren716> good shit
[7:00:45] <penitentpendant> Nice you can cheese him by just jumping over him
[7:00:58] <+Issun135> you can also shine spark this boss as does its first slam attack if you build speed boost as it spwans
[7:00:58] <Darren716> X Bomb
[7:00:58] <DSD24> Ooof
[7:01:02] <Qsmash_> that was almost super embarrassing
[7:01:02] <$razielhex> METROID X BOMB
[7:01:03] <BlackermanZX> good shit
[7:01:05] <+ShutUpAceyP> CROSS FIRE
[7:01:05] <double_zr_tap> you did it!
[7:01:06] <sirjames079> Clutch!
[7:01:07] <DSD24> Down to the wire there
[7:01:07] <%RealThiele> X-Bomb
[7:01:08] <R_Blaze> Bloody Cross

[7:01:33] <DoctorMulholland> I botched a core X or two in Fusion. Hell of a stupid way to die once the real fight is functionally over
[7:01:33] <+VictorVonLouche> He skipped the important tutorial

[7:01:36] <@Menitta> thats a cool animation
[7:01:37] <%HollowedIdjit> aren't you supposed to get this earlier?
[7:01:43] <+D00msDayDan> oh don't you worry woolie
[7:01:44] <+VictorVonLouche> @HollowedIdjit yes
[7:01:45] <SlimeSlimeSlime> GG
[7:01:45] <Darren716> Yeah, bit of a let down huh
[7:01:46] <rosemon5001> that one mistake backseaters hate it LUL brucegGoose
[7:01:46] <%Namillus> Woolie sequence broke to the Wave Beam
[7:01:46] <+thelovingfool> youll get there
[7:01:47] <%AlteisenReiseZ> :) :) :)
[7:01:48] <Asuterisuku> You are.
[7:01:50] <%RealThiele> shutup chat
[7:01:54] <+Artemis_Scowl> :)
[7:01:55] <%HollowedIdjit> ah right
[7:01:58] <+NeonNobleKalzeria> he doesn't know
[7:01:59] <Tham1k> Welp too bad :)
[7:02:02] <BlackermanZX> too bad
[7:02:03] <+VictorVonLouche> Woolie the crossbomb propels you if you waited for the tutorial
[7:02:08] <powerprotoman> well its called cross bomb not power bomb woolie
[7:02:09] <Darren716> Yeah they replaced the power bomb with something new
[7:02:18] <Agarciahunter> Launches you sideways too
[7:02:28] <Tham1k> Bold of nintendo to replace it
[7:02:44] <+thelovingfool> watch the tutorial next time
[7:02:44] <pi_in_the_sci> side launch with bombs
[7:02:47] <penitentpendant> Ah, enforced tutorial
[7:02:52] <jumpyhugs> hehehehehehehe
[7:02:55] <SunsetJack> Watch the cross bomb video lol
[7:03:04] <KasiCrafter> I like these rooms since they FORCE you to learn
[7:03:05] <+ScatFace> he knows
[7:03:12] <+ScatFace> give the fucker a moment
[7:03:12] <%LastHazzerd> I C
[7:03:13] <+VictorVonLouche> At least it didn't take 2 hours this time
[7:03:14] <jumpyhugs> eyyyy
[7:03:14] <pi_in_the_sci> now you can get some stuff
[7:03:16] <Burncoat> You give yourself some succ
[7:03:19] <+Atomic_ColliderSG> we bomber man now
[7:03:26] <Darren716> You can sit on it and it'll propell you
[7:03:28] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Live and learn~
[7:03:49] <$NitronStreams> Bomb jumping but sideways
[7:03:50] <+NeonNobleKalzeria> it's a shame you get the cross bomb so late because it could've had lots of fun puzzles imo
[7:03:51] <+VictorVonLouche> You don't but w/e
[7:03:51] <+HakureiIllusion> Near the edge but not directly on the corner
[7:03:55] <+ScatFace> or just put the cross bomb behind you and move a bit forward
[7:03:56] <+Atomic_ColliderSG> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[7:03:59] <%Namillus> It's a positioning thing, you get pushed relative to the bomb
[7:04:08] <KasiCrafter> I think being right on TOP of the bomb is what keeps you still
[7:04:15] <BlackermanZX> gotta sliiighlty move to the left or right
[7:04:24] <+VictorVonLouche> And didn't open the door again lol
[7:04:30] <Burncoat> I love the gravity suit so much
[7:04:30] <+shootbang_exe> wait no open the door
[7:04:30] <+HakureiIllusion> Woolie nearing endgame

[7:04:37] <essence_of_lariatto> this is the engdame
[7:04:38] <powerprotoman> you say alternate path
[7:04:38] <+ShutUpAceyP> here we go
[7:04:40] <Louie_Salmon> "Alternate"
[7:04:43] <Deasmeister> It also work as an auto bomb jump

[7:05:07] <redwidow1358> You say 30 minutes max but what about that final boss though
[7:05:11] <+ajwinky> depends on if he wants to go back for more items or not

[7:12:40] <DevinMayCry> Acceptable big
[7:12:40] <+HakureiIllusion> This Power Bomb feels soooooo good

[7:12:50] <+VictorVonLouche> Time to BIRD UP to BIRD THEM DOWN
[7:12:52] <%Namillus> @ShutUpAceyP Cross Bombs are more a movement tool so it makes sense
[7:12:56] <DevinMayCry> This is one of the things from Other M they did right was power pombs
[7:12:59] <Gelphaze> becoming more Metroid then human.
[7:13:04] <+Jonesman64> Now I can actually ask why can't metroid crawl?
[7:13:05] <Alzero83> Mercury Steam doing it
[7:13:09] <%Prevot> drowning in powerups
[7:13:09] <DeltaD36> very powerful
[7:13:09] <Darren716> She's stocked and locked
[7:13:10] <+Parrish_broadnax> and shes just gonna forget it in the next game
[7:13:13] <+Issun135> Diffusion beam is another other M item
[7:13:14] <$razielhex> this is mostly her normal shit
[7:13:16] <+ajwinky> She's on metROIDs
[7:13:19] <%HollowedIdjit> you are a military bunker and a half of munitions
[7:13:21] <Darren716> Boom
[7:13:24] <TheSaltminer> Power Bomb, Samus gonna Kevin Nash some fools
[7:13:27] <jumpyhugs> Samus is better at running and spinning in a ball, fight me
[7:13:27] <+Issun135> other m did alot of things right, story presentation was not one
[7:13:27] <omnishadeee> this power bomb is based off the other m power bomb too
[7:13:28] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Dare I say, Samus' most stacked arsenal?
[7:13:30] <$NitronStreams> FUCK YES
[7:13:34] <DeltaD36> literally a nuke
[7:13:35] <R_Blaze> Power to the Earth!
[7:13:37] <heartlesshealer> she is the most powerful warrior in the galaxy <3
[7:13:38] <DoctorMulholland> That's a power bomb alright.
[7:13:41] <+geminitengu> Nuke them all
[7:13:41] <DSD24> This is Samus at her most buff
[7:13:47] <%Namillus> Samus is The Ultimate Warrior.
[7:13:49] <+ScatFace> she is metroid
[7:13:51] <R_Blaze> Light it up
[7:13:54] <+ShutUpAceyP> nuke them all from orbit. it's the only way to be sure
[7:13:56] <%Namillus> Or, in the original Chozo: "The Metroid."
[7:14:00] <+VictorVonLouche> Dont waste them might soft lock lol
[7:14:01] <+geminitengu> Become the baby

[7:14:09] <BlackermanZX> you got some upgrades already so its nice
[7:14:09] <DoctorMulholland> Say what you will about Other M but Adam was right to want to keep those beasts locked down in that.
[7:14:16] <+VictorVonLouche> Chozo fighters!
[7:14:17] <Agarciahunter> Since you got it early you strted out with more
[7:14:18] <%Prevot> now its everything else that should be dreading you

[7:15:01] <%Double_Tap_That> BFB9000
[7:15:07] <+HakureiIllusion> Prime and Fusion had power-bomb-the-glass-tunnel moments too
[7:15:15] <Bananassassin> Shlurp bombs
[7:15:18] <%HollowedIdjit> here they teach you that all your problems can be solved by dropping a nuke, Gandhi was right
[7:15:21] <Shwepie> I wonder if you could do Crystal Flash in this...
[7:15:23] <%BisoromiBear> gotta love a fuck this room button
[7:15:23] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[7:15:23] <Asuterisuku> Zero Mission too.
[7:15:24] <redwidow1358> Prime 2 has a tunnel you bomb as well
[7:15:29] <+Lightning_Goat> I love that you get pickups from enemies like 2 rooms over after using a Power Bomb
[7:15:31] <jumpyhugs> wai... nevermind
[7:15:39] <Aeroallways> you just killed shit in another room btw
[7:15:43] <Asuterisuku> It's every game post Super.
[7:15:46] <+ShutUpAceyP> i don't think fusion has a tunnel?
[7:15:48] <+kogathemaster> is like the Fusion bo0mb, that attract X
[7:15:50] <%HollowedIdjit> yo this one's weird
[7:15:51] <Darren716> Except Prime 3
[7:15:51] <+ShutUpAceyP> maybe in sec 4?
[7:15:56] <+ScatFace> FUCK YEAH IT"S TIME
[7:16:00] <IceyCone> this speed booster is weird yeah

[7:16:35] <+minibarfs_> Damn that vaccine is doing wonders
[7:16:37] <%Prevot> FULFILL YOUR DESTINY
[7:16:37] <DevinMayCry> NOW YOU ARE stronge enough
[7:16:37] <jumpyhugs> @Burncoat but maybe there are teeth
[7:16:38] <+geminitengu> Samus now you are the metroid!
[7:16:40] <puluxor> Subtle.
[7:16:41] <Agarciahunter> This means that calling Samus "Metroid" isn't wrong now technically.
[7:16:41] <Treasure_Vault> Sky castle?
[7:16:41] <%Double_Tap_That> Metroid Trigger
[7:16:41] <%RealThiele> Samus fufill your destiny
[7:16:42] <BlackermanZX> now you are up on the tier list
[7:16:43] <+ScatFace> face vergil at the top of the tower
[7:16:43] <Shwepie> Samus "The Baby" Aran
[7:16:44] <%TheBensonator_> CANT ESCAPE FROM CROSSING FATE
[7:16:48] <%HollowedIdjit> Samus can no longer eat ice cream.
[7:16:50] <+HakureiIllusion> We really were the Metroid Dread all along
[7:16:51] <%GeneralSCPatton> Why can't Metroid crawl?
[7:16:56] <IceyCone> no longer allowed to have ice in her drinks
[7:17:00] <%LastHazzerd> i can't believe the old jokes are now real
[7:17:00] <zentzen> now she is the metroid
[7:17:01] <glass_marcus> you are now cool enough to fight that dashing all powerful birdchad
[7:17:04] <%fetrigon> Samus is Metroid
[7:17:05] <+D00msDayDan> that's like being weak to bullets, is that a new weakness
[7:17:07] <jumpyhugs> always has to wear a sweater
[7:17:15] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Look at me.... I am the Metroid now.
[7:17:16] <jorniev> get strong samus. then well settle the matter
[7:17:17] <+ajwinky> now if you call her metroid you're technically correct
[7:17:18] <+Kiaayo> she's been weak to ice since fusion
[7:17:19] <%LastHazzerd> Samus is the reason this series can still be called Metroid
[7:17:21] <omnishadeee> woolie u have wave beam remember
[7:17:22] <%Lord_Rockman> i hate this puzzle
[7:17:26] <+VictorVonLouche> YOU DID THIS you chose to go through the door
[7:17:26] <+ShutUpAceyP> open the door from the outside?
[7:17:28] <%RealThiele> metroid cant crawl
[7:17:31] <%Prevot> this one is easy
[7:17:32] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> only one shot, then you have to go all the way back around for no reason
[7:17:32] <heartlesshealer> speed, keep, bomb, ball?
[7:17:33] <BlackermanZX> this one is not that hard
[7:17:34] <+unreso> wave beam
[7:17:35] <%HollowedIdjit> Samus can not survive Canada
[7:17:40] <essence_of_lariatto> yeah there
[7:17:41] <Tham1k> Metroid can suck
[7:17:49] <+VictorVonLouche> Should have recharged first
[7:17:51] <essence_of_lariatto> are a couple really dickishly place doors in this game
[7:17:52] <heartlesshealer> I admit I never looked at that particular puzzle
[7:17:53] <%GeneralSCPatton> I love how common power bombs are now
[7:18:09] <jumpyhugs> bwomp
[7:18:10] <%HollowedIdjit> yeah if you 100% the game you sit on like 15 of them
[7:18:14] <chippybippers> this one's simple it's just annoying they make you take the loop
[7:18:18] <IceyCone> this one's pretty annoying cause of that yeah
[7:18:18] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> yeah it's dumb
[7:18:19] <+VictorVonLouche> Yeah so dont fuck up
[7:18:21] <$razielhex> didn't gene do this on twitch?
[7:18:24] <BlackermanZX> yeah gotta do it in one sit
[7:18:24] <marumariball> this ones silly
[7:18:25] <jumpyhugs> annoying
[7:18:25] <Aydarkzero> Does not open from this side LUL
[7:18:26] <%Prevot> don't fuck.up
[7:18:28] <+spawnzie> ya this ones rude
[7:18:29] <+flyscho95> jusut shoot it from the bottom
[7:18:32] <SunsetJack> You can open it from the outside.
[7:18:39] <%GeneralSCPatton> And they confirmed the theory that an implosion is why it always sucked the X towards it.
[7:18:40] <Aeroallways> it's rude but it is easy
[7:18:48] <jumpyhugs> 100% speedrun reset point at the end of the game NotLikeThis
[7:18:57] <+SouLucha> NotLikeThis
[7:19:00] <+geminitengu> imagine not getting it first try
[7:19:01] <JacknZack27> You can open it from the bottom so its fine
[7:19:02] <powerprotoman> this ones really easy if you know the quick speed boost trick
[7:19:03] <%Prevot> LUL
[7:19:09] <jumpyhugs> it don't
[7:19:11] <Bananassassin> You can just do it from that ledge on the left
[7:19:12] <+NeonNobleKalzeria> it doesn't come back

[7:19:20] <Goergorion> super bomb blocks do not come back
[7:19:20] <Shwepie> They didn't want people going backwards, but they could have just made a power bomb wall instead of having a one way door.
[7:19:22] <+SouLucha> Wave Beam.
[7:19:23] <omnishadeee> u have the distance at that doors ledge
[7:19:27] <+VictorVonLouche> You have the space
[7:19:30] <+ForlornCarton> There is enough room up there
[7:19:33] <+ajwinky> its barely enough space
[7:19:35] <jumpyhugs> @Parrish_broadnax LUL yeah he had to do it the 'easy' way Kappa
[7:19:39] <BlackermanZX> therenah theres enough space
[7:19:40] <+VictorVonLouche> Stop trying to big brain simple puzzles
[7:19:46] <lonosis47> How... How has woolie still not beat this game
[7:19:48] <trigunstar26> It‚Äôs tricky but you can still do it
[7:19:52] <gaminglink25> won't come back
[7:19:53] <omnishadeee> ?
[7:19:54] <pepinillomaton> hmmmmmmm
[7:19:56] <%GeneralSCPatton> You have exactly enough space up there sbfpSetIn
[7:19:59] <+geminitengu> Woolie please look with our eyes
[7:20:12] <+Parrish_broadnax> I wonder what his gameplan is lol
[7:20:12] <BlackermanZX> that one way door is just mean
[7:20:13] <Agarciahunter> just run before you open it
[7:20:14] <shillelaghrod> the door locks behind you chat
[7:20:38] <%HollowedIdjit> there is not
[7:20:39] <+SouLucha> Always take a moment to look at the puzzle and plan a route...
[7:20:47] <omnishadeee> there is enough clearance on the oneway door side
[7:20:50] <shillelaghrod> try the next room woolie :)
[7:20:50] <%GeneralSCPatton> Classic Woolie always making assumptions and then never testing them
[7:20:51] <+VictorVonLouche> Just skip then, clearly not enough room
[7:20:55] <pepinillomaton> think woolie think
[7:20:56] <shillelaghrod> ass umption
[7:20:56] <gaminglink25> LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL
[7:20:59] <+VictorVonLouche> Bad game design
[7:21:00] <lonosis47> Every streamer i watch has beaten this game and some of them started AFTER woolie
[7:21:10] <Qsmash_> literally impossible 0/10 shit gaem
[7:21:11] <jumpyhugs> @VictorVonLouche disagree
[7:21:12] <+ajwinky> there's enough space
[7:21:12] <BlackermanZX> no
[7:21:12] <+Parrish_broadnax> the sight of samus running into a room gun at the ready and just coming to a full stop, and leaving just gets me every time
[7:21:14] <DeltaD36> stays brioken I think
[7:21:17] <Shwepie> Way easier if you don't kill the power bomb blocks.
[7:21:20] <omnishadeee> u dont need to reload the map
[7:21:20] <BlackermanZX> theres enough sace in there
[7:21:20] <+Raspada_Ryner> There's enough space
[7:21:24] <+Yukasmarvin> If you start running before opening the door there is more then enough space to run
[7:21:25] <pepinillomaton> Nah, you dont need to reload the map, it stays gone forever
[7:21:25] <amritadyne> power bomb blocks never respawn
[7:21:25] <Agarciahunter> They dont come back
[7:21:26] <powerprotoman> so if you run- turn around mid run- and activate speed booster as you turn you get speed booster out faster
[7:21:26] <Aeroallways> they don't come back
[7:21:27] <+MinoMiushi> Just use the save point hallway and use the wave beam
[7:21:28] <NiniGiovanini> how could this be!
[7:21:29] <pi_in_the_sci> Thoser blocks never come back
[7:21:30] <+geminitengu> Woolieits ok
[7:21:30] <IceyCone> just barely enough, but its annoying
[7:21:36] <MmmokayByron> Woolie is overthinking, isn't he chat?
[7:21:40] <trigunstar26> It‚Äôs doable. I did it after blowing the bridge and I‚Äôm no speedrunner
[7:21:41] <+VictorVonLouche> Woolie would it kill you to just try a shine spark from that ledge.
[7:21:42] <Agarciahunter> Yes
[7:21:43] <lonosis47> why woolie..._
[7:21:44] <%Dr00_PhD> as always
[7:21:44] <pepinillomaton> You can solve it, you have just not found the solution
[7:21:44] <Make_me_mad> I love how little hesitation samus has about using this new power. She realizes she now has a sick Metroid based power drain attack, and immediately decides that's radical and keeps doing it.
[7:21:45] <AzaroRequiem> yes he is
[7:21:54] <gaminglink25> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[7:21:57] <+D00msDayDan> Doesn‚Äôt the one way doot stay open after a point?
[7:21:58] <+ajwinky> start on one side of the door, end before the drop
[7:22:03] <omnishadeee> @MmmokayByron he has enough distance from the edge of the eldge in front of him
[7:22:04] <BlackermanZX> its from the left ledge
[7:22:05] <+Raspada_Ryner> I thought there wasn't enough space initially, but speed boost doesn't actually require that much to start up
[7:22:06] <%HollowedIdjit> @Make_me_mad "Oh that's how it feels!"
[7:22:07] <+flyscho95> it's really east from the save room if you open the door with the wave beam
[7:22:09] <pi_in_the_sci> try it on the straight through the one way door
[7:22:10] <shillelaghrod> @MmmokayByron Yeah but it's still kinda confusing and the shinespark blocks don't work like they did before
[7:22:11] <+Keanotix> I remember how I did this now, it is a brain teaser
[7:22:14] <+ScatFace> Woolie's over thinking it
[7:22:16] <jumpyhugs> @D00msDayDan nuh uh
[7:22:23] <powerprotoman> @D00msDayDan it stays open long enough for you to go back in if you dont get speed boster
[7:22:23] <%Namillus> @Make_me_mad After a little bit of "wait why do I instinctively want to grab stuff with my weaponless hand"
[7:22:23] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[7:22:24] <+MinoMiushi> Woolie has it backwards
[7:22:27] <Agarciahunter> it
[7:22:30] <+VictorVonLouche> He's 1000 IQing it again damn it
[7:22:32] <Darren716> @ScatFace What? Never
[7:22:35] <Agarciahunter> s the hallway all over again
[7:22:41] <%LastHazzerd> these the best parts
[7:22:45] <shillelaghrod> dear jeebus :(
[7:22:52] <omnishadeee> lol who said woolie was gonna get to the end of the game in 30 mins
[7:23:01] <%Prevot> LUL
[7:23:04] <NiniGiovanini> Woolie, you have enough room, just run
[7:23:05] <lonosis47> Yeaaahhhh no woolie
[7:23:09] <+geminitengu> wolie please
[7:23:13] <+Issun135> You have 8 directional shine spark in this game
[7:23:14] <+ScatFace> these guys are butthurt that we are getting more content
[7:23:18] <+VictorVonLouche> Woolie just try and SPRINT from that ledge
[7:23:26] <jumpyhugs> @ScatFace ^^^^
[7:23:27] <Treasure_Vault> more content makes me more content
[7:23:29] <shillelaghrod> @ScatFace this is not content, this is pain
[7:23:33] <trigunstar26> You gotta do it from the data room just next to the door
[7:23:35] <%GeneralSCPatton> I wonder which god delivered the divine revelation that there wasn't enough space. Like, who even needs eyes?
[7:23:36] <+VictorVonLouche> many things to learn from do, not think.
[7:23:37] <%Dr00_PhD> pain is content
[7:23:39] <NiniGiovanini> he could probably do it from the save room too
[7:23:40] <lonosis47> Woolie is NOT beating this today
[7:23:40] <pepinillomaton> If only you could shot trough walls
[7:23:43] <+geminitengu> Mabe Woolie will figure it out
[7:23:49] <bleugh> s p e e d
[7:23:49] <omnishadeee> YO
[7:23:51] <%Prevot> I got pretty used to speed boosting with minimal space in this game
[7:23:52] <+alternative_flu> lol good effort woolie
[7:23:55] <BlackermanZX> there ya go
[7:23:55] <+geminitengu> maybe we will sit for for 4 hours

[7:24:54] <BlackermanZX> hey remember super metroid
[7:24:54] <%RealThiele> bye nostalgia
[7:24:56] <Bananassassin> Once you get power bombs you can either 100% the game or go to the end, either way.

[7:25:41] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> @lonosis47 He's almost done
[7:25:41] <double_zr_tap> Super metroid call back!
[7:25:44] <powerprotoman> @lonosis47 you want to bet money?
[7:25:47] <BlackermanZX> this game loves super metroid so much it does the thing 3 times
[7:25:55] <%wardogleader15> wardogleader15 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! Hey! 15 Months, just popping in, how are you enjoying Dread?
[7:25:58] <trigunstar26> I didn‚Äôt know you could reread the dialogues until after beating the game
[7:26:05] <+HakureiIllusion> Woolie basically just needs to walk into the final boss room at this point
[7:26:11] <chippybippers> was it a super metroid callback or a callback to the time fusion did a callback to super metroid
[7:26:15] <lonosis47> @powerprotoman  okay i bet 200 channel points
[7:26:21] <%HollowedIdjit> the hell is this
[7:26:25] <+ScatFace> @HakureiIllusion vergil wont take 1 try to beat though
[7:26:35] <BlackermanZX> @chippybippers ...yes
[7:26:44] <jumpyhugs> bergil?
[7:26:50] <+geminitengu> Burgergil
[7:26:51] <%HyVoltxge> Damn Woolie's really far. Glad to see he's liking the game as much as I did
[7:26:52] <iamnotaparrot> birdgil
[7:26:52] <+VictorVonLouche> @HakureiIllusion Yes but he is going to press his face at a random wall thinking he can phase through it for another 3 hours just watch.
[7:26:55] <TheTakkster> this is the elevator you came in on
[7:26:59] <gaminglink25> birdgil
[7:27:01] <%HollowedIdjit> oh you can shoot up
[7:27:02] <Bananassassin> That's just for later
[7:27:03] <$razielhex> TREE OF LIFE
[7:27:06] <+HakureiIllusion> Oh it'll definitely take a ton of tries, but just saying, he's more or less done with the game and I doubt he'll stop for the night between tries
[7:27:06] <+ajwinky> it's just an alt way up
[7:27:14] <+geminitengu> imagine missing a door
[7:27:31] <BlackermanZX> damn almost
[7:27:33] <+ScatFace> or you know, look at the map if lost
[7:27:46] <shillelaghrod> very subtle secret
[7:27:47] <%HollowedIdjit> yo look at those Chozo Planes
[7:27:50] <HyMyNameIsMatt> Bread...

[7:28:08] <AngryAsian5> THE BOI
[7:28:09] <Darren716> You are all set I think
[7:28:12] <BlackermanZX> 201 missiles for the storm missile god
[7:28:13] <+ajwinky> hungry samus?
[7:28:15] <%HyVoltxge> 201 missiles, let's go
[7:28:17] <+DatAsuna> more than enough to kill anything that moves
[7:28:18] <%DeadManProp> DeadManProp subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! Yo, I just wanna say these streams are awesome and keep up the epic job! :)
[7:28:18] <%BisoromiBear> we comin

[7:28:31] <+ScatFace> fight the jobber
[7:28:35] <+alternative_flu> oh god this dude
[7:28:39] <+geminitengu> kill the jobber
[7:28:39] <%HollowedIdjit> look at this cool guy
[7:28:40] <pi_in_the_sci> superbomb him
[7:28:40] <Asuterisuku> I expect the coming fights to take a few tries.
[7:28:40] <%BisoromiBear> fuck yeah goldar
[7:28:40] <%HollowedIdjit> love him
[7:28:42] <TemperedSkull> Gold Torizo
[7:28:43] <%HyVoltxge> These Chozo jobbers are fun to fight
[7:28:45] <iamnotaparrot> max missiles is 275+10 from amiibo I think.
[7:28:49] <NiniGiovanini> golden jobber
[7:28:49] <+VictorVonLouche> Woolie does not know to parry
[7:29:02] <+ScatFace> amiibos give you extra missles?
[7:29:14] <Asuterisuku> And an exfre E tank
[7:29:16] <%RealThiele> amibos fill missiles and health once a day or something like that
[7:29:26] <IceyCone> only dread amiibos give more than max
[7:29:26] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1447814216103104512?t=FMN9Zf2S4JsthZvBIlfXDQ&s=19
[7:29:31] <+alternative_flu> @ScatFace some do and I think some give you extra life
[7:29:39] <+MagiKestral> gotta remember that moving parry
[7:29:43] <+geminitengu> earlyy?????
[7:29:43] <jumpyhugs> for those in chat, you gotta run up to the shield and smack it
[7:29:44] <+thelovingfool> i think you have to hit the shield physically
[7:29:45] <+VictorVonLouche> Run at him
[7:29:47] <essence_of_lariatto> that is a really delayed parry
[7:29:48] <+ScatFace> I don't know how I feel about that, every game that has amiibo support I just skip using the amiibos on
[7:29:48] <Bananassassin> You have to parry into the shield for that one iirc
[7:29:49] <DSD24> Maybe the dashing parry?
[7:29:53] <otterlyhyped> gotta be closer
[7:29:55] <+ScatFace> unless it unlocks extra content or characters
[7:30:04] <+VictorVonLouche> RUN AT HIM
[7:30:06] <+HakureiIllusion> Dash parry into the initial flash
[7:30:06] <pi_in_the_sci> get close
[7:30:07] <%Prevot> NotLikeThis
[7:30:07] <DoctorMulholland> ohhhhhhhhhhhhh
[7:30:07] <+spawnzie> you gotta hit the shield
[7:30:07] <+Parrish_broadnax> lol playin with ya food
[7:30:07] <Asuterisuku> Samus is Energy, her enemies are missiles.
[7:30:08] <Jiyairo> You just need to hit the shield
[7:30:10] <%RealThiele> sleepin
[7:30:12] <+NeonNobleKalzeria> the counter on the chozo makes like 0 sense
[7:30:12] <BlackermanZX> so close to glory
[7:30:13] <pepinillomaton> You gotta go hit him in the shield
[7:30:14] <+alternative_flu> DON'T GIVE IN WOOLIE GIVE HIM HELL
[7:30:14] <+Raspada_Ryner> Gotta parry into him
[7:30:16] <%fetrigon> dash  parry
[7:30:20] <+thelovingfool> flash kick
[7:30:21] <TheHardM> "Woolie, you need to HIT him."
[7:30:23] <%LastHazzerd> RIP the parry dream
[7:30:36] <jumpyhugs> y'all yellin like he's readin smh
[7:30:40] <TemperedSkull> vega shit
[7:30:41] <+alternative_flu> aw
[7:30:44] <%HyVoltxge> At least this one isn't a cinematic parry, we ain't missin much
[7:30:47] <%HollowedIdjit> you have to hit his shield when it flashes, not wait for the charge
[7:30:47] <BlackermanZX> that black goops hits a crapton
[7:30:48] <+geminitengu> rip
[7:30:48] <+Rolandknight> you have to hit the shield when it counter point shine
[7:30:48] <+VictorVonLouche> RIP using your mechanics in a fun way
[7:30:49] <TheHardM> @jumpyhugs But it's fun, though.
[7:30:49] <sirjames079> Anti air'd
[7:30:50] <%RealThiele> guess we get another parry try
[7:30:50] <+kogathemaster> 2 whole energy tanks per hit
[7:31:04] <+ScatFace> bet, last fight will take him over 10 tries
[7:31:06] <+thelovingfool> hes like the robots
[7:31:17] <jumpyhugs> @jumpyhugs I hear that
[7:31:43] <TheHardM> So close.
[7:31:46] <%RealThiele> blue
[7:31:47] <essence_of_lariatto> grapple point

[7:31:49] <iamnotaparrot> grapple
[7:31:50] <+geminitengu> oh yyou can rip the shield away huh
[7:31:51] <+HakureiIllusion> Woolie will (maybe) figure it out

[7:31:53] <iamnotaparrot> oof
[7:31:54] <BlackermanZX> ohhh grapple beam
[7:31:55] <shillelaghrod> he's totally not gonna notice it
[7:32:20] <TheHardM> Well, at least he gets it.
[7:32:30] <+MagiKestral> frankly it's not all that interesting an animation, anyway
[7:32:32] <IceyCone> to be fair max also failed to notice the blue
[7:32:33] <+ajwinky> I never got that one either
[7:32:38] <+spawnzie> there's no special animation so no it's not a big deal
[7:32:38] <%LastHazzerd> not enough games let you use ya grapple on enemies
[7:32:42] <Treasure_Vault> does super bomb do anything here?
[7:32:42] <+VictorVonLouche> Final boss is gonna be pure stress for the chat, calling it now.

[7:40:34] <+DatAsuna> use your final smash
[7:40:35] <LVL1_Scumbag> It's past your bedtime!
[7:40:35] <anuchallengertwitch> @jorniev he even has a taunt too
[7:40:35] <Led_Diire> You can't hurt him during this phase
[7:40:36] <+thelovingfool> hes so sick
[7:40:39] <+ScatFace> ded
[7:40:40] <miucsa51> YOU ARE NOT WORTHY AS MY OPPONENT

[7:40:46] <Shwepie> I slid under that full screen swipe, then found out watching someone else you can morph ball under it, and now I saw Woolie just crouch. Madness.
[7:40:47] <DSD24> Game over
[7:40:48] <+ShutUpAceyP> black hole bomb hurts
[7:40:48] <+MagiKestral> this is effectively Parry Time

[7:41:08] <pepinillomaton> Schum
[7:41:08] <redwidow1358> Pretty damn good for your first attempt tbh
[7:41:08] <DSD24> Too bad Smash is over now
[7:41:11] <+thelovingfool> samus just cant stop with daddy issues
[7:41:12] <R_Blaze> Big Bird has had enough of your crap
[7:41:14] <trigunstar26> Gold armor is invincible
[7:41:14] <emMmDeeKay> Samus has TWO DADS
[7:41:15] <jorniev> HE KEEPS the beam going to SLASH like a SWORD
[7:41:15] <MaroonedMoose> Raven Beak in Marvel when
[7:41:16] <+VictorVonLouche> You can skip
[7:41:16] <anuchallengertwitch> This mother squawker is SO God Damn Cool
[7:41:18] <+thelovingfool> first adam now this
[7:41:18] <+ShutUpAceyP> BIRDGIL FOR SMASH 5
[7:41:19] <$razielhex> Only Ridley can defeat him
[7:41:22] <%HollowedIdjit> Samus has four dads
[7:41:23] <Gelphaze> Lets fucking GO!
[7:41:24] <TemperedSkull> I've come to reclaim my power! You can't handle it
[7:41:26] <%Prevot> well not raised by
[7:41:27] <%HyVoltxge> Raven Beak should be in Smash 6. Legit
[7:41:27] <+spawnzie> Sakurai are we SURE we can't fit one more character?
[7:41:27] <+PA_august> Samus is a real grabag of DNA
[7:41:28] <+DatAsuna> not raised by, that was old bird
[7:41:29] <+MightyDuckShoes> @razielhex Kappa
[7:41:29] <anuchallengertwitch> @jorniev I know Right, He's So COOL
[7:41:31] <%HollowedIdjit> Her biological one, Old Bird, Gray Voice and this Fucker
[7:41:31] <+DatAsuna> and he's dead
[7:41:32] <%RealThiele> not raised by , but donated genes for
[7:41:32] <Aeroallways> Nah this is the deadbeat dad
[7:41:33] <%Prevot> just got his DNA
[7:41:33] <+agumon9000> She wasn't raised by Raven Break, just has his DNA
[7:41:34] <+HakureiIllusion> Not raised by, just one of the ones that gave her his DNA
[7:41:36] <jumpyhugs> I love watching a brain work
[7:41:37] <+DatAsuna> But chozo she got genes from
[7:41:37] <Led_Diire> NO, The Chozo that wiped EVERYONE out
[7:41:37] <BlackermanZX> actually the chozo that donated his dna
[7:41:38] <+rahunin> one of the DNA donar
[7:41:39] <+LazyAss24Seven> YEYEYE
[7:41:40] <+ScatFace> samus is a mutt
[7:41:41] <anuchallengertwitch> I gotta draw this dude
[7:41:42] <jorniev> NOT RAISED engenired
[7:41:44] <+PA_august> I think she was raised by another dude
[7:41:45] <+NickHatesSnow> Not raised but the one she's infused eith
[7:41:49] <peachy996> the whole time pretending to be Adam he was telling you you weren't shit and you couldn't fight Raven Beak because to him you weren't and you can't
[7:41:50] <+DatAsuna> her chozo dad is very dead
[7:41:51] <+ajwinky> I do like that the first time her computer starts telling her shit about obedience she's like 'I'm gonna shoot it'
[7:41:52] <DSD24> Raven Beak is a Zoner
[7:41:52] <+eanscrale> Just like Vergil!
[7:41:53] <slidshockingkrow> he's not "a" chozo, he's "the" chozo
[7:41:57] <%LastHazzerd> well, this explains why Adam never called you lady once ya got in the planet
[7:42:03] <$razielhex> super bombs can destroy the singularity
[7:42:05] <%RealThiele> Samus has the DNA of 5 things LUL
[7:42:11] <+PA_august> Woolie read the manga
[7:42:11] <pepinillomaton> Dhalsim ultra is annoying
[7:42:15] <+Parrish_broadnax> she a test tube baby
[7:42:17] <breadmeng> He provided data. he is only her gene-father
[7:42:20] <BlackermanZX> that punch can be parried
[7:42:20] <TheHardM> @RealThiele Samus has the DNA of everything.
[7:42:20] <mothdude> Adam: Wow Raven Beak is so cool and strong and has an 8-pack.
[7:42:23] <+ajwinky> Samus got the DNA of like half the galaxy by now
[7:42:24] <jumpyhugs> 4 missles
[7:42:26] <Led_Diire> It takes 4 missiles
[7:42:29] <%fetrigon> bomb
[7:42:29] <+thelovingfool> the ball takes 4 missles
[7:42:37] <+DatAsuna> He did bitch to a missile in the opening
[7:42:38] <anuchallengertwitch> @peachy996 Raven Beak as ADAM: Yeah Samus, you'll never beat Raven Beak, he can like, benchpress a planet and doesn't afraid of anything
[7:42:38] <shotgang86> man woolie still streaming?
[7:42:39] <%RealThiele> shes not a test tube baby the pirates really did kill her human colony and the chozo did save her, but then they scienced
[7:42:40] <Led_Diire> ALso, Storm Missile deals less damage than regular missiles
[7:42:40] <+LazyAss24Seven> wombo combo
[7:42:43] <Bananassassin> 4 missiles or 3 lock-ons iirc
[7:42:43] <+Keanotix> 4 missles or a fully charged storm missle
[7:42:44] <Shwepie> @peachy996 "I don't know if Chozo's have dicks, but if they do I bet that Raven Beak's gotta big one." -Adam
[7:42:45] <+spawnzie> regular beam is more effective imo
[7:42:47] <OldManDeckardCain> samus is literally ichigo from bleach kind of dna bullshit LUL
[7:42:48] <%GeneralSCPatton> Does uncharged beam do anything here?
[7:42:49] <%HyVoltxge> He'll figure it out, dw
[7:42:51] <+MightyDuckShoes> Did he turn his arm cannon into a lightsaber?!
[7:42:54] <$razielhex> CRUSHER
[7:42:56] <DSD24> Man the liver shot
[7:43:00] <%HollowedIdjit> @MightyDuckShoes he sure does
[7:43:00] <TemperedSkull> he's got mad corner pressure
[7:43:01] <DoctorMulholland> Power bomb's the best way to deal with the black hole, provided you have the distance to safel charage
[7:43:02] <+Raspada_Ryner> That punch is parryable btw
[7:43:04] <peachy996> It's a smart way to do Kai Leng writing
[7:43:04] <TheHardM> @MightyDuckShoes He shot a laser beam and swung with it.
[7:43:07] <+ScatFace> attempt 3
[7:43:07] <ELFucilaNeroIV> there is another parry point outside of taunt. hopefully he notices
[7:43:08] <shotgang86> power bomb
[7:43:09] <+MinoMiushi> black hole is 4 missiles
[7:43:09] <+RedKazoo> damn this boss is sick
[7:43:09] <pepinillomaton> This guy is no joke!
[7:43:11] <+R_BChe> corner pressure crazuy
[7:43:11] <+thelovingfool> 4 missles
[7:43:11] <themightycation> This boss is tough
[7:43:12] <iamnotaparrot> power bomb black holes
[7:43:13] <emMmDeeKay> 4
[7:43:13] <omnishadeee> power bomb insta kills black hole
[7:43:14] <shotgang86> power bomb for black hole
[7:43:15] <XuriScratch> Power bomb the black hole
[7:43:15] <Darren716> Missiles are legit for the hole
[7:43:16] <HyMyNameIsMatt> 4 missles
[7:43:16] <miucsa51> How tall is raven beak?
[7:43:17] <+VictorVonLouche> Missile everything
[7:43:17] <ManfredA> use 4 storm missiles
[7:43:19] <+alternative_flu> the power bomb seemed to work really well against it
[7:43:19] <emMmDeeKay> SHIN missiles
[7:43:20] <+eldrinos> good final boss is good
[7:43:20] <%wardogleader15> blackhole i used Power bomb for
[7:43:20] <Asuterisuku> Death number 2
[7:43:20] <ManfredA> power bomb is overkill
[7:43:21] <%RealThiele> 4 missiles or POWAR
[7:43:21] <jumpyhugs> @spawnzie 'tis, but missles are comfy for me
[7:43:22] <TheAzureOracle> The black hole takes exactly 4 missiles
[7:43:23] <BlackermanZX> 4 storm missles work too
[7:43:24] <Darren716> Wait you can bomb it too?
[7:43:25] <+ScatFace> woolie will hit the 20 death mark here
[7:43:25] <fairore> i bet hes hi teir
[7:43:27] <breadmeng> Raven Beak was larping as ADAM and hyped himself up LUL
[7:43:28] <+thelovingfool> no save the power bombs
[7:43:28] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[7:43:29] <pepinillomaton> He actually did it before
[7:43:31] <+NickHatesSnow> 4 missles beat hole
[7:43:31] <+MinoMiushi> regular shots ironically work on him though
[7:43:31] <thisisacoolguy> Why would you waste power bombs on the black hole when 4 missiles kill it lmao
[7:43:33] <emMmDeeKay> or at least 3 lock ons
[7:43:34] <+VictorVonLouche> Storm missiles are a trap just regular
[7:43:34] <Alzero83> Brozo Birdgil aint no punk bitch
[7:43:36] <+ajwinky> I just soaked the black hole every time LUL
[7:43:40] <%RealThiele> yea Adam was Lengposting himself up
[7:43:44] <+ajwinky> it's not a ton of damage so
[7:43:46] <%Prevot> Raven Beak looks like he's almost 4 meters tall
[7:43:47] <shillelaghrod> @VictorVonLouche storm missiles are goated wdym
[7:43:59] <+ajwinky> Raven Beak for Smash btw
[7:44:00] <%mitchteck> Try regular missles
[7:44:01] <+ScatFace> the black hole is great to get more  missles
[7:44:01] <+thelovingfool> if youre all the way in the corner you can take down the black hole
[7:44:07] <%Namillus> Storm Missiles are great but you need to bother with multiple locks
[7:44:07] <DSD24> I mean isn't Samus like 7 feet?
[7:44:09] <%HollowedIdjit> Samus is like 6'1 and Raven beak is twice her height. So yeah, 4 meters is about right.
[7:44:09] <miucsa51> KomodoHype
[7:44:13] <+Axle13j> This is awesome
[7:44:14] <anuchallengertwitch> @ajwinky Maybe Project M since Ultimate is done
[7:44:15] <breadmeng> yeah Chozo are mean, lanky bastards
[7:44:16] <+MightyDuckShoes> @breadmeng  "Wow Ravenbeak is pretty cool.. I wish he was my dad.. If A.I.s had dads.."
[7:44:17] <thisisacoolguy> Storm Missiles always do less damage unless you get all 4 locks on them.
[7:44:21] <jumpyhugs> Storm missles are great for those robo chozo
[7:44:26] <+geminitengu> Liver! PUNCH
[7:44:29] <IceyCone> I love that it was just raven beak praising himself all along, it's such a silly thing but completely fitting
[7:44:33] <+ScatFace> chozos are large and raven beak is considered big even in chozo standards
[7:44:37] <+thelovingfool> the stinger is a counter , but its fucking tight
[7:44:37] <+HakureiIllusion> Rush his ass
[7:44:39] <%HollowedIdjit> I think he's got feints on that too
[7:44:47] <%RealThiele> screw attack is technically the fastest weapon against the robo chozo once you get it
[7:44:50] <ELFucilaNeroIV> that stinger punch has so much impact to it
[7:44:52] <%LastHazzerd> a fight that demands engagement
[7:44:53] <BlackermanZX> you can parry gut punch
[7:44:56] <Darren716> btw, your attacks do nothing right now
[7:44:59] <anuchallengertwitch> @IceyCone Ikr, it's great. He's just talking himself up the whole game, I think that's a nice character thing
[7:45:05] <+geminitengu> I would not reccomend countering the stinger unless our desperate for a little health
[7:45:05] <Ronin_Remix> Plus Samus is over 6 feet tall
[7:45:11] <pi_in_the_sci> I think missiles aren't hurting him while he's orange
[7:45:24] <+Axle13j> oof
[7:45:24] <+HakureiIllusion> Nothing other than parry cutscenes hurt him when he's gold
[7:45:24] <+MinoMiushi> He can only be damaged by counters when golden
[7:45:25] <+geminitengu> he takes no damage when orange
[7:45:28] <%RealThiele> *TINK*
[7:45:29] <+thelovingfool> ye he can ONLY be attacked from counter
[7:45:29] <Darren716> He's invincible in this stage
[7:45:32] <+mecha_11> Is this a game where you can parry "everything"
[7:45:34] <+ShutUpAceyP> nothing hurts him when he's orange
[7:45:35] <pepinillomaton> It doesnt sound like its making damage huh? Hmmmmmm
[7:45:36] <BlackermanZX> you have to parry gut punch for actual damage
[7:45:36] <+ScatFace> I like how the first fight in cutscene you get during the intro sequence teaches you what to do in this phase
[7:45:47] <+MinoMiushi> THe stinger is also a parry
[7:45:48] <shotgang86> you need to counter that
[7:45:49] <+ajwinky> is there a way to get him to taunt>
[7:45:53] <%RealThiele> wall splat counter
[7:45:56] <+ALazo> time to land parries
[7:45:56] <TheHardM> @mecha_11 No, only what flashes white.
[7:46:00] <breadmeng> "He worships at the altar of power" is how the SoulCalibur announcer intros him
[7:46:04] <DSD24> Samus taking all these liver punches
[7:46:05] <jumpyhugs> you're a champ, Woolie!
[7:46:20] <DSD24> @breadmeng That's dead on
[7:46:20] <shotgang86> he will never leave this part he he doesnt counter him
[7:46:30] <%HollowedIdjit> all these frame perfect Parries against the EMMIs
[7:46:33] <+VictorVonLouche> missed it
[7:46:39] <anuchallengertwitch> Raven Beak after gut punching Samus: Come on Samus, learn better Neutral
[7:46:41] <$razielhex> his psycho crusher is intense
[7:46:47] <pi_in_the_sci> Maybe try to powerbomb him?
[7:46:53] <jumpyhugs> it's the red fist
[7:46:55] <+ScatFace> I hope he figures out the gut punk is counterable
[7:46:55] <shotgang86> dude
[7:46:58] <BlackermanZX> right after taunt he stingers iirc
[7:47:08] <%Prevot> "Come on Samus Aran, aren't you a fighting game player?"
[7:47:10] <peachy996> Man Samus has the coolest villains
[7:47:11] <DSD24> Look at this area
[7:47:18] <+VictorVonLouche> This is not an EMMI you can wait for the prompt
[7:47:18] <shotgang86> I think the man is tired, its 8 hours of streaming
[7:47:22] <anuchallengertwitch> @peachy996 She does
[7:47:30] <TheAzureOracle> Dude forget the concept of wasting missiles, you'll never run out
[7:47:34] <+Keanotix> you can counter the gut punch
[7:47:38] <+TaurusOxford> Parry that man! NotLikeThis
[7:47:39] <BlackermanZX> you can do it
[7:47:40] <+thelovingfool> parry or die
[7:47:47] <+VictorVonLouche> SHOOOT
[7:47:47] <+alternative_flu> I think he knows you can counter it
[7:47:49] <reonome> man that taunt
[7:47:49] <jumpyhugs> SHOOT
[7:47:49] <pi_in_the_sci> forgot to shoot
[7:47:50] <+HakureiIllusion> WOOLIE
[7:47:51] <+TaurusOxford> you have to shoot !
[7:47:52] <+AnthraxJohnson> Chozo more like Chodezo
[7:47:52] <BlackermanZX> dang
[7:47:53] <TheHardM> You have to shoot him at that point.
[7:47:54] <%Prevot> why no shoot
[7:47:54] <+kogathemaster> NotLikeThis
[7:48:00] <%GeneralSCPatton> psaBig yikers
[7:48:03] <pepinillomaton> He parried but was too worried in case of second parry
[7:48:05] <+ScatFace> alright, I'll come back in an hour at attempt 23
[7:48:05] <BlackermanZX> birdgil is not joke
[7:48:06] <Agarciahunter> Listen for the sound
[7:48:07] <+spawnzie> he probably expecting a third
[7:48:09] <%jinking79> god he had it too
[7:48:10] <anuchallengertwitch> This is basically him trying to teach her Royal Guard parries
[7:48:11] <RocketBarrel> Settle down chat. Let the man work
[7:48:12] <+Keanotix> all game you shoot after counter and NOW he fails to shoot
[7:48:17] <Shwepie> @TheAzureOracle I ran out the first time I hit phase 3 despite having 275. :(
[7:48:19] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Final Boss Wollie?
[7:48:21] <+VictorVonLouche> 5 hours of pointless stroking walls has done this.
[7:48:25] <shillelaghrod> @TheAzureOracle he literally is dealing 0 damage, not shooting anything is what he should be doing
[7:48:25] <jumpyhugs> I believe in protagonist
[7:48:28] <+ajwinky> can you also parry when he does it raw without the taunt>
[7:48:31] <iamnotaparrot> this is only try 2 and he already has this phase downloaded pretty much. good pace
[7:48:32] <+MagiKestral> I wonder why he's not countering the red one
[7:48:34] <+MinoMiushi> Woolie please I'm begging you parry the stinger

[7:50:26] <redwidow1358> You don't have what it takes to take the Rawk Hawk
[7:50:26] <+ScatFace> good run though, he learned phase 2
[7:50:27] <shotgang86> parry the dstinger
[7:50:28] <Maverick2736> SAIKO CRUSHA
[7:50:28] <$NitronStreams> AW MAN
[7:50:28] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[7:50:30] <DSD24> Can you feel the storm?
[7:50:30] <+TaurusOxford> you can parry his dash attack
[7:50:31] <+rahunin> this fight was anime as hell
[7:50:31] <%RealThiele> that psycho crusher deals like 200 damage
[7:50:31] <MmmokayByron> I remember some said last stream of how he betrayed his race for a jetpack, instead he betrayed them for wings
[7:50:32] <peachy996> Meanwhile Falco in the back taking notes
[7:50:34] <%HyVoltxge> FUCK that circle machine gun attack.
[7:50:35] <DSD24> Its coming
[7:50:35] <+Keanotix> morph ball psycho crusher
[7:50:35] <Asuterisuku> His whole moveset is Aeion powered.
[7:50:36] <anuchallengertwitch> Aight, Raven Beak? Favorite Metroid Villain. Ridley, you still got a special place at  no.2, but Raven Beak is my new favorite
[7:50:36] <chinelord> galacta knight looking mf
[7:50:36] <shotgang86> parry the stinger woolie
[7:50:36] <happy_void> Big Bird Power
[7:50:37] <Alzero83> solid first attempt
[7:50:38] <watts121> Birgil living up to the name
[7:50:40] <BlackermanZX> you got the phases down lets go
[7:50:40] <ELFucilaNeroIV> we got this
[7:50:41] <+thelovingfool> those horizals are a bitch sometimes, nices slides
[7:50:41] <themightycation> I think storm missiiles work on the orange barrier
[7:50:45] <+MagiKestral> funnily enough he's fighting like Ridley
[7:50:46] <+HakureiIllusion> Wallslam move has a parry prompt
[7:50:47] <+eldrinos> the sickest shit
[7:50:49] <$NitronStreams> Birgil For Smash
[7:50:49] <+TaurusOxford> @themightycation it doesn't.
[7:50:52] <iamnotaparrot> you're killing it dude
[7:50:52] <trigunstar26> The crazy part is that Chozo lost the ability to fly, so him even having wings makes him an even BIGGER genetic freak
[7:50:58] <+VictorVonLouche> Parrying the stinger will get you to that next phase super fast
[7:51:11] <anuchallengertwitch> @MagiKestral He's pretty much Ridley fully realized if they ever actually showed his character in game
[7:51:13] <peachy996> Raven Beak is def up there with Ridley and SA-X
[7:51:17] <jumpyhugs> someone P L E A S E  paste Storm Eagle's track over this fight
[7:51:18] <breadmeng> Raven Beak among the top 4 best Power Suit designs
[7:51:22] <%HollowedIdjit> Looking at Raven Beak really gives you an idea of how easily the Chozo could have stomped everyone if they hadn't stopped.
[7:51:25] <+LazyAss24Seven> nice
[7:51:32] <Alzero83> i think the regular blasts do more damage during the cinematics
[7:51:36] <+MisterAvry> this fight is fkn raw
[7:51:36] <+VictorVonLouche> PARRY
[7:51:48] <breadmeng> IF that suit has such a label
[7:51:50] <+TaurusOxford> Parry the Stinger Punch! NotLikeThis
[7:52:02] <%RealThiele> hes figuring it out
[7:52:03] <BlackermanZX> god the camera work
[7:52:07] <+thelovingfool> the stinger parry is tight
[7:52:09] <+Parrish_broadnax> hehe hes fightin his way
[7:52:14] <anuchallengertwitch> Another thing, I  thought Raven Beak was going to turn out to be a women, you know as a call back to the "Samus is a girl" reveal
[7:52:16] <+VictorVonLouche> Normal beam shots do more damage in those clashes get way more hits in.
[7:52:16] <+thelovingfool> hes probably too tired to wanna try
[7:52:16] <@Menitta> there;s a lot going on in this fight
[7:52:18] <redwidow1358> I think it's weird and cool that this guy has the gatling beam thing from Samus Returns
[7:52:22] <%Prevot> chozo would've totally dominated the galaxy if they were all power hungry nutjobs like Raven Beak
[7:52:22] <%HyVoltxge> Fun fact: His robes say "Power is everything" in the Chozo language
[7:52:25] <+ajwinky> it's easier to wait for the taunt tbh
[7:52:40] <%HollowedIdjit> @Prevot absolutely, it would have been such a stomp
[7:52:40] <+ScatFace> @anuchallengertwitch was the birb even given a gender?
[7:52:40] <anuchallengertwitch> @HyVoltxge He totally iS Bird Vergil
[7:52:41] <KABOSxArt> this fight is sooo cool
[7:52:43] <miucsa51> KomodoHype
[7:52:43] <breadmeng> yeah i wish He was a She as well, cheeky callback
[7:52:50] <mister_z_1994> I actually didn't know you could parry him when he taunts you at first so I just stood there like a dumbass laming it out
[7:52:51] <%LastHazzerd> what a setup
[7:52:52] <+TaurusOxford> @ajwinky that also takes way longer to do.
[7:52:52] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Bird Vergil?
[7:52:55] <%fetrigon> gigabotch
[7:53:01] <anuchallengertwitch> @anuchallengertwitch Quiet Robe refered to Raven Beak as a he
[7:53:04] <%HyVoltxge> He's legit Bird Vergil, yes
[7:53:07] <leomuratore> The true Brigil
[7:53:09] <Asuterisuku> The Vergil to Samus' Nero
[7:53:13] <reticulatas> why is there no damage feedback most of the time
[7:53:15] <+Solid_Stro> Bergil
[7:53:20] <+Keanotix> the most violent Father-Daughter Quarrel
[7:53:21] <leomuratore> Birgil
[7:53:22] <Ronin_Remix> Family Bonding
[7:53:24] <KABOSxArt> bird bison
[7:53:24] <breadmeng> Birbgil
[7:53:26] <+thelovingfool> i love him firing his laser pointing away
[7:53:28] <%LastHazzerd> @sonofthedeepsouth mor like Sparta aparently
[7:53:29] <anuchallengertwitch> @breadmeng Yeah that would've been cool. It could've also given the CHozo kind of like a warrior women thing
[7:53:29] <ManfredA> @reticulatas he has a shield
[7:53:29] <BlackermanZX> @reticulatas because yellow form is invincible until parried
[7:53:31] <pepinillomaton> Difficult mating season for bird person
[7:53:35] <%HollowedIdjit> @reticulatas Gold Energy Shield makes him invulnerable
[7:53:41] <%RealThiele> BFG
[7:53:44] <+Keanotix> his arm cannon is bigger than you
[7:53:47] <@Menitta> That's straight up a Marvel beam super lmao
[7:53:47] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Bury The  Bird deep within! No wait
[7:53:50] <peachy996> I dunno I feel like if Raven Beak was Samus mother it'd steal a little bit from Mother Brain
[7:54:03] <ManfredA> this is the real boss fight
[7:54:05] <+thelovingfool> you HAVE to take only pot shots in this phase
[7:54:15] <breadmeng> "scuuuse me while I Hyper Viper"
[7:54:28] <%RyTYoung> god damnit twitch has been shitty with the notifications recently
[7:54:33] <%HyVoltxge> Hey, if Nero makes it to Smash 6. he can bond with Samus over having an evil dickhead dad
[7:54:33] <peachy996> Even though it's not actually a  maternal connection
[7:54:47] <anuchallengertwitch> @peachy996 I can kind of see where you're coming from, But I still think it could've been cool
[7:54:48] <+sonofthedeepsouth> nani
[7:54:49] <$NitronStreams> Damn
[7:54:50] <%fetrigon> woolie
[7:54:52] <ohno778> Birdgil
[7:54:54] <BlackermanZX> that lil super bomb LUL
[7:54:56] <themightycation> You're doing well!
[7:54:56] <essence_of_lariatto> does power bomb do damage?
[7:54:57] <+TaurusOxford> slide the psycho crusher
[7:54:57] <ManfredA> the morph ball timing for it is tight
[7:54:57] <double_zr_tap> you can do it WoolZ!!
[7:54:58] <%RealThiele> ok so not 200 but crusher deals 122 damage
[7:54:59] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Gambatte Woolie
[7:55:00] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Nice try Woolie, keep it up!
[7:55:03] <ManfredA> @essence_of_lariatto yes
[7:55:04] <+Solid_Stro> doodDed
[7:55:06] <+ajwinky> not bad, he's getting it
[7:55:08] <ELFucilaNeroIV> gotta low profile that psycho crusher
[7:55:09] <+thelovingfool> i always have a hard time with the big beam
[7:55:09] <shotgang86> man 8 hours streaming is taking its tool
[7:55:09] <%HollowedIdjit> Chozo Curasha
[7:55:09] <zentzen> just slide
[7:55:10] <+MisterAvry> We believe in you
[7:55:10] <+ScatFace> every attack is avoidable in this game
[7:55:14] <Maverick2736> Stupid sexy feathery Bison
[7:55:15] <breadmeng> damn it, now i keep hearing deadpool going bangbangbanh when he does the rapid shots
[7:55:16] <Ronin_Remix> damn dad doesn't take it easy
[7:55:16] <%mitchteck> Try ducking for the psycho crusher
[7:55:21] <fairore> @HyVoltxge virgil not evil just a dick
[7:55:21] <%fetrigon> @shotgang86 oh yeah
[7:55:22] <%RyTYoung> This fight is so fucking good
[7:55:27] <breadmeng> bang*
[7:55:30] <+ScatFace> you can slide over the psycho crusher
[7:55:41] <BudderZilla> bam!
[7:55:44] <%HyVoltxge> @fairore True, but he was kind of a villain at first
[7:55:48] <+ScatFace> so it can be done on reaction
[7:56:29] <BudderZilla> Yo, he taunts RyuChamp
[7:56:31] <%RyTYoung> I mess that parry up alot
[7:56:35] <+ScatFace> @RyTYoung hands down, my favorite fight in the franchise
[7:56:36] <$razielhex> just taking black holes to the face
[7:56:37] <jumpyhugs> stay on the ground
[7:56:40] <Asuterisuku> He doesn't take damage while glowing gold.
[7:56:45] <ManfredA> the timing on the stinger parry is actually extremely free
[7:56:47] <breadmeng> I love how he uses the beam as a sword when he's better off taking the shot
[7:56:50] <anuchallengertwitch> Wonder if Raven Beak was responsible for the Chozo invading Zebes, and that's why Ridley got his start of violence
[7:56:59] <+ajwinky> he does't take damage but you should still shoot him out of principle
[7:57:03] <+witchdoctorpinkish_> parry dat
[7:57:07] <+Artemis_Scowl> i doubt woolie is gonna notice that's parryable lol
[7:57:10] <%Prevot> mercury steam has now made the two best final boss fights in this franchise
[7:57:14] <%RyTYoung> @scatface 100% the difficulty is through the roof, you've got to master this fight
[7:57:15] <%RealThiele> i mean after this game its obvious Chozo werent just intergalactic good guys they did some nasty shit
[7:57:18] <%HollowedIdjit> @anuchallengertwitch Raven Beak is p much responsible for everything that happens the series, indirectly if nothing else
[7:57:19] <BlackermanZX> its a good heal if you manage to parry
[7:57:24] <+Axle13j> @ajwinky damn straight
[7:57:26] <@Menitta> its shocking how far this studio has come
[7:57:29] <Ronin_Remix> BIRD UP
[7:57:29] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1447814216103104512?t=FMN9Zf2S4JsthZvBIlfXDQ&s=19
[7:57:32] <jumpyhugs> @Artemis_Scowl nah, he knows
[7:57:42] <@Menitta> Like two games and they're now top tier in 2D design
[7:57:50] <%Namillus> @RealThiele Yeah that's why they stopped being an empire, they dissolved their own state and went into conclaves across the galaxy as hermit communes
[7:57:52] <%HyVoltxge> I missed having Ridley in Dread until I fought this motherfucker. Totally made up for it
[7:57:54] <%HeroToxiko> i feel like this boss would do a speech about mankind willing it's own end
[7:57:56] <+Parrish_broadnax> scurry, sniff, Flinch!
[7:57:56] <@Menitta> After a bunch of meh to bad
[7:57:57] <+alphonseisbest> @anuchallengertwitch going by metroid lore he probably also spit in his dead mom mouth while looking directly at Ridley too LUL
[7:57:58] <breadmeng> he looks cooler without the shoulder tassles
[7:58:06] <DoctorMulholland> gonna wanna morphball when he dashes
[7:58:06] <$razielhex> @HyVoltxge There must always be a Ridley
[7:58:11] <shotgang86> huh, you can shinespark in this arena
[7:58:11] <anuchallengertwitch> @HollowedIdjit Yeah pretty much. I think he also influenced Mother Brain's ideology, if not through programming then emotional manipulation
[7:58:11] <%Prevot> God I'm fucking glad Ridley is not here
[7:58:22] <$razielhex> Ridley Didley Didley
[7:58:23] <peachy996> I miss Ridley too but Raven Beak though PLUS I was glad to see Ridley's Bro Kraid make a comeback
[7:58:23] <+HakureiIllusion> I think these two games only came out well because of how closely they worked with Nintendo, we've seen how bad they were before when left to their own devices
[7:58:24] <%HollowedIdjit> I could see that yeah
[7:58:24] <%Prevot> bet he's gonna be in prime 4 tho
[7:58:25] <%RyTYoung> Ridley with an arm cannon...?
[7:58:27] <@Menitta> I would've been pissed if Ridley showed up
[7:58:27] <+PA_august> he's busy in Smash
[7:58:28] <%HeroToxiko> @Prevot the mask is still on LUL
[7:58:28] <trigunstar26> They made more than 2 but these last 2 are all that matter
[7:58:37] <+MisterAvry> 2 loops!
[7:58:39] <anuchallengertwitch> I love Ridley , but he deserves a break, let Kraid get some fun in too
[7:58:42] <Tham1k> Zombie ridley for dread 2
[7:58:43] <+ajwinky> yeah, I'm glad that they limited the old bosses to kraid
[7:58:45] <%HyVoltxge> Timeline wise, Ridley shouldn't be here. But that purple mf has come back from the dead so many times it's ridiculous
[7:58:46] <jumpyhugs> I think the tooltip "every boss's attack is avoidable" is one of the best tooltips I've seen in a game
[7:58:47] <%RealThiele> this was also made during COVID so good on em
[7:58:47] <+alphonseisbest> #NO MORE RIDLEY
[7:58:56] <+ScatFace> ridley's appearances in the games got redundant
[7:58:57] <%RyTYoung> #No more Kraid?
[7:58:58] <dadeaner> downloaded
[7:58:59] <+Ropcord> i'm a big fan of how much of your gear this and the metroid queen force from SR you to use
[7:59:00] <BlackermanZX> you got the phase 2 pattern down
[7:59:03] <%HeroToxiko> if this is a sequel, ridley is super dead
[7:59:07] <+ajwinky> Kraid is as dead as you get after this game tho
[7:59:07] <%Namillus> @HyVoltxge The Ridley you fight in Fusion is Ridley-X so he gets nommed.
[7:59:09] <+Ropcord> thank you brain very cool sentence
[7:59:14] <peachy996> I hope to see Ridley and Kraid's clone mecha phazon infested X copies hang out together in Prime 4
[7:59:15] <UnsteadyFunk> Friendship ended with Ridley. Raven Beak is my new best friend
[7:59:17] <Halospaz117> @jumpyhugs "It's not unfair, you just suck"

[8:00:46] <+thelovingfool> the sun CAN be deal with
[8:00:46] <+MagiKestral> color coded
[8:00:49] <Gelphaze> Power Bomb can break that SUN!
[8:00:49] <Asuterisuku> He just Shinesparked at you
[8:00:50] <+TaurusOxford> "super bomb" LUL
[8:00:51] <+ShutUpAceyP> this ain't no SA-X final fight
[8:00:51] <BlackermanZX> yeyeye
[8:00:51] <greengregguy> We Furi now
[8:00:51] <%Savatewolf> AND HE SHINESPARKS YOU
[8:00:54] <+MagiKestral> @spawnzie no he's using the aeion dash
[8:00:54] <+LandOfTheWay> sun can be power bombed, i think
[8:00:54] <OpenYourEels4TheNextFeels> Power bomb to get rid of the sun
[8:00:56] <trigunstar26> Wow I didn‚Äôt know that orb did that
[8:00:56] <%jinking79> Powerful to bomb a small Star
[8:00:56] <Ronin_Remix> he's summons a Sun?!
[8:00:57] <+sonofthedeepsouth> SPEEDRUNNERS HATE IT
[8:01:00] <+alphonseisbest> HOLY SHIT THIS FIGHT
[8:01:00] <Alzero83> Birdgil Can Shinespark too
[8:01:02] <breadmeng> Angry Sun from Mario 2 returns
[8:01:02] <+thelovingfool> the shinespark is so cool
[8:01:04] <$razielhex> You make even the devil cry!
[8:01:04] <+kogathemaster> Dad bird is hardcore
[8:01:06] <trigunstar26> I just power bombed on sight
[8:01:06] <wqorst> oh he's here, this boss is so sick
[8:01:07] <+DatAsuna> rule of 3s on this guy
[8:01:13] <Shwepie> @Savatewolf He insta-shinesparks, what a dick!
[8:01:19] <IzunaDrop27> that's Frieza's technique
[8:01:20] <$razielhex> Bird Up vs. Hyperdeath's Gabriel
[8:01:20] <Blank9> just 8 more phases
[8:01:25] <+MisterAvry> "Power bomb the sun" seems more like a DMC solution, but let's roll with it
[8:01:26] <double_zr_tap> I like how he uses the anon abilities from returns too
[8:01:27] <peachy996> Honestly though I'd be satisfied if Ridley's last canon fight with Samus is Fusion.
[8:01:43] <+thelovingfool> this is easily one of my fav bosses of all time
[8:01:49] <%HollowedIdjit> I remember going into this fighting wondering what I'd need over 200 missiles for. I think I dumped around that many into him.
[8:01:53] <JacknZack27> I didn‚Äôt realize you can destroy the sun. I thought you just had to dodge
[8:01:55] <anuchallengertwitch> @HyVoltxge  Ridley will come back in the Metroid Game that finally  goes fully into the afterlife/undead nature of the Metroid universe. He'll be the main rival character along with Phantoon (who will get some more lore)
[8:01:58] <+MagiKestral> all three of Raven's abilities are aeion based: lightning armor, beam burst, and flash shift!
[8:01:59] <$razielhex> FIGHT HORUS, MORTAL
[8:01:59] <+insanestephen> Ridley could not be more dead he's died about 3 times and then in Fusion, Samus eats his X version
[8:02:14] <%RyTYoung> Can Samus just have devil bringer in the next game doing dope arm shit?
[8:02:17] <+NeonNobleKalzeria> ridley was dead since other m
[8:02:18] <Jnkolm> Yea Max dodged 2 of the Suns when he beat 'im
[8:02:21] <peachy996> Oh man I could go for some more Phantoon
[8:02:24] <anuchallengertwitch> @insanestephen Unless that ow means that Ridley lives on in Samus now
[8:02:25] <Halospaz117> @insanestephen Can't get more dead than vore'd
[8:02:26] <%xeros720> him using the beam as a giant sword is so damn cool
[8:02:26] <breadmeng> You get past phase 3, then the zero suit phase Kappa
[8:02:28] <%HollowedIdjit> give Samus Metroid Bringer in Prime 4
[8:02:34] <+HakureiIllusion> Woolie still at full damn energy
[8:02:44] <%RyTYoung> @hollowedidjit that'd be sick

[8:17:12] <jumpyhugs> Thank you, Mercury Steam
[8:17:12] <+sonofthedeepsouth> WHAT PRIME
[8:17:12] <miucsa51> Sakamoto redemption has been completed
[8:17:15] <ELFucilaNeroIV> SAKAMOTO REDEEMED
[8:17:15] <+thelovingfool> super was GROUNDBRAKING, but this is the better game
[8:17:15] <emMmDeeKay> Rip METROID PRIME 4
[8:17:15] <Deasmeister> I thought that was other M Woolie?
[8:17:16] <Darren716> Now just wait another 18 years for the next one Kappa
[8:17:16] <tangowulf> But is it worth $60? /s
[8:17:20] <+ajwinky> That final boss though
[8:17:20] <otterlyhyped> More like Dread having to follow this one up
[8:17:21] <%TheBensonator_> Not only did they kill it
[8:17:22] <+polothegreatest> redemption arc LUL
[8:17:24] <%Prevot> I don't even need Prime 4 anymore
[8:17:24] <Halospaz117> Reminder that Raven Beak was just hyping himself up to you the entire game
[8:17:24] <%brisk_dacat> The bar officially risen
[8:17:25] <%AlteisenReiseZ> MERCURY STEAM REDEEMED
[8:17:26] <Paranoid_Jumbotron> if only dread had a good ost
[8:17:27] <wibbwobbler> Niiice
[8:17:28] <ct_2> The DMC5 of Metroid
[8:17:29] <$NitronStreams> WELL DOWN MERCURY STEAM
[8:17:29] <+spawnzie> Brought to you by the creators of Mirror of fate!
[8:17:31] <%TheBensonator_> But they packed it with psaBig woolieLORE
[8:17:33] <IceyCone> This game has the hypest shit
[8:17:33] <Asuterisuku> EASILY a contender for my favourite game of all time.
[8:17:34] <emMmDeeKay> @elfucilaneroiv FUCK THAT noise
[8:17:34] <%wardogleader15> what a Quality Final Boss though
[8:17:35] <$NitronStreams> done*
[8:17:37] <+eanscrale> RIP retro, they have a hard act to follow
[8:17:37] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> The musi-oh...
[8:17:37] <drhivesphd> mind if i clip this review?
[8:17:38] <Darren716> AlteisenReiseZ They were redeemed last game!
[8:17:41] <SunsetJack> Adam never said lady after Samus woke up makes sense uh?
[8:17:42] <ELFucilaNeroIV> METROID IS BACK
[8:17:44] <%xeros720> @AlteisenReiseZ never figured i'd ever say that after mirror of fate
[8:17:45] <jagchan> im very happy for all you metroid fans
[8:17:45] <fairore> i fail that run LUL LUL
[8:17:48] <SolquidSnake> The fuckin Metroid Suit tho
[8:17:48] <+minibarfs_> "this game isn't worth $60" - some weirdo
[8:17:52] <SolquidSnake> God damn
[8:17:52] <+MagiKestral> @paranoid_jumbotron there's plenty of bangers,I just think the mix is low
[8:17:56] <sirjames079> I don't know if its the best Metroid game, but holy shit is Raven Beak a GREAT villain and final boss
[8:17:56] <ManfredA> @Halospaz117 is it more or less pathetic if they're actually that hype
[8:17:56] <%RealThiele> Yea it was never Adam after the elevator
[8:17:57] <$razielhex> 30 fukken years
[8:17:58] <breadmeng> My only gripe is the music never grabbed me
[8:17:59] <+TheyCallMeVawn> Not worth $60 btw
[8:18:04] <%Namillus> @minibarfs_ That weirdo's right, this game is worth $80
[8:18:05] <DeltaD36> JUST ENOUGH
[8:18:06] <%jinking79> Prime 4 got a lot to live up to now
[8:18:07] <+LandOfTheWay> exposition that doesn't suck
[8:18:09] <peachy996> Raven Beak got weakened by the X so we never truly got that Full Powered Samus vs Raven Beak fight
[8:18:09] <+TaurusOxford> @TheyCallMeVawn yep, total rip off Kappa
[8:18:09] <+ScatFace> @Paranoid_Jumbotron the weakest part of the game is the ost, the best tracks are renditions of songs from previous games
[8:18:11] <%OtakuSnake1> The music could have been better, but everything else was perfection
[8:18:11] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @ohno778
[8:18:13] <shotgang86> and now NOWHERE TO GO with the story
[8:18:14] <watts121> @TheyCallMeVawn totally was tho
[8:18:15] <%BisoromiBear> met the folks
[8:18:16] <+LazyAss24Seven> connection to ADAM was lost as soon as she went down
[8:18:17] <Halospaz117> @Halospaz117 yes
[8:18:18] <omnishadeee> @WoolieVersus notice adam never called you lady on the planet, only samus?
[8:18:29] <Deasmeister> I love how it was actually Raven Beak jacking himself off as adam all game
[8:18:30] <thisisacoolguy> @WoolieVersus Adam bot's giveaway was the fact it kept calling her Samus instead of Lady
[8:18:30] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[8:18:32] <+DotRook> when people ask if Samus is Metroid
[8:18:33] <Paranoid_Jumbotron> metroid suit will not let you glory kill in the next metroid mark my words
[8:18:33] <TheJustGordo> A lot of spanish names LUL
[8:18:34] <+witchdoctorpinkish_> see you in 20 years for metroid 6
[8:18:34] <%xeros720> well she was raised by Old Beak i think?
[8:18:38] <SunsetJack> Dread Woolie, Dread.
[8:18:42] <ExpressNode> Now for Other M¬≤
[8:18:43] <+HakureiIllusion> Old Bird
[8:18:44] <Alzero83> the Thotha Gene to control the Metroid
[8:18:44] <+LazyAss24Seven> it was "BirDAM"  all along! nliAhhh
[8:18:45] <DeltaD36> Old Bird and Grey Voice are in the photo of her being modified
[8:18:45] <%RealThiele> Merc Steam is a spain located company
[8:18:45] <BlackermanZX> i bet the metroid suit will be back
[8:18:46] <miucsa51> Sakamoto and Mercurysteam Redeemed
[8:18:48] <+NeonNobleKalzeria> shorter games worth more is personally where I hope games get to, as long as working people get paid more to be able to buy them
[8:18:48] <%xeros720> but she was probably given Raven Beak's dna to be a chozo warrior and use the suit
[8:18:49] <peachy996> Raven Beak was one of the dads
[8:18:49] <Halospaz117> He was a doner but he didn't raise her
[8:18:50] <+shootbang_exe> I think he was just a dna donor not the one who raised her
[8:18:51] <ohno778> See you next mission....in 8 years
[8:18:52] <+ajwinky> She was raised by good bird dads, but this bird dad was the DNA donor forher
[8:18:54] <Aeroallways> She was like 3 when that stuff happened. I don't remember shit from my teens.
[8:18:54] <+DatAsuna> She never met him in person
[8:18:58] <+spawnzie> she wasn't concious in the tube I guess
[8:19:03] <jorniev> APARENTLY you can tell it wasnt adam cause he nevers calls you lady
[8:19:03] <Tham1k> How many dads did samus have
[8:19:03] <$razielhex> @miucsa51 Now they can be funded for Lords of Shadow 3
[8:19:04] <emMmDeeKay> @xeros720 Samus had 2 Gay Dads and you CAN'T take that from me
[8:19:06] <%LastHazzerd> Lesbian space hero raised by 2 bird dads
[8:19:08] <kinkade_77> next metroid is gonna be soon, it has to be
[8:19:08] <%Lord_Rockman> mercury steam is based in Spain
[8:19:09] <shotgang86> and all that talk of "Adam" being "that Raven beak though, big dick"
[8:19:10] <breadmeng> Old Bird and Grey Voice were her manga dads
[8:19:10] <+DatAsuna> her actual bird dad is chill
[8:19:11] <%RealThiele> she had a different Thoha bird dad
[8:19:12] <+NeonNobleKalzeria> Sakamoto said there's already plans for future games
[8:19:17] <Gelphaze> What is this Resident Evil Shit!

[8:19:18] <BlackermanZX> Yeah raven was just her dad in dna only
[8:19:20] <drhivesphd> @NeonNobleKalzeria OH YESSSSSSSSS
[8:19:22] <%DeadManProp> Good times, good times
[8:19:22] <mothdude> Biggest tell was "Adam" telling you not to go into superheated zones
[8:19:22] <%Prevot> even his immediate family bought it
[8:19:30] <+agumon9000> @WoolieVersus The entire game that wasn't ADAM it was Raven Beak luring Samus to unlock her metroid power
[8:19:32] <peachy996> I love how Raven Beak gets to Master Miller in MGS1 Samus
[8:19:32] <Darthkitten_Prime> The computer was being impersonated ever since waking up at the start
[8:19:33] <BlackermanZX> also adam never calls you lady afte the intro
[8:19:33] <TemperedSkull> At least it's not the feddys this time
[8:19:35] <+R_BChe> was that really adam the entire game? or was just the final adam a fake
[8:19:35] <+LandOfTheWay> raven beak donated chozo dna, he didn't raise her. that was old bird and gray voice
[8:19:35] <doggieo> Cant betray what was never on your side to begin with
[8:19:39] <Asuterisuku> It's implied that Quiet Robe was also a donor.
[8:19:39] <Paranoid_Jumbotron> samus metroid speaks turkish confirmed
[8:19:40] <%LastHazzerd> He never calls you Lady
[8:19:40] <peachy996> It's so good
[8:19:41] <drhivesphd> https://clips.twitch.tv/SuccessfulAlluringCobraCorgiDerp-SYfsl1ObcsLLJymp
[8:19:46] <%wardogleader15> It wasn't Adam who betrayed you!
[8:19:47] <Halospaz117> Her only lines are bird speak and AGGGHHHHHHHH. Perfection
[8:19:47] <%FenixSeraph> raised, MOLDED by the dark
[8:19:47] <+ajwinky> The best Samus voice acting was that scream
[8:19:48] <DeltaD36> So it's was modified so she could live there
[8:19:53] <+minibarfs_> absolute GOTY contender
[8:19:53] <tmvct1> "ADAM" Never said Lady again after the start of the game
[8:19:53] <Tham1k> Only ship adam was real adam
[8:19:54] <OpenYourEels4TheNextFeels> If you notice, Adam stops calling you lady after your first encounter with Raven Beak
[8:19:55] <+DatAsuna> @BlackermanZX TBH he's no more her dad than somebody who donates a kidney to you
[8:19:56] <jorniev> man samus is gonna get arrested by the space cops next game isnt she?
[8:19:57] <+sonofthedeepsouth> it's a mess
[8:19:59] <+Superbro64> is THAT why she's a 9 foot tall super woman?
[8:19:59] <%RealThiele> Chozo not actually the good guys
[8:20:00] <%BisoromiBear> Bird Aizen
[8:20:01] <Halospaz117> She's a fucking petri dish
[8:20:01] <+D00msDayDan> two DIFFERENT chozo
[8:20:02] <+sonofthedeepsouth> ITS A FUCKIN MESS
[8:20:02] <@Menitta> She;s a mess lol
[8:20:03] <SideChar> its bleach

[8:24:07] <peachy996> Knocked out of the park
[8:24:07] <emMmDeeKay> @slatersev Prime 4 has been erased from significance
[8:24:08] <jorniev> so far
[8:24:09] <%BisoromiBear> video game good
[8:24:10] <miucsa51> Game of the year every year

[8:24:20] <%Prevot> everybody rumored
[8:24:21] <ELFucilaNeroIV> This DS game
[8:24:21] <AngryAsian5> WE ATE GOOD
[8:24:23] <Paranoid_Jumbotron> now compare this game to the retro dread concept art
[8:24:24] <%Double_Tap_That> from dead to DREAD
[8:24:26] <+ALazo> I bounce off of metroidvanias super hard every time but every time I see this one I start to think I should get it
[8:24:26] <AngryAsian5> EVERYONE'S FULL LUL
[8:24:26] <breadmeng> THE MEME WAS MADE REAL
[8:24:27] <$razielhex> DREAD 'MON.  REAL DREAD.

[8:24:37] <%RealThiele> dino DNA
[8:24:41] <Halospaz117> Here's hoping Prime 4 measures up
[8:24:41] <+the22cstomp> mercurysteam is the goa
[8:24:42] <IceyCone> Prediction for next Metroid Title name?
[8:24:44] <@Menitta> Hopes are high with Prime 4
[8:24:46] <shotgang86> (and then no more metroids are made)
[8:24:46] <+D00msDayDan> yeah go ahead and let mercury stream be the metroid studio
[8:24:46] <BudderZilla> Like Strider 2014?
[8:24:47] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Metroid 6 let's go
[8:24:52] <Shwepie> "Project Dread is nearing completion." -Metroid Prime: Corruption
[8:24:53] <peachy996> YOU ARE FULLY IN
[8:24:53] <+minibarfs_> sometimes you just need 19 years to get a 10/10 game
[8:24:54] <reonome> @IceyCone prime 4 Kappa
[8:24:55] <+DatAsuna> amiibo ain't enough
[8:24:55] <+MisterAvry> merchandising!
[8:24:55] <Darren716> White suit statue? In the trash
[8:24:56] <drhivesphd> RAVENBEAK STATUE INCOMING?
[8:24:58] <faeron93> so we fight the Fed next right?
[8:25:00] <DoctorMulholland> My reaction to this title dropping at E3 was basically what Woolie's was when DMC5 first got shown off. I yelled so hard when I saw it.
[8:25:00] <Aeroallways> We need bird dad figurines
[8:25:01] <tmvct1> Metroid Dread Space
[8:25:02] <%xeros720> that Metroid look
[8:25:04] <$razielhex> @IceyCone "The Metroid"
[8:25:06] <Paranoid_Jumbotron> who wouldve guessed that metroid 2 was the most important game in the lore?
[8:25:06] <miucsa51> Birdgil
[8:25:07] <ELFucilaNeroIV> I want a Ravenbeak statue
[8:25:09] <breadmeng> 3D print of Raven Beak when
[8:25:10] <mister_z_1994> Yall better be working on that Dread Varia figma Good Smile
[8:25:11] <+fugatlas> ah damn did credits already roll
[8:25:12] <Halospaz117> Speaking of, i gotta go and finish the prime games now, I only beat the 2D games in prep for this one
[8:25:13] <%RealThiele> gravity suit figma would be FIRE
[8:25:14] <DeltaD36> THE BABY
[8:25:14] <+ScatFace> I really want to own raven beak with wings as a statue
[8:25:14] <Alzero83> Look up the Speed Puzzle the you and Max both had a realization in @WoolieVersus
[8:25:15] <emMmDeeKay> Whens Metroid Suit Samus
[8:25:15] <TemperedSkull> finna cop the amiibo
[8:25:18] <%Namillus> Metroid Ascension
[8:25:21] <BudderZilla> all of  it!
[8:25:25] <+MisterAvry> Metroid The Falmethrower!
[8:25:25] <Tempmael> raven beak in smash when?
[8:25:27] <DoctorMulholland> Even if we did ever get Metroid 5 I knew it would never be Dread. And then it WAS
[8:25:30] <%Prevot> I have little faith in Prime 4
[8:25:30] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1447814216103104512?t=FMN9Zf2S4JsthZvBIlfXDQ&s=19
[8:25:31] <peachy996> Which Raven Beak? He has 3 different looks
[8:25:32] <@Menitta> Prime 4 is still gonna be a much slower paced game
[8:25:33] <lonosis47> PRIME 4 zekeLUL
[8:25:34] <+AnthraxJohnson> I missed the ending?! Did he enjoy it
[8:25:34] <DeltaD36> Fingers crossed woolie.
[8:25:34] <slatersev> God I hope so
[8:25:36] <peachy996> And they're all cool
[8:25:36] <+polothegreatest> Next gaem would be more lore OR samus clone
[8:25:38] <lonosis47> PRIME 4 TRASHHZ
[8:25:39] <Paranoid_Jumbotron> prime 4 like NEEDS to take stuff from dread
[8:25:40] <%Namillus> Mercury Steam have fuckin' shinespark-spiked the ball into Retro's half of the court
[8:25:40] <+HakureiIllusion> Five more years for Prime 4
[8:25:42] <IceyCone> Prime 4 will probably not be tied yeah
[8:25:42] <+ScatFace> Prime is a different beast, but you have to remember it's set before metroid 2
[8:25:43] <%Savatewolf> This is a huge bar for Prime 4
[8:25:45] <omnishadeee> they can make prime 4 post metroid 5 now
[8:25:45] <+CherteuseKapibara> prime 4 in 2040
[8:25:45] <%Prevot> Kensuke Tanabe is in charge of Metroid and he sucks
[8:25:47] <+DatAsuna> Why y'all shitting on prime 4?
[8:25:47] <+j_feezyy> Metroid Infinite
[8:25:48] <%fetrigon> @anthraxjohnson yes
[8:25:48] <mister_z_1994> I mean we got a cyborg Ridley in Samus Returns
[8:25:49] <emMmDeeKay> I feel sorry for Prime $
[8:25:50] <%RealThiele> i for one want prime 4 to be better than dread
[8:25:58] <shotgang86> Prime 4 needs to give something for Metroid 6
[8:26:00] <+ajwinky> It would be sweet if they had some lore hints of Raven Beak in Prime 4
[8:26:00] <+NickHatesSnow> yea same
[8:26:04] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> I feel the other way around, but it's all good
[8:26:04] <emMmDeeKay> Prime 4 has a HUGE hurdle to overcome
[8:26:05] <fairore> all i need is the suck to come back
[8:26:05] <peachy996> Same, for me Metroid is 2d
[8:26:05] <miucsa51> BTW Other M STILL CANON
[8:26:09] <SlimeSlimeSlime> The feeling of The Baby.
[8:26:10] <omnishadeee> ur never gonna get speedbooster like that in 3d
[8:26:12] <fairore> succ
[8:26:12] <ELFucilaNeroIV> 2D hits different
[8:26:14] <+FrostySoftServe> Maybe thats why prime 4 got restarted,maybe they wanted to link the stories better
[8:26:15] <%jinking79> the Prime X Parasite
[8:26:16] <+ScatFace> @WoolieVersus What are your thoughts on people entering the series with dread as their first game in the franchise?
[8:26:18] <+QuestJefferson> I feel like they're different flavors and they don't have to be extremely similar
[8:26:19] <%xeros720> love that metroid bread
[8:26:28] <ohno778> Prime isn't canon?
[8:26:28] <mister_z_1994> I'm so glad they brought the Speed Booster back. I missed it in SR
[8:26:30] <breadmeng> Need to see where Prime 4 sits in the timeline
[8:26:31] <Alzero83> I tweeted you the same speed puzzle shenanigans you and Max went thru @WoolieVersus
[8:26:32] <+Superbro64> the animations are SUPER clean
[8:26:33] <slatersev> Prime is canon
[8:26:33] <zenith0111> When I got Metroid Prime for Gamecube... I traded it away
[8:26:33] <%HyVoltxge> Hopefully Nintendo takes the reception of Dread into account while continuing to make Prime 4
[8:26:36] <+Superbro64> it looks fantastic
[8:26:40] <slatersev> Sakamoto has said as much
[8:26:41] <+ScatFace> I know a good amount of people who entered the franchise with dread and I have mixed feelings about it
[8:26:42] <peachy996> Other M is still Canon but Fusion and Dread to a great job of wiping it away as "It gets better"
[8:26:42] <tangowulf> It's a shame the Mercury Steam Castlevania games weren't this good
[8:26:44] <jorniev> SAMUS just being all around BADASS
[8:26:47] <Jnkolm> Prime and Other M aren't cannon with the 2d games
[8:26:51] <+Raspada_Ryner> The implications of what Samus is now is so cool for future games
[8:26:51] <+DatAsuna> Prime doesn't really play like an FPS
[8:26:53] <+ajwinky> the Prime series is like a prequel isn't it?
[8:26:56] <%RealThiele> yeah this game has sold enough that Sakamoto will have his sequel
[8:26:57] <shotgang86> Prime happens after Super Metroid, right?
[8:26:57] <jorniev> also i didnt think she would speak
[8:27:00] <BudderZilla> Shine-sparking all over!
[8:27:01] <emMmDeeKay> When you ded but Metroid Suit Samus is still Succing
[8:27:04] <+minibarfs_> Prime is fantastic for what it is, but nothing beats good ol 2D
[8:27:05] <omnishadeee> prime is atmosphere. on a gameplay level they dont touch the 2d
[8:27:07] <+witchdoctorpinkish_> prime cant take place after 2
[8:27:12] <+DatAsuna> @ajwinky midquel, kinda, it's after zero mission but before 2/super
[8:27:12] <+alphonseisbest> @Jnkolm other M is, deal with it
[8:27:12] <%Prevot> Prime is all between Metroid 1 and 2
[8:27:12] <%Namillus> Prime happens immediately after Zero Mission
[8:27:14] <+Superbro64> Reminder that Nintendo completely scrapped the original Prime 4 project by Bamco, so they really do care about the end product @woolieversus
[8:27:16] <%BananaSlammuh> Prime trilogy is before 2. After 1
[8:27:18] <Darren716> Soooo 7/10?
[8:27:19] <+Superbro64> this game shows that
[8:27:21] <breadmeng> Prime series is between Metroid 1 and 2
[8:27:23] <+spawnzie> prime is right after 1
[8:27:25] <+polothegreatest> thats nintendo supervising everything
[8:27:32] <Maverick2736> I like this timeline were we decanonized Other M's terribad story while keeping the cool action mechanics it brought to the table for future titles
[8:27:36] <+FrostySoftServe> did you ever play/try AM2R?
[8:27:37] <%FenixSeraph> I wish the Switch was more powerful
[8:27:37] <%xeros720> HMM I WONDER HOW WE CAN UPREZ THE GAME
[8:27:38] <IceyCone> Prime is between 1 and 2, Samus Returns confirms it
[8:27:38] <ohno778> it can be....
[8:27:39] <tangowulf> I would love if Dread had online multiplayer deathmatches
[8:27:39] <ELFucilaNeroIV> character action game tier boss fights
[8:27:40] <reonome> just wait for the next game
[8:27:42] <+ScatFace> psst, yuzu runs the game near perfectly
[8:27:47] <omnishadeee> it held a pretty solid 60 fps
[8:27:50] <redwidow1358> Well according to Kotaku, you should be running it at 4K 120 on a pirated copy
[8:27:51] <shotgang86> have you heard of a beautiful magic called EMULATORS darlington?:
[8:27:51] <BudderZilla> They didn't bring Ridley back >:O
[8:27:53] <+polothegreatest> would mario movie sell? LUL
[8:27:54] <%RealThiele> Zero mission prime 1 Hunter prime 2 prime 3  super other M fusion dread
[8:27:55] <%Irridium> Yeah if only huh :)
[8:27:56] <%Prevot> is kotaku hefe in chat
[8:27:57] <miucsa51> Nintendo breathing down your neck is a buff
[8:27:58] <%jinking79> wish i could use DPad
[8:28:00] <+DatAsuna> Switch and frame rate are a demanding mixture
[8:28:01] <emMmDeeKay> Yuzu at 4K LUL
[8:28:01] <%LastHazzerd> no First Person nintendo IP is gonna hit that benchmark
[8:28:04] <Jnkolm> @Jnkolm because you said so? You run Nintendo kid?
[8:28:08] <drhivesphd> https://clips.twitch.tv/SuccessfulAlluringCobraCorgiDerp-SYfsl1ObcsLLJymp
[8:28:10] <Darren716> This was like a religious experience for WOolie
[8:28:12] <+CookieCutter007> don't let twitter find out you use emulators
[8:28:13] <SlimeSlimeSlime> He comin' at us!
[8:28:19] <peachy996> Other M being canon or not is meaningless
[8:28:19] <+Flunkorg> @redwidow1358 First of all, thats not what they said. Secondly, YES YOU SHOULD
[8:28:22] <+QuestJefferson> Give me an adventures of Capt. Falcon game with this energy
[8:28:23] <schoolisforwinners> reminder that time played doesnt count in the menu
[8:28:23] <slatersev> @Jnkolm @Jnkolm Samus Returns directly connects them. And Sakamoto has said its canon in Dread interviews
[8:28:29] <tmvct1> it shoulds transition to Woolie shirt to black screen
[8:28:30] <fairore> yeah
[8:28:31] <@Menitta> Still super excited for Prime 4 though
[8:28:32] <%RealThiele> yea most of other Ms content has been discarded
[8:28:33] <Alzero83> I tweeted you clip of the same speed puzzle shenanigans you and Max went thru @WoolieVersus

[8:28:59] <%V_bob> YES
[8:28:59] <Aracon_> there is absolutely no need
[8:29:00] <%FenixSeraph> JUST WATCH ALIEN
[8:29:01] <gaminglink25> YES!!!
[8:29:01] <+sonofthedeepsouth> DA WAY
[8:29:01] <Treasure_Vault> Unless it's just one fight scene
[8:29:01] <+keiji_maede> yes
[8:29:03] <slidshockingkrow> could be funny tho
[8:29:04] <KIRU> YES
[8:29:04] <peachy996> Absolutely
[8:29:05] <+TheLakinessMonster> There is a Metroid movie, it's called Alien
[8:29:05] <OpenYourEels4TheNextFeels> True!
[8:29:05] <+Superbro64> NO CHRIS PRATT IS THE FUTURE
[8:29:05] <Enajy314> Yes
[8:29:06] <Darren716> No but she needs a buddy tho
[8:29:06] <ohno778> I'D STILL WATCH IT THOUGH
[8:29:07] <+DatAsuna> Metroid doesn't have the story for a movie. lol
[8:29:07] <+polothegreatest> next console needs the switch compatible but higher specs
[8:29:08] <+minibarfs_> The Metroid Movie is Alien
[8:29:09] <miucsa51> just watch alien
[8:29:10] <%RealThiele> CHRIS PRATT IS SAMUS ARAN
[8:29:11] <Deadpool2450> RIDLEY SCOTT HAD HIS CHANCE
[8:29:12] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Just watch Alien
[8:29:12] <%Irridium> VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea
[8:29:14] <redwidow1358> @flunkorg They said "it's a Switch exclusive but all you need is a decently powerful PC and the emulator" with no mention of buying the game whatsoever or hacking your Switch to rip it, until they edited the article and apologized to everyone.
[8:29:14] <ManfredA> a Metroid movie only works if they pull a Dredd and Samus never removes her helmet until the end and it's mostly about solving a problem
[8:29:14] <drhivesphd> FUCK YOU HOLLYWOOD Kappa
[8:29:14] <Treasure_Vault> Chris Pratt is Ridley
[8:29:15] <jorniev> IM DOWN WITH A 5 minutes short
[8:29:16] <vapelad_dabberb01> milla jovovich is metroid
[8:29:16] <Maverick2736> LITERALLY JUST WATCH ALIEN
[8:29:16] <+CookieCutter007> I want Chris Pratt to be Samus
[8:29:17] <emMmDeeKay> Yes FUCK HOLLYWOOD
[8:29:17] <%Prevot> CHRIS PRATT IS SAMUS ARAN
[8:29:17] <mister_z_1994> GameXplain needs to pack it up
[8:29:19] <+Raspada_Ryner> I dread a movie where Samus talks a lot
[8:29:19] <+vaderxyz1970> No she needs to speak more and be acted by ScarJoe
[8:29:19] <shotgang86> But I want to hear live action Samus say "THE BABY"
[8:29:20] <CrazyMedicine> Just watch Alien and Alien 2
[8:29:20] <+ScatFace> the true way to absorb the metroid story is through that one table top game
[8:29:22] <+ajwinky> Make a Metroid movie but it's just a Let's Play of someone playing through Metroid Dread
[8:29:24] <bobdoletrasher> @WoolieVersus and fuck the article saying its cool to emulate this game
[8:29:24] <%DeadManProp> But I want to laugh.
[8:29:25] <%jinking79> Just Watch Aliens that all no Metroid movie
[8:29:26] <+TrevSmith222> Fuck most games being turned into movies.
[8:29:26] <SideChar> yes, but Hollywood heads don't agree with you
[8:29:27] <tmvct1> Or even Other M
[8:29:29] <+spawnzie> Chris Pratt as The Baby
[8:29:29] <%BisoromiBear> I need Samus making 30 quips a minute though
[8:29:29] <@Menitta> they almost made a John Woo Metroid movie
[8:29:29] <Halospaz117> @vapelad_dabberb01 fuuuuuuuuuuuuck yoouuuuuuu
[8:29:30] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @miucsa51
[8:29:30] <+ShutUpAceyP> Luigi for Baby Metroid
[8:29:31] <ohno778> EMMA STONE AS SAMUS
[8:29:32] <SlimeSlimeSlime> David Spade as Ridley!
[8:29:34] <zenith0111> "But my mini-series"
[8:29:35] <Nocturnment> I'd watch an anime
[8:29:37] <DedlokPM> Other M is an example of how a Metroid Movie would probably go
[8:29:38] <wibbwobbler> Yuuup
[8:29:38] <Jflaskd13> I want a 30 min action scene
[8:29:38] <+Flunkorg> @redwidow1358 Wow, weak. They shouldn't have apologized. Piracy is rad.
[8:29:39] <Vyneci> Buh I dun wanna pley I jus wan da stori BibleThump
[8:29:41] <+minibarfs_> Dread is the most video game ass video game
[8:29:42] <%RealThiele> anime is the least offensive
[8:29:43] <+DatAsuna> Does anybody want that?
[8:29:45] <zenith0111> @nocturnment YOURE THE PROBLEM
[8:29:45] <jorniev> i would just watch a mini short
[8:29:45] <%TubeMan642> Scarlet Johansson is Samus Aran
[8:29:48] <+ShutUpAceyP> mandalorian Metroid?
[8:29:50] <+sonofthedeepsouth> OR PLAY OTHER M Kappa
[8:29:50] <Tracazoid> *Samus pops up in Super Marios Brothers Movie Post-credit scene*
[8:29:50] <tangowulf> Metroid would make for an absolutely killer 5 minute music video
[8:29:51] <%paladinstarbuster> no i want an anime tho
[8:29:53] <+DatAsuna> Does that person even exist?
[8:29:54] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Andy Dick as RavenBeak!
[8:29:56] <DevilHands_> An animated version of Zero Mission could be kinda cool tho
[8:29:58] <wqorst> metroid series on the CW
[8:29:58] <%Prevot> yeah Other M cutscenes are what a Metroid movie would be
[8:30:01] <lonosis47> a movie 1-2 hours, you spent 14 hours just to beat this
[8:30:04] <$razielhex> @Tracazoid Miitopia style
[8:30:05] <+ScatFace> Most movie adaptations of video games tend to be a downgrade
[8:30:05] <IceyCone> You can't have a metroid movie because it would have too many characters
[8:30:06] <omnishadeee> no metroid movie could ever top this yes
[8:30:06] <%Dr00_PhD> but dread's too hard i wanna watch games not play them
[8:30:06] <peachy996> I'd be down for an anime or an animated short where she's doing cool shit as a silent protag but yes I agree
[8:30:08] <drhivesphd> YESSIR
[8:30:08] <AngryAsian5> BUT MONEY THO
[8:30:11] <emMmDeeKay> Metroid doesn't need to he ported to an INFERIOR non videogame medium
[8:30:12] <shotgang86> A 40 minute 2D animation
[8:30:17] <drhivesphd> @AngryAsian5 NO Kappa
[8:30:18] <+witchdoctorpinkish_> Other M was the metroid movie
[8:30:19] <redwidow1358> I would love to see what a Metroid movie could be like, but I would also much rather be in control of Samus
[8:30:22] <%Double_Tap_That> Chris Pratt as Samus Aran tho
[8:30:22] <+rahunin> I wouldn't want one because they'd get all the most popular actors just cause money
[8:30:25] <jorniev> nah
[8:30:27] <+Superbro64> Metroid hollywood with Scarlet Johansson WILL HAPPEN, it WILL happen @woolieversus
[8:30:27] <%SirGO0SE> but i cant eat popcorn and play this Kappa
[8:30:28] <+PA_august> Starring John Malkovich as Ridley
[8:30:31] <+fugatlas> *woolie makes himself unsettled with 0 provocation*
[8:30:32] <+DatAsuna> I've not heard anybody say they want a metroid movie since 2006 lmao
[8:30:33] <+sonofthedeepsouth> DA BABY
[8:30:34] <tangowulf> Metroid VR?
[8:30:34] <ohno778> Tarantino
[8:30:35] <+polothegreatest> no talk
[8:30:35] <drhivesphd> just play the game
[8:30:36] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Crispy Ratt as Samus
[8:30:38] <%RealThiele> Tom Hanks is the baby
[8:30:38] <ct_2> there shoild be no video game movies
[8:30:38] <shotgang86> The Baby
[8:30:39] <+ScatFace> voice acted baby metroid
[8:30:39] <+Superbro64> if chris pratt voices Mario it WILL HAPPEN
[8:30:40] <SlimeSlimeSlime> The Baby
[8:30:40] <+Raspada_Ryner> I could see a series that takes place in the world, but not have Samus be the main character
[8:30:41] <$razielhex> y'all just watched through a movie
[8:30:42] <%Irridium> SHE WOULD HAVE A FUCKING METROID PET
[8:30:45] <+LazyAss24Seven> Milla Jovovhich as...
[8:30:46] <jagchan> the baby
[8:30:46] <+polothegreatest> just shooting
[8:30:47] <+MisterAvry> But where will we cast Chris Pratt?
[8:30:47] <iamnotaparrot> Chris Pratt is samus. DaBaby is The Baby
[8:30:47] <zenith0111> Isnt the videogame already an animation guys.....?
[8:30:47] <peachy996> Starring Danny Devito as Gray Beak
[8:30:49] <Tracazoid> The only animal buddy she should ever have is in Smash Bros and it's Pikachu
[8:30:49] <Vertigheist> you dont' even need 2 hours
[8:30:50] <+ScatFace> baby metroid voiced by danny devito
[8:30:51] <Deadpool2450> how handsome should Adam be Kappa
[8:30:53] <+witchdoctorpinkish_> Charlie day as kraid
[8:30:53] <miucsa51> anyone but Ridley scott
[8:30:53] <AngryAsian5> Scarlett Johansson Kappa Kappa
[8:30:54] <+Flunkorg> If they make a movie though, approach it like Dredd. Full helmet, fuck showing her face and put as little dialogue as possible.
[8:30:54] <+D00msDayDan> who's her love interest
[8:30:58] <emMmDeeKay> The Shota Bunny Boy
[8:30:58] <lonosis47> SHORT FILMS zekeLUL
[8:30:59] <+QuestJefferson> I would accept a short manga series about a cool mission Samus does that has nothing to do with Metroids, but at least 40% has to be full spread action pages
[8:30:59] <+Emperor_Machinus> Make the hunters from Prime Hunters come back
[8:31:01] <+Superbro64> @d00msdaydan adam
[8:31:01] <%GeneralSCPatton> Fuck it, give us old veteran Samus played by Sigourney Weaver
[8:31:03] <mister_z_1994> @LazyAss24Seven Oh God don't even get me STARTED on Paul WS Anderson
[8:31:04] <tmvct1> Danny DeVito is THE BABY
[8:31:04] <pi_in_the_sci> a metroid anime would be fine, but the powersuit is the point, and that wouldn't play live
[8:31:07] <$razielhex> @miucsa51 Ridley is literally named after Scott.
[8:31:08] <Jflaskd13> but @WoolieVersus what about my hentia vids! those are ART!
[8:31:08] <%RealThiele> love interest lsrUgh
[8:31:09] <+polothegreatest> Star fox animation was nice
[8:31:09] <Treasure_Vault> Tilda Swinton is Samus Aran
[8:31:10] <+ajwinky> The  Baby Metroid will be replaced with Boss Baby
[8:31:11] <miucsa51> they all suck
[8:31:11] <+j_feezyy> Aya Brea from parasite eve should play samus.
[8:31:12] <ohno778> Pleas no Milla jovavich please
[8:31:13] <+witchdoctorpinkish_> ew scarlet Johansson
[8:31:13] <+sonofthedeepsouth> IS IT?
[8:31:14] <Maverick2736> movies are not the ultimate be-all-end-all form of entertainment
[8:31:14] <+ElDragon_1> Obligatory hot dude love interest
[8:31:16] <%Double_Tap_That> Netflix series would be cool though.
[8:31:18] <drhivesphd> YESSIR
[8:31:19] <Aeroallways> but samus' whole shtick is being alone, the one game that made her truly not alone was other M and we saw how that went
[8:31:20] <bobdoletrasher> @WoolieVersus background federation romantic plot shit to fill the silence
[8:31:25] <powerprotoman> nah woolie Metroid mini series where its the galactic federation progressively getting their shit pushed in and then a final episode where its just samus showing up and Fucking shit up
[8:31:25] <%xeros720> i mean, it'd be a horror movie
[8:31:25] <Shwepie> They tried to make a Metroid game into a move already, that's how we got Other M.
[8:31:30] <+witchdoctorpinkish_> no movie pls
[8:31:31] <%BisoromiBear> Shin Metroid has now been hexed into existence
[8:31:33] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Your boobs have spoken.
[8:31:33] <zenith0111> LET VIDEOGAMES BE VIDEOGAMES
[8:31:35] <+DatAsuna> but what if we got seth rogan as adam?
[8:31:39] <shotgang86> his smile and optimism: RESTORED
[8:31:44] <Alzero83> That Metroid Trigger tho @WoolieVersus
[8:31:52] <CrazyMedicine> @DatAsuna oh god no LUL
[8:31:52] <$razielhex> @DatAsuna Tommy Wiseau
[8:31:56] <%RealThiele> that fake adam drop is really great tho
[8:31:57] <%xeros720> yup
[8:31:57] <%FenixSeraph> yes
[8:32:00] <+ajwinky> It looks cool
[8:32:03] <redwidow1358> Consider this: Studio Trigger making a Metroid anime
[8:32:04] <+alphonseisbest> YUP
[8:32:07] <+alphonseisbest> its great
[8:32:07] <%Animatic_> yup
[8:32:09] <%Prevot> it's basically Sotn
[8:32:12] <+StriderTempxa> @WoolieVersus If it had better music Id give it a 10/10. Prime 4 can't come soon enough.
[8:32:12] <fairore> @ElDragon_1 ugly dude love interest instead ?
[8:32:22] <+ajwinky> Kraid love interest
[8:32:22] <Halospaz117> blame the birds

[8:32:35] <%fetrigon> fuck reflection
[8:32:40] <+MisterAvry> "yeah kinda"
[8:32:42] <drhivesphd> samus is metroid now
[8:32:43] <+DatAsuna> Samus Metroid Aran
[8:32:44] <%fetrigon> yep
[8:32:45] <+Superbro64> dont read my dono woolie, I said the same thing
[8:32:47] <%RealThiele> lore says yeah i guess
[8:32:48] <%SirGO0SE> Jane Metroid
[8:32:49] <%RyTYoung> Holy shit your right, as of this game
[8:32:49] <ELFucilaNeroIV> "y can't metroid crawl?" accurate
[8:32:51] <+TheSaintJohn> what if metroid was a girl? well yeah
[8:32:52] <Alzero83> Link is now the Zelda
[8:32:53] <themightycation> Samus only needs one solid line and a scream, not a movie
[8:32:53] <breadmeng> "in a way"
[8:32:54] <+PA_august> and she cannot crawl
[8:32:57] <+D00msDayDan> halo infinite is going to reveal that john had halo DNA inside him all along
[8:32:58] <+Superbro64> someone took my funny zinger, shit
[8:32:58] <Qsmash_> Some Feddie troops are totally gonna call her Metroid in the next game
[8:32:59] <%Prevot> eh kills aliens and doesn't afraid of anything
[8:32:59] <drhivesphd> CAUSE ITS REAL LUL
[8:32:59] <Asuterisuku> But there's beauty in the lives of beasts!
[8:33:07] <Halospaz117> he thought it was alright
[8:33:08] <@Menitta> SOMEONE learned Samus was a girl with Dread.
[8:33:09] <@Menitta> SOMEONE
[8:33:14] <%wardogleader15> I stuck around for it!
[8:33:16] <lonosis47> @Superbro64 Hes gonna read it and its going to be cringe
[8:33:17] <+witchdoctorpinkish_> Metroid is my favorite nintendo character
[8:33:25] <%fetrigon> woolieGASM woolieGASM woolieGASM
[8:33:29] <Halospaz117> I mean it also meant "Ultimate Warrior"
[8:33:30] <ManfredA> it is now named after her
[8:33:31] <drhivesphd> LUL
[8:33:33] <zenith0111> Not a Retcon
[8:33:34] <%BisoromiBear> wait metroid is a grill?
[8:33:34] <%RealThiele> oh jeez this joke gonna get old
[8:33:36] <+NeonNobleKalzeria> "Ultimate Warrior" was the true title all along
[8:33:36] <%FenixSeraph> Now Metroid can truly crawl
[8:33:37] <miucsa51> LUL LUL
[8:33:38] <kinkade_77> Already outsold samus returns, not that much of a surprise
[8:33:40] <+StriderTempxa> THE Metroid
[8:33:41] <+DatAsuna> Also she's still not the 6ft she rightfully was
[8:33:45] <Shwepie> Metroid means Ultimate Warrior, which accurately describes Samus.
[8:33:47] <jorniev> THE METROID
[8:33:47] <%xeros720> the phrase "the last metroid is in captivity" hits different now
[8:33:48] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Now she is the Ultimate Warrior
[8:33:49] <%Prevot> tho her being huge is probably the bird genes
[8:33:50] <Darren716> I want her name to appear as Metroid in the next Smash
[8:33:52] <jack_s1n> she kinda was one in fusion
[8:33:52] <peachy996> Oh man now the Galactic Fed will really want to capture her
[8:33:52] <+MisterAvry> she's like the ONLY Metroid too, right?
[8:33:54] <Alzero83> Simple?
[8:34:01] <+StriderTempxa> yeah she's the last metroid
[8:34:02] <Alzero83> aint nothign Simple about Samus
[8:34:05] <%Irridium> Can the Metroid DNA make her 7 feet tall
[8:34:06] <Qsmash_> I'm super curious how the Metroid Suit is going to be used in the future
[8:34:08] <Darren716> I mean even before she was a bounty hunter she was half bird
[8:34:09] <Halospaz117> Also, what is her planet kill count now? 5?
[8:34:11] <zealsteele> It must've been really fuckin' hard to balance the amount of cutscenes in this game
[8:34:13] <+Flunkorg> @peachy996 I think they mention that post game she's now wanted
[8:34:14] <%asakura_ayase> Metroid prime 4 starring Metroid as Metroid
[8:34:14] <%RealThiele> the last metroid is hot af, the galaxy is at peace
[8:34:15] <%LastHazzerd> how many planets has Samus blown up now?
[8:34:17] <Darren716> Ok so how many planets is it now?
[8:34:17] <+polothegreatest> LUL
[8:34:21] <Treasure_Vault> Is canon Samus any% SR or 100% SR?
[8:34:26] <CrazyMedicine> @RealThiele LUL
[8:34:28] <Alzero83> Prime 4 I dont think will top this game
[8:34:28] <Darren716> Including prime
[8:34:28] <breadmeng> "The last Metroid is Samus Aran. The galaxy is at peace."
[8:34:29] <KasiCrafter> Power Soup in a Power Suit
[8:34:30] <schoolisforwinners> apparently the developers at nintendo saw the empire strikes back and thought bounty hunter was the word for space adventurer
[8:34:31] <peachy996> @Flunkorg That sounds about right
[8:34:31] <Asuterisuku> Four planets
[8:34:31] <+Flunkorg> @LastHazzerd NOT ENOUGH
[8:34:33] <+StriderTempxa> MAX VAXXER
[8:34:34] <miucsa51> fuck it bring in demons too why not
[8:34:38] <+FrostySoftServe> 3 planets,sr388/zebes/zdr
[8:34:39] <Shwepie> @MisterAvry The Federation had two seperate space science stations cloning metroids. I'm sure they have more.
[8:34:42] <%xeros720> chozo love that shit apparently
[8:34:44] <+Superbro64> Samus is powered by 5GS
[8:34:45] <drhivesphd> WutFace
[8:34:47] <%FenixSeraph> Samus got that 6G juice
[8:34:51] <jagchan> what juice can we put in her next?
[8:34:51] <themightycation> Is she gonna be part Ridley next
[8:34:51] <Halospaz117> We got Zebes, SR388, ZDR, and the Phazon planet
[8:34:51] <Maverick2736> we max-vaxxing over here
[8:34:52] <Darren716> She also destroyed the one in Echos and Prime
[8:34:53] <unrelenting0> And she blew up Phaaze in Prime 3, so Four PLanets.
[8:34:54] <+DatAsuna> "everything was done to make you into a bioweapon"
[8:34:56] <+crossing_mao> METROID/CHOZO CLAN EUGENICS
[8:34:56] <Alzero83> Samus has destroyed every trace of Chozo IN EVERY game @WoolieVersus

[8:35:01] <CrazyMedicine> i wonder how the corrupt part of the federation will handle this news
[8:35:05] <Halospaz117> so 4 or 5
[8:35:05] <+Flunkorg> @WoolieVersus was it all worth it?
[8:35:06] <%RealThiele> SR-388 might not be completely destroyed per a Sakamoto Q&A
