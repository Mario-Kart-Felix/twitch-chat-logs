[0:19:55] <DeebzNutz100> Yo Keits is here? doodChamp
[0:20:05] <Keits> yes hello
[0:20:09] <+itsOnyxLeo> Why doesn't tekken have a tutorial like this?
[0:20:09] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> But Solidus that's worthless because EVERYONE in this chat already owns KI! Right? RIGHT?
[0:20:10] <$Noponiz> oh the game has proxmity normals?
[0:20:10] <%mr_sups> Hi Keits!
[0:20:11] <%Hacerous> Hi Keits!

[0:20:12] <Arek_1> There's 3D fighters (Tekken, SoulCalibur, etc.,) and Mortal Kombat mid. And then there's every other fighting games's mid.
[0:20:19] <@Solidus_113> woolieFABRICATION
[0:20:21] <BusterRepukken> if you dont own KI, get banned
[0:20:29] <DeebzNutz100> doodBro @keits
[0:20:30] <BwdYeti> proximity normals are by character, they're a lot less common in the later characters
[0:20:31] <+tuchpi> KEITS PogChamp
[0:20:36] <%jinking79> man Jago was so broken in Combo Assist
[0:20:40] <BwdYeti> *by character and by button
[0:20:40] <Aussie_Manny> @Keits new stream, who dis?
[0:20:46] <%Hacerous> ffs who doesnt own KI?! BibleThump
[0:20:48] <%Puhff> woolieFABRICATION
[0:20:53] <%mr_sups> Should have saved my story about my Prof who worked on KI for this week.
[0:20:54] <+slayabee> Learn KI. Love KI. Play KI.
[0:20:56] <Tha_Mik> @busterrepukken isnt ki free?
[0:20:57] <$Noponiz> oh, so there are characters with very few/no proximity normals as well?
[0:21:03] <NeroCapone> im guaranteed to get the itch to play KI after this stream
[0:21:06] <Aussie_Manny> @Hacerous the same people who don't own Skullgirls.
[0:21:11] <BusterRepukken> @Tha_Mik not the full game
[0:21:17] <%Hacerous> BibleThump ... true
[0:21:21] <@Solidus_113> I only own season 1 of KI
[0:21:23] <+Zinac> sup
[0:21:25] <+NeoKable_> Yo fight Max!
[0:21:38] <Aussie_Manny> I own vanilla DBFZ and Videl. :P
[0:21:52] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Buying KI has scientifically been proven to raise your happiness levels! Source:me
[0:22:02] <BusterRepukken> KI is on sale right now, no excuse.
[0:22:22] <%Hacerous> if MS didnt have the gifting limitations..
[0:22:29] <+itsOnyxLeo> How much is it?
[0:22:30] <randominternetsurfer> @busterrepukken dont use PC and it ain't on the PS4 :(
[0:22:41] <+itsOnyxLeo> I tried the free version and didn't really care for it
[0:22:49] <@Solidus_113> Killer move to the killer groove
[0:22:58] <BusterRepukken> you got xbox?
[0:23:03] <@Solidus_113> there are autocombos
[0:23:06] <@Solidus_113> it was added
[0:23:07] <BusterRepukken> or nvm i read that wrong
[0:23:12] <+itsOnyxLeo> But that was like, 2 years ago
[0:23:26] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Simpler combos are significantly easier and don't limit you in any way
[0:23:28] <+slayabee> There is an auto combo mode. But combos are relatively easy in this game.
[0:23:37] <%Hacerous> this is assist mode.. didnt know it was in the dojo.. nice
[0:23:47] <+TheBesteban> I talked to DJames about Combo Assist for like 30 minutes the other day. I didn't realize how customizable it could be.
[0:24:02] <+absolutexero11> combos are basically normal button, then special move, then normal button again
[0:24:03] <randominternetsurfer> @busterrepukken no :(
[0:24:06] <Keits> he worked really hard on combo assist
[0:24:13] <Keits> it's a great feature
[0:24:23] <Lolzer82> howdy, folks
[0:24:30] <+slayabee> I really suggest anyone work their way through the tutorial. And try combo assist.
[0:24:32] <%Hacerous> both might be explained?
[0:24:42] <+slayabee> *anyone new
[0:24:44] <+TheBesteban> YEah we talked about it in his interview and then we played a few matches against each other with him using it. It's pretty cool
[0:24:51] <MatTrix77> Thanks to combo assist, I could play with a controller and not feel terrible about myself
[0:24:51] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:24:59] <%Hacerous> its still valid
[0:25:01] <@akuda_bar> @solidus_113 announcer is talking to you Kappa
[0:25:03] <TheWashoutXY> LUL
[0:25:05] <Lolzer82> Is woolie completely new to KI, or does he have some modicum of experience?
[0:25:14] <gordieda20> Combo assist is nice
[0:25:18] <@Solidus_113> why me
[0:25:22] <rheviel> lol
[0:25:28] <%Hacerous> just let assist nuzzle your wuzzle for a bit
[0:25:38] <@akuda_bar> keeps saying SOLID
[0:25:39] <seylumiue> For FUN
[0:25:39] <BwdYeti> combo assist is totally fine
[0:25:41] <Dragon_Batman> LUL
[0:25:42] <Keits> assist is like training wheels
[0:25:44] <@Squdnate> Autocombo's are also easy to spot and break if you know what you are doing
[0:25:46] <rheviel> valid system is valid
[0:25:47] <Enemy_In_Disguise> KI for Fun(Glory)
[0:25:47] <Solidnick18> ok
[0:25:48] <@Squdnate> So it's allll fineeeeeeeeeee
[0:25:48] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> I prefer combo assist because it means I don't have to do a quarter circle motion after every normal
[0:25:49] <%jinking79> from Fun to Glory
[0:25:52] <Keits> you can learn to play with it on
[0:26:01] <Keits> and it never gets in your way
[0:26:02] <Lolzer82> ye combo assist is alright for this game, 'cus even when you're using it, you still gotta do the mindgames
[0:26:09] <%Hacerous> who it?
[0:26:12] <%Hacerous> would*
[0:26:25] <CryptusMaximus> When you say that about easy combos, just address Pat
[0:26:37] <@Solidus_113> Assist combos will get you blown the fuck up if you're fighting someone who knows the game
[0:26:40] <%Hacerous> must easier inputs
[0:26:44] <NemokillerV> @woolieversus Thanks woolie, I legit was worried about you guys shaming me for using the combo assist
[0:27:08] <Keits> similar but good
[0:27:09] <+slayabee> Combos are like sandwiches in KI
[0:27:09] <+absolutexero11> Combos are like making a sandwich!
[0:27:14] <Keits> lots more freedom
[0:27:27] <%Hacerous> combos are more like the precursor to the mind-games
[0:27:29] <SouljaGod420> i mean assist combos are exactly the same as normal ones except without the special move inputs
[0:27:36] <ArbyW> Killer
[0:27:47] <+slayabee> WE LIVIN

[0:27:57] <seylumiue> This tutorial text ia so friendly
[0:27:57] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> This combo system is way smarter than OG KI's
[0:28:00] <+tuchpi> learning :)
[0:28:01] <rheviel> Study mode
[0:28:04] <BwdYeti> big learning
[0:28:12] <@akuda_bar> learning together solving the problems
[0:28:14] <+rosemaryplush> we're learnin and chillin TPFufun
[0:28:16] <Enemy_In_Disguise> Damn now I gotta redownload KI. Forgot how fun this was.
[0:28:16] <gordieda20> SHADOW COUNTER
[0:28:37] <%Hacerous> @Enemy_In_Disguise they always do
[0:28:39] <Lolzer82> I love KI's combo system. You're not just sitting there watching your opponent deal 40%, you can actually do something about it
[0:29:07] <@Solidus_113> it's just an idle animation
[0:29:08] <Orbeii> he got the stanky leg
[0:29:11] <BwdYeti> it's just a fidget animation
[0:29:14] <+slayabee> He's just shaking it out lol
[0:29:14] <BusterRepukken> its an animation
[0:29:14] <+absolutexero11> Hes just digging his foot in
[0:29:18] <Lolzer82> just an idle animation
[0:29:19] <BwdYeti> to break up the idle
[0:29:21] <@akuda_bar> balls stuck to thigh
[0:29:21] <Arek_1> He wiggles it a little.
[0:29:22] <ArbyW> DO DA STANKY LEG
[0:29:23] <Dragon_Batman> Jago is really self conscious about it
[0:29:36] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> It's great! Although I do prefer not being interrupted while I combo @lolzer82
[0:29:37] <SkreamnRedSkull> LOL
[0:29:39] <Orbeii> hes not gonna do it since we're all looking
[0:29:41] <Arek_1> @Dragon_Batman LUL
[0:29:50] <%UrielCobalt> ccccccombo breaker time
[0:29:53] <@Solidus_113> combo enders very important in KI
[0:29:53] <Keits> Jago has two idle animations layered on top of each other that blend semi randomly to make it not look like a cycle. I don't think any other character has that.
[0:29:55] <+slayabee> Its an idle animation Minh
[0:30:03] <+Zinac> I was just about to say that Keits
[0:30:07] <Dragon_Batman> Neat
[0:30:11] <MatTrix77> Jago only does the stanky leg if e's at a BEst Buy
[0:30:14] <Keits> hi chase
[0:30:16] <+absolutexero11> doodUltra doodUltra doodUltra doodUltra doodUltra
[0:30:22] <@Solidus_113> ULTRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

[0:30:28] <Solidnick18> ULTRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
[0:30:32] <+rosemaryplush> ultraaaaaaaaa
[0:30:39] <Lolzer82> @L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N It's certainly nice to pull off a combo you've practiced in the lab for lord knows how long, but it's also nice to get a chance to say "absolutely not, try again" and break it
[0:30:40] <ArbyW> announcer in this game is insane
[0:30:41] <%MayorRev> PogChamp
[0:30:46] <%jinking79> boo this man for missing ender
[0:30:50] <BwdYeti> one step closer to flushing out ultratech
[0:30:51] <Lolzer82> doodUltra
[0:30:58] <%UrielCobalt> the announcer for this series has always been hype
[0:30:58] <%Hacerous> @Keits ty and the team for having the lk+mp & lk+hp shortcuts by far my favorite feature
[0:31:05] <Enemy_In_Disguise> I can’t get mad at someone that double ultras me.
[0:31:06] <+absolutexero11> double roundhouse is a frame trap
[0:31:07] <Solidnick18> yep
[0:31:07] <+TheBesteban> Double Roundhouse is so gooood
[0:31:09] <Dragon_Batman> Good good
[0:31:13] <Keits> same, those were for me 100%
[0:31:16] <DeebzNutz100> doodGood doodGood
[0:31:27] <Keits> I needed them to break quickly on stick lol
[0:31:32] <+absolutexero11> Very plus
[0:31:32] <%Hacerous> ^^
[0:31:33] <BusterRepukken> safe on bloc
[0:31:47] <+tuchpi> woolie LUL
[0:32:00] <Keits> double roundhouse is great until people shadow counter it on reaction
[0:32:00] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:32:07] <Keits> then you realize why it's plus
[0:32:07] <jubejube56> Neck Cutter cuts the spine
[0:32:09] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> @lolzer82 Yeah I understand.
[0:32:26] <+absolutexero11> Fulgore has the same move essentially
[0:32:26] <%Hacerous> teaching lessons, Kreygasm
[0:32:31] <+slayabee> Most to all buttons are special cancelable I believe
[0:32:42] <@Solidus_113> preform mixup
[0:32:50] <Lolzer82> K I L L E R
[0:32:51] <@akuda_bar> there's going to be a pop quiz at the end y'all
[0:32:53] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> I love the text "perform mixup"
[0:32:53] <Keits> except sweeps
[0:32:54] <@akuda_bar> take notes
[0:33:10] <+slayabee> Yeah except sweeps
[0:33:20] <+slayabee> For obvious reasons
[0:33:20] <@Solidus_113> crunchy
[0:33:28] <Lolzer82> cronchy boi
[0:33:38] <TAGMANINK> GivePLZ VoHiYo
[0:33:39] <@akuda_bar> cronch
[0:33:41] <Orbeii> Lov the cronch.
[0:33:42] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> This is satisfying
[0:33:49] <Arek_1> S L A M
[0:33:56] <+absolutexero11> Yo fgc terms
[0:34:00] <BwdYeti> yo tick throws
[0:34:06] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> The animations for some of the characters are just perfect
[0:34:09] <%Hacerous> this game.. taught me fighting games
[0:34:12] <+tuchpi> s ogood
[0:34:13] <Lolzer82> actual fgc terms, hell yeah
[0:34:14] <Solidnick18> oh cool
[0:34:29] <artificiallynatural> KI teaches so much stuff. Every fighting game should take a page out of this game's tutorial
[0:34:33] <+Akizea> ohhhhh fuck its KI time
[0:34:35] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> It's great to see how fighting game tutorials evolved over time
[0:34:44] <@akuda_bar> go back to crunching i was almost there Kreygasm
[0:34:51] <Keits> only 3 characters were not 100% hand animated, we started with mocap
[0:34:52] <+tuchpi> if only more games had the KI training
[0:35:13] <Dragon_Batman> Would be perfect
[0:35:14] <+absolutexero11> I feel like KI was one of the first fighting games to have a truly useful tutorials and how to actually play
[0:35:17] <Keits> I did the mocap performance for Kan-Ra
[0:35:19] <nakunattakage> does anyone else hear weird squeaks when Jago endokoukens?
[0:35:26] <%Hacerous> oh really!
[0:35:26] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Really? Which characters were hand-animated?
[0:35:32] <Dragon_Batman> That's awesome
[0:35:41] <Jetsfantasy> That's super cool, Keits
[0:35:44] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> I mean *not hand-animated
[0:35:51] <+TheBesteban> Is there video of that @Keits?
[0:35:53] <Arek_1> That's why inputting a 5 frame throw after you're +2 on block is a tick throw. And it will beat their 3 frame light normal.
[0:35:53] <+slayabee> Is that why Kan-Ra was so OP in Season 2? Kappa
[0:36:08] <Keits> Sonya from MK1 did Maya the same day. I have a photo of us in mocap suits together
[0:36:12] <@Solidus_113> Kan-Ra? You mean Rick Flair
[0:36:13] <Lolzer82> I do quite like how in-depth this tutorial gets
[0:36:28] <Dragon_Batman> LUL Rick Flair
[0:36:29] <%mr_sups> I am a student one of the animators of the game. He showed us a lot of the process.
[0:36:33] <seylumiue> Its a fantastic tutorial
[0:36:40] <Keits> I don't know of any video. just have the one photo
[0:36:44] <%Hacerous> not gonna lie.. just watching the dojo is making me moar hype than some of the "for glory" vids
[0:36:59] <xiccy> That's super cool, I didn't know she was still doing mocap
[0:37:01] <+absolutexero11> Tekken
[0:37:02] <Lolzer82> Kan Ra? More like Kan Rah shit, I'm fullscreen against this lad, oh shit, oh god, oh fuck lytOUCH
[0:37:24] <olgafl0w> keits can you do me a fav can you and ig help arksys with roll back
[0:37:29] <SkreamnRedSkull> Mocap looks like it would be fun
[0:37:35] <Dragon_Batman> lol
[0:37:49] <+Akizea> i think everyone is hoping that arcsys is actually listening with GGSTrive honestly
[0:38:00] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> There are some games that require relatively precise timing for teching throws, like UNIST
[0:38:13] <Keits> @zinac and I spent a week at my apartment every day after work trying to figure out what to build for Kan-Ra gameplay
[0:38:20] <SheefEatsBeef> those particles my lawd
[0:38:29] <DeebzNutz100> Eat Yo cookie
[0:38:33] <Lolzer82> anyone know if there are any interviews with any programmers for this game? trying to learn how to become a programmer and I feel like this would be a treasure trove of knowledge
[0:38:38] <Keits> @olgafl0w tell them to call us
[0:38:58] <@Solidus_113> Oh god. I just realized the particle effects are going to make the youtube video fucking worthless
[0:39:01] <@Solidus_113> rip bitrates
[0:39:01] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1207129758447939586?s=19
[0:39:01] <Arek_1> Those particle effects are still phenomenal.
[0:39:16] <%Hacerous> doodStare
[0:39:23] <%Hacerous> moar effects!
[0:39:23] <Lolzer82> yo this game goes IN on the particles
[0:39:24] <@Squdnate> @Lolzer82 Max has videos on that. He worked with Iron Galaxy one time doing trailers for them. He did one recently with an old Iron Galaxy dev
[0:39:26] <Jetsfantasy> Yeah, but dear god are the particles gorgeous in person
[0:39:26] <+absolutexero11> KI is particle effects the game
[0:39:27] <+TheBesteban> Streaming encoders be damned
[0:39:28] <@akuda_bar> DoritosChip damage
[0:39:32] <Solidnick18> oh boy
[0:39:45] <Keits> streaming encoders hate these style of particles
[0:39:50] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Cinder vs Cinder is actually what is used to test if your PC is good enough to play the game online
[0:39:53] <Lolzer82> @Squdnate thank ye kindly, I'll go find 'em after this stream lytTHUMBSUP
[0:39:53] <MatTrix77> You've only seen a PARTicle of it
[0:39:56] <+slayabee> UPUPDURKEN
[0:40:06] <rheviel> that Dorito damage
[0:40:08] <%Hacerous> that makes a lot of sense keits
[0:40:24] <@Solidus_113> a better way to do the DP motion is to do forward and then a quarter circle. Much easier than trying to draw a Z on the stick
[0:40:48] <Jetsfantasy> Yeah, that's a good shortcut for most fighting games
[0:40:53] <%Hacerous> Getting into fighting games!
[0:40:56] <BusterRepukken> I draw a letter C for my DPs
[0:41:01] <Keits> remember at Capcom cup when the confetti fell and the stream quality went to shit?
[0:41:02] <Arek_1> That's how it is for SFV after season 1.
[0:41:06] <Keits> same reason
[0:41:07] <Dragon_Batman> LUL
[0:41:19] <Lolzer82> although it wasn't *quite* what I was asking for, but I suppose that interviews where all you get to hear about is coding doesn't make for the most interesting video
[0:41:22] <+TheotherKristian> How I get into fighting
[0:41:25] <BwdYeti> reggie got it
[0:41:28] <blue6sub6remnant6> I just got here and did Reggie pick Jago?
[0:41:34] <@Solidus_113> we're training
[0:41:36] <seylumiue> He probably will lol
[0:41:38] <primaryfire> why would I ever use a medium when heavy does more damage????
[0:41:47] <Jetsfantasy> @blue6sub6remnant6 No, they're just doing training to show the mechanics
[0:41:48] <Lolzer82> @blue6sub6remnant6 just doing training at the moment
[0:41:51] <+absolutexero11> more invincibility
[0:41:57] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Is Reggie going to pick Jago or Shadow Jago? Now that is the real question
[0:41:59] <ArbyW> Because you can't be hurt
[0:42:05] <blue6sub6remnant6> But Reggie is a Ryu main.
[0:42:11] <Arek_1> @primaryfire Damn, Woolie's brother is here. LUL
[0:42:24] <blue6sub6remnant6> I just assumed.
[0:42:32] <ArbyW> Medium DP son
[0:42:34] <primaryfire> LUL
[0:42:34] <%Hacerous> when wk got nerfed... BibleThump
[0:42:43] <ArbyW> It hardens in response to physical trauma
[0:42:50] <+BoBoGaijin> cryDrool cryDrool
[0:42:51] <ArbyW> You can't hurt me, Ken.
[0:42:54] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Remember when EX kick went fullscreen?
[0:42:55] <+the22cstomp> unnerf wind kick
[0:43:00] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Those were the days
[0:43:01] <Keits> the command list in this game is amazing
[0:43:05] <Keits> so much info
[0:43:14] <Lolzer82> I feel like KI is one of the few games where you have actual ass reason to use medium DPs
[0:43:28] <+the22cstomp> combo tool
[0:43:31] <BwdYeti> it's plus on block
[0:43:38] <%Hacerous> high invincible too i think
[0:43:59] <Solidnick18> all good
[0:44:00] <@akuda_bar> i see you all spacing out, pay attention wooliePOYO
[0:44:05] <+the22cstomp> do more
[0:44:06] <+slayabee> I like learning!
[0:44:11] <blue6sub6remnant6> All three are strong options.
[0:44:13] <+slayabee> Learn is good
[0:44:13] <seylumiue> We learned!
[0:44:14] <Zayasu> cant get my arcade stick to work on KI PC FeelsBadMan
[0:44:14] <timinybillybob> Hype Killer Instinct beats to study/ chill to
[0:44:17] <artificiallynatural> but learnbing is funnn
[0:44:18] <Dragon_Batman> This is good, up to you
[0:44:18] <%Hacerous> .. it hurts..
[0:44:18] <Arek_1> What's "plus on block?" Argh, translate down! LUL
[0:44:25] <+BoBoGaijin> cryPbbt cryPbbt cryPbbt
[0:44:26] <ArbyW> As much as I wanna play you guys, learning is important
[0:44:33] <+tuchpi> Woolie overcomplicating the dojo Kappa
[0:44:35] <MatTrix77> Are we not entertained?
[0:44:35] <Solidnick18> i think the basics is good
[0:44:37] <masterofzin> im sure we all need woolies help with this
[0:44:47] <jubejube56> Chat wants ice cream
[0:44:48] <shadytreeofknowledge> sup Woolie
[0:44:50] <+slayabee> You're not done learning the mechanics of the game first
[0:44:51] <Jetsfantasy> @Arek_1 It means that you recover that many frames faster than the opponent. Your moves recovery is faster than their block stun
[0:44:51] <+TheBesteban> Damn, you're putting the couch to sleep
[0:44:53] <primaryfire> learning fighting important
[0:44:55] <%Hacerous> ... just destroy them woolie.. thats the best teacher..
[0:44:58] <%Sparkseid> learning's fun
[0:45:05] <@akuda_bar> ResidentSleeper
[0:45:07] <CryptusMaximus> Fighting Games...For Glun
[0:45:08] <Solidnick18> for fun tho
[0:45:15] <+HerdenDerden> I LOVE WOOLIE
[0:45:16] <shadytreeofknowledge> see ya billy
[0:45:22] <primaryfire> minh would be happy as a brain in a jar
[0:45:23] <ArbyW> Remember the Fisticuffs for Killer Instinct season 2, where they actively told Pat nothing.
[0:45:24] <Jetsfantasy> @Arek_1 Inversely, negative on block means you recover later and are at a disadvantage using that move
[0:45:37] <@akuda_bar> For Glorious Fun
[0:45:41] <%jinking79> it way better performiong it then watchin g it
[0:45:42] <Arek_1> @Jetsfantasy I was kidding. Woolie said to translate down, not up earlier, lol. But you explained it well. Kudos.
[0:45:44] <+tuchpi> Reggie's special labbing time LUL
[0:45:57] <Lolzer82> SourPls
[0:45:57] <jubejube56> Oh we are still a while away

[0:46:13] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:46:17] <Lolzer82> We're still a good few ways until we get into the meat
[0:46:19] <ArbyW> I wanna body the shit out of everyone with TJ
[0:46:40] <Jetsfantasy> @Arek_1 My b, I just figure there's people who don't know here of all places. Hard to know when people are serious or not sometimes
[0:46:59] <+greatgetter> You can turn it off in the options menu
[0:47:00] <%Hacerous> you can go to the combo tutorial i guess.
[0:47:02] <MatTrix77> Character select or Settings
[0:47:05] <ArbyW> I forgot the pause menu played the KI theme
[0:47:07] <transporterthesequel> Woolie desperately trying to learn these bois up before he dumpsters them
[0:47:08] <%generalve> this music woolieSHOOK woolieSHOOK woolieSHOOK woolieSHOOK
[0:47:15] <+HerdenDerden> DO PEOPLE PLAY KI ON PC?
[0:47:17] <%Hacerous> i think it 11
[0:47:24] <Lolzer82> @HerdenDerden yup
[0:47:26] <+absolutexero11> Its combo limit or lesson 11
[0:47:26] <+tuchpi> @HerdenDerden I do :)
[0:47:28] <+slayabee> People play KI on PC
[0:47:30] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> @herdenderden Yes!
[0:47:31] <ArbyW> It's crossplay anyway
[0:47:36] <+tuchpi> ^
[0:47:54] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Enders are super important
[0:48:09] <ArbyW> Enders are you get your damage
[0:48:12] <seylumiue> Press buttons!
[0:48:13] <Lolzer82> The type of ender is also important, but that gets explained soon enough
[0:48:15] <%generalve> TRIPLE
[0:48:39] <Arek_1> Autos are follow-ups. Like Vega's wall dive into slash or Izuna Drop follow-ups.
[0:48:45] <@Menitta> yo KI
[0:49:02] <@Menitta> The best fighting game I'm terrible at
[0:49:02] <Dave_VD> This is sick, I haven't touched this game in forever
[0:49:06] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Hey one question: Why does it seem like they increased the speed of Jago's Ultra with every season?
[0:49:28] <+slayabee> READ
[0:49:35] <Lolzer82> @L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N that's probably just your imagination
[0:49:38] <+slayabee> There you go lol
[0:49:42] <Keits> yeah we didn't
[0:49:57] <Keits> same speed as s1 launch day
[0:50:01] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Really? I must be going crazy
[0:50:05] <%Hacerous> DO IT WOOLIE
[0:50:07] <Orbeii> let's go fighting love?
[0:50:09] <%Hacerous> beat their asses
[0:50:12] <Keits> they are musically timed and hard to change
[0:50:16] <Dragon_Batman> Throw em into the pool to learn to swim then
[0:50:19] <Solidnick18> fight go
[0:50:22] <artificiallynatural> I like how they just let you use whatever moves you wanted for this part of the tutorial. It really helped me internalize what to do and which moves did what
[0:50:22] <@Solidus_113> RASH
[0:50:23] <+TheBesteban> Crush them @WoolieVersus
[0:50:25] <twoto858> COMBO BREAKERS
[0:50:25] <@Menitta> pick Sadira
[0:50:26] <@Solidus_113> RAAM
[0:50:26] <+slayabee> Didn't even learn about Instinct
[0:50:26] <Keits> very overly complicated system
[0:50:27] <blue6sub6remnant6> Okay, now to see if Reggie picks Jago.
[0:50:27] <ArbyW> THROW EM TO THE WOLVES
[0:50:31] <Lolzer82> yo, didn't Hisako have an infinite back in the day?
[0:50:34] <MatTrix77> Murder without learning

[1:34:39] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Quick reminder that this game has the single BEST online guide of ALL TIME. Forgot the link tho...
[1:34:49] <@Solidus_113> It's Keits going to get in there?
[1:34:52] <Solidnick18> gooo
[1:34:52] <@Solidus_113> is*
[1:35:04] <Solidnick18> lol
[1:35:07] <gunsrlove> SQUAD lol
[1:35:25] <BusterRepukken> is he picking someone
[1:35:26] <ArbyW> Why can't I find the lobby?
[1:35:28] <+TeethMuncher> It's lost knowledge
[1:35:28] <%yeknomlive> you're a squad now
[1:35:36] <Solidnick18> oh mira
[1:35:36] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:35:40] <Jetsfantasy> @Squdnate They can't read
[1:35:55] <ArbyW> How does one find the lobby
[1:35:55] <%yeknomlive> I bought this game because of mira and her jack of blades costume
[1:35:57] <%Irridium> @ArbyDMC it's 2 player only so you gotta get lucky when searching
[1:36:07] <BwdYeti> thunder has the sharingan? PogChamp
[1:36:13] <bear_breaker20> 1 day before welfare thunder skin LUL
[1:36:15] <ArbyW> Wow I do not like this lobby system
[1:36:30] <+tuchpi> Thunder can use Susano LUL
[1:36:33] <FullMetalSnorlax> It's not great
[1:36:39] <primaryfire> she really do be living in a society
[1:36:44] <+starpunchghost> Thunder looks like he just walked outta FOTNS
[1:36:48] <Dragon_Batman> Boo bop bee bo
[1:36:53] <@Solidus_113> Big risk Mira
[1:36:54] <ArbyW> I'm surprised it's like this
[1:37:01] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> @dtogo octoNa octoNi
[1:37:02] <FullMetalSnorlax> Netcode A+ Ranked mode A+ Lobbies C-
[1:37:13] <ArbyW> SF4 has better lobbies.
[1:37:20] <ArbyW> amh
[1:37:22] <%Hacerous> it use to be advantageous i think there was an OS with assist on
[1:37:29] <bear_breaker20> thunder left his good shirt at his exes* skin
[1:37:31] <%jinking79> what i missed
[1:37:42] <@Solidus_113> The downside is you get blown up by anyone who actually knows how to play the game
[1:37:47] <ArbyW> Ouch
[1:37:59] <BusterRepukken> COUNTER BREAKERRRR
[1:38:01] <BwdYeti> the only downside is sometimes you might get a move you didn't expect, but that only happens if you messed up an input anyway
[1:38:17] <Goldenwolf98> @ArbyDMC @FullMetalSnorlax you do realize if the lobby is only 2 people that means thats what Woolie set it to and not that their is not larger lobbies right?
[1:38:24] <gunsrlove> POOPA PEEPO
[1:38:25] <FullMetalSnorlax> I played competitively with auto comobo on, just because my thumbs would become sore from repetiitve circle motions
[1:38:28] <ArbyW> Yeah we know
[1:38:38] <ArbyW> But you don't get a list of lobbies
[1:38:44] <ArbyW> it just sends you into one
[1:38:59] <@Squdnate> cant back out
[1:39:00] <DracOmega64> YO KI PogChamp
[1:39:08] <%yeknomlive> ft 2 I guess. send them to losers
[1:39:13] <FullMetalSnorlax> @Goldenwolf98 I know that, there are other issues with the lobbies
[1:39:41] <ArbyW> Auto combos allow you to extend combos in DBFZ
[1:39:42] <BlackermanZX> One of the best themes in KI
[1:39:43] <faqmachine> air autocombo in dragon ball autotracks
[1:39:51] <@Solidus_113> SourPls
[1:39:56] <%jinking79> only way to back out is to quit out the app
[1:40:00] <@Solidus_113> LittleV on the guitar
[1:40:03] <Tha_Mik> SourPls
[1:40:05] <FullMetalSnorlax> @ArbyDMC those are completetly different auto combos
[1:40:12] <ArbyW> What?
[1:40:12] <%yeknomlive> swatcats op
[1:40:29] <laserbeaming> STILL going? You're insane Mr Woolzworth
[1:40:37] <BwdYeti> you can't tell, because the game doesn't judge
[1:40:45] <Dragon_Batman> He took an hour break in between
[1:40:52] <+slayabee> No it doesn't. And it doesn't matter.
[1:41:00] <FullMetalSnorlax> Auto combo in KI is just a input assist, in DBFZ it's a completely different move.
[1:41:07] <ArbyW> Yeah I know.
[1:41:09] <Zayasu> succ Kreygasm
[1:41:17] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> s u c c
[1:41:19] <lem______> yo what's the lobby
[1:41:27] <ArbyW> But they brought up DBFZ and I was clarifying how people still use them in some way.
[1:41:49] <Dragon_Batman> Yea you would
[1:42:06] <ArbyW> Dammit
[1:42:07] <rheviel> too much power in the taunt button
[1:42:19] <Keits> the highest damage combos in KI are the easiest to perform AND the easiest to break. this is why combo assist doesn't provide a real advantage
[1:42:21] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Taunt is OP, please nerf
[1:42:35] <@Squdnate> I could have picked a safer character like Sadina, but I thought Mira would be fun
[1:42:36] <%yeknomlive> thanks keits
[1:42:37] <nothuzad> Keits coming in with the real knowledge :)
[1:42:37] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1207129758447939586?s=19
[1:42:39] <@Squdnate> I haven't played KI in months
[1:42:39] <Keits> most games have combos that get stronger as they get harder. KI does not
[1:42:51] <ArbyW> I keep trying to get in but it's just luck.
[1:42:55] <ArbyW> smh
[1:43:01] <Keits> Hard combos in KI are harder to break, but generally always deal less damage
[1:43:07] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Oh shit RAAM MonkaS
[1:43:19] <Keits> this also means that all combo types are used always. you must mix it up
[1:43:20] <Goldenwolf98> @WoolieVersus Why not just do exhibition if you only do 1 slot both ways its just a random search
[1:43:27] <Keits> if you are repetitive you will be broken
[1:43:43] <BwdYeti> such good game design
[1:43:45] <davey0000> TJ doesn’t get higher damage, the mix just gets more nutty with more advance play.
[1:43:50] <BwdYeti> YEYEYE RIP STREAM
[1:43:50] <+absolutexero11> Rip Stream
[1:43:52] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> Hey! it's Keits!
[1:43:56] <Solidnick18> crill storm
[1:44:10] <Jetsfantasy> Darude Crowstorm
[1:44:14] <laserbeaming> General Raam is cool. I have no idea who he is, I just know he's from Halo, but I like him
[1:44:18] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Grappler that blinds you
[1:44:28] <@Solidus_113> Raam is from Gears, not Halo
[1:44:28] <nothuzad> laserbeaming from gears fo war not halo :)
[1:44:29] <laserbeaming> I meant Geras
[1:44:31] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> @laserbeaming He's frok Gears...
[1:44:34] <Dragon_Batman> He is from Gears of War actually
[1:44:36] <laserbeaming> I always get confused
[1:44:39] <%Irridium> Geras is Mortal Kombat
[1:44:40] <+PapaHaunts> This music is exactly what I think of with these two characters
[1:44:40] <Solidnick18> good stuff
[1:44:42] <nothuzad> arbiter si from halo
[1:44:42] <jubejube56> General raam from minecraft
[1:44:42] <Keits> imo, repetitive confirms and combos and setplay are the enemy of fighting game design
[1:44:42] <%Irridium> LUL
[1:44:43] <laserbeaming> Gears*
[1:44:47] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> It's ok to get confused
[1:44:48] <+tuchpi> LUL
[1:44:52] <laserbeaming> It seems I can't even write today
[1:45:01] <Goldenwolf98> General Ram from Conker Kappa
[1:45:05] <@Solidus_113> MASTER HISAKO
[1:45:08] <@Solidus_113> FEAR
[1:45:10] <Dragon_Batman> It's fine
[1:45:14] <BlackermanZX> we all know Raam is from KH2
[1:45:23] <ArbyW> this lobby system can get bent
[1:45:26] <+slayabee> I wanna play doodSad
[1:45:28] <coreybom> OH FUCK HISAKO 50 WutFace
[1:45:28] <Keits> if everything has a real purpose players make choices instead of confirming into the optimal thing
[1:45:29] <%yeknomlive> Ii
[1:45:31] <davey0000> If Keits is still here, I don’t know how you managed to turn RAAM from big stab guy to one of the most interesting grapplers ever but massive props
[1:45:31] <ArbyW> I'm gettin real angy
[1:45:32] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Raam is from Bomberman 64 duh
[1:45:40] <rheviel> I thought that was an intentional mistake @laserbeaming lol
[1:45:43] <Keits> dking thanks
[1:45:49] <coreybom> REGGIES BOUT TO GET FUCKED
[1:45:57] <Dragon_Batman> Yeyeyeye HIsako
[1:45:59] <@Solidus_113> lvl 50 hisako player here
[1:46:02] <laserbeaming> @rheviel nope, honest, yet hilarious mistake
[1:46:08] <Goldenwolf98> Best female fighting game character
[1:46:18] <Keits> raam is basically sf4 geif with fang poison
[1:46:33] <Solidnick18> posses him
[1:46:42] <Keits> poison is more interesting on a grappler because you have to hit him to stop it and you don't want to be near him
[1:46:43] <%Irridium> god I wish that were me
[1:46:44] <FullMetalSnorlax> Her slashes are not a true block-string. You can jab her between slashes
[1:46:46] <@Solidus_113> do the stage ultra or the ultiamte
[1:46:49] <Keits> so you end up going to him
[1:46:51] <nothuzad> suck me :)
[1:46:59] <+OneGorillionDollars> you can jump the succ
[1:47:03] <davey0000> Curb Stomp otg ing mixups are so cool
[1:47:03] <rheviel> somebody's getting suuuuccc'd
[1:47:07] <+slayabee> Yeah seriously props to Keits and IG for creating some of the most interestingly designed FG characters
[1:47:24] <Keits> poison mechanic on fang isn't very interesting because you want to smother him anyway
[1:47:30] <+the22cstomp> props to keits and IG for making those characters fun AND viable
[1:47:46] <primaryfire> that bar is going in his pension
[1:47:48] <ArbyW> C'mon maaaaaaan
[1:47:51] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Does Raam have any 360 inputs?
[1:47:54] <%Wool> GREEN
[1:47:54] <+the22cstomp> no
[1:47:55] <%yeknomlive> voltron
[1:47:56] <FullMetalSnorlax> KI's graplers are so cool, IF ONLY WE HAD MORE OF THEM
[1:47:57] <Keits> no
[1:48:01] <+the22cstomp> his grab is qcb
[1:48:08] <nothuzad> ye mad props to you and the team Keits - I wish there would be a "remaster" of this for the next xbox generation
[1:48:19] <Keits> only b,f u,d and qcf and dp in this game
[1:48:22] <primaryfire> shadow jago is nuts
[1:48:26] <+slayabee> ^^^
[1:48:28] <Dragon_Batman> LUL
[1:48:36] <%Irridium> arby's theme is fuckin' ace
[1:48:36] <%jinking79> why isn't Woolie playin on Exhibition
[1:48:36] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Interesting, I've always been interested in grapplers but i'm terrible with 360 inputs
[1:48:39] <xiccy> @keits True but I thought the point with Fang was he had enough weird movement that it was supposed to be hard to touch him
[1:48:53] <Keits> d,u*
[1:48:57] <nothuzad> jinking79 woolz doesnt understand lobby systems :)
[1:48:59] <ArbyW> SANGHELIOS BABY
[1:49:12] <Keits> xiccy we've seen that doesn't work in practice for 4 seasons now
[1:49:21] <lem______> yo keits, what are your thoughts on u,d charge/ f,d charge
[1:49:29] <xiccy> @keits True
[1:49:29] <lem______> f,b
[1:49:39] <Keits> it's awkward
[1:49:39] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:49:40] <laserbeaming> Spinal is sick, Love that Skelly Boy
[1:49:44] <davey0000> Charge wouldn’t work for the pace of KI is how I always saw it
[1:49:52] <Keits> and results in many accidental inputs
[1:50:20] <Goldenwolf98> I cant even imagine playing TJ if he was a charge character LUL
[1:50:27] <davey0000> ^^^
[1:50:33] <Keits> charging is fine for this pace
[1:50:36] <Solidnick18> oh no
[1:50:46] <Jetsfantasy> You'd have to charge partition a lot
[1:50:56] <Keits> this game isn't wild fast, it just as a lot of decisions per second
[1:51:10] <coreybom> so Minh is bout to die as well
[1:51:13] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> I suppose charge motions wouldn't work because of the combo system, right?
[1:51:15] <@Solidus_113> yeah
[1:51:19] <%jinking79> oh good luck Minh
[1:51:21] <ArbyW> This is FOR FUN
[1:51:26] <randomness_yo> To bad Max isnt playing against you guys. That guy would love to have a reason to boot up KI
[1:51:30] <BlackermanZX> Oh so minh has chosen death
[1:51:45] <@Solidus_113> Master Shadow Jago
[1:51:45] <%yeknomlive> you guys see that fight of animals

[1:59:17] <Goldenwolf98> @randomness_yo but it wins hearts Kappa
[1:59:21] <randomness_yo> yes it does
[1:59:26] <JaseAdrift> The lobby searching is pretty simple
[1:59:31] <davey0000> @froyuken I forgot there was an actual new Battletoads game and thought of the old meme
[1:59:40] <%Irridium> just gotta get lucky it seems
[1:59:45] <dj_jellocups> anyone know the lobby settings? I'm trying to get in
[1:59:51] <FullMetalSnorlax> Aww man, who will I play when I get in? I want to to show off Gargos and Kahn-ra, but I'm sooo rusty I don't even remember their inputs.
[2:00:00] <Froyuken> @dking0000 You mean that GameStop one? lol
[2:00:02] <JaseAdrift> you have to set the lobby to Woolie's settings
[2:00:04] <Goldenwolf98> @jinking79 he should just be doing exhibition if hes just doing a 2 man lobby really LUL
[2:00:05] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Man remember when you couldn't break air combos?

[2:00:08] <@Solidus_113> Lobby name is "Just for fun"
[2:00:14] <dj_jellocups> thanks solidus
[2:00:26] <blue6sub6remnant6> @dking0000 We haven't gotten any news on the "new game" for like year. What if it's announced to kill the memes?
[2:00:26] <%Irridium> @jase__x I did that and I'm getting all kinds of lobbies that ain't him sadly
[2:00:31] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> No supreme pizza for you
[2:00:39] <JaseAdrift> sadly woolie isn't the only one playing
[2:00:46] <%jinking79> @goldenwolf98 i know right
[2:00:48] <mattgamezz11> perfect stream to have on background while i do work to not fail my class
[2:00:49] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Yo you guys have Battletoads for the Nintendo Wii?
[2:00:52] <ArbyW> Are there any other settings aside from size and name
[2:00:55] <%Irridium> I know how dare these people. Playing this game at this time of day
[2:00:55] <Froyuken> @blue6sub6remnant6 It got a new trailer during E3 but been radio silent ever since.
[2:00:57] <@Solidus_113> stage ultra is on the right side only
[2:01:00] <@Squdnate> Btw. I'm from Denmark, Woolie is Canadian. No noticable lag in the game we played at all. ROLLBACK IS SOO GUD
[2:01:02] <FullMetalSnorlax> If too manny people are searching lobbies, it puts you in as the host
[2:01:05] <JaseAdrift> oh forgot the ultra

[2:07:11] <Guntanks_in_Space> @L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N yea steam can crossplay with xbox live but ranked is separate i think
[2:07:11] <ArbyW> Rollback is incredible
[2:07:14] <%danteSpice_> THE MIXUP
[2:07:14] <davey0000> Opener to Ender
[2:07:20] <ArbyW> My lobby settings are the same as Woolie's
[2:07:24] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Oh I see
[2:07:30] <Guntanks_in_Space> for every shitty SFV rollback story you have KI doing it PERFECTLY
[2:07:44] <davey0000> KI wins again
[2:07:47] <@Squdnate> I said I'm from Denmark, but that's close to Australia I guess haha. Also Max loves to bring up a match he played against a guy from Dubai with 0 lag

[2:09:15] <Froyuken> Back to Rise?
[2:09:17] <@Solidus_113> LVL 50 OMEN
[2:09:17] <Guntanks_in_Space> yea jago not using instinct to heal up is s weird lol
[2:09:19] <@Solidus_113> AHHHHHHHHHH
[2:09:21] <Guntanks_in_Space> BRING ON THE BULLET HELL
[2:09:24] <%Irridium> oh this gonna be good
[2:09:26] <BwdYeti> the unstoppable omen
[2:09:27] <%shmupdogjoe> Did someone say the magic word?
[2:09:27] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> HOW
[2:09:29] <@Squdnate> Level 50 Omen... Time to FEAR
[2:09:30] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> That is a hard MonkaS
[2:09:30] <blue6sub6remnant6> It's time for RNG.
[2:09:32] <%ultrachibi> ultrachibi subscribed with Twitch Prime.
[2:09:39] <laserbeaming> Omen is weird
[2:09:42] <@Solidus_113> actual RNG
[2:09:45] <@Solidus_113> for reals
[2:09:45] <Jetsfantasy> SourPls
[2:09:46] <jubejube56> What if an item character but also edge?
[2:09:49] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Get your lube because otherwise its going to be painful
[2:09:50] <sappinmahbinyot> Rollback is amazing. I can play with people in south america on KoF 2002. I'm thinking that Rollback should also be implemented in non fighting games, like Warframe.
[2:09:51] <davey0000> How do you dodge someone’s fireballs when they have no idea where they’re gonna go?
[2:09:59] <sappinmahbinyot> SourPls
[2:10:00] <%BackwardCap> Omen is a Jago
[2:10:08] <%jinking79> get the 3 fireballs he wanted luck
[2:10:29] <candidateplays> Omen is Kage
[2:10:30] <@Solidus_113> Omen also gets 3 bars of meter, instead of the usual 2
[2:10:40] <davey0000> Hit the demon
[2:10:43] <%danteSpice_> omen is a true oraoraoraora character lmao
[2:10:44] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> That fireball cross up
[2:10:46] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Omen is "another version of Jago" to put it simply
[2:10:48] <Dragon_Batman> DAyum
[2:10:51] <ArbyW> I don't play this game enough.
[2:10:55] <Goldenwolf98> Omen is Faust Kappa
[2:10:55] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:10:56] <%jinking79> r we gonna see tye Grab
[2:11:13] <artificiallynatural> A shame that rollback is still being debated for japanese fighting games. I feel like the industry won't adapt until capcom comes out with a legit good fighting game with rollback and that's gonna be waiting for a while
[2:11:21] <sappinmahbinyot> How are these characters so unique? Oh my lord, it's awesome.
[2:11:23] <%mr_sups> Omen is Hero
[2:11:28] <TomCrimson> @ArbyDMC hol up
[2:11:29] <laserbeaming> 5 different colored Omens might make a good Sentai Team
[2:11:34] <ArbyW> I wonder if rollback would've saved Marvel Infinite
[2:11:40] <artificiallynatural> rollback is in infinite
[2:11:41] <nothuzad> artificiallynatural GG passing up on GGPO now that it has been pushed int heir feedback paper would be so miserable
[2:11:47] <Dragon_Batman> It had great online
[2:11:49] <ArbyW> Oh is it actually good rollback
[2:11:53] <+slayabee> You can charge fireballs with Jago @woolieversus
[2:11:57] <artificiallynatural> yes, it's a huge improvement over SFV
[2:12:00] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Rollback doesn't save games, unfortunately
[2:12:08] <@Squdnate> You gotta remember that rollback also needs to be done correctly. Because SF5 has rollback, but it's so poorly done
[2:12:15] <@Squdnate> also ULTRA HOIPE
[2:12:17] <+absolutexero11> PogChamp
[2:12:18] <Dragon_Batman> The visuals and lack of a roster to grab people is part of what did it
[2:12:18] <BwdYeti> good enough
[2:12:19] <nothuzad> L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N it doesnt save games but ti saves communities

[2:14:06] <@Squdnate> I play on the Windows 10 bersion
[2:14:07] <+FrostedZaibatsu> Does the steam version work with xbox?
[2:14:13] <NicholasOsen_> win10 verison of KI is the best verison
[2:14:14] <BwdYeti> win10 thing isn't GFWL
[2:14:17] <artificiallynatural> all versions have crossplay no?
[2:14:20] <davey0000> Not on ranked but test with everything else
[2:14:21] <%Irridium> @FrostedZaibatsu yep
[2:14:21] <@Squdnate> Yes
[2:14:23] <%shmupdogjoe> lets see those danmakus, Hellfire_Star!
[2:14:27] <@Solidus_113> Yeah, on the Windows Store/GamePass version you just login to your Xbox account and it'll have the save
[2:14:42] <@Squdnate> Crossplay is segmented to PC and Xbox. No matter where you buy KI on PC from
[2:15:08] <davey0000> Xbox Live uses a different leaderboard system than Steam so you won’t be able to ranked play against Xbox Players
[2:15:09] <ArbyW> How do you break Shadow moves
[2:15:11] <artificiallynatural> my only worry getting KI would be if I could run the online on my shitty laptop
[2:15:25] <Froyuken> KIIIING Combo.
[2:15:33] <davey0000> 123 in Rythm with the shadow move
[2:15:45] <%Irridium> Yeah this was sadly before they let you keep saves between platforms. Gears 5 and Halo Reach both let you transfer saves between versions since you have to sign into your XBL tag for PC
[2:15:46] <laserbeaming> there's a really nice benchmark for that @artificiallynatural
[2:15:54] <ArbyW> One two three with every set of buttons?
[2:15:58] <laserbeaming> in-game benchmark
[2:16:00] <%jinking79> to bad Ki couldn't get Mods
[2:16:03] <davey0000> Mediums
[2:16:14] <ArbyW> k
[2:16:15] <davey0000> 3 mediums amongst the five shadow hits
[2:16:25] <+tuchpi> LUL
[2:16:30] <artificiallynatural> @laserbeaming yeah, I tried out the demo and tested the online but my computer couldn't handle it
[2:16:30] <%Irridium> LUL
[2:16:35] <jubejube56> Lol I like that the Killgore was playing around Shin's instinct command grab and Minh had no clue what was going on
[2:16:49] <laserbeaming> Riptor!
[2:16:50] <BwdYeti> you don't even have to kick, just hit B so you're not readied
[2:16:56] <@Solidus_113> you can't leave in character select
[2:16:59] <laserbeaming> Riptor best girl
[2:17:00] <%shmupdogjoe> There's a Primal Rage joke in here somewhere
[2:17:02] <%jinking79> again why aren't y'all doing this on Exhibition
[2:17:02] <ArbyW> I'm not sure if TJ's command grab is reactable or if the dude just mashed
[2:17:06] <Froyuken> Riptor's a gud gurl.
[2:17:13] <@Squdnate> Couldnt leave in character select. Didnt know the countdown timer was so short, so didnt get out in time

[2:17:30] <artificiallynatural> I love how there's just dinosaurs in every fighting game. SFV gotta catch up with the times
[2:17:35] <davey0000> You can plink TJ’s Combo from Powerline to get Powerlines armor iirc
[2:17:38] <primaryfire> hinnamatoom is so fucking good
[2:17:45] <%shmupdogjoe> I guess Justice is *like* a dinosaur...
[2:17:53] <%shmupdogjoe> What's up with Riptor's tail though?

[2:45:57] <%shmupdogjoe> I see. The way to use a bow and arrow in battle is get right in the other guy's face. That way you can't miss and you can also use the arrows for combo
[2:46:00] <FullMetalSnorlax> Fulgore has the same moove, because they have history together

[3:02:15] <%mr_sups> Kan Ea is evil as fuck. But independent.
[3:02:16] <%Irridium> evil looking neutral
[3:02:23] <BwdYeti> compared to gargos basically no one is evil
[3:02:36] <+CrackedPipe457> Chaotic neutral?
[3:02:41] <@Menitta> Kan Ra would totally barf in a stranger's purse

[3:04:19] <guymontag0> She’s the American Dragon
[3:04:21] <%drefizz> don't hate me
[3:04:23] <%shmupdogjoe> there is something fundamentally *wrong* about a fighting game where a werewolf isn't the one weilding nunchucks. Just saying
[3:04:30] <+Tntwelve> no lol
[3:04:52] <%drefizz> @shmupdogjoe I get your reference
[3:05:05] <+absolutexero11> John Talbain
[3:05:11] <Captain_Aham> wooo saw, something something jago, something something kanwa, something something jago
[3:05:20] <primaryfire> the white part of the healthbar gets cashed in when you end combos properly
[3:05:39] <jubejube56> Seriously why did they think John Talbain needed nunchucks?
[3:05:48] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> There's something fundamentally wrong about a game where the protagonist doesn't turn into a dragon halfway through the fight and combos you to death
[3:05:49] <jubejube56> Were nunchucks just cool with kids?
[3:05:51] <guymontag0> It’s cool
[3:05:56] <lem______> ggs zinmaster
[3:05:59] <@Solidus_113> WOOOOO

[3:09:48] <Dragon_Batman> The Steal a soul match was really good
[3:09:48] <+TheBesteban> He tried to steal Becky Lynch's soul one time
[3:09:51] <+TheBesteban> It was scary
[3:09:51] <guymontag0> @jinking79 Couldn’t Eyedol Kill himself with the self punch?
[3:09:53] <Guntanks_in_Space> Ric Flair overcame his surgery by a big Soulnado
[3:09:57] <+RichHoboInVegas> Have we seen Eyedol yet?

[3:11:40] <sappinmahbinyot> This is how KoF girls seem to Ralf and Clark in KoF 13.
[3:11:43] <+absolutexero11> Eyedols alternate costumes are really good
[3:12:13] <%jinking79> IG made Eyedol really cool
[3:12:24] <%jinking79> even his Classic
[3:12:27] <sappinmahbinyot> But in all honesty fighting games need more huge charcters
[3:12:44] <@Solidus_113> we have plenty of huge characters
[3:12:45] <+absolutexero11> Big Bois are always welcome
[3:12:51] <candidateplays> Eyedol switches at random
[3:12:59] <sappinmahbinyot> big bois are fuckin awesome
[3:13:03] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Guilty Gear 2020 needs accurate-size Justice as a playable character
[3:13:07] <+absolutexero11> He's more likely to switch when you use more special moves
[3:13:13] <jubejube56> Switches randomly after using a special move I believe

[3:27:41] <CryptusMaximus> Keith David as a fighting game guest isnt until next March.
[3:28:06] <Dragon_Batman> LUL
[3:28:10] <guymontag0> Because they are off the wall. They could’ve easily just gotten Master Chief and Marcus Fenix but they went with some weirdos instead
[3:28:15] <BwdYeti> you have to use a super or instinct to get shields
[3:28:17] <sappinmahbinyot> Dear god I forgot how far awayt Spawn is
[3:28:19] <sappinmahbinyot> why did you ahve to remind me?
[3:28:26] <+the22cstomp> because IG is good at choosing everything
[3:28:36] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Marcus Fenix would honestly be weirder tbh
[3:28:38] <%yeknomlive> yes dude
[3:28:40] <primaryfire> he has to activate the shields by spending 1 bar

[3:32:20] <CryptusMaximus> @l_a_s_e_r_m_a_n yeah no, Jason Voorhees snuck his way into this game too I guess LUL
[3:32:34] <+MrRgrs> Halo is in KI?

[3:43:05] <rheviel> saaaaaad drop
[3:43:17] <%damienlunas> Woolie have you heard the news of "Fight of Animals: Legend of the Strongest Creature" the hot new fighting game
[3:44:10] <%damienlunas> With such characters as Magic Squirrel and Muscle Beluga
[3:44:41] <rheviel> FoA:LotSC you say
[3:45:18] <artificiallynatural> Muscle Beluga looks like something straight out of my nightmares
[3:45:22] <StarvingPenguinGod> PogChamp
[3:45:25] <%damienlunas> According to a tweet it has functional rollback netcode
[3:45:58] <primaryfire> oh wow
[3:46:00] <+Cerberus_NV> Benny PogChamp
[3:46:02] <%shmupdogjoe> Between that and Fighting Herds, are we at a full 50% of games with rollback netcode being animal-based?
[3:46:09] <@Solidus_113> Reminder Max made official trailers for this game
[3:46:09] <FortuneEX> doodBenny
[3:46:10] <%yeknomlive> doodBenny
[3:46:10] <%drefizz> max did work on the game
[3:46:11] <artificiallynatural> The cat is the worst
[3:46:18] <DedlokPM> doodBenny doodBenny2 doodBenny3
[3:46:28] <SpookyBeef7> I think Max helped edit the trailers?
[3:46:36] <+Tntwelve> Benny boy!
[3:46:53] <%yeknomlive> he made them
[3:46:54] <primaryfire> banger alert
[3:47:06] <zenith0111> So he was a grunt employee for the game? LUL
[3:47:25] <SpookyBeef7> More like a freelancer they hired.
[3:47:26] <+tuchpi> he was in charge of the story
[3:47:35] <Dragon_Batman> He worked with Mick Gordon on the pacing of them too
[3:47:38] <+FrostedZaibatsu> So, Max got into a car accident today. If you didnt hear
[3:47:47] <SpookyBeef7> Shit, is he okay?!
[3:47:47] <yeknomlive> thank god they're both ok
[3:47:52] <%yeknomlive> him and jj are ok
[3:47:53] <primaryfire> he's fine
[3:47:57] <Dragon_Batman> Luckily yea they seem to be ok
[3:48:00] <%yeknomlive> car's wrecked tho
[3:48:18] <primaryfire> that ain't fine
[3:48:20] <zenith0111> That's why you buy the good cars
[3:48:24] <guymontag0> It was cause of a truck merging, right? Glad they’re okay.
[3:48:27] <%damienlunas> Aganos reminds me of Gold Lightan from TvC. I wrecked with Gold Lightan except for the fact that Tekkaman Blade is an actual 9-1 matchup against him.
[3:48:27] <zenith0111> You live at least
[3:48:48] <SpookyBeef7> Of course it was a truck driver. They literally give no shits.
[3:48:50] <+Tntwelve> What?
[3:49:13] <Man_in_the_Red> @spookybeef7 they're busy reconnecting america 4Head
[3:49:23] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> YEAH TRUCKIN'
[3:49:29] <%damienlunas> Woolie, thoughts on Fight of Animals: Legend of the Strongest Creature?
[3:49:41] <zenith0111> @spookybeef7 Driving for hours on end sometimes through morning to night. No wonder some people consider drones
[3:49:43] <@Solidus_113> Wulf has so many cancels
[3:49:45] <+FrostedZaibatsu> When i drove across America i almost had one merge on me. Thankful i saw the lights and acted quickly
[3:49:52] <+FrostedZaibatsu> Theyre scary

[3:51:37] <primaryfire> tj has the mechanic where you hit all 6 buttons without repeats
[3:51:42] <@Solidus_113> We haven't seen a Fulgore Hypebeam yet tonight
[3:51:44] <%yeknomlive> i want to get a big battop for mine. the first one i got was tiny
[3:51:44] <Man_in_the_Red> what ever happened to the doodBenny colors
[3:51:47] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Of course it is @damienlunas
[3:51:51] <zenith0111> @damienlunas No such things as bad publicity when you're starting out LUL
[3:52:03] <guymontag0> I feel bad for Freddy. Of all the times he could have died, it had to be the time he had that ugly sweater on.
[3:52:27] <Dragon_Batman> LUL
[3:53:20] <Man_in_the_Red> man, you know you've created a monster when they surpass Ino in mixups
[3:53:54] <Man_in_the_Red> on the bright side Shadow Jagos dont know where they teleport either Kappa
[3:54:01] <boski_szumi> hi
[3:54:10] <+tuchpi> PogChamp
[3:54:11] <BwdYeti> nice
[3:54:25] <%damienlunas> Remember the time they felt the need to explain that Freddy is so evil because was conceived in an Insane Asylum Gangbang
[3:54:32] <%drefizz> I've had someone ultra on me for a straight 10 minutes with hisako
[3:54:36] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Hey by the way guys, if you do the wallsplat ender, it already puts you into position for a crossup for some characters, so you can do some sick resets @woolieversus
[3:54:56] <%shmupdogjoe> I miss the days when you could just be evil without needing to have a traumatic origin story
[3:54:58] <%drefizz> wait no that was a video I watched....

[3:58:19] <boski_szumi> wtf dude, its early af I just woke up, 2 hours from now and im in work
[3:58:35] <%shmupdogjoe> Thanks to the power of the internet, Timmy doesn't actually have any friends. Maybe he'll grow out of it before he's 30
[3:58:54] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Ok this hits a bit too close to home
[3:58:55] <zenith0111> Chats projecting their own life problems LUL
[3:58:57] <+tuchpi> forsenHappy
[3:59:07] <%shmupdogjoe> Nah, I don't bully people on the internet
[3:59:12] <rheviel> calling me out
[3:59:14] <boski_szumi> who's Timmy?
[3:59:27] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> You dont wanna know whos Timmy
[3:59:28] <%shmupdogjoe> He's teh boy assistant from a science show on the old sitcom Dinosaurs
[3:59:30] <artificiallynatural> Instead of making friends, Timmy can threaten to feed if he doesn't get mid.
[3:59:39] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> LUL
[3:59:39] <%shmupdogjoe> The classic line was, "We need another Timmy!"
[3:59:44] <Dragon_Batman> I'm shure there is someone named timmy among his followers
[3:59:55] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Timmy is a war criminal
[4:00:06] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Wanted in more than 7 countries
[4:00:15] <artificiallynatural> JAPAN PLEASE
[4:00:17] <Dragon_Batman> What the hell was MGS 4's line, War never changes?
[4:00:22] <primaryfire> timmy brews white phosphorous in his spare time
[4:00:25] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> But through the power of the internet
[4:00:30] <rheviel> This was a great game session, it should always be this good.
[4:00:30] <blue6sub6remnant6> Japan continues to only care about Japan.
[4:00:32] <+eanscrale> GGPNO
[4:00:34] <artificiallynatural> MGS4 was War has changed. War never changes is Fallout
[4:00:40] <Dragon_Batman> Aaah
[4:00:44] <Man_in_the_Red> @artificiallynatural ^
[4:00:47] <+Superbro64> you got to answer with your wallet I suppose
[4:00:55] <artificiallynatural> with straaaaands
[4:00:58] <+tuchpi> GGPO is Chiral
[4:01:02] <zenith0111> Rollback is really complicated from everything I researched.
[4:01:04] <BwdYeti> create a chiral network for maximum netcode
[4:01:09] <Dragon_Batman> We need a cut of GGPO into different scenes in Death Stranding
[4:01:13] <boski_szumi> so Timmy is not a person but some abstract idea about person that represent some collection of behaviors ?
[4:01:13] <+eanscrale> You could say it's what we're strIVing for.
[4:01:20] <zenith0111> MVCI probably looked that bad so the netcode could handle the graphics...
[4:01:20] <artificiallynatural> but other people have figured out rollback already so you just need to implement it
[4:01:21] <@Solidus_113> Also Crossplay
[4:01:21] <+Superbro64> rollback is not very complicated
[4:01:25] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> GGPJust buy Guilty Gear losers
[4:01:28] <lujme> "japan wanta connect japan. i guess everything else too idk"
[4:01:33] <zenith0111> Graphics are the biggest problems
[4:01:40] <%damienlunas> You need to buy Fight of Animals to show Japan that you want fighting games with Rollback Netcode FrankerZ
[4:01:41] <%yeknomlive> are we the homodemons
[4:01:53] <randomness_yo> good night!
[4:01:56] <%shmupdogjoe> UNO?
[4:01:58] <+Superbro64> as keits said, putting netcode in your game isnt easy, so you might as well do the next step and put rollback in
[4:01:58] <Dragon_Batman> Good stuff, Bye guys
[4:01:59] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> @zenith0111 What are you talking about?
