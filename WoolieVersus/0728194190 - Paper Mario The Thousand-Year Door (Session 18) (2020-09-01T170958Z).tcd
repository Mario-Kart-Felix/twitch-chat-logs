[0:30:44] <+Superbro64> yall dont need much chat
[0:30:57] <Parapattern> Man, Woolie's shirt reminds me how much I miss going to the Alamo Drafthouse in Austin.
[0:31:02] <%chosenjuan42> Car people are just like PC people
[0:31:07] <+Superbro64> diminishing returns is the name of the game
[0:31:08] <%gatorafan> I have the same LG monitor I bought like 10 yesrs ago daedra1DerpyTibs
[0:31:13] <%JustYudha> Ew 720p
[0:31:18] <+Superbro64> @gatorafan seemsGood
[0:31:19] <%gatorafan> The rest of my PC is pretty up to date.
[0:31:24] <%sporeian94> I've been using the same PC since 2013, I want a new game
[0:31:34] <Papa_Bearman> For a year, I REALLY wanted to build a gaming PC, and now that I've built one, I have no desire to build one.
[0:31:35] <%JetpackMcQuack> Bare minimum SeemsGood
[0:31:39] <%EdibleKnees> EdibleKnees is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to WoolieVersus's community! They've gifted a total of 1 in the channel! 
[0:31:39] <@akuda_bar> @Parapattern but no really, is reggie wearing a shirt of his own face or am i crazy
[0:31:40] <%EdibleKnees> EdibleKnees gifted a Tier 1 sub to Superbro64! 
[0:31:41] <%Superbro64> still have a shitty $20 dollar keyboard thats been lasting me for 6 doodGood
[0:31:54] <%DatAsuna> I enjoy the process but lack the money to buy new parts. However work usually gives me the chance to take apart and rebuild workstations often enough and that's fun
[0:31:56] <%Chatterbox1991> I spent 600 or 700 on a cyber gaming rig just to avoid this argument
[0:32:02] <Parapattern> @akuda_bar Holy shit, I just noticed
[0:32:02] <%gambit_gamble> goal make number big
[0:32:13] <%cobalt_phoenix_> fuckin denuvo man
[0:32:16] <Papa_Bearman> The hobby is too expensive for me to have.
[0:32:21] <%Bosni9> Fraction Frog from video was üëå
[0:32:23] <%Irridium> I built one a while ago and just as time goes on added/changed stuff out one at a time over the years. it's really just about how hard you want to go, and you don't need to go as hard as you think
[0:32:31] <SiegeJay> Its like Building a Yugioh deck. Do you need Linkcross so you can make you combo board bigger when your opponent will just Imperm it
[0:32:33] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> He may or may not finish
[0:32:35] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Oh its endgame time
[0:32:40] <redmage216> doubt
[0:32:40] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> I think one more sesh
[0:32:40] <+dukeofhammer> probably not
[0:32:45] <WarKamex> I'd say one or two more
[0:32:46] <Drusain> not today definitely
[0:32:49] <el_biribon> no way he finishes it today
[0:32:49] <%Th3SmartAlec> PogChamp
[0:32:53] <+Ancopro> pretty sure you got two left
[0:32:53] <%ringabal> RUH ROH
[0:32:55] <%chosenjuan42> HOLDING
[0:32:55] <%TitaniumDragoonNeo> Yeah, if this is a 4-5 hour stream, you'll likely finish.
[0:32:57] <%BallerSwagBro9k> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[0:32:57] <exnuart> thats a yes
[0:33:00] <%BallerSwagBro9k> OH NO
[0:33:01] <el_biribon> at least 8h of content left and thats only story mode
[0:33:02] <%DatAsuna> I haven't played yu-gu-oh in person for like 8 years but I keep up the deck anyways lol
[0:33:05] <%Solidnick18> PogChamp
[0:33:05] <@akuda_bar> there's no way he would finish today, definitely not
[0:33:18] <%Th3SmartAlec> No way
[0:33:21] <dinnydanny777> That turn based Return of the King game on PS2 was really good
[0:33:22] <Parapattern> UUUUUGH
[0:33:24] <%JetpackMcQuack> Public domain 4Head
[0:33:24] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> You mean LotR 4?
[0:33:25] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUP
[0:33:26] <exnuart> did he finish chapter 7 yet?
[0:33:27] <%wunp_fxs> it started strong
[0:33:31] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> there was a 2 AND a 3
[0:33:32] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:33:36] <%sporeian94> Remember that shitty Battlefront style game for LOTR
[0:33:37] <%Solidnick18> oh wooooow
[0:33:38] <%DatAsuna> and there was a laura bailey ninja eld
[0:33:43] <Meltgar> Remember the MOBA of LotR Kappa
[0:33:45] <el_biribon> he would finish it in like 3h if he was mashing tru text and stuff but they are enjoying the ride
[0:33:50] <%chosenjuan42> he still on ch7
[0:33:51] <%Th3SmartAlec> Stop trying to take over a work superior to yours
[0:33:51] <Parapattern> Just let JJR Tolkien rest in peace
[0:33:54] <SiegeJay> Star Wars, LoTR, GoT, Last of Us, and Doctor Who
[0:33:57] <Parapattern> *JRR
[0:34:01] <dinnydanny777> But they aren't even making Lord of the Rings, they're making "a game set in the universe of"
[0:34:02] <%sporeian94> Ghostbusters reboots
[0:34:03] <%Th3SmartAlec> TERMINATOR LUL LUL LUL
[0:34:03] <%DatAsuna> Fame = big monies
[0:34:03] <%JetpackMcQuack> Let mickey die
[0:34:06] <Papa_Bearman> ...Did chat crash?
[0:34:08] <%chosenjuan42> NOSTALGIA SELLS
[0:34:08] <%ringabal> HEY KIDS, DID YOU KNOW SPENDING MONEY IS COOL
[0:34:10] <Papa_Bearman> OK, didn't think so.
[0:34:11] <ali_dragonight> oh I know the shaier land farming sim next LoTR game
[0:34:27] <exnuart> how far in? i had to tune out and forgot tto catch up as soon as he got on the moon
[0:34:36] <BlackermanZX> gotta milk the cash cow
[0:34:39] <%DatAsuna> I think the first shadow of mordoor had a bunch of gollum shit too
[0:34:39] <%Irridium> but you don't understand, it brings in money. so if you keep releasing, you will keep making money. It's fullproof!
[0:34:41] <%sporeian94> Well there is an Amazon LOTR series coming out
[0:34:41] <+dmtjinni> I wish I could watch the stream in gym :(
[0:34:45] <Parapattern> The iron has been dipped in liquid nitrogen
[0:34:51] <%Th3SmartAlec> Ok, but when's my Tom Bombadil character action game though?
[0:34:52] <Meltgar> Where's my LotR fighting game?! PogChamp
[0:34:59] <@akuda_bar> @Meltgar okay but actually
[0:34:59] <Prevot> I still don't understand why they tried to make a new charlies angels movie
[0:35:01] <dinnydanny777> At least the Silmarillion is actually something new
[0:35:04] <%JetpackMcQuack> Then fall guys comes along
[0:35:10] <%DatAsuna> XCOM 2 stealing that system was the best possible outcome
[0:35:23] <auso912> they should make LOTR games based on the other books
[0:35:30] <Parapattern> Silmarillion fighting game
[0:35:32] <+Loinclothiclese> the shadow games werer rad
[0:35:44] <+Loinclothiclese> the stand was celebrimbor
[0:35:45] <auso912> i'd play that lol @Parapattern
[0:35:46] <%Th3SmartAlec> But then they would have to read those books, Woolie
[0:35:48] <exnuart> the sttand was the maker of tthe rings
[0:35:51] <%chosenjuan42> All these Nostalgia anual movies are like those games where the developer says new people can join in on the 6th movie but then everyone is lost
[0:35:59] <%Irridium> stand was kellogs blueberry
[0:36:21] <auso912> i'd main Werewolf sauron
[0:36:32] <Meltgar> Shadow of war and the RTS games were really good
[0:36:33] <dinnydanny777> What characters would you put in a LoTR fighting game and would you put humans or the deific creatures
[0:36:40] <%BallerSwagBro9k> woolieFUN
[0:36:47] <+Rekinsinn> @dinnydanny777 whynoboth
[0:36:55] <GenericSoda> The expansion has some wild haunts where there isn't a traitor
[0:37:01] <%TitaniumDragoonNeo> Those Shadow of War/Mordor games delve into an era that Tolkien never addressed.

[0:43:10] <+Loinclothiclese> @DatAsuna yea cause it was massive
[0:43:13] <@Solidus_113> Most pizza places that use hot sauce just use tobasco, it sucks
[0:43:23] <CrimsonGargoyle> spoken nothing but the @Clear_Truth ma man Keepo
[0:43:26] <dinnydanny777> The more toppings you put on a pizza the more likely you are to get a pizza where the cheese is stuck to the roof of the box :)
[0:43:31] <Meltgar> @Loinclothiclese Yeah, i was wondering why it was folded if it was pizza LUL
[0:43:37] <Louie_Salmon> This is pizza-eating music

[0:45:30] <%RadicalWeegee> OK WELLL FLAT BREAD pizza is perfect for that
[0:45:34] <%Irridium> "harder"
[0:45:35] <exnuart> crunchy is how the dough is made not cooked
[0:45:35] <@Solidus_113> crunchy pizza sucks ass. that shit scrapes your gums
[0:45:36] <dinnydanny777> If you get a spicy pizza cooking it well done makes it more flavourful
[0:45:38] <Papa_Bearman> How about an infinite pizza where the crust and the sauce is also cheese?
[0:45:46] <dizimous> You can cook it more maybe, but not less
[0:45:48] <%chosenjuan42> stuffed crust is bomb
[0:45:49] <+TuskAct4> Some places you gotta order it well done just to get the dough cooked right
[0:45:49] <%RadicalWeegee> burtal ;0;
[0:45:51] <dinnydanny777> Well done Jalapeno pizza is good
[0:45:54] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @Solidus_113 Word gimme soft crust any day

[0:46:00] <Papa_Bearman> I thought Reggie invented cheese in the crust?
[0:46:01] <dinnydanny777> Cold pizza is so good
[0:46:02] <Clear_Truth> I had a pizza where they used curry instead of tomato sauce and it was hands down the best pizza I've had in a while.

[0:47:54] <%Solidnick18> lol

[3:08:38] <%HeroVersusOfficial> Cheer500 Mario uses Supernova, then we wait for 12 minutes for a meteor to strike the sun and destroy everything. Also, Reggie, hypothetically, if you happened to be a fighter, what kind of fighter would you be? Perhaps someone that lets you seal and copy your opponents attacks, allowing you to slowly and methodically break down your opponents by using their own attacks against them and denying them their attacks. No martial art, no technique, is beyond your capability to replicate.

[3:17:59] <+Ancopro> they're paper he just slipped ion
[3:17:59] <%HeroVersusOfficial> PogChamp500 Of course unlike the usual methods, Reggies copies of the moves won't be weaker variations. In fact, they will be amped up versions, and will force the enemy to have the weakened variation for a short while. The only downside is the limited usage of it... He can replicate any technique, but not for long. Likewise, he holds no techniques of his own, so his greatest force will be that of his enemy. "I'm not just better than you... I'm you, but better." - Reggie, the Canadian Chimera.

[3:19:25] <cosmicgoatee> you would be correct Woolie
[3:19:29] <%Asuterisuku> Point of No Return, I think.
[3:19:31] <%chosenjuan42> cook mushrooms with syrups to save space in inventory
[3:19:32] <+skyheys> You can do it later.

[3:19:40] <+zooeymainbtw> I agree
[3:19:41] <SomersaultJustice> don't tell him Kappa
[3:19:42] <Nomad94> no such thing as a point of no return
[3:19:43] <Mr_Strut> You can come back, but this is a good time
[3:19:44] <pmmori> @WoolieVersus this is the end game, but the pit has enemies even harder than enemies in the end game
[3:19:44] <dromemer3> lets gooooooo!!!!!
[3:19:45] <Cynical_Canadian> Pretty much, you can leave the final area, but you gotta backtrack if you want to do that
[3:19:45] <CrematedCube> There is a post-game
[3:19:47] <%chosenjuan42> there is post game
[3:19:49] <exnuart> there is a pseudo post game
[3:19:49] <Louie_Salmon> Eh, probably a good time for it anyway
[3:19:51] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> There is no PONR, but it's fine either way
[3:19:54] <missingangle> There's post game which you can absolutely do it at
[3:19:59] <pmmori> you can do pit in post games
[3:20:00] <Ambiguous_Anti> @Nomad94 oh really? Try going back to the moon base.
[3:20:02] <Blunder_Blue> This is endgame, but there's a postgame so you can do the pit then.
[3:20:05] <+MagiKestral> there is a post game that has a GREAT sidequest, would recommend
[3:20:06] <%Th3SmartAlec> Ojoh sama ghost
[3:20:12] <Ecliptic_Origins> monkaS
[3:20:19] <%Jaysky> Post game baby
[3:20:22] <CrematedCube> Either way, before or after, it's totally fine
[3:20:23] <+linSP> you CAN do pit postgame but you can also do it after chapter 1
[3:20:27] <%chosenjuan42> 100 pit trial you will fight toughest enemies
[3:20:29] <Nomad94> @Ambiguous_Anti the what? no such thing as a moon base Kappa

[3:25:14] <pmmori> you can't skip
[3:25:14] <Spydurman> Cheer500 Hey Woolz heard you talk about Age of Empires on the podcast yesterday, have you checked out AoE 2 Definitive Edition? Came out last year and is super popular, even had a tourney with a $50k prize pool. Could make for a fun one off stream
[3:25:15] <Drusain> There are troubles I think
[3:25:18] <Cynical_Canadian> I think the pit's boss is harder than the final boss?
[3:25:19] <GooseyGanderer> Nope.avi
[3:25:20] <+zooeymainbtw> it is very difficult
[3:25:23] <%Solidnick18> yeah then you have to do 50
[3:25:25] <dromemer3> start a 1
[3:25:26] <%bread_assassin> I'm all for having the final boss being the last thing you do in the game.
[3:25:27] <DukeBlack_> you can beat the pit in the beginnig of the game. Stop telling him they are harder
[3:25:27] <+OGBiggBone17> nope u str at 1
[3:25:28] <Nomad94> 50 is fine
[3:25:37] <@akuda_bar> literally anything would be fine tbh
[3:25:37] <GooseyGanderer> later floors will fuck you up
[3:25:44] <@akuda_bar> it won't fuck him up
[3:25:44] <sunnythedrunk> Do 90-100 on camera
[3:25:45] <%chosenjuan42> you can do troubles today
[3:25:45] <Am_Shigar00> The later parts of the pit are tougher than the final dungeon
[3:25:47] <SiegeJay> @cynical_canadian The Journey to the Pit Boss is hard
[3:25:47] <Nomad94> @DukeBlack_ you CAN, but SHOULD you.
[3:25:49] <dromemer3> 50 to 100 is op!!!
[3:25:50] <pmmori> 80 to 100 are really difficult
[3:25:51] <%ringabal> OH YEAH THAT ONE
[3:25:56] <jettsetter> do the end of the pit on camera
[3:25:58] <@akuda_bar> TTYD is the ultimate "do whatever" game, you can't fuck yourself over

[3:39:18] <%ringabal> Excuse you Woolie, Peach was delivered by a stork
[3:39:19] <%Th3SmartAlec> Are Peach and Mario isekai protagonists?
[3:39:20] <%HeroVersusOfficial> Is peach even a human? Isn't she some weird fungus symbiote?
[3:39:22] <zakor1138> @WoolieVersus And Rosalina is human too
[3:39:22] <%Asuterisuku> Mario is definitely not from our world.
[3:39:25] <+skyheys> no hes not
[3:39:27] <dromemer3> @th3smartalec new high tec bob omb hes testing out lol

[3:39:53] <notsoy> isn't there a badge to insta-kill things from areas you've already beaten?
[3:39:56] <%Jaysky> How old is Rosalina anyway? Bitch be cosmic
[3:39:57] <DukeBlack_> wait so how old was Mario when fought cranky?
[3:39:59] <dinnydanny777> Mario spending all his time eating "mushrooms" would explain a few of the things that happen in the games

[3:49:43] <DukeBlack_> snark1G
[3:49:46] <%CommanderSqueaks> CommanderSqueaks subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! Watching the life drain from Woolie's eyes as he realizes that he has to see talk to Podley again is what I watch this stream for.
[3:49:46] <Cynical_Canadian> If there's one thing I can say that's bad in the old Paper Marios, it's the backtracking
[3:49:46] <%chosenjuan42> use the HD button to save within pit

[3:51:53] <SiegeJay> Gatcha Games!
[3:51:56] <%RioGascar> it was fucking stupid
[3:51:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> Woolie doesn't understand the big Kiaji energy.
[3:51:58] <Cynical_Canadian> Children aren't the smartest
[3:51:59] <+Zenryoku21> 1% is the same as 100%
[3:52:00] <SomersaultJustice> what happened? I wasn't listening
[3:52:01] <An_Armed_Bear> I doubt his dad would have actually done it
[3:52:01] <+skyheys> HE GOT A GAMEBOY
[3:52:11] <SiegeJay> GATCHA GATCHA GAMES!
[3:52:21] <%Chatterbox1991> YOLO WOOLIE
[3:52:23] <%RioGascar> oh no he would have done it
[3:52:27] <@akuda_bar> what, as though his dad would actually have sold his XBOX though
[3:52:28] <%RioGascar> if i lost
[3:52:32] <dizimous> Still a bad call
[3:52:33] <Ecliptic_Origins> Take too big of a risk, too many times, and you are bound to get burned to a fucking crisp
[3:52:33] <+HeroVersusOfficial> Wait what happened I missed it
[3:52:35] <Cynical_Canadian> @RioGascar do you play gatch games, cause your luck might work there
[3:52:38] <%chosenjuan42> He found a purple gameboy on the floor someone must if dropped it
[3:52:43] <@akuda_bar> what kind of sociopath dad would ACTUALLY sell his sons xbox on a bet
[3:52:48] <%RioGascar> also for context
[3:52:48] <+skyheys> "Fuck people who win in risky ways" -Woolie LUL
[3:52:55] <%CommanderSqueaks> @akuda_bar I would totally do it, but I also don't have kids.
[3:52:55] <%RioGascar> i was like 8 years old
[3:53:06] <NotHereToStream> basically don't wake up DP
[3:53:13] <+Rekinsinn> LUL

[3:53:24] <Cynical_Canadian> We've all done dumb stuff as children to be fair
[3:53:29] <dromemer3> but good life lesson!!
[3:53:30] <Ecliptic_Origins> D:
[3:53:30] <%JetpackMcQuack> did I stutter
[3:53:32] <%CommanderSqueaks> @RioGascar You deserved to have your XboX sold
[3:53:53] <@akuda_bar> if i were the dad i'd pretend to sell it and then give it back the next day or something fair
[3:53:53] <Cynical_Canadian> @RioGascar now THAT'S unforgiveable /s
[3:54:07] <+Rekinsinn> oh, it just hit me how worthless a gameboy color is in a time period where you had an XBOX
[3:54:13] <+skyheys> The fathers of capitalism are shaking their heads with disgust
[3:54:30] <%CommanderSqueaks> @akuda_bar Naw, I would have pretended to sell it and then just play it myself.
[3:54:32] <%hamahiroyuki> now it's already done sure. but that was not a smart move
[3:54:41] <hassanico2> Is stream over guys?
[3:54:45] <Cynical_Canadian> Instead, you walk into 4 shoryu's, that's a real smart bet /s
[3:54:48] <hassanico2> Or just breaking?
[3:54:57] <%HeroVersusOfficial> If you gamble your fingers for a million dollars but you win, it doesn't matter how many fingers you gambled, you won.
[3:55:09] <%cdrom321> @hassanico2 Duscussion is still going.
[3:55:15] <%HeroVersusOfficial> What an absolute mad lad
