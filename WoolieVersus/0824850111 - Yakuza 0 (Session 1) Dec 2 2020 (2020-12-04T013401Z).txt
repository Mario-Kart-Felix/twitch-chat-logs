[0:16:46] <+toadlyy> SHOGI MAKES ME DIE
[0:16:47] <agomera666> are you guys going to switch over the controller between parts? Woolie's going to be jealous of Little V's sections!

[0:18:01] <brian_peppers1> Dragon Engine tho
[0:18:03] <%Exiliator> woolieDATTEBAYO
[0:18:03] <passserby> yakuza dead souls best game
[0:18:05] <%gnarly_memes_bro> @atteroproxy I learned poker through tales of the abyss, only to learn that it was crippled baby poker
[0:18:05] <%SilverDevilfish> 0 or LAD are good points to start
[0:18:06] <generalve> Kiwami 2 is kind of better.....
[0:18:07] <+condemned_15> How are we still asking this?
[0:18:08] <+HeroSolaire> Yakuza 1 and 2 on PS2 are really good though
[0:18:08] <+thesyndrome> Kiwami 2 is great, kiwami 1 is ok, but not amazing
[0:18:10] <MyNameIsRasus> 7 is pretty strong
[0:18:10] <dante_9x> 5 هس فاث لاثسف
[0:18:11] <alvaroeltz> fuck it, start on 4
[0:18:13] <Solidnick18> dragon engine Kreygasm
[0:18:13] <+krispen_wa> No V, you gotta start at Yakuza Isshin
[0:18:16] <%ZweihanderSteve> ZweihanderSteve subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! Hey 3rd month with prime!Stayed up till 5AM this morning working on a promotional job pool. It'll be the difference between making 60k and 70k in 2021, so I really appreciate the work you and your friends put in recently. Regardless of fumbles and rants
[0:18:16] <%Garthunox> its not a full reset
[0:18:16] <+kewlmyc> I hear 7 is also contending to be the best one now
[0:18:16] <brachydios777> Speak of the god damn devil, I was just playing Yakuza 0!
[0:18:16] <$MateoPeso> I'm playing Kiwami 2 right now
[0:18:17] <+atteroproxy> Can’t wait for 10 straight episodes of Cabaret Club
[0:18:17] <dante_9x> 5 is the best
[0:18:18] <%CaptainPileDriver> 2 is fucking amazing
[0:18:20] <dante_9x> oops
[0:18:20] <%p4ntless> Yakuza has the reverse persona problem, instead of making it hard to go backwards it's painful to go forward after 0
[0:18:21] <smackdownbeef> It's time for Black Panther
[0:18:22] <%blaccbird914> like a dragon is fighting for that top spot for me
[0:18:24] <OldManDeckardCain> I prefer 2 tbh, but it's a really small difference to me
[0:18:25] <@Menitta> Even with Like a Dragon, 0 is still the best place to start
[0:18:25] <EBT93> I started at 4 LUL
[0:18:26] <$Hotironclad> 0 is the best... until 7 came along
[0:18:27] <+HeroSolaire> Yakuza 1 english dub is the best
[0:18:28] <+Ninjamaninjas> You guys ever notice V is never around when LittleV is ? LUL
[0:18:28] <velgaduere> DOPE
[0:18:29] <%Lion_kun> 7 and 5 are probably better.
[0:18:29] <+Omegaanimus> Eeeeh, Kiwami 2 is pretty great and on the new engine
[0:18:30] <ShershaAD> 0 is absolutely the best place to ssatrt
[0:18:31] <skewerstar> The only shitty part of mahjong in this is that the number tiles are only in japanese. they don't put the little english numbers until...I wanna say 6.
[0:18:31] <%aram909> honestly yakuza 7 is creeping up in its ranking and it may outrank yakuza 0 soon for me
[0:18:33] <ShershaAD> *start
[0:18:35] <chainsaw105> there are a few call...forawrds? to events that happen in future games but yeah its good to start with
[0:18:37] <%DaRyeBeachHood> DaRyeBeachHood subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! Thanks for playing this gem! Hope you have a blast!
[0:18:37] <%Javaa01> Having completed 7, it is genuinely as good if not better then Zero
[0:18:38] <Ultimatefool> 0, 2, 5, and 7 are my favorites. But START with 0 please
[0:18:39] <+thesyndrome> I really prefer the engine used in kiwami 2
[0:18:39] <bobbyratlair> 0=LAD>2>4>1>6>3
[0:18:41] <+HitchhikingThrough> @Ninjamaninjas Yeah, what's up with that?
[0:18:42] <T_Sasquatch> after 0 everything goes downhill to be very honest. Its just that good
[0:18:42] <tacomaster740> are you uncomfortable in those suits
[0:18:49] <+thesickestzak> Fist of the North Star is the best one to start on :)
[0:18:49] <brachydios777> Watched the lp on the old channel, i’m in ch 6 now
[0:18:49] <Karhax> Would you say it's like Fate Zero?
[0:18:52] <@Menitta> Its better than starting with the first PS2 game even because that game is ROUGH
[0:18:53] <%masterpiecejeremy> 4 is the best because Pachinko.
[0:18:55] <+chosenjuan42> Start with FIGHT 🦀 CRAB
[0:18:59] <%DappercatEsquire> got that suit bit money
[0:19:00] <Darren716> LUL

[0:26:45] <turbofolk> of course a 'you' would choose a all white suit
[0:26:45] <dukenux> White suit would really highlight those blood spots nicely

[0:27:00] <+McSoliace> 7 is best ost now
[0:27:00] <tabbymcgee> its soooo gooood
[0:27:01] <$Halospaz117> I say Yakuza 1 OG has best OST
[0:27:01] <bobbyratlair> breaker theme is so good
[0:27:01] <%toastybites> They removed Bubble tho
[0:27:01] <sonofthedeepsouth> IT IS
[0:27:02] <rasamune> Studies have shown that people enjoy stories more if they get spoiled on them a little bit
[0:27:02] <+krispen_wa> KIWAMI 2
[0:27:02] <Joestar1890> Y7 is second place
[0:27:04] <redrins> debatable, 6 and 7 have some good shit

[0:27:09] <DatAsuna> I don't agree but it's a good OST
[0:27:10] <@Menitta> Kinda yeah
[0:27:10] <DotMatrixLeviathan> 3 has best ost
[0:27:10] <%Disembob> The battle themes in 0 are tremendous.

[0:30:57] <+AgadezXX> NEVER BACK DOWN 0
[0:30:57] <T_Sasquatch> except that ONE time Kappa
[0:30:58] <Lieutenant_America> MIXED MEDIA
[0:30:58] <+GingerStrawhat> More like 5
[0:30:59] <+Czar_Kazem> WEIRD CUTSCENES
[0:31:00] <Parapattern> You were talkin that GOOD SHIT
[0:31:01] <thepictotwitch> why is kiryu double cheeked up
[0:31:02] <+Wilabeen1997> Not even once
[0:31:03] <+Deko_> ITS COOL THO
[0:31:03] <+HeroSolaire> The low budget cutscenes!
[0:31:04] <Darren716> This is the money saving cutscene
[0:31:05] <%Malik1002> like KIRU IS LIKE 2 FEET taller then these boys like wtf you going to do
[0:31:05] <%guyalex> like 4-5 haha
[0:31:06] <sonofthedeepsouth> THE STILLS
[0:31:07] <ShmowzowKapow> low budget baby
[0:31:07] <%Josef_Stryker> NEVER
[0:31:07] <Mr_Strut> The storyboard cutscene
[0:31:09] <iosephe> at least 4
[0:31:09] <DatAsuna> 3 forms of budget
[0:31:10] <CappuccinoGuil> Don't all Yakuza games have multiple styles of cutscenes?
[0:31:10] <BioticEmu> BUDGET
[0:31:10] <+thetruewaifu> dont worry about the cars full of people hes about to blow up
[0:31:11] <dukenux> Budget limitations eh
[0:31:11] <Prevot> money ran out
[0:31:12] <CrimsonSilver4> high framerate
[0:31:13] <Solidnick18> yeah they do that to save that cash
[0:31:14] <%toastybites> This was probably a test
[0:31:15] <WG101> MONEY: OFF
[0:31:15] <Winner_92> we bayonetta now
[0:31:17] <%DeathByAttempt> I do like these, it's very stylized for a crime drama
[0:31:17] <%DaRyeBeachHood> Bayonetta!
[0:31:17] <LittleWulfie> 7 has like, these but waaay better done
[0:31:18] <brian_peppers1> ITS FINE
[0:31:18] <+solzan2000> bayonetta CS
[0:31:19] <PanicSwytch> But this is super rare
[0:31:20] <turbofolk> We ran out of money to move the lips
[0:31:20] <brunoberserk> money down
[0:31:22] <+TheotherKristian> The Bayonetta still frames
[0:31:22] <@Menitta> they're kinda neat but its weird
[0:31:23] <dukenux> Saved on animation
[0:31:23] <%CaptainPileDriver> woolie NEVER had he killed anyone
[0:31:23] <%FuqBoiSlim> oh so like bayonetta
[0:31:23] <+bonanzo> the mid budget
[0:31:24] <sm0key123> And it does this only three times
[0:31:24] <+puraestationu> IT'S EXPENSIVE OK
[0:31:24] <%Asuterisuku> Some of those cutscenes are prerendered and it's absolutely bizarre.
[0:31:24] <huskarl_zap> Theres still total still cutscenes
[0:31:24] <+skyheys> BIG FRAMERATE
[0:31:27] <alvaroeltz> Money: Little bit off
[0:31:27] <%BisoromiBear> motion comic style
[0:31:27] <%IzazaOzihaha> 7 definitely does this better
[0:31:29] <%p4ntless> the secret yakuza telekinesis technique
[0:31:29] <$Halospaz117> Oh shit, this is bayo, isn't it?
[0:31:29] <%Livelinne> MONEY DOWN
[0:31:29] <Sternieliscious> Sure hope you like PORES!
[0:31:30] <+MrBaconJam> The Bayonetta Cutscenes LUL
[0:31:30] <%Ancopro> the real low budget ones are the in game model ones
[0:31:30] <+SainEdge> this type of cutscene is only in the first few hours LUL
[0:31:31] <T_Sasquatch> its super rare when this happens
[0:31:32] <rosemon5001> its localiced KING CRIMSON
[0:31:33] <smackdownbeef> High Budget Cutscenes, Low Budget Cutscenes and NO Budget Cutscenes.
[0:31:34] <+condemned_15> The Highest Framerate!
[0:31:36] <jorniev> THE HIGH BUDGET ONES THOUGH
[0:31:39] <+JustToWatch> thank god we can see this at high frame rate
[0:31:39] <+chiazam> TOP EARNER KIRYU-CHAAAN
[0:31:40] <thepictotwitch> i like it it gives like, a visual novel feel almost :)
[0:31:40] <%DeathByAttempt> Cus it isn't just static, they are still animated
[0:31:42] <dukenux> Don't worry, there are LOTS of voiced cutscenes still
[0:31:42] <WhatzePh> The framerate is off the charts!
[0:31:45] <+Wilabeen1997> This isn’t even the low budget ones weirdly enough
[0:31:48] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> I like the cutscene style variety
[0:31:50] <+rheviel> money off?
[0:31:52] <+krispen_wa> It reminds me of PSP game cutscenes
[0:31:53] <Solidnick18> kuroda Kreygasm
[0:32:00] <+condemned_15> This Benchmark is next level
[0:32:02] <sonofthedeepsouth> HE IS RIGHT
[0:32:07] <%Garthunox> Kiryu is 20 btw guys
[0:32:10] <WG101> @krispen_wa well, there was "Black Panther" so...
[0:32:12] <MyNameIsRasus> Actually correct
[0:32:14] <JetpackMcQuack> Wipe your god damn face
[0:32:16] <dukenux> I like how this guy doesn't have a name
[0:32:16] <jotabranded> fucking love this atmosphere
[0:32:17] <turbofolk> Last job
[0:32:18] <Darren716> Kiryu already being the worst Yakuza
[0:32:19] <%Asuterisuku> The people and stage elements are still animated and it looks so weird.
[0:32:21] <WG101> Black Panther as in the Yakuza spin-off
[0:32:24] <dukenux> unless "Loan Shark" is his name
[0:32:24] <CrimsonSilver4> Kiryu's only 5 people.
[0:32:25] <Joestar1890> The start if everyone ragging on Kiryu's style
[0:32:26] <$Halospaz117> It feels weird that there's a Yakuza game where I'm older than Kiryu
[0:32:30] <Pookiedaexzile> Kiryu: The best Worst Yak to ever kuza
[0:32:37] <sonofthedeepsouth> You are correct Loan Shark man
[0:32:44] <NottaAlotta> This seems like a guy you can trust
[0:32:45] <Parapattern> Be sure to advertise that you're a criminal as loudly as possible
[0:32:45] <+chosenjuan42> baby loan shark
[0:32:45] <CappuccinoGuil> YES! Boy!

[0:32:55] <%X2Eliah> Kiryu looks almost emaciated
[0:32:55] <%aram909> EYYY BOYYYYY
[0:32:55] <dukenux> Eh! BOY
[0:32:57] <scrumbotime> I don't like how the mouths SLIGHTLY animate, like they're chewing
[0:32:57] <misterurbanthelegend> Ryu Ga Gotoku Studios are masters of savin' cash.
[0:32:58] <+krispen_wa> THIS GUY IS 20
[0:33:00] <%Livelinne> Oh teh bubble

[0:33:04] <+RowenCleric> I dunno Ichiban is a pretty bad Yakuzie too
[0:33:05] <smackdownbeef> Kiryu says "Idc"

[1:16:29] <smackdownbeef> Woolie, there's a lot of cutscenes
[1:16:31] <thepictotwitch> kiryu: i only punched his face so its honest nomadn1FairCharacter
[1:16:31] <+Bailey__gaming> Empty lots are VERY important
[1:16:32] <Darren716> Say the line
[1:16:32] <Mr_Strut> There are much more important things to animate
[1:16:32] <nailwind> another football match happened
[1:16:33] <+Stupid121v2> THE ABANDON LOT

[1:16:39] <%FuqBoiSlim> Kiryu is a murder virgin. A Murgin if you would
[1:16:39] <OneThousandTomatoes> I actually think this kind of cutscene works for this scene
[1:16:40] <%doomerskeletor13> D:
[1:16:40] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> ACCIDENTALLY KILLED
[1:16:41] <misterurbanthelegend> Guts is 6ft 8 inch post armor.
[1:16:42] <Cynical_Canadian> When people take realistic damage from Kiryu
[1:16:42] <ayexp4254> woolie actually killed that guy
[1:16:42] <+Hankovitch> use fists to commit murder
[1:16:43] <DSD24> Keep talking about this in Public Kiryu
[1:16:43] <+el_hearto> Near the end of the game these types of cutscenes basically disappear
[1:16:45] <%Graxe_> This lot

[1:16:45] <dukenux> The Empty Lot monkaS
[1:16:46] <Darren716> We got lot, not empty though
[1:16:48] <+johnnychopsocky> this is a minor cutscene. A blip.
[1:16:50] <niddron> Kiryuu never killed a man! *begining of the series*
[1:16:51] <%LastHazzerd> the empty lot!
[1:16:51] <flame_of_udun_> This game has a shit ton of cutscenes
[1:16:51] <8bitdana> the most important lot ever
[1:16:52] <smackdownbeef> This LOT sure is EMPTY
[1:16:54] <+EdenOfLove> HOW COULD I POSSIBLY have killed him?
[1:16:54] <BreakersAweigh> the L O T
[1:16:55] <MyNameIsRasus> It truly is an empty lot
[1:16:55] <+HitchhikingThrough> WHAT AN INCONSPICUOUS LOT
[1:16:56] <disflipmat> Hey Kiryu, sometimes people die when they're killed.
[1:16:56] <%SuperKirby24> monkaS
[1:17:00] <$Superdandy96> Looks like Woolie and Kiryu have something in common: they both killed that one guy Kappa
[1:17:00] <%CaptainPileDriver> one of a few plot holes, kiryu, you can literally beat someone to death you dumbass
[1:17:05] <majima666> yeah, its metal gear levels of cutscene for the main plot
[1:17:06] <+jaiykakoo> KIRYU HAS NEVER KILLED ANYONE
[1:17:07] <%rngwrldngnr> I think it's less a budget thing than if the cutscene requires animation of large body movements.
[1:17:08] <Cynical_Canadian> "But I hit him with my rubber fists!"
[1:17:15] <huskarl_zap> He totally didnt die of a hemmorage
[1:17:16] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> THE VACANT PLOT-wait

[1:17:23] <+QueequegTheater> Nishiki shut the fuck up
[1:17:25] <gsoto83> Like these type of cutscenes are gone in a few minutes, its mostly cinematics after this

[1:17:30] <%rngwrldngnr> love the pagers
[1:17:34] <DSD24> Internal Decapitiation
[1:17:34] <%LastHazzerd> internal bleeding doesn't exist in video games
[1:17:39] <%Klefth> Kiryu has NEVER KILLED ANYONE
[1:17:40] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Kiryu doesnt know what internal bleeding in
[1:17:41] <+le_master_of_le_swords> Oh shit little V
[1:17:43] <nailwind> the fists caused ALLERGIC REACITON
[1:17:43] <%SuperKirby24> lolpagers
[1:17:46] <%gnarly_memes_bro> @parapattern The Lot That Never Was
[1:17:46] <%FuqBoiSlim> Didn't Kiryu DAS BOOT him right in the head. That could kill a man
[1:17:47] <%Feralspirit41> Its ok because blood is supposed to be on the inside
[1:17:47] <Ajax__013> Kazuma Kiryu never killed anybody
[1:17:49] <%LastHazzerd> lower quality models
[1:17:50] <fuji_92> KIRYU NEVER KILLED ANYONE
[1:17:53] <clockworkidiot> "I only punched him so hard his head spun 360"
[1:17:54] <BubbaGAN0USH> falls and lands their head on a curb
[1:17:55] <niddron> YUP, your head can be a fucking melon if it falls on the ground
[1:17:56] <Ganfur> I just smashed a motorcyle on his head he can't be dead
[1:17:56] <+Hankovitch> bit him so hard he immediately reincarnated
[1:18:00] <%big_laser_boss> Yeet someone of a rooftop
[1:18:06] <OneThousandTomatoes> yep
[1:18:06] <%cobalt_phoenix_> the worst part of the bad fall is seeing their limbs spasm
[1:18:07] <%doomerskeletor13> Get used to shuffling through cutscene types
[1:18:09] <chainsaw105> dust your fists with peanut butter and punch the allergic neighbors
[1:18:09] <+Huttersson> It is best to treat the Yakuza world as one where it is literally impossible to kill anyone in a fistfight ever.
[1:18:11] <+QueequegTheater> It's a fun little game where if you hit the ground in a specific way, you just never wake back up
[1:18:20] <+TenguGemini> people are scarily fragile at times
[1:18:20] <8bitdana> kiryu shoots down a helicopter but he didnt kill anyone Kappa
[1:18:22] <+VoytekBus> it was the lucky cat!
[1:18:25] <%SuperKirby24> Yakuza does not encourage killing Kappa
[1:18:27] <huskarl_zap> Kiryu "Damn it I need to punch something right now."

[1:18:37] <+johnnychopsocky> Blunt Force Trauma never liked a single person in Yakuza Town
[1:18:41] <+QueequegTheater> Remember, Kiryu has NEVER KILLED A SINGLE PERSON
[1:18:41] <Komayeda> That's why they call 'em Heat moves
[1:18:42] <+Nallex9> Yup Yakuza pretty smart like that
[1:18:43] <jorniev> he HAD A BULLETHOLE MAN
[1:18:47] <+Deko_> pinkies are enough, no need to kill
[1:18:48] <madtrixr> yeah killing civilians never sits well

[1:23:25] <%Asuterisuku> Money is your XP.
[1:23:26] <Cynical_Canadian> And money flies out of them
[1:23:27] <$Halospaz117> @kewlmyc I don't even think it's a mod, I think it's just a value you have to change in the files

[1:24:09] <OfficerMods> LOL
[1:24:09] <MyNameIsRasus> :)
[1:24:09] <+segmentedfool> Please look for the heat prompt woolie
[1:24:10] <+SvenHolgersson> BOY DID THAT NOT AGE WELL
[1:24:12] <+thetruewaifu> keep talking and YOU might lose a finger
[1:24:13] <jamesthebrave> Important to remember: Yakuza is an RPG with quests, random encounters and character building.
[1:24:16] <DeathByPoke7> :)
[1:24:19] <+QueequegTheater> taxi
[1:24:20] <%karldeck> Woolie, that's the kids media being affected

[1:24:34] <+Hankovitch> thin white glove line
[1:24:34] <$Superdandy96> Remember this moment for when we do a compilation
[1:24:36] <ArkSeaside> Kamurocho has the same "Random Fight Disease" as River City
[1:24:38] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Hes overthinking again LUL
[1:24:38] <Pookiedaexzile> :)
[1:24:42] <T_Sasquatch> Hope you bought consumables
[1:24:43] <+Nallex9> YUP
[1:24:44] <%doomerskeletor13> He’ll start using heat moves, that was only like his third fight
[1:24:45] <notsoy> those things make the story of yakuza 7 crazier in that it was actually written in such a way
[1:24:49] <OfficerMods> including cia agents is VERY frowned upon
[1:24:50] <+TenguGemini> as an asexual man myself, kiryu is goals
[1:24:50] <+Tucker0603> always remember your heat moves, and the prompts in the top corner
[1:24:56] <%GeneralSCPatton> I think I recognize that spot from 7 nikkib12Pog
[1:24:56] <huskarl_zap> HOL up, Cancer break.
[1:24:58] <thepictotwitch> @TenguGemini hell YEAH
[1:25:00] <misterurbanthelegend> Because police in japan are never wrong...
[1:25:00] <%Asuterisuku> Really colourful at night.
[1:25:13] <8bitdana> @TenguGemini AsexualPride AsexualPride hell yeah
[1:25:15] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> I also stayed in Shinjuku its great
[1:25:16] <olaksi> 99% conviction rate, it's pretty medieval
[1:25:18] <Solidnick18> not yet
[1:25:27] <Cynical_Canadian> At least this game never does the thing where it tells you to find the real life location without guiding you
[1:25:39] <%Asuterisuku> You can move the camera.
[1:25:40] <DSD24> Get In!
[1:25:45] <+QueequegTheater> @TenguGemini Unfortunately, he does actually shack up with a lady after Yakuza 2
[1:25:46] <%RyuuAoi> Jesus
[1:25:47] <+TenguGemini> also i kind of love that kiryu cant be in a fighting game because he wouldnt hit a woman. That might be the single best reason for not having a character cross over
[1:25:50] <%FuqBoiSlim> go to don Quixote
[1:25:51] <ayexp4254> anyone think the credits songs for the Like a Dragon were weird choices?
[1:25:55] <8bitdana> chat did you know that people will come light up majimas cigarette if your club gets popular enough
[1:25:56] <OfficerMods> devs literally just copied kabukicho
[1:25:59] <@Menitta> you can also just pause to get that
[1:25:59] <+TenguGemini> huh
[1:26:03] <notsoy> if that's an issue, we can just do majima in a fighting game instead
[1:26:04] <+Freeborg1997> This blind?
[1:26:07] <%tank7013> @WoolieVersus I think you can press a button to prompt it
[1:26:07] <%cache_22> Taxi is basically a new map load.
[1:26:09] <%Exiliator> ooh didnt know that
[1:26:09] <PKSomething> @Freeborg1997 ye
[1:26:09] <%MaddyCaddy> You have to own the business I believe
[1:26:10] <fIashman92> Really?
[1:26:11] <$Superdandy96> @tengugemini could the same be applied for Majima?
[1:26:11] <+Nallex9> Its the beeeeest
[1:26:12] <OneThousandTomatoes> that's cool
[1:26:13] <%Asuterisuku> Blind for Woolie, not for V.
[1:26:13] <%Ancopro> really? i never tried
[1:26:14] <MyNameIsRasus> the blindest
[1:26:16] <Darren716> Woolie is blind, V has played it
[1:26:16] <huskarl_zap> To enter the clubs sega, you must first pass the great wall of cancer.
[1:26:16] <notsoy> besides, tekken has pulled more villains than main characters
[1:26:17] <+johnnychopsocky> Time for Woolie to see some IMPORTANT FACES
[1:26:19] <+Koover> @Freeborg1997 blind for woolie
[1:26:20] <%Garthunox> that related to the management game
[1:26:21] <flame_of_udun_> What???
[1:26:22] <DSD24> Look at this building
[1:26:24] <EBT93> Wait, really?!
[1:26:25] <flame_of_udun_> I never did that
[1:26:26] <%doomerskeletor13> Yeah that’s like the last achievement I got
[1:26:26] <chainsaw105> that's only when you progress the real estate minigame I think
[1:26:26] <madtrixr> TOJO KAI
[1:26:26] <%gnarly_memes_bro> @tengugemini that just means we need to get an all dudes fighting game made
[1:26:28] <8bitdana> LETS GO
[1:26:30] <Cynical_Canadian> @Freeborg1997 Woolie is blind and V is guiding his hips

[1:26:35] <bobbyratlair> It’s also just in the pausw menu
[1:26:35] <hassanico2> Didn't Kiryu stop smoking after 5 due to Japanese laws?

[1:28:25] <Cynical_Canadian> Both Awano & Kuza have such strong accents that are instantly recognizable
[1:28:28] <notsoy> a good half of the plot-relevant NPCs in this game are IRL actors
[1:28:31] <DasFreekman> Kuze is an ass but you will learn to respect him
[1:28:32] <Kaneis> I love how imperfect these faces are dude
[1:28:34] <3rdRunner> Awano's a veteran crime drama actor actuall

[1:28:49] <sonofthedeepsouth> OOF

[1:29:10] <+solzan2000> lol
[1:29:12] <Sternieliscious> All of these guys and many sexy ladies in stories/cabaret are real actors with physical representation in-game. That's fairly consistent in the series.

[1:29:15] <+snickers_md> 7 to 8 years?! Damn Ichiban got fucked
[1:29:16] <$Halospaz117> @Thunderhog His VA is just constantly getting into fights with Takaya Kuroda?
[1:29:18] <thepictotwitch> pison? in MY crime life sim?
[1:29:19] <Darren716> You can get just 7 years for murder in Japan?
[1:29:21] <+Squiidd_pope> Fun fact, Awano's actor is TYPECAST in Yakzua films
[1:29:22] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:29:23] <Cynical_Canadian> Kiryu surprised that murder leads to prison
[1:29:24] <+coldsama> @thunderhog what are you talking about his insta account his all cats and food
[1:29:26] <OfficerMods> kiryu would never willingly go to prison

[1:54:05] <niddron> apparently they're a thing
[1:54:07] <Blackleafx> @Cynical_Canadian woolie doesnt know what a millenium tower even is tbh
[1:54:13] <%Asuterisuku> Get all those CP.
[1:54:13] <+QueequegTheater> GIVE CP TO THE CLOWN MAN
[1:54:16] <CappuccinoGuil> @flame_of_udun_ I mean in terms of UX, this map is terrible. LAD has icons, the colors are easier to read, etc.
[1:54:20] <%AngryAsian5> Gotta get that Sea Pea
[1:54:21] <@Menitta> HIRED GOONS
[1:54:22] <%doomerskeletor13> Yeah you can get some good stuff from this

[1:54:27] <%FuqBoiSlim> KIRYU LOVES COLLECTING CP
[1:54:28] <thepictotwitch> kiryu respects women: the encountere
[1:54:31] <Cynical_Canadian> @Blackleafx true, although he might've heard of it since Pat's been talking about the series forever
[1:54:33] <HedgehogGames1> You NEED to give Bob his CP
[1:54:34] <Pookiedaexzile> He won't be switching back
[1:54:36] <IncredibleMeh> aren't big cones just there to be bigger and more difficult to drive through?
[1:54:37] <fuji_92> METER
[1:54:38] <+BaronBattle> HEAT MOVES CMON
[1:54:42] <Solidnick18> remember to use heat woolie
[1:54:44] <+Tucker0603> REMEMBER THE HEAT ACTIONS
[1:54:44] <PerfidiousSinn> Rush is BUSTED for boss fights
[1:54:46] <+HitchhikingThrough> Welcome to the Rush only LP
[1:54:48] <%JaseAdrift> RUSH IS THE BEST
[1:54:49] <Atomic_Blowfish> You're wearing a suit, random yakuza! I don't like suits! I'll KILL you!
[1:54:49] <%doomerskeletor13> FEEL THE HEAT
[1:54:51] <%Asuterisuku> Hey Woolie.
[1:54:54] <%Asuterisuku> Taunt is RT.
[1:54:54] <@Menitta> I love the starting combo in Rush so much. I think it even feels better than the final combo
[1:54:55] <fIashman92> Beast is best, always
[1:54:55] <8bitdana> chat will woolie love majimas dancer style
[1:54:57] <SeedTabulous> You can also use Completion Points to unlock an armor piece that lets you change styles in the middle of any attack animation.
[1:54:57] <SjoeB89> I just noticed you guys are wearing suits. LOL
[1:55:00] <%BisoromiBear> Rush just feels good
[1:55:00] <Blackleafx> h e a t m o v e s
[1:55:01] <@Menitta> Its so snappu
[1:55:02] <BubbaGAN0USH> Really? I never really liked rush. Beast however...
[1:55:02] <KnivesEve> which version is this?
[1:55:02] <ayexp4254> BUY HEALING ITEMS BEFORE MSSION
[1:55:03] <@Menitta> snappy*
[1:55:04] <+skyheys> We're never seeing Brawler again
[1:55:09] <+BaronBattle> think of it like FighterZ, use ur meter u get tons of it
[1:55:09] <%Asuterisuku> @KnivesEve PC.
[1:55:11] <+FlyingRamen> BEAST
[1:55:14] <+Nallex9> oh man dancer style....
[1:55:14] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> @WoolieVersus Small correction: the red thing is anger, not heat (bosses have heat though)
[1:55:14] <kaminarihime3> Super hyped that Woolie is playing one of my fav games of all time, hope u like it!
[1:55:16] <damienlunas> Purple is Bitch Out
[1:55:17] <+QueequegTheater> maybe buy some stamamaminanan
[1:55:18] <brian_peppers1> HEAT MOVES remember those?
[1:55:18] <SunnyRmuffins> @bubbagan0ush, same
[1:55:21] <%Th3SmartAlec> Brawlers a low tier style anyway
[1:55:21] <%doomerskeletor13> Purple is fear state yeah
[1:55:21] <%tank7013> @WoolieVersus There's a special heat move when you stun an enemy but it's super easy to knock enemies out of stun
[1:55:22] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> R2
[1:55:23] <ardbart> The cone is normal sized. Kiryu is just short
[1:55:24] <Wind_Burst> beast gang is best gang
[1:55:24] <Cynical_Canadian> I think Beast became my fav later on when you can just annialate mobs with it
[1:55:28] <+thetruewaifu> someone tell him to use the sprint button
[1:55:30] <Mr_Strut> Rush quickly became my least favorite once I learned how to beast
[1:55:32] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Also you can heat moved people who are downed
[1:55:32] <+Nallex9> YUP
[1:55:33] <$Superdandy96> Also, the more meter you have with Rush, the faster you can react
[1:55:34] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Chat loves to backseat today
[1:55:39] <Hoot_Patoots> oh man i forgot that old system
[1:55:40] <+skyheys> NO STACKING
[1:55:40] <+BaronBattle> i mean he only got two pockets
[1:55:40] <+HitchhikingThrough> for NO REASON
[1:55:41] <%Th3SmartAlec> OH GOD I FORGOT LUL
[1:55:41] <%Asuterisuku> 20 items and that's it.
[1:55:41] <%SuperKirby24> @wind_burst beast gang rise up
[1:55:43] <flame_of_udun_> Chat just let him play lol
[1:55:43] <+QueequegTheater> Now buy 19 staminan Royales
[1:55:48] <flame_of_udun_> He’ll figure it out
[1:55:53] <+thetruewaifu> best part of the game becuase otherwise you could have infinite heals
[1:55:53] <bobbyratlair> and this is why no one uses armor or weapons :)
[1:55:58] <kingra> Let him play <3
[1:55:59] <%Chatterbox1991> Staminan Royal's are your best friend
[1:55:59] <flame_of_udun_> Only 20 spots Kappa
[1:56:01] <@Menitta> The best part about 0 though is that you can just buy 20 of the best healing items for basically free
[1:56:01] <smackdownbeef> Literally a carry over from Yakuza 3
[1:56:02] <+R0bobot> You can heat move anytime the symbol shows up on the top right corner.
[1:56:03] <%JaseAdrift> V is here to guide him chat
[1:56:04] <Cynical_Canadian> I'm glad they let items stack in later games
[1:56:05] <chainsaw105> this doesn't doesn't seem like a problem now, and it never actually becomes a problem
[1:56:06] <majima666> yakuza is the true survival horror
[1:56:06] <thetrashman_sc> its fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiine
[1:56:07] <+Nallex9> Remember guys V is here as a guide NOT US
[1:56:08] <+Tucker0603> you keep missing the prompts
[1:56:09] <+skyheys> @queequegtheater Do you want him to finish the game in 3 minutes?
[1:56:10] <%FuqBoiSlim> woolie will figure it out guys
[1:56:11] <%Asuterisuku> @bobbyratlair Equipment is a seperate category, thankfully.
[1:56:13] <Solidnick18> if you see the prompt
[1:56:19] <%Javaa01> Heat Moves are listed in the menu
[1:56:19] <%Lion_kun> They fix this in later games.
[1:56:21] <fIashman92> Heat moves with Rush are hard to do. Why I didn't like it as much
[1:56:21] <%FuqBoiSlim> :)
[1:56:22] <Hoot_Patoots> manual saaaves
[1:56:22] <cheaddos> it rarely becomes a problem. this is not RE1 inventory lol
[1:56:27] <$Halospaz117> You do have a movelist if you want to check
[1:56:27] <+QueequegTheater> @skyheys You vastly underestimate how much healing he will need
[1:56:28] <jorniev> KEEP AT LEAST ONE TISSUE
[1:56:29] <+mundanelotus> rotate those saves
[1:56:29] <%doomerskeletor13> I don’t think Rush has as many heat moves currently
[1:56:31] <%Ancopro> you have a move list that'll give you conditions for heat moves as well
[1:56:33] <huskarl_zap> I think the gatcha machines give out guns
[1:56:34] <%Asuterisuku> Yes, save rotation is a thing.
[1:56:35] <Hoot_Patoots> seeing yakuza 0 again makes me nostalgic
[1:56:38] <Cynical_Canadian> I'm sure he'll learn the heat moves over time, it's only been a couple fights
[1:56:41] <OneThousandTomatoes> in case the vod messes up
[1:56:44] <bobbyratlair> @Asuterisuku oh shoot really? I dont think its like that in yakuza 3-5
[1:56:44] <+krispen_wa> THE BAT ROOM
[1:56:46] <Blackleafx> Entetain us V :)
[1:56:46] <Hoot_Patoots> hey V, have you played 7 yet ?

[2:22:15] <BubbaGAN0USH> its pretty good
[2:22:15] <LittleWulfie> 0 and 7 are bagers
[2:22:15] <%ottermusprime21> Don't we all love this?

[2:22:20] <CelestialCage> 0 was my favorite before 7 happened
[2:22:21] <somedude1013> 0 has the best soundtrack hands down
[2:22:21] <Treyu000> firefly is the best
[2:22:21] <Ecliptic_Origins> 0's stuff is banger central
[2:22:21] <KnivesEve> hi V, hows the suit going for you?

[2:22:24] <Sgt_Wigglytuff> customer creed is a banger
[2:22:24] <+Awkward_Cyborg> the sountrack is absolutely flawless
[2:22:24] <+skyheys> 2 PS2 was better
[2:22:25] <KnightAsteran> &s is stellar

[2:22:27] <+rsg220> This game's tracks always remind me of Tekken arcade
[2:22:28] <+mars_driver> I prefer the Big Bad from 2 the most, but as a whole package, Zero's top tier.
[2:22:28] <Solidnick18> 7 Kreygasm
[2:22:29] <Haarute> "REIGN" is absolutely my favorite track
[2:22:29] <Komayeda> 5 is pretty good

[2:22:32] <mothmal> y0 entire soundtrack is the best
[2:22:32] <valriot> This is the FZero GX composer
[2:22:33] <+JediOfficial> I miss the styles having their own OST
[2:22:34] <%ShinobiPhoenix> 7 is the new hotness
[2:22:34] <+Awkward_Cyborg> Kuze theme is a total banger
[2:22:37] <Blank9> 1 and 2 are the weakest games in the series musically
[2:22:38] <+captainpodock> I always forget this crew is Canadian and then they break out things like Zed, lol
[2:22:38] <TheToanon> Wait until you get to 3's final boss and 4's OST

[2:22:40] <smackdownbeef> 7 and 4
[2:22:41] <+The_Lunar_Paladin> Judgement is the best
[2:22:41] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Kuze's one is the only one that really sticks in my mind
[2:22:44] <MadFoxOfGamez> Yakuza 6 ost pretty good
[2:22:45] <$NitronStreams> BUSTER WOLF

[2:36:49] <@akuda_bar> @Aldesso how it works is the recipient gets the contact number and a series of numbers sent by that person, but no text, so people learned to make codes like 80085 at each other in order to spell messages

[2:54:56] <ThatGuyThere03> I mean
[2:54:56] <matheuspomp> because crime
[2:54:58] <bobbyratlair> god the acting in this game is so good
[2:54:59] <WG101> he can tank it
[2:55:02] <President_valentine> he can take it
[2:55:02] <$BallerSwagBro9k> HE CAN TAKE IT
[2:55:02] <ThatGuyThere03> and it's all 200 grit
[2:55:03] <+captain_history> PURE CRIME
[2:55:03] <Mr_Strut> Because he's still a punk in this game
[2:55:05] <Archmortal> is this canonically the only time Kiryu ever gets knocked on his ass from being hit?
[2:55:07] <%psidefx> It hides the coke
[2:55:08] <+skyheys> BIG HERO
[2:55:09] <%Asuterisuku> @SeruraRenge K1 disappointed me by going into a Go parlor in a substory and not letting us play the game.
[2:55:09] <derap41> Lot of Fingerprints going away
[2:55:09] <ThatGuyThere03> what are they even doing with it?

[2:55:15] <%doomerskeletor13> Well they are his superiors
[2:55:16] <+zyberion626> money laundering
[2:55:17] <niddron> @ebt93 you know what it means? I mean Yakuza is like a big no no so I'm curious what Yakuza call themselves
[2:55:19] <madtrixr> yeah i dont know why its there other than its part of The Front
[2:55:19] <nicversus> it's for sanding all of the dents out of desk-kun
[2:55:20] <Blackleafx> @Archmortal oh no kiryu eats shit
[2:55:21] <%Disembob> You can tell this is Kiryu's origin story, because he's selling punches. He's not gained the power of no selling.
[2:55:22] <deadpak_> This is about kiryus come up
[2:55:22] <rReizs> its for emergency toilet paper
[2:55:24] <%Asuterisuku> I fucking love Go.
[2:55:24] <Blackleafx> he gets punched down all the time
[2:55:25] <BubbaGAN0USH> LUL
[2:55:26] <%KineKithZen> They get rid of the bodies by sanding them down
[2:55:28] <misterurbanthelegend> Shit needs... Cleaned.
[2:55:30] <CrypticMochi> The real question is how much sandpaper do they go through?
[2:55:31] <%Exiliator> Yes mr. officer. We made a 5000% profit selling sandpaper
[2:55:33] <ThatGuyThere03> AND IT'S STILL FUCKED
[2:55:33] <$BallerSwagBro9k> And that's the end of Kiryus story with the Yakuza

[3:11:42] <flame_of_udun_> @menitta yup good point
[3:11:43] <Prevot> this one is built for you to get all the cheaper stuff first
[3:11:44] <+twohitgood> get knocked down and then get up again
[3:11:44] <Cynical_Canadian> In this game, I usually go for the cheaper first
[3:11:45] <%Asuterisuku> This is the Rush tree.
[3:11:45] <KingVantq> I missed most of the stream NotLikeThis
[3:11:46] <+Tucker0603> this is rush
[3:11:49] <NewVegasResident> No that's rush
[3:11:53] <tanarath> Moves, but sometimes pick up cheap stuff
[3:11:56] <$NitronStreams> Kiryu never killed anyone... but you be surprised what you can live through
[3:11:58] <+BaronBattle> nah if you tombstone someone on concrete they're DEAD i don't care if its Kiryu, Batman or Spider-Man lol
[3:11:58] <+mechslayer71> @tumztwitch he’s leaving the room, that encounter is done
[3:11:58] <KidKaiser23> @kingvantq Same, it hurts
[3:11:59] <%TUMZtwitch> THIS GAME IS SO GOOD

[3:12:02] <@Menitta> TIGER KNEE
[3:12:04] <SilverFaustX> like a dragon is on sale
[3:12:08] <%Asuterisuku> Mighty Knee isn't great.
[3:12:13] <+mgskomododragon> All Dark Blue orbs are new Heat Moves
[3:12:15] <+BaronBattle> dead or drinking meat through a straw
[3:12:18] <deadpak_> When saving up high amounts buying the cheap ones is trivial and worth getting
[3:12:20] <%TUMZtwitch> @mechslayer71 At a later point int the game :)
[3:12:20] <%Disembob> Some of the later heat actions in 0 are just brutal. Like, one's practically a jumping tombstone on, usually, concrete.
[3:12:23] <Mr_Strut> Health is good too, since it's shared between styles
[3:12:23] <misterurbanthelegend> Box of Nails
[3:12:27] <penitentpendant> It's been a while, I believe Health Upgrades are shared between all styles?

[3:16:55] <+Mahbonk> Another simple rule of the Yakuza games : Don't fight Kiryu in a room full of furnitures LUL
[3:16:55] <derap41> Why open doors when you can punch people trough them

[3:31:47] <+MidnightBurst12> gotta go through the joint
[3:31:47] <%rngwrldngnr> my understanding is it's basically unheard of for high level Yakuza to do that, and it's more a bullying tactic to keep low level thugs in line, but even given that it seems plausible for Kuze to do it.
