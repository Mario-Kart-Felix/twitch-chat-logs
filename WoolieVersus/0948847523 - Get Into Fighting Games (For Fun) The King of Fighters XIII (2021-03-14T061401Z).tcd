[0:00:03] <+Shikuru> every fighter has a few weirdos
[0:00:05] <%gatorafan> I remember on the forums I used to go to people used to slam the game because it was "true HD" like Blazblue
[0:00:05] <%ChoculaUltra> Andy looks kinda weird in 13 ngl

[0:01:27] <this_guy_115> KoF fact #916, while being one of the more memorable KoF games due to its gameplay mechanics and artstyle, it was made under heavy time constraints and ultimately failed financially, causing SNK to fall down into the Pachinko mines for years until they got enough money to kickstart their IP's back up, starting with KoF 14
[0:01:29] <+Dova573> Kof is always for GLORIA
[0:01:31] <+thedream_c> good ol XIII trials to scare off new players
[0:01:32] <RyanGelatin> hell yeaaaaaaaa
[0:01:42] <%FreeFuzeIcedTea> we hittin chill buttons today hell yeah
[0:01:44] <+Dova573> Woolie vs La bodega
[0:01:46] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Andy's great looking, but Joe is skinny boy
[0:01:51] <BlackermanZX> reggie gonna have fun with those galactica phantom woolieMIRIN
[0:01:51] <+thedream_c> 2.8 million for beautiful sprites
[0:02:03] <+MrAtheGreat> KoF 13 not evil yet
[0:02:04] <djazo> rollback kof 13 the dream game
[0:02:05] <%CaptainPileDriver> hbjohn hates a good game and everything about it
[0:02:10] <%trustycoyote> Honestly more eyes on KoF13 makes me happy
[0:02:20] <Ardisan_> kof13 Joe looks cool
[0:02:25] <%ChoculaUltra> its too pretty to not look at
[0:02:29] <%FreeFuzeIcedTea> kof13 had some of the most raw evo moments
[0:02:30] <+thedream_c> i don't mind more eyes in KOF13, but people really gotta be careful when they send the mssage about the game
[0:02:34] <+Shikuru> oh yeah, where is Buttons?
[0:02:37] <%krispen_wa> FIGHTING GAMES
[0:02:46] <%CaptainPileDriver> buttons hates kof13
[0:02:49] <@Menitta> KOFXIII is good but I have issues with the designs
[0:02:51] <%trustycoyote> @thedream_c I hear ya
[0:02:53] <+thedream_c> because everyone doing trial videos of KOF13 and claiming its mega super difficult def sends a different message tot he new generation
[0:03:06] <+thedream_c> i mean new generation of FG players who have a different mindset
[0:03:15] <@Menitta> The sprite work is top tier
[0:03:21] <+thedream_c> Kim's pants def wave the best in KOF13
[0:03:28] <+thedream_c> LMAOOO KOF12 aka EX coat hager
[0:03:31] <+thedream_c> hanger*
[0:03:35] <Vashido22> kof 11 is so much fun
[0:03:36] <%ggbhtg> KOF 13 Sprites were LITERALLY too good
[0:03:38] <+thedream_c> KOF11 is on some fun jam
[0:03:38] <this_guy_115> The designs are definitely considered hit or miss in the community, some charaxters look good with it but a lot of them *don't*
[0:03:43] <+thedream_c> AND KOF11 has DUCK KING playable
[0:03:45] <%Akizea> I mean the trials being hard is bad though ya know?
[0:03:49] <@Menitta> KOFXI is my favorite. I like the tag
[0:03:54] <+thedream_c> u can't deny the DUCK KING
[0:03:54] <%ggbhtg> I only owned KOF 99, sooooo
[0:03:59] <%ggbhtg> Strikers tho
[0:04:01] <Ardisan_> best looking 2d game of all yime
[0:04:02] <+thedream_c> oh yeah plus kOF11 tag system
[0:04:05] <BlackermanZX> I love the XI OST
[0:04:13] <Vashido22> XI is legit such a fun game
[0:04:16] <Ardisan_> I dont like tag all that much
[0:04:16] <+Dova573> yo fuck kof12
[0:04:22] <+thedream_c> like the sprite work in 13 is magnificent but best looking is kinda a blind shot there
[0:04:23] <@Menitta> Also I like KOFXI's UI sounds.
[0:04:28] <Vashido22> XI ost has some BANGERS
[0:04:28] <+Dova573> that game burned younger me
[0:04:31] <+Mordexai0> Wait are we playing KoF 11? I just came in
[0:04:38] <+thedream_c> they playing 13
[0:04:38] <%Akizea> isnt* not is lol
[0:04:41] <%gatorafan> XI is a beast I I never danced with, but it looks super rad daedra1DerpyTibs
[0:04:41] <Vashido22> we all agree that fighting game soundtracks peaked at KOF 96 right?
[0:04:43] <Vashido22> right
[0:04:44] <%Nested_Dreams> I'll need to have the feel of KOF's game explained to me, I only understand Tekken and Guilty Gear's games
[0:04:44] <+thedream_c> just hopefully not ALL trial combo mode
[0:04:47] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Ryo and Ralf look like Evil Ryo and Evil Ralf
[0:04:48] <@Menitta> god I would be so happy if there was a KOFXI GIFG
[0:04:49] <%trustycoyote> @Menitta Haven't touched XI but got my hands on a copy a few weeks ago. You recommend, yeah?
[0:04:59] <@Menitta> Absolutely
[0:05:01] <+thedream_c> @Nested_Dreams watch DandyJ's video
[0:05:04] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Vashido22
[0:05:05] <+Mordexai0> Ah man, I wanna see some XI!
[0:05:08] <deafmelone> I got with 99, Neo Blood, and Maximum Impact 2 lol
[0:05:10] <smiggyballs13> Reggie’s eyes are the eyes of a man who’s recently completed a Hero’s Journey.
[0:05:10] <@Menitta> XI is fun as hell
[0:05:11] <+thedream_c> dandyJ was my KOF in a nutshell teacher
[0:05:12] <BlackermanZX> friggin New Order and KD-0075 are my favorite themes
[0:05:13] <%gatorafan> I did play 2003 and that was ROUGH
[0:05:14] <+Dova573> fuck fireless Iori
[0:05:23] <%ggbhtg> I only owned KOF 99, and for some reason, the only other game I played was Max Impact 2... I blame emulators
[0:05:23] <Vashido22> 03 is OOF
[0:05:29] <joshua_42> Old man Gambit
[0:05:38] <+thedream_c> sprites are mad expensive however and could not be captilized easily
[0:05:44] <DatAsuna> rotoscoping basically?
[0:05:50] <+GalacticaPhanto> All of LatAm activated Woolie Watch, me included. Latinx people fucking love KoF and this makes me hyped
[0:05:51] <kevamadi> KoF12 was BARELY a functional fighting game...
[0:05:52] <gunsrlove> MOERO
[0:05:52] <+thedream_c> so 2.8 million on sprites is a super sunk cost for absurd optimization of that art style
[0:05:53] <yuribo26> Mai's sprite is awful
[0:05:54] <@Menitta> it IS HUGE
[0:05:55] <Vashido22> Leona not having a mouth is rought tho lmao
[0:05:56] <this_guy_115> 2003 gave us Ash and Adelheid
[0:06:02] <+thedream_c> KOF12 is pretty much nonexistent
[0:06:02] <%trustycoyote> Terry is a fucking BEEFY man
[0:06:02] <+RowenCleric> yea Mai's forehead...
[0:06:04] <+HawkGoggles2> Oh no the game has a style.
[0:06:06] <+Shikuru> so I never really played any of the KOF games besides XIII. Is execution usually that tight?
[0:06:08] <%itsmostlynick> itsmostlynick subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months!
[0:06:12] <AstrodropGaming> Ralf and Clark spent way too much time on at the tanning salon
[0:06:13] <+Mordexai0> I recently played XI and keep coming back to it. Wish they were playing it.
[0:06:13] <@Menitta> In motion, its gorgeous. That makes the difference
[0:06:14] <Charlie_Xmas> !! was my fav because of the roster
[0:06:15] <Ardisan_> Mai in 13 is the only Mai I like
[0:06:19] <%ggbhtg> "Look at this one dank picture, THEREFORE THE ENTIRE SERIES IS INVALID" - Twitter, 20XX
[0:06:22] <odd_slater> I love it
[0:06:23] <TheactualDiepod> They're just inconsistent, that's what bothers me
[0:06:24] <+thedream_c> @Shikuru sorta not really. It depends on the game
[0:06:28] <Vashido22> @Shikuru 2002UM has harder execution than 13, but other than that, not really
[0:06:29] <gunsrlove> 13 Leona is the best Leona
[0:06:33] <gunsrlove> The BEST
[0:06:34] <+thedream_c> There are motion shortcut tricks
[0:06:35] <DDDorsett> The older ones is tight in terms of execution
[0:06:35] <+TehMiner> There is no game that has NO BAD sprites
[0:06:36] <odd_slater> ^^^^
[0:06:37] <Vashido22> and you dont even need tight execution for 13
[0:06:37] <yuribo26> 13 Leona is fucking fire
[0:06:44] <+thedream_c> if anything the hardest thing in KOF IMO are confirms
[0:06:44] <Ardisan_> @gunsrlove fax
[0:06:45] <Vashido22> you dont need to do super hard stuff in matches
[0:07:02] <Adwark> @ggbhtg Oh please, game isn't perfect in literally every single frame? To trash it goes Kappa
[0:07:02] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:07:03] <+thedream_c> also people got scared of pretzel motion. Only VERY few chars have that in KOF games. Geese being one of them
[0:07:07] <%gatorafan> Leona Kreygasm
[0:07:12] <yuribo26> Good thing those sprites got a lot of mileage Kappa
[0:07:16] <fruit_pie_the_magician> 13 Leona's final trials are hilariously awesome
[0:07:18] <leith_aziz> @ggbhtg: This might come out of nowhere, but I see a name that resembles yours in Xrd lobbies. Is that you ?
[0:07:22] <+thedream_c> if anything If found anoying was oswald because he's totally HCF and QCF/QCB and it flows
[0:07:25] <Adnor_> Because of the new sprites a lot of characters also lost a TON of moves, including some proximity normals
[0:07:29] <odd_slater> 13 Leona is the best grenade belt + midriff = stylish Kreygasm
[0:07:41] <+Dova573> The acarde mode for kof 12 suck asss
[0:07:45] <kevamadi> I actually think the guys look great in 13, but the women all looked better in Capcom vs SNK...
[0:07:47] <Vashido22> yeah, 13 sprites meant a lot of characters lost moves
[0:07:47] <%ggbhtg> @leith_aziz I ain't none never done did toucha the Reva 2. Nope.
[0:07:48] <+Dova573> It was soooo asss
[0:07:48] <theredfox930000> reggie thinking about the frame data lijoeSagat lijoeSagat lijoeSagat
[0:07:51] <BlackermanZX> we dont talk about 12
[0:07:51] <Vashido22> wich is a shame
[0:07:51] <+thedream_c> KOF12 is a glorified coat hanger in arcades
[0:07:57] <%trustycoyote> @Adwark Eyyyy I recognize you. What's good, dood doodGood
[0:07:57] <Ardisan_> 13 Leona makes my dreams become wet
[0:08:02] <%Akizea> my heart will always remain for shermie
[0:08:03] <%gatorafan> @adnor_ I find it weird how King never recovered from that.
[0:08:04] <leith_aziz> Every move has to be animated, so you cant make as many moves as you can
[0:08:04] <+Dova573> but dumb kid me still beat it with all the characters
[0:08:10] <+thedream_c> lmaoo frame data. its easy to kinda blow that concept up with KOF as spacing is such a wild variable
[0:08:12] <BlackermanZX> 13 is so damn fun
[0:08:23] <%ggbhtg> somebody called KOF12 an EX coat hanger? LUL
[0:08:25] <The_500lb_Child> Everyone is talking about Leona, but how about the THICC bois Ralf and Clark?
[0:08:31] <ponteronten> 13 was good though. Shame about the whole "KOF14 trials rage-moments with your favorite fgc player"
[0:08:34] <+thedream_c> @ggbhtg ask the NYC scene
[0:08:40] <Ardisan_> @the_500lb_child MUSCLE UNITS
[0:08:42] <Adwark> @trustycoyote eyyy doodHey doodBro
[0:08:51] <leith_aziz> Ralf/clark are UNBELIVEABLEY Buff
[0:08:51] <+thedream_c> lmao KOF14 trials.
[0:08:52] <DDDorsett> Here we go
[0:08:58] <DDDorsett> The Trials
[0:08:59] <%trustycoyote> @The_500lb_Child Thick with personality too :)
[0:09:00] <+thedream_c> that said KOF14 trials were shorter and fun
[0:09:00] <leith_aziz> Woolie joining the trend ?
[0:09:07] <leith_aziz> my, my
[0:09:08] <+thedream_c> its not about the trials BUTthe content regarding it and the perception
[0:09:08] <%ggbhtg> "KOF Trials are ACTIVELY murdering the KOF COMMUNITYYY"
[0:09:11] <theredfox930000> guilty gear rev 2 had some hard trials
[0:09:13] <+thedream_c> IMO the perception is IMPORTANT
[0:09:15] <Adnor_> @gatorafan Kim also lost his rekkas and now has a super basic moveset, Ryo also lost some moves
[0:09:20] <+thedream_c> because of the new generation and FG noobs/casuals
[0:09:21] <Polar_Bair_8> I hear the trials in 13 are pretty much impractical lmao
[0:09:21] <this_guy_115> 13 is the only game where I dislike the character roster, because none of my main character had made it in
[0:09:26] <ponteronten> They are very specific. Not really worth doing in an actual match
[0:09:27] <Man_in_the_Red> The Combo Trial game doodmaxhype
[0:09:27] <leith_aziz> I play Xrd Rev 2. They have some hard trials
[0:09:34] <+Mordexai0> KoF 2k2 UM is ALOT harder. Also FEXL had a glitched one that was almost impossible.
[0:09:38] <+thedream_c> blame Sajam for that
[0:09:41] <+thedream_c> I mean Brian_F
[0:09:47] <+thedream_c> I mean Junior
[0:09:58] <%Nested_Dreams> @thedream_c Thanks, dandyJ's video is explaining stuff well
[0:09:58] <leith_aziz> They aint too frustratinmg, but Sol's and Baiken's last trial is SO hard
[0:10:02] <+thedream_c> and especially blame Panda Global's team
[0:10:04] <Ardisan_> People dont need to use all this shit.
[0:10:09] <Man_in_the_Red> who cares about combo trials anyways, other than the day 1 block strings in Uniclr theyre arent useful
[0:10:10] <%LastHazzerd> Um.... tough?
[0:10:11] <%ggbhtg> "Trials bad, therefore game bad" Since when?????????
[0:10:12] <Vashido22> I see the point there, but not really
[0:10:20] <Zerotoad5> The trials are not bnbs
[0:10:20] <+yukichocomilk> trials are KILLING the fgc Jebaited
[0:10:24] <%ggbhtg> Hello, SF4
[0:10:26] <@Menitta> this is the universe of "git gud"
[0:10:26] <+thedream_c> @Ardisan_ its not about that. But the perception that it creates that people THINK u need that. And the misinformation that can come out of it.
[0:10:28] <BlackermanZX> so the thing called "trial" is hard af. who knew StinkyGlitch
[0:10:30] <%trustycoyote> @theredfox930000 I agree and Rev2 also have what I feel is the best beginner intro I've seen in a FG
[0:10:37] <Vashido22> I do agree that the trials can give the wrong idea of the game's execution
[0:10:37] <DatAsuna> There will always be players desperate to be handed a "meta" combo
[0:10:42] <Vashido22> but lik
[0:10:46] <AfternoonConcession> here's how not even optimally style on someone
[0:10:46] <Vashido22> not THAT much
[0:10:48] <%LastHazzerd> like understandable, but like, if that's enough to turn folk away, then they weren't gonna get in anyway??
[0:10:50] <%jinking79> sounds like weakness
[0:10:50] <%ggbhtg> Hello SF4 Trials, how yall doin'
[0:10:50] <leith_aziz> I think the trials are important, but its because people want an idea how to play, and I dont think trials do that job
[0:10:53] <+thedream_c> because the people that spread the misinformation are usually the vocal FG noobies/casuals who just eat the content up anyway
[0:11:02] <Polar_Bair_8> ^
[0:11:10] <Polar_Bair_8> I just wanna see people talk about games beyond the combos lol
[0:11:11] <+thedream_c> that is the point of view to take
[0:11:13] <ponteronten> Trials in Rev2 are close to some bnb combos. Eventually, you use them in a match since they feel right to use
[0:11:19] <Polar_Bair_8> I think peole took it personally
[0:11:20] <BlackermanZX> yeah there a lot of these that aren't really that useful LUL
[0:11:23] <@Solidus_113> nah
[0:11:25] <%Jiggisnipe> no they can be challenges too
[0:11:25] <DatAsuna> I would say nah
[0:11:28] <Polar_Bair_8> because it was like "oh so you're shit talking my content?"
[0:11:30] <+thedream_c> I agree trials don't have to be optimal at all. In some cases Xrd has practical stuff in trials
[0:11:33] <arvideogames> @polar_bair_8 A lot of FG players seem obsessed with combos. It’s weird
[0:11:33] <realhumanpizza> they could do both
[0:11:33] <DatAsuna> Trial doesn't equal tutorial per say
[0:11:34] <Vashido22> why not have both? BnB section, and then challenges
[0:11:37] <%trustycoyote> @thedream_c Once again BIG agree with you. The trails are just fun puzzles presented by the devs imo
[0:11:37] <+Mordexai0> That ChefRaptor tweet made a tweet, but the point of the tweet was wanting a 97 with rollback but it was taken the wrong way which brought the discussion.
[0:11:40] <Ardisan_> all I want to know is BnBs
[0:11:42] <leith_aziz> @ponteronten: Some combos like Chipp's are
[0:11:43] <+thedream_c> BUT its about tryign to control the narrative in a social media verse now
[0:11:47] <AfternoonConcession> the trials should be fun but when you're doing the tutorial you should actually be learning while having fun as well
[0:11:48] <Man_in_the_Red> have 2 lists of combo trials, 1 Combo Trials and 1 Combo Challenges
[0:11:48] <Polar_Bair_8> 98UMFE but yeah
[0:11:52] <Vashido22> yeah
[0:12:00] <leith_aziz> Others like Johhny's and Sol's are unnnecesseraily complicated
[0:12:00] <%ggbhtg> Have sample combos ever been optimal in any fighting game?
[0:12:01] <%LastHazzerd> Just stop making video games difficult in any way
[0:12:02] <Polar_Bair_8> he just wanted to see more content for other games too, ppl got offended LUL
[0:12:05] <Vashido22> Lets have both: 1 practical list. 1 challenge for fun list
[0:12:05] <yuribo26> KOF13 trials killing the fgc NotLikeThis
[0:12:06] <Limes528> They're called "Trials". They're meant to be challenging and fun.
[0:12:06] <odd_slater> Alot of trial modes aren't that practical yea
[0:12:09] <leith_aziz> There are easier combos that do the same job
[0:12:12] <AstrodropGaming> Combo trials should have both Practical & In-practical combos
[0:12:14] <%gatorafan> When's TFH trials? Kappa
[0:12:16] <lonosi55> Why are they still talking
[0:12:19] <ponteronten> @leith_aziz Some of Fausts I actually use. Including the double jump install. :D
[0:12:20] <+thedream_c> @trustycoyote i agree on that perception. BUT influencers/content creators can SPIN that in a way (for clout) that makes it negative in a sense.
[0:12:23] <odd_slater> A lot of Anime Illuminati fans today lol
[0:12:23] <+Mordexai0> @Polar_Bair_8 Thanks for the correction I meant to say 98, typo lol
[0:12:28] <%trustycoyote> @ggbhtg I've say Rev2 presents some good "canned" combos that you can use
[0:12:29] <+thedream_c> blame Sajam
[0:12:29] <Polar_Bair_8> it's cool
[0:12:35] <dds333a> Just got here, what's being discussed?
[0:12:35] <Polar_Bair_8> I think it's wild there's a 97 port with rollback
[0:12:36] <AfternoonConcession> if you made the trials like a rhythm game like those one or two gifs then it would make more sense to teach someone how combos work in games
[0:12:37] <Polar_Bair_8> but not 98
[0:12:38] <+thedream_c> i mean blame Panda Globals content creators :p
[0:12:42] <Polar_Bair_8> I guess they wanna space it out?
[0:12:44] <leith_aziz> I think combo trials should be updated after launch when people dicover the optimals
[0:12:47] <%gatorafan> Actually, TFH trials are rad because you can download them from the community
[0:12:50] <leith_aziz> Thats the best way
[0:12:51] <yuribo26> DONT WATCH 13 TRIALS - Jiyuna
[0:12:56] <%trustycoyote> @thedream_c LOL I feel ya
[0:12:56] <Polar_Bair_8> Also yeah I find it weird that multiple people on Panda Global are doing the 13 trial videos
[0:12:57] <@Menitta> Changing the perspective of these trials to "this is just some cool ass shit" make them a lot more appealing imo
[0:12:58] <+thedream_c> @leith_aziz too much work for little return IMO
[0:12:58] <leith_aziz> It gains views
[0:13:05] <leith_aziz> So why not
[0:13:11] <Polar_Bair_8> Isn't the point of picking up people from different games to have them make different content?
[0:13:16] <Vashido22> yeah
[0:13:21] <Polar_Bair_8> Why have multiple ppl on your team making the exact same content
[0:13:26] <Vashido22> you dont need great execution to play kof
[0:13:29] <Vashido22> just go and play
[0:13:29] <Polar_Bair_8> I'm not tapped into this whole esports thing to get it
[0:13:33] <odd_slater> Virtua Fighter when through something similar right?
[0:13:40] <theredfox930000> I think it doesn't matter how easy or hard you make a fighting game people hate losing and will be turned off but if you make a good looking game that can grab people's attention the game will still be popular
[0:13:41] <lonosi55> They bandwagoning idiots ran out of ideas
[0:13:44] <AfternoonConcession> content creators making content is fine and if people are scared of the trials then they weren't going to play the game to begin with
[0:13:52] <%LastHazzerd> Like, ya can't stop that without removing the fun thing from the game. and the fgc sure loves removing stuff and stripping games for the saoe of accessibility
[0:13:53] <+thedream_c> @Polar_Bair_8 its more like the people doing that content are from different FG backgrounds and experiences. But its about the situation for making clicks
[0:13:59] <%gatorafan> At least this means PG stopped mandating tier lists Kappa b
[0:14:01] <@Menitta> I play KOF like Street Fighter and that's it
[0:14:07] <@Menitta> poorly.
[0:14:08] <%RyTYoung> RyTYoung subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! Hey Woolie and Reggie! Just finished Nioh 1 Remaster and I am making my way through the seque, the framerate improvements was desperately needed for the console ports. What weapons are you maining in your play-through Woolie? Have a good day guys!
[0:14:08] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1369188817492656132?s=19
[0:14:18] <yuribo26> Yeah, fuck Jiyuna Kappa
[0:14:21] <+thedream_c> 'sake of accessibility'. AKA i don't want to too much work to perceive that I'm making intermediate progress
[0:14:23] <Vashido22> tbh, learning movement and neutral is harder than combos in kof lmao
[0:14:23] <+Dova573> also is kinda funny that max's kof 13 video is a year old
[0:14:28] <+thedream_c> yeah fuck Brian_F, I mean Sajam
[0:14:28] <leith_aziz> I wouldnt mind if content creators covered more than just ranked matches. Maybe check the gallery and analyze some Art, Music, developåment, Story Etc.
[0:14:30] <Adwark> In kind of way I feel if game included some dev commentary per trial about what is given trial meant to present could be good thing, it could include "that's crazy mad challenge"
[0:14:31] <+thedream_c> I mean Brad Pitt
[0:14:32] <+Mordexai0> @Polar_Bair_8 Yeah its weird, it dropped all at the same time which makes it weird, while max's video was just around the time he was doing a terry retrospective
[0:14:40] <lonosi55> Doesnt woolie already do a podcast on tuesday?
[0:14:40] <yuribo26> Fuck Sajam for saying those stuff
[0:14:46] <+PandaCavalry> I miss SBF play throughs :(
[0:14:50] <+Chubbily> sajamSegue3
[0:14:59] <+Deko_> dont gatekeep my game *proceeds to also gatekeep the game*
[0:15:01] <+thedream_c> uh oh here comes the Sajammers
[0:15:05] <%Akizea> @yuribo26 for what?
[0:15:06] <+thedream_c> sneaking in the cut
[0:15:09] <@Menitta> It's also a misguided blame. It's not a player's fault for showing off part of the game and giving opinions on it. If the trials are bad, that's not Max or JWong's fault
[0:15:12] <Grimsever88> conent creators doing kof13 trials let me see the players execution on a micro level. theyre fun to watch
[0:15:12] <Vashido22> LUL
[0:15:13] <leith_aziz> @Adwark: I hope Strive does that in the future. They are SO close with the movelist. They're on the right track
[0:15:14] <+Chubbily> sajamSegue4
[0:15:17] <Polar_Bair_8> I can't blame people for hopping on the trend but when you have 2 or 3 people on the same team making trial videos it's kinda weird
[0:15:19] <yuribo26> @Akizea Kappa
[0:15:22] <DrBeanie> thank heavens for sajam and jiyuna
[0:15:24] <lonosi55> Sajam a echo chamber
[0:15:25] <%ggbhtg> Mr Sajam of the Illuminati Kappa
[0:15:27] <smiggyballs13> FGC Drama
[0:15:29] <leith_aziz> You mean Brian-F ?
[0:15:38] <%Akizea> @yuribo26 exactly doodLUL
[0:15:39] <%gatorafan> Good ol Ryan F
[0:15:43] <%jinking79> he couldn't beat any of them
[0:15:44] <Polar_Bair_8> @Menitta Isn't the point that content creators could talk about other things in the game? It's like complaining about XIV's graphics, it gets old lol
[0:15:48] <leith_aziz> (im joking)
[0:15:49] <%gatorafan> dammit phone
[0:15:58] <theredfox930000> sajam's nose sucks up all the rollback netcode ryckertBell ryckertBell
[0:15:59] <+thedream_c> like I said its odd. Because panda global making a killing with those vids. But there are other content creators for KOF13 like the Koreans whose made similar and they don't have much clout/clicks
[0:16:01] <Polar_Bair_8> It's not their fault but not wrong to point it out either
[0:16:03] <+thedream_c> like MADKOF and Verna
[0:16:03] <Vashido22> I like how XV looks tbh, I'm fine with it
[0:16:04] <%ggbhtg> B-Ryan F
[0:16:10] <+Dova573> Well also the trials being hard is not bad, Max and Justin love the trials because they are hard
[0:16:14] <+thedream_c> lmaoo b-Ryan eff
[0:16:20] <TheactualDiepod> It's crazy how much charm is lost when fighting games move to 3d
[0:16:22] <DrBeanie> once you figure out the kof execution tricks, they're not that hard really
[0:16:38] <CalderGaming> that was a HUGE TRAP for me on SFIV
[0:16:47] <+thedream_c> for the trials much of the real tricky shit is the minor movement
[0:16:49] <Ardisan_> arc sys really is the only people to keep the charm
[0:16:51] <%Akizea> God I HOPE shermie comes back for 15
[0:16:56] <ponteronten> Sounds like a good idea, Woolie
[0:16:56] <leith_aziz> @Polar_Bair_8: I kinda wanted to see people cover a Gallery mode for example. Check the art, Music, development history, Story Etc
[0:17:00] <+thedream_c> i mean shermie has a SNK Heroines model....
[0:17:00] <AfternoonConcession> kof has their own version of dustloop right?
[0:17:05] <Polar_Bair_8> Samsho 7 looks pretty good but the online stinks
[0:17:06] <Vashido22> Dream Cancel wiki time!
[0:17:06] <BlazingHam> The optimal combos are harder than the trials lol
[0:17:07] <BlackermanZX> i mean they are called trials for a reason LUL
[0:17:07] <+Dova573> Also what else you gonna do with kof 13 when the online is bad
[0:17:13] <%HitchhikingThrough> When's community-created combo trial mods
[0:17:13] <+thedream_c> that said I want MissX, Female SKullomania and Fatal Cuty Terry in KOFXV
[0:17:13] <DrBeanie> I believe it's orochinagi
[0:17:17] <%baka_sugoi> trial by community
[0:17:17] <Ardisan_> @afternoonconcession DreamCancel
[0:17:19] <theredfox930000> woolie smoking that devils lettuce
[0:17:21] <odd_slater> Yea I was gonna say Dream Cancel time lol
[0:17:22] <Adwark> @Akizea Well with Chizuru I could see her and rest of team coming back :)
[0:17:24] <AfternoonConcession> let's go
[0:17:27] <+ekillapa> local test today in a way is I want to see you like the difference in a way and like I want to learn what is considered a practical
[0:17:28] <DrBeanie> yeah dream cancel
[0:17:33] <Vashido22> @odd_slater I mean, it is the best option lmao
[0:17:38] <Vashido22> Dream Cancel time!
[0:17:40] <%Jiggisnipe> exactly Reggie
[0:17:44] <%jaggstar2020> bread and butter with gold laced caviar
[0:17:45] <leith_aziz> I like the colors of KOF XV. its very vibrant, but it doesnt impress me since Strive is right there
[0:17:45] <smiggyballs13> Sounds Fun(tm)
[0:17:45] <Grimsever88> its exepected of korean players who only play kof to already be super goid at the game so them doin trials isnt as appealing to those that dont plsy kof. plus they probably defeated trials years ago
[0:17:52] <+Dova573> if anything is execution practice
[0:17:55] <leith_aziz> Not saying its bad though
[0:17:55] <Man_in_the_Red> @dova573 well, PC netplay's good by virtue of more wired connections
[0:17:58] <CalderGaming> isn't Shermie super dead while Chizuru was just depowered during the Ash Crimson arc
[0:18:01] <leith_aziz> Maybe just not mindblowing
[0:18:02] <@Solidus_113> I learned some good Big Band combos from watching Skullgirls tourneys, more than what I got from the trials
[0:18:09] <CalderGaming> I mean I guess anytthing's possible after the XIV story
[0:18:13] <+Mordexai0> @WoolieVersus Will we see KoF 11 sometime soon? Would love to see that.
[0:18:20] <Vashido22> KOF 14's story ending is literally "anyone can come back" so...
[0:18:29] <+Dova573> Yeah but delay netcode is really bad in a game like kof13
[0:18:34] <@Menitta> i just want Whip and Vanessa to stay
[0:18:39] <CalderGaming> thanks Verse :P
[0:18:42] <leith_aziz> From what I know of XIV, Ash brought everybody back, so anyone can return
[0:18:44] <Vashido22> most of 14's cast will probably stay
[0:18:46] <+thedream_c> yeah execution is practice but notreally the most hand dexterity stuff or hand gymanstics. But just unconscious proficiency with BnBs and basics
[0:18:48] <yuribo26> Thats just an excuse to play boss chracters Woolie DansGame
[0:18:53] <Polar_Bair_8> bring back the USA sports team man
[0:19:01] <lonosi55> How long do they talk for
[0:19:05] <Vashido22> I already have Chizuru back so I'm happy lmao
[0:19:05] <Adwark> They directly shown a bunch of characters getting resurrected at end of KoF XIV, so gates are open for like nearly anyone
[0:19:07] <+thedream_c> Vanessa prolly will stay. Her design in 14 is nice.
[0:19:12] <%HitchhikingThrough> HitchhikingThrough subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 4 month streak! Speaking of combo trials, I really wish fighting games would let you set custom combo trials in training, and then display them in matches like MK. Tried modding it into skullgirls but no dice.
[0:19:15] <Vashido22> @lonosi55 for a long as they want man, you're free to go to another stream
[0:19:16] <+thedream_c> yeah gates are def open. Except for Love HEart
[0:19:20] <Man_in_the_Red> @dova573 delay isnt gonna stop short hop CD so eh
[0:19:22] <BlackermanZX> yeah lets all play rugal StinkyGlitch
[0:19:24] <yuribo26> 5Head
[0:19:25] <leith_aziz> Im still baffled Max still thinks Geese died, when Chat tells him CONSTANTLY that Geese never died in KOF
[0:19:28] <%Jiggisnipe> @lonosi55 check Woolie's twitter, this is a preshow
[0:19:33] <+thedream_c> I HOPE alice comes back from XIV. Alice's design is cute and her play style is rock solid.
[0:19:35] <Man_in_the_Red> wifi would
[0:19:37] <leith_aziz> Its fine, but chat is right there
[0:19:39] <lonosi55> Chill with the salt pls
[0:19:39] <+Mordexai0> @CalderGaming Can't wait for the Maximum Impact characters.
[0:19:40] <@Solidus_113> Them's Fighting Herds does that
[0:19:43] <@Menitta> KOF is weird for me cuz I only like maybe 4 characters and those characters are not always there
[0:19:47] <The_500lb_Child> Can Shingo finally come back in XIV? :(
[0:19:49] <AfternoonConcession> the only thing i'm still getting used to is proximity grabs, that's still messing with me since +R
[0:19:51] <DDDorsett> Geese is dead by Fatal Fury lore
[0:19:55] <smiggyballs13> 🤓
[0:19:56] <%HitchhikingThrough> @Solidus_113 nice
[0:19:57] <Vashido22> god I hope Shingo comes back @The_500lb_Child
[0:20:02] <BlackermanZX> isn't geese dead in fatal fury canon but alive in kof canon
[0:20:04] <Vashido22> I need my dumb boy back
[0:20:06] <%RyTYoung> Te
[0:20:10] <Vashido22> @BlackermanZX yup
[0:20:16] <%RyTYoung> Terry for Kof XV pls
[0:20:19] <yuribo26> Reggie is saying characters are functions
[0:20:20] <Vashido22> Fatal Fury and KOF are different timelines
[0:20:23] <+thedream_c> KOF is less a scientific grindy game than consistency IMO
[0:20:24] <dds333a> I'm very much the opposite
[0:20:26] <+Dova573> Im a feel guy
[0:20:29] <leith_aziz> +R's new Replay mode is amazing and makes a BIG difference. Hope future FG's use that
[0:20:30] <odd_slater> Terry is a shoe in he has to be
[0:20:35] <AfternoonConcession> i still need king and clark in 15
[0:20:44] <+thedream_c> what wins you with KOF is consistent spacing and pressure and defense using movement
[0:20:47] <%ggbhtg> @leith_aziz What do you expect? He was a Capcom kid through and through, as he has said. He's been pronouncing Yuri's last name wrong for years
[0:20:54] <dds333a> Obviously Terry's in, he's there every year
[0:20:55] <+Mordexai0> @BlackermanZX Yes. KoF and Fatal Fury are two different timelines. Geese never died in KoF.
[0:21:02] <Man_in_the_Red> Geese was brought back as a zombie most of his existance so that wont stop him
[0:21:02] <odd_slater> No Terry in a KOF is like not having Mai in a- oh shit.
[0:21:05] <leith_aziz> Will help so much with frustration (when you dont know how you got hit and how to deal with that)
[0:21:18] <Man_in_the_Red> hell, didnt Verse revive the whole KOF cast?
[0:21:18] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:21:18] <+thedream_c> that said in KOF14 I liked the design of Ryo Robert and Yuri. AoF team is easy to flesh out and pick up and play
[0:21:18] <BlackermanZX> I swear to god if King is not in XV imma choke someone wooliePOYO
[0:21:27] <+thedream_c> yeah micro-walks
[0:21:35] <%trustycoyote> @RyTYoung Agreed. My question is do they include Blue Mary and Rock from the start?

[0:21:38] <+Mordexai0> @thedream_c And the kung fu girl from the another world team
[0:21:38] <dds333a> @mordexai0 Hell, even in FF, he came back.
[0:21:38] <+thedream_c> micro dashes and shit. The nitty gritty shmoovment in KOF 13
[0:21:43] <Adwark> @Man_in_the_Red I mean he even got Orochi resurrected without Chris vessel LUL
[0:21:46] <%CaptainPileDriver> I go and find something I like and then see if it's safe and then eventually after I find my own stuff I go and look up stuff I didn't find and implement into my own stuff
[0:21:53] <darkodargon> wooliePOYO
[0:21:54] <%gatorafan> the KOF perfect assistance club is more exclusive than what one would think
[0:22:06] <The_500lb_Child> The reason why they didnt have Mai is cus they didnt know how to draw the jiggle animation Kappa
[0:22:14] <+thedream_c> @Mordexai0 yeah aka the pachinkoverse. But yeah XV is another dream game so will be interesting.
[0:22:14] <+Dova573> I want K9999 Back(not nameless)
[0:22:20] <+Dova573> And I know it will never happen
[0:22:24] <+thedream_c> yeah good luck getting your k999 back
[0:22:30] <Ardisan_> I learn: Systems & Movement > BnB > Specials > Etc
[0:22:30] <leith_aziz> @ggbhtg: I dont know, man. Its clear he's just a guy with a different taste than mine. I mean im a story guy, so when Max glosses over stuff the game tries to bring up as "LORE" I get pissed.
[0:22:36] <dds333a> @the_500lb_child the ass jiggle, clearly
[0:22:42] <+thedream_c> AA's are also 'difficult' in KOF because of spacing/timing
[0:22:43] <+Mordexai0> @dds333a He never really comes back in story. Its why they give him a halo in one of the portraits in one of the games
[0:22:53] <%trustycoyote> Oh man K9999
[0:22:54] <lonosi55> 15 is not a dream game
[0:23:00] <leith_aziz> I love his streams, but I always have to deal with the fact that we are SO different in preferences
[0:23:08] <+Dova573> K9999 design and sound effects are forever ingrained in my mind
[0:23:30] <%gatorafan> just galactica phantom Kappa
[0:23:44] <+thedream_c> yeah juicebox had a checklist of actual solid homework to have before hopping on to netplay
[0:23:55] <+thedream_c> like do you have your AAs, your BnBs, your corner combos
[0:23:57] <leith_aziz> I never played a KOF, I wonder if I will in the future
[0:23:58] <BlackermanZX> is reggie ready for Woolie's Ralf
[0:24:02] <+Dova573> But I hate homework
[0:24:10] <%HitchhikingThrough> wait does the pc version not have online
[0:24:13] <dds333a> @blackermanzx He never is
[0:24:13] <odd_slater> @blackermanzx LOOL
[0:24:14] <leith_aziz> (im gonna stick with Strive for now)
[0:24:14] <+thedream_c> i say its more like homework but its jsut a reference
[0:24:16] <@Menitta> I was gonna say I hope online matches
[0:24:28] <%gatorafan> @hitchhikingthrough it does but it's better on Parsec
[0:24:29] <Grimsever88> bets on how many times regg will get hit by galactica phantom?
[0:24:30] <+thedream_c> so you know what to watch out for what you don't have when you play matches
[0:24:30] <AfternoonConcession> it's old school fighting games so if you have the rhythm you'll do ok
[0:24:36] <lonosi55> Wasnt sajam saying to not learn combos if you want to go online
[0:24:38] <%trustycoyote> @leith_aziz KOF13 is usually on sale and has a good amount of content to chew on even single player
[0:24:38] <Adwark> @HitchhikingThrough It has but well... it's not exactly best, thus Parsec is better option
[0:24:38] <leith_aziz> Cant wait to see some BUFF dudes
[0:24:41] <+thedream_c> LMAOOO uh oh those trials
[0:24:43] <@Solidus_113> the meme will not die
[0:24:45] <+thedream_c> omg perception is a bitch
[0:24:48] <%Jiggisnipe> Kappa
[0:24:52] <+Dova573> I swear I owned kof 13 in steam, but it says I dont anymore
[0:24:56] <+Mordexai0> @Dova573 K9999 has such a cooller design than nameless
[0:24:59] <+thedream_c> i hate some FGs for getting memed hard
[0:25:05] <%Nested_Dreams> woolieACCIDENT Uh oh, the trials! woolieACCIDENT
[0:25:07] <Karhax> its basically speedrunning
[0:25:10] <+thedream_c> like melty bathroom grand finals
[0:25:21] <Karhax> you are not supposed to play like a speedrunner really
[0:25:26] <this_guy_115> Galactica phantom in 13 feels like it has less range
[0:25:29] <BlackermanZX> sadly K9999 is in the copyright death limbo
[0:25:31] <dds333a> @mordexai0 since he's Not-Tetsuo
[0:25:32] <yuribo26> Oh yeah, raiden dropkick
[0:25:35] <Man_in_the_Red> KOF 13 is now 5 dollars on Fanatical
[0:25:40] <+thedream_c> hold D for 30 seconds for max fun
[0:25:44] <leith_aziz> @trustycoyote: You know people dont really say this about FG's but I honestly think KOF has great writing and interactions despite how goofy the game can get
[0:25:45] <+thedream_c> in KOF14 that is Najd
[0:25:46] <yuribo26> Keits the goat
[0:25:50] <lonosi55> FailFish
[0:25:53] <BlackermanZX> did ya check Annie in Skullgirls?
[0:25:54] <leith_aziz> Keits ?
[0:25:56] <%jinking79> Raiden hasn't use kick for 24 sec oh shit
[0:26:01] <%ggbhtg> Keitsuu
[0:26:02] <+thedream_c> oh yeah the Keits plateau tweet
[0:26:05] <leith_aziz> (i've heard of him)
[0:26:06] <%ggbhtg> Lord Keitsuu
[0:26:08] <+thedream_c> yeah he has a good point on that
[0:26:10] <lonosi55> Keit is just repeating sajam or vice versa
[0:26:14] <+Mordexai0> @dds333a Thats the best part. Attacks look cooler than nameless too because of the Tetsuo influence
[0:26:23] <yuribo26> Nah it was the game fault Kappa
[0:26:24] <+thedream_c> yeah people don't know that level when you finally internalize what you have learned
[0:26:30] <leith_aziz> Yeah I think thats kinda right
[0:26:33] <%ggbhtg> @lonosi55 Good opinions are good, whadda ya want?
[0:26:38] <@Menitta> hmm
[0:26:48] <+thedream_c> people keep thinking of ways to get to a point in FG Proficiency where you just the play against he player. But that takes TIME and pracdtice and itnernatlizing what you learned
[0:26:51] <%trustycoyote> @leith_aziz Absolutely. The pre-match banter warms my heart
[0:26:54] <leith_aziz> Grapplers are very guilty of this
[0:26:54] <@Menitta> that is a good post
[0:27:00] <Zerotoad5> watch your owns stuff its painfull but have to do it
[0:27:07] <lonosi55> Lol if thats what you want to believe
[0:27:09] <%gatorafan> instructions unclear. begin smashing buttons
[0:27:09] <Man_in_the_Red> "Lmao im just pressing buttons"
[0:27:12] <+Dova573> I always do after everygame or during a match
[0:27:17] <this_guy_115> I also dislike 13 because of the fact that they simplified a LOT of existing character's movesets, and are seemingly keeping it that way onward. Removing Vice's Slash kicks and TWO of her grabs really nerfs her
[0:27:19] <+thedream_c> because if you haven't internatlized all your lessons, you are still actively thinking about them and NOT looking for things your opponent is doing
[0:27:20] <Vashido22> "im just pressing buttons"
[0:27:21] <+Mordexai0> @BlackermanZX apparently the Akira creator gave Eolith his blessing for K9999 but SNK might not have the same acceptance...also apparently internally SNK hates K9999
[0:27:23] <leith_aziz> @trustycoyote: I like GG's too but I get thats not everybody's preferences
[0:27:27] <Adwark> I just wanna press buttons doodDerp
[0:27:38] <+thedream_c> I wanna press buttons too
[0:27:41] <%Jiggisnipe> it's that fgc meme of the distribution of skill
[0:28:01] <+thedream_c> i think Keits is referring tot he feeling of new players calling it a 'plateau'
[0:28:01] <+Mordexai0> Oh Man, I hope Najd comes back. She was cool
[0:28:09] <DatAsuna> Yeah I'd call that the bare minimum
[0:28:32] <+thedream_c> cuz new players/intermediate ones will hit something that is a knowledge check that they aren't as keen about playing live matches
[0:28:32] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:28:34] <yuribo26> Best friends? FeelsBadMan
[0:28:35] <+megamanx74> but them on blast lol
[0:28:36] <+FuqBoiSlim> "You've established you know how to play"
[0:28:39] <+thedream_c> but think that they could have countered it
[0:28:41] <+megamanx74> put*
[0:28:58] <leith_aziz> (I find the background and characters so interesting, but something dont jive coherently when you Have characters like Sol, Ky, Leo, Sin and Pot who work well and are very connected, but then you have the assasin guild and I-No who are very I guess unconnected)
[0:28:58] <+thedream_c> yeah a big part of it is knowledge checks. Your opponent will do stuff to see how much knowledge u got of the game
[0:28:59] <mark1247> i Still can't believe in 2021, that freaking DOUG (nostalgia critic) is about to beat kingdom hearts 1 on his stream & begin 2
[0:29:06] <BlackermanZX> @Mordexai0 Man what a shame. He was kinda cool. Still i like nameless
[0:29:06] <%ggbhtg> aka Mid Level
[0:29:07] <dds333a> When? Like, 2011?
[0:29:09] <@Menitta> "I beat Arcade mode on medium. Can I go to Evo now"
[0:29:13] <%trustycoyote> @leith_aziz GG is my favorite doodGood
[0:29:25] <+thedream_c> if your opponent gauges that you aren't as knowledgeable, they will just hit you with simple shit until you adapt. If you don't you lose.
[0:29:29] <Vashido22> @mark1247 wait what
[0:29:32] <%ggbhtg> You have now entered "Mid Level"
[0:29:33] <Vashido22> please tell me thats a lie lmao
[0:29:38] <%Nested_Dreams> Man, i remember the days before i internalized what does neutral game mean and how it works in a match
[0:29:47] <mark1247> @Vashido22 yeah he started playing KH heart & he loving it, what a twist
[0:29:50] <Man_in_the_Red> i keep hearing Kingdom Hearts 1 is a cursed LP
[0:29:54] <Vashido22> HOLY SHIT @mark1247
[0:29:57] <+thedream_c> exactly woolie
[0:30:00] <Adwark> @leith_aziz Ah lore/story... also one of reasons I'm waiting for Strive bawkBless and hope I'll get also new Blazblue in future LUL
[0:30:03] <%ggbhtg> @mark1247 @Vashido22 Plays on fridays, just got to final worls
[0:30:04] <%ggbhtg> world
[0:30:06] <mark1247> @Man_in_the_Red yeah he about to beat it
[0:30:09] <leith_aziz> @Man_in_the_Red: Why ?
[0:30:09] <%baka_sugoi> evo15MindBlown evo15MindBlown evo15MindBlown
[0:30:15] <+thedream_c> if you want that true play vs the opponent feeling, you HAVE to drive yourself to that point and proficiency
[0:30:16] <leith_aziz> Its the least complicted one
[0:30:18] <DatAsuna> This also applies to a lot of not-fighting games: intel is king and if the one doesn't know all the pieces on the board it's just a handicap
[0:30:21] <+FuqBoiSlim> @mark1247 D-Does he like it?
[0:30:22] <Vashido22> @ggbhtg goddamn it now I want to watch that NotLikeThis
[0:30:29] <@Solidus_113> brain smooth, hit button until combo go
[0:30:32] <mark1247> @FuqBoiSlim yeah, he about to stream 2 next week
[0:30:35] <%ggbhtg> @leith_aziz Ask Urban Dictionary
[0:30:45] <lonosi55> Kingdom hearts
[0:30:47] <+FuqBoiSlim> that's crazy
[0:30:47] <dds333a> They crouch, and think
[0:30:49] <+thedream_c> the problem is people somtiems practice that combo. But if you can't touch your opponent to combo them, its not happenin
[0:30:50] <Man_in_the_Red> i heard like what, 6 failed Lets Plays of KH, not even including TBFP
[0:30:50] <+Dova573> Ok time to change EVERYTHING
[0:30:53] <+blastazoid00> I do that :(
[0:30:54] <DatAsuna> If you're playing a card game and you have to ask your opponent to explain what their card does, you're still learning
[0:30:57] <NeonBleu> when you break the spirit
[0:31:00] <+yukichocomilk> braindead LUL
[0:31:00] <+CuppaJo3> ah yes, the LTG Special

[0:31:09] <Vashido22> He doing STRINGS

[0:31:21] <+thedream_c> @DatAsuna well in some cases you ask to assume there is a big mechanic that allows them to go off.
[0:31:24] <+blastazoid00> Im a filthy casul
[0:31:25] <357Sneak> got played by Tyson
[0:31:27] <+CuppaJo3> he doin STRINGS
[0:31:28] <Vashido22> He's doing STRINGS
[0:31:37] <+thedream_c> !strings
[0:31:38] <%ggbhtg> This is where the Tekken player disconnects after the match ends
[0:31:42] <%ggbhtg> and it's only 0-1
[0:31:43] <+Dova573> The best feeling is doing that to someone whos gameplan is to parry everything in thirdstrike
[0:31:49] <%jinking79> KI
[0:32:00] <+Dova573> Oh you thought I was gonna press a button?!
[0:32:02] <+thedream_c> but MUH HAND GYMNASTICS FeelsBadMan

[0:32:08] <%trustycoyote> @ggbhtg The internet just went. Dunno wut happened bro
[0:32:09] <leith_aziz> @Adwark: Funnily enough, my friend considers buying Strive JUST for the story (Ram is his main and I think he likes her character development). Also for your sake, lets hope you get a new Blazeblue
[0:32:15] <+heyitsdenzel_> @WoolieVersus thanks for liking my tweet
[0:32:18] <smiggyballs13> This whole conversation feels like it’s speaking directly to me on that game plan stuff.

[0:34:04] <leith_aziz> I main Sol, and I still cant deal with good Sols
[0:34:05] <@Menitta> wait you fought Daigo?
[0:34:08] <@Menitta> Kappa
[0:34:08] <leith_aziz> WHAT ?
[0:34:10] <dds333a> At least Woolie knew how to play
[0:34:11] <+Dova573> is like trying to play against Arturo like you are playing Fchamp
[0:34:12] <lonosi55> this story again
[0:34:19] <fruit_pie_the_magician> That Hwoarang mirror match in one of the tournaments was a nice example
[0:34:22] <%ggbhtg> "You've studied the blade, but you haven't studied MY blade"
[0:34:26] <Adwark> The magic of games where characters movesets are capable of expressing various styles
[0:34:26] <@Solidus_113> the plan to out footsie
[0:34:28] <andre11dr> Oh i remember this story
[0:34:28] <Man_in_the_Red> in games where you only have so many tools to work with people develop new habits to not get buried
[0:34:32] <+thedream_c> or the rest of the SFV dhalsims. They all bring something different. Like Cmdr Jessie
[0:34:32] <OldManDeckardCain> I'm still sad daigo is playing guile over ryu NotLikeThis
[0:34:36] <@Menitta> out footsie daigo
[0:34:55] <%ggbhtg> @OldManDeckardCain we can't all be low tier heroes
[0:35:01] <leith_aziz> @OldManDeckardCain: Still ? I thought he turned to E.Honda ?
[0:35:12] <andre11dr> Well ,Daigo just didn't gave a fuck and hit you with 5 DPs
[0:35:15] <+thedream_c> u know which ryu u didn't fight to learn fireball optimal style? JOHN CHOI
[0:35:16] <OldManDeckardCain> ye
[0:35:18] <leith_aziz> Has he not given Ryu a shot again ?
[0:35:18] <Lobster_Lord> u guys remember how many ume shoryu's woolie ate at evo?
[0:35:27] <+thedream_c> John Choi will live and die off his well placed fireball game in SF4
[0:35:40] <OldManDeckardCain> guile is supposedly still better than ryu
[0:35:41] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:35:55] <+thedream_c> RENT FREE in ur head
[0:36:07] <Grimsever88> ie random playing Kappa
[0:36:08] <%ggbhtg> daily reminder: fighting games are just hard, yo
[0:36:13] <andre11dr> Daigo has wierd wakeup tactics to ,it's like when you get the knocks you're still guessing
[0:36:13] <+Dova573> This is shonen shit I fucking love
[0:36:16] <Lobster_Lord> We're stuck on a whole different PLANET
[0:36:24] <dds333a> Yeah.
[0:36:29] <yuribo26> Pog
[0:36:33] <+thedream_c> should have approached it like how Smug did vs Daigo back in SF4
[0:36:34] <kikoeru_san> oh shit Woolie's playing my jam today?
[0:36:50] <kikoeru_san> KoF XIII is sick
[0:36:53] <%LastHazzerd> The more all rounder the character the more playstyles there are of them
[0:36:54] <%gatorafan> Woolie was grinding one the Red Patrol and then he went to fight Frieza
[0:37:05] <andre11dr> That wasn't even Evil Ryu Daigo too
[0:37:05] <Man_in_the_Red> @kikoeru_san yeah that Combo Trial game is cool Kappa
[0:37:09] <Lobster_Lord> Reggie is so right
[0:37:12] <yuribo26> DAIGO'S AURA monkaS
[0:37:14] <+thedream_c> yeah all around chars def invite more ways to express their toolkit
[0:37:15] <%mtlsars> Dont give credit to you opponeent that he doesnt deserve yet
[0:37:22] <+thedream_c> E RYU was interesting too under different players
[0:37:29] <+Dova573> the Spiritual PRESSURE
[0:37:29] <lonosi55> @Lobster_Lord then why is Woolie ignoring him
[0:37:32] <+thedream_c> E Ryu daigo was a combo dropper. But dude was clutch as hell.
[0:37:34] <yuribo26> HAKAN YEYEYE
[0:37:35] <leith_aziz> Sounds stressful
[0:37:42] <+thedream_c> E Ryu Sako however is more of a combo nerd
[0:37:42] <yuribo26> HAKAN MY BOY
[0:37:46] <Lobster_Lord> @lonosi55 idk
[0:37:46] <kikoeru_san> @man_in_the_red dude it's really not that, XIII is a game where BnBs will see you through
[0:37:49] <dds333a> Hakan is pretty real
[0:37:51] <BlackermanZX> hakan players monkaS
[0:37:54] <+thedream_c> E Ryu Lil Evil was just Axe Kick confirms
[0:38:00] <leith_aziz> Hakan is so goofy to play
[0:38:06] <+thedream_c> Infiltration Hakan :p
[0:38:09] <@Menitta> this IS some shonen shit
[0:38:29] <%Akizea> fighting games are shounen shit
[0:38:32] <leith_aziz> Remember that tournament against Balrog ? They chose Hakan to win
[0:38:44] <+kamikazecashew> tornament arc every time
[0:38:49] <leith_aziz> "The answer lies in the heart of battle"
[0:38:52] <DatAsuna> it was
[0:39:04] <+thedream_c> yeah in KOF play styles are also near and dear
[0:39:18] <+thedream_c> especially since many players will hav ea gang of chars they can control
[0:39:32] <+thedream_c> and some really favor different tactics over others
[0:39:46] <@Menitta> yeah I like to bully
[0:39:46] <+Dova573> Me learning charge character in third strike is when i had my most growth
[0:39:49] <dds333a> They just get in
[0:39:54] <leith_aziz> Slayer
[0:39:57] <+thedream_c> exactly
[0:40:00] <@Solidus_113> Tianhuo is a huge bully
[0:40:04] <leith_aziz> I HATE good Slayer that never defend
[0:40:18] <+Dova573> Dealing with Urien aegis set ups in the corner with Q makes you learn real quick
[0:40:24] <andre11dr> Yeah my GG defense is not the best and i main Slayer
[0:40:37] <Suleks> I have the opposite problem of playing too much hakumen and not having any rush down pressure with anyone
[0:40:42] <+thedream_c> with GG though its more about matchup nuance
[0:40:44] <leith_aziz> (I meant GOOD Slayers. Not Slayer players in general)
[0:40:52] <+thedream_c> like with Slayer you lick your lips when u go up against Chipp or Millia kinda
[0:40:55] <@Menitta> this is another enlightening fg discussion I'll try to think about later
[0:40:55] <Man_in_the_Red> Slayers know that defending is death, so avoid defense by winning before needing to
[0:41:00] <leith_aziz> I play Sol so maybe its just me
[0:41:02] <+Dova573> More recently I beat this good milia in the strive beta, because I was just blocking her shit
[0:41:11] <Man_in_the_Red> in other words hope for Danger Time LUL
[0:41:13] <+thedream_c> but you HOPE you also don't get vaporized trying to get mixed against Chipp/Millia
[0:41:24] <andre11dr> Slayer is like ,too hits can kill so you better get them
[0:41:27] <+thedream_c> wellthat too. Danger time and hope the chipp/millia got triscuits for defense
[0:41:31] <OldManDeckardCain> melty does that to you
[0:41:32] <leith_aziz> Though honestly I play Leo as wel, so I guess im a hypcrit
[0:41:33] <lonosi55> Ok lets start the game now
[0:41:34] <@Solidus_113> SS4 Gogeta came out too. actual boss character status
[0:41:40] <leith_aziz> SS4 Gogeta ?
[0:41:48] <dds333a> Yeah, GO-1 was aggressive in DBFZ, and that game rewards it
[0:41:48] <BlackermanZX> so whens Annie StinkyGlitch
[0:41:52] <leith_aziz> (not a question)
[0:41:56] <andre11dr> Dog SS4 ia SO BULSHIT
[0:42:04] <+thedream_c> GO1 gets rewarded in dbfz for actualy playing high level defense
[0:42:10] <Man_in_the_Red> @leith_aziz another Goku, but this time with taunt buffs and a double airdash
[0:42:13] <andre11dr> You can comand throw into IK
[0:42:23] <DatAsuna> That's a good one
[0:42:25] <+thedream_c> since GO1 doesn't shy away from holding down back for 20-30 seconds and moving in ways to avoid bad situations
[0:42:25] <%RyTYoung> Street fighter 2 SNES for me
[0:42:26] <leith_aziz> I used to love MK, but now I HATE all NRS games. Its a shame
[0:42:27] <%ggbhtg> appblepsep tuuuuuukin
[0:42:28] <epsypepsy> Kof 13 underrated imo
[0:42:32] <DDDorsett> SSJ4 Gogeta? More like DEAD
[0:42:34] <DatAsuna> I didn't try SF till alpha max 3 xD
[0:42:34] <@Solidus_113> Marvel 1 on PS1 was mine
[0:42:36] <DDDorsett> 4Head

[0:45:54] <andre11dr> The state is pretty evil
[0:46:02] <Polar_Bair_8> If you want a game where everyone has a divekick, try Dan-Ku-Ga
[0:46:13] <Polar_Bair_8> clamhaClamW
[0:46:22] <yuribo26> "Kind of"
[0:46:24] <sonofthedeepsouth> Kinda
[0:46:25] <DatAsuna> They've been trying to get off of being just an oil economy for decades now
[0:46:27] <sonofthedeepsouth> he is
[0:46:31] <andre11dr> Like they stone women and they cut hands and a hole bunch of other shit
[0:46:32] <Lobster_Lord> Saudi has their hand in a lot more things than people realize
[0:46:35] <leith_aziz> So let me be honest, Im an arab and I dont know who this Prince is (I live in EU now). Im sorry if this is true
[0:46:43] <leith_aziz> Not all of us are like that
[0:46:44] <DatAsuna> lot of failed real estate projects in that regards too
[0:46:44] <bigshedman> Get into international politics PogChamp
[0:46:48] <leith_aziz> Im sorry Woolie
[0:46:55] <%ggbhtg> The Dissident, I see..
[0:47:04] <DatAsuna> Oh not even close, it's just tourism marketing
[0:47:07] <sonofthedeepsouth> POG HUMAN SUFFERING POG
[0:47:08] <leith_aziz> Fuck...
[0:47:12] <leomuratore> Preach Woolie!!!
[0:47:13] <Adwark> @leith_aziz That's more usual stuff "rich people with political power" no matter the country
[0:47:14] <BlackermanZX> ugh its so fucked up
[0:47:15] <marshalmorphino22> Let’s not forget about Yemen too
[0:47:21] <Grimsever88> @leith_aziz nah you good, we know, its like saying all americans are like trump
[0:47:23] <yuribo26> You hate capitalism yet you have an iphone? Intriguing, I'm inteligent
[0:47:23] <marshalmorphino22> You didn’t forget about Yemen, did you?
[0:47:29] <+samuraiknack> I hope to have a beard and afro combo one day
[0:47:34] <Lobster_Lord> if u consume disney stuff you support a company that work with literal nazis in china
[0:47:37] <DatAsuna> Had some awkward talks about that specifically nowdays
[0:47:37] <odd_slater> Real doomer hours who up fuck...
[0:47:40] <gunsrlove> We will talk more politics when the CCP owns ALL of gaming
[0:47:40] <leith_aziz> I feel really bad now
[0:47:44] <andre11dr> SOMETHING YOU OWN is probably made by slaves
[0:47:44] <Man_in_the_Red> @grimsever88 except in the america case its true Kappa
[0:47:58] <sonofthedeepsouth> JUST BOMB THE CCP
[0:48:01] <%Necnill> Yikes!
[0:48:02] <sonofthedeepsouth> BOMB IT
[0:48:02] <yuribo26> Thats duper fucked up
[0:48:02] <Oak_bogle> We are now in the backyard.
[0:48:05] <sonofthedeepsouth> BOMB EM
[0:48:05] <Grimsever88> @Man_in_the_Red dude you dont know how hard i fought to not put a kappa in XD
[0:48:09] <sonofthedeepsouth> KILL EM
[0:48:15] <@Menitta> @sonofthedeepsouth chill a bit
[0:48:17] <dds333a> @oak_bogle Always were
[0:48:17] <%TopTieramisu> bending the knee for such a mediocre film
[0:48:18] <sonofthedeepsouth> DESTROY MY SOCIAL CREDIT SCORE
[0:48:19] <DatAsuna> I hope Mihoyo never gets bought by tencent for similar reasons
[0:48:20] <+thedream_c> CCCP and Esports is an interesting angle too
[0:48:20] <%KeiganOfAstora> Just tuning in. Who said what?
[0:48:21] <+Troispoint> The US protects and helps Saudi Arabia at every turn. It's not like you can vote with your dollars against that regime.
[0:48:30] <Oak_bogle> @dds333a fair
[0:48:45] <odd_slater> @keiganofastora someone asked about the SNK Saudi thing
[0:48:47] <gunsrlove> Also, China does a whooole lot more than just the Uighur stuff
[0:48:54] <%KeiganOfAstora> What's the SNK Saudi thing?
[0:49:02] <Lobster_Lord> Mihoyo will for sure bend the knee, assuming they haven't already
[0:49:03] <@Menitta> Its fucked up no matter where you look
[0:49:11] <%ggbhtg> I don't want to generalize this as another "Chinese Overlords" scenario, but I do understand what you're talking about.
[0:49:14] <Grimsever88> I respect where you stand with this woolz
[0:49:21] <CalderGaming> @KeiganOfAstora he just started talking about it 2 minutes ago
[0:49:22] <leith_aziz> Is the Company DIRECTLY related to the Prince ? If its just an Arab Company, dont worry
[0:49:24] <%jepupu> China money is all good. But wait til they start pulling strings and banning streaming rights from political dissenters.
[0:49:27] <%RyTYoung> It's a wild situ
[0:49:29] <sonofthedeepsouth> The Uighuirs the Tibetans the Mongolians all being anihilated because of the ccp
[0:49:36] <leith_aziz> Otherwise, I understand completely
[0:49:37] <Man_in_the_Red> @leith_aziz direct in this case
[0:49:38] <leomuratore> Don't forget that Worldcup stadiums in Qatar are being built with slave labor.
[0:49:38] <+thedream_c> @jepupu on some wumao shit
[0:49:53] <%BusterRepukken> I accepted a long time ago that my money is going to shitty people no matter what, so I'm just gonna buy things I like.
[0:49:54] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:49:55] <sonofthedeepsouth> The Manchus dont even count as a Ethnicity anymore
[0:49:55] <gunsrlove> @sonofthedeepsouth most if not any who are not Han Chinese
[0:49:56] <@Menitta> KOFXV was at least in development since early 2019
[0:49:58] <%TopTieramisu> coming soon: The King of Fighters for Men Only
[0:50:00] <andre11dr> That's a lot of countries that America is supportive of
[0:50:02] <Lobster_Lord> honestly, the saudi royal family is almost unavoidable in the tech field right now
[0:50:11] <sonofthedeepsouth> The Manchus are fucking gone
[0:50:13] <leith_aziz> Im not a KOF player, so maybe I can just avoid getting in for now. I have GG for now
[0:50:19] <+thedream_c> yeah in some fields u def can't avoid these big players
[0:50:23] <%Zanzibar_Junker> Saudi Arabia even has their own anime movies
[0:50:23] <DatAsuna> yup
[0:50:34] <+Troispoint> The US decided after World War 2 to placate and help Saudi Arabia in exchange for their oil. It's what's at the heart of it.
[0:50:34] <lonosi55> If thats your logic woolie then just dont buy anything ever again
[0:50:37] <leith_aziz> Its fine to consider this Woolie. You're being conflicted and thats human
[0:50:41] <yuribo26> I'm with you Woolie evo18Heart
[0:51:03] <dds333a> @leith_aziz there's plenty of older installments to look at as well, if you're interested
[0:51:08] <andre11dr> Basically society is fucked and you'll lose somewhere with something, but still it's good to criticize
[0:51:08] <Man_in_the_Red> i mean, usually its worse than you'd think so if THIS is the public stuff then HOO BOY
[0:51:11] <%Necnill> Necnill subscribed at Tier 1.
[0:51:18] <+Troispoint> Like there's a US sponsored Yemen famine going on as of now, because they'll keep supporting Saudi Arabia.
[0:51:20] <xUrbanCarnage> I’m playing 15 regardless
[0:51:20] <%ggbhtg> Yeah, the problem I was having before this was that I only have an idea of how bad the SNK deal could be, with not as many details behind it
[0:51:23] <%Nested_Dreams> Shares based ownership is also so messy, my company is now owned by 4 different shell companies just so some people have various degrees of control, and it's not clear where the money goes
[0:51:27] <SpookyBeef7> "Don't ask questions, just consume product."
[0:51:35] <lonosi55> dont worry. woolie will end up playing 15 regardless too

[0:51:40] <OldManDeckardCain> wasn't kof 14 made with chinese blood money anyway LUJL
[0:51:42] <OldManDeckardCain> LUL
[0:51:44] <%Nested_Dreams> SNK will probably be sunken into ownership obfuscation as well
[0:51:45] <leith_aziz> @dds333a: I know, im just not in a hurry
[0:51:47] <xUrbanCarnage> Can’t no dictator stop me from doing Vice combos
[0:51:49] <%ggbhtg> I wanted actually details ,and now I have more than I did
[0:51:50] <%ggbhtg> Thank you
[0:51:53] <%BusterRepukken> everything has chinese blood money these days.
[0:51:55] <%Necnill> Clap
[0:51:56] <odd_slater> Have people made peace with it or are most people just not in the know?
[0:51:56] <%ggbhtg> *actual details
[0:51:58] <dds333a> @leith_aziz Makes sense
[0:52:03] <leomuratore> Clap
[0:52:15] <andre11dr> @oldmandeckardcain The argument is that It MIGHT not have been
[0:52:16] <leith_aziz> I'd get so conflicted if a game im looking for is owned by a company like this
[0:52:21] <Lobster_Lord> its expected, people can't possibly have the mental and emotional energy to care about every issue out there. some people aren't as invested. as long as we acknowledge it and not deny the truth.
[0:52:25] <OldManDeckardCain> eh
[0:52:26] <sonofthedeepsouth> Chat lets talk about fucked history of the saudi family rise to power and how they used the Grandpa of ISIS to take power of the region
[0:52:28] <leith_aziz> I guess im glad I cant relate really
[0:52:32] <Man_in_the_Red> most people just dont know / outright dont give a shit because it isnt a visible issue so it isnt real
[0:52:35] <+thedream_c> I think SNK ALl Stars is mostly profited by the korean devs
[0:52:37] <%LastHazzerd> if it's unfair to them, tough, that's life, they're no longer them, they're a branch of the problem
[0:52:40] <+thedream_c> tho the IP is through SNK
[0:52:45] <%BusterRepukken> @Lobster_Lord thats how I feel. I only have so much emotional bandwidth.
[0:52:49] <xUrbanCarnage> If the devs aren’t killing anyone idc
[0:52:50] <%Jiggisnipe> SNK has been owned by other "interesting" companies and those companies are owned by "interesting" individuals
[0:52:52] <Oak_bogle> @ggbhtg I see you around a few streams and I appreciate your good questions dood.
[0:52:52] <+Troispoint> The human suffering math is too overwhelming to grasp either way
[0:52:58] <+Nekros4442> They're no longer just SNK. It's shit up thats how it is if the sale goes through
[0:53:01] <leith_aziz> But doing the right thing is probably whats best
[0:53:02] <+RowenCleric> well said Woolz
[0:53:02] <%ggbhtg> the endless gray sea of politics
[0:53:04] <%LastHazzerd> one good individual doesn't justify a problematic system
[0:53:07] <leith_aziz> Even if its hard
[0:53:09] <%KeiganOfAstora> @WoolieVersus Are you reading the Attack On Titan manga or just the anime?
[0:53:10] <%ggbhtg> gotcha

[0:54:06] <+thedream_c> majinobama did KOFXIII trials a fun way when he streamed it ages ago
[0:54:12] <+thedream_c> but sadly he never monetized it :(

[0:56:37] <Grimsever88> i love how kof is mostly dominated by mexio/korea
[0:56:38] <kikoeru_san> This game is nightmare with controller set up

[0:58:30] <+thedream_c> vice and mature be lesbian ghosts
[0:58:31] <gunsrlove> EX Kyo top tier
[0:58:33] <Limes528> KOF has the best cast of any FG series imo
[0:58:39] <dds333a> @menitta yeah, '99 Kyo
[0:58:40] <Lobster_Lord> i didn't know Woolie was part of Panda Global
[0:58:40] <odd_slater> Why is evil hot lady in suit so damn strong
[0:58:46] <+thedream_c> oohhh baby
[0:58:46] <%trustycoyote> Oooo Kim is fun too
[0:58:47] <%TopTieramisu> nests kyo best kyo
[0:58:47] <sonofthedeepsouth> Just Pick a top tier
[0:58:50] <kikoeru_san> yes, this game has flame Iori, NESTS Kyo, and Mr.Karate as ex characters
[0:58:54] <DingusMcBaseball> king <3
[0:58:57] <andre11dr> Every EX caracter is fucking godlike
[0:58:59] <leith_aziz> SO like Dustloop ?
[0:59:00] <sonofthedeepsouth> Pick a Top Tier
[0:59:01] <yuribo26> King evo18Heart
[0:59:02] <marshalmorphino22> @thedream_c hard to beat a base roster of 58 chars. Unless you’re smash
[0:59:03] <sonofthedeepsouth> YO
[0:59:04] <%TopTieramisu> i miss kyo's autoguard prior to nests but that drip
[0:59:05] <+thedream_c> look at them cmd normals
[0:59:07] <kikoeru_san> King is top tier
[0:59:13] <+goney> King PogChamp
[0:59:15] <andre11dr> But Mr Karate is the light and the way
[0:59:20] <Reckless_Rob> King is also rad
[0:59:20] <leith_aziz> King is so cool

[0:59:29] <Roasted_Pheasant> We goin hard mode

[0:59:34] <Man_in_the_Red> @sonofthedeepsouth @
[0:59:35] <%TopTieramisu> king and yuri's proportions were a little weird for me in 13
[0:59:40] <this_guy_115> KOF LORE TIME: for 13 and 14, Vice and Mature are poltergeists haunting Iori as insurance, as they were sent by Orochi to make sure the new big bads don't mess with his power
[0:59:41] <Grimsever88> more meter = number go big
[0:59:43] <+thedream_c> more resources = maybe char should be anchor
[0:59:49] <Aganok_> oh shit, it's Tekken notation
[0:59:55] <leith_aziz> King > All (aside from Blue Mary. She's cool as well)
[0:59:56] <Man_in_the_Red> Yuri and Athena look funky in 13
[1:00:00] <yuribo26> Get into googling combos
[1:00:01] <Lobster_Lord> Mai + King Kreygasm
[1:00:01] <Aganok_> kinda
[1:00:05] <+thedream_c> less resources for solid reward = char maybe should be point or mid
[1:00:09] <%TopTieramisu> blue mary's back Kreygasm
[1:00:16] <dds333a> Kim and Takuma were absolute ridiculous tier, and King was zoned extraoirdinare
[1:00:20] <convo445> people say kof13 has less moves than other games in the series, what is the community's opionion on that?
[1:00:26] <kikoeru_san> Woolie, King has easy conversions off HK
[1:00:29] <+thedream_c> Blue Mary in KOF14 is hilarious with some combo routes

[1:00:51] <leith_aziz> @this_guy_115: So I thought Orochi was a bad guy. Why would he protect Iori ?
[1:00:56] <Limes528> @convo445 It's true., unfortunately. The game is still incredible though, so it doesn't really matter

[1:02:03] <%TopTieramisu> @Afterman_ snyder's justice league cut: the game?
[1:02:03] <dds333a> @leith_aziz Iori got that Orochi blood due to his family, and thus Orochi could incarnate through him, possibly. Vice and Mature are interested in Iori because they might be able to use him to resurrect Orochi
[1:02:03] <Limes528> Love his vids

[1:02:49] <spinbel> Why does a combo video need to be private?
[1:02:50] <dds333a> Hell, Vice and Mature have history with Iori because Iori straight up killed them in '96
[1:02:52] <bigshedman> @dds333a So is Iori actually a badguy or not? Since he's in Kyo's team for XV?
[1:02:53] <lonosi55> Anyone else hope they remove team battles from KofXv

[1:05:18] <+TenguGemini> This is one of the prettiest fighting games ever, god damn
[1:05:20] <%Tekraider> Tekraider subscribed at Tier 1.
[1:05:30] <%TopTieramisu> this game is so gorgeous it bankrupted snk again
[1:05:31] <%BusterRepukken> shame no one bought it
[1:05:33] <TheactualDiepod> My man is off screen with the bus ass
[1:05:36] <convo445> kof evo finals were they hypest, change my mind
[1:05:37] <%Tekraider> been a while guys!
[1:05:40] <%BusterRepukken> this is one of the worse selling KOF games
[1:05:41] <%TopTieramisu> imagine if this game had good netcode
[1:05:42] <dds333a> Umanori'd the shit out of him
[1:05:43] <leith_aziz> I feel so bad that it did poorly
[1:05:46] <+thedream_c> lmaoo meterless
[1:05:49] <+thedream_c> he starts with 5 bruh
[1:05:49] <leith_aziz> What a shame
[1:05:52] <%Jiggisnipe> Kappa
[1:05:59] <%livlinn> woolieKICKDAD_RB
[1:06:01] <Roasted_Pheasant> psaCrazyhead
[1:06:04] <+thedream_c> its training mode so unless that meter in the bottom starts at 0, these are high resourced combos
[1:06:10] <leith_aziz> I think it was just an overinflation of games on the market
[1:06:12] <%TopTieramisu> these BG characters got so much love
[1:06:21] <leith_aziz> Not more complicated than that
[1:06:25] <Grimsever88> can someone jsut make a rollback laser gun and shoot rollback into all FGs?
[1:06:26] <+vaporousTippler> I bought this on two platforms. I did my part.
[1:06:29] <+thedream_c> oh yeah the feature in KOF13 is being to cancel specials to specials
[1:06:30] <sonofthedeepsouth> Top tier
[1:06:38] <+thedream_c> soyou gotta play with that as a mindset
[1:06:45] <dds333a> @toptieramisu absolutely amazing cameos too. Tam Tam is in this stage
[1:06:45] <leith_aziz> So KOF has TOD's ?
[1:06:45] <%BusterRepukken> i find KOF 14 better because its fun.
[1:06:49] <leith_aziz> Ahhh
[1:06:51] <leith_aziz> I see
[1:06:57] <convo445> yeah but look at this game though
[1:06:58] <+thedream_c> yep
[1:07:06] <sonofthedeepsouth> Mahvel
[1:07:07] <%livlinn> woolieKICKDAD_RB woolieFABRICATION_RB
[1:07:13] <%livlinn> woolieSMUG_RB
[1:07:13] <+thedream_c> exactly who u deleting
[1:07:14] <@Menitta> I like playing KOFXIV more than XIII in general
[1:07:17] <+thedream_c> and u gotta get the touch
[1:07:25] <+thedream_c> last char has 5 max
[1:07:31] <sonofthedeepsouth> woolieKICKDAD_RB
[1:07:36] <+thedream_c> also depends how fast chars make meter
[1:07:50] <+samuraiknack> Does the background animation get faster when you start attacking?
[1:07:51] <+thedream_c> whiffing cmd normals, grabs, moves can also generate meter too especially if its worth it
[1:07:52] <leith_aziz> DBFZ is the only team game I've played. Sometimes fun but for the most time VERY frustrating
[1:07:52] <%BusterRepukken> People get hung up on graphics way too much
[1:07:55] <evan451> Interesting
[1:08:02] <Grimsever88> imagine if 14 has 15s graphics....
[1:08:09] <Grimsever88> *had
[1:08:10] <arkvc> this game is borderline pornographic
[1:08:18] <%TopTieramisu> imagine if arcsys made a kof game
[1:08:27] <arkvc> imagine...
[1:08:28] <+thedream_c> oooh elisabeth
[1:08:31] <%Zanzibar_Junker> Everyone in background look rough
[1:08:33] <%BusterRepukken> I wouldn't want an Arcsys KOF.
[1:08:34] <Grimsever88> even better
[1:08:36] <convo445> do people already know about any gameplay differences for 15 compared to 14
[1:08:37] <leith_aziz> @BusterRepukken: I mean its what draws you in in the first place. It should impress you
[1:08:39] <+thedream_c> I did like Elisabeths KOF13 design
[1:08:41] <sonofthedeepsouth> slowmo
[1:08:42] <Man_in_the_Red> @toptieramisu it wouldnt have good movement so whats the point
[1:09:00] <dds333a> Straight into the HD
[1:09:01] <leith_aziz> Graphics matters. Thats an undeniable truth
[1:09:08] <arkvc> 15 doesn't look a lot better than 14 in the looks department
[1:09:11] <+thedream_c> figthing games are a visual medium
[1:09:12] <Man_in_the_Red> just look at granblue, no airdashes makes it feel like misery
[1:09:16] <+thedream_c> along with audio
[1:09:17] <%TopTieramisu> @Man_in_the_Red i'd imagine it'd still be directed heavily in the gameplay perspective by SNK
[1:09:18] <Afrosamasenpai> Just looking at these are making my hands hurt
[1:09:26] <KatyParry_FGC> @arkvc you are lying
[1:09:27] <+thedream_c> so fgs with visuals/audio that works is always a plus
[1:09:27] <%TopTieramisu> gameplay aspect*
[1:09:30] <%BusterRepukken> 15 looks leagues better than 14, tired of hearing this.
[1:09:32] <BlazingHam> Persona always does max damage
[1:09:34] <dds333a> I think these are all corner
[1:09:41] <357Sneak> lytBADMAN FBBlock FBBlock CurseLit
[1:09:43] <xUrbanCarnage> Noooo Yuri
[1:09:44] <+thedream_c> corner carry
[1:09:45] <%TopTieramisu> looking better than 14 isn't a great bar
[1:09:47] <+Rekinsinn> that one piece tribute tho
[1:09:53] <convo445> 15 is a vast improvement especially Kyo's face
[1:09:55] <dds333a> Well, fuck me
[1:09:56] <yuribo26> @xUrbanCarnage what
[1:09:59] <%Nested_Dreams> That was a delete with 2 bars
[1:10:00] <Aganok_> 15 upgraded from late ps2 to late ps3, it's a big jump
[1:10:01] <xUrbanCarnage> The one piece gear 2
[1:10:03] <EmiHyper7> 15 looks way better than 14
[1:10:03] <+thedream_c> Ralf is a killer. IF u can get the touch :p
[1:10:09] <Grimsever88> 15 is leaps better looking than 14
[1:10:10] <@Solidus_113> so, Ralf wants his jump-ins
[1:10:11] <lonosi55> Kof 15 is just the graphic mod pack for Kof14
[1:10:11] <sonofthedeepsouth> MatureI'dLiketoFuck
[1:10:12] <KatyParry_FGC> if you think 15 doesnt look vastly better than 14 your lying
[1:10:13] <leith_aziz> I will say, KOF XV has great color variety. Looks very vibrant
[1:10:18] <xUrbanCarnage> In game Yuri lmao @yuribo26
[1:10:24] <arkvc> yeah 15 just looks like its got a few more shaders
[1:10:27] <leith_aziz> Though its not mindblowing is all I'll say
[1:10:30] <+thedream_c> damn the micro movements
[1:10:30] <yuribo26> @xUrbanCarnage evo18GG
[1:10:35] <+thedream_c> VERY key details there
[1:10:43] <bigshedman> XV looks better in the sense that it seems to have an actual art direction. XIV looked like a mess with the realistic individualized hairstrains and textures on the clothing, but soft shadows and no lighting effects.
[1:10:43] <+thedream_c> to get some of these combos hitting
[1:10:52] <KatyParry_FGC> if you think the next ____ game needs to break the mold in the looks department, still wrong
[1:10:53] <Grimsever88> shaders arent gunna make kof14 faces better LuL
[1:10:56] <%TopTieramisu> of course it looks better than 14. but how does it look for a game in 2020? i'm happy they're improving but it's not beyond criticism
[1:10:56] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1369188817492656132?s=19
[1:11:01] <%TopTieramisu> 2021*
[1:11:03] <%ChoculaUltra> kinda wish there was a funnier name for microwalks like scooches or something
[1:11:06] <%TopTieramisu> i still got 2020 brain
[1:11:07] <leith_aziz> @bigshedman: Yeah, I think thats how I would sum it up
[1:11:12] <leith_aziz> AYAYAAYAAYAA
[1:11:14] <convo445> you know what is up with billy kane's idle animation in this game, am i the only one who finds it weird?
[1:11:19] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[1:11:20] <+Mordexai0> @arkvc Look at Andy and Shun compared to 14. Those are NOT shaders
[1:11:20] <%Tenchi_G> KOF Trials are madness sajamDelay
[1:11:21] <dds333a> Into the Neo Max
[1:11:22] <leith_aziz> Oh no
[1:11:22] <MackFighters> when they adding rollback to this game lytLEERY
[1:11:29] <Aganok_> games only need to not be ugly, which Kof14 was
[1:11:35] <Roasted_Pheasant> @leith_aziz It's more ELELELELELELELELELELELE
[1:11:38] <@Menitta> no. make it bigger
[1:11:43] <whimsicallifestyle> nah make it bigger
[1:11:46] <KatyParry_FGC> @ChoculaUltra that would make notation easier. st.C qcff.A scootch st.C qcf.A
[1:11:50] <+vaporousTippler> Want to shrink it? Don't get hit.
[1:11:56] <Saltmeisterr> 1 (SIXTEEN) 6 BEAT
[1:12:00] <alphalejandro> People ask for this kind of graphics again and don't realize that this sprites were a major reason for SNK going into their 2nd bankruptcy
[1:12:02] <%gatorafan> Arcsys saw this and found it LACKING
[1:12:08] <dds333a> 32 BEAT
[1:12:12] <%BusterRepukken> even Max called people out for saying 15 looks bad, lmfao
[1:12:16] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[1:12:18] <leith_aziz> @Roasted_Pheasant: You know whats my headcannon ? ARIARIARIARIARI....
[1:12:21] <+thedream_c> yeah the sprites were SUPER expensive and weren't flexible
[1:12:23] <leomuratore> Arcsys: Needs bigger combo counter
[1:12:27] <%TopTieramisu> asking for sprites in 2021 is delusional
[1:12:29] <+thedream_c> like SUPER expensive
[1:12:40] <lonosi55> Max is a fighting game shill. he will defend anything that has bad graphics, MVCI INCLUDED.
[1:12:41] <sonofthedeepsouth> Just do the Sprites tho
[1:12:45] <RompFGC> all this ralf love hurts for us clark players
[1:12:46] <sonofthedeepsouth> Just do it
[1:12:47] <xUrbanCarnage> Show them anywhere juggle system combos with Vice
[1:12:48] <+thedream_c> like th DLC chars made weren't even making money for what they were charged :p
[1:12:49] <Equirah> never wasn't
[1:12:49] <Man_in_the_Red> @toptieramisu and yet Skullgirls and SOR4 exists
[1:12:50] <fruit_pie_the_magician> But LOOK at it though
[1:12:56] <%BusterRepukken> >max is a shill ok bro
[1:12:59] <KatyParry_FGC> clark has never been shunned
[1:13:01] <convo445> big UI nonsense matter less to the players than the spectators, it certainly distinct in strive
[1:13:03] <KatyParry_FGC> ppl love clark
[1:13:04] <Man_in_the_Red> also Blasphemous, a playable goddamn Fresco
[1:13:06] <Aganok_> Skullgirls can only afford like 2 characters a year, and that's because they also get money with the Mobile game
[1:13:07] <%TopTieramisu> how old is skullgirls again?
[1:13:16] <xUrbanCarnage> 7 years?
[1:13:19] <+thedream_c> @Man_in_the_Red yeah content wise those 2 games aren't really pushing shit either
[1:13:20] <%TopTieramisu> and sor4 isn't a fighting game
[1:13:20] <sonofthedeepsouth> jesus
[1:13:22] <leith_aziz> @BusterRepukken: To be fair that was more considering the standards (though again, it is a pretty game, just not mindblowing)
[1:13:26] <+Mordexai0> @lonosi55 MvCI constantly says MvCi looks shit but plays well, and it does.
[1:13:27] <+thedream_c> Annie came out like... 7 years after?
[1:13:37] <%TopTieramisu> adding characters to an existing game is not making a game from scratch in the current era
[1:13:37] <Grimsever88> man its almost like you can critique some parts of a game while praising other parts. MVCI looks trash all round but had good gameplay
[1:13:39] <%demystify_fist> no one plays skullgirls to the degree that capcom or snk want people to play street fighter or kof
[1:13:40] <Equirah> @Man_in_the_Red skullgirls aint sprites
[1:13:41] <sonofthedeepsouth> Iori
[1:13:43] <this_guy_115> THE MAIN problem 13 has imo is the simplification of movesets that carried on over to 14 and potentially 15
[1:13:47] <%BusterRepukken> @leith_aziz Im not saying its mindblowing, just people saying it looks like a PS2 game annoy me.
[1:13:47] <+thedream_c> @Mordexai0 replace MVCI with KOF14 in that statement and it also makese sense
[1:13:52] <xUrbanCarnage> Skullgirls was still great tho
[1:14:02] <KatyParry_FGC> @Grimsever88 nobody does that for SNK games. they criticize then dissapear
[1:14:06] <Man_in_the_Red> @equirah yeah its MORE expensive and time consuming to make
[1:14:08] <this_guy_115> removing STAPLES like Kim's rekka kicks or 2 of Vice's main grabs
[1:14:09] <+Mordexai0> @thedream_c Yep. KoF 14 plays great
[1:14:10] <%Tenchi_G> LUL
[1:14:11] <xUrbanCarnage> I’m glad they started doing more
[1:14:15] <+thedream_c> i mean gameplay is also pretty subjective too
[1:14:18] <leith_aziz> @BusterRepukken Would you feel better if I said it looks like a PRETTY PS3 game with alot of color ?
[1:14:20] <ponteronten> A good theme in this KOF
[1:14:22] <sonofthedeepsouth> This game was made Baras and thats its only issue
[1:14:22] <Aganok_> Skullgirls is hand-drawn animation, it's so much more expensive than sprites
[1:14:22] <+thedream_c> like some people LOVE Fantasy Strike
[1:14:25] <Grimsever88> @KatyParry_FGC BibleThump
[1:14:25] <Man_in_the_Red> they just dont know how to Market sprites
[1:14:30] <dds333a> @toptieramisu launch party going for nine years
[1:14:33] <RompFGC> KOF 14 is my favourite KOF game to play. shame about the netcode
[1:14:34] <lonosi55> KofXV dont look bad but it does look last generation
[1:14:34] <KatyParry_FGC> kof 14 is a great product. yea it doesnt look great and i get why thats an issue but overall, great product
[1:14:36] <+Reverend_Roscoe> he a big bowa
[1:14:42] <alphalejandro> What i'm saying is that KOF13 was a gamble for SNK and they lost that gamble
[1:14:43] <convo445> So when people say the movesets are smaller but the combo trials are insanse where does it come down on? Is it inputs?
[1:14:46] <+thedream_c> and I feel Fnatasy Strike for being way too EZ in their approach doesn't retain a committed playerbase
[1:14:55] <KatyParry_FGC> i dont think SNK lost that gamble
[1:14:56] <bigshedman> I would trade in all the SNK sprites for XV to have some good fucking netcode. XIV was attrocious.
[1:14:59] <dds333a> @convo445 yes
[1:14:59] <Aganok_> Kof15 is pretty enough that it doesn't turn me away, unlike 14
[1:15:03] <this_guy_115> @convo445 yes
[1:15:08] <%TopTieramisu> so almost a decade old game. skullgirls isn't a modern game anymore
[1:15:11] <Equirah> what's the site woolie's using?
[1:15:16] <%BusterRepukken> i guess im a gameplay is king kinda guy
[1:15:16] <xUrbanCarnage> I remember watching the streams where Alex Ahad was drawing the sprites for robo fortune and they take F O R ever
[1:15:18] <%TopTieramisu> it's still getting updated but it's not indicative of the current industry
[1:15:21] <leith_aziz> @Aganok_ Thats good for you
[1:15:22] <@Menitta> KOFXIV had that lighting patch
[1:15:22] <convo445> So other games can have long combos with less hassle
[1:15:24] <%BusterRepukken> KOF 13 is pretty but its missing so much stuff.
[1:15:28] <%gatorafan> @equirah Dream Cancel
[1:15:29] <xUrbanCarnage> But they turn out amazing
[1:15:30] <KatyParry_FGC> if there is 1 KOF that ppl would pay $ and attention for if it got a significant update, it'd be 13
[1:15:31] <andre11dr> Yeah KOFIII had so much put into ir that it almost made them bankrupt again
[1:15:36] <KatyParry_FGC> still 10 years later
[1:15:37] <Equirah> @gatorafan ty
[1:15:44] <KatyParry_FGC> ppl that never played this game rant about it
[1:15:53] <+thedream_c> yeah KOFXIII wasn't a financially feasible game reagrdless of how much of a visual feast it was
[1:15:55] <+OroOreo> The god ralf
[1:15:59] <Roasted_Pheasant> Do KoF combos feel more like Street Fighter or like Guilty Gear?
[1:16:04] <+Boner_Girl> Ralf and Clark are beefy bois
[1:16:06] <dds333a> @katyparry_fgc true enough
[1:16:09] <Man_in_the_Red> @katyparry_fgc and yet they wont, just look at 2002UM's retention
[1:16:13] <%BusterRepukken> @Roasted_Pheasant they feel like KOF.
[1:16:14] <alphalejandro> Also, while KOFXIV was bad looking, was still a better game than both, SFV and MVCI, like way better game, at least IMO
[1:16:17] <+thedream_c> meanwhile Tekken 7 was made with a much smaller budget than tag and seems to have pocketed them the biggest change in recent games
[1:16:18] <KatyParry_FGC> thats 2002
[1:16:20] <lonosi55> Snk bankrupt
[1:16:20] <this_guy_115> SNK was already struggling financially before 13, it was the equivalent of a box office bomb
[1:16:30] <xUrbanCarnage> Ppl that rant about 13 say 2002 is too hard
[1:16:33] <leith_aziz> When people design Sprite, I dont mind going for cartoony drawings. That way you can stretch and add cool effects
[1:16:34] <%TopTieramisu> SNK is the sega of the FGC
[1:16:41] <ponteronten> Looking at these two character, it reminds me of their inclusion on Metal Slug. Now I want a port of MS6 for the pc
[1:16:45] <KatyParry_FGC> SNK is the Konami
[1:16:46] <this_guy_115> characters were even scrapped due to time constraints and/or not enough money
[1:16:47] <+thedream_c> well the sprites were made for '12' in mind. So they moved on from that first phase and 13 was suppose to be the upgrade game
[1:16:53] <leith_aziz> @thedream_c That was thanks to Akuma and how bad SFV was doing
[1:16:54] <alphalejandro> @this_guy_115 exactly, like a i say, it was a gamble
[1:16:55] <Roasted_Pheasant> I just don't wanna have to do one frame links and plinks. Is KoF that kind of game?
[1:17:03] <Man_in_the_Red> @toptieramisu you mean has a library of IP they dont even remember?
[1:17:05] <leith_aziz> It was less about how the prev games did
[1:17:08] <convo445> You know it is heart warming to know that everybody thinks the execution was always insane, now a new generation can taste the nonsense
[1:17:10] <ponteronten> starts with a low hit too
[1:17:12] <%TopTieramisu> how is it konami? it constantly tries to revive itself to make more games. konami noped out of games to cash in on pachinko
[1:17:12] <this_guy_115> geese and Adelheid were scrapped and Geese's them is still in the game as one of Billy'a themes
[1:17:15] <KatyParry_FGC> there are some 1 frame links in KOF sure, it aint 1fl heavy though
[1:17:18] <Man_in_the_Red> SNK has World Heroes character picks,
[1:17:23] <Aganok_> @Roasted_Pheasant KOF has a lot of links, it isn't gatlings like anime fighhters
[1:17:24] <HelluvaNohbody> @TopTieramisu That's scary accurate
[1:17:28] <dds333a> @thedream_c yeah, XII was just a tech demo for the Taito Type X2
[1:17:32] <KatyParry_FGC> also, KOF 13 is currently on sale @ fanatical for $5
[1:17:38] <%BusterRepukken> @Roasted_Pheasant KOF 14 eased up on that stuff alot but it still exists. 14 is a much easier game to play.
[1:17:44] <bigshedman> @this_guy_115 You mean we missed out on a KOF13 Geese sprite?!
[1:17:44] <KatyParry_FGC> the KOF triple pack also on sale for $13
[1:17:46] <leith_aziz> So its like Strive style links ?
[1:17:47] <andre11dr> Yeah people say they want a new CVS and I'm like, not if they don't let SNK design it,let Capcom do the visuals and presentation
[1:18:11] <+thedream_c> @leith_aziz not necessarily. Tekken 7 is a solid 3d FG IP. Tekken Team had less budget to work with in 7 but milked the profits via arcade and even in console release and content.
[1:18:11] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:18:16] <this_guy_115> Just give me Kim's rekkas and Vice's slash kick back PLEASE, and her air throw grab...
[1:18:22] <dds333a> Lmao, the taunt
[1:18:23] <Man_in_the_Red> @andre11dr and then all the hair will be clipping into the floor
[1:18:26] <this_guy_115> YEAY
[1:18:29] <alphalejandro> Oh and this time, please share the money Capcom, please
[1:18:30] <+FuqBoiSlim> I mean CVS we're always capcom games no? it was SVC chaos that was made by SNK
[1:18:37] <+thedream_c> yeah CVS then was a product of its time when both companies were passionate about FGs
[1:18:48] <convo445> Besides ArcSys i don't think the other big fighting game companies will ever try to replicate sprites again
[1:18:50] <%BusterRepukken> I much prefer 15's artstyle to SFV.
[1:18:57] <%mtlsars> CApcom really nailed it well for CvS2 and did justice to the SNK characters
[1:19:02] <+thedream_c> ASW's approch to sprites is also different with the BB titles
[1:19:04] <leith_aziz> So I understand people dont want Arcsys to do every FG cause that would oversaturate the style, but its still a good artstyle in the end. Just some inner thoughts
[1:19:08] <+maximrx78> SFV looks like buttcheeks
[1:19:10] <%demystify_fist> it's possible capcom can make good fighting games now that ono is gone
[1:19:10] <%mtlsars> much more than the other way around for SvC
[1:19:11] <+thedream_c> as BB uses sprites but use a 3d model skeleton
[1:19:13] <%Jiggisnipe> 5851634
[1:19:14] <Grimsever88> love the snk sprites in CVS2
[1:19:17] <deafmelone> It took me years to figure that characters actually had taunts in this game lol
[1:19:29] <%TopTieramisu> can capcom just pay the fortnite modelers to redo all the sfv characters?
[1:19:30] <%BusterRepukken> @leith_aziz I care about gameplay and Im not crazy about Arcsys gameplay.
[1:19:31] <+player2side> try j.D for mix maybe?
[1:19:36] <this_guy_115> LOL his mid-tackle sprite
[1:19:41] <lonosi55> @player2side They dont read the chat
[1:19:44] <convo445> @leith_aziz some smaller indie devs are trying to emulate arcsys's style with some good examples i think
[1:19:44] <+thedream_c> @TopTieramisu too much of a price for Cpacom FG division.
[1:19:50] <%TopTieramisu> not a big fan of chun's fortnite face, but the body is impeccable
[1:19:50] <deafmelone> never set them as a button
[1:19:59] <+thedream_c> remember capcom's main money divisions are MHW, the RE Team
[1:20:05] <leith_aziz> @BusterRepukken I guess I can understand where you're coming from (I cant relate really)
[1:20:05] <+player2side> of course lol curious if that works tho
[1:20:08] <+thedream_c> and maybe Itsuno's gang too
[1:20:16] <dds333a> @deafmelone it's also useful, because IIRC, Chin's taunt would automatically drunk him up
[1:20:23] <KatyParry_FGC> i just want SNK to get better at the Quality of life aspect of their games. Lobbies/Netcode/DLC/Story/Simultaneous release window/crossplay/crossbuy etc etc etc
[1:20:28] <deafmelone> cool
[1:20:28] <%BusterRepukken> @leith_aziz also if they just made every fighter, shit would get boring super quick.
[1:20:29] <dds333a> if it finished
[1:20:29] <Aganok_> SF5 looks pretty good for some characters, Kof15 looks consistently meh so far
[1:20:32] <KatyParry_FGC> i already know they can make a fun game
[1:20:35] <+thedream_c> Fortnite knew how to make Chun move well using UE4
[1:20:46] <deafmelone> didnt know that
[1:20:49] <leith_aziz> @convo445: Yep. Skullgirls and TFH look great
[1:20:51] <+thedream_c> something SFV animators still lacking ;p
[1:20:55] <%TopTieramisu> sfv ken
[1:21:08] <andre11dr> 15 looks meh because i assume will get shit loads of caracters
[1:21:12] <%BusterRepukken> People really tried to tell me SFV Ken looks better than XV Andy
[1:21:19] <leith_aziz> SFV is very 50/50 on models
[1:21:23] <%Akizea> now that companies are finally getting netcode down, maybe we can start actually asking for shit for fighting games lol
[1:21:25] <this_guy_115> KoF has never really changed story-wise, its not SUPER complicated like other FG's, and its arguably one of the ONLY games with a "linear" plot
[1:21:30] <%mtlsars> 3S was made in 1998 and still looks better than SF5 characters
[1:21:36] <alphalejandro> For me SFV looks very "messy", i don't like how that game looks

[1:21:45] <KatyParry_FGC> @WoolieVersus after a qcf.C you can cr.C or st.D or micro run into st.C qcf.C again
[1:21:48] <+FuqBoiSlim> @busterrepukken yeah, who ever told you that was smoking crack. SNK slander gets ridiculous sometimes
[1:21:48] <%TopTieramisu> the clipping also ridiculous in sfv
[1:21:50] <+thedream_c> yeah u know which models were done in house/done well in SFV
[1:21:51] <andre11dr> I imagine will get around 50 caracters at launch for 15 so that's why it looks just fine
[1:21:53] <dds333a> @busterrepukken Banana Ken monkaS
[1:21:55] <%TopTieramisu> especially the freeze frame at the end of rounds
[1:21:56] <+thedream_c> andsome models which were meh in design
[1:21:58] <%BusterRepukken> SFV has a weird art style and I dont like a lot of the males have Hulk hands and feet.
[1:21:59] <Aganok_> yeah, I prefer a game like Kof15 that looks consistenly ok over something like SF5
[1:22:24] <lonosi55> Sfv still sell more than any Kof game ever so Lol
[1:22:27] <Aganok_> specially considering the huge Kof rosters
[1:22:32] <alphalejandro> KOF15 looks clean, i like it
[1:22:38] <KatyParry_FGC> ^
[1:22:41] <leith_aziz> @BusterRepukken I think thats intentionall to draw attention to those body parts (where the attacks come from)
[1:22:47] <+thedream_c> kofXV proll gon have a like 10-15 teams and 2 bosses
[1:22:52] <+Rekinsinn> this game had a weird input buffer where you could hold down the button to repeat input for a few frames, no?
[1:22:57] <+thedream_c> so Verse may come back or a variant
[1:22:58] <+Mordexai0> XV looks good so far. Very Stylized. Like how FEXL is Stylized.
[1:23:06] <%TopTieramisu> the difference in quality in the same game is massive: menat's animation in general vs cammy's air throw for example
[1:23:08] <%Javaa01> @TopTieramisu Yeah they use way too many jigglebones to shortcut needing to do actual keyframed animation, so a lot of the character animations look really sloppy
[1:23:11] <KatyParry_FGC> @Rekinsinn there is a button hold trick in 13 yes
[1:23:15] <Man_in_the_Red> @lonosi55 and MK11 has infinite marketing money... doesnt make it feel good to play
[1:23:17] <+thedream_c> @Rekinsinn like a negative edging I think. depends on the combo being done.
[1:23:29] <this_guy_115> KOF FACT #186: All the designs are great minus falcoon's MI designs. The only other place with such CONSISTENTLY AWESOME designs is Guilty Gear
[1:23:34] <leith_aziz> I dont find FEXL "stylized", but im not mad or anything considering the budget
[1:23:35] <andre11dr> Chat arw are we really having this KOF vs SF argument, you know that this shit is like 25 years old and nobody ever won right?
[1:23:38] <leith_aziz> It is what it is
[1:23:39] <%BusterRepukken> also yeah, thats another factor. KOF rosters are huge so that affects graphical fidelity as well.
[1:23:55] <%TopTieramisu> oof. falcoon's OCs
[1:23:56] <+thedream_c> FEXL isamaizng if you consider they are small company and Mihara is the lone lead programmer
[1:23:59] <%BusterRepukken> @andre11dr that was one guy bringing up SF v KOF sales because he wants to start shit.
[1:24:01] <Aganok_> Capcom definitely won, they havent gone bankrupt yet
[1:24:05] <+thedream_c> the SAME lone lead programmer who figured out rollback for the game
[1:24:16] <this_guy_115> KoF sprites were always more about the fluidity of the animation than their overall appearance
[1:24:19] <lonosi55> Capcom won. multiple times. snk went bankrupt, thats pretty much the equivalent of defeat @andre11dr
[1:24:21] <+thedream_c> when u refer to capcom, u have to refer to the different divisions. Cuz some divisions make moneyt han others
[1:24:23] <alphalejandro> @Aganok_ That's because MH and RE
[1:24:27] <%TopTieramisu> who's comparing capcom to snk on equal footing?
[1:24:31] <%TopTieramisu> this isn't the 90s
[1:24:32] <dds333a> @this_guy_115 How dare, Falcoon is fucking awesome. yeah, I agree, some of them look stupid. but i love most of them. dude has style
[1:24:34] <+maximrx78> I love both series.. dosent hurt to discuss art style
[1:24:36] <%BusterRepukken> @TopTieramisu morons
[1:24:38] <+thedream_c> for example what has been bringing up capcom in the last 10 years financially was def MHW and refresh of RE
[1:24:39] <Revzero25> Who cares which is better both series are great
[1:24:47] <leith_aziz> Apparently SFV made most of its money back thanks to the costumes
[1:24:52] <+Mordexai0> @leith_aziz I find it 'Stylized' in that it's a small budget and they made the models work well with the lighting and the budget. It feels like it's stylized just a bit but just enough.
[1:25:01] <Aganok_> what's the issue with comparing how the games look? they're competitors in the same space
[1:25:06] <KatyParry_FGC> @WoolieVersus cr.B st.C
[1:25:08] <+thedream_c> SFV also looks like they were working on a semi shoe string budget so who knows
[1:25:13] <+Mordexai0> @revzero25 Agreed
[1:25:13] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:25:16] <dds333a> Some humid links out here
[1:25:17] <+FuqBoiSlim> Those Chun-li costumes been putting in work LUL
[1:25:23] <+thedream_c> so its easy to make money back when u have a small budget to begin with
[1:25:25] <this_guy_115> @dds333a Idk man, giving a girl shooty disks and tech glasses and xalling her a ninja doesn't sound right to me
[1:25:29] <%TopTieramisu> looks like they're trying to catch juri up
[1:25:30] <leith_aziz> @Mordexai0 Again, whatever works for them. I completely understand that they were in a rough spot
[1:25:42] <%TopTieramisu> juri getting both slots of the character submission contest
[1:25:46] <+Mordexai0> The only real thing I'm interested in SFV is the Eleven Only Tournaments.
[1:25:49] <%TopTieramisu> that was hilarious
[1:25:56] <+Mordexai0> @leith_aziz They're still in a rough spot
[1:25:57] <dds333a> @this_guy_115 idk fam, sounds good to me. but yeah, I get you
[1:26:00] <KatyParry_FGC> ralf might be your last SFV dlc character
[1:26:04] <lonosi55> more people would get into Kof if it wasnt a team game
[1:26:04] <alphalejandro> Also, for those who thinks that Maximillian defend bad looking games, no, he defends MVCI because nostalgia BS, that's why
[1:26:04] <+thedream_c> but ambitious ass financial projects like KOFXIII when SNK was already bleeding (and trying to pachinko) is where you see a series possibly die
[1:26:05] <KatyParry_FGC> big ralf fits SFV's look
[1:26:14] <+Mordexai0> 'Tighter than that' - Woolie 2021
[1:26:15] <+BarbosaEdit> yoooo
[1:26:20] <%TopTieramisu> true. he looks like a rambo ryu
[1:26:22] <+thedream_c> KOF isn't really a team game per se.
[1:26:25] <+BarbosaEdit> KOFXIII best KOF
[1:26:36] <%BusterRepukken> ... KOF 98?
[1:26:37] <Man_in_the_Red> Ralf looks Huge Quest enough for SFV, sure
[1:26:39] <+thedream_c> also KOF is a game gauged heavily on mechanical consistency
[1:26:43] <%mtlsars> there used to be assist or like strikers
[1:26:45] <@Menitta> Be sure to follow the twitter account KOF Hitboxes
[1:26:45] <Revzero25> 2002
[1:26:46] <Man_in_the_Red> wont happen but i could see ir
[1:26:46] <%TopTieramisu> there was a tag kof
[1:26:47] <%mtlsars> in 98?
[1:26:51] <@Menitta> that twitter is....amazing
[1:26:52] <+Mordexai0> @thedream_c KoF 11 is team based
[1:26:53] <+thedream_c> KOF11 was the ONLY tag game
[1:26:54] <@Solidus_113> KOF has character specific combos doesn't it?
[1:26:56] <%TopTieramisu> kof 11
[1:27:07] <andre11dr> I'll be real i have no interest in SFV i thought G was cool but that was last time i saw the game, i didn't even checked out the Dan shit
[1:27:08] <+BarbosaEdit> @thedream_c wrong, KOF03 too
[1:27:09] <+thedream_c> I dont' remember if KOF has naunced char sepcific combos
[1:27:12] <KatyParry_FGC> @Solidus_113 noooot really
[1:27:15] <alphalejandro> KOF'98 is the "SF2 of KOF"
[1:27:24] <+Mordexai0> @thedream_c 2k3 was also, 11 just perfected it
[1:27:26] <%mtlsars> not dreamatch though
[1:27:27] <+thedream_c> damn KOF2003. Well guess I pissed off that player base
[1:27:31] <%TopTieramisu> and MOTW is the 3S of SNK
[1:27:34] <this_guy_115> KOF FACT #182: A lot of 13's roster was designed to look more like their original game counterparts, that's why Athena and the Ikari warriors have such an overhaul
[1:27:36] <convo445> i wonder what prompts these periods of reminiscing of fighting game bs, sbf seemed to always be in that mode
[1:27:37] <%mtlsars> like kof 99 you could call an assist a la MvC
[1:27:38] <%TopTieramisu> the mythical game everybody says they love
[1:27:50] <+thedream_c> @TopTieramisu like 3S fans huh
[1:27:53] <+BarbosaEdit> @thedream_c what player base? lol
[1:27:53] <andre11dr> KOF2003 is like a wack 11
[1:27:55] <+thedream_c> and old GG fans
[1:27:58] <this_guy_115> MOTW isn't the 3S of SNK
[1:28:01] <KatyParry_FGC> @this_guy_115 ppl complain about ANdy/Terry size in 13 but they were big from jump street
[1:28:03] <+thedream_c> @BarbosaEdit you tell me.
[1:28:09] <KatyParry_FGC> glad they didnt give kim his OG big arms though
[1:28:16] <leith_aziz> I played Zeku and G for some time. But I dont really have ann interest in SF generally, so I fropped it
[1:28:17] <convo445> you know the internet is filled with poser just like me
[1:28:21] <KatyParry_FGC> also happy with skinny joe in 13. it makes sense to my eyes
[1:28:24] <leith_aziz> Personal preference, really
[1:28:26] <andre11dr> There's no reason to play 2003 when 11 exists
[1:28:28] <+thedream_c> if ya'll loved your Terry you shoulda played him in garou
[1:28:34] <+thedream_c> orFatal Fury special
[1:28:38] <+Mordexai0> @andre11dr yea
[1:28:38] <+thedream_c> or Real Bout Special
[1:28:41] <%TopTieramisu> rekka terry
[1:28:41] <+BarbosaEdit> @andre11dr hell yes
[1:28:49] <+BusterRepukken> Real Bout Fatal Fury Special
[1:28:52] <KatyParry_FGC> @WoolieVersus just look up Ralf Stun combos, that will give you some nice ideas
[1:28:52] <leith_aziz> Hope Terry keeps his Gauto look
[1:28:57] <leith_aziz> Gauro
[1:29:03] <%TopTieramisu> garou
[1:29:03] <dds333a> @katyparry_fgc a bit of a tangent, but I wish they brought back Kim's Houo Kyaku phoenix
[1:29:05] <%mtlsars> MoTW is a gem of a fighting game, scene never picked up locally but when i watch high level online i always wonder... what if
[1:29:08] <bigshedman> XIII Joe is great because you rarely get those kind of super-toned, mostly-sinew kind of character designs.
[1:29:15] <alphalejandro> Chat, what's better, regular Terry or Garou Terry?
[1:29:21] <%BusterRepukken> Ill never own MOTW on neo geo because it costs like 2 grand
[1:29:22] <+thedream_c> motw high level is NOT just Kevin Rian matches
[1:29:25] <%TopTieramisu> garou. is that even a question?
[1:29:26] <leith_aziz> I like both looks of Terry
[1:29:30] <+Mordexai0> remember when Fatal Fury had a Clockwork Orange reference character?
[1:29:31] <%Afterman_> woolie coughing from the smoke
[1:29:33] <dds333a> @alphalejandro the latter, without question
[1:29:34] <KatyParry_FGC> @dds333a it would be nice detail, yes. i want your team on the stage BG also
[1:29:46] <Triplicat> (coming soon)
[1:29:48] <leith_aziz> I think I like Gauro more because it shows how much Terry has grown up
[1:29:54] <%TopTieramisu> @thedream_c you're right. there's a lot of
[1:29:56] <%TopTieramisu> grant
[1:29:57] <leith_aziz> Now that he takes care of Rock
[1:30:02] <+thedream_c> the worst lie fed bout Garou is at some piont its just Kevin mirrors. Grant is EZ top tier to pick up
[1:30:07] <andre11dr> High level Garou is fucking hype
[1:30:11] <Revzero25> I kinda like his Fatal fury look more
[1:30:14] <dds333a> @mordexai0 Umm, the guy from Dominated Mind?
[1:30:19] <+thedream_c> and Kain is pretty dangerous too with his gimmick
[1:30:22] <dds333a> White?
[1:30:30] <deafmelone> Both are cool, Garou Terry needs more appearances
[1:30:38] <leith_aziz> At the same time, Terry's trucker look is so iconic
[1:30:39] <fernanda_ps2> terry and kain can fight the top tiers p well
[1:30:40] <+thedream_c> plus some Garou chars if you have the consistent execution are pretty gdlk like Gato
[1:30:50] <leith_aziz> But personally, I want more Gauro Terry
[1:30:51] <+BusterRepukken> i hope geese is in 15.
[1:30:55] <+thedream_c> or Jenet's stuff
[1:30:58] <+Mordexai0> @dds333a Yea. Actually appears in the back of a KoF game. Kinda wish he came back.
[1:30:58] <KatyParry_FGC> i can tell you a bit of basic ralf stuff if you guys want? @WoolieVersus sorry for spamming you
[1:31:01] <+thedream_c> Geese was in 14 and will be in 15
[1:31:03] <deafmelone> I also dont mind Another Terry from 2006
[1:31:06] <Revzero25> I need shingo in 15
[1:31:11] <andre11dr> I wish they brought Garou Terry just because i want him recas back
[1:31:15] <OblivionSword1> long hair Terry needs to be in more games
[1:31:16] <Darren716> ResidentSleeper
[1:31:17] <leith_aziz> Geese will deffinetly come back after T7
[1:31:18] <convo445> Is Garou 2 still on the table?
[1:31:20] <KatyParry_FGC> goootcha, my bad
[1:31:22] <%TopTieramisu> i love seeing dong hwan played at a high level
[1:31:25] <leith_aziz> People will know him
[1:31:32] <%BusterRepukken> I want my pretzels
[1:31:37] <hamahiroyuki> woolieYE_RB
[1:31:42] <+thedream_c> Dong Hwan high level is def smart shit. I tried him and I'm not a fan of his hit and run play style which I thought I'd vibe with.
[1:31:50] <KatyParry_FGC> cr.B st.C qcf.C cr.C is a nice 1
[1:31:54] <+thedream_c> odd enough I find Jae Hoon more my type of char
[1:31:55] <fernanda_ps2> misconception. katy parry is always watching kof streams and helping people out
[1:32:00] <KatyParry_FGC> ^
[1:32:04] <+BarbosaEdit> i need Marco Rodriges in XV
[1:32:13] <this_guy_115> Marco Rossi?
[1:32:14] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:32:16] <+thedream_c> Kushnood Buttwould be cool to see
[1:32:25] <hamahiroyuki> woolieACCIDENT_SQ does it work
[1:32:27] <+thedream_c> Kushnood Butt, King of Dinos, whoever else
[1:32:27] <%mtlsars> hes in the takuyma stage background in the trial mode which i find really cool
[1:32:35] <andre11dr> @busterrepukken well they replaced them with double hadoken in KOF 14 so they gone
[1:32:40] <dds333a> @thedream_c Same, I gel with Jae Hoon more
[1:32:41] <this_guy_115> We need a STUDENT TEAM with SHINGO, BUTT, AND MAY LEE
[1:32:55] <+thedream_c> who gon teach Shingo in 15? Alice?
[1:32:57] <%BusterRepukken> @andre11dr I guess people complained.
[1:33:00] <%TopTieramisu> there's no way may lee is coming back
[1:33:08] <%gatorafan> May Lee needs to be in more games
[1:33:10] <fernanda_ps2> i gotta believe
[1:33:12] <KatyParry_FGC> this isn't too useful but ralf has a micro run combo. st.C qcf.C micro run st.C
[1:33:15] <+thedream_c> oh lord 14 invitation team in 15...
[1:33:17] <Revzero25> Might just be me but I think shingo is better than dan
[1:33:20] <%TopTieramisu> you can definitely feel that may lee was an eolith requiest
[1:33:24] <this_guy_115> OR YEAH ALICE, a team of protege's joining up like the women team
[1:33:30] <+thedream_c> I like Mian. Sand emo guy is whatever. And Silvie I'm kinda whatevs
[1:33:32] <%mtlsars> k9999 please lol
[1:33:33] <leith_aziz> I like stuff that requires timing, but I dont like 1-frame links. I dont mind links that give better reward if they're perfectly timed
[1:33:34] <+vaporousTippler> Going with the mouse cursor as a striker is a bold choice.
[1:33:35] <%BusterRepukken> because Shingo is high tier with his critical hits gimmick.
[1:33:37] <+thedream_c> Mian is actualy a super fun gimmick char
[1:33:39] <alphalejandro> I think that i want to Takuma (Ryo and Yuri's dad) to came back, him and his invisible proyectiles
[1:33:45] <dds333a> Yeah, you don't want the Vulcan punch out of that
[1:33:47] <this_guy_115> Shingk with the BEESH BASH BAKAAAN
[1:33:50] <%HungryHungryEmu> learning kofs seem nightmarish compard to dbfz the tech and combos arent easily found
[1:33:52] <%BusterRepukken> Shingo is a joke character whose actually amazing.
[1:33:53] <+allastor21> Raiden
[1:33:55] <Equirah> butthole tricks?
[1:33:58] <KatyParry_FGC> for some reason you can link close st.D with df.A if you time the df.A correctly (a bit late)
[1:33:58] <%HungryHungryEmu> unlike the twitter tags
[1:33:59] <leith_aziz> So basically, I can do the move, but linking it at the right time rewards you more
[1:34:01] <+RichardMF_> no negative edge but theres button holding for specials only
[1:34:03] <%TopTieramisu> 98 shingo. never forget
[1:34:07] <this_guy_115> Shingo is STRONGER THAN DAN
[1:34:09] <KatyParry_FGC> Button Hold trick DOES exist in XIII but i dont use it so i cant teach it
[1:34:09] <fernanda_ps2> look up juicebox vid on the button hold trick it's very real
[1:34:11] <lonosi55> Anyone else mute the stream cause they know they not missing anything?
[1:34:12] <+thedream_c> @HungryHungryEmu learning KOF is more about how proficient you are with the system.
[1:34:17] <andre11dr> Oh man, i really hope they bring Shingo back, he's so cool
[1:34:21] <+allastor21> Raiden is a negative edge edge
[1:34:22] <%BusterRepukken> I wanna put in KOF 98 into my Neo Geo rn, so good.
[1:34:27] <KatyParry_FGC> Juicebox made a vid about Button Hold Trick in 13
[1:34:33] <HeavyNorse> @WoolieVersus Mouse cursor is in the middle of the screen.
[1:34:42] <+thedream_c> because what use are combos in KOF if you can't confirm?
[1:34:44] <CalderGaming> @lonosi55 why are you still here lol
[1:34:55] <+thedream_c> andwhatmakes KOF crazy is the system movmeent. U can run and have 4 types of hops
[1:34:55] <this_guy_115> KoF fun fact: Shingo since his reveal has been voiced by the actor for Dio Brando
[1:35:07] <%TopTieramisu> yo
[1:35:10] <%BusterRepukken> you got hops, short hops, rolling
[1:35:11] <%TopTieramisu> that guy has range
[1:35:13] <Grimsever88> @CalderGaming fr
[1:35:13] <alphalejandro> Like, in lore, Shingo becomes strong enough to become part of the Japan team in KOF2001
[1:35:13] <%BusterRepukken> lots of movement options
[1:35:14] <+thedream_c> soem chars like Mian and Choi Bounge kinda flot and and they suck
[1:35:17] <Revzero25> That’s sick
[1:35:19] <leith_aziz> @this_guy_115 SO we have him AND Zato in GG
[1:35:26] <+thedream_c> best part about KOF grapplers is... they don' tplay by grappler rules
[1:35:31] <fernanda_ps2> shingo is in japan team 03 as well
[1:35:33] <lonosi55> Salty peeps in the chat sugoiBestgirl
[1:35:35] <%BusterRepukken> in KOF, grapplers are actually good.
[1:35:36] <%TopTieramisu> i wonder what happened to kyo's original VA
[1:35:43] <+thedream_c> which is why if you play grapplers in KOF, you have a more dangerous mentality
[1:35:46] <this_guy_115> KoF grapplers are NASTY, especially the semi-grapplers
[1:35:52] <%HungryHungryEmu> is kof 13 on pc?
[1:35:54] <+thedream_c> Iori scum gale resets :p
[1:35:57] <+thedream_c> yes KOF13 is on pc
[1:35:57] <KatyParry_FGC> yes @HungryHungryEmu
[1:35:59] <%gatorafan> @leith_aziz yeah but you can hear the Dio in Zato, Shingo is a totally different beast
[1:35:59] <+thedream_c> get it cheap
[1:36:00] <dds333a> @busterrepukken Beast, even, and they're varied too
[1:36:02] <andre11dr> Wait Shingo is voiced by Takehiro Koyasu? i didn't know that
[1:36:04] <tacostarvedbeast> those are some beefy bois
[1:36:04] <fernanda_ps2> its the best version @hungryhungryemu
[1:36:05] <Man_in_the_Red> @hungryhungryemu 5 bucks on Fanatical too
[1:36:14] <KatyParry_FGC> KOF 13 steam edition is currently on sale @ fanatical
[1:36:15] <%HungryHungryEmu> lit
[1:36:16] <%BusterRepukken> @dds333a thats why current Zangief makes me cry.
[1:36:19] <KatyParry_FGC> what my guy @Man_in_the_Red said
[1:36:23] <eriksdrums> Generally new to fighting games: What is Woolie trying to learn/do right now?
[1:36:24] <alphalejandro> @fernanda_ps2 Yeah and also was the 3rd man in the Kyo Iori team in XI
[1:36:28] <+thedream_c> 98 Goro Daimon is a beast grappler
[1:36:33] <this_guy_115> Another fun fact is that Nameless from 02 UM is voiced by none other than Jotaro Kujo
[1:36:35] <leith_aziz> I hear alot of actors got replaced after KOF XIV. Are people ok with the new voices ?
[1:36:36] <fernanda_ps2> @eriksdrums basic important combos
[1:36:39] <Revzero25> Chat, who is your favorite kof protagonist?
[1:36:44] <%BusterRepukken> Kyo.
[1:36:44] <+thedream_c> 98 Goro not ONLY had cmd grabs, but GDLK normals to stop people from coming in
[1:36:45] <leith_aziz> Terry
[1:36:49] <fernanda_ps2> k' free
[1:36:49] <alphalejandro> @Revzero25 K'
[1:36:53] <leith_aziz> Also K'
[1:36:55] <this_guy_115> The only new actor I dislike is Iori
[1:36:55] <Man_in_the_Red> Shun ei Kappa
[1:36:55] <eriksdrums> @fernanda_ps2 Gotcha! Those would be bread-and-butter combos?
[1:36:58] <leith_aziz> He's cool too
[1:36:58] <%TopTieramisu> my favorite VA tidbit was KUSANAGI and K9999 were voiced by the voices of kaneda and tetsuo
[1:37:00] <KatyParry_FGC> cr.B cr.A that feels useless since cr.B to st.C exists
[1:37:04] <+thedream_c> K' in Vanila KOF14 was.... OOO WEEEE super optimized
[1:37:04] <%TopTieramisu> in 02
[1:37:04] <stormhawk9891> K'yo
[1:37:05] <fernanda_ps2> yes @eriksdrums
[1:37:06] <andre11dr> Clarke is a godlike grappler in this
[1:37:10] <tacostarvedbeast> is mr karate a protagonist?
[1:37:10] <this_guy_115> if you don't nail the Iori laugh, you don't deserve to voice Iori
[1:37:12] <%BusterRepukken> I own KOF 95/96/97 and 98 on original cartridge so I'm biased to the Kyo gang.
[1:37:12] <eriksdrums> @fernanda_ps2 Thanks!
[1:37:19] <dds333a> @leith_aziz mostly, but I will stand by Mayumi Shintani Ángel til the day i die
[1:37:19] <%X2Eliah> Insanity is the act of doing the same thing and expecting a different outcome.
[1:37:19] <+thedream_c> oh yeah Clarke was played by ET in KOF14 EVO grand fianls
[1:37:22] <%HungryHungryEmu> HungryHungryEmu subscribed with Prime.
[1:37:45] <leith_aziz> @dds333a She voices Giovanna now in Strive right ?
[1:37:49] <Revzero25> @alphalejandro K is so sick, but his play style always gets me
[1:38:05] <lonosi55> They couldve done the trials in the game but nah they had to do something more boring instead
[1:38:13] <+thedream_c> K' def tests your confirms and ccombo ability
[1:38:14] <%jepupu> KOF games always seemed to have really tight timing on combos
[1:38:16] <%TopTieramisu> i miss angel's original voice
[1:38:22] <%TopTieramisu> it's just not the same without her
[1:38:29] <+BusterRepukken> @lonosi55 are you just here to be a dick
[1:38:30] <alphalejandro> I don't like Kyo that much because he have this thing of disappear leaving his friends behind
[1:38:30] <%TopTieramisu> haruhara haruko
[1:38:30] <dds333a> @jepupu Pretty much
[1:38:37] <Grimsever88> @lonosi55 stay salty
[1:38:42] <%HungryHungryEmu> crazy how this game doesnt have roll back
[1:38:43] <CalderGaming> are there any mods in chat?
[1:38:44] <+thedream_c> the more crazy combos in KOF def involve tighter timings and small movement
[1:39:02] <@Menitta> no
[1:39:08] <KatyParry_FGC> it depends on the person
[1:39:09] <dds333a> @leith_aziz ye, she is
[1:39:09] <%Jiggisnipe> @lonosi55 you're a funny guy. constant string of complaints lol
[1:39:13] <%BusterRepukken> KOFs rep of 'being hard' when its not really as hard as any other game.
[1:39:15] <leith_aziz> We shouldnt need to have Mods
[1:39:15] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1369188817492656132?s=19
[1:39:17] <%mtlsars> theres characters that are much mroe time consuming than others
[1:39:19] <leith_aziz> Just calm down chat
[1:39:23] <CalderGaming> @Menitta lol thx
[1:39:24] <andre11dr> You know my favorite thing about KOF? Kyo and Iori are always toptier
[1:39:27] <leith_aziz> Lets not go there
[1:39:32] <%mtlsars> like if you decide to play Chin or Duo Long , you commit to that
[1:39:42] <@Menitta> What happened, I had to step away
[1:39:50] <%gatorafan> MONTH-LONG STREAM LETS GOOOOO PogChamp
[1:39:51] <@Menitta> Salty in chat? Chill. Please
[1:39:52] <CalderGaming> just wondering
[1:39:52] <%mtlsars> you can pick King or Mai or Km in your team to make up for it , they dont need as much training mode per se
[1:40:01] <dds333a> it's not exactly that kof is "hard", but it's a more kinetic, precise, fighter with multiple jumps for approach, and rolling and whatnot
[1:40:03] <andre11dr> Kof is the one franchise where MCs are always gods tier wise
[1:40:07] <Man_in_the_Red> Ash Crimson, put in hundreds of hours for your TOD, gets killed by 5 dollar Iori in a half second
[1:40:09] <leith_aziz> @Menitta I dont know. I just saw someone complain that Woolie wasnt doing the trials right now
[1:40:22] <%gatorafan> @andre11dr Shun took a while, but he got there
[1:40:24] <andre11dr> Even K was amazing in 99 and 02
[1:40:29] <+thedream_c> thats your fault for putting in long hours for a not so strong char :p
[1:40:34] <%TopTieramisu> is k' no longer great?
[1:40:38] <%jinking79> then u add short hops into combos later
[1:40:49] <Man_in_the_Red> not as busted as 2002 but K's good
[1:40:50] <%BusterRepukken> @dds333a true, Im just saying you dont need OPTIMIZED TOD COMBOS COMBO MAD to have fun like some people think you do.
[1:40:55] <this_guy_115> He's always good in every game, he's one of the fee charaxters that don't actually change
[1:40:59] <KatyParry_FGC> near the corner. cr.B st.C qcf.C cr.C b-f.C qcb.C into kick super
[1:41:12] <dds333a> @busterrepukken absolutely correct
[1:41:19] <andre11dr> @toptieramisu His really good in XIII and 14 but he was A GOD in 02
[1:41:23] <leith_aziz> If I would ever give KOF a shot, is K' dash complicated to get the basics down compared to the rest of the cast ?
[1:41:34] <leith_aziz> Ignore the "dash" word
[1:41:36] <%TopTieramisu> k' isn't that complex imo
[1:41:39] <this_guy_115> He's actually one of the simpler ones to use
[1:41:40] <KatyParry_FGC> @leith_aziz nooot really, no
[1:41:48] <leith_aziz> ah, I see
[1:41:52] <@Menitta> K` isnt too complicated
[1:41:52] <KatyParry_FGC> you can learn the KOF basics with K'
[1:42:03] <@Menitta> The most complicated character in KOF is probably Angel
[1:42:04] <Grimsever88> imagine watching a woolievs KOFXIII stream for the gameplay LUL Kappa
[1:42:10] <dds333a> Billy, Kim, and K' were all ridiculous in OG 02, then gain Kim is almost always good
[1:42:11] <KatyParry_FGC> if anyone in chat would like to learn what KOF is about, please watch the Dandy J Tutorial 2021 on YT
[1:42:14] <KatyParry_FGC> KOF Bible it is
[1:42:17] <%BusterRepukken> K' is a good start.
[1:42:18] <MonsieurHonHon> I played some KOF once on fightcade, it was ok but theres a lot of stuff going on in the ccharacter slecet screen so its hard to pick imo
[1:42:19] <Man_in_the_Red> gameplan's straight forward but theres a LOT if you want to use max mode effective
[1:42:19] <leith_aziz> No i mean, I would go with K', but I also wanna understand what I need to do
[1:42:31] <leith_aziz> Seems like a non issue acording to chat
[1:42:43] <CalderGaming> I remember having to make a flowchart for Angel's combo system for my own benefit
[1:42:58] <@Menitta> I can't give advice because i go into KOF like "this is like Street Fighter"
[1:43:01] <@Menitta> lol
[1:43:03] <%TopTieramisu> learning angel would break my brain i think
[1:43:04] <Revzero25> I’ve never played angel, what makes her so hard?
[1:43:19] <+Mordexai0> @revzero25 Inputs
[1:43:20] <KatyParry_FGC> @Menitta thats how most new players address KOF in the beginning
[1:43:21] <%TopTieramisu> she's like the ultimate rekka character with so many followups
[1:43:23] <this_guy_115> Angel uses links instead of normal special moves
[1:43:25] <+RichardMF_> @revzero25 she has her own unique combo system
[1:43:27] <MonsieurHonHon> @Menitta Isnt KOF just like SF on crack?
[1:43:29] <dds333a> @revzero25 she's an absolutely fucking crazy link character
[1:43:30] <%BusterRepukken> imagine if Max's prediction comes true and KOF 15 gets a street fighter team
[1:43:30] <%wibbwobbler> lookin pretty good
[1:43:38] <KatyParry_FGC> KOF is like SF with a biiit more freedom
[1:43:43] <alphalejandro> Angel moveset is kinda wack
[1:43:43] <this_guy_115> She has a total of like, 3 input moves with the rest being links
[1:43:45] <KatyParry_FGC> you have 4 jumps
[1:43:48] <dds333a> Unchain circle is her own unique system
[1:43:49] <Grimsever88> @BusterRepukken that'd be pretty hype actually
[1:43:53] <leith_aziz> Music is great atleast
[1:44:00] <KatyParry_FGC> you can move if ya wanna. but KOF isnt as free as a marvel
[1:44:02] <andre11dr> Yeah Angel is like the ultimate execution caracter she's like the Lee of KOF
[1:44:12] <%Jetzord> sup guys, how's the labbing going?
[1:44:12] <leith_aziz> Hey, guests bring in people, so Im never against it
[1:44:13] <Revzero25> Yeesh, she sounds.... difficult
[1:44:15] <+Mordexai0> @busterrepukken He said team guest. One person from FEXL, one from Tekken, one from SF. Not an entire SF Team.
[1:44:17] <leith_aziz> Im all for it
[1:44:21] <%TopTieramisu> it's hard to compare movements with a game that has air movement
[1:44:21] <+NarcissistCactus> personaentertainment combo videos were sick
[1:44:24] <$pluckrabbit> who said Angel is wack, who is that person
[1:44:31] <this_guy_115> She IS difficult but VERY fun if you can master her
[1:44:32] <@Menitta> Angel is wack
[1:44:34] <leith_aziz> Even GG can try a guest. Maybe Dante ?
[1:44:35] <MonsieurHonHon> So i got here a bit late, whats he labbing?
[1:44:38] <leith_aziz> Would be sick
[1:44:38] <%TopTieramisu> air movement that's as free form as marvel, that is
[1:44:41] <%BusterRepukken> @Mordexai0 yeah thats a little too out there for me, i could see a full SF team but not all that.
[1:44:41] <this_guy_115> or at least, UNDERSTAND her moveset
[1:44:43] <$pluckrabbit> Menittaaaaaaaaaaa
[1:44:49] <andre11dr> Angel is definitely VERY TOP TIER in 02 UM
[1:44:52] <dds333a> I have Ángel's ACHOO burned into my brain
[1:45:01] <%TopTieramisu> yoisho
[1:45:11] <this_guy_115> Wanna know a top tier Angel combo?
[1:45:13] <KatyParry_FGC> near the corner. cr.B st.C qcf.C cr.C b-f.C qcb.C into kick super
[1:45:14] <%gatorafan> Angel's theme on 2k2UM is top tier. SourPls
[1:45:18] <this_guy_115> kickkickkickkickkick
[1:45:28] <this_guy_115> SeemsGood
[1:45:39] <leith_aziz> So is music in KOF stage based or character based like in GG and SF ?
[1:45:39] <CalderGaming> I always heard it as "ARCHER" but I'm sure that's not what she's actually saying
[1:45:45] <$pluckrabbit> next you'll say something wrong like Athena is bad or something
[1:45:48] <Revzero25> Now I’m curious
[1:45:49] <andre11dr> Also SNK for fucks sakes bring Rugal back
[1:45:49] <+Mordexai0> @busterrepukken A FEXL character makes sense because SNK initially helped with Arika's Netcode and they have a working relationship, Skullo in Heroines, Terry in FEXL. So a FEXL character isn't out there.
[1:46:04] <this_guy_115> KoF themes are based on Player 2's initial character
[1:46:06] <+RichardMF_> @leith_aziz its team based
[1:46:06] <%TopTieramisu> bring adelheid back
[1:46:10] <@Menitta> I miss Rugal's original design
[1:46:11] <%TopTieramisu> his design was so slick
[1:46:17] <CalderGaming> I have had Athena on my team though I totally understand people who don't like her voice
[1:46:17] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:46:22] <%BusterRepukken> @leith_aziz team based or player 2, i think you can change that stuff in the options.
[1:46:23] <dds333a> @andre11dr you're gonna get Adelheid, and you're gonna like it
[1:46:23] <leith_aziz> @RichardMF_ thanks
[1:46:28] <+Mordexai0> @andre11dr At least bring his Son back. Dude deserves more than one game.
[1:46:29] <this_guy_115> Omega Rugal is overrated, 02 Rugal is the REAL SHIT
[1:46:31] <OblivionSword1> Rugal with the suit is super slick
[1:46:38] <alphalejandro> Rugal may be back, along with many of the antagonist because of Verse
[1:46:43] <%TopTieramisu> rugal's been resurrected too many times. he'll be bio broly if he keeps getting resurrected
[1:46:45] <%BusterRepukken> genocide CUTT AH
[1:46:46] <this_guy_115> Pale rugal with blonde hard and BLOOD pants
[1:46:51] <DDDorsett> 02 Rugal is Omega Rugal LUL
[1:46:54] <$pluckrabbit> wonder if Orochi will come back
[1:46:54] <Revzero25> Goenitz?
[1:46:57] <CalderGaming> goo rugal. googal.
[1:47:00] <this_guy_115> Yeah but better looking
[1:47:02] <lonosi55> Rugal will be back according to the leak
[1:47:02] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Mordexai0
[1:47:03] <KatyParry_FGC> goetnitz is cool, just not to fight
[1:47:11] <leith_aziz> Rugal has like 2 looks right ? I prefer the one with the suit
[1:47:12] <andre11dr> No fuck Adel ,I need my dumb Panther Milion Dollar Man looking motherfucker
[1:47:13] <+vaporousTippler> 94/95 Rugal is the most busted, if you're talking AI.
[1:47:16] <%BusterRepukken> Orochi came back in 14, in Kyo's team's ending. Idk if thats canon though.
[1:47:20] <this_guy_115> also 02 gave him aNOTHER cuttermove that can COMBO INTO the cutter!
[1:47:25] <+Mordexai0> Lol Imagine if Verse Brought Back K9999
[1:47:26] <deafmelone> What if Rugal came back with Mature and Vice as a team?
[1:47:29] <dds333a> @oblivionsword1 Evening wear Rugal is my favourite too, but his beads destruction from '02 is beautiful
[1:47:35] <%TopTieramisu> zero's cape fighting style is so slick. too bad he's such a nothing character
[1:47:38] <Revzero25> I always loved the idea of Goenitz and his impact on kyo as a character
[1:47:55] <+Mordexai0> @busterrepukken It's canon to an extent, so Chris is never comin back
[1:48:00] <dds333a> Reggie with the CHOU UPPER
[1:48:04] <this_guy_115> KOF LORE: Ash's actions at the end of 13 caused a time paradox that not only created the big bad of 14, but also REVIVED most if not all previously dead characters
[1:48:05] <%BusterRepukken> @Mordexai0 thats fine, fuck them kids
[1:48:13] <andre11dr> I would also take Igniz if they made him fair
[1:48:15] <leith_aziz> Would a Rugal team work with his son and someone else ? I dont know if they're on equal terms
[1:48:18] <+NarcissistCactus> good taste
[1:48:27] <%EXVulgar> one of the best fighting games
[1:48:29] <%TopTieramisu> @this_guy_115 so... ash did a goof
[1:48:38] <this_guy_115> Yes
[1:48:40] <%mtlsars> mtlsars subscribed with Prime.
[1:48:42] <%BusterRepukken> There's a great channel for KOF lore called ShoryuGame
[1:48:45] <%EXVulgar> these sprites are sick
[1:48:51] <+Mordexai0> Ash was hot in MIRA
[1:48:52] <alphalejandro> Rugal, Goenitz, Shermie and Yashiro, Krizalid, Clone Zero, Zero, Igniz, Mukai, the pink dood of XI, and white Ash from the past, all of the them can maybe return, again because Verse
[1:48:53] <leith_aziz> Repeat ? I didnt listen sorry
[1:48:56] <%EXVulgar> EXVulgar subscribed at Tier 1.
[1:48:57] <KatyParry_FGC> GOD NO THE WHITE STAGE
[1:49:06] <leith_aziz> OH NO THIS STAGE !
[1:49:08] <stanlychicken> That's a really good Ash color
[1:49:09] <teeb15> YEAH WHITE STAGE
[1:49:11] <KatyParry_FGC> cover your eyes chat
[1:49:11] <%gatorafan> Ahh yes, the eye bleed stage
[1:49:12] <@Menitta> I dont get the hatred towards Ash. He's cool
[1:49:14] <deafmelone> Shoryugame is legit
[1:49:14] <convo445> light mode activated
[1:49:19] <%TopTieramisu> was never a fan of ash crimson, narratively. but he's goddamn terry bogard compared shun'ei
[1:49:21] <leith_aziz> Yuri's face. What the hell...
[1:49:24] <ManaSpurt> Holy shit Yuri's cranium is fucking HUGE.
[1:49:29] <%TopTieramisu> compared to*
[1:49:29] <this_guy_115> The CONFIRMED revived characters are the New Face Team(Orochi team), Krizalid, Leona's dad, Rugal, and Igniz
[1:49:30] <dds333a> @leith_aziz I bet Rugal actually loved his kids, and spoiled them and everything but Adelheid isnt evil
[1:49:32] <andre11dr> I would be cool if they made Rose playable
[1:49:35] <+Mordexai0> The Power Of A New Generation
[1:49:39] <KatyParry_FGC> Yuri has somehow got a football stuck in her mouth
[1:49:44] <%BusterRepukken> i like Ash to an extent, Shunei is the first MC I dont like much.
[1:49:45] <ponteronten> Ash's theme in 13 was real good
[1:49:46] <+RedRibbonRick> this stage would legit blind you with hdr on
[1:49:49] <Grimsever88> yuri with the jrpg chibi head
[1:49:52] <ManaSpurt> Yuri looks like she has a fucking kirby with a wig on her head.lmao
[1:49:55] <CalderGaming> I think that's her hair poofing, partially
[1:49:55] <leith_aziz> @dds333a Yeah I know his son is super nice and is trying to protect his sister
[1:49:57] <dds333a> Yuri with the bowlcut
[1:49:58] <+HolyGriddles> Yeah, Yuri’s nose seems non-existent with this sprite
[1:50:07] <Revzero25> Shun ei has some intrestinh stuff going on with his devil bringer
[1:50:13] <lonosi55> I wont be buying Kof xv if ash doesnt make it back
[1:50:22] <%TopTieramisu> i mostly hate shun'ei's look
[1:50:22] <%wibbwobbler> ash huh
[1:50:26] <alphalejandro> Ash was "revived" by Kukri in XIV
[1:50:26] <%TopTieramisu> too many god damn colors
[1:50:29] <%BusterRepukken> yeah his look is all over the place
[1:50:31] <@Solidus_113> everyone likes Yuri Kappa
[1:50:31] <joshua_42> He has a bad design
[1:50:33] <leith_aziz> Shunei has cool powers. I just think his look is stupid
[1:50:34] <CalderGaming> Yuri is Akuma Deluxe
[1:50:35] <andre11dr> Ash was the first MC where i was like, no tank you Falcon
[1:50:37] <dds333a> Kyokugenry prodigy
[1:50:40] <%TopTieramisu> yuri even has shun goku satsu
[1:50:46] <Revzero25> I like aspects of his design
[1:50:47] <%BusterRepukken> they showed off Shuneis beta outfit from 14 and he looks alot more consistent at least.
[1:50:48] <dds333a> *kyokugenryu
[1:50:48] <+Mordexai0> Also SNK Heroines version of Kukri is non Canon.
[1:50:58] <this_guy_115> KOF LORE: Adelheid inherited Rugal's strength but not his personality, whereas his stister Rose inherited his mannerisms and is the fencer version of her dad
[1:50:59] <andre11dr> Yuri is awesome
[1:51:03] <dds333a> demon flip, and everything
[1:51:06] <KatyParry_FGC> Yuri is KOF's akuma
[1:51:07] <+Shmario> she even had a ragint demon on kof 2001
[1:51:12] <+Shmario> raging demon *
[1:51:24] <deafmelone> She even has Ryu's Joudan
[1:51:24] <Revzero25> Hard to believe that the people who designed rock made shun ei tho
[1:51:26] <andre11dr> Imagine Garou 2 with midlife crisis Yuri!
[1:51:29] <%BusterRepukken> Yuri is KOF's Taskmaster. Anything she sees, she can perform herself.
[1:51:35] <alphalejandro> @this_guy_115 Both Adelheid and Rock are basically Giorno from JoJo
[1:51:36] <%LordSDB> My fav track is from KoF 13 is Each Promise woolieGASM
[1:51:52] <%TopTieramisu> i love that the lore reason in the kof manga is that yuri is a genius that can learn a move after seeing it the first time

[1:51:59] <+xerotwo> some may argue she has more moves than Sakura lol
[1:52:09] <this_guy_115> Yuri is the shoto freak version of Dan, lore-wise she learned EVERY shoto move in a single year
[1:52:12] <%BusterRepukken> b ut if Yuri doesn't get good results the first time she uses a new move, she drops the move forever.
[1:52:14] <leith_aziz> @alphalejandro: Wow. I cant unsee Rock as Giorno now. AND They're both Blond
[1:52:19] <leith_aziz> Blonde
[1:52:28] <%BusterRepukken> so Yuri is every fighting game player ever
[1:52:33] <alphalejandro> @leith_aziz Adel is also blond i think
[1:53:00] <%TopTieramisu> @leith_aziz yeah, but rock's power is understandable
[1:53:07] <+HolyGriddles> Yuri in 15 looks great
[1:53:09] <leith_aziz> @alphalejandro: Yes, but personality wise, I dont think he fits as well
[1:53:12] <this_guy_115> Yes, Adel is sick, he has a similar look to tanktop Rugal but he nails it mich better than his dad imo
[1:53:13] <andre11dr> I wish they would age Yuri up
[1:53:21] <%TopTieramisu> gold experience is the most poorly defined stand ability in part 5 by far
[1:53:22] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:53:36] <OblivionSword1> XV Yuri is very cute
[1:53:48] <this_guy_115> Axelheid also reppukens with his FOOT, that's how strong he is
[1:53:51] <%TopTieramisu> the girls' arms in kof 13 are too thin
[1:53:51] <dds333a> @this_guy_115 it the suspenders
[1:53:51] <leith_aziz> I just think GE is too good for its own good
[1:54:10] <andre11dr> I just want to see what god among men Yuri is at 30 is she keeps training
[1:54:14] <dds333a> @toptieramisu it mostly works
[1:54:20] <alphalejandro> But the idea is there, both Rock and Adel are sons of antagonist and they are tecnically good guys, just like Giorno
[1:54:20] <%wibbwobbler> pretty great upper cut coming from yuri imo
[1:54:24] <%TopTieramisu> @dds333a giorno vs bruno
[1:54:33] <%TopTieramisu> also giorno vs koichi
[1:54:52] <CalderGaming> @wibbwobbler would you say its, a... Chou Upper?
[1:54:57] <%TopTieramisu> none of those abilities are present in gold experience later on
[1:54:58] <leith_aziz> I didnt mind Giorno too much since Bruno was right there, and he was MUCH more interesting and likeable
[1:55:19] <leith_aziz> I love Bruno
[1:55:20] <+RichardMF_> super cancels from specials cost HD
[1:55:21] <andre11dr> I wish Adel got more, his design is kinda meh
[1:55:23] <%TopTieramisu> bruno is fantastic
[1:55:31] <KatyParry_FGC> special into super, 1 bar 1 drive
[1:55:36] <%TopTieramisu> all of the crew outside of giorno were great
[1:55:49] <andre11dr> Also yes Bruno is the best thing in Part 5 to me
[1:56:03] <this_guy_115> I think his design was fine but for someone considered to be the SECOND PROTAGONIST in the Ash arc he was only present for TWO games
[1:56:06] <%TopTieramisu> it was technically their story in a way. them fighting fate to create a bright future for someone outside of themsleves (giorno)
[1:56:16] <dds333a> @toptieramisu the only thing that gets dropped is damage reflection, the application of GE's power on people is different. it also works differently on stands as evidenced by black sabbath, and there's very few opportunities where Giorno was directly hitting an opponent where it wasn't the final blow later
[1:56:44] <andre11dr> I think he gets the best fights and he's caracter is so much more well defined than Giorno
[1:57:05] <this_guy_115> Yes, there were no more chances for the soul punch ability to happen since he only ever either landed the killing blow or punched the stand
[1:57:13] <deafmelone> Adelheid deserves bettter,considering he's the son of the series main villain.
[1:57:18] <andre11dr> Also Sticky Fingers is my favorite stand of the party too so that helps
[1:57:23] <leith_aziz> @TopTieramisu Part 5 is not among my favorites (Part 2/4) but that team puts it so higjh
[1:57:28] <%TopTieramisu> it's also very disappointing that the offspring of dio and jonathan is that boring
[1:57:36] <this_guy_115> No he's the poster villain but not the main one anymore
[1:57:54] <dds333a> @this_guy_115 yeah.
[1:57:56] <%TopTieramisu> the stand battles are fantastic in part 5
[1:58:01] <leith_aziz> @TopTieramisu I think you should see Giorno as his own person, as thats what Giorno tries so hard to do
[1:58:01] <andre11dr> @leith_aziz 7 tho BibleThump
[1:58:18] <dds333a> Although rugal is far and away the most popular kof antagonist
[1:58:24] <%TopTieramisu> @leith_aziz he's just less interesting than the other jojo protagonists
[1:58:37] <leith_aziz> @andre11dr Im not there yet, but I know some memes and Mister "Dojjjiaaaaaaan" himslef
[1:58:42] <leith_aziz> Himself
[1:58:44] <deafmelone> still he should been in more than two games
[1:58:45] <%TopTieramisu> the most interesting thing about him is he doesn't hesitate to kill
[1:58:45] <alphalejandro> I will not call Rugal the main villian of KOF, like he was the final boss in only 2 "lore games" (KOF'94 and '95)
[1:58:57] <andre11dr> Ok well just know that 7 is the best one
[1:59:06] <Revzero25> ^
[1:59:29] <andre11dr> And i don't know anything about 8
[1:59:30] <Revzero25> Johnny is best jojo
[1:59:30] <leith_aziz> @TopTieramisu Yeah, he's probably my least favorite protag. I liked Jonathan's strive to be a nice person. I can relate
[1:59:43] <%TopTieramisu> i like jonathan because part 1 was so campy
[1:59:43] <dds333a> Into that Hien Houo Kyaku
[1:59:50] <andre11dr> I'll read 8 when it's done in 3 years
[2:00:06] <Man_in_the_Red> you mean in 10 years
[2:00:08] <leith_aziz> Is Part 8 like really long or something ?
[2:00:10] <CalderGaming> that reminds me we're getting a Thus Spake Rohan Kishibe anime
[2:00:20] <leith_aziz> Ive not checked the manga
[2:00:26] <dds333a> @leith_aziz longest running Part so far
[2:00:26] <%TopTieramisu> and jonathan was like some super exaggerated shounenified personification of chivalry and nobility
[2:00:27] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:00:36] <this_guy_115> That's old news, there's 4 made already
[2:00:37] <%gatorafan> part 8 is not only long, it's also monthly.
[2:00:42] <%gatorafan> So it takes a minute.
[2:00:52] <%mtlsars> Kim trials , cmon Reggie , join the dark side
[2:00:59] <leith_aziz> @gatorafan Thats better than rushing the work, so good job on them
[2:01:01] <%TopTieramisu> araki deserves towork at a slower pace at this point
[2:01:04] <+smacksfenton> What's the word on the SNK-Saudi Arabia stuff chat? Would really like to be able to look forward to this game lol
[2:01:16] <dds333a> @toptieramisu and also grounded in a few ways, mainly in his relationship with Dio Brando
[2:01:17] <this_guy_115> YEAH this theme and Iori's team are the ONLY themes I like from 13
[2:01:18] <%TopTieramisu> and he's not miura or togashi
[2:01:20] <KatyParry_FGC> Akutema
[2:01:20] <+smacksfenton> well, not this game, you know what I mean
[2:01:27] <%gatorafan> That air grab is so cool.
[2:01:29] <andre11dr> If Kim is the dark side Mr Karate is like Darth Nihilus
[2:01:30] <+FuqBoiSlim> Steel ball ran from like 2003-04 to 2011 and jojolion started in 2011 and is still going. We're in it for the long haul
[2:01:32] <KatyParry_FGC> @this_guy_115 no love for London March?
[2:01:44] <%TopTieramisu> PSYCHO BALLLLLL
[2:01:45] <@Menitta> wait
[2:01:46] <Afrosamasenpai> reggie no
[2:01:48] <stormhawk9891> Uhhhhhhh......
[2:01:49] <@Menitta> Reggie....
[2:01:50] <+Suneater_Jerome> Reggie chill
[2:01:50] <+FuqBoiSlim> SAIKO BALL
[2:01:51] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @InXplotch
[2:01:51] <%Mrthefro> woolieKICKDAD
[2:01:51] <OldManDeckardCain> reggie, not again
[2:01:52] <TheVoltStrike> does he like Jam as well?
[2:01:54] <mike_rowave> freaky
[2:01:56] <this_guy_115> Arranged > 14 > 13's london march
[2:01:57] <+Ultimate_Edge> So he likes Jam too
[2:01:58] <%mtlsars> MvC2 Storm is your favorite then
[2:01:58] <dds333a> reggie monkaS
[2:01:59] <%gatorafan> @katyparry_fgc, London March XIII? Ehhhhh the original is so much better.
[2:02:00] <Grimsever88> screams and feet
[2:02:04] <Pookiedaexzile> Not so Innocent reggie
[2:02:05] <InXplotch> Reggie first the feet, now the screaming
[2:02:08] <powerprotoman> so feet and screamers is reggies type
[2:02:08] <leith_aziz> Again, I never played a KOF, so this doesnt matter as much to me (as a decision since I have no issue doing the right thing with something I have no affiliation to)
[2:02:14] <KatyParry_FGC> @gatorafan whaaaat? im hurt
[2:02:18] <Zero_kirby> yo
[2:02:18] <Pookiedaexzile> Women Woolie
[2:02:22] <%gatorafan> XIV London March is cool too
[2:02:24] <%LastHazzerd> that's part of her attack
[2:02:31] <OldManDeckardCain> woolie: reggie, do you like children? LUL
[2:02:31] <%LastHazzerd> the shrieking
[2:02:33] <Gutsandlove> nah, we need more screamlords and screamgirls
[2:02:35] <dds333a> PSYCHO BALLLL is so grating
[2:02:36] <leith_aziz> Man, that buss is loaded
[2:02:37] <%TopTieramisu> oh god, jam
[2:02:38] <Pookiedaexzile> He said women
[2:02:40] <BlackermanZX> Reggie Lore update StinkyGlitch
[2:02:54] <unfunny_asian> I see, so Reggie’s favorite V-Tuber would be Uruha Rushia if he loves screams
[2:02:58] <alphalejandro> PSYCHO SWORDO!!!
[2:03:01] <leith_aziz> I dont mind them creaming, but just how often they scream
[2:03:01] <%TopTieramisu> jam definitely takes the annoying yells to an 11
[2:03:06] <leith_aziz> Screaming
[2:03:11] <%Mrthefro> Can we redact lore?
[2:03:12] <dds333a> PHOENIXSU ARROW
[2:03:15] <%TopTieramisu> @leith_aziz BOP
[2:03:17] <Afrosamasenpai> BUTT LOOPS
[2:03:17] <%mtlsars> Reggie Kelly
[2:03:18] <+MrAtheGreat> reggie likes screaming girls confrimed
[2:03:20] <%Akizea> jam isn't that bad imo
[2:03:22] <leith_aziz> Dammit, I messed it up
[2:03:22] <+Tochma> Fbi pulling up
[2:03:23] <Pookiedaexzile> Woolie tryin to throw this man under the Smash community bus
[2:03:26] <+FuqBoiSlim> CREAMING??? Yall are on something today huh
[2:03:29] <%wibbwobbler> yuri is based
[2:03:29] <Gutsandlove> true
[2:03:32] <KatyParry_FGC> Persona is our DESK
[2:03:33] <BlackermanZX> these combos are so goddamn dirty
[2:03:34] <Pookiedaexzile> reggie won't be had
[2:03:39] <DedlokPM> DedlokPM subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months! Come for the combos, stay for the HD Butt Cancels
[2:03:39] <stormhawk9891> CLIPPED
[2:03:40] <@Menitta> god I thought they were playing just now
[2:03:40] <leith_aziz> (I fucked up. I didnt mean that)
[2:03:42] <this_guy_115> Ok but now watch Iori's infinite video where he just Rekka's WITHOUT USING METER
[2:03:43] <stormhawk9891> https://clips.twitch.tv/ColorfulKitschyNostrilPlanking-lLRs5nK8FxcxL0Pl
[2:03:43] <Pookiedaexzile> LUL
[2:03:48] <whimsicallifestyle> yuri yells like mom said its her turn on the xbox
[2:03:58] <+FuqBoiSlim> @leith_aziz yeah..aight
[2:04:57] <leith_aziz> The music is great
[2:04:59] <alphalejandro> Like Yuri's like low key the best shoto ever
[2:05:23] <andre11dr> EX Kyo is the most brain dead HD in the game, it literally just mash on reca into reca
[2:05:33] <leith_aziz> To me, the most fun Shoto/main protag I've played in a FG is Sol
[2:05:39] <Man_in_the_Red> im more in favor of Akatsuki as best shoto but thats mostly because of Under Night's version
[2:05:50] <+Tochma> This game still looks good
[2:05:52] <fernanda_ps2> its a dp not a crouch C
[2:06:04] <%TopTieramisu> igniz is my favorite shoto :)
[2:06:08] <Grimsever88> @leith_aziz ah, a gorliia of culture i see.
[2:06:09] <KatyParry_FGC> this game would look better with scanlines
[2:06:10] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @leith_aziz which is funny because sol plays nothing like a shoto LUL
[2:06:13] <leith_aziz> Sol's a Shoto, but he has so many "screw nutral" moves, even in Strive
[2:06:29] <%gatorafan> Sol is a grappler Kappa
[2:06:33] <leith_aziz> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ I guess Ky is more of a shoto
[2:06:38] <this_guy_115> Oh man, Rekka kyo in this game is GREAT, because you can combo BOTH of his rekkas into each other
[2:07:00] <KatyParry_FGC> rekka kyo's chain LK's are the most fun hit confirms ever
[2:07:05] <KatyParry_FGC> st. BBBBBBB
[2:07:06] <+Ultimate_Edge> Kyo can do that in 2002UM. It's very satisfying
[2:07:19] <%TopTieramisu> kyo's dempsey roll
[2:07:33] <%Akizea> coast to coasts are so fucking sick
[2:07:33] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1369188817492656132?s=19
[2:07:35] <%TopTieramisu> just throw in some airplane effects
[2:07:39] <%TopTieramisu> sound effects*
[2:07:40] <leith_aziz> So when I saw Kyo in XV I just thoght that was his old look, but I think its a little different
[2:07:44] <dds333a> Aragami into Aragami
[2:07:49] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ yeah, somehow the secondary character, in contrast to the main one, is the most shoto to have ever walked the earth, guilty gear truly is special
[2:07:51] <andre11dr> Kyo and Iori get crazy shit with HD
[2:07:57] <this_guy_115> Its a mixture of his classic look and his Ash arc biker look
[2:08:03] <leith_aziz> Like I dont think old Kyo had sleeves with his jacket
[2:08:12] <%TopTieramisu> is it not alternating aragami into dokugami?
[2:08:22] <+Mrhennybottle> Nice
[2:08:23] <this_guy_115> personally I liked his NESTS jacket look but 14 left people wanting more from it
[2:08:26] <big_booty_animemilf> PogChamp KomodoHype
[2:08:27] <dds333a> Or, shit, maybe that was what it was
[2:08:32] <deafmelone> coool
[2:08:37] <Revzero25> I like joys new look it’s pretty stylish especially the headband
[2:08:38] <+FuqBoiSlim> Filia is prob my favorite shoto but a shoto I feel people overlook is what's his name from waku waku 7
[2:08:40] <+Ultimate_Edge> Just anything that wasn't the 14 model was all I asked for
[2:08:42] <%Josef_Stryker> I think it's the hair that makes KOF14 Kyo look weird
[2:08:42] <leith_aziz> I think his jacket in this game looks cool
[2:08:43] <Revzero25> *kyo
[2:08:49] <alphalejandro> My favorite Kyo is Nest Kyo (KOF'99, 2000 and 2001)
[2:08:52] <Limes528> You spen A LOT of meter in KOF
[2:08:53] <%TopTieramisu> kof14 has generic boyband hair
[2:08:54] <leith_aziz> Dont know whats my preference for Kyo
[2:08:56] <%Josef_Stryker> It just made him look like a really generic anime protag
[2:08:56] <deafmelone> Rai?
[2:08:57] <%TopTieramisu> and his eyes are lifeless
[2:08:57] <KatyParry_FGC> @Josef_Stryker you're right, cuz its a wig
[2:08:58] <@Menitta> I dont like Kyo's jacket in 14
[2:09:09] <%TopTieramisu> nests kyo is peak for me
[2:09:15] <+NarcissistCactus> ash atpCap
[2:09:18] <Revzero25> 2002 is best kyo tho
[2:09:21] <this_guy_115> Yeah NESTS kyo is best kyo (Not THIS nests kyo though, with the damn shoulderpads)
[2:09:22] <andre11dr> I really like 15 Kyo ,it's like 94 and XIII version mashed together
[2:09:25] <+Shmario> uh oh ash
[2:09:26] <InXplotch> King
[2:09:31] <this_guy_115> IORI
[2:09:32] <leith_aziz> Does XIV dress the same way as 13 ? Or is it a different look ?
[2:09:33] <%wibbwobbler> bust out these dang sprites snk
[2:09:33] <+FuqBoiSlim> High-school dropout era Kyo still best Kyo
[2:09:34] <@Menitta> I wanna cosplay NEST Kyo
[2:09:35] <+Mrhennybottle> ash... yeesh
[2:09:36] <dds333a> I found Kyo's hair fine XIV, but he overall looked awkward. '99 kyo is the best
[2:09:49] <this_guy_115> for XIV almost everyone got a new design
[2:09:50] <dds333a> The one that flies over the ground
[2:09:57] <KatyParry_FGC> @leith_aziz different looks
[2:10:10] <+Ultimate_Edge> 14 Kyo looks like a lean modeler and not the idiot bar brawler he is
[2:10:11] <andre11dr> But yo ,15 Iori look super sick
[2:10:11] <+Shmario> i SAW TAKUMA
[2:10:14] <+Shmario> is there
[2:10:17] <this_guy_115> Terry got his first non-garou jacket and Leona got a new tanktop and pants
[2:10:21] <+Shmario> go back u passed
[2:10:24] <this_guy_115> WATCH IORI
[2:10:24] <+LeonSteel> he passed takuma 3 times lol
[2:10:25] <%TopTieramisu> @dds333a the move that's like a truncated cammy's spinning back fist into an uppercut, right?
[2:10:40] <%TopTieramisu> i don't even know if you can call that an uppercut actually
[2:10:44] <+Grayhammatter> he's looking for ash
[2:10:45] <KatyParry_FGC> just type XIII persona ash
[2:10:50] <%TopTieramisu> it's like a rising gut punch
[2:10:50] <KatyParry_FGC> that should do the trick
[2:10:53] <+Shmario> DAMN
[2:10:54] <+Shmario> 4 times
[2:10:56] <OblivionSword1> Woolie you passed it again
[2:10:59] <KatyParry_FGC> ahhh LOL
[2:10:59] <+Shmario> it IS on the playlist
[2:11:02] <+LeonSteel> 4 times
[2:11:04] <leith_aziz> Kyo can look more stylish if he grows into it, but if he's the same character, then those looks dont work
[2:11:08] <InXplotch> El classico "navigate with mouse only"
[2:11:12] <%gatorafan> Ash being deleted from the playlist is canon Kappa
[2:11:13] <andre11dr> Clearly nobody likes Ash LUL
[2:11:35] <KatyParry_FGC> there is always that 1 ash vid that ppl like but it will not help you learn him
[2:11:35] <this_guy_115> reggie....
[2:11:36] <Jathspuh> FINAL monkaS
[2:11:43] <StormFourStrings> Haha you have more views than Pat. Get destroyed @theIrish
[2:11:44] <alphalejandro> Ash didn't die, he erase himself from history
[2:11:46] <Man_in_the_Red> people just dont like what Ash did to the sacred treasures
[2:11:47] <DomonTrigger> Deluxe Twink
[2:11:47] <dds333a> @toptieramisu the very same, but I was mentioning Hien Shipuu kyaku after Reggie mentioned, but I think you were right it was Aragami jnto Dokugami, my memory is failing me right now
[2:11:53] <+NarcissistCactus> this is a bread and butter
[2:11:56] <Revzero25> Was ash supposed to be the villain or not?
[2:11:59] <+Grayhammatter> oh my god
[2:12:07] <cj_art> christ
[2:12:08] <+Grayhammatter> that's wild
[2:12:09] <+Mrhennybottle> Ash is a hero but not your typical hero
[2:12:11] <dds333a> @revzero25 his ancestor anyway
[2:12:15] <+Tochma> Is kof a Good game for beginners
[2:12:17] <this_guy_115> Ash is bother the protag and a sort of SIDE villain of the Ash arc
[2:12:20] <Man_in_the_Red> @revzero25 he's a Poochy
[2:12:20] <this_guy_115> both*
[2:12:25] <%wibbwobbler> PowerUpL PowerUpR
[2:12:29] <leith_aziz> @Tochma Of fighting games ?
[2:12:35] <+Tochma> Yes
[2:12:37] <KatyParry_FGC> @Tochma for beginners meaning easy to understand? it depends on the specific KOF
[2:12:41] <dds333a> @man_in_the_red KEKW, exactly
[2:12:54] <leith_aziz> @Tochma Try Strive atleast
[2:12:54] <KatyParry_FGC> @Tochma i'd say KOF 14 is a good KOF for beginners
[2:12:55] <%TopTieramisu> when ash took iori's powers, i was sweating because i didn't want kyo to get schooled too
[2:12:59] <+Ultimate_Edge> What in the actual fuck is this combo
[2:13:09] <leith_aziz> I dont know about KOF as I've never played one
[2:13:12] <+Tochma> Thanks
[2:13:21] <Man_in_the_Red> a lot of Falcoon's characters are poochy
[2:13:24] <KatyParry_FGC> 14 is the most forgiving KOF to play n learn. but the good thing is most modern KOF's share the same basics so learning 1 will translate to another. @Tochma
[2:13:25] <+Mrhennybottle> 99 hits
[2:13:34] <Man_in_the_Red> so not saying much
[2:13:36] <leith_aziz> Weird combo
[2:13:40] <leith_aziz> ....
[2:13:40] <this_guy_115> KOF LORE: In order to beat the big bad of the ash arc, which was Ash's time traveling ancestor, he started stealing the three sacred treasures (Kyo Sword, Iori Yagatama, and Chizuru Mirror) in order to trick him
[2:13:43] <+Grayhammatter> the CARRIES
[2:13:44] <leith_aziz> ITS STILL GOING
[2:13:44] <dds333a> Setup swag
[2:13:46] <+Mordexai0> @man_in_the_red Yeah, didn't Sombrero Vergil die at the end of Maximum Impact?
[2:13:48] <@Menitta> what the fuck lmao
[2:13:49] <+DeaconBluesClues> I remember seeing a video where someone did this exact combo in a match, did 80% damage, and then on wakeup the iori did a much simpler ten hit combo that killed the ash in response
[2:13:50] <shenran14> @Tochma I think you would be good if you are beginner.
[2:13:50] <%gatorafan> SSS
[2:13:53] <leith_aziz> WTF ?
[2:13:54] <+Mrhennybottle> doodTerror Stop stop, shes already dead
[2:13:57] <leith_aziz> SSS
[2:13:58] <b_ikki> jogging
[2:13:58] <@Menitta> thats some bullshit
[2:13:58] <fallensiren270> THAT WAS SOME GOD SHIT
[2:14:00] <BlackermanZX> gawd damn LUL
[2:14:01] <+Tochma> Thanks
[2:14:07] <+Ultimate_Edge> Wait you can run and charge flash kick?
[2:14:07] <leith_aziz> SMOKIN SEXY STYLE !
[2:14:08] <+ManimalCrackerss> FORSAAAAKEN I HAVE AWAAAAKEEENED
[2:14:12] <this_guy_115> REMINDER maximum impact is non-canon
[2:14:17] <this_guy_115> SeemsGood
[2:14:20] <Man_in_the_Red> @mordexai0 i think you are correct doodOuch
[2:14:20] <Gutsandlove> jesus
[2:14:25] <MayorRev> J A C K P O T
[2:14:25] <Revzero25> @ultimate_edge yea you can do that in 13
[2:14:26] <TheVoltStrike> man ash can TOD you with like, 2 bars and full drive i think, but if you drop the combo they will murder you immediately because you hit them so much they got full meter
[2:14:27] <leith_aziz> Me with Nago
[2:14:28] <whimsicallifestyle> when you play that game where you're not supposed to let the balloon fall to the ground
[2:14:32] <alphalejandro> Iori's flames
[2:14:33] <dds333a> Well, Ash is uhh, yeah, not many people did. also the LAUGH
[2:14:35] <leith_aziz> Love at first sight
[2:14:35] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:14:39] <BlackermanZX> This is some SunhiLegend shit LUL
[2:14:40] <andre11dr> Not me ,fuck Ash
[2:14:52] <KatyParry_FGC> i have a feeling chat has not see THE Ash vs Iori vid
[2:14:55] <+nooshy1> @ultimate_edge Yes. Shift the input to down forward during the run. Keeps the run input and is charging down at the same time.
[2:14:58] <andre11dr> I love Shen Woo tho
[2:15:08] <+BarbosaEdit> HOLY
[2:15:14] <+Ultimate_Edge> That it is absolutely nuts
[2:15:15] <+BarbosaEdit> goddamn
[2:15:15] <%wibbwobbler> extend the combo why not
[2:15:21] <this_guy_115> Ash is the leadt well recieved protag of the KoF series, even Shun'ei is considered alright by a lot of fans compared to Ash
[2:15:24] <+FuqBoiSlim> Animalistic Behavior
[2:15:28] <leith_aziz> I think Chipp for me would be a love at first sight kinda deal. Cool combos and a comedic/goofy personality
[2:15:41] <InXplotch> i wish there was a way to play kof13 with rollback, that'd be fun
[2:15:44] <+DeaconBluesClues> @KatyParry_FGC I mentioned it a moment ago. @WoolieVersus show chat the Iori vs Ash video
[2:16:00] <dds333a> Ash just beating on his teammates, man
[2:16:02] <KatyParry_FGC> @InXplotch for now your best bet is the parsec XIII tournaments
[2:16:07] <KatyParry_FGC> theres another 1 on the 20th
[2:16:08] <this_guy_115> (You will not see combos in this video)
[2:16:10] <convo445> if old guilty gear games can have it what's really standing in the way?
[2:16:14] <%TopTieramisu> really? i definitely dislike shun'ei the most
[2:16:16] <leith_aziz> An American ninja weeb who's president of a Kingdom. how can you not love the man
[2:16:17] <Revzero25> Would it be possible for 13 to get rollback?
[2:16:24] <KatyParry_FGC> yes
[2:16:27] <leith_aziz> @Revzero25 Ask Code Mystics
[2:16:29] <KatyParry_FGC> its probably hard and expensive
[2:16:34] <spinbel> Practical: Don't pick Ashe
[2:16:35] <%mtlsars> yeah this looks awfully cute in a combo exhibition
[2:16:41] <andre11dr> Sadly you never see this shit because everyone plays the other Ash instead
[2:16:42] <Man_in_the_Red> Code Mystic hasnt touched this so give it a decade
[2:16:43] <this_guy_115> I respect anyone who uses charge characters well
[2:16:43] <leith_aziz> Apparently sprite work uses less GPU power, so its easier
[2:16:48] <leith_aziz> So.... Maybe ?
[2:16:52] <KatyParry_FGC> im no expert but im thinking for 13 to get rollback you'd need to break it down and rebuild it like NRS did with MKX for PC
[2:16:52] <andre11dr> Shit i forgot his name
[2:17:00] <%gatorafan> *2003
[2:17:01] <this_guy_115> Saiki
[2:17:01] <+Mordexai0> @andre11dr Dark Ash?
[2:17:05] <this_guy_115> the big bad
[2:17:12] <andre11dr> No the final boss dude
[2:17:14] <leith_aziz> @KatyParry_FGC Yep, for any Fighting game
[2:17:21] <dds333a> Saiki, yeah
[2:17:21] <+Mordexai0> @andre11dr Saiki
[2:17:23] <this_guy_115> White palette ash is Saiki
[2:17:24] <KatyParry_FGC> code mystics said they'd need to see the code to know if adding rollback is possible, but SNK has to commission them for that
[2:17:26] <%trustycoyote> @KatyParry_FGC I mean they spent so much on XIII anyway - may be worth it to add rollback to keep the title going
[2:17:26] <%mtlsars> but this char doesnt seem very solid
[2:17:27] <Revzero25> @katyparry_fgc holy crap, that would cost a lot
[2:17:31] <andre11dr> That's the one
[2:17:32] <leith_aziz> Strive did it early at development, so it was easier to implement
[2:17:42] <leith_aziz> THAT is how you do it. Early
[2:17:42] <DrBeanie> YES
[2:17:44] <KatyParry_FGC> @trustycoyote i think its completely valid
[2:17:45] <+NarcissistCactus> that video is sick
[2:17:55] <passserby> "What it feels like to play Ash"
[2:17:56] <DrBeanie> that video is the funniest kof shit
[2:17:57] <KatyParry_FGC> @WoolieVersus KOF XIII "What it feels like to play Ash" (Mr. KoF vs CafeId Such)
[2:17:58] <RompFGC> how it feels playing ash
[2:17:59] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @spinbel
[2:18:00] <%gatorafan> Ohhh the one that showd up on Will it Kill?

[2:27:28] <Roasted_Pheasant> RIP best femboy
[2:27:32] <this_guy_115> This is Ash's 13 theme, since he wasn't in a team

[2:27:36] <andre11dr> People loved Claw Iori su much that they gave him flames back LUL
[2:27:37] <%TopTieramisu> well at times
[2:27:45] <%phd_in_thuggery> He's so NB it's great
[2:28:01] <%TopTieramisu> claw iori is for lore reasons. regular iori is a staple of kof
[2:28:01] <%AlcoholicBlackGuy> Do you truly play charge characters if you don't partition
[2:28:16] <leith_aziz> I suppose this might be a rude question, but I wonder if you feel like this is neccessary for you to play ok. I think you know well enough to be decent (ignore my question otherwise)
[2:28:20] <jotabranded> i was trying this shit combo like 2 days ago, it hurts
[2:28:21] <%TopTieramisu> it's like getting rid of ryu in sf
[2:28:35] <dds333a> I'm not really a fan of Ash, but he is an extremely pretty boy. Shion in All Star also fucked me up because he looks good, fuck it, I guess

[2:29:14] <+Flatopia> Ash was the first character that got me into charge characters. I'm still real bad at them but Ash showed me they all aren't all turtles.
[2:29:19] <%Dante_Namikaze1> there's not enough Ash art out there
[2:29:43] <leith_aziz> Leo Whitefang is the only charge character I play
[2:29:45] <%phd_in_thuggery> It's cause he's FUCKING DEAD
[2:29:58] <+b_aleph> @leith_aziz try Leona
[2:30:10] <+Flatopia> You can't be dead if you just removed your existence :^)
[2:30:11] <%phd_in_thuggery> I play a bit of Leona
[2:30:11] <%TopTieramisu> since when has a character being dead stopped them from coming back?
[2:30:16] <this_guy_115> @phd_in_thuggery As of 14 Ash is alive
[2:30:17] <%phd_in_thuggery> she's the only charge I know
[2:30:26] <@Menitta> Leo is similar to Ash
[2:30:29] <@Menitta> kinda
[2:30:31] <dds333a> @b_aleph seconded. although Leona's got a whole bunch of other shit
[2:30:47] <leith_aziz> I care about FG stories, but characters coming back is something you need to expect. As player want dictates who needs to come back for the roster
[2:30:51] <+RazzloJ> l
[2:30:57] <andre11dr> @toptieramisu You can literally play as Geeses corpse in 14
[2:31:05] <Revzero25> Is Leona good as a beginner charge character
[2:31:09] <+Ultimate_Edge> Fuck story. Geese needs to be playable
[2:31:10] <%TopTieramisu> i don't mind vice being resurrected again and again
[2:31:11] <alphalejandro> @TopTieramisu Try Rugal, Goetnitz, Orochi, Krizalid, Clone Zero, Zero, Igniz, etc.
[2:31:15] <leith_aziz> @andre11dr Geese never died in KOF, os thats not a good example
[2:31:20] <%TopTieramisu> rugal?
[2:31:24] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> oh...it's a hat and not a large bun
[2:31:29] <this_guy_115> Vice and Mature are still dead as well
[2:31:31] <+b_aleph> Ye, Leona is like Leo, but you switch the ground crossups and stance for the best air game in KOF
[2:31:31] <leith_aziz> @TopTieramisu Yep. He came back
[2:31:35] <+jeaguerjack> max is not good source for kof lore people
[2:31:36] <+Flatopia> it's like blazblue. You're crazy if you think ragna ain't comin back
[2:31:36] <KatyParry_FGC> vice n mature been dead
[2:31:41] <dds333a> @kosorsomesaykosm_ no, you're right
[2:31:48] <%TopTieramisu> yeah, rugal has been a lot of games since he died
[2:31:48] <%phd_in_thuggery> Vice and Mature are the real big losses tbh
[2:31:51] <CalderGaming> @Dante_Namikaze1 BokuBunBun on twitter did a couple recently
[2:31:52] <%TopTieramisu> been in*
[2:31:55] <Adwark> Max overall isn't really good fighting games lore source LUL
[2:31:58] <andre11dr> @leith_aziz Rugal dies like 4 times
[2:32:07] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @dds333a what a magical game
[2:32:11] <+vaporousTippler> Rugal kinda can't die.
[2:32:31] <leith_aziz> @Adwark That has been a crux (i think its called) for lore people like us
[2:32:31] <alphalejandro> In lore Rugal died in '95
[2:32:32] <+b_aleph> I mean, Rugal has been canonically dead since the end of 95...
[2:32:33] <Adwark> @phd_in_thuggery Mature and Vice died in like... 96 I think? like here in KoF 13 they are actually still dead LUL
[2:32:36] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[2:32:44] <%TopTieramisu> and igniz isn't coming back because he's a poorly designed boss that has no charm
[2:32:50] <this_guy_115> Vice and Mature are poltergeists lol, sent by orochi to haunt iori and make sure no one threaten's orochi's existence
[2:33:03] <+MrAtheGreat> swag oir die
[2:33:03] <andre11dr> @toptieramisu Nah i like Igniz
[2:33:05] <%AlcoholicBlackGuy> optimization station is like the final hurdle
[2:33:07] <+b_aleph> @Adwark correct
[2:33:09] <this_guy_115> Rugal canonically dies in 95 and all other appearances are non-canon
[2:33:12] <%wibbwobbler> gotta swag
[2:33:18] <+b_aleph> Iori kills them both in his ending
[2:33:19] <dds333a> Rugal is canonically dead, but his hobby IS resurrection
[2:33:28] <%TopTieramisu> @andre11dr surprised you can say that after getting infinited off just his dp
[2:33:30] <+b_aleph> No wonder no one partnered with him in 97
[2:33:33] <this_guy_115> As of 14, Rugal is now alive
[2:33:33] <deafmelone> Igniz slander is a new one to me damn lol
[2:33:35] <+Shmario> @this_guy_115 yeah.... until kof 13
[2:33:38] <lonosi55> They still doing this????
[2:33:43] <Adwark> @TopTieramisu As long they get Norio Wakamoto to voice him, I'm ok with Igniz return LUL
[2:33:48] <alphalejandro> @this_guy_115 Because of Verse
[2:33:53] <this_guy_115> yes
[2:33:53] <dds333a> @deafmelone fr
[2:33:54] <leith_aziz> If fans want someone back, the devs will be forced to bring them back no matter what. Lets say Baiken died. People still want her in, so now devs have to justify her comng back
[2:33:55] <%TopTieramisu> norio already does omega rugal LUL
[2:34:06] <InXplotch> is this supposed to combo?
[2:34:09] <+Ultimate_Edge> You think they are even gonna bring back Antonov?
[2:34:10] <KatyParry_FGC> bring back sports team
[2:34:17] <@Menitta> @lonosi55 If you dont want to watch, don't. Simple as that. Stop complaining.
[2:34:18] <jotabranded> rugal is alive again in XIV, no? I thought everyone revived after Verse
[2:34:21] <leith_aziz> This is an issue where sales > stakes for devs
[2:34:23] <andre11dr> They should bring the 96 boss team back
[2:34:24] <this_guy_115> Yes they did
[2:34:39] <alphalejandro> @jotabranded That's is the idea
[2:34:40] <deafmelone> I could see Antonov coming back
[2:34:41] <+Tochma> Tyey just put them back in noncanon
[2:34:41] <Roasted_Pheasant> Yeah ash sacrificed to reboot the universe
[2:34:44] <andre11dr> Or at least Krauser
[2:34:44] <thatangryguyofde> boy if he hates 6B into a charge move, he won't like Takuma LUL
[2:34:45] <%gatorafan> Verse exploding brought a bunch of people back just so they can steal the USA Sports team invitations Kappa
[2:34:45] <leith_aziz> But unfortunately it really hurts the narrative when it comes to stakes
[2:34:49] <+mMayrro> muh reading comprehension
[2:34:53] <+b_aleph> Verse was so lame. It was like SNK saying we want to use the dead characters out of dream matches, but we'll bring them back in the lamest way possible
[2:34:55] <%TopTieramisu> igniz isn't the lamest kof boss though. magaki is ResidentSleeper
[2:34:56] <this_guy_115> Confirmed revived characters are: New Face Team, Igniz, Krizalid, Rugal, and Leona's dad
[2:34:57] <dds333a> @katyparry_fgc they're definitely coming back. they're exactly the kind of characters that are brought back to be like "hey, remember these guys?c
[2:35:03] <Roasted_Pheasant> @gatorafan Dis ball!
[2:35:06] <this_guy_115> also it wasn't a reboot
[2:35:18] <@Menitta> I can't be the only one who thought Heidern was a boss at first right
[2:35:34] <deafmelone> Which is worse, Magaki or Jivatma?
[2:35:35] <andre11dr> @toptieramisu What about that stone dude in 03 that i can't even remember the name of?
[2:35:43] <+Ultimate_Edge> He definitely looks like a boss at first glance
[2:35:43] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1369188817492656132?s=19
[2:35:44] <+mMayrro> oh god jivatma monkaS
[2:35:46] <%gatorafan> I'm pretty sure at one point heidern was supposed to be like... an alien or some shit. daedra1DerpyTibs
[2:35:48] <+b_aleph> @deafmelone Magaki. Free
[2:35:49] <dds333a> @andre11dr Mukai. he's tight
[2:35:51] <this_guy_115> He died by Saiki's hands, he's still dead as of 14
[2:35:52] <%TopTieramisu> @andre11dr he's not great either, but i think he looks better than magaki at least
[2:35:57] <alphalejandro> What about Chris tho, he become Otochi and the Sacred Tresure team have already deal with him
[2:35:59] <@Menitta> He was supposed to be an alien?!
[2:35:59] <%gatorafan> Good thing that didn't take off.
[2:36:03] <leith_aziz> Who would KOF fans consider the lamest/most forgettable ?
[2:36:07] <+b_aleph> Mukai an Krizalid are really cool
[2:36:11] <$silentblast93> crap
[2:36:16] <mecha_soul> Magaki as a boss fight was worse
[2:36:16] <this_guy_115> boss? has to be mukai or magaki
[2:36:17] <jotabranded> i'm fine with Ash dying for Shermie and Yashiro LUL
[2:36:21] <this_guy_115> or verse actually tbh
[2:36:26] <+b_aleph> @leith_aziz Eiji Kisaragi
[2:36:28] <%TopTieramisu> actually, orochi himself was pretty lame
[2:36:31] <dds333a> @leith_aziz Eiji. for me. a lot of people love Eiji
[2:36:33] <andre11dr> Krizalid and Zero are pretty cool
[2:36:36] <+mMayrro> @leith_aziz clone zero, tho his theme in 2000 is sick
[2:36:40] <this_guy_115> REMINDER Heroines is canon so New Face team is definitely alive
[2:36:46] <deafmelone> I hate fighting Magaki, but I prefer him over Jivatma
[2:36:49] <%gatorafan> God Orochi was such a disappointment, good thing the previous fight was cool.
[2:36:56] <dds333a> Holy shit! @b_aleph said it right when I posted it
[2:36:58] <%TopTieramisu> chris was wasted on orochi
[2:36:59] <+b_aleph> For boss it would totally be Verse
[2:37:05] <%gatorafan> Rythmic Halluciation is a 10/10 theme
[2:37:06] <%TopTieramisu> chris, shermie, and yashiro
[2:37:09] <phd_in_thuggery> We out here practicing boiz
[2:37:17] <@Menitta> Saltybet ruined my perception of a lot of KOF characters
[2:37:18] <andre11dr> I wish the ghost dude that helps Zero was playable
[2:37:18] <+b_aleph> @dds333a There's my(your) confirmation!
[2:37:27] <leith_aziz> I dont know much about Orochi, but I know that arc ended really well
[2:37:30] <$silentblast93> so are we shaking off the rust rn?
[2:37:35] <%TopTieramisu> the orochi fight was lame
[2:37:36] <%gatorafan> @menitta, Goenitz is top waifu Kappa
[2:37:44] <@Menitta> LUL
[2:37:45] <jotabranded> @andre11dr my brother say the same shit.. dunno why
[2:37:49] <%TopTieramisu> goenitz is pretty cool
[2:37:55] <leith_aziz> Like fans consider it one of the best ends to an arc (in the KOF series)
[2:38:00] <this_guy_115> Yes
[2:38:10] <+b_aleph> @andre11dr Dude, he's such a big deal in the lore, you have no idea
[2:38:13] <%TopTieramisu> @leith_aziz it's competition was NESTS saga and the ash saga...
[2:38:17] <Adwark> @Menitta and his theme is pure SourPls
[2:38:19] <+b_aleph> His name is Ron, BTW
[2:38:21] <%TopTieramisu> its*
[2:38:30] <andre11dr> Yeah Ron that was it
[2:38:33] <leith_aziz> @TopTieramisu What was NESTS about ?
[2:38:38] <leith_aziz> New name for me
[2:38:50] <andre11dr> I think the lion had a name too if i remember
[2:38:52] <%TopTieramisu> @leith_aziz the secret organization that was obsessed with world domination and cloning kyo
[2:39:01] <%gatorafan> I say NESTS started pretty strong, I liked Krizallid. daedra1DerpyTibs
[2:39:04] <%TopTieramisu> it ended with beating igniz, the leader of NESTS
[2:39:08] <alphalejandro> I think for XV team new face/orochi is going to be Yashiro and Shermie plus Goetnitz, because and again, Chris became Orochi and he was put to sleep by the Sacred Treasure team in XIV
[2:39:10] <leith_aziz> @TopTieramisu Oh that. Yeah I found those villians lame
[2:39:14] <+b_aleph> Psycho soldiers and the Lon ninjas are all connected to him
[2:39:15] <@Menitta> I like the boss of Garou
[2:39:19] <@Menitta> Kane
[2:39:26] <%TopTieramisu> kane is cool
[2:39:36] <dds333a> @menitta before I knew what kof was, I thought Heidern was an antagonist. now, after playing for almost two decades. I know he's the coolest
[2:39:41] <this_guy_115> KOF LORE: The is a hidden SIDE ARC in the kof series starting with nests that revolves around the Flying Brigands, a secret ninja clan
[2:39:42] <deafmelone> I liked Krizalid with the coat better, wish he kept it on
[2:39:43] <Adwark> @alphalejandro Actually wasn't deal with Orochi in that one ending of KoF14 that he lacked Chris vessel thing, and it was more like Orochi soul itself?
[2:39:44] <+Ultimate_Edge> I'd agree if I didn't still feel the sting of losing to Kane
[2:39:51] <andre11dr> Actually yeah FUCK IT just make Zeros dumb black lion playable and im sold on 15
[2:40:03] <TyrantTr1z > !gear
[2:40:04] <jotabranded> igniz is the bad clone of K', right?
[2:40:12] <this_guy_115> No
[2:40:17] <+b_aleph> @jotabranded no, that's krizalid
[2:40:23] <this_guy_115> Igniz is the head honcho of the NESTS cartel, the big bad
[2:40:24] <jotabranded> oh yeah sorry
[2:40:26] <%TopTieramisu> @jotabranded krizalid
[2:40:33] <%gatorafan> @this_guy_115, That went nowhere... I think it was solved offscreen between XI and XIII?
[2:40:33] <this_guy_115> Krizalid is the perfrct K' clone
[2:40:36] <leith_aziz> Im guessing Terry's team would be: Terry, Rock and Blue Mary ? Maybe it'd be a Rock, Geese and "someone else" team for crazy sake's
[2:40:48] <dds333a> @deafmelone I agree, funny enough. he gets another jacket in '01
[2:40:56] <this_guy_115> @gatorafan No its never been solved
[2:41:01] <alphalejandro> @Adwark good point, i only assumed that Orochi was Chris
[2:41:03] <+b_aleph> @this_guy_115 second in command, actually. He kills the boss(also named Nests) just before you fight him in 2001
[2:41:05] <this_guy_115> because it neber GOES anywhere lol
[2:41:06] <jotabranded> aaaaahh Igniz is the son of that old man, i remember now
[2:41:12] <TyrantTr1z > super new here, stick player yeah?
[2:41:21] <%phd_in_thuggery> EVOLVE OR DIE
[2:41:22] <CalderGaming> LIVID
[2:41:23] <dds333a> Yeah, especially when you're close
[2:41:35] <andre11dr> Igniz has a badass man voice tho
[2:41:41] <%TopTieramisu> @this_guy_115 yo, i actually forgot about that
[2:41:56] <%TopTieramisu> igniz has norio wakamoto doing the voice. that's cheating
[2:41:58] <+DeaconBluesClues> whos a good low execution character so you dont gotta do this shit lol
[2:42:07] <Revzero25> Kyo
[2:42:09] <this_guy_115> All shotos
[2:42:14] <Revzero25> Ryo
[2:42:15] <%phd_in_thuggery> I found out a while back that Magaki's actor in KOF11 is apparently Jonathan Joestar
[2:42:15] <leith_aziz> K' apparently
[2:42:21] <+Ultimate_Edge> Grapplers depending on your definition of execution
[2:42:25] <+TopTieramisu> kyo is higher execution than K'
[2:42:35] <+b_aleph> @DeaconBluesClues most of the cast, really. but in XIII the high level play is this crazy for everyone
[2:42:43] <RompFGC> you should try robert from the king of fighters
[2:42:44] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:42:46] <+mMayrro> ash squatting is such a weird sight
[2:42:47] <deafmelone> @phd_in_thuggery thats nuts
[2:42:49] <+DeaconBluesClues> I play faust in Gg and win every round by throwing garbage at people until they die
[2:42:51] <Revzero25> Really? I always found kyo to be easier
[2:42:58] <andre11dr> Isn't Iori voiced by the Kiryu guy?
[2:43:20] <%DomPressesButtons> I dunno
[2:43:25] <leith_aziz> @andre11dr WHAT ?
[2:43:27] <%Mrthefro> Is Woolie dressed like a sultan judging by his sleeves?
[2:43:28] <%phd_in_thuggery> voice actors are wild
[2:43:28] <deafmelone> I think Ron is voiced by Kiryu
[2:43:32] <+b_aleph> Depends on what Kyo we're talking about
[2:43:37] <PMda2nd> glove just teleported on
[2:43:39] <+kennneh> Wait Woolie is a filthy pad player?
[2:43:47] <+The_Devil_Breaker> It is known
[2:43:47] <leith_aziz> Takaya Kuroda is in this game ?
[2:43:49] <Revzero25> I’m talking ex kyo
[2:43:58] <%phd_in_thuggery> @Mrthefro Woolie with the REAL drip
[2:43:58] <leith_aziz> As a Yakuza fan, im shocked
[2:44:02] <Revzero25> I never liked fireball kyo
[2:44:15] <leith_aziz> Wait, im in Woolie's channel
[2:44:15] <%TopTieramisu> fireball kyo was a bit too shoto inspired
[2:44:20] <+DeaconBluesClues> @kennneh its current year 2021. we only shit on mixbox players now get with the times
[2:44:21] <+b_aleph> Rekka Kyo is harder than K, hands down
[2:44:26] <%TopTieramisu> i mean, he was made in 94 so it makes sense
[2:44:27] <leith_aziz> No shit chat knows Yakuza
[2:44:28] <+Ultimate_Edge> I like fireball kyo's upkicks. Otherwise, it just feels wrong
[2:44:29] <%BusterRepukken> rekka Kyo would become a thing in 96.
[2:44:51] <this_guy_115> yes
[2:44:53] <%BusterRepukken> i have a soft spot for KOF 96 because it has the Boss Team of Geese/Krauser and Mr Big
[2:45:11] <+b_aleph> Krauser is so sick in 96/98
[2:45:12] <%BusterRepukken> speaking of, can Krauser come back too in 15, thatd be cool.
[2:45:22] <this_guy_115> The canon reason for the moveset shift is that he was bested by Goenitz before 96
[2:45:25] <leith_aziz> Is Krauser cannon in KOF timeline ?
[2:45:27] <dds333a> @phd_in_thuggery really, Magaki and Jojo had the same voice
[2:45:35] <%TopTieramisu> i like how krauser's signature kaiser wave is attributed to rugal
[2:45:40] <%TopTieramisu> even though rugal stole that move
[2:45:45] <andre11dr> @b_aleph Fuck yeah, we need the 96 boss team back
[2:45:51] <%gatorafan> @busterrepukken, Dust Man is such a cool song. Kreygasm
[2:45:55] <%BusterRepukken> Krauser takes his own life in the FF timeline
[2:46:03] <%BusterRepukken> because he was so booty blasted over losing to Terry
[2:46:09] <leith_aziz> @BusterRepukken But in KOF....
[2:46:09] <andre11dr> Krauser and Mr Big need to return
[2:46:12] <dds333a> @toptieramisu man, it stings sometimes.
[2:46:15] <+b_aleph> Krauser is alive in KOF
[2:46:28] <leith_aziz> But damn. He killed himself...
[2:46:33] <leith_aziz> What salt
[2:46:33] <%TopTieramisu> @BusterRepukken seems to be a pattern with terry's enemies
[2:46:38] <deafmelone> Rugal really is Geese and Krauser combined huh?
[2:46:48] <CoffeeKaiju> Ash sure is rad
[2:46:54] <%TopTieramisu> but rugal has a unique move that is the coolest of all
[2:46:58] <%BusterRepukken> kinda, but rugal is unique
[2:46:58] <Adwark> @leith_aziz Well Rugal was just as salty, except he wanted also to take down those who beaten him with him to grave LUL
[2:47:02] <leith_aziz> @deafmelone I would consider Rugal his own thing (at least compared to Geese)
[2:47:04] <%TopTieramisu> genocide cutter is the best
[2:47:05] <CoffeeKaiju> but like man i have a hard time justifying picking him
[2:47:23] <Zerotoad5> Yeah
[2:47:24] <andre11dr> @deafmelone Yeah his like tha mater of the those styles because he has Orochi powers
[2:47:27] <deafmelone> Genocide Cutter and God Pres 'll
[2:47:30] <dds333a> @toptieramisu shoutouts to Dead End Screamer too
[2:47:34] <+b_aleph> @Adwark his suicide was an accident tho
[2:47:37] <deafmelone> God Press
[2:47:40] <%BusterRepukken> Adelheid has all of Rugals moves but they're weak, thats the trade off
[2:47:41] <Aramonde_San> KonCha Woolie KonCha chat
[2:47:43] <leith_aziz> @Adwark Yeah, but Geese was less serious to an extent. And the Engrish didnt help
[2:47:50] <HeavyNorse> Ash is so cute! Hope he'll be in KOFXV! ♥
[2:48:00] <%TopTieramisu> @dds333a the wall slam? yeah that's great
[2:48:17] <CoffeeKaiju> @HeavyNorse he's dead but that doesn't mean much for kof. i'd like to see him back too
[2:48:26] <%TopTieramisu> geese's engrish is a feature
[2:48:28] <this_guy_115> KOF LORE: Rugal has the power of learning moves as soon as he sees them, which is why he was considered the best martial artist in 94
[2:48:29] <%TopTieramisu> not a bug
[2:48:34] <dds333a> @toptieramisu the neck break
[2:48:39] <andre11dr> I do love the detail that Rugal is so OP he doesn't need to spend meter to do a Kaiso Wave
[2:48:41] <leith_aziz> Dude I love Geese's Engrish
[2:48:42] <%BusterRepukken> they almost made Rugal's boss fight even cheaper in KOF 95 but they held back.
[2:48:45] <HeavyNorse> KOFXIV ending spoilers: He's not dead anymore.
[2:48:51] <David_de_Bergerac> so is the whole saudi arabian prince thing still an issue or what's up with that
[2:48:51] <CoffeeKaiju> OH
[2:48:57] <%Dante_Namikaze1> @this_guy_115 so he's just Taskmaster
[2:49:04] <this_guy_115> Yes
[2:49:05] <+Ultimate_Edge> Yeah everyone is just alive now
[2:49:07] <alphalejandro> So here's the thing about Geese in KOF, in '96 he was normal, no scar in chest Geese, in XIV he have an scar in his chest, what's the meaning of this, that if we go and look at the events of Fatal Fury, Geese on get the scar after his 1st fight with Terry, so that means that KOF Geese hasn't die yet, as Geese only died after his 2nd fight with Terry
[2:49:10] <leith_aziz> @David_de_Bergerac I think Woolie is waiting for more info
[2:49:13] <%komradedog> komradedog subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 26 months! FIGHT FOREVER!
[2:49:23] <David_de_Bergerac> @leith_aziz i see
[2:49:29] <%BusterRepukken> @David_de_Bergerac the deal might not even happen anymore, I hope so.
[2:49:35] <Pookiedaexzile> Left Handed people know the pain
[2:49:39] <CoffeeKaiju> cancel flash kick to hard punch sonicboom
[2:49:40] <Revzero25> Saudi?
[2:49:43] <Adwark> Yeah, reason why Rugal was limited back in 94 was memory limitation of hardware LUL
[2:49:58] <Adwark> (limited compared to what they wanted to do)
[2:49:58] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:50:11] <David_de_Bergerac> okay yeah because I've been waiting to see if I can in good concience buy 15 when it comes out
[2:50:11] <%BusterRepukken> i feel like 2002 UM Rugal is what they wanted to do lmao
[2:50:12] <leith_aziz> We can bring up politics another time
[2:50:15] <dds333a> @alphalejandro hell. Geese's scars disappear from time to time. he always has the chest scar, mostly, but the hundreds of other scars come and go. he even has back scars too
[2:50:20] <%gatorafan> @Adwark The original plan was to have him use every single move on the game wasn't it?
[2:50:35] <this_guy_115> Yes I think so
[2:50:37] <%BusterRepukken> yeah he was gonna be the shang tsung but it didnt pan out
[2:50:41] <Revzero25> @leith_aziz oh that stuff huh? Nvm then
[2:50:44] <dds333a> @gatorafan I think it was to copy the opponent je was fighting
[2:50:45] <andre11dr> Remember when Rugal had that dumb robo hand?
[2:50:46] <David_de_Bergerac> @leith_aziz didn't want to make it a big debate I just wanted an update on the situation lol
[2:50:50] <%BusterRepukken> so they gave him the GENOCIDE CUTTAH
[2:50:51] <%TopTieramisu> @dds333a i just saw a clip of it in 98.... rugal copter?
[2:51:09] <%BusterRepukken> Rugals KOF 95 design is rad, when he wins a match; he claws his own chest with the robo hand
[2:51:10] <leith_aziz> @David_de_Bergerac Nah its fine. Its important to consider stuff like that
[2:51:19] <alphalejandro> @dds333a But not his chest scar, like i said, he only get that scar after his 1st fight with Terry
[2:51:26] <David_de_Bergerac> yup yup
[2:51:30] <sonofthedeepsouth> Chat gotta be real with yiu. You will never have a hair as good as Ash.
[2:51:40] <David_de_Bergerac> i cry every day about thia
[2:51:41] <dds333a> @toptieramisu yep, the one where he straight up breaks the opponents neck, and then grinds them. he even flexes in '02 when he's done
[2:51:49] <Zerotoad5> Sans is hard
[2:51:51] <leith_aziz> We're all humans, and we feel guilt from time to time
[2:51:56] <%BusterRepukken> @David_de_Bergerac its your money, do whatever you want with it. its fine.

[2:52:17] <dds333a> @alphalejandro yeah, you're right
[2:52:22] <David_de_Bergerac> @busterrepukken I'd rather my money support as few hate crimes as possible though
[2:52:23] <andre11dr> @sonofthedeepsouth I will never have those hips too,that man got forms
[2:52:26] <leith_aziz> @David_de_Bergerac I hope you relize this is about the government, not Arabs in general
[2:52:38] <David_de_Bergerac> @leith_aziz Yes of course
[2:52:43] <sonofthedeepsouth> woolieKICKDAD_RB
[2:52:52] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[2:52:53] <leith_aziz> @David_de_Bergerac Thank you (coming from an Arab)
[2:53:05] <andre11dr> OH SHIT ,they going top tier LUL
[2:53:07] <dds333a> Which Takuma, tho, lmao
[2:53:08] <%BusterRepukken> @David_de_Bergerac Yeah we all understand. Me personally; I'm probably buying KOF 15 regardless because I've accepted that my money will go to someone shitty no matter what I do. Its the way the world is.
[2:53:20] <%BusterRepukken> so Ill just buy the things I enjoy
[2:53:23] <andre11dr> At least it's not Mr Karate
[2:53:34] <this_guy_115> OH YEAH this Art of Fighting team theme is also one of my favorites
[2:53:39] <dds333a> Takuma is so cool, goddamn
[2:53:41] <%TopTieramisu> mr karate's neck is thicker than his head
[2:53:42] <leith_aziz> @David_de_Bergerac: Personally I never played a KOF before, so I can just ignore the gamne I guess
[2:53:43] <Roasted_Pheasant> FBF MOTIONS? PogChamp
[2:53:46] <David_de_Bergerac> @busterrepukken I mean there's no ethical consumption under capitalism for sure but it's the principle of the matter I'd say
[2:53:48] <andre11dr> Me Karate is the darkest of sides
[2:54:00] <this_guy_115> The freakiest shoto freak to ever walk the earth
[2:54:09] <whimsicallifestyle> i like how this other palette for takuma is just him but whitewashed
[2:54:10] <+b_aleph> Oh, we're talking about that? Don't forget, if it doesn't go to the Saudi gov, it goes to the Chinese. Uyghur, Falun Dafa, Tiananmen Square, etc etc
[2:54:11] <%TopTieramisu> takuma*
[2:54:11] <leith_aziz> So this guy is also Mr Karate huh
[2:54:14] <sonofthedeepsouth> Just do it LMAO
[2:54:23] <+captain_history> remember when Takuma deflected a orbital laser with a Haoh Sho Ko Ken?
[2:54:25] <this_guy_115> I don't think Ryu can beat Takuma with all the plot armor in the WORLD
[2:54:28] <David_de_Bergerac> @b_aleph World is a fuck
[2:54:33] <%BusterRepukken> @David_de_Bergerac Yeah but I only have so much emotional bandwidth to go around. My favorite drink ius Vanilla Coke and they pay for death squads in Columbia.
[2:54:34] <leith_aziz> I know that name more when he wears a mask
[2:54:38] <Doplghost> God this game is so cool!
[2:54:47] <%TopTieramisu> ryu kinda loses a lot in the lore
[2:54:52] <Roasted_Pheasant> Yeah Reggie! Damage is high!
[2:54:54] <Zerotoad5> Mr Karate is prob who you are thinking of
[2:55:05] <andre11dr> Well Mr Karate is THE BEST caracter hands down
[2:55:10] <%TopTieramisu> he would have lost to sagat if he didn't pull out the dark hadou trap card
[2:55:12] <ElPlasa> that's a WHOLE ASS COMBO
[2:55:25] <Zerotoad5> I would argue Ex iori but yeah both amazing
[2:55:27] <David_de_Bergerac> anyway back to the fun times. didn't mean to brkng the room down. Sorry Woolie if you saw it.
[2:55:29] <sonofthedeepsouth> do combo
[2:55:32] <this_guy_115> KOF LORE: Takuma is such a shoto god uver freak that in multiple points in the series he straight up launches a HITBOX at you instead of a visible projectile
[2:55:38] <%BusterRepukken> @David_de_Bergerac nah its cool, dont worry about it.
[2:55:47] <andre11dr> Dude i feel like Takuma would FUCK UP Akuma if they ever fought
[2:55:52] <+b_aleph> @this_guy_115 that's my favorite version of him
[2:55:58] <Doplghost> the Restand
[2:56:06] <David_de_Bergerac> this game is 2hard4me
[2:56:17] <%BusterRepukken> anyway, can we get Mr Karate Ryo in KOF 15 with his black gi and beard. that design rules
[2:56:17] <sonofthedeepsouth> Ka-ra-te
[2:56:18] <+mMayrro> kyokugen ryu Kreygasm
[2:56:18] <alphalejandro> We're talking about the man who deflected a ray of death from the sky with his super
[2:56:18] <David_de_Bergerac> it runs on a toaster though which is nice
[2:56:24] <BlackermanZX> In canon Takuma is so op he parried and reflected a goddamn laser
[2:56:24] <Man_in_the_Red> Akuma lost to an old geiser, that isnt fair
[2:56:31] <HeavyNorse> Mr Karate VS Akuma, you say? SVC Chaos made that happen.
[2:56:37] <redmoon108> I still can’t do the Fire ball to DP short cuts 😆
[2:56:39] <+b_aleph> Akuma doesn't have shit compared to Takuma
[2:56:39] <+captain_history> yeah, canon takuma is absurd
[2:56:48] <Arek_1> Ansatsuken vs. Kyokugen?
[2:56:49] <leith_aziz> I'd like it if Ryu interacted more with Ken, as he doesnt have much going for him as a character at this point. Either he beats Akuma or they do something new with him
[2:56:55] <$emptyantics> Can’t wait for Shen Woo reveal for KOF XV!
[2:56:56] <Man_in_the_Red> no offense to Gen players out there... dont hurt me
[2:57:10] <%TopTieramisu> oh, geezer
[2:57:10] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:57:12] <%BusterRepukken> dont worry if you cant do stuff, I own KOF games on classic cartridges and I still cant do this kinda stuff.
[2:57:15] <kikoeru_san> Wait are they not going to play Mr.Karate
[2:57:21] <Roasted_Pheasant> Gen players scare me
[2:57:23] <+Katohearts> This art has a really good feel to it
[2:57:23] <%TopTieramisu> i was wonder when akuma lost to a geyser
[2:57:29] <leith_aziz> I thought Gen was the one that lost ?
[2:57:35] <this_guy_115> I don't think the stream can handle the power of Mr. Karate
[2:57:44] <%TopTieramisu> i believe the fight stopped because akuma realized gen was dying anyways
[2:57:44] <Roasted_Pheasant> Gen tanked a raging demon and lived
[2:57:45] <%BusterRepukken> Im gonna have a hot take: Kyo is a better MC than Ryu.
[2:57:47] <%TopTieramisu> from natural causes
[2:57:54] <+captain_history> the EX characters in this game are super broken
[2:57:57] <+b_aleph> Is Gen dead in the canon by SFV or SFIII?
[2:57:58] <Revzero25> Isn’t oro like the strongest sf character
[2:58:05] <this_guy_115> Kyo has more personality than Ryu lol
[2:58:08] <BlackermanZX> Ryu is a hobo who has no family and no friends woolieMIRIN
[2:58:11] <kikoeru_san> Nah the Ex characters are nothing compared to Kim
[2:58:12] <$emptyantics> @busterrepukken Any KOF character is a better character than Ryu
[2:58:22] <kikoeru_san> They're good, but Kim..Kim is evil
[2:58:23] <Roasted_Pheasant> @Revzero25 Oro is so op he ties a hand behind his back for fun and is still the strongest being on earth
[2:58:26] <this_guy_115> Any SF CHARACTER is a better character than Ryu
[2:58:32] <+Ultimate_Edge> Ryu is closer to blank state karate man so everyone can love him.
[2:58:34] <andre11dr> Kyo is WAY better than Ryu to me ,he like actually talks shit
[2:58:36] <HeavyNorse> Ryu has quite a few friends, but he's still a boring character.
[2:58:36] <leith_aziz> @BusterRepukken Well there's not much to argue there. Ken on the other hand would be SO much better as the MC
[2:58:37] <Man_in_the_Red> @this_guy_115 Ryu from Streets isnt a high bar to clear to be fair, he aint Scorpion cardboard but not great
[2:58:38] <%gatorafan> @kikoeru_san Kim is JUSTICE
[2:58:53] <%TopTieramisu> yeah, kyo definitely has more personality
[2:58:58] <%BusterRepukken> Kyo talking shit as he does his supers is great.
[2:59:02] <HeavyNorse> And style.
[2:59:04] <leith_aziz> I like the people AROUND Ryu more. Ken, Gen, Sakure etc
[2:59:09] <%TopTieramisu> kyo's also a dumbass that can't finish high school
[2:59:18] <this_guy_115> KOF LORE: Kim has the canon power to sense any form of evil, due to the innate amount of JUSTICE within him
[2:59:22] <%TopTieramisu> but that adds to his character
[2:59:25] <Roasted_Pheasant> The red ranger is rarely the most interesting character
[2:59:33] <%BusterRepukken> but Kyo is so cool he influenced Shingo to follow him
[2:59:36] <Arek_1> @Revzero25 What's more is that in Karin's story in SFV, it is said that Oro seals his DOMINANT left arm in fights.
[2:59:45] <kikoeru_san> God I love Kim, so much Justice
[2:59:45] <Roasted_Pheasant> Like, Wonder Red is the only interesting red ranger
[2:59:45] <sonofthedeepsouth> You know what we need. Sf4 Elena back Kappa
[2:59:52] <+captain_history> and Mushiki is such a good super move
[2:59:54] <Revzero25> So Oro is basically god
[2:59:55] <Man_in_the_Red> so Player 2 side Oro is a high tier Kappa
[2:59:56] <andre11dr> Kyo also gets some SAVAGE win quotes against Mai in some games
[3:00:04] <leith_aziz> So Kim is basically PC in a nice way ?
[3:00:08] <%BusterRepukken> Akuma and Oro fought to a standstill didnt they
[3:00:11] <%Dante_Namikaze1> @roasted_pheasant yeah but then you get the one that are good like Wes in Lost Galaxy Red
[3:00:15] <this_guy_115> yes
[3:00:21] <%Dante_Namikaze1> *ones
[3:00:22] <%BusterRepukken> but Akuma wasn't Shin Akuma and Oro has an arm tied.
[3:00:32] <%TopTieramisu> is shin akuma even canon though
[3:00:36] <Man_in_the_Red> no
[3:00:45] <sonofthedeepsouth> Is Oni canon
[3:00:45] <%TopTieramisu> right. oro using both hands can actually happen
[3:00:46] <HeavyNorse> Oni, maybe?
[3:00:49] <this_guy_115> Kim's whole deal since the beginning is to take in criminals and reform them by forcing them to join his KOF teams
[3:00:50] <%TopTieramisu> shin akuma is like evil ryu
[3:00:53] <andre11dr> Oni is canon tho
[3:00:57] <Man_in_the_Red> Oni is a What If character
[3:00:58] <%Dante_Namikaze1> @sonofthedeepsouth no he isn't
[3:01:04] <leith_aziz> Honestly I dont like when people say "This guy is so strong" instead of SHOWING us that he's strong
[3:01:07] <%TopTieramisu> oni isn't canon...?
[3:01:13] <%TopTieramisu> how can he be canon
[3:01:16] <andre11dr> Isn't Oni supposed to be better than Shin Akuma?
[3:01:19] <leith_aziz> I dont think Oni is cannon
[3:01:21] <$emptyantics> Who’s the best KOF antagonist?
[3:01:26] <HeavyNorse> Oni should've stayed... instead we got sunflower Akuma in SFV.
[3:01:29] <sonofthedeepsouth> Rugal
[3:01:29] <leith_aziz> Geese or Rugal
[3:01:30] <kikoeru_san> Rugal
[3:01:31] <this_guy_115> Krizalid obviously
[3:01:31] <dds333a> @andre11dr harsh win quotes are an snk stapl. I also love snk's 90s localization in moves and quotes
[3:01:35] <andre11dr> @emptyantics Rugal
[3:01:38] <Revzero25> Rugal
[3:01:38] <%AlcoholicBlackGuy> the lab is one of the best parts of fighting games
[3:01:38] <%BusterRepukken> i swear if someone says Zero
[3:01:42] <%TopTieramisu> rugal had orochi powers
[3:01:43] <Man_in_the_Red> @heavynorse also Dollar Store Evil Ryu
[3:01:45] <leith_aziz> I guess in KOF, Geese doesnt count
[3:01:55] <%BusterRepukken> but yeah its Rugal, Rugal is the reason SNK has its Boss syndrome rep.
[3:01:55] <leith_aziz> Thats more so Fatal Fury
[3:01:57] <Arek_1> Evil Ryu awakening is canon. It happened in Ryu's fight with Sagat in SFI. And that's it. Oni ain't canon, though.
[3:01:58] <sonofthedeepsouth> Always pick Rugal on the arcade Kappa
[3:02:06] <Man_in_the_Red> fuck, Sugarpunch was right, Kage shouldve been Ryu's VT2
[3:02:08] <HeavyNorse> Verse best boss... *cough*
[3:02:17] <%TopTieramisu> rugal is fairer than a lot of kof bosses
[3:02:18] <kikoeru_san> Like Rugal had a SPECIAL that took 1/3 your life
[3:02:23] <leith_aziz> @Man_in_the_Red Such a wasted idea
[3:02:27] <alphalejandro> Oni is suppose to be what happen if Akuma lost control of the dark hado, or something like that
[3:02:27] <%Dante_Namikaze1> @man_in_the_red that would have been so much better
[3:02:27] <$emptyantics> @man_in_the_red Agreed
[3:02:30] <leith_aziz> Kage is so trash
[3:02:32] <%BusterRepukken> @TopTieramisu just dont jump at him ;)
[3:02:35] <andre11dr> @toptieramisu Not in 02
[3:02:39] <+Ultimate_Edge> Rugal got banned and threated against at real places. It's definitely Rugal LUL
[3:02:39] <dds333a> @busterrepukken yep, Rugal and Goenitz blew people wide open. Krizalid is also rough too
[3:02:42] <Arek_1> @alphalejandro Yup.
[3:02:53] <this_guy_115> Kriz is coolest KOF antag
[3:02:53] <deafmelone> I think Mukai is underated
[3:02:54] <+b_aleph> @Ultimate_Edge true
[3:02:56] <HeavyNorse> I honestly liked Saiki, but mostly because it's just more Ash.
[3:03:07] <%TopTieramisu> boss characters shouldn't be playable in the first place LUL
[3:03:13] <sonofthedeepsouth> Only cowards banned Rugal in the arcades
[3:03:16] <+b_aleph> Everyone knows a story about someone who was stabbed or something for picking Rugal
[3:03:17] <%TopTieramisu> unless they're balanced accordingly like seth
[3:03:21] <kikoeru_san> Saiki is cool, but his red boss form SUCKS
[3:03:28] <Zerotoad5> ^
[3:03:33] <leith_aziz> Is there an underrated KOF antagonist ? (explain what makes you like them. Im a newbie)
[3:03:37] <%BusterRepukken> @TopTieramisu I pick Omega Rugal in 98 every time, stop me
[3:03:39] <andre11dr> Yo Rugal in 95 is THE PROBLEM
[3:03:39] <kikoeru_san> One of THE worst designed bosses EVER
[3:03:39] <+b_aleph> Arcades were adult joints in latin america
[3:03:42] <$emptyantics> I hope we Sylvie in a NESTS costume for KOF XV
[3:03:52] <%TopTieramisu> oh yeah, rugal was in 98
[3:03:57] <%TopTieramisu> he wasn't too bad
[3:04:06] <HeavyNorse> I hope Yashiro returns. ♥
[3:04:09] <%BusterRepukken> cause 98 is called Dream Match Never Ends because its all in Shingos head.
[3:04:09] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> that was a smooth animation
[3:04:09] <plushysceptile> So do they know about Mr Karate in this game?
[3:04:13] <%TopTieramisu> orochi yashiro is my jam
[3:04:14] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1369188817492656132?s=19
[3:04:20] <dds333a> Mr. Big is kinda underrated, but I love his moves, especially his disco DM
[3:04:29] <andre11dr> I kinda want Spear lady back
[3:04:31] <%BusterRepukken> thats why Shingo is a mid boss in 98, its his dream lmao
[3:04:31] <$emptyantics> I was actually stabbed at an arcade is Mexico
[3:04:31] <kikoeru_san> I know Woolie knows they're in the game
[3:04:35] <Man_in_the_Red> nit sure if they even bought Team 15 dollar in this port
[3:04:38] <andre11dr> I think she was cool
[3:04:39] <%TopTieramisu> @andre11dr shion? because that's a dude
[3:04:42] <dds333a> @heavynorse hell yes
[3:04:46] <Man_in_the_Red> or... wait a sec
[3:04:47] <%jinking79> Shino a Guy
[3:04:57] <+b_aleph> @BusterRepukken I legit dreamed about Guilty Gear this night. But I already forgot what happened...
[3:04:58] <andre11dr> @toptieramisu What Shion is dude?
[3:05:02] <this_guy_115> Shion's a dude
[3:05:02] <%TopTieramisu> shion is great though
[3:05:05] <this_guy_115> LUL LUL LUL
[3:05:06] <%TopTieramisu> that fighting style was awesome
[3:05:12] <kikoeru_san> Do the EX version of that Takuma super
[3:05:14] <dds333a> @andre11dr always has been
[3:05:14] <$emptyantics> Shion’s great
[3:05:14] <alphalejandro> Shion?...the trap with the chinese spear in XI?
[3:05:21] <andre11dr> Why does he have a womans voice?
[3:05:22] <leith_aziz> I would stay, but Its getting very late on my side and I need to take a break. Thanks for the conversation, Chat
[3:05:23] <+Redvc> @alphalejandro Yes
[3:05:28] <plushysceptile> Got to hold down start/select like the old times. It's how you get OG Iori, NEST Kyo, and Mr Karate
[3:05:32] <andre11dr> And looks like a woman
[3:05:41] <andre11dr> I blame Falcon
[3:05:43] <%BusterRepukken> i hate NEST Kyo's look
[3:05:45] <%TopTieramisu> @andre11dr iunno. why does goku have a woman's voice
[3:05:45] <+b_aleph> Shion is a dude, Bao is a dude, Ash is a dude... get with the program!
[3:05:46] <this_guy_115> About half of the KoF cast know about Mr. Karate in 13, and the other half don't know who he is
[3:05:52] <Revzero25> @leith_aziz I don’t know if he’s underated, but love goenitz because he destroys kyo before 96 and that fight is the cannon reason why kyo fights differently
[3:05:53] <%jinking79> to give u the Weirdest Boner
[3:05:55] <HeavyNorse> Androgynous. Bishounen.
[3:05:59] <dds333a> @plushysceptile and the Orochi team in '02
[3:06:01] <+Ultimate_Edge> A lot of asian culture like androgynous designs
[3:06:15] <%BusterRepukken> hopefully Ryo has his Mr Karate design in 15, its his best look ever.
[3:06:17] <+Redvc> @andre11dr He was a girl until they decided to make him a dude until the last minute for some reason
[3:06:19] <this_guy_115> yeyeyeye
[3:06:26] <%Sparkseid> ooooo
[3:06:28] <Roasted_Pheasant> @Ultimate_Edge Androgyny is hot, they're right
[3:06:32] <dds333a> @b_aleph at least Bao never fooled me
[3:06:32] <%TopTieramisu> @Revzero25 and kenpo kyo is the fkin best
[3:06:34] <plushysceptile> @dds333a It's in 98 DM too. It's how you get alt/EX versions of other characters too
[3:06:35] <kikoeru_san> @this_guy_115 Kim is so happy to have the chance to fight Karate
[3:06:35] <alphalejandro> What was the name of the pink alien of XI?...Magaki?
[3:06:41] <Zerotoad5> Hold button keeps the input in the buffer a bit longer
[3:06:44] <kikoeru_san> It's so adorable
[3:06:48] <PMda2nd> 👀
[3:06:49] <Revzero25> @toptieramisu damn straight
[3:06:55] <%Dante_Namikaze1> @roasted_pheasant facts
[3:06:56] <dds333a> @plushysceptile yep, I know
[3:07:02] <+b_aleph> @dds333a I ws never fooled by any of them. But the arcsys ones? Damn...
[3:07:20] <%BusterRepukken> yeah EX Terry is FF 2 Terry
[3:07:22] <kikoeru_san> Nice
[3:07:25] <%jinking79> love to see Oswald again
[3:07:30] <%Sparkseid> woolieYE
[3:07:31] <%TopTieramisu> oswald is really cool too
[3:07:32] <andre11dr> Yeah Magaki sucks, he was just a lame Orochi
[3:07:37] <this_guy_115> FUN FACT: In the mobile version of 13, there was a specific shortcut button that could be pressed to do special moves, which MAJORLY streamlined the ability to do high tier combos like the ones shown in the videos
[3:07:45] <dds333a> @b_aleph Bridget is in another dimension
[3:07:48] <huskarl_zap> Jiyuna warned us about the koff trails but here we are
[3:07:52] <andre11dr> And i think Orochi is kinda lame in general
[3:07:59] <alphalejandro> Of course Woolie wil pick Shen Woo
[3:08:03] <%BusterRepukken> yes the REAL KOF 13 is the mobile version. play it or you're not a real fan.
[3:08:04] <dds333a> Aw yeah, herre we go.
[3:08:05] <+Ultimate_Edge> Selfishly wanting any thing representing Metal Slug in 15
[3:08:08] <kikoeru_san> Shen is this game's unga bunga imo
[3:08:15] <%TopTieramisu> shen woo always looked like some western tourist in asia
[3:08:23] <dds333a> Apply the buff, and Shen goes ham
[3:08:28] <+b_aleph> Local man too angry to die
[3:08:29] <%TopTieramisu> kinda put me off about him
[3:08:31] <$emptyantics> @ultimate_edge A girl can dream 🥲
[3:08:34] <huskarl_zap> Three asses a hand Terry Bogard is mobile canon terry
[3:08:35] <kikoeru_san> Get in the corner Shen goes ham
[3:08:42] <alphalejandro> Shen only punches thing really hard and wins
[3:08:44] <this_guy_115> Shen is just a chinese thug who's considered the DRAGON OF THE EAST or something like that
[3:08:48] <Revzero25> Which canon team do you guys like the most?
[3:08:52] <andre11dr> He's just fight man my power is that i punch you hard, i love him
[3:08:55] <this_guy_115> And yet he's SICK
[3:08:57] <BlackermanZX> Shen is so unga
[3:08:58] <%BusterRepukken> Terry's new super in KOF XV is him slapping your ass
[3:08:58] <$emptyantics> Shen is so fucking cool
[3:09:01] <+Ultimate_Edge> @emptyantics "Shatter your expectations" God I hope they do
[3:09:04] <+b_aleph> Shen is chinese counterculture
[3:09:10] <+Dova573> Shen "PEGALE DURO" Woo
[3:09:18] <dds333a> @revzero25 New Face, probably
[3:09:18] <alphalejandro> @Revzero25 Fatal Fury team i think
[3:09:24] <Chester_goes_Berserk> holy shit that hype girl in the background
[3:09:25] <kikoeru_san> This is what I deal with every week
[3:09:26] <huskarl_zap> @busterrepukken I would buy the most edition so fast if that were true.
[3:09:30] <+Ultimate_Edge> Gotta love this stage LUL
[3:09:30] <%TopTieramisu> if punch was a person
[3:09:32] <kikoeru_san> This fucking character
[3:09:41] <JdotSweapA> shen woooooooooooo~
[3:09:45] <dds333a> Oh yeah, Shermie's here in the background
[3:09:46] <$emptyantics> Shen “Chinga tu madre no vas a salir de esta esquina” Woo
[3:09:48] <%BusterRepukken> i see why Max loves Shen
[3:09:51] <huskarl_zap> Mabuchi?
[3:09:52] <%jinking79> god Billy just dies in 13 with his hitbox
[3:09:53] <Arek_1> FeelsAmazingMan
[3:09:53] <andre11dr> Yeah that's the combo you usually see
[3:09:59] <%BusterRepukken> Shen is another blonde UNGA character
[3:10:02] <+Redvc> Shermie sometimes appear in the background on this stage
[3:10:10] <FrostedZaibatsu> BBWs hggShaq
[3:10:12] <kikoeru_san> Lots of 236s Reggie
[3:10:14] <Pookiedaexzile> thiccy wit the hard head banging in the front
[3:10:15] <+Dova573> @emptyantics LuL
[3:10:17] <Revzero25> @dds333a who was in new face?
[3:10:21] <this_guy_115> FUN FACT, idk if its this stage but eagle-eyed viewers can sometimes see either Shermie or the Agent team hanging out in the background
[3:10:36] <+HolyGriddles> dooddood dooddood dooddood dooddood
[3:10:37] <this_guy_115> New Face team is Yashiro, Shermie, and Chris
[3:10:38] <alphalejandro> Shen is basically Yamazaki but without the Orochi thing in him
[3:10:42] <%BusterRepukken> Shingo is in the background sometimes, with his broken arm
[3:10:47] <huskarl_zap> Did you know you can see Shermie in this stage?
[3:10:49] <deafmelone> Shen Woo's design reminds me of Shenlong from Bloody Roar, im convinced he has a color based off his design from Bloody Roar 3
[3:10:54] <Revzero25> Ah ok
[3:10:54] <this_guy_115> New Face team is also called Orochi team
[3:11:02] <%jinking79> lots of cameos in 13 background
[3:11:21] <andre11dr> Also yeah i guess Shermie is just alive again now
[3:11:22] <%BusterRepukken> isnt Haohmaru in the background of a stage
[3:11:22] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:11:24] <+b_aleph> @alphalejandro No, Yamazaki is legit criminal evil. Shen was just raised in the streets
[3:11:31] <Revzero25> What was the name the team with shingo, kyo and iori. That one was my fav
[3:11:34] <HeavyNorse> Shermie would be cool too to have in KOFXV.
[3:11:41] <dds333a> what @this_guy_115 said, I used their team name in '97. it's the members of CYS. their orochi counterparts is the orochi team
[3:11:48] <kikoeru_san> You can see B. Janet in the London stage
[3:11:58] <Adwark> @alphalejandro Tho Yamazaki is like "kinda insane" where Shen is just "I like to fight" kind of what I recall
[3:12:10] <+b_aleph> Yamazaki is actually the 8th Hakkeshu, but mofo's so dangerous Goenitz just left him alone
[3:12:17] <this_guy_115> Ash's actions in this game caused New Face team to come back, since they all died in 97
[3:12:18] <Orizzonte_Vei> @heavynorse She's coming back in XV. It was confirmed months ago. The whole team is.
[3:12:22] <andre11dr> It would be cool is we saw what happens if Shermie became Orochi instead
[3:12:27] <huskarl_zap> You can see the ass slap event area in the chinese stage
[3:12:42] <HeavyNorse> @Orizzonte_Vei Confirmed how?
[3:12:46] <alphalejandro> What i mean is that they are like 2 "normal" guys with freaking powers
[3:12:53] <dds333a> @orizzonte_vei not explicitly confirmed, but likely
[3:12:55] <%BusterRepukken> Yamazaki has a super where he just stabs you with a switchblade.
[3:12:55] <kikoeru_san> HERE COMES THE BUNGA
[3:13:04] <Orizzonte_Vei> @heavynorse The Manga and the creator mentioned it.
[3:13:13] <huskarl_zap> @busterrepukken What a scamp
[3:13:22] <this_guy_115> Manga? You mean the Iori isekai manga?
[3:13:22] <+Redvc> Also Nakoruru is in the back in this stage
[3:13:24] <HeavyNorse> Oooohhh...
[3:13:29] <+b_aleph> @BusterRepukken that shit is waaaaay too big for a switchblade
[3:13:35] <%BusterRepukken> @huskarl_zap fuck your bodegas kid, die
[3:14:00] <dds333a> Weirdly enough, Yamazaki has a kinda tragic backstory. but dude is just an insane gangster/hitman who's only looking out for himself
[3:14:04] <%TopTieramisu> i feel like it's been a hot minute since the kof manga has been updated
[3:14:08] <andre11dr> Hawomaru also shows up in one of the backgrounds
[3:14:09] <%TopTieramisu> maybe the translation is lagging behind
[3:14:16] <%jinking79> got haohmaru and long hair Charlotte background
[3:14:17] <+captain_history> to be fair, XIV ending gives way for almost anyone who was dead to come back in XV
[3:14:29] <this_guy_115> I didn't even realize there was another KoF manga other than the isekai one
[3:14:41] <%TopTieramisu> the kof manga follows the current story arc
[3:14:44] <+b_aleph> @captain_history that was the idea
[3:14:45] <%TopTieramisu> with shun'ei
[3:14:51] <Orizzonte_Vei> They mentioned many bodies of people have resurfaced after verse exploded.
[3:14:52] <%TopTieramisu> and the art is frkin good
[3:15:09] <andre11dr> Man i really hope we someone else from Samsho than Nako in 15
[3:15:10] <alphalejandro> KOF A New Beginning, so cool
[3:15:14] <+b_aleph> There is a KOF manga that isn't Yuri and Friends? Nonsense!
[3:15:27] <andre11dr> It would be awesome to have Genjiro in KOF
[3:15:36] <%jinking79> Karmen and Mr Big making deal in one of the background
[3:15:54] <dds333a> @b_aleph SaigadoKreygasm
[3:16:13] <+captain_history> i would not be surprised for a Samsho team being the replacement for the Team Another World
[3:16:39] <+b_aleph> That one with Mai, Bao, Kensou and Chris is ridiculous
[3:16:54] <this_guy_115> WutFace
[3:16:55] <%BusterRepukken> so samsho characters get to be in a game with good netcoide lmao
[3:17:10] <%TopTieramisu> put shiki in kof
[3:17:11] <Adwark> @b_aleph bawkHm
[3:17:30] <+Ultimate_Edge> God. I would of bought every piece of dlc if it wasn't for Samshow's awful online
[3:17:35] <andre11dr> @busterrepukken And arguably better gameplay
[3:17:48] <%TopTieramisu> samsho's gameplay is great imo
[3:17:52] <%TopTieramisu> but that netplay
[3:17:55] <Reisadan> who is that guy in the background fanning?
[3:18:08] <dds333a> Mizuki was in Verse too, kinda interesting plothook
[3:18:10] <this_guy_115> It should have been Nezuna instead of Hibiki for the LB2 rep
[3:18:14] <Orizzonte_Vei> @toptieramisu I 2nd that.
[3:18:15] <alphalejandro> C'mon Woolie, learn how to unga with Shen already
[3:18:16] <andre11dr> Not that Samsho is bad i love Samsho but i do like the KOF speed more
[3:18:20] <%BusterRepukken> samsho 7 had the potential to be god tier cause the gameplay is great
[3:18:31] <lonosi55> does woolie know about the combo trials in this game or....?
[3:18:31] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:18:34] <%BusterRepukken> also deflecting someones blade and disarming them just hits another level of satisfying
[3:18:38] <+MikeNmurdoc> Hope everyone is having a great weekend atpHorns
[3:18:54] <dds333a> @reisadan he's just showing that Nippon spirit
[3:19:06] <%TopTieramisu> samsho and kof have different philosophies. they're just too different to compare. it just depends on what you appreciate
[3:19:06] <+Ultimate_Edge> It's just so solidly designed. Hurts even more knowing they're gonna get a Guilty Gear guest
[3:19:28] <this_guy_115> COOL MOVE
[3:19:33] <%mighty_max_t> mighty_max_t subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months! Aw, yeah. KOF 13, my intro to the franchise. Nice to see you guys and see this game. Hope you're doing alright!
[3:19:43] <%BusterRepukken> Nago in Samsho would fit, shame no one is gonna play it
[3:20:02] <%TopTieramisu> kof is so fast that it's a lot of just throwing out moves in neutral to shut out approaches whereas being reserved and methodical is more important in samsho
[3:20:08] <%BusterRepukken> i mean Nago is already a Samsho character anyway, he's slow, heavy damage and hes got a rage meter.
[3:20:20] <andre11dr> Samsho is like highest risk with the highest rewards, while KOF is just crazy movement and neutral and non stop oppression
[3:20:33] <+MikeNmurdoc> Idk why there's a KOF 13 resurgence, but i'm ALL about it
[3:20:36] <Orizzonte_Vei> It's a bit of a reach but I seriously hope they fix the net code for the next ten versions of Samsho.
[3:21:04] <%BusterRepukken> Samsho 2019 Perfect Special
[3:21:11] <Orizzonte_Vei> next gen*
[3:21:23] <this_guy_115> IORI
[3:21:39] <+b_aleph> If you could switch controls mid matches I would totally play Jhun
[3:21:41] <+Ultimate_Edge> Feel like they'll send code mystics on rollback for Samsho V before they do the current one. I have so little faith
[3:21:43] <huskarl_zap> One of those videos got deleted
[3:21:43] <dds333a> Oh god, I think I know who hes talking about
[3:21:48] <HeavyNorse> Which is better: Kyo with or without the headband?
[3:21:57] <Man_in_the_Red> @ultimate_edge thing is that already does

[3:22:17] <this_guy_115> yeyeyeyeyeye
[3:22:18] <%TopTieramisu> kyo doesn't need it. but i don't care either way
[3:22:19] <+MikeNmurdoc> Duo lon is so badass
[3:22:20] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> fantastic LUL
[3:22:20] <+Grayhammatter> WHAT
[3:22:23] <andre11dr> Oh i thought he was looking for Mr Karate, never mind

[3:22:40] <%Dante_Namikaze1> fucking what
[3:22:42] <HeavyNorse> @dds333a I'm just talking looks.
[3:22:45] <+MikeNmurdoc> atpSpiner
[3:22:47] <Orizzonte_Vei> I thought Samsho V special had rollback too??
[3:22:48] <huskarl_zap> that is out of control
[3:22:48] <dds333a> Oh, fuck I forgot, you'll see what he's talking about
[3:22:48] <%jinking79> 24 sec
[3:22:54] <+Rekinsinn> ????
[3:22:58] <+Ultimate_Edge> @Man_in_the_Red Thank you. I literally never saw this. I got something to play tomorrow!
[3:23:01] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> nice ass tho
[3:23:03] <Man_in_the_Red> Samsho V, Last Blade, Garou, and 2002UM
[3:23:04] <%BusterRepukken> yeah samsho v on steam has rolllback i think
[3:23:04] <whimsicallifestyle> kof speedrun glitch%
[3:23:06] <%TopTieramisu> uh
[3:23:06] <VirkaLlon> Wait, what!?!
[3:23:08] <dds333a> @heavynorse Oh, without
[3:23:08] <+MikeNmurdoc> you can charge his drop kick from the home screen
[3:23:10] <Zerotoad5> Raiden got nerfed for console
[3:23:13] <Man_in_the_Red> those are the ones that got the upgrade
[3:23:14] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[3:23:24] <dds333a> KEKW
[3:23:30] <%jinking79> Raiden players have not done a single kick he's loaded
[3:23:31] <Roasted_Pheasant> These are his trials, woolie
[3:23:36] <%gatorafan> Suddenly, THE BACKYARD
[3:23:47] <%TopTieramisu> SourPls
[3:23:48] <dds333a> CALL 'EM OUT
[3:23:52] <this_guy_115> Sourpls
[3:23:57] <Roasted_Pheasant> @WoolieVersus These are all his trials in trial mode
[3:24:03] <%wibbwobbler> ded
[3:24:07] <TheVoltStrike> what the fuck Raiden is cool??
[3:24:07] <Adwark> @Ultimate_Edge With new Sam Sho issue is that it's rather new 3D engine game - and NRS has done retrofit of Rollback in such situation with MKX. And it took A LOT of work.
[3:24:19] <%trustycoyote> I can't handle the opponent's sprite just spinning LUL
[3:24:30] <andre11dr> @woolieversus You should probably check out the Mr Karate stuff before his kinda the best caracter in the game and his damage is INSANE
[3:24:30] <Roasted_Pheasant> Oh yeah this shit gets dumb
[3:24:34] <%BusterRepukken> NRS retrofitting MK X with rollback cost like a million bucks, maybe more
[3:24:51] <Man_in_the_Red> most of the other characters look fine with the Speen
[3:25:07] <+HolyGriddles> MKX has rollback?!
[3:25:09] <dds333a> Big ups to snk bringing back OG FF characters Raiden and Hwa Jai. my pals couldn't believe it then
[3:25:13] <this_guy_115> He does a low air dive-kick lol
[3:25:14] <+Grayhammatter> delete that healthbar
[3:25:21] <Roasted_Pheasant> Jwong just got through the ingame trials. There are combos with 3 dropkicks
[3:25:24] <Roasted_Pheasant> It's fucking dumb
[3:25:25] <+Ultimate_Edge> Surely by now they see a bigger return of investment with rollback. So many people bought all the old games all over again for it.
[3:25:27] <%BusterRepukken> dont drop it
[3:25:28] <andre11dr> @holygriddles Yes it does
[3:25:29] <%jinking79> only 2 dropkicks aloud in a single match
[3:25:29] <HeavyNorse> MKX got GGPO a year into the game's life.
[3:25:37] <%gatorafan> @HolyGriddles yes, it got added on an update.
[3:25:37] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:25:42] <Adwark> @HolyGriddles It got added later after release after BIG amount of work, multiple months of work of bunch of NRS programmers. But it does have functional rollback.
[3:25:49] <Man_in_the_Red> @ultimate_edge oh they have, theyre trying to add it to 15
[3:25:50] <%BusterRepukken> yeah and retrofitting a 3d game with rollback costs a lot and it took them almost a year to do
[3:25:57] <Man_in_the_Red> keyword Trying
[3:26:16] <HeavyNorse> Any love for Duo Lon?
[3:26:21] <this_guy_115> IORI
[3:26:22] <Adwark> @Ultimate_Edge They officially confirmed they're designing KoF15 with rollback in mind.
[3:26:22] <+HolyGriddles> Time for a return to MKX I guess doodDerp
[3:26:26] <Roasted_Pheasant> I think the hardest Raiden Trial requires 4 separate drop kicks?
[3:26:28] <%BusterRepukken> @Man_in_the_Red I mean it will, they just say that for legal reasons.
[3:26:36] <%jinking79> and ppl land these combos online
[3:26:36] <+b_aleph> These combos are driving Max INSANE
[3:26:40] <lonosi55> Cause Nrs didnt understand what rollback is. it only took arika a few months plus being understaffed and zero budget. gtfo nrs
[3:26:46] <andre11dr> Also Elizabeth is really cool
[3:26:58] <+Ultimate_Edge> I'll stay cautious as SFV rollback was pretty shit, but I feel like I can actually be excited for it now lol
[3:27:05] <Zerotoad5> Beni loops ?
[3:27:06] <dds333a> @heavynorse Duo Lon, his oki was disgusting in XIII
[3:27:17] <+b_aleph> @jinking79 XIII is the most miserable online experience to get in. Ever.
[3:27:22] <Roasted_Pheasant> Desk? skaiEyes
[3:27:26] <%BusterRepukken> SFV wasn't made with rollback in mind originally. KOF 15 is being developed with it in early dev cycle.
[3:27:31] <Adwark> I sure do hope that SNK will be smart enough to at least consult with Code Mystics about how implementation of rollback should be working.
[3:27:38] <@Menitta> Who was that guy who did combo trick videos in shit like Double Dragon Neon
[3:27:39] <deafmelone> Found it the Raiden video
[3:27:41] <%TopTieramisu> sfv rollback was a false flag operation to sour the japanese devs to the concept of rollback
[3:27:56] <%jinking79> @b_aleph that's wat makes it crazy
[3:28:00] <+Ultimate_Edge> @TopTieramisu LUL
[3:28:04] <Man_in_the_Red> thanks Ono
[3:28:05] <%BusterRepukken> the earlier you work on rollback, the better it'll be
[3:28:07] <%jinking79> born in the Lag
[3:28:08] <Man_in_the_Red> you fuck
[3:28:12] <this_guy_115> KOF LORE: The Flying Brigand side arc starts with the leader Ron, betraying the clan and joining NESTS. one of the clan members, Lin, joins KOF 2000 and 01 to find Ron and stop him. After the nests arc one of Ron's sons, DUO LON, joins kof durimg the ash arc to find jim since he survived kof 2001
[3:29:03] <%TopTieramisu> the legendary jim
[3:29:05] <dds333a> I also knew a guy who started at XIII
[3:29:07] <andre11dr> @this_guy_115 But what's lore behind K999?
[3:29:19] <%TopTieramisu> k9999 is <redacted>
[3:29:28] <andre11dr> Oh wait, it's that they watched Akira
[3:29:31] <%TopTieramisu> but he was supposed to be another kyo clone
[3:29:32] <Adwark> @BusterRepukken As far I recall issue with SFV was mistaken choice that they wanted to set input delay at 0 frames.
[3:29:33] <this_guy_115> K9999(K-4-9) is the 9999th clone of K'
[3:29:37] <huskarl_zap> When's marspeople?
[3:29:39] <+Ultimate_Edge> Yeah just that they really loved Akira
[3:29:43] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Kreygasm separate soundtrack cd-s Kreygasm
[3:29:53] <+b_aleph> DAAAAAAN DAN DAN
[3:29:59] <Roasted_Pheasant> Duo Lon is like Dhalsim with rekkas
[3:30:00] <%NeonPopT> NeonPopT subscribed at Tier 3. They've subscribed for 3 months! oh do you now?
[3:30:02] <%BusterRepukken> 0 frames is a future we dont have yet.
[3:30:04] <dds333a> @huskarl_zap when the play SVC Chaos again
[3:30:12] <%TopTieramisu> angel
[3:30:13] <+MikeNmurdoc> rekka characters are all about feel to me
[3:30:14] <dds333a> Or NGBC
[3:30:18] <huskarl_zap> Angel
[3:30:20] <this_guy_115> K9999 is better than Nameless tbj
[3:30:23] <andre11dr> I love reca caracters
[3:30:33] <+MikeNmurdoc> @this_guy_115 big facts
[3:30:36] <%BusterRepukken> K9999 is never coming back, ever.
[3:30:43] <deafmelone> I found the persona world video
[3:30:45] <%TopTieramisu> k9999 is also a big copyright issue
[3:30:47] <this_guy_115> WutFace
[3:30:54] <Roasted_Pheasant> I would love if abel's low rekkas didn't suck
[3:30:54] <%TopTieramisu> because of his absurd similarities to to tetsuo
[3:30:54] <HeavyNorse> We got Nameless though...
[3:31:06] <%jinking79> u can grab Leo out of them
[3:31:10] <this_guy_115> The only thing nameless has going for him is the fact that he's voiced by Daisuke Ono
[3:31:16] <%BusterRepukken> oh the broken Raiden combos

[3:31:28] <%Dante_Namikaze1> @toptieramisu he was a straight up ripoff all the way to the fact that they got the voice actor who played him to do that character

[3:34:49] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[3:34:57] <Roasted_Pheasant> 3/4 LIFE OFF THREE DROPKICKS
[3:35:08] <rcand9> NONSENSE
[3:35:09] <%gatorafan> That's some Strive Sol Bullshit Blazing
[3:35:10] <+Ultimate_Edge> That dropkick is a gun
[3:35:17] <+captain_history> @HeavyNorse He got some stuff in XIV
[3:35:17] <sonofthedeepsouth> FAIR
[3:35:21] <sonofthedeepsouth> ONLY FAIRNESS
[3:35:23] <%gatorafan> Or well, at the point of the beta I guess May
[3:35:23] <huskarl_zap> Bulldoggin
[3:35:29] <%TopTieramisu> STAR FINGER
[3:35:31] <Roasted_Pheasant> There is no honest Raiden
[3:35:33] <rcand9> LUL
[3:35:51] <dds333a> The only honest Raiden is Big Bear
[3:35:56] <andre11dr> If you think that's cheap, you should see Karate ans Iori
[3:35:57] <deafmelone> Big Bear
[3:36:03] <HeavyNorse> What's the difference?
[3:36:16] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[3:36:19] <Roasted_Pheasant> But your fingers WILL hate you if you aren't used to holding turn punches
[3:36:26] <huskarl_zap> Take 40 hits < three touch drop kick combo
[3:36:41] <andre11dr> Iroi gets infinites if you're willing to mangle your hands
[3:36:42] <Zerotoad5> Ex Iori Karate Kim i want them to see
[3:36:57] <%rich_779> rich_779 subscribed with Prime.
[3:36:59] <%ken_kuma> ken_kuma subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 6 month streak!
[3:37:05] <Roasted_Pheasant> Dropkick takes 24 frames to charge
[3:37:38] <dds333a> On the mic, and everything, they really upped Raiden from then
[3:37:46] <%AlteisenReiseZ> D A M A G E.
[3:37:50] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[3:37:53] <Roasted_Pheasant> And this Dropkick used to be EVEN BETTER
[3:38:05] <%TopTieramisu> i like his slanted dab walk stance
[3:38:16] <andre11dr> Yeah this is the nerfed version
[3:38:29] <VirkaLlon> omg
[3:38:35] <Zerotoad5> Got nerfed for console LUL
[3:38:44] <%ken_kuma> I like your hair Reggie
[3:39:03] <andre11dr> K also got nerfed for console
[3:39:22] <andre11dr> Arcade version K was a problem
[3:39:34] <+Ultimate_Edge> Oh it can work if your willing to put your triggers to the kicks LUL
[3:40:01] <sonofthedeepsouth> enough
[3:40:01] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:40:08] <sonofthedeepsouth> he holds for enough time
[3:40:10] <%BusterRepukken> dropkick being plus 4 on block is nuts
[3:40:18] <%BusterRepukken> or was that the un-nerfed version
[3:40:18] <%jinking79> 24sec
[3:40:40] <Overlord_shippo> Wasn't Justin Wong struggling using Raiden's charge in combos
[3:40:49] <%jinking79> yep
[3:41:01] <%TopTieramisu> justin would use a character like this
[3:41:03] <Roasted_Pheasant> 18 seconds is the level 3 which juggles
[3:41:16] <sonofthedeepsouth> fuck off
[3:41:17] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[3:41:30] <Roasted_Pheasant> Just get good 4Head
[3:41:38] <dds333a> Charge the shit out of that button
[3:41:41] <andre11dr> What a bizarre choice Raiden and Hua Jai ,who the fuck
[3:41:52] <sonofthedeepsouth> yeah
[3:42:04] <sonofthedeepsouth> Mai mirror match?
[3:42:07] <sonofthedeepsouth> uh
[3:42:10] <Zerotoad5> Have you seen beni loops
[3:42:17] <%TopTieramisu> keeping it in the family, i see
[3:42:23] <+Tornix> beni throw loops are fun
[3:42:26] <FrostedZaibatsu> Hold charge while the game is still in development
[3:42:28] <Roasted_Pheasant> Beni can juggle with jumping fireball in the corner too
[3:42:30] <+Tornix> throw juggle*
[3:42:33] <PMda2nd> raiden threw that sht before he got in the room
[3:42:34] <andre11dr> Beni is so cool in this game
[3:42:38] <huskarl_zap> How does someone discover something like character select inputs?
[3:42:42] <+Chili_Daddy> everything is a loop
[3:42:52] <+Tornix> beni and kensou can juggle after throw in the corner
[3:43:02] <dds333a> Like I said earlier, big ups for snk putting them in. hope they put some more obscure picks, maybe some more AOF picks
[3:43:13] <%ken_kuma> Does 13 have rollback?
[3:43:13] <%trustycoyote> The good ole Prima guides
[3:43:14] <andre11dr> Beni can get combos after throw too
[3:43:18] <sonofthedeepsouth> the book
[3:43:20] <%BusterRepukken> no 13 does not have rollback
[3:43:21] <Roasted_Pheasant> @ken_kuma Unfortunately no
[3:43:24] <%Dante_Namikaze1> bring back cheat books
[3:43:27] <%ken_kuma> Daaaamn it
[3:43:29] <+Tornix> xiii has parsec Kappa
[3:43:36] <+Tornix> 97
[3:43:39] <@Solidus_113> Garou
[3:43:43] <+Ultimate_Edge> I wish 98 had it
[3:43:44] <+Chili_Daddy> 98um has it?
[3:43:47] <%ken_kuma> Fair nuff
[3:43:49] <Roasted_Pheasant> There aren't really cheat codes anymore, because companies started selling cheats as DLC
[3:43:50] <sonofthedeepsouth> what about 13 rollback mod?
[3:43:55] <%BusterRepukken> 98 UM needs it
[3:43:55] <dds333a> That's why Benimaru is almost Lways top tier
[3:44:02] <Orizzonte_Vei> @busterrepukken exactly
[3:44:09] <sonofthedeepsouth> where are the modders to put rollback in 13
[3:44:09] <FrostedZaibatsu> @sonofthedeepsouth lol thats not how that works dude
[3:44:16] <%LordSDB> Homing low kick!!! woolieCHAN
[3:44:30] <dds333a> Time for that oki
[3:44:30] <%ken_kuma> All 'bout that Blitz these days
[3:44:39] <%BusterRepukken> blitz netcode for KOF 13
[3:44:41] <%jinking79> if SNK released rollback on 13 after this month fuckit
[3:44:58] <HeavyNorse> That broken foot tho
[3:45:04] <this_guy_115> yeyeye
[3:45:07] <%TopTieramisu> duo lon is slick
[3:45:07] <%LordSDB> Also Each Promise is such a great theme song
[3:45:10] <+Tornix> I'm just glad he doesn't have infinite in this game
[3:45:12] <+MikeNmurdoc> Duo Lon's stanky leg has more swag than some games whole rosters LUL
[3:45:13] <$emptyantics> I always hated how he has one foot awkwardly up
[3:45:30] <this_guy_115> But that's the point, its a sort of ninja clan stance
[3:45:32] <+MikeNmurdoc> awkwardly?? boy thats drop!
[3:45:35] <+MikeNmurdoc> drip*
[3:45:52] <this_guy_115> also he's the son of a guy who can teleport with his SKELETON APPEARING FIRST
[3:45:54] <%ken_kuma> Dandy Step?
[3:46:40] <dds333a> @this_guy_115 pretty much, although other members of the Hizoku don't have that stance
[3:46:41] <andre11dr> So top five in this is Mr Karate ,Kim,Iori, Benimaru ,and then you can go Yuri or Kyo
[3:47:08] <+Ultimate_Edge> Duo Lon's foot just wants to keep you honest :)
[3:47:08] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:47:11] <BlackermanZX> I can never stop looking at the stanky leg
[3:47:20] <%TopTieramisu> stanky leg lives rent free
[3:47:26] <$emptyantics> Anyone have that sprite of Ryu Hayabusa someone modded on this game?
[3:47:40] <%ken_kuma> This banana shoe'd motherfucker has a Dandy Step? That

[4:18:58] <huskarl_zap> Team tiddie when?
[4:19:02] <KatyParry_FGC> mr karate higher though
[4:19:23] <+TrulyAmiracle> he's top, but not really. I can see like 8 chars above him
[4:19:31] <KatyParry_FGC> 8?
[4:19:36] <this_guy_115> wuh
[4:19:40] <KatyParry_FGC> that sounds inflated
[4:19:51] <OkamiDude15> Is woolie cumming in the sprites again?
[4:20:01] <KatyParry_FGC> is he doing what?
[4:20:04] <KatyParry_FGC> sirf?
[4:20:06] <KatyParry_FGC> sir*
[4:20:09] <OkamiDude15> On*
[4:20:10] <dds333a> crouching kick to take it
[4:20:11] <%TopTieramisu> that's not a bad ash palatte
[4:20:15] <KatyParry_FGC> the question remains
[4:20:27] <+FuqBoiSlim> this chat some freaks fr
[4:20:46] <FrostedZaibatsu> with the bitch slap
[4:20:49] <%TopTieramisu> yeah i don't even understand what that comment means
[4:21:03] <andre11dr> I'm just confused
[4:21:04] <dds333a> Kyo telling Ash to "get back here" is a pretty large part of the saga, so it works
[4:21:07] <OkamiDude15> Woolie likes the kof 13 sprites so I was wondering if he has been gushing about them a lot as I just got here
[4:21:20] <+thehotrefrigerator> I mean the sprites are really great
[4:21:23] <RodCU> yesss KOFXIII
[4:21:24] <+FuqBoiSlim> @okamidude15 oh yeah that was the pregame
[4:21:25] <%TopTieramisu> what a weird way to phrase that
[4:21:33] <floralkami> damn, Ralf buff af in this game
[4:21:34] <KatyParry_FGC> ahh i gotcha now
[4:21:40] <%BusterRepukken> Hollywood Hogan Ralf
[4:21:43] <+TrulyAmiracle> @KatyParry_FGC Karate Beni Kim EX Iori Yuri EX Kyo Chin are all better
[4:21:43] <Kogashiwakai> weird but not incorrect
[4:21:43] <sonofthedeepsouth> 5 bars
[4:21:47] <%nakunattakage> gushing and cumming aren't really synonymous and it'll make people do a double take, just for future reference, chat member
[4:21:50] <+heyitsdenzel_> shingo in the background
[4:21:56] <dds333a> @floralkami yeah. a bit too much
[4:22:04] <deafmelone> That was worded ... interestingly
[4:22:05] <floralkami> @nakunattakage bruh, what???
[4:22:07] <OkamiDude15> Wrong okami
[4:22:09] <huskarl_zap> Little girl murdered

[4:22:20] <andre11dr> @trulyamiracle I don't know i would argue about Chin
[4:22:23] <FrostedZaibatsu> she didnt deserve that
[4:22:24] <this_guy_115> ADELHEID yeye my man
[4:22:30] <%nakunattakage> @floralkami was talk about someone else, you're good :)
[4:22:33] <KatyParry_FGC> @TrulyAmiracle i sort of contest yuri being above him, but i accept that list
[4:22:34] <RodCU> Takuma with the Kenshin colors LUL
[4:22:36] <this_guy_115> He deserved to be in 13
[4:22:37] <%TopTieramisu> bring back adelheid
[4:22:43] <dds333a> Wasn't Hinako in that stage too. anyway, here's Sky Noah
[4:22:43] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:22:43] <BlackermanZX> Damn now i wanna play XIII
[4:22:50] <this_guy_115> 15 better have Adelheid
[4:22:50] <KatyParry_FGC> go play it
[4:22:51] <KatyParry_FGC> its on sale
[4:22:52] <+TrulyAmiracle> @andre11dr Chin is mad buff watchu mean. He's insane in this game
[4:22:55] <BlackermanZX> I used to run team triple K aka Ex Kyo, K' and King StinkyGlitch
[4:22:55] <KatyParry_FGC> $5 on fanatical
[4:22:59] <RodCU> @TopTieramisu he will be on the background again Kappa
[4:23:02] <dds333a> Damn
[4:23:20] <%BusterRepukken> I run the 3 Flames team of Kyo/Iori and K' in KOF games
[4:23:31] <floralkami> @nakunattakage oh i know, but it made me do that double take. i can't even find the context since i recently reloaded
[4:23:42] <andre11dr> @trulyamiracle I just feel like other characters get his damage for less efort
[4:23:47] <%nakunattakage> ah @floralkami someone just asked if woolie was cumming on the sprites LUL
[4:23:54] <sonofthedeepsouth> panther in the background just chilling
[4:24:01] <%BusterRepukken> thats Rose's panther
[4:24:24] <dds333a> I wonder if they named it. we had Rodem, I wonder what the kitten is called
[4:24:25] <KatyParry_FGC> why the piano have a tesla charger connected under it?
[4:24:25] <sonofthedeepsouth> the chad Rugal
[4:24:31] <floralkami> @nakunattakage UUUUUUUUGH sheepleDisgust LUL
[4:24:48] <+captain_history> yeah this is the Sky Noah
[4:24:52] <%nakunattakage> yeah LUL
[4:24:55] <+TrulyAmiracle> @andre11dr his strength is his mix, counters and his damage. Plus things like his throw in the corner he's nuts. Takuma needs a clean hit to get anything going and his mix is standard
[4:25:29] <lonosi55> Theyre not doing trials???
[4:25:31] <Iggysteve> chat he's been downloaded
[4:25:34] <dds333a> saw that coming with the jump Reggie
[4:25:36] <floralkami> "Hey Woolie, are you absolutely nutting on these sprites?"
[4:25:45] <+FuqBoiSlim> @lonosi55 they did that a minute ago
[4:25:45] <KatyParry_FGC> @floralkami LOL
[4:25:57] <huskarl_zap> LUL
[4:25:59] <+captain_history> I would like to see Adel in XV
[4:26:01] <%nakunattakage> LUL bro you got any figurines in jars?
[4:26:06] <sonofthedeepsouth> ralf comes to finish the job
[4:26:07] <sonofthedeepsouth> A LOT
[4:26:09] <huskarl_zap> BBM Ralf Kreygasm
[4:26:11] <andre11dr> Also i find King to be pretty up there in the tiers as well, she's super solid
[4:26:15] <+FuqBoiSlim> Not the jar...
[4:26:17] <floralkami> fml, the first thing i imagined was a render of Kyo's sprite in "The Jar"
[4:26:25] <+thehotrefrigerator> @nakunattakage This is a tough sentence to handle right now
[4:26:27] <floralkami> @FuqBoiSlim YOU TOO?
[4:26:35] <%nakunattakage> I think we gotta nuke chat just to be safe LUL
[4:26:36] <dds333a> @andre11dr she is. top tier zoning
[4:26:48] <+Ultimate_Edge> Got absolutely Ralf-ed
[4:26:51] <+b_aleph> Reggie hates Ralf
[4:26:56] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[4:27:00] <anarchistPastry> Reggie loves Ralf
[4:27:01] <+b_aleph> That's why Woolie always pick him
[4:27:05] <+FuqBoiSlim> Enough with the amateurs shofuBlam
[4:27:21] <%BusterRepukken> doesnt ralf have it back in 14
[4:27:22] <KatyParry_FGC> they traded ralfs grab for combos
[4:27:27] <KatyParry_FGC> i miss grab but i like this ralf
[4:27:27] <andre11dr> He has it in 14 right?
[4:27:29] <dds333a> Yeah, for real, now only clark has it
[4:27:31] <lonosi55> They did not do trials
[4:27:33] <+TrulyAmiracle> Nah
[4:27:33] <KatyParry_FGC> he does not @andre11dr
[4:27:34] <xUrbanCarnage> ralf smells
[4:27:39] <huskarl_zap> Mai,Angel,Leona Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[4:27:41] <lonosi55> they skipped trials LOL FailFish
[4:27:42] <andre11dr> Oh that sucks
[4:27:43] <+TrulyAmiracle> Ralf in 14 is trash
[4:27:43] <Gunnehsan> hey chat, what turns you off of KoF besides having to get a team together
[4:27:55] <dds333a> Then again, they used to be practically the same character in '94
[4:28:05] <this_guy_115> again, starting from 13 most of the character's movesets were simplified
[4:28:06] <KatyParry_FGC> @Gunnehsan ppl who only comment but dont play KOF
[4:28:12] <BlackermanZX> goddamn this game is fun
[4:28:21] <lonosi55> Team battles @Gunnehsan
[4:28:23] <andre11dr> 02 Ralph was best Ralph
[4:28:34] <KatyParry_FGC> 13 ralf best ralf
[4:28:37] <floralkami> @Gunnehsan frame canceling. i just can't wrap my head around the tightness of linking moves
[4:28:46] <Kogashiwakai> i played this game only using drive cancels at best, couldnt hd for shit but drive cancels were easy enough for me
[4:28:47] <+b_aleph> Clark is the best Ralf
[4:28:51] <KatyParry_FGC> LOL
[4:28:53] <KatyParry_FGC> Damnit
[4:28:55] <KatyParry_FGC> he's right
[4:28:57] <+TrulyAmiracle> @this_guy_115 They had to man, 2k2 movelists were basically maxed out lol
[4:29:03] <andre11dr> @b_aleph Too true
[4:29:10] <this_guy_115> I want 14 ralf with 98's supers, no more charge character
[4:29:11] <+nooshy1> 11 Ralf is best Ralf. Before Clark STOLE HIS ARMORED COMMAND GRAB.
[4:29:27] <dds333a> Yeah, like I said before, and other people were bringing up good points, kof, isn't "hard", but it is a kinetic, precise game, with mutiple tools for approach, and rolls and whatnot
[4:29:32] <GlaiveMaiden> btw if you haven't been told already Ichiban was the name of the lipstick Joey did a commercial for on Friends and it's shameful that i remember that
[4:29:59] <andre11dr> 11 is a really interesting game
[4:29:59] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1369188817492656132?s=19
[4:30:03] <+b_aleph> KOF XIII IS the hardest KOF game tho
[4:30:10] <+TrulyAmiracle> Yes
[4:30:22] <KatyParry_FGC> lies
[4:30:24] <+TrulyAmiracle> I hate the xiii trials trend so much
[4:30:28] <KatyParry_FGC> 13 is the 2nd easiest KOF
[4:30:32] <KatyParry_FGC> dont lie to the ppl dem
[4:30:41] <%mtlsars> beautiful entertaining game though
[4:30:42] <dweebenheimer20> 2002 UM is harder than 13 imo
[4:30:45] <+TrulyAmiracle> whats the first?
[4:30:51] <KatyParry_FGC> 14 is the easiest KOF
[4:30:52] <%BusterRepukken> 14
[4:30:53] <KatyParry_FGC> hands down
[4:30:58] <floralkami> @dweebenheimer20 same
[4:31:02] <Kogashiwakai> I started with 13 and have having trouble doing basic shit in 02 for sure
[4:31:08] <Gunnehsan> scrub vs scrub is fun to me in KoFXIII
[4:31:09] <+TrulyAmiracle> yeah just wanted to see your answer
[4:31:11] <RodCU> the easiest KOF is the Rumble fighters
[4:31:13] <Alias_McDoe> 2k2UM has very little hard things execution wise
[4:31:14] <+TrulyAmiracle> 14 is mad easy
[4:31:23] <%mtlsars> too bad KOF just isnt as popular in North America
[4:31:28] <KatyParry_FGC> ^
[4:31:32] <+b_aleph> WHachu talking about, 02UM is the second easiest
[4:31:34] <KatyParry_FGC> rollback in 13 could change that
[4:31:36] <andre11dr> Like 11 waa tag game and it had some weird mechanics that kinda got refined later, but still the roaster in 11 was really interesting with some guests they brought like Guytendo
[4:31:40] <Edjager97> wait, wait, wait, is Woolie going to do KOF trials?!
[4:31:40] <+TrulyAmiracle> if rollback actually makes it in 15 it'll be bigger
[4:31:43] <+b_aleph> I think we all can agree that XIV is the easiest tho
[4:31:43] <KatyParry_FGC> rollback and lobbies in 13 would be legit
[4:31:47] <%BusterRepukken> well since KOF 15 will have rollback, Latin America will wash over everyone like a tide. Bad netcode held them back.
[4:31:54] <Annat3l> this is gonna be an oddly specific question, but is Andy's hcf kick cancel thing easier to do consistently in 14 than it is in 13?
[4:31:59] <BlackermanZX> 2002 UM has harder links though. Max mode canceling is so goddamn hard in that game
[4:32:00] <Kogashiwakai> god if 13 got rollbback...dont make me hope katy
[4:32:01] <%Dante_Namikaze1> @mtlsars yeah most people here think it's that weird mexican fighting game
[4:32:07] <KatyParry_FGC> @Annat3l nope
[4:32:13] <+nooshy1> XIII actually holds your hand a lot. One of the few with a full tutorial, and trials that show you the system pretty in depth. You just have to be willing *to put in the work.*
[4:32:16] <this_guy_115> Bro you can FEEL the mexican energy in 02 UM's online
[4:32:16] <KatyParry_FGC> @Annat3l imo they ruined that cancel
[4:32:19] <Alias_McDoe> XIV could be among the hardest, it's just that MAX dumbs things down.
[4:32:20] <dweebenheimer20> @BlackermanZX exactly
[4:32:23] <+TrulyAmiracle> @Annat3l you talkin about the break?
[4:32:27] <andre11dr> I think 02 ia harder
[4:32:27] <this_guy_115> They're too stronk
[4:32:30] <Annat3l> yeah
[4:32:38] <+TrulyAmiracle> you can buffer it and hold the break input
[4:32:41] <+Tornix> max mode isn't really necessary in 02UM unless you're using nameless tho
[4:32:45] <%trustycoyote> @KatyParry_FGC With rollback and the fact that you can pick it up on the cheap, it could bring a good amount of new people
[4:32:49] <Annat3l> orly
[4:32:52] <KatyParry_FGC> @Annat3l its not the most useful gimmick but in 13 after the break you can run forward, reset the opponent and crossunder with elbow for a mixup
[4:32:54] <+Ultimate_Edge> 13 Max mode autorunning you forward makes it easier to me than 2002
[4:32:55] <+b_aleph> @Tornix this
[4:32:56] <+TrulyAmiracle> like do hcf+K and immediately hold the roll
[4:33:01] <+TrulyAmiracle> it'll break everytime
[4:33:02] <BlackermanZX> In XIII at least they made the Max mode combos a bit easier
[4:33:05] <KatyParry_FGC> @Annat3l in 14 you cant crossunder so its really basic
[4:33:09] <RodCU> What's that thing about KOFXIII not working on big hard drives?
[4:33:15] <%mtlsars> which as a shame because the sheer quality of character design as far as fighting game mechanics is impeccable and up there with the best of them
[4:33:17] <RodCU> I remember woolie mentioning it on a podcast
[4:33:18] <+b_aleph> You can't play XIII on hig level without max mode, but you totally can play 02UM
[4:33:19] <KatyParry_FGC> we dont know @RodCU
[4:33:20] <andre11dr> @tornix Kyo gets some cool shot with reca loops
[4:33:33] <Annat3l> @KatyParry_FGC @TrulyAmiracle thanks for the info!
[4:33:35] <lonosi55> Yeah we not even listening to wahtever wools is talking about rn Lol
[4:33:37] <RodCU> @KatyParry_FGC I assume a disk partition solves that
[4:33:55] <KatyParry_FGC> @RodCU its not that the game doesnt work but replays have issues for some reason
[4:34:01] <RodCU> ah!
[4:34:06] <%BusterRepukken> @lonosi55 dude what is your issue
[4:34:09] <sonofthedeepsouth> But I really want to be an asshole
[4:34:12] <BlackermanZX> in short don't be a shitstain StinkyGlitch
[4:34:12] <KatyParry_FGC> some KOF games have strange glitches on PC
[4:34:13] <dweebenheimer20> fuck "scenes" and just play what you enjoy lol
[4:34:18] <sonofthedeepsouth> Let me be an Asshole
[4:34:19] <Gunnehsan> if you're a grappler user, KoF grapplers will fascinate you
[4:34:25] <KatyParry_FGC> like KOF 14 shows up really dark by default when you stream it.
[4:34:28] <Gunnehsan> much more aggressive
[4:34:30] <LilRamza> man putting rollback in XIII must sound like a nightmare cause of the backgrounds
[4:34:33] <+b_aleph> Strive will bring GG to 1st!
[4:34:41] <+Ultimate_Edge> King of Dinosaur > every other grappler
[4:34:47] <%jinking79> don't be the root that ruin the game u love

[4:35:19] <+Ultimate_Edge> @KatyParry_FGC Actually genius
[4:35:20] <RodCU> @KatyParry_FGC that would be dope
[4:35:21] <Draco_Renegade> Tell them to make Persona 5 Arena
[4:35:21] <Man_in_the_Red> Virtua Fighter beats Tekken to first 3D fighter with Rollback LUL
[4:35:33] <Man_in_the_Red> imagine
[4:35:34] <KatyParry_FGC> VF5 being played with ps3 emu for now
[4:35:37] <DSD24> We do it!
[4:35:38] <Tracazoid> The last half hour of Yakuza 7 after they've put the 13 hours in should just be Woolie teaching Little V Virtua Fighter.
[4:35:39] <+b_aleph> P5A, YES! PLEASE!
[4:35:39] <%gatorafan> @Man_in_the_Red But Tekken already has rollback Kappa
[4:35:41] <+Tornix> Harada says T7 already has rollback Kappa
[4:35:41] <BlackermanZX> speaking of surveys i hope friggin Atlus ports 13 sentinels to something after their survey
[4:35:45] <+b_aleph> BBCT SUCKS!!!
[4:35:50] <KatyParry_FGC> pleas keep making trial videos
[4:35:51] <FrostedZaibatsu> Forget Rollback, Blitz netcode is where its at
[4:35:52] <Man_in_the_Red> oh thats right, Tekken is 3
[4:35:55] <+TrulyAmiracle> Nooooo
[4:35:56] <KatyParry_FGC> it helps increase interest
[4:35:58] <%mtlsars> salt sure is fun
[4:36:01] <Man_in_the_Red> i did not read that well
[4:36:03] <RodCU> FrostedZaibatsu nooo
[4:36:08] <%mtlsars> through the eyes of someone else at least lol
[4:36:18] <lonosi55> If you think T7 doesnt have rollback then you probably dont know what Rollback is LMAO LUL
[4:36:20] <+Grayhammatter> Blitz netcode when?
[4:36:26] <RodCU> it's all about the delay netcode + wifi, better than offline Kappa
[4:36:36] <+TrulyAmiracle> I wish they'd at least learn the hold trick before doin trials
[4:36:44] <andre11dr> This game at high level is the most hype game to watch in my opinion
[4:36:46] <Alias_McDoe> I've seen so many people in chats saying "this is why I don't play KOF" in those trial videos
[4:37:00] <KatyParry_FGC> they were never interested
[4:37:00] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:37:05] <BlackermanZX> cowards all of them wooliePOYO
[4:37:06] <Edjager97> @Alias_McDoe true but that's theirfault
[4:37:09] <KatyParry_FGC> or they pussy @Alias_McDoe
[4:37:23] <Alias_McDoe> yeah but if you want to get more people that doesn't really help
[4:37:28] <BlackermanZX> So whens Annie and Skullgirls tho
[4:37:28] <+b_aleph> @Alias_McDoe Jwong is gatekeeping harder than the community itself
[4:37:34] <KatyParry_FGC> but since all the trial vids and ppl discovering XIII on xbox. a lot of new ppl have been trying to stream XIII
[4:37:38] <KatyParry_FGC> thats a great thing
[4:37:39] <andre11dr> Like XIII and Xrd are easily my favorite games to watch at high level ever
[4:37:52] <lonosi55> Tbf not even woolie wanted to play the trials in this game LUL
