[0:15:04] <%Doplghost> you can show the fruit of your efforts
[0:15:25] <CyrusVGZ> Then you play an actual game and the muscle memory Scott Pilgrims out the window.
[0:15:33] <newt_themoragsimp> This game looks really good for something that came out so many years ago.

[0:16:29] <+Clundy> Fahk
[0:16:31] <+ggbhtg> Why WOULDN'T Woolie play Vergil?!
[0:16:33] <%Doplghost> feb 2011 then nov 2011
[0:16:36] <Kei_Ar_> legit was about to uninstall cause i figured no ones online
[0:16:37] <TheArrow_> almost two consoles ago
[0:16:53] <Ultimatefool> @Clundy You old, all those years you forgot LUL
[0:16:54] <%Irridium> oh god I'm gonna get bodied so hard. fuck.
[0:16:55] <gordieda20> BIONIC ARRRRRRM
[0:17:10] <%redhotdivekick> Why must MVC be dead ;-; I wish for a new, good Mahvel every day
[0:17:12] <ProxyDoug> So weird to see Doom without his skirt
[0:17:18] <%ChoculaUltra> last week they were rusty, but now they got their bnbs down pat
[0:17:23] <%Doplghost> how different Marvel comics was compared to Marvel infinate when they wanted to base it more off the movies
[0:17:35] <extradopeness> It’s great to see woolie playing the same team after all these years
[0:17:38] <heartlesshealer> skirt? I always thought Doom was just wearing a tunic
[0:17:54] <alephalpha> it's a tunic
[0:17:59] <%ChoculaUltra> Doom dresses in drag as he pleases!
[0:17:59] <%Doplghost> it is a tunic
[0:17:59] <antyriku2> vergils block animation is real nice
[0:18:02] <%FuqBoiSlim> Doom was wearing the Hero of Time fit LUL
[0:18:12] <+Clundy> I thought it was a tabard?
[0:18:17] <%mighty_max_t> my main thing is why does MVCI have to be 50gb? if it was like 20, I could just leave it installed but man, that's too big
[0:18:28] <%ChoculaUltra> it's definitely more of a tabard thing
[0:18:32] <thatangryguyofde> The irony of spencer being loved in this game, but his last game was like 20K copies sold lytROLLWIP
[0:18:39] <%FuqBoiSlim> why on earth is a fighting more than 20gb?
[0:18:44] <alephalpha> suprised you don't play zero woolie
[0:18:55] <ProxyDoug> It's so weird to see Doom with booty shorts
[0:19:00] <%threecheats> woolieGASM
[0:19:03] <%Doplghost> people fell in lovem with that Spencer design after marvel 3, but before then it was disliked greatly
[0:19:08] <asurasmath> the loops
[0:19:14] <%ChoculaUltra> iirc, this is the Doomwar Armor he had when he rendered all Vibranium on the planet inert
[0:19:19] <theobble> GRABBITY SQUEEB
[0:19:20] <heartlesshealer> subligars are just weird superhero standard for outfits
[0:19:20] <%redhotdivekick> SQUEEZE THAT BITCH
[0:19:22] <extradopeness> Doom nooooo
[0:19:23] <Pechugaman> tekken is 70 gigs tho
[0:19:28] <%Doplghost> because that game came out around the same time as Bionic Commando Rearmed
[0:19:29] <gordieda20> GRAVITY SQUEEZEE

[1:03:52] <+linkwolf4> Anchor wright is fucking cursed

[1:04:18] <KeiPrime> fields2Swag
[1:04:19] <+linkwolf4> lytBODIED lytAGH
[1:04:23] <%Doplghost> MVC1 Ryu was the best
[1:04:31] <%Heefnoff> I love how Lythero plays 4 characters and Reggie just picked 3 of them
[1:04:34] <%Doplghost> spend meter to turn in to Ken or Akuma
[1:04:34] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:04:35] <%FuqBoiSlim> this was the biggest play IF got until the Netflix show lmao
[1:04:44] <%SinisterBroccoli> I love super skrull
[1:04:45] <%Heefnoff> And that show sucked :(
[1:04:47] <KeiPrime> super skrull is kinda sick
[1:04:48] <%SinisterBroccoli> such a cool choice
[1:05:02] <HereComestheChief> SourPls
[1:05:02] <%Heefnoff> For sure! Such a cool character
[1:05:02] <%FuqBoiSlim> this roster was pretty ahead of the curve now that I think about it
[1:05:07] <MegaQuint> SHE LOVES ME
[1:05:09] <%SinisterBroccoli> another FF character cooler than the FF
[1:05:11] <KidKaiser23> Super Skrull is the only mirror match we need in the future of the MCU
[1:05:38] <%koolaid_kevster> Bro woolie you see you got paper Mario ported to the switch good work! thought I'd tell you cause Nintendo wasn't woolieLORE
[1:05:39] <%Doplghost> I remember people hating that Rocket Raccoon was in this game when the ultimate roster was leaked
[1:05:40] <+logoth_> Man there's a lot of voices in this game
[1:05:50] <+logoth_> advancing guard advancing guard aircombo
[1:05:55] <%SvenHolgersson> Need to start getting back into this game
[1:06:01] <%Heefnoff> They were like “Who? Rocket who?”
[1:06:02] <%SvenHolgersson> The roster is just so FRESH
[1:06:02] <Man_in_the_Red> so if i was to run Felicia-Magneto, who would make a good 3rd pick in UMVC3
[1:06:03] <Viewtiful_Rose> Viewtiful Joe is like my favourite character design ever. But that’s kinda obvious given my name
[1:06:13] <%Heefnoff> Always Vergil @man_in_the_red
[1:06:20] <FacetiousAF> hi chat
[1:06:22] <%Doplghost> more like "who is this knockoff star fox character"
[1:06:32] <HereComestheChief> lytBODIED lytBODIED lytBODIED
[1:06:33] <newt_themoragsimp> If you wanna tons of voices during combat, play xenoblade, Logoth
[1:06:33] <%MarkTarkus> @Man_in_the_Red Vergil or Wesker
[1:06:40] <KidKaiser23> @man_in_the_red Vergil or Zero, but Captain is you feelin nasty 👅
[1:06:47] <%SinisterBroccoli> Viewtiful Joe always reminds me of Nanimon from digimon
[1:06:51] <+xerotwo> I N F E R N O O O O O doodCrazy
[1:06:52] <%SinisterBroccoli> lol
[1:06:53] <%Doplghost> Super Skrull is such a sleeper pull though
[1:07:02] <%Doplghost> much better then the fantastic 4
[1:07:06] <Viewtiful_Rose> I only know about Rocket before the movie cuz of wiki diving back in that day on the marvel wiki
[1:07:21] <%Taglog7> Kreygasm functions
[1:07:22] <Man_in_the_Red> tine to see what doodwesker 's got
[1:07:25] <%SvenHolgersson> SCARRY TEETH
[1:07:27] <KidKaiser23> Would love to see Super Skrull vs Miles Morales in the comics soon
[1:07:29] <Shardlab> It's the Worldbreaker. That's yo' ass
[1:07:40] <FacetiousAF> you're weak DansGame
[1:07:44] <BalloniWright> I love Joe's Casual look so much
[1:07:46] <+xerotwo> I N F E R N O O O O O doodCrazy
[1:07:50] <%SinisterBroccoli> I fucking love the FF if only cuz their villains are the actual best
[1:08:06] <KidKaiser23> Hulk has great enamel
[1:08:11] <%MTLer> Reggie stop sandbagging
[1:08:12] <KeiPrime> H E L O V E S Y O U

[1:08:20] <%Doplghost> Reed Richards coming in with the wooden gun tec
[1:08:23] <%FuqBoiSlim> Yeah, Paste Pot Pete is the coolest Kappa
[1:08:36] <mr_sups> Super Skrull is voiced by Cow and Chicken
[1:08:46] <Man_in_the_Red> i played the silver surfer NES game out of morbid curiousity if that counts
[1:08:56] <%Doplghost> channel your inner Brazilian
[1:09:06] <KidKaiser23> I remember the Silver Spooner if that counts
[1:09:18] <%FuqBoiSlim> most of my FF knowledge comes from the cartoon that aired on nicktoons tbh
[1:09:18] <%Doplghost> coolest level 3

[1:10:18] <%SinisterBroccoli> Was he never in a marvel game?
[1:10:23] <%Heefnoff> Nope
[1:10:30] <%Heefnoff> He really should be though, him and Rashid
[1:10:31] <%SinisterBroccoli> that's seems weird to think
[1:10:39] <newt_themoragsimp> If they could iplement phoenix wright, silver surfer could find a way

[1:10:42] <%Doplghost> the only 3rd strike character in a vs game was Alex in TVC
[1:10:43] <+Ryrob35> Rashid was a great character
[1:10:44] <Man_in_the_Red> Super Surfer would play like Touhou antimoney of common flowers, downward jumps, floaty dashes
