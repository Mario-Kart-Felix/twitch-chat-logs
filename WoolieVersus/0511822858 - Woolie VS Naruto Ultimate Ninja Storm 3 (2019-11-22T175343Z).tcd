[0:26:11] <%johnny_gogo> YO I LOVE GHETTO STREM
[0:26:13] <redrins> wasnt it on the vita?
[0:26:20] <mayorrev> BibleThump
[0:26:21] <kennyfz> This is (Madden) Town
[0:26:26] <+NYCrownlessKing> cody and guy were also in the trailers before release but were dlc @WoolieVersus
[0:26:31] <Serge_12> Those SF X Tekken trailer were so hype! I can only imagine you going nutz!
[0:26:32] <Morning_Asakura> the promotional material for sfxt was the best
[0:26:40] <%CaptainPileDriver> RUFUS VS BOB AND ZANGIEF VS JULIA
[0:26:47] <%CaptainPileDriver> that trailer is the best
[0:26:48] <+Superbro64> fun fact, if you are spending to long in the practice mode, Dan will come on screen and tell you that you can purchase easy move input gems to make the hard combos easier @woolieversus
[0:26:49] <%masterpiecejeremy> marketing is an art in its own right. that shit game was worth it just for the trailer
[0:26:49] <FockHead> I want Tekken x SF to still happen. Damn that game would be cool
[0:27:01] <HollowMan190> money well spent
[0:27:05] <kennyfz> Can't wait for Tekken X Street Fighter tho
[0:27:07] <+Superbro64> the easy move input gems were dlc, not with the base game
[0:27:09] <hassanico2> Yo chat I just showed up is Nardo dead?
[0:27:10] <kiharakun> @WoolieVersus what about the rise against trailer?
[0:27:13] <redwilt> NotLikeThis
[0:27:14] <+ZeroXI> window update!
[0:27:16] <%CaptainPileDriver> HEY REGGIE, JUST LIKE IN SFV ryu get's his ass kicked in
[0:27:21] <FockHead> Oh dip
[0:27:25] <%CaptainPileDriver> in the sfxt
[0:27:26] <Kirby_Sauce> Oh oh
[0:27:28] <%CaptainPileDriver> trailer
[0:27:37] <Graxe_> They're stalling for time to get past the eventual VoD muting at the start of the stream
[0:27:39] <blue6sub6remnant6> We got Akuma in Tekken.
[0:27:40] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[0:27:42] <+CoronetChris> You might have to suffocate the laptop... that's what I call shutting it off manually.
[0:27:46] <blue6sub6remnant6> More may happen.
[0:27:48] <OldManDeckardCain> half life is coming out so who knows what happens Kappa
[0:27:49] <hassanico2> @Graxe_ ah thank you
[0:27:49] <lordsdb> He didn't say cancellled but Tekken 7 is doing wsy to well right now to shift gears
[0:27:51] <FockHead> Akuma in Tekken 7 makes me absolutely thirsty for that game. A whole game built around that would be so sick
[0:27:52] <hassanico2> !uptime
[0:27:53] <Dragon_Batman> Tekken 7 is kind of a testing point with Akuma and Geese at the very least
[0:27:53] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 27 minutes and 55 seconds
[0:27:54] <+NYCrownlessKing> i mean i remember harada saying he'll get into TxSF but like T7 is just too hot right now @WoolieVersus
[0:28:06] <Serge_12> Should Tekken X SF just use the same trailer for hype!? Kappa Kappa
[0:28:06] <KeiPrime> its been like 7 or 8 years since sf x tekken
[0:28:14] <KeiPrime> ALMOST A DAMN DECADE
[0:28:15] <+NYCrownlessKing> but heard akuma and other guest characters were like "testing" the waters for the future of TxSF
[0:28:18] <%CaptainPileDriver> you mean the Pakistani best character in that scene
[0:28:33] <FockHead> Also the fact both Nintendo and Namco Bandai made Capcom vs SNK happen before Capcom or SNK lol
[0:28:34] <%CaptainPileDriver> what about negan
[0:28:35] <+Superbro64> at the last we heard, it was 40% done, and Harada mentioned at Tekken 7 season 2, if there was any point to continue development, as tekken is doing very well
[0:28:37] <blue6sub6remnant6> >>Reggie mad at Arslan and his posse.
[0:28:41] <mankeyfigh> BACK IN
[0:28:44] <KeiPrime> it doesnt have to happen anymore tekken 7 is the real capcom vs snk 3
[0:28:44] <%CaptainPileDriver> is negan amazing?
[0:28:48] <ShawnEXE> everything! Except netcode
[0:28:59] <fist_wizard_jay> Im surprised Negan turned out so well
[0:29:03] <zenith0111> @captainpiledriver Every character has some bullshit LUL
[0:29:09] <ittla> whens Capcom VS
[0:29:10] <%CaptainPileDriver> that's true
[0:29:13] <fist_wizard_jay> Also
[0:29:15] <zenith0111> That's why it's so good
[0:29:17] <Dragon_Batman> Negan is pretty good weirdly enough
[0:29:20] <%johnny_gogo> anyone else hearing the light ringing sound
[0:29:24] <gammongaming11> hey regie looks nice, did he go on a diet?
[0:29:27] <fist_wizard_jay> Akuma using GUN is the funniest fucking shit
[0:29:29] <niddron> Yo! finally caught a stream!
[0:29:30] <zenith0111> @johnny_gogo 👍
[0:29:30] <kennyfz> What if TXSF was named something else?
[0:29:30] <sphereshots12> Or TT3
[0:29:34] <+NYCrownlessKing> that game was dead at this point competitively.
[0:29:38] <WanderingSwordsman> I hear the game audio
[0:29:39] <bitterssweets> near the end of season 3 for tekken Negan will be the next OP character, watch
[0:29:39] <%CaptainPileDriver> injustice 2 killed injustice 1 until people got sick of the fucking GEAR LOOT BOXES
[0:29:40] <Morning_Asakura> that's just fightning games
[0:29:42] <redrins> that really depends on the community
[0:29:46] <SuperKirby24> Use Tekken X SF as a beta for Tekken 8 lol
[0:29:54] <Needwagon_for_speedwagon> We back on the "fuck Sasuke" train?
[0:29:56] <FockHead> Oh right, how do you guys feel about SF5 Championship Edition?
[0:29:59] <ittla> people are still playing SFxT
[0:30:07] <KeiPrime> as a joke
[0:30:10] <blue6sub6remnant6> @Needwagon_for_speedwagon Were we ever off?
[0:30:11] <fist_wizard_jay> The Warriors
[0:30:11] <+Superbro64> publishers prefer you to consume product and then be excited for next product
[0:30:19] <+heartbbyy> third strike is still a thing and always will be
[0:30:20] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus gotta ask again, you going to frosty faustings? cause shit i'm driving down to that later
[0:30:21] <MemoryOfDust> tekken 8? for real? when T7 is still getting big support?
[0:30:26] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @kennyfz
[0:30:30] <%CaptainPileDriver> 7 hour drive
[0:30:43] <+medinaj1990> I love consuming next product
[0:30:43] <Serge_12> Yeah, What are your thoughts on SF5 Championship Edition?
[0:30:48] <gammongaming11> @WoolieVersus do you think steam remote play together will help games with bad netcode or dead servers?
[0:30:49] <bitterssweets> Tekken 8 wont happen until 2022
[0:30:49] <SomersaultJustice> did woolie figure it out?
[0:30:50] <+gustavozxd> I have a friend that was playing ps3 sf4 a couple of months ago and still getting matches, dunno how many but the fact there was anyone playing that game on the PS3 is pretty crazy
[0:30:51] <kennyfz> I tend ti forget caps on, sorry
[0:30:55] <dundore77> unless its Melee
[0:31:03] <Serge_12> Min and Reggie, thoughts on SF5 CE?
[0:31:04] <+Spankys_Pizza> I wanna see something goofy again like that Divekick game
[0:31:09] <Kirby_Sauce> Legally marry the fighting game
[0:31:09] <%CaptainPileDriver> WHEN'S NIDHOGG NIGHT
[0:31:10] <fist_wizard_jay> Wonder if they plan on adding new characters to SFV or if Gill was the last
[0:31:18] <blue6sub6remnant6> @dundore77 Melee players, as a collective, are an abusive husband.
[0:31:19] <+Superbro64> this is why we need ROLLBACK NETCODE, so that old games can continue to play well @woolieversus
[0:31:19] <GKannel> AS A SMASHER
[0:31:23] <Dutchpotato> What’s that humming?
[0:31:25] <zenith0111> @gustavozxd Dude some people are still playing Guilty Gear Rev 2 on ps3 LUL
[0:31:29] <Needwagon_for_speedwagon> "Moved on from Melee"
[0:31:33] <sphereshots12> People still play 3rd strike
[0:31:37] <FockHead> In a weird way I don't mind BBTag existing instead of P5A. It was something very different
[0:31:38] <%CaptainPileDriver> more characters, but tripping
[0:31:46] <fist_wizard_jay> either way, Gill looking like a damn bichromatic Pillar Man is pretty cool lol
[0:31:49] <SuperKirby24> "Moved on from melee" LUL
[0:31:58] <+Superbro64> dont brawl players play project m now?
[0:31:59] <pyookoomookoo> brawl was designed to piss off melee fans
[0:32:00] <bitterssweets> Melee is cool, kinda stinky in public events tho
[0:32:11] <fist_wizard_jay> needs soap
[0:32:29] <kiharakun> go in to game, down air someone as ganon, get punished for hitting a powerful move, return game
[0:32:35] <Needwagon_for_speedwagon> ID and a bar of Soap required on entry
[0:32:37] <zenith0111> Hey guys you're girlfriend cheering is coaching Kappa
[0:32:41] <+heartbbyy> NaM cmonBruh TriHard
[0:32:44] <MemoryOfDust> @pyookoomookoo no it was designed to be fun. melee fans got pissed off all on their own
[0:32:47] <Kirby_Sauce> Has woolie learned not to hiy Y too many times yet?
[0:32:48] <lordsdb> I would love to see kof13 back at evo
[0:32:55] <Serge_12> Reggie, what are your thoughts on SF5 CE?
[0:32:56] <odd_slater> Yeah
[0:32:57] <+Superbro64> virtua fighter 5 tourneys run to this day
[0:33:00] <+Prevot> Melee is my least favorite smash
[0:33:04] <%CaptainPileDriver> hell, third strike tournament's still are hype as fuck
[0:33:09] <fist_wizard_jay> Does your girlfriend lathering you in soap count as coaching?
[0:33:10] <odd_slater> USF4 Is fun man
[0:33:15] <%CaptainPileDriver> yay
[0:33:17] <SomersaultJustice> I'd watch an Alpha 2 tourney so hard
[0:33:18] <+Superbro64> in fact it seems that entrants for the average jp vf5 tourney is increasing
[0:33:26] <kennyfz> Are we in?
[0:33:31] <%CaptainPileDriver> naruto time, time for ninja ullshit with ninja jesus and ninja judas
[0:33:35] <SuperKirby24> Does Shenmue 3 count as VF6 Kappa
[0:33:40] <%CaptainPileDriver> RYU
[0:33:43] <%CaptainPileDriver> I KNOW THEM
[0:33:43] <fist_wizard_jay> Laptop was rebootin
[0:33:50] <%CaptainPileDriver> RYU IS SOOOOO GOOD
[0:33:51] <+Superbro64> may your chakra dash cancels be true
[0:33:54] <MemoryOfDust> KOF98 is the only fighting game
[0:33:58] <bitterssweets> Everyone got hyped for Gil, then they remembered it still SF5
[0:34:04] <fist_wizard_jay> lol
[0:34:04] <kiharakun> THE BEST PART is gil literally gets a better parry than ryu
[0:34:04] <SophisticHades> tight
[0:34:06] <+gustavozxd> I hope that means sfv is finally over
[0:34:08] <NarcissistCactus> atpCap
[0:34:11] <+heartbbyy> he was tight?
[0:34:15] <MutedMimic> LuL
[0:34:15] <OldManDeckardCain> Ryu just loves his parries like Jacob loves his blessings
[0:34:17] <Serge_12> No, I wanna know! pianodScrub pianodScrub pianodScrub
[0:34:18] <RogerCxd> they only have one brawl tournament a year and it's a side event at Super Smash Con
[0:34:21] <FockHead> I'll try it for sure, if nothing else good to see Capcom won't let SF5 die yet
[0:34:22] <sphereshots12> So that's why project M. exhist
[0:34:26] <%Crashfan01> Ryu HAS to parry
[0:34:26] <blue6sub6remnant6> Somebody give Reggie a hug.
[0:34:28] <fist_wizard_jay> RednBlue Pillar Man has a better parry than Ryu
[0:34:30] <SomersaultJustice> did they release all the v skill 2s yet or not yet?
[0:34:31] <%CaptainPileDriver> except ryu has no edge and has been trash for years and years before
[0:34:33] <ittla> will capcom ever make a good fighting game again???
[0:34:35] <Needwagon_for_speedwagon> Didya dorks see playable Baz in Shovel Knight?
[0:34:36] <+Bricespresso> yooooo lp hype!

[0:37:22] <blue6sub6remnant6> It's back but i don't really care.
[0:37:22] <phatmac16> Got worse
[0:37:23] <+Superbro64> more pronounced buzz
[0:37:24] <+MrBaldachin> yeah it's still an issue
[0:37:24] <eddi401> I hear it
[0:37:29] <%johnny_gogo> i dont hear
[0:37:30] <Serge_12> it got louder
[0:37:32] <%johnny_gogo> its fine
[0:37:37] <fist_wizard_jay> its still there but I dont mind it
[0:37:38] <dundore77> i couldn't hear it until i turned my speakers all the way up
[0:37:40] <+AWr00tBear> Buzz is gone
[0:37:41] <phatmac16> Got louder
[0:37:43] <eddi401> o. ybykyy
[0:37:45] <scoopyoopydoo> why would you do a sign language joke with tiny emotes
[0:37:48] <shadowsofpain> mute mics individually?
[0:37:53] <fist_wizard_jay> prolly will be drowned out by ninja shit
[0:37:53] <Sedrelic> nop
[0:37:54] <%dmcredgrave> Is this one of those things that only people under a certain age can hear?
[0:37:55] <+ClaudeMcGarren> you guys must be deaf if you somehow dont hear it lol
[0:37:57] <TwinBat> woolie might figure it out
[0:37:59] <eddi401> only people who aren't old hear IT
[0:37:59] <zenith0111> @shadowsofpain 👍
[0:38:01] <NarcissistCactus> 👉 👌 ❓
[0:38:02] <+tuulu_t> Nice
[0:38:03] <+Superbro64> this is old ears vs young ears here
[0:38:05] <%Whately> Whately subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:38:08] <scoopyoopydoo> only kids can hear the ringing
[0:38:09] <bitterssweets> Woolie is intentionally keeping the buzz on to scare the older viewers away, so he can get the younger and more impressionable viewers on twitch
[0:38:13] <scoopyoopydoo> This is good
[0:38:16] <fist_wizard_jay> real boomer hours?
[0:38:18] <+OddityOn> gotta put volume at max to hear that ring
[0:38:19] <Dragon_Batman> Muuting mics individually sounds like a good idea
[0:38:22] <blue6sub6remnant6> It's really, really quiet, and really, really, high-pitched. I'd honestly say you don't need to worry about it.
[0:38:23] <%CaptainPileDriver> reggie, i'm about to send some poison to you
[0:38:23] <go4thekneez> Tinnitus 2: Electric Boogaloo
[0:38:23] <+Superbro64> some people cant hear that wavelength anymore
[0:38:28] <+Superbro64> huh
[0:38:29] <gnarly_memes_bro> its also more noticable with headphones. i'm using a speaker so i barely notice it
[0:38:30] <scoopyoopydoo> We can get rid of all the 12 year olds
[0:38:32] <+CoronetChris> Did they mute themselves again or is the stream repeating?
[0:38:38] <kiharakun> they muted again
[0:38:40] <MutedMimic> 4Head
[0:38:44] <+CoronetChris> Oh good.
[0:38:47] <Kinnon22> idk what people are saying, I hear no buzzing
[0:38:48] <rheviel> stream been on long? hello everyone
[0:38:52] <+AWr00tBear> I just have my volume at half so I don’t hear the ringing. But if I turn it all the way up I can hear it.
[0:38:54] <Iggeh0> no Woolie you can't say that word

[0:39:32] <SomersaultJustice> I guess I'm deaf cause I don't hear a buzz
[0:39:34] <+Prevot> Still there old man
[0:39:34] <mayorrev> we can hear you fine!
[0:39:43] <CrimsonSilver4> Its the type of ringing noise you hear on your everyday life, doesn't matter its not bothersome.
[0:39:46] <+dj_orpheus> Yeah it’s still there
[0:39:54] <prime_name> I think that's the game audio
[0:39:56] <shadowsofpain> One of the mics is picking up some bad buzz/ringing
[0:39:56] <Morning_Asakura> i can't not hear it. it's distracting
[0:40:00] <SuperKirby24> @SomersaultJustice same here
[0:40:01] <+IsThisOne1> you can't hear it without headphones
[0:40:02] <+thesyndrome> is it 4th great ninja war time?
[0:40:07] <+AWr00tBear> I’m using headphones and I don’t hear it. Also my volume is at half
[0:40:08] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I have to have a fan on or I hear that noise 100 percent of the time
[0:40:09] <fist_wizard_jay> yo I gotta say that EVO jacket is hot
[0:40:10] <dundore77> when i turn my speakers up i hear it by the time i can hear the naruto main menu theme but when turned down to only hear the guys but not the tv its fine.
[0:40:18] <gnarly_memes_bro> @IsThisOne1 i'm hearing it on my speaker dude
[0:40:21] <fist_wizard_jay> I gotta try and grab one next year
[0:40:27] <+IsThisOne1> i took mine off and can't hear it anymore
[0:40:29] <bethore> it could be a loose connection with one of the mics
[0:40:33] <MaximumCLS> @WoolieVersus have you seen the BBTag 2.0 update? It's cool if you don't care.
[0:40:34] <Serge_12> Put the tripods behind you
[0:40:35] <shadowsofpain> mute each mic individually
[0:40:38] <zenith0111> @awr00tbear Do you hear the soft backround music?
[0:40:52] <Serge_12> if they are long enough
[0:40:54] <blue6sub6remnant6> Noise only procs above a certain volume level.
[0:40:57] <muniea3> mounting brackets
[0:41:10] <blue6sub6remnant6> I'm pretty sure its Twitch.
[0:41:13] <+Kavtech> It's pretty easy to get permission from your landlord for that kind of thing in my experience.
[0:41:24] <kiharakun> it sounds like a coil whine more than a fucking up mic

[0:47:16] <ittla> Guy's delivery in this game is literally the same for every line
[0:47:17] <Exiliator> How much do I have to donate for japanese
[0:47:20] <ittla> it's too much
[0:47:21] <+gustavozxd> sounds like Dante

[0:47:25] <+Superbro64> GOD I love Guy's dub Kreygasm
[0:47:26] <%CaptainPileDriver> i just pulled a hard clump of deodorant from my pit
[0:47:30] <Psyramics> his accent is Might Guy
[0:47:35] <+Superbro64> guys dub is the BEST
[0:47:39] <zenith0111> Guy kind of slurred those lines cantaS
[0:47:42] <Reverend_Roscoe> i fucking hate tuning in to watch a stream and a fucking ad plays...
[0:47:43] <hassanico2> Time for BOAT FILLER
[0:47:45] <fist_wizard_jay> Guy turns out to be big dick fucking badass hero in the end
[0:47:46] <bpbranmuffin> I like that sasuke face. The full page spread of it in the manga, that art looks so good!
[0:47:47] <+CoronetChris> Lee inform the men, I've made it with a woman.
[0:47:48] <lordsdb> @woolieversus. did you see the sasuske vs raikage fight to?
[0:47:53] <Iggeh0> Gai's english VA is so good
[0:47:54] <hassanico2> Chat who here witnessed BOAT FILLER Arc?
[0:47:57] <+Superbro64> @fist_wizard_jay shhh no spoilers
[0:47:59] <blue6sub6remnant6> That's how a good translation works, Woolie.
[0:48:03] <mayorrev> this dub LUL
[0:48:08] <SuperKirby24> ...Naruto refusing a casual battle? Kappa
[0:48:09] <zenith0111> Is the Guy VA drunk? cantaS
[0:48:11] <muniea3> He's literally The Tick
[0:48:11] <mankeymania> branigans law!
[0:48:15] <+CoronetChris> @hassanico2 I still remember it.
[0:48:16] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I mean, Guy is cool, but he's basically a non presence outside of maybe ten chapters
[0:48:17] <oktavia_von> I love how troy baker is in this and death stranding
[0:48:18] <OldManDeckardCain> is he ruby's husband? LUL
[0:48:19] <mayorrev> Guy sounds like an asshole
[0:48:24] <%CaptainPileDriver> the cloud village where they use lightning, is of course, filled with black people
[0:48:32] <fist_wizard_jay> All Im gonna say is prepare for hype shit
[0:48:34] <+OddityOn> guy always sounded like this
[0:48:35] <%CaptainPileDriver> the only village
[0:48:37] <DragonSpooker> Hope Woolie watched the Kisame fight
[0:48:39] <+Kavtech> God I love the way this dork talks.
[0:48:43] <zenith0111> Corrrrrrect. Wtf
[0:48:43] <+OddityOn> in the dub
[0:48:45] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[0:48:47] <hassanico2> Basically Boat Filler was massively expanded in the anime
[0:48:50] <Needwagon_for_speedwagon> Yes, but Naruto doesn't know that @woolieversus .
[0:48:51] <+thesyndrome> Naruto is too dumb and headstrong for them to just tell him to chill on an island, so they are pretending it's a mission for him
[0:49:07] <+gustavozxd> Minh's memory calebS
[0:49:07] <fist_wizard_jay> but yeah @superbro64 I’ll keep quiet man
[0:49:19] <fist_wizard_jay> Dont want to ruin the hype shit!
[0:49:24] <Ashenik1> @thesyndrome LUL
[0:49:31] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Jesus christ I hate Naruto's voice most of all
[0:49:35] <+medinaj1990> how much of Naruto can be summed up as he's too dumb so we lied to him
[0:49:42] <fist_wizard_jay> a lot
[0:49:42] <BackwardCap> Full Strength ey? *Opens the 8th gate*
[0:49:43] <mankeymania> put yo glasses on
[0:49:44] <Needwagon_for_speedwagon> They know if Naruto knows what's truly going on, he'll be dumb and run head first into combat.
[0:49:45] <+Superbro64> telling people to prep for hype shit, is THE number one way you ruin said hype shit
[0:49:48] <oktavia_von> 70% of it
[0:49:48] <hassanico2> Sasuke getting horribly bodied, aw yeah
[0:49:49] <+heartbbyy> minh has alzheimers
[0:49:50] <blue6sub6remnant6> So Sasuke v.s Raikage. Opinions?
[0:49:51] <+Superbro64> no biggie tho
[0:49:53] <muniea3> LUL
[0:49:54] <+jepupu> These dubs are hilarious
[0:49:58] <+Chronobot> Raikage says FUCK YO FIRE

[0:50:08] <hassanico2> oh god Guy is going full on roleplay training
[0:50:08] <fist_wizard_jay> Sasuke gets fucking powerbombed by the Raikage
[0:50:09] <mankeymania> nothing will be wong

[0:50:19] <Ashenik1> Woolie pls got to japanese voices :<
[0:50:21] <0rond> guy in this game is so fucking cool
[0:50:23] <zenith0111> WHAT AN ASSHOLE lul
[0:50:25] <+McSoliace> Naruto dub has the exact same problem that i have with Dragon ball subbed
[0:50:28] <bpbranmuffin> Good, I was afraid Woolie would never see the hype ass Liger Bomb
[0:50:33] <%CaptainPileDriver> oh yeah this is 3, not 4, i forgot about that
[0:50:35] <CrimsonSilver4> I thought he was gonna roll over the fence for a secvond
[0:50:42] <%CaptainPileDriver> DEAD
[0:50:42] <0rond> he can power up, and than he can extra power up which drains his HP but gives hims a MASSIVE power boost
[0:50:43] <HarmlessCrow> Did Might Guy just open 8 gates in a friendly spar
[0:50:46] <bitterssweets> THICC
[0:50:46] <hassanico2> Guy wait this is training stop opening Gates!
[0:50:49] <+Shotgundam009> GUY IS FUCKING DEAD

[0:51:41] <zenith0111> @fist_wizard_jay Anime Logic LUL I've even seen some anime where they almost killed each other in sparring
[0:51:43] <shadowsofpain> Hey Woolie have you figured out the overcharging when you get to the orange health?
[0:51:43] <+heartbbyy> u should watch the anime and then these shitty games lol
[0:51:47] <+thesyndrome> @fist_wizard_jay >friendly sparring match; > uses technique that destroys yo0ur opponent on a cellular level

[0:55:10] <+Superbro64> (Adjusts glasses)
[0:55:10] <%mudkip_overlord> his full burst exclusive fight is the worst
[0:55:11] <+Spankys_Pizza> Yeah Kabooter just all of a sudden got real beef out of nowhere
[0:55:12] <+heartbbyy> couldnt get Hidan
[0:55:21] <ittla> the part of the ninja war arc that just goes all over the fucking place
[0:55:25] <bitterssweets> Hidan cant die
[0:55:25] <R3c0n31> Wait how short is this game? Cause i feel like this happened later
[0:55:25] <SuperKirby24> wait they havent rotted yet Kappa

[0:55:34] <zenith0111> @bpbranmuffin Except that bandages and some tape stops them LUL
[0:55:34] <+CoronetChris> Oh right snake Kabuto.
[0:55:35] <%CaptainPileDriver> you need some DNA of them

[0:55:42] <sphereshots12> Kashi versus sausage
[0:55:43] <Dragon_Batman> You need other bodies and some of the DNA
[0:55:45] <+bread_assassin> Hidan's still chilling at the bottom of a hole.
[0:55:46] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:55:48] <Exiliator> stronger maybe
[0:55:49] <hassanico2> English Madara sounds kinda like Soul Calibur announcer
[0:55:53] <dundore77> even more than full power. infinite jutsu
[0:55:55] <niddron> even more, they're immortal ffs
[0:55:56] <+heartbbyy> hidan malding in a ditch rn
[0:55:56] <NarcissistCactus> hidan stopped thinking
[0:56:00] <%CaptainPileDriver> guess what
[0:56:03] <+Shotgundam009> Basically mass grave robbing
[0:56:04] <fist_wizard_jay> infinite chakra bullshit levels
[0:56:05] <+thesyndrome> Kabuto has gone full tentacle snake mode at this point
[0:56:10] <%CaptainPileDriver> IT'S YA BOI, THE HIDDEN WEAPON BOI
[0:56:10] <+CoronetChris> Is it me, or is there an echo for the game audio?
[0:56:11] <ittla> guess which one that is!!!!!!!!
[0:56:16] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> HIDDEN WEAPON
[0:56:16] <bpbranmuffin> @zenith0111 Those items were plot infused tho LUL
[0:56:19] <Bluewolf544> Oh my god this fucking dialogue
[0:56:20] <%mudkip_overlord> Kabuto is just a loser who self inserts himself into the plot
[0:56:22] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Not only are they full power they have infinite chakra
[0:56:24] <fist_wizard_jay> HIDDEN POWER
[0:56:26] <357Sneak> It's like a Baseball Card Collection
[0:56:28] <TwinBat> lol woolie
[0:56:32] <Katalist_> scuffed audio
[0:56:32] <hassanico2> The First?
[0:56:33] <Zebroneath> Fair enough
[0:56:35] <+Superbro64> Kappa
[0:56:37] <fist_wizard_jay> MAKE A GUESS
[0:56:40] <zenith0111> @bpbranmuffin And the jutsu isn't??? LUL
[0:56:41] <dero45> Kabuto took fanboy for Orochi to next lvl
[0:56:42] <VidulaSaix> Kappa
[0:56:44] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> the racist is the 2ns
[0:56:46] <R3c0n31> Saitama?
[0:56:47] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> 2nd
[0:56:54] <+thesyndrome> you will actually never guess who it is in the coffin woolie, it's too crazy and you don't have enough info yet
[0:56:57] <%CaptainPileDriver> oh yeah, the second hokage is a racist
[0:56:59] <bpbranmuffin> @zenith0111 u rite BibleThump
[0:57:02] <OldManDeckardCain> 2nd was a cop LUL
[0:57:06] <fist_wizard_jay> lol
[0:57:07] <ittla> ninja race war
[0:57:08] <VidulaSaix> Second Hokage is SUPER racist LUL
[0:57:12] <jimmytwofeet> CONFIRM MY BATTLE STRENGTH BABY
[0:57:16] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @brunoberserk
[0:57:19] <oktavia_von> Kappa Kappa
[0:57:21] <bitterssweets> LIMITLESS
[0:57:22] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> If you're an Uchiha youre outta herea
[0:57:27] <dundore77> but the second hokage is a justified racist.
[0:57:27] <sectzodia> he's alt right, not racist
[0:57:29] <fist_wizard_jay> pfffft
[0:57:41] <fist_wizard_jay> I love this chat
[0:57:42] <WanderingSwordsman> @woolieversus they explain the limits in the anime
[0:57:44] <Bakefowl> !uptime
[0:57:45] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 57 minutes and 46 seconds
[0:57:46] <+Superbro64> this is shippuden woolie, all ninjitsu gets supee busted
[0:57:48] <DragonSpooker> I didn't realize all the dead people wasn't apart of Madara's plan
[0:57:54] <+Theworld732> I thought you needed their dna or something to redirect them
[0:57:55] <+greenfall> the 2nd was right and did nothing wrong
[0:57:57] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> gotta Sharingan? get ready for my gun
[0:57:57] <+heartbbyy> second hokage got bodied by a couple of jobbers
[0:57:58] <+UrielCobalt> booooo Sakura
[0:57:59] <bpbranmuffin> 2nd hokage was extreme........but was he wrong tho? LUL
[0:58:01] <niddron> second hokage hates them Uchiha
[0:58:01] <%CaptainPileDriver> BTW FOR THAT RESURRECTION JUTSU, YOU NEED some of the person you're going to revives DNA
[0:58:02] <Funny_Valent1ne> he needs dna
[0:58:03] <+Superbro64> @dragonspooker I realized that too
[0:58:05] <HarmlessCrow> I thought that said Anko for a second BibleThump
[0:58:09] <+thesyndrome> Tobirama isn't racist, he's prejudiced...based on ther uchiha's being a bunch of complete assholes
[0:58:10] <shadowsofpain> 2nd Hokage: The Class war starts NOW!
[0:58:12] <R3c0n31> Hey look Sakura the jobber
[0:58:18] <ittla> i forgot is this before or after tsunade pretends to be dead
[0:58:20] <+OddityOn> 2nd hokage did nothing wrong
[0:58:24] <$BallerSwagBro9k> I think he needs the bodies tho cuz he couldn't resurrect Jiraya because his body sunk into the depth of the ocean
[0:58:33] <dundore77> anything orochimaru knew kabuto now knows
[0:58:37] <fist_wizard_jay> Sakura the giga jobber
[0:58:39] <herfaintsmile> this series has a REALLY weird fixation with dna
[0:58:45] <+Dre_> ittla she wasnt pretending lol she was in a coma
[0:58:46] <bitterssweets> Sakura's moral of the story: Cry, bitch and moan until you get what you want.
[0:58:54] <HarmlessCrow> Imagine Sakura actually having a good fight after Sasori
[0:58:55] <niddron> 2nd hokage was racist, except all his prejudice proved to be right
[0:58:57] <MaximumCLS> man I can still here the ringing, feelsbadman
[0:59:01] <%CaptainPileDriver> well, that's explained later.
[0:59:03] <MaximumCLS> *hear
[0:59:04] <zenith0111> I love how big the casualty count in the Ninja war is so huge even tho it was like 20 Ninjas vs an Army LUL
[0:59:06] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @herfaintsmile Kinda like MG and nanomachines
[0:59:07] <+Dre_> and after ittla
[0:59:08] <+Superbro64> Sakura the One with the Giant Foreheas
[0:59:10] <blue6sub6remnant6> Also, snake sage chakra.
[0:59:10] <shadowsofpain> He needs a certain amount of DNA to use the resurrection jutsu
[0:59:13] <ittla> she was effectively pretending to be dead okay
[0:59:14] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> cant be racist if youre right Kappa
[0:59:17] <noorejji> what's with this echo
[0:59:21] <Heartless_01> he lost his beloved snekman and went a little nuts
[0:59:22] <GKannel> Why is there echo?
[0:59:23] <kennyfz> One thing that's always on my mind when they're doing all this World Ninja War stuff. Someone somewhere is doing shitty missions like fiding stray cats
[0:59:25] <+Superbro64> Forehead so large you can land an airliner on it
[0:59:30] <NarcissistCactus> FeelsGoodMan
[0:59:36] <Ether101_Prime> Everyone know that the whole Uchiha thing is probably because Masashi's butt hurt over how people treat his twin brother Seishi?
[0:59:37] <Psyramics> @GKannel mics are picking up the game audio
[0:59:44] <thexiiilightning> He needs the DNA of the dead person, and access to their soul. The 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th Hokage CAN'T be revived because their soul got sealed by the Death's Seal Jutsu
[0:59:46] <adamisfruit> Orochimaru is never REALLY gone
[0:59:47] <+Superbro64> such a large forehead, yet such a tiny brain
[0:59:48] <fist_wizard_jay> That forehead could tank a bijuudama
[0:59:56] <%CaptainPileDriver> "protect" yeah, the man who can blow up cities and mountains needs to be protected
[1:00:00] <+UrielCobalt> Sakura is boring bubblegum who never had any original moves
[1:00:01] <blue6sub6remnant6> Feel mics-are-picking-up-the-game-audio man.
[1:00:02] <%CaptainPileDriver> at least a little bit of DNA
[1:00:02] <MaximumCLS> Audio issues? On MY Woolieversus? Why I never
[1:00:09] <GoldeNOVA> Why didn't he just dig up Hidan?
[1:00:17] <herfaintsmile> no boat filler?
[1:00:18] <fist_wizard_jay> I gotta agree
[1:00:20] <GoldeNOVA> Just stitch him back up
[1:00:21] <MindlessMonks> wassup @WoolieVersus Chester
[1:00:22] <%CaptainPileDriver> @GoldeNOVA cause fuck hidan

[1:00:28] <shadowsofpain> he had no clue where Hidan was buried
[1:00:28] <niddron> nobody knew where hidan was
[1:00:30] <fist_wizard_jay> true lol
[1:00:31] <hassanico2> BOAT FILLER ARC
[1:00:32] <+Shotgundam009> No one knows where Hidan is lol
[1:00:32] <Heartless_01> lmao
[1:00:32] <+UrielCobalt> Hidan's immortality is attached to magic, not DNA
[1:00:33] <CrimsonSilver4> Meanwhile in HxH...
[1:00:34] <Dragon_Batman> Jiraiya can't happen because he is in an ocean
[1:00:35] <Psyramics> Boat Filler Boat Filler
[1:00:35] <Solidnick18> the boat arc sucks
[1:00:36] <zenith0111> I love how Orochimaru has the most forced redemption arc I've ever seen
[1:00:38] <biomegabear> filler fuckery
[1:00:39] <$BallerSwagBro9k> BOAT ARC
[1:00:39] <fist_wizard_jay> BOAT FILLER OVER

[1:01:00] <+OddityOn> lol ofc they wouldnt do that, this game has its OWN filler
[1:01:03] <phatmac16> Naruto meet luffy
[1:01:04] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Filler is always evil
[1:01:05] <Solidnick18> Remember with the ninja animals
[1:01:05] <Psyramics> you watch it praying that its not filler
[1:01:07] <Itsjsmithbubble> it was the worst time
[1:01:08] <gnarly_memes_bro> ya yo ya yo believe on the seas me harties
[1:01:11] <R3c0n31> CC2 saved my care for the series cause of that bad filler
[1:01:11] <Afrosaber> The shadow clone filled boat lmao
[1:01:11] <+heartbbyy> berserk filler
[1:01:11] <+Zeemod155> I think so
[1:01:12] <+paladinstarbuster> all Naruto filler is good
[1:01:13] <dundore77> there was filler still going after the manga was over for over a year
[1:01:14] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @zenith0111
[1:01:15] <+AWr00tBear> Boat Filler was the worst
[1:01:16] <fist_wizard_jay> yeah lets just do filler BEFORE THE 4TH NINJA WAR
[1:01:17] <niddron> oh god
[1:01:17] <+UrielCobalt> The fuck is the Ostrich ninja?

[1:02:21] <+UrielCobalt> Ain't no damn ostrich ninja, thats filler fanfiction
[1:02:25] <kennyfz> That's dumb, everybody knows ostriches can't be ninjas. They can't do no Jutsu with no hands
[1:02:26] <+paladinstarbuster> kakashi's dog
[1:02:30] <ittla> so when does Lars from Tekken show up in this game
[1:02:31] <niddron> there's a echo yeah
[1:02:32] <bpbranmuffin> I love how completely irrelevant the map traversing is in this game lol
[1:02:33] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @thesyndrome
[1:02:36] <GoldeNOVA> THe ringing is still here, too
[1:02:40] <+Alec_The_Risktaker> oh game echo?
[1:02:41] <+OddityOn> Naruto Bot is in Revolution
[1:02:44] <dundore77> tv louder?
[1:02:46] <%johnny_gogo> same ringing for me
[1:02:46] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:02:49] <+gustavozxd> @ittla wrong game

[1:02:50] <+thesyndrome> @herfaintsmile look up "mecha-naruto"
[1:02:53] <+AWr00tBear> So after the 5 Kage summit....
[1:02:53] <mayorrev> is the TV too loud?
[1:02:56] <+IsThisOne1> Lars is in storm 2
[1:02:56] <%CaptainPileDriver> maybe the tv is louder and is picking up on the mics
[1:02:57] <TwinBat> maybe we're only picking up the tv through the mic?
[1:02:59] <+Deano8817> tv louder
[1:03:00] <HarmlessCrow> HarmlessCrow subscribed at Tier 1. 
[1:03:01] <+gustavozxd> Lars shows up in 2
[1:03:02] <EndgameContent> Not gonna lie, it's kinda cool seeing how the sausage is made with these LPs
[1:03:03] <SuperKirby24> @kennyfz they do the signs with their feet LUL
[1:03:06] <%CaptainPileDriver> huh
[1:03:06] <gnarly_memes_bro> yeah the ringing is still there but the game audio is mostly covering it for me
[1:03:09] <+Deano8817> oh
[1:03:10] <%CaptainPileDriver> okay
[1:03:13] <niddron> can we talk how the infinite tsukyomi is actually not a bad idea in theory?!
[1:03:17] <%KoyFoster> Oh no. How late am I?
[1:03:18] <%johnny_gogo> @WoolieVersus audio monitoring on obs?
[1:03:21] <+DomunDomunDomun> Are you sure all 1000 tabs are muted?
[1:03:22] <bethore> its picking up through your mics
[1:03:23] <Solidnick18> ?
[1:03:32] <shadowsofpain> the needle swords were retroactively made canon but I'm unsure if that means that the filler were they where introduced was made canon
[1:03:32] <+McSoliace> it didn't start until you met Guy
[1:03:33] <+Alec_The_Risktaker> @bethore tv is muted
[1:03:34] <blue6sub6remnant6> Well then... Woolie Will Figure It Out.
[1:03:35] <zenith0111> @niddron That's just how you feel not aa fact LUL
[1:03:35] <rheviel> the joys of troubleshooting
[1:03:40] <ittla> i think Lars is forever canon in naruto and its unfair if he's not in titles after storm 2
[1:03:42] <herfaintsmile> @thesyndrome i can't believe mecha-naruto is an actual character, anime was a mistake
[1:03:58] <Morning_Asakura> holy shit lars was in strom 2
[1:04:00] <bpbranmuffin> @niddron If they did the plan and just asked ppl to consent to the infinite tsukuyomi and then charged for it, itd be the best plan ever LUL
[1:04:05] <+Alec_The_Risktaker> We stil hear it
[1:04:05] <masterofzin> yea
[1:04:05] <muniea3> we hear it

[1:04:07] <gnarly_memes_bro> OH jeez i forgot Lars was in NS2 he was great in that one
[1:04:08] <+gustavozxd> surprised Naruto or some shit isn't in Tekken LUL that would be amazing

[1:31:39] <%Jordan_z123> Jordan_z123 subscribed at Tier 1. 
[1:31:40] <CrimsonSilver4> It's not bothersome
[1:31:41] <$AliasofApocalypse> Yes and ringing
[1:31:41] <FackinCrazy> sounds good to me
[1:31:42] <Quantum_Cholo> doesnt really bother me
[1:31:45] <EndgameContent> It's fine

[1:31:45] <Dovakhin573> not bothersome
[1:31:45] <Exiliator> Nah its not too bad
[1:31:46] <digoquadros> its not bad, no
[1:31:48] <MaximumCLS> The ringing is very loud though
[1:31:48] <bitterssweets> the audio is muffled, we cant hear the character voices properly
[1:31:48] <GKannel> I mean, it echoes with the normal audio
[1:31:49] <rheviel> it's not the worst
[1:31:49] <cryomaniac8383> it sounds like an audio cable isnt in all the way
[1:31:49] <Solidnick18> just fix it next time i guess
[1:31:50] <Quantum_Cholo> if it echoes it echoes
[1:31:51] <+QueequegTheater> ring a ding ding
[1:31:54] <+SnugglyBurrick> It ain't bothering me

[1:31:58] <niddron> we watch Naruto, we will take anything
[1:31:58] <+deidriel> it sounds better
[1:31:58] <issaltar1> not really let there be echoing
[1:32:02] <OldManDeckardCain> we can't hear the bad dub this way so it's a win in my book LUL

[1:48:16] <%Shohinzo> So anyone gonna clip the drift and through gas gas gas on it?
[1:48:18] <0rond> you can do your up combo and chakra dash into an air combo
[1:48:20] <hassanico2> Chat I can't tell which one is the evil one
[1:48:23] <Morning_Asakura> there are combos
[1:48:25] <OldManDeckardCain> Dark Naruto is just Naruto after saying the N-word
[1:48:35] <spirittiart> DO THE COMBO
[1:48:41] <Kirby_Sauce> DARKUTO
[1:48:42] <Solidnick18> that's you tho
[1:48:48] <%Shohinzo> @oldmandeckardcain LUL
[1:48:48] <Malikwest11> that with justu
[1:48:57] <NarcissistCactus> naruto black
[1:49:03] <+BurkeBigsby> Just load chakra during string. Unless it's different than the ps4 version.
[1:49:05] <tr00ly_> a lot less talking in these fights than in the show
[1:49:07] <niddron> if you use your jutsu (triangle, circle) you hold the circle
[1:49:07] <Personified134> oh my god I just came back and i'm greeted with DARK NARUTO
[1:49:10] <0rond> if you can predict when the opponet is gonna subtitue, you can cancel your combo with chakra dash into him, and continue your combo after he wasted one of his subs
[1:49:13] <phatmac16> Dark Naruto got the N-word pass from Bee
[1:49:13] <kennyfz> Kick yourself in the balls!
[1:49:14] <hassanico2> FLATTEN the THICC
[1:49:17] <Kirby_Sauce> Surprised woolie hasn't gone into training or vs mode tonworkshop
[1:49:18] <fist_wizard_jay> is this Naruto with blackface?
[1:49:24] <ittla> face out hold out
[1:49:25] <Personified134> HE DIDN'T FLATTEN THE WALL
[1:49:28] <ittla> reach out to the truth
[1:49:28] <masterfire23> does this game have tag or only storm 4
[1:49:31] <redrins> naruto black
[1:49:35] <mankeymania> GAME OVER
[1:49:43] <Dragon_Batman> It's not like you'll super need it during the story mode
[1:49:45] <Exiliator> "This completely doesnt feel like a win"?
[1:49:46] <niddron> @woolieversus triangle and then hold circle
[1:49:46] <phatmac16> DONT SHOOT HIM HES NOT BLACK
[1:49:46] <+heartbbyy> no thiccest wal PepeHands
[1:49:54] <Kirby_Sauce> Flick the stick
[1:49:55] <Morning_Asakura> only 4
[1:49:55] <kingkeldeo31> Wait this is just Mt. Ordeals from FF4
[1:49:55] <+OddityOn> when you play online youll see the difference in technique
[1:49:58] <WanderingSwordsman> Yea, the "Will of Fire"
[1:49:59] <hassanico2> @Exiliator shoulda used "Totally" instead
[1:50:01] <huskrow> Hold circle when youre doing rasengan to do an enhanced version
[1:50:02] <redrins> did storm 3 have tilts? I forgot
[1:50:07] <rheviel> should be able to combo into a super while they are stunned from combo
[1:50:11] <OldManDeckardCain> Oh no, they are gonna remove Naruto from the position of Hokage after Dark Naruto pics surface NotLikeThis
[1:50:21] <niddron> @redrins it does
[1:50:23] <fist_wizard_jay> LOL
[1:50:29] <Kirby_Sauce> Persona
[1:50:33] <+EvCrom> is this p4?
[1:50:35] <Pat_Squared> @masterfire23 If I remember tag switching was added to 4 yeah
[1:50:36] <phatmac16> Dark Naruto got cancelled
[1:50:41] <oktavia_von> my last two brain cells
[1:50:44] <%JetpackMcQuack> "YOU can't be ME! I'M me!"
[1:50:44] <%Shohinzo> Nah he’ll make a statement saying his really goumenasorry
[1:50:46] <Sokumotanaka> "I am thou, thou art I"
[1:50:52] <phatmac16> PERSONA
[1:50:59] <fist_wizard_jay> Dark Naruto gets hit by cancel culture?
[1:51:01] <mankeymania> bbn lack naruto with two guns and a bud in mouth
[1:51:02] <blue6sub6remnant6> Legit pathos.
[1:51:10] <mankeymania> black*
[1:51:12] <niddron> he's not lying though!
[1:51:14] <0rond> you have a combo when you don't hold any direction, a combo when you hold down on the left stick, a combo when you hold left or right, and a combo when you hold up, the up combo will usually launch the opponet into the air, and than you can chakra dash into him to do an air combo
[1:51:27] <Sokumotanaka> Would naruto get that fox persona from OG p4?
[1:51:27] <OldManDeckardCain> "When you think about, it's not my fault I wore blackface, it's all of the village's fault because of our bigoted culture"
[1:51:28] <phatmac16> EVOKER

[1:54:53] <CelioHogane> Zangetsu wasn't Zangetsu
[1:55:00] <mankeymania> busta rhymes of ninjas
[1:55:01] <Kirby_Sauce> bee just called out naruto's voice
[1:55:01] <lordsdb> Yeah
[1:55:05] <OldManDeckardCain> it was actually a fusion of his shinigami and hollow poers
[1:55:09] <Solidnick18> ugh
[1:55:09] <OldManDeckardCain> powers*
[1:55:09] <medril07> that I could bust a rhyme
[1:55:09] <+Superbro64> eeuuuugh
[1:55:13] <shadowsofpain> Ok, Hollow Ichigo was actually Zangetsu all along. the Old man with the black cloak was a version of the main evil Quincy.
[1:55:14] <OldManDeckardCain> or some shiet
[1:55:18] <Solidnick18> Ya fool
[1:55:20] <medril07> and if we're being honest

[1:55:27] <phatmac16> The jp version is way better
[1:55:29] <fairore> the twister of the clouds
[1:55:37] <Exiliator> Japanese Bee is awesome
[1:55:39] <fist_wizard_jay> Didnt Renji get drop kicked by someone?
[1:55:39] <sectzodia> Rest in peace eughhhhhh
[1:55:39] <%CaptainPileDriver> that guy was still a better VA
[1:55:40] <odd_slater> I don't think so
[1:55:43] <hassanico2> He was doing Enka IIRC
[1:55:45] <not_twitter_rowan> Wait, is this game just a straight up adaptation of the manga
[1:55:49] <hassanico2> Enka's a Japanese style of song I think
[1:55:53] <phatmac16> Jp bee was sick
[1:55:56] <%JetpackMcQuack> JP is better because I could't understand if it was cringey
[1:55:57] <+Chazmosis> A Rip Slyme reference
[1:55:58] <Sol_Install> yeah~
[1:55:59] <+OddityOn> not comepletly
[1:56:01] <BigManLugan> only cool thing about Ichigo was having him become the 3rd double zanpakto user
[1:56:02] <OldManDeckardCain> why are talking about an aven worse anime in chat again LUL
[1:56:04] <bsmusic> I like how in the dub it actually rhymes
[1:56:06] <mankeymania> voiced by supa hawt fya
[1:56:16] <Dragon_Batman> Eight Tails is a bro
[1:56:19] <jase__x> @woolieversus Bee was based off RZA
[1:56:24] <+CoronetChris> Yeah Bee, have a rap battle
[1:56:25] <Sol_Install> best combo here
[1:56:26] <phatmac16> But eyepatchwolf said gantz is good
[1:56:28] <+OddityOn> eight tails is the homie
[1:56:28] <%Shohinzo> Oh god make it a rap battle
[1:56:31] <Sokumotanaka> Different beast man
[1:56:41] <CelioHogane> Most tailed beast are actually kinda nice
[1:56:48] <Pat_Squared> he also does admit that he calmed down too
[1:56:49] <+Superbro64> did anyone see the shukaku in a vase in boruto tho PogChamp
[1:56:55] <Sol_Install> Bee and Gyūki are tight
[1:57:01] <+CoronetChris> The Slug tailed beast is actually very nice.
[1:57:01] <+Superbro64> that was pretty hype my dudes PogChamp Kappa
[1:57:02] <Sokumotanaka> He's only wild cause japan can't write black characters
[1:57:11] <fairore> lol
[1:57:20] <CelioHogane> @Sokumotanaka what are you talking about, Bee is legit
[1:57:23] <hassanico2> @Sokumotanaka I point you at Darui
[1:57:30] <jase__x> they can write black characters it's just rare to find the good ones
[1:57:31] <spirittiart> DO THE COMBO
[1:57:36] <CelioHogane> BIG DAMAGE
[1:57:38] <hassanico2> Darui rules and becomes nu Raikage even
[1:57:41] <Iggeh0> @Sokumotanaka Darui was a regular behaved guy
[1:57:50] <+BurkeBigsby> Honestly Up combo is best.
[1:58:12] <Sokumotanaka> @hassanico2 I point to all of japan @CelioHogane @Iggeh0
[1:58:14] <Kirby_Sauce> just pull up training or vs and workshop this
[1:58:36] <Psyramics> why are you trying to raw super!
[1:58:40] <hassanico2> But... thicc walls...
[1:58:44] <CelioHogane> @Sokumotanaka i mean if we go by that, they can't write white characters either
[1:58:46] <bsmusic> Raw story
[1:58:48] <0rond> what
[1:58:53] <Sokumotanaka> Like Darui is fine he's my fav but he got no screentime
[1:58:54] <0rond> i think that's a lie
[1:58:57] <Kirby_Sauce> why are you charging up to full
[1:59:03] <%CaptainPileDriver> i miss the broken mess that was the first game where you could combo into ultimate's if you timed it right
[1:59:07] <%Shohinzo> I love how the super bark for killer bee is wheee!
[1:59:07] <bpbranmuffin> Woolie still doesnt know about how to awaken tho does he?

[1:59:24] <0rond> @WoolieVersus get into fighting games NUNS when?
[1:59:28] <Dragon_Batman> You actually have 3 combos
[1:59:28] <VidulaSaix> There's more than 1 combo
[1:59:29] <hassanico2> @Restartist yes he mentioned the double lariat earlier
[1:59:29] <rheviel> they'll keep blocking supers. try mixing the super in the middle of a combo.
[1:59:32] <0rond> woah woah nah, you have 3
[1:59:35] <0rond> and an air combo
[1:59:37] <+BurkeBigsby> You have up, neutral and down combo.
[1:59:40] <Bailey__gaming> Hey Woolie & friends :)
[1:59:40] <Sokumotanaka> @CelioHogane When you're in 100% of media I don't think that's a comparable formula.
[1:59:42] <+Kavtech> If you tilt up or down the combo changes.
[1:59:43] <Restartist> thank you hssanico <3
[1:59:52] <%CaptainPileDriver> you have 4 combos, the up down neutral and air combo
[1:59:58] <%kingdovachief> Yay woolie

[2:00:57] <+MrRabbles> doesn't some one in naruto actually pull that?
[2:01:01] <+goose_attack_almanac> If a Shadow Clone busts a nut inside someone and gets them pregnant but disappears... What happens to the Egg
[2:01:03] <Sokumotanaka> @WoolieVersus He almost drowned cause he was defending two people at the time
[2:01:06] <fairore> for bee that is
[2:01:12] <dekkitout> Run away no jutsu

[2:01:47] <Sol_Install> NO SWING NO SAD
[2:01:49] <+MrRabbles> Swing betrayal
[2:01:50] <EndgameContent> No Boy No Cry
[2:01:50] <%FrostedZaibatsu> Jesus they play this same scene like 40 times each eps
[2:01:51] <Solidnick18> no swing of sadness
[2:01:53] <+Croire> ITs not a real flashback if they dont show the swing at least once
[2:01:58] <thexiiilightning> The swing is now a tourist attraction in Boruto
[2:02:02] <sectzodia> Hello darkness my old friend
[2:02:03] <oktavia_von> without the swing the flashback don't count
[2:02:08] <fist_wizard_jay> SWINGGATE
[2:02:11] <gnarly_memes_bro> the swing was a sad place, not an angry place
[2:02:16] <%Shohinzo> The swing is canon
[2:02:22] <Aydarkzero> is the swing scene he's talking about the one where Naruto is sad on the swing?
[2:02:23] <VidulaSaix> REACH OUT TO THE TRUTH
[2:02:33] <catrequiem> Naruto fighting his edgyness
[2:02:34] <%Shohinzo> @aydarkzero Yes
[2:02:37] <sectzodia> *swing
[2:02:38] <0rond> the swing is being alienated by the children, not by the village
[2:02:39] <+CoronetChris> #NOTMYFLASHBACK
[2:02:40] <MegaFangKing23> #WheresTheSwing
[2:02:40] <+heartbbyy> swing was there for naruto when no one else was
[2:02:42] <OldManDeckardCain> SWINGIT
[2:02:42] <fist_wizard_jay> THE SWINGGATE SCANDAL
[2:02:44] <hassanico2> @Aydarkzero exactly
[2:02:47] <Personified134> OCTODAD IS A NINJA
[2:02:50] <rheviel> not paying attention to chat tho
[2:03:01] <Trigecko> the swing got destroyed when pain blew up the village
[2:03:03] <Kirby_Sauce> HEY
[2:03:04] <Aydarkzero> that flashback isn't sad enough then!
[2:03:07] <kingkeldeo31> #Swing-kun should've been at the wedding
[2:03:10] <Kirby_Sauce> IRUKA IS GOOD
[2:03:11] <Solidnick18> iruka helped him somewhat
[2:03:12] <hassanico2> Iruka's basically Naruto's dad figure
[2:03:14] <+OddityOn> LOL HE DOESNT KNOW
[2:03:16] <Dragon_Batman> Iruka doesn't get dropped
[2:03:16] <nothuzad> I assume woolie is now even more scared cuz in GG Strive Octo can steal Woolz soul even harder :)
[2:03:16] <Aydarkzero> magic jutsu monkaS
[2:03:19] <Sol_Install> iruka is....
[2:03:19] <MegaFangKing23> Iruka is actually trash as a ninja LUL
[2:03:21] <Sol_Install> I mean
[2:03:22] <herfaintsmile> does iruka even have any abilities
[2:03:22] <Iggeh0> he works in freaking kindergarden lol
[2:03:24] <%KoyFoster> He's my dad!
[2:03:25] <0rond> the lack of swing is a reference to the fact that naruto is now in a committed relationship with sasuke and stopped being a swinger
[2:03:26] <redrins> he was the father figure naruto had
[2:03:28] <+BurkeBigsby> He used teach no jutst
[2:03:29] <nothuzad> iruka is just very mediocre
[2:03:29] <Kirby_Sauce> woolie doesn't know
[2:03:29] <VidulaSaix> Woolie confirmed for thinknig you only matter if you're strong LUL
[2:03:33] <CelioHogane> IRUKA IS THE BEST
[2:03:33] <gnarly_memes_bro> @WoolieVersus He's the one that taught Naruto Talk no jutsu!
[2:03:37] <%generalve> He's a regular teacher woolie
[2:03:37] <hassanico2> Isn't Iruka's big super "I throw a shuriken"
[2:03:38] <Exiliator> Teaching no jutsu
[2:03:39] <Sokumotanaka> WOOLIE the MAGIC DOESN'T MATTER HERE He's literally a father to naruto
[2:03:41] <+MrRabbles> Iruka tried his best BibleThump
[2:03:42] <sectzodia> Those who cant do..
[2:03:42] <+CoronetChris> Iruka's jutsu was being a dad!
[2:03:44] <+Superbro64> he works with actual children though
[2:03:48] <fist_wizard_jay> Iruka is actually a jobber with plot relevance
[2:03:48] <Kirby_Sauce> iruka is a good missle
[2:03:50] <0rond> #IRUKA'S MY REAL DAD
[2:03:51] <niddron> he's was his best man at his wedding, Naruto never forgot.
[2:03:52] <+Superbro64> he's a child caretaker
[2:03:53] <MegaFangKing23> LUL
[2:03:54] <VidulaSaix> Obi Wan?
[2:03:57] <Psyramics> Woolie out here just hating on elementary school teachers
[2:03:57] <VidulaSaix> You mean Anakin LUL
[2:03:59] <Sol_Install> Iruka wan
[2:04:01] <0rond> the fact iruka survived naruto without dying is a miracle
[2:04:03] <+Melanon> LIGHTENING BLITZ ATTACK
[2:04:04] <%KoyFoster> Lol. These guys are so good at being wrong.
[2:04:04] <CelioHogane> NO, OBI WAN
[2:04:04] <Aydarkzero> iruka is the guy who gave his headband to Naruto right?
[2:04:05] <+CoronetChris> You mean Anakin?
[2:04:06] <%generalve> Kappa
[2:04:08] <nothuzad> obi wan is evil now deal with it :)
[2:04:10] <+ItsRatman> No he meant quan chi
[2:04:11] <biomegabear> Is iruka playable in any of these games?
[2:04:15] <hassanico2> OBIWAN LUL
[2:04:17] <MegaFangKing23> That was Anakin
[2:04:18] <Madbearv> didn't he raise naruto
[2:04:18] <%JetpackMcQuack> Someone has to teach the kindergarteners
[2:04:20] <HolisticField> strength is measured in our ability to help others get stronger
[2:04:24] <majindusto> IRUKA THE BEST
[2:04:27] <Aydarkzero> he did the thing!
[2:04:29] <odd_slater> Yeah Iruka is playable
[2:04:31] <Sokumotanaka> So woolie has the mentality of "If they don't kill a roomful of people with magic, they aren't worth my time."
[2:04:32] <muniea3> Iruka Franz Ferdinand
[2:04:37] <CelioHogane> @biomegabear in 4 he is
[2:04:41] <gnarly_memes_bro> AND WHAT DID HE DO? He talked cool and isnpierd Naruto! HE TAUGHT IT TO HIM
[2:04:43] <%CaptainPileDriver> he took a fucking giant ninja weapon in the back
[2:04:44] <mankeymania> tiger man?
[2:04:49] <MegaFangKing23> Iruka was playable in the Gamecube games
[2:04:50] <biomegabear> @CelioHogane what are his suppers?
[2:04:56] <GoldeNOVA> Iruka is the Mr. Satan of Naruto
[2:04:58] <WanderingSwordsman> oof that filler
[2:05:03] <Psyramics> Iruka prevented Naruto from becoming Gaara
[2:05:06] <CelioHogane> @biomegabear dunno, i just googled it

[2:16:20] <spirittiart> PLOT NO JUTSU
[2:16:22] <shadowsofpain> only the 8 tails. the Cloud village weren't as segregated as the other village jinjuriki
[2:16:23] <WhiteTetsu> the kids had the demon in them for a while then they made a trainingground for them
[2:16:24] <bsmusic> it was on purpose
[2:16:24] <+heartbbyy> @fairore its not just genes, its style, techiniques, personality, literally everything for most characters
[2:16:25] <Exiliator> Theyre weapons
[2:16:27] <%JetpackMcQuack> They're used as Mutally assured destruction between villages
[2:16:28] <VidulaSaix> Yeah remember Shukaku was also passed down
[2:16:28] <0rond> once the jinchuriiki system was in place, they tried to transfer them from person to person
[2:16:33] <+ArcanumMBD> @woolieversus it's both woolie. it became a tradition out of necessity to prevent the oh fuck
[2:16:35] <%generalve> @woolieversus it's only for the cloud village woolie
[2:16:38] <sectzodia> Chat don't exist guys
[2:16:39] <%CaptainPileDriver> the cloud village is the only one to do it
[2:16:42] <+greenfall> naruto was a special case

[2:17:00] <Sol_Install> Oh! i get what wooile saying

[2:17:05] <+melobread> melobread subscribed with Twitch Prime.

[2:17:14] <+coolthulhuu> oh my god theyre nukes. kojima is getting upset
[2:17:15] <+ArcanumMBD> @woolieversus it's a purification tradition for Cloud Village
[2:17:18] <0rond> the eight tails was transferred a lot more formally
[2:17:18] <+BurkeBigsby> It's different everywhere. done. Also nukes are fake.
[2:17:21] <%KoyFoster> Tradition implies they do it for fun.
[2:17:30] <Dragon_Batman> Up until the eight tails we believe they all just go raging
[2:17:38] <Sokumotanaka> I forgot that the cloud village had TWO jinjuriki
[2:17:39] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Keelah Bee
[2:17:40] <0rond> do they show Bee's history and flashbacks in the games?
[2:17:40] <+Superbro64> you aint just gonna have kaiju roam free
[2:17:41] <%ozzrabbit> Do not tell Woolie about the previous nine-tails holder!
[2:17:43] <thexiiilightning> Gaara was assigned, and 2 Tail's jinchuuriki was selected at 2yo. Bee trained to 'earn' the 8 tails.
[2:17:44] <Agami23> you have inherited the nukes from the past nuke owner

[2:18:02] <bpbranmuffin> Reggie is the secret keeper of the chat
[2:18:05] <Sokumotanaka> Why did the cloud have two nukes?
[2:18:11] <+Superbro64> do we have any mods on spoiler free duty or something?
[2:18:11] <fist_wizard_jay> lol
[2:18:13] <0rond> because the 2 tails is weaker
[2:18:14] <CelioHogane> @Sol_Install well, Shukaku did, no?

[2:20:30] <Sokumotanaka> @CelioHogane In terms of tailed beast however which is the subject they function as still powerful beast that can nuke cities so I don't understand why the prior person said that the cloud had 2 cause the last one was weaker
[2:20:31] <+3InchMensch> Oh man, Woolie has no idea
[2:20:34] <+Superbro64> dont worry about it Kappa

[2:20:42] <+primax104> we moved away from that seasons ago
[2:20:42] <OldManDeckardCain> yes, because ninja going around spamming magic is very ninja like LUL
[2:20:44] <NemokillerV> Ninjas totally use demon demigods all the time.
[2:20:44] <fist_wizard_jay> just wait for the the war lol
[2:20:46] <+captain_history> Naruto is more about onmyodo powers than ninjutsu
[2:20:47] <SolClips> Bando

[2:20:49] <WhiteTetsu> its inception, its a genjustu in a genjustu

[3:09:38] <bsmusic> it's cause of his mum

[3:09:57] <horsesaredumb> Maybe a remnant from the original design from chapter 0?
[3:10:03] <shadowsofpain> Kurama's influence on the birth maybe?

[3:10:08] <hassanico2> She's still dying anyway
[3:10:08] <gnarly_memes_bro> @WoolieVersus I think they come from him being the baby of the jinchuriki cause he had them as soon as he was born

[3:10:19] <danbeer> she is as sturdy as a tank
