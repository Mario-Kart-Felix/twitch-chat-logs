[0:07:14] <+BlaklyteTV> Good afternoon everyone
[0:07:16] <%ThatGuyThere03> generally you just make a fighting game
[0:07:18] <%ThatGuyThere03> and people play it
[0:07:26] <+b_aleph> @swordmanegill FGC saltposting on facebook
[0:08:12] <%swordmanegill> @ThatGuyThere03 I hope so. The multiplayer over Parsec worked WAY better than we expected
[0:08:13] <+JustToWatch> if you put Rollback in the game, Sajam will probably play it
[0:08:23] <%Namillus> Any time there's a GIFG I wonder if Woolie's gonna be forcibly evicted from this game too
[0:08:47] <Ghostbody> mmmmm Tetris
[0:08:47] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:08:47] <%ThatGuyThere03> if you put a short haired girl with abs, woolie will definitely play it
[0:08:48] <%swordmanegill> @JustToWatch We used Parsec to play between Iceland and Poland and it was pretty darn good
[0:08:49] <Esparsenior> This is a good song bleedPurple

[0:10:05] <frostyjay3> Think of this stream as one big advertisement to go out and buy this game on the PSN store before it closes in July
[0:10:13] <solracc25> sbfpUno
[0:10:32] <%ThatGuyThere03> @swordmanegill so long as she does some Ippo shit, woolie will definitely give it a chance

[0:11:41] <%ThatGuyThere03> @aogman never in your life. that shit would be too expensive to do right
[0:11:44] <%swordmanegill> @swordmanegill we haven't fully decided on the entire roster visually. Most of the movesets and mechanics concepts are down though

[0:11:56] <the_rent_pursuer> Remember guys, the Cheapest way to legally get God Hand is on the PS3 psn store
[0:12:03] <Applecannon63> Honestly think Arcsys should make an SMT fighting were its just the demons as fighters
[0:12:06] <%Dr00_PhD> It's a mashup with Jojo's

[0:12:24] <%aogman> @aogman men must dream of the stars
[0:12:31] <@Menitta> I just want more Ultimax.
[0:12:32] <solracc25> jo jo jo jo
[0:12:33] <%ThatGuyThere03> actually the cheapest way to get God Hand legally is by emulating it
[0:12:35] <Second_Omega> @applecannon63 I’d buy that but I wanna play Demi-fiend
[0:12:47] <Oak_bogle> @menitta same
[0:12:47] <%ThatGuyThere03> don't let the industry tell you otherwise
[0:12:49] <+laysketchupchip> This needs a port to modern consoles
[0:12:54] <dustyjordans> dustyjordans subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:12:56] <frostyjay3> @Applecannon63 I really want them to make a Persona Arena and just have it feature characters from all 5 games
[0:13:02] <%jinking79> wonder how many Sho player there will be
[0:13:10] <the_rent_pursuer> @thatguythere03 I know, I just didn't want the boomers to get mad at me
[0:13:15] <+Story_Ark> oh shit woolz is playing p4a!
[0:13:25] <+b_aleph> May the universe be reminded that there is no ethical consumption under capitalism
[0:13:26] <+the22cstomp> there will be at least 1 marie player and i know who it is
[0:13:29] <+Story_Ark> chie best girl, church of chie is the true religion
[0:13:33] <@Solidus_113> there might not be online matches this stream
[0:13:41] <frostyjay3> @laysketchupchip Persona 4 Arena is backwards compatible with XBONE and the new Series consoles, but not Ultimax
[0:13:42] <%678saintglock> makes sense

[0:14:58] <%swordmanegill> okay I gotta keep animating. But I might be back later to beg Woolie to play my game
[0:14:59] <+natedrago> Honestly P4A is super beginner friendly, wouldn’t be surprised if she picks it up fast

[0:25:34] <Solidnick18> oh
[0:25:34] <Shardlab> They dialed down Joco
[0:25:37] <Applecannon63> You think Reggie is that light?

[0:26:16] <%Dr00_PhD> SFV
[0:26:19] <%X2Eliah> wish*
[0:26:22] <%nicversus> Apparently Shaman King is super popular in Mexico, and a lot of fans friggin love chocolove
[0:26:25] <TimetodiveLTX> i've gotten people say the sun was in their eyes... twice
[0:26:25] <%Qualityhugeweeb> yeah that news is cool and all but Anno is making a Shin Kamen Rider movie woolieGASM woolieGASM woolieGASM

[0:27:20] <+DenpaDev> Our child reggied
[0:27:26] <%Dr00_PhD> and a Kamen Rider Black remake
[0:27:26] <Sartastic> Zio boys da best
[0:27:26] <jorniev> SHIN KAMEN RIDER has a trenchcoat
[0:27:26] <Applecannon63> and no its not Kamen Rider Shin
[0:27:26] <%678saintglock> shin kamen rider indeed
[0:27:33] <icyjiub> rpcs3 runs it really damn well, but its hard to get it to scale without filtering the sprites
[0:27:35] <%AlteisenReiseZ> I emulate the PS3 version
[0:27:35] <GarbageNirvana> Oh hey punchmom stream
[0:27:37] <Qu1ckyyy> P4AU should get ported to steam 100%
[0:27:38] <+b_aleph> Universe can't handle tiny Reggie
[0:27:44] <OldManDeckardCain> melty blood got another game before p5 LUL
[0:27:53] <+nemtehe> WE LOVE SMALL REGGIE

[0:28:11] <+Jiggisnipe> Hakan
[0:28:11] <%Dr00_PhD> lot's of cool KR shit getting announced this week
[0:28:12] <%DrJamesWoods> Tiny reggie
[0:28:13] <+Grim1952> GG is infamous for that, i still miss bridget
[0:28:17] <+the22cstomp> answer is never coming back :(
[0:28:25] <Mathochism> I play ABA and Answer. It hurts.
[0:28:25] <goldenjogador> the biggest smol reggie of all time
[0:28:25] <jobin_stream> small reggae on Woolies shoulder
[0:28:27] <%kewlmyc> Feels good being a Rashid fan
[0:28:32] <Darren716> Hakan is dead forever
[0:28:37] <+emstinima> Zappa Guilty Gear moment
[0:28:40] <+the22cstomp> rashid is an insta lock forever in every game
[0:28:40] <+Jiggisnipe> surprised C Viper isn't playbale
[0:28:43] <NotHereToStream> necalli the jobber
[0:28:44] <%Qualityhugeweeb> I await PunchMom Tekken God Rank
[0:28:44] <+Jiggisnipe> playable*
[0:28:45] <%DrJamesWoods> Juri Han Kreygasm
[0:28:46] <Applecannon63> CVIPER…
[0:28:49] <MKII> bottom of the popularity poll characters :(
[0:28:54] <+FuqBoiSlim> Street Fighter needed more Girlbosses
[0:28:54] <%patriotrenegade> C Viper tho
[0:28:57] <DatAsuna> Reggie is the Dead Weight
[0:29:00] <%ggbhtg> and she was a Jojo reference
[0:29:02] <+MauriceFaurron> Hakan needs to be back tho
[0:29:03] <Arek_1> Juri became the new face of Street Fighter.
[0:29:03] <stabbityrabbit> The only way Necalli comes back is if Darkstalkers comes back from the dead. He'd fit way better in that series.
[0:29:13] <%jinking79> never gonna get Rick back
[0:29:13] <@Menitta> I can see C Viper coming back
[0:29:13] <Darren716> Somehow Rufus is even deader than Hakan
[0:29:18] <Shardlab> @stabbityrabbit True
[0:29:21] <dds333a> Time for Fitegames
[0:29:22] <Applecannon63> C Viper is the closest of a KOF character…
[0:29:24] <%illtima> That's me with NiCO from DOA6
[0:29:28] <%Qualityhugeweeb> Y'all think Falke is coming back? LUL
[0:29:30] <brunoberserk> oh yeah, when i played KOF 2002 with K9999 , i KNOW that dude was never coming back
[0:29:32] <Toni_Master43> God I hope my boy Sin comes back
[0:29:32] <%kewlmyc> Sin will probably be DLC at least
[0:29:34] <%DrJamesWoods> Needed juri for the foot fetishests
[0:29:37] <%jinking79> stuck in real bout forever
[0:29:39] <jetjagger222> RIP yashamaru mains
[0:29:39] <+Jiggisnipe> @Qualityhugeweeb no
[0:29:40] <%DrJamesWoods> *fetishists
[0:29:42] <+b_aleph> SinHAS GOT TO come back in the first season pass
[0:29:49] <%swordmanegill> Woolie thanks to you, we tried using Parsec for our fighting game and it worked near to perfectly. Playing from Iceland to Poland!
[0:29:52] <dds333a> Real Bout, if you will

[0:30:45] <+SmeeblesVro> Button mash OSFrog
[0:30:47] <dds333a> But that was only the case for me
[0:30:50] <%jinking79> Get Into Training Mode
[0:30:57] <+Grim1952> P4AU systems overwhelm me
[0:31:07] <khalcatto> overthink a lil
[0:31:07] <+the22cstomp> wu is never coming back though
[0:31:34] <DatAsuna> Well the gist of my dono was "Don't expect to learn it all up front, first you learn how to learn."
[0:31:44] <Sartastic> I played Clayfighter 2 20 years ago\
[0:31:51] <dds333a> Enter Punchmom
[0:31:51] <Solidnick18> LUL
[0:31:53] <+nemtehe> Fantasy Strike got me into fighting games, thanks to your video. Sadly, I'm a wifi warrior
[0:31:57] <Brand_M1_AK> LuL
[0:32:00] <+MauriceFaurron> LUL
[0:32:03] <DatAsuna> Ey my first too
[0:32:05] <@Solidus_113> people who know the secret moves (specials)
[0:32:05] <NotHereToStream> first thing to learn in fighting game: BLOCK
[0:32:09] <UnfilteredComic> "I want to get into Tekken" vs "I want to get into Uni:Clr"
[0:32:17] <FrostedZaibatsu> I play Among Us professionally. I want to get into fighting games
[0:32:19] <+TheBigO75> Is that punch mom?
[0:32:22] <@Solidus_113> yes
[0:32:22] <DatAsuna> I remember as a kid having to ask people how fatalities worked
[0:32:35] <%Mtome> My dad got into tekken, he used to wipe the floor with his Feng, but now I am the big boi of the house
[0:32:51] <dds333a> @solidus_113 *throws out a Lv.1 Super* This dude knows the SECRET MOVES!
[0:33:01] <Jontman42> weirdly enough For Honor was an easy "just try it" entry into learning  about the genre, despite how different it is
[0:33:04] <@Menitta> THE SECRET MOVES
[0:33:12] <OldManDeckardCain> "You can break throws???"
[0:33:14] <@Menitta> awwwwwww
[0:33:17] <Sartastic> the first time you beat your dad at a video game BibleThump
[0:33:18] <@Solidus_113> killers stay HOME
[0:33:22] <DatAsuna> @dds333a the original joke was even funnier, it wasn't even a super, it was just doing a hadouken
[0:33:24] <Applecannon63> Secret Cancels
[0:33:26] <stormhawk9891> KILLERS GO HOME
[0:33:27] <+natedrago> o we labbing?
[0:33:29] <%Mtome> @Sartastic It's pure euphoria
[0:33:51] <0cash> put the arcade sticks down boys
[0:33:53] <@Menitta> idc, I still wanna play this. I'm gonna go into one of the lobbies.
[0:33:54] <Shardlab> The kumite?! doodNuts
[0:33:58] <%X2Eliah> Yeah ofc
[0:33:58] <+Jiggisnipe> @natedrago naw teaching
[0:34:02] <+emstinima> My brother and ! thought E Honda was top tier in SF2 bc we couldn't get past his rapidjab
[0:34:04] <DatAsuna> Get Into Story Mode
[0:34:10] <+Grim1952> Have fun Punchmom
[0:34:11] <%Mtome> Anybody wanna play it in parsec during the stream???
[0:34:17] <dds333a> I wonder who'll be first pick
[0:34:29] <Applecannon63> CPU Fighters are designed to be goofy
[0:34:32] <%JaseAdrift> For Noobs
[0:34:34] <GarbageNirvana> what if I'm not a newcomer but I may as well be because of all the bad habits I picked up
[0:34:34] <%X2Eliah> Might need a "training dummy" 2nd player as opponent to lab and learn some basics before going to CPU
[0:34:35] <FrostedZaibatsu> Fighting a CPU for training is good. Anything that doesnt stand still is
[0:34:37] <DatAsuna> It's Woolie, Punchmom and their son Reggie
[0:34:38] <dds333a> @datasuna yeah, I'm aware
[0:34:52] <dds333a> @datasuna also, lul
[0:34:52] <dmtjinni> HYPE

[0:45:54] <Crippl3> the correct answer is yosuke
[0:45:57] <+nemtehe> Adachi!
[0:45:58] <+HideFromSkeletons> yosuke is my training dummy
[0:45:58] <+SmeeblesVro> I’d main Kasumi or Yusuke frame 1 hggWoke
[0:46:00] <Solidnick18> beat up adachi
[0:46:01] <dds333a> @applecannon63 Baofu is there too
[0:46:19] <%freystreams> if i remember correctly, adachi has a joker colour
[0:46:24] <@Menitta> P5 Arena would have big rushdown Makoto
[0:46:28] <%Buttface_> moopokeJams moopokeJams moopokeJams moopokeJams
[0:46:28] <jorniev> P5 arena youske looks like he peaked in high school
[0:46:37] <%Buttface_> moopokeShabTime moopokeShabTime moopokeShabTime moopokeShabTime
[0:46:41] <dds333a> Other Atlus games also have the All Gold character GG reference
[0:46:48] <Blaven2> Wht does the goofy cop have Yu's persona? blaven1Think
[0:46:49] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> THE LAB
[0:46:51] <%munitalprats> A MANS MAN
[0:46:57] <+emstinima> Adachi the BABY SourPls
[0:46:57] <Solidnick18> SourPls
[0:47:02] <stabbityrabbit> Oh my god, would Ryuji be unga or grappler in P5Arena? I'm playing him either way.
[0:47:06] <Darren716> >The egocentric police dick
[0:47:07] <mothdude> The Police Dick! (but I repeat myself)
[0:47:19] <Applecannon63> ACAB
[0:47:19] <+loukemia83> oooo playing on stick eh?
[0:47:21] <%Dr00_PhD> I NEED P5A Yusuke to jut be Vergil like he i in P5S
[0:47:22] <+nemtehe> we need a behelit for persona 5 arena
[0:47:23] <+SmeeblesVro> Ryuji would be unga
[0:47:25] <Crippl3> ryuji is 100% unga
[0:47:26] <%xXVeggiePLusXx> Damn we need a P5A
[0:47:27] <%Buttface_> KANJI TUTORIAL: DP, 214D, J.B
[0:47:44] <+Grim1952> Unless you're potemkim
[0:47:46] <+MattOfTheSea> yo did she just IAD
[0:47:49] <dds333a> @nemtehe Yeah, I don't see it happening at all
[0:47:52] <HaxDotCombo> and it's not the police dick Kanji wants because it's not attached to Naoto
[0:47:52] <%jinking79> watched Simmons play P4 ps2  he fuckin hated it like the soundtrack
[0:47:55] <buttlets1> I love the knowledge check that is kanji IK
[0:48:04] <+nemtehe> @dds333a :(
[0:48:06] <@Solidus_113> farther away
[0:48:06] <+emstinima> God "A Fool or A Clown" is the perfect Adachi theme
[0:48:19] <%Buttface_> @buttlets1 hope you're ready to see me knowledge check on stream
[0:48:19] <%munitalprats> nah thats definitely an attack
[0:48:26] <icebanchou> its a fullscreen
[0:48:26] <%munitalprats> that's him calling a lightning bolt down
[0:48:28] <+FuqBoiSlim> @jinking79 was it too anime for him? lol
[0:48:34] <@Solidus_113> full screen zio
[0:48:38] <dds333a> It's just way past him, that's all
[0:48:42] <%jinking79> pretty much
[0:48:51] <GohansBeforeHohans> @jinking79 He shoulda played Golden
[0:48:53] <buttlets1> @Buttface_ very ready. what're they playing on? I've always wanted to get into this game but emulating it is a pain in the ass
[0:49:05] <%Buttface_> I'm playing on PS3
[0:49:08] <dds333a> Yeah, she's getting it
[0:49:10] <+allups> punch momma
[0:49:11] <%Buttface_> have been since release
[0:49:19] <%Buttface_> they are too
[0:49:20] <buttlets1> mmh
[0:49:27] <+FuqBoiSlim> @jinking79 that's pretty weird cuz I remember him liking xenoblade 2 a bit. unless I'm misremembering
[0:49:32] <+AnoTheWinter> Is that Gokudeira? the best Brazillian BBTAG player?
[0:49:34] <+AnoTheWinter> god damn
[0:49:36] <buttlets1> sadly the PS4 isn't back-compatible
[0:49:57] <buttlets1> so I would need to get a PS3 in order to play this, and the game doesn't seem to come cheap
[0:50:13] <Applecannon63> Simmon not into the hokey school theme?
[0:50:17] <+Jiggisnipe> @FuqBoiSlim Simmons doesn't like Japanese school life stuff
[0:50:18] <leith_aziz> @FuqBoiSlim: Simmons does not like the Highschool aesthetic type of anime
[0:50:21] <%trustycoyote> Saw it click in her head doodOK
[0:50:28] <dds333a> The button change paradigm
[0:50:31] <@Menitta> yeah I hate the SNK straight line arcade stick layout
[0:50:32] <%freystreams> yeaaaah, the price of ps3 exclusive games will go further up in price now due to the psn store shutting down. if you want to get this game, now would be a good time to look
[0:50:32] <leith_aziz> Not saying I agree though
[0:50:49] <stormhawk9891> @FuqBoiSlim Simmons doesn't like alot of things
[0:50:57] <Arek_1> Yeah, type B for MvC3.
[0:51:07] <+glgzephyr> S H O C K  S T A T E
[0:51:07] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:51:15] <metabot64> why play this when jump force exist Kappa
[0:51:19] <DedlokPM> Or you could pick up a game, not bother learning the controls, and then complain about how you used up all your potions because you are used to a button being Heavy Attack rooSmug
[0:51:29] <%ggbhtg> Simmons is a school teacher, and was also home schooled. He was no emotional attachment to get sucked into High School anime
[0:51:43] <RWLJr98> Who is woman? Is this wife?
[0:51:49] <dds333a> YE
[0:51:50] <OkamiDude15> is wife yes
[0:51:50] <%678saintglock> yea
[0:51:55] <+SmeeblesVro> Oh yeah this game had status effects damn this was way ahead of its time dotodoHUH
[0:52:01] <DedlokPM> @RWLJr98 Fiancee yes
[0:52:06] <Applecannon63> Kanji is unga Potempkin with Ky Kiske bolts
[0:52:32] <dds333a> @smeeblesvro other games have had them, but they did a great job implementing the SMT standard in fighting game context
[0:52:35] <metabot64> guilty gear had stuff like status effects already
[0:52:44] <gamefan6219> Bruh we better get persona 5 arena
[0:52:45] <+Zero_Jacks> man i wish i was here at the start
[0:52:48] <+glgzephyr> appropriately broken combo for this game @Applecannon63
[0:52:51] <dds333a> I just wish Charm didn't just rob a bit of SP
[0:52:52] <metabot64> baikens seals,  testaments curse
[0:52:53] <leith_aziz> Woolie is married ? I really didnt know
[0:53:16] <%ChoculaUltra> my head canon has Reggie as your typical disembodied AI voice coming from the glowing lights behind the couch
[0:53:19] <+glgzephyr> engaged, actually
[0:53:22] <+FuqBoiSlim> there hasn't been a wedding yet they've been engaged for a minute now
[0:53:36] <+TheotherKristian> at least a minute
[0:53:41] <leith_aziz> Well, ist not my bussines anyway, so I'll not go into it
[0:53:43] <%678saintglock> reggie’s jarvis ?
[0:53:43] <RWLJr98> 60 whole seconds
[0:53:45] <leith_aziz> *its
[0:53:58] <+nemtehe> tiny reggie pls
[0:53:59] <+MoonmanDel> I haven't been around in a while. Is that punchmom?
[0:54:03] <MidnightPacif1c> t h e s h o c k s t a t e
[0:54:10] <OkamiDude15> @MoonmanDel yeah
[0:54:11] <+nemtehe> @MoonmanDel yea
[0:54:12] <DedlokPM> @MoonmanDel yes
[0:54:21] <+FuqBoiSlim> sí
[0:54:25] <+beanieboi420> Will this work physically only? Cuz I have it digitally but it's not seeming to want to launch ;-;
[0:54:26] <leith_aziz> Speaking of persona, SugarPunch released a new video on Yukiko. I didnt know of that Pat clip, oof
[0:54:39] <+emstinima> Time to learn the Anime Numpad(tm)
[0:54:42] <metabot64> the lightning status was so akward to deal with.  the short hop mechanically was new to me
[0:54:42] <+loukemia83> Octogates 2020, it's the future
[0:54:47] <%xXVeggiePLusXx> So no octogates huh? Kappa
[0:54:52] <leith_aziz> Will online still work with PS3 games later down the road
[0:54:57] <leith_aziz> ?
[0:55:03] <%Buttface_> @beanieboi420 game should work fine digitally
[0:55:09] <stormhawk9891> Personally I actually hate square gates since they feel really restrictive
[0:55:14] <%Buttface_> played it with friends online like two days ago
[0:55:21] <+glgzephyr> @leith_aziz The boys have something of a history with P4 and lousy takes
[0:55:22] <metabot64> so people have shadow forms in this version right?
[0:55:23] <@Menitta> I need a new square gate
[0:55:30] <OkamiDude15> @metabot64 yup
[0:55:32] <%ChoculaUltra> I think online functionality will persist at least - iirc FF14 on PS3 still plays right?
[0:55:47] <HaxDotCombo> is diamond gate a thing?  Like square gate rotated 45 degrees o.o
[0:55:48] <leith_aziz> Some games use servers so thats up to the devs
[0:55:54] <%Buttface_> online will still work after the store goes down
[0:55:57] <leith_aziz> Some games simply are peer to peer
[0:55:59] <@Menitta> I remember at Evo when this game was there, a Marvel player dominated with Shadow Mitsuru
[0:56:00] <+Bladeviper> no ps3 for 14 doesnt work anymore
[0:56:04] <%ChoculaUltra> ah I see
[0:56:09] <%Buttface_> @haxdotcombo that would be actually useless as it would eliminate diagonals
[0:56:13] <Applecannon63> How wild if the next Persona Fighter was made by French Bread instead of Arcsys?
[0:56:17] <+Bladeviper> they took it offline with the 2nd xpass
[0:56:19] <+beanieboi420> @buttface_ Doesn't seem to work for me...might be something different though, thanks for letting me know.
[0:56:21] <metabot64> isnt shadow naoto some bullshit
[0:56:26] <+glgzephyr> yes
[0:56:32] <%ChoculaUltra> that would actually be insane for Square to have a game that needs to run flawlessly on 3 gens of PS hardware LUL
[0:56:32] <%Buttface_> she's not that good
[0:56:35] <%YeetBoss> this is sweet woolie is showing what he loves to punch mom but im not gonna lie this is so so boring to watch
[0:56:37] <leith_aziz> @Applecannon63: What would be different ?
[0:56:37] <dds333a> she's gotten timing too
[0:56:39] <%Buttface_> she's not bad, but she's still a meme
[0:56:42] <metabot64> like easy set ups for instant kill
[0:56:42] <Sartastic> lol
[0:56:50] <leith_aziz> I thought Shadow characters were bullshit overall
[0:56:50] <%freystreams> @ChoculaUltra yeeeeah, they stopped the xiv service on the ps3 3-4 years ago
[0:56:53] <%Buttface_> nah
[0:57:00] <+SmeeblesVro> @applecannon63 a lot of people were speculating that but they’re putting out melty so maybe? hggShaq
[0:57:01] <%Buttface_> only like 4 shadows are BS
[0:57:05] <%Buttface_> the rest are just bad
[0:57:06] <metabot64> i thought shadow characters sucked overall
[0:57:23] <%Buttface_> naoto, mitsuru, narukami, and yosuke are the only ones worth using
[0:57:29] <leith_aziz> ok, lets elaborate. Who's top 1 in the game ?
[0:57:32] <@Solidus_113> block buttons
[0:57:33] <%Buttface_> ken
[0:57:34] <dds333a> She got the purpose of down block
[0:57:36] <%Buttface_> or yosuke
[0:57:36] <metabot64> akuma
[0:57:38] <Sartastic> nooo they're children
[0:57:39] <metabot64> or oni
[0:57:43] <leith_aziz> Yes, thats how some games do it
[0:57:46] <dds333a> Just not the intricacies
[0:57:47] <%SilverDevilfish> Special Guest star, Reggie's hands Kappa
[0:57:49] <Sartastic> pooo
[0:57:53] <%freystreams> top character is violent ken
[0:57:59] <leith_aziz> Usually, you only see them blocking in games MID attack
[0:57:59] <metabot64> is reggie invisible?
[0:58:06] <Sartastic> WutFace WutFace WutFace WutFace
[0:58:16] <%ChoculaUltra> Reggie digitized himself.
[0:58:16] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:58:20] <metabot64> toppest tier beyond tiers is mugen's dark ronald
[0:58:21] <dds333a> @leith_aziz or if the attacker is close enough
[0:58:23] <+b_aleph> @metabot64 he's shrunk too much
[0:58:23] <LukeZeFoo> atpQuan
[0:58:25] <%Buttface_> ken is the fucked up character that wins all the tournaments, yosuke is theoretically the best but he's held back by yosuke players
[0:58:30] <stormhawk9891> What's a punish Reggie
[0:58:31] <RWLJr98> Woolie killed Reggie, he now haunts the house.
[0:58:35] <@Solidus_113> Beginners don't need to worry much about that
[0:58:36] <+Take_2_shots> Reggie need a VTuber model
[0:58:44] <Sartastic> OhMyDog PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[0:58:45] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[0:58:47] <leith_aziz> @Buttface_: Is Ken the P3 kid ?
[0:58:48] <+FuqBoiSlim> @buttface_ that's such a yosuke ass move
[0:58:52] <+yarcia> TehePelo TehePelo TehePelo TehePelo TehePelo TehePelo TehePelo
[0:58:57] <shubachi> Reggie that's too much info for right now
[0:58:57] <stormhawk9891> What's a hit-nevermind
[0:59:03] <+OblivionSword1> Slow down Reggie
[0:59:05] <metabot64> oh shit i forgot about p3 ken
[0:59:13] <+teh_rawk> koromaru balances ken out so theyre only ok
[0:59:17] <%freystreams> now reggie is gonna explain frame data
[0:59:21] <%gatorafan> Reggie is jumping some steps, I guess being just hands makes that to one
[0:59:24] <+nemtehe> hi punchmom
[0:59:25] <Applecannon63> @leith_aziz The game would have custom Personas thats like Melty Blood's Groove Style(Moons)
[0:59:27] <+FuqBoiSlim> "ay wtf is a whiff punish?"
[0:59:29] <+loukemia83> explaining hitboxes and frame data is where most new people's eyes glaze over
[0:59:29] <metabot64> i thought yall were meming about sf ken in persona
[0:59:30] <+SmeeblesVro> What no Ken was like s tier lmao
[0:59:33] <dds333a> There's an invisible square around you right now
[0:59:35] <Sartastic> mjjkkknjjkjjbbbjbjnktkkjjghjjgbj
[0:59:36] <Solidnick18> yeah
[0:59:39] <%munitalprats> Woolie be like "I Cant believe i married a grappler"
[0:59:39] <+glgzephyr> GET BENT
[0:59:43] <Miles_Stardiver> Later when they introduce her to Skullgirls and Beowulf
[0:59:47] <%Kato__v> Kato__v subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:59:48] <leith_aziz> I just came back from playing DBFZ and lost got demoted from my Living Legend rank 5 TIMES in a row. I think I've gotten tired of the game and fighting a Gogeta (SS4) every damn match
[0:59:52] <feralspidey> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[0:59:52] <Sartastic> gmi
[0:59:59] <Tracazoid> So Punchmom might be a Beowulf player in Skullgirls, for the power of chair
[1:00:07] <stormhawk9891> @WoolieVersus You also have counter hits turned on
[1:00:09] <leith_aziz> I lost the rank, got it back, 5 times in a row
[1:00:14] <dds333a> Always been the case in a series about high schoolers fighting demons and monsters
[1:00:16] <+nemtehe> these sprites are so good
[1:00:46] <feralspidey> back (away from opponent) to block

[1:00:48] <leith_aziz> I heard Adachi's story in Ultimax was pretty good. Though I'd rather not spoil myself
[1:00:55] <+FuqBoiSlim> @leith_aziz dbfz online sounds like hell on earth from all the twitter memes I've seen
[1:00:59] <RWLJr98> I am glad there is a character in a fighting game that fits me and my needs. Ghun man.
[1:01:04] <metabot64> i wonder if theyll ever introduce the fatal hit state.  IIRC make a move super good but you are put into super counter hit state
[1:01:15] <metabot64> kinda an interesting balancing option
[1:01:19] <+Grim1952> Did this game had jumping block?
[1:01:21] <+tigerfang86> he's such a dick
[1:01:26] <dds333a> @leith_aziz it's also really dumb, but it does illuminate more about him, kinda
[1:01:27] <%Buttface_> @grim1952 yes
[1:01:31] <leith_aziz> @FuqBoiSlim: Its delay based. Nothing new. My issue is dealing with the same characters every day
[1:01:45] <%Buttface_> @metabot64 you mean fatal recovery?
[1:01:58] <%Buttface_> some moves are fatal counters and other moves have fatal recovery
[1:02:12] <Sartastic> 123456678901
[1:02:18] <%Buttface_> fatal recovery makes any move that hits it a fatal starter
[1:02:20] <%freystreams> tekken is the biggest rock paper scissor game
[1:02:22] <Applecannon63> It be neat if French Bread made the next Persona fighting Game so they keep the 2D sprite style
[1:02:24] <metabot64> @Buttface_  fatal recovery
[1:02:28] <0cash> Yo, buttface from big youtube star moopoke
[1:02:41] <%Buttface_> yeah that's me
[1:02:54] <%Buttface_> also buttface from evo top4 two years in a row
[1:02:58] <+loukemia83> Block Low React High
[1:03:00] <%Buttface_> moopokeMarie
[1:03:04] <%ChoculaUltra> THE buttface monkaS
[1:03:11] <0cash> yeah, but moopoke youube is much bigger than evo
[1:03:12] <RWLJr98> What are you guys playing while listening to this?
[1:03:16] <+FuqBoiSlim> @leith_aziz it's like a combo of the netcode and the fact that ever dlc character seems like the worst thing in the world.
[1:03:17] <%Buttface_> I'm gonna SCREAM
[1:03:24] <leith_aziz> I mean, I think we need to give every FG some leeway in time, since we've already gotten some new games to try out. Im gonna be busy with Strive this year
[1:03:28] <+FuqBoiSlim> @rwljr98 monstah huntah
[1:03:29] <metabot64> don;t know the actually name but arksys was messing around the concept in BB and this game but sorta stopped introducing that mechanic in their other games
[1:03:46] <RWLJr98> Nice. I’m on Halo 3
[1:03:49] <+b_aleph> @loukemia83 but what if you wanted to do that and Daisuke said:"I-no"?

[1:05:40] <@Moobot> 2178 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[1:05:42] <leith_aziz> @glgzephyr: I dont know man. You can enjoy the netcode and gameplay, but the game has a LOT of issues
[1:05:52] <Applecannon63> Persona Card meter
[1:05:55] <leith_aziz> The critiscm didnt come out of nowhere
[1:06:09] <%CaptainPileDriver> shit just got here
[1:06:21] <nailwind> damn im an hour late for some p4u
[1:06:24] <FunnyCrimes> 90% of them were just the presentation and the lack of x-men
[1:06:27] <stormhawk9891> Only Yukiko
[1:06:32] <+Zero_Jacks> only yuk
[1:06:35] <%Buttface_> this game has recoverable blue life
[1:06:35] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Only one character can do that
[1:06:36] <dds333a> In some cases
[1:06:42] <odd_slater> As someone that defended KOF XIV I understand where Infinite players come from but presentation goes a long way
[1:06:47] <%CaptainPileDriver> and I'm assuming this is on ps3 right
[1:06:48] <%Buttface_> yukiko, Elizabeth, margaret, and Ken can heal
[1:06:52] <%Buttface_> not just yukiko
[1:06:53] <RWLJr98> I never played a persona game before. They good?
[1:06:54] <dds333a> "Grey life" applies sometimes
[1:07:01] <+SmeeblesVro> Can’t Ken heal too?
[1:07:04] <+OblivionSword1> Yukiko does have Dia
[1:07:07] <Darren716> Shut up Woolie, the laugh is great
[1:07:07] <Calek> @RWLJr98 they're ok, long and bloated
[1:07:10] <+RichardMF_> this game has blue life also
[1:07:10] <dds333a> She was a healer in game too
[1:07:11] <shiibbae> oh its buttface, perfect for this stream
[1:07:13] <+Story_Ark> @rwljr98 hell yeah. persona games friggin rule
[1:07:27] <+MattOfTheSea> @RWLJr98 yessir, some of my favorite games of all time
[1:07:27] <%Buttface_> ye I came for the eventual bully session
[1:07:29] <+Wolfman_Cometh> I just tuned in what I miss?
[1:07:33] <dds333a> Also, the laugh sucks, it's really akward
[1:07:36] <leith_aziz> @FunnyCrimes: Content is very lacking, presentation is akward, small roster for a MVC game (with not really a good excuse for having a small roster like with GG), etc
[1:07:42] <+Story_Ark> didnt miss much, besides everyone agreeing that chie is the best
[1:07:46] <shiibbae> are you going to haze with kanji
[1:07:48] <FunnyCrimes> @leith_aziz but its fun tho
[1:07:49] <+RichardMF_> @wolfman_cometh you missed punch mom first combo
[1:07:49] <+glgzephyr> @RWLJr98 If you like JRPGs, you'll probably love Persona
[1:07:49] <RWLJr98> Duality of man
[1:07:56] <+Wolfman_Cometh> I hear no lies. Aw man!
[1:07:59] <dds333a> @rwljr98 yes, they're pretty alright.
[1:07:59] <%CaptainPileDriver> time to dig out the ps3
[1:08:07] <@Solidus_113> not today cap
[1:08:08] <%Buttface_> maybe
[1:08:13] <@Solidus_113> we're here to train

[1:08:15] <%Buttface_> I did last time on his birthday
[1:08:17] <0cash> No parsec today for those interested
[1:08:24] <xpakeo> no fight, only game
[1:08:25] <%CaptainPileDriver> ooooh, well, then back to mhw
[1:08:28] <DaKnightWarrior> The heart of the cards
[1:08:30] <%Buttface_> PS3s don't have parsec
[1:08:31] <dds333a> She could punish that
[1:08:32] <+LeaIsChill> Parsec on PS3 LUL
[1:08:33] <%Buttface_> so yeah
[1:08:38] <leith_aziz> WANT SOME!!!

[1:09:18] <dds333a> Woolie is the main

[1:09:59] <BackwardCap> New sub alert gildedNut
[1:10:04] <%Buttface_> unless they play margaret
[1:10:08] <%Buttface_> then it never happens
[1:10:11] <dds333a> A good bit
[1:10:14] <%Buttface_> 8 card looking ass
[1:10:14] <shiibbae> never ever ever
[1:10:15] <sleepy_pixels> !uptime
[1:10:15] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 10 minutes
[1:10:19] <@Menitta> unLESS THEY PLAY MARGARET
[1:10:22] <%JFrostyBeats> or sho
[1:10:22] <dds333a> You get good to make it stop happening
[1:10:31] <%CaptainPileDriver> margaret has 8 fuck that
[1:10:49] <%Buttface_> she has 8 and they come back as fast as if she had 4
[1:10:56] <%Fiiib> doesn't margaret straight up die if she losses all cards?
[1:11:01] <+the22cstomp> never have to worry about persona break if you play personaless sho
[1:11:04] <Applecannon63> Margaret is meant to be a boss
[1:11:12] <+logoth_> B U R S T
[1:11:13] <%Buttface_> she doesn't die, but she doesn't have any combos
[1:11:17] <stabbityrabbit> Yeah, this stream is the exact experience I've had teaching fighting games to all my friends. Goes to show how far a decent tutorial could take the genre.
[1:11:30] <Solidnick18> it's hey get off me
[1:11:31] <laserbeaming> I forgot how much this game doesn't care about spoilers
[1:11:54] <dds333a> @stabbityrabbit this game has one, and it's serviceable, but Punchmom wantes training
[1:11:56] <leith_aziz> @stabbityrabbit Decent toturials exist. The issue is making them appealing/encouraging
[1:11:57] <Applecannon63> spoilers but out of context
[1:12:04] <$razielhex> eccentric dick
[1:12:06] <xpakeo> bbtag is what spoiled me on p4 funnily
[1:12:11] <leith_aziz> Usually people dont wanna bother with reading menu's
[1:12:11] <0cash> honestly someone teaching you is way more interesting than a tutorial anyway
[1:12:16] <leith_aziz> Or a list of text
[1:12:24] <%Buttface_> to be fair this game is literally a sequel, just like p5s
[1:12:24] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1376753284791296000
[1:12:25] <stormhawk9891> @WoolieVersus No it means IK is ready
[1:12:27] <dds333a> It's for IK
[1:13:34] <yoush03> to bad you won't be able to buy this game in a few months :(
[1:13:39] <shiibbae> hearing reggie talk ab meter is ironic seeing as he never uses it
[1:13:39] <stabbityrabbit> @stabbityrabbit That's exactly what I mean. Tutorials exist but rarely exist in any interesting capacity.
[1:13:41] <%SirCacaPee> VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea
[1:13:46] <+Story_Ark> @yoush03 or get any dlc even if you have it physically
[1:14:16] <+SmeeblesVro> You gave punch mom a qanba pearl? That is Pog
[1:14:18] <0cash> hopefully that pushes it for a rerelease... but im being optimistic here
[1:14:31] <dds333a> Awakening has a bit of health bar change appearance change, and a stinger
[1:14:37] <%JFrostyBeats> uless you use mind charge with Elizabeth
[1:14:40] <+Story_Ark> same, p4a needs to be experienced by more peoppe
[1:14:42] <leith_aziz> @stabbityrabbit: I think Rev 2's mission mode is actually pretty interesting since it gives you the situation that you can improve in. Also has matchup toturials
[1:14:42] <dds333a> And then all the gameplay stuff
[1:14:43] <+Story_Ark> *people
[1:14:47] <SonicD4> 4 downs
[1:14:54] <+teh_rawk> 3 downs
[1:14:58] <%Buttface_> 3
[1:15:01] <dds333a> They're much easier than GG
[1:15:01] <+natedrago> 3
[1:15:03] <@Menitta> there it is
[1:15:04] <shiibbae> the makings of a monster
[1:15:14] <leith_aziz> I'd try P4A games if they came to PC with Rollback
[1:15:16] <+Zero_Jacks> The BIG Hype
[1:15:18] <yoush03> I've actually been Playing it through Emulation and Parsec, runs like console for me :)
[1:15:21] <dds333a> WAY OF A MAN
[1:15:23] <%CaptainPileDriver> instant kill no matter what if hits, awesome
[1:15:24] <DaKnightWarrior> Super Cool.
[1:15:29] <+Jiggisnipe> lol
[1:15:31] <+SmeeblesVro> Woolie you have to change the ik theme to Fog pls hggGasm
[1:15:32] <yoush03> and now I'm morally justified!
[1:15:32] <+Story_Ark> BRO FIST
[1:15:34] <@Menitta> you can only do it on a winning round
[1:15:37] <Annat3l> we're not GGX LUL
[1:15:38] <Miles_Stardiver> Kinda reminds me of FotN's Fatal KOs
[1:15:43] <%CaptainPileDriver> on the winning round for you
[1:15:44] <+Story_Ark> show adachi!
[1:15:45] <%Buttface_> last round, 100 meter
[1:15:45] <Miles_Stardiver> Well, it has that energy, anyway
[1:15:48] <@Menitta> And you need 100 meter
[1:15:53] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> Winning Round and it costs 100 meter
[1:16:00] <+Mordexai0> SHOW ADACHIS
[1:16:04] <+Story_Ark> show adachis IK!
[1:16:05] <dds333a> @miles_stardiver Arcsys does what they do
[1:16:08] <stormhawk9891> @WoolieVersus Match ending round and full meter
[1:16:11] <Annat3l> does it not have any hp requirements for the opponent in this game?
[1:16:26] <Miles_Stardiver> Oh, fucking duh. I forgot they were both Arcsys
[1:16:27] <+Grim1952> He brings you down with him
[1:16:45] <Garrett1405> Welcome to the Goop realm
[1:16:49] <dds333a> The static is perfect
[1:17:01] <+Mordexai0> Adachi the big and best douchebag
[1:17:04] <stormhawk9891> @Annat3l Nope
[1:17:07] <+Story_Ark> kanji is fuckin dead
[1:17:13] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> Ah adachi, the most spoiled antagonist in Persona history.
[1:17:16] <chaoterry> epic gamer timeee
[1:17:18] <Heefnoff> Adachi got my favorite normal throw in fighting games
[1:17:18] <Qu1ckyyy> 1vs1 vs Reggie?
[1:17:18] <$Giothegame> Do people still play this online?
[1:17:20] <Explodincatz> same

[1:18:20] <+b_aleph> Reggie, how did they shrink you???
[1:18:20] <leith_aziz> Is this song an original or a remix?
[1:18:23] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> This game was a bit of a mixed bag.
[1:18:27] <DracaenaLeaf> Persona 3/Elizabeth closure when??
[1:18:27] <dds333a> Original
[1:18:28] <DaKnightWarrior> No Killers
[1:18:29] <RWLJr98> I only have played Injustice games
[1:18:31] <+OblivionSword1> @WoolieVersus how do you consistently do motions for moves ?
[1:18:31] <%CaptainPileDriver> why are shoto characters so boring and why does reggie like dry white bread
[1:18:32] <+Story_Ark> @rwljr98 could that possibly be a reference to the japanese manga and anime franchise, Joseph Joestar's strange adventure?
[1:18:33] <DatAsuna> how would you even parsec this anyway? emulator??
[1:18:35] <shiibbae> oh yea understandable
[1:18:42] <pmda2126> a wild reggie appears
[1:18:43] <+MattOfTheSea> @DatAsuna yeah
[1:18:44] <+DarkNerdShawny> @datasuna yes
[1:18:44] <+loukemia83> The goal is not to scare them away
[1:18:46] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> @DracaenaLeaf Never. It's not meant to have closure.
[1:18:51] <+ghostfaceninja_> practice makes perfect
[1:18:53] <Applecannon63> Shoto are fun tho
[1:18:59] <dds333a> @story_ark The disrespect
[1:19:01] <0cash> @DatAsuna Yep
[1:19:03] <+natedrago> for sho
[1:19:17] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> its like riding a bike get used to it
[1:19:23] <%Jetzord> Jetzord subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! Hey Woolie, thanks for covering Tekken GBA. It holds a special place in my heart because it was the first fighting game I ever played
[1:19:23] <DracaenaLeaf> @Sonny_FIRESTORM didn't Ultimax give Elizabeth something to do?
[1:19:26] <Tracazoid> Muscle memory I guess, you eventually just start to get a hang of it without thinking after doing it enough
[1:19:26] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:19:27] <RWLJr98> I play mainly survival games so I judge you fighting game players hard.
[1:19:27] <+glgzephyr> Please explain why Megafist (counter) -> Megafist -> Megafist is a combo
[1:19:32] <+BlaklyteTV> @woolieversus Just want to say thank you for putting out video like this. It’s a good thing to bring new people into the community.
[1:19:35] <+b_aleph> Any tips for getting consistent diagonal inputs on pad?
[1:19:39] <asakura_ayase> A lot of it is muscle memory
[1:19:41] <MiraiNoUsagi> its there any preference on control types, or its just what fits you best?
[1:19:48] <%jinking79> Charge Characters r easier on fight stick/Hitbox
[1:19:54] <dds333a> Yeah, really the timing is harder than the input
[1:19:57] <T_Sasquatch> its not the same at all LUL
[1:19:57] <+Story_Ark> lotus juice in the background
[1:20:01] <%LastHazzerd> tiny reggie
[1:20:02] <TheOriginalMyth> Am just as baby, my Q:  How do you so quickly know what attack an opponent is doing and know how to stop it. Every happens so fast. Just know all moves by hear for every character?
[1:20:04] <dds333a> Some are really precise with the input too
[1:20:05] <leith_aziz> This is for new players: When you get a sign showing from middle to back, all the way to forward (half circle) you start with back, then just sweep to forward like a half circle
[1:20:08] <TheFramedWarlock> Personally I just do the motions in training mode and do them over and over until I can do it 10 times in a row on either side
[1:20:09] <%DrJamesWoods> On break right now?
[1:20:12] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> @DracaenaLeaf Not that I know of. Also, Ultimax was writen mainly by the Arksys peeps, so obviously the story ain't very solid.
[1:20:12] <+Story_Ark> yeah my biggest issue with fighting games is timing.
[1:20:15] <CastellanVon> Don't just do training mode! You have to be able to do it in a match where it matters.
[1:20:15] <+Grim1952> DPs on d-pad are the bane of my existance
[1:20:16] <Qu1ckyyy> Hey woolie a question, what is Super Cancel into Super? I've heard of it a lot but I still don't understand it.
[1:20:18] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus It's cool that this is a game Punchmom would care more because of prior contact with Persona, but wouldn't SF2 or Alpha be a little easier for her to learn the basics? This is a great format btw!
[1:20:19] <OkamiDude15> @DrJamesWoods quick bathroom break
[1:20:19] <%trustycoyote> LUL
[1:20:23] <shubachi> how do you start playing a game? you do the tutorial, you do some training, get your ass handed to you in an online match, then never play the game again
[1:20:23] <%Buttface_> DRINKING SNACKS???
[1:20:25] <FunnyCrimes> @glgzephyr heard the combat designer plays pot
[1:20:25] <@Solidus_113> some people have better motion luck using D-Pads, some have better on Analog Stick
[1:20:50] <BonnieBigPlays> howdy
[1:20:51] <primaryfire> she rechargin
[1:20:51] <@Menitta> yo we in Junes Magician lobby
[1:20:52] <RWLJr98> Sabotaging herself
[1:20:52] <%DrJamesWoods> @DrJamesWoods Seems like a cheese break
[1:20:54] <+MattOfTheSea> im a weirdo and switch between analog stick and dpad whenever i play on pad
[1:20:59] <Vinsfeld13> @solidus_113 Pretty much it. I learned playing on a pad on PS1 era
[1:21:05] <TheFramedWarlock> Analog ? WutFace
[1:21:05] <+StrawberryPantsu> Or Mixbox :^)
[1:21:06] <xpakeo> supernoon plays/played analog for dbfz
[1:21:17] <LoneFonte> @MattOfTheSea same, sometimes what matters is the character to me
[1:21:18] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> How to Persona 4 Arena: spend 30 minutes straight in training mode. (it's even a trophy in the first one) LUL
[1:21:26] <Heefnoff> DBFZ only has quarter circles to be fair @xpakeo
[1:21:26] <laserbeaming> The Analog Stick is a trap
[1:21:28] <+Story_Ark> ive played fighting games forever and i still cant get the handle of jt
[1:21:29] <leith_aziz> Pad is still a solid option. Just so you know
[1:21:29] <+Story_Ark> *it
[1:21:34] <RWLJr98> I have a cheap stick. I only bought it to feel cool while playing Injustice 2
[1:21:37] <BonnieBigPlays> for me it depends on the input
[1:21:39] <%JaseAdrift> using dpad to black is a life saver
[1:21:44] <@Solidus_113> I constantly bounce between both options for specific specials
[1:21:47] <Heefnoff> Play what you're comfortable with, but if you haven't decided yet, use the D-pad
[1:21:52] <dds333a> Interloper Reg
[1:21:54] <0cash> reggie shifting dimensions
[1:22:00] <T_Sasquatch> 3 camssss
[1:22:07] <+loukemia83> I don't have preferences, but Hitbox is legitimately better
[1:22:08] <xpakeo> @Heefnoff movement would still be alot different compared to dpad
[1:22:10] <%CaptainPileDriver> I use the d pad for most things
[1:22:11] <+b_aleph> I changed from analog stick to dpad recently. It was rough but I'm never going back
[1:22:12] <+Story_Ark> do you have to get used to dpad? i tried playing fighting games once with dpad but it felt so awkward
[1:22:15] <stabbityrabbit> Not using the analog stick? Sounds like  coward's talk to me.
[1:22:28] <stormhawk9891> Not really
[1:22:33] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus Shout outs to back in the day trying to learn street fighter with alpha and a control manual, and the way they wrote the motions down made me think it was like a button sequence instead of a motion.
[1:22:35] <@Menitta> Da Pad
[1:22:36] <%DrJamesWoods> DaPad
[1:22:37] <%zeroarturia> zeroarturia subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months! Just got here. What's up guys? Its a crime this game hasn't gotten a ps4 port. Also Hi again Punch Mom!
[1:22:40] <+Grim1952> With the analog i jump by mistake all the time, unplayable
[1:22:41] <%CaptainPileDriver> da a
[1:22:42] <Solidnick18> LUL
[1:22:43] <DatAsuna> So I would down THEN down right THEN right
[1:22:43] <Vinsfeld13> A fightpad helps a lot in this
[1:22:45] <dds333a> Gotta use DaPad
[1:22:46] <DaKnightWarrior> Classic Shiggy
[1:22:48] <%jinking79> and that just learning motion characters
[1:22:49] <DatAsuna> instead of doing a quarter circle lol
[1:22:49] <+Badlands921> what controller is that??
[1:22:52] <FunnyCrimes> its doable my issue was more how easy it is to misinput with analog stick
[1:22:53] <%Buttface_> @datasuna yes
[1:22:56] <leith_aziz> @Story_Ark D.pad is easy once you understand how it works. Just try it out a little
[1:22:58] <%CaptainPileDriver> a fightpad is a good replacement
[1:22:59] <muXPerience> the thumbstick doesn't have restrictor plates like a fighting stick does, hitting directions takes care
[1:23:00] <Heefnoff> Xbox elite V2 by the looks of it @Badlands921
[1:23:03] <%CaptainPileDriver> YEAH
[1:23:08] <+b_aleph> Diagonal tips on DS4? Please?
[1:23:08] <%CaptainPileDriver> CHURN THE BUTTER
[1:23:09] <%cubbywolf> using a dpad hurts my hand so much
[1:23:12] <TheOriginalMyth> Why are sticks use on "Fighting sticks" then. Is it not the same problem?
[1:23:17] <dds333a> 360s yeah
[1:23:20] <Oak_bogle> And while I get tilts and stuff it’s why I’m bad at smash but better at other fighting games cause I love the d pad
[1:23:20] <+Story_Ark> yeah thing is my first console was the ps1 with the dualshock 1 so im not used to dpad
[1:23:25] <%678saintglock> analog stick is only “worse” because the mechanics of it, it has a potential meter (iirc) instead of switches so it’s more likely to make wrong inputs
[1:23:28] <+loukemia83> Using a Dpad gives you blisters
[1:23:33] <laserbeaming> the stick is good for Jack's dumb 360 multiple times move in Tekken
[1:23:37] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> @b_aleph get something else, DS4 has serious drift problems.
[1:23:41] <%CaptainPileDriver> you think your plus, but I'm a grappler main, I'm always churning
[1:23:47] <+StrawberryPantsu> Unless its a gamecumb pad
[1:23:54] <+b_aleph> @cubbywolf you're pressing too hard. It's hard to get rid of that bad habit
[1:23:54] <+glgzephyr> most D Pads cause physical harm
[1:23:57] <+OblivionSword1> Thanks for the insight Woolie and chat
[1:23:57] <MKII> analogue users are crazier than octogate users
[1:24:01] <+b_aleph> @Sonny_FIRESTORM drift on a dpad?
[1:24:08] <@Solidus_113> mechanical D-pads too
[1:24:08] <TheFramedWarlock> @theoriginalmyth Arcade sticks don't work the same way as analog sticks, there's very little distance you need to go before it does the input
[1:24:13] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Have you ever tried the t-shirt over the d-pad trick to avoid blisters?
[1:24:16] <+koalaf1ed> God I will sh I had a woolie when I started lol
[1:24:18] <%CaptainPileDriver> never stop churning, grappler main 4LIFE
[1:24:21] <TheFramedWarlock> It's also a matter of the button layout
[1:24:23] <%LastHazzerd> KoF!
[1:24:24] <%DrJamesWoods> Is PunchMom a master fighting game expert now?
[1:24:25] <+ChancellorOfLights> how 2 walk
[1:24:30] <Miles_Stardiver> Looks like I need to invest in a 6-button pad or an arcade stick then
[1:24:30] <+natedrago> i hate lesson mode tbh
[1:24:32] <xpakeo> grappler mains rise up
[1:24:34] <leith_aziz> Seems like the norm in my opinion
[1:24:37] <shiibbae> @CaptainPileDriver you fool, im always plus if i dp on wakeup
[1:24:37] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> @b_aleph It's mostly on the analog, but yea it's possible to get drift even on d-pad if it's damaged bad enough
[1:24:38] <leith_aziz> Not too much
[1:24:41] <dds333a> no need to fear, it's time you learned this game
[1:24:45] <+loukemia83> Grappler mains deserve the guillotine
[1:24:53] <RWLJr98> Why did woolie/Punch choose this fighting game over others to learn?
[1:24:53] <+loukemia83> stay down
[1:24:55] <leith_aziz> Not everything is required to learn at the start
[1:25:00] <leith_aziz> Learn the basics
[1:25:00] <+Rafraud> Punchmom poggers
[1:25:07] <%DrJamesWoods> Gotta walk before you can air dash
[1:25:07] <%munitalprats> you'd have to grab us in order to put us to the guillotine
[1:25:08] <xpakeo> @RWLJr98 she likes persona
[1:25:11] <Vinsfeld13> @loukemia83 Waldstein mains are heroes tho
[1:25:17] <+FuqBoiSlim> It's punchmom's first day playing fighting games and she's already getting grappler slander. That's crazy
[1:25:19] <@Menitta> oh my god @Buttface_
[1:25:21] <RWLJr98> Guess that’s all you need
[1:25:23] <0cash> @RWLJr98 From what i understand, Punchmon already played p4 before. So familiarity
[1:25:23] <%Buttface_> it me
[1:25:24] <Applecannon63> Don't blame the grapplers blame the game
[1:25:30] <+MajorCrasher> getting destroyed is also not very fun
[1:25:33] <+Story_Ark> ive never used a dpad before, how do you get used to using one for fighting games?
[1:25:35] <%Buttface_> jiyuPositive
[1:25:37] <@Menitta> man just boddied me
[1:25:42] <%Buttface_> I mean
[1:25:42] <Darren716> This will be on the test

[1:26:00] <TheFramedWarlock> @story_ark There's no other way than playing really
[1:26:00] <%Mattais88> GPA: Game Playing ABility
[1:26:04] <%CaptainPileDriver> grappler mains are the only honest players in the world
[1:26:05] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> Nope, it's a legit tutorial.
[1:26:05] <leith_aziz> I think explaining what moves do in general is also important. Good thing that Strive has that in the move list. Its convinient
[1:26:08] <Nuclearcherries> God I miss this game
[1:26:09] <dds333a> Getting destroyed OFTEN ain't fun, but a good drubbing can be extremely fun
[1:26:12] <%Buttface_> woolie got me into fighting games and now I'm the highest placing american ultimax player two years in a row
[1:26:13] <%DrJamesWoods> Enter the world of teabagging

[1:27:25] <DatAsuna> Not souji seta
[1:27:28] <Vinsfeld13> I have hopes this game will be ported to PC
[1:27:34] <+Story_Ark> @buttface_ woolie also got me into fighting games! i still suck, but woolie is still cool
[1:27:34] <RWLJr98> @buttface_ jk. I wish I could win things :(
[1:27:35] <@Solidus_113> Yu is a better name
[1:27:45] <DatAsuna> it is
[1:27:47] <+Story_Ark> @woolieversus you gotta show punch mom the p4 anime at some point!
[1:27:48] <Miles_Stardiver> I've been playing on and off for years, and thanks to Woolie and others I'm diving in hard into getting better at them.
[1:27:49] <houseloop3> I bought Arcana Heart 3, Battle Fantasia and Dengeki BFC
[1:27:51] <+Ornightz> his name is P4 protagonist
[1:27:52] <Applecannon63> Yu is just Ky with Ragna Moves
[1:28:04] <%cubbywolf> info overload incoming
[1:28:08] <Applecannon63> well Ragna's Sword
[1:28:10] <+FuqBoiSlim> His name to Pro Tagonist
[1:28:27] <+Story_Ark> his name is chad
[1:28:33] <kevamadi> Man, a lot of Japanese games seem to be REALLY bad about overwhelming you with unnecessary information early on...
[1:28:39] <TheFramedWarlock> "Hey what's your name ?" "Pro" DxCat
[1:28:44] <Heefnoff> Ah, Shujinkou
[1:28:57] <dds333a> @kevamadi they haven't even started yet
[1:29:10] <0cash> big ol' Kou Shujin
[1:29:10] <leith_aziz> @kevamadi: What would your solution be ? Come on
[1:29:18] <%cubbywolf> all fgc game tutorials have more info than you need too start but its also info advance players need
[1:29:19] <dds333a> Punchmom has picked  up on a good number of stuff, tho
[1:29:29] <clack14> Keep the game a secret KomodoHype
[1:29:42] <dds333a> Tandem stuff
[1:29:50] <%cubbywolf> once a match starts it will almost all leave the brain
[1:29:53] <+Story_Ark> can i hire reggie as my coach for fighting games? maybe ill be able to actually do a combo
[1:29:55] <Applecannon63> Make the game basic like SFV Kappa
[1:29:59] <0cash> oh... she meets them overheads...
[1:30:03] <+the22cstomp> she's already better than most fg players she's actually blocking
[1:30:04] <%Proxzo> Heyo!
[1:30:05] <0cash> welcome
[1:30:08] <%Proxzo> Saturday stream!
[1:30:16] <Miles_Stardiver> Could separate it into sections like Skullgirls/TFH does
[1:30:25] <RWLJr98> Woolie be like “Marriage battle pass requires that you learn fighting games”
[1:30:30] <%Proxzo> Oh, did punchmom finish P4?
[1:30:33] <leith_aziz> Generally, when people jump in thei attack, its an overhead
[1:30:37] <kevamadi> @leith_aziz Umm, not overwhelming people with unnecessary details that they'll inevitably learn the context of on their own...
[1:30:38] <leith_aziz> Thats a genral rule
[1:30:47] <dds333a> The game has neat exclamation points to make it obvious

[1:30:53] <%cubbywolf> blocking is easy just block

[1:36:25] <+loukemia83> You also use the guard button to jump and crouch in Soul Calibur without hitting an attack button
[1:36:27] <dds333a> Some people, just hammer it really, which doesn't work
[1:36:31] <Heefnoff> No problem!

[1:42:21] <$SirGO0SE> PogChamp
[1:42:21] <+SmeeblesVro> @cobalt_phoenix_ yes
[1:42:22] <%cubbywolf> it is a tech but not the only teching
[1:42:22] <Goosenip> Are we finally getting into fighting games?
[1:42:25] <leith_aziz> @cobalt_phoenix_ Teching refers to many different things
[1:42:28] <The_Ombudsman> fuck yea p4u
[1:42:30] <%cubbywolf> you can also tech grabs
[1:42:31] <Applecannon63> C O U N T E R
[1:42:49] <%cubbywolf> in terms of fgc lingo
[1:42:52] <dds333a> This also kinda advanced, yeah
[1:43:04] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @cobalt_phoenix_ oh ok thank you. youd think after seeing a few of these streams i'd get more lol
[1:43:14] <leith_aziz> With some games, hitting with a counter attack can change properties and give bigger combos, for example, GG does this
[1:43:28] <+cubbywolf> its simple but hard to grasp as a whole
[1:43:37] <+SmeeblesVro> Gg strive counter go brrr
[1:43:46] <%cubbywolf> COUNTER
[1:43:46] <dds333a> You know, you're more vulnerable when you're already going through the motion to hit, like in boxing
[1:44:01] <gunstars20> ZIODYNE
[1:44:03] <%cubbywolf> we winning evo now lads
[1:44:03] <leith_aziz> My DBFZ PTSD is coming up
[1:44:11] <dds333a> There you
[1:44:16] <dds333a> go
[1:44:16] <leith_aziz> Kid Gohan.....
[1:44:28] <%cubbywolf> legs for days
[1:44:34] <+FuqBoiSlim> GOAThan
[1:44:35] <Heefnoff> @leith_aziz Don't worry, auto combos don't just continue if whiffed in this game
[1:44:48] <Heefnoff> This is more like DBFZ's medium autocombo
[1:44:55] <+MrMegaJackpots> woah is that punchmom?
[1:44:57] <leith_aziz> @Heefnoff Really ? Im shocked thats not a thing there
[1:45:10] <Applecannon63> I really wish they nerved the homing auto combos of DBFZ
[1:45:14] <Heefnoff> Yeah, the autocombo continuing if whiffed is specific to DBFZ @leith_aziz
[1:45:18] <Heefnoff> Same @Applecannon63
[1:45:22] <Heefnoff> @AlcoholicBlackGuy Yo!
[1:45:28] <+CantiCage> i did not know this was going on because i was streaming looking forward to the VOD i love this game
[1:45:31] <%678saintglock> @mrmegajackpots yesu
[1:45:34] <leith_aziz> Another issue with DBFZ Autocombo is the Autotracking
[1:45:42] <DrkJP520> The main theme in this game is killer
[1:45:46] <Heefnoff> Yeah, the autocorrect I dislike too
[1:45:51] <dds333a> Time for some dives
[1:45:57] <leith_aziz> I've not seen Igor in a while
[1:46:01] <Heefnoff> I kinda dropped DBFZ a little bit, I mostly play Marvel 3 now
[1:46:08] <0cash> arent there specific character missions that teach the special moves?
[1:46:09] <FunnyCrimes> i mean theres some cool stuff you can do with the autotracking
[1:46:13] <+SmeeblesVro> You guys are doing an excellent job teaching :)
[1:46:17] <0cash> Or is that not a thing in this game?
[1:46:30] <DrkJP520> do combo
[1:46:31] <leith_aziz> ahhhhh, this song........
[1:46:32] <Jontman42> everything required for go in do combo
[1:46:33] <Heefnoff> Oh for sure @FunnyCrimes I just don't personally like how it affects neutral
[1:46:34] <leith_aziz> The memories
[1:46:36] <dds333a> blocking sure won't always be effective here
[1:46:38] <FunnyCrimes> i think honestly dbfz has one of the best implementations of autocombos bc they actually serve functional purpose at all levels
[1:47:02] <leith_aziz> @FunnyCrimes I think thas a good thing, but its more the way its good that bother me
[1:47:05] <Heefnoff> I do love how it changes air combos @FunnyCrimes for sure
[1:47:19] <FunnyCrimes> @Heefnoff base vegeta loops are so fun lol
[1:47:20] <+KgKid51> why haven't they ported this game NotLikeThis
[1:47:20] <+SmeeblesVro> @0cash yep character trials are in this game
[1:47:23] <Heefnoff> It's good that it has a purpose because it gives beginners a tool that's actually useful
[1:47:23] <@Menitta> yeah DBFZ had a really goof implementation since there were multiple autocombos you could do
[1:47:26] <+StrawberryPantsu> Man this game needs an official or UN-official PC release
[1:47:35] <Heefnoff> That's the main reason I like the autocombos lol @FunnyCrimes
[1:47:36] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:47:50] <Heefnoff> But yeah, I just wish they changed how autocombos work in neutral. That's just me though
[1:47:50] <+SmeeblesVro> I mean it’s on their radar cause Sega released a survey and asked what the fans would like
[1:47:51] <+loukemia83> 2 fast 2 human
[1:47:53] <$SirGO0SE> LUL LUL
[1:47:56] <Heefnoff> In combos, I like them
[1:48:09] <+SmeeblesVro> And p4au was an option on the list of games that people played or heard soooo hggShaq
[1:48:15] <FunnyCrimes> u know what game shouldnt have autocombos tho? KoF
[1:48:16] <leith_aziz> My idea is that you shouldnt have tools that help in the begginner stage only and then become useless, as they just confuse the casuals
[1:48:23] <dds333a> follow ups
[1:48:37] <600greenknight> @FunnyCrimes but nobody use SSJ Vegeta auto combo
[1:48:40] <+badjab326> Whoa, Reggie looks different
[1:48:43] <0cash> @SmeeblesVro Thanks! they'd be useful here but i guess they to try different stuff too
[1:48:45] <+StrawberryPantsu> Punch Mom goin ham on the stick
[1:48:50] <Applecannon63> All outs are dust attacks
[1:49:02] <Heefnoff> @leith_aziz That's true
[1:49:11] <leith_aziz> Im still hoping for a P5A with rollback later down the road. But let them focus on Strive for now
[1:49:31] <leith_aziz> Its a game im gonna play for some time at least
[1:49:33] <Heefnoff> The problem is, auto combos just become obsolete at high level play, unless they're strong in other ways
[1:49:36] <0cash> i just want to main futaba in a fighting game. Man...
[1:49:47] <dds333a> Imagine being able to do a solo AOA in base P4
[1:49:51] <+Jiggisnipe> gonna have to beg Atlus to license Persona again
[1:49:54] <Heefnoff> Like, autocorrecting, or continuing on whiff
[1:50:12] <Heefnoff> They still have the license don't they? Cause of BBTAG? @dds333a
[1:50:17] <Heefnoff> Ah I meant @Jiggisnipe
[1:50:20] <+fetrigon> woolieSHOOK ooooo
[1:50:22] <%CaptainPileDriver> kanji does have a jumping command grab
[1:50:26] <+fetrigon> this is new
[1:50:28] <hunterstuff> @Heefnoff tbf, in this one, the autocombos are also unique attacks i think
[1:50:35] <dds333a> Yeah, Kanji has the slam dunk
[1:50:37] <leith_aziz> @Heefnoff They're still good at high level depending who. UI Goku's auto extends combos, and T.Gohan leads to mixups and is a stupid anti air.
[1:50:38] <Heefnoff> Yeah, I'm a fan of that @hunterstuff
[1:50:41] <+Jiggisnipe> @Heefnoff probably for BBTAG specifically
[1:50:56] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> but Kanji is a grabber, it's his shtick (it doesn't count for general purpose)
[1:50:56] <dds333a> anti air Body slam too
[1:50:58] <+fetrigon> wait reggie is here too woolieGASM
[1:50:58] <@Menitta> At some point it might be good to have a match to test what has been learned. That's prolly later tho
[1:50:58] <Heefnoff> DBFZ's light autocombos have unique moves too
[1:51:15] <Heefnoff> @Jiggisnipe Probably, but remember they also got the RWBY license, and now they're making a RWBY game
[1:51:17] <dds333a> But yeah, it's just Kanji's
[1:51:27] <Heefnoff> I haven't given up on that lol
[1:51:32] <schitzie> so its Dust
[1:51:37] <+hod_fareview> It's basically dust
[1:51:46] <+hod_fareview> Pre XX dust to be exact
[1:52:10] <leith_aziz> SLOWPOKE
[1:52:13] <TimetodiveLTX> that makes sense (no it doesn't)
[1:52:20] <DaKnightWarrior> Kof style
[1:52:32] <stormhawk9891> Just say it's a dodge
[1:52:44] <Applecannon63> CANT GET ME
[1:52:53] <xpakeo> punchmom watching an actual match could probably help her understand certain mechanics
[1:53:02] <xpakeo> but it might be overwhelming idk
[1:53:05] <dds333a> Jojoban has it too, which is an apt comparison, although they work differently
[1:53:28] <mar_krow> ooo
[1:53:55] <leith_aziz> I think learning defense is also very important for a beginner
[1:54:07] <leith_aziz> So maybe mention that to her
[1:54:18] <+breakersnap> if you wanna what?

[2:04:20] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> @leith_aziz Quiet, I don't have Strikers yet.
[2:04:20] <@Menitta> @SmeeblesVro where can I find it
[2:04:21] <+DarkNerdShawny> Cait sith wasn't as annoying because we couldn't hear his voice. but the man literally interrupt an important part of the game where Cloud was giving Sephiroth the black materia and wanted to come and interrupt and be like HI IM THE NEW CAIT SITH like go away!!!

[2:05:02] <+beanieboi420> Just came back, is Punch Mom playing online? Either way GO PUNCH MOM!
[2:05:05] <dds333a> Corner tech
[2:05:09] <%gatorafan> Downloading! woolieSHOOK
[2:05:09] <@Menitta> I love Morgana.
[2:05:12] <+b_aleph> @CaptainPileDriver Morgana was insecure because he was being replaced by futaba okkkk?
[2:05:13] <@Menitta> He;s great
[2:05:23] <leith_aziz> @CaptainPileDriver: Morgana has a pointless argument, but other than that he's pretty well rounded
[2:05:25] <+Grim1952> @Story_Ark Teddies character arc is better but i still like morgana better
[2:05:26] <DaKnightWarrior> That was good.
[2:05:31] <+OblivionSword1> @beanieboi420 she's against the ai right now
[2:05:31] <+trackles_64> there was a person inside?
[2:05:32] <Equirah> @Story_Ark both are not great characters LUL
[2:05:32] <%freystreams> POGGERS
[2:05:33] <Heefnoff> Nice job!
[2:05:34] <+b_aleph> @Menitta based
[2:05:34] <dds333a> And the shadow ted arm
[2:05:35] <%cobalt_phoenix_> still good!
[2:05:37] <xpakeo> RUN IT BACK!!
[2:05:39] <Heefnoff> Honestly very good start!
[2:05:41] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> Picking Kanji to learn this game isn't the best idea if you ask me, it's easier to start with Yu or Yosuke.
[2:05:42] <xpakeo> too intense
[2:05:46] <leith_aziz> But if we talking character arc, Teddie had a better arc
[2:05:46] <+Joysta> eww stay in there
[2:05:46] <+beanieboi420> @oblivionsword1 Thank you
[2:05:47] <dds333a> She even used the AOA,too, hype
[2:05:53] <Thunderhog> It takes some newbies years to learn how to block
[2:05:55] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> Or chie
[2:05:58] <TigerClaws12> nah dump the chris hu paragraph Kappa
[2:06:00] <@Menitta> I like Morgana's dialogue and contribution to conversations. I can't say the same about Teddy.
[2:06:01] <%DrJamesWoods> Punch Mom is starting to evolve. She will become a top player soon
[2:06:02] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> ...or Mitsuru.
[2:06:05] <Darren716> I feel I'd like teddie better if he wasn't the navigator for so long
[2:06:07] <%Sparkseid> making progress
[2:06:16] <dds333a> @tigerclaws12 LUL
[2:06:19] <Darren716> His voice is just annoying for going through dungeons
[2:06:20] <+loukemia83> Punch Mom vs Daigo Evo 2022
[2:06:24] <+millionstabz> Are they playing on RPCS3?
[2:06:31] <+Jiggisnipe> naw
[2:06:33] <Darren716> Nah real PS3
[2:06:36] <+b_aleph> I like that part when Morgana rats on Ryuji to Ann and Mkoto LUL
[2:06:39] <dds333a> First W and first L
[2:06:43] <%DrJamesWoods> @loukemia83 She gonna avenge Woolie
[2:06:50] <+Story_Ark> teddie at least likes yosuke, morgana's hatred of ryuji is obnoxious
[2:07:00] <+SmeeblesVro> @menitta there should be a discord link on the subreddit or a few YouTube videos include it
[2:07:08] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> Yup, the two bickering dipshits ruined Haru's introduction.
[2:07:20] <+natedrago> does parsec and rpcs3 works together?
[2:07:24] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> Gotta stay a whole fucking week not doing jackshit in the game.
[2:07:32] <+Roasted_Pheasant> FUCK YEAH ULTIMAX!
[2:07:32] <leith_aziz> @Story_Ark: Well its more like bickering. In the end, im sure Morgana respects him
[2:07:41] <%gatorafan> Become Human
[2:07:56] <+CutieZirconia> im 50 hours into golden and teddie is a menace i cannot stand him
[2:08:03] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> Hopefully P6 will have a Monkey as it's mascot so we can make Return to Monke jokes.
[2:08:39] <0cash> Hawaii + Haru's introduction are the worst parts of P5, but i dont think it ruins mona's character
[2:08:50] <dds333a> RESET
[2:08:50] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1376753284791296000
[2:09:00] <leith_aziz> We all have to start somewhere
[2:09:05] <DaKnightWarrior> good step forward.
[2:09:06] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> @0cash Haru doesn't ruin Mona's character, but Mona ruins Haru's character.
[2:09:18] <%freystreams> tbh, im tired of atlus milking p5 to the max. Please just focus on smtv and i be happy
[2:09:21] <leith_aziz> All of us play kinda bad at the start
[2:09:28] <NotHereToStream> smtv never coming out
[2:09:31] <+b_aleph> @Sonny_FIRESTORM nah, Mona helps her take the treasure!
[2:09:39] <0cash> @Sonny_FIRESTORM i dont think haru is ruined in anyway at all
[2:09:47] <leith_aziz> @FreyRune Dude, do you not know how Atlus works ? Do you not know of P4 ?
[2:09:51] <@Menitta> Can you save replays of CPU matches

[2:16:47] <%678saintglock> there’s exclamations on either side of her name now. !punch mom! approaches

[2:17:21] <DaKnightWarrior> indeed.
[2:17:22] <Heefnoff> THE SECRET MOVES
[2:17:29] <%gatorafan> THE SECRET SCROLLS monkaS
[2:17:33] <DrkJP520> the move list is a meme when you think about it
[2:17:35] <dds333a> Yup, and at arcades they would pull shit on you
[2:17:36] <leith_aziz> I think I still prefer how Strive does its movelist. actually EXPLAIN its uses and help
[2:17:39] <iacus_> @678saintglock ¡punch mom!
[2:17:46] <%cobalt_phoenix_> WHAT
[2:17:46] <+CookieCutter007> DISCORD TECH

[2:18:10] <+SmeeblesVro> Watching this unfold is sooo beautiful
[2:18:12] <%678saintglock> the formation of thuggery
[2:18:13] <Applecannon63> SELL SECRET TECHS!?
[2:18:14] <%Namillus> Oh man "pay for training" huh?
[2:18:17] <T_Sasquatch> i wonder if fighting games would be as popular if arcades never existed and it went straight to consoles
[2:18:23] <primaryfire> complex inputs
[2:18:32] <Heefnoff> I love Kanji's move names
[2:18:36] <leith_aziz> @T_Sasquatch Arcades made it more popular I think
[2:18:40] <Heefnoff> "Ass Whoopin', Tatsumi-Style"
[2:18:42] <TigerClaws12> wait punchmom using the stick of the controller?
[2:18:49] <+Jiggisnipe> stick
[2:18:51] <leith_aziz> There was buzzword cause of it
[2:18:54] <%Namillus> 236+A/B
[2:18:56] <dds333a> Here we go, i predict she'll be using this a lot
[2:18:56] <TigerClaws12> oh, stick stick
[2:19:12] <%678saintglock> and now we got mainmanswe selling training at $75 for 2hrs
[2:19:27] <dds333a> there it is
[2:19:34] <%678saintglock> coaching* rather
[2:19:51] <Heefnoff> SHE'S DOING IT ON BOTH SIDES
[2:19:52] <Applecannon63> The Guillotine Chair
[2:19:56] <leith_aziz> @678saintglock: Yeah, I've finded the price to bee pretty high. Didnt Leffen do the same ?
[2:20:00] <+b_aleph> What's happenin? TK?
[2:20:06] <%freystreams> @T_Sasquatch i don't think it would have been popular if it went straight to console, fighting games took off from the local 1v1 scene. playing against someone locally is not the same feeling compared to playing at home
[2:20:12] <kevamadi> @T_Sasquatch Well, Smash Bros got big, but that's an EXTREMELY special case...
[2:20:19] <Jontman42> here seeing the button inputs would be helpful
[2:20:25] <Applecannon63> GIANT GUILLOTINE
[2:20:26] <wujak> maybe turn inputs back on so she can see what she is actually inputting
[2:20:26] <+loukemia83> stick is going to far up, need to end find that forward
[2:20:28] <%678saintglock> @leith_aziz not sure but it sounds believable
[2:20:29] <primaryfire> good advice reggie
[2:20:30] <Heefnoff> Yeah Woolz turn inputs on
[2:20:46] <Tracazoid> She's getting it
[2:20:47] <Heefnoff> Never mind, she got it
[2:20:49] <Heefnoff> Holy shit
[2:20:51] <T_Sasquatch> imagine .... a world without fighting games ... its beautiful Kappa
[2:20:55] <PanicSwytch> She's beginning to believe
[2:21:26] <xpakeo> framedata time
[2:21:28] <%678saintglock> man that was such a perfect question
[2:21:29] <dds333a> A whole lot of reasons, but that's for later I feel
[2:21:37] <%Mrbaconator> SHE'S CRACKING THE CODE
[2:21:37] <dds333a> But yeah
[2:21:38] <%Zero_Jacks> the back of my mind wants to see The Grab combo
[2:21:43] <Thunderhog> Or weak ones might be easier to put into combos where heavy ones take too much time
[2:21:44] <Applecannon63> Strong is useful as a ender
[2:21:57] <T_Sasquatch> i want them to slowly build up her confidence then toss her into online and watch her get cutscene'd LUL
[2:22:11] <+RealPT1> It's like why you don't do strong physical moves in the RPG. You don't want to keep using your HP for big attacks
[2:22:19] <leith_aziz> @678saintglock: Well I dont know. I kinda avoid Mainman now since I've stopped playing Tekken and I find his humor really try hardy. He was also aacting like a dick all around when he tried Strive (its fine if he doesnt like it. Its more how he was reacting to everything when its not whats he's used to)
[2:22:23] <+Parrish_broadnax> get into fighting games crash course
[2:22:27] <+beanieboi420> I wish I could be as good at teaching as Woolie and Reggie are. Still hard teaching my little cousin about jump B in Smash. Loving this session man
[2:22:33] <+SmeeblesVro> I mean she said she sees the mountain and wants to get there so she got tough skin
[2:22:39] <dds333a> QcbF down pat
[2:22:47] <%678saintglock> that’s like THE newbie question “why would i ever use this move when there’s a higher damage version”, imo once you start asking that question you’re in
[2:22:53] <Applecannon63> GIANT GUILLOTINE
[2:22:58] <dds333a> what the fuck, I mean Qcf

[2:22:58] <leith_aziz> I played aganist some newcomers in GG Xrd Rev 2. Felt great helping them get better
[2:22:59] <Heefnoff> @678saintglock Absolutely
[2:23:14] <%CutieZirconia> CutieZirconia subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[2:23:21] <Heefnoff> SHE'S GAMING
[2:23:24] <FacetiousAF> BODY HIM
[2:23:27] <+Grayhammatter> yeyeye, she's gaming
[2:23:28] <+beanieboi420> All of this that y'all are saying is true
[2:23:35] <sapphomet777> fightin games baybee
[2:23:35] <dds333a> Good stuff
[2:23:44] <+beanieboi420> She big time fite gaming
[2:23:51] <NotHereToStream> you know she's in when she's labbing
[2:24:25] <dds333a> You can put the input on screen can't you?
[2:24:39] <leith_aziz> Strive's info on moves is the best in my opinion since it actually show you the move ALONGSIDE the text, making it convinient
[2:24:40] <+sparki90> Take him out!
[2:25:15] <leith_aziz> (I mean with footage)
[2:25:22] <Heefnoff> LETS FUCKING GO
[2:25:25] <%Mrbaconator> YEEEEEE
[2:25:27] <Saltmeisterr> aye
[2:25:30] <leith_aziz> It takes some use
[2:25:30] <+beanieboi420> Even I have trouble with this stuff man
[2:25:33] <+SmeeblesVro> We learning rekkas now hggGolazo
[2:25:33] <+Jiggisnipe> :)
[2:25:34] <dds333a> The mechanic known as "buffering"
[2:25:40] <xpakeo> she kinda crazy at this game PogChamp
[2:25:40] <+loukemia83> Thats a second combo!
[2:25:51] <+Deko_> this is really satisfying to watch LUL
[2:25:52] <FacetiousAF> Bread n Butter?
[2:26:05] <+beanieboi420> Oh very
[2:26:09] <+Jiggisnipe> watching someone learn something new is great
[2:26:14] <DaKnightWarrior> They don't call her Punchmom for nothing.
[2:26:26] <xpakeo> Combomom
[2:26:28] <dds333a> You plan it out, yeah
[2:26:35] <+Story_Ark> when is punchmom entering her first tourney?
[2:27:23] <+beanieboi420> Just learning combos in general are tricky for me, even while playing Fite Games "Seriously" since SFV
[2:27:46] <Afrosamasenpai> punchmom do combo
[2:27:50] <+TheGenerousDon> woolieSMUG
[2:27:50] <Heefnoff> @beanieboi420 What in particular do you have trouble with?
[2:27:50] <dds333a> You can buffer this too somewhat
[2:28:03] <+beanieboi420> @story_ark Exactly, that will be hype
[2:28:05] <%Buttface_> COMMAND GRAB
[2:28:07] <leith_aziz> I will say, learning combos in SFV was th hardest for me. Combos in Guilty Gear and Tekken were easier form e
[2:28:09] <leith_aziz> *me
[2:28:15] <dds333a> QCB time
[2:28:21] <RyanGelatin> just got here are we only doing this because ps3 go byebye
[2:28:35] <+b_aleph> @leith_aziz SF use links instead of cancels, that's why
[2:28:42] <dds333a> @ryangelatin to get Punchmom into fitegames
[2:28:43] <FrostedZaibatsu> grapplers...
[2:28:48] <Applecannon63> Command throw goodness
[2:28:50] <+beanieboi420> @heefnoff Buffering and connecting moves together is tricky. Learning what connects info what is tricky too
[2:29:01] <%DrJamesWoods> we need a screen for tiny reggie
[2:29:05] <Applecannon63> Unga bunga Grappler~
[2:29:07] <+Jiggisnipe> @RyanGelatin get her into fighting games and she's familiar with Persona
[2:29:09] <OldManDeckardCain> the pat special LUL
[2:29:10] <@Solidus_113> GRAP
[2:29:11] <PanicSwytch> I love seeing the face of joy when Punchmom does correct inputs
[2:29:13] <RyanGelatin> FUCK yea
[2:29:14] <RyanGelatin> sick
[2:29:26] <T_Sasquatch> Perfect, drop your shield !
[2:29:27] <$SirGO0SE> She LOVES it
[2:29:28] <Heefnoff> WHY DOES IT DO 33%
[2:29:29] <Applecannon63> STABBEM
[2:29:29] <Dr_Mooose> LUL
[2:29:29] <RyanGelatin> punch mom becomes even PUNCHIER
[2:29:31] <Heefnoff> LOOOOOL
[2:29:32] <+beanieboi420> @leith_aziz Sameish
[2:29:33] <dds333a> They might be doing so because of the whole thing, but this is primarily to get a complete newbie into fitegames, and this game isn't bad for beginners either
[2:29:33] <FacetiousAF> drop your table
[2:29:38] <+b_aleph> @DrJamesWoods He could be in the shield's place
[2:29:38] <+beanieboi420> DAYUM
[2:29:43] <BlackermanZX> thats a scary command grab
[2:29:51] <dds333a> Oh yeah, follow up
[2:29:55] <Heefnoff> IT HAS INVUL?
[2:29:59] <NotHereToStream> armor monkaS
[2:30:00] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:30:05] <dds333a> That too
[2:30:10] <leith_aziz> THATS why I love S Broly in DBFZ. Straight up DP super, which you can cancel into another character
[2:30:11] <Heefnoff> Can you not grab there?
[2:30:16] <Heefnoff> Like, normal grab that?
[2:30:20] <dds333a> Nope
[2:30:26] <Heefnoff> LOOOOOL damn
[2:30:32] <dds333a> I don't think so, anyway
[2:30:33] <%678saintglock> yeah plus if i’m not mistaken punch mom is a persona fan right? seems like the most appealing start for her
[2:30:34] <+SmeeblesVro> @leith_aziz I just wish he had better frame data but I agree he’s a blast to play
[2:30:40] <%DrJamesWoods> @DrJamesWoods I think tiny reggie should be where the heart is
[2:30:51] <Heefnoff> I really like his other grab

[2:30:56] <+loukemia83> Tiny reggie should be where the fist is clearly
[2:31:03] <+Jiggisnipe> going from forward to back is always tough
[2:31:03] <Jontman42> seeing inputs would help
[2:31:08] <leith_aziz> @SmeeblesVro: I think he needs faster grabs. Z Broly's are much faster AND safer
[2:31:30] <%DrJamesWoods> The heart to symbolize his place in the hearts of the fans
[2:31:55] <+SmeeblesVro> @leith_aziz yeah fr I hate z bully c805Peepthis
[2:32:14] <+Story_Ark> Yu jump?
[2:32:53] <dds333a> Qcb, down pat
[2:33:59] <leith_aziz> @SmeeblesVro: You know what made me hate Z Broly ? He was left last in the team. I knocked him down, tried to pressure, he did the armored charge, cancelled into Level 3, did 80%. Dumbest shit I've seen. Made me lose many matches
[2:34:19] <dds333a> The input is the same with the person button, but it's si
[2:34:28] <dds333a> *situational
[2:34:53] <+SmeeblesVro> @leith_aziz yeah his damage as anchor is bs and I’ve lost soooo many matches. I stopped playing ranked for a while cause it was just broly or Ui every match lol
[2:35:08] <deafmelone> My favorite move lol
[2:35:13] <Heefnoff> Is it air only?
[2:35:18] <FunnyCrimes> air only
[2:35:19] <stormhawk9891> Air only
[2:35:19] <%Buttface_> THE FLYING SHITLORD
[2:35:20] <Jontman42> thought it said mid-air only
[2:35:26] <twoto858> In mid air only?
[2:35:27] <BUDderzIllA> WANT SUM?
[2:35:28] <dds333a> In mid-air
[2:35:30] <Applecannon63> the anti air is like a way to situational ver of Air Knee Smash
[2:35:35] <deafmelone> Mid air only
[2:36:00] <+gpallas> Can't you put inputs on screen to know what's going wrong with each try to do an input?
[2:36:14] <Heefnoff> You can do Cruel Attack after
[2:36:17] <dds333a> Yeah, there it is
[2:36:20] <+gpallas> Or would it kinda overwhelm her?
[2:36:32] <dds333a> It's the basic qcb, just in mid-air
[2:36:34] <+SmeeblesVro> Yeah activate the show input settings I feel like that would be pretty helpful
[2:36:37] <mothdude> I think you can do Cruel attack after all the grabs.
[2:36:40] <+Roasted_Pheasant> The ex version does more hits
[2:36:47] <leith_aziz> @SmeeblesVro: Right now its been SS4 Gogeta in every DAMN team. I was in Living Legend and got deranked from it 5 times in a row. Im stuck in SS Blue rank and thinking of stopping with DBFZ in general. Im using UI in the team now and its made things much smoother, but I think im gonna call it quits
[2:36:48] <dds333a> @mothdude sure can
[2:36:51] <Heefnoff> @SmeeblesVro Pretty sure Woolz is player 1 so it'd only show his inputs
[2:36:55] <josemoya95> Chair lounge after I believe
[2:36:56] <+Roasted_Pheasant> Ex Version does the most hits and tracks
[2:37:03] <+Story_Ark> the ex version is the best
[2:37:03] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1376753284791296000
[2:37:24] <+SmeeblesVro> @heefnoff ah I thought it would show hers as well mb
[2:37:26] <dds333a> @roasted_pheasant and the fact that it tracks like a motherfucker is amazing
[2:37:38] <dds333a> Kanji flies with the EX version
[2:37:59] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> I'm having such a good time watching this lol. too bad I have to split my attention on cooking.
[2:38:26] <+nemtehe> @Meta_Yoroitoshi watcha cooking
[2:38:40] <dds333a> @meta_yoroitoshi I'm about to start cooking too, funny
[2:39:11] <xpakeo> she learned motions so much faster than i did
[2:39:32] <dds333a> They're usually pretty universal here
[2:39:35] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> I'm making ground beef to go with these lasagna rollers lol. gotta get the sauce ready soon too.
[2:39:37] <dds333a> kinda
[2:39:40] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Unless it's a charge character!
[2:40:00] <Krimxon> Can't wait til Punch Mom 2-0s Woolie at Evo
[2:40:05] <@Solidus_113> fundies
[2:40:07] <dds333a> In mechanics, they vary vastly
[2:40:09] <xpakeo> run away from charge characters
[2:40:10] <%ekodrop> whispering in your ears
[2:40:10] <+nemtehe> @Meta_Yoroitoshi daaamn man that sounds good, save some for me.
[2:40:15] <dds333a> yeah, Reg beat me to it
[2:40:26] <+sparki90> @Meta_Yoroitoshi There better be enough for the class!
[2:40:38] <dds333a> Now the charge
[2:40:41] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> I'll try @nemtehe lmao!
[2:40:42] <$SirGO0SE> the Kirby Headphones look a lot better on Steph than on Woolie ;)
[2:40:51] <Afrosamasenpai> ABC. Always. Be. Charging.
[2:41:15] <dds333a> Damn. nice
[2:41:31] <@Solidus_113> YOOOOOO
[2:41:34] <@Solidus_113> FIRST TRY
[2:41:39] <dds333a> This still trips people up because no game can decide on the damn timing
[2:42:02] <%Buttface_> this game has multiple timings for charge moves
[2:42:17] <%Buttface_> pretty sure droit is a different timing from primal force
[2:42:18] <xpakeo> it took me a week to do charge moves semi consistently in sf4
[2:42:18] <+Jiggisnipe> PogChamp
[2:42:19] <+bapposbungers> Is that Punchmom?
[2:42:19] <+Parrish_broadnax> look at her, with the tech\
[2:42:20] <%Namillus> Yeah great observation
[2:42:21] <+Jiggisnipe> look at her
[2:42:28] <+bapposbungers> Holy shit, that's rad!
[2:42:33] <+kastev> Hey chat, does anyone know when the next Yakuza Dragon stream will be?
[2:42:39] <dds333a> @buttface_ LUL, exactly, this very game has different timing from Mitsuru to others
[2:42:51] <@Solidus_113> keep that zio meaty
[2:43:06] <Applecannon63> ZIO STRAT
[2:43:09] <%druupy_> Probably not for a while @kastev
[2:43:10] <+Jiggisnipe> @kastev if you mean Like a Dragon, who knows. They are returning to 0 whenever V comes back
[2:43:13] <dds333a> Them invalid combos
[2:43:14] <xpakeo> @kastev no more dragon stream for a long time
[2:43:18] <+kastev> D:
[2:43:22] <+kastev> Oh no, what happened?
[2:43:23] <+bapposbungers> @kastev It's done, there will be no more Like a Dragon streams most  likely until he finishes 0
[2:43:35] <+kastev> Oh, he wants to finish 0 first?

[3:11:22] <%678saintglock> akihiko woolieGASM
[3:11:31] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> In the first Arena, everyone had 4 Card Gauges. That was a mistake as some characters rely on Persona far more than others.
[3:11:47] <point4effort> Can you play as nanako in this?
[3:11:51] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> Now characters can have 3 or even 5 card gauges.
[3:12:05] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> More cards takes longer to break, but also longer to reload.
