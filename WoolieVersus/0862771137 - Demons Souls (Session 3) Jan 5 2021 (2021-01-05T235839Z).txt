[0:02:59] <%ekodrop> ekodrop subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months! Reggie seems to be haunted by the soul of a COW. It's afflicting him with great panic, excessive consumption of limited resources and an uncontrolable desire to roll. Think it's time for him to put on that ring of courage to help WARD off that COW.
[0:03:02] <andre11dr> Man the government just loves telling you what to do doesn't it

[0:03:36] <%wydamn> @lion_kun, maybe indirectly, Canada has it's share of anti-maskers and covid-deniers. Plus smaller population means you have to try harder to keep numbers low.

[0:17:45] <velgaduere> Reggie wants to fightgame this and I respect the shit outta that
[0:17:51] <ronin19xx> I mean he is a fighting game person
[0:17:54] <%ekodrop> so Reggie vs Nioh is next
[0:18:04] <ronin19xx> Ay Spy
[0:18:06] <taquito_blade> souls is git gud incarnate
[0:18:12] <brunoberserk> german spy , scholar of boletaria
[0:18:23] <andre11dr> A lot of the lore i just looking at the environment in this game
[0:18:34] <Silenos> Yes, some enemies has delayed attacks
[0:18:36] <ronin19xx> Learn those animations, its key
[0:18:38] <SirDonko> Combat is pretty good. Do you know what I mean?
[0:18:45] <%krispen_wa> Counter hits are some strong shit
[0:18:46] <%Valask> wait really
[0:18:49] <+0neReeler> counterhit
[0:18:53] <velgaduere> counterhit on evasion FeelsCrustyMan
[0:18:53] <%Valask> I had no idea
[0:19:12] <%emperordread> Essence of Counter
[0:19:13] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:19:21] <penitentpendant> "Counter!"
[0:19:21] <Blank9> dashing also causes counterhit damage
[0:19:24] <taquito_blade> good to know
[0:19:25] <%Javaa01> All the Souls games have a counter hit system in play
[0:19:25] <andre11dr> So they did have counters back in DeS
[0:19:26] <+jiggy_snipe> DeS was a fighting game all along Kappa
[0:19:26] <%krispen_wa> TIGER DROP
[0:19:27] <Silenos> during an enemies attack you get dammage bonus yes
[0:19:30] <andre11dr> I was right
[0:19:36] <Blank9> so if you're sprinting from enemies you take more damage for being hit during it
[0:19:39] <ronin19xx> Ying to the yang
[0:19:40] <cosmicgoatee> German Spy be like: ROYAL GAURD
[0:19:41] <%Javaa01> In recovery frames, you are in a counter hit state
[0:19:45] <taquito_blade> oof
[0:19:53] <+0neReeler> guardbreak
[0:19:54] <%blastyoboots> this is why you BLOCK THEIR HITS
[0:19:54] <velgaduere> EVERY ACTION MATTERS monkaS
[0:19:58] <taquito_blade> this is life death detail
[0:20:06] <Prevot> poise boise
[0:20:11] <andre11dr> I knew they were here because there actually a ring dedicated to counterhits in this game
[0:20:20] <%blastyoboots> that's why regular block with the dang shield is worth doing!!!
[0:20:31] <ronin19xx> Oooo the spear would be nice for 1-2
[0:20:50] <ronin19xx> Nice
[0:20:51] <+Genericmistake> @taquito_blade i beat this game 3 times before i found out about counter hits LUL It was not until DS2 that i found out about the system
[0:20:52] <%Seancicle> ‚ÜòÔ∏èHA‚ÜóÔ∏èHA‚ÜóÔ∏èHA‚ÜôÔ∏èHA
[0:20:55] <Silenos> So the moves is also related to how much running you do
[0:20:56] <ronin19xx> Good one Reg
[0:21:00] <@Solidus_113> peko
[0:21:01] <Silenos> or rolls
[0:21:02] <$Chumblago13> Pekora
[0:21:06] <DukeBlack_> I never looked at it like that
[0:21:07] <velgaduere> I think you might have 2 R2 + 2 rolls
[0:21:13] <%Valask> you're realistically gonna panic and mash often, and you're not gonna be max stamina all the time
[0:21:18] <penitentpendant> Warm up while farming grass in 1-1, 1-2?
[0:21:18] <DukeBlack_> we learning!!
[0:21:20] <+0neReeler> 5attacks unless vs poisebeast
[0:21:23] <%krispen_wa> BROKEN ONE
[0:21:26] <taquito_blade> @genericmistake today i learned lol
[0:21:28] <ronin19xx> Hyper gamify the game
[0:21:33] <%hax_metatron> Frankly you can learn to look at the stamina bar and leave some leftover for a roll. Calculating "how many moves" you have per stamina is nice and all, but you won't always start attacking with the full stamina bar

[0:27:19] <%ekodrop> parrying these weebs is crazy easy
[0:27:19] <DXLelouch24> Reggie is VERY underleveled for this area
[0:27:20] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> gotta get closer!
[0:27:21] <ronin19xx> Stellar actually

[0:27:37] <RyuuAoi> Beautiful. AND STRONG DEFENSE.
[0:27:38] <Solidnick18> why not
[0:27:40] <+liquidzr0> why is he here? 2-1 is more appropriate for his level
[0:27:42] <Pookiedaexzile> Two hands baby

[0:28:00] <%Indigo_Automaton> I just got here, did Reggie just start?
[0:28:01] <andre11dr> So some facts about these guys, they are so weak to blunt damage that his fists would do more damage here
[0:28:01] <ronin19xx> @liquidzr0 Uchi
[0:28:03] <+killgannon_beats> For ps5
[0:28:08] <%Lion_kun> Woolie, you're gonna destroy Reggie's confidence
[0:28:13] <DXLelouch24> Until its not and the game tells you to go fuck yourself
[0:28:18] <%BlueJoneleth> Tip : go to 5-1, pick the mace right at the start and come back here XD
[0:28:19] <@Solidus_113> this is how you play dex
[0:28:20] <+brightman42> should've grinded out some grass off stream
[0:28:21] <RyuuAoi> Defense is just as important as offense, Reggie. You're either shielding a lot of rolling a lot. Pick your poison.
[0:28:24] <%Terrarp> I think he's a few levels under for this area
[0:28:25] <+liquidzr0> @ronin19xx ah
[0:28:32] <Silenos> we are learning
[0:28:32] <RyuuAoi> Mimic their style of play.

[0:28:45] <@Solidus_113> slash weapons also don't help with the damage type
[0:28:47] <+killgannon_beats> This looks like the old one
[0:28:48] <Pookiedaexzile> You gotta Choose Shield for Defense or Rolls for Defense
[0:28:50] <MyNameIsRasus> "oh shit is correct"
[0:28:51] <%linSP> does Reggie have a club? Bare hands are way better than any slashing damage
[0:28:53] <+jiggy_snipe> Reggie gon learn today
[0:28:58] <ronin19xx> Luring, nice
[0:29:01] <brunoberserk> need a blunt weapon

[0:31:04] <RyuuAoi> More defense
[0:31:05] <taquito_blade> get Dursted
[0:31:06] <+jiggy_snipe> so I'm curious how persistent Reggie will be

[0:31:08] <%Razputin217> BONE ZONE
[0:31:08] <ronin19xx> Hell yeah Reg
[0:31:09] <Solidnick18> wake up reggie
[0:31:12] <%Pillagius> You could say... Reggie got rolled over Kappa
[0:31:14] <%hax_metatron> God Reggie is such a natural at Souls games. I can SEEEE the improvement he's gaining
[0:31:23] <Silenos> Big attack big stamina down
[0:31:26] <velgaduere> BIG PRACTICE
[0:31:29] <ronin19xx> Clean-ish
[0:31:35] <MyNameIsRasus> You have a good shield, use it
[0:31:37] <@Solidus_113> remember, inside the asshole for backstabs
[0:31:38] <andre11dr> Again these are the "grunts" of this area LUL
[0:31:41] <RyuuAoi> TELL HIM WOOLIE. PREACH
[0:31:43] <%hax_metatron> Fuck yeah Reggie. KING SHIT
[0:31:48] <Pookiedaexzile> Best Way to use it is on your back
[0:32:00] <%linSP> PUNCH HIM REGGIE
[0:32:01] <MyNameIsRasus> THAT DODGE
[0:32:02] <+brightman42> dat dodge
[0:32:04] <%Grimlockfly> Oh yeah , parries
[0:32:04] <%Lion_kun> I would grab the blessed mace in 5-1 before attempting this zone.
[0:32:05] <taquito_blade> Reggie REALLY needs to pack on stamina
[0:32:05] <%yusefHD> That bend literally saved youi
[0:32:07] <ronin19xx> Healing items are low
[0:32:24] <Silenos> soul remains are quite usefull, but also dangerous sometimes
[0:32:26] <ronin19xx> Lureing is key here
[0:32:32] <%ChoculaUltra> holy shit
[0:32:33] <%jackelzxaa> Did woolie reccomend world 4 or did reggie pick it by luck?
[0:32:34] <@Solidus_113> crush counter
[0:32:35] <Pookiedaexzile> Its almost like blocking is useless
[0:32:35] <ronin19xx> Luring*
[0:32:36] <%ChoculaUltra> the corner combo
[0:32:37] <Solidnick18> corner is love
[0:32:38] <velgaduere> welcome to the Shrine of Hard Knocks
[0:32:41] <+chiazam> Would his fists actually be better than the falchion?
[0:32:44] <+brightman42> oh, this is the grass farming
[0:32:50] <andre11dr> I think Reggie forgot he has a parry
[0:32:51] <penitentpendant> @jackelzxaa Woolie Bean Dad'd reggie and recommended this area
[0:32:51] <%Lion_kun> Woolie recommended this area lol
[0:32:52] <ronin19xx> Environmental awareness too
[0:32:55] <%BlueJoneleth> grab your souls and level up :)
[0:32:55] <%hax_metatron> Here's my prediction. By the end Reggie will be soo good he will one shot Allant.
[0:32:55] <taquito_blade> ok for sure Reggie needs to be comfortable with partying before doin this ü§î
[0:32:59] <slix3431> Cow's souls
[0:32:59] <RyuuAoi> Down to that last bit of stamina and the enemy ain't dead? ROLL OUT. No greed.
[0:32:59] <%jackelzxaa> Yeah damage types are super real in demons souls
[0:33:03] <%TrafficCohen> Bean Woolie
[0:33:05] <cosmicgoatee> the back down LUL you gotta parry Reggie
[0:33:06] <taquito_blade> parrying*

[0:33:08] <Silenos> there we go
[0:33:09] <Prevot> blocking is for losers, chads roll

[0:33:17] <Zayasu> @TrafficCohen LUL
[0:33:20] <%blastyoboots> oh he absolutely HAS to see the fist riposte against these guys.
[0:33:21] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:33:32] <%jackelzxaa> Bash moves are how you hurt skeletons for big damage, even with bare knuckles
[0:33:35] <+killgannon_beats> Oh they playin the old one. Wth. Why not the new shiny one???!!
[0:33:35] <ronin19xx> Backstabs are an option now
[0:33:36] <Pookiedaexzile> Blocking is considered poor form
[0:33:39] <velgaduere> that's a juicy amount of souls

[0:34:53] <%krispen_wa> Demon Souls Combo MAD compilation 1: Styling on Reggie
[0:34:59] <%cache_22> Will Reggie have to grind for grass again?
[0:35:00] <Pookiedaexzile> Your Shield is your enem
[0:35:01] <%TheAntitype> be aggressive, b-e agressive
[0:35:02] <Pookiedaexzile> y
[0:35:03] <LunarRemix> Does he not have a 100% physical shield?
[0:35:07] <ronin19xx> Nice

[0:35:09] <%yusefHD> Your life is pretty dope reggie
[0:35:12] <%ClericOfSparda> go back for grass
[0:35:16] <+0neReeler> touch archstone
[0:35:17] <+jiggy_snipe> Kappa
[0:35:18] <RyuuAoi> @woolieversus is Reggie greedy?
[0:35:18] <%Indigo_Automaton> "Look at my life" -Reggie
[0:35:21] <velgaduere> definitely a good idea to buy some grass rn
[0:35:22] <slix3431> "Look at my life!" -Reggarth
[0:35:22] <pi_in_the_sci> go buy grass
[0:35:23] <%linSP> this is a grassless zone
[0:35:24] <Silenos> So also theres something to consider, how much time you spend fighting an enemy is also an issue
[0:35:28] <MyNameIsRasus> Moo
[0:35:30] <%Seancicle> TwitchSings KomodoHype
[0:35:31] <+askalta> parry the roll
[0:35:33] <andre11dr> Danm i forgot how for real these dudes are for new players,especially since they are basically in every game
[0:35:34] <+Genericmistake> @WoolieVersus i don't think he knows you heal at the archstone. It resets but it lets him practice without losing meds
[0:35:34] <cosmicgoatee> only 4 skellies
[0:35:38] <sendart> yeah grass or a level would be nice
[0:35:38] <%BlueJoneleth> go leevel up
[0:35:40] <+killgannon_beats> I asked if this was the new one, no answer. I googled, says 2009
[0:35:40] <velgaduere> THIS IS THE WAY
[0:35:40] <+Jaromero435> Just keep rollin
[0:35:41] <%Lion_kun> I would farm 1-2 for grass, grab the blessdnmace
[0:35:42] <santafer> man, I want to see Reggie vs Sekiro and Bloodborne
[0:35:43] <+brightman42> he did forget parries maybe
[0:35:43] <+mauricefaurron> git gud Kappa
[0:35:43] <taquito_blade> you can parry a roll???
[0:35:44] <+chiazam> YEAH
[0:35:45] <therealtacopancakes> why no magic weapon?
[0:35:48] <$BallerSwagBro9k> GET THAT KUSH
[0:35:49] <ronin19xx> Big lessons
[0:36:00] <%Terrarp> go to 2-1
[0:36:02] <+killgannon_beats> I asked if this was the new one, no answer. I googled, says 2009 Soooo
[0:36:12] <%Lion_kun> I would farm 1-2 for grass, grab the blessd mace in 5-1 and rock these boys.
[0:36:14] <velgaduere> @killgannon_beats this is the new one, yeah
[0:36:14] <Pookiedaexzile> Drop that dead weight
[0:36:15] <%jackelzxaa> Reggie should buy the defense buff spell
[0:36:16] <dundore77> world 4 is the grinding spot
[0:36:16] <Silenos> Yea remade demon souls
[0:36:18] <ronin19xx> Spear would be optimal for 2-1
[0:36:21] <+mechslayer71> @killgannon_beats no offense, but does this look like a FromSoft game from 2009?
[0:36:23] <Pookiedaexzile> You're a natural Roll
[0:36:28] <%jackelzxaa> Defense buff spells in demons souls are good
[0:36:31] <+brightman42> maybe repair the sword too
[0:36:31] <%blastyoboots> bare handed!!! try bare handed!
[0:36:32] <+jiggy_snipe> this is the new one, they are both called Demon's Souls
[0:36:35] <+0neReeler> no heal magic yet?
[0:36:42] <+kraajkase> people just can't help themselves with the tips.. give the man a chance
[0:36:46] <cosmicgoatee> Reggies gonna drain that grass
[0:36:51] <%blastyoboots> you don't even NEED the sword against these guys try fisting
[0:36:53] <slix3431> Gaurdo Crrrrrrrruuuuush!
[0:36:56] <@Solidus_113> skeleton Focus Attack
[0:37:01] <%krispen_wa> USE PICKLE STONE
[0:37:07] <%jackelzxaa> A club will wreck them, yoo
[0:37:08] <penitentpendant> This game has a bit of the same problem Bloodborne in that you have to grind healing items. LP Time Tax, as it were.
[0:37:09] <ronin19xx> @0neReeler He dosent have enough Jesus
[0:37:11] <+brightman42> not 2k
[0:37:15] <+0neReeler> repair stone?
[0:37:23] <+mechslayer71> @killgannon_beats in case you aren‚Äôt in the know, Fromsoft games kinda looks like ass. This looks way too good to be one, especially from back then, so it‚Äôs the new one
[0:37:26] <%jackelzxaa> I think the damage mitigation on slash and stab on skeles is like 50%?
[0:37:31] <%jackelzxaa> Its real high
[0:37:35] <sonofthedeepsouth> chad falchion
[0:37:37] <+brightman42> sharpening stone isn't worth it outside of in the field emergencies
[0:37:43] <ronin19xx> Gotta say, Woolz is a nice coach

[0:38:19] <+jiggy_snipe> is Woolie gonna give a tip?
[0:38:26] <%jackelzxaa> Damage types: Stab is good on scales, slash is good on skin, strike is good on armor and bones
[0:38:29] <Silenos> hmmm maybe

[0:41:28] <brian_peppers1> parry is good only if you're good
[0:41:31] <ronin19xx> Best to parry with comfy health
[0:41:41] <+kewlmyc> Brining a falchion to this area just sucks. Not sure what Woolie's plan is.
[0:41:49] <andre11dr> Just headbutt everything lol Kappa

[0:41:50] <SilverFaustX> room
[0:41:52] <%jackelzxaa> Because of damage types i always roll with a few weapons in souls games. Pat does the ‚Äúsingle weapon playthroughs‚Äù thing but i always bring 2 or 3 weapons so i can switch for whats needed like a character action game
[0:42:04] <ronin19xx> PHEW
[0:42:08] <%yusefHD> Woolie, you gotta know Reggie's got the Shrodinger's cat thing going on. If you tell him it exists, that's it

[0:42:36] <ronin19xx> Live overleveling XD
[0:42:43] <Silenos> Parry timings differ with every enemy, and some things are unparriable
[0:42:50] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Is Reggie aware of enemy damage types weakness (blunt, pierce and slash)?
[0:42:52] <andre11dr> Man if only you could throw shit in this game
[0:42:57] <%jackelzxaa> Theres some dumb spots in world 4 where you can GRIND SOULS like churning butter
[0:42:58] <Josef_Stryker> Did Reggie decide to go to the Shrine of Storms or did Woolie suggest him to?
[0:43:08] <ronin19xx> @Josef_Stryker Woolz

[0:44:42] <sonofthedeepsouth> LOGIC? LUL
[0:44:42] <%Indigo_Automaton> A good tip for spacing, look at the ground between you and your opponent instead of estimating your attack range
[0:44:43] <+chiazam> um
[0:44:46] <peachy996> you thought
[0:44:55] <Pookiedaexzile> Does Reggie know you don't need a sheild to parry
[0:45:14] <andre11dr> I bet Woolie didn't foresee this when he told him to go to 4-1
[0:45:14] <RyuuAoi> Baby steps
[0:45:16] <velgaduere> @Pookiedaexzile nah, but he's gonna need that shield regardless
[0:45:21] <+0neReeler> only 50% damage taken
[0:45:33] <Equirah> @andre11dr he had to
[0:45:37] <Pookiedaexzile> The sheild is only holding em back

[0:46:03] <%krispen_wa> not really
[0:46:06] <Equirah> just get a 100% shield or learn when to dodge
[0:46:09] <Pookiedaexzile> Yes he is, We saw it last play thu
[0:46:13] <Pookiedaexzile> He's a rolling natural

[0:46:29] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> try that swing skelly does after rolling
[0:46:32] <+goney> someone get this poor man a blunt weapon
[0:46:32] <%SarcFa> being honest the slow swings can have weirder parry timings than the fast ones
[0:46:33] <RyuuAoi> When they swing with their right hand, roll left.
[0:46:36] <Silenos> ive seen your shine spark SwiftRage

[0:48:11] <Pookiedaexzile> How far up the tier list we wanna go
[0:48:12] <andre11dr> Big Berserk reference
[0:48:13] <RyuuAoi> Weaker than your spear
[0:48:17] <MyNameIsRasus> This game's a berserk reference
[0:48:19] <%blastyoboots> gosh i hope woolie eventually tells Reggie to equip bare fist against the skeletons. the difference is REALLY incredible
[0:48:21] <Equirah> better scalling
[0:48:24] <sonofthedeepsouth> STR>dex
[0:48:26] <%krispen_wa> Always has been
[0:48:28] <nmaten> looks like its time to reread berserk once again
[0:48:31] <OldManDeckardCain> what isn't a berserk reference in this game LUL
[0:48:33] <+Graxe_> But remember what it said in the description
[0:48:36] <+Graxe_> Shields
[0:48:39] <Silenos> So one way to access it... try the moveset and think about it... swing it a bit
[0:48:50] <+theunkownhero> nothing better than hitting people who just turtle behind shields with that bad boy
[0:48:55] <blink289> Woah I received enough points to highlight my message!
[0:48:56] <MyNameIsRasus> make those skeletons bleed
[0:48:59] <RyuuAoi> Couple hits in there
[0:49:04] <Pookiedaexzile> Same Move set?
[0:49:12] <velgaduere> @nmaten all it really takes is someone bringing it up. I'm backlogged on Berserk rereads for literal years. help FeelsBadMan
[0:49:27] <velgaduere> I wanna do something else FeelsBadMan
[0:49:34] <%Seancicle> I wouldn't see Woolie again till college
[0:49:38] <@Solidus_113> speen
[0:49:46] <%Seancicle> OSFrog
[0:49:50] <brunoberserk> shotel , the weapon of the hero lautrec LUL
[0:49:51] <LunarRemix> It looks faster than the Scimitar
[0:49:56] <ronin19xx> Its all in the mvesret
[0:49:59] <slix3431> Reggarth the Doth Rakki
[0:50:00] <+0neReeler> fancy finisher
[0:50:01] <nmaten> there is no escape from berserk
[0:50:01] <Silenos> There's also range to think about
[0:50:04] <andre11dr> DeS is actually a little more subtle with the Berserk reference while Dark Souls is like "Look its like Gut, did you see the Guts"
[0:50:05] <%krispen_wa> Never forget that Ichiban went to prison for 20 years and Berserk STILL wasn't done when he got out
[0:50:05] <+Genericmistake> I don't think ds has a roll R2 input. Been a long time though so maybe i remember it wrong
[0:50:07] <ronin19xx> Movest*
[0:50:09] <sendart> LUL
[0:50:10] <%blastyoboots> TAKE OFF THE SWORD :O

[0:50:29] <ronin19xx> Sup Goblin
[0:50:31] <CoffeeSlice> THE GOBLINS
[0:50:34] <%krispen_wa> LUL
[0:50:38] <Crashfan01> smol goblins
[0:50:39] <+theunkownhero> seraph202
[0:50:40] <Silenos> So dank weed being used
[0:50:42] <%Indigo_Automaton> Woolie is going to turn ginger by the end of this
[0:50:42] <%jackelzxaa> Does reggie have a club?
[0:50:47] <+mechslayer71> I really would like to see Reggie try out Bloodborne or Sekiro tbh, after he gets used to this type of game with Demon‚Äôs
[0:50:47] <Equirah> @WoolieVersus weappons with the same scalling grade but higher requirements will have better scalling
[0:50:52] <P4oloDiego> punching them is probably better damage
[0:50:53] <ronin19xx> MELTED
[0:50:53] <%blastyoboots> PLEASE punch the skeletons!!!!!!!!
[0:50:55] <%cobalt_phoenix_> LUL
[0:50:57] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[0:50:58] <%ChoculaUltra> zapped
[0:50:59] <ronin19xx> OO
[0:50:59] <KaiserMario> Punching is viable here
[0:50:59] <DeathByPoke7> this is the one level where you can actually punch things
[0:51:00] <+jiggy_snipe> did Woolie say punch?
[0:51:00] <%krispen_wa> LUL LUL
[0:51:01] <Silenos> ouch
[0:51:02] <Louie_Salmon> Hard reads
[0:51:03] <sonofthedeepsouth> EAT IT
[0:51:07] <%BlueJoneleth> reggie damn it run back to the start
[0:51:07] <+theunkownhero> seraph20DSP
[0:51:08] <%Lion_kun> He would probably do more damage with his fist.
[0:51:08] <%hax_metatron> Thief ring?
[0:51:12] <RyuuAoi> It might have to be a roll against these guys
[0:51:12] <+kraajkase> @blastyoboots dude effin chill
[0:51:13] <$BallerSwagBro9k> So far we have made NO PROGRESS
[0:51:15] <%hax_metatron> Thief ring lets him pull not as many skeletons at once
[0:51:16] <Pookiedaexzile> Great Tip: Two hand your sword
[0:51:18] <%cobalt_phoenix_> SPEEN
[0:51:18] <ronin19xx> 4-1 is bru-tal
[0:51:18] <PrideOfFiddles> 2 skellies doable... 3 skellies, send help
[0:51:19] <shadowcrisis> more porridge dear sir
[0:51:19] <fangovafang> aw I came in at da right time lol
[0:51:19] <velgaduere> "I've seen everything" OH NO YOU AIN'T
[0:51:22] <%jackelzxaa> I think woolie wants reggie to become a parry wizard
[0:51:22] <RyuuAoi> THERE. NICE ROLL
[0:51:23] <+jiggy_snipe> Woolie has dropped like 2 tips LUL but Reggie doesn't realize it
[0:51:27] <ronin19xx> But is very rewarding
[0:51:27] <+thotacon_tv> just dropping in to say OH GOD HE IS IN 4-1
[0:51:30] <DSD24> 4-1 is intense like that
[0:51:31] <brunoberserk> punch is actually really good against those skeletons , because of the blunt damage
[0:51:34] <SilverFaustX> thief ring and hide behind rock, backstab..
[0:51:39] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> wait, doesn't reggie have a catalyst as well? he could technically just shhot the skelly bois from safety
[0:51:41] <+Graxe_> The blue fire on getting hit by the arrows means that it's magic damage, right? I forget.
[0:51:52] <+chiazam> I think this area was a bad idea I dunno
[0:52:00] <%BlueJoneleth> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ He only has the magic weapon spell
[0:52:01] <Silenos> no this is perfect
[0:52:02] <velgaduere> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ he only has enchant weapon
[0:52:09] <mihokspawn> Intercept instead of running away
[0:52:11] <%jackelzxaa> The boss of 4-1 is probabyl the second easiest
[0:52:12] <andre11dr> I don't know about this chat, maybe he should do 3-1 DarkMode
[0:52:14] <Louie_Salmon> Walking being better than rolling is the advanced tech
[0:52:15] <Jathspuh> Tekken sidestep
[0:52:22] <+mechslayer71> @graxe_ those are magic missiles or the like, yeah
[0:52:22] <ronin19xx> @chiazam I bet Woolz wants Reg to get Uchi as fast as possible
[0:52:24] <cosmicgoatee> ah yes, 4-1, or as we call it, the bone grinder
[0:52:36] <%jackelzxaa> Does reggie have a club?
[0:52:36] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> ah I see, for some reason I remembered wrongly that he bought the gun
[0:52:44] <+chiazam> @chiazam How far is it from here?
[0:52:47] <+kewlmyc> 2-1 seems like the best next step, but it's Woolie's LP, so whatever. And no, Reggie doesn't have a club
[0:53:05] <PrideOfFiddles> +7 vs +9
[0:53:08] <%BlueJoneleth> 4-1 is good to level up since they give a lot of xp
[0:53:09] <DSD24> Need more D
[0:53:09] <%krispen_wa> The BIGGER D
[0:53:10] <@Solidus_113> that's what she said?
[0:53:10] <velgaduere> "this D is better than THAT D..."
[0:53:13] <mihokspawn> Shotel also has "special thing"
[0:53:15] <%ekodrop> fprdm
[0:53:16] <sonofthedeepsouth> BETTER D?
[0:53:17] <%cobalt_phoenix_> some Ds are better than others
[0:53:19] <RyuuAoi> Initial D
[0:53:21] <sonofthedeepsouth> VAMPIRE HUNTER D
[0:53:24] <Silenos> mmmm betta d Kreygasm
[0:53:25] <LVL1_Scumbag> Only the finest D for Reggie
[0:53:25] <%ekodrop> doesn't it show you the bonus?
[0:53:27] <%Lion_kun> Reggie needs magic and piercing for 2-1
[0:53:34] <%Javaa01> Not all D's are created equal, and that D's a genetic freak
[0:53:37] <andre11dr> Use da better D
[0:53:44] <%BlueJoneleth> Monkey D Woolie
[0:53:45] <ronin19xx> @Lion_kun Spear is optimal
[0:53:47] <%krispen_wa> ...compensate?
[0:53:50] <andre11dr> 2D
[0:53:51] <+cherryceecee> dont you get the magic falchion here?
[0:53:52] <%jackelzxaa> Is lucern in des? Iirc thats the only good dex bash weapon
[0:54:02] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Basically, there's a numerical value behind that letter. The value is a multiplier for that stat.
[0:54:02] <cosmicgoatee> Reggie D Koopy of the Darlington Pirates
[0:54:08] <Silenos> yes... lucern should be
[0:54:11] <%Lion_kun> He has to get by black katanga skeleton to get the falchion
[0:54:24] <DSD24> Oh black katana skeleton

[0:55:01] <RyuuAoi> Rolling is the way
[0:55:03] <shadowcrisis> yes, young lad...you may have all the porridge you desire
[0:55:04] <Pookiedaexzile> Yeah and its getting him killed
[0:55:04] <+Undenizen> sometimes aggression is your best defence
[0:55:08] <%Lion_kun> Magic is effective
[0:55:10] <%krispen_wa> wow that magic damage is real stronk
[0:55:14] <%Cultist_Ryua> He's alive, it's fine.

[1:00:39] <Silenos> so yea he has a long reach
[1:00:43] <santafer> @MyNameIsRasus hey, reggie has experience backstabbing ostrava
[1:00:45] <fangovafang> Dat fuckin infinite roll lmao
[1:00:54] <BlackermanZX> Lord Reggarth the Backstabber doodNuts
[1:00:55] <ronin19xx> Nice backdown
[1:00:57] <andre11dr> Speaking of fighting games, i wonder if Reggie will learn the power of the fist
[1:01:00] <RyuuAoi> YES
[1:01:02] <MyNameIsRasus> @santafer I know, that's why it was funny
[1:01:03] <velgaduere> you really do have to be centered with the asshole
[1:01:03] <ronin19xx> IN HIS ASS
[1:01:05] <RyuuAoi> BACKDOWN BABY
[1:01:06] <%Cultist_Ryua> Good job controlling the enemy and practicing.
[1:01:10] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[1:01:10] <Silenos> We still going PogChamp
[1:01:12] <+mechslayer71> Does Reggie not find the damage he is(n‚Äôt) doing suspicious?
[1:01:13] <Equirah> @WoolieVersus backstab is at 3/4 angle, not staright behind them
[1:01:17] <sonofthedeepsouth> WUT WUT IN THE BUTT

[1:01:40] <YakumoYomi> OH LAWD
[1:01:40] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:01:43] <Silenos> ooo
[1:01:44] <heartlesshealer> Reggie probably doesn't have much experience with RPG skeletons for that damage type reasoning
[1:01:50] <Silenos> big ouch
[1:01:50] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> now to be fair this area is a bit higher level, even pat was having problems with it...but the katana is a good thing to get for a dex boy
[1:01:54] <slix3431> Fight on Moogarth
[1:01:54] <+chiazam> da butt
[1:01:57] <%Cultist_Ryua> Ah, yeah.

[1:02:05] <+megaman_sentinel> greed
[1:02:07] <%wydamn> so close
[1:02:07] <+jiggy_snipe> opened up and destroyed
[1:02:07] <heartlesshealer> Hmmmmm
[1:02:08] <SilverFaustX> GREED
[1:02:08] <%Pillagius> Pillagius subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! This episode is... Reggie and SKELETON WARRIORS!
[1:02:09] <fangovafang> LuvOops dont get greedy
[1:02:09] <+OK__Gamer> you pressured a bit much there man
[1:02:10] <shadowcrisis> cuppeth dine ballsack
[1:02:13] <%Cultist_Ryua> Are blunt weapons better on skellingtons in DES?
[1:02:13] <+mechslayer71> @heartlesshealer not even sharp vs blunt, just general damage output being low
[1:02:16] <+LordCasante> Don't get Greedy
[1:02:17] <Pookiedaexzile> If only you could get a Damage Boost
[1:02:24] <jaygee303> Always save one roll
[1:02:26] <Pookiedaexzile> from using your sword differently
[1:02:28] <therealtacopancakes> I would like to see him try clubchan best waifu
[1:02:30] <ronin19xx> Yeah im glad hes in soul form
[1:02:30] <Zayasu> did reggie pick 4-1 himself?
[1:02:31] <MyNameIsRasus> i said what what
[1:02:34] <%Lion_kun> This isn't Bloodborne.
[1:02:36] <Silenos> I think reggie is doing fine
[1:02:39] <+jiggy_snipe> no Woolie picked it LUL
[1:02:43] <heartlesshealer> @mechslayer71 ah, I haven't been online long enough to know if Reggie's noticed that or not
[1:02:44] <%linSP> you can perma stun these skeles with your barehands
[1:02:47] <+Inverse_Girth> I wish there was a ring that let you roll around like the skeletons
[1:02:51] <RyuuAoi> When in doubt, roll out.
[1:02:52] <%Lion_kun> Never go in with low life
[1:02:53] <SilverFaustX> fist him
[1:02:55] <andre11dr> @ok__gamer Ies ,intact they matter more in DeS than in future Souls games
[1:02:56] <cosmicgoatee> Pot of Greed activated
[1:02:56] <+0neReeler> tracking
[1:03:00] <%wydamn> @Cultist_Ryua They were in DS, I would assume it's the same for DeS but I never made it far
[1:03:09] <+mechslayer71> @heartlesshealer I think woolie actually just told him
[1:03:10] <+wampa661> try pushing in and past more than around the side for a quicker backstab
[1:03:10] <Silenos> Many people went into this level and got overwhelmed by the speed and persistance of the skels here
[1:03:16] <RyuuAoi> Use that centimeter of stamina to roll out
[1:03:30] <heartlesshealer> @mechslayer71 then there is a chance for learning. Yay
[1:03:31] <%Cultist_Ryua> @wydamn Yeah, I didn't get far in des either.
[1:03:32] <Pookiedaexzile> Your doesn't work when you have no stamina
[1:03:39] <MyNameIsRasus> or if he wants to go the blocking route, maybe a better shield would serve him well
[1:03:42] <%p4ntless> gotta let em commit to one of their big swings
[1:03:47] <cosmicgoatee> FailFish
[1:03:48] <ronin19xx> Stamina management
[1:03:52] <jaygee303> Rolled to death
[1:03:54] <+jiggy_snipe> Kappa right....
[1:03:57] <brian_peppers1> thats the hard option WTF Woolie
[1:03:58] <+0neReeler> just block
[1:04:03] <Pookiedaexzile> Woolie is pushing his own agenda
[1:04:12] <+cvp5127> live farming
[1:04:16] <MyNameIsRasus> that's also the hardest one
[1:04:16] <%Lion_kun> Nah buff with magic
[1:04:17] <ronin19xx> Get them souks first
[1:04:17] <slix3431> Moogarth is a hornless bull
[1:04:19] <%linSP> the most pro option
[1:04:19] <+doe3879> Why is he not buying all the grass with souls?????
[1:04:20] <+JackOakLeaf> Why does he not just eat the skeleton
[1:04:23] <Equirah> jsut get punished for 100% damage, ez LUL
[1:04:28] <slix3431> Vache
[1:04:28] <%Cultist_Ryua> lul
[1:04:29] <+NanoComputer> yeah the buff with magic wwould make this easier
[1:04:31] <Silenos> oh he give some mats MVGame
[1:04:34] <sssdrake> woo yeah go reggie!
[1:04:39] <Pookiedaexzile> You can parry with your hand, and two hand for the attacks
[1:04:48] <+megaman_sentinel> yes buff blade
[1:04:50] <+0neReeler> no command grabs can strafe close
[1:04:57] <ronin19xx> Stay close to them
[1:04:57] <slix3431> Vache l'stampde
[1:05:08] <+thegoldenattack> hello
[1:05:08] <RyuuAoi> If you go for the walk around, grind on that body, Reggie.
[1:05:13] <%Pillagius> Wait... isn't bare hand counts as a blunt weapon and does a ton of damage to skeletons?
[1:05:16] <%Cultist_Ryua> This is a good area to practice the basics on.
[1:05:19] <ronin19xx> Yeha hell accept your apology
[1:05:19] <el_biribon> say it
[1:05:20] <%dreadedcthulhu> FEAR IS THE MIND KILLER
[1:05:23] <sonofthedeepsouth> DROP THINE SHIELD
[1:05:23] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> it would probably also be a good idea to maybe just lure the first skeleton up and experiment on him/ watch his moves
[1:05:25] <+NanoComputer> yeah fist work too
[1:05:26] <brian_peppers1> Gotta drop that shield bro....
[1:05:26] <Pookiedaexzile> God damn it
[1:05:28] <Equirah> @Pillagius yup
[1:05:34] <Equirah> free.99
[1:05:38] <+xpakeo> release thy L1 button
[1:05:41] <Silenos> Free magic is free bro
[1:05:50] <therealtacopancakes> mp
[1:05:50] <RyuuAoi> You wanted it, Reggie. USE IT. ha
[1:05:51] <%Grimlockfly> I found 2-1 better for learning parry, which seems key here
[1:05:51] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah that'll happen
[1:05:53] <ronin19xx> Nice
[1:05:54] <+zaitje> Fist is also free
[1:05:58] <+jiggy_snipe> combo
[1:05:58] <BlackermanZX> wombo
[1:06:00] <%DiscoMatador> COMBO
[1:06:03] <FrostedZaibatsu> Toasted
[1:06:03] <ronin19xx> Good DMG
[1:06:04] <heartlesshealer> thanks, magic
[1:06:04] <Silenos> aaa
[1:06:06] <Equirah> reggie's also free LUL
[1:06:07] <andre11dr> You know, i would make more fun of at Reggie's expense here, but the first time a played DeS i did 3-1 first and got wrecked so fucking hard that it became sad
[1:06:08] <Pookiedaexzile> You beat the boss with two hands,
[1:06:09] <%BisoromiBear> now put it all together
[1:06:09] <Silenos> Dying in flames
[1:06:13] <sonofthedeepsouth> IT ALL COMES TUMBLING DOWN
[1:06:14] <Pookiedaexzile> NO IT HASN"T
[1:06:16] <Louie_Salmon> That accidental quick-turn still happens to me sometimes
[1:06:16] <%Pillagius> This stuff needs Skeleton Warriors intro theme playing in the back ground
[1:06:16] <+0neReeler> rest left index
[1:06:20] <%Cultist_Ryua> Just git gud. That's all.
[1:06:20] <%BlueJoneleth> STOP FIGHTING UNDER THAT STAIRCASE lol XD
[1:06:21] <DSD24> Remember how long the dying animation was in PS3 Demons Souls?
[1:06:32] <+BrokenTool> Woolie: "It's free realestate"
[1:06:33] <cosmicgoatee> NotLikeThis Reggie absorb the info
[1:06:39] <Equirah> buff is doubling damage, definetly do that
[1:06:41] <heartlesshealer> reggie must learn spatial awareness
[1:06:46] <+jmstwn> Cash in those souls before catastrophe
[1:06:47] <sprringbreak> The most important tip in souls is the power of walking.
[1:06:50] <+chiazam> oh boy
[1:06:52] <brian_peppers1> You're in control Reggie, not Fred Durst
[1:06:56] <ronin19xx> 4-1 Is a lesson heavy zone
[1:06:57] <%psidefx> Better 1v1's
[1:07:02] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> 4k souls reggies pockets will be overflowing after this
[1:07:06] <Silenos> You think you can cheat fred durst nooo man
[1:07:12] <ronin19xx> IN THE ASS
[1:07:14] <%DiscoMatador> If I had a Hot Rollin Skele Friend I would FIST no Question
[1:07:18] <MyNameIsRasus> CLEAN
[1:07:26] <ronin19xx> Good
[1:07:28] <%Lion_kun> Reggie keeps forgetting to buff his weapon
[1:07:33] <RyuuAoi> Now DO THAT OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN
[1:07:38] <%Pillagius> Why I am imagining Woolie as yoda with dreads torturing Reggie?
[1:07:43] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[1:07:45] <andre11dr> Also 4-1 is extra hard because all the gimmicks it hits you with
[1:07:53] <Silenos> a couple... its almost 5k. we could buy some shinies my man.
[1:07:55] <DeathByPoke7> I forget how much damage fists actually do here
[1:07:58] <ronin19xx> YOOOO
[1:08:01] <fangovafang> He wanted yo cheeks lmao
[1:08:07] <brian_peppers1> Woolie's parry obsession will ruin Reggie
[1:08:10] <heartlesshealer> skeletons have no muscles to tire out with rolling
[1:08:26] <%psidefx> Great trade
[1:08:30] <Equirah> go cash in souls
[1:08:30] <AngryPhant0m> magic man
[1:08:33] <Pookiedaexzile> You have a second hand
[1:08:34] <%Pillagius> Woolie "No try - only do and riposte do you will."
[1:08:36] <ronin19xx> Woolie is trying to make Reggie a parry god
[1:08:46] <brian_peppers1> 1 step forward 1 step back

[1:08:52] <therealtacopancakes> magic weapon buffed the damage to almost twice
[1:08:53] <DeathByPoke7> upgrade weapon?
[1:08:55] <%blastyoboots> Time for FISTS :D fist parry fist parry fist parry
[1:08:56] <cosmicgoatee> this is secretly just a grinding stream
[1:08:57] <+cvp5127> power leveling LUL
[1:08:58] <+0neReeler> can you parry everything...?
[1:08:58] <BaslerJones> DID WE JUST START ?
[1:09:02] <Solidnick18> LUL
[1:09:06] <Pookiedaexzile> AGENDA PUSHED
[1:09:09] <RyuuAoi> @baslerjones Basically
[1:09:10] <%Javaa01> @ronin19xx DeS has a very relaxed timing on it, so this is the best place to learn
[1:09:10] <BlackermanZX> backstabber agenda
[1:09:10] <%Pillagius> @BaslerJones pretty much
[1:09:12] <Equirah> Woolie: today's beans dad Kappa
[1:09:15] <ronin19xx> Heres the obsession
[1:09:16] <+gutlesscoward> woolie wants to recruit reggie into the royal guard
[1:09:19] <andre11dr> So how are you enjoying 4-1 Reggie LUL
[1:09:19] <bevyrage> you can parry everything with the right shield
[1:09:19] <+Graxe_> Isn't the buckler available now?
[1:09:19] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[1:09:20] <Silenos> agenda pushed confirmed MVGame
[1:09:23] <+0neReeler> bean souls
[1:09:24] <%hax_metatron> LUL
[1:09:27] <+Undenizen> Waxface Killa
[1:09:28] <%BisoromiBear> go peep those dirty feet
[1:09:29] <mihokspawn> Waxface :)
[1:09:31] <%linSP> parry with slash does HALF as much damage as a blunt r1
[1:09:34] <Solidnick18> !uptime
[1:09:35] <+OK__Gamer> @chat has Reggie been told aboit blunt damage on the skellies
[1:09:35] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 19 minutes
[1:09:40] <%Cultist_Ryua> It's a good agenda to push though.
[1:09:40] <ronin19xx> Dex
[1:09:40] <$BallerSwagBro9k> BukkaFace
[1:09:40] <+Graxe_> Like you can just buy the buckler from someone?
[1:09:41] <%Lion_kun> Honestly the zone might be too soon for Reggie
[1:09:42] <cosmicgoatee> Reggie VS ascending the Durst Stairs
[1:09:46] <Equirah> @OK__Gamer kinda
[1:09:47] <+doe3879> Buy All the Grass
[1:09:47] <jorniev> DO TOWER OF LATRIA!
[1:09:47] <bevyrage> there's a shield that parries spells in souls games, and projectiles don't get reflected but they lose 90% of their damage for zero extra stamina
[1:09:49] <ronin19xx> Yeah END is good too
[1:09:50] <+jiggy_snipe> @OK__Gamer Woolie dropped 2 hints
[1:09:50] <RyuuAoi> @ok__gamer Of corse
[1:09:53] <slix3431> Moogarth beat tower knight?
[1:09:57] <Pookiedaexzile> TWO HAND
[1:10:09] <ronin19xx> GRIINDDDDD
[1:10:13] <giogio346> when will woolie tell him?
[1:10:15] <scrumbotime> She's BLIND Reggie, if you run away form her without saying anything you're being rude
[1:10:15] <%Cultist_Ryua> He's practicing shield and parry now, so no two hand.
[1:10:16] <ronin19xx> nOW 2 HAND APPROACH
[1:10:21] <heartlesshealer> reggie weaning off of the wrong consumeables =)
[1:10:26] <Equirah> he is, he's basically going "get better than me right now"
[1:10:29] <%Lion_kun> If he is gonna keep beating his head on it, he should buff his weapon every chance he gets.
[1:10:30] <BaslerJones> when will reggie get a better sword
[1:10:32] <ronin19xx> Reg is loving it XD
[1:10:32] <BaslerJones> this one is wack
[1:10:33] <Silenos> I think you are doing great man, just take your time to learn, there is the option of doing no shield entirely to and 2hand that bigboii
[1:10:39] <+megaman_sentinel> buffing seems to be his best option right now
[1:10:49] <+0neReeler> 2hand backstabs
[1:10:49] <RyuuAoi> Skeleton Clan Ain't Nothin' Ta Fuck Wit
[1:10:58] <andre11dr> @scrumbotime Well, it is her fault that she's blind
[1:11:00] <Tuna_Can_0> winning the game is the method
[1:11:09] <+Undenizen> naw man. Parry is a tool in your belt you WANT
[1:11:10] <ronin19xx> Experiment
[1:11:18] <heartlesshealer> two-handed swing
[1:11:20] <DeathByPoke7> there are some moves you can't parry
[1:11:21] <SakuraKun__> think thats only good if your used to bloodborne or sekiro
[1:11:22] <RyuuAoi> That takes some time to get a hang of though, Chat. He gotta get his rolls down too.
[1:11:23] <Pookiedaexzile> Will we Pretend like his Best moments weren't two handing and rolling
[1:11:27] <LoveYouDead> Horizontal swing is the best one to parry.
[1:11:31] <heartlesshealer> parry will not work on that two-hand
[1:11:32] <Pookiedaexzile> HE BEAT THE BOSS WIT HIT
[1:11:33] <DSD24> Tracking the killer of so many people
[1:11:37] <%Cultist_Ryua> IMO the first playthrough should rely heavy on shield.
[1:11:38] <%DiscoMatador> I'm a fan of FISTING myself when it comes to Rolly Boney Bois
[1:11:42] <+0neReeler> @heartlesshealer that's what i thought
[1:11:44] <+wicketpelican> Two hand magic sword would be the best way tbh.
[1:11:48] <ronin19xx> Use those slow animations
[1:11:48] <zoso_xvii> Did you use the code WoolieM yet?
[1:11:52] <%Javaa01> Unless it's Dark Souls 2 with the 180 degree tracking overheads
[1:11:54] <sonofthedeepsouth> I will not parry parry is the mind killer. I will work past the parry
[1:11:57] <+Graxe_> Can also use those soul remains to bait out the skeletons
[1:12:02] <CapCasual> Is Reggie actually pressing the parry button or just tapping block?
[1:12:04] <Pookiedaexzile> He beat tower knight rolling, he makes good reads
[1:12:11] <Solidnick18> almost
[1:12:23] <Equirah> @Pookiedaexzile ehhhhhhhhh
[1:12:30] <cosmicgoatee> I believe in Reggie, I know he can ascend the Diavolo steps
[1:12:30] <+0neReeler> think block because he's getting guard broken animation instead of getting hit?
[1:12:35] <Silenos> Fred durst needs to go on a tour, he doesnt have time MVGame
[1:12:35] <ronin19xx> Blown out
[1:12:36] <+donpatrondx> black tendency incoming
[1:12:38] <+projectmanatees> has reggie tried 2handing yet or is he comfy with shield?
[1:12:45] <%Cultist_Ryua> Good advice.
[1:12:47] <RyuuAoi> Footsies. Backdown
[1:12:48] <Equirah> @projectmanatees neither LUL
[1:12:49] <andre11dr> !uptime
[1:12:49] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 22 minutes
[1:12:53] <%Cultist_Ryua> Spacing is how you manage it.
[1:12:57] <+kewlmyc> Does he have the Thief Ring equipped?
[1:13:05] <RyuuAoi> ROLL OUT
[1:13:05] <heartlesshealer> Reggie is comfy with shield, he's just learning
[1:13:09] <%dreadedcthulhu> default a couple turns
[1:13:19] <%dreadedcthulhu> before u brave
[1:13:23] <ronin19xx> You guys reckon this will be cut for the anime?
[1:13:26] <+CreggaMonsta> do big magic
[1:13:27] <%BisoromiBear> there's no round timer
[1:13:35] <cosmicgoatee> but Reggie Defaults LUL
[1:13:35] <Silenos> The 2hand approach also doesnt mean you cant take your shield with you in the considerations. you can switch styles
[1:13:41] <fangovafang> Souls games are not for button mashers lol I told many ppl dat
[1:13:45] <RyuuAoi> USE THIS TURN TO HEAL
[1:13:47] <Equirah> buff that sword, it's free double damage, less chances of being hit
[1:13:50] <+0neReeler> drawgame
[1:13:50] <Pookiedaexzile> Try two handing once
[1:13:52] <%dreadedcthulhu> DOUBLE K.O.
[1:13:53] <heartlesshealer> trade LUL
[1:13:56] <Pookiedaexzile> once
[1:13:58] <+Graxe_> Double KO
[1:14:04] <giogio346> ResidentSleeper
[1:14:05] <+Inverse_Girth> Tbh I feel like 2-1 is best at teaching damage types with the grunts there
[1:14:12] <cosmicgoatee> DURST C-C-COMBO
[1:14:15] <%zanzibar_junker> no shame in cheese
[1:14:15] <%Cultist_Ryua> The shield helps you stay safe while you learn their movesets. Rolling is just reaction.
[1:14:17] <jibolbadoobies> World tendency is HARD black right now
[1:14:19] <andre11dr> So ,im going to point out that we haven't gone past the beginning of the level
[1:14:20] <%krispen_wa> i dont like backseating, but if its taking him this long to kill 2 dudes, it might be better to give him more experience in a different level

[1:15:00] <Equirah> @krispen_wa i think woolie wants the crescnet falchion and then postpones the rest of the level for another time
[1:15:01] <+Graxe_> Coming here is fine, just a bigger curve since the skeletons are aggressive
[1:15:04] <%Seancicle> KPOPvictory don't anticipate your shot, let it surprise you
[1:15:05] <+doe3879> You can Dodge without rolling.
[1:15:06] <%Lion_kun> He can do it with a blunt weapon or if he buffs with magic.

[1:15:08] <cosmicgoatee> naw @mrpedrovsky let the grasshopper learn
[1:15:09] <%Pillagius> Despite Woolie and Reggie joint effort Reggie keeps suffering bone-crushing defeats. Maybe Reggie just needs more calcium.

[1:19:27] <+crossing_mao> The matchup huh..
[1:19:32] <%blastyoboots> Woolie have mercy on him already, tell him to switch to his Fist and make this fight easier
[1:19:38] <andre11dr> Just wait till the mantarays become a factor
[1:19:38] <Silenos> yes
[1:19:45] <ronin19xx> This is a very complex enemy
[1:19:49] <%NoDices> NoDices subscribed with Prime.
[1:19:49] <%krispen_wa> alright im heading out for now. maybe he'll have made progress in an hour
[1:19:52] <+CreggaMonsta> o yea they are weak to blunt
[1:19:55] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> do nothing but backstab lol
[1:19:55] <+Inverse_Girth> @ronin19xx Maybe, I didn‚Äôt really have any trouble on the blue with a club but the red took a while to learn how to bait
[1:19:56] <+TechnicalCultist> forget spooky and scary, these skeletons are slippin and slidin
[1:19:59] <ronin19xx> One of the hardest jobber enemy here
[1:20:07] <%Cultist_Ryua> If there's an attack you can't predict, just block and make an opening.
[1:20:08] <KaiserMario> Sword durability at 75%
[1:20:10] <+Graxe_> Especially now that they added more directionality in rolling here in the remake
[1:20:12] <Silenos> yes... delayed attacks is a hassle, cause they can cancel your invis frames.
[1:20:14] <cosmicgoatee> he has yet to ascend the stairs LUL I believe in Reggarth, warrior of grass
[1:20:18] <+Graxe_> Instead of just limited directions
[1:20:21] <+CreggaMonsta> dont u need to drop sheild to back stab?
[1:20:26] <sprringbreak> all he has to learn is the counter strafe
[1:20:27] <therealtacopancakes> he had his shield up thoo
[1:20:28] <Equirah> stop trading NotLikeThis
[1:20:33] <KaiserMario> A LOT
[1:20:35] <Pookiedaexzile> Try two handing Once
[1:20:35] <%SarcFa> also remember, shield up and backstabs are not compatible
[1:20:36] <Sunstalker> it is
[1:20:36] <brunoberserk> A LOT
[1:20:36] <%Pillagius> Do the punch!
[1:20:36] <%hax_metatron> A LOT
[1:20:37] <Zayasu> TRY IT
[1:20:38] <MyNameIsRasus> A LOT
[1:20:39] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[1:20:39] <+Graxe_> Try it
[1:20:39] <%krispen_wa> DO IT
[1:20:39] <LunarRemix> Does a lot damage
[1:20:41] <andre11dr> YES
[1:20:41] <+0neReeler> oraoraoraora
[1:20:42] <$BallerSwagBro9k> DO IT
[1:20:42] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus It's totally viable
[1:20:43] <+jiggy_snipe> idk give it a try
[1:20:43] <%hax_metatron> PUNCH = BLUNT
[1:20:43] <%blastyoboots> SO MUCH, TRY IT
[1:20:45] <+kewlmyc> More actually since its blunt
[1:20:46] <KaiserMario> More than the sword actually
[1:20:46] <%Cultist_Ryua> @CreggaMonsta Oh, that's probably why he cna't backstab.
[1:20:47] <Karebuncle> punching is pretty stroong
[1:20:48] <+Graxe_> Just gotta be close
[1:20:50] <DeathByPoke7> trust only your FISTS
[1:20:52] <Silenos> its a strat, but maybe not the greatest
[1:20:52] <Equirah> BUFF THE PUNCH LUL
[1:20:53] <+BettyMwwaahh> l,ao yea real subtle woolie
[1:20:54] <Tuna_Can_0> 2 Hand your fist KEKW
[1:20:57] <MyNameIsRasus> SICK ROLL
[1:20:58] <+crossing_mao> Is this happening with every new enemy?
[1:20:58] <%linSP> go ora ora
[1:20:59] <LunarRemix> Like around 80 per swing?
[1:21:00] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus The punch attack in this game is classed as Blunt damage, which these guys are weak against
[1:21:00] <%blastyoboots> you will not BELIEVE how much damage it does please try it
[1:21:03] <ronin19xx> Thisll make Reg more aware
[1:21:03] <+Graxe_> Backstab with your fist
[1:21:04] <+TheotherKristian> Blunt is better against skeletons, fist is a blunt weapon
[1:21:04] <%Pillagius> show them that your Kung Fu is stronger, Reggie!
[1:21:06] <Karebuncle> but mostly just use bludgeoning damage, its D&D rules
[1:21:06] <PrideOfFiddles> Bare handed it's like 5-hits to defeat 1 skelly
[1:21:06] <therealtacopancakes> noooo, try the club!
[1:21:08] <LeBlanc233> looking good
[1:21:08] <%hax_metatron> FISTS = BLUNT
[1:21:15] <%Lion_kun> Reggie, this isn't a fighting game, the best strat is to optimize with a blunt weapon, buff it with magic and kill them in 2 swings before they can do anything.
[1:21:15] <%linSP> fists stun them, and they‚Äôre fast
[1:21:23] <Silenos> We burnin!
[1:21:24] <+CreggaMonsta> @Cultist_Ryua i think so i might be wrong?

[1:42:03] <whirly25> Some mfs are always tryin to ice skate uphill
[1:42:05] <heartlesshealer> reggie hasn't found good gauntlets yet for possible punch build I think
[1:42:07] <MyNameIsRasus> Did he equip grass
[1:42:07] <%Javaa01> Backhand parry into fist riposte for maximum fisting
[1:42:09] <bradley1990> im only here for the back downs

[1:42:44] <ronin19xx> I want Reg to pop off

[1:44:15] <RyuuAoi> YOU CAN. REGGIE
[1:44:15] <Silenos> They call him, the bonefister
[1:44:21] <Tuna_Can_0> just never lock on 4Head
[1:44:29] <jonblnt> fight them on you're terms
[1:44:32] <Pookiedaexzile> Yeah this is something that can be used all the time
[1:44:35] <Pookiedaexzile> and not a bad habbit
[1:44:38] <+jiggy_snipe> Reggarth Backstabber the Bonefister
[1:44:46] <%Terrarp> A little more to the right and he could backstab every single one of this guys
[1:44:50] <deadbrainpl> I'm getting memories of my DS2 Bone Fist build...good times
[1:44:54] <Equirah> @WoolieVersus does reggie have a club on him?
[1:45:00] <%Neryl_> Neryl_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months!
[1:45:05] <heartlesshealer> Does Demon's Souls buffer inputs, or is Reggie just bravely pressing?
[1:45:06] <user_naim> Caestus Baestus
[1:45:18] <%TrafficCohen> @heartlesshealer It buffers
[1:45:19] <Equirah> @heartlesshealer both
[1:45:21] <+Grayhammatter> oof
[1:45:22] <mgotacon> It does buffer inputs.
[1:45:23] <Pookiedaexzile> Can we try the two hands
[1:45:24] <RyuuAoi> Yiu gotta heal, Reggie
[1:45:25] <heartlesshealer> I see
[1:45:28] <%Cultist_Ryua> Yeah, both.
[1:45:29] <%ekodrop> this is the brute force method
[1:45:30] <cosmicgoatee> Moogarth nooo
[1:45:33] <heartlesshealer> Mashing is never the way
[1:45:37] <%ekodrop> no learnin' here
[1:45:43] <RyuuAoi> Defense is just as important as offense.
[1:45:45] <+zzNamttamzz> the chip is real
[1:45:50] <Silenos> Yea the shields can sometimes fully block, but they also have more weight typically
[1:45:52] <bradley1990> dont get good, simply be good
[1:45:54] <+brightman42> can he buy or get the heater shield? that's a 100% ain't it?
[1:45:55] <KaiserMario> Poor Reggie is getting mad, I can hear his tone! He's SO MAD LUL
[1:45:57] <Pookiedaexzile> The best defense is not geting hit
[1:46:01] <mgotacon> You you need to face them.
[1:46:04] <%Puhff> You need a bigger shield Bubbus
[1:46:06] <Tuna_Can_0> dont tell him calebKek
[1:46:07] <%ekodrop> not if you're facing away
[1:46:14] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[1:46:17] <+chiazam> shield poke

[1:46:28] <%Puhff> For the style you fight
[1:46:28] <+Grayhammatter> he speen
[1:46:33] <heartlesshealer> that's a danger catch, he was still rolling at that geometry
[1:46:35] <%Terrarp> @brightman42 Yep, and he could get it very easily and cheap
[1:46:40] <RyuuAoi> Reminds me of my first time playing Bloodborne doe. Banged my head on jobbers for hours. It'll come.
[1:46:46] <Manmush> prototype wheel skeleton
[1:46:47] <%hax_metatron> This reminds me of that staircase in the Painted World in the DS1 LP
[1:47:04] <cosmicgoatee> moooo
[1:47:04] <%hax_metatron> But Reggie you're doing great! The improvement is VISIBLE
[1:47:05] <+CreggaMonsta> yea jobbers in bloodbrone messed me up
[1:47:08] <Silenos> Sometimes it pays to not lockon tho
[1:47:09] <penitentpendant> How much that club cost?
[1:47:09] <LunarRemix> It's okay Reggie, almost everyone has a play session like this
[1:47:15] <Pookiedaexzile> So close
[1:47:18] <%Terrarp> @ryuuaoi it's the way it has to be, he needs to learn and that's what's important
[1:47:21] <Brutalyte616> Reggie needs a better shield.
[1:47:24] <$BallerSwagBro9k> THE REGGIE HOLE
[1:47:25] <Equirah> @WoolieVersus equip the better weapon
[1:47:33] <mgotacon> This^
[1:47:34] <$USOtaku> I just showed up, why is he punching these monsters?
[1:47:36] <%ekodrop> if you're gonna block use a better shield....
[1:47:38] <RyuuAoi> @terrarp Abso-fucking-lutely
[1:47:39] <heartlesshealer> I like how it's still the old sword
[1:47:44] <Pookiedaexzile> Reggie needs to leave shields behind and use what killed the last boss he beat
[1:47:50] <+Solid_Stro> At first there was the Woolie Hole, but now we have entered the Reggie Hole lytLURK
[1:47:55] <mgotacon> I think they have a better shield too.
[1:48:02] <Tuna_Can_0> losing to the discount wheelie boys calebKek
[1:48:07] <+jiggy_snipe> @USOtaku Skeletons are weak to blunt damage, punches are blunt
[1:48:08] <penitentpendant> Run to the bonfire!
[1:48:09] <%blastyoboots> @USOtaku punching does more damage than his unmagic'd sword because it's blunt damage
[1:48:11] <Pookiedaexzile> Reggie has never had success with a sheild for the whole of the last playthu
[1:48:12] <user_naim> Demon‚Äôs Souls: The New Generation
[1:48:15] <heartlesshealer> F
[1:48:17] <%Cultist_Ryua> You've gotta learn sword and board though. It teaches spacing.
[1:48:21] <+doe3879> is that Shield even blocking %100 physical?
[1:48:25] <heartlesshealer> so hey, that Kilij
[1:48:29] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Can you reassure Reggie that he's doing good? This area is super hard for beginners!
[1:48:29] <Pookiedaexzile> Rolling teaches spacing faster
[1:48:30] <Equirah> @doe3879 nope
[1:48:31] <%SarcFa> shield is 90% block
[1:48:33] <slix3431> If you played a drinking game here you're dead
[1:48:34] <@Solidus_113> okay... THIS time
[1:48:35] <mgotacon> Equip the new sword, it's longer than the broadsword.
[1:48:35] <%TrafficCohen> @doe3879 No, 90 or 80 % I think
[1:48:36] <+wampa661> DOnt forget the kilij now! Straight upgrade in weapon
[1:48:37] <PrideOfFiddles> When are we getting off the staircase arc?
[1:48:38] <%gatorafan> every time?
[1:48:38] <+brightman42> thief ring and kilij
[1:48:39] <$USOtaku> @jiggy_snipe @blastyoboots Thank you
[1:48:39] <Silenos> Everytime but not this time Kappa
[1:48:41] <cosmicgoatee> yeah but this time tho
[1:48:43] <haitakaa> I think 90 percent
[1:48:44] <%Lion_kun> Fist has stagger but low range, Sword has range but no stagger. If only there was a way to combine the two.
[1:48:49] <slix3431> Drink everytime Reggie dies
[1:48:52] <user_naim> So Far Cry 3 when?
[1:48:53] <heartlesshealer> good punch

[2:02:35] <penitentpendant> Pre-enchanted
[2:02:36] <%A_German_spy> @Cultist_Ryua But it doesn't need it. It basically has a buff built in.
[2:02:38] <heartlesshealer> already magic
[2:02:38] <+brightman42> it's perma-buffed
[2:02:41] <+Graxe_> Yeah
[2:02:44] <+0neReeler> ezmode active
[2:02:45] <+Graxe_> It has the magic buff already
[2:02:53] <%Cultist_Ryua> He should use the physical defense spell in this case.
[2:02:53] <MyNameIsRasus> It has what is basically a permabuff
[2:03:08] <Silenos> Interestingly that also means you could use another magic, instead of enchant weapon then
[2:03:15] <RyuuAoi> Nice
[2:03:19] <%astrofizzix> Well, that's one way to stop Reggie from using the pine resin.
[2:03:22] <RyuuAoi> USE THAT

[2:06:40] <Silenos> 2 shields when you want to become hodor
[2:06:48] <pi_in_the_sci> he can buy a heater shield at the shop
[2:06:51] <+zzNamttamzz> shop has shield?
[2:07:00] <mgotacon> If you put one into END and one into STR you'd probably be able to fast roll with that shield.
[2:07:08] <%Cultist_Ryua> Or you can change out your spell slot.
[2:07:10] <brunoberserk> unequip the catalyst
[2:07:12] <sendart> he could go buy a spell
[2:07:18] <Silenos> yea the staff is very light

[2:07:24] <+megaman_sentinel> arrows
[2:07:31] <@Solidus_113> one level
[2:07:39] <penitentpendant> Equip lighter armor?
[2:07:46] <RyuuAoi> Back to your old armor
[2:07:48] <notsoy> with the crescent falchion you don't even need magic anymore
[2:07:56] <andre11dr> Also could just run around bare chested
[2:08:03] <Silenos> Just go no pants :)
[2:08:03] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus If you like, you could put on lighter body armor to clear some equip weight. Heavy armor in this game has severely diminishing returns on the defense-to-weight ratio.
[2:08:37] <+LazyEyed_Jalen> How's reggie been doing?
[2:08:46] <MyNameIsRasus> He's been doing fine
[2:08:49] <MyNameIsRasus> punchin some bones

[2:09:23] <mgotacon> It's END
[2:09:28] <%SarcFa> He needs 16 to actually use the shield properly
[2:09:30] <PrideOfFiddles> Endurance raises equip
[2:09:32] <RyuuAoi> @lazyeyed_jalen Reggie WILL figure it out.
[2:09:33] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Endurance raises Equip Burden. Strength doesn't.
[2:09:42] <+LazyEyed_Jalen> yoooo, no weapon, fist run NG+ wheeeeeen
[2:09:44] <brian_peppers1> oh no
[2:09:46] <penitentpendant> Time to farm skeletons for a while, it seems
[2:09:49] <+brightman42> endurance is so good
[2:10:07] <%gatorafan> SKELETON FARMER!
[2:10:13] <therealtacopancakes> but the shield needs 16
[2:10:16] <%guardian_collin> woolieSMUG
[2:10:23] <Silenos> yea gotta get two levels
[2:10:23] <%dreadedcthulhu> he's not gna be able to block with this shield unless he upgrades str one more time
[2:10:29] <MyNameIsRasus> The shield needs 16 strength tho
[2:10:33] <Pookiedaexzile> Member how you beat this area

[2:10:40] <%SarcFa> @A_German_spy While strength doesn't increase equip burden, Reggie still needs 16 strength for the shield
[2:10:59] <Silenos> oh you missed a small drop :)
[2:10:59] <%A_German_spy> @SarcFa I'm aware, but they'll figure that part out when he tries to block with it
[2:11:00] <penitentpendant> Grass drop

[2:12:10] <+Thunder_Poo> Drop the shield!..good
[2:12:12] <%holydeviant1> I wonder how happy Reggie will be to learn that throwing weapons scale in later games
[2:12:12] <penitentpendant> Not enough STR~
[2:12:15] <%SarcFa> It's just people were acting like Reggie made a huge mistake going for strength
[2:12:25] <%SarcFa> when that was a goal too :P
[2:12:25] <Silenos> yea just 1 more level
[2:12:29] <+Thunder_Poo> See what I mean!
[2:12:41] <%A_German_spy> @SarcFa Worry not. They'll remember.
[2:12:57] <deadbrainpl> P E R F E C T
[2:13:00] <+LazyEyed_Jalen> Also did woolie remove the early DS streams? i usually watch the vods, but when i went to look they were gone

[2:13:35] <Silenos> He wants to use a sword so :D
[2:13:38] <+kewlmyc> Why are they using a shield he can't use?
[2:13:38] <redrins> Kappa
[2:13:43] <andre11dr> I don't think they are weak to magic aren't they?
[2:13:43] <velgaduere> @LazyEyed_Jalen most content is being ejected from twitch because of DMCA, but it's always on youtube
[2:13:45] <+Grayhammatter> the godhand
[2:13:48] <+0neReeler> str build instead of int
[2:13:49] <+Thunder_Poo> Where's the Pat Navi!?
[2:13:53] <Silenos> @kewlmyc need 1 more level to get it
[2:13:55] <+Dannzzyy> @woolieversus you can farm 1-3 black knights. You get souls and grass. Plus they are next to the spawn point.
[2:14:00] <notsoy> are shield str minimums not actually relevant for purely defensive purposes?
[2:14:00] <+megaman_sentinel> bleed
[2:14:05] <DrJamesWoods> Why is he punching people?
[2:14:07] <krabsan> no weapon LUL
[2:14:20] <%Lion_kun> You can't buff a crescent falchion, can you?
[2:14:22] <penitentpendant> @DrJamesWoods It's his best Blunt Weapon atm
[2:14:26] <MyNameIsRasus> because punching rules
[2:14:26] <DrJamesWoods> LOL
[2:14:30] <+0neReeler> can you 2hand fists PogChamp
[2:14:35] <Pookiedaexzile> YES

[2:14:38] <+Thunder_Poo> p e r f e c t
[2:14:38] <haitakaa> the skellys are weak to blunt I believe
[2:14:39] <Silenos> sort of onereeler
[2:14:42] <RyuuAoi> No downside to using that shield now.
[2:14:44] <VincentGraves> if you don't have the strength for a shield, you take more stamina damage when blocking
[2:14:47] <%Cultist_Ryua> He just loses more stamina from that shield.
[2:14:53] <~WoolieVersus> @Dannzzyy and hows he supposed to get to 1-3
[2:14:54] <$BallerSwagBro9k> WAIT HES STILL HERE? LUL

[2:15:23] <velgaduere> @WoolieVersus I think he means the Tower Knight archstone
[2:15:30] <PrideOfFiddles> I think he means before the tower knight boss door @WoolieVersus
[2:15:35] <+0neReeler> fist main
[2:15:37] <+Dannzzyy> @woolieversus it is the tower knight room. Right before the boss there are two black knights.
[2:15:47] <redrins> those are blue
[2:15:51] <reonome> f
[2:15:54] <+Grayhammatter> F
[2:15:54] <+liquidzr0> mikeriTEA
[2:15:55] <andyfutrell> Cheer500 we just need the ability to use kicks in this game and he can be reggie the foot knight of the fetish kingdom
[2:15:58] <penitentpendant> Not enough STR means you get blocking penalties~
[2:16:01] <%Puhff> adumF adumF adumF
[2:16:01] <%Lion_kun> The best farming spot is the 1-2 archstone right now
[2:16:02] <krabsan> all enemies in the 2nd archstone are weak to magic right?
[2:16:04] <MyNameIsRasus> YOU'RE DOING GREAT REGGIE
[2:16:05] <Pookiedaexzile> Try two handing
[2:16:11] <Zayasu> yeah the tower knight place is a great farming location for grass
[2:16:11] <fangovafang> Is their a finisher for da Fist?
[2:16:14] <Silenos> grass farming and getting that 1 level
[2:16:33] <+LazyEyed_Jalen> big punchies gwdSlap gwdSlap gwdSlap
[2:16:37] <%Cultist_Ryua> That stamina damage.
[2:16:40] <%MajkirM> @woolieversus they are a guaranteed 2 hal moons each
[2:16:42] <RyuuAoi> Are we farming or going for progress? That is the question.
[2:16:50] <krabsan> also he could get the holy mace in 5 to wreck this level
[2:16:53] <%Lion_kun> I think Reggie should just do another area, he's too weak right now
[2:16:56] <Pookiedaexzile> Firmly a Parry Parent at this point
[2:16:59] <RyuuAoi> Reggie could farm in the lab.
[2:17:00] <PrideOfFiddles> Oh, are attacks not bouncing off the shield because he lacks stat requirements for shield?
[2:17:01] <+0neReeler> guess he hasn't found THAT strat
[2:17:10] <penitentpendant> @PrideOfFiddles Pretty much
[2:17:15] <MyNameIsRasus> LUL
[2:17:16] <DrJamesWoods> Rollin around
[2:17:17] <Pookiedaexzile> Try two handing once
[2:17:17] <+Grayhammatter> your shield is actively sabotaging your stamina
[2:17:18] <+Thunder_Poo> s e e w h a t I m e a n ?
[2:17:23] <Pookiedaexzile> TRY IT ONCE
[2:17:31] <PrideOfFiddles> I've never seen that happen LUL learn something new every day with this game
[2:17:37] <+doe3879> stop trying to lvl up, fill up on grass
[2:17:37] <velgaduere> I think at least showing him the farm would be a good idea
[2:17:46] <user_naim> Put the shit shield back maybe?
[2:17:47] <Silenos> both are valid, but you should consider getting the last point in strength
[2:17:51] <velgaduere> he wouldn't know about it otherwise
[2:17:54] <PrideOfFiddles> @penitentpendant Ty :D
[2:17:55] <+chiazam> Oh man what if he two handed with fists
[2:18:03] <penitentpendant> I-frames~
[2:18:06] <+Grayhammatter> LUL

[2:19:03] <redrins> two handing fist in des? LUL
[2:19:07] <andre11dr> Two handing your fist is probably the dumbest thing in these games, it looks hilarious

[2:19:09] <Tuna_Can_0> 2 hand fists LUL
[2:19:09] <PrideOfFiddles> "Knights do it with 2-hands"
[2:19:10] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus You can't two-hand the fist in this game, sadly. Fist weapons, yes, but not the bare hand

[2:19:28] <RyuuAoi> One Guy
[2:19:29] <+Thunder_Poo> rip
[2:19:32] <lovesosa236> were fist ever viable in this game or was that ds3?
[2:19:43] <%Indigo_Automaton> DS3 fists were barely viable
[2:19:43] <Silenos> its viable here, and with the weapon for the fist
[2:19:43] <mgotacon> Stunlocked
[2:19:46] <%A_German_spy> @lovesosa236 It was DS2
[2:19:48] <%BlueJoneleth> there's a mace right at the start of 5-1 no?
[2:19:48] <brian_peppers1> the r1 spam
[2:19:53] <%SarcFa> bare fist build was with a ring in Ds2 iirc
[2:19:54] <+Exicuren> DS3 and 2

[2:20:05] <Zayasu> @A_German_spy best souls 2 PogChamp
[2:20:11] <+drinkmoxie> Reggie single handedly keep the grass market a float
[2:20:17] <Silenos> you can make basically anything viable if you want it enough.
[2:20:18] <%Indigo_Automaton> The demonfists were cool but basically just a gimmick weapon
[2:20:19] <%jetjagger222> or is it cesti
[2:20:19] <andre11dr> Demon Fist was pretty good in DS3
[2:20:20] <%A_German_spy> @lovesosa236 They're viable in the early game in Demon's Souls against enemies weak against blunt damage, as well as for their unique shove attack which is an inescapeable infinite, but that's it
[2:20:25] <Pookiedaexzile> Cresent sword dual wielding and he wouldn't have to kite the enemy every run,
[2:20:30] <user_naim> Auto-tracking overheads
[2:20:30] <Ookamiden02> "can you believe all this blood is from one person?"
[2:20:35] <user_naim> gotta love em
[2:20:37] <velgaduere> every time? every time.
[2:20:39] <therealtacopancakes> give a blunt weapon a try?
[2:20:45] <Pookiedaexzile> he could roll, like he did all last stream
[2:20:59] <RyuuAoi> Every time
[2:20:59] <%A_German_spy> @therealtacopancakes He's using one.
[2:21:05] <+Grayhammatter> everytime
[2:21:06] <Silenos> maybe everytime

[2:21:16] <%jetjagger222> SKELETON WARRIAS
[2:21:18] <el_biribon> reggie might be going insane
[2:21:24] <%TrafficCohen> Go 5-1 and get the Mace at the start Woolie
[2:21:26] <penitentpendant> At this point, don't heal just sit and reset
[2:21:27] <andre11dr> Maybe it's time to tell Reggie about the headbutt
[2:21:29] <user_naim> The REAL AGDQ over here
[2:21:34] <+AnIrishPapaya> This is rough to watch. Imma dip
[2:21:34] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> h-hayai
[2:21:38] <brian_peppers1> if this was ds1 there'd be a vagrant here
[2:21:48] <+Checktrap> Y‚Äôall don‚Äôt understand blind runs ?
[2:21:48] <%ColonelTyphoon> it's because you don't have enough strength
[2:21:50] <%Lion_kun> Reggie, you're not ready for this zone.
[2:21:51] <MyNameIsRasus> Because you don't have the stats
[2:21:51] <+Grayhammatter> it's your shield
[2:21:53] <Pookiedaexzile> Cresent sword two handed
[2:21:54] <glass_marcus> because you are weak
[2:21:57] <redrins> lack of stats on your shield will do that
[2:22:00] <%Cultist_Ryua> Because you don't have the stats on the shield.
[2:22:01] <PrideOfFiddles> Reggie vs skellie
[2:22:02] <Pookiedaexzile> once
[2:22:05] <penitentpendant> He's one STR short of that shield. He can't block properly with it atm.
[2:22:08] <redrins> to wield it I mean
[2:22:08] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Yeah once Reggie gets in and levels up this will be less tedious
[2:22:10] <KaiserMario> You need the 16 strength
[2:22:11] <user_naim> shield stats maybe?
[2:22:19] <%ekodrop> learn to parry...
[2:22:21] <ronin19xx> The required stat Woolz
[2:22:27] <+drinkmoxie> I think Woolie should adopt the Pat/Paige approach and every time Reggie makes a mistake play the air-horn sound
[2:22:34] <%TrafficCohen> HONK
[2:22:38] <slix3431> Man, anyone else notice the puddles in the first part of this zone? LUL LUL
[2:22:44] <Pookiedaexzile> I think Chat deserves the Airhorn
[2:22:46] <%Dakuu75> s that guy ok?
[2:22:56] <BaslerJones> ROLLING ROLLING ROLLING
[2:23:00] <VincentGraves> he just needs a club, really. Then this are becomes more manageable.
[2:23:00] <%cobalt_phoenix_> I've been gone for like an hour, is reggie still at the stairs?
[2:23:06] <Wessuri> what's up guys! how is the run going?
[2:23:08] <penitentpendant> @Pookiedaexzile No, it would be abused IMMEDIATELY
[2:23:12] <%Dakuu75> he's got places to go, he's gotta follow his rainbow
[2:23:17] <andre11dr> @slix3431 Yea, that's not from the skeletons tho
[2:23:31] <%Cultist_Ryua> It seems to break differently when his stamina runs out.
[2:23:33] <andre11dr> It from.....pure black
[2:23:34] <%ekodrop> what even is the point of this??
[2:23:44] <+drinkmoxie> That guy rolling into that rock endlessly is a great analogy for Reggies run this stream
[2:23:46] <Pookiedaexzile> @penitentpendant got anything to say about it
[2:23:50] <+askalta> camera speed is super adjustable
[2:23:52] <+saltpiggu> why does reggie not have a weapon on
[2:23:52] <+0neReeler> too risk
[2:23:54] <+Exicuren> It would be better to get a club ir a mace and bat those skeletons to dust
[2:23:55] <Silenos> Skeletons are like... i roll. but its a job MVGame
[2:23:58] <+JingKaisean> fists only run
[2:24:06] <slix3431> So the rain is cool huh guys?
[2:24:07] <%A_German_spy> @saltpiggu Bare fists are strong against this enemy type
[2:24:12] <MyNameIsRasus> @saltpiggu because punching is better against these guys than any weapon he has
[2:24:29] <%ColonelTyphoon> Woolie, not enough strength on shield = big penalty on stability
[2:24:30] <+saltpiggu> oh normally you have a mace by now for blugeoning
[2:24:32] <Matermind0> Not having enough strength for that shield is killing him
[2:24:34] <%Pillagius> Am I in a time bubble? Clock is showing it's been 2 and a half hours but Reggie is in exact same place still!
[2:24:34] <+0neReeler> pick up souls, drop souls
[2:24:34] <mgotacon> Kjilt buffed might be good.
[2:24:35] <Pookiedaexzile> Woolie will literally reccomend anything but two handing his sword
[2:24:37] <penitentpendant> @Pookiedaexzile Chat is equivalent to a Hydra. Many heads, many purposes. You can't give it power because the worst head would use it to its own ends.
[2:24:39] <user_naim> HONK
[2:24:41] <%ekodrop> we're at 2hr+ in and still at 4-1 start
[2:24:42] <%Klefth> "Well fuck you, too" ‚ÄîThat skeleton, probably
[2:24:45] <Silenos> Clubs hit real gud on these boiis
[2:24:52] <+askalta> hammers 4 days
[2:24:53] <ronin19xx> I dint know why Woolz is not mentioning the stat req
[2:24:58] <user_naim> Club gets range
[2:24:59] <jorniev> NO SIR FACK A YOU
[2:24:59] <+0neReeler> PUNCH
[2:25:02] <%TrafficCohen> There's a Mace early in 5-1 I think @WoolieVersus
[2:25:04] <Octopimp> the club BETTER not be a possibility, especially with the pandemic around
[2:25:05] <+CreggaMonsta> this is how a blind run goes
[2:25:06] <+cvp5127> UNDA BUNGA
[2:25:07] <%BlueJoneleth> 5-1
[2:25:08] <dan_g_v> everybody knows skeletons are weak against club on souls games
[2:25:08] <Octopimp> oh....that kind of club
[2:25:09] <%Lion_kun> Club buffed with magic.
[2:25:09] <+Checktrap> This shield aint helping him
[2:25:10] <Matermind0> He‚Äôs gotten worse after swapping shields
[2:25:11] <%BlueJoneleth> start
[2:25:14] <+CreggaMonsta> this is the souls exp
[2:25:15] <%Dapper_Cactuar> all fear the bonk stick
[2:25:19] <+0neReeler> frombehind
[2:25:20] <+LordCasante> correct me if I am wrong, but isn't there a mace he can pick up in early 5-1?
[2:25:20] <%A_German_spy> @Lion_kun The club can't be buffed
[2:25:21] <+liquidzr0> merchant sells club and there is a club in 2-1
[2:25:23] <+chiazam> no fuck you
[2:25:23] <jaygee303> These first couple streams were always going to be like this, don‚Äôt bash him for learning the fundamentals
[2:25:23] <deadbrainpl> UNGA BUNGA gives him more range too
[2:25:25] <therealtacopancakes> yaaay club, it cheap it hiit strronk
[2:25:26] <+askalta> does he have enough str to use any hammer?
[2:25:27] <jorniev> YOU CAN FIND ME AT THE- CLUB!

[2:25:45] <%Cultist_Ryua> No
[2:25:47] <%ColonelTyphoon> not nearly as effectivly, the gaurd breaks way easier
[2:25:47] <%Lion_kun> That's weird a normal club can't be buffed.
[2:25:47] <%Cultist_Ryua> Well
[2:25:50] <brian_peppers1> "effectively"
[2:25:52] <andre11dr> I would be so funny if Reggie kept dying here in human form and eventually started getting killed on spawn by Satsuki
[2:25:53] <pi_in_the_sci> it blows through stamina quicker
[2:25:54] <RyuuAoi> That's the case
[2:25:55] <VincentGraves> he takes more stamina damage
[2:25:56] <%dreadedcthulhu> u dont deflect attacks and it looks like more stamina drain on block
[2:25:57] <MyNameIsRasus> It costs much more stamina
[2:25:59] <Matermind0> He loses more stamina
[2:26:00] <+askalta> the stability is messed up
[2:26:00] <%SarcFa> Stamina usage on blocking is massively increased
[2:26:00] <therealtacopancakes> nope
[2:26:01] <penitentpendant> Enemies don't bounce of the shield, stamina consumption goes up to
[2:26:01] <boltstrykex> no
[2:26:02] <+Grayhammatter> 100% is blocked, it take more stamina damage
[2:26:03] <%Lion_kun> Lose much more stamina.
[2:26:04] <ronin19xx> Stability is gone
[2:26:05] <+mechslayer71> The stamina loss hurts
[2:26:05] <velgaduere> more stam drain
[2:26:05] <+patriotrenegade> Takes more stamina
[2:26:06] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus No, the low requirements mean he takes extra stamina damage
[2:26:06] <+0neReeler> massive stamina loss
[2:26:08] <+BeeeOhhh> Hey Woolie, Reggie and Chat!
[2:26:08] <%holydeviant1> Stability is ruined
[2:26:09] <+branlomanche> he loses more stamina
[2:26:09] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:26:11] <deadbrainpl> Yes but it drains more stamina
[2:26:11] <Zayasu> @WoolieVersus takes staminer
[2:26:11] <%ColonelTyphoon> the stability is taking a big penalty
[2:26:12] <%ekodrop> stamina issues
[2:26:14] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus If you don't meet the stat requirements, you lose far more stamina from blocking. That's why he keeps getting his guard open. It still blocks 100% damage, but look how much stamina it drains.
[2:26:17] <VincentGraves> he keeps getting opened up
[2:26:19] <+Exicuren> Stamina drain, yed
[2:26:19] <Pookiedaexzile> We finna go find half the weapons before two hands
[2:26:20] <%Javaa01> And attacks can't bounce off the shield without the stats
[2:26:24] <%Axle13j> Axle13j subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! gottem lul
[2:26:24] <therealtacopancakes> but stamina use is huge
[2:26:36] <+jiggy_snipe> does Reggie have a club?
[2:26:36] <RyuuAoi> We'll be back!
[2:26:38] <redrins> it was draining about as much as a roll
[2:26:39] <andre11dr> But he's left with no stamina
[2:26:46] <%TrafficCohen> There's a Mace in 5-1
[2:26:48] <%Solidarity_> losing way less stamina with this shield now
[2:26:49] <%TrafficCohen> Early on
[2:26:54] <Pookiedaexzile> This is brutal
[2:26:59] <+jiggy_snipe> Reggie loves to fist
[2:27:01] <Pookiedaexzile> Parry Parenting at it's worst
[2:27:10] <MyNameIsRasus> Just put one more level in str and that shield will be sick
[2:27:12] <therealtacopancakes> Club chan is about to make an appearance
[2:27:15] <%Jetzord> @jiggy_snipe Reggie is a fisting artist
[2:27:16] <%ColonelTyphoon> amazing roll!
[2:27:17] <jorniev> cluuuub
[2:27:18] <+Exicuren> Huge difference, he took 2 hits and still got tons of stamina with the smaller shield
[2:27:19] <+saltpiggu> this is a hard part of the game but also one of my fav levels
[2:27:24] <%Cultist_Ryua> Its the best roll.
[2:27:25] <+Grayhammatter> amazing roll
[2:27:26] <%Dakuu75> that is NOT a bad roll
[2:27:26] <user_naim> Combat Caretaker
[2:27:28] <+JingKaisean> perfect roll
[2:27:34] <ronin19xx> Much more effective on this sheild
[2:27:36] <%ColonelTyphoon> I-frame stylin'
[2:27:36] <+Dannzzyy> This wouldn‚Äôt be a bad time to try out shield parrying.
[2:27:41] <ronin19xx> Shield*
[2:27:42] <Pookiedaexzile> His rolls are looking really good
[2:27:42] <+saltpiggu> (not) a bad roll
[2:27:49] <penitentpendant> Save grass, just sit
[2:27:54] <Silenos> Reggie is doing fine, managing the hate that this game instills into your heart
[2:27:58] <MyNameIsRasus> THESE ROLLS
[2:28:06] <%Axle13j> Nice
[2:28:08] <velgaduere> but what if I don't let it come back and just keep trying to swing tho lobosThink
[2:28:11] <Pookiedaexzile> If only he was using these rolls as his main form of defense
[2:28:12] <MyNameIsRasus> He can level up now
[2:28:18] <redrins> dont wanna risk a trade
[2:28:22] <ronin19xx> Just get that strength stat up for the knight shield
[2:28:24] <+jiggy_snipe> I feel like Reggie is a good roller for a newbie
[2:28:31] <+Checktrap> I think its at 4k now
[2:28:32] <ronin19xx> Then youre good to go
[2:28:37] <%ColonelTyphoon> Reggie has good reflexes on the roll yeah
[2:28:38] <+berserkscarlett> punish issues
[2:28:40] <MyNameIsRasus> Oh shit mb
[2:28:44] <%ChoculaUltra> his dodging is getting insanely good
[2:28:46] <+CreggaMonsta> yeah rolls are good
[2:29:04] <HamFamJam> why fists?
[2:29:04] <therealtacopancakes> first stream he was parrying like a god too
[2:29:15] <Pookiedaexzile> Good roll Reflects, perceptive on the enemy,
[2:29:16] <%ChoculaUltra> fists deal blunt damage. skeletons haaaate blunt damage
[2:29:28] <Pookiedaexzile> perfect skills for a counter rolling two hander
[2:29:28] <Silenos> Before there was getting over it with bennet foddy... there was demon souls MVGame
[2:29:28] <$thomassolorio> yeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeye lat episode gave me chills
[2:29:29] <+jiggy_snipe> yea his reflexes are good
[2:29:29] <+Dannzzyy> Imagine how his fist looks punching skeletons all day.
[2:29:30] <%BlueJoneleth> @HamFamJam Skeletons are weak to blunt damage
[2:29:31] <velgaduere> @therealtacopancakes it's per-enemy
[2:29:43] <%Jack8274> LOL
[2:30:03] <therealtacopancakes> @velgaduere sure but first time touching a souls game he did so many in a row, I couldn't do that lol

[2:33:05] <jaygee303> Why back
[2:33:06] <+Undenizen> @mechslayer71 i never played demons! IS it the easiest? it seems the jankiest.
[2:33:06] <+JingKaisean> the souls saga is not complete
[2:33:07] <%BlueJoneleth> Go to 5-1 and pick up the mace
[2:33:08] <jaygee303> Ffs
[2:33:09] <jorniev> YOU THOUGHT
[2:33:10] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Can't wait for Maneaters

[2:33:13] <majindusto> SAFE? THAT'S PRECIOUS
[2:33:14] <%jetjagger222> RUN AWAY, RUN AWAY
[2:33:17] <Zayasu> nah its not the easiest if its his first one
[2:33:19] <%Cultist_Ryua> Everything Reggie feels is just a part of the Souls pilgrimage.
[2:33:23] <deadbrainpl> Club should be 500 at the Dredgling Merchant in 1-2
[2:33:24] <%TrafficCohen> @mechslayer71 First time and Woolie sent him to a hard zone straight after 1-2
[2:33:26] <%Terrarp> BYT
[2:33:30] <%BlueJoneleth> Go to 5-1 there is one right at the start. :)
[2:33:38] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Club is 1500 from the Dregling merchant, who will be in 1-2 now.
[2:33:39] <+mechslayer71> @undenizen it‚Äôs the jankiest and most obtuse, but in terms of combat encounters, it is the easiest.
[2:33:42] <Johannen> Wait realy? 4-1 after 1-2?
[2:33:48] <ronin19xx> There you go
[2:33:49] <%SarcFa> I dunno, Demons is easy when you know the skills, but it's difficulty climbs a bit faster than the others so it isn't as good at teaching the basics

[2:34:06] <Silenos> hmm
[2:34:06] <santafer> Latria. Latria.Latria
[2:34:11] <penitentpendant> Yup! This is a Megaman Game.
[2:34:14] <andre11dr> I thought he had one

[2:34:16] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Stonefang!
[2:34:22] <huskarl_zap> no bully thomas NO BULLY
[2:34:27] <%TrafficCohen> @WoolieVersus 5-1
[2:34:30] <%Jack8274> There is one right at the start of 2-1
[2:34:34] <+Grayhammatter> no clubs, oof
[2:34:47] <velgaduere> I walked away for a couple, did they level strength?
[2:34:47] <Pookiedaexzile> Oooor
[2:34:56] <penitentpendant> @velgaduere Yup
[2:34:56] <%DiscoMatador> There is one at the start of 5 1
[2:34:58] <Johannen> Does not he sell the club at 1-1 also?
[2:34:58] <velgaduere> nice
[2:34:59] <therealtacopancakes> we tried clubchan
[2:35:03] <Silenos> meh... its not really needed
[2:35:04] <%Valask> Bretagne DansGame
[2:35:20] <+Grayhammatter> nice
[2:35:31] <velgaduere> not his back Reggie, his butthole
[2:35:36] <mgotacon> Comeback incoming
[2:35:37] <+Dannzzyy> I believe.
[2:35:38] <+askalta> lol doesnt the shield do blunt?
[2:35:41] <%cobalt_phoenix_> he's gettin angy
[2:35:41] <%dreadedcthulhu> REACTION TECH CHASING
[2:35:46] <PrideOfFiddles> Nice even dmg numbers thanks to that extra point in STR
[2:35:47] <mgotacon> That shield will help a lot
[2:35:50] <%Jack8274> And the range of weapon catching his rolls
[2:35:54] <Silenos> hmm that is a good question, does the shield do more?
[2:35:58] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Cant touch this!
[2:36:05] <LunarRemix> Blood in the eyes
[2:36:13] <+Grayhammatter> also doing slightly more damage with your fists as well
[2:36:16] <%A_German_spy> @Silenos It won't do more than the fist.
[2:36:22] <mgotacon> Less stamina lost on block, and he's doing more damage too since he upped STr
[2:36:30] <velgaduere> damn bro monkaS
[2:36:30] <therealtacopancakes> clean run
[2:36:33] <+askalta> @A_German_spy what about with enchant weapon?

[2:36:36] <+Grayhammatter> damn monkaS
[2:36:43] <%Axle13j> wooliePOYO wooliePOYO
[2:36:43] <%A_German_spy> @askalta Shields can't be buffed, sadly.
[2:36:44] <%dreadedcthulhu> this shield is MUCH better with the extra str
[2:36:47] <+askalta> darn
[2:36:53] <%cobalt_phoenix_> woolieKICKDAD woolieVS
[2:36:57] <%BisoromiBear> hayai
[2:36:57] <Silenos> @A_German_spy it's also a matter of how much stamina i guess. but at least we can use the shield to block properly now
[2:36:58] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Rollin boi
[2:37:19] <EpitaphTransmits> Is Reggie trying to One-Punch?
[2:37:22] <+Grayhammatter> that shield is putting in work
[2:37:31] <brian_peppers1> go and shit talk the katana skelly Reggie LUL
[2:37:32] <%Jack8274> Have you tried using the soul remains, they are the alluring skulls and work on these enemies
[2:37:34] <penitentpendant> Memory is go
[2:37:47] <%A_German_spy> @Silenos Yeah, that's the most important thing. TECHNICALLY Reggie could hold the shield in his right hand and two-hand it, but that'd require him to learn a totally new fighting style, which isn't really worth it at this point. One thing at a time, you know?
[2:37:48] <majindusto> HE ROLL 'N
[2:37:53] <Silenos> ooo
[2:38:00] <Silenos> close dodge there
[2:38:00] <%slimmixrp> Reggie's tenacity is beyond admirable
[2:38:04] <+reallybigrocks> So why is Reggie using his bare fist?
[2:38:06] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Basics first
[2:38:06] <+Grayhammatter> shotel PogChamp
[2:38:11] <%Jack8274> Pocket rocks!
[2:38:12] <mgotacon> Yeah exactly spy.
[2:38:12] <+chiazam> HOES IN MY AREA
[2:38:15] <jorniev> i think he is starting to break those imaginary walls
[2:38:17] <deadbrainpl> Fist > Sword for skellies
[2:38:19] <penitentpendant> @reallybigrocks It's the only Blunt Weapon he owns
[2:38:21] <%A_German_spy> @reallybigrocks The skeletons are weak against blunt damage from the fists.
[2:38:25] <%BlueJoneleth> @reallybigrocks skeletons are weak to fist cuz they do blunt damage
[2:38:26] <mgotacon> New moveset would probably f him up right now.
[2:38:29] <user_naim> Shotel, Mhotel, Holiday Inn
[2:38:30] <%Jack8274> He's starting to believe
[2:38:45] <%A_German_spy> @mgotacon It would, especially since you can't riposte with a shield as your weapon.
[2:38:51] <+reallybigrocks> I see, that's fucking hilarious
[2:38:55] <+saltpiggu> get that colorless with the talisman?
[2:38:57] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Fun fact, hitting the skeletons during their rolling animations counts as a counter hits, so it does extra dmg
[2:39:22] <Silenos> I case he wants that sweet range MVGame
[2:39:22] <+askalta> he has enough for the hammer thop
[2:39:26] <mgotacon> Spear would be good counter hit damage too
[2:39:28] <Solidnick18> keep god with you
[2:39:42] <penitentpendant> Shield 100% Block Arrows, oh yeah
[2:39:49] <VincentGraves> did Reggie choose to do this world?
[2:39:52] <Silenos> oh yea the double shield
[2:39:58] <penitentpendant> @VincentGraves Woolie suggested it
[2:40:09] <Silenos> nah i was more thinking single handing it
[2:40:11] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:40:36] <Silenos> this man needs glasses :D
[2:40:36] <Pookiedaexzile> Oh no Kiting isn't working

[2:40:47] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[2:40:55] <mgotacon> that dodge tho
[2:41:02] <GeoffGeofreed> I'm guessing Woolie suggested this place cause he is going for Dex build

[2:49:10] <+reallybigrocks> The amount of polish on this game keeps impressing me
[2:49:17] <andre11dr> Sticky white stuff required ahead
[2:49:18] <GeoffGeofreed> sticky white SLIME?! 0/10 Remake!
[2:49:23] <%Cultist_Ryua> Keep scrolling.
[2:49:27] <treasonodb> reggie my dude. go grind in front of tower night for all the grass youll need
[2:49:28] <%blastyoboots> not finished scrolling down?
[2:49:30] <Crashfan01> how's the skeleton wolrd going?
[2:49:37] <Silenos> actually you should see the stats of the leather shield for some builds, its not half bad.
[2:50:04] <%Jack8274> So your armor bonus only applies with armor in the slot, so never be naked
[2:50:04] <Pookiedaexzile> Don't Need Armor if you aint gonna get hit
[2:50:05] <+Grayhammatter> oof
[2:50:08] <penitentpendant> Fashion Souls
[2:50:12] <+Undenizen> ARE YOU A BARBARIAN?
[2:50:20] <%Indigo_Automaton> BAR BAR BAR
[2:50:27] <user_naim> Fashion Souls
[2:50:27] <%Jack8274> Its not about fashion, Armor scaling only applies to worn things, so being naked means no stat bonuses
[2:50:28] <%Irridium> don't get hit
[2:50:28] <Pookiedaexzile> YOU HEAR THAT
[2:50:35] <andre11dr> Basically just rags
[2:50:35] <%blastyoboots> I think having armor on instead of an empty slot reduces your damage even if it's 0? that might be Dark Souls 1 i'm thinking of though.
[2:50:37] <Ner234> Just don't get hit 4Head
[2:50:39] <%Cultist_Ryua> Leather set is a good weight for him.
[2:50:44] <Silenos> If you want to club liek hans.... you could do that
[2:50:45] <%Indigo_Automaton> Reggarth, what is best in life?
[2:50:46] <OldManDeckardCain> which is why you need to shave your balls so that nothing sticks out Kappa
[2:50:48] <%Jack8274> @blastyoboots You are super correct
[2:51:01] <%A_German_spy> @blastazoid00 That's the later games. It started in DS2.
[2:51:13] <notsoy> it seems like it would be better to wear multiple lighter pieces for defense, right?
[2:51:13] <%blastyoboots> buy some Big Grass
[2:51:16] <+reallybigrocks> Fashion is the most important defence
[2:51:17] <Pookiedaexzile> If you dropped that huge hunk of metal
[2:51:24] <KaiserMario> Buy grass, my dude...
[2:51:26] <penitentpendant> @Indigo_Automaton Fisting Skeletons, apparently
[2:51:32] <%SarcFa> Didn't the defense down massively for empty slots start in DS3?
[2:51:44] <%SarcFa> I remember empty slots not being TOO bad in dS2
[2:51:48] <Silenos> You wont use the leather shield, but you should check its stats for like another time
[2:52:04] <%Jack8274> @SarcFa They show it in the menus in Dark souls 3, but it's still there
[2:52:09] <mgotacon> {ants are lighter tho for the leather, means you could wear the gloves and helmet tho.
[2:52:12] <%A_German_spy> @SarcFa It was much more sever in DS3, yeah.
[2:52:20] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Not worth it at all
[2:52:21] <%A_German_spy> @SarcFa *severe
[2:52:21] <X2Eliah> Reggie needs no heals

[3:03:41] <Prevot> this some dumb ass bull shit
[3:03:45] <+JingKaisean> fuckin stupid
[3:03:49] <+0neReeler> better than reloading the level
[3:03:50] <Silenos> Yea its a hidden feature
[3:03:56] <X2Eliah> This is not even "jank" this is just plain BS
[3:03:57] <Johannen> Realy? They changed how storage works but left this as is?
[3:03:57] <Afrosamasenpai> It's fiiiiiiiiine
[3:03:59] <penitentpendant> By the power of CHEESE
[3:04:04] <fangovafang> Yooooo wtf lol
[3:04:06] <xdeathknightx> I remember when Pat taught Woolie this :D
[3:04:11] <andre11dr> They really should've updated this
[3:04:22] <%blastyoboots> tell him which things to drop
[3:04:23] <Silenos> No it was always like this :)
[3:04:26] <%TrafficCohen> It's insane this stayed i n
[3:04:28] <siamzero94> they fixed that in ds3, why is it still this way?
[3:04:29] <%Lion_kun> the nostalgia :,)
[3:04:32] <ronin19xx> LUL
[3:04:42] <%Jetzord> oh kinda like Cyber Sleuth on the switch. Leave in sleep mode, go to work come back to max levels
[3:04:42] <%Lion_kun> they fixed it in ds2
[3:04:44] <Obake_Radio> good times lol
[3:04:52] <andre11dr> It only took the 3 games to make it better
[3:04:53] <Johannen> Do we have 100% they didnt change it?
[3:04:56] <+QueequegTheater> Can you feel the jank
[3:04:57] <ronin19xx> Man
[3:04:57] <%ZweihanderSteve> its the best shut up though
[3:05:02] <+Exicuren> @siamzero94 because Blue Point sometimes is a bit too purist
[3:05:05] <Silenos> this is one of the features they left in, cause its closely related to the spirit of the game. Another such thing, would be the starting gift the ammulet.
[3:05:12] <%Indigo_Automaton> Teach the Birbs about JEbus
[3:05:12] <MyNameIsRasus> Does it janken up your day
[3:05:21] <+QueequegTheater> He can do it
[3:05:25] <+QueequegTheater> I believe in you

[3:06:56] <%A_German_spy> You've got Photo Mode now, though, so the Telescope is more or less obsolete

[3:13:03] <hadokenforyou> now u know
[3:13:06] <majindusto> Oof
[3:13:07] <Pookiedaexzile> ANd use it two handed
[3:13:08] <Wessuri> hell yeah, uchi

[3:13:16] <EpitaphTransmits> @Matermind0 Oh wait you're right lol
[3:13:18] <majindusto> Poor Reggie
[3:13:20] <Zayasu> HahaDoge
[3:13:20] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus In the Remake, they changed Crystal Lizards so that you no longer lose the spawn if they escape. It'll be back next time you reset the zone. You still lose it if it runs off a cliff and dies, though. Its drops still don't teleport into your inventory like in the later games.
[3:13:23] <+vaderxyz1970> Overconfidence is a slow and icidious killer
[3:13:24] <+saltpiggu> just pop some souls and level up
[3:13:33] <penitentpendant> Honest mistake
[3:13:42] <ronin19xx> That was actually pretty dumb by the game
[3:13:42] <Wessuri> @A_German_spy omg I didn't know this
[3:13:43] <VincentGraves> I hate how much strength you need for the katanas
[3:13:45] <+0neReeler> quirk from original game?
[3:13:48] <user_naim> It gets you
[3:14:02] <%SainEdge> reminds me of the DS1 LP, when Pat told Wollie to jump in the hole in firelink shrine...and then wollie died LUL
[3:14:04] <Wessuri> I've been panicking with every lizard encounter like the old days
[3:14:13] <%A_German_spy> @Wessuri Yeah, they didn't mention it anywhere in the game.
[3:14:13] <+BoltWarden> that's not overconfidence, it's a logical, but unexpected change
[3:14:14] <andre11dr> Even though it looks like 2020 ,it has the soul of 2009
[3:14:15] <EpitaphTransmits> @VincentGraves You need the power of god and anime to wield such weebery
[3:14:27] <Pookiedaexzile> Or just two hand
[3:14:30] <Pookiedaexzile> Yes
[3:14:36] <ronin19xx> @SainEdge Followed by "Uhhh..nnn...uuummm"
[3:14:48] <fangovafang> Orochi style lol
[3:14:53] <Pookiedaexzile> Take the sheild off
[3:14:57] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus This weapon has an insane sprinting attack
[3:15:00] <+0neReeler> waiting for a souls where charged attack is vergil rapid slash
[3:15:03] <%superc37> oof still fat rollin with the shield
[3:15:04] <GeoffGeofreed> I would prefer blue point to fix certain quirks of this game but whatever
[3:15:05] <Wessuri> the running attack is my favorite
[3:15:05] <%Seancicle> ? permission to approach the well
[3:15:06] <ronin19xx> @andre11dr Yup, unedited A.I and mechanics
[3:15:07] <andre11dr> KEEP THAT SHOVE IN MIND

[3:15:46] <Pookiedaexzile> and he did it while two handing
[3:15:47] <mgotacon> Sprint r1 is great for footsies in pvp.

[3:29:53] <+jiggy_snipe> and patience is necessary when you are learning Souls
[3:29:54] <@Solidus_113> or, medium kick
[3:30:04] <penitentpendant> Overimpatience is a quick and obvious killer
[3:30:14] <majindusto> Getting Greedy
[3:30:23] <+anoldtoilet> if anything hes too patient. he keeps waiting after his block and the skelly recoils instead of going in
[3:30:32] <+anoldtoilet> reggie leaving a LOT of openings
[3:30:40] <brunoberserk> desire is cooler than greedy
[3:30:43] <%SarcFa> He's doing both honestly

[3:30:43] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[3:30:57] <%SarcFa> he's going in super hard sometimes, and other times hanging back super hard

[3:38:56] <velgaduere> @wicketpelican Reggie asked a question, so Woolie answered lobosShrug
[3:39:12] <user_naim> @trafficcohen so is the Alonne Knight mob
[3:39:17] <brunoberserk> legolas build ?
[3:39:17] <%Jack8274> The whole point is you DONT pull multiple with theif since the aggro range is decrease
[3:39:24] <ManlyMcBeefington> chat any boss fights this stream so far?
[3:39:30] <mgotacon> Repalce the sword sure
[3:39:35] <Zayasu> no
[3:39:36] <+Undenizen> You know, it's been so long since I've seen someone truly have to come to terms with what the souls games do. it's wonderful.
[3:39:37] <mgotacon> Replace*
[3:39:39] <%Jack8274> Grab the leather set
[3:39:44] <%Jetzord> @ManlyMcBeefington nope
[3:39:55] <ManlyMcBeefington> @jetzord thanks
[3:40:39] <ronin19xx> !uptime
[3:40:40] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 50 minutes
[3:40:43] <+reallybigrocks> Is the weight on ammo per item or for the whole stack?
[3:40:50] <Pookiedaexzile> We finna go thru every weapon in the game before he two hands once
[3:40:50] <+0neReeler> haptics
[3:40:54] <ronin19xx> H A P T I C
[3:41:04] <andre11dr> Maybe not with headshots
[3:41:07] <%TrafficCohen> Yeah, Iron Keep's enemies are stupidly balanced but walking theough it doesn't hurt my soul like Shrine of Amana
[3:41:14] <mgotacon> Yeah that damage itsn't worth it actually.
[3:41:26] <+0neReeler> big whiff
[3:41:28] <penitentpendant> Too high
[3:41:30] <+PulleylubeTW> the height difference lol
[3:41:31] <ronin19xx> HITBOXESSSSSSS
[3:41:34] <mgotacon> Staircase bs lol
[3:41:36] <KaiserMario> It's the lean
[3:41:37] <+anoldtoilet> punches have shitty range and he leaned back
[3:41:40] <+cvp5127> the high ground
[3:41:40] <+Grayhammatter> staircases
[3:41:47] <+anoldtoilet> he did the rocaway
[3:41:54] <ronin19xx> Gitboxporn
[3:41:56] <Hammatime8> Killed him with your bare hands! LUL
[3:41:58] <+askalta> cant he get a hammer now that he has the str for the shield?
[3:42:00] <ronin19xx> Got*
[3:42:04] <mgotacon> Get some in 2-1
[3:42:04] <ronin19xx> Hit*
[3:42:05] <user_naim> @TrafficCohen Different strokes i guess
[3:42:08] <resloxxx> FeelsBadMan
[3:42:10] <Josef_Stryker> They're only really good in DS2
[3:42:12] <Blank9> in 2 they are the most viable
[3:42:12] <mgotacon> The Iron Knucles
[3:42:14] <penitentpendant> New Game Punch
[3:42:15] <ronin19xx> 2-2
[3:42:15] <andre11dr> WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
[3:42:19] <+Grayhammatter> FeelsBadMan
[3:42:24] <mgotacon> Is it 2-2?
[3:42:26] <+PulleylubeTW> dark souls 2 vanilla had the champions ring, that made fists really good until it got nerfed
[3:42:27] <+anoldtoilet> 3 has some sick ass punch weaps and the caestus is really strong
[3:42:28] <@Solidus_113> Bone Fist
[3:42:28] <ronin19xx> Yup
[3:42:30] <Josef_Stryker> Hell in DS2, there's a ring where u can fight with your bare hands
[3:42:30] <%Javaa01> Bonefist in DS2 is really the best you got, and that thing is still raw to use
[3:42:32] <mgotacon> It's after the first short cut.
[3:42:37] <+anoldtoilet> demon fists and cestus ftw
[3:42:41] <ronin19xx> bfore flame boy
[3:42:43] <mgotacon> I suppose you need to clear 2-2 to get it.
[3:42:45] <user_naim> Caestus in DS3 stunlocks everything
[3:42:47] <%Klefth> Bone Fist is the best weapon in the entire fucking series.
[3:42:47] <penitentpendant> Punish that roll spam
[3:42:50] <andre11dr> Someone needs to learn about Light Weapon Iron Knuckle infinite headbutta to death
[3:42:51] <%wydamn> Punch builds are decent, but punch-only builds are difficult
[3:42:51] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Why should it be better? Its just another weapon
[3:42:56] <Iwashi94> wait so why is reggie going barehanded?
[3:42:57] <+anoldtoilet> cestus in the parry hand in ds3 and another cestus in the attack hand fucks people up in pvp
[3:42:59] <+Grayhammatter> punching that skeleton in the dick
[3:43:01] <+0neReeler> fist is coolest in this just from new animations
[3:43:05] <user_naim> Not good for bosses though
[3:43:08] <+Exicuren> DS2 Bonefist you do a Hadouken, like wtf, Woolie?
[3:43:09] <%Javaa01> @Iwashi94 It's his best source of blunt damage
[3:43:14] <KaiserMario> You say that, but then Reggie destroys these guys like they're nothing...
[3:43:16] <VincentGraves> fists do more damage than swords to skeletons
[3:43:16] <Iwashi94> ahh ty
[3:43:23] <%TrafficCohen> Yeah Woolie, This is an L
[3:43:23] <Johannen> Soul Remains?
[3:43:24] <%Klefth> The Bone Fist in DS2 and the Demon Fists in DS3 are totally fucking viable, though
[3:43:34] <user_naim> But the weapon art lets you tank even the Skeleton Balls
[3:43:35] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:43:36] <Monkeyweed21> BONEWHEELS
[3:43:38] <andre11dr> Punching is probably the most op in this game because the headbutt glit3
[3:43:41] <Pookiedaexzile> Two is availible
[3:43:41] <Blank9> dual caestus in 2 is also great
[3:43:43] <velgaduere> why did you give chase tho
[3:43:43] <ronin19xx> PHEW BOYS
[3:43:44] <peachy996> You panicked
[3:43:46] <+liquidzr0> ShoopDaWhoop
[3:43:46] <andre11dr> glitch*
[3:43:50] <redrins> cant turn your back and expect to block just cause you got your shield up
[3:43:54] <+anoldtoilet> yeah, demon fists are great and have a full moveset, caestus are incredible in ds3 too for the poise weapon art they have
[3:43:55] <+Grayhammatter> the panic
[3:43:58] <Pookiedaexzile> God why
[3:44:03] <velgaduere> might wanna get those souls first tho
[3:44:08] <+0neReeler> surprised he hasn't yet
[3:44:13] <ronin19xx> Alright were commiting to 4 at this rate
[3:44:30] <ronin19xx> I hope we leave 4 after this boss
[3:44:50] <$SilverRoddo> These skele-mans has the environmental advantage. Much too powerful.
[3:44:55] <%Double_Tap_That> Double_Tap_That subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months!
[3:45:02] <VincentGraves> you don't want Reggie doing 4-2? I think it would be hilarious
[3:45:23] <%TrafficCohen> I would have recommended leaving World 4 after getting the Crescent Falchion
[3:45:23] <+0neReeler> when your sword bounces off the wall but not enemies'
[3:45:25] <penitentpendant> "As long as it works."
[3:45:27] <ronin19xx> Oh funsies runs sure
[3:45:38] <andre11dr> Oh God chat, we haven't even gotten to the golden boys yet, that's gonna be ROUGH
[3:45:41] <ronin19xx> Not full commitments to 4
[3:46:06] <velgaduere> HahaThink

[3:46:20] <user_naim> @trafficcohen uhh didn‚Äôt we get that already
[3:46:21] <$SilverRoddo> Their dodges animations remind me of that one Naroodo game.
[3:46:22] <ronin19xx> @andre11dr Hes boing introduced to some mechanics slowly but surely

[3:50:08] <+0neReeler> alot of people quit this game on ps3
[3:50:15] <%p4ntless> this is especially normal for your first souls game ever
[3:50:16] <%JustYudha> JustYudha subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! Hey Woolie, have you played anything on your fancy new computer yet? Hope you haven't been too busy with the channel stuff that you haven't played with your new toys. Also Gee Gee on Demon Souls Reggie!

[4:06:53] <+PulleylubeTW> you can stack like 4 regen effects at once
[4:06:53] <%linSP> Infinite heal
[4:06:57] <%Pillagius> Wolverine Build!!!
[4:06:58] <+0neReeler> what i've never done that
[4:06:59] <andre11dr> So this shield +Scraping Spear is my pvp setup and it pure scumbag material and i love it
[4:07:01] <ronin19xx> Oh man

[4:07:25] <penitentpendant> "What poison?" Says man in swamp.
[4:07:27] <dinnydanny777> Or you can be brave and go naked :(
[4:07:30] <Pookiedaexzile> TWO HAND
[4:07:31] <%krispen_wa> Time for standing still for 10 min for regen streams
[4:07:35] <+anoldtoilet> the shield is pretty good!
[4:07:39] <+0neReeler> zweihander mains
[4:07:44] <+anoldtoilet> its stable and 90 percent damage reductions fine
[4:07:54] <%SarcFa> Ultimate HP regen bs build, +5 adjucator's, blessed +5 weapon, and regen ring
[4:08:01] <Monkeyweed21> is Reggie gonna go for the Uchi?
[4:08:11] <Pookiedaexzile> KEEP DAT THANG ON YOU
[4:08:21] <+zzNamttamzz> take a spear
[4:08:27] <KaiserMario> I think as long as Reggie doesn't go full +5 regen combo, it's not broken and it's pretty fair
[4:08:29] <redrins> you could unequip cling and equip it again to see it but eeeeeh
[4:08:32] <notsoy> it means you DON'T have to heal after fighting, save it for DURING fighting
[4:08:33] <ronin19xx> Franky just dying of old age there
[4:08:34] <+0neReeler> no grass farming
[4:08:38] <+NanoComputer> @SarcFa My exact build with a the mid hammer.
[4:08:39] <+eanscrale> Nah you can get some CRAZY regen
[4:08:53] <%Javaa01> And you might even have a build

[4:09:29] <@Solidus_113> 90% is still good
[4:09:30] <Pookiedaexzile> Put it on
[4:09:37] <penitentpendant> It's lighter too
[4:09:38] <+Grayhammatter> 90% is good
[4:09:50] <KaiserMario> You can equip more armor too
[4:09:58] <notsoy> i bet the healing items saved from carrying regen items must be WILD
[4:10:01] <+anoldtoilet> that looks PRO
[4:10:01] <penitentpendant> Paladin Build is go
[4:10:02] <+Grayhammatter> can equip more armor too
[4:10:02] <+eanscrale> it's the shield used by the game's famous mascot.

[4:10:28] <Monkeyweed21> could put on some gloves
[4:10:32] <mr_red117> this is THE BUILD
[4:10:33] <KaiserMario> Get those gloves on too
[4:10:34] <dundore77> 4-1 is also a good grinding spot once you know how to handle the skeletons

[4:46:15] <mgotacon> @Blank9 He has a ton of bladestone from all those runs too.
[4:46:17] <+Higure_yoru> 30 i think
[4:46:22] <%A_German_spy> @RyuuAoi Not for quality, no
[4:46:23] <Monkeyweed21> quality build is really good for 1st time
[4:46:28] <+megaman_sentinel> yes go quality
[4:46:28] <+Graxe_> Upgrading the Adjudicator's Shield does increase its regen rate, though. Like 8 HP/second at +5.
[4:46:44] <goose_coward> a chance to prove his quality
[4:46:48] <+Graxe_> But that's all using colorless demon souls

[4:47:08] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> *it
[4:47:19] <%Indigo_Automaton> DS3 Quality meta is busted
[4:47:36] <Pookiedaexzile> Reggie you can't have everything
[4:47:39] <+0neReeler> minmax
[4:47:42] <dundore77> you can get just get to 20 str which lets you equip most things and then just bump the dex for scaling
[4:47:48] <VincentGraves> just let Reggie get the dragonbone sword and destroy everything
[4:47:58] <+paladinstarbuster> LET HIM DO MAGIC
[4:48:01] <BearSawed> @Indigo_Automaton they buffed the other infusions, its pretty balanced now
[4:48:05] <notsoy> the crescent falchion makes his spell useless right now
[4:48:06] <Monkeyweed21> endurance and vitality are always good
[4:48:06] <dundore77> bump*
[4:48:16] <+0neReeler> magic + that sword
[4:48:19] <Pookiedaexzile> Shoot shit, hit harder
[4:48:28] <Pookiedaexzile> That is magic
[4:48:36] <RyuuAoi> Reggie not using magic heavy rn.
[4:48:37] <penitentpendant> When in doubt more VIT
[4:48:51] <Monkeyweed21> yea pretty much
[4:48:53] <Pookiedaexzile> YOU CAN NOT DO EVERYTHING
[4:48:57] <dinnydanny777> Miracles into Mistakes
[4:49:04] <%BlueJoneleth> sword cales with magic
[4:49:07] <%BlueJoneleth> scales
[4:49:13] <+TheotherKristian> It's time to kick bubble amd chew ass, and I'm all out of ass
[4:49:13] <notsoy> the crescent falchion scales with magic right now
[4:49:19] <dundore77> you can do everything it just gets harder to level up if you want to
[4:49:20] <$JobbedBone> pick two things. Health and stamina count
[4:49:26] <MyNameIsRasus> Yeah, Falchion scales with magic also
[4:49:36] <+jiggy_snipe> more health and stamina is always good
[4:49:41] <Blank9> he could go magic now and make himself a magic uchigatana later
[4:49:46] <VincentGraves> he's not gonna stick with the crescent falchion forever, it's only used early game
[4:50:03] <+Mr_Misanthropy> I always play some caster or dex kinda character. SO when I started my first serious souls experience when this came to ps5 I am going a str build. It's been fun so far
[4:50:04] <dinnydanny777> The magic stat just being called Magic is funny to me for some reason
[4:50:05] <sendart> if he aint gonna use the uchi no point in getting str
[4:50:05] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus The question is, are you gonna use the Crescent Falchion for the whole game? And invest in a weapon you might ditch later?
[4:50:28] <Pookiedaexzile> STRENTGH IS NOT ATTACK POWER
[4:50:30] <andre11dr> But if you switch to Uchi you can totally run around with a buffet uchi
[4:50:38] <+anoldtoilet> but a weapon that doesnt have magic is able to be buffed with magic weapon
[4:50:41] <RyuuAoi> USE IT
[4:50:46] <+anoldtoilet> and magic stat makes magic weapon better
[4:50:49] <VincentGraves> the thing with the uchi is that it scales with dex, but needs so much str
[4:50:49] <+0neReeler> str build it is
[4:50:52] <dundore77> they can also upgrade a weapon to magic
[4:50:54] <%psidefx> Reggie the Spellsword
[4:51:13] <BearSawed> uchi Buffet? like a bar of all you can eat swords?
[4:51:23] <Blank9> he should buy flame toss
[4:51:29] <dinnydanny777> There should be a magic that let's you shoot swords at people
[4:51:33] <Blank9> so he can toss out something for fun
[4:51:55] <Pookiedaexzile> DEX
[4:51:56] <$BallerSwagBro9k> He beat big boi?
[4:52:04] <mgotacon> Yeah he did
[4:52:08] <+paladinstarbuster> he did
[4:52:08] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Pog
[4:52:16] <Pookiedaexzile> dex if you're gonna do the uchi
[4:52:19] <+chiazam> uh huh
[4:52:34] <+brightman42> dump stat is the stat you ignore
[4:52:43] <+Mrbaconator> ye that isn't what dump stat means
[4:52:51] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> it's not
[4:52:58] <Pookiedaexzile> That's your Pump Stat not your Dump stat
[4:52:59] <+brightman42> in this case it'd be faith and luck
[4:53:03] <VincentGraves> just use all of em
[4:53:12] <+anoldtoilet> its not enjough
[4:53:17] <brunoberserk> dont forget to buy grass
[4:53:25] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> who needs grass?

[4:57:21] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> That was a good session of Bugsnax
[4:57:33] <RyuuAoi> Play Tetris now!!
[4:57:38] <mgotacon> All those dex weapons though.
[4:57:44] <andre11dr> @raziwraith Well they still should do Old Monk the right way
[4:57:45] <dmtjinni> Game Over Yeeaaaaah
[4:57:48] <+Graxe_> Bugsnax
[4:57:51] <penitentpendant> Hard Level, Easy Boss
[4:58:00] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus That is ABSOLUTELY normal. 100% within expected parameters.
[4:58:02] <+askalta> woolie i know you ust got off dmcv vergil but the fist sucks. just let reggie buy a blunt weapon
[4:58:13] <VincentGraves> most people go to the next archstone, not skip a couple of em
[4:58:14] <RyuuAoi> We're still here, Woolie! We down with the pound!
[4:58:16] <+Graxe_> 4-1 can take so much longer
[4:58:26] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus You made the right calls.
[4:58:29] <+Graxe_> Especially if you go after Vanguard
[4:58:32] <ronin19xx> He should understand that stages are more difficult than bosses, reoccurring in souls
[4:58:56] <RyuuAoi> Today was a BIG day! Lessons learned.
[4:58:58] <+zzNamttamzz> The golsd skeleton fights were so hype
[4:59:00] <penitentpendant> It's downhill from here, Regen helps mitigate grass needs
[4:59:03] <Tempmael> the rest of these zones will be a breeze with the lessons learned today
[4:59:06] <andre11dr> Im really hype for 3 and 5
[4:59:09] <jorniev> TOWER OF LATRIA IS GONNABE AWESOME

[4:59:33] <%p4ntless> reggie's gonna be a fucking killer
[4:59:34] <redrins> oh man neither of them have a sense of direction, latria is really gonna be fun
[4:59:37] <Pookiedaexzile> Yeah you could do that
[4:59:37] <%Puhff> fail
[4:59:39] <ronin19xx> Dude, that detour from the shield explanation LUL
[4:59:39] <Pookiedaexzile> and you would have won
[4:59:42] <VincentGraves> you don't need to backtrack if you have a good weapon
[4:59:43] <+Higure_yoru> the best weapon in demons souls is confidence
[4:59:43] <Pookiedaexzile> if you you two hand
[4:59:44] <andre11dr> 3 is gonna be fucking fun
[4:59:44] <RyuuAoi> @woolieversus Force Reggie to stay at your house tonight and grind. No progress!
[4:59:53] <%Jetzord> This ain't Yakuza, numbers are bad
[5:00:04] <ronin19xx> @andre11dr Bro 5 is gonna be a mess too
[5:00:08] <dan_g_v> gang time
[5:00:12] <VincentGraves> really pained me to see Reggie fight enemies with his fist
[5:00:17] <OblivionSword1> Respect the game
[5:00:33] <dmtjinni> Next: ReggieVS DaS, ReggieVS DaS II, ReggieVS DaS III, ReggieVS BB. Please Woolie @WoolieVersus
[5:00:34] <penitentpendant> Rush Forward, trigger Ancestor Quotes
[5:00:56] <%A_German_spy> @VincentGraves The fist was quite literally the smartest strategy against the Skeletons
[5:01:00] <RyuuAoi> Take it slow, Reggie. Every time. Every time. EVERY TIME.
[5:01:03] <%MrPedrovsky> MercyWing1 psaCrazyhead MercyWing2
[5:01:07] <%baka_sugoi> DON"T TELL ME NOT TO MASH
[5:01:21] <+jiggy_snipe> Reggie didn't have another blunt weapon so fists was best
[5:01:21] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[5:01:22] <VincentGraves> @A_German_spy no, that would've been buying a club from 1-2
[5:01:29] <ronin19xx> Ooooo I wonder if Woolz is gonna make Reg "Beat" the boss of 3-1
[5:01:43] <+OK__Gamer> he hasn't been to 2 yet
[5:01:50] <RyuuAoi> Learn the enemy. THEN GO IN.
[5:01:55] <%A_German_spy> @VincentGraves Going to 1-2 would have been a waste of time. The Club isn't meaningfully better for 4-1 than a bare fist.
[5:01:59] <%p4ntless> parrying comes with time
[5:02:01] <+sweetvillain> am I just catching the end
[5:02:02] <%MrPedrovsky> @ronin19xx Probably just one time to hear the dialogue
[5:02:04] <+OK__Gamer> let him lean as he goes
[5:02:09] <+jiggy_snipe> Endgame Reggie is gonna be a parry rolling god, watch
[5:02:17] <%krispen_wa> THE PARRY AGENDA
[5:02:25] <ronin19xx> @MrPedrovsky True, for lesson learning too
[5:02:25] <+jiggy_snipe> Ultra Instinct Reggie incoming
[5:02:33] <+askalta> aw ywah
[5:02:33] <Pookiedaexzile> PARRY Parent
[5:02:52] <VincentGraves> @A_German_spy but it has better range than the fist, Reggie was missing a lot
[5:03:14] <OblivionSword1> the dreglings in 1-1 are a pretty good parry practice
[5:03:15] <RyuuAoi> Live and learn
[5:03:20] <%MrPedrovsky> So who wanna bet the 3-1 is next Kappa
[5:03:23] <%A_German_spy> @VincentGraves All the more opportunity for Reggie to learn spacing... which he accomplished remarkably well by the time all was said and done.
[5:03:27] <ronin19xx> Parry that mic
[5:03:53] <+Jaysky> Depends
[5:03:56] <Equirah> not all but yes
[5:04:00] <%ozzrabbit> not in Demons
[5:04:01] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Nope.
[5:04:08] <%MrPedrovsky> No
[5:04:10] <+ymmv> In future games
[5:04:14] <+ymmv> Not this one
[5:04:16] <%Seancicle> I don't know
[5:04:16] <OblivionSword1> not in demon i think
[5:04:17] <%p4ntless> No, but you can later!
[5:04:27] <%Indigo_Automaton> Unless you're playing Sekiro
[5:04:28] <+P1nkHat> in 3-3 kinda
[5:04:33] <RyuuAoi> Keep rollin!
[5:04:35] <+Grayhammatter> two hand glorious nippon steel
[5:04:37] <OblivionSword1> in DS a handful can be parried
[5:04:40] <+ymmv> Or Bloodborne!
[5:04:49] <+ymmv> BB almost everything can be parried
[5:04:50] <+jiggy_snipe> if you aren't blocking drop your shield
[5:04:50] <Johannen> You can parry enemeis of your height/+1 head height
[5:05:00] <andre11dr> Well actually you can parry one boss
[5:05:06] <%krispen_wa> DROP YOUR SHIELD
[5:05:07] <RyuuAoi> You can roll jobbers to, Reggie. It comes with time!
[5:05:09] <andre11dr> 5-3
[5:05:13] <amritadyne> drop your shield woolie
[5:05:13] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> good times
[5:05:14] <+jiggy_snipe> especially Reggie has good reflexes for dodging
[5:05:21] <+askalta> i see what you are4 doing now woolz
[5:05:22] <+jiggy_snipe> like he has split second dodges alot
[5:05:22] <%p4ntless> blocking is a tool, just like parrying and rolling
[5:05:26] <%MrPedrovsky> D R O P. D A. S H I E L D.
[5:05:32] <%p4ntless> sometimes it's the right tool and sometimes it's not
[5:05:38] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> now I kinda wanna rewatch the ds1 lp
[5:05:54] <%MrPedrovsky> @kosorsomesaykosm_ Rewatching the comp of it now Lol

[5:06:55] <%MrPedrovsky> Leave Jiren to Reggie
[5:07:00] <+paladinstarbuster> I remember when wooile did that home training for command mission and pulled a pat so I do believe LP tax hurts him the most
[5:07:35] <%A_German_spy> @paladinstarbuster The LP tax hurts everyone. It doesn't discriminate.
[5:08:08] <OblivionSword1> does it hurts you as well @A_German_spy ?

[5:20:40] <%MrPedrovsky> [3-1 WAITING ROOM]
[5:20:40] <+PulleylubeTW> 5 hour boss fight
[5:20:45] <OblivionSword1> that boss was rough
[5:20:48] <townzzzzz> LUL
[5:20:52] <a_goth_pancake> i'm hearing something about three zones in three sessions, so that's exciting
[5:21:00] <+Nobrev> fume is fuckin rough
[5:21:04] <%A_German_spy> I've had to do this too, more than a few times
[5:21:04] <+wicketpelican> Fume Knight?
[5:21:12] <%ColonelTyphoon> The one and only
[5:21:14] <andre11dr> I spent like 3 days on NG+5 Ludwig
[5:21:17] <Crashfan01> hollowoolie
[5:21:18] <jorniev> REGGIE VS FUME KNIGHT
[5:21:23] <%Chatterbox1991> what is he talking about?
[5:21:24] <%Reverend_Roscoe> fume knight
[5:21:25] <a_goth_pancake> I'm pretty sure I stopped on e I hit fume and never went back
[5:21:25] <$BallerSwagBro9k> HOLLOW
[5:21:28] <Tempmael> mr snip snip is sometimes necessary
[5:21:30] <%wydamn> hollowing more and more, in-game and emotionally
[5:21:32] <%Chatterbox1991> Artorias?
[5:21:40] <@Solidus_113> chatter...
[5:21:40] <glass_marcus> Fume Knight is a fucker
[5:21:42] <%A_German_spy> @Chatterbox1991 Fume Knight in DS2
[5:21:42] <%SarcFa> I think Fume
[5:21:43] <rkbinder> fume knight
[5:21:43] <%BlueJoneleth> no he said DS2
[5:21:49] <T_Sasquatch> Gascoigne made me quit bloodborne for 2 years
[5:21:52] <emeraldskrull> oh god that was more than 6 years ago. I'm so old.
[5:21:52] <+wicketpelican> What boss it is? Fume Knight? Say the name woolie
[5:21:54] <andre11dr> Ludwig is the one for me
[5:21:54] <supergoblinpunch> You need to learn his dance
[5:21:59] <+askalta> FUGS for life
[5:21:59] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Ah yes VAPE KNIGHT
[5:22:00] <+wicketpelican> Oh ok
[5:22:01] <Matt_Cowdery> oh shit I just got back, and we're talking fume knight
[5:22:04] <T_Sasquatch> ironically i one shot fume knight LUL
[5:22:06] <%BisoromiBear> Fume fucked me up too
[5:22:13] <jorniev> VAPE KNIGHT LUL
[5:22:15] <+branlomanche> he's my worst one still
[5:22:16] <ronin19xx> LUL
[5:22:23] <+Mitchellsocks> Raime? More like I‚Äôm in Pain
[5:22:26] <Crashfan01> this shit was Orphan of Kos for me
[5:22:28] <+matteasy31> Me with Orphan of Kos and Ishiin
[5:22:30] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus If you went back, I'm sure you could do it in sub 10 tries easy, cause once you know how to do it, you just do it!
[5:22:33] <jorniev> THE OVERHEAD TRACKS!
[5:22:35] <%hax_metatron> For me that was Orphan of Kos, and Isshin. Woolie would love Isshin :(
[5:22:37] <%ozzrabbit> Fucking Raime, that oversized son-of-a-######
[5:22:40] <andre11dr> I think i spent more time on Sin than on Fume ironically
[5:22:43] <+ymmv> Is Fume Knight a DLC guy? I legit do not remember this guy from multiple DS2 playthroughs
[5:22:45] <+Nobrev> get to that tunnel vision state and the only thing left is you and the boss
[5:22:50] <%jepupu> Fighting Ebrietas on a dex build cane whip took me several days. Nothing in Soulsbornes has been as tough for me.
[5:22:52] <glass_marcus> Me and sister freide hung out for 3 hours one day
[5:22:52] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1346351996379521026
[5:23:01] <velgaduere> ultra GS
[5:23:03] <+paladinstarbuster> raimememes
[5:23:04] <%SarcFa> ultra great sword
[5:23:08] <+Grayhammatter> Fume knight is in one of the DLCs for DS2
[5:23:08] <%A_German_spy> @ymmv Iron King DLC, yes
[5:23:10] <%MrPedrovsky> Amelia had me at 37 tries and Kos had me at 4
[5:23:10] <andre11dr> @ymmv yes ,he's DLC
[5:23:11] <+jiggy_snipe> also for Reggie, it's not the bosses, it's the levels
[5:23:16] <jorniev> THIS GAME HAS THE P WORD
[5:23:17] <+Mitchellsocks> @jepupu just do what i‚Äôve accidentally done multiple times and clip inside her lol
[5:23:20] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @glass_marcus Use DragonSlayer Axe staggers her nonstop
[5:23:30] <@Solidus_113> Ivory King
[5:23:34] <+Grayhammatter> sir alonne is so cool
[5:23:39] <%krispen_wa> i always found ser allone way harder. probably because of the boss run
[5:23:39] <RyuuAoi> While we were gaming, Atlus released Persona OSTs on Spotify. They blowing it up rn. Go listen to some good music!
[5:23:40] <+ymmv> God yeah the DLCs were a nightmare
[5:23:43] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[5:23:43] <andre11dr> He's the first multi faze Boss
[5:23:45] <+ymmv> Once and done and never went back
[5:23:48] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Run to Alone is the bad part
[5:24:01] <@Solidus_113> it is
[5:24:03] <+TheotherKristian> *Hopefully it won't take them 3 years
[5:24:08] <CrimsonGargoyle> @BallerSwagBro9k you can say that twice
[5:24:14] <@Solidus_113> DFOD is better
[5:24:19] <%BlueJoneleth> For the records, I beat Dark Souls in a month after struggling for 3 years in demons lol.
[5:24:22] <2sappy> 1-4 is gonna be a fun watch when Reggie gets there
[5:24:22] <@Solidus_113> or DFD
[5:24:24] <glass_marcus> @BallerSwagBro9k I mean I already beat her, but if i play through dlc again i'll remember taht
[5:24:51] <%zanderwitch42> every time I hear DNF I think Did Not Finish
[5:24:52] <+Nobrev> I miss pre SotFS DS2. SotFS is such a worse version of the game. the PS3/360 version of SotFS is the only decent one because it doesn't have all the bullshit changes
[5:24:52] <%alyss988> PogChamp
[5:24:55] <@Solidus_113> Half Life 2 still coming
