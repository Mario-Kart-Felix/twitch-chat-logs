[0:07:16] <terrorengine> cold blooded
[0:07:20] <Jaysky> I just think of the League champ
[0:07:21] <%X2Eliah> HES NOT WRONG
[0:07:21] <%justcallmebobplease> Woolie what the fuck
[0:07:26] <Blank9> but what it pat was the darlington
[0:07:28] <$dudedude55555> SIZE DISCRIMINATION
[0:07:33] <iacus_> I mean he's not wrong, but harsh!
[0:07:43] <aiutare47> Lucian is a vampire name
[0:07:46] <AnneSQF> What are some good orb names?
[0:07:47] <spaceitaly> If Pat was named Lucien maybe he would have been tall
[0:07:53] <%X2Eliah> @aiutare47 right
[0:08:02] <%X2Eliah> @AnneSQF bob
[0:08:17] <+yukichocomilk> @spaceitaly absolutely
[0:08:18] <+Reverend_Roscoe> I have a nephew named Lucien and he's a giant
[0:08:19] <@Solidus_113> body-locked names
[0:08:24] <Zomner> üêÄ ?
[0:08:34] <Jaysky> Can't you remove thoughts?
[0:08:35] <nojjod420> shout-outs to rat movie
[0:08:40] <tattleworm> names mean physical characteristics doesn't seem that much removed from phrenology
[0:08:42] <KaiserMario> Jean-Lucky Charms Boivin
[0:08:43] <Equirah> "accidentaly" became a centrist
[0:08:47] <%Subtlevictory> Subtlevictory subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 6 month streak! 
[0:08:48] <+OblivionSword1> you can it cost a skill point
[0:08:49] <+Mendin> @WoolieVersus new chapter update of Helltaker just dropped
[0:08:52] <Lancaster_H> you can, but it costs a skill point @Jaysky
[0:08:56] <iacus_> "centrism" is horribly represented in this game, it's the least coherent alignment
[0:09:00] <Zomner> CUNO'S CUNO, C
[0:09:01] <%ThisIsLloyd> KUNO mirakuruKill
[0:09:09] <$hattrick61> fucked by the cun
[0:09:09] <$dudedude55555> nothing wrong with being centrist
[0:09:10] <Jaysky> @Lancaster_H Ooh, I've yet to remove one
[0:09:12] <seniormeatbox> @iacus_ So it's 100% accurate then lol
[0:09:24] <%krispen_wa> LUL
[0:09:25] <+Vigonept> theyre all pretty dumb, some of that communism stuff... was ehhhhhh
[0:09:25] <%X2Eliah> @iacus_ No that's just accurate
[0:09:35] <%AlteisenReiseZ> LUL
[0:09:45] <%chandlerofearth> sorry, still figuring out twitch, I just subbed and I didn't see a message prompt. is it only for re-subs?
[0:09:45] <%X2Eliah> The point of the game is, going super hard in any political direction is stupid
[0:09:51] <Lancaster_H> centrism is more "dude i dont care" in this game, which is also accurate
[0:09:57] <iacus_> It's "accurate" only if you get your political science from american podcasts
[0:10:02] <BigManLugan> nice job man!
[0:10:03] <gunsrlove> Woolie saying names are based on genetic make-up, Measurehead being called Jean-Luc, it's all connected Kappa Kappa
[0:10:14] <Equirah> now he's post LUL
[0:10:20] <%Seancicle> üôåüèªüôåüèªüôåüèª
[0:10:25] <iacus_> @X2Eliah yeah but at least the others are portrayed with some internal consistency
[0:10:38] <%krispen_wa> the game criticizes centrists who don't commit. the game HATES people who commit to centrism
[0:10:39] <Indigo_Automaton> Physical Instrument go UP
[0:10:40] <%Juriasu> no longer a ham sandwich
[0:10:49] <andre11dr> Ok i didn't miss anything, as expected
[0:10:50] <%Seancicle> au contraire mon fr√®re
[0:11:09] <Equirah> people really trying to defend centrism over here.....
[0:11:43] <iacus_> Because most people don't know what centrism is
[0:11:51] <Jaysky> My body rejects protein hard
[0:11:57] <%X2Eliah> Body inertia is real
[0:12:16] <Jaysky> If I take too much protein it gives me intense stomach aches for the rest of the day and it fuckin sucks
[0:12:18] <gunsrlove> Keto is not a weightloss diet, a calorie deficit is. Keto was created for people with conditions that might be affected by large amounts of carbs, such as seizures, glucose oxidation, the "brain fog" , etc.
[0:12:24] <+Damie904> Woolie ur not alone, I got a similar body. Gotta go hardcore or nothing.
[0:12:35] <%X2Eliah> @Jaysky Any protein? If it's Whey, could be lactose related
[0:12:38] <andre11dr> Most people think centrism is just " everyone just do you" which is not what it is
[0:12:40] <sushahana> hardcore!
[0:12:46] <%nicversus> if your balls ain't hard go home
[0:12:58] <+OblivionSword1> HARDCORE
[0:13:05] <Lancaster_H> TO THE MAX!
[0:13:08] <Equirah> cheat days tho
[0:13:11] <%X2Eliah> YEKOKATAA
[0:13:13] <%krispen_wa> INTERNALLY COHERENT
[0:13:23] <+Mendin> But is it really?
[0:13:24] <%Seancicle> toute gloire est d√©riv√©e de YHWH
[0:13:24] <Jaysky> @Jaysky I've tried various kinds, made sure it wasn't whey later on and it'll still do it. I can get away with a protein bar but if I make a shake? I'm dead.
[0:13:35] <+metzselaar> But what is the question?
[0:13:36] <cBERBEN> im trying to gain weight but its extremely hard :(
[0:13:50] <%cobalt_phoenix_> god i cant wait for then, like a month from now LUL
[0:13:52] <+Mendin> It's only a riddle if you don't know the answer.
[0:14:14] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:14:14] <X2Eliah> Top 5 is too many
[0:14:15] <+Vigonept> low authority!
[0:14:16] <%X2Eliah> LUL
[0:14:16] <Jaysky> 3's better
[0:14:21] <$dudedude55555> authority: 1
[0:14:23] <%the_Punktuation> fair
[0:14:24] <andre11dr> if i say Inland Empire does that mean that im crazy?
[0:14:24] <+OblivionSword1> low perception for sure
[0:14:26] <%krispen_wa> I keep trying to cut carbs from my diet, but rice is literally what i was raised on
[0:14:28] <Ids560> the QA version of esprit de corps
[0:14:29] <+walternatorz> 4. One from each main stat.
[0:14:33] <+Mrbaconator> perception 1
[0:14:34] <iacus_> half-light
[0:14:38] <+Abii_Artesian> hey @woolieversus  I work with Artesian and wanted to stop in and say Hey
[0:14:39] <Blank9> reggie is volition
[0:14:41] <%X2Eliah> @andre11dr nah, just imaginative
[0:14:45] <Lancaster_H> perception 0
[0:14:48] <+Mrbaconator> reggie is volition
[0:14:50] <%Seancicle> üññüèªü§üüèª
[0:14:55] <Chatterbox1991> Half Light, Visual Calculus, Logic, Shivers, Inland Empire.
[0:14:58] <BigManLugan> hand-eye coordination for sick combos
[0:15:03] <AvroEltz> Character woolie has 10 drama
[0:15:05] <+Prevot> how high is your cop stat? LUL
[0:15:06] <+Mendin> Volta Do Mar
[0:15:08] <primaryfire> esprit de corps for the narcs
[0:15:18] <+SammyOVision> Hand eye/interfacing for sure
[0:15:21] <%wolfofsound> hand eye coordination
[0:15:23] <%X2Eliah> Conceptualization must be woolie's dump stat
[0:15:26] <+BappoTheMighty> lol
[0:15:38] <+OblivionSword1> hand eye and interfacing probably
[0:15:39] <%krispen_wa> Isn't Pat's Conceptualization literally 0?
[0:15:44] <%gatorafan> I imagine in Disco's rules having a primary stat doesn't make you crazy, but leveling it up to a certain point does daedra1DerpyTibs
[0:15:46] <haitakaa> conceptualize left from right
[0:15:46] <Blank9> rhetoric for woolie
[0:15:47] <andre11dr> Woolie has high drama and savoir faire I'd say
[0:15:48] <%X2Eliah> @krispen_wa ? no
[0:15:57] <%X2Eliah> @Blank9 omg yes
[0:16:10] <Lancaster_H> yeah woolies signature is definitely rhetoric
[0:16:11] <%X2Eliah> @Blank9 He's literally demonstrating it now
[0:16:12] <%krispen_wa> @x2eliah he cant even imagine why people want to roleplay a character in D&D
[0:16:13] <+Mendin> Pat's Art-Making is 0, but he has solid conceptualization
[0:16:17] <$dudedude55555> woolie is all drama rhetoric, 0 everything else
[0:16:28] <iacus_> the descriptions of the skills say that high levels have disadvantages, but in-game the player always retains control to ignore their extra dialogue options
[0:16:35] <%nicversus> Woolie will figure it out
[0:16:37] <iacus_> so, not really
[0:16:48] <Lancaster_H> @iacus_ not always, but youre mostly right
[0:16:52] <andre11dr> maybe he has a 2 or 1 in physical Instrument
[0:17:03] <Lancaster_H> @iacus_ authority takes over a couple times for sure
[0:17:08] <%wolfofsound> mine is electrochemistry LUL
[0:17:08] <%gatorafan> I'm probably Half-Light daedra1DrunkTibs
[0:17:13] <iaraCatunda> i love your content Mr woolz
[0:17:13] <aiutare47> @iacus_ yes and no, you can get locked out
[0:17:22] <%Vextalyst> cheer500 I believe in you man it was your morning jogging updates that got me going in the beginning I literally had to spend $500 on an oculus to trick my stupid brain and body into exercising so i know the feels Good luck Woolie
[0:17:27] <iacus_> Oh, that's cool then. I didn't know
[0:17:30] <slix3431> I would go with Half-light
[0:17:32] <Indigo_Automaton> You're Conceptualization can be high but it doesn't mean you share tastes with other artists
[0:17:34] <Blank9> conceptualization, but you keep it in your head for the thoughts you go "oh god no"
[0:17:38] <%X2Eliah> @WoolieVersus But which empathy stat
[0:17:41] <gecomaman> The stat is too much of a poet
[0:17:53] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> my inland empire and empathy are WAY too high lol
[0:17:55] <%the_Punktuation> cool
[0:17:56] <Daxalog> Which stats makes you into an E-Star? Get THOSE.
[0:18:00] <andre11dr> Emphati is also about getting people on your side too
[0:18:04] <@Solidus_113> Woolie's got some Rhetoric with breaking down his views for others to understand, but he still constantly loses debates
[0:18:10] <+BappoTheMighty> Pats 2 highest stats is Drama and Perception.
[0:18:12] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[0:18:13] <Lancaster_H> rhetoric, but its low level
[0:18:17] <gecomaman> Volition and espre de corp are the best IMO
[0:18:18] <andre11dr> Actually wait no, im thinking of suggestion
[0:18:18] <+xerotwo> LUL
[0:18:20] <CatRidder> shivers
[0:18:36] <user_naim> Woolie might be Conceptualization
[0:18:36] <RaiNiMayonnaise> the internet just has a low logic stat
[0:18:43] <The_Gonzales_Experience> VOLTA DO MAR
[0:18:44] <Chatterbox1991> @WoolieVersus you have to cut yourself some slack eventually (and that's coming from me)
[0:18:45] <%justcallmebobplease> VOLITION
[0:18:50] <andre11dr> Volition
[0:18:51] <Lancaster_H> volition
[0:18:57] <+BappoTheMighty> Volition/Logic
[0:18:57] <atgithursdays> We neuro atypical now?
[0:18:59] <+pupil31> SHEEEESH
[0:19:02] <%justcallmebobplease> Volition dude
[0:19:05] <zanzibarian_hamster> Inland empire?
[0:19:11] <%X2Eliah> volition or inland
[0:19:24] <andre11dr> Nah Inland Empire is more of hyper imagination
[0:19:27] <%kewlmyc> That's more volition than logic
[0:19:29] <%krispen_wa> he tries to do logic, but his electrochemistry's hype over vergils and punchgirls overrites it
[0:19:30] <%X2Eliah> logic would be more immediate
[0:19:30] <%gatorafan> Inland for me too sajamGuapo
[0:20:03] <%Seancicle> contexte manquant
[0:20:03] <CatRidder> esprit de corps
[0:20:04] <Lancaster_H> woolie using rhetoric to explain his volition
[0:20:08] <+xerotwo> Shivers?
[0:20:10] <nailwind> possibly a boring pick but composure for me for sure
[0:20:11] <%X2Eliah> @CatRidder LUL
[0:20:14] <Indigo_Automaton> Logic is like math for ideas
[0:20:17] <%the_Punktuation> cool cool, I appreciate the answer
[0:20:21] <elshadow7> Woolie's rhetoric is compromised.
[0:20:31] <Jaysky> Volition, Inland Empire, Empathy, Logic, Visual Calculus
[0:20:36] <Ids560> Esprit de Quality Assurance
[0:20:41] <Chatterbox1991> @WoolieVersus  do you have any stat that is over 9? to the point where it's a problem?
[0:20:46] <yomamma133713> the average person sucks at rhetoric tbh
[0:20:54] <+Mr_Pylon> Pat's running a Reaction Speed and Half Light argument strat, hard to beat
[0:20:55] <+walternatorz> Pat is impervious to logical attempts.
[0:20:57] <LlewynMarie> i feel that
[0:21:05] <atgithursdays> The auts is hard
[0:21:06] <%krispen_wa> the decent streamer has to  have a ton of volition to deal with the ONE GUYS
[0:21:09] <$hattrick61> your rhetoric is ok, but the internet's is infinite
[0:21:13] <andre11dr> For me I'd say Inland, Suggestion, Conceptualization,Half Life, Physical Instrument
[0:21:13] <%Deft_Thought> Reggie is clearly big on Half-Light
[0:21:19] <Lancaster_H> reggie has decent savoir faire id say
[0:21:19] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:21:19] <+walternatorz> interfacing
[0:21:20] <zanzibarian_hamster> Rhetoric is a difficult stat to level
[0:21:24] <%Deft_Thought> Look at him, he's got a killer's eyes
[0:21:24] <Jaysky> @Mr_Pylon Pat is Pat, and Cuno is Cuno
[0:21:32] <$dudedude55555> reggie is all about elec chem
[0:21:33] <+Mendin> Reggie was a Badmintonier, he has some FYS and MOT
[0:21:43] <iacus_> being on the internet pushed me to turbo-level my Rhetoric
[0:21:47] <The_Gonzales_Experience> Boxing sounds like a Phys Instrument thing
[0:21:52] <andre11dr> My visual Calculus is at 0
[0:21:57] <%kyh9> Reaction speed, physical instrument and Drama for me
[0:21:59] <%X2Eliah> @The_Gonzales_Experience Yeah but he's a novice at it
[0:22:11] <ulcaban> Contextual modifiers
[0:22:11] <atgithursdays> Woolie confirmed for pegging
[0:22:12] <user_naim> Some Composure, Volition, Empathy, Logic, Drama and Conceptualization. Plus a bit of Pain Threshold.
[0:22:14] <enZymeth> High pain threshold dealing with chat
[0:22:16] <%fetrigon> ye that's hand eye coordination and muscle memory
[0:22:23] <%hax_metatron> I think you're supposed to have points in a lot of stats
[0:22:25] <%hax_metatron> Not just 2-3 of them
[0:22:26] <%Deft_Thought> Every nerd has a high Inland Empire
[0:22:28] <%fetrigon> MMMM
[0:22:34] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> woolie has atleast decent phys instrmnt
[0:22:40] <$emptyantics> Woolie has 8 Pain Threshold

[0:30:21] <sushahana> high good low bad
[0:30:22] <+AbnormalVoid> high number good, low number bad
[0:30:25] <%krispen_wa> So how would Francis York Morgan react to Disco Elysium man?
[0:30:26] <DSD24> Honor Cop
[0:30:31] <+Prevot> you like communism more than Kim likes you
[0:30:32] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @Theycallmenerf then you're in for a good time.  last session had some strong moments
[0:30:34] <oda_flobunaga> day 3 or later
[0:30:36] <derap41> Can you up the game volume
[0:30:40] <+OblivionSword1> game volume is really low
[0:30:45] <Jaysky> You're black
[0:30:47] <%X2Eliah> Yeah song pickup is day 3 +
[0:30:48] <%Theycallmenerf> Wouldn‚Äôt good cop/bad cop just be a base charisma stat? I‚Äôm going off of Fallout stat knowledge.
[0:30:56] <Dave_VD> Yo chat, given the nature of this game do I have to worry about being 'spoiled' on stuff if I just watch a stream here and there before playing it?
[0:30:58] <sushahana> did he go in the kitchen?
[0:31:00] <ingman112> Game volume is a bit low
[0:31:01] <andre11dr> Wait do you ever find the song after failing the phone thing?
[0:31:02] <%dalmek> @krispen_wa if Disco man had high enough Inland he could probably talk to Zack too
[0:31:03] <Jaysky> Wait, that didn't go as a reply?
[0:31:05] <%X2Eliah> @WoolieVersus Just saying but game audio does seem crazy low
[0:31:13] <derap41> Perception(hearing) Failed you hear nothing
[0:31:16] <+Mr_Pylon> Yeah audio very low
[0:31:18] <slix3431> Woolie didn't box enough
[0:31:18] <+OblivionSword1> @WoolieVersus volume is really low
[0:31:22] <SomeAsianDood> @dave_vd it's very story focused. easy to get spoiles
[0:31:26] <KaseKaizer> dude has been sleeping all day
[0:31:31] <%JustToWatch> I missed the last session, did Woolie talk to Joyce?
[0:31:32] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> game audio is low
[0:31:35] <SpartanAltego> The game's audio is quite low, Woolz.
[0:31:39] <Inqy833> @Dave_VD Yes, this is the type of game that can be spoiled, although personally I've had fun playing it even when I've been spoiled on stuff.
[0:31:42] <iacus_> he's not that important
[0:31:48] <derap41> Just a sleeping drunk what could he know
[0:31:51] <%krispen_wa> @justtowatch he did, but not about R E A L I T Y yet
[0:31:54] <andre11dr> Perception: You're black
[0:31:59] <Jaysky> Last I played I upped my phsy and successfully punches big race boy
[0:32:00] <%Seancicle> nous parle au mains
[0:32:01] <+OblivionSword1> @WoolieVersus game audio is really low
[0:32:07] <gecomaman> Joyce has more stuff!
[0:32:10] <elshadow7> You can talk to Joyce a bit more if you'd like
[0:32:16] <%thetunnelhomer> Woolievs: Get into Race Theory
[0:32:21] <%Theycallmenerf> I‚Äôve wanted to play this but I feel like I don‚Äôt have enough free time to actually enjoy all it has to offer.
[0:32:23] <%X2Eliah> Yeah footsteps and music is ok now
[0:32:23] <iacus_> you need to find a song and a player to do the karaoke quest

[0:32:53] <%frickenmoron> Tuck Kim into bed
[0:32:56] <+metzselaar> Kim talk is also an option
[0:32:59] <%dalmek> night is also good for reading stuff without worrying about wasting time
[0:33:06] <+theCatastrophy> see joyce after kim goes to bed
[0:33:08] <%Theycallmenerf> Books? I think you mean a Doujin/smut
[0:33:08] <%JustToWatch> it's almost 11 and I NEED an autobiography of a famous person
[0:33:11] <gecomaman> Never finished all her dialogue remember?
[0:33:23] <%cobalt_phoenix_> LEDGER

[0:33:29] <laserbeaming> Compartment Time
[0:33:31] <%X2Eliah> hidden compo
[0:33:31] <%krispen_wa> Just keep examining the mug
[0:33:32] <Dave_VD> @SomeAsianDood @Inqy833 Okay thank you! I figured since there are so many ways that situations can play out I would be safe just watching a stream or two. I've had to dodge a lot of streams between this and 13 sentinels
[0:33:33] <SomeAsianDood> they haven't debriefed yet have they
[0:33:33] <ingman112> Yeah you‚Äôre very limited with what you can do right now. No shame in calling it a night after some reading/Joyce chatting
[0:33:38] <%krispen_wa> until you get mega racist
[0:33:39] <andre11dr> Now i did not sleep a night and nothing really happened, does sleeping actually matter?
[0:33:44] <iacus_> oh the compartment. I did that recently in my own 2nd playthrough

[0:35:09] <Inqy833> @Dave_VD I think the best way to think of it is that Disco Elysium is a murder mystery. But it's a really well written one with lots of layers where the murder isn't actually what the story is about.

[0:44:12] <%X2Eliah> good stats tho
[0:44:12] <aiutare47> you took scripted damage
[0:44:14] <lol_red_ranger> you did take damage but you healed it back from water
[0:44:14] <+rusefus> Now the game can begin
[0:44:15] <+elhafnero> elhafnero subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:44:15] <Blank9> all because you read that letter
[0:44:16] <Eger007> endurance check saved you
[0:44:18] <primaryfire> well you didn't die you just passed out
[0:44:18] <%cobalt_phoenix_> and a title drop
[0:44:19] <+MrAtheGreat> Btw white mourning ain't bad
[0:44:20] <aiutare47> Cutscene damage
[0:44:28] <%hax_metatron> Read the ledger description
[0:44:38] <SomeAsianDood> @llewynmarie his nickname implies his burnt out ruins
[0:44:47] <+MrAtheGreat> Indotribe ain't bad either
[0:44:50] <+Mendin> la petit mort
[0:44:54] <+eashw> good afternoon friends
[0:45:03] <+eashw> just got my second vaccine dose üí™
[0:45:04] <iacus_> that's cool
[0:45:06] <derap41> Now this is interesting
[0:45:17] <iacus_> I got caustic echo instead and the ledger turned into something else
[0:45:19] <slix3431> @eashw Grats
[0:45:23] <+Javaa01> It gives you *perspective*
[0:45:23] <+za7az> It's pretty good
[0:45:31] <+Mendin> Reminder that since you finished Jammy Vu, Joyce has something new to talk about regarding Reality
[0:45:33] <+MrAtheGreat> @eashw CONGRATS PogChamp PogChamp SeemsGood
[0:45:39] <derap41> Love those MegaDeth Glasses
[0:45:46] <+eashw> :D
[0:45:49] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @eashw congrats dude!
[0:45:51] <+MrAtheGreat> WORSE
[0:45:51] <+projectmanatees> dem stats tho
[0:45:53] <+MrAtheGreat> LUL
[0:45:53] <%hax_metatron> You can equip ledger now too
[0:45:53] <$emptyantics> THE FUCKING WRITING BibleThump
[0:45:54] <aiutare47> Joyce might be a good person to talk to now
[0:45:56] <GarbageNirvana> Depending on where you open that up you have an option to let the letter blow away in the wind
[0:45:56] <+IvesNapalm> Check those stats
[0:45:59] <derap41> What does it give you
[0:45:59] <mr_sups> Heal that Morale. You need some of that Volition
[0:46:00] <SolSwagGuy56> DON'T LET IT SET IN
[0:46:04] <Blank9> can still read the ledger itself
[0:46:04] <LlewynMarie> @SomeAsianDood that's true
[0:46:05] <%krispen_wa> YER A HARRY, WIZARD
[0:46:06] <reonome> NotLikeThis

[0:46:26] <derap41> Blue Hearty
[0:46:27] <soundcloud_raptor> yer eye nal
[0:46:32] <+eashw> YOU RINE AL CLEANER
[0:46:33] <+IvesNapalm> Those stat increases are so good
[0:46:34] <%X2Eliah> Yeah that was the main thing
[0:46:35] <SolSwagGuy56> No wonder we threw it out
[0:46:39] <ToxInjection> LUL YE
[0:46:39] <Canadian_Suit> i can't wait for the next CONTENT button (red check)
[0:46:42] <%X2Eliah> you have basically completed the ledger now
[0:46:42] <Chatterbox1991> you get more stuff if you look at the gum wrapper now
[0:46:53] <ToxInjection> awh, damn it.
[0:46:55] <%Theycallmenerf> [Paperback Writer] [Guess who] [Who Are You]
[0:46:55] <derap41> Made you into a feely dude
[0:47:05] <elshadow7> @GarbageNirvana is that location based? I thought it was stat based?
[0:47:12] <%X2Eliah> AS IT SHOULD
[0:47:14] <dds333a> Authority takes hits
[0:47:14] <mr_sups> 1 Volition
[0:47:16] <LordOfThePoultry> THATS BAD
[0:47:17] <Blank9> authority rules
[0:47:20] <+walternatorz> what cop has authority holding a note pad?
[0:47:23] <+IvesNapalm> That inland empire increase should allow a reroll?
[0:47:23] <srv4254> authority and electro chem seem to do more harm than good
[0:47:24] <primaryfire> authority is cool
[0:47:26] <derap41> Auth is overated just  be a doormap
[0:47:29] <%X2Eliah> Authority is just the racist stat
[0:47:30] <+walternatorz> other than Kim
[0:47:30] <KaseKaizer> I am the law?
[0:47:30] <+projectmanatees> jesus that volation is low
[0:47:32] <Johannen> One cannot establish authority if you cannot handle looking at yourself in the mirror)
[0:47:33] <DSD24> @walternatorz Cole Phelps?
[0:47:34] <LlewynMarie> Holding thing ledger gives you +1
[0:47:35] <ingman112> You can interact with the photo as well, if you didn‚Äôt already
[0:47:37] <Inqy833> Turns out being sensitive and understanding makes it harder to walk all over people.
[0:47:41] <linSP> you need a LITTLE facism
[0:47:41] <ToxInjection> Remember, you're Cuno
[0:47:42] <Blank9> authority's never racist
[0:47:43] <shakespearo> @X2Eliah Nah that's Phys Instrument
[0:47:46] <derap41> Stat up
[0:47:48] <andre11dr> A lot of shit takes down authority early on
[0:47:52] <%X2Eliah> @X2Eliah well both tbh
[0:47:52] <%nicversus> un peu de fascism
[0:47:57] <laserbeaming> Authority is not as bad as chat says.
[0:48:05] <+IvesNapalm> Violation stat drops as you take damage
[0:48:07] <%krispen_wa> authority has a lot of uses
[0:48:11] <derap41> Authority is an asshole 90% of the time
[0:48:19] <Inqy833> Authority is a very useful skill with bad opinions.
[0:48:20] <+MrAtheGreat> Authority is one of the best stats in the game so maybe keep that in mind
[0:48:23] <+OblivionSword1> it'll be useful for some things
[0:48:23] <derap41> but somtimes you need an asshole
[0:48:23] <%bread_assassin> Endurance is the stat that governs fascism. IF any stat is racist, it's that one.
[0:48:25] <Ids560> authority does let you do one of the best checks in the game
[0:48:27] <available_line> @IvesNapalm Volition
[0:48:33] <%X2Eliah> @Inqy833 That'sa very good summary of it yeah
[0:48:35] <SomeAsianDood> authority has no chill, but sometimes u need no chill
[0:48:36] <+rusefus> let kim sleep
[0:48:37] <DSD24> Joyce is a nice name
[0:48:37] <srv4254> authority is wrong and a dick at most of the time
[0:48:39] <laserbeaming> Authority is an asshole, but a very useful asshole
[0:48:40] <Blank9> It's not even much of an asshole unless you're brainless and think you have to use it everytime
[0:48:44] <$emptyantics> I feel like you can‚Äôt have high Authority without being some kind of asshole in real life
[0:48:47] <sushahana> joyce talk is long
[0:48:48] <derap41> @srv4254 But he gets it done
[0:48:49] <%hax_metatron> Chat let it happen, don't get carried away by the hype and spoil
[0:48:52] <dds333a> Physical Instrument is great, and my favorite, but boy can he be fricking intrusive in actual stuff

[1:01:39] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @zanzibarian_hamster
[1:01:40] <shakespearo> Also Moralists shoot more people than anyone else left in the world
[1:01:40] <nelsonsaysbooya> Big talk from someone who shot a child
[1:01:42] <laserbeaming> The Moralist are more insidious than that. They do the shooting discretely
[1:01:43] <@Solidus_113> literally never an option
[1:01:44] <derap41> @kyh9 They get Murdered

[1:02:31] <miucsa51> DOGMATIC CENTRISM
[1:02:32] <ingman112> Pick a side fucker
[1:02:32] <iacus_> told you the game handles centrism pretty poorly, probably on purpose
[1:02:32] <%kyh9> Unsatisfying just like REAL politics

[1:02:54] <megamirk> I agree with not shooting people in the head, unless they're communists
[1:03:00] <GarbageNirvana> Centrists shoot people in the head where it won't cause consequences for them back home
[1:03:00] <DSD24> I also did a moralist playthough
[1:03:01] <%fudgex453> "morality is bad" woolie 2021
[1:03:01] <derap41> Not shooting people in the head is just the first step to Moralism

[1:06:19] <shakespearo> Joyce brokw down in quarantine and ate bread

[1:06:45] <andre11dr> Joyce is definitely a capitalist
[1:06:53] <Inqy833> @X2Eliah But in a couple of hundred years, your great great grandchildren might get a share in a boating concern.

[1:07:43] <Hydrapissed> like america and the south lol
[1:07:45] <megamirk> I wonder how much of this was inspired by Estonian history
[1:07:48] <+MrAtheGreat> Woolie now going Fascist route damn those foreigners
[1:07:50] <andre11dr> Like most of Eastern Europe
[1:07:53] <dds333a> In an MGS context, one could say the establishment of Outer Heaven/Haven
[1:07:53] <derap41> @Hydrapissed Bingo
[1:07:53] <ingman112> Post WWII was a crazy time
[1:07:57] <CatRidder> checoslovakia
[1:07:59] <%hax_metatron> Because you don't have money to eat
[1:08:00] <SomeAsianDood> almost like the Soviet bloc

[1:08:06] <shakespearo> Weimar is like a pretty hilarious bumblefuck. Or it would be if it hadn't directly resulted in WW2
[1:08:09] <+pupil31> SIPP Yep those were the days
[1:08:09] <iacus_> it's like a mix of easter europe and... chapo nonsense

[1:08:15] <$dudedude55555> grandpas are sleeping
[1:08:15] <Oddere> I like that revachol has had pretty much every political system and each one has failed it
[1:08:20] <Inqy833> Joyce is far enough up the conservative great chain of being that she can afford to be honest about it. Always interesting talking to the truly upper class conservatives like that.
[1:08:21] <miucsa51> Yep
[1:08:22] <+metzselaar> @livingdynamo @procrastiamus @SomeAsianDood Thanks
[1:08:22] <Iwashi94> a lot of it is very inspired by Eastern Europe and the ex-soviet countries I think
[1:08:23] <megamirk> masss cultureee
[1:08:26] <%kyh9> More than that: the definition of ‚Äútraditionalist‚Äù expands greatly when things change too quicjly
[1:08:27] <derap41> POP Culture

[1:09:41] <%ppangboi> Joyce definitely has a view from the top
[1:09:42] <iacus_> That's exaclty it, woolie
[1:09:42] <ToxInjection> That teen working the Frittte store is probably one
[1:09:46] <%hax_metatron> In some countries being centrist is literally demonic.

[1:10:18] <derap41> like really really cool
[1:10:27] <%fudgex453> new thought slot?
[1:10:28] <ToxInjection> Cuno's not a voter!
[1:10:30] <+OblivionSword1> pump more into shivers
[1:10:31] <munitalprats> another thought
[1:10:34] <Fuji808> The girl at Freittte is literally that, Woolie. Young, destroyed people, disinterested in the rubble they live on.
[1:10:34] <munitalprats> get another thought :)
[1:10:35] <lyzejag> Volition yeaaah
[1:10:35] <DSD24> Shivers only playthough
[1:10:36] <%X2Eliah> Do what you want
[1:10:37] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:10:37] <derap41> thoughts?
[1:10:37] <Oddere> espirit for that check?
[1:10:38] <+mads_valentine> Jamias Vu!
[1:10:41] <elshadow7> That Volition's pretty low
[1:10:41] <Project205> Volition is goat
[1:10:41] <ingman112> Volition might need a boost
[1:10:41] <+MrAtheGreat> Volition is one of the best stats
[1:10:43] <the_allturtle> What happend to the Paris commune is more simillar to what happend to Revachol. The eastern block wasn't really chrushed by forcefull internationalist intervention. But there are of course other parallells to post-soviet countries.
[1:10:43] <dds333a> The good old Bubble economy
[1:10:48] <%gatorafan> you do you daedra1DerpyTibs
[1:10:48] <Ids560> as pat said 5 isn't as important as 6
[1:10:49] <derap41> Thoughts do a lot more than stats
[1:10:51] <Blank9> getting all the shivers already
[1:10:52] <+Vivaciousx3> save it for a check
[1:10:54] <Iwashi94> level half light?
[1:10:55] <SomeAsianDood> volition is cuz morale damage
[1:10:57] <primaryfire> you should aim to get any thought you like up to 4 at least
[1:10:58] <LlewynMarie> Empathy
[1:10:58] <dukenux> prolly safe to give Volition
[1:10:58] <andre11dr> As a man from eastern Europe, most people know the history, but they don't care about it ,because " fuck those people, we ain't that anymore"
[1:10:58] <$dudedude55555> you want those thoughts tho
[1:11:00] <%hax_metatron> Volition for sure
[1:11:00] <dukenux> *to
[1:11:03] <Fuji808> Boost the stats that help you redo checks.
[1:11:03] <aiutare47> @WoolieVersus What white checks do you have to redo?
[1:11:05] <asdief_> Volition
[1:11:05] <iacus_> save it for another check
[1:11:06] <+OblivionSword1> max shivers out why not
[1:11:08] <%X2Eliah> Shivers
[1:11:11] <%ppangboi> shivers at 4 is safe to stay for a bit
[1:11:11] <sushahana> shivers high is too good
[1:11:12] <pillowheadgirl> Volition is my dude
[1:11:13] <%X2Eliah> Go shivers
[1:11:13] <+MrAtheGreat> yeah it's 3 right now
[1:11:14] <bonebagMEL> Volition is VERY Important
[1:11:15] <yomamma133713> save it, honestly
[1:11:15] <primaryfire> at 4 you get more passive checks
[1:11:16] <CatRidder> thoughts are more important, some of them give you bonus xp
[1:11:19] <dukenux> Even numbers, right?
[1:11:20] <%hax_metatron> More morale is good, Volition. You'll get toins of points later
[1:11:22] <%X2Eliah> He has 3 volition

[1:12:26] <CatRidder> 2
[1:12:32] <derap41> Was GME luck?
[1:12:33] <iacus_> it's always luck
[1:12:34] <Hydrapissed> a wise gamble or a lucky guess
[1:12:37] <%X2Eliah> What would you pick Reg?
[1:12:43] <yomamma133713> 100% luck
[1:12:44] <+MrAtheGreat> was it lucky to choose the guys with the guns
[1:12:46] <derap41> Was Tesla Luck?
[1:12:59] <%kyh9> It‚Äôs not luck that the corporation sided with the capitalist forces
[1:12:59] <iacus_> but it's literally as arbitrary as that
[1:13:01] <AMaidIndeed> Luck only works if you can capitalize on it
[1:13:01] <+Prevot> luck is a skill
[1:13:02] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> You chose wisely sounds approving though?
[1:13:03] <derap41> are we throwing dice on the market here
[1:13:03] <dds333a> You could take this way further
[1:13:04] <CatRidder> luck is a skill
[1:13:08] <+procrastiamus> luck and a whole lot of union breaking
[1:13:10] <AMaidIndeed> luck is a skill
[1:13:14] <%gatorafan> woolieMINHMAX
[1:13:16] <Lelfro> they picked a side, they didn't do anything
[1:13:21] <iacus_> it's not reductionist, how could they heve predicted the winning side?
[1:13:22] <Johannen> But what if you had to choose one of the fighters and not participate yourself?
[1:13:22] <nelsonsaysbooya> We all know it's only 10% luck
[1:13:24] <lyzejag> "Lucky' means killing all the communist i guess
[1:13:26] <Ids560> I mean picking a side when it's not clear who's gonna win is lucky
[1:13:36] <derap41> oh this is interesting
[1:13:44] <dds333a> I agree, but one could really make the point that it is

[1:20:18] <laserbeaming> The catalyst for the revolution was a Pandemic. Not the real cause, but the excuse
[1:20:18] <+Vivaciousx3> thats what its implying
[1:20:23] <elshadow7> A solution to the pandemic that ended up causing the revolutin
[1:20:27] <ingman112> Medical moderation vs. kill more vs. selfish positioning vs.  who knows

[1:22:14] <munitalprats> CLEANSING ARTILLERY FIRE
[1:22:17] <Blank9> prions turn your brain into sponges
[1:22:21] <munitalprats> ITS THE ONLY SOLUTION
[1:22:23] <dukenux> You can't fight them like a traditional disease

[1:22:24] <%kyh9> Quarter of humanity
[1:22:24] <dds333a> 4 is the correct response. don't bother, it won't help in the end
[1:22:25] <pi_in_the_sci> Mad Cow Disease is a prion disease
[1:22:26] <Pt_Kamen> Mad Cow Disease is Prionic
[1:22:29] <+babyacid> its mad cow
[1:22:30] <sendart> AVE IMPERATOR shatter their skys
[1:22:30] <zanzibarian_hamster> Remember mad cow's disease? They set fire to ENTIRE HERDS OF COWS to get rid of them

[1:22:44] <CatRidder> spanish flu
[1:22:44] <AMaidIndeed> Mad Cow Disease
[1:22:46] <ingman112> All you need to know is ultra bad. Prions can change their shape to latch onto other proteins; they can be frozen for extended periods of time and still live. They are nigh unkillable outside of heat
[1:22:47] <derap41> Dementia
[1:22:47] <dukenux> Brains turn into sponge
[1:22:48] <%X2Eliah> @WoolieVersus Mad Cow Disease

[1:23:25] <dukenux> yeah, whole cow heards where slaughtered and burned
[1:23:29] <shakespearo> Prions roll up in your crib and convince all your bro-proteins that they should be cool and sexy like the prion. And then you die
[1:23:29] <+rusefus> load up the cannons
[1:23:30] <derap41> Mink Covid
[1:23:30] <aiutare47> Minks due to a covid infection
[1:23:31] <+Prevot> and then stopped doing the things that caused mad cow disease
[1:23:32] <DSD24> Stinkmink's are cute in MH Rise
[1:23:33] <zanzibarian_hamster> Kill and set on fire, it made the country smell of bacon
[1:23:34] <Inqy833> "Murder all the angry people who are rising up against the government" seems kinda... right wing.
[1:23:35] <Oddere> you dont
[1:23:36] <munitalprats> k-k-k-kill em all!
[1:23:40] <%cobalt_phoenix_> you literally can't
[1:23:40] <%X2Eliah> Also for Covid. Minks were killed in Denmark for covid
[1:23:44] <munitalprats> you dont. you cleanse them with artillery fire!
[1:23:46] <+MrAtheGreat> It literally melted minds @WoolieVersus
[1:23:47] <%chandlerofearth> I think 2 is the fascist option, because you're calling them diseased dogs
[1:23:48] <+mads_valentine> Woolie, *dogs* means Communists in this case
[1:23:49] <AnneSQF> Yep, mink covid
[1:23:54] <dukenux> You can't treat it as other diseases
[1:24:01] <Hydrapissed> kill em all lol
[1:24:01] <Pt_Kamen> You don't treat Prionic Disease, it's game over
[1:24:02] <ingman112> They‚Äôre not zombies, just rapidly decomposing while alive
[1:24:03] <%DiscoMatador> Replace Dogs with Commies

[1:31:28] <CatRidder> LIGHTLATER
[1:31:33] <%wolfofsound> @nicversus LUL
[1:31:34] <dukenux> "I can change her" option

[1:31:38] <derap41> @nicversus A bit yea
[1:31:39] <heemwizard> there is one person in a container....
[1:31:40] <LunarRemix> You can hustle and pay for you hostel
[1:31:41] <aiutare47> Keep in mind Joyce is a professional negotiator. Her job is to make people like her.
[1:31:41] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1392160075305865219
[1:31:45] <Hydrapissed> grey but evillllllllllllllllll but hot
[1:31:45] <%krispen_wa> She is the most charming character besides Kim.
[1:31:46] <+Kataguro> Joyce's Charisma stat is maxed out
[1:31:47] <mr_sups> @nicversus Shit man LUL
[1:31:52] <+Jiggisnipe> yes people like friendly and polite people, what's new?
[1:31:53] <%hax_metatron> I can't fucking wait for this to go on
[1:31:56] <+metzselaar> Hey, shes a GILF
[1:31:57] <Blank9> she's pretty hot
[1:32:01] <dukenux> If you're a communist cop, maybe she can become your Engels
[1:32:02] <heemwizard> also with enough authority you can bring down the debt to 30
[1:32:25] <GarbageNirvana> she reminds me of someone
[1:32:26] <%X2Eliah> BOMBED OUT BUILDINGS
[1:32:45] <GarbageNirvana> like not Judy dench but Judi dench adjacent
[1:32:53] <derap41> Little bit  Fascist here
[1:32:53] <+Kataguro> Joyce is actually based.  She just works for assholes
[1:32:58] <DSD24> See I never put points in Shivers so this is fun
[1:33:01] <Hydrapissed> to give u shivers
[1:33:04] <%krispen_wa> joyce is...a complicated character
[1:33:07] <iacus_> *you shiver*
[1:33:12] <%X2Eliah> @WoolieVersus Revachol East is not under coalition, and thrives; Martinaise is under coalition and is a dump
[1:33:13] <sushahana> based nationalist liberal
[1:33:18] <derap41> BIG fascists here

[1:33:40] <dukenux> The Patriots
[1:33:44] <Hydrapissed> spiteful as FOOK
[1:33:48] <Zomner> Joyce is my favorite character because of SPOILERS
[1:33:48] <LunarRemix> Love for Revachol
[1:33:52] <Inqy833> Joyce is far enough up the capitalist totem pole that she can be honest about who she is and what she wants. So she doesn't self-deceive in the same way a lot of the other right-wing NPCs do.
[1:33:52] <+rusefus> Joyce partied back in the day
[1:33:57] <CatRidder> big merica

[1:36:04] <CatRidder> the french mafia
[1:36:04] <sushahana> the hustler king
[1:36:05] <miucsa51> THAT'S EXPLAINS ALOT
[1:36:05] <derap41> Big brain
[1:36:19] <%nicversus> a place called the cock and bull got dicked out of its original location by shithead land mogul
[1:36:25] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Omg my town does this and it‚Äôs awful
[1:36:25] <lyzejag> The sidewalk restaurants thing are so fucking annoying for wheelchair btw, a real nightmare
[1:36:39] <%cobalt_phoenix_> WHAT
[1:36:40] <ToxInjection> I feel like Montreal would piss me off if I ever decided to visit
[1:36:42] <dukenux> DAMN
[1:36:42] <derap41> Cheaper than rent
[1:36:49] <%X2Eliah> That's so fucked up but also makes sense
[1:36:54] <Hydrapissed> LAND is a business lol
[1:36:57] <Lelfro> sounds like a hustle
[1:37:03] <%cobalt_phoenix_> i kinda can't be that mad it's kinda smart
[1:37:11] <dukenux> This is like an advanced version of parking meter fairy
[1:37:13] <+Hayajin_> it was already impossible
[1:37:14] <Inqy833> And hey presto, a fine magically changes into a tax.
[1:37:14] <+Prevot> *taps forehead*
[1:37:18] <sushahana> quite an INDIRECT mode of taxation that is
[1:37:20] <+Hayajin_> without paying anyway
[1:37:20] <%X2Eliah> And that's what leads to fucked up parking fees and in city congestions
[1:37:23] <%nicversus> THINK MONTREAL THINK
[1:37:27] <aewheros> Well, it's sort of like paying rent. But totally a hustle.
[1:37:27] <dukenux> screw rules, i have MONEY
[1:37:31] <aiutare47> sounds like a racket, especially if you have friends who sell parking
[1:37:40] <QuicksilverMachine> that sounds like "the city doesnt care" is the problem
[1:37:40] <twoto858> No matter what kind of economic system, these people will figure out how to make the most money
[1:37:59] <+MrAtheGreat> LittleKuriboh was dead the hell on with that Kaiba line
[1:38:01] <CatRidder> this is mine
[1:38:04] <dukenux> That's why the scalpers can scalps
[1:38:07] <%X2Eliah> DESTROY ALL CARS
[1:38:08] <derap41> Same thing with Million Dollar fines for billion dollar profits
[1:38:10] <%jinking79> and he want ine slot machine
[1:38:18] <Ids560> yeah systems that let people do that are bad systems
[1:38:20] <dukenux> as long as they don't hurt the bottom line, no one will stop them
[1:38:34] <%nicversus> though in fairness, inner cities need more pedestrian exclusive spaces
[1:38:38] <dukenux> Art Nouveau is old too
[1:38:53] <Inqy833> Land ownership is an illusion like that.
[1:38:53] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:38:54] <lyzejag> "Noveau" ? Is it not supposed to be "Nouveau" ?

[2:00:21] <Fuji808> A fog of war that never goes away.
[2:00:22] <%Javaa01> Like that statue
[2:00:27] <%wolfofsound> like outlands but with the pale in between
[2:00:28] <%hax_metatron> DISCO
[2:00:29] <aewheros> We're still orbiting the sun. The pale orbits along with us.
[2:00:29] <+choopercabra> Islands floating in a cloudy void
[2:00:30] <+Jiggisnipe> think Kotor maybe
[2:00:30] <$lumporr> like there's no "above" to view from
[2:00:30] <derap41> Look up Hyperbolic Geometry
[2:00:31] <%kyh9> A shattered disco ball
[2:00:34] <%kyh9> OH SHIT
[2:00:36] <%kyh9> REGGIE
[2:00:36] <Lelfro> someone put points in conceptionalization
[2:00:37] <dukenux> In Planescape the city was a disk on top of a giant needle, and there was no sun
[2:00:40] <UvBenServed> Disco planet cracking
[2:00:41] <gecomaman> For sure Woolie
[2:00:42] <%X2Eliah> @WoolieVersus Yep, but you cannot see from one bit to another
[2:00:42] <bonebagMEL> YO Reggie!
[2:00:43] <%kyh9> REGGIE WITH THE 16 CONCEPTUALIZATION
[2:00:44] <%SainEdge> big brain Reggie!
[2:00:45] <defaultname3887> DISCOOO
[2:00:47] <%chandlerofearth> Holy shit
[2:00:49] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @alpharius88 yeah but with the pale between the land/water masses
[2:00:51] <sushahana> VERY HARDCORE
[2:00:51] <lyzejag> DISCO, BABY
[2:00:52] <%kyh9> I NEER PUT THAT TOGETHER
[2:00:53] <DSD24> Like that Statue of that King earlier?
[2:00:53] <miucsa51> REGGIE
[2:00:55] <zanzibarian_hamster> Not antimatter, pure entropy
[2:00:55] <Johannen> Reggie succeded a conceptualization check)
[2:00:56] <%krispen_wa> would it even be endless darkness? how does one imagine...nothing?
[2:00:57] <Zomner> I thought it was what the image of Inland Empire represented
[2:00:57] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Sonic unleashed planet when it explodes
[2:00:57] <thebalticguy1> IMPOSSIBLE CONCEPTUALIZATION CHECK
[2:01:00] <+Jiggisnipe> Reggie is smart
[2:01:00] <miucsa51> BURN BABY BURN
[2:01:00] <DelgotHansto> Same
[2:01:02] <%HeroToxiko> Oh like the ending of the old hitchhikers guide tv series
[2:01:02] <defaultname3887> does woolie know about the tittle screen?
[2:01:02] <+DakotaMacDoodle> Galaxy brain Reggie
[2:01:05] <gecomaman> How FUCKING cool is this game!
[2:01:07] <$hattrick61> Conceptualization Legendary: SUCCESS
[2:01:08] <+babyacid> holy shit...like the statue...
[2:01:18] <Hydrapissed> ITS disco baby grooovy
[2:01:27] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> it's DISCO, baby

[2:01:34] <+Kataguro> Brutal
[2:01:35] <+Hayajin_> before it existed
[2:01:35] <derap41> Disco is Disco
[2:01:37] <miucsa51> DISCO DISCOVERY
[2:01:38] <lyzejag> It's perfect
[2:01:39] <%hax_metatron> BUT ITS ALSO A LITERAL DISCO BALL PLANET
[2:01:39] <%X2Eliah> yeah!
[2:01:40] <+Prevot> disco af
[2:01:40] <iacus_> it's more disco than metal tbh
[2:01:42] <dbag202> So Disco
[2:01:43] <yomamma133713> honestly disco is better
[2:01:43] <ToxInjection> Disco, baby! Lose your being in the Pale!
[2:01:44] <dukenux> it's too melancholic to be metal
[2:01:44] <%illtima> illtima subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! Kiki KK.kkomoiijjkikkijium uooi in is at jn be in NJJM join I'm getting reiady uuin

[2:01:46] <+Kataguro> Hip-Hop Elysium
[2:01:48] <SomeAsianDood> disco though
[2:01:48] <gecomaman> Metal Elysium
[2:01:48] <neostria> nature is disco
[2:01:49] <$lumporr> Now THAT'S Hip Hop!
[2:01:53] <ulcaban> Shattered World
[2:01:54] <%Mathochism> THAT'S SO AUDITORY CONCEPT
[2:01:55] <%X2Eliah> That's hip"
[2:01:59] <$lumporr> @gecomaman strong
[2:02:00] <derap41> Hyperbolic Geometry
[2:02:00] <UvBenServed> "The most K-pop thing you'll ever see"
[2:02:02] <shakespearo> That's so Math Rock
[2:02:04] <%nicversus> what are we some kind of Disco Elysium?
[2:02:08] <ulcaban> Punk rock, maybe?
[2:02:10] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> that's so emo
[2:02:10] <aewheros> A parallel reality where disco is cool
[2:02:14] <%X2Eliah> !!!!!!
[2:02:17] <+Mendin> Physics stops working? Naw, LANGUAGE AND MATH STOP
[2:02:17] <gecomaman> @lumporr Sounds like a survival game
[2:02:22] <%Sunriser41> math stops working
[2:02:25] <%X2Eliah> PHYSICS STOPS
[2:02:27] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> numbers STOP WORKING
[2:02:27] <%Sunriser41> the number barrier!
[2:02:33] <+Mendin> That's like a level DEEPER than Physics
[2:02:33] <%cobalt_phoenix_> nothing works
[2:02:34] <%hax_metatron> BECAUSE ITS SUCH COMMON KNOWLEDGE
[2:02:34] <ToxInjection> NotLikeThis I've beaten this game, and I still don't know what the fuck that means
[2:02:34] <%kyh9> HE KNOWS
[2:02:35] <derap41> This might all be Bullshit
[2:02:35] <+Kataguro> You learn this in school in this setting
[2:02:37] <lyzejag> He doesn't want to be reminded, again
[2:02:37] <sendart> Kim doesn't want to think about this shit
[2:02:38] <laserbeaming> there's reason
[2:02:38] <neostria> 2 + 2 = ??????
[2:02:38] <ToxInjection> HOW DO NUMBERS STOP WORKING
[2:02:39] <begemp> He's worried about you
[2:02:39] <heemwizard> oh its real
[2:02:40] <+rusefus> Kims a police officer
[2:02:40] <Inqy833> Existentialism is a trip
[2:02:40] <shakespearo> Kim does NOT want you to know for fear of freaking out I think
[2:02:40] <%X2Eliah> @WoolieVersus IT IS REAL
[2:02:40] <$lumporr> HE DOESN'T THINK YOU CAN HANDLE IT
[2:02:41] <%xcompleasedad> YOU WILL GET THE ANSWER
[2:02:42] <sushahana> common knowladge
[2:02:42] <%Javaa01> Kim doesn't want it to set in
[2:02:43] <+choopercabra> He doesn't want to think about it
[2:02:43] <LunarRemix> Everyone who lives in this world is probably tired of this
[2:02:43] <Project205> He will tell you later
[2:02:44] <derap41> Shit could be Crack toughts
[2:02:44] <%hax_metatron> ITS LIKE WAKINGN UP AND FREAKING OUT ABOUT GLOBAL WARMING
[2:02:44] <+SammyOVision> Kim doesn't want you to break down
[2:02:44] <%kyh9> It's REALLY basic
[2:02:44] <pi_in_the_sci> Don't think about it
[2:02:44] <%Frostilk> Just ask later
[2:02:47] <%Sunriser41> its elementary school
[2:02:48] <DSD24> You asked him to leave
[2:02:50] <%justcallmebobplease> He doesn't want a rehash of horror-knowledge
[2:02:50] <%X2Eliah> @WoolieVersus KIM IS WORRIED ABOUT YOU
[2:02:51] <+JustBlubs> Existential Dread
[2:02:52] <%kyh9> Elementary school shit
[2:02:53] <miucsa51> YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH
[2:02:54] <Hydrapissed> cause u both SOUND insane
[2:02:54] <stormhawk9891> Cause it's common knowledge
[2:02:55] <Johannen> KIm is 100 logical...it might be to hard for him to comprehend
[2:02:56] <Eger007> he's scared?
[2:02:56] <$lumporr> @hax_metatron nailed it
[2:02:56] <Chatterbox1991> you'll see in about a minute
[2:02:57] <%wolfofsound> Guys he'll get to that
[2:02:57] <%xcompleasedad> She will talk about this in a bit
[2:03:00] <aewheros> Kim doesn't want YOU to have all this heaped upon your fragile mind
[2:03:01] <%Sunriser41> this is basic woolie
[2:03:02] <yomamma133713> its literally the apocalypse, obviously he doesnt want to talk about it
[2:03:03] <+Mr_Pylon> You'll see
[2:03:03] <dukenux> I wouldn't be surprised if the idea of Pale makes him incredibly uncomfortablwe
[2:03:03] <$hattrick61> Litterally dont let it set in
[2:03:04] <+Jiggisnipe> maybe you can ask him later
[2:03:04] <DSD24> Don't forget you had that Medical Episode
[2:03:06] <%Irridium> He may not want you learning about this and having an existential crisis
[2:03:06] <%kyh9> It's the most basic shit
[2:03:06] <SomeAsianDood> doesn't want u to break your mind over this shit
[2:03:12] <ingman112> We‚Äôll get to that
[2:03:12] <CatRidder> he doesnt wanna think about this
[2:03:12] <%X2Eliah> this is 100% real
[2:03:13] <%hax_metatron> Kim: Don't let it set in
[2:03:15] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> it's because everyone knows this and you're clearly not exactly a stable individual lol @woolieversus
[2:03:16] <miucsa51> DON'T LET IT SET IN
[2:03:16] <gecomaman> He tried to stop you talking about this twice, three times actually
[2:03:17] <%Sunriser41> pale is the setting in made manifest
[2:03:18] <nakunattakage> chat he'll figure it all out in like 10 minutes just chill LUL
[2:03:18] <Inqy833> It's like not wanting to hear about global warming... if global warming had manifested as a mysterious void-force that had already shattered the world.
[2:03:18] <%dalmek> you DID pass out reading a note in your ledger
[2:03:20] <+MrAtheGreat> Kim didn't want YOU to hear it, because he didn't think you could stand it. @WoolieVersus
[2:03:21] <Robot_Nixon_> Hey kids, entropy is upon us NotLikeThis
[2:03:23] <dukenux> Kim don't want to set it in. He's too much of a realist
[2:03:24] <$ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> He knows and does not need to think about it all the time
[2:03:26] <%kyh9> Everyone knows this stuff.  He didn't want Harry to know
[2:03:26] <zanzibarian_hamster> Not everyone wants to talk about how the true vacuum can happen at any moment and just fucking destroy the universe, it's a pretty heavy concept
[2:03:30] <Asuterisuku> It's now after midnight, but it still says Day 1.
[2:03:31] <shakespearo> Kim fails to see how you learning about the existential dread inherent to the world will aid the investigation, infact he think it will hinder it
[2:03:32] <Karhax> Can't let it set in
[2:03:33] <%justcallmebobplease> Kim was protecting your broken, busted ass.
[2:03:33] <%kyh9> He was afraid Harry wouldn't be able to handle it
[2:03:39] <ToxInjection> what a bonkers fucking setting. So cool.
[2:03:39] <@Solidus_113> it's not the investigation
[2:03:39] <+Vivaciousx3> it's alike learning about space for the first time
[2:03:40] <+ALazo> maybe he doesn't want you to have a meltdown when you learn about the basic nature of the universe
[2:03:41] <aiutare47> Wools you had a heart attack from remembering your near past, the entropy of the universe would be too much for healthy folks
[2:03:45] <andre11dr> I'm surprised that Woolie trusts her this much
[2:03:49] <+SammyOVision> He was afraid of your reaction
[2:03:50] <+Sunriser41> with the pale you dont have an option of not letting it set in
[2:03:53] <AvroEltz> Maybe joyce will give you a reason, speak to her maybe
[2:03:54] <derap41> I mean imagine if she tried to explain SpaceTime
[2:04:03] <andre11dr> she could just be nuts for all you know
[2:04:07] <Indigo_Automaton> WARP TRAVEL
[2:04:08] <derap41> that wouldn't be very believable either
[2:04:08] <$lumporr> oh man it's about to get HARD TO THINK ABOUT
[2:04:10] <dukenux> wormholes?
[2:04:10] <Hydrapissed> wtf warp speed
[2:04:12] <%krispen_wa> FORCE DIMENSIONS
[2:04:13] <gunsrlove> Wait, Measurehead also mentioned the Pale
[2:04:13] <Ids560> the teenager at the Frittte knew about this
[2:04:14] <%HeroToxiko> HMMMMMMM
[2:04:23] <%hax_metatron> WARP DIMENSIONS
[2:04:25] <sushahana> no
[2:04:26] <aewheros> The Pale is not vacuum. It's another kind of of non-matter.
[2:04:26] <Asuterisuku> If you can store music on a compact disc, why can't you store a person on one?
[2:04:27] <SpartanAltego> Kim probably doesn't want to hear about it because it's existentially terrifying.
[2:04:27] <Inqy833> Radiowaves force time and distance upon the Pale.
[2:04:28] <SomeAsianDood> hmmmmm
[2:04:28] <$lumporr> no
[2:04:29] <DatAsuna> no
[2:04:30] <begemp> no
[2:04:30] <dbag202> WARP?
[2:04:31] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> no
[2:04:31] <derap41> hmmm nah
[2:04:32] <%X2Eliah> kinda
[2:04:32] <ToxInjection> Kinda reminds me of the Mass Effect in Mass Effect
[2:04:33] <+RoByte2> Make sure you don't lose those Gellar fields
[2:04:40] <CatRidder> no
[2:04:40] <lol_red_ranger> Chronoptic energy bursts from one plane to the other, evaporating anything it touches.
[2:04:41] <DSD24> I saw Interstellar though it did something similar
[2:04:44] <EternalJedi> shortedt way from point A to B is folding the map
[2:04:45] <pi_in_the_sci> Projecting meaning onto the pale make it more real
[2:04:46] <DatAsuna> That's just wormhole explanations

[2:04:57] <%kyh9> OH YEAH
[2:04:58] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> you're applying radio waves to the pale to make it smaller to travel
[2:04:58] <$lumporr> YEAHYEAHYEAGH
[2:05:00] <DatAsuna> this is more like squeezing the paper like an accordian
[2:05:02] <DSD24> Oh yeah you feel nothing

[2:05:11] <%krispen_wa> THE PAST
[2:05:12] <$lumporr> THE PALE IS ALL THAT IS FORGOTTEN
[2:05:12] <derap41> I think they're just need to bring more lemons

[2:05:15] <%X2Eliah> time x space

[2:07:06] <Hydrapissed> her BRAIN huge
[2:07:09] <aiutare47> trained
[2:07:09] <%krispen_wa> SHE'S LITERALLY INSANE
[2:07:11] <thebalticguy1> ALMOST A MONTH
[2:07:14] <$hattrick61> A wrinkle in time, thats what it was
[2:07:17] <aiutare47> you can train for it
[2:07:17] <%wolfofsound> @krispen_wa well
[2:07:18] <SomeAsianDood> she's going INSANE
[2:07:20] <$lumporr> joyce is the coolest
[2:07:21] <%nicversus> "Hey lady, my name is Harry... I think"
[2:07:25] <derap41> Greeks
[2:07:27] <%JustToWatch> The area between the pale and the real world is called a porch collapse, and porches are usually in the back of the house, looking onto THE BACKYARD
[2:07:30] <DSD24> Woolie is going Beyond the Pale right now
[2:07:35] <mr_sups> @hattrick61 Oh my god!
[2:07:42] <%Sunriser41> this earth is not flat, because flat is a meaniless concept in the pale
[2:07:46] <Hydrapissed> I mean arnt we all
[2:07:47] <+projectmanatees> shes better than us
[2:07:47] <lyzejag> She is but also maybe, not
[2:07:47] <+Jiggisnipe> or is she the most reliable?
[2:07:47] <heemwizard> yep
[2:07:48] <$lumporr> i mean
[2:07:50] <%HeroToxiko> OOOP
[2:07:51] <bobdoletrasher> @WoolieVersus pale blue ocean?
[2:07:51] <DSD24> She's trained for it though
[2:07:54] <iacus_> Logic: FAIL
[2:07:54] <derap41> but if she is overexposed that means its real
[2:07:55] <Ids560> well she's not reliable because she's rich
[2:07:57] <Asuterisuku> Possibly with extensive brain damage
[2:07:59] <begemp> Or she has MAX insight
[2:08:00] <Robot_Nixon_> shes only slightly insane Kappa
[2:08:01] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> maybe she WANTS you to think she's overexposed
[2:08:01] <%kyh9> She's trained to handle it
[2:08:03] <%X2Eliah> oh jesus fuck woolie is gonna internalize this as flat earther bullshit and misread everything now
[2:08:06] <Lelfro> "you have first experience? not reliable"
[2:08:06] <%kyh9> She has 200 Volition
[2:08:06] <miucsa51> FRENZY
[2:08:06] <+MrAtheGreat> She is both the most anbd leastg reliable person you know for info
[2:08:11] <$lumporr> @X2Eliah don't tempt fate
[2:08:12] <ToxInjection> Harry's not really one to lecture others on insanity.
[2:08:12] <thebalticguy1> Shes Pale exposed for a near month, yet shes the most sane person you've met yet
[2:08:12] <DatAsuna> She's not reliable because she's an ultraliberal boat owner, not cause of the pale
[2:08:17] <%krispen_wa> ever wonder why the ultraliberal would be so supportive of the revolution?
[2:08:17] <%kyh9> like infinite volition
[2:08:20] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> but yeah her insight stat is very high
[2:08:31] <Johannen> Woolie refuses to accept the Flat Earth Truth)
[2:08:33] <lyzejag> She's rich, and ultra, and the pale is the only thing that makes her not good ? She's been dubious since the beggining
[2:08:36] <%alpharius88> Sound something you should need a "gallagher field" form warhammer
[2:08:37] <%HeroToxiko> Is that what we call an unreliable narrator?
[2:08:43] <dukenux> She's insane because of the Pale, and that invalidates the Pale??
[2:08:54] <elshadow7> 6000 years of no progress
[2:08:57] <gunsrlove> @alpharius88  Geller field*
[2:08:59] <%wolfofsound> I love that chat has insight on her that's different than others based on choices, this game is nuts
[2:09:01] <skunk1324> Shes a representative of a company that makes billions
[2:09:05] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> she also said living in the same time is more relatable than your economic or social status, so there's that
[2:09:06] <andre11dr> So what we learned here is that Woolie could be turned into a flat earther more easily than you thought Kappa
[2:09:07] <+MrAtheGreat> Ew is Woolie one of those crazy ROUND earthers?
[2:09:09] <$lumporr> @dukenux ah yes. perfect sense sbfpSetIn sbfpSetIn
[2:09:10] <%Sunriser41> the "far pale"
[2:09:15] <+Kataguro> Flying just makes it a lot faster
[2:09:15] <Inqy833> An object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by another force.
[2:09:17] <%X2Eliah> yes
[2:09:20] <%X2Eliah> inertia
[2:09:20] <%kyh9> You have to stay on the 'shallow' end of the pale
[2:09:21] <+Jiggisnipe> @dukenux lol yea Woolie's logic kinda falls apart
[2:09:23] <derap41> Hyperbolic Geometry Earth
[2:09:32] <$lumporr> THEY GET EATEN BY THE PAST
[2:09:33] <DSD24> Lost in the Pale
[2:09:34] <Inqy833> Isaac muvverfuggin Newton baby.
[2:09:34] <kikoeru_san> Oh shit Woolie talking bout the Pale
[2:09:34] <Hydrapissed> Bermedua triangle
[2:09:36] <%kyh9> You'd just disappear
[2:09:38] <EternalJedi> YEET
[2:09:39] <kikoeru_san> Hell yeah
[2:09:42] <iacus_> eppic ...
[2:09:43] <%X2Eliah> yep
[2:09:44] <%cobalt_phoenix_> anyone would die
[2:09:45] <dukenux> in many ways Pale is just like space
[2:09:46] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> you'd be fried immediately
[2:09:46] <+Fnir> Ow ! Is it like the Earthsea ends of the ocean ?

[2:11:42] <Johannen> Unknown rate is the scary part
[2:11:46] <dukenux> yeah like the universe
[2:11:46] <%wolfofsound> I'd drink myself into sleep every day too

[2:12:07] <heemwizard> climate change doesnt compare
[2:12:08] <%krispen_wa> @reallybigrocks if the rate changes by the second then the rate is immeasurable
[2:12:08] <Darren716> boo
[2:12:09] <Hydrapissed> global warming
[2:12:11] <DSD24> @DeepSearch27 Remember that Harry here just had a really bad medical episode
[2:12:12] <Johannen> @ReallyBigRocks It is happening and you can probe it but the speed of it is not consistnent
[2:12:14] <%kyh9> DONT LET IT SET IN
[2:12:14] <%X2Eliah> Aand there is why Kim stepped away

[2:12:29] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> this is if global warming sent to Venus levels bad
[2:12:29] <+babyacid> kim knows but its a bummer to talk about
[2:12:30] <%kyh9> Do not let it set in

[2:12:58] <+Vivaciousx3> its fine
[2:13:00] <Darren716> Apoco cop answer
[2:13:01] <laserbeaming> it would have been the same dialogue
[2:13:01] <%kyh9> It was Apocalypse cop
[2:13:02] <aewheros> The Universe? Have we observed Pale in outer space?
[2:13:04] <%cobalt_phoenix_> nah it's fine
[2:13:04] <%DiscoMatador> Its fine
[2:13:05] <%justcallmebobplease> It was Apoc Cop

[2:14:21] <aiutare47> how could you not?
[2:14:31] <+Jiggisnipe> disco baby
[2:14:32] <skunk1324> 2
[2:14:33] <%superc37> @aiutare47 but there are stars right? constellations? and a sun? how tf can there be no outer space if all that exists
[2:14:35] <+OblivionSword1> it's DISCO
[2:14:36] <%wolfofsound> 6 LUL
[2:14:37] <EternalJedi> considering how long they've been studying the Pale, apparently this IS elementary school stuff
[2:14:38] <%HeroToxiko> I mean, Harry was a cop so he wouldn't be interested in stuff like this LUL
[2:14:38] <SomeAsianDood> 6666
[2:14:38] <+MrAtheGreat> 9 CHOICES
[2:14:38] <lyzejag> 555555555
[2:14:39] <TrueSatanos> Joyce is insane and I love her
[2:14:40] <DSD24> I picked 4
[2:14:41] <heemwizard> 7
[2:14:43] <dbag202> 6
[2:14:44] <Darren716> Disco fever
[2:14:44] <+Mendin> Hey Woolie do you remember talking to an old lady lorry driver down in the bottom right corner?
[2:14:47] <andre11dr> Woolie definitely trusting her more than me
[2:14:53] <heemwizard> 8
[2:14:54] <ToxInjection> Fight the apocalypse with COMMUNISM.
[2:14:54] <Robot_Nixon_> 5 KKomrade
[2:14:55] <+MrAtheGreat> COMMUNISM WILLS SAVE US LUL
[2:14:58] <%krispen_wa> 4 is...very optimistic
[2:14:58] <%Irridium> LUL
[2:14:59] <ingman112> @mendin he‚Äôll get there, he‚Äôs got the Joyce quest
[2:15:00] <+Prevot> 5 and 6 LUL
[2:15:04] <derap41> Entropy doesn't care about Ideology
[2:15:04] <TrueSatanos> It's Disco, baby
[2:15:08] <munitalprats> DISCO
[2:15:09] <Darren716> 2222
[2:15:09] <aewheros> @aewheros It's true they haven't reached upper orbit. But I think this world is supposed to be a planet. Just fractured by "the pale".
[2:15:10] <dukenux> the options 5 to 7 are a joke
[2:15:11] <Inqy833> The heat death fo the universe is most un-liberal.
[2:15:11] <%hax_metatron> I KNEW WOOLIE WOULD PICK 8
[2:15:17] <%alpharius88> Iam in day 3 and i didnt  get all of this!!! THIS GAME RULES
[2:15:19] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> It is absolutely disco
[2:15:21] <+metzselaar> 4 is mine
[2:15:26] <lyzejag> I think i would just vomit
[2:15:31] <+Jeshk0> Its discco
[2:15:31] <aiutare47> @superc37 How can there be matter at all? how is there gravity? I have no clue, but the talk of the balloons makes me thing these are spheres of reality floating in the Pale
[2:15:31] <%xcompleasedad> The fact that 5 KINDA works, based on the Spirit Quest, is NUTS to me
[2:15:32] <Zomner> would collapse
[2:15:34] <$lumporr> i'd want to see it
[2:15:34] <sporeian94> Literally Climate Change
[2:15:36] <DSD24> I picked 4 cause I'd like to be optimistic
[2:15:39] <%wolfofsound> I'd go find those drugs
[2:15:39] <+Bitscreed> I went with 4 myself
[2:15:40] <$hattrick61> of to drink
[2:15:40] <Eger007> it's kinda enthropy death
[2:15:41] <mr_sups> -2 Morale
[2:15:41] <Hydrapissed> 2
[2:15:42] <%Sunriser41> i would just take a boat and go into the pale, fuck it
[2:15:45] <dukenux> I mean this is all a question of WHEN it will happen
[2:15:47] <+Prevot> LUL
[2:15:47] <Johannen> It is Disco baby
[2:15:48] <%cobalt_phoenix_> LUL
[2:15:48] <Fuji808> 2, 4, 8. We need an Option 10 where we vomit in terror.

[2:16:04] <OverlordedK> What game does he think he's playing LUL
[2:16:07] <Lelfro> what if it's a satire answer to cope?
[2:16:12] <Inqy833> The personal is political.

[2:16:24] <lyzejag> No politics is obviously no politcs it's so easy
[2:16:26] <bonebagMEL> Oh, I just got it. Pale is global warming...
[2:16:26] <+Jeshk0> only communism can save us from the Pale!
[2:16:27] <linSP> ‚Äúthe pale? It was the damn liberals!‚Äù
[2:16:27] <derap41> entropy doesn't care about politics
[2:16:29] <ingman112> Politics is the biggest of all coping mechanisms
[2:16:29] <CatRidder> centrist
[2:16:29] <TrueSatanos> But the pale literally is political. The entire game is politics.
[2:16:30] <Parapattern> It's Disco BABEY
[2:16:34] <iacus_> unilaterally cutting a person out of your life for that?
[2:16:36] <$hattrick61> "Hey man this apocalypse thing is gonna be bad for the polls."

[2:19:10] <derap41> Kim looking out for you all the time
[2:19:11] <Ids560> no Raphael this time, they passed that check

[2:19:19] <gecomaman> 2222
[2:19:21] <dbag202> Kim was worried about you
[2:19:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> Very real possibility given your reaction to other things lol
[2:19:22] <+MrAtheGreat> and hey, why did the old you get so screwed up in the first place?
[2:19:25] <%wolfofsound> It's REAL WOOLIE
[2:19:26] <Johannen> HIT me Up, More Reality Drug
[2:19:32] <derap41> This is basic Spacetime
[2:19:33] <%Sunriser41> so its all true woolie
[2:19:34] <Inqy833> Well yeah I mean Kim did just have to resuscitate you after a panic attack.
[2:19:34] <%SirGO0SE> confirmation of it being real
[2:19:34] <+RoByte2> You fainted reading a letter you tossed in the garbage, do you blame him?
[2:19:35] <lyzejag> Now you *know*
[2:19:36] <+Jeshk0> "yo kim, youve heard of the Pale?? shits wild!"
[2:19:40] <%nicversus> I may not be completely on her side politically, but she is really cool. Cool enough to set aside any political gripes.
[2:19:41] <DSD24> @MrAtheGreat I think it was the Alcoholism
[2:19:47] <Kyuseishun> 2
[2:19:50] <yomamma133713> not done
[2:19:50] <TrueSatanos> The Pale changes literally everything you think about the game. It's amazing.
[2:19:55] <stormhawk9891> You can come back later
[2:19:59] <%cobalt_phoenix_> APOCALYPSE
[2:20:02] <shakespearo> @Jeshk0 like telling your coworker "YO did you know there is space??"
[2:20:02] <$hattrick61> You DID pass out from your paperwork, it was a reasonable concern
[2:20:02] <+ALazo> right on cue
[2:20:04] <munitalprats> COPOCALYPSE
[2:20:05] <gecomaman> What a game. Holy shit
[2:20:05] <+Prevot> perfect timing

[2:20:05] <+OblivionSword1> GREAT TIMING
[2:20:06] <%Frostilk> fitting
[2:20:07] <%krispen_wa> TOPICAL
[2:20:07] <+Mendin> Joyce is astoundingly nice and friendly for a ruthless arch-capitalist
[2:20:07] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> she's a really well written character, but who isn't in this game?
[2:20:08] <hungryhannya> perfect timing
[2:20:11] <skunk1324> those buffs tough
[2:20:11] <Darren716> YEssss
[2:20:11] <%SirGO0SE> @nicversus i want her to bake me cookies and give me grandma kissies

[2:20:23] <iacus_> oh that's a cool effect. my 2 favorite skills
[2:20:23] <+Bitscreed> Do not think about The Event.
[2:20:28] <Lelfro> there's a hidden bonus to this one, not written
[2:20:30] <DSD24> Look at those learning caps
[2:20:34] <%krispen_wa> @mendin capital wears a nice face, but takes it off only when it commits atrocity
[2:20:37] <TrueSatanos> Apocalypse Cops literally makes complete sense once you know about The Pale.
[2:20:37] <andre11dr> Good timing on this
[2:20:38] <%nicversus> @SirGO0SE lmao that would be nice
[2:20:39] <Darren716> It's not the end of the world, but you can see it from here
[2:20:41] <%Koopardon> 6/5 for this playthough ngl

[2:20:54] <%X2Eliah> Yeah
[2:20:54] <derap41> That did  almost nothing for you
[2:20:54] <he1lhydra> "rolled back"? sajamSegue3 sajamSegue4
[2:20:56] <%X2Eliah> the pale
[2:20:56] <CatRidder> fighting game with roll back

[2:21:15] <shakespearo> Check the bookstore for more info on The Pale
[2:21:16] <+ReallyBigRocks> fog of war is GROWING
[2:21:17] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> I think his shivers cap was already 6 tho
[2:21:19] <+Bitscreed> Oooh Shivers AND Inland Empire raised? Perfect
[2:21:20] <%X2Eliah> Woolie has understood it completely and Reggie is just blocking it out xDS
[2:21:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> SWELLING
[2:21:21] <derap41> that was pretty useless
[2:21:23] <ingman112> So you can now dump hobocop if need be, b/c your shivers cap is up to 6
[2:21:27] <bobdoletrasher> @WoolieVersus sounds like dementia
[2:21:31] <UvBenServed> The fog of war is an environmental hazard
[2:21:31] <bonebagMEL> The world is Styrofoam floating in a sea of gasoline
[2:21:33] <Blank9> your stat caps were already pretty high
[2:21:35] <aewheros> look at all those diamonds
[2:21:35] <laserbeaming> it's a cool thought for a first playthrough
[2:21:38] <Inqy833> @krispen_wa I think Joyce is a bit more than that. She's not putting on an act, and that's what makes her so fascinating and charming. It's just that what she says it totally insane and treats people as abstracts.
[2:21:39] <%PMAvers> Well, our learning cap for Shivers was like 7, so not a whole lot.
[2:21:39] <munitalprats> now you can dump hobocop
[2:21:41] <andre11dr> The 2 most interesting stats
[2:21:42] <FassieFons> 4 points already
[2:21:44] <%nicversus> the human mind gets to experience what happens to the computer's memory every time you delete a file when it travels through the pale
[2:21:48] <Robot_Nixon_> @ingman112 thats heathen talk üò° hobo for life
[2:21:50] <UvBenServed> LUL

[2:22:16] <yomamma133713> thoughts are always nice
[2:22:17] <andre11dr> Oh yeah, this is still day 1 btw LUL
[2:22:18] <munitalprats> TAX EVASION

[2:22:26] <+procrastiamus> get that commie shit in there baby
[2:22:27] <%cobalt_phoenix_> maybe wait for more thoughts
[2:22:31] <%krispen_wa> @nicversus more like being forced to look at all the internet articles of the past all at once
[2:22:37] <LegitBarnacleBoy> You no longer have the problem debuffs, those are temporary
[2:22:39] <+MrAtheGreat> You only get half the benefit of Apocoalypse Cop because of Hobhocop
[2:22:39] <Project205> White Mourning has a really cool solution
[2:22:40] <%X2Eliah> Problem debuff goes away
[2:22:41] <Lancaster_H> woolie the problem is temporary
[2:22:44] <heemwizard> you can forget that thought if u want
[2:22:44] <aiutare47> those are temporary
[2:22:45] <Indigo_Automaton> Debuffs are temporary
[2:22:48] <LegitBarnacleBoy> problem debuffs are already gone
[2:22:49] <dds333a> @krispen_wa absolute insanity in that
[2:22:52] <%X2Eliah> @Problem debuff is gone when completed
[2:22:53] <+Kataguro> The Problem is only while you're internalizing it
[2:22:53] <munitalprats> debuffs are temporary
[2:23:01] <andre11dr> Woolie my man ,you need some HUSTLE IN THIS BITCH
[2:23:03] <munitalprats> get rid of hobocop
[2:23:07] <munitalprats> BECOME HUSTLER
[2:23:07] <derap41> Hobo and Cop of the Apocalypse are neutralizing each other
[2:23:07] <+OblivionSword1> debuff are gone when you get the solution
[2:23:07] <+MrAtheGreat> nope. it's always a crap shoot
[2:23:12] <LegitBarnacleBoy> debuffs are gone
[2:23:22] <iacus_> Selfish request: Do White Mourning
[2:23:23] <%Arnoldoaad1> some solutions do have downsides
[2:23:28] <$hattrick61> White mourning is great storywise
[2:23:29] <Johannen> Just choose what sounds fun
[2:23:35] <Inqy833> White Mourning is awesome.
[2:23:40] <Zomner> I mean, they are perks
[2:23:43] <ingman112> Best way is to lean into thoughts that seem to complement your playstyle, and hope for the best
[2:23:43] <munitalprats> get rid of hobo
[2:23:43] <+MrAtheGreat> generally the cop ooption are the best ones, particularly Art Cop
[2:23:43] <primaryfire> I didn't much care for potentially throwing away a dozen points so I looked up the finished bonuses
[2:23:49] <yomamma133713> white mourning sounds important
[2:23:50] <Onamar> Apocalypse Cop + full Half-Light is really fun
[2:23:54] <Inqy833> Communism... won't make you a happy person.
[2:23:55] <%chandlerofearth> hobo gives them more money though
[2:23:56] <%JustToWatch> there's no reason to forget a thought until you have unlocked and filled out all of the thought slots
[2:23:57] <iacus_> get rid of shit compressor imo
[2:23:58] <heemwizard> no get rid of shit compressor
[2:24:01] <derap41> Communism is pretty boring
[2:24:02] <+IvesNapalm> Generally, unless you don't like something you opted into or you've used all thought slots, you don't want to remove a thought
[2:24:02] <TrueSatanos> Some solutions can be bad, but you've gotta take that mystery shot first to know.
[2:24:14] <munitalprats> BECOME HUSTLER
[2:24:16] <%krispen_wa> HUSTLE AND GRIND
[2:24:22] <dds333a> I just rolled with what I thought suited the investigation best my first playthrough LUL
[2:24:24] <heemwizard> you get a lot of money
[2:24:27] <derap41> cash money?
[2:24:28] <+MrAtheGreat> Don't get rid of shit always buy new cabinets first
[2:24:29] <%hax_metatron> $$$$$$
[2:24:31] <CatRidder> hustle and flow
[2:24:32] <Lelfro> dosh

[2:24:46] <+MrAtheGreat> That ones good
[2:24:47] <Asuterisuku> It's what you get to be not broke
[2:24:48] <TrueSatanos> 15th Indotribe is a pretty cool one.
[2:24:52] <dds333a> Needless to say, I rolled only with the boring thoughts
[2:24:53] <+babyacid> 15th endotribe is great if taken EARLY
[2:24:54] <%X2Eliah> INDOTRIBE IS GOOD
[2:24:55] <iacus_> fifteenth indotribe has a great lore payoff
[2:24:58] <%hax_metatron> It's about companies
[2:25:02] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> ohhhhh interesting
[2:25:04] <shakespearo> @Asuterisuku Nah that's Wompty Dompty
[2:25:06] <lyzejag> Almost 6H ?? Holy shit
[2:25:07] <%krispen_wa> 15th indotribe is good for gamifying the system
[2:25:09] <ingman112> You can always save the point too
[2:25:24] <laserbeaming> The Sadness Thought
[2:25:24] <derap41> White Mourning is realizing what happened
[2:25:31] <%kyh9> It's about corporations, not nations
[2:25:32] <Deasmeister> Existentialism
[2:25:33] <Blank9> I just maxed how many thoughts I could have, because they're as good as a level
[2:25:33] <+Kataguro> I think you can try the notebook again
[2:25:34] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> I like white mourning a lot Woolz, not gonna say why:)
[2:25:34] <depressioncherrie> important point: the political vision quest that was added in "The Final Cut" only triggers if you have one of the 4 political thoughts internalized. So you want at least one of them, possibly more to keep your options open...
[2:25:39] <munitalprats> get rid of hobocop
[2:25:41] <Inqy833> Advanced Race Theory... you know you want to.
[2:25:41] <%Javaa01> Both are very good
[2:25:41] <Lelfro> are you gonna dig back your bad past? at what cost
[2:25:41] <munitalprats> or shit compressors
[2:25:45] <iacus_> good picks
[2:25:48] <+MrAtheGreat> Cop thoughts are great, but Political thoughts are incredibly weak unless you commit to that Political alignment.
[2:25:48] <munitalprats> and just take both
[2:25:49] <heemwizard> @depressioncherrie this
[2:25:50] <derap41> Both are good
[2:25:53] <nakunattakage> removing a thought takes a skillpoint chat
[2:25:56] <Lancaster_H> white mourning is real good lore @WoolieVersus
[2:25:57] <zanzibarian_hamster> Shit compressor looks pretty useless
[2:25:58] <+babyacid> 15 indo FIRST then
[2:26:01] <primaryfire> theres a "where you come from" thought that acts as the opposite of hobocop but they're mutually exclusive
[2:26:04] <+ReallyBigRocks> Getting rid of a thought costs points, he'd rather get a new one right now
[2:26:05] <%Mathochism> Getting rid of shit means spending a point. He should just open up thoughts.
[2:26:10] <CatRidder> it a good one
[2:26:11] <iacus_> now there's literally no difference between unlocking and forgetting. no point in getting rid of anything
[2:26:11] <Asuterisuku> The Indotribe has no penalty and just takes time.
[2:26:18] <%X2Eliah> yeah for now its better to keep unlocking slots
[2:26:18] <+MrAtheGreat> NO
[2:26:18] <derap41> HoboCop and Cop of the Apocalypse are kinda doing the same thing
[2:26:20] <munitalprats> apparently dont pull one out
[2:26:23] <+OblivionSword1> not now
[2:26:24] <%JustToWatch> it cost a point to forget a thought
[2:26:24] <%X2Eliah> PULLING OUT COSTS
[2:26:24] <munitalprats> and just get a new one, is what people are saying
[2:26:25] <%cobalt_phoenix_> not until you're full
[2:26:26] <+Mendin> ta oŒªŒ±
[2:26:27] <nakunattakage> taking them out costs a skillpoint woolie
[2:26:28] <lyzejag> @depressioncherrie Oh really ? The, you can unlock the 4 quest at the same time ?
[2:26:28] <laserbeaming> forgetting costs points
[2:26:28] <+rusefus> better to just unlock more slots
[2:26:28] <oda_flobunaga> Can't now
[2:26:29] <+Kataguro> It takes a point to forget a thought.  You might as well just open up more slots instead
[2:26:33] <%Frostilk> Can't it cost points
[2:26:33] <%justcallmebobplease> Just unlock a new slot, don't waste points removing something
[2:26:33] <$hattrick61> pulling out costs pointa
[2:26:34] <thebalticguy1> Pulling out a thought costs a Point
[2:26:36] <pi_in_the_sci> dorgetrting and geaining a new slot cost the same
[2:26:37] <Indigo_Automaton> Never forget, just unlock a new slot
[2:26:37] <TrueSatanos> It costs the same to buy a new slot as it does to lose an old one, best to max out the cabinet.
[2:26:38] <CatRidder> you cant i take a point to forget
[2:26:40] <Inqy833> No real point taking stuff out till you've maxed out your cabinet.
[2:26:40] <+OblivionSword1> removing a thought is for later when you have no slots left
[2:26:41] <Blank9> only start forgetting when you can't keep any more thoughts
[2:26:43] <ingman112> That costs a point. Just go for the new slots
[2:26:43] <+babyacid> costs the same
[2:26:45] <derap41> Hobo is kinda useless if you don't use it
[2:26:47] <Deasmeister> costs point to forget
[2:26:50] <%justcallmebobplease> New slot is same cost as removing a thought, just open a new slot
[2:26:54] <%X2Eliah> KEEP JAMAIS VU ALWAYS
[2:26:54] <Lancaster_H> pulling out has no upside until you're full on slots, costs the same to open up a new one @WoolieVersus
[2:26:54] <%Javaa01> Can't be a pullout king without points
[2:26:56] <andre11dr> Does sleeping count towards the time for the thoughts?
[2:26:57] <%X2Eliah> EXP BIG
[2:26:57] <ingman112> You don‚Äôt need hobo and apocalypse both
[2:26:58] <aiutare47> Absolutely no reason to get rid of a thought before you hit the maximum thought cap
[2:27:00] <derap41> yes
[2:27:01] <%cobalt_phoenix_> just open new slots, if you run out then forget
[2:27:02] <%justcallmebobplease> YES
[2:27:04] <aiutare47> Yes
[2:27:04] <%X2Eliah> YES
[2:27:05] <Indigo_Automaton> YES
[2:27:06] <+rusefus> 100%
[2:27:07] <%DiscoMatador> ye
[2:27:07] <Johannen> Yes
[2:27:08] <Robot_Nixon_> What will you do with all your uncompressed shit though??
[2:27:11] <+babyacid> YES
[2:27:11] <andre11dr> Yep
[2:27:12] <derap41> UNless you get a terrible thought
[2:27:12] <%illtima> don't forget until all slots are full, yeah
[2:27:17] <thebalticguy1> yes, until you max out
[2:27:21] <oda_flobunaga> c'est vrais
[2:27:32] <iacus_> now go to bed ffs
[2:27:33] <+rusefus> pls sleep
[2:27:35] <%Frostilk> Unlock, max out, then forget and replace
[2:27:36] <oda_flobunaga> nein
[2:27:36] <lambishly> you CAN remove but it also takes a level pip
[2:27:39] <Johannen> BUG
[2:27:41] <%Javaa01> It's too late to talk to her
[2:27:45] <derap41> No sleep we've got mysteries to solve
[2:27:46] <%DiscoMatador> Bug
[2:27:48] <neostria> Kim needs sleep :(
[2:27:49] <yomamma133713> bug
[2:27:53] <gecomaman> Can you do anything with the body? If not then probably bedtime.
[2:27:55] <TrueSatanos> Joyce is someone you should check in with occasionally
[2:27:56] <heemwizard> @Javaa01 no you can still talk
[2:27:56] <+Mr_Pylon> Do the end of day debrief with Kim
[2:27:59] <+OblivionSword1> there is one esprit de corp white check
[2:28:00] <ingman112> Bedtime
[2:28:01] <Indigo_Automaton> Debrief and Sleep would be best
[2:28:02] <%X2Eliah> She is mostly done
[2:28:03] <heemwizard> just a bit bugged
[2:28:04] <Blank9> kim can talk to you at the inn

[2:28:19] <+MrAtheGreat> Always buy cabinets, only burn thoughts when they are useless/detrimental to you. Those points that get rid of thoughts are usually better spent on skills

[2:28:22] <+Kataguro> Hella dark
[2:28:26] <%hax_metatron> CUNO DOESNT SLEEP

[2:28:47] <%SirGO0SE> @WoolieVersus the image for Inland Empire might make you feel different than it did before
[2:28:49] <derap41> Meth keeps you up who knew

[2:29:08] <%Mathochism> Cuno Is Not Crash
[2:29:08] <Tennochief> DO NOT let Cunoesse into the pale

[2:29:49] <+MrAtheGreat> Maximizing is pointless. Game has no end date

[2:35:13] <+MrAtheGreat> Nah we get it. We never really bother with calling hungover people not sober
[2:35:20] <AvroEltz> I think it would be hard to shoot straight while hangover
[2:35:20] <%cobalt_phoenix_> lol yeah gotta get past measurehead
[2:35:20] <Inqy833> Well either way, people with a bad hangover probably shouldn't be trusted with loaded firearms.
[2:35:26] <%fetrigon> nah you're still fucked either way
[2:35:30] <dds333a> A metric fuckton of Alcohol and Heartbreak absolutely screwed him up
[2:35:35] <andre11dr> The hangover is the load bar for slobbering
[2:35:39] <Robot_Nixon_> it actually is amazing you can even get up after a 3 day drinking binge

[2:37:49] <Johannen> I feel like clothes were a late addition to the game, and there is a canon costume that you upgrade thruout  the game
[2:38:01] <Hydrapissed> hmmmmmmmmmmmm
[2:38:02] <+Kataguro> I like this system
[2:38:04] <Hydrapissed> thats a neat one
[2:38:05] <derap41> Sounds Fimiliar
[2:38:06] <+ThomasOfTroy> That's how it works IRL
[2:38:08] <%Deft_Thought> Man, I wish I had known that the devs partnered with a fashion company and were selling a version of Kim's jacket. Sold out crazy quick.
[2:38:10] <QuicksilverMachine> he means "do you want to pay 1000 fine or to give me 800"
[2:38:14] <%kyh9> Similar to real life
[2:38:17] <oda_flobunaga> very japanese
[2:38:18] <dukenux> that usually how it SHOULD work
[2:38:20] <derap41> This is how it works
[2:38:21] <%nicversus> that's what court dates are
[2:38:23] <%HeroToxiko> It's almost like cash bail is a scam
[2:38:23] <%kyh9> And then you CANT plead the fifth
[2:38:24] <Hydrapissed> how it should work lol
[2:38:26] <Asuterisuku> "Show up or lose the right to vote."
[2:38:28] <ToxInjection> Like court dates, but for everything.
[2:38:28] <munitalprats> that's what court dates
[2:38:28] <linSP> come to jail please
[2:38:28] <Inqy833> Yeah, there's plenty of countries that basically do that.
[2:38:29] <Lelfro> sorry, I overslept, guess I'm a fugitive
[2:38:29] <yomamma133713> court dates
[2:38:30] <zanzibarian_hamster> *Cough* social credit score *cough*
[2:38:30] <+ReallyBigRocks> Basically skipping the bail process
[2:38:31] <dukenux> it's default how it works here
[2:38:34] <%Arnoldoaad1> Thts not uncommon
[2:38:36] <mr_sups> Court date
[2:38:39] <%HeroToxiko> Not here we don't LUL
[2:38:40] <dds333a> It's up to you
[2:38:41] <Johannen> That is prety common
[2:38:42] <kikoeru_san> probably woulda stopped Freddy Gray from happening
[2:38:43] <derap41> the US loves that because it lets you pile on more shit
[2:38:45] <%X2Eliah> This is more extreme case than irl
[2:38:46] <%kyh9> lots of white collar crimes have that
[2:38:51] <Eger007> basically bailbonding in advance
[2:38:56] <dukenux> You get a court order, and if you don't show up, theyll bring you in in cuffs
[2:38:57] <CatRidder> rich people get that power
[2:39:03] <jorniev> yeah but this is to get arrested
[2:39:10] <derap41> pls don't shoot people
[2:39:11] <andre11dr> I think in certain countries arrests work like that
[2:39:12] <munitalprats> 'admonished'
[2:39:21] <+MrAtheGreat> we od that with immigrants. Those that apparently *have no reason to show up* according to old white fuck-ups
[2:39:33] <Mr_Zero5232> I guess like a court date, miss it if you want, but we comin for dat ass if ya do
[2:39:53] <derap41> @Mr_Zero5232 and we will take all your shit
[2:40:02] <%HeroToxiko> @kikoeru_san nah thats not how that works
[2:40:04] <+Kataguro> The RCM also isn't as big as a normal police department.  They don't have the manpower to do big arrests all the time
[2:40:23] <Hydrapissed> Hmmmmmmm
[2:40:29] <Hydrapissed> hmmmmmm
[2:40:35] <%wolfofsound> monkaS
[2:40:41] <dbag202> Set me free, she said
[2:40:43] <Mr_Zero5232> @derap41 well, nothing like a forfeit to hit home
[2:40:44] <Hydrapissed> monkaS
[2:40:47] <Hydrapissed> hmmm
[2:40:47] <Asuterisuku> Which is how it SHOULD be.
[2:40:48] <Johannen> She told me to "FREE HER" you saw it
[2:40:51] <derap41> mmhmm
[2:40:54] <AngryAsian5> SET ME FREE
[2:40:59] <Inqy833> The RCM has many problems but, well, they would not be solved by defunding. It's interesting.
[2:41:00] <%nicversus> @Johannen LUL
[2:41:04] <ToxInjection> Damn, Internal Affairs doing their job? A bit unrealistic there
[2:41:05] <derap41> Guy Woolie Cowarded out

[2:41:43] <%X2Eliah> So it's not a fully "police" police
[2:41:44] <Asuterisuku> Kim disagrees.
[2:41:45] <%wolfofsound> @Fuji808 but to make you babies happy they don't have to come in to work for a few months but get paid the same
[2:41:46] <Hydrapissed> I am the law
[2:41:48] <%nicversus> but the people HATE the RCM
[2:41:54] <NeekoFM> the people's police

[2:45:41] <aewheros> Or rather the permanent security council members
[2:45:44] <Deasmeister> Germany after WW2 more like
[2:45:44] <%HeroToxiko> They stepped in to Make the state fail
[2:45:45] <lyzejag> 3333
[2:45:46] <+procrastiamus> UN decides the state has failed and then makes sure it fails
[2:45:51] <jorniev> AND THEN DOING LESS than nothing

[2:57:46] <ulcaban> Disco as perpetual hangover
[2:57:53] <kikoeru_san> late 80s and 90s had too much crack to be disco
[2:57:54] <%X2Eliah> Yeah
[2:57:58] <ToxInjection> It's more part of your identity
[2:57:59] <%cobalt_phoenix_> that makes sense
[2:58:01] <%wolfofsound> true
[2:58:05] <%X2Eliah> Ppl who got stuck in 90s had the WORST luck
[2:58:06] <Lelfro> we will be old men in hoodies
[2:58:06] <Klefth> Aka older millenials and the 90s
[2:58:06] <TrueSatanos> It's what you feel comfortable in
[2:58:12] <iacus_> the haircut you keep is the one you get dates with
[2:58:13] <resloxxx> the clothes make the man
[2:58:27] <mr_sups> Flannal
[2:58:28] <linSP> better wear those cyberpunk clothes or be a boomer
[2:58:30] <%KetsuoTaberu> I will be wearing hoodies and jeans for the rest of my life
[2:58:33] <ToxInjection> I do want to wear more smart clothing as I get older though
[2:58:36] <Mr_Zero5232> Some ppl stopped wearing bell bottoms only cause they stopped selling them in 00s
[2:58:36] <%X2Eliah> ppl stuck in this decade will wear hoodies forever
[2:58:49] <Monkeyweed21> decrepit old men wearing Supreme Hoodies
[2:58:54] <+Exicuren> Fanny packs, mullets
[2:58:54] <dukenux> ^
[2:58:55] <kikoeru_san> That shit was probably sexier way back when too
[2:58:57] <Lelfro> Hoodies forever
[2:59:01] <andre11dr> Nah fuck that, I want to wear the stupid bullshit future clothes when I'm going to be 70
[2:59:02] <+Jeshk0> just like Weezer was cool alt-rcok, but now it's lame dadrock
[2:59:04] <derap41> Stuck in Disco
[2:59:08] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @X2Eliah why you gotta call me out like that LUL
[2:59:09] <iacus_> @andre11dr same

[2:59:18] <%KetsuoTaberu> god I hope not
[2:59:19] <lambishly> His face is mom jeans
[2:59:19] <+Urgotfantasy> HOODIES NEVER DIE
[2:59:22] <derap41> jeans has been worn for over 200 years
[2:59:24] <DSD24> Jeans and Hoodies are too comfy to die
[2:59:26] <yomamma133713> hoodies are immortal
[2:59:26] <%HeroToxiko> Jeans and hoodies have been a thing for a long long time
[2:59:30] <dbag202> Lmao grandpa DRIP
[2:59:34] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[2:59:35] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> jeans are pretty immortal
[2:59:35] <Monkeyweed21> Grandpa whats Supreme?
[2:59:35] <+justianxix> New age jeans, the neo jeans
[2:59:36] <DSD24> Plus Hoodies are nice
[2:59:36] <Indigo_Automaton> Hoodies are an archetype, not a fad
[2:59:37] <Inqy833> And then eventually things come back around because what was old becomes what's novel. All my friends are naming their children like, Albert and Ethel. Really grandparents names.
[2:59:39] <+lemon_lore> armour
[2:59:40] <Lelfro> Light Suit + Hoodie tho
[2:59:40] <Indigo_Automaton> So are tshirts

[2:59:46] <derap41> tech wear when?
[2:59:46] <ToxInjection> Hoodies wll die off at SOME point. Decades from now, but they will. I'll still use my collection though
[2:59:50] <+Exicuren> Jeans and hoodies will be seen more like practical clothing than a fashion, I want to think
[2:59:50] <+Prevot> grandpa and his anime shirts, listening to his game soundtrack vinyls
[2:59:54] <+babyacid> im in my 40s and all my peers and myself are still doing hoodies and jeans
[2:59:59] <%cobalt_phoenix_> WE'RE ALL GONNA BE STEVE BUSCEMI IN THAT 30 ROCK BIT HELL YEA
[3:00:02] <%SirGO0SE> grandpa please take off the hawaiin goku shirt
[3:00:04] <Mr_Zero5232> Occasionally there will be an insufferable dick bitching no one is wearing suits in 80 degree weather like no one they grew up with
[3:00:06] <DSD24> Finger Guns!
[3:00:08] <%ChoculaUltra> just as long as people stop wearing hoodies under suit jackets I'll be fine.
[3:00:09] <spaceitaly> "I used to be with it, but then they changed what IT was, now what I'm with isn't it, and what's it seems weird and scary to me"

[3:43:28] <+yusefHD> @yusefHD I'm scared to do this tbh. Meme run first.
[3:43:29] <flamegawdferny> Remember the NBA and Blizzardsaid BLM but didn't give a fuck about Hong Kong
[3:43:30] <QuicksilverMachine> Or what they think the path of least resistance is
[3:43:31] <%wolfofsound> corporations are shape shifters
[3:43:37] <%krispen_wa> Corporation is capital, and capital is heartless
[3:43:39] <derap41> people forget
[3:43:44] <jorniev> governments are like that too
[3:43:45] <lonosis47> So why does woolie shill for corporations for 15+ minutes every CSB podcast? LOL THE IRONY.

[3:44:38] <aewheros> You can't please everyone. Stand by your own convictions.
[3:44:39] <LlewynMarie> the one corp that goes against this is P&G but only barely
[3:44:40] <%wolfofsound> @yusefHD true
[3:44:44] <andre11dr> Brands don't have believes, they just have ends and means
[3:44:46] <linSP> SILENCE BRAND
[3:44:51] <%Irridium> "Get Detention on GoG!" *5 minutes later* "Due to Concerned Gamers we are removing Detention from our store"
[3:44:55] <derap41> FAKE NEWS

[3:45:17] <%wolfofsound> still they made fanta
[3:45:20] <+ATentacleMonster> have a great day y'all LuvSign
[3:45:23] <%cobalt_phoenix_> they still made fanta to be able to sell in germany tho
[3:45:28] <%Irridium> snopes has gone to shit lately
[3:45:29] <Asuterisuku> Not a real ad - but wouldn't be surprising if it WERE.
[3:45:33] <+yusefHD> Is this the real life, is this just fantasea
[3:45:33] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:45:42] <+Prevot> don't worry the fanta thing is still true
[3:45:43] <flamegawdferny> Don't you wanna wanna Fanta?
[3:45:44] <derap41> @Asuterisuku That's dangerous talk
[3:46:00] <QuicksilverMachine> @Irridium One of the owners left, it got worse then
[3:46:02] <+Jeshk0> !MOTIVATED
[3:46:02] <@Moobot> 2213 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[3:46:02] <+Bitscreed> The Fanta thing is actually quite fascinating.
[3:46:02] <bobdoletrasher> i like fanta
[3:46:13] <%krispen_wa> @lonosis47 no, I'm saying you sound like the people who think they're smart for  saying that people cant criticize facets of capitalism and society while living in it.
[3:46:51] <%cobalt_phoenix_> the fanta part is real tho
[3:46:54] <%nicversus> The TL;DR is that fanta was developed by coca cola in order to keep doing business in nazi germany during WWII without having the coca cola brand, which was associated with American values
[3:46:56] <iacus_> put that as an annotation in the youtube
[3:46:57] <flamegawdferny> TBH most don't people don't realize/care about the companies they get their products from
[3:47:05] <%BisoromiBear> thank god I can drink my flavored corn syrup with a clean conscience
[3:47:23] <%krispen_wa> Fanta is Nazi juice
[3:47:26] <+OblivionSword1> yeah the fanta one was real
[3:47:32] <DatAsuna> Fanta was basically left over ingredients repurposed yeah
[3:47:44] <Robot_Nixon_> I hate all products :)
[3:47:44] <yomamma133713> fanta yes

[3:48:06] <+yusefHD> Anyone else have immigrant parents who call all flavoured soda fanta tho? LUL
[3:48:12] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Tuna_Can_0 take me with you
[3:48:26] <pi_in_the_sci> Fanta exists because Coke bottling plants in Germany could get the right ingredients because of blockades
[3:48:32] <%Javaa01> Yeah I don't know what was up with that stroke
[3:48:34] <andre11dr> Well,i don't know how to tell you ,but most research in medicine dose come from the files they took from the experiments the Nazi did
[3:48:34] <%KetsuoTaberu> ? LUL
[3:48:39] <flamegawdferny> I'm curious, do Neo-Nazi's use Fanta like Fago with Juggalos?
[3:48:40] <+yusefHD> LOL
[3:48:42] <%Javaa01> I saw it roll by in chat and I got nothin
