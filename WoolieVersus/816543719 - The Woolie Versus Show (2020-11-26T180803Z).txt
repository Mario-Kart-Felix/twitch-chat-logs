[0:02:45] <%cobalt_phoenix_> MrDestructoid MrDestructoid MrDestructoid
[0:02:53] <%ion900> do you think it could be worth letting Woolie know about a translation error in this game?
[0:03:35] <+Amaideus> Has he already seen it?
[0:03:40] <%Th3SmartAlec> @ion900 Th nonbinary thing?
[0:03:44] <%cobalt_phoenix_> depends
[0:03:49] <%ion900> I can't remember, it's in Ryoko's route
[0:03:56] <%ion900> no not the nonbinary thing I don't care about that
[0:03:58] <+Amaideus> Then don't say anything imo
[0:04:01] <%ion900> this was a typo of two years
[0:04:10] <%ion900> *two time periods mixed up
[0:04:13] <%cobalt_phoenix_> probably best to leave it be
[0:04:19] <GoogleyGareth> SourPls
[0:04:30] <+Amaideus> Just sit on it until he notices it and gets confused by it
[0:04:46] <%ion900> I'll go back through the video and check if he saw it
[0:05:11] <Iniudan> Hi all
[0:05:58] <CaptainBright> I need to savour Woolie dunking on Gundam Seed some more; IT FUELS ME
[0:06:26] <+JacknZack27> Oh yeah. I saw someone mention that translation error on the 13 sentinels sub reddit earlier
[0:06:33] <%FuqBoiSlim> More 30 Centennial Aging Rice baby!!
[0:06:33] <%ion900> twas I
[0:06:47] <%ion900> he missed it, but I think he could trigger it again in her route at a later time
[0:06:49] <+MetroidPrimeRib> my yakisoba pan
[0:07:06] <YakumoYomi> Happy Thanksgiving, nerds. I won't be sticking around (to avoid spoilers), but I sincerely hope ya'll are taking it easy today.
[0:07:07] <+drakthebest> Man, Woolie always has great music for these sections
[0:07:30] <+JacknZack27> Well unless he notices and gets confused its probably best to just leave it
[0:07:56] <%ion900> you're right. it's bugging me to an irrational level
[0:08:06] <%ion900> but no harm, no foul
[0:08:37] <+inkthepeasant> SourPls
[0:09:30] <X2Eliah> This is some *weird* anime music, tell ya what.

[0:14:09] <+BlueJoneleth> Welcome to tonight's episode of Woolie will figure it out... maybe
[0:14:22] <%wardogleader15> Congrats on the play button!
[0:14:23] <%MyNameIsRasus> one step forward two steps back
[0:14:24] <%Th3SmartAlec> One step closer to flushing out the Empty Lot
[0:14:30] <%MyNameIsRasus> do it do it DO IT
[0:14:37] <atravelbee> Yakuza!!!!!!!!!!!
[0:14:41] <atravelbee> YEEEESSSSSSS
[0:14:44] <%Irridium> speaking of Yakuza Like a Dragon is fuckin' sick
[0:14:44] <%bread_assassin> Yooooo
[0:14:49] <+MetroidPrimeRib> continuing adventures of a single scene recontextualizing the entire game again
[0:14:53] <X2Eliah> Super hyped for Yakuza tbh.
[0:14:54] <+BlueJoneleth> baka mitai
[0:15:01] <atravelbee> @Irridium I hope it wins game of the year, like a dragon was soooooo good
[0:15:09] <%MyNameIsRasus> Dame dame moments incoming
[0:15:15] <socratetris> amae na
[0:15:20] <%bread_assassin> So is Yakuza gonna be with Little V and not Reggie?
[0:15:22] <OfficerMods> u ain't ready
[0:15:23] <%gatorafan> Reggie Souls tho
[0:15:33] <%MyNameIsRasus> dudebros gonna be dudebros
[0:15:38] <CappuccinoGuil> @gatorafan he doesn't have a PS5 tho LUL
[0:15:41] <socratetris> Yakuza V and Reggie Souls sounds good
[0:15:41] <%wibbwobbler> bad cod, good sci fi
[0:15:44] <%MyNameIsRasus> reggie souls is gonna be so good
[0:15:56] <+MetroidPrimeRib> the mp was also terrible
[0:16:00] <X2Eliah> @WoolieVersus Hey Woolie so what happened with your PS5, did it get bricked or what?
[0:16:06] <+MetroidPrimeRib> that's a big part
[0:16:09] <%Irridium> @atravelbee honestly for me 13 Sentinels is my GOTY but Yakuza is easily #2
[0:16:10] <%Th3SmartAlec> It would have been better received if it wasn't called "Call of Duty"
[0:16:12] <%FuqBoiSlim> The multiplayer was ass tho wasn't it?
[0:16:16] <%Wool> gobble gobble
[0:16:18] <CaptainBright> With 13 Sentinels and Yakuza 7 racing to be GOTY candidates, Matt's tweet is rapidly aging very, very poorly
[0:16:19] <socratetris> @x2eliah he didnt get one yet
[0:16:23] <OfficerMods> cod wants boomtown current year edition
[0:16:26] <+BigBruthaThunda> cod fans want GREY
[0:16:28] <+BigCoffee> people come to call of duty to eat the same peperoni pizza every year, constantly, forever, with no creativity
[0:16:31] <X2Eliah> From his twitter I thought he got one
[0:16:32] <+BigCoffee> except for modern warfare
[0:16:34] <CappuccinoGuil> @CaptainBright what was the tweet?
[0:16:35] <+BigCoffee> infinite*
[0:16:35] <%FuqBoiSlim> Like people buy cod for the mp and if thats ass then its useless to them
[0:16:41] <OfficerMods> boom town is great so who can blame them
[0:16:42] <socratetris> I didnt see that update then XD
[0:16:46] <pixel_river> Id still be really interesting if woolie ever tried cod4, probably not happening though
[0:16:52] <%Razputin217> Not enough brown and gray, 3/10
[0:16:59] <+Amaideus> I refuse to buy CoD or any annualized franchise specifically because it feels like there's a hard time limit on how much fun I can enjoy with it before it dies
[0:16:59] <%MyNameIsRasus> end of the shooter arc
[0:17:37] <%gatorafan> We enter the crime arc (we never left)
[0:17:37] <OfficerMods> @amaideus yakuzi doe
[0:17:37] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts

[0:18:21] <+Amaideus> I appreciate Yakuza from a distance
[0:18:28] <OfficerMods> also it has the tie defender
[0:18:30] <jorniev> i miss old battlefront 2
[0:18:32] <+Amaideus> Not for any reason, I just haven't ever bought one or wanted to
[0:19:14] <jorniev> BALCK OPS 3 aparently was terrible and i didnt even know 4 existed
[0:19:23] <%wibbwobbler> tru
[0:19:23] <X2Eliah> Myeeeeah, Call of Duty audience does not care for sci-fi.
[0:19:31] <%Irridium> 4 was the Multiplayer Only one. lol.
[0:19:37] <jorniev> really
[0:19:53] <socratetris> No new thing, only new old thing, but dont be new or old
[0:20:00] <+FunStuffAvenue> i like the weird sci fi direction cod took for a second, if only for being widly different

[0:27:22] <X2Eliah> is there any warranty?
[0:27:22] <%Deft_Thought> Deft_Thought subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months, currently on a 7 month streak! Hey Woolie and Reggie. Still recovering from the mental damage of "Jim Crow Terms of Service" from the podcast this week. Quality.
[0:27:25] <%MyNameIsRasus> I'm glad I don't depend on it for a job so I can wait a couple months to get one
[0:27:32] <%BallerSwagBro9k> My PS1 still works perfect and I've had it since launch
[0:27:32] <+McSoliace> oh god are you even able to yell at Sony for that
[0:27:37] <%gatorafan> Woolie kinda has to, because work, but yeah. People should wait
[0:27:37] <+MetroidPrimeRib> do NOT use rest mode
[0:27:38] <+Knight_Anastasia> I just bought a PlayStation 5 lastnight on Walmart. They finally fixed the scaper issues.
