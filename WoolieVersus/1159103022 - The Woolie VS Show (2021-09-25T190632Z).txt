[0:17:16] <yukichocomilk> i'm so hype for melty
[0:17:17] <@Menitta> melty looks cool. might pick that up later. plate is too full
[0:17:20] <DianaTheAscian> Melty blood looks good
[0:17:25] <vicious_rage> woot melty is awesome
[0:17:29] <mortificent> oh yeah, they showed a bit of Live Action Bebop, looks pretty fine
[0:17:33] <andre11dr> I wish is was hype for Melty but the caracters are so..
[0:17:41] <%holydeviant1> Melty is the first fightan I tried to really get into, and might try again
[0:17:42] <$ggbhtg> Rollback is coming for Dreamcast games, betas are already quite solid
[0:17:47] <%SirGO0SE> @andre11dr samie? yeah i feel that
[0:17:50] <OkamiDude15> melty lookin like melty which is fine by me
[0:17:51] <%krispen_wa> the artstyle is limited by sameface takeuchi
[0:17:59] <%WeepyDevil> woolie uh
[0:18:09] <%WeepyDevil> yeah lol
[0:18:09] <%holydeviant1> oh man you shoulda seen how it started, shit was rough
[0:18:21] <@Solidus_113> Saberface forever
[0:18:27] <%WeepyDevil> there is a lot of wilder designs if you go into stuff outside of tsukihime and FSN
[0:18:36] <%holydeviant1> Nasu and his art buddy workin out of their basement
[0:18:37] <andre11dr> Let's put it this way, if Melty caracters where naked ,you couldn't tell who they are
[0:18:39] <%krispen_wa> and thats why Kishima Kouma is the coolest character on the roster
[0:18:43] <+eanscrale> Takeuchi kinda plateaued after og melty blood ended, and that was like a decade ago/
[0:18:45] <%WeepyDevil> im not into fgo at all, but there's some cool designs
[0:18:53] <%livlinn> Too many Altoria faces NotLikeThis
[0:18:53] <%SirGO0SE> is it racist to put on nasu face
[0:19:02] <%holydeviant1> @WeepyDevil FGO has a /lot/ of guest artists, mind
[0:19:03] <@Menitta> Guilty Gear Strive visuals and shading and model quality does not complement the generic designs of Melty
[0:19:12] <Deko_> i mean designs can be cool but they can still be kinda samey
[0:19:12] <%WeepyDevil> the new fire/ice dead apostle (vampire dude) is cool
[0:19:18] <@Menitta> so yeah that's the ceiling
[0:19:19] <@Solidus_113> does melty have the drip though
[0:19:25] <OkamiDude15> fgo is fine since they get a shit ton of guest artists in for the servants they add
[0:19:29] <leith_aziz> I'm having a hard time deciding on it. The game looks beautifull for what it goes for. Aside from Volv(?), I'm not really feeling a main. This is also REALLY subjective, but I feel like I wanna give the game an fair approach, so I should find out about the lore like I did with GG (to be fair, I did get hard into GG lore)
[0:19:30] <%WeepyDevil> metly has some drip
[0:19:31] <+eanscrale> Where's Sion???
[0:19:36] <%krispen_wa> It doesnt have Aoko's shirt and jeans, so no it does not have the drip yet
[0:19:38] <andre11dr> Melty is low on drip
[0:19:38] <Deko_> get into THE LORE
[0:19:46] <%WeepyDevil> play tsukihime lol
[0:19:53] <%MajorCrasher> LUL
[0:19:54] <leith_aziz> Melty Blood is based of a series called "fate"
[0:19:55] <%holydeviant1> @leith_aziz Thankfully there's just one VN
[0:19:57] <@Menitta> no please....
[0:19:59] <%livlinn> Oh no
[0:20:00] <Futurecity10> There's a lot of rape in Tsukihime
[0:20:05] <%WeepyDevil> @leith_aziz ...no it isn't
[0:20:07] <Shad0wTag> its a crossover
[0:20:09] <+SilverDevilfish> Mollusk
[0:20:14] <+kewlmyc> @leith_aziz Goddamn you
[0:20:16] <%krispen_wa> HE WATCHED IT?!
[0:20:17] <BAM4LFE> as someone who did a very long power point on the franchise, just dont
[0:20:24] <%buff_shiba> Woolie sensed the Fate fans from the Melty story. Clean avoid Woolie
[0:20:27] <%asakura_ayase> ‚ÄúIs it good?‚Äù
[0:20:27] <%livlinn> Reggie into the Nasu rabbit hole
[0:20:28] <OkamiDude15> how can woolie watch something that doesnt exist
[0:20:29] <+eanscrale> It was rough but impressive for something two dnd nerds cooked up in their basement at the begining of the 2000s
[0:20:30] <%Eaglestrike117> What Tsukihime anime? There isnt one?
[0:20:31] <$ggbhtg> @leith_aziz and Persona starts at 3
[0:20:37] <%holydeviant1> The anime is rough, but not a bad *intro*
[0:20:38] <Shad0wTag> between tsukihime, knk and I forgot the last thing
[0:20:44] <vicious_rage> just watch the first anime's reveal trailer. that was the best thing i saw in hours of anime/VN.
[0:20:49] <$ggbhtg> more like saying SMT starts at Persona
[0:20:51] <@Menitta> Fighting game cool
[0:20:57] <$ggbhtg> Fight on
[0:21:00] <+kewlmyc> Chaos being gone is going to suck
[0:21:02] <%WeepyDevil> woolie getting into tsukihime via the anime is uh
[0:21:03] <OkamiDude15> persona starts at trinity soul
[0:21:03] <%krispen_wa> They ruined Roa's hair
[0:21:04] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Granted you don't need to be a lorefiend on everything
[0:21:05] <%livlinn> Tsukihime reboot with ufotable is happening right?
[0:21:06] <%krispen_wa> I hate it

[0:21:44] <+CAPSLOCKlive> fear the Schwing
[0:21:58] <+eanscrale> like the GRD
[0:22:02] <leith_aziz> memes aside, I am a Persona fan, so we know about P2 and its sequel and the SMT games nicobShrug
[0:22:03] <TigerClaws12> and a pause button

[0:36:11] <OkamiDude15> voiced by keifer sutherland
[0:36:12] <leith_aziz> @andre11dr I just remember not knowing what im suppoused to do at one point
[0:36:14] <%kyh9> This is probably alt-dimension with the Cereza from Bayo 1 sent back in time
[0:36:15] <+Dumple_Roe> or an alt. bayo

[0:36:25] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @generalve

[0:36:46] <%cobalt_phoenix_> at long last, there was news
[0:36:47] <+Kiyosuki> between bayo being split in 2 in the original trailer, to the new logo being split into multiple moons think it'll definitely be something related to alternate universes

[0:38:23] <+Kiyosuki> All the fanart of Luigi as Charlie from Its always Sunny has been almost worth it though.
[0:38:23] <%livlinn> LUL woolieKICKDAD LUL
[0:38:24] <+LeaIsChill> it's gonna be the Grinch remake, just alright
[0:38:27] <+Parrish_broadnax> No I legit think this will be great
[0:38:30] <leith_aziz> That movie was decent to be fair
[0:38:32] <+Parrish_broadnax> the cast seems so fun
[0:38:34] <+Kiyosuki> Literal Green Man. LUL
[0:38:38] <%bahookery> maybe Ryan Reynolds as Pikachu was the testing waters
[0:38:38] <MayorRev> @Solidus_113 MAY-RYO. is there a May-Ryo in class today?
[0:38:48] <JdotSweapA> chris pratt iuno
[0:38:57] <+aBoner89> vineMayro vineMayro

[0:39:04] <+kewlmyc> Little green ghouls, buddy
[0:39:06] <%kyh9> I DO HAVE THE IMAGINATION
[0:39:07] <%WeepyDevil> everyone except chriss pratt seems like a great casting
[0:39:08] <%Prevot> oh yeah remember fucking ryan reynolds pikachu
[0:39:08] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[0:39:12] <+Parrish_broadnax> no this is the BEST WAY
[0:39:13] <@Menitta> there is SO MUCH ALWAYS SUNNY FOOTAGE
[0:39:13] <%kyh9> NO
[0:39:15] <leith_aziz> nicobDesire
[0:39:16] <%kyh9> THIS IS THE BEST
[0:39:18] <%Artoo__The_Me> There‚Äôs so many good memes from this
[0:39:18] <tabletopsandpowerbottoms> I want Chris Pratt and Charlie Day talking about Luigi's terminal 7 brain
[0:39:19] <+Parrish_broadnax> I need Jack Black as Bowsette
[0:39:20] <+Tetherline> Chris Pratt is so Cool though
[0:39:23] <DianaTheAscian> Charles Martinet was robbed
[0:39:25] <+Kiyosuki> Ehhh I think Miyamoto's a great game maker but...
[0:39:26] <Dova573> Ryan Reynolds Pikachu worked
[0:39:27] <%kyh9> THEYRE LETTING IT GET MEMED
[0:39:30] <linSP> mario is 25 btw
[0:39:32] <+Kiyosuki> We'll see though.
[0:39:33] <coreybom> It‚Äôs illumation. They make the most basic of basic animated films, and those make money. They‚Äôre Dreamworks without the interesting stuff underneath the snark.
[0:39:33] <Saltmeisterr> SO LONG GAY BOWSER (Derogatory)
[0:39:34] <+Walopoh> Let's give it TIME for each one to simmer
[0:39:34] <leith_aziz> But what about THE MEMES. THE DNA OF THE SOUL
[0:39:35] <ExpressNode> I guess they chose him because he will be riding Yoshi, a dinosaur like a raptor
[0:39:36] <fuji_n2> I can see Jack Black as bowser
[0:39:38] <DetroitSentai> Pratt is the only one i think is bad, like charlie day luigi is genius
[0:39:45] <%WeepyDevil> wtf do you mean "can't possibly imagine them fullfuling these roles" woolie
[0:39:47] <%kyh9> @Dova573 I remember I was yelling in happiness when it turns out Ryan Reynolds was just the dad
[0:39:51] <darkodargon> OH shoot did i miss the steam
[0:39:54] <@Menitta> I can see this being sub youtube fan animation
[0:39:59] <JdotSweapA> chris pratt can only act as chris pratt
[0:40:01] <%kyh9> 2040: Smash Bros the Movie comes out
[0:40:02] <%WeepyDevil> charlie day, jack black, these are great
[0:40:03] <tabletopsandpowerbottoms> Can't wait to see Donkey Kong and his Donkey Bong
[0:40:04] <OkamiDude15> @darkodargon prestream talk
[0:40:05] <guiltyboya> MAMA Luigi
[0:40:05] <%Prevot> jack black bowser is pretty much the same as jim carrey eggman
[0:40:07] <+Kiyosuki> Also Ryan Reynolds was cast as essentially a more or less new character so its a bit different
[0:40:11] <+PMAvers> Or Wario rolls through
[0:40:11] <+Dumple_Roe> or wario
[0:40:13] <%kyh9> IM CAPTAIN LOU ALBANO
[0:40:13] <darkodargon> thank you @OkamiDude15
[0:40:14] <+Parrish_broadnax> Jack Black is going to it as Bowser
[0:40:15] <fuji_n2> it's annoying that he ain't Mario
[0:40:16] <+Walopoh> Pratt and Jack Black have both led and voice-acted in acclaimed animated movies
[0:40:16] <%SanguineQuest> Post-Mario stinger, Sam Jackson comes out and is like "I'd like to talk to you about the Smash Bros. Initiative"
[0:40:18] <DetroitSentai> He's gonna be the voice of god
[0:40:21] <+SilverDevilfish> Mario Mario, Luigi Mario, Cranky Mario
[0:40:22] <%KetsuoTaberu> succeeding the title of Mario
[0:40:23] <@Solidus_113> I want Danny Devito Wario
[0:40:26] <%Prevot> I
[0:40:28] <@Menitta> Danny Devito Wario and Steve Buscemi Waluigi obviously
[0:40:32] <MayorRev> I want luigi to rave about Pepe Silvia
[0:40:33] <%Prevot> I'll bet martinet is voicing wario
[0:40:36] <%patriotrenegade> It‚Äôs gonna be some sort of isekai
[0:40:36] <tabletopsandpowerbottoms> Considering DK, Cranky, and Foreman Spike have been cast, I think the movie is going to be like 'the whole life of Mario' so we're gonna see Mario's dad, Martinet
[0:40:39] <fuji_n2> wait wasnt cranky dead?
[0:40:44] <+Parrish_broadnax> I need Seth in a Donkey Kong Suit
[0:40:44] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[0:40:46] <%Necnill> LUL
[0:40:46] <JdotSweapA> H-H-Here we go!
[0:40:47] <MayorRev> DK is gonna talk about WEED
[0:40:49] <%Artoo__The_Me> I‚Äôm still tryin to figure out where all the Chris Pratt distain came from. Was it the JW movies or am I missing something?
[0:40:50] <yash_lawman> real Dunkey?
[0:40:50] <+redthebaron> if there is no wario on this i will go insane
[0:40:51] <+FutaSnek> DONKEY BONG
[0:40:52] <$razielhex> Donkey Kong is DOnkey Kong the Third; Cranky is original Donkey Kong.  Donkey Kong Jr. is nowhere to be seen.
[0:40:53] <%kyh9> SAMUEL L JACKSON IS LINK

[0:40:58] <@Solidus_113> DONKEY BONG LUL
[0:41:02] <leith_aziz> I don't remember if I've ever watched anything with Seth Rogan, but he seems like he could be very annoying (not stating it as fact)

[0:41:16] <%kyh9> Starsky And Hutch did the same thing
[0:41:23] <+redthebaron> @KeiganOfAstora mario movie
[0:41:25] <fuji_n2> ZELDA WILLIAMS AS ZELDA WHEN
[0:41:26] <%Prevot> wasn't it like 3 generations of Shaft
[0:41:28] <+Everstine> Bongkey Kong
[0:41:31] <KeiganOfAstora> yes but like wtf lol
[0:41:33] <Th3rd3> Bananas and Weed for everyone
[0:41:34] <guiltyboya> @Artoo__The_Me it's probably just the fact that he's cast in pretty much any movie that needs some traction nowadays
[0:41:38] <DianaTheAscian> I'm sick of VAs getting robbed
[0:41:48] <$razielhex> Wario
[0:41:54] <andre11dr> Wait there was an old Shaft?
[0:41:58] <fuji_n2> he got robbed tho
[0:42:05] <+JaseAdrift> I thought they were talking about newer shaft
[0:42:05] <%Artoo__The_Me> @guiltyboya Ohhh, over saturation then. Yeah I can see that
[0:42:06] <$ggbhtg> Chris Rock continues to get to be right about voice acting being "easy" @DianaTheAscian
[0:42:07] <leith_aziz> @Artoo__The_Me I dont think people hate Chris Pratt, but he seems like such a polar pick, or just picked because he's a celebrity
[0:42:07] <+eanscrale> will they still be Mario Mario and Luigi Mario though?
[0:42:08] <%Prevot> Mario: Mama mia! Never in a million years!
[0:42:09] <$razielhex> @andre11dr Richard Roundtree; Samuel L. Jackson was his son
[0:42:14] <$razielhex> Shaft Jr.
[0:42:16] <$razielhex> Son of Shaft
[0:42:23] <+ghostfaceninja_> I believe there's 2 Shaft movies plus the original show
[0:42:25] <+JaseAdrift> like another shaft movie came out after the second shaft
[0:42:27] <OkamiDude15> @Artoo__The_Me something about the church he goes to that supports something bad. i forget what it was
[0:42:30] <tabletopsandpowerbottoms> Jack Black Bowser is gonna have a long angry speech about how he's mad about losing and then Luigi is gonna just go "Ooooookay.... anyway..."
[0:42:30] <@Menitta> problem is it's the Minions studio so it might not EVEN BE THAT
[0:42:33] <boatzndhoez> Son of the wolves shaft
[0:42:35] <+redthebaron> space jam is looming above us all
[0:42:36] <KaseKaizer> stripSuffer
[0:42:38] <+Kiyosuki> It has to do with Pratt's um, spiritual views but I really, really don't want to go into it in a twitch chat
[0:42:45] <+Parrish_broadnax> Dwayne the rock Johnsone as : The Thowmp
[0:42:50] <+Kiyosuki> I'd just look it up if you're really curious
[0:42:59] <%CaptainPileDriver> yeah but wreck it ralph 2 then came out
[0:43:03] <leith_aziz> Ready Player One is weird. I thought it was "ok" when it first came out when I checked the media. Now it seems like that movie was bad
[0:43:03] <guiltyboya> @Artoo__The_Me Pretty much. Other than that, he's not a bad actor at all. He clearly has his type of characters though, and I wonder how he will pull of an italian magic plumber
[0:43:04] <andre11dr> But if it flopped it would be really funny
[0:43:07] <linSP> nintendo does some embarassing things tho

[0:43:38] <$razielhex> @linSP the original Mario Bros. movie, that in reaction to this cast list people are retroactively thinking it was better than it was?
[0:43:40] <@Menitta> Chris Pratt as Mario is not Idris Elba as Knuckles
[0:43:44] <+sonofthedeepsouth> FENCE SITTING WOOLIE
[0:43:46] <waterstealer> milquetoast takes

[0:44:08] <@Menitta> ARROWS ON THUMBNAILS
[0:44:09] <+Kiyosuki> Ironically, they wanted Chris Pratt to play the role that human character that travelled around with Sonic in the movie originally but it was turned down or something. LUL
[0:44:12] <+Walopoh> People forget Lego Movie and Kung Fu Panda were voice-acted by the same guys

[1:19:44] <+TopTieramisu> i'm not saying it's bad, it's just weird af
[1:19:50] <%teslaclesdeviant_> you know what this game needs, short hops

[1:19:59] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Please so that
[1:20:02] <%RealThiele> i mean i doubt the devs expected to get such a windfall of going viral 2 years after release

[1:21:36] <veldepotato> get into sussy games
[1:21:49] <OldManDeckardCain> the fact that this game has rollback and a lot of other more expensive games don't, is pretty sus tbh
[1:22:09] <+TopTieramisu> it's because most fighting game devs are japanese
[1:22:15] <Louie_Salmon> "You playin' them Sussy games again, Darlington?"

[1:23:06] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Can you do a fucking infinite?
[1:23:09] <Pt_Kamen> how many hits did max got in a string? 13 or 17?
[1:23:21] <%RealThiele> i dont think you can infinite but the combo action is real

[1:24:32] <@Solidus_113> green got no name, it's the boss character
[1:24:41] <%teslaclesdeviant_> i mean 5 knife is already so fast you can mix with 5[k] for armor???
[1:24:53] <Louie_Salmon> I was gonna say, the grounded knife moves seemed weak. That's something
[1:25:22] <Oak_bogle> I think it‚Äôs also an overhead to crouch blocking? Isn‚Äôt it?
[1:25:27] <%teslaclesdeviant_> they deserve GUNISHMENT
[1:25:28] <Pt_Kamen> nerf green
[1:25:32] <Asuterisuku> There's a limit to wall and ground bounces in a combo
[1:25:34] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Thisbis going places
[1:25:36] <leith_aziz> @OldManDeckardCain I gotta ask, aside from Namco, I'm pretty sure most devs are set to use Rollback for their future games, and Arcsys games are already guaranteed on that. So i'm not sure why you're still worried. Genuine question nicobFive2
[1:25:41] <+sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[1:25:53] <+TopTieramisu> namco better get on the rollback train
[1:25:53] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:25:55] <Pt_Kamen> cyan is carried
[1:26:16] <OldManDeckardCain> capcom confirmed they will do rollbak?

[1:26:26] <leith_aziz> @OldManDeckardCain Remember MvCI?
[1:26:30] <OldManDeckardCain> eh
[1:26:30] <%teslaclesdeviant_> i mean sfv is rollback it's just bad
[1:26:40] <Asuterisuku> Capcom has done rollback for three games now.
[1:26:45] <MayorRev> see you guys at evo
[1:26:46] <Dova573> This music is too mellow for this
[1:26:48] <OldManDeckardCain> and it was kinda shiet
[1:26:51] <+Yamchadassist> i cant stand braindead green mains just pressing gun all day
[1:26:53] <fuji_n2> so... we all agree amogus bean is the last slot in smash right?
[1:26:55] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah apparently they did do good netcode with Infinite, so it just needs some work in their next game.
[1:27:00] <andre11dr> @leith_aziz SEGA also seems to be anti rollback, with that hole VF5 debacle
[1:27:00] <Pt_Kamen> Capcom has rollback, it's badly implemented, a fan patch fixed it, but Capcom got mad with it
[1:27:02] <+sonofthedeepsouth> G U N
[1:27:04] <%BisoromiBear> need Viper's vocals over this tracx
[1:27:12] <Dova573> MVci had good netcode
[1:27:13] <Asuterisuku> SfxT and MvCI did netcode good.
[1:27:16] <MayorRev> you'll cowards dont even smoke crack
[1:27:22] <Pt_Kamen> Capcom wants to make their own rollback
[1:27:25] <%teslaclesdeviant_> THE RYU VS KEN
[1:27:25] <leith_aziz> @andre11dr Good to keep in mind nicobThink
[1:27:27] <emeraldskrull> hello darkness my old friend
[1:27:27] <Louie_Salmon> Damnit am I gonna have to load this up
[1:27:29] <Dova573> Sfxt netcode was delay what you talking about
[1:27:33] <emeraldskrull> woolieDATTEBAYO_HF woolieDATTEBAYO_HF woolieDATTEBAYO_HF
[1:27:34] <andre11dr> But then again SEGA doesn't even make fighting games anymore
[1:27:36] <MayorRev> canon battle
[1:27:40] <%RealThiele> rooster teeth matchup
[1:27:41] <+Yamchadassist> sf3 online was good but IG made it
[1:27:51] <+TopTieramisu> god damn
[1:27:52] <Dalonomus> @Pt_Kamen its more likely the fan fix cant run on ps4 so they tried their own version.  Last gen cpu's were under powered after all
[1:27:57] <Asuterisuku> SFxT was rollback, and better than SFVs.
[1:27:57] <leith_aziz> From what I understand, SFxT WAS rollback, but it suffered the same issues as SFV
[1:28:12] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Does red get the DRIP shoes?
[1:28:22] <%teslaclesdeviant_> @andre11dr what are you talking about the just rerelease sonic the fighters woolieSMUG
[1:28:34] <MayorRev> red's tauint is the "shhhhh" screen
[1:28:41] <JdotSweapA> @Asuterisuku thats not saying much tho.. LUL
[1:28:51] <+TopTieramisu> god damn
[1:28:54] <OldManDeckardCain> sega is still serious about esports, just look at the esports club in lost judgment Kappa
[1:28:55] <+Jiggisnipe> Capcom has used rollback for most re-releases since 2008 and has used rollback in "main" games since SFxT. Quality of rollback has been bad tho
[1:28:56] <%Sullee789> limmyLaugh
[1:29:00] <leith_aziz> Also Tekken ever since Tag 2 has hints of rollback when you play online, but for some reason it always feels like delay netcode, hence "Tekken is 3" nicobThink
[1:29:03] <Pt_Kamen> @Dalonomus makes sense, since most of my experience is PC
[1:29:18] <andre11dr> SFxT was fine online, but it definitely wasn't the best
[1:29:32] <mattymcfilth> MIND GAMES
[1:29:32] <+TopTieramisu> knifesies
[1:29:33] <%Prevot> maybe sega will use rollback the next time they put an old fighting game in a RGG game LUL
[1:29:40] <Asuterisuku> The onlot was good the game itself was sus.
[1:29:42] <leith_aziz> There are clips on youtube of character animations rolling back like Rollback does. It's so weird

[1:30:28] <Dalonomus> @Pt_Kamen its a real shame too.  the switch to UE 4 late in development made them cut alot of corners in terms of optimization too.  Which make sf5 more cpu heavy than it needs to be compounding the problem

[1:44:13] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> JAck-o is very fun
[1:44:18] <andre11dr> Im playing her a lot
[1:44:18] <leith_aziz> I've bee holding off for the next month and some new content. Though I had a lot of fun last time I played as usual
[1:44:31] <leith_aziz> She is a very fun character if you know how to play her
[1:44:35] <andre11dr> Definitely different from Xrd but she's still fun
[1:44:49] <OblivionSword1> new hobby even
[1:44:50] <andre11dr> Her normals are still pretty good
[1:44:52] <leith_aziz> Her and Sol are a treat to watch
[1:44:57] <Murdercles> did he finish Raidou?
[1:45:12] <%jepupu> jepupu subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months! 
[1:45:19] <@Menitta> Ah man I need to double dip on Strive
[1:45:32] <andre11dr> Her super is really good, dose a lot of damage
[1:45:35] <@Solidus_113> I haven't even booted Strive since the 10th... damn
[1:45:41] <%jepupu> I got to the celestial challenge for the first time a few days ago
[1:45:41] <+Parrish_broadnax> Jack-o April skin is really cute
[1:45:49] <@Menitta> its been a bit since I booted strive
[1:45:53] <+Demoli_PT> did i miss strive?
[1:45:56] <leith_aziz> I think I might give up on Millia as a pocket main. Sol and Chipp are my mains and I've been playing Nago more
[1:46:02] <Meltgar> So, how was Woolimogus fighting game?, Missed it
[1:46:04] <Th3rd3> Reggie cheating on Millia for Jack-O huh? TPFufun
[1:46:13] <leith_aziz> Her design is cool
[1:46:18] <+Parrish_broadnax> A Jack-o with a plan is scary
[1:46:20] <Gc478xf> <3 <3 <3
[1:46:23] <DianaTheAscian> Ky is a lot better now
[1:46:27] <%SirGO0SE> in 2 months the entire meta will be the Jack-O's who are deep in the lab now
[1:46:36] <Shad0wTag> Jack-O has a nightmarish time against people with good buttons and mix ups
[1:46:44] <leith_aziz> I've actually played a lot of Ky last time I played. He's pretty good when it comes to ¬¥"feeling" him
[1:46:45] <%jepupu> I can't believe they buffed nago despite him already being top tier
[1:46:50] <Th3rd3> TehePelo
[1:46:53] <Shad0wTag> Her issue is without minions she struggles to start her offense

[1:47:43] <andre11dr> They buffet everyone tho
[1:47:52] <andre11dr> They even buffet Sol
[1:47:54] <Pt_Kamen> There's never enough power
[1:47:56] <leith_aziz> The intention with the last patch was to buff "useless" or not used enough moves. not necessarily who's weak
[1:47:58] <%ozzrabbit> Is Kye still running from the reality of him being Sol‚Äôs son-in-law?
[1:48:00] <yukichocomilk> yeah the balance is really good
[1:48:06] <%jepupu> Sol and May are top tier.. but Goldlewis is really good against them.
[1:48:08] <leith_aziz> That's why Wild Throw was buffed, even if Sol is top tier
[1:48:13] <Meltgar> It's like GoldLewis, he might be slow as hell, but if he hits you ONCE with the Behemoth typhoon, it can bring the match back
[1:48:21] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> compressed tiers are good tiers so eyo
[1:48:22] <zenith0111> TRUE
[1:48:26] <SomersaultJustice> buff may Kappa
[1:48:31] <DianaTheAscian> You mean Laust?
[1:48:32] <andre11dr> Anji is pretty good tho
[1:48:47] <leith_aziz> @ozzrabbit Their relationship is not to mention ther family tree so that they can still be rivals. I love these guys nicobAYAYA
[1:48:48] <Shad0wTag> God I hope Pot continues to go unchanged
[1:48:54] <Dova573> Is because Axl gets muled when you get him in the corners
[1:48:57] <Dova573> corner'
[1:48:59] <+Parrish_broadnax> I do be playing Gio
[1:49:00] <iroh20> Goldlewis is only dood on console due to latency
[1:49:06] <+RodrigoCioffi> ino is best gril
[1:49:06] <Ramasama13> the real answer is your main is bottom tier and everyone else is s tier
[1:49:07] <Shad0wTag> my sanity would go if they nerf pot
[1:49:08] <leith_aziz> @Shad0wTag I can see Garuda Impact getting nerfed
[1:49:10] <+Parrish_broadnax> Theres a mod that gives Giovanna Wolf Ears
[1:49:15] <+Parrish_broadnax> It is literally a power boost for me
[1:49:20] <%SirGO0SE> I play Ram, I'm degenerate can confirm
[1:49:22] <Shad0wTag> console latency went down fam
[1:49:24] <leith_aziz> Ram is high mid, but I dont see her being that good
[1:49:24] <andre11dr> Sol is still dirty
[1:49:27] <OneThousandTomatoes> ram is rough
[1:49:30] <DianaTheAscian> Didn't they lower the latency?
[1:49:31] <leith_aziz> and I dont even play Ram
[1:49:48] <%SirGO0SE> there are definitely less Ram players now than there were a few weeks ago
[1:49:53] <%jepupu> Jack-O vs Goldlewis is already like 8-2 if Jack-O concentrates on zoning
[1:49:56] <leith_aziz> Also what? All I see is people meming about Sol. That hasnt changed
[1:50:05] <%RealThiele> never hear much about Ky and Leo
[1:50:09] <Dova573> Axl is the highest Mid tier for sure
[1:50:11] <leith_aziz> Anji got more fun, but he and Faust are exactly in the same place in the meta
[1:50:12] <%jepupu> If Jack-O tries to get in, then it's more like 3-7
[1:50:14] <andre11dr> Sol Wild Throw buffet ,that shit is nuts
[1:50:21] <restingbones> Thats how I feel trying to play Blue against Cyan, its just an unfair matchup
[1:50:21] <OneThousandTomatoes> i hear so much about leo
[1:50:31] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> they say Chip mirrors are 9-1 matchups
[1:50:32] <Shad0wTag> @leith_aziz I would argue now Anji is better than Faust
[1:50:38] <OneThousandTomatoes> and also a lot about ky
[1:50:43] <leith_aziz> @andre11dr It made the move actually be used more, so I say taht's a good change
[1:50:55] <leith_aziz> @Shad0wTag I felt he always was btter than Faust
[1:50:55] <Dova573> forget sol I think the real Thiefs are Chips
[1:51:11] <andre11dr> I used Wild Trow tho  it's good for closing
[1:51:13] <gunstars20> LUL
[1:51:15] <OneThousandTomatoes> totsugeti dot exe
[1:51:17] <leith_aziz> Nago was really good pre-patch. It's just that now people realise he's good
[1:51:21] <DianaTheAscian> Nago will forever remain solid
[1:51:23] <andre11dr> But now it's really good
[1:51:30] <@Menitta> I like how the move is just referred to as "totsugeki"
[1:51:32] <Shad0wTag> @leith_aziz Ah to me it was more equal prior to his buffs
[1:51:50] <%jepupu> Nago's beyblade is probably why people are complaining about him. It's a neutral skip button.
[1:51:53] <Shad0wTag> @menitta does anyone know the real name of the game
[1:51:56] <+Parrish_broadnax> I think he updated the run that back to work with jack-o
[1:52:02] <$ggbhtg> saw a Bayo Millia mod earlier today
[1:52:05] <@Solidus_113> yeah it was updated, just need the new file
[1:52:13] <andre11dr> Honestly i don't understand why people care so much about the tier list in this game
[1:52:28] <Shad0wTag> @andre11dr its just vidya game thing in general
[1:52:29] <leith_aziz> The one problem I have dealing with Jack-O is getting a jump in on her because her lows go REALLY low. I'll get used to it thtough
[1:52:29] <Dova573> Because they wanna justify their loses
[1:52:31] <andre11dr> This game i the most balanced GG has been
[1:52:38] <+Parrish_broadnax> Yeah woolie the latest update to the run that back mod works with jack-o Now
[1:52:38] <Meltgar> Play the characters you LIKE, don't care the tierlist
[1:52:39] <%RealThiele> chip that rust off time
[1:52:47] <OneThousandTomatoes> no theres a program called totsigeki dot exe that mkes connecting with server faster @menitta
[1:52:51] <andre11dr> It's not like Zappa and Testament are in this game

[1:53:06] <OblivionSword1> gotta earn your spot again
[1:53:08] <@Menitta> @OneThousandTomatoes Oooh I see.
[1:53:16] <@Menitta> Still, what IS that move called?
[1:53:19] <leith_aziz> If I want to get to Celestial, I just play with Sol or Chipp. It's worked out so far
[1:53:23] <OneThousandTomatoes> true
[1:53:36] <leith_aziz> If you're talking about Nago, he could legit be. Either him or Sol
[1:53:47] <leith_aziz> Red bar
[1:53:50] <DianaTheAscian> 6p is faster and sss lower's blood faster
[1:53:59] <DianaTheAscian> Thats been a thing
[1:54:02] <leith_aziz> oh, that got changed?
[1:54:03] <%RealThiele> that homerun blood sword
[1:54:12] <leith_aziz> I didnt know!
[1:54:12] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:54:13] <Deko_> Kappa
[1:54:17] <leith_aziz> Yes
[1:54:18] <Th3rd3> yes
[1:54:20] <leith_aziz> Nago WAS one shot
[1:54:22] <stormhawk9891> He was
[1:54:22] <zenith0111> Ram is Shooting
[1:54:25] <andre11dr> "balanced" Kappa
[1:54:30] <OneThousandTomatoes> Hotashi's youtube has a lot of really good breakdowns of nagos gameplay, match-up, and counterplay
[1:54:33] <DianaTheAscian> Nago has always been one shot
[1:54:41] <leith_aziz> Everyone else seems unchanged
[1:54:44] <+Parrish_broadnax> lol
[1:54:49] <leith_aziz> Yes
[1:54:59] <leith_aziz> I kinda prefered that, but this aint bad either
[1:55:08] <%jepupu> "One shot" = Unga and then die?
[1:55:09] <Frogwash> What does gio say?
[1:55:12] <+RodrigoCioffi> man, i cant get enough of gg music, its so good
[1:55:15] <leith_aziz> This is at leats more closer
[1:55:16] <DianaTheAscian> Was Leo always balanced?
[1:55:22] <$razielhex> need some tokugeki in my life
[1:55:22] <leith_aziz> @DianaTheAscian Yes
[1:55:23] <+RodrigoCioffi> @Frogwash rushdown
[1:55:25] <zenith0111> They didnt have Long Range or Unique. just tricky
[1:55:34] <@Menitta> I had a beer called Jack-O recently
[1:55:39] <@Menitta> it was pumpkin
[1:55:41] <Murdercles> Faust was always Unique
[1:55:45] <andre11dr> Pick the purple color for Jack-O tho
[1:55:50] <leith_aziz> Ah, the Woolie skin
[1:55:51] <%jepupu> Jack-O might be pretty good against Nago as long as Jacko just zones.
[1:55:53] <leith_aziz> perfect
[1:55:53] <andre11dr> That's my favorite one
[1:55:54] <Th3rd3> Woolie prep for more lore
[1:56:11] <DianaTheAscian> Axl and Faust I think were both called unique pre patch
[1:56:15] <%RealThiele> shes too cute
[1:56:17] <leith_aziz> nicobVibing nicobVibing nicobVibing nicobVibing nicobVibing
[1:56:28] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> they finally made the older ost-s louder
[1:56:28] <leith_aziz> Ah, GG music. No matter the game, I love most of them
[1:56:48] <+RodrigoCioffi> imo this is the best stage
[1:56:49] <WakeUpThrow> Pretty sure only Faust was "Unique" before. Afaik Axl was always "Long Range"
[1:56:56] <DianaTheAscian> LUL LUL LUL
[1:56:58] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[1:57:17] <+RodrigoCioffi> @leith_aziz only hits, no misses
[1:57:23] <DianaTheAscian> They also did something to that super but idk what
[1:57:34] <leith_aziz> The more I listen to GG music, I realise how GOOD it's at conveying depth if that's understandable. Like it's as meaningfull as the character's "lore"
[1:57:38] <andre11dr> Her design is really cool and i usually hate the waifu type caracters
[1:58:02] <Th3rd3> the flip
[1:58:10] <+RodrigoCioffi> nago with purple hair looks so good
[1:58:10] <leith_aziz> Yeah, I find Jack-O cool, and her relation with Sol is entertaining
[1:58:15] <WakeUpThrow> The flip into 6H is too good Kreygasm
[1:58:32] <OneThousandTomatoes> yeah I really like jack-o place in the story rn
[1:58:49] <leith_aziz> Does anyone know when is TGS?
[1:59:03] <andre11dr> Reggie why you going in like that
[1:59:07] <DianaTheAscian> Yes its better now
[1:59:08] <leith_aziz> His 5SSS buff is really good
[1:59:12] <andre11dr> Throw more homies

[2:00:04] <DianaTheAscian> The speed one is very good
[2:00:16] <andre11dr> Yeah, the self destructive super is pretty good
[2:00:27] <andre11dr> If you learn to set it up
[2:00:35] <leith_aziz> The "use" buff makes the minions insane

[2:00:44] <leith_aziz> because they stay onscreen for many uses
[2:01:02] <OneThousandTomatoes> it helps that the invincible minion super affects minions you throw during it too i think
[2:01:11] <+CoolRanch792> its a frame zero command grab i think
[2:01:29] <@Solidus_113> you can combo into it too

[2:05:02] <+TopTieramisu> woolie is playing woolie
[2:05:27] <%krispen_wa> So where was this Jack-O during the story mode?
[2:05:38] <andre11dr> Reggie what are you doing LUL
[2:06:10] <leith_aziz> @krispen_wa It's pretty clear she was pretty down about being gone, but Sol wouldnt have any of that shit
[2:06:27] <+Parrish_broadnax> GET in
[2:06:54] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> oh the rust is real
[2:07:10] <+Checktrap> GET IN THAT ASS !!!!!

[2:07:28] <+Parrish_broadnax> Da Goons
[2:07:55] <leith_aziz> I love her RC JoJo pose
[2:08:01] <zenith0111> jackos only 1 years old
[2:08:03] <@Solidus_113> 2D really good
[2:08:03] <andre11dr> You have to get more than 1 out for that super to be worth
[2:08:09] <OneThousandTomatoes> nice
[2:08:14] <DianaTheAscian> Her 2D is great
[2:08:14] <+FutaSnek> Sheeeeeesh
[2:08:20] <leith_aziz> Wollie going IN
[2:08:24] <leith_aziz> nicobPog

[2:08:39] <+TopTieramisu> nago's too damn cool
[2:08:46] <+FutaSnek> BE AGRESSIVE B E AGRESSIVE
[2:08:52] <leith_aziz> Nago is awesome nicobEZ
[2:08:59] <Th3rd3> halocopter
[2:09:02] <+Parrish_broadnax> and died outside
[2:09:04] <+Parrish_broadnax> lol
[2:09:14] <%CaptainPileDriver> yo just got back from errands, we on pc right?
[2:09:25] <leith_aziz> I'd hate that move if it werent for the fact that he beyblades
[2:09:25] <+Parrish_broadnax> yep yep
[2:09:29] <%CaptainPileDriver> yosh
[2:09:34] <leith_aziz> It's too good
[2:09:47] <Th3rd3> bite THIS!!
[2:10:10] <%jepupu> Jack-O's j.D works well against nago
[2:10:17] <zenith0111> Shouldve 6p instead of 2h there
[2:10:23] <+Parrish_broadnax> take the mask off Reggie
[2:10:37] <leith_aziz> I remember having the hardest time againt Ky as Nago if he decides to zone
[2:11:04] <OneThousandTomatoes> i think nago had a had time against zoning
[2:11:10] <+TopTieramisu> what a win pose
[2:11:29] <zenith0111> 60% gone in 3 hits
[2:11:51] <OneThousandTomatoes> because as gio my gameplan is always to let nago come to me and waste blood
[2:12:09] <zenith0111> @woolieversus The minions are +15 when attacking
[2:12:21] <leith_aziz> @OneThousandTomatoes Well, Gio has pretty good way to force the opponent to approach with 2D
[2:12:43] <zenith0111> its 4 less frames then a Garuda Imapact from Pot
[2:12:50] <andre11dr> That's what Jack-O should be doing, just chuck the homies, make nago come to you
[2:13:19] <andre11dr> He has to use blood to escape once you get 2 on screen
[2:13:27] <DianaTheAscian> Nice
[2:13:30] <leith_aziz> nicobOkay
[2:13:41] <zenith0111> The key to fighting Jacko is to pay attention to her minion gauge
[2:13:44] <arkv01> oh shidd what happened to amogus?
[2:14:12] <zenith0111> Zato has to attack in tandem with Eddie when Jacko can make her minions solo
[2:14:40] <leith_aziz> @arkv01 They couldnt go online
[2:14:44] <arkv01> ahhh
[2:15:40] <+TopTieramisu> LMAO
[2:15:40] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:15:45] <+Parrish_broadnax> we no longer livin
[2:15:45] <andre11dr> Don't bust Reggie
[2:15:54] <andre11dr> Good
[2:16:11] <+TopTieramisu> he busted
[2:16:28] <zenith0111> @woolieversus When the minions are being thrown you can still hit them. Think of them as volleyballs!
[2:16:32] <OneThousandTomatoes> i heard that matchmaking in that game was rough since the creator wasn't able to pay for good servers
[2:16:40] <andre11dr> Nice punish
[2:16:43] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> man, watching Strive just makes me wanna play it
[2:16:44] <andre11dr> Kappa
[2:17:33] <leith_aziz> It was fun chatting with you guys. Thanks for the stream Woolie. Night nicobWave
[2:17:57] <$LowSkillGod> GOONS
[2:18:02] <zenith0111> Invincible Minion Super is her strongest move
[2:18:12] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[2:18:15] <zenith0111> They only die to supers once she does that
[2:18:18] <DianaTheAscian> Yuo
[2:18:21] <DianaTheAscian> Yup*
[2:19:33] <zenith0111> The kick is - but special cancellable
[2:20:08] <zenith0111> Minion summon hold is + but not normal minion summon from kick
[2:20:21] <zenith0111> its weird
[2:20:43] <zenith0111> Basically all her buttons have some form of RPS
[2:22:09] <+TopTieramisu> her whiff animation LUL
[2:22:23] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> so yeah, Jack-o's very fun even at an intermediate level
[2:22:34] <zenith0111> Her super grab range is very shallow despite the animation making it look like a leap
[2:22:44] <Puhff> Nothing personal, kid
[2:22:44] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:23:04] <%xcompleasedad> xcompleasedad subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months, currently on a 19 month streak! So, how's the rust coming off? No chunks missing?
[2:23:07] <andre11dr> Yeah her super dosen't have that much range
[2:23:28] <andre11dr> Reggie still hasn't combod into it
[2:23:36] <+TopTieramisu> LMAO
[2:23:40] <andre11dr> I wonder if he knows
[2:23:45] <zenith0111> LUL
[2:24:03] <Th3rd3> they should make her Elysion Driver air-ok just like in Xrd TPFufun
[2:24:04] <Murdercles> no punish  lol
[2:24:12] <andre11dr> Bruhhhhhhh
[2:24:20] <%jepupu> Dropping a minion on oki is what I've seen a lot of jack-o's do
[2:24:34] <yukichocomilk> jack-o is rough cause you gotta play her and you gotta play guilty gear at thesame time
[2:25:16] <zenith0111> Jacko 6H is better than Axls 6k
[2:26:28] <zenith0111> So Green Bar means how many minions she can summon. Gray means how many commands she can do
[2:26:30] <andre11dr> Wasn't that supposed to get fixed?
[2:26:34] <tolloponik> wow! that bite dose DAMAGE now
[2:26:41] <andre11dr> The Nago super
[2:27:00] <zenith0111> Nagos grab does waaay more damage the higher the blood meter
[2:28:02] <andre11dr> There we go ,just zone him out
[2:28:05] <zenith0111> 8 seconds in and Reggie lost 80%
[2:28:18] <andre11dr> He has to use blood to escape those situations
[2:28:57] <%MutedMimic> woolieF
[2:29:38] <zenith0111> Jackos zoning is not that reliable because the counter play to it is pretty universal

[2:31:05] <zenith0111> That Woolie chuckle as he kills the minion lmao
[2:31:16] <andre11dr> This is over
[2:31:41] <$LowSkillGod> to be a master of Jack-O you first must win a game of Dokapon
[2:31:43] <%SirGO0SE> we getting some viewer matches in later? im raring to go
[2:31:58] <zenith0111> The minons can block for her while Holding but costs minion meter and only blocks high
[2:32:39] <+Lobster_Lord> i wish the counter hits didn't distort the music
[2:32:57] <andre11dr> Yeah Reggie keeps leaving gaps for him
[2:33:07] <@Menitta> thats some real good pressure with the little minions
[2:33:45] <Electrichobo> i feel like minion shield does well against Nago right?

[2:39:14] <%MutedMimic> woolieOMG
[2:39:18] <Th3rd3> no bite for you TPFufun
[2:39:48] <andre11dr> Why you biting at ,fool
[2:40:36] <andre11dr> This color looks really cool ,it actually makes the yellow lighting work
[2:41:21] <+JaseAdrift> Nice steal
[2:41:23] <zenith0111> Fun fact all yellow effects are the ones that give shock state. They thought itd be too confusing if all attacks were blue
[2:41:42] <zenith0111> In the trailer footage you can see Ky shoot Blue Stun Edges
[2:41:42] <andre11dr> Ahh i see
[2:41:47] <+TopTieramisu> halloween ky has the drip
[2:42:21] <andre11dr> Still should've been blue tho ,i don't think the yellow lighting looks that good
[2:42:50] <ElPlasa> Yeah, I feel like there are basically two matchups: Kys who abuse air fireball and Kys who dont
[2:43:04] <%jepupu> Gorilla spin
[2:43:10] <zenith0111> Lys cant really abuse fireball tho. Kys fireball is literally trash tier
[2:43:22] <zenith0111> Its only good for giving the Shock State
[2:43:55] <Th3rd3> RTL!!!!
[2:43:58] <zenith0111> Octobers update main focus is fireball changes because of this
[2:44:12] <andre11dr> There's two type of Ky players, the patient one that zone and try to keep poking you, and the one that go in AND KEEP GOING IN
[2:44:12] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:44:21] <+complexstupidity> is this pc?

[2:45:48] <OneThousandTomatoes> LUL
[2:46:01] <andre11dr> @th3rd3 That crosses with the never stop going in type
[2:46:38] <+Lobster_Lord> my locals might be opening up soon, so excited
[2:48:21] <ElPlasa> you hate to see that
[2:48:56] <HotSauceFiend> I just popped in. Is reggie playing Ky? I though he played with the... hair weapon woman
[2:49:02] <andre11dr> This matchup is a slugfest huh?
[2:49:40] <+gitgouda> love me some ky gameplay
[2:49:45] <Meltgar> Reggie is more into many characters, which is great cause we can see Reggie tech with all those characters
[2:49:50] <Bonebagmel> THAT WHIFFED?
[2:49:57] <Bonebagmel> did that whiff on hit??
[2:50:07] <@Menitta> I know everyone got buffed but how well did Ky get it
[2:50:24] <andre11dr> Very well
[2:50:30] <andre11dr> Better SD
[2:50:37] <zenith0111> Ky wants his opponent constantly in shock state
[2:50:37] <andre11dr> Better Install
[2:50:58] <Th3rd3> 2nd Ride
[2:50:59] <zenith0111> Minus one billion and no punish
[2:51:09] <yukichocomilk> ky is busted. like the other 16 busted characters
[2:51:11] <andre11dr> Which Reggie still hasn't used yet
[2:52:03] <Meltgar> Prob Pot? Don't know if reggie or woolie had played with GL yet too
[2:52:03] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:52:42] <digi_bye> !lurk
[2:52:49] <andre11dr> No ,I'm saying Reggie isn't using his Install
[2:56:09] <zenith0111> Youre mad plus on Blood Rage btw
[2:56:31] <zenith0111> I wanna say its around +20?
[2:56:34] <%snausages_> i got no idea how to fight nago as i-no
[2:56:58] <%snausages_> feels like RPS where prize for losing is getting hit by a truck D:
[2:57:19] <andre11dr> Nago can 2D I-No dash a lot i imagine
[2:57:49] <zenith0111> This stage lags you should probably change it
[2:57:57] <DianaTheAscian> whats causing the slow downs anyway?
[2:57:57] <+Parrish_broadnax> the slowdown could be the counter mod if you havent updated it
[2:57:57] <andre11dr> Also stroke probably gets beat by the blayblade
[2:58:12] <%snausages_> beyblade beats all aproachs tbh
[2:58:19] <%snausages_> delete this move :(
[2:58:26] <zenith0111> Beyblade can be anti aired
[2:58:35] <andre11dr> Probably use chemical love more
[2:58:38] <zenith0111> its meant to be a low crush
[2:58:49] <DianaTheAscian> A lot can beat Beyblade
[2:58:50] <andre11dr> Try to pressure with note
[2:59:14] <zenith0111> Best stage. I love this Coffe Shop
[2:59:14] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1440823684659245056?s=19
[2:59:31] <zenith0111> Theres a sign on the right for Infinite Hot Chocolate
[2:59:52] <andre11dr> He doesn't have a reliable reversal so if I-No gets him in the corner it can be some nasty mix
[2:59:57] <dustyjordans> Stage may be causing slow down
[3:00:15] <zenith0111> Its definitely the stage
[3:00:52] <zenith0111> That was almost so good

[3:04:05] <+PianoAlone> woah
[3:04:14] <andre11dr> Ok he got it
[3:04:28] <andre11dr> I thought he would miss it again LUL
[3:04:45] <+ghostfaceninja_> how do you get the woolie skin mod?
[3:05:53] <Smitteys867> I wish Nago had a seperate winscreen for when hes in bloodrage
[3:06:31] <andre11dr> Nice burst punish
[3:06:31] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:06:59] <zenith0111> SSS on block gives a fair a good amount of blood back
[3:08:21] <zenith0111> Woolie chose a good character to stick with
[3:08:52] <andre11dr> Did Woolie choose the caracter, or did the caracter choose him
[3:09:16] <DianaTheAscian> Yes
[3:09:19] <zenith0111> DansGame
[3:09:30] <andre11dr> Looking like that ,it's not like Woolie was going to play anyone else
[3:09:50] <@Menitta> WOW
[3:09:54] <%townzzzzz> what a 6P
[3:09:54] <DianaTheAscian> WOW
[3:10:03] <%SirGO0SE> GAMING
[3:10:06] <+Hollow_Mirage> I‚Äôm guessing the skin is a mod for woolie colors considering the hair or was it just a perfect skin?
[3:10:13] <andre11dr> Yo let's go Reggie
[3:10:32] <zenith0111> That move does basically a full bar of blood
[3:10:53] <blackkanye> The Ky special
[3:11:08] <+pupil31> Pretty Anime Boy
[3:11:35] <ElPlasa> Reggie looking almost like Kizzie with those confirms
[3:11:45] <andre11dr> Ky is like 40 but still looks like a pure anime boy
[3:12:01] <+Hollow_Mirage> The benefits of Boning a Gear
[3:12:05] <Smitteys867> Thats cuz of the power of jesus
[3:12:10] <Smitteys867> hes a good christian boy
[3:12:22] <+Hollow_Mirage> We still have confirmation as too why but I will go with ‚ÄúGear Banging‚Äù
[3:12:32] <+Hollow_Mirage> *no confirmation
[3:12:41] <zenith0111> Ky things
[3:13:00] <zenith0111> That positive bonus defense buff saved him
[3:13:18] <Th3rd3> High King command you "Burst or Perish"
[3:13:23] <Blank9> no one expects triple ride the lightning
[3:13:27] <andre11dr> Woolie keeps dying with full burst
[3:13:38] <neroforte177> 3 supers in the span of a minute wild
[3:13:38] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:13:43] <zenith0111> THANK YOU
[3:13:56] <DianaTheAscian> its a shame that thats a issue
[3:13:58] <+Hollow_Mirage> Woolie got those Superfly Callus‚Äô
[3:14:02] <+Grimlockfly> SeemsGood500
[3:14:14] <+Shoosler> what's wrong with this stage?
[3:14:15] <zenith0111> @dianatheascian Its a thing in a lot of fighting games too
[3:14:25] <andre11dr> I wonder if it's just the stage that causes it
[3:14:27] <DianaTheAscian> @zenith0111 sadly
[3:14:28] <zenith0111> @shoosler too much animation and effects
[3:14:42] <Grimlockfly> causing slowdown
[3:14:48] <zenith0111> Amy stage with NPCs is a no go
[3:14:51] <+Shoosler> ohhh dang
[3:14:57] <andre11dr> But it's good to change to stage anyway
[3:15:00] <zenith0111> Or a lot of reflections
[3:15:11] <%mr_sups> mr_sups subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! 
[3:15:17] <andre11dr> We've been looking at this stage for a while
[3:15:31] <zenith0111> Forest and Kys castle each have these fat mirror puddles that slow everything down
[3:15:49] <+pupil31> Game looks laggy right now. Is it just me?
[3:16:05] <andre11dr> Also could use a different song
[3:16:06] <neroforte177> Ky with the drip tho im fucking with the color palate
[3:16:18] <DianaTheAscian> I know they made a list of low lag stages but I forget what they are
[3:16:30] <%Grimlockfly> Grimlockfly subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months, currently on a 3 month streak! Good to see you back, Woolie.
[3:16:41] <zenith0111> Theres a fair amount of good lagless stages
[3:17:16] <andre11dr> The rocket Buddha stage is fine, i think
[3:17:32] <zenith0111> Yeah 7th Heaven District is fine
[3:17:54] <neroforte177> the stage with the big stautes in the bg is pretty good too
[3:18:03] <zenith0111> Its the graveyard stage
[3:18:31] <andre11dr> There was a lot of drama
[3:18:33] <%WeepyDevil> next bit
[3:18:39] <%jinking79> just vshift the drama
[3:18:40] <%mr_sups> Literally Touch Grass

[3:39:21] <DianaTheAscian> oof
[3:39:25] <%SirGO0SE> woolieSPICE LOVE THE SUBHUMAN SELF
[3:39:48] <ct_2> Reggie mains Ky now?
[3:39:50] <%jolene_orenji> I think millia dies the exact same speed as chipp doesn't she
[3:39:58] <Shad0wTag> that's the guts I assume
[3:39:59] <+Parrish_broadnax> hes learnin
[3:40:00] <%mr_sups> Chip has a reversal you have to respcet. Millia does not
[3:40:10] <RealPT1> chipp does have a high guts rating
[3:40:16] <Shad0wTag> A fellow Pot, please do us proud
[3:40:19] <+Demoli_PT> @WoolieVersus even with guts millia still got more health than chipp
[3:40:24] <andre11dr> I gotta be real, every 50th match ,I'll taunt a bitch for no reason
[3:40:33] <+josefd1997> Oo we Ky gaming?
[3:40:36] <andre11dr> Just to make it spi
[3:40:41] <iroh20> 420 life points
[3:40:41] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Afrosamasenpai
[3:40:44] <TigerClaws12> archaic
[3:40:50] <+Demoli_PT> Guts it makes it so early combos do more damage
[3:40:51] <Afrosamasenpai> POT BOIS
[3:40:57] <+Demoli_PT> it incentivizes early bursting
[3:41:00] <+AhegodKira> but the health number is unironically 420 so im cool with it
[3:41:04] <%jolene_orenji> because it sounds COOL and it looks COOL when the lifebars are both towards their end at the end of the match
[3:41:08] <iroh20> chip has 136% percent defense
[3:41:12] <andre11dr> Don't get scooped Reggie
[3:41:13] <Th3rd3> just like Asuka said "We need numbers"
[3:41:21] <iroh20> but hes the only one with 5 guts
[3:42:02] <+Demoli_PT> anji is the only one with 5 guts iirc
[3:42:06] <@Menitta> god Ky's theme is so good

[3:51:37] <+Parrish_broadnax> we no longer livin
[3:51:40] <JakeSG> ggs man
[3:51:42] <Shad0wTag> @andre11dr but don't you run into the MX11 issue where the moves you want are on the wrong variant
[3:51:55] <TigerClaws12> not as much as Churara Keepo
[3:52:07] <+call_me_comic> im a ky genius what you need to know Reggie
[3:52:07] <TigerClaws12> Kizzie doesn't have TK Vapor Thrusts down yet
[3:52:31] <flubdy_> TK?
[3:52:33] <ct_2> Us Anji players have Jiro
[3:52:43] <TigerClaws12> Tiger Knee
[3:52:44] <bazz_tv> a good 'ol trashman Sajam
[3:52:47] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[3:52:55] <JakeSG> tiger knee or also known as instant air
[3:53:09] <ct_2> Anji's buffs are fake
[3:53:10] <TigerClaws12> still Lanji
[3:53:11] <%townzzzzz> he can mix up now
[3:53:15] <neroforte177> no  shenanigans?? must be wacthing the wrong streams
[3:53:17] <Shad0wTag> good lord Anji is a pain now
[3:53:24] <andre11dr> Anji is better
[3:53:31] <ct_2> Anji's frame data is too bad for the buffs to matter
[3:53:33] <andre11dr> But still C LUL
[3:53:44] <Shad0wTag> I feel like Reggie is underselling
[3:53:50] <neroforte177> top of the mid teir
[3:54:03] <Shad0wTag> but we need a big tournie Anji main to show us up
[3:54:07] <%townzzzzz> LUL
[3:54:12] <%kinetikpaws> bruhhhhh
[3:54:15] <Blank9> nah, he looks like he has infinite option selects but most of them you recover before he gets them in action
[3:54:35] <ct_2> If you block fuujin follow up, Anji's turn is over
[3:54:57] <andre11dr> Honestly when I'm playing against Anji 5S just always hits him out of shit and loses like 50%
[3:55:02] <%jinking79> happy that i play Leo then
[3:55:28] <Shad0wTag> The parry is still annoying
[3:55:35] <umm_idunno> the air projectile is plus
[3:56:10] <ct_2> You get some in but if you cancel them, thats a lot of frame that Anji is just vulnerable to anything
[3:56:17] <jorniev> did they play the amogus fight game?
[3:56:23] <@Solidus_113> yes
[3:56:23] <andre11dr> Also bandid bringer is really good against Anji ,gets around the butterfly stuff and Fujin
[3:56:28] <+Parrish_broadnax> She Cookin
[3:57:46] <+complexstupidity> if you been watching lordknight, are you excited for melty blood?
[3:57:46] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1440823684659245056?s=19
[3:58:03] <ct_2> if you have meter and anji throws out butterfly for oki, just reversal super, the recovery on the butterfly is insane
[3:58:15] <ZeeJiggle> GGs!
[3:58:22] <point4effort> Family guy busted up splat
[3:58:59] <%snausages_> pog I-no

[4:05:14] <lbrownthedestroyer> Japanese Freddie Mercury

[4:06:44] <andre11dr> And now that shit gives you a combo
[4:08:10] <pirateofpie> I definitely felt exposed lol
[4:08:13] <%SirGO0SE> i like mirrors cause im still learning and wanna steal your tech :)
[4:08:18] <ct_2> The Anji mirror is such a shitshow
[4:08:20] <pirateofpie> GG though
[4:08:29] <%snausages_> whenever I win an i-no mirror the other i-no never rematches for some reason
[4:08:36] <%mr_sups> Sweeet Memories!
[4:08:38] <Shad0wTag> CARVE YOUR WAY
[4:08:43] <andre11dr> Ive played the Sol mirror so much, i know it more than most matchups LUL

[4:08:51] <OfficerMods> BANZAI
[4:08:54] <%mr_sups> Vanish into DAAAARK!
[4:09:08] <%mr_sups> This song grew hard on me
[4:09:16] <Shad0wTag> Pot mirrors are not my favourite but I can't say I'm a fan
[4:09:26] <%townzzzzz> so fast is slowed down
[4:09:43] <%SirGO0SE> yo that kiryu mod for sol looks tight
[4:10:05] <pmmori> A god of war who forgot how to lose
[4:10:15] <+SodiumPatrol> 6p OP

[4:10:15] <Shad0wTag> knowledge check time

[4:14:38] <@Solidus_113> Leeroy
[4:14:49] <ct_2> I mean, people have gotten pretty far with Goldlewis like Gobou
[4:14:57] <andre11dr> Ask UI Golu
[4:15:06] <@Solidus_113> or GT goku
[4:15:10] <RagingRangaNZ> Anyone saying GLD is bad haven't played against a good one
[4:15:35] <andre11dr> Also Jack-O is pretty solid
[4:15:40] <%snausages_> when you get grabbed in the air like that i think you need fd to drop faster
[4:15:46] <andre11dr> Definitely like B+
[4:15:54] <Shad0wTag> @andre11dr only when she gets started
[4:16:06] <Shad0wTag> She struggles to get people off her
[4:16:15] <andre11dr> It's always been like that tho
[4:16:26] <yukichocomilk> I hate axl
[4:16:36] <%snausages_> axl most honest
[4:16:40] <neroforte177> dudes deadass playing a different game
[4:16:49] <%buff_shiba> I think most people just don't like losing to Axl, but don't want to admit he's a tough character to beat.
[4:16:53] <andre11dr> But different was that in Xrd when Jack-O got started, it was hell for the other person
[4:16:53] <@Solidus_113> you gotta know you can actually hit the chain too
[4:17:02] <@Solidus_113> chain has a hurtbox
[4:17:02] <andre11dr> Here, eh not so much
