[0:12:32] <$mrfreezepunsbestpuns> cheer500 I'm somewhat sad you're being forced to watch HxH 2011 and not the old one, that one is one of my favourites and has such good atmosphere, while 2011 rushes through conversations making them seem unnatural and loses so much of the amazing body language 1999 had. Keep on keeping on.
[0:12:34] <alrobot2014> i put jerk in my eggs

[0:13:17] <randominternetsurfer> @mrfreezepunsbestpuns Woolie despises the OVA.
[0:13:24] <%ECRead> there's something to be said about adding so much spice that it takes away flavor of the meat etc
[0:13:39] <+chiazam> IdespisetheOVA
[0:13:40] <Iwashi94> hath the Gamer Cube arrived yet?
[0:13:40] <+Donkula23> mix that shit up in some liquid salt (soy sauce) and let that shit sit in the fridge covering your steak for a day or two
[0:13:51] <jorniev> NO STOPS IN THE WAY
[0:13:55] <sexdrugsvideogames> or always using the same spices for every dish
[0:13:58] <vulkan_vibes> wear N95 masks for malak impressions
[0:14:07] <%krispen_wa> don't overspice your steaks. a good steak speaks for itself

[0:17:04] <NeakGX> Code Geass is an Action Comedy and I enjoy it as such
[0:17:04] <%bread_assassin> @ThePimpGuin All I remember is the first one they did where Lelouch wins by moving his king to the front lines. And that was nonsense.

[0:20:56] <%FuqBoiSlim> ResidentSleeper
[0:20:58] <%Gruhunchously> Pineapple on pizza if fine guys
[0:20:58] <+Shikari21> its really bad
[0:20:59] <ralphfromdk> GKannel Sounds like a dessert pizza? :P
[0:21:00] <derap41> Soon all people will eat pineapple pizza
[0:21:00] <$SWFanatic> why would you want a clown on a pizza
[0:21:01] <CybertronPrime> They hated Animal Crossing because it told the truth
[0:21:01] <@Menitta> Woolie supports the Mayo Pizza
[0:21:02] <Tucker0603> but what if i actually hate pineapple though?
[0:21:04] <BallerSwagBro9k> AMEN
[0:21:05] <+tearfuldevil> get off your high horse
[0:21:05] <LoneO7> what if i have aphobia of clowns?
[0:21:05] <+wunp_fxs> chicken and pineapple is so good tho...
[0:21:06] <%JustYudha> I...I like plain cheese
[0:21:06] <zecht89> And they don't even realize they're parroting
[0:21:07] <+kapcommunist> where was this convo during the podcast smh
[0:21:07] <GoldeNOVA> Not all Brazilian Pizzas are that gross, most are normal
[0:21:08] <+Donkula23> I did try it, it's trash....
[0:21:08] <indig0bird> Pineapple ham+bacon is great
[0:21:08] <+Shikari21> but thats cause i dont like pineapple
[0:21:08] <+Bluemanzee> Pizza is freedom
[0:21:09] <%Wouldz> dont stop
[0:21:10] <%Lion_kun> Pineapple on pizza is a sin and you need Jesus.
[0:21:13] <WackyModder84> Pineapple on Pizza may be bad (Yes I have tried it before), but you haven't seen nothing until you've tried Pizza on Pineapple. Kappa
[0:21:14] <goldenchaos96> CHEESE DOESNT GO WITH FRUIT
[0:21:16] <vulkan_vibes> complex flavor combinations are anathema to white folks
[0:21:17] <GarbageNirvana> Pineapple's good if it's not dry af like a lotta pizza places do
[0:21:19] <$mrfreezepunsbestpuns> I don't like any pizza
[0:21:20] <sexdrugsvideogames> of course a canadian would say that, they invented the pineapple pizza
[0:21:21] <austinj24> Had it, its gross to me
[0:21:21] <TheVerySeriousLewis> Now if you grill some pineapple, put that on a pizza and I'll love it. Canned pineapple straight onto a pizza is shit.
[0:21:22] <mexicansunglasses> A lot of arrogance and assumption in your own subjective food taste Woolie
[0:21:23] <+tearfuldevil> I HATE PINEAPPLE in any circumstance
[0:21:25] <%doc_ock_rokc> I hate pineapple pizza because the combination doesn't work for me
[0:21:26] <alrobot2014> okay but that shit just ain't true, pinapple makes me gag at the scent and i've vomited after eating it.
[0:21:26] <%Djinnazz> YUK
[0:21:29] <goldenchaos96> ham + pineapple is fine
[0:21:32] <BearSawed> Okay Fuck you woolie I have had pineapple on pizza, and I hated it. Pizza is my favortie food
[0:21:34] <derap41> Woolie all movements have a counter movement
[0:21:35] <@Menitta> You JUST said how brazillian pizza infuriates you
[0:21:36] <+SolidusRex> Pineapple is trash
[0:21:39] <+kapcommunist> says the guy who would eat steak with mashed potatoes!
[0:21:40] <+Qsmash_> salty and sweet makes my stomach hurt
[0:21:41] <%FuqBoiSlim> Woolie stop the capping. pineapple is a sin against fruit. you know this
[0:21:41] <+wicketpelican> Ham + Melon or Bacon + Melon is great!
[0:21:42] <%JustYudha> Hawaiian BBQ Chicken pizza is God Tier and it has pineapples.
[0:21:42] <goldenchaos96> ham + pineapple + chesse is WRONG
[0:21:44] <@akuda_bar> bacon ice cream is strong
[0:21:46] <+Suplexsenpai> You’re trash
[0:21:47] <+wicketpelican> Bacon with Caramel is great too
[0:21:48] <zanzibarian_hamster> You can convice anyone of everything so long as you say "surprisingly" or "actually"
[0:21:51] <GoldeNOVA> Pizza elitism is the most first world shit I've ever seen
[0:21:53] <@Commando_Joe> @Menitta Woolie has admitted he's a massive hypocrite
[0:21:54] <gunsrlove> Nah, you're just gross on this one Woolie
[0:22:01] <derap41> That isn't chocolate though
[0:22:02] <algibraic> the acids in the pineapple also cut through the fats and oils in the meats and cheese
[0:22:03] <%mitchteck> I didn’t like it when I was a kid I need to try it again
[0:22:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> Ugh BBQ on pizza is bad too
[0:22:08] <mexicansunglasses> Pineapple can suck my ballz

[0:22:09] <Maleicus> what the fuck
[0:22:10] <@Menitta> Mhm
[0:22:10] <sexdrugsvideogames> pizzaghetti
[0:22:11] <@akuda_bar> salty caramel is unf
[0:22:13] <TheVerySeriousLewis> Bacon ice cream is nasty. But it's the same deal though. Badly made food will always be bad.
[0:22:14] <%ChoculaUltra> you can say the most bat shit things ever, but if you're super confident about it no one will question it
[0:22:15] <%Th3SmartAlec> Hmmmmm
[0:22:17] <Darth_Mama> Gordon Ramsay deemed pineapple pizza to be a sin.
[0:22:18] <+MidnightBurst12> pineapple adds an extra sour to the flavor that just doesn't work

[0:38:30] <DatAsuna> it's a weird particle effect
[0:38:36] <DatAsuna> RC trandos were beefy
[0:38:38] <jorniev> but that will not happen
[0:38:49] <jorniev> sad
[0:38:53] <%Gruhunchously> @LiquidDinosaur It's hard to forget them. Especially the first one you encounter
[0:38:58] <Maleicus> it'd be nice to influence more party members at once
[0:38:59] <LeeOhX> this is like the 3rd time someones intruded onto your ship
[0:39:05] <%andrei11dr> Wait a minute ,if you have Kreia in the party, then wat happens?
[0:39:07] <DatAsuna> eh, rumours of single player kotor "reimagining" in the works
[0:39:14] <DatAsuna> it won't be kotor 3, but it'll be something
[0:39:20] <vulkan_vibes> trandos are beefy as wookies! rival species
[0:39:21] <DatAsuna> likely a canon reboot if it is
[0:39:37] <TheNamelessGun> Would you trust Disney now?
[0:39:44] <derap41> @andrei11dr the answer is don't think about it
[0:39:44] <%Gruhunchously> @andrei11dr Then you don't see her knocking party members out, the slavers just show up and gas everyone.
[0:39:56] <vulkan_vibes> storing away on that ship easy AF
[0:39:58] <DatAsuna> people scapegoat disney too much
[0:40:01] <%andrei11dr> I see
[0:40:04] <%LiquidDinosaur> What if Atton T3 and Handmaiden admitted to each other that Kreia assaulted them
[0:40:05] <DatAsuna> lucasfilm is responsible for a lot of the bs
[0:40:20] <Visorak6> You make a good point sir I'll be going now
[0:40:28] <DatAsuna> it's like the people who chalk up every bad thing blizzard does to activision
[0:40:36] <DatAsuna> nah, blizzard is rotten too now
[0:41:00] <%Gruhunchously> @andrei11dr If Kreia is in your party, you get an extra scene just before this where she looks around, you ask what the matter is, and she says nothing.
[0:41:02] <alexandrecau> how could you kill jedi though?
[0:41:05] <dorpork> The scene was completely pointless. They were already using poison gas to knock everyone out. Kreia wants to test the exile for what? How he deals with some common thugs? It makes no sense. It was cut for a good reason and should never have been restored.
[0:41:06] <JetpackMcQuack> I imagine idiots with lightsabers don’t last long
[0:41:19] <LeeOhX> Where are the other members on the ship?
[0:41:22] <%LiquidDinosaur> gas them, drug them, throw grenades, attack civilains, kill their padawans
[0:41:35] <DatAsuna> or just order 66 them
[0:41:38] <DatAsuna> i.e. shoot them a lot
[0:41:44] <%LiquidDinosaur> @dorpork lots of what Kreia does makes no sense
[0:41:51] <DatAsuna> turns out non plot armour jedi don't block so good
[0:41:56] <dorpork> Some of the stuff added by the restored content mod is really questionable
[0:41:57] <%LiquidDinosaur> she's a Space Libertarian she doesnt have to be logical
[0:42:00] <NeakGX> didn't the scene also show the 'hey this is my ship, OH NO'
[0:42:17] <alrobot2014> how many goons can one ebon hawk hold
[0:42:43] <+SolidusRex> How many Trandoshans can you fit on a freighter sounds like the beginning of a joke
[0:43:02] <Safarihat> stasis field is just nuts
[0:43:08] <%masterpiecejeremy> how many goons can one KOTOR2 handle without making a mess of itself?
[0:43:08] <%LiquidDinosaur> i like how the Ebon Hawk is designed so the main cargo hold has a tiny door and you'd need to bring cargo through a skinny hallway
[0:43:12] <DatAsuna> ah yes, electric judgment
[0:43:13] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:43:14] <+prime_name> It's Rey Lighting
[0:43:14] <Redblood801> LIGHTning
[0:43:17] <ingman112> Nah v wait
[0:43:23] <ingman112> Wait for that prestige
[0:43:24] <LeeOhX> the lightning is blue so it's good guy
[0:43:26] <alexandrecau> the punchline is " a 100 if you have a pantry and a lightsaber"
[0:43:32] <+chiazam> Man this fight kinda boring ngl
[0:43:40] <ingman112> Don’t burn that level on a standard class
[0:43:41] <ralphfromdk> I mean... Killing the with magic lightning or stabbing them with lightsabers.... they still die no matter what :l
[0:43:59] <%LiquidDinosaur> what if you just use Force Push to push the air molecules back and forth really fast?
[0:44:06] <%LiquidDinosaur> that would make lightning.
[0:44:07] <Klefth> "Clean up". That's nothing if not pure good guy talk.
[0:44:25] <%Gruhunchously> @mankeyfigh When we're as stupidly OP at this level as we are...yeah.
[0:44:26] <+TossuDa> !uptime
[0:44:27] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 56 minutes and 38 seconds
[0:44:30] <ingman112> Dammit no
[0:44:38] <$SWFanatic> i forgot to be more wise
[0:44:41] <indig0bird> aaaand you lost a prestige class level
[0:44:53] <DatAsuna> there's basically just 2 endings
[0:44:55] <%Irridium> but force lighting is reeeeeeeal neat
[0:44:56] <%LiquidDinosaur> @legacy0117 you're not technically a jedi in this game. you got fired. You have no rules.
[0:44:59] <%Gruhunchously> I thought prestige was at level 16
[0:45:00] <DatAsuna> and they're mostly flavours of the same thing
[0:45:13] <%masterpiecejeremy> @LiquidDinosaur only if you only do it on electrons and not full molecules. Making full molecules shake hard enough would cause Force Flames
[0:45:15] <NeakGX> gotta go fast
[0:45:15] <ingman112> Far as I’m aware it’s 15
[0:45:19] <DatAsuna> there was another alternate ending cut and without specfiics I'm glad it was cut
[0:45:29] <%Gruhunchously> Gotta go fast
[0:45:35] <%LiquidDinosaur> @masterpiecejeremy so you're saying that burning people alive is Light but electrocuting them is Dark.
[0:45:42] <%Prevot> you know, you could instantly win every fight with Force CBT
[0:45:48] <gruulmagebeast> master speed gives you 2 attacks
[0:45:52] <gruulmagebeast> ?
[0:46:17] <Redblood801> it adds 2 extra hits
[0:46:18] <$SWFanatic> You're a wizard Fanny
[0:46:35] <%Gruhunchously> Oops
[0:46:39] <%LiquidDinosaur> Did we fuck up?
[0:46:45] <%masterpiecejeremy> @LiquidDinosaur I don't believe the Force has sides. The light and dark sides are just binaries stupid organic brains created to secure themselves in a simplistic sense of morality
[0:46:52] <%LiquidDinosaur> OH GOD IS THIS GOING TO BE THE GLITCH WHERE YOU CANT EVER TALK TO HIM AGAIN
[0:46:54] <%bread_assassin> Shouldn't Woolie have waited like 5 minutes before he leveled up?
[0:47:05] <JetpackMcQuack> What an adventure
[0:47:42] <%BinaryFireball> let me whisper gentle secrets into your ear
[0:47:54] <%LiquidDinosaur> @masterpiecejeremy i can live with the light side and the dark side. But i feel like if you use lightning to kill a bad dude and save people or use Heal to heal someone you're torturing for round two, that should determine if its light or dark.
[0:48:02] <%BinaryFireball> this dude's voice
[0:48:06] <%LiquidDinosaur> or like, your emotions your feeling when you're using the power
[0:48:15] <+therabbles> Bao Dur ASMR
[0:48:51] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[0:48:53] <$SWFanatic> @MrRabbles 100%
[0:48:55] <DatAsuna> he has a nice voice
[0:48:58] <%LiquidDinosaur> Did this ruin Bao Dur?
[0:49:06] <%masterpiecejeremy> that's the thing. The act isn't part of the side. What fuels your influence over the Force does. @LiquidDinosaur
[0:49:09] <%krispen_wa> krispen_wa subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! You can't escape HuntetxHunter, Woolie! It'll chase you to the ends of the eaaaaaarth!
[0:49:14] <Halospaz117> "Sorry general, these still warm body's got me in a conversational mood"
[0:49:15] <%Irridium> I think that's a conversation you can have anywhere
[0:49:25] <Halospaz117> I think you should be fine
[0:49:29] <DatAsuna> new vegas is a lot the same
[0:49:30] <+BlackLightRadia> I joined late? What happened? Is this because you gave the guy "his" ship back?
[0:49:34] <time_axis> I think this is not technically the ship, because the map isn't filled out
[0:49:40] <%Irridium> provided you got the influence, of course. I remember getting that conversation out on planets and things were fine
[0:50:04] <sexdrugsvideogames> can woolie get darth maul devil horns?
[0:50:05] <%optimasmaximas> goth sith Kreygasm
[0:50:12] <%andrei11dr> New Vegas was even more broken at release
[0:50:15] <$SWFanatic> @AverageBlubber The people who owned the landing pad came back and turned out to be trandoshan slavers
[0:50:15] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1242929035937820672?s=20
[0:50:19] <%LiquidDinosaur> @AverageBlubber yes, also Handmaiden noticed that intruders were coming but Kreia punched her out because she felt we need to fight some mooks on our ship to "test" us. This includes getting the entire crew, including herself, knocked out
[0:50:20] <deviljhojho_> back to the best LP on twitch baby
[0:50:22] <%krispen_wa> Big titty goth gf is best waifu
[0:50:29] <+TossuDa> do not mate her!
[0:50:39] <+prime_name> Pff
[0:50:40] <%krispen_wa> I'm gonna mate her!
[0:50:44] <+prime_name> That's some goofy stuff
[0:50:46] <+therabbles> that guy is dying mid conversation
[0:50:53] <DatAsuna> not the captain!
[0:50:57] <%LiquidDinosaur> Realtalk why does Kreia care about who you fuck so much?
[0:50:57] <%krispen_wa> what the fuck is this camera
[0:50:59] <%Pillagius> cohhLUL
[0:51:08] <%masterpiecejeremy> and even then, those aren't light or dark sides of the Force, but of yourself. And only through understanding both your light and dark impulses, can you know yourself wholely and learn to balance them and yourself. Balance requires accepting that which you would rather be rid of. @LiquidDinosaur
[0:51:17] <Redblood801> Now Woolie
[0:51:20] <gruulmagebeast> its funny in the non restored content hes already dead
[0:51:20] <Redblood801> Hear me out

[0:52:35] <gruulmagebeast> hes dead on the floor in te original
[0:52:35] <%Irridium> this is restored content. In the base game he's literally just a corpse LUL
[0:52:37] <Halospaz117> @cinder_chan Yeah I think him surviving is restored content
[0:52:41] <DiabloD_Lunis> Demanding their obedience gets you money
[0:52:48] <%andrei11dr> Wow ,I've never seen this, i always tell him to fuck off LUL
[0:52:49] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> If you choose 1 you could get more dancers
[0:52:50] <%Gruhunchously> Woolie missed the chance for some MORE SLAVERY

[1:01:31] <%LiquidDinosaur> RoBaort OppenheimDur
[1:01:39] <sexdrugsvideogames> @derap41 no
[1:01:45] <KaitlynnHere> It’s like Einstein own personal conflict after he created the atomic bomb
[1:01:48] <DatAsuna> not in this one really garth
[1:01:52] <jorniev> close your heat to it
[1:01:58] <DatAsuna> it's a small star war atm

[1:02:08] <+TossuDa> SourPls
[1:02:09] <DatAsuna> smol even
[1:02:15] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Guilt is such a useless emotion
[1:02:16] <Scrub_Seeker> baodur steps onto malacor and a style meter appears
[1:02:17] <%Th3SmartAlec> He may or may not have pulled a Devil Trigger or two
[1:02:17] <vulkan_vibes> CHANGE THE FUTURE
[1:02:19] <%andrei11dr> It's so hard to take Bao seriously with the robot freaking out in the background LUL
[1:02:30] <+Skittlesoul> what is this music in the background?
[1:02:32] <BallerSwagBro9k> PULL HIS DEVIL TRIGGER

[1:02:42] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Skittlesoul The bot is looping it's noise, a bug
[1:02:47] <DatAsuna> that's more atton's thing
[1:02:55] <sexdrugsvideogames> sounds like mental issues
[1:02:56] <DatAsuna> While your army was in the city
[1:02:56] <indig0bird> But those were nazis and they deserve it tho
[1:02:57] <vulkan_vibes> boop beeped boop

[1:03:11] <%krispen_wa> Fat Boy and Little Man
[1:03:13] <%Gruhunchously> Yeah, war crimes are fine as long as they're against bad people.
[1:03:17] <DatAsuna> lot of pubs and jedi died in the same thing
[1:03:23] <Safarihat> man i want that beat
[1:03:23] <DSD24> Beep badda boop
[1:03:25] <KaitlynnHere> Poor Einstein
[1:03:26] <jorniev> oh god i jsut rememberd what he did
[1:03:28] <dereks0n> Sometimes the Jedi are right about going too far lmao
[1:03:28] <DatAsuna> that's part of why he feels bad
[1:03:34] <Camail> delayed good
[1:03:36] <%krispen_wa> I am become Galactus, Eater of Worlds
[1:03:37] <jorniev> OH GOD
[1:03:37] <derap41> @Gruhunchously No question the Japanese were "bad" guys
[1:03:40] <%GeneralSCPatton> We won the war by doing a thing whose morality will be debated for generations
[1:03:45] <+RowenCleric> delayed good is the best good
[1:03:48] <DatAsuna> also RIP bao dur, he got a major plot line not restored in the mod either
[1:03:48] <+tearfuldevil> "righteous wars"
[1:03:49] <jorniev> HOLY SHIT
[1:03:50] <%LiquidDinosaur> the Mass Shadow Generator is very much a Light Side Later machine
[1:03:57] <DatAsuna> So he'll forever be missing a chunk of his story
[1:03:59] <%Th3SmartAlec> @RowenCleric Light Side Later
[1:04:09] <+captain_history> utilitarianism always gets you in moral quandaries
[1:04:11] <preppyposs> CHANGE DA WORLD
[1:04:12] <YakumoYomi> I like how Dante's Inferno handles the Crusaders
[1:04:14] <jorniev> i rembembered what he did and i need to see woolies reaction
[1:04:15] <%Djinnazz> Tomorrow is in your Hands
[1:04:15] <sexdrugsvideogames> @Gruhunchously well, who is bad? the civilians in the city?
[1:04:16] <DSD24> Change the world my final message
[1:04:17] <+SolidusRex> MY FINAL MESSAGE
[1:04:17] <Scrub_Seeker> change da world
[1:04:19] <DSD24> Goodbye
[1:04:19] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[1:04:20] <joshua_42> What is a righteous war?
[1:04:35] <%Th3SmartAlec> "Wanna learn some magic"
[1:04:35] <+tearfuldevil> like, the nazis were very evil, japan was terrible, USA and britain were pretty terrible as well
[1:04:44] <DatAsuna> Bao dur has more cut content than anyone else
[1:04:47] <Klefth> 14 months
[1:04:52] <%krispen_wa> Bao Dur definitely has the least amount of stuff
[1:04:55] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @vulkan_vibes
[1:04:56] <+BioHunter> hes reeeaaaalllyyy good with tech
[1:05:04] <%GeneralSCPatton> OOPS ALL JEDIS
[1:05:06] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> force sensitive sounds like a social justice issue
[1:05:11] <carlosmiyamoto> He did the last time you talked to him
[1:05:12] <%andrei11dr> Yea, totally
[1:05:15] <%VCRUZZO> he is difficult to do
[1:05:32] <+SolidusRex> He's usually the first I turn into a Jedi
[1:05:34] <LeeOhX> So you can run an entire crew of lightsaber wielders? THATS COOL
[1:05:35] <%andrei11dr> You basically have to take him to the right place immediately
[1:05:37] <+wunp_fxs> it was multiple playthroughs until i got him to be a jedu
[1:05:40] <%Gruhunchously> Dantooine and Onderon have a few
[1:05:45] <%krispen_wa> dantooine gives him a lot
[1:05:50] <dorpork> later planets have plenty of influence points
[1:05:50] <+tearfuldevil> @legacy0117 in kotor 2? cayse, um the exile has a evry set backstory. you can change how its interpreted, but what actually happened was set
[1:05:52] <BallerSwagBro9k> Nar Shadda: Become Jedi
[1:05:57] <DSD24> Man this glitch is so good
[1:05:58] <%VCRUZZO> Dntooine does give him alot
[1:05:58] <+tearfuldevil> cause, not "cayse
[1:06:02] <DSD24> I love this beat
[1:06:04] <DatAsuna> heavy risk
[1:06:07] <DatAsuna> but DA PRIIZE
[1:06:07] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> You can also get 1 in Cezrca base on Telos by helping that guy with that terrible pathing side quest
[1:06:10] <Scrub_Seeker> @LeeOhX you could in the first game too
[1:06:12] <gruulmagebeast> MECHROMANCER
[1:06:20] <LeeOhX> WHAT T
[1:06:21] <%andrei11dr> That's why It's really important to do Narshada first
[1:06:22] <DatAsuna> Shout outs to my boy jacob
[1:06:23] <%Gruhunchously> He becomes a Jedi Guardian, which is weird because he loses most of his skill points
[1:06:23] <DSD24> @gruulmagebeast I like that
[1:06:25] <LeeOhX> I had no idea holy
[1:06:25] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> A ghost in a shell
[1:06:25] <jnaynnay> Beep beep beep biz biz vroooom
[1:06:26] <DatAsuna> bravely cheating on femshep
[1:06:27] <jorniev> you mean like that dude
[1:06:31] <sexdrugsvideogames> why let go of the dark side?
[1:06:37] <Halospaz117> Touch your helmet to mine
[1:06:40] <%BinaryFireball> wow what a horrible idea, give the emotionally damaged guy amazing wizard powers
[1:06:43] <%Gruhunchously> I GET IT, man.
[1:06:47] <jorniev> woolie wants to be like grievous
[1:06:49] <%BinaryFireball> nothing will go wrong
[1:06:56] <%Gruhunchously> I'm not even angry
[1:06:56] <sexdrugsvideogames> that plasma arm is cool
[1:07:13] <%masterpiecejeremy> "Can you teach me to use the force to manage my anger?"
[1:07:25] <%masterpiecejeremy> 'Nah you're too angry"
[1:07:27] <DSD24> Beep Boop Bop
[1:07:29] <xThomasWellertonx> From my perspective the jedi are evil
[1:07:34] <sexdrugsvideogames> force choke your anger
[1:07:35] <vulkan_vibes> DIP skill points.
[1:07:37] <dorpork> those helmets look terrible
[1:07:45] <vulkan_vibes> RIP skill points
[1:07:47] <%GeneralSCPatton> THIS BEAT IS DRILLING INTO MY SKULL
[1:07:57] <%andrei11dr> MrDestructoid SingsNote SingsNote
[1:07:59] <+wunp_fxs> fuck your family
[1:08:02] <Redblood801> Stop having feelings!
[1:08:06] <+tearfuldevil> doo poo ba doo ba doo doo
[1:08:13] <Halospaz117> @wunp_fxs Phrasing
[1:08:15] <%Gruhunchously> Emotions are prohibited
[1:08:15] <Redblood801> Stop being a person!
[1:08:16] <sexdrugsvideogames> boys dont cry
[1:08:17] <DatAsuna> Yoda: Tried not being sad, have you?
[1:08:19] <candidateplays> please finish this conversation so we don't have to hear this
[1:08:22] <+democrazyyy> walls up
[1:08:25] <+tearfuldevil> yoda in ot is w grumpy wise teacher, yoda in prequels is an idiot
[1:08:26] <+StooEsq> Feelings are STUPID.
[1:08:27] <+ALazo> Close your heart to it boi
[1:08:31] <%Gruhunchously> Have you tried...not being sad?
[1:08:36] <Nested_Dreams> Don't let it set in Anakin
[1:08:36] <%krispen_wa> star wars is basically just a story about why havign therapists are nice
[1:08:37] <%Th3SmartAlec> The Jedi teachings is a breeding ground for new Sith
[1:08:37] <KaitlynnHere> Just don’t look at it
[1:08:37] <%LiquidDinosaur> WHEN BAO DUR IS A JEDI CAN HE STILL UPGRADE HIS PUNCH?
[1:08:39] <DSD24> Your emotions are all chemicals
[1:08:46] <MoroseLoki> Yeah Luke love yo sister
[1:08:47] <grandark_z317> Jedi can love people, now watch as I murder my nephew.
[1:08:55] <%LiquidDinosaur> WILL YOU FIGHT, ANAKIN? OR WILL YOU DIE LIKE A WOMP RAT
[1:09:01] <%Gruhunchously> And nobody likes you
[1:09:12] <Redblood801> The Sith are Virgil if Virgil never stopped
[1:09:16] <+spacehouse> will LittleV upload Remote's SICK BEATS?
[1:09:22] <sexdrugsvideogames> but in the original movies the jedi were cool...
[1:09:22] <+Fenrein> The Jedi order needed to go.
[1:09:24] <YakumoYomi> Jedi: raising emotionally stunted people for millennia (that may go crazy when those emotions come up later)
[1:09:39] <DSD24> I would make a Robot that has sick beats all the time
[1:09:39] <%Th3SmartAlec> Dropping a new mix tape shitting on the Jedi, feat. Bao Dur's Driod's sick beats
[1:09:40] <+tearfuldevil> the sith are virgil if virgil didn't get his shit kind of excused away by going on a hell vacation
[1:09:55] <sexdrugsvideogames> but it was close
[1:09:57] <NeakGX> 'Emotions are prohibited' sounds familiar..
[1:10:00] <Algorythm44> luke didn't do anything, R2 saved them
[1:10:01] <%andrei11dr> It sucks that most of the Jedi that arw are just selfish just become Dark Jedi
[1:10:06] <%VCRUZZO> YUP
[1:10:12] <xThomasWellertonx> Föther
[1:10:17] <+ThePimpGuin> I mean its more so Lando saves his friends, if luke didn't show up he'd still have his hand and things would be the same
[1:10:20] <+wunp_fxs> good lesson in those movies....
[1:10:23] <%Gruhunchously> This is why I don't understand why people say that being anti-Jedi means you hate Star Wars
[1:10:28] <+SolidusRex> This is why Luke is best boy
[1:10:29] <%Th3SmartAlec> @NeakGX That case is a character using an excuse to cope emotionally
[1:10:31] <Safarihat> r2-d2 is the real hero
[1:10:32] <GarbageNirvana> What's important to remember is that the Jedi FUCKING LOST
[1:10:33] <Redblood801> @legacy0117 We're trying to become Sith, we need MORE hate.
[1:10:34] <atema128> Luke doesn’t save them - they save him.
[1:10:38] <%krispen_wa> and then proceeds to try to murder his nephew at the slightest hint of dark side
[1:10:42] <DukeBlack_> Why didn't they make his mom a handmaiden?
[1:10:43] <%optimasmaximas> just don't emote 4Head
[1:10:52] <T_Sasquatch> Luke decided not to kill Kylo after thinking about it for a second
[1:10:54] <%Th3SmartAlec> "Puberty, what's that?" - The Jedi Council
[1:10:56] <T_Sasquatch> thats not the point
[1:10:56] <xThomasWellertonx> And then Disney happened
[1:10:58] <dereks0n> Too real
[1:11:00] <Klefth> That hits home hard.... .-.
[1:11:02] <+wunp_fxs> just dont be a emotional human, be more robot like
[1:11:03] <NeakGX> ..that's fair
[1:11:03] <+spacehouse> boop bup Bata bada bop boooooo
[1:11:07] <T_Sasquatch> the point is that luke let his fear get to him
[1:11:08] <Dave_VD> turn it off light a light switch. Its a cool little jedi trick
[1:11:10] <sexdrugsvideogames> original yoda was just worried because luke was a noob
[1:11:11] <+tearfuldevil> @krispen_wa we're in EU world now, never happened BibleThump
[1:11:12] <kenny_biff> what did I miss?
[1:11:13] <T_Sasquatch> for a second
[1:11:20] <available_line> And then he forgets it in Last Jedi until Yoda reminds him.
[1:11:20] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:11:21] <Redblood801> Okay Woolie, but hear me out.
[1:11:24] <+Fenrein> What I'm curious about is who decided Jedi shouldn't have emotions. At some point a Jedi must've made a mistake and decided never again
[1:11:27] <Redblood801> SWTOR Light Side Sith
[1:11:34] <GarbageNirvana> Kreia's got it figured out in that regard at least, both are dumb
[1:11:37] <DatAsuna> From woolie's point of view, the chat is evil
[1:11:40] <Skeletonmanners> both things can suck even if one sucks more
[1:11:46] <Redblood801> The Jedi HATE IT!
[1:11:48] <asurite_warrior> didn't they have this conversation before?
[1:11:49] <%Djinnazz> There are
[1:11:50] <KaiserMario> I blame Woolie's upbringing for hatred towards the Jedi
[1:11:52] <%FallenAngelZelos> someone can make the arguement that Luke distracting Darth Vader saved his friends
[1:11:54] <%krispen_wa> LANA BENIKO IS WAIFU
[1:11:55] <brondeef> Space Catholics
[1:11:56] <indig0bird> They're still pretty psychopathic
[1:11:56] <+wunp_fxs> that was the one interesting point in swtor that i liked
[1:11:56] <Visorak6> Lawful evil
[1:11:58] <DatAsuna> it's in chat all the time
[1:12:01] <Melchior_the_Wise> Well, Sith was a race
[1:12:03] <+tearfuldevil> @asurite_warrior they have this covnersation basically every stream
[1:12:05] <+memequisition> Lana Beniko my lovely wife
[1:12:06] <+kekkerscrew> Lightside Sith is Not being an idiot
[1:12:07] <derap41> Lightside simp
[1:12:07] <astrofalcon1> it is chat
[1:12:09] <xThomasWellertonx> remember how Luke was the bestest boy ever but then Disney was like "imma murder this child"
[1:12:11] <dereks0n> The important distinction to me is that the Jedi are completely right to be cautious, but they overdo their caution
[1:12:13] <%ChoculaUltra> Darth Marr was a real one FeelsBadMan
[1:12:14] <RedSqurrl> Thinking Sith
[1:12:15] <DatAsuna> Inquisitor story handles drk/light better than warrior
[1:12:19] <NaturalGear> honestly I think jedis are more interesting this way, otherwise they'd just be your cookie cutter good guys
[1:12:19] <+Bluemanzee> Like Bane
[1:12:19] <+democrazyyy> light side sith is very pragmatic, outs the empire first
[1:12:24] <Melchior_the_Wise> Was Exar Kunn bad?
[1:12:25] <DatAsuna> Warrior compromises the story to push the variance harder
[1:12:26] <xThomasWellertonx> There are gray jedi
[1:12:26] <Finaldragoon> Sith Sorcerer Light Side is a very interesting story in SWTOR
[1:12:27] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> I love Darth Marr so much
[1:12:31] <%LiquidDinosaur> is SWTOR worth playing for the campaigns?
[1:12:33] <Melchior_the_Wise> he seemed like a decent sith lord
[1:12:33] <DatAsuna> exar kun was bad yes
[1:12:37] <DatAsuna> also yes, liquid
[1:12:41] <Halospaz117> No turn everything into Atton cowards
[1:12:43] <DatAsuna> HMU if you want an EU guild
[1:12:43] <OldManDeckardCain> "WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY" Sith warrior LUL
[1:12:44] <+tearfuldevil> @LiquidDinosaur i tried it, but i hate mmos and got bored
[1:12:44] <Redblood801> "She loves you idiot" Light Side Inquisitor
[1:12:45] <time_axis> @LiquidDinosaur Yeah I'd say so.
[1:12:47] <+democrazyyy> very much so, it's the best stuff in that game
[1:12:48] <xThomasWellertonx> and there is always that capitalist Sith
[1:12:49] <Melchior_the_Wise> well, maybe comparitively to everyone else
[1:12:56] <MillaMoks> Like General Leo in FF6
[1:12:59] <sexdrugsvideogames> star wars is just a hypothetical world with eternal good and evil
[1:13:00] <%andrei11dr> Some of the Sith are more interesting than just baby eaters, we might get to see them going true this game
[1:13:02] <NeakGX> the beep boop gets the brain machine going
[1:13:03] <%LiquidDinosaur> @time_axis like even with its supposed "contempt" for Kotor 2?
[1:13:06] <+spacehouse> boop bup Bata bada bup booooo
[1:13:16] <+jake5713> Gaul, Destiny 2
[1:13:17] <KaiserMario> Kraven
[1:13:19] <sexdrugsvideogames> the pirate code
[1:13:20] <%LiquidDinosaur> Say what you will about the Mandos. they lose gracefully.
[1:13:23] <%Th3SmartAlec> From my
[1:13:25] <BallerSwagBro9k> Lawful Evil
[1:13:25] <+RoByte2> The bad guy who heals you before the big fight, like Rubicante
[1:13:25] <%krispen_wa> @liquiddinosaur ignore anything related to kotor ii and its fine
[1:13:27] <time_axis> @LiquidDinosaur I haven't encountered any of that yet, but there are good stories and good moments to enjoy either way
[1:13:30] <%Gruhunchously> FROM MY
[1:13:32] <%LiquidDinosaur> If you defeat them they become your marks for life
[1:13:32] <DatAsuna> not all mandos tho cassus fett was a bad man
[1:13:36] <+democrazyyy> @liquiddinosaur the 'contempt' is that pretty much nothing from ii shows up, but otherwise it's very good
[1:13:36] <%ozzrabbit> Basically Whamu from Jojo Battle Tendency
[1:13:37] <+Slimshazbot> boo da doop bee dea dada boop dooooooooooop
[1:13:38] <%Gruhunchously> M-m-montage
[1:13:41] <%VCRUZZO> this is
[1:13:42] <GarbageNirvana> Hoes no longer mad
[1:13:43] <+wunp_fxs> omg finally stopped
[1:13:43] <+ALazo> hard cut to training montage
[1:13:44] <Safarihat> noooo the beat ends
[1:13:48] <+ItsRatman> Oh thank goodness the beep boops are gone
[1:13:55] <DatAsuna> Divekick!
[1:14:00] <+therabbles> training montage
[1:14:05] <sexdrugsvideogames> so the mod makes the game shitier?
[1:14:06] <%Th3SmartAlec> GONNA NEED A MONTAGE
[1:14:07] <Redblood801> We're going to need a montage!
[1:14:07] <%VCRUZZO> lol
[1:14:07] <NeakGX> I dunno I feel like we may have had time to waste
[1:14:08] <LeafarOz> montage
[1:14:09] <YakumoYomi> "Mezameta mae! Waga arujitachi yo!"
[1:14:12] <Visorak6> Because he might change his mind
[1:14:13] <GarbageNirvana> It's a loaner
[1:14:13] <+CelebrityGhost> How come bao dur can fightfight in clothes just fine?
[1:14:14] <%Gruhunchously> Montage!
[1:14:14] <gruulmagebeast> YA GONNA NEED A MONTAGE
[1:14:16] <+tearfuldevil> @GarbageNirvana the thing is that in ACTUAL original star wars, the light side wins by like, acceptance and shit.
[1:14:16] <Halospaz117> Training saber?
[1:14:17] <LeeOhX> SHUT UP BUILT ONE
[1:14:34] <%masterpiecejeremy> And a thousand souls across the galaxy cried out....musha kata paka
[1:14:37] <xThomasWellertonx> Atton SUCKS
[1:14:45] <Halospaz117> PUNCH JEDI
[1:14:47] <LeeOhX> ATTON IS COOL
[1:14:48] <xThomasWellertonx> Bao is where it's at
[1:14:49] <%Gruhunchously> Yeah, screw Atton
[1:14:51] <%VCRUZZO> GO
[1:14:55] <Klefth> Kreia is gonna LOVE this
[1:14:57] <Halospaz117> Shut your faces, Atton is the raddest
[1:15:05] <%andrei11dr> The hole point of KOTOR 2 is that mindlessly Dark side/ Light side everything is kinda stupid
[1:15:08] <%optimasmaximas> there's no time!
[1:15:10] <sexdrugsvideogames> it was a loaner
[1:15:14] <BallerSwagBro9k> PUNCH JEDI PogChamp
[1:15:15] <carlosmiyamoto> Give someone a saber ):
[1:15:16] <%Th3SmartAlec> He did the Rise of the Skywalker trick
[1:15:19] <Halospaz117> SourPls
[1:15:20] <gruulmagebeast> stop asking questions
[1:15:23] <+spacehouse> sick beats ARE BACK
[1:15:23] <%Djinnazz> he borrowed one of yours
[1:15:24] <+tearfuldevil> @GarbageNirvana like kreia only works looking at the prequels and kotor 1, cause it kind of falls flat looking at what happens in the OT
[1:15:24] <dayspring815> It's a training lightsaber
[1:15:29] <LeeOhX> Kreia is going to be very happy about this 100% for sure
[1:15:33] <sexdrugsvideogames> don't let us down, V!
[1:15:33] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[1:15:41] <%Gruhunchously> Granny, we gonna have a problem?
[1:15:42] <dorpork> ask her to teach you about the force
[1:15:43] <dereks0n> That beeping is gonna be Kenny Omega's new theme, can't wait
[1:15:46] <%Th3SmartAlec> POWERRRRRR
[1:15:48] <Thunderhog> "TALK" to Kreia
[1:15:51] <DatAsuna> UnLIMITED
[1:15:52] <indig0bird> IT'S PRESTIGE TIME
[1:15:53] <+wunp_fxs> lvl up tiiiiiime
[1:15:53] <%andrei11dr> The troubles you say
[1:16:01] <%Gruhunchously> It's time
[1:16:02] <candidateplays> OH YEAH
[1:16:06] <+CavemanInCave> its so funny that 90% of this game is littlev saying okay we gota go talk to so and so RIGHT. NOW. 5% combat 5% "insert woolie reference"
[1:16:07] <GarbageNirvana> @tearknack Yeah but these came out when the prequels were still hot
[1:16:07] <Camail> the time is coming....the time has come
[1:16:08] <%Th3SmartAlec> Number MUST go up!
[1:16:12] <+tearfuldevil> real dnd 3.5 shit
[1:16:13] <dayspring815> Next to become a jedi: T3
[1:16:14] <Space_Pagan> HERE WE GOOOOO
[1:16:15] <gruulmagebeast> this is still the first planet right!?!
[1:16:18] <%masterpiecejeremy> The idea that something as all encompassing and all enveloping as the force could only have two sides is idiotic. If the force were to have sides, it would have so many it would simply be a sphere
[1:16:18] <%andrei11dr> Increase your dick
[1:16:24] <Dave_VD> damn big sesh. all this and still early
[1:16:25] <+tearfuldevil> @GarbageNirvana yeah it came out like, a year after iirc?
[1:16:28] <DatAsuna> watchmen for me
[1:16:30] <RantingRavager> Exar-Kun AYAYA
[1:16:33] <%krispen_wa> @tearknack but also remember that kreia gains influence whenever you take options that try to redeem her like luke did to vader. it very much reinforces the luke style OT Jedi
[1:16:35] <GarbageNirvana> @tearknack I mean she's still a space boomer, ain't nothing gonna change that
[1:16:35] <DatAsuna> but you do you
[1:16:35] <indig0bird> Weaponmasters areso cool
[1:16:36] <LeafarOz> exar kun
[1:16:37] <%Th3SmartAlec> Who watches the Jedi Watchmen?
[1:16:41] <+SolidusRex> Who watches the Jedi Watchman?
[1:16:48] <%Th3SmartAlec> @SolidusRex HA
[1:16:50] <%Gruhunchously> Watchmen has Sneak Attack
[1:16:52] <candidateplays> I mean, she WAS a Jedi master
[1:16:58] <+chiazam> huh? what is this?
[1:17:06] <%krispen_wa> SNEAK ATTACK BOIS
[1:17:09] <+SolidusRex> Beat me to it @Th3SmartAlec
[1:17:09] <TDAWS_MP132> STASIS
[1:17:10] <+prime_name> So Fighter, Rouge, and Wizard?
[1:17:18] <+tearfuldevil> yep
[1:17:20] <%VCRUZZO> yup
[1:17:26] <%krispen_wa> jedi master sucks tho
[1:17:26] <Visorak6> Master fann
[1:17:30] <+tearfuldevil> same as guardian/sentinal/consular
[1:17:30] <DatAsuna> there's also a bunch of presige class mods too
[1:17:37] <DatAsuna> those get fun and silly
[1:17:50] <%Gruhunchously> The Sith Version gets a rage mode
[1:17:57] <+therabbles> new tier
[1:18:07] <%VCRUZZO> its pretty wild
[1:18:12] <sexdrugsvideogames> dual wielding!
[1:18:15] <gruulmagebeast> do dark side characters get different prestige classes?
[1:18:17] <%andrei11dr> I personally recommend weapon master
[1:18:34] <TDAWS_MP132> Watchman is sick
[1:18:35] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:18:40] <%Irridium> @gruulmagebeast they're named differently but do the same things I believe
[1:18:40] <%VCRUZZO> well it gives you different stances
[1:18:48] <DatAsuna> force neogaf
[1:18:55] <%Gruhunchously> A whole bunch
[1:19:02] <DatAsuna> 7 main ones, plus some extras
[1:19:05] <gruulmagebeast> this is the stance _/ _/
[1:19:10] <%optimasmaximas> gun jedi PogChamp
[1:19:11] <%Gruhunchously> Watchman is best for gun Jedi
[1:19:13] <DatAsuna> there's weird cases where 2 names share the same number
[1:19:14] <jorniev> NOT NEOGAF
[1:19:15] <%Pillagius> Jedi Master probably the most fun )
[1:19:30] <carlosmiyamoto> 7 lightsaber forms. 4 force forms.
[1:19:31] <gruulmagebeast> thats od
[1:19:32] <%krispen_wa> A SITH LAWD?
[1:19:34] <sexdrugsvideogames> yeah
[1:19:35] <astrofalcon1> name of the ga,e
[1:19:36] <grandark_z317> A SITH Lord!?
[1:19:37] <indig0bird> 7 Lightsaber Forms, only 6 available for each. 4 Force Forms
[1:19:37] <astrofalcon1> game*
[1:19:40] <sexdrugsvideogames> oh lawd
[1:19:44] <+SolidusRex> A Shit Lord
[1:19:44] <alrobot2014> man i loved being Sith Lord
[1:19:46] <%andrei11dr> Oh lwad
[1:19:47] <Halospaz117> We were the Knights of The Old Republic 2 The Sith Lords
[1:19:49] <%Gruhunchously> Fun fact, if you become a Sith Lord, at the end of the game you appear in the Title Screen.
[1:20:04] <%Gruhunchously> In place of the other Sith Lords
[1:20:05] <sexdrugsvideogames> @Gruhunchously nice
[1:20:06] <%LiquidDinosaur> I like how Sith Marauder gets "Ignore Pain" but Jedi Weapon Master gets "Inner Strength", they're both just damage mitigation but its about "where its coming from" mentally
[1:20:12] <AntifaCatboy> Isn't that for any dark side character?
[1:20:19] <alrobot2014> @Gruhunchously oh so its not just any version of the protag
[1:20:20] <sexdrugsvideogames> M A S T E R
[1:20:20] <DSD24> @gruhunchously That’s awesome!
[1:20:34] <gruulmagebeast> so what level exactly lets you prestige
[1:20:46] <astrofalcon1> oh god
[1:20:47] <Iwashi94> holy shit LUL
[1:20:48] <%Chatterbox1991> OH
[1:20:51] <DatAsuna> thanks aspyr
[1:20:52] <%Chatterbox1991> IT WAS
[1:20:52] <dorpork> ask her to teach you about the Force
[1:20:54] <+CavemanInCave> mind blower right der
[1:20:55] <+Slimshazbot> I missed it, what was it?
[1:20:56] <%optimasmaximas> PogChamp
[1:21:00] <astrofalcon1> such a good pull
[1:21:01] <+spacehouse> where's the dreams that I've been after MASTER
[1:21:01] <KaiserMario> With the exception of something like Dragons Dogma, I find magic in games tend to be very underwhelming...
[1:21:03] <%Gruhunchously> @alrobot2014 You have to be dark side.
[1:21:06] <BallerSwagBro9k> Master Bait
[1:21:07] <%LiquidDinosaur> "I WANTED TO KILL A BLACK BASTARD"—Qui Gon Jinn"
[1:21:09] <Iwashi94> @Slimshazbot "A certain set of skills"
[1:21:15] <DatAsuna> remember when qui gon killed himself with radiation so obi-wan could ctivate the GECK?
[1:21:17] <+Slimshazbot> @Iwashi94 oh lol
[1:21:25] <BallerSwagBro9k> @liquiddinosaur Oh god LUL
[1:21:27] <dorpork> ask Handmaiden to teach you battle precognition
[1:21:32] <+democrazyyy> dude something about the Jedi master and sith Lord classes were just too awesome to have on the character screen, I always picked them
[1:21:33] <T_Sasquatch> im glad corona didnt kill this lp
[1:21:37] <%Gruhunchously> @LiquidDinosaur oof
[1:21:43] <gruulmagebeast> i can sense the prestige nearby
[1:21:56] <%LiquidDinosaur> oh god times like this i wish Woolie had a voice bot i'd happily drop $5 to make a robot lady say that right now
[1:21:56] <%andrei11dr> I do hope they'll just go watch the Sith ending after he finishes, because it's pretty metal
[1:21:58] <%optimasmaximas> grand wizard monkaS
[1:22:10] <xThomasWellertonx> WiMonk yeah
[1:22:11] <%VCRUZZO> we get to power points now right?
[1:22:17] <gruulmagebeast> grand wizard woolie
[1:22:19] <carlosmiyamoto> Dueling!!!
[1:22:19] <xThomasWellertonx> PUNCH WIZARD
[1:22:31] <xThomasWellertonx> I cast FIST
[1:22:39] <DSD24> What spell you cast?
[1:23:03] <%LiquidDinosaur> Little V should enter a console command or something to give woolie Force Crush
[1:23:07] <%Gruhunchously> Basically, both your positive and negative influence effects are greater
[1:23:46] <+CavemanInCave> pretty far from finished woolz xD
[1:24:16] <%krispen_wa> "why are you doing anything" - kreia
[1:24:22] <%Gruhunchously> In the light side playthrouhg, she nags you. In a Dark Side playthrough, she eviscerates you.
[1:24:23] <%joe_bagadou_nautz> Why are you being a space murder hobo?
[1:24:28] <NaturalGear> Kreia's philosophy: just ignore everyone
[1:24:30] <+Llewelln> does he have Restored Content mod?
[1:24:31] <DatAsuna> you will never be good enough for grandma
[1:24:36] <DatAsuna> @Llewelln yes
[1:24:40] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Gruhunchously I feel like she "wants" you to be Light Side.
[1:24:47] <Daskolin> TSUN TSUN KREYA
[1:24:51] <DSD24> Get swole Woolie
[1:25:01] <+therabbles> at the same time being Kreia's favorite grandchild and least favorite grandchild
[1:25:14] <+ItsRatman> Why are you breathing? Haven't you learned to control the force to do the breathing for you? Goodness, you still have mcuh to learn - Kreia
[1:25:14] <%LiquidDinosaur> Like she doesnt approve of the light side but Light Side is the path she actually wants you to take. or more accurately, Fann Y'Pakk is actually closer to her ideal than the game accounts for.
[1:25:16] <+kekkerscrew> look at that Fart sniffer
[1:25:27] <%LiquidDinosaur> healing the galaxy but also looking out for #1
[1:25:44] <indig0bird> Force Storm is lvl 18
[1:25:45] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1242929035937820672?s=20
[1:25:54] <%krispen_wa> 2 more levels until fanny breaks the game
[1:26:12] <%Gruhunchously> It's a good ability.
[1:26:17] <+Llewelln> You are having milk with your cereal? The Arrogance!
[1:26:19] <%LiquidDinosaur> What is it uisng Battle Meditation to affect the Khoonda battle?
[1:26:23] <wahilliham> he didnt take lightning
[1:26:28] <gruulmagebeast> time to fight fuck
[1:26:29] <DSD24> Yo Azula what's up girl?
[1:26:31] <wahilliham> he still has shock
[1:26:32] <%Gruhunchously> But what would poor Bastila think if she realized that everyone now has access to her one special power?
[1:26:33] <indig0bird> And the battle of Isis
[1:26:37] <+kekkerscrew> Did he talk to the Miraluka yet?
[1:26:38] <+Llewelln> ATL: always take lightning
[1:26:40] <dorpork> ask handmaiden to teach you battle precognition
[1:26:41] <indig0bird> Or was it Izis?
[1:26:52] <BallerSwagBro9k> YEYEYEYEYEYE
[1:26:54] <%Gruhunchously> You can tell her to put some clothes on
[1:26:55] <%krispen_wa> bastila has bigger AoE Battle Meditation
[1:26:56] <%optimasmaximas> Kreygasm
[1:26:56] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Gruhunchously i always rationalized it that hers is better. And like, yours even at rank 3 cant just turn the tide of a giant fleet battle
[1:27:00] <derap41> Squidward nose
[1:27:01] <BallerSwagBro9k> Body Kreygasm
[1:27:03] <DSD24> Hot girls always wear chokers
[1:27:06] <+chiazam> That mask is horrendous
[1:27:07] <%Gruhunchously> Ture
[1:27:07] <AntifaCatboy> Did Atris give her that underwear?
[1:27:09] <+TruSanKyuu> Kreygasm
[1:27:13] <OldManDeckardCain> idk her body looks ready already LUL
[1:27:17] <dorpork> ask Handmaiden to teach you battle precognition
[1:27:18] <Redblood801> 1 more
[1:27:18] <indig0bird> She has an actual name
[1:27:22] <wahilliham> ask her about her mom
[1:27:23] <%krispen_wa> that fucking mask
[1:27:24] <%optimasmaximas> teach me senpai Kreygasm
[1:27:27] <Space_Pagan> Denied!
[1:27:30] <dorpork> ask her
[1:27:32] <derap41> Its not just me seeing a Squidward nose right?
[1:27:33] <+wunp_fxs> planet restriction i thought.....
[1:27:34] <TDAWS_MP132> 2!
[1:27:37] <%Gruhunchously> You can talk to the Miraluka now, it's safe.
[1:27:37] <%LiquidDinosaur> it is UNFORGIVABLE that in both Kotor 1 and Kotor 2 there is no point where Bastila/someone with Battle Meditation can use it to rig a sports game
[1:27:42] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @dorpork
[1:27:46] <TDAWS_MP132> you missed it just then
[1:27:49] <%Madbearv> anticipating your attacks

[1:27:52] <DSD24> Its a ugly mask
[1:27:53] <%Madbearv> that's a trigger
[1:27:54] <+CavemanInCave> for a second i thought you meant your mask
[1:27:54] <Safarihat> anticipating attacks
[1:28:00] <Safarihat> you missed it
[1:28:03] <derap41> Cyberpunk girl
[1:28:08] <gruulmagebeast> i like fighting with you with the mask off Kreygasm
[1:28:08] <%Gruhunchously> Ask her about Atris?

[1:30:18] <%LiquidDinosaur> MINDFUCK: Echani is just mechanic without M and C

[1:30:33] <DSD24> @Sol_Install That's how she trains
[1:30:39] <Sol_Install> Got yea
[1:30:39] <+therabbles> the bikini is to assert dominance
[1:30:42] <+Deano8817> hm
[1:30:43] <DatAsuna> echani are rarely used modern
[1:30:43] <+tearfuldevil> not really
[1:30:48] <DatAsuna> and not in canon period
[1:30:49] <sexdrugsvideogames> she breathes thru her skin
[1:30:53] <Redblood801> Quote Little V on this
[1:30:55] <indig0bird> Old Republic stuff, new canon proably doesn't want it
[1:30:56] <jorniev> like spanish swordmen or bruce lee
[1:31:05] <%LiquidDinosaur> Mandos are STR, Echani are DEX
[1:31:21] <%Gruhunchously> Echani are the ballet dancers to the Mandalorians football players
[1:31:23] <+tearfuldevil> kotor race, show up int the kotor spinnoff comics, dont think they're even modern canon
[1:31:36] <dorpork> 99.99% of Echani lore comes from this game
[1:31:43] <+tearfuldevil> wrong
[1:31:49] <%LiquidDinosaur> and in ONE GUY in Kotor 1 there's "iridorians" who are like mandos but worse and Canderous says even mandos are afraid of them

[1:33:50] <Dave_VD> GOD DAMN i missed so much shit when I played this
[1:33:53] <xThomasWellertonx> Epitaph unlocked
[1:33:58] <%GeneralSCPatton> Building to apply new bonuses from stats is the best part of 3.5 and Pathfinder
[1:34:00] <+tearfuldevil> @ralphfromdk there's none, he's just lame
[1:34:06] <DSD24> I love her robes
[1:34:08] <+Llewelln> @ralphfromdk none, the male companion most find annoying
[1:34:10] <%mitchteck> I finished the game and little v is so right deciple is so lame
[1:34:16] <%krispen_wa> @ralphfromdk you get a free nap from listening to disciple bore you
[1:34:18] <dorpork> he has a British accent?
[1:34:21] <+ItsRatman> I thought for sure this would be a fourth wall break and explain why there;s turn based combat
[1:34:23] <%Gruhunchously> As the master teaches the apprentice, the apprentice teaches the master
[1:34:24] <+Llewelln> although I like him somewhat myself
[1:34:33] <+tearfuldevil> thankfully there's been mods to get her as a female PC since like, 2009
[1:34:39] <%Gruhunchously> Yes you can
[1:34:40] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> I think Kriea has something else now
[1:34:41] <%GeneralSCPatton> I had a character with 43 Int and built to apply Int bonus to so many things.
[1:34:42] <%krispen_wa> TALK TO HER
[1:34:43] <+kekkerscrew> RAAAGE
[1:34:43] <%Gruhunchously> But whatever
[1:34:45] <ralphfromdk> Welp, now i'm glad I never played the female route, sounds like a waste of time :o
[1:34:48] <+wunp_fxs> boooo
[1:34:51] <+Llewelln> play as Bastila, or Handmaiden

[1:35:06] <jnaynnay> Did you talk to kreia yet
[1:35:06] <Safarihat> talk to kreia!!
[1:35:07] <DSD24> Yes
[1:35:10] <+kekkerscrew> I don't remember these rules when I played
[1:35:16] <AntifaCatboy> Why can't they talk to her?
[1:35:16] <Retinolgaming> Build a wall around her
[1:35:26] <Sol_Install> MASH
[1:35:27] <+Bluemanzee> To be fair you're barely into the meat of Nar Shadaa
[1:35:31] <%andrei11dr> Just fence her in
[1:35:36] <alrobot2014> @HideousDeity handmaiden gets jealous and doesn't want to talk to you anymore after
[1:35:36] <dorpork> you can talk to Visas, you just have to make sure you don't gain more influence with her than you do with Handmaiden
[1:35:37] <indig0bird> Thumbs up!
[1:36:01] <%krispen_wa> i managed to talk to visas with only one handmaiden training session and somehow didn't piss her off
[1:36:05] <%Gruhunchously> @kekkerscrew (That's because V is blowing them out of proportion, you can talk to Visas as long as you don't get more influence with her than with Handmaiden)..
[1:36:05] <ralphfromdk> And now the droids are basicly immortal :D
[1:36:22] <+Superspider51> I've always talked to Visas without pissing Handmaiden off
[1:36:23] <Prophet_v3> !uptimeLength
[1:36:34] <+Superspider51> or at least if she was pissed off it didn't really affect anything
[1:37:02] <%Gruhunchously> @Superspider51 If you piss her off, she refuses to talk to you for the rest of the game, so I don't think you pissed her off.
[1:37:33] <+Llewelln> after getting the Handmaiden bonus it doesnt really matter now, unless he wants to have Handmaiden as Jedi
[1:37:34] <+Superspider51> figured as much, was still able to talk to Visas and finish up with the training
[1:37:48] <+Ixiah> Where is te Cube Woolie ???
[1:37:55] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Does Kriea have treat injury on her sheet?

[1:54:19] <+therabbles> Twerka Inc could use some new material
[1:54:19] <Redblood801> Have you heard of Twerka?

[1:55:08] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> oh I never realized the Mando Power shield was still a melee shield goddamit
[1:55:16] <jorniev> FOR MARVHEL
[1:55:16] <%Gruhunchously> @van_fair This game taught me to ALWAYS spec my companions right. Just in case.
[1:55:19] <%masterpiecejeremy> fight fuck threeway?
[1:55:31] <MayorRev> LET'S DANCE
[1:55:54] <%Gruhunchously> What is this power rave?
[1:55:58] <closetgremlin12> War of attrition
[1:56:13] <%Gruhunchously> Their shield will get worn down, but so will yours
[1:56:13] <derap41> Is this fight fucking
[1:56:16] <Graxe_> Look at those guys in the back
[1:56:19] <Graxe_> Just sitting there
[1:56:21] <%LiquidDinosaur> now THIS is fuck fighting!
[1:56:24] <%RioGascar> I remember child me somehow winning this
[1:56:33] <%Gruhunchously> Huh, she didn't get stunned
[1:56:34] <vulkan_vibes> this fight does suck
[1:56:34] <%RioGascar> cause i did not spect well
[1:56:35] <LeeOhX> Yikes that shield lasted way too long
[1:56:38] <+chiazam> he can do that from the quick menu right?
[1:56:42] <%Th3SmartAlec> ~Theme of Threeway~
[1:56:43] <%LiquidDinosaur> i set mines in here beforehand
[1:56:45] <$Sonikah> Cheer500 Woolie, you liked Watchmen, right? You should go read Worm (by Wildbow). It's a gritty superhero web serial about doing the wrong thing for the right reason. The book deconstructs the comic book genre and explores how similar heroes and villains really are. The main character's power is bug control, but she's smart enough with it to make up for her lack of obvious strength. There is a finished audiobook and a sequel being updated weekly.
[1:56:47] <+therabbles> i didn't have Jedi atton and that made this fight pretty tough
[1:56:49] <vulkan_vibes> you can get them stuck around a paak table
[1:56:56] <%optimasmaximas> she healed LUL
[1:56:58] <%Gruhunchously> The fuck is this? Enemies healing?
[1:57:00] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> this fight is really hard when you don't know what you doin
[1:57:02] <%RioGascar> I remember running into corners
[1:57:13] <Halospaz117> Convince her to save her healing items for later!
[1:57:13] <%RioGascar> And using spaces to lose line of sight
[1:57:14] <%GeneralSCPatton> @sonikah I think he already is
[1:57:20] <%RioGascar> And just healing by magic
[1:57:34] <KaitlynnHere> !uptime
[1:57:34] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 9 minutes
[1:57:42] <KaitlynnHere> KEKW
[1:57:43] <%Gruhunchously> You kind of have to pull Fann 'Ypak away from fights for anything to be a challenge at this point.
[1:57:44] <%RioGascar> It was also using shit tons of grenades
[1:57:44] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> I remember stealthing and putting mines down lol
[1:57:50] <closetgremlin12> ahh cut content
[1:57:51] <$Sonikah> Wait, is he reading Worm? I haven't been keeping up with the podcast
[1:57:58] <LeeOhX> I think its cool that the companions also fight battles without you AND win
[1:58:02] <Matermind0> I always hide behind the bar
[1:58:03] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> My Atton almost always never was jedi by now since I was dumb
[1:58:06] <giga_bit> Pretty sure you can cheese this fight by throwing grenades from behind the bar counter? It's been a while.
[1:58:08] <%Gruhunchously> Most bar fights don't look this awesome.
[1:58:21] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> yeah you can nade them around tables and stuff
[1:58:24] <%GeneralSCPatton> @sonikah I believe it was only mentioned when someone else donated to recommend it
[1:58:33] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> but this is way cooler than grenades
[1:58:35] <%Th3SmartAlec> Dancer [Nothing]
[1:58:36] <%RioGascar> I think I remember where i got the strat. I had the prima guide for this gsme cause i was ass at it
[1:58:37] <BallerSwagBro9k> @gruhunchously The drunk guys fighting just think it does LUL
[1:58:40] <+mighty_max_t> Two Bladez
[1:58:43] <Badgerconda_> Good swords that you will never use
[1:58:43] <$Sonikah> I guess great minds shill alike
[1:58:45] <%Gruhunchously> S W I P E
[1:58:50] <@Squdnate> You can cheese this fight by going behind on of the patreons table at the end of the bar, and throw nades
[1:58:55] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> OH SHIT more knowledge gained, I got those swords "later"
[1:58:59] <@Squdnate> Their AI doesn't path there for some reason
[1:59:02] <dorpork> they';re not missable, items dont disappear in this game
[1:59:04] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> I thought they didn't have drops here
[1:59:12] <dorpork> trhey always remain on the ground
[1:59:14] <%LiquidDinosaur> i guess you get doubles
[1:59:28] <professorno> I'm still on the first game; hasn't he been playing this for months? Why doesn't he have a lightsaber?
[1:59:29] <%Gruhunchously> Love the music btw
[1:59:43] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> oh I never went back for them there is just one other place to get them but not spoiling that of course
[1:59:47] <%Gruhunchously> @professorno He has a lightsaber, he literally just put it away
[1:59:57] <KaitlynnHere> He’s playing as one of the side characters
[1:59:57] <shutupandjam3465> he does have a lightsaber
[2:00:14] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> oh that's way easier than lightsabering lol
[2:00:20] <snakemuho> Master Rapid Shot + Master Speed > lightsabers
[2:00:22] <%GeneralSCPatton> @professorno Switched from saber to sword to bypass the energy shields
[2:00:24] <%Gruhunchously> It would be realistic if the rest of the bar patrons started gathering around and placing bets
[2:00:25] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> lol she drank estus so now I will duel over
[2:00:27] <LeafarOz> drug atton?
