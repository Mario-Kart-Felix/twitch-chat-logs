[0:22:14] <@Solidus_113> The game seems weirdly washed out
[0:22:22] <Pistachius> Edge!
[0:22:30] <derap41> @Solidus_113 Yeah Contrast seems low
[0:22:43] <arkv01> holy shit thats nuts
[0:23:04] <Mic1dl> Makes me wanna turn on my Dreamcast tonight and play this, Plasma Sword, and Power Stone
[0:23:08] <@SoushinSen> not a board game, it was a "light novel" mode
[0:23:21] <arkv01> @SoushinSen was there gameplay?
[0:23:24] <@SoushinSen> err i mean visual novel
[0:23:27] <KohryuZX> WRONG in Rival School it was a dating simulator
[0:23:30] <arkv01> or was it kinda like a blazblue affair
[0:23:31] <@SoushinSen> yes, like training
[0:23:40] <Varadox> The contrast is rather low.
[0:23:48] <KohryuZX> Project Justice was the one with the board game
[0:23:55] <Super_Voltekka> It also had a dating sim as its own sub game that also got axed from Western releases
[0:24:07] <mr_sups> I miss quick resets
[0:24:11] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus can anything be done about the brightness and contrast on stream?
[0:24:14] <%RioGascar> @woolieversus so if you had to setup the elgato for this all over again. What are chances you might have to do setup for a long time each time you start up?
[0:24:19] <%Klefth> Sad thing about the Dreamcast, though? That controller was ass...
[0:24:24] <+mister_rogers> roberto
[0:24:28] <GarbageNirvana> It was all about Roberto for me

[0:25:37] <+Plz_Bro> i feel ur pain
[0:25:38] <zamzoph> Why hasn't Woolie picked Akira yet?
[0:25:39] <Varadox> I went 1-35 in MvC3 online once.
[0:25:43] <Varadox> And it was my first time online.
[0:25:46] <+mister_rogers> you know what game that doesn't happen in
[0:25:49] <+mister_rogers> project justice
[0:25:59] <%CaptainPileDriver> yeah cause no one is online
[0:26:04] <Varadox> I was not going to leave until that other guy left.
[0:26:08] <+Plz_Bro> doesnt happen in melee much, but when it does, its really bad
[0:26:18] <FuqBoiSlim> some people just cant handle Ls. I was guilty of it once in a while
[0:26:22] <+mister_rogers> play some redggpo
[0:26:24] <%CaptainPileDriver> melee isn't online?
[0:26:29] <+mister_rogers> it is
[0:26:35] <zamzoph> the triple attack depends on the school of your controlling character

[0:31:03] <7c_nickel> If Woolies main isnt the Sukeban girl Im gonna riot.
[0:31:04] <%doomerskeletor13> PJSalt500 my game suggestion is Spider-Man PS4. Imo it’s the best superhero game, it’s well written and fun to play. The campaign isn’t too long, and I just think it would be fun to see you guys riff on Spoder-Man. Might be a good game if you ever need to fill a slot.
[0:31:07] <zamzoph> Woolie doesn't pick Akira?!

[0:34:00] <KaiserMario> I would honestly love if Street Fighter 6 had some of these characters back in their adult versions

[0:45:18] <Super_Voltekka> Fun Fact: Tips & Tricks trolled many a horny teen boy by printing the unlock requirements for Hinata's gym uniform in the first Rival Schools by saying it was actually her underwear
[0:45:31] <Azathotic> @WoolieVersus Did you see that Vanguard Princess is getting an Online Multiplayer update soon?
[0:45:43] <Super_Voltekka> I'm not making this up, it was posted in the PlayStation cheats section of the magazine
[0:45:47] <zamzoph> Akira Kreygasm
[0:46:23] <MasshuShirouchi> IIRC its double tapping sidestep?
[0:46:26] <KohryuZX> they probably thought it actually was her underwear

[0:48:32] <Super_Voltekka> It was in their codebooks from like the moment the game came out until around 2005 when they stopped showing PS1 cheats

[0:56:02] <KohryuZX> Hyo was behind the student disappearances and brainwashing that was taking place in Rival Schools, in project justice he was possessed by the vengeful spirit of his father through his broken blade and became demon Hyo, which was all a plan to bring Hyo's father back from the dead by the ninja clan that served Hyo's family
[0:56:52] <zenith0111> Where's that Akira tech?!
[0:57:19] <KohryuZX> Project Justice lore is pretty wild.

[0:58:16] <zenith0111> @kohryuzx That's some nutty plot
[0:58:18] <heartlesshealer> Lore is wild
[0:58:46] <zenith0111> Reggie got footsies? stickm12Pog
[0:58:53] <KohryuZX> The first game was about Hyo wanting to conquer the youth of Japan with brainwashing and Project Justice was about a ninja clan manipulating events to bring his father back from the dead
[0:58:53] <MasshuShirouchi> its simple enough to be like a 24 ep 90's anime or something though
[0:59:12] <%CaptainPileDriver> woolieFABRICATION_BE
[0:59:30] <zenith0111> Capcom master of picking up the ball and dropping it
[0:59:37] <+loukemia83> True or False: Akira is Skullomania
[0:59:45] <Super_Voltekka> Please tell me one of the custom characters is named Donald LUL
[1:00:09] <Pt_Kamen> Capcom drops good characters and pushes Fang, El Fuerte, Rufus, etc.
[1:00:15] <FuqBoiSlim> yeah that plot sounds like the story to a 4 episode OVA from the mid 90s. I love it
[1:00:24] <zenith0111> That jump height is insane wtf
[1:00:30] <Pt_Kamen> what about Big Bang Beat?
[1:00:30] <Azathotic> @loukemia83 False, Skullo is cooler
[1:00:36] <KohryuZX> It would defnitely make a great cheesy 90s anime, like Tenjou Tenge but actually fun
[1:00:43] <guymontag0> And you can’t say that pushed Fuerte. That guy got no action since SF4.
[1:00:59] <zenith0111> Omg
[1:01:01] <wydamn> This is such good music
[1:01:14] <Pt_Kamen> but el fuerte was a thing after this was dropped
[1:01:15] <FuqBoiSlim> El Fuerte is locked in the Capcom Dungeon. Along with Hakan and Decapre
[1:01:39] <zenith0111> He found the fish net shirt stickm12Pog

[1:08:11] <MasshuShirouchi> its a sequel
[1:08:25] <FuqBoiSlim> rival schools came out in '96 and Project Justice came out in 2000

[1:24:57] <%Ecchigun> woolie knows
[1:24:58] <+OmegaWeltall> yea they had fun making this game man... fuck i miss it
[1:25:00] <%CaptainPileDriver> the controller sucks
[1:25:00] <DMatts142> omg that Blanka face/head looks too much like Pat lmao
[1:25:05] <%Ecchigun> its all about the MUSIC
[1:25:18] <%Ecchigun> THE SOUNDS
[1:25:20] <+jiggy_snipe> CvS2 announcer was great
[1:25:25] <KINGRAV3> Jebaited
[1:25:29] <%CaptainPileDriver> eh
[1:25:33] <crimsonsaens> They're not old enough to have played this masterpiece
[1:25:37] <%Youknowwhyimhere008> woolieCHAN
[1:25:39] <%CaptainPileDriver> gimme cvs2 any day
[1:25:40] <FuqBoiSlim> You need a high IQ to understand CvS
[1:25:56] <zamzoph> DON'T SHAKE THEIR HANDS
[1:26:00] <+OmegaWeltall> do not look at Blanka players
[1:26:00] <+jiggy_snipe> ugh don't even talk to WOolie
[1:26:00] <zenith0111> ANTI AIR TECH
[1:26:05] <FuqBoiSlim> dont even look at them
[1:26:10] <%Ecchigun> AAaaaaaaaaaaaa
[1:26:16] <%CaptainPileDriver> WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT
[1:26:30] <MayorRev> DON'T MAKE EYE CONTACT
[1:26:48] <+OmegaWeltall> Cammy, Yuri, and King. Those were my girls
[1:26:59] <Super_Voltekka> Why'd they change Cammy's voice in CvS2, this sounds so much better
[1:27:09] <%Klefth> Cammy sounded like she had a hot potato in her mouth or something
[1:27:14] <zenith0111> If you do you must play them to a ft3 and you must not lose a single round
[1:27:25] <godspeedspacebat> they recorded her voice lines as she was falling off a cliff
[1:27:38] <%theluckyhero> theluckyhero subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! I had nothing fancy to write
[1:27:51] <iDunnoHowToWrite> bruh moment
[1:27:53] <FuqBoiSlim> Sagat says NO to turtling
[1:28:29] <FuqBoiSlim> Violent Ken?
[1:28:30] <Solidnick18> violent ken Kappa
[1:28:35] <Super_Voltekka> Hearing Cammy go from her CvS1 to CvS2 voice gave me flashbacks to Engrish Viewtiful Joe and Alex in TvC
[1:28:40] <Mordexai0> CvS1 arguably has presentation on par with CvS2
[1:28:48] <zenith0111> Yo wtf Ratio system?
[1:28:58] <%CaptainPileDriver> yeah, what the fuck is the ratio system
[1:29:09] <Solidnick18> yamazaki
[1:29:10] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus what is the ratio system
[1:29:16] <+OmegaWeltall> the LOVE man... the love BibleThump
[1:29:19] <FuqBoiSlim> KINO
[1:29:24] <@Solidus_113> It's the Skullgirls team size select
[1:29:28] <FuqBoiSlim> THAT INTRO WAS LITERAL KINO
[1:29:35] <%CaptainPileDriver> is it?
[1:29:36] <heartlesshealer> <3
[1:29:45] <WarchiefGoldva> Remember when Capcom and SNK were the kings of fighting games?
[1:29:46] <%CaptainPileDriver> cause some characters were more slots tha others
[1:29:54] <+OmegaWeltall> I 'member
[1:29:59] <WarchiefGoldva> This much love is what they were capable of.
[1:30:06] <mr_miyagucci> yeah thats where the inspiration for skullgirls team size select came from the more slots you take the more buff you are
[1:30:11] <Solidnick18> goooo yamazaki
[1:30:15] <mr_miyagucci> everyone gets four total slots
[1:30:19] <%CaptainPileDriver> okay
[1:30:19] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:30:25] <+TheBesteban> Each character is assigned 1 - 4 points, indicating their strength of attack and defense. You can only have 4 points on a team. So you can mix and match rations 1, 2, and 3s or just have one ratio 4 character @CaptainPileDriver
[1:30:26] <FuqBoiSlim> Grape Yamakazi PogChamp
[1:30:36] <heartlesshealer> !
[1:30:40] <zenith0111> LORE
[1:30:41] <laserbeaming> Do SNK characters have shorthops in this game?
[1:30:42] <Solidnick18> PogChampp
[1:30:45] <%CaptainPileDriver> thank you @TheBesteban
[1:30:49] <mr_miyagucci> in this game different characters take up different amounts of slots but in cvs2 you can choose the ratio
[1:30:54] <guymontag0> I’m glad they expanses the roster in the second game. Barring Nakoruru and Morrigan, it was just SF vs KOF.
[1:30:56] <%CaptainPileDriver> okay that makes sense now
[1:30:56] <artoflec> there is nobody cooler than Terry Bogard
[1:31:02] <JmosesX> What up Woolie, Reggie, and chat. How we all doing on this fine day?

[1:32:32] <WarchiefGoldva> I just read on Youtube that Gamestop calls itself "essential retail" and refuses to shut down stores despite lockdown and poor hygiene.

[1:32:49] <@Solidus_113> bless
[1:32:53] <DesDavis> CHECK THE SHADOWS
[1:33:07] <Super_Voltekka> They did my girl King wrong when they needed the shit out of her in CvS2
[1:33:09] <+croxeye> damn those shadows
[1:33:17] <Super_Voltekka> *nerfed
[1:33:20] <+JM_FUNK> best presentation in a fighting game ever.

[1:33:24] <arkv01> FUCKING ENGLISH COWARDS
[1:33:32] <nevan_44> LUL
[1:33:36] <guymontag0> The presentation in this game was way better than CVS2.

[1:33:48] <arkv01> holy shit those SHADOWS
[1:34:05] <mr_sups> I want to see another fighting game do that

[1:34:15] <crimsonsaens> Vega vs Genocide Cutter sounds rough
[1:34:18] <sackerkappa> How old is this game?
[1:34:18] <%Youknowwhyimhere008> atpRtsd
[1:34:19] <+TopTieramisu> rugal is the sickest boss in fighting games
[1:34:28] <guymontag0> To the windows, to the wall!
[1:34:35] <heartlesshealer> 2000
[1:34:38] <@Solidus_113> MORRIGAN
[1:34:41] <+ghostfaceninja_> Kreygasm skeet skeet
[1:34:56] <+necrocannibal2> Johnny Cage has swearing in one of his round win animations, which is probably why you can only use the default ones in tournament settings
[1:34:56] <Thalchampz> og REGGIE
[1:34:57] <Solidnick18> mai Kreygasm
[1:34:59] <heartlesshealer> at least that was the year number I saw on the title screen

[1:35:05] <+necrocannibal2> Morrigan Kreygasm

[1:35:14] <zamzoph> MILLIONS DEAD
[1:35:15] <FuqBoiSlim> I WANT THE OG MOR
[1:35:16] <zenith0111> YO WTF
[1:35:23] <sackerkappa> Damn... This is from 2000 and Third Strike is from '99... The craft and detail in their presentation still holds up over 20 years later.
[1:35:25] <zenith0111> STAGE INTRO WAS SSS TIER
[1:35:25] <heartlesshealer> <3
[1:35:29] <FuqBoiSlim> Morrigang where u at???
[1:35:31] <+solzan2000> the intro are hot asf
[1:35:37] <arkv01> let no one dispute 90s FGC was PEAK
[1:35:44] <%Youknowwhyimhere008> PogChamp
[1:35:49] <zenith0111> INSANE
[1:35:50] <sackerkappa> Art in motion.
[1:35:51] <+jiggy_snipe> 90s and early 00s
[1:35:54] <Solidnick18> True love making
[1:35:56] <FuqBoiSlim> They didnt have snap so hard tho
[1:35:57] <Mordexai0> CVS1 OUT SHINING CVS2 HERE
[1:35:58] <+TeethMuncher> This is hedonism
[1:36:01] <heartlesshealer> And it changes sides on them depending on where they are relative to the background fire!
[1:36:09] <mr_slaide> WE LOVE YOU, WOOLIE!
[1:36:11] <JmosesX> This game was made with all the love a fighting game could get
[1:36:15] <FuqBoiSlim> I got nothing to say. capcom snapped with this one
[1:36:18] <laserbeaming> But Woolie, this much love cost MOOONEY
[1:36:32] <+TopTieramisu> and to reciprocate, snk made SvC Chaos atpRtsd
[1:36:33] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[1:36:33] <Super_Voltekka> Why are the PS ports of this game so bad tho?
[1:36:36] <zenith0111> WTF
[1:36:38] <nevan_44> LUL
[1:36:39] <%Klefth> LUL
[1:36:43] <CalderGaming> "3rd strike morrigan"
[1:36:44] <crimsonsaens> I can't believe CvS2 killed Capcom fighting games for a decade
[1:36:49] <+croxeye> LUL i love the story
[1:36:51] <heartlesshealer> the pain of the guy who made that morrigan sprite that kept getting used
[1:36:56] <+necrocannibal2> IORI IS THE FUCKING BEST
[1:36:56] <+TeethMuncher> That sprite is older than some people watching this
[1:36:58] <GeltonZ> @TopTieramisu Hey they made Match of the Millenium first, which is the best Capcom vs SNK game anyway.
[1:36:59] <%Sparkseid> F
[1:37:00] <nevan_44> YEAH
[1:37:01] <$SilverRoddo> You can smell the savings on this stage.
[1:37:02] <zenith0111> THAT DAMAGE
[1:37:02] <+necrocannibal2> I FUCKING LOVE HIM
[1:37:08] <Mordexai0> @toptieramisu Yeah but we got Violent Ken outta that so it's fine.
[1:37:09] <FuqBoiSlim> @super_voltekka is the ps2 classic version of cvs2 bad?
[1:37:15] <Leonheart777> Morrigan sprite will outlive all of us LUL
[1:37:29] <+KineKithZen> GiefStaresAt
[1:37:29] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:37:29] <1AbuOmar1> how long have we been streaming guys?
[1:37:30] <guymontag0> Fun Fact: Iori dislikes violence
[1:37:31] <sackerkappa> This one and CvS 2 is where all the male portraits are essentially George Clooney, right?
[1:37:34] <crimsonsaens> Love for everything, except Morrigan's sprite
[1:37:36] <+OmegaWeltall> Geef looking lilke Big Show LUL
[1:37:37] <+necrocannibal2> they really don't
[1:37:47] <Mordexai0> @sackerkappa lol
[1:37:51] <Solidnick18> Yoooo
[1:37:56] <+TopTieramisu> violent ken and the absolute worst version of athena atpRtsd1
[1:37:58] <+solzan2000> these intros lol
[1:37:58] <$SilverRoddo> Bishi Bison.
[1:37:59] <zenith0111> STAGE INTROSSS
[1:38:08] <+jjsmack> Cvs 1? Wat
[1:38:10] <sackerkappa> Zangief is going to piledrive that train, isn't he?
[1:38:16] <KaiserMario> If Reggie loses this one HE SUCKS
[1:38:17] <Super_Voltekka> Guile's Alpha 3 stage? What are YOU doing here????????
[1:38:33] <FuqBoiSlim> The last star in the universe could finally supernova and within the infinite abyss of black. you could still hear "Soul Fist!" coming from the distance
[1:38:33] <GeltonZ> Yeah CvS1 has way better presentation. It just has a shit roster and a turbo shit Ratio System. WHY IS VEGA A RATIO 3?!?!?!?!
[1:38:42] <KaiserMario> YOU SUCK REGGIE lul
[1:38:42] <zenith0111> No 360s?!
[1:39:15] <crimsonsaens> What is Charlotta doing here?
[1:39:26] <%CaptainPileDriver> reggie is honda
[1:39:30] <SoromopsEX> TRANS BISON
[1:39:35] <RAPHCOM> Awwwwww snap!!!
[1:39:39] <+necrocannibal2> @Soromops5050 LUL
[1:39:41] <WarchiefGoldva> Charl's looking a little differentt han I remember.
[1:39:48] <$SilverRoddo> Punishment colors.
[1:39:49] <guymontag0> The first game where Norio Wakamoto voices Bison I believe
[1:40:03] <+OmegaWeltall> LOVE that EX throw
[1:40:04] <%CaptainPileDriver> and yes, reggie does suck
[1:40:09] <Thalchampz> that throw is so good
[1:40:11] <FuqBoiSlim> That's the same color scheme Matt uses for is Skeletonsona LUL
[1:40:14] <+DrThwack> is that bison attempting to do iori's rekkas? lmao
[1:40:19] <hookhis> that gief is nsfw
[1:40:21] <FuqBoiSlim> *his Skelesona
[1:40:28] <+TopTieramisu> norio wakamoto also voiced rugal in kof 2k2
[1:40:38] <+TopTieramisu> and also igniz in 2k1 iirc
[1:40:46] <sackerkappa> Vanessa from SNK isn't in this game, is she?
[1:40:48] <%RioGascar> Man it would sure be cool if capcom and snk did a vs again huh
[1:40:49] <%Klefth> Man, SFEX and EX2 were sick
[1:40:54] <+TopTieramisu> nah, vanessa was never in a crossover
[1:40:58] <%Klefth> Best damn soundtrack, too
[1:41:07] <zenith0111> Wait these games didn't do well?
[1:41:10] <guymontag0> Technically KOF is a crossover
[1:41:22] <+TopTieramisu> it started as a crossover that became its own thing
[1:41:24] <+OmegaWeltall> naw these game didnt do well... people have shit taste
[1:41:37] <%CaptainPileDriver> basically
[1:41:37] <%RioGascar> sounds like capcom flooded their own market
[1:41:43] <arkv01> I mean
[1:41:45] <mr_sups> Now Ruru is in KOF
[1:41:49] <+TeethMuncher> Just like my fanfic
[1:41:50] <Prevot> capcom vs snk is also a better name than SF vs kof
[1:41:50] <KaiserMario> Nakoruru is in KOF now...
[1:41:52] <arkv01> nakoruru is more KOF than her own game at this point
[1:41:55] <+necrocannibal2> tbf KOF is SNK vs SNK
[1:41:57] <FuqBoiSlim> yeah that's happened during the arcade days I feel
[1:42:11] <+TopTieramisu> is there lore for why nakoruru is in kof?
[1:42:11] <Mordexai0> Nakoruru now a KoF character LUL
[1:42:11] <+necrocannibal2> so it's Capcom vs. (SNK vs. SNK)
[1:42:19] <WarchiefGoldva> I can't stop noticing how twiggy Nakoruru looks.
[1:42:21] <+TopTieramisu> some time portal shenanigans?
[1:42:44] <%Klefth> Guile sounding like KOF engrish is amazing
[1:42:58] <+TopTieramisu> sonic bleur
[1:43:04] <+chiazam> Whiff punish
[1:43:06] <guymontag0> @toptieramisu Ash dying in KOF 13 fucked a bunch of things up. Nakoruru and her team came to there because of it.
[1:43:23] <%CaptainPileDriver> what's the difference between the snk and capcom grooves? like different motions or what?
[1:43:25] <%RioGascar> I also imagine sprite artists were starting to get hard to find
[1:43:35] <heartlesshealer> this is too hype for me to catch live, I need to show it to friend once stream's done and there's a vod
[1:43:40] <+TeethMuncher> @guymontag0 is 13 non-cannon because of the paradox?
[1:43:44] <DesDavis> tha pants Kreygasm
[1:43:49] <heartlesshealer> he loves fighting games and needs to know
[1:43:52] <+TopTieramisu> reusing assets has always been practiced in games
[1:43:55] <rcgama> Yo its best pants man
[1:44:02] <Mordexai0> KoF really is an SNK crossover so it's Street Fighter vs SNK featuring Morrigan from the Darkstalkers series
[1:44:05] <WarchiefGoldva> It's scientifically proven that Kim's power grows the more the detail on his pants exist.
[1:44:14] <FuqBoiSlim> I mean if it still looks good. why not?
[1:44:15] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[1:44:17] <%RioGascar> True but reusing sprites to my understanding is quite a different matter
[1:44:18] <arkv01> LUL
[1:44:20] <+croxeye> BRUH
[1:44:20] <zenith0111> YO
[1:44:22] <+TopTieramisu> let's be real, these pants don't hold a candle to kof's treatment pre-3d
[1:44:24] <FuqBoiSlim> monkaS
[1:44:29] <Super_Voltekka> I can see why they shortened it in the next game
[1:44:29] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1239789488349614081?s=20
[1:44:31] <%RioGascar> its not just oh we can recolor this spirte or size it up
[1:44:36] <SoromopsEX> Kim is most powerful in KoF13
[1:44:37] <%RioGascar> or change some things easily
[1:44:49] <arkv01> no choica amigo
[1:44:51] <$SilverRoddo> I ‘member GamePro magazine put out an article regarding Street Fighter 2 character having new moves, like, Guile whipping out a pistol, Blanka throwing lightning projectiles and Dhalsim having a head for a foot.
[1:44:53] <%CaptainPileDriver> @Soromops5050 i thought mr karate was top?
[1:45:06] <sackerkappa> Death by eagle.
[1:45:16] <+TopTieramisu> @CaptainPileDriver i think he means out of all the kims
[1:45:17] <%CaptainPileDriver> is kim really that fucking good in kof13?
[1:45:22] <CalderGaming> @CaptainPileDriver going off what I remember from CvS2, the capcom grooves take maneuvers and meter mechanics from SF alpha, 3rd strike, etc. while the SNK grooves take maneuvers and meter mechanics from KOF, Samsho, etc.
[1:45:22] <+TeethMuncher> @CaptainPileDriver it's a toss up between ex iori, karate and kim
[1:45:22] <guymontag0> @teethmuncher As far as I know, the tournament still happens. And I believe Elizabeth’s team were the winners. Don’t quote me on it though.

[2:51:27] <leomuratore> God bless the Dreamcast
[2:51:29] <majima666> dreamcast is awesome
[2:51:40] <@Solidus_113> I've never seen a dreamcast in my life
[2:51:43] <Super_Voltekka> They made a sequel on the Xbox
[2:51:44] <taquito_blade> @Ecchigun you missed out on some good times
[2:51:44] <%jetjagger222> GD-rom i think
[2:51:49] <majima666> gd rom
[2:51:55] <majima666> it was 1gb
[2:52:00] <%CaptainPileDriver> the controller suucks
[2:52:00] <%jetjagger222> the pirated versions had less data as a result
[2:52:09] <%jetjagger222> i had some games which had no music
[2:52:29] <Talinu> Isn't that what nintendo does now?
[2:52:40] <%CaptainPileDriver> fuck that controller
[2:52:47] <fuji_92> dreamcast DansGame
[2:52:49] <TalisKanju> Also, SEGA screwed the Saturn
[2:52:50] <majima666> the controller is ass
[2:52:52] <BeijiWeng> real and true
[2:52:53] <SomersaultJustice> seriously though, that controller goes straight in the trash
[2:53:00] <%jetjagger222> VMU
[2:53:01] <Hoarseplay> Sega basically did everything in their power to internally sabotage their own company.
[2:53:04] <majima666> for a system that has a load of 2d fighters too lol
[2:53:09] <%CaptainPileDriver> oh yay, a better controller
[2:53:09] <%jetjagger222> wasn't it bernie stolar's fault
[2:53:24] <+LegendaryDorkKnight> true
[2:53:32] <SomersaultJustice> Soul Calibur!
[2:53:33] <%CaptainPileDriver> confirmed reggie and woolie down to touch more

[2:53:49] <%RioGascar> Down for touching
[2:53:54] <%CaptainPileDriver> big touching
[2:53:55] <%jetjagger222> plasma sword!
[2:53:56] <Hoarseplay> What did Bernie Stolar even do other than fighting games?
[2:53:56] <arkv01> best way to defend against the virus? Keep your throat moisturized
[2:54:02] <TalisKanju> Bernie Stolar didn't help, but the early release date killed the system before it had a chance
[2:54:04] <Axle13j> Beer count?
[2:54:06] <%CaptainPileDriver> foot touching REGGIE
[2:54:10] <DaRoosta89> YO REGGIE WITH A BEARD PogChamp

[2:54:16] <+SoundShower> Got a bit of a soft spot for Tech Romancer :)
[2:54:23] <%jetjagger222> star gladiator was ass, but plasma sword was kinda like rival schools with lightsabers
[2:54:31] <Super_Voltekka> Plasma Sword wen?
[2:54:37] <fuji_92> all the warriors
[2:54:41] <+KNYGHT87> woolieSMUG_RB
[2:54:45] <majima666> if sega released a fight pad for the dc that was basically the saturn/megadrive 6 button pad
[2:54:46] <@chesterr01> @daroosta89 HeyGuys
[2:54:50] <SomersaultJustice> we can watch that cool animated GGX intro
[2:54:52] <Hoarseplay> The Saturn release was a Sega JAP decision.
[2:54:56] <%jetjagger222> @SoundShower tech romancer is badass

[2:55:27] <%jetjagger222> @SoundShower the title didn't do it any favors though; it sounded like a dating sim
