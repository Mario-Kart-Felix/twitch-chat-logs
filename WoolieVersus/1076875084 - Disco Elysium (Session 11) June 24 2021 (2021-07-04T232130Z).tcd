[0:03:01] <+ReallyBigRocks> We'll have to switch from flagpoles to flagholes
[0:03:02] <%MrKerb> Ireland had a similar thing as well
[0:03:05] <aiutare47> 4,000?!?!
[0:03:12] <%LCLSmoothie> holy crap
[0:03:13] <nakunattakage> People mistreating indigenous children, right?
[0:03:15] <spaceitaly> almost feels like you shouldn’t be flying the flag at this point
[0:03:21] <+ABakedDemon> @nakunattakage limesGun agreed limesGun

[0:03:46] <%BallerSwagBro9k> That's warped as fuck
[0:03:47] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Genocide
[0:03:51] <+ABakedDemon> limesKnife limesOk
[0:03:51] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ah yes erase the culture
[0:03:52] <+ReallyBigRocks> Same thing happened in the US
[0:03:53] <BourneWarrior> Chat has been COMPROMISED
[0:03:53] <aiutare47> “We’ll educate the savage out of them”
[0:03:53] <ToxInjection> Turns out our history is ALSO dark and filled with discrimination! Woo
[0:03:56] <nakunattakage> limesKnife
[0:03:57] <+Reverend_Roscoe> genocide as fuck
[0:04:05] <%CappuccinoGuil> So genocide
[0:04:09] <andre11dr> And it probably went wrong
[0:04:14] <%LCLSmoothie> genocide basically
[0:04:14] <coreybom> American here. Our Government is prepping to do the same. Who knows how many we have since we’re a much larger country. BibleThump
[0:04:17] <skyenoz> Wait so how do you know 4000 kids are dead?
[0:04:19] <andre11dr> Well it clearly went wrong
[0:04:21] <ASovietSharkPro> it's a CULTURAL genocide
[0:04:22] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @BourneWarrior we've always beem compromised
[0:04:22] <%krispen_wa> Cultural and actual genocide
[0:04:24] <%specters_art88> Same thing happened in America with native Americans and Hawaiians.
[0:04:26] <ronin19xx> Cultural genocide
[0:04:31] <+vaderxyz1970> the slow burn
[0:04:33] <Balcazaurus> breaks my heart
[0:04:33] <Chatterbox1991> Don't forget the recent stories of that Hospital who conducted forced sterilizations of native women
[0:04:33] <+Rookie_Balboa> but then what about the graves?
[0:04:37] <iacus_> I mean, that's preferable to outright massacre, non?
[0:04:38] <+thayerunchained> GOOD JOB HUMANITY
[0:04:41] <%Vigonept> they still killed the kids tho, so it fits
[0:04:44] <%CappuccinoGuil> Well, cultural and literal, we're finding dead children in mass graves.
[0:04:55] <+Nurff> Catholics and child abuse classic combo
[0:05:01] <nakunattakage> rampant abuse and no oversight/accountability limesFeels
[0:05:05] <ToxInjection> But ALSO mass graves
[0:05:07] <%wardogleader15> wardogleader15 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! I'm here for this, excite
[0:05:18] <yomamma133713> all of the above?
[0:05:36] <+vaderxyz1970> this sounds like info lost on purpose
[0:05:51] <Fuji808> Native Hawaiian here. They made speaking Hawaiian, dancing hula, surfing, and practicing Native Hawaiian traditions culturally taboo and punished children and families who practiced. Our culture was almost gone forever.
[0:05:58] <Equirah> children don't change, start questioning things and you "stop" that before it spreads
[0:05:59] <notadeasterisk> wouldn't they be adopted?
[0:06:04] <skyenoz> But where did the 4000 number come from?
[0:06:07] <%CappuccinoGuil> As someone from a country where catholic conversion was a thing for century, sorry to break it to you, killing them WAS the curriculum
[0:06:10] <linSP> someone at the camps misinterpreted cultural genocide for Hitler mode
[0:06:11] <+ABakedDemon> Murder the child murderers limesKnife
[0:06:47] <diddlydaddlydoo> damn i missed the first part of this conversation. did they find more bodies at some of the other camps in quebec??
[0:06:50] <andre11dr> It's probably job racist people killing them because there was nothing to protect them
[0:06:52] <%CappuccinoGuil> @skyenoz it's an estimation of how many will be found across Canada.
[0:06:53] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:07:09] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @abakeddemon Sadly they're all long dead
[0:07:14] <+Tuffty> Living in N.Ireland, sounds like this should be a way bigger story all over the world. First time hearing about this fucked up situation. Sorry to hear.
[0:07:14] <ASovietSharkPro> My question is... why is it considered "Westernization" if... they were native to the West BEFORE the "Westerners"
[0:07:25] <yomamma133713> @diddlydaddlydoo new site 3x more than the other one
[0:07:32] <%wolfofsound> the church covering something up? Naaaaaaah
[0:07:38] <pi_in_the_sci> I just got here, are we talking about Canada killing thousands of native children and then pretending that wasn't the whole plan?
[0:07:41] <LlewynMarie> there's a good vox video on the youtube that talks about this but in the 50s-60s and with adoption.
[0:07:46] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @ASovietSharkPro bc everythimg is always from european POV
[0:08:07] <andre11dr> Also apparently a bunch of Native Americans died from diseases the Europeans had
[0:08:08] <diddlydaddlydoo> @diddlydaddlydoo jesus christ.... i mean it figures there would have been way more but damn....
[0:08:09] <linSP> I get the feeling Canada church burned all the records on this event
[0:08:23] <CaptainBright> Truly the cursed thinking of the moralinterns and O C C I D E N T A L I S M
[0:08:28] <skyenoz> @cappuccinoguil but how did they get an estimation? like did they take the number of dead kids and multiply it with the number of places they did the conversions
[0:08:32] <%CappuccinoGuil> Fucking R E P A R A T I ON S
[0:08:37] <%servicesuspension> cancel canada day, or the day in which canada is cancelled
[0:08:37] <iacus_> because the earth is a ball so anything can be to the "west" of anything
[0:08:51] <+thayerunchained> they "lost" all of the records, how convenient
[0:09:08] <+chase959> Make native studies mandatory in high school. Not an elective

[0:09:13] <%CappuccinoGuil> @skyenoz don't know, I'm just quoting what Woolie said.
[0:09:22] <Dova573> But woolie we should scare our children with history
[0:09:25] <+LordAngry> catholic church stole babies as a living wall of hostages against uprising of first nations, and then killled them anyway.

[0:09:53] <%wolfofsound> most fucked up thing yet*
[0:09:55] <+FlubbedPig> The weirdest thing that put it into perspective for me is that the last residential school was shut down the year I was born. It is NOT ancient history from colonial times.
[0:09:58] <kikoeru_san> oh we talkin about the child mass graves
[0:09:59] <Blackleafx> What about Duplessis? Just in terms of fucked up Quebecois history
[0:09:59] <ronin19xx> This takes the cake
[0:10:03] <Ziegsy> @vaderxyz1970 they dont aply to war-crimes, due to the nature of the fact war can go on for a long time

[0:10:43] <andre11dr> Yeah history is pretty dark

[0:11:46] <+meniscate> Also gotta talk about the mass exploitation and torture of animals tho
[0:11:52] <CaptainBright> @leith_aziz guess who drew up the maps of the current nations of the middle-east?
[0:11:54] <+EternalJedi> patriotism doesn't involve blind obedience
[0:11:56] <+CromotusZer0> Woolie speaking facts.
[0:11:58] <Blackleafx> @CaptainBright Basically Britain and France carving up the Middle East into "oh that chunks mine" "that ones mine"

[0:12:52] <ASovietSharkPro> My personal belief is fuck everyone history is a lie
[0:12:52] <Ziegsy> 'Oh but its better now' doesnt mean shit

[0:13:20] <aiutare47> Not to sound like “you think that’s bad” but all the stuff you’re talking about is really common in the US. Like the idea of “your government fucking kills people” is just inherent to everything. Right up there with the blind nationalism.

[0:13:40] <Parapattern> But I'M the special protagonist! And that means MY people must be the special protagonist people!
[0:13:41] <iacus_> big brain is to just accept that the past is what it is. It's pointless to judge it my contemporary morals
[0:13:47] <+Undenizen> @ronin19xx i didn't notice it but that IS a nice hoodie
[0:13:53] <%MrAtheGreat> It’s only a big deal if someone makes a big deal about it, and a lot of pathetic people would rather big deals not be made.

[0:18:04] <%CappuccinoGuil> YO, STEAM SUMMER SALE TIME
[0:18:04] <+vaderxyz1970> But Woolie ME though
[0:18:05] <%krispen_wa> LUL
[0:18:06] <leith_aziz> There's also a DLC story, so now's not the time

[0:18:21] <%extradopeness> i showed my roommates the strive story mode they are in on it
[0:18:23] <+ReallyBigRocks> No Woolie, you can never stop working
[0:18:28] <picanoturna> stop hating
[0:18:35] <ASovietSharkPro> Bro I NEEEEED more content to CONSUME

[0:19:11] <+ABakedDemon> vargSkell
[0:19:12] <twohitgood> it's kinda crazy to me that roboky has a relatively featured role in xrd's story but isn't playable.
[0:19:17] <Dakuu75> @WoolieVersus Do you or Reggie like coffee?
[0:19:22] <%ZweihanderSteve> hell yeah breaks are good
[0:19:30] <leith_aziz> @twohitgood That's actually an issue I have with Strive. A LOT of modes dont give you much in terms of rewards
[0:19:53] <%servicesuspension> do the entire thing as shorts
[0:19:53] <%krispen_wa> Whens playable Gabriel
[0:19:56] <leith_aziz> @twohitgood I heard that Ariels and Robo Ky were planned to be DLC in Xrd, but budget was not enough
[0:20:10] <IzanagiNoOokami> Release the Woolie cut.
[0:20:11] <twohitgood> @leith_aziz it's also kinda disappointing because the past games did give you rewards for finishing the story mode.
[0:20:23] <%CappuccinoGuil> @WeepyDevil sheesh, bro, you doing alright? Sounds like you got some stuff going on there D:
[0:20:25] <leith_aziz> Crawl will probably be Happy Chaos' theme
[0:20:28] <Trace_Bovier> yo we almost ready for the SADNESS
[0:20:28] <Teyaric> but that means no goddamn rollups
[0:20:37] <%LCLSmoothie> it’s my first GG game so i wanna watch your lord video, thanks for the videos!
[0:20:37] <%MrAtheGreat> Since we’re on this, I just want to thank you for making the Heaven or Hell series. I’ve been wanting to jump into the Guilty Gear series for some time now but always felt like I’d be lost if I did. Now I’m saving up for Strive. Thanks Woolie!
[0:20:55] <leith_aziz> @twohitgood I know, I played Xrd Rev 2. I also miss some of the extra thing to unlock in collection like the interviews and extra colors
[0:20:55] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:21:04] <%krispen_wa> Is full power Sol on the level of Slayer?
[0:21:04] <DatAsuna> poutine day?
[0:21:08] <%Subtlevictory> how much of a cut do you get if i buy a tshirt?
[0:21:15] <Johannen> What are curds?
[0:21:20] <passserby> can't wait to find out the riveting story to who Kum is in Xrd
[0:21:21] <leith_aziz> oof
[0:21:21] <+mechslayer71> Hit the car and it’s contents first tho
[0:21:22] <picanoturna> diabetes
[0:21:24] <twohitgood> fuck yeah the series was good. I enjoy woolie narration, in general.
[0:21:24] <%LCLSmoothie> all i knew prior playing GG is that people *really* liked baiken
[0:21:31] <+askalta> I finally found a cbd balm that helps my sciatic
[0:21:36] <WeepyDevil> @CappuccinoGuil i mean yes, but for Steam Summer Sale its jsut that the deals have gotten less crazy each year, and by this point most people should have every game they want on steam aside from new releases, which as previously mentioend aren't going to be that cheap
[0:21:46] <%livlinn> hellooooo wooliePOYO
[0:21:47] <leith_aziz> @LCLSmoothie She's that one character you know of before getting into GG
[0:21:54] <ASovietSharkPro> Sol Badguy is THE strongest ever, as visually shown by the many belts
[0:21:59] <%wolfofsound> enjoying being normal is great
[0:22:14] <leith_aziz> Sol is honestly probably the best FG protaganist aside from maybe Scorpiom
[0:22:16] <%servicesuspension> I'm ok, and that's as good as I'll ever be
[0:22:16] <picanoturna> normal pills
[0:22:18] <leith_aziz> *Scorpion
[0:22:19] <%extradopeness> yeah my roommate knows nothing about GG but she knows Baiken
[0:22:27] <exnuart> mordhau tho
[0:22:29] <Johannen> Chivalry is not For Honor
[0:22:35] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Chivalry 2 is buggy AF LUL
[0:22:36] <%wolfofsound> It is not LUL
[0:22:40] <%krispen_wa> Ragna is the best protag because he REALLY doesnt want to be there
[0:22:41] <%LordSDB> Thats a nice hoodie( hoodie sweater?) woolieCHAN
[0:22:48] <leith_aziz> I heard Chivalry 2 is hilarious as hell
[0:22:50] <DatAsuna> you can use the honor system but you might also just get gangtackled
[0:22:50] <%ZweihanderSteve> swing first!
[0:22:54] <%kewlmyc> Chivalry 2 is stupid fun
[0:22:59] <Johannen> For Honor is a fighting game while Chivalry is FPS in demival times
[0:23:08] <%X2Eliah> Looks like a poncho with a hood
[0:23:08] <%wolfofsound> @leith_aziz it is, I played alot of the original and it keeps the same feeling
[0:23:10] <ASovietSharkPro> Chivalry 2 is FUN, but you have to put in EFFORT to duel people
[0:23:11] <DatAsuna> it's vaguely jedi academy esque
[0:23:21] <%krispen_wa> is chivalry 2 the one where people go DODGE THIS YOU BASTAAAAAARD?
[0:23:23] <+fentry> fentry subscribed with Prime. 
[0:23:24] <DatAsuna> less mobility but with the directional slashing while moving

[0:23:35] <%livlinn> NotLikeThis
[0:23:40] <%CappuccinoGuil> @WeepyDevil That's a fair point, but it does ignore that it's not an objective thing that applies to everyone. There are lots of games I couldn't afford at full price, but at 60% off, heck yeah I'm excited to get them. It can be enjoyable, even if things aren't like, 90% off across the board.
[0:23:50] <%extradopeness> chivalry is indeed the game where people scream a lot
[0:23:51] <leith_aziz> oof
[0:23:57] <%derpy_platypus> OTHER is scary
[0:23:59] <pi_in_the_sci> Kill the savage, save the child . . . oops, missed one

[0:24:02] <DickeyTM> DOO,
[0:24:03] <DickeyTM> M
[0:24:08] <Indigo_Automaton> Yeah For Honor is a fighting game, Mordhau and Chivalary are Medieval FPS combat simulators
[0:24:18] <leith_aziz> The sad thing is that it's very true
[0:24:23] <wibbwobbler> Convert or die is still pretty prevalent

[0:47:43] <Blackleafx> if you go communist
[0:47:43] <ronin19xx> So in depth
[0:47:47] <picanoturna> delicious lore
[0:47:49] <+eanscrale> The RCM may descend from the remnants of the ICM
[0:47:50] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> That Tolkein style depth
[0:47:51] <LlewynMarie> they thought of everything it seems
[0:47:53] <GarbageNirvana> That's, like, Tolkien levels of worldbuilding
[0:47:53] <drunken_lemur> Oh, lore?
[0:47:56] <%kewlmyc> I mean, this world had an entire book before this game apparently
[0:47:56] <+Jeshk0> a tasty little sprinkle
[0:47:57] <aiutare47> 2 seems like an objectively bad way of breaking down a hierarchy

[0:50:09] <picanoturna> dont you spoil it woolie

[0:52:54] <BerryliciousDefinition> oof
[0:52:55] <glorioushedonist> just hair of the dog
[0:53:11] <%CappuccinoGuil> @servicesuspension you do a little better every day. Not good. Better.
[0:53:11] <nakunattakage> NotLikeThis
[0:53:14] <ToxInjection> Don't tell AA that, maybe LUL
[0:53:21] <Dakuu75> yep
[0:53:28] <Chatterbox1991> Addictions can be beaten, the reason why people become addicted can't
[0:53:30] <+MightyDuckShoes> Man, fuck AA
[0:53:40] <%krispen_wa> COPIUM
[0:53:41] <%servicesuspension> @CappuccinoGuil not denying it, it's just never good to think you're over it completely, whatever the addiction may be
[0:53:41] <mr_sups> Play the Anthony Bourdain Quote
[0:53:43] <Dakuu75> you just try building defense against your addiction
[0:53:46] <MinersLoveGames> There's recovering alcoholics, but ex-alcoholic is something completely different. My cousin's recovering, but fell off the wagon recently.
[0:53:47] <Equirah> reggie, you don't get rid of it
[0:53:49] <Daxalog> That blows
[0:53:50] <+DekeZander> there are no ex-addicts
[0:53:52] <GarbageNirvana> It's a legitimate handicap
[0:53:53] <Johannen> Born with Alchoholism? WUT
[0:53:53] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> The 12 step program is weird
[0:53:54] <%CappuccinoGuil> @servicesuspension oh for sure, I agree.
[0:53:54] <yomamma133713> "born with"
[0:53:56] <picanoturna> it's a part of you
[0:53:57] <%livlinn> ye...
[0:53:58] <andre11dr> 3 is pretty sad ,especially when your doing the do all the drugs/alchohol run
[0:54:05] <%livlinn> addiction is a binch
[0:54:05] <glorioushedonist> an alcoholic before you've had alcohol...?
[0:54:07] <LlewynMarie> once an addict always an addict
[0:54:10] <picanoturna> the alcoholic gene
[0:54:11] <+RealThiele> electrochemistry just waiting to jump back in
[0:54:13] <iacus_> that doesn't sound like humans work
[0:54:14] <Dakuu75> some ppl are genetically more disposed toward addictions
[0:54:15] <Teyaric> Electrochemistry Never Shuts Up
[0:54:18] <%X2Eliah> you can kick addiction, you cannot kick the susceptibility to addiction
[0:54:19] <+FlubbedPig> I don't think you NEED predisposition to addiction to form addictions.
[0:54:21] <%MrAtheGreat> I wouldn’t say you are just ‘born’ with it. Not always, I’d like to think
[0:54:23] <pi_in_the_sci> Yeah, addiction is sort of a genetic condition
[0:54:26] <+mechslayer71> @glorioushedonist I guess he means the tendency/predilection
[0:54:31] <Johannen> We are talking alchoholism not addiction people
[0:54:34] <+eanscrale> Yeah there's gamblers in my family, and some of them never learned.
[0:54:35] <+Undenizen> you can never level down electrochemistry
[0:54:38] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> facts
[0:54:39] <glorioushedonist> yeah, like addictive personality types
[0:54:43] <Chatterbox1991> Think about the amount of addicts who become devoutly religious for example
[0:54:45] <zanzibarian_hamster> The siren call of escapism never really goes away
[0:54:46] <skyenoz> if not alcohol then something else
[0:54:48] <Equirah> @glorioushedonist it's a symptom not a cause
[0:54:57] <MinersLoveGames> Maybe being born with it is a bit of a stretch, but addictive personalities is another story.
[0:55:03] <+MightyDuckShoes> it's just a Christ mill
[0:55:07] <aiutare47> AA is shitty org
[0:55:11] <%smyld> Sigh was just talk about this with a friend of mine
[0:55:11] <+RealThiele> replace booze with jesus
[0:55:12] <+eanscrale> the soos, they always want you to drink the soos joos
[0:55:14] <GarbageNirvana> They really want you in on that higher power
[0:55:23] <iacus_> addictive personalities are for sure a thing, but you can bend your personality with work
[0:55:25] <Blackleafx> There's coffee and biscuits in the back
[0:55:30] <picanoturna> accept jesus and you're fine
[0:55:36] <%livlinn> the slip NotLikeThis
[0:55:36] <glorioushedonist> God is probably super drunk all the time
[0:55:38] <+MightyDuckShoes> addicts make for good zealots
[0:55:47] <Dakuu75> it's a permanent debuff
[0:55:48] <nakunattakage> The awareness helps you fight it though
[0:55:51] <+Jeshk0> the struggle never ends
[0:55:53] <MinersLoveGames> Some people are more suseptible to addiction.
[0:55:56] <%servicesuspension> it's better in the long run, there's the power of the struggler
[0:55:57] <Equirah> @iacus_ you don't realise what you're saying
[0:56:00] <RushUnplugged> AA has the same success rate (IE not great) as any other recover program, so might as well go with the non-preachy ones
[0:56:02] <Chatterbox1991> Personal Growth is a pain in the ass even if it's good in the long run
[0:56:05] <DSD24> Man Harry is zoning out right now
[0:56:12] <JetpackMcQuack> It’s a battle
[0:56:13] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:56:15] <%MrAtheGreat> Religion can be just as addictive and destructive as drugs and booze. Gotta realize what a vice is and how you handle it.
[0:56:17] <iacus_> @iacus_ yes I do
[0:56:18] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> They literally tell you to replace God in all the literature with Good OrDinal thinking
[0:56:20] <aiutare47> AA is not quite a scam but its evangelical as hell and doesn't really help much beyond faith. It works for some but not for a lot of people.
[0:56:24] <glorioushedonist> Look at Bart Gets an F. sometimes hard work can't do shit
[0:56:25] <%cobalt_phoenix_> wait aa is a church thing?
[0:56:25] <MinersLoveGames> First step to fixing a problem is acknowledging there is one.
[0:56:34] <aiutare47> @cobalt_phoenix_ big time
[0:56:37] <LlewynMarie> they need to stop treating addiction like a failing of someones character and trying to treat it with spiritually and start treating it as the mental and medical condition that it is
[0:56:40] <%servicesuspension> replace vices with slightly better vices until you kinda function
[0:56:41] <%CappuccinoGuil> @cobalt_phoenix_ a lot of AA meetings are done in churchs
[0:56:46] <+eanscrale> "one drink can't hurt, right?"
[0:56:47] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @cobalt_phoenix_ oh wow never knew that
[0:56:49] <%MrAtheGreat> Battle never ends
[0:56:50] <%thetunnelhomer> @cobalt_phoenix_ BIG time
[0:57:04] <picanoturna> we will meet the crab man

[0:57:34] <%purps26> I love that you are the biggest disaster of a human being ever and Kim just keep saying he's seen worse
[0:57:50] <Blackleafx> @purps26 He absolutely has
[0:58:01] <Johannen> Harrier is a highly functioning chem factory
[0:58:05] <mr_sups> I love the name "Jamrock" for a city
[0:58:12] <iacus_> There's much worse than Harry for sure
[0:58:20] <iacus_> even in Martinaise itself
[0:58:23] <Blackleafx> @purps26 Harry is a disaster, but he's a disaster with some moral values. Kim mentions that a LOT of the police he's seen just abuse their power for profit or machismo
[0:58:27] <DSD24> "Things are gonna get a whole lot worse before it gets any better"
[0:58:32] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @mr_sups It has soul
[0:58:33] <LlewynMarie> wow
[0:58:33] <DatAsuna> legend of korra "greatest change" shit too
[0:58:34] <+mechslayer71> Harry is still functioning, so he’s not at the bottom
[0:58:36] <twohitgood> the thing about addiction is that it's a slow creeping thing and the better you are at your vice and living with it, the more you'll fall into that as an addiction. high functioning drunk makes for a worse addict. because the problem doesn't become a "problem".
[0:58:38] <picanoturna> it is what it is
[0:58:40] <%servicesuspension> 4 months ago, with a picture from 10 years ago
[0:58:45] <+Undenizen> hey man, no matter how bad it gets, your only options are "get better" or "die"
[0:58:48] <Blackleafx> """fine"""
[0:58:50] <+Sir_Louis> "managing"
[0:58:51] <spaceitaly> no matter how bad things may seem, you are still alive, you still have a future
[0:58:52] <Blackleafx> Functional
[0:58:57] <aiutare47> you were not sliding as hard
[0:58:57] <picanoturna> alive
[0:59:08] <glorioushedonist> shit fell apart fast
[0:59:12] <Chatterbox1991> speaking as someone who has had to reinvent himself a lot, personal growth is an overall good thing, even if existentially draining on a deeply psychological and emotional level. @WoolieVersus
[0:59:14] <%heysamuel> winter depression making things worse
[0:59:15] <%CappuccinoGuil> 4 months is a lot of time to drink a lot of Al Gul

[0:59:50] <aiutare47> hey chat really specific question but when do we hear about how the clipboard/ledger gets damaged?
[0:59:50] <MinersLoveGames> I'm going through a lot of re-structuring as well. Going away to a camp in a couple weeks that teaches basic life skills, as a matter of fact.

[1:00:12] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> cop crunch jesus
[1:00:14] <Blackleafx> @aiutare47 its the "Unsolvable Case"
[1:00:15] <%servicesuspension> yeah, cop crunch, and you can't not cop crunch because you might start to ... remember
[1:00:24] <Robot_Nixon_> twice
[1:00:39] <aiutare47> have we? Its a really important detail to Harry's story but I dont remember Woolie mentioning it
[1:00:44] <%servicesuspension> the RCM is a militia though, and absurdly underfunded
[1:00:45] <%MrAtheGreat> @WoolieVersus Remember the Blue Shivers moment? The dead kid and the dead mom, and that wasn't the first murder that day? Jamrock suuuuuucks
[1:00:50] <glorioushedonist> So a Generation of non-cop Harry's are on the way IRL
[1:00:53] <DSD24> McCoy sounds familiar
[1:01:02] <ARToo_Am_Me> Blursed
[1:01:16] <zanzibarian_hamster> Isn't jamrock essentioally third world?
[1:01:25] <Blackleafx> @zanzibarian_hamster its a slum
[1:01:26] <Chatterbox1991> @WoolieVersus out of curiosity, what is the most crime ridden neighborhood in Montreal? does it compare to Jamrock?
[1:01:26] <ToxInjection> that's a fuckIng last name, God damn
[1:01:35] <aiutare47> Jamrock is Detroit
[1:01:37] <Johannen> @zanzibarian_hamster Previous first world after war
[1:01:37] <2deep5u> those are almost all real philosophers

[1:02:27] <ronin19xx> 5 On good cop bad cop
[1:02:31] <+Reverend_Roscoe> Is Kim Harrys Sam Seder?

[1:05:14] <jorniev> THAT FOX NEWS GUY THOUGH
[1:05:14] <%Juriasu> LUL
[1:05:17] <glorioushedonist> but the tie talks...
[1:05:18] <+Undenizen> A Bow Tie *on Harry*, Woolie.
[1:05:18] <Blackleafx> i like em :c
[1:05:21] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[1:05:22] <%hax_metatron> Like that Curb episode
[1:05:23] <drunken_lemur> I know what Woolie means
[1:05:23] <%Afterman_> god i love brother mouzone
[1:05:27] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> lol you gotta be a specific kinda person to pull it off
[1:05:28] <Chatterbox1991> Louis Farrakhan
[1:05:29] <twohitgood> 11th doctor pulled off a bow tie.
[1:05:30] <elshadow7> The Tucker Carlson style
[1:05:31] <iacus_> oh lol brother mouzone
[1:05:33] <%SignScratch> "Hey, young Brotha. lemme talk to you"
[1:05:35] <%CappuccinoGuil> Bow tie is make or break. It looks horrible most times, but when it works, it WORKS
[1:05:38] <Deasmeister> To quote the Doctor bowties are cool
[1:05:38] <andre11dr> Unless you're Rugal you ain't pulling it off
[1:05:38] <DatAsuna> I learned how to tie them specifically for cosplay lol
[1:05:42] <picanoturna> minister farrakhan lookin ass
[1:05:44] <%wolfofsound> @WoolieVersus what about a bolo tie? LUL
[1:05:46] <%Afterman_> the muslim brotherhood style is cool af cant lie
[1:05:46] <%X2Eliah> LUL Tucker Carlson
[1:05:48] <dukenux> it's more like "Old timey libertartian" to me, but you can pull it off
[1:05:49] <+Undenizen> you can do it if you're Bill Nye
[1:05:53] <Dakuu75> Bow ties make me think of Dr. Who and Carlton
[1:05:53] <ink_dino> you have to be the least bow knot person possible to make the bow knot work
[1:05:54] <%servicesuspension> Is there really such thing as pulling off a bow tie
[1:06:01] <%MrAtheGreat> Pee-wee Herman is drip as fuck
[1:06:02] <andre11dr> Or Majima for that matter
[1:06:02] <+QueequegTheater> You really don't want to model yourself after Louis Farrakhan OR Tucker Carlson tbh
[1:06:05] <glorioushedonist> you gotta be in a full suit
[1:06:05] <DatAsuna> It took practice
[1:06:11] <+QueequegTheater> Bill Nye tho
[1:06:19] <twohitgood> I can do a few knots for neckties but no clue for bowties
[1:06:23] <Johannen> Bolo ties are pretenders and not even a tie
[1:06:24] <ingman112> The only way to “pull off” a bowtie is to rip its carcass off your body
[1:06:24] <+ReallyBigRocks> Bill Nye's story about learning to tie a bow tie is really fascinating
[1:06:34] <dukenux> i wear a tie so rarely i have to remind myself how to tie it
[1:06:35] <Indigo_Automaton> Fuck ties. I wish cloaks and robes were mainstream
[1:06:35] <picanoturna> girls dont like bow ties bro
[1:06:37] <Dakuu75> YEAH lol
[1:06:39] <DatAsuna> Tying a bowtie is easy all except for the one step at the end
[1:06:46] <%CappuccinoGuil> That tie will be INVALUABLE later
[1:06:51] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @indigo_automaton no capes!
[1:06:55] <%MrAtheGreat> not bad either
[1:06:55] <%heysamuel> when i was in drama school i wore bow ties to professional events so this is just a kick in the dick
[1:07:01] <+Joe2187> gonna see woolie slinging bean pies on the corner
[1:07:02] <+RealThiele> good ol' necktie
[1:07:17] <elshadow7> "Wearing this bowtie will make yo want to *just asking some questions*"
[1:07:17] <glorioushedonist> you can take off the bag it's fine
[1:07:19] <Dakuu75> that's a beat-down flashlight, god-damn
[1:07:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> why am I just sitting in your pocket Bratan

[1:07:38] <%MrAtheGreat> It did in the Doom Commercial area
[1:07:40] <%Juriasu> it would if it was dark
[1:07:40] <heemwizard> it does that a few times
[1:07:41] <%CappuccinoGuil> @krispen_wa the bowtie, I mean
[1:07:41] <picanoturna> it did
[1:07:43] <+charp35> Shouldn't he put the horrific neck tie back on?
[1:07:43] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @indigo_automaton not yet
[1:07:45] <glorioushedonist> you can't even go through the commercial area without it
[1:07:45] <ronin19xx> It did
[1:07:49] <+ReallyBigRocks> I think it's only really in the commercial area
[1:08:00] <ingman112> The game will let you know, generally

[1:58:17] <Space_Pagan> IDIOT DOOM SPIRAL
[1:58:18] <%Afterman_> this man got jokered
[1:58:19] <Electro96> long story very short
[1:58:19] <heemwizard> idiotic doom spiraling down
[1:58:20] <3rdRunner> THE JOKER
[1:58:20] <%cobalt_phoenix_> wait wait how did he go from locked out to homeless???
[1:58:21] <+NoHopeForMyCuirass> I love how we've all had a bad day like this, but DIDN'T become the Joker
[1:58:21] <+DenpaDev> That's quite a jump
[1:58:21] <%CappuccinoGuil> CALL A LOCKSMITH
[1:58:22] <+Undenizen> that seems.... extreme.

[1:58:27] <iacus_> that is definitely an idiot doom spiral
[1:58:27] <Ecall10528> IDIOT DOOM SPIRAL
[1:58:28] <%AmuserName> LOST KEYS = jphYADUN
[1:58:29] <Lefteron> why didnt you call a locksmithe you dolt?
[1:58:30] <BourneWarrior> YOU COULDN'T GET A LOCKSMITH?
[1:58:32] <%Afterman_> he definitely lived in a society
[1:58:33] <MinersLoveGames> CALL A LOCKSMITH.
[1:58:33] <picanoturna> not but the hand of the market
[1:58:38] <+airchrysalis> I don't understand this character, what he is supposed to convey
[1:58:40] <%servicesuspension> this is such a realistic mental episode though, it manifests as slow disorientation and then just... spirals
[1:58:43] <%Gruhunchously> @Reverend_Roscoe Welcome to Revachol
[1:58:43] <linSP> He became the jokar
[1:58:43] <drunken_lemur> yada yada yada
[1:58:44] <feralspidey> literally could have just called the landlord, or left a spare key under the doormate
[1:58:49] <Inqy833> Get the feeling he skipped a few steps
[1:58:52] <MinersLoveGames> BRUH, JUST CALL A LOCKSMITH.
[1:58:55] <%alpharius88> woolieDATTEBAYO
[1:58:56] <+BubbaRands> There's are indeed steps missing here
[1:58:56] <ingman112> We went from Point A to point B to point 26
[1:58:57] <+ReallyBigRocks> uh huh
[1:58:58] <BlackermanZX> bruh just call the landlord or sumthin
[1:59:03] <Robot_Nixon_> I feel like there were things you could do
[1:59:04] <dukenux> you couldn't call a locksmith?
[1:59:04] <elshadow7> -Who are you and how did you get in here? -I'm a locksmith, and, I'm a locksmith.
[1:59:09] <picanoturna> just get another job
[1:59:10] <%hax_metatron> If you caught hints in his story you would already notice he was alcoholic and spiraling
[1:59:10] <MinersLoveGames> LANDLORD, LOCKSMITH, SPARE KEY.
[1:59:11] <Blackleafx> the CEO of bullshitting
[1:59:12] <twohitgood> uh.. you just lost keys and couldn't get more keys from anyone else?
[1:59:13] <%hax_metatron> The day is an excuse
[1:59:16] <feralspidey> literally just get help and pick yourself up.
[1:59:18] <+DrSmashy> HE'S COMPROMISED
[1:59:23] <Lefteron> @ingman112 to point Ω
[1:59:25] <%Vigonept> theres your answer
[1:59:29] <+choopercabra> This guys just making excuses basically
[1:59:36] <MinersLoveGames> Excuese.
[1:59:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> RCM can't even ask for your ID right?
[1:59:45] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:59:46] <nakunattakage> That's not how jail works in this world I thought limesO
[1:59:47] <%hax_metatron> Coping mechanism,
[1:59:50] <BlackermanZX> or he is super dumb
[1:59:51] <+BubbaRands> You could've at least CONTACTED A NEIGHBOR or something...
[1:59:55] <dukenux> he's not mentioning everything
[1:59:55] <+eanscrale> Something does seem like it went bust.
[1:59:58] <%X2Eliah> No he is just very high concept
[1:59:58] <picanoturna> this guy is bullshit
[2:00:00] <%servicesuspension> he needed to get away from all the HUSTLE
[2:00:08] <dukenux> you think? Kappa
[2:00:11] <%kewlmyc> So he's fucking lying
[2:00:14] <BourneWarrior> Ah so its Bullshit
[2:00:17] <%Gruhunchously> He's an ad man, it's in his blood
[2:00:26] <Indigo_Automaton> He may also be too drunk
[2:00:27] <+DrSmashy> He does have the expensive jogging suit though
[2:00:29] <nakunattakage> The grift is in his soul
[2:00:33] <LlewynMarie> sounds to me like the girlfriend might have changed the locks
[2:00:37] <picanoturna> maybe its psychological
[2:00:42] <%hax_metatron> If you were alcoholic maybe it just all blurred into one thing
[2:00:44] <BourneWarrior> Oh fuck off
[2:00:44] <DatAsuna> No actually
[2:00:46] <%cobalt_phoenix_> step 1. lose keys step 2. ??? step 3. no profit
[2:00:48] <MinersLoveGames> oh god
[2:00:51] <%Gruhunchously> Oh no
[2:00:56] <heemwizard> 22
[2:00:57] <DatAsuna> alternative facts
[2:00:59] <dukenux> why do i feel it wasn't one bottle
[2:01:03] <Lefteron> IN MY OPINION...!
[2:01:11] <MinersLoveGames> this kind of dude is why my dad hates homeless people.
[2:01:12] <%Gruhunchously> Glass houses, and all that
[2:01:18] <feralspidey> Step 1) locked outside apartment Step 2) ... Step 3) Homeless Step 4) Profit. Truly, he IS an artist.
[2:01:21] <LlewynMarie> yes
[2:01:22] <ingman112> FROM MY POINT OF—
[2:01:22] <%X2Eliah> plague of gripes answer
[2:01:23] <+eanscrale> This is why you can't trust advertising, it's just propaganda for the bourgeoisie.
[2:01:23] <+BubbaRands> Probably...
[2:01:26] <%servicesuspension> dude, something's clearly wrong with him, and not just morally
[2:01:33] <Blackleafx> Notice its also a different tracksuit from the one in the story
[2:01:34] <%kewlmyc> Premium LICKRA
[2:01:39] <Blackleafx> so hes def not telling the whole story
[2:01:40] <feralspidey> He sounds like a sidecharacter from rent.
[2:01:45] <Robot_Nixon_> Were his friends in the apartment too?
[2:01:45] <AngryAsian5> SOMEHOW
[2:01:50] <+Jeshk0> *somehow*
[2:01:51] <%hax_metatron> SOMEHOW
[2:01:54] <seniormeatbox> is this Garrus?
[2:01:55] <+BubbaRands> Why not contact one of those 20 FULL TIME employees?!
[2:01:57] <picanoturna> what happened to his ass
[2:02:02] <Space_Pagan> ...somehow
[2:02:03] <+ReallyBigRocks> @Blackleafx I think in the story he said the country it came from not the brand
[2:02:05] <MinersLoveGames> NO.
[2:02:14] <heemwizard> he's harry but even worse
[2:02:28] <picanoturna> he sounds sane
[2:02:32] <%servicesuspension> the functional one is always the one who repressed some SHIT
[2:02:36] <heemwizard> @picanoturna didnt wanna continue dating a homeless man
[2:02:41] <Robot_Nixon_> @BubbaRands they were also in his apartment
[2:02:44] <%SirGO0SE> they're compromised D:
[2:02:50] <Who_lio42> hes selling you his saneness
[2:02:57] <ingman112> Veneer is a great word for it
[2:03:00] <picanoturna> @heemwizard makes so much sense
[2:03:03] <DatAsuna> It is not Brandon Keener, no
[2:03:09] <linSP> Could he have contacted the locksmith or something
[2:03:11] <dukenux> i think the way he went down simply didn't feel his adamant worldview
[2:03:19] <%Rainbow_Ashes> Rainbow_Ashes subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[2:03:24] <dukenux> *fit
[2:03:26] <DatAsuna> the last game i heard garrus in was red dead 2 as random npcs
[2:03:35] <+BubbaRands> @Robot_Nixon_ Ahhh I see! And they all had their airpods in. They didn't hear him knock LUL
[2:03:35] <%servicesuspension> and then they say the magic words: "BLOCKCHAIN"
[2:03:40] <dukenux> there's a difference between a bum and a homeless person
[2:03:42] <feralspidey> Speaking as someone high functioning, albeit growing more well-rounded over the year, all it takes is a spiral for someone with large-scale conceptualization to start living in their own dramatic retelling of events/
[2:03:42] <Robot_Nixon_> Don't go outside you might lose your apartment
[2:03:45] <+Bitscreed> @DatAsuna I last heard him in XCOM 2
[2:03:47] <+DenpaDev> Spot the poor!

[2:04:11] <+Jeshk0> *very* high concept
[2:04:17] <dukenux> Ah yes, TITS - high concept advertising
[2:04:17] <+Bitscreed> @DatAsuna Yep!
[2:04:20] <%Irridium> oh god it's NFT's
[2:04:25] <picanoturna> oh man

[2:04:37] <Indigo_Automaton> VALUE
[2:04:37] <+eanscrale> He called it THIN AIR, it'slike poetry.
[2:04:38] <%servicesuspension> this is just the dotcom bubble. we got the ideas, we got the people, we got the value, we only need SOMETHING WE CAN SELL
[2:04:45] <+Jeshk0> literally selling Thin Air
[2:04:50] <ingman112> NFT - Nonexistent Fucking Trash
[2:05:03] <Blank9> if this world didn't have the idea of marketing tits with the color red before, that's pretty revolutionary
[2:05:06] <%SirGO0SE> I would buy a Woolie NFT just to be the one to have it
[2:05:10] <+DenpaDev> just look at elon musk
[2:05:13] <+mechslayer71> @dukenux no, that’s the low concept stuff he combined the high concept with. Aren’t you listening? Kappa

[2:05:40] <JetpackMcQuack> Value*
[2:05:42] <feralspidey> this is giving me flashbacks to sales/marketing course in college... you can just be an entrepreneur by just telling people how to be an entrepreneur.
[2:05:44] <Prevot> wait THIS is free and ad supported
[2:05:53] <iacus_> the thing is that the Internet flipped the economy of information
[2:05:54] <Brandon__Brando> jokes on them I have ad block!
[2:06:23] <+NoHopeForMyCuirass> Shoutout to Karl Marx for envisioning a machine that generated value with no labor before information economy came forward
[2:06:25] <+BubbaRands> This capitalism take has be brought to you by RAID SHADOW LEGENDS
[2:06:30] <%servicesuspension> ZA/UM is a universal poetic language

[2:50:29] <Dakuu75> I do miss the drive forms from 2. that shit was the best
[2:50:31] <+askalta> I waited my entire life for kh3 and it was just remade in the engine movies
[2:51:04] <andre11dr> That guitar loop is so nice
[2:51:20] <kikoeru_san> 3 has the WORST pacing I've seen in a piece of media for a while
[2:51:22] <%CappuccinoGuil> BOP BOP BOP BOP
[2:51:37] <insertdisc5> 3 is one of the few games that made me throw my controller accross the room
[2:51:43] <%krispen_wa> 90% of kh3 can be removed and nothing would change
[2:51:48] <%servicesuspension> is Kingdom Hearts about anything anymore

[3:07:33] <%krispen_wa> THIS IS BORING, BRATAN
[3:07:34] <ingman112> Chat of One Guys
[3:07:37] <SomeAsianDood> no point tie isn't alive
[3:07:40] <+caramelatte1> Ah this is the boring route then lol
[3:07:41] <Ids560> Electro has some fun stuff to say about that one
[3:07:42] <Blackleafx> GUYS, He will not be able to do anything with it in this playthrough
[3:07:43] <Indigo_Automaton> Pilsner for more stories
[3:07:43] <picanoturna> its useless without the tie sell it
[3:07:44] <%Vigonept> he doesnt have the tie on
[3:07:49] <Zomner> chat's own Volition is too low
[3:07:51] <Space_Pagan> No point if Tie is dead to keep it
[3:07:56] <jorniev> HE can do what it wants, but he can also do content
[3:07:59] <%hax_metatron> KEEP IT Don't lose the spirits
[3:07:59] <+airchrysalis> dead tie is sad
[3:08:00] <Blackleafx> @Vigonept thats not the issue, he never acivated it to begin with
[3:08:01] <Dakuu75> Volition is literally "I can't kill myself... it'd make my mum MEGA-sad."
[3:08:02] <skyenoz> Volition: BTW do NOT kill yourself by drinking formaldehyde
[3:08:03] <+dalmek> chat, since the thing isn't active, selling is basically the only option
[3:08:04] <notadeasterisk> fuc*** volittion, but this harry doens' have enough imagination
[3:08:06] <Blackleafx> @hax_metatron he CANT use it
[3:08:07] <Strigiform> woolie doesnt have the stats for the other option, for this build its just money
[3:08:08] <ulcaban> Volition's been keeping Harry alive for awhile
[3:08:08] <ingman112> Chat is just "I SAW THE THING SAY THE THING SAY IT" without any critical thinking
[3:08:09] <buffcat> if the tie doesnt speak up about the alcohol will it do it if you wear it later?
[3:08:14] <%krispen_wa> I hate that the Tie only exists if you pass ONE check at the very beginning
[3:08:18] <Blackleafx> thank you ingman
[3:08:32] <+dalmek> @buffcat if it never speaks up at the beginning, it never speaks at all
[3:08:32] <SomeAsianDood> @buffcat nope u need to pass the initial check

[3:19:00] <sahr_zand> There is no playing the game wrong!
[3:19:00] <Ids560> nah it's just a different way to play
[3:19:02] <%servicesuspension> no wrongplay
[3:19:03] <Ecall10528> Incorrect.
[3:19:04] <%X2Eliah> big incorrect
[3:19:04] <+caramelatte1> wrong
[3:19:04] <iacus_> there is no way to play the game wrong (except going communist)
[3:19:04] <%Arnoldoaad1> You are wrong
[3:19:04] <DSD24> I went sober it was good
[3:19:05] <%TheFabledAble> no woolie its not wrong
[3:19:06] <nelsonsaysbooya> All paths are valid
[3:19:06] <+KillerCrocomire> There is no wrongplay
[3:19:08] <%Gruhunchously> This is incorrect
[3:19:08] <%krispen_wa> The FREQUENCY IS A TRAP
[3:19:09] <Klarrann3> it's not at all
[3:19:11] <%BallerSwagBro9k> There is no wrong way to play this game
[3:19:11] <%Double_Tap_That> Sober is a legit playstyle.
[3:19:12] <%cobalt_phoenix_> no you can absolutely play sober don't listen to the woolieONEGUY
[3:19:13] <Caveengi> I played sober and I loved it
[3:19:14] <%X2Eliah> wrong
[3:19:14] <jorniev> there is no incorrect way to PLAY the game
[3:19:14] <%Vigonept> every choice is fin3
[3:19:15] <pepinillomaton> drugs bad. yucky yuck
[3:19:16] <Johannen> No wrong way to play the game
[3:19:16] <insertdisc5> the only wrongplay is to not play
[3:19:18] <penitentpendant> There are rewards for going full cold turkey, there are rewards for boozing up. Both have forms of content.
[3:19:21] <Inqy833> Don’t give in
[3:19:23] <nelsonsaysbooya> All paths are valid.
[3:19:25] <dmtjinni> dont be pussy
[3:19:25] <andre11dr> You do get stuff for going cold turkey
[3:19:25] <%Vigonept> the only bad choice is racism
[3:19:27] <ingman112> If it seems like a crutch it's because it is designed to be one. If you want to play a sober Harry, play a sober Harry
[3:19:28] <+mads_valentine> Woolie, stop worrying about playing the game wrong. It just makes you play the game wrong.
[3:19:32] <Space_Pagan> No wrong way to play this game.
[3:19:34] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Trace_Bovier
[3:19:35] <%krispen_wa> REJECT AL GHUL. RETURN TO SOBRIETY
[3:19:36] <+MightyDuckShoes> The Entire Universe says No
[3:19:40] <teefpal> There's no wrong way to play the game
[3:19:41] <+eanscrale> It will effect the ending, but it's still a valid ending, and you can still solve the case
[3:19:43] <JetpackMcQuack> For Kim
[3:19:47] <%Gruhunchously> Al gul is love, Al gul is life
[3:19:49] <+meniscate> big overthink
[3:19:53] <nelsonsaysbooya> There is no wrong way to play Disco Elysium
[3:19:57] <andre11dr> However doing drugs is fun, but it won't end good for you
[3:20:01] <picanoturna> play it straight for kim. your half brothers.
[3:20:05] <heemwizard> kim is fine with drugs
[3:20:12] <%heysamuel> there's no wrong way to play, unless you're pissing off kim, in which case you're playing it wrong
[3:20:14] <%cobalt_phoenix_> you'll be fiiiiiine
[3:20:15] <dmtjinni> BIG BIG BIG OVERTHINK
[3:20:19] <available_line> d o . i t . f o r . h i m
[3:20:23] <+meniscate> Ahem, there is a WRONG way to play. It's called no necktie
[3:20:27] <Indigo_Automaton> 1
[3:20:29] <teefpal> It's there for the stat checks you NEED to make
[3:20:31] <+MightyDuckShoes> Drugs is literally the easy the way out. Struggle on, Struggler
[3:20:33] <Inqy833> Do it for *the people*
[3:20:35] <Blank9> there's totally wrong ways to play the game, you just have to try to do it bad
[3:20:41] <%krispen_wa> Woolie Versus Overthinking: Part XXIII
[3:20:42] <picanoturna> do it for the working class
[3:20:47] <teefpal> Yeah going no necktie really doesn't pay off
[3:20:51] <andre11dr> My first playthrough i did EVERY drug and yeah, it got pretty sad by the end
[3:20:53] <+eanscrale> You can actually get a ton of experience if you have the right ideas internalized
[3:20:54] <+airchrysalis> he is not overthinking it
[3:21:06] <penitentpendant> That 4
[3:21:15] <ingman112> This is one of the few times Woolie is actually NOT overthinking it
[3:21:18] <+ReallyBigRocks> @teefpal That's different than sober playthrough
[3:21:27] <insertdisc5> and youre so handsome and pretty etc
[3:21:29] <%krispen_wa> Sorry Cop
[3:21:30] <picanoturna> theres no wrong way to play the game but there IS a right way
[3:21:41] <dmtjinni> @airchrysalis it is one line by the end of the game. BIG overthinking it
[3:21:54] <Dogking16> @picanoturna Agreed
[3:21:56] <%krispen_wa> The only wrong way to play is not doing as many quests as you can
[3:22:01] <+eanscrale> Just because you're right, doesn't mean you're correct
[3:22:01] <%cobalt_phoenix_> said no cop ever

[3:23:18] <+elhafnero> clothes do not unlock the check
[3:23:20] <+ReallyBigRocks> he's not wearing any -Logic clothes
[3:23:22] <%cobalt_phoenix_> no that won't unlock
[3:23:22] <nakunattakage> clothes don't reset checks
[3:23:24] <Burningfajitas> You only unlock a white check by LEVELING UP the skill.
[3:23:24] <ingman112> Clothes alone are not enough to unlock the check
[3:23:25] <%Irridium> gotta level up for it to reset
[3:23:26] <+airchrysalis> clothes dont work like that
[3:23:26] <%CappuccinoGuil> Put clothes, try it, if fail, level up
[3:23:27] <Deasmeister> That doent work
[3:23:28] <+caramelatte1> You have to use SKILL POINTS to retry
[3:23:29] <andre11dr> That's not how it works
[3:23:29] <%bread_assassin> Clothes don't do that.
[3:23:30] <resloxxx> Clothes do not unlock checks
[3:23:30] <ChamoCamouflage> no

[3:23:47] <+mechslayer71> How do they still not understand these mechanics
[3:23:48] <skyenoz> but what about stat penalties due to thoughts?
[3:23:50] <Strigiform> o its the thought
[3:23:52] <Davimotion96> Clothes don't reset
[3:23:54] <%CappuccinoGuil> Your thoughts?
[3:23:56] <ChamoCamouflage> Thoughts
[3:23:58] <Trace_Bovier> pause thought
[3:24:00] <penitentpendant> The negatives are coming from thoughts, not clothing, but you should have Logic gaining clothes at this point
[3:24:04] <pi_in_the_sci> It's being affected by you thoughts
[3:24:05] <picanoturna> it's the thoughts
[3:24:06] <Klarrann3> pause thoughts
[3:24:09] <%CappuccinoGuil> You have 3 logic with 5 int, you SHOULD have 5 logic

[3:49:51] <BourneWarrior> @skyenoz Couldn't or Shouldn't
[3:49:52] <%SignScratch> cocaine can be injected, and was considered medicine
[3:49:56] <+Bitscreed> HONEST
[3:49:56] <justcallmebobplease> THINGS DON'T GO IN YOUR FLESH - but injections are normalized via medicine. Why can't this setting have normalized snorting?

[4:01:50] <%wolfofsound> that sounds like food to drive you insane
[4:01:59] <+caramelatte1> Though anything can be something if you try hard enough.

[4:02:49] <+Jeshk0> the kid in front of the bookstore is a good one at least
[4:03:04] <dukenux> like a year
[4:03:08] <ingman112> Disco's kids are the best kids
[4:03:12] <ingman112> They all deserve to be protected

[4:39:01] <Ecall10528> Bye everyone, was fun!
[4:39:06] <%cobalt_phoenix_> this game is DENSE
[4:39:13] <WeepyDevil> american libertarian are all for the state monoply of violence, cause armies are bassically corporatiosn if you squint ahrd enough
[4:39:16] <%livlinn> forgottenLiger forgottenLiger forgottenLiger
[4:39:17] <%Gruhunchously> Next time, Liliene and The Church
[4:39:23] <andre11dr> Today was not as insane but still pretty fun
[4:39:23] <%cobalt_phoenix_> that's the point
[4:39:26] <WeepyDevil> as are cops
[4:39:28] <picanoturna> no progress but that's fine
[4:39:30] <penitentpendant> Unfortunately, the only 'sane' option is 'Boring Cop'
[4:39:38] <Johannen> Time for the Boring Cop is upon us
[4:39:40] <+mechslayer71> We walked 400 feet today :)
[4:39:40] <Darkdrill> woolie what are you???
[4:39:41] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> I think that's the point @woolieversus
[4:39:43] <SomeAsianDood> That's the point. They're all awful, one of them is less awful to you
[4:39:44] <derap41> Boring cop can be fun at time
[4:39:45] <WeepyDevil> i mean thats kind of like real life, lol
[4:39:48] <%baka_sugoi> wait is woolz playing as a centralist?

[4:40:04] <Darkdrill> LUL
[4:40:06] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> which of one of these shitty viewpoints do I hate the least
[4:40:07] <derap41> a mysterious forth thing
[4:40:07] <teefpal> an anarkiddie?
[4:40:07] <andre11dr> But Woolie what about THE HUSTLE
[4:40:09] <DatAsuna> Woolie admitting he doesn't exist?
[4:40:10] <Ecall10528> Woolie is a moralist.
[4:40:12] <heartlesshealer> woolie is a Woolie
[4:40:12] <derap41> Its not reality its Harry's views
[4:40:15] <Zomner> ah, so you are the Boring Cop Kappa
[4:40:23] <%cobalt_phoenix_> no but woolie you gotta fit into these corners tho
[4:40:23] <WeepyDevil> @teefpal well, liebrtarian means soemthing very differently in (north) america than it does in most other places around the world
[4:40:25] <lotharrio> Woolie is a Neo-Retro Blipster.
[4:40:25] <SomeAsianDood> So your a moralist like the Sunday friend Kappa
[4:40:30] <Chatterbox1991> i think Social Liberal tends to neatly apply to most people in an inoffensive way
[4:40:30] <iacus_> no nuances! go to the extremes or nothing!!!
[4:40:31] <Johannen> Woolie you are the moralist, just admit you dont want to asociate with Sunday Friend
[4:40:34] <DatAsuna> "I'm a millennial, so I hate labels"
[4:40:38] <penitentpendant> Praise the Boring Cop!
[4:40:43] <derap41> Librur
[4:40:45] <%baka_sugoi> Centralist LUL
[4:40:46] <%purps26> THE SUNDAY FRIEND
[4:40:47] <%heysamuel> the "please just fucking care about other people" box
[4:40:47] <teefpal> Libleft
[4:40:48] <Ids560> So anarchist?
[4:40:52] <Darkdrill> i just want to know if your on MY TEAM LUL
[4:40:53] <iacus_> go to the extremes or fuck off, one might say
[4:40:53] <+airchrysalis> bottom left is moralist
[4:40:54] <romc215> Woolie is everything and nothing at the same time, the underlying echo of creation whispering into the ear of the world, guiding it ever so slowly towards the abyss
[4:41:00] <SpaceLTN> moralist is centre
[4:41:02] <seriousink> this game also does push all the compass points to the extremes - sometimes for satire, sometimes to make a point.
[4:41:03] <derap41> Pretty sure you're just "left"
[4:41:04] <357Sneak> |_|
[4:41:05] <+Jeshk0> yeah more or less moralist
[4:41:14] <andre11dr> So anarchism PogChamp
[4:41:20] <+airchrysalis> boring is center
[4:41:25] <WeepyDevil> ah yes, the proofs for conservatism and authoritariansim, coming any day soon, lol
[4:41:26] <%krispen_wa> "I have no strong feelings one way or another" - Woolie
[4:41:30] <teefpal> Commies would just call you a 'social fascist'
[4:41:35] <%Gruhunchously> Case by Case basis! Nah, you need to subscribe to an all-encompassing ideology that dictates your view on every issue ever
[4:41:39] <Darkdrill> very understandable take it case by case
[4:41:54] <WeepyDevil> saying "i'm willing to be convinced" is always pretty silly, although i guess some limits are implied
[4:41:55] <Davimotion96> As much as the game makes fun of centrists, remember, Kim is a centrist and he is presented as pretty much the best person in the game, there's always nuance
[4:41:57] <iacus_> keep in mind this game has a very warped, 1st year of poslci, american podcast representation of "centrism"
[4:41:59] <teefpal> This is how people act; thoughtless ideological automotons
[4:42:03] <dukenux> @WoolieVersus but Woolie, the most important part: are you pro, or anti Skub?
[4:42:12] <andre11dr> Well the past has shown that chat i pro Comunism
[4:42:20] <plushysceptile> Did they finish the game?
[4:42:20] <teefpal> Push for the Devil Games!
[4:42:27] <SomeAsianDood> not even close @plushysceptile
[4:42:33] <andre11dr> @plushysceptile HELL NAH
[4:42:35] <DatAsuna> "But this is how we've always done things"
[4:42:39] <Ids560> @plushysceptile They're halfway through day 3
[4:42:48] <Scamsy> i think that's most people though. people identify with labels but still live with case by case basis and can be good faith
[4:42:53] <plushysceptile> Okay. Kind of sounds like the end of game breakdown but wasn't sure
[4:42:54] <doctorbeedrill> sweet lord
[4:43:01] <WeepyDevil> all of the games depiction of political ideologies except facism is pretty comedically exaggerated, and even then...
[4:43:01] <Lefteron> @plushysceptile not even close
[4:43:07] <+ReallyBigRocks> Live and let live in a no tolerance for intolerance way
[4:43:15] <teefpal> No, they are a long way from the end
[4:43:15] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:43:18] <heartlesshealer> this is just the Disco stream end break down. Happens every episode
[4:43:22] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> no tolerance for intolerance
[4:43:24] <Darkdrill> com on everything can fail
[4:43:25] <DatAsuna> Having a guy you can say is in charge is failing at step 1
[4:43:30] <Chatterbox1991> Josif Tito in Yugoslavia is as close as you are gonna get
[4:43:31] <mr_sups> Real Breakfast has not been tried
[4:43:39] <+mechslayer71> Convenient
[4:43:41] <WeepyDevil> little worker co-ops, yeah
[4:43:50] <%krispen_wa> Idealogy is dumb. Give us the AI overlord who knows whats best for us. as dictated by me.
[4:43:50] <Scamsy> What about anarchist societies that achieved collectivized towns?
[4:43:54] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> worker co-op yeah boiiii
[4:43:55] <Darkdrill> i just think that a mix system is the best thing
[4:43:57] <GarbageNirvana> No one system is going to be perfect because they're imagined by humans, and humans are naturally fallible
[4:43:57] <%DiscoMatador> We need to know your skubStance Woolz
[4:44:00] <teefpal> Tito's "market socialism" is basically just take IMF loans to keep the economy running
[4:44:03] <DatAsuna> But yeah it works better on a small scale, communes exist, but they only stably exists at the scale where everyone involved knows and sees each other
[4:44:05] <dukenux> more like the implementation of socialist policeis, which were brushed aside as "communism", so some people just went it, cause fuck it, why not at this point.
[4:44:05] <teefpal> *was
[4:44:09] <SonofMelonHead> So long as there's no central authoritarian party
[4:44:09] <%bread_assassin> "well, this wasn't REAL communism" says man starving to death.
[4:44:15] <Darkdrill> Socialist is the great in between
[4:44:23] <%livlinn> Just don’t be "illiberal" woolieDATTEBAYO
[4:44:30] <andre11dr> So time for anarchism
[4:44:31] <WeepyDevil> the spanish anarchists were doing pretty well, till they foolishly worked with the centrists, who very predictably backstabbed them
[4:44:31] <teefpal> People starve to death in liberal countries all the time
[4:44:44] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> socialism is necessary to transition to the next stage of the state from capitalism to something better
[4:44:50] <teefpal> Communism stopped the cycle of famine in Russia, China, etc
[4:44:51] <+ReallyBigRocks> once you get to a scale where people can disappear the idea of a commune starts to fall apart a bit
[4:44:54] <dukenux> "I litteraly just hate liberals. I don't have any other politics"
[4:44:54] <Scamsy> @weepydevil they had no choice and the soviet union backed the centrists
[4:44:57] <%krispen_wa> just give us the Borg
[4:45:09] <seriousink> there's also tons of different versions of communism - are any of them "true" communism? probably not. there probably isn't one. the game does actually touch on that if you go looking for it
[4:45:12] <MinersLoveGames> Communism is one of those things that's great on paper, but cannot be implemented IRL properly.
[4:45:12] <%livlinn> anti-establishment!! PogChamp
[4:45:19] <doctorbeedrill> potemkin deep thinking (society society SingsNote )
[4:45:33] <Johannen> @teefpal You meant to say started it? Cause it totaly fucked up agriculture for quite a hwile
[4:45:39] <%krispen_wa> WOOLIE HATES THE PROLETARIAT
[4:45:42] <Robot_Nixon_> its mostly memes
[4:45:48] <teefpal> Look at the death tolls pre communism
[4:45:53] <derap41> Dataism and technocracy is my Jam
[4:45:54] <Robot_Nixon_> well it should be mostly memes
[4:45:56] <%krispen_wa> WOOLIE IS A BOURGEOIS PUPPET
[4:45:57] <mr_sups> "Kill everyone with more that 25 Real in there Pocket"
[4:45:58] <heartlesshealer> it's just a buzzword now
[4:45:59] <WeepyDevil> i mean the reason to go one of the rotues in disco is for the vision quest
[4:46:02] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @minerslovegames only because communists always end up infighting and creating a new power dynamic and class system
[4:46:02] <Darkdrill> but what if it rules LUL ( it will not but what if )
[4:46:09] <andre11dr> We that's why THE HUSTLE is there
[4:46:09] <DatAsuna> Having a centralised form of control is failing at step 1 again
[4:46:12] <%livlinn> Problem is, everything corrupts PrideShrug
[4:46:14] <teefpal> Imagine GLF famine every few years, that was China for almost a century
[4:46:20] <Ids560> I mean if you're just going for Content, any of the choices is fine
[4:46:31] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> because we have bad actors everywhere?
[4:46:36] <penitentpendant> The most important thing: Protect Kim at all cots
[4:46:43] <Scamsy> i think you are against centralized economies and authoritarianism but that's not communism that's just the lenin way of doing it
[4:46:43] <%Irridium> profit incentive Kappa
[4:46:44] <penitentpendant> *cost
[4:46:48] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> MUST PROTECC KIM
[4:46:56] <heartlesshealer> wasn't china also destroyed by europe going, "we want your stuff, trade with us for this thing we made you want" and the thing was drugs?
[4:47:02] <Johannen> @teefpal Soviet famine of 1932–33
[4:47:02] <+Robowar98> Humans will never reach the ideas we create ourselves
[4:47:03] <dukenux> i ponered about a possibility of a socialist system that's rather decentralised and allows, or even encourages denizens to own guns
[4:47:06] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @heartlesshealer yuuuuuup
[4:47:09] <WeepyDevil> @heartlesshealer yes
[4:47:09] <teefpal> All Commie countries were and are some flavor of ML
[4:47:10] <derap41> Humanist Woolie
[4:47:14] <andre11dr> must get those pockets full masasn
[4:47:20] <teefpal> or offshoots based on ML
[4:47:25] <Darkdrill> the best system should just be to Steal the best ideas form every side and toss the rest.
[4:47:25] <WeepyDevil> china didn't become a shithole out of nowhere
[4:47:25] <tattleworm> the way this game puts it is that communism is literally impossible to achieve, but every step towards it's goals makes the world a better place so it's a worthwhile endeavour
[4:47:26] <iacus_> ML?
[4:47:36] <teefpal> Marxist Leninism
[4:47:37] <DatAsuna> @heartlesshealer Partly, but we also have a long history of internal conflict, assassination and the like
[4:47:43] <derap41> Woolie is a Social Humanist then
[4:47:48] <Scamsy> @dukenux look at libertarian socialist societies like rojava or the EZLN
[4:48:01] <iacus_> humanist seems like the best way to go
[4:48:06] <%krispen_wa> just because you're correct doesn't mean you're right
[4:48:08] <Ids560> Woolie the character you're playing is a crazy person who doesn't do anything by halves
[4:48:09] <teefpal> Those guys are dependent on USA
[4:48:12] <dukenux> i know keeping the status que might quite possibly kill many of us
[4:48:14] <iacus_> integrative humanism should be the next organizative step
[4:48:20] <derap41> Woolie communism literally said to kill everyone that is richer than you
[4:48:21] <teefpal> and existing within capitalist countries
[4:48:21] <dukenux> *status quo
[4:48:21] <tattleworm> militant humanism
[4:48:23] <+Robowar98> woolie is a enlightenment scholar shoved into the absurd modern world
[4:48:27] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @woolieversus because you're being logical and fair but the game is pointing out the issues of each system with hyperbole
[4:48:39] <+Jeshk0> thats why you just embrace oblivion. The GLOAMING
[4:48:41] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @robowar98 totes my goat
[4:48:41] <Darkdrill> OH no Woolie is Extrememly normal NotLikeThis
[4:48:43] <%purps26> the devs thanked Marx and Engels when they accepted their game award. it's obvious what they think
[4:48:48] <heartlesshealer> Okay, thanks guys, I'll look into pre-europe factors too. I only knew about food problems happening post-opiates
[4:48:49] <derap41> Its not the real world its Harry mind fiction
[4:48:54] <DatAsuna> normcore
[4:48:56] <teefpal> Enlightenment scholars were mostly unscientific fart-sniffers
[4:48:56] <penitentpendant> Praise the Boring Cop!
[4:48:57] <Darkdrill> LUL
[4:48:58] <Davimotion96> That's what Kim is for
[4:49:01] <Johannen> Woolie the Sunday Friends
[4:49:03] <%krispen_wa> Sunday Woolie
[4:49:03] <doctorbeedrill> passive woolie i love it
[4:49:03] <%livlinn> LUL
[4:49:06] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @heartlesshealer Chinese history is extremely interesting
[4:49:12] <%cobalt_phoenix_> im here for normal woolie
[4:49:13] <seriousink> the lead author for DE has also gone on record as saying the game is actively aggressive at you about it's topics to maintain engagement. s'why the game keeps calling you "pig"
[4:49:14] <+Jeshk0> woolie confirmed as normie
[4:49:19] <teefpal> True, warlord period was crazy
[4:49:20] <WeepyDevil> wow, i wonder if this game might be saying soemthing by how its silly hyberpolic communism seems still kind of reasonable comapred to the silly hyperbolic versions of other ideologies
[4:49:22] <Explodincatz> basic punch Madden
[4:49:27] <dukenux> were facing unprecented climate crisis, and the number of refugees around the world double in these two decades. we can't continue as we did
[4:49:29] <Darkdrill> no i completely agree
[4:49:35] <%livlinn> woolieFUN PrideShrug
[4:49:40] <ronin19xx> Every side has its extremes. No use sinking there
[4:49:42] <doctorbeedrill> perspective indeed
[4:49:43] <iacus_> I believe true centrists are anything but normal. Most people are drawn to some form of tribalist side, bcause it's the natural momentum
[4:49:51] <teefpal> Need to do more research, because that would make a great setting
[4:49:52] <%krispen_wa> Woolie eats boiled chicken without salt
[4:49:53] <tattleworm> oh no, you'd absolutely have to shed a lot of blood to achieve communism, bezos' private army aren't gonna disband themselves
[4:50:04] <WeepyDevil> i mean "true centrist" is a silly thing
[4:50:12] <andre11dr> Well, the quests for the political parties do go down some insane paths that make you choose between being for it or giving yourself the Hitler mustache
[4:50:19] <teefpal> Yeah nobodys saying that their ideology is bloodless
[4:50:19] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:50:35] <Asuterisuku> Alright, now that the stream is ending it's back to STRIVIN
[4:50:37] <WeepyDevil> it's like the old dnd "true neutral", where you have to actively fight for a balance between all things
[4:50:42] <dukenux> @Scamsy yes i was thinking about them, and similar projects.
[4:50:47] <teefpal> The smart liberals dont, the fascists def dont, the commies dont, the smart anarchists dont
[4:50:53] <%Gruhunchously> The problem with bloody revolution is that it's really hard to determine when enough blood has been shed to achieve the world you want to see
[4:51:03] <teefpal> everybody knows political power comes from the barrel of a gun
[4:51:11] <Asuterisuku> Weird translation then.
[4:51:13] <%Gruhunchously> And how much blood needs to be she to maintain the world you want to see
[4:51:21] <iacus_> well, no, Disco Elysium treats centrism as if it were DND true neutral (ie boring) but it's not that
[4:51:24] <%krispen_wa> just spill the blood of the people you dont like
[4:51:25] <andre11dr> @teefpal Not wrong
[4:51:26] <mr_sups> I am the Walrus!
[4:51:28] <teefpal> Status quo is also an Ideology
[4:51:34] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @gruhunchously and you inherently build a movement against you if there's any survivors
[4:51:41] <Scamsy> i mean most political fight doesn't come through blood or guns but through infrastructure and culture and education
[4:51:42] <andre11dr> When has peace brought any change
[4:51:44] <Asuterisuku> Vous is often used in place of Tu in a position of respect.
[4:51:46] <Scamsy> guns are 1% of it
[4:51:47] <doctorbeedrill> lol
[4:51:47] <iacus_> being equidistant means being against all forms of tyranny, and not just allowing those on "your" side
[4:51:48] <WeepyDevil> @iacus_ that's not actually what dnd true neutral si though lol
[4:52:00] <+elhafnero> i think the game shows that the centrists are also extremely violent, hence martinaise getting blown up
[4:52:02] <DatAsuna> you know your language is dumb when it makes english look sensible
[4:52:03] <teefpal> Kim is a good moralist
[4:52:03] <WeepyDevil> dnd true neutral isn't (Well, it used to not be) jsut a boring middle ground
[4:52:04] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> English is stupid af lol
[4:52:04] <Equirah> that's every other estern language woolie
[4:52:11] <Asuterisuku> The Royal You, as it were.
[4:52:12] <Equirah> *western
[4:52:21] <brunoberserk> omelette du fromage
[4:52:27] <teefpal> Dickso
[4:52:29] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> so many rules that have exceptions English kills me and I'm a native English speaker lol
[4:52:32] <Robot_Nixon_> @andre11dr argueably we're in a peaceful time, and we experienced the internet
[4:52:47] <+ReallyBigRocks> English is a lot of stuff that makes sense and then a bunch of the worst parts of other languages because no one wanted to translate that stuff
[4:52:50] <WeepyDevil> its total insanity "i will fight with the bad guys if the good guys are winning to strong, i will fight with law/chaos if chaos/law is doing to good", "muh balance" shit
[4:52:51] <iacus_> @WeepyDevil what is it then? In most games I've seen it implemented True Neutral is some sort of boring "balance all things equally" bs
[4:52:54] <doctorbeedrill> vanilla ware???
[4:52:57] <%livlinn> OhMyDog
[4:53:00] <romc215> 13 Sentinels was awesome
[4:53:01] <Darkdrill> Nice
[4:53:06] <+Robowar98> we are all Harry and the other part of the metaphor is lost to memory
[4:53:06] <andre11dr> @robot_nixon_ Well that was technically get started during the cold war
[4:53:10] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> ayyyyeee
[4:53:15] <DatAsuna> good game, good essay
[4:53:18] <Ids560> English does have a lotta stuff that's been stapled to it over the years
[4:53:22] <teefpal> And memory is lost to the pale
[4:53:22] <DatAsuna> JayEM
[4:53:24] <%krispen_wa> True Neutrals look out for themselves and just do stuff that benefits them and the people they like
[4:53:28] <Asuterisuku> Nago plays a lot better now than he did in Beta 2.
[4:53:29] <Mattais88> 13 Sentials was easily GOTY
[4:53:39] <teefpal> So narcissists?
[4:53:53] <iacus_> Well, that's what I meant. That's boring and simplistic ot me lol. makes no actual sense
[4:53:53] <WeepyDevil> @krispen_wa yeah, thats not how it was actually supposed to be, although your description makes way more sense
[4:53:54] <DatAsuna> It's a fairly small channel, so I doubt it will do huge views
[4:53:57] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> I've never met a true neutral cause at the end of the day everyone has a partially flawed or warped perspective, it's part of being human
[4:54:03] <DatAsuna> But still a fun watch for those who know
[4:54:04] <%Gruhunchously> @krispen_wa A lot of people are like that, more than they'd care to admit
[4:54:19] <DatAsuna> 3 tracks of content dropping all in the same evening
[4:54:28] <teefpal> We cant see how warped our own perspective is
[4:54:31] <doctorbeedrill> Nippon Ichi Software??
[4:54:36] <WeepyDevil> like, law/chaos, sure, but the idea that "oh no, goods winning too much, i gotta go be evil now" is insane
[4:54:38] <DatAsuna> But you ARE an alcoholic
[4:54:46] <%krispen_wa> true neutrals are a majority of people because people are usually busy trying to survive to care much about idealogy
[4:54:51] <WeepyDevil> and also clearly animals, which where lsited as TN, didn't give a fuck
[4:55:01] <%Gruhunchously> Still dealing with the mother of all hangovers
[4:55:05] <DatAsuna> Movie length
[4:55:10] <Mattais88> Oh Shit, It's out?!
[4:55:11] <romc215> Remember, Wompty Dompty Dom. It sounds silly, but it can lead to many, many advantages
[4:55:11] <%cobalt_phoenix_> woolieLORE woolieLORE woolieLORE
[4:55:13] <WeepyDevil> most people don't think "i will work with the republicans ebcause the liberals are doing to well right now"
[4:55:15] <DatAsuna> both parts
[4:55:15] <heartlesshealer> The second part finished uploading? 👀
[4:55:19] <iacus_> yeah and that's what strawmen on twitter believe centrism is."Compromise with the bad guys" and it's not that
[4:55:20] <%livlinn> woolieLORE woolieGLORY
[4:55:20] <teefpal> Theres nothing more intensely nauseating than seeing your life from the view of a super-rich guy giving you life advice while hes on vacation

[4:55:36] <heartlesshealer> very good work, opening tab for second part now
[4:55:41] <doctorbeedrill> chaos!!!
[4:55:47] <SonofMelonHead> True neutral is an aspect of d&d alignment, which is conceptually incoherent.
