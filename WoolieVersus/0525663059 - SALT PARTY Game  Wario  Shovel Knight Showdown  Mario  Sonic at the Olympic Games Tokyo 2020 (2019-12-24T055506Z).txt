[0:25:19] <T_Sasquatch> Just because it's on Snopes doesn't mean shit LMAO
[0:25:22] <+Flambage> It was a loophole that is real but wouldn't hold up in court
[0:25:25] <PlainSimpleTailor> It would definitely be a federal offense, surely
[0:25:29] <$ofloofy> What did i just walk into Kappa

[0:25:55] <%MayorRev> bruh i just got here what the hell is going on
[0:26:00] <@Solidus_113> It's a loophole thing
[0:26:01] <Arek_1> I just looked up "Zone of Death."
[0:26:01] <+laxomusic> you're just AFRAID OF THE TRUTH
[0:26:02] <%CaptainPileDriver> The constitutional loophole in this area was discovered by Michigan State University law professor Brian C. Kalt while he was planning to write an essay about technicalities of the Sixth Amendment, which entitles citizens to a fair and quick trial. Kalt wondered about a hypothetical place where there were not enough eligible citizens to form a jury and theorized that there could be no trial and therefore no punishment for major crimes in that area.
[0:26:13] <+bread_assassin> Don't doubt me, Woolie
[0:26:14] <valriot> America is fuckin dumb LUL
[0:26:14] <Man_in_the_Red> and they are not kidding, yellowstone can probably extridite someone to the US Kappa
[0:26:17] <%MayorRev> do not talk about the zone of death!!
[0:26:19] <Solidnick18> i've been to yellowstone along time ago

[0:26:52] <@Menitta> america is a PVP zone
[0:26:52] <xeros720> watch that music video, "This is America" it's very thorough
[0:26:53] <T_Sasquatch> An immigrant country built on slavery
[0:26:55] <ShawnEXE> That's what happens when you don't connect the chiral network
[0:26:57] <%CaptainPileDriver> However, the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution decrees that a trial must happen both within the district and state of where the crime was committed. Because of this, a crime committed in the "Zone of Death" would be constitutionally required to be tried in and include only jury members from the Zone.
[0:27:01] <CroiX2120> but it most likely wont for a while

[0:30:03] <+Milpool> They'd assemble a jury from the next district over. There was a case of this for poaching where the judge ruled that to be the process when a jury couldn't be assembled.

[0:35:13] <+cvp5127> lol who listen to the podcast for news
[0:35:15] <The_500lb_Child> Barf Arc is the best Arc
[0:35:15] <Vyneci> The only thing I didn't like about the podcast is that YOU DIDN'T MAKE IT 5 HOURS LONG
[0:35:16] <%HDmexiqtioner> The Barf Arc
[0:35:17] <%Vegaburd> TBH podcast coulda used some more barf
[0:35:18] <%Ecchigun> @WoolieVersus stay you, thats why we here

[0:35:41] <Nekros4442> @WoolieVersus Just so you know. I literally palyed that Podcast while I was working in the warehouse without headphone or earplugs and the guy who was listening to it with me was laughing his head off
[0:35:47] <primaryfire> can't please everyone so just go with the flow and attract the people who like what they're hearing
[0:35:48] <+l33t_j4gu4r> I added barf bag to my everyday carry items
[0:35:50] <+saladin1911> If you're a person listening to a 4 hour podcast to get some video game news then you should perhaps rethink your decisions sbfpSetIn
[0:35:50] <@Menitta> the podcast this week was almost 5 hours. You can get both

[0:40:53] <WG101> SALT PARTY?!
[0:40:56] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus Supermash is already out on PC. Exclusive to the Epic Game Store
[0:41:14] <LudacrisGibs> spinoff
[0:41:21] <yuribo26> Not confusing at all, just like the Wii U
[0:41:23] <rubbishbinge> ASHLEY
[0:41:41] <@Menitta> Was Wario Ware Gold any good
[0:41:42] <xeros720> got to respect wario's hustle, sits down and programs videogames
[0:41:56] <0rond> is there no wario ware type game for the switch? you'd they push it harder considering the switch basically encourages this type of thing with stuff like 1 2 switch
[0:42:01] <jumad390> i want to see them do Gamer so bad
[0:42:01] <Madovir> it's a tech demo
[0:42:04] <waterstealer> no they are microgames

[0:43:57] <@Menitta> That Luigi's Mansion game was amazinf
[0:43:58] <JigsK> nintendo world was the best
[0:44:02] <tattleworm> the completely untapped power of the wii u
[0:44:03] <Graxe_> Chat is chaotic neutral
[0:44:03] <+cvp5127> THE WII U HAD GAMES
[0:44:03] <Zayasu> wii u gimmicks PogChamp
[0:44:06] <+Darren716> Man the Wii U is so sad, they should have used the game pad so much more for stuff like this
[0:44:12] <%wolfofsound> so this is it? the power of the wii u?
[0:44:23] <Graxe_> Don't trust our input
[0:44:27] <Prevot> the wii u is my gamecube
[0:44:28] <+TopTieramisu> wii ui
[0:44:44] <%yeknomlive> curtains remind me of paper mario ttyd
[0:44:51] <0rond> it's like spy party
[0:44:56] <%Irridium> screenwatch and you get punched
[0:45:03] <AceOne5> They were on the right track because the controller greatly resembles a Switch, they just had to realize its potential
[0:45:10] <+Dr_DangerPhD> WiiU gamepad had so much potential and tons of devs just slapped a minimap/inventory on it and called it a day
[0:45:34] <+l33t_j4gu4r> I really hope for a rerelease of wonderful 101
[0:45:40] <yuribo26> @Dr_DangerPhD more like a lot of devs just put a black screen there LUL

[2:13:33] <DedlokPM> @Arek_1 Woolie showed him in the first episode of Fighterpedia as a factoid of him being in the cut content in SF2, then used him as a running gag in the rest of the the Fighterpedia episodes. Then he became a kind of Best Friends Play staple and then the guys kickstarter tiered him into various games
[2:13:42] <+dmtjinni> I swear there is no stream like The Woolie Versus™ stream

[2:38:25] <+radpuffin> casual vs cup lol

[2:40:36] <SiegeJay> @fatally_furious Crimson Edgedmen
[2:41:02] <+captain_history> plague campaign is also super fun
[2:41:05] <SiegeJay> Eclipse Edgedmen lol?
[2:41:08] <Man_in_the_Red> fitting since the thief class in path of exile is carrying straight up torture instruments
[2:41:14] <%yeknomlive> dam chester

[2:42:49] <WG101> yeah
[2:42:51] <WG101> with tt
[2:42:53] <DedlokPM> Minh is Donkey Kong
[2:42:58] <+captain_history> yeah I think so
[2:43:11] <+captain_history> this is the game that keeps giving
[2:43:12] <DrStinkers> Minh can turn any character into a zoner
[2:43:17] <Solidnick18> polar knight so beefy
[2:43:17] <DedlokPM> @fatally_furious yeah it comes with treasure trove
[2:43:18] <+LurkerGene> He is too stronk

[2:43:53] <@Solidus_113> I don't hear any salt in this party
[2:43:53] <DrStinkers> Ming has been forced to use 50% of his power
[2:44:05] <GrimEnigma> is baz not playable?
[2:44:07] <Lamedhos> my limiters are off - minh
[2:44:14] <%yeknomlive> minh retrieval arc
[2:44:17] <Saltmeisterr> baz is playable
[2:44:20] <WG101> @grimenigma he is
[2:44:23] <$SilverRoddo> This is not even Minh’s final form!?
[2:44:35] <DedlokPM> @grimenigma he is playable. Woolie played him 3-4 times in a row when they started
[2:44:52] <GrimEnigma> ahh dam i missed it
[2:44:53] <%yeknomlive> i love treasure knight's stage theme
[2:44:58] <%CaptainPileDriver> PICK SHIELD KNIGHT
[2:45:04] <%CaptainPileDriver> SHIELD KNIGHT IS THE SHIT
[2:45:06] <Saltmeisterr> no he ain't tankier
[2:45:16] <GrimEnigma> THE BAZ
[2:45:17] <Prevot> having a main after 10 min
[2:45:18] <ChrisM341> YEYEYE
[2:45:19] <Orenjevel> green baz
[2:45:22] <Saltmeisterr> polar knight jut has big hitboxes
[2:45:25] <Solidnick18> more baz
[2:46:24] <Orenjevel> baz: PIKAAA
[2:46:24] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1204820081542402050?s=19
[2:46:35] <%yeknomlive> minh's playing like dr wily
[2:46:39] <Saltmeisterr> but ye, liquid samurai is probably the most technical character
[2:46:57] <Saltmeisterr> but once u get used to him hes super fun
[2:47:03] <%allups> baz might be low tier
[2:47:06] <Saltmeisterr> his movement is really good
[2:47:15] <@Solidus_113> as he deserves
[2:47:21] <%yeknomlive> appropriate
[2:47:23] <%MayorRev> coward
[2:47:25] <%MayorRev> LUL
[2:47:26] <Saltmeisterr> yea baz's electrify is not that good
[2:47:32] <WG101> OOF
[2:47:44] <zepelinnn1> minh is great at laming holy damn LUL
[2:47:44] <%MayorRev> gg
[2:47:47] <Man_in_the_Red> god, never thought i'd see the day Baz is playable in more than one... "fighting game"
[2:47:56] <Prevot> baz being low tier is exactly as it should
[2:48:05] <$SilverRoddo> You step up before you can backdown.
[2:48:11] <Prevot> if anything he needs to be nerfed more
[2:48:36] <+Someone_Kooky> Reize is important in specter knight
[2:48:40] <Saltmeisterr> both reizes are upper fun
[2:48:45] <Saltmeisterr> super*
[2:48:53] <Shoegum> Supper fun
[2:48:58] <+captain_history> yeah, shovel knight is gold
[2:48:58] <Prevot> I mean, they only made one game
[2:49:01] <Saltmeisterr> normal reize haz sum gud stuff
[2:49:12] <%allups> is tht the last game of the night
[2:49:24] <clamlamity> "One game" that's like, 3 or 4 games in one.
[2:49:25] <Saltmeisterr> they might as well made 5 games at this point
[2:49:28] <Man_in_the_Red> @prevot so have team cherry, but they might as well be multiple
[2:49:35] <%MayorRev> its the best
[2:49:39] <%MayorRev> so much content
[2:49:59] <Man_in_the_Red> that one guy is right, indie games are too cheap
[2:50:01] <Saltmeisterr> its a bit more expense tho
[2:50:16] <Saltmeisterr> right now treasure trove is 40 bucks
[2:50:21] <%allups> i only play it on vita
[2:50:23] <@Solidus_113> Jake Kaufman, the absolute god on the music
[2:50:24] <Saltmeisterr> I think it used to be 25?
[2:50:33] <%allups> ik bought it there ima keep it there
[2:50:35] <@Solidus_113> You can buy all the OSTs on his Bandcamp
[2:50:36] <DedlokPM> yeah I think they raised the price up to $40 once the king knight and showdown released
[2:50:36] <Prevot> cave story is so old tho, was it even retro back then?
[2:50:57] <@Solidus_113> Treasure Trove with Showdown is $40 now
[2:51:11] <NiktenKing> Shoveled dirt cheap even
[2:51:24] <DedlokPM> @WoolieVersus they raised the price up to $40 once the king knight expansion and showdown released
[2:51:33] <Solidnick18> PogChamp
[2:51:45] <Man_in_the_Red> good, they deserve the cash for making 3 megaman games and the second good platform fighter
[2:51:47] <Saltmeisterr> its still worth it at 40 bucks
[2:51:50] <Prevot> The Baz amiibo when
[2:51:50] <+jiggy_snipe> I think it's interesting that Shovel Knight gets more expensive over time
[2:51:54] <acewulf77> Shoulder Knight when
[2:51:55] <Lamedhos> The Baz lives again
[2:51:56] <SiegeJay> @Solidus_113 Only issue with Jake Kaufman is his Gamergate involvement.
[2:51:59] <%MayorRev> Shovel Knight and Baz are the cameo kings
[2:52:04] <%yeknomlive> FOR GLORY

[3:37:05] <Uselesswhitenoise> i hope they get to some of the three players games
[3:37:06] <DedlokPM> It's more mind games than straight out fighting, so yeah I can see how people would not like it as much
[3:37:11] <Man_in_the_Red> maybe it'd be clearer if youve played Karate Champ
[3:37:23] <tattleworm> it's gotta be really quick for an ippon
[3:37:27] <@Solidus_113> Ippon is instant
[3:37:44] <Uselesswhitenoise> how long the struggle last
[3:38:10] <SuperKirby24> this reminds me of the ljn snes wwf games
[3:38:24] <SuperKirby24> with that momentum meter
[3:39:05] <%CaptainPileDriver> so from what i've been catching about capcom cup, the fucking setup was lagging stupid hard
[3:39:10] <+leomuratore> Gat into fighting games: Mario and Sonic at the Olympics
[3:39:23] <%CaptainPileDriver> like, to the point they stopped mid set to fix it
[3:40:03] <Graxe_> Dream Karate

[3:41:37] <Man_in_the_Red> Niddhogg is more atari looking
[3:41:38] <%yeknomlive> i hope daisy just full screen lunges
[3:41:39] <Breakfast_Megapowers> Nidhogg is a For Fun game obviously
[3:41:41] <NeroInfinite> Nidhogg for fun night
[3:41:42] <SuperKirby24> plot twist daisy is garbage in this Kappa

[3:42:21] <metabot64> woolie has to have the capcom cup open on the side or some shit right?
[3:42:31] <%CaptainPileDriver> i cannot believe the setup at capcom cup is so bad that they stopped mid set to fix it

[3:43:57] <%yeknomlive> it's the game
[3:44:00] <WG101> nyo-ho
[3:44:00] <EnderGamma> it's the score counter not the mic
[3:44:06] <+Vostroyan1> that beeping sound is a fencing thing?
[3:44:14] <+razielhex> yeah
[3:44:16] <WG101> Go! Go! Waluigi!
[3:44:18] <SuperKirby24> yea, it makes a sound when a hit connects
[3:44:20] <Man_in_the_Red> @breakfast_megapowers they didnt bother to change the win animations for the versus
[3:44:31] <+Jintais3rd> Even his athletic shoes are toe pointed
[3:44:36] <+razielhex> they have special sensors on the suit that are connected to a machine and if the tip of the rapier/epee/saber touches it the machine beeps
[3:44:36] <BestTeaMaker> is that beeping coming from here
[3:44:38] <%yeknomlive> "AMY"
[3:44:43] <beatie_g> Waluigi is a stick. Egg man has no chance
[3:44:46] <+Jintais3rd> ADRENALINE
[3:44:52] <Man_in_the_Red> why did they choose a beep like that for hits
[3:44:56] <%CaptainPileDriver> i cannot believe capcom cup is actually being as bad as it is
[3:44:56] <+invisi_bliss> sounds like my god damn smoke alarm jeeezus
