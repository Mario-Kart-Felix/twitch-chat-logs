[0:07:04] <thewizardchan> I suppose Snake Oil is more open-ended than this. You're always making a show here so that might make things either easier or harder depending on how it works.
[0:07:06] <%CaptainPileDriver> 5 big black cocks is a good card
[0:07:23] <dapperskeleton69> my fav black card is "the office of"
[0:07:40] <%CaptainPileDriver> there's also the box jokes

[0:07:56] <%RioGascar> yeah this sounds like snake oil with anime instead of investment pitchs
[0:07:57] <worldbrand> this is going to immediately devolve into Podcast Title: the game

[0:58:45] <%jiggy_snipe> it's a magical girl anime so it works with the title
[0:58:50] <thewizardchan> Is there a minimum card limit of 3? Could you just drop the one?
[0:59:01] <%RioGascar> its 4 words limit
[0:59:15] <thewizardchan> That's the max but what's the min

[1:12:46] <+Pookiedaexzile> Damn
[1:12:58] <%RioGascar> cause sometimes a shit title is hurt less by delaying it and building up the story
[1:12:58] <%Javaa01> Stalling for 3 minutes is too much
[1:12:59] <@Solidus_113> Remember, elevators
[1:13:04] <%Taglog7> Drop the name like the Op would

[1:14:20] <%jiggy_snipe> Megamiken
[1:14:33] <dapperskeleton69> woolie got called out for his keikaku
[1:14:35] <worldbrand> i did like reggie's pitch
[1:14:45] <SlappyMeats> since the title is what you're building with the cards, it should be what is revealed at the end
[1:14:47] <WG101> just needs less space
[1:14:47] <%RioGascar> Eco space
[1:14:51] <+Pookiedaexzile> Boxing Show
[1:14:55] <gogozeppeli_sbr> Reggie killed that round
[1:15:04] <@Solidus_113> every anime must go to space
[1:15:10] <$SilverRoddo> I think the producer should help move the pitch along? Idk. I mean, the producer is a busy person.
[1:15:15] <thewizardchan> If you have a decent title, drop it at the start. If you have a FUCKING WINNER you drop it at the end.
[1:15:17] <%RioGascar> Nah slappy title can be dropped at the start middle or end
[1:15:22] <%Ipsenscastle> Is Woolie wearing Pat's lizardface glasses?
[1:15:32] <dapperskeleton69> welcome to channel A where the titles are made up and the points dont matter Kappa thats right the points are just like woolie's real name doesnt matter
[1:15:33] <NeroInfinite> Nah
[1:15:38] <worldbrand> the producer should be able to interrupt to give them ideas or make them swerve
[1:15:40] <NeroInfinite> PAt kept his lizard glasses

[1:16:39] <$SilverRoddo> Cyber-Dinotopia
[1:16:40] <%Ipsenscastle> that's not what a dystopia is
[1:16:44] <thewizardchan> All utopias are dystopias when you look under the hood
[1:16:45] <+Pookiedaexzile> Woolievwromg
[1:16:48] <NeroInfinite> That's jus t a dystopia
[1:16:48] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:16:49] <NeroInfinite> LUL
[1:16:51] <worldbrand> a dystopia is JUSt the opposite
[1:16:51] <Prevot> isn't this just The Matrix
[1:16:52] <glass_marcus> Dytopia just means shit is fucked
[1:16:54] <HairyRavioliToad> dystopias don't have to appear perfect y'all
[1:16:56] <pirateofpie> A dystopia is just a pile of shit
[1:16:56] <%Taglog7> HahaThink HahaThink HahaThink
[1:16:59] <%jiggy_snipe> Woolie's wrong
[1:17:00] <%RioGascar> 2049 is not a utopia
[1:17:02] <@Solidus_113> It's a perfect dystopia that everyone wants
[1:17:12] <WG101> ANARCHY REIGNS
[1:17:16] <+ggbhtg> big wrong woolie
[1:17:16] <%Theycallmenerf> Not a dystopia not a dystopia not a dystopia
[1:17:18] <+TomServal> @genesisknight Wasn't that also Kikai?
[1:17:18] <SlappyMeats> Utopia is an idyllic society, whereas Dystopia is a broken society
[1:17:21] <mr_miyagucci> Gunma?
[1:17:21] <+Pookiedaexzile> Wrong boy is big Wrong
[1:17:23] <%Ipsenscastle> walk it back woolz
[1:17:26] <%RioGascar> We are in a dystopia
[1:17:27] <worldbrand> but also woolie is just looking for The Ones Who Walk from Omelas
[1:17:27] <%The_Timo> Ha
[1:17:30] <$SilverRoddo> CHAOS REIGNS
[1:17:35] <dapperskeleton69> woolie might as well have put a double negative
[1:17:36] <gogozeppeli_sbr> Over under on reggie taking this pitch to space
[1:17:40] <+GenesisKnight> @TomServal There was less Utopia in Kikai
[1:17:42] <dapperskeleton69> its just CYBPERUNK
[1:17:49] <%jiggy_snipe> so Woolie's concepts cancel out
[1:17:50] <worldbrand> let's go to space babey
[1:17:53] <%RioGascar> Star trek tng is utopia
[1:17:53] <NeroInfinite> YEAH

[1:18:17] <$SilverRoddo> Tek War Wasteland
[1:18:22] <SlappyMeats> HOWEVER, Woolie's explanation is certainly how you could reconcile the dystopia/utpoia idea
[1:18:24] <dapperskeleton69> you TOOL
[1:18:26] <+Pookiedaexzile> "Theres a ws;l
[1:18:30] <WG101> Neon Wasteland

[1:26:45] <%jiggy_snipe> so Gundam
[1:26:46] <powerprotoman> so she just ask for them to make gundam
[1:26:49] <%alrobot2014> wait robots

[1:27:04] <%Taglog7> MECH ASSAULT
[1:27:07] <SlappyMeats> Short Circuit
[1:27:07] <misunderstood_poo> Patlabor

[1:27:21] <+Pookiedaexzile> So all Real Robot shows
[1:27:24] <worldbrand> see this still works with punch mom because she sounds like an actual producer who would exist
[1:27:24] <%RioGascar> I would play ace combat + mechs SO GOD DAMN MUCH RIGHT NOW
[1:27:25] <thewizardchan> So literally Gundam
[1:27:27] <%jiggy_snipe> Ace Combat with mechs would be cool

[1:27:56] <WG101> if you say "it's not about the robots, but the pilots" you immediately lose
[1:28:02] <%The_Timo> "What do you mean her Chassis is under 18?!" DUN DUN DUNNNN
[1:28:05] <%RioGascar> Armored core isnt as melodrama
[1:28:19] <%RioGascar> ace combat somehow toes the line perfectly
[1:28:19] <dapperskeleton69> k
[1:28:20] <SlappyMeats> it's not about the robots, it's about the pilots' pets
[1:28:21] <NeroInfinite> True

[1:57:07] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @GarbageNirvana i would argue that the director and the screen writer took the book at face value(due to political views). I mean the movie does a great job at making satire at hawkish politics and military stuff. But not so much with the aspect of a facist society.

[2:30:41] <%wruce_> WHAT IS A MAN?
[2:30:44] <%RioGascar> board games teach you like it takes 3 rounds/games to get an idea if its fun
[2:31:10] <dapperskeleton69> so whats the winstate
[2:32:38] <HairyRavioliToad> Sacrifice your card for more time on the clock

[2:36:02] <HairyRavioliToad> Woolie has fewer hues but more saturation
[2:36:28] <@Solidus_113> Can't see colours, but can see shades
[2:37:19] <andrei11dr> You'd think The Racist would be the best at seeing colors

[2:47:39] <+hyroph> @dapperskeleton69 playing all cards correctly
[2:48:02] <HairyRavioliToad> @dapperskeleton69 There are 3 end conditions, after which the team is graded. Either the bomb goes off (too many mistakes), all fireworks are lit ("perfection"), or all cards run out
[2:48:09] <dapperskeleton69> so one fuck up loses the game
[2:48:22] <dapperskeleton69> oh boy soggySully
[2:48:28] <HairyRavioliToad> Untrue, the bomb has multiple fuses right?
[2:48:40] <+hyroph> 3 fuses i think?
[2:48:43] <@Solidus_113> take some risks

[2:50:37] <%jiggy_snipe> sure but it would hurt the team
[2:50:49] <+steelmorrigan> It's a co-op game why would you lie?
[2:50:55] <$TIME_PUNCHER> What we playing y'all?
[2:51:05] <andrei11dr> Oh ,yea its a team effort, i forgot
[2:51:14] <HairyRavioliToad> Yeah that's dickish and not fun. The FUN dickery comes where you give true information poorly, like when Minh repeats old info

[3:28:07] <Overloard> is this reverse uno?
[3:28:15] <+Lizard0TM> I have no idea whats happening
[3:28:20] <%jiggy_snipe> @dapperskeleton69 did you participate in the tourney?
[3:28:20] <HairyRavioliToad> Minh is just hustling, pretending to not know how to lay down 1's so it looks impressive when he does
[3:28:20] <+GarlicSCR> hmm
[3:28:29] <Hellarussian> hey you watchagonnado
[3:28:31] <thewizardchan> It's like co-operative solitaire except you can only see other people's cards.
[3:28:31] <worldbrand> :)
[3:28:37] <dapperskeleton69> yeah, lost in my first round and drowned in loser bracket
[3:28:38] <TigerClaws12> uh oh

[3:29:00] <worldbrand> lul
[3:29:07] <dapperskeleton69> NOOOO
[3:29:10] <+TheOlMitcheroo> @Lizard0TM It's pretty simple. Players can't see their own cards. On your turn you can discard a card for time block, use a time block to give a player info about their card, or play a card on the table. You need 1-5 of the same color to get more time.
[3:29:10] <dapperskeleton69> the shades

[3:42:14] <HairyRavioliToad> Like if I ask "got any 2's", I therefore must have a 2

[3:50:53] <unclerizla> @Megaleg Hey now. I grew up with RT and damn if they haven't produced a ton of very enjoyable content over the years. Not only that, but they've made themselves a bit of a media conglomerate. Burnie Burns and Matt Hullum have done a heck of a job
[3:51:10] <dapperskeleton69> it was absolutely a true story
[3:51:22] <+TheOlMitcheroo> I for one welcome our teethed rooster overlords

[3:52:02] <%Jetzord> Million dollars but whatever lore we make about you (large consensus only) becomes reality
[3:52:09] <unclerizla> But does Woolie actually have an association with Roosterteeth now? I know SBFP had some sort of thing going, but I assumed that became null
[3:52:16] <%K2YP70C0CK> Micheal McDonal scene
[3:52:29] <dapperskeleton69> yes CSB is sponsored by rooster teeth
[3:52:32] <+Lizard0TM> CSB is a part of Rooster Teeth
[3:52:33] <dapperskeleton69> affiliated
[3:52:40] <andrei11dr> It's like the Black Star thing
