[0:03:29] <Super_Voltekka> None of the characters from AoF3 barring Kasumi ever appeared in another game
[0:03:45] <%ggbhtg> not humble beginnings. BUMBLE Beginnings.
[0:03:50] <andre11dr> Mr Big and Kisaragi where also there

[0:06:13] <alphalejandro> you pick the worst gameplay wise
[0:06:30] <Super_Voltekka> They blew all the budget in animation, that they forgot how to make a competent fighting game LUL
[0:06:52] <andre11dr> The Fatal Fury series was always aeons above the AoF games
[0:07:28] <alphalejandro> @andre11dr If Garou wasn't any indication

[0:07:57] <andre11dr> Especiali once Real Bout showed up ,those games still look incredible
[0:08:26] <%ChoculaUltra> I remember seeing Duck King's sprites as a kid and thinking "this is the future of video games" LUL
[0:08:34] <seydaq> was this the first snk game with an auto combo?
[0:08:34] <Canadian_Suit> what's reggies last name?

[0:09:41] <+BusterRepukken> not on original hardware? :P lol
[0:09:41] <andre11dr> I would be cool if some of the better AoF caracters showed up ,Like the Claw guy
[0:09:46] <leomuratore> That's a nice jacket, Woolie
[0:09:46] <%CaptainPileDriver> reggie looking SUS
[0:09:56] <%zeroarturia> This game did gave us Kasumi though so that's a plus.

[0:11:03] <andre11dr> Oh that's right, Robert has his 98 design in this
[0:11:09] <Prevot> so THAT'S why this game sucks, then?
[0:11:14] <%jdhwash> jdhwash subscribed at Tier 1.
[0:11:28] <%bvanbove> Robert is one stylish motherfucker
[0:11:35] <leomuratore> Looks great for its time
[0:11:39] <%ggbhtg> oh SNK and their CHOHATSU mechanics
[0:11:40] <HolyGriddles> King was an AoF character? Not Fatal Fury?

[0:12:09] <alphalejandro> @HolyGriddles She came from AOF
[0:12:10] <andre11dr> King was AoF she never was in an FF game
[0:12:20] <ElPlasa> This almost looks like 2D Tekken
[0:12:21] <Who_lio42> you RESPECT JIN FU-HA
[0:12:29] <Super_Voltekka> Wang has a pet pelican how did this guy not appear in KOF?
[0:12:32] <%ggbhtg> CHOHATSUUUUUU
[0:12:37] <seydaq> wang is an artist with a pet pelican

[0:14:48] <Tha_DiLA> Never really played AoF3, but I'm glad more people are getting the chance to appreciate its sprite work
[0:14:57] <floralkami> doot doot muthafucka

[0:15:59] <andre11dr> Is that second hand Benimaru ?
[0:16:01] <Tha_DiLA> oh yeah, doesn't this whole game take place in Mexico?
[0:16:04] <%ggbhtg> AND MAKIIIIII
[0:16:06] <alphalejandro> It's a shame that, not only this game, but the entire series was mostly bad, probably the weakest SNK franchise along with World Heroes
[0:16:11] <leomuratore> What a cool stage
[0:16:15] <el_cores> Rody A.K.A. Benimaru with tonfas
[0:16:16] <jv5_guy> stripper police officer
[0:16:29] <xUrbanCarnage> Pls bring Maki back capcom
[0:16:31] <prime_name> Everything about this screams "Arcade Fighter".
[0:16:46] <floralkami> @alphalejandro bad as in they play like shit, or bad as in they are underplayed?
[0:16:46] <plushysceptile> Didn't they do a load of rotoscoping for this?
[0:16:58] <%ggbhtg> That actually looked like a Kensei Sacred Fist combo with their Segal clone LUL
[0:17:11] <Tha_DiLA> judging from the opening, yes @plushysceptile
[0:17:17] <+BusterRepukken> i love fighting game sprite backgrounds.

[0:21:44] <brunoberserk> @WoolieVersus Jin is from eiji kisaragi's clan
[0:21:58] <+BusterRepukken> you should see real bout fatal fury special for more great animation
[0:22:00] <prime_name> Jin was in Sunday Night Salty Bets series I think
[0:22:05] <Who_lio42> remember you can jab fireballs out of the air in this game
[0:22:06] <+patrickng714> i hope KOFXV brings Jin back

[0:25:12] <%illicitdonut> @floralkami why create multiple fighting games that are similar to each other when you can consolidate them into one franchise?

[0:28:40] <%illicitdonut> @RandoChris true. I like that each game has their own distinctive flairs. But I'm thinking more from a business perspective, it's just easier to support a small handful of games. Is that boring? Yup.
[0:28:41] <+0neReeler> the sound effects are the same as kof97
[0:28:46] <+0neReeler> *character select

[0:30:56] <floralkami> yo
[0:31:19] <%SableS139a> @illicitdonut Supporting a smaller number of games that have their own flair is ultimately easier. And if you have additional manpower, you can focus on more games with their own dedicated divisions. It works out.
[0:31:24] <+Struggleful> TRY next round ya scrub
[0:31:26] <ElPlasa> @RandoChris Absolute. Pants. N I R V A N A
[0:31:31] <andre11dr> Ryo got one hell of a mullet im this game
[0:31:34] <brunoberserk> of course reggie likes sinclair , is the feet right ? LUL
[0:31:42] <+BusterRepukken> AOF came out in 92. Samsho 1 is 93.
[0:31:42] <%RandoChris> Wait, I think I know why we didn't get any more Art of Fighting games. Kim Kaphwan stole the budget for any sequels for all of his pants in future KOFs
[0:31:47] <shadowcrisis> Woolie punched Reggie in the va jay jay
[0:32:08] <Applecannon63> Whut and OTG Fireball punch!?
[0:32:25] <%RandoChris> Waaaaang
[0:32:40] <Grimsever88> same kind if idea? of fat?
[0:32:42] <alphalejandro> Ok, AOF1 came out first in 1992, and SamSho1 came later in 1993
[0:32:50] <shadowcrisis> Stop picking on little kids Woolie
[0:32:52] <floralkami> @randochris the franchises were all sacrifices to the Pants behelet
[0:32:55] <%SableS139a> @RandoChris Kim and probably Nako too. Their pants just get additional budget loaded onto them for no good reason.
[0:33:09] <shadowcrisis> That was brutal mikeliveTotalRecall mikeliveWario
[0:33:10] <ElPlasa> W I D E Jin
[0:33:11] <+0neReeler> sf2 3/91, aof 9/92 - snk picked up ex capcom devs
[0:33:16] <+BusterRepukken> Neo Geo is the same system both AOF 1 and Mark of the Wolves play on. It's nuts.
[0:33:27] <floralkami> I forget how that Berserk chaos egg is named
[0:33:42] <ElPlasa> Behelit
[0:33:50] <floralkami> cool, I was close
[0:33:54] <%illicitdonut> @SableS139a yup. Was what I was thinking. Though the fact the SNK has such a large library of fighting games means that their a lot of potential guest characters and teams that can enter into KoF or samurai showdown going forward.
[0:34:01] <%RandoChris> Wang's actually got multiple endings because there's multiple drawings he makes.
[0:34:08] <brunoberserk> OOOOO
[0:34:12] <alphalejandro> YO PogChamp
[0:34:13] <shadowcrisis> Yay Reggie !!!
[0:34:14] <townzzzzz> noice
[0:34:15] <+BusterRepukken> Samsho 5 Special came out in 2004. Neo Geo hung on for a long time.

[0:34:35] <%ggbhtg> SPEED AND WEIGHT
[0:34:37] <%SableS139a> @illicitdonut That's true. It also helps that a lot of SNK's games take place in the same shared universe at different points in time. SNK extended lore is fucking nuts.

[0:36:21] <Who_lio42> jab is the win button
[0:36:21] <%RandoChris> Wyler and Abigail should hang out

[0:36:51] <prime_name> Everything is Vergil
[0:36:52] <Super_Voltekka> Wyler is basically a zombie on roids
[0:37:05] <Jdrockefeller> this is a no shoes allowed fight
[0:37:06] <%RandoChris> Wyler's powered by Big Poppa Pump
[0:37:10] <floralkami> There Woolie goes again, learning the boss characters before the stream
[0:37:10] <Grimsever88> Wy;ler reminds me of the badguy in pineapple express, on roids
[0:37:14] <Jdrockefeller> in a cemetery
[0:37:19] <%illicitdonut> @Super_Voltekka so basically solomon grundy?
[0:37:21] <Jdrockefeller> someone is gonna get infected with something
[0:37:28] <brunoberserk> WYLER SMASH
[0:37:31] <alphalejandro> No green Hulk
[0:37:31] <%RandoChris> He actually is on steroids
[0:37:39] <Applecannon63> Recent FXIV update literally has healer class with a summon sword/fin funnel
[0:37:39] <orpleborple> wyler got hurricane upper
[0:37:48] <+keliff> I've never seen such visible veins in a fighting game
[0:37:49] <+BusterRepukken> it even has the same effect from Samsho
[0:37:53] <shadowcrisis> And one for Reggie mikeliveDon
[0:37:54] <jai_person> I think that parade alley might be a james bond reference, where like he fights the guy with the metal jaw
[0:37:57] <+black_pariah> looks like Darli and can summon swords, woolies new waifu?
[0:38:08] <+0neReeler> that jump kick

[0:38:29] <+0neReeler> bane?
[0:38:42] <Applecannon63> Hey Spear from Primal worked that shit
[0:38:46] <%RandoChris> Wyler's powered by super steroids but after he turns back to normal, he has the mental age of a child.
[0:38:47] <orpleborple> “how abut another go”
[0:38:48] <alphalejandro> Hulk
[0:39:06] <floralkami> @keliff those were veins?? I thought those were bandages
[0:39:09] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> he likes being cute
[0:39:15] <+0neReeler> hulk + tiny bit of saiyan

[0:41:43] <%ggbhtg> Big shoutouts to Strategy Wiki
[0:42:08] <XfourtwoX> there people trashing this game, i think there very cool idea, the string combo are pretty mujch like tekken combo move, otg and many gameplay are like 3d game move
[0:42:21] <DeadlyRaveNeo> this game has tekken elements
[0:42:34] <Grimsever88> Tekken is basically command normal: the game
[0:42:49] <+keliff> love all these charge anims
[0:42:49] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:42:52] <XfourtwoX> the charging move to gain resources as been always a probelm in SNK game
[0:43:02] <+0neReeler> @DeadlyRaveNeo yea reminds me of that, otgs, launchers, chain juggles, wakeup attacks
[0:43:19] <XfourtwoX> Coleman and is punch in the face... best OTG ever
[0:43:21] <+0neReeler> *maybe 3d fighter in general
[0:43:28] <alphalejandro> So like an inverse Super Mario 3D Land and 3D World, a game that looks 2D but plays like 3D...kinda
[0:43:31] <Shardlab> Is this Baz's daughter?

[0:45:14] <Jdrockefeller> JESUS
[0:45:14] <brunoberserk> my biggest problem with this game is the roster , the chars are kind of boring and too simple , AOF 1&2 roster are way more memorable
[0:45:15] <+BusterRepukken> SNK fighting games have lots of truck stop stages
[0:45:18] <%RandoChris> When's Karman gonna toss away his jacket and reveal his Yakuza back tattoo?

[0:48:34] <%illicitdonut> So, after a quick look at wikipedia between 1991 to 2004 there are 54 SNK arcade fighting games. And most of them were made before the year 2000.
[0:48:40] <XfourtwoX> grab by the nipple!!!
[0:48:44] <alphalejandro> Jin Fuha, the most beefe ninja ever
[0:49:00] <jetjagger222> he looks like a human version of the ninja from the ninja warriors
[0:49:02] <%gatorafan> Isn't Robert kinda the protagonist of this game? I know it's usually about Ryo.
[0:49:22] <%RandoChris> @gatorafan Yep. Because blonde nun looking girl is his buddy
[0:49:34] <%RandoChris> From the title sequence
[0:49:42] <andre11dr> @illicitdonut I mean, just KOF and FF would already be like 30 games

[0:50:57] <Applecannon63> indeed a side story since Yuri and Robert are dating in this game
[0:51:02] <alphalejandro> Oh Santana
[0:51:13] <jetjagger222> the sfx on the tonfa is amazing
[0:51:16] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> at least those two dudes are watching

[0:52:08] <andre11dr> Wow SF II is older than me
[0:52:09] <brunoberserk> rody is not a cop , he is a bounty hunter
[0:52:11] <alphalejandro> Shoeless fight
[0:52:13] <Kenny_Riot> @gatorafan You've got good taste
[0:52:17] <%illicitdonut> And 9 fatal fury games
[0:52:20] <Applecannon63> I mean cops have tonfas just off brand

[0:52:43] <+gustavozxd> is there a single good aof game?
[0:52:58] <Hoarseplay> No.
[0:53:00] <jetjagger222> AOF2 is technically pretty good albeit borderline unplayable on single player
[0:53:01] <%gatorafan> @andre11dr, I'm older than Street Fighter 1 FeelsBadMan
[0:53:07] <+gustavozxd> it's no fatal fury but... it can't ALL be bad right....?
[0:53:09] <brunoberserk> @gustavozxd AOF 2 is ok
[0:53:11] <alphalejandro> Look Reggie...FEET
[0:53:16] <PhantomMaskJr> The AoF battle system has always been a huge wtf where they thinking too me HahaElf
[0:53:27] <XfourtwoX> uh,weird, the sword movement are actually form the nord african sword style, but the string are from wu-shu short sword style...
[0:53:37] <Kenny_Riot> @PhantomMaskJr "Had to do something different!"
[0:53:48] <%RandoChris> @Hoarseplay What are YOU doing here, foolish one? SwiftRage
[0:53:56] <+gustavozxd> sucks too cause King is one of my fav fg characters ever but at least she's in good games LUL
[0:53:58] <jetjagger222> you can't play them like you do with SF or fatal fury
[0:54:10] <jetjagger222> they feel a lot more like offshoots of SF1
[0:54:16] <Grimsever88> Feet winms!
[0:54:17] <alphalejandro> cut that feet
[0:54:17] <%gatorafan> Yeah, it will always baffle me how pretty this game is to look at. Never to play. Just look.
[0:54:19] <+Redvc> AOF 2 single player is borderline impossible even on the lowest difficulty
[0:54:24] <Hoarseplay> @RandoChris Don't see people play AOF3 to often.

[0:58:58] <jetjagger222> lee was awesome in AOF2
[0:59:01] <jetjagger222> monke vega
[0:59:02] <andre11dr> As was Mr Big
[0:59:12] <Hoarseplay> What upsets me the most about AOF3 is that this game set a good foundation for a later game, it just needed a gameplay update.
[0:59:15] <%RandoChris> Low spirit botch
[0:59:19] <+gustavozxd> lady mr big
[0:59:44] <Hoarseplay> This is basically the KOF12 of its time.
[0:59:49] <%Mordexai0> Is this the game that confirms Robert and Yuri are a couple?
[0:59:58] <skyentombment> LESGET THE RUNBACK
[1:00:00] <Hoarseplay> @Mordexai0 Yep.
[1:00:00] <alphalejandro> @Hoarseplay wow that bad?

[1:00:27] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @skyentombment
[1:00:31] <jetjagger222> looks like they did their research for the backgrounds
[1:00:37] <Hoarseplay> @alphalejandro It's a bad game in a series of bad games.
[1:00:47] <Hoarseplay> Looks and sounds great, tho.
[1:00:49] <andre11dr> Man it would be really cool if they brought the 96 boss team back, You'd get Geese, Mr Big and Krauser back
[1:01:01] <skyentombment> Be like those asshole kids at the arcade that pick boss characters when they lose
[1:01:07] <%Mordexai0> @hoarseplay wait, I kinda came in a little late, so this game is considered really bad?
[1:01:35] <Hoarseplay> Remember, this is 1996.
[1:01:56] <+Joe2187> Sincalir is bae
[1:02:00] <alphalejandro> @Hoarseplay Owned by a company that have better franchises (FF, SamSho & KOF)
[1:02:05] <%jdhwash> Are you telling me I've been ogling father donk all of this time?
[1:02:08] <jetjagger222> i was wondering why this middle eastern lady was named sinclair
[1:02:15] <skyentombment> @Joe2187 How appropriate that you misspelled it
[1:02:16] <Hoarseplay> @Mordexai0 The AOF series in general is considered bad in terms of SNK's output.
[1:02:28] <Grimsever88> aint legal but regal
[1:02:39] <XfourtwoX> Justing Wong in pereson, LET GO JUSTIN
[1:02:47] <andre11dr> Wasn't Real Bout out bye the time this came out?
[1:02:48] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> brazillian player picks a character with red gi and blonde hair, where have I seen this before hmm
[1:02:50] <Grimsever88> lmao
[1:03:21] <%ggbhtg> Rober too
[1:03:25] <skyentombment> death from above-u
[1:03:26] <%ggbhtg> Robert as well
[1:03:33] <%Mordexai0> @hoarseplay ah. I thought this was considered decent cause it looks fine from first glance.
[1:03:50] <alphalejandro> Didn't Wang have a cameo in KOF2002UM
[1:03:50] <mr_sups> Man that animation is so smooth
[1:03:51] <Hoarseplay> @Mordexai0 It plays like a jank Virtua Fighter with special moves.
[1:03:54] <+Joe2187> Its not a terrible game
[1:03:54] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1356481946692558849?s=19
[1:03:59] <+Joe2187> but its not the best
[1:04:23] <Hoarseplay> At the very least, there's nothing else like it.
[1:04:24] <andre11dr> They gave Robert a dive kick later on
[1:04:33] <PhantomMaskJr> Kasumai is the only character lucky enough to escape the AoF3 jail bronzeJAIL
[1:04:38] <jetjagger222> yup that looks like AOF2 ryo gameplay

[1:05:58] <Hoarseplay> @Mordexai0 VF1. It makes a lot more sense when you approach the game from that angle.

[1:13:42] <Hoarseplay> @Mordexai0 Picking a character on their birthday will give them unlimited desperation.
[1:13:58] <%Mordexai0> @hoarseplay WAIT WHAT

[1:15:58] <alphalejandro> Evil Tony Stark vs Karate Orange
[1:15:58] <+thedream_c> i think Karman is the bouncer?
[1:16:00] <Hoarseplay> SNK pioneered a lot of fighting game mechanics.
[1:16:07] <+thedream_c> at least he's not
[1:16:08] <KNYGHT87> LUL
[1:16:09] <+thedream_c> PIMP Mr Big
[1:16:12] <andre11dr> He's more like a shit version of young Geese from AoF 2
[1:16:16] <%RandoChris> Karman's a high-ranking employee with The Garcia Foundation
[1:16:25] <%RandoChris> Or was it Garcia Concern
[1:16:27] <%ggbhtg> According to Hoarseplay, if you play a character on their birthday in this, they get unlimited Desperation doodWat woolieLORE @woolieversus

[1:16:38] <+thedream_c> yeah AOF series had the ki/stamina bar concept
[1:16:41] <Hoarseplay> @KNYGHT87 Karman Cole is Robert Garcia's bulter.
[1:16:46] <armchairmaster_> Those shades just put him in S tier

[1:17:42] <%ggbhtg> @hoarseplay they gotta read this one out for the chat. does unlimited Des mean infinte meter?
[1:18:00] <alphalejandro> in the SKN universe, if someone has a suit, then that person know how to fight for sure
[1:18:08] <%ggbhtg> Woolie compared Karman to Geese at the start of the stream
[1:18:11] <brunoberserk> lets go another @WoolieVersus

[1:19:15] <%ggbhtg> @hoarseplay at full health?
[1:19:21] <%RandoChris> Yeah
[1:19:30] <+thedream_c> oh Karman has that pickup attack follow up too
[1:19:34] <+thedream_c> sorta like Geesu
[1:19:38] <Hoarseplay> @RandoChris Handler? Keeper? Assistant? Whatever you call it?
[1:19:44] <Hoarseplay> @ggbhtg yep.
[1:19:50] <%Deft_Thought> Damn, that knock-down attack from Karman was smoothly animated
[1:19:58] <%ggbhtg> gotcha

[1:20:41] <%Mordexai0> @woolieversus Apparently characters on their birthday get unlimited desperation meter
[1:20:53] <+dijonaroni> those fucking recoveries of the ground take forever lol
[1:21:00] <Hoarseplay> @illusiveSaint SNK music is great, AOF3 is no exception.
[1:21:05] <andre11dr> Everyone in this game is disrespectful, even the honorable karate man
[1:21:13] <jetjagger222> who's killer, wang or cheng sinzan
[1:21:15] <jetjagger222> *cooler
[1:21:17] <Grimsever88> He's fine, hes got an artists back
[1:21:21] <%RandoChris> He's landing on his pet pelican too
[1:21:39] <%ggbhtg> According to Hoarseplay, if you play a character on their birthday in this, they can do infinite Desperations, including at full health doodWat woolieLORE @woolieversus
[1:21:47] <alphalejandro> Wang have a pelican peet?
[1:22:00] <%RandoChris> Yeah, you can see him whenever Wang gets knocked down
[1:22:05] <PhantomMaskJr> @ggbhtg da fuck HahaElf
[1:22:12] <Hoarseplay> @ggbhtg That's not what rage more does.
[1:22:17] <andre11dr> @jetjagger222 I will say Cheng just because he's stage and song is fire
[1:22:32] <Hoarseplay> Rage mode increases damage and lets you use Ultimate KO.
[1:22:40] <DomonTrigger> imagine playing a game at EVO grand finals on a character's birthday
[1:22:44] <brunoberserk> character changes their stance in low health
[1:23:06] <alphalejandro> oh i see, poor pelican
[1:23:07] <%ggbhtg> you said Unlimited Desperation the first time, guess I have no idea what that means in this game LUL
[1:23:08] <PhantomMaskJr> Always hold tournaments on your mains birthday castleheadLOL
[1:23:10] <%RandoChris> The pelican also assists in one of Wang's moves, I think
[1:23:17] <Applecannon63> Larpers the original Weebs
[1:23:24] <jetjagger222> @andre11dr i think the answer is karnov
[1:23:25] <+illusiveSaint> I'm curious about Wangs lore. Does he return to other AOF games? Why isn't he highlighted in SNK more?
[1:23:27] <Hoarseplay> @UltimateDomon There was a AOF3 tournament on Kasumi's birthday, who's already top tier.
[1:23:49] <%RandoChris> Wang's a friend of Lee, the guy with the monkey mask and claws in AOF 1 and 2
[1:23:57] <DomonTrigger> I'd love to see that in Street Fighter 6
[1:23:58] <Hoarseplay> @illusiveSaint He draws stuff and has a pet pellican.
[1:24:01] <%Mordexai0> @hoarseplay LOL
[1:24:17] <Hoarseplay> AOF3 was a dud, so character in the game are relegated to camoes.
[1:24:20] <%ekodrop> ekodrop subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months! 1 of 2. In college a friend set up an internship program with Arcsys. a few years of the program went well enough that Arc set up a local bb tourney at the uni & donated a bunch of prizes. cs program was in charge and it was a shit show.
[1:24:32] <%Mordexai0> @hoarseplay I can't believe they had a tournament on the top tiers birthday
[1:24:35] <DomonTrigger> "Its Ryu's birthday so his parry window lasts twice as long and he gets infinite Denjins"
[1:24:37] <+illusiveSaint> @hoarseplay that's all i needed to know
[1:24:40] <andre11dr> @jetjagger222 Oh man, now i hope they play Karnovs Revenge after this
[1:24:46] <Hoarseplay> Except Kasumi. She stuck around for whatever reason and she's usually busted in the games she's in.
[1:24:56] <andre11dr> Reggie needs to see the gut
[1:25:03] <%RandoChris> @Hoarseplay Cute anime girl who can fight Kappa
[1:25:04] <jetjagger222> @andre11dr karnov's revenge is low key gdlk
[1:25:17] <%RandoChris> Good job, Reggie!

[1:26:04] <%ekodrop> rest is in a donation message. too long
[1:26:10] <jetjagger222> damn the detail, that glint on the road sign

[1:27:52] <+illusiveSaint> @ekodrop i googled arcsys and that sounds such a cool and privileged thing to have done of course it got shitted on sorry to hear that
[1:27:52] <%AlteisenReiseZ> God, Robert's stance is hilarious
[1:27:58] <andre11dr> I would love Mr Big back in KOF
[1:28:02] <+keliff> love my mans style
[1:28:09] <Hoarseplay> The first Big Bang Beat had the spirit system. it was neat to see that being used in another game.
[1:28:14] <jetjagger222> @AlteisenReiseZ what do you mean avoid unecessary movement
[1:28:16] <Santos_404> Robert is schmoovin'
[1:28:17] <andre11dr> I think the last game he was in was 98
[1:28:28] <Hoarseplay> Sinclair is the worst character in the game, by the way.
[1:28:32] <+keliff> that was a divekick-ass move
[1:28:35] <Hoarseplay> By a wide margin.
[1:28:45] <andre11dr> And Kasumi hasn't been in since 2002 as well
[1:28:47] <alphalejandro> Robert's dancing
[1:28:49] <daniphofani> does Robert's hitbox move with the idle animation
[1:28:55] <%AlteisenReiseZ> he groovin
[1:29:15] <%ggbhtg> Sinclair is the worst character in the game? Feels badminton
[1:29:31] <Hoarseplay> Summon swords is useless. You don't want to use it.
[1:29:46] <jetjagger222> wow that's terrible
[1:29:58] <%ekodrop> @illusiveSaint long story short, Arc was pissed when they found out and cancelled the program
[1:30:09] <%RandoChris> The Hot Rod
[1:30:19] <%AlteisenReiseZ> that sound is hilarious
[1:30:22] <%AlteisenReiseZ> BONK
[1:30:24] <PhantomMaskJr> Sinclair will never be in a KoF game sstHands
[1:30:31] <+illusiveSaint> sinclair is such a cool character she's wasted potential
[1:30:32] <townzzzzz> YES
[1:30:36] <jetjagger222> rody kinda looks like he could be galford's descendant
[1:30:38] <alphalejandro> We have to wait and see what characters appear in KOF15, hope that the developers SHATTER OURS EXPECTATIONS
[1:30:39] <%gatorafan> Rody sending people to horni jail
[1:30:48] <jetjagger222> @alphalejandro karnov for KOF
[1:30:50] <+thedream_c> Roy is a dirty cop
[1:30:53] <%AlteisenReiseZ> I just want Duck King back man
[1:30:57] <%RandoChris> Woolie, they trying to strip Rody on stream 😳
[1:31:05] <Hoarseplay> @illusiveSaint Welcome to suffering of every SNK game that's not KOF.
[1:31:19] <alphalejandro> @AlteisenReiseZ like in KOFXI?
[1:31:26] <+thedream_c> I remember when Yuri/King's top would explode if you finished them with a KI special atk I think
[1:31:37] <%RandoChris> @thedream_c Indeed they did
[1:31:41] <+thedream_c> DESPERARTION?

[1:32:49] <+thedream_c> hmmm
[1:32:52] <andre11dr> But let's be real I would burn every FF and AoF caracter to get Rugal back
[1:32:53] <%Mordexai0> LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOO
[1:32:58] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @alphalejandro yeah

[1:33:11] <townzzzzz> forward half circle forward
[1:33:28] <%ggbhtg> any thoughts, @hoarseplay ?
[1:33:43] <%Mordexai0> Yeah, inject that weird shit in my veins
[1:33:51] <Hoarseplay> @ggbhtg I know some supers in the game are overheads.
[1:33:55] <+illusiveSaint> @ekodrop i knew it that's some spiteful shit at least you got a cool story
[1:34:00] <PhantomMaskJr> @thedream_c majinoBHM_HF FootYellow
[1:34:00] <+thedream_c> oh
[1:34:03] <brunoberserk> hey @WoolieVersus is me ,want help ?
[1:34:06] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> oh
[1:34:16] <%gatorafan> I will never not be upset that Rugalito got hyped as the second protagonist of the Ash saga and then nothing happened in game with him.
[1:34:17] <Hoarseplay> To be fair, you had 60 frames to get out of the way.
[1:34:18] <%RandoChris> Damn man :U
[1:34:21] <+Struggleful> Blocking is UNFUN
[1:34:21] <alphalejandro> @AlteisenReiseZ That was probably the weirdest (but not bad) form of the Fatal Fury team to ever be, Terry, Tizoc and DK
[1:34:21] <%Mordexai0> Unlockable baby!

[1:34:48] <%DaRoosta89> well is it a raging demon?
[1:34:50] <andre11dr> Man SNK just loves to make the main characters OP
[1:34:55] <%ekodrop> @illusiveSaint i don't blame arc, they donated like 10 copies of the game 4 fight sticks and 2 xbox 360s
[1:35:03] <%Mordexai0> Robert Garcia said fuck you I'm the main character
[1:35:08] <Hoarseplay> AOF3 is technically a spinoff and is regarded to as such in the JP title.
[1:35:10] <+thedream_c> I just checked the GameFAQ
[1:35:13] <Bazal68k> @WoolieVersus You guys seen Kasumi's slip behind move? It's super busted.
[1:35:19] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> oof
[1:35:22] <+thedream_c> robert's desperation IS unblockable
[1:35:29] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> this games sick as hell
[1:35:30] <Hoarseplay> Which is why he's the main character in this one.
[1:35:34] <%gatorafan> Remember when Robert decided he waned to be a charge character? This dude is out of control.

[1:54:34] <$Jhylla81> Has any fighter had more moveset/costume changes than Robert Garcia?
[1:54:47] <Hoarseplay> @Jhylla81 Athena Asamiya.

[1:54:57] <alphalejandro> @Jhylla81 Kyo
[1:54:57] <jetjagger222> yoshimitsu?
[1:55:19] <$Jhylla81> Im talking both moveset AND costume though
[1:56:07] <Hoarseplay> In terms of moveset, Kyo Kusanagi has 3 canon movesets, and he has a bunch of clones if you want to count them.
[1:56:10] <andre11dr> @jhylla81 Kyo changed his moveset so many times, we had 5 Kyos in 2002
[1:56:44] <$Jhylla81> Yeah. There's been a lot of Kyos
[1:57:01] <Super_Voltekka> Try to get an Ultimate KO against Lenny and see if her top blows off completely
[1:57:15] <andre11dr> Also Iori gets new supers every now and then
[1:57:24] <Hoarseplay> I miss SNK being experimental with character movesets.
[1:57:35] <alphalejandro> Regular Kyo, Kyo-1, Kyo-2, Kusanagi and EX Kyo/NEST Kyo
[1:57:39] <%RyTYoung> Who made the Art of Fighting series?
[1:57:47] <Zepheri_> SNK
[1:57:49] <andre11dr> And he was completely different in KOF 13
[1:58:03] <%RyTYoung> Neat, the spite work is immense
[1:58:10] <Hoarseplay> Kim Kaphwan has so many moves that SNK keeps making more characters that just have his scrapped old moves.
[1:58:28] <%RyTYoung> Sprite* not spite LUL
[1:58:28] <alphalejandro> @andre11dr Oh with his nail slashes

[1:59:26] <Hoarseplay> Gang-Il, Chae Lim, Dong Hwan, Jae Hoon, Sue-Il, and Hae-Ryeong.
[1:59:28] <andre11dr> We did get the old version as DLC which everyone played instead because he was super good
[1:59:28] <PhantomMaskJr> Human Banjo
[1:59:43] <$Jhylla81> With all the KoF games I wish Capcom would have done more with their other fighters. Capcom Fighting Jam was a good concept with poor execution
[1:59:53] <jetjagger222> oh god this stage is identical to one in tekken 6
[1:59:56] <andre11dr> Both EX Kyo and Iori were nuts in XIII
[2:00:01] <%Mordexai0> @hoarseplay yeah that sounds about right
[2:00:01] <Who_lio42> shigen?
[2:00:13] <ainda_> thats deeply insulting to shigen lol
[2:00:19] <%ekodrop> is that how you pronounce zweihander in german?
[2:00:31] <andre11dr> Infact every EX caracter was a problem in XIII
[2:00:34] <@Menitta> his head was so small
[2:00:36] <$Jhylla81> I wonder what Last Blade character will be in Samurai Showdown. Im hoping Setsuna
[2:00:41] <Applecannon63> Iori's new super is like his EX neomax from XIII

[2:15:36] <andre11dr> Nah i still don't really care about SFV
[2:15:37] <+0neReeler> ryu trade dp into ultra yeea boy
[2:15:42] <+eanscrale> No one hates fighting games more than the people who play them.
[2:15:50] <PhantomMaskJr> SF4 isn’t 3rd Strike HahaElf SFV isn’t SF4 HahaElf
[2:15:56] <@Menitta> grass is always greener
[2:15:58] <andre11dr> I haven't played SFV in 2 years
[2:15:59] <%ggbhtg> I don't' just hate it, I HATE it
[2:16:03] <%Mordexai0> SFEX3 got tomatoes, and now people realize it's actually GODLIKE
[2:16:12] <$Jhylla81> I liked SF4 but I wish the art style was better
[2:16:24] <Radioactivetaco9> grass is always greener in the older games
[2:16:29] <+0neReeler> sf4 literally revived the genre, props
[2:16:29] <Applecannon63> sfv is okay cause Seth,G,and Gill
[2:16:31] <Hoarseplay> SFEX3 is cool, but I'd rather play Fighter Layer 1.
[2:16:32] <%ekodrop> i went from sf2 to sf4 so it was fine
[2:16:43] <Who_lio42> one more patch pls
[2:16:45] <%Mordexai0> @hoarseplay I like both of them
[2:16:50] <%ggbhtg> Za Wheel of HATE
[2:16:53] <andre11dr> To be fair, launch SFV was fucking wack
[2:16:59] <alphalejandro> People are gonna complain about GG Strive and KOFXV
[2:17:11] <townzzzzz> when's that GG video
[2:17:14] <HolyGriddles> Arcsys making that Dungeon Fighter game. Interested to see what that’s about
[2:17:18] <andre11dr> The beta were better
[2:17:28] <townzzzzz> alright
[2:17:30] <%ggbhtg> @alphalejandro but they already have reason to, because they're dumbed down compared to older games in some way
[2:17:30] <@Menitta> I swear if people say "man KOFXIV was way better than XV" I'm gonna lose it
[2:17:34] <%Mordexai0> @alphalejandro People already complaining about XV because It's not 13
[2:17:39] <Applecannon63> I'm only gonna complain at Kof XV if they don't bring BURNING SHINGO
