[0:01:52] <%livlinn> is this LP part of Dokapon mind game? kyoryuThunk
[0:01:56] <QueequegTheater> It's always cute as someone who grew up in the most corrupt city in the U.S. to see these Montreal boys act like a basic construction racket is the apocalypse
[0:02:07] <%X2Eliah> That's a good point. Just consider that DS1 is nothing compared to Dokapons
[0:02:09] <QueequegTheater> Every city runs that racket
[0:02:22] <Arqartur0> @QueequegTheater DC?
[0:02:27] <QueequegTheater> @Arqartur0 Chicago

[0:02:39] <Solidnick18> i'm okay
[0:02:44] <QueequegTheater> Our mayor literally destroyed an airport and bragged about it on the news
[0:02:45] <%X2Eliah> @QueequegTheater Is Chicago at Detroit levels of "f-ked" yet or not?

[0:03:14] <QueequegTheater> @X2Eliah It's gotten way worse in recent years, people are getting stabbed in the tourist areas too now
[0:03:18] <%joker626> I hope Reggie won't get caught sleeping.
[0:03:31] <andre11dr> I'll never forget, my first time fighting Taurus he jumped of the cliff like a idiot and i was like "wuhh?"
[0:03:40] <%X2Eliah> @QueequegTheater damn. sounds a lot like stockholm and shootouts
[0:03:58] <@Solidus_113> keeping it in place for a long time is the reason I still don't trust liquid cooling
[0:04:01] <Indigo_Automaton> I dread my video card spontaneously failing one day
[0:04:01] <QueequegTheater> @QueequegTheater 50 people get shot every weekend

[0:04:36] <+JaseAdrift> NO
[0:04:37] <%CaptainPileDriver> no, nft is a scam
[0:04:37] <+patriotrenegade> no
[0:04:38] <TheAzureOracle> No, it's all a scam
[0:04:39] <+Jiggisnipe> NO
[0:04:40] <%emMmDeeKay> It's not just you Ethan
[0:04:40] <Treasure_Vault> I will be an old grandpa
[0:04:42] <Deko_> no
[0:04:42] <leith_aziz> What's NFT?
[0:04:46] <+TheFrancix> NO
[0:04:47] <PeterD19> #Can'tWaitForTarkus
[0:04:50] <nabs96> it's literally destroying the environment
[0:04:52] <Solidnick18> what now?
[0:04:54] <+TheFrancix> FUCK NFTS
[0:04:59] <%livlinn> N O
[0:05:02] <leith_aziz> pickyShrug ?
[0:05:02] <%ChoculaUltra> Ubisoft just announced they were getting into the NFT game games too LUL
[0:05:02] <Arqartur0> @CaptainPileDriver It's a scam, that EVERYONE knows is a scam, but it just won't die.
[0:05:03] <%GeneralSCPatton> I can vouch that Artesian will also provide solid troubleshooting if things get wonky. Streaming a poorly optimized early access game fucked all the outputs on my bf's build, and they got us back to a functional state in a few hours.
[0:05:04] <%CaptainPileDriver> there was a half million dollar sale between the seller and himself.
[0:05:06] <Solidnick18> nft's are scams
[0:05:07] <+Jiggisnipe> blockchain is awesome
[0:05:08] <UnlimitedBick> Copywrite continues to be scumlaw
[0:05:10] <+paladinstarbuster> NFTs are scams crypto is not
[0:05:12] <Phantomboss2l> Abt to screenshot nfts
[0:05:12] <+SnorlaxBud> Blockchain is dope
[0:05:18] <%A_German_spy> A_German_spy gifted a Tier 1 sub to Solidus_113! 
[0:05:20] <leith_aziz> I am...confused
[0:05:22] <QueequegTheater> @QueequegTheater Don't forget that time that our mayor literally sent cops to carve giant X's into an airport runway overnight WITHOUT TELLING ABYONE
[0:05:26] <QueequegTheater> *anyone
[0:05:32] <Deko_> it's just done in the worst possible way
[0:05:32] <Treasure_Vault> The blockchain is probably useful for something like tracking
[0:05:35] <%X2Eliah> Adobe is about to put NFT stuff straight into their apps like photoshop etc
[0:05:39] <%livlinn> ay Spy
[0:05:43] <%X2Eliah> like, "export to nft"
[0:05:44] <kikoeru_san> @paladinstarbuster nah man Cryptocurrency is still a scam
[0:05:44] <@Solidus_113> woolieGASM Thanks Spy
[0:05:48] <bear_breaker20> BlockChain as an idea will ERASE the possibility of DEBT Forgiveness
[0:05:49] <%A_German_spy> @livlinn charly23Hi
[0:05:54] <leith_aziz> @WoolieVersus : Woolie for teh sake of being in the loop, what's NFT?
[0:05:57] <%A_German_spy> @Solidus_113 spyServed
[0:06:06] <%A_German_spy> @leith_aziz "Non-Fungible Token"
[0:06:07] <%CappuccinoGuil> Look, I appreciate trying to cut off part of the wood that is rotten, but at some point you gotta see the foundation is fucked and throw it all out.
[0:06:08] <nabs96> crypto and NFTs are a massive scam.
[0:06:13] <+paladinstarbuster> @kikoeru_san The concept is not as woolie just said
[0:06:14] <afronooch> @leith_aziz jpeg x crypto crossover event
[0:06:21] <%Seancicle> FootYellow
[0:06:30] <kikoeru_san> Proof of stake still doesn't solve the issue, people will still mine the same amount
[0:06:31] <shakespearo> JPEGMAFIA vs Crypto Yakuzis
[0:06:34] <astroasis> nabs96 all currency is a scam we're forced to use
[0:06:39] <bear_breaker20> Blockchain makes everyones DEBT Eternally a part of thier Life
[0:06:41] <QueequegTheater> NFTs are a scam built on a scam
[0:06:41] <Xpisirage> Kappa
[0:06:42] <+radegasts> nft's are a nightmare and such a scam
[0:06:44] <+undersea_magic> *bloodborne guy voice*: this world's finished!
[0:06:45] <%CateHecate> selling every single frame of the stream as nfts only 21,000 eth each Kappa
[0:06:48] <+Catpurnicus> NFT is the new AMWAY
[0:06:55] <bear_breaker20> blockchain is gonna backfire so fucking hard its un real
[0:06:58] <kikoeru_san> Proof of Stake won't stop people from running 100 GPUs 24/7
[0:07:00] <brunoberserk> '' NFT was a mistake ''
[0:07:02] <nabs96> @astroasis friendly reminder that we are the only species who pay in order to exist
[0:07:09] <shakespearo> @CateHecate can I preorder reggie's face when he gets smushed by kappa demon?
[0:07:23] <Darren716> Why's there so much noise about nfts now? Haven't they been around for months now
[0:07:34] <%CateHecate> @shakespearo for a small bonus fee of 6,000 extra ethereum, of course
[0:07:37] <trigunstar26> i have no use for a currency i can't physically hold in my wallet
[0:07:42] <+Catpurnicus> normie money finally noticed NFTs
[0:07:44] <%DoctorHam> DoctorHam subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! <3 <3
[0:07:46] <kikoeru_san> @darren716 the scams are ramping up
[0:07:49] <+mechslayer71> oh boy nfts
[0:07:55] <afronooch> a lot of big brands/corps are jumping into the nft train
[0:07:57] <astroasis> nabs96 i know, we've had this crap going for thousands of years. Money and people deciding the 'value' of things is outdated to me
[0:08:05] <%TheBesteban> NF Deez
[0:08:05] <+Talhee> @WoolieVersus NFT's are just the real Dokapon Blood pool. Prove me wrong. Human greed knows no bounds.
[0:08:08] <afronooch> like adobe, rolling stone etc. all within the last coupl weeks
[0:08:15] <+conqab> man, what a scam
[0:08:18] <Dannzzyy> Hey thanks for the lunch break content. Much appreciated.
[0:08:19] <iacus_> I want to see where Woolie goes with this...
[0:08:27] <%DoctorHam> I still can't get over the MLB official cryptocurrency like what the fuck
[0:08:31] <nabs96> @astroasis Unfortunately things won't change until we eradicate capitalism completely and utterly.
[0:08:38] <dashwallkick> it is literally a scam and you can tell because all the art is piss ugly because the art itself is cheap placeholders so they can launder money
[0:08:48] <+Mr_Pylon> it's just a fucking link, it's insane
[0:08:48] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1455421207659139081?t=Np244HCpRXfSBOkB2__Gpw&s=19
[0:08:50] <@Solidus_113> NFTs have ruined pixel art for the time being
[0:08:55] <leith_aziz> From what I understand...you're copyright infringing a 2D/3D creation?
[0:08:56] <%ggbhtg> they put an NFT tag on it?
[0:09:01] <%X2Eliah> Waaait wait.
[0:09:04] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @Catpurnicus
[0:09:08] <Deko_> LUL
[0:09:09] <leith_aziz> Are we talking like art or actual material?
[0:09:11] <%xxMylord> Monkey Company? That's a new one LUL
[0:09:11] <Solidnick18> okay
[0:09:12] <brunoberserk> MONKE
[0:09:14] <%emMmDeeKay> NFTrolls have ruined pixel art pfps
[0:09:15] <+Catpurnicus> its just an IOU
[0:09:24] <%MajorCrasher> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[0:09:24] <%ZeludeRose> why are there so many monkey nfts...
[0:09:33] <%Javaa01> Or if they just run away with the money
[0:09:34] <drunken_lemur> Or just CHOOSE to shut down.
[0:09:40] <Xilef_Retsehc> ntfs remind me of purchasing stars but more hazardous
[0:09:49] <+radegasts> right click + save as is the best way to get your favorite nft
[0:09:50] <+conqab> sick hyperlinks bro
[0:09:51] <Who_lio42> i mean look at what just happened with the Squid Game crypto
[0:09:54] <%FFXIVsFreeTrial> FFXIVsFreeTrial subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! 
[0:09:58] <TigerClaws12> wait it's not a domain? LUL
[0:10:01] <%livlinn> this bit should be archived on YT. Tagged as Education.
[0:10:09] <iacus_> no, the token will still exist in the blockchain even if the thing closes
[0:10:12] <linSP> Never forget space jam dot com
[0:10:14] <%Javaa01> dogfart dot com slash monke
[0:10:15] <iacus_> what gets lost is the asset
[0:10:15] <%vVAstrAVv> how has dark souls got us to blockchain?
[0:10:17] <+Catpurnicus> anyone see that nft bro asking twitter to  disable right click - save?
[0:10:19] <%CodenameChaz> More impressive is that there's so far been *multiple* scams involving NFT makers just taking all the money an fucking off and people are still going "Yeah this is great"
[0:10:19] <shakespearo> Nice shirt, Reggie
[0:10:24] <kikoeru_san> Cryptocurrency are still awful since it bring back the gold standard, moving the measure of value away from work value
[0:10:24] <%DoctorHam> NFTs and cryptocurrency have accomplished one good thing and that's introducing more people to the fact that Money is Fake
[0:10:28] <marcdyllan> also, money is backed by the Government...who backs a NFT?
[0:10:28] <%X2Eliah> Waaait wait wait wait.  So I can Mint an NFT linking to twitch dot tv slash woolieversus??
[0:10:32] <UnlimitedBick> nft every dril tweet

[0:10:43] <iacus_> @marcdyllan Literally Maths
[0:10:44] <trigunstar26> oh damn that IS a nice shirt
[0:10:46] <TheAzureOracle> I'm still reeling over how NFT/crypto scammers are trying to hijack Medabots
[0:10:49] <dashwallkick> @CodenameChaz because all the evangelicals are in on the scam and if they can keep convincing people it's cool then who cares if scams happen
[0:10:50] <%Irridium> It's also killing the environment
[0:10:55] <%emMmDeeKay> @marcdyllan a ponzi scheme
[0:10:56] <Rawbone_saw> hell yea thanks woolie :D
[0:11:00] <kikoeru_san> money is fake, work is the value

[0:11:05] <+TheFrancix> we souls boys now
[0:11:09] <AthenaAegis> All I know that shit is why I can't upgrade my nearly 10 year old pc right now
[0:11:09] <%ZeludeRose> did yall see the cookier clicker guy had to change his icon cuz it looked like an ugly NFT?
[0:11:15] <%X2Eliah> daaah soulz
[0:11:16] <%CateHecate> even so, considering how easily and quickly these things can bottom out into being worthless, it just seems silly to invest in something that is is even more volatile than regular stocks
[0:11:18] <bear_breaker20> blockchain itself is going to be used for so much subjugation and people will cheer for it like star wars
[0:11:19] <%X2Eliah> daaahk*
[0:11:31] <%DoctorHam> Reggie above all else I hope you just have fun with DS1 <3
[0:11:33] <%emMmDeeKay> @ZeludeRose it didn't even look like an ugly NFT, his pixel art had SHADING
[0:11:39] <PeterD19> #Can't Wait For Tarkus
[0:11:43] <iacus_> depends on who you subjugate  I guess
[0:11:48] <sirrice77> thinking about how garyvee super supports nfts despite also saying 98% of them will be bad investments

[0:13:06] <%trigunstar26> @LozsCat Thanks for the gift sub!
[0:13:14] <%mr_sups> Because MONEY
[0:13:15] <%Noonoox12> UBISOFT? RESPECTABLE?
[0:13:16] <bear_breaker20> ubisoft respectable LUL
[0:13:16] <Treasure_Vault> "respectable"
[0:13:17] <%Noonoox12> Hah
[0:13:17] <glass_marcus> Respectable?
[0:13:18] <%GeneralSCPatton> Always room for more woolieLORE
[0:13:18] <%LozsCat> Lore bottomless pit
[0:13:22] <+patriotrenegade> MONEY
[0:13:22] <%CappuccinoGuil> The reason they are jumping is capitalism
[0:13:23] <+Mr_Pylon> LOL respectable Ubisoft
[0:13:25] <NeonBleu> its the new hotness
[0:13:28] <$Holycow8498> Because its a trend that is hot and can make money
[0:13:28] <scrumbotime> Money laundering
[0:13:31] <%Noonoox12> Ubisoft respectfully supported abusers for years at every level of their company lol
[0:13:31] <leith_aziz> WHat was the question again?
[0:13:33] <Solidnick18> Because they are all scumbags
[0:13:33] <+Jiggisnipe> cuz money says Mr. Krabs
[0:13:33] <%Irridium> They started the jump like 5 months ago and it's all only now coming to fruition
[0:13:34] <+EdenOfSecondAccount> Just to be clear, when I said "respectable company" I meant just that they're established
[0:13:35] <%vVAstrAVv> did someone call ubisoft respectable?
[0:13:41] <bear_breaker20> nft's cause power outages in china and iran lol
[0:13:42] <%MajorCrasher> respectable LUL
[0:13:44] <%Noonoox12> establish these nuts ayo
[0:13:45] <%DoctorHam> @Mr_Pylon Thing is that to mainstream audiences, Ubisoft sadly *is* "respectable"
[0:13:46] <leith_aziz> Calm down chat
[0:13:49] <%ggbhtg> Should've said SEGA instead
[0:13:59] <dashwallkick> because they don't know what it is and evangelicals had some drinks with them and pitched them on it so they went "sure!" same thing happened to YA writers with that stupid Realms of Ruin project or w/e
[0:14:01] <iacus_> @bear_breaker20 source?
[0:14:03] <+Jiggisnipe> alright chat stop being obtuse
[0:14:03] <kikoeru_san> it's a new asset class they can integrate into games, also Ubi ain't respectable
[0:14:05] <%MajorCrasher> people think any big companies are respectable LUL LUL LUL
[0:14:07] <afronooch> tbf ubisoft is more respectable than most crypto places. it's not saying much though
[0:14:18] <bear_breaker20> @iacus_ sorry i meant bitcoins*
[0:14:29] <bear_breaker20> and im not looking for the article you can just google that
[0:14:44] <iacus_> can't find anything on it
[0:14:57] <%Prevot> so nft is just blockchain gone corpo
[0:14:59] <%Indigo_Automaton> @LoszCat Thanks!
[0:15:00] <%cache_22> Remember when Ubisoft had that Beyond Good and Evil 2 scheme to crowdsource art for their own game?
[0:15:01] <+extradopeness> i saw a funny sign in front of a mechanic shop that said they "now accept payments in crypto or crawfish."
[0:15:01] <niddron> Brand synergy
[0:15:04] <iacus_> there is an energy crisis in China but I can't see anything linking it to crypto
[0:15:10] <PeterD19> #TarkusHype
[0:15:16] <+Jiggisnipe> we shall integrate nfts into our games - Ubisoft probably
[0:15:19] <%AlteisenReiseZ> they made the mcrib an NFT. life is pain
[0:15:19] <%emMmDeeKay> Ubisoft to now openly and directly support Money Laundering and Rug Pull Scams instead of doing it on the down low like proper companies.
[0:15:20] <+Deekman> I feel like I've been using MyUbisoft points for like 10 years
[0:15:22] <QueequegTheater> The thing is, fiat currency is literally backed by the U.S. governmnet.  There are zero assurances to keep your money safe behind crypto.
[0:15:37] <%Seancicle> merci pour recul
[0:15:45] <%X2Eliah> Crypto is backed by the collective greed of everyone invested in crypto
[0:16:01] <+paladinstarbuster> @iacus_ diddnt they just ban the mining of it there
[0:16:01] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:16:03] <bear_breaker20> @iacus_ ill whisper
[0:16:04] <kikoeru_san> @queequegtheater and THAT is why it's ALL a scam
[0:16:06] <%illtima> Elijah Wood selling an NFT drawn by a white supremacist sure something that happened JUST LAST WEEK

[0:16:38] <%robosqueeb> oh ew
[0:16:47] <+paladinstarbuster> @illtima Did he endorse the person or just the art?
[0:16:51] <%CodenameChaz> Apparently the company Ubisoft is partnering with is involved with *multiple* NFT and crypto game scams, where they make their own currency that can only be used in their games, and quietly sunset and replace them when interest starts cooling down
[0:16:54] <QueequegTheater> !motivated
[0:17:05] <%trigunstar26> bruh i'm just here for the souls journey
[0:17:08] <leith_aziz> Wow, this NFT thing seems awful by chat's reaction, meanwhile I understand very little about NFT or crypto
[0:17:12] <%specters_art88> NFTs are actually minted to on the blockchain. You can have unlockables that are just links to external content or physical Art as well. And ethereum 2.0 is just around the corner that will move to proof of stake which is way more energy efficient.
[0:17:12] <+EdenOfSecondAccount> Thanks woolie
[0:17:13] <+extradopeness> but overall its bigly f'd up that corps are in on it now
[0:17:15] <iacus_> ouch
[0:17:19] <TheAzureOracle> Reggie VS NFTs
[0:17:26] <%X2Eliah> The very scary thing is that all these crazy high value nft trades and sales etc show that somehow, a lot of people have insane amounts of free money

[0:19:05] <user_naim> Operated with an app
[0:19:09] <+Deekman> @WoolieVersus it was a juicer that would only let you use it if you bought a subscription and their proprietary juice boxes
[0:19:09] <%ggbhtg> you could've just....MADE A juicer that was GOOD
[0:19:10] <afronooch> @robosqueeb did... did it juice?
[0:19:12] <%ggbhtg> but naw
[0:19:13] <%livlinn> brendaWhiteyoda
[0:19:17] <+Jiggisnipe> it totally solved a non-problem Kappa
[0:19:19] <linSP> it was SO BAD, you had to buy JUICE PACKS and put them in the MACHINE TO SQUEEZE
[0:19:20] <%ozzrabbit> Christ this snuck up on me
[0:19:21] <leith_aziz> @slix3431 Vantge creeps into Reggie's Society
[0:19:25] <%specters_art88> @x2eliah depends on the site which they support and you can select between them but the main one is ethereum. Also you can mint them over to different blockchains if you want to pay the minting costs.
[0:19:25] <%ggbhtg> like, why not make a juicer that actually WORKS?
[0:19:26] <%cache_22> Y'all got any more of that humanity?
[0:19:29] <%robosqueeb> @afronooch it made like an onion concentrate very intense
[0:19:29] <%Pillagius> Have you seen yet the fan-made Silent Hill short movie ?
[0:19:29] <%GeneralSCPatton> The only neat feature is that it could have known about product recalls and refused to squeeze
[0:19:31] <leith_aziz> *Vantage
[0:19:33] <+Catpurnicus> its was supposed to be a keureg but for juice
[0:19:35] <%trigunstar26> Zuckerburg is a hollow
[0:19:41] <%robosqueeb> i had to drink it i lost a bet
[0:19:41] <%trigunstar26> lmao
[0:19:59] <afronooch> @robosqueeb oh no
[0:20:04] <iacus_> taht juicer is a fascinating story. If you were the industrial designer working on that you basically get a dreap project to test your cool ideal all bankrolled by a millionaire that doesn't know better
[0:20:12] <%X2Eliah> @specters_art88 But minting to ethereum, doesn't that incur the relatively high "transaction cost" that eth has nowadays?
[0:20:26] <@Solidus_113> Verbr

[0:26:37] <%Lion_kun> Poise was systematically decimated in games after ds1
[0:26:40] <RickyRelucent> near forest entrance
[0:26:43] <Deko_> hidden numbers NotLikeThis
[0:26:50] <+Deekman> Explaining this to him right now seems pointless without being able to put it to any physical use
[0:26:52] <andre11dr> Wolf ring also helps it
[0:26:59] <%ken_kuma> ken_kuma subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! Let's fuckin go
[0:26:59] <%hax_metatron> DS1 Poise makes it my favorite FromSoft game. I want MORE SLOW CHUNKY ACTION GAMES DAMN IT
[0:27:00] <%robosqueeb> i hope elden ring has good poise
[0:27:02] <RickyRelucent> wolf is 30 poise right chet?
[0:27:03] <BigYanno> he doesn't have enough equipment to worry about poise right now
[0:27:06] <%Lion_kun> You want poise in Ds3? Use some MP every 5 seconds.
[0:27:06] <velgaduere> housekeeping complete
[0:27:07] <%A_German_spy> @RickyRelucent 40
[0:27:07] <emptyantics> POISE GANG
[0:27:09] <primaryfire> 40 @RickyRelucent
[0:27:10] <velgaduere> or not
[0:27:18] <RickyRelucent> 40?! got dang better then i remember
[0:27:18] <vivaciouseff> @RickyRelucent wolf adds 40 iirc
[0:27:21] <%ken_kuma> Hello, everybody. How's the stream goin'?
[0:27:22] <+Deekman> I hope elden ring is a more methodical journey like DS and DeS
[0:27:26] <andre11dr> I forget the exact number on the wolf ring ,but it a lot
[0:27:27] <RickyRelucent> u can tank a whole zweihander hit with that
[0:27:31] <RickyRelucent> amazing
[0:27:41] <%Seancicle> üò∂üí≠üè∞
[0:27:45] <plaguedoctor_vi> Just think about Metal Zangief
[0:27:48] <RickyRelucent> 335 per hit on zweis bois
[0:27:52] <plaguedoctor_vi> when you talk about poise
[0:27:57] <MrMatternot> Gonna be a long time before Alvinia
[0:28:00] <glass_marcus> I never take on the undead burg doggos without the wolf ring
[0:28:01] <RickyRelucent> 70 poise wil stunlock u at 2hits
[0:28:03] <BigYanno> All I can say is don't worry about it
[0:28:05] <RickyRelucent> unless 71 poise
[0:28:07] <RickyRelucent> then is fine
[0:28:10] <andre11dr> Like the wolf ring will let you face fuck attacks just with pants on
[0:28:12] <RickyRelucent> wont be stunned
[0:28:14] <Johannen> Not a lot of those in DS i think compared to other games
[0:28:24] <+extradopeness> YES OR NO MF
[0:28:30] <Xaeveax> I'm rewatching the original Dark Souls II playthrough and I must say, Woolie is a MUCH better coach than Pat was back then.
[0:28:31] <MrMatternot> So, that fire keeper soul....
[0:28:34] <%Lion_kun> Poise does not exist in Bloodborne, Sekiro or even DS2
[0:28:38] <Treasure_Vault> Buy a key
[0:28:38] <Darren716> Man I fucked that up on my recent play through, I didn't know grabbing the Blighttown fire keepers soul just killed the fire link shrine maiden
[0:28:41] <RickyRelucent> BOI LET ME TELL U
[0:28:46] <RickyRelucent> this game is anus
[0:28:53] <Darren716> And I've played DS like 9 times
[0:28:53] <%Noonoox12> @Lion_kun poise is totally in DS2, did u mean DS3?
[0:28:58] <+RemedyofRevenge> this game has its own Yurt the Silent Chief
[0:29:00] <%Lion_kun> From in its infinite wisdom chose to eliminate it.
[0:29:04] <MrMatternot> Your first invisible wall isn't untill Blighttown
[0:29:05] <%Lion_kun> Yes I meant 3
[0:29:05] <+Jiggisnipe> be vague like player/dev message Kappa
[0:29:12] <Treasure_Vault> Go kill that black knight, maybe? A drop would be sick.
[0:29:13] <BigYanno> give them to bonfire chan
[0:29:14] <RickyRelucent> last stream i found out 28% beat a midgame boss
[0:29:17] <%Juriasu> sliding down that ladder still makes me nervous
[0:29:20] <PeterD19> TarkusHype
[0:29:21] <RickyRelucent> form pat and woolz
[0:29:22] <%Lion_kun> Well it was nerfed in 3.
[0:29:25] <glass_marcus> theres one in the forest
[0:29:26] <%hax_metatron> @Darren716 That was debunked. It's just coming back up after going through certain areas / killing bosses / clearing certain flags.
[0:29:30] <RickyRelucent> on steam
[0:29:32] <+cdrom321> @darren716 What? No way it does that.
[0:29:38] <Darren716> Yup
[0:29:59] <Darren716> I master keyed down to blight so I could get green titanite and the sealer gear
[0:30:01] <%X2Eliah> @RickyRelucent Game completion stats (usually you can see that from global cheevo stats) are globally wild like that. Most ppl dont finish or even get halfway through games
[0:30:01] <RickyRelucent> cant wait for reggie to found out about chain backstabs and ringswapping
[0:30:06] <+extradopeness> rise sir reggarth
[0:30:06] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:30:14] <Solidnick18> good stuff
[0:30:15] <Darren716> Grabbed the soul, climbed up, and she was dead before I rang wither bell
[0:30:23] <RickyRelucent> Its like competittive @X2Eliah
[0:30:29] <RickyRelucent> only like 10% plays the game that hard
[0:30:29] <MightyOwl95> Unless I missed it last time, don't forget to tell Reggie to take off his in-game shirt to get a look at the darksign on his chest
[0:30:29] <%X2Eliah> Hey as long as you dont lose life in trade, its all good
[0:30:31] <Kekama> I remember spending hours just farming these guys to buy out the store my first time here
[0:30:32] <%Ensign_Epic> Most folks aren't gonna try for chainstabs & ringswaps
[0:30:32] <RickyRelucent> to go for ng+7
[0:30:33] <BigYanno> until he gets some better gear the only real options are slow and sure or benny hill mr mcgoo his way past everything
[0:30:37] <RickyRelucent> on a single char, or more
[0:30:42] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[0:30:47] <%robosqueeb> drop that shield perfect

[0:30:55] <RickyRelucent> DROP SHIELD FOR STA REGEN
[0:31:00] <RickyRelucent> constantly
[0:31:02] <Treasure_Vault> Reggie must return to neutral for the fronstab from shield knockaway.
[0:31:03] <leith_aziz> Gonna see if chat has a moment
[0:31:05] <lukewarm_luke> You know what I mean?
[0:31:10] <RickyRelucent> YO

[0:31:50] <BigYanno> murder is always an option

[0:32:09] <brunoberserk> the barrel is his WAIFU
[0:32:10] <%Juriasu> hey, that barrel is his waifu
[0:32:11] <%UnbreakableDoof> I'm betting 5 gift subs that Reggie will make a non-gimmick boss look free as fuck at some point this playthrough. I believe in Reggarth

[0:32:44] <KyberNasse> Stone cold
[0:32:45] <Treasure_Vault> Those three are all worth it.
[0:32:47] <masterafaster> Reggarth, destroyer of love
[0:32:49] <MrMatternot> He will have new talk options by the time you come back.
[0:32:54] <WakeUpThrow> Reggie's an invader in the making lmao
[0:32:55] <%X2Eliah> keys are always good, right?
[0:32:56] <DXLelouch24> @WoolieVersus Yulia is the Uchi
[0:32:59] <Rawbone_saw> heater shield squad, SOUND OFF
[0:33:00] <andre11dr> I think he's talking to him imaginary cat
[0:33:00] <%CaptainPileDriver> go to the key items
[0:33:11] <%GeneralSCPatton> HEATER SHIELD! psaDab
[0:33:11] <%CaptainPileDriver> you NEED those fucking things
[0:33:14] <BigYanno> bottomless box is nice especially later on when you have a billion weapons and you only use 2
[0:33:23] <%ken_kuma> Reggarth The Unforgiving Flame
[0:33:23] <%Ensign_Epic> Nah, it's 100% the uchigatana. He talks to it when he draws it on you
[0:33:32] <RickyRelucent> Bottomless box kinda useless
[0:33:37] <@Solidus_113> Finger also allows a 3rd coop partner
[0:33:37] <RickyRelucent> unless, u like ringswapping
[0:33:39] <WakeUpThrow> It's the sword afaik
[0:33:40] <QueequegTheater> It might be the sword
[0:33:40] <%Ensign_Epic> No it's not ricky lol
[0:33:41] <leith_aziz> Seems like a dead dog
[0:33:41] <RickyRelucent> world of difference then
[0:33:44] <Kekama> Yes
[0:33:47] <%X2Eliah> is it the swagsword?
[0:33:49] <Rawbone_saw> it seems like he's petting something that would be in or on the barrel
[0:33:51] <QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus It could be an animal in the barrel
[0:33:52] <+patriotrenegade> Sword, imaginary pet, barrel, whatever
[0:33:53] <andre11dr> I think it's a imaginary cat in his barrel
[0:33:54] <%CaptainPileDriver> @RickyRelucent when you pick up a shit ton of weapons, gear, and items you don't need
[0:33:58] <RickyRelucent> kinda nice to tidy up the inventoryy
[0:34:01] <RickyRelucent> but lower prio
[0:34:02] <teh_Question> it's 100000% his pointy thingie
[0:34:02] <%Ensign_Epic> Bottomless barrel's stupid useful is DSR, duping ssorta needs it
[0:34:03] <%BallerSwagBro9k> EVERYTHING?
[0:34:04] <RickyRelucent> for me, ppersonally
[0:34:09] <+Deekman> i am not going to debate that it's actually the barrel
[0:34:11] <GeoGio3> Yulia is the real name of Velia who knows
[0:34:15] <Kalcom> agree to disagree
[0:34:15] <nabs96> its tha sword
[0:34:16] <+Catpurnicus> thats a fat roll set right now
[0:34:17] <GeoGio3> Velka
[0:34:19] <MrMatternot> Yulia = Moss lady?
[0:34:20] <andre11dr> I hate the chain set
[0:34:20] <teh_Question> it's velka
[0:34:24] <RickyRelucent> @Kalcom nodders
[0:34:25] <BanHero> he does yulia is "plump" i thought, doubt you can say that to describe a sword
[0:34:26] <+McSoliace> weight
[0:34:29] <%Noonoox12> ugh I hate that set it's so ugly
[0:34:29] <QueequegTheater> @teh_Question prove it
[0:34:31] <@Solidus_113> weight tho
[0:34:33] <+Catpurnicus> woolie let him know about weight
[0:34:34] <mikesapartment> is heavy. i'd pass on it
[0:34:34] <xXVeggiePLusXx> Mommy Yulia
[0:34:34] <%Ensign_Epic> Yulia is the sword, he talks to the uchigatana as he draws it
[0:34:34] <Grunkle_Dan_> Yulia is Gwyns stage name
[0:34:35] <RickyRelucent> all roads something something rome
[0:34:40] <%X2Eliah> thats true, the sowrd is not plump
[0:34:51] <andre11dr> I never see anyone playing with the chain set too
[0:34:51] <KyberNasse> Heater Shield more like Neater Shield
[0:34:53] <+Jiggisnipe> it's probably something that use to stay in the barrel that most likely died and he's too insane to realize it. But saying it's the barrel is also cool
[0:34:59] <MrMatternot> Grab a shortbow
[0:35:11] <BigYanno> chain armor is so ugly. Fashion souls is important
[0:35:21] <RickyRelucent> @MrMatternot yes, blight town might be less stressthis way.
[0:35:22] <MrMatternot> You can't aim the crossbow
[0:35:28] <%Fefe41> Fefe41 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! From watching Woolie bumble his way through the Souls series to now seeing him guiding Reggie...this is the character development we all needed. Good luck and have fun gentlemen.
[0:35:29] <+meermadon> chain set in DS3 looks good
[0:35:32] <RickyRelucent> did reggie pick up the thief key?
[0:35:35] <teh_Question> @QueequegTheater in the game's original Aramaic, Yulia is swapped for Velka PogChamp
[0:35:40] <RickyRelucent> kinda wanna see him suffer in upper blight town
[0:35:44] <andre11dr> Chain set looks so wack
[0:35:48] <RickyRelucent> an experience everyy dark souls player must have, atleast once
[0:35:55] <nxflre> Club is pretty good
[0:35:56] <hookhis> he got the ring
[0:36:00] <andre11dr> And it's not even that much defense
[0:36:12] <GilliamYaeger> @RickyRelucent Nope. Old Witch Ring.
[0:36:16] <MrMatternot> There is no decent bow for a long time
[0:36:18] <RickyRelucent> DOPE
[0:36:23] <andre11dr> Should he grab the boxes?
[0:36:26] <RickyRelucent> my fiar lady~
[0:36:35] <plaguedoctor_vi> i think you can also hit people with the binocular
[0:36:35] <QueequegTheater> @teh_Question that's on the level of "Lucatiel was originally a Don Quixote reference". Weak.
[0:36:39] <Crownaux0> did he take out the black knight last time or just run past to get the blue tearstone ring?
[0:36:47] <+ORGkash> that is a Y, woolie
[0:36:51] <MrMatternot> Boxes won't really be needed until he comes back through the shortcut
[0:36:51] <plaguedoctor_vi> and here on darksouls 1 it a iten
[0:36:53] <GeoGio3> He fell on the ring and got killed
[0:36:53] <%Noonoox12> @Crownaux0 he rolled onto the ring and then instantly died
[0:36:55] <andre11dr> @crownaux0 He ran
[0:36:55] <BigYanno> pretty much all the starting gear is good
[0:36:56] <Basic_Birch_> Woolie with the not moving lips again
[0:37:03] <Crownaux0> lol
[0:37:04] <NumbF4ke> Did the residence key open the door for the rock? I don't remember
[0:37:04] <JetpackMcQuack> this is what we learned fractions for
[0:37:08] <nxflre> @MrMatternot he actually fell off the firebomb bridgee toi get the item lol
[0:37:08] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1455421207659139081?t=Np244HCpRXfSBOkB2__Gpw&s=19
[0:37:17] <%Ensign_Epic> this is why we use Soulsplanner
[0:37:18] <%Juriasu> mid roll is fiiiiiiiiiiine
[0:37:19] <%CaptainPileDriver> a middle roll/fat roll are both fine
[0:37:20] <RickyRelucent> couldve gotten red tearstone if he had thief key, ,he'll have to go to the grass crest black knight to go around to dragon canyon
[0:37:20] <%X2Eliah> eff it go chub roll
[0:37:29] <QueequegTheater> 13.3 not 13.5 Woolie
[0:37:36] <chancho4tierra> middlle roll is not that bad
[0:37:37] <BigYanno> the worst thing about playing DS1 is needing to use a calculator to keep yourself under 25%
[0:37:43] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's fine, chubby roll still really solid
[0:37:44] <RickyRelucent> blue + red tearstone is one of my fave combinations
[0:37:45] <JetpackMcQuack> that's the spirit
[0:37:46] <MrMatternot> Did he take the thief key?
[0:37:47] <%Juriasu> the confidence!
[0:37:48] <andre11dr> Fuck it go full tank
[0:37:50] <zzNamttamzz> We noisy heavy bois now
[0:37:50] <sendart> lol those gloves suck
[0:37:53] <%Ensign_Epic> Midroll is fine yeh, fastroll is only really stupid important for PvP
[0:37:54] <velgaduere> Woolie looks directly into the camera.
[0:37:56] <RickyRelucent> kinda ring intensive, but neat
[0:37:57] <%CaptainPileDriver> chubby BOI REGGARTH
[0:37:57] <%X2Eliah> surely they could have colour coded those weight margins
[0:38:05] <+Catpurnicus> the arms are exactly the same def
[0:38:13] <RickyRelucent> thats fine
[0:38:16] <RickyRelucent> he'll tonk hits now
[0:38:19] <teh_Question> jingle jingle jingle
[0:38:20] <GeoGio3> Love the sounds the armors make
[0:38:21] <%illtima> Chain boi
[0:38:22] <velgaduere> you're gonna carry that weight, Reggarth
[0:38:23] <QueequegTheater> Reggie Steiner
[0:38:24] <+extradopeness> rolling? more like rolling *my eyes* at this sophomoric gameplay
[0:38:24] <%X2Eliah> Reggie looks like a discount silver surfer now
[0:38:25] <RickyRelucent> might want a big weapn rn
[0:38:28] <+HelloImTom08> Thicc boi roll
[0:38:28] <RickyRelucent> dunno

[0:38:29] <%Noonoox12> uuuuuugh I hate it
[0:38:33] <%Ensign_Epic> Forgot how loud that shit is lol
[0:38:33] <Xaeveax> That helm is always nightmare fuel to me
[0:38:45] <leith_aziz> I roll with it
[0:38:48] <andre11dr> no it doesn't
[0:38:49] <RickyRelucent> ehhhh
[0:38:49] <BigYanno> don't worry, I'm sure he'll find something more fashionable soon
[0:38:49] <derap41> oh almost missed it
[0:38:49] <kikosmore> @Noonoox12 i instantly regretted buying it on my first playthrough lol
[0:38:50] <RickyRelucent> not needed
[0:38:51] <QueequegTheater> CLANK CLANK CLANK
[0:38:57] <RickyRelucent> unless u plan on hucking spells

[0:39:13] <+extradopeness> no AC but the HEATER work
[0:39:17] <Kekama> His death
[0:39:19] <derap41> Yulia
[0:39:19] <%CaptainPileDriver> the best armor in the game is still tarkus's because unlike most named sets you can upgrade his and when it's fully upgraded nothing beats it in defense
[0:39:23] <RickyRelucent> some nice dialogue u can get when certain ppl go there at the same time
[0:39:35] <RickyRelucent> patches even has unused lines talking shit about laurtrec and shiva
[0:39:35] <MrMatternot> Grab the bow + arrows
[0:39:35] <velgaduere> @RickyRelucent the good thing about this playthrough is that there are no plans hotsamHUNT
[0:39:50] <GeoGio3> I‚Äôm hype to see Reggie evolve his fashion souls through the game
[0:39:52] <andre11dr> Man this the first time Ive seen this set in a long time, nobody wears this shit LUL
[0:39:52] <RickyRelucent> shouldn't be any beyond stats
[0:40:00] <+JustToWatch> a bottomless box, a bottomless sea. Accepting of all that there is can be
[0:40:05] <RickyRelucent> best way is to fumble urself into stuff
[0:40:06] <teh_Question> heater shield is the best for the early game imo
[0:40:10] <%hax_metatron> CHONK CHAIN ARMOR
[0:40:14] <+extradopeness> man looking like captain Eo
[0:40:20] <QueequegTheater> Reggie VS UI Design
[0:40:21] <Xaeveax> By the wrath of Mother Kos...
[0:40:27] <+Deekman> I can't believe they made it so you can pop multiple at once
[0:40:31] <QueequegTheater> Let him go human Woolie
[0:40:36] <+pupil31> monkaS chill reggie
[0:40:38] <%ken_kuma> Do it, Reggie....
[0:40:38] <BigYanno> that was a chat member. they tried to wave
[0:40:43] <%Shadow_Yomi> It's Old Greg!
[0:40:44] <sendart> Blood for the Blood god
[0:40:46] <andre11dr> @deekman I can't, thank god
[0:40:46] <GeoGio3> Reggie is out for blood
[0:40:47] <Deko_> yeah i got used to pop them 1 by 1
[0:40:48] <drunken_lemur> Reggie has the bloodlust!
[0:40:48] <+HelloImTom08> Do it lol
[0:40:49] <+Jiggisnipe> Reggarth with the murderous intent
[0:40:49] <Solidnick18> calm down man
[0:40:50] <teh_Question> aw yiss
[0:40:58] <QueequegTheater> If you kill him you get everything that's unique to him Kappa
[0:41:06] <andre11dr> Yes you have
[0:41:09] <%ken_kuma> Give in to the blood lust, Reggarth
[0:41:11] <+Deekman> @andre11dr right?! I still have flashbacks to popping 30 humanity the long way lol
[0:41:14] <RickyRelucent> dont kill, uchi is buyable from shiva once he moves to blight town.
[0:41:15] <GeoGio3> Look he is a cool little weird dude, no need for violence
[0:41:18] <velgaduere> a Darkwraith in the making
[0:41:18] <%ken_kuma> Pretend he's Dokapon...
[0:41:26] <%hax_metatron> Game's calling you a hoarder Reggie
[0:41:30] <leith_aziz> This might be a bit random, but I'd like chat's thoughts on this if you have a moment.
[0:41:34] <RickyRelucent> basically, join forest, he spawns, u talk, u move to blight town
[0:41:39] <%Ensign_Epic> shiva of the east more like shiva's now deceased amirite folks
[0:41:41] <RickyRelucent> gotta be in the covenant tho.
[0:41:43] <Treasure_Vault> Imagine a chest mimic finding a bottomless box.
[0:41:46] <teh_Question> blood for the blood god reggie
[0:41:52] <%ken_kuma> @leith_aziz Hit me
[0:41:53] <andre11dr> @deekman As much of a downgrade as DS2 waa ,at least it added that
[0:42:03] <ray9k9> Woolie with that FORESHADOWING.
[0:42:03] <leith_aziz> Guys, do you feel the need of content creators or people you watch to validate something you're into to feel like you can like it? Because I usually dont consider "guilty pleasures" and try to think of stuff I like as objectively good, but I think im making it worse on myself thinking like that. If they go "this thing sucks" it breaks my mindset.
[0:42:29] <deviljhojho_> @leith_aziz the only opinion that matters in the entire universe is your own
[0:42:31] <MrMatternot> get used to that chainmail noise...
[0:42:31] <%Noonoox12> @leith_aziz nothing is objectively good. It's all up to personal taste
[0:42:32] <deviljhojho_> never back down
[0:42:32] <teh_Question> sleigh bells boi
[0:42:45] <%X2Eliah> I hope Reggie doesn't forget to save his game
[0:42:49] <Treasure_Vault> DA KNIGHT
[0:42:51] <%Noonoox12> I, personally, think that every menu-based rpg ever made (from final fantasy to undertale) is complete trash
[0:42:54] <%Irridium> @leith_aziz I don't personally. I like what I like. It's nice if others do too but if they don't? Eh, whatever.
[0:42:54] <deviljhojho_> besides, something being "bad" doesnt mean it cant be enjoyable. I love the giant claw
[0:42:54] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[0:43:00] <RickyRelucent> he can drop shit
[0:43:01] <MrMatternot> There is a locked door behind the bomb thrower
[0:43:01] <%ken_kuma> @leith_aziz Content creators have gotten me into things like Woolie, but regardless of what they got me into I myself validate to myself what I like.
[0:43:02] <slix3431> You failed into treasure
[0:43:04] <RickyRelucent> black knight shit
[0:43:04] <Solidnick18> big boy souls
[0:43:07] <BigYanno> realboy McLearn2Parry
[0:43:08] <RickyRelucent> titanite
[0:43:09] <Treasure_Vault> Sometimes real boi drops real stuph
[0:43:13] <%CaptainPileDriver> i mean, pat is on record as hating nier music even though it's good
[0:43:15] <+dalmek> @leith_aziz I view content creators as just like, some dude so if they aren't a fan I'm mostly whatever (but if they bring up interesting points I like thinking about that)
[0:43:21] <andre11dr> Ehhhh ,I'd argue some stuff is objectively bad tho LUL
[0:43:25] <%Noonoox12> Pop a humanity for +40% drop rate
[0:43:27] <teh_Question> or if your name is Woolie
[0:43:28] <BigYanno> BurnedBoy McGitGud LUL
[0:43:28] <slix3431> Real Boi was guarding that ring Reggie. You Existentially defeated him
[0:43:29] <Solidnick18> that as well
[0:43:30] <%ken_kuma> @dalmek Exactly
[0:43:32] <RickyRelucent> humanity, a ring, or soft humanity
[0:43:33] <available_line> Very rare, but very real.
[0:43:35] <%Ensign_Epic> @leith_aziz not every content creator is a good judge on every (or any) piece of content; depends on who is saying about what
[0:43:35] <RickyRelucent> help with droprate
[0:43:36] <%CaptainPileDriver> YEYEYE FIGHT THE BIG BOI
[0:43:40] <Crownaux0> @leith_aziz If you trust their opinions that's one thing, but you shouldn't let content creators and influencers dissuade you from something you otherwise would've liked
[0:43:42] <RickyRelucent> u gain  soft humanity if u kill enough enemies
[0:43:45] <RickyRelucent> withut dying
[0:43:48] <%Juriasu> I got the ultra greatsword from them last playthrough, fun to use
[0:43:48] <Darren716> Woolie wrong doors
[0:43:51] <+RemedyofRevenge> if Reggie gets a black knight weapon he's gonna ROLL this game lol
[0:43:57] <Treasure_Vault> There's also door above the knight
[0:43:58] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> oh shit hell yeah REGGIE SOULS
[0:44:03] <%ken_kuma> Like I enjoy these guys, but I don't know them
[0:44:08] <andre11dr> @remedyofrevenge Not really tho
[0:44:09] <%CaptainPileDriver> if he's really lucky reggie will get the black knight shield
[0:44:09] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:44:09] <%X2Eliah> Xplor
[0:44:14] <Slim_Lipid> why does that chain mail look moldy
[0:44:16] <%X2Eliah> Reggie is in big Xplor mode
[0:44:20] <Treasure_Vault> Door above the Black Knight?
[0:44:21] <%Noonoox12> @Slim_Lipid it is
[0:44:25] <astroasis> !MOTIVATED
[0:44:25] <@Moobot> @astroasis 2347 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[0:44:26] <+patriotrenegade> I dont think the tower door is unlocked by the residence key. There is a chest by the Black Knight that can now be accessed tho
[0:44:27] <Johannen> I think its just that one door...right?
[0:44:27] <%CaptainPileDriver> moldy armor reggarth
[0:44:28] <MrMatternot> Head towards bomb throwers
[0:44:30] <Darren716> He can't go down yet with his keys
[0:44:34] <leith_aziz> @andre11dr Well, once you try to think of it like that, things stop making sense (when it comes to fiction at least). We can all agree that Twilight sucks, so I guess that's something.
[0:44:39] <Darren716> He can get sparks tho
[0:44:50] <Basic_Birch_> residence key opens the door near black knight
[0:44:50] <Treasure_Vault> There's a door on the way to real boy too!
[0:44:55] <%CaptainPileDriver> this is moldy armor
[0:44:58] <KyberNasse> The rustlords
[0:45:08] <+tuchpi> just joined, i like the hogan outfit
[0:45:08] <MrMatternot> door above black night

[0:45:22] <deviljhojho_> hey
[0:45:22] <RickyRelucent> reggarth looks ppimp u take that back
[0:45:27] <Rawbone_saw> nice job
[0:45:33] <+patriotrenegade> oh that jumping attack habit is gonna bite him
[0:45:37] <+extradopeness> the leap
[0:45:51] <RickyRelucent> jumping attack habit and cant kick to unshield enemies
[0:45:54] <RickyRelucent> smh
[0:45:58] <rekseee> are they switching or just full Reggie playthrough?
[0:46:01] <RickyRelucent> payoB
[0:46:05] <+extradopeness> where the parries
[0:46:08] <Solidnick18> strafing is prettty goood
[0:46:12] <QueequegTheater> HE CAME
[0:46:16] <Zomner> lost NNN
[0:46:16] <MrMatternot> Reggie may prefer double handing over shield
[0:46:16] <%Noonoox12> @rekseee full reggie, see: demon's souls
[0:46:18] <%CappuccinoGuil> @RickyRelucent he's wearing armor literally described as being worn by common soldiers, I ain't knocking his practicality, that shit will keep you alive.
[0:46:19] <%xxMylord> @rekseee reggie al the way
[0:46:26] <rekseee> word
[0:46:30] <graemecrackers2> spin to win
[0:46:31] <+Deekman> @WoolieVersus why not give 2 handing a chance Reggie seems to like circle strafing and dodging anyway
[0:46:33] <+paladinstarbuster> this is the best time to learn parrying
[0:46:34] <Rawbone_saw> heater shield doing WORK
[0:46:35] <%CaptainPileDriver> this armor is practial...ly MOLDY

[0:46:46] <RickyRelucent> wait, wut
[0:46:50] <RickyRelucent> did i miss something
[0:46:55] <Xaeveax> He is gonna send himself off a cliff with that jump
[0:46:58] <Rawbone_saw> @BigYanno NO and infact he jsut had two really good blocking moments
[0:46:58] <ray9k9> nice spacing Reggie
[0:46:59] <%X2Eliah> @BigYanno not verbatim, but he has hinted at it
[0:47:00] <RickyRelucent> oh right, probably
[0:47:01] <Treasure_Vault> Locked door right here will open.
[0:47:02] <QueequegTheater> hitboxes psaUp
[0:47:02] <+ItsSansom> PERFECT
[0:47:04] <leith_aziz> @Crownaux0 I like that answer. Thanks for sharing your thoughts. I should let my own opinion be what influences the most. pickyFive1 pickyFive2
[0:47:07] <Johannen> PERFECT
[0:47:08] <+patriotrenegade> PERFECT
[0:47:09] <%Noonoox12> @Deekman Rman mainly 2-handed during demon's souls. Dark Souls 1 is a lot slower paced and that defence is a much more useful option
[0:47:10] <+robertoszek> P E R F E C T
[0:47:14] <leith_aziz> Nice
[0:47:15] <%cache_22> Thanks iFrames
[0:47:15] <LunarRemix> Now you're playing Dark Souls
[0:47:19] <BigYanno> congrats, you beat dark souls
[0:47:19] <RickyRelucent> twohanded backstabs do more dmg
[0:47:20] <%CaptainPileDriver> he's learning the drift
[0:47:22] <+robertoszek> it just rolls out the tongue
[0:47:26] <%CateHecate> Drop your shield! Yknow what I mean? Perfect
[0:47:26] <RickyRelucent> u can even do a twohanded parry
[0:47:27] <+pupil31> he's gaming now
[0:47:28] <drunken_lemur> Which session is this? 2 or 3?
[0:47:28] <primaryfire> they got rid of those iframes in ds2 :)
[0:47:29] <QueequegTheater> Like 150 iframes
[0:47:30] <Solidnick18> aye we home
[0:47:30] <+Deekman> @Noonoox12 while I agree he's not using it anyway
[0:47:31] <RickyRelucent> if u wanna chance it
[0:47:34] <Rionxgarland> is woolie or reggie playing
[0:47:35] <+RemedyofRevenge> r e s i n

[0:47:46] <MrMatternot> Hash resin
[0:47:47] <RickyRelucent> EZmode taurus demon
[0:47:49] <Vigogs> highly resinous
[0:47:49] <%ken_kuma> @drunken_lemur 2
[0:47:49] <Rionxgarland> thanks
[0:47:51] <%Juriasu> MY BIURNING AXE
[0:47:52] <deviljhojho_> makes me think
[0:47:55] <%CateHecate> we're broke so we're scraping resin
[0:47:56] <QueequegTheater> @primaryfire It's equivalent exchange for 2 having *way* cooler weapon animations overall
[0:47:56] <andre11dr> He learned
[0:47:57] <+askalta> set your axe on THUNDER
[0:48:05] <andre11dr> Now the game is over
[0:48:11] <RickyRelucent> swag moves
[0:48:13] <Solidnick18> das boot
[0:48:13] <RickyRelucent> looked grand
[0:48:18] <RickyRelucent> :3
[0:48:20] <deviljhojho_> if it works it works
[0:48:21] <Rionxgarland> reggie souls
[0:48:23] <+extradopeness> resin scraping cuz the weed man in jail
[0:48:25] <Xaeveax> I hope the boot comes back in Elden Ring
[0:48:29] <+robertoszek> everytime? everytime
[0:48:31] <leith_aziz> Thanks for responding to my question, chat. It might mean little, but I appreciate your help. It means a lot pickyLove pickyEZ
[0:48:32] <%CaptainPileDriver> he's so confidant right now
[0:48:34] <+pupil31> SWAGNESS
[0:48:36] <RickyRelucent> soon you'll be backsteppping for ez running attacks
[0:48:36] <%eyezehuhh> eyezehuhh subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months! happy strum everyone! have the kind of day you deserve to have! much love
[0:48:37] <slix3431> So in terms of chat. Is advice about stats and game mechanics back-seating?
[0:48:37] <Treasure_Vault> I think reggie might have missed a crystal lizard or two in the barrels before and after the minotaur demon.
[0:48:40] <RickyRelucent> chain backstabbing invaders
[0:48:42] <Johannen> Longsword....yay
[0:48:43] <Solidnick18> aye longsword
[0:48:46] <RickyRelucent> soon enough c :
[0:48:52] <%hax_metatron> Longsword is my friend
[0:48:53] <Rawbone_saw> bro he's doing so well
[0:48:54] <%CaptainPileDriver> that confidence will disappear when the gargoyles show up
[0:48:59] <MrMatternot> It is quick to pyro the shield bearers
[0:48:59] <Johannen> Longsword is bae
[0:49:01] <GilliamYaeger> Eyy longsword
[0:49:01] <BigYanno> longsword and hollow shield are good
[0:49:05] <%ken_kuma> Longsword gang, baby
[0:49:07] <Rawbone_saw> @Johannen one of my faves
[0:49:10] <KyberNasse> haha that ghost guy got fucked
[0:49:12] <%hax_metatron> BEST WORKHORSE
[0:49:13] <didipackums1> Longsword gangggg
[0:49:17] <double_zr_tap> good ol' DS1
[0:49:21] <andre11dr> The boot was in DS3 right? i remember not seeing that much
[0:49:22] <%Ensign_Epic> equip the bass cannon instead
[0:49:24] <%Noonoox12> dark souls 1-3 longsword is always great
[0:49:28] <BigYanno> Longsword. It is a sword that is kinda long
[0:49:30] <%xxMylord> Longsword best weapon in the gmae
[0:49:40] <%ken_kuma> Longsword is Love
[0:49:43] <RickyRelucent> @Ensign_Epic does he even have 16 str and 13 dex
[0:49:45] <slix3431> Does Reggie know about the BSS?
[0:49:49] <RickyRelucent> i forget the actual stats
[0:49:55] <%X2Eliah> dongsword lessgo
[0:49:57] <andre11dr> DS2 had a terrible replacement for Da Boot
[0:49:58] <%Ensign_Epic> idk but if he don't he should
[0:50:00] <RickyRelucent> might be 10 dex
[0:50:01] <BigYanno> better stabiility but more weight. not worth imo
[0:50:03] <+RemedyofRevenge> make sure to compare the RIGHT side stats with the shield
[0:50:03] <@Menitta> How far we at
[0:50:04] <the_ugliest_known> HahaTurtledove
[0:50:11] <%Ensign_Epic> I think it's 10 as well lemme check
[0:50:16] <+RemedyofRevenge> it has better STAB
[0:50:22] <Rawbone_saw> @Menitta we might see tarus soon
[0:50:23] <andre11dr> @menitta We went backwards
[0:50:24] <RickyRelucent> it'll be ten
[0:50:28] <RickyRelucent> bandit starts with 9 dex
[0:50:30] <KyberNasse> Past the bridge shortcut
[0:50:31] <Johannen> GASP
[0:50:32] <BigYanno> it is not worse
[0:50:33] <RickyRelucent> takes only one lvl
[0:50:34] <RickyRelucent> kek
[0:50:37] <RickyRelucent> : d
[0:50:41] <+TheFrancix> 2 dex
[0:50:41] <%Ensign_Epic> yeh it's 10 Dex
[0:50:41] <AncyentMarinere> Better stability ***
[0:50:41] <daemonazaezal> Damage is EQUAL
[0:50:41] <Johannen> you take that back reggie
[0:50:49] <daemonazaezal> Weapons look left, shield on right
[0:50:49] <BigYanno> best to try weapons out
[0:50:49] <Slim_Lipid> motion values...
[0:50:53] <JehutyVer2> Longsword is great - as a placeholder until you get SKSS :)
[0:51:09] <%Noonoox12> it looks great
[0:51:09] <@Menitta> Dark Souls needs a charisma modifier
[0:51:09] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:51:10] <andre11dr> Things that drop from hollows usually suck shit
[0:51:11] <%Ensign_Epic> baller swag sword would be an amazing drop
[0:51:12] <Xaeveax> Yeah give everything at least a few swings to test them
[0:51:14] <RickyRelucent> trying out weapons is tricky
[0:51:14] <%CaptainPileDriver> no
[0:51:15] <BigYanno> 1 stability
[0:51:21] <RickyRelucent> if u wanna try em all out, u need a quality build
[0:51:22] <+anoldtoilet> stability is based.
[0:51:23] <andre11dr> Oh boy
[0:51:26] <@Menitta> for all the people you talk to
[0:51:26] <%Ensign_Epic> god the baller swag sword is so fun
[0:51:27] <RickyRelucent> or just know which u like
[0:51:27] <andre11dr> OHHHHJ BOY
[0:51:30] <Rawbone_saw> HEATER SHEEEIIILD
[0:51:32] <Rawbone_saw> let's gooooo
[0:51:35] <RickyRelucent> i dont see reggie doing a qualityy build off the bat
[0:51:37] <+ArcanumArcanum> more stability always better

[0:53:41] <+extradopeness> HES FEELING IT
[0:53:41] <%Ensign_Epic> YOU GON LEARN BOUT DAT DIRTY GREEDY ESTUS
[0:53:43] <%hax_metatron> That Black Knight has had YEARS of destroying noobs
[0:53:44] <RickyRelucent> its not a race
[0:53:45] <noelsbedroom> I love watching people's first run, this game is so good
[0:53:46] <RickyRelucent> is marathon
[0:53:59] <QueequegTheater> I swear it feels like enemies in 1 and 2 have faster animations while you're healing
[0:54:02] <Gelphaze> Man the black knights were much stronger back then.
[0:54:10] <ray9k9> Go ahead... take that.
[0:54:10] <+pupil31> üò≥
[0:54:10] <DreiDD> @noelsbedroom same, just watching all the emotions and reactions is so good
[0:54:11] <AncyentMarinere> He is actually very easy to parry the damage just TERRIFIES you
[0:54:13] <%cache_22> Is it easier to approach from the shield-side to strafe behind?
[0:54:18] <andre11dr> Man it's to see this guy not get backstabbed into infinity LUL
[0:54:18] <+askalta> woolie is right
[0:54:19] <%Seancicle> üí£
[0:54:20] <BigYanno> that black knight is a chump compared to later ones
[0:54:21] <ray9k9> take that sip
[0:54:28] <RickyRelucent> deppends on the angle of the attack @cache_22
[0:54:32] <%CappuccinoGuil> Take a sip, get hit
[0:54:33] <pixel_river> this brings back memories from launch day
[0:54:36] <+Rafraud> You can touch him
[0:54:40] <+Deekman> get up his butthole
[0:54:40] <derap41> Teach Reggie to eat ass woolie
[0:54:41] <slix3431> Clinch Reggie, Clinch is valid
[0:54:42] <%ken_kuma> Can you guys imagine if he gets that fucking sword though?
[0:54:42] <%CaptainPileDriver> until the knights with axes/glaives come out there bitches
[0:54:43] <+Chimeraelite> That's a callout. Fucking Smelter
[0:54:46] <%Ensign_Epic> I generally find going for the backstabs a bit easier myself but yeah the slower weapons are much easier to parry
[0:54:46] <RickyRelucent> usually right strafing is gud
[0:54:47] <thefreakmuseum> cut the angles, reggie, cut the cage off.
[0:54:47] <UnlimitedBick> @cache_22 technically no, because that's where his swing is "going"
[0:54:48] <%Grimlockfly> The Black Knight's only hurt box is that sword
[0:54:48] <Rionxgarland> wasnt the parry fames in this game a bit iffy
[0:54:49] <QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus If Reggie wants to parry, this Black Knight is the perfect parry
[0:54:49] <mikesapartment> hug him like a boxer
[0:54:49] <+ArcanumArcanum> in other words you can rub your dick right up against enemies and it's fine
[0:54:50] <+pupil31> LUL
[0:54:50] <SheefEatsBeef> locking on is a bait
[0:54:52] <QueequegTheater> *pracctice
[0:54:54] <noelsbedroom> @noelsbedroom i really hope elden ring brings in some of those ds1 moments
[0:54:57] <Rawbone_saw> man that axe is really decent
[0:55:03] <Rawbone_saw> i love it's hitboxes
[0:55:06] <andre11dr> It's pretty bizarre that the best way to play this game is to run up to enemys and spin around them
[0:55:19] <%Grimlockfly> @Rawbone_saw pyromancer is a great class
[0:55:22] <andre11dr> Like that's the optimal way
[0:55:24] <%Ensign_Epic> Hand axe is a VERY underrated weapon. Fast R1s & respectable damage.
[0:55:26] <+extradopeness> this LP wont stop giving
[0:55:27] <RickyRelucent> @andre11dr onlyy if your that ademant about not dying
[0:55:34] <DreiDD> @noelsbedroom man, that would be fantastic
[0:55:36] <+pupil31> don't sip
[0:55:37] <+Rasheedt> lmao
[0:55:37] <sirthomas2step> whats chats opinions on the no hit damage runners for this game?
[0:55:38] <%CateHecate> reggie needs to land a parry on the black knight if only so someone can put third strike parry sparks and hitstop on it
[0:55:42] <QueequegTheater> WOOLIE STOP PUSHING HIM AWAY FROM PARRYING
[0:55:44] <RickyRelucent> its only on humanoid enemies too
[0:55:45] <Solidnick18> he learning
[0:55:48] <sirthomas2step> inheriting ultra instinct for dark souls
[0:55:48] <+handlantern> i love seeing people experience this game for the first time
[0:55:52] <Rawbone_saw> @Rawbone_saw it really really is, i go deprived every time but starting with pyromancy is kinda busted
[0:55:56] <%holydeviant1> An important lesson for Reggie: Nothing in this game can ever be truly lost, you can ALWAYS get it back.
[0:55:56] <pixel_river> souls games are at their best when now one knows anything about whats in it and about the crptic hidden stuff
[0:55:57] <%CaptainPileDriver> "giant hitbox"
[0:55:59] <slix3431> I forgot can you chad parry a spearthrust?
[0:56:00] <andre11dr> @rickyrelucent Well by NG+6 you're really not
[0:56:02] <Xaeveax> He'll feel so good if he can parry the black knight.
[0:56:13] <teh_Question> parry this bitch reggie
[0:56:14] <RickyRelucent> fax, but thats the advanced player
[0:56:18] <RickyRelucent> not the casual enjoyer

[0:57:50] <Solidnick18> BIG BIG NUMBERS
[0:57:50] <%CaptainPileDriver> CHECK IT'S STATS
[0:57:51] <%Juriasu> I think the remaster increased the drop rate though
[0:57:51] <deviljhojho_> GAME OVER

[0:58:10] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:58:10] <%CaptainPileDriver> that's right woolie
[0:58:11] <user_naim> Lucky Reg strikes again!
[0:58:17] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Not true, endgame has infinite
[0:58:20] <+handlantern> so proud
[0:58:21] <+Deekman> this is insane
[0:58:22] <RickyRelucent> black knight halberd INC
[0:58:24] <QueequegTheater> You can farm the endgame ones
[0:58:24] <%ken_kuma> BEst sword. Don't care what anyone says
[0:58:25] <+Bitscreed> Truly a blade worthy of Reggarth.
[0:58:26] <MeImoth> Woolie is forgetting the last area
[0:58:28] <%Indigo_Automaton> CHAOS
[0:58:28] <%Ensign_Epic> Woolie, the Black Knight weapons can be farmed off of the respawning Black Knights in the final area.
[0:58:30] <+pupil31> The Luck Build is real
[0:58:33] <kikoeru_san> end game has respawning black knights
[0:58:34] <+ItsSansom> The spirit of Lucky Ted lives on
[0:58:36] <DXLelouch24> Reggie now your fucked in Dokapon tomorrow right? you used up all your luck
[0:58:36] <%CaptainPileDriver> that's true, the last area has one of each type
[0:58:43] <RickyRelucent> Yeah, but thats at the end
[0:58:45] <deviljhojho_> The CHUNK
[0:58:45] <%CaptainPileDriver> but still, getting one early game is GOOOD
[0:58:46] <%CappuccinoGuil> @Ensign_Epic that's a pointless farm, though
[0:58:52] <RickyRelucent> by then he'll be +14 + 5 +10 ez
[0:58:52] <AnthroMetal> are you fucking kidding me
[0:58:53] <andre11dr> Black Knight Halberd is the most OP one
[0:58:53] <AnthroMetal> the luck
[0:58:53] <BigYanno> not towards the end, at the VERY end. Just before the last boss
[0:58:55] <+Suneater_Jerome> I farmed at the end and still didn't get it
[0:58:56] <SheefEatsBeef> LMAO
[0:58:57] <RickyRelucent> on his gear
[0:58:57] <teh_Question> WE CHUNKIN
[0:58:58] <RickyRelucent> right
[0:58:58] <youngking_kush> Chaos Demon Wars
[0:59:00] <%CaptainPileDriver> EARLY GAME super weapon
[0:59:01] <+masarusasaki> MonkaS
[0:59:01] <QueequegTheater> monkaS
[0:59:07] <KeiganOfAstora> DAMNIT
[0:59:09] <%hax_metatron> RACE
[0:59:11] <+patriotrenegade> So... chunks, huh?
[0:59:11] <youngking_kush> Chaos Demon World War
[0:59:11] <KeiganOfAstora> I thought this was gonna be tomorrow
[0:59:11] <@Menitta> is it still good by end game
[0:59:12] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> that's a legit awesome drop you bastard lol
[0:59:13] <pixel_river> do speedrunners depend on strong equipment or they just skip everytinhg?
[0:59:14] <KeiganOfAstora> How much did I miss?
[0:59:16] <RyuuAoi> I'm late! I know! Is Reggie still stuck at the skeletons? Ha
[0:59:18] <%Ensign_Epic> @CappuccinoGuil Nope, it's the easiest, and you can even do it early if you do the wrongwarp
[0:59:25] <+Mr_Pylon> legendary slab
[0:59:28] <@Solidus_113> large shards?
[0:59:30] <%ken_kuma> Good times with that sword. Love that sword.
[0:59:31] <brunoberserk> then ... SUPER CHUNK
[0:59:34] <BigYanno> shards, large shards, chunks, slab
[0:59:35] <xxHungryxx> How many times has Reggie died?
[0:59:35] <%Lion_kun> Pump the stats for that weapon and you're set up to the end game.
[0:59:35] <Basic_Birch_> Large shards woolie
[0:59:36] <%CaptainPileDriver> large shards +5-10
[0:59:42] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> large shards is to +10 @woolieversus
[0:59:43] <velgaduere> shard, large shard, chunk, slab
[0:59:45] <%CaptainPileDriver> chunks +10
[0:59:47] <RickyRelucent> Kinda sad it has the weird guard like nazgul swords
[0:59:49] <%UnbreakableDoof> it doesn't matter chat
[0:59:50] <Xaeveax> Bloodborne had the best weapon upgrade currency I think.
[0:59:51] <RickyRelucent> still dope
[0:59:51] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's cool
[0:59:57] <%CaptainPileDriver> there's a bunch of upgrade materials
[0:59:58] <KeiganOfAstora> Damn he got the Black Knight Sword
[0:59:59] <glass_marcus> pump dex
[1:00:00] <KeiganOfAstora> Lucky bastard
[1:00:00] <+Suneater_Jerome> @pixel_river there are some strong weapons you can just book it to make life easier
[1:00:01] <DXLelouch24> fuck it everything will die
[1:00:04] <DXLelouch24> do it
[1:00:05] <+robertoszek> fact checking will ruin this LP!! LUL
[1:00:07] <%X2Eliah> are you NOT ganna use it?
[1:00:12] <%ken_kuma> I'm so fucking proud of Reggarth
[1:00:12] <GilliamYaeger> If you don't get the drop from the Black Knight on that series of slopes in Darkroot, it's a reset
[1:00:13] <%CaptainPileDriver> press y
[1:00:16] <RyuuAoi> Reggie got a good drop?
[1:00:16] <PMda2nd> BKS drop? nice
[1:00:18] <+askalta> he needs more Dex to two hand
[1:00:20] <AnthroMetal> just remember blue/red/green/white chunks too lol
[1:00:27] <%CappuccinoGuil> @Ensign_Epic I mean, sure, but on most regular playthroughs you're at the end with a decisive build done, so no point farming them
[1:00:29] <+Jack8274> That's a great weapon
[1:00:31] <+ArcanumArcanum> -177 KEKW
[1:00:33] <Rawbone_saw> @RyuuAoi like the best black night drop you can get
[1:00:34] <KeiganOfAstora> It's a larger weapon class. It's gonna do more damage no matter what
[1:00:35] <RickyRelucent> TWOHANDED WOOLIE
[1:00:36] <%CaptainPileDriver> IT'S WORTH IT
[1:00:38] <RickyRelucent> HE CAN TWOHAND IT
[1:00:39] <@Menitta> now dont use it because you are a sigma male and that will skip the grind
[1:00:41] <DXLelouch24> time to pump stats
[1:00:41] <RickyRelucent> if ha has 10 str
[1:00:41] <+anoldtoilet> yeah and 2 handing doesnt help with dex
[1:00:42] <+Catpurnicus> that 18 dex is the problem
[1:00:44] <pixel_river> @Suneater_Jerome  i see !
[1:00:44] <GilliamYaeger> TWOHAND IT
[1:00:44] <+anoldtoilet> so you NEED 18 dex
[1:00:44] <%hax_metatron> TWO HAND
[1:00:44] <Rawbone_saw> CAN HE?
[1:00:45] <AvroEltz> BIg sword for big boys
[1:00:47] <Rawbone_saw> TWO HAND
[1:00:47] <+Jack8274> You don't even need that many stats to two hand it
[1:00:51] <SheefEatsBeef> not with that dex
[1:00:51] <+terry_quest> still needs the dex
[1:00:52] <%Lion_kun> Pump strength and dex till you can use it.
[1:00:53] <%CodenameChaz> 8 fuckin' pounds of blade
[1:00:56] <KeiganOfAstora> Close
[1:00:56] <%UnbreakableDoof> He can't 2 hand it, he needs to hit the dex first
[1:00:58] <sendart> still need 18 dex
[1:00:58] <%X2Eliah> farm souls to get stats
[1:00:59] <+dalmek> same dex
[1:00:59] <xXVeggiePLusXx> Still 18 dex
[1:01:00] <%Ensign_Epic> @CappuccinoGuil NG+ exists. PvP exists.
[1:01:00] <andre11dr> I really like it ,i used it in DS3 for PVP
[1:01:01] <%jepupu> Dex doesn't scale 2-handing
[1:01:02] <RyuuAoi> @rawbone_saw Why God!? HE NEEDS TO SUFFER
[1:01:03] <MihajloMBlood> DEX does not reduce
[1:01:04] <+Catpurnicus> still 18 dex
[1:01:05] <+ArcanumArcanum> still need full DEX
[1:01:05] <$eco419> He needs the same dex
[1:01:05] <@Solidus_113> full dex
[1:01:05] <Treasure_Vault> 14 STR 18 dex
[1:01:06] <teh_Question> dex is the same
[1:01:06] <+Jack8274> No dex scaling
[1:01:06] <KeiganOfAstora> It's just for the Strength, Dex needs to be 18
[1:01:08] <Johannen> 18 dex
[1:01:08] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's worth investing
[1:01:09] <%Lion_kun> Dex does not reduce.
[1:01:10] <+terry_quest> he needs the dex
[1:01:10] <GeoGio3> dex stayss the same
[1:01:15] <a1teredbeast_iv> 18 DEX. two hand doesn't reduce dex scaling
[1:01:15] <NumbF4ke> dex doesn't get the two hand bonus, right?
[1:01:16] <KeiganOfAstora> Using two hands doesn't make your brain smarter Woolie
[1:01:17] <+askalta> 14 str 18 dex to twohand
[1:01:17] <+Jack8274> You can block! it has 60% reduction
[1:01:17] <+terry_quest> 2h only works with str
[1:01:18] <DXLelouch24> blockings for cowards
[1:01:19] <+anoldtoilet> yeah tyou need the normal amount of dex
[1:01:22] <%CaptainPileDriver> the black knight weapons can carry you the whole game
[1:01:22] <+anoldtoilet> doesnt get cut 2h
[1:01:23] <+Catpurnicus> start with the zwei
[1:01:23] <Solidnick18> if you want
[1:01:26] <+zanz_san> this was my quality build weapon
[1:01:30] <RyuuAoi> Use it, Reggie.
[1:01:43] <%Lion_kun> INVEST
[1:01:44] <andre11dr> What was the weapon the blocked like 80%?
[1:01:44] <SheefEatsBeef> you gotta COMMIT
[1:01:48] <RickyRelucent> casually
[1:01:48] <a1teredbeast_iv> endgame sword though!
[1:01:50] <RickyRelucent> yes
[1:01:50] <%holydeviant1> Like ten levels away ish
[1:01:52] <Xaeveax> Worth the commit I would say
[1:01:55] <andre11dr> I think it was Fume
[1:01:55] <a1teredbeast_iv> it'll carry you the rest of the game
[1:01:55] <+anoldtoilet> its a badass sword tho ngl
[1:01:57] <BigYanno> one day could be close than you think
[1:01:57] <RyuuAoi> Never mind. Throw it out, Reggie

[1:02:58] <Rawbone_saw> compromise? haha
[1:03:01] <MeImoth> small correction: two handing isn't a reduction in required STR needed, it counts your STR stat as if it was 1.5x your actual number, also for STR scaling bonus damage
[1:03:02] <%CaptainPileDriver> do it
[1:03:05] <RickyRelucent> gotta go to andre, and visit havel from there
[1:03:06] <SQDizzy> hole.

[1:04:09] <RickyRelucent> wonder if reggie will try to go to catacombs lvl apppropriately
[1:04:12] <xXVeggiePLusXx> No Black knight armor is a pick up not a drop
[1:04:14] <%Lion_kun> I got that weapon in my second run. I went to Ash Lake before Anor Londo so I could max it out by farming for twinkling.
[1:04:15] <RickyRelucent> most ppl just speedrun it at 40+
[1:04:16] <%Ensign_Epic> Hollow Warrior Waistcloth OP in early, memory serves
[1:04:18] <%UnbreakableDoof> I like to think that black knight was here to hunt the Tauros demon since they drop the same number of souls

[1:05:35] <thefreakmuseum> kick master
[1:05:35] <Trace_Bovier> Just a reminder that the black knight sword is swinging slow because you lack stats. if your stats are there your moveset is good and not slow.
[1:05:36] <RyuuAoi> It was bad for me in DS3
[1:05:38] <RickyRelucent> leave out some choice bits
[1:05:42] <+RaveBV> Guys, Woolie will figure it out.

[1:07:53] <kikoeru_san> Kill that bitch
[1:07:53] <Nogopharo> He's talking shit he needs to get hit
[1:07:53] <%Ensign_Epic> Don't kill him. Seriously. Don't.
[1:07:54] <+fgcmorad> Reggie's bloodthirst is kept in check
[1:07:54] <Slim_Lipid> you don't NEED arrows to go thru the game tho
[1:07:55] <+askalta> katanas are overated
[1:07:57] <KeiganOfAstora> This is so annoying stop backseating the backseating lol
[1:07:57] <RyuuAoi> LET WOOLIE COACH
[1:07:59] <zzNamttamzz> Do it psaSmug
[1:08:01] <JairusHopesItWorks> no sword its easy mode
[1:08:02] <+McSoliace> just buy them now then
[1:08:02] <andre11dr> Woolie stop killing our fun
[1:08:03] <Kekama> That sword sucks woolie dont let him do it
[1:08:04] <Xaeveax> I killed him on accident the first time. Never even knew he could talk.
[1:08:05] <RickyRelucent> i like murakumo for my katana
[1:08:07] <GilliamYaeger> kill heeem
[1:08:09] <+HelloImTom08> Woolie denies the weeb run
[1:08:10] <%Noonoox12> the drake sword is so boring
[1:08:11] <RickyRelucent> its not actually a katana
[1:08:12] <slix3431> Why does Reggie wanna off the merchant again?
[1:08:16] <RickyRelucent> but thats my choice
[1:08:23] <velgaduere> @slix3431 cuz he looked at him funny
[1:08:24] <KeiganOfAstora> @WoolieVersus The weapon is available at another location in the game. Don't make him do anything permanent
[1:08:27] <RickyRelucent> curved greatsword POG
[1:08:28] <+anoldtoilet> who needs the drake sword when reggarth has the bks
[1:08:28] <%CaptainPileDriver> @Noonoox12 yeah but it would help with the gargoyles
[1:08:33] <nabs96> @jairushopesitworks Disagree. Drake sword is only good for like half an area. it's not even worth it.
[1:08:36] <+askalta> I love curved greatswords. most unique class
[1:08:37] <noelsbedroom> Uchi is such a good first run weapon though
[1:08:38] <andre11dr> Everything he sells you can get later
[1:08:39] <+anoldtoilet> @KeiganOfAstora is it??
[1:08:50] <Puhff> No progress, just grind Kappa
[1:08:54] <%Noonoox12> @captainpiledriver I don't want that :)
[1:08:55] <slix3431> @velgaduere Mean streets of Lordran
[1:08:57] <RickyRelucent> true, he could speedrun tons of shit with uchi
[1:08:57] <photoniccaster> Are you gonna make him get the tail Woolie?
[1:08:58] <andre11dr> @askalta DS3 had some really good ones
[1:08:58] <RyuuAoi> But yes, Woolie. Let Reggie make his mistakes and kill NPCs ha
[1:08:59] <toulon_somberjade> @askalta I currently running the Fury sword
[1:08:59] <nabs96> @askalta woah look at this warrior from hammerfell
[1:09:00] <%Indigo_Automaton> The Drake sword only discourages you from trying other weapons in the early game
[1:09:05] <RickyRelucent> losing loyds and repair powder this early tho
[1:09:07] <%CaptainPileDriver> this isn't for the viewer, it's for reggie
[1:09:09] <RickyRelucent> i dunno
[1:09:11] <%Ensign_Epic> Drake's not as bad later on as people make it but yeah, it's not great lol
[1:09:12] <BigYanno> I remember the first few tiems I played dark souls I grinded here for hours
[1:09:17] <OhGeeWhy> i mean Uchi is great weapon, just buying stuff from merchant now and killing him sounds best cause. But then again Reggie is new player so pretty much let him play as he wants LuvHearts
[1:09:17] <MihajloMBlood> Yeah, Drake is a terrible idea for new players
[1:09:21] <RickyRelucent> if he does it now he'll have to go to andre for his boxes too
[1:09:23] <olm46> Drake's just not fun
[1:09:35] <daemonazaezal> THE. WORSE. MENU.
[1:09:36] <RyuuAoi> You need the sunny d more than anything.
[1:09:36] <MihajloMBlood> But the merchant has the Reinforced Club, it's unique to him and nobody else has it
[1:09:38] <andre11dr> Loved the Cartus great Sword, it was also OP as shit before the patch LUL
[1:09:41] <daemonazaezal> In all of dark souls
[1:09:46] <toulon_somberjade> Drake isn't fun but it's good for grinding to the weapon you want to use
[1:09:47] <Kekama> few good sources for dragon scales to make it ok
[1:09:51] <RickyRelucent> carthus was very nice.
[1:09:53] <%CaptainPileDriver> the drake sword is fine for everyone
[1:09:56] <RickyRelucent> loved the flips
[1:10:00] <noelsbedroom> I don't think woolie will push for the drake, it takes the challenge out very early on
[1:10:04] <SheefEatsBeef> i have never used this
[1:10:11] <Kalcom> but why
[1:10:12] <%nintega010> Tarkus
[1:10:14] <RyuuAoi> Reggie, what kinda controller you using?
[1:10:15] <%CappuccinoGuil> I hate the UI for the Bottomless Box
[1:10:25] <velgaduere> I wouldn't put your only ranged weapon away, but eh
[1:10:28] <%Ensign_Epic> @noelsbedroom he got the BKS drop. don't need to worry about the challenge being taken out if he levels for it
[1:10:32] <robobeau> They can go for drake, but ONLY if they don't use the coward bow method
[1:10:36] <@Menitta> is the moonlight greatsword still good if he has the black Knight sword
[1:10:37] <andre11dr> @noelsbedroom He has DKS anyway
[1:10:44] <RickyRelucent> options, options
[1:10:50] <RickyRelucent> damnit woolie beat me to it
[1:10:56] <OhGeeWhy> @Menitta yes if you go for STR / INT build
[1:10:59] <%CaptainPileDriver> @Menitta that sword is better with INT but he's not pumping that
[1:11:05] <%A_German_spy> @Menitta Only if he goes for an INT build
[1:11:08] <@Menitta> Ah
[1:11:08] <%Lion_kun> If it were me, I would farm soulda
[1:11:12] <Darren716> MLS won't be worth it unless he's dropping into int
[1:11:16] <%Ensign_Epic> MLGS & BKS are 2 different swords for 2 different builds
[1:11:17] <RickyRelucent> going quality, or like dex/int str/faith
[1:11:19] <RickyRelucent> its gonna be hard
[1:11:20] <robobeau> It would be nice to show Reggie that you can target tails BEFORE the gargoyles fight
[1:11:25] <%Lion_kun> If it were me, I would farm souls until I could use that sword.
[1:11:25] <RickyRelucent> cuz he's gonna love equipment load and sta
[1:11:27] <toulon_somberjade> Like after I got the Kirk's sword and the Astora sword I used those till I gotten Quaalag's Fury Sword
[1:11:30] <andre11dr> @menitta Hell probably just go for Pyro
[1:11:32] <teh_Question> @Menitta and if he really wants to go for it, it can be a bitch to get
[1:11:35] <RickyRelucent> and he'll wanna try out either all dex, or all str weps
[1:11:36] <%CappuccinoGuil> Hot boy zone? WHERE?!?!?!
[1:11:44] <%Lion_kun> Get the satisfaction of steam rolling the duo on top of the church.
[1:11:46] <@Menitta> I never put time into DS1 or 2. just 3 and bloodborne
[1:11:47] <+askalta> I hope he gets the claymore
[1:11:56] <Solidnick18> yep
[1:11:57] <%CappuccinoGuil> We always peeping at the hot boy zone KappaPride
[1:12:07] <%Ensign_Epic> a good, honest clay would be a nice sight, always is
[1:12:15] <Xaeveax> @askalta Same. That was my main first time through.
[1:12:15] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:12:15] <%CaptainPileDriver> @Menitta i've done a run of basically each major stat build, the MLGS is great for int, but my god is it a bitch to get
[1:12:20] <+patriotrenegade> i hope he gets poisoned
[1:12:30] <andre11dr> I hope he invests time into pyro  Chaos fire ball is so good in this game
[1:12:30] <RyuuAoi> @woolieversus Have you ever had a pet? Can you tell us about your pet dog in Grenada that used to swim in the ocean? Was his name really Dog? Pat told us.
[1:12:33] <robobeau> YO KICK THAT SKELLY OFF
[1:12:34] <@Solidus_113> small tip: if you run up those stairs and run back down as he's breathing fire you get a free 555 souls every time
[1:12:34] <robobeau> YEAH
[1:12:39] <%Josef_Stryker> LUL
[1:12:40] <Crownaux0> FOLLOW HIM
[1:12:40] <+kewlmyc> No way in hell he'll get the dragon claymore without woolie telling him. Way too obscure a process
[1:12:41] <+pupil31> LUL
[1:12:42] <RickyRelucent> mlgs is very fun, light sniping applications
[1:12:43] <+JaseAdrift> oooh
[1:12:44] <%Mkingston> mid air kill?
[1:12:48] <%A_German_spy> karacoLOL
[1:12:49] <+fgcmorad> almost
[1:12:50] <RickyRelucent> hitting the guy with both ur swing, and the projectile
[1:12:51] <RickyRelucent> is good dmg
[1:12:53] <velgaduere> Sparta everything, even yourself
[1:12:55] <Solidnick18> nice tail
[1:12:56] <+athuramn> reggie is really good with those kicks o:
[1:12:57] <nabs96> fun fact I've never gotten the moonlight GS in DS1. Every time I try Seath just moves and I always accidentally kill him

[1:13:17] <RickyRelucent> the trick weapon attacks were dope
[1:13:17] <%xxMylord> aww don't tell him about that OP weapon
[1:13:17] <@Solidus_113> it depends on the arrow type
[1:13:19] <+FlyingRamen> yeee
[1:13:19] <%Josef_Stryker> It depends on your dex
[1:13:20] <ElBuraindo> a clutch you mean
[1:13:22] <Lewisisphat> don't
[1:13:24] <LunarRemix> Does he even have a bow right now?
[1:13:26] <andre11dr> Not really that cool
[1:13:26] <+anoldtoilet> yea you hav eto literally sit there for 45 minutes shooting arrows
[1:13:28] <+VictorVonLouche> Boo game breaking
[1:13:33] <BigYanno> "I won't kill that dude yet" As if you could
[1:13:33] <+anoldtoilet> and reggie has better sword already
[1:13:33] <+HelloImTom08> woolie mentions the tail sword but no katanna c'mon bruh
[1:13:36] <+Reverend_Roscoe> It's a crutch!
[1:13:40] <%Lion_kun> Nah more like 20 minutes
[1:13:44] <%hax_metatron> STFU chat Woolie / Reggie should play the want they want

[1:13:59] <+tuchpi> pat mode LUL
[1:14:01] <%holydeviant1> @VictorVonLouche More bad-habit-forming. The Drake isn't effective much past the blacksmith.
[1:14:01] <RickyRelucent> @hax_metatron and were giving him options
[1:14:02] <%Lion_kun> Honestly the BKS far outstrips the dragon tail weapon.
[1:14:06] <RickyRelucent> dont u dare gatekeep reggie
[1:14:07] <@Solidus_113> FREE
[1:14:10] <%CappuccinoGuil> Free souls

[1:14:27] <andre11dr> Toasteeeee
[1:14:27] <%trigunstar26> reggie doing just fine with the axe. not every playthrough has to be done with uchi or drake sword
[1:14:29] <+askalta> item run
[1:14:29] <+anoldtoilet> get em
[1:14:35] <%CaptainPileDriver> for normal arrows it would take 40-50 arros
[1:14:37] <Nogopharo> noooo
[1:14:37] <%CaptainPileDriver> *arrows
[1:14:41] <%Ensign_Epic> I don't think it takes that long if you're actually properly hitting the tail, which is an issue to do, the hitbox for tail vs body is weird
[1:14:46] <BigYanno> you can't aim the crossbow
[1:14:47] <+robertoszek> "gentle" push to buy arrows LUL
[1:14:48] <%CaptainPileDriver> use the bow
[1:14:53] <%CaptainPileDriver> you can't aim the crossbow
[1:14:55] <%CappuccinoGuil> He had a crossbow, I believe
[1:15:04] <+askalta> are we really doing this
[1:15:07] <@Menitta> god every time I see the ladder slide animation I think of that bloodborne video with the cone helmet
[1:15:09] <RickyRelucent> yeah, avelyn shit
[1:15:12] <upsettie> Woolie looking kinda gingery
[1:15:18] <user_naim> @askalta i was typing that exact message
[1:15:31] <+anoldtoilet> yea its not like demons souls
[1:15:35] <+anoldtoilet> no item weight unless equipped
[1:15:39] <%CappuccinoGuil> Merchant sells a bow
[1:15:41] <RickyRelucent> @Menitta DansGame NotLikeThis LUL
[1:15:44] <Nogopharo> Thank god
[1:15:44] <andre11dr> Did the DeS Remake let you aim with the crossbows? Never used them
[1:15:49] <%CaptainPileDriver> merchant sells a bow
[1:15:54] <+anoldtoilet> LUL
[1:15:54] <LunarRemix> The merchant sells a bow
[1:15:56] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[1:16:00] <+robertoszek> LUL
[1:16:02] <%CaptainPileDriver> regardless, you do what you want reggie
[1:16:06] <+JaseAdrift> LUL any merchant but him
[1:16:08] <+anoldtoilet> you dont need the drake swords bad moveset >_> progress reggie
[1:16:12] <+anoldtoilet> <_<
[1:16:13] <Johannen> Crisis averted
[1:16:17] <warpiscute> in all my runs i never used the bottomless box once
[1:16:20] <%CaptainPileDriver> probably like 800
[1:16:21] <andre11dr> Woolie really loves that merchant
[1:16:26] <thefreakmuseum> i feel like he would get better backstabs if he unlocked and sprinted around the mob to better understand the hurtbox on the BS.
[1:16:29] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> Reggath reaaaally wanna Backstab....
[1:16:31] <RickyRelucent> drakesword has the same animations as longsword
[1:16:37] <%GeneralSCPatton> You do need a LOT of arrows

[1:16:45] <RickyRelucent> cant be upgraded, tho.
[1:16:47] <pixel_river> do what you want reggiw
[1:16:47] <Johannen> Woolie cursed us
[1:16:49] <%Ensign_Epic> @thefreakmuseum You're probably right, honestly
[1:16:49] <+fgcmorad> Not a fan of the drake sword but if it means not seaing that axe anymore, I'm ok with it
[1:16:59] <andre11dr> God damn that sound
[1:16:59] <%Mkingston> Did Reggie open that chest by the black knight yet?
[1:17:08] <+askalta> 2 handing breaks gaurd like the kicks
[1:17:11] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @fgcmorad what, you don't like hitting for 25 a swing?
[1:17:11] <RyuuAoi> He's just giving Reggie options, Chat.
[1:17:12] <thefreakmuseum> hes hitting the side of the back has to center up more
[1:17:13] <+masarusasaki> starting to sound like the berserk 2016 anime
[1:17:15] <andre11dr> That's the reason nobody uses this set
[1:17:18] <+extradopeness> he did @mkingston
[1:17:21] <AvroEltz> Kinda of unlucky reggie didnt get the battle axe
[1:17:26] <+fgcmorad> @abelincoln_catpuncher LUL
[1:17:26] <%Mkingston> @extradopeness  phew
[1:17:30] <%glaciomaniak> I used the drake sword on my first playthrough and it kinda felt like cheating
[1:17:31] <teh_Question> the hollow solider's death noise is always funny to me
[1:17:37] <Basic_Birch_> Reggies hate of the shopkeep feels similar to woolies hate of haircut and the faith gang
[1:17:50] <%Ensign_Epic> everyone hates petrus though
[1:17:51] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> the drake sword is fine, especially since upgrading it useless and expensive
[1:17:52] <%CaptainPileDriver> you have enough for 100 arrows
[1:17:52] <%Ensign_Epic> he's petrus
[1:17:59] <@Solidus_113> go for 100
[1:17:59] <andre11dr> GET EM
[1:18:05] <@Solidus_113> 100 normal
[1:18:09] <%CaptainPileDriver> 100 normal
[1:18:10] <%Lion_kun> standard will do it
[1:18:13] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> you need 150ish iirc
[1:18:15] <%holydeviant1> @glaciomaniak It's practically useless after Sen's, and if you're using it too much, you often fail to upgrade other stuff. Newbie trap.
[1:18:16] <upsettie> boo this man , boo him
[1:18:17] <+kewlmyc> like 100 arrows. 30 isn't going to be enough, especially since Reggie WILL miss a few shots.
[1:18:38] <+askalta> never realized arrows do thrust
[1:18:43] <%CaptainPileDriver> standard
[1:18:45] <+extradopeness> patches was right. clerics deserve nothing.
[1:18:46] <+anoldtoilet> yeah its literally like 100 shots
[1:18:50] <%CaptainPileDriver> get 50
[1:18:52] <+Rafraud> we shooting the dragon?
[1:18:54] <%Lion_kun> Get 70
[1:18:58] <%CaptainPileDriver> yeah
[1:19:00] <+anoldtoilet> i feel like its not being stated enough that you have to stand there shooting the tail for a long time
[1:19:00] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> we shooting the dragon
[1:19:00] <+kewlmyc> No
[1:19:00] <%CaptainPileDriver> that should be enough
[1:19:02] <+anoldtoilet> lol
[1:19:03] <Zaphire_Saucypants> cool
[1:19:10] <velgaduere> lobosKek
[1:19:10] <@Solidus_113> you'd have to hit all shots
[1:19:16] <RickyRelucent> rn reggie only has an unupgraded axe
[1:19:16] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:19:19] <+kewlmyc> Or maybe I'm remembering wrong. It's been years
[1:19:24] <RickyRelucent> might aswell be a thicc as drakesword
[1:19:25] <+Rafraud> This will be a teaching moment
[1:19:27] <%Ensign_Epic> yeh arrows deal thrust because for all practical purposes thrust may as well mean piercing
[1:19:29] <RickyRelucent> for about one area
[1:19:32] <%glaciomaniak> @holydeviant1 I did eventually switch to the uchi and great scythe
[1:19:42] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> doesn't he only need 1 dex to use the longsword??
[1:19:42] <%CaptainPileDriver> OH NO
[1:19:42] <Johannen> We are saved
[1:19:43] <velgaduere> no stats lobosKek
[1:19:44] <+anoldtoilet> no stats for the bow LUL
[1:19:46] <GeoGio3> not enough dex
[1:19:47] <noelsbedroom> LMAOO
[1:19:48] <%CaptainPileDriver> NO STATS FOR THE BOW
[1:19:49] <+anoldtoilet> time to level up
[1:19:51] <zzNamttamzz> Praise the dex
[1:19:52] <sendart> LUL
[1:19:53] <+anoldtoilet> to get the drake sword
[1:19:54] <+anoldtoilet> LUL
[1:20:03] <%Javaa01> Remember to take the crossbow bolts off, those are just unnecessary weight
[1:20:03] <%Lion_kun> Does dex matter for the tail?
[1:20:06] <Treasure_Vault> No it won't lol
[1:20:07] <mikesapartment> it wont work without the dex
[1:20:14] <%CaptainPileDriver> man, y'all chat are mad about reggie getting any form of help
[1:20:14] <Lewisisphat> man, you can just get the draon on the bridge and cut its tail off and it's way quicker
[1:20:16] <%xxMylord> yeah it's about damage not about amount of hits
[1:20:18] <%Ensign_Epic> Any weapon whose damage looks like it's a pointy, piercing thing will use Thrust. Lucerne is an example, Pickaxe is another.
[1:20:18] <Lewisisphat> *dragon
[1:20:19] <RickyRelucent> I usually start hunter when i go for my dex shit, and even then im using str cuz its murakumo lol
[1:20:21] <GeoGio3> it won''t damage
[1:20:22] <%CaptainPileDriver> has to be right hand
[1:20:22] <RickyRelucent> XD
[1:20:25] <user_naim> It‚Äôs just less fun to watch when a first time player has an early game lightsaber. Selfish, but what can you do
[1:20:26] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> but the damage will be shit
[1:20:28] <Vigogs> saved from drake sword lets go
[1:20:30] <TwigsMcWhitey> @Javaa01 Ammo doesn't count toward weight
[1:20:40] <Scorchfield> the drake sword really shouldn't be used after the second bell, hopefully Woolie will tell him that if hes still using it at that point
[1:20:50] <%CaptainPileDriver> if it's gonna be bad you might as well progress
[1:20:55] <Rawbone_saw> oh we DOIN THIS
[1:21:03] <MrMatternot> You will do ~1-5 point of dmg per arrow
[1:21:06] <Xaeveax> Glad to see he is really using the kick
[1:21:06] <andre11dr> I'm low key hoping he doesn't get it
[1:21:08] <Rawbone_saw> falchion KICK
[1:21:14] <teh_Question> farm some stair souls until you get 12 dex
[1:21:21] <+anoldtoilet> wtfMiner wtfPickaxe
[1:21:22] <warpiscute> by the time the drake sword is bad you almost immediately find the lightning spear anyway
[1:21:31] <MrMatternot> It is not worth it without levels
[1:21:39] <KyberNasse> Getting the Cheese Sword is part of the 1st timer experience
[1:21:41] <Vigogs> sick poise
[1:21:42] <+anoldtoilet> lmao gg reggie
[1:21:44] <Rawbone_saw> bitch assss
[1:21:47] <Rawbone_saw> got im
[1:21:51] <Reisadan> Reggie vs.... THE SURGE!?!?! (no, never.)
[1:21:54] <+anoldtoilet> he will 100 percent not have enough arrows for this
[1:21:56] <+anoldtoilet> LUL
[1:22:06] <%CaptainPileDriver> he doesn't have enough arrows for this low damage
[1:22:09] <Xaeveax> This is going to be 60 arrows leading to not enough damage
[1:22:11] <%Ensign_Epic> this is not gonna work now
[1:22:11] <%BallerSwagBro9k> BRUH
[1:22:12] <Johannen> @KyberNasse If you know about the drake sword on your first playthrou, you went wrong somewhere
[1:22:14] <Who_lio42> i wish more people played surge

[1:22:37] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @velgaduere LMAO
[1:22:37] <sendart> some parts of the tail doesnt count
[1:22:38] <%Ensign_Epic> yeah he's not even hitting the proper hitbox
[1:22:39] <@Solidus_113> the cheese
[1:22:41] <robobeau> ORRRRRRRRRRR
[1:22:44] <robobeau> You could not be a coward
[1:22:46] <ALvl78Zapdos> LOL
[1:22:51] <+terry_quest> did it even do damage?
[1:22:53] <user_naim> Do all of this and then discard the sword
[1:22:53] <+anoldtoilet> you have to hit the bottom of the tail also ytou dont have enough arrows
[1:22:54] <MrMatternot> Hit at the wide part of tail.
[1:22:54] <andre11dr> I tried playing The Surge, good very board half way through
[1:22:54] <%jepupu> What's the damage though? Probably something like 1-2?
[1:22:56] <+anoldtoilet> lmfao
[1:22:57] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @velgaduere I hope that's edited in the Best Of
[1:22:58] <%CappuccinoGuil> *7 hours later*
[1:22:58] <Reisadan> The Surge 2 is quite great however, just that part 1 is clearly a freshman effort
[1:23:01] <ElBuraindo> Don't listen to him Reggie
[1:23:02] <Darren716> Honestly don't bother for this
[1:23:03] <%hax_metatron> Imagine thinking Reggie is a coward for doing this LUL Dark Souls has so many tryhard fans
[1:23:04] <+pupil31> OH NONO LUL
[1:23:05] <%cobalt_phoenix_> if you can hit the tail while close it goes way faster
[1:23:07] <Deasmeister> 10mins ish
[1:23:07] <Solidnick18> LUL
[1:23:07] <%A_German_spy> This right here is the true Souls experience.
[1:23:08] <Johannen> Are we realy doing this?
[1:23:08] <xXVeggiePLusXx> I don't know if its even doing damage
[1:23:09] <+anoldtoilet> lmfao this is great
[1:23:11] <velgaduere> @abelincoln_catpuncher lobosKek
[1:23:11] <GilliamYaeger> Not worth it.
[1:23:12] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I smell bitch in Reggies heart
[1:23:12] <Treasure_Vault> He's already wasted too many, even if he had enough dex
[1:23:13] <+robertoszek> "60 should be enough"
[1:23:16] <DXLelouch24> Minh should prob edit this part
[1:23:19] <teh_Question> woolie you gotta tell him about how garbo that reticle is
[1:23:19] <upsettie> thanks Black Pat
[1:23:20] <+askalta> the black knight sword is so much better
[1:23:20] <didipackums1> LUL
[1:23:22] <iacus_> "let's play poison"
[1:23:23] <%CaptainPileDriver> you aren't doing the damage you need, just wait until you get enough dex
[1:23:24] <Xaeveax> I would come back
[1:23:26] <+swesterly> Not enough arrows
[1:23:27] <xXVeggiePLusXx> The arrows are bouncing off LUL
[1:23:31] <RyuuAoi> Chat so toxic rn. Did you get to play the game the way you wanted to? So let Reggie do his thing.
[1:23:32] <%Ensign_Epic> ohthankgod
[1:23:35] <MrMatternot> Go get dex
[1:23:38] <%GeneralSCPatton> How many arrows did he bring?
[1:23:42] <%Lion_kun> 5x longer lol
[1:23:43] <%Mkingston> "so we've been levelling up off camera"
[1:23:44] <w_khan> There is a sweet spot to aim so you hit both him far and close
[1:23:45] <andre11dr> My problem with The Surge is that the environment and enemys suck shit
[1:23:46] <%jepupu> Probably something like 200 arrows instead of 60
[1:23:46] <Zantetzuken> 60
[1:23:47] <+kewlmyc> Dexbois stay winning
[1:23:47] <BigYanno> don't forget to take the bow off
[1:23:48] <KyberNasse> When theyll remake this in 2050 they should add a mechanic where the drake looks below the bridge and grills you
[1:23:49] <robobeau> I wish Woolie would tell him the alternate way of getting that sword
[1:23:50] <MrMatternot> The tail has its own HP
[1:23:51] <+Deekman> he could go fight the dragon legit and just cut the tail
[1:23:52] <Zaphire_Saucypants> People really out here using the word "coward" for an option left in the video game.
[1:23:55] <iacus_> yeah but I played in the silence of my own room, not streamed to hundreds xD
[1:23:55] <+JaseAdrift> We need V here to give chat the good old STFU
[1:23:56] <%CaptainPileDriver> @GeneralSCPatton only 60 for a bow that he can't wield proper
[1:23:57] <+anoldtoilet> @RyuuAoi yeah woolie, stop telling reggie what to do. Kappa
[1:24:00] <+fgcmorad> #DexGang
[1:24:01] <Reisadan> All I want for christmas.... is drake sword
[1:24:02] <upsettie> Black Knight Sword > Woolie being a Troll teacher
[1:24:02] <+askalta> how
[1:24:08] <%GeneralSCPatton> @captainpiledriver LUL LUL LUL csbeastSetIn
[1:24:08] <+Jiggisnipe> @KyberNasse LOL
[1:24:08] <+paladinstarbuster> He has the BKS why would he need the tail weapon?
[1:24:09] <%CaptainPileDriver> @iacus_ this isn't for you, it's for reggie
[1:24:13] <%joker626> can't you just farm the dragon bringe for souls?
[1:24:13] <KeiganOfAstora> I like making the run for the Sunlight Altar bonfire. It's nicer than having to deal with the rats every time and you can warp there later
[1:24:18] <andre11dr> Yeeeey
[1:24:19] <%xxMylord> @Zaphire_Saucypants There is also a glitch to get infinite souls is that fine to use?
[1:24:24] <Radical_Dreamer> Chat, let the man experience the game, good lord
[1:24:24] <andre11dr> No wack sword
[1:24:28] <BigYanno> dragon path is the path of MEN
[1:24:28] <MrMatternot> He can get enough souls to level up dec from the tower night about 10 meters away
[1:24:33] <+kewlmyc> I mean, Chat can say whatever they want, it's not like they're reading chat anymore
[1:24:34] <ElBuraindo> if anything, this is a strong item meant for anyone who manages to find it by themselves somehjow, like the MegamanX Hadou/Shoryu
[1:24:38] <%CappuccinoGuil> It's good to always bait that firebreath when you come back, for free souls
[1:24:40] <BigYanno> REAL men don't fear the flame!

[1:33:17] <Reisadan> They had ONE job
[1:33:17] <%haitakaa> does he have any humanity?
[1:33:21] <velgaduere> I don't think he even knows what happened
[1:33:21] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1455421207659139081?t=Np244HCpRXfSBOkB2__Gpw&s=19
[1:33:24] <andre11dr> He might do it
[1:33:26] <%Josef_Stryker> Yup
[1:33:26] <%Rafoki> His wild swings saved him
[1:33:27] <WizardofWazz> ONE JOB
[1:33:28] <Solidnick18> YEAH
[1:33:31] <+Rafraud> There we go
[1:33:31] <mikesapartment> maybe kindle the bonfire
[1:33:31] <thefreakmuseum> so close
[1:33:32] <%nintega010> alright we need a stronger weapon now
[1:33:32] <noelsbedroom> csbeastSetIn this guy's luck
[1:33:39] <%trigunstar26> DAYUM
[1:33:39] <pixel_river> good run
[1:33:39] <thefreakmuseum> the weapon is fine
[1:33:41] <andre11dr> Nope
[1:33:42] <RyuuAoi> Where is your confidence, Reggie!?
[1:33:42] <RickyRelucent> just DONT DIE AGAIN
[1:33:42] <Rawbone_saw> the axe is pretty great tho
[1:33:43] <PMda2nd> not quite averted
[1:33:45] <RickyRelucent> get that back first
[1:33:45] <+Rafraud> Reggie with the literal highest luck skill
[1:33:48] <Treasure_Vault> No one ever reads the skull description
[1:33:49] <+extradopeness> expectations were high, to say the least
[1:33:49] <RickyRelucent> but dont just rush in
[1:33:50] <blackostream> LUL
[1:33:52] <velgaduere> I mean, it's not like you should just LEAVE them there
[1:33:56] <RyuuAoi> YEAH SOULS NEVER MATTERED
[1:33:57] <%Mkingston> They don't matter post-Sen's Fortress
[1:34:00] <%Ensign_Epic> hand axe is fine, this just has no upgrade levels into it
[1:34:05] <+liquidzr0> danCopium
[1:34:12] <andre11dr> I mean he ain't wrong
[1:34:13] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> at least get your souls back first
[1:34:15] <+HelloImTom08> Souls are temporary, getting good is forever
[1:34:16] <%Javaa01> Remember tho Woolie, doing that makes the Dragon go away forever
[1:34:17] <kikosmore> woolie bout to sabotage this man lol.
[1:34:20] <%nintega010> then upgrade it
[1:34:21] <blackostream> Souls dont matter in Dark SOULS LUL (it do be kinda true tho  LUL )
[1:34:22] <+masarusasaki> The souls were the friends we made along the way
[1:34:23] <%Javaa01> So no sword
[1:34:24] <RyuuAoi> What does the skull do?
[1:34:24] <RickyRelucent> souls dont matter, but we all know that pain of losing tons of souls
[1:34:29] <+Pinkiefan> Where can I find the schedule? I need to watch some more Dokapon.
[1:34:30] <+pupil31> hmm...
[1:34:30] <andre11dr> You'll always get enough souls from the boss
[1:34:31] <%BallerSwagBro9k> "Opening" under the dragon Kappa
[1:34:32] <RickyRelucent> i'd rather saved them then not
[1:34:33] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @javaa01 no it comes back
[1:34:33] <Slim_Lipid> licorice man and his moldy chainmail
[1:34:40] <velgaduere> Reggie doing calculus
[1:34:46] <noelsbedroom> @velgaduere -\
[1:34:49] <%CaptainPileDriver> @velgaduere WAS ABOUT TO SAY THAT
[1:34:50] <TigerClaws12> he's gonna get that BKGS
[1:34:52] <Crownaux0> @Slim_Lipid I'd buy that children's book
[1:34:53] <+Deekman> @WoolieVersus you can also just hide behind the corner for a couple of seconds and he'll come down instead of shooting arrows
[1:34:55] <%A_German_spy> @Pinkiefan Woolie has it posted on his Twitter.
[1:34:57] <+fgcmorad> @pinkiefan on his twitter, dokapon is tmr
[1:34:58] <CrimsonGargoyle> we need a gif of reggie doing calculus
[1:34:58] <+rubeSandwich> Quick maths
[1:34:59] <vivaciouseff> @Javaa01 you can get drake to return by running back down the bridge
[1:35:01] <sendart> run fast good
[1:35:01] <%CaptainPileDriver> do the corner trick
[1:35:01] <+Rasheedt> @ryuuaoi attract enemies
[1:35:03] <wantedsafe471> Reggie doing a crestfallen warrior run
[1:35:15] <+Pinkiefan> @fgcmorad Thanks!
[1:35:21] <@Menitta> !schedule
[1:35:21] <@Moobot> @Menitta Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1455421207659139081?t=Np244HCpRXfSBOkB2__Gpw&s=19
[1:35:26] <RyuuAoi> @rasheedt Reggie ain't ready ha
[1:35:32] <justcallmebobplease> Reggie is doing a good job making Woolie seem less spatially unaware in these games - good job helping out Woolie, Reggie!
[1:35:32] <%CaptainPileDriver> there's those walls that you can hide behind
[1:35:56] <Johannen> Woolie is dooming Reggie
[1:35:57] <velgaduere> now the question is
[1:35:58] <Reisadan> Believe in the Pockets that believes in KICKS
[1:35:58] <thefreakmuseum> just hold shield up and run through at right timing imo :)
[1:36:03] <velgaduere> will he pick up the items on the way
[1:36:09] <velgaduere> or will he choose life instead
[1:36:10] <%Mkingston> I never bothered with this bonfire
[1:36:12] <+Pinkiefan> Last time I played DS I did a handaxe build.  It was fun.
[1:36:12] <RickyRelucent> You can in other ways
[1:36:16] <andre11dr> mm...i smell crispy bacon and Claymore
[1:36:19] <RickyRelucent> u can go right above the stairs
[1:36:20] <%TheBesteban> You can also just stare at him
[1:36:23] <RickyRelucent> and make him land on the bridge
[1:36:28] <%Lion_kun> You could also hide behind the wall upstairs.
[1:36:28] <wantedsafe471> Best sword on the bridge
[1:36:29] <RickyRelucent> then run past
[1:36:32] <Kekama> scuffed
[1:36:35] <%Lion_kun> He eventually moves.
[1:36:35] <%CaptainPileDriver> @TheBesteban stare at him from behind a wall
[1:36:39] <sendart> NotLikeThis
[1:36:41] <+Deekman> if he hides behind that small wall at the top of the stairs the fire won't get him and after a few seconds the dragon will come down
[1:36:42] <elshadow7> If you wait behind the stairs at the top, it'll come down eventually
[1:36:48] <%Ensign_Epic> dragons hate being stared at
[1:36:52] <BurdRightsActivist> They call me Reggie "circlestrafe" Backstab
[1:36:53] <user_naim> [Homer‚Äôs fake name]
[1:36:54] <@Menitta> menacingly
[1:37:01] <Rawbone_saw> clean
[1:37:05] <%Indigo_Automaton> You don't need to shoot him
[1:37:09] <RickyRelucent> pog
[1:37:12] <+rubeSandwich> The idea of facing a dragon to avoid some rats is hilarious to me
[1:37:12] <elshadow7> It'll breath and then come down
[1:37:16] <Treasure_Vault> If you stand on the bridge in a spot the fire doesn't hit, he comes down
[1:37:19] <bacon_209> too much hand holding
[1:37:21] <%Josef_Stryker> He can't use it LUL
[1:37:21] <+patriotrenegade> yes reggie. do this
[1:37:23] <%CaptainPileDriver> you will not have time to run
[1:37:32] <%Ensign_Epic> agreed
[1:37:36] <justcallmebobplease> Reggie no think good.
[1:37:36] <+Deekman> i've never seen this way with a bow lol
[1:37:36] <velgaduere> @Josef_Stryker he can well enough for the plan to work
[1:37:38] <Reisadan> omg attempting this with THAT amount of arrows? Courage.

[1:50:19] <+McSoliace> you have more weapons in your box
[1:50:19] <+Rafraud> One hand axe playthrough
[1:50:21] <+anoldtoilet> definitely 2h the axe, you go through blocks with it
[1:50:22] <Xaeveax> As opposed to boar stairs
[1:50:23] <+anoldtoilet> if you do that
[1:50:27] <velgaduere> as opposed to metal boar stairs
[1:50:28] <+anoldtoilet> like your axe wont bounce back
[1:50:32] <+anoldtoilet> you just attack through shiels
[1:50:32] <%trigunstar26> @TheRaubvogel reggie got black knight sword first try
[1:50:33] <+Rafraud> Now I'm down for the axe
[1:50:34] <%hax_metatron> This is such a genius little teaching placement, man I love the Undead Parish so much
[1:50:37] <+terry_quest> has he ever tried 2h things?
[1:50:37] <warpiscute> i think the claymore needs a stronger recommendation
[1:50:45] <+extradopeness> reggarth the kickboxing undead
[1:50:46] <%hax_metatron> Claymore is phenomenal
[1:50:46] <velgaduere> 3 bong
[1:50:48] <andre11dr> He can just hit them and win 4Head
[1:50:51] <+patriotrenegade> Did you know staircases in at fire stations are spiral to prevent teh horses from coming upstairs when they smell food being cooked
[1:50:51] <+McSoliace> like the long sword
[1:50:54] <velgaduere> oi it's 3 bong
[1:50:55] <RyuuAoi> Don't forget your lunges, Reggie
[1:51:05] <+Rafraud> I think Reggie has kicked more than anyone who has played DS ever
[1:51:07] <RickyRelucent> Once he plays with claymore and realizes the power of double r2s
[1:51:10] <bacon_209> why not morning star
[1:51:10] <churropoppa> Where's everyone going? Bingo?
[1:51:11] <+anoldtoilet> the kick is great
[1:51:11] <Treasure_Vault> Reggie must internalize the guard break frontstab
[1:51:13] <RickyRelucent> the glorious running attack
[1:51:17] <+terry_quest> or let me rephrase has woolie told him that the upside to 2h weapons is more damage?
[1:51:17] <%hax_metatron> I think Reggie should seriously consider trying sword class weapons, he has two GREAT workhorses in Longsword and Claymore
[1:51:17] <RickyRelucent> and the nice r1s
[1:51:19] <w_khan> Is the pig hollow? did it lose all of his souls?
[1:51:20] <+fgcmorad> that axe isn't it chief
[1:51:22] <+anoldtoilet> reggie is kicking like i did in ds3 pvp
[1:51:23] <RickyRelucent> he'll love clayyymore fast enough
[1:51:25] <+wynnewake> my friend got the world first DS3 Guitar Hero no hit run. I cannot ever imagine pulling something like that off.

[2:04:03] <QueequegTheater> DO IT
[2:04:07] <+anoldtoilet> almost everything
[2:04:08] <elshadow7> This one's probably the riskiest one to parry
[2:04:08] <%trigunstar26> yes he did
[2:04:10] <%CodenameChaz> @Reverend_Roscoe That he did, and got the sword
[2:04:10] <slothtouchingcloth> First knight is dead
[2:04:11] <%Indigo_Automaton> Most humanoid enemies
[2:04:11] <%IronOhki> Get that zero.

[2:04:17] <Johannen> human size/ 1.5 humans
[2:04:18] <%trigunstar26> got the sword
[2:04:19] <RickyRelucent> i'd say this one is easier to parryy then the normal greatsword one
[2:04:22] <%holydeviant1> 1
[2:04:25] <+Reverend_Roscoe> Oh shit, that's awesome
[2:04:27] <Admiral_PopnFresh> 3
[2:04:27] <+anoldtoilet> you can parry most melee attacks iirc
[2:04:28] <+TopTieramisu> he got down
[2:04:28] <RickyRelucent> wouldn't try parrying the charged r2 tho
[2:04:29] <guiltyboya> oof
[2:04:29] <%IronOhki> He's a toughboy.
[2:04:30] <+Rafraud> BLOCK THIS OVERHEAD
[2:04:33] <+patriotrenegade> Woolie, he is like 8 feet tall
[2:04:33] <moonmintparadise> those fucking moans
[2:04:33] <elshadow7> Might be easier to parry, but one hit and you're done
[2:04:33] <%LastHazzerd> i forgot how cheese these guys' tracking are
[2:04:36] <Solidnick18> they mean business
[2:04:36] <+liquidzr0> shofuMillyrock
[2:04:39] <@Menitta> you cannot parry Galactica phantom
[2:04:40] <%IronOhki> Parry OK. Backstab OK.
[2:04:41] <QueequegTheater> That one lunge is super BS
[2:04:42] <%Juriasu> PARRY PARRY
[2:04:43] <AvroEltz> it would be busted if you could parry everything, like, imagine if you could parry the last boss
[2:04:43] <%holydeviant1> One damage on that run!
[2:04:45] <%Indigo_Automaton> If I'm not mistaken you can parry the thrusts but not the rising upswing
[2:04:46] <+TopTieramisu> just win 4Head
[2:04:48] <%BallerSwagBro9k> STRIKE
[2:04:48] <+Sir_Louis> imo this is the hardest black knight in the game, worth leaving lol
[2:04:49] <+Rafraud> Nah just do the fight
[2:04:51] <leomuratore> He didn't get his souls back, did he?
[2:04:53] <wantedsafe471> At least the black knights arent like heide knight. man i hate them

[2:05:00] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @leomuratore no
[2:05:01] <%ken_kuma> Man fucks another man dressed as a knight
[2:05:03] <Xaeveax> It's a shame he doesn't have a good new sword in his inventory.
[2:05:05] <+extradopeness> i am definitely screaming parry lol
[2:05:08] <velgaduere> @leomuratore he lost those two deaths ago
[2:05:10] <%BallerSwagBro9k> SUPPLEX HIM DOWN THE STAIR
[2:05:10] <Rawbone_saw> heater sheild is out here, holding reggie bein like "we got this guy"
[2:05:12] <QueequegTheater> I like how Woolie, who actively refuses to parry in every Souls game, is insistent that it's not worth it
[2:05:15] <andre11dr> You did get down...on the floor
[2:05:16] <%hax_metatron> If Reggie cheeses this fight, he has learned Dark Souls IMO

[2:06:40] <+Damie904> Reggie needs a new weapon before he tries this. He did a backstab and I cant even tell if he did damage.
[2:06:44] <andre11dr> Good old Sarumon The Last Of the OGs LUL
[2:06:44] <%IronOhki> Backstab go up.

[2:06:49] <+Rafraud> He wouldn't get three drops, would he?
[2:06:53] <+terry_quest> try your fireballs
[2:06:55] <DXLelouch24> Reggie just needs to nuke him with fire and he wins
[2:06:56] <+Catpurnicus> kiting him around the fountain works pretty well though
[2:06:57] <TheRaubvogel> Can't even kill the hollow with that backstab dang
[2:06:58] <bacon_209> use a better weapon
[2:07:00] <andre11dr> SMASHED
[2:07:00] <wantedsafe471> If reggie gets the BKG I'll be both mad and happy he'll have a awesome weapon
[2:07:00] <elshadow7> Havel's gonna be fun
[2:07:02] <%hax_metatron> I love how Souls fights sometimes are like window-shopping. This COOL ASS gear could be yours!!!
[2:07:02] <+terry_quest> worked on the BKS knight
[2:07:06] <+Deekman> did they increase the BK aggro distance? I thought he backed off at the bottom of the spire stairs
[2:07:08] <elshadow7> Hope he's got a better axe by then
[2:07:10] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @terry_quest on a black knight?
[2:07:14] <%trigunstar26> 5
[2:07:17] <+anoldtoilet> lol
[2:07:18] <AvroEltz> 2 hand the axe at least
[2:07:20] <DXLelouch24> should fireball after backstab
[2:07:20] <+anoldtoilet> thats not a great axe

[2:07:51] <leomuratore> @andre11dr No, and he lost his souls
[2:07:54] <%Ensign_Epic> small weapons without a crit mod aren't great for backstabs, doubly so if unupgraded
[2:07:55] <moonmintparadise> this is like the 4th time reggie healed and got an overhead
[2:07:56] <slothtouchingcloth> If only there was somewhere to upgrade his weapon LUL

[2:12:40] <Solidnick18> you have a shit axe
[2:12:40] <+anoldtoilet> or just go 16 str so you can one hand the claymore
[2:12:40] <thefreakmuseum> who needs str
[2:12:43] <PlagueOfGripes> did he ever kill the first black knight at the blue tearstone
[2:12:45] <+askalta> he needs to hit dex min to two hand black knight sword
[2:12:46] <+anoldtoilet> and 2h bks later
[2:12:46] <bacon_209> or use a better weapon
[2:12:47] <GeoGio3> he needs dex for some quality weapons but he needs str

[2:13:22] <%guiltyboya> Pyromancy makes you a [BIG SHOT]
[2:13:32] <Admiral_PopnFresh> thanks armor
[2:13:33] <+terry_quest> something like the Claymore he can use now
[2:13:37] <RyuuAoi> They won't let him use the ax @plagueofgripes
[2:13:39] <@Solidus_113> you'll never have enough life
[2:13:40] <DXLelouch24> should kill the shopkeep he has a nice weapon for ya
[2:13:46] <elshadow7> Vit is a very appealing stat for first time players
[2:13:47] <%thetunnelhomer> Oooh yea. He'd have the claymore right now
[2:13:49] <elshadow7> Makes you feel safer
[2:14:00] <elshadow7> But dmg is the better option when you know the game
[2:14:03] <%thetunnelhomer> Man, getting nostalgic over weapons is super easy
[2:14:04] <+Catpurnicus> he has the claymore
[2:14:07] <PlagueOfGripes> two handed black knight axe is so good
[2:14:09] <velgaduere> the illusion of saefty
[2:14:10] <%ken_kuma> Woolie really is the bean dad of fire bombs
[2:14:11] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[2:14:11] <%Ensign_Epic> leveling too much VIT is a bit of a newbie trap, huh
[2:14:12] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Upgrade priority is always Weapon>lvl up>armor
[2:14:12] <+anoldtoilet> reggie r2
[2:14:12] <%X2Eliah> wow
[2:14:12] <velgaduere> safety too
[2:14:12] <+Catpurnicus> he hasn't tried it yet
[2:14:14] <GeoGio3> stop doing stingers
[2:14:14] <LordlayerO> lul
[2:14:16] <MightyOwl95> TRIPLE KICK!
[2:14:16] <Solidnick18> LUL LUL LUL
[2:14:18] <QueequegTheater> Woolie's approach to teaching is apparently "Literally never take risks.  A risk means Santa will kill your parents."
[2:14:18] <%baka_sugoi> LUL
[2:14:19] <Kekama> member when woolie would only use that worthless stick
[2:14:19] <+anoldtoilet> your r2 is a vertical
[2:14:20] <+liquidzr0> shofuMillyrock
[2:14:21] <Deko_> LUL

[2:14:29] <%IronOhki> Kick = Up Smash
[2:14:34] <%Lion_kun> Try R2
[2:14:35] <Sleepsie_> I couldn't get 3 kicks in a row if I tried naroXD
[2:14:46] <andre11dr> Nice
[2:14:46] <bacon_209> test a better weapon
[2:14:53] <+Catpurnicus> has he hit R2 once?
[2:15:02] <GeoGio3> try some different weapons
[2:15:08] <+extradopeness> woolie (partizan) madden
[2:15:10] <andre11dr> Also i think he forgot he haa R2s LUL
[2:15:11] <+anoldtoilet> i dont think hes hit r2 once, no
[2:15:12] <velgaduere> r1 r1 r1? r1 r1 r1.
[2:15:12] <PlagueOfGripes> Reggie's damage is pretty pitiful though
[2:15:16] <+vaderxyz1970> Just came back he got the helmet drop!?!
[2:15:21] <%Ensign_Epic> I killed a dude with kicks once. They were clearly new to the game & I felt awful after XD
[2:15:21] <AncyentMarinere> He never did try the longsword
[2:15:30] <%hax_metatron> They know you're the greatest threat, you're willing to cheese enemies. They are scared of you
[2:15:30] <%IronOhki> @vaderxyz1970 And he clutched out the Black Knight.
[2:15:30] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:15:34] <glass_marcus> what better weapon does even have that he has stats for?
[2:15:40] <+Catpurnicus> Claymore
[2:15:43] <„Éè„ÇØ„Ç¢> claymore
[2:15:44] <elshadow7> Claymore
[2:15:45] <+Catpurnicus> he can use the claymore right now
[2:15:46] <@Solidus_113> he could 2H claymore
[2:15:47] <%X2Eliah> @glass_marcus none, he needs stats
[2:15:47] <%thetunnelhomer> Clayless
[2:15:48] <bacon_209> morning star
[2:15:49] <+Catpurnicus> if he 2H it
[2:15:55] <QueequegTheater> Clayoccasionally
[2:15:56] <PlagueOfGripes> oh he got the claymore? aka the best overall weapon in the series?
[2:16:03] <elshadow7> Yeah, the morning star is straight up better, isn't it?
[2:16:06] <+McSoliace> he's not going to two hand
[2:16:07] <glass_marcus> I think's he not comfortable enough to start two handing
[2:16:08] <@Solidus_113> 2H requires no cowardice
[2:16:09] <%CaptainPileDriver> hey, i'm back, what's happened since i left
[2:16:09] <%thetunnelhomer> Yes, the best weapon in the series the claymore
[2:16:11] <+Catpurnicus> he also has some swords and spears
[2:16:12] <%guiltyboya> CLAYMORE :^)
[2:16:14] <Rawbone_saw> @PlagueOfGripes yes right away and he never even tried it out
[2:16:14] <%Lion_kun> Best weapon in the game is BKS.
[2:16:15] <velgaduere> @PlagueOfGripes nah but this woodchopping axe tho
[2:16:18] <+rubeSandwich> This claymore could start a religion
[2:16:21] <+Sir_Louis> At little clay more a little axe less maybe
[2:16:24] <andre11dr> Yeah he can 2H a Claymore but that means playing with no shield, Reggie ain't doing that LUL
[2:16:24] <%CateHecate> Fore and Starboard
[2:16:25] <%IronOhki> Oh my god Woolie
[2:16:29] <%glaciomaniak> he could technically go get the uchi as well
[2:16:31] <%CaptainPileDriver> i left right as reggie unlocked that bonfire under the dragon, anything i miss
[2:16:33] <+Catpurnicus> someone please ask woolie to remind him R2 exists
[2:16:36] <%Ensign_Epic> claymore stans malding rn still

[2:16:46] <RyuuAoi> Does Reggie have a good roll rn?
[2:16:47] <%trigunstar26> he killed silver knight
[2:16:49] <Solidnick18> yes please
[2:16:59] <Solidnick18> damage good
[2:17:03] <%CaptainPileDriver> @CaptainPileDriver okay, cool
[2:17:06] <bacon_209> better weapon
[2:17:06] <%CappuccinoGuil> Woolz, he could save it since THAT NPC is coming around the corner.
[2:17:10] <RickyRelucent> bUT WHaTs mOrE ImPoRtANt
[2:17:13] <+twohitgood> needs to level strength to actually get that damage up.
[2:17:14] <+mechslayer71> woolie, don't you remember pats advice? strength and dex are worthless!
[2:17:16] <RickyRelucent> lvls or upgrades$
[2:17:17] <velgaduere> @Ensign_Epic damage stans in general tbh
[2:17:20] <PlagueOfGripes> it would be funny if he ended up loving the halberd
[2:17:24] <+McSoliace> he also has a bunch of weapons in his box
[2:17:32] <elshadow7> Yeah, Andrew is nearby too
[2:17:34] <elshadow7> more options
[2:17:38] <velgaduere> man the halberd's my favorite
[2:17:39] <+Catpurnicus> he has the estoc as well
[2:17:41] <+anoldtoilet> R2
[2:17:43] <+Sir_Louis> Bring on the toothpick baby lets go
[2:17:45] <+anoldtoilet> Is a vertical
[2:17:48] <%IronOhki> @velgaduere Mine too
[2:17:48] <QueequegTheater> Woolie is now giving out advice that actively sabotages Reggie
[2:17:51] <andre11dr> Man ,Woolies coaching is really overbearing or confusing this time around huh? DeS was definitely not like this
[2:17:52] <+extradopeness> still cant get over the SK fight that was a 3 ring circus
[2:17:53] <Kalcom> does he know
[2:17:53] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I can never resist using the titanite catchpole if it drops
[2:17:56] <%Ensign_Epic> Hand axe is weird, you sorta gotta treat it more like a straight sword than an axe because of the R1s lacking the overswing
[2:17:57] <+Catpurnicus> R2
[2:17:58] <%IronOhki> @QueequegTheater I too am noticing this.
[2:18:00] <RickyRelucent> If he gets a balder swag sword, we know what the weapon choice will be
[2:18:01] <%7thsloth> Oh shit almost time for the first real boss
[2:18:01] <+terry_quest> he is so fucked once he reaches the gargoyle gauntlet
[2:18:02] <+swesterly> Probably just pump health or stam for the next 30 levels Kappa
[2:18:03] <RickyRelucent> and also the build
[2:18:04] <user_naim> @queequegtheater as is tradition i guess
[2:18:06] <+twohitgood> for how reggie plays, you're gonna want to get him into a strength build and a nice, stable shield.
[2:18:20] <@Solidus_113> a stable shield to coward behind
[2:18:26] <„Éè„ÇØ„Ç¢> dont think reggie is prepare to abandon shield and start 2handing weapons but he could at least try after getting the next bonfire
[2:18:26] <GeoGio3> liar? nah
[2:18:30] <+wynnewake> thinking emoji
[2:18:30] <PlagueOfGripes> the sooner you can pile poise onto reggie the better
[2:18:30] <%trigunstar26> LIAR
[2:18:35] <elshadow7> 2H BKH build lets goo!
[2:18:44] <Deko_> monkaS
[2:18:44] <QueequegTheater> I just want Reggie to parry once and then immediately start disregarding Woolie's advice
[2:18:46] <%Lion_kun> If Reggie can upgrade to a decent weapon, he should he fine.
[2:18:52] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> LUL
[2:18:52] <+Catpurnicus> he knows about parrying
[2:18:54] <%Ensign_Epic> Nah not BKH, Gargoyle Halberd
[2:18:55] <RickyRelucent> waste tbh
[2:18:55] <user_naim> I‚Äôm pretty happy with Woolie‚Äôs coaching tho.
[2:18:56] <RickyRelucent> w/e

[2:19:23] <elshadow7> Well
[2:19:23] <+extradopeness> hey woolie is no slouch
[2:19:23] <velgaduere> so about that damage...
[2:19:27] <QueequegTheater> @Catpurnicus Every time it comes up, Woolie shoots down the idea with "BUT IF YOU MISS, YOUR ENTIRE FAMILY LINE WILL PERISH IN AGONY"
[2:19:27] <royb2> they got the SWAF
[2:19:28] <user_naim> Ballin‚Äô, but at what cost?
[2:19:29] <bruuzer12> Baller Knights
[2:19:31] <+SenorCounter> backing into unknown
[2:19:33] <+Catpurnicus> I have to say, the fact that reggie goes to fireballs for tough enemies is awesome
[2:19:34] <PlagueOfGripes> this is the weakest boy in the balder bunch
[2:19:34] <%CateHecate> DROP YOUR BOW
[2:19:35] <elshadow7> Everyone HATES fire

[2:19:57] <+wynnewake> FIRE BOMB BAYBEE
[2:19:57] <PlagueOfGripes> can't wait for the parry discovery
[2:20:00] <%vVAstrAVv> TAKE THE BOW.... OFF
[2:20:00] <+twohitgood> @Solidus_113 yep. BK shield is good but i find getting a leveled up kite shield is a great amount of stability to how little weight it is (+14 is 71 sta for 3 weight).
[2:20:02] <QueequegTheater> For real, parry this guy
[2:20:03] <GeoGio3> parry this
[2:20:04] <Deasmeister> 1 damage would've been a while at the dragon
[2:20:06] <%DoctorHam> yeetus bow-eetus
[2:20:09] <Deko_> yeyeye
[2:20:11] <+liquidzr0> jesus
[2:20:13] <+SenorCounter> turn around
[2:20:13] <GeoGio3> shield

[2:20:14] <andre11dr> LUL
[2:20:14] <%CodenameChaz> Those panic button presses
[2:20:16] <+Reverend_Roscoe> take off the bow, dang

[2:20:21] <peachy996> Real toasty
[2:20:25] <%Rafoki> YOU GOT THIS BAULDER KNIGHT!
[2:20:26] <+TheFrancix> will he get lucky and get the baller swag sword?
[2:20:29] <shakespearo> unequip bow or perish
[2:20:30] <+ColonelHandzLanza> death means nothing, parry everything
[2:20:31] <%hax_metatron> Enjoy those views Reggie
[2:20:32] <+extradopeness> sheesh that poke bowl was GOOD
[2:20:35] <fancybac0n> I can't wait for the real parry test: Havel
[2:20:35] <%Josef_Stryker> That shield sucks
[2:20:37] <%hax_metatron> That is one of my favorite balconies
[2:20:38] <GeoGio3> take that bow off
[2:20:39] <andre11dr> Woolie should really tell him to take the bow off
[2:20:42] <PlagueOfGripes> worse than existing shield technically
[2:20:43] <+askalta> way too heavy
[2:20:43] <elshadow7> I wonder how many people used parries on first playthrough, I sure didn't. Ever.
[2:20:45] <nxflre> no way he'll get 3 lucky drops back to back
[2:20:48] <Estuko> ‚ô• how's the adventur.e going
[2:20:51] <+TheFrancix> yooo plauge
[2:21:01] <+extradopeness> fkn poseur shield
[2:21:01] <user_naim> Just put more bows on. Mod in the 3 weapon slots on each hand
[2:21:07] <+druupy_> No woolie shouldn‚Äôt tell him about the bow LUL
[2:21:08] <QueequegTheater> @Estuko NotLikeThis
[2:21:10] <nxflre> remove bow since it fucked you up
[2:21:18] <%krispen_wa> imagine playing the game with mid-rolls

[2:22:09] <+extradopeness> reggie versus green flask
[2:22:11] <%krispen_wa> imagine bowing instead of pointing down
[2:22:13] <%CappuccinoGuil> Make a bow build, just to spite us
[2:22:13] <%CateHecate> full life consequences
[2:22:14] <%Irridium> @elshadow7 then let him perish
[2:22:15] <%DoctorHam> B O W
[2:22:15] <xXVeggiePLusXx> Did we talk about how the bell ringing in the background comes from other players?
[2:22:15] <%hax_metatron> Use a bone
[2:22:16] <Monkeyweed21> SNAILLIE
[2:22:19] <%Deekman> it's right there though
[2:22:20] <PlagueOfGripes> reggie will die right here if he proceeds
[2:22:22] <QueequegTheater> Woolie is a noted coward though
[2:22:23] <%Ensign_Epic> there we go, no shame in the bonfire run
[2:22:27] <%Josef_Stryker> Reggie will probably love DS2 fo how generous they are will healing items Kappa
[2:22:28] <royb2> Snailborne eh
[2:22:32] <andre11dr> Nah let it go chat, eventually he'll learn
[2:22:32] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:22:35] <nxflre> @xXVeggiePLusXx pretty sure wools is waiting til after he rings it
[2:22:35] <%Josef_Stryker> *with
[2:22:37] <%chief_chongo> woolieKICKDAD_SG
[2:22:39] <%Mushinronja> Tactical
[2:22:42] <RickyRelucent> he might aswell, if he upgrades the next bonfire once
[2:22:44] <elshadow7> Hey, we all did this, it is the way.
[2:22:44] <emptyantics> @PlagueOfGripes Love you Plague
[2:22:46] <velgaduere> you're not being a coward, you're playing Dark Souls, baby
[2:22:47] <+TheFrancix> tactical bone
[2:22:49] <%CateHecate> lol, i thought for sure we were going to get to capra or at least gargs this stream, how foolish i was LUL
[2:22:54] <andre11dr> Snail Souls time
[2:22:55] <%IronOhki> GATE
[2:23:03] <%Josef_Stryker> It's only been 2 hours
[2:23:03] <PlagueOfGripes> dark 1 is more of a resource game, so choosing to go back with souls and knowledge is a good move
[2:23:03] <%IronOhki> AAAHHHH
[2:23:07] <Estuko> @andre11dr Several years ago on the ps3 I watched my friend approach the bridge, equip shields in both hands and gave the most confident self assuring nod at his idea and booked it forward. Anything involving the off hand is a good adventure to me lol
[2:23:07] <%Josef_Stryker> We may yet get a boss
[2:23:08] <elshadow7> @CateHecate We'll get gargs...right?
[2:23:12] <nxflre> @CateHecate yeahhhh sure taking  abit but lots of good clips
[2:23:12] <+extradopeness> cowardice is a mission statement of the WoolieVS brand
[2:23:13] <Aqualord364> Levellllll
[2:23:14] <Darren716> I'm betting we don't get a single boss done this ses
[2:23:17] <QueequegTheater> @CateHecate Never underestimate this channel's ability to drag things out
[2:23:18] <+vaderxyz1970> HE GOT THAT BONFIRE
[2:23:19] <%holydeviant1> Getting lost on a wide single road
[2:23:19] <%hax_metatron> CLAYMORE
[2:23:20] <Nogopharo> Running past everything is a valid option
[2:23:21] <velgaduere> @IronOhki u good bro
[2:23:21] <DXLelouch24> its only 2:36 chat we got time calm down
[2:23:25] <%hax_metatron> LETS GO
[2:23:25] <%chief_chongo> what bosses has reggie beat, chat?
[2:23:30] <sirrice77> Woolie only knows the way of the snail and thus its the only thing he can teach
[2:23:32] <Darren716> Because I feel he'll do all darkroot and shit first
[2:23:34] <user_naim> @estuko that‚Äôs great
[2:23:38] <QueequegTheater> @chief_chongo lmao
[2:23:42] <%vVAstrAVv> pls take off bow
[2:23:43] <PlagueOfGripes> maybe don't wear the gigantic heavy boar head.
[2:23:47] <moonmintparadise> HE HAS THE BLACK KNIGHT SWORD ???
[2:23:53] <PlagueOfGripes> unless memes are important. then wear it
[2:23:53] <%IronOhki> @PlagueOfGripes Maybe a lot of things right now.
[2:23:59] <QueequegTheater> @PlagueOfGripes Cowardice
[2:24:00] <nxflre> @moonmintparadise yup he killed the knight and got it
[2:24:02] <RyuuAoi> @plagueofgripes But fashion Souls
[2:24:02] <LittleBigQuebec> Prospoturus , wear the boar helm
[2:24:03] <%Irridium> black knight sword and boar head first time yep
[2:24:04] <TheRaubvogel> I never put anything away, I just carry it all with me. Never got me into trouble.
[2:24:04] <%krispen_wa> Nah, he fashion souls over all
[2:24:08] <%thetunnelhomer> Gigantic boar helmet is BIS
[2:24:17] <andre11dr> @plagueofgripes Nah he needs that to assert his dominance
[2:24:18] <Johannen> Longsword babeeee
[2:24:21] <user_naim> I‚Äôm down for a no dex pig archer run
[2:24:26] <PlagueOfGripes> soldier's waistcloth is legit one of the best armor pieces in the game due to the poise to weight ratio
[2:24:30] <PlagueOfGripes> he only has warrior though
[2:24:31] <elshadow7> Keep one of everything, you're not going to be quick switching in the middle of battle, so why not?
[2:24:33] <moonmintparadise> the box is useless you dont have carry weight anyway
[2:24:38] <+liquidzr0> @chief_chongo the first two
[2:24:43] <Aqualord364> You can two hand it already
[2:24:46] <+TopTieramisu> a clean inventory is for pvpers that need to swap weapons depending on the situation
[2:24:48] <+69memegod420> black knight sword!
[2:24:48] <%krispen_wa> soldier wastecloth also lets you see FEET
[2:24:50] <%hax_metatron> He can two hand it already
[2:24:51] <+Catpurnicus> he can 2 hand it now
[2:24:53] <QueequegTheater> Poor Reggie, not only is Woolie accidentally giving him bad advice, half of chat is doing it on purpose for memes
[2:24:54] <Aqualord364> The calc for 2 handing is STR x 1.5
[2:24:54] <+Catpurnicus> he's good
[2:24:55] <+extradopeness> speaking wisdom
[2:24:55] <velgaduere> it says 10
[2:24:56] <RickyRelucent> i vote fang boar helmet only + claymore
[2:24:57] <%chief_chongo> shotoBless
[2:25:02] <Kalcom> good math
[2:25:05] <noxeturna> Where's Spy when we need Bacon Man Pt. II?
[2:25:06] <RickyRelucent> lets introduce reggie to quickrolls
[2:25:16] <PlagueOfGripes> damn that's a lot of good swords to choose from
[2:25:16] <Nogopharo> unequip bow
[2:25:22] <elshadow7> 88
[2:25:37] <%IronOhki> @RickyRelucent Nude Pig Build, classy.
[2:25:37] <%guiltyboya> Did someone just say Claymore? woolieGASM
[2:25:38] <Nogopharo> Plague not a mod
[2:25:41] <andre11dr> @queequegtheater Are you really trying to tell me memes don't help you beat the game? blasphemy
[2:25:43] <%chief_chongo> pizplexBonewheel woolieGASM pizplexBonewheel
[2:25:44] <user_naim> Pig dad
[2:25:45] <RyuuAoi> Reggie still might need his shield, y'all. He might not be ready.
[2:25:52] <vavilonica> duck sauce
[2:25:54] <%hax_metatron> LONGSWORD / CLAYMORE
[2:25:55] <QueequegTheater> @andre11dr Me, yes. Reggie, no.
[2:25:56] <%krispen_wa> STRAIGHT SWORD HILT RUN LETS GO
[2:25:58] <Kalcom> he can try
[2:25:59] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Jesus he literally has like 4 of the top 5 best swords already
[2:26:00] <%IronOhki> @user_naim Become Giant
[2:26:01] <RickyRelucent> @IronOhki I'd be rocking it with a club and steel/golem pieces
[2:26:01] <+Chimeraelite> Longsword moveset FUCKS
[2:26:08] <%jepupu> Both
[2:26:08] <RickyRelucent> but it'd be kinda neat for reggarth rn
[2:26:13] <%jepupu> Morningstar?
[2:26:20] <user_naim> @ironohki What bows you got bitch?
[2:26:27] <vavilonica> I see we pig heading, classic
[2:26:28] <QueequegTheater> NotLikeThis
[2:26:34] <%IronOhki> @user_naim What's your favorite Skyrim build and why is it stealth archer?
[2:26:39] <+BignanasTheGawd> just keep the weapons in your inven just incase
[2:26:39] <andre11dr> Long sword is really good
[2:26:46] <+Bitscreed> I had to step away for a bit. Has Reggie beaten the big sword boi yet?
[2:26:49] <+druupy_> He should get the reinforced club, it fucks
[2:26:51] <%jepupu> Morningstar is better than hand axe?
[2:26:53] <+Catpurnicus> try the morning star!
[2:26:59] <%krispen_wa> @bitscreed after lots of cheesing and at 1 hp
[2:26:59] <%glaciomaniak> !uptime
[2:26:59] <@Moobot> @glaciomaniak WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 37 minutes
[2:27:01] <PlagueOfGripes> morning star is also good since it has a bonus to stagger
[2:27:02] <user_naim> @ironohki well now i‚Äôm just getting called out lol
[2:27:06] <andre11dr> Like you can beat the game with the long sword no problem
[2:27:12] <+askalta> does he know equipment load isn't like demon's souls
[2:27:12] <Estuko> @user_naim It's ridiculous how the beginning of the game makes it hard to go anything else lol.
[2:27:14] <+extradopeness> the big stupid pig helmet is gonna set this run way back isnt it
[2:27:20] <Aqualord364> If you unequip the bow you can equip the leather gauntlets
[2:27:25] <%Artoo__The_Me> @plagueofgripes But also staggers if misses
[2:27:28] <%DoctorHam> B O W
[2:27:32] <+druupy_> Giant Club run or bust
[2:27:34] <+TheFrancix> BOW
[2:27:35] <%CappuccinoGuil> It's one bow being removed away
[2:27:40] <+Bitscreed> @krispen_wa I take it he wasn't lucky enough to get the greatsword?
[2:27:49] <elshadow7> Claymore's also heavier
[2:27:50] <@Solidus_113> Bio Organic Weapons
[2:27:57] <andre11dr> Reggie really loves that bow that he's making so much use off Kappa
[2:28:02] <Nogopharo> Finally
[2:28:02] <+swesterly> Take off the bow for extra weight
[2:28:05] <%jepupu> Just test the moveset first
[2:28:09] <Kalcom> he loves the shield
[2:28:11] <Kekama> blasphemy
[2:28:11] <Aqualord364> Claymore is beeg damage comparatively
[2:28:14] <PlagueOfGripes> one handed claymore is the perfect moveset
[2:28:14] <%Juriasu> only choice is BSS start farming
[2:28:19] <PlagueOfGripes> ignoring great scythes anyway
[2:28:20] <%hax_metatron> Time to fall in love with the Longsword R2
[2:28:21] <elshadow7> Ew 1H claymore DansGame
[2:28:22] <Johannen> Numbers dont tell you about the weapon, damage type and moveset does
[2:28:25] <user_naim> Aww, we‚Äôre abandoning bow-kun?
[2:28:25] <QueequegTheater> The bow adds weight and has actively almost gotten him killed already
[2:28:35] <RickyRelucent> bad, ur using shield and ur not hittin g 25% equip weight
[2:28:39] <velgaduere> hand axe only run ruined hotsamBad
[2:28:39] <Dopamien> he was holding it so he could become stronger, like ankle weights
[2:28:40] <RickyRelucent> but idc
[2:28:43] <RickyRelucent> :3
[2:28:45] <+SenorCounter> Moveset > Minor Damage increases
[2:28:52] <%jepupu> 2-hand it?
[2:28:53] <%holydeviant1> longsword doesn't stagger on miss, has a versatile moveset
[2:28:57] <andre11dr> Pls god no BSS this playground, pls baby Jesus
[2:29:02] <DSD24> I see Reggarth is the Boar Knight now
[2:29:06] <user_naim> @queequegtheater Yeah but what if he needs it /s
[2:29:07] <RickyRelucent> well get into gear, and fashion souls
[2:29:08] <elshadow7> Pop souls, get another level
[2:29:12] <RickyRelucent> and quickrolling
[2:29:18] <%CappuccinoGuil> Dex if you want to wield BKS
[2:29:20] <RickyRelucent> shield is best fren
[2:29:25] <RickyRelucent> low effort
[2:29:27] <RickyRelucent> c :
[2:29:33] <+Catpurnicus> he's not going to get to BKS anytime soon
[2:29:33] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1455421207659139081?t=Np244HCpRXfSBOkB2__Gpw&s=19
[2:29:36] <Kalcom> str if you wanna use BKS too
[2:29:40] <LimitBreak_J> @DSD24 Boar Knight Reggarth. I like it.
[2:29:45] <+extradopeness> i would build for BKS bit this aint my game or stream
[2:29:46] <+Catpurnicus> also he hasn't tried 2H yet
[2:29:48] <Deasmeister> Pop enough for two and claymore can be used
[2:29:55] <GeoGio3> Yehyehyeh
[2:29:56] <%CappuccinoGuil> Being able to pop multiple souls is by far the main reason to get the Remaster, holy shit
[2:29:56] <QueequegTheater> DO IT
[2:29:59] <elshadow7> Just sayin'
[2:30:01] <RickyRelucent> claymore cna alrdy be used
[2:30:02] <+askalta> do it
[2:30:03] <RickyRelucent> if twohanded
[2:30:05] <%Irridium> claymore's real solid
[2:30:07] <RickyRelucent> needs like 9str
[2:30:09] <QueequegTheater> At 16 you can 2 hand the claymore
[2:30:10] <Aqualord364> 12 dex is enough to wield most weapons
[2:30:10] <warpiscute> NotLikeThis
[2:30:12] <RickyRelucent> if ur gonna twohand it only
[2:30:14] <DSD24> @LimitBreak_J Once he gets a better chest piece he's gonna look way cooler
[2:30:14] <velgaduere> lobosKek
[2:30:15] <%Lion_kun> It is 3x stronger than the axe
[2:30:16] <QueequegTheater> WOOLIE WHY
[2:30:19] <%trigunstar26> nt enough. maybe you should pop those humanities Kappa
[2:30:22] <Darren716> Become Drew McIntyre, use the clay
[2:30:22] <velgaduere> Chatroom: Civil War
[2:30:22] <%krispen_wa> >Leveling dex
[2:30:23] <andre11dr> Reggie might really beat the game with the boar helm LUL
[2:30:27] <Kalcom> woolie must control him
[2:30:27] <Deko_> NotLikeThis
[2:30:28] <elshadow7> It's fine guys, all stats are good at this point (except res)
[2:30:29] <sendart> if he gets 16 he could aslo ZWEI
[2:30:29] <+Catpurnicus> STR and DEX doesn't let you hit harder unless you have amazing scaling
[2:30:35] <+swesterly> You get  a few hundred every time the dragon burns the enemies on the bridge if you want a quick simple farm for a few easy levels
[2:30:38] <+Catpurnicus> better/upgraded weapons is the path forward
[2:30:44] <RickyRelucent> unless the scaling is B+ is not worth
[2:30:47] <Aqualord364> You need 12 dex to Zwei, don't forget
[2:30:55] <RickyRelucent> esppecially if it has 2 or more dmg types
[2:30:56] <DSD24> He needs 16 Strength for the Giant Dad set
[2:30:58] <%Ensign_Epic> @Catpurnicus they haven't even hit andre yet
[2:31:00] <+Catpurnicus> STR/DEX is for prereqs at this point
[2:31:03] <elshadow7> Getting dex up to the minimum is always good
[2:31:08] <sendart> zweihander only needs 10 dex
[2:31:10] <RickyRelucent> scaling changes when upgraded
[2:31:11] <RickyRelucent> sometimes
[2:31:13] <%krispen_wa> getting dex up is always bad
[2:31:17] <RickyRelucent> some weapons have a or s scaling
[2:31:18] <Aqualord364> Was it 10? I'm thinking of a different sword then
[2:31:19] <user_naim> Elden Ring 2 better bring back power stancing
[2:31:19] <QueequegTheater> @sendart psaWrong psaWrong psaWrong psaWrong
[2:31:19] <+Catpurnicus> I do like pumping STR to use the Zwei early though
[2:31:20] <RickyRelucent> but those are rare
[2:31:31] <QueequegTheater> @sendart oh shit whoops
[2:31:32] <+Catpurnicus> pancake machine
[2:31:34] <%krispen_wa> NOW BECOME GIANT
[2:31:37] <Aqualord364> Scaling always gets higher with upgrades @RickyRelucent
[2:31:39] <QueequegTheater> I thought he said str
[2:31:39] <Xaeveax> DO IT
[2:31:40] <elshadow7> Time for real hits
[2:31:42] <Kalcom> sure love the bow
[2:31:43] <RickyRelucent> 8 str to twohand
[2:31:44] <RickyRelucent> DO IT
[2:31:45] <w_khan> Dex and strengh up is always good even to 30, you will have enoughto go magik or faith if you want too
[2:31:46] <sendart> @QueequegTheater lol
[2:31:49] <+askalta> try it
[2:31:50] <@Solidus_113> look at that sheath
[2:31:52] <GeoGio3> Claymoooooore my sweet baby
[2:31:53] <+HelloImTom08> BECOME POWERFUL
[2:31:53] <DSD24> Claymore has the cool sheath on the back
[2:31:54] <Xaeveax> Here we go!
[2:31:54] <warpiscute> yessss finally
[2:31:55] <elshadow7> I think he likes it
[2:31:56] <RickyRelucent> fang boar only with clay
[2:31:57] <@Solidus_113> woolieGASM

[2:32:08] <+Catpurnicus> yeyeyeyeyeye
[2:32:10] <elshadow7> PHAT
[2:32:10] <%krispen_wa> The Claymore, everyone's first love
[2:32:13] <%hax_metatron> Claymore REALLY shines in its 1 hand moveset IMO
[2:32:13] <Solidnick18> heavy
[2:32:13] <elshadow7> BOAR HELMET
[2:32:13] <%Indigo_Automaton> Take off the shield
[2:32:14] <Aqualord364> Just change up your armor
[2:32:14] <elshadow7> OFF
[2:32:15] <elshadow7> NOW
[2:32:16] <Deko_> LUL
[2:32:17] <LunarRemix> Playing heavy is a playstyle
[2:32:18] <QueequegTheater> IT'S FINE
[2:32:18] <%IronOhki> Trade for hat.
[2:32:18] <andre11dr> He really likes the boar helmet you guys

[2:32:25] <QueequegTheater> FATROLLING IS FINE MY GUY

[2:32:27] <%thetunnelhomer> Drop the shield
[2:32:28] <PlagueOfGripes> get rid of that stupid boar helmet
[2:32:28] <RickyRelucent> and ofc r1 spam
[2:32:28] <BigYanno> the helm is WAY too big
[2:32:28] <Solidnick18> Boar helm
[2:32:29] <+druupy_> Yea this is hot
[2:32:30] <Darren716> DROP YOUR SHIELD
[2:32:30] <OblivionSword1> maybe change the helmet

[2:32:33] <TigerClaws12> LUL already into fashion
[2:32:35] <BigYanno> Please take off the helm
[2:32:35] <Dopamien> become naked, keep helmet :)
[2:32:36] <%holydeviant1> man, everyone is so fearful of fatroll
[2:32:37] <%tank7013> Woolie wants him to use the Claymore so bad LUL

[2:34:59] <PlagueOfGripes> different trade in reward to snuggly
[2:35:00] <RickyRelucent> also, running, rolling, and backstepping attacks are pog
[2:35:01] <MrMatternot> Send h back to bonfire when he gets 02 soft humanity

[2:35:43] <RickyRelucent> yeah take off the shield, or lose some armor
[2:35:44] <+Catpurnicus> yeah at this point drop the shield lol
[2:35:46] <RickyRelucent> pls
[2:35:50] <+Axellogic> if hes not using the sheild he could save weight there
[2:35:54] <bacon_209> why are you blocking with a sword
[2:35:55] <+patriotrenegade> i hate how the arrow pouch and bolts pouch are overlapping
[2:36:00] <+TopTieramisu> the shield is for fashion
[2:36:02] <andre11dr> LUL
[2:36:04] <ronin19xx> Damn, utilizing the claymore as a shield, nice
[2:36:12] <PlagueOfGripes> important thing to note for VERY soon:: jumping R2s go through enemy parry stances
[2:36:13] <RickyRelucent> the shield does look good with that scabbard
[2:36:14] <elshadow7> 40 something?
[2:36:19] <elshadow7> Oh 60, meh
[2:36:20] <LegitBarnacleBoy> not bad either
[2:36:21] <+druupy_> No keep the shield, it looks cool

[2:36:26] <RickyRelucent> big ol round iron shield

[2:36:30] <user_naim> sub 100 blocking is still fine
[2:36:34] <%Indigo_Automaton> If you remove the shield you can use the extra carry weight for better armor pieces
[2:36:34] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:36:38] <ronin19xx> Nice dodge

[2:37:16] <peyodogo> swing or die
[2:37:21] <+Catpurnicus> something something shields engender passivity?
[2:37:22] <+SenorCounter> You got to the edge that was facing his wall
[2:37:22] <GeoGio3> Or just one hand back to the shield
[2:37:23] <Aqualord364> I'd recommend getting more comfortable with rolling
[2:37:31] <andre11dr> Reggie forgot he had a roll
[2:37:36] <sendart> get naked reggie

[2:37:59] <RickyRelucent> imo
[2:38:02] <+druupy_> One downside to 2Hing, he doesn‚Äôt have his fire bom- I mean pyromancy
[2:38:04] <elshadow7> He can still block with the shield, he just can't attack while 1 handing.
[2:38:09] <bacon_209> get rid of the sheild
[2:38:10] <RickyRelucent> kinda heavy on the equip load

[2:46:35] <%IronOhki> I enjoy that Claymore and Halberd are reverse of each other. They both sweep and poke, but on the reverse buttons.
[2:46:35] <DSD24> Its almost like how every game needs a Stinger

[2:47:40] <%trigunstar26> dude imagine his current set but with elite knight chest piece woolieGASM
[2:47:42] <%IronOhki> @elshadow7 I think he meant sweep and stab
[2:47:42] <Johannen> Yeah, only spears
[2:47:45] <Monkeyweed21> @trigunstar26 if you take the master key as deprived you can get a full set of gear from Valley of the Drakes and then you have a super balanced statline to build however yo want
[2:47:46] <%illtima> Reggie be like "Oh yeah, you're a fan of playing like a coward, right?"
[2:47:47] <Solidnick18> Kreygasm

[2:48:21] <+HelloImTom08> BALLER
[2:48:22] <%CappuccinoGuil> Baller Swag Knight yeyeyeyeye
[2:48:23] <%BallerSwagBro9k> THATS MY SHIELD
[2:48:25] <DSD24> Look how cool it looks!
[2:48:25] <Aqualord364> REALLY high stability
[2:48:26] <noxeturna> Halberd attacks have a "whiff" at the end of their animation if you miss, but if you hit, you skip that part animation. It's a risk reward pick, but very strong.
[2:48:28] <%vVAstrAVv> oh my god i thought it was the sword lol
[2:48:29] <+hexagonofdeath> lel
[2:48:29] <Aqualord364> You lose very little stamina using that shield
[2:48:33] <RickyRelucent> BEST stabilityy
[2:48:35] <+Shady_Zaku> PogChamp PogChamp vargFloss vargFloss vargDuane vargDuane vargDuane
[2:48:35] <radiorosewater> @BallerSwagBro9k THATS HIS SHIELD
[2:48:36] <+ThePich> BALLIN
[2:48:36] <%jepupu> Stability means how much stamina you lose on block
[2:48:37] <Monkeyweed21> @squirtkitten the bandit starting set is on the bridge in valley of the drakes
[2:48:37] <RickyRelucent> the poise of a shield
[2:48:38] <%Ensign_Epic> EYY BALLER SWAG SHIELD
[2:48:39] <RyuuAoi> We untouchable
[2:48:39] <+ManOfReason> He will never be ballin
[2:48:40] <%IronOhki> @BallerSwagBro9k Your time has come.
[2:48:43] <+TheOlMitcheroo> It's only baller shield, IT HAS NO SWAG
[2:48:43] <+hexagonofdeath> has reggie killed any of the black knights yet?
[2:48:46] <JetpackMcQuack> PogChamp get it?
[2:48:47] <%notsoy> perhaps the knights of baldur guarded...a gate?
[2:48:51] <elshadow7> L O R E
[2:48:52] <Aqualord364> He got both of the first ones @hexagonofdeath
[2:48:52] <BudderZilla> KNIGHT KING
[2:48:55] <@Solidus_113> stable as fuck
[2:48:58] <squirtkitten> @Monkeyweed21 oooh right i completely forgot, i was just focusing on the loot around the undead dragon
[2:49:00] <DSD24> The shield has Swag
[2:49:00] <sirrice77> @hexagonofdeath the very first one, got the sword too
[2:49:02] <%Indigo_Automaton> Yes
[2:49:03] <oda_flobunaga> YES
[2:49:04] <%Juriasu> stability is nice
[2:49:05] <+patriotrenegade> yes
[2:49:05] <+RemedyofRevenge> Yes it is
[2:49:06] <RickyRelucent> ti tanks one zweihander
[2:49:08] <%Irridium> YES
[2:49:09] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus That's a HUGE improvement in stability.
[2:49:10] <+hexagonofdeath> oh wow. luckily no black knight weapons have ruined the playthrough i guess
[2:49:11] <+RemedyofRevenge> over 60 stability is excellent
[2:49:12] <RickyRelucent> before being guardbroke
[2:49:15] <Admiral_PopnFresh> weight is the concern
[2:49:18] <+extradopeness> swag 100
[2:49:19] <Monkeyweed21> @trigunstar26 yea once you know where to find gear DS1 deprived is arguably the best starter for flexible builds
[2:49:22] <%trigunstar26> cooool
[2:49:31] <elshadow7> Mid-roll?
[2:49:31] <DSD24> It also looks rad as fuck

[2:49:45] <%Irridium> go full fat roll. embrace the chonk
[2:49:45] <%jepupu> If you wanna use that shield, you might as well use a morningstar or longsword
[2:49:52] <+ThePich> drop your pants
[2:49:53] <elshadow7> chest?
[2:49:54] <RickyRelucent> good
[2:49:54] <+HelloImTom08> save helmet, it  looks cool
[2:49:55] <RickyRelucent> its gud
[2:49:55] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YEYEYYEYEY
[2:49:56] <PlagueOfGripes> if only there was ONE heavy equipment piece to remove that would fix all his weight issues
[2:49:57] <RyuuAoi> Try out that Ha
[2:49:57] <+extradopeness> i LOVE the animation of the fat roll he just EATS SHIT lmao
[2:49:57] <Solidnick18> nice
[2:50:00] <Monkeyweed21> @squirtkitten the Astora Straight Sword is also great for Deprived because the undead asylum gives just enough souls to bump faith to 14
[2:50:02] <DSD24> Look how good that shield looks

[2:51:19] <JetpackMcQuack> These guys fuck
[2:51:19] <RickyRelucent> reggie abuse the running attack
[2:51:21] <%hax_metatron> Regular R2
[2:51:22] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Reggie bounced off of the buckler
[2:51:24] <andre11dr> Balling
[2:51:27] <+Catpurnicus> nah jump attack is fine
[2:51:27] <RickyRelucent> /backstep atk
[2:51:29] <+HelloImTom08> feel like he was doing better 2H
[2:51:30] <Johannen> Woolie sabotaging Reggie on all fronts
[2:51:31] <DSD24> Kick!
[2:51:31] <+Catpurnicus> I respect it
[2:51:35] <elshadow7> Jump attack is good tho
[2:51:36] <%hax_metatron> Use the regular R2 of the Claymore
[2:51:44] <+Catpurnicus> woollie, let him play risky
[2:51:45] <JetpackMcQuack> Let him touch the stove
[2:51:45] <PMda2nd> nah, more jumps
[2:51:48] <AvroEltz> The balder bros are not a boss, but quite a steep stair
[2:51:49] <N3310_> jump attack is ass like 99% of the time in this game
[2:51:51] <user_naim> Nah, it‚Äôs fine
[2:51:52] <%IronOhki> Nah, Forward R2 is fine because Reggie strong and not a coward.
[2:51:52] <elshadow7> Always be jump in
[2:51:55] <velgaduere> the SOULS are not DARK enough. sabotage is the solution
[2:51:56] <+Catpurnicus> play this game like a platformer
[2:51:57] <+Rafraud> I think reggie will pick up on unsafe shit more if you explain it like a fighting game

[2:52:12] <QueequegTheater> These souls aren't dark enough, we can't arrest them Kappa
[2:52:14] <glass_marcus> It's fine for the axe where you don't have much range in general, but you don't really need to close in with a claymore
[2:52:16] <+Catpurnicus> only thing I would change would be to switch to 2H for jumps
[2:52:25] <%Mushinronja> drop the fire bombs and lift your feet for jump attacks
[2:52:27] <%Rafoki> come on baller knight get that parry
[2:52:33] <+Catpurnicus> he was doing so much better against these dudes with 2H jumps lol

[3:02:46] <velgaduere> yeah... I wonder...........
[3:02:50] <Solidnick18> he smiths very fast
[3:02:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> I hit swords
[3:03:01] <@Solidus_113> extremely hihg speed
[3:03:02] <a_mad_dragon_> R E I N F O R C E
[3:03:02] <+extradopeness> Incredible hihg speed
[3:03:04] <+patriotrenegade> He's here to blacksmith without a smelter
[3:03:08] <+RemedyofRevenge> Moving mouth PogChamp
[3:03:08] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @solidnick18 HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
[3:03:11] <user_naim> at very hihg speed
[3:03:18] <+eanscrale> it's a miracle he can smith anything without a forge, but he do
[3:03:18] <%IronOhki> They never betray you.
[3:03:20] <%Seancicle> KPOPvictory
[3:03:23] <Treasure_Vault> Hitting that sword prevents him from ever going hollow, so...
[3:03:24] <%IronOhki> Andre is actually the best.
[3:03:24] <yunglung> godo
[3:03:25] <w_khan> What did he use to smith his hammer?
[3:03:28] <Solidnick18> @BallerSwagBro9k i love the video LUL
[3:03:30] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @stormhawk9891
[3:03:32] <Visorak6> Until elden ring when a weapon animates and tries to kill you
[3:03:33] <Deasmeister> Wait.. his lips move I never noticed
[3:03:33] <SoaringTrumpet> and he will mess you up if you disrespect him
[3:03:35] <+ReallyBigRocks> he doesn't need a forge, he hits the sword so hard it gets hot
[3:03:43] <+vaderxyz1970> I've played Metal Gear I don't know about that
[3:03:46] <RickyRelucent> my sword is a dingus
[3:04:02] <DSD24> When you have a smith box you can break the game with the bottomless box glitch
[3:04:04] <AvroEltz> want to talk about best attacks in the game? you cant beat his dropkick
[3:04:08] <hookhis> @Deasmeister its a remaster thing
[3:04:09] <%IronOhki> He breaks it down so clearly.
[3:04:16] <RyuuAoi> Reggie try out the Halberd
[3:04:17] <+ReallyBigRocks> Consider ascension
[3:04:22] <andre11dr> I'm so glad YT new algorithm makes it so that Zulies content gets more noticed
[3:04:34] <Dopamien> @stormhawk9891 I see you, and üëç for the reference
[3:04:36] <SainEdge> @hookhis no its not
[3:04:39] <RickyRelucent> rn, u can onlyy get +5
[3:04:39] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:04:41] <bacon_209> enchant
[3:04:42] <justcallmebobplease> Modify is ALSO tiering up, like 5 to 6, or 10 to 11
[3:04:50] <%Juriasu> forging armor DansGame
[3:04:52] <@Solidus_113> never upgrade armour
[3:04:53] <+Rafraud> Has reggie asked about the bell yet
[3:04:55] <Monkeyweed21> its way simpler than DeS and its STILL overly complicated
[3:04:56] <hookhis> @SainEdge huh, they moved in the original?
[3:05:04] <DSD24> Going Hollow is cringe bro
[3:05:08] <%holydeviant1> Forging armor is only good if you PICK ONE SET FOREVER
[3:05:13] <hookhis> @SainEdge never noticed too then lol
[3:05:14] <+vaderxyz1970> doing it doing it doing it well
[3:05:17] <glass_marcus> Reinforcing Armor is an embarrassment of riches
[3:05:18] <%Indigo_Automaton> There's always better armor to swap to over time so upgrading armor is a waste of resources
[3:05:22] <velgaduere> heheh haHAA
[3:05:22] <PMda2nd> material
[3:05:31] <SainEdge> @hookhis yeah, probably because Andre was supposed to be an more important character. Really weird LUL
[3:05:37] <QueequegTheater> Upgrading armor is for NG+
[3:05:40] <gabs423456> They removed armor upgrading later right?
[3:05:41] <%CappuccinoGuil> By the end, you'll have a set one
[3:05:41] <a_mad_dragon_> armour upgrading is for ng+
[3:05:42] <RyuuAoi> Upgrade the boar head!
[3:05:45] <QueequegTheater> Or PvP
[3:05:45] <RickyRelucent> unthil ur weapon is either another type or rock
[3:05:51] <RickyRelucent> or is +14/15
[3:05:53] <RickyRelucent> if slab
[3:05:53] <QueequegTheater> @gabs423456 no
[3:05:56] <Johannen> Makes Number GO BIG
[3:05:56] <+ThePich> i upgraded the black iron set, no regrets
[3:05:59] <RickyRelucent> nnot worth upgrading gear
[3:05:59] <Aqualord364> Disagree, upgrading mid weight armor can make it naerly on par with heavy armor while saving a ton of weight @Indigo_Automaton
[3:06:00] <%CappuccinoGuil> It's a commitment, you gotta put a ring on the right one, Reggie
[3:06:03] <andre11dr> Upgrading armour is if you wanna PVP
[3:06:08] <%trigunstar26> you keep your shit on ng+ right?
[3:06:10] <gabs423456> Damn I swear you could not upgrade armor in DS2 or 3 lol
[3:06:11] <velgaduere> welp
[3:06:14] <%IronOhki> DAMAGE GO UP
[3:06:17] <PMda2nd> sword stronga
[3:06:19] <Aqualord364> You can't upgrade armor in DS3
[3:06:20] <GeoGio3> clay +2 lesgoo
[3:06:24] <Aqualord364> Which sucks because upgrading armor is cool
[3:06:27] <andre11dr> Sword go stronk
[3:06:35] <+cdrom321> @gabs423456 You can in DS2.
[3:06:35] <Dopamien> @gabs423456 you can in ds3, althought its kinda pointless
[3:06:42] <RickyRelucent> it all ends helping out though
[3:06:44] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[3:06:46] <gabs423456> Im getting some mixed responses here lol
[3:06:52] <user_naim> Just slide some titanite under your skin.
[3:06:53] <+Rafraud> Big brain reggie
[3:06:54] <RickyRelucent> ppl end up quite tonky with +110 gear and 99 humanity soft
[3:06:59] <xXVeggiePLusXx> Yeah it was a DeS thing too
[3:06:59] <RickyRelucent> +10*
[3:07:00] <Aqualord364> You cannot upgrade armor in Dark Souls 3. Straight up
[3:07:02] <stormhawk9891> You C Reggie
[3:07:02] <Johannen> You dont C?
[3:07:03] <a_mad_dragon_> scaling is a lie
[3:07:05] <andre11dr> I'm pretty sure it's completely pointless to upgrade armour in DS3
[3:07:09] <+SenorCounter> Baws!
[3:07:10] <DSD24> Don't tell the player things
[3:07:13] <+Rafraud> C's get degrees
[3:07:15] <+ReallyBigRocks> There's a number behind that C somewhere lmao
[3:07:15] <Monkeyweed21> @gabs423456 you can upgrade armor in 2 but its still pretty worthless
[3:07:19] <BurdRightsActivist> @andre11dr You can't upgrade armor in ds3
[3:07:23] <RickyRelucent> yes
[3:07:24] <%jepupu> you can 1-hand the halberd
[3:07:26] <@Solidus_113> 800 souls a shard from andre here
[3:07:28] <RyuuAoi> DROP THE CLAYMORE
[3:07:28] <Treasure_Vault> Try Zwei?
[3:07:30] <RickyRelucent> later u can buy chunks
[3:07:32] <RickyRelucent> off the giant
[3:07:37] <+MrKerb> MrKerb subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! Hope your enjoying Dark Souls Reggie
[3:07:41] <gabs423456> I see thanks for the info chat!
[3:07:46] <velgaduere> Reggie gonna check out my baby, I'm so happy
[3:07:55] <andre11dr> Or was it DS2 ? one of them i could swear you could upgrade the armour
[3:08:01] <RickyRelucent> stability
[3:08:04] <RickyRelucent> is upgraded
[3:08:06] <RickyRelucent> yup
[3:08:11] <peyodogo> stability matters the most after phys def
[3:08:11] <justlikehumans> you can upgrade in ds1 and 2, not in ds3
[3:08:12] <%Josef_Stryker> U can upgrade Armour in DS1 and DS2
[3:08:15] <%Josef_Stryker> Not DS3
[3:08:15] <+Bitscreed> @andre11dr You could definitely upgrade armour in DS2
[3:08:16] <gabs423456> I honestly prefer just weapon upgrading
[3:08:28] <@Solidus_113> ricky relax. you're a dozen hours too early on some of these hints
[3:08:29] <%Josef_Stryker> And you just drown in resources in DS2
[3:08:29] <gabs423456> Makes Fashion Souls more easy to do haha
[3:08:30] <%holydeviant1> Fun fact: In STALKER, you CAN pull off the "more than a hundred percent" trick, and heal yourself by sitting on a campfire.
[3:08:38] <QueequegTheater> UPGRADE IT
[3:08:42] <%Josef_Stryker> In DS1 you gotta farm like a motherfucker
[3:08:42] <velgaduere> twinkly...........
[3:08:42] <%Indigo_Automaton> Save the twinkling for weapons\
[3:08:43] <user_naim> DS2 armor upgrades were kind of worthwhile too, iirc. At least when you‚Äôre drowning in materials
[3:08:46] <QueequegTheater> UPGRADE BOAR
[3:08:50] <RickyRelucent> its almost never worth putting a slab into armor
[3:08:52] <RickyRelucent> keep for weapons
[3:08:59] <%BisoromiBear> fully upgraded sack when
[3:09:01] <andre11dr> Always upgrade your weapon before the armour
[3:09:03] <Monkeyweed21> they removed armor upgrading from Bloodborne on so DS3 doesnt have it
[3:09:05] <%Josef_Stryker> The only material that was a pain in the ass to farm was Twinkling Titanite in DS2
[3:09:07] <Aqualord364> Yeah I never put slabs into armor, but I hella upgrade it to at least +3
[3:09:08] <velgaduere> BIG VALUE
[3:09:09] <GeoGio3> 20k key too
[3:09:13] <%holydeviant1> Andre is an excellent dump for excess souls at this point in the game
[3:09:15] <bleugh> did he ring the bell yet
[3:09:23] <GeoGio3> +3
[3:09:24] <Johannen> +5
[3:09:24] <%FallenAngelZelos> FallenAngelZelos subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months! Using this LP to finally inspire me to beat the game myself. Good luck Reggie on your own game!
[3:09:24] <+ThePich> @bleugh lol no
[3:09:24] <%IronOhki> +5
[3:09:26] <nxflre> nope no bell
[3:09:26] <%Indigo_Automaton> +5
[3:09:27] <LunarRemix> +5
[3:09:27] <+HelloImTom08> Thr Boar Knight
[3:09:29] <+ReallyBigRocks> It's right there
[3:09:30] <RickyRelucent> he's gonna be at +333

[3:09:32] <royb2> Reads right there lmao
[3:09:32] <+ReallyBigRocks> lmao
[3:09:38] <PlagueOfGripes> +5, then +10, +15
[3:09:39] <RickyRelucent> +3 if he buys a few
[3:09:44] <RickyRelucent> how many does he have on him
[3:09:45] <Johannen> Its simple, +5/+10/+15
[3:09:47] <glass_marcus> +3 for armor I think
[3:09:48] <gabs423456> Weapons go up to 15 in this game right?
[3:09:54] <PlagueOfGripes> you can farm shards off the enemies around the church
[3:09:55] <%Indigo_Automaton> Yes
[3:09:57] <andre11dr> I think he has 2 shards
[3:10:00] <RickyRelucent> yeah but +100 and +115 are different embers
[3:10:03] <DapperCadavr> he said THE NAME

[3:10:08] <+ReallyBigRocks> Wonder who that guy is
[3:10:10] <justcallmebobplease> Definitely not an important key.
[3:10:10] <%hax_metatron> BibleThump
[3:10:16] <%mr_sups> You WILL need that
[3:10:18] <mesamus> hear abiut this cool guy
[3:10:24] <+JaseAdrift> THE COOLEST DOOD
[3:10:24] <RickyRelucent> ehh
[3:10:25] <%hax_metatron> Aww man, Dark Souls first playthrough memories flooding in
[3:10:27] <+ReallyBigRocks> I bet he's super lame and not cool at all
[3:10:28] <RickyRelucent> go kill the butterflyy
[3:10:29] <JetpackMcQuack> Nonsense
[3:10:29] <velgaduere> GOALS
[3:10:29] <+Rafraud> Are they planning to hit the dlc?
[3:10:30] <RickyRelucent> ez clap
[3:10:39] <andre11dr> Never heard of that guy
[3:10:41] <%Seancicle> woolieVS
[3:10:42] <justcallmebobplease> @mr_sups Don't forget the ladder near the hydra - technically you don't need the key.
[3:10:43] <%hax_metatron> @Rafraud Remastered has it as part of the game
[3:10:48] <+druupy_> @jaseadrift Obito?
[3:10:48] <velgaduere> @Rafraud idk why they wouldn't
[3:10:49] <+Rafraud> Boggers
[3:10:52] <+druupy_> LUL
[3:10:54] <Solidnick18> LUL
[3:10:57] <%cobalt_phoenix_> LUL
[3:10:59] <%hax_metatron> Is there ANYONE that thinks Woolie won't let Reggie see the DLC? LUL
[3:10:59] <radiorosewater> got bonked
[3:11:02] <Monkeyweed21> @mr_sups there's another path to Sif but thats not viable for a new player
[3:11:02] <PlagueOfGripes> 20k to open the door and farm dudes who follow you off ledges
[3:11:07] <velgaduere> ah yes, the legendary "WOOLAAAAAY"
[3:11:09] <Aaronc123425> pawktHAHA pawktHAHA
[3:11:10] <+Rafraud> Idk didn't know if the goal was gwyn or completion
[3:11:12] <%CappuccinoGuil> That's 36 dragon baits at the bridge, easy
[3:11:17] <RickyRelucent> only for the one that makes it +10
[3:11:17] <royb2> fine I'll do it myself
[3:11:17] <+JaseAdrift> @druupy_ HIM TO HE DID NOTHING WRONG KAPPA
[3:11:19] <RickyRelucent> or +15
[3:11:21] <zzNamttamzz> OR use souls to level up for the Black Knight Sword
[3:11:21] <Gorillawitz> Everybody's first playthrough fashion: Claymore, boar's head, all he needs is the elite knight set.
[3:11:22] <RickyRelucent> or +5
[3:11:26] <RickyRelucent> everyyything else is box
[3:11:32] <+sevorai> OBITO WAS A COOL GUYYYY
[3:11:35] <RyuuAoi> @plagueofgripes Spoilers, Plague! Ha
[3:11:37] <Vigogs> the other claymore
[3:11:40] <RickyRelucent> or even +1
[3:11:40] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:11:42] <RickyRelucent> if its ele stuff
[3:11:50] <RickyRelucent> holy
[3:11:53] <+robertoszek> Obito had a better arc than Sakura
[3:12:01] <GeoGio3> shorter claymore
[3:12:06] <+patriotrenegade> Sakura had an arc?
[3:12:07] <LunarRemix> Love me Battle Axe
[3:12:11] <RickyRelucent> uncy plague!
[3:12:14] <RickyRelucent> :3
[3:12:20] <%Indigo_Automaton> The idea that you can't thrust with a broadsword is so silly
[3:12:24] <%Indigo_Automaton> It has a tip
[3:12:26] <andre11dr> @robertoszek That's a low bar
[3:12:27] <velgaduere> hand axe: who are you?
[3:12:27] <AncyentMarinere> The better axe
[3:12:31] <GeoGio3> the axe he had had that
[3:12:33] <velgaduere> battle axe: I am you, but stronger
[3:12:36] <PlagueOfGripes> I'm so used to the battle axe being the starter weapon I forget this is how you get it
[3:12:40] <Monkeyweed21> I wish Obito wasnt written terribly where he's constantly talking and thinking about that girl he wanted to bang when he was 14
[3:13:10] <JetpackMcQuack> Get slapped
[3:13:16] <+patriotrenegade> I wish Naruto wasnt written terribly
[3:13:31] <DSD24> Aww yeah punch fists
[3:13:31] <AvroEltz> I always farm the randon undead for the battle axe, such a strong starter weapon
[3:13:32] <%IronOhki> Even on my first play through, that Halbert stagger almost never caused me a problem. If I died from an axe stagger, there were other bigger mistakes coming into play that got me dead.
[3:13:34] <andre11dr> @monkeyweed21 Oh God i forgot, this man started a war because he couldn't lose his virginity FailFish
[3:13:38] <+Catpurnicus> the Caestus for the rest of us
[3:13:40] <RickyRelucent> cestus, kaistus, kaestus
[3:13:44] <RickyRelucent> potato
[3:13:44] <%holydeviant1> Cestus runs are fun as hell
[3:13:47] <+Nexzu> punch til you win
[3:13:47] <RickyRelucent> potahto
[3:13:50] <+DarkKnightGrave> I miss the Bone Fist.
[3:13:52] <KumaTorey> As the old adage says: Buy a man eat fish, He day. Teach fish man, to a lifetime.
[3:13:54] <Aqualord364> Fist runs are fucking awful in DS1
[3:13:56] <Jimbobbity> Obito was using rin as an example of the world being shit, he didnt literally mean that he wanted to smash her still
[3:13:56] <RyuuAoi> Full caestus lp! Let's go!
[3:13:56] <Aqualord364> They're so bad
[3:13:57] <%DashXero> Punching is fun
[3:14:00] <PlagueOfGripes> yet
[3:14:02] <%holydeviant1> DS2 is the better game for punching
[3:14:03] <peyodogo> save it for 2
[3:14:07] <Monkeyweed21> FISTS ARE ONLY GOOD IN DS2
[3:14:09] <%IronOhki> @KumaTorey I am pleased by these specific words. Thank you.
[3:14:09] <Solidnick18> That was sick
[3:14:10] <%mr_sups> Unless you get the BONE FIST !
[3:14:11] <%Indigo_Automaton> God I hope there's a good fist weapon in Elden Ring
[3:14:12] <Slim_Lipid> they;re more like bitch slaps than punches LUL
[3:14:13] <Dopamien> I only kept it for parries to be fair
[3:14:14] <DXLelouch24> @WoolieVersus play Nioh 2 if you want to punch shit
[3:14:14] <Aqualord364> God I wish the fist weapons in this game weren't shit
[3:14:19] <@Solidus_113> Elden Ring better have good fists
[3:14:20] <problemagic> i hope everybody is having a good time!
[3:14:21] <RickyRelucent> dualwielding dragonbone smashers was fun, if kinda meme tier
[3:14:21] <PMda2nd> that was cool
[3:14:23] <andre11dr> Fists suck shit in DS1
[3:14:28] <Raldavar> Naruto could be worse. It could be written by Tite Kubo LUL
[3:14:29] <%CateHecate> t o o t h p i c k
[3:14:31] <Deasmeister> That's why I love the fists in Nioh 2 cool moveset
[3:14:32] <%holydeviant1> @Solidus_113 It's sure as hell got a lotta hands!
[3:14:37] <DSD24> Where's the pancake shield
[3:14:37] <problemagic> especially reggie!
[3:14:43] <andre11dr> DS2 is the only game where firsts are viable
[3:14:43] <Klefth> Bone fist best weapon in all 3 games
[3:14:51] <slix3431> Street Fighter Undead Parish Stage
[3:14:59] <Monkeyweed21> @Jimbobbity the problem is that he says its not all about Rin but then everytime we hear his thoughts its always about Rin and whenever he talks he mentions Rin so it just looks like he's still thirsting
[3:15:02] <%BananaSlammuh> S H I E L D Build
[3:15:02] <RickyRelucent> bone fist best version is dks2
[3:15:05] <Deasmeister> DS fists are kinda eh
[3:15:05] <RickyRelucent> HADOKEN
[3:15:14] <+sevorai> aye aye, Kubo is goated dont disrespect that man
[3:15:17] <+robertoszek> @Monkeyweed21 spending your teenage years in reclusion with a decrepit old man messes you up
[3:15:20] <RyuuAoi> Trauma Center reference
[3:15:21] <RickyRelucent> the shoryuken from dks1 on drazgonbone smasher
[3:15:26] <RickyRelucent> is kinda good too;
[3:15:35] <Aqualord364> It's literally a fashion choice between those two
[3:15:37] <photoniccaster> Fist weapons in DS3 are very viable too! Especially the demon fists!
[3:15:49] <andre11dr> I wish Gundyrs halbert gave you cool side kicks :Z
[3:15:56] <Aqualord364> Demon Fists in DS3 are quite solid
[3:15:58] <Monkeyweed21> like Obito could be good if he could go 1 CONVERSATION post unmasking without mentioning Rin
[3:16:00] <RickyRelucent> demon fists with demon scars
[3:16:02] <RickyRelucent> wooh!
[3:16:05] <sirrice77> @andre11dr cool boss weapons are not allowed in souls games
[3:16:18] <RickyRelucent> two pairs of demon fists for parrying, and a pair of demon scars for pyro casts
[3:16:20] <+askalta> why is chat talking about Naruto
[3:16:37] <PMda2nd> ?
[3:16:38] <+AMX004GO> dark souls jutsu
[3:16:38] <Monkeyweed21> @sirrice77 boss weapons are better than ever in DS3 and half of them still suck turbo ass
[3:16:39] <andre11dr> I don't know
[3:16:47] <Aqualord364> Did he ever actually upgrade his sword

[3:16:59] <@Solidus_113> hall bread
[3:17:02] <RyuuAoi> DEX
[3:17:02] <+plsnolookatme> Is Reggie rocking the Black Knight Shield?
[3:17:04] <%holydeviant1> +1 that clay
[3:17:06] <Aqualord364> Upgrade your sword first, honestly
[3:17:07] <+theinfamousq> Woah, hadn't kept up with the manga, Reggie lookin badass
[3:17:10] <LunarRemix> In the short term you'd do better upgrading
[3:17:10] <PMda2nd> mmmm hall bread
[3:17:16] <Aqualord364> 2000
[3:17:18] <RickyRelucent> u can make the claymore holy +1 after +5, so u cajn go catacombs at 20-30
[3:17:20] <+ThePich> upgrade your claymore
[3:17:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> It's 4:30 Woolie
[3:17:22] <%cobalt_phoenix_> the repair one feels more worth it
[3:17:23] <RickyRelucent> pls make it happen woolie
[3:17:28] <RickyRelucent> my faith i put in u
[3:17:34] <radiorosewater> It's 1:30 woolie
[3:17:40] <Aqualord364> Let him play how he wants @RickyRelucent
[3:17:40] <%holydeviant1> No really +1 is such a jump
[3:17:48] <RyuuAoi> Drop it and use Halberd
[3:17:52] <RickyRelucent> He will either way, i just want catacombs to not be a speedrun
[3:17:53] <Monkeyweed21> @RickyRelucent dude a new player is never gonna do it
[3:17:56] <RickyRelucent> its a nice funhouse
[3:17:56] <%Seancicle> üïû
[3:17:58] <+Jack8274> The Halberd has stagger if you miss
[3:18:03] <andre11dr> I'd keep the Claymore
[3:18:11] <slix3431> HALBEDIERS!
[3:18:12] <Aqualord364> Try 2 handed too
[3:18:14] <andre11dr> Claymore is goat
[3:18:14] <Shabeus> halberd pretty dang great
[3:18:15] <iacus_> considet 2-handing
[3:18:22] <+theinfamousq> Halberds are my favorite in Dark Souls
[3:18:23] <+ThePich> halberd carried me thru the entire game
[3:18:24] <%holydeviant1> It's funny that the leap attack is safer for the Halberd than the missed poke
[3:18:25] <%CateHecate> lots of sweeps
[3:18:25] <RickyRelucent> most ppl dont go catacombs unthil well into their 60s
[3:18:27] <%jepupu> 2-handing is great
[3:18:28] <zzNamttamzz> running attack please
[3:18:31] <andre11dr> A worst weapon than the one you have
[3:18:32] <RickyRelucent> straight to failure in tombs
[3:18:34] <RyuuAoi> Halberd is quicker
[3:18:34] <Aqualord364> There's no shield attack on this, just regular spears
[3:18:35] <+Jack8274> That was only added later
[3:18:37] <velgaduere> two-hand pls
[3:18:38] <RickyRelucent> cuz its like a 80 area
[3:18:39] <DSD24> Look at that cool lady
[3:18:39] <%jepupu> 2-handing is awesome
[3:18:41] <radiorosewater> Halberd and buckler was my first build, was fun
[3:18:41] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:18:43] <velgaduere> pain
[3:18:43] <Xaeveax> Running 2H claymore spin is one of the most fun attacks in the game
[3:18:45] <TigerClaws12> lmao the moonlight sword
[3:18:46] <DeathByPoke7> MLGS Kreygasm
[3:18:47] <%cobalt_phoenix_> Kappa
[3:18:49] <+Catpurnicus> 2H that halberd
[3:18:51] <noxeturna> Try it out on enemies, the Halberd will feel bad if you whiff, but if you hit it will not feel so clunky
[3:18:52] <mihokspawn> spin2Win
[3:18:55] <+Catpurnicus> and just never stop running
[3:18:56] <DXLelouch24> big weapon spoilers
[3:19:00] <TigerClaws12> spoiler ghosts LUL
[3:19:03] <DSD24> The best Moonlight Sword is the in Armored Core
[3:19:06] <+askalta> gravelord sword
[3:19:13] <velgaduere> Reggie doesn't see ghosts, for he does not believe in them
[3:19:17] <+patriotrenegade> I bet Woolie is literally holding back the floodgates of invaders with his PC rn
[3:19:18] <%CateHecate> level strength and dex to use black knight sword?
[3:19:28] <andre11dr> But for real, there's no point going back for drake sword at this point, his Claymore will be better than it with 1 more upgrade
[3:19:40] <nxflre> @patriotrenegade this zone is saafe tho. Once he gets to the church it free gaame
[3:19:43] <RickyRelucent> dont lvl dex str for black knight
[3:19:45] <user_naim> @andre11dr wait really?
[3:19:52] <RickyRelucent> it will lock u into quality build hardmode
[3:19:56] <+robertoszek> I'm quite surprised he hasn't been invaded yet, being human this whole time and all
[3:20:00] <+Catpurnicus> he has the DKS, there was never a point to the drake sword lol
[3:20:02] <RickyRelucent> double dmg stat builds are another thing
[3:20:02] <user_naim> I didn‚Äôt realize they were that close
[3:20:09] <+patriotrenegade> level Faith and Int so you can use Artorias' sword
[3:20:10] <RickyRelucent> you'll pay for it in hp
[3:20:11] <+Rafraud> big reggie
[3:20:12] <%cobalt_phoenix_> wait did reggie reverse hollowing?
[3:20:13] <RickyRelucent> or equip load
[3:20:16] <noxeturna> @robertoszek This area is safe from all invasions. It's a 'between' zone
[3:20:18] <lotharrio> Boar knight
[3:20:19] <%Rafoki> Remember he won't get invaded until he leaves the bonfire radius
[3:20:22] <+Catpurnicus> he upgraded the bonfiree
[3:20:25] <%cobalt_phoenix_> if so did he take off the helmet
[3:20:27] <+Rafraud> I forgot when can reggie learn more fire?
[3:20:36] <+robertoszek> @existingdark ahh, gotcha
[3:20:39] <%CateHecate> this is the way
[3:20:40] <Aqualord364> Depths @Rafraud
[3:20:41] <oda_flobunaga> Why not pump resistance?
[3:20:43] <%jepupu> What's reggie speccing to?
[3:20:44] <velgaduere> this is the way
[3:20:46] <user_naim> Woolie is blocking invaders with secret tech right?
[3:20:48] <JetpackMcQuack> there's an invisible army surrounding this tower
[3:20:49] <GeoGio3> We gonna go quality build, which is best build
[3:20:54] <andre11dr> I think +,3 claymore dose more than Drake Sword, could be wrong but even it's not worth at this point
[3:20:58] <+sevorai> he's going with the flow rn
[3:21:02] <RyuuAoi> @jepupu He flowing rn
[3:21:02] <radiorosewater> good stat picks
[3:21:02] <+Catpurnicus> Quality + pyro so far
[3:21:06] <Monkeyweed21> @Rafraud Laurentius is near the butcher in the depths, as long as he doesnt aggro him by mistake
[3:21:07] <%hax_metatron> Like the Claymore
[3:21:13] <user_naim> @andre11dr the more you know
[3:21:15] <%hax_metatron> Claymore is the greatest quality build weapon
[3:21:16] <agianttornado> Claymore defines Quality builds
[3:21:17] <Deasmeister> Black knight is quality yeah?
[3:21:17] <%Lion_kun> Did he upgrade the claymore?
[3:21:19] <%cobalt_phoenix_> YEYEYE
[3:21:20] <AvroEltz> we all know that reggie is going for a bow build
[3:21:20] <RickyRelucent> dont EVER send laurentius to the swamp

[3:29:44] <+Rafraud> Nice corner
[3:29:46] <RyuuAoi> True.
[3:29:49] <RickyRelucent> and i usually carry humanity/heal spells
[3:29:51] <RickyRelucent> to offset
[3:29:51] <kikosmore> only a couple for now :)
[3:29:52] <peyodogo> woolie should prob try to not teach reggie the lessons the game should be teaching instead, or they're not going to take
[3:29:56] <%IronOhki> Reggie is really good at that dash R2
[3:30:00] <+Rafraud> Pls parry him mr knight
[3:30:03] <AvroEltz> Ok, u just want to know when will the balder parry reggie
[3:30:04] <radiorosewater> BOOT
[3:30:05] <RickyRelucent> normal heal, or excerpt
[3:30:08] <RickyRelucent> are my choices
[3:30:09] <kikosmore> that walk
[3:30:09] <%CappuccinoGuil> So, I wonder what happened with the way DS1 shows summon previews, because Twitch Chat was supposed to be PURPLE.
[3:30:10] <+Rafraud> DAMMIT
[3:30:12] <user_naim> @rickyrelucent Toxic Mist is still one of my favorite ‚Äùfuck this‚Äù buttons
[3:30:15] <%IronOhki> Gotta incorporate that nooch R2
[3:30:16] <RickyRelucent> both of em mix well
[3:30:17] <PlagueOfGripes> how has one of these dudes not parry stanced him yet
[3:30:17] <+Catpurnicus> driiiink
[3:30:18] <RickyRelucent> HA
[3:30:18] <%jepupu> 2-handing goes through shields much better
[3:30:20] <+patriotrenegade> o careful
[3:30:21] <RyuuAoi> Can Reggie get more fireballs?
[3:30:24] <causewaybob> Success is success bullshit your way to victory Regarth
[3:30:24] <PlagueOfGripes> the one up the stairs 100% will
[3:30:25] <RickyRelucent> i''m a fan of acid breath myself
[3:30:27] <user_naim> @cappuccinoguil oh that‚Äôs good
[3:30:30] <RickyRelucent> especially on afk players
[3:30:35] <%Rafoki> Baller knights don't fail us, PARRY HIM
[3:30:36] <Aqualord364> They've gone into parry stance a ton of times, he just fireballs them when they do @PlagueOfGripes
[3:30:43] <+Rafraud> The fire keeper soul
[3:30:43] <Raldavar> So any bets on Reggie getting a BSS?
[3:30:49] <RickyRelucent> gotta love how the breath spells make it so u dont see shit
[3:30:50] <nxflre> lmao he gonna luagh when he finds out
[3:30:53] <Darren716> @RyuuAoi Technically yes, he can buy another spell to put in another slot
[3:30:53] <%CappuccinoGuil> @RyuuAoi bonfires replenish the max, you can increase max by buying more of the same spell
[3:30:56] <+Jack8274> The R2 combos

[3:40:43] <RickyRelucent> yeah but just because he played DeS doesn't mean it translates literallyy
[3:40:45] <+kraajkase> this is why i hate the remaster. Aggro ranges for all enemies got extended.

[3:53:13] <+Rafraud> HEAL

[3:53:49] <user_naim> did he do any damage?
[3:53:50] <JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[3:53:51] <Ramasama13> @RickyRelucent jesus christ
[3:53:51] <RyuuAoi> R2 for tight corridors
[3:53:55] <QueequegTheater> RETURN TO WOMB
[3:54:01] <andre11dr> So what's the actual lore reason for BK showing up in the Asylum after the choosen undead leaves?
[3:54:01] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1455421207659139081?t=Np244HCpRXfSBOkB2__Gpw&s=19
[3:54:03] <zenith0111> Duel 2. Lets Rock!
[3:54:03] <nxflre> @user_naim one fireballl and one swing i think
[3:54:04] <Darren716> I forget, do one of the asylum knights drop the BKUGS?
[3:54:11] <pyjama_day> ye ^
[3:54:14] <RickyRelucent> think one is a ugs knight
[3:54:24] <+ElMaestroChoque> ElMaestroChoque subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[3:54:25] <pyjama_day> i think
[3:54:26] <nxflre> coming back for round 2
[3:54:30] <DianaTheAscian> That enemy falls apart with patients and strafing I find
[3:54:44] <%CateHecate> @andre11dr i always headcanon'd it to be whoever it is left saying "oh fuck an undead actually got out" and sending them to investigate but thats probably super wrong
[3:54:44] <+paladinstarbuster> Gotta remember the stab
[3:54:48] <AvroEltz> problem is strafing in tight rooms
[3:55:00] <+eimiyoshikawa> They're both great swords
[3:55:08] <TigerClaws12> LUL
[3:55:14] <+stantashev> Dark knights have resist to fire right?
[3:55:19] <Chatterbox1991> is the zone bugged? where is the knight from before?
[3:55:20] <+Rafraud> early
[3:55:21] <RyuuAoi> Greedy
[3:55:23] <velgaduere> partial parry
[3:55:23] <@Solidus_113> tried to be slick
[3:55:24] <+Rafraud> good try tho
[3:55:25] <%IronOhki> YES!
[3:55:26] <Deasmeister> almost
[3:55:26] <brunoberserk> BALLSY
[3:55:27] <TigerClaws12> partial
[3:55:27] <%IronOhki> LEARN NOW!
[3:55:29] <Treasure_Vault> YEAH
[3:55:31] <velgaduere> PARRY PRACTICE BEGINS
[3:55:31] <+patriotrenegade> Black Knights have HIGH resistance to fire
[3:55:31] <+liquidzr0> shofuMillyrock
[3:55:31] <%IronOhki> Let's go!
[3:55:33] <+Rafraud> NAH REGGIE IS RIGHT
[3:55:33] <vivaciouseff> @stantashev ye
[3:55:34] <+buttdirt> good parry practice
[3:55:34] <%IronOhki> Nothing to lose!
[3:55:35] <+vaderxyz1970> Parry Labbing
[3:55:35] <Treasure_Vault> It's never bad to learn to parry

[3:55:39] <AvroEltz> Yeah, good place to pratice
[3:55:39] <+sevorai> yee yee yee
[3:55:40] <%jepupu> Timing yeah
[3:55:41] <OblivionSword1> might as well learn now
[3:55:41] <kikosmore> the reward is high
[3:55:42] <%IronOhki> GO REGGIE GO!
[3:55:43] <%hax_metatron> Reggie that is EXACTLY what I did on my first playthrough.  Parry practice on this SAME Black Knight!~!!!
[3:55:45] <andre11dr> @catehecate But they're not the actual knights anymore, they're basically empty charred armours, you can't really give them orders
[3:55:47] <QueequegTheater> THIS IS NOW A PARRY STREAM
[3:55:47] <zenith0111> All shields have different parry windows
[3:55:47] <%IronOhki> Become Giant!
[3:55:47] <+Rafraud> LEARN THE MATCHUP
[3:55:48] <%BallerSwagBro9k> PARRY GOD INCOMING
[3:55:50] <RickyRelucent> Its easier to parryy then a UGS knight
[3:55:52] <AncyentMarinere> PowerUpL TooSpicy PowerUpR
[3:55:53] <PlagueOfGripes> that shield and parrying HMMMMM
[3:55:54] <Treasure_Vault> If you can parry, you can be the cool guy
[3:55:54] <Deasmeister> doesn't matter no souls at stake
[3:55:55] <RickyRelucent> cuz its faster
[3:55:58] <+patriotrenegade> 1 victor
[3:55:58] <%jonblnt> You gonna learn today
[3:56:00] <%CateHecate> heater is slightly better for parries because faster
[3:56:01] <radiorosewater> "o...k..." -Woolie, 2021
[3:56:02] <RickyRelucent> dunno, differs from person to person
[3:56:08] <+Rafraud> just frame
[3:56:08] <RickyRelucent> i have more trouble parryying the ugs knight
[3:56:10] <RickyRelucent> sue me
[3:56:10] <noxeturna> REGGIE taking the wheel with style
[3:56:11] <DeathByPoke7> LETS GO JUSTIN
[3:56:13] <%Ensign_Epic> reggie going to the LAB
[3:56:14] <Laironx3> focus on the enemy's hand, not the weapon
[3:56:24] <+Rafraud> Late
[3:56:24] <Darren716> Does Reggie know he can block and parry?
[3:56:27] <RickyRelucent> partial
[3:56:28] <nabs96> hey @plagueofgripes any chance we get a Reggiehunter soon?
[3:56:29] <RickyRelucent> neato
[3:56:30] <%IronOhki> Window is small, but you can find it.
[3:56:31] <TigerClaws12> partial again LUL
[3:56:33] <zenith0111> Late parry is a half block
[3:56:35] <RyuuAoi> That was cheap. He had that.
[3:56:35] <%CoffeeKaiju> "ahww...."
[3:56:40] <Treasure_Vault> Don't parry on stairs
[3:56:40] <+Rafraud> He's late ye
[3:56:42] <velgaduere> that shield ain't so great for parrying
[3:56:43] <+Amaideus> Did Reggie have difficulty with the Red Eye knights in DeS too?
[3:56:43] <+eimiyoshikawa> The key to parrying is
[3:56:43] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Kreygasm
[3:56:43] <andre11dr> Empty hand is genuinely better at parrying than that shield
[3:56:44] <kikosmore> let him know he doesn't have to spam r1 afterwards lol
[3:56:44] <@Solidus_113> smaller shield could help
[3:56:45] <Neo_Kyon> oatsP
[3:56:46] <ArOne_Start> watch his hands
[3:56:48] <RickyRelucent> he could setup parryy keeping his shield up
[3:56:49] <PlagueOfGripes> that's also a terrible shield to learn to parry with
[3:56:49] <noxeturna> The best parry advice I've ever gotten: Watch his HAND. Not his Sword.
[3:56:51] <youngking_kush> DONT TRY TO PARRY ON STAIRS
[3:56:52] <%holydeviant1> Might want to try a smaller shield
[3:56:53] <JetpackMcQuack> bad guess
[3:56:53] <+eimiyoshikawa> When the enemy's weapon hand starts moving toward you
[3:56:53] <GeoGio3> if you poise through it is a half parry
[3:56:55] <RickyRelucent> letting the knight hit the shield
[3:56:55] <QueequegTheater> He doesn't have any parry shields
[3:56:56] <brunoberserk> smaller shield helps reggie
[3:56:56] <zenith0111> That shields harder to parry with
[3:56:58] <%hax_metatron> Smaller shield can help practice better
[3:56:58] <Jerp> parry on stairs, riposte enemy through stairs into space
[3:57:00] <RickyRelucent> wait for the followup
[3:57:01] <%IronOhki> @andre11dr True, but it's not bad to learn that window with the shield.
[3:57:01] <Treasure_Vault> Stairs make parries awful. You can also put on a smaller shield for more parry frames.
[3:57:01] <velgaduere> parrying with smaller shields is better
[3:57:05] <RickyRelucent> mhm
[3:57:13] <+paladinstarbuster> no keep going
[3:57:13] <Johannen> You parry the hand not the sword
[3:57:14] <+RemedyofRevenge> Watch and parry his hand, not the weapon is good advice in this game @WoolieVersus
[3:57:19] <PlagueOfGripes> you're parrying his attack hand, not the weapon
[3:57:23] <Darren716> I mean if he's gonna use this shield he may as well practice on it
[3:57:25] <restingbones> Training montage in real time
[3:57:27] <DeathByPoke7> i like watch the hand trick
[3:57:28] <pyjama_day> I'm a crazy person who prefers the mid-sized shield parries tot he small-sized parries >_>
[3:57:30] <ShadowZiggy> Hello all aeroDance aeroDance aeroDance
[3:57:34] <pyjama_day> *to the
[3:57:38] <OblivionSword1> there's also the option to parry with your bare hand if you're baller enough
[3:57:38] <radiorosewater> riposte with caestus next to fog door to clip into boss rooms
[3:57:40] <Vaardvark> ye, watch the hands
[3:57:44] <+Rafraud> late boi
[3:57:45] <RyuuAoi> Hmmmmm
[3:57:45] <AncyentMarinere> When you get the timing you unlocked easy mode
[3:57:45] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> Follow his handf
[3:57:47] <RickyRelucent> @pyjama_day i like emptyy hand parries
[3:57:49] <%Ensign_Epic> mid shield you can do more reliable setup parries usually
[3:57:49] <ppangboi> @pyjama_day I learned that way at first too, even if I'm better with a small shield these days
[3:57:51] <JetpackMcQuack> WutFace bit late
[3:57:54] <QueequegTheater> LUL
[3:57:55] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> for the parry
[3:57:57] <RickyRelucent> dragonbone smasher, or cestus w/e
[3:58:04] <Jerp> guess they haven't gotten a good bead on how close you need to be standing to parry?

[3:58:53] <RickyRelucent> man these are tough
[3:58:59] <+Rafraud> waaaaaay early
[3:59:00] <RickyRelucent> so early to be back here
[3:59:01] <%cobalt_phoenix_> he learnin
[3:59:01] <kikosmore> he's mashing r1 after parrying.
[3:59:02] <nabs96> has reggie killed the stray demon?
[3:59:02] <%IronOhki> It's happening!
[3:59:04] <QueequegTheater> A bit early Kappa
[3:59:07] <GeoGio3> parry the hand not the weapon
[3:59:09] <velgaduere> one day, Reggie will learn parry > triangle > R1
[3:59:09] <+GilroyGoldBlood> lprodYOU lprodDIED
[3:59:10] <%holydeviant1> Knights are rough parries, but it's good to learn
[3:59:10] <+Rafraud> Reggie training arc
[3:59:11] <QueequegTheater> @nabs96 lmao
[3:59:11] <DeathByPoke7> stabs are hard in general
[3:59:14] <QueequegTheater> no
[3:59:15] <pyjama_day> @kikosmore because he believes
[3:59:17] <%IronOhki> @nabs96 No, and you wouldn't believe.
[3:59:19] <SolidusA> hit em with a pointy end
[3:59:19] <RyuuAoi> Get you some elbow room! Get you some elbow room! So you can boom-shaka-laka-boom
[3:59:24] <zenith0111> Btw theres zero reason to fight this guy they just want to lol
[3:59:25] <thefreakmuseum> fireball spam
[3:59:25] <glass_marcus> Reggie vs the stray demon would take 2 hours
[3:59:26] <+Rafraud> But, this is a good place to learn the timing
[3:59:26] <NumbF4ke> @nabs96 no he somehow danced around the hole and didn'
[3:59:26] <thefreakmuseum> do it!!
[3:59:28] <NumbF4ke> t dfrop
[3:59:29] <+eimiyoshikawa> Watch the hands, not the weapon. When they move toward you is the time to strike.
[3:59:31] <%cobalt_phoenix_> last one Kappa
[3:59:31] <zzNamttamzz> stabs are easier to parry
[3:59:31] <youngking_kush> He didnt get the Riposte
[3:59:34] <nabs96> @queequegtheater lol what did I miss
[3:59:34] <andre11dr> Great, now find this man the hornet ring and the game is over Kappa
[3:59:38] <BurdRightsActivist> what about the key, though
[3:59:39] <%Deekman> at the very least get that ring because he won't be here for HOURS
[3:59:46] <youngking_kush> That's why damage was low
[3:59:46] <RickyRelucent> @SolidusA go for the murderstroke and twohand the blade
[3:59:47] <nabs96> @numbf4ke oh that's fucking amazing
[3:59:49] <kikosmore> @pyjama_day believing isn't gonna put him in range to actually follow up lol.
[3:59:50] <Estuko> LUL That ghost that ran towards reggie and punched scared me lol
[3:59:52] <linSP> What if Reggie gets a black knight drop
[3:59:57] <+Rafraud> Late
[4:00:00] <velgaduere> too late
[4:00:01] <%IronOhki> @linSP He already got the sword.
[4:00:02] <JetpackMcQuack> come back anytime
[4:00:02] <TigerClaws12> too far?
[4:00:02] <ppangboi> @youngking_kush he did get the first one
[4:00:07] <%ken_kuma> @linSP He got the sword
[4:00:07] <%hax_metatron> Get the ring
[4:00:07] <DeathByPoke7> not bad lots of partials
[4:00:09] <pyjama_day> @kikosmore hehehe, i didnt say he was RIGHT to believe ^_^
[4:00:11] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @linSP he already did
[4:00:11] <RickyRelucent> end them rightly!
[4:00:12] <GeoGio3> parry the hand not the weapon
[4:00:12] <agianttornado> Rusty Iron Ring here?
[4:00:13] <Johannen> Watch the hand, not the sword
[4:00:16] <QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus That shield has a terrible parry window
[4:00:16] <%IronOhki> I am here for parry labbing.
[4:00:18] <Darren716> Honestly it'd be radder if he got the other knight's drop
[4:00:18] <TigerClaws12> that was a LOT of partial parries
[4:00:19] <+paladinstarbuster> gotta watch his hands
[4:00:20] <%holydeviant1> There IS a fail state
[4:00:21] <+Rafraud> There's partial parry
[4:00:22] <royb2> yes there is woolie
[4:00:23] <linSP> damn lucky reg
[4:00:24] <mikesapartment> there IS failed parry
[4:00:25] <DSD24> Counter Hit
[4:00:26] <royb2> there is partial parry woolie
[4:00:28] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus There are totaly partial parries
[4:00:28] <+Rafraud> Wrong info
[4:00:32] <%holydeviant1> Partial parries give half damage
[4:00:34] <Deasmeister> the partial parry happened
[4:00:40] <user_naim> uhh
[4:00:42] <mikesapartment> it's when he takes less damage yes
[4:00:43] <%jepupu> Counter hit
[4:00:43] <QueequegTheater> In the tradition of Souls LPs, Woolie is super wrong
[4:00:44] <RickyRelucent> the tink
[4:00:44] <%cobalt_phoenix_> yes reggie
[4:00:45] <GeoGio3> yes
[4:00:46] <RickyRelucent> ye
[4:00:47] <+Chimeraelite> Yes.
[4:00:47] <+Rafraud> Partial you take less damage
[4:00:47] <Hydrapissed> ye
[4:00:47] <youngking_kush> Partial Parry halves damage yeah
[4:00:49] <Treasure_Vault> Heater Shield might be better to learn parrying, it's got fewer recovery frames?
[4:00:50] <agianttornado> @WoolieVersus its a bad block
[4:01:01] <AvroEltz> when you take damage but the parry animation continues
[4:01:02] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:01:04] <+ReallyBigRocks> Student becomes the master
[4:01:04] <user_naim> lol
[4:01:04] <JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[4:01:05] <nxflre> oof looks likee they'll miss the itmes
[4:01:05] <%holydeviant1> In fact, you can partial parry LITERALLY EVERYTHING IN THE GAME, but full parries are only for humanoids with weapons.
[4:01:10] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Correct, partial parry will negate the stunlock and some of the damage, and it may or may not actually knock the enemy into a ripostable state
[4:01:12] <brunoberserk> @WoolieVersus  let him try with a smaller shield
[4:01:13] <zenith0111> Reggie should kindle
[4:01:15] <%jepupu> Daggers deal insane damage on parry
[4:01:18] <+Amaideus> Your parry frames are the entirety of the time your hand is moving OUT from your body
[4:01:22] <noxeturna> Welcome @A_German_spy
[4:01:30] <+Bouerd> Reggie's standing way too far away
[4:01:30] <TigerClaws12> partial again LUL
[4:01:32] <rysku> too far away
[4:01:35] <TigerClaws12> too far
[4:01:36] <RyuuAoi> Naw Reggie getting it.
[4:01:43] <youngking_kush> That guy Spy is here,dope
[4:01:45] <andre11dr> And here i was ,thinking we would see the Capra demon today.......
[4:01:45] <RickyRelucent> we have some big names in the cumminty here @german @PlagueOfGripes
[4:01:49] <RickyRelucent> feels good
[4:01:50] <%holydeviant1> Like, you can partial-parry the Taurus, but you can't parry it.
[4:01:51] <+SenorCounter> Glancing blow
[4:01:51] <+robertoszek> get in his face, easier to parry
[4:01:52] <+AHomeschoolDropout> Parry as soon as his arm starts moving, that's what helped me
[4:01:54] <DianaTheAscian> A kindle wouldn't really help here I think
[4:01:58] <GeoGio3> if you poise through it is a half parry
[4:01:59] <RickyRelucent> reg will get all the help he needs
[4:02:00] <%Deekman> @WoolieVersus Parries are WAY harder on the stairs
[4:02:01] <pyjama_day> @holydeviant1 i dunno...those boulders later in the game still knocked me down :P
[4:02:01] <%hax_metatron> TRY A SMALLER SHIELD FOR ONE RUN REGGIE
[4:02:02] <+Rafraud> It just means your timing was off
[4:02:03] <TigerClaws12> too far away
[4:02:10] <+Chimeraelite> I think it's on either end. Early or late
[4:02:10] <%Juriasu> the parry was too late I think
[4:02:10] <user_naim> fact checking will ruin/save this lp
[4:02:13] <Jerp> You may need to stand a bit closer - it's easier if you're hardly half a step from literally touching them
[4:02:26] <RyuuAoi> Need to wait one millisecond more I guess, Reggie
[4:02:28] <%holydeviant1> @pyjama_day That's the /next/ instance  of damage hitting you
[4:02:29] <+Rafraud> Get in his face
[4:02:29] <+Amaideus> If it was too late he'd just get hit, parry frames start up instantly
[4:02:38] <%jepupu> Last try #5
[4:02:41] <pyjama_day> @holydeviant1 dont i know it >_>
[4:02:42] <oneimportantthing> If the first parry fails, roll away and regain composure
[4:02:44] <+sevorai> let him parry with that shield, he's gonna be using it anyway
[4:02:44] <vivaciouseff> @hax_metatron iirc outside of bucklers or parrying daggers, the parry window on all shields (and bare hand) is the same in DS1
[4:02:46] <AvroEltz> can he parry the stinger?
[4:02:55] <AncyentMarinere> Yeah you can parry the stinger
[4:02:57] <TigerClaws12> stinger is parry-able, yes
[4:03:01] <+Chimeraelite> Note there's startup on parry
[4:03:02] <DeathByPoke7> just the tip
[4:03:03] <+Rafraud> M E A T Y
[4:03:06] <zenith0111> Give this man a parry dagger
[4:03:08] <QueequegTheater> HITBOXES psaWhat
[4:03:08] <Treasure_Vault> Don't try and parry on stairs, it's ultra wonky
[4:03:08] <pyjama_day> @holydeviant1 i think it hit me 3 times in 1 go <_<''
[4:03:10] <AncyentMarinere> You can parry all the black knights moves except the shield bash
[4:03:15] <youngking_kush> Yeah you can parry Stinger it's just tougher
[4:03:16] <RyuuAoi> I swear you've got it, Reggie
[4:03:18] <kikosmore> This reminds me when Woolie was fighting that gun enemy in sekiro
[4:03:22] <royb2> there's startup frames, additionally train parrying with a parry shield first
[4:03:26] <%IronOhki> Reggie will so totally get it.
[4:03:29] <Hydrapissed> Fight games? 1 frame links reggie come on
[4:03:32] <QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus THE SHIELD IS MAKING IT HARDER
[4:03:32] <%IronOhki> Reggie is gonna be a parry beast.
[4:03:35] <%hax_metatron> @vivaciouseff It's more the shape of the Balder Shield, it's unfortunately narrower so the window looks weird to me at least
[4:03:35] <b_ikki> yeah one frame links are harder lol
[4:03:37] <Deko_> or is it
[4:03:37] <DSD24> Every game has different timing
[4:03:38] <+swesterly> The window is tighter with larger shields
[4:03:38] <+Rafraud> Reggie had it earlier
[4:03:38] <AvroEltz> yeah but this game is bullshit so its not the same
[4:03:39] <andre11dr> It's at least better than the DS2 parry
[4:03:43] <TigerClaws12> dude, it's 6 frames
[4:03:44] <%CateHecate> Third Strike Parry
[4:03:45] <Treasure_Vault> The wikidot page on parries has frame data.
[4:03:45] <nxflre> lets see if he explores the rest of the aarea
[4:03:48] <QueequegTheater> One frame links are literally 6 times harder
[4:04:02] <TigerClaws12> it's 6 frames, 3rd strike blue parry LUL
[4:04:05] <%hax_metatron> It's rock paper scissors
[4:04:06] <nabs96> hey wait a minute I thought woolie said they wouldn't read chat anymore
[4:04:06] <RyuuAoi> Reggie cant parry in 3D LUL
[4:04:08] <QueequegTheater> LUL
[4:04:12] <Johannen> second try guys
[4:04:15] <Johannen> here we come
[4:04:15] <Treasure_Vault> Buckler has 8 frames, merchant sells it.
[4:04:17] <+Rafraud> Hes gonna dodge it again

[4:40:50] <b_ikki> (that sucks)
[4:40:53] <+Jack8274> Also Cast Speed is linked to your Dex, Max speed at 45 Dex
[4:40:55] <DianaTheAscian> also makes him lose some moves
[4:40:56] <+terry_quest> or a helmet i think
[4:41:00] <kikosmore> The weapon level is more important right now imo. They just melt.
[4:41:01] <+paladinstarbuster> His fireball is way safer
[4:41:02] <Monkeyweed21> The weapon also sucks ass
[4:41:02] <Darren716> Jack8274 What
[4:41:04] <RickyRelucent> i'm no meta slave, go full clayymore quality for all i care
[4:41:08] <RickyRelucent> : 3
[4:41:08] <Johannen> 2 possible summons for that fight
[4:41:09] <Deko_> JOLLY COOPERATION
[4:41:11] <Raldavar> It takes 3 swings to match the damage of 1 fireball though
[4:41:15] <slippery_arms> even the odds
[4:41:16] <Darren716> Does that count for sorceries too?
[4:41:17] <+pectusumbra> what's that helmet?
[4:41:19] <%Juriasu> yes.... turn human
[4:41:22] <dmtjinni> co op FTW
[4:41:22] <+Jack8274> @Darren716 Spell cast speed is linked to Dex in Dark Souls 1
[4:41:23] <GeoGio3> lore sunlight bros
[4:41:26] <DianaTheAscian> @terry_quest helmets a random drop from just killing them

[4:41:46] <RickyRelucent> this is the one run
[4:41:52] <%Dakuu75> can you lock on to the taile, specifically?
[4:41:57] <vivaciouseff> no kindle firelink
[4:41:59] <Monkeyweed21> The Tail Axe sucks ass btw dont worry too much about it
[4:42:05] <+Rasheedt> @dakuu75 nah
[4:42:07] <+Jack8274> @TheBesteban Killing the boss doesn't stop you from putting down a sign
[4:42:08] <RickyRelucent> tail axe is meme tier
[4:42:09] <+terry_quest> @Dakuu75 no gotta free aim it
[4:42:11] <buerdo> He has to talk to lautrec at firelink as well
[4:42:13] <Johannen> @TheBesteban Why would killing a boss stop you from droping a sign?
[4:42:13] <%IronOhki> @Monkeyweed21 More like tail ass, am I rite?
[4:42:14] <RickyRelucent> u can make it work

[4:42:20] <GeoGio3> LAUTREC
[4:42:20] <LunarRemix> He's weak to lighting so you could use a Pine Resin for extra damage
[4:42:20] <Jaysky> Doesn't the axe need a shitton of STR?
[4:42:23] <Darren716> Or not til after the boss?
[4:42:28] <Landedx> @Monkeyweed21 yeah but I can have it so I need to have it

[5:01:30] <%dreadedcthulhu> i am enlightened
[5:01:31] <%dreadedcthulhu> Kappa
[5:01:31] <RickyRelucent> ehhhh its the one u want if u rock faith int build
[5:01:38] <RickyRelucent> and int is ur best stat
[5:01:38] <Deko_> faith is dumb
[5:01:38] <Jaysky> Big think
[5:01:40] <Slim_Lipid> Cross stat attacks Kreygasm
[5:01:41] <KyberNasse> Gravelording is doing a prank and doxxing your own address
[5:01:48] <+eanscrale> Unfortunately you still have to meet the faith requirements for casting
[5:01:49] <%cobalt_phoenix_> still need faith to use it, but dmg based on int
[5:01:49] <GeoGio3> nah
[5:01:49] <oda_flobunaga> NO
[5:01:50] <Slim_Lipid> Basically pokemon :)
[5:01:52] <+Amaideus> It's a terrible build efficiency wise, but it's fun lore
[5:01:55] <velgaduere> BRUTE FAITH
[5:01:56] <nxflre> but need faith to use miracles so it useless lol
[5:01:56] <Johannen> Still need faith i think
[5:01:57] <DianaTheAscian> you fire boy not magic boy
[5:02:03] <youngking_kush> It's just cool
[5:02:08] <QueequegTheater> You're stupid and skeptical, a dangerous combination
[5:02:11] <Shwepie> You can either have faith in the stories or you can memorize them.
[5:02:11] <zenith0111> But as Pyromancer couldnt he spec into int and faith if he really wanted to?
[5:02:22] <Lefteron> The problem is you still need the faith to cast the miracle, but the effect will scale with inteligence
[5:02:22] <restingbones> I dont believe in god, but because of this thing, god believes in me
[5:02:25] <RyuuAoi> You can always grind off screen, Reggie. People will try to crucify you like they did to Pat, but you can!
[5:02:26] <DianaTheAscian> Thats souls games
[5:02:28] <+Grayhammatter> Every time? every time
[5:02:30] <lotharrio> I always do quality builds so I can try out different things.
[5:02:33] <+Nexzu> str builds are usually peoples first
[5:02:34] <Monkeyweed21> @zenith0111 he could, but pyro is free so most builds could yea
[5:02:35] <Deko_> i started over like 5 times before finishing for the first time
[5:02:36] <youngking_kush> Reggie this why we are still playing Dark Souls
[5:02:37] <QueequegTheater> @zenith0111 You can always spec into both.  But pyro doesn't scale with any stats
[5:02:38] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Yeah or you go quality
[5:02:40] <GeoGio3> or just go gigafed and try everything
[5:02:42] <%debrv> Welcome to the Souls Games.
[5:02:46] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus That's completely normal. The only alternative is leveling up every stat on your first playthrough so that you can do EVERYTHING. And that takes tons of time and effort.
[5:02:49] <TigerClaws12> or you fire up cheat engine
[5:02:54] <DrkJP520> My first Dark Souls character was a jack-of-all-trades, and he sucked
[5:02:57] <RickyRelucent> You'd wanna start as a Hunter or a Sorcerer, just to get the lowest  stats u can elsewhere, int/faith or Res for example
[5:03:00] <dmtjinni> YEYEYEYE
[5:03:03] <@Menitta> YEAH BELL
[5:03:03] <velgaduere> 3 BONG
[5:03:04] <Shwepie> @zenith0111 Dark Souls 1 doesn't scale pyro like that. Just based on the level of your flame.
[5:03:07] <RickyRelucent> But pyros dont have especially low int
[5:03:08] <a_mad_dragon_> or you use item duplication on a boss soul
[5:03:08] <andre11dr> If Reggie wants spells he's better off going with Int ,because Hexes are dope as shit
[5:03:08] <RickyRelucent> so u could
[5:03:09] <sendart> or spams a falchion
[5:03:10] <Zantetzuken> KomodoHype
[5:03:12] <+Grayhammatter> bing bong
[5:03:16] <Monkeyweed21> BEEFSTRONG BELIEVES IN THE LORD is my current playthrough
[5:03:23] <GeoGio3> @A_German_spy my 2011 blind one was like that
[5:03:24] <@Menitta> aw man I'm so glad I know that now
[5:03:25] <RickyRelucent> i forget what kind of int they start with
[5:03:27] <RickyRelucent> 9?
[5:03:33] <@Menitta> I need to play DS1
[5:03:35] <%holydeviant1> Int/Pyro is fun but dangerous
[5:03:37] <JdotSweapA> DING DONG
[5:03:37] <royb2> yellow strength>blue dex
[5:04:00] <%A_German_spy> @GeoGio3 My first playthroughs usually go that direction too, yeah. First time for me is about learning what the options are. Subsequent runs are for picking a path and sticking with it.
[5:04:02] <RickyRelucent> dex int pyro build pog
[5:04:03] <Jaysky> Is a cool detail to the game for sure (the bell that is)
[5:04:04] <zenith0111> Pure pYromancer is pretty dank tho
[5:04:08] <Lefteron> I havent replayed DS1 in a few years. Perhaps a replay is in order.
[5:04:10] <DianaTheAscian> I always wanted to do a bow play through
[5:04:10] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[5:04:14] <+cdrom321> @menitta If you haven't, yes. Yes, you do.
[5:04:19] <andre11dr> Pyro gets a bunch of good shit too ,infact it gets a bunch of cool shit
[5:04:26] <youngking_kush> I'm Quality build first run all day
[5:04:30] <JdotSweapA> WRATH OF THE GODS
[5:04:31] <DSD24> A bow playthrough was cool in DS2 since you could move and shoot
[5:04:31] <+AHomeschoolDropout> Yea same, I think my first playthrough I picked warrior and levelled STR+DEX equally until I finally stuck with STR
[5:04:35] <Jaysky> In DS1 my first playthrough was starting off as a pyro and turned into a tank build
[5:04:42] <RickyRelucent> this ring, and the blood shield
[5:04:43] <Lefteron> POISON
[5:04:47] <RickyRelucent> goes well with priscilla's scyythe
[5:04:48] <andre11dr> Reggie just needs to make sure to find the NPCs to get the pyro spells
[5:04:50] <Jaysky> Sac
[5:04:52] <Lefteron> poison poison poison
[5:04:56] <RickyRelucent> which inflicts blood on urself
[5:04:57] <+Grayhammatter> ring of sac
[5:05:15] <Jaysky> One shot, one opportunity
[5:05:20] <oda_flobunaga> NO
[5:05:24] <sendart> boooneees
[5:05:25] <Monkeyweed21> @Menitta its age is definitely showing but the first 3rd of the game is still so immaculately designed that I could write a thesis on it
[5:05:26] <RickyRelucent> you find plenty
[5:05:27] <Johannen> You can use those rings after you die to prevent your Death Souls to not dissapear
[5:05:30] <RickyRelucent> and you'll use em never
[5:05:34] <+Grayhammatter> yoooo, we got the boar helm?
[5:05:35] <+aBoner89> ring of sac ResidentSleeper
[5:05:39] <photoniccaster> Unless you wanna use certain boss weapons, faith isn‚Äôt really worth investing into IMO. At least for a first play through.
[5:05:40] <warpiscute> i hope there's no point in the game where a ring of sacrifice is useful
[5:05:46] <RickyRelucent> the other sac ring is much better
[5:05:47] <fruit_pie_the_magician> If you're about to get pwned, it's always good to get that on if you have a lot of souls
[5:05:58] <DSD24> Feeble cursed one!
[5:06:00] <%hax_metatron> Talk to him again though
[5:06:08] <slippery_arms> look at his stance tho
[5:06:08] <oda_flobunaga> Ring of sacrifice is useful for Bed of Chaos, nothing else
[5:06:11] <Jaysky> @warpiscute There is a few where it could be worth it but you won't know where until it's too late
[5:06:29] <Monkeyweed21> @photoniccaster yea faith weapons and miracles are really strong but you just get starved for the entire first half for anything
[5:06:30] <DianaTheAscian> is the covenant haircut rn?
[5:06:41] <Jaysky> Good guy laugh
[5:06:42] <+derpumpkinking> I love two sessions today, but dont push too hard Reggie.
[5:06:42] <huskarl_zap> a kek indeed
[5:06:43] <Softekan> Classic Carim
[5:06:45] <DSD24> Laughing is fun
[5:06:47] <Solidnick18> he has a nice laugh
[5:06:48] <sirrice77> hey man that's just the Carim laugh
[5:06:52] <%DashXero> How did he know?
[5:06:53] <%Deekman> this dude always reminds me of the hangman from men in tights
[5:06:53] <velgaduere> laughter is the only way to prevent hollowing Reggie, don't hate
[5:06:55] <+liquidzr0> danCult
[5:06:58] <+Jack8274> You don't need faith\
[5:06:59] <Lefteron> he..he..he..he
[5:06:59] <andre11dr> If you want use spells just go Int ,it's objectively better than Faith, unless you want to Falcion spam
[5:06:59] <@Menitta> "this sucks man. hahahaha"
[5:07:05] <+Grayhammatter> reggie got the black knight shield too, aw heck yeah
[5:07:06] <derap41> well what is this stream?
[5:07:07] <QueequegTheater> A Church representative in a Japanese game is evil? Say it ain't so ResidentSleeper
[5:07:08] <+aBoner89> 4Head hehehe
[5:07:09] <DotDusk> He he heh heh
[5:07:11] <%hax_metatron> Homebone
[5:07:11] <DSD24> What about the Well What is It pose? its the best one!
[5:07:19] <slippery_arms> bone back to bonfire
[5:07:19] <DianaTheAscian> Also check out that gesture its a cool one
[5:07:20] <+cdrom321> It's 25 faith now instead of 50?
[5:07:21] <+Grayhammatter> homebone
[5:07:23] <+Jack8274> You can literally just coop 3 times and that works too
[5:07:25] <sendart> grinding co op is probably not best for lp
[5:07:25] <youngking_kush> Bone out
[5:07:27] <Jaysky> I lost my wife, my children, got water in me boots... KEKEKEKEKEKE.
[5:07:31] <RickyRelucent> some heal spells
[5:07:33] <Lefteron> For each player you have helped killed a boss the faith requared is lowered by five I believe
[5:07:34] <%Rafoki> He can go basement key or woods by Andre
[5:07:36] <zenith0111> Theres also the undead burg and stuff
[5:07:38] <%A_German_spy> @cdrom321 Yeah, they changed it in one of the original patches in PTDE
[5:07:38] <RickyRelucent> i guess path of transcendence?

[5:07:56] <Frostilk> hope to hear some of the soulsborne VAs again in elden ring
[5:07:59] <+paladinstarbuster> did he?
[5:08:05] <%hax_metatron> Follow the bodies LUL
[5:08:10] <+Jack8274> The faith requirement goes down by 5 every time you co-op, so it literally only needs 3-4 times which takes 20 minutes
[5:08:10] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Kappa
[5:08:14] <%A_German_spy> @andre11dr Power Within? It's fantastic
[5:08:15] <+HeroSolaire> @Reverend_Roscoe considering its a 5 hour stream its about time LUL
[5:08:16] <RickyRelucent> sunlight blade and sunlight lightning are cool, but those need 30 and 40 faith respectfully
[5:08:17] <Lefteron> @Reverend_Roscoe he got the bois so it was a wipe
[5:08:18] <+rumblarrock> both black knights are KOed
[5:08:26] <thefreakmuseum> did he get the gargoyle yet?
[5:08:26] <DotDusk> I did that :)
[5:08:29] <RickyRelucent> theyy changed it from 50 in actual DKS1

[5:08:45] <+derpumpkinking> does the chain armor in remake look a little....skin-like to anyone?
[5:08:51] <lotharrio> Got high with a little help, from his friends.
[5:08:52] <+cdrom321> @lefteron It's the sunlight medals that lower the requirement, right?

[5:14:58] <Johannen> Gotta know your startups and recovery frames)
[5:15:02] <RyuuAoi> What if Woolie carries the salt over from Dokapon to the DS streams, and starts to fuck over Reggie's LP? Ha

[5:17:43] <RickyRelucent> There's some he'll come across soon
[5:17:54] <DSD24> Burn him to ashes
[5:17:57] <@Menitta> the woolieONEGUY
[5:18:09] <RickyRelucent> havel, wolf, red tear
[5:18:11] <Johannen> Combustion would disagree with you Woolie, great close combat weapon replacement
[5:18:24] <Darren716> Nah
[5:18:24] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[5:18:26] <@Menitta> I'm gonna buy DS1 remastered tonight.
[5:18:27] <RickyRelucent> black flame best combustion, fuuck ur shields
[5:18:34] <%IronOhki> Bendy Tail Axe
[5:18:36] <RickyRelucent> combustion normally also spams beautifully
[5:18:42] <%cobalt_phoenix_> you have better things, it's fine
[5:18:42] <jett_eyes> Does he know what build he's going for or is he still deciding?
[5:18:45] <zzNamttamzz> The lucky BKS drop can carry you to end game if you like it
[5:18:45] <+Grayhammatter> it's a cool bendy tail axe
[5:18:46] <RickyRelucent> and combos nicely depending if u have two flames
[5:18:47] <blackpegaso> High on poison resistance
[5:18:50] <andre11dr> Damn chat, i can't wait till we see THE LEGEND
[5:18:50] <%mihokspawn> That axe is also hot Garbaaage
[5:18:52] <RickyRelucent> or put it in off, or mainhand
[5:19:09] <%cobalt_phoenix_> LUL
[5:19:12] <RickyRelucent> big dick engy with the claymore
[5:19:13] <youngking_kush> Good sesh
[5:19:14] <RickyRelucent> fan fave
[5:19:15] <+Ritty78> easy to soul farm with the aoe pyromancies too
[5:19:16] <RyuuAoi> Now DROP IT, REGGIE
[5:19:17] <Visorak6> try the zweihander
[5:19:19] <Darren716> Try Zwei next time
[5:19:26] <youngking_kush> THE BAEMORE
[5:19:29] <GeoGio3> Claymore is my love, nice choice reggie
[5:19:30] <Darren716> Learn the magic of the pancake maker
[5:19:33] <%hax_metatron> Nah stick to the Claymore
[5:19:37] <jett_eyes> He should try the halberd tho
[5:19:37] <lotharrio> Some reach is solid in these games.
[5:19:40] <PMda2nd> it could happen
[5:19:41] <RickyRelucent> chad(t) hell get there
[5:19:46] <RickyRelucent> let him make the choice naturally
[5:19:52] <%IronOhki> Claymore: Swing with R2 Stab. Halberd: Stab with R2 Swing
[5:19:54] <RickyRelucent> Maybe it will be another flavor or greatsword
[5:20:01] <BigYanno> It's actually an OK axe
[5:20:02] <Johannen> upgrading weapons is better than you would expect
[5:20:03] <@Menitta> I recommend the whip
[5:20:08] <%hiswill98> There‚Äôs always the Partizan
[5:20:09] <PMda2nd> use the emergency axe
[5:20:12] <+Grayhammatter> the rarest drop
[5:20:13] <@Menitta> Kappa
[5:20:13] <PMda2nd> ü™ì
[5:20:14] <%cobalt_phoenix_> streamer luck
[5:20:14] <+terry_quest> or ya know he could have 2h the axe to be a bit more effective
[5:20:18] <BigYanno> Claymore is a fantastic weapon tho
[5:20:20] <+ChancellorOfLights> black knight halberd farming sucks
[5:20:34] <mroldmouse> you could totally do it, anything is good at plus 10 / plus 15 or classic early fire enchant
[5:20:35] <+Amaideus> I got the BKS on my first run, immediately farmed souls to use it 2 handed, then ONESHOT THE TAURUS DEMON with a plunge attack
[5:20:36] <RickyRelucent> u can get higher percentages with gear ofc
[5:20:36] <+Ritty78> well yeah if you get the black knight sword use the black knight sword
[5:20:36] <%BisoromiBear> trident sucked my soul
[5:20:36] <%hiswill98> If you get the Black Knight Halberd you beat the game
[5:20:39] <RickyRelucent> and humanity
[5:20:40] <jett_eyes> Toothpick
[5:20:46] <RickyRelucent> buuut its always hyype
[5:20:48] <zzNamttamzz> Channeler trident NotLikeThis
[5:21:01] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Titanite catchpole
[5:21:06] <BigYanno> Baller Swag Sword ain't nuffin to fuck wiff
[5:21:08] <+cdrom321> Every. Black. Knight.
[5:21:10] <RyuuAoi> Pat should invade Reggie ha
[5:21:12] <+terry_quest> the sword and shield are the best
[5:21:14] <+Grayhammatter> i hope reggie gets the channeler trident
[5:21:15] <RickyRelucent> Earlygame i always rush forest
[5:21:23] <RickyRelucent> for the +10ember
[5:21:29] <youngking_kush> No BallerSwagSword tho
[5:21:31] <andre11dr> Imagine if Reggie sees a Vagrant and just instantly swings on him LUL
[5:21:32] <RickyRelucent> because upgrades that gud
[5:21:38] <%mihokspawn> And the helmet
[5:21:41] <QueequegTheater> And you use that humanity to grind MORE HUMANITY
[5:21:47] <RickyRelucent> big worth going around, or opening the door
[5:21:56] <+SenorCounter> I think he was the most heartbroken when you go the shield
[5:22:00] <BigYanno> I think Capra is going to get stomped
[5:22:01] <QueequegTheater> Gonna stomp all over Seath
[5:22:04] <RickyRelucent> could farm some souls off the guys behind the door too.
[5:22:07] <%hiswill98> Oneshot Capra Demon would be legendary
[5:22:23] <+ChancellorOfLights> if Capra, I riot
[5:22:29] <andre11dr> My bet is that Crapa is going to stomp Reggie for like a hour
[5:22:30] <youngking_kush> Everybodies walls are different man
[5:22:38] <QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus The Tower Knight is the largest parryable attack
[5:22:39] <Johannen> You can parry Human/ 1.5 Human sized enemies
[5:22:47] <MeImoth> 0if its human, it can probalby be parried
[5:22:49] <mroldmouse> non humanoids cannot be parried
[5:22:56] <jett_eyes> i was kinda disappointed that Gwyn was the only boss you could parry
[5:22:59] <MeImoth> giant monster? probably not
[5:23:04] <%mihokspawn> You can parry anything that behaves like a player, and a few other things
[5:23:21] <youngking_kush> Bloodborne is where you can really just parry everything
[5:23:29] <+kewlmyc> Paige making Ebriatas look like a chump will never not be funny.
[5:23:30] <+robertoszek> support the official release

[5:24:19] <CrimsonGargoyle> Mister Woolwide
[5:24:22] <QueequegTheater> Share some of that oil money
[5:24:22] <andre11dr> @jett_eyes To be fair, Gwyn being parryable kinda ruins the fight because he doesn't get to do anything
[5:24:27] <QueequegTheater> Kappa
[5:24:31] <photoniccaster> Love watching the manga so far! Will you be grinding off screen or is everything on screen?
[5:24:33] <AncyentMarinere> Mr Woolwide
[5:24:42] <ronin19xx> Its 1 AM here lol, love you Woolz
[5:25:03] <%LastHazzerd> alright, already, the show goes on all night
[5:25:05] <andre11dr> 00:30 over here
[5:25:25] <slippery_arms> having a guide in this game is nice cause alot of stuff is so esoteric
[5:25:25] <%hiswill98> That‚Äôs why dissections of these games are always so interesting
[5:25:25] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1455421207659139081?t=Np244HCpRXfSBOkB2__Gpw&s=19
[5:25:27] <ronin19xx> @Breaknoon Literally broke the record for the hottest place on earth earlier this year
[5:25:30] <RyuuAoi> Yeah I got cash app if you wanna share dat gas shmoney
[5:25:38] <slothtouchingcloth> Yes we live in different time zones
[5:25:54] <+Breaknoon> yeah, was worse heat than afghanistan
[5:26:41] <+The_Death_Owl> pick up your shield
[5:26:42] <velgaduere> SHEPHERD SOULS
[5:27:00] <noxeturna> Feet and spacing are 75% of the fight
[5:27:01] <youngking_kush> Control the battlefield, fight where YOU want
[5:27:10] <andre11dr> Pop your shield, you know what i mean
[5:27:35] <DSD24> Who was the game ender
[5:27:42] <%0ctaeder> 100%ed dark souls 1 twice
[5:27:45] <%Seancicle> HA‚ÜóÔ∏èHA‚ÜòÔ∏èHA‚ÜôÔ∏èHA‚ÜóÔ∏è
[5:27:55] <QueequegTheater> Flamelurker is brutal
[5:27:55] <huskarl_zap> flamefuker DansGame
[5:27:58] <jett_eyes> @andre11dr well afterwards I thought it kinda made sense lorewise. You're fighting Gwyn at his weakest state, and after that entire adventure after hundreds of deaths you get a piss easy boss. At first I thought "of course they'd do that" but later it kinda made sense.
[5:28:03] <smitty_werb_> maneater is rough too
[5:28:05] <dmtjinni> LUL
[5:28:06] <andre11dr> I remember what stopped me for a while, and it wasn't because it was hard
[5:28:08] <+mechslayer71> people are doodoo diaper babies, what's new
[5:28:09] <AngryAsian5> LUL
[5:28:13] <derap41> Well stacking fire resists helps
[5:28:14] <+The_Death_Owl> the real first strand type game, you can see where others go hollow
[5:28:18] <QueequegTheater> You just have to slam your head into it until you break through
[5:28:28] <RyuuAoi> I think Reggie might tap in DS2
[5:28:34] <CrimsonGargoyle> @QueequegTheater parry the wall!
[5:28:34] <youngking_kush> They went Hollow
[5:28:35] <%cobalt_phoenix_> BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD POOL
[5:28:36] <thefreakmuseum> BLOOD POOL
[5:28:41] <%BisoromiBear> YEYEYE
[5:28:46] <Jerp> someone I worked with a while back gave up at asylum demon
[5:28:46] <+Grayhammatter> DS2 is gonna be rough
[5:28:51] <thefreakmuseum> i miss the peace pool though, the spirit of camaraderie it brought
[5:28:55] <+The_Death_Owl> Fromsoft tapped in DS2 tbh rbeeWeird
[5:28:56] <kermitlive> I was the same way, I gave up on darksouls until a friend of mine helped me through it. Now I love it.
[5:29:02] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus You guys are rocking it!
[5:29:07] <QueequegTheater> @RyuuAoi why
[5:29:13] <jett_eyes> I just found it kinda lame that the game has this really useful mechanic that you use a lot but barely against any of the bosses
[5:29:17] <Afrosamasenpai> Making Grandpa Spy proud
[5:29:24] <%A_German_spy> @Afrosamasenpai You know it
[5:29:26] <CrimsonGargoyle> @kermitlive the power of FRIENDSHIP SOULS!
[5:29:26] <%Indigo_Automaton> Nice
[5:29:27] <andre11dr> Bed Of Chaos made me not play the game for a while, and it wasn't because it was hard, it was because it was bad
[5:29:39] <%Ensign_Epic> Definitely agree, Woolie was providing just the right amount of support, giving nudges when needed but not hand-holding
[5:29:43] <kermitlive> @CrimsonGargoyle the power of jolly co-operation!
[5:29:45] <RyuuAoi> @queequegtheater Those bosses, man
