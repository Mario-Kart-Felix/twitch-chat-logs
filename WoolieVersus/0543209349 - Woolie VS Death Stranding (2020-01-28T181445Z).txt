[0:44:04] <+lesquide> @yaganel Love the system, but the author has too much of an evil poop thing
[0:44:10] <+lesquide> @worldbrand Thanks!
[0:44:34] <Yaganel> @lesquide he doesn‚Äôt go far enough in my opinion
[0:44:58] <worldbrand> i think you're probably right about that yeah
[0:45:07] <Yaganel> Can‚Äôt beat schwalb
[0:45:11] <%Lion_kun> Play Yugioh
[0:45:31] <%ozzrabbit> The other part is the Fallout that‚Äôs going to come from the Podcast discussion about Dialect and Pat‚Äôs egocentrism in full view.
[0:45:45] <Yaganel> Play Drinking Quest or Drunk Quest @woolieversus
[0:46:59] <+lesquide> @Yaganel That much corpofilic humor just ain't my bag :P Big fan of a bunch of games inspired by the system, though. Lancer is just about the coolest thing in the world.
[0:47:21] <+linSP> long campaigns have big potential
[0:47:57] <Solidnick18> lol
[0:48:06] <Solidnick18> that's one way of putting it
[0:48:06] <@Solidus_113> Pat doesn't a creativity

[0:49:04] <+duneblythe> dragonlance?
[0:49:12] <+JeluxDaCasual> yeah
[0:49:12] <+steelmorrigan> Reggie was Omegadmin
[0:49:16] <+JeluxDaCasual> Dragonlance
[0:49:20] <+steelmorrigan> reggiewas the MCP
[0:49:21] <%supersugoisenpai1> but how do you win?
[0:49:25] <Graxe_> Pat needs strict win/lose conditions
[0:49:26] <Dwarven_Gaming> you need a good dm
[0:49:27] <Solidnick18> he's old
[0:49:28] <Graxe_> Or it's not a game
[0:49:32] <%solzan2000> lol
[0:49:35] <Graxe_> Because you have to win or lose in a game
[0:49:36] <+skiassassin> We need woolie D&D streams
[0:49:40] <+JeluxDaCasual> BUT HOW DO YOU WIN?!
[0:49:46] <+zanzibar_junker> Luv u Reggie
[0:49:50] <+agumon9000> How do you win?
[0:50:01] <@Solidus_113> Pat was so latched onto the board game aspect he didn't understand it was more of a cooperative experience that you don't "win"
[0:50:11] <+skiassassin> @WoolieVersus Dungeon master woolie manifests actual mind goblins for pat to fight
[0:50:28] <+lesquide> If Woolie streams full-on Tabletop RPGs, I hope they're something more interesting than D&D. There's a lot of cool mecha and martial arts games out there.
[0:50:46] <+skiassassin> @lesquide Lancer?
[0:50:46] <+lesquide> Crazy to hear he did Dialect, though!
[0:50:47] <+agumon9000> @woolieversus Yo did you see that the Kirby Air Ride copy right got renewed by Nintendo?
[0:50:52] <The_Grand_J> i just finished watching the clip

[0:51:20] <+skiassassin> Make pat fight the mindgoblins
[0:51:30] <@Solidus_113> Reggie was a fantastic antagonist
[0:51:35] <+lesquide> @skiassassin A game about mech pilots in the far future. Is linking OK in here?
[0:51:37] <+skiassassin> Better yet
[0:51:42] <+steelmorrigan> So CP 2020 oneshot WHen?
[0:51:44] <+PenmanLupine> never gotta take your mental disorders seriously when you imagine them as funny little goblins for other people to laugh with.
[0:52:03] <+skiassassin> @WoolieVersus Make pat play as a mind goblin and watch him implode
[0:52:05] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @lesquide
[0:52:05] <Solidnick18> pat has fought his brain goblins... he hasn't won yet @skiassassin
[0:52:16] <worldbrand> i mean i do appreciate that mind goblins is a succinct term that gets across that it's not really something you have entirely under control
[0:52:18] <+skiassassin> Mind Goblin Pat the Rogue
[0:52:39] <%The_Timo> Well I mean D&D oneshots are also doable
[0:52:42] <%DesertPenguin> We will all watch everything you do because we love you

[0:53:01] <Solidnick18> big fight game family
[0:53:04] <%DesertPenguin> But the punchy kicky games are fine

[2:13:29] <MyNameIsRasus> isn't 21 minutes enough time for massive brain damage
[2:13:34] <DatAsuna> *AC/DC plays*
[2:13:57] <+linSP> give this man a like to ease his pain
[2:14:00] <QaizerArt> like i said, heartman is easily the most interesting character
[2:14:00] <%GeneralSCPatton> And what's he gonna do when he finds them? Get defibbed again?
[2:14:01] <+Mkingston> Is the video out of sync?
[2:14:01] <Tucker0603> cheesyness aside, that's a fucked up thing to experience

[2:14:39] <+johnny_gogo> yo its almost time
[2:14:59] <MyNameIsRasus> @captain_history dope
[2:15:09] <QaizerArt> If @DatAsuna is right, @MrRabbles, then this cutscene is 21 minutes long, just as long Heartman stays alive

[2:15:36] <QaizerArt> rip
[2:15:37] <DatAsuna> It's 21 mins for both of these cycles
[2:15:38] <derap41> The Dinosaur extinction even was a minor one fun fact

[2:15:41] <Solidnick18> LUL
[2:15:45] <+linSP> take me to dino afterlife
[2:15:50] <DatAsuna> So time in this scene is 2x
[2:15:52] <MayorRev> BAD MOVE
[2:16:00] <+blackreaper_k_> I wonder if the 21 minutes thing is a reference to the supposed "weight of the soul". When a person dies, their body loses 21 grams of mass after death.
[2:16:05] <DatAsuna> He's doing the 21 min cycles in 10 mins of cutscene
[2:16:14] <DatAsuna> 10 and a halfish
[2:16:21] <+jiggy_snipe> oh ok
[2:16:28] <uncle_christian> soon

[2:20:07] <Solidnick18> but people love it
[2:20:08] <NotHereToStream> We hate it sooo much, but listen, its so honest and stupid that its sincere and endearing
[2:20:08] <+agumon9000> Do the 3 come back too heartman then you can stop and do the other orders for Sam
[2:20:11] <uncle_christian> Woolie looks 45 because of KoJumbo

[2:20:56] <QaizerArt> Kojima is basically just Ultra Instinct all the time
[2:20:57] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Honestly if they held him back so hard it would just be another boring AAA game with boring usual shit
[2:20:57] <uncle_christian> Isolate this speech and feature it. <3
[2:20:59] <MayorRev> ULTRA INSTINCT KOJIMA
[2:21:03] <+theCatastrophy> Breaking my schlock limiters
[2:21:09] <NotHereToStream> yeaa boi
[2:21:09] <Solidnick18> unchained from the konami basement
[2:21:11] <+Mkingston> Kojima is Elfin Lied
[2:21:13] <+jiggy_snipe> that's why we love him
[2:21:27] <uncle_christian> XD : : :
[2:21:27] <GarrisonWaifu> Subtlety is for cowards
[2:21:28] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:21:32] <+drfaustisdead> That is why Kojima is an actual video game Auteur.
[2:21:43] <Solidnick18> We got you know a HEART lake
[2:21:43] <+theCatastrophy> Super Schlockian Juego

[2:22:25] <%Irridium> I love Kojumbo

[2:22:30] <%GeneralSCPatton> sweetc2Gasm hellow22loody hellow22booty hellow2Face hellow2Blush hellow2Oh
[2:22:32] <alrobot2014> hey if the ass staring works it works
[2:22:33] <Graxe_> Thermal pads
[2:22:34] <+jiggy_snipe> Silent Hills would have been nuts
[2:22:35] <@Solidus_113> I never found a good use for these pads
[2:22:38] <+drfaustisdead> Yo get you some thermal pads!
[2:22:39] <QaizerArt> He's that one guy you just love to hate.
[2:22:43] <NotHereToStream> thermal pad is kind of useless imo
[2:22:43] <uncle_christian> Wherfe do we go from here Kojima?
[2:22:52] <Solidnick18> i never used them i think they are a waste
[2:23:02] <QaizerArt> Really, Solidus? Those things are mad useful during mountain times.
[2:23:11] <@Solidus_113> ehh
[2:23:16] <+Mkingston> I never used a Thermal Pad
[2:23:23] <uncle_christian> Can we burn down Heartman mansion?
[2:23:28] <startstoprepeat> they don't tell you this, but they negate container degradation from the snow which is crazy useful
[2:23:38] <Solidnick18> i finished the mountin off so fast i was like fuck all of that mountin
[2:23:39] <QaizerArt> Your stamina I think basically decreases by like .5 the time
[2:23:49] <+tuchpi> damn im late forsenAngry
[2:23:55] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @uncle_christian
[2:23:57] <%Irridium> @startstoprepeat they do what now
[2:24:09] <Djinnazz> Fuck thermal pads, they just waste battery
[2:24:31] <QaizerArt> Dude they are crazy helpful on the mountain
[2:24:37] <%supersugoisenpai1> Stamina drains pretty fast in this area without them
[2:24:44] <QaizerArt> you just get them way late for them to be more useful
[2:24:49] <%domokun124> not a problem if you know how to manage battery levels and get the good batteries
[2:24:59] <@Solidus_113> I'd rather just use shelters to restore packages
[2:25:17] <@Solidus_113> and you always have so much Monster Energy to get stamina back
[2:25:18] <uncle_christian> Heartman has no fancy truck/Bike?
[2:25:29] <QaizerArt> If other players ain't built them and you ain't carrying PCCs, tho
[2:25:59] <derap41> ....yeah lets nuke the fossils
[2:26:08] <Solidnick18> the bomb...
[2:26:09] <QaizerArt> 3rd, rather
[2:26:09] <+tuchpi> more ghost tar
[2:26:11] <Tucker0603> don't pull a Pat though
[2:26:12] <uncle_christian> Melt the Flintstones
[2:26:15] <%GeneralSCPatton> GAME OVER YEEEEEAAAAAH
[2:26:24] <+tuchpi> BUT!
[2:26:28] <Djinnazz> By this time in the game they were just a hinderance
[2:26:36] <Solidnick18> you could do both
[2:26:53] <+Mkingston> Pat fucking bubblefucked the bomb mission to the nth degree
[2:27:09] <+linSP> guess who made a stumbo with the anti matter bomb apatSmug
[2:27:16] <derap41> Who uses a nuke to dig up fossiles like talk about overkill

[2:29:24] <Tucker0603> dude it said that to begin with
[2:29:30] <+drfaustisdead> And that's why I never used carriers.
[2:30:04] <%domokun124> I never noticed any significant loss in Crystals I always picked up more than I was losing
[2:30:43] <+Javaa01> That ringing sound is actually just to indicate snowfall, it's an auditory easter egg
[2:30:50] <Pappajimbo> i finished the came with 50,000 crystals so using the carriers was not an issue
[2:30:53] <@Solidus_113> remember to check your weather map too
[2:30:56] <+linSP> sometimes i would go out boss bt hunting for fun, had more crystals than to do with

[2:41:57] <Tucker0603> my brother takes a fucking hour long shower, HE FUCKED UP OUR BATHROOM
[2:41:57] <The_Grand_J> BRO a shower is 10 max
[2:42:06] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> MINH?
[2:42:08] <@Solidus_113> if you're in for 10 you're not actually cleaning
[2:42:14] <derap41> Don't you need to with the dreads
[2:42:20] <worldbrand> a shower is 5-25 for me, a bath is 40-120 minutes
[2:42:22] <Sartastic> depends how long/thick ur hair is
[2:42:23] <DatAsuna> take your time to think
[2:42:28] <%bread_assassin> That's fair.
[2:42:31] <derap41> 10 min for cleaning 30 for crying
[2:42:32] <+ChiefWilly> i do that too, great reflection time

[2:43:51] <Sartastic> do you wipe?
[2:43:52] <Djinnazz> I don‚Äôt get why ppl shit for so long. I can shot faster than I can piss

[2:43:59] <Djinnazz> Shit
[2:44:01] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> LUL
[2:44:02] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> oh boy

[2:44:06] <Tucker0603> SPRAY THAT BITCH
[2:44:07] <Sartastic> @Djinn IBS
[2:44:11] <%Irridium> don't fall!
[2:44:13] <%The_Timo> Timefall snow ain't kidding around
[2:44:16] <jeybull13> lol
[2:44:50] <+agumon9000> Luckily Container damage doesn't matter when it comes too ranking. But once the container breaks, the item inside starts taking damage from the snow and stuff
[2:44:53] <%GeneralSCPatton> The only savagery is using your hand. Any method with paper is okay.
[2:44:58] <+Taglog7> Wet front back, wet back front, dry both ways
[2:45:02] <NoireRequiem> still makes me anxious
[2:45:06] <+jiggy_snipe> Pat once fell down a hill/mountain and flew into a parked truck. It was very funny
[2:45:08] <derap41> 20 mins without phone is torture
[2:45:38] <+Javaa01> Do NOT fall on your ass
[2:45:38] <Tucker0603> SHOULDA BROUGHT SPRAY
[2:45:42] <+linSP> dying in this game isnt a game over, but its so inconvenient i end up reloading
[2:45:42] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> never needing the container spray anymore eh LUL
[2:45:47] <NoireRequiem> at least 5 minutes to load up
[2:45:49] <%The_Timo> where's that spray, didn't we tell you early on to always have one packed? lol
[2:46:05] <@Solidus_113> could you optimize the cargo so the containers are in the bag?
[2:46:07] <Picosunloaded> back when I was in JROTC you learn to get up fast
[2:46:13] <%Irridium> just take out your spra- oh right

[2:47:37] <+AsinPersuasion> this is some skryim tier shit
[2:47:48] <NoireRequiem> just save for days prior for rapid finish
[2:47:50] <%The_Timo> Would have loved to see woolie get smoked by a boulder
[2:47:59] <Rosy_Joan> Is this just Choke Jerking?
[2:47:59] <+GarbageNirvana> Time it to finish the moment your heart stops
[2:48:06] <KnivesEve> reset the mission
[2:48:09] <Picosunloaded> @Solidus_113 20 minutes of edge and the last minute to unleash
[2:48:14] <worldbrand> FOUR?

[2:48:26] <NoireRequiem> each quadrant LUL
[2:48:31] <%supersugoisenpai1> you can still S if you dont drop it
[2:48:33] <derap41> It was a spooky ghost
[2:48:36] <@Solidus_113> you need at least a minute to cleanup and think about what you've done
[2:48:42] <+jiggy_snipe> Randy Marsh agrees
[2:48:47] <+AsinPersuasion> petition to have woolie make leroy's theme song his theme song since they're the same person?
[2:48:50] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> what is ur plan Woolie
[2:48:51] <DatAsuna> I once walked in on my roommate with a 3 monitor setup to ask about something
[2:48:52] <+MrRabbles> mountain goat
[2:48:54] <Picosunloaded> nah you wear it with pride
[2:48:57] <DatAsuna> 2 of the monitors were fine
[2:48:58] <%Irridium> you know you could have just gone around right
[2:49:01] <DatAsuna> but i think he forgot
[2:49:06] <DatAsuna> about the 3rd monitor
[2:49:10] <+linSP> reggies 3 monitors with multiple tabs on each
[2:49:21] <DatAsuna> that was just a big fullscreen ass with tail buttplug
[2:49:40] <NoireRequiem> reggies batcomputer screen of tabs

[2:49:43] <%GeneralSCPatton> @datasuna sweetc2Gasm
[2:50:24] <DatAsuna> i do have to close chrome sometimes when I'm editing videos on laptop lol
[2:50:45] <Graxe_> Multiple browser windows each filled with tabs
[2:50:50] <+Taglog7> close em all. I don't even
[2:50:56] <+VHGS> Good, figure out the strats now. You only get to die while fapping once.
[2:50:59] <+MrRabbles> very diverse pornography portfolio
[2:50:59] <+linSP> what is your tabs high score reggie
[2:51:00] <@Solidus_113> When i'm editing there's nothing else open on my PC. Not even Discord
[2:51:02] <OldManDeckardCain> getting off to cnn fake news LUL
[2:51:04] <NoireRequiem> multi layered proxy tabs
[2:51:31] <+Javaa01> @Solidus_113 Yeah, but your PC lights on fire if you try to do two things at once
[2:51:34] <DatAsuna> my desktop can brute force renders with other stuff going, but my laptop mkes it a risky play
[2:51:40] <@Solidus_113> yeah it does
[2:51:52] <%The_Timo> You need that backpack cover for these trips
[2:51:54] <+GarbageNirvana> Nice Star Trek cosplay
[2:52:02] <DatAsuna> luckily mine has okay specs, it's just literally falling apart
[2:52:10] <DatAsuna> as in the shell not longer stays together
[2:52:21] <NoireRequiem> @GarbageNirvana felt too shy to call out his captain kirk costume too
[2:52:23] <DatAsuna> and the grooves for the screws are now bigger than the screws
[2:52:36] <@Solidus_113> My CPU is 57c right now
[2:52:39] <DatAsuna> so if I pick up the laptop the wrong way my carhging port slide sideways
[2:52:51] <DatAsuna> or it slides back inside the laptop
[2:52:55] <+linSP> is it bad im at a constant 90c
[2:53:00] <+Taglog7> Kreygasm
[2:53:04] <DatAsuna> and I have to pry it open farther to reposition it
[2:53:12] <@Solidus_113> 90 is actually killing your PC. that shit is melting
[2:53:20] <NoireRequiem> 10 mins tops
[2:53:22] <%GeneralSCPatton> @datasuna God hath blighted you
[2:53:28] <Picosunloaded> smoothie that shit
[2:53:29] <DatAsuna> And yes 90 is bad
[2:53:29] <+ChiefWilly> Man... i eat food in like 5 minutes
[2:53:32] <+linSP> dam.. im too lit
[2:53:36] <Monkeyweed21> just eat a sandwich
[2:53:40] <DatAsuna> have a look at your cooling solution
[2:53:43] <@Solidus_113> 90 for video cards are okay, but for CPU that's raw death
[2:53:44] <masterfire23> my pc cant get past 47
[2:53:50] <+Javaa01> 90 is the safe limit, after THAT it starts to become a real problem
[2:54:14] <+linSP> i got some liquid cooling too, might be dust
[2:54:18] <DatAsuna> I actually switched from a water pump to a fan sink in my desktop
[2:54:39] <DatAsuna> but the fan has a GIANT heat sink so it works out still pretty quiet
[2:54:40] <Prevot> Dino Stranding
[2:54:40] <@Solidus_113> If you're at 90 with liquid you should stop using it or change the liquid
[2:54:41] <NoireRequiem> (he said the thing)
[2:54:42] <Camail> 90c is the typical limit people use when pushing their overclocking
[2:55:08] <+linSP> could also be all my tabs of woolie
[2:55:10] <@Solidus_113> thermal paste probably needs changing too
[2:55:23] <DatAsuna> you're supposed to reup the paste once a year
[2:55:28] <DatAsuna> but barely anyone does
[2:55:29] <%gatorafan> Dinosaurs on the beach have feathers Kappa
[2:55:32] <+Taglog7> Keep dino beach weird
[2:55:32] <@Solidus_113> depending on use
[2:55:34] <Prevot> is this the dino crisis reboot I asked for?
[2:55:40] <Breakfast_Megapowers> Wait are WE the chat, the Death Stranding all along?
[2:55:57] <%DesertPenguin> Anyone find game audio low compared to the guys?
[2:56:02] <Picosunloaded> get that spray boy
[2:56:05] <+linSP> ngl thermal paste is the messiest stuff and i avoided reapplying it for that reason
[2:56:09] <@Solidus_113> 6 Months is usually a good time to clean the paste if you're doing a lot of high-def gaming
[2:56:15] <@Solidus_113> or rendering
[2:56:28] <+GarbageNirvana> Bonus
[2:56:31] <%GeneralSCPatton> DOUBLE FAMILY
[2:56:34] <Breakfast_Megapowers> sent to SUPER hell
[2:56:41] <+GarbageNirvana> Just katamari all your families together
[2:57:01] <derap41> Can't wait for the sequel
[2:57:03] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:57:06] <+Taglog7> LUL LUL LUL
[2:57:39] <DatAsuna> thermal paste is less scary than placing it tbh
[2:57:43] <@Solidus_113> paste is super easy to put on. Just grab a couple q-tips clean the heatsink and CPU with rubbing alcohol, then apply a literal Pea-sized dot in the middle of the CPU, put the sink back on and you're done
[2:57:53] <DatAsuna> the paste you can kinda mess up but you probably won't
[2:58:10] <DatAsuna> seating the cpu wrong and you can just fuck the pins and make it useless
[2:58:18] <DatAsuna> though granted it is still easy
[2:58:23] <DatAsuna> just higher risk easy
[2:58:41] <+GarbageNirvana> As long as you're not putting so much on that it's oozing out of the sides it's fine
[2:59:01] <DatAsuna> draw a dickbutt with the thermal paste
[2:59:15] <@Solidus_113> Paste being too thick is almost as bad as having no paste at all
[2:59:24] <+linSP> i hear sone people say a rice grain of paste is enough, others are like slather that shit
[2:59:28] <+GarbageNirvana> Also most Intel processors are LGA as opposed to PGA so there's no pins to fuck up there
[2:59:52] <%supersugoisenpai1> that is a shit zipline
[2:59:58] <+agumon9000> Press the touch pad to do the HEY thing. It can make more possibly appear
[3:00:17] <Nested_Dreams> I'd recommend spreading only if you can't see how it applied after assembly
[3:00:20] <%AurysGryphon> AurysGryphon subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[3:00:45] <Nested_Dreams> Like when replacing paste in a laptop
[3:01:38] <+linSP> i feel like spreading it manually might make it too thin, especially with a card
[3:02:06] <Nested_Dreams> I hope one day I'll have the balls to try liquid metal thermal compound
[3:03:02] <%The_Timo> that would be just the worst timing
[3:03:20] <+Proxzo> is there any new thermal paste tech?
[3:03:23] <Solidnick18> that's steep
[3:03:24] <+GarbageNirvana> BTBs
[3:03:26] <karl_rex> Oh man
[3:03:30] <+Proxzo> I think i just put the line and that's it
[3:03:55] <Solidnick18> OH
[3:03:58] <+Proxzo> I feel like...there needs to be new thermal paste application tech
[3:04:01] <Solidnick18> monkaS
[3:04:37] <+Proxzo> they should soak that rope in monster

[3:04:55] <Solidnick18> OH
[3:04:56] <Breakfast_Megapowers> I suggest that we in chat descend into cannibalism of eachother while we are on this mountain
[3:04:57] <Solidnick18> shit

[3:46:30] <%artilleryZero> Do a fuckin hoverboard christ air to your destination
[3:46:32] <bakersvile> @QaizerArt Ah ok thank you
[3:46:36] <QaizerArt> Np
[3:46:55] <+Apokrypton> use the bomb as a sled to get to your destination faster
[3:46:58] <QaizerArt> Just ride the anti-matter nuke down the mountain like THUG2
[3:47:34] <QaizerArt> hell yeah (applies high-fives to @Apokrypton)
[3:47:43] <%artilleryZero> then bam margera shoots die hardman in the balls with a tennis ball

[3:49:07] <@Solidus_113> JUMP IT
[3:49:09] <QaizerArt> Sled down the mountain on the nuke, Christ Air and then dunk it on a big BT
[3:49:19] <@Solidus_113> nice
[3:49:21] <theobble> moon2VERYSCARED
[3:49:27] <+jiggy_snipe> Lou likes it though
[3:49:28] <+MrRabbles> Lou loves it
[3:49:34] <Tucker0603> DOUBLE JUMP
[3:49:40] <+MrRabbles> this is to go even further beyond
[3:49:41] <xoyv> lou the hypeman
[3:49:46] <+Zerodyne90> doodCrazy

[3:49:48] <+Apokrypton> advanced UPS deliveryman tech
[3:49:49] <+Taisuru> Yeah pat was jumpin all over the place with a bomb
[3:50:01] <QaizerArt> Wait no you can double jump at anytime ya silly bill.
[3:50:11] <%GeneralSCPatton> You can double jump as long as your percent weight is low enough
[3:50:12] <theobble> BlessRNG explode
[3:50:14] <arkv01> you've done the big maths
[3:50:42] <QaizerArt> if woolie eats shit down the mountain i will draw it
[3:50:59] <zayasu> eat shit BlessRNG
[3:51:38] <+linSP> i always get a little nervous when my ups guy double jumps to my front door with my antimatter
[3:51:52] <QaizerArt> i'm just reminded of Ralph being 'haha, i'm in danger' as woolie does this
[3:52:57] <%artilleryZero> Also, woolie should have put all his gear in the timefall sock and the bomb outside. Just spray some lysol on it to heal it every now and then
[3:53:04] <+MrRabbles> fine
[3:53:29] <+Apokrypton> yeah it seems like putting anything that doesn't have a container in the timefall tent is a good idea
[3:53:54] <%artilleryZero> Downside is if you trip and fall, itll fall off...
[3:54:02] <xoyv> so if woolie eats it down the mountain, what music do you think min will add, mario 64, or mario party?
[3:54:06] <%artilleryZero> So maybe it was a good idea for him to keep it in there lol
[3:54:12] <+Apokrypton> true
[3:54:17] <@Solidus_113> check the weather map for BTs I suppose
[3:54:20] <+Apokrypton> also it's gotta be the sliding minigame from mario 64
[3:54:56] <CaptCatastrophe> Auto organizing your shit will give you a better center of mass.
[3:55:04] <%artilleryZero> Its really easy to avoid BTS in the mountains. You can just go anywhere around them if you have enough ladders :P

[3:58:17] <%DesertPenguin> !uptime
[3:58:17] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 58 minutes
[3:58:44] <+Apokrypton> yeah the actual answer is there's a fucking LOT of tar
[3:58:50] <theobble> I do that in XIV all the time. White tux and shades in the cutscenes maxes out that vibe.
[3:59:04] <%artilleryZero> lol yeah, hope he checks it out, I never thought to
[3:59:07] <+Javaa01> Yeah, that square is an optional prepper If I remember rightly
[3:59:17] <+Javaa01> But you should totally go hit them up
[3:59:33] <FullMetalMilitia> wha-hey, a woolie stream at the same time as a barry stream? what are the odds?
[3:59:49] <%GeneralSCPatton> INSIGHT GAINED
[4:01:34] <%artilleryZero> omastaaaaar
[4:01:56] <QaizerArt> Barry from Game Grumps, FullMetal?
[4:02:22] <FullMetalMilitia> @QaizerArt indeed
[4:02:22] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:02:32] <+Apokrypton> !MOTIVATED
[4:02:32] <@Moobot> 583 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[4:03:01] <%supersugoisenpai1> Purge the outies. keep it pure
[4:03:15] <@Solidus_113> smelly vog
[4:03:17] <QaizerArt> Tuesdays are surprisingly popular for stream days
[4:03:36] <@Solidus_113> this mission is super quick
[4:03:41] <mankeyfigh> Yo chat, how far are they from THE END?
[4:03:49] <@Solidus_113> many hours
[4:04:00] <@Solidus_113> dozens even
[4:04:02] <%artilleryZero> Still very much a while
[4:04:11] <mankeyfigh> still huh
[4:04:38] <Nested_Dreams> They will not be on the The End slope until they are done with the area
[4:04:39] <QaizerArt> If Woolie pushed it, he could probably finish in a few hours
[4:04:41] <yousayyugi> like 45 - 50 with all 5 stars prepers
[4:04:51] <Nested_Dreams> But muh 5 stars though
[4:05:16] <derap41> @Quarkee With how Woolie plays it i'd be closer to a week
[4:05:20] <mankeyfigh> Somehow I thought I got the idea Woolie let slip he was one or two streams away
[4:05:56] <+Apokrypton> i'd say he's like maybe two streams after this one away
[4:06:04] <QaizerArt> If he keeps off-stream 5-starring, @mankeyfigh that's actually not off, really.
[4:06:52] <Nested_Dreams> Next part of the game is really stream friendly so yeah
[4:06:55] <@Solidus_113> you know that gas only repairs for as long as you're in the range, right? The longer you stay in the more cargo gets fixed
[4:07:06] <QaizerArt> i swear to god i had that same safe room. how the fuck do some of the structures work?
[4:07:26] <QaizerArt> like seriously, if it gets enough likes does it just show up in most people's games?
[4:07:27] <+Apokrypton> i think it uses dark souls rules a little, the more highly rated something is, the more likely it is to show up
[4:07:38] <%fullmetalheartx> wut
[4:07:41] <mankeyfigh> Idk why, I never skip cutscenes in this game AM I CRAZY??
[4:07:47] <+Apokrypton> yes
[4:07:52] <T_Sasquatch> Yes
[4:08:03] <QaizerArt> yes
[4:08:05] <mankeyfigh> they don't bother me
[4:08:09] <+Apokrypton> i'm not looking at my dead mom's face every time i recycle my timefall resistant underwear
[4:08:11] <+Apokrypton> i refuse
[4:08:15] <QaizerArt> well, more power to you
[4:08:18] <@Solidus_113> Sandal weed is like insoles
[4:08:21] <derap41> They are elaves that can be made into boots
[4:08:35] <QaizerArt> the same shower scene 200 times in a row is a bit much
[4:08:35] <xoyv> insoles?
[4:08:36] <Nested_Dreams> It looks at both likes and density in the area, like it will not place bridges next to each other ever, and it will try to put anything in unpopular places
[4:08:51] <Nested_Dreams> the placement code, I mean
[4:08:57] <@Solidus_113> the fabric inside your shoes that make it not hurt to walk
[4:08:58] <QaizerArt> the things in your shoes that comfort your feet instead of being on bare rubber
[4:09:07] <+linSP> natures dr scholls
[4:09:21] <QaizerArt> shit, could use me some sandalweed for my shoes
[4:09:32] <mankeyfigh> I'm happy Woolie likes this game, I was really worried he wouldn't
[4:09:33] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1222044563210145793?s=19
[4:09:34] <+Apokrypton> but yeah, woolie's got this last little loop, then the setup for edge knot, then actually getting to edge knot, then another thing, then another thing, then another BIG LONG thing, then a cutscene marathon, before the end
[4:10:04] <QaizerArt> not incredibly far away from the end though
[4:10:18] <+Apokrypton> i mean yeah i'd call him somewhere between 3/4 and 4/5ths done
[4:10:22] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[4:10:31] <@Solidus_113> do the mission and get the extra bandwith
[4:10:43] <CaptCatastrophe> Like 5 or 6 hours from the end
[4:10:45] <QaizerArt> like i said, if he pushes it hard enough, he could probably finish the game in a stream.
[4:10:58] <mankeyfigh> I haven't been watching the streams or videos to avoid some plot spoilers, but what's been his reaction to the plot so far?
[4:11:03] <+Apokrypton> that's 5 or 6 hours for normal people, woolie tax adds 50%
[4:11:06] <CaptCatastrophe> cut scenes allown at the end are 2 hours
[4:11:08] <zayasu> just dismantle stuff you dont need from the map
[4:11:11] <@Solidus_113> hard pushing only goes as fast as the remaining cutscenes
[4:11:21] <@Solidus_113> which is still multiple hours
[4:11:25] <+Apokrypton> i'd call him like 8 hours out at least
[4:11:26] <Nested_Dreams> Woolie wants to know more of the plot and the game slowly provides
[4:11:41] <QaizerArt> well true, but the remaining hours of cutscenes would work into a stream
[4:11:52] <@Solidus_113> the punch doesn't kill
[4:11:53] <zayasu> monkaS
[4:12:01] <@Solidus_113> that info you got was completely baseless
[4:12:08] <+Apokrypton> yeah the only lethal stuff is labelled BIG LETHAL iirc
[4:12:14] <+Apokrypton> fuckin trucks aren't lethal
[4:12:22] <Solidnick18> I tested it out it doesn't kill lol
[4:12:25] <QaizerArt> woolie confirmed for becoming future machete man but with fists instead of machete
[4:12:48] <Nested_Dreams> Trucks don't kill, they just Isekai MULEs if you hit them hard enough
[4:12:57] <mankeyfigh> Whenever I see someone play this game, and they don't constantly R2 to scan, I get anxiety
[4:13:09] <QaizerArt> Isn't it R1?
[4:13:09] <+Apokrypton> oh also is woolie aware of the email rule for ranking people up
[4:13:12] <+Apokrypton> yes
[4:13:22] <+linSP> has anyone parked on top of a mule yet
[4:13:30] <Solidnick18> that's a gas mask
[4:13:35] <QaizerArt> ye, still doesn't kill them
[4:13:37] <@Solidus_113> keep the gas out
[4:13:37] <Prevot> we ludens now
[4:13:38] <QaizerArt> thankfully
[4:13:42] <startstoprepeat> i wish you could wear that all the time
[4:13:54] <@Solidus_113> take off the heating pads to save battery
[4:13:58] <+Apokrypton> ^
[4:14:11] <Djinnazz> Take those pads off
[4:14:11] <Solidnick18> fuck the heating pads
[4:14:11] <+Apokrypton> honestly fuck heating pads, i've never run out of monster so why conserve stamina
[4:14:14] <+freeizone> kojima predicted coronavirus
[4:14:16] <QaizerArt> (i totally kept running down MULEs when i found out it doesn't kill, it's too fun)
[4:14:16] <Picosunloaded> i agree take of the pads
[4:14:23] <+Apokrypton> thanks reggie
[4:14:46] <Solidnick18> reggie SeemsGood
[4:14:54] <QaizerArt> shit man, i ran out a lot of monster
[4:14:58] <mankeyfigh> I just beat up the mules when I encounter them, like BTs
[4:15:08] <QaizerArt> your playstyle determines your death style
[4:15:10] <+Apokrypton> i just never drank unless i was missing like half my bar
[4:15:11] <+drfaustisdead> At least not removing the pads isn't a big deal since they only power on when you need them.
[4:15:18] <@Solidus_113> it says in the mission breifing
[4:15:22] <@Solidus_113> like 80KG
[4:15:56] <Solidnick18> down the hole
[4:15:58] <+Apokrypton> no you put the otter hood on so the oxygen mask went off
[4:16:01] <+Apokrypton> i think??
[4:16:40] <@Solidus_113> gas
[4:16:41] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:16:42] <CaptCatastrophe> why need floating carriers? maybe just dont have all that useless shit
[4:16:46] <+Javaa01> Nah, it's just a fart gas pit
[4:16:48] <startstoprepeat> VOG
[4:16:54] <@Solidus_113> that's the hood
[4:16:57] <@Solidus_113> of otter
[4:17:02] <+linSP> lets go huff some vog bro
[4:17:04] <CaptCatastrophe> walk into teh fat gass and die
[4:17:08] <+Javaa01> It's on the second page
[4:17:12] <+MrRabbles> do not worry the otter shall protect LUL
[4:17:16] <Solidnick18> that's poison gas
[4:17:27] <+Apokrypton> woolie figured it out
[4:17:30] <+linSP> vog is volcanic fog
[4:17:35] <+jiggy_snipe> noxious fart gas
[4:17:40] <+MrRabbles> it would have been funny if he wore the otter down
[4:17:46] <xSettingSunx> Might wanna put a generator down there
[4:17:57] <+Apokrypton> nah you don't drain that fast
[4:18:16] <+Apokrypton> okay actually yeah that's pretty fast holy shit
[4:18:20] <@Solidus_113> slick
[4:18:36] <xSettingSunx> Holy fuck that sticky gun helps
[4:18:40] <startstoprepeat> it's weird how there's only like three places in the entire game with vog
[4:18:43] <+MrRabbles> good shit
[4:18:46] <Picosunloaded> sick
[4:18:47] <+Apokrypton> three??? i only saw this one
[4:18:49] <%supersugoisenpai1> there is a data chip down there too
[4:18:53] <+zanzibar_junker> Fuckin A
[4:18:54] <@Solidus_113> there's also the vog decoy cargo
[4:18:58] <Solidnick18> that's op
[4:19:29] <+Javaa01> Take off the mask now that you don't need it
[4:19:34] <@Solidus_113> mask kills your battery SO QUICK
[4:19:43] <startstoprepeat> @Apokrypton there's a crater by the filmmaker i think and i'm sure there's another one near here
[4:20:13] <+Apokrypton> huh. i didn't get every prepper either tbf so it makes sense i'd miss stuff
[4:20:47] <startstoprepeat> i tried to do every optional mission before giving up around the 300 mark and they send you to some places you probably wouldn't see otherwise
[4:22:14] <+linSP> i could never get the hidden prepper near middle knot to join despite all the ps4's i retrieved for him
[4:22:26] <+Apokrypton> did you read his emails
[4:22:37] <Solidnick18> lol
[4:22:41] <@Solidus_113> emails are the end of the stream
[4:22:47] <BurdRightsActivist> Neanderthals aren't extinct, and I'm proof of that 4Head
[4:22:49] <+Apokrypton> if you don't read people's emails they won't level right
[4:22:50] <pirateofpie> LUL
[4:23:03] <Nested_Dreams> Immaculate PraiseIt
[4:23:10] <+linSP> dam probably left him on unread
[4:23:22] <BurdRightsActivist> @Apokrypton You can get bonus likes for reading them, but it's mostly just likes you get for delivering to them
[4:23:27] <xoyv> knee deep in the tar
[4:23:41] <Prevot> Pokemon tells me omanyte lays eggs so these guys are full of shit
[4:23:41] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:23:52] <BurdRightsActivist> Praise Helix
[4:24:00] <+Apokrypton> i don't think that's right, i dumped a shitload of missions into multiple people and they didn't actually finish a star until i read their email, gave them one piece of garbage, and then they boosted up
[4:24:14] <BurdRightsActivist> @Apokrypton Damn
[4:24:17] <xoyv> heartman's got movies
[4:24:19] <+jiggy_snipe> he pauses them
[4:24:26] <zayasu> PogChamp
[4:24:31] <+DRAGKUDO> he has to skip the op and ED
[4:24:33] <+Apokrypton> heartman fucking loves bleach
[4:24:41] <arkv01> anime keeps heartman alive VoHiYo
[4:24:42] <Picosunloaded> doodNuts zoneSmug
[4:24:45] <zayasu> TPcrunchyroll
[4:24:46] <+Apokrypton> heartman has seen all of one piece
[4:24:53] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Tucker0603
[4:24:59] <+Apokrypton> f
[4:25:01] <arkv01> the moment you utter "yayo yayo"...
[4:25:05] <xoyv> heartman talking about his favorite series but how he HATES filler episodes
[4:25:13] <%fullmetalheartx> so hammm
[4:25:31] <%gatorafan> @apokrypton, One Piece STILL hasn't ended
[4:25:34] <+Apokrypton> heartman leaving imdb reviews like "this episode was so filler i literally died watching it"
[4:25:37] <+Apokrypton> yeah in the current year
[4:25:47] <CaptCatastrophe> Big ghosts ahead
[4:25:53] <%fullmetalheartx> so heartman skips OPs and EDs?
[4:25:53] <+Apokrypton> this is the fucked up hidalgo kojumbo future
[4:26:18] <xoyv> getting that sticky icky tar
[4:26:24] <+Apokrypton> @WoolieVersus you're gonna wanna go light for this, the stuff you're picking up is big iirc
[4:26:35] <@Solidus_113> he's got a carrier for it
[4:26:43] <+mrhandsss> if he's gonna do the time fall farm pizza thing at some point, today, he can pick up the veteran porter on the way. he's right next to them.
[4:26:43] <+Apokrypton> do you think he's actually gonna fuckin use it
[4:26:51] <Riorii> its 37 kg
[4:27:17] <Nested_Dreams> He will, Woolie has figured out when to use them
[4:27:19] <+Apokrypton> it's not Heavy it's just Big
[4:27:40] <+Javaa01> Take off the gas mask, you don't need to have it on draining battery life
[4:27:57] <+Javaa01> Nah, it drains at all times
[4:27:57] <+Apokrypton> it always drains
[4:27:59] <@Solidus_113> it's draining battery because it's saving you stamina
[4:28:01] <+linSP> woolie is not plagued by the mind goblins of item disuse
[4:28:06] <+mrhandsss> nope. only wear it when needed
[4:28:16] <Riorii> i think it drain when you wear it
[4:28:25] <+mrhandsss> with all that battery draining stuff he has on, he WILL notice
[4:28:28] <+Javaa01> The stamina savings are NOT worth the battery drain
[4:28:54] <+Javaa01> Uneven terrain
[4:29:24] <+mrhandsss> footpaths are so nice though. they'll even clear rocks in the way if u use them enough
[4:30:11] <+mrhandsss> wait a second.... pretty sure he's going REALLY far away from the objective if this is just the picking up packages from that guy
[4:30:26] <Nested_Dreams> Outta data cap, brb
[4:30:32] <Tucker0603> yes
[4:30:33] <Riorii> lol
[4:30:35] <+mrhandsss> the pit was like 5 feet away from that safehouse near his shelter
[4:30:51] <xSettingSunx> The vog retrieval? He finished that one a few minutes ago
[4:30:52] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1222044563210145793?s=19
[4:30:59] <%ultrasparkseid> cut to you dying
[4:31:02] <+mrhandsss> ah that. sorry i was on a cod
[4:31:02] <+jiggy_snipe> Woolie's fall will be epic and talked about for ages
[4:31:05] <+mrhandsss> vod*
[4:31:12] <Tucker0603> @woolieversus well you did put a 30m ladder on a 60m cliff and attempt to climb down it.
[4:31:14] <+mrhandsss> and now i switched to live when i got close to the end
[4:31:35] <+jiggy_snipe> yea you sent them to the other side
[4:31:39] <+Javaa01> Sending it BACK
[4:31:45] <+jiggy_snipe> they're happy :)
[4:31:46] <Prevot> monkaS
[4:31:52] <+mrhandsss> guessing then he's going to the evo devo
[4:32:00] <derap41> What you don't think Ghost know about technologi
[4:32:01] <%solzan2000> they wanna rest in peace I get
[4:32:08] <@Solidus_113> here's the zone
[4:32:09] <%solzan2000> guess*
[4:32:11] <@Solidus_113> the fuck zone
[4:32:22] <+mrhandsss> this place...
[4:32:26] <+Apokrypton> Big Boy's Fuck Zone
[4:32:26] <%ultrasparkseid> sucks
[4:32:28] <Riorii> big boi
[4:32:30] <+mrhandsss> i wonder if they'll notice IT
[4:32:34] <+mrhandsss> i honestly didnt
[4:32:36] <xSettingSunx> Welcome to the ash fields, motherfucker
[4:32:43] <+Apokrypton> is there any deal with that guy or is he just big
[4:32:50] <@Solidus_113> unknown
[4:32:52] <Riorii> at first i just thought it was close
[4:32:56] <+mrhandsss> harder to kill. spawns 2 bosses
[4:33:00] <%GeneralSCPatton> Is that the sulfur pit they go to in Dr. Stone?
[4:33:16] <Dementedpenguin> I actually think this place is fun once you know how to use the cutter.
[4:33:30] <+Apokrypton> oh yeah the cutter kinda fucks up the balance of the game honestly
[4:33:34] <@Solidus_113> you can always call out for help in fights
[4:33:57] <+Apokrypton> oh shit that's why that's good
[4:34:02] <+Apokrypton> i didn't realize it did so much
[4:34:23] <+drfaustisdead> fun fact: when you stealth kill a B.T. your breath meter refills, if you're meter's high enough you can just hold your breath through an entire zone.
[4:34:24] <+mrhandsss> didnt even notice THAT bt when i did this mission
[4:34:50] <Dementedpenguin> Cabela's BT Hunting
[4:34:50] <xSettingSunx> First managed to use the cord cutter successfully when I didn't have BB with me, fun times
[4:35:43] <Dementedpenguin> That's a sentence. LUL
[4:35:57] <@Solidus_113> babies have small hurtboxes
[4:36:38] <%artilleryZero> Only after everything was said and done did I find out it was easier to bring a shit ton of weapons and just kill the boss BT, and then just pick everything required at my leisure~
[4:36:39] <Serge_12> So my baby has a small hurtbox?
[4:36:57] <+Javaa01> Yeah, but all hits against babies are mortal counters
[4:37:01] <Djinnazz> It‚Äôs fine, You have the cord cutter
[4:37:07] <@Solidus_113> highs and mids cannot harm a baby
[4:37:15] <@Solidus_113> BIG
[4:37:18] <+Apokrypton> THE BOY THE BOY
[4:37:20] <+mrhandsss> TRY IT
[4:37:21] <Serge_12> pianodUrien

[4:38:09] <Tucker0603> @woolieversus that ain't a close one, that a big one
[4:38:11] <@Solidus_113> HE'S A BIG
[4:38:18] <+jiggy_snipe> it's a bigger BT
[4:38:22] <Djinnazz> No he‚Äôs FAR
[4:38:23] <+mrhandsss> oblivious
[4:38:26] <@Solidus_113> he was far away
[4:38:30] <+Javaa01> No, he was on the other side of the puddle
[4:38:38] <Riorii> no you cant knife him
[4:38:39] <+Javaa01> He was Chonky
[4:38:44] <%gatorafan> Long BT is loooooooooooooooong
[4:38:47] <+drfaustisdead> they drop a lot of crystals too.
[4:39:02] <%GeneralSCPatton> I LIKE 'EM BIG
[4:39:13] <@Solidus_113> there'a a baby right ahead
[4:39:18] <@Solidus_113> I saw it
[4:39:18] <+linSP> do you CBT? yeah, I Cut BT (cords)
[4:39:18] <+mrhandsss> yeah the handgun is so much better for bts than the AR its kinda sad
[4:39:44] <Mrbaconator> THE BABY
[4:39:49] <+mrhandsss> dont trigger the babbys
[4:39:55] <@Solidus_113> big 2
[4:39:55] <+linSP> headshot the baby ghost
[4:40:19] <@Solidus_113> grenades
[4:40:22] <+Javaa01> Blood nades are up next, if you want
[4:40:26] <Tucker0603> meta gear time
[4:40:39] <+drfaustisdead> time to hidden blade these ghosts.
[4:40:54] <+Apokrypton> big boy big money
[4:40:57] <+mrhandsss> and all this time the rain is wrecking his gear not in the bag
[4:41:39] <arivalappears> The container condition really doesn't matter as long as you don't fall
[4:41:56] <@Solidus_113> all these chirals thoooo
[4:42:07] <+Apokrypton> it does damage the actual cargo once the container is fucked
[4:42:43] <+mrhandsss> yeah but u cant repair things like ladders, climbing rope, or guns
[4:42:46] <arivalappears> I've never had that happen. I beat it around launch though, so maybe it was patched in
[4:42:51] <Djinnazz> Those are gonna disappear
[4:42:59] <arivalappears> True
[4:43:02] <+Apokrypton> rip chirals
[4:43:07] <+mrhandsss> u can make more, but u dont HAVE to when u run out of ammo. ammo restocks at safe rooms iirc
[4:43:14] <Tucker0603> is his mask eating up his battery still?
[4:43:20] <@Solidus_113> you still have a pack of grenades
[4:43:20] <+mrhandsss> yes

[4:44:12] <+mrhandsss> good news is right by where he needs to go for this, there's a battery charging hotspring
[4:44:39] <%solzan2000> nice looking area
[4:44:57] <@Solidus_113> Volcanoes are pretty sweet

[4:45:20] <@Solidus_113> spring on your right @WoolieVersus
[4:45:27] <Tucker0603> man, farming pvp gear is annoying in FFXIV with the wait times
[4:46:04] <+Javaa01> You don't have Claws anymore so you can't just bumble up a sheer cliff
[4:46:26] <@Solidus_113> you passed it
[4:46:30] <+Apokrypton> has he thrown anything with the gloves yet
[4:47:03] <xoyv> gloves went bye bye
[4:47:17] <+Apokrypton> 50m BT's
[4:47:29] <NotHereToStream> now this prepper is somebody you want to keep levelling up
[4:47:37] <+Javaa01> Nah, it's just the ghost of LeBron
[4:47:42] <+Apokrypton> what do they give?? i never levelled them
[4:47:45] <+mrhandsss> forget wat she gives
[4:47:59] <+linSP> oh yeah she gives the biggest guns at 5 stars
[4:48:06] <+mrhandsss> just remember she was annoying and didnt want to 5 star me

[4:48:20] <+Apokrypton> oh shit
[4:48:23] <+Apokrypton> getting those early would be wild
[4:48:43] <+mrhandsss> dont need those till they ready till endgame
[4:49:00] <+linSP> that pit is a really amazing boss arena
[4:49:05] <derap41> Woolie is so good at the game he no longer needs to play it
[4:49:10] <+linSP> also its a tough fight

[4:49:27] <+Taglog7> PogChamp
[4:49:29] <+Apokrypton> OH YEAH these things are the shit

[4:50:28] <+linSP> from this point on, i carried 3 types of heavy guns
[4:50:36] <+Apokrypton> what does it do in swordmaster tho
[4:50:47] <+vaderxyz1970> just makes a mess
[4:50:51] <+vaderxyz1970> on the floor
[4:51:15] <poohtrailsnailcooch> woolie looks like he is sleeping
[4:51:24] <+Apokrypton> sam holding an assault rifle by the barrel like the baseball bat costanza meme
[4:51:24] <@Solidus_113> back to the lab again~
[4:51:58] <+Taglog7> Kreygasm success juice

[4:52:40] <BurdRightsActivist> DOOMZ FARM
[4:53:00] <+drfaustisdead> Woolie trying to turn the Death Stranding into Minecraft.
[4:53:12] <@Solidus_113> gourds
[4:53:14] <+drfaustisdead> Just get some Dooms people to make a B.T. Grinder.
[4:53:55] <+mrhandsss> they really need to do that pizza delivery soon because there's another one they should do before they progress further in the story
[4:54:40] <Graxe_> We back to nukes
[4:54:59] <derap41> You gonna print enriched uranium ?
[4:55:09] <+mrhandsss> speaking of the elder, when did they last deliver to him
[4:55:30] <+jiggy_snipe> MAD
[4:55:32] <%artilleryZero> ohh shit yeah
[4:56:07] <xoyv> 3d printed guns aren't that durable, and i don't think a 3d printer would be able to handle something as complicated as a nuke
[4:56:23] <+Taglog7> Bruv
[4:56:31] <AThing_> Yeah aren't 3d printed guns about as effective as pipeguns?
[4:57:29] <arkv01> weaponized boomer shits
[4:57:45] <+MrRabbles> sovereign citizen
[4:58:00] <derap41> fucking dumb
[4:58:14] <%artilleryZero> sovereign citizen energy lol
[4:58:31] <%GeneralSCPatton> Where does the refined Uranium even come from?
[4:58:37] <derap41> Good luck with that
[4:58:48] <AThing_> Yeah that's what I was thinking too, doesn't that require some friggin' alchemy?
[4:58:50] <derap41> Just going to fuse some heavy elements for fun
[4:58:59] <+drfaustisdead> make a nuke ghost
[4:58:59] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:59:06] <+linSP> i think the chiral network uses time travel to print shit
[4:59:18] <NotHereToStream> just use a dead body Kappa
[4:59:47] <+Piemen99> Tumblr con
[4:59:47] <derap41> ....Sam caused the furry apocalypse
[4:59:51] <+jiggy_snipe> YEA BOI
[4:59:53] <Graxe_> Hydrogen is much more readily available than enriched uranium
[5:00:06] <+drfaustisdead> multiverse
[5:00:35] <tiaramaki> Everyone is Sam mod when? Kappa
[5:00:35] <xSettingSunx> I'm Sam Bridges, and you are too.
[5:00:37] <+drfaustisdead> I mean Sam is a constant in all realities because he can't die.
[5:00:38] <@Solidus_113> Famits2
[5:00:40] <xSettingSunx> No... he's both of us, together.
[5:00:55] <GarrisonWaifu> Simon Courier Tether, the diet version
[5:01:11] <+snarfton23> etalWoah
[5:01:41] <derap41> Have a Sam Twitch stream
[5:01:45] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus does yatagarasu just not have joystick control or support for controllers?
[5:01:48] <+linSP> yooo, what if another reason sam hates touching others is because if he touches another prepper that's actually him, he creates a time paradox
[5:02:00] <NotHereToStream> ky jelly PogChamp
[5:02:05] <+mrhandsss> super tight
[5:02:06] <GarrisonWaifu> Working under time cop rules
[5:02:09] <%CaptainPileDriver> like...i can only use the pad and that makes using the 1 throw character fucking terrible
[5:02:10] <Graxe_> super tight and durable
[5:02:13] <Graxe_> hm
[5:02:50] <%bread_assassin> Awwww
[5:03:05] <arkv01> name him sam after the great samuel L jackson
[5:03:10] <+drfaustisdead> Man it's like he's Uncle Sam or something.
[5:03:16] <+drfaustisdead> hint hint hint
[5:03:57] <derap41> Woolie gets it
[5:04:19] <Graxe_> They all have a similar voice and tone
[5:04:25] <Tucker0603> @woolieversus *cough cough* Kojima
[5:04:49] <+linSP> the emails are definitely one guy
[5:05:15] <arkv01> I mean its probably one or two guys max translating these
[5:05:19] <+drfaustisdead> All of these people are all isolated weirdos, I mean they litter their emails with emoji's even that 5000 year woman.
[5:05:22] <lotharrio> Wait for the big reveal, that in-game, there's just one person writing all of these.
[5:05:28] <arkv01> and probably all written by one dude on the jp side
[5:05:40] <lotharrio> They off-load all the email work to someone else, and he gets likes for doing their email writing.
[5:06:00] <xSettingSunx> Tbh the only email writing style that really stands out to me is the Elder
[5:06:01] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[5:06:27] <%CaptainPileDriver> man, i may just return yatagarasu cause fuck, it looks nice but if i can't use the joystick there's no way.
[5:06:35] <+linSP> its like if the same guy was placed into every prepper's situation
[5:06:47] <+drfaustisdead> wait?! she's married to the Doctor? I thought she was his assistant.
[5:06:58] <+mrhandsss> oh right this character that never speaks and just stares at you
[5:07:38] <arkv01> gonna get that well agd D
[5:07:42] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[5:07:46] <+drfaustisdead> TBF I'm in an inter-generational relationship myself so I don't know why I'm so shocked.
[5:08:14] <arkv01> @drfaustisdead twice your age?
[5:08:49] <Tucker0603> ah shit, this crazy bitch
[5:08:51] <+drfaustisdead> @arkv01 20 years.
[5:09:23] <+linSP> everyone is twice someone's age at some point, unless theyre younger
[5:09:24] <%GeneralSCPatton> MAGIC ITEM
[5:09:28] <TheLordOfTheScrubs> Ancient Nanomachines
[5:09:32] <+Javaa01> I guess enough people died, and they figured it out
[5:09:37] <+MrRabbles> because the body weighs less when people die
[5:09:38] <+Javaa01> Or ancient Nanomachines, yeah
[5:09:41] <arkv01> pasture's always... odder on the other side
[5:09:52] <samuelfisk> What did Egyptians know about antimatter?
[5:09:59] <arkv01> duh, stargate
[5:10:02] <OldManDeckardCain> NANOMACHINES
[5:10:07] <Pappajimbo> magic cards
[5:10:12] <arkv01> the goa'uld did some shit
[5:10:26] <Belutima> tpYGOddduel tpYGOpuzzle
[5:10:31] <+drfaustisdead> I mean they're using the ghost dimension for faster internet and computing so yeah it's magic.
[5:10:40] <+MrRabbles> remember the everlasting light bulb
[5:10:41] <%artilleryZero> I imagine they were conquered and their knowledge died with them?
[5:11:06] <derap41> They figured out how to make right angles it must that been that technology
[5:11:23] <+DRAGKUDO> HahaThink
[5:11:40] <arkv01> mmm I love getting buttered up
[5:11:47] <+jiggy_snipe> use your mind Woolie
[5:11:48] <MayorRev> mmmmm nuggies
[5:11:48] <+MrWummzy> mmmmmmmmmmmmm
[5:12:00] <+MrWummzy> ur a cute lil nugget
[5:12:05] <+MrWummzy> WAIT
[5:12:08] <+MrWummzy> PAUSE
[5:12:09] <+linSP> if the Egyptians were so smart, how come they were taken over by the romans? checked maid
[5:12:34] <+MrRabbles> if the ancients were so smart how come they're dead
[5:12:42] <+Javaa01> Oh hey, Kojimbo's going on about the Cold War again
[5:13:04] <Tucker0603> eh?
[5:13:05] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1222044563210145793?s=19
[5:13:07] <+MrWummzy> looks lil saudi pat
[5:13:16] <+MrWummzy> like*
[5:13:17] <derap41> eh phrasing
[5:13:22] <xSettingSunx> To me it never felt like Kojima was outright saying the Egyptians predicted the Death Stranding, more like their mythos was the most applicable to the concepts Death Stranding researchers were discovering. Besides the Spiritualist's rambling, the only real Egyptian concepts used by researchers are "Ha" and "Ka"
[5:13:34] <@Solidus_113> "I found photos of my dad in a fursuit"
[5:13:48] <+MrWummzy> did u fap
[5:14:37] <AThing_> no i yiffed
[5:14:38] <derap41> This guy is smoking crack
[5:14:39] <AxelCezar> this game sure has a lot of text with nonsense
[5:14:52] <@Solidus_113> yes
[5:15:01] <+MrWummzy> yall cowards dont even smoke crack
[5:15:23] <+jiggy_snipe> Murderer Woolie
[5:15:41] <QaizerArt> SO LONGA SPIRITUALIST
[5:15:43] <+MrWummzy> Its arab pat again
[5:15:50] <+linSP> she sounds like colonel in mgs2 when he was describing the orb he saw when he was driving home
[5:16:00] <AThing_> oh god he does sorta look like pat
[5:16:01] <@Solidus_113> what you'd do is kill someone, carry their corpse to her doorstep, and then wait for the voidout
[5:16:05] <derap41> fucking Y2K
[5:16:23] <+drfaustisdead> So does this email mean that the death stranding happened a year after 9-11?
[5:16:26] <derap41> Kojima you are way above in over your head right no
[5:16:28] <derap41> w
[5:17:21] <arkv01> kojima loves pointy shit
[5:17:24] <+jiggy_snipe> yes he did cuz he's a genius
[5:17:47] <arkv01> he has to prod you with his pointy things until you cry out in pleasure
[5:18:08] <+mrhandsss> they'd be the crazy weirdos living in bunkers today
[5:18:22] <+drfaustisdead> that's the Cuban missile crisis, I think.
[5:18:37] <+linSP> the atomic age was during wwII
[5:18:45] <xSettingSunx> Timefall Porter cans have an expiration of 2050, so the game's gotta take place close to that year
[5:19:04] <xSettingSunx> Voidouts probably began right about now
[5:19:14] <derap41> Keep on Keeping on
[5:19:34] <+ChiefWilly> Intern! We need fake emails. Get on it!
[5:19:45] <otecanime> ni–±–±a

[5:21:56] <QaizerArt> please don't avoid the filter.
[5:21:57] <%GeneralSCPatton> @arkv01 Naked Snake never invented them in this timeline
[5:22:12] <Solidnick18> hmmm
[5:22:15] <samuelfisk> Overtext
[5:22:30] <+MrRabbles> yes its a game we get it
[5:22:33] <derap41> This is beyond overtext
[5:22:43] <+mrhandsss> Jake from Wind Farm
[5:22:43] <+Piemen99> god i hate himm
[5:22:55] <derap41> This is punching you in the balls screaming
[5:22:55] <Solidnick18> NotLikeThis
[5:22:57] <Prevot> don't look Homo Blanka in the eyes, dont shake their hands
[5:23:09] <+linSP> kojima is explaining the name of his mascot through dorito pope
[5:23:47] <+ChiefWilly> I wonder if the japanese text is more subtle and hes just looking down on the West
[5:23:51] <%GeneralSCPatton> √òM√ëƒÆ≈§√äX≈¢
[5:24:02] <Solidnick18> make it whole again guys
[5:24:05] <%valriot> So this is a Death Note prequel?
[5:24:08] <+MrRabbles> is this the descendant of John Hancock
[5:24:16] <samuelfisk> ChiefWilly that would be fascinating to know.
[5:24:25] <%razielhex> they literally broke the mould when they made Sam
[5:24:55] <samuelfisk> I hate the term Reconstruction
[5:25:06] <samuelfisk> Reconstructionsm
[5:25:09] <Solidnick18> no lag PogChamp
[5:25:32] <%valriot> I feel like you can replace every "chiral network" with "Monster Energy", and nothing changes
[5:25:46] <TheZearGuy> I‚Äôd welcome the Death Stranding if it means no lag
[5:26:12] <xSettingSunx> Chiral livestreams
[5:26:14] <+MrRabbles> Keep Ziggy away from those shipping containers
[5:26:18] <+Jonrskittles> is there any base building in this game?
[5:27:07] <+MrRabbles> i don't believe there is just structure building
[5:27:07] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[5:27:08] <+mrhandsss> u can build a safe room, but thats pretty standard.
[5:27:23] <+MrRabbles> oh no
[5:27:37] <Solidnick18> boo
[5:27:40] <%CaptainPileDriver> man
[5:27:58] <%CaptainPileDriver> fucking yatagarasu not having joystick support for controllers is fucking stupid
[5:28:01] <xSettingSunx> Wouldn't have recording hiccups if you joined the chiral network
[5:28:02] <Tucker0603> what I miss? stream over?
[5:28:24] <@Solidus_113> winding down
[5:28:43] <%CaptainPileDriver> i play grapplers, and i gotta do a 720 on a pad, that's some bullshit
[5:28:52] <+mrhandsss> i really hope they dont forget the pizza deliveries next time
[5:29:15] <TheZearGuy> I could really go for a pizza right now
[5:29:28] <arkv01> pizza it is
[5:29:40] <%razielhex> Cowabunga it is
[5:29:50] <+mrhandsss> by now, the 4th delivery outta be available, but first they need to go back to the timefall farm for the 3rd delivery
[5:30:18] <+mrhandsss> maybe off camera? im sure they'll go investigate the veteran porter now that they know he's out there
[5:30:21] <+ChiefWilly> Bruh art... is deep
[5:30:29] <OldManDeckardCain> those emails are just twitter now LUL
[5:30:33] <juxtest> If we stop making music our legs will fall off

[5:30:55] <+MrRabbles> traaaaaaaditioooooooooooon! tradition!
[5:30:59] <+jiggy_snipe> yea what if you're Pat
[5:31:10] <+DRAGKUDO> it's fun
[5:31:11] <+ChiefWilly> If music happens but no one is around to hear it. Is it still music?
[5:31:21] <+Freelance7> What if you're pat and have 0 creativity
[5:31:35] <+jiggy_snipe> I mean if no one is around, did it even happen?
[5:31:53] <TheZearGuy> God hates music I bet. Just in general.
[5:31:58] <+Taglog7> Just praise the Lord, aite
[5:32:05] <+ChiefWilly> Is a suffocated cat in a box dead if you can't see it? Jury is out
[5:32:23] <%GeneralSCPatton> God gets really bored, and the only radio station he gets is the people currently singing about him
[5:32:32] <TheLordOfTheScrubs> Schrodinger's Symphony
[5:32:33] <+ChiefWilly> Unless..... the cat observed its own death.

[5:33:30] <%GeneralSCPatton> @chiefwilly Quantum immortality bro
[5:33:31] <TheLordOfTheScrubs> Gotta get that world record run on finding jeasus
[5:33:54] <aggrotadpole> @woolieversus are you 100%ing this (whatever that would mean)
[5:34:22] <xSettingSunx> I hear you can bug out the game before starting and take the purgatory route early
