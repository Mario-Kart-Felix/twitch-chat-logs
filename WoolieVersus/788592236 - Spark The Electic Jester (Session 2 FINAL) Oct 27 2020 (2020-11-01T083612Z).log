[0:01:35] <dodgy_dingo_> 'prostizatripper' is the name they changed plague's account to
[0:01:36] <dodgy_dingo_> yes
[0:01:40] <%Exiliator> Wow just checked my follows and found a random name I've never seen before yeah...
[0:01:48] <%emperordread> Listen to @brickwall35 guys
[0:01:52] <$arcielardor> WHO WOULD DO SUCH A LOUSY THING!!
[0:02:02] <BalloniWright> Prostizatripper sounds like a Style for Dante LUL
[0:02:21] <%KoopaPrez> His Twitter is down it looks like
[0:02:23] <%Aeoneth> Already done as soon as I heard. Hoping PLague gets his account back
[0:02:23] <SoromopsEX> LMAO it does sound like that
[0:02:23] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1320951939224555520?s=20
[0:02:23] <%krispen_wa> Sounds vaguely slavic

[0:03:03] <SoromopsEX> lytLEERY ????
[0:03:03] <%Aeoneth> An different but also depressing news. Cyberpunk got delayed to Dec 10th
[0:03:26] <+Superbro64> I remember this story from the friendcast LUL
[0:03:41] <%emperordread> reselling digital goods is a good way to money launder, that's where most of the fraud / theft ends up
[0:03:42] <%Regigangster> Woolie already speak on cyberpunk delay?
[0:03:50] <ShiningAxis> cyberpunk getting delayed again is not at all a surprise
[0:04:10] <+Superbro64> @regigangster they are more important things happening now
[0:04:14] <NotHereToStream> always two factor, save yourself from potential trouble
[0:04:18] <+Superbro64> Plague in trouble
[0:04:20] <%Regigangster> @Superbro64 ok well I just got here
[0:04:21] <$JobbedBone> you have to weigh the risk of "will someone steal this phone" though
[0:04:27] <gade177> What r we talking about?
[0:04:27] <%doombawkzvs> Woah jeez
[0:04:29] <+jiggy_snipe> yes use 2FA everywhere
[0:04:33] <+CelebrityGhost> change your passwords regularly, too
[0:04:40] <kenny_biff> thats fucked. poor plague
[0:04:41] <$JobbedBone> then you lose access to everything
[0:04:43] <+ggbhtg> Actually targeted, damn it...
[0:04:43] <+Superbro64> Chat: plague had his twitch hacked, and his paypal fucked with
[0:04:43] <%Terrarp> Jeez what an asshole
[0:04:49] <+Superbro64> to anyone who just came in
[0:04:54] <gade177> @Superbro64 Damn y?
[0:04:56] <dodgy_dingo_> Some Russian schizoid
[0:05:01] <%Exiliator> I cant even think of why really?
[0:05:03] <%doombawkzvs> Wait Woolie got robbed too?
[0:05:08] <dreadedcthulhu> password managers are high tier tech
[0:05:10] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Do you know if Plague didn't have 2 factor?
[0:05:14] <Reveresao> Did my part!
[0:05:15] <%emperordread> @JobbedBone Not true, you can get your phone provider to block or transfer your number to a new device
[0:05:17] <%Asuterisuku> Woolie mentioned it happening a while ago.
[0:05:18] <%doombawkzvs> OH okay
[0:05:21] <%doombawkzvs> Whew
[0:05:25] <+Feralspirit41> Someone from China revently got into my spotify luckily I was able to secure it before anything major happenef
[0:05:26] <+ggbhtg> It's annoying to have 15 passwords to rotate....but you gotta
[0:05:34] <+ggbhtg> no common words
[0:05:36] <+JustToWatch> also check haveibeenpwned regularly
[0:05:41] <ScreamLord> @WoolieVersus Is Plague alright?
[0:05:45] <Zebroneath> I hope this gets sorted ASAP
[0:05:46] <+ggbhtg> also symbols and numbers
[0:05:51] <andrewofbob> Paper is hard to hack; good place for passwords
[0:05:52] <+ggbhtg> always
[0:06:02] <Speckster42> the most important thing is to secure the accounts that really matter to you
[0:06:22] <$JobbedBone> @emperordread depends on the 2fa scheme, if they don't support it over text and want you to use an app the token is gone and you're fucked. very common in corporate environments
[0:06:23] <%doombawkzvs> I always make my passwords inputs to very complicated combos in anime fighter notation
[0:06:27] <dreadedcthulhu> there will always be a cat and mouse game between infosef
[0:06:36] <dreadedcthulhu> infosec* and hqckers
[0:06:44] <%Seancicle> 🔐🔝💯
[0:06:44] <+karldeck> Hi Woolie, you probably have already been told by now, but just because a company don't mention localization of a game every quarterly report doesn't it won't happen, also you know the hell Atlus USA went through with Aegis and it's going to be hard to work on P5S when that was worked on during Flue
[0:06:47] <+ggbhtg> sadly, security is more of a gentlemen's agreement..

[0:13:05] <+ja07sj> 3080!
[0:13:11] <%Asuterisuku> 64GB RAM whew
[0:13:12] <SilverFaustX> dont buy intel
[0:13:18] <+ggbhtg> CHAT hatin on RGB BRAND SYNERGY huh
[0:13:21] <+ja07sj> intel is fine for gaming
[0:13:22] <LedInf> the flashy stuff is supposed to be on the screen, not the pc it self LUL
[0:13:24] <SilverFaustX> no
[0:13:24] <%brickwall35> oof that's hefty
[0:13:24] <+SassyBassy_> Why intel?
[0:13:45] <@Solidus_113> All PCs deserve to look like space ships
[0:13:47] <SlangPunk> This sounds real expensive
[0:13:50] <%Livelinne> woolieGLORY
[0:13:53] <%brickwall35> wonder what the price tag on that is
[0:13:56] <SilverFaustX> its shit
[0:13:56] <+ggbhtg> Why NOT AMD?
[0:13:57] <ronintheshadow900> Is Ryzen better for gaming
[0:13:58] <YakumoYomi> I guess you'll need that 10TB, considering you do a lot of video encoding
[0:14:00] <%cobalt_phoenix_> are they gonna stream when thwy build that?
[0:14:01] <%Asuterisuku> @SassyBassy_ Not having to go through driver hell is a factor.
[0:14:05] <+jiggy_snipe> AMD is probably surpassing Intel now
[0:14:15] <%Seancicle> afk, brb
[0:14:16] <+b_aleph> Where is Reggienald?
[0:14:16] <RealPT1> so whens Uppers?
[0:14:25] <+Exicuren> Most likely is for gaming and streaming, Intel is fine
[0:14:26] <TylerRich117> 21 day delay on Cyberpunk FeelsBadMan
[0:14:29] <Joeggernaut777> Make sure to get SSD. Let HDD die.
[0:14:33] <+ggbhtg> Why 'not' Nvidia / AMD then?
[0:14:36] <Ragnorok64> a 10900 will be more than fine
[0:14:38] <LedInf> I wonder if the new ryzens are better for stuff like cemu, and rpcs3?
[0:14:38] <+ggbhtg> Eh whatever
[0:14:40] <arkv01> it'll crush... some puss
[0:14:42] <Solidnick18> yeah

[0:15:03] <shiny_prinny> that poor guy who asked about taking off work
[0:15:03] <@Menitta> Yesterday they said "NO MORE WE PROMISE"
[0:15:04] <@Solidus_113> HDDs are fine for older games, as long as the disk RPM is 7500+
[0:15:04] <+johnny_gogo> yesterday they said to a fan it was going to be the 18th for sure
[0:15:10] <+ja07sj> oh it's definitely 21 more days of crunch
[0:15:12] <$Kekon3> bets that its gonna happen to NMH3 too?
[0:15:12] <+CelebrityGhost> i honestly thought it was delayed to 2021 already
[0:15:13] <SlangPunk> I figure 2077 is the release date now

[0:17:08] <%doomerskeletor13> My excitement for this game went from “most anticipated game ever” to “I’ll wait till it’s on sale”
[0:17:17] <Gallhint> they could have just swept that under the rug and released a shit game. it's hard to choose between angering or disappointing people excited for your product.
[0:17:23] <+ggbhtg> DMCA?.....
[0:17:32] <+ggbhtg> yep....
[0:17:33] <wicketpelican> Just bought and played an hour of Ghostunner and I don't think I need Cyberpunk for a whiiiile
[0:17:35] <%Livelinne> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[0:17:39] <%SivSarcast> Understandable, Woolie.
[0:17:43] <@Solidus_113> fuck music companies
[0:17:49] <Joeggernaut777> They really need to stop giving these unfinished games deadlines for release. There's literally no benefit to announcing a date then pushing it back to god knows how long
[0:17:50] <%afronooch> dmca2
[0:17:51] <%cobalt_phoenix_> woolieDATTEBAYO
[0:17:51] <Solidnick18> don't want the channel gone
[0:17:51] <%doomerskeletor13> Yeah that’s happening to a lot of folks
[0:17:54] <YakumoYomi> DMCApocalyse has jumped from Youtube to Twitch.
[0:18:15] <+ggbhtg> purge it all, even Max has done some purging, and he has a contract to have all VODs up back to 2017
[0:18:21] <wicketpelican> @Joeggernaut777 there's benefits, marketing strategy goes with the date and stuff, there's a BUNCH done and benefits for having a launch date.
[0:18:25] <+ja07sj> This DMCA thing is some hot bullshit, it's amazing how bad they're handling this.
[0:18:27] <Solidnick18> and twitch won't tell anybody anything
[0:18:28] <%Asuterisuku> That situation is so much bullshit.
[0:18:38] <%Livelinne> that sounds illegal
[0:18:43] <SomersaultJustice> wolly only? ohhh noooooooooooo
[0:18:46] <+Superbro64> thanks Amazon :)
[0:18:46] <+ggbhtg> Can't wait for all the FALSE POSITIVES!
[0:18:51] <%Aztec50> good bye rocksmith streams :(
[0:18:52] <+Feralspirit41> The industry needs to get its shit together
[0:18:57] <%Exiliator> Thats woolieTRASH
[0:18:57] <%SivSarcast> It's why I upload my stuff to Bitchute. They don't care much for copyright stuff.
[0:18:59] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @SilverFaustX
[0:19:01] <Gallhint> giving everyone the ability to make clips willy nilly in hindsight was maybe a not good idea
[0:19:02] <+Superbro64> glad that money is going into supporting your creators :)
[0:19:03] <Solidnick18> it sucks man
[0:19:04] <SilverFaustX> oops
[0:19:09] <Joeggernaut777> @wicketpelican Sure but that doesn't make it any less annoying :/
[0:19:24] <%FuqBoiSlim> literally just "figure it out 4Head". the absolute state of it
[0:19:25] <SilverFaustX> arcsys trolling cdpr
[0:19:44] <%jinking79> 416332 clips deleted man
[0:19:45] <wicketpelican> @Joeggernaut777 it's frustrating, but there's always reasons why something is done. In this case having a date is really important, but Pandemic and all it's a miracle the game is still coming out this year.
[0:19:53] <LoveYouDead> It's weird they have a way to know if a clip is causing a problem but somehow they can't tell the streamers
[0:19:54] <+Feralspirit41> The music industry also needs to be seriously reigned in
[0:19:55] <Solidnick18> i was gonna watch infinite warfare pastbroadcast but it was to late. i'll support the anime tho
[0:20:06] <+ggbhtg> @WoolieVersus What's the status of cover songs, if you know? I have a friend with a huge catalog and they wanted to okay all their stuff, but......
[0:20:08] <Solidnick18> <3
[0:20:15] <%doomerskeletor13> Getting DMCA’ed over Bible Black
[0:20:18] <Gallhint> do you guys think covid killed Elden Ring and from doesnt want to admit it?
[0:20:40] <+ggbhtg> @WoolieVersus Oh also, their stuff goes up on Spotify
[0:20:42] <+b_aleph> KOF AST for new loading screens
[0:20:48] <+ggbhtg> they got to get it approved as is
[0:20:51] <%Kain5707> Vinny Vinesauces own band music is getting copyright claimed by Amazon
[0:20:59] <@akuda_bar> i have a megaran shirt that says "video game music is real music" but now is not the right time to take a stand on that hill lmao
[0:21:07] <+jiggy_snipe> technically the video game publishers could DMCA video game music too if they wanted to
[0:21:14] <%Asuterisuku> Music publishers are shit.
[0:21:19] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @gallhint bois of you to assume it didnt die before covid
[0:21:21] <+ggbhtg> does it matter if their covers are on Spotify/iTunes/ approved by Distrokid/ etc? @WoolieVersus
[0:21:22] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> The solo camera angle is fucking with me. I can't handle change
[0:21:24] <SilverFaustX> 3rd strike music ?
[0:21:30] <SilverFaustX> #irony
[0:21:32] <lord__giraffe> id make my own music for everything
[0:21:32] <%doombawkzvs> We'll never DMCA you, Woolie <3
[0:21:32] <%cobalt_phoenix_> bold*
[0:21:37] <SomersaultJustice> Amazon: "Music... with WORDS!?!?!?"
[0:21:39] <Joeggernaut777> @jiggy_snipe That'd be a disaster for everyone involved
[0:21:41] <+b_aleph> @jiggy_snipe but they're as big assholes as music producers
[0:21:42] <%Asuterisuku> Miracle of Sound ran into a bad run of other people claiming his own songs.
[0:21:48] <+ManOfReason> Dmca says no fun allowed
[0:21:52] <%Exiliator> Clips are great
[0:21:55] <%Kain5707> DMCA2
[0:21:56] <Gallhint> @cobalt_phoenix_ its still real to me dammit ;_;
[0:21:59] <%doomerskeletor13> Jeff Bezos comes to your house and breaks your legs if you use any music in your streams
[0:22:04] <+ggbhtg> Why can't DMCA just mean Devil May Cry Alliance....
[0:22:14] <+ggbhtg> Devil May Cry All-Stars
[0:22:28] <+Superbro64> Twitch should just delete the clips system if it puts ALL their creators at risk @woolieversus
[0:22:30] <+b_aleph> Devil May Cry Asshole
[0:22:36] <%SivSarcast> DMC Apocalypse sounds like a good title.
[0:22:40] <+Feralspirit41> Just pay the company for the privalege to stream their game like that guy from Stadia wants
[0:22:41] <+ggbhtg> But nope, music rights gotta be split up 5 ways from Sunday
[0:22:45] <%cobalt_phoenix_> the real problem is how warped copyright laws hace gotten
[0:22:47] <Solidnick18> yeah
[0:22:51] <+Feralspirit41> problem solved
[0:22:57] <%Asuterisuku> @SivSarcast Just imagine if Devil May Cry started using subtitles.
[0:22:58] <Joeggernaut777> It's all automated Woolie. There will almost never be any feedback
[0:23:05] <+Superbro64> this reminds me of how YT let creators worry about COPPA, instead of dealing with it themselves
[0:23:13] <%Exiliator> People making clips is one of the main reasons for vtubers explosive success
[0:23:19] <+ggbhtg> Music rights on TV, for Covers, for Radio, parody......
[0:23:24] <%doomerskeletor13> waynerF timestampers get nothing but respect
[0:23:34] <%cobalt_phoenix_> like, it's one thing to not let someone ctrl c ctrl v your work, but to throw a shit fit bc your work is in the background is so stupid
[0:23:34] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:23:36] <Gallhint> timestampers deserve love and respeck
[0:23:38] <+Exicuren> Most likely Twitch doesn't even know themselves
[0:23:41] <dreadedcthulhu> I just like having the cast up on Tuesday morning
[0:23:50] <dreadedcthulhu> for my work mornings
[0:23:50] <+ggbhtg> Gather up all the music rights pieces like Triforce Shards...
[0:23:52] <+Superbro64> shoutouts to all the ogs on youtube who list the songs on videos WHICH DONT
[0:23:57] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ty timestamp people
[0:23:57] <+Superbro64> drives me up a wall
[0:24:02] <%chosenjuan42> zoom more
[0:24:06] <YakumoYomi> @Superbro64 It's essentially the same issue: the platform holder wants to pass on all the risk to creators but still get its cut of whatever they make
[0:24:22] <+Superbro64> @yakumoyomi coporate :)
[0:24:30] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[0:24:36] <KaiserMario> OH GOD, check @ArcSystemWorksU on Twitter right now!
[0:24:36] <@Solidus_113> dub-exclusive lore
[0:24:49] <+Superbro64> that is correct @solidus_113

[0:24:52] <%jinking79> Yellow background
[0:24:56] <+ggbhtg> Was it Funi Scrubbing BEFORE Funi Scrubbing?
[0:24:58] <@Menitta> I really wish Sign's story mode wasn't nothing
[0:25:01] <%doomerskeletor13> Yellow huh
[0:25:03] <CappuccinoGuil> OH GOD, I wasn't expecting the zoomed in camera LUL
[0:25:04] <%Asuterisuku> You can't do the SIGN runs in REV, can you?
[0:25:14] <@Solidus_113> no
[0:25:19] <%doomerskeletor13> @cappuccinoguil we need even more zoom
[0:25:23] <+Superbro64> this is true
[0:25:23] <@Solidus_113> Sign is basically a different game
[0:25:25] <+Parrish_broadnax> Let them Fight!!
[0:25:25] <+b_aleph> Woolie, have you watched Borat new subsequent moviefilm?
[0:25:33] <@Menitta> Stomp on them
[0:25:34] <%Malik1002> stomp on all the dic
[0:25:42] <%doomerskeletor13> Lore fighting is basically the same as academic fighting
[0:25:53] <SoromopsEX> ARCSYS PLS LUL
[0:25:57] <@akuda_bar> "if you have a date of birth" is a strange phrase out of context
[0:26:00] <CappuccinoGuil> @doomerskeletor13 I just joined and suddenly Woolie's face is all on screen
[0:26:01] <+Superbro64> who CARES about May's age, Johnny certainly doesn't Kappa

[0:26:15] <+ggbhtg> @akuda_bar Date of Manufacture
[0:26:16] <%RyTYoung> Hey all
[0:26:16] <+Superbro64> but good stuff to you and solidus work here Woolie doodGood @woolieversus
[0:26:18] <%Asuterisuku> GG's lore is so convoluted and the games are less than accessible for the sake of catching up.
[0:26:18] <%doomerskeletor13> woolieLORE woolieLORE woolieLORE woolieLORE
[0:26:21] <Joeggernaut777> there's Kirby lore?
[0:26:23] <LoveYouDead> "what is mankind ?"
[0:26:26] <@Solidus_113> Shiver Star is real
[0:26:31] <+ManOfReason> But it’s so good tho
[0:26:34] <%Seancicle> woolieGIRLS nyannCozy
[0:26:40] <YakumoYomi> May in Strive arguably looks younger than she does in Xrd
[0:26:56] <%Asuterisuku> I wanna touch Giovanna's buttons so badly though.
[0:27:01] <+ggbhtg> Can Kirby devour the ENTIRE Backyard???
[0:27:03] <%doomerskeletor13> Just the Facts with Woolie
[0:27:05] <@Menitta> if its something people fight over it must be ambiguous enough to not matter too
[0:27:09] <%Seancicle> unga bunga
[0:27:14] <blink289> @ArcSystemWorksU
[0:27:16] <+ggbhtg> Can Kirby devour the ENTIRE Backyard??? (THEORY SOLVED!!)
[0:27:18] <+Superbro64> Vaatividya has come under fire for having some of his vids being in theory-headcannon territory. But I do agree with the "let them fight" idea
[0:27:39] <%Asuterisuku> Viewer count just jumped up. A raid?
[0:27:44] <@Solidus_113> Sol was totally sent back in time and killed his Order Sol self
[0:27:52] <Gallhint> what has vaati even been doing in this souls drought
[0:28:00] <+Parrish_broadnax> I appreciate it because I certainly didnt know anything about GG lore
[0:28:09] <%Malik1002> when the next one i know I won't get an answer but you don't know till you ask.
[0:28:11] <SilverFaustX> put in quarter IRL to play game
[0:28:15] <+Superbro64> reminder that Strive will have a dub doodGood
[0:28:20] <+ja07sj> @WoolieVersus Are you going to take a look at Ghostrunner?
[0:28:22] <%koolaid_kevster> any plans for channel points
[0:28:25] <%jinking79> get this one word/sentence right or one guy will lash out
[0:28:27] <@Menitta> Yeah Atlus does Yakuza now
[0:28:27] <%Exiliator> Please stand up and say "I love coke" in front of your nearest television device to continue streaming
[0:28:30] <Prevot> no its not
[0:28:31] <@Solidus_113> How big of a company is Atlus?
[0:28:36] <Joeggernaut777> Yakuza 7 PogChamp
[0:28:42] <Prevot> there is absolutely no official confirmation of P5S being localized
[0:28:42] <rei0> no confirmation
[0:28:42] <+jiggy_snipe> well Woolie, they never said they weren't localizing it
[0:28:43] <Solidnick18> good
[0:28:43] <+Dova573> Is still stupid that we waiting so long for scramble
[0:28:44] <+arancet> @ja07sj he is
[0:28:45] <+NYCrownlessKing> he's speculating
[0:28:46] <arkv01> yeah it's asinine they wouldn't localize scramble
[0:28:47] <+karldeck> Not big
[0:28:48] <EddieDalmunda> Is the Guilty Gear universe just Clarke's three laws but anime?
[0:28:49] <+Superbro64> [CITATION NEEDED]
[0:28:50] <blink289> @ja07sj I hope he does
[0:28:50] <%doomerskeletor13> Yakuza 7 is a pretty huge task to localize, especially with the dub
[0:28:50] <+primax104> the news of cancellation is also speculation no?
[0:28:51] <+patrickng714> why cant Atlus just do worldwide releases like everyone else
[0:28:51] <BreakTheBarrier> Atlus is plenty big considering they have all of SEGA at their disposal
[0:28:52] <+ggbhtg> O n e g u y?
[0:28:53] <@Solidus_113> there's no confirmation on either side
[0:28:53] <%SomeSageAdvice> i haven't found confirmation
[0:28:53] <+ggbhtg> aw...
[0:28:54] <%Kain5707> im atlus :)
[0:28:55] <%Regigangster> Trust me :)
[0:28:56] <+jiggy_snipe> you were speculating originally
[0:28:56] <ronintheshadow900> I never finished Spark The Electric Jester because the final boss SUCKS

[0:29:25] <+RushUnplugged> my uncle works at Atllus in the bit mines
[0:29:26] <%Regigangster> Has chat ever lied to you?
[0:29:28] <+primax104> just coz it wasnt mentioned in the shareholder meeting, doesnt mean it is cancelled :/
[0:29:28] <+Superbro64> Isnt the point of frustration that Atlus should like money, regardless of when they release things? @woolieversus
[0:29:30] <+JustToWatch> I asked Bob Atlas himself, it's legit
[0:29:31] <%doomerskeletor13> My uncle is Atlus
[0:29:32] <arkv01> source: My dad is door-kun
[0:29:39] <Prevot> the only time they ever mentioned it being localized was in the last investor report, and now they removed that from the new report
[0:29:41] <%Regigangster> My Atlus is uncle
[0:29:43] <CappuccinoGuil> @doomerskeletor13 My Atlus is uncle
[0:29:43] <Joeggernaut777> @WoolieVersus Question for you Woolie, did you like the ragdoll mechanics in Yakuza 6 or do you think they kind of hampered the game's fighting system due to collision and such?
[0:29:43] <%Exiliator> Is woolie mute for anyone else?
[0:29:45] <Solidnick18> yasuke PogChamp
[0:29:50] <+Parrish_broadnax> So has woolie playing anything of Spark before?
[0:29:57] <BreakTheBarrier> convinced ATLUS USA is just inept
[0:29:59] <SilverFaustX> no gaijins allowed
[0:30:01] <arkv01> yeah also uh I can confirm scramble REALLY GOOD
[0:30:04] <rei0> localization is by KT not atlus tho i think
[0:30:05] <+arancet> be even dumber that they ported pq2, but not p5s
[0:30:06] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @Exiliator i hear him
[0:30:07] <+ggbhtg> Good ol' Japan....
[0:30:10] <%Exiliator> nuts
[0:30:12] <+primax104> @parrish_broadnax he has played one of the spark games before, yeah
[0:30:13] <YakumoYomi> Especially considering that P5S apparently didn't do as well as they wanted in Japan
[0:30:14] <+JustToWatch> WE REFUSE
[0:30:20] <CappuccinoGuil> Just sell it in our own backyard, we don't need anyone else
[0:30:22] <%Regigangster> NotLikeThis It doesnt make any sense

[0:30:33] <+NYCrownlessKing> thats usually WHY companies put it overseas lol @YakumoYomi
[0:30:42] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Look how long it took Sega to realize that oh shit people on PC will buy our games, let's do that

[0:46:14] <+Qsmash_> woah solo content from Woolie?
[0:46:24] <fernandapsdois> this game was meant to be cheesed
[0:46:29] <LoveYouDead> This persona music
[0:46:31] <+Superbro64> that skyline tho
[0:46:38] <%0ctaeder> is this originally for the gba?
[0:46:51] <%FuqBoiSlim> nah, its a pc game
[0:46:59] <isneezerazorblades> Kinda was meant to be cheesed. Kirby powers tend to do that.
[0:47:06] <strifer413> that sunset background is great

[0:47:17] <andre11dr> This came out in 2016?
[0:47:24] <comicalmond9135> combo
[0:47:38] <BalloniWright> How far into the game is this?
[0:47:51] <$Kekon3> I think most if not all these artists are the NSR soundtrack?
[0:48:07] <isneezerazorblades> Yeah, made by a funny Brazilian dude. He made a sequel in 3D and is working on the 3rd game.
[0:48:12] <fernandapsdois> the artist is the creator of the game
[0:48:19] <%Asuterisuku> I bet if you hit the fans they'll turn around.
[0:48:19] <fernandapsdois> like for the songs
[0:48:40] <$Kekon3> The only one I ever played is Sonic After the Sequel
[0:48:43] <Vyneci> And he noticed LUL
[0:48:45] <isneezerazorblades> But he didn't make the music though. He pays musicians.
[0:48:56] <fernandapsdois> oh ok
[0:48:58] <+diabuddha> is this actual retro or new retro?
[0:49:04] <+jiggy_snipe> new retro
[0:49:05] <+Superbro64> no op power for u Kappa
[0:49:09] <fernandapsdois> idk why i thought he made the music
[0:49:10] <Naho_Saenoki> Retraux.
[0:49:10] <ronintheshadow900> Gravity is gone for good
[0:49:13] <%RyTYoung> new retro, only on pc BibleThump
[0:49:19] <+jiggy_snipe> gravity is rare too lol
[0:49:22] <+diabuddha> neat thanks
[0:49:27] <andrewofbob> But we keep Killer Bee
[0:49:31] <ronintheshadow900> You can only get gravity once
[0:49:35] <+Superbro64> @fernandapsdois same musicians as Sonic BTS / ATS
[0:50:08] <@Solidus_113> I'm glad we're beyond the era of touching enemies does damage
[0:50:23] <andrewofbob> Contact damage is game dependent these days
[0:50:28] <+Superbro64> Does touching hurt in Freedom Planet?
[0:50:33] <strifer413> i love stage progression like this
[0:50:37] <Naho_Saenoki> Contact damage should only apply to enemies it makes sense for.
[0:50:40] <strifer413> sonic 3 style
[0:50:49] <$Kekon3> @Superbro64 the NSR music also good from them
[0:50:53] <%FuqBoiSlim> I think only spiky enemies do contact damage in FP
[0:51:10] <+Superbro64> @kekon3 DJ Subatomic Supernova Kreygasm
[0:51:14] <$Kekon3> Def Funk Fiction's tracks in that are the most funk fiction shit ive ever heard YUUUUP
[0:51:24] <%Aztec50> is this kirby meets sonic?
[0:51:28] <andrewofbob> And then FP’s metal shield nullifies spiky damage
[0:51:30] <@Solidus_113> and megaman
[0:51:45] <+Superbro64> kirby meets sonic meets mmx meets gunstar heroes
[0:51:45] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:51:49] <%Asuterisuku> Kamehameha
[0:51:56] <+Superbro64> Fepers mentions a bunch of inspirations
[0:52:20] <andre11dr> Contact damage always made more sense in shmups ,because your flying or going fast
[0:52:38] <%Asuterisuku> No way that's not a boss fountain.
[0:52:41] <+aishman> Oh it's just woolie today?
[0:52:47] <@Solidus_113> today and tomorrow
[0:52:52] <+Superbro64> contact damage doesnt make sense game design wise in a game like sonic, where you o
[0:53:01] <+Superbro64> go so fast and the enemies may be unseeable
[0:53:04] <%Seancicle> wow
[0:53:04] <andre11dr> I never understood how the fuck a Goomba actually hurts you

[0:53:41] <+jiggy_snipe> Woolie's deadpan seems perfect lol
[0:53:45] <%FuqBoiSlim> I dont mind contact damage tbh I just play every game like they have it anyway lmao
[0:54:05] <RoboticRexkek> Hammer time!
[0:54:16] <T_Sasquatch> Oh man , does woolie know about Delaypunk 2077
[0:54:18] <%Asuterisuku> Very Mega-Man style boss.

[0:54:54] <%Asuterisuku> Yes he knows about Ghostrunner.
[0:54:55] <%Regigangster> Yeah he's movin way too slow
[0:54:56] <@Solidus_113> @RoboticRexkek yes, likely full LP
[0:54:57] <T_Sasquatch> I expected this to be a ghost runner stream tho
[0:54:59] <RoboticRexkek> cool
[0:55:05] <RoboticRexkek> sweet
[0:55:06] <biomegabear> does very little damage but good reach

[0:55:48] <RamenRiderZ> nvm
[0:55:48] <T_Sasquatch> Is spark just doing kirby shit LUL
[0:55:54] <andre11dr> I think he's pretty close to the end, so he better have a backup

[1:02:13] <@akuda_bar> look it does pause the game it just pauses it into an error message
[1:02:13] <+Jaysky> No pause for alarm
[1:02:14] <@Menitta> no pausing
[1:02:14] <%FuqBoiSlim> NO PAUSE ONLY PLAY
[1:02:16] <%Asuterisuku> The notification still technically pauses the game.

[1:03:35] <Vyneci> Oh yeah, this stage is just "every annoying sonic gimmick at once" LUL
[1:03:39] <andre11dr> @superbro64 God damit...it is
[1:03:44] <Blank9> you don't know the true horror of sonic spinball

[1:03:51] <Blank9> until you open the options menu in that game
[1:03:56] <+Superbro64> Screw all casino nights
[1:03:57] <%Asuterisuku> Hot take: Casino Nights isn't all that great.
[1:04:04] <Vyneci> Casino Night, Wacky Workbench and Sonic 1 Game Gear special stages, all at once
[1:04:05] <+Superbro64> especially sonic hero casino nights
[1:04:08] <+Superbro64> it all sucks
[1:04:13] <glass_marcus> Pinball sonic levels are the worst meme in the franchise
[1:04:21] <strifer413> casino night was the "you are gonna run out of time" zone
[1:04:26] <glass_marcus> I still have nightmares about bingo highway
[1:04:26] <andre11dr> The Sparkster of The First Sin
[1:04:26] <strifer413> carnival night too
[1:04:32] <+Superbro64> literally sonic the pinball game is a d tier sonic game
[1:04:35] <%Regigangster> We stan a casino nights
[1:04:41] <+Superbro64> delete all pinball mechanics
[1:04:55] <andre11dr> Pinball is rad
[1:05:07] <+jv5_guy> it's like sonic and dynamite nursery had a baby
[1:05:21] <+jv5_guy> headey*
[1:05:25] <%Regigangster> Yoku's island express is dope af
[1:05:29] <+jv5_guy> lol
[1:05:30] <%FuqBoiSlim> okay but bingo highway in sonic heroes is kinda based

[1:07:12] <andre11dr> I like playing just actual pinball
[1:07:18] <%Asuterisuku> Gravity is just a suggestion.
[1:07:27] <%FuqBoiSlim> speed force or whatever
[1:07:43] <+Superbro64> I like that pinball game that came with windows '95
[1:07:48] <+Superbro64> Space Cadet?
[1:08:10] <andre11dr> Iea ,I've wasted a lot of time playing that
[1:08:18] <Naho_Saenoki> Fun fact, Space Cadet was a demo for a full pinball collection on Windows.
[1:08:27] <%Asuterisuku> But does this game have anxiety inducing music for drowning?
[1:08:42] <+Superbro64> spark doesnt have lungs

[1:09:22] <Oxybe> an electric jester
[1:09:27] <@akuda_bar> that doesnt answer the question tho

[2:22:41] <%nosubstancex> nosubstancex subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months, currently on a 9 month streak! Much love from Brandon P and Maribel O

[2:22:45] <heartlesshealer> oh boy
[2:22:48] <+Donchalant402> F
[2:22:59] <glass_marcus> Imagine if this game had lives
[2:22:59] <+Superbro64> wombo combo
[2:23:13] <@Solidus_113> in the words of Hannibal Buress
[2:23:14] <@akuda_bar> the kids going "yeee" went from being hype to sounding like they're laughing at him
[2:23:17] <@Solidus_113> This Sucks Man
[2:23:22] <%gatorafan> now do it perfectly 4Head
[2:23:23] <+jiggy_snipe> glad its not that retro
[2:23:30] <$Kekon3> you're def gonna learn how to fight most of these enemies by the end of this game
[2:23:41] <$Kekon3> like it or not
[2:23:42] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1320951939224555520?s=20
[2:23:56] <%skyheys> this game's design is questionable as hell but it's really fun. you can feel the fact that it's just one dude
[2:24:02] <%RyTYoung> Just learned about Persona 5 Scramble now I'm sad
[2:24:06] <%gatorafan> Heavy daze daedra1DerpyTibs
[2:24:19] <ikantreeed> damn woolie? u all alone today??
[2:24:23] <andre11dr> And i thought we would finish this to quickly for the stream. I WAS WRONG
[2:24:37] <GarbageNirvana> Not everyone can be konjak
[2:24:40] <@akuda_bar> @ikantreeed reggie has an errand today
[2:24:42] <DedlokPM> @ikantreeed both reggie and little v unavailble today and tomorrow
[2:24:47] <biomegabear> like, all the level before this were fun and challenging in their own way but is just a anal power drill into the player
[2:24:57] <heartlesshealer> oh no worse path
[2:25:02] <@akuda_bar> tiny little nuke
[2:25:02] <ikantreeed> How dare they have a life?!
[2:25:08] <+jiggy_snipe> surprise nukes Kappa
[2:25:10] <@akuda_bar> tiny baby size nuke
[2:25:18] <+Donchalant402> im shocked
[2:25:22] <+Donchalant402> woolie didnt turn back
[2:25:26] <andrewofbob> Nukes: Y/N
[2:25:39] <+Donchalant402> Y
[2:25:40] <DedlokPM> Also, I am looking forward to Woolie playing Helltaker, but the fact that Reggie will be missing out is a woolieDATTEBAYO
[2:26:08] <%skyheys> @garbagenirvana You say that like his games are better.
[2:26:14] <+Superbro64> nothing says sonic like precision platforming with a character that goes 0 to 60
[2:26:30] <andrewofbob> Now the ship is killing it’s own soldiers
[2:26:34] <heartlesshealer> oh nooo
[2:26:34] <+MrJazzbo> awwwww
[2:26:40] <+Donchalant402> F
[2:26:47] <@Solidus_113> God help us
[2:26:53] <biomegabear> this seems like a level FOR gravity
[2:26:58] <%wibbwobbler> another one
[2:26:58] <+Superbro64> no saves?
[2:27:11] <+Donchalant402> why not just
[2:27:12] <%gatorafan> I might be wrong but I'm pretty sure not even Sonic at its worst controls like this full charge mode
[2:27:24] <+Donchalant402> dash past all the enemies, parrying your way through?
[2:27:43] <BloodiaMK2> I won't lie, the game's soundtrack is lovely
[2:27:53] <biomegabear> SAME
[2:28:18] <%gatorafan> it's pretty cool.
[2:28:30] <andre11dr> Lame it out
[2:28:48] <andre11dr> Like its Cross Tekken
[2:29:02] <+Superbro64> let's be fair here, I have yet to play a game that controls as bad as Sonic and the Secret Rings
[2:29:06] <powerprotoman> you could just not use the super jump and avoid getting hit that way
[2:29:07] <ikantreeed> nier type beat
[2:29:07] <%skyheys> Two options: turtle mode or wing it going fast

[2:32:26] <DedlokPM> SAVE teenYEY
[2:32:26] <biomegabear> Thank fucking lord
[2:32:38] <%skyheys> PHOTONS
[2:32:45] <rosabellamelantha> Spark 1 is SO ROUGH in spots
[2:32:46] <+Donchalant402> "just win"
[2:32:59] <+Donchalant402> d
[2:32:59] <%skyheys> :^)
[2:33:09] <DedlokPM> :3
[2:33:24] <rosabellamelantha> I really do like the game but the quality drops sharply near the end
[2:33:30] <%Asuterisuku> Time to destroy the BFG
[2:33:47] <%Asuterisuku> BFG-10000 is firing
[2:33:50] <+Donchalant402> I personally like the final level
[2:34:02] <biomegabear> I wonder if different weapons would make this easier
[2:34:03] <ikantreeed> the laser should kill the enemies, it's bullshit!!!!
[2:34:08] <+Donchalant402> I feel like you're more intended to parry past all the enemies
[2:34:13] <+Donchalant402> like obstacles
[2:34:30] <%skyheys> Yeah, but Woolie's a turtle InuyoFace
[2:34:46] <biomegabear> LEVEL PLEASE END
[2:34:57] <RoboticRexkek> it really doesn't end
[2:35:08] <andrewofbob> That wasn’t even the self destruct starter
[2:35:33] <DedlokPM> But imagine all that content! doodDerp
[2:35:41] <%cobalt_phoenix_> boy this one is a long one eh
[2:35:54] <+asgard147> This was one of the complaints I heard about this game, it's alittle too long
[2:35:56] <RoboticRexkek> I'm exhausted and I'm just watching.
[2:36:19] <rosabellamelantha> This game has like the opposite of the 3d sonic problem where 3d sonic ends too fast, this has too much
[2:36:27] <DedlokPM> THE ENEMIES DON'T DIE TO THE GIANT DEATH LASER? rooREE
[2:36:37] <%gatorafan> and people complained about Titanic Monarch in Mania Kappa
[2:36:44] <rosabellamelantha> I much prefer freedom planet to spart 1
[2:36:47] <rosabellamelantha> spark 2 tho
[2:36:50] <andrewofbob> Freedom Planet split it’s spaceship finale into 4 levels and a separate final boss
[2:36:53] <rosabellamelantha> spark 2 is fucking amazing
[2:37:21] <SlangPunk> @gatorafan I never got those complaints, Titanic Monarch is easily one of the best 2D sonic stages ever IMO
[2:37:22] <BloodiaMK2> So... I take it this stage in particular is huge
[2:37:43] <+TopTieramisu> SourPls
[2:37:44] <+Qsmash_> ?
[2:37:44] <andrewofbob> 22 minutes is kinda long
[2:37:46] <RoboticRexkek> it's huge, hard and annoying XD
[2:37:47] <biomegabear> thankfully spark makes a better version of this level
[2:37:49] <%gatorafan> @slangpunk top5 final level for sure. The music alone is amazing
[2:37:49] <andrewofbob> And counting
[2:37:54] <segychan> is this rocket knight?
[2:37:55] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:38:02] <BloodiaMK2> surprising, but not unexpected
[2:38:05] <DedlokPM> I mean, there re some long ones before, but not this long and not this demanding
[2:38:16] <%cobalt_phoenix_> MORE
[2:38:18] <rosabellamelantha> Which reminds me, galaxy trail seem like they're almost done with Freedom Planet 2 so I'm expecting a mid 2021 release date for that
[2:38:19] <+asgard147> ...this isn't even the final level is it? It's the penultimate level isn't it?
[2:38:20] <@akuda_bar> it never ends
[2:38:23] <rosabellamelantha> get hype
[2:38:23] <DedlokPM> MOAR rooVV
[2:38:25] <+toficque> jeez
[2:38:27] <andrewofbob> There’s more ship
[2:38:27] <BloodiaMK2> oh wait...
[2:38:34] <%Irridium> the ride never ends...
[2:38:39] <BloodiaMK2> What do you mean there's more ship?
[2:38:39] <heartlesshealer> oh hey
[2:38:41] <+TopTieramisu> big sonic 3 vibes
[2:38:41] <biomegabear> WE'RE DONE?

[2:44:14] <+Superbro64> Pepperidge farm remembers
[2:44:16] <glass_marcus> no because that was sonic 2
[2:44:19] <%skyheys> Sonic 2
[2:44:22] <andrewofbob> 2 was metal

[2:44:25] <+Superbro64> well drat
[2:44:29] <dukenux> Nothing like coming back to the final boss battle, after not playing the game for weeks :)
[2:44:33] <%skyheys> no, metal is cd
[2:44:33] <GeneralHysterics> what is this, megaman zero?
[2:44:50] <DarthTaco> you did also fight the last boss of sonic 1 with no rings tho iirc

[2:56:14] <heartlesshealer> YEEEAH
[2:56:21] <RoboticRexkek> Pog
[2:56:22] <+asgard147> phew
[2:56:43] <+MrJazzbo> baite
[2:56:48] <RoboticRexkek> LUL
[2:57:53] <ScatterCatt> wtf is this?
[2:58:11] <+Donchalant402> good shit is what it is
[2:58:22] <RoboticRexkek> SourPls
[2:58:33] <glass_marcus> Lakitu
[2:58:35] <teefpal> Woolie doesnt figure it out
[2:58:45] <+Kyoshikei> LUL
[2:58:52] <+Kyoshikei> anyways, really like how this game is looking
[2:59:18] <+toficque> no lifebar again
[2:59:21] <+toficque> interesting
[2:59:25] <+TopTieramisu> hmmmmm
[2:59:26] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:59:32] <RoboticRexkek> well ok
[2:59:39] <SomersaultJustice> that boss sure was there
[2:59:41] <+toficque> that was sudden
[2:59:45] <RoboticRexkek> he was there indeed
[2:59:49] <heartlesshealer> background
[2:59:55] <+MrJazzbo> looks like the background, you're in the core of the base
[3:00:59] <andrewofbob> Has that look of Death Egg part 1
[3:01:26] <biomegabear> the apology level for last stage
[3:01:37] <RoboticRexkek> @biomegabear LUL
[3:01:40] <+asgard147> it's an apology
[3:01:50] <+TopTieramisu> so this level is the endgame to the last stage's infinity war?
[3:01:54] <RoboticRexkek> yeah the last stage was pretty bad
[3:01:58] <%Asuterisuku> The screen hasn't locked, you can just keep going.
[3:02:03] <heartlesshealer> LUL
[3:02:15] <+Superbro64> entirely possible that this level was playtested more, and made more forgiving as a result, because it is the final stage
[3:02:24] <+Superbro64> while the airship stage wasnt
[3:02:43] <+Donchalant402> nah
[3:03:01] <heartlesshealer> Command grab!
[3:03:03] <+Donchalant402> id say woolie was right on that one, the last one was the real last "challenge" this is your speed level
[3:03:04] <%Asuterisuku> Command grabs!
[3:03:18] <RoboticRexkek> the stage is not over tho monkaS
[3:03:26] <rosabellamelantha> This is a much better stage in general
[3:04:22] <andrewofbob> All we need now is a boss with a counter
[3:04:31] <+Superbro64> airship level didnt really need the other 2 airships
[3:04:43] <andre11dr> "I thought you suck, turns out your just a grappler" Woolie dissing every grappler player LUL
[3:04:44] <biomegabear> @superbro64 I agree
[3:04:54] <+TopTieramisu> anyone hear the ace attorney "cornered" theme in this track?
[3:05:13] <MartwyPies> fat
[3:05:17] <biomegabear> I do
[3:05:21] <+Donchalant402> not hearing it
[3:05:28] <+TopTieramisu> not at this point unfortunately
[3:06:06] <+Superbro64> were freedom planet levels also this long?
[3:06:07] <heartlesshealer> it's time
[3:06:10] <+TopTieramisu> interesting
[3:06:15] <+TopTieramisu> it's x2 sigma
[3:06:18] <RoboticRexkek> spooky
[3:06:18] <%wibbwobbler> yea i really don't know about 20 mins at this point imo
[3:06:20] <%FuqBoiSlim> monkaS
[3:06:22] <biomegabear> virtual boy?
[3:06:37] <+TopTieramisu> or maybe mm7 wily
[3:06:37] <andrewofbob> Final Dreadnaught was long first time
[3:06:37] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:06:38] <+arancet> shapes and beats?
[3:06:42] <@akuda_bar> this guy reminds me of the boss from Just Shapes & Beats
[3:06:46] <@akuda_bar> lmao jynx @arancet
[3:06:58] <+Superbro64> isnt the longest sonic level like unleashed eggmanland, which clocks in at 15-20?
[3:07:03] <heartlesshealer> save surrounded by health, so that's nice
[3:07:15] <Vyneci> Nope, some people take over an hour on eggmanland their first time
[3:07:26] <LoveYouDead> kinda getting hyped LUL
[3:07:26] <+Superbro64> haha wow jesus
[3:07:30] <+Donchalant402> dont some CD stages get pretty long on your first run?
[3:07:31] <andrewofbob> I saw a youtuber max the timer on Eggmanland
[3:07:32] <andre11dr> @superbro64 Iea, but Unleashed is bad
[3:07:34] <%FuqBoiSlim> I remember some of the Team Dark stages being pretty long too and that one Team Chaotix stage
[3:07:36] <Vyneci> It's about 15-20 if you already played the level a few times before and know what's coming up
[3:07:36] <%Asuterisuku> There's a life bar this time.
[3:07:51] <biomegabear> @andrewofbob yeah, but when they throw tons of enemies they want you to run & keep moving
[3:07:55] <+Superbro64> @andre11dr unleashed came after 06, mind you
[3:08:00] <glass_marcus> Eggmanland is long because it both a sonic and a werehog stage
[3:08:12] <+TopTieramisu> definitely getting wily vibes
[3:08:35] <andre11dr> @superbro64 Solid or wet, shit is still shit
[3:08:43] <+MisterAvry> that spike attack is burtal
[3:08:46] <@akuda_bar> this boss fight needs more Danimal Cannon
[3:09:02] <andre11dr> I actually beat 06 too
[3:09:04] <RoboticRexkek> good dmg
[3:09:08] <%Asuterisuku> 50% before he even got an attack off.
[3:09:12] <Vyneci> StinkyCheese ?
[3:09:19] <%Asuterisuku> I wonder what the speedrun strat is.
[3:09:23] <andre11dr> Because i was like "I HAVE TO KNOW"
[3:09:28] <glass_marcus> The longest sonic levels were you actually play as sonic are the 3DS version of Lost World
[3:09:34] <+Superbro64> @andre11dr whats the longest "not bad" sonic level then?
[3:09:35] <andrewofbob> Random: the worst pattern to read.
[3:09:40] <biomegabear> I perfected 06
[3:09:46] <+Superbro64> i wasn't taking game quality into account here
[3:09:47] <Vyneci> OH JESUS LOST WORLD 3DS
[3:09:58] <Vyneci> I FUCKING FORGOT
[3:10:00] <Spartanwarriormage> Lol Woolie gaming has more viewers then u right now
[3:10:01] <LoveYouDead> do u guys feel motivated ?!
[3:10:04] <+MisterAvry> noice
[3:10:04] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> this a megaman replica?
[3:10:06] <+TopTieramisu> let's go
[3:10:08] <RoboticRexkek> gg
[3:10:23] <andre11dr> I think maybe the final level in Sonic 3
[3:10:24] <+TopTieramisu> damn, the stages are so long
[3:10:37] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> or rather sonic clone
[3:10:38] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> huh
[3:10:44] <biomegabear> level continues
[3:10:47] <@akuda_bar> @TopTieramisu your name made me laugh

[3:13:19] <biomegabear> ominit needless fight

[3:14:35] <andre11dr> I think he can just dash past most enemies
[3:14:40] <+Donchalant402> you can
[3:14:47] <+Donchalant402> and there isnt any contact damage
[3:14:51] <%HarpuiaRivers> It doesn't look like the sword slash waves are hitting
[3:14:53] <%HarpuiaRivers> So janky lol
[3:15:00] <+Superbro64> health drops tho
[3:15:36] <%ChoculaUltra> nice
[3:15:40] <+Donchalant402> dont need health drops if you dont get hit from not being in fights in the first place *taps head*
[3:15:47] <+Superbro64> playing mvc2 over here, with sword being battery
[3:15:51] <%Valask> Valask subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months, currently on a 6 month streak! Woolie help Cyberpunk got delayed AGAIN I'M GOING HOLLOW
[3:16:05] <%Asuterisuku> It's just three weeks you can make it!
[3:16:13] <+Donchalant402> I ignored most enemies in sanic I ignored most here, only need to take out whats in your way
[3:16:13] <%HarpuiaRivers> Did you see the arcsys tweet about the cyberpunk delay
[3:16:21] <+Donchalant402> ooo
[3:16:23] <+Donchalant402> what they say
[3:16:28] <teefpal> Cyberpunk is actually a pretty mediocre game tbh
[3:16:33] <%Asuterisuku> Mane6 poked fun at that too.
[3:16:35] <%HarpuiaRivers> "We just feel like posting the guilty gear strive logo on a yellow back ground"
[3:16:37] <%HarpuiaRivers> :)
[3:16:53] <%Valask> oh no
[3:17:15] <andre11dr> Was that a fucking SEED reference?
[3:17:17] <%ChoculaUltra> remember when people tried to dunk on Jason Schrier for even talking about crunch at CDPR? Those same people changed their tune reaaaaaal quick after today's delay announcement LUL
[3:17:18] <andrewofbob> How does one bend light?
[3:17:20] <andre11dr> WHY

[3:17:44] <+toficque> later nerds
[3:17:46] <andre11dr> @andrewofbob mirrors actually
[3:17:54] <%ChoculaUltra> 2018 iirc?
[3:18:02] <%ChoculaUltra> so give or take 2 years and some change
[3:18:02] <%gatorafan> Manesix poking fun at delays daedra1LaughingTibs
[3:18:03] <redrins> also gravity
[3:18:22] <teefpal> They started development when?
[3:18:23] <+Superbro64> all the mmx type games are all the gunvolts inti creates releases, eh?
[3:18:34] <Vyneci> THE BAT PogChamp
[3:18:39] <biomegabear> bat
[3:18:46] <teefpal> Cause they announced like 6 years ago
[3:18:47] <+Donchalant402> isnt bat really good
[3:18:49] <%SilverDevilfish> a yard light Kappa
[3:18:49] <%FuqBoiSlim> batty
[3:18:58] <%ChoculaUltra> as for Cyberpunk, p sure the dev time has been 6-7 years at this point
[3:19:01] <Testaterone> bat is the best combat ability in the game by far
[3:19:05] <Vyneci> Bat is REALLY good
[3:19:05] <%Regigangster> Kills robins
[3:19:21] <Vyneci> Its aerial attack is probably the best in the game
[3:19:22] <+Superbro64> bat melts boss health iirc
[3:19:26] <%Valask> I really feel like Pat was right about them restarting development multiple times
[3:19:27] <Testaterone> i don't think anything comes close to the destructive power of bat
[3:19:28] <%ChoculaUltra> 99% of the time, when a game is announced, it's already been in the works for a while. Unless you're Square-Enix.
[3:19:34] <+Donchalant402> I remember the jump attack being really good
[3:19:38] <biomegabear> If Cyberpunk came out & was bad I wouldn't be surprised
[3:19:47] <+Superbro64> @choculaultra Shenmue Kappa
[3:19:57] <Vyneci> YEYEYEYEYEYE
[3:19:57] <%Asuterisuku> Everything they've shown looks pretty sweet though.
[3:19:58] <teefpal> Same
[3:19:59] <%ChoculaUltra> LUL fucking Shenmue 3 how could I forget
[3:20:04] <+Qsmash_> the pizza cutter
[3:20:10] <+casssmithart> The sound is weirdly satisfying too
[3:20:10] <+Superbro64> BGE2 Kappa
[3:20:12] <%SilverDevilfish> obligatory SPEEN
[3:20:18] <andre11dr> pizza cutter
[3:20:21] <teefpal> The game LOOKS great, but the gameplay and writing have been trash
[3:20:23] <%DappercatEsquire> time to get reckless
[3:20:32] <%ChoculaUltra> hey now, Beyond Good and Evil 2 has been confirmed to be a mass hallucination at this point
[3:20:34] <%Irridium> I mean all the witcher games came out fucked up in some way I'd be shocked if Cyberpunk didn't
[3:20:36] <+Donchalant402> the gameplay is great
[3:20:40] <+Superbro64> Metroid Prime 4, Elden Ring, Bayo 3, etc and etc
[3:20:48] <dukenux> It probably won't be bad, but it still will be filled with bugs
[3:20:48] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1320951939224555520?s=20
[3:21:01] <%Asuterisuku> Ancel isn't even working at Ubisoft anymore, BG&E2 is dead.
[3:21:03] <%ChoculaUltra> I'm not believing anything about Bayo 3 till I SEE something actually from Bayo 3.
[3:21:09] <+Donchalant402> dont judge a game purely on watching someone, this game feels really good
[3:21:11] <dukenux> What was they last update on Bayo 3 status?
[3:21:12] <+Superbro64> this years game awards would be the 3rd or 4th anniversary of the bayo 3 trailer, I think (?)
[3:21:15] <tanarath> mp4 is being made by retro now, though.
[3:21:23] <%BlackMage66652> Woolie Will Figure It Out: Game Edition
[3:21:25] <teefpal> tbh good, BG&E 2 was looking pretty bad
[3:21:27] <dukenux> *When
[3:21:30] <%HarpuiaRivers> The game does look pretty clunky but I imagine it feels different to play
[3:21:40] <%gatorafan> So much for Victory lap daedra1DerpyTibs
[3:21:43] <andrewofbob> Last I heard of Bayo 3 was the announcement trailer
[3:21:47] <+Donchalant402> at least he is finally skipping enemies
[3:21:48] <%HarpuiaRivers> I've never got super into classic sonic games tho
[3:21:53] <%HarpuiaRivers> So I don't know how to play those games lol
[3:21:57] <+Donchalant402> just run past them dude
[3:21:57] <%Irridium> Every now and then Kamiya is asked about it and says things are going great
[3:21:59] <+TopTieramisu> victory marathon
[3:21:59] <andrewofbob> Which means “we might work on this idea”
[3:22:11] <Vyneci> Bayo 3 had a million "development is going well we swear" updates and nothing else
[3:22:13] <%Asuterisuku> Bat Magic feels like it might be a good combo.
[3:22:14] <dukenux> BG&E2 either never coming out, or will be nothing like Ancel envisioned, so either way: RIP
[3:22:22] <teefpal> Imagine turning a runfast sonic game into a hack and slash
[3:22:26] <@akuda_bar> @dukenux BibleThump
[3:22:32] <%ChoculaUltra> FeelsBadMan
[3:22:36] <+Donchalant402> @teefpal its not, you dont need to stop to fight
[3:22:40] <andre11dr> Has it been like 2 years since the last time we saw Elder Ring?
[3:22:50] <+Superbro64> I just want rayman legends 3d
[3:22:55] <%Valask> Elden Ring subreddit capKEK
[3:22:58] <+Superbro64> but instead I get xcom rabbids
[3:23:03] <%Valask> fucking wild
[3:23:07] <andre11dr> It's even that much
[3:23:09] <teefpal> m bad, "treating it like a hack and slash"
[3:23:11] <biomegabear> WHAT
[3:23:12] <%SilverDevilfish> Dark Souls Grab
[3:23:14] <%ChoculaUltra> Don't talk about Elden Ring. It genuinely hurts my soul at this point. It's a soul wound if you will.
[3:23:15] <andrewofbob> Atomic Collider!
[3:23:17] <dukenux> The plan of locking up GRRM backfired, because there's no one with him to nag him about Elden Ring NotLikeThis
[3:23:23] <teefpal> XCOM rabbids was pretty good
[3:23:35] <andre11dr> FF7 REMAKE tock 76 year3
[3:23:37] <+Donchalant402> I wonder if woolz does the same in classic sanic games
[3:23:38] <+Donchalant402> wait
[3:23:41] <biomegabear> level, please don't be last level
[3:23:44] <+Donchalant402> has woolz played classic sanic?
[3:23:51] <%Regigangster> Y'all guys believe in Elden Ring? LUL
[3:24:05] <%ChoculaUltra> shut up, a man can dream dammit FeelsBadMan
[3:24:17] <%Regigangster> Also Santa Claus isn't real
[3:24:21] <%Irridium> Thankfully Bayo 3 has numbed me to lack of news pain so Eldin Ring isn't hitting me as hard.
[3:24:25] <+jiggy_snipe> Elden Ring was a collective fever dream, it never existed
[3:24:33] <biomegabear> elden ring, we should announced ce a fake news story that it's canceled
[3:24:34] <+Superbro64> @regigangster You mind if I tell you about our lord and savior GRIMM, writer for Fromsoft game Elden Ring (tm) ?
[3:24:36] <teefpal> ELDEN RING DEBUNKED
[3:25:19] <biomegabear> say elder ring is canceled to make them talk about elder ring progress
[3:25:20] <%ChoculaUltra> F
[3:25:22] <+Donchalant402> why run back
[3:25:25] <%HarpuiaRivers> bawkKek
[3:25:32] <andre11dr> Again it's only been 2 years for Elder Ring, FF15 tock like 7 or 8 years till it came out
[3:25:33] <andrewofbob> TBH, I can’t think of why Bayo 3 would have problems other then Nintendo being wierd
[3:25:48] <+Superbro64> you want to talk about wierd
[3:25:59] <andre11dr> And let's not even talk about Metroid Prime 4
[3:26:04] <%HarpuiaRivers> Are you ok man
[3:26:05] <+Donchalant402> forward momentum woolie
[3:26:07] <+Superbro64> I want to know what happened with that granblue project platinum was booted from
[3:26:14] <+Superbro64> or babylon fall
[3:26:14] <powerprotoman> running back wont get you any progress
[3:26:19] <%HarpuiaRivers> You look like you're havin trouble kizuhaRA
[3:26:25] <%Irridium> I mean Metroid Prime 4 gets a bit of a pass since Nintendo said they had to completely restart development
[3:26:30] <dukenux> [John Frakes voice] Elden Ring... is a total fabrication. It never happened.
[3:26:33] <andrewofbob> Scalebound was a disappointing abortion.
[3:26:45] <+Donchalant402> stopping to get life from big guys is getting you hit
[3:26:45] <%Irridium> I bought an Xbone for Scalebound sbfpDattebayo
[3:26:53] <+Donchalant402> stop for smaller guys maybe
[3:26:56] <%Asuterisuku> @andrewofbob Kamiya hates making sequels, so that might have something to do with it.
[3:26:56] <%ChoculaUltra> p bummed about Granblue Relink - that boss fight gameplay video from like 2019 looked rad.
[3:27:05] <%wibbwobbler> @irridium lol
[3:27:07] <dukenux> @Superbro64 now THERE'S a game i forgot existed
[3:27:08] <%Asuterisuku> @Irridium But it was coming to PC as well.
[3:27:16] <dukenux> was it Platinum's?
[3:27:18] <+Superbro64> wasnt scalebound and that dust card game remake announced in the same e3?
[3:27:20] <%BlackMage66652> This is a fucking video game
[3:27:20] <andre11dr> @irridium Sorry but LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL
[3:27:34] <+jiggy_snipe> yea Relink looked good
[3:27:40] <%Asuterisuku> At least the Phantom Dust guys rereleased the oroginal for free.
[3:27:42] <%Irridium> @Asuterisuku Its PC announcement was after I bought an xbone LUL
[3:27:42] <%Regigangster> You might
[3:27:43] <biomegabear> so did we
[3:27:46] <%ChoculaUltra> then again, Granblue Fes 2020 should still be happening this year in December. If there's no news about Relink there then its gg.

[3:28:25] <%ChoculaUltra> a new gameplay trailer would be nice, something about the game systems, actual proof something is happening - that kind of thing.

[3:33:05] <dukenux> So people who play Sonic: which is a better 2d sonic clone: this or Freedom Planet?
[3:33:08] <%Regigangster> oops all nukes
[3:33:09] <teefpal> I'm so fucking done with this level, I just want a bossfight
[3:33:22] <teefpal> Freedon Planet, no doubt
[3:33:23] <Warbot40> Freedom Planet
[3:33:28] <biomegabear> freedom planet
[3:33:39] <%wibbwobbler> chicken
[3:33:44] <teefpal> Tho you can just play Sonic ROM Hacks if you want more sonic
[3:33:47] <biomegabear> I can't think of a bad freedom planet level
[3:33:53] <+Donchalant402> I mean this games thing is that it isnt JUST sonic
[3:33:57] <+Superbro64> Jester 2 has the added bonus of being a 3d sonic adventure like, but freedom planet definitely takes it
[3:33:59] <+Donchalant402> freedom planet is more sanic
[3:34:01] <%BlackMage66652> Chat, pretend His World is playing
[3:34:01] <andrewofbob> The tank section?
[3:34:03] <+Superbro64> But I'll be honest
[3:34:17] <%Xero_J> I'd just go back to playing Sonic After the Sequel, frankly
[3:34:23] <+Superbro64> this game and freedom planet have equally cringe esque story segments
[3:34:23] <strifer413> what about spark 2 as a 3d sonic. Is it good=
[3:34:25] <strifer413> ?
[3:34:28] <+Superbro64> I could go with either
[3:34:41] <+Donchalant402> spark 2 is
[3:34:43] <+Donchalant402> REALLY short
[3:34:45] <biomegabear> @strifer413 yes imo. I like it
[3:34:51] <Warbot40> The air ship levels a bit annoying for me in Freedom Planet. Also playing as carol just isn't as fun as lilac since she relies on the bike.

[3:34:59] <fIashman92> Doesn't Magic have a full screen beam?
[3:35:01] <teefpal> So the polar opposite of 1
[3:35:05] <+Donchalant402> I beat spark 2 in 3 hours
[3:35:09] <PrideOfFiddles> First try!

[3:35:12] <%BlackMage66652> KAMEHAMEHA

[3:35:25] <%FuqBoiSlim> ah gottem ggs
[3:35:26] <+TopTieramisu> metal sonic electric boogaloo
[3:35:26] <+Superbro64> First try PogChamp
[3:35:28] <Warbot40> Spark 2 is decently fun though it's pretty ugly. That splash screen that mimics SA2 is hideous.
[3:35:34] <fIashman92> I'd rather too short than too long. Spark 1 went on forever
[3:35:41] <@Solidus_113> I swear if I see a raging demon
[3:35:45] <%Terrarp> So the final boss is a Kof character
[3:35:47] <DarthTaco> spark 2 looks pretty good for a 3d game made by one guy
[3:35:52] <andre11dr> Now this is a very Megaman boss
[3:35:59] <biomegabear> I'm glad spark 2 gives me something sonic adventure feeling stages again
[3:36:05] <dukenux> uh oh
[3:36:14] <andre11dr> Megaman X specifically
[3:36:26] <%FuqBoiSlim> yo that kick was just like the garou boss
[3:36:31] <%RyTYoung> Does anyone know why Spark 1 and 2 aren't ported to console? I need them in my liiiife
[3:36:31] <+Donchalant402> im just shocked that its really the only game to go for that sonic adventure style you know?
[3:36:38] <+Donchalant402> there is a bunch of classic sonic clones
[3:36:41] <DedlokPM> Or duck maybe rooThink
[3:36:42] <+Donchalant402> not many adventure
[3:36:52] <DarthTaco> it is hard cause the "adventure formula" is a lot messier
[3:37:01] <%BlackMage66652> Thank God there was a checkpoint between forms
[3:37:04] <biomegabear> @rytyoung spark is design in such a way it cant, 2 IA getting ported to xbox one
[3:37:07] <+Superbro64> going at those speeds in a 3d environment is a unique kind of challenge sonic team themselves struggle with
[3:37:15] <Warbot40> Harder to make a full game for the adventure style.
[3:37:24] <+Superbro64> hence the creation of the hedgehog engine being created for unleashed
[3:37:26] <andre11dr> @donchalant402 that would be because Adventure is bad
[3:37:30] <%RyTYoung> @biomegabear ahh I see
[3:37:34] <+Donchalant402> @andre11dr you're bad
[3:37:38] <LibriJamm> Shinobi 3 final boss vibes.

[3:38:02] <+Donchalant402> imagine not liking good games
[3:38:06] <DarthTaco> try it on dc maybe
[3:38:08] <%ExpressNode> Looking at this game makes me want to finish Gunvolt 2
[3:38:19] <biomegabear> @andre11dr I like interacting in the level and enemies in that gameplay, I don't need hub worlds

[3:47:49] <%FuqBoiSlim> It: Figured Out
[3:47:57] <+Donchalant402> I'd say more powers have their own tech
[3:48:01] <andre11dr> Kirby is the same tho

[3:48:18] <$arcielardor> transition over to a case bursting into flames
[3:48:23] <andre11dr> Some powers are just better
[3:48:29] <+Superbro64> Kirby: pick hammer, full power backswing, melts 90% of all enemies in 90% of all kirby games
[3:48:31] <dukenux> i can't believe the ancient one i have is still running
[3:48:32] <%Shardlab> What is Assassin's Creed but Prince of Persia with some extras glued on and the serial numbers filed off?
