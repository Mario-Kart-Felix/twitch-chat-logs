[0:47:23] <%krispen_wa> NUMBER GO UP
[0:47:24] <lotharrio> She's well suited for Gun Jedi.
[0:47:30] <GGGodtier> i think it happened when we got a the light side points
[0:47:32] <lotharrio> Str for Guardian.
[0:47:34] <+Stupid121v2> JEDI GO UP

[0:47:59] <%christopherwpoindexter> true, that is one viable way to wait
[0:48:03] <candidateplays> Yeah, Mira is the best Gun user in the game
[0:48:12] <+cdrom321> Lightsabers are still better.

[0:48:31] <+AsinPersuasion> nah sentinel/watchmen is best class
[0:48:35] <%laserbeaming> Sentinel is good for Atton because of the Sneak Attack multihits
[0:48:37] <+AsinPersuasion> sneak attack is big
[0:48:45] <DSD24> @Pookiedaexzile That's how you get the neutral ending in SMT 4 just pick the first option everytime
[0:48:46] <%christopherwpoindexter> she, like Atton, actually does have feat benefits to not blueballing levels

[1:00:28] <Safarihat> they did it
[1:00:28] <lotharrio> Oh let's make sure we do a LOT of force vision whenever we see important NPCs.
[1:00:44] <$tallik44123> dude angel were described as gaints mad out eyes taking up the sky

[1:01:41] <olaksi> That's always been a problem in every alignment-game
[1:01:42] <%christopherwpoindexter> @tallik44123 right? not these cute little winged creatures, but like, we don't see the other interpretation as often
[1:01:49] <huskarl_zap> stonks
[1:01:55] <ZeeJiggle> Yea, gameplay was you wanna max out morality, being grey doesn't have many benefits, but maybe that was the point? Probably not.

[1:02:17] <%Redblood801> ALL THE NUMBERS!
[1:02:20] <%Pookiedaexzile> +3 Inches
[1:02:20] <%Gruhunchously> PLUS 5 WISDOM
[1:02:25] <%Camail> thats +8 wisdom total from lgihtside bonuses
[1:02:26] <$tallik44123> THE STATS
[1:02:28] <Aussie_Manny> STOOPID
[1:02:29] <+AsinPersuasion> just that the jedi code doesn't lead to full good guy
[1:02:30] <lotharrio> If you drop your current armor-robe for just a robe, your defense would probably be higher.
[1:02:33] <%christopherwpoindexter> @megamirk unlimited light side power
[1:02:43] <%Camail> thats +4 to rolls
[1:02:43] <+ntfth> I think the Handmaien wisedom defense is broken for the armors, it only works on robes if the mod didn't fix it.
[1:02:45] <%Redblood801> Vsauce time
[1:02:46] <CoconutGun69> it's extra funny if you use a glitch to duplicate the crystal
[1:02:49] <+AsinPersuasion> its more about dogma
[1:02:49] <available_line> Yeah but do you need it though? You already wipe rooms with lightning.
[1:02:49] <%christopherwpoindexter> @legacy0117 tru tho
[1:02:51] <ATPsoldat> I think Kotor 2 is more like be smart about the light or dark side
[1:02:53] <dinnydanny777> Purity gives you magic power
[1:02:53] <Aussie_Manny> But Little V, if you're not with me... then you're against me.
[1:02:53] <ingman112> @gruhunchously why hk again?
[1:02:55] <+AsinPersuasion> than choosing a stance
[1:02:58] <subjectg> @camail technically +11, since ls mastery from consular and master stack
[1:02:58] <+AsinPersuasion> remember apathy is death
[1:03:08] <%gandalfsmagicgaydick> Yeah, I've always agreed. The game narratively pushes you to be gray in the context of the Jedi way vs the Sith way of doing things. But it doesn't reward you for it. Like there are responses that get you light side points for straight up defending the Jedi council.
[1:03:11] <%Gruhunchously> @ingman112 He has things to say about our new alignment

[1:03:32] <lotharrio> Oh so are we not going to get the Jedi-harem scenes?

[1:16:08] <megamirk> Carth "ran away on a beach like a bitch" Onasi
[1:16:18] <realdenimgiant> Yes generally, but the Darth bane books do an amazing job exploring the facets of the dark side and how that problem was fixed through the Rule of Two
[1:16:18] <Aussie_Manny> I don't trust this lady.

[1:20:05] <+Freeborg1997> I'm pretty sure Kreia can't go to Korriban, because it's like Bastilla in the first game. Think it's just the game subject to sequel-itis.

[1:21:21] <%christopherwpoindexter> @asinpersuasion ^
[1:21:23] <%FallenAngelZelos> Another good example of reused assets
[1:21:24] <Space_Pagan> PURE PAZAAK
[1:21:25] <DSD24> Remember when Pockets killed all those people here
[1:21:34] <hassanico2> This was the actual dungeon part of the planet wasn't it?
[1:21:34] <Space_Pagan> good times
[1:21:35] <dinnydanny777> Landed very close to those ancient pillars
[1:21:39] <peanutdot007> Pockets robbed this place so hard the ghosts are dead

[1:22:10] <%Gruhunchously> Kreia talking mad Sith Shit
[1:22:12] <DatAsuna> Tulak horde is the sickest
[1:22:12] <megamirk> KOTOR 2 could have a subtitle "More Kreia stuff"
[1:22:12] <huskarl_zap> Force hell= not korriban
[1:22:18] <%christopherwpoindexter> also let's appreciate this music and the fade out
[1:22:20] <andrei11dr> Reused assets, but is still really fucking cool
[1:22:25] <Aussie_Manny> "This sith lord was a dick. This one was okay. This sith lord owes me lunch money."
[1:22:34] <brachydios777> Hey chat, remember the sith who just lived his life and didn’t messed with anyone and died surrounded by family
[1:22:39] <KaitlynnHere> Right? Now we landed in it
[1:22:40] <dinnydanny777> When we get back I guarantee Kreia will have stolen the ship
[1:22:45] <%christopherwpoindexter> You can enjoy the music fade out more with headphones
[1:22:47] <+ntfth> The one who probably didn't actually exist?
[1:22:50] <available_line> I BET there's a sith lord that owes Kreia lunch money.
[1:22:51] <hassanico2> @brachydios777 ah yes, darth capitalist the wise, he got paid

[1:30:50] <dinnydanny777> Is Kreia scared of lizards?
[1:30:59] <lotharrio> Kreia is terrified by scalies.
[1:31:00] <penitentpentwitch> As metal as that'd be
[1:31:01] <%jillpilled> Kreia hate lizzies

[1:33:40] <+AsinPersuasion> yoda flip on us?
[1:33:46] <DSD24> I love that public domain wind sound effect
[1:33:50] <%Pookiedaexzile> "THey Just were shut up"
[1:33:53] <lotharrio> "Things are worse now! Don't question why!"
[1:33:57] <%christopherwpoindexter> That's why I do Jedi Weapon Master, with all lightsaber and two-weapon feats
[1:33:57] <dinnydanny777> I swear holocrons were an item in Jedi Knight
[1:34:02] <BlackOrchidKI> Learn those fundamentals
[1:34:12] <%haisho> dammit the holocron of sick fencing techniques is lost
[1:34:21] <%shincadad> They did DMC combos
[1:34:22] <%faytthepally> WE are children playing with toys, she knows that she doesn't measure up herself.
[1:34:22] <%Pookiedaexzile> Lebron out weighs Jordan by like 50 pounds
[1:34:24] <+Buzzkill983> They were constantly sword fighting since Sith and Jedi were in war, whereas this is more of a resurgence
[1:34:26] <DPmusique> Holocrons? No. Jedi Sacred Text Books on PAPER
[1:34:31] <%Pookiedaexzile> It would be disgusting what he did to him....
[1:34:32] <DSD24> Hord did Jedi Stingers
[1:34:33] <%haisho> I bet the holocron taught you how to do a fucking infinitew
[1:34:35] <+Buzzkill983> At least that's how I saw it
[1:34:37] <%Pookiedaexzile> but Jordan has more rings
[1:34:45] <+kapcommunist> this sith lord's father was killed due to his gambling debts to the Hut
[1:34:49] <%Gruhunchously> Remember this from the first game?
[1:34:49] <+Estuko> Summon Sabers
[1:34:53] <dinnydanny777> Also Sith confirmed better with lightsabers than Jedi I guess
[1:34:55] <DSD24> Imagine how busted a Stinger would be with a lightsaber
[1:34:56] <huskarl_zap> something about rain not touching the ground
[1:34:56] <dereks0n> I like to think that isn’t true and Kreia’s just fangirling
[1:34:57] <%Gruhunchously> Pockets literally annoyed him to death
[1:34:59] <%krispen_wa> This tomb gives you influence with Kreia ONLY if Revan was light
[1:35:03] <tolloponik> tried to kill the internet for a quick buck
[1:35:05] <%christopherwpoindexter> and also max strength, along with Weapon Master feats, so I can be like Tulak Hord....as a light sider
[1:35:21] <%Pookiedaexzile> A New bitch if you as kme
[1:35:22] <+wunp_fxs> Thats a good description

[1:35:47] <MarkUriah> Comedy Trio
[1:35:50] <Doodle_Taco> FORCE STANDS WHEN?
[1:35:52] <%haisho> force ghosts would fight each other
[1:35:57] <penitentpentwitch> You get two Sith lords screaming in your brain at the same time
[1:35:57] <+kapcommunist> ::silence::
[1:36:00] <DatAsuna> Ajunta just talks to you when you have it
[1:36:01] <tolloponik> YOSHAAAA!!!
[1:36:09] <+jiggy_snipe> PogChamp
[1:36:11] <%krispen_wa> Isn't that basically Sith Inquisitor in SWTOR?
[1:36:12] <huskarl_zap> What about swtor inquisitor?
[1:36:13] <subjectg> marka ragnos’ tomb was cooler in jedi academy
[1:36:19] <%Superspider51> That is pretty much the inquisitor plotline in swtor
[1:36:20] <lotharrio> "I am Legion."
[1:36:20] <+griffball13> Thats like the the shield that can block any weapon and the sword that can destory any armor
[1:36:21] <%RioGascar> Maybe it cancels it out?
[1:36:22] <trinityxlv> I am all... 2... of the sith...
[1:36:34] <dinnydanny777> If a planet has enough Sith relics does a planet become Sith?
[1:36:36] <$Invlux> too many cooks
[1:36:36] <andrei11dr> Is like, Mask ,and the Arrows together
[1:36:38] <%Atomik456> that clip from the simpsons where all the diseases trying to get into mr burns block each other
[1:36:38] <+jiggy_snipe> you become Legion
[1:36:44] <%memequisition> yeah this is discussed in the swtor inquisitor story
[1:36:45] <+asasqw> @WoolieVersus Sith Inquistor TOR, they all fight over control
[1:36:46] <%tealplague> I feel like they would just rip you apart mentally
[1:36:51] <%GeneralSCPatton> @atomik456 Beat me to it
[1:36:53] <%Tearonex> That's some Xioalin Showdown shit right there LUL

[1:37:33] <%rosemon5001> someone fucked the red woolie
[1:37:34] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus If you remember from that lore video, the republic genocided the race
[1:37:35] <%TitaniumDragoonNeo> Like Eleonora from TMS.
[1:37:40] <dinnydanny777> Is that beastiality?
[1:37:40] <+MidnightBurst12> half-human half-sith

[1:38:07] <%jillpilled> More than a few
[1:38:07] <+griffball13> sith would rule if they just didn't fight each other
[1:38:07] <%christopherwpoindexter> a lot of problems
[1:38:12] <%jillpilled> Yep
[1:38:18] <huskarl_zap> all Sith have cool names it's a problem.
[1:38:18] <Aussie_Manny> And a tribe.
[1:38:19] <+doc_ock_rokc> They used to be a race but are lost
[1:38:20] <GHouseduivel> @WoolieVersus Yes.
[1:38:21] <+MidnightBurst12> yes
[1:38:21] <Aussie_Manny> And a religion.
[1:38:23] <%christopherwpoindexter> "race"
[1:38:24] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus Mandalorians were never a race in legends, the race was called "taungs"
[1:38:25] <Aussie_Manny> And a faith.
[1:38:26] <subjectg> which is funny to think about how the root of all the problems with the galaxy can be traced back to the jedi
[1:38:31] <MarkUriah> Race Relgion Group
[1:38:33] <Aussie_Manny> And a fighting style.
[1:38:39] <Aussie_Manny> And a guy.
[1:38:44] <%jillpilled> And a religion, and a corrupting force, and in cases an institution and-
[1:38:49] <dinnydanny777> The Sith are cultural thieves?
[1:38:49] <%krispen_wa> that's ENDGAME dialogue
[1:38:50] <%christopherwpoindexter> *were*
[1:38:52] <subjectg> Mandalorian is a culture, sith WAS a race and now a culture
[1:38:53] <%CommanderSqueaks> Yes
[1:38:54] <+jiggy_snipe> yep
[1:38:55] <huskarl_zap> Guess what? Sith was made up by a human
[1:38:55] <therat_giant> ..
[1:38:56] <abelincoln_catpuncher> mmm.mm PC.... m. nn
[1:38:58] <GHouseduivel> Ah shit, they found us out
[1:38:59] <+AWKWARDL0SER> Like Jews & Muslims
[1:39:00] <Aussie_Manny> I...guess?
[1:39:01] <megamirk> or like Mandalorians in Classic SW
[1:39:02] <+kapcommunist> *shrugs* its a living
[1:39:12] <penitentpentwitch> But which one gets the lowercase?
[1:39:17] <TheWe4pon> are sith space Jews?
[1:39:27] <%Pookiedaexzile> Woah now
[1:39:29] <huskarl_zap> no jedi are
[1:39:29] <Greezey> ooh no no no
[1:39:29] <akman14> Sithians
[1:39:33] <%faytthepally> Oh boy
[1:39:35] <%GeneralSCPatton> Should have had a different word that starts with Sith
[1:39:35] <dereks0n> They usually describe them as like Purebloods
[1:39:35] <T_Sasquatch> @thewe4pon lmao
[1:39:38] <%christopherwpoindexter> @thewe4pon 😒😒😒
[1:39:41] <%Pookiedaexzile> Collar Tug
[1:39:42] <%Bluemanzee> What I got from this is humans and aliens can fuck
[1:39:47] <%OldManDeckardCain> WRONG RED PILL CHAT
[1:39:50] <%Gruhunchously> Absolutely
[1:39:50] <realdenimgiant> Naga Sadow & Ludo Kressh were half breeds, result of the Sith race interbreeding with fallen Jedi. The ancient Sith race lived on Korriban and were subjugated by the original dark side Jedi from the first split. They enslave the Sith race and took their name.
[1:39:51] <+SolidusRex> Jews = Sith?
[1:39:51] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:39:54] <huskarl_zap> jedi existed before sith
[1:39:56] <%christopherwpoindexter> @bluemanzee 😏
[1:39:56] <Greezey> take the sith pill
[1:40:02] <$Invlux> I guess mandalorians are followers of mandalor
[1:40:13] <dinnydanny777> Well you need to max out your midichlorians by breeding with an ancient lizard man warrior race duh
[1:40:13] <socratetris> Jedi are the same way. most of the groupa seem to be. heck the Jedi Code is just the Prayer of St. Francis
[1:40:19] <brachydios777> Mandalores are a culture not a race
[1:40:20] <huskarl_zap> Take the Pazaak pill.
[1:40:20] <megamirk> weren't mandalorians also a separate race originally
[1:40:29] <Memdosu> yeah mandos where originally the Taung
[1:40:31] <+Feralspirit41> The bame of the original mandalorians is the Taung
[1:40:31] <+thackattack00> Beware the (((sith))) Kappa
[1:40:33] <%christopherwpoindexter> @invlux for mandalore?
[1:40:40] <%masterpiecejeremy> Wait, what's the truth again? Yes
[1:40:45] <+doc_ock_rokc> @WoolieVersus Mandos were never a race they were a tribe that grew into a international culture
[1:40:47] <%DorianCreed> @WoolieVersus The race was called the Taung, though they renamed themselves Mandalorian after their elader Mandalore came about
[1:40:48] <%Pookiedaexzile> Free the palestine sector
[1:40:51] <%TitaniumDragoonNeo> Or how the current canon has further contradicted itself as each year has passed since 2014.
[1:40:52] <realdenimgiant> Sadow and Kressh fought over dominance after the death of Marka Ragnos, a Sith lord who ruled all the Sith Lords for 100 years. Then he died.
[1:40:53] <peanutdot007> Sith need to flex on each other, it is their way
[1:40:58] <dinnydanny777> Do the Sith get the boost that Human Saiyans get?
[1:41:15] <StarlitStunner> The Tong were the first Mandalorians, they created Corusscant before humans took over

[1:41:37] <%Gruhunchously> It's great until you run out of common enemies
[1:41:38] <subjectg> i recall one of these sith masters dropped an asteroid on another one
[1:41:42] <dinnydanny777> Now I am the common enemy
[1:41:42] <%DorianCreed> @StarlitStunner Less "created", more "were indigenous to"

[1:42:47] <%OldManDeckardCain> the answer is you starve because communism LUL
[1:42:49] <penitentpentwitch> It's cannibalism all the way down
[1:42:51] <dinnydanny777> That line is kind of a yikes
[1:43:04] <+kapcommunist> opps
[1:43:09] <%Gruhunchously> That's what they were doing in KOTOR 1
[1:43:10] <DSD24> Hope we find the telekinesis OOPS
[1:43:24] <%Pookiedaexzile> @OldManDeckardCain Democratically spread their welath to the people and set up high taxes for the uber rich, after setting up a social base line for living, including free shelter food and education
[1:43:24] <%Gruhunchously> Pockets rolled in and made everyone die
[1:43:49] <therat_giant> ok don't do the communism debate again please
[1:43:57] <$Invlux> 3 jedi... 4 lightsabers... 1 alligator
[1:44:03] <dinnydanny777> Sith society is basically first they came

[1:44:48] <%Gruhunchously> BUT ANAKIN DOESN'T LIKE SAND
[1:44:48] <dinnydanny777> I still find it ridiculous how many Jedi it took to beat a few droids
[1:44:49] <%Pookiedaexzile> Member how we didn't learn who any of them were
[1:44:55] <%Pookiedaexzile> and the war was kinda background
[1:44:58] <dereks0n> No matter how bad Star Wars gets, it can still always get me rehyped
[1:45:05] <%Gruhunchously> @dinnydanny777 And tehy lost, too. That's the crazy thing
[1:45:06] <megamirk> and then he slaughtered the sand people
[1:45:12] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> And then Attack of the Clones was a contender for worst Star Wars movie
[1:45:12] <%correctedsun117> @WoolieVersus Marka Ragnos was so big and important, Luke and Kyle Katarn still had to deal with his bullshit 5,000 years later in Academy
[1:45:13] <huskarl_zap> The dinosaur head was named Pedro

[1:52:42] <peanutdot007> Everyone says he needs some lotion but get the eye drops first
[1:52:43] <dinnydanny777> Kreia is literally a big coward
[1:53:00] <Space_Pagan> New (old) challenger approaches
[1:53:01] <Doodle_Taco> There is a cool holocron here
[1:53:03] <%Pookiedaexzile> Darth Eczema
[1:53:03] <%Gruhunchously> @dinnydanny777 In fairness, the last time she met this guy, he cut her hand off.
[1:53:07] <penitentpentwitch> Kreia is too busy fighting Darth T3 on the Ebon Hawk.
[1:53:09] <+kapcommunist> edge pieces of the cake are the best slices
[1:53:16] <Manjove> Woolie do the cave yet?
[1:53:17] <dinnydanny777> Kreia is suddenly silent, surprisingly
[1:53:20] <dereks0n> Remember Carth’s son
[1:53:23] <subjectg> the sith lords is a pretty bad subtitle to describe this game, tbh
[1:53:28] <dinnydanny777> Kreia has gone awfully quiet since we entered the Academy
[1:53:34] <%Gruhunchously> Team Crustiy is back
[1:53:34] <DSD24> I love that kick animation
[1:53:37] <Space_Pagan> Kreia she's too busy zapping T3
[1:53:44] <peanutdot007> Why does the Republic not have a million dudes occupying this place?
[1:53:46] <Space_Pagan> is*
[1:53:52] <%Pookiedaexzile> Brought a donetello to a Skywalker fight
[1:53:54] <%Pookiedaexzile> tsk tsk
[1:53:54] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[1:53:58] <XxBigNerdxX> they look like Spiderman noir

[1:54:08] <prince_johnny_> Good times
[1:54:09] <%krispen_wa> FUCKCARTH
[1:54:10] <SuperChumps> I like what SWTOR did for Koraban
[1:54:14] <Halospaz117> Carth Screwed Carth
[1:54:16] <%jillpilled> I think these guys also came to the Mandalorian camp on Dxun
[1:54:16] <andrei11dr> Well in the flashback we do see Sion beating the shit out of Kreia, so it makes sense that she wants nothing to do with this planet
[1:54:17] <+syn_draco> What if Darth Crusty is just a normal looking guy under all those layers of dead skin
[1:54:19] <peanutdot007> You should drop Cath's guns in his sons room
[1:54:21] <dinnydanny777> Would Korriban count as a "valley of power" because if it did then it should really be more defended
[1:54:22] <huskarl_zap> carth = woolies kenny
[1:54:25] <penitentpentwitch> It's probably a terrible idea to quarter soldiers on the this planet. People would keep getting possessed by Sith Ghosts.
[1:54:28] <%Pookiedaexzile> All Carths are Bad...cept for Chinese Carth
[1:54:28] <Space_Pagan> You mean when Carth murdered his own son in cold blood?
[1:54:35] <+Feralspirit41> "And here is where the bitch lord carth brutally murdered his own son while wearing nothing"
[1:54:36] <dinnydanny777> Like is Korriban not a massive force reservoir?
[1:54:38] <dereks0n> The Onasi Screwjob is such a good description of it
[1:54:50] <lotharrio> "Run faster boy! They got a taste for meat, now!"
[1:54:58] <%Pookiedaexzile> Jade Empire carths a bro, but he's not a first choice bro
[1:55:13] <lotharrio> Well if it was stronger, could they possess it?
[1:55:19] <%Gruhunchously> What are you....TOO WEAK?
[1:55:19] <hassanico2> Chat what was the antiforce monster on Kashyyk in KotOR1?
[1:55:23] <%therabbles> if you're dead you're weak
[1:55:26] <+Krecart> to be fair, they are giant, INVISIBLE alligators
[1:55:32] <megamirk> charred mooka shaka paka on the ground
[1:55:32] <+syn_draco> @hassanico2 Tarentatek?
[1:55:34] <+jake5713> Nobody tell Joe Exotic

[1:55:36] <huskarl_zap> Tarentantek?
[1:55:38] <hassanico2> that's the one, thanks
[1:55:52] <%Pookiedaexzile> "fair"
[1:55:57] <JetpackMcQuack> Worth a raised eyebrow
[1:56:00] <megamirk> Twilight, huh
[1:56:06] <ZeeJiggle> "Fair", holding what is the equivalent of a nuke condensed into a beam.
[1:56:07] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @dereks0n
[1:56:15] <%Gruhunchously> Ayjay
[1:56:18] <%xcompleasedad> That's an actual metal

[1:56:37] <%Gruhunchously> HER
[1:56:42] <%jillpilled> HMMMM
[1:56:46] <lotharrio> I think, because you blackmailed the one guy on Onderrun, you can't open both.
[1:56:46] <%Gruhunchously> I WONDER WHO THAT COULD BE
[1:56:51] <Space_Pagan> hmmmmmmmm
[1:57:00] <%HostilePoundcakes> Her you say Kappa
[1:57:09] <dinnydanny777> Mooka Shaka Paka
[1:57:11] <%krispen_wa> Sith Mask
[1:57:12] <ZeeJiggle> It was like "Sith Mask"
[1:57:17] <ZeeJiggle> It was very similar
[1:57:20] <dinnydanny777> Force Mask
[1:57:25] <%Irridium> you can also sometimes glitch your way in my changing party members bumped right up against the door
[1:57:26] <DSD24> That ugly Sith Mask
[1:57:28] <%Gruhunchously> The mask the Pockets wore for the back half of KOTOR 1
[1:57:30] <DatAsuna> Pockets mask, not revan's
[1:57:34] <+Freeborg1997> Semantics
[1:57:39] <XxBigNerdxX> it was in that exact room
[1:57:40] <dinnydanny777> Majora's Mask
[1:57:52] <Aussie_Manny> Oh fuck.
[1:57:57] <Aussie_Manny> OH JEEZ.
[1:58:01] <Aussie_Manny> OH MAN.
[1:58:03] <lotharrio> Where's Carth's son's corpse?
[1:58:06] <%Gruhunchously> OH GOD
[1:58:07] <megamirk> it could've been Yuthura DansGame
[1:58:07] <+doc_ock_rokc> Thorium actually can be a wonderful fuel for nuclear power as it produces little gamma radiation
[1:58:29] <akman14> So when we get the thorium charges?
[1:58:30] <%andrex2311> nope
[1:58:33] <Aussie_Manny> Free money. Like a Steam sale.
[1:58:33] <+MidnightBurst12> nevee

[2:09:33] <%BinaryFireball> 1
[2:09:38] <%jillpilled> likely 4?
[2:09:44] <%shincadad> 2
[2:09:44] <dinnydanny777> Is Yes or No = what?
[2:09:45] <%jillpilled> Oh really?
[2:09:48] <%shincadad> It’s 2
[2:09:50] <+cdrom321> 1
[2:09:55] <%GeneralSCPatton> Is "No" the answer to THIS question?
[2:09:56] <%RioGascar> Pardoxs only fail if the robot is too stupid to actually consider the paradox
[2:09:57] <T_Sasquatch> Lmaooo
[2:09:58] <+kapcommunist> basically all of the above?
[2:10:01] <%therabbles> it is an answer to the question
[2:10:03] <DSD24> This is goofy
[2:10:04] <JetpackMcQuack> This question is terrible
[2:10:06] <subjectg> i think the answer is 2 because it’s not technically a paradox
[2:10:06] <%therabbles> but not the right one
[2:10:09] <%BisoromiBear> Who's on first
[2:10:10] <%jillpilled> The answer is in the question
[2:10:10] <fuji_92> 2
[2:10:13] <%jillpilled> gotcha
[2:10:16] <JetpackMcQuack> That's a contradiction
[2:10:20] <%christopherwpoindexter> Laws of robotics 🙂
[2:10:23] <%FallenAngelZelos> @christopherwpoindexter My brother *Predator handshakes*
[2:10:24] <%hzflank> I would have said 1
[2:10:25] <+Reverend_Roscoe> YOU'RE STILL LYING
[2:10:27] <penitentpentwitch> Which means you SOMETIMES lie
[2:10:27] <%GeneralSCPatton> No, I sometimes lie
[2:10:31] <%therabbles> that's just a statement
[2:10:32] <%Pookiedaexzile> God damn it woolie
[2:10:34] <ainda_> none of these are paradoxes no wonder the sith always lose their dumb
[2:10:35] <fuji_92> that's not a paradox
[2:10:36] <%correctedsun117> How is 1 a paradox?
[2:10:37] <+sirisvirus> It should be 1
[2:10:39] <dinnydanny777> You know at some point most every statement can become a lie
[2:10:48] <dinnydanny777> True statements can be lies
[2:10:49] <gunsrlove> It's a confusing statement, but not a paradox
[2:10:49] <lotharrio> "I sometimes lie" would be a viable response.
[2:10:49] <+Krecart> 1 tho?
[2:10:49] <subjectg> it’s heavily based on the actual logical definition of a paradox, which purports that the statement is true no matter what iirx
[2:10:50] <JetpackMcQuack> 1 is just a true statement
[2:10:51] <sendart> sith logic
[2:10:53] <DatAsuna> the game only accepts 2
[2:10:53] <%hzflank> teachers can learn from their students
[2:10:58] <dinnydanny777> A true statement can also be a lie
[2:10:59] <megamirk> instructors can have multiple students
[2:11:00] <%Camail> 4 isnt a paradox
[2:11:01] <DatAsuna> Though you could argue against others
[2:11:05] <%BinaryFireball> depends on what you teaching
[2:11:05] <ZComiX> yeah but nothing says you cannot lie and tell the truth sometimes. Therefore not a paradox
[2:11:06] <+cdrom321> 2? It should be 1.
[2:11:06] <%FallenAngelZelos> This is one of those conversations where Woolie's brain is going to fry
[2:11:09] <Ids560> this is bullshit, only the siths deal in absolutes
[2:11:09] <%Gruhunchously> 1 doesn't seem like a paradox to me

[2:12:48] <dinnydanny777> I can't believe maths is Sith
[2:12:53] <T_Sasquatch> 9 + 10 = 21
[2:12:53] <+Feralspirit41> Didnt anakin have a blue lightsaber when he murdered all those children?
[2:12:58] <tolloponik> but Grevious has blue and green
[2:12:59] <dinnydanny777> Physicists are dark side aligned confirmed
[2:13:00] <Rainphoon> V is the Anakin of the Jedi
[2:13:01] <lotharrio> Woolie, if it has a direct opposite at every step, why would it be an ODD number total?
[2:13:01] <%Gruhunchously> Exar Kun had a blue lightsaber even when he fell to the dark side
[2:13:02] <megamirk> how ironic... Darth Fann Y'Pack had all the numbers in his pocket, but he couldn't add them up
[2:13:06] <+cdrom321> 20.
[2:13:06] <%Redblood801> 1+1=11
[2:13:09] <%shry7> it takes 10 positions to go from one side of the circle to the opposite. 6 -> 16. therefore a semicircle is 10 positions. a whole circle is 20 positions.
[2:13:10] <dinnydanny777> Steven Hawking was a Sith confirmed

[2:13:33] <%redrins> its the same either way...
[2:13:35] <penitentpentwitch> You would add to one side and subtract from the other side to 'rotate' around the middle.
[2:13:36] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus so you removed kressh but counted simus
[2:13:36] <+Reverend_Roscoe> NO
[2:13:43] <%Graxe_> You have to not count 16

[2:20:40] <%christopherwpoindexter> deep KOTOR lore
[2:20:42] <+ntfth> reminder that Jolee's problem with the Council is they didn't punish him for training his wife after they said no that's a bad idea.
[2:20:43] <Safarihat> he got his powers taken away by nomi
[2:20:44] <+AsinPersuasion> oh really?
[2:20:45] <%Gruhunchously> I think that's right
[2:20:46] <DatAsuna> Yes, I told you that twice :P
[2:20:47] <+AsinPersuasion> i've never heard that
[2:20:50] <lotharrio> I think he was the one to get force-cut.
[2:20:51] <%jillpilled> Interestin
[2:20:51] <%Redblood801> My idea is free to all, just credit me please
[2:20:53] <Doodle_Taco> Yeah I think so
[2:20:55] <+SinisterBroccoli> Nomi did it
[2:20:57] <DatAsuna> You heard it last stream and also in episode 0

[2:21:53] <+MidnightBurst12> tales of the jedi is dope as fuck
[2:22:03] <%Redblood801> If only Wookiepedia wasn't plagued by ads and autoplay videos
[2:22:05] <dinnydanny777> Exar Kun is my favourite anime waifu
[2:22:05] <+wunp_fxs> you should read the dark horse comics woolie. its so fun
[2:22:24] <+SolidusRex> If you want a good time, look up "breasts" on Wookieepedia
[2:22:24] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:22:30] <%Pookiedaexzile> That goofy best selling Comic art of all time
[2:22:30] <tolloponik> when the Jaws had their own zip codes
[2:22:31] <%christopherwpoindexter> @dinnydanny777 exar KUUUUUUN
[2:22:33] <%Gruhunchously> They make reference to that in this game, about the rarity of the Jedi cutting people off from the Force
[2:22:45] <%Starlight_Gamer> nomi sunrider strips away ulic's power
[2:22:53] <%Pookiedaexzile> That horrible Goofy, never was a time more profitable in comics art
[2:22:55] <dinnydanny777> Didn't Kyle Katarn get cut off from the force too?
[2:22:58] <%krispen_wa> Nomi Sunrider was sick as fuck
[2:23:01] <%RioGascar> Well flash gordon did inspire star wars so it makes sense
[2:23:06] <%krispen_wa> Also had the coolest name
[2:23:11] <%RioGascar> As did kurosawa

[2:24:43] <dinnydanny777> V is teasing Wooli
[2:24:46] <dinnydanny777> Woolie*
[2:24:46] <Space_Pagan> big spoilers
[2:24:47] <Joostebrood> Avellone mentioned that he had a real issue with Nihilus being depicted with visible facial features (nose and eyes) in marketing. Guy's meant to be a void beneath the outfit
[2:24:49] <%laserbeaming> I think it does get elaborated on if you are dark side and have restored content mod
[2:25:03] <%Gruhunchously> You grabbed some Sith's Applebees gift card
[2:25:15] <%JaceDarkstar> was 5he karths kid on the ground
[2:25:17] <%christopherwpoindexter> Is V the ONE GUY???
[2:25:18] <penitentpentwitch> Minus the fact that 1 million bucks has a lot of mass. Unless it comes in a credit form like a card.
[2:25:23] <+InvisibleBlimps> Yea it was Bill Gates on Ellen I think

[2:25:38] <%BallerSwagBro9k> WOWO
[2:25:39] <%Gruhunchously> CANNOT COMPREHEND
[2:25:40] <dinnydanny777> Some of the most interesting journalism is when people try to live on welfare systems
[2:25:43] <+Reverend_Roscoe> it's a banana Michael, what could it cost? 10 dollars?
[2:25:43] <+Buzzkill983> It's a banana Micheal
[2:25:45] <T_Sasquatch> 25 LUL
[2:25:46] <tolloponik> George Bush didn't know what a grocery store was
[2:25:47] <%StaceMcGate> It's just a Banana Michael, how much could it be? 10 dollars?
[2:25:47] <%krispen_wa> Door (Nothing)
[2:25:47] <%Camail> yo, why are bananas so cheap tho
[2:25:49] <+kapcommunist> at whole foods maybe! folks!
[2:25:49] <lotharrio> I think... I bought a bag of oranges for uhh... 5 bucks?
[2:25:53] <%StaceMcGate> @Reverend_Roscoe dammit
[2:25:56] <StarlitStunner> There was a Devaronian (the devil looking aliens) companion cut from this planet called Dvakvar Grahrk. He was apparently a sith relic hunter. @woolieversus
[2:26:00] <%correctedsun117> Niel DeGrasse Tyson pointed out that a dime to him is mathematically the same as $10,000 to BIll Gates
[2:26:04] <penitentpentwitch> Though value could change and million dollar bills could be printed
[2:26:08] <%christopherwpoindexter> he WANTS it to be that expensive 😐
[2:26:08] <Space_Pagan> LUL
[2:26:13] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @stacemcgate sorry sbfpLiam
[2:26:20] <%christopherwpoindexter> mm...
[2:26:24] <RantingRavager> Lightning AND yell
[2:26:26] <dinnydanny777> There was a guy who tried to live on benefits in the UK and he said in about two weeks he was staring inside of restaurant windows and felt hungry all the time
[2:26:29] <%StaceMcGate> Has any enemy challenged Woolie in the last 30 hours?
[2:26:34] <lotharrio> Probably destroying all their epic gear on death.
[2:26:39] <penitentpentwitch> Now that I think about it, what IS the largest legal gill in America...
[2:26:39] <%christopherwpoindexter> zoom in on the force storm hand
[2:26:40] <%laserbeaming> poison poison
[2:26:42] <penitentpentwitch> *bill
[2:26:50] <%christopherwpoindexter> $100
[2:27:09] <dinnydanny777> I think he said the most depressing thing was seeing people eating at a restaurant that he might never eat in
[2:27:09] <%laserbeaming> I'm gonna go sell a rich person a banana
[2:27:14] <lotharrio> It's been 100 dollar bill for decades, now.
[2:27:15] <%StaceMcGate> I'm trying to think of a fight that lasted more than 30 secs in the last 10 streams
[2:27:20] <DSD24> I love FF8s Limit Breaks
[2:27:26] <lotharrio> Used to have 500 dollar bills and... I think 1000 dollar bills too?
[2:27:26] <+AsinPersuasion> tfw you realize kotor 2 proves leia could survive in space
[2:27:33] <Djinnazz> Weak, couldn’t even get a buzz off that shit
[2:27:38] <%christopherwpoindexter> more where that came from
[2:27:38] <penitentpentwitch> Yup, 100 is current printed. There used to be a 10,000 bill a while ago.
[2:27:39] <DSD24> I wanna see a Jedi do a blasting zone
[2:27:40] <+AsinPersuasion> renzokuken is GOAT
[2:28:03] <subjectg> @asinpersuasion disregarding the ship actively speeding away, maybe
[2:28:08] <StarlitStunner> @krispen_wa Vima Sunrider, Nomi’s daughter was supposed to be a companion in Kotor 1 and 2 but was cut in favor of Bastilla. She was supposed to have her own book called Mandorla that got finished but cancelled before print.
[2:28:10] <%Camail> it was locked
[2:28:11] <penitentpentwitch> So a million dollars would still be very heavy
[2:28:14] <%Gruhunchously> The room where you interrogated the Mandalorian captive and then killed the senior interrogator when he tried to take credit for your efforts.
[2:28:51] <%StaceMcGate> It's a gun Woolie
[2:29:03] <+Reverend_Roscoe> BUT WHAT DOES IT DO?
[2:29:07] <dinnydanny777> The Sith don't believe in the element of surprise, clearly
[2:29:09] <%StaceMcGate> it's a gun
[2:29:16] <+Reverend_Roscoe> HOW DO I EQUIP IT?
[2:29:26] <lotharrio> No but in Trickster, what does it do?
[2:29:26] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[2:29:33] <%StaceMcGate> nothing, its a gun

[2:31:54] <akman14> There is a really dank political compass meme on the hot page of political compass memes subreddit about the political compass in the year 3021
[2:32:08] <chll0ne> star wars only got political when we got a female protagonist Kappa Kappa Kappa

[2:33:10] <%jillpilled> @invlux Yeah that dude who tweeted that is a fucking clown
[2:33:15] <KnivesEve> if jedi dont have sex. does that mean the sith have sick orgies?
[2:33:19] <YakumoYomi> @Gruhunchously It's just a picture of Palpatine saying "Do it..."
[2:33:25] <%christopherwpoindexter> 🙇🏻
[2:33:29] <%Gruhunchously> LORE

[2:33:49] <%krispen_wa> L O R E
[2:33:58] <dinnydanny777> No go get it tho
[2:33:58] <DSD24> DOes it look cool
[2:33:59] <%krispen_wa> Darth Malak's armor drops randomly
[2:34:00] <DSD24> Oh
[2:34:01] <%christopherwpoindexter> bad trade off
[2:34:06] <%christopherwpoindexter> Sith wants both
[2:34:07] <%Gruhunchously> If it's so important, just save and reload
[2:34:11] <%correctedsun117> WORTHLESS
[2:34:11] <+Feralspirit41> Its possible to end the game with 3 sets of darth malaks armor
[2:34:13] <penitentpentwitch> Considering how impulsive Sith are usually portrayed. It's clever they hired technicians to create consoles to do the teaching so they wouldn't have to.
[2:34:14] <%Gruhunchously> But it's not worth it
[2:34:15] <Joostebrood> Obsidian made so many armors that nobody will ever, ever equip in this game
[2:34:18] <lotharrio> "Maybe he wore this armor at some point?"
[2:34:18] <%christopherwpoindexter> *Dark side gets both
[2:34:35] <%Gruhunchously> @Joostebrood And yet the vanilla game has no ending
[2:34:44] <%TitaniumDragoonNeo> I didn't get the armor in a recent playthrough.
[2:34:52] <%TitaniumDragoonNeo> It's not hardcoded.
[2:35:16] <Joostebrood> well coding dialog, events, cutscenes etc. is different than very slightly editing armor textures (or sometimes just descriptions)
[2:35:19] <%ChoculaUltra> oh man, droids in robes would be sick
[2:35:22] <%Gruhunchously> You're killing everything in seconds
[2:35:23] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Sup
[2:35:24] <%christopherwpoindexter> @joostebrood I KNOW 😖😖😖😖😖 maybe left over of more fleshed out non-Jedi base classes for the MC in KOTOR 1's engine? or for people who only use non-armor Force powers?
[2:35:35] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Its me its ya boy Sonofthedeepsouth
[2:35:46] <$Invlux> OwO
[2:35:54] <%krispen_wa> BASTILA WAIFU
[2:35:58] <%christopherwpoindexter> @sonofthedeepsouth 🙂 coincidental name 😆
[2:35:59] <DSD24> Yay its Bastila
[2:36:01] <PinkSocks> Hello waifu
[2:36:04] <%GrassCannon> BETRAYAL
[2:36:04] <Joostebrood> @christopherwpoindexter maybe i'm just looking at it too min-max-y
[2:36:05] <lotharrio> Why she dressed like a JEDI?!
[2:36:08] <%Redblood801> WHAT?!
[2:36:10] <%Gruhunchously> Bastilla!
[2:36:11] <%christopherwpoindexter> CaNoNiCAlLy
[2:36:14] <gunsrlove> Hello Jen Hale
[2:36:20] <dinnydanny777> Did Bastilla die?
[2:36:21] <StarlitStunner> British Jen Hale
[2:36:22] <%sonofthedeepsouth> whispering
[2:36:27] <%christopherwpoindexter> @joostebrood no, i mean, force powers are better-GASP
[2:36:27] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1268068275423981569?s=20
[2:36:30] <YakumoYomi> Older Bastilla in TOR is hot
[2:36:47] <DSD24> @YakumoYomi She's hot right now
[2:36:48] <%ChoculaUltra> her Bastilla voice is just her Naomi MGS4 voice dammit
[2:36:53] <%sonofthedeepsouth> gonna speak really lisp here like
[2:37:09] <%krispen_wa> It's her Naomi MGS1 voice, MGS4 Naomi didn't have an accent
[2:37:16] <$Invlux> what does that MEAN
[2:37:23] <%christopherwpoindexter> ASMR Bastilla
[2:37:32] <%Redblood801> I never knew that
[2:37:37] <Joostebrood> @christopherwpoindexter i mean that's the point, if you min-max you really focus on being able to cast speed & lightning, and no char in this game that isn't a (possible) jedi can even equip new armor
[2:37:39] <+SolidusRex> I WISH MGS4 Naomi had her accent
[2:37:48] <+AsinPersuasion> its noncannon
[2:37:52] <%sonofthedeepsouth> big thoughts
[2:37:54] <%dorpork> ? Kreia already told you this
[2:37:54] <%christopherwpoindexter> @joostebrood yea...
[2:38:01] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus You get a light side equivalent with carth or his replacement on the light side, you get the info anyway
[2:38:06] <%christopherwpoindexter> mmm...
[2:38:07] <%Irridium> fun fact I got this the first time through and for the longest time had no fucking idea how I did it for a while
[2:38:08] <%Gruhunchously> Welcome to old-school CRPGS Woolie
[2:38:08] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Nah its great
[2:38:12] <$Invlux> Now WOOLIE is getting mind break'd
[2:38:15] <Joostebrood> this game has a whole bunch of contextual stuff you can miss, there's a great scene with Bao-Dur and Kreia that's dark-side exclusive
[2:38:17] <%sonofthedeepsouth> I love when you miss it
[2:38:22] <fuji_92> NAH ITS GREAT
[2:38:26] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Revan did nothing wrong
[2:38:29] <penitentpentwitch> Star Forge goes Nom
[2:38:36] <%sonofthedeepsouth> And Bastilla loved Revan dick
[2:38:37] <%dorpork> Kreia already explained this, what are they even talking about?
[2:38:40] <%NovaKnightmare> NovaKnightmare subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! Hey Woolie, with your growing interest in Clone Wars, does some stuff in Mandalorian become way more interesting (like the Darksaber and history of Mandalore) because you know more now?
[2:38:41] <dinnydanny777> You went out of your way to find this? Here's lore
[2:38:42] <megamirk> Star Forge read the script
[2:38:59] <%christopherwpoindexter> HE AIN'T A CROOK, son...Woolie just a SHOOK ONE
[2:39:11] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Bastilla loves Dark Side dodck
[2:39:12] <dinnydanny777> Star Forge is basically absolute power
[2:39:14] <peanutdot007> Kind of retroactively makes Malak cooler though because he could actually handle that shit
[2:39:18] <%christopherwpoindexter> Woolie is straight SHOOK...for good reason tho
[2:39:23] <dinnydanny777> Power which corrupts
[2:39:25] <+SolidusRex> I don't think Woolie is that far yet Nova
[2:39:27] <dinnydanny777> Absolutely
[2:39:29] <damienlunas> The Ricotta Empire
[2:39:46] <DSD24> That Holocron is gigantic like you can trip and hurt yourself on that
[2:39:52] <penitentpentwitch> They made a rude comment and The Force peaced out.
[2:39:59] <rainhatbellweather> ^
[2:40:03] <Memdosu> Im pretty sure there was a plague that made them lose the force
[2:40:05] <%sonofthedeepsouth> The force is a big meme
[2:40:19] <+Buzzkill983> Long term it would be bad for Sithj
[2:40:25] <dinnydanny777> The midichlorians just start slipping out
[2:40:39] <%Gruhunchously> There was a plague and a slave uprising and something else
[2:40:41] <penitentpentwitch> When antibiotics go to far and accidentally killed off midichlorians
[2:40:42] <dinnydanny777> Midichlorian mass evacuation
[2:40:43] <%vaderxyz1970> Woolie BLAME!
[2:40:52] <%Irridium> @Memdosu I thought the plague just happened concurrently with the force loss. At least that's what I remember. Also slave uprisings.
[2:40:59] <Scrub_Seeker> succ
[2:41:09] <rainhatbellweather> Whenever someone says Midichlorians, I assume they mean mitochondria - the powerhouse of the cell. XD
[2:41:11] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Big Suck
[2:41:12] <dinnydanny777> The star forge runs on midichlorians
[2:41:22] <%Theycallmenerf> Midochlorian is the mitochondria of Star Wars
[2:41:24] <%Xalgar> It sounds like it sucks out the force of your entire species
[2:41:39] <rainhatbellweather> @Theycallmenerf Thanks.
[2:41:42] <%RioGascar> Good answer for why the star forge is kinda not in this game at all when its super broken to just create matter from force
[2:41:47] <Doodle_Taco> They said it was a plague or something like that
[2:41:47] <+Reverend_Roscoe> It doesn't matter how long it took, the fact that it was gone destroyed their empire
[2:41:47] <Memdosu> @Irridium you may be right
[2:41:48] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus it was gradual
[2:41:59] <%vaderxyz1970> BLAME!
[2:42:04] <%christopherwpoindexter> I thought Visas T-posed for a second
[2:42:06] <a_mad_dragon> sucks the force right out of your balls
[2:42:11] <penitentpentwitch> The Deepest Lore: Star Wars is far future Parasite Eve
[2:42:18] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Rakatan Empire animated series now
[2:42:21] <%Theycallmenerf> @atyerservice YW from Parasite Eve
[2:42:24] <dinnydanny777> Wait what
[2:42:28] <%dorpork> My biggest problem with Kotor1 was the whole ancient protospecies thing feels very antithetical to Star Wars. Having one group responsible for creating all intelligent life in the galaxy just serves to shrink the setting down, reducing its scope and scale, which is the opposite of what a good Star Wars story should do. (Honestly it's more Star Trek, if anything.) KOTOR2 gets this right, its plot suggesting there's an ancient, mysterious empire located outside of known space.
[2:42:29] <dinnydanny777> The whole empire
[2:42:29] <rainhatbellweather> XD
[2:42:30] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Show us Rakatan Slavery
[2:42:37] <%RioGascar> the entire empire collapsed
[2:42:42] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Rakatans were a fuck
[2:42:47] <dinnydanny777> The whole empire had force?
[2:42:49] <+MidnightBurst12> All of their technology used the force
[2:43:02] <%sonofthedeepsouth> They abused the force too much
[2:43:15] <Djinnazz> I think All of their tech was draining them.
[2:43:17] <Doodle_Taco> @WoolieVersus I think its like Force radiation
[2:43:28] <damienlunas> How cool would a Tusken Raider Jedi be?
[2:43:30] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:43:39] <lotharrio> The last holdout was, apparently, the planet next to the Star Forge. So they clung to it as long as they could.
[2:43:41] <%vaderxyz1970> BLAME!
[2:43:42] <%DemonOfSalt> @dorpork The Rakata did not create all life in the Galaxy, they seeded some worlds, but most of the time they just moved slave races like humans to other planets.
[2:43:47] <%Theycallmenerf> @damienlunas There is one sorta, old EU stuff
[2:44:04] <%CursedNobleman> SwiftRage WRONG. and not FINE
[2:44:10] <dinnydanny777> Imagine if a Tuskan raider Jedi existed who wanted to avenge his village from Darth Pockets' slaughter
[2:44:15] <%christopherwpoindexter> FROM MY-
[2:44:25] <%GooseGuy99> Could it have been the entire galaxy of sapients was force sensitive at some point, and Rakatan meddling slowly drained most of the galaxy and then themselves?
[2:44:28] <%andrex2311> fuck lands LUL
[2:44:42] <%Gruhunchously> The Falklands
[2:44:51] <+MidnightBurst12> the fucklands. heart of the dark side
[2:44:51] <%dorpork> @DemonOfSalt Sure, but I still think having this random race of lizardmen be so powerful and responsibvle for shaping so much of the galaxy and the Force is really weird
[2:44:51] <ogfruitloops> the sith caves gonna take like six hours
[2:44:52] <resloxxx> @Gruhunchously LUL
[2:44:56] <brachydios777> Or someone
[2:44:58] <%Theycallmenerf> The Falkland Islands
[2:45:11] <%sonofthedeepsouth> You are a star empire cpable of faster than light travel. Why the fuck you would need slaves? You should be able to automate everything. I never understood the Slave driven Space Empire.
[2:45:18] <dinnydanny777> I like the idea of the Falkland Islands being a massive dark side well
[2:45:29] <%andrex2311> fuck lands sounds like the name of a hentai... the question is what kind... Kappa
[2:45:30] <%christopherwpoindexter> PLAY THAT clip AGAIN
[2:45:33] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Jedi dont like argentineans got it
[2:45:35] <+MidnightBurst12> @sonofthedeepsouth gotta flex on the lesser species somehow
[2:45:42] <%Gruhunchously> The end of the Force is a concept that miiiight come up again
[2:45:58] <+kapcommunist> Revan went to the Dark Continent
[2:46:01] <+MidnightBurst12> fuel that ego
[2:46:01] <%ChoculaUltra> lmao, why have slaves when they can literally lift shit with their minds
[2:46:09] <chll0ne> @kapcommunist LUL LUL
[2:46:09] <%DemonOfSalt> @dorpork That's fair. I don't find it reductionist because the timeline is so fast that most people wouldn't even know about the Infinite Empire even if it was better recorded.
[2:46:20] <DSD24> Fann is tired
[2:46:24] <%Gruhunchously> Better dead than red
[2:46:29] <%Redblood801> Red or Dead Redemption
[2:46:39] <$Invlux> it sounds like what she learned is an ENTITY??
[2:46:48] <%GooseGuy99> Could it have been the entire galaxy of sapients was force sensitive at some point, and Rakatan meddling slowly drained most of the galaxy and then themselves? If this could lead to the end of the Force itself, and it exists in all living beings, this makes sense to me.
[2:46:49] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Fuck yeah dark side
[2:46:49] <%christopherwpoindexter> Redder dead
[2:46:56] <dinnydanny777> Imagine force eldritch horrors
[2:47:02] <dinnydanny777> force cosmic beings
[2:47:02] <jorniev> aw shit i got here late
[2:47:07] <+kapcommunist> @CozyGUNNA 👍
[2:47:17] <lotharrio> As a people, but not as a culture.
[2:47:27] <dinnydanny777> Force Amygdala's
[2:47:28] <+Feralspirit41> Or maybe could it have meant the end of force sensitivity in sentient beings
[2:47:33] <dinnydanny777> Force Cthulu
[2:47:34] <fearlesssavant12> as much as I like them talking it goes on for a little too long
[2:47:51] <blizzagan> "It just works!"
[2:47:54] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Rkatans in the their Archipelago be like "FUCK!"
[2:47:55] <lotharrio> @fearlesssavant12 I like it fine in the manga.
[2:47:56] <%christopherwpoindexter> deep lore dump
[2:47:58] <akman14> A star lifter is a real thing that can work
[2:48:09] <+MidnightBurst12> just consumes literal life energy
[2:48:15] <%GeneralSCPatton> Turns out there's no such thing as a free lunch
[2:48:17] <%jillpilled> spiritofmojave subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months!
[2:48:20] <dinnydanny777> The Sith : Worth it
[2:48:22] <GGGodtier> force mako reactor
[2:48:25] <%krispen_wa> Man, Woolie REAALLY loves the Star Forge
[2:48:31] <derap41> But the Force is renewablle
[2:48:32] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Can you imagine how embarassing it must be to the living rakatans. to live in some shitty isles
[2:48:33] <dinnydanny777> Woolie you're talking about the Sith
[2:48:33] <Djinnazz> From the force
[2:48:34] <jorniev> fuck
[2:48:35] <%ChoculaUltra> force succ?
[2:48:36] <Deadbulky> And nothing of value was lost
[2:48:37] <+Jaysky> succ'd
[2:48:37] <Space_Pagan> BIG S U C C
[2:48:38] <+Feralspirit41> Turns out the force isnt an infinite source of energy
[2:48:39] <dinnydanny777> But Woolie it's the Sith
[2:48:40] <%BallerSwagBro9k> SUCC
[2:48:40] <+AsinPersuasion> like a milkshake
[2:48:42] <+AsinPersuasion> drank it all up
[2:48:47] <dinnydanny777> But the Sith are big evil tho
[2:48:54] <+toastybites> Are droids alive
[2:48:54] <lotharrio> Only robots are free of the Force.
[2:48:56] <jorniev> all living things
[2:49:00] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> just like that nihlus fella
[2:49:02] <%sonofthedeepsouth> The Siths are the true heroes
[2:49:02] <andrei11dr> Also, Nihilus is a walking version of this
[2:49:03] <dinnydanny777> I want a robot society
[2:49:04] <%dorpork> There's a reason why this game, up until this point, has left out any mention of the Rakata/Star Forge. Because itt's a very poorly thought out MacGuffin
[2:49:04] <%DemonOfSalt> @derap41 : Imagine a machine that depletes renewable energy.
[2:49:09] <%Gruhunchously> Yeah but Katarr was a species of Force Sensitive
[2:49:13] <brachydios777> Binds everyone together
[2:49:16] <dinnydanny777> Tbh robot society seems like the best course of action
[2:49:18] <+PulsinFufu> inochiDerp so that means the force is chakra?
[2:49:20] <%Gruhunchously> Hmmmmmmm
[2:49:21] <%krispen_wa> Ahh, now Woolie's learning
[2:49:27] <+SolidusRex> Force = souls
[2:49:38] <%Pookiedaexzile> cept droids
[2:49:39] <dinnydanny777> Yeah but the Sith wouldn't care because the Sith are evil
[2:49:40] <+Sarevic> its all clicking into place
[2:49:42] <+MidnightBurst12> 99%
[2:49:43] <%christopherwpoindexter> @krispen_wa 😊
[2:49:44] <+Freeborg1997> I forget, did the Celestials help the Rakatans with the Star Forge? (Not the games, referring to the Dawn of the Jedi comics)
[2:49:51] <dinnydanny777> So long as it doesn't kill them the Sith wouldn't care
[2:49:52] <peanutdot007> You get like one person per planet it seems

[2:50:01] <gabgano> Feels like Revan knew the cost was high, so she used it sparingly...
[2:50:05] <+ntfth> ^^^^^^ No, they hated them IIRC.
[2:50:06] <dereks0n> And you think force sensitivity is rare, this is next level version of that
[2:50:07] <andrei11dr> The force is like Ether in Final Fantasy 14
[2:50:07] <brachydios777> No point of ruling with no one around
[2:50:10] <Joostebrood> how long have we been at this holocron
[2:50:11] <dinnydanny777> It's like the 1%, they don't care about people living in poverty
[2:50:13] <+Reverend_Roscoe> KATAR
[2:50:29] <%Gruhunchously> KOTOR 2, not content to being existentially terrifying as fuck, retcons the Star Forge itself into being a eldritch abomination
[2:50:34] <%shincadad> Katarr
[2:50:34] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:50:40] <+MidnightBurst12> Qatar
[2:50:40] <lotharrio> We don't know how many people were on Katarr, but there was only one survivor. If it's even 1/1million then it's not a viable strategy for long term growth.
[2:50:46] <dinnydanny777> Force Katar sounds like a horrible disease that causes your throat to constantly be full of phlegm
[2:50:58] <%DorianCreed> Qyle Qatarn
[2:51:09] <+SolidusRex> @gruhunchously The Star Forge was always a living monstrosity

[2:54:19] <available_line> @Jontman42 It uses fine mass effect fields to break off the plaque and massage the gums.
[2:54:20] <Doodle_Taco> Mask is cooler tho

[2:55:14] <ZeeJiggle> Alright well now it's a bad joke.
[2:55:16] <BlackermanZX> looks like MGR raiden a bit
[2:55:19] <%christopherwpoindexter> Ahhhh that's it
[2:55:23] <dinnydanny777> I just realised Atton has sunglasses

[2:55:23] <%rosemon5001> doesnt want to admit its trash on anything else
[2:55:26] <andrei11dr> Atton actually looks pretty cool with the sunglasses

[3:15:37] <%Gruhunchously> If you're a female, Sion gets SUPER OEDIPAL, because he starts crushing on you while also vying for mommy's attention.
[3:15:37] <Space_Pagan> It's sooooooo much worse if you're a female Exile
[3:15:46] <olaksi> I forgot about the crush on female Exile, how many complexes can that crust hold?
[3:15:52] <lotharrio> Hey, what's worse? Galactus out in the universe somewhere or a Ring Wraith who wants YOU dead, specifically?

[3:19:58] <Aussie_Manny> @WoolieVersus Little V, will you too be busy in protests to stream again?
[3:19:58] <penitentpentwitch> Kreia: "Don't trust people. Remember I'm people."
[3:20:04] <lotharrio> @AsinPersuasion We could... probably make it. The next part can go by quick, but it depends on how much it sparks conversation.
[3:20:06] <%christopherwpoindexter> *IS revealing, to paraphrase @woolieversus
[3:20:08] <white0devil0> Jack Sparrow. A dishonest man you can always count to be dishonest, honestly.
[3:20:17] <+SolidusRex> Azula always lies
[3:20:23] <+griffball13> trying to create another solid snake from raiden
[3:20:24] <+AsinPersuasion> i mean its a beeline to the conclave after this isn't it?
[3:20:29] <%jillpilled> I do appreciate how she's never told you to trust her and question about everything
[3:20:30] <Joostebrood> honestly this session will probably finish Korriban and maybe get a bit more Ebon Hawk
[3:20:35] <+AsinPersuasion> unless they do the cave
[3:20:39] <%christopherwpoindexter> @asinpersuasion well...there's a cave....
[3:20:40] <+AsinPersuasion> but i don't think they'll do the cave
[3:20:51] <andrei11dr> But do we really have the who?
[3:20:55] <available_line> They'll do the cave.
[3:20:57] <lotharrio> @AsinPersuasion They are 100% doing the cave
[3:21:00] <%christopherwpoindexter> they won't? they got light side mastery
[3:21:01] <dinnydanny777> cave of wonders
[3:21:11] <+AsinPersuasion> ugh shit you guys are right
[3:21:16] <dinnydanny777> Korriban's Cave of Wonders
[3:21:24] <available_line> Cave is super important anyway.
[3:21:29] <+Koover> Lord PB n J
[3:21:31] <dinnydanny777> Korriban's Cave of Stenchy Wonders
[3:21:32] <+AsinPersuasion> cave is underwhelming at the end of the day
[3:21:40] <+MidnightBurst12> The Crusted One
[3:21:40] <%christopherwpoindexter> yea, interesting stuff
[3:21:43] <zeow31> I mean, they'll have a lot to talk about with the cave
[3:21:53] <penitentpentwitch> It seems whatever side Fanny is on, he's able to turn people's Force Sensitivity up to 11. Valuable to both sides.
[3:21:56] <Joostebrood> I really like the cave, it's a nice bit of backstory
[3:22:07] <jorniev> PEANUT BUTTER JELLY
[3:22:10] <jorniev> TIME
[3:22:15] <%krispen_wa> the cave is really important for your charactee arc. but it does kinda end on a wet fart
[3:22:26] <+Koover> I unironically love that
[3:22:26] <%christopherwpoindexter> Especially since Woolie has played 1 before
[3:22:28] <+MidnightBurst12> the man of one thousand flakes
[3:22:30] <dinnydanny777> I like games where the main character is a pathetic loser

[3:23:59] <%jillpilled> SUFFER LUL
[3:23:59] <lotharrio> It's doable today. Depending on how many conversations we have. but it's doable.
[3:24:01] <%christopherwpoindexter> YES, some
[3:24:03] <%StaceMcGate> That is impossible, we have at least 40 mins of Woolie discussion in the cave
[3:24:06] <+SinisterBroccoli> idk that last bit takes some time

[3:24:08] <available_line> V you are the best.

[3:27:01] <%RioGascar> undaunted is really fun
[3:27:11] <Aussie_Manny> Liam fuckin' LOVES CARDS!
[3:27:13] <penitentpentwitch> Play Yasuo in Runeterra, enrage the Orb.
[3:27:15] <%TheSniperJoe> Lots of people playing Magic do that by creating a "Cube", and running that a a single functioning game.
[3:27:17] <%RioGascar> Arkham horror has expansions tho
[3:27:21] <GHouseduivel> Spend $500 on cards that will be banned at the next tournament.
[3:27:23] <+Koover> I had a relinquished card, he was cool
[3:27:28] <%LordSDB> Art is never cheap
[3:27:29] <%RioGascar> as for combo fighter ITS RARE
[3:27:29] <eldragon_1> The dc deckbuilding games are pretty good
[3:27:33] <YamadaZero> Oooh, KOTOR II. I'm about to start a blind playthrough of it. First time through, finished the first game but eager to try the second.
[3:27:35] <YamadaZero> Have fun with it!
[3:27:38] <Aussie_Manny> I had Obelisk the Tormentor.
[3:27:41] <%christopherwpoindexter> @ghouseduivel ^
[3:27:42] <+Zouledge> Spent far too much money on ygo Pokémon tcg as a kid
[3:27:53] <$Invlux> i had ONE ultra foil or whatever Yu-Gi-Oh card
[3:27:56] <+zepelinnn1> no no your cards wont be banned, they will be "rotated out" of the format!
[3:28:01] <tolloponik> season 3
[3:28:02] <prime_name> It takes a HOT minute.
[3:28:02] <%NovaKnightmare> ah thats fair
[3:28:07] <%TheSniperJoe> Thicc with content.
[3:28:11] <blackskulldragon18> DND is a expensive hobby if you are a DM
[3:28:16] <%christopherwpoindexter> @yamadazero save a lot and in different slots
[3:28:24] <%wvan_13> Does anyone know if Woolie is watching Clone Wars in airing order, or chronological?
[3:28:27] <DSD24> Dragon Age was good
[3:28:28] <prime_name> I prefer Mass Effect style
[3:28:30] <%kyh9> What's your preference though?
[3:28:36] <Aussie_Manny> Different characters each time is SO COOL THO!
[3:28:37] <fuji_92> yeah, both are good
[3:28:38] <%krispen_wa> Mass Effect lets me fuck Tali for several games
[3:28:39] <dinnydanny777> Inquisition is so fetch questy
[3:28:39] <resloxxx> tali best girl
[3:28:42] <YamadaZero> @christopherwpoindexter Did the same with the first game! I also installed the Restored Content Mod.
[3:28:42] <MarkUriah> I like Mass Effect better
[3:28:44] <Joostebrood> I really like the Exile as a protagonist - eggregious retcons that it required aside
[3:28:45] <arkv01> AKA do you want dante to coom back in 6?
[3:28:47] <+Koover> I like back and forth character switching like yakuza
[3:28:50] <Aussie_Manny> Someone ask that question on the sub.
[3:28:51] <+zepelinnn1> @wvan_13 he always goes with release order, so i assume that
[3:29:01] <andrei11dr> @yamadazero Well, were about to get to the final act, so you better gtfo if you don't want spo
[3:29:02] <%krispen_wa> I really wish we got a KOTOR 3 with Exile as the protag
[3:29:07] <+kewlmyc> I think I prefer the second, as the first tends to do stupid shit to reset your MC power wise
[3:29:07] <GHouseduivel> Setting up a character that changes drastically from your actions from game to game
[3:29:12] <VJdarkworld> living breathing world PogChamp
[3:29:12] <%NopeBadguy> FF14 somewhat does that but it's kind of limited
[3:29:19] <available_line> I like both. Hawke showing up in Inquisition is legit cool because he looks like the character you created back then.
[3:29:20] <%christopherwpoindexter> @yamadazero oh good, so just in case, you'll have a lot of back ups if it breaks horribly
[3:29:22] <%wvan_13> @zepelinnn1 Yeah, that's what I thought. Can't wait for him to be confused when season 3 suddenly takes him back to events from the first season.
[3:29:22] <YamadaZero> @andrei11dr Oh damn, I'll stick around for the banter then hop off when the game starts. Lol.
[3:29:22] <$Invlux> i really can't wait to play Yakuza: like a dragon
[3:29:29] <DSD24> 2 was not great
[3:29:31] <MarkUriah> 2 was great
[3:29:32] <derap41> origins is great the rest aren't wirht the time
[3:29:33] <Halospaz117> Admittedly, Geralt STARTS at old and tired
[3:29:35] <+SinisterBroccoli> LUL
[3:29:36] <%jillpilled> Witcher aging is pretty solid, though Geralt starts off pretty old compared to most humans anyway
[3:29:38] <%Chatterbox1991> Inquisition is neat
[3:29:38] <+kekkerscrew> Dragon Age 2 has Best girl Aveline
[3:29:43] <%alrobot2014> oh no
[3:29:43] <Aussie_Manny> Xenoverse 2. winsNappa
[3:29:43] <+Creggamonsta> Dragon Age orgins slaps
[3:29:43] <+Koover> Running into old party memembers in sequels is cool too
[3:29:47] <%OldManDeckardCain> inquisition was the dying breath of bioware
[3:29:48] <%redrins> yikes
[3:29:49] <%Javaa01> DA2 definitely came first
[3:29:50] <YamadaZero> DA2 was out first.
[3:29:50] <%alrobot2014> Dragon Age 2 was first
[3:29:51] <%Irridium> think it was 2
[3:29:51] <DSD24> DA 2 came out first
[3:29:51] <+kewlmyc> CURSED
[3:29:52] <%kyh9> I actually liked Dragon Age 2, despite how garbage it was
[3:29:57] <available_line> Inquisiotion was good.
[3:29:57] <DSD24> Dead Space 3 sucked ass
[3:29:57] <andrei11dr> I think DA2 came first
[3:29:59] <308caliber> EA DansGame
[3:30:02] <fuji_92> I like all 3 DAs, but the order goes 1 > 2 > 3 for me
[3:30:03] <prime_name> Dragon Age 2 came first. It had that Issac Clark Armor Pack
[3:30:06] <%krispen_wa> DA2 has a great story, just bad fameplay
[3:30:09] <%krispen_wa> gameplay
[3:30:09] <%Irridium> I like what Dragon Age 2 tried to do, even though the game itself isn't great
[3:30:17] <dinnydanny777> Inquisition needed a longer main story and less fetch quests
[3:30:18] <+kekkerscrew> Aveline is the best female character in the Dragon Age Franchise @ Me
[3:30:20] <+RowenCleric> DA2 came out right around the same time as Dead Space 2
[3:30:21] <+SinisterBroccoli> That reminds me of Arc the Lad
[3:30:27] <+AsinPersuasion> after the 3rd time the bad guys used the same cave
[3:30:29] <%mighty_max_t> Good things about Dead Space 3: Custom guns. That's it
[3:30:30] <YamadaZero> I'd like to see another Dead Space game.
[3:30:31] <+SinisterBroccoli> Your two main characters were on opposing factions
[3:30:31] <jorniev> witcher 4 is probably gonna be a new character
[3:30:32] <dinnydanny777> Inquisition is way too short and has way too much terrible side content
[3:30:33] <fuji_92> Aveline is fucking rad
[3:30:34] <+Koover> Arc the Lad : Twilight of the Spirits had that
[3:30:36] <+AsinPersuasion> youd think hawke would do something like board it up
[3:30:39] <Shade075> like Halo 2
[3:30:43] <+SinisterBroccoli> Koover My man
[3:30:44] <lotharrio> Origins, you say?
[3:30:45] <available_line> I think Inquisition was good and people don't want to accept it becasue DA2 poisoned the well.
[3:30:46] <%Lion_kun> Only good character from DA2 was Varric
[3:30:50] <lotharrio> There's also combo spells.
[3:31:06] <jorniev> im gonna play that this week
[3:31:08] <lotharrio> Yeah there's like 12 different prologues. Maybe 20.
[3:31:09] <fuji_92> yup you have like 6 origin stories
[3:31:09] <%krispen_wa> Inquisition had ok story and gameplay. But the L O R E was great
[3:31:10] <derap41> Dwarf Rouge best start
[3:31:10] <+Koover> @SinisterBroccoli classic
[3:31:13] <prime_name> Elf Slum is the best origin
[3:31:14] <GHouseduivel> Racism CEO
[3:31:15] <dinnydanny777> Some of the story choices you can do in Dragon Age are nuts
[3:31:15] <DSD24> City Elf was rough

[3:31:38] <jorniev> V
[3:31:42] <%BinaryFireball> @WoolieVersus you gonna play some other open world rpgs?
[3:31:43] <MasterDecoder> @dinnydanny777 That's the first one
[3:31:45] <%GeneralSCPatton> They wrote several different Peraguses
[3:31:46] <DatAsuna> Cause it's super expensive
[3:31:48] <derap41> Nah they dropped that shit for a generic main chharacter
[3:31:48] <prime_name> Inquisition touches on the origin but only lightly
[3:31:50] <%krispen_wa> Inquisition as Dalish Elf was REALLY different tho
[3:31:51] <YamadaZero> I've never seen an analogy go quickly horribly wrong so fast.
[3:31:55] <KaitlynnHere> You could just say upper class v
[3:31:56] <%alrobot2014> with inquisition i only saw it matter for Elven Mages
[3:32:06] <lotharrio> 2 has basically a singular origin. Inquisition has a handwaved origin.
[3:32:12] <dinnydanny777> Yeah, I like the idea that you can start the game and be like "Yes I am big evil"
[3:32:19] <penitentpentwitch> Poor Tarkus, gravity betrayed him in the end
[3:32:23] <fuji_92> DA2 is character driven while DA:O and DAI are more world driven imo
[3:32:26] <%Lion_kun> OH MY GOD, I JUST WATCHED THE DS2 EP LP WHERE PAT TOLD WOOLIE THAT
[3:32:28] <available_line> @krispen_wa Dalish elf MAGE, then you get to the Jaws DLC and it pays off.
[3:32:33] <derap41> Origins is worth playing the rest are a waste
[3:32:39] <+Koover> Have a great lunch guys
[3:32:40] <%TheSniperJoe> Seeya in a bit bois.
[3:32:40] <MarkUriah> @lotharrio

[3:32:54] <jorniev> maaaan the wardens ritual is fucked
[3:32:59] <%kyh9> @fuji_92 I actually really liked DA2 had good characters, but the worldbuilding was sort of weak

[3:33:27] <+d_blythie> How long until studios change their names to Blacktivision" and "Nizzard" in solidarity
[3:33:31] <%alrobot2014> i'm sad we don't know where the fuck the Warden went during inquisition
[3:33:32] <%christopherwpoindexter> Y'Toub system

[3:33:46] <YakumoYomi> Again, thanks for signal boosting those research findings.
[3:33:46] <prime_name> FUCK those people
[3:33:48] <%correctedsun117> @WoolieVersus Thank you for those statistics, it was one of the most informative takes I've heard in the last week

[3:33:56] <+UberWolfman> Fuck them
[3:33:56] <+kekkerscrew> Humanity is our lane
[3:33:58] <%TheSniperJoe> I'm pretty sure Woolie has a VERY obvious reason he's qualified to talk about it...
[3:33:59] <GHouseduivel> You mean something that directly affects your life?
[3:34:01] <derap41> Its usually best to link it to people that are
[3:34:01] <$Invlux> I mean you're a video game PERSON
[3:34:02] <%alrobot2014> @dinnydanny777 you can kill him, have him stay possessed in exchange for demon pussy, or exorcise the demon
[3:34:04] <%krispen_wa> Murdering children in DAO instantly makes it the best Bioware game
[3:34:04] <%kyh9> @fuji_92 Like, seeing the social tension build over many years in-game was really interesting
[3:34:05] <+Freeborg1997> In one of your recent videos you mentioned UFO sightings.
[3:34:06] <+kewlmyc> Screw those people. You once talked about feces for a hour
[3:34:06] <DSD24> @alrobot2014 I know in my playthrough he is a Warden Commander in the other land
