[0:01:41] <+Polter_ge1st> sbfpMember
[0:01:42] <0rond> yeyeye
[0:01:47] <+AWr00tBear> More like Cringe Awards
[0:01:50] <%Exiliator> If he hasnt seen it already, Minh should show Woolie that amazing Gai statue when hes finished that part of nuns4
[0:01:52] <%Kriss1827> Kriss1827 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[0:01:53] <mistermastergreg> N A U L T TIME
[0:01:57] <%ChoculaUltra> this is getting out of hand - now there are 2 of them!
[0:01:59] <+Vivaciousx3> i really wanted Goddamn Superhero :(
[0:02:02] <+Aldesso> wouldnt it be better to stop the game after the canon stuff ends and just transistion into nuns4
[0:02:03] <+l33t_j4gu4r> dynamic entry
[0:02:15] <Mothman742> NARUTO TIME?BELIEVE IT!
[0:02:18] <%Kriss1827> woolieGASM
[0:02:19] <spawnzie> Git yer Nart on
[0:02:21] <0rond> nah this game's ending is ok
[0:02:28] <+l33t_j4gu4r> dattebayo
[0:02:28] <+Polter_ge1st> Barf No Jutsu
[0:02:30] <0rond> also to full burst dlc
[0:02:30] <+medinaj1990> dammit woolie stop screaming while I'm at work
[0:02:37] <lambishly> Nani?
[0:02:40] <xxxJahrio> but the non canon stuff is still cool
[0:02:45] <%LeaIsChill> This game's ending is more realistic for what would happen by that point but ass pulls are more interesting
[0:02:49] <catrequiem> The bijuu fight is going to be torture to watch
[0:02:50] <Mothman742> so how much game is left?
[0:02:59] <0rond> "full burst" includes the dlc that is super Canon and super important
[0:03:03] <%LeaIsChill> Four hours?
[0:03:06] <+Aldesso> But i worry about Woolies confusion level if non canon stuff is introduced
[0:03:14] <helidzz> maybe 3.5 4h if woolie goes at a reasonable pace
[0:03:23] <Ultzerostar00> Is the anime part of this game? The Akasuki one, I mean
[0:03:27] <helidzz> closer to 3.5
[0:03:30] <+l33t_j4gu4r> shadow clone jutsu best super power. imagine all the found time of gaming and everything else that dont have time for. naruto op
[0:03:36] <+Bluydee> its like 2 more fights iirc but the last fight is lonng
[0:03:38] <Ultzerostar00> And the extra Daisuke episode?
[0:03:47] <Mothman742> he NEEDS to see the madara stomp of the ninja jobber alliance
[0:03:52] <+Vikken141> ^^
[0:03:53] <+IamScorpius> FUCK YEAH NARUTO
[0:03:54] <Ultzerostar00> Sorry Sasuke,
[0:03:55] <helidzz> if we dont count the full burst fight its 3h definitely.
[0:03:56] <xxxJahrio> I feel like he could beat the game this stream
[0:04:03] <Ultzerostar00> The Sasuke episode
[0:04:04] <xxxJahrio> if he doesnt job that is
[0:04:04] <%Exiliator> Has Woolie figured out who the guys were from the ending of last stream?
[0:04:06] <0rond> y'all forgetting the dlc fight. it's long as fuck
[0:04:09] <+Bluydee> idk if Woolie would want to do the grind for the Kabuto fight though
[0:04:11] <anuchallengertwitch> I know this is shido talking, but I keep hearing Tasuya from P2.
[0:04:14] <%gatorafan> It's hard to remember because he does it all the freaking time, but I'm pretty sure Shadow Clones is supposed to be a high tier jutsu
[0:04:20] <%LeaIsChill> Who has white hair cryThink ?
[0:04:24] <+Vivaciousx3> is there a grind for it? cant remember
[0:04:25] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:04:29] <0rond> enjoy 20 ultimate jutsu's worth of health bars
[0:04:30] <Ultzerostar00> There's the Sasuke one and the Akasuki one.
[0:04:45] <xxxJahrio> special eye powers, i wonder who it could be...
[0:04:49] <optimasmaximas> PEEERSONA
[0:04:51] <+Prevot> get ready for more puke talk
[0:04:54] <+Bluydee> you have to collect 250 chakra fragments in the open world
[0:04:59] <PhantomMaskJr> larxaHype
[0:05:00] <+Bluydee> to unlock the fight
[0:05:00] <Ultzerostar00> What fights are left? Madera stuff?
[0:05:05] <+l33t_j4gu4r> masio yoshido?
[0:05:10] <%Exiliator> @gatorafan Dont they mention at some point how its really dangerous to use for anyone who doesnt have super chakra?
[0:05:11] <Mothman742> also isnt there super canon and important info in the nuns generation game?

[0:05:49] <+cvp5127> Thanks for the HahaDoge @kriss1827
[0:05:54] <nothuzad> Exiliator the danger was enver stated much but I think even sarutobi says that he could pull off at most 2 clones and naruto with his cheater hax powers can go crazy with it
[0:05:57] <0rond> are you team #shirtpuke or team #floorpuke
[0:05:57] <Ultzerostar00> @mothman742 No that's just a side story, I think
[0:06:06] <PhantomMaskJr> @solidnick18 wwtvBOOTY larxaHype cupahBuns
[0:06:07] <xxxJahrio> shadow clone jutsu is chakra intensive so only someone like naruto who has insane levels of chakra can make 100s without dying
[0:06:11] <Ultzerostar00> I thought that was in this game
[0:06:16] <+chesterr01> @leaischill Stop.

[0:08:18] <Hellarussian> Mick made someslappers in KI
[0:08:19] <lotharrio> It's weird to remember that parts of Woolie's life was just an anime.
[0:08:27] <Mothman742> @bluydee tru but it does give nice tidbits of info like itachis op af friend and how the akatsuki were made and shit

[0:08:47] <flowdere> Woolie is anime?
[0:08:49] <nothuzad> PhantomMaskJr both have amazing OSTs but I prefer Max Anarchys a bit mroe diversity
[0:08:53] <+Bluydee> Generations came out between 2 and 3
[0:08:56] <%Exiliator> Did naruto ever touch upon like, what if youre born into this super ninjutsu family with a bloodline technique and everything, but youre like naw I want to do Taijutsu
[0:08:59] <xxxJahrio> revolution was terrible

[0:09:48] <bsmusic> are we gonna go through this game into the non canon ending?
[0:10:00] <%Kriss1827> @vidulasaix 4 is honestly hype af
[0:10:01] <0rond> revolution does have mecha naruto though, is he playable in 4?
[0:10:02] <xxxJahrio> most likely
[0:10:03] <+MrTAteMyBalls> Uh where did they put the money in 4? Clearly not in the Story Cutscenes lmao

[0:10:14] <its_sinny> FOOL YA FOOL
[0:10:15] <+MrTAteMyBalls> i love Anime Stills with Aftereffects

[0:10:18] <%gatorafan> Oh yeah, someone should tell Minh about all the non canon stuff
[0:10:22] <%VidulaSaix> Yeah, in the battles
[0:10:24] <Jetsfantasy> Wait, is the guy singing this dubbed Killer Bee?
[0:10:25] <wbo2> @NemokillerV much thank

[0:16:25] <+projectmanatees> @Prevot no one she is a christmas cake
[0:16:26] <austin9568> @Prevot i hear she's single

[0:16:33] <Makaru225> @prevot I did. I get Tenten in the end.
[0:16:34] <+Prevot> wow
[0:16:34] <+ggbhtg> Hanzo, the Rain leader dude @woolieversus
[0:16:34] <%Exiliator> @Makaru225 Keep trying LUL
[0:16:37] <PaulToon1990> Thanks for the thanks!
[0:16:48] <MyNameIsRasus> The Darui fight is very Jojo ish
[0:16:51] <Dragon_Batman> Yea that is how Naruto sensed something happening
[0:16:51] <%VidulaSaix> They ate his flesh
[0:16:52] <hassanico2> It's split Woolie
[0:16:53] <+Vivaciousx3> his mom
[0:16:55] <%VidulaSaix> They dont have the 9 tails itself
[0:16:58] <%LeaIsChill> They have like 5%
[0:17:02] <lotharrio> Eating pieces of a tailed beast let you have tailed beast powers. Don't over think it.
[0:17:03] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Its fiiiiiiii e
[0:17:03] <hassanico2> It's split between naruto, Naruto's dad, and these two
[0:17:05] <muniea3> 9 tails was in his mom so.... eh
[0:17:07] <+ggbhtg> @woolieversus His MUTHER
[0:17:12] <+texflexrex> they ate 9 tails flesh with chakra in it i guess
[0:17:17] <MyNameIsRasus> His mom had the Kyuubi
[0:17:18] <townzzzzz> power of the flesh
[0:17:23] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @muniea3 Boy she must be flexible LUL
[0:17:29] <xxxJahrio> its just whiskers bro..
[0:17:32] <+Vivaciousx3> does it matter tho? LUL
[0:17:35] <%VidulaSaix> She shaves Kappa
[0:17:35] <Shishi1205> Mom had the good chakra to avoid whiskers
[0:17:36] <+texflexrex> makeup?
[0:17:36] <+MrRabbles> the chakra weakness during pregnancy
[0:17:36] <dekkitout> The whiskers skip a generation Kappa
[0:17:36] <+Bluydee> he was just born with it tbh
[0:17:38] <%Exiliator> She was pregnant with kyuubi inside
[0:17:39] <lotharrio> The mom was better at sealing stuff.
[0:17:39] <rosemon5001> that red head blood @WoolieVersus
[0:17:41] <aracon_> she's too cute for whiskers
[0:17:43] <optimasmaximas> it JUST works
[0:17:43] <Mothman742> oh shit pats also stre- *sees hes playing league* -i dont care
[0:17:44] <Dragon_Batman> The real answer is eh who cares
[0:17:45] <Graxe_> Must have come from Minato's side
[0:17:48] <Arnoldoaad1> just design choice, you are overanalizing it
[0:17:53] <+bluetocho13> because anime Woolie
[0:17:53] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Whiskers are not related I think
[0:17:54] <%Kitafin> must've skipped her
[0:17:55] <+Bluydee> recessive genes
[0:17:56] <+iM_Pnut> It's fun to think Woolie the creator didn't pull it out of his ass.
[0:17:58] <+AWr00tBear> Whiskers is dumb
[0:18:00] <duffydirty> so yall gon pop in that storm 4 whas up?
[0:18:04] <+xx123manxx> He squirted his Kyuubi seed into Hinata so they were born with it I guess
[0:18:04] <spawnzie> Must be those recessive genes
[0:18:06] <MyNameIsRasus> LIQUIIIIID
[0:18:07] <Personified134> gotta be honest this is a hard pick between nart or pats league adventures
[0:18:13] <+MrRabbles> the whiskers are weird puberty Kappa
[0:18:14] <Personified134> went with pat last night tho so I watch nart today
[0:18:19] <spawnzie> CURSED GENES
[0:18:20] <0rond> his mother was a jinchuriki when she was pregnant @chesterr01
[0:18:20] <dekkitout> Harry Potter
[0:18:25] <thetruthofyourbeing> BACK IN?
[0:18:27] <+Noxums> Just now joining, did i miss anything?
[0:18:48] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Whiskers are coincidental I think
[0:18:48] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:18:56] <Dragon_Batman> He made Naruto with it but didn't get any further planning behind that it seems
[0:18:59] <%Exiliator> @WoolieVersus Isnt it because his mom had the kyuubi inside while pregnant?
[0:19:01] <Makaru225> Jinchurikies don't get any visible indicators, people that are exposed to the Chakra from an outside force and then absorb son eof it DO get whiskers
[0:19:01] <+ggbhtg> you aint miss nuttin
[0:19:03] <+DRAGKUDO> her?
[0:19:11] <Djinnazz> True, if it wasn't weeks inbetween.
[0:19:13] <thetruthofyourbeing> That keyboard!!
[0:19:19] <%VidulaSaix> I cant believe Woolie hates GOTY Kappa
[0:19:20] <Dragon_Batman> It is a shame your gonna miss out on some amazing fights
[0:19:30] <duffydirty> my dude minh really a ninja blending into that couch n shit
[0:19:32] <+Prevot> are we talking about GAME OF THE YEAR sekiro? LUL
[0:19:37] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Woolie is GOTY hater confirmed LUL
[0:19:40] <%DaPurpleSharpie> @WoolieVersus do you think ultimate ninja storm 3 is GOTY material?
[0:19:41] <Graxe_> Oh, Pat's live with League
[0:19:42] <Mothman742> woolie HATES sekiro GOTY BTW Kappa
[0:19:43] <Graxe_> Hm

[0:19:53] <Shishi1205> goty indeed
[0:19:55] <duffydirty> damn woolie you hate sekiro? thats crazy
[0:19:57] <%BallerSwagBro9k> BOOOÒOOOOOO LEAGUE
[0:19:59] <muniea3> those weren't your pies Woolie
[0:20:02] <DatAsuna> Sekiro is super overrated
[0:20:03] <ironmandies231> masterpiece
[0:20:05] <+xx123manxx> Sekiro GOTY was unexpected af
[0:20:07] <DatAsuna> It IS a bad game
[0:20:07] <TwinBat> RE2 was robbed
[0:20:08] <%VidulaSaix> I dont feel like it deserved GOTY to be hoenst. It's good but not GOTY worthy
[0:20:12] <thetruthofyourbeing> Why do you hate the east woolie?
[0:20:13] <0rond> the whiskers are a result of your sustenance being infused with nine tails chakra
[0:20:13] <Shishi1205> RE2 HahaReindeer
[0:20:13] <Dragon_Batman> I never would have chose it as GOTY but good for it
[0:20:14] <spawnzie> Woolie hates Sekiro? NO DIGNITY!
[0:20:16] <%BallerSwagBro9k> It's fun the 1st time then u firget5
[0:20:16] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @xxxJahrio
[0:20:17] <Solidnick18> I liked sekiro i played and beat and that was that
[0:20:19] <duffydirty> big hate
[0:20:22] <+ggbhtg> Reminder, Doug Bowser said Smash Ult is MORE than a fighting game Kappa
[0:20:25] <Nina96> its taken so long now i really dont wanna see Sekrio anymore
[0:20:26] <+Prevot> more like Smash got robbed
[0:20:27] <%Kriss1827> shouldve been RE2
[0:20:27] <+l33t_j4gu4r> woolie y u hate fromSoftware???? :O
[0:20:33] <0rond> woolie confirmed for HATING SEKIRO
[0:20:33] <+cvp5127> couldnt finish sekiro either
[0:20:35] <+iM_Pnut> That's reasonable
[0:20:36] <duffydirty> smh
[0:20:36] <lotharrio> There were probably three or four games that deserved it more than Sekiro.
[0:20:49] <Jcool498> From what I know about the combat system of this game, for catching substitutions use chakra dash and catch the opponent with a combo.
[0:20:58] <%BallerSwagBro9k> No Fashion Souls kicked Sekiro
[0:21:01] <+kaiju7544> Volume up pls
[0:21:01] <Nina96> yes
[0:21:02] <Dragon_Batman> I think coming from the other From Soft games kinda warps it a bit. I know it does for me
[0:21:04] <%BallerSwagBro9k> killed
[0:21:06] <Mothman742> @woolieversus yo when u guys gonna invite vin diesel to play the TEH KEN game?
[0:21:06] <fist_wizard_jay> if its any consolation Woolie, I never even started playing Sekiro
[0:21:07] <masterfire23> oh man sounds like he hates it
[0:21:11] <tigerstyle96> Woolie HATES Dark Souls
[0:21:13] <hassanico2> @WoolieVersus Can you look up the Sekiro normal Route final boss then?
[0:21:13] <Mothman742> Kappa
[0:21:14] <+ggbhtg> @jcool498 he knows
[0:21:24] <+iM_Pnut> OST is nice and the games are pretty fun
[0:21:25] <+ggbhtg> Reminder, Doug Bowser said Smash Ult is MORE than a fighting game Kappa @woolieversus
[0:21:27] <ecksbockstreefitty> genuinely curious, do you think you'd ever stream an attempt at getting guild in all sayonara wild hearts stages?
[0:21:28] <+kaiju7544> THANKS WOOLZ!!
[0:21:30] <+Merkensteiner> >Bought
[0:21:35] <thetruthofyourbeing> Woolie hates fighting games???
[0:21:49] <xxxJahrio> is that a stand for a single coke can?
[0:21:53] <+Dragon4234> Woolie hates Gun Volt??
[0:21:55] <+cvp5127> copen is more fun to play
[0:22:01] <ecksbockstreefitty> getting gold*
[0:22:02] <Dragon_Batman> I played Gunvolt, it was pretty fun, nothing amazing tho
[0:22:03] <plushysceptile> Started wondering if we'll see Pockets make her grand return
[0:22:09] <Mothman742> woolie hates video games???
[0:22:14] <+ggbhtg> Woolie hates the bands YOU LIKE, that's all
[0:22:22] <Nina96> zero 3 is still imo the best platfroming mega man game
[0:22:27] <LoneFonte> Copen is sooo much better
[0:22:30] <duffydirty> copen is a lot more fun than megaman zero i said it
[0:22:46] <+redyoshi5> i get that it happened to me as well with that game
[0:22:46] <+ggbhtg> Copen?
[0:22:48] <+Prevot> zero series in general is the best megaman anything
[0:22:51] <PhantomMaskJr> rawrBitty
[0:22:51] <xxxJahrio> woolie really wanted fortnite to win goty
[0:22:52] <%gatorafan> Woolie, why don't you like the thing I like? BibleThump
[0:22:54] <Ashenik1> @WoolieVersus what if i tell you Sekiro's FINAL boss is the best part of the game :3
[0:23:00] <ecksbockstreefitty> what is this copen?
[0:23:00] <Nina96> whats copen?
[0:23:10] <duffydirty> copen is a character in gunvolt
[0:23:12] <+cvp5127> copen is the zero of gunvolt
[0:23:14] <duffydirty> who is really fun to play
[0:23:22] <%JohnAtDawn> JohnAtDawn subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 2 month streak! Woolie warning you now if you don't start choosing Hero you're gonna have a bad time with the final boss and no healing items.
[0:23:22] <LoneFonte> Copen is the other character from Gunvolt
[0:23:25] <Shishi1205> mod the frog into it
[0:23:40] <Nina96> oh that dude i forgot copen existed
[0:23:42] <tookool5678> The Gold and Sliver brothers are descendants of the Six paths therefore related to Naruto.
[0:23:44] <+MrTAteMyBalls> BETRAYAL screams in the head
[0:23:44] <hassanico2> Reggie saying good shit
[0:23:52] <Mothman742> DansGame
[0:23:55] <Graxe_> That's a challenge
[0:23:57] <aracon_> nah legends only
[0:23:57] <1C4M3R0N1> Very true
[0:24:00] <Dragon_Batman> I wonder
[0:24:00] <@Solidus_113> Yeah, the final fight is a massive slog
[0:24:01] <+Vikken141> nah, brute force it
[0:24:01] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Sounds lame
[0:24:04] <Mothman742> DansGame choosing hero
[0:24:04] <+Aldesso> stupid
[0:24:04] <duffydirty> damn
[0:24:05] <Djinnazz> You'll be fine
[0:24:06] <Shishi1205> legends only
[0:24:07] <%LeaIsChill> You're almost at Hero Level 3 anyway
[0:24:07] <xxxJahrio> the events are basically the same
[0:24:07] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Just use Big Bento
[0:24:07] <+l33t_j4gu4r> heero yuy?
[0:24:07] <Futurecity10> Just dont get hit

[0:24:08] <aracon_> fuck that big legends
[0:24:10] <thexiiilightning> Don't listen to that guy tho, you'll be fine
[0:24:10] <Arnoldoaad1> fuck that, GO LEGEND
[0:24:11] <0rond> the final fight is loooooooonh
[0:24:11] <townzzzzz> NO GUTS NO GLORY
[0:24:11] <Nina96> just brute force it
[0:24:12] <%JohnAtDawn> There is literally almost no difference
[0:24:13] <Shishi1205> back down hero
[0:24:13] <1C4M3R0N1> He is going to brute force it
[0:24:14] <Solidnick18> no backdowns
[0:24:14] <+ThirdofOne> Woolie ain't no bitch. Keep Legend son
[0:24:16] <+Vikken141> yes
[0:24:18] <duffydirty> naruto is easy why does he need a warning
[0:24:19] <+Itselguapo> Why not both?
[0:24:20] <%Exiliator> Woolie aint no coward
[0:24:20] <favadem> solid adivice
[0:24:20] <+MrTAteMyBalls> epic maymay choice
[0:24:21] <bethore> Just git gud so you don't need items Kappa
[0:24:22] <%JohnAtDawn> This choice is really silly
[0:24:23] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YOU CAN BUY HEALING ITENS
[0:24:23] <+Superbro64> GO LEGEND OR GO HOME
[0:24:24] <MyNameIsRasus> Final boss is filler anyway
[0:24:24] <helidzz> I say go Legend
[0:24:25] <Mothman742> ONLY LEGEND RUN LETS GO
[0:24:25] <+ggbhtg> DONT PUSS OUT
[0:24:26] <mankeymania> LEGENDAIRY
[0:24:27] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Don't be a coward
[0:24:28] <+kaiju7544> Don’t believe it! Healing items are for pussies!
[0:24:28] <Sedrelic> dont heard the puny baby
[0:24:28] <+NiSoKr> I remember the dlc final boss being super hard
[0:24:29] <Varadox> Ignore him, you can do Legend.
[0:24:29] <1C4M3R0N1> Woolie isn't very good though
[0:24:29] <+redyoshi5> you will be fine
[0:24:29] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> The Ledgend version of the last boss is the worst boss in the entire series. No reaally Woolie. Its REALLY BAD
[0:24:30] <+iM_Pnut> @WoolieVersus Legend all the way. We die like stupid costumed Ninja.
[0:24:30] <+DRAGKUDO> fuck that guy
[0:24:33] <Dragon_Batman> but is it an actual smart idea for LP purposes?
[0:24:34] <duffydirty> woolie if you dont play this easyass game bro lol
[0:24:36] <Ultzerostar00> Are we at the endgame?
[0:24:38] <Ianrazz> Legend all the way, NO PUSS OUT
[0:24:38] <%gatorafan> @solidus_113, should they do the final fight? Considering the way the game deviates from the anime/manga?
[0:24:40] <Shishi1205> ride or die
[0:24:45] <Bakefowl> Just press square 4Head
[0:24:46] <favadem> healing items dont affect score
[0:24:48] <0rond> go with legend, the fight will be thought either way
[0:24:49] <wbo2> hero sounds like baby mode to me
[0:24:50] <+kaiju7544> Legend all the way!!!
[0:24:50] <mankeymania> it's not hard
[0:24:52] <%BallerSwagBro9k> EASY MODE IS NOW SELECTABLE
[0:24:53] <duffydirty> just abuse chakra dash
[0:24:58] <Futurecity10> @WoolieVersus I never went hero, you'll be fine, but it will be a bit difficult
[0:24:58] <didjorno> LEGEND
[0:24:59] <%ozzrabbit> You can always just go back and grind for items off screen
[0:24:59] <RICE02> nobody uses healing items anyway
[0:24:59] <%BallerSwagBro9k> BUT WILL YOU?
[0:25:02] <1C4M3R0N1> Get good Woolie
[0:25:02] <Solidnick18> idk
[0:25:04] <+MrRabbles> brute force has yet to fail
[0:25:04] <%BallerSwagBro9k> GIT GUD
[0:25:05] <didjorno> LEGEND ONLY LET'S GO
[0:25:06] <%LeaIsChill> You'll be fine dog
[0:25:09] <alexandrecau> morst
[0:25:12] <duffydirty> no you dont
[0:25:13] <bpbranmuffin> I mean, yeha if you arent bad its fine lol
[0:25:27] <Shishi1205> roses are red, violets are blue, easy mode is now selectable
[0:25:29] <didjorno> don't be a scrub bitch
[0:25:36] <duffydirty> legend is easy mode tho
[0:25:37] <hassanico2> The real warning should be that the game ending is completely made up and noncannon cause they hadn't catched up t o the anime
[0:25:37] <catrequiem> This is Choji vs Gedo on steroids
[0:25:38] <1C4M3R0N1> Just needs to git gud
[0:25:38] <MyNameIsRasus> HERO IS FOR PUSSIES
[0:25:40] <Nina96> i think woolie can do it
[0:25:41] <+NiSoKr> You also really sucked at storm 2
[0:25:48] <Mothman742> woolie u are too AMAZING for hero
[0:25:48] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:25:51] <+Bluydee> the only choice left anyways is the last battle right?
[0:25:59] <duffydirty> it's mad doable
[0:25:59] <+iM_Pnut> We're getting to the meat of it. Can't wait.
[0:25:59] <%VidulaSaix> Remember chat he spent hours on Fume Knight
[0:26:01] <%VidulaSaix> It's fine
[0:26:03] <nitro4life2> OMIKRON!
[0:26:03] <favadem> u could use the hero pallete and keep playing legend
[0:26:06] <+Vikken141> its fine
[0:26:07] <Solidnick18> will see
[0:26:09] <Dragon_Batman> Woolie will do it but it's just a matter of how long
[0:26:10] <+ggbhtg> Remember chat YOU DON'T EXIST so you can't complain about retries Kappa
[0:26:10] <%gatorafan> I mean, there is that Goemon game.
[0:26:10] <1C4M3R0N1> Woolie needs to get better though
[0:26:14] <favadem> its hard as fuck
[0:26:15] <%BallerSwagBro9k> MYSTICAL NINJA WOOLIE?
[0:26:17] <Nina96> fume knight...
[0:26:18] <%gatorafan> TOP FIVE
[0:26:19] <zayasu> fume knight Kreygasm
[0:26:19] <+kaiju7544> Chakra dash cancel during up attacks to keep combo in air before combo finish is what it’s all about.
[0:26:20] <+projectmanatees> you did reboot woolie so im proud of you c:
[0:26:20] <Solidnick18> oh man fume knight
[0:26:20] <Graxe_> Reboot LP?
[0:26:25] <gunsrlove> He won't know now, that we wont see Sword Saint
[0:26:26] <austin9568> Fume Boys
[0:26:29] <duffydirty> John why did you gas this easyass game up they're talking about fume knight now lol
[0:26:31] <+Bluydee> the reboot LP LUL
[0:26:36] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Fume Knight was hard as balls
[0:26:37] <alexandrecau> what about reboot where it needed mikedude?
[0:26:40] <tookool5678> Naruto, Gold and Sliver brothers' whiskers are clan related to six paths.
[0:26:40] <%Youknowwhyimhere008> I thought the red controller was some nice shoes reggie was wearing
[0:26:40] <Shishi1205> I went Vs fume without knowing about the statues and almost killed him lmao
[0:26:48] <PhantomMaskJr> When's Goemon wwtv10
[0:26:49] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> I am actually genuinely scared you wont actually be able to beat this boss Woolie
[0:26:50] <hassanico2> Is Fume Knight top 5 hardest souls bosses?
[0:26:51] <1C4M3R0N1> Fume knight better than Artorius makes me feel ill
[0:26:52] <%VidulaSaix> @Youknowwhyimhere008 LUL
[0:26:53] <Shishi1205> the got his gs and fucked everything else
[0:26:55] <+kaiju7544> The name of the game is substitutions. If you can get your opponent to substitute before you, you’ve won.
[0:26:59] <Dragon_Batman> yea and during the one that made it Past offered to pay can fare
[0:27:01] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I beat him once with like 1hp left
[0:27:01] <duffydirty> Woolie Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 is nowhere near as hard as Fume Knight
[0:27:05] <Ashenik1> Woolie Sekiro has the best final boss of all the souls games :3
[0:27:05] <favadem> remember this is NUNS, the dificulty is not rewarding
[0:27:06] <+ggbhtg> PRO Gamers
[0:27:07] <Ianrazz> You will be fine Woolie, these Naruto games are really simple to brute force It. You've been doing that all the time with this LP, you will be fine
[0:27:07] <+kaiju7544> Blocking and throwing are paramount:
[0:27:09] <Nina96> orphan of kos is still the most bs boss fromsoft has made imo
[0:27:10] <Dragon_Batman> Pat*
[0:27:14] <WanderingSwordsman> nah, let pat suffer
[0:27:23] <%VidulaSaix> Weird flex
[0:27:26] <plushysceptile> Woolie confirmed monster
[0:27:26] <hassanico2> LUL that's not a feat WOolie
[0:27:30] <0rond> you did? wow
[0:27:37] <Djinnazz> Wow...
[0:27:38] <Shishi1205> sans is hard
[0:27:39] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Woolie loves the genocide
[0:27:39] <fist_wizard_jay> HOW ABOUT THAT TUH KEN
[0:27:41] <Ashenik1> @Nina96 yeah i think it is the hardest but fuck no really tah enjoyable ;d
[0:27:41] <duffydirty> LMAO

[0:45:44] <fist_wizard_jay> the ginkaku kinkaku fight was pretty cool actually
[0:45:44] <hassanico2> @duffydirty Isn't this Troy Baker?

[0:45:47] <Graxe_> Yes
[0:45:50] <Kiraklene> Why is it not red
[0:45:52] <Graxe_> When he was nailed up
[0:45:52] <Jetsfantasy> It went white when he undid everything
[0:45:52] <TwinBat> it turns white
[0:45:53] <%VidulaSaix> It went grey when he exhausted his power
[0:45:58] <%duffydirty> @hassanico2 Nagato? No
[0:46:00] <falconx9k> Ran out of dye
[0:46:01] <+xx123manxx> when he used his power it turned white and he died real hard
[0:46:02] <Jetsfantasy> It went white when he did that
[0:46:02] <+ggbhtg> CHAKRA MODO
[0:46:03] <+Bluydee> after he used the Pure Resurrection
[0:46:05] <+JacknZack27> It turned grey after he died
[0:46:08] <%sporeian94> My first three animes were Evangelion, Cowboy Bebop, and Welcome To The NHK
[0:46:13] <Shishi1205> when he revived the leaf
[0:46:15] <1C4M3R0N1> When he died
[0:46:15] <0rond> when he drained his own life power to revive everyone in the leaf it turned white
[0:46:19] <%Kitafin> turned white upon using resurrection jutsu
[0:46:20] <Nina96> he bleached it?
[0:46:22] <Malikwest11> it turned when he died
[0:46:23] <TwinBat> turned white when he revived everyone, which also killed him
[0:46:23] <+texflexrex> his hair turned white when he revived everyone
[0:46:32] <fist_wizard_jay> yeah but he lost his hair color from over using the rinnegan
[0:46:33] <%duffydirty> this anime is so stupid lol i love it
[0:46:33] <Dumple_Roe> pigments on the hair looses color after death
[0:46:38] <hassanico2> So Chat, why is Nagato tired even in death?
[0:46:39] <MyNameIsRasus> He used the Rez jutsu so his hair is white now
[0:46:39] <fist_wizard_jay> which also killed him
[0:46:41] <Solidnick18> oh kabuto
[0:46:45] <+Polter_ge1st> It went white after the Resurrection Jutsu
[0:46:56] <CozyGUNNA> @hassanico2 because of resurrection Jutsu
[0:46:57] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:47:03] <plushysceptile> I find it so weird that they're so willing to chill and chat after dying if it weren't for Kabuto
[0:47:03] <austin9568> Kabuto:Cut this Talk no Jutsu bull
[0:47:03] <%duffydirty> HOW DOES BEE KNOW THIS
[0:47:07] <dekkitout> It's like poetry
[0:47:07] <hassanico2> @CozyGUNNA did it wreck his body that bad?
[0:47:08] <+DaSkeeters> WoolieVersus rerebirth cause hair to loose color
[0:47:19] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It's because Killer Bee is the real protagonist
[0:47:19] <MyNameIsRasus> Fool ya fool
[0:47:21] <0rond> btw nagato as a fighter is a really cool character
[0:47:22] <Dragon_Batman> Most people come back the way they had died
[0:47:26] <+Superbro64> ctrl c, ctrl v, yada yada
[0:47:27] <+xx123manxx> bakayaro knoyaro

[0:47:47] <+cvp5127> they ALL had to go
[0:47:49] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Yeah Itachi was an idiot
[0:47:51] <+iM_Pnut> One was a god, and the other listens to alt rock.
[0:47:52] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Nagato is my favorite character to play in this game...hes also one of the most busted

[0:47:54] <Shishi1205> would have been better for all
[0:47:56] <%Exiliator> I mean he left one alive, and see how that turned out
[0:48:00] <+hardwiredfire> Obito killed most of the people. Itachi mostly killed the adults and other ninja.

[0:54:14] <+ggbhtg> IT GOT AWAY Kappa

[0:54:56] <%This_is_Marco> ehh idk LUL
[0:54:58] <Arek_1> "Yeah, that's 'how.' But 'why?'" LUL
[0:54:59] <+Vikken141> yes
[0:55:00] <Personified134> yeah but shut up
[0:55:01] <Nina96> yes
[0:55:03] <Shishi1205> reanimation
[0:55:04] <%duffydirty> shut up woolie
[0:55:07] <%duffydirty> NO SHUT UP
[0:55:10] <falconx9k> Don't worry about it
[0:55:10] <1C4M3R0N1> yea don't worry about it
[0:55:11] <Personified134> the answer is NO SHUT UP
[0:55:12] <+JacknZack27> No, but reanimated
[0:55:12] <Solidnick18> shhhh
[0:55:13] <TwinBat> it's not their real body woolie
[0:55:13] <aracon_> so
[0:55:14] <paul248248> my boydem woolie
[0:55:14] <+DaSkeeters> Boruto’s dad is a little slow WoolieVersus
[0:55:17] <+Ryu_R> it regenerates it probably
[0:55:18] <+Superbro64> reanimation is fucking broken
[0:55:18] <1C4M3R0N1> shhhhh
[0:55:22] <Ultimatefool> Why didn't they just DUPE THE RINNEGAN EYES THEN
[0:55:25] <Memitim> it recreates them to where they were like before they died
[0:55:26] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Wow, I can't believe Killer Bee is fucking dead
[0:55:27] <+fizzguy47> Don't think about it
[0:55:33] <aracon_> you could infinite rinnegans technically
[0:55:37] <MyNameIsRasus> Its a copy of their bodies,
[0:55:37] <+Theatricxs> Rip Killer Bee, the only good Naruto character
[0:55:39] <%VidulaSaix> No Zabuza summoned his own sword
[0:55:39] <1C4M3R0N1> DONT THINK ABOUT IT
[0:55:40] <TITOtheGamingGod> TITOtheGamingGod subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:55:41] <+medinaj1990> not that there are a million and a half potholes and Naruto but will he's sniffing around one of the biggest
[0:55:43] <Belutima> Yup, reanimate is OP
[0:55:44] <%duffydirty> he's too NICE
[0:55:51] <+iM_Pnut> I think Madara only took one eye @WoolieVersus
[0:55:57] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Sadly not big money fight
[0:55:59] <trickquestionz> Alright, this is bullshit I'm tapping out
[0:56:02] <0rond> @woolieversus btw the uzumaki special ability is having lots of life force, that why kushina survived having the nine tails extracted (even though it killed gaara) and why nagato was able to revive the entire leaf village with his own life force (usually it will take a person's entire life to revive one person)
[0:56:05] <+texflexrex> but this nagato has both eyes
[0:56:06] <%LeaIsChill> PRETTY MUCH
[0:56:08] <aracon_> just grind rinnegan eyes off nagato
[0:56:08] <+Bluydee> Madara snatches both eyes
[0:56:10] <Solidnick18> that's right
[0:56:11] <%BallerSwagBro9k> SHUT UP WOOLIE LUL
[0:56:17] <%VidulaSaix> @iM_Pnut No thats wrong
[0:56:18] <+Vikken141> no
[0:56:18] <Zeemod155> The body changes to the shape of its reanimated target. Hair/height/internal organs/muscles
[0:56:19] <%Exiliator> No
[0:56:19] <%LeaIsChill> Dude...Woolie is gonna lose his shit
[0:56:20] <1C4M3R0N1> Nope
[0:56:24] <MyNameIsRasus> No
[0:56:24] <+the_vedo_show> atpRtsd
[0:56:25] <Nina96> a lot of naruto is shut up
[0:56:25] <%duffydirty> woolie watches too much jojo he wants an explanation for all this dumb shit lol
[0:56:26] <Ultimatefool> Rinnegan DUPLICATION GLITCH <- Click here to find out!
[0:56:28] <+ggbhtg> SHUT UP SHIT THE HELL DOWN
[0:56:30] <%ozzrabbit> Woolie, just watch the episode.
[0:56:32] <crimson_force> nope
[0:56:34] <Zeemod155> otherwise what's the point?
[0:56:42] <%gatorafan> Is Woolie's body truly ready for Naruto's endgame?
[0:56:42] <Arek_1> Even though their bodies are missing their eyes, Itachi and Nagato are reborn as they were when they died.
[0:56:44] <+texflexrex> the reanimation just fakes it
[0:56:48] <%Exiliator> They would just turn to dust
[0:56:48] <%Irridium> god naruto is dumb lol
[0:56:49] <Memitim> @woolieversus Reanimation brings them back to how they were right before they died
[0:56:50] <+MrRabbles> This one trick that the 5 kage hate
[0:56:51] <CozyGUNNA> SuperVinlin woolie
[0:56:51] <Makaru225> Reanimation eyes do disappear
[0:56:56] <%VidulaSaix> @WoolieVersus Remember all 6 Paths of Pain had the eyes as well.
[0:56:58] <Dragon_Batman> The Reanimation has a weird thing where it is kinda fake
[0:57:00] <Twon_From_Wakanda> Do they even read chat
[0:57:00] <Shishi1205> correct
[0:57:02] <hassanico2> The Rinnegan only worked with Nagato cause he was Uzumaki right? Had lots of chakra to use it?
[0:57:03] <helidzz> wrong.
[0:57:05] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @texflexrex He fakes it? sipsipGasm
[0:57:07] <Makaru225> Would they work in a living skull tho?
[0:57:08] <MyNameIsRasus> Correct
[0:57:09] <helidzz> But you dont know that yet.
[0:57:11] <+NiSoKr> I imagine you can't take a fake one
[0:57:14] <Malikwest11> they are picking and choosing a period of time for everyone who's reanimated
[0:57:14] <%duffydirty> @Twon_From_Wakanda yes
[0:57:15] <trickquestionz> ONE NEAT TRICK HOKAGES HATE IT
[0:57:16] <%Exiliator> I dont know if you can reanimate someone twice at the same time
[0:57:23] <muniea3> what happens when you pull the link cable when you transfer pokemon?
[0:57:25] <hassanico2> GUNJUTSU
[0:57:25] <dekkitout> Where lighsabers and miniguns will exist
[0:57:26] <aracon_> just pull some revengeance shit
[0:57:30] <0rond> Woolie
[0:57:31] <%VidulaSaix> @WoolieVersus Remember that all 6 Paths of Pain had the eyes as well, on top of Nagato
[0:57:31] <lambishly> You need to keep the rest of the person that eye is attached to. The reanimation is tied to soul bullshit
[0:57:32] <1C4M3R0N1> Shhhhh
[0:57:34] <hassanico2> SHOTGUN NO JUTSU
[0:57:34] <aracon_> put the eyes and brains in tubes
[0:57:35] <+fizzguy47> If clone Naruto cums inside someone, does the sperm disappear when the clone disappears
[0:57:35] <%duffydirty> we need gunjutsu tbh
[0:57:37] <Mr_Rakjo> Danzo IS and Idiot
[0:57:38] <Trigecko> i always forget the byakugan is a thing
[0:57:39] <DSD24> Our eye's have yet to open....
[0:57:44] <%JohnAtDawn> NUNS Part 4: Woolie STILL has no idea what he's talking about
[0:57:46] <RICE02> Isnt reanimation the soul you cant have multiple reanimations
[0:57:46] <dekkitout> Oh man, you think Danzo's dumb....
[0:57:47] <0rond> not just anyone can use re animation all willy nilly
[0:57:47] <%duffydirty> if gunjutsu was in boruto i might be in
[0:57:47] <Dragon_Batman> There is something that happens later that kinda help give proof for the fake eye thing
[0:57:55] <foghornleghorn55> not many know reanimation
[0:57:57] <%gatorafan> uhhhhhh
[0:57:57] <Solidnick18> um
[0:58:04] <HeadsHeldHigh> Do NOT fuck the rest of the body
[0:58:06] <alexandrecau> wait is that how madara got so many eye change
[0:58:07] <xxxJahrio> WutFace WutFace
[0:58:07] <+NiSoKr> Uhh Rin did it in 5 seconds
[0:58:12] <+MrRabbles> Orochmaru can pull whatever bullshit he wants with magic and medicine so why not
[0:58:13] <CozyGUNNA> lmaoooo
[0:58:14] <Arek_1> Edo Tensei is hella forbidden. And probably hard to accomplish.
[0:58:16] <0rond> you can't pluck out reanimated rinnegan, it will stop being a rinnegan and become dirt
[0:58:17] <+xx123manxx> they didnt turn the volume down NotLikeThis
[0:58:20] <trickquestionz> "pluck the eye out and fuck the rest of the body." -Woolie the Nechrophilac stole my grandma's corpse
[0:58:25] <%Kitafin> hes all six in one
[0:58:31] <%duffydirty> reanimation is too hard tho
[0:58:33] <+ggbhtg> @woolieversus game audio loud af
[0:58:38] <justindykes16> Youd have 2 keep the reanimation going 4ever
[0:58:39] <+texflexrex> why need a whole other person?
[0:58:40] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @xx123manxx Were LEGENDs its fine
[0:58:46] <1C4M3R0N1> Id do that
[0:58:47] <Shishi1205> that's a movie
[0:58:49] <Arnoldoaad1> basically the plot of The Island
[0:58:52] <+Prevot> BIG LOUD
[0:58:53] <hassanico2> Is that black hole a grab?
[0:59:02] <DatAsuna> I love the island
[0:59:04] <crimson_force> the island with Scarlett Johansson
[0:59:05] <jase__x> Orochimaru does shit like that
[0:59:05] <Belutima> That is a movie
[0:59:05] <0rond> @woolieversus if you can get hit by nagato's ult. it's pretty neat
[0:59:08] <Dragon_Batman> The person is a live person to house the soul of the reanimated
[0:59:09] <+texflexrex> if you can clone a whole person you can close individual organs i'd bet
[0:59:10] <%Exiliator> Isnt that more or less what got orochimaru in trouble
[0:59:11] <%Irridium> I mean if you just clone the organs, fine, but a whole-ass dude? that's fucked up
[0:59:12] <trickquestionz> Naruto World is down for child soldiers they'd totally be down with cloning
[0:59:14] <nothuzad> @WoolieVersus game audio is overpowering you guys talking
[0:59:17] <alexandrecau> island is a michael bay movie
[0:59:19] <+fizzguy47> China says what?
[0:59:20] <MyNameIsRasus> Someone should play Observer
[0:59:21] <Graxe_> Considering what happens when the reanimated body gets injured, I don't think you can steal organs and stuff from them.
[0:59:24] <0rond> yoooo combo
[0:59:29] <0rond> you did combo
[0:59:29] <%duffydirty> is what nagato's doing technically a flex?
[0:59:35] <%gatorafan> @mynameisrasus, Pat did
[0:59:36] <Ashenik1> Cloning your organs should be fine though
[0:59:44] <Shishi1205> the reanimation jutsu having no drawbacks is ba
[0:59:46] <Shishi1205> bs
[0:59:47] <+xx123manxx> Woolie learned how to play good what a champ
[0:59:51] <+ggbhtg> @woolieversus Soon
[0:59:53] <Arek_1> Holy shit, watch this in the anime, PLS.
[0:59:54] <tookool5678> you dodge his super.
[0:59:54] <Solidnick18> he so fast like the yellow flash
[0:59:56] <+Bluydee> reanimated ninja aren't really people but like dust beings from how they fade away and regenerate
[0:59:59] <hassanico2> You don't have a Super cause of permanent Awakening mode right?
[1:00:02] <Shishi1205> also game volume is a bit loud
[1:00:03] <+projectmanatees> using clone organs was just the plot of policenauts
[1:00:03] <+NiSoKr> IT JUST WORKS
[1:00:04] <hassanico2> Or is it cause plot?
[1:00:06] <trickquestionz> Why does this make LESS sense than JoJo?
[1:00:10] <%Exiliator> Yeah Reggie is right I think
[1:00:11] <Graxe_> The bodies are just dust and garbage and stuff.
[1:00:17] <%duffydirty> yeah go head and watch that anime
[1:00:20] <%Exiliator> Need the soul
[1:00:22] <%VidulaSaix> @WoolieVersus Remember that all 6 Paths of Pain had the eyes as well, on top of Nagato
[1:00:25] <helidzz> @WoolieVersus the anime/manga shows way you can't just take the eyes from the reanimations
[1:00:28] <0rond> that's not how it works dammit
[1:00:29] <Makaru225> wait, a rinnegan awakens when you pop sharigan eyes into a senju homie
[1:00:30] <+GreenCMD> it's not sorta
[1:00:30] <hassanico2> Is this Naruto's super the bijudama?
[1:00:31] <+xx123manxx> @chesterr01 @WoolieVersus Game audio is loud and in battles we can barely hear you talk
[1:00:33] <Dragon_Batman> There is an episode that explains the REanimation that happens before the war
[1:00:34] <dekkitout> That's what a nitpicker would call a plot hole tajRLY
[1:00:36] <gunsrlove> .....AT THIS POINT he says
[1:00:42] <helidzz> why*
[1:00:51] <Shishi1205> audio a tad high
[1:00:52] <%VidulaSaix> And yeah game audio is a bit loud in gameplay
[1:00:52] <spawnzie> yes game is loud
[1:00:54] <Makaru225> so Nagato only needed a magenkyo sharingan put into the corpse in order to get a tinnegan again
[1:00:56] <Malikwest11> he's awakened he doesn't
[1:00:56] <+ggbhtg> kinda loud
[1:00:59] <1C4M3R0N1> LOUD GAME
[1:00:59] <hassanico2> @WoolieVersus game audio is a teeny bit loud
[1:01:03] <+NiSoKr> He isn't a normal character. He's always in install and characters in install don't have supers
[1:01:04] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:01:10] <Shishi1205> a bit lower would be nice (specially fights)
[1:01:14] <%This_is_Marco> damn this part got benched hard
[1:01:21] <Graxe_> Oh yeah, Itachi's Susano can do this
[1:01:23] <%duffydirty> "immediately"
[1:01:25] <hassanico2> How was this part in anime/manga?
[1:01:27] <%VidulaSaix> The warp?
[1:01:28] <Dragon_Batman> What?
[1:01:29] <Ultimatefool> So how is Itachi this OP and somehow jobbed to Sasuke
[1:01:29] <spawnzie> WOW this fight got robbed, Woolie needs to watch the anime for this one
[1:01:31] <fabo_joyful> You cant just pluck them out then they regen because the resurection thing.
[1:01:32] <+texflexrex> warp?
[1:01:33] <%LeaIsChill> This sword is what sealed Orochimaru
[1:01:39] <%LeaIsChill> Then failed
[1:01:39] <plushysceptile> Again, these guys were enemies, but they're actually totally respectful and chill considering the circumstances
[1:01:39] <1C4M3R0N1> Why cant Sasuke's do anything cool
[1:01:40] <Arek_1> Totsuka no Tsurugi. GG.
[1:01:43] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @hassanico2 WAAAAAY COOLER
[1:01:45] <%This_is_Marco> in the anime it took all 3 of them to subdue Nagato
[1:01:46] <%Exiliator> In the anime they show him using all the stuff
[1:01:48] <Shishi1205> Itachi was already dying
[1:01:49] <aracon_> itachi's susan
[1:01:50] <optimasmaximas> @hassanico2 a lot better lol
[1:01:50] <helidzz> @WoolieVersus the warp is not a rinnegan ability.
[1:01:51] <%VidulaSaix> He used that to seal Orochimaru
[1:01:53] <dekkitout> His stand
[1:01:54] <+ggbhtg> @woolieversus sharingam specific, also DON'T ASK
[1:01:54] <Shishi1205> susanoos sword
[1:01:56] <rosemon5001> teleportation is only the eye madara has
[1:01:57] <MyNameIsRasus> This Naruto doesnt have a super because he is technically an Awakening
[1:01:59] <fairore> @ultimatefool anime disease
[1:02:01] <+askalta> there is a difference between 1 and 2 rinnegan
[1:02:02] <1C4M3R0N1> He used it against Orochimaru
[1:02:04] <+MrRabbles> susan is powerful
[1:02:04] <Mr_Rakjo> Each susanoo is different
[1:02:07] <Shishi1205> he "sealed " orochimaru
[1:02:07] <1C4M3R0N1> Susan
[1:02:08] <gordieda20> He used it on Orochimaru
[1:02:10] <+xx123manxx> Everyone gets their own susan
[1:02:13] <justindykes16> The warp is asharingan thing
[1:02:16] <hassanico2> Different color, weapon and ability IIRC
[1:02:19] <+captain_history> The warp is a sharingan ability
[1:02:20] <+NiSoKr> Every susan is unique
[1:02:22] <0rond> you need both eyes to use susan
[1:02:23] <Memitim> He used Susan on Orochomaru
[1:02:23] <falconx9k> IT IS MAH DUTY
[1:02:24] <Sol_Install> Susan is strong and he went wild with it in Samurai 8
[1:02:24] <+AWr00tBear> Number of eyes don’t matter
[1:02:24] <+Superbro64> WOOLIE FINALLY UNDERSTANDS
[1:02:26] <austin9568> Ha Dooty
[1:02:26] <%duffydirty> wait you thought susan was a singular thing?
[1:02:26] <thexiiilightning> Haha, duty
[1:02:27] <+kyh9> Kishimoto made just a fucking Japanese history crossover fanfic
[1:02:28] <+MrRabbles> that's right susan
[1:02:28] <%xdeathknightx> hehe he said doody
[1:02:29] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Susan is everywhere ready to fuck things over
[1:02:34] <Jetsfantasy> SIGHT
[1:02:35] <+kyh9> Also, I find it funny that Itachi and Naruto are on better terms than Itachi and Sasuke
[1:02:35] <Mr_Rakjo> THE SUCC
[1:02:37] <tookool5678> they are Stands, cannot get too far from user.
[1:02:38] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Naruto says: "I'll kill them all! Believe it!"
[1:02:39] <aracon_> oh no

[1:02:51] <DSD24> All cause of that swing
[1:02:52] <%duffydirty> thats just not true
[1:02:52] <+DaSkeeters> That’s the thing that killed orchimaru in his fight with sasuki

[1:03:36] <hassanico2> @Nameless0100 I think that's precisely why he's saying this

[1:10:55] <+Prevot> whats there to like
[1:10:56] <Dragon_Batman> She does get a ok moment here and there at least
[1:10:56] <aracon_> sakura suuuuuuucks
[1:10:57] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I can't believe Woolie would just steal a phrase like that B)
[1:10:58] <thepiefoot> But she gets worse after that
[1:10:58] <wanocountry> Sarada is the best character out of the new gen tbh
[1:10:58] <+Bluydee> Sarada's sick
[1:10:59] <1C4M3R0N1> Thats ROCK LEE
[1:11:00] <%VidulaSaix> Sakura had potential but holy FUCK Kishimoto ruined her
[1:11:00] <hassanico2> He doesn't even get a name?!
[1:11:02] <+Superbro64> BUT FUCK SAKURA THO
[1:11:02] <mrfreezepunsbestpuns> did I miss somehting important?

[1:11:08] <%Itselguapo> Itselguapo subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[1:11:13] <Ultimatefool> Oh Woolie, you haven't even SEEEN the dumbest yet
[1:11:13] <Sol_Install> That was Kishimoto
[1:11:14] <MyNameIsRasus> Sakura fans lolololol
[1:11:14] <+Bluydee> @hassanico2 they mentioned it already
[1:11:17] <CozyGUNNA> @vidulasaix exactly
[1:11:19] <aracon_> she wants to get better, but stays being an idiot
[1:11:20] <flowdere> Sasuke has done the most bad decisions
[1:11:21] <+ggbhtg> @hassanico2 Mu
[1:11:22] <+Superbro64> how are there people who like sakura?
[1:11:23] <Sol_Install> Kishimoto 100% to blame than Sakura
[1:11:25] <thepiefoot> Sakura was VERY promising at the start of shippuden (i'll never forget the Sasori fight)
[1:11:26] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Sakura : I got some good hits in" Haruno
[1:11:28] <+NiSoKr> She also isn't real lol she doesn't make decisions
[1:11:28] <hassanico2> @Bluydee Yeah I know, I mean ingame HUD name
[1:11:30] <%Prinnylordninjocity> SPITS OUT XD
[1:11:30] <xxxJahrio> Sakura has a medical degree while naruto and sasuke are ninja drop outs, don't hate
[1:11:31] <+xx123manxx> I liked Sakura when I was like 13
[1:11:33] <1C4M3R0N1> Sakura fans are the worst lol
[1:11:37] <jase__x> "I love you naruto"
[1:11:37] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @mynameisrasus They're not real its fine
[1:11:39] <Arek_1> The Sakura hatred from back then is coming back, lol.
[1:11:41] <%duffydirty> the only good sakura is wataru sakura
[1:11:45] <+Tearonex> The worst part is that Sarada's probably the best character in Boruto
[1:11:47] <%Exiliator> Dont throw shade at the healer for having low dps
[1:11:48] <hassanico2> @Bluydee Like, "Tsukikage vs 2nd Tsukikage" looks kinda jank
[1:11:50] <wanocountry> Sakura nose dived after the Sasori fight
[1:11:50] <Ransom73> In Bort LUL
[1:11:52] <+MrRabbles> it kinda sucks that this is limited to rocks when it should be fucking lasers
[1:11:55] <+kyh9> Sakura used to be an Illusion-specialist, remember that?
[1:11:57] <Sol_Install> She also beat sasori
[1:12:00] <HollowMan190> Saradra is the best charcter of baruto
[1:12:02] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> That guy is from the Genei Ryodan LUL
[1:12:05] <+texflexrex> im telling you sakura woulda been so much cooler if she had a big axe like kishimoto's art has her with
[1:12:06] <Dragon_Batman> I think simple is really just it
[1:12:07] <+Superbro64> the venn diagram of sakura fans and narusaku shippers is a circle doodSinwata
[1:12:18] <%BallerSwagBro9k> All,u Sakura fans are delusional AF
[1:12:21] <nothuzad> Sol_Install she only beat him by being used by granny
[1:12:37] <hassanico2> Is Mu just using Tsukikage's moves?
[1:12:39] <stormking678> Medical ninja fights looked cool as fuck but Sakura only punches ResidentSleeper
[1:12:41] <1C4M3R0N1> Imagine if Sakura was a strong character
[1:12:42] <+Prevot> AKA bleach char design
[1:12:45] <flowdere> what happened to alter ego sakura who hyped her break out of genjustu?
[1:12:51] <thepiefoot> Did Kishimoto took the day out and let his assistant make the designs for that day?
[1:12:53] <flowdere> helped*
[1:12:54] <jase__x> Boruto designs are just rhe worst
[1:12:55] <wanocountry> Sakura is also the ugliest girl out of Konoha 7 LUL
[1:12:55] <%duffydirty> "bleach character design"?
[1:12:56] <hassanico2> @flowdere never appeared agiain after that
[1:13:00] <+kyh9> They all have cloth designs, no metals or leather or anything like that to be seen
[1:13:04] <aracon_> boruto designs are actually tragic
[1:13:06] <%duffydirty> what bleach characters almost all look great
[1:13:09] <mankeyfigh> I’m not a Sakura fan, but I don’t hate her... I just don’t really think about her
[1:13:21] <+xx123manxx> I got a good 14 episodes into Boruto before it got dropped
[1:13:22] <@Solidus_113> use items
[1:13:29] <hassanico2> I'm over heeeeeere"
[1:13:29] <1C4M3R0N1> He is gonna lose
[1:13:31] <stormking678> @mankeyfigh That's worse than any insult tbh
[1:13:37] <wanocountry> Boruto manga >>> anime
[1:13:51] <+xx123manxx> Get em skeeter
[1:13:52] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> > imagine making Sakura a good character BlargNaut
[1:13:55] <mrfreezepunsbestpuns> I'm buying those Boruto Blu-Rays cause i love the shpw
[1:13:56] <+Prevot> imagine if the characters changed costume every arc like one piece
[1:14:03] <+xx123manxx> clap clap
[1:14:06] <1C4M3R0N1> JEEZ
[1:14:06] <jase__x> close one
[1:14:11] <+ggbhtg> Disintegrates them, yeah
[1:14:13] <+Vikingdeath1> Nice one
[1:14:13] <optimasmaximas> EZClap
[1:14:19] <+iM_Pnut> I've seen shows with way worse characters than Sakura. I'm not forgiving it, but I'm not bothered by her.
[1:14:24] <flowdere> if the first sand kage exist he did bad job protecting garaa
[1:14:29] <CozyGUNNA> one piece has crazy art
[1:14:32] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Pockets? PogChamp
[1:14:34] <wanocountry> Adult Sasuke looks kinda cool ngl
[1:14:35] <Twon_From_Wakanda> Its fineeeee
[1:14:35] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> so the Bleach rules of design
[1:14:37] <aracon_> and then during the war everyone is wearing the same uniform
[1:14:39] <hassanico2> I like Sakura but don't forgive her stupidity
[1:14:41] <+kyh9> Late Naruto designs are nothing but cloth. Not metals or leather or anything
[1:14:47] <+Ryu_R> Iruka
[1:14:50] <Arek_1> Man, being an art student sucks. LUL
[1:14:51] <lambishly> One piece has crazy art and it STAYS good
[1:14:53] <+dj_orpheus> One piece changes outfits every arc
[1:14:55] <+Bluydee> Kishimoto's designs get way worse
[1:14:57] <%LeaIsChill> Dosu Kinata was the shit
[1:14:58] <%Mtome> The uniform is the most bland type of design in Naruto
[1:14:59] <dekkitout> Cause early on, there were like- 20 characters max
[1:14:59] <MyNameIsRasus> Kurenai was sick
[1:15:00] <+Polter_ge1st> Yeah Particle Style disintegrates at a molecular level
[1:15:00] <%duffydirty> why are people saying Bleach has bland character designs? lol
[1:15:04] <+RogueCrocodile> Play the video game
[1:15:05] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1204820081542402050?s=19
[1:15:06] <+ggbhtg> yet One Piece has SO MUCH DETAIL @woolieversus
[1:15:08] <hassanico2> @WoolieVersus Maybe the better way to describe this is "simplified designs"?
[1:15:09] <laguerrilha> One Piece art gets better as it goes
[1:15:19] <Memitim> nah, OG Naruto was way better
[1:15:21] <+kyh9> Bleach has great designs despite half the cast wearing the same kimono
[1:15:27] <flowdere> one piece art isnt good its story is
[1:15:27] <Mr_Rakjo> One Piece is great
[1:15:28] <+MagickBurritoh> but the mesh
[1:15:29] <+Prevot> lol One Piece is the opposite, the art gets less boring as it goes on
[1:15:30] <+xx123manxx> I'll never forgive Oda for ruining everyones designs in the timeskip
[1:15:30] <wanocountry> Kurenai's original outfit is smokin Kreygasm
[1:15:34] <aracon_> straight up just wearing some sweats LUL
[1:15:34] <1C4M3R0N1> One Piece art looks ugly to me
[1:15:37] <CozyGUNNA> oda is actually really good at drawing
[1:15:44] <Zeemod155> LUL
[1:15:48] <CozyGUNNA> outside of one piece
[1:15:48] <@Solidus_113> gold sand
[1:15:50] <+Bluydee> no way One Piece's art is way more dynamic pre-time skip
[1:15:51] <+ggbhtg> Bleach has bad backgrounding, Making characters and designs is THE ONLY THING KUBO ENJOYED
[1:15:53] <+iM_Pnut> One Piece has to do that. Gotta keep interest.
[1:15:55] <hassanico2> Kazekage is just using Gaara's moveset with a color palette swap right?
[1:15:57] <mankeyfigh> Bleach “had” good character designs... until it didn’t
[1:15:58] <%VidulaSaix> He styled it after it. It's not him
[1:15:59] <Pyrrhus90> ninja boomer fashion
[1:16:00] <catrequiem> BoomerKage
[1:16:01] <+Merkensteiner> One Piece Art is great
[1:16:01] <+Taisuru> @laguerrilha My only counterpoint to that is that ALL the women have the exact same super exagerated hourglass bodies
[1:16:03] <thepiefoot> Early on, Luffy only changed his jacket and sometimes his pants. Now he gets different outfits every arc
[1:16:05] <MyNameIsRasus> Just sand
[1:16:07] <Jetsfantasy> Garra did it as an omage
[1:16:07] <Shishi1205> it's just his sand
[1:16:10] <Trigecko> Boomer sand ninjas didn't need pockets
[1:16:10] <flowdere> one piece everyone is lanky and have water jug ballons

[1:16:15] <BreakersAweigh> he's just forming it as sand
[1:16:15] <+xx123manxx> It's just style
[1:16:16] <@Solidus_113> it's hard sand
[1:16:16] <wanocountry> Oda skipped all the important fights tho LUL
[1:16:18] <Dragon_Batman> Shukaku is not in him
[1:16:19] <thexiiilightning> He kept the style
[1:16:26] <MyNameIsRasus> Just his thing
[1:16:26] <+cvp5127> its is motif
[1:16:28] <Pyrrhus90> i hate sand...
[1:16:28] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I dont remember what happened to the 1 tail?
[1:16:31] <laguerrilha> @Taisuru its silly, but its his taste i guess
[1:16:33] <+GreenCMD> Just Sand, It doesn't have the Shukaku blue marks
[1:16:35] <fist_wizard_jay> sand tattoo?
[1:16:37] <+iM_Pnut> "Is that an animal spirit!?"
[1:16:40] <hassanico2> @BallerSwagBro9k forciblyremoved in NUNS2
[1:16:40] <+NiSoKr> Rasa's design is from part 1 when he was never supposed to show up outside of flashbacks
[1:16:40] <Twon_From_Wakanda> Woolie stop over thinking things
[1:16:41] <%duffydirty> yeah gaara knows his roots man
[1:16:41] <+JacknZack27> Its just too make it look cool
[1:16:42] <%Exiliator> They said that

[1:17:07] <laguerrilha> His mother
[1:17:07] <Makaru225> Gaara never really used the real shukaku actually, he just let the shukaku possess him to create it's shapes out of the sand Gaara uses
[1:17:07] <Owkono> muther
[1:17:09] <wanocountry> Motherrrrr
[1:17:10] <Dragon_Batman> There wasn't a fight even

[1:17:30] <laguerrilha> isnt his mother spirit in his sand?
[1:17:32] <+Polter_ge1st> Big Mom Energy

[1:29:16] <+xx123manxx> Why Did Boruto's dads son get an anime and not Gaara?
[1:29:17] <jase__x> ABSOLUTE BEST COUPLE
[1:29:18] <%duffydirty> it's the only couple
[1:29:19] <Arek_1> @bread_assassin I appreciate him because through him, Kishimoto introduced the concept of Yin Release (which most genjutsu utilize).
[1:29:20] <%VidulaSaix> YEYEYE
[1:29:22] <%duffydirty> that matters
[1:29:24] <+Prevot> that's a Krilin and 18 tier couple

[1:29:34] <spawnzie> Hope the game doesn't job the Raikage's cool thing

[1:55:35] <dundore77> no its the main path power he's just pulling a meteor from space. and does it twice
[1:55:36] <RiceeFTW> @WoolieVersus it's called Heavenly Obstacle Quaking Star
[1:55:36] <justindykes16> It’s like a force push
[1:55:36] <mankeyfigh> Rinnegan
[1:55:37] <+Bluydee> Rinnegan is literally eyes of God
[1:55:38] <wanocountry> Bansho Tenin

[1:56:29] <Shishi1205> shinra tensei

[1:56:32] <%redrins> gravity memes
[1:56:33] <+GreenCMD> gravity
[1:56:35] <+NiSoKr> It's all from RInnegan moves
[1:56:35] <0rond> rinnegan planetary devastation is making a planet around you and destroying it
[1:56:36] <mankeyfigh> He used Universal Pull to kill the toad
[1:56:37] <%VidulaSaix> Planetary Devastation is like a gravitational pull
[1:56:41] <+fizzguy47> Sephiroth
[1:56:41] <wanocountry> Fuck your gravity
[1:56:43] <laguerrilha> @WoolieVersus also the reincarnated bodies have infinite chakra, so Madara can spam
[1:56:43] <Arek_1> Pain/Nagato was Chibaku Tensei/Planetary Devastation.
[1:56:43] <falconx9k> NINJAS
[1:56:44] <Kiraklene> All rinnegan users can do it
[1:56:46] <%duffydirty> SPACE

[1:56:55] <tookool5678> Pains power is the center of the world.
[1:56:59] <PhantomMaskJr> gravity squeeze
[1:57:00] <optimasmaximas> @WoolieVersus planetary devastation is shinra tensei
[1:57:02] <lotharrio> The zombies are bullshit because they have infinite stamina, too.
[1:57:02] <+DarkLinkBJ> Woolie Thanos just showed up
[1:57:06] <+ShadowArcangel> ??
[1:57:07] <RedAhoge> Kimari Ronso's true final Limit break
[1:57:08] <Dragon_Batman> Weird
[1:57:08] <alrobot2014> @Ultimatefool *red mages
[1:57:09] <1C4M3R0N1> Cu technically it's time not budget
[1:57:09] <dundore77> madara got SSS style rating all the time
[1:57:10] <+DaSkeeters> Almighty push is more eye power shit
[1:57:11] <Nina96> thats dumb
[1:57:11] <%ultrasparkseid> ????
[1:57:12] <+ggbhtg> The FUCK?
[1:57:16] <%duffydirty> Madara is just Sephiroth
[1:57:17] <scomm29> woolie its time not money
[1:57:18] <wanocountry> Unlimited Budget Works
[1:57:18] <+KingOfTheGeats> what are you talking about
[1:57:18] <+cherokee2391> what if you wanted to fight for the world but madara had the black materia
[1:57:19] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:57:19] <Graxe_> And Madara knows that his reanimated body is too strong
[1:57:20] <Solidnick18> ninjas can do this Kappa
[1:57:20] <1C4M3R0N1> It's time though not budget
[1:57:23] <Twon_From_Wakanda> Great time to read chat
[1:57:24] <hassanico2> No, they just get more time and better animators
[1:57:24] <%torinismyname> Throw money at it!
[1:57:24] <1C4M3R0N1> but yes
[1:57:27] <%duffydirty> it is
[1:57:27] <+NiSoKr> Time = money
[1:57:27] <laguerrilha> Yeah, the zombies have infinite stamina, infinite chakra and can regen
[1:57:27] <%BallerSwagBro9k> SEPHIROTH Thanos
[1:57:27] <+cvp5127> sakuga no jutsu
[1:57:29] <+bv728> Because mostly it's about Time and getting the right folks with social pull
[1:57:29] <Shishi1205> I mean sometimes money is not involved in those moments just hard work
[1:57:34] <hassanico2> No Crunch Vs Crunch animators
[1:57:35] <mankeyfigh> Time is money
[1:57:35] <$Swish19XX> Yeah time is money
[1:57:35] <+xx123manxx> Time is money
[1:57:36] <FuqBoiSlim> it's more about scheduling than anything
[1:57:36] <wanocountry> Ufotable Demon Slayer budget
[1:57:36] <+Superbro64> its time, not budget
[1:57:39] <+bv728> It doesn't cost that much more
[1:57:41] <Arek_1> @optimasmaximas Shinra Tensei is Almighty Push. Chibaku Tensei is Planetary Devastation.
[1:57:44] <+JacknZack27> But time is money
[1:57:44] <Solidnick18> i feel that
[1:57:45] <stormking678> I actually hate that about animations. Where does the chakra come from?
[1:57:46] <Tamarroh> the money isnt increased its the strain on the animators
[1:57:50] <+ggbhtg> @woolieversus Lets jusr push Sakuga more anyway
[1:57:53] <%duffydirty> And he's fighting them IN SLOW MOTION because of sharingan
[1:57:57] <hassanico2> Terminator Vision
[1:57:59] <Graxe_> Shinra Tensei is Almighty Push, Chibaku Tensei is Planetary Devestation, the meteors are Tengai Shinsei
[1:58:00] <mankeyfigh> Better animators get better wages
[1:58:10] <+Superbro64> animators are still paid like shit no matter what they do, they just have to work harder for shit pay at some parts
[1:58:11] <%torinismyname> That's what makes it good, I can feel all the money bursting from the screen
[1:58:12] <Tamarroh> not at all
[1:58:14] <FuqBoiSlim> One Punch Man wasnt any more expensive than your average seasonal anime but the people behind it were passionate but money yeah idk
[1:58:14] <Dragon_Batman> It's more of the Rinnegan having those abilities and the user knowing how to do them
[1:58:14] <+bv728> Budget HELPS, but if you don't have the good animators AND the time, you're not getting the Sakuga
[1:58:17] <Solidnick18> kabuto is like hehehe
[1:58:17] <+xx123manxx> tsuchikage 2
[1:58:18] <dundore77> the animations dont lose chakra. normal madara wouldn't be able to summon 2 of them, maybe not even 1
[1:58:19] <1C4M3R0N1> 2ND tSUCHI
[1:58:20] <0rond> there's almighty pull too, nagato does that
[1:58:20] <+stef5949> It's like something about talent playing a bigger role, coming from people who don't know how production works
[1:58:21] <lotharrio> Second Tsuchi
[1:58:22] <optimasmaximas> @Arek_1 yeah ik i was just telling them what it was called
[1:58:24] <RedAhoge> "The new generation will surpass the old generation"
[1:58:26] <wanocountry> @graxe_ what about Bansho Tenin?
[1:58:27] <lotharrio> Soo-chi
[1:58:30] <RedAhoge> bullshit
[1:58:34] <%duffydirty> text-to-speech-kage
[1:58:46] <%torinismyname> omg, does anyone remember that money stand in Jojolion
[1:58:47] <Graxe_> Universal Pull
[1:58:47] <1C4M3R0N1> 2 face susan lol
[1:58:48] <lotharrio> Lazy ass Susan
[1:58:49] <dekkitout> The Alpha Susan
[1:58:50] <Graxe_> That's the big pull
[1:58:51] <+xx123manxx> Susan gets around
[1:58:53] <RiceeFTW> @wanocountry Bansho Tenin was the universal pull
[1:58:54] <+ggbhtg> BIG HO SUSAN
[1:58:56] <+NiSoKr> I wonder if we will see more of Susan? Kappa
[1:58:56] <+cherrypiestealer> NOTRUTOESITPOODAM
[1:58:57] <spawnzie> That Susan is a two faced bitch
[1:58:58] <0rond> Bruh naruto and sasuke surpassed madara big time
[1:58:59] <+MrRabbles> Susan gets it done
[1:59:03] <+AbnormalVoid> you think it's bad now
[1:59:04] <CaptainTenshou> @torinismyname milagro man
[1:59:05] <+AbnormalVoid> just wait
[1:59:07] <RedAhoge> Susan, Ammy, and Tsuki
[1:59:09] <+KingOfTheGeats> Tobirama was right
[1:59:09] <+Bluydee> @RedAhoge if you think the meteors were crazy you haven't seen anything yet
[1:59:09] <+cvp5127> that chakra hoe over there
[1:59:10] <Ultimatefool> Anyone remember Byakugan users LUL
[1:59:11] <%JohnAtDawn> No you need the eyes
[1:59:12] <RiceeFTW> @wanocountry literal translation is Heavenly Attraction of All Creation
[1:59:12] <+Polter_ge1st> You should rewatch the Raikage fight too
[1:59:15] <+Merhabi> do we have game audio?
[1:59:15] <1C4M3R0N1> You have to have Mangekyo but yes
[1:59:15] <+MagickBurritoh> It's gonna get worse
[1:59:16] <dundore77> you actually do need both eyes for susan
[1:59:17] <Shishi1205> rinnengan busted tho
[1:59:17] <ireliaismaiwaifu> if you go blind the stand vanishes tho
[1:59:18] <Arek_1> The power of hatred. LUL
[1:59:23] <Solidnick18> you are just blind and op
[1:59:23] <lotharrio> Plus zombies can't go blind.
[1:59:23] <Graxe_> Rinnegan is super busted
[1:59:27] <%gatorafan> @ultimatefool Boruto does :)
[1:59:29] <dekkitout> Everyone has their own gimmick, and also a stand
[1:59:30] <%torinismyname> @CaptainTenshou such a brilliant idea, Araki is amazing
[1:59:30] <+NiSoKr> It doesn't make sense
[1:59:30] <mankeyfigh> You need both eyes
[1:59:32] <%duffydirty> the fact that the sharingan can predict what immediately happens next and can see in slow motion is fuckin bullshit
[1:59:33] <+Vikken141> yes........
[1:59:36] <Arek_1> One and done.
[1:59:40] <+xx123manxx> Nope one and done
[1:59:41] <laguerrilha> the seond set you get infinite use
[1:59:42] <Nina96> just need to change it once
[1:59:42] <+killogram123> one and done
[1:59:42] <%VidulaSaix> Thats why its called Eternal Mangakyou
[1:59:42] <wanocountry> Byakugan really is the weakest of the ocular jutsu LUL
[1:59:44] <spawnzie> just once
[1:59:44] <RiceeFTW> nope once you have new set you're done
[1:59:45] <+NiSoKr> You need eyes to unlock it but you don't need eyes to use it
[1:59:47] <+Polter_ge1st> Woolie, you need a Mangekyou Sharingan to call Susan
[1:59:47] <+JacknZack27> If you steal the eye it stays forever
[1:59:47] <hassanico2> You only keep doing if you Izanagi @WoolieVersus
[1:59:47] <+ShadowArcangel> Byakugan to the other eyes: Am I a joke to you?
[1:59:48] <%BallerSwagBro9k> One and done
[1:59:48] <Shishi1205> one and done
[1:59:50] <dundore77> madara used his eyes up then took his brothers eyes and got eternal ms
[1:59:50] <+ggbhtg> One and done equals INFINTE MP
[1:59:50] <%duffydirty> no it's eternal woolie
[1:59:51] <flowdere> Bakugan is a joke
[1:59:51] <ireliaismaiwaifu> it's the brother's eyes that last forever
[1:59:54] <1C4M3R0N1> EMS
[1:59:57] <mankeyfigh> Also the Eternal Mangekyo
[1:59:57] <%Exiliator> Joink pop done
[1:59:57] <%Irridium> that's dumb bro
[1:59:57] <hassanico2> That's for IZANAGI
[1:59:58] <+GreenCMD> It's called the ETERNAL mangekyo
[1:59:58] <lotharrio> When you replace with a sibling's it's "eternal" and lasts for every.
[2:00:01] <MyNameIsRasus> Its ETERNAL
[2:00:01] <+Vikken141> nah IZangai
[2:00:02] <%VidulaSaix> Thatw as Danzo cause hes not an Uchiha
[2:00:03] <dundore77> Tobi doesn't have a brother to get Eternal
[2:00:03] <deswescappy> Byaku-what?
[2:00:04] <%JohnAtDawn> That's only Izzunagi
[2:00:06] <hassanico2> IZANAGI breaks your eyes
[2:00:06] <+AbnormalVoid> Susan
[2:00:06] <+killogram123> thats izanagi
[2:00:06] <flowdere> Sharingan does everything
[2:00:07] <spawnzie> that's for Izanagi
[2:00:07] <Dragon_Batman> That is the Izanagi
[2:00:07] <+Dre_> thats for izanagi
[2:00:07] <RiceeFTW> that's for Izanagi
[2:00:08] <Jetsfantasy> Your original eyes get burnt out. Taking someone else's doesn't degrade
[2:00:09] <justindykes16> Nope
[2:00:09] <deswescappy> who?
[2:00:13] <%duffydirty> remember byakugan?
[2:00:13] <+texflexrex> that's for the jutsus that kill the eye
[2:00:13] <+Vikken141> Its for izanagi
[2:00:15] <+GreenCMD> that's for izanagi
[2:00:15] <+RocketBarrel> Thats Izanagi
[2:00:16] <+ggbhtg> Izanagi
[2:00:16] <%JohnAtDawn> Holy fuck woolie pay attention
[2:00:16] <+avidavidity> That's normal Sharingan strain
[2:00:19] <%Exiliator> Thats a special case for izanagi
[2:00:19] <wanocountry> Can an EMS user defeat a Rinnegan user?
[2:00:21] <+killogram123> yes
[2:00:22] <lotharrio> The bullshit "you didn't win" technique is ammo-eyes.
[2:00:22] <+DAURAGON_C_MIKADO> That’s for izanagi
[2:00:24] <Shishi1205> that's if it's just your own
[2:00:26] <dundore77> not loved one. Brother
[2:00:27] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> LUL thats a weird rule
[2:00:27] <MyNameIsRasus> Thats only Izanagi
[2:00:28] <+Merhabi> its specifically your brother
[2:00:30] <Jetsfantasy> Izanagi costs an eye specifically
[2:00:31] <RiceeFTW> has to be brother
[2:00:31] <%VidulaSaix> Yes
[2:00:32] <Arek_1> That's for Izanagi. No matter how powerful the eye is, it will go blind for it.
[2:00:34] <+NiSoKr> IZanagi blinds it instantly no matter what
[2:00:38] <hassanico2> CORRECT
[2:00:38] <+ggbhtg> @woolieversus Izanagi spends an eye
[2:00:39] <spawnzie> Izanagi ALWAYS kills your eye
[2:00:41] <%Exiliator> Yes it does
[2:00:42] <mankeyfigh> Jesus the games has this man CONFUSED
[2:00:42] <justindykes16> No you can’t get eternal unless it’s a relative. Izanagi will make them permanently blind
[2:00:42] <RiceeFTW> but Izanagi spends an eye
[2:00:44] <0rond> none eternal one's do become blimd
[2:00:44] <Nina96> yes
[2:00:45] <%redrins> izanagi is the lol I'm blind jutsu
[2:00:47] <laguerrilha> Izanagi clompletly blinds it
[2:00:48] <%duffydirty> Izanagi is really rare in use anyway
[2:00:49] <Twon_From_Wakanda> Read chat PLEASE
[2:00:49] <+killogram123> izanagi makes it go blind instantly
[2:00:50] <hassanico2> Woolie got it right
[2:00:50] <RiceeFTW> that's why Danzo had tons of them
[2:00:53] <+NobleJedi> no it seals it forever
[2:00:53] <+xx123manxx> Sasuke doesnt use izanagi
[2:00:54] <Arek_1> MS overuse.
[2:00:54] <+paladinstarbuster> yes
[2:00:55] <+Merhabi> you got to steal your brothers eyes to get a jetpack
[2:00:55] <%VidulaSaix> Izanagi DOES kill the eyes, but every other technique after you get the Eternal Eyes is permanent use @WoolieVersus
[2:00:56] <Trigecko> eye math
[2:00:56] <StormKingLD> no he took those so Danzo wouldn't get them
[2:00:57] <%duffydirty> Minh please
[2:00:57] <+MagickBurritoh> If it's not eternal the special jutsu burn the eye
[2:00:59] <swansong118> Izanagi is the one who spends a eye
[2:00:59] <dundore77> izanagi requires an eye replacement eternal doesn't save it
[2:01:01] <hassanico2> EYE BULLSHIT WOOOoooo
[2:01:01] <lotharrio> Sasuke only just got his brother's eyes.
[2:01:01] <wanocountry> Sasuke didn't have Izanagi
[2:01:02] <%Exiliator> Sasuke did use Izanagi
[2:01:02] <%redrins> amaterasu slow fucks you
[2:01:02] <justindykes16> Sasuke was going blind because he didn’t have itatchi’s yet
[2:01:03] <kin_jo> Nah, overuse of the bullshit techniques like amaterasu fucks up your eyes OVER TIME
[2:01:05] <+EtheralFlameX> danzo wasn't an uchiha, and sasuke didn't have itachis eyes at the time
[2:01:08] <+ShadowArcangel> You know what? I really don't blame you for getting confused
[2:01:09] <+Polter_ge1st> That's why Danzo had the eye arm
[2:01:10] <+RocketBarrel> That's how Danzo got defeated. He used all his Izanagi eyes
[2:01:12] <tookool5678> Billy need to do homework.
[2:01:14] <spawnzie> SAsuke went blind because he used Amaterasu too much and THEN did the transfer
[2:01:14] <0rond> woolie will figure it out
[2:01:15] <+NiSoKr> Using MS blinds eyes and loved ones is one time permenant replacement
[2:01:15] <dekkitout> High level sharingan is a slow burn, Izanagi is instant
[2:01:16] <mankeyfigh> Izanagi makes an eye CLOSE FOREVER
[2:01:17] <+MagickBurritoh> amaterasu is a special ability of the eye
[2:01:17] <+JacknZack27> Sasuke was going blind before he stole his bros eyes
[2:01:21] <+GreenCMD> you need another mangekyo sharingan for ETERNAL. Izanagi kills the eyes in 1 shot. Susanoo damages not Eternal Sharingans
[2:01:26] <%duffydirty> thank you minh
[2:01:26] <+AWr00tBear> Only the izanagi can spend a Eternal MS
[2:01:26] <Arek_1> MS was overused.
[2:01:30] <Dragon_Batman> Sasuke damaged his eyes fighting so much
[2:01:31] <RedAhoge> @Bluydee yes, but I mean like you have Madara and 1st hokage doing defcon 5 with giant kaiju, meanwhile orochimaru vs 3rd hokage is just usual ninja techniques...
[2:01:34] <+Polter_ge1st> He gained Susan
[2:01:36] <chancho4tierra> IZABAGI spends your eye and if you replace with a random eye works like ammo
[2:01:37] <saiyan24675> Saskue use black Flare too much and he was going blind
[2:01:37] <+DaSkeeters> Sasuke had his eyes then itachi then goes blind
[2:01:38] <RiceeFTW> @WoolieVersus using Mangekyo makes you go blind unless you use your brother's eye; that makes it eternal mangekyo, but Izanagi ALWAYS makes you blind
[2:01:39] <%redrins> sasuke abuses amaterasu and susan
[2:01:39] <+xx123manxx> Using mangekyo kills your eyes unless youu take your fams eyes, that turns it into an ETERNAL mangekyo which makes you good forever, but izanagi will kill your eye regardless @WoolieVersus
[2:01:43] <Jetsfantasy> Danzo had an arm of eyes to spend on Izanagis
[2:01:46] <laguerrilha> Explain to Woolie waht Izanagi does
[2:01:47] <kevon_the_lord_of_slimes> sasuke was spaming blackfire and susan
[2:01:50] <%duffydirty> great fence sitter-kun
[2:01:52] <+DAURAGON_C_MIKADO> He was going blind from Susan and amaterasu
[2:01:54] <MyNameIsRasus> Not even a boss fight?
[2:01:59] <wanocountry> No wonder Danzo got an armful of them LUL
[2:02:05] <+Bluydee> @MyNameIsRasus he gets the money fight soon
[2:02:05] <lotharrio> The high level eye techs will blind you, slowly from repeated use. An eternal (transferred) eye will last forever. Unless you use Izanagi, that's instant blindness no matter what, but it's also a get out of jail free card.
[2:02:08] <Memitim> Sasuke was spamming MS
[2:02:08] <RiceeFTW> this fight is omega NOT CANON lmfao
[2:02:08] <hassanico2> Does Madara actually have more HP?
[2:02:09] <%Exiliator> Compare this to the anime LUL
[2:02:13] <%duffydirty> why waste a boss on a fence sitter?
[2:02:13] <+ggbhtg> @woolieversus he overused Ammy and Susan
[2:02:15] <Arek_1> @AWr00tBear No, remember Itachi right before he died? He went blind from MS overuse.
[2:02:17] <+fizzguy47> PHRASING
[2:02:21] <BreakersAweigh> wow good job chat for telling him to watch the anime before playing this battle

[2:03:29] <ireliaismaiwaifu> that pasta is so great it has branched into other series and shit
[2:03:30] <wanocountry> Byakugan > Mangekyo Sharingan LUL
[2:03:31] <dekkitout> Iirc Mad Lad's va played Optimus once
[2:03:39] <%LeaIsChill> He's the worst
[2:03:39] <+ggbhtg> @woolieversus Oonoki's grab was a jutsu to increase or decrease weight by touch.
[2:03:39] <muniea3> is he...... floaty?
[2:03:42] <wanocountry> You can't get blind from it
[2:03:43] <flowdere> Byakugan has no special powers
[2:03:43] <%duffydirty> im looking it up right now lol
[2:03:47] <hassanico2> "I threw a rock at him!"
[2:03:48] <+Polter_ge1st> Woolie knows how to tag in characters right?
[2:03:55] <RetroCop87> Never forget, no matter how heroic they cast this old man, he's the one who tried to kidnap baby Hinata for her eyes immediately after signing a peace treaty

[2:06:17] <RiceeFTW> susanoo is a prerequisite lmfao
[2:06:19] <%LeaIsChill> He just does it it doesn't matter what does what
[2:06:20] <wanocountry> Design wise: MS > Rinnegan > Byakugan
[2:06:20] <CozyGUNNA> ye

[2:06:23] <wbo2> i dont understand either
[2:06:23] <$megamonmon123> its a combo
[2:06:25] <mankeyfigh> Reggie is channeling Crazy Talk
[2:06:25] <+GreenCMD> they explain this in the anime, the sharingan evolves into the Rinnegan
[2:06:25] <+Merhabi> I think he uses susanoo to do jutsu better thats a thing i believe
[2:06:27] <kevon_the_lord_of_slimes> rinnegan gives powers like this
[2:06:28] <+GodDougle> @woolieversus it’s many path of six sage
[2:06:31] <CozyGUNNA> reggie is correct in that sense

[2:08:20] <%redrins> teleportation
[2:08:20] <MyNameIsRasus> Tp
[2:08:21] <RedAhoge> She is so cute....
[2:08:21] <lysdexic9542> Zetsu's a hivemind, I don't think it counts
[2:08:24] <Solidnick18> just zoop
[2:08:26] <lotharrio> Minato was a combat teleporter.
[2:08:26] <+GreenCMD> also fake madara
[2:08:27] <+paladinstarbuster> naruto is speed
[2:08:27] <+fizzguy47> He's moving super fast
[2:08:28] <optimasmaximas> BOOB SHOT Kreygasm
[2:08:28] <+NiSoKr> Yes he can
[2:08:29] <Dragon_Batman> Raikage is legit fast
[2:08:30] <+NobleJedi> Minato has both
[2:08:33] <xxxJahrio> he can
[2:08:33] <%Exiliator> Yes he can
[2:08:42] <+Merhabi> didnt that prove it when he teleported the kyubi blast?
[2:08:43] <RiceeFTW> but yes Minato is faster than Raikage
[2:08:45] <RiceeFTW> soo
[2:08:45] <+fizzguy47> Like Wesker
[2:08:45] <+killogram123> he can do long range
[2:08:46] <%Exiliator> They literally use the same jutsu
[2:08:46] <+NobleJedi> he just needs the marks placed
[2:08:47] <%torinismyname> this is a nice refresher. so much happened in the last part of the manga
[2:08:48] <RpgFoLife> He needs an anchor
[2:08:49] <MyNameIsRasus> Yes
[2:08:50] <muniea3> he he needs seals pre-set-up
[2:08:51] <keijim24> The yellow flash......
[2:08:51] <Graxe_> Flying Raijin can teleport to any place where he marked, right?
[2:08:52] <flowdere> why Minato didnt teach it to naruto?
[2:08:52] <+GreenCMD> yes
[2:08:52] <+texflexrex> minato's is just based on there being a kunai with a seal on it
[2:08:52] <%VidulaSaix> If the KLunai is there yes
[2:08:53] <%JohnAtDawn> He did it IN THIS GAME
[2:08:53] <%Exiliator> those three guys
[2:08:55] <$megamonmon123> minato is nightcrawler
[2:08:55] <+NiSoKr> Minato has to set up seals
[2:08:55] <Sapphire_Breeze> yes
[2:08:56] <CozyGUNNA> best fight up
[2:08:56] <%Kitafin> he just has to lock onto someone's chakra
[2:08:56] <lotharrio> Minato can teleport anyway he wants, as long as he uses his seals.
[2:08:56] <Dragon_Batman> He teleports to what has the seal that allows him
[2:08:57] <%VidulaSaix> He needs the seal to teleport to
[2:08:59] <RiceeFTW> he needs the seal
[2:08:59] <+killogram123> he just needs the symbol on the other side
[2:08:59] <Ultimatefool> HOW DO YOU SURVIVE THAT
[2:09:02] <laguerrilha> on the anime the old man is a bloody mess
[2:09:03] <waffleandman> no ones ever really gone
[2:09:03] <spawnzie> he would need a kunai
[2:09:04] <Shishi1205> he needs the kunai
[2:09:04] <+GreenCMD> he did it literally in the game woolie
[2:09:08] <mankeyfigh> Maybeee
[2:09:09] <aracon_> lmfao casually ate 2 meteors to the face
[2:09:09] <wanocountry> Imma be real chat, Mei is hotter than Tsunade
[2:09:11] <hassanico2> Happy transition Sharingan
[2:09:12] <chancho4tierra> Minato uses his checkpoints
[2:09:14] <Sapphire_Breeze> kunai or touch the room inside
[2:09:15] <justindykes16> Minato can teleport to the points on his knives. He has to have a warp point
[2:09:16] <0rond> minato's secret is that he isn't actually fast at all, he is just super good at sealing techniques. he can teleport to any place that has his seal
[2:09:19] <+NiSoKr> Minato can go where ever his seals are no matter what
[2:09:20] <+DaSkeeters> Minto is fast and teleports using seals
[2:09:20] <BreakersAweigh> if a kunai is in the room he can teleport there
[2:09:20] <1C4M3R0N1> Tsunade is not that hot
[2:09:22] <fruit_pie_the_magician> He doesn't need a kunai, he just needs the seal
[2:09:22] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Gave you a bigger dick
[2:09:25] <flowdere> Minato is like savepoint user
[2:09:28] <Nekros4442> The Kunai has the mark
[2:09:30] <+JacknZack27> Is minato running really fast or teleporting
[2:09:33] <mankeymania> it's a summoning jutsu
[2:09:33] <dekkitout> So it's an ender pearl
[2:09:34] <Dragon_Batman> The Kunai has the seal that allows one to teleport
[2:09:35] <%VidulaSaix> Teleporting
[2:09:35] <chancho4tierra> the kunai is a checkpoin
[2:09:35] <1C4M3R0N1> Throwing to destination
[2:09:36] <+WoodTheCaveman> Tags on the kunai
[2:09:36] <+NobleJedi> yes
[2:09:38] <Nekros4442> and Minato can place other Marks as well
[2:09:38] <RiceeFTW> @JacknZack27 both
[2:09:38] <Sol_Install> yes
[2:09:38] <%VidulaSaix> Yes, its Noctis
[2:09:39] <RedAhoge> Madara is blind atm y'know
[2:09:39] <Malikwest11> he can use seals too
[2:09:41] <+CarlosEoM> he's summoning himself to the kunai
[2:09:42] <MyNameIsRasus> Yes
[2:09:45] <Sapphire_Breeze> @JacknZack27 he does both
[2:09:45] <alastorkunn> its an ender pearl
[2:09:46] <1C4M3R0N1> He did the cool Tobi thing remember
[2:09:47] <+ggbhtg> @woolieversus Minato literally marks a warp point
[2:09:50] <aracon_> uh oh naruto has to take a shit

[2:09:53] <TwinBat> NOOB SAIBOT
[2:09:53] <hassanico2> NInetails: "OH SHIT OH SHIT"
[2:09:56] <lotharrio> He teleports to the kunai. So if the kunai was in the locked room, on the other side of the planet, he could still teleport there.
[2:10:03] <wanocountry> Minato's kunai looks sick af first time I saw it
[2:10:03] <Arek_1> Caught that? The Sharingan can evolve into the Rinnegan.
[2:10:04] <%duffydirty> daddys callin
[2:10:06] <fruit_pie_the_magician> And so he can choose to teleport to any seal he wants, it's a dimensional jutsu like a bunch of the second hokage's shit

[2:19:02] <+ggbhtg> @woolieversus His Shadow Clones ALWAYS split up chakra btw
[2:19:03] <%duffydirty> like boy if you don't send out a clone that doesn't disappear to hang out with your son
[2:19:05] <Memitim> he has a voice changer in his mask Kappa
[2:19:06] <+miyoles> Rock Lee is getting weaker and weaker with all this power scaling
[2:19:08] <laguerrilha> Madara can have a twin brother
[2:19:13] <RedAhoge> Madara and MADARA Kappa
[2:19:15] <CozyGUNNA> Kreygasm
[2:19:16] <lotharrio> Yo Woolie... maybe the OTHER Madara is also a clone.

[2:19:40] <mankeyfigh> The Naruto Everywhere System
[2:19:40] <jase__x> yes

[2:19:41] <%Irridium> RISE UP NINJA GAMERS
[2:19:44] <+killogram123> yes he could
[2:19:44] <Sahakitt> chat i don't wanna spoil so, do they or woolie know about what happen next?
[2:19:44] <%Exiliator> Turns it he was actually Madora, just a big misunderstanding
[2:19:45] <tookool5678> yes
[2:19:46] <+number_1_ninja> Naruto is just soloing the war
[2:19:47] <dekkitout> Basically
[2:19:48] <+GreenCMD> yes
[2:19:48] <lysdexic9542> oops all Madaras

[2:19:51] <%duffydirty> yea
[2:19:51] <Ultimatefool> Oh God there's a Naruto behind you Woolie! Look out!
[2:19:51] <+MagickBurritoh> No
[2:19:52] <%LeaIsChill> Naruto is an army himself
[2:19:54] <+captain_history> I like both Madara and Tobi really, both have cool moves
[2:19:54] <+kyh9> Ey, Rock Lee
[2:19:56] <aracon_> nah naruto is too strong now
[2:19:57] <RiceeFTW> no not anymore he doesn't need to be sitting still LMAO now he has cheat mode
[2:19:57] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @wanocountry yup
[2:19:57] <%duffydirty> naruto is actually an old man
[2:19:58] <@Solidus_113> THOT
[2:19:58] <Leiru8> BOOO
[2:19:59] <+NiSoKr> He still has to sit still
[2:19:59] <muniea3> he always has a few in reserve
[2:20:00] <%duffydirty> on an island
[2:20:01] <aracon_> can do it while running
[2:20:01] <+MagickBurritoh> A clone can get him the sage mode for him
[2:20:02] <Dragon_Batman> There is this whole thing that people can't fight because the Zetsu is posing as their comrades and NAruto is the only one to tell who is real
[2:20:07] <+JacknZack27> Or another shadow clone is sitting steal
[2:20:07] <fruit_pie_the_magician> No, ONE OF HIS CLONES can be off doing sage sitting
[2:20:08] <kevon_the_lord_of_slimes> he still has to be still
[2:20:09] <BreakersAweigh> naruto you don't need to save her
[2:20:10] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Boo go back to the 5 Kage
[2:20:12] <alastorkunn> muda woman
[2:20:13] <RedAhoge> eating potato chips
[2:20:13] <+kyh9> HEY
[2:20:15] <+kyh9> ITS THE GUY
[2:20:15] <lotharrio> He doesn't need to be sitting still anymore. The higher level sage techniques let him move around and gather sage chakra.
[2:20:16] <Zebroneath> He got mutliple power ups at once
[2:20:16] <%LeaIsChill> DAIJOUBU
[2:20:16] <jase__x> He does know what his clone is doing
[2:20:20] <wanocountry> Rock Lee and Neji should've fought a real Akatsuki member just like Team Shikamaru
[2:20:22] <aracon_> naruto hardocre cheating
[2:20:27] <aracon_> hardcore*
[2:20:29] <+MagickBurritoh> Naruto is literally glowing
[2:20:30] <+kyh9> They don't care
[2:20:31] <Solidnick18> i'm fucking OP
[2:20:32] <Mirakei> The NES Naruto Every System
[2:20:32] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> YEAH BUT IM THE MAIN CHARACTER
[2:20:32] <laguerrilha> no
[2:20:35] <NinjaGentleman> why have a army at this point
[2:20:35] <RiceeFTW> he's too powerful to care tbh
[2:20:35] <jase__x> nope
[2:20:36] <+kyh9> No
[2:20:36] <%VidulaSaix> No?
[2:20:36] <+texflexrex> not without sharingan
[2:20:37] <+CarlosEoM> no
[2:20:37] <+GreenCMD> Yeah he could do that but he's not smart enough for that
[2:20:39] <+killogram123> no
[2:20:39] <%duffydirty> he learns what his clones do when they come back i think
[2:20:39] <+ggbhtg> @woolieversus The Sage E Tanks were in ANOTHER DIMENSION in the Pain fight
[2:20:40] <+paladinstarbuster> no
[2:20:41] <1C4M3R0N1> No
[2:20:41] <%JohnAtDawn> How would they?
[2:20:43] <+iM_Pnut> Vergil could only make one clone Kappa
[2:20:43] <%VidulaSaix> Thats kinda the point of shadow clone woolie
[2:20:44] <+NiSoKr> No shadows clones are perfect
[2:20:44] <+xx123manxx> or it would be useless
[2:20:46] <NinjaGentleman> no
[2:20:46] <+kyh9> normal clones, yes, but not Shadow Clones
[2:20:47] <+Dre_> not without a sharingan
[2:20:47] <1C4M3R0N1> That's never been a thing
[2:20:47] <caol2017> that's the thing for shadow clones
[2:20:47] <Sapphire_Breeze> that's the point
[2:20:48] <+GreenCMD> not really
[2:20:48] <dolphinbj> Shadow clones are more OP than other clones
[2:20:49] <mankeyfigh> No
[2:20:49] <+texflexrex> the sharingan or byakugan can tell
[2:20:50] <Jetsfantasy> He's using a forbidden clone tech since the start
[2:20:50] <+NobleJedi> shadow clones are pretty op
[2:20:51] <+paladinstarbuster> other wise whats the point
[2:20:52] <alexandrecau> even neiji couln't
[2:20:53] <%duffydirty> he uses shadow clones so they cant tell
[2:20:54] <+MagickBurritoh> Shadow clones are special type of clones too
[2:20:55] <Ianrazz> Yes Byakugan can tell
[2:20:56] <wanocountry> Minh: N O LUL
[2:20:58] <Dragon_Batman> That is why it's forbidden technically
[2:20:58] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Naruto makes actual copies
[2:21:00] <%duffydirty> shadow clones are forbidden because of this
[2:21:00] <flowdere> ninja run
[2:21:01] <ireliaismaiwaifu> not really
[2:21:02] <RiceeFTW> FINAL CHAPTER
[2:21:04] <laguerrilha> yep
[2:21:04] <mankeyfigh> That’s the point of shadow clones
[2:21:05] <Solidnick18> yep
[2:21:05] <+Vikken141> Its crazy that the rest of the series takes place in this forest,it just gets turned into wasteland
[2:21:07] <CozyGUNNA> shut up dont think about it
[2:21:08] <%BallerSwagBro9k> ITS GO TIME
[2:21:09] <+NobleJedi> it's just that Naruto was just bad at fighting
[2:21:11] <+kyh9> SHOW ME GAI VS TOBI
[2:21:13] <NinjaGentleman> honestly what is a regular clone at this point?
[2:21:16] <wanocountry> Last Level
[2:21:17] <+kyh9> SHOW ME NUNCHUKS
[2:21:18] <@Solidus_113> remember, Naruto learned the forbidden shadow clones from the scroll @WoolieVersus
[2:21:19] <RedAhoge> People can tell based on how reckless they are compared to how they usually are
[2:21:20] <%BallerSwagBro9k> ONLY BIG MONEY NOW
[2:21:20] <+NiSoKr> Sharingan/Byakugan used to be able to see it but it got retconned
[2:21:21] <RiceeFTW> give us GUY SENSEI
[2:21:21] <Arek_1> No dojutsu can tell Shadow Clone from user.
[2:21:22] <%VidulaSaix> YEYEYE
[2:21:24] <%JohnAtDawn> @kyh9 Not in this game
[2:21:25] <0rond> you need sharingan or byakugan to tell, and shadow clones are extra difficult to tell
[2:21:27] <%Youknowwhyimhere008> atpShh
[2:21:28] <1C4M3R0N1> YES
[2:21:29] <CozyGUNNA> OKAY BIG MONEY CC2 NOW
[2:21:31] <caol2017> other types of clones are weak sauce compared to shadows
[2:21:31] <1C4M3R0N1> LETS GO

[2:22:12] <Personified134> ?
[2:22:13] <caol2017> She steps on you
[2:22:13] <RedAhoge> who Mizukage?
[2:22:13] <ireliaismaiwaifu> tsunade could win this fight if she just smashed madara between her breasts, the pressure is too much
[2:22:14] <lotharrio> Two mages, a ranged support and two brawlers.
[2:22:16] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @duffydirty A highly noble cause
[2:22:16] <wanocountry> Lava and steam
[2:22:17] <Kiraklene> Lava

[2:22:49] <%JohnAtDawn> He could break out
[2:22:49] <saiyan24675> Okay Ulquorria
[2:22:50] <+kyh9> Normal Kage cheating: putting in a cheat code MAdara Cheating: changing the binary machine code

[2:53:57] <jase__x> kill the one that kills your framerate
[2:53:57] <wanocountry> Kill the Mizukage asap
[2:53:57] <%Kitafin> They got resealed in them upon ressurection
[2:53:58] <Solidnick18> i wish i had finished this bit
[2:53:59] <%gatorafan> Stable frame rate is for BABIES who play on Hero DansGame
[2:54:01] <+xx123manxx> gotta take out the ranged ads
[2:54:02] <+Vikken141> Tobi has to give it
[2:54:04] <+texflexrex> more like the reanimation just fakes the eyes and powers, but the swords are real things
[2:54:04] <0rond> @woolieversus all the beasts were in tobi's possession, he re sealed them in the jinchuriki
[2:54:05] <lunacys_straightjacket> he probably re sealed them
[2:54:07] <+iM_Pnut> Did Woolz forget Tobi had the beasts? for like all of Shippuden?
[2:54:07] <hassanico2> @Vikken141 What about Kin/Gintaku?
[2:54:08] <Memitim> Tobi stuffed them back in, don't think it's explained in the game
[2:54:08] <RedAhoge> is the red guy
[2:54:12] <+Dre_> remember your items woolie
[2:54:12] <%redrins> the beasts were taken by the statue, there is no returning it to previous jinchuuriki
[2:54:19] <RedAhoge> she was cool
[2:54:20] <+colezone_> I never noticed that the jinchuriki of Son Goku is Roushi. can't tell if DB reference or I'm uncultured
[2:54:20] <Kiraklene> Wai-Fuu <3 <3 <3
[2:54:20] <%VidulaSaix> Fuu VoHiYo
[2:54:20] <laguerrilha> yeah it was sad
[2:54:22] <Dragon_Batman> @WoolieVersus There is an episode called Secrets of the Reanimation Jutsu , they explain some stuff and the anime explains the beast thing a bit more
[2:54:25] <laguerrilha> We see it
[2:54:27] <wanocountry> Utakata also has a filler arc
[2:54:28] <Malikwest11> as long as you have tail beast chakra you ca
[2:54:28] <+Vikken141> They're chakra was not sealed away
[2:54:29] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Didn't all the Jinjuriki have an arc?
[2:54:29] <%redrins> except from this jutsu
[2:54:29] <Ultzerostar00> The Bubble guy had an arc too
[2:54:33] <Sol_Install> the seven tail and the six tail had their own arc
[2:54:35] <Morning_Asakura> this is a mess
[2:54:41] <+ggbhtg> @woolieversus the 6th jinchu had an arc too
[2:54:41] <lotharrio> You know how Gaara can still use sand techniques despite no longer having Shukaku? Jinchuuriki are influenced by the tail beast chakra that's inside of them.
[2:54:42] <lysdexic9542> We see Hidan and Kakuzu get her at the end
[2:54:43] <xxxJahrio> just do hero...
[2:54:44] <laguerrilha> bubble guy had an arc and died at the end
[2:54:45] <%BallerSwagBro9k> THEY ALL HAD ARCS
[2:54:45] <%Irridium> this is great
[2:54:46] <TheArpeggiator> she got found by the zombie boys
[2:54:46] <RedAhoge> magenta man
[2:54:51] <$megamonmon123> this is gonna be a fun fight
[2:54:57] <+Bluydee> the filler arc Fuu appeared in is Gaara at the Chuunin Exams 2
[2:54:57] <lotharrio> Plus they slapped the tailed beasts back into them, I think.
[2:54:57] <austinj24> bubble guy had two I thought
[2:55:00] <+Vivaciousx3> or PC
[2:55:03] <jase__x> why are you playing the ps3 version man
[2:55:04] <+NiSoKr> That's a dude

[2:55:08] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YUP PC VERSION IS GOOD TOO
[2:55:08] <+kaiju7544> Each one of these Jinchuriki had a two on one fight against pairs of the akatsuki.
[2:55:09] <%JohnAtDawn> That's a man woolie

[2:55:49] <+kdallas_> 2
[2:55:51] <Arek_1> Until this point in the manga and anime, Utakata the Six Tails was filler.

[2:56:11] <Ultzerostar00> The side has a break inbetween the fights
[2:56:12] <Kiraklene> Purple is zoning
[2:56:22] <Jetsfantasy> Lava is high priority
[2:56:23] <wanocountry> Utakata > Caesar LUL
[2:56:27] <1C4M3R0N1> Attack the zoner

[3:03:20] <%BallerSwagBro9k> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[3:03:26] <bethore> @WoolieVersus You pick which one you want for the battle. The legend and hero decision only level up the loadouts
[3:03:26] <hassanico2> Would Woolie actually benefit from Legend items chat?
[3:03:27] <wanocountry> NA reading
[3:03:28] <+ggbhtg> @woolieversus You could go back to Hero missions to level your Hero loadout

[4:06:48] <laguerrilha> Stealth nuke!
[4:06:49] <+Slybluedemon> Don't we get 2 more forms?
[4:06:51] <+paladinstarbuster> Kaiju were in the FIRST EPISODE WOOLIE
[4:06:53] <R3c0n31> Think of DBZ number of transformation but ninja logic
[4:06:55] <austin9568> >Ninja Gaiden
[4:06:58] <%duffydirty> you havent seen shit woolie
[4:06:58] <%JohnAtDawn> That's not what legends about ninjas were really like dumbass
[4:06:59] <+Superbro64> strider?
[4:06:59] <%OkamiDude15> sekiro is NOT a ninja
[4:06:59] <laguerrilha> Sekiro is a ninja
[4:06:59] <+ggbhtg> Tsushima
[4:07:00] <hassanico2> "Seks"
[4:07:01] <+KingOfTheGeats> they're basically Wizards at this point
[4:07:01] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Ninja Gaiden is pretty ridiculous too Woolie
[4:07:02] <muniea3> this is still only half the 9 tails
[4:07:02] <xxxJahrio> its a manga about magic ninjas, since when was it realistic???
[4:07:03] <+TopTieramisu> KAGE
[4:07:03] <+croxeye> NUNS 3: "Last Battle!" NUNS 4: "am i a joke to you?"
[4:07:03] <+kewlmyc> Let me guess, his dad gets revived and gives him the other half of Kurama and that's the last powerup
[4:07:05] <Kiraklene> Sekiro is not a ninja
[4:07:05] <mar_krow> Not even the end we got buroto
[4:07:06] <+xx123manxx> Sekiro is a shinobi
[4:07:06] <Sol_Install> you all the ninjas that have giants demons animals and other shit?
[4:07:07] <+Cloudy_TV> KAGE
[4:07:07] <Zeemod155> Your definition of "NINJA" are too miniscule
[4:07:08] <%UrielCobalt> Ninja gaiden is based off post Kabuki Ninja
[4:07:09] <+xx123manxx> close enough
[4:07:09] <+Pulsin> strider?
[4:07:10] <+jazzcrasher> We are NINJA WIZARDS Woolie
[4:07:10] <aracon_> Ninjas that bust out big fuck off monsters when they get caught
[4:07:10] <Sokumotanaka> Ninja gaiden has some pretty magical shit happen in it
[4:07:11] <hassanico2> KAGE MARU WORKS FOr SEga!
[4:07:11] <mar_krow> Game yet
[4:07:11] <BreakersAweigh> there's another game chat thats barely even a spoiler
[4:07:12] <+ggbhtg> Ghosts of Tsushima
[4:07:14] <Ultzerostar00> Does Ibuki count?
[4:07:14] <+Bluydee> if he's going crazy over this imagine when he sees the prologue of NUNS 4
[4:07:14] <1C4M3R0N1> Kyuubi was in episode 1 though
[4:07:15] <RedAhoge> Bright neon orange entirety
[4:07:15] <phatmac16> Ninja scroll
[4:07:15] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> FAIRY TAIL
[4:07:17] <%duffydirty> sekiro isnt even a video game to woolie, minh cmon you know that
[4:07:18] <jetswerve> Doesn't Ninja Gaiden have giant monsters as well?
[4:07:20] <Anthony0192> Ninja blade
[4:07:21] <+ShadowArcangel> LUL
[4:07:22] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Scorpion from MK
[4:07:23] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> I love this episode of Fairy Tail
[4:07:24] <deafmelone> Yoshimitsu
[4:07:25] <%UrielCobalt> Read GAllant Jiraiya, Woolie
[4:07:26] <jetswerve> At least, 3D Ninja Gaiden
[4:07:26] <CozyGUNNA> taki from SC
[4:07:33] <catrequiem> Ah shit here we go again
[4:07:36] <CozyGUNNA> ibuki from SF
[4:07:36] <xeros720> you big
[4:07:37] <austin9568> @Jetsfantasy there's a giant werewolf
[4:07:38] <%Exiliator> The camera is still so low
[4:07:39] <+TopTieramisu> woolie won't even finish GOTY BibleThump
[4:07:39] <mar_krow> Do we get a boruto game yet
[4:07:39] <+croxeye> that camera looks awful tho
[4:07:42] <lamekidthagawd> in ninja gaiden you fight multiple demon Kaiju
[4:07:44] <Monkeyweed21> Goemon loved throwing nukes
[4:07:47] <Sedrelic> have you played kage woolie? i think not
[4:07:50] <%UrielCobalt> Ninja were conceived in Japanese folklore, the real ones played on that
[4:07:50] <aracon_> I'll admit this, the finishers you do on these guys is pretty sick
[4:07:51] <laguerrilha> This was a green forest before LUL
[4:08:00] <+ShadowArcangel> Scare the chakra out of him..
[4:08:02] <alexandrecau> you alreay took them when they were two
[4:08:02] <tookool5678> use your super
[4:08:06] <Ultimatefool> Now you do less damage than before???
[4:08:10] <+dmtjinni> MACHA WAR ZONE
[4:08:12] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> This fight also sucks. Camera is awful and they have super armor out the ass
[4:08:17] <RedAhoge> Where is 8 tails actually
[4:08:18] <1C4M3R0N1> Chakra dash exists woolie
[4:08:20] <%duffydirty> use your demon wind shuriken
[4:08:22] <R3c0n31> What was that move? he lost a full bar
[4:08:23] <Sapphire_Breeze> ninjas man
[4:08:23] <%VidulaSaix> No cuase this is 50%
[4:08:28] <BreakersAweigh> yep
[4:08:28] <laguerrilha> yeah
[4:08:29] <+texflexrex> yup
[4:08:31] <Mr_Rakjo> yup
[4:08:33] <R3c0n31> yup
[4:08:33] <Kiraklene> 50% Woolie 50 PERCENT
[4:08:33] <RedAhoge> mmmmm 25 technically
[4:08:34] <%Exiliator> Yes
[4:08:38] <tookool5678> just spam super to win.
[4:08:41] <+TopTieramisu> FUR UP
[4:08:43] <mar_krow> Correct
[4:08:45] <Sol_Install> fuck that kitty!
[4:08:50] <1C4M3R0N1> Super
[4:08:57] <%duffydirty> wet?
[4:08:59] <+dmtjinni> anime.......
[4:09:00] <Arek_1> Even so, a Tailed Beast is stronger when in tune with its host.
[4:09:01] <0rond> it's not the kyuubi, this is a Chakra construct like susanoo
[4:09:01] <8_Bit_Badger> Has any anime character ever actually gone 100%? Because they always say they are but then they get some new upgrade 1 season later
[4:09:07] <hassanico2> Ultimately this is just Naruto inside a Chakra Mecha
[4:09:12] <%JohnAtDawn> No, this is still stronger than that. Kinda. Tailed Beasts are stronger with jinchuriki.
[4:09:13] <dolphinbj> Jinchuuriki fusion>Base tailed beast though, it evens out
[4:09:14] <%duffydirty> no
[4:09:14] <+DK_MisterFly> Naruto never gets Fur Kuruma and I never understood why
[4:09:16] <alexandrecau> where is one tail again?
[4:09:17] <%VidulaSaix> Yeah this is literally just a chakra mecha
[4:09:19] <+TopTieramisu> @8_Bit_Badger gai
[4:09:22] <1C4M3R0N1> Woolie actually pay attention to the fight
[4:09:25] <+xx123manxx> Because yellow @DK_MisterFly
[4:09:28] <Dragon_Batman> Well in terms of tails the higher one does have more chakra
[4:09:30] <0rond> it's not glowing with seals, it's a Chakra construct
[4:09:31] <tookool5678> use your super move
[4:09:33] <%UrielCobalt> Togoro went 100%, but he could also go over 100%
[4:09:35] <Sokumotanaka> woolie use Triangle circle
[4:09:36] <+dmtjinni> Naruto is for r*tards...
[4:09:37] <+paladinstarbuster> One tail is sealled
[4:09:38] <%JohnAtDawn> One Tail wasn't allowed at the party.
[4:09:45] <xeros720> yeah, woolie is getting wrekt
[4:09:47] <+ggbhtg> @woolieversus triangle super bro
[4:09:49] <RedAhoge> Daigo Block it
[4:09:49] <laguerrilha> went to the bathroom
[4:09:49] <mar_krow> 150%
[4:09:50] <+dj_orpheus> @DK_MisterFly he probably didnt want to draw fur so he made an easier design to draw
[4:09:53] <+paladinstarbuster> usesuper
[4:09:56] <1C4M3R0N1> Woolie isn't trying thats why
[4:10:00] <detritus25> 100% went out the window after Super Saiyan 3. Dragon ball single handedly destroyed power levels lol.

[4:14:17] <tookool5678> use your super move.
[4:14:20] <AMstone776> what is this blocking?
[4:14:22] <alephalpha> charge block jutsu repeat
[4:14:22] <8_Bit_Badger> If it works it works
[4:14:22] <%OkamiDude15> woolie finally learned to drop his shield but at what cost
[4:14:27] <Personified134> ninja battles!
[4:14:27] <Make_me_mad> Gotta make sure he's safe in the enemy cooldowns.
[4:14:33] <12345wery> Oh wait where does this game end its story?
[4:14:34] <1C4M3R0N1> My gosh
[4:14:35] <Sp3ctre48> The half of Kurama thing is pretty stupid though
[4:14:41] <Morning_Asakura> block charge jutsu
[4:14:45] <RedAhoge> @flowdere technically 49 percent with the amount of 9 tails chakra that gets shared around
[4:14:49] <Morning_Asakura> three tools to success
[4:14:49] <mar_krow> Gotta stay focus Kyle
[4:14:50] <+dracgeon> At least this final bit is much easier
[4:14:53] <majindusto> Ninja Kaiju Battle
[4:14:55] <1C4M3R0N1> How did he beat Dark Souls lol
[4:14:56] <12345wery> AKA is this games ending off manga
[4:14:57] <TalisKanju> Is that Minh T. Fresh?!
[4:14:59] <+furiousfurioso> oh my god
[4:15:06] <hassanico2> @1C4M3R0N1 Dark Souls was welll made
[4:15:10] <+ggbhtg> can you not charge or something?
[4:15:18] <xxxJahrio> you can
[4:15:20] <+xx123manxx> FailFish
[4:15:20] <RedAhoge> this is so fking lame for a kaiju fighr
[4:15:26] <AMstone776> nah this game ends before the face reveal.
[4:15:31] <+dracgeon> But you have to stand still to charge
[4:15:32] <1C4M3R0N1> The concept is the same dodge or block the attacks. Hit and dont get hit
[4:15:32] <catrequiem> EPIC
[4:15:37] <+TopTieramisu> it doesn't help that they don't move like kaiju
[4:15:38] <RedAhoge> @AMstone776 IKR!
[4:15:40] <mar_krow> Just dodge
[4:15:46] <wanocountry> !Uptime
[4:15:47] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 4 hours and 15 minutes
[4:15:48] <mar_krow> Lol
[4:15:51] <RedAhoge> Daigo Parry
[4:15:51] <alephalpha> it is really weird that your last minute powerup doesn't just murder the things that were ruining you before
[4:15:52] <chancho4tierra> use the giant energy ball where they are charging
[4:15:53] <+JacknZack27> Cant he change chakra?
[4:15:56] <wanocountry> Woolie is still playing? LUL
[4:15:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> !uptime
[4:16:07] <Marakami_Sadaneo> the real final battle for this game is way better.
[4:16:11] <AMstone776> and makes a non canon ending due to CC2 not knowing if they were going to make another game.
[4:16:12] <+furiousfurioso> @alephalpha well it does but he's refusing to use the super move
[4:16:17] <Marakami_Sadaneo> but also really hard
[4:16:26] <RedAhoge> this beast is from the waterfall village right?
[4:16:27] <wanocountry> Will Woolie play the DLC today?
[4:16:33] <+rick_dood> kurma super bomb is op
[4:16:33] <+dracgeon> The super takes a long time
[4:16:33] <Morning_Asakura> no
[4:16:37] <1C4M3R0N1> DLC is the final battle
[4:16:40] <DingoEgret13> Which one is this? 4?
[4:16:41] <0rond> the non canon ending is because the wasn't a Canon ending, especially in the anime
[4:16:42] <Dragon_Batman> Probably not today I would think
[4:16:47] <coldfire0007> Does jutsu interrupt their charges?
[4:16:49] <%OkamiDude15> @DingoEgret13 this is 3
[4:16:51] <+ggbhtg> they been going like 4 hours
[4:16:52] <Morning_Asakura> no way he gets to it
[4:16:52] <%VidulaSaix> yes
[4:16:53] <+xx123manxx> NUNS3
[4:16:54] <AMstone776> no, the DLC takes a while to get to.

[4:39:08] <+Extrallent> Just play 4 I think.
[4:39:08] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1204820081542402050?s=19
[4:39:09] <+killogram123> watch 5 kage vs madara
[4:39:09] <%jake_protagonist> yes watch them
[4:39:10] <Morning_Asakura> actually
[4:39:10] <Arek_1> DLC then drop Storm 3.
[4:39:14] <+ggbhtg> @woolieversus 4 game doesnt recap aside much
[4:39:15] <mar_krow> Dlc
[4:39:16] <+medinaj1990> five kaga vs madara don't watch naruto vs tobi
[4:39:16] <+Bluydee> NUNS 4 is way better than Storm 3
[4:39:18] <TheSaltminer> where the fuck was Anko Mitarashi
[4:39:21] <AMstone776> @woolieversus the DLC fight is not in NUNS4. for fights just go until Naruto vs Tobimadara
[4:39:21] <thexiiilightning> For example. Guy and Kakashi fought the beasts with Naruto and Bee
[4:39:21] <tacostarvedbeast> hoe cage vs modeara
[4:39:23] <+kazekyou> Obito was Vic??
[4:39:23] <tookool5678> DLC is real ending.
[4:39:25] <%CommanderSqueaks> It ignores that these fights ever happened.
[4:39:25] <+Slybluedemon> @WoolieVersus Storm 4 starts with this battle
[4:39:26] <Pyrrhus90> watch 5 kage vs madara
[4:39:27] <%Exiliator> It starts in a HYPE manner
[4:39:27] <Dragon_Batman> I think 5 kage kinda goes more right than this
[4:39:28] <1C4M3R0N1> Just go to the 4th game
[4:39:28] <+ggbhtg> what did I...
[4:39:28] <%redrins> in the most middle of the action moment
[4:39:30] <laguerrilha> NUNS 4 they remake the fight and get the real ending
[4:39:31] <+GreenCMD> The only crossover between stuff is the very last fight
[4:39:36] <%VidulaSaix> @WoolieVersus Watch 5 Kage vs Madara, then the 4th game starts with the group meeting up with Tobi like the ending started to do ehre
[4:39:36] <hassanico2> @TheSaltminer she was part of the first team tha got wiped out
[4:39:41] <+Dre_> the 4 game starts right into the war it wastes no time
[4:39:42] <Memitim> DLC is the real ending iirc
[4:39:43] <$megamonmon123> 4th game just continues from the animd
[4:39:45] <+ShadowArcangel> Deidara's sister is so cool
[4:39:47] <its_sinny> kage vs madara totally different outcome
[4:39:50] <%duffydirty> the fence sitter sitting on shoulders now
[4:39:50] <Arek_1> @WoolieVersus DLC then drop Storm 3.
[4:39:50] <tacostarvedbeast> then the wacky theme of naruto starts
[4:39:54] <CozyGUNNA> DLC is true ending
[4:39:55] <+Bluydee> 4th game starts off after DLC
[4:39:55] <1C4M3R0N1> DLC shows ending
[4:39:59] <+ggbhtg> @woolieversus Naruto vs Tobi is redone
[4:40:03] <wendigo172> 4 doesn’t cover all of Naruto vs Tobi. Just the end
[4:40:04] <NinjaGentleman> DLC is true ending
[4:40:06] <mar_krow> U will know woolie
[4:40:08] <Monkeyweed21> NUNS 4 starts right after beating all the tailed beasts
[4:40:08] <Dragon_Batman> I would say watch up till the start of Madaras intro
[4:40:13] <its_sinny> kage vs madara
[4:40:15] <Memitim> Storm 3 was caught up with the manga I believe
[4:40:15] <mar_krow> Or u can play filler
[4:40:18] <wanocountry> HxH and Berserk will never get a proper ending :(
[4:40:19] <%IMDRanged> IMDRanged subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! Sup, Chewie

[4:40:37] <CEGold> CEGold subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[4:40:39] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> LUL
[4:40:41] <Dragon_Batman> There wasn't much of a fight
[4:40:45] <mar_krow> Nuns is the best game
[4:40:47] <%VidulaSaix> They're mostly non characters
[4:40:48] <%redrins> 5 kage vs madara and wtv the dlc shows you, that's what you gotta watch
[4:40:50] <1C4M3R0N1> Wasn't much
[4:40:51] <+medinaj1990> woolie only knows gif level knowledge of the end of naruto
[4:40:53] <+killogram123> they were mostly zombies
[4:40:53] <R3c0n31> Woolie is gonna be disspointed
[4:40:55] <%Exiliator> They dont really do much
[4:40:58] <+Deadbulky> STORM 4 IS HYPE
[4:41:00] <%ultrasparkseid> not much there my gee
[4:41:03] <%VidulaSaix> They are
[4:41:06] <mankeyfigh> @wanocountry Doesn’t Berserk still get new chapters and isn’t constantly on hiatus like HxH?
[4:41:08] <+xx123manxx> I'll see you guys in 3 years for storm 4
[4:41:09] <1C4M3R0N1> Storm 3 has more
[4:41:09] <+GreenCMD> The tobi fight is actually worth seeing
[4:41:10] <+medinaj1990> the big stuff you can't have not heard
[4:41:13] <+DK_MisterFly> fair enough
[4:41:15] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> This credits is very Kingdom Hearts 1
[4:41:15] <SeruraRenge> The other jinchuriki are surprisingly shallow characters
[4:41:16] <wanocountry> Watch the Jinchuriki fillers LUL
[4:41:17] <AMstone776> Yo you get like nothing for the other dudes.

[4:42:02] <+medinaj1990> kurama total tsundere
[4:42:04] <+Vivaciousx3> well the tailed beasts were shown off earlier in the series, but we skipped all of that
[4:42:04] <laguerrilha> Anything before Madara is safe to watch
[4:42:05] <%redrins> nine tailed fuckers Kappa
[4:42:12] <Zeemod155> Akat Sookie
[4:42:12] <+Deadbulky> So wen storm 4

[4:46:57] <+kyh9> Shippuden OP 13 is best
[4:46:58] <pochecito> DLC is canon tho
[4:47:00] <lysdexic9542> Storm 4 coming 2024
[4:47:06] <NinjaGentleman> DLC is like 1 fight though
[4:47:08] <%VidulaSaix> Yep
[4:47:08] <@Solidus_113> yes
[4:47:09] <mankeyfigh> DLC NEXT WEEK
[4:47:11] <%redrins> yes
[4:47:13] <%VidulaSaix> Cause they didnt know they'd get to make 4
[4:47:14] <0rond> The dlc is 100% CANON
[4:47:17] <foiledyetagain> DLC is canon but it isn't the ending
[4:47:17] <1C4M3R0N1> YES
[4:47:19] <+ggbhtg> Yep
[4:47:21] <Dragon_Batman> It came out before the actual ending
[4:47:23] <1C4M3R0N1> DLC is one figh
[4:47:23] <+GreenCMD> yep
[4:47:25] <Memitim> dlc is super short
[4:47:27] <%OkamiDude15> DLC IS GIGA CANON
[4:47:27] <1C4M3R0N1> fight
[4:47:27] <+NiSoKr> DLC is what itachi fucked off to do
[4:47:29] <1C4M3R0N1> do it now
[4:47:31] <NinjaGentleman> its literally 1 fight
[4:47:33] <0rond> IT'S NOT HTE ENDING
[4:47:36] <Trigecko> Cannon but its not the ending
[4:47:36] <+Slybluedemon> The DLC is just a fight
[4:47:37] <NinjaGentleman> 1 good boss fight
[4:47:39] <+Vivaciousx3> its not "the" ending
[4:47:40] <+kommatose> Naw, all money

[4:47:47] <+ggbhtg> @woolieversus Storm 4, THEY JUST DIDNT WAIT LUL
[4:47:49] <dolphinbj> It's a B-plot, not the ending
[4:47:51] <JFrostyBeats> I think it was day one DLC
[4:47:51] <tookool5678> DLC has few fights.
[4:47:51] <+Bluydee> DLC is just 1 fight but very important
[4:47:52] <bethore> @WoolieVersus DLC is not true ending... it expands on the war
[4:47:53] <pochecito> It's not the ending, it's an important side thing tho
[4:47:54] <0rond> it's not because they didn't know if they'll make 4, it's because there wasn't canon yet
[4:47:56] <Jathspuh> tpKyawawa
[4:47:56] <+NiSoKr> It's just one fight @WoolieVersus
[4:47:57] <Memitim> it's not the ending it's just a continuation
[4:47:57] <%VidulaSaix> Guys he has to unlock it
[4:47:59] <%Exiliator> DLC isnt the ending, just a canon fight

[5:03:17] <+texflexrex> minh looks tired af
[5:03:20] <+SixMillionDollarGamer> Its cuz its new to me and I'm curious
[5:03:21] <ClairvoyantNara> yes
[5:03:21] <Victory_Boss> I go dubs to suffer
[5:03:22] <%duffydirty> and there it is
[5:03:22] <Nina96> yes
[5:03:23] <%BallerSwagBro9k> DUBS ARE FOR LOSERS
[5:03:23] <+jayban> both
[5:03:25] <%OkamiDude15> half and half
[5:03:25] <%CEGold> I'm fine with either
[5:03:25] <waffleandman> no i dont care at all
[5:03:26] <+number_1_ninja> Yes
[5:03:27] <tacostarvedbeast> background, u know it
[5:03:28] <Nina96> all 3
[5:03:29] <DatAsuna> all of th3m
[5:03:29] <Arek_1> The dub is good for Naruto.
[5:03:30] <%Exiliator> Dubs are laaame
[5:03:30] <+mestremugango> no I know what japanese is like already
[5:03:30] <+paladinstarbuster> because i work while you stream woolie
[5:03:30] <redmageryan> dubs for the lolz, and I have seen it in japanese already
[5:03:30] <Sokumotanaka> I dont want to read when I want to watch it
[5:03:31] <%ozzrabbit> japanese voices are better
[5:03:31] <wanocountry> Dub Naruto is wack
[5:03:31] <@Solidus_113> I grew up with the dub
[5:03:31] <JanusII> They prefer to be lied to by translators.
[5:03:33] <+jayban> I like gaaras voice
[5:03:33] <%Itselguapo> Dubs because background minimize I don't want to read lol.
[5:03:34] <ClairvoyantNara> Dub so i can background it
[5:03:34] <oniwahoo> I go dubs out of spite tbh
[5:03:35] <%duffydirty> @WoolieVersus its because they cant read
[5:03:35] <+LastHazzerd> Familiarity mostly, sometimes it's cuz i really like the actor
[5:03:36] <+NiSoKr> I voted dub for minimizing but I don't really care
[5:03:37] <KnivesEve> meh up to you woolie
[5:03:37] <aracon_> they just grew up with it
[5:03:37] <%Irridium> sometimes I like to tab away for stuff and dubs help with that
[5:03:38] <%IMDRanged> Sometimes i can't hear good anymore, I rather read
[5:03:38] <+DarkLinkBJ> I dont want to read
[5:03:39] <+xx123manxx> put on a podcast and let us weebs live
[5:03:39] <+WoodTheCaveman> Background and already saw subs
[5:03:39] <Whiteowlsmith> both are fine tbh
[5:03:41] <flowdere> I watch rwby and ricky and morty in japanese
[5:03:42] <%jake_protagonist> I grew up witht he dub but its garbage so sub
[5:03:44] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Background is a shitty reason
[5:03:44] <+balouie> easier to multitask with dubs
[5:03:45] <+urdunngurdunn> Column a, column b
[5:03:45] <+ggbhtg> @woolieversus I dont care, I wanna appreciate the dub for once
[5:03:46] <+chesterr01> @scoopyoopydoo 🤨🤔
[5:03:47] <+Superbro64> little coloum a little coloum b, and I heard japanese before @woolieversus
[5:03:48] <TalisKanju> I like guessing which Voice Actors are which
[5:03:48] <zaitje> for me its because its a language i can understand
[5:03:49] <+JacknZack27> I watched both, but I think the dub is pretty good.
[5:03:49] <8_Bit_Badger> Started with dubs on toonami and immediately switched to subs later
[5:03:50] <Sokumotanaka> I appreciate the work the good va's put in @WoolieVersus
[5:03:50] <+paladinstarbuster> plus i grew up with it
[5:03:50] <%croxeye> he woke up for cheese tho
[5:03:51] <+number_1_ninja> Grew up
[5:03:51] <wanocountry> Madara sounds cooler in sub
[5:03:51] <lysdexic9542> For multitasking
[5:03:51] <%jazzcrasher> Dubs so that you can hear and not miss anything they said
[5:03:51] <+xx123manxx> Kappa no Kappa
[5:03:52] <%OkamiDude15> if you want subs go for subs
[5:03:53] <Nekros4442> Subs so we can hear the voices as they're meant to be
[5:03:54] <tookool5678> storm 4 dub is weird.
[5:03:54] <+AWr00tBear> I watched it all through subs alread
[5:03:55] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> backgrounding it means you never cared to begin with so why bother
[5:04:00] <xeros720> naruto makes me pass out too
[5:04:01] <%Exiliator> Remember the puppet guys jutsu name
[5:04:04] <0rond> @WoolieVersus the DLC story is short but the fight is super hard and long so you need to get ready and if at all possible to get all the HP potions from hero routes
[5:04:06] <scoopyoopydoo> @chesterr01 wouldn
[5:04:06] <Marakami_Sadaneo> Watch/Listen to the CastleSupeeBeast podcast about the sub vs dub talk

[5:04:40] <%Youknowwhyimhere008> sounds good
[5:04:40] <+CarlosEoM> I prefer subs so I rarely multitask with anime
[5:04:42] <8_Bit_Badger> subs keep the original director's vision
[5:04:43] <Nekros4442> Woolie, most of the chat wants Subs
[5:04:43] <%duffydirty> it's your channel man do it
[5:04:43] <masterfire23> just listen to the commentary and multitask

[5:04:51] <zaitje> Just put it on spanish
[5:04:51] <Dragon_Batman> You can rotate it, TFS switched to spanish for a bit
[5:04:52] <aracon_> we gave dub a fair shot
[5:04:52] <WanderingSwordsman> go subs
[5:04:54] <oniwahoo> I mean, subs or dubs really doesn't matter and most people voted for subs
[5:04:54] <+LastHazzerd> you did the poll man!
[5:04:56] <+Superbro64> rotate is good actually @woolieversus
[5:04:57] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> oof

[5:04:59] <%Irridium> is there even a russian dub
[5:05:00] <%VidulaSaix> UDG was just a bad game Woolie
[5:05:00] <DragonSpooker> We got to hear good Gaara parts and dub Madara is cool
[5:05:01] <tacostarvedbeast> just go with Spanish, that way no ones happy
[5:05:01] <tookool5678> You can watch the anime in Dub, but the the game dub is censored.
[5:05:01] <Owkono> midway, go Spanish dubs
[5:05:01] <%duffydirty> no we're not doing this tfs bullshit
[5:05:02] <+Linearlinera> UDG oof
[5:05:02] <%croxeye> put on a random language instead
[5:05:03] <DigitalJoshie> go German dub Kappa
[5:05:03] <Reverend_Roscoe> @woolieversus 1 for them, 1 for you
[5:05:04] <%croxeye> like german
[5:05:06] <%croxeye> or french

[5:05:07] <%Itselguapo> Flip a coin Woolie.
[5:05:08] <Morning_Asakura> udg was bad tho

[5:05:10] <+ggbhtg> @woolieversus You gave dub proper due, time to switch
[5:05:13] <%Itselguapo> Roll that D2
[5:05:14] <DatAsuna> KOWASHITAI

[5:05:16] <%duffydirty> damn ultra despair girls ptsd lol
[5:05:16] <%croxeye> or polish/russian
[5:05:18] <wanocountry> Only good voice in the dub is Sasuke and Madara tbh
[5:05:18] <zepelinnn1> chat was a bunch of bitches on UDP, but the game didnt help LUL
[5:05:18] <+MrRabbles> i still listened to UDG minimized
[5:05:20] <%redrins> udg was trash however
[5:05:24] <Sokumotanaka> Okay UDG was bad but that woman became makoto in persona 5
[5:05:24] <dickbuttwoman> That LP fucking ruined you like putting your hand on a stove, didn't it?
[5:05:25] <zepelinnn1> *UDG
[5:05:25] <+LastHazzerd> @WoolieVersus the biggest issue with ultra-despair girls was that you were ALSO missing what was happening
[5:05:27] <Graxe_> Just go with French dub
[5:05:27] <scoopyoopydoo> 18 says "Johnny bye" in the fighterz sub for her lvl3 so sub>dub
[5:05:28] <Dragon_Batman> seriously though spanish is surprisingly legit
[5:05:29] <+jayban> play it twice problem solved
[5:05:33] <tacostarvedbeast> make a new poll for Spanish subs
[5:05:35] <+xx123manxx> French dub so you all can unnderstand and but nobody else can so it's a lose lose for everyone
[5:05:35] <aracon_> Chat look what you did, now woolie has to think more
[5:05:39] <DatAsuna> TMS best lp
[5:05:45] <deafmelone> @woolieversus You can surely do want you want, it is your stream
[5:05:49] <Djinnazz> Nah, that game just sux
[5:05:49] <+LastHazzerd> aight then
[5:05:52] <%redrins> the game is trash dont even beat yourself about it
[5:05:56] <scoopyoopydoo> Reggiesuperbeast when??!?!
[5:05:57] <wanocountry> There's a French dub in Storm?
[5:05:57] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Ichka Bachika De
[5:06:06] <tookool5678> Dub is censored.
[5:06:07] <%Exiliator> @WoolieVersus No matter what you choose, Ill watch it
[5:06:08] <%duffydirty> damn chat why you gotta tear a man down
[5:06:08] <+xx123manxx> just do what makes you happy, unless it involves not lping nuns 4 4Head
[5:06:14] <8_Bit_Badger> Honestly if we're talking about the naruto LP it's easier to just imagine he's saying "friendship" and "believe it"
[5:06:14] <MasterCosmic> NS4 dub / NS3 dlc sub
[5:06:18] <wanocountry> Fuu sub >>> dub
[5:06:18] <+AWr00tBear> I’m crazy and I loved the UDG lp
[5:06:19] <+LastHazzerd> Switch the language EVERY stream!
[5:06:20] <Dragon_Batman> Storm 4 has a decent number of languages
[5:06:24] <+rick_dood> if others want the rub they just play the games on their own time
[5:06:28] <Ultzerostar00> i didnt knowyou guys didUltra Despair Girls
[5:06:29] <+LastHazzerd> can't wait for German!
[5:06:29] <Arek_1> @croxeye As a Pole, Polish dubs are the worst. The majority of the time it's one voice for everyone.
[5:06:34] <@Solidus_113> Team 4Star did the Spanish dub for their NUNS4 LP
[5:06:34] <+l1nt127> @woolieversus The new league character's Japanese voice is Dio and he's a punch guy
[5:06:37] <+jayban> just do what you like to enhance your experience
[5:06:38] <alrobot2014> french dub to help me practice my french :(
[5:06:39] <%ultrasparkseid> whoo
[5:06:43] <%VidulaSaix> @WoolieVersus Since we're on the topic of 4 btw, whenever you do get around to it do NOT watch the opening for it before you play. It's massively spoilery
[5:06:45] <wanocountry> German Madara = Hitler
[5:06:46] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @scoopyoopydoo
[5:06:46] <%CommanderSqueaks> YouTube commentors are second class citizens to the superior Twitch chat.
[5:06:51] <KnivesEve> Esperanto!
[5:06:53] <+ShadowArcangel> I think I should point it out just so you don't get too anxious, the decision between sub/dub is minor for me. I'll still watch and support you
[5:06:54] <%duffydirty> ay thats me
[5:06:55] <NotLysander> @WoolieVersus you could just do it the other way and see if it affects the numbers? People wills say one thing and do another
[5:07:03] <%redrins> wasnt the momoshiki fight in nuns4 road to boruto?
[5:07:04] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> oh no
[5:07:05] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> he knows
[5:07:09] <+ggbhtg> The important thing is THIS CONFIRMS HE'S PLAYING STORM 4 Kappa
[5:07:13] <scoopyoopydoo> Do what you want woolie it's a fucking video game and you're playing it
[5:07:13] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[5:07:32] <tookool5678> its spoilers.
[5:07:32] <%duffydirty> why did sakugabooru spoil you woolie
[5:07:35] <%OkamiDude15> woolie knows nothing
[5:07:36] <+jayban> was there any difference in viewer retention between storm 2 and 3 when you switched the language?
[5:07:36] <Dragon_Batman> It was probably cut up into one
[5:07:36] <%duffydirty> damnit
[5:07:37] <wanocountry> They nerf adult Sasuke hard

[5:07:48] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 5 hours and 7 minutes
[5:07:50] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @scoopyoopydoo you still need to take into account fans, because as much as thats really a solid advice, youre still doing this for viewers
[5:07:50] <+xx123manxx> Man I wish I liked the Boruto anime but all I care about is adult OG cast LUL
[5:08:08] <wanocountry> @xx123manxx that's what fans mostly care about
[5:08:12] <Dragon_Batman> Not too surprised about Mifune
[5:08:18] <+ggbhtg> Eazy E is OP
[5:08:19] <%OkamiDude15> mifune is rad
[5:08:24] <%duffydirty> i like the boruto cast
[5:08:26] <%duffydirty> i just dont like boruto
[5:08:27] <scoopyoopydoo> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli they literally talk over the game anyway
