[0:04:39] <+ASovietSharkPro> That was deleted because the original PogChamp face tweeted some really messed up stuff after the whole political discourse that happened last month
[0:04:55] <%Lion_kun> Is there a way to bypass the stupid twitch donation character limit. i'd multi-donate but I worry Woolie might miss a donation and my post won't make any sense,
[0:05:04] <%Asuterisuku> "Political discourse." Is that what you're calling it now?
[0:05:08] <%Livelinne> Livelinne subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! Can I get a birthday shout out which heppened in Monday? Thank you in advance! Also as always, thank you for the tons of fun yall offer!

[0:05:36] <+ASovietSharkPro> I just don't want to bring up a bunch of political shit into Twitch chat
[0:05:42] <@Squdnate> @Lion_kun Sadly no. If your message is that long, you will have to donate multiple times

[0:18:40] <iswearimjustdandy> Id rather die at 76
[0:18:41] <%cobalt_phoenix_> why 76?
[0:18:51] <DatAsuna> fly high like a butterfly
[0:18:52] <Visorak6> Option 2 is pat
[0:18:52] <%AlteisenReiseZ> YEAH
[0:19:01] <@akuda_bar> you have to announce to everyone that you need to Shit
[0:19:03] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> This is my pee spot in Antarctica. I go here every time.
[0:19:06] <X2Eliah> 76 is like 50 nowadays
[0:19:07] <%Livelinne> clearl19BigBrain
[0:19:07] <daniphofani> 76 is pretty decent time to pass
[0:19:07] <%FeelinNifty> Oh, that's a good point. I was honestly leaning towards 2 but, yeah, sometimes I gotta LEAVE
[0:19:10] <+QueequegTheater> But I could go longer
[0:19:10] <NotHereToStream> 76 is good, i'd get tired of living by then
[0:19:15] <+Superbro64> Why do you people always make shit option a vs option b questions
[0:19:18] <+Stupid121v2> fly to your own shit spot on a mountain!!!
[0:19:20] <+jiggy_snipe> no window either
[0:19:22] <+runegod20> i don't expect to make it to 76, and 76 still seems good
[0:19:22] <+Superbro64> Make better questions mates
[0:19:23] <OokamiDen02> I mean.... You could die before that
[0:19:25] <+ASovietSharkPro> I'd rather be SuperMan that Pees
[0:19:25] <DatAsuna> Knowing how old I'm gonna die is too scary
[0:19:25] <GarbageNirvana> My grandma is 80 and she seems to be tired of life
[0:19:26] <+Grim1952> You canwon't be sitting in the toilet thinking about death at least
[0:19:31] <Equirah> at leas then you'd know you're not gonna day within a year LUL
[0:19:33] <servicesuspension> I lose connection for a few minutes and now piss talk
[0:19:35] <%Puhff> And dying on your bday is ruff
[0:19:37] <shieldecho> After the past couple of weeks of personal issues I'd choose option 2 in a heartbeat
[0:19:38] <MuffinMastr> @NotHereToStream you aint tired of living already??
[0:19:42] <Chaos_Switch> im 30 and im tired of living lmao
[0:19:42] <%CalderGaming> @WoolieVersus consider also: no one wants to see your 90-year-old ass pissing through the sky
[0:19:43] <%Chatterbox1991> @woolieversus you see that shit about the 117 year old French Nun that survived covid
[0:19:45] <Mr_Zero5232> I mean If using the bathroom is the only thing keeping you from being productive there‚Äôs more going on there
[0:19:45] <+jiggy_snipe> do you shit yourself in your sleep?
[0:19:47] <$Nested_Dreams> I thought getting old would be okay, but seeing my grandma suffer at 91 yo hurts, she can't remember anything
[0:19:49] <jorniev> INMORTALITY ALWAYS
[0:19:50] <@akuda_bar> i would hate to shit at superspeed, that doesnt sound comfortable
[0:19:51] <skewerstar> Wait... what if you were immortal until you hit 76?
[0:19:52] <MelBrooksKA> diapers are a thing too
[0:19:53] <+Deko_> Kreygasm
[0:19:55] <NotHereToStream> @Muffinmastr slowly getting there
[0:19:55] <+Stupid121v2> oh no sleep shitting
[0:19:56] <+nevermorecake> LUL
[0:20:00] <JayEarly> If I go shit ass will you still call me Superman?
[0:20:02] <exnuart> super man has a 100% effecient digestive system, he doesn't even need to use the bathroom
[0:20:04] <servicesuspension> Bidets are a myth!
[0:20:05] <$Nested_Dreams> I'd take option 2 just not to get old
[0:20:05] <DatAsuna> your last year would be terrifying
[0:20:07] <+QueequegTheater> My grandparents are in their mid 80s and they're still active. I wouldn't give up at 76
[0:20:08] <+Grim1952> But going to the toilet 48 times a day?
[0:20:10] <+jiggy_snipe> they said every 30 mins so legitimate question
[0:20:12] <chainsaw105> but what if every year up to 76 is spent with immortality
[0:20:13] <R0kushi> bathroom time amazing to read
[0:20:13] <linSP> Woolie says: ‚Äúshitting is AWESOME‚Äù
[0:20:16] <X2Eliah> Ah, you don't mean the "squat hole in the ground" Japanese bathroom?
[0:20:17] <RealDurdyDan> @nested_dreams Same
[0:20:19] <Blank9> I'd give up stomach aches for sure
[0:20:21] <%kewlmyc> On the opposite spectrum, the Japanese bathrooms that are just a hole in the ground
[0:20:30] <iswearimjustdandy> I would do almost anything to not have to piss
[0:20:30] <+runegod20> no, 30 minutes when you awake

[0:20:38] <+QueequegTheater> Or does it mean that in 30 minutes, you're going whether you like it or not
[0:20:41] <%caramelatte1> NON public bathrooms are great
[0:20:41] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Yeah PAT
[0:20:44] <brachydios777> While you are awake
[0:20:45] <+b_aleph> V, have you gotten your Jordans yet?
[0:20:45] <DatAsuna> you got a bidet built into your toilet or you got a bidet?
[0:20:46] <%FeelinNifty> [everyone turns to stare at Pat]
[0:20:49] <+ASovietSharkPro> The Japanese spectrum is so wide in terms of bathroom
[0:20:50] <servicesuspension> If someone offered me a way to never ever have to go to the bathroom again, I'd take it
[0:20:52] <masterfire23> read titter in the bathroom
[0:20:59] <%jinking79> save me hours at work
[0:20:59] <%Javaa01> @runegod20 Okay but what about sleep paralysis?
[0:21:03] <R0kushi> poop time is where I read
[0:21:03] <Mr_Zero5232> Turns out if you just clean the bathroom it‚Äôs not gross
[0:21:03] <@akuda_bar> poop time is nice and quiet
[0:21:05] <$thomassolorio> not to get political but what's your guys though on empeachment 2 electric boogaloo
[0:21:05] <RAH001> Pat call out
[0:21:06] <OokamiDen02> this is the weirdest conversation

[0:21:10] <NotHereToStream> no sleep is good
[0:21:10] <servicesuspension> I mean, I would still go, but only to escape from awkwardness

[0:21:15] <%BallerSwagBro9k> WELCOME TO WOOLIEVS EVERYONE LUL
[0:21:16] <brachydios777> I like a nice throne
[0:21:18] <X2Eliah> Do you want to live with like 50 years' worth of digested food stuck up your insides?
[0:21:19] <+ASovietSharkPro> Poop time takes up so little of your fucking day tho
[0:21:21] <DatAsuna> gotta sleep with a catheter
[0:21:22] <chainsaw105> hot take: the toilet seat being warm after the last person is done is SUBLIME
[0:21:22] <+Grim1952> Fast charge sleep
[0:21:24] <Blank9> fuck sleep
[0:21:27] <exnuart> just sleep 4 hours a night like me
[0:21:32] <akman14> Is anyone else having problems donating through streamlabs?
[0:21:33] <JetpackMcQuack> All those drugs are illegal
[0:21:35] <servicesuspension> I like dreaming :(
[0:21:36] <+Superbro64> ?? Whoever wrote this question may have a toilet phobia
[0:21:36] <Mr_Zero5232> Also if you don‚Äôt eat like shit it takes less time to use the bathroom
[0:21:36] <%ZweihanderSteve> lightning sleep
[0:21:38] <X2Eliah> Also if you don't poop at all you basically MUST vomit just to make room
[0:21:38] <velgaduere> that's elven sleep in DND
[0:21:38] <goodguybadman> If you take poop out of your life that‚Äôs like half of all the good things.
[0:21:40] <andre11dr> Just do meth that will do it
[0:21:41] <DatAsuna> poop time isn't enough of my life
[0:21:43] <Chaos_Switch> not having to eat
[0:21:45] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Reading books count as sleep, 1:1
[0:21:45] <$thomassolorio> interesting
[0:21:46] <%Chatterbox1991> Fast Charge Sleep or Odin Sleep
[0:21:46] <%Livelinne> woolieMINHMAX ResidentSleeper
[0:21:50] <alvaroeltz> REM on a click? oh yeah, id take that
[0:21:52] <jesuchanplays> one day we'll have tesla superchargers but for people
[0:21:55] <SereneFox> Sleeping is amazing though, it's my favorite #1 hobby
[0:21:57] <+jiggy_snipe> woah
[0:22:00] <DatAsuna> polyphasic but without the crazy person hours
[0:22:02] <+Stupid121v2> 4 hours later still awake
[0:22:03] <Chaos_Switch> I like the taste of food and all, but im so tired of wasting hours of my life standing there chewing
[0:22:14] <%Chatterbox1991> Odin Sleep is the best thing ever
[0:22:19] <Parapattern> It takes me at least two hours to fall asleep
[0:22:23] <DatAsuna> 2 hours is possible but you have to do it in 15 minute chunks throughout the day
[0:22:24] <%gatorafan> ResidentSleeper
[0:22:30] <servicesuspension> I would like to sleep for weeks at a time
[0:22:38] <%FeelinNifty> I wanted to make a batching joke but I was worried no one here would get it. Thank you @daniphofani m6kwMoisty
[0:22:40] <%jinking79> really need a Tonio's restaurant for that
[0:22:41] <DatAsuna> Polyphasic sleep is for insane people
[0:22:48] <DatAsuna> but it does seem very productive
[0:22:49] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1359058937946009600?s=19

[0:24:06] <%Asuterisuku> That was decades ago for Ridge Racer.
[0:24:08] <Chaos_Switch> lol what
[0:24:08] <iswearimjustdandy> The patent ran out a few years ago
[0:24:09] <%gatorafan> woolieDATTEBAYO
[0:24:09] <JayEarly> they patented loading screen minigames AND THEY DON'T USE THEM
[0:24:09] <+jiggy_snipe> hmmmm how many lame patents are holding back the industry
[0:24:10] <%Asuterisuku> And they did NOTHING with it.
[0:24:11] <%Chatterbox1991> CRAZY TAXI
[0:24:14] <linSP> patent EVERY MECHANIC
[0:24:16] <%Livelinne> hnyBooBoo
[0:24:16] <servicesuspension> I just checked screenshots of Mass Effect Legendary. Why do people think lens flares look good?
[0:24:21] <Mr_Rakjo> that patent died on 2017 but noone has started doing minigames on loadins screens yet @WoolieVersus
[0:24:26] <X2Eliah> Lens flares look distinctive
[0:24:31] <$Nested_Dreams> Patents for QoL are the most hurty if they are not open patents
[0:24:31] <therealtacopancakes> here in mexico we might get the third one, the russain one...
[0:24:40] <primaryfire> didn't the guy who invented the synthesis method for insulin sell the patent for $1 so that it would be widely available?
[0:24:43] <Emotional_Sledgehammer> insulin gang rise up
[0:24:44] <goodguybadman> I want a vaccine from taco bell
[0:24:56] <DatAsuna> patents make sense when you actually use it but they're far too troll-able
[0:24:56] <brachydios777> I feel the ultimate goal is to be like an Exo in Destiny where you don‚Äôt need to sleep or go to the bathroom but you can still do human things like eat, feel, and get horny
[0:25:00] <%Asuterisuku> Don't ASW games use sounds?
[0:25:09] <+b_aleph> Woolie, that sleepy guy you mentioned has absence seizures
[0:25:10] <iswearimjustdandy> There should be a patent to anti-patent things immediately, so that no one can
[0:25:14] <servicesuspension> Patents have done nothing for innovation for the last like 80 years
[0:25:17] <%LastHazzerd> uuuugh, it shouldn't be legal
[0:25:41] <%Asuterisuku> Hey, remember that one dude who patented the word "Edge?"
[0:25:45] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> woolieYE
[0:25:47] <iswearimjustdandy> @primaryfire yeah and then an asshole pataented it and now its crazy expensive
[0:25:54] <servicesuspension> That dude who patented the word Edge is now a priest
[0:25:54] <%Asuterisuku> I think Namco did the minigame thing because they were salty about that.
[0:25:56] <DatAsuna> good new name
[0:26:05] <X2Eliah> man, imagine if everyone on social media (twitch, twitter, youtube etc.) changed to using their real names
[0:26:07] <linSP> Wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúreact‚Äù patented

[0:37:35] <MuffinMastr> Ill definately go check that out: Penn and tellers bullshit?
[0:37:35] <jorniev> Sometimes the idea of what they stood for is more important than the historical person themselves.
[0:37:36] <servicesuspension> Gandhi did fuck all those children
[0:37:36] <+Radkon> It was the Dalai Lama by the looks of it
[0:37:37] <Karego_at> yea they're fucking awful, che guevara too
[0:37:38] <%aram909> gandhi thought that black people were animals
[0:37:41] <%kewlmyc> Ghandi was racist and kinda pedo with his niece
[0:37:42] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus The Dalaia Lama
[0:37:42] <%aram909> and deserved to be at the back of the train

[0:37:55] <jorniev> uuuugh
[0:37:55] <%LastHazzerd> every revolution for the people was started by the 2nd in command who wanted to be the new ruling class
[0:37:58] <X2Eliah> It's not for nothing that Ghandi is known to choose the nuclear option asap
[0:37:59] <%aram909> @Afterman_ he forced his niece to sleep next to him while he was naked
[0:38:01] <%ChoculaUltra> wait till you read about Ghandi's experiments on sexuality LUL
[0:38:02] <$thomassolorio> mother teresa was MASGUS
[0:38:02] <+Stupid121v2> GOD fuck that
[0:38:10] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Also he hated Africans
[0:38:11] <DatAsuna> Tibet was big into the caste system and torturing their slaves
[0:38:11] <%aram909> so he could prove that he could resist temptations
[0:38:11] <%Livelinne> MonkaS
[0:38:13] <@Menitta> At least we got Nobunaga Kappa

[0:38:21] <%BallerSwagBro9k> OOF
[0:38:22] <brunoberserk> you telling me madre teresa is a blasphemous boss ?
[0:38:22] <%BinaryFireball> Mother Theresa unlocked that weird as rubix cube
[0:38:28] <digitalslime> @Afterman_ ya ganddi slept naked as a "test of chasity"
[0:38:29] <+toomuchsnarfsnarf> Suffer like G did
[0:38:29] <+Stupid121v2> Ghandi was just PEEPIN THINGS OUT
[0:38:30] <LVL1_Scumbag> The special shooreh pippi
[0:38:30] <%jinking79> no one prays for Lucifer who suffers the most
[0:38:32] <catalyst40> Wasn't Theresa this big-time madame?
[0:38:33] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Ghandi was also a big racist
[0:38:39] <OldManDeckardCain> "I'm just testing my resolve, by lying next to my niece all night" Kappa
[0:38:40] <+Joe2187> Mother Theresa was a Cenobite?
[0:38:41] <DatAsuna> Majima would not approve of ghandi
[0:38:42] <digitalslime> *with kids in his bed
[0:38:49] <$thomassolorio> mother teresa was a berserk character
[0:38:50] <%BisoromiBear> he was trading in compo
[0:38:51] <servicesuspension> Every cartoon network revival gets us closer and closer to the endgame: Big O Season 3
[0:38:53] <Afterman_> @Joe2187 yea basiclly
[0:38:56] <%aram909> as an indian its really hard to talk to my indian family and friends about gandhi
[0:38:59] <iswearimjustdandy> @joe2187 assdghdjfk
[0:39:01] <%aram909> they refuse to hear the truth
[0:39:03] <X2Eliah> NONE OF OUR FOOD IS NATURAL
[0:39:06] <AnneSQF> what show are we taking about?
[0:39:13] <servicesuspension> Like 99% of potatoes are straight up poison
[0:39:14] <Afterman_> veggies are tehnically GMOs by simply breeding them in general
[0:39:15] <DatAsuna> Bananas are the hardest counter to the GMO fear
[0:39:20] <digitalslime> penn & tellers bullshit
[0:39:23] <goodguybadman> That‚Äôs GMO shit is all bull shit
[0:39:23] <Karego_at> all food is gmo.... like no plant looks like that naturally
[0:39:23] <DatAsuna> Tomatoes are GMOs
[0:39:27] <%wibbwobbler> bananas are neat
[0:39:28] <AhmCha> If you eat corn, you're eating the longest living GMO in existence
[0:39:29] <AnneSQF> @digitalslime cheers
[0:39:29] <%aram909> all the food we eat is genetically modified
[0:39:29] <+runegod20> don't hate the game hate the player
[0:39:34] <$thomassolorio> they also said smoking wasn't bad but regretted it
[0:39:36] <%LastHazzerd> it's the only damn reason we can "support" this population.
[0:39:36] <+toomuchsnarfsnarf> All modified
[0:39:38] <%aram909> "non-GMO" is just a scam buzzword
[0:39:38] <%BinaryFireball> people could eat
[0:39:43] <valriot> Natural pre-GMO bananas are FUCKING SHIT
[0:39:44] <%aram909> to increase the prices of food
[0:39:53] <servicesuspension> Penn and Teller also fucked up, but they had some good takes
[0:39:55] <+Ether101_Prime> All crop and cattle based food is genetically modified.
[0:39:57] <Karego_at> gmo is good, copyrighting gmo's and shitting on farmers is not
[0:40:13] <+Joe2187> GMOs have been a thing since fucking machu piccu
[0:40:13] <%Asuterisuku> Better not eat bananas.
[0:40:14] <Afterman_> fuckin cross-pollination is GMO
[0:40:17] <AhmCha> Never forget than Greenpeace lobbied to prevent "golden rice" which could have massively prevented blindness in Africa from being distributed
[0:40:19] <atgithursdays> shoutout to Norman, native Iowan and one of two Iowa statues in the us capitol
[0:40:20] <MuffinMastr> that sounds like the opposite of what we associate with GMO that sounds like sharecropping which is illegal now.
[0:40:23] <LVL1_Scumbag> That's literally why corn is a thing
[0:40:23] <linSP> don‚Äôt start talking about MSG too
[0:40:25] <$thomassolorio> legit hero
[0:40:26] <%Livelinne> Gmo redemption arc OhMyDog

[0:40:32] <%aram909> and taste way worse than other apples imo
[0:40:33] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus If you hate GMOs but like bananas, I have some BAD NEWS FOR YOU
[0:40:34] <+runegod20> and haven't anti GMO food people denied tons of food to starving people in third world countries because they were GMO?
[0:40:34] <servicesuspension> The term Genetically Modified was concocted to evoke Resident Evil-esque imagery
[0:40:35] <+Trickyvic13> thats why bananas aren't fied witg
[0:40:36] <+Joe2187> BANANAS
[0:40:37] <AnneSQF> the Dutch... *shakes fist*
[0:40:37] <iswearimjustdandy> Gmos are fine, corporation policies about there commercial use in underdeveloped countries is bad, its about corporate misuse

[0:46:12] <+Stupid121v2> 4 is really great.
[0:46:14] <iswearimjustdandy> @runegod20 soba is god like if you like chewiness in noodles
[0:46:16] <+runegod20> 3's big problem is mostly just beginning pacing and a bit of the combat
[0:46:19] <%notsoy> @Wofoeh no, he did not
[0:46:25] <andre11dr> 4 is really great
[0:46:26] <+Stupid121v2> HELL YEAH V good opinions
[0:46:26] <jotabranded> oh that's cool
[0:46:27] <+nevermorecake> Woah
[0:46:27] <%Asuterisuku> There are a couple different towns.
[0:46:30] <%patriotrenegade> ur wrong tho
[0:46:31] <%Chatterbox1991> But Kiwami 2 tho
[0:46:31] <%dukenux> Yeah, prolly better squeeze in a different game between those
[0:46:31] <AnneSQF> in real life, everyone has their own little side quest
[0:46:32] <Halospaz117> I respect that
[0:46:32] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus As someone who marathonned all 8 mainine games in 3 months, FUCK MARATHONNING
[0:46:34] <@Menitta> Really? Thats a unique opinion
[0:46:35] <%aram909> 3 is very good but i personally prefer 4 out of 3-5
[0:46:36] <+runegod20> i don't know how much I actually do care about my noodles being chewie, still sound interesting
[0:46:37] <ghoststalker> Kick mans!
[0:46:38] <leith_aziz> Shen feels the same, funnily enough
[0:46:40] <DatAsuna> 3's big problem is the generation switch, a much bigger focus was on replacing the tech
[0:46:41] <@Menitta> Not wrong but unique
[0:46:45] <digitalslime> just finished 3 and i'm only 20% completed for the completion log.
[0:46:46] <strudel_h> I wanna play the yakuza games but I hope there's not any I should skip
[0:46:47] <PsychoPearl> I like 3
[0:46:47] <primaryfire> I love that 3 recognises kiryu for his humanity rather than him being a punching machine for the first time
[0:46:47] <OokamiDen02> 4 is my favorite after 0
[0:46:50] <Solidnick18> 4 is pretty good
[0:46:50] <Wofoeh> @notsoy just saw the guys of the producer sidequest which is required to start that one
[0:46:51] <leith_aziz> But she liked the orphanage stuff alot
[0:46:51] <+MrBaldachin> I recently finished 3 and I really dislike its story, but other than that and some combat gripes it's great
[0:46:52] <@Menitta> 3 is still a good game
[0:46:53] <X2Eliah> oh ... (
[0:46:55] <%Asuterisuku> 3 is a filler episode.
[0:46:57] <morow1ec> Combat in 3 sucks
[0:46:59] <%r0chelimit> 4 is a good game but FUCK does that story turn shit
[0:47:00] <jotabranded> 4 is a amazing, 5 is even better
[0:47:02] <ghoststalker> 3‚Äôs twist was dumb
[0:47:02] <astrophizz> it's just to build bonds with characters
[0:47:04] <%dukenux> The Empty Lot area
[0:47:04] <+runegod20> you can kind of understanding the pacing of the beginning of 3 but it's still kind of slow
[0:47:07] <servicesuspension> Localize the samurai game :(
[0:47:12] <ghoststalker> 4‚Äôs twist was dumber
[0:47:13] <%notsoy> @Wofoeh no, the dominatrix sidequest is not connected to anything else
[0:47:14] <DatAsuna> That whole opening is purely to get you emotionally invested, and it doesn't do that as well as it could
[0:47:16] <%patriotrenegade> I am gathering my nails.
[0:47:22] <ghoststalker> Also, way too many blocking enemies
[0:47:22] <PKSomething> 3's story with the place kiryu is now is baller, shush
[0:47:26] <leith_aziz> "4/5 memories"
[0:47:27] <Wofoeh> @woolieversus 3 is quite literally the beach episode
[0:47:29] <fIashman92> But the Mark II though!
[0:47:30] <%kewlmyc> Yakuza has dumb fucking plot twists, you're not wrong
[0:47:35] <+Grim1952> 6 had the most dissapointing ending for me
[0:47:36] <DatAsuna> Boy are 4 and 5 not gonna buck that trend
[0:47:37] <glaciusinfinite> where we chat?
[0:47:37] <%notsoy> WEAPON SHOP IS NEARBY
[0:47:39] <+bPlusPlus> you get a business buddy from the Dominatrix thing
[0:47:41] <+Stupid121v2> Absolutely
[0:47:45] <+runegod20> 3 just has a bigger cast and they give each cast a big of an arc
[0:47:48] <glaciusinfinite> where we at chat?
[0:47:51] <+Stupid121v2> feels like boneless modern yakuza
[0:47:54] <DatAsuna> 3 added a lot of what became the formula yeah
[0:47:54] <brachydios777> That‚Äôs fair
[0:47:55] <%kewlmyc> You probably can
[0:48:00] <+Deko_> LUL
[0:48:00] <leith_aziz> 5 Only gets worse because it tries to build a mystery, same with 4
[0:48:02] <brunoberserk> OOOOFF
[0:48:06] <Darren716> That's not hard V
[0:48:07] <Wofoeh> @notsoy dude, I KNOW FOR A FACT, that that quest only shows up AFTER you do the producer one (for some reason)
[0:48:07] <@Menitta> Oh god
[0:48:07] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL LUL LUL
[0:48:09] <andre11dr> I liked where it went in 2 ,i know it's kinda dumb but i like that about it
[0:48:09] <@Menitta> thats the worst
[0:48:14] <%SilverDevilfish> 5 may prevent that
[0:48:16] <+QueequegTheater> I think he can get to 7, but beating it?
[0:48:17] <PsychoPearl> 5 is pretty long
[0:48:17] <leith_aziz> interesting
[0:48:18] <Timarkot> Did woolie grind offscreen
[0:48:19] <Pnutz409> lol
[0:48:19] <@Menitta> They are the same with progressively worse editing
[0:48:19] <+FireBallSuper> Should I just play 3 on easy so I can get through it quicker?
[0:48:19] <+Liquid_Dio> Same with John Wick
[0:48:20] <%notsoy> @Wofoeh the dominatrix quest? absolutely not
[0:48:20] <%dukenux> Oh no, the camera shakes
[0:48:23] <DSD24> Supremacy was not as good
[0:48:24] <%Asuterisuku> Only playing once a week is going to make this take forever.
[0:48:24] <LVL1_Scumbag> Like Transformers
[0:48:25] <DatAsuna> 5 is my personal fave
[0:48:27] <%notsoy> you're confusing that with the follow-up quest involving miracle
[0:48:27] <ChansonNoire> same with john wick yeah
[0:48:28] <ghoststalker> 4 is cool for introducing kick man and Bear man
[0:48:34] <%notsoy> check the cyricz guides my guy
[0:48:36] <iswearimjustdandy> Those movies suck ass
[0:48:39] <%SveriSageAdvice> sverisageadvice subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! Just wanted to say hi and wish both you and Little V a wonderful day, thank you for the LPs!
[0:48:45] <+talkingrain3139> 5 is long as fuck but is amazing
[0:48:45] <OokamiDen02> that's why 4 is great
[0:48:46] <astrophizz> They're (especially 2) like the Dear Sister SNL skit
[0:48:46] <%dukenux> i'd be okay with Bourne ending in 3 movies tbh
[0:48:46] <+aram909> 4is great because akiyama rules and also its the most ACAB the games get
[0:48:48] <KingVantq> @FireBallSuper unless you care about 100%ing it yeah
[0:48:50] <Pnutz409> f&F series
[0:48:52] <leith_aziz> I think he gets really fun in 6
[0:48:53] <Wofoeh> Oh absolutely, 5 is gonna be a H U R D L E
[0:48:56] <+runegod20> the humanizing moments for kiryu are good, which I feel 3 did really good
[0:48:56] <+Grim1952> It's good they retired Kiryu
[0:48:58] <DatAsuna> Tanimura is my fave from 4
[0:48:59] <leith_aziz> I loved him there
[0:49:02] <LVL1_Scumbag> You look like a criminal?
[0:49:03] <shurtal> Kiryu is the bus you pilot while plot happens around him
[0:49:04] <+ThirdRatePunk> ThirdRatePunk subscribed with Prime. 
[0:49:05] <+bPlusPlus> oh
[0:49:06] <Blank9> Yeah, other protagonists really help the series
[0:49:09] <DatAsuna> And I feel so awkward about the new actor

[0:49:38] <DatAsuna> @QueequegTheater He was my fave and the new haircut looks awful
[0:49:40] <+RJay80> Himbo Aura
[0:49:43] <%Livelinne> joofbHmm
[0:49:49] <X2Eliah> Man Kiryu is surprisingly closed-minded
[0:49:56] <X2Eliah> did not even want to do the hustle
[0:49:56] <servicesuspension> he's like 20
[0:50:18] <%Livelinne> but he has a sugar daddy
[0:50:18] <X2Eliah> TRAP

[0:50:22] <servicesuspension> ... this is getting real gay
[0:50:24] <brachydios777> Kiryu later on is actually really accepting of people
[0:50:24] <+QueequegTheater> I'm expecting 8 guys with guns to be in there
[0:50:42] <+runegod20> you can tell it's dragon and tiger since they just reuse the inside pretty much

[0:50:59] <digitalslime> i never found this
[0:51:02] <ghoststalker> Oh, I knew I noticed the dragon and tiger characters on the door
[0:51:06] <leith_aziz> Compare Kiryu here, than compare that to 5 and 6
[0:51:07] <LVL1_Scumbag> He just wants to run his restaurant
[0:51:11] <servicesuspension> That's not even related
[0:51:12] <+runegod20> i've seen so many playthroughs of 0 where the person never finds the dragon and tiger for kiryu until end game, it's super missable
[0:51:15] <X2Eliah> Man I did not expect the secret weapon-smith cover restaurant to be a feaking FRANCHISE
[0:51:16] <Wofoeh> Same shit different day
[0:51:20] <leith_aziz> There's obviously a difference
[0:51:28] <%Lion_kun> BUY THE ZAP GUN
[0:51:47] <%Livelinne> man I want some ramen + gyoza
[0:51:50] <+QueequegTheater> No one needs the zap gun
[0:51:50] <leith_aziz> I actually missed this shop my first playthrough
[0:51:52] <%aram909> get the zap gun, and proceed to win every single shakedown from now on
[0:51:54] <HollowMan190> cool......wepons are unless till 7/5
[0:52:04] <rusho> Mr. Shakedown fears the zap bubbly2Smug
[0:52:06] <Wofoeh> @x2eliah I‚Äôll have an dagger, a katana, 2 slime guns.... and some dumplings please
[0:52:16] <servicesuspension> He just wants to grill goddamit
[0:52:19] <leith_aziz> Slimegun is also effective, but more hilarious
[0:52:26] <+runegod20> i don't think woolie did too much of the agent stuff so I assume he doesn't have much stuff to buy
[0:52:32] <+Grim1952> Just give em a staminan

[0:52:37] <%Livelinne> LUL
[0:52:37] <ghoststalker> @hollowman190 not true, the speed run for 3 depends on buying guns
[0:52:39] <+QueequegTheater> You don't need the zap gun to beat shakedown you just need the drunken master upgrade for Brawler

[0:53:38] <%big_laser_boss> @queequegtheater you only need the Quick-change clothes
[0:53:43] <+runegod20> the yakuza universe is a place where the streets of japan are flooded with barbarians called Hooligans
[0:53:45] <brachydios777> Considering how much Yakuza use swords and shit in this universe
[0:53:45] <@Solidus_113> Anime figures cost more than guns

[0:56:37] <%gatorafan> :l
[0:56:38] <+runegod20> did we start getting the skills for knuckles for rush yet?
[0:56:42] <%Javaa01> Also you could just sell the Lumber
[0:56:44] <%wibbwobbler> psaUp
[0:56:49] <%Javaa01> Cause it's kind of a waste of a slot
[0:56:52] <+runegod20> it only cost a mil to repair everything, that's nothing
[0:56:55] <%doomerskeletor13> Capitalism Souls
[0:56:55] <digitalslime> weapon grinding is only worth it if you are a completonist or want unbreakable stuff anyway.
[0:56:55] <%dukenux> Marlin Cannon PogChamp
[0:57:02] <X2Eliah> RB
[0:57:03] <+Grim1952> Buy a zweihander
[0:57:04] <$dudedude55555> take the umbrella
[0:57:07] <%cobalt_phoenix_> V get him to do hammer heat moces
[0:57:10] <X2Eliah> WAIT
[0:57:11] <%dukenux> i read that as butter knife
[0:57:12] <%cobalt_phoenix_> moves*
[0:57:17] <X2Eliah> STUN GUN IS A KNIFE?!
[0:57:18] <+Ether101_Prime> When you do the minigame you get more options.
[0:57:20] <+runegod20> rarity
[0:57:20] <+QueequegTheater> Ooh maybe we can do a quick 50 pull
[0:57:30] <+runegod20> a basic dagger like that is super common and generic
[0:57:32] <%dukenux> It's one of those contact stun guns
[0:57:38] <%dukenux> its not a tazer
[0:57:39] <digitalslime> like stun gun actualy stagers
[0:57:40] <%CalderGaming> no?????
[0:57:41] <%patriotrenegade> Mmmmm, no.
[0:57:45] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Ehhhh
[0:57:46] <superchunk121> What?
[0:57:46] <$dudedude55555> a gun is a knife as well, it's just ranged
[0:57:49] <Pnutz409> progressive knife
[0:57:49] <%doomerskeletor13> Star Wars Vibro Knife
[0:57:49] <SomersaultJustice> it's like a tiny spear
[0:57:52] <X2Eliah> ...
[0:57:52] <+Grim1952> It's a baton maybe
[0:57:52] <%Asuterisuku> You have to do a bunch of weapon gathering with Majima in order to unlock more things.
[0:57:53] <Afterman_> a taser is just a long range knife
[0:57:54] <X2Eliah> damn
[0:57:54] <%dukenux> yep, it's melee
[0:57:54] <servicesuspension> Resident Evil 1 says stun guns and knives work the same
[0:57:55] <brachydios777> Kinda
[0:57:57] <X2Eliah> it is
[0:57:57] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:57:58] <%BinaryFireball> god Im reminded of that co2 knife
[0:58:00] <%Livelinne> wooliePOYO MorphinTime
[0:58:00] <+runegod20> i don't know where else to classify a taser
[0:58:04] <CappuccinoGuil> This is NOT a stun gun, for sure.
[0:58:06] <+runegod20> stun gun i mean
[0:58:08] <%aram909> eh, knives still break skin and draw blood
[0:58:08] <+bPlusPlus> knives are keys too because they unlock your death
[0:58:08] <X2Eliah> STUN GUN IS A STAR WARS KNIFE
[0:58:10] <%aram909> stun guns don't
[0:58:13] <enZymeth> Electric light saber
[0:58:14] <@Solidus_113> oh god
[0:58:17] <%cobalt_phoenix_> HAMMER
[0:58:18] <jetjagger222> UNLIMITED POWAH
[0:58:19] <shurtal> Stun gun, NOT GUN SHAPED, fuckin' weirds me out
[0:58:23] <fIashman92> Only Kiryu has sledge hammer heat moves fyi
[0:58:24] <%Chatterbox1991> I mean Taser Darts are technically a gun @woolieversus
[0:58:26] <andre11dr> I mean isn't there actual electric knifes?
[0:58:29] <%jonblnt> stun gun is still a one handed weapon
[0:58:34] <CappuccinoGuil> Do Stars also indicate durability?
[0:58:37] <$dudedude55555> technically, your hands are knives
[0:58:39] <%dukenux> Nickelodeon Gun
[0:58:45] <+Grim1952> Brass knucles have an special heat move i think
[0:58:47] <@Solidus_113> could it be in the item box?
[0:58:49] <+runegod20> knuckles could be good for rush
[0:58:53] <%dukenux> monkaS
[0:58:55] <%Asuterisuku> Brass Knuckles are REALLY good with Rush.
[0:58:59] <+QueequegTheater> HOW IS THAT SAFE
[0:59:00] <digitalslime> shoot fire
[0:59:00] <diontmack> slime guns absolutely fuck shakedown
[0:59:01] <servicesuspension> @shurtal You think that's fucking weird? Taser means Thomas A Swift's Electric Rifle. Thomas A Swift is not a real person
[0:59:02] <Wofoeh> @woolieversus and the taser also shares the move set with the knives, so it adds up
[0:59:03] <%AlteisenReiseZ> USE THE HEAT MOVE WITH IT.
[0:59:07] <%dukenux> do you use it with a hairspray
[0:59:19] <srv4254> "storage"
[0:59:19] <CappuccinoGuil> [GUN]
[0:59:22] <%gatorafan> Feel the heat :)
[0:59:23] <DatAsuna> Woolie "blaze" madden
[0:59:24] <%wibbwobbler> woolieT
[0:59:26] <%RadicalWeegee> Pyromania never truly leaves you
[0:59:29] <X2Eliah> "Binding"?
[0:59:31] <%Asuterisuku> Ah yes, the Kujo Jotaro method of protection.
[0:59:33] <%doomerskeletor13> Woolie was doing heat moves with his trick lighter
[0:59:33] <%dukenux> lmao
[0:59:35] <Vigogs> Jojo reference
[0:59:38] <brachydios777> Pyro Woolie
[0:59:41] <+runegod20> just put a copy of one piece in your waist band, treat it like a cup
[0:59:47] <+TheShisno> Put it under your hat
[0:59:49] <%big_laser_boss> FUCK ANY OF THOSE, QUICK-CHANGE CLOTHES
[0:59:49] <+Ether101_Prime> Do all weapon types have an infinite variant?
[0:59:50] <servicesuspension> Luckily I had the bible in my pocket
[1:00:10] <andre11dr> Kiryu doesn't get the cigarette move in this dosen't he?
[1:00:11] <%cobalt_phoenix_> Buy 1ups
[1:00:15] <%big_laser_boss> Mew Mew shoes
[1:00:26] <+runegod20> and even without that, it has nice stats
[1:00:27] <CappuccinoGuil> STATS, THO
[1:00:30] <+Mendin> I mean considering how much running around Kamurocho he's doing, comfy shoes sound important
[1:00:41] <CappuccinoGuil> The stats on that traveler's amulet, though
[1:00:43] <+runegod20> one is magic pixel, one is a self ref kind of
[1:00:44] <servicesuspension> Never underestimate comfy shoes
[1:00:45] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @big_laser_boss soon tm
[1:00:59] <+Ether101_Prime> @andre11dr I don't think so.
[1:01:08] <%big_laser_boss> New moves > stats
[1:01:12] <AhmCha> Ehhhhhh
[1:01:26] <+Grim1952> Knuckles!
[1:01:27] <mortificent> Kinda, depends on the game
[1:01:33] <+QueequegTheater> On Legend it does but Hard is not a huge jump from Normal
[1:01:42] <servicesuspension> How do you buy a slime gun in 2021
[1:01:45] <Ultrahalda> on the amon army in kiwami 2 on legend its useful
[1:01:47] <+runegod20> does the shop use the weapons that you find or only weapons that you craft as majima?
[1:01:48] <%big_laser_boss> The mew mew she's work in cut-scenes
[1:01:54] <@Solidus_113> There's a whole questline for upgrading the "Nameless Katana"
[1:02:04] <NotHereToStream> slime shotgun is an anti shakedown weapon iirc
[1:02:07] <+Ether101_Prime> What about the Spicy Knife?
[1:02:14] <CappuccinoGuil> Repair time?
[1:02:15] <+QueequegTheater> I picture Kiryu using a Western broadsword while wearing that fucking American Flag shirt from 3
[1:02:17] <DatAsuna> 5 also has the best katana moves
[1:02:20] <ricky12k1> Wait till woolie gets further in the yakuza series there‚Äôs a lot more wacky stuff
[1:02:25] <Solidnick18> it's very good
[1:02:29] <+runegod20> extra knuckles for rush sounds good, though right now they'd only be the crap ones
[1:02:33] <+Grim1952> Kiryu goes akimbo
[1:02:48] <@Solidus_113> Kiryu loaded up like a real gamer
[1:02:53] <Wofoeh> Slime is the shit
[1:03:10] <servicesuspension> I don't like weapon combat unless it's found weapons, otherwise it feels like betraying the beat em up roots
[1:03:11] <+QueequegTheater> LUL
[1:03:11] <mortificent> Wait, V is up to 4?? damn
[1:03:13] <CappuccinoGuil> It's the 80s LUL
[1:03:15] <Solidnick18> yep
[1:03:19] <%Asuterisuku> Man, you get a lot of INVENTORY SPACE in this game.
[1:03:19] <+Grim1952> In other Yakuza you gotta earn the money
[1:03:21] <+Deko_> pretty handy we are buddies with the cop now
[1:03:25] <%big_laser_boss> Knuckles are really good for rush
[1:03:26] <+KymeraKirsty> it's the 80s!
[1:03:28] <Prevot> very accurate depiction of japanese economy
[1:03:28] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Woolie there is a pair of Brawler upgrades that make Heat moves take off an entire bar of Shakedown's health
[1:03:36] <+runegod20> manga is made to be super low level gear
[1:03:37] <Solidnick18> other ones you gotta grind for skill points
[1:03:38] <CappuccinoGuil> Traveler's Amulet is better than the belt, though
[1:03:43] <+Liquid_Dio> i feel like Kiryu disproportionately gets shitty healing items for random encounters compared to Majima
[1:03:45] <ricky12k1> Well yea it‚Äôs 80s japan. They had a lot money to burn back then
[1:03:54] <ricky12k1> Before the bubble popped
[1:04:02] <Wofoeh> @woolieversus slime gun is good for when you‚Äôre feeling lazy vs an shakedown
[1:04:03] <%Asuterisuku> Woolie should go see his trainers.
[1:04:05] <servicesuspension> It's the 80's, go to an anime con and watch high quality ovas
[1:04:05] <%aram909> If you want to grind and get big big money against Mr Shakedown, theres a specific shotgun-like gun called the Zap Gun you can get by like Chapter 7 or 8 which will take down literally 2/3 of an entire shakedown's healthbar. 3 hours will net you easily close to 500 billion or so yen
[1:04:07] <chainsaw105> we can do more bacchus training
[1:04:09] <X2Eliah> 100 kks
[1:04:09] <%big_laser_boss> Thank God Woolie understands the value of Quick-change clothes
[1:04:09] <%Javaa01> Gotta start hitting up those style trainers
[1:04:11] <alvaroeltz> talk to bacchus and unlock the moces
[1:04:14] <alvaroeltz> move*
[1:04:14] <+runegod20> the later games do kind of have lower money costs , which fits with giving less money
[1:04:34] <%RyTYoung> OH GOD
[1:04:38] <Solidnick18> he's a man on a mission woolie
[1:04:44] <+Chronobot> The ultimate life form lurks everywhere
[1:04:44] <$BallerSwagBro9k> SHAKEDOWN EVERYWHERE SYSTEM
[1:04:45] <%dukenux> He's lurking in the backrooms...
[1:05:01] <%Asuterisuku> You complained about that last week.
[1:05:01] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:05:16] <servicesuspension> I'LL KILL YOU
[1:05:16] <@Solidus_113> NEMESIS SYSTEM?
[1:05:16] <%big_laser_boss> Swap style mid attack
[1:05:20] <+ShinNoir> @aram909 you can actually get it immediately from the million yen dream machines. i got it in chapter 2 recently and its great
[1:05:25] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus "Would you like to take my asskicking survey"
[1:05:25] <rookielime> Are you doing remastered? God that sounds so annoying
[1:05:29] <X2Eliah> Isn't Nemesis system also patented?
[1:05:30] <servicesuspension> You can't have nemesis system now :C
[1:05:31] <+Negus_Rex> the Rapper in 4 is great though
[1:05:36] <@Menitta> Its like Pokemon. "You're walking on route 216? I'LL KILL YOU!"
[1:05:42] <+Ether101_Prime> You look like a Yakuza, I'll kill ya'!
[1:05:43] <joshua_42> V how are you feeling about the first new character compared to Kiryu
[1:05:44] <%doomerskeletor13> Oh that‚Äôs a good one
[1:05:46] <%dukenux> Walkman
[1:05:48] <Wofoeh> @woolieversus V remind woolie to do the producer sidequest, to start the progress of getting the encounter finder
[1:05:51] <rookielime> Patenting mechanics is the goddamn worst idea.
[1:05:52] <DSD24> Youngster Joey wants to kill you with his Ratata
[1:05:54] <$dudedude55555> ARA-Q3 is amazing
[1:05:59] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YEYEYEYYEYEYE
[1:05:59] <Jp_DrZaius> yeyeye
[1:06:00] <WillyFresh992> producer is important
[1:06:08] <Solidnick18> the producer one is pretty good
[1:06:11] <%big_laser_boss> Swap style mid attack
[1:06:14] <JayEarly> You remember Kiryu, when you punch in the face a hundred times?
[1:06:15] <%Asuterisuku> Roughly 100 side quests.
[1:06:16] <Wofoeh> BOTH are great
[1:06:25] <servicesuspension> Patenting mechanics is scummy shit. The only thing scummier is that time Candy Crush tried to trademark the word Saga
[1:06:26] <+QueequegTheater> @Asuterisuku exactly 100
[1:06:27] <Solidnick18> oh yeah the masters
[1:06:29] <+Mendin> Echoes of Liam from the Nier:Automata playthrough going "Best track in the game coming up right here"
[1:06:33] <dead_harmony13> Have you found the dominatrix yet?
[1:06:33] <%big_laser_boss> FADC drop-kicks
[1:06:38] <ricky12k1> Playing a yakuza game is playing all side quests
[1:06:40] <CharlieDJohnson> only bad sidequests are the pocket racer sidequests because theyre tied to pocket racer, and i regret nothing of what i just said
[1:06:46] <%doomerskeletor13> Bacchus has some good moves
[1:06:51] <+runegod20> baccus is the quickest one to do the training for
[1:06:54] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Funniest thing about the whole "Punks going up to Kiryu and getting their asses handed to them" It's gang initiation
[1:06:55] <%Asuterisuku> Hey yeah, Woolie, go check your money!
[1:06:56] <+runegod20> and gives good stuff
[1:06:59] <servicesuspension> @CharlieDJohnson I also regret what you just said
[1:07:11] <%r0chelimit> You can‚Äôt go wrong with training honestly
[1:07:12] <$dudedude55555> @CharlieDJohnson mods ban this man, it's pat in disguise
[1:07:16] <ricky12k1> @charliedjohnson well be prepared to get hunted by pocket circuit racers
[1:07:18] <fIashman92> You forgot the porn card finder, the most important item
[1:07:19] <Ultrahalda> and also becoming a LEGEND
[1:07:25] <%doomerskeletor13> You can do the real estate grinding while you do substories too
[1:07:29] <Solidnick18> very good reward for that
[1:07:32] <%big_laser_boss> Has Woolie trained his dominatrix?
[1:07:32] <servicesuspension> Real estate is so good
[1:07:33] <OblivionSword1> Business in 0 is MANDATORY
[1:07:43] <servicesuspension> I wish I was a real estate guy
[1:07:47] <%dukenux> real estate is a proper secondary game in this
[1:07:58] <jaygee303> It‚Äôs very important for an insane ass counter
[1:07:59] <CappuccinoGuil> LET'S GO REAL STATE
[1:08:00] <+QueequegTheater> COUGH COUGH
[1:08:02] <@Menitta> Its free
[1:08:03] <Solidnick18> Say whaaat
[1:08:07] <+Ancopro> real estate has removed my limits
[1:08:10] <+runegod20> my friend delayed doing real estate until the end of the game and after he did all the side stories, so he was really bored waiting to collect money
[1:08:12] <%Livelinne> shiaLUL
[1:08:17] <%dukenux> *whispers* It's Real Estate
[1:08:17] <servicesuspension> only through real estate you can unlock your GOUGI

[1:20:54] <Wofoeh> Daro? DARO??
[1:20:54] <Halospaz117> I think Kiryu just flat out says the knife is what you want to use if you want to erase someone
[1:20:58] <+runegod20> you need to get the money shot, especially if food is the big thing they're doing
[1:21:02] <+QueequegTheater> Wait is that actual food

[1:35:05] <%LastHazzerd> if you are 1 person, whateverf
[1:35:05] <DatAsuna> gamejam crunch fun, but it's voluntary
[1:35:07] <@Solidus_113> you get it NG+
[1:35:10] <LVL1_Scumbag> SMALL doses being the important part
[1:35:12] <+jiggy_snipe> is Woolie crunching himself right now?
[1:35:14] <%Asuterisuku> Wait for the Premium Adventure.
[1:35:18] <%phd_in_thuggery> Woolie, Crunch woolieGLORY
[1:35:18] <+runegod20> NG+, and post game
[1:35:18] <For_Temeria> Nah premium adventure only
[1:35:20] <rcand9> you do get it
[1:35:22] <%baka_sugoi> after game unlock
[1:35:22] <OblivionSword1> on premium adventure you get it
[1:35:23] <Explodincatz> why would u play on NG+?
[1:35:24] <%Javaa01> During NG+ you can just use whatever outfit you want
[1:35:30] <%doomerskeletor13> Any outfit that Kiryu wears is available in NGL+
[1:35:32] <Blank9> postgame and ng+ give you a lot of outfits
[1:35:32] <Prevot> they never let you switch clothes on 1st playthrough sadly
[1:35:35] <Blank9> including the karaoke outfits
[1:35:45] <+Crippl3> The best change they made in Like A Dragon is that you have access to costume change on your first playthrough
[1:35:45] <+runegod20> the knuckle heat moves are also in rush style
[1:35:46] <%LastHazzerd> @DatAsuna honestly i always wondered why folk loved gamejams, since it seemed like a promotion for crunch culture
[1:35:49] <KingVantq> @Explodincatz if you didnt do stuff during your first playthrough
[1:35:49] <%phd_in_thuggery> Postgame is so fun
[1:35:58] <%doomerskeletor13> So yeah I forgot, that substory was ok but the substory it leads into is way better
[1:36:00] <%OfficerMods> actually imagine a Japanese studio even acknowledging the concept of crunch
[1:36:04] <ARDM112> Brass Knuckles are in Rush
[1:36:07] <fIashman92> It's just a slideshow of Kiryu not killing people
[1:36:07] <Wofoeh> @WoolieVersus Oh uh, Brass knucks is related to Rush
[1:36:07] <$dudedude55555> essence of ass crushing
[1:36:12] <brunoberserk> ESSENCE OF STABBING
[1:36:16] <brachydios777> New game let‚Äôs you fuckaround more
[1:36:18] <ghoststalker> ESSENCE OF PLIERS
[1:36:21] <%phd_in_thuggery> Essence of Pushing into Car
[1:36:21] <digitalslime> you can use it on premium adventure, can you use it on NG+ as well
[1:36:23] <%Asuterisuku> Pretty sure it was a timing thing.
[1:36:25] <For_Temeria> There are knuckles moves in the rush tree
[1:36:27] <ARDM112> Rush has special heat moves for knuckles
[1:36:28] <DatAsuna> @LastHazzerd Because it's for fun, voluntary and like a competition between friends
[1:36:31] <glaciusinfinite> passed it up
[1:36:32] <servicesuspension> gamejam is not different from speed painting
[1:36:36] <+runegod20> without the heat moves, the only knuckle heat moves you have are for enemies on the ground, which are normal heat moves you can do already
[1:36:37] <%phd_in_thuggery> Essence of Biting the Curb
[1:36:38] <DatAsuna> If you job said you had to do it, that would suck
[1:36:40] <%cobalt_phoenix_> the pole move is on beast right?
[1:36:49] <+Asuterisuku> At least you can repair them now.
[1:36:50] <X2Eliah> Rush -> Weapon Master (Knuckles) ????
[1:36:51] <chainsaw105> rush trainer is right there if we want
[1:36:56] <%krispen_wa> Fuccin Tendo vs Kiryu in Rush, who would win
[1:37:00] <+Zebylth> weapons are literally for heat moves
[1:37:00] <$dudedude55555> ara-q3
[1:37:05] <DatAsuna> But when it's a thing we sign up for and do with our friends it's just like a weekend activity
[1:37:07] <brachydios777> Knuckles are in the rush tree
[1:37:09] <+runegod20> i imagine there's better knuckles with better durability, but the basic kunckles are weak
[1:37:16] <servicesuspension> I say fuck weapons and just give me more punchy kickies
[1:37:18] <Vigogs> that's why you get better weapons from the majima weapon thing
[1:37:23] <DatAsuna> and we get a fun dumb indie game to play at the end
[1:37:25] <+runegod20> but they're cheap so you can get like 3 of them in your inventory for nothing
[1:37:28] <%RyTYoung> I do that too
[1:37:28] <fIashman92> Brass knuckles don't wear down so long as you have less than one bar
[1:37:29] <%krispen_wa> Irrashaimase
[1:37:31] <digitalslime> you can get unbreakable stuff but they aren't very strong
[1:37:35] <valriot> I always felt like in BOTW in encouraged creativity, so it never bothered me at all
[1:37:39] <ARDM112> You can get shitty weapons with infinite durability later through Majima
[1:37:42] <X2Eliah> man, I hate games with weapon durability
[1:37:43] <rcand9> you can get some modded weapons with great durability in 3
[1:37:45] <%phd_in_thuggery> also on the topic of crunch, I once worked 11 hour shifts 6 nights a week for 4 weeks..... and it was my second job ever
[1:37:46] <X2Eliah> it's just busywork
[1:37:52] <akman14> I dont mind durability in F:NV
[1:37:53] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Kiwami 2 fixes it with a skill that repairs any weapon that isn't broken when you switch to a new weapon
[1:37:53] <%big_laser_boss> Woolie needs to find the mushroom seller
[1:37:54] <%OfficerMods> kenka bancho had a good weapon system
[1:38:09] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @phd_in_thuggery how are you alive
[1:38:14] <+Crippl3> ...what era is that
[1:38:21] <+Asuterisuku> Yakuza revels in the stupid.
[1:38:26] <Darren716> YES
[1:38:27] <%OfficerMods> the weapon last forever but your badass goes down as you use it
[1:38:28] <+TheShisno> Zero's durability I like because you can repair what you like and most weapons play different by category.

[2:14:21] <+QueequegTheater> WOOLIE IS EVEN BAD AT SHOOTING IN THIS GAME
[2:14:25] <SherlockianHero> I‚Äôve never seen two Shakedowns in the same place.
[2:14:27] <%big_laser_boss> USE THE QUICK-CHANGE CLOTHES
[2:14:30] <Solidnick18> melted
[2:14:31] <jorniev> WOOLIE MADE A MISTAKE
[2:14:32] <R3c0n31> He absobrs the bullet
[2:14:33] <SereneFox> Legend says that if 2 shakedowns ever meet the universe would collapse in on itself
[2:14:37] <+runegod20> the slimegun falls off a bit in the stronger shakedowns but you can stock like 25 of thyese
[2:14:39] <+TheShisno> Kung-fu Clench going on

[2:15:24] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> @WoolieVersus Please don't be complacent and use slime/zap guns for these guys... :(
[2:15:25] <ARDM112> There is no heat move with photon or any swords
[2:15:29] <Solidnick18> nope
[2:15:30] <+runegod20> i think the photon is counted as a katana, and I don't think kiryu have anything for it
[2:15:30] <+RJay80> maybe not rush style?
[2:15:31] <jorniev> sword?
[2:15:35] <%McSoliace> probably in brawler
[2:15:36] <ARDM112> Hammer + Beast
[2:15:36] <%notsoy> hammer is only in beast
[2:15:37] <jorniev> OOOOH
[2:15:39] <Wofoeh> @WoolieVersus Beast for sledge Heat
[2:15:40] <%Asuterisuku> You're in Rush!
[2:15:41] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> Hammer + Beast
[2:15:42] <jorniev> BEAT
[2:15:47] <+runegod20> some heat moves are also style dependant
[2:15:50] <+QueequegTheater> FUCKING ENDURING

[2:15:56] <Solidnick18> oh he killed you
[2:15:57] <BlackermanZX> WOW
[2:15:57] <%cobalt_phoenix_> hammer is only when knocked down i think
[2:15:57] <R3c0n31> THAT WAS A DEATH, WOW
[2:15:58] <Solidnick18> lol
[2:16:00] <%big_laser_boss> QUICK-CHANGE CLOTHES
[2:16:01] <Medo3G> switch style
[2:16:05] <%BallerSwagBro9k> SPICY KNIFE
[2:16:07] <LVL1_Scumbag> Sacrifce stone OP
[2:16:08] <ghoststalker> You don‚Äôt learn how to use swords well until Kiwami
[2:16:11] <daniphofani> monkaS
[2:16:12] <joshua_42> Believe you have you change styles to do them
[2:16:14] <Blank9> quick change clothes means 0 defense
[2:16:14] <+Trickyvic13> you have to be in brawler i think
[2:16:15] <sonofthedeepsouth> He gon fuck up
[2:16:16] <jorniev> HAMMER ONLY WITH BEAST?
[2:16:16] <DatAsuna> heat moves depend on your style
[2:16:17] <Slim_pickings> Maybe the ball
[2:16:19] <+FxyDEV> kagaamiii~n
[2:16:19] <+Tucker0603> YOU'RE IN RUSH
[2:16:21] <%Asuterisuku> Woolie you need to be in Brawler or Beast.
[2:16:26] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Just keep yelling wrong style until it gets through
[2:16:28] <+runegod20> stun gun does have one
[2:16:30] <DatAsuna> rush style only does knuckles
[2:16:33] <daniphofani> WRONG STYLE
[2:16:35] <mortificent> YOU'RE IN SU
[2:16:36] <user_naim> Switch styles!
[2:16:36] <+QueequegTheater> @jorniev Beast only works with items on the ground
[2:16:37] <X2Eliah> WRONG STYLE FOR HAMMER
[2:16:37] <+TheShisno> Worry about that
[2:16:38] <brunoberserk> woolie change to brawler or beast
[2:16:39] <Darren716> V
[2:16:40] <%big_laser_boss> RUSH LOCKS OUT MOST HEAT MOVES
[2:16:41] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> DONT WORRY ABOUT THAT
[2:16:42] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> switch styles
[2:16:45] <Treyu000> yes, worry about that
[2:16:46] <CoffeeSlice> V
[2:16:47] <DSD24> Don't worry about ti tho
[2:16:49] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> @WoolieVersus Hammer = Beast
[2:16:49] <mortificent> YOU'RE IN RUSH OR NO HEAT
[2:16:51] <daniphofani> v what the fuck
[2:16:51] <+runegod20> some heat weapon heat moves are 100% style dependant
[2:16:52] <+Ornightz> You need Brawler stance to use Heat actions w/ weapons @WoolieVersus
[2:16:52] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> ONLY WORRY ABOUT THAT
[2:16:53] <mesamus> press down on the dpad
[2:16:55] <+QueequegTheater> Oh wait never mind
[2:16:58] <DatAsuna> yes worry about that
[2:17:02] <R3c0n31> V is Holy again
[2:17:02] <%AMUSERNAME> @WoolieVersus Just a reminder, the Quick Change clothes have basically 0 armor, so they can be HARMFUL in Shakedown fights.
[2:17:04] <+Ornightz> or beast
[2:17:09] <+TheShisno> woolieS woolieT
[2:17:12] <+TheShisno> woolieF woolieU
[2:17:13] <andre11dr> V is such a troll, i love it LUL
[2:17:14] <jorniev> nnonoono
[2:17:32] <%big_laser_boss> ALSO CANCEL THE ATTACKS BY CHANGING STYLES MID ANIMATION
[2:17:37] <%jdhwash> Woolie turning this into turn-based combat
[2:17:44] <+QueequegTheater> SHORT SHAKEDOWN
[2:17:45] <DatAsuna> you can just look at your upgrades and check
[2:17:48] <%BallerSwagBro9k> DEAD
[2:17:51] <turbofolk> Fuck HEAD BUSTED
[2:17:54] <%gatorafan> that looked like death
[2:17:54] <%Drunkengen> Are we playing Yakuza 7 already?
[2:17:55] <%Asuterisuku> NOW try the Lightsaber.
[2:17:55] <andre11dr> Isn't Brawlers that has the weapon moves
[2:17:59] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> @WoolieVersus Knuckles = Rush
[2:18:01] <Josef_Stryker> TAZE HIM
[2:18:02] <servicesuspension> chunky salsa rule! that guy is DEAD
[2:18:05] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Oh lord that heat move
[2:18:09] <OblivionSword1> most weapon work with brawler
[2:18:15] <ARDM112> There are no heat actions for swords in 0 because Komaki teaches them in 1
[2:18:16] <+runegod20> knuckles only have unique ones for rush, and there's one or two random unique ones for beast
[2:18:19] <Wofoeh> @WoolieVersus Brass Knucks Heat actions for Rush
[2:18:20] <%Asuterisuku> It's basically just NOT RUSH.
[2:18:22] <R3c0n31> That is so a simple Heat move, that is just scary
[2:18:33] <user_naim> Punisher it
[2:18:35] <ghoststalker> Swords need training in 1 first
[2:18:36] <%big_laser_boss> USE THE QUICK-CHANGE CLOTHES
[2:18:37] <OblivionSword1> there's also bikes you can grab
[2:18:51] <%big_laser_boss> FADC DROP-KICKS
[2:19:00] <%Asuterisuku> Just frame dodging gets you Heat.
[2:19:13] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> Rush + Knuckles
[2:19:19] <user_naim> just Bad Guys, Vile City this punk
[2:19:20] <%big_laser_boss> You can cancel your attacks by swapping styles
[2:19:37] <+runegod20> the one for rush does also require lock on, so it'd be easy to miss
[2:19:39] <%Asuterisuku> Rush + Knuckles requires an upgrade.
[2:19:55] <BlackermanZX> monkaS
[2:19:56] <+RJay80> i know at some point doing the weave in rush style will dodge his attacks
[2:19:58] <%big_laser_boss> Make your attacks safe by style changing
[2:20:08] <Medo3G> I guess that was the back to the wall heat move in rush
[2:20:26] <+QueequegTheater> It really fucks with me that Woolie isn't literally just holding down R1 the entire fight
[2:20:26] <+runegod20> you have to unlock it and it requires a lock on
[2:20:27] <+RJay80> dead?
[2:20:30] <jorniev> oh no
[2:20:32] <+runegod20> which we may or may not have gotten
[2:20:37] <R3c0n31> Here it comes
[2:20:37] <%big_laser_boss> rush has a getup attack
[2:20:40] <OblivionSword1> I think you have brass knuckle heat move for enemy with swords

[2:20:55] <R3c0n31> That is legit instant kills
[2:20:58] <+runegod20> the sword heat move is I think locked to real estate
[2:20:59] <%big_laser_boss> and you can cancel that one for an instant get up
[2:21:02] <Timarkot> Wallet
[2:21:09] <@Solidus_113> You're also using gear with bad defense
[2:21:12] <user_naim> jesus christ mr shakedown
[2:21:15] <turbofolk> Fuck
[2:21:15] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> @QueequegTheater His lifebar is tiny. This isn't % damage y'know...
[2:21:17] <daniphofani> I like how there's ONE lady on the side watching and clapping
[2:21:31] <user_naim> This is turning into a triple homicide on one dude
[2:21:32] <%gatorafan> ThankEgg
[2:21:33] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> Beast Bearhug him@
[2:21:37] <%McSoliace> when you don't have space you should probably lock on and dodge
[2:21:45] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus It doesn't matter, stomp 1HKO's you at full health
[2:21:46] <servicesuspension> That happens in the movie
[2:21:49] <servicesuspension> I shit you not
[2:21:50] <djblue_shift> just like skyrim lol
[2:21:51] <%big_laser_boss> @solidus_113 He needs to utilize the Quick-change clothes
[2:21:57] <andre11dr> Switch to Brawlers and blade him
[2:21:58] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> Beast L1+O
[2:21:59] <%jonblnt> it looks like there's more space at the crossroad of the street
[2:22:05] <KillMyPast> Quick change with Brawler is godlike
[2:22:05] <+Idziman> Staminan Royales are the cheese wheels of Kamurocho
[2:22:08] <Medo3G> time for the classic I guess
[2:22:10] <+QueequegTheater> HOLD R1
[2:22:16] <digitalslime> Knuckles requirer a skill i think
[2:22:16] <jotabranded> just wait for him to attack close to a wall.. 50% just there
[2:22:20] <ARDM112> There are no sword heat moves in this. Kiryu gets taught swordsmanship in 1 and Majima sticks to the bat.
[2:22:20] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:22:21] <%dukenux> he still has a full meter going on
[2:22:22] <digitalslime> for rush
[2:22:25] <%big_laser_boss> STYLE CHANGE TO CANCEL RECOVERY
[2:22:28] <OblivionSword1> not the best arena for mr shakedown
[2:22:36] <jorniev> Seriously the business quest is important so you don't mind losing to these guys
[2:22:37] <turbofolk> heavy breathing woolie is feeling the heat
[2:22:45] <+runegod20> our quick steps are good enough that we don't have to be unlocked for good dodges
[2:22:49] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Yes you can, lock on
[2:22:53] <+QueequegTheater> and stay locked
[2:22:55] <$dudedude55555> you need zap guns my dude
[2:22:56] <%big_laser_boss> YOU CAN CANEL BY CHANGING STYLES
[2:22:57] <KillMyPast> I feel like Woolie still doesnt understand what the point of Quick Change is
[2:23:04] <X2Eliah> oh jeez this is rough
[2:23:05] <djblue_shift> does anyone hear dmc3 dante when he charges lol
[2:23:06] <%Asuterisuku> Using Rush here is really messing with him.
[2:23:09] <%Lion_kun> Something Something Zap Gun
[2:23:13] <Karego_at> I get so fuckin nervous with these combos!!!
[2:23:17] <+Damie904> Woolie's played DMC, he fucking better understand the point of it.

[3:00:34] <majindusto> V is going So White he's gonna be Transparent
[3:00:34] <%doughvatkyn> i want a scene with kiryu wrapping his fists with cash
[3:00:38] <%big_laser_boss> @woolieversus The description for the Quick-change clothes are lies. They don't speed up your style changing animation. They let you CANEL anny attack animation by changing style. The style-changing already comes with a hefty slow down to enemies so it's practically free. Think of it as a FADC from SF4
[3:00:38] <enerkaizer> woolie is loaded
[3:00:40] <%Grimlockfly> @big_laser_boss they need to bowl with bowling alley manager
[3:00:45] <fIashman92> I'm pretty sure the music video can only be filmed in the daytime

[3:01:38] <%cobalt_phoenix_> they just need to bump into the people on the beef bowl area
[3:01:48] <chainsaw105> the trick now is to stay locked on and simply dodge out of the way of charges and shoot when the opportunity arises
[3:01:56] <Mattais88> Unless he's leaning against a wall
[3:02:03] <anarchistPastry> its like chasing roaming legendary pokemon
[3:02:06] <%doomerskeletor13> Yeah it‚Äôs like next to the beef bowl place on the right
[3:02:13] <+Captbutt> what was the last story quest that they did?

[3:17:31] <Prevot> I suck ass at rhythm games and even I can do this
[3:17:41] <DatAsuna> The rhythm game in 5 is my fave, that one's basically the miku games sega also makes
[3:17:42] <%Asuterisuku> Woolie, how do you feel about Theatrythm?
[3:17:44] <andre11dr> How was Pat better at this? I'd think Woolie would be better
[3:17:47] <user_naim> You can do it on reaction, in a way
[3:17:47] <BabblingBayou> eh, you'll get used to it
[3:17:49] <%chosenjuan42> We must Bowl
[3:17:51] <heart_ablaze> man why is woolie so bad at this thing he's new to?
[3:17:52] <%Grimlockfly> the sidequests in this one are strong
[3:17:54] <%big_laser_boss> I do hope they do the telephone club minigame. Both for COMPO, content and singers
[3:17:55] <+QueequegTheater> Mostly miss
[3:17:57] <Darren716> andre11dr Because Pat just presses buttons
[3:18:00] <pi_in_the_sci> getting good at outrun is annoying

[3:18:14] <DatAsuna> Kiwami is the worst because you feel forced to do every minigame
[3:18:15] <jotabranded> the best sidequests are in 6 imo
[3:18:15] <+MajorCrasher> telephone club when?

[3:19:09] <%Asuterisuku> This quest is great.
[3:19:11] <enerkaizer> I still think its wild that japan actually passed laws specifically because of Dragon quest releases. SE for example isn't allowed to release new DQ games on any other day then saturday (No joke)
[3:19:11] <DatAsuna> There's aplayable baby mod
[3:19:13] <%Grimlockfly> gottdamn it pat, stop stealing from children
[3:19:20] <%Asuterisuku> I am CERTAIN that Ichiban was in that line.

[3:19:51] <iswearimjustdandy> Wait does chat not know about this one
[3:19:53] <rcand9> i feel like the writer had his console stolen like maybe a purple gameboy color?
[3:19:53] <OblivionSword1> Except Kiryu cry a lot in the series
[3:19:56] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus V, Ichiban was 11 in 1988, he was totally in that line with this kid
[3:19:57] <CharlieDJohnson> afaik its not an actual law, just something they joked about, but it just happens that they also abide by this non-existing law because why not
[3:19:58] <jorniev> THIS IS WHY WOOLIE is playing this GAME
[3:19:58] <skyentombment> CLOSE YOUR HEART BOY
[3:19:59] <Afroperonista> it's not exactly manly tbh

[3:25:01] <Prevot> why is woolie trying to use weapons in Beast
[3:25:04] <+runegod20> i'm pretty sure there's no heat moves based on ranged weapons like that

[3:25:05] <+cloudman_exe> Brawler...
[3:25:05] <%dukenux> Pfffft
[3:25:06] <servicesuspension> geddit?
[3:25:06] <%big_laser_boss> @woolieversus The description for the Quick-change clothes are lies. They don't speed up your style changing animation. They let you CANEL anny attack animation by changing style. The style-changing already comes with a hefty slow down to enemies so it's practically free. Think of it as a FADC from SF4
[3:25:07] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> dat kid run
[3:25:08] <ManlyMcBeefington> most item heat moves are on Brawler
[3:25:08] <Darren716> Stomped, goombah

[3:37:54] <%SouLucha> At this point idk why Woolie is even surprised anymore.
[3:37:55] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL

[3:40:46] <Reveresao> A guy got jail time for a 3D printed one
[3:40:49] <Timarkot> fucked up for not using guns?
[3:40:52] <Darren716> People literally get sent to prison in this series for HAVING guns
[3:40:53] <+MajorCrasher> now if you take everything as real life serious, then Kiryu has killed and permanently maimed so many people
[3:40:56] <%wibbwobbler> so close Kappa

[3:45:31] <alvaroeltz> Ok but what does it do in trickster?
[3:45:31] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 45 minutes
[3:45:33] <user_naim> Not the most obvious
[3:45:38] <%captaincarl10> the lighter sucks damage wise but it blasts fire out
[3:45:47] <hkgamingtv> "Pistol whip"

[3:46:39] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> Noticing lots of backseat gaming in the chat.

[3:46:40] <zhenthrim213> GUNFLAME
[3:46:40] <hkgamingtv> Fun but weak
[3:46:41] <%Javaa01> But yeah the damage is shit and you only get 10 shots with no heat move
[3:46:43] <%dukenux> they take being set on fire like champs
[3:46:46] <%Javaa01> So it's poopy
[3:46:47] <%Asuterisuku> You can get some sick juggles with that.
[3:46:50] <nottotallyoriginal> We sure that's not a flamethrower
[3:46:50] <%cobalt_phoenix_> now knock someone down and use the hammer
[3:46:51] <servicesuspension> this only proves even more that yakuza was always an rpg
[3:47:23] <OblivionSword1> it is an attack 10 weapon
[3:47:24] <%dukenux> my cousin
[3:47:25] <hkgamingtv> Bowel Ling

[4:01:20] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus If you want a list of all heat moves, press Y when in the level up screen/sphere grid. It's not ideal but the text descriptions under "Heat Actions" will say required weapons, the colour of the "1st/2nd/3rd" icon on the right indicate the style/heat level. later games do the list a bit better than this one.

[4:07:56] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1359058937946009600?s=19
[4:07:58] <%cobalt_phoenix_> NOT DEAD
[4:08:02] <majindusto> "Face Twist"
[4:08:06] <hkgamingtv> Never Killed ANYONE
[4:08:26] <AngryAsian5> That dude's neck is strong AF
[4:08:29] <ShamrockSamurai2628> Yo Woolie and mills what‚Äôs good?
[4:08:34] <%cobalt_phoenix_> the nails are here...
[4:08:34] <hkgamingtv> Brawler Style OP
[4:08:37] <andre11dr> Also this is one of the best songs easily
[4:08:45] <+QueequegTheater> That's so ridiculous
[4:08:49] <%notsoy> weapon heat moves also ignore blocking
[4:08:51] <%Asuterisuku> Damage is scaled by repeated use, that includes in this tutorial.
[4:09:03] <+QueequegTheater> UWOOLIE
[4:09:06] <CoffeeSlice> WOOLIE
[4:09:07] <OblivionSword1> next time
[4:09:07] <+Tucker0603> DAMN IT WOOLZ
[4:09:08] <%big_laser_boss> This one is really easy to trigger if you style-change to brawl mid attack when they block
[4:09:09] <Afroperonista> why...
[4:09:11] <majindusto> GOD DAMMIT WOOLIE
[4:09:11] <+QueequegTheater> YOU HAVE HEAT ITEMS
[4:09:12] <Ecliptic_Origins> the box of nails monkaS
[4:09:12] <%captaincarl10> Woolie please
[4:09:13] <SteelSnake93101> DAMN IT
[4:09:14] <DatAsuna> iirc it respawns between fights
[4:09:15] <NotHereToStream> you can drop it with down on the dpad
[4:09:16] <%captaincarl10> you had no heat
[4:09:17] <ghoststalker> DAMMIT
[4:09:17] <%cobalt_phoenix_> next time, just load the area
[4:09:18] <rcand9> never killed anyone
[4:09:21] <user_naim> God damnit
[4:09:24] <user_naim> what a waste
[4:09:33] <$dudedude55555> take a bike
[4:09:36] <DatAsuna> so you can just do it on the next guy
[4:09:53] <GarbageNirvana> Does he not have lock on for this fight?
[4:09:54] <Wofoeh> For those curious, the name of this song is "La Di Da"
[4:09:59] <+QueequegTheater> Kiryu where are you looking
[4:09:59] <GarbageNirvana> Weird
[4:10:05] <%Asuterisuku> 3rd Gear
[4:10:06] <jorniev> get some distance befor taunting
[4:10:06] <%cobalt_phoenix_> need heat 3
[4:10:17] <%jonblnt> when you're one on one are you locking on?
[4:10:17] <$dudedude55555> don't repeat heat moves, they get less effective
[4:10:22] <DatAsuna> there are no half bar moves
[4:10:34] <+runegod20> was about to say, half bar seems wrong
[4:10:42] <Karego_at> just grab something from the floor dammit
[4:10:43] <KaiserMario> You can also grab during blocks...
[4:10:47] <majindusto> Half Bars DO NOT EXIST
[4:10:52] <hkgamingtv> Habs are going down tonight
[4:11:02] <DatAsuna> you can just smash him with a bike too
[4:11:08] <$dudedude55555> NotLikeThis
[4:11:12] <%Asuterisuku> Damage isn't great on the 5th use.
[4:11:14] <heylookitswex> try using some of the items sitting around
[4:11:20] <brunoberserk> NotLikeThis
[4:11:26] <Prevot> woolie forgot about grabbing
[4:11:39] <Prevot> too much rush style I guess
[4:11:39] <%McSoliace> Let him learn chat....
[4:11:40] <%jonblnt> Woolie's gonna Woolie woolieSPICE
[4:11:41] <majindusto> Hmmmm, Itens
[4:11:42] <%Asuterisuku> @Prevot He only uses Rush, why would he grab?
[4:11:45] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> It's okay people, he's just labbing.
[4:11:52] <majindusto> *items
[4:11:52] <Karego_at> there are a bunch of good garbage cans right there
[4:11:53] <+runegod20> on top of raising heat, keeping it form going down is just as important
[4:11:57] <DatAsuna> @McSoliace the thing is even if he learns, he'll forget next week lol
[4:11:59] <ShamrockSamurai2628> ResidentSleeper
[4:11:59] <%captaincarl10> all these items available
[4:12:00] <user_naim> Could throw him

[4:12:12] <hkgamingtv> Habs are going DOWN tonight
[4:12:14] <+QueequegTheater> Kickboy > Kiryu
[4:12:22] <HedgehogGames1> But STYLE
[4:12:22] <$dudedude55555> @WoolieVersus repeating heat moves makes them less effective
[4:12:22] <OblivionSword1> Akiyama taunts
[4:12:22] <valriot> Akiyama <3

[4:15:35] <+runegod20> Wouldn‚Äôt V saying that you play characters outside of kiryu be more of a spoiler?
[4:15:36] <+QueequegTheater> @dudedude55555 no
[4:15:39] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @dudedude55555 some anime guy that does youtube stuff
[4:15:43] <Karego_at> right??
[4:15:51] <%dukenux> ProZD is that guy that looks kinda like Lysanderoth
[4:15:51] <OblivionSword1> V is good
[4:15:54] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @exnuart but you don't know who else is playing these games, you dick
[4:15:58] <+RJay80> t101Wink t101Wink
[4:16:02] <%McSoliace> @runegod20 he's already played majima.....
[4:16:03] <majindusto> Names can be spoilers

[4:16:23] <SteelSnake93101> Kappa
[4:16:23] <majindusto> "Ethically"
[4:16:23] <akman14> This aint dollars tho

[4:16:30] <rcand9> LUL
[4:16:30] <somedude1013> *cough*
[4:16:30] <+jiggy_snipe> it's not dollars but ok
[4:16:35] <joshua_42> Literally a better Mr. Shakedown
[4:16:37] <Mattais88> It's all owned by the chicken
[4:16:39] <xbb1024> if you make a compelling enough product, sure
[4:16:51] <majindusto> Sigh
[4:16:57] <+runegod20> We easily could have collected like at least 6 more times this stream, it amazing how fast it goes when you upgrade it
[4:16:57] <hkgamingtv> buy some lower tier moves
[4:16:58] <servicesuspension> it's not dollars. It was probably more valuable than dollars at that time
[4:17:06] <%Asuterisuku> More heat is nice to have.
[4:17:07] <majindusto> enigmaDone
[4:17:12] <DatAsuna> btw press Y on this screen for that heat move weapon list you wanted
[4:17:14] <%McSoliace> snatching strike is good in general
[4:17:19] <+runegod20> Health might be worth it to not get dunked on by shakedown
[4:17:26] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> If you invest in only ethical businesses and/or make a good business that treats its employees well, yes, you can. But it's hard.
[4:17:32] <%big_laser_boss> snatching strike is good
[4:17:33] <%Asuterisuku> Snatching Strike is free in 0, it just requires that you're in Heated state.
[4:17:33] <+Trickyvic13> theres a rush move that helps you quickly get back up when knocked down
[4:17:36] <alvaroeltz> finish the bacchus training theres a good move for shakedown there
[4:17:37] <+QueequegTheater> HEALTH
[4:17:38] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> Being unethical is easier, unfortunately.
[4:17:39] <user_naim> Man watching these makes me want to write a Bad Guys appreciation thread
[4:17:39] <Monkeyweed21> save your money for the next part of real estate
[4:17:42] <%Asuterisuku> In Kiwami, they made it cost Heat.
[4:17:48] <hkgamingtv> you're gonna want to invest in your businesses some more so don't overspend here
[4:17:53] <%big_laser_boss> Quick-change clothes help a lot
[4:18:01] <+runegod20> Not getting 1 shot would help alot
[4:18:18] <@Squdnate> @WoolieVersus This message is to V if noticed - I can recommend going to story with Oda, as it unlocks all available subquest for kiryu without going too forward

[4:35:03] <Iniudan> @Karego_at Rush is good once you have the upgrade that you dodge while hit.

[4:37:08] <%cache_22> Is the Empty Lot like a place where you do Pocket Racing?
[4:37:15] <%ChoculaUltra> dammit Awano. Stop being so stylish while you're being such a smarmy douche.
[4:37:22] <ghostravens> the empty lot is actually the kiln of the first flame
[4:37:23] <RyuShinden> But Pocket Circuit is the REAL main quest tho D:
[4:37:31] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
[4:37:34] <Monkeyweed21> why is the game so quiet?
[4:37:44] <Karego_at> awano is so quiet :'D
[4:37:45] <hkgamingtv> Yakuza has so many REAL YAKUZA parts
[4:37:54] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> So Kingdom Hearts
[4:37:59] <BerryliciousDefinition> Yeah it is kinda quiet
[4:37:59] <servicesuspension> That comparison fucking hurts

[4:38:20] <hkgamingtv> yeah right Awano, ya fucking slime
[4:38:22] <Iniudan> @QueequegTheater Not really as cannot keep as much presure with other style at least on boss, as other style require you to block or dodge away, rush you just keep the pressure while waving hit away.
[4:38:24] <@akuda_bar> who framed roger rabbit
[4:38:26] <servicesuspension> Kiryu is just too perfect to be real
[4:38:35] <RyuShinden> LOOKS AT THE SUIT THO
[4:38:49] <servicesuspension> Kiryu's suit is fucking awful
[4:38:53] <%kewlmyc> Yeah audio is pretty damn low right now

[4:39:18] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> and thats whats so powerful about it
[4:39:21] <%gatorafan> Family-family-family

[4:39:26] <majindusto> Game Audio too low :(
[4:39:31] <ghostravens> game's really quiet
[4:39:35] <%cache_22> Yakuza games are like Fast and Furious movies.
[4:39:35] <+RJay80> friends only exist to do heat moves with
[4:39:39] <jorniev> UNLESS YOU PULL A KAISER SOZE

[4:42:12] <%ekodrop> yoshiki's crystal piano
[4:42:13] <iswearimjustdandy> The true cost of acoustic pianos is fucking tuning them for real
[4:42:19] <%cobalt_phoenix_> nah it's still good I think, just this scene is quieter than the last
[4:42:37] <$dudedude55555> a gun
[4:42:38] <%ChoculaUltra> hell yeah, you gotta schedule an appointment and shit and the piano masters show up to tune your shit like a surgery
[4:42:40] <%ChoculaUltra> its kinda wild
[4:42:45] <yeeyeyee> yeah most people who own grand pianos either rent them out for use or are millionaire concert pianists
[4:42:46] <Karego_at> :)))))
[4:42:46] <servicesuspension> HE HAS ENERGY POWERS
[4:42:47] <+Euphbugg> Euphbugg subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[4:42:52] <Prevot> he probably has a hidden gun on his fake arm
[4:42:54] <+Mendin> Quick research reveals: The 97-key grand piano has an extra octave on the low-side, and circa late 70s was priced around 35k american (translates to 150kish USD in current prices)
[4:42:55] <OblivionSword1> Chat questions will Woolie ever get the "Style" ??

[5:09:09] <%Javaa01> Well luckily we are almost done with shakedown storylines
[5:09:10] <+Sajallday> We want the long
[5:09:11] <+duichenko> Imagine cuts to the manga
[5:09:12] <FirewallStorm> Noooo it great
[5:09:13] <DatAsuna> lowkey editing ruined the tbfp yakuza 4 lp at the end
[5:09:16] <Monkeyweed21> Do shogi and Mahjong offscreen
[5:09:20] <%Javaa01> So that's something that can almost be done off stream
[5:09:20] <mrblack499> yakuza 0 is like over 80 hours so have fun
[5:09:22] <%threeheadedwalrus> threeheadedwalrus subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! Essence of Subscription
[5:09:22] <Mahbonk> Take your time
[5:09:23] <+RawrzorsGrrr> I‚Äôm behind Woolie but still up to 80 hours
[5:09:23] <hkgamingtv> I stayed back for KOTOR but I'm 100% here for this!

[5:09:33] <majindusto> NOTHING IS OFFSCREEN...NO CUTS!!!
[5:09:35] <@Solidus_113> Shakedowns taking 10 minutes each is a little rough
[5:09:46] <BerryliciousDefinition> Free real estate
[5:09:53] <DatAsuna> yeah stuff like that assassin taking ages was a bit rough
[5:09:56] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Free moves is hilarious content on jobbers
[5:10:02] <OblivionSword1> tbf Shakedown is scary to fihgt
[5:10:04] <SomersaultJustice> set real estate, play mahjong, collect money, repeat
[5:10:09] <OblivionSword1> fight
[5:10:11] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I found a way to double ass buster people
[5:10:13] <Darren716> I feel real estate, friendships, and shakedown, and move tutors can be off screen
[5:10:21] <+Homebutton33> thats fair
[5:10:21] <%big_laser_boss> Learn to use the Quick-change clothes. Then Shakedown becomes styling showcase
[5:10:22] <Darren716> Except the final parts of each real estate
[5:10:30] <xbb1024> V should try dreadlocks
[5:10:31] <MelBrooksKA> Yak 0 was one of the longest LPs on the old channels, this is going to be a long one whether you cut corners or not
[5:10:33] <DatAsuna> Ubisoft games have that problem but it sucks, yakuza games make it mostly a good problem
[5:10:33] <mrblack499> not such a thing
[5:10:34] <Mahbonk> much much shorter games
[5:10:34] <hkgamingtv> You don't have to go Jirard Khalili on it but there's LOTS you should do
[5:10:35] <%Chatterbox1991> The Red Dead 2 problem
[5:10:35] <rafflespaddock> too much?? hahahaha laughs in Yakuza 5
[5:10:36] <%Javaa01> If you think this has too much game in the game, by god is 5 gonna be a shock to you
[5:10:39] <%wibbwobbler> LUL
[5:10:41] <fIashman92> But when's more Shogi and Mahjong doh?
[5:10:42] <Mattais88> Not Hyrule Warriors levels, thnak god
[5:10:42] <OblivionSword1> 0 has so much stuffs
[5:10:44] <%cobalt_phoenix_> so 0 is the only one with all that content?
[5:10:45] <Mahbonk> 5 though...
[5:10:49] <%Javaa01> 5 is literally the "eat up piggy" of the franchise
[5:10:51] <servicesuspension> Yakuza 0 Kiryu Version and Majima Version for Gameboy Advance
[5:10:52] <+TrevSmith222> Once you have a quick way to take out Shakedown, and the Deep Pockets perk, money doesn't mean anything.
[5:10:52] <$dudedude55555> no, they all have a lot of content
[5:10:54] <turbofolk> Persona, yakuza, hyrule warriors
[5:10:56] <Mahbonk> 7 as well. But it aint surprising for a JRPG
[5:10:58] <@Solidus_113> LUL that video
[5:10:59] <Potatoidea> Oh no
[5:10:59] <DatAsuna> this is from pre-stream
