[0:09:43] <captainthunderwolf> This is a weird take, but I'll find it genuinely unnerving if the Lickers have buttholes but none of the zombie dogs do, given that Japanese devs always give dogs buttholes and it would be really insidious for only the Lickers to have b-holes.
[0:09:44] <+TheHeroAppears> yeah woolie if you die more you will be better
[0:09:45] <The_Swedish_X> That sounds actually dumb

[0:34:47] <+legendfather_of_giants> keyboard is not fantastic here
[0:34:48] <lloyddboy> there's some sick m+kb runs out there
[0:34:48] <%thetrashman_sc> imagine playing a 3rd person game with a mouse
[0:34:48] <SomeDwarf> PC is the best version because of the 10,000 FPS red hot knife

[0:34:51] <+SirFailsAlott> play with m+kb it's so much better
[0:34:51] <Ballthios> I prefer controller, but keyboard + mouse seems fine
[0:34:52] <$Superdandy96> I agree
[0:34:54] <AgentTexes> Pc with KB&M
[0:34:54] <PayneBlack> i mean, that'd be the best way
[0:34:54] <keyworthe> i played on the pc with a switch pro controller
[0:34:58] <+Eightesu> the nintendo SWITCH DUH
[0:34:58] <+Zayasu> quicksave monkaS
[0:35:01] <FiendishlyInventive> Pat is correct
[0:35:02] <%RioGascar> This game is awful on KB&M
[0:35:02] <stubbyharbinger2u> play on the game cube with a sandwich
[0:35:03] <+thebonebard> i actually was going to recommend pc with controller, i think controller adds a fun level of difficulty
[0:35:06] <Spagheddies> You should play on the Switch with a Famicom controller.
[0:35:08] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Play it with a Playstation Move
[0:35:11] <MrScottKennedy> This pace is perfect because I can go check on my food and not miss anything.

[0:35:31] <reinbachthe3rd> Play it on Steam with a Guitar Hero controller.
[0:35:31] <+Jetsfantasy> I play controller for most of the game, but switch to KB/M for doggos or challenge modes
[0:35:33] <+Eightesu> @furiousfurioso His arm did

[0:59:40] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> PAT WAS WRONG
[0:59:40] <%dirtygaijin> @ArtThouBored You mean Montreal?
[0:59:43] <captainthunderwolf> A flashbang going off in anyone's mouth should fucking KILL them, by the way.
[0:59:43] <unlimited_osteopath> are they in Woolie's house? Why is Pat absorbing that couch??
[0:59:44] <Guardiansaiyan> @ArtThouBored Remake 3 should have it since it spans the city unlike RE2
[0:59:47] <captainthunderwolf> That is a GRENADE, dude.
[0:59:47] <timetraveller2000> Encumbrance is the cause of all our problems Kappa
[0:59:47] <ranarath> @AgentTexes Stupidity. The C-virus
[0:59:48] <ahbhajit> the delay when you put the grenade in is so you can shoot it for more potent boom
[0:59:50] <Graxe_> Man, if Woolie had to deal with Ink Ribbons on top of all of this like the old games.
[0:59:50] <stubbyharbinger2u> 6 is where Leon is a mopey boring twat
[0:59:50] <Jarvanii> dogs react the same was as people when you shove one in them
[0:59:51] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> You only need the knife
[0:59:51] <scrubviewer> woolie too many items

[0:59:53] <+crown_clown22> Pat tell woolie to use the key pls
[0:59:59] <peachy996> I want the Forest and Mansion included in the layout
[1:00:02] <HitchhikingThrough> @captainthunderwolf yeah you know what else should kill them? BULLETS
[1:00:06] <%itsjustdoogan> I be back, bring back COOKIES
[1:00:07] <Corporate_Redeemer> Shooting them will affect multiple but letting them detonating on their own will only affect the one enemy
[1:00:10] <$Superdandy96> I can’t believe Pat and Woolie live in a Alt reality Raccoon City
[1:00:11] <+nitsuji94> store the fucking key
[1:00:11] <StrangeCoincidence> What do you get when Pat and Woolie fusion? "Poolie"? "Wat"?
[1:00:12] <KingVantq> @AgentTexes its set after 5 is all i remember

[1:00:30] <stubbyharbinger2u> @bardicfire no
[1:00:30] <captainthunderwolf> @Youwereeatenbyalid Not wrong, but a flashbang would literally remove their head, which is more of the idea.
[1:00:31] <+Answer_Moose> @bardicfire that'd be neat
[1:00:35] <Guardiansaiyan> @FrustratedAF he didn't tell him for our amusement

[1:31:01] <The_Introspector> Woolie likes Attache case because it reminds him of Tetris.

[1:43:46] <FirearmsInstructor> @WoolieVersus you quick tap every time the "climbing staircase" animation / walk cycle starts or is about to start. It's slow compared to the "tap" to start the aim animation and you "glide" up / down stairs.

[1:45:24] <%SirGO0SE> maybe its a leftover from the mueseum
[1:45:25] <ManfredA> gotta do laundry somewhere mang
[1:45:26] <%Eightesu> it was an art museum
[1:45:27] <Corporate_Redeemer> @kitsunemanami Because the game randomizes the amount of ammo you get based on your performance. Woolie is doing really poorly in combat and wastes ammo, thus the game inflates the number of bullets he gets
[1:45:27] <The_Introspector> You can't miss X unless you glitch the game.
[1:45:29] <%QueequegTheater> @Sitinomi But Woolie still hasn't opened the car trunk tho Kappa
[1:45:29] <%Th3SmartAlec> Puzzle time
[1:45:31] <natebud> That's why the saves are 400 MB Kappa
[1:45:36] <clockworkyokai> play us a tune woolie
[1:45:36] <+Jukku> I work for a fire dept and we have a linen room. when you have bunks you have to be able to do the laundry
[1:45:38] <nobknee> @WoolieVersus Hey Pat, tell Woolie to give KOTOR 2 on steam a look. I won't expect him to stream it, I just think he'd enjoy it. And the steam version is great, full of modern updates, resolutions, steam workshop, et cetera.
[1:45:40] <jessicaamado> Green is not a creative color PAT morfDerp
[1:45:46] <JustTossedMyCoin999> Man those 400 mB saves tho

[1:49:25] <+connos_procrastination> i dunno leon is pretty powerful
[1:49:25] <peachy996> He'd trust a person turning into a zombie and then get bit

[1:51:58] <$Superdandy96> Re2 and Re3 happen around the same time right?
[1:51:59] <nobknee> How come Capcom always wants to change the faces of their characters? You'd think they'd just have Leon look like a younger version of himself in RE4 for RE2 remake.
[1:51:59] <DirtyPopcornJ> @ThatGuyfromMars Budget cuts? If that actually WAS a feature, that would make that keypad cost MORE. Then again, Irons and Umbrella so I wouldn't be surprised.

[2:34:09] <+Vivaciousx3> he does tho
[2:34:10] <Juriisbestwaifu> imagine Nemesis
[2:34:11] <Supmotto> he teleports when you get the jack
[2:34:11] <+Twichty> Where the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?
[2:34:12] <ManfredA> @Ellie_Eyegore kinda actually, he can hear runs and slammed doors, shots, and enemies being triggered even
[2:34:12] <scrubviewer> imagine if he runs like nemesis
[2:34:12] <xavior1993> only if you are far away
[2:34:14] <sislord> he kinda teleports
[2:34:15] <Gigigear21 > Q U I C K B O I
[2:34:15] <madogod> another 5 sec then wooly woyuldve been stuck in that room with him
[2:34:15] <silvcrest> He CAN teleport though
[2:34:15] <MyNameIsRasus> He gives you a decisive pummeling
[2:34:15] <+Tyler_Ruins_Games> He does teleport a liiiitle
[2:34:16] <mercado94> Hes wavedashing
[2:34:17] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> Z A P P

[2:34:22] <+legendfather_of_giants> he does teleport if youre far away
[2:34:25] <%tank7013> He does teleport but you've gotta get real far away first
[2:34:25] <royalxblood> NO DETAIL
[2:34:25] <majindusto> NEMESIS would be BONKERS
[2:34:27] <Metii_Morst> not "technically" teleporting. he's still moving at extremely fast speed when you're not in an adjacent room
[2:34:28] <%Eightesu> imagine Mr X with the Ai of the xenomorph from Isolation
[2:34:29] <%Keyd00d> nope LUL
[2:34:29] <SunsetJack> I thought he teleported when Max played on hardcore?
[2:34:31] <BelMadness> Motherfucker, stop lying. He fucking teleports.
[2:34:32] <Spagheddies> Mr X never teleports. Now, at certain points, after certain triggers are triggered, a second Mr X temporarily spawns in.
[2:34:34] <Ner234> Does Pat know about the bug where TWO Mr. X can spawn?
[2:34:35] <zdracpr> Can someone hook me up with a 2k19 twitch prime code Pleasee
[2:34:35] <ScreamLord> @WoolieVersus It is possible to hide from in areas where you have no flashlight out. I was able to loose him in the library
[2:34:35] <%s_xylocalsingles> woolieLORE

[2:34:36] <+generalve> STOMP STOMP STOMP STOMP
[2:34:38] <timetraveller2000> X with the speed run tech. Liam would be proud.
[2:34:38] <ManfredA> he only teleports at scripted points
[2:34:38] <OkamiDude15> he hears the sound of your cheeks clapping cuz leons dummy thick
[2:34:40] <+PenmanLupine> GPS rounds weren't a thing in '98
[2:34:41] <@Solidus_113> @Guardiansaiyan I don't need to, I'm downloading the VOD and editing it for WoolieVersus
[2:34:41] <%Th3SmartAlec> Dire and Straizo
[2:34:41] <sislord> nemesis would be broken
[2:34:42] <+Twichty> Have that S.T.A.Rz in the cut, where the wood at?Oh, them S.T.A.R.z actin up?!? Where the wolves at?
[2:34:42] <+Ellie_Eyegore> Schrodinger's X

[2:34:56] <MyNameIsRasus> THE INVINCIBLE KICK
[2:34:57] <MayorRev> you already have a GPS it's called STOMP STOMP STOMP
[2:34:59] <+TomServal> @eddiemayfly That's amazing, he calls in a double.

[2:35:37] <BelMadness> >walks at snail pace >"no he doesnt teleport tho" fuck outta town
[2:35:39] <+RelaxedPizza> DMX, Professor X and Tyrant are the only three Mr. Xs
[2:35:40] <@mothmandraws> Mod to let him mood in pauses

[2:35:47] <Apocalypse1950> NO. That was proven to be a hoax.
[2:35:47] <+badchoice5> When a Mr X and a Mrs X love each other VERY much
[2:35:48] <ashuckel> the difference between pat's runthrough and woolies is just astonishing
[2:35:49] <+YouGotCheddared> Mr X is gonna give me a phobia of big huge bald men

[2:36:30] <+ThatGuyfromMars> oh man I hope the surprise happens here
[2:36:31] <sileo_patronus> Pat likes the word outrageous
[2:36:31] <%QueequegTheater> Mr. XXX

[2:37:00] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Looks like a combination
[2:37:01] <%tank7013> Hey look another room that makes Leon A make no sense
[2:37:01] <+badchoice5> Time is stopped, but remember, Mr X is even stronger than TIME ITSELF
[2:37:04] <+Zeiss_Schreiber> @YouGotCheddared He only push them aside

[2:37:41] <scrubviewer> go back upstairs where he wonders around
[2:37:46] <%Th3SmartAlec> "What does this mean!?"
[2:37:47] <MyNameIsRasus> In time, you will know the tragic extent of Umbrella's failures...
[2:37:50] <BelMadness> Pat should just say X can be killed so Woolie wastes what few bullets he has left
[2:37:50] <%ChoculaUltra> Justin Hanson, the boldest thief in the RE universe ever?
[2:37:50] <+khalcipher> Emote jail is the best tho
[2:37:52] <+TomServal> @deaconbluesclues Kleptomania is strong.
[2:37:52] <%Eightesu> a box!
[2:37:55] <timetraveller2000> I think the AB scenarios are straight up parallel universe shit in the remake. To many plot holes.

[2:39:37] <ManfredA> this room is fun in Claire's route
[2:39:37] <%itsjustdoogan> Traps are gay
[2:39:40] <spinningchurro> Pat using chat as a crutch to pretend he has perfect knowledge of the game. DONT THINK I DIDNT NOTICE PAT
[2:39:44] <Juriisbestwaifu> ass was pounded too hard that he was bleeding
[2:39:46] <%QueequegTheater> @itsjustdoogan So what
[2:39:47] <+Omegaanimus> Where are the zombies who were zombie fetishists and look like they were REALLY excited when they got killed?
[2:39:50] <Plutt_bug> This is a weird Claire skin
[2:39:53] <scrubviewer> tipping stomp man intensifies
[2:39:54] <The_Butterfly_Man> I thought he was going to go use the car key earlier?
[2:39:56] <+RadiantBurrito> @itsjustdoogan That's what makes them so good 👀
[2:39:56] <possumwalsh1221> Pat the cheater
[2:39:58] <MarylandJutsu> @itsjustdoogan heres that attention you ordered
[2:39:59] <@Solidus_113> Kool Aid Man memes should come back
[2:40:00] <+Tyler_Ruins_Games> Now just calmly proceed through the station, obviously.
[2:40:01] <sislord> knock knock
[2:40:06] <%QueequegTheater> @The_Butterfly_Man LUL
[2:40:07] <+freeizone> this is what's left of zapping rip
[2:40:09] <ishotmattday> massively cool
[2:40:11] <%tank7013> So chat what do you think the over-under is on those busted walls in the shower area being Nemesis?
[2:40:11] <The_Introspector> Only one way out.
[2:40:11] <+DeaconBluesClues> @Omegaanimus at the con 4 blocks over
[2:40:14] <timetraveller2000> If X had a catchphrase what would it be? I think it would be “...” Kappa
[2:40:16] <%FriendStaffen> Man it sure would suck if Mr. X came down that hallway wouldn't it
[2:40:17] <%itsjustdoogan> yay
[2:40:19] <%Eightesu> it's super worth it!
[2:40:23] <+Omegaanimus> that should be a raid mode itself
[2:40:23] <%Ion_Laser> @Solidus_113 that'll probably happen when RE3 Remake comes out
[2:40:23] <ToastyBroDude> @spinningchurro He asked chat for help before remembering something, so he isn't trying to look smart
[2:40:26] <JetpackMcQuack> That room is just red now
[2:40:27] <%DashXero> Did Woolie ever check out the parking lot again?
[2:40:28] <+legendfather_of_giants> @tank7013 almost guaranteed
[2:40:29] <Derkinstacker> It makes the room red, it's worth it.
[2:40:31] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> The waiting room is worth it.
[2:40:34] <spinningchurro> @solidus_113 Hey man thanks for all your work. Appreciate the compilations.
[2:40:36] <ManfredA> @timetraveller2000 he has one. Mr. X can taunt you in this game, for real
[2:40:36] <+Jaegen16> It's worth it with Woolie's aim.
[2:40:39] <%ShockzNDrawe> @Solidus_113 CoolX Man, filled to the brim with delicious delicious T Virus
[2:40:40] <ishotmattday> cool
[2:40:40] <The_Introspector> Mr.X doesn't enter dead end rooms.

[2:55:48] <Gruhunchously> Put the dongle in Claire, Leon!

[3:06:15] <CptBritches> It seems too dark to me
[3:06:15] <OwlLightningMage> What if Woolie never figures it out WutFace
[3:06:15] <Kghaleon> Does Woolie remember the original objects that we need these to open the prison cell?

[3:27:32] <+magusdraco> @WoolieVersus it does more damage with the stabilizer on
[3:27:32] <+TheHeroAppears> put the scope on it
[3:27:33] <Phob05> Carbine
[3:27:33] <+Reizie_Etherealm> A skorpion is smaller than that
[3:27:36] <+atwitchical> @BioStormX nah, you don't have to shoot all 3
[3:27:37] <+Hamblasto> I just realized Woolie doesn't have a shotgun for upcoming stuff
[3:27:38] <volraths_bane> Megatron got that
[3:27:38] <TungstenViper> Cause a rilfe is heavy LUL
[3:27:39] <Pappajimbo> forgotten weapons on youtube does a video that shows how the stock works
[3:27:39] <Corporate_Redeemer> BECAUSE WE CAN, PAT
[3:27:39] <+tigerfang86> SHUT UP THOUGH ITS MY GUN
[3:27:40] <%sukiyakiwestern> VP70 is a historically terrible and stupid gun
[3:27:41] <megaminimechamocha> But Pat then you can't fire it in that dumb way from Sicario
[3:27:42] <$TRILLTURBAN> bc it's cheap
[3:27:44] <%yeknomlive> imagine a tank with just a handgun sticking out of it
[3:27:45] <turbofolk> Revolver ocelot Line of thinking
[3:27:45] <The_Introspector> Watching Woolie play RE2 makes me wish for nuclear winter... jk.
[3:27:45] <+thebonebard> because rednecks
[3:27:45] <dukenux> aww i like stock
[3:27:47] <+PenmanLupine> I miss Ada FeelsBadMan
[3:27:51] <Pookiedaexzile> Because Thats less traceable and more compact you commie Canandians
[3:27:52] <orphancrippler_> get the speed cocker attachment
[3:27:52] <+Jukku> VP70 is cool but not that great
[3:27:53] <+Ninestempest> Will woolie ever stream faster than 720p30fps
[3:27:55] <+Svanyr> All hail Gun Jesus and his disciple karl
[3:27:59] <+CloniiCory> Pat are you really going to complain about a pistol stock when you worship the Red9 so much? For real real?
[3:28:01] <+freeizone> sunken cost fallacy
[3:28:01] <%Ion_Laser> @PenmanLupine We all miss Ada
[3:28:02] <+in_spaaace> Nothing wrong with a stock on a pistol
[3:28:03] <TafferAA> already killed the floor zombie LuL
[3:28:04] <eldrich_horror> yeah puzzle time
[3:28:04] <Corporate_Redeemer> DRUM MAG FOR A PISTOL
[3:28:04] <+Jaegen16> Can't wait to see how much ammo Woolie wastes here.

[3:35:34] <+Vivaciousx3> ada is the best
[3:35:34] <+itssunderland> Leon's face after she blows Mr X up lmao, he's so turned on
[3:35:35] <megaminimechamocha> Ada wait
[3:35:36] <Kghaleon> Mods turn on emotes when nothing is happening, take it off when actual story happens. Amaze.
[3:35:36] <Scorian> Claire is better DansGame
[3:35:38] <Sphincter_Spelunker> She's a cunt
[3:35:38] <+DeaconBluesClues> I now realize Ada makes hunk and his team look like idiots and chumps
[3:35:39] <+GunToad> no fuck ada
[3:35:40] <+freeizone> Ada don't need no man
[3:35:41] <+Maids4lyfe> there was a bomb not a spark
[3:35:42] <%ShockzNDrawe> I get the idea of setting chat to emote only is to prevent people from spoiling things like when X shows up, but if you only do it whenever He shows up it still becomes a signal that he's going to show up. It's ultimately pointless.
[3:35:42] <Dingo_Eejit> BURNING HOT!
[3:35:43] <mrjohncarlton> Stay away from her Leon! You have to fuck Claire!
[3:35:44] <sislord> ADA SAVE ME FROM CHRIS

[3:40:08] <captainthunderwolf> @Menitta Mothman's trolling you, you put the scope on the grenade so the shrapnel knows where to go. "Makes the grenade accurate", total nonsense.
[3:40:08] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> THE HERO HAS ARRIVED!

[3:43:31] <AncelDeLambert> we don't know, the DLC could be before or after this
[3:43:31] <scrubviewer> Oh Leon you naive little boy
[3:43:31] <Sloavon> sorry bout that babe
[3:43:32] <ToastyBroDude> WHY'D HE BITE ME?
[3:43:34] <OkamiDude15> he got that 2 for one shot
[3:43:35] <+Ellie_Eyegore> I'm not because it leaves in question whether he shot his daughter or himself
[3:43:35] <%QueequegTheater> @xbb1024 Nope. BibleThump
[3:43:36] <+freeizone> Kendo escapes alive
[3:43:37] <CareBear420> maybe He use knife?
[3:43:37] <TafferAA> kendo lives Kappa
[3:43:37] <sislord> WHY YOU LYING
[3:43:38] <gustavozxd> and when he talks to claire its the most hilarious shit
[3:43:40] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ohh
[3:43:40] <ManfredA> Ghost Survivors is explicitly noncanon
[3:43:42] <breakerdsx> He designed Barrys MUGNUM
[3:43:42] <TheAmazingClaytor> Gotta Secure Contain Protect the city
[3:43:43] <%CubicPhantom> best theme
[3:43:45] <+tigerfang86> WHAT IF
[3:43:46] <TungstenViper> @WoolieVersus Kendo is the creator of the Smurai Edge
[3:43:48] <%Eightesu> what if
[3:43:49] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> except Ghost still dies in his DLC LUL
[3:43:51] <timetraveller2000> It’s especially weird considering he’s canonically dead
[3:43:51] <Guardiansaiyan> @Shockmaster182 Wesker and villians, and heroes are all about vacinines...anti vax is not research
[3:43:53] <+wizkid50000> My theory is he couldn't kill his daughter so he just kills himself
[3:43:54] <PayneBlack> Don't forget his fucking AWESOME song Kreygasm
[3:43:58] <KeiPrime> it was kendo's brother, who made the samurai edge
[3:43:58] <%fatal_penguin_> Show us your Feet, guys
[3:43:59] <megaminimechamocha> Noooo Kendo is alive in my canon, Pat!
[3:43:59] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[3:44:02] <+LoganPayne> GREAT LINE READ
[3:44:03] <%Ion_Laser> the ULTIMATE BIOWEAPONS
[3:44:03] <Plague_bagel> that explains the horrible things ive seen :)
[3:44:04] <rytisone> I cant beat Kendo dlc. Took like 6 tries
[3:44:04] <lethallylactic> thatexplainsallthehorriblethingsi'veseen LUL
[3:44:04] <Pappajimbo> he customised jills and chris stars guns
[3:44:04] <+generalve> no fuckijng shit leon
[3:44:05] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[3:44:06] <The_Introspector> Woolie blind.
[3:44:06] <BelMadness> Stupid cutscene
[3:44:07] <BlkFlameKami> woolle getting left
[3:44:07] <+Vivaciousx3> that line read
[3:44:07] <Ultimatefool> :)
[3:44:07] <castcola> "Okay I believe you"
[3:44:08] <Tetsu_TIW> That explains the horrible things I've seen 4Head
[3:44:08] <%mzrx7> ...
[3:44:08] <+Konquerer> CHUNK gets fucked anyway
[3:44:08] <sislord> good job leon
[3:44:09] <Shwepie> Leon will save the city by leveling it with a nuke.
[3:44:09] <firmlygraspi1> that explains my burning flesh
[3:44:09] <captainthunderwolf> @wizkid50000 That would explain where the DLC begins.
[3:44:09] <Spagheddies> The best line in the whole game
[3:44:09] <tyrano_the_wise> where are you?
[3:44:09] <+TransporterX7> God Leon's VA is OOF
[3:44:10] <CurrySauseBandit> Naaaw Leon
[3:44:10] <OkamiDude15> the greatest line read
[3:44:11] <BionicPulga> Lol.
[3:44:11] <ahbhajit> map up dude, it's all blue
[3:44:12] <+CommanderSqueaks> Non union actors, yaaay
[3:44:12] <Gruhunchously> The horrible things I've seen
[3:44:12] <CptBritches> That is easily the worst line in the game
[3:44:13] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> leon is trying
[3:44:14] <AncelDeLambert> nah, this guy totally wouldn't be able to just leave his daughter alone
[3:44:14] <keyworthe> fucking lve that line
[3:44:14] <Sloavon> M RACCOON
[3:44:14] <DiegoLeaoBR> Kendo had one shotgun bullet and it missed
[3:44:16] <TheAmazingClaytor> "Horrible things! :D "
[3:44:17] <+freeizone> ludonarrative
[3:44:17] <ManfredA> Marvin deserves his own mini-campaign
[3:44:19] <Matufreak> I love that line
[3:44:19] <copyritetm> but its odd since kendo doesnt die at all in this game
[3:44:19] <peachy996> Sometimes this voicework is RE2 levels
[3:44:19] <Guardiansaiyan> The City can be SAVED
[3:44:20] <happyface699> And there stupid trial runs
[3:44:21] <+JackMillerTime> isnt gene editing becoming a real thing
[3:44:21] <+AFrostyCookie> @wizkid50000 Thats actually kinda cool and I didnt think of that
[3:44:24] <timetraveller2000> THOSE HORRIBLE THINGS BibleThump
[3:44:24] <RoboXGP> Da-ad??
[3:44:26] <%PoopyDickens> oh leon, what a jokester
[3:44:29] <Neo_Kaiser> Kendo is RIGHT NOW shooting poisonous zombies in the head.
[3:44:29] <%Eightesu> Why was the helicopter in his trial in the sewer
[3:44:29] <%Keyd00d> NEW CANON
[3:44:29] <GundamF91> Leon's gonna save this uninhabitable city full of dead people!
[3:44:31] <scrubviewer> good he sounds too boyscout as hell
[3:44:31] <+michingmallecho> Leon save the bloodline. Raccoon city had its chance apatSmug
[3:44:32] <+Dingus_Tickler> That explains the horrible things I’ve seen :)
[3:44:34] <%SailingSaturn> or he will cirTan
[3:44:34] <%Ion_Laser> Capcom better get union actors for the RE3 Remake
[3:44:35] <TafferAA> HOW DO YOU KNOW D:
[3:44:37] <%QueequegTheater> NO HARD CONFIRM
[3:44:38] <AncelDeLambert> he got NUKED, Woolie!
[3:44:40] <+RelaxedPizza> vineMortis vineMortis vineMortis
[3:44:41] <Corporate_Redeemer> He gets nuked
[3:44:42] <+SvenHolgersson> SPOILERZ
[3:44:42] <+BopBeep> If he didn't kill himself the nuke would get him
[3:44:44] <+ZalgoTheWickedGod> But this isn't the original?
[3:44:44] <+PunishedMimikyu> you simply dont know that, pat
[3:44:45] <ManfredA> he dies regardless
[3:44:45] <Guardiansaiyan> @sakuraa98 FEMA can help!
[3:44:45] <+Javaa01> And RE3 still happens
[3:44:46] <OkamiDude15> woopsADD that explains the horrible things ive seen
[3:44:46] <$cureneckbeard> He died somehow!
[3:44:48] <b1gboss007> No he Isn't :(
[3:44:49] <+Tyler_Ruins_Games> Kendo MUST DIE
[3:44:49] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Outbreak is Canon Kreygasm
[3:44:50] <captainthunderwolf> What about Mr X's HAT, Pat???
[3:44:50] <$ooblagis> And Jill
[3:44:51] <%IDTheftVictim> Just kinda rephrases it
[3:44:51] <+Grayhammatter> big nuked
[3:44:51] <CptBritches> It is a confirm. The DLC literally says "what if" they lived
[3:44:53] <AbnormallyLargeAnt> U DON KNOW NOTHIN D:
[3:44:54] <+generalve> outbreak is not canon
[3:44:54] <TheHamwall125> The "4th" survivor
[3:44:55] <SomeDwarf> @WoolieVersus Just for reference Woolie the other two Ghost Survivors are 100% dead confirmed and canon
[3:44:55] <sislord> except leon fucking claire. oh wait
[3:44:56] <%Eightesu> Hunk is good though
[3:44:56] <Kghaleon> He'll be in RE3, shows what you know Pat.
[3:44:57] <%xXichibanballer> those people didn't make it out
[3:44:58] <KeystoneA1> Outbreak is cool
[3:44:58] <Rellim80> But Emma COULD be a new Protag
[3:44:59] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @JackMillerTime Super frowned upon. Any mistakes made can affect future generations and the human race as a whole o.o
[3:44:59] <h0b0chil> Rita lived
[3:45:00] <%SailingSaturn> Except John the Scientist has no Girlfriend cirSlain
[3:45:01] <+tigerfang86> maybe LUL
[3:45:01] <@mothmandraws> hunk made it
[3:45:01] <%Th3SmartAlec> Even the online one had some contradictions
[3:45:01] <+Solideva> He shoots himself in the face with a shotgun
[3:45:02] <%ChoculaUltra> so the other tofu/desserts aren't canon?!
[3:45:03] <Graywolf_the_45th> Nah, Kendo is totally alive
[3:45:04] <+LoganPayne> Hunk is bae
[3:45:04] <+ShikiHisashi> Rita made it out
[3:45:05] <ManfredA> yes, everyone from Outbreak survived
[3:45:06] <PayneBlack> cHunk made it!
[3:45:06] <OwlLightningMage> He gets killed by the rose if not a zombie
[3:45:07] <gatorafan> Except Leon and Claire dating right? RIGHT!?
[3:45:07] <scrubviewer> hunk made it
[3:45:08] <+ChaosAethr> He SHOOTS Himself not the girl
[3:45:09] <HitchhikingThrough> Oh hey, time for the OTHER MEME
[3:45:09] <+linSP> tofu LIVES
[3:45:09] <zedravan> outbreak is still canon
[3:45:10] <ahbhajit> rita lived, there's a cutscene
[3:45:12] <TungstenViper> Outbreak canonicity is doubtful
[3:45:13] <+SpiceMustF1ow> Tofu made it out
[3:45:13] <Spagheddies> Inb4 Emote only chat
[3:45:13] <+Answer_Moose> Tofu makes it
[3:45:14] <natebud> The reporter made it out at least
[3:45:16] <CptBritches> Outbreak is canon
[3:45:16] <$LuisKingKing> Outbreak is indeed canon
[3:45:16] <tri3dgE027> Outbreak Guys kinda escaped also, since Alisa has a written article in RE7
[3:45:17] <WotanCR> Hunk made it
[3:45:18] <The_Introspector> Ghost Survivor are what-if scenarios and in the description says that ALL playable characters met a grim fate. He ate his gun.
[3:45:19] <Corporate_Redeemer> Rita escaped, that's how Marvin got bit.
[3:45:20] <%xenonecromera> Hunk is canon
[3:45:20] <GoldeNOVA> The four people, plus the ones from 3 and the 8 from Outbreak?
[3:45:21] <+generalve> Mod turn emote mode BACK ON
[3:45:21] <+tigerfang86> Hunk made it cause Hunk's an actual god soldier
[3:45:21] <timetraveller2000> Outbreak should be canon, for the elephant alone VoteYea VoteYea
[3:45:22] <19DarkKnight87> We didn't get a hard confirm that Kendo died. In THIS version.
[3:45:22] <KeiPrime> yeah doesnt the repotrter havea n article in re7?
[3:45:22] <definitelynotyakra> Tofu cannot be killed
[3:45:22] <+TheBimbollo> The reporter made it out
[3:45:24] <snootyhooty> The number is about less than 50 people escaped Raccoon City
[3:45:24] <+freeizone> 'Every Ada is a clone' Kappa
[3:45:25] <+ShikiHisashi> The whole tunnel under the statue is from Outbreak too
[3:45:25] <BurdRightsActivist> Ghost survivors is already out!
[3:45:26] <KeystoneA1> That one asian reporter lady from Outbreak lives since you read her account of Raccoon City in RE7
[3:45:26] <linkinbird> Pat, why do you assume there are no survivors and do assume Leon would know there isn't?
[3:45:29] <scrubviewer> Night Hawk this is hunk from alpha tram
[3:45:30] <%DashXero> "Haaay"da "Wait" Wong
[3:45:32] <+NobleJedi> City of zombies
[3:45:32] <peachy996> People didn't know if Rebecca and Barry survived for instance
[3:45:34] <%Th3SmartAlec> Time for emote chat to signal to Woolie something is about to happen
[3:45:34] <AbnormallyLargeAnt> PokDarkrai
[3:45:34] <+SkaNinja> leon is tired, OK
[3:45:35] <+AFrostyCookie> Yeah, Hunk, Tofu, and all the other foods
[3:45:36] <SomeDwarf> Yes, how did they d othat
[3:45:37] <+Omegaanimus> Outbreak survivors are how the gvt was able to actually prosecute Umbrella
[3:45:38] <deviljhojho_> social commentary PogChamp
[3:45:43] <Prevot> Leon Naive Kennedy
[3:45:43] <%QueequegTheater> Leon, cities are fucking corrupt as shit
[3:45:44] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Topical
[3:45:44] <19DarkKnight87> In the original, yes, Kendo became a buffet

[3:45:56] <Pappajimbo> goddammn BUISSSSNESS MEN
[3:45:56] <WotanCR> still more subtle than a david cage game LUL
[3:45:57] <%ChoculaUltra> does Hunk appear in Tofu's ending in the remake?
[3:45:57] <+Eclipse_knight_> leon is so naive it hurts
[3:45:57] <+CloniiCory> Leon is so adorably naive.
[3:45:58] <Dragonborn983> Calling Woolie dies to the gator at least once.
[3:45:59] <Spagheddies> enbHangry enbHangry enbHangry enbHangry enbHangry enbHangry
[3:46:01] <+king_of_beggars> In RE games assume everyone died until they show up in a helicopter in a later game.
[3:46:01] <Maharbear> tofu is canon!
[3:46:02] <%Eightesu> Hunk is #2 for Chris to want to have fuck Claire
[3:46:02] <PayneBlack> brief DmC moment there
[3:46:02] <ManfredA> @Omegaanimus I thought it was Wesker that testified, even though it was all his fault

[3:46:33] <%Ion_Laser> @Guardiansaiyan LUL
[3:46:34] <pipboy344> @keystonea1 No you didn’t. She had a report on missing people in Louisiana. Raccoon was only in a magazine on the boat with no stated author
[3:46:36] <tri3dgE027> Leon was extremely naive in the original. His snarky side still hasn't overrode his 90's naivity
[3:46:37] <Mr_Strut> But he could be a murderer!
[3:46:42] <rad_dude123465> Honestly pat that is a boy scout question that’s completely reasonable

[3:56:11] <+Tyler_Ruins_Games> There is a weird, high-pitched "ringing" tone whenever Woolie speaks; possibly when Pat speaks too. Seemed to happen around the time Pat returned.

[4:00:13] <+magusdraco> @WoolieVersus it was a temporary noise that stopped
[4:00:14] <+Jukku> pat walked past the mic and it fucked up
[4:00:15] <ElenaManetta> It sounds like when you turn a speaker on full blast and it has that warble effect as it lingers.
[4:00:15] <bit_guardian> There is a buzzing. Yes.
[4:00:15] <PinkSocks> It's very loud, still going
[4:00:15] <@mothmandraws> I only hear it wen I turn it up really loud
[4:00:15] <+GuttyGoop> there is absolutely a ringing
[4:00:16] <PayneBlack> @WoolieVersus happened when Pat walked in front of camera

[4:00:25] <+Vivaciousx3> @WoolieVersus when pat walked in front of the camera is caused a high pitched ringing sound, and apparently some people can still hear it faintly
[4:00:25] <mesamus> i hear it
[4:00:26] <%krispen_wa> Maybe the ringing was the friends we made along the way
[4:00:26] <The_Introspector> It's called tinnitus.

[4:10:49] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Are the people who can hear it potential Stand users?
[4:10:50] <DracaenaLeaf> Shut up Pat jeeze god
[4:10:50] <wirblewomble> pat's ass makes alien sounds
[4:10:51] <Polengoldur> @WoolieVersus its that high pticed noise only teenagers can hear
[4:10:51] <+Salvation122> @BayowolfTerra TINNITUS BROS
[4:10:52] <Emperor_Machinus> I been hearing it the whole time
[4:10:53] <cryptods137> it happens whenever they talk
[4:10:53] <+Tyler_Ruins_Games> It just happens whenever you talk. It's high-pitched, somewhat faint, but persistent.
[4:10:53] <%fatal_penguin_> Theres no Ring, Everyone Is Crazy
[4:10:54] <%mukbun> might be the ps4/elgato or whatever
[4:10:54] <bit_guardian> @woolieversus It resembles a distant helicopter.
[4:10:54] <Sloavon> 111111111
[4:10:55] <MayorRev> 1111111
[4:10:55] <+KaneNightshade> i heard it ever since Pat returned from getting a drink @WoolieVersus
[4:10:56] <+Ninestempest> There's a ring my dudes, just gotta turn the volume up really stupidly high
[4:10:56] <Leaquru> It's like faint but not enough to not be noticed
[4:10:57] <sileo_patronus> It sounds likr tinitus
[4:10:57] <@mothmandraws> is it kirbys mic?
[4:10:57] <$cureneckbeard> I get it
[4:10:59] <+Zayasu> I CANT HEAR SHIT WTF
[4:11:00] <+magusdraco> @WoolieVersus I can only hear it at maxed volume with headphones
[4:11:01] <+Eclipse_knight_> i have really bad headache now
[4:11:02] <%cervidaequus> Sounds like a weird glitchy fan or low flying plane in the distance
[4:11:06] <+thebonebard> @neverforget2018 there is definently a ring but its very faint but bad enough to be super bad
[4:11:06] <kalamixy> Yeah electrical humming seems a good description
[4:11:07] <+SenorCounter> probably more in the bottom beard
[4:11:07] <+Answer_Moose> Welcome to the club Pat!
[4:11:07] <%Scourgie_> NO DECEIT I SAY
[4:11:08] <SsHomes> i can hear it
[4:11:08] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @WoolieVersus When Pat crossed in front of the set up, beeping/feedback started
[4:11:08] <+Vivaciousx3> @WoolieVersus when pat walked in front of the camera is caused a high pitched ringing sound, and apparently some people can still hear it faintly
[4:11:08] <+badchoice5> The Fire is dying out
[4:11:10] <+Auritus> no weird sounds here on my high end sound system
[4:11:10] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Its a ghost
[4:11:11] <%SailingSaturn> sounds almost like a purr cirThink
[4:11:12] <%Keyd00d> FINALLY
[4:11:12] <bomi1995> it was after pat passed so its probably a loose wire?
[4:11:12] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @hntronium
[4:11:12] <DiegoLeaoBR> Only if I put my ear in the speaker
[4:11:12] <happyface699> It’s earwormy
[4:11:13] <Arweynn> One of the times pat passed the camera the stream went wierd, might have hit a cable?
[4:11:13] <DrkJP520> there seemed to be distortion when pat walked infront of the camera, almost like it triggered the npoise
[4:11:14] <+NWR_James> @WoolieVersus Mute the entire stream. Silence stream is best stream
[4:11:14] <+TransporterX7> Yeah I can't hear shitass
[4:11:15] <@Menitta> the helicopter

[4:15:28] <+supasonix> Does the camera send sound?
[4:15:31] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Pat's stomping in front of the camera caused it

[4:25:44] <megaminimechamocha> A D A W A I T
[4:25:45] <tri3dgE027> @Lieutenant_America It was retconned that this gator got mutated due to the Sewer System being connected to the Umbrella Lab. As for why there is an alligator in there sewer system of Racoon City, it might be an escape from the Zoo(?)
[4:25:46] <+WeepProphet> dogs are people
[4:25:47] <$LuisKingKing> I doubt every asset is scanned but a lot of the complex assets are definitely scanned

[4:26:39] <PayneBlack> Sounds like a strong weapon doodLewd
[4:26:41] <+Kwista_> i mean it would be effective at destroying your enemy and preventing them from ever reinhabiting that area if you don't care about going there yourself
[4:26:42] <%xXichibanballer> You know nukes are probably good enough
[4:26:43] <dabirSA> the point of the t-virus isn't to turn cities into zombies, it's to make tyrants
[4:26:43] <LiquidMathew> Doesn't that whole conversation wrong? Wesker wanted to make Tyrants, zombies were side effect
[4:26:45] <+TransporterX7> Yeah but you won tho

[4:26:46] <%alibaba1101> Craigslist T-virus fluid in a cup
[4:26:48] <arcaderabbit48> Guys like the Tyrants makes sense because they're designed to be super soldiers. I guess a zombie apocalypse is more like a Scorched Earth kinda thing?
[4:26:49] <Agami23> well pat, its not just that they dropped it. a dude infected a train with leaches that had the T-virus

[4:27:01] <%KineKithZen> I'd like it if Capcom reimagined Umbrella as more like Theranos

[4:27:01] <%yoshkosh20> I just think of it as "oof that virus backfired. LETS MAKE ANOTHER ONE!!!!"

[4:27:02] <@mothmandraws> its not as dumb as warhammer virus bombs

[4:47:13] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:47:14] <@mothmandraws> dont worry woolie was a smart choice
[4:47:15] <%yoshkosh20> would be funny if some of the ricochets could end up hitting you
[4:47:18] <%xXichibanballer> I thought it was a good try tho
[4:47:18] <SourceHorse> you stopped the power to the switch
[4:47:19] <+JenovasPuppet> apatWrong
[4:47:20] <%PoopyDickens> it made more sense than other shit you've done @WoolieVersus
[4:47:20] <ZephynM> Now that you mention it, it's odd the door doesn't have a switch to close the it on the other side.
[4:47:21] <Gruhunchously> Mr X is Paige now?
[4:47:22] <nobknee> #BigThink
[4:47:23] <+MajiOMNI> Redfield line will prosper
[4:47:25] <KeiPrime> oh he's on caution thats why,
[4:47:26] <GeneralHysterics> Donezo
[4:47:26] <Zombrocom> @WoolieVersus it was a good try
[4:47:26] <+MrAtheGreat> What is this, fnaf?
[4:47:26] <Ultimatefool> Woolie I thought the same thing, you're not alone
[4:47:27] <+JusTTheGuyYouNeed> is MR.X just paige in with a hat ?
[4:47:28] <%gunplagoat> apatBig
[4:47:32] <The_Swedish_X> His logic wasn't bad, it was just missing information
[4:47:35] <+CommanderSqueaks> @ZephynM Not if it's meant to keep things in.
[4:47:35] <+Vivaciousx3> to be honest this is the weakest part of the game for me
[4:47:36] <Gray_skies1993> that sound she makes I imagine is horrendously accurate for being hit by something like that
[4:47:36] <+mobius_won> No babies for ada
[4:47:39] <+TDS462> To be fair, props to Woolie for trying to think about strategy.
[4:47:42] <%Fattness132> sbfpSetIn sbfpSetIn
[4:47:42] <peachy996> How would Ada know that about Annete?
[4:47:42] <chroma3> Woolie doing a LOT better than Pat did on this part tho
[4:47:43] <Gruhunchously> She's so unfazed by the whole thing.
[4:47:44] <Djinnazz> :)
[4:47:45] <ZephynM> @CommanderSqueaks Good point
[4:47:49] <CptBritches> Mr. X was sent by Chris to keep Ada from Leon
[4:47:50] <+Irridium> I mean it's not an unreasonable assumption what with many games' doors just closing themselves when the power goes
[4:47:53] <keyworthe> no wait that IS CHRIS, HE'S WEARING A FUCKING MASK
[4:47:55] <%yoshkosh20> mr.X calls that punch the baby breaker
[4:47:56] <+Hamblasto> Man, Woolie needs to not trust his instincts
[4:47:57] <%PoopyDickens> OH LAWD HE COMIN
[4:47:59] <Sloavon> HE LOST HIM
[4:48:01] <linkinbird> Woolie is flustrated, do not provoke him.

[4:49:02] <playdohface> CANT WAIT TO WATCH THIS NEXT PART
[4:49:02] <The_Swedish_X> X can only jump when he knows he'll land that down air.
[4:49:05] <captainthunderwolf> Heights are very stressful for Mr. X, Pat.

[4:49:09] <@mothmandraws> why didnt mr x just walk thorugh all the walls in the RPD
[4:49:10] <nobknee> Mr X hates the Superhero Landin', so he avoids it at all cost.

[4:58:16] <+Gatzarlok> Depends if it's a blunt or sharp object you get impaled on. A blunt object will be more likely to move organs and what not out of the way instead of tearing into them.

[4:59:02] <JooseNeck> Herbs give Leon BIG healing... pain tolerance go UP
[4:59:05] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @WoolieVersus this is the same universe where a guy got his foot literally cut off then rubbed some herb juice on it and it was fine. You think a bullet wound is gonna stop leon?

[5:01:09] <$prince_ire> In regards to pulling things a character got impaled with out of their body, it depends on what they got impaled with. Its its a blade or something else that has sharp edges, it actually should be taken out as leaving it in can cause further damage. If it won't cut the character by leaving it in, yeah, just leave it in.

[5:27:57] <@Menitta> DMC4 is now after DMC2 so yeah
[5:27:57] <The_Swedish_X> "I have to know"
[5:27:57] <aimlesshealer> I enjoyed the anime for what it was
[5:27:58] <%xXichibanballer> Don't watch it for the action. It's a slice of life ft. Dante from Devil May Cry
[5:28:03] <bursky00> Is not that bad, just don't expect it to be an action anime.
[5:28:04] <rad_dude123465> It’s alright

[5:28:52] <+OdysseyKnight> and then Geralt shows up
[5:28:57] <$prince_ire> Infect the Statues with the G-Virus!
[5:28:59] <+Tokanova> well i mean the resident evil stuff could be an example of like... humans who don't have faith and magic trying to counter and create thigns that can stand up to the magic stuff
[5:29:02] <Them00n> You could nuke that statue
[5:29:04] <megaminimechamocha> Just imagining how trivial all of the events of RE2 would be if Dante was in Leon's shoes.

[5:31:25] <lloyddboy> @Halowood it's time travel to pre-transition, doesn't say she never transitions
[5:31:27] <%Twoiis> oof chat explosion
[5:31:29] <Nathius_Requiem> Naoto's gender issues come from how fucked up Japan is about gender roles
[5:31:29] <ShreddingPixels> Chat WutFace
[5:31:30] <$prince_ire> Kanji not gay, Naoto not Trans
[5:31:31] <+Afterman_> BIGOT CHAT BIGOT
[5:31:32] <Onyx_Parasaur> How about they're still kids and trying to figure out who they are, is that a hard concept to get
[5:31:33] <cameliopardolis> WORDS ARE HARD
[5:31:33] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> KANJI IS STRAIGHT
[5:31:36] <waifoong98> ALSO KANJI ISN'T FUCKING GAY
[5:31:39] <th3madness> that's the western release
[5:31:40] <%UrsulaCat> PERSONA CHARACTERS ARE ARE ALL GAY AND TRANS
[5:31:42] <+someguy1472> Kanji is totally straight
[5:31:43] <megaminimechamocha> Chat why are you being psychos right now?
[5:31:44] <HitchhikingThrough> HES NOT GAY THO
[5:31:44] <+thelastpaleemperor> PAT KANJI IS FUCKING BI
[5:31:46] <%bbHighvalor> Kanji and Naoto otp
[5:31:46] <The_Introspector> No, Troy Baker thought Kanji was gay. He wasn't told.
[5:31:46] <Sphincter_Spelunker> It's ambiguous on purpose
[5:31:46] <BlkFlameKami> "localization"
[5:31:47] <+cvp5127> kanji is bi
[5:31:48] <KeiPrime> dude, kanji wants to give it to naoto hard tho
[5:31:49] <majindusto> KANJI IS BI
[5:31:49] <+JenovasPuppet> The English localizer staff?
[5:31:49] <roboguy2k> nooto disu shitu again
[5:31:50] <Nathius_Requiem> Kanji is 15, he probably doesn't know if he's gay or straight and that's fine.
[5:31:50] <+Metballs> Shadows are not accurate
[5:31:51] <+phatmac16> By the us division
[5:31:51] <Dragonborn983> Confirmed CSB moved to weekends
[5:31:51] <ViolenceLikePoetry> Kanji is super gay.
[5:31:54] <Rhinoprotoss> THIS IS LIKE DUMBLEDORE IS GAY
[5:31:57] <+Dastardry> That staff also told them to pronounce all the Japanese words wrong in P5
[5:31:59] <Thirtine> @UrsulaCat ur fucking right PansexualPride
[5:31:59] <Corporate_Redeemer> PAT THAT'S WRONG
[5:31:59] <OwlLightningMage> This is fun LUL
[5:32:01] <fuji_92> HOW CAN KANJI BE GAY IF HE LIKES NAOTO? l
[5:32:02] <+Drogavon> eh i found out I was gay when I was 11
[5:32:02] <gunblazer42> Oh god this is going the same route as the podcast.
[5:32:03] <%Dr00_PhD> Kanji is Naotosexual
[5:32:03] <SighterAvery> chat really fucking toxic right now
[5:32:04] <Divryne> RIP chat.
[5:32:05] <+SPKTR34> the entire point of kanji's arc is that he is not gay but he is insecure about the things he likes
[5:32:06] <RoboXGP> kanji is not gay wtf
[5:32:07] <aimlesshealer> Everyone has to be gay and trans, get with the times you shitlords
[5:32:09] <23rald> yeah thats true
[5:32:13] <%Aussie_Manny> can't believe these scrublords are wrong about anything.
[5:32:14] <+Metballs> They're SUPER exxagertaed
[5:32:16] <JDebss> Stop projecting chat
[5:32:16] <%QueequegTheater> @Rhinoprotoss Nah, Dumby being gay is the one retcon Rowling did that actually makes sense
[5:32:16] <janitor_tulkas> Is Kanji's sexual orientation really that important?
[5:32:17] <+JenovasPuppet> Also Chie is a secret dominatrix and Yukiko is a princess.
[5:32:17] <faegbeard> The Shadow is not the true self. Yukiko is not a huge slut bird.
[5:32:19] <PinkSocks> It really doesn't fucking matter what Kanji is, that's the point. But he is bi at least, he likes Naoto.
[5:32:20] <HiddenPorpoise> The shadow is literally baiting him aimlessly
[5:32:22] <AlFredo_Taken> Guys, we gotta move on from this trash pile
[5:32:27] <b1gboss007> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[5:32:27] <+Malacious> All the insecure dudes in chat m6kwD3
[5:32:29] <Valdorick> Dejavu y'yall, its like its episode 2 of the pod cast all over again.
[5:32:30] <RoboXGP> it's about male insecurity, kanji is not gay lol
[5:32:30] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @konami2010 You'd know. It's more of his interests are considered feminine
[5:32:32] <+CommanderSqueaks> Never move on.
[5:32:32] <+cvp5127> true
[5:32:33] <+OdysseyKnight> Yu's sexual energy transcends reality
[5:32:34] <The_Swedish_X> I have a feeling a lot is getting lost between localization, and also backtracking
[5:32:35] <Revzero25> Yu is best protag
[5:32:36] <WaxWitch> dick magnet LUL
[5:32:36] <The_Introspector> Yu makes Yosuke gay in the anime.
[5:32:37] <+CloniiCory> You mean the same thing that happened to Yosuke in the anime?
[5:32:38] <nobknee> This is as important as the orientation of OverWatch characters. Kappa
[5:32:39] <majindusto> ITS FUCKING YU!!!
[5:32:41] <$cureneckbeard> nyannTsun
[5:32:41] <ECRead> EVERYONE DOES THAT TO YU THOUGH
[5:32:42] <+HostilePoundcakes> NotLikeThis
[5:32:43] <megaminimechamocha> LUL @ chat whenever an LGBTQ person dares to have an opinions
[5:32:44] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Fujiwara_92 Well, you could argue that he thought Naoto was a guy at first. Kanji's clearly confused to some extent about his sexuality.
[5:32:44] <hntronium> Woolie, you and Pat are the exact kind of people that Kanji would hate
[5:32:45] <+phatmac16> That's anime harem antics
[5:32:45] <Lazyallaround> dick magnet? Sure you dont mean Sex magnet?
[5:32:45] <NerdSquid> Anime!
[5:32:45] <absolute_cagemony> Oh hey guys, do I smell a dumpster fire?

[5:32:47] <%Dr00_PhD> that was yosuke tho
[5:32:49] <Dragon_Batman> They still are trying to figure out what their interests are
[5:32:49] <+dougrayman> yu is a everything magnet....
[5:32:49] <ChiefSombrero> Yosuke is that stupid, cause he is
[5:32:51] <bursky00> Broske have the same reaction so his game now?
[5:32:51] <+JenovasPuppet> Kanji isn't gay, but he'd fuck Yu in a heartbeat.
[5:32:52] <th3madness> I guess yosuke is a piece of shit judging by his shadow since that's his true self Kappa
[5:32:54] <b1gboss007> kanji also blushes at the girls in bikinis
[5:32:55] <JDebss> GAY AS THE DAY IS LONG
[5:32:56] <23rald> LUL
[5:32:57] <%Explodincatz> hi pat
[5:32:57] <Prevot> remember that Yosuke is the one that was supposed to be gay
[5:32:59] <cameliopardolis> hwat
[5:32:59] <%Pyretech> Kanji's not gay - his whole story is that he likes stereotypical "gay" things and is ashamed of this
[5:33:00] <SpaceGuntank> you're basically opening pandora's box
[5:33:00] <StarlitStunner> @faegbeard but Yousuke is a disco ninja frog
[5:33:04] <%Th3SmartAlec> Yes I do want to sit here for an hour.
