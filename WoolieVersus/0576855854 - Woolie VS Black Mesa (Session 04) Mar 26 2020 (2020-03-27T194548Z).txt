[0:13:28] <+Freeborg1997> How does Woolie decide which comments he reads?
[0:13:33] <%Haarute> spring man is an assist trophy right? so i don't think it'll be him.
[0:13:35] <MichaelDood> Reggie's gonna come for ya PogChamp
[0:13:38] <mr_gunn> Yo woolie when you played Arms did you summon a fighter into Smash with it?
[0:13:38] <jasonisgold79> Let's be honest, Thicc Queen from ARMS is gonna get in.
[0:13:42] <+Proxzo> Cant wait for the OST
[0:13:47] <valriot> Sakurai loves asses, she in Kreygasm
[0:13:49] <+prime_name> Springman/Springtron

[0:13:58] <jasonisgold79> @valriot Exactly.
[0:13:58] <+Proxzo> Do you think we gonna get aSmash mix?
[0:14:03] <PsychicKirby> @solidus_113 But do we care? Kappa
[0:14:17] <+prime_name> @WoolieVersus She's already a spirit/sticker
[0:14:19] <%The_Timo> But Springman is already a trophy, there isn't anyone who is a trophy AND a fighter right? So it probably won't be him
[0:14:22] <%GraceTBM> fuckin vinegar was out around here weirdly
[0:14:29] <valriot> I live in the UK, that is not the case ehre
[0:14:30] <derap41> Can't live of off tea

[0:14:49] <%Akizea> @the_timo this could be the character to break that
[0:14:50] <%DensityD> THE DEMAND
[0:14:55] <+cvp5127> @The_Timo chrom is in and hes still still a part of robins fs
[0:15:00] <%RioGascar> theres no meat around here
[0:15:06] <@Solidus_113> The peanut butter isle when I went was completely empty
[0:15:08] <%GraceTBM> @jasonisgold79 The edited LP will be releasing on the channel once space clears up
[0:15:16] <%RioGascar> so it was going to local farmers market for meat this time
[0:15:19] <jasonisgold79> @GraceTBM Cool.
[0:15:28] <%The_Timo> I don't think they'll break the trend
[0:15:40] <PsychicKirby> canned meat was going here like they were preparing for a Fallout game
[0:15:44] <%Akizea> I mean sakurai clearly doesnt give a single fuck so
[0:15:50] <+Slimshazbot> Nah play vanilla
[0:15:50] <@Solidus_113> you really don't need a mod for that
[0:15:52] <unit24> ehhh probably shouldn't mod HL2 on the first run

[0:17:14] <available_line> @WoolieVersus Woolie have you ever considered doing a play-through of the Mass Effect games? They're not that time-intensive, very narratively driven, and I know you only played the 1st one.
[0:17:19] <%RioGascar> I mean i played half life 2 my first time on the orange box for 360
[0:17:25] <%RioGascar> and it was amazing

[0:38:31] <+D4C_Trice> out of curiosity how are you able to join Woolie on streams considering the lockdown Reggie?
[0:38:33] <alephalpha> at the very least it's good that some people are asymptomatic

[0:39:51] <%Toxicjok3r1209> will woolie make it to questionable ethics today?
[0:39:52] <%Synthos3> Alyx isn't in HL

[0:41:04] <%DensityD> thanks for trying
[0:41:05] <xeros720> liam gloves? never too early
[0:41:05] <+Jayleedurr> I have many thought
[0:41:08] <%Synthos3> Track ball solves all
[0:41:08] <worldbrand> get a clipboard or a notebook and a cushion or something
[0:41:08] <%Toxicjok3r1209> if he does it'd be better on the orange box
[0:41:11] <slyarvicle08> Hello @WoolieVersus and reggie how are you? Good Morning from mexico

[0:41:40] <%DensityD> hello @slyarvicle08
[0:41:43] <unit24> thankfully this setup isn't necessary for the other games
[0:41:54] <unit24> I played orange box on 360 and it played decently
[0:41:56] <%DensityD> I almost thought that was a breakable wall
[0:42:09] <jasonisgold79> @unit24 Same
[0:42:11] <%GraceTBM> yeah hl2 with a controller is totally fine
[0:42:22] <+EdenOfLove> woolz you're not supposed to go down there, that's the ladder to get you back tto the belts
[0:42:26] <+chvmpchange> woolie needs a new pc that doesn't hitch while playing Black Mesa before he gets a gamer cube
[0:42:34] <Lancaster_H> if you're decent at controller aiming its fine
[0:42:39] <Lancaster_H> woolie, is not
[0:42:47] <licketysplit123> source engine loves to hitch no matter what nowadays
[0:42:52] <%Javaa01> Yeah this bottom area is just set dressing for if you fall down
[0:43:01] <+EdenOfLove> i mean @chvmpchange you dont buy a new pc you buy better parts
[0:43:05] <licketysplit123> i think that 2016 steampipe update fucked it
[0:43:05] <jasonisgold79> It's okay. But if you have to play with a Keyboard & Mouse. Then see what control scheme fits you best.
[0:43:22] <%Javaa01> Time to reload that save
[0:43:22] <+chvmpchange> just played this game and didn't hitch once🤷
[0:43:23] <+kewlmyc> MY LEG

[0:43:30] <KaliasTV> Morphine time PogChamp
[0:43:38] <%Toxicjok3r1209> aperture science was also always on the verge of bankrupt
[0:43:54] <derap41> @Toxicjok3r1209 verge?
[0:43:56] <+EdenOfLove> The hitching is real :(
[0:43:58] <licketysplit123> it might depend on settings, i've seen lots of different fixes
[0:44:15] <jorniev> FREEMAN with the broken legs sprinting up a ladder without using his hands what a baller!
[0:44:28] <mMayrro> saved
[0:44:31] <jasonisgold79> Plus Black Mesa wasn't founded by a guy who was a Shower Curtain Salsemen.
[0:44:40] <jasonisgold79> THAT'S CANON BTW!

[0:44:54] <Hegelundra> no it's not woolie
[0:45:00] <%Toxicjok3r1209> black mesa didn't burn $70 million on moon rocks

[0:45:32] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 57 minutes and 14 seconds
[0:45:32] <licketysplit123> i wonder how much money their crate smashing room was
[0:45:35] <derap41> @Toxicjok3r1209 Invested you mean
[0:45:35] <jorniev> black mesa caused an alien invasion though
[0:45:47] <%DensityD> but they were funded
[0:46:01] <Lancaster_H> technically aperture caused it
[0:46:01] <Mangahero18> And yet the Portal Gun is better than the Gravity Gun in every conceivable way.
[0:46:02] <%Synthos3> thought they went down in one
[0:46:06] <Lancaster_H> bc borealis
[0:46:07] <%Synthos3> with the mag
[0:46:11] <%Javaa01> Two shots to the body, one shot to the mouth
[0:46:30] <Mangahero18> Plus we all know GLADOS is best gurl.
[0:46:32] <%GraceTBM> the gravity gun is less antagonistic to reality and continuity
[0:46:45] <%Synthos3> did I miss the ninja ambush!?
[0:46:52] <%Synthos3> damn
[0:46:53] <jasonisgold79> So has Reggie told Woolie some of the interesting trivia with this series yet? Or even any of the lore?
[0:46:56] <%GraceTBM> don't worry, your ass will refill with guns
[0:47:02] <%Toxicjok3r1209> you can
[0:47:06] <%GeneralSCPatton> BIG BRAIN REGGIE
[0:47:09] <+EdenOfLove> you can totally shoot it
[0:47:10] <Hegelundra> shoot it
[0:47:16] <%Javaa01> You can shoot blue trip wires
[0:47:16] <Aydarkzero> monkaS
[0:47:18] <jorniev> i just remembered a line from freemans mind
[0:47:22] <jasonisgold79> Good Schuut!
[0:47:25] <derap41> Red ones aren't mines
[0:47:26] <%Toxicjok3r1209> the red are for turrets
[0:47:30] <Melchior_the_Wise> gotta jump
[0:47:32] <Melchior_the_Wise> you can do it
[0:47:34] <%Toxicjok3r1209> run
[0:47:36] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[0:47:37] <jasonisgold79> @jorniev Which one is it?
[0:47:48] <+chvmpchange> big hitches for big bitches
[0:48:00] <jorniev> "when the awnser seems elusive dont rule out ninjas"
[0:48:06] <unit24> the fuck was that conveyor belt
[0:48:11] <+EdenOfLove> woolzer can you lower the settings the hitching is pretty bad
[0:48:15] <jasonisgold79> @jorniev Advice for life. XD
[0:48:16] <ohmygodiamonfire> It's nice to know this part of the remake is just as bad as it was in the original game.
[0:48:18] <%DensityD> PRAISE GABEN
[0:48:26] <derap41> Alyx
[0:48:29] <Camail> they JUST released alyx
[0:48:33] <derap41> like they just realesesd somethign
[0:48:33] <Camail> worst timing
[0:48:34] <+Slimshazbot> @WoolieVersus Gabe is working on brain interface tech actually
[0:48:34] <Fenlig> Gaben is working on Brain interface ideas
[0:48:35] <Melchior_the_Wise> he literally just did an interview and looks like Santa-Jesus
[0:48:35] <%GeneralSCPatton> BUT ALYX THO
[0:48:36] <%Synthos3> They didn't make many changes to the main game, just Xen, right?
[0:48:36] <%Javaa01> Gaben's busy building the matrix
[0:48:43] <TigerClaws12> hitching is probably source, not settings
[0:48:43] <jasonisgold79> Releasing a new HL game for VR.
[0:48:43] <Lancaster_H> My absolute favourite is still "I would feel bad about this, but morality is for people who don't have other people trying to kill them every five minutes."
[0:48:43] <jorniev> "occam's shuriken"
[0:48:44] <licketysplit123> gotta love that 90s game design tropes
[0:48:46] <blue6sub6remnant6> Gaben is just plugged into the steam throne.
[0:48:55] <Melchior_the_Wise> and talking about Brain Machine Interfaces for Half-Life
[0:48:55] <Texascourier> Gamboling on CSGO skin websites
[0:48:57] <%GraceTBM> is Alyx first party developed?
[0:49:01] <%RioGascar> Yes
[0:49:06] <%Toxicjok3r1209> Gaben has been dead for the past 13 years
[0:49:06] <%RioGascar> valve made alyx
[0:49:10] <awalr> I don't think think graphics settings would help hitching, I think it's when it loads in new assets on the fly from the HDD
[0:49:12] <%Toxicjok3r1209> the one you are seeing isn't the real him
[0:49:29] <+Slimshazbot> Alyx is as first party as a VR game gets
[0:49:34] <+Slimshazbot> So polished
[0:49:47] <+chvmpchange> Yeah I was thinking it might just be an bed problem
[0:49:58] <unit24> I think this is the place where nobody will get shit for being lost
[0:49:59] <ScreamLord> "Yeah I don't think they're gonna buy 47 counts of armed self-defense against trained soldiers."
[0:50:21] <%GraceTBM> it was probably my cynicism making me think Alyx was contracted out
[0:50:23] <jorniev> fuck it lets just post freemans minds quotes
[0:50:23] <@Solidus_113> I think they get 30% of initial game sales?
[0:50:30] <Lancaster_H> "Radiation is the gift that keeps on giving."
[0:50:35] <jorniev> Ninjas understand quantum mechanics a lot more than people realize. That was a controversial part of my dissertation.
[0:51:01] <%GeneralSCPatton> @jorniev Sick quotes, bro
[0:51:04] <%Javaa01> Yeah if you fall down in this area, just reload a save
[0:51:09] <TigerClaws12> yahooo
[0:51:14] <@Solidus_113> And Steam at the start was hated just as much as Epic is now
[0:51:18] <@Solidus_113> it was garbage
[0:51:19] <TigerClaws12> Yahoo declined the offer
[0:51:23] <jasonisgold79> "At least this Shotgun won't betray me. It's filled with pellets not lies!"
[0:51:31] <%Haarute> "You can never prove the absence of ninjas, only their direct presence."
[0:51:33] <%RioGascar> valve has to be the one to take the bullet
[0:51:35] <%RioGascar> always
[0:51:41] <Lancaster_H> "See, this is why I'm such a good theoretical physicist. I solve problems that shouldn't even exist to begin with."

[0:51:50] <NevikGamina> BibleThump
[0:51:53] <%GeneralSCPatton> I didn't learn about Steam until I bought a physical copy of HL1 Anthology.
[0:51:56] <%Synthos3> Freeman's mind is an infinite font of quotes
[0:52:01] <+jiggy_snipe> drm amirite KappaHD
[0:52:02] <%RioGascar> no one was gonna take the bullet for VR so valve had to
[0:52:03] <%Javaa01> Steam in 2004 was garbage, but so was everything else at the time so eh
[0:52:03] <jasonisgold79> Indeed.
[0:52:09] <@Solidus_113> this is a bad puzzle room
[0:52:14] <nobknee> @WoolieVersus What's your favorite canned food, Woolz and Reggie?
[0:52:35] <+EdenOfLove> go through the vent with red lighting
[0:52:35] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:52:40] <%Javaa01> It's the way, just don't fall off the conveyors
[0:52:49] <+BlackSunEmperor> need to get back to the room where you fell in the water
[0:52:55] <derap41> Yeah Half Life kinda gets worse the longer you paly
[0:52:59] <jasonisgold79> "Which way? Red? or RED?"
[0:53:05] <$StaceMcGate> I just saw that Arms was announced for Smash
[0:53:07] <NevikGamina> bless reggie with these knowledge tidbits
[0:53:12] <%LordSDB> Os that a item hanging there?
[0:53:19] <oyyzzo> become the trash
[0:53:22] <%Javaa01> Nope
[0:53:34] <PsychicKirby> Valve unfortunately went through the effort of making all of their tools and great games at the times of their making. Then made the business decision to just rent it for distribution. I hope Alyx is the defib Valve needs to get creating again, but I don't know.
[0:53:34] <%Javaa01> The trash conveyor is not the way
[0:53:34] <+EdenOfLove> i think he wants to go through solid waste dispolsal. not sure
[0:53:39] <%LordSDB> Okay cause it looks like a item to get
[0:54:04] <%Synthos3> don't fall
[0:54:07] <%Synthos3> don't do it
[0:54:07] <licketysplit123> mah derap this is really the only bad part, even Xen wasn't terrible, despite it's bad rap
[0:54:09] <LokimenD> doors in HL1 LUL
[0:54:14] <Hegelundra> @WoolieVersus if it doesn't have a door handle then it's a fake door
[0:54:18] <licketysplit123> i will also defend the teleportation room with my life
[0:54:25] <%Javaa01> Solid Waste Disposal is the way to go here
[0:54:27] <@Solidus_113> Real Fake Doors
[0:54:34] <derap41> Real fake doors
[0:54:35] <$StaceMcGate> I hate the underwater reactor part more
[0:54:42] <%GraceTBM> it sure is consistent as fuck
[0:54:48] <%Javaa01> It is very much consistent
[0:54:52] <%GraceTBM> ouch those conveyors
[0:54:57] <LokimenD> Just don't trust the doors
[0:55:00] <NevikGamina> i love in the tube tube, we're refered to as the Universe LUL
[0:55:03] <+EdenOfLove> woolie go through the vent with the red light
[0:55:06] <Fenlig> Is woolie gonna play HL2 after this?
[0:55:12] <%RioGascar> It is very consistent
[0:55:17] <+crimsonharvest> i hope you watch the Freeman's Mind about this section later @WoolieVersus
[0:55:18] <%GraceTBM> just keep jumping on conveyors and following them and you'll find the exit eeventually
[0:55:19] <%Synthos3> real fake hatches?
[0:55:20] <%RioGascar> no door handle = no open
[0:55:20] <%GeneralSCPatton> Did we just become the god of Pantheism?
[0:55:20] <jasonisgold79> Alright, now let's quote Barney's Mind.
[0:55:30] <@Solidus_113> Sequel LPs rarely ever happen right when the original is finished
[0:55:31] <+BlackSunEmperor> the conveyors are the trick here
[0:55:34] <@Solidus_113> don't bet on it
[0:55:39] <%Javaa01> We went to a new area
[0:55:48] <%Javaa01> Woolie just fell off
[0:55:49] <+DreyfussFrost> I think most working doors in HL are red, the white ones are usually fake? It's been quite a while though so I'm not confident about that.
[0:55:51] <unit24> pretty damn certain one of the conveyors is the way
[0:55:56] <licketysplit123> i haven't watched barney's mind in years jeez, i miss all those series
[0:56:04] <%Synthos3> aaaaaye
[0:56:11] <jasonisgold79> I do hope Woolie plays DOOM Eternal. His LP of DOOM 2016 was soo fun.
[0:56:19] <unit24> shit
[0:56:20] <%Toxicjok3r1209> reggie has the right idea
[0:56:23] <%Javaa01> Reload last save
[0:56:24] <@Solidus_113> this is why you save often here
[0:56:26] <jorniev> bout black mesa There's probably gonna be a Congressional hearing about us later, asking "how did this happen?". And every single person is gonna say "Uhhhhh... uhhhhhh... uhhhh..."
[0:56:27] <NevikGamina> bless reggie
[0:56:31] <%GeneralSCPatton> THIS IS WHY YOU SAVE SCUM
[0:56:35] <Hegelundra> reggie bless
[0:56:44] <$StaceMcGate> Falling in the water is a failure of the game designer
[0:56:44] <%Toxicjok3r1209> galaxy brain reggie
[0:56:46] <LokimenD> Thank you Reggie
[0:56:47] <%Synthos3> That squirrel looks familiar
[0:56:53] <%Javaa01> Just reload the save, you'll save minutes
[0:56:54] <%GraceTBM> you're correcto woolz
[0:57:01] <Hegelundra> save scum example 1
[0:57:08] <NevikGamina> yeah just save scum this area
[0:57:08] <%GraceTBM> wrong one
[0:57:17] <jasonisgold79> @licketysplit123 Fun Fact: The creators of Barney's Mind & Chell's Mind actually ended up Marrying each other. <3
[0:57:20] <+chvmpchange> I mean if hes planning on playing Alyx soon hes probably gonna be playing HL2 relatively soon
[0:57:20] <+DreyfussFrost> Yeah all the open doors in here are red, the white ones are fakes. Pretty sure that holds up for most of the series.
[0:57:36] <derap41> We carry On!
[0:57:39] <%GeneralSCPatton> @jasonisgold79 Aww
[0:57:44] <%Javaa01> Save here

[0:58:53] <unit24> I like how they made the ladders red in this version so they're more visible
[0:58:54] <%GraceTBM> i think the final patch changing the ladders to red was a great idea

Trespasser or not, I have rights, and I'm entitled to a reasonable expectation of safety and comfort when I break into a place. This is America, after all."

[1:25:35] <dukenux> For god sakes OPEN THE SILO DOOR
[1:25:35] <Solid_Stro> I thought you thanked satan now?
[1:25:38] <+Superbro64> Is it intentional that the nerds just DIE spontaneously?
[1:25:38] <jasonisgold79> Ya know you joke, but after watching a video of someone explaining most of the canon Kirby Lore. I'm thoroughly convinced that some form of Eldritch Abominations DO exists in Kirby. And that Kirby may or may not have come from or be related to one.
[1:25:40] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> YOU'RE IN MY WAY SIR
[1:25:42] <PsychicKirby> But I'm fairly certain @WoolieVersus means the factory in Kirby 64. But hey, I cold be wrong.
[1:25:45] <+jiggy_snipe> wait did someone microwave a cat?
[1:25:51] <%Javaa01> Those doors are blocked

[1:26:47] <Fenlig> Barney doesn't have the same health insurance as Gordon and he knows it.
[1:26:47] <+TyeTheCzar> Just press use in front of him to make him stay
[1:26:48] <%LordSDB> Good shooting woolie
[1:26:48] <%FuqBoiSlim> man....
[1:26:49] <@Solidus_113> yo i'm adding this guy to friends
[1:26:52] <%Javaa01> That's a shortcut
[1:27:21] <Visorak6> Gordon has a PhD of course he can handle lasers
[1:27:36] <unit24> I wonder if woolie should turn up the difficulty at some point if he's aiming better with a mouse?
[1:27:46] <%RioGascar> what does the guy say in that video after the bomb is planted?
[1:27:47] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:27:52] <unit24> 1.0 defaults to easy difficulty I think
[1:28:03] <@Solidus_113> sasuga
[1:28:14] <AncelDeLambert> Dumbest line at the start of the game: "This is not how my PhD should have gone! Go here, push that button, push this button! I expected better!" Bitch, you wanna be stuck on a desk writing grant proposals? Shut up.
[1:28:21] <NevikGamina> i wonder if barney is alright LUL
[1:28:21] <%Javaa01> Now you gotta deal with the ayyliens instead
[1:28:28] <%GraceTBM> it doesn't seem like we need any particular increase in difficulty
[1:28:47] <NevikGamina> ez pz
[1:28:48] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Just a little bit Barney
[1:28:53] <venomfury86> Hurry, get the jetpack!
[1:29:12] <licketysplit123> @AncelDeLambert lol it's a joke about the gameplay, common meme that freeman is a Ph.D MIT graduate but he shoots the gun and pushes the button
[1:29:20] <AncelDeLambert> ixnay on the etpack-jay
[1:29:35] <licketysplit123> it's even lampshaded by valve themselves in HL2
[1:29:46] <dukenux> BASTURD
[1:29:50] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Secure this corner
[1:30:00] <+Superbro64> Is it possible to have a security guard with you through the entirety of this game?
[1:30:07] <licketysplit123> nope
[1:30:08] <Melchior_the_Wise> no
[1:30:10] <dukenux> nah
[1:30:10] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> "Reload Mr Darlington"
[1:30:13] <AncelDeLambert> @licketysplit123 it just falls flat if you know anything about research or academia. Literally half of research is "go here, press button"
[1:30:18] <licketysplit123> ladders thwart them
[1:30:20] <AncelDeLambert> the other half is grant proposals
[1:30:27] <licketysplit123> yeah but it's a game so y'know
[1:30:27] <dukenux> ladders and jumps
[1:30:41] <+Superbro64> I assume the final section is solo only, but also ladders and jumps
[1:30:43] <Sundaysmiles01> yay, murder machine physics
[1:30:46] <+Superbro64> well that sucks
[1:30:49] <dukenux> This reminds me of that scene from Spider-man 2
[1:30:50] <%Toxicjok3r1209> GET THE SNAKRS
[1:30:54] <licketysplit123> plus black mesa is doing alien crystal research and teleportation which is better than press button lol

[1:31:40] <+Rabbitmage> homing bugs
[1:31:43] <StarlitStunner> Best boys
[1:31:45] <+DreyfussFrost> SNARKS!
[1:31:47] <+Mkingston> Store them in your ass rachuBUTT
[1:31:48] <%Javaa01> They attack anything living
[1:31:48] <GrandBlitzAce> they totally ripped of Stranger Things Keepo Keepo Keepo
[1:31:50] <jasonisgold79> The most annoying enemy in the game. Yeah I said it.
[1:31:51] <licketysplit123> ah i love snarks
[1:31:52] <venomfury86> CUTE
[1:31:54] <resloxxx> hungry boi
[1:31:54] <AncelDeLambert> you also don't find enough of the bastards
[1:31:54] <GrandBlitzAce> off
[1:31:55] <unit24> you spam them to distract enemies
[1:31:59] <%kyh9> MROE
[1:32:02] <licketysplit123> so annoying and useful at the same time lol
[1:32:05] <%kyh9> unleash the horde
[1:32:07] <Zeemod155> Crowd Control Grenade
[1:32:12] <AncelDeLambert> ... I NEVER found this room
[1:32:17] <%RioGascar> A lot of half life 1’s weapons kinda...suck
[1:32:18] <@Solidus_113> Biodome
[1:32:22] <+agumon9000> @WoolieVersus Go outside the office and look at the nameplate for the room
[1:32:23] <+DreyfussFrost> Snarks are the BEST.
[1:32:29] <%RioGascar> snarks, trip mines, bee gun
[1:32:36] <Melchior_the_Wise> Woolie on a lot of enemies those things are are great to get agro
[1:32:42] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> FeelsBadMan
[1:32:42] <AncelDeLambert> Biodome is creepy as fuck nowadays
[1:32:44] <%RioGascar> half life 2 at least all the weapons are useful
[1:32:48] <+agumon9000> @WoolieVersus Go outside the office and look at the nameplate for the room.
[1:32:48] <+Superbro64> Woolie just spastically flailing the crowbar around, on top of its actual animation, slays me everytime LUL
[1:32:55] <dukenux> LUL
[1:33:08] <%FuqBoiSlim> that sounds pretty based tbh
[1:33:08] <%GeneralSCPatton> YIKES
[1:33:26] <jasonisgold79> Like in design & concept I don't mind them. But in-game they're small, fast, hard to hit, and as a weapon, once they're finished with an enemy, they come after you. They're one of the few HL1 things that I'm glad they left behind.
[1:33:38] <$Essixian> @RioGascar Are you suggesting that snarks, the best bois in the Half-life universe, are not useful?
[1:33:40] <AncelDeLambert> this game needs a map so badly
[1:33:46] <%Javaa01> Guns on the rack for ammo
[1:33:47] <%RioGascar> Yes
[1:33:57] <jasonisgold79> @Essixian They're just flawed imo
[1:33:57] <%GeneralSCPatton> Spam snarks into a group and run away
[1:34:16] <Hegelundra> @WoolieVersus are you thinking about streaming half life 2 at some point?
[1:34:17] <%GraceTBM> they also do low damage, you get a low stock of them, and their pathing isn't great
[1:34:22] <$Essixian> @jasonisgold79 That's why they're the best, they know they're not perfect but they're content with that
[1:34:30] <+einherjarvalk> Snarks are in Alyx, just not as a weapon
[1:34:42] <%RioGascar> the bug bait in half life 2 are much more satisfying
[1:34:47] <%Toxicjok3r1209> ususally signs on the walls will point out important places
[1:34:48] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:35:04] <+jiggy_snipe> lol Reggie
[1:35:06] <AncelDeLambert> Woolie is lost in a segment of the map I completely missed, this game, man
[1:35:20] <+Superbro64> The wooden eye of that one pirate in Pirates of the Caribbean was fun
[1:35:22] <%Javaa01> Nope, Barney will still be there when you come back
[1:35:23] <jasonisgold79> @Essixian They're not terrible. It's just if they were to implement them again they're gonna need an overhaul. At least with how they currently act in HL1/Black Mesa
[1:35:23] <AncelDeLambert> also, the loading screens are a bitch
[1:35:25] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[1:35:26] <derap41> Reggie think about what you say sometimes
[1:35:27] <+D4C_Trice> Best blind joke ever was in yakuza 0
[1:35:36] <+Superbro64> I remember that dude to this day sometimes
[1:35:37] <$Essixian> @jasonisgold79 Bro, I'm shitposting LUL
[1:35:53] <AncelDeLambert> hello fren
[1:35:54] <%RioGascar> Source actually keeps a lot of things in the same place with loading screens
[1:35:59] <AncelDeLambert> whack whack whack whack
[1:36:02] <jasonisgold79> @Essixian I know. And I'm just giving my opinions. Nothing wrong here.
[1:36:13] <%RioGascar> its why the gnome achievement cane about to showcaw source’s level loading stuff
[1:36:13] <Melchior_the_Wise> Black Mesa and Aperture were doing the Dark Science.
[1:36:15] <licketysplit123> yeah but the loading is longer
[1:36:22] <%Javaa01> You don't need to backtrack to him
[1:36:22] <jasonisgold79> @Essixian I do like their desing tho.
[1:36:30] <%Javaa01> Just go up the stairs into the loading
[1:36:37] <$Essixian> Turn on the incinerator crikCult
[1:36:40] <AncelDeLambert> Give Aperture its due: it didn't call the military in to mop up
[1:36:59] <%Toxicjok3r1209> Cause nobody was alive to call anyone
[1:37:00] <%RioGascar> It just went bankrupt
[1:37:02] <Sundaysmiles01> whatabout the laser area?
[1:37:04] <Melchior_the_Wise> No, but it's sentient AI did.
[1:37:08] <+Superbro64> I forget that aperture and black mesa are in the same universe
[1:37:12] <AncelDeLambert> I mean, they had deadly neurotoxin, sure, but they didn't call the military
[1:37:18] <@Solidus_113> gotta find a way to turn off the big dumb Dead Space machine
[1:37:24] <%RioGascar> and also installed a homicidal ai
[1:37:28] <licketysplit123> i wonder what Blapperture Mesa is like
[1:37:48] <%RioGascar> no resonance cascade
[1:37:51] <Melchior_the_Wise> Is black mesa Microsoft and Aperture Apple?
[1:37:53] <%RioGascar> so earth doesnt get fucked
[1:37:57] <+Superbro64> if half life 3 happened back in the day, I wonder if you would of seen chel. That would be neat.
[1:38:01] <AncelDeLambert> ...basically?
[1:38:06] <AncelDeLambert> Yes. Yes they are
[1:38:15] <DaCheekyOne> Remember to wash your hands
[1:38:16] <+Superbro64> but that aint happening now, we half life alyx at this juncture
[1:38:30] <AncelDeLambert> Fuck, Aperture even has shiny white curved shells for all its tech, it's totally Apple
[1:38:43] <Melchior_the_Wise> Maybe Black Mesa is Google?
[1:38:51] <%Toxicjok3r1209> it's founder is way cooler though
[1:38:54] <venomfury86> HAVE YOU SEEN LOOPER?
[1:39:00] <AncelDeLambert> Meanwhile Black Mesa is blocky, exposed wires, and plug-n-play
[1:39:07] <Lancaster_H> Black Mesa is EVERYTHING
[1:39:08] <PsychicKirby> Black Mesa is running Windows 98, it's Microsoft.
[1:39:08] <+Superbro64> Google has alien testing up in silicon valley? LUL
[1:39:11] <Dave_VD> oh my god looper is so good
[1:39:12] <DaCheekyOne> Black Mesa is IBM
[1:39:15] <%Javaa01> Okay now you're just over complicating things for yourself
[1:39:15] <licketysplit123> remember when they announced TF2 for mac? RED and BLU is very fitting for mac and pc. good choice
[1:39:23] <AncelDeLambert> I mean, have you not HEARD of Steve Wozniak?
[1:39:23] <Lancaster_H> theyre a govt. funded shadow company
[1:39:27] <Melchior_the_Wise> I think IBM makes sense
[1:39:30] <licketysplit123> so whose facebook?
[1:39:41] <%RioGascar> The combine
[1:39:43] <Melchior_the_Wise> The combine
[1:39:46] <licketysplit123> makes sense
[1:39:52] <%DensityD> must perform surgery
[1:39:57] <%DensityD> with crowbar
[1:40:00] <PsychicKirby> @Melchior_the_Wise Well IBM did cut a deal with Microsoft back in the day
[1:40:11] <%RioGascar> Also gabe came from Microsoft
[1:40:11] <%Javaa01> Follow the dead scientists
[1:40:16] <+Superbro64> Question, has the entirety of the HL games only taken place in US? Do we know what the rest of the world is up to at all?
[1:40:17] <%RioGascar> He quit to make valve
[1:40:19] <%Toxicjok3r1209> what does nihilanth represent?
[1:40:19] <Lancaster_H> No Combine is Google, buying and assimilating everything
[1:40:34] <AncelDeLambert> please god update this game with a map, I beg you
[1:40:34] <Torgue_1> @Superbro64 HL2 is set in Easter Europe
[1:40:37] <%GraceTBM> superbro hl2 is super eastern european in tone and writing
[1:40:40] <Lancaster_H> @Superbro64 HL2, tldr shits fucked bro
[1:40:49] <licketysplit123> Combine is disney too
[1:40:49] <AncelDeLambert> they're MILITARY
[1:40:51] <%RioGascar> half life is new mexico while half life 2 is somewhere in Eastern Europe
[1:41:02] <%GraceTBM> doggers i like it
[1:41:04] <+Rabbitmage> man vs nature
[1:41:05] <%RioGascar> Alyx is also Eastern Europe
[1:41:09] <PsychicKirby> Nice shot
[1:41:13] <%GraceTBM> the shotgun sounds bizarre from this distance
[1:41:20] <+Superbro64> Huh, I'm dumb. Thought the main city in HL2 was American. My bad guys
[1:41:23] <licketysplit123> it looks like america is completely fucked in HL Alyx
[1:41:24] <%FuqBoiSlim> ah gottem ggs
[1:41:27] <jasonisgold79> The crossbow is REALLY strong in HL1.

[1:42:10] <%Javaa01> The legs and arms on enemies have a negative damage multiplier
[1:42:11] <+D4C_Trice> the other one was fighting the soldiers
[1:42:15] <Lancaster_H> geographical locations dont even really matter anymore by HL2 considering the 7 hour war
[1:42:18] <AncelDeLambert> ... hey, Black Mesa, fiber optics are a thing

[1:44:43] <Sundaysmiles01> Its the Gauss gun
[1:44:47] <venomfury86> RIP & TEAR
[1:44:51] <AncelDeLambert> it's just a big laser
[1:44:54] <Fenlig> I remember it as the Gauss gun
[1:44:58] <Lancaster_H> anyone here remember the TAU jumps in multiplayer Crossfire
[1:45:09] <%GeneralSCPatton> TAU CANNON
[1:45:10] <%Javaa01> You gotta go turn on more lasers
[1:45:13] <+DreyfussFrost> It's the Tau Cannon.
[1:45:18] <%Toxicjok3r1209> In hl2 alxy calls it the tau cannon but its also called the gauss gun
[1:45:19] <AncelDeLambert> Ensure shield is powered before firing test laser
[1:45:19] <jasonisgold79> The HL OSTS are generally really good.
[1:45:21] <%RioGascar> half life music is used sparingly
[1:45:21] <PsychicKirby> Rip and tear Gordon Freeman. Rip and tear until it is done.
[1:45:23] <@Solidus_113> one more laser
[1:45:35] <Dave_VD> tau cannon is a rad name
[1:45:40] <%RioGascar> but i find black mesa’s implementation kinda...bad at times
[1:45:43] <%RioGascar> the music is good
[1:45:47] <@Solidus_113> you want the charged shot for that
[1:45:51] <Zebroneath> You can charge the gun
[1:45:51] <%RioGascar> but just used poorly sometimes
[1:45:52] <cache_22> Alt-fire (Mouse2) is a charge.
[1:45:57] <AncelDeLambert> ... Woolie. This isn't Karate Kid, no sweeping the leg
[1:46:06] <+Mkingston> charge it
[1:46:11] <jasonisgold79> @WoolieVersus You can also Charge the Tau Canon by holding Mouse 2 I think.
[1:46:15] <Fenlig> Theres ammo for it there
[1:46:16] <PsychicKirby> LUL some wd40 on the lab machine
[1:46:17] <%Javaa01> There's ammo for the gun on the desk behind you
[1:46:18] <Fenlig> on the table
[1:46:19] <%GeneralSCPatton> CHARGE SHOT IS THE TRUTH AND THE WAY
[1:46:23] <@Solidus_113> the ammo for that is the yellow/black lunchboxes
[1:46:30] <dechakirk> Go grab the ammo from that desk
[1:46:31] <@Solidus_113> on your right
[1:46:35] <%GeneralSCPatton> AMMO ON DESK
[1:46:42] <+caramelatte1> DESK AMMO
[1:46:44] <%RioGascar> the ammo is plutonium
[1:46:45] <%GeneralSCPatton> RADIOACTIVE BOX
[1:46:51] <%GraceTBM> it's kinda rare
[1:46:59] <%GeneralSCPatton> AMMO IN THE ROOM
[1:47:04] <%RioGascar> tbf would YOU guys pick up a RADIOACTIVE BOX FOR AMMO?
[1:47:06] <%GraceTBM> eye for chat LUL
[1:47:09] <%Javaa01> It's a yellow lunchbox
[1:47:10] <dukenux> cool
[1:47:18] <Torgue_1> Grab that can of WD40; you're gonna need it later
[1:47:19] <%Haarute> it's the rarest ammo, but it's not RARE rare.
[1:47:21] <+Superbro64> someone had guass canon ammo on their desk?
[1:47:23] <jasonisgold79> The boxes are filled with Iridium I think.
[1:47:28] <@Solidus_113> it's a sniper
[1:47:30] <%GeneralSCPatton> Lunchbox of PLUTONIUM
[1:47:34] <derap41> That aim
[1:47:35] <mMayrro> god tier aim
[1:47:39] <AncelDeLambert> shotty is your friend
[1:47:40] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> And all the misses
[1:47:41] <%GraceTBM> doesn't hurt, just moves you
[1:47:41] <dukenux> wss afraid gonna miss on on tau canon while in a shower
[1:47:46] <%FuqBoiSlim> man...
[1:47:47] <AncelDeLambert> shotty is your BEST friend, frankly
[1:47:49] <%Javaa01> Also, it is a railgun, so don't miss the shot like you just did
[1:47:53] <Fenlig> poor hound eyes
[1:47:56] <dechakirk> And a real overcharge takes time
[1:47:59] <%DensityD> keep having fun, but kill better
[1:48:01] <AncelDeLambert> man FUCK hound eyes!
[1:48:02] <@Solidus_113> it won't explode on you
[1:48:05] <Giothegame> Peeper puppies
[1:48:19] <Ricobana> coomer what are you doing here
[1:48:19] <Daxalog> Do they still share the property of their shock wave being stronger if performed in groups?
[1:48:39] <AncelDeLambert> also: you can't carry enough rifle grenades at once to make them worthwhile
[1:48:44] <Sundaysmiles01> woolie...
[1:48:46] <%GraceTBM> this is a good mixup
[1:48:48] <AncelDeLambert> also, they don't fire far enough, gawdamn
[1:48:52] <rokxx> why does he aim so low NotLiketThis
[1:48:53] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:48:54] <jasonisgold79> Tau Cannon is similar to Black Iron Tarkus in DOOM 2016. Strong, but requires precision.
[1:49:16] <%RioGascar> when was tarkus in doom
[1:49:20] <AncelDeLambert> Woolie is having his arm restrained by Foot Fetish Reggie to only focus on feet
[1:49:28] <AncelDeLambert> you're a sick man, Reggie
[1:49:29] <%GraceTBM> gauss cannon was called tarkus
[1:49:30] <Melchior_the_Wise> its friendsly
[1:49:36] <%Toxicjok3r1209> he just called it that becuase guass rifle was mvp
[1:49:41] <jasonisgold79> @RioGascar It's what they nicknamed the Gauss Cannon in the DOOM LP.
[1:49:49] <%RioGascar> Ah
[1:50:01] <%GeneralSCPatton> NO ONE SPOIL ANYTHING OR I WILL KILL YOU
[1:50:07] <jasonisgold79> @RioGascar I mean, are they wrong?

[1:52:55] <AncelDeLambert> I had to cheat with no-clip at the end of the game, because a loading screen quicksaved me falling to my doom after a bad jump
[1:53:03] <+RealThiele> uh oh, hot dog
[1:53:05] <+linSP> Play roundabout every time a loading screen happens
[1:53:20] <Fenlig> Release the bugs!!!

[1:54:54] <Lancaster_H> yeah
[1:54:55] <%GraceTBM> no there was something similar in the original
[1:55:00] <AncelDeLambert> Woolie has Zen, he knows that to be centered is to be safe
[1:55:01] <Lancaster_H> before it was just a spinning blade
[1:55:03] <bleugh> ow ow ow
[1:55:06] <+caramelatte1> Woolie should have died

[2:00:09] <%RioGascar> How nice
[2:00:14] <XeroSigmaPrime> The game is CONSISTENTLY AMAZING from here on out, no down time
[2:00:16] <+RealThiele> military full of HEV bros would be handy
[2:00:19] <Melchior_the_Wise> YOu go with them
[2:00:20] <XeroSigmaPrime> Except Xen...
[2:00:30] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Xen is great in Black Mesa though
[2:00:39] <%RioGascar> this is not half life tho
[2:00:42] <%RioGascar> This is black mesa
[2:00:46] <XeroSigmaPrime> Ehhh it looks good, they didnt really fix the Xen issues tho
[2:00:54] <BurdRightsActivist> Who would win? The United States Military or One HEV Boi.
[2:00:58] <AncelDeLambert> @XeroSigmaPrime I dunno, man, there's a lot of swimming and silos and other dull shit
[2:01:05] <@Solidus_113> The only problem BM Xen has is that it's difficult
[2:01:05] <Melchior_the_Wise> HEVy Boi?

[2:01:46] <resloxxx> Shoot the padawan first
[2:01:46] <%GraceTBM> turret is plus on block
[2:01:48] <Solid_Stro> Shoot the nerds first, then the threat.

[2:02:13] <Sundaysmiles01> geek the geek first
[2:02:14] <jasonisgold79> RIP in Rest poor Nerd.
[2:02:19] <%Haarute> this chapter might get difficult for woolz
[2:02:20] <KillMyPast> Aiming hard
[2:02:22] <derap41> Listen these army jocks can't help themselves they see a nerd they need to shoot
[2:02:24] <lotharrio> Well gotta take out the target you can. Like any boss fight.
[2:02:24] <BurdRightsActivist> Back before I knew what a flatline was, I used to think the death sound was gordon swearing his ass off as he dies.
[2:02:27] <%Javaa01> Woolie vs Aiming
[2:02:29] <Vashido22> The nerd is gonna die again isn't he
[2:02:31] <+Nogopharo> Is he using controller?
[2:02:31] <XeroSigmaPrime> Xen looks AMAZING tho now, so it makes up for thw meh quality
[2:02:32] <%RioGascar> He gets gut shot and then headshot
[2:02:33] <%GraceTBM> this chapter is a bit of a difficulty spike
[2:02:36] <%Toxicjok3r1209> use youir snarks
[2:02:42] <jasonisgold79> Yeah from what I've heard the 1.0 update made the Soldiers a lot smarter.
[2:02:47] <Solid_Stro> Cover
[2:02:48] <Sundaysmiles01> tonight: on 'can woolie aim?'
[2:02:56] <+Superbro64> Is woolie usually this bad of a shot? Doesnt he play overwatch or apex or something?
[2:02:57] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1242929035937820672?s=20
[2:02:58] <unit24> woolie you should probably use the shotgun primary fire more often
[2:03:05] <unit24> it kills more often than you think
[2:03:13] <unit24> and leaves you less vulnerable
[2:03:14] <rokxx> we don't deserve reggie
[2:03:17] <BurdRightsActivist> @unit24 BIG NUMBER THOUGH
[2:03:18] <jasonisgold79> I think the Turret is on the roof.
[2:03:20] <AncelDeLambert> the recoil is so massive on the alt fire, it can really fuck you if it doesn't one-shot the enemy
[2:03:31] <+DreyfussFrost> He needs to actually shoot the chest or head though, and not the knees.
[2:03:32] <%RioGascar> Hey hes using lots of gun typs now so that satisfies me
[2:03:35] <jasonisgold79> There ya go
[2:03:35] <Vashido22> chat, if I've never played the original black life, will this be a better experience?
[2:03:37] <XeroSigmaPrime> Nah man, the secondary fire on the Shot does like 4 times the amonut of dmg for only twice the ammo
[2:03:44] <Mangahero18> As everyone knows crossbows are more powerful than rocket launchers. Tiny stick=win.
[2:03:47] <Vashido22> why did I say black life
[2:03:49] <Vashido22> dumb brain
[2:03:50] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> LUL
[2:03:55] <Lancaster_H> IF you can aim @XeroSigmaPrime
[2:03:55] <%GraceTBM> you can play black mesa and not bother with hl1
[2:03:57] <+RealThiele> this is much less violent that the original black life
[2:03:59] <%GeneralSCPatton> Crissbow > sniper rifle
[2:04:01] <%Haarute> you might want to save often from now on
[2:04:01] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Black-Life 2: Episode 2
[2:04:03] <jasonisgold79> @Vashido22 You could go with either this or the original. Up to you.
[2:04:03] <Melchior_the_Wise> It's BLACK LIFE NOW
[2:04:16] <AncelDeLambert> just throw a grenade up there
[2:04:17] <Vashido22> @jasonisgold79 I've heard as much
[2:04:18] <%RioGascar> I’d argue play half life 1 for the better soundtrack
[2:04:26] <AncelDeLambert> grenades are the turret-fucker-uppers
[2:04:41] <%RioGascar> but if you can replace black mesas’s ost with some old half life 1’s ost
[2:04:43] <%Javaa01> Or just save so you don't have to do this fight again
[2:04:51] <%Synthos3> wait, does the crossbow no longer shoot hot rebar?
[2:04:53] <+linSP> I agree hl1 is so worth playing for the soundtrack
[2:04:58] <%emeraldskrull> woolieTRASH woolieDATTEBAYO
[2:05:01] <%RioGascar> that was in half life 2
[2:05:05] <jasonisgold79> @RioGascar Awww. Oh well, to each their own.
[2:05:06] <%Javaa01> @Synthos3 That's a Half Life 2 only thing
[2:05:06] <XeroSigmaPrime> Theres caveats for both versions, honestly would recommend playing BOTH
[2:05:06] <lotharrio> Oh wow. How many of them just barely got out?
[2:05:08] <Melchior_the_Wise> That's only half-life 2
[2:05:09] <%Synthos3> oh shit, thats right
[2:05:10] <%RioGascar> half life 1 its a tranq dart
[2:05:11] <%Toxicjok3r1209> that's a cow skull woolie
[2:05:22] <+RealThiele> steal that mrap
[2:05:29] <%GraceTBM> black Mesa is also tranq dart
[2:05:31] <Mangahero18> I forget. Why are the military gunning down civilian contractors again? This part of the game is blurry.
[2:05:39] <%RioGascar> cover up
[2:05:40] <Psyramics> silencing op
[2:05:42] <%Synthos3> to hush everything up
[2:05:42] <XeroSigmaPrime> Cover shit up
[2:05:46] <%GeneralSCPatton> Save frequently from now on
[2:05:47] <+RealThiele> i believe this isnt military but a merc group
[2:05:54] <+linSP> Because nerds suck
[2:05:54] <SixthSun2> Y'know, it's nice that these military vehices are properly parked
[2:06:01] <XeroSigmaPrime> Nahh its the military
[2:06:06] <lotharrio> Oh no, he left his keys in there!
[2:06:06] <%RioGascar> however as the game progresses GOOD LUCK COVERING THSI UO
[2:06:11] <AncelDeLambert> yeah, I gave up on manually saving, and boy it FUCKED me
[2:06:16] <BurdRightsActivist> @Mangahero18 STOP RESISITING
[2:06:19] <Solid_Stro> Tacticool
[2:06:22] <@Solidus_113> "the black mesa incident"
[2:06:23] <jasonisgold79> @WoolieVersus Now that you're on keyboard, I think you can bind one of the buttons to be the Quicksave button. That way you don't have to pause every time.
[2:06:32] <+RealThiele> black and white camo for the desert
[2:06:35] <XeroSigmaPrime> Yea eventually they literally say "FUCK THIS SHIT" and bail
[2:06:35] <unit24> he's not on keyboard
[2:06:38] <AncelDeLambert> it's probably f5, it's always f5
[2:06:42] <%GeneralSCPatton> @jasonisgold79 Hybrid setup
[2:06:46] <+DreyfussFrost> @jasonisgold79 He's not on keyboard, just mouse.
[2:06:49] <lotharrio> The earth, the sun and the moon?
[2:06:56] <jasonisgold79> Oh, nevermind
[2:06:57] <@chesterr01> controller + mouse
[2:07:00] <Melchior_the_Wise> That actually makes sense, Zebras are that way because it blends into the heat distortion
[2:07:01] <AncelDeLambert> well tell Reggie to be on autosave duty, then
[2:07:06] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Woolie's abomination control scheme WutFace
[2:07:19] <jasonisgold79> Wait, then how does he jump tho?
[2:07:21] <%RioGascar> Yeah reggie coop the lp you coward
[2:07:29] <AncelDeLambert> Woolie just needs to go into business himself and sell a hybrid peripheral
[2:07:29] <Vashido22> LUL
[2:07:29] <Tuna_Can_0> LUL
[2:07:34] <@Solidus_113> you got 14
[2:07:36] <XeroSigmaPrime> Black and White camo works amazing in desert enviorments
[2:07:37] <Lancaster_H> @RealThiele nah HECU are marines
[2:07:44] <AncelDeLambert> just get an engineer, start putting together some designs, and SELL THAT SHIT
[2:07:47] <VJdarkworld> i found a japanese streamer who was doing the gamepad + mouse setup and she dubbed it the "Mongolian Method"
[2:07:50] <+DreyfussFrost> @jasonisgold79 It's still a PC game, you can still rebind.
[2:08:03] <jasonisgold79> @DreyfussFrost True
[2:08:04] <%Javaa01> They're trying
[2:08:08] <Sundaysmiles01> oh they're doing it
[2:08:12] <Vashido22> they're doing their best
[2:08:20] <Melchior_the_Wise> They did it
[2:08:23] <Melchior_the_Wise> he's dead
[2:08:24] <%Synthos3> Oll Klear
[2:08:34] <Tuna_Can_0> imagine dying to bugs
[2:08:38] <lotharrio> Did a lot of damage considering how safe it was.
[2:08:50] <Mangahero18> Kinda weird how rapidly things escalate in this series. It starts as a small malfunction leading to alien invasion, government coverup and eventually fullscale occupation by an extra-terrestrial government.
[2:08:52] <%Synthos3> read the signage
[2:08:54] <Melchior_the_Wise> You can use the turret
[2:09:05] <AncelDeLambert> do you see a turret? Get on it, 4 times out of 5 enemies will spawn in waves in front of it
[2:09:07] <%RioGascar> not really that weird
[2:09:08] <jasonisgold79> Ya gotta throw a TON for them to be effective. But then once they're done you gotta deal with a ton of Snarks if you get too close. That's my problem with them. They're too risk/reward for me.
[2:09:17] <%RioGascar> these things can TELEPORT IN
[2:09:20] <%RioGascar> you cant fight that
[2:09:29] <%RioGascar> not conventionally at least
[2:09:30] <%DensityD> "gruntmale_say My Ass Is Heavy"
[2:09:43] <Lancaster_H> @Mangahero18 gordon directly causes that last part
[2:09:43] <AncelDeLambert> Woolie wants a Monster Hunter bowgun reload. Frankly, I agree
[2:09:45] <Sundaysmiles01> the snarks are good against the Gargantuan tho
[2:09:50] <@Solidus_113> Mortar IIRC
[2:09:51] <%Javaa01> It's an undeployed turret
[2:09:59] <%Javaa01> So it's not functional
[2:10:00] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:10:05] <jasonisgold79> Are they?

[2:10:29] <%RioGascar> This should be the next chapter

[2:10:52] <@Solidus_113> shit's popping off
[2:10:53] <jasonisgold79> @VJdarkworld That sounds like it could be mod
[2:10:56] <%RioGascar> Oh huh the crossbow blows up barrels
[2:10:58] <Tuna_Can_0> juked LUL
[2:11:00] <AncelDeLambert> HL2 is so goddamned long, I don't envy Woolie having to stream it if he plans to
[2:11:01] <DarknessD42> LUL
[2:11:08] <+BNPhone> LUL
[2:11:29] <@Solidus_113> NICE
[2:11:30] <Zeemod155> LUL
[2:11:32] <VJdarkworld> HOLY
[2:11:34] <%RioGascar> Hl2 is about as long as half life 1
[2:11:34] <AncelDeLambert> CLIP IT
[2:11:41] <%DensityD> freeman is fed
[2:11:41] <%Haarute> the REAL barrel roll
[2:11:46] <%RyTYoung> PHYSICS
[2:11:50] <%Synthos3> HL2 is longer, no?
[2:11:54] <AncelDeLambert> it's way longer
[2:12:02] <Melchior_the_Wise> both are about 20ish hours long
[2:12:04] <venomfury86> LUL
[2:12:06] <AncelDeLambert> if you add all the 2.0 stuff, it's longer
[2:12:10] <licketysplit123> nah it's the same length.
[2:12:10] <Lancaster_H> only the boat and car sections of hl2 are needlessly long
[2:12:13] <+Freeborg1997> @Synthos3 HL2 is only longer if you count the episodes
[2:12:14] <Gelphaze> AWW barrels coming for me!
[2:12:17] <jasonisgold79> I don't think you can blow up the truck
[2:12:18] <lotharrio> You just saved and you're playing a scientist. Might as well experiment with that truck.
[2:12:19] <Melchior_the_Wise> not including ep1 and ep 2
[2:12:20] <%Javaa01> It's not, but it's the reason there's a ton of barrels around, they were refueling from it
[2:12:23] <licketysplit123> I like the car section honestly
[2:12:25] <cheesedburgers> The boat and car make 2 feel longer than it is
[2:12:28] <XeroSigmaPrime> Yea Half Life 2 isnt that long BUT theres alot of branching paths on the Coast, boat, and capital raid
[2:12:30] <%Synthos3> Nova Prospect takes a long time
[2:12:53] <@Solidus_113> you want that in HL2
[2:12:53] <%Javaa01> They're very full explosive barrels
[2:12:54] <%RioGascar> you can pick up anything
[2:12:55] <Psyramics> "too much fun" that's the premise of HL2
[2:12:57] <Melchior_the_Wise> Until gravity gun
[2:13:09] <Mangahero18> I forget does HL1 have Gravity Gun?
[2:13:12] <Psyramics> no
[2:13:12] <%RioGascar> No
[2:13:13] <licketysplit123> nah
[2:13:14] <@Solidus_113> no
[2:13:14] <Lancaster_H> no
[2:13:16] <%Synthos3> nope
[2:13:20] <@Solidus_113> HL1 didn't even have physics
[2:13:22] <jasonisgold79> "They can blow up the Damn, Damn for all I care! Damnit!"
[2:13:24] <unit24> oh no the framerate
[2:13:28] <+DreyfussFrost> No that was HL2's whole thing.
[2:13:29] <BurdRightsActivist> I don't find hl2 very replayable with all the "cutscenes" that are 5 minutes of standing and listening
[2:13:39] <Melchior_the_Wise> can someone mod the gravity gun into Black Mesa
[2:13:43] <AncelDeLambert> ... huh
[2:13:48] <Psyramics> watch a speedrunner go through them and use the same tricks
[2:13:51] <AncelDeLambert> sandvich!
[2:13:52] <lotharrio> Hats are made out of fruit rollups.
[2:13:52] <%Synthos3> @BurdRightsActivist You can balance things on peoples head during those scenes
[2:13:52] <stanlychicken> HL1 had gib physics
[2:13:53] <+Rabbitmage> stolen valor
[2:13:54] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> what do the hats do?
[2:13:55] <%RioGascar> they break up the pacing perfectly i find
[2:13:56] <licketysplit123> I like the story and characters in HL2 so it doesn't bother me
[2:14:05] <%The_Timo> Arnold reference ;p;
[2:14:06] <AncelDeLambert> @EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries apparently they regain health
[2:14:08] <%GeneralSCPatton> That is so goofy
[2:14:09] <+devonoel> what up chat? we in surface tension?
[2:14:13] <BurdRightsActivist> @Synthos3 You can choose to noclip to the next level instead 4Head
[2:14:17] <unit24> look everybody, we know there's only one mod woolie needs to play HL2 properly
[2:14:19] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> that's bizarre
[2:14:19] <unit24> Smod
[2:14:22] <rokxx> oh no
[2:14:23] <cheesedburgers> Half life and portal both have the thing where the sequel is much less replay able because of all the new story focus
[2:14:23] <AncelDeLambert> it really is
[2:14:25] <rokxx> the helicopter
[2:14:26] <XeroSigmaPrime> I feel like HL2's best moments far surpass Hl1 and BM but has wayyyy more sections that drag on
[2:14:30] <Tuna_Can_0> smod should be default
[2:14:31] <%RioGascar> The story enters at moments where you are just getting to a climax in combat or exploring
[2:14:40] <jasonisgold79> "Suppressive Fire, Insupressive Fire, do the Hokey Pokey and that's what it's all about!"
[2:14:43] <%GeneralSCPatton> @unit24 The Saga of Kickboat?
[2:14:50] <AncelDeLambert> HAHAHAHAHAAA

[2:14:59] <Tuna_Can_0> GabeN Gotcha
[2:15:01] <%Synthos3> Use the truck
[2:15:07] <rokxx> BLJ out of fence stuck
[2:15:07] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> just crouch jump out
[2:15:18] <%RioGascar> oh they changed this level
[2:15:23] <@Solidus_113> STYLIN
[2:15:23] <Tuna_Can_0> @XeroSigmaPrime shovel-chan disagrees
[2:15:25] <%RioGascar> before the fence was open I remember
[2:15:26] <BurdRightsActivist> PogChamp
[2:15:29] <licketysplit123> best part about HL2 is the little touches on the background. even the Combine chatter adds a lot. makes me <3 the Combine as antagonists.
[2:15:39] <XeroSigmaPrime> YEYEYEYEYAAAAAAAAAAAAA

[2:16:28] <Sundaysmiles01> LOL
[2:16:32] <unit24> this track is so good
[2:16:35] <Tuna_Can_0> @XeroSigmaPrime is that recent I've never played it
[2:16:35] <BurdRightsActivist> GET THEM MY PRETTIES
[2:16:43] <GarbageNirvana> Can you tell this music was made in the '90s
[2:16:53] <venomfury86> Amazing track

[2:17:08] <+BNPhone> can you tell this music want made in the 90s
[2:17:12] <%Synthos3> Smack my Vort up
[2:17:16] <%RioGascar> Some of it is a good remixing or reimagined version of the original ost
[2:17:17] <@Solidus_113> switching weapons is always faster than reloading
[2:17:22] <fruit_pie_the_magician> The antlion shit in 2 was cool
[2:17:23] <@Solidus_113> Y E E T
[2:17:25] <available_line> Wasn't the music also made by them now?
[2:17:26] <%Haarute> GO MY CHILDREN
[2:17:33] <datdemo> Antlions > Snarks
[2:17:34] <AncelDeLambert> I ended up using the satchel charges a ton, but I could NEVER make the fucking mines viable
[2:17:34] <XeroSigmaPrime> @This_is_Marco Yea, its changes are not as drastic, tries to maintain as much of the HL2 aesthetics as possible
[2:17:35] <Solid_Stro> The amount of chaos that happens in Doom Eternal is going to be so fun to watch
[2:17:41] <%RioGascar> Ohhhhhh they did chage the level
[2:17:42] <GarbageNirvana> Well whenever it was made it's something I'd expect to hear in the Blade soundtrack
[2:17:43] <jasonisgold79> Indeed
[2:17:45] <%RioGascar> to close the gate
[2:17:49] <BurdRightsActivist> I know the HECU are pretty much re-skinned combine, but did they change/fix their AI?
[2:17:51] <AncelDeLambert> you have to be on your second or third playthrough for the claymores to be worth a shit
[2:18:05] <%Haarute> we gucci
[2:18:07] <%RioGascar> they did change the hecu ai for 1.0
[2:18:07] <XeroSigmaPrime> @This_is_Marco Its more small improvements and changes to enhance combat, rather the big stuff Smod does
[2:18:08] <Tuna_Can_0> @XeroSigmaPrime just saw a trailer. I see what you mean :) smod is mostly for memes anyway
[2:18:12] <+BNPhone> pepeJAMMER
[2:18:18] <resloxxx> SourPls
[2:18:20] <jasonisgold79> @solid_stro Plus I can't wait to see them looking at the lore.
[2:18:21] <AncelDeLambert> oh damn, we Matrik
[2:18:25] <%RioGascar> Time for some SURFACE TENSION
[2:18:27] <XeroSigmaPrime> @This_is_Marco Oh hahah yea Smod is some funny cool shit for sure hahaha
[2:18:29] <+devonoel> Kreygasm this ost
[2:18:30] <Solid_Stro> This is Blade music
[2:18:32] <licketysplit123> I think this track was on BM back in 2012, but it is evoking the 98 soundtrack in HL1 in different ways.
[2:18:33] <AncelDeLambert> office building scene
[2:18:33] <+Taglog7> on this episode of dark table
[2:18:36] <@Solidus_113> Dam a fuck
[2:18:37] <cheesedburgers> God I love when the game reminds you it has a soundtrack and it rules
[2:18:40] <Lancaster_H> Clubbed to Death
[2:18:42] <GarbageNirvana> AAAH got struck by lightning
[2:18:48] <+TheFabledAble> Woolie only prays when he sprays it seems
[2:18:49] <venomfury86> Can't wait for Devil Games Part 2
[2:18:54] <%RioGascar> the sound track in half life alyx is GOD LIKE
[2:19:00] <AncelDeLambert> okay, time to drag out the Tau Gun for some anti-material fun
[2:19:03] <BurdRightsActivist> Just run at him 4Head
[2:19:08] <%doomerskeletor13> Half Life Alyx is nuts man
[2:19:08] <%RioGascar> like god damn mike morasky and kelly bailey killed it
[2:19:24] <datdemo> they're back on Alyx?
[2:19:27] <datdemo> sweet
[2:19:28] <unit24> this encounter is soooo much better in 1.0
[2:19:29] <BurdRightsActivist> @RioGascar Kelly Bailley didn't do the Black Mesa OST
[2:19:33] <XeroSigmaPrime> I love Alyx cause by the mechanics, you're no where close as OP as in HL2, but still makes you feel godlike
[2:19:34] <%Haarute> you're full on energy ammo
[2:19:38] <unit24> previously all of the soldiers would be dead before the drop
[2:19:41] <%RioGascar> no he didnt he helped with alyx tho
[2:20:06] <%RioGascar> at least helping mike morasky do a half life sounding soundtrack
[2:20:16] <BurdRightsActivist> WATER
[2:20:16] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @jasonisgold79
[2:20:18] <+Rabbitmage> SNAAAAAKE
[2:20:21] <AncelDeLambert> Tau gun!
[2:20:24] <BurdRightsActivist> JUMP!
[2:20:30] <+BNPhone> i wanna see the helicopter go into da watuh
[2:20:36] <Tucker0603> hit the water
[2:20:42] <%RioGascar> Joel nealson did the black mesa ost and his music is very good but i dont always think the implementation is good
[2:20:45] <%Haarute> try the tau cannon
[2:20:47] <Tuna_Can_0> crowbar copter PogChamp
[2:20:51] <venomfury86> Yup, too calm
[2:20:53] <%Javaa01> You can fight the chopper off, but you need to be good at aiming to be able to do that
[2:20:56] <@Solidus_113> Helicopter is your current Mr X
[2:21:01] <AlbertoRobert> you can totally fight it if you want
[2:21:04] <%GeneralSCPatton> TAU CANNON, ANTI-MATERIAL
[2:21:07] <unit24> I think the soundtrack and the implementation of it is overall a lot better in xen
[2:21:09] <+BNPhone> The music popping randomly in Black Mesa is like watching a shitty AMV
[2:21:21] <unit24> it's more consistent to be sure
[2:21:24] <jasonisgold79> "Shark!"
[2:21:26] <Tuna_Can_0> ow bullets
[2:21:29] <derap41> Still comming
[2:21:33] <%Synthos3> something like a shark
[2:21:37] <@Solidus_113> Crossbow works in water
[2:21:41] <lotharrio> Crossbow works underwater
[2:21:41] <Sundaysmiles01> lol
[2:21:42] <%Javaa01> Go into the tube
[2:21:43] <unit24> crossbow is good for water
[2:21:44] <+BNPhone> crossy and glock
[2:21:52] <BurdRightsActivist> This is getting out of hand, now there are two of them
[2:21:54] <%RioGascar> revover also works underwater if I remember
[2:21:57] <unit24> so is the glock actually
[2:21:59] <%Synthos3> get up
[2:22:02] <BlackMage66652> @unit24 They said the next thing is to go back and polish the rest of the game to be more like how Xen is
[2:22:03] <%GeneralSCPatton> Crossbow is THE aquatic weapon
[2:22:05] <%Synthos3> get on up
[2:22:21] <shinelucid> glock op
[2:22:24] <%Synthos3> breached like a whale
[2:22:26] <datdemo> use the crossbow
[2:22:33] <AncelDeLambert> the pistol functions underwater?
[2:22:40] <Melchior_the_Wise> crossbow kills them in 2
[2:22:40] <Sundaysmiles01> yep
[2:22:41] <+einherjarvalk> pistol and crossbow work
[2:22:42] <%frunkAF> in Half Life they do
[2:22:43] <Sundaysmiles01> as does the crossbow
[2:22:48] <Sundaysmiles01> and explosives
[2:22:49] <AncelDeLambert> fuck these fish, btw
[2:22:53] <+BNPhone> KANSEI DORIFTO
[2:23:08] <%Synthos3> GOTEM
[2:23:20] <indominus_corgi> pistols work underwater the bullets dont travel as far
[2:23:23] <unit24> you were supposed to be taught this earlier but you accidentally skipped it the first time
[2:23:33] <%Javaa01> Outside of your crossbow, only your weakest weapons work underwater
[2:23:44] <@Solidus_113> "weakest"
[2:23:45] <indominus_corgi> in real life it works
[2:23:49] <@Solidus_113> Crowbar is STRONG
[2:23:49] <lotharrio> Obviously this is a watergun.
[2:23:51] <resloxxx> Closed chambers
[2:23:59] <+BNPhone> no explosions involved
[2:24:03] <Melchior_the_Wise> guns work underwater technically
[2:24:03] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1242929035937820672?s=20
[2:24:12] <%RioGascar> Well in real life some guns can work underwater just they get fucked hard
[2:24:14] <unit24> there's a ladder up one of the towers
[2:24:22] <%Javaa01> Check the towers
[2:24:26] <+Freeborg1997> A ladder
[2:24:27] <%DensityD> just like DMC 1
[2:24:34] <+Deano8817> who would win, aquaman or a glock
[2:24:39] <+DreyfussFrost> It's not the explosions water prevents (hence, depth charges), it's the combustion.
[2:24:49] <shinelucid> although they do cool effect irl
[2:24:49] <Melchior_the_Wise> glockuaman
[2:24:51] <%GeneralSCPatton> @deano8817 Aquaman with a glock
[2:24:54] <%emeraldskrull> woolieGASM
[2:24:56] <+BNPhone> aquaman would send a million sardines to block al the bullets
[2:25:03] <%GeneralSCPatton> @melchior_the_wise Yeyeye
[2:25:05] <%Synthos3> surface
[2:25:09] <%Synthos3> go up
[2:25:18] <+Deano8817> psaSmug
[2:25:27] <cache_22> Woolie VS... ladders
[2:25:27] <inz0mbiac> MIT graduate
[2:25:29] <BionicPulga> lol
[2:25:35] <BurdRightsActivist> SOURCE LADDERS + WATER WutFace
[2:25:54] <%Synthos3> wait, does he not have the Gluon gun?
[2:25:57] <%SirGO0SE> shaper1HOLDTHAT
[2:25:58] <%RioGascar> ladders arent exactly solved in alyx either
[2:26:00] <Melchior_the_Wise> Not yet
[2:26:01] <%Haarute> he's full on tau ammo.
[2:26:04] <+DreyfussFrost> Gluon gun is later.
[2:26:17] <bleugh> it breaks anyway lol
[2:26:19] <quesadiablo> door open?
[2:26:19] <BurdRightsActivist> Succ
[2:26:29] <+devonoel> the big succ
[2:26:31] <Edible_Enthusiasm> must've watered down the cement
[2:26:41] <unit24> I remember this part as the spot where the old mod version frequently crashed
[2:26:41] <+BNPhone> Ladders work like normal VR ladders in HL:A
[2:26:44] <Melchior_the_Wise> Hollow needle + Boy with good succ
[2:26:48] <+Deano8817> it took me way longer to figure that part out then woolz
[2:26:57] <BurdRightsActivist> You think this dam exists to power the facility?
[2:26:59] <jasonisgold79> "Well, I'll be Damned"
[2:27:02] <Mangahero18> did they ever say where the black mesa compound was located? I assume Nevada
[2:27:05] <%Synthos3> Woolie has a Greek Chorus pointing him in the right direction
[2:27:09] <+doc_ock_rokc> Where is the damn dam tour
[2:27:10] <+BNPhone> New Mexico
[2:27:11] <Lancaster_H> new mexico @Mangahero18
[2:27:11] <%RioGascar> Ehhhh they teleport you up too often in alyx for my liking
[2:27:11] <Melchior_the_Wise> I think New Mexico
[2:27:14] <+DreyfussFrost> @mangahero18 New Mexico
[2:27:17] <%Synthos3> New Mexico
[2:27:19] <Mangahero18> ah
[2:27:30] <@Solidus_113> COME KILL ME
[2:27:31] <@Solidus_113> DO IT
[2:27:33] <%Synthos3> If you go to Albuquerque airport, theres a Black Mesa Coffee
[2:27:46] <Melchior_the_Wise> actually?
[2:27:47] <+sir_louis> LUL
[2:27:49] <%Synthos3> For real
[2:27:50] <+doc_ock_rokc> @Synthos3 is it radioactive?
[2:27:52] <derap41> big evil
[2:27:54] <Mangahero18> OH THE DISRESPECT
[2:27:54] <AncelDeLambert> Woolie going full Predator
[2:27:55] <%RioGascar> black mesa is a real place
[2:28:01] <Blue2rocky> BETRAYAL!
[2:28:04] <+doc_ock_rokc> Yeah black mesa is a real place
[2:28:04] <%RioGascar> its just not a test facility
[2:28:10] <BurdRightsActivist> Just say you have uhh... 50 accounts of self-dense? Like plea innocent, the US army will listen!
[2:28:18] <available_line> This game look gorgeous compared ot HL1
[2:28:28] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Melchior_the_Wise
[2:28:29] <jasonisgold79> *Insert Freeman's Mind version of Modern Major General*
[2:28:32] <%RioGascar> Well half lfie 1 was 1998 on gold src
[2:28:43] <%Synthos3> https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/EMmKYjB0PPiqM7b9sNFP2A/348s.jpg
[2:28:44] <unit24> half life alyx has taught me just how big headcrabs are supposed to be
[2:28:44] <BionicPulga> Is Woolie playing Half-Life 2 after this?
[2:28:44] <jasonisgold79> That's still my fav moment from the series.
[2:28:46] <%RioGascar> this was 2012 in its early release
[2:28:55] <derap41> You have no ideqa
[2:28:58] <BurdRightsActivist> We done FUCKED IT UP
[2:28:58] <%Haarute> :)
[2:29:00] <+doc_ock_rokc> @BurdRightsActivist This Self Defense crap isn't cutting it because I never get to fire First!
[2:29:02] <+Deano8817> put them in a zoo and call it a day
[2:29:16] <resloxxx> No longer contained NotLikeThis
[2:29:19] <jasonisgold79> Oh, wait we're not there yet. Nevermind.
[2:29:20] <@Solidus_113> no it's all fucked
[2:29:29] <cheesedburgers> All this damage caused by one mine cart in a laser
[2:29:30] <+Slimshazbot> shit's baaaaaad
[2:29:32] <lotharrio> POORLY
[2:29:35] <%Javaa01> Well it makes zombies
[2:29:35] <Dr_Mooose> bad
[2:29:37] <Tsoulus> how would you contain teleporters
[2:29:38] <%doomerskeletor13> Seven Hour War baby
[2:29:38] <%Javaa01> So that's bad
[2:29:38] <Melchior_the_Wise> Very badly
[2:29:38] <%Haarute> ask ravenholm
[2:29:40] <%RioGascar> how do you CONTAIN teleportation
[2:29:43] <+doc_ock_rokc> @WoolieVersus They are Teleporting in randomly. What is to say it is ONLY at blackmesa
[2:29:47] <+Nogopharo> They belong in a MUSEUM
[2:29:51] <+DreyfussFrost> No Black Mesa handled this about as well as the U.S. handled the 'rona.
[2:29:52] <%Synthos3> Have you read Gyo by Junji Ito?
[2:29:52] <VJdarkworld> find out in Half Life Alyx HahaShrugMiddle
[2:29:52] <kinoreka> thats why the combine contained the humans in cities in hl2
[2:30:00] <%Synthos3> Thats how the headcrab integrates
[2:30:02] <Psyramics> Coyotes will tear them apart
[2:30:11] <Melchior_the_Wise> Headcrabs will eat coyotes, lo
[2:30:16] <Melchior_the_Wise> lol
[2:30:20] <%NovaKnightmare> the headcrab was designed for human heads, thus disproving evolution : )))))
[2:30:22] <%chiluzza> the bird that fucking spears wildlife on trees is probably gonna do just fine
[2:30:25] <Sundaysmiles01> Dogcrabs
[2:30:39] <Melchior_the_Wise> Dogcrabs sound really bad
[2:30:41] <Blue2rocky> @WoolieVersus what if the snakes ate the headcrabs...would we have zombie snakes or snakecrabs?
[2:30:41] <%Javaa01> You gotta go across the ledge
[2:30:43] <@Solidus_113> Headcrabs are Prometheus
[2:30:44] <%Synthos3> Ghost flag
[2:30:59] <@Solidus_113> Alien Covenant
[2:31:00] <%Javaa01> The door's locked
[2:31:14] <%NovaKnightmare> Freeman never learned to lockpick at MIT
[2:31:14] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:31:17] <%doomerskeletor13> Has Woolie played half life 2? I don’t wanna drop spoilers if he’s planning on playing that
[2:31:19] <+doc_ock_rokc> if only there was a way to get on the wall
[2:31:21] <Sullry> I’m pretty sure for a few months after the Mesa incident there were just random alien teleportation incidents before the combine invasion so regular ass people had to deal with headcrabs and whatever xen had
[2:31:25] <%Synthos3> he has not
[2:31:32] <Tsoulus> what do you mean he has not
[2:31:36] <Tsoulus> who hasnt played hl2 LOL
[2:31:37] <%Synthos3> played HL2
[2:31:42] <%RioGascar> At this point half life 2 feels guaranteed but not yet
[2:31:48] <%Synthos3> Woolie has not played HL2
[2:31:51] <CookieDoughFK> They was somthing you missed
[2:31:55] <%Javaa01> Gotta walk across the ledge of that concrete barrier and make it to the broken ladder
[2:31:56] <%RioGascar> you’d be surprised who hasnt played half life 2
[2:31:57] <%Chichen> @Tsoulus this is Woolie's first time with the series.
[2:31:59] <Dr_Mooose> hug that wall
[2:32:02] <@Solidus_113> Everything's eventually guaranteed
[2:32:03] <+doc_ock_rokc> If only there was a way to get on top of that wall from a higher area
[2:32:04] <Tsoulus> that is crazy @Chichen
[2:32:07] <+Deano8817> woolie was a fighting games dude, of course he wouldn't know HL2
[2:32:12] <%Chichen> @Tsoulus he never played PC games for a LONG time.
[2:32:12] <+Rabbitmage> murrica
[2:32:16] <datdemo> GOD BLESS AMERICA
[2:32:17] <resloxxx> Feel like a hero yet?
[2:32:18] <Tsoulus> ah
[2:32:19] <Dr_Mooose> KKona
[2:32:21] <+ItsRatman> Gordon Freeman IS a hero.
[2:32:23] <Kiraklene> :) 7
[2:32:26] <+linSP> hl2 is good, it’s not groundbreaking anymore tho
[2:32:26] <%RioGascar> Woolie played portal and portal 2 tho
[2:32:27] <@Solidus_113> Do you feel like a Scientist yet?
[2:32:28] <+ItsRatman> debatably
[2:32:29] <BurdRightsActivist> I don't feel like a hero ):
[2:32:31] <lotharrio> That the FLAG! WAS! STILL! THERE!
[2:32:38] <Melchior_the_Wise> Killing so many marines
[2:32:43] <%doomerskeletor13> Freedom isn’t free, no there’s a hefty fucking fee
[2:32:46] <%Javaa01> Don't go backwards
[2:32:46] <licketysplit123> Marc Laidlaw said it was a matter of days in between HL1 and the war so earth was doubly fucked
[2:32:53] <Tsoulus> not backwards :D
[2:33:01] <%RioGascar> it was not matter of days
[2:33:02] <%The_Timo> "No no no that's not it" Continues to go backwards... ?
[2:33:06] <%RioGascar> It was matter of hours
[2:33:09] <@Solidus_113> There's a small path on the first ladder
[2:33:15] <%RioGascar> 7 hours
[2:33:22] <Lancaster_H> the war is 7 hours
[2:33:25] <Psyramics> i thought that was how long the war lasted
[2:33:26] <+Estuko> anyone have lego worlds, trying to see if the classic space/monsters dlc is any worth.
[2:33:28] <%doomerskeletor13> Yeah Half Life 2 expand son what happened during this incident
[2:33:29] <Lancaster_H> hl1 to the war is couple days
[2:33:29] <+Slimshazbot> @RioGascar Between The Black Mesa incident and the war, not the war itself
[2:33:41] <+Rabbitmage> tremors
[2:33:42] <Tsoulus> it is even painted with plot yellow!
[2:33:42] <%RioGascar> Agh
[2:33:44] <@Solidus_113> lots of explosions
[2:33:44] <licketysplit123> No I mean after HL1, it was just a few days before the Combine came and the 7 Hour War happened.
[2:33:44] <+TopTieramisu> expand, son
[2:34:07] <%doomerskeletor13> LUL
[2:34:08] <Lancaster_H> and thats only because Combine took Xen first
[2:34:08] <Dr_Mooose> damn
[2:34:12] <%DensityD> good shotty friend
[2:34:16] <Lancaster_H> because nihilanth was gone
[2:34:28] <+Rabbitmage> doggos
[2:34:30] <%DensityD> lessons from BRs
[2:34:30] <licketysplit123> So earth didn't even get a chance to adjust before Combine fucked us over even more.
[2:34:35] <Enderou> "alright everybody so i shot the fucking dog down across the way"
[2:34:35] <%DensityD> big apex lessons
[2:34:48] <Tsoulus> really enjoyed black mesa; kept the good out with the bad
[2:34:49] <%Javaa01> Reload your shit, always
[2:34:52] <BurdRightsActivist> Okay question, we're worried about the headcrabs entering the enviroment but what about these lil chucklefucks?
[2:34:56] <@Solidus_113> It's the Helicopter
[2:34:59] <+Estuko> I feel like switching gun to save time on reload is a much earlier game lesson lol
[2:35:01] <%doomerskeletor13> Nah man the Combine saved earth from the xen monsters Kappa
[2:35:07] <XeroSigmaPrime> Raising the Bar established that is was ambiguous how soon the & hour War started after Black Mesa.
[2:35:07] <CookieDoughFK> sound your foot steps
[2:35:09] <%RioGascar> Well if half life 2 lore is to go off of
[2:35:12] <Tsoulus> maybe it is correlated to the free pornhub premium world wide
[2:35:13] <+BNPhone> Spend the Gauss is you got it
[2:35:20] <%RioGascar> combine eleminate the hound eyes
[2:35:31] <%RioGascar> and weaponize headcrabs
[2:35:34] <dukenux> So i have missed the cliff battle part?
[2:35:36] <licketysplit123> i like the headcanon that Houndeyes were just aggressive due to fear
[2:35:40] <+linSP> Gordon is G...
[2:35:41] <%LordSDB> There a rope ever there to
[2:35:44] <+BNPhone> nope @dukenux
[2:35:47] <@Solidus_113> that's progression
[2:35:47] <+Superbro64> so freeman kills the nihilith, combine sees the opportunity immediately and takes hold of xen, walts through the resonance cascade or portal or whatever and takes over erf? Is that the timeline?
[2:35:51] <dukenux> @xx123manxx sick
[2:36:09] <%GeneralSCPatton> Why y'all talkin' bout spoilers?
[2:36:10] <XeroSigmaPrime> @Superbro64 basically
[2:36:13] <+Rabbitmage> no spoilers plz
[2:36:14] <dukenux> this level actually reminds me of antlion level in HL2
[2:36:19] <Lancaster_H> @Superbro64 in very simple terms more or less
[2:36:24] <XeroSigmaPrime> @GeneralSCPatton Bro HL2 came out ages ago lol
[2:36:24] <%Javaa01> It's blocked off
[2:36:25] <@Solidus_113> blocked off
[2:36:29] <licketysplit123> yeah we should stop about HL2 lol
[2:36:30] <dukenux> or other way around
[2:36:35] <%RioGascar> @licketysplit123 The original cannon was they were friendly but during playtesting back in beta they kept instantly shooting them. So they became enemies
[2:36:39] <+Superbro64> apologies on that one chat
[2:36:41] <BurdRightsActivist> @lewdskeletor13 The combine baby suppression field only exists to keep us away from sex, so we can all become Dantes and Leons.
[2:36:44] <%GeneralSCPatton> @xerosigmaprime And Woolz hasn't played it
[2:36:47] <%doomerskeletor13> @xerosigmaprime It’s more for Woolies sake
[2:36:48] <+doc_ock_rokc> @Superbro64 yeah pretty much and combine MAY have hried G
[2:36:52] <CookieDoughFK> Its probably welded
[2:36:54] <dukenux> Kappa too bad
[2:37:02] <Tsoulus> definitely welded and super glued
[2:37:04] <Lancaster_H> theres also the whole reason combine looking to earth tying into Portal and Borealis which I wont go into
[2:37:04] <Tsoulus> you stand no chance
[2:37:06] <+DreyfussFrost> Interactables in HL are usually red. White stuff is typically non-interactable.
[2:37:08] <XeroSigmaPrime> @GeneralSCPatton Its a good thing he purposely avoids the chat for that reason during streams hahah
[2:37:23] <%NovaKnightmare> valves are the way forward, subtle
[2:37:25] <%RioGascar> He still reads chat tho
[2:37:26] <licketysplit123> @riogascar yeah I know, i will never forgive the playtesters :(((
[2:37:28] <%Javaa01> Don't lick the fence
[2:37:47] <+doc_ock_rokc> yes
[2:37:47] <BurdRightsActivist> LET ME INNN
[2:37:49] <%LordSDB> @Tsoulus For some reason I read that as dual weilding glue guns
[2:37:50] <%RioGascar> i think valves playtesters have made some amazing decisions
[2:37:51] <VJdarkworld> DAAMN
[2:38:02] <fruit_pie_the_magician> You whizzed on the electric fence, didn't ya?
[2:38:02] <jasonisgold79> Ya gota hold tje wheel Woolie
[2:38:08] <AncelDeLambert> LUL
[2:38:12] <BionicPulga> Haha
[2:38:17] <+TopTieramisu> you can do it :)
[2:38:17] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:38:18] <+doc_ock_rokc> Stop wizzing on the Fence
[2:38:20] <%doomerskeletor13> Pee on it like Norman Reedus would
[2:38:23] <dukenux> You can attempt stacking barrels
[2:38:23] <AncelDeLambert> kill yourself on the fence!
[2:38:24] <+BNPhone> Crouch Jump King
[2:38:29] <+Estuko> BZZZT
[2:38:32] <cache_22> Woolie hates progress.
[2:38:36] <%The_Timo> Fucking crippling Fomo
[2:38:48] <Tsoulus> nein!
[2:38:52] <venomfury86> LUL
[2:38:52] <%RioGascar> boy alyx has lots of that
[2:39:00] <%doomerskeletor13> That’s pretty much every Valve game
[2:39:02] <BlackMage66652> What the hell is fomo
[2:39:08] <AncelDeLambert> for real FOMO is a disease
[2:39:09] <Tsoulus> fear of missing out
[2:39:10] <%doomerskeletor13> Fear of missing out
[2:39:10] <+linSP> how DARE they advance the game
[2:39:20] <%RioGascar> if theres a drop off you will know that is progression blocker
[2:39:31] <dukenux> I have that
[2:39:37] <%The_Timo> He's afraid he missed out on a single health pick up I guess?
[2:39:41] <Tsoulus> humans have it
[2:39:45] <+Superbro64> wait. is FOMO why woolie thinks the world knowing something you dont isnt worth a million dollars?
[2:39:45] <@Solidus_113> FOMO is how F2P games get you to keep coming back to play
[2:39:50] <@Solidus_113> battle passes
[2:39:51] <%The_Timo> Oh Woolie's case is a crippling version though lol
[2:39:52] <%SirGO0SE> i have fear of making out
[2:39:53] <+Superbro64> thats an insane take woolie. Insane
[2:39:53] <@Solidus_113> and such
[2:39:56] <dukenux> i think im actuallly too obsessive on squeezing ALL the content in a game
[2:40:05] <dukenux> on a first playthrought
[2:40:12] <Tsoulus> could you have a houndeye as a pet?
[2:40:18] <dukenux> they just want pets :)
[2:40:19] <Tsoulus> I line in an appartment
[2:40:22] <+DreyfussFrost> @superbro64 Yes, and I wouldn't take that deal either. I'd literally go insane.
[2:40:29] <+Superbro64> ??
[2:40:32] <dukenux> nope
[2:40:35] <+Superbro64> A million dollars
[2:40:37] <%RioGascar> i would not want a houndeye pet
[2:40:40] <+Superbro64> a MILLION dollars
[2:40:43] <+DreyfussFrost> Not worth my sanity.
[2:40:43] <+BNPhone> well theres OpFor but thats GoldSrc
[2:40:52] <Tsoulus> definitely a good pet; you can bring it to raves
[2:40:54] <+Superbro64> you wouldnt take A MILLION dollars.
[2:40:58] <+DreyfussFrost> I'd be miserable.
[2:40:59] <@Solidus_113> alt progression
[2:41:02] <%doomerskeletor13> Fuck Point Prime breebuPog
[2:41:05] <+Superbro64> you're crazy
[2:41:14] <AncelDeLambert> quick question: were the [REDACTED] variants found in zen in the original version of the game, or are they BM inventions?
[2:41:15] <+DreyfussFrost> I wouldn't be able to enjoy it while obsessing over what the secret is.
[2:41:25] <XeroSigmaPrime> a MILLION DOLLARS is useless if youre FUCKING DEAD
[2:41:26] <%Javaa01> Yes
[2:41:30] <+Superbro64> the world knows TONS of things you dont already.
[2:41:31] <Decsevm> wait a second this isn't Freeman's Mind
[2:41:32] <AncelDeLambert> okay, thanks
[2:41:34] <%RioGascar> No ancel they are special to black mesa
[2:41:36] <unit24> these paths lead to the same place, this one just has stuff on the way
[2:41:44] <Zfungus03> The fabled Mountain Dew cave
[2:41:46] <+Deano8817> @AncelDeLambert if you mean the doggos, I think they're new to BM
[2:41:49] <+linSP> the secret for taking a million dollars is you’re a dummy for not taking the million dollars
[2:41:50] <+DreyfussFrost> Yes but I COULD find out if I really, *really* wanted to.
[2:41:55] <+Superbro64> arent there like 8 wonders of the world we literally dont know what they are or something?
[2:41:55] <%Javaa01> You missed four of those shots
[2:41:57] <%Haarute> you're aiming at their feet.
[2:41:58] <CookieDoughFK> you missed most of the shots
[2:41:59] <%Javaa01> Completely
[2:42:00] <+Superbro64> You all are insane
[2:42:01] <Tsoulus> xen is very different
[2:42:01] <dukenux> shit, i think i never been in that cave
[2:42:13] <dukenux> It's not radioactive, its just Mtn Dew
[2:42:21] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> The bugs have an alt fire I think?
[2:42:23] <%Haarute> they're very safe.
[2:42:24] <AncelDeLambert> use them against troops, Woolz
[2:42:24] <BlackMage66652> Throw a million of them at once
[2:42:25] <dukenux> Distraction
[2:42:25] <+linSP> Forbidden dew
[2:42:27] <@Solidus_113> you have to throw them first
[2:42:27] <Fenlig> Good fun in multiplayer
[2:42:30] <@Solidus_113> before fights
[2:42:42] <%Javaa01> They do go for them, but they usually nade them
[2:42:42] <+DreyfussFrost> You throw a ton and hide.
[2:42:46] <YakumoYomi> @dukenux Isn't Mountain Dew radioactive, though?
[2:42:52] <Tsoulus> I never went this way
[2:42:58] <Tsoulus> cool
[2:43:01] <dukenux> alt path
[2:43:03] <dukenux> neat
[2:43:33] <+Estuko> Hole in your brain, that reminded me of that one... very specific brain toy.
[2:43:35] <+Superbro64> Thats a take as stupid as "You get a million dollars, but that frame on your wall will be off by a degree permanently"
[2:43:42] <dukenux> opened some hatches
[2:43:47] <%The_Timo> One of the games I'm working on has a ton of branching and alternate paths.. Woolie would hate it lol
[2:43:48] <+DreyfussFrost> No that's totally fine.
[2:43:50] <+Superbro64> your brain is preventing you from getting EASY cash money
[2:44:03] <+DreyfussFrost> Ok but money doesn't make you happy.
[2:44:06] <Tsoulus> with one million dollars you can build a house that tilts 1 degree
[2:44:12] <BlackMage66652> The marines have great voice work in BM, that's for sure
[2:44:13] <dukenux> yeah, that's me :)
[2:44:17] <+DreyfussFrost> I wouldn't take a deal that GUARANTEES misery.
[2:44:21] <+Superbro64> I literally will have to work at my job for 10 plus years for a million.

[2:45:04] <dukenux> Yes
[2:45:06] <derap41> Power of cocaine
[2:45:07] <+DreyfussFrost> Well that's the thing about that deal. It's not a deal to know the secret, it's a deal to not have the secret.
[2:45:13] <%RioGascar> it was made in a way to alow for any voice lines to exist

[2:46:22] <Tsoulus> 100 years of universal salary
[2:46:38] <+Superbro64> Not knowing does not physically effect you in any meaningful way, compared to shitting your pants if a baby cries for the REST OF YOUR LIFE
[2:46:48] <+Superbro64> I will continue to say that your insane
[2:46:51] <theKingRamses> definately not that giant glowing door

[2:47:06] <oceanmatt> the big red lights with the alarm
[2:47:30] <+DreyfussFrost> Solitary confinement involves no physical injury but over extreme lengths of time can be considered torture.

[3:09:22] <+waltzqueen> LUL
[3:09:23] <%Chichen> @WoolieVersus it follows your mouse
[3:09:24] <worldbrand> btw when you hide behind the rock, your laser is on the rock
[3:09:24] <%Javaa01> Yeah don't point the laser at your face
[3:09:26] <Davimotion96> IT CAME BACK
[3:09:26] <Tucker0603> Really woolz LUL LUL LUL
[3:09:26] <+doc_ock_rokc> Its MOUSE guided
[3:09:27] <%FuqBoiSlim> man....
[3:09:28] <%RioGascar> The rocket launcher is VERY different to any rocket launcher
[3:09:28] <%Toxicjok3r1209> you guide by aiming
[3:09:28] <AncelDeLambert> woolie has to aim, we're all gonna die
[3:09:29] <%Haarute> you aiming at yourself and it came back
[3:09:31] <SkySpy> xD laser on rock it swung back on you
[3:09:35] <Zeemod155> If you aim at your own cover it comes back to you LUL
[3:09:38] <Sundaysmiles01> so if you DUCK behind a rock, guess where the rocket's gonna go
[3:09:38] <%FuqBoiSlim> woolie you have to shoot them
[3:09:41] <GarbageNirvana> I thought that was his own missile coming back at him
[3:09:43] <KillMyPast> You aimed at yourself
[3:09:46] <CookieDoughFK> Your own rocked was guided back at you and it almost killed you
[3:09:50] <+Superbro64> is the helicopter NOT the test itself?
[3:09:59] <Goraka91> If you're looking at your cover guess what
[3:10:05] <%Haarute> you can BOOMERANG
[3:10:06] <+doc_ock_rokc> If you hide behind rock it will GO TOWARD ROCK
[3:10:07] <derap41> Its really dangerous too
[3:10:16] <mMayrro> oh boy
[3:10:17] <%RioGascar> its a bit of an extreme test honestly
[3:10:18] <Melchior_the_Wise> Don't look at cover though
[3:10:20] <mMayrro> OH BOY
[3:10:25] <jasonisgold79> "Oh my god it's a Rocket Launcher. The perfect gift for the man who has everything."
[3:10:25] <%Javaa01> Yeah this is a fun rocket launcher, just don't point the laser at yourself
[3:10:29] <%Javaa01> You will kill yourself
[3:10:29] <theKingRamses> don't look at something next to you though
[3:10:30] <%GeneralSCPatton> COVER IS BAD NOW
[3:10:33] <Tuna_Can_0> this was great in DM
[3:10:33] <+Markmeltzer> @WoolieVersus Dont aim the laser behind your own cover
[3:10:34] <dukenux> High risk, high reward
[3:10:39] <SlappyMeats> "Aim Away from Face" printed on it
[3:10:43] <+ItsRatman> okay now do it better
[3:10:43] <@Solidus_113> you turned off guidance
[3:10:45] <Melchior_the_Wise> it wasn't on

[3:11:40] <+BNPhone> it was in hl1
[3:11:48] <dukenux> It was always toggle
[3:11:49] <gluemanofficial> Rocket jumping isnt in this game
[3:11:49] <BurdRightsActivist> toggle laser
[3:12:01] <%RioGascar> Also this feature was so mind blowing back in 1998
[3:12:04] <CookieDoughFK> You get the feeling this game wasn't designed for controller levels of precision
[3:12:12] <%RioGascar> Cause quakes rocket launchers were like ROCKET JUMP
[3:12:16] <+BNPhone> well woolie is aiming with the mouse

[3:13:23] <%Javaa01> This type of tracking is basically unique to Half Life
[3:13:24] <theKingRamses> laser guiding like this is a half life thing as far as i'm aware
[3:13:27] <+Superbro64> step 1) shoot. step 2) move and shoot. step 3) move and jump and shoot
[3:13:35] <+Superbro64> one step at a time guys :)

[3:21:21] <%NovaKnightmare> you can sneak up on em, but ur light is on
[3:21:24] <dukenux> plus you gotta be FAST
[3:21:34] <StarlitStunner> The tunnel protects, the tunnel provides. It’s the safest place, that’s what the TMNT taught me.
[3:21:41] <%Haarute> flashlight alerts enemies
[3:21:45] <NevikGamina> yaeh your flashlight gave you away
[3:22:05] <noyjatat> turn off the flashlight

[3:23:04] <mMayrro> the tank has machine guns btw
[3:23:18] <mMayrro> not one but two
[3:23:21] <+slimmixrp> Turn your flashlight ogg
[3:23:22] <+slimmixrp> *off
[3:23:25] <AppleBerryKitty> Dang it! I was almost done watching the past black mesa steams!...... doodStare
[3:23:32] <Mike_Mc> through grenades from down below?
[3:23:36] <+Superbro64> do I have 6
[3:23:36] <dukenux> run behind it
[3:23:48] <unit24> there's a tunnel that leads to a flanking position
[3:23:53] <asurite_warrior> bugs
[3:23:53] <%Javaa01> Yes
[3:23:53] <Clyderso> Black Mesa needs more Vanquish
[3:23:56] <Sundaysmiles01> Two satchel charges should kill it
[3:23:57] <%Javaa01> Absolutely
[3:23:57] <mMayrro> give them your small backpacks :)
[3:24:00] <asurite_warrior> use zee bugs
[3:24:01] <NevikGamina> yeah they can notice your flashlight
[3:24:05] <%SirGO0SE> yes
[3:24:07] <+BNPhone> shall i give you dis pear
[3:24:23] <+Superbro64> Do I have 7.
[3:24:39] <+BNPhone> just peek from the ladder and take out the dudes
[3:24:44] <@Solidus_113> you also still have 3 SMG grenades
[3:24:44] <+sir_louis> That American hero cactus taking a rocket for the troops
[3:24:56] <theKingRamses> there was a dumpster up one of these ladders that looked like it was blocking shots
[3:25:21] <+doc_ock_rokc> @sir_louis do your duty! Hug a cactus today!
[3:25:24] <Sundaysmiles01> If I remember correctly, there is a tunnel which opens up behind the tank
[3:25:39] <+Superbro64> That tank sure has a surplus of rounds to servo
[3:26:04] <dukenux> there was in Half-Life
[3:26:32] <Sundaysmiles01> You cal slide Satchel charges underneath the tank as well
[3:26:35] <AppleBerryKitty> wooo love the lighting
[3:26:35] <@Solidus_113> I think your constant auto-sprint is making noise too
[3:26:37] <%Haarute> if you're going to shoot don't stand still in open field, get cover
[3:26:40] <@Solidus_113> the AI is really smart
[3:26:45] <dukenux> @WoolieVersus if you get behind it you can also use satchels
[3:26:49] <+Superbro64> Do I have 8.
[3:26:54] <ReyThePCPlayer> this is brutal
[3:27:06] <@Solidus_113> use satchels from here
[3:27:08] <%jepupu> This has now become Super Meat Gordon level.
[3:27:13] <MassConnect> I honestly would reload before the tank appeared and not put yourself in an inferior position down ladders
[3:27:15] <EDFscout> The flank tunnel next to the ladder?
[3:27:16] <+DreyfussFrost> Oh yeah, hearing was always a thing in Half-life. Auto-sprint would give you away.
[3:27:16] <ReyThePCPlayer> surprising to see this is the easiest difficulty
[3:27:23] <Zfungus03> Use targeting out of the window ?

[3:28:43] <Sundaysmiles01> Get upclose to the tank
[3:28:53] <%SirGO0SE> shoot up then bring rocket down
[3:29:08] <SuperFightinRobot> I have done some research, doesn't seem like flashlight matters. Agro is based almost entirely on line of sight for ranged enemies and proximity for melee ones.
[3:29:11] <theKingRamses> probably better off eating their grenades from the hut

[3:31:01] <MassConnect> did I hear an alarm?
[3:31:22] <dukenux> check if theres like a manhole behind the tank
[3:31:41] <+doc_ock_rokc> @ReyThePCPlayer because you are wearing the most tracked suit ever

[3:32:43] <%Haarute> gordon freeman just went to work today man
[3:32:44] <+doc_ock_rokc> SCIENCE MAN KILLS A TANK
[3:32:48] <SuperFightinRobot> Gordon is wearing the perfect tank outfit. It draws agro from the entire planet and makes him invincible from the neck down.
[3:32:49] <Dr_Mooose> and a helicopter
[3:32:49] <AncelDeLambert> they DO mention that he's fully trained with weaponry
[3:32:49] <Tuna_Can_0> gordan is simple science man with crowbar
[3:32:50] <+Superbro64> 10 deaths. Not as many deaths as I thought. Good stuff Woolie.
[3:32:53] <Fenlig> Gordon grew up in a harsh neighborhood
[3:32:55] <SlappyMeats> Gotta be the shoes

[3:33:05] <candidateplays> The right man in the wrong place can make all the difference in the world
[3:33:05] <@Solidus_113> Gordon was the only man who watched Anime
[3:33:08] <%Haarute> he woke up this morning thinking "man i can't wait to do some science today"
[3:33:09] <+unclekulikov> Live Freeman, or Die Hard
[3:33:11] <%doomerskeletor13> He’s just that cool
[3:33:14] <%The_Timo> Still think Gordon is an escaped experiment who believes he used to work there
[3:33:15] <stormhawk9891> It's a REALLY good suit
[3:33:17] <+stef5949> Apperently Gordon got training in weapons to use with the HEV suit
[3:33:18] <theKingRamses> ponytail was his limiter
[3:33:31] <ReyThePCPlayer> this nerd screwed a lot of tge army's wives. that's my only explanation

[3:35:25] <+atin2000> like, cardboard
[3:35:27] <unit24> maybe find a way to fuck with the analog stick sensitivity?
[3:35:30] <Mike_Mc> try a meal tray, something with legs that is raised up higher
[3:35:32] <NaturalGear> but the gamer cube is a pussy magnet
[3:35:34] <%generalve> Rip woolies joints
[3:35:35] <SomersaultJustice> make reggie play it
[3:35:35] <Ahk_90> the cube is love. the cube is life
[3:35:36] <StarlitStunner> Become an orb in a cube. And buy an Elmo. This is the way.
[3:35:37] <+slimmixrp> Get a lap mat
[3:35:39] <Fenlig> Put the mouse on Reggies thigh ;)
[3:35:42] <derap41> Its not so bad for most games anyway this one is kinda not working because it doesn't have autoaim asist
[3:35:43] <Pappajimbo> get a cardboard box aka the free gamer cube
[3:35:45] <RAPHCOM> @superbro64 That is the dumbest idea I ever heard...I love it!!!!
[3:35:45] <Lancaster_H> yeah everyone just imagine the last 20 minutes with controller aiming
[3:35:45] <+slimmixrp> Dont need a whole cube
[3:35:47] <Torgue_1> That means it's working
[3:35:48] <ReyThePCPlayer> does this game really not have proper auto aim for controller users
[3:35:50] <+ChaoticWaha> Could try getting sa vertical mouse
[3:35:52] <clonexsniper> pillow with a mouse pad?
[3:35:54] <SlappyMeats> just sit on a pile of money
[3:35:58] <+Superbro64> oh, woolie WAS using a mouse.
[3:36:05] <AMaidIndeed> GAMER CUBE GAMER CUBE GAMER CUBE
[3:36:07] <@Solidus_113> You can use a big arcade stick
[3:36:10] <+AmanDotZip> there are plenty of vids on how to aim
[3:36:11] <unit24> woolie how far down are you reaching to touch the mouse?
[3:36:11] <arkv01> yeah don't let the video game work you, you make it work fo you
[3:36:12] <+Superbro64> Huh. Never played mouse on a couch. Sounds like hell.
[3:36:13] <+AmanDotZip> youve def improved
[3:36:14] <Melchior_the_Wise> big arcade stick, lol
[3:36:15] <derap41> A gamer box instead of oa cube smart
[3:36:35] <Tucker0603> @woolieversus word from the wise, make sure it isn't to high up either, that will fuck up your shoulder
[3:36:37] <%Haarute> use reggie's back as a mouse surface
[3:36:38] <RAPHCOM> What’s the PC gaming version of HitBox?
[3:36:45] <Melchior_the_Wise> Steam Controller
[3:36:47] <+Superbro64> what about those tv dinner desk things?
[3:36:52] <+Superbro64> would those work?
[3:36:52] <+slimmixrp> They have laptop trays you could use
[3:36:56] <dukenux> he was using both a mouse AND the analog stick
[3:36:59] <MassConnect> plug any controller into your pc
[3:37:03] <@Solidus_113> Hitbox variant would be the Razer mini keyboards
[3:37:04] <MassConnect> it's all usb
[3:37:08] <+BNPhone> i hated keyboard too, but hey not tht bad
[3:37:15] <+Flambage> @WoolieVersus You can get one of those bed lap tables
[3:37:18] <derap41> Its a good comprimise
[3:37:19] <dukenux> Didn't Pat buy one and then never used it?
[3:37:24] <Mike_Mc> I have tendonitis in both my wrists, the elbows are the key. I only get pain in my thumb joints when I use controllers
[3:37:28] <Melchior_the_Wise> I heard it's weird to get used to, but when you do it's better for these types of games
[3:37:37] <dukenux> LUL
[3:37:37] <RAPHCOM> @solidus_113 oh snap
[3:37:39] <%The_Timo> @MassConnect He was using controller and his aim was ridiculous, that's why he went to the set up he's using now
[3:37:46] <+IncredibleMeh> Maybe try an Azeron?
[3:37:54] <+CakeVulture> Logitech m570 trackball mouse is perfect for pc games on the couch
[3:38:01] <ReyThePCPlayer> i just sit with my legs crossed and put the keyboard on my thighs
[3:38:05] <%ozzrabbit> Maybe you could map a power glove to IR and do it like that?
[3:38:07] <@Solidus_113> Now's the time in the game where you really need good aim too
[3:38:11] <WackyModder84> @CakeVulture, Nah, bro. The Steam Controller is the Master Race for PC Gaming on the Couch.
[3:38:12] <+BNPhone> you can use a weird double controller hybrid with two sticks Kappa
[3:38:20] <Melchior_the_Wise> Lol, azeron is like $500
[3:38:27] <derap41> There are hand held track balls
[3:38:27] <theKingRamses> there was some crazy looking controller i remember seeing awhile ago that i think was made for pc/fps stuff
[3:38:33] <%generalve> woolie make sure your posture is good otherwise your gonna fuck up your lumbar area
[3:38:34] <SlappyMeats> Powerglove. Problem solved.
[3:38:42] <unit24> trackball mice feel like ass to aim anyway
[3:38:44] <+Ches_Neckbeard> Woolie I'm just saying put that mouse on Reggies thigh and be good friends
[3:38:44] <Fenlig> Yeah if your gonna use a mouse you really need a computer table
[3:38:47] <Nekros4442> It feels like you just need an elevated board or table for your couch.
[3:38:48] <ReyThePCPlayer> i also have the mouse on a book and a bunch of pillows
[3:38:50] <unit24> I speak as somebody who needs one every day
[3:38:52] <rubbishbinge> You can rest the mouse on Reggie
[3:38:52] <+Superbro64> time to be ambidextrous Kappa
[3:38:54] <mMayrro> put it on reggie's shoulder Kappa
[3:38:54] <zk_nails> become one with the cube, Woolie
[3:39:02] <+Flambage> @WoolieVersus Those little bed lap tables that don't take up much space
[3:39:03] <+Markmeltzer> Do you have a desk you can play at and have Reggie sit next to you?
[3:39:06] <NevikGamina> LUL
[3:39:06] <%RioGascar> Im curious to see how woolie responds to vr controllers when he does do the vr
[3:39:07] <WackyModder84> The Steam Controller is the CLOSEST YOU'RE GONNA GET to keeping up with Keyboard & Mouse Responsiveness on the couch. It's got a learning curve to it, but once you configure it properly for each game, it is amazing.
[3:39:07] <Nekros4442> It fucking works Woolie
[3:39:08] <+TheFabledAble> @WoolieVersus so I actually experience weird joint/shoulder pain when I use a control;ler for a significant amount of time. Since I got Nioh 2 Ive started getting that pain again even when I take days off from playing and using a controller
[3:39:08] <+TECHNO_OUTLAW> gamer cube
[3:39:09] <+doc_ock_rokc> BECOME CUBE
[3:39:10] <Dr_Mooose> cube cube cube
[3:39:10] <Nekros4442> IT WORKS
[3:39:10] <dukenux> yeah, id just go for the simplest solution and use: a box
[3:39:11] <Spydurman> @WoolieVersus ever look into a sideways mouse? My coworker uses one to prevent his hand from hurting
[3:39:11] <+FrostedZaibatsu> Whats wrong with using a controller. If your aim is bad just move your characters instead of aiming all the way
[3:39:13] <derap41> You can call it a gamer box if trhat makes you happy
[3:39:15] <%GeneralSCPatton> Cheer500 For some context, the Half Life 1 tutorial, which isn't in the remake, is the Black Mesa Hazard Course, an obstacle course and firing range. The tram ride even has an announcement for the Hazard Course DECATHLON. I can't find a source, but I thought Gordon had some record times on that thing. He's a Chad among nerds.
[3:39:18] <@Solidus_113> It's inescapable
[3:39:18] <+jiggy_snipe> '
[3:39:21] <+Sleix_> steam controller is fine for couch aiming, but you need to invest time in configuring controller settings per-game
