[0:00:03] <%ken_kuma> AAhhh shit
[0:00:06] <dds333a> One thing i have noticed is that all the excellent aesthetic qualities of P5 make it a slog on repeat playthroughs. blew me away how much faster  I go through FES

[0:00:46] <leith_aziz> @andre11dr I mean, the setting's not the appeal to me. The writing alone does all the heavy lifting, but Im aware some people are turned off because of teh setting alone. Look at Simmons from YOVG

[0:03:30] <miucsa51> but why play good games when you can play this
[0:03:32] <+kewlmyc> It's not Woolie
[0:03:38] <andre11dr> You gotta play bad games sometimes
[0:03:44] <dds333a> and BCV LUL
[0:03:46] <andre11dr> It's very entertaining
[0:03:46] <%Prevot> LUL
[0:03:48] <DaKnightWarrior> Woolie is like the only guy who would stream Dark Edge LUL
[0:03:49] <+vaderxyz1970> Woolie died for our fighting game sins

[0:03:51] <metabot64> !UPTIME
[0:03:52] <@Moobot> @metabot64 WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 15 minutes and 12 seconds
[0:03:53] <%ken_kuma> Embrace the trash
[0:03:59] <Th3rd3> into the Woolie Hole
[0:04:03] <RickyRelucent> deep into the wooliehole
[0:04:06] <miucsa51> Some one has to carey that weight
[0:04:07] <leith_aziz> There was that racing fighting game, which was dope
[0:04:12] <+kewlmyc> It's not WoolieVs if they're not sacrificing views for looking at some niche or dank shit.
[0:04:16] <leith_aziz> So Im all for experimentation
[0:04:17] <dds333a> it can be fun, certainly
[0:04:22] <RickyRelucent> MAHVEL BABY
[0:04:29] <Speckster42> dark edge?
[0:04:31] <andre11dr> No one is tipping in Tattoo Assassins
[0:04:37] <%Dakuu75> Edge~
[0:04:46] <andre11dr> Nobody knows that even exist
[0:04:47] <dds333a> too much. we'll never finish it LUL
[0:04:56] <leith_aziz> We gonna talk about the EVO news? Curious
[0:05:11] <Arqartur0> I mean... Saltybet is on
[0:05:16] <andre11dr> What happened with EVO?
[0:05:16] <Shad0wTag> I'm sure they know
[0:05:18] <dds333a> Music to my ears
[0:05:24] <andre11dr> Did it catch fire
[0:05:32] <Shad0wTag> Pokimane's new company is partnered up with them
[0:05:39] <%Dakuu75> dooddoom
[0:05:54] <+kewlmyc> @andre11dr No, Pokimane is now part owner, which has upset some folk for reasons, i guess
[0:05:56] <Arqartur0> the Berserker Barrage spam
[0:06:00] <leith_aziz> Not MVC, but Sol Dustloops always feel great to loop
[0:06:05] <%Dakuu75> becomes a rhythm game
[0:06:06] <andre11dr> Pokimane has a company?
[0:06:09] <andre11dr> What
[0:06:10] <dds333a> HUH
[0:06:17] <+R0kushi> if nobody got me, I know pokimane got me
[0:06:18] <dds333a> A A A A A
[0:06:19] <RickyRelucent> Just ppl upset becauseof the leafy drama
[0:06:26] <+DeaconBluesClues> CvS2 bison painting the fence. @WoolieVersus
[0:06:37] <RickyRelucent> basically a dude who beefed with oki, made about 8 videos with her in the title
[0:06:51] <RickyRelucent> about 3 about the actual drama
[0:06:57] <Shad0wTag> @andre11dr Yeah its new
[0:07:05] <Bennett_Fracture> hey chat... can you tell me what is dark edge... please...
[0:07:07] <leith_aziz> Sol Sidewinder KINDA give me that feeling, but I completely suck at doing them, so for me I cant get that feeling
[0:07:09] <Bennett_Fracture> thank you...
[0:07:13] <RickyRelucent> he got banned for it because his channel had old ass content that was REALLY off kilter
[0:07:16] <miucsa51> leafy still a thing?
[0:07:17] <dds333a> exactly
[0:07:18] <RickyRelucent> after poki
[0:07:23] <andre11dr> Pokimane owning EVO is pretty funny, ngl
[0:07:38] <%ken_kuma> SF5 Ken super is great.
[0:07:51] <Shad0wTag> @andre11dr She doesn't own EVO just her company can work alongside them
[0:07:54] <dds333a> It's like Kim switching the kick after the Houo Kyaku
[0:07:59] <%Prevot> super edging
[0:08:19] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @zepherl
[0:08:24] <leith_aziz> I dont wanna drag the conversation for long, but who exactly is Pokimane? Like people talk about her like she's a terrible person. Does she profit from people simping for her or something?
[0:08:26] <andre11dr> @shad0wtag Oh ,well that's less crazy than i thought
[0:08:27] <Bennett_Fracture> no impact at the end...
[0:08:33] <Bennett_Fracture> its so lackluster...
[0:08:34] <%Dakuu75> Dan's taunt super, lives rent free in my head
[0:08:42] <RickyRelucent> Poki is just a twitch personality
[0:08:43] <DaKnightWarrior> Legit perfect.
[0:08:44] <dds333a> 1234
[0:08:48] <RickyRelucent> a brand like ninja, max
[0:08:54] <RickyRelucent> up there with the greats, for some
[0:09:06] <andre11dr> @leith_aziz Isn't that all content creators tho?
[0:09:11] <RickyRelucent> only twitchthot i watch is paige
[0:09:14] <+zepherl> All hail our new queen Poki!!!! The savior of MVC2!!!!
[0:09:15] <RickyRelucent> all hail the mustard queen.
[0:09:21] <andre11dr> Don't act like you don't simp for Woolie
[0:09:26] <%Dakuu75> @RickyRelucent damn, that's real. lol
[0:09:26] <Shad0wTag> @andre11dr she also tweeted #freemvc2 as well
[0:09:48] <RickyRelucent> ehh i have a type
[0:09:49] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:09:51] <RickyRelucent> sue me
[0:09:53] <andre11dr> Where all Woolie simps
[0:10:08] <%ChoculaUltra> I only simp for vtubers and Vs gang FeelsGoodMan
[0:10:12] <%Dakuu75> the Physics of theoretical combos. lol
[0:10:23] <+kewlmyc> Woolie simps have VERY specific tastes
[0:10:33] <+DeaconBluesClues> @WoolieVersus the term is "talent"
[0:10:35] <%ChoculaUltra> speaking of which - wasn't Reggie getting his pc ready for solo streams and what not what happened to that
[0:10:36] <leith_aziz> I watch Shenpai, but that's more because she's funny and has a fun personality while playing Yakuza games. She also intreoduced me to crystaahhl who streamed TWEWY
[0:11:02] <%CaptainPileDriver> she-hulk used to be top tier in vanilla 3
[0:11:03] <dds333a> FIGHT'S OVER
[0:11:24] <%ChoculaUltra> I just want Nero and Miles Morales in the next MvC, the rest of the roster could be complete randos and I wouldn't care LUL
[0:11:25] <leith_aziz> I also watch Calli and Gura because teh former's a Guilty Gear fan and the latter's pretty funny and became a DMC fan. That's about it when it coems to V-tubers
[0:11:26] <andre11dr> But then Vergil came out
[0:11:33] <%CaptainPileDriver> shuma-gorath is good
[0:11:38] <leith_aziz> Anywaayyy...moving on
[0:11:40] <andre11dr> And he was broken
[0:11:46] <%Dakuu75> the most danty of mashes~ with your pinky extended~
[0:11:47] <dds333a> My little bro put work into x-23 LUL
[0:11:49] <%DashXero> Micromash combos.
[0:11:57] <andre11dr> And he was easy to play
[0:12:12] <%CaptainPileDriver> and firebrand is legit great for that unblockable setup that he has for free
[0:12:23] <dds333a> @choculaultra the irony LUL
[0:12:27] <leith_aziz> There's Jill in MVC3 who plays super differently and no one's tried figuring her out because easier, stronger characters exist
[0:12:39] <andre11dr> Vergil is so dumb in Marvel 3 ,it makes me feel dirty when i play him
[0:12:50] <andre11dr> Why are his normals like that
[0:12:54] <%slayabee> slayabee subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! 10 months on the 10th month
[0:12:55] <%Dakuu75> they came out the hyperballic time chamber with an arcade stick in hand
[0:13:13] <%ken_kuma> Strive was like the first game I actually felt good at.
[0:13:17] <leith_aziz> @andre11dr Vergil's destined to be broken in any game he's in. Don't feel shame for experiencing POWER pickySmug
[0:13:19] <%ChoculaUltra> its weird cuz I have no problem with Vergil players, but vanilla Phoenix/Jean players need to be put on a list for public safet
[0:13:35] <%ken_kuma> I love fighting games, but something awoke in me that allowed me to play other games after Strive.
[0:13:54] <RickyRelucent> I don't play mvc but i'd love to make a tema with firebrand, dormammu and dante/vergil
[0:13:57] <dds333a> study up
[0:14:00] <leith_aziz> Xrd Rev 2 was the first Fighting game I felt legit "good" at after hours of playing. Which made smooth sailing for Strive and now im having the time of my life with this series
[0:14:00] <%ChoculaUltra> thats what a good fighting game does! open the doors to others @ken_kuma
[0:14:08] <RickyRelucent> just never quite got there
[0:14:15] <andre11dr> I haven't touched Strive much lately, haven't touched FGs in general
[0:14:15] <BlurringM> facts
[0:14:19] <%ken_kuma> @ChoculaUltra And it feels so fucking good!
[0:14:44] <leith_aziz> @andre11dr That's fine. You can find a tiem for it when soemthing new comes uo. Maybe wait for the next DLC
[0:15:00] <dds333a> @ken_kuma that was the kof effect for many back then
[0:15:07] <%DashXero> What's the reward for that?
[0:15:29] <dds333a> LUL LUL
[0:15:37] <%townzzzzz> townzzzzz subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! time to enjoy some fighting
[0:15:42] <andre11dr> And then Samsho came to.an end
[0:15:46] <dds333a> couldn't be Kappa
[0:15:52] <%ChoculaUltra> as much as love to mock the Smash community, I have immense respect for legit Melee players. That game is FAST AF BOIII
[0:16:15] <+kewlmyc> Ye of little faith
[0:16:19] <leith_aziz> @ChoculaUltra Unless you're Leffen who im always having a hard time deciding how to feeel about him.
[0:16:31] <dds333a> especially the ded
[0:16:45] <%ChoculaUltra> @leith_aziz omg I'm the same way - dude is almost TOO good at being a "heel" in the fgc.
[0:17:06] <%ChoculaUltra> I can never tell if he's being a legit asshole or just shitposting LUL

[0:17:20] <andre11dr> We all know Smash is for babies that can't handle actually fighting games-Spirit of Pat
[0:17:22] <%ken_kuma> @leith_aziz I was actually just watching his Guilty Gear stream and I feel the same way

[0:17:39] <leith_aziz> @ChoculaUltra I think I'd rather just say he's an ass, but I dont hold grudges. I feel like he's still running into teh same issues which make people hate him
[0:17:40] <%AlteisenReiseZ> and MICRODASHES
[0:17:55] <dds333a> @q
[0:18:04] <%ChoculaUltra> @Shad0wTag fchamp walked so these kids could run FeelsBadMan
[0:18:06] <dds333a> @alteisenreisez Kreygasm
[0:18:12] <leith_aziz> Chipp got nerfed? Im dropping him and gonna try out the next top tier. Nevermind the fact that he's still good
[0:18:19] <Arqartur0> So... Woolie... You did not cross the line!?
[0:18:26] <andre11dr> @leith_aziz I feel like he's doing that cause it keeps attention
[0:18:40] <Louie_Salmon> When I see the line I quit, every time. I would rather not play than play while knowing I could be doing more damage.
[0:18:46] <andre11dr> Also it gets in peoples head when they fight him
[0:19:22] <andre11dr> Like "oh i better not lose to this asshole" and then they lose because they were nervous
[0:19:26] <leith_aziz> @andre11dr If that's the case, I hate that attitude. Being the "hot take" guy. like holy shit, stick to what you feel and not worry about viewership
[0:19:27] <dds333a> exactly
[0:19:42] <%ken_kuma> For sure
[0:19:53] <dds333a> I was about to say, if you start young, things come
[0:20:15] <leith_aziz> I think that's how Guilty Gear became my fav fighting game. Probably helped in teh process of making me a lorehead who loves it
[0:20:32] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> Started fighting games when I was jobless/not in school, I had too much time to play, now I only got 1 day a week to practice/play lmfao
[0:20:43] <%ken_kuma> Yo, Reggie lemme take a crack at you with Falco!
[0:20:45] <andre11dr> @leith_aziz I mean when i went to Kickboxing class ,they literally taught you about shit talking and how to make the opponent nervous with words
[0:20:48] <dds333a> can't get too cold LUL
[0:20:53] <leith_aziz> It also gave me enough time to experience different FG communities like NRS and Tekken, and yeah I wasnt having fun
[0:21:03] <andre11dr> The thing Leffen is doing has a long history
[0:21:06] <Arqartur0> this happened with me with Magic the gathering
[0:21:14] <dds333a> @andre11dr exactly, the mental aspect is potentially overpowering
[0:21:21] <SlangPunk> Is dark edge like the dark arts?
[0:21:23] <%CaptainPileDriver> menat can BURN IN HELL
[0:21:42] <ExpressNode> Oh hey it's edgy Reggie and Unruly Woolie my favorite characters
[0:21:48] <%ken_kuma> @andre11dr mental games are so important
[0:21:51] <%ChoculaUltra> then you have guys like LowTierGod who you can't take seriously when they try to play up the whole Heel bit LUL
[0:21:56] <dds333a> @arqartur0 when did you quit, for me it was decades ago LUL
[0:22:11] <dds333a> no more FNM for me
[0:22:46] <Arqartur0> @dds333a also a few years ago, before 2020, now I just stick to arena
[0:22:57] <%ken_kuma> @ChoculaUltra Despite what people say about LTG, he is so goddamn quick at improv it's amazing
[0:23:04] <andre11dr> and it's 50/50
[0:23:13] <%ChoculaUltra> @ken_kuma oh for sure - he's super good as an entertainer/streamer in that regard
[0:23:43] <%DashXero> The game always evolves.
[0:23:50] <%ken_kuma> LTG is the only person to make me laugh at what are essentially Yo Mama jokes.
[0:23:50] <dds333a> @arqartur0 stands to reason, I used to fiend for standard circuits, but i got too far out of the game due to life, and I spent a lot on it, so that was it
[0:24:16] <andre11dr> This reminds me of that perfect OS tokido found ,where if you back dash the uppercut won't come out, but if you don't it dose
[0:24:17] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1452876605185998851?t=s4kcX_jYto2dS6pItMmhRg&s=19
[0:24:23] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> FEAR
[0:24:24] <andre11dr> Or something like that
[0:24:40] <Arqartur0> @dds333a me too; college happened, and then I started saving for a camera and yeah, mtg actually helped me to get it XD
[0:24:50] <Demoli_PT> more evidence blanka players dont deserve rights
[0:25:33] <andre11dr> Blanka has this problem, his always trash or god tier
[0:26:02] <dds333a> doesn't seem feasible, huh?
[0:26:10] <leith_aziz> Y'know, I don't know if LTG's acting most of the time, but I cant say I enjoy watching someone be an asshole even if its for the sake of laughing at him. It's like watching DSP. Instead of laughing at him, he'd probably piss me off more than anything with his takes
[0:26:33] <andre11dr> Oh LTG is definitely mot acting
[0:26:41] <andre11dr> It's been to long
[0:26:48] <@Solidus_113> LUL

[0:27:28] <GeltonZ> YEAH! Time for Galaxy Fight meets Ballz 3D!
[0:27:29] <andre11dr> @dds333a I'm just saying, he must be acting for 8 years with no slips
[0:27:33] <DSD24> I think they talked about Dolores last stream
[0:27:35] <Shad0wTag> LTG's acting? Oh please that man can't help himself
[0:27:38] <dds333a> @tigerclaws12 briefly, last stream
[0:27:40] <BlurringM> metriod dread is good
[0:27:45] <TigerClaws12> @DSD24 @dds333a thanks
[0:27:50] <leith_aziz> Glad to see you Nintendo guys winning for once. Company itself excluded

[1:53:58] <DSD24> This music is pretty good
[1:54:00] <abbock> inputs are different because they picked "normal" instead of "arcade"
[1:54:00] <GeltonZ> The armadillo looks like a croissant.
[1:54:05] <kinkade_77> Tf is he supposed to be
[1:54:16] <+KaosMachina> you need to select dog special
[1:54:18] <+KaosMachina> or not
[1:54:21] <abbock> normal is somewhat simplified inputs because so many people would play on phone touch screen

[1:56:25] <hamahiroyuki> is this running on flash?
[1:56:31] <leith_aziz> @Taisuru It depends on the game, but in some games i find it cool
[1:56:33] <dds333a> but the final boss tho
[1:56:51] <%andrewofbob> Could it be to sell the unlocks? Ouya has a f2p requirement
[1:56:52] <DSD24> Nice car
[1:57:05] <leith_aziz> "Choose Low"?
[1:57:10] <DSD24> Yo this music is bumping

[1:58:04] <%Vigonept> it happens! check out some pics of the natives in guatemala going to a legal battle
[1:58:05] <%ken_kuma> Was that a roman cancel?
[1:58:08] <%Charronia> I mean, the Ottoman empire hasn't existed for like a century limesThink
[1:58:17] <abbock> there's no double jump. you can kara your jump
[1:58:23] <andre11dr> Ok but for real, was this made in Flash? LUL
[1:58:33] <dds333a> look at that

[1:59:07] <stranger59> Do you get a rage meter?
[1:59:15] <BackflipCharm> I feel like there's some systems at play here that we don't know about
[1:59:39] <+jacintafor> I think the recovery thing is like 1 more from persona
[1:59:41] <abbock> i think this is the version of slashers with chaos drives, which got added after i stopped playing
[1:59:54] <+SuperFightinRobot> If you die tonight HEAVEN or HELL
[1:59:56] <andre11dr> Also they have a Smasho 6 thing going on, with the 2d caracters and the terrible 3d effects LUL
[2:00:01] <+SuperFightinRobot> Tell em the cows sent ya

[2:00:33] <andre11dr> She didn't die tho
[2:00:42] <abbock> the creator of the game is turkish yes
[2:00:43] <stranger59> If the SamSho blood spray happened, I would not have been surprised.
[2:00:46] <dds333a> @ken_kuma definitely
[2:00:53] <andre11dr> Look at the names and i will tell
[2:01:04] <@Solidus_113> Abbock seems to know about this game for some reason
[2:01:11] <andre11dr> Like the designer names
[2:01:19] <dds333a> Brandon, let's go
[2:01:28] <abbock> @Solidus_113 i was one of the, like, 7 active players of Slashers in 2016 ish

[2:01:50] <abbock> i miss when Andre's taunt was actually good
[2:01:55] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> believe it
[2:01:59] <dds333a> this is the only track that grabs me so far
[2:02:00] <+tempestzephyr> this is very "how to draw manga"
[2:02:05] <%andrewofbob> Go on Youtube and look for MSPaint timelapses
[2:02:05] <stranger59> MSPaint is the REAL way to draw sprites
[2:02:07] <+jacintafor> Brandon gets realy pixelated when he jumps
[2:02:10] <DSD24> With a bit of Rob Leifield
[2:02:18] <dds333a> combos
[2:02:20] <@Solidus_113> Brandon's backdash, kick and grab are still the GBA sprites LUL
[2:02:27] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @razielhex
[2:02:39] <$razielhex> Stun Games, who developed this, is indeed from Istanbul
[2:02:42] <andre11dr> Bradom is like if i made a 5 year old draw Jago LUL
[2:02:46] <miucsa51> This game looks like one of those action show made in flash during the mid 00's
[2:02:47] <dds333a> What
[2:03:01] <dds333a> YO THE ARMADILLO
[2:03:02] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:03:04] <stranger59> I like that Brandon still hasn't fully escaped the GBA dimension.
[2:03:06] <%Deft_Thought> These Rob Liefield chests are somethin special
[2:03:13] <+Proxzo> that's just MvC wolverine
[2:03:19] <DSD24> Hey Brandon what's your favorite Guardian of the Galaxy? "ROCKET"
[2:03:34] <dds333a> THAT HURT LUL
[2:03:35] <+aBoner89> 4Head Rocket

[2:03:49] <dds333a> LUL
[2:04:13] <andre11dr> This more on the flash game side

[2:04:42] <hamahiroyuki> look at that neon green ass sword strap
[2:04:42] <abbock> i reaaaaally hope they look at the combo trials
[2:04:58] <dds333a> LET THE BLODDSHED BEGIN AGAIN
[2:05:02] <+SuperFightinRobot> I like that they are locked but you can still clearly see their portraits on the select screen
[2:05:05] <@Solidus_113> we're still not on the main game of the trilogy LUL
[2:05:22] <+polothegreatest> natan explosion casting
[2:05:30] <dds333a> C-Shin LUL

[2:16:18] <%townzzzzz> why QA your game when you can get the players to do it
[2:16:28] <dds333a> this can happen even with non-jank games

[2:39:40] <waltzqueen> SLASH

[2:40:00] <Murdercles> it looks like TRASH to me
[2:40:14] <waltzqueen> this game looks like an off brand comic book and i loe it
[2:40:18] <HotSauceFiend> I just arrived. I can't tell if this is supposed to be a good fighting game or a janky fighting game
[2:40:31] <Hoarseplay> @HotSauceFiend Yes to both.
[2:40:37] <dds333a> @hotsaucefiend the latter, definitely LUL
[2:40:43] <DSD24> Gun Fingers lets go
[2:40:47] <andre11dr> @hotsaucefiend It's kinda both
[2:40:52] <dds333a> but it has hype, and is the best of the three, I'd say
[2:41:00] <andre11dr> But more jank than good
[2:41:05] <+pupil31> PogChamp
[2:41:07] <dds333a> purely from what I've seen, at least
[2:41:13] <abbock> if woolie finds out how to switch stance as alperen, his opinion will totally turn around
[2:41:22] <Hoarseplay> Top level paly of this game is mad hype.

[2:41:46] <Louie_Salmon> That's a really interesting move
