[0:51:00] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> andd then he got pneumonia and died

[0:53:57] <armchairmaster_> @woolieversus we could do some side quests until Minh comes back, in case he wants to see you FINISH THE FIGHT in person.
[0:54:18] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> is mongol armour an option?
[0:54:22] <misterurbanthelegend> ・・・

[0:55:59] <+jiggy_snipe> well it's Japanese technically
[0:56:01] <armchairmaster_> Jin wants that new fit
[0:56:02] <+askalta> it was forged by japanese smith
[0:56:03] <$jake5713> Armor is armor.
[0:56:08] <sendart> its not technically mongol armor
[0:56:11] <+Arkfyre> No way, it's the ultimate ghost tech. Just walk right in unnoticed
[0:56:17] <+TheNeonGraveyard> It's 100% sneak tech
[0:56:32] <$jake5713> By any means necessary.
[0:57:02] <@SoushinSen> Honestly, i straight up tried to get the armor ASAP so i can wear it in front of Uncle Shimura.

[1:04:51] <pjbuster> @SaltkeyAndAckfish I wouldn't say that, the game gives you a lot of tools by this time
[1:05:08] <%fatigued_driving> Straight up usurped
[1:05:10] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> so then it's just easy?
[1:05:10] <+TheNeonGraveyard> "Are you sure The Ghost isn't really multiple people?" "IT WAS ONE GUY"
[1:05:17] <+EchoXOF> Shin Wilhelm
[1:05:37] <%doomerskeletor13> I mean you can get pretty fucked up quickly if you’re not playing well
[1:05:37] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> idk that healthbar seems a little more than tools
[1:06:03] <kenny_biff> auto parry happens when you're in the middle of an attack... I think
[1:06:11] <+thackattack00> that's correct
[1:06:36] <tonfirean> Yeah, the game isn't that hard on normal. I'm no leet gamer boy and I don't usually play this kind of game, but I got through it without much frustration.
[1:06:37] <Make_me_mad> @SaltkeyAndAckfish The game gets a lot easier as you go on, yes. The start of the game is pretty lethal where one mistake can kill you, and by the end you're nearly unstoppable. The enemies level up with you, but not nearly as much.

[1:07:52] <%Mr_Strut> There's one
[1:07:54] <pjbuster> yea
[1:07:55] <+chiazam> Why does he never roll from a fall lmao
[1:08:06] <%doomerskeletor13> He played it for a bit but eventually abandoned it
[1:08:07] <HarmlessCrow> Pup snuffer :(
[1:08:07] <huskarl_zap> They're weapons of war
[1:08:09] <+thackattack00> yeah he played sekiro, never finished it tho
[1:08:10] <+babyacid> dont make me kill the doggos game
[1:08:10] <+TheNeonGraveyard> We don't talk about Sekiro
[1:08:16] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> i was gonna ask, how'd that go
[1:08:16] <tonfirean> There is some ebb and flow in that if you run out of "get out of jail free" cards like kunai and smoke bombs it gets harder. But it's pretty rare to run out.
[1:08:17] <huskarl_zap> as are war horses
[1:08:23] <%Mr_Strut> At least your not getting dumb flashbacks about their life with their owner
[1:08:23] <Make_me_mad> No one should have played Sekiro.
[1:08:27] <huskarl_zap> but killing people tho

[1:09:33] <therakishsage> Just shoot center mass.
[1:09:54] <+chiazam> The short bow can't pierce helmets, that's what the long bow is for
[1:09:55] <+askalta> longbow to the chest when they have iron helms
[1:10:01] <+askalta> oh
[1:10:04] <Pappajimbo> thats why its a bonus
[1:10:08] <+TheNeonGraveyard> you already have all the techniques maxed out right?
[1:10:12] <+Arkfyre> it's silly that a helet is doing what it's designed to do?
[1:10:25] <+chiazam> There were enemies that didn't have helmets
[1:10:25] <kenny_biff> you can still take out most helmetted enemies with a short bow, as long as you hit them in the face
[1:10:40] <tonfirean> Archers are weak, do those die in one from the shortbow?
[1:10:51] <Make_me_mad> Not everything needs to be a one shot kill.
[1:10:52] <sologarza> Aim at the face, that works with short bow
[1:11:14] <%JetpackMcQuack> I would expect a flinch but it is what it is

[1:53:48] <Equirah> @Make_me_mad par for the course with every historic game
[1:53:49] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Baller you say?
[1:53:51] <%bread_assassin> Nier Automata's was like 30hrs in.
[1:53:57] <T_Sasquatch> Nier automata has like 5 title drops LUL
[1:53:57] <pjbuster> yooo nier automata had me hyped
[1:53:58] <%doomerskeletor13> Fargo Season 4 just did a 20 minute intro before their title drop
[1:54:02] <Make_me_mad> @doomerskeletor13 I didn't say that it was. I just find it funny that the game is a valiant fight against the invading army when historically the island just got rocked.
[1:54:10] <@Menitta> Automata had a fucking sequel trailer drop
[1:54:11] <+TheNeonGraveyard> khublai khan was at Tsushima, khotun died 6 years before the invasion
[1:54:13] <@Menitta> Mid game
[1:54:15] <@Menitta> it's sick
[1:54:19] <yusefHD> Mummy was flawless
[1:54:25] <$BallerSwagBro9k> What about when the title drops just before the credits? @woolieversus
[1:54:30] <@Menitta> Oh fuck I gotta see Perdition
[1:54:33] <misterurbanthelegend> Nolan Trilogy
[1:54:50] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Avatar did that
[1:54:57] <%Lion_kun> Nier Automata. Title drop after beating the game twice.
[1:55:06] <huskarl_zap> there was am omception two?
[1:55:10] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> THE LION KING
[1:55:21] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> chills

[1:55:31] <%doomerskeletor13> @huskarl_zap He’s saying Inception, too
[1:55:38] <@Menitta> I hate that it took a pandemic for me to play that game
[1:55:39] <pjbuster> legitimately great
[1:55:47] <%Javaa01> """"Replays""""
[1:55:51] <%emperordread> Neir automata to me sounds like someone saying "Near a tomato" and it will never be the same
[1:55:54] <+Arkfyre> It's not really replays
[1:55:58] <$BallerSwagBro9k> I love Automata but it makes me depressed AF
[1:55:59] <huskarl_zap> @doomerskeletor13 ahh okay
[1:56:02] <@Menitta> You replay it technically once
[1:56:07] <pjbuster> it's from different perspectives
[1:56:08] <%Exiliator> Its like fake replays
[1:56:15] <@Menitta> then its a sequel
[1:56:18] <@Menitta> ye
[1:56:20] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> You only loop once
[1:56:38] <@Menitta> Nier Automata doesn't start until Mission 5C
[1:56:54] <pjbuster> the first loop was just the prolounge

[2:40:05] <+jiggy_snipe> every point is just misery
[2:40:13] <%RyTYoung> He mustve flew off the cliff Kappa
[2:40:21] <Make_me_mad> No shuffled footprings at the cliffside, though. The flipped right out of his shoes.
[2:40:34] <yusefHD> at least the charm was it for swim speed up
[2:40:40] <%Livelinne> woolieMIRIN
[2:40:56] <+jiggy_snipe> good session
[2:41:00] <jorniev> did he already do norio?
[2:41:05] <+jiggy_snipe> yep
[2:41:11] <%doomerskeletor13> Good sesh gebts
[2:41:14] <%doomerskeletor13> Gents
[2:41:17] <%Livelinne> !motivated
[2:41:17] <@Moobot> 1724 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[2:41:20] <+jiggy_snipe> he unlocked Norio's DT
[2:41:34] <%Livelinne> !uptime
[2:41:34] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 2 minutes
[2:41:36] <%doomerskeletor13> You could def finish the game on Thursday I think
[2:41:52] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @woolieversus will you be doing a GIFG for KOF 2002 UM for the rollback beta?
[2:42:25] <%Livelinne> Oh hey new figures in background. Bye Levi
[2:43:16] <%Javaa01> Yeah I don't believe in 60% wired
[2:43:35] <+jiggy_snipe> It's possible if the PC crowd is huge
[2:43:52] <+Arkfyre> NA console players LUL
[2:44:02] <%Javaa01> The PC crowd is meaningful, but it's still far from being a majority platform
[2:44:07] <CrimsonGargoyle> who woulda seen that coming Kappa
[2:44:25] <armchairmaster_> Wait, how far did they get since i've been gone?
[2:44:39] <armchairmaster_> Last thing I saw was norio activating ghost stance
[2:44:51] <+jiggy_snipe> it doesn't seem it has a sufficient frame buffer or any prediction so there's no point
[2:45:24] <+jiggy_snipe> 99.9 wifi on switch Kappa
[2:45:51] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Why does Nintendo do half the things they do?
[2:46:06] <DatAsuna> Nintendo are very penny pincher about that kinda stuff
[2:46:18] <DatAsuna> Remember with new 3DS they did't even include a fucking charger??
[2:46:22] <pjbuster> general question but is wired play always better than wifi play?
[2:46:26] <+jiggy_snipe> very late to the party on anything
[2:46:40] <armchairmaster_> @pjbuster yes, 100% of the time
[2:46:41] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:46:57] <DatAsuna> IN this case it's not even nintendo being late tho, just cheap
[2:47:13] <+jiggy_snipe> @pjbuster always better but won't save crap interest
[2:47:17] <%Reverend_Roscoe> GIFG?
[2:47:19] <+jiggy_snipe> internet*
[2:47:23] <+desfore> Unless you have like, a fucked up cable or something; Wired will be more reliable than WiFi
[2:47:43] <%Reverend_Roscoe> YEYEYE
[2:47:50] <@Menitta> Ever since that announcement I started practicing
[2:47:50] <+joyfuload> fighting game AI improvement would be nice, but don't waste resources on it
