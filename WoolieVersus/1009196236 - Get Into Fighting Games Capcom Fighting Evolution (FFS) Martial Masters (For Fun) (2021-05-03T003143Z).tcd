[0:08:02] <%patriotrenegade> I expect nothing.
[0:08:13] <PMda2nd> all we are is dust in the wind - Smash online
[0:08:13] <%patriotrenegade> And yet, I am still disappointed
[0:08:28] <TigerClaws12> Koreans aren't dumping their PCs

[0:09:54] <Applecannon63> MK is gonna be rough
[0:10:22] <MrBaconJam> The only way for them to get better is to give them a SEGA-tier humbling. Basically, go 3rd party.

[0:21:03] <pixel_river> i want marvel gameplay with capcom pnly
[0:21:05] <+Pugweight> oh man id die for that
[0:21:07] <+emeraldsplasher> ARIKA was developing this btw
[0:21:09] <+Ultimate_Edge> A great idea that they can't seem to execute right for whatever reason
[0:21:10] <%ChoculaUltra> there were probably dramatic breaks with lore characters. At least I hope there were
[0:21:10] <Applecannon63> its looks a like a glorified pause?
[0:21:15] <%KetsuoTaberu> Take that!
[0:21:16] <Hessman212> SFV has sort become that
[0:21:20] <Adwark> Forced reset back to neutral with bit of flair.
[0:21:35] <+b_aleph> SEGA!!!
[0:21:47] <%kewlmyc> Eh, I'd say 3rd best at this point
[0:21:48] <fIashman92> Sega and Square Enix
[0:21:48] <+mechatengu21> atpJuntao
[0:21:48] <%ChoculaUltra> Capcom fatalities monkaS

[0:21:58] <+thedream_c> oh wait
[0:21:59] <brexdq> jump Force but a 2d fighter would be cool
[0:22:05] <Applecannon63> the problem because Ono issues of prioritizing the budget
[0:22:06] <%ChoculaUltra> Dramatic Mortal Fatal Finish Kappa
[0:22:12] <+Mordexai0> @brexdq That's just Infinite Versus
[0:22:15] <deafmelone> There is a trailer

[0:23:35] <+thedream_c> but yeah Final Fight has been kneedeep in SF lore to some degree with the alpha series
[0:23:35] <+Mordexai0> This was being made by ARIKA @woolieversus
[0:23:37] <+fredan31> I used to scour The gamespot website when I first heard about this game
[0:23:39] <%ChoculaUltra> and then they took the idea and made Teppen Kappa
[0:23:41] <+thedream_c> ohhh Arika

[0:24:28] <+fredan31> I miss early 2000 Gamespot
[0:24:30] <fIashman92> Sega was able to make a crossover fighting game based off of just ONE division's IPs alone
[0:24:31] <Solidnick18> potato PogChamp
[0:24:38] <+xerotwo> O O F
[0:24:42] <%saladin1911> D.D

[0:24:52] <+thedream_c> and 3 new cummers
[0:24:52] <+mechatengu21> do we have hi-res for the art that just appeared?!
[0:24:52] <Darren716> This is so 2003 it hurts

[0:25:02] <Super_Voltekka> I really hope the prototype gets dumped one day so we can play it on MAME
[0:25:02] <%ChoculaUltra> and then Capcom said back to the pits with you LUL
[0:25:04] <Hessman212> was his name Code:Rage?
[0:25:06] <alphalejandro> In Winter...NEVER
[0:25:07] <%saladin1911> D.D. just seems like an inverted K' with electricity instead of fire lmao. I dig it
[0:25:07] <DaKnightWarrior> In arcades this never.
[0:25:08] <DrunkenDice> lock it up away in the vault
[0:25:12] <+Jiggisnipe> that's Teppen
[0:25:14] <Darren716> Teppen?
[0:25:14] <%ChoculaUltra> holy quality jump
[0:25:15] <diontmack> we have teppen Kappa
[0:25:20] <pixel_river> other fgs than SF
[0:25:22] <+thedream_c> Capcom VS 4 but actualy treat it right
[0:25:25] <$Dungeon00X> Cool with Streetwise? DarkMode
[0:25:29] <+thedream_c> yeah exactly
[0:25:35] <+thedream_c> Capcom Versus Infinite Z
[0:25:35] <Qsmash_> "Streetwise was shit" -Mikami
[0:25:49] <%LastHazzerd> Capcom Maximum Forces
[0:25:50] <+fredan31> is Capcom the worst at managing their IPs?
[0:25:51] <feralknights> I actually enjoyed CFE/CFJ but I understand the layers of it not being a good game. I was kind of starved for access to games back then.
[0:25:53] <+thedream_c> oh yeah Akira is tryign to make it to SFV
[0:25:54] <curryweek> I very much dig bomber jacket Alex
[0:25:55] <liishuwen> akira!

[0:26:10] <brexdq> make a capcom All-Star fighting and then make another Marvel Superheroes done and done
[0:26:10] <%ChoculaUltra> Leon Kennedy will never be an RE rep in a versus style game FeelsBadMan

[0:26:21] <DaKnightWarrior> That's cool.
[0:26:22] <%jinking79> bring back RUBY HEART
[0:26:29] <+thedream_c> TvC was the last time we saw a mid tier Alex
[0:26:35] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> BIG
[0:26:35] <+logoth_> BIGINNING
[0:26:36] <Darren716> LUL
[0:26:38] <+Pugweight> biginning
[0:26:38] <anarchistPastry> BIGINNING
[0:26:39] <mrpandabear437> yo that was ryus v trigger 2?!!!!!
[0:26:39] <+thedream_c> and Ryu was actually swag as fuckin TvC as well
[0:26:40] <Solidnick18> biginning
[0:26:41] <ajmgamesdev> That reminds me of Chipp from Strive
[0:26:42] <deafmelone> Ryu had a TETSUZANKO
[0:26:42] <alphalejandro> Capcom was afraid of the game receiving the reception as KOF Maximum Impact
[0:26:45] <AstrodropGaming> zyzxLmao zyzxLmao zyzxLmao
[0:26:46] <+fredan31> @mrbaconjam I mean they have the biggest IPS but at least they made Smash Brothers
[0:26:47] <Adwark> It feels kind of funny to see that this Strider thing is kinda alike to GG Strive Chipp super
[0:26:48] <Solidnick18> LUL
[0:26:50] <%X2Eliah> Honestly who needs fighting games when you have Sekiro Owl (Father) fight
[0:26:57] <+thedream_c> CANNdcelled
[0:27:02] <Applecannon63> Ryu's Final Punch
[0:27:03] <Solidnick18> classic capcpom
[0:27:04] <Darren716> I neve had a chance to bigin
[0:27:05] <+mechatengu21> the art....
[0:27:08] <iamtheTwitchghost> dat ryu
[0:27:11] <+thedream_c> WOW 16 chars so little for 2020 :p
[0:27:12] <+The_Death_Owl> I wonder if the ROM still exists somewhere
[0:27:12] <+Mordexai0> GUILTY GEAR VIBES
[0:27:13] <$Dungeon00X> Yep, that looks like Shinkiro's artwork
[0:27:14] <$emptyantics> WHY IS STRIDER SO SICK
[0:27:16] <%ChoculaUltra> surely the source code has to exist on some random dev kit lying around in some locker or something, right?!
[0:27:17] <DedlokPM> DAN?
[0:27:20] <+thedream_c> but CFN portal has them tho LMAO
[0:27:21] <DedlokPM> doodSurvive
[0:27:24] <%Mathochism> K' was also supposed to be a guest character in this.
[0:27:26] <Qsmash_> people hated it apparently
[0:27:33] <+thedream_c> CFN portal got the most obscure chars in the database
[0:27:33] <alphalejandro> Maximum Impact happen
[0:27:46] <+emeraldsplasher> K' was supposed to be a guest character @woolieversus
[0:27:47] <Mixoops> I came in looking at hype, and get told it got canceled. WHY
[0:27:55] <JayEarly> if Leon gets in a VS game he better have a suplex command grab
[0:27:55] <%ChoculaUltra> I don't blame them - Capcom and 3D fighters have been hit or miss since the EX series
[0:27:56] <+Jiggisnipe> CvS2?
[0:28:00] <deafmelone> The finishers apparently had nonsense input to do them
[0:28:00] <Applecannon63> same people that didn't appreciate New Generation
[0:28:01] <+thedream_c> the wading pool of 3d FGs
[0:28:06] <+xerotwo> INCLUDING GG ISUKA
[0:28:07] <brunoberserk> maybe because was too similar to maximum impact
[0:28:15] <BlackermanZX> yo screw those arcade people wooliePOYO

[0:29:45] <Klefth> Yoshinori "Oh no" Ono...
[0:29:51] <+fredan31> what if this got popular when it came out and people started dropping 3rd strike. We would never get Evo moment 37
[0:29:52] <+The_Death_Owl> the darkest timeline
[0:29:53] <$emptyantics> *A SOFT FART BELLOWS*
[0:29:55] <Oak_bogle> Reggie asking the good questions
[0:29:55] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/wooliewoolz/status/1372228846108483586?s=21
[0:30:03] <+thedream_c> mhw is nepotism that saved Capcom to some degree financially
[0:30:03] <Skeletonmanners> @WoolieVersus actually Ono's first game as a director was fucking CHAOS LEGION
[0:30:12] <+thedream_c> ah the forgotten Chaos Legion
[0:30:13] <+eanscrale> OH NO
[0:30:16] <+eanscrale> wow
[0:30:17] <Deko_> we got infinite versus
[0:30:19] <Darren716> We got that Morrigan sprite
[0:30:19] <curryweek> What was the budget for CFJ though? It must've been really really cheap
[0:30:19] <@Moobot> That's a tad too many emotes, @oni_exe (warning)
[0:30:20] <+FuqBoiSlim> CHAOS WHO?
[0:30:20] <cj_art> yeah!!! reuse those assets!!!
[0:30:21] <Applecannon63> how is Chaos Legion?
[0:30:23] <Solidnick18> we done
[0:30:26] <+thedream_c> Darkstalkers is not dead... in 2011
[0:30:27] <Solidnick18> lol
[0:30:27] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Super_Voltekka
[0:30:32] <brunoberserk> JUST FUCK IT ! DO A MUGEN !!
[0:30:36] <BlackermanZX> worse mugen really
[0:30:37] <+BuckizcoBeet> It does sound like a MUGEN project.
[0:30:38] <alphalejandro> We got instead a worse MVC2
[0:30:39] <DingusMcBaseball> dont talk shit about mugen tho
[0:30:40] <Klefth> @thedream_c TBF, Ryozo has been doing a great job with MH
[0:30:42] <deafmelone> I‚Äôm glad y‚Äôall played red earth before this
[0:30:44] <+fredan31> if they're going to use Morgan they should use the old 2D Sprite I don't care if it's a 3D game
[0:30:45] <+Jiggisnipe> clash is the correct term in more ways than one
[0:30:46] <DomonTrigger> This version has a way better roster on paper though
[0:30:46] <+emeraldsplasher> MUGEN is better than this
[0:30:47] <+xerotwo> This came around the near same timeframe as SVC CHAOS doodStare
[0:30:52] <JayEarly> @thedream_c yeah somehow that worked
[0:30:56] <michaelpolandwatcher> Hello Woolie can i interest you in a Witcher 2?
[0:30:57] <Qsmash_> they literally just threw all that shit away and went back to sprites
[0:31:03] <DingusMcBaseball> MUGEN is as good as the guy making the project is willing to make it
[0:31:06] <TigerClaws12> don't play your main
[0:31:06] <Solidnick18> bb tag DansGame
[0:31:07] <$emptyantics> I just want a TEPPEN FIGHTING GAME :(
[0:31:10] <Darren716> Oof\
[0:31:11] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yep LUL
[0:31:14] <@Solidus_113> Persona was the worst with it
[0:31:16] <+thedream_c> @Klefth yeah. The bottom line and quality worked out so until it stops, then the strategy is legit. MHW and RE team carrying the company for now.
[0:31:17] <+emeraldsplasher> BBTag doodBarf
[0:31:18] <Solidnick18> oh okay

[0:59:26] <Blank9> it's 10 horses tied together
[0:59:28] <JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[0:59:29] <JdotSweapA> theres a GAME happening here
[0:59:29] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> that's what it wants you to think
[0:59:30] <%CalderGaming> put the controls of a 1910s car in a 2021 body
[0:59:34] <VladDamien> Reggie plz
[0:59:34] <SableS139a> @MrGooseberryVT Sadly...
[0:59:36] <+thedream_c> lmaooo fake bacon
[0:59:40] <goztboy> this character select bgm sucks lol
[0:59:41] <dds333a> It's as if the stick had all it's labels moved
[0:59:43] <+thedream_c> turkey faked bacon
[0:59:44] <Solidnick18> Facon hmmm
[0:59:46] <JetpackMcQuack> Adapt Reggie
[0:59:46] <%patriotrenegade> I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs not Street Fighter!
[0:59:47] <BlackermanZX> the speedometer is missing some numbers
[0:59:50] <leith_aziz> I now see why I loved Strive so much despite some changes. It doesnt get to this point of feeling stripped down while also adding new moves and mechanics
[0:59:52] <+Mordexai0> Fun Fact: Ingrid has Egyptian Goddess references in her clothes and street fighter alpha 3 max lore.
[0:59:54] <+thedream_c> hahah Hauzer
[0:59:56] <+Jiggisnipe> naw
[0:59:58] <+thedream_c> big DINO energy
[0:59:59] <Super_Voltekka> There's a statue of Ravange in the background
[1:00:00] <tragicjohnson84> What is Hauzer from?
[1:00:00] <JdotSweapA> suddenly Dinosaurs...
[1:00:02] <%nicversus> That's exactly what Marvel vs Capcom Infinite feels like. It's the facon bits version of MvC
[1:00:02] <$emptyantics> IMAGINE FAKE BACON ConcernDoge
[1:00:02] <SableS139a> The OG project looked super promising too...
[1:00:03] <dds333a> Possibly, yeah
[1:00:04] <%ggbhtg> THAT'S WHAT ONO SAID THO
[1:00:04] <+eanscrale> can you blame them?
[1:00:06] <leith_aziz> Well..... this is weird
[1:00:09] <Solidnick18> it will eventually
[1:00:09] <+Mcmoblin> This game really doesn't count.
[1:00:11] <+Shmario> suddenly well animated characters
[1:00:13] <+GreyFox86> riptors mom
[1:00:13] <Ragezorx> well ono is gone so ingrid will never come back
[1:00:14] <+Jiggisnipe> they're like we already did Capcom vs Capcom Kappa
[1:00:14] <leith_aziz> WHAT KILLED THE DINOSAURS ?
[1:00:16] <PMda2nd> this is a cool matchup though
[1:00:16] <SableS139a> @tragicjohnson84 Red Earth/Warzard
[1:00:16] <+MrGooseberryVT> This game is the reason all we get is street fighter costumes for crossovers now
[1:00:18] <ThatGuyThere03> I feel like this game failing has more to do with the fact that this looks about as polished as some random mugen pack
[1:00:21] <armchairmaster_> what the fuck is that sprite
[1:00:21] <DaKnightWarrior> I love Red Earth so much.
[1:00:23] <%Irridium> with Ono gone maybe they'll try again... hopefully
[1:00:24] <+thedream_c> ho that sweep tho
[1:00:25] <Applecannon63> Ono the CG trailer whore
[1:00:25] <leith_aziz> THE ICE AAAAGGGGEEEE
[1:00:26] <dds333a> Red Earth has always looked amazing
[1:00:26] <$emptyantics> SourPls
[1:00:32] <PMda2nd> dino vs star space god
[1:00:33] <+thedream_c> this is like TvC giants but were REALLY unfair
[1:00:40] <+Mordexai0> @ragezorx Nah Bring her Back. Better than ever.
[1:00:40] <Solidnick18> what is that noise?
[1:00:42] <MrBaconJam> DINOSAURS VS ALIENS PogChamp
[1:00:42] <+GalacticaPhanto> Ok so real talk this theme is a odd guilty pleasure because I actually like this one
[1:00:47] <RealDurdyDan> This looks like a boss battle
[1:00:47] <Super_Voltekka> Ravange and Valdoll statues

[1:01:36] <leith_aziz> It looks so bad
[1:01:37] <Darren716> Reggie they didn't have time to think
[1:01:46] <+thedream_c> shitty alex? Not until u play TvC really
[1:01:47] <mr_sups> @oni_exe this game is that statement as a fighting game
[1:01:49] <+Willdog1993> Light as a feather, STIFF AS A BOARD!
[1:01:52] <%nicversus> This is like somebody handed ono a copy of mugen
[1:01:53] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> why aare the cutframes so RANDOM
[1:01:56] <+Mordexai0> the Goddess is lsls by the way
[1:01:56] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Alex forgot all his frames at home
[1:01:59] <+thedream_c> all Alex players are masochists unless they play TvC
[1:02:04] <oni_exe> @mr_sups I KNOW AND I HATE IT HERE
[1:02:08] <+Xero_J> SFIII animation this ain‚Äôt
[1:02:09] <leith_aziz> STOMP
[1:02:11] <Applecannon63> Ingrid would be better if they' redesign and make her less mary sue
[1:02:12] <+logoth_> Slow as hell fucking EX
[1:02:18] <Solidnick18> at ease ... loser
[1:02:21] <Adwark> This must have been some kind of competition "How fast you can push out seemingly complete game" LUL
[1:02:28] <dds333a> HE DOESN'T LOSE
[1:02:38] <+MrGooseberryVT> I swear Ingrid was in Tekken and Maximum Impact just the same character 3 times
[1:02:38] <LocalELizard> begone mollusk
[1:02:38] <leith_aziz> I wish Alex was played more in games. I find him a pretty cool character
[1:02:38] <+NopeBadguy> That was Bison levels of EX stomp floatiness
[1:02:49] <+thedream_c> game design? Nah lets put out a big crossover game
[1:02:50] <+FuqBoiSlim> This feels like a 9 month project
[1:02:50] <DedlokPM> https://clips.twitch.tv/ConsiderateFurryCamelSMOrc-JGRaha3-nr_YMNJf
[1:02:51] <goztboy> poor Reggie lol
[1:02:53] <deafmelone> You gotta do midnight bliss
[1:02:53] <$thespacerunaway> Gracious. I haven't thought about red earth in years
[1:02:56] <%ggbhtg> Are we really forcing Reggie to play this for the rest of the stream?
[1:02:58] <anarchistPastry> my day just keeps getting better LUL
[1:02:59] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> this is an anger DECADES in the making
[1:03:01] <+Jiggisnipe> does Demitri have Midnight Bliss?
[1:03:04] <dds333a> Reggie taking damage from this game
[1:03:09] <%nicversus> I'm dismayed at the lack of Mega Man 2 The Power Fighters representation in this game
[1:03:09] <leith_aziz> @MrGooseberryVT You're thinking of Lily for Tekken
[1:03:09] <+thedream_c> there are some 2020 fgs that look half baked but still are more complete than this game
[1:03:12] <deafmelone> @jiggisnipe Yes
[1:03:23] <DaKnightWarrior> This stage gets me everytime LUL
[1:03:27] <+Mordexai0> @applecannon63 The reason she's Mary sue is because she's a reference to Egyptian Goddess lsls. Also probably because she is likely made by Ono
[1:03:27] <blackkanye> Reggie is week to white damage. Gonna panic in a second
[1:03:37] <JdotSweapA> to capcom it was just a product. like sfv now
[1:03:41] <dds333a> @nicversus dude, you're telling me
[1:03:48] <+thedream_c> yeah Ingrid def feels like an Ono creation
[1:04:02] <%ggbhtg> @MrGooseberryVT and Mignon Beret or whoever from Max Impact 2
[1:04:08] <+thedream_c> as she was only highlighted as Ono's influence grew withint he company
[1:04:10] <leith_aziz> ?
[1:04:13] <leith_aziz> WTF........
[1:04:15] <Solidnick18> wtf is that
[1:04:21] <Applecannon63> Awwww

[1:04:25] <Th3rd3> Hydron go!
[1:04:28] <Zero_Fayth> ‚ÄúCome on, baby..!‚Äù
[1:04:30] <Super_Voltekka> They removed Jedah's boob inflation move
[1:04:32] <%nicversus> Hydron't act like y'all don't know
[1:04:33] <JdotSweapA> So heres a giant enemy crab
[1:04:33] <DomonTrigger> Does he have Midnight Bliss
[1:04:41] <oni_exe> I've seen enough content to know where this is going
[1:04:49] <+Xero_J> ...I beg your pardon, where did squid man come from?
[1:04:53] <mr_sups> Ou, la la
[1:04:56] <leith_aziz> Red Earth
[1:05:02] <brunoberserk> DO A MIDNIGHT BLISS
[1:05:03] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:05:04] <+thedream_c> even noobs should know the raging demon input :)
[1:05:06] <%Grimlockfly> plenty of new Midnight Bliss sprites doe
[1:05:11] <%ThisIsLloyd> whats up with the cephalopod
[1:05:14] <deafmelone> Try like mashing dp with punches
[1:05:19] <Solidnick18> fried squid
[1:05:19] <Th3rd3> grill squid
[1:05:24] <dds333a> hydron is a boss from red earth
[1:05:28] <%ggbhtg> @thedream_c but IS that the input tho
[1:05:31] <%ThisIsLloyd> a h
[1:05:34] <PMda2nd> what does the tiny squid do?
[1:05:35] <+BuckizcoBeet> To think that Demitri shares the same voice as Link...
[1:05:37] <$lumporr> ROUND START: JUMP IN!
[1:05:40] <anarchistPastry> so Hydron is from Red Earth, but Pyron is from Darkstalkers.... Kappa
[1:05:52] <Evendrag> CVS had the coolest sakura by far
[1:05:54] <JdotSweapA> knee press nightmare~
[1:05:55] <Evendrag> she sounds sick
[1:05:56] <leith_aziz> I'll give the game one credit. The hit impact
[1:06:16] <DomonTrigger> The hit noises are fun but so many animations got the weight sucked out of them
[1:06:19] <%ggbhtg> @leith_aziz ripped from CvS, tbh
[1:06:20] <KaiserMario> That's a super from the SF EX series, it's super cool
[1:06:23] <+Xero_J> I just noticed Sagat and Adon chilling in the background
[1:06:27] <+MrGooseberryVT> cool bison super
[1:06:35] <$lumporr> oh there's a dinosaur
[1:06:39] <+MrGooseberryVT> Imagine if they threw rival schools in but kept the 3d models
[1:06:40] <+thedream_c> more ShinAkuma666
[1:06:41] <leith_aziz> @ggbhtg Oh I know (kinda). So its not even original
[1:06:42] <Th3rd3> Sagat standing there thinking "Thanks god I'm not part of this weird thing"
[1:06:48] <%nicversus> Shin Akuma? Where's Metsu Akuma?
[1:06:50] <Evendrag> and what the fuck is a warzard
[1:06:53] <+thedream_c> @MrGooseberryVT they didn't wanna go full mugen there
[1:06:56] <+Jiggisnipe> @MrGooseberryVT they should have
[1:06:57] <Solidnick18> oh anakaris
[1:06:59] <+thedream_c> and this game is already in big mugen territory
[1:07:07] <+MrGooseberryVT> Just go hog-wild full mugen
[1:07:08] <+thedream_c> fax. SFV Karin is her own char
[1:07:10] <JinJun1738> This music mind numbing
[1:07:12] <leith_aziz> Gameplay wise ? Never tried her
[1:07:15] <JdotSweapA> hi oro..
[1:07:16] <anarchistPastry> @nicversus LUL
[1:07:20] <+thedream_c> SFV Karin is get into VT to get into her fun shit
[1:07:29] <Ragezorx> 15 fps oro
[1:07:37] <Evendrag> and her vtrigger doesnt even last that long
[1:07:38] <Super_Voltekka> The curiously attractive fishman is swimming in the water
[1:07:40] <+thedream_c> ewww that 3fps Oro
[1:07:40] <+MrBreckenridge> Karin in sf alpha 3 is a beast
[1:07:41] <oni_exe> ORO WHAT ARE YOU WTF
[1:07:44] <+Jiggisnipe> just noticed Oro sleeping LUL
[1:07:47] <leith_aziz> MESSTSU
[1:07:48] <%ggbhtg> Fireball motion then- ......
[1:07:49] <+thedream_c> who else is making a cameo in this background
[1:07:49] <Evendrag> shosh

[1:07:56] <AstrodropGaming> OWLgg
[1:07:57] <KaiserMario> @thedream_c I think you mean, "SFV is get into VT to get fun shit"
[1:08:13] <prime_name> Would it be accurate to say that BBCTB is what this game was trying to be?
[1:08:13] <+thedream_c> @KaiserMario damn. U gotta do Ed players like that too huh? And they only press 4 buttons
[1:08:14] <%nicversus> BREAKING: schoolgirl beaten to death in the dark by aging karate weirdo
[1:08:17] <Applecannon63> SFV Karin is just her Alpha ver limited by the SFV gimmick
[1:08:30] <dds333a> Oh man, love those sounds
[1:08:41] <+thedream_c> RIP mummy Sim
[1:08:47] <leith_aziz> @KaiserMario: To be fair, the game can give you access to fun shit, which is more that can be said than MK11 in general
[1:08:49] <Super_Voltekka> Anakaris doesn't have the backdash so he's totally worthless
[1:08:50] <%nicversus> You can see Oro's sack in this game
[1:08:58] <JdotSweapA> 160p
[1:09:00] <dds333a> Shin shoryuken'd
[1:09:00] <TheKazuma410> Nah that's 240p
[1:09:08] <TheKazuma410> Or yeah 160
[1:09:19] <%ggbhtg> Ingrid mirror, then throw this game in the furnace
[1:09:19] <Klefth> This character select theme is horrible :|
[1:09:36] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Ingrid's what happens when you hit the upgrade button, and then you immediately hit the "Fuck, Go back" button
[1:09:37] <%nicversus> It's fire guile
[1:09:42] <+Jiggisnipe> it's Fei Long
[1:09:42] <+thedream_c> @leith_aziz truly 2010's fg design. Teach noobs that the fun is in footsies/neutral and u truly get really fun when u save up resources.
[1:09:42] <$lumporr> mother fuck that makes me think my phone is vibrating
[1:09:50] <JdotSweapA> is that frigin Fei Long in the back?
[1:09:50] <mr_sups> Same!
[1:09:51] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[1:09:56] <+thedream_c> Fishboat Fei :p
[1:09:59] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> bweep bweep
[1:09:59] <Applecannon63> Didn't Ingrid also appear in Project x Zone?
[1:09:59] <+Mordexai0> Play Alpha 3 Max YOU COWARDS
[1:10:04] <Heefnoff> Why does his attack sound like a phone is vibriting
[1:10:06] <dds333a> Almost into everything
[1:10:08] <Heefnoff> vibrating
[1:10:08] <%guyalex> oh god I actually thought that was someone's phone earlier, buzzing on a hard surface haha
[1:10:09] <+thedream_c> wow this bg is depressing
[1:10:12] <Super_Voltekka> Fei Long Lei Lei and Yang make cameos
[1:10:16] <+thedream_c> Hsien Ko lounging
[1:10:21] <deafmelone> @applecannon63 Yeah
[1:10:21] <Gatolatte_PaPoPe> not atena
[1:10:22] <+Xero_J> Hsien-Ko in the background is a mood
[1:10:23] <$lumporr> it's so the opponent checks their phone during the match
[1:10:32] <$lumporr> wow but for real every time\
[1:10:37] <Klefth> That teleport sound effect is vile
[1:10:37] <+Mordexai0> @applecannon63 Yes. She is actually pretty funny in that game as someone who has played PXZ2
[1:10:40] <JdotSweapA> they ripped the background sprite of Tsien-ko in cvs2 and pasted it here..
[1:10:41] <Th3rd3> Fei Long, where are you going?
[1:10:43] <+Jiggisnipe> that really is a vibrate sound LUL
[1:10:43] <KaiserMario> Oh Woolie picked up that Gill alt costume
[1:10:44] <Heefnoff> That really sounds like a phone vibrating when he teleports lol
[1:10:44] <leith_aziz> @thedream_c I don't know if thats a positive. At least Strive is very fun even BEFORE you use RC. Its been a ride so far
[1:10:50] <prime_name> Is that Fei long's alpha art in the background?
[1:10:50] <%ggbhtg> YEETED
[1:10:53] <JdotSweapA> Yangs face looks like mud
[1:10:57] <%emperordread> WINgrid

[1:11:33] <Solidnick18> come on hauzer
[1:11:38] <+Jiggisnipe> and blurry Yang
[1:11:42] <Applecannon63> Man Feilong should come back in the next SF
[1:11:47] <+Xero_J> "I have a big head and little arms, I'm just not sure how well this plan was thought through."
[1:11:48] <+thedream_c> @leith_aziz StrIVe is def a different approach despite trying to be 'simpler'.
[1:12:05] <+thedream_c> wait does SFV have rekka chars?
[1:12:05] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:12:08] <Solidnick18> yeahhhhhh
[1:12:09] <JdotSweapA> NotLikeThis
[1:12:14] <+MrGooseberryVT> Put Hauzer in SFV
[1:12:17] <%ggbhtg> Ingrid was devoured by a T-Rex, AND ALL WAS GOOD
[1:12:22] <+krispen_wa> is this mugen?
[1:12:23] <leith_aziz> @thedream_c: And thank goodness for that.
[1:12:25] <DDDorsett> Y'all playing the BAD Capcom vs game lytWINCE lytWINCE lytWINCE
[1:12:26] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> hoo boy
[1:12:28] <%Axle13j> Jedah's ending is the fuckin best
[1:12:28] <Solidnick18> sure
[1:12:29] <DaKnightWarrior> YEYEYE
[1:12:30] <prime_name> YES
[1:12:30] <Super_Voltekka> Hauzer is supposed to walk towards the corpse, then stomp on you
[1:12:34] <%ggbhtg> Check out some Midnight Blisses too? @WoolieVersus
[1:12:34] <%PKSomething> I've never played or seen this game, who is ingrid and why does everyone hate her?
[1:12:35] <dds333a> Hoimei and Shaomei, I think
[1:12:40] <+thedream_c> lmaoo what did they NOT do
[1:12:42] <+Mordexai0> This game is good SHUT UP
[1:12:44] <cj_art> you should show off those midnight bliss sprites
[1:12:45] <pixel_river> LUL
[1:12:46] <vodska> a proper art direction wouldve done a lot for this game
[1:12:46] <SableS139a> The missing frames still hurt me
[1:12:48] <DomonTrigger> I only know the Jedah one that gets a callback in MvCI story mode
[1:12:52] <GothicLolitaAngel> I don‚Äôt hate her I love her design @pksomething
[1:12:55] <+thedream_c> lmao the game is good. meanwhile people gon dismiss NGBC
[1:12:59] <+Mordexai0> zyzxLmao zyzxLmao
[1:13:02] <%ggbhtg> Check out some Midnight Blisses too tho?? @WoolieVersus
[1:13:06] <Ragezorx> @PKSomething most of the hate is because she comes from a failed game, the rest of it is because shes anime and SF fans are insecure
[1:13:08] <deafmelone> @woolieversus can we some stuff midnight bliss and pharaoh curse stuff?
[1:13:14] <%PKSomething> @GothicLolitaAngel all I know is people see her and go OH GOD NO
[1:13:16] <leith_aziz> My biggest issue of this game from what i've seen is that it just feels like a MUGEN
[1:13:17] <+thedream_c> MVC2 may look bad, but it def don't look THAT stiff
[1:13:23] <%PKSomething> @Ragezorx Ah, ok, I see
[1:13:23] <DDDorsett> This game isn't good LUL
[1:13:27] <+eanscrale> So this is just Guilty Gear Isuka.
[1:13:32] <+thedream_c> and MVC2 has times where it def looks like a Mugen game
[1:13:34] <%PKSomething> thank you
[1:13:37] <Applecannon63> Ingrid feels out of place
[1:13:40] <dds333a> And they are nothing like they are in those in this
[1:13:40] <SableS139a> Ingrid's not that bad if you turn to PXZ2. For everything else though, after her original title fell through, everything went downhill outside of maybe Alpha 3 Double Upper.
[1:13:42] <Ragezorx> they dont like a little girl beating their ryus and sagats
[1:13:42] <diontmack> lol my first exposure to ingrid was PxZ2
[1:13:44] <leith_aziz> I just wish new moves were at least added to make it feel different
[1:13:50] <brunoberserk> you dont understand ... but you brain does dnoSMUG
[1:13:57] <aura_00> @Ragezorx so why don't the hate Sakura?
[1:14:00] <dds333a> They feel incomplete
[1:14:09] <oni_exe> in short: THIS IS NOT MY ALEX
[1:14:13] <+Zanzibar_Junker> Are you guys gonna play something else?
[1:14:15] <Ragezorx> @aura_00 good question, make sure to ask that to ingrid haters
[1:14:17] <leith_aziz> New moves can change perspective in a good awy, but they dont even get that
[1:14:19] <Klefth> It's like being served veggie loaf and them telling you it's steak
[1:14:20] <%ggbhtg> What is Pharaoh's Curse? @deafmelone
[1:14:21] <+thedream_c> as I wrote before, Alex players are masochists unless they played TvC alex
[1:14:24] <+Xero_J> I dig Ingrid's design and I liked her in SFA3 Max, at least
[1:14:30] <dds333a> Sure is
[1:14:33] <Solidnick18> LUL
[1:14:35] <+Mordexai0> @diontmack She was fine in PXZ2
[1:14:37] <SableS139a> @diontmack Congrats my dude. You got the best interpretation of the character (and a legit good one too). PXZ does a lot of characters justice.
[1:14:53] <leith_aziz> Will Alex ever get buffed to top tier for once ?
[1:15:05] <+thedream_c> @leith_aziz nope but his most fun version is probably TvC
[1:15:06] <%ggbhtg> and some Pharaoh's Curses, apparently @WoolieVersus
[1:15:09] <leith_aziz> Give the man a break
[1:15:11] <%ggbhtg> whatever those are
[1:15:12] <VladDamien> It's the Batman and Robin of the Capcom games LUL
[1:15:13] <Ragezorx> oh another reason why people hate ingrid is because she appeared in SFA3 Max, saying that dictator's power was originally hers. that was wack.
[1:15:14] <+thedream_c> and watching Alex in TvC is pretty fun too
[1:15:17] <dds333a> Demitri has always been a creature of Supreme taste
[1:15:20] <DaKnightWarrior> Bad timeline.
[1:15:20] <+Jiggisnipe> it was probably bad too
[1:15:21] <JdotSweapA> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[1:15:25] <Applecannon63> @leith_aziz he did got buffed in 5 but fairly in B Tier
[1:15:26] <%saladin1911> Wow, a bunch of people were all like, "Boo! Yuk! Ingrid is the worst." When asked why nobody has a reply LUL
[1:15:30] <DDDorsett> Capcom didd this while SNK did NGBC
[1:15:33] <Super_Voltekka> Any MAME testers in the chat wanna dump the prototype ROM for us?
[1:15:40] <JdotSweapA> couldv been better than rival schools but noooope

[1:15:47] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[1:15:47] <+Xero_J> WHY IS HE TINY
[1:15:48] <+thedream_c> Alex players who never played him in TvC don't know power nor fun
[1:15:49] <DDDorsett> LUL
[1:15:50] <+Jiggisnipe> that's cute lol

[1:16:03] <DDDorsett> Female Guile LUL
[1:16:04] <Ragezorx> is that the karin costume origin?

[1:34:57] <brunoberserk> PIT FIGHTER ?
[1:34:57] <Super_Voltekka> Did you know that Ingrid calls you a whippersnapper in some of her CFE win quotes? I'm not joking
[1:34:59] <Ragezorx> EleGiggle
[1:35:05] <+thedream_c> 8ing I give credit too
[1:35:08] <+678saintglock> oh shit i didn't catch that one tho
[1:35:16] <stephyesterday> yea climax scramble, it's uhhh. not the best but it's fun to press buttons with friends
[1:35:17] <sunnythedrunk> FeelsBadMan
[1:35:23] <leith_aziz> About ASW rollback, im fairly certain BBCF will be that game since the modders that ASW hired were already working on that
[1:35:24] <+tuchpi> Basement king LUL
[1:35:34] <alphalejandro> Woolie have Daigo fights
[1:35:37] <%Kriss1827> @WoolieVersus if Persona 5 Arena comes out should it be sprite art or 3d like strive?
[1:35:39] <dds333a> Reggie played Melee at some places, or whatever
[1:35:39] <Applecannon63> climax scramble is sadly meh
[1:35:40] <Ragezorx> @leith_aziz wait, arcsys hired the modders? source?
[1:35:42] <DaKnightWarrior> Almost took down Daigo tho Kappa

[1:35:48] <brunoberserk> Reggie , the CHAMPION
[1:35:52] <%Lion_kun> But Woolie, you almost outfootsied Daigo
[1:35:52] <+tuchpi> @alphalejandro losing in pools isn't placing anything LUL
[1:35:56] <oni_exe> You guys should check out Rev 0, its a mod of Rev 2 that seems really cool
[1:36:02] <%Grimlockfly> Daigo was most hype
[1:36:04] <SubliminaIMessages> You managed to piss off Daigo tho LUL
[1:36:06] <+b_aleph> Wishlist for P5A? Let's talk about P5A!
[1:36:07] <leith_aziz> @Ragezorx They did! I dont have a source unfortunately. But you can just ask people
[1:36:11] <+thedream_c> @Kriss1827 IMO maybe 3d. Whatever is easier to create assets for andflip them
[1:36:13] <%ggbhtg> Did Ono actually say "we already made a Capcom Vs already, so no dice"? I've heard it from Max multiple times over the years, so he probably had inside info on it. @WoolieVersus
[1:36:18] <dds333a> Woolie is NO PRO
[1:36:19] <ThatGuyThere03> ay but you played daigo tho
[1:36:22] <+thedream_c> lmaooo this show isn't about how to get to GFs indeed
[1:36:23] <%emperordread> I'm just shit stirrin <3
[1:36:27] <sunnythedrunk> Woolie did take games off Octo in Strive
[1:36:30] <Allenou> you need to understand that Woolie is not good at fighting games LUL
[1:36:30] <leith_aziz> I'll be fine with either artstyles for P5 Arena
[1:36:37] <+thedream_c> this is Saturday Morning Scrublords
[1:36:38] <Ragezorx> @leith_aziz if thats recent then thats good news for bbcf fans

[1:36:55] <%Lion_kun> Can we forget Kasumi ever existed and put Sophia instead?
[1:36:59] <+thedream_c> if you arelooking for ways to get to Grand Finals, u gotta do more soul searching than watching influencers :)
[1:37:04] <+GerryOmega> i want "play to learn" tatted
[1:37:06] <%ggbhtg> woolieFUN woolieFUN woolieFUN
[1:37:07] <Murdercles> i think they just meant matches won in tourney, not winning a tourney
[1:37:09] <Applecannon63> Honestly Winning is overrated
[1:37:11] <+Mcmoblin> Not just win a tournament but to win and top 8 consistently? You are a legend
[1:37:27] <+PerfectDare> Turns out Woolie secretly the best in the world... at a game he hasn't played yet.
[1:37:41] <balthazar758> woolie fights for fun. and salt.
[1:37:43] <leith_aziz> @Ragezorx They were hired the moment ASW helped with the mode and made it an official patch (+R) The modders were already working on BBCF so now it should only be easier
[1:37:45] <Allenou> Wins are temporary, fun is eternal
[1:37:57] <Ragezorx> oh i see
[1:37:57] <$lumporr> what the fuck

[1:39:01] <leith_aziz> @geistuser There's the old Guilty Gears. Xrd Rev 2 is the closest, but it doesnt use Rollback. +R does, but I would recommend you just wait for Strive
[1:39:01] <SomersaultJustice> heyyyy it' lee

[1:39:51] <+PerfectDare> This game is really a hidden gem.
[1:39:53] <blackkanye> Yo the sprite work is nice
[1:39:53] <+thedream_c> IGS used their own specific chipset
[1:40:00] <%nicversus> The IGS is like a higher powered Neo Geo
[1:40:01] <%ggbhtg> @Thunderhog just like my Chinese anime Kappa
[1:40:02] <+thedream_c> but what they accompolished with it with this game is SOMETHING else
[1:40:05] <+duskrush> Her arms are reminding me of Kung Pow when he pretends he's a bird
[1:40:11] <HelluvaNohbody> Why the animation so fluid

[1:41:42] <deafmelone> Good shit, I popped off when I saw it for the first time
[1:41:42] <Super_Voltekka> Martial Masters and Dong Dong are two of the best Chinese video games ever made period
[1:41:47] <Arek_1> Either A B C D one row or
[1:41:54] <Arek_1> A C B D
[1:42:05] <%ggbhtg> LIGHT PUNCH sajamInfinite
[1:42:05] <%ChoculaUltra> the human race took the 2d sprite era for granted dammit FeelsBadMan
[1:42:11] <Arek_1> Damn, A C top row, B D bottom row.
[1:42:18] <+PerfectDare> Oh snap, it's Shun Di
[1:42:35] <+thedream_c> China made another one which was like a USF4 rip off but its hilarious as it has various different engines in game
[1:42:36] <%ggbhtg> @ChoculaUltra Blame the CGI beasts
[1:42:59] <stephyesterday> these animations are INSANE
[1:42:59] <+Mordexai0> @thedream_c Wait, what game?
[1:43:15] <dds333a> Yeah, kinda
[1:43:19] <+thedream_c> @Mordexai0 something 3 kingdoms related. I forgot the full name.
[1:43:20] <leith_aziz> I mean 3D was ground breaking, but we should have still left a spot for 2D games as well in the industry
[1:43:28] <%ggbhtg> it ain't

[1:43:44] <ManaSpurt> The animations in this game. Cray-Zee!
[1:43:46] <Arek_1> Since B+C is commonly used here, maybe A B C D one row would be more comfortable.
[1:43:48] <+Mcmoblin> Zafina could never
[1:43:51] <oni_exe> why does this game look so COOL?!?
[1:43:52] <leith_aziz> Oh. Zafina uses those styles
[1:43:54] <+Xero_J> If Skullgirls is any indication, 2D ain't done just yet
[1:43:56] <+GalacticaPhanto> what happened to IGS? I'm guessing this was expensive to make for arcade cabs?
[1:43:58] <Applecannon63> Straight up a scorpion
[1:44:03] <oni_exe> AND WHY AM I LEARNING ABT IT NOW??
[1:44:03] <Gatolatte_PaPoPe> ive seen scorpion on mugen

[1:50:35] <+tuchpi> those arms Kreygasm
[1:50:36] <+thedream_c> 3v3 is an extra mode in thisgame I think
[1:50:37] <leith_aziz> Sun Wokung type kid
[1:50:38] <%nicversus> Scorpion (but not THAT scorpion)
[1:50:40] <+thedream_c> this game is normally 1v1
[1:50:45] <+aqua546> her arms tho
[1:50:45] <SomersaultJustice> clempsMonke
[1:50:46] <SubliminaIMessages> ü¶ß

[1:50:58] <+thedream_c> its kinda like those old games that offered 1v1 but gave you a 3v3 or multi team option
[1:50:59] <leith_aziz> I think its written as "Son Wukong" ?
[1:51:00] <%ggbhtg> Maximum monke
[1:51:03] <Super_Voltekka> Fun Fact: There's a legit naked boob in Scorpion's ending

[1:51:48] <DrunkenDice> ????
[1:51:49] <+thedream_c> @Mordexai0 eh. Not really. Skullgirls could be played in 1v3 in mind. I'm talking about older games that were SPECFICIALLY 1v1. But gave a team battle option like old tekkens I think before tag
[1:51:50] <%ggbhtg> I member
[1:51:53] <ManaSpurt> Terry killed that thing.

[2:01:22] <$lumporr> @thedream_c come on, give me the sword
[2:01:22] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:01:27] <+Reverend_Roscoe> RESPECTABO
[2:01:30] <DaKnightWarrior> This games so cool.
[2:01:40] <+thedream_c> soft throw huh
[2:01:44] <yuribo26> What am I looking at
[2:01:47] <+thedream_c> the knockdown is still there. Get dat OKI
[2:01:52] <goztboy> that throw feels disrespectful lol
[2:01:54] <$Dungeon00X> Ah, Nasty Badger style
[2:02:11] <dds333a> @kewpaarts it's a real practical throw too
[2:02:12] <+thedream_c> i wonder if Drunken Masters hitbox adjusts in his idle animation
[2:02:15] <$lumporr> your Nasty Badger is no match for my Chunky Monkey
[2:02:22] <Applecannon63> Dead balls
[2:02:29] <$razielhex> brass monkey > Chunky Monkey
[2:02:31] <yuribo26> Is this a street fighter 3 bootleg?
[2:02:38] <+thedream_c> i forgot the last time I've seen played in an offline tourney
[2:02:41] <+thedream_c> was it Combo Breaker?
[2:02:47] <+Renkaru> this game is so sick
[2:02:52] <Applecannon63> @yuribo26 it is a far from that
[2:03:03] <yuribo26> @Applecannon63 I'm so confused
[2:03:05] <$Dungeon00X> This should be at EVO, damn.
[2:03:11] <+thedream_c> cuz Combo Breaker will play/stream some lil known FGs as long as there is a community for it
[2:03:18] <+Renkaru> its wushu 3rd strike
[2:03:28] <Applecannon63> it is more like Snk
[2:03:31] <JdotSweapA> Scorpion style is immensely strong and immune to nearly any weapon When it's properly used it is almost invincible~
[2:03:32] <+thedream_c> nah even ANIMEVO never touched this
[2:03:49] <+thedream_c> and ANIMEVO was a big community at EVO who did side game tourneys
[2:04:04] <+thedream_c> oh yeah thats nasty
[2:04:09] <+thedream_c> send out a moving shadow
[2:04:22] <%AlteisenReiseZ> reinstalling fightcade now lul
[2:04:24] <%ggbhtg> I mean, I could
[2:04:25] <dds333a> Martial Masters has a fair amount of knowledge, but yeah, it's virtually unknown
[2:04:26] <+thedream_c> FC2
[2:04:38] <DaKnightWarrior> Ready to see some killers.
[2:04:42] <+thedream_c> yeah it has a base knowledge board if you look around
[2:04:42] <+Renkaru> the sprite work is really nice
[2:04:51] <+thedream_c> i think JWONG played this game on stream awhile back too
[2:04:57] <+thedream_c> like 2 years ago or something
[2:05:07] <dds333a> I wish I was at home right about now.
[2:05:12] <%ggbhtg> did you mean, a couple months ago? @thedream_c
[2:05:15] <%ggbhtg> cuz it was
[2:05:18] <GarbageNirvana> Folks really gotta get out of the mindset that Chinese = knockoff
[2:05:19] <+thedream_c> maybe it was a couple months
[2:05:29] <+thedream_c> it maybe be a knockoff, but don't knock the effort
[2:05:40] <+thedream_c> this is HIGH tier effort for a animtions in an FG
[2:05:41] <jactuscack83> lol I actually saw this game in Taiwan in arcades in the early 2000s
[2:05:41] <dds333a> Oh well, not like I'm particularly all that good anyway, KEKW
[2:05:46] <Super_Voltekka> You can pick the same character in the same team? WutFace
[2:05:48] <+cloudman_exe> I'm late as hell but goddamn this game has amazing sprites
[2:05:51] <+Renkaru> itsn ot really a knockoff its pretty unique
[2:06:01] <+thedream_c> yeah the team fight version is not robust. Its a 1v1 fighter at the end
[2:06:12] <+cloudman_exe> I wouldn't be surprised if 3rd Strike animators we're behind this.
[2:06:19] <+thedream_c> nah defnot 3S animators
[2:06:24] <+thedream_c> IGS def got their own talents
[2:06:32] <+thedream_c> peep some of their other high effort titles
[2:06:48] <+thedream_c> wow the cheeks peekin
[2:07:02] <dds333a> Like I said, spicy Reggie out here
[2:07:05] <%ggbhtg> midler
[2:07:08] <deafmelone> IGS made the killing blade right?
[2:07:08] <@Solidus_113> MIdler
[2:07:10] <+thedream_c> oooh red snake got a sneaky backdash strike move
[2:07:10] <%CalderGaming> "red snake! red snake!" reggie insists as he slowly shrinks and turns into a corn cob
[2:07:12] <anarchistPastry> Midler
[2:07:12] <%ggbhtg> I thought so too
[2:07:13] <yuribo26> @GarbageNirvana I'm not saying that its a knockoff because its chinese, just because it REALLY looks like 3rd strike
[2:07:29] <+thedream_c> lookslike 3s? Makes me think more like Garou
[2:07:33] <+thedream_c> with pixel detail
[2:07:36] <alphalejandro> But Jojo Heritage Midler
[2:07:39] <+thedream_c> 3S got the rotoscope deal goin
[2:07:39] <stonestring93> is this snk?
[2:07:47] <+thedream_c> IGS own hardware
[2:07:49] <dds333a> Just kinda in aesthetics, especially since Midler didn't have anything but a dress in the manga
[2:07:57] <+thedream_c> but someone did say IGS hardware is like amped up neo geo
[2:08:02] <yuribo26> Watermelon tech PogChamp
[2:08:09] <yuribo26> Pineappel?
[2:08:12] <GarbageNirvana> And Fatal Fury looked like SFII but it clearly wasn't
[2:08:14] <+loukemia83> the damage on that Watermelon was HUGE
[2:08:14] <Super_Voltekka> Someone tell them about the secret characters
[2:08:16] <+Mordexai0> You guys should unlock Saojin
[2:08:22] <PMda2nd> I've never heard of it until today
[2:08:22] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:08:24] <+thedream_c> never took off? I mean its hard to promote own IPs even back then too
[2:08:26] <jactuscack83> Saojin and True Lotus Master
[2:08:33] <Murdercles> can you fix the framing so we can see the player names?
[2:08:35] <DaKnightWarrior> When did this game come out?
[2:08:40] <dds333a> As DP would say, Pineapple Surprise
[2:08:44] <tacostarvedbeast> was this game after third strike? feeling like someone took shaun's gimmick and expanded on it
[2:08:47] <jactuscack83> 99, in Taiwan
[2:08:48] <ainda_> its for the developers propritary hardware which was only really popular in Taiwan iirc
[2:08:57] <+thedream_c> oh operation scorpio
[2:09:06] <+678saintglock> yeah i definitely need to hop on here and press buttons
[2:09:08] <dds333a> '99
[2:09:09] <GarbageNirvana> This was around the same time as 3S
[2:09:20] <+thedream_c> oh Operation Scorpio be that movie
[2:09:27] <Super_Voltekka> They also made some really great beatemups too
[2:09:27] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Reika is kinda smug
[2:09:33] <XfourtwoX> The studio behind this game usec tgo do great pixel art, today they make mosou mmo for the asian market FailFish
[2:09:37] <balthazar758> this company also made a metal slug clone called "demon front". it's honestly impressive how similar it was.
[2:09:39] <+thedream_c> xie xie
[2:09:40] <puluxor> Seriously, this is going right in my "cool fighting games that I'll never play because I can't even master the ones I'm already on" pile tyrantPain
[2:09:43] <%akuda_bar> @WoolieVersus player names are cut off a smidge
[2:09:49] <dds333a> Some really fun beat em ups, none of which i have beaten
[2:09:58] <jactuscack83> mei guanxi
[2:10:00] <+thedream_c> oooh spectral vs generation is a PSP one too
[2:10:13] <deafmelone> That‚Äôs really cool
[2:10:20] <+thedream_c> eyah IGS made their money off that duanyst warriors style beat em up
[2:10:23] <%akuda_bar> stupid finnicky streaming software
[2:10:24] <theyblamedthebeasts> I love how uninterested some of the background characters are.
[2:10:24] <+FuqBoiSlim> @xfourtwox seeing good studios getting sent into mobile or MMO hell is a special type of sad
[2:10:26] <+thedream_c> Legends of Valor
[2:10:33] <Murdercles> ABG in the house LUL
[2:10:35] <+cloudman_exe> I can already see this game being remade with a cool, lo-fi hiphop aesthetic
[2:10:41] <+thedream_c> one of the Legens of Valour is pretty tight tho. I play it on my emus.
[2:10:43] <Arek_1> This game's resolution is 448x224. Nice. That means that they squeeze in extra detail horizontally and then correct for aspect ratio. Just like Capcom fighters.
[2:11:04] <+thedream_c> yeah these taiwan devs knew the curve
[2:11:09] <dds333a> everywhere else in 0
[2:11:28] <anarchistPastry> yo we switched languages?
[2:11:30] <dds333a> *01,yeah in US
[2:11:39] <+thedream_c> IGS hardware probably was expensive too ship out too
[2:11:45] <Super_Voltekka> Spooky should stream this
[2:11:47] <%nicversus> Everything on the IGS is relatively obscure
[2:11:47] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yeah that sounds early 2000s/late 90s
[2:11:53] <+thedream_c> remember how South America got less capcom hardware but more bootleg SNK hardware? ALl logistics and economics
[2:11:57] <theyblamedthebeasts> is this the same drunken master guy who appears in the GIFG intro?
[2:12:04] <+678saintglock> yep
[2:12:05] <%nicversus> Demon Front, which is basically just a bootleg Metal Slug is also pretty rad
[2:12:05] <+thedream_c> so IGS hardware stuff only really moved around Asia
[2:12:22] <+thedream_c> yeah Demon Front is VERY well done for a MS rip off
[2:12:38] <+thedream_c> yeee shadow moves be nutty in this game
[2:13:01] <+678saintglock> how do you do shadow moves again
[2:13:02] <puluxor> Sick animation
[2:13:12] <%nicversus> yeah calling it a metal slug bootleg is a bit reductive on my part, there's a lot of unique ideas. It does steal some visual design from wargraft a little bit but honestly it's pretty unique
[2:13:14] <+thedream_c> monkey faust huh
[2:13:15] <yuribo26> Those animations are really cool
[2:13:16] <KUYAmoPESh> Duuurian!
[2:13:21] <%nicversus> *warcraft
[2:13:21] <Murdercles> @678saintglock qcf or qcb and BC
[2:13:25] <jactuscack83> durians in there
[2:13:28] <+thedream_c> HAHAHA
[2:13:30] <+thedream_c> OHs
[2:13:37] <+thedream_c> htrow fruit, do overheads
[2:13:44] <+thedream_c> give zero fux
[2:13:46] <XfourtwoX> DURIAN PROJECTILES!!!! WutFace
[2:13:50] <SomersaultJustice> bonk
[2:13:54] <jactuscack83> projectile druians
[2:13:54] <+FuqBoiSlim> That apple chipped her out.
[2:13:58] <%nicversus> Fruity KO
[2:14:00] <+thedream_c> oooh chip damage
[2:14:01] <+thedream_c> hold dat
[2:14:09] <%nicversus> Fruit Fighter
[2:14:16] <+loukemia83> This is really cool, but 1v1 or tagging in would be better
[2:14:22] <Meltgar> So this is a "hidden" fighting game?
[2:14:24] <dds333a> Melon Masters
[2:14:31] <+thedream_c> yeah horizontal shadow moves look nice for extenders. But the real nasty one is shit that covers space
[2:14:34] <Meltgar> Banana slammers the arcade game Kappa
[2:14:39] <+thedream_c> LMAOO crossup?
[2:14:40] <jactuscack83> get a jackfruit in there
[2:14:45] <deafmelone> There is 1v1 mode, that‚Äôs what it is normally
[2:14:52] <+thedream_c> yeah this is a 1v1 game normally
[2:15:01] <+thedream_c> but as I wrote games back then would offer team battle modes
[2:15:03] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> HOLD THAT SHIT
[2:15:05] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[2:15:07] <DaKnightWarrior> LUL
[2:15:08] <dds333a> @meltgar it's a legit fighting game
[2:15:08] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[2:15:11] <oni_exe> LUL
[2:15:13] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> <3
[2:15:14] <+FuqBoiSlim> monkey boy got the gon freecs shape up I'm realizing
[2:15:23] <oni_exe> yo is there a tierlist for this game?
[2:15:23] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:15:35] <Meltgar> @dds333a Oh i meant by, those games that get overshadowed by KoF, SF in their time, thanks for info tho!
[2:15:39] <Arek_1> INodWhenILose. LUL
[2:15:55] <+PerfectDare> Yo, did you unlock true lotus master?
[2:16:04] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus top of the screen is cropped off
[2:16:10] <jactuscack83> you need True Lotus
[2:16:11] <dds333a> @meltgar Oh, I gotcha, like "obscure". yeah, it's mostly unknown.
[2:16:25] <dds333a> It has a player base, but it's rather small
[2:16:29] <DSD24> I like Scorpions oufit
[2:16:48] <+thedream_c> its inspired from a movie
[2:16:48] <+loukemia83> imagine you're about to get in a street fight with a dude and he starts crawling around like this guy
[2:16:58] <+thedream_c> this game is a homage to kung fu films of old
[2:17:07] <+thedream_c> so if you area watcher, these references be hittin
[2:17:11] <%nicversus> Drunken Ghost attack
[2:17:16] <oni_exe> @loukemia83 LUL
[2:17:23] <dds333a> @thedream_c Yessir
[2:17:27] <XfourtwoX> @dds333a game is broken with tons of easy infinite combos, there was a update version but is still broken sadly
[2:17:41] <KUYAmoPESh> That un holy amount of alcohol consumption. lul
[2:17:44] <+thedream_c> yeah this game is fleshed out but balance wise, forget it
[2:17:51] <jactuscack83> Scott Hall consumes more
[2:17:56] <+thedream_c> still game looks fun for wht it is
[2:18:11] <GarbageNirvana> Why don't we have more games about kung fu anyway?
[2:18:14] <%nicversus> looka t this jojo stand
[2:18:15] <DSD24> Wow is Lotus Master the final boss?
[2:18:19] <PMda2nd> heroes of wrestling amount of alcohol
[2:18:23] <+thedream_c> back in the old days when hardware was outand its hard to make balancing unless its another iteration
[2:18:23] <jactuscack83> True Lotus Master is the fi nal boss
[2:18:35] <+PerfectDare> no @DSD24, True lotus master is final
[2:18:39] <DaKnightWarrior> That SNK super!
[2:18:48] <DSD24> @GarbageNirvana We do got that New Kung Fu game from Slocap called Sifu on the horizon
[2:19:04] <Meltgar> NOICE
[2:19:07] <dds333a> @garbagenirvana there are some that are trash
[2:19:10] <+thedream_c> yeahthere is also thatshaolin vs wutang game. But this game does it so much better.
[2:19:19] <+panlakes> Is there a drunken master character in this?
[2:19:25] <+thedream_c> but of course
[2:19:29] <DSD24> Ooo Red Snake looks cool
[2:19:32] <dds333a> @panlakes you just missed him
[2:19:34] <Meltgar> @panlakes You missed him in the 1st match, old man fighter
[2:19:38] <+panlakes> dangit
[2:19:40] <+FuqBoiSlim> nah this red snake color got me feeling strange
[2:19:49] <jactuscack83> a very drunk old man
[2:19:52] <+thedream_c> melanated Red Skin Kreygasm
[2:19:56] <+thedream_c> Snake I mean
[2:20:10] <alexsumac> This certainly is one of the best 2D fighting games, when it comes to animation. And I've never heard about this existence.
[2:20:26] <DSD24> Yeah she looks great
[2:20:30] <%nicversus> hahaha thedream_c that coulda got you in trouble
[2:20:33] <+thedream_c> yeah I've only heard about this game like a decade ago
[2:20:43] <+678saintglock> that was so fun omg
[2:20:48] <DSD24> Sonic the Fighters?
[2:20:53] <+thedream_c> backwhen I was talking with others about underrated and obscure FGs
[2:20:53] <%ggbhtg> GBA game
[2:21:00] <fIashman92> GBA game
[2:21:01] <+cloudman_exe> Sonic Battle is a GBA game
[2:21:05] <%SveriSageAdvice> Sonic Battle isnt really a fighter, its a Powerstone at best
[2:21:06] <+thedream_c> Sega figthing all stars
[2:21:09] <dds333a> the one with Emerl
[2:21:09] <anarchistPastry> its a GBA sonic arena brawler, think Custom Robo
[2:21:09] <%LastHazzerd> sonic battle is like an arena brawler with cards
[2:21:11] <%Thunderhog> It's not a traditional fighter. Sonic battle's a gba arena fighter
[2:21:15] <Blank9> sonic battle is cool
[2:21:16] <%nicversus> Sonic the Fighters rules you take that back woolie
[2:21:24] <%LastHazzerd> we'd have to have a debate over if it's a fighter or not
[2:21:25] <dds333a> Or Gemerl, fuck, I forget
[2:21:27] <$Dungeon00X> Sonic Battle is so broken it's funny.
[2:21:34] <fIashman92> It's where half the Sonic Mugen sprites come from
[2:21:45] <+Mordexai0> @lasthazzerd The cards thing only applies to Emerl
[2:21:53] <dds333a> Sonic Battle is no good, but the sprites are sick
[2:21:57] <%LastHazzerd> wait, is Sonic an anime arena fighter?
[2:22:02] <%nicversus> Thaaaat's no good
[2:22:05] <%ggbhtg> Is Sonic Battle good? I dunno. Should we look at it? Yes.
[2:22:11] <jactuscack83> True Lotus Master
[2:22:12] <%Sparkseid> Sparkseid subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months!
[2:22:13] <+thedream_c> saojin yeah

[2:22:19] <dds333a> He's here
[2:22:19] <XfourtwoX> she a joke character
[2:22:19] <+thedream_c> i forgot Saojins lore but she's a reporter or something
[2:22:20] <%ggbhtg> You already had SaoJin up there, I think
[2:22:22] <+thedream_c> and she has a gang with her
[2:22:28] <dds333a> *she

[2:23:48] <BUDderzIllA> they're practicing their shots on the background
[2:23:53] <dds333a> TESTIFY with these claws
[2:24:04] <+thedream_c> did TIGER just say moogoo gai pan?
[2:24:05] <jactuscack83> the power of Christ
[2:24:05] <+loukemia83> These British Colonial soldiers ready to put down some opium riots
[2:24:08] <+FuqBoiSlim> @floralkami never got a console port.
[2:24:16] <+TopTieramisu> chizuru vs cody
[2:24:18] <%nicversus> look at that guy jerkin his musket
[2:24:27] <+thedream_c> yeah IGS focused more on their Legend of Valour title that ACTUALLY got ports in the future
[2:24:29] <%nicversus> I guess it's a rifle but still
[2:24:32] <floralkami> @lasthazzerd he IS a christian preacher
[2:24:32] <jactuscack83> that guy certainly is cleaning his rifle
[2:24:35] <+thedream_c> so I guess Martial Masters def didn't hit financially
[2:24:39] <+TopTieramisu> TIGER CLOW
[2:24:50] <jactuscack83> can't stop cleaning his rifle back there
[2:24:50] <+thedream_c> AMEN

[2:25:10] <dds333a> yeah, it's a roundhouse alright
[2:25:16] <DSD24> Berserker Barrage!
[2:25:18] <Super_Voltekka> You can tell he's not voiced by a real Westerner
[2:25:22] <weapon000> it Tiger like an English Missionary?
[2:25:27] <+thedream_c> yes he is
[2:25:28] <floralkami> @fuqboislim I know, but like... no one has talked about it --well come to think of it, this may be the first time she's been shown on a prominent show.
[2:25:35] <+thedream_c> spreading the good of Gawd in a foreign land
[2:25:39] <snowmanie> can't let any foreigners into the British zone
[2:25:51] <floralkami> I don't remember James Chen unlocking Saojin
[2:25:54] <jactuscack83> they are having crumpets
[2:26:02] <+thedream_c> SToner Scorpion
[2:26:06] <dds333a> He was doing it, yeah
[2:26:07] <ainda_> i like that the british level is imperialsm and racism + some poor guy begging a rich guy for something and him saying no
[2:26:09] <DSD24> The Rock?
[2:26:35] <floralkami> @ainda_ ... yeah?

[2:26:56] <DSD24> She was throwing hands
[2:26:58] <dds333a> She's a reporter, iirc
[2:26:58] <+loukemia83> don't pick sean unless you want to style on some fools
[2:26:58] <+thedream_c> Mom i think requires technique
[2:26:59] <floralkami> I want more mom
[2:27:04] <+FuqBoiSlim> Moms can have fun too
[2:27:16] <%nicversus> I feel like this game wouldn't be all that well remembered even if it did live on through home ports
[2:27:18] <+thedream_c> yeah i thought the lore isthat she's a reporter
[2:27:18] <ainda_> @floralkami yeah historically accurate
[2:27:20] <floralkami> we need to find the Mom tech
[2:27:36] <%AlteisenReiseZ> OH WORD

[2:28:21] <dds333a> Woolie picked Drunken Master twice before
[2:28:23] <Arek_1> How do you setup dipswitches for matches? Is that allowed?
[2:28:23] <+vaporousTippler> For a second, I thought they were fighting in the zoo.

[2:29:39] <floralkami> does anyone else feel like this music would bang with just a little drum rework?
[2:29:43] <dds333a> Not all of them, anyway
[2:29:46] <+thedream_c> run up throw
[2:29:53] <alexsumac> There is a secret (joke?) character called Saojin.
[2:29:53] <%nicversus> fighting game backgrounds are a lost art
[2:29:54] <ManaSpurt> @Boner_Girl It's more racist that that was the first thing your mind put together.
[2:29:54] <+thedream_c> that looks like some cheap throw bait
[2:29:59] <neraren> Jimmy Chooooos
[2:30:10] <jactuscack83> Durians!!
[2:30:19] <+TopTieramisu> CHIMICHUUU
[2:30:21] <floralkami> @boner_girl yeah, no... nice reach
[2:30:26] <dds333a> @nicversus you are so right, dude. Although there are still great ones today
[2:30:30] <PMda2nd> fruit zoning
[2:30:33] <+thedream_c> Crane got CHEEKS
[2:30:39] <%nicversus> oh yeah there are still people keeping the art alive for sure
[2:30:55] <weapon000> break open the Durian for a poison dot crendorSkittles
[2:30:59] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> monkey man does it all
[2:31:10] <DaKnightWarrior> Monkey boys good.
[2:31:25] <+FuqBoiSlim> imagine if watermelon set ups were real
[2:31:27] <+thedream_c> andthe whiff punish
[2:31:27] <floralkami> @manaspurt man, the more I think about it, the more I hate it LUL
[2:31:33] <rasamune> Durians are tasty though
[2:31:37] <DSD24> I like Monkey Boy's running animation
[2:31:39] <MichaelOfCainhurst> monke
[2:31:42] <%ggbhtg> LUL ggs
[2:31:43] <ManaSpurt> @floralkami lmao I know right
[2:31:46] <+loukemia83> monke top tier
[2:31:47] <+SenorCounter> SNL Mango
[2:31:50] <Super_Voltekka> MonkiFlip
[2:31:50] <jactuscack83> Durian is the only move he calls by its name
[2:31:58] <+NopeBadguy> DURIAN
[2:32:07] <KUYAmoPESh> Knuckledu
[2:32:13] <balthazar758> monke rules
[2:32:21] <dds333a> well...
[2:32:24] <ManaSpurt> I feel like the Durian should add a debuff on it.
[2:32:40] <PMda2nd> durian goes over
[2:32:45] <+BarbosaEdit> that was a JACA, not a durian
[2:32:47] <+thedream_c> ducklenu?
[2:32:54] <weapon000> @ManaSpurt like I said break it open for a poison dot
[2:33:08] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> haha game go brrrrr
[2:33:15] <+FuqBoiSlim> durian adds input lag to all your moves like that Valentine special
[2:33:22] <jactuscack83> Sexual Harassment..Panda
[2:33:24] <ManaSpurt> @ManaSpurt Yesss! Genius.
[2:33:41] <dds333a> I always thought it was kinda limiting
[2:33:51] <+thedream_c> its def toomuch conceptually since they never balanced around team mode
[2:33:54] <dds333a> But I like it still.
[2:34:07] <+thedream_c> remember old games did team battle mode despite balacning it around specifically for 1v1
[2:34:13] <+BarbosaEdit> no ratio system
[2:34:30] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> In a kof kinda way I still love this
[2:34:32] <%nicversus> Is Nuckledu doing ok? He was in an accident awhile back right
[2:34:42] <+thedream_c> that accident was awhile back
[2:35:08] <%nicversus> yeah I never really heard much after the initial thing
[2:35:26] <+thedream_c> i mean... check his twitter?
[2:35:28] <%nicversus> I think the drunken master design is the best one in the game for sure
[2:35:31] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> yo the setup
[2:35:33] <snowmanie> MvC2 tourneys using a set ratio system for characters are pretty interesting
[2:35:59] <+thedream_c> the neutral
[2:36:06] <+thedream_c> HIDDEN fireballz
[2:36:07] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> LITTLE?
[2:36:12] <DaKnightWarrior> Ryu & Ken helping.
[2:36:16] <PMda2nd> throws it before getting in the room
[2:36:17] <dds333a> Yep, they hitting too
