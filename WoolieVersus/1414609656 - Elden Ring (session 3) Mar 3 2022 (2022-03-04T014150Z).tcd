[0:01:42] <%Dapper_Cactuar> I had a Lyft driver in vegas who went on nonstop about a weed dispensary in the area and how I should go there the entire ride
[0:01:43] <MurseJOCO> Vegas is Sin city for a reason

[0:02:35] <%Dapper_Cactuar> @Shad0wTag no, was trying to get to a place for a post first day of EVO hangout
[0:02:40] <leith_aziz> My perspective is: sometimes, people need to vent their frustration, and I get it
[0:02:45] <@Solidus_113> read some frame data and call it important work info
[0:02:48] <%Shad0wTag> @WoolieVersus I have 2Mello on my phone and I HAVE to listen it taxi man
[0:02:56] <%Shad0wTag> @Dapper_Cactuar Good call
[0:02:58] <leith_aziz> I've done the same myself so I cant act innocent when venting
[0:03:02] <+LoveYouCuzDrunk> weather -> covid -> ww3, the natural escalation of a conversation

[0:05:24] <%espanishcanamurciana> Espanish caña Muricana / caña like the beer and Muricana like the region of murcia Spain @woolieversus
[0:05:26] <+Superbro64> @dsd24 back in my day, taking a picture of yourself and posting it online was unheard of
[0:05:29] <%Lion_kun> I am following 7 different playthroughs and still discovering new things
[0:05:39] <%hax_metatron> Wait, Woolie got caught by a chest?
[0:05:43] <%hax_metatron> It wasn't in the previous stream...
[0:05:46] <@Solidus_113> you should do the exploring first
[0:05:49] <crimsonharvest> @DSD24 i am applying the pain reliever and smoking weed about it
[0:05:49] <%DkLordG> I tried to complete the NW part of map and got eviscerated
[0:05:50] <yukichocomilk> I just kinda wander then come back to the main progress then wander so more etc
[0:05:50] <DSD24> @Superbro64 To be fair I'm not a social media guy myself
[0:05:51] <+eanscrale> This feels like the first real open world game
[0:05:58] <niddron> did the are first and then ended south doing that and after that doing stormveil, shits goods man
[0:06:00] <reasonance> which chest was it?
[0:06:02] <+Superbro64> @crimsonharvest bruh, how hard are you grippin that controller
[0:06:03] <linSP> In botw, I did all optional content before doing the first story quest or any of the big 4 dungeons
[0:06:04] <DSD24> @crimsonharvest I hope you feel better!
[0:06:04] <+Jiggisnipe> some people do the main quests, some people do side stuff for 100s of hours
[0:06:10] <+RealThiele> playstyle valid until some random mob one shots ya
[0:06:10] <sporeian94> I beat the game and missed half of the fucking game
[0:06:13] <oda_flobunaga> I'm 100 hours in and the game is still expanding
[0:06:25] <%funya_rinpa> lmao
[0:06:27] <%youngking_kush> Oh it's not just illusionary, there are like boarded up doors you have to break to find too

[0:06:30] <%RyTYoung> LUL
[0:06:30] <+Buttlo> @sporeian94 Only half? Damn you're a completionist.
[0:06:40] <niddron> @oda_flobunaga fuck that's crazy
[0:06:52] <+dougtert> i'm 95 hours in and truly feel like i'm barely half way done
[0:07:03] <+adamisbarely3d> hey gang, was putting up scaffolding, what did I miss
[0:07:04] <+FullMetalMonkey> I’m over 110 hours in and I’m still finding new stuff. I thought the game wasn’t as large as it is…. Oh how wrong I was
[0:07:05] <%espanishcanamurciana> Yeah, I made my twitch account when I lived there Murcia, Spain
[0:07:08] <%Reveresao> Yesterday, I found one of the areas shown in the loading screens, it was pretty dope.
[0:07:11] <peachy996> As a Canadian can you please apologize for "Canada Dry"
[0:07:12] <%RyTYoung> As long as Elden ring’s Z axis doesn’t go up into the SKY, I think my brain can handle it csbeastSetIn
[0:07:16] <oda_flobunaga> @niddron I have not unlocked the whole map yet
[0:07:17] <iacus_> it's pronounced like mur-zee-ana
[0:07:20] <+conqab> whoa

[0:07:33] <marvel877> NOOO
[0:07:34] <%CatRidder> its not an insult
[0:07:40] <%RyTYoung> @superbro64 You better be right dude
[0:07:40] <%espanishcanamurciana> Hahaha @catpurnicus
[0:07:42] <DSD24> The Dripless main characters
[0:07:42] <+Superbro64> From has some giant secret hiding in this game, I can feel it in me bones
[0:07:47] <+Nekros4442> they look like nerds
[0:07:52] <DSD24> Seriously the protags look so lame
[0:07:52] <%MajorCrasher> is there good beer out there that doesn't taste like crap?
[0:07:53] <thekeeva> weedcat

[0:08:02] <marvel877> Light spectrums
[0:08:05] <Zayasu> arceus is good despite its looks LUL
[0:08:09] <%shakespearo> @MajorCrasher it's called "cold beer" yeah
[0:08:10] <DSD24> I like the Fire Gator
[0:08:14] <niddron> @oda_flobunaga modder will be life "yeah but what if we add all the areas of the dark souls trilogy to make it bigger"
[0:08:18] <%espanishcanamurciana> @majorcrasher Not really I’m back home in the US and it’s much better
[0:08:48] <%holydeviant1> It's like hollow knight
[0:08:56] <@Solidus_113> 70 for me and just got MLGS
[0:09:09] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Expectations are EXCEEDED
[0:09:16] <+ReallyBigRocks> I'm almost 50 hours and I still haven't crafted :)
[0:09:20] <+Superbro64> elden ring taking so DAM LONG to come out actually makes sense
[0:09:24] <Who_lio42> i am zero hours in because im gonna cash it all in w Stranger of Paradise
[0:09:27] <yukichocomilk> this game is out of control and i love it so much LUL
[0:09:28] <%adamisbarely3d> oh no
[0:09:32] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[0:09:32] <branflayxes> I saw a guy go 20 hours before getting a second spell. lol
[0:09:36] <DSD24> @Who_lio42 I really hope that game is good
[0:09:38] <%adamisbarely3d> ILLUSORY FLOORS
[0:09:38] <+Superbro64> one of the few times something in development hell was totally worth it
[0:09:42] <velgaduere> ULTRA GOBLIN
[0:09:47] <+ReallyBigRocks> just let go, become one with the void
[0:09:49] <%holydeviant1> I've only found one phantasmal floor, folks
[0:09:49] <niddron> I'm only scared that I'll get overleed from all the exploration etc I'm doing
[0:09:59] <peachy996> This is a game where Goblins must die
[0:10:05] <+Jaromero435> The real Elden Ring was the illusory walls/floors we missed along the way
[0:10:10] <%SveriSageAdvice> pat found an illusory cliff face
[0:10:20] <%adamisbarely3d> @superbro64 I dunno if I'd call it dev hell, it seems like that's just how long it would take to create this much game
[0:10:24] <Who_lio42> @DSD24 same, i really liked Nioh 2 so im believing in it
[0:10:24] <jacknerik> mariaDub
[0:10:27] <%shakespearo> INTEGRITY \o/
[0:10:27] <+ReallyBigRocks> @niddron if you do, you'll stop being overleveled very quickly
[0:10:28] <%youngking_kush> @niddron Dont worry, the game will catch up eventually unless you purposefully grind
[0:10:28] <mikesapartment> cool! also sigh...
[0:10:29] <%funya_rinpa> Is there a company to drop
[0:10:29] <%livlinn> OhMyDog

[0:11:57] <+678saintglock> this is some of the best main menu music ever i swear
[0:11:57] <snapplejax> this game is crack and I don't even like souls games that much
[0:12:11] <Who_lio42> @DSD24 sweeet. i should check those out
[0:12:11] <NYCrownlessKing> hey GUYS AT NZXT. HOLLA AT YA BOI WOOLIE
[0:12:15] <%youngking_kush> @hax_metatron Same man same
[0:12:18] <%shakespearo> I played two hours of the game at work today, during a skype seminar
[0:12:19] <+GilroyGoldBlood> Reggie your hair is so good today
[0:12:24] <OblivionSword1> man I wish my laptop can run Elden Ring
[0:12:25] <kadulal> EldenBorne here we go!
[0:12:32] <velgaduere> @ComfyFox Elder Scrolls games are from here on AND retroactively known as "ring-likes"
[0:12:42] <+Ravenian96> The steam update sent my save file back 8 hours so I get to fight the final boss again :)
[0:12:44] <+lightbringrrrr> Reggie must suffer KPOPTT
[0:12:51] <snapplejax> THE GRACE
[0:12:52] <+FullMetalMonkey> The one thing that really scares me about this game is failing quests or getting different results… that’s gonna be a thing
[0:12:57] <%adamisbarely3d> check @demoneastaroth on twitter, they have a thread on the artisian builds situation
[0:12:58] <%shakespearo> @velgaduere ring-likes need good combat tho
[0:13:07] <heartlesshealer> Yeah reggie looks nice today while basking in the brilliance of the sun
[0:13:17] <%baka_sugoi> blessed by the ELDEN BLING
[0:13:17] <Johannen> When possible skip time to night when you can to find more unique encounters and you can counter strike from ranged attacks
[0:13:24] <SainEdge> holy Woolie AngelThump
[0:13:27] <velgaduere> @shakespearo not all Souls-likes do lobosKek
[0:13:42] <ComfyFox> LUL i was also thinking of sequals, how we gonna call them "ring games" (Like souls games before)
[0:13:47] <snapplejax> @velgaduere any one worth your time does
[0:13:54] <%livlinn> prenProm
[0:14:00] <%AngryAsian5> Time to Ring in some Eldens
[0:14:04] <+Catpurnicus> Uber is going to have to add a conversation option called "No Maidens" for Reggie
[0:14:07] <DosPalmas> anyone else in chat have the white screen crash issue with this game?
[0:14:12] <Louie_Salmon> @johannen They can also circle back for the night bosses, some are really tough
[0:14:14] <niddron> did they return to limgrave? that long elevator down was new for me so I left the stream then
[0:14:14] <%RemedyofRevenge> Warrior of Woolie! Ride NOOOWWWW
[0:14:17] <+ds3namecaldara> SeemsGood
[0:14:18] <%RyTYoung> THE LOATHSOME DUNG EATER
[0:14:20] <terpaderp> why does the startup music sound like it is dying
[0:14:22] <%shakespearo> @velgaduere compared to skyrim, yes LUL
[0:14:23] <velgaduere> @snapplejax sure, but that doesn't stop some with shitty combat from being called souls-like, so I don't see what's stopping ES games from being called ring-likes LUL
[0:14:26] <+AlucardX60> Whoa, new Eternal Ring game?
[0:14:38] <Johannen> @Louie_Salmon Yeah, but if you explore during day you wont know if something is there
[0:14:46] <+GilroyGoldBlood> @terpaderp try refreshing, it's a Twitch thing
[0:14:48] <+Catpurnicus> seems like every cabbie wants to tell him their old lady baggage
[0:14:49] <OblivionSword1> anything new
[0:14:54] <%shakespearo> Reminder that they wanted to call Dark Souls "Dark Ring" initially, but it means bumhole in bri'ish
[0:14:55] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> This is a good way to do this
[0:15:02] <DSD24> A lot of clean up in this game
[0:15:05] <Afrosamasenpai> recap episode lets go
[0:15:14] <heartlesshealer> Yeah, I suppose sync test would be after recap
[0:15:16] <DSD24> Nice hat btw Woolie
[0:15:24] <%adamisbarely3d> adamisbarely3d subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! Kick ass Woolsworth and Reggarth, hope you guys get a chance to put those co-op features to use somewhere down the line. Game looks amazing, glad you're having a great time with it
[0:15:25] <%shakespearo> oh this is a smart way to handle a game like this

[0:16:41] <mikesapartment> thats a rune drop buff i think
[0:16:42] <oda_flobunaga> exactly
[0:16:43] <%Lion_kun> That buffs your rune drop
[0:16:43] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus so when that weather effect happens, you gain bonus runes
[0:16:43] <+pupil31> AngelThump
[0:16:46] <crimsonharvest> in the intro voiceover it said like 'the falling leaves tell a tale' maybe its that
[0:16:46] <%hax_metatron> ERDTREE BUFF
[0:16:47] <FrostedZaibatsu> Yeah, i saw this and i stop. Its so beautiful
[0:16:48] <%shakespearo> iirc that weather has an effect too
[0:16:48] <%sirisvirus> it's a buff to rune gain
[0:16:48] <+dougtert> did you see that you got a buff during that?
[0:16:48] <iacus_> that gives a buff actually
[0:16:49] <+eanscrale> You get more runes apparently yeah
[0:16:51] <+Proxzo> Petals give you increased Runes from Kills
[0:16:53] <yukichocomilk> this game is so beautiful, even the gross areas are
[0:16:54] <Louie_Salmon> Various weather effects do things
[0:16:55] <+VictorVonLouche> boosts rune drops
[0:16:58] <%RyTYoung> Where is this!!??
[0:17:00] <+GilroyGoldBlood> Oh it's a rune buff? I thought it was health regen. Good to knoow
[0:17:02] <+FullMetalMonkey> Those petals give you more runes
[0:17:05] <%youngking_kush> The Erdtree petals apparently increase Rune & Item discovery. it's a buff
[0:17:08] <%RemedyofRevenge> @WoolieVersus if you look at your health bar, you have a buff from the petals
[0:17:15] <heartlesshealer> aoe burst summon
[0:17:17] <Dopamien> the horse stays ON
[0:17:24] <KingOfTheGeats> didn't know he could resummon his horse like you
[0:17:26] <+FullMetalMonkey> Weather has an effect. During rain lighting does more etc
[0:17:46] <snapplejax> Can't wait for the Moonveil discovery moment
[0:17:51] <+RealThiele> keep to the shield side of horseriders
[0:17:57] <@Solidus_113> yeah, rain increases lightning damage by 10% and drops fire damage by 10%

[0:18:11] <+GilroyGoldBlood> @Solidus_113 oh really? wow
[0:18:16] <+eanscrale> Their armor is SICK
[0:18:17] <yukichocomilk> @snapplejax I just got it Kreygasm
[0:18:17] <%adamisbarely3d> summoning another horse midfight feels like the same kind of "wait, that's no fair" thing as when ene
[0:18:21] <HelghastTroop> hey a shitty thing happened, my steam data fucked up and had to replay like ten hours of progress
[0:18:22] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:18:27] <%hax_metatron> It's a bff
[0:18:28] <snapplejax> @orochiblood Well I CAN wait I'm just saying Wools is gonna dig it
[0:18:34] <niddron> @fullmetalmonkey does the random lighting strikes near those cliffs with all the giants do something?
[0:18:46] <user_naim> Share button confirmed not cringe
[0:18:57] <crimsonharvest> did you get to try a weapon with a good R2 charge on horseback? the Flail stands out to me.
[0:19:09] <+ArmoredDeath> wait where is this boss at?
[0:19:16] <kadjah> Finish Him!
[0:19:17] <DSD24> I found a cool twinblade that has a great R2
[0:19:21] <%shakespearo> @ArmoredDeath they spawn at night at a couple spots
[0:19:21] <+GilroyGoldBlood> @ArmoredDeath nearly Gatefront ruins at night
[0:19:26] <FrostedZaibatsu> Get fucked
[0:19:27] <+StrawberryPantsu> Kirby demo is out.
[0:19:28] <LoneFonte> this is right next to the telescope
[0:19:33] <%youngking_kush> @armoreddeath The bridge near Gatedront Ruins at night
[0:19:34] <%Indigo_Automaton> It's so cool
[0:19:36] <DSD24> Eyy did you get Breakdown?
[0:19:39] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Million stab? I need to get that
[0:19:39] <Louie_Salmon> Million stab
[0:19:41] <+AutomatedSquid> why the window?
[0:19:49] <crimsonharvest> this is a clip is why
[0:19:50] <+RealThiele> R2 also has an active hurtbox as you windup

[0:19:56] <+ds3namecaldara> Dance Macabre
[0:19:57] <+MachoMadnesss94> What's up with the new layout?
[0:19:57] <%adamisbarely3d> they're watching a replay on the console
[0:19:57] <+GilroyGoldBlood> @AutomatedSquid this is a recap video of off stream stuff
[0:19:57] <%shakespearo> @AutomatedSquid it's a replay of what woolie did off-stream
[0:20:00] <+MachoMadnesss94> oh nvm
[0:20:09] <HelghastTroop> ah thats what it is
[0:20:19] <snapplejax> I love how the wild strikes skill is literally the SA wild swing from monster hunter
[0:20:30] <+RealThiele> bloodhound fang Kreygasm
[0:20:33] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> I'm 40 ish hours in and still using this boss's curved sword, it's really good
[0:20:36] <HelghastTroop> bloodhound gets schooled with jump attacks\
[0:20:36] <%Lion_kun> I wish the fast forward in the ps5 archives are faster
[0:20:45] <HelghastTroop> all the sweeps get wiff'd
[0:20:47] <+pupil31> Glintblade is S Tier
[0:20:48] <+mechslayer71> oh woolie, if only you knew
[0:20:50] <DSD24> His bleed damage hurts a ton
[0:20:59] <%Lion_kun> It is a pain when trimming videos
[0:21:05] <+GilroyGoldBlood> bleed in this game is so busted, it's crazy
[0:21:14] <+RealThiele> bleed and rot are nuts
[0:21:24] <FrostedZaibatsu> That weapon is good on bleed
[0:21:25] <%youngking_kush> I used his sword for like my first 40hours of the game, so good lol
[0:21:26] <+pupil31> I did 17k damage to a big enemy with +3 claws LUL
[0:21:30] <+GilroyGoldBlood> it just destroys bosses
[0:21:31] <%khalcipher> oh no
[0:21:38] <oda_flobunaga> For the record, as good as bleed is in ER, it is not as busted as it is in DS3.
[0:21:43] <%khalcipher> he killed Darrwil?
[0:21:45] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[0:21:47] <jacknerik> Can you parry enemies that are mid jump?
[0:21:50] <+FullMetalMonkey> Bloodknight reminds me of the Dancer in DS3
[0:21:57] <%Raios22> Raios22 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! 
[0:22:08] <snapplejax> DEX great sword!
[0:22:08] <%sssoapy> lol
[0:22:13] <stormhawk9891> A REALLY good sword
[0:22:14] <snapplejax> Brb killing this guy
[0:22:15] <+thefancywig> that weapon fucking rules
[0:22:20] <HelghastTroop> pretty much the wolf curved sword from ds3
[0:22:21] <+pupil31> More bleed
[0:22:28] <jacknerik> Got DAMN
[0:22:28] <%youngking_kush> The Ashe of War is VERY strong
[0:22:30] <%AlteisenReiseZ> IT'S SO GOOD
[0:22:31] <+GilroyGoldBlood> There's more to the art if you have the stats
[0:22:33] <OblivionSword1> damn
[0:22:33] <heartlesshealer> love the cute little worm dudes
[0:22:36] <%youngking_kush> BIG stance damage
[0:22:38] <+ds3namecaldara> I literally found the new Pontiff knights. Thanks Miazaki I hate them
[0:22:39] <+thefancywig> with FP it's EVEN BETTER
[0:22:41] <%RyTYoung> That’s my main weapon woolieGASM woolieGASM woolieGASM
[0:22:42] <+RealThiele> the weapon art swipe/backstep is so good
[0:22:44] <+Jaromero435> With the stats/fp you go invisible
[0:22:45] <@Solidus_113> it's less damaage
[0:22:51] <%hax_metatron> Slightly less damage, but still great.
[0:22:58] <RedBlossomail> the follow up has iframes when you have fp btw
[0:22:58] <+GilroyGoldBlood> It's way cooler with the stats
[0:23:10] <%Lion_kun> Dex has heavy support at the start
[0:23:12] <%hax_metatron> It's a buff!!!
[0:23:12] <+10mPerSecond> love these in depth looks at these fights from woolie and reggie, thanks guys
[0:23:12] <+GilroyGoldBlood> These pettles increase Rune drops
[0:23:14] <+RealThiele> 40 dex gang
[0:23:14] <+eanscrale> dex improves casting speed as well
[0:23:15] <snapplejax> This game is so pretty to idle in
[0:23:17] <%Charronia> limesOmg
[0:23:17] <oda_flobunaga> There are really good Strength int swords so...
[0:23:18] <%hax_metatron> Look at your character
[0:23:21] <%hax_metatron> She has a buff
[0:23:23] <snapplejax> I find myself screenshotting so often
[0:23:24] <+GilroyGoldBlood> You have a buff
[0:23:24] <kulmoth> don't forget dex improves spellcasting speed
[0:23:28] <%Reveresao> @WoolieVersus You get a buff from it
[0:23:29] <%ozzrabbit> With FP it causes you to teleport
[0:23:29] <+eanscrale> Tell EVERYONE you leveled that shit up
[0:23:30] <+xiccy> Dex is better than Str for a good chunk of the game
[0:23:30] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus so when that weather effect happens, you gain bonus runes and item drops rates
[0:23:35] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> IZELDRAKE IS SO REAL
[0:23:36] <%Lion_kun> But do not abandon the path of strength/int
[0:23:37] <heartlesshealer> go talk to drizzt
[0:23:41] <crimsonharvest> consume the thrice-chewed jellybean
[0:23:42] <DSD24> I like being Quality
[0:23:46] <%RemedyofRevenge> Liam Oneesan of Limgrave
[0:23:47] <%shakespearo> On the night of the petal rain, talk to Scrumblo the Misbegotten at Brumblo Church
[0:23:48] <NYCrownlessKing> DUNG SLINGER
[0:23:54] <jacknerik> PogChamp
[0:23:57] <+pupil31> You earned it my g
[0:23:58] <+Catpurnicus> apparently it buffs you too?
[0:24:01] <NYCrownlessKing> ooooo
[0:24:04] <KingOfTheGeats> I guess that's an incentive to wander at night
[0:24:07] <NYCrownlessKing> I didn't know
[0:24:08] <SainEdge> wait, really?!?
[0:24:08] <%Xelhesia> woolie gonna want that moonveil blsde
[0:24:17] <HelghastTroop> oh the weather does that
[0:24:19] <stormhawk9891> So has anyone managed to beat Glaive Knight Hodir yet?
[0:24:19] <+RealThiele> this + chickenfoot buff
[0:24:26] <%Lion_kun> Also did you know when it's raining, enemies take 10% less fire damage and 10% more lightning damage.
[0:24:29] <HelghastTroop> i was wondering how i got that buff from random
[0:24:30] <FrostedZaibatsu> Damn. Imagine missing out on playing this game
[0:24:31] <+thedream_c> another Maidenless stream
[0:24:38] <Dopamien> oh yea looks like you have a buff on
[0:24:46] <+ArmoredDeath> @lion_kun hggShaq
[0:24:59] <snapplejax> I swear the repack of this game runs better than the legit copy
[0:25:04] <zenith0111> The fan can be heard a lot
[0:25:06] <+FullMetalMonkey> I wonder if the petal drops has something to do with people becoming Elden lord? Like the bell towers in DS1
[0:25:13] <crimsonharvest> god damnit i was lifting the piece to my mouth and the door knocked
[0:25:16] <%therustystream> oh cool offstream recap
[0:25:21] <%therustystream> good idea
[0:25:22] <+RealThiele> @snapplejax anti-cheat is likely causing huge problems as always
[0:25:22] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:25:45] <niddron> DOSHO DOSHO!
[0:25:46] <%ozzrabbit> Did Woolie hear the howl in the Mistwood?
[0:25:46] <stormhawk9891> DOSHO DOSHO!
[0:25:49] <+GilroyGoldBlood> 60 hours in and I only just found my first Ash of War for a bow
[0:25:50] <snapplejax> @snapplejax I loved MHW but never played Iceborne over that shit ;-;
[0:25:56] <xxHungryxx> Using bows can actually be viable in this souls game. especially jumping attack with them @woolieversus
[0:26:09] <%CatRidder> Woolie stares at Woolie VS
[0:26:11] <+Catpurnicus> is this still busted on PC?
[0:26:14] <chowndawg> jump shots and rolling shots come out quickly
[0:26:17] <crimsonharvest> the hand axe was very MVP in DS1
[0:26:17] <%youngking_kush> I'm totally plotting an Archer build playthrough after my initial one
[0:26:18] <zenith0111> Weapons still have whiff recovery right
[0:26:22] <+GilroyGoldBlood> @youngking_kush same
[0:26:22] <zenith0111> ?
[0:26:27] <+RealThiele> PC most recent patch id say makes it playable if you beat recommended specs
[0:26:41] <snapplejax> @GilroyGoldBlood Yeah 30 hours in and no sight of one. Sounds about righjt
[0:26:43] <Dopamien> @Catpurnicus depends entirely on pc
[0:26:50] <+thedream_c> reccomended specs beyond GTX 1060
[0:26:56] <DSD24> Oh its the Demi Humans
[0:26:56] <+Huttersson> Might be useful for poison swamps
[0:27:11] <+Huttersson> If the same trick from DS3 still works
[0:27:25] <%youngking_kush> @gilroygoldblood Idk if you played Dragon's Dogma but you can totally recreate the Magick Archer from that in ER I feel like
[0:27:34] <+Catpurnicus> 8600 and a 3070?
[0:27:35] <kadjah> bear cracked back
[0:27:35] <nintega010> God of war ruined axe weapons for me
[0:27:37] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> the bear is serious
[0:27:38] <+GilroyGoldBlood> @youngking_kush oh hell yeah
[0:27:39] <ExpressNode> Just got back from a short day at work
[0:27:40] <zenith0111> @huttersson Literally dont bother because the horse does it already
[0:27:47] <+thedream_c> boo boo the average bear
[0:27:51] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[0:27:53] <+RealThiele> bear does not fucka round

[0:28:00] <zenith0111> YOU DIED
[0:28:06] <%shakespearo> bear heard you talking shit from across the street
[0:28:09] <+thedream_c> Yogi is the cave though is crazier tho
[0:28:11] <Paperware> @DSD24 More like Bloodstained Bears
[0:28:12] <FrostedZaibatsu> The bears are just the gorillas in Sekiro. Some of the same animations
[0:28:17] <HelghastTroop> roars that cut the air and your jugular
[0:28:19] <kikoeru_san> dova-bear
[0:28:22] <velgaduere> @DSD24 oh god they dropped an N now too?! doodTerror
[0:28:23] <%youngking_kush> Bro I still cant fuck with those bears
[0:28:28] <%Dapper_Cactuar> can we have one RPG where bears aren't terrifying
[0:28:28] <+GilroyGoldBlood> 1 min down, 1 min up
[0:28:29] <Dopamien> lmao I've never done that
[0:28:30] <%Lion_kun> I could teleport out
[0:28:30] <+RealThiele> river :o
[0:28:32] <%Dcapit8ed> (you can quit out lol)
[0:28:33] <%youngking_kush> You gotta respect them
[0:28:33] <+Kawaso> LUL
[0:28:35] <snapplejax> @DSD24 Bloodsteined Bears
[0:28:44] <mental_mashup> I thought the bear was a boss until I saw another one like 20 feet away LUL
[0:28:52] <crimsonharvest> there's an elevator similar to that that I found the scariest thing
[0:28:59] <cj_art> how many all star battles can you fit in there tho
[0:29:05] <+Doctor_Irony> you can actually just sit at the grace site and it will skip the wait for it to come dow.
[0:29:05] <DSD24> This is some Condemned 2 Bear shit
[0:29:07] <reasonance> @crimsonharvest ainsel?
[0:29:07] <zenith0111> Bears are canines LUL
[0:29:09] <LimitBreak_J> @FrostedZaibatsu bears are just gorillas on all wheel drive
[0:29:17] <%Seancicle> 👋🏻🤞🏻
[0:29:21] <+GilroyGoldBlood> @LimitBreak_J lmao
[0:29:22] <+pupil31> Bear vs wolves Pog
[0:29:24] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[0:29:27] <niddron> ok why can I sometimes summon but other times not? haven't figured that out
[0:29:28] <%AlteisenReiseZ> YA EVER SEE ME FIGHTING IN THE FOREST WITH A GIRZZLY BEAR, HELP THE BEAR
[0:29:31] <%andre11dr> Wow ,what's happening?
[0:29:32] <athuramn> @limitbreak_j goddammit that's so accurate KEKW
[0:29:36] <ExpressNode> What type of build is he running?
[0:29:43] <DSD24> @niddron You gotta look for the grave icon on the left side of the screen
[0:29:46] <%shakespearo> @niddron the spirits? it's limited to certain areas
[0:29:47] <%andre11dr> Oh i guess this is offscreen play?
[0:29:49] <%holydeviant1> @niddron Some places allow it, but not others.
[0:29:56] <+redhandedbee> But mr bear I just wanna snug
[0:29:57] <+thedream_c> ol kite aggro technique
[0:29:57] <+solzan2000> lol
[0:29:59] <%ozzrabbit> …he must have heard the howls. I hope he asked the Santa merchant about them.
[0:29:59] <%Pillagius> this guy fighting you with his bear hands!
[0:30:04] <zenith0111> @niddron The games tutorial prompt shows you that you need to be near a Summoning Stone indicated by a Gravestone Icon
[0:30:06] <niddron> aah thanks guys!
[0:30:07] <+pupil31> Poor boy :(
[0:30:07] <%hax_metatron> Man upgrading spirits was such a great feature they added.  This really is the best Pokemon game.
[0:30:08] <%youngking_kush> The bears here arent as strong as some of the ones you'll encounter later
[0:30:08] <+GilroyGoldBlood> @andre11dr yeah, doing catchup on a few off screen things
[0:30:09] <DSD24> Bear Necessities
[0:30:17] <snapplejax> @ExpressNode Dex int it seems
[0:30:37] <kadjah> put the bear rug in front of the fire
[0:30:39] <+GilroyGoldBlood> Crafting item! Woo!
[0:30:40] <%CatRidder> bloodborne
[0:30:40] <%Cherokia666> bluud
[0:30:42] <+Jiggisnipe> he's str int I believe
[0:30:44] <+eanscrale> Fear the old blood
[0:30:45] <%andre11dr> Fear it
[0:30:45] <%Seancicle> desolons 😅
[0:30:46] <crimsonharvest> turns out its just a bear
[0:30:48] <HelghastTroop> whats that smell..
[0:30:53] <+redhandedbee> Beet blood
[0:31:02] <+RealThiele> regular-ass enemy
[0:31:12] <%Reveresao> Summon flashing like that means that you are the edge of the area where they are allowed
[0:31:15] <FrostedZaibatsu> You wanted the Bear Ruler Sword or something LUL
[0:31:16] <+robertoszek> not really
[0:31:18] <nintega010> they balanced this game around these summons
[0:31:21] <+GilroyGoldBlood> didn't follow the fella
[0:31:22] <+thedream_c> man the messages smoetimes area  hoot
[0:31:25] <%khalcipher> idk whta that tree is yet
[0:31:27] <@Menitta> more like smelden ring lmao gottem
[0:31:28] <%CatRidder> but can you pet the bear
[0:31:28] <+Flunkorg> omg did woolie just assume that was a player thing?
[0:31:31] <Louie_Salmon> Oh that's not exactly what happened there
[0:31:33] <niddron> wait yeah that summons a Nov ghost that you follow
[0:31:34] <kikoeru_san> @nintega010 no they did not
[0:31:38] <haitakaa> LUL
[0:31:40] <+Jaromero435> That tree is totally not player made
[0:31:43] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Its not a message tree, its a special game tree
[0:31:43] <oda_flobunaga> @WoolieVersus That is not a message with a tree.  You need to interact with that tree
[0:31:45] <kikoeru_san> there are summons in this game that are BUSTED
[0:31:56] <mental_mashup> The tree shows you were a dungeon is located
[0:31:57] <zenith0111> @kikoeru_san They did. They die very very fast even at max level
[0:32:07] <+thedream_c> ghastly shopkeep?
[0:32:07] <mental_mashup> Wjere*
[0:32:09] <haitakaa> yeah the tree is independent of the message
[0:32:09] <+BananaSlammuh> @WoolieVersus The tree spawns a ghost that leads you somewhere. IN that footage you can see it just spawn
[0:32:10] <zenith0111> Summons are busted for the early zone. thats it
[0:32:13] <kikoeru_san> @zenith0111 clearly you haven't gotten the mimic
[0:32:15] <+Arnoldoaad1> lord kenneth BibleThump
[0:32:22] <OblivionSword1> Lord Kenny LUL
[0:32:22] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:32:27] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> oh...that ghost was talking about THAT. huh
[0:32:28] <+RealThiele> always be buyin' stonesword keys
[0:32:34] <+ds3namecaldara> If You beat a main boss and see the message "Lovable sort ahead, and likely Necessary item ahead "
[0:32:36] <@Menitta> oooh this is the off stream footage
[0:32:42] <+robertoszek> the message was on top of the tree
[0:32:46] <%andre11dr> Lord Kenneth of the five times
[0:32:46] <+Flunkorg> Guess how I know you missed out on spirit tunning? lol
[0:32:46] <FrostedZaibatsu> Illusory tree?
[0:32:52] <zenith0111> @kikoeru_san Still not that good for the fights especially the ones im thinking of
[0:32:53] <user_naim> you saw a ghost walk of screen
[0:32:54] <niddron> @realthiele are all stonesword key gates worth it?
[0:32:56] <+thedream_c> "Liar ahead" in front of a wall
[0:32:58] <%Reveresao> @WoolieVersus  The tree is like the statues that led you somewhere.
[0:33:02] <+RealThiele> @niddron yes
[0:33:02] <nintega010> kenny
[0:33:15] <zenith0111> @kikoeru_san Some of the hardest encounters straight up dont have summoning stones
[0:33:16] <+thedream_c> park ranger woolie on patrol
[0:33:21] <niddron> @realthiele thanks
[0:33:23] <%funya_rinpa> How didn't he notice the random ass ghost spawning in, lol
[0:33:25] <+CrystalTree07> the tree summons a ghost that you follow to points of interest
[0:33:26] <peachy996> How many sessions have been done so far
[0:33:27] <%Reveresao> Summon flashing like that means that you are the edge of the area where they are allowed @WoolieVersus
[0:33:28] <agustorm123> Snail power
[0:33:30] <@Menitta> if I ever see a real illusion wall, I'm going to put "liar ahead"
[0:33:30] <@Solidus_113> zone out of the aera\
[0:33:31] <+GilroyGoldBlood> There was no summon pool thingy near there I guess
[0:33:32] <+ds3namecaldara> I've yet to see a Key use that wasn't worth
[0:33:36] <NeonBleu> They said fuck that
[0:33:45] <+Arnoldoaad1> it was out of the summoning area, unlucky
[0:33:47] <+RealThiele> union rules said break time
[0:33:52] <%shakespearo> @Menitta yomi is the japanese word for reading the mind of the opponent
[0:33:55] <%Lion_kun> I found my first illusion wall yesterday
[0:33:58] <kikoeru_san> @zenith0111 then they didn't balance the game around summons lol, thanks, that's what I had said already
[0:34:08] <@Menitta> LUL
[0:34:09] <+redhandedbee> You sliced his butt right off
[0:34:15] <+orochiblood> ~ahhhhhh
[0:34:17] <+thedream_c> i didn't know illusory floors are in the game too
[0:34:22] <@Menitta> Yeah those bears fuck you up
[0:34:23] <+thedream_c> in the oddest of places too
[0:34:30] <%youngking_kush> @kikoeru_san They definitely balanced the game around you having summons, 100%
[0:34:32] <haitakaa> just scratchin
[0:34:32] <%Reveresao> Supposedly there is a slime summon that destroy bosses @kikoeru_san
[0:34:34] <%Seancicle> mangér mangér 👌🏻
[0:34:35] <zenith0111> @kikoeru_san You beating the game is balanced
[0:34:41] <@Menitta> that forest has a fuckload of them
[0:34:45] <+thedream_c> yeah they def promote using summons
[0:34:47] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Same with Statues of Marika, they have a unique zone tied to them to make repeated attempts of bosses easier
[0:34:48] <%youngking_kush> That's why you cant just use them all the time
[0:34:48] <agustorm123> Bubu is just like who cares
[0:35:02] <@Solidus_113> there's one near the ghost NPC, in the direction he's facing
[0:35:06] <DSD24> Pollinate this asshole
[0:35:10] <@Menitta> those flowers are assholes
[0:35:14] <+RealThiele> plants :E
[0:35:15] <+Arnoldoaad1> Btw im watching Pat's streams and someone pointed something about the bears that i didnt notice, they are Vorch, the first boss on DS3
[0:35:16] <%Lion_kun> Summons are not encouraged, they are required
[0:35:20] <%JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[0:35:26] <+Jaromero435> also L1 lets you swing on the left side of your horse
[0:35:27] <Plughead_> why the big border?
[0:35:32] <%Lion_kun> Bosses hit for tons of damage
[0:35:37] <KAINONAUT> +maidenless
[0:35:39] <%Lion_kun> You need a tank
[0:35:40] <+thedream_c> death and nature
[0:35:43] <+pupil31> Death of the wild
[0:35:44] <%shakespearo> @Arnoldoaad1 the large dudes that pull the carriages also likewise share some moves with the monkey from sekiro
[0:35:49] <DSD24> Boney Boys
[0:35:52] <jacknerik> @Plughead_ This is a replay of what he did off stream
[0:35:55] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @Plughead_ it's a video from Woolie playing solo
[0:35:55] <crimsonharvest> shouldnta come here, maidenless
[0:35:57] <@Menitta> I beat the first boss before getting the summon bell which probably would've been helpful
[0:36:00] <+RealThiele> nature zombies
[0:36:05] <%youngking_kush> @lion_kun Not even that, I fought a boss that had like 10 dudes with him
[0:36:10] <user_naim> ”Nature is a cantankerous bitch drunk on power”
[0:36:19] <DSD24> You made a grave mistake
[0:36:24] <%Lion_kun> The game loves its duo bosses too
[0:36:28] <zenith0111> @kikoeru_san Maybe buy the game 1st
[0:36:29] <haitakaa> yeah you can swing on the left side with L1
[0:36:36] <+itslunchie> @Menitta oh yeah, i summoned wolves, the wizard and just spammed rock fling and just cleaned margit out
[0:36:51] <+thedream_c> its like social media
[0:36:56] <+thedream_c> if you engage, the enemies engage back
[0:37:00] <+Arnoldoaad1> @Arnoldoaad1 Yeah, there are a lot of enemy reuses but the did a great job on not making it obvious, I didnt notice the bear until it was ointed to me
[0:37:16] <niddron> enemies that stop following you was such a staple, it's kinda weird it's gone. But it's good
[0:37:27] <@Menitta> enemies on top of higher ground REALLY fuck you up because they only travel horizontally so you're distance gauging is not accurate
[0:37:34] <@Menitta> at least from my own experience lol
[0:37:37] <FrostedZaibatsu> I ran away from an enemy for a bout 30 seconds and it was still on my ass. They thugs out here
[0:37:39] <+RealThiele> the horse L/R combat felt weird at first
[0:37:46] <%Seancicle> 🤨❓
[0:38:00] <+AugiJr> skill issue :)
[0:38:19] <+thedream_c> a twig
[0:38:22] <%hax_metatron> Talisman
[0:38:26] <%Reveresao> talisman
[0:38:29] <+Arnoldoaad1> It is a talisman
[0:38:29] <oda_flobunaga> It is a talisman
[0:38:32] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Talisman, same as sacrifice rings
[0:38:34] <xxHungryxx> I wonder if Woolie has gotten any new spells?
[0:38:34] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> wonder if we'll get to Margit today since it's a double session...though, there's quite a bit to Limgrave
[0:38:44] <+pupil31> mama plant
[0:38:46] <+Jaromero435> big fucker
[0:38:58] <+thedream_c> Solar beam
[0:39:00] <+Proxzo> Solar Beam
[0:39:03] <@Menitta> the fuck you plant
[0:39:05] <+Proxzo> Venusaur
[0:39:06] <+daemonazaezal> CASTS HOLY
[0:39:07] <agustorm123> Founding all those ashes are like pokemon I gotta cash em all
[0:39:08] <velgaduere> basically solar beam yeah lmao
[0:39:10] <+daemonazaezal> not lightning
[0:39:13] <%Lion_kun> Light attack not lightning
[0:39:14] <+thedream_c> chlorphyll? more like BOREaphyll
[0:39:14] <NeonBleu> evolution is aazing
[0:39:15] <+solzan2000> I finally beat tree sentinel then beat margit in 4 turns today lol
[0:39:15] <+pupil31> Venusaur use Solar Beam
[0:39:17] <niddron> for plants I recommend using a torch as a weapon
[0:39:17] <DatonKallandor> oh dang is this live?
[0:39:19] <%shakespearo> plant got anti-vegan-rays
[0:39:22] <%Lion_kun> It does holy damage
[0:39:22] <+Bailey__Gaming> I like to throw fireballs at these
[0:39:23] <+CrystalTree07> solar beam
[0:39:23] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1498566821108228097?s=20&t=pXnUDOSgpoKV-ebdFPvSIg
[0:39:24] <+RealThiele> blue plants :(
[0:39:30] <+daemonazaezal> its using Lvl 9 Holy
[0:39:49] <user_naim> I really like the new cloud effects for poison and stuff
[0:40:01] <user_naim> looks really pretty
[0:40:02] <+thedream_c> oh interseting downwind interaction
[0:40:03] <chowndawg> plants seem to be holy in elden ring
[0:40:06] <FrostedZaibatsu> Its the move from DS3 DLC, which i just got finish playing before this game. "i know what this is... run!" -Me
[0:40:07] <+Bailey__Gaming> I also very much enjoy the crafting, ive so many plants i never run out
[0:40:09] <niddron> @daemonazaezal plant comprehend the concept of divinity!?
[0:40:13] <+sevorai> Reggie not a fan of squiters?
[0:40:13] <+daemonazaezal> remember in the lands between PLANTS are SACRED so they cast holy
[0:40:19] <%Lion_kun> These recap streams are chill
[0:40:26] <AsleepAura> Big hay fever
[0:40:32] <zenith0111> Plants are the first ancient life
[0:40:36] <Johannen> cowardice
[0:40:45] <+daemonazaezal> Praise Tree!
[0:41:07] <%Xelhesia> poison isnt that bad this time thankfully
[0:41:08] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> the anti-poison is incredibly easy to craft so getting poisoned is not that much of a big deal thankfully
[0:41:08] <moonmintparadise> so is this all still pre-rec or is he playing ?
[0:41:09] <+RealThiele> poison damage is worse than normal souls but its no toxic
[0:41:13] <%Lion_kun> It stays a while but it's not so bad with the estus refill mechanic
[0:41:16] <+sevorai> I found that fire stuns those plants but i haven't found something that does real damage to em
[0:41:25] <+Azathotic> Thats cause theres a new toxic
[0:41:30] <%Lion_kun> There is a toxic, it's called scarlet rot
[0:41:33] <+RealThiele> yea rot is fucked
[0:41:39] <zenith0111> You can get DOUBLE POISONED
[0:41:48] <%andre11dr> Dude I'm like 35 hours deep and i still haven't fought Margret
[0:41:52] <%Lion_kun> Eh I expected worse from rot
[0:41:52] <oda_flobunaga> Ther is also a new curse, called death blight
[0:41:54] <%pauperofthesouth> oh nice you got some decent armor now
[0:41:56] <user_naim> shh, scarlet rot is nothing to worry about
[0:42:11] <%andre11dr> I should probably just start with that the next time I play
[0:42:19] <+solzan2000> margit is a funny boss, hes both hard and easy to defeat
[0:42:25] <zenith0111> @andre11dr Thats most likely the intended way tbh
[0:42:45] <+ds3namecaldara> Miazaki said be Excited for it so I am
[0:42:51] <user_naim> good call woolie
[0:42:55] <Dopamien> my itch is a rash at this point
[0:42:56] <%andre11dr> @zenith0111 I finished the whole red zone and still haven't done the first boss LUL
[0:42:58] <oda_flobunaga> There is a rapier that starts with Rot on it that can get poison placed on it as well
[0:43:03] <+OrangeMDT> Hopefully it’s not a big spoiler but a lot of the graces are near main roads
[0:43:06] <zenith0111> There's a lot of points in the main path where they go "Explore the Map idiot"
[0:43:08] <+sevorai> JUDGEMENT CUUUUTS
[0:43:09] <%hax_metatron> RESPEC 100 times
[0:43:09] <Treasure_Vault> What, Woolie isn't spending all his off-stream hours in the VELDT?
[0:43:09] <+Jaromero435> very cool dex things
[0:43:10] <%ozzrabbit> …I probably sound like a broken record right now, but I REALLY hope Woolie heard the howling, and asks Santa about it.
[0:43:11] <%pauperofthesouth> has anyone used the telescope? I haven't bought it
[0:43:11] <%Lion_kun> Stay strong woolie
[0:43:13] <+sevorai> SUMMON SWOOOOOORDS
[0:43:14] <velgaduere> there's a WILD amount of dex stuff happening
[0:43:14] <%hax_metatron> Do all builds, just RESPEC
[0:43:17] <+Grayhammatter> dex/int let's go
[0:43:18] <%khalcipher> There is cool everything tho
[0:43:21] <xxHungryxx> Margit is a test boss to see if the player has learned mechanics
[0:43:22] <%Lion_kun> STR/INT ALL THE WAY
[0:43:24] <IzanagiNoOokami> There's some cool things in every direction.
[0:43:25] <%Xelhesia> Moonveil
[0:43:26] <%Reveresao> Really got to a get new helmet that thing is heavy
[0:43:26] <+Nekros4442> you generally want to go dex with an int caster
[0:43:30] <@Solidus_113> my tweet perhaps? Kappa
[0:43:31] <+678saintglock> become vergil
[0:43:33] <+daemonazaezal> That twinblade build tho
[0:43:42] <%Pillagius> Dex is nice. Got 3 katanas and they performing great
[0:43:42] <%Lion_kun> Do not be tempted by these vile dex heathens
[0:43:43] <@Menitta> Knives are great for stealth backstabs with crit damage at the very least
[0:43:43] <CatsDrunkonCopper> dex shortens spell casting
[0:43:47] <+solzan2000> yea dex is great for int caster
[0:43:49] <user_naim> storm approaching huh?
[0:43:53] <+solzan2000> very important
[0:44:02] <%hax_metatron> Just go quality and use all the dex weapons you need, put quality scaling on them
[0:44:02] <Johannen> winds are howling
[0:44:02] <+sevorai> Reduvia dagger is fucking GROSS, still using it 40 hours in
[0:44:02] <@Menitta> Ooooh yeah that Tweet
[0:44:03] <%pauperofthesouth> oh that's what I'm currently using
[0:44:12] <%Deasmeister> and only three dex points needed
[0:44:31] <zenith0111> @sevorai Luckily in pvp its not that scary moveset wise
[0:44:33] <+Axellogic> woolie will want dex into
[0:44:35] <%ozzrabbit> You guys forgetting about the Str/Int colossal sword?
[0:44:39] <+RealThiele> help me step-attack
[0:44:43] <xxHungryxx> It's weapon skill I like a lot
[0:44:44] <@Menitta> I'm debating dipping into bloodloss
[0:44:51] <+hoenhime344> everyonde and their mother use this sword....
[0:44:52] <user_naim> @realthiele NotLikeThis
[0:44:54] <huskarl_zap> the first time unsure build curse hits
[0:44:54] <+RealThiele> bleed is ridiculous
[0:44:55] <robobeau> The bleed effect on this sword is pretty good
[0:44:55] <%edgeroth> there some crazy strength weapons in this game as eell
[0:44:57] <%pauperofthesouth> @ozzrabbit is that the Guts sword?
[0:44:58] <@Solidus_113> that is not Quality, it's pretty minimum for requirements
[0:44:58] <+thedream_c> def can/will happen
[0:45:00] <+daemonazaezal> bloodloss works great on bosses
[0:45:05] <agustorm123> Dex LUL
[0:45:09] <Johannen> Woolie chasing all the tails
[0:45:11] <+thedream_c> therea re many dex items
[0:45:18] <+RealThiele> for woolie respec at 60 hours in
[0:45:30] <%Lion_kun> You can respec
[0:45:31] <nintega010> the sword that looks like guts sword is awesome
[0:45:32] <@Solidus_113> Woolie you're at the start of an 80 hour game, don't fear building now
[0:45:36] <+sevorai> Bloodlossing bosses is a really nice feeling
[0:45:38] <Dopamien> woolie proud of his 'try pickle' message Kappa
[0:45:39] <zenith0111> There's multiple ways to respec. Which is weird
[0:45:40] <%andre11dr> Well we do know that the moonlight sword is in this, i don't know if it's a strength sword or not
[0:45:50] <+FZeroDMX> This game has a wild amount of cool weapons
[0:45:50] <%whyskeywolfe> The Implication
[0:45:51] <@Menitta> I've just been dumping into Faith. Faith/strength so far is really versitile
[0:45:51] <+thedream_c> big maps, big dreams
[0:45:53] <%ozzrabbit> @pauperofthesouth no, the Guts Sword is also in the game. There is another one in Caria Manor that’s dropped by the Troll
[0:45:53] <huskarl_zap> the dex users usually need a Chad for back up most times
[0:45:54] <%andre11dr> I haven't seen it yet
[0:45:57] <%hax_metatron> Do whatever you want -- this game makes most things possible
[0:46:00] <jacknerik> @Solidus_113 80 hours? someone's a speedrunner.
[0:46:01] <%pauperofthesouth> @nintega010 I have it but I can't wield it effectly yet FeelsBadMan
[0:46:02] <DSD24> Fait and Strength is super cool
[0:46:03] <+RealThiele> do NOT neglect vigor either game expects you to have some
[0:46:04] <+StryderStrikesAt> MOTIVATED
[0:46:05] <%funya_rinpa> Woolie realizing why half the community always goes quality first time
[0:46:06] <%hax_metatron> The first video game where literally: DO WHATEVER
[0:46:09] <iacus_> nice
[0:46:09] <wandelmilch> Take a couple of swings at the weapons, if you iwll
[0:46:12] <%Deasmeister> Dex speeds up casts too so works well for casters
[0:46:16] <@Menitta> There are some really good incantations
[0:46:17] <+MooseIsGoose> You should be able to see the move set without the stats
[0:46:21] <zenith0111> Quality Build build for life
[0:46:22] <+sevorai> my vigor is definitely lacking atm
[0:46:22] <iacus_> i'ts not a bad sword for str+dex
[0:46:25] <Louie_Salmon> We all know where this is going, how could we ever not become vergil
[0:46:25] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:46:25] <%pauperofthesouth> @ozzrabbit Ah ok. Thanks
[0:46:26] <DSD24> That's why I went Wretch cause I wanted to start completely with nothing
[0:46:27] <+CrystalTree07> even if you go strength getting DeX to atleast 18-20 opens up a lot
[0:46:28] <%Lion_kun> You can pump some dex, it will still serve the magicnknight build
[0:46:29] <%edgeroth> oh yeah leveling vigor is definitely a must
[0:46:42] <+thedream_c> Woolie aims to become Vergil after all ;)
[0:46:48] <+sevorai> MILLION STABS
[0:46:55] <@Menitta> I found a VERY cool faith weapon that only does holy damage. I need to get my faith up FAST.
[0:47:00] <%andre11dr> This is a great one
[0:47:00] <+thedream_c> rapier types
[0:47:02] <OblivionSword1> Colossal weapons ?
[0:47:07] <zenith0111> Silver Chariot
[0:47:11] <%shakespearo> @Menitta in the hold?
[0:47:12] <OblivionSword1> that sounds rad as hell
[0:47:13] <DSD24> I love breakdown
[0:47:13] <NYCrownlessKing> ajsHitTheNOS

[0:47:20] <%Pillagius> "colossal" = "Ultra great" from before

[0:47:36] <%whyskeywolfe> Durability doesn't exist dude.
[0:47:37] <TheotherKristian> The ass stomp is fun as fuck
[0:47:37] <@Solidus_113> this game doesn't have durability

[0:48:09] <%funya_rinpa> He knew about durability from the first stream, fellas
[0:48:13] <+eanscrale> that's the biggest lesson they learned from breath of the wild
[0:48:14] <%Reveresao> Hes talking about DS2 chat...........
[0:48:14] <%MajorCrasher> durability heals every time you sit at a fire in DS2
[0:48:14] <%whyskeywolfe> We played ourselves.
[0:48:18] <+Jiggisnipe> lol chat
[0:48:19] <NYCrownlessKing> he was implying chat
[0:48:20] <zenith0111> Durability in videogames is overall an overdone concept
[0:48:21] <%andre11dr> Well that's a DS2 problem in general, things had terrible durability
[0:48:23] <@Menitta> lmao
[0:48:23] <+hoenhime344> he is wooliesplaining himself
[0:48:24] <grouchomarxy> I'm enjoying the no durability change
[0:48:25] <NYCrownlessKing> you played yourselves
[0:48:25] <+RealThiele> i think its less correcting and more excitement from souls players durability sucks
[0:48:27] <%pauperofthesouth> @ozzrabbit oh nice! that will be on my next playthrough. My character is BIG dumb.  Just Str, Dex and End
[0:48:36] <%Prevot> BotW durability complains are overblown as fuck
[0:48:41] <Louie_Salmon> Link is a gun and swords are bullets
[0:48:41] <blackkanye> Yeah DS2 durability on everything was horrid
[0:48:42] <+thedream_c> its not just played out but in a game of scope, I don't like durability being a thing
[0:48:49] <+thedream_c> in the scope of Elden ring I mean
[0:48:53] <%andre11dr> Honestly durability as a concept is kinda wack ,like when has it ever been fun?
[0:48:59] <%shakespearo> hot take, BOTW durability is good and an essential part of the gameplay loop
[0:49:01] <%Lion_kun> BotW
[0:49:03] <zenith0111> It either never mattered or you were stressing about it breaking with zero inbetween
[0:49:11] <+Arnoldoaad1> dex greatsword
[0:49:12] <%Lion_kun> The only game
[0:49:16] <stormhawk9891> Heavy
[0:49:18] <xxHungryxx> Heavy
[0:49:22] <grouchomarxy> It's like a weird resource management thing that doesn't really make a game fun, just adds a layer of unnecessary complexity
[0:49:22] <Afroperonista> "botw durability is good!" BatChest
[0:49:26] <%shakespearo> Commander Keen
[0:49:28] <%khalcipher> keen is dex, i think?
[0:49:29] <DTGL_Bhagavan> Peep the critical…this weapon is strong early game
[0:49:30] <%hax_metatron> New words LUL
[0:49:33] <+solzan2000> theres people that don't like botw for that
[0:49:38] <OblivionSword1> new naming
[0:49:38] <Louie_Salmon> Scaling
[0:49:45] <%andre11dr> Botw is more fun with infinite durability mod
[0:49:52] <%hax_metatron> From loves giving something well known a new name out of nowhere for no reason
[0:49:58] <+thedream_c> in a big crafting game with multiple weapon slots, durability may feel more better I guess
[0:49:59] <+GilroyGoldBlood> hell yeah
[0:50:03] <Akai_Akira> @andre11dr It's an Int sword needs 38,
[0:50:04] <+thedream_c> that startup tho
[0:50:08] <wandelmilch> Millionstab
[0:50:12] <zenith0111> @afroperonista Rather than make wide variety of enemy designs that dictate different tools to beat we just made them all limited 4Head
[0:50:14] <blackkanye> botw, but I can just use what weapons I want because durability doesn't exist. I don't care if it is weak if it looks cool
[0:50:15] <+GilroyGoldBlood> god, that'd be so hard with a sword that big
[0:50:16] <%Deasmeister> Not dmc lol
[0:50:18] <+Axellogic> theres a dungeon you can see on your map nearby a little west, like you can see the entrance in the map's drawing. Pat wanted us to point you to it.
[0:50:24] <%hax_metatron> Faster on faster weapons I believe.
[0:50:28] <OblivionSword1> is there a charge version ?
[0:50:29] <+sevorai> OMG with how accurate hitboxes are you could dodge an attack with htat lil spinaroony
[0:50:30] <+thedream_c> yeah use a faster wep
[0:50:35] <Johannen> Could it be faster on the estoc?
[0:50:38] <Louie_Salmon> Not dmc, YET
[0:50:39] <%americandrm> there's a ash of war that let's you bloodline dash Close to there
[0:50:41] <DTGL_Bhagavan> It’s more of a punish
[0:50:41] <wandelmilch> Startup looks cool but that shits slow
[0:50:42] <+thedream_c> maybe light spear or rapeer
[0:50:43] <+GilroyGoldBlood> Yeah, I think it's faster on lighter weapons
[0:50:43] <xxHungryxx> Put bleed on it too
[0:50:46] <OblivionSword1> does the startup change with lighter weapons ?
[0:50:46] <nintega010> Yeah he can get the guts sword pretty easy not gonna tell him where, but he can get it
[0:50:50] <%americandrm> bloodborne dash
[0:51:02] <+sevorai> BLUD
[0:51:03] <Jontman42> beasts all over the shop
[0:51:05] <+RealThiele> good to ccut a charge short
[0:51:06] <blackkanye> I hear there is a above the person nothing personnel AOW
[0:51:06] <+thedream_c> bleedus
[0:51:08] <IzanagiNoOokami> What's that smell?
[0:51:20] <nintega010> the wolfman sword looks cool to
[0:51:21] <+RealThiele> everyone got a crippling gold addiction
[0:51:33] <kevlarkoala> @zenith0111  BOTW's durability is perfect because it's BOTH though. it matters a lot early when you're weak, stops mattering as much as you progress and "get stronger" and only really matters at all to remind you to be prepared.
[0:51:37] <stormhawk9891> Poison Bloom
[0:52:06] <+thedream_c> oh yeah that exists too
[0:52:13] <+GilroyGoldBlood> Like, Rohan horse hair ponytail?
[0:52:14] <%funya_rinpa> There are so many cool helmets with sick manes
[0:52:16] <ExpressNode> So for crafting do you have to get blueprints or do you just get more stuff and the list grows?
[0:52:16] <kevlarkoala> no clue why people hate it in BOTW so much, it's such a cool design choice in how it tailors the difficulty
[0:52:21] <%ozzrabbit> @pauperofthesouth and now I gotta ask… did you find the pizza cutter yet? Pretty sure that’s a STR weapon
[0:52:35] <+thedream_c> lol death of the wild
[0:52:42] <+GilroyGoldBlood> @WoolieVersus Could you see if the Ash of War is faster on smaller weapons?
[0:52:50] <%hax_metatron> But right now your dex is low, so even with better scaling, overall dmg is small with quality.
[0:52:50] <%pauperofthesouth> @ozzrabbit lol I haven't even heard of that. gonna check it out now
[0:52:54] <zenith0111> Quality means Dex/Str build
[0:53:05] <velgaduere> testing good
[0:53:08] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus For the most part standart will serve you best until you hit like str/dex of 30 or so
[0:53:09] <+RealThiele> dex not high enough to take advantage of the scaling
[0:53:14] <%americandrm> they work different on smaller weapons
[0:53:18] <+thedream_c> avereagestoc
[0:53:22] <+thedream_c> a lil faster
[0:53:23] <velgaduere> doesn't seem so
[0:53:25] <+GilroyGoldBlood> Aight, thanks for checking
[0:53:25] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:53:29] <%Deasmeister> nope
[0:53:30] <deviljhojho_> nice shield
[0:53:32] <OblivionSword1> slightly faster
[0:53:32] <Dopamien> take your time, I love the breakdown with everything
[0:53:36] <+ds3namecaldara> I haven't found a Poison moss recipe and it has varied the difficulty of certain zones and enemies significantly
[0:53:37] <OblivionSword1> just slightly
[0:53:41] <velgaduere> virtually indistinguishable if there is any difference at all
[0:53:50] <Dopamien> everyone I've seen rushes this game so quickly
[0:53:58] <+thedream_c> check it out!

[1:00:08] <iaraCatunda> do you still fall like the same fall animation as if you're out of the water?
[1:00:12] <user_naim> i love how torrent goes from 0 to 60 in a picosecond
[1:00:14] <%livlinn> nuuuuuu
[1:00:17] <%shakespearo> @zenith0111 And we're better off for it, could you imagine a From Soft water temple
[1:00:18] <Louie_Salmon> @prevot Well Sekiro had it and turns out it's sorta lame
[1:00:23] <+ds3namecaldara> more stamina consumption when swimming in heavy armor
[1:00:28] <%Ebonyglow> how fucked would this game be if you could swim on top of everything else
[1:00:28] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:00:29] <+thedream_c> time to pillage these tombs
[1:00:31] <+RealThiele> grave robbing yeyeye
[1:00:32] <cyberspacecat> Sekiro had swimming, but also Sekiro had only his clothing on
[1:00:34] <%hax_metatron> Looting the dead :O
[1:00:35] <zenith0111> @shakespearo Swimming mechanics were a mistake
[1:00:36] <+GilroyGoldBlood> free runes hell yeah
[1:00:37] <kinkade_77> Rune spot
[1:00:45] <%funya_rinpa> these graves are the best
[1:00:46] <Johannen> OMG, Horse combat is Woolie's true weakness...you have to know left from right
[1:00:49] <%Prevot> @louie_salmon I just don't wanna fall off a cliff at every water edge
[1:00:49] <user_naim> free money
[1:00:52] <ExpressNode> Yeah the horse combat is deceptively difficult. It looks easy buy you can only hit on one side
[1:00:52] <xxHungryxx> Graveyards are good for getting gold runes
[1:00:57] <+Jaromero435> pup snuffed
[1:01:00] <+GilroyGoldBlood> White wolf
[1:01:06] <Louie_Salmon> And it's white
[1:01:07] <+Chimerapractor> @ExpressNode You can hit both.
[1:01:07] <%shakespearo> @zenith0111 even back in mario, the water levels were always the shitty ones lul
[1:01:16] <AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> Gotta us L1 and R1 depending on how you approach
[1:01:19] <%livlinn> shiaCry
[1:01:20] <AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> *use
[1:01:26] <%pauperofthesouth> hwite hwolf
[1:01:28] <TheotherKristian> I'm telling all y'all now, Horse combat with a colossal greatsword is one of the most satisfying experiences out there.
[1:01:29] <+RealThiele> the alpha male LUL
[1:01:35] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Holy shit, I just saw on reddit weather affects magic damage!
[1:01:40] <ExpressNode> @Chimerapractor I guess I've only tried one weapon type but I haven't tried others
[1:01:52] <nintega010> @shakespearo honestly swimming in Horizon seems great
[1:01:55] <+Hollow_Mirage> This game gives you so many golden runes I am alreadu level 29
[1:01:55] <kinkade_77> Wolves jumping in this look so goofy
[1:01:57] <user_naim> @kaisermario fuck off really?
[1:02:03] <iaraCatunda> @kaisermario there's weather??!?!??
[1:02:07] <Louie_Salmon> @kaisermario Or any weapon that deals that damage
[1:02:16] <MinersLoveGames> I really like the greco-roman influence some of the knight armors have.
[1:02:27] <%pauperofthesouth> @KaiserMario speaking on that does anyone know what effect the golden leaves falling at night has on your character? My character has like orange lines at night
[1:02:38] <KaiserMario> @user_naim Yeah, like fire gets weaker on rain, but lighting gets stronger
[1:02:40] <+RealThiele> @KaiserMario bonus runes on kill
[1:02:42] <%HollowedIdjit> The Golden Leaves increase your rune gain
[1:02:47] <+sevorai> golden leaves increases rune amount per mob
[1:02:50] <user_naim> @kaisermario i’m going to lose my mind
[1:02:51] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[1:02:52] <%Ebonyglow> @pauperofthesouth it raises you rune collection
[1:02:53] <+Chimerapractor> @ExpressNode It applies to most weapons. RT for right side, LT for left side.
[1:02:55] <%livlinn> shand7
[1:03:04] <Johannen> Were they pillaged or they just got up and left thier sarcophags?
[1:03:06] <%pauperofthesouth> @MinersLoveGames Wait til Woolie sees D. He'll love his armor
[1:03:07] <+Jiggisnipe> did Reggie finally learn to respect Artorias?

[1:05:15] <Johannen> Good call for roads
[1:05:18] <%Lion_kun> You need to try and keep track where you have been
[1:05:29] <MinersLoveGames> I really love how alive the world feels here. The Dark Souls worlds were already dying and in their twilight by the time you got to them, but here, not so much.
[1:05:31] <%Lion_kun> Explore the map piece by piece
[1:05:32] <+0neReeler> all roads lead to Gran Soren
[1:05:37] <+thedream_c> they climebed up silly

[1:06:11] <+thedream_c> zoinks a caster
[1:06:17] <+froduck42> Dex increases casting speed
[1:06:24] <user_naim> imagine guarding an outpost and seing a motherfucker fly up with a double jumping goat horse
[1:06:43] <user_naim> no doctrine for this
[1:07:12] <+thedream_c> caster wars

[1:10:32] <+barrakuta371> could this horse be a dog?
[1:10:34] <%AngryAsian5> Pyrrhic victory LUL
[1:10:35] <+thedream_c> decided to JUST DO IT
[1:10:35] <Louie_Salmon> Didn't expect horse...
[1:10:36] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> we callin wolves horses, we callin tortoises dogs, we wild in elden ring
[1:10:38] <%BigBruthaThunda> just as GRRM intended
[1:10:39] <fumbles_tho> that spell sucks so bad
[1:10:46] <%CatRidder> canine  horses
[1:10:48] <wandelmilch> Im a bit of a hornblower myself
[1:10:54] <%hax_metatron> You never have to see the "stake", if there's one nearby you always get the option
[1:11:04] <%ArtemisCroc> woolie needs to know that stakes don't have to be activated, they just have an ambient checkpoint field
[1:11:06] <+thedream_c> oh the horse badass was alwasy tehre
[1:11:09] <%americandrm> wait till you get good spells and if you hold it down longer it charges
[1:11:12] <user_naim> big group fights are are fun as hell
[1:11:14] <velgaduere> don't forget you can crouch for stealthiness
[1:11:16] <%pauperofthesouth> oh shit there's a sniper!
[1:11:22] <velgaduere> if that's your angle
[1:11:22] <+thedream_c> oh yeah the snipers
[1:11:23] <+hoenhime344> those guys look like the boy king in ds3 firelink
[1:11:32] <%pauperofthesouth> go left of the structure, woolie
[1:11:35] <%americandrm> if you hold some spells down longer they charge
[1:11:36] <xxHungryxx> Spell snipers
[1:11:39] <Omenaire_> i love that prisoner helmet
[1:11:45] <+hoenhime344> goat
[1:12:00] <velgaduere> if Skyrim taught us anything, horses are even better at going up than they are at going forward
[1:12:06] <oda_flobunaga> check out that half bowl thing
[1:12:09] <+Nekros4442> didnt examine the scroll yet
[1:12:25] <user_naim> so is torrent brazilian?
[1:12:37] <%andre11dr> Honestly it's cool that i sorcerers got more diversified
[1:13:19] <Louie_Salmon> Pro-tip, don't run while circling on horseback, just walk
[1:13:21] <%andre11dr> Like I'm playing with Aracane and it seems way more different than what the straight forward mages get
[1:13:31] <xxHungryxx> Yeah, Woolie will love Carian Piercer & Slicer
[1:13:44] <+Fetrigon> chill out on the killing woolie. Reggie is fucking climaxing over here. creepy49Porpkek creepy49Porpkek creepy49Porpkek
[1:13:48] <%americandrm> your spell shop is close by woolieGASM
[1:13:55] <Raldavar> Has 4 legs, horns, and climbs steep cliffs. It's a goat
[1:14:00] <DanteReaver> I wish there was more stuff that was just arcane, but I'm only at the start so there might be
[1:14:03] <%RyTYoung> Is Woolie near the Lake?
[1:14:05] <%pauperofthesouth> Now Woolie si the sniper
[1:14:09] <%Giothegame> Boys!
[1:14:16] <DanteReaver> Usually its arcane faith or arcane int
[1:14:17] <%andre11dr> @raldavar It's a Iagoul
[1:14:22] <+Fetrigon> no
[1:14:34] <%pauperofthesouth> lol your ghost buys are stuck
[1:14:34] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:14:57] <%americandrm> arcane was luck it would be terrible to have to mix your points from int to arcane no like bro
[1:15:04] <TigerClaws12> give em a minute LUL
[1:15:08] <+Jaromero435> they have some problems it seems
[1:15:08] <agustorm123> I prefer long range spirits
[1:15:10] <zenith0111> Be mindful where you summon because some of them cant even move
[1:15:18] <velgaduere> AAAAAaaaaa...
[1:15:20] <+0neReeler> summon the bums
[1:15:24] <PenguinPall> Hey Woolie, I want to let you know that I heard that if you wear that curved sword, a npc will be hostile when you meet them...
[1:15:26] <%hax_metatron> They tanky though, fully upgraded and they're basically tank friends
[1:15:30] <%holydeviant1> "Boys?"  [panicked tumbling down a slope]
[1:15:31] <+hoenhime344> jump him
[1:15:33] <jacknerik> You just summoned 4 copies of prince Phillip
[1:15:34] <%pauperofthesouth> i need to stop cheesing the jellyfish summon
[1:15:36] <%Reveresao> @WoolieVersus maybe put magic on left?
[1:15:36] <kamenriderkickk> The torch is OP
[1:15:41] <%Prevot> woolie doesn't have the best girl spirit yet, does he?
[1:15:45] <OblivionSword1> fortunately they teleport
[1:15:45] <%hax_metatron> They follow you magically
[1:15:46] <%HeroToxiko> lol no
[1:15:48] <+mechslayer71> in a fromsoft game? wouldn't count on it
[1:15:54] <%andre11dr> @copametic Arcane affects certain spells and weapons, it's not just luck
[1:16:08] <xxHungryxx> Wolves and jellyfish are the only good summons early on
[1:16:12] <%pauperofthesouth> @Prevot must not. because that would be all he used
[1:16:26] <zenith0111> Arcane also Boosts Weapon Art Damage
[1:16:39] <zenith0111> So if you really love a weapon art do arcane
[1:16:41] <crackedhappiness> Seems like nobles cant fight in any universe
[1:16:41] <%pauperofthesouth> oh feck
[1:16:46] <+0neReeler> he ignored the boys
[1:16:47] <+Jiggisnipe> corner pressure
[1:16:48] <%HeroToxiko> your boys just watched
[1:16:52] <velgaduere> what is with the doppler effect when Woolie takes damage LUL
[1:16:55] <%CatRidder> use the counter against himç
[1:17:01] <+Axellogic> You gotta burst to get out of corner traps
[1:17:02] <%pauperofthesouth> yo, those your boys?
[1:17:08] <QueequegTheater> QueequegTheater subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 31 months! Good to see Woolie has not yet sacrificed Reggie for his castle yet
[1:17:17] <QueequegTheater> yet yet
[1:17:18] <user_naim> @velgaduere got sent flying from the mic
[1:17:19] <QueequegTheater> fuck
[1:17:27] <velgaduere> @user_naim lobosKek
[1:17:29] <agustorm123> Why are we still in limgrave?
[1:17:32] <%funya_rinpa> woolie the merciless
[1:17:44] <@Menitta> @agustorm123 it is very big.
[1:17:53] <%andre11dr> It's seems like the more demonic spells are Arcane, like the blood spells and the other ones that give you madness
[1:17:55] <DanteReaver> Im ok with them going slowly
[1:17:57] <velgaduere> @agustorm123 because this game is huge and there's a lot to get distracted by
[1:18:00] <user_naim> @agustorm123 because these fools have to learn who runs the place
[1:18:02] <%Prevot> @agustorm123 bruh woolie hasn't even beat Margareth yet
[1:18:03] <%funya_rinpa> has woolie touched margit already or nah?
[1:18:04] <%HeroToxiko> @velgaduere thats the sound of you being staggered
[1:18:05] <user_naim> wolf pack!
[1:18:06] <DanteReaver> It actually makes it watchable cause no spilers
[1:18:22] <jacknerik> @Prevot has he even seen marge yet?
[1:18:41] <+Das_Prints> He hasnt
[1:18:46] <%edgeroth> so far woolie has been exploring the world
[1:18:48] <+Axellogic> @funya_rinpa he hasnt even smelled a whiff of hiim
[1:18:54] <+Byr0nX> this game is big like Pat's mom
[1:18:56] <%MajorCrasher> @jacknerik Marge Simpson?
[1:18:56] <@Menitta> There's so much to see
[1:18:57] <grouchomarxy> Let the man explore in peace damn lol
[1:19:01] <+Jiggisnipe> I don't believe Woolie has gone to the castle yet, he's exploring
[1:19:02] <%pauperofthesouth> I like watching Woolie play becuse it's so unlike my style. he goes in GUNS BLAZING
[1:19:11] <+sevorai> I didnt touch margit until I was like 10 hours in and was lvl 24
[1:19:20] <%Prevot> seems like woolie is avoided the critical path like the plague
[1:19:29] <DanteReaver> Yeah me too @sevorai
[1:19:32] <xxHungryxx> @majorcrasher Yep. No go buy eggs for Bart
[1:19:38] <%andre11dr> @sevorai I'm 35 in ,still haven't fought him
[1:19:48] <%edgeroth> avoiding the critical path is the best way to play the game
[1:19:48] <+Dakuu75> @Prevot Like a true gamer~
[1:19:50] <linSP> who’s margit, 50 hrs in btw
[1:19:51] <OblivionSword1> new kicks
[1:19:59] <+sevorai> margit for me was a push into stormveil and the area beyond that so i didnt touch it til later
[1:19:59] <%pauperofthesouth> @andre11dr oh you're gonna wash him
[1:20:04] <+twenty112> The last soldier also dropped an item
[1:20:08] <user_naim> i explored what i thought was all of limgrave before margit. and i still missed a bunch of shit
[1:20:11] <%funya_rinpa> To be honest, avoiding the path is gonna work extremely well in his favor with how wild Margit is early on
[1:20:13] <%Bread_Assassin> @Prevot That's for the best 'cause critical path will fuck him up.
[1:20:26] <+Byr0nX> treasure chest in the camp to
[1:20:49] <%andre11dr> @pauperofthesouth I mean i imagine so ,I'm like level 55
[1:20:49] <user_naim> It was fun to occasionally check up on margit like ”hey, how much health did you have again?”
[1:20:53] <SomeAsianDood> Is he always gonna run with the default prisoner helmet or has he just not found anything better?
[1:20:53] <%MajorCrasher> why would you skip past limgrave when there's so much cool shit to find?
[1:21:02] <%pauperofthesouth> @andre11dr oh shit! haha yeah
[1:21:06] <user_naim> @andre11dr jesus you’ll fuck him up
[1:21:16] <%Reveresao> Stop killing the peasants  gigaboOtsBaneyUnleashed
[1:21:16] <+vaderxyz1970> That weezing noise is the funniest thing ill never get tired ove
[1:21:22] <DanteReaver> I scrapped all of Limgrave start and the forest area to east
[1:21:43] <DanteReaver> and then finally decided to go past Margit
[1:21:43] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[1:22:27] <jacknerik> @SomeAsianDood I like how the description says "this is designed to torture you" and then all the prisoner players I've seen don't take it off for 20+ hours.

[1:24:01] <SainEdge> Woolie on the road with his best bois
[1:24:02] <%Lion_kun> The moments have not even begun.
[1:24:09] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus it was not a spell but a usable item in the first row
[1:24:11] <%AWKWARDL0SER> Good ole Woolie Wolves
[1:24:19] <+vaderxyz1970> Would be cool if you could charge the summon to fuse them into a large cerberus sumon
[1:24:21] <%DiscoMatador> STINGER BB

[1:25:20] <TheSaggitari> KIRK OR PICARD? AND WHY
[1:25:22] <Louie_Salmon> It's called "heavy thrusting sword" for a reason
[1:25:23] <projecthazoid> BUSTER RAPIER
[1:25:29] <OblivionSword1> that's might as well be a lance LUL

[1:27:31] <+mechslayer71> yeah. that's been known

[1:27:49] <user_naim> yeyeyeyeye
[1:27:52] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yep, just hit that L1 and enjoy
[1:28:00] <+Hollow_Mirage> Every weapon and I mean every weapon has power stance
[1:28:06] <+Grayhammatter> it's just two of the same type of weapon, like sword or dagger
[1:28:10] <%andre11dr> My built is dual wielding great axes and i love it
[1:28:14] <+Brassnarwhal> of the same weapon type to be clear
[1:28:20] <QueequegTheater> RIP Vengarl powerstance :(
[1:28:30] <+Arnoldoaad1> powerstancing daggers is OP
[1:28:31] <%espanishcanamurciana> Drip
[1:28:33] <+0neReeler> dual wield ugs
[1:28:34] <%pauperofthesouth> damn woolie. What are THOSE? get some shoes
[1:28:40] <Louie_Salmon> You needed silly stats for it
[1:28:54] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:28:54] <xxHungryxx> Power stance hook claws 👌
[1:28:54] <Louie_Salmon> Do the jumping attack too
[1:29:08] <QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Try jumping L2
[1:29:09] <%hax_metatron> What about L1?
[1:29:18] <%khalcipher> RT?
[1:29:24] <Omenaire_> so many moveset options its incredible
[1:29:28] <AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> Jump + L1 is goated for that
[1:29:29] <%Dcapit8ed> DARK SOULS 2 2 BAYBEE
[1:29:30] <+mechslayer71> it's based on weapon types, not specific weps btw
[1:29:46] <+Das_Prints> @hax_metatron Attacking with both weapons at the same time is the L1
[1:29:46] <+devonoel> love powerstancing in this game
[1:29:48] <+Arnoldoaad1> Tip: If you have 2 different same class weapons, you will use the ability on the right weapon
[1:29:48] <%andre11dr> See DS2 wasn't all bad
[1:29:55] <%okuriskyles> i just started watching, who is playing?
[1:29:56] <%Lion_kun> Problem is being a magic knight means you can't power stance
[1:29:57] <plankk56> i think they can be different weapons of the same class right?
[1:30:01] <+0neReeler> does blocking do cross swords?
[1:30:04] <%khalcipher> @okuriskyles Woolz
[1:30:04] <%Indigo_Automaton> And you lose the ability to block and guard counter
[1:30:09] <%Lion_kun> You need your other hand for your staff
[1:30:15] <%edgeroth> I've been powerstancing two halberds and it's awesome
[1:30:16] <Louie_Salmon> @0nereeler No block, all offense
[1:30:25] <zenith0111> Whats your weight tho?
[1:30:27] <+Das_Prints> @plankk56 yeah as long as they are the same type you can do those double attacks.
[1:30:31] <+0neReeler> ah
[1:30:35] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus one other thing, try the charged R2 and tap dodge
[1:30:36] <NYCrownlessKing> until you give one of the weapons a guard counter
[1:30:39] <DGmaka> Woolie familiar with greatsword instant crouch slashing?
[1:30:42] <@Solidus_113> with the estoc
[1:30:52] <Louie_Salmon> Oh yeah, the charged attack escapes
[1:30:57] <linSP> power stance barehand a thing? I never checked
[1:31:09] <+0neReeler> oraoraora
[1:31:17] <Louie_Salmon> Footsies
[1:31:18] <%Indigo_Automaton> Backstep attacks
[1:31:19] <zenith0111> YRS
[1:31:25] <BlackermanZX> oh you got footsies
[1:31:40] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus You can also do a unique feint with curved swords
[1:31:47] <OblivionSword1> you rapier footsies
[1:31:54] <OblivionSword1> yooo
[1:31:56] <zenith0111> YO BACKTURN ATTACKS
[1:32:01] <+Byr0nX> OPTION
[1:32:03] <Louie_Salmon> Each weapon type gets unique ones
[1:32:17] <DanteReaver> You got Justice's SBT
[1:32:21] <+Brazuka91> is that a lance or a big ass estoc?
[1:32:26] <Johannen> Isnt it only for thrusting and curved swords? I could not do anything else?
[1:32:27] <Louie_Salmon> @brazuka91 Yes
[1:32:28] <user_naim> what a video game
[1:32:38] <+sevorai> big ass Epee to be exact
[1:32:42] <NYCrownlessKing> its like a ds2 gemstone for magic
[1:32:59] <zenith0111> They got drunk off starlight
[1:33:01] <%kimbucha> apparently the messages that say "Fort, night" and "Try fingers, but hole" have been very confusing for Japanese players
[1:33:05] <linSP> starlight shard helped win a couple bosses
[1:33:16] <DanteReaver> @kimbucha LMAO

[1:34:21] <+OneGorillionDollars> MORE POWER
[1:34:22] <%holydeviant1> My fave trainer is in the CHapel of Vows, but I woon't tell why

[1:34:47] <user_naim> SingsNote I’m not a magic maaan, and i know i get wrong SingsNote
[1:34:50] <%Prevot> woolie has explored so much and still hasn't found the magic teacher?
[1:34:56] <NYCrownlessKing> you passed the notes
[1:35:06] <%TheHateFish> @Prevot Seems not, no
[1:35:20] <+Arnoldoaad1> @froduck42 they probably wont want to know but i will say that i didnt found her until hour 30
[1:35:22] <%MajorCrasher> the magic teacher is in a pretty random spot tbh
[1:35:31] <%andre11dr> @hollow_mirage Also some melee weapons have spells weapons arts which is cool
[1:35:35] <+MooseIsGoose> @MajorCrasher It is I missed her forever
[1:35:41] <+Das_Prints> Depending on where he goes next after all this reading he might be getting there.
[1:35:42] <Johannen> @Prevot I totaly missed Patches and that whole zone if not for Woolie, that's just how it goes
[1:35:47] <@Solidus_113> go get that

[1:54:17] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> chat, a man cannot gesture if he doesn't have said gesture
[1:54:19] <%HeroToxiko> maybe a local knows the weird wolf guy
[1:54:21] <%AyotoCorp> There's clues on the ground
[1:54:24] <+GilroyGoldBlood> @theyseemerowling just gotta come upon it
[1:54:27] <%Irridium> @theyseemerowling you have to stumble upon it
[1:54:28] <VJdarkworld> First off merchant, and then try Gesture
[1:54:32] <zenith0111> @kybernasse Did you forget? LUL Theres at least 1 jumping puzzle per soulsborne

[1:54:44] <%jepupu> uwu
[1:54:46] <+Das_Prints> @theyseemerowling you just gotta stumble upon it. But the solution is from a place you probably will interact with often.
[1:54:46] <linSP> I failed his quest because a nearby bear knocked down the wall underneath him
[1:54:47] <+MooseIsGoose> Go to kale

[1:55:00] <MyNameIsRasus> need timestop
[1:55:04] <+678saintglock> oh man
[1:55:07] <KingOfTheGeats> I stumbled into it because I needed to buy something from Santa
[1:55:07] <theyseemerowling> Oh! Okay.

[1:55:15] <+Jaromero435> the homies
[1:55:19] <VJdarkworld> @solidus_113 ive been using the map markers to specifically keep track of npcs

[1:55:28] <wandelmilch> That would be sick if it worked
[1:55:29] <%edgeroth> ooohh that would've been a cool solution
[1:55:32] <theyseemerowling> Woolie, 10/10 for OTB thinking
[1:55:32] <%shakespearo> the thought was good, but alas no
[1:55:33] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> watch Woolie find some secret method
[1:55:35] <+tempestzephyr> the answer is not really obvious
[1:55:38] <+678saintglock> that would be cool tho
[1:55:38] <+0neReeler> [immediately attacks bear]

[1:55:48] <ChoculaUltra> that would've been clever
[1:55:51] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Summons wont attack unless you do it
[1:55:52] <kyluewack> You get the gesture from Santa “kale” the merchant.
[1:55:54] <agustorm123> They are confuse

[1:57:23] <+GilroyGoldBlood> @kyluewack The same way everyone else found out. By coming across it naturally
[1:57:28] <%shakespearo> I found it out on my own and I didn't need a thousand people yelling about it within a minute. people need to shaddap
[1:57:28] <QueequegTheater> @kyluewack Don't spoil it unless they ask for advice
[1:57:30] <Johannen> Scarab had a strategy
[1:57:35] <+Brassnarwhal> woolie you should check kalé for new speech options at the church of elleh
[1:57:41] <%hax_metatron> Good for other mounted enemies but not otherwise
[1:57:43] <QueequegTheater> CHAT
[1:57:45] <QueequegTheater> SHUT UP
[1:57:46] <+GilroyGoldBlood> Chat bruh
[1:57:48] <%edgeroth> lol
[1:57:50] <NYCrownlessKing> brass he said stop
[1:57:57] <NYCrownlessKing> so STOP lol
[1:57:58] <+Das_Prints> Yeah it’s a lot easier to miss with the thrusts on horseback
[1:58:01] <kyluewack> It’s not that serious
[1:58:07] <theyseemerowling> @Raldavar Damn, he's even wearing the Hawk shield
[1:58:15] <%shakespearo> Woolie you should read the strategy guide so that there is no way you could discover something on your own
[1:58:16] <user_naim> @queequegtheater we’re going to need some time outs and message deletions à la Sajam’s chat i feel
[1:58:18] <%Bread_Assassin> As chat, sometimes we just need to let woolie bash his head against a wall fruitlessly, That is our sworn burden.
[1:58:23] <dinnydanny777> This Epee is so big it looks like a lance
[1:58:29] <+Brassnarwhal> literally didnt see it I'm playing too woolie was just apeculating about it for like 5 minutes my bad
[1:58:32] <%MajorCrasher> I get it chat, but some people enjoy wandering blindly lol. let them play without tips
[1:58:34] <QueequegTheater> @user_naim If I was mod there would be multiple already
[1:58:38] <%TheBesteban> "Yo you got any Fiji water? I'm parched"
[1:58:49] <theyseemerowling> Man, this guy always hits me in the feels
[1:58:53] <chili_nobeans> tbh emote only mode
[1:59:00] <NYCrownlessKing> gonna need to mod besteban to start blasting
[1:59:01] <%andre11dr> Sleep arrows are really useful
[1:59:03] <theyseemerowling> Just sounds like he needs a good day. All the time.
[1:59:13] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> hey woolie go directly to the blimbo district and you'll get the key to shabadoo your welcome ;)
[1:59:15] <@Solidus_113> flesh boosts your damage
[1:59:15] <%notsoy> BTW you can sell Golden runes instead of having to exit the merchant menu
[1:59:16] <+theoldone001> I like watching Woolie just figure shit out, you only get one time to experience Souls like games for the 1st time. If y'all want a guidethrough this ain't it lol
[1:59:22] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> exalted flesh is pretty nice
[1:59:50] <+GilroyGoldBlood> @ozzrabbit bruh

[2:00:29] <+Jaromero435> chat was a mistake

[2:00:51] <jimgimp> grymL
[2:00:53] <%shakespearo> hey, here is where you get the items to get to the endgame, it would be so boring to see you figure it out woolie /S
[2:00:54] <%andre11dr> Get the scrimbo located under generic rock number 54 and then trade it for the ancient bafmodad to unlock the sex scene with wolf boy
[2:01:01] <huskarl_zap> Fort,night.

[2:14:45] <%andre11dr> Just guessing
[2:14:50] <theyseemerowling> @CateHecate Marika, not Melina
[2:14:53] <%khalcipher> thats Marika, it appears in the opening cinematic
[2:15:06] <Frazbeee> Kenneth "most lit on the planet" Haight
[2:15:12] <%andre11dr> Ah yes Marika not Melina
[2:15:17] <theyseemerowling> @CateHecate Sorry, replied to the wrong message

[2:16:12] <Johannen> big confuse
[2:16:12] <+Flunkorg> its just an extra
[2:16:13] <MyNameIsRasus> This is unrelated from estus altogether
[2:16:14] <theyseemerowling> It's its own thing
[2:16:14] <yukichocomilk> it's a separate bottle
[2:16:25] <+Javaa01> It is just a 3rd consumable type, entirely separate from HP and FP
[2:16:26] <%shakespearo> there'S some really cool effects for this shit, use it every fight
[2:16:26] <+Grayhammatter> it's just its own thing
[2:16:26] <+hoenhime344> @Flunkorg no.. its not
[2:16:28] <zenith0111> Its automatically equipprd to your hotbar btw
[2:16:32] <%andre11dr> This is the one that you get to customize
[2:16:35] <%Bread_Assassin> I would totally forgo having the regular estus for more charges of this.

[2:17:28] <+Javaa01> @MajorCrasher Well, yeah kinda, Estus plusses are very easy to get
[2:17:29] <@Solidus_113> it's temporary
[2:17:30] <%shakespearo> free stamina is nice as well
[2:17:34] <@Solidus_113> like a couple minutes
[2:17:35] <%TheHateFish> @MajorCrasher The base flask tends to heal more than that, honestly

[2:22:07] <Louie_Salmon> Truly maidenless
[2:22:07] <%CateHecate> PARRY THE HANDHOLDING
[2:22:09] <depressioncherrie> just wait until Woolie gets to hug
[2:22:10] <+darkfoxxs> Damn STILL no Maidens?
[2:22:13] <%CateHecate> BLOW HER POSTURE OPEN
[2:22:14] <%holydeviant1> IIRC she always shows up in churches
[2:22:17] <+Flunkorg> Hey chat. Isn't woolie technically grapeless right now too?
[2:22:20] <grouchomarxy> She said "hold my hand you maidenless wretch"
[2:22:21] <+theoldone001> It ain't no Maiden in Black's prayer, but she aight
[2:22:25] <+spaced142> maidenless behavior
[2:22:34] <yukichocomilk> "I love y- oh she's gone.."
[2:22:41] <kes009900> when will they mod in some shackles, so we dont have to miss her?
[2:22:49] <%edgeroth> "please hold my hand" lol
[2:22:54] <+Arnoldoaad1> didnt woolie had another sacred tear?
[2:23:02] <+Flunkorg> I love how they just put in on your bar for you, thats so nice.
[2:23:09] <+GilroyGoldBlood> I put my Physick in the quickbar so i didn't accidentally use it
[2:23:12] <BlackermanZX> chug it
[2:23:12] <+robertoszek> oh I immediately turn the hud to always on
[2:23:14] <%pauperofthesouth> I like that woolie has full head, chest and arms armor but like linen pants
[2:23:26] <%jvilly96> Yea you can make the hud stay on
[2:23:30] <%shakespearo> @pauperofthesouth sweat pants are comfy ok
[2:23:30] <%AlteisenReiseZ> And Double Axe Medallion buff
[2:23:38] <%pauperofthesouth> @pauperofthesouth 😆
[2:23:46] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> what every open world should do tbh
[2:23:48] <scrumbotime> a big fall will knock the wind outta ya
[2:23:52] <%ArcBreak> Does the charge attack buff work on spells ?
[2:23:53] <@Solidus_113> the buff also resets when you sit, so you can't drink > sit and keep the buff, plus have another flask
[2:23:53] <%edgeroth> definitely a good decision
[2:23:55] <grouchomarxy> @pauperofthesouth you gotta have somewhere to vent all that heat
[2:24:01] <theyseemerowling> @pauperofthesouth It's fine. He'll just kinkshame anyone who looks down before they attack the feet
[2:24:01] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Waypoint!
[2:24:06] <derap41> stops people from rolling everywhere or Link yippings
[2:24:08] <zenith0111> Thats so smart too because then you wont have to worry about players running into encounters with no stamina lol
[2:24:13] <%shakespearo> did they check out the tree last time?
[2:24:22] <%pauperofthesouth> @pauperofthesouth ha true
[2:24:30] <QueequegTheater> Maybe go east Kappa

[2:24:54] <%shakespearo> East is Searing Gaspain Land

[2:38:46] <agustorm123> We going places

[2:38:48] <@Solidus_113> Hub boys
[2:38:50] <%Reveresao> I think you can trigger the hub by going to another area beside Limgrave and sitting at a grace
[2:38:51] <+678saintglock> “it turns out, you’s a bitch”
[2:38:53] <+Javaa01> Okay so welcome to the Nexus
[2:38:53] <bonesonhigh> Activate the Joestar Tactic
[2:38:53] <ThatChainmecha> yes
[2:38:55] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> likely
[2:38:56] <%hax_metatron> YES
[2:38:57] <agustorm123> Basically
[2:38:57] <Johannen> Nobody knows
[2:38:58] <+Brassnarwhal> wait how did that proc the hub WHAT
[2:38:59] <%funya_rinpa> not quite
[2:39:02] <ThatChainmecha> it happened to me here
[2:39:02] <QueequegTheater> No one knows
[2:39:02] <wandelmilch> no one fucking knows
[2:39:02] <MyNameIsRasus> not quite
[2:39:04] <ThatChainmecha> YES
[2:39:06] <+Flunkorg> @WoolieVersus nobody knows the triggers woolie who knows.
[2:39:07] <+Proxzo> NO ONE KNOWS
[2:39:07] <%funya_rinpa> oh yeah, that
[2:39:07] <+Hollow_Mirage> Yes
[2:39:08] <MyNameIsRasus> it's very obtuse
[2:39:08] <%Prevot> nah I got it way earlier
[2:39:11] <+Javaa01> Yesn't
[2:39:16] <%CateHecate> explore THOROUGHLY
[2:39:18] <+Axellogic> its uncertain
[2:39:19] <jacknerik> I think it's based on seeing enough bosses
[2:39:23] <+Arnoldoaad1> NO ONE KNOWS, this will 100% activate if you kill margit
[2:39:23] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:39:24] <+PkSilent01> Welcome to the Nexus/ Firelink Shrine/ Majula/ Hunter's Dream/ Dilapidated Temple
[2:39:26] <+scarman125> I can't believe it took him 3 sessions to get to the Round Table
[2:39:27] <user_naim> we couldn’t backseat if we wanted to
[2:39:32] <ThatChainmecha> if you go to certain plaves it always gives you an invitation
[2:39:34] <%MajorCrasher> you'd think it'd be datamined by now
[2:39:38] <+Brassnarwhal> @prevot after the first boss from the network test or somewhere else?
[2:39:40] <MurseJOCO> Initiate thorough walk around
[2:39:47] <QueequegTheater> those always work Kappa
[2:39:49] <+Based_Moose> Grace by the trees, Grace by the sea, Grace underground, Grace all  around.
[2:39:53] <AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> Now fight the guy
[2:39:54] <linSP> jump on those fools
[2:39:55] <+jeffthesequel> It triggered for me afte beating 5 bosses.
[2:39:56] <+Hollow_Mirage> Literally I did everything in limgrave other then stormveil and didn’t get it until I entered the beast temple
[2:39:57] <+Arnoldoaad1> no fight zone... unless
[2:39:58] <+darkfoxxs> Stuff on this game certainly seem to have triggers but they aren’t always clear even if you think they are
[2:39:59] <%DreamCancel01> I should've waited to make the blunt rotation joke
[2:40:03] <+Flunkorg> Chat shut up
[2:40:03] <+Hollow_Mirage> So its area
[2:40:04] <theyseemerowling> It's the Hunter's Dream, kinda.
[2:40:12] <+Jiggisnipe> it's the Nexus?
[2:40:13] <%pauperofthesouth> this is Switzerland
[2:40:13] <theyseemerowling> More like the Nexus, I guess.

[2:41:20] <bonesonhigh> pathetic sort ahead
[2:41:28] <zenith0111> He wears that as a symbol of the elden ring
[2:41:28] <ThatChainmecha> faith users are lmae
[2:41:29] <%shakespearo> that wheel is like, a kink thing right
[2:41:31] <%okuriskyles> just because you're blind doesn't mean you can't see
[2:41:38] <%pauperofthesouth> Deep
[2:41:40] <%okuriskyles> it's like being killed and dying
[2:41:42] <ThatChainmecha> imagine using faith lol
[2:41:48] <AgnusLaplace> @Brassnarwhal you can rest next to the giant grace in the table, while standing next to the table
[2:41:51] <%pauperofthesouth> D
[2:41:51] <%CateHecate> OH D IS HERE RIGHT NOW????
[2:41:56] <%CateHecate> THAT IS INSANE
[2:42:01] <ThatChainmecha> D is always here?
[2:42:08] <+KingpinLarry> Has Woolie gone through Stormveil Castle yet? I haven't seen any other streams of his for this.
[2:42:12] <ThatChainmecha> have you guys not played the game
[2:42:15] <NYCrownlessKing> yes d is always there
[2:42:15] <zenith0111> @catehecate Is he not always
[2:42:15] <theyseemerowling> I'm pretty sure D isn't always here
[2:42:17] <+PkSilent01> @CateHecate Wait did he ever met him outside or this is his first meeting?
[2:42:20] <+Javaa01> @ThatChainmecha Nah, if you unlock this place via Stormveil, D isn't here yet
[2:42:20] <%okuriskyles> I don't think D is always here, he wasn't here when I first arrived
[2:42:21] <ThatChainmecha> he is
[2:42:21] <bonesonhigh> he hasnt even gone to stormhill yet
[2:42:23] <BlackermanZX> built different
[2:42:30] <jacknerik> @KingpinLarry He has not seen Marge
[2:42:32] <+678saintglock> you, are built different
[2:42:33] <%shakespearo> he is not always there, we was not there for me the first time I got to the hold
[2:42:37] <%CateHecate> D isnt here unless you meet him or i guess unless you go to the beast chapel
[2:42:39] <+Das_Prints> D isn’t always here. I got here by dying to Margit early and D didn’t show up to the table till much later.
[2:42:40] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @ThatChainmecha wasn't there for me
[2:42:41] <QueequegTheater> Faith DansGame
[2:42:44] <bonesonhigh> They're dumb good
[2:42:44] <+PkSilent01> @okuriskyles maybe because he went into the beast church?
[2:42:47] <%Pillagius> @NYCrownlessKing no you can meet him earlier near the undead boatman bossfight
[2:42:48] <%pauperofthesouth> RyuChamp D
[2:42:51] <Gnukko88> Faithbros
[2:42:52] <tolloponik> I think D will always appear here after you talk to the beast lord
[2:42:53] <agustorm123> Faithless
[2:42:54] <Ersov> Faith Kreygasm
[2:42:55] <%slipdog> best game for faith yet
[2:42:55] <ThatChainmecha> I found D here before i did his side quest, but i also found the beast guy before
[2:42:57] <+678saintglock> maybe he’s only there if you go to the beast church firdt
[2:42:58] <BlackermanZX> Urgent Heal is very usful
[2:42:59] <%edgeroth> miracles are crazy in this game
[2:43:03] <Gnukko88> Faithless curs must not apply
[2:43:06] <%Theycallmenerf> Get the eye trap one
[2:43:06] <ThatChainmecha> 678 that confirms it
[2:43:09] <PissyJay> I'm doing a project for a twitch streamer for a college class and he said you're his favorite streamer and wanted me to model his stuff after you! I can see why he likes you, its been awesome following you!
[2:43:11] <%Theycallmenerf> That’s a cool one
[2:43:12] <theyseemerowling> @CateHecate Ah, because of the chapel. Does that mean he won't meet him outside?
[2:43:12] <+Brassnarwhal> @blackermanzx i like to use it to top off
[2:43:14] <@Moobot> Easy with the emojis @saintd263
[2:43:17] <bonesonhigh> Combustion is A+ in this game
[2:43:18] <ThatChainmecha> nope
[2:43:38] <%holydeviant1> Pyro is now folded into faith
[2:43:40] <ThatChainmecha> he didnt even tell me about deathroots in my playthorugh
[2:43:40] <%CateHecate> @theyseemerowling maybe? who knows
[2:43:40] <%hax_metatron> They're all good man
[2:43:42] <%CateHecate> game too big
[2:43:45] <%Theycallmenerf> Oh you can charge up incantations and sorceries too I believe.
[2:43:49] <bonesonhigh> Mash combustion and bosses evaporate
[2:43:50] <%slipdog> rule of cool always #1
[2:43:50] <%hax_metatron> I started a dupliocate poison / bleed build. IT RULES

[2:45:55] <AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> FIREBALL!

[2:45:58] <AnthroMetal> @Brassnarwhal not yet
[2:46:00] <+Flunkorg> Fire bad reggie
[2:46:03] <+tempestzephyr> tree hate fire
[2:46:04] <jacknerik> Blasphemy is still a part of faith
[2:46:04] <%espanishcanamurciana> I think the hub procs after a certain amount of graces found
[2:46:08] <+vaderxyz1970> Fire hurt tree
[2:46:08] <LuckyTerry> Woolie the Liar is from which Realm? LUL LUL <3 SeemsGood

[2:46:14] <zhenthrim213> im doin a dark knight build
[2:46:14] <zenith0111> This is technically "Godslaying Magic"
[2:46:14] <iambqb> So Incantation in this game is like the Faith builds combined with the Pyro builds of the souls game with some new spells sprinkled in
[2:46:16] <BlackermanZX> people love trees so fire is a no no
[2:46:17] <+vaderxyz1970> unless your a pinecone tree
[2:46:19] <%Namillus> Well the big sacred object of worship is a tree, right? Fire bad
[2:46:20] <+Brassnarwhal> @anthrometal it looks fucking sick
[2:46:27] <user_naim> So pyro is still bullshit heresy, nice
[2:46:27] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[2:46:33] <%DapperCadavr> ratJAM
[2:46:35] <+Javaa01> But this also means, Pyromancy scales with stats properly
[2:46:35] <%Reveresao> right, tree hate fire and people worship tree so fire magic bad
[2:46:38] <%holydeviant1> Man, I can't wait for Chapel of Vows now
[2:46:38] <AnthroMetal> @Brassnarwhal considering the amount of times i've been pancaked by it, i agree lol

[2:47:19] <+casy_fair> yesterday I looked up the definition of scion and the first two were: 1) a small budding plant, and 2) a person from a notable family. I thought that was interesting. the word scion gets thrown around kind of a lot in this game.
[2:47:23] <%hax_metatron> That hand holding the statue is part of his armor
[2:47:26] <%CateHecate> Undead Hunter D

[2:48:07] <+tempestzephyr> cradle

[2:48:22] <Louie_Salmon> Bronze?
[2:48:22] <tolloponik> he doesn't give the root oh now I'm really confused
[2:48:23] <ThatChainmecha> brass
[2:48:23] <+OniOniOniiii> he grippin back
[2:48:24] <XelanArdel> brass
[2:48:27] <%kimbucha> brass
[2:48:28] <Frazbeee> brass
[2:48:29] <+hoenhime344> brass
[2:48:29] <%RemedyofRevenge> bronze or brass
[2:48:29] <bonesonhigh> Brass is big in this game
[2:48:31] <Gnukko88> it's bronze/brass for the male and silver for the female part
[2:48:32] <+Javaa01> Brass
[2:48:33] <Gnukko88> it's so good
[2:48:37] <+PkSilent01> copper?
[2:48:39] <+ReallyBigRocks> That looks like brass
[2:48:39] <Gnukko88> LOOK AT THE DETAILS MMMMH BABY

[2:48:45] <derap41> burnished Brass
[2:48:45] <Gnukko88> the split in the leg
[2:48:46] <+Catpurnicus> same brass as the anor londo fire keeper
[2:48:46] <+tempestzephyr> extra feet
[2:48:48] <ThatChainmecha> copper is redder imo
[2:48:50] <zenith0111> D is a perfect blend of Miyazaki and GRRM
[2:48:51] <+Javaa01> Brass is a dull gold color
[2:48:52] <fecal_pap> dude looks awesome
[2:48:52] <bonesonhigh> I wish he was dressed like D tho
[2:48:52] <+froduck42> Brass and copper would be crappy armor
[2:48:53] <%AlteisenReiseZ> The mask is very Hellenistic
[2:48:53] <+0neReeler> armor is sex

[3:03:21] <QueequegTheater> @NBUsagi yes
[3:03:22] <%holydeviant1> It should be noted here: *until death

[3:03:38] <mrtanaka111> ember ring

[3:03:48] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus You talking about the two faced witch that gave you the bell for summoning?
[3:03:48] <+Drigoooooo> we found the elden ring boys
[3:03:56] <+KingpinLarry> I never bought the arc is it a permanent buff?
[3:03:56] <Gnukko88> are those nun.chucks?
[3:03:57] <%funya_rinpa> i didn't realize how good these were until i stopped being lazy and activated godrick's rune
[3:03:57] <ThatChainmecha> OOOOH ELDEN RING
[3:04:04] <zenith0111> Worth buying tbh
[3:04:05] <Gnukko88> 4th of the 3rd row?
[3:04:06] <%holydeviant1> @darkfoxxs Literally 'turns on' an empowered Great Rune. You get your first from Godrick.
[3:04:07] <%edgeroth> the rune arc lasts until you die
[3:04:12] <%hax_metatron> You won't need Rune Arcs until you beat a major boss so don't worry for now
[3:04:13] <+OniOniOniiii> why dont they just get a new ring if the old one broke
[3:04:15] <+Arnoldoaad1> I dont like the Grand Rune system here, I have yet to use one

[3:04:18] <ThatChainmecha> FIGERS BUT HOLE
[3:04:20] <%shakespearo> @Gnukko88 no it's a charm for summoning, sadly

[3:04:33] <QueequegTheater> @Arnoldoaad1 Have you unlocked any of them
[3:04:41] <scrumbotime> Yep, one ring is "help me" one ring is "i'll help you"
[3:04:45] <+Nekros4442> @arnoldoaad1 why not? You get arcs from invading or assisting anyway
[3:04:50] <jacknerik> Is that a one time use thing?
[3:04:52] <@Solidus_113> you want that shit
[3:04:52] <%khalcipher> @Javaa01 wtf? i have not use them because i thought it was a temporery buff
[3:04:56] <+Deekman> one ring is call cops, other ring is I'm a cop

[3:05:18] <+Arnoldoaad1> @Arnoldoaad1 2 so far and 1 active, what i dont like is that I need to use an item to turn the power on and then i lose the buff on dead, it sucks
[3:05:18] <KaiserMario> Woolie loves his sluts
[3:05:20] <%holydeviant1> Three of them
[3:05:22] <+Javaa01> @khalcipher Yeah, fuckin use em, they're good
[3:05:23] <ThatChainmecha> brb
[3:05:29] <%RemedyofRevenge> 3 in stock
[3:05:33] <+darkfoxxs> Wait so the great tunes give you a bunch of tunes?
[3:05:39] <%shakespearo> it's just like humanity, but better
[3:05:39] <%okuriskyles> gotta get the runes gotta get the souls
[3:05:40] <toulon_somberjade> they're like missile expansions
[3:05:43] <%hax_metatron> You won't use it until you beat a major boss so don't worry for now
[3:05:43] <%edgeroth> there are a bunch of merchants that sell the key
[3:05:43] <+darkfoxxs> Runes
[3:05:49] <+Brassnarwhal> @arnoldoaad1 it's an ember from da3 but they made it a more complete mechanic
[3:05:52] <%americandrm> save till big boss
[3:05:53] <%hax_metatron> Don't worry about rune arcs for now IMO
[3:05:54] <bonesonhigh> Better when you have a great rune
[3:05:57] <+Nekros4442> @arnoldoaad1 i mean...its like any other buff consumable then. You lose those on death too
[3:06:00] <Johannen> Save em for later
[3:06:00] <koolkid1208> @WoolieVersus its for after defeating a demigod
[3:06:01] <theyseemerowling> Rune Arcs are consumible, right?
[3:06:08] <%Theycallmenerf> It is, but you gotta get a great rune.
[3:06:11] <bonesonhigh> yeah, and limited
[3:06:15] <%americandrm> save rune arc
[3:06:18] <bonesonhigh> akaik
[3:06:24] <+Brassnarwhal> @theyseemerowling yes, the best way to farm them is coop
[3:06:26] <agustorm123> Slighlty scrached your round table, Okay I smashed your round table
[3:06:34] <%edgeroth> you can use it without a great rune but they won't be as effective
[3:06:35] <theyseemerowling> @Brassnarwhal Thanks!
[3:06:46] <+Brassnarwhal> ofc
[3:06:47] <%Deasmeister> @theyseemerowling yeah and you can get them from invading for free
[3:07:00] <Johannen> No
[3:07:00] <%Namillus> not all of them
[3:07:05] <%Prevot> missing katana
[3:07:18] <+Brassnarwhal> missing club
[3:07:24] <theyseemerowling> @Deasmeister Cool!
[3:07:25] <Johannen> no broadsword
[3:07:31] <zenith0111> Any Axe mains?
[3:07:31] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:07:36] <+zaddyforever> once you figure out a boss, just put a sign outside a boss room to geg rune arcs. or kill rats.
[3:07:42] <Monkeyweed21> Switch axe move
[3:07:48] <+zaddyforever> wonder what the lore reason for rats having rune arcs is
[3:07:49] <+Brassnarwhal> @zenith0111 halberds are like longe axes
[3:07:55] <jumpyhugs> Kick!!
[3:07:55] <AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> @zenith0111 was until I found the greatsword at the first big encampment
[3:08:02] <theyseemerowling> Reggie
[3:08:03] <%slipdog> patches cave is the easiest rune arc farm ever as a summon
[3:08:04] <theyseemerowling> This is for you
[3:08:08] <AllenDeadman> super kick
[3:08:08] <Johannen> @zaddyforever same as in souls
[3:08:11] <theyseemerowling> Reggarth thirsts
[3:08:15] <theyseemerowling> For his kick
[3:08:20] <theyseemerowling> As does KICKS.
[3:08:22] <%shakespearo> rats eat people, people have runes, I guess
[3:08:23] <%RemedyofRevenge> @WoolieVersus do note that you can kick if you switch to empty fist
[3:08:24] <%Deasmeister> toothpick!
[3:09:00] <+Brassnarwhal> @remedyofrevenge i found a crossbow with kick on it, you could offhand it to kick right? or would you have to 2 hand it anyway?
[3:09:03] <zenith0111> Finger Seal is for Faiths
[3:09:05] <xxHungryxx> ✌️
[3:09:27] <+Javaa01> Slightly nerfed from what it was, but still very good
[3:09:40] <Louie_Salmon> Or just find No Skill by itself, and put it on any shield
[3:09:40] <Johannen> I am dissapointed by the Knight armor set in this game
[3:09:43] <xxHungryxx> Brass shield is where it's at
[3:09:44] <fecal_pap> you can manually apply the no skill to the shield if you want
[3:09:48] <%shakespearo> there was a 100 shield with no skill, but y'all didn't pick it up
[3:09:56] <+zaddyforever> @johannen so rune arcs are just in bodies then?
[3:10:00] <%khalcipher> farran?
[3:10:01] <+NekkedSnek> you can find "no skill" ashes of war and apply it to a shield too
[3:10:03] <wandelmilch> pretty close to Dark Souls 2
[3:10:05] <%shakespearo> at the camp with the two badasses
[3:10:14] <+Brassnarwhal> @louie_salmon good plan but there are many shields with no skill there is only one noskill ash of war as far as i know
[3:10:24] <NYCrownlessKing> he aint gonna read that @shakespearo
[3:10:28] <+zaddyforever> i mean yeah ig a bunch of rando bodies have em
[3:10:29] <Johannen> @zaddyforever It was all split and scuttered around
[3:10:32] <@Solidus_113> it's a talisman
[3:10:47] <zenith0111> Its to trick invaders
[3:10:50] <%shakespearo> @NYCrownlessKing hasn't stopped anyone before now has it lmao
[3:10:52] <Omenaire_> so invaders think youre the host
[3:10:53] <+Brassnarwhal> untrue rings
[3:10:54] <+Javaa01> Yeah fool invaders into thinking you're the important boy
[3:11:20] <%shakespearo> I haven't been invaded by a single humon yet
[3:11:32] <+Javaa01> @shakespearo Yeah cause you have to specifically opt into it
[3:11:36] <Johannen> Knight set is not fashion
[3:11:40] <Afroperonista> 3 guys with the same name and the mirrors? damn
[3:11:41] <%shakespearo> oh? where
[3:11:44] <zenith0111> @shakespearo Ive been invading people and I feel like a monster but I had to for a quest
[3:11:45] <%plsunbanmyacc> invading got butchered in this game
[3:11:49] <+eanscrale> Invading seems to be tied to coop again unfortunately
[3:12:00] <spaghettiweaver> that set is actually kinda good
[3:12:16] <+Brassnarwhal> @zenith0111 don't feel bad about it you always get a disadvantage when invading
[3:12:18] <+Javaa01> @shakespearo Use an item, Furling Finger Remedy
[3:12:18] <%hax_metatron> You don't
[3:12:20] <Gnukko88> i think it's the same thing as ashes
[3:12:22] <+Rigid_Digidi> its like ashes from ds3
[3:12:22] <Gnukko88> in dark souls3
[3:12:24] <%hax_metatron> Don't worry about it for now
[3:12:39] <%hax_metatron> You find bell bearings and give them to this NPC. That's it
[3:12:46] <Zourath> Invading is particularly rough between it being tied to coop, the open world, and the Merika statues next to boss rooms in most dungeons.
[3:12:47] <%shakespearo> @shakespearo ohhh, it's like going human then
[3:12:51] <NYCrownlessKing> invading has to be tied to co op cuz imagine they say peace out on u with a horse lol
[3:12:56] <%Deasmeister> Also I love for the blue sentinel stuff you dont have to sacrifice a ring slot anymore
[3:13:02] <theyseemerowling> Keys, woolie
[3:13:08] <NYCrownlessKing> and npc invaders u can use the horse so they had to set those rules
[3:13:12] <+Arnoldoaad1> I think its fine to explain this, bells are gotten if you kill the npcs, so this is to be able not lose those stores
[3:13:23] <+Javaa01> @shakespearo Yes, but lower cost since it's not tied to stats meaning the devs can just throw them at you
[3:13:25] <+Brassnarwhal> @deasmeister what? in 3 you didnt have to use a ring
[3:13:33] <+Arnoldoaad1> I found out just because I killed Patches by accident
[3:13:35] <%akajaybay> theres also aggressive enemies with bells that expand shops
[3:13:35] <NYCrownlessKing> well not always true cuz I killed one @arnoldoaad1
[3:13:38] <+darkfoxxs> Better off to use the small ones at lower levels anyway
[3:13:39] <+Rigid_Digidi> Don't you need two for the thing at the beginning?
[3:13:46] <theyseemerowling> @Rigid_Digidi Yes
[3:13:47] <NYCrownlessKing> and they dropped no bell
[3:13:48] <%shakespearo> @Rigid_Digidi ye
[3:13:57] <+Arnoldoaad1> @NYCrownlessKing depends of the NPC
[3:14:06] <%edgeroth> yeah I think you need 2 keys for the beginning statue
[3:14:21] <koolkid1208> @WoolieVersus the one by the begining requires 2 keys
[3:14:27] <theyseemerowling> Now he has two
[3:14:28] <%Theycallmenerf> I would just save your runes.
[3:14:28] <NYCrownlessKing> there's also an invader u can kill for a bell
[3:14:29] <kes009900> those pants look weirdly modern...
[3:14:33] <+Arnoldoaad1> @NYCrownlessKing If you kill patches for example the bell will give you access to his store still
[3:14:33] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:14:34] <NYCrownlessKing> @arnoldoaad1
[3:14:34] <%shakespearo> this game should really have a "recently picked up" tab
[3:14:39] <zenith0111> DMC buying NotLikeThis
[3:14:43] <Zourath> There's a few good invading spots though, like a certain fun dungeon everyone knows about in the stinky swamp, or an open world boss later on which you can invade during.
[3:14:45] <theyseemerowling> I could be wrong. It did say 2 held.
[3:14:48] <+Brassnarwhal> @koolkid1208 I don't think I've seen any that don't take 2

[3:22:01] <kingbreaker21> @NBUsagi Lol.
[3:22:01] <+Brassnarwhal> boring but necessary unfortunately
[3:22:03] <Omenaire_> hes just assigning them
[3:22:04] <theyseemerowling> @plsunbanmyacc That's the appropriate response.
[3:22:06] <%pi_in_the_sci> it's the same thing as the grace menu
[3:22:07] <koolkid1208> no its just the same as at agrace
[3:22:10] <@Solidus_113> no?
[3:22:13] <+Grayhammatter> no
[3:22:15] <Omenaire_> same as the grace menu
[3:22:15] <NBUsagi> @kingbreaker21 fully activated XD

[3:22:18] <+Javaa01> You do not upgrade Ashes of War

[3:22:25] <@Solidus_113> the overthink begins again LUL
[3:22:29] <+Brassnarwhal> you just assign the ashes
[3:22:37] <kingbreaker21> @NBUsagi I couldn't have put it any better myself, buddy.
[3:22:38] <koolkid1208> so you can use on more than one weapon
[3:22:40] <+Flunkorg> YEP
[3:22:47] <@Solidus_113> weapon arts
[3:22:50] <scrumbotime> Yep, its the double dribble
[3:22:51] <%akajaybay> these ashes are just ther weapon ones.
[3:22:53] <QueequegTheater> Weapon arts only
[3:22:56] <zenith0111> This is because you can technically only have 1 equipped unless you copy them
[3:23:00] <%akajaybay> but its if you want the same thing ont wo weapons
[3:23:02] <+lightbringrrrr> Summon Ashes and Ashes of War are different
[3:23:03] <+Nekros4442> this is so you dupe weapon arts so you can switch weapons but have the same special

[3:40:50] <dds333a> @zenith0111 nice
[3:40:57] <ChoculaUltra> iirc the only unparryable melee weapons in the game are maces/flails
[3:41:01] <ChoculaUltra> but I could be wrong
[3:41:17] <emptyantics> Albrich is doable
[3:41:17] <zenith0111> Oh you can parry heavys too

[3:42:46] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:42:46] <emptyantics> AWW YEAHH
[3:42:48] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[3:42:49] <@Menitta> I'm close to being able to use it
[3:42:49] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> that's a cool thing my sorcerer ass will never use
[3:42:49] <theyseemerowling> Faith build or not, you'll like seeing it
[3:42:50] <+robertoszek> @HeroToxiko solidus was being way less obtuse than me on that regard, chill
[3:42:52] <+ReallyBigRocks> big woolie item
[3:42:53] <NBUsagi> lol YOU THOUGHT
[3:42:56] <zenith0111> OTGs are not real in this
[3:43:00] <SaiyanShoto> The pata
[3:43:05] <zenith0111> The wakeup iframes are bs
[3:43:10] <+hoenhime344> why isnt woolie killing him?
[3:43:13] <emptyantics> La pata hedionda….
[3:43:16] <scrumbotime> you don't have the right to leave
[3:43:18] <+Jiggisnipe> he's exploring
[3:43:24] <%slipdog> @hoenhime344 O he don't have the right
[3:43:26] <%okuriskyles> o you don't have the right
[3:43:26] <dds333a> @hoenhime344 he's tried Kappa
[3:43:31] <grouchomarxy> as a faith build, cant wait to rock the pata
[3:43:38] <+zaddyforever> anyone going for a faith/int build? i’m thinking ab respeccing to try it
[3:43:38] <yukichocomilk> you don't have the right, o you don't have the right
[3:43:40] <NBUsagi> Jump attacks for the win?
[3:43:40] <+Das_Prints> Only two ways to leave this area, kill or die.
[3:43:45] <%HeroToxiko> @HeroToxiko he found it just as you sent the message, it was funny.
[3:43:45] <+scarman125> what's bullshit is the fact that everything in the game gets wake up I-frames except the player.
[3:43:48] <SaiyanShoto> Every time I look at that weapon I just read it as cipher foot LUL
[3:43:49] <+hoenhime344> so much bitch in his heart today
[3:43:52] <@Menitta> I'm I think 6 levels away for that thing
[3:44:03] <+KingpinLarry> being able to freely jump helped with this fight so much
[3:44:05] <@Solidus_113> gaming
[3:44:05] <+ReallyBigRocks> @scarman125 you are invincible on the ground
[3:44:17] <%HeroToxiko> @scarman125 horse gives iframes but you can't horse in multiplayer
[3:44:17] <+ReallyBigRocks> and you can roll out of it
[3:44:20] <emptyantics> 2h the sword since you won’t be blocking anything he throws at you x1dnslYES
[3:44:26] <mothdude> The worst part about this guy is how he's technically doable
[3:44:27] <zenith0111> @scarman125 Do the monster hunter thing and not roll cancel the wakeup
[3:44:28] <@Menitta> If I'm invincible on the ground...then why can I see it
[3:44:30] <+hoenhime344> @ReallyBigRocks i thought i saw pat get hit by an OTG last night
[3:44:45] <enerkaizer> @scarman125 Not just that. There are multiple bosses that just flatout input read you. add this to the insane damage bosses can dish out, and it doesn't make for fun bosses in the most part
[3:44:46] <NBUsagi> That spin move is death
[3:44:52] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> it's not impossible, just improbable
[3:44:56] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[3:44:58] <+Flunkorg> you got gud
[3:44:58] <+hoenhime344> it always been dooable
[3:44:58] <+twenty112> @ReallyBigRocks There's some bosses that would have something to say about that

[3:46:06] <+Vigonept> i just spammed combustion
[3:46:11] <nintega010> can you stop sips
[3:46:17] <%pi_in_the_sci> TWO-HAND
[3:46:20] <scrumbotime> I had a wizard dual with him, i LOVE how many Wizard Duals i've had in this game
[3:46:22] <zenith0111> @scarman125 Theres different wakeuo animations NotLikeThis its very not clear
[3:46:24] <%livlinn> No bets this time? woolieSMUG
[3:46:24] <+Flunkorg> @nintega010 if you hit them early enough, yes
[3:46:26] <SaiyanShoto> I was able to do it at a super low level so you can definitely do it
[3:46:27] <%RyTYoung> @nintega010 yeah
[3:46:32] <DigiDom> 2 hand
[3:46:41] <nintega010> ok. so it's really doable
[3:46:45] <+hoenhime344> sip blue again and spam
[3:46:48] <mothdude> beeg damage
[3:46:48] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> good damage already
[3:46:52] <NBUsagi> I wonder if you stay on him will he sip/
[3:46:52] <+Jiggisnipe> oh he's walking
[3:46:56] <Frostilk> @BlackermanZX 30 faith fist weapon, iirc
[3:47:00] <dds333a> damage
[3:47:09] <dds333a> but sips LUL
[3:47:10] <VJdarkworld> sippy
[3:47:17] <%americandrm> if you had slicer he probably would be dead
[3:47:20] <+OniOniOniiii> thirst
[3:47:20] <NBUsagi> Do you only have a certain number of cast or do you cast till your mp is out?
[3:47:21] <%holydeviant1> thankfully he doesn't get many sips
[3:47:21] <%hax_metatron> Good, they only heal once in this game.
[3:47:29] <dds333a> the eternal tug of war
[3:47:29] <%hax_metatron> Every NPC I met has healed just once
[3:47:33] <tolloponik> I'm really starting to love the delay spells because of these types of encounters
[3:47:37] <+Das_Prints> I think npc invaders only get one sip.
[3:47:42] <VJdarkworld> imagine how NPCs feel when the player can chug like 7 flasks monkaS
[3:47:44] <%americandrm> 3 sips
[3:47:51] <+Jiggisnipe> neutral jump nice
[3:47:55] <+KingpinLarry> you can get 2 hits in with that jump
[3:47:57] <mrtanaka111> jesus, 4 hours session nothing was done
[3:48:00] <@Menitta> I eventually got rid of the shield. It's really good but I'd rather learn the patterns more and dodge than block
[3:48:03] <mrtanaka111> never change woolie
[3:48:04] <+scarman125> when does this dude run out of FP?
[3:48:05] <+Vigonept> he downloaded you
[3:48:05] <+Jiggisnipe> he whiffed D:
[3:48:06] <SilverFaustX> lol
[3:48:08] <dds333a> INTERACTION
[3:48:09] <theyseemerowling> Cipher Pata
[3:48:09] <%MajorCrasher> LUL
[3:48:09] <%xerotwo> OOP AHH LUL
[3:48:11] <truegreed> Predicted monkaS
[3:48:15] <+robertoszek> nice try though
[3:48:15] <%RemedyofRevenge> this is so doable
[3:48:15] <@Solidus_113> that's a practice
[3:48:16] <+orochiblood> 'stop jumping at me'
[3:48:16] <agustorm123> The wall hiting hard
[3:48:18] <a_mad_dragon_> the reads
[3:48:18] <+Proxzo> Nice round. good mixup
[3:48:19] <AnthroMetal> god they improved the npc invaders so much since DS1
[3:48:20] <+SoeSpooky> AGAIN
[3:48:20] <+Flunkorg> @scarman125 Implying ai invaders can run out of FP
[3:48:24] <%RemedyofRevenge> and woolie could still level up his weapon too
[3:48:27] <nintega010> you just gotta stop that sip
[3:48:27] <VJdarkworld> una mas una mas
[3:48:30] <%Deasmeister> one more try!!
[3:48:35] <%espanishcanamurciana> Try courage!
[3:48:35] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> it IS doable, but he ain't free
[3:48:35] <+Das_Prints> Doable
[3:48:36] <+hoenhime344> @mrtanaka111 lol i know right, at least last session woolie wasent sucha biiiiiiiiitch ahahahahahaha
[3:48:39] <%riffsofdylheim> ...
[3:48:39] <+robertoszek> buff engaged
[3:48:39] <+KingpinLarry> @scarman125 when he's dead and done
[3:48:41] <%holydeviant1> Mou ikkai!
[3:48:42] <DeathByPoke7> one more one more
[3:48:44] <ChoculaUltra> there was this one thread on the subreddit complaining about "getting invaded by the same guy again and again" in Roundtable hold
[3:48:52] <%Reveresao> you can backstab him as he always does the bow
[3:48:54] <dds333a> TATAKAE
[3:49:08] <zenith0111> Zoner Wars
[3:49:18] <+OniOniOniiii> i jump heavy that blood stab to punish him
[3:49:23] <@Menitta> I really wish I did int instead of faith after seeing so many magic spells

[4:01:54] <%adamisbarely3d> the tongue of "come at me bro"
[4:01:54] <NYCrownlessKing> ohhh
[4:01:57] <NYCrownlessKing> kk
[4:01:57] <+Das_Prints> Pvp Rumble tongue
[4:01:58] <+Jiggisnipe> @NYCrownlessKing I believe he picked it up in the side room of the arena
[4:01:58] <%Gruhunchously> tongue and fingers Kappa
[4:02:00] <+Flunkorg> Wrong. 1 vs 2.
[4:02:07] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[4:02:08] <NYCrownlessKing> gotcha
[4:02:08] <BlackermanZX> yeyeyeye
[4:02:10] <dds333a> Meta discovered
[4:02:10] <Frostilk> LUL
[4:02:12] <NBUsagi> lol
[4:02:13] <+Walopoh> try tongue but hole
[4:02:17] <+GelatinBoi> LUL
[4:02:18] <%Gruhunchously> bro
[4:02:18] <KaiserMario> Pata pata pata pon
[4:02:18] <NBUsagi> Protoss builds incoming
[4:02:19] <zenith0111> LUL
[4:02:22] <%RyTYoung> LUL
[4:02:27] <enerkaizer> so, apperently, the wrist mounted lightsabers need INT to work, according to other players
[4:02:31] <Nitsuj293> I use that place for testing weapons now
[4:02:32] <+Flunkorg> Who knew that church was so cool?!?!
[4:02:35] <tubit> @Flunkorg didn't it say it reduced the amount of cooperators to one?
[4:02:36] <%Juriasu> Woolie is a man of faith
[4:02:37] <+Vigonept> int faith is viable
[4:02:38] <+0neReeler> no ring
[4:02:40] <@Solidus_113> summon swords or god
[4:02:41] <@Solidus_113> pick
[4:02:45] <theyseemerowling> "The Catholic Church. We've made a few... changes."
[4:02:51] <+ReallyBigRocks> everything is viable in this game
[4:02:54] <dds333a> @theyseemerowling LUL
[4:02:56] <bonesonhigh> I'm doing Faith Strength, it's bretty gud
[4:02:58] <%edgeroth> I love how that weapon is just down there and you can get it immediately
[4:03:01] <@Menitta> what level is he at
[4:03:02] <bonesonhigh> Fire strong
[4:03:05] <+cursedwithadhd> everything is coming
[4:03:06] <NBUsagi> Bruh if being devout also included holy armblades, id be way more down
[4:03:11] <+Flunkorg> @Flunkorg No, it removes the amount of co-operators. Its just worded odd. So this basically forces you to take ganks essentially.
[4:03:13] <%Prevot> you can have your melee weapons scale with the magic stats
[4:03:15] <+Javaa01> The good thing, with those new things that are coming, so is respec
[4:03:19] <+SaintSalted> i only leveled faith after finding like the 10nth dope ass faith weapon
[4:03:24] <+Walopoh> Anti-Holy
[4:03:26] <yukichocomilk> i got a weapon that made me respec from dex/faith to dex/int instantly LUL
[4:03:28] <+GelatinBoi> This was also when I started looking at Faith and regretting going heavy INT
[4:03:36] <+eanscrale> faith also has fire and lighting
[4:03:38] <linSP> Look every build has nice things
[4:03:43] <@Menitta> that's a good incantation
[4:03:44] <+orochiblood> @yukichocomilk the vergil sword huh
[4:03:47] <%MajorCrasher> idk why every souls game doesn't come with respect after ds2
[4:03:47] <+Flunkorg> @linSP Except pure str
[4:03:47] <dds333a> @linsp TRUTH
[4:03:51] <QueequegTheater> @yukichocomilk There's a lot more str/faith and dex/int synergy than the opposite
[4:03:51] <yukichocomilk> @orochiblood hell yeah
[4:03:56] <%MajorCrasher> Respec*
[4:03:59] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:03:59] <+SaintSalted> remember woolie, int/dex=vergil
[4:04:00] <%Deasmeister> And pyro is now faith too
[4:04:01] <NBUsagi> They really diversified the elemental magic you get, fire and lightning was dope but it got old
[4:04:04] <QueequegTheater> @linSP >He didn't find the sword of swords
[4:04:08] <DSD24> Nice khaki pants Woolie
[4:04:11] <%Prevot> eeeeh STR weaponsmare kinda basic always
[4:04:11] <derap41> Strength and Faith go hand in had
[4:04:11] <+Das_Prints> They really front load a lot of cool stuff for faith. Seems like it takes more doing to find the cool int stuff.
[4:04:11] <+OniOniOniiii> my second playthrough is def goin faith, for now my brain must grow 5Head
[4:04:15] <sporeian94> Woolie... I saw that icon under your health bar... you've been hugging anime girls again haven't ya!?
[4:04:15] <@Menitta> level 26 ok
[4:04:19] <ppangboi> @linSP the GRRM weapon
[4:04:21] <%americandrm> spells
[4:04:22] <nintega010> the str weapon is gutz
[4:04:22] <NBUsagi> @DSD24 lol i didnt want to say anything XD
[4:04:23] <+theoldone001> Moonveil alone is worth Int, but Faith has some cool ass shit so I respec'c to Faith
[4:04:28] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Don't tell Woolie about the INT Katana Kappa
[4:04:29] <+ApocalypticExpress> I'm sticking to int cuz I was told about a cool ass int wep I wanna go for
[4:04:34] <+zaddyforever> it’s really interesting how there’s multiple branches of magic in all different types
[4:04:34] <+ReallyBigRocks> @DSD24 Woolsworth from IT
[4:04:35] <QueequegTheater> @sporeian94 SHUT UP
[4:04:37] <+Flunkorg> @Prevot Dmg wise str is probably the worst build archetype but a long mile.
[4:04:39] <%americandrm> wait till you see the spells
[4:04:43] <%Prevot> @alteisenreisez pat already did
[4:04:45] <%Juriasu> they still
[4:04:50] <zenith0111> Theyre dead dead
[4:04:50] <+Javaa01> They are very much husks
[4:04:50] <+zaddyforever> like i’ve been finding different types of faith/int spells that work completely different
[4:04:51] <+Nekros4442> husks
[4:04:52] <theyseemerowling> They do be husky
[4:04:56] <scrumbotime> sliiiiiightly moving
[4:04:56] <NBUsagi> mummified
[4:04:57] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @Prevot aww dagnabit
[4:05:03] <+solzan2000> husky asf
[4:05:14] <+orochiblood> STR as fun as it is now, it took forever to become fun.
[4:05:26] <koolkid1208> @WoolieVersus make sure to go talk to the Santa merchant back at the church
[4:05:37] <QueequegTheater> Oh my god Chat
[4:05:39] <+Flunkorg> @orochiblood Even late game the amount of viable weapons is very small. It sucks.
[4:05:42] <QueequegTheater> stop backseating
[4:05:43] <theyseemerowling> XD
[4:05:47] <+orochiblood> STR needs some serious numbers to become fun, at least to me
[4:05:49] <theyseemerowling> Poor Queequeg
[4:05:55] <mrtanaka111> stats all over the place
[4:06:02] <Nitsuj293> STR is honestly suffering while watching everyone elses builds come together
[4:06:08] <%MajorCrasher> DO IT
[4:06:12] <%radiorosewater> @QueequegTheater you really cant catch a break huh
[4:06:13] <NBUsagi> I really got to give this game props, alot of Souls games really only worked with on build but you can feel they wanted everything viable in this
[4:06:16] <%edgeroth> this is such a cool hub
[4:06:22] <+SaintSalted> ngl pure quality is a clowns build in this
[4:06:24] <+Flunkorg> @orochiblood The only viable way to use strength I found is to pair with GS and tons of poise but then why not just dex with a spear?
[4:06:27] <+SaintSalted> good fucking luck with end game
[4:06:30] <%Prevot> STR has had it goo for too long, let the rest of the class have fun for once
[4:06:37] <+OniOniOniiii> the start was a fun first challenge, i started with the key for a gift
[4:06:41] <bonesonhigh> key
[4:06:41] <Louie_Salmon> This should be funny
[4:06:43] <%slipdog> dung ahead
[4:06:47] <+orochiblood> thats why i respec'd to dex/int and became medieval vergil
[4:06:48] <+sambws> You can use the stone key there
[4:06:57] <tolloponik> who forgot the keys to the kitchen?!
[4:06:58] <@Menitta> Quality is the boring basic bread build
[4:06:59] <%セビー> that first key dungeon.. mannnn
[4:06:59] <mothdude> Four Keys.....
[4:07:00] <+Flunkorg> @Prevot Doesn't mean we should make STR THIS bad
[4:07:01] <reinhardtvalkyr> second one requires two tho
[4:07:01] <zenith0111> @saintsalted Im trying so hard to make it work but like no weapons are good for it
[4:07:07] <+robertoszek> key mind goblins, literally
[4:07:11] <+mechslayer71> STR has been working for me. also been running faith
[4:07:12] <QueequegTheater> @Prevot STR is still fine
[4:07:14] <CapCasual> Nice.
[4:07:15] <scrumbotime> ....i just remembered I have like, 4 keys rattling around, i should open up that basement
[4:07:16] <+0neReeler> gacha door
[4:07:17] <%Juriasu> there is a chest in the first room too
[4:07:21] <%Juriasu> and it's good
[4:07:24] <%edgeroth> str faith is very fun
[4:07:24] <%slipdog> STR? Bad? Strike damage is extra effective against sooo many enemy types and you have so many to choose from
[4:07:29] <@Menitta> it feels like you gotta go half on something.
[4:07:29] <QueequegTheater> Charged R2 -> Charged R2 staggers almost everything
[4:07:30] <DSD24> I'm going quality faith
[4:07:31] <%slipdog> I'm str/fth
[4:07:32] <+SaintSalted> @zenith0111 bloudhound curved is really strong but summons and magic are king for later game fight
[4:07:33] <+Flunkorg> @mechslayer71 That second part is the important part. PURE str has a lot of problems.
[4:07:36] <+OniOniOniiii> i have been getting keys pretty much around the time i find new gattes
[4:07:36] <%Irridium> @Prevot it's true I'm dual-wielding the greatsword and zweihander and shit FUCKS
[4:07:40] <%Juriasu> perhaps it could be something like that Kapa
[4:07:50] <@Menitta> be it str Dex with int/faith/arcane
[4:08:02] <dds333a> LUL
[4:08:02] <+ReallyBigRocks> everything is good in it's own way, this game is surprisingly balanced for all the shit in it
[4:08:06] <+mechslayer71> @flunkorg what would that be? the one boss that's been a problem is big gravity boi
[4:08:07] <+tempestzephyr> it's zanarkand
[4:08:08] <%edgeroth> very cool hub
[4:08:11] <+Flunkorg> @slipdog Again, you're confusing your build for pure str builds that lack everything faith has.
[4:08:13] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> oh we going there again?
[4:08:14] <%holydeviant1> I dare you to ride south woolie
[4:08:15] <zenith0111> @saintsalted Ive been getting carried by Square Off
[4:08:16] <ChoculaUltra> went all in with a 70 int build with an int scaling katana and never looked back
[4:08:17] <%holydeviant1> I daaare you
[4:08:25] <%slipdog> @slipdog nah the weapons are good sorry lol
[4:08:27] <bonesonhigh> this is Gurranq
[4:08:28] <@Menitta> oh no did he get Isekai'd here
[4:08:33] <yukichocomilk> oh there's PLENTY of magic stuff don't worry
[4:08:37] <NYCrownlessKing> map got bigger
[4:08:39] <%holydeviant1> need item
[4:08:39] <NBUsagi> Homie snarling
[4:08:40] <NYCrownlessKing> oh boi
[4:08:41] <KaiserMario> You need a thing
[4:08:47] <%akajaybay> oh did they encounter the marienr and all that?
[4:08:47] <iacus_> did you get the thing?
[4:08:49] <ChoculaUltra> he's just vibing
[4:08:50] <%AyotoCorp> Need a different kind of key
[4:08:51] <theyseemerowling> Come back to him later
[4:08:53] <+Cactuskris> dont got the right u dont got
[4:08:55] <+Flunkorg> @mechslayer71 Its less that you can't beat the game with str only, you absolutely can. But every other build type does something like 2-5x more damage at the same rate.
[4:08:55] <iacus_> you need to hunt a big undead
[4:08:56] <dds333a> Sleepy boy
[4:08:57] <+OniOniOniiii> @yukichocomilk i believe
[4:08:58] <+Javaa01> Perhaps later
[4:08:58] <bonesonhigh> @akajaybay Not yet
[4:08:58] <zenith0111> He a growly boi
[4:09:00] <%Plesin> mans needs more death
[4:09:01] <%Juriasu> Vampire hunter D didn't show the thing?
[4:09:02] <DSD24> "Beast Grunt"
[4:09:04] <%akajaybay> how'd they get here?
[4:09:15] <bonesonhigh> @akajaybay They randomly found the gate
[4:09:15] <KaiserMario> Woolie got here without talking to D
[4:09:16] <+mechslayer71> @flunkorg which ones? magic stuff?
[4:09:16] <SarcFa> @akajaybay they found a teleporter thing
[4:09:22] <+ReallyBigRocks> @akajaybay portal in Limgrave that drops you out front
[4:09:22] <%Prevot> what, you were gonna jam the key into him?
[4:09:23] <theyseemerowling> Don't say dog
[4:09:26] <ChoculaUltra> Time for head?
[4:09:27] <%AyotoCorp> @Juriasu I don't think they did the thing to get the thing to SHOW to D
[4:09:28] <%セビー> i got teleported to.. calied? and ive just been wandering around a surreal landscape in a daze
[4:09:31] <zenith0111> @juriasu Stumbled on the portal by accident

[4:10:17] <+mechslayer71> @flunkorg I'd be interested to see these builds. I feel like my damage output with my strength stuff is pretty good
[4:10:17] <KaiserMario> LUL, it takes two
[4:10:18] <+Vigonept> its the 2nd one
[4:10:23] <theyseemerowling> @styptysat 10/10

[4:20:02] <%Pillagius> @mrtanaka111 So Miyazaki is an Ohre?
[4:20:04] <ChoculaUltra> are swamps even native to Japan? wonder what swamp Miyazaki visited and was like "I love'em"

[4:21:23] <%Intersceptre> Intersceptre subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 36 months! What do you mean I paid for 3 years of this and he can't afford better trash to emerge out of in the intro?
[4:21:23] <Dopamien> tbf this game is easy on swamps, they dont slow you down to a crawl
[4:21:37] <@Menitta> Are white phantoms real time or no
[4:21:43] <%slipdog> i think the shallow lake that you can just gallop across is so cool
[4:21:45] <+0neReeler> helmet is like magneto's
[4:21:49] <%americandrm> yes
[4:21:51] <QueequegTheater> @Menitta I think so
[4:21:53] <%Bread_Assassin> Swamps aren't that bad because you can just Torrent through them.
[4:21:55] <%americandrm> it's a race
[4:21:57] <@Menitta> Aw cool
[4:22:01] <%americandrm> another jump

[4:22:18] <@Menitta> who made this thing
[4:22:19] <Nitsuj293> this place is so BS for being available from the start
[4:22:19] <stevenellis386> is this chariot moving faster?
[4:22:25] <@Menitta> for what purpose
[4:22:36] <Dopamien> love these bs trap dungeons tho, they're wild
[4:22:37] <KaiserMario> Reggies onto something

[4:23:22] <%americandrm> you was supposed to jump
[4:23:29] <%Bread_Assassin> This section really punishes you for being TOO careful.
[4:23:30] <%slipdog> dashing through required ahead, therefore, try nimble sort
[4:23:31] <%americandrm> before he comes back down
[4:23:33] <QueequegTheater> Too late now
[4:23:36] <+Arnoldoaad1> you will never out run it, you know that

[4:24:11] <SaintBeau> you just gotta book it
[4:24:12] <BlackermanZX> is that a safe drop
[4:24:13] <mrtanaka111> when did mississipi replace seconds
[4:24:15] <@Menitta> "Do a flip"
[4:24:15] <%セビー> we saw the sparks as he dodged

[4:24:47] <mrtanaka111> if you jump early you can do it
[4:24:49] <SoaringTrumpet> This early trap fortress  is about the level of trolling I expected from From
[4:24:50] <dds333a> labbing the distance
[4:24:52] <KaiserMario> Some people might have missed that

[4:37:18] <@Menitta> I just wanna say I never got in on a Fromsoft game day 1 before and honestly watching you guys go through Elden Ring alongside my own playthrough and everyone else, it really is a special experience.
[4:37:18] <%oneimportantthing> Woolie really just waited for it to catch up and then ran out
[4:37:22] <Zayasu> where is this dungeon?
[4:37:24] <+OrangeMDT> @kevlarkoala I remember someone saying, “if you fight this above lvl 21 you’re weaker than Pat” or something
[4:37:25] <WeepyDevil> any of the physically inclined starting classes could do this
[4:37:35] <dds333a> @menitta that was me and BB
[4:37:36] <+hoenhime344> can you aattack it and break it?
[4:37:38] <theyseemerowling> @oneimportantthing Chivalry is alive and well
[4:37:45] <%セビー> @zayasu outside the stranded graveyard
[4:37:47] <%edgeroth> @zayasu this is right at the beginning area right after you create your character
[4:37:50] <WeepyDevil> everyone except astrologer, prophet, bandit
[4:37:51] <kevlarkoala> @weepydevil lmao I'm fine being weaker than a masochist LUL
[4:38:00] <@Menitta> I did play BB day 1 but I never talked to anyone about it and took years to beat it
[4:38:03] <penitentpendant> Torrent: "Neigh. I ain't helpin' you with this."
[4:38:03] <BlackermanZX> "fuck u im not paid enough for this"
[4:38:05] <tolloponik> Torrent: Fuck that Brother!!
[4:38:09] <OldManDeckardCain> I have seen someone beat this at lvl 1 LUL
[4:38:12] <WeepyDevil> well, could kill these enemies
[4:38:17] <+kurosaru> If he goes to the archer side first, will he lure the swordsman into the trap?
[4:38:17] <DedlokPM> Incidentally: paucsing that clip to view it slowly: one of the guys did a disappearing/teleporting thing RIGHT before the wheel hit him
[4:38:24] <WeepyDevil> the puzzle is down to the player
[4:38:32] <stevenellis386> that kick takes a chunk off you...
[4:38:32] <%espanishcanamurciana> Haha Reggie do more torrent impersonating
[4:38:33] <%Jakeofalco> @tolloponik NotLikeThis LUL
[4:38:50] <+cubbywolf> lol
[4:38:51] <sun312772> worm ahead
[4:39:03] <%セビー> you could sprint almost the whole way on a headstart, thats what i did on accident
[4:39:10] <coziestbank> There's a second half of the dungeon that's easy to miss. Where the hall narrows, you need to intentionally drop down.
[4:39:10] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[4:40:53] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus But that drop woolie, it didn't lead here...
[4:40:56] <souptrader> i like to imagine torrent’s just been eating popcorn
[4:40:56] <%edgeroth> @coziestbank ooo cool thanks for the info

[4:41:00] <%specters_art88> He’s about to get wrecked
[4:41:10] <Frostilk> I accidentally got the thing here stuck after half hp bar and just hit it until it died csbeastSetIn
[4:41:11] <bobbyratlair> This is not a good boss to fight this early but we'll see
[4:41:21] <dds333a> What do you say. join me!
[4:41:23] <+scarman125> wait where is he going LUL
[4:41:25] <%セビー> @frostilk lucky
[4:41:31] <zenith0111> The chariot is alive I swear
[4:41:31] <+sevorai> How tf you get it stuck??
[4:41:37] <BlackermanZX> why go up
[4:41:40] <+charp35> The stake only works when you die near it you know
[4:41:46] <+Captain_sevatar> I think he wants to check that bridge
[4:41:47] <BlackermanZX> oh
[4:41:48] <%Bread_Assassin> @bobbyratlair Pat managed to beat it at around this point.
[4:41:48] <%akajaybay> the statue spawn is distance based so if you get up there it wont count
[4:41:52] <warlordpr> @scarman125 more exploring to be had. more items
[4:41:55] <The_Grand_J> mm, you giving me scary gong this far from the statue
[4:41:59] <%Deasmeister> If you go away from marika stake it doesnt spawn you back there
[4:42:00] <+yeknomlive> oh dear
[4:42:01] <bobbyratlair> @bobbyratlair whos pat?
[4:42:03] <%ArtemisCroc> @charp35 no he doesn't seem to understand how they work lol
[4:42:12] <SaintBeau> ur playin w fire woolie
[4:42:13] <+robertoszek> the hud does tell you when you're no longer in the stake of marika's zone of influence
[4:42:13] <dds333a> ayy
[4:42:13] <+cubbywolf> rump a pum pum
[4:42:17] <+OniOniOniiii> no rump?
[4:42:19] <JoviLovesYou> Bout to be teleported back to the entrance LUL
[4:42:29] <FrostedZaibatsu> No torch?
[4:42:30] <%akajaybay> but it seems likeely the game would hide something on the up ramp too
[4:42:30] <Deko_> oooooh
[4:42:33] <dds333a> there you go
[4:42:37] <SoaringTrumpet> eureka
[4:42:53] <+vaderxyz1970> You know when I first did this dungeon I hated it but now it is my favorite
[4:42:55] <%Bread_Assassin> @bobbyratlair Another streamer who Woolie cohosts a podcast with.
[4:42:55] <+ReallyBigRocks> shit I never saw that
[4:43:00] <tolloponik> ok thats really doable now
[4:43:01] <+cubbywolf> the waiting
[4:43:03] <+scarman125> oh shit I never knew you could do that
[4:43:03] <mothdude> Wow that's a neat shortcut
[4:43:10] <+darkfoxxs> I didn’t know there was a boss here smh I gotta go back
[4:43:18] <FrostedZaibatsu> I didnt even know about this shortcut
[4:43:19] <%jvilly96> yup

[4:43:33] <+ReallyBigRocks> :O strats
[4:43:35] <+robertoszek> @bobbyratlair it doesn't ring a bell
[4:43:38] <sun312772> since paige pat and you are streaming right no are you going to do jolly cooperation ?
[4:43:57] <%Bread_Assassin> @bobbyratlair Am I missing a bit?
[4:44:10] <BlackermanZX> pretty sure paige is like 50 hours ahead
[4:44:15] <+scarman125> I don't know what platform Woolie is playing on but aren't Pat and Paige on different platforms?
[4:44:18] <%oneimportantthing> So does this Chariot run on fuel or what
[4:44:31] <%ArtemisCroc> magic I would assume
[4:44:35] <+pectusumbra> Can you kill that guy with magic?
[4:44:36] <+vaderxyz1970> @oneimportantthing The blood of crushed tarnished
[4:44:36] <dds333a> hoofin'
[4:44:37] <%ArtemisCroc> since this is magical world lmao
[4:44:39] <WeepyDevil> @sun312772 most of them are all anti-co op anyways
[4:44:43] <@Solidus_113> it runs on spite
[4:44:46] <theyseemerowling> @scarman125 Pat's on PS5, Paige on PC. Don't know about Woolie, but maybe PS5 as well?
[4:44:51] <@Menitta> it runs on the power of sp- damnit
[4:44:54] <%MajorCrasher> @oneimportantthing it runs on Miyazaki's spite
[4:44:55] <WeepyDevil> woolies ps5 now
[4:44:56] <tolloponik> @oneimportantthing it runs on salt and  Spite
[4:44:58] <souptrader> he’s on ps5 now i believe

[4:46:46] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[4:46:48] <WeepyDevil> well, dunno about Paige i guess, i'm just kind of assuming she shares pats proclivities
[4:46:48] <+pectusumbra> I doubt anyone is going to co-op until they've beaten the game by themselves first
[4:46:50] <+scarman125> this guy is gonna spank
[4:46:50] <%akajaybay> yeah i missed this fella
[4:46:50] <tolloponik> is that the origin of the curse?!
[4:46:50] <stevenellis386> you should say hi
[4:46:51] <%oneimportantthing> And now FIGHT THIS FUCKER
[4:46:54] <+darkfoxxs> Just grab the item and dip lmao

[4:46:57] <Frostilk> there's a real lack of bloodstain around here
[4:46:58] <Iza_kku> idk what that item is, but get that first
[4:47:00] <FrostedZaibatsu> YEAH zone his ass
[4:47:00] <theyseemerowling> It'll never happen, but given that Plague is playing this too, it would be a great time for a DS2 rematch
[4:47:00] <iacus_> are you crestfallen, warrior?

[4:48:05] <BlueEagle2395> nice job on the keel
[4:48:05] <+ReallyBigRocks> Kreygasm more faith
[4:48:13] <FrostedZaibatsu> I lured him out and let the roller kill him
[4:48:14] <+pectusumbra> grease is consumable
[4:48:14] <%adamisbarely3d> i thought that said dragon communism
[4:48:17] <%HeroToxiko> Thats what happens when you go up?
[4:48:17] <%Th3SmartAlec> Weapon / charm
[4:48:20] <xxHungryxx> This unwashed chat has plenty of grease
[4:48:20] <Frazbeee> usbale item
[4:48:23] <%akajaybay> oh the cast tool for faith
[4:48:24] <+scarman125> I'm honestly still surprised that they rolled Pyromancy in with Faith
[4:48:26] <+yeknomlive> it's a faith catalyst
[4:48:32] <+cubbywolf> rope. it's a rope
[4:48:35] <KaiserMario> Grease is consumable, Seal is weapon
[4:48:40] <QueequegTheater> Rope. It's made of rope.
[4:48:44] <+scarman125> as a faith user I'm definitely not complaining. DS2 still hurts...
[4:48:51] <dds333a> Woolie has been BLESSED by neutral jump R2
[4:49:02] <+justianxix> LUL
[4:49:06] <+yeknomlive> dragoon spec
[4:49:10] <theyseemerowling> another reason to go faith
[4:49:17] <KaiserMario> no
[4:49:18] <kinkade_77> Nope that’s the spell
[4:49:19] <+BDazl> Sign me up for that dragon life
[4:49:20] <@Solidus_113> not quite
[4:49:21] <morkelebmink> also dragon arms
[4:49:21] <+darkfoxxs> Fairy Tail now
[4:49:22] <+cubbywolf> that's not what you daw
[4:49:22] <%Deasmeister> nope
[4:49:23] <mrtanaka111> no
[4:49:23] <KaiserMario> Incorrect
[4:49:23] <+mechslayer71> just found another area like this. but even worse NotLikeThis
[4:49:24] <TheCrispyBoi> no
[4:49:25] <+ReallyBigRocks> that's not specific to this
[4:49:27] <+vaderxyz1970> Become a dragon slayer from Fairy Tail
[4:49:29] <+HolyMANperor> It is NOT
[4:49:32] <Afroperonista> especially against living things
[4:49:33] <The_Grand_J> that dragon communion
[4:49:33] <%ArtemisCroc> this can cast any incantation
[4:49:34] <moonbearbacon> wrong it enhances that
[4:49:35] <+justianxix> Dragon stand
[4:49:38] <QueequegTheater> Woolie wants everything to be Stands
[4:49:38] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus It's a incantation catalyst
[4:49:44] <%edgeroth> it's a catalyst that enchances the dragon spell
[4:49:47] <+Proxzo> nope. it's a type of seal for incantations. but this one converts arcane to damage
[4:49:53] <+cubbywolf> woolie: I seent  it. chat; nope
[4:49:53] <dds333a> @afroperonista IT'S FORREST, OH MY COD
[4:49:59] <theyseemerowling> If Hermit Purple is a Stand, this can be a Stand
[4:50:03] <+Captain_sevatar> Woolie did a pat
[4:50:16] <theyseemerowling> The incantation, I mean, not the seal
[4:50:20] <KaiserMario> This works for other incantations, not just dragons
[4:50:24] <BlackermanZX> but can you summon blue eyes white dragon
[4:50:26] <linSP> Faithbros win again

[4:50:55] <%Shad0wTag> @huskarl_zap It says drakes so maybe bad
[4:50:58] <+pectusumbra> grease is a consumable

[4:51:00] <Afroperonista> so he does read chat? LUL
[4:51:03] <dds333a> I love it LUL
[4:51:06] <QueequegTheater> Useable
[4:51:06] <+cubbywolf> go inside and touch grase

[4:51:07] <+Jiggisnipe> chat can't help themselves., must always correct

[4:51:13] <+Sir_Louis> DRAGON DRAGON ROCK THE DRAGON
[4:51:14] <+Jiggisnipe> @Afroperonista yes he does
[4:51:18] <warlordpr> its not faith chat, its arcane
[4:51:19] <Afroperonista> bad idea LUL
[4:51:26] <dds333a> @sir_louis DRAGON BALL Z
[4:51:26] <Dopamien> he got thing wrong REEEEEEE
[4:51:28] <mothdude> hmmm
[4:51:28] <%TueDuffCity> Chat should get discipline lesson
[4:51:29] <stevenellis386> huh
[4:51:33] <+cubbywolf> stone skales
[4:51:34] <Nitsuj293> >stone scales
[4:51:40] <+SaintSalted> huh
[4:51:41] <+Proxzo> It
[4:51:41] <xxHungryxx> Damnit Sseth
[4:51:43] <+vaderxyz1970> They are now all Seathe
[4:51:43] <QueequegTheater> stone scalse monkaS
[4:51:43] <+Flunkorg> oh, so they all have no scales
[4:51:44] <zenith0111> Its literally a dark souls
[4:51:47] <morkelebmink> dark souls confirmed in same universe
[4:51:48] <megaman_sentinel> damn seath you f*** these dragons too
[4:51:51] <DickHardly> Love greases in this game
[4:51:57] <+Proxzo> Interesting item. Converts Arcane to Damage for incants.
[4:52:00] <+scarman125> of course they had Stone Scales LUL
[4:52:00] <@Menitta> touch grease
[4:52:03] <dds333a> How does it feel, Elden Seath
[4:52:06] <+BDazl> touch grease
[4:52:08] <%akajaybay> there seems be a number of faith spell seals that focus on a particular branch of spells. on top that this one is also arcane scaled.
[4:52:11] <+cubbywolf> turn into a dragon woolie
[4:52:11] <spaghettiweaver> weapon buffs look tasty...
[4:52:11] <theyseemerowling> Yo, we heard you hate dragons. So here's some dragons so you can fight dragons.
[4:52:21] <+darkfoxxs> Boss time?
[4:52:28] <+cubbywolf> that was wind stomp wasn't it?
[4:52:31] <xxHungryxx> Seath, the self-hating dragon
[4:52:31] <+pectusumbra> I assume that'd be an ash of war if it exists
[4:52:39] <+cubbywolf> also the teliport is because it was a ghost
[4:52:47] <coziestbank> The bloodhounds's dash?
[4:52:56] <+Captain_sevatar> teleporting enemies are super fun
[4:53:09] <+pectusumbra> that said a sorcery that turns your roll into a ghost-bamf for a bit would be fucking sick
[4:53:10] <+scarman125> does the scaling actually effect spells at all?
[4:53:14] <moonbearbacon> i like that its a chariot
[4:53:25] <%ArtemisCroc> @scarman125 yes? why wouldn't it?
[4:53:34] <coziestbank> Most dragon stuff is status effects, status effects are stronger with higher arcane.

[4:54:16] <%akajaybay> so there's seals that suck at the more general spells, but are real good at these specific ones.
[4:54:17] <+OniOniOniiii> imps will give me a herat attack once in this game
[4:54:17] <+Das_Prints> Well that explains all the bloodstains.
[4:54:21] <tubit> these "goblins" are so great
[4:54:21] <coziestbank> There's no surviving the room with the tailisman, that's a run and gun.
[4:54:22] <xxHungryxx> NOTICING THE BLOOD STAINS
[4:54:23] <DedlokPM> @Frazbeee dungeon right by where you start the game

[4:54:50] <%Juriasu> stone is hard to cut
[4:54:53] <%セビー> imps are such fuckers
[4:54:53] <warlordpr> counter hit+repost kills them one shot
[4:54:54] <+democrazyyy> i had so much trouble with the imps until i remembered the new counter system
[4:54:55] <@Menitta> that dude just saw it lmao
[4:54:56] <%HeroToxiko> i only found this during my last run, i just gunned it down the hallway when chariot went up
[4:54:56] <Frazbeee> @DedlokPM im talking about the platform he jumped on
[4:55:00] <dds333a> that phantom was RUNNING LUL
[4:55:03] <Pookiedaexzile> Gargoyles

[4:55:28] <tubit> they're more like gargoyles, true. i think they're called imps in game, tho
[4:55:28] <+Das_Prints> Man this dungeon is way more elaborate than I expected it to be
[4:55:33] <+cubbywolf> LUL

[4:56:02] <@Menitta> LIAR AHEAD
[4:56:04] <AlphaRayAllen> Liar ahead
[4:56:09] <+sevorai> It’s what he gets for sprinting in an unknown area tbh
[4:56:10] <theyseemerowling> Remember, that could mean 132 people rating it foul
[4:56:10] <+cubbywolf> they disparage the note and it still counts
[4:56:11] <xxHungryxx> Troll Ring
[4:56:14] <+ReallyBigRocks> negative appraisals still show up :)
[4:56:18] <%HeroToxiko> Rating happens even when bad rating
[4:56:21] <+mechslayer71> that's upvotes AND down votes woolie @woolieversus
[4:56:29] <+cubbywolf> I rate messages foul because it hurts the player who wrote it
[4:56:30] <SoaringTrumpet> every "hidden path ahead" I've encountered is a troll NotLikeThis
[4:56:32] <%whyskeywolfe> "I don't buy it!!" screamed Woolie, his belly full of Imp daggers.

[5:00:04] <+sevorai> I got my rematch at like level 56, felt good
[5:00:05] <+justianxix> just for tgr boss
[5:00:06] <cj_art> aw fuck
[5:00:09] <coziestbank> It only works past the point it stands
[5:00:10] <%oneimportantthing> He can't keep getting away with it
[5:00:10] <+sambws> It's mainly for bosses
[5:00:11] <%ArtemisCroc> it's not a checkpoint you hold onto
[5:00:11] <%Reveresao> boss only
[5:00:12] <perfect_disaster> I saw the first one but the one behind got me
[5:00:12] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus The stakes of Marika have very small range
[5:00:14] <%Prevot> it's just for the boss
[5:00:14] <SarcFa> stakes of marika only cover certain areas
[5:00:14] <+Jiggisnipe> sounds like it's for bosses
[5:00:15] <+sevorai> Marika is distance based
[5:00:20] <%oneimportantthing> That wasn't a boss Woolz
[5:00:21] <OldManDeckardCain> that statue is for the boss
[5:00:22] <+cubbywolf> the stakes have an area
[5:00:22] <+Jiggisnipe> to avoid the boss run
[5:00:23] <%insomniacCoder> you have too die near it
[5:00:25] <warlordpr> yes
[5:00:26] <+Vigonept> its the size of the boss room
[5:00:27] <%akajaybay> it's only ever proximity, you dont have to interact with it or anything
[5:00:35] <FrostedZaibatsu> Radial checkpoint
[5:00:37] <xxHungryxx> Run the gauntlet again Woolie
[5:00:37] <KaiserMario> very specific range
[5:00:37] <+cubbywolf> why would they change it?
[5:00:44] <%ArtemisCroc> no they work the same everywhere, otherwise if you died at the start, you would start at the boss
[5:00:44] <+Vigonept> TRY IT
[5:00:47] <coziestbank> You def can
[5:00:48] <+twohitgood> item is worth it
[5:00:48] <+kurosaru> *is the item worth it*
[5:00:48] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> you can
[5:00:49] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[5:00:49] <megaman_sentinel> nope
[5:00:49] <+dormoxx__> maybe?
[5:00:51] <AnthroMetal> you can

[5:00:59] <AnthroMetal> item yes, boss have fun
[5:01:00] <coziestbank> You absolutly can ran to it
[5:01:02] <resloxxx> worth it
[5:01:03] <+sevorai> It’s sooooo worth it
[5:01:05] <coziestbank> put you will die
[5:01:15] <%HeroToxiko> you weren't meant to survive the hit anyway so idk
[5:01:17] <linSP> Suicide run, they’re pretty hard to take on both at once
[5:01:36] <spaghettiweaver> @WoolieVersus not distance its zone/encounter based you could be near it but away from the intended encounter for it being there and you will be droped off at your last grace
[5:01:39] <warlordpr> this zones boss is nuts lol, can't wait
[5:01:39] <@Solidus_113> I don't think I actually got that item, so I don't know what it si
[5:01:42] <@Solidus_113> is*
[5:01:48] <+sambws> You have to stop swinging for a sec and get in closer
[5:01:52] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @Solidus_113 it's a very good thing
[5:01:57] <+darethsbane> FYI that red square debuff takes away 5% of your health
[5:01:57] <KaiserMario> You know what actually suck, when you can re-spawn at the Marika stake, you get the prompt, but the game just bugs out and you still re-spawn at the grace, happens on this one dungeon every time
[5:02:04] <+sevorai> It’s an EXTREMELY helpful item
[5:02:06] <QueequegTheater> @darethsbane Stop backseating
[5:02:09] <+twohitgood> any drop you survive is a good drop.

[5:03:42] <cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy> This is just fucking ridiculous. Are we that masochistic at this point as a community that we see blatantly artificial difficulty as a fun challenge? 😡😡😡
[5:03:44] <%Deasmeister> ds2 baby at least it doesnt keep poisoning you
[5:03:55] <+cubbywolf> what?
[5:04:00] <Frostilk> @KaiserMario I think I know which one you mean, the stake even spawns you further away, which sucks hard
[5:04:03] <+darkfoxxs> Yea
[5:04:04] <edward0286> Fun fact: if you roll around in poison or rot fields, it actually spreads faster
[5:04:05] <+AnActualHermitCrab> @cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy I saw your mom as a fun challenge last night HEYOOOOOOOO.
[5:04:06] <dds333a> @cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy based LUL
[5:04:08] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy bait?

[5:04:16] <+OniOniOniiii> yea stagger it
[5:04:28] <%okuriskyles> he did it!!
[5:04:35] <tolloponik> @Deasmeister yeah that was given to another status
[5:04:36] <dds333a> @cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy I actually found it funny, seriously LUL
[5:04:37] <@Menitta> there's nothing more heartbreaking when you miss a riposte on a boss
[5:04:56] <FrostedZaibatsu> Woolie this hesitation is killing me
[5:05:08] <dds333a> @frostedzaibatsu that's how he rolls LUL
[5:05:09] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> and now...goblins
[5:05:11] <edward0286> You can run all the way down after that drop
[5:05:16] <dds333a> i.e. not at all
[5:05:16] <NBUsagi> lol just an actual fuckin goblin
[5:05:18] <Frazbeee> its an imp not a goblin
[5:05:18] <+OniOniOniiii> worked out
[5:05:18] <+cubbywolf> mashing
[5:05:23] <+pectusumbra> counter hit
[5:05:32] <+robertoszek> tanky af
[5:05:35] <+cubbywolf> ppl thinking imps are goblins, pshhh
[5:05:46] <dds333a> Jump R2, based
[5:05:52] <+vaderxyz1970> more like gargoles
[5:05:55] <+Vigonept> Yes it is. i would know
[5:05:55] <KaiserMario> jumping R2 man
[5:06:03] <+hoenhime344> you hp aint all that rememeber
[5:06:08] <%Prevot> the mind imps are getting to woolie
[5:06:12] <+OniOniOniiii> works on up for spells too
[5:06:12] <+sevorai> Was a counter hit that did more than half
[5:06:13] <AnthroMetal> it's on all the d-pad i think
[5:06:14] <@Menitta> I never did this. I should come back here now that I've made decent progress
[5:06:16] <tolloponik> he's going for round 3?
[5:06:18] <AnthroMetal> def up and down
[5:06:20] <xxHungryxx> I like that bow
[5:06:21] <+cubbywolf> lol
[5:06:27] <dds333a> LUL
[5:06:29] <+vaderxyz1970> I put the flask on left d pad for quick acess
[5:06:34] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @Menitta it's worth it tbh
[5:06:35] <FrostedZaibatsu> I see why people can hate this game. First boss and first dungeon are fuckers
[5:06:38] <+pectusumbra> I wonder, is somethign above that flame spitter? could you ride it up?
[5:06:47] <AnthroMetal> @vaderxyz1970 holy shit thats a good idea
[5:06:56] <chaos2frozen> fuck me I'm an idiot, I could have shot those flame pillars as well!
[5:06:57] <+cubbywolf> time to die
[5:07:02] <%Jakeofalco> grab the item and go!
[5:07:12] <+cubbywolf> rip
[5:07:12] <+sevorai> This dungeon is definitely meant for later, any overworked boss counts as a boss too tbh
[5:07:15] <NBUsagi> Push him off?
[5:07:15] <theyseemerowling> @FrostedZaibatsu It's not that bad. Woolie cleared it pretty easily.
[5:07:16] <+OniOniOniiii> MAKE IT FALL
[5:07:18] <%RyTYoung> LUL
[5:07:24] <dds333a> OH GOD OH GOD OH GOD

[5:09:14] <+cubbywolf> no gloves only fap
[5:09:16] <+pectusumbra> but it doesn' break if you remove it I assume
[5:09:17] <%Stormzcales_Lair> so fap cost two keys
[5:09:18] <DedlokPM> @NBUsagi Ring of Favor and Protection. FAP Ring for short
[5:09:22] <+kurosaru> i wonder if there will be an 'erdtree's protection'
[5:09:30] <spaghettiweaver> what is that like 2-3 points in each stat from the talisman ?
[5:09:30] <%kewlmyc> Wait, they only have one talisman slot? How the fuck?
[5:09:30] <Shockmaster182> I really like the new menu

[5:09:34] <NBUsagi> @NBUsagi lol i have learned
[5:09:35] <%Th3SmartAlec> Thanks Woolie, I had thought I had cleared this dungeon and never got this LUL
[5:09:41] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> to be fair your armor is heavy, the hat too
[5:09:43] <%edgeroth> you gotta keep the gloves off for FAP
[5:09:52] <+cubbywolf> boss as a regular enemy
[5:09:57] <@Menitta> I wouldn't tbh
[5:10:01] <@Solidus_113> I wouldn't either
[5:10:03] <KaiserMario> That room still has more stuff
[5:10:04] <agustorm123> Wait it
[5:10:08] <BlackermanZX> yeah just go for the fog
[5:10:09] <+sevorai> Fuck the spider guys tbh

[5:10:14] <%edgeroth> !uptime
[5:10:14] <@Moobot> @edgeroth WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 5 hours and 36 minutes
[5:10:14] <%Prevot> I bet woolie can't beat either those guys or the boss right now
[5:10:14] <KaiserMario> whatever
[5:10:14] <linSP> they have a sick sword, but it’s a rare drop
[5:10:16] <+cubbywolf> if it can 2 shot you and it takes time to get to them k say save it for later
[5:10:18] <+vaderxyz1970> Nah the boss is eaiser fight in my opinion
[5:10:18] <+robertoszek> yeah, don't have to hit your head against that
[5:10:37] <dds333a> you're gonna hold that LUL
[5:10:38] <+vaderxyz1970> I mean the dungeon boss
[5:10:43] <QueequegTheater> THEN PERISH]
[5:10:44] <warlordpr> the fog gate boss is harder but you can take a peek
[5:10:46] <Dopamien> how do you even die if you beat it afterward?
[5:10:51] <+sewermonk> this boss is gonna be so fun
[5:11:02] <%セビー> the tutorial boss doesnt even give runes
[5:11:07] <buerdo> don't need torch either
[5:11:11] <tolloponik> now for the rest of the stream Kappa
[5:11:14] <%セビー> @dopamien the game finds a way
[5:11:18] <%edgeroth> oh right he still has to go through the actual fog gate lol
[5:11:22] <%HeroToxiko> just throw that armor away LUL
[5:11:26] <Frostilk> why fight 1v2, when you can use the traps against them woolieEVIL
[5:11:45] <%kewlmyc> lol, I didn't realize Talisman pouches were a thing. Just looked it up. Never realized I only had one before a certain boss fight

[5:25:08] <elshadow7> Yep, if you stick real close, you only need to worry about the arms really
[5:25:22] <NBUsagi> We in the Woolie zone
[5:25:23] <%akajaybay> yeah godrick soldiers are real ones but friendship over, demi-humans are my new best friend
[5:25:30] <dds333a> @frostilk yeah, we opening the betting pool Kappa
[5:25:34] <spaghettiweaver> F
[5:25:35] <%edgeroth> this boss has more forgiving hotboxes than I initially thought
[5:25:35] <tubit> oooh
[5:25:36] <dds333a> *?
[5:26:02] <Frazbeee> that is such a monster hunter move
[5:26:04] <+Jiggisnipe> it's hitboxes aren't crazy so that's good
[5:26:08] <+Jiggisnipe> its*
[5:26:09] <+scarman125> he definitely needs to turn those blue flasks red for this fight
[5:26:10] <+0neReeler> bigshockwave
[5:26:11] <%SirGO0SE> dont forget your wondrous physic, i think i see it there
[5:26:14] <NiuenSaien> big monster hunter vibes
[5:26:15] <@Solidus_113> remember you can sprint backwards too while locked on
[5:26:20] <+vaderxyz1970> You got it
[5:26:23] <+dormoxx__> @SirGO0SE used it at the top of the fight
[5:26:25] <elshadow7> Definitely doable
[5:26:26] <+flipsilog> level up
[5:26:28] <Frazbeee> he winds up that bite like odogaron
[5:26:35] <%akajaybay> has the damage on spells been checked?
[5:26:42] <BlackermanZX> you could upgrade a lil bit
[5:26:43] <+pectusumbra> I mean use them in place of swords
[5:26:45] <%SirGO0SE> @SirGO0SE 👍
[5:26:46] <+Jiggisnipe> you can check
[5:26:51] <%akajaybay> might suck, but damage type swings are heavy in this
[5:26:53] <dero45> with bleed this seems easy work
[5:26:54] <+OniOniOniiii> yea i cast in the ass because my magic is real good
[5:26:57] <+sevorai> Bleed on this mf is so gross
[5:27:00] <+pectusumbra> after he lunges or while doing a breath. Or if you back up while he does a body explosion
[5:27:01] <+OrangeMDT> Yo, is Woolie going for that O?
[5:27:10] <+Jiggisnipe> he's crazy so it might miss but he's also big so maybe it'll hit
[5:27:21] <+vaderxyz1970> You can use grease to help
[5:27:32] <%hax_metatron> Poise breaking is High tier Elden RIng play -- It's so viable, and overpowered if you properly mix hravy / jumping attacks or guard counters
[5:27:32] <+0neReeler> tree huh? probably fire
[5:27:34] <dds333a> MASSIVE
[5:27:53] <Frazbeee> try the soldiers
[5:27:54] <tolloponik> it was 1.5 of your swings
[5:27:57] <%jvilly96> Jellyfish trust
[5:28:00] <%akajaybay> maybe fire but it also breathes fire
[5:28:13] <%oneimportantthing> Use a fire pape- err I mean grease
[5:28:14] <+OniOniOniiii> i use ancestral spirit
[5:28:19] <coziestbank> Maybe wolves after enrage?
[5:28:19] <+Vigonept> nah fires red not yellow
[5:28:24] <%akajaybay> ah yeah
[5:28:29] <%Bread_Assassin> Carian Slicer served me well when I did more early run of this.
[5:28:36] <+0neReeler> decent dmage
[5:28:44] <moonbearbacon> that did alright
[5:28:49] <%Prevot> magic damage wasn't bad actually
[5:28:50] <+pectusumbra> you can cast, but you have to do it in place of a swing basically
[5:28:50] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[5:28:51] <+vaderxyz1970> Wolves take a good chunk of fp
[5:29:01] <%insomniacCoder> oleg if you have 100fp
[5:29:11] <nintega010> does he have jellyfish
[5:29:14] <+vaderxyz1970> He doesn't have olegv
[5:29:23] <coziestbank> @insomniacCoder oleg is the reward lol
[5:29:30] <%thesw1tch> why not just cast to see how much it does before the wolves
[5:29:37] <%insomniacCoder> ok
[5:30:00] <+Jiggisnipe> big slap
[5:30:04] <+OniOniOniiii> what a dodge
[5:30:05] <elshadow7> Learn the delays = crush the fight
[5:30:07] <+vaderxyz1970> better with sword
[5:30:16] <dds333a> I would love to see the modeling process for this thing
[5:30:27] <%insomniacCoder> then fire grease for more damage
[5:30:28] <dds333a> All the beta animations put together
[5:30:47] <+sevorai> Dps wise the sword seems better
[5:30:47] <%SirGO0SE> @dds333a the bone structure must be wild
[5:31:07] <resloxxx> the sword is simply better since it can trigger the stagger
[5:31:14] <+robertoszek> @dds333a the boss room would look like the inside of a blender
[5:31:25] <Blank9> clipping the head with the jump attack probably does a lot too
[5:31:26] <+Jiggisnipe> cookin
[5:31:26] <%akajaybay> sword does seems simpler if the magic doesnt have a real big bump

[5:31:58] <+kurosaru> would trying a torch be worth it?
[5:32:00] <dds333a> Then THAT'S the runback
[5:32:03] <elshadow7> I'd say 2hand always
[5:32:13] <elshadow7> Forget the shield entirely
[5:32:16] <moonbearbacon> yeah is a torch a secret weapon?
[5:32:20] <QueequegTheater> I went in with 25 vitality and a _6 greatsword, just charged R2'ed him to death

[6:17:25] <dds333a> @jiggisnipe based LUL
[6:17:30] <+JT_Jag> Pebble and Arc are the building blocks of this game's magic system
[6:17:32] <ThatChainmecha> maybe my build is wonky
[6:17:38] <@Solidus_113> yes
[6:17:38] <%Indigo_Automaton> Arc is really useful

[6:17:50] <%radiorosewater> It's very good
[6:17:52] <+JT_Jag> Pebble is super efficient
[6:17:54] <+ReallyBigRocks> @ThatChainmecha the boss here is just a normal enemy as far as I know
[6:17:54] <+JT_Jag> FP-wise
[6:17:56] <ThatChainmecha> crystal barrage is not good
[6:17:56] <%radiorosewater> YEYEYE
[6:17:58] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> I think it can go through enemies as well
[6:17:59] <BlackermanZX> isnt barrage ass
[6:18:01] <@Solidus_113> just sword does magic damage
[6:18:02] <iacus_> i wasnt able to use barrage effectively
[6:18:07] <iacus_> seems pt situational
[6:18:11] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @jerp barrage fucks up land octopuses

[6:18:35] <Jerp> @Reverend_Roscoe is there any enemy that isn't easy to kill or better served by another spell?
[6:18:36] <+justianxix> insult me more pls
[6:18:37] <Dio_TR> Reminder that Woolie went through Doom, Doom Eternal, Bungie’s Halo games and Black mesa and COD INFINITE WARFARE in the past two years. Woolie is also a FPS channel

[6:18:58] <+SaintSalted> dont think so she vibed with my dumbass
[6:18:58] <VidulaSaix> Oh you can definitely get stuck. I had to reset twice LUL
[6:19:02] <+ReallyBigRocks> careful, jumping can damage NPCs
[6:19:02] <+vaderxyz1970> Nah she's just tough love
[6:19:06] <elshadow7> @Jerp You're able to sometimes stunlock certain low-poise enemies, but it's always faster to just kill them with more damaging spells so..
[6:19:07] <+yeknomlive> magic in this game is so interesting but I'm dying to go str on my next toon
[6:19:09] <%jinking79> there the woolie jump foreshadowing
[6:19:13] <+bravo059> Wait, I didn't know you could keep her alive. I attacked her when I found her locked up because she wouldn't let me free her
[6:19:24] <ThatChainmecha> DEX/INT probably sucks in pvp but its killing off so many bosses that everyone is getting stuck on in my playthrough
[6:19:27] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @jerp i dunno, but barrage to the face chews through octopuses tentacles and breaks them pretty quick
[6:19:27] <mrtanaka111> so woolie gave up on 30 faith just like that
[6:19:31] <thewrathofscience> 1 thing that never gets old for me is furniture just shattering on impact lol
[6:19:46] <%kewlmyc> Yeah, I got stuck on the environment once in a dungeon, and had to abandon all of my souls to get out.
[6:19:47] <ThatChainmecha> *jumps near table*
[6:19:48] <%CisealNine> That is the below average dialogue.
[6:19:53] <Jerp> @Reverend_Roscoe yeah, but you can just hit them with pebble for less FP and it still posture breaks them while doing more damage
[6:19:59] <+JT_Jag> @ThatChainmecha yeah sorcery + dex is a legitimate glass cannon build
[6:20:07] <ThatChainmecha> accurate
[6:20:08] <%Ashenik1> Sadge
[6:20:13] <+0neReeler> no maiden to hold my hand...
[6:20:18] <dds333a> Cernunnos
[6:20:19] <+yeknomlive> I'm doing dex faith and it's also pretty glass cannony
[6:20:20] <ThatChainmecha> i die super quick to bosses...
[6:20:24] <spaghettiweaver> wish maiden lady showed up more
[6:20:26] <ThatChainmecha> but thats only if i get hit
[6:20:30] <velgaduere> one day
[6:20:32] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> big sword swish swoosh get

[6:20:44] <spaghettiweaver> :(
[6:20:48] <user_naim> Melina can I hold hands again
[6:20:48] <VidulaSaix> Slicer is stupid strong
[6:20:59] <velgaduere> "you gotta be THIS smart to blow some bubbles"
[6:21:00] <+SaintSalted> bubblebeam
[6:21:00] <ThatChainmecha> they should get the gravity rock spell
[6:21:01] <dds333a> LUL
[6:21:03] <+tkzhyon> you ain't cheezaa
[6:21:03] <+lightbringrrrr> bubbles are terrible
[6:21:06] <ThatChainmecha> i dont know where i got it
[6:21:06] <mrtanaka111> you COULD be
[6:21:07] <+JT_Jag> You should buy Glintstone Pebble while you're here
[6:21:07] <ThatLuluTho> Isn't Arcane bugged rn too or was it patched
[6:21:08] <+pectusumbra> Look, with how long this game is, you'll get to like level 120 or some shit
[6:21:08] <+SaintSalted> we krabby
[6:21:09] <Heefnoff> Ah Woolie his name is CHEZAH
[6:21:09] <dds333a> No SHAMON CUTTA
[6:21:10] <ThatChainmecha> but its really good
[6:21:12] <Jerp> bubbles were pretty weak in the network test. I was intending to figure out if they were any good until I saw they required arcane
[6:21:13] <+lightbringrrrr> You're not Alexander!
[6:21:14] <+aaymon86> Cesaaaaaaaa
[6:21:16] <+Vigonept> is hamon faith or int
[6:21:16] <+sambws> The arc is really good
[6:21:19] <yukichocomilk> better mark this one on the map lol
[6:21:26] <+HelloImTom08> use map markers, makes it easy to remember
[6:21:26] <velgaduere> might be worth putting a marker on the map to tell you she's here
[6:21:28] <%Deasmeister> Slicer straight replaced my sword for boss fights
[6:21:37] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> the extra slot is REALLY good yeah
[6:21:48] <+mechslayer71> maybe you should have the staff as the alternate to the shield, so you can flow with both hands?
[6:21:53] <ThatChainmecha> who needs carian slicer when you got bleed damage lol
[6:21:53] <+JT_Jag> Slicer is one of the only spells in the early game that has a better damage to FP cost ratio than pebble
[6:21:58] <+0neReeler> maybe?
[6:22:00] <VidulaSaix> Yeah Slicer is insane
[6:22:02] <velgaduere> could be a different one?
[6:22:04] <+pectusumbra> @Vigonept arcane for sure. Sword of luck and pluck plus Johnathan winning vs. Kars out of sheer luck
[6:22:07] <@Solidus_113> mash it

[6:23:30] <ThatChainmecha> yooo
[6:23:36] <+JT_Jag> in terms of pure efficiency at this point in the game you really can't do better than pebble, arc and slicer
[6:23:37] <Blank9> it does a lot of damage
[6:23:38] <+aaymon86> This is pretty cool
[6:23:56] <spaghettiweaver> woolie once again cutting down the working class

[6:27:41] <Aussie_Manny> It looks so useful. A slash with a defensive retreat.
[6:27:48] <+Dakuu75> I think it's about 18-20 Mind for 100 FP, that feels like a good amount
[6:27:50] <morkelebmink> this just proves tht the ginyu force is right, got to style all over your enemies
[6:27:50] <+ReallyBigRocks> can you use two staves and power stance magic swords?

[6:39:34] <velgaduere> lobosKek
[6:39:37] <$genocidal_cupcake> @NBUsagi Yup
[6:39:41] <Aussie_Manny> What's this? Paladin?
[6:39:45] <FrostedZaibatsu> Wait how did you get down there?
[6:39:46] <user_naim> @dds333a i think you have see more of it for it to show up in screen
[6:39:48] <+mechslayer71> but does it pierce?
[6:39:50] <%kewlmyc> @NBUsagi He'll cream himself when he eventually finds the Moonveil sword
[6:39:53] <skagtheprinceofhell> Gets bigger as it goes out to
[6:39:56] <skagtheprinceofhell> Pretty good
[6:39:56] <+yeknomlive> @frostedzaibatsu jump
[6:39:56] <+askalta> Yo Woolies rocking the bloodhound fang? this thing is my go to everytime
[6:39:58] <+JT_Jag> It 100% pieces
[6:40:00] <+pectusumbra> Pop some pocket runes to grab summon swords?
[6:40:01] <+JT_Jag> *pierces
[6:40:03] <xxHungryxx> A true zoner spell
[6:40:05] <NBUsagi> Woolie just need to find the right Katan
[6:40:19] <FrostedZaibatsu> @yeknomlive holy fuck im dumb. i never thought of that
[6:40:20] <user_naim> @dds333a oh well now i’m interested
[6:40:24] <skagtheprinceofhell> So, less damage but further
[6:40:35] <iacus_> good for crowds too
[6:40:35] <+pectusumbra> to be fair you aren't sniping with arc. You're shotgunning
[6:40:37] <%akajaybay> magic shotgun
[6:40:37] <+Dakuu75> farther than you think but, less than you expect
[6:40:45] <%Prevot> arc is for multiple enemies
[6:40:50] <NBUsagi> you can charge the spells cant you?
[6:40:54] <moonbearbacon> I know a caravan that might have the answer
[6:40:57] <Blank9> arc penetrates
[6:41:05] <@Solidus_113> yeah caravan can test that
[6:41:07] <user_naim> @dds333a then the secret is fae
[6:41:08] <+solzan2000> yea arc is crowd control
[6:41:11] <user_naim> safe*
[6:41:20] <+blue_grave> I used the arc to finish off godrick
[6:41:22] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> GAMING
[6:41:23] <+yeknomlive> @frostedzaibatsu I definitely did not jump down for awhile lol
[6:41:25] <NBUsagi> Ooft, the shadow step is sexy
[6:41:26] <%hax_metatron> As a mage, I would put FP flask on a hotbar shortcut.
[6:41:29] <BlackermanZX> ya really need some more FP bar
[6:41:30] <Treasure_Vault> Glintsword into arc?
[6:41:44] <Raldavar> Cast it back to back. Easy crowd clear
[6:41:50] <@Solidus_113> @hax_metatron actually smart
[6:41:57] <+askalta> the charge r2 followup is a second attack
[6:42:04] <coziestbank> 2nd R2 charge is a triple
[6:42:04] <%hax_metatron> @solidus_113 I have 70 INT LUL
[6:42:05] <stormhawk9891> Charged heavies are a bit different
[6:42:11] <Boreos_GLHF> The hammer of Jesus
[6:42:11] <DSD24> Crusader
[6:42:12] <+Dakuu75> that was a sentence
[6:42:12] <@Solidus_113> I'm at 57
[6:42:13] <user_naim> I keep accidentaly using the hotbar items when i try to two hand
[6:42:21] <+pectusumbra> gotta commit

[6:51:54] <+immortalvanguard21> hey boys  how it goin?
[6:51:56] <+Jiggisnipe> mess with it after stream
[6:51:58] <%hax_metatron> INT INT INT INT INT
[6:51:59] <+thefancywig> your brain will have to adjust still

[6:52:05] <+Jaromero435> tech unlocked
[6:52:05] <%hax_metatron> BIG BRAIN SORCERER
[6:52:07] <%crybirb> What hotbar?
[6:52:08] <+thefancywig> but it's less shuffling
[6:52:09] <%Th3SmartAlec> Lab reopen? LUL
[6:52:09] <Treasure_Vault> Restart the game
[6:52:09] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> lab?
[6:52:09] <@Solidus_113> not faster but you don't need to scroll items @WoolieVersus
[6:52:11] <%Deasmeister> much better
[6:52:12] <iacus_> it's hold + press vs press or change + press
[6:52:12] <BlackermanZX> open the lab
[6:52:15] <%RyTYoung> That might be pretty big brain right there
[6:52:21] <+immortalvanguard21> lytSUPERWOAH
[6:52:22] <+0neReeler> i already do it for horse
[6:52:34] <%crybirb> What hotbar? I'm 80 hours in almost at the end boss and there's a hotbar?
[6:52:41] <FrostedZaibatsu> Left and right for the flask
[6:52:42] <%JetpackMcQuack> Should work
[6:52:42] <%Prevot> maybe just the magic one?
[6:52:43] <+cubbywolf> if you are bad at switching for blue to red then seems good
[6:52:44] <+allups> i changed my interact button to square
[6:52:44] <Boreos_GLHF> I guess it always depends how much you overstack your potion belt
[6:52:46] <%Jakeofalco> @WoolieVersus remember you can hold down to do straight to a heal
[6:52:47] <%hax_metatron> Put health on one
[6:52:47] <%JetpackMcQuack> left right down
[6:52:48] <+robertoszek> It's cool for fp builds, I guess
[6:52:54] <+cubbywolf> thats a good idea
[6:52:55] <%funya_rinpa> it doesn't sound that useful when you can just hold down to switch to health instantly and just once to switch to fp
[6:52:58] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> and Physic is a one time thing anyway so yeah
[6:52:58] <%Th3SmartAlec> I'm doing it right now LUL
[6:53:02] <+0neReeler> left red, right blue
[6:53:03] <+cubbywolf> you could put your summons on the hot bar
[6:53:06] <%hax_metatron> That’s the way to play caster
[6:53:15] <+cubbywolf> holding triangle takes a sec
[6:53:21] <@Solidus_113> no you don't
[6:53:21] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[6:53:24] <+cubbywolf> C L A W
[6:53:29] <DSD24> I put Torrent and Summons on hotbar
[6:53:30] <CrimsonGargoyle> claw inputs LUL
[6:53:31] <+thatbossnoodle> you can also hot bar Torrent and unbind dismount L3 to keep from accidental presses
[6:53:31] <+Vigonept> naaah claw it
[6:53:32] <@Solidus_113> claw it up
[6:53:33] <%hax_metatron> No
[6:53:34] <+cubbywolf> LUL
[6:53:34] <+mechslayer71> it's a quick tap tho
[6:53:35] <+thefancywig> yeah you gotta claw it
[6:53:36] <%Deasmeister> claw
[6:53:38] <Dopamien> double claw
[6:53:39] <+cubbywolf> GET GUD
[6:53:40] <+thefancywig> it's not ideal
[6:53:40] <dds333a> move it over LUL
[6:53:42] <%Prevot> you also have to stop moving to cycle the items tho
[6:53:44] <%JetpackMcQuack> life finds a way
[6:53:47] <dds333a> Tekken it
[6:53:50] <%hax_metatron> Clawtech
[6:53:52] <CrimsonGargoyle> it's definitely some finger yoga involved
[6:53:55] <+0neReeler> same amount of time rolling and mashing down to switch
[6:53:55] <+thefancywig> there's pros and cons
[6:53:55] <+Vigonept> call the reggie assist for a flask
[6:53:56] <+OrangeMDT> You can flick it
[6:53:59] <+robertoszek> @Prevot good point, huh
[6:54:01] <+self_harmonize> Do you have a controller with paddles?
[6:54:04] <+cubbywolf> my horse is on the triangle summon
[6:54:04] <%hax_metatron> But it’s a small moment of thinking aneyway
[6:54:06] <dds333a> @vigonept LUL
[6:54:11] <%hax_metatron> It’s the same time as switching mentally
[6:54:14] <+cubbywolf> hes on ps5 controller i think so no paddles
[6:54:29] <%Anidem1714> I’ve been rolling my thumb knuckle onto the left on the dpad so I don’t have to stop to summon torrent
[6:54:33] <iacus_> at least cerulean maybe
[6:54:37] <+allups> u can have all 3 flask on the hot bar
[6:54:38] <+self_harmonize> Because if you bind a paddle to Y you can move while doing it
[6:54:39] <iacus_> not a bad idea
[6:54:42] <+cubbywolf> always switch back to red flask
[6:54:52] <+cubbywolf> the lab LUL
[6:54:55] <iacus_> i'm gonna try that myself
[6:55:02] <+cubbywolf> even after a full day streaming he's going back in
[6:55:08] <dds333a> LUL LUL
[6:55:13] <Aussie_Manny> ooohhhhh elden chat
[6:55:16] <@Solidus_113> My hotbar is full with Horse, Lantern, Tear Ashes, and Binos
[6:55:25] <dds333a> I don't think I was there for that, so I gotta peep the vid LUL
[6:55:46] <+cubbywolf> woolies tribulations will never end
[6:55:52] <+cubbywolf> not as long as I have amazon prime to send him
[6:55:56] <Treasure_Vault> Get your Veldt in, Woolie. Great stream, as always.
