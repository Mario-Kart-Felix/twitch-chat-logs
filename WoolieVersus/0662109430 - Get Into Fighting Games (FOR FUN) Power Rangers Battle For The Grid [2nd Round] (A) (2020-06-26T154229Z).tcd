[0:07:56] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Dino Thunder is the GOAT though.
[0:08:02] <Kei_Ar_> ZEO is an easy choice
[0:08:05] <raikagelord1> Jungle fury honorable mention
[0:08:05] <mid_sneak> The solo in the intro is god like
[0:08:06] <%ggbhtg> RANGERS AT THE CORRRRRE
[0:08:09] <%YakumoYomi> What about the openings for the Super Sentai counterparts? The Japanese OPs are FIRE
[0:08:11] <ZeeJiggle> Little V makes Zeo number 1 for me.

[0:24:55] <%DatAsuna> Piloted by jack
[0:25:05] <morningmoondude> DinoCharge's first Megazord had big drill
[0:25:09] <+Cobalt_Racer> why not both?
[0:25:11] <%LowSkillGod> woolieCHAN woolieCHAN woolieCHAN
[0:25:25] <%CaptainPileDriver> so season 28 of power rangers which comes out in 2021 has a weird edgy knights thing
[0:25:26] <+How2BEpic> Remind Woolie to debug this.
[0:25:26] <%dekkitout> Dinocharge or Dino Thunder- or did they both have drills?
[0:25:28] <BackwardCap> A Giant Punchgirl Mech called "The Dread Naught"
[0:25:30] <%CaptainPileDriver> and it looks fucking cool
[0:25:39] <Japanfreak2595> Shinkenger tho
[0:25:45] <Ghostbody> huh
[0:25:46] <Nicholasgerald1> you should listen to dino thunder it has a banger opening also reggie should watch lupinranger v. patoranger
[0:25:47] <notmediahead> super sentai or kamen rider?
[0:25:48] <arurorablade> time force has a drill
[0:26:06] <%CaptainPileDriver> i know
[0:26:07] <@Solidus_113> It's got crossplay tho
[0:26:08] <arurorablade> depends on the series head
[0:26:09] <ULT_13> power rangers as of late has been sorta lacking in content, sentai has more fun
[0:26:12] <%CaptainPileDriver> i don't have room on my laptop
[0:26:14] <artificiallynatural> FULL CROSSPLAY
[0:26:15] <%gatorafan> Would you be mad if The End of the World made a Megazord with other mechs but got arms in the process? daedra1DerpyTibs
[0:26:17] <@Solidus_113> Not first
[0:26:20] <NathanTZ> Chouju Sentai Liveman is good shit if y’all haven’t seen it yet.
[0:26:20] <Bloogoose> It's nuts
[0:26:20] <@Solidus_113> Minecraft was
[0:26:28] <BalloniWright> STADIA
[0:26:28] <SuperCreeperBlocks> Steam?
[0:26:31] <%ggbhtg> THE GRID IS CONNECTED
[0:26:32] <warmnoid> LUL
[0:26:34] <+roseshrimp> time force spanihs opening its fucking kino. tiempo
[0:26:36] <ULT_13> but I like kakuranger
[0:26:38] <%anthonywilde1994> woooo
[0:26:41] <@Solidus_113> Minecraft and Rocket League did it before
[0:26:41] <BackwardCap> The Stadia version is actually not terrible.
[0:26:44] <%ggbhtg> @WoolieVersus My stream froze as SOON as you said STADIA. CURSED
[0:26:47] <warmnoid> everyone is here
[0:26:49] <%infinite_rotation> Everyone is here
[0:26:57] <NathanTZ> So I could attempt to play against you if I jump on my Ps4?
[0:27:03] <@Solidus_113> yes
[0:27:08] <+TechnoSyndrome> crossplay could make so many niche games thrive for longer with a combined playerpool
[0:27:08] <+TheOneCalledRock> @Solidus_113 with all the consoles? because i remember sony having issues with it at first
[0:27:09] <Azathotic> @ggbhtg Say Stadia three times backwards into a mirror
[0:27:09] <+badjab326> Every game at EA play today had crossplay
[0:27:10] <NathanTZ> Tight!
[0:27:13] <BackwardCap> Unlike SamSho on Stadia, you can play it online.
[0:27:15] <%gatorafan> All it's missing it's the Vita Port Kappa
[0:27:15] <@Solidus_113> There's probably an online option to enable it
[0:27:26] <+calebstanford9> Yo y'all know about Kamen Rider Fourze? It was written by Kazuki Nakashima of TTGL and Trigger fame @WoolieVersus
[0:27:26] <+badjab326> Apex getting crossplay this fall
[0:27:27] <%Jetzord> you can enable in in lobbies
[0:27:28] <%ggbhtg> @WoolieVersus Sent you one more donation to read before yall start
[0:27:31] <Artoo_The_Me> The ONE console is comin
[0:27:34] <%Irridium> Think Fortnite did the cross-play thing with everything first
[0:27:41] <arurorablade> not full cross play
[0:27:45] <+saltpiggu> test
