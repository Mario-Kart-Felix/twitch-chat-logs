[0:06:13] <plushysceptile> So this is apparently an updated version of a game called The Kung Fu Master Jackie Chan. There's even lore explaining why some characters are those weird colors; they died between games and were raised as undead

[0:07:36] <Solidnick18> fist of fire is awesome
[0:07:40] <%SivSarcast> It was also Minh's debut on the couch if I recall, a historical moment for sure.
[0:07:42] <VidulaSaix> Its a good meme LUL
[0:07:44] <Applecannon63> bummer

[0:07:47] <2017y> making 800 new class crystals was a shit tier move tho
[0:07:47] <%ggbhtg> I've never seen't this
[0:07:48] <Darren716> Is his super sending his son to prison for weed?
[0:07:55] <DSD24> This game was hype as fuck
[0:08:02] <+krispen_wa> Yu Mo Gui Gwai Fai Di Zao
[0:08:04] <Darren716> Or is it saying Hong Kong doesn't deserve rights
[0:08:06] <ElectricEmissary> maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
[0:08:07] <ElectricEmissary> n
[0:08:09] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Maaaaaaaan
[0:08:14] <VidulaSaix> Jackie Chan Adventures has no right being sa fucking great as it was
[0:08:15] <%emperordread> xaolin was pretty ok tbh
[0:08:15] <+krispen_wa> THERE WAS A REBOOT?
[0:08:16] <Applecannon63> uhhh
[0:08:18] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Xiaolin Showdown was the SHIT
[0:08:21] <+Velociraptor_Cleftes> ONE MOOOOOORE THING
[0:08:21] <Darren716> Xaolin was sick
[0:08:24] <DSD24> Raymundo was a shot
[0:08:25] <ElectricEmissary> xiaolin showdown was the shit is right
[0:08:28] <andre11dr> Wait, there was a game for it?
[0:08:28] <Solidnick18> i had that game
[0:08:33] <+ThisIsLloyd> yeah kinda jackie chan adventures was first
[0:08:36] <NeroInfinite> JAcki chan adventures came first.
[0:08:41] <%ggbhtg> They were both solid tho
[0:08:48] <DedlokPM> Jackie was 1st, the Xiaolin
[0:08:48] <ElectricEmissary> gong yi te pai or however it's spelled
[0:08:49] <DSD24> It was great
[0:08:49] <servicesuspension> I didn't like when they made the duels 3D for some reason
[0:08:49] <%ggbhtg> who cares if they had a similar premise
[0:08:50] <Applecannon63> Xiaolin Showdown got rough when they include that mini Omi
[0:08:50] <NeroInfinite> Xiaolin showdown was..different-ish?
[0:08:54] <+krispen_wa> they were like 2 years apart in terms of release
[0:08:54] <+FrostedZaibatsu> Nothing can top Jackie Chan Adventures
[0:08:59] <DaKnightWarrior> It's a great show.
[0:09:00] <%ggbhtg> a bit past your time, but they were both solid
[0:09:11] <DaKnightWarrior> Good old Fox Kids.
[0:09:11] <+SignScratch> You Mo Gui Gwai Fai Do Zao
[0:09:12] <VidulaSaix> Jackie, Jade, Uncle, Tohru
[0:09:13] <Super_Voltekka> AIYAAAAAAAAAA
[0:09:18] <+krispen_wa> i just remember the girl in xiaolin showdown inexplicably had a different design every episode
[0:09:19] <Applecannon63> Why did they decide to ad a Mini Omi!?
[0:09:21] <A_Classy_Gentleman> I see it. Both were culturally-themed "collect the superpower object" shows. Both were pretty rad.
[0:09:25] <andre11dr> I remember Shaolin Showdown being pretty good
[0:09:37] <servicesuspension> Jackie Chan Adventures was, for me the last great action/adventure cartoon
[0:09:37] <Applecannon63> Rip Wuya
[0:09:40] <%ggbhtg> That Xiaolin Chronicles reboot tho....leaned too much into 3D, and Omi did not need a mini me at all
[0:09:47] <MrPedrovsky> @woolieversus When Next GIFG Newcomers with Woolie Jr. ?? :)
[0:09:48] <ElectricEmissary> ye was good
[0:09:54] <+SignScratch> Jackiiiiiiie!
[0:10:05] <andre11dr> The most memorable thing was the foot fetish which
[0:10:07] <+IsThisOne> this game is fucking sick
[0:10:13] <Bail_Seven> if avatar didnt exist Jackie chan adventure would be the cartoon i rave about
[0:10:22] <Applecannon63> Jack Spicer is the best

[1:06:16] <Bazal68k> I keep hearing the Gnome "hoo!"
[1:06:17] <Applecannon63> EVIL RYU LAU
[1:06:17] <@Menitta> I thought it was Start + button
[1:06:19] <%ggbhtg> "Start + an attack button on the same frame when selecting a character, you will unlock a "boss" version of that character. Boss characters get one extra air juggle during combos and have a different color palette. Many boss characters can easily stun and kill an opponent off a single touch, so they are generally banned or limited to only low/mid tier characters (Kim-Maree, Yeung, Sam, and Spiritual Kung-Fu Jackie)."
[1:06:27] <NeroInfinite> WHY IS GOIGN SUPER SAYIAN?
[1:06:27] <eriksdrums> Picking up a Ming vase will unlock "I don't want any trouble Jackie", who is essentially Saitama
[1:06:31] <ultrayoshi115> a tourney I was in didn't ban them and I got knocked out by boss lion

[1:13:29] <+Dropkick_Rabbit> I seriously love how you can't defeat Jackie. He just gets back up and congratuates you
[1:13:30] <+TopTieramisu> yeah jackie still is around
[1:13:30] <357Sneak> yeah he is!
[1:13:31] <+GalacticaPhanto> @astrodropgaming and his daughter is a lesbian so he's not happy about that
[1:13:37] <eriksdrums> The less touble he wants, the more powerful he becomes
[1:13:46] <Lanxide> Jackie Chan still do movies or he retired by now?
[1:13:47] <dds333a> @astrodropgaming cmonBruh, huh, I'll do look into that some more, thanks

[1:14:00] <AstrodropGaming> @GalacticaPhanto Oh I didn't even know about that LUL LUL
[1:14:01] <NeroInfinite> He's retired by now I think
[1:14:07] <Pookiedaexzile> He just did a movie where he fought the ultimate enemy
[1:14:09] <dds333a> That was supposed to be an emote, btw
[1:14:10] <Pookiedaexzile> The Irish
[1:14:12] <andre11dr> Sometimes a little to much, like he got hurt for real on some stunts
[1:14:23] <@Menitta> wasnt he in some sci fi movie recently
[1:14:34] <Lanxide> Jackie still do his own stunts even at his age
[1:14:36] <%CaptainPileDriver> man sf6 better not have the stupid sit on the main menu for 1-3 minutes as you wait for it to connect like sfv does
[1:14:36] <dds333a> Jackie also did a survival movie or something recently, too
[1:14:40] <+XdaXcaptainX> i thought jackies son was just a pothead and china escalates that to "demonic child murderer:
[1:15:10] <Pookiedaexzile> No not the green satan
[1:15:44] <Lanxide> didn't Jackie Chan have his own Kpop group at one time?
[1:15:52] <+TopTieramisu> seizure warning

[1:40:46] <alexion97> Why cant I cheer?
[1:40:47] <Alexalchemy> But yeah, this game has a lot of depth into it, especially combos and infinites
[1:40:53] <Ardisan_> Rising Tackle Tatsus
[1:40:56] <+TopTieramisu> he's got the yuri overhead
[1:41:04] <alexion97> I just gave twitch money so I can give woolie my bits
[1:41:14] <dds333a> Imagine a Vertical Rising Tackle monkaS
[1:41:24] <eriksdrums> Damn! He ain't gon be in Rush Hour 3
[1:41:27] <dds333a> Horizontal, shit
[1:41:27] <%ggbhtg> @Alexalchemy is it hosted on your channel?
[1:41:27] <andre11dr> What is dumber ,rising tackle or spinning bird kick?
[1:41:38] <+TopTieramisu> rising tackle is cool af
[1:41:41] <dds333a> @andre11dr the firmer
[1:41:52] <JunPrk> the christ air
[1:41:55] <eriksdrums> JUST LIKE REAL JACKIE!
[1:41:56] <Ardisan_> the most firm one
[1:42:08] <DedlokPM> @alexion97 how many are you trying to do? Because I see it says that the cheer minimum on the channel is 500 bits
[1:42:10] <+TopTieramisu> i honestly think tatsu looks really silly
[1:42:16] <Alexalchemy> @ggbhtg Nah, in ANOTHER CHANNEL
[1:42:17] <+TopTieramisu> sean/dan's version looks way better
[1:42:22] <%kyun_dere> alright i gotta go, it was nice playin ya woolie and reg
[1:42:22] <fat_burtreynolds> You played ya self
[1:42:36] <Applecannon63> Spinning Bird Kick is cool especially since I learned that it was based on Hokuto no Ken
[1:42:41] <%ggbhtg> tell me the channel yo @Alexalchemy
[1:42:44] <alexion97> @alexion97 yeah, I'm trying 500 exactly
[1:42:51] <Applecannon63> and no I don't mean the Lighting Kick
[1:42:54] <jellymang> "THIS IS /MY/ GAME"
[1:42:57] <andre11dr> I always found spinning bird kick to look really dumb ,at least with rising tackle you get the Rock super which almost makes it cool
[1:43:24] <Alexalchemy> @ggbhtg Can i post it here or dms?
[1:43:27] <ChansonNoire> big counterhit
[1:43:29] <%ggbhtg> CLAP MINUS 25 percent
[1:43:36] <dds333a> The only cool thing about Rising Tackle, is that it's part of Rising Force
[1:43:38] <+TopTieramisu> rising tackle is always cool
[1:43:41] <%ggbhtg> @Alexalchemy juuust link it
[1:43:45] <%ggbhtg> here
[1:43:46] <Alexalchemy> Aight
[1:43:49] <TheFinalHazard> more games should have negative guts
[1:43:55] <alexion97> Twitch chat is so f***ing dumb, this is the worst
[1:43:59] <Applecannon63> the spinning bird kick is originally named after Hokuto no ken's counterpart Nanto Hakuroken
[1:44:01] <+TopTieramisu> yo, he's got a diagonal rising tackle
[1:44:01] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @Alexalchemy

[1:51:45] <andre11dr> That costume almost makes me like Blanka
[1:51:46] <BlackermanZX> the best ryu costume
[1:51:59] <dds333a> Reggie PJSalt
[1:51:59] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:52:00] <+MauriceFaurron> Blanka chan is the best
[1:52:07] <@Solidus_113> Blanka Chan or Nergigante
[1:52:09] <Afrosamasenpai> VT1 is temp
[1:52:09] <+TopTieramisu> no bboy ryu WutFace
[1:52:13] <DedlokPM> sbfpBoot syombon his crotch ronanLUL
[1:52:24] <DedlokPM> symbol on*
[1:52:40] <BlackermanZX> maximum hobo ryu should be the default
[1:52:44] <%thedankestmeeme> wait you guys gonna be running sets should i run the update?
[1:52:44] <Josef_Stryker> U just have to hold to counter
[1:52:49] <%jinking79> wasn't it both temporary
[1:53:00] <andre11dr> So i haven't seen this game since arcade edition came out so let's see what they did
[1:53:04] <+samuraiknack> Why is hobo Ryu sexy?
[1:53:14] <Josef_Stryker> It's the beard
[1:53:18] <%ChoculaUltra> defo the beard.
[1:53:24] <Josef_Stryker> Also he's that kind of rugged that looks appealing
[1:53:26] <Applecannon63> its better than plain short haircut
[1:53:26] <%CaptainPileDriver> a real ryu
[1:53:31] <white0devil0> Hobo Ryu but Disco Elysium
[1:53:32] <Josef_Stryker> Especially with him being shirtless
[1:53:43] <%ChoculaUltra> Ryu's design is so fucking bland otherwise but at the same time Capcom can't design a modern costume for shit - for example, Ken.
[1:53:47] <Applecannon63> Like Ryu look good with longer hair
[1:53:48] <DSD24> Ryu has high volition
[1:53:51] <+vaporousTippler> He'd be less sexy if you could smell him.
[1:53:55] <Triplicat> @andre11dr it's still SFV. but there's v-shift now
[1:54:03] <diontmack> still hilarious to me that they added a costume for blanka thats just the nergigante model from mhw
[1:54:07] <%ChoculaUltra> so its literally "shit, slap a beard on him and take off his shirt" but it works so damn well LUL
[1:54:08] <%ggbhtg> V-Shift hits are grey life, huh
[1:54:10] <Knight_Lautrec> this ryu has the same energy as hobo phoenix wright
[1:54:20] <+samuraiknack> A hairy chest would make him god tier
[1:54:25] <JayEarly> @choculaultra at least zeku looks awesome
[1:54:30] <Ethrion> man I hope necalli comes back in the next game
[1:54:31] <+pupil31> This is Ryu if he didn't get invited to Fortnite. Broke af.
[1:54:38] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> game could probably be a smidge louder
[1:54:41] <BlackermanZX> just realied the screen is a bit cropped at the top
[1:54:43] <%ChoculaUltra> @JayEarly you can tell they enjoyed designing Zeku
[1:54:44] <+Cobaltor_252> wait why is the top of the screen cut off
[1:54:50] <%CaptainPileDriver> he died to give us a better ryu woolie
[1:54:53] <Josef_Stryker> Ryu sold the fuck out to become viable
[1:55:05] <Josef_Stryker> First Fortnite, then Power Rangers, and now some mobile game with Kenshiro
[1:55:13] <Applecannon63> I wish they gave longer hair and the only costume to give him something like that is the Kairi costume
[1:55:17] <theredfox930000> freeeeee
[1:55:22] <+xerotwo> AND COOL WATER TOO LUL
[1:55:29] <Josef_Stryker> It's Kicks
[1:55:33] <OldManDeckardCain> watch your feet, woolie KEKW
[1:55:36] <+pupil31> Ryu got a fragrance too LUL
[1:55:37] <Josef_Stryker> Kick for command grab
[1:55:48] <dds333a> Sure isn't, tried for that Shift
[1:56:03] <DaKnightWarrior> That fragrance art is too good LUL
[1:56:05] <+biodomewithpaulyshor> It feels like SFV's artstyle is 30% of the way there to being incredible
[1:56:13] <+biodomewithpaulyshor> Where some characters/stages look incredible and other look downright awful
[1:56:25] <BlackermanZX> like banana hair ken
[1:56:35] <BlackermanZX> a trash masterpiece
[1:56:44] <andre11dr> Necalli could've been do cool, but they where scared to give them an actual instal early on
[1:56:55] <dds333a> @biodomewithpaulyshor that, and the always enduring complaint of everybody having giany hands and feet
[1:57:02] <Josef_Stryker> VT is still permanent in VT2
[1:57:03] <%ggbhtg> @WoolieVersus Round wins are cropped off
[1:57:03] <+TopTieramisu> necalli is the kotal kahn of sfv
[1:57:12] <mattymcfilth> johns?
[1:57:18] <+samuraiknack> Who sexier Hobo Ryu or Mark of the Wolves Terry?
[1:57:21] <dds333a> CarlSmile CarlSmile CarlSmile
[1:57:35] <Applecannon63> Honestly some of character designs in sfv look great accept for Ken
[1:57:35] <+TopTieramisu> motw terry is a single dad
[1:57:40] <+TopTieramisu> extra points
[1:57:44] <%CaptainPileDriver> pick ugly Dan
[1:57:45] <+pupil31> LUL
[1:57:53] <Josef_Stryker> Nah I feel like Nash got done dirty. He should've at least got a visible hit against Bison in story mode.
[1:57:56] <+arknodem> Nergigante
[1:57:57] <%CaptainPileDriver> pick DAN CHAN
[1:57:57] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[1:58:03] <diontmack> NERGI
[1:58:04] <%CaptainPileDriver> pick the Dan doll suit
[1:58:05] <andre11dr> Pick Nergi
[1:58:09] <andre11dr> Booooo
[1:58:10] <+xerotwo> WOULD YOU LIKE SOME PANCAKES
[1:58:13] <Josef_Stryker> How is it the Tengu mask looks both stupid and cool?
[1:58:14] <diontmack> nergi is hialrious please
[1:58:14] <PanicSwytch> Are these Mods or actual costumes?
[1:58:19] <dds333a> OYAJI
[1:58:22] <+TopTieramisu> with all the redesigns in sfv, it's kinda jarring seeing rose's design mostly unchanged
[1:58:26] <+TopTieramisu> though her model looks great
[1:58:27] <Applecannon63> MR KARATE Dan
[1:58:34] <BlackermanZX> these are costumes
[1:58:39] <%ggbhtg> @PanicSwytch SF5 has ten billion in game costumes
[1:58:49] <%ggbhtg> and 9 billion of them are on Chun Li
[1:59:04] <TigerClaws12> danfinite
[1:59:04] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:59:10] <+pupil31> Is Dan better than Ryu in this game?
[1:59:12] <+TopTieramisu> i don't mind juri getting a nice bulk of the costumes
[1:59:23] <%CaptainPileDriver> ex kicks after v skill into ex dash ounch
[1:59:32] <Triplicat> SF5 costume game is admittedly strong
[1:59:32] <Applecannon63> One of Dan's palettes for his Tengu Mask make him look like Dio and that Demon Slayer character
[1:59:36] <Triplicat> like the mega man ones
[1:59:37] <+samuraiknack> Blanka looks like he could use the services of Manscaped
[1:59:45] <OldManDeckardCain> classic blanka robbery
[1:59:54] <diontmack> magic pixel'd
[2:00:14] <+TopTieramisu> i wish cammy's wardrobe was a bit better
[2:00:18] <Applecannon63> The lore battle of Jimmy vs Dan
[2:00:19] <andre11dr> Man something about the animations in this game has always rubbed me the wrong way
[2:00:31] <+MauriceFaurron> Yeah command grab is the best LUL
[2:01:06] <+TopTieramisu> sfv characters flail too much in their movement
[2:01:12] <Darren716> Game audio quiet to anyone else?
[2:01:12] <Applecannon63> The only characters with Weak ass Animations are Falke and Sakura
[2:01:17] <+samuraiknack> Is because they look like they have no weight to them
[2:01:22] <+TopTieramisu> there movements don't feel defined and deliberate enough
[2:01:23] <BlackermanZX> audio is low yeah
[2:01:23] <Lionkevinson> Let‚Äôs see the infinite Reggie
[2:01:29] <Josef_Stryker> Woolie lowered the game volume before he started
[2:01:30] <+TopTieramisu> their*
[2:01:47] <DaKnightWarrior> @darren716 agreed
[2:01:56] <Applecannon63> Falke and Sakura are a great example of uninspired animation
[2:02:08] <%ggbhtg> Game audio is in fact quiet, I didn't wanna be the woolieONEGUY mentioning everything tho
[2:02:22] <BlackermanZX> can ya v shift that
[2:02:25] <+Jiggisnipe> ty Woolie
[2:02:25] <Josef_Stryker> There u go
[2:02:27] <Goblinade> based FAT
[2:02:28] <OldManDeckardCain> knowing frame data is for cowards anyway
[2:02:29] <Darren716> Much better
[2:02:30] <TigerClaws12> sfvsim
[2:02:31] <DaKnightWarrior> better
[2:02:33] <+arknodem> Oh shit. I'ma have to download that.
[2:02:33] <Josef_Stryker> Thanks Woolie SeemsGood
[2:02:40] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yay
[2:02:52] <Josef_Stryker> I hope someone plays Gill
[2:03:02] <DaKnightWarrior> YEEEEEEEAAAHHH!
[2:03:05] <+arknodem> Heck yeah!
[2:03:19] <TigerClaws12> not swimsuit rose DansGame
[2:03:23] <%ggbhtg> That's NOT the voice I was expecting from Blanka OR NErg
[2:03:42] <Applecannon63> I mean the reason why Rose look the same is because time travel
[2:03:44] <+TopTieramisu> lisa lisa
[2:03:55] <%CaptainPileDriver> just straight up Lisa Lisa at this point
[2:03:57] <diontmack> eater of elders in this bitch
[2:03:58] <BlackermanZX> Gill just chillin
[2:04:03] <%ggbhtg> Gillin
[2:04:06] <+TopTieramisu> lisa lisa vs ultimate lifeform kars
[2:04:07] <+FrostedZaibatsu> That costume feels so out of place
[2:04:18] <%jinking79> but Nergi weak to Thunder doodLUL
[2:04:21] <diontmack> @FrostedZaibatsu its literally just hte model from mhw lol
[2:04:28] <DaKnightWarrior> It's so goofy, i love it.
[2:04:29] <%ggbhtg> @FrostedZaibatsu Yeah, Rose could be better Kappa
[2:04:31] <diontmack> which has a whole different artstyle
[2:04:47] <%ChoculaUltra> oh this stage is p sick
[2:04:54] <Applecannon63> Rose's Costume is Joseph Joestar's Battle Tendency outfit
[2:04:57] <+FrostedZaibatsu> @FrostedZaibatsu LUL they just scaled it
[2:05:09] <357Sneak> SourPls
[2:05:10] <+FrostedZaibatsu> @ggbhtg hggLul
[2:06:11] <andre11dr> Oh yeah, love that clipping
[2:06:11] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:06:48] <DaKnightWarrior> Nergigante with the thunder blight!
[2:06:52] <Wan6Saber> @Applecannon63 more like his mom....\
[2:06:56] <KappaMikeyTSF> hell yeah, GIFG SFV
[2:06:58] <diontmack> why did they give blanka a nergi costume when theres another monster that literally does blanka balls
[2:07:13] <+StrawberryPantsu> GENEI JIN!
[2:07:32] <%ggbhtg> well, while mentioning stuff, is Woolie's screen cam blacking out?
[2:07:32] <DaKnightWarrior> Rajang would be perfect for a VS styled game.
[2:07:36] <%ggbhtg> for anyone else?
[2:07:42] <TigerClaws12> inb4 PS delay
[2:07:57] <+Jiggisnipe> just Woolie's goes black?
[2:07:59] <DaKnightWarrior> @ggbhtg yeah it is.
[2:08:06] <Applecannon63> I'm kinda glad that Soul Satelite is a Vskill than a Trigger cause it could be redundant
[2:08:25] <%ggbhtg> Wool cam blacks out, Reg hasn't at all
[2:08:28] <%CaptainPileDriver> do whatever you gotta do to get it better
[2:08:37] <Ethrion> CURSE YOU TV SETTINGS
[2:08:42] <Applecannon63> and that dimension hopping/soul illusion are a great choice of V Triggers
[2:08:45] <KappaMikeyTSF> Soul Satellite as a VS was a weird choice, but I'm glad it's not as busted as Ultra
[2:08:46] <+Jiggisnipe> yea Woolie's always does that, it's not just you
[2:08:51] <andre11dr> That's we need a Capcom All Stars, get the Monster Hunter monsters and have them like the big caracters in TVC
[2:08:53] <@Solidus_113> johns validated
[2:08:57] <diontmack> my tv did that too recently, dont know why game mode turns itself off
[2:09:00] <+Jiggisnipe> something with his frames
[2:09:20] <%CaptainPileDriver> hulk.
[2:09:23] <+StrawberryPantsu> Wow Competitive Brawlhalla sound dogshit
[2:09:33] <%ggbhtg> improvement PogChamp
[2:09:42] <Applecannon63> @kappamikeytsf cause it was originally planned to be a V trigger but the devs decided to change it for Soul Illusion
[2:09:46] <+Jiggisnipe> Ring of Justice PogChamp
[2:09:49] <+TopTieramisu> they give rose a battle tendency outfit but don't give necalli a kars outfit smh
[2:09:55] <+logoth_> Soul Fahk
[2:10:09] <diontmack> ü¶Ä capcom allstars will never exist ü¶Ä
[2:10:13] <%CaptainPileDriver> anyone wanna get some practice sets in before they jump online
[2:10:14] <%ggbhtg> @TopTieramisu Capcom never said he's a Jojo reference tho Kappa
[2:10:20] <Ardisan_> I wish these stages were packed together so I cN buy them
[2:10:21] <+TopTieramisu> @ggbhtg :)
[2:10:29] <Applecannon63> @toptieramisu Cause you already have Kars in the game his name is Gil
[2:10:31] <KappaMikeyTSF> @applecannon63 prob because it'll make Rose feel too samey as Ultra Rose
[2:10:32] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Blanka should've been Rajang. Change my mind.
[2:10:36] <DaKnightWarrior> Nacalli atleast has a Pillerman costume.
[2:10:50] <AstrodropGaming> They made Rose fun for a change
[2:10:58] <%CaptainPileDriver> give rajang to Abigail since he has the running grab that throws you up
[2:10:58] <KeiPrime> no who wants to see MORE rajang
[2:10:59] <%gitgouda> wow these costumes are great
[2:11:08] <+TopTieramisu> sfv cast definitely has a case of fun creep
[2:11:13] <HolyGriddles> !uptime
[2:11:14] <@Moobot> @HolyGriddles WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 21 minutes
[2:11:17] <%ggbhtg> The cray-cray thing about Rose is that she always had that Genei Jin super
[2:11:21] <+TopTieramisu> newer characters seem way more creative and fun than older characters
[2:11:25] <diontmack> @KeiPrime he's fun so I do
[2:11:34] <Ardisan_> Is that actually Sodom, he looks a lot skinnier
[2:11:35] <andre11dr> Lisa Lisa wins
[2:11:38] <diontmack> hes even more fun in Rise now
[2:11:52] <WakeUpThrow> Rajang would fit Blanka like a glove for sure
[2:11:56] <Deimos002> Reggie been playin huh?
[2:12:00] <KeiPrime> fun yeah hahah , trying not to remember 4u

[2:12:40] <fat_burtreynolds> Hamon ftw
[2:12:40] <gruulmagebeast> whose on what side?
[2:12:45] <diontmack> lets hope rise never adds an apex rajang
[2:13:01] <KappaMikeyTSF> @gruulmagebeast Blanka Woolz, Rose Reggie
[2:13:16] <Applecannon63> @ggbhtg the reason it felt obscured cause of Alpha 3 when everyone in that game get that ability as there ISMs

[2:13:22] <gruulmagebeast> @diontmack apex rajang already exists
[2:13:40] <%ggbhtg> @Applecannon63 She had it in Alpha 2
[2:13:43] <%ggbhtg> maybe even 1
[2:13:47] <DaKnightWarrior> @diontmack you know they will. but atleast it wont be 4U Rajang that throws the world at you.
[2:13:49] <%ggbhtg> but no one cares about Alpha 1
[2:14:09] <bigshedman> I care about that three color-colloseum stage LUL
[2:14:11] <Ardisan_> I do
[2:14:16] <KappaMikeyTSF> Blanka-chan outfit is much worse to play against VS regular Blanka, it just hits different
[2:14:18] <fat_burtreynolds> woolieCHAN Get nae Nae‚Äôd
[2:14:29] <Applecannon63> Alpha 3 she has it but because of custom combos ISMs being a thing it was forgettable

[2:18:03] <Darren716> Reggie they're your freaks
[2:18:03] <Monkeyweed21> SFV continues the proud tradition of no one liking the new Street Fighter until the final iteration
[2:18:03] <DaKnightWarrior> Classic Reggie
[2:18:08] <andre11dr> Oh God, i hate that outfit on her
[2:18:08] <gruulmagebeast> helloooooooooooo nurse

[2:18:31] <BlackermanZX> Juri kolSLURP kolBIGBotan
[2:18:42] <TheactualDiepod> Idk this Juri costume is kinda nothing
[2:18:44] <Ardisan_> Ed doesnt ever look cool, not even as Nero
[2:18:44] <%ggbhtg> Sheesh, Ed doesn't deserve a Nero costume
[2:18:51] <Bazal68k> The stand is a nice touch.
[2:18:55] <fat_burtreynolds> That fuggin nero jacket tho psaSkelmo psaSkelmo psaSkelmo
[2:18:57] <andre11dr> I do love the jacket they gave her with her old costume, i think that one looks great
[2:19:00] <+Exicuren> Dayum
[2:19:01] <+TopTieramisu> you know juri's here to stay when even in with her worst iteration gameplay-wise, she still gets a healthy wardrobe
[2:19:02] <TigerClaws12> naw
[2:19:05] <eldragon_1> All her new costumes are great
[2:19:05] <DSD24> @TheactualDiepod She's got a bunch of other winners though
[2:19:11] <%CaptainPileDriver> I've been playing Reggie every once in awhile and fuck is falke awful
[2:19:11] <andre11dr> But she has a lot of dumb costumes
[2:19:13] <Monkeyweed21> wow Reggie is really good with this character for degenerates
[2:19:24] <+samuraiknack> Why is Daryll Hannah in Street Fighter?
[2:19:34] <FunnyCrimes> @CaptainPileDriver i wanted to like falke so bad lol
[2:19:41] <%Deft_Thought> Flicker buffs are nice on Ed.
[2:19:42] <+TopTieramisu> i don't think any character has a flawless wardrobe
[2:19:42] <%AlteisenReiseZ> I picked a winner and stuck with Dictator through and through
[2:19:47] <%ggbhtg> You picked NURSE Juri before BANCHO Juri? Smh my head Reg @WoolieVersus
[2:19:49] <%CaptainPileDriver> hey Reggie hold up light kick and 3 punches before the match starts
[2:19:53] <%Feifong_wong> Feifong_wong subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months!
[2:19:59] <HolyGriddles> Falke has some decent skins at least
[2:20:00] <Applecannon63> Tbh I hate Ed's Idle Stance
[2:20:00] <he1lhydra> @WoolieVersus also v-trigger 2 can't be v-reversaled
[2:20:00] <+Swerto> I miss SFIV Juri. Never could get into her V version
[2:20:03] <+TopTieramisu> he won't pick bancho because she wears shoes
[2:20:07] <+Swerto> No dive kick makes me a sad panda
[2:20:10] <%CaptainPileDriver> use the costume code
[2:20:11] <DedlokPM> FEET woolieKICKDAD

[2:20:36] <%ggbhtg> Sheeeesh
[2:20:42] <%CaptainPileDriver> hold those buttons
[2:20:43] <Josef_Stryker> God it looks so terrible on him
[2:20:46] <primaryfire> remember the alt costumes
[2:20:47] <Applecannon63> reason why his stance sucks cause of his hunched legs
[2:20:53] <HolyGriddles> Costume code for Demetri is awful. DO IT!

[2:21:27] <+froduck42> Did they pitch up Boscoes voice for ED?
[2:21:29] <%CaptainPileDriver> everyone does on certain costumes
[2:21:33] <%ggbhtg> so what does the costume code do?
[2:21:34] <TheactualDiepod> I never understand putting fighting game girls in dresses
[2:21:37] <+Swerto> OH my god I forgot how bad the Juri V theme is
[2:21:40] <DSD24> I wish Ed was slim like he was before
[2:21:43] <Monkeyweed21> psycho flicker is much faster and safer now too
[2:21:57] <Ardisan_> @theactualdiepod Its a video game
[2:21:58] <+toastybites> @TheactualDiepod japan and high kicks
[2:22:00] <kingkos64> juri asking where to break me wearing a nurse custom sexy
[2:22:03] <andre11dr> Yeah SFV went hard on fetish of Juri ,i feel like she was more of a cool caracter in SF4
[2:22:04] <DaKnightWarrior> @swerto it's so boring
[2:22:06] <eldragon_1> Code gives her the horn hair
[2:22:23] <he1lhydra> kicks is frame 4 anti air
[2:22:39] <%ggbhtg> @eldragon_1 and Dimitri?
[2:22:51] <kingkos64> @andre11dr dude i agree
[2:22:58] <Saltmeisterr> oh god is that juri's theme playing?
[2:22:59] <+Swerto> The characters I enjoyed in IV just playing so different in V is what kept me from getting into it for season 1/2. Sakura was at least fun.
[2:23:07] <%Deft_Thought> Bad bet with that uppercut
[2:23:09] <FunnyCrimes> hey chat are there any characters that are close to AC+R bridget or kof13 ralf in SFV
[2:23:21] <%Deft_Thought> Hmm
[2:23:22] <Ardisan_> No
[2:23:25] <%Deft_Thought> Nah
[2:23:30] <%CaptainPileDriver> no
[2:23:30] <TigerClaws12> No
[2:23:30] <fat_burtreynolds> Is Cody still in sf5?
[2:23:34] <%CaptainPileDriver> this is sfv
[2:23:34] <FunnyCrimes> dam
[2:23:40] <TheactualDiepod> @Ardisan_ not really a point but ok
[2:23:41] <$PaulToon> Cheer1000 Bits for victory!
[2:23:49] <TigerClaws12> no fun allowed in sfv, even after all the updates LUL
[2:23:50] <Applecannon63> Cody is still good in SFV
[2:23:51] <%Deft_Thought> Well, Alex has some Ralf shit but not really
[2:23:55] <ZegarWildheart> Howdy Woolie
[2:23:55] <Monkeyweed21> @fat_burtreynolds yea they gave him Haggar's pipe as a vtrigger
[2:24:10] <FunnyCrimes> those are two of my fave chars lol
[2:24:23] <%Deft_Thought> Cody's knife got a bit better
[2:24:31] <Applecannon63> Alex got a reasonable buff with his Vskill 2
[2:24:31] <leto_ii_muadibadder> juri nurse outfit üòØ
[2:24:32] <fat_burtreynolds> Yesssssss. Looks like I gotta make room on my console for sf5 then
[2:24:49] <andre11dr> @funnycrimes Yeah this is a very grounded game and Bridget is like the opposite of a grounded caracter LUL
[2:25:17] <Ardisan_> @theactualdiepod Yes it is. In fiction characters can fight in anything and that wouldnt impact them at all.
[2:25:19] <Applecannon63> Alex's Vtrigger 1 is so good with the parry/clothesline attack
[2:25:40] <fat_burtreynolds> Juri Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[2:25:42] <eldragon_1> Reggie doing best girl justice
[2:25:45] <%Deft_Thought> V Trigger 2 on Alex is a lot more useful in a variety of matchups now too
[2:25:55] <Ardisan_> @theactualdiepod Do you question how iori fights with leg straps
[2:25:56] <%Deft_Thought> I still think VT1 is more all purpose
[2:25:57] <FunnyCrimes> i mean i also really like how ralf's gut punch links feel in kof13
[2:25:58] <DSD24> Is online going to be a lot of people picking training stage?
[2:26:07] <BlackermanZX> damn theres some cool alt costumes codes
[2:26:23] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yo that costume
[2:26:28] <Asuterisuku> Oh hey, Ed has Woolie colours.
[2:26:35] <DSD24> He its 2B
[2:26:35] <TheactualDiepod> I'm not talking about function, Im asking for them to wear something cool
[2:26:44] <HolyGriddles> Costume code actually gives her bikini
[2:26:50] <DSD24> Something that looks cool that fits in a fight
[2:26:53] <andre11dr> Ok ,am i crazy or does anyone else found Falke super lame?
[2:26:59] <Applecannon63> I just wish they didn't demote Alex's Stungun Headbut into a special move
[2:27:10] <%Deft_Thought> @Applecannon63 Me too
[2:27:45] <Saltmeisterr> CatJAM
[2:27:45] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:27:47] <Applecannon63> his headbutt should've been like his old command normal
[2:27:47] <%Deft_Thought> It does feel frustrating at times that characters have chunks of their movelist gated by the VT system
[2:27:53] <Ardisan_> I only like Falkes cat costume because we need more Breath of Fire love
[2:28:01] <%Deft_Thought> I do think it works and got used it over time
[2:28:02] <Asuterisuku> I haven't seen this stage before... Venice is beautiful!
[2:28:02] <bigshedman> Falke is lame in every department. Even her German sucks.
[2:28:31] <%Deft_Thought> @Ardisan_ I miss BoF so damn much.
[2:28:46] <Applecannon63> Hey don't blame the va but the voice director
[2:28:55] <gruulmagebeast> quick reggie unleash the costume code
[2:29:00] <%Deft_Thought> I legit think BoF: Dragon Quarter is a cool ass game, it just isn't a great Breath of Fire game
[2:29:06] <%CaptainPileDriver> costume COOODE
[2:29:16] <Ardisan_> im playing Dragon quarter rn @deft_thought
[2:29:19] <fat_burtreynolds> Yeah that German ain‚Äôt great
[2:29:24] <andre11dr> Like she's just pantsless girl with stick ,i don't see the hype
[2:29:26] <Ardisan_> kinda reminds me of SMT
[2:29:29] <KahnWick> I wish Ed's Nero costume had Nero's hair, just looks off without it
[2:29:29] <%Deft_Thought> Word!
[2:29:30] <Asuterisuku> I would love to see BoF beyond 2 to be ported to modern systems.
[2:29:31] <%ggbhtg> maybe actually post the code again?
[2:29:51] <Asuterisuku> ... And it's a shame the english translation of 2 sucks.
[2:29:52] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's hold up light kick and all 3 punches before the round starts
[2:29:59] <TheactualDiepod> I doubt they're worried about the costume code guys
[2:30:02] <leto_ii_muadibadder> falke CrreamAwk
[2:30:16] <%Deft_Thought> The setting is cool as hell. I really like the world of Dragon Quarter. It's just antithetical to the playstyle of the series
[2:30:16] <fat_burtreynolds> Falke feet Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[2:30:19] <kingkos64> man capcom really going for it with sex appeal sells in costumes
[2:30:24] <HolyGriddles> Up, light kick, three punches = bikini Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[2:30:26] <+MoroseLoki> Is that an Alternate Costume for Falke I haven't played enough of this game to remember Default looks
[2:30:40] <andre11dr> At least SFV newcomers where better than the SF4 ones
[2:30:41] <%Deft_Thought> Which is fine but I wonder if it would have done better commercially if it wasn't a Breath of Fire game
[2:30:43] <DSD24> I like her Hat
[2:30:43] <@Menitta> I dont like Falke nearly as much as Ed
[2:30:49] <Applecannon63> Her animation feel ver static in a bland kind of way
[2:30:53] <%ggbhtg> requests are taken sometimes, for as much as the Twitch started off as "we don't read chat", especially on the fighting game streams @TheactualDiepod
[2:30:59] <Josef_Stryker> I just really wish Abigail wasn't our Canadian rep
[2:31:00] <Ardisan_> @theactualdiepod Not everything needs to look cool, thats boring. We wouldn't of got Blanka chan if everything needed to look cool
[2:31:06] <PerfidiousSinn> @MoroseLoki it's an alternate, her default is a military costume
[2:31:22] <gruulmagebeast> ed fun to play its a shame hes so ugly though
[2:31:29] <BlackermanZX> i forgot falke existed
[2:31:32] <%Deft_Thought> @Menitta I think her gameplay is pretty dope for a zoner. I like the way she controls space but I don't like the input system for her or Ed.
[2:31:41] <fat_burtreynolds> My boy may be ugly, but he is Stronk
[2:31:50] <andre11dr> As bad as Abigail is ,I'll take him anyday over Rufus or Able
[2:31:55] <@Menitta> I think the input system works much more for Ed than Falke
[2:32:03] <Ardisan_> I like Cody but his mocappy movement puts me off, but it is what it is
[2:32:10] <Applecannon63> I do hope the reboot of Street fighter 6/Alpha 4 does justice with Ed and Falke
[2:32:10] <%Deft_Thought> Boo! Bring back Abel! Gimme my wheel kicks!
[2:32:12] <%ggbhtg> Sometimes somebody has to shout out some obscure fight game tech for them to do it, but "who cares" is also valid
[2:32:17] <%ggbhtg> FORRRRRE btw
[2:32:17] <leto_ii_muadibadder> gptvSCREAM
[2:32:19] <Deko_> bonk
[2:32:24] <%Deft_Thought> I miss counterhit Cody from SFIV.
[2:32:29] <%ggbhtg> jaboodyBONK jaboodyBONK jaboodyBONK
[2:32:29] <$emerald_poison> He's been holding back
[2:32:48] <+MoroseLoki> ok ok Thought so @perfidioussinn Makes sense she came out at the same time as Ed right? oof I forgot about Abigail Ha I remember I played Abel back in SF4
[2:32:54] <%CaptainPileDriver> no
[2:32:57] <TheactualDiepod> @Ardisan_ Woolie just expressed how blanka chan is cool to him. So that falls apart. Giving the characters at least one interesting costume that isnt just a bikini or a dress would be nice
[2:32:58] <+MauriceFaurron> I do LUL
[2:32:58] <Iwashi94> I miss SFIV Juri :(
[2:32:59] <fat_burtreynolds> Dlc feet pic of Falke how much? psaGib
[2:33:00] <Josef_Stryker> I have one.
[2:33:08] <%ggbhtg> Up, light kick, three punches = Costume modifier, according to chat legend
[2:33:23] <%Deft_Thought> Reggie pickin a Cop DansGame
[2:33:23] <muXPerience> KAGE
[2:33:26] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Lucia is pretty fun
[2:33:27] <PerfidiousSinn> costume code is crucial
[2:33:29] <atgithursdays> Has woolie addressed the recent goings on?
[2:33:30] <leto_ii_muadibadder> blanka chan CrreamAwk
[2:33:32] <Fist_Wizard_Jay> G may just be Q, but he is my favorite character out of this whole game
[2:33:33] <PerfidiousSinn> costume code can turn bad costumes good
[2:33:34] <@Menitta> Lucia is super fun
[2:33:51] <Ardisan_> @theactualdiepod Blanka Chan was designed to cute, not cool.
[2:33:54] <%Deft_Thought> G is fantastic. He looks so cool in motion
[2:33:58] <357Sneak> SourPls
[2:33:59] <primaryfire> damn the lame costume
[2:34:06] <gruulmagebeast> lucia is fun shes who i mainly play
[2:34:08] <%Deft_Thought> How do those shorts even work
[2:34:15] <bigshedman> G felt like the turning point of characters playing and looking fun
[2:34:18] <Saltmeisterr> oooh
[2:34:23] <fat_burtreynolds> Jeankini
[2:34:24] <Saltmeisterr> arcing projectile
[2:34:42] <DaKnightWarrior> G has so much personality.
[2:34:49] <BlackermanZX> alt costume removes the jacket kolSLURP
[2:34:49] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:34:55] <gruulmagebeast> reggie you can also do crouching light into v skill
[2:34:58] <%Deft_Thought> He's the president of the world!
[2:34:59] <+VariantX7> I still wonder if humanity has gone too far by giving Blanka a command grab
[2:35:00] <PerfidiousSinn> Lucia is cool but I refuse to play a c*p
[2:35:02] <Saltmeisterr> @DaKnightWarrior ITS SUPER TUESDAY
[2:35:03] <%Deft_Thought> Gotta have personality
[2:35:09] <TheactualDiepod> @Ardisan_ That wasnt the only thing I said in my last response
[2:35:13] <Applecannon63> G's Skullomania costume has a cool code ver were its straight Street fighter EX's design
[2:35:48] <fat_burtreynolds> Blank Chan getting some Noms LUL
[2:35:48] <ayzee000> Whoa we're revisiting SFV???
[2:36:00] <DaKnightWarrior> @saltmeisterr so good LUL
[2:36:06] <Applecannon63> Honestly Blankchan is peak design
[2:36:08] <Ardisan_> @theactualdiepod Well for your other response, stop being a party pooper and let people enjoy their bikini outfits that they were put in for.
[2:36:27] <Applecannon63> oh jeez horny on main with chat
[2:36:33] <PerfidiousSinn> since when was Reggie a beast at this game?
[2:36:34] <%ggbhtg> it's like that huh @Ardisan_
[2:36:48] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> remember, this channel is a no kinkshaming zone
[2:36:55] <+MoroseLoki> SFV stays Horny where ya been
[2:36:56] <Saltmeisterr> So whats lucia deal? what else she got
[2:37:06] <BlackermanZX> i'm convinced blanka chan is the best costume
[2:37:18] <AstrodropGaming> Peeps are refusing to contain their horny I see
[2:37:20] <PerfidiousSinn> @Saltmeisterr run cancels like El fuerte and arcing fireballs
[2:37:23] <BlackermanZX> peak blanka costume
[2:37:31] <leith_aziz> Hi chat
[2:37:32] <@Menitta> The only thing I dont like about Blanka Chan is the material looks like the cheapest fabric one can get
[2:37:32] <TheactualDiepod> @Ardisan_ Yeah criticizing horny is a waste of effort. I'm not gonna change my opinion on that tho bruh
[2:37:40] <PerfidiousSinn> yeah Blanka Chan is absolutely the greatest Blanka costume ever made
[2:37:41] <fat_burtreynolds> woolieCHAN woolieCHAN woolieCHAN I need one
[2:37:42] <+Jiggisnipe> BlankaChan is Blanka's true form, don't run from it
[2:37:44] <Ardisan_> Fine
[2:37:50] <+samuraiknack> *points at Blanka player*Human You dare call that thing human?
[2:37:55] <@Menitta> but thats SFV muddy textures
[2:38:01] <+MoroseLoki> Just look at Blanka Chan How you not all over that Kreygasm Kreygasm
[2:38:08] <@Menitta> woolieCHAN
[2:38:16] <Applecannon63> His Name is JIMMY
[2:38:17] <andre11dr> I will say, SF has always been sexual
[2:38:24] <%Deft_Thought> Blanka the anarchist
[2:38:32] <+CookieCutter007> that muddy dump track
[2:38:46] <%Deft_Thought> "In the jungle, you don't have Police to protect you. You protect yourself" -Comrade Blanka-chan
[2:38:46] <andre11dr> Ever since Camy and her camel toe
[2:38:50] <+CookieCutter007> i'm a idiot FeelsBadMan
[2:38:58] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Urien in undies is peak SFV lewd
[2:38:59] <leith_aziz> Anyone here had an issue where their DS4 controller had their D-pad button get stuck? This is like the 3rd controller where this has happened now
[2:39:16] <Applecannon63> same goes of Gil
[2:39:20] <PerfidiousSinn> @leith_aziz my last DS4 did that and it happened to a friend as well
[2:39:28] <PerfidiousSinn> I think the Dualshock 4 quality has been getting worse recently
[2:39:29] <%ggbhtg> ouchers
[2:39:30] <@Menitta> ooh jabbed out into v trigger
[2:39:31] <%CaptainPileDriver> I don't have that issue, mine just end up having fucked left sticks
[2:39:46] <PerfidiousSinn> my current DS4 has horrible stick drift on the right stick too :)
[2:39:47] <%CaptainPileDriver> and they have
[2:40:02] <%ggbhtg> right stick drift NotLikeThis
[2:40:02] <bigshedman> Yup, same here, holding straight up on the left stick just does nothing now.
[2:40:03] <%CaptainPileDriver> the controllers are way shittier now than they used to be
[2:40:10] <Josef_Stryker> I'm just fortunate I have a friend who could fix my controllers
[2:40:12] <%hologram_sam> 69 everytime
[2:40:21] <Applecannon63> Do hope Akira's costumes are interesting like maybe have her brother's bancho outfit
[2:40:23] <%CaptainPileDriver> I'm ready
[2:40:27] <+MoroseLoki> Controller problems oof
[2:40:28] <EX_shuffle> I always get a dead spot at the top of the ds4 left stick
[2:40:42] <leith_aziz> Well, I tried searching how to fix it and it hasnt worked. Dammit, I dont wanna spend 60 dollars on a damn controller. Strive is like in 2 months man...
[2:40:51] <Ethrion> so that's why I felt lucia's VA sounded famillair she's android 21 from dragon ball
[2:40:51] <Applecannon63> But of course the best design of Akira is her Biker outfit
[2:41:04] <%hologram_sam> O. Honda
[2:41:07] <%Deft_Thought> Honda OP
[2:41:09] <@Menitta> Did they pick Kolin at all
[2:41:10] <leto_ii_muadibadder> go honda GlitchNRG
[2:41:15] <@Menitta> I dig Kolin
[2:41:17] <%CaptainPileDriver> no @menitta
[2:41:19] <EX_shuffle> Blow into it and swirl the stick ,it's a dirty contact
[2:41:23] <Applecannon63> Honda you mean Kenshiro as a Sumo
[2:41:27] <EX_shuffle> Usually
[2:41:27] <andre11dr> Oh god ,i forgot Honda was in this game LUL
[2:41:27] <leith_aziz> Daigo's pocket main. Lets go
[2:41:29] <primaryfire> rose already has more costumes than necalli
[2:41:31] <Josef_Stryker> Honda cmeisterAngry
[2:41:37] <Afrosamasenpai> DOSKOI
[2:41:38] <+Exicuren> I have a quite old DS4, I fixed the sitck drift by opening it and clean the potentiometers, there's no other solution, sadly
[2:41:40] <$emerald_poison> He's called E. Honda, not O. Honda
[2:41:49] <muXPerience> He gets the suit with scarf just like Ganryu. Are those just inoki references?
[2:41:54] <%CaptainPileDriver> anyone who picks menat is a bad human and should be flogged in the streets
[2:41:55] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1386952720297381894?s=19
[2:42:10] <%Deft_Thought> King jobber is here! Go go, Necalli-chan!
[2:42:10] <leith_aziz> This stage is pretty sick alongside the music
[2:42:12] <Ardisan_> im surprised Honda was popular enough to be put as DLC
[2:42:16] <Applecannon63> Honestly Why isn't E.Honda a Yakuza!?
[2:42:20] <Ardisan_> never knew
[2:42:22] <andre11dr> Why would they bring back Honda ,who cares about him LUL
[2:42:23] <Iwashi94> the bitrate tho
[2:42:29] <+Jiggisnipe> Mike Ross
[2:42:36] <%ggbhtg> Because he was in SF2 :)
[2:42:38] <leto_ii_muadibadder> Jebaited LUL
[2:42:40] <plushysceptile> I keep forgetting Nicali exists
[2:42:52] <+MoroseLoki> Menat has that walk though
[2:42:53] <plushysceptile> *Necalli
[2:43:07] <$emerald_poison> He got added around the same time as Ganyru in tekken
[2:43:10] <%Deft_Thought> Necalli ain't coming back so that's fine
[2:43:11] <Applecannon63> Cause that suit that E honda is wearing makes him a Yakuza
[2:43:13] <andre11dr> @jiggisnipe But isn't Mike Ross a ghost now or something
[2:43:14] <Iwashi94> so was Necalli designed just to show off hair tech? lol
[2:43:17] <leith_aziz> @Ardisan_: OG characters tend to become popular enough. Though personally, I find E.Honda boring
[2:43:27] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> god I wish I liked Menat's playstyle Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[2:43:30] <$emerald_poison> Nak
[2:43:37] <%Deft_Thought> I hope Zeku sticks around. He's fun as hell now that his stance switching is a real thing
[2:43:55] <%Deft_Thought> As much as I would love to see Guy again
[2:43:59] <leith_aziz> @Deft_Thought: Hell yeah. Zeku rocks
[2:44:21] <@Menitta> I'm excited to try Akira.
[2:44:25] <leith_aziz> Necalli is basically an NRS jobber now that I think about it
[2:44:29] <%Deft_Thought> Lucia kinda fills the Guy roll with her run
[2:44:30] <Applecannon63> Instead of Guy returning why not Maki?
[2:44:38] <%Deft_Thought> Necalli = Kotal Khan
[2:44:43] <+Jiggisnipe> @andre11dr he actually streams Dota2 alot now and was just in WNF for SF recently
[2:44:45] <leith_aziz> oof
[2:44:48] <bigshedman> They're both jobbers LUL
[2:44:52] <@Menitta> Necali jobbed harder than Kotal
[2:44:54] <leto_ii_muadibadder> LUL
[2:44:55] <%Deft_Thought> "Whoa, who is this dangerous ancient man--Oh, I beat his ass and he turned to clay."
[2:44:57] <%ggbhtg> chuckstered
[2:44:57] <Ardisan_> Akira made me buy SFV
[2:44:57] <@Menitta> which is impressive
[2:44:59] <Applecannon63> Maki would be perfect to return in SF6
[2:45:03] <Ardisan_> Im enjoying SFV alot
[2:45:08] <BlackermanZX> damn the jin saotome costume code for ryu is just ryu in his undies
[2:45:09] <+MoroseLoki> oh Man I hate How they did Kotal Kahn.
[2:45:25] <Applecannon63> @blackermanzx thats awesome
[2:45:45] <%ggbhtg> @BlackermanZX which is a multi layered reference
[2:45:51] <@Menitta> I really wish the rumor/speculation of Necali was real where therer'd be a full tribe of people with the Satsui no hado
[2:45:57] <Applecannon63> FUNDOSHI RYU is best costume
[2:46:05] <WakeUpThrow> Kotal's worst defeat was *off screen*, I don't think that can be topped even by Necalli
[2:46:05] <LordOfThePoultry> how has his suit not split yet
[2:46:09] <leith_aziz> I did enjoy my little time with SFV as Zeku and G. And even though my matches against people had no noticable net issues, I still want the game to put proper rollback to motivate me to play
[2:46:10] <andre11dr> I actually played Kotal in X ,the did him si dirty in 11
[2:46:11] <Ardisan_> @menitta Aw man, I want that
[2:46:20] <DaKnightWarrior> A butterfly took thst punch better then necalli.
[2:46:53] <%ggbhtg> sheeeesh
[2:46:58] <%ggbhtg> the chucks
[2:47:17] <mrjplays2k9> honda so dumb in this game lol
[2:47:27] <Applecannon63> dumb fun
[2:47:43] <leith_aziz> Oh, Kage.......
[2:47:46] <%ggbhtg> the ribbing room Kage
[2:47:54] <BlackermanZX> Asura's wrath kage tho
[2:47:56] <@Menitta> the stupid horns ruin Kage's design
[2:47:57] <%Deft_Thought> @leith_aziz I really want to get back into SFV and fighting games in general. The game feels real good right now.
[2:48:03] <%Deft_Thought> Haven't touched online though
[2:48:12] <mrjplays2k9> where does everyone like to play kage? In the home or the room or the living room?
[2:48:14] <Ardisan_> Who is Kage
[2:48:15] <Applecannon63> I wish Kage was a better a Oni
[2:48:21] <Josef_Stryker> Just brace urself if u touch online
[2:48:24] <+SignScratch> online starts getting way better past gold
[2:48:30] <gruulmagebeast> theres water on the floor blanka has the advantage
[2:48:33] <andre11dr> Yeah Kage really didn't need those horns
[2:48:34] <Josef_Stryker> This game has rollback but it's not good rollback
[2:48:35] <bigshedman> @mrjplays2k9 Definitely the ribbingu room LUL
[2:48:52] <@Menitta> my SFV experience has been boiled down to playing with my one friend who has this gamew
[2:48:53] <leith_aziz> Honestly, I felt that Kage/Evil Ryu was always a pointless concept since Akuma existed as Ryu's dark reflection
[2:48:57] <+Catbrainz> dat skin tho
[2:48:58] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:49:04] <andre11dr> The bandana as the scarf is cool visual tho
[2:49:05] <Josef_Stryker> LUL
[2:49:05] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[2:49:05] <gruulmagebeast> THERE IS NO ESCAPE
[2:49:05] <Applecannon63> Kage got better apparently he plays like a Guilty Gear character
[2:49:05] <DaKnightWarrior> IT NEVER ENDS
[2:49:06] <%ggbhtg> sheeeeeeeeesh
[2:49:11] <Goblinade> LUL
[2:49:18] <%Deft_Thought> I can't set up an ethernet connection in my current apartment. Haven't been playing fighters since I moved here almost a year ago
[2:49:22] <+SignScratch> scumbag blankas lol
[2:49:31] <Ardisan_> While I want grest rollback as anyone, of my first impressions I luckily didnt get any laggy matches.
[2:49:37] <he1lhydra> don't talk to blanka players, don't make eye contact with blanka players, don't shake blanka player's hands
[2:49:44] <%Deft_Thought> ^
[2:49:45] <+Jiggisnipe> Reggie move away from Woolie, his Blanka stench will get on you
[2:49:46] <Applecannon63> Kage'a V skill 2 is wild
[2:49:53] <leith_aziz> @Deft_Thought: Games with good rollback netcode will mitigate WiFi. Trust me as someone who played the Strive beta
[2:50:01] <+MoroseLoki> üòÜ ü§£ Blanka Stench
[2:50:19] <%Deft_Thought> @leith_aziz I had some decent matches with some friends on Xrd, I just don't want to be "That Guy"
[2:50:24] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yeah as long as the game has rollback ethernet is not as much of a requirement
[2:50:36] <Applecannon63> Kage'a fire ball is trying to be like Ryo's fire ball
[2:50:56] <thatjuantoo> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ On god? LUL

[2:50:57] <Ardisan_> @leith_aziz I tested it with +R and I got mostly laggy matches. prob depends
[2:50:58] <+Jiggisnipe> @Deft_Thought Xrd is delay-based. If you try Strive, I think you'll be fine on wifi. Good rollback can compensate for alot of stuff
[2:51:18] <leith_aziz> @Deft_Thought: I play delay based games too. Have 400 hours on Xrd and am currently playing DBFZ while waiting for Strive
[2:51:19] <+MoroseLoki> Dddude
[2:51:24] <@Menitta> during the beta I didnt have a single bad match in Strive
[2:51:25] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[2:51:27] <Applecannon63> LETS GO KAGE
[2:51:27] <Josef_Stryker> LUL
[2:51:31] <Applecannon63> aw
[2:51:37] <Goblinade> CHEAP
[2:51:42] <FunnyCrimes> i had like 1 laggy match during the strive beta
[2:51:50] <%ggbhtg> Actually *pauses for a sec* ....BITCH LUL
[2:51:55] <leith_aziz> @Ardisan_: I guess it depends on who you fought. Though +R was really not made with rollback in mind, which causes some issues
[2:52:00] <%Deft_Thought> It's lame, y'all. I live in an apartment that's the second floor of a house in Brooklyn. The Cable company doesn't register it as an apartment (even though the power/gas companies do), so even if I call them, they won't come out.
[2:52:34] <+MoroseLoki> Oh man Glad I actually caught a stream live üòÜ Just came Woolie Versus YouTube
[2:53:04] <Applecannon63> Out footsie
[2:53:26] <+MoroseLoki> @deft_thought eff them cable companies üôÑ
[2:53:32] <Ardisan_> @leith_aziz What makes that weirder is when I play kof 2k2UM on steam, its flawless
[2:53:53] <+OroOreo> The K brad
[2:53:53] <Josef_Stryker> LUL
[2:53:53] <Applecannon63> Wow
[2:54:24] <leith_aziz> @Ardisan_: To be fair, that was made by code mystics, an experienced team, while +R's netcode was first worked on by Modders, then Arcsys decided to help them out and then hire em
[2:54:28] <Josef_Stryker> YEYEYEYEYE
[2:54:28] <+Jiggisnipe> right in the eye Kappa
[2:54:42] <%Deft_Thought> Man, Kage's super is so lame compared to SFIV E. Ryu
[2:54:42] <%CaptainPileDriver> let's go online
[2:54:43] <DaKnightWarrior> That super needs more impact.
[2:54:49] <BlackermanZX> man kage looks dumb af LUL
[2:55:04] <FunnyCrimes> single hit KoF confirms ukogRIP
[2:55:09] <andre11dr> He really does
[2:55:15] <+Jiggisnipe> SFV designs are really hit or miss
[2:55:23] <%Deft_Thought> He knees you in the abdomen. Come on.
[2:55:25] <+Jiggisnipe> I'm still not feeling lion Akuma
[2:55:25] <Ardisan_> @leith_aziz Oh okay. I'll try Strive this coming beta to see difference.
[2:55:27] <Applecannon63> Kage'a only good super is that raging demon
[2:55:28] <andre11dr> Is the teeth and the horns
[2:55:32] <%Deft_Thought> Him and Gief have some doodoo supers
[2:55:40] <BlackermanZX> i much prefer sf4 Evil Ryu's design
[2:55:45] <primaryfire> never thought about looking at the healthbar to hitconfirm
[2:55:47] <leith_aziz> Well, if I cant fix my controller tommorow, then I'll probably have to buy my 4th controller now. There goes another 60$ off my wallet...
[2:55:54] <%ggbhtg> spoken like a true Chex Mixer
[2:55:56] <he1lhydra> reggie the liar lying to win
[2:56:04] <Applecannon63> honestly the horns would've looked if they were just energy based
[2:56:04] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:56:08] <+clapbeat> reggies is super good in this game damn
[2:56:16] <Applecannon63> *looked better
[2:56:20] <%Deft_Thought> There's some all right shit going on with Kage's design but crater-in-my-chest Evil Ryu is gonna do it for me
[2:56:20] <%ggbhtg> @he1lhydra he lied to himself too, it's fair Kappa
[2:56:39] <%Deft_Thought> GOTTEM
[2:56:40] <DaKnightWarrior> LUL
[2:56:42] <leith_aziz> GG
[2:56:45] <Ardisan_> the horns would look better if it shaded to blend with hair so it doesnt look like a attachment
[2:56:46] <BlackermanZX> Blanka'd
[2:56:47] <Applecannon63> Kage'a early artwork looked so good
[2:56:49] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[2:56:49] <%Deft_Thought> Filthy Blanka play ü§¢ \
[2:56:52] <Josef_Stryker> LUL
[2:57:03] <andre11dr> Oni definitely a much better demon design ,probably because he was a straight up Dragon Ball caracter
[2:57:32] <%Deft_Thought> I played Oni a lot. I'm not ashamed to say it
[2:57:40] <leith_aziz> To me, Evil Ryu is just a bootleg Akuma. So he's not that much better than Kage, and Akuma already works as a dark reflection of Ryu
[2:57:50] <Ardisan_> I like Kages version of tatsu
[2:57:57] <%ggbhtg> One may say that Reggie does in fact "Play dis game"
[2:58:02] <%Deft_Thought> E. Ryu just had some cool ass combos in IV. That's what I loved
[2:58:03] <%ggbhtg> Studies show
[2:58:10] <DaKnightWarrior> Oni is fun.
[2:58:18] <leith_aziz> Yeah, E.Ryu had some cool tech
[2:58:43] <%Deft_Thought> I wish Makoto had found her way in
[2:58:47] <%Deft_Thought> I miss her a lot
[2:58:50] <leith_aziz> That Raging Demon mixup I see constantly in Evo compilations
[2:58:51] <+Vestillion> still no makoto, I'm still not interested.
[2:58:58] <%CaptainPileDriver> NOOOO NO KARIN
[2:58:59] <BlackermanZX> Makoto FeelsBadMan
[2:59:02] <Ardisan_> I miss Elena but everyone hates her...
[2:59:11] <Fist_Wizard_Jay> Where the G fans at
[2:59:15] <Ardisan_> dont even care about healing
[2:59:29] <andre11dr> Fuck Elena, keep that bitch out
[2:59:30] <%jinking79> I'm gonna be that one Necro fan
[2:59:35] <Applecannon63> @ardisan_ remove her healing move than she'd be acceptable
[2:59:35] <%Deft_Thought> Does Reggie have stance switching combos!? woolieKICKDAD
[2:59:38] <Ardisan_> BibleThump
[2:59:43] <+Vestillion> I will absolutely be one of those makoto stans
[2:59:45] <leith_aziz> Is Makoto like the Baiken of SF? (this coming from someone who actually bothered to learn her enough to make her a pocket main)
[2:59:48] <+clapbeat> zeku only gets buffed every patch
[2:59:56] <Monkeyweed21> Zeku keeps getting better
[3:00:06] <%Deft_Thought> V-Skill 1? My man is suspect. cmonBruh
[3:00:12] <leith_aziz> Man, I love Zeku
[3:00:26] <%Deft_Thought> I wanna see them weasel summons!
[3:00:28] <leith_aziz> His animations are beatiful
[3:00:29] <Ardisan_> New SfV would revamo Elena so yall would love her instead of hate her.
[3:00:29] <+SignScratch> Isn't Zeku dating Laura?
[3:00:35] <Ardisan_> revamp*
[3:00:40] <+MoroseLoki> Strider?
[3:00:43] <%jinking79> i wish u could choose Young or Old Zeku at character select
[3:00:52] <+MoroseLoki> I forgot about Zeku ü§£
[3:00:56] <andre11dr> Of course Zeku is cool, his just old chill Strider
[3:01:05] <leith_aziz> ...
[3:01:05] <gruulmagebeast> CLUTCH
[3:01:06] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[3:01:09] <Applecannon63> I do hope the last Character is a KoF character but if its not Kyo Kusanagi then I think K' would be a better fit
[3:01:10] <LordOfThePoultry> ...
[3:01:14] <%Deft_Thought> Gotta stance switch for that shoryu!
[3:01:15] <TheArrow_> orb is super good now
[3:01:16] <bigshedman> I love that Zeku is the previous master of an ancient ninja-art. But also goes around trying to get paid.
[3:01:19] <Ardisan_> I love slow moving orbs in fighting games
[3:01:24] <Monkeyweed21> @jinking79 his swap cancels are like 2 frames so its super easy to swap at the start
[3:01:39] <LordOfThePoultry> NotLikeThis
[3:01:40] <%Deft_Thought> Form switching is so much more real for Zeku now.
[3:01:57] <%jinking79> that's fine n all
[3:02:03] <leith_aziz> I gotta give props for SugerPunch for letting me know about Zeku. Damn those animations!
[3:02:06] <%Deft_Thought> I remember feeling really confused when I first picked him up because I assumed he was gonna have Gen combos
[3:02:07] <BlackermanZX> oh that zeku kick is basically Strider's gram
[3:02:13] <gruulmagebeast> ning ning ning
[3:02:14] <FunnyCrimes> @leith_aziz not really playstyle wise makoto's playstyle for the most part is fairly standard strike/throw mixes supported by her insane gap closing ability
[3:02:20] <%Deft_Thought> @BlackermanZX He's the first Strider
[3:02:23] <andre11dr> @applecannon63 If they're going to bring in a KOF caracter bring Iori ,his iconic and has a cool moveset
[3:02:27] <Josef_Stryker> AURORA BOREALIS?
[3:02:34] <+OroOreo> May I see it?
[3:02:34] <DaKnightWarrior> Cammy's theme man SingsNote
[3:02:39] <DaKnightWarrior> so good.
[3:02:54] <Ardisan_> Capcom fighting game cinematic universe but no Capcom All Stars game...
[3:03:00] <BlackermanZX> the concept of zeku being the first strider is so cool
[3:03:04] <Applecannon63> Iori would be great fit but either way my moneys on Kyo Kusanagi or K'
[3:03:04] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:03:05] <Ardisan_> well good one
[3:03:21] <%Deft_Thought> Why are Sakura and Cammy's stage themes so much better than their character themes in 5
[3:03:34] <andre11dr> I hope it's not just Terry again
[3:03:51] <Ardisan_> Kyo > Terry
[3:04:00] <andre11dr> I love Terry but i wanna see someone else at this point
[3:04:03] <Applecannon63> Terry is already in Flexl so its fine
[3:04:04] <BlackermanZX> they should give Zeku a moster hunter rise costume
[3:04:06] <BlackermanZX> like the kamura armor
[3:04:07] <+Vestillion> has capcom - or anyone really, made a statement about makoto? I feel like her exclusion has to have a story.
[3:04:08] <DaKnightWarrior> Watch it just be Terry again.
[3:04:22] <leith_aziz> @Deft_Thought I think it got akward when they had to make 2 seperate versions of the same themse for some characters. For example, Sagat's stage has a better theme than Sagat's actual theme
[3:04:22] <BlackermanZX> Old man Fugen costume for Zeku
[3:04:24] <%Deft_Thought> Nah, its gonna be Mai woolieF
[3:04:33] <Monkeyweed21> @Vestillion at this point they are prolly saving her and dudley for SF6
[3:04:37] <andre11dr> And i yes i do love Kyo ,maybe because he looks like cool Japanese me LUL
[3:04:43] <Ardisan_> I just dont want Terry so im fine with Mai
[3:04:45] <TheArrow_> sometimes popular characters just don't get in
[3:04:46] <%Deft_Thought> Watch them tell everybody to eat shit and put Rugal in this bitch
[3:04:46] <TheArrow_> that's life
[3:05:09] <Ardisan_> Rugal would be the all star choice
[3:05:38] <andre11dr> Watch it be Chang just to troll us
[3:05:45] <%Deft_Thought> Aight, I'm gonna dip on out. Y'all take care and have a good weekend.
[3:05:46] <leith_aziz> @FunnyCrimes: Baiken is a very requested character in many of the Guilty Gea games, but you dont tend to see many actually bother learning her. So I was wondering if Makoto is a character many people want to in the game but arent gonna play her when she does make it
[3:05:48] <bluebeardbby> Battle lounge lets you pick between games
[3:06:02] <%Deft_Thought> Peace out VS crew!
[3:06:09] <Ardisan_> only troll pic is puting the Changs friend that I forgot name of
[3:06:12] <+Jiggisnipe> later
[3:06:13] <leith_aziz> @Deft_Thought: Peace!
[3:06:21] <%CaptainPileDriver> you can have character select
[3:06:28] <FunnyCrimes> @leith_aziz oh yeah she had more than a few ppl who played her at high lvls in 3s
[3:07:07] <leith_aziz> @FunnyCrimes: And casually? Do people play her?
[3:07:14] <FunnyCrimes> i mean i do lmao
[3:07:17] <bluebeardbby> yes
[3:07:21] <+Setos1> How do I get in line?
[3:07:24] <FunnyCrimes> but idk i dont play enough 3s or ultra 4 lmao
[3:07:34] <%ggbhtg> It's no TRIUMPH OR DIE
[3:07:38] <andre11dr> @leith_aziz That's because as cool as she looks, her play style is just kinda lame
[3:07:40] <leith_aziz> I dont mind him
[3:07:48] <Deko_> 4 was kinda hype
[3:07:48] <bluebeardbby> CANT ESCAPE FROM CROSSING FATE
[3:07:57] <%ggbhtg> WHAT'S GONNA HAPPUN NOW?!
[3:08:05] <Ardisan_> Alpha 3 is the best announcer, not one can change my mind
[3:08:06] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Aww shit, Twitter Alexes are here
[3:08:07] <+SignScratch> Prepare to Strike . . . Now
[3:08:08] <leith_aziz> YEAH! THAT MAKES SENSE!
[3:08:11] <Afrosamasenpai> Yo we got more Alex Nation?
[3:08:15] <Afrosamasenpai> [rubs hands]
[3:08:20] <leith_aziz> @Ardisan_ GO FOR IT MAN!
[3:08:20] <%CaptainPileDriver> sf4 was wAAAAY better
[3:08:21] <Applecannon63> 3 was great as hell along with 3rd strikes
[3:08:25] <357Sneak> lytSHADES PrideHeartL yeah, that makes sense
[3:08:31] <Josef_Stryker> How do I search Woolie's lounge?
[3:08:32] <bluebeardbby> Woolie bout ot get twitter clipped
[3:08:44] <DaKnightWarrior> The CVS2 annoncer is so good.
[3:08:45] <leith_aziz> Man, I like Alex, but his pose is so stupid
[3:08:48] <Fluffy_Tamamo> What the fuck is that? ewicaEh
[3:08:54] <bluebeardbby> I like it
[3:08:55] <Applecannon63> SF4 announcer is kinda annoying when you do an ultra combo
[3:09:04] <andre11dr> Yeah his stance just looks wrong
[3:09:06] <BluBox> Blanka'd
[3:09:14] <bluebeardbby> Nothing will ever beat the KI announcer
[3:09:21] <Ardisan_> They tried to do Alex stance in 3D
[3:09:22] <DaKnightWarrior> I would buy that.
[3:09:22] <%ggbhtg> GO FOR BROKE
[3:09:27] <%ggbhtg> dot wav
[3:09:30] <andre11dr> Also im not a fan of his hair
[3:09:35] <leith_aziz> I like those sorta things. Like how GG has every character be an announcer
[3:09:56] <Applecannon63> I honestly like french fries hair Alex
[3:10:10] <EX_shuffle> Announcer packs might be tough because they have to account for future characters
[3:10:10] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1386952720297381894?s=19
[3:10:11] <Saltmeisterr> the fuck is up with alex's legs?
[3:10:13] <andre11dr> He just looks like a random Chad
[3:10:15] <Ardisan_> im good chiefs, you can have that hair
[3:10:19] <leith_aziz> Alex's hair could work, but the game's artstyle is what lets it down
[3:10:21] <+MoroseLoki> mmmm French Fries üçü üòã üòç
[3:10:24] <Goblinade> they're backwards @Saltmeisterr
[3:10:31] <Afrosamasenpai> His legs are fiiiiiiiiiiiiine
[3:10:33] <andre11dr> Before he actually looked like a cool wrestler
[3:11:00] <+Dova573> ggs
[3:11:02] <Ardisan_> They tried to do Alex 3s legs in 3d, which doesnt work.
[3:11:28] <bluebeardbby> It's not potatoface ken at least
[3:11:31] <Josef_Stryker> I can't find the lounge anywhere
[3:11:34] <leith_aziz> @Ardisan_ Were they also backward in 3S? I dont remember them being as obvious
[3:11:41] <Applecannon63> Alex's hair makes him look like that limited edition dragon ball z french fry menu
[3:11:44] <%ggbhtg> just do it again :)
[3:11:59] <Brandon__Brando> wait what hes in this game
[3:12:05] <leith_aziz> Eyy. Hobo Ryu
[3:12:15] <Applecannon63> OLD HOT RYU
[3:12:15] <Ardisan_> @leith_aziz Its not obv because its easier to have exaggerated proportions look and move well in 2d
[3:12:29] <leith_aziz> This is best Ryu
[3:12:33] <+MoroseLoki> Wasn't Hobo Ryu just Ryu?
[3:12:37] <Applecannon63> horny on main
[3:12:49] <Josef_Stryker> What are the settings to find Woolie's Lounge?
[3:12:50] <%jinking79> doesn't championship edition unlock everything before 2020 tourny?

[3:13:46] <leith_aziz> @Ardisan_: Well, the exagerated elements can work in 3D, you just have to be more creative (look at GG artstyle)
[3:13:52] <DaKnightWarrior> Laura's theme is so good.
[3:14:00] <Applecannon63> I wish they could've give Laura some shoto moves liker her brother
[3:14:07] <Ardisan_> @leith_aziz Yeah Arc sys found the tech
[3:14:14] <+StrawberryPantsu> Thats a grab though
[3:14:15] <%ggbhtg> we take those???

[3:15:53] <bluebeardbby> it's like hey, you want Q?

[3:16:26] <Josef_Stryker> Why can't I find Woolie's Battle Lounge?
[3:16:36] <Josef_Stryker> Does it disappear as soon as someone joins?
[3:16:38] <%Zero_Jacks> wait are we woolieGLORY ?
[3:16:45] <Ardisan_> i like Q's design and mystery better still
[3:17:08] <bluebeardbby> He has a Q skin so
[3:17:16] <Ardisan_> jacket short
[3:17:16] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:17:22] <DaKnightWarrior> @ardisan_ me too.
[3:17:22] <Ardisan_> coat I mean
[3:17:23] <primaryfire> the q skin isn't as good as the 3s design tho
[3:17:26] <%Irridium> damn GG LUL
[3:17:28] <bluebeardbby> tru
[3:17:33] <%ggbhtg> Remember how they had a stage actor for G BEFORE anyone knew what he was about? Everybody would've been so hype had they waited.
[3:17:33] <bigshedman> That was DIRTY Woolz LUL
[3:17:35] <leith_aziz> @Ardisan_: It could have been just reusing Q's assets when making G, but I feel that they're suppoused to be the same character considering SFV is a prequel to 3S
[3:17:36] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Woolie is learning
[3:17:47] <andre11dr> I think his such a weirdo that he makes up for Qs mystery
[3:17:49] <primaryfire> G's animations are really stylish, big fan
[3:17:50] <%keiji_maede> Wow
[3:17:54] <%Irridium> I forgot they added that dodge LUL
[3:17:56] <%jinking79> woolieYE
[3:18:05] <%ggbhtg> forgot about V-Shift LUL
[3:18:07] <FunnyCrimes> @leith_aziz my theory is that Q is an Illuminati clone of G
[3:18:11] <%CaptainPileDriver> damnit
[3:18:14] <Darren716> LUL
[3:18:15] <Rawklobstah88> gg @irridium

[3:18:32] <Fist_Wizard_Jay> G is my fuckin favorite for this game
[3:18:35] <Darren716> I thought it meant to do coke?
[3:18:41] <leith_aziz> G and Zeku's animations are why NRS not having passable animations is acceptable.
[3:18:41] <dekkis77> Ed's theme goes hard tho
[3:18:42] <bigshedman> Well, guess I can't play Ky anymore...
[3:18:52] <Brandon__Brando> But you can ride the lighting on a bike

[3:19:30] <FunnyCrimes> @CaptainPileDriver thats the plan tho
[3:19:34] <leith_aziz> Oh, I guess Menat is the Baiken of this game
[3:19:38] <Goblinade> but she has feet
