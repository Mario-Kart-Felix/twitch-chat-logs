[0:17:55] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YALL BETTER BE HEADBANGING
[0:17:57] <ihateyouo> Bugged
[0:17:58] <xxHungryxx> Camping demon
[0:17:59] <Solidnick18> demon may have glitched
[0:18:00] <1matheuw> demon must have entered the floor
[0:18:00] <%BallerSwagBro9k> SourPls
[0:18:02] <%Javaa01> Just fire a BFG straight up
[0:18:02] <dukenux> glitch?

[0:18:04] <ATentacleMonster> SourPls
[0:18:04] <whazat> reset the room
[0:18:05] <+chiluzza> demon hiding
[0:18:06] <DrkJP520> Try shooting the BFG from one end of the room to the other end to get the last demon. Otherwise it's glitched. Again.
[0:18:07] <Griffin1171> Just shoot the BFG up
[0:18:07] <Haarute> music playing means demon.
[0:18:08] <%Irridium> I think you can still go forward?

[0:18:27] <+abrupt_abe> Demon through ground or Imp somewhere on wall
[0:18:27] <isolex_> COWARD
[0:18:27] <%GeneralSCPatton> Siphon grenade might do it
[0:18:28] <Solidnick18> He is immortal

[0:18:30] <+Aeoneth> Ultimate Hell-tech
[0:18:30] <VJdarkworld> id just look around
[0:18:31] <1matheuw> it must be a lost soul
[0:18:32] <awalr> psa1guy
[0:18:34] <GarbageNirvana> The only place you can hide from Doomguy is outside reality
[0:18:34] <@Squdnate> @WoolieVersus It's probably bugged. This map does that at times
[0:18:36] <+YabbaTroll> look under the grate lol
[0:18:36] <Zayasu> i hate it when this happens :(
[0:18:37] <siamzero94> if he can't find me he can't rip & tear me
[0:18:37] <whazat> this level also has a terrible bug with the next room that can actually fuck up the entire level and force you to restart
[0:18:38] <Griffin1171> Throw grenades
[0:18:38] <1matheuw> got stuck in the nothing
[0:18:40] <Drchandragupta> I had the same thing happen on this level
[0:18:41] <goose_attack_almanac> Bethesda Bugs more powerful than the Doom Slayer
[0:18:43] <FirewallStorm> your bugged
[0:18:44] <Vyneci> I think if he fell he might've been shooting at you
[0:18:45] <+Mkingston> It's the president of Blizzard hiding away
[0:18:45] <buerdo> Dont think there is a demon
[0:18:45] <+Neoepochx> Bethesda quality
[0:18:45] <dukenux> fuck
[0:18:45] <%Javaa01> BFGing can work
[0:18:49] <ralphfromdk> Damn you no-clip :o
[0:18:50] <stranger59> He's under the covers, so Doomslayer can't see him.
[0:18:51] <Haarute> shoot a bfg across the room and see wha happan
[0:18:52] <%SilverInferno3> If you shoot the BFG right down the middle maaaybe
[0:18:53] <%CaptainPileDriver> lol, he fell through the earth
[0:18:55] <FirewallStorm> restart
[0:18:57] <DrkJP520> Shoot the BFG up in the air just to make sure
[0:19:04] <%CaptainPileDriver> you gotta restart this room
[0:19:05] <+YabbaTroll> long distance
[0:19:08] <DrkJP520> BFG across the room
[0:19:08] <Hawkbone_> I've played this game like 15 times and have never encountered this before.

[0:19:22] <%SilverInferno3> TODD
[0:19:23] <whazat> PS4 seems like the buggiest version
[0:19:23] <%Irridium> you might still be able to go forward
[0:19:24] <%SilverInferno3> ZENIMAX
[0:19:25] <%CaptainPileDriver> this room
[0:19:26] <+BNPhone> I've never had this happen to me LUL
[0:19:28] <%Javaa01> If the BFG can't find it
[0:19:28] <Griffin1171> Just shoot rockets forever
[0:19:34] <+YabbaTroll> it is a bethesda game after all
[0:19:35] <%Ashenik1> Never happened to me after 5 playthroughs
[0:19:35] <%DensityD> I blame Satan for OBS and for this floor shenanigans
[0:19:36] <+NotHereToStream> bruh
[0:19:39] <niddron> this happens to me too
[0:19:40] <Hawkbone_> Woolie is a damn glitch magnet
[0:19:42] <%SilverInferno3> SATAN

[0:19:44] <+Neoepochx> A force field opens up
[0:19:44] <+rednecked__crake> oh, this bit is bugged
[0:19:45] <%Javaa01> This fight is supposed to end and let you through
[0:19:45] <Dio_TR> BUGTHESDA
[0:19:46] <%Irridium> there's a green vent you can go through up top
[0:19:47] <whazat> after this room is the next area, so yes it's not working correctly
[0:19:47] <Haarute> the QA curse
[0:19:49] <%gatorafan> you should have bought Skyrim.
[0:19:51] <KillMyPast> Glitch magnet Woolie
[0:19:51] <%DensityD> down with the devil-ness
[0:19:53] <+Chimerapractor> Everything in the room turns blue if all enemies are dead.
[0:19:54] <isolex_> Satan was mad at you for saying he got cucked
[0:19:55] <Abok6> hmmm I've never had such a bug
[0:19:56] <+linearlinera> SATAN HEARD YOU
[0:19:58] <%Irridium> all I got
[0:19:59] <+rednecked__crake> Exact same thing happened to me, an enemy is just stuck in a wall
[0:20:01] <BlackermanZX> damn you Satan

[0:20:03] <Vyneci> BibleThump
[0:20:03] <%Ashenik1> Satan tries every trick
[0:20:04] <Hawkbone_> On the upside, you get to do it again!
[0:20:06] <+NotHereToStream> LUL satan
[0:20:08] <CoffeeSlice> GDI SATAN
[0:20:10] <Haarute> we're fighting satan on a meta level
[0:20:10] <%Javaa01> The console ports of this game are a LOT more unstable then PC
[0:20:10] <+Mkingston> camper
[0:20:10] <Vyneci> #BlameSatan
[0:20:12] <%CaptainPileDriver> DAMNIT SATAN
[0:20:12] <JetpackMcQuack> YOU DIDN'T WIN
[0:20:13] <Solidnick18> Satan why must you do this
[0:20:14] <ShinChris> sometimes you can get lucky and hear them at least
[0:20:16] <DrkJP520> Really unlucky to have that happen twice in a playthrough
[0:20:17] <%realm_forge> THE DEVIL IS PULLIN SOME TRICKS
[0:20:17] <+Isaac_nilo_> man, does woolie need to be looking at the ground every time ?
[0:20:17] <1matheuw> see thats what plying them devil games get you

[0:20:21] <+Ryu_R> Did you know that Todd backwards is Satan?
[0:20:23] <+saltytyrz> He heard you chatting shit
[0:20:24] <valriot> @woolieversus This happens to me, it's usually one stray demon just getting lost and clipping through the geometry

[0:20:34] <%gatorafan> Satan curses are pretty cowardly
[0:20:37] <%realm_forge> HE KNOWS YOURE GETTING CLOSE
[0:20:42] <+kraajkase> played this game like 5 time and this happened to me only once, Woolie sure is unlucky
[0:20:46] <%realm_forge> HE‚ÄôS SCARED

[0:30:36] <+einherjarvalk> the shockwave does the killing
[0:30:52] <%SilverInferno3> Yeah the BFG is best thought of as a little drone of DEATH, just don't let it collide with anything

[0:43:21] <Halospaz117> To be fair, if any gun in this game could kill 25, it'd be the BFG

[0:43:55] <awalr> nuts.wad
[0:44:08] <whazat> unfortunately this game never has 25 demons in a room at the same time, probably due to AI limitations

[0:54:45] <Lancaster_H> New For Honor faction, DOOM SLAYERS
[0:54:46] <dukenux> They had to style a bit on demons before shooting them
[0:54:52] <JetpackMcQuack> Put the next Doom during the crusades

[0:54:57] <ihateyouo> They Had Mechs
[0:54:58] <%Ashenik1> nice try satan
[0:55:07] <+Neoepochx> Not gonna spoil anything, but reading a leakes copy of the artbook...Eternal is going to be WILD
[0:55:11] <ThatGuyThere03> Imagine the end of Eternal just ties it into Doom 3
[0:55:13] <ll_aja_ll> Game too sick
[0:55:15] <%realm_forge> HIT SKULL SWITCH FIR LEVER
[0:55:16] <HelghastTroop> anyone here remeber hoe in that romeo+juilet movie they named their guns swords

[0:55:33] <BioApple> this is an alternate path in

[0:55:53] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[0:55:56] <sleepy_pixels> this was an alternative entrance
[0:55:59] <@Solidus_113> voice crack
[0:56:03] <presque> I swear people are talking about Doom Eternal like the game is already out. Is there anything they haven't showed ?
[0:56:04] <BlackermanZX> Kill HIM monkaS
[0:56:05] <HelghastTroop> @isolex_ yea he says long sword and he reaches for a 12 gauge XD
[0:56:10] <+NotHereToStream> can you fucking not!?!
[0:56:14] <Reizie_Etherealm> C E A S E
[0:56:16] <%realm_forge> HIT SKULL SWITCH FOR LEVER
[0:56:16] <%GeneralSCPatton> Can you at least build a body wall?
[0:56:20] <%linSP> doom eternal is a remake of doom 2
[0:56:22] <dukenux> Doomguy killed a legion of demons with a pencil once
[0:56:33] <Maids4lyfe> the skeletons
[0:56:35] <+Neoepochx> @presque a ton left
[0:56:36] <Hawkbone_> @presque There's a lot they haven't shown, Eternal is gonna be a MEATY game
[0:56:36] <Reizie_Etherealm> "What form of power is this?"
[0:56:41] <isolex_> Doomguy is the ultimate christian hero
[0:56:49] <saiyanblitz> Hello Mr Doomslayer can we talk about our feelings before you rip my spine out of my body
[0:56:58] <dukenux> "Belzebub, send in everyone."
[0:57:07] <ThatGuyThere03> everyone?
[0:57:11] <random_moo> ‚ÄúEVERYONE!‚Äù
[0:57:13] <@Solidus_113> "how many do you have"
[0:57:16] <%Javaa01> I mean, you not getting freed was plan A, they're on like plan D by now
[0:57:31] <random_moo> @javaa01 Plan Doom?
[0:57:32] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:57:35] <SheefEatsBeef> controller with that challenge is pain
[0:57:36] <peachy996> He doubled back and ran away
[0:57:38] <Lancaster_H> Woolie vs Controller Aim
[0:58:07] <@Solidus_113> you can try the stun bomb and quickly sw-
[0:58:08] <+linearlinera> stun bomb or hologram would probably help
[0:58:09] <@Solidus_113> yeah
[0:58:13] <BioApple> headshot strat is just to kite them until they're the last thing in the area and then stagger
[0:58:29] <%SilverInferno3> Siege mode will always be better anyways
[0:58:29] <%Ashenik1> SATAN WON :<
[0:58:30] <DrkJP520> Let the BFG round travel for as long as possible so that it can melt more enemies. From one end of the arena to the other is a good strat.
[0:58:31] <1matheuw> big ass shoulders
[0:58:36] <+abrupt_abe> Plasma stun to headshot super easy
[0:58:39] <sleepy_pixels> Satan has blessed them with tiny heads
[0:58:41] <+BNPhone> Jesus take the stickas
[0:58:41] <+Mkingston> mouse ftw
[0:58:46] <Maids4lyfe> does the headshots have to be with the gauss?
[0:58:51] <Hawkbone_> Yes
[0:58:54] <DocMadfox> @Javaa01 "Plan A is the Doom Slayer stays asleep. Oh he's awake. Plan B is kill him. Is he dead? Fuck. Plan C is don't let him get to to Hel.. WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU MEAN HE'S IN HELL!? Plan D, don't let him wake them!"
[0:58:56] <%SilverInferno3> Oof bad shot
[0:58:57] <peachy996> You want them to run straight at you
[0:59:00] <random_moo> ‚ÄúJust click heads‚Äù 4Head
[0:59:02] <%Irridium> gotta fire the bfg so it won't explode instantly
[0:59:03] <@Solidus_113> SourPls
[0:59:12] <dukenux> SourPls
[0:59:13] <%CaptainPileDriver> again, why does that sniper squeak
[0:59:20] <%CaptainPileDriver> like a rubber duck
[0:59:22] <%Javaa01> Pretty much
[0:59:25] <Solidnick18> Kreygasm
[0:59:26] <SheefEatsBeef> AngelThump
[0:59:27] <Zooperton> AngelThump
[0:59:29] <Vyneci> Alright playtime's over
[0:59:36] <Solidnick18> AngelThump
[1:00:20] <peachy996> YEAH
[1:00:25] <peachy996> There it is
[1:00:40] <venomfury86> using seek and destroy with berserk is the best
[1:00:40] <random_moo> Now that‚Äôs what i call Music to kill Demons to | 666
[1:01:04] <peachy996> Its even better with Faster Glory Kills and Further Away
[1:01:10] <%SilverInferno3> @venomfury86 Literally Raging Demon
[1:01:20] <dukenux> Man Gas
[1:01:25] <SheefEatsBeef> how many rounds per second is the chaingun turret
[1:01:25] <Hawkbone_> I wish the chaingun could hold like, 10,000 ammo and it just fucking DRAINS that ammo at like 1,000 bullets a second
[1:01:26] <FutaSnek> Kreygasm
[1:01:29] <%SilverInferno3> MESSATSU
[1:01:41] <FutaSnek> SHOSH
[1:01:49] <venomfury86> Weskering it
[1:02:01] <FutaSnek> Teleporting? Kappa
[1:02:08] <BioApple> it costs $400,000 to fire the chaingun... for twelve seconds
[1:02:13] <Vyneci> AND THEY DON'T STOP COMING
[1:02:20] <dukenux> with one shot
[1:02:21] <%SilverInferno3> Yknow you pretty much are with SnD 2
[1:02:22] <%Irridium> BFG would be best for that but... yeah
[1:02:23] <dukenux> BFG them
[1:02:37] <joniroquai> Doesn't count
[1:02:40] <%SilverInferno3> SIEGE MODE
[1:02:43] <joniroquai> atleast it didn't
[1:03:04] <joniroquai> the arcs from the BFG are apparently classed as seperate shots
[1:03:17] <%GeneralSCPatton> HEAT BLAST
[1:03:20] <DrkJP520> Let the BFG round travel for as long as possible so that it can melt more enemies. From one end of the arena to the other is a good strat.
[1:03:22] <%Javaa01> You have almost 30 points, you can upgrade basically everything
[1:03:24] <SheefEatsBeef> shoutouts to when BFGs used plasma gun ammo
[1:03:26] <Vyneci> Heat blast?
[1:03:27] <%Irridium> if you get them close together and hit them with the main bfg orb it counts
[1:03:28] <%GinAndRoses> just dump em
[1:03:35] <Doomed_SpaceMarine> That track is sign of evil baby
[1:03:40] <%Irridium> that's how I got it
[1:03:42] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[1:03:46] <+DesertPenguin> YOu have more than enough for everything
[1:03:47] <Doomed_SpaceMarine> it's one of the most atmospheric tracks from the original Doom
[1:03:48] <Vyneci> That's everything
[1:03:59] <peachy996> Ez
[1:04:07] <+DesertPenguin> Has he used the holograms or siphon grenades at all? Honestly, they're quite useful
[1:04:13] <%SilverInferno3> He has
[1:04:16] <%tearfuldevil> sometimes
[1:04:21] <%SilverInferno3> Not a whole lot but he has
[1:04:26] <Hawkbone_> He mostly uses siphon
[1:04:32] <%Irridium> it's two for the price of one
[1:04:32] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:04:35] <%GeneralSCPatton> 2 BOOMS
[1:04:36] <Louie_Salmon> Well, once
[1:04:41] <%Irridium> detonate it right before it hits and 2 booms
[1:05:09] <+DesertPenguin> Siphon Grenade is the shit when you also upgrade the Equipment Rune
[1:05:17] <+DesertPenguin> Also works like a stun
[1:05:17] <SheefEatsBeef> big fountains
[1:05:23] <@Solidus_113> it only unlocks after you beat the enemies
[1:05:30] <%Javaa01> The staircase opens up once you finish the fight
[1:05:36] <+DesertPenguin> Eldritch shit right here
[1:05:40] <ihateyouo> HMMMMMMM
[1:05:42] <%SilverInferno3> Shhhhh
[1:05:43] <Hawkbone_> Shhhh
[1:05:43] <Vyneci> Over there bro
[1:05:44] <Louie_Salmon> YOU SURE DO
[1:05:45] <Doomed_SpaceMarine> YEAH THAT WOULD BE SICK
[1:05:47] <THELava_lad> read lore
[1:05:47] <%Ashenik1> HMMMMM
[1:05:48] <+green715> :)
[1:05:48] <BlackermanZX> ThNKS BRAH
[1:05:48] <DocMadfox> NO ONE TELL HIM
[1:05:54] <Hawkbone_> SHHHHH
[1:05:55] <SheefEatsBeef> nahhhhh wdym
[1:05:55] <+DesertPenguin> no one
[1:05:55] <The_Stryking_Warlock> I thought I was going to see woolie play the original doom
[1:05:59] <+DesertPenguin> shhhh
[1:06:03] <@Solidus_113> all of you saying this already spoils it
[1:06:07] <+Davojam> Shhhh
[1:06:07] <@Solidus_113> just don't talk at all
[1:06:08] <dukenux> ffs twitch died on me
[1:06:09] <+Mkingston> @The_Stryking_Warlock I wish
[1:06:10] <joniroquai> Actually that begs the question, what does Woolie know of Eternal?
[1:06:12] <%Javaa01> Except for that one in VEGA Central, that one got left behind
[1:06:12] <+Neoepochx> We need to watch the Eternal trailers after this
[1:06:16] <Solidnick18> Exactly solidus
[1:06:17] <The_Stryking_Warlock> would woolie even consider the original doom?
[1:06:21] <zekana> thnx whoolie, i now know from garfield what hp lovecraft named his cat.
[1:06:22] <DrkJP520> Kramer!
[1:06:27] <%MrMoonGoose> This isn't Super Pixel Racers....
[1:06:29] <+Mkingston> or Brutal Doom
[1:06:33] <peachy996> I am watching as little Eternal as I can
[1:06:34] <DocMadfox> Then senpais never notice us, it's fine
[1:06:36] <%Irridium> or H Doom
[1:06:36] <+mighty_max_t> We have CosmoGuy, what about WandaGuy?
[1:06:43] <@Squdnate> Brutal Doom would not be a good introduction to the OG
[1:06:53] <DrkJP520> KramerGuy
[1:06:53] <peachy996> I already spoiled myself on monsters but everything needs to be fresh
[1:07:01] <The_Stryking_Warlock> BD is good, not a good intro
[1:07:02] <shimapanhero> I kinda want to see him play Doom 3, and not the BFG edition to see how he handles the ADVANCED DARKNESS.
[1:07:02] <Hawkbone_> Brutal Doom is like, the best version of the OG DOOM
[1:07:03] <venomfury86> i saw already too much about Eternal
[1:07:06] <The_Stryking_Warlock> Doom 2 spoiled me
[1:07:15] <+Neoepochx> Brootal Dewm changes the experience way too much
[1:07:23] <shimapanhero> ^
[1:07:30] <%GeneralSCPatton> @shimapanhero BUT VR THO
[1:07:35] <The_Stryking_Warlock> zdoom is alright for it
[1:07:39] <Solidnick18> i hear it
[1:07:43] <The_Stryking_Warlock> modernizes just enough
[1:07:45] <Hawkbone_> Honestly Brutal Doom is closer to the this game than the OG IMO
[1:07:46] <unit24> the virgin brutal doom vs the chad project brutality
[1:07:48] <venomfury86> March is going to be a long month
[1:07:49] <MayorRev> brutal doom is fun but wayyyyyy too modernized
[1:07:52] <%Irridium> check the door
[1:07:53] <+Davojam> Doom 3 sucks
[1:07:53] <MayorRev> he should play classic
[1:07:56] <%Irridium> that opened it I think
[1:07:57] <@Squdnate> zdoom is discontinued, there's gzdoom, which is made by the same guys
[1:07:58] <%Javaa01> It opened
[1:07:59] <+Neoepochx> gzdoom's default texture filtering is hideous
[1:08:00] <%Javaa01> Go back
[1:08:06] <SheefEatsBeef> the virgin brutal doom vs the chad hdoom
[1:08:09] <whazat> chocolate doom or bust
[1:08:10] <Hawkbone_> Doom purists are prunes, Brutal Doom is awesome
[1:08:15] <shimapanhero> @GeneralSCPatton I've heard Doom 3 is actually amazing in vr, that would also be cool.
[1:08:17] <%DensityD> de-modernize fun. we should go back to hoop and stick
[1:08:23] <Solidnick18> oh nice
[1:08:24] <@Squdnate> Brutal Doom and HDoom are good to play after OG
[1:08:25] <%CaptainPileDriver> doom and brutal doom are both great
[1:08:26] <+Neoepochx> No one is saying don't play brutal doom
[1:08:29] <%CaptainPileDriver> i love both
[1:08:30] <@Squdnate> and then the most brutal of them all
[1:08:31] <@Squdnate> Plutonia
[1:08:35] <peachy996> But would you play Doom 3 over watching the Doom movie?
[1:08:40] <+Neoepochx> You should play it after playing OG doom
[1:08:42] <%CaptainPileDriver> no
[1:08:43] <+greatgetter> Brutal Doom is aweful
[1:08:44] <The_Stryking_Warlock> on ultraviolence
[1:08:47] <The_Stryking_Warlock> plutonia
[1:08:48] <MayorRev> ay to where my Demonsteele homies at
[1:08:52] <1matheuw> CLEAN
[1:08:55] <Maids4lyfe> Nice
[1:08:56] <SheefEatsBeef> FUCKING JFK'D HIM MY GOD
[1:09:00] <1matheuw> @MayorRev ayo
[1:09:01] <stanlychicken> project msx is cool too
[1:09:03] <%DensityD> woolieYE woolieREGGIEFUL
[1:09:03] <%Ashenik1> it this the lat one?
[1:09:07] <The_Stryking_Warlock> if Civvie 11 is to be believed
[1:09:13] <MayorRev> yeyeyeyeye
[1:09:16] <@Squdnate> "I beat Plutonia with pistol start"
[1:09:17] <1matheuw> im more of a guncaster person myself
[1:09:22] <@Squdnate> Get all them cosplayers
[1:09:36] <+Neoepochx> FreeCivvie11
[1:09:39] <@Solidus_113> stun bombs
[1:09:42] <unit24> woolie should skip doom 1 and 2 and go straight to plutonia
[1:09:45] <SheefEatsBeef> woolie is trying so hard
[1:09:46] <venomfury86> i think that Project Brutality changed Doom too much, for example: reloading
[1:09:47] <@Squdnate> #FreeCivvie11
[1:09:51] <+BNPhone> ganbarre
[1:09:52] <peachy996> Need those FPS reactions
[1:09:55] <Hawkbone_> Woolies first experience with classic doom should definitely be with the Russian Overkill mod
[1:10:01] <The_Stryking_Warlock> Civvie is so good
[1:10:05] <awalr> biggest problem with original doom maps on ports like gzdoom is they don't do the diminished lighting right, so dark rooms are a fuck
[1:10:05] <MayorRev> who or what is civvie 11
[1:10:07] <ManlyMcBeefington> stasis?
[1:10:09] <Dzikka> FreeCivvie11
[1:10:09] <+Neoepochx> Reloading is terrible in doom 1 and 2
[1:10:11] <The_Stryking_Warlock> just found and watched everything
[1:10:13] <1matheuw> brutal doom also had reloading tho
[1:10:13] <Tuna_Can_0> I like Quake where's Quake 5 :)
[1:10:14] <ihateyouo> BOOMER JUICE
[1:10:20] <%Ashenik1> YEYE

[1:10:28] <+Neoepochx> @mayorrev he reviews boomershooters on youtube
[1:10:31] <Spirit_NB> That knight ran up and said cheese
[1:10:33] <%Ashenik1> music is sooo good
[1:10:35] <SheefEatsBeef> now woolie will never use it
[1:10:36] <+Neoepochx> and he needs to be freed
[1:10:37] <Ner234> The REAL shotgun
[1:10:38] <Hawkbone_> Brutal Doom doesn't have reloading on classic mode
[1:10:38] <%realm_forge> BOOM BABY
[1:10:42] <1matheuw> oh look a walking ammo pack how stranhe
[1:10:45] <joniroquai> Civvie's stuff is pretty good

[1:11:28] <Solidnick18> wow
[1:11:29] <BlackermanZX> LUL
[1:11:29] <@Squdnate> Civvie got me into playing old shooters again, after finding out I missed them. He also introduced me to Dusk
