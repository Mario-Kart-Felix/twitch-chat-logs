[0:04:00] <leith_aziz> Hello
[0:04:10] <Ziegsy> Congrats on successfully becoming a boot
[0:04:16] <narshguy> Hell yeah
[0:04:22] <Applecannon63> I do wish Akira had her V reversal act like a Tardy Counter than having the visual of it
[0:04:31] <Dave_VD> Holy shit this matchup is tight
[0:05:04] <Dave_VD> Beneath the mask over fat john Kreygasm
[0:05:25] <Dave_VD> Oh no this track is force of nature huh
[0:05:57] <leith_aziz> EVO's happening right now. I want to check out the Strive matches, but at that point it'll be almost midnight. Also, this track is mad smooth.
[0:06:13] <%X2Eliah> evo is happening this year?
[0:06:16] <andre11dr> Wait what
[0:06:32] <%Waage83> Evo? really
[0:06:32] <%X2Eliah> and woolie is streaming during evo? LUL what
[0:06:33] <$Superdandy96> Wait?? Evo’s happening?
[0:06:39] <andre11dr> Eh it's just SFV
[0:06:39] <leith_aziz> @X2Eliah It's on Twitch right now. Almost no advertisment for it. Redicillous
[0:06:45] <leith_aziz> Wait, you guys dont know?
[0:06:53] <$Superdandy96> NotLikeThis
[0:06:57] <Applecannon63> its just day 1 evo so meh
[0:06:59] <leith_aziz> Strive's in like 2 hours. It's a mainline game
[0:07:04] <%RealThiele> sony giving EVO the Vita treatment
[0:07:07] <Dave_VD> Aris finna restream tekken top 8 tonight. It'll be like old times
[0:07:07] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:07:08] <Shad0wTag> Thanks Sony I guess for no hype
[0:07:09] <%Waage83> Well i know what i am doing in two hours
[0:07:27] <Applecannon63> FEEL THE POWER BABY
[0:07:32] <+badjab326> Online Evo is lame
[0:07:34] <andre11dr> I genuinely didn't know evo was happening until yesterday
[0:07:38] <420mangojuice> !uptime
[0:07:38] <@Moobot> @420mangojuice WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 7 minutes and 49 seconds
[0:07:51] <leith_aziz> SFV EVO is already on, though it's our side, EU for now only.
[0:07:59] <andre11dr> I feel like nobody is talking about it
[0:08:01] <leith_aziz> @andre11dr Damn.
[0:08:01] <KNYGHT87> so there wasnt a EVO hype video this year??
[0:08:22] <Applecannon63> BACK TO RISE!
[0:08:23] <leith_aziz> @KNYGHT87 What's EVO hype? This is the 1st live EVO I've ever seen in action
[0:08:29] <leith_aziz> BACK TO FLOW
[0:08:31] <Shad0wTag> Anything worth mentioning@leith_aziz
[0:08:53] <+xxAwaken> LeroyPls
[0:09:23] <Applecannon63> Only hoping we see more detail with Luke's gameplay than a teaser in the end of evo
[0:09:27] <andre11dr> The first EVO i saw live was when Justin won Marvel 3 which Wolverine Storm Akuma
[0:09:35] <andre11dr> What was that 2015?
[0:09:40] <leith_aziz> @Shad0wTag Is that a question? Well, MK11 and Skullgirls already happened. SFV right now and Strive after that. It seems to be only EU today. EVO continues tommorow and there's another set 2 weeks later
[0:09:56] <NotHereToStream> man fighting against ino as nago is slightly hellish
[0:10:08] <DedlokPM> teenGOTHS rooBobble pixcatParty bugifRave
[0:10:10] <%Waage83> @leith_aziz What thats stupid
[0:10:13] <%Waage83> 2 weeks
[0:10:17] <ExpressNode> The last EVO I watched was never
[0:10:43] <%RealThiele> 2 weeks gotta let that iron get cold before striking again
[0:10:53] <Shad0wTag> My b I meant if EU side of side of SF5 had anything worth telling?
[0:11:00] <+badjab326> Dude Power Rangers is such a sick game
[0:11:07] <+badjab326> so hype Woolie is playing it again
[0:11:10] <Applecannon63> Not gonna lie Luke's hair is okay just wish he didn't have the star shave cut
[0:11:13] <andre11dr> EVO has lost some of its charm over the years
[0:11:19] <leith_aziz> @Applecannon63 That and I'm expecting another Strive DLC character. If the Samsho thing is true, it could be a double reveal for both games for "I wont say who here". If not, then im just expecting Jack-O, which I wouldnt mind as well
[0:11:23] <andre11dr> It's not grimmie anymore
[0:11:29] <NotHereToStream> I only go watch evo for the trailers tbh
[0:11:30] <%Waage83> @Shad0wTag That might be true, but that is still hurtfull
[0:11:50] <Shad0wTag> I'm hoping for some toku lovw  from Woolie tonight
[0:11:52] <+badjab326> EVO was hype whenever they had Marvel
[0:11:58] <DedlokPM> teenGOTHS rooBobble pixcatParty bugifRave
[0:12:04] <andre11dr> I want see the return of The Ghost of Marvel
[0:12:07] <leith_aziz> @Applecannon63 Ever seen Yakuza? Luke's tattoos are underwhelming in comparison. I think Luke's hairstyle looks bad because it's in SFV's artstyle
[0:12:10] <%Waage83> EVO is still hype, but 2020 and 2021 was wierd
[0:12:36] <Dave_VD> Anyone checked out the new Suicide Squad? I heard it was actually pretty good
[0:12:40] <%Waage83> Fuck i did not even notice the Olympics until they started
[0:12:43] <leith_aziz> I havent watched enough of EVO to judge it, but last year was...something
[0:13:02] <leith_aziz> @Dave_VD Yeah, I heard it was good. Hope taht turns out to be the case
[0:13:04] <andre11dr> Fuck the Olympics
[0:13:06] <leith_aziz> *that
[0:13:09] <Applecannon63> @leith_aziz and what's funny with Luke's tattoo's is that they reuse the unused concept design were Ed had those
[0:13:10] <$Superdandy96> Best EVO for me was the year Geese was announced for Tekken 7
[0:13:22] <andre11dr> PAY THE ATHLETES
[0:13:28] <andre11dr> YOU FUCKS
[0:13:47] <andre11dr> You make ao much money off them
[0:13:50] <Applecannon63> the same wing tattoos
[0:13:53] <@Menitta> Massively hyped for this GIFG
[0:14:05] <n_0x> @Dave_VD yes it's very good and king shark is the best boy
[0:14:06] <@Menitta> Just bought BFTG and its cool
[0:14:15] <Dave_VD> @Menitta Yeah this game is fucking sweet
[0:14:15] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1423196401152974850?s=19
[0:14:24] <leith_aziz> I actually only found out about Guilty Gear from the closed Strive beta, if I saw the EVO reveal trailer, I'd be hyped. Shocking how late I found about my favorite FG series as of now
[0:14:25] <$Superdandy96> How much does Woolie know about that PR lore?
[0:14:39] <Dave_VD> @n_0x Dope, I'm excited to check it out
[0:14:50] <leith_aziz> I remember watching the PR show with the purple Wolf guy
[0:14:54] <%Waage83> @Superdandy96 is there lore?
[0:15:07] <leith_aziz> I remember liking it, but its very unclear memories from long ago
[0:15:09] <DedlokPM> teenGOTHS rooBobble pixcatParty bugifRave
[0:15:18] <alphalejandro> @Superdandy96 He has watch some of the other shows post Mighty Morphin
[0:15:23] <@Menitta> I'm not too into Power Rangers but I fuckin love Ryu and Chun Li's designs in this game
[0:15:24] <%Waage83> @Superdandy96 ohter then fight, OH NO MONSTER BIG, NOW ROBOT FIGHT!!!!
[0:15:29] <$Superdandy96> @waage83 *smokes a cigar* the how much time you got?
[0:15:32] <@Menitta> Like take any character and make them a Power Ranger
[0:15:34] <@Menitta> its sick
[0:15:39] <Applecannon63> honestly Time Force>MMPR
[0:15:42] <andre11dr> Wait you didn't knew about GG until Strive?
[0:15:51] <Shad0wTag> Hes mostly a Kamen Rider fan, Super Sentai and PR aren't an area of expertise but its fine honestly
[0:15:52] <Thunderhog> PARTY TIME
[0:15:52] <andre11dr> I guess that's a lot of people
[0:15:57] <$Superdandy96> Time force is so good, like what the hell.
[0:15:58] <KeiPrime> bomb a head
[0:16:07] <leith_aziz> @andre11dr Yes. Other than the beta, Max's rate the IK's was the first time I saw the game in action, and I was impressed
[0:16:13] <%Waage83> @Superdandy96 About 30 mins
[0:16:17] <$Superdandy96> Light speed was my shit growing up
[0:16:21] <+ghostfaceninja_> doodShake
[0:16:22] <leith_aziz> Once you see it, you instantly fall in love with it
[0:16:22] <iacus_> tbf kamen rider is more conceptually interesting than SS imo
[0:16:29] <andre11dr> Oh God
[0:16:33] <Applecannon63> TIME FIRE
[0:16:39] <iacus_> what's nuts to me is that PR is mostly in a single continuty
[0:16:49] <alphalejandro> I watch until Mystic Force and then i dropped
[0:16:52] <andre11dr> WHAT'S HIS NAME
[0:16:57] <@Menitta> So far I think my team is Chun Li. Pink, and Udonna
[0:16:58] <Shad0wTag> Disney era PR was  honestly based
[0:17:01] <andre11dr> YOU NEVER FIND OUT
[0:17:09] <Kiari13> bigfoot woolie monkaS
[0:17:11] <leith_aziz> I've never seen Kamen Rider, like at all. All I know is that it's big
[0:17:28] <@Menitta> I wish there was one more SF character just so you could do a whole team as SF
[0:17:30] <$Superdandy96> @waage83 30mins? Okay, I’ll tell you the quick version: powers given to people to fight bad guys. Also multiverse
[0:17:33] <Applecannon63> KR is much wild than PR
[0:17:38] <Clamydomonas> guys did you see the stone ocean key visual
[0:17:39] <Shad0wTag> If you like toku its great time
[0:17:39] <Applecannon63> to some degree
[0:17:45] <Dave_VD> Time force is good. In Space is my personal favorite. The ending is full scale battle for all of earth and there is an actual meaningful death
[0:17:47] <Thunderhog> Most rider series are pretty decent. Basicly just live action Shounen anime
[0:17:48] <+trackles_64> isntthis DMCA?
[0:17:54] <%Waage83> All i know about power rangers is that at some point it came out in my country and weall started playing power rangers, but in realty we beat the shit out of one another
[0:17:56] <n_0x> @Menitta i mean bison is in the PR mobile game so fingers crossed
[0:18:02] <leith_aziz> @Applecannon63 I havent seen enough of PR to determine "wild", but thanks anyway
[0:18:08] <Applecannon63> KR has some great choreography
[0:18:17] <ExpressNode> Haven't watched GItS in a while
[0:18:31] <$Superdandy96> I love the costumes for KR. A lot of them a absolute bangers
[0:18:32] <andre11dr> I had the opportunity to spend time getting into Kamen Rides or Gundam
[0:18:37] <+trackles_64> When are they doing season 2 of 2042 Gits?
[0:18:46] <Applecannon63> great choreography when it comes specific finishers
[0:18:47] <andre11dr> In the end i picked Gundam
[0:18:53] <+Rada150> I wonder how long they will keep updating this game
[0:19:03] <andre11dr> I don't know if i made the right decision LUL
[0:19:09] <%Waage83> Yeah how old is this game now?
[0:19:09] <Ziegsy> I thought this was the ghost in the shell lady.
[0:19:13] <%Sparkseid> sajamJam
[0:19:13] <Dave_VD> The full kamen rider x sentai teammup movie is on youtube and it's pretty sweet
[0:19:34] <Aydarkzero> considering it's Power Rangers they could go for a minute considering how many teams there have been
[0:19:34] <+trackles_64> The person singing this  died didnt she?
[0:19:45] <leith_aziz> @Rada150 What more can you see the devs adding? I think the visuals are the biggest thing holding the game back (undertsandable, as the devs only worked on mobile games beforehand, but still)
[0:19:49] <+ghostfaceninja_> I wish they would play another game of Dokapon
[0:19:51] <andre11dr> And i love a lot of Gundam, but there seems to be more bad Gundam series than bad Kamen Rider
[0:19:53] <%Sparkseid> @trackles_64 unfortunately, yes
[0:19:58] <zeekayart> ooooo power rangers
[0:20:05] <Shad0wTag> Its fine choice but premium bandai will have your wallet
[0:20:14] <Applecannon63> tbh the super hero taisen(kamenriderxsupersentai)is so batshit when it comes to story
[0:20:28] <leith_aziz> @Sparkseid May that person RIP
[0:20:35] <Shad0wTag> OHOH we have bad  rider seasons dude
[0:20:43] <zeekayart> i bought this game for PS+ with a friend and then i played it about... three times.......
[0:20:58] <Applecannon63> Hibiki and Ghost were rough…
[0:21:03] <zeekayart> the multiplayer online aspect i mean
[0:21:05] <+Rada150> @leith_aziz there are still alot of characters that have potential but the problem is that the engine will eventually fall behind they could update their tech but they aren't a triple AAA company
[0:21:11] <Dave_VD> @leith_aziz There are several really sick characters that they could add, and they definitely need one or two more megazords. One more season of DLC would be perfect but they've already supported this game way longer than they had to
[0:21:19] <andre11dr> It's can't be as bad as SEED
[0:21:21] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:21:28] <Thunderhog> Hibiki was ok but definitely a differnt kind of show
[0:21:30] <alphalejandro> Gundam ZZ, Seed Destiny and AGE are probably the worst shows  of the Gundam franchise, just avoid them
[0:21:32] <$Superdandy96> Me Ghost was rough, but I was still engaged with Hibiki
[0:21:33] <Thunderhog> Ghost was...ghost...
[0:21:35] <whimsicallifestyle> @Applecannon63 i feel you. hibikis first half was good, but man.....
[0:21:43] <Shad0wTag> yes we have seed equivalent
[0:21:46] <leith_aziz> @Dave_VD I see. Thanks
[0:21:55] <Applecannon63> @thunderhog it got different because of change of director/writer
[0:21:55] <Shad0wTag> hell we have  like 3
[0:22:12] <leith_aziz> @Rada150 What do you mean exactly with they will "fall behind"?
[0:22:13] <+Rada150> I mean the next logical step is working on a sequel but I don't know if they could
[0:22:16] <%elderpunch> CatJAM
[0:22:18] <+trackles_64> The english cast for gits was better than the japanese cast
[0:22:18] <donell324> So who is ready for Kamen Rider Revice?
[0:22:29] <n_0x> @Applecannon63 hibiki's first half was good
[0:22:31] <Shad0wTag> I'm hyped
[0:22:33] <Applecannon63> also heisei era riders were mostly battle royal plot
[0:22:34] <+Rada150> @leith_aziz move to a better graphics engine etc
[0:22:40] <alphalejandro> Oh and Reconquista in G was also pretty bad, avoid that one too
[0:22:54] <andre11dr> Chat go watch Karas
[0:22:58] <Shad0wTag> Toshiki Inoue is a hack writer
[0:22:59] <andre11dr> Just do it
[0:23:02] <%Waage83> No
[0:23:05] <leith_aziz> @andre11dr what's that?
[0:23:05] <%Waage83> Make me
[0:23:06] <whimsicallifestyle> revice looks ok but its fucked up with the va they picked
[0:23:10] <Applecannon63> Revice is still interesting but still yikes because racist jp va
[0:23:12] <+trackles_64> Naruto theme
[0:23:27] <%ggbhtg> ggbhtg subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months, currently on a 5 month streak! Gotta be honest: Learning Tekken at mid-level asks a lot of a you. I detoured to Melee for a couple years, but now I'm just burned out on fighting games. But there's something so innately rad about the raw power of TEAMWORK, that today, I can't stay away.
[0:23:27] <andre11dr> @leith_aziz A great sentai
[0:23:31] <ExpressNode> Oh wow twitch mobile added a pause button
[0:23:42] <andre11dr> It's so dumb but so baddass
[0:23:50] <Applecannon63> Man Digimon Tamer's writer is so oof
[0:23:53] <leith_aziz> @andre11dr ok them what exactly is a "sentai"? Im being genuine, I dont really know
[0:23:54] <Kiari13> okay but when will Woolie stream Final Slam 2 from Newgrounds
[0:23:55] <andre11dr> It's kinda like Revengece in that way
[0:23:57] <leith_aziz> *ok then
[0:23:58] <+Rada150> I mean im sure people would be fine if they kept adding 3 character DLC packs to infinty but the problem is it's not the best buisness model
[0:24:08] <Dave_VD> @leith_aziz Japanese power rangers
[0:24:08] <donell324> Yeah I agree with the va being shit but that isn't going to ruin my enjoyment of the show
[0:24:12] <leith_aziz> @andre11dr Oh, hmmm, maybe then
[0:24:12] <$Superdandy96> So chat, what’s your favorite rider suit?
[0:24:23] <@Menitta> Can I say Chun Li
[0:24:29] <iacus_> @andre11dr It's one of those transforming warriors with the colored suits
[0:24:31] <+ribnal> Kabuto
[0:24:39] <alphalejandro> @Superdandy96 Zero Two
[0:24:41] <leith_aziz> My advice is generally "seperate the art from the artist" when it comes to enjoying things
[0:24:43] <donell324> Rampage Vulcan
[0:24:46] <whimsicallifestyle> im watching kabuto so thebee is really up there right now but chalice is really good too
[0:24:46] <Applecannon63> Zero one/Blade/Build for best suit
[0:24:58] <Shad0wTag> While I feel nothing for KR Saber, I still think Reiwa is doing pretty alright so far
[0:24:59] <+ribnal> Kabuto is the best rider.
[0:25:00] <whoguru5> Build had some banger suits
[0:25:08] <Dave_VD> @leith_aziz All of the actual footage of the power rangers shows with them in their suits is footage cut from the original japanese shows. It's super interesting
[0:25:09] <@Menitta> Damn traffic
[0:25:09] <iacus_> Kabuto is a great series
[0:25:11] <%Waage83> AHAHAHA
[0:25:14] <%elderpunch> reggie stuck in traffic lmaoooo
[0:25:17] <Applecannon63> oh yeah even Double was interesting
[0:25:20] <+Rada150> also I like how the American PR did a cross over with Masked Rider before Japan did any Sentai/Kamen rider cross overs
[0:25:20] <$Superdandy96> Damn, you guys got some good taste
[0:25:23] <%LurkerKraid> woolieKICKDAD
[0:25:24] <Shad0wTag> W rules
[0:25:25] <whimsicallifestyle> kabuto is great because everyone is a weirdo in it
[0:25:27] <iacus_> I tend to prefer the serious/edgy Riders to the goofy comedic ones tbh
[0:25:29] <whoguru5> @iacus_ I'm 32 episodes into it and so far yeah it's good
[0:25:34] <+trackles_64> is that that mario game music?
[0:25:41] <whoguru5> W is still my favourite
[0:25:45] <andre11dr> What's the power rangers with the wizard shit ? I remember watching that as a kid
[0:25:46] <Dave_VD> Yeah please someone PM me with these kamen rider/sentai recommendations
[0:25:51] <leith_aziz> @Dave_VD Isn't it called "Super Sentai or something? Very interesting stuff
[0:25:51] <$Superdandy96> I’m stuck between Faiz’s suit or Kabutos
[0:25:57] <donell324> So chat what was the saddest Kamen Rider moment for you I'll go first it was the death of grease
[0:26:00] <whoguru5> sure it's more episodic than I'd like but I enjoy every character

[0:31:28] <iacus_> awesome
[0:31:28] <@Solidus_113> no more gifg layout FeelsBadMan
[0:31:32] <+ghostfaceninja_> one step closer to a more "stream'y" stream
[0:31:36] <+hypemaster19> tg
[0:31:43] <andre11dr> Someone watched a Max stream i see
[0:32:05] <+Rada150> alot of streamers use that format, Asmongold uses that too
[0:32:07] <%Prevot> if anything this will be great for pop off moments during LPs
[0:32:54] <iacus_> I like that it's a youtube-first joint
[0:32:57] <%agoaj> All fall before the facecam
[0:32:58] <Qu1ckyyy> Are you also recording the camera seperately?
[0:33:15] <%elderpunch> damn no more cool art NotLikeThis
[0:33:28] <+Rada150> they should make a Monster Hunter Fighting game ala Primal Rage
[0:33:29] <+xiccy> ayyy didn't go 0-2 in Skullgirls
[0:33:33] <@Menitta> As someone who watches both, I know I'd prefer a face cam since it's going back and forth between the two
[0:33:37] <whoguru5> Streaming has really changed how lp's are done
[0:33:37] <+eyemarrs> times change SMOrc
[0:33:46] <Shad0wTag> Change Wasp
[0:33:50] <%Sparkseid> the Raidou LP already has some great Reggie reactions
[0:34:02] <andre11dr> I mean one of the best parts of the Disco LP was Twitch exclusive ,that being Woolies spine lose to laughter LUL
[0:34:10] <+Advent_Child04> yo woolie whats good brotha!? 🤘🏿
[0:34:10] <$Superdandy96> ^
[0:34:17] <%mr_sups> Sups
[0:34:20] <Trigon_Trey> i remember hating face cam but now i dont mind
[0:34:21] <whoguru5> Back in my day rooOld it was just 240p recordings from dazzle that people recorded commentary on
[0:34:30] <iacus_> nice wallpapers too
[0:34:38] <$Superdandy96> @andre11dr god that moment was beautiful, not for wools of course LUL
[0:34:49] <Majestic_Flof> its called an addiction since its out faster
[0:34:52] <+Rada150> Back in my day we used FRAPS
[0:35:06] <Mvrdok_> It's always nice to experiment and see what sticks
[0:35:08] <zeekayart> STALL HARDER WOOLIE!
[0:35:08] <%mr_sups> That means we'll just have to put it on in the background
[0:35:09] <@Menitta> Fuck yeah bird rights
[0:35:20] <Shad0wTag> Lets toku while Reggie is away
[0:35:20] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:35:24] <+Vork88> woolie can you check out my sims 4 character i made of you and pat and see if i need to add anything else?
[0:35:30] <ExpressNode> PS2 copy?
[0:35:43] <%Prevot> that sweet HDPS2
[0:35:46] <andre11dr> I did watch Onimusha on YT but that's because i never caught up with the streams
[0:35:53] <+mikehuntis4timmy> @WoolieVersus hey woolie u lookin like a snack today
[0:35:58] <leith_aziz> CHaracters that dont level up?
[0:36:01] <leith_aziz> *characters
[0:36:07] <%ozzrabbit> Stat
[0:36:08] <$Superdandy96> Let’s talk tokusatsu Woolie Kappa
[0:36:10] <%jolene_orenji> they probably meant either having a wide array of skill trees or something or just CACs
[0:36:11] <+ReallyBigRocks> Like you can RP a character?
[0:36:43] <@Menitta> There's so much involved with Tekken
[0:36:58] <%mr_sups> He's a Very bad man
[0:36:59] <+Rada150> i mean some of the combos in Tekken 3 were just one long unending chain
[0:37:05] <Super_Voltekka> Tekken 7 will never have rollback FeelsBadMan
[0:37:16] <leith_aziz> I used to play Tekken 7 untill I reached red ranks. At that point,, there was too muc character specific strings I couldnt keep track of
[0:37:18] <Shad0wTag> We need to get Woolie to watch some more rider. I think the last one he watched was Gaim? (Which is honestly amazing)
[0:37:22] <$Superdandy96> I still can’t do king’s advance grabs BibleThump
[0:37:27] <@Solidus_113> tekken players are just built different
[0:37:40] <%ggbhtg> Oh yeah, I had a tourney thing last week, and I watched that vid as some fundamental reminders. I won said tourney, btw
[0:37:43] <Trigon_Trey> just knowing how to move in tekken takes skill
[0:37:47] <leith_aziz> @Superdandy96 Map a button to all 4 attack buttons then just spam the button
[0:37:52] <+Rada150> I hurt my hands so bad playing Eddie Gordo  in tekken 3
[0:38:04] <+Diabetic> I could literally just spend all day listening to Woolie talking about anything in that smooth as silk voice.
[0:38:04] <%ggbhtg> Even though there's the top 15 - 20 moves, there's always that back pocket YOLO move
[0:38:09] <$Superdandy96> @leith_aziz BRUH, how did I not ever think that
[0:38:11] <@Menitta> I'm learning how to play Lidia and she's so fun
[0:38:18] <@Solidus_113> There's a recent Vtuber who's a tekken player that tried Strive for the first time, and she would constantly get neg penalty for not being aggressive
[0:38:18] <andre11dr> It sucks that Woolie can't go online in Marvel, i want to see those Iron Man infinites on this stream
[0:38:33] <%LordSDB> I grew up playing Tekken, so going into 2d fighters, its fun to abuse people who crouch a lot
[0:38:34] <zeekayart> 2d brain in a 3d world BibleThump
[0:38:37] <leith_aziz> I actually had a hard time getting into SFV. I actually had an easier time learning Rev 2 and Strive
[0:38:44] <donell324> @Shad0wTag Yeah Gaim was the last one Woolie saw
[0:38:56] <+Rada150> @WoolieVersus do you think the Netherrealms Marvel game will be Injustice 3 Marvel vs DC
[0:38:58] <leith_aziz> When I first played SFV, I had no idea what charge attacks were and how they worjed
[0:39:01] <leith_aziz> *worked
[0:39:09] <%jolene_orenji> @solidus_113 GG is such a fun game cuz it actively penalizes you for not running in like a psychopath all the time I love it
[0:39:09] <Thunderhog> @Solidus_113 If you mean rose I saw that. Yeah seeing someone with a tekken only brain adapt to 2d was quite the case study
[0:39:10] <%ggbhtg> I think I had the inverse with Strive, I haven't even touched the game, because my brain was scrambled off Tekken's depth
[0:39:18] <whoguru5> god what show would I recommend post gaim? drive is excellent series  (Riku Sanjo as head writer is always good)
[0:39:19] <zeekayart> knowing which way voldo is gyrating is also very important
[0:39:19] <Shad0wTag> Honesty @donell324 would love Build ans Zero One
[0:39:27] <@Solidus_113> yeah rosemi
[0:39:36] <$Superdandy96> Gaim was the last KR Woolie watched? Man, I’d love to get his reaction to the newer ones besides Ghost
[0:39:43] <donell324> I love both of those @Shad0wTag
[0:40:14] <Shad0wTag> @superdandy96 I don't think Woolie watched all of phase 1 of Heisei
[0:40:15] <@Menitta> Getting MVC2 online in its current state is a nightmare. You gotta get NullDC going along with some other stuff
[0:40:15] <+Rada150> MK Deadly Alliance and Deception followed the Tekken and SC style too which also threw people off
[0:40:22] <andre11dr> Negative Penaltie is kinda wierd, i got used to it but it's such a disadvantage for zoners
[0:40:22] <whoguru5> Was ghost that bad? I kind of skipped it because I was playing catchup with ex aid but never really gotten a real reason as to why
[0:40:36] <%mr_sups> BLACK CHRISTMAS

[0:43:24] <whoguru5> @DedlokPM panda? rooSpy
[0:43:25] <AverageHanzo> Isuka is silly fun if you get other 3 people who know barely anything about fighters
[0:43:29] <+michlarv> What was the first GG you played Wools?
[0:43:30] <+Diabetic> I was in high school when 1 came out, I'm so old lol
[0:43:33] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> he lpayed overture first and he turned out FINE
[0:43:37] <DedlokPM> @whoguru5 No pandas here rooSpy
[0:43:41] <%SirGO0SE> 2 WAS MY FIRST
[0:43:44] <%SirGO0SE> and i LOVED it
[0:43:44] <donell324> @WoolieVersus I didn't like it even though it was my first
[0:43:46] <Shad0wTag> However if someone's favourite Rider season is Ghost be deeply concerned
[0:43:52] <+JmosesX> the first mgs i played was 4. . .
[0:43:53] <andre11dr> NO I'll talk mega shit again Isuka
[0:43:55] <anAngryHamster> Dr. Paradigm for Strive
[0:43:57] <%TubeMan642> 2 was my first and made me hate DMC
[0:44:03] <%jolene_orenji> my first mortal kombat game was MK vs DCU...

[0:44:06] <Super_Voltekka> My first Megaman game was X6 SeriousSloth
[0:44:06] <+desfore> My first GG was 2 on an arcade machine in a pool hall
[0:44:11] <leith_aziz> You know what? That probably happens to a lot of us
[0:44:11] <Applecannon63> Honestly Ghost is funny just plot wisebis rough
[0:44:12] <%Sparkseid> gotta start somewhere
[0:44:13] <whoguru5> @WoolieVersus also if you play the worst first it's like the good times keep on coming
[0:44:15] <@Menitta> My first Street Fighter AND TEKKEN game was SFXT
[0:44:15] <dds333a> @jolene_orenji what the fuck
[0:44:16] <%DkLordG> My first game was Capcom Fighting Evolution, but I know better now lol
[0:44:18] <andre11dr> I big shame Overture

[0:45:29] <%Sparkseid> LUL
[0:45:33] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[0:45:35] <leith_aziz> @Applecannon63 Hell, Overture is probably one of the most important games in the series storywise
[0:45:37] <%chuckfinley22> i snagged the isuka :^)
[0:45:38] <%Sparkseid> bruh
[0:45:40] <dds333a> completely different
[0:45:40] <leith_aziz> Which game?
[0:45:43] <%mr_sups> Zelda/Halo Cycle
[0:45:48] <dds333a> Rev was lambasted
[0:45:49] <alphalejandro> Where i live is winter...it looks foogy an çd gloomy as $hit
[0:45:49] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> hmmmmmmm Kappa
[0:45:49] <%jolene_orenji> THE ONLY GOOD GUILTY GEAR IS THE PACHISLOT
[0:45:51] <@Menitta> Old hotness

[0:45:57] <whoguru5> The doctor who cycle rooKek
[0:46:03] <+Jiggisnipe> FGC never change Kappa
[0:46:04] <Nocturnment> how it always be
[0:46:08] <%mr_sups> Not just fighting games. GAMES THEMSELVES
[0:46:08] <dds333a> and then Rev2 was praised, a bit
[0:46:11] <%Waage83> Well we all know Strive is the worst GG ever
[0:46:13] <andre11dr> It would be if it had good online
[0:46:21] <@Solidus_113> SF6 gonna be wild
[0:46:21] <%Sparkseid> The cycle is always fascinating
[0:46:23] <$Superdandy96> woolieGASM_HF woolieKICKDAD_SG
[0:46:28] <alphalejandro> @Waage83 Worst than Isuka?!
[0:46:30] <+Diabetic> I can't believe the turn on Strive honestly
[0:46:32] <+Jiggisnipe> SF4 was a baby game right Kappa
[0:46:32] <andre11dr> Well at least Xrd didn't take moves away
[0:46:34] <%BeautifulDuwang4> BeautifulDuwang4 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! Love to see SMT on the channel,Be safe guise
[0:46:34] <Shad0wTag> Was W your first Rider season or was it Kabuto?
[0:46:36] <+michlarv> Is Strive a good place to start for someone who's barely touched the series? Single player/story included
[0:46:36] <+ribnal> GGX players did a lot of pushback against GGXX back in the day
[0:46:42] <%ChoculaUltra> SF6 is guaranteed to be divisive
[0:46:45] <dds333a> And people will always say I remember when we hated this thing
[0:46:46] <%ggbhtg> Some would call that copium, I would call that rude
[0:46:50] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yeah, nothing will top Overture tbh, peak of guilty gear right there
[0:46:52] <leith_aziz> You can still find old forums of people who hated SF4 at launch. Same for SF3, same for Tekken 7, same for Xrd, same for Strive, etc
[0:46:53] <whoguru5> Shit remember when wind waker was considered bad? LUL
[0:46:54] <@Menitta> I swear if people go "man SFV was great, way better than SF6" I'm gonna lose my shit
[0:47:09] <+UberWolfman> Remember when Hyper Fighters hated Turbo and Turbo fans hated alpha and etc etc etc.
[0:47:12] <%mr_sups> I remember I heard someone say Brawl was better smash 4 and Ultimate. AND I TOOK A SHIT!
[0:47:14] <$Superdandy96> @menitta you know it’s gonna happen
[0:47:19] <@Menitta> NotLikeThis
[0:47:19] <iacus_> My introduction to Kamen Rider was one of the W movies, the one with Genki Sudo, which is a weird entry point I guess
[0:47:21] <andre11dr> @menitta Well that will not be me
[0:47:22] <Majestic_Flof> Very Uunga
[0:47:26] <%ggbhtg> @Menitta It's gonna happen. THE WHEEL OF FATE IS TURNING

[0:47:43] <donell324> @Shad0wTag my first Kamen Rider was Ex-Aid then I stopped and started with Kuuga
[0:47:43] <+ribnal> Big DAMAGE!
[0:47:49] <dds333a> Great game.
[0:47:49] <%ggbhtg> Thank Shin Megami Tensei, Nocturne!

[0:48:23] <%ggbhtg> G4 had some banger skits
[0:48:25] <leith_aziz> @michlarv For story, watch Woolie's lore series videos on Youtube then get into Strive. It'll cover everything beforehand and you'll have a much better understanding. For gameplay, I think this is the best place to start. Singleplayer contenmt at the moment is kinda lacking at the moment. Luckily the online is great

[1:11:31] <abbock> Clockwork isn't at nWay anymore though.
[1:11:37] <+Basilias_Maximus> It's on Gamepass.
[1:11:38] <abbock> The game in its current state is kinda sorta the ShadyK show
[1:11:38] <+MidnightDeacon> This game is so sick
[1:11:41] <mephium> oh FeelsBadMan
[1:11:45] <%Afterman_> god power rangers, as a series, has been fuckign GODLY lately
[1:11:52] <andre11dr> Woolie will probably just play Vergil
[1:12:06] <%ggbhtg> Ain't no more Saban, btw. HASBRO bought the whole franchise a couple years ago. ALL OF IT.
[1:12:09] <$Superdandy96> Which one, dog Vergil or Gunner Vergil Kappa
[1:12:10] <whoguru5> is beast morphers really that good? or are we just talking comics
[1:12:12] <Shad0wTag> Why can't Toei just get someone to make a Kamen Rider fighting game. I'll take a platform fighter at this point
[1:12:13] <@Menitta> I can see myself dropping this game but I really dig how this game is an easy to pick up Marvel game
[1:12:14] <poor_ppl> vergil's good
[1:12:16] <mephium> I need mre quantum power
[1:12:18] <%Afterman_> @whoguru5  comics. idk about show
[1:12:23] <mephium> more*
[1:12:28] <@Menitta> Like Marvel is a brick wall in terms of getting into it
[1:12:32] <Applecannon63> @shad0wtag cause Toei is strict
[1:12:33] <andre11dr> The one literally voiced by Virgil
[1:12:45] <Kriss1827> @menitta its fun to come back to it every now and then
[1:12:47] <+MyHandsAreBlank> Play Magna Defender I beg of you
[1:12:49] <Shad0wTag> @whoguru5 Beast Morphers is pretty decent. I do prefer Go Busters though
[1:12:51] <%Afterman_> @whoguru5  if you havent read it I HIGHLY recommend it. feel free to pm me for some links
[1:12:54] <Thunderhog> lytMOTIVATED

[1:13:08] <$Superdandy96> That and I’m pretty sure there was like, 3 attempts at making Kamen Rider and thing in the west
[1:13:09] <@Menitta> Ryu and Chun Li look so fucking good in this game
[1:13:10] <mephium> no way oddonePOG

[1:13:19] <iacus_> of course, starting with  a non-transformed non-ranger lol
[1:13:26] <+the22cstomp> RJ is really cool
[1:13:29] <drefizz> Dan
[1:13:31] <%Afterman_> @andre11dr  dan southworth. he was actually the actor in the show too for time forcve
[1:13:32] <+pupil31> Is Ryu from Fortnite POGGERS
[1:13:34] <Kiari13> Scorpina looks poggers
[1:13:41] <dds333a> well of course
[1:13:45] <Shad0wTag> @applecannon63 You say that but we got a OOO's,W and Zero One game last year and it got an Asian English translation
[1:13:45] <@Menitta> Who does Vergil voice?
[1:13:52] <abbock> The lore button has always been there
[1:13:53] <artificiallynatural> eric meyers
[1:13:53] <Thunderhog> LORE button
[1:13:55] <%Afterman_> @Menitta quantum ranger. he was the acto4
[1:13:57] <Afrosamasenpai> Quantam
[1:13:57] <%ggbhtg> Dan Southworth (Vergil) was Eric Meyers / Quantum Ranger in this game, AND back in the day in Power Rangers Time Force
[1:13:57] <%Afterman_> actor*
[1:13:58] <dds333a> why would Scorpina NOT be there
[1:14:00] <@Solidus_113> Quantum Ranger
[1:14:00] <+hypemaster19> he's an ape?
[1:14:01] <Applecannon63> Red ranger is bascially Sol
[1:14:01] <@Menitta> Oh sick

[1:14:08] <zeekayart> he goldar
[1:14:12] <+Basilias_Maximus> What's the character lore for Ryu and Chun-li?

[1:14:20] <DedlokPM> @Menitta Vergil does Vergil's voice
[1:14:28] <FlowLethal> Eric was just Vergil at same time
[1:14:33] <@Menitta> I probably shouldve gotten the super edition. I just got the standard and Ryu/Chun
[1:14:37] <n_0x> @Menitta the ranger he played on the show , eric myers
[1:14:39] <%Afterman_> @whoguru5 i can promise you, they go even FURTHER beyond that shit. the comics are insane atm
[1:14:44] <Kiari13> wow that was fast
[1:14:45] <whoguru5> good rooH
[1:14:47] <zeekayart> love power ranger time force
[1:14:49] <$Superdandy96> Hell yeah, Dragonzord is awesome
[1:14:52] <@Menitta> Had no idea he was in Power Rangers
[1:15:01] <dds333a> Mr. and Mrs. Street Fighter
[1:15:04] <andre11dr> Damn the mall goth Chun costume LUL
[1:15:05] <Zyzallar> Wait ryu and chunli in powerranger?
[1:15:06] <FrostedZaibatsu> tppowerYellow tppowerRed tppowerPink tppowerBlue tppowerGreen tppowerWhite Ranger Up
[1:15:06] <Zyzallar> Pog
[1:15:07] <+AWKWARDL0SER> There’s that Ryu charisma
[1:15:10] <Super_Voltekka> Teen Chun-Li strai ghar t outta SF2V LUL
[1:15:12] <Nameless0100> Wait...what is this?
[1:15:12] <%Afterman_> @Menitta there are tons of power ranger actors in devil may cry. the only lasting good thing from reuben
[1:15:18] <zeekayart> i miss mall goths :(
[1:15:26] <Shad0wTag> @menitta Reuben Langdon aka Dante was also in PR as he did alot of stunts for them
[1:15:26] <zeekayart> where'd they go!!!!!???
[1:15:28] <abbock> donkey kick is 214L after a tatsu
[1:15:33] <Nameless0100> Is this a mod or something?
[1:15:34] <+Radiantomega> Out of all the new guys Woolie would probably vibe with Dai Shi and RJ
[1:15:45] <@Menitta> Oh wow didnt know that either
[1:15:48] <@Menitta> Thats rad
[1:15:53] <Shad0wTag> @menitta Same with Johnny Young Bosch as Nero he was quite a few rangers across several seasons
[1:16:02] <+ShinobiPhoenix> Ryu and Chun Li got in from a live action Cross over with the comics, Guile, Cammy, and Bison are part of it too. there's a video for it
[1:16:03] <$Superdandy96> Say the line Eric!
[1:16:05] <drefizz> RJ's actor was also vergil in DmC
[1:16:10] <Shad0wTag> @radiantomega RJ and Dai Shi are waaay up Woolie's alley
[1:16:11] <Nameless0100> This is dope
[1:16:12] <+GG_Chefboyardee> pretty sure all the mall goths have OF's now hggLul
[1:16:13] <Kiari13> LUL
[1:16:14] <Applecannon63> Johnny has been both Black and Green Ranger
[1:16:15] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[1:16:30] <andre11dr> @zeekayart Probably aged into vegan cat ladies
[1:16:35] <Applecannon63> whiffed
[1:16:36] <Dave_VD> @Nameless0100 No it's a legit full release. Been out for awhile
[1:16:38] <%mr_sups> Face cam a bit too big
[1:16:39] <Shad0wTag> @gg_chefboyardee hey its a free market
[1:16:41] <abbock> so are they going to pop online and get ToD'd by someone
[1:16:42] <Meltgar> Did PW BftG already finished with all DLC?
[1:16:48] <Nameless0100> @Dave_VD Cool
[1:17:00] <drefizz> @Meltgar nope
[1:17:05] <Meltgar> Coop
[1:17:05] <Tunamanguy> i think more dlc is coming
[1:17:07] <Meltgar> *Cool
[1:17:07] <drefizz> theres more coming
[1:17:08] <Shad0wTag> @meltgar We don't know
[1:17:16] <%ggbhtg> So not ONLY was Rueben Langdon IN Power Rangers Time Force, which is why he knew to bring in Dan Southworth as Vergil, but he was stunt actor in the early seasons, AND he was the extra "white ranger" Beetleborg, on the original Japanese version of that season.
[1:17:19] <Applecannon63> man the Mega Rangers show is just oof
[1:17:26] <@Solidus_113> Camera's pretty big, it's blocking a lot of the close-up action @WoolieVersus
[1:17:28] <RAH001> Cam a little to big
[1:17:30] <poor_ppl> no birthday for regg
[1:17:31] <Nameless0100> Pog
[1:17:34] <@Solidus_113> I think maybe 20% smaller should be fine
[1:17:34] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:17:41] <%Afterman_> @ggbhtg  man.. reuben use to be so cool. to bad he had to fucking ruin his image.
[1:17:41] <jumpyhugs> 90's pog'
[1:17:46] <dds333a> the white people jacket around the waist LUL
[1:17:53] <@Solidus_113> that should be good
[1:17:57] <Kiari13> yeha it was hard to see the center of the action LUL
[1:18:02] <@Menitta> Ryu would be an honorable weirdo
[1:18:04] <dds333a> not bad
[1:18:05] <mephium> SeemsGood
[1:18:06] <iacus_> Should be ok. it was blocking too much of the action in the middle
[1:18:06] <Shad0wTag> @afterman_ God I want him to run it back and be normal again
[1:18:13] <DedlokPM> Might be better
[1:18:20] <andre11dr> @dds333a That's a fennel dude LUL
[1:18:25] <%Afterman_> @Shad0wTag idk if that's even possible anymore. hes faaaar gone. and i use to be a huge fan
[1:18:29] <$Superdandy96> @ggbhtg huh, I never knew DMC was that close to PR
[1:18:30] <+GG_Chefboyardee> I feel like Tommy Ryu and Jason would be some unbreakable bro group lol
[1:18:32] <%Waage83> or top middle we dont need the time
[1:18:32] <Applecannon63> Well Tommy is kinda of a douche both character and actor
[1:18:33] <turboyabo> reggie why would tommy hate on ryu
[1:18:33] <Meltgar> Reggie feels farther away, WOOLIE-CAM looks fine
[1:18:38] <Dave_VD> @Menitta Vergil's voice actor plays that character in live action. He's a really talented martial artist. There is also a sick movie that he and Johnny Yon-Bosch (Nero) made where they have a crazy ass fight scene. I believe it's called "The Broken Path"
[1:18:43] <dds333a> @andre11dr fennel? like the seed? Kappa
[1:18:45] <%ozzrabbit> Go to your corners!
[1:18:47] <Majestic_Flof> reggie getting in some quick hits
[1:18:47] <hamahiroyuki> this Ryu costume reminds me The Warriors movie, although I never finished the movie
[1:18:49] <+Basilias_Maximus> Twitch really doesn't like those particle effects.
[1:18:49] <alphalejandro> Umm...it's off center
[1:18:49] <RAH001> Maybe put it on the timer ?
[1:18:50] <Dave_VD> yong*
[1:18:51] <andre11dr> Sure
[1:18:56] <Shad0wTag> @afterman_ I know but damn its a shame
[1:18:57] <dylheim93> off centre
[1:19:05] <poor_ppl> i feel like bulk and skull would try to bully ryu hard
[1:19:08] <+Hollow_Mirage> Casual Ryu is weird
[1:19:10] <%TubeMan642> @woolieversus try putting it over the match timer
[1:19:11] <%ggbhtg> @Afterman_ I don't know, apparently he was into alien theories for years, so whatever else he's been doing, isn't exactly far fetched.
[1:19:17] <FlowLethal> Who would woolie and Reggie be in power rangers
[1:19:27] <%mr_sups> Ranger suit without Helmet is a cool look
[1:19:34] <Kiari13> Chun's ranger suit is so cool
[1:19:35] <Shad0wTag> @ggbhtg add covid denying to the mix now
[1:19:40] <@Menitta> Ryu's and Chunner;s special just launches
[1:19:45] <%Afterman_> @Shad0wTag  yea it suck @ggbhtg  hes an anti-science anti-vax dumbass, alongside blaming the metoo movement and BLM, you should look into the garbage he has spewed
[1:19:46] <TehMud> Ryu is crazy in this game
[1:19:51] <QThaGawd> ryu and chun are specifically MVC3 style @WoolieVersus
[1:19:58] <Meltgar> Wait they haven't added Rito Revolto in the roster?? But he was one of those villains who beated the PW at first
[1:20:05] <+Kiaayo> eric NEEDS MORE POWER
[1:20:09] <whoguru5> POWER rooH
[1:20:13] <FacetiousAF> !motivated
[1:20:13] <@Moobot> @FacetiousAF 2289 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[1:20:22] <andre11dr> No mouth movement, did Fromsoft make this game?
[1:20:23] <alphalejandro> Quantum Power
[1:20:28] <Shad0wTag> @afterman_ I didn't know about the last two god damn it
[1:20:29] <DedlokPM> I NEED MOAR POWER rooH
[1:20:35] <axelkaspar> So this is the game that has online VS across all the platforms?
[1:20:39] <@Solidus_113> yes
[1:20:42] <%Prevot> man it's fucking hilarious how Eric is the 6th ranger, but he's just ANOTHER red ranger
[1:20:43] <+PolloSucio_> yes
[1:20:45] <%ggbhtg> @Superdandy96 The PR DMC extends to Itsuno himself, he was inspired by Hurricanger / Ninja Storm (and Mazinger) to do Sin Devil Triggers and such for DMC5
[1:20:46] <Dave_VD> @Meltgar His design is awful aesthetically though
[1:20:51] <artificiallynatural> yup full crossplay
[1:20:51] <drefizz> @andre11dr the game was made on a lower budget
[1:20:56] <+ShinobiPhoenix> @meltgar Rito is not part of the comics or storyline this game is based on. the Boom Studios comics
[1:20:57] <%Afterman_> @Shad0wTag yeah, there have been some people who claimed he would post anti-jew conspiracy theories on his private fb years ago. idk if thats really true though
[1:21:14] <Kiari13> NotATK purple balls
[1:21:18] <Kiari13> NotLikeThis
[1:21:35] <dds333a> nope LUL
[1:21:41] <@Menitta> Chun;s heavy combo links to her super
[1:21:41] <drefizz> Think we can all collectively agree Reuben is a shit casvdpLUL
[1:21:44] <Shad0wTag> @afterman_ I guess we can only go off of whats public for now
[1:21:54] <andre11dr> Ah this game is such beautiful kusoge
[1:21:59] <Meltgar> @ShinobiPhoenix Aaaahh understandable... Thx for info.
[1:22:11] <n_0x> @ShinobiPhoenix any ranger and villain from the the franchise can be here (except ivan ooze for rights reasons) as evidenced by ceno blue from the movie being in the roseter
[1:22:23] <andre11dr> Like almost everyone has TODs in this game LUL
[1:22:25] <BlackermanZX> Ryu combos are crazy in this game
[1:22:25] <Shad0wTag> I try to pretend Super Megaforce doesn't exists and that this is secretly Gokaiger
[1:22:28] <TheactualDiepod> Is this the best ryu's been in a tag game?
[1:22:42] <Samex_Comex> Stronger then before, goooo zeo!
[1:22:46] <dds333a> @theactualdiepod LUL
[1:22:50] <+killfrost11> i kind of need chun-lee ranger now
[1:22:54] <+ShinobiPhoenix> @n_0x The movie people are part of the mobile game AND the comics
[1:23:01] <Dave_VD> Oh yeah this game is straight kusoge
[1:23:04] <+GG_Chefboyardee> Power Rangers just makes me miss Guyver even more shofuWhy
[1:23:06] <Dave_VD> So fun though
[1:23:10] <%SirGO0SE> chun li ranger is so damn cool
[1:23:11] <+ShinobiPhoenix> so, no, they are following the comics quite a bit
[1:23:30] <@Menitta> Admittedly the only power rangers thing I've seen was the 2017 movie which was wack
[1:23:34] <Broand> Is that a gokaigar
[1:23:38] <andre11dr> Chun ranger works better than Ryu as a ranger
[1:23:45] <dds333a> @menitta LUL LUL LUL
[1:23:48] <andre11dr> Cause she's a cop
[1:23:48] <whoguru5> Gokaiger was my first sentai and yes it was as confusing as you think that would be LUL
[1:23:50] <+ShinobiPhoenix> @broand Yes that is Gokaiger
[1:23:56] <Shad0wTag> @broand We pretend it is
[1:24:13] <+ShinobiPhoenix> well yeaj, we pretend it's the Sentai
[1:24:16] <Shad0wTag> Neo Saban was a mistake
[1:24:27] <clumsydemiurge> he said it
[1:24:32] <artificiallynatural> HE SAID THE THING
[1:24:34] <Applecannon63> @broand yeah cause it was localized as Super mega ranger but as sequel to Mega Ranger…
[1:24:35] <+GG_Chefboyardee> he said the thing lmao
[1:24:35] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:24:36] <Shad0wTag> God I miss the Disney era bar Operation Overdrive
[1:24:46] <+ShinobiPhoenix> I wish they would just make the Kamen Rider crossover in the comics to justify them coming in
[1:24:50] <alphalejandro> The Disney era was fine...even good
[1:24:52] <%AlteisenReiseZ> QUICK CHAT. BEST POWER RANGERS OPENING
[1:24:54] <Afrosamasenpai> Gokaiger's a damn good starting point though
[1:25:02] <BlackermanZX> SPD is still my absolute favorite
[1:25:04] <+ShinobiPhoenix> @shad0wtag Jungle Fury was bad too
[1:25:05] <Shad0wTag> It is@afrosamasenpai
[1:25:13] <Broand> Akibaranger's OP is the best one
[1:25:18] <Shad0wTag> @shinobiphoenix I enjoyed Jungle Fury quite a bit
[1:25:29] <+ShinobiPhoenix> but Jungle Fury is where I stopped trying to care about American Power Rangers at all
[1:25:30] <%ozzrabbit> Woolie needs more Quantum Power!
[1:25:35] <slimey0> i love these fucking maegazord sized assists
[1:25:38] <Applecannon63> @shinobiphoenix There was Kamen Rider RX dubbed as Masked Rider and it was terrible
[1:25:41] <Meltgar> Surprised but, which PW aren't really remembered? Space? or Ninja storm?
[1:25:46] <Shad0wTag> @shinobiphoenix After the shitty PR Samurai I peaced out
[1:25:47] <whoguru5> I will always spout my love for lightspeed
[1:25:50] <Meltgar> Speed?
[1:25:52] <@Menitta> Slayer's zoning is bullshit lmao
[1:25:54] <%Afterman_> @Shad0wTag  have you ever watched gekirangers, the sentai jungle fury is based  on? If not you should. imo its the best sentai season
[1:25:54] <whoguru5> but SPD themes SLAPS HARD
[1:25:57] <Shad0wTag> @meltgar Operation Overdrive for sure
[1:26:00] <+GG_Chefboyardee> Ninja storm was dope
[1:26:01] <%AlteisenReiseZ> DINO THUNDER BEST SEASON though
[1:26:05] <dds333a> chunked, jeez
[1:26:16] <whoguru5> limesD LIGHTSPEED RESCUE IS GREAT
[1:26:16] <Kiari13> LUL
[1:26:17] <alphalejandro> @Applecannon63 Ah with the weird little bear duck thingy
[1:26:18] <Shad0wTag> @afterman_ I have seen Gekiranger but their different enough that I don't see one as lesser
[1:26:20] <TheactualDiepod> I wish they got Amy Jo to play ranger slayer
[1:26:22] <kingbreaker21> GGs on that!
[1:26:22] <BlackermanZX> Ninja Storm and SPD are dope
[1:26:30] <andre11dr> From which Power Ranger does Quantum Ranger come from?
[1:26:40] <+PolloSucio_> time force
[1:26:41] <%Prevot> I stopped caring at Wild Force but later found out Ninja Storm was awesome and I'd loved it as a kid
[1:26:46] <masterfire23> SPD is so cool
[1:26:49] <FrostedZaibatsu> Shallow combos huh LUL
[1:27:00] <Broand> Where's akibared :<
[1:27:02] <Shad0wTag> @andre11dr Time Force
[1:27:02] <artificiallynatural> anubis is sick
[1:27:03] <%ggbhtg> @Applecannon63 @Broand What are these words you are saying LUL They adapted Goseiger as a season called Megaforce, and Gokaiger became a sequel to that, known as Super Megaforce. Both seasons were creatively bankrupt, with a director who gave the actors no story to work with, and only really cared about churning out episodes to highlight more and more merchandise.
[1:27:04] <+ShinobiPhoenix> @shad0wtag Sunglasses Morphers instead of what Gekiranger used? and not the cool way GoBusters did it? The fake 3 Rangers? The BS with their Lion guy?
[1:27:08] <%Afterman_> @Shad0wTag im just sad they wasted long's first transformation form on some random mook in JF. Long is easily one of my most favorite villains ever.
[1:27:18] <Applecannon63> @alphalejandro not just that but the terrible redub of the all kamen rider crossover where every rider's names were fucking switched
[1:27:18] <dds333a> I don't know about you guys, but my favorite thing about Sentai are the monsters
[1:27:31] <%TubeMan642> I wish they would add some Dino Thunder characters
[1:27:50] <+ShinobiPhoenix> yes, and they robbed Long. literally the best Sentai villain ever, second is Enter.
[1:28:00] <DedlokPM> I remember seeing Anubius out of his Ranger outfit and thinking that was a change they made Stateside. Then I looked him up and found I was so so wrong
[1:28:01] <$Superdandy96> @tubeman642 I’m shocked there isn’t any yet. I’m willing to bet the white one will be in the game
[1:28:05] <Shad0wTag> @shinobiphoenix I don't think the morpher change was a negative. Go Busters is dope though
[1:28:08] <+GG_Chefboyardee> VR Troopers tho hggLul
[1:28:16] <%Afterman_> @ShinobiPhoenix im so glad someone agrees with me, lmao. I feel vindicated
[1:28:18] <dds333a> @gg_chefboyardee LUL LUL LUL

[1:29:18] <Dave_VD> @ggbhtg The hilarious thing is that Gokaiger had a pirate theme, but megaforce didn't play into it at all. They have flintlock pistols and cutlasses and their megazord is a pirate ship but it's never explained at all
[1:29:18] <%TubeMan642> @superdandy96 The white Dino ranger is so cool he should've been here

[1:30:41] <dds333a> @jackernaut sure is
[1:30:42] <drefizz> I grew up with the Ninja Storm, Dino Thunder and SPD phases of PR, I didn't remember much from time force except the Owl and the blue ranger being a child since I was like 3 LUL
[1:30:42] <TheactualDiepod> I wish it were actually zach doing hiphop kido
[1:30:44] <mephium> NotLikeThis *
[1:30:45] <Shad0wTag> Honestly I'm willing to give Hasbro a chance more than Saban
[1:30:47] <+Jackernaut> sick
[1:30:49] <+ShinobiPhoenix> Boukenger to Go-Busters is literally the best Arc of Sentai ever
[1:30:57] <+BananaSlammuh> @jackernaut Chun Li in too
[1:31:12] <+Jackernaut> @BananaSlammuh might actually have to pick this game up
[1:31:14] <Shad0wTag> @drefizz The blue ranger child thing was from Turbo
[1:31:18] <AudioSpiral> holy shit he actually just says hado and tatsu?
[1:31:21] <drefizz> ok that was turbo
[1:31:28] <alphalejandro> @Shad0wTag Justin?
[1:31:32] <drefizz> So then I don't remember shit from time force LUL
[1:31:32] <Shad0wTag> @shinobiphoenix Agreed. Shinkenger is great
[1:31:37] <Shad0wTag> @alphalejandro Yep
[1:31:37] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts

[1:31:51] <+ShinobiPhoenix> even Goseiger is good, it's just not as strong as some of the others like Boukenger, Gekiranger, GoOnger, and GOKAIGER!
[1:31:52] <+projectmanatees> Oh kat is cool and so is doggie kruger
[1:31:56] <%Afterman_> @ShinobiPhoenix I just looked up Enter, and oh my god the fucking swag with his scarf cape
[1:32:05] <drefizz> I swear Twitch needs to do another PR marathon
[1:32:11] <whoguru5> ^
[1:32:15] <FrostedZaibatsu> Who was the Murder Red Ranger?
[1:32:15] <drefizz> that shit was fun to watch with everyone
[1:32:19] <Shad0wTag> @shinobiphoenix Hype for the Gokaiger 10 movie?
[1:32:20] <mephium> the ads will probably ruin it NotLikeThis
[1:32:29] <Applecannon63> Gokaiger is just a much fun Goseiget
[1:32:36] <Shad0wTag> @frostedzaibatsu Be more specific bud
[1:32:46] <%Prevot> @FrostedZaibatsu wild force red ranger I think, but I think there was another one too
[1:32:49] <TehMud> Now THAT'S a happy birthday

[1:32:53] <alphalejandro> Happy B-Day!
[1:32:54] <Applecannon63> because they use the Ranger legacy gimmick well
[1:32:57] <slimey0> supers are nuts in this game jesus
[1:33:02] <Applecannon63> plus fun story
[1:33:06] <mephium> that shield LUL
[1:33:12] <FrostedZaibatsu> @Shad0wTag WTF Rangers really be out here like that
[1:33:22] <+ShinobiPhoenix> I haven't watched Sentai since Go-Busters and I hated even the premise of that next Dinosaurs show because I am so done with Dinosaurs, but maybe I will check that Gokaiger special out
[1:33:27] <dds333a> @shad0wtag he's talking about the Nezi Rangers Kappa
[1:33:27] <Meltgar> NOTHING PERSONAL WOOLIE Kappa
[1:33:31] <n_0x> @ShinobiPhoenix i know that's the game's story mode and as evidenced by the story mode any ranger and villain from the franchise's history(except ivan ooze) can be here, even rito who is in the mobile game
[1:33:32] <FrostedZaibatsu> He kinda looked like Rambo is all i know
[1:33:39] <alphalejandro> Nice ending
[1:33:40] <+unfortunatpanda> 100
[1:33:44] <+projectmanatees> 100
[1:33:44] <+ShinobiPhoenix> I know I should watch the current Anniversary Sentai

[1:34:01] <andre11dr> On that day Ryu died
[1:34:05] <whoguru5> Kyoryuger was great I will stand by that
[1:34:08] <Shad0wTag> Dai Shi Woolie
[1:34:09] <+GG_Chefboyardee> lore wise is he actually ranger 100 tho
[1:34:11] <%mr_sups> Try RJ
[1:34:16] <Kiari13> monkaS
[1:34:17] <%ggbhtg> modern kusoge indeed LUL
[1:34:17] <andre11dr> Yeah SPD has awesome designs
[1:34:18] <AudioSpiral> Oh I didn't realize it's literally just Ryu and Chun lmfao
[1:34:19] <Meltgar> Bugged?
[1:34:31] <Vyslanec> RJ is dope, I recommend trying him
[1:34:34] <Shad0wTag> RJ Woolie
[1:34:37] <TheactualDiepod> Scorpina's voice still bothers me
[1:34:39] <drunken_lemur> What would a Street Fighter Megazord be like?
[1:34:41] <+projectmanatees> dai shi wasnt that cool in the series
[1:34:52] <+unfortunatpanda> RJ!
[1:35:02] <Kiari13> LUL
[1:35:14] <+ShinobiPhoenix> @n_0x if it FITS THE COMIC too. The Green Psycho Ranger would DEFINITELY get in first considering how ultra important he is
[1:35:18] <alphalejandro> 90's Evil Ryu
[1:35:22] <masterfire23> jungle fury
[1:35:25] <%Prevot> @drunken_lemur like a shoto
[1:35:35] <%kotl7> Bazelgeuse armor
[1:35:39] <%Afterman_> scorpina Kreygasm
[1:35:44] <Shad0wTag> Big crossups
[1:35:46] <Applecannon63> @drunken_lemur it be Zangief
[1:35:49] <%Prevot> scorpina Kreygasm
[1:35:58] <+ShinobiPhoenix> Kuroshi Rio
[1:36:13] <+SanguineQuest> Needs more Quantum Ranger
[1:36:16] <Shad0wTag> That throw OTGS i think
[1:36:19] <BlackermanZX> Green Samurai Ranger from Ninja Storm would be so sick in this game
[1:36:30] <+ShinobiPhoenix> Strength of a Lion, Voice of a Lion
[1:36:40] <dds333a> eat your heart out Akuma
[1:36:43] <mike2hands> YOOOH
[1:36:43] <%Afterman_> man, Rio is probably the coolest human villain in sentai
[1:36:43] <Iwashi94> holy shit
[1:36:50] <Applecannon63> We need more Power Ranger Zeo
[1:36:54] <@Menitta> YO
[1:36:54] <Kiari13> PogChamp
[1:36:55] <drunken_lemur> @ShinobiPhoenix Sounds like Kevin Michael Richardson
[1:36:57] <@Menitta> THAT WAS SICK
[1:36:57] <Afrosamasenpai> YEYEYEYEYE JD LETS GOOOOOO
[1:37:00] <alphalejandro> Wolf Puncher
[1:37:01] <%AlteisenReiseZ> RJ is fuckin RAD
[1:37:02] <Vyslanec> I knew woolie would like RJ
[1:37:04] <+ShinobiPhoenix> @blackermanzx Green Samurai is major in the comics, but not so much Shattered Grid, but he should get in
[1:37:04] <drefizz> I kinda want the red dino thunder ranger cause of his battleizer
[1:37:05] <drunken_lemur> I KNEW Woolie would like RJ!
[1:37:08] <Applecannon63> so Johnny yong bosch can join
[1:37:12] <FrostedZaibatsu> I remeber Ninja Storm being the last Ranger series i watched
[1:37:13] <Dave_VD> Dai shi so fucking cool in this game
[1:37:27] <+SanguineQuest> Yeaaaah Gold Ranger
[1:37:27] <%mr_sups> Bite the Wheel
[1:37:28] <+ShinobiPhoenix> the Solaris Ranger should totally get in even if she is later after this storyline
[1:37:33] <andre11dr> Damb mui tai ranger
[1:37:34] <CryptusMaximus> Scorpina is baller af, but I find she NEEDS lab time. You can't just accidentally do cool shit with her.
[1:37:39] <%Afterman_> @ShinobiPhoenix AND the omega rangers
[1:37:51] <%Afterman_> @ShinobiPhoenix give me an empyreal Kreygasm
[1:37:55] <%Afterman_> or a morphin master
[1:37:55] <Applecannon63> RJ is literally voiced by Dmc Devil May Cry Vergil
[1:38:01] <drunken_lemur> RJ's maropher is so cool, with the little boxing ring bell.
[1:38:02] <Dave_VD> I'm gonna have to go back through the vod to catch all these Sentai and Kamen Rider recommendations
[1:38:08] <dds333a> OUCH
[1:38:15] <%ggbhtg> Regarding Power Rangers vs Super Sentai......it's like comparing a 4Kids adaptation vs the original adaptation. You can get something like Yugioh and Pokemon that everyone loves and remembers regardless, that still stands on its own....but when you look back at the original, they may as well be 2 different shows. Which is intentional, and that's fine in it's own right. So in a way, there's not much to compare.
[1:38:19] <+ShinobiPhoenix> @afterman Solar and Omega  and Hyper force should totally get in, especially Hyperforce yl
[1:38:20] <TehMud> ITs mahvel baby
[1:38:22] <%Afterman_> @Dave_VD  Gekirangers first. it has the best human villain and true villain
[1:38:22] <+ShinobiPhoenix> Yellow
[1:38:23] <alphalejandro> And Reggie get SFVied
[1:38:31] <Shad0wTag> If we could get either Green Mystic Force Ranger or some Wild Force rep i would be so happy
[1:38:36] <BlackermanZX> this version of chun is nuts
[1:38:37] <+ShinobiPhoenix> since Hyperforce Yellow is absolutely part of Shattered Grid
[1:38:37] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1423196401152974850?s=19
[1:38:49] <dds333a> @ggbhtg truth
[1:38:50] <drefizz> @Applecannon63 I don't think he does the voice for him in the game, but yeah he is the same guy who was vergil in DmC
[1:39:15] <andre11dr> I like how they just put her SFV super right in ,there's no difference to it LUL
[1:39:16] <Applecannon63> FEEL MY WRATH
[1:39:27] <+ShinobiPhoenix> Plus Hyperforce Yellow is played by Bulk's original actor
[1:39:28] <DedlokPM> @drefizz If you mean Quantum Power Ranger, yes, it is Vergil that does this voice in the game
[1:39:30] <drefizz> "And I'm your" What?
[1:39:38] <drunken_lemur> I'm just gonna say it: Juri should have been included in the phone game.
[1:39:42] <%Afterman_> @DedlokPM  no. in DmC, vergil is RJ
[1:39:45] <drefizz> @DedlokPM nah RJ is also a Vergil actor
[1:39:46] <Dave_VD> @Afterman_ Dope, I'll check it out
[1:39:52] <+BananaSlammuh> @drefizz waifu Kreygasm
[1:39:58] <drefizz> Theres 2 different Vergil VAs in this game
[1:40:01] <+ShinobiPhoenix> basically this game has TWO Vergila
[1:40:03] <%Afterman_> @Dave_VD  enjoy! Feel free to pm me after you watch it!
[1:40:23] <+SanguineQuest> Quantum Ranger being voiced by Vergil makes perfect sense because he was the most Vergil Power Ranger of all time
[1:40:24] <+ShinobiPhoenix> Gekiviolet and Timefire
[1:40:29] <dds333a> There's Dan, and I'm forgetting the other right?
[1:40:52] <Meltgar> Why there isn't a PW Rufus? Kappa
[1:41:09] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[1:41:11] <drefizz> RJ/Wolf ranger is the DmC actor but not sure he voices him in the game
[1:41:11] <Dave_VD> @Afterman_ Is there a good place to watch them all?
[1:41:14] <@Menitta> oh man RJ is cool
[1:41:15] <BlackermanZX> whens woolieGLORY Battle for the Grid
[1:41:20] <+ShinobiPhoenix> Jungle Fury's Wolf Ranger, RJ is the other Vergil

[1:41:27] <+thedream_c> WOOOO
[1:41:29] <n_0x> @ShinobiPhoenix 2 things, first everyone wants the psycho rangers and secondly it doesn't they just have to be apart of the franchise and not named ivan ooze

[1:41:58] <%mr_sups> CRY FOR THE MOON!
[1:42:04] <+the22cstomp> i knew woolie would love RJ
[1:42:05] <%Prevot> Quantum Ranger predates DMC, so does that mean Vergil is an Eric, instead of the other way around?
[1:42:11] <n_0x> @Meltgar yup that's why he can't be here
[1:42:16] <Dave_VD> RJ, Quantum Ranger, and OG red ranger is my dream team
[1:42:24] <Meltgar> Man that sucks
[1:42:24] <Applecannon63> LUNAR CYCLONE
[1:42:31] <Shad0wTag> @woolieversus your unironically playing another Vergil your welcome
[1:42:45] <Pookiedaexzile> A fun Ryu costume someone call Capcom This is Illegal
[1:43:01] <BlackermanZX> theres some wild TODs in this game
[1:43:10] <Applecannon63> Gekiranger cast is so good
[1:43:18] <%mr_sups> Dai Shi is Black Panther / Necali
[1:43:24] <+thedream_c> ^^^
[1:43:25] <Super_Voltekka> So how long until we get Astronoma in this game?
[1:43:26] <+SanguineQuest> @Prevot A Thinking Emoji question for the ages
[1:43:39] <Applecannon63> I wish Melee was an assist for Kuroshi Reo
[1:43:41] <+MegaQuint> Jungle Fury up in here
[1:43:43] <Shad0wTag> Lads hear me out we get Iggy from RPM and we make him a joke character like Dan
[1:43:44] <%Afterman_> @Applecannon63 it makes me so happy to see others appreciate geki lol
[1:43:46] <drefizz> Oh shit he can duck fire balls?
[1:43:48] <+ShinobiPhoenix> @n_0x No, they've been following people that make sense for the story of the comic too, that's called game design. or you would just do anything. it's like people asking for Agumon in Smash, even though the rule is Video game people only (and Agumon is Toy and anime first)
[1:43:52] <Louie_Salmon> Does this africa-man seriously have an aegis reflector
[1:44:11] <drefizz> LUL
[1:44:11] <+thedream_c> LUL
[1:44:13] <Dave_VD> They seriously need to add Deker from samurai. His design is godlike
[1:44:15] <+thedream_c> KIRIN RANGER
[1:44:17] <dds333a> snapback LUL
[1:44:22] <%Afterman_> @Louie_Salmon technically he's an immortal multi-headed dragon
[1:44:29] <+thedream_c> they might as well make a PRgame full of the '6th' cool rangers like Kirin Ranger
[1:44:38] <%Afterman_> he's just possessing someone
[1:44:47] <andre11dr> Is RJ played by Rubin Langdon? He sounds a lot like Ken
[1:44:53] <masterfire23> I kinda wanna see SPD omega ranger
[1:44:54] <+ShinobiPhoenix> @n_0x the mobile game is less resources and mostly all over the place for bonus people to spend money on, but for the bigger game that take more resources, yiu need to rein it in
[1:44:55] <dds333a> ryu is safe LUL
[1:44:56] <%Afterman_> @andre11dr it does sound like him yea
[1:45:27] <coreybom> @andre11dr No he’s voiced by DmC vergil. Was played by him too in the show, so this game has TWO vergils.
[1:45:33] <+kevlarkoala> so does this just have an entirely different story in Japan?
[1:45:35] <+ShinobiPhoenix> there's people I want too, but I wouldn't want just anyone that doesn't fit either.
[1:45:37] <Applecannon63> @andre11dr no but he is someone who voiced Dmc devil may cry Vergil
[1:45:37] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:45:44] <BlackermanZX> RJ has straight up Terry's burn knuckle
[1:46:06] <andre11dr> So that's Dan huh ,he really sounds like Ken here
[1:46:10] <Shad0wTag> @kevlarkoala Yes they are different shows. PR pulls footage from the original and add their own to make their own story
[1:46:18] <+kevlarkoala> no, i mean this game
[1:46:20] <Dave_VD> RJ's even got muay thai wraps as PART of his suit
[1:46:20] <+humbelpie> I wonder if the devs will put in Blue Centurion from Turbo?
[1:46:20] <%Afterman_> @andre11dr no. that's not dan. dan is the quantum ranger
[1:46:25] <+thedream_c> yeah PR is its own show universe
[1:46:27] <Applecannon63> @andre11dr Dmc Reboot Vergil
[1:46:27] <%Afterman_> @andre11dr he sounds like ken because its langdon.
[1:46:32] <ndcoten> power up for the afterlife
[1:46:37] <+thedream_c> very difrferent from Super Sentai storylines
[1:46:38] <+ShinobiPhoenix> I don't know how many more DLC nWay is doing by now, they said they weren't done yet but licensing is licensing
[1:46:39] <%Afterman_> @andre11dr  BUT THE SHOW ACTOR was DmC vergil
[1:46:40] <+SanguineQuest> I want a Lost Galaxy ranger that starts out with their Starship Trooper gear and the Sword and morphs on death like Dark Phoenix
[1:46:43] <Shad0wTag> @humbelpie Do people care for Turbo
[1:46:50] <+humbelpie> no one does
[1:46:50] <andre11dr> Oh you mean DmC Vergil
[1:46:52] <coreybom> @andre11dr No thats not dan. Dan plays the quantam ranger, Thats DmC vergil.
[1:46:55] <andre11dr> ok i see
[1:46:56] <Applecannon63> turbo is kinda eh…
[1:47:05] <%Afterman_> they could not get DmC vergil to reprise so they got langdon
[1:47:07] <+shujojo> I sad there's no korag
[1:47:07] <andre11dr> I kinda forgot DmC existed LUL
[1:47:25] <Applecannon63> MOMMY RANGER
[1:47:29] <+humbelpie> @Shad0wTag fun fact: the Sentai version of Blue Centurion is a parody of Space Sheriff Gavan who is a space cop, the joke is that he is a space traffic cop
[1:47:34] <Qsmash_> oh god I forgot about that blue ranger
[1:47:34] <shadowcrisis> Mighty Morphin Power Rannnnnngeeerrrrrrrsss
[1:47:47] <Zyzallar> @andre11dr best one don't @ me :)
[1:47:48] <+ShinobiPhoenix> Carranger is good, but Turbo is sad. Zero is loved, but Ohranger almost killed Sentai
[1:47:49] <Afrosamasenpai> ayy ice mom
[1:47:49] <Shad0wTag> @humbelpie Ah he's a Metal Heroes ref? neat
[1:47:56] <+humbelpie> @Shad0wTag yes
[1:47:59] <andre11dr> Hey i know that ice lady
[1:48:01] <%Afterman_> @Zyzallar Best one named "DmC devil may cry"
[1:48:03] <gyrobasel> milf ranger
[1:48:06] <CryptusMaximus> Dude Zedd's so metal
[1:48:09] <Dave_VD> Zedd is some cheap ass bullshit in this game
[1:48:16] <dds333a> @afterman_ Kappa
[1:48:18] <Shad0wTag> @shinobiphoenix the whole Ohranger almost killinh sentai was disproven
[1:48:22] <andre11dr> Mystic Ranger right that's what it was called?
[1:48:25] <Applecannon63> Power ranger mystic force/Magiranger is quite the milf
[1:48:27] <+thedream_c> oh yeah humnble I can def see the Space Sherrif influence
[1:48:28] <andre11dr> It's been so long
[1:48:33] <BlackermanZX> Zedd combos are so sick
[1:48:39] <%Prevot> a kids show shouldn't be allowed to have a design as cool as Zed
[1:48:43] <ndcoten> love those minion summon attacks
[1:48:48] <+humbelpie> @Shad0wTag yeah if anything Fiveman almost killed the franchise supposedly
[1:48:52] <+SanguineQuest> Ecliptor from Rangers In Space would own in this game
[1:48:53] <mike2hands> the opening is the hypest shit
[1:48:56] <DerpioParty> I wonder if those putties really are preparing the planet for Big Z's return
[1:48:58] <Pookiedaexzile> Woolie seems to be getting into calligraphy
[1:49:02] <+thedream_c> caster rangers
[1:49:03] <Shad0wTag> @humbelpie That I can buy
[1:49:06] <+ShinobiPhoenix> @shad0wtag and yet Gokaiger went out of its way to shit on Ohranger. it's still known Ohranger was hated by their audience
[1:49:14] <+thedream_c> there were weirder themed sentai shows
[1:49:16] <%Afterman_> @SanguineQuest  ecliptor has recently shown back up in the comics. we also got another universe gender-bent version of ecliptor
[1:49:21] <+shujojo> Would Solarus Knight be a puppet character?
[1:49:21] <+humbelpie> @thedream_c like ToQger
[1:49:24] <+ShinobiPhoenix> carranger is loved by the Japanese
[1:49:30] <Applecannon63> @prevot Zedd is like an original villain to power rangers
[1:49:33] <andre11dr> Mystic Force that's what it was
[1:49:34] <+SanguineQuest> @Afterman_ Nice
[1:49:35] <Shad0wTag> @shinobiphoenix Wasn't this due to the tonal shift as result of the gas attacks that happened when it was airing?
[1:49:41] <%Afterman_> @SanguineQuest shes hot tbh
[1:49:57] <+humbelpie> Sentai's like Jetman, Carranger, and Dekaranger are universally beloved in Japan
[1:49:59] <andre11dr> Everyone has elemental powers, now i remember
[1:50:08] <+shujojo> sad this game isn't 120 characters large so you can get any and all rangers you could ever need
[1:50:19] <Shad0wTag> @humbelpie Honestly Dekaranger and SPD are so equal to me
[1:50:22] <%Afterman_> @shujojo we can dream of next gen version
[1:50:22] <+ShinobiPhoenix> @shad0wtag the same would have applied to GoOnger wouldn't it? when they changed because of the stabbing attack?
[1:50:28] <+humbelpie> @Shad0wTag they are both good
[1:50:41] <Shad0wTag> I like SPD a little more cuz of Jack and Sky's character arcs so much
[1:50:44] <Dave_VD> LOL is it really just called "Carranger"?
[1:50:44] <big_ol_bort> stomps lol
[1:50:48] <ndcoten> THIS GAME IS OVER
[1:50:51] <+thedream_c> yes it is called Carranger
[1:50:52] <mike2hands> the thousand deaths stomp
[1:50:55] <+ShinobiPhoenix> Dekaranger and SPD are about the only EQUAL shows
[1:51:00] <+shujojo> Alternatively we could have some reskins to fill out some rangers
[1:51:04] <Shad0wTag> @shinobiphoenix Luckily Go-onger was liked from the get go
[1:51:05] <Dave_VD> That's fucking tight
[1:51:07] <+humbelpie> would be funny if they put in Masked Rider, but that would require acknowledging Saban's Masked Rider
[1:51:16] <+SanguineQuest> WHAT AN ANSWER
[1:51:18] <aura_00> how is every character so cool?
[1:51:22] <Shad0wTag> @dave_vd Sentai show names usually literal
[1:51:23] <lonosis47> Is this game on phones??????
[1:51:26] <mike2hands> WOOLIE
[1:51:26] <DerpioParty> haw
[1:51:27] <%Sparkseid> LUL
[1:51:27] <mephium> LUL
[1:51:28] <BlackermanZX> robbed LUL
[1:51:30] <+Left_Justified> TIME SCAM
[1:51:32] <TigerClaws12> WE TAKE THOSE
[1:51:32] <mephium> woolie knew
[1:51:33] <Applecannon63> @dave_vd it was called that because there was already a Turbo ranger show in japan
[1:51:33] <mike2hands> NotLikeThis
[1:51:34] <%mr_sups> woolieSMUG woolieSMUG woolieKICKDAD woolieKICKDAD
[1:51:36] <mephium> he fucking knew LUL
[1:51:37] <drefizz> Thanks Obama
[1:51:38] <+shujojo> or even straight echo fighters with 2 or 3 moves changed
[1:51:39] <prime_name> Woolie laming it out like cross tekken
[1:51:41] <+thedream_c> @humbelpie yeah plus I don't think it has the same impact.
[1:51:41] <Pookiedaexzile> The Power of No
[1:51:49] <+humbelpie> @thedream_c i agree
[1:51:51] <+ShinobiPhoenix> it's called Carranger especially because there are Is a Turboranger in Sentai, it's much older than Zyuranger (which is our MMPR)
[1:51:57] <Shad0wTag> @applecannon63 and one remembers turnoranger
[1:52:05] <+thedream_c> also there are mad KR FGs (or arena like fighters) in JP
[1:52:05] <+humbelpie> @ShinobiPhoenix yeah Turboranger came out in the mid 80s i believe
[1:52:12] <+thedream_c> so were covered sorta on that end
[1:52:28] <+humbelpie> just checked Turboranger came out in 1989
[1:52:29] <SCIENCE_25> Wololololo
[1:52:33] <Dave_VD> I gotta check out carranger as well then. Turbo was one of my favorites. It's how I found out I been a Johnny Yong-Bosch fan since I was a little kid, way before I got into DMC
[1:52:35] <Shad0wTag> @thedream_c You referring to the musou like games?
[1:52:35] <+kevlarkoala> i guess a better question is: does this game even exist in Japan?
[1:52:37] <+shujojo> I remember when the Gokaifers were told to turn into TurboRanger but turned into CarRanger by mistake
[1:52:45] <enerkaizer> @kevlarkoala No, because bandai si weird
[1:52:45] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:52:51] <Jontman42> since when was Woolie so much larger than Reggie
[1:53:00] <Shad0wTag> @kevlarkoala Nope its not allowed cuz of licencing between Toei and Hasbro
[1:53:09] <dds333a> @jontman42 LUL LUL
[1:53:10] <lonosis47> This isnt sentai though, its specifically power rangers.
[1:53:14] <+ShinobiPhoenix> I can't believe Power Rangers retconned the Psycho Rangera into being related to Fiveman
[1:53:15] <Qsmash_> that BLODIA punch
[1:53:17] <Shad0wTag> @shujojo Thats how forgotten Turboranger is
[1:53:18] <alphalejandro> PUNCH
[1:53:20] <+FuqBoiSlim> @jontman42 since The Awakening
[1:53:26] <sushahana> LUL
[1:53:28] <enerkaizer> @lonosis47 They actually suggested to make a sentai specific version, but even that got denied
[1:53:30] <+SanguineQuest> Jason should say "Back to action" when he swaps in, prove me wrong (you can't)
[1:53:32] <Shad0wTag> @shinobiphoenix I mean hey why not
[1:53:38] <+shujojo> @Jontman42 Woolie's show he get the closer camera
[1:53:44] <Shad0wTag> @sanguinequest You are so right holy shit
[1:53:48] <+thedream_c> yeah the super sentai branding on a global IP scale is get muddied especially in JP side
[1:53:50] <Dave_VD> Oh shit that reminds me, the gotta put a PSYCHO RANGER into this game too. How could they not?
[1:53:57] <lonosis47> @enerkaizer Excuse me who is "they"
[1:54:04] <+shujojo> btw does reggie ever stream on his own? I'd watch it
[1:54:07] <dds333a> LUL
[1:54:08] <Applecannon63> Mighty morphing power was just a Jyuuranger that borrowed Dairanger's White ranger and megazords
[1:54:19] <Applecannon63> *zyuuranger
[1:54:29] <Shad0wTag> @dave_vd Its likely if they keep following the comics
[1:54:32] <+thedream_c> zooranger :p
[1:54:39] <dds333a> @shujojo he's expressed interest, but not currently
[1:54:43] <lonosis47> @shujojo He said he would like to but they only have the 1 streaming computer
[1:54:47] <enerkaizer> @lonosis47 the makers of this game. They suggested to bandai to make a sentai version of this game, and even that got shot down
[1:54:51] <taeko_ohnuki> @woolieversus will you guys be playing dragon ball when the patch drops?
[1:54:56] <%ggbhtg> @WoolieVersus So there's a bunch of screen tearing going on, if you didn't know
[1:54:58] <@Menitta> does this game have a goddamn KBD
[1:55:17] <andre11dr> Wait so is she the only Mystic Force representative in this game?
[1:55:18] <+ShinobiPhoenix> @dave_vd there already is, they just didn't add him yet, that's why I keep talking about Psycho Green. he's canonically the first Psycho in the comics and formerly of whatever they turned Fiveman into, something called Supersonic Rangers
[1:55:21] <Qsmash_> was that guy the green and white ranger fused together?
[1:55:21] <CryptusMaximus> I love seeing people realize how real this game is lmao
[1:55:28] <+thedream_c> this game is very real
[1:55:36] <+thedream_c> the devs are former FG nut heads themselves
[1:55:45] <+thedream_c> or at least the battle designers
[1:55:46] <alphalejandro> Woolie likes THICC
[1:55:56] <dds333a> LUL
[1:55:56] <+thedream_c> ShadyK released that one giant ass guide for marvel
[1:55:59] <Shad0wTag> @qsmash_ Lord Drakkon, comic exclusive character its an evil altenrate Tommy
[1:56:01] <Applecannon63> @qsmash_ yeah thats Lord Drakkon he is evil tommy
[1:56:05] <enerkaizer> weeird fact: SCoprina is canonically the longest living villain of the OG villains. she lives up to Tommys retirement age, no joker, she even survived the finale of In-space were every villain up to that point dies
[1:56:14] <+thedream_c> yeah some of these chars are from that comic saga
[1:56:14] <drefizz> Vergil Vs Vergil
[1:56:16] <Iwashi94> Vergil PogChamp
[1:56:18] <prime_name> Vergil vs Vergil
[1:56:20] <+thedream_c> ranger slayer, Lord Drakkon
[1:56:20] <+SanguineQuest> HELL YEAH, LETS GOO QUANTUM POWAH
[1:56:24] <Vyslanec> @Qsmash_  it is from the comics, and yes, an evil version of tommy that stole the white ranger's powers and fused it with his green ranger powers
[1:56:24] <Applecannon63> Scorpina is Goldar's waifu
[1:56:25] <%mr_sups> Virgil v Virgil
[1:56:35] <Dave_VD> @Shad0wTag @ShinobiPhoenix That'd be so tight. They're designs are godlike and they showed up in multiple different series. Shit, psycho pink is one of the only villains to straight up murder a power ranger
[1:56:41] <%Afterman_> @Qsmash_ oh man.. have you not read the comics? I can pm you some links, the comics are LEGITIMATELY the best power rangers has ever been. If you are interested in PR you need to read it
[1:56:41] <+humbelpie> Shinkenger is really good, Power Rangers Samurai is really, really, bad
[1:56:42] <andre11dr> Battle of the Virgils
[1:56:43] <Dave_VD> Their*
[1:56:44] <@Menitta> Oh yeah
[1:56:45] <+FuqBoiSlim> How many Vergils does this game have?
[1:56:46] <@Menitta> SHes cool
[1:56:58] <SvenHolgersson> Have the boys tried Trini yet?
[1:56:58] <+kevlarkoala> yo who the fuck IS this guy
[1:57:02] <SvenHolgersson> Cuz holy fuck she rules
[1:57:13] <+thedream_c> oh yeah Trini with dragon armor is tfrom the comics
[1:57:14] <drefizz> 2 and Shadow ranger fights like umvc3 Vergil
[1:57:18] <dds333a> Woolz picked Trini last match
[1:57:18] <Applecannon63> Quantum Ranger is just Cable with Vergil moves
[1:57:20] <enerkaizer> The red samurai ranger was the very first female red ranger in sentai history. however, Power rangers had a canonically female red ranger first in "Power Rangers: SPD"
[1:57:39] <+ShinobiPhoenix> the Boom Comics have a crossover with TMNT AND justice League. I would kill if they justify Leonardo and Batman into this
[1:57:45] <Shad0wTag> SPD does what Samurai wishes
[1:57:46] <+Rada150> I hope if they continue with updates we get Phantom ranger as a mix of reptile and scorpion just tping and cloaking all over teh sscreen
[1:57:57] <+Radiantomega> I am now looking forward to the gods playing wth them
[1:57:59] <Kiari13> LUL
[1:58:00] <enerkaizer> The yellow ranger here is btw wearing the Dragonzord from another timeline as her armor
[1:58:00] <Iwashi94> POWER
[1:58:01] <verscoll> there it is
[1:58:03] <mephium> he said it LUL
[1:58:07] <%AlteisenReiseZ> RAPID SLASH
[1:58:14] <BlackermanZX> I NEED MORE (Quantum) POWER
[1:58:16] <dds333a> cmonBruh
[1:58:17] <Iwashi94> what kind of power is this?
[1:58:18] <Shad0wTag> Man what I'd kill for SPD Red to be in this game. They could make the Battlizer or SWAT mode an install super
[1:58:20] <DedlokPM> I NEED MORE QUANTUM POWER rooH
[1:58:24] <lonosis47> Reading power rangers is like going to Walmart to buy shoes. you're doing it wrong.
[1:58:40] <artificiallynatural> yooo she's sick
[1:58:47] <%Afterman_> @lonosis47 have you...actually read the comics? Because if you had you wouldnt say that lol
[1:59:08] <drefizz> Chi
[1:59:09] <+thedream_c> i mean its one specific storyline too and it fleshes out a pretty memorable piece
[1:59:13] <+SanguineQuest> Does making the Pink Ranger the team leader in Time Force make her a de facto Red Ranger? :thinking:
[1:59:15] <dds333a> LUL LUL
[1:59:16] <enerkaizer> another weird fact: According to the comics, Zack (OG Black ranger) and Trini (OG yellow ranger) end up together
[1:59:17] <+Rada150> you could have Titanium ranger with built in armor, wild force black ranger as a grappler, ninjor as a parry character, Blue Centurion as a gimmick character
[1:59:20] <@Menitta> Ok wow this game totally has a wavedash and KBD

[1:59:24] <@Menitta> thats dope
[1:59:25] <+ShinobiPhoenix> @enerkaizer No, she's not. it's a creation called The Black Dragon, it wss never Dragonzord
[1:59:27] <lonosis47> To put it in perspective, power rangers is what Teen titans go is to teen titans. enjoy your ripoff watered-down version of a great franchise
[1:59:29] <Pt_Kamen> "Will it Kill" moment
[1:59:32] <%ggbhtg> So there's RJ / Wolf , who's on screen actor played DmC Vergil, Eric / Quantum, who's OG Vergil, but THEN THERE'S Cruger / Shadow, who ACTUALLY plays like MvC3 Vergil. ARE THERE ANY OTHER VERGILS I DON'T KNOW ABOUT?
[1:59:34] <SvenHolgersson> GRABBEd
[1:59:46] <+Rada150> I thought they couldn
[1:59:46] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:59:47] <+thedream_c> @Menitta marvel inspired shmmovement. They had forward wave dashes in that game
[1:59:57] <+thedream_c> mvc3 at least
[2:00:00] <%Afterman_> @lonosis47  ok now you're just trolling lol. because the boom comics are made by people who adore and love power rangers. it has brought the franchise to a new high.
[2:00:02] <Applecannon63> @sanguinequest I mean her reason to be leader because the original red ranger in the past/Quantum got benched i
[2:00:03] <+Rada150> I thought they couldn't get RJ's screen actor to do the vocie for this game
[2:00:05] <insufflated_> @lonosis47 don't be the sentai snob here
[2:00:07] <mike2hands> that cable shooting stance
[2:00:07] <enerkaizer> @ShinobiPhoenix Nope, that thing was originally Drakons Dragonzord, they just heavily modifed it. They even state it in the comics multiple times
[2:00:07] <drefizz> Vergil Vs Vergil
[2:00:07] <Dave_VD> Are they gonna hop online?
[2:00:08] <DedlokPM> @lonosis47 Okay.
[2:00:11] <dds333a> @thedream_c dat Magneto tech
[2:00:34] <Pt_Kamen> they might go online, the game has the good netcode
[2:00:34] <%ggbhtg> @Menitta Uuuh I think it's called Plink Dashing in MvC3?
[2:00:38] <+thedream_c> @dds333a but see the marketing at least didn't try point to 'functions'. They just showed the drip, the action and you get in there.
[2:00:49] <+ShinobiPhoenix> @enerkaizer I don't remember that, did he shrink it?
[2:00:59] <dds333a> @thedream_c well, of course
[2:01:00] <+ShinobiPhoenix> they kit bashed a lot of Zora
[2:01:00] <Shad0wTag> @afterman_ I bet this guy thinks sentai is a rip off to PR as well
[2:01:02] <lonosis47> reminder that they aired power rangers on nickelodeon. thats how shit it is
[2:01:06] <+ShinobiPhoenix> ZORDS
[2:01:10] <BlackermanZX> Red Samurai also has big vergil energy
[2:01:21] <+Rada150> you can store RJ's charge and use it in his assist
[2:01:21] <+ShinobiPhoenix> I certainly remember Gravezord
[2:01:22] <drefizz> Sentai ripped off power rangers
[2:01:26] <%Afterman_> @Shad0wTag  dude is definitely just trying to troll for attention. he has nothing but garbage to spew
[2:01:29] <drefizz> I'm kidding chat!
[2:01:33] <@Menitta> @ggbhtg tbf all I've been playing lately is Tekken 7
[2:01:36] <coreybom> @lonosis47 Okay no man. You’re just being a super weeb now, the kind that thinks dubs are disgusting and are offensive to the “art form”.
[2:01:37] <@Menitta> in my defense lol
[2:01:40] <BlackermanZX> technically we have 4 vergils kolGlasses
[2:01:40] <+thedream_c> Shinken Red (female) def got big sword swing energy
[2:01:41] <masterfire23> remember super samurai? me neither
[2:01:45] <enerkaizer> @ShinobiPhoenix yes. again, they heavily modified it. But because it was originally the dragonzord it allowed the MMPR rangers to use its parts afterwards to make the armor for Trini
[2:01:45] <Shad0wTag> @lonosis47 Thats because Nick go the broadcasting rights after Saban bought the full rights back from Disney
[2:01:48] <Qsmash_> they way he shoots his gun is just straight up Cable
[2:01:51] <+Rada150> do people actually use the Gold Ranger?
[2:02:00] <@Menitta> but also I didnt know it was called that in MVC3
[2:02:05] <drefizz> Gold is OD
[2:02:06] <%Afterman_> @Qsmash_  but ye man if u want to read the comics hmu i can assist with that. they are godly
[2:02:07] <SCIENCE_25> Really diggin the Grimjaw Ranger
[2:02:10] <dds333a> @coreybom not entirely a wrong opinion Kappa
[2:02:13] <+thedream_c> oh yeah there was that short time where Disney had MMPR. Then Saban took it back
[2:02:14] <andre11dr> I always called it wave dashing
[2:02:32] <+yamidemon666> oh ye forgot ryu in the game LUL
[2:02:32] <+Rada150> poor magna defender
[2:02:33] <DedlokPM> @lonosis47 I am sure you are also one of those people that decried Nagatoro saying "sus" even tho she said a slang word for suspicious in Japanese as well AND "sus" is a rather old slang word and not new at all
[2:02:34] <+thedream_c> yeah and the wave dashing is more unviersal in the later marvel series
[2:02:46] <+ShinobiPhoenix> Gekiviolet is the truth
[2:02:55] <%ggbhtg> Imma say the thing again
[2:02:57] <+kevlarkoala> it seems like all of the Mystic Force Rangers are NUTS
[2:02:59] <Shad0wTag> @thedream_c It wasn't short it was from Wild Force until RPM
[2:03:00] <%ggbhtg> Regarding Power Rangers vs Sentai arguments on which is "better".....they just don't really share the same market. As an extra point to Sentai, the writing quality of Power Rangers has been 20 years behind, FOR THE PAST 20 YEARS LUL The newest PR season, Dino Fury, actually feels like a modern show when it comes to certain things, but....PR vs Sentai is like comparing 4Kids to the anime they butcher
[2:03:02] <%Afterman_> @ShinobiPhoenix  god yes. He was my favorite
[2:03:03] <coreybom> @dds333a I mean, some more than others. Kappa
[2:03:03] <lonosis47> If any of you bothered to check the differences between sentai and PR you would all be boycotting this shit too but go ahead and continue to stay ignortant *shrug*
[2:03:04] <Qsmash_> @Afterman_ thanks. I might check them out some
[2:03:14] <andre11dr> Yeah wave dashing became more important in Marvel 3
[2:03:18] <%ggbhtg> that was the wrong one, hold up
[2:03:20] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @lonosis47 cope
[2:03:25] <%ggbhtg> Regarding Power Rangers vs Super Sentai......it's like comparing a 4Kids adaptation vs the original adaptation. You can get something like Yugioh and Pokemon that everyone loves and remembers regardless, that still stands on its own....but when you look back at the original, they may as well be 2 different shows. Which is intentional, and that's fine in it's own right. So in a way, there's not much to compare.
[2:03:26] <%Afterman_> @lonosis47 bruh. i much prefer sentai. gekiranger is my favorite season ever, but you are being insane. relax
[2:03:36] <dds333a> @ggbhtg LUL
[2:03:38] <+ShinobiPhoenix> I wish the Rhino Ranger Sentries could get in
[2:03:40] <+thedream_c> @lonosis47 buy more copium fella. you need it more than the rest of us.
[2:03:48] <andre11dr> It was in Marvel 2 but you don't really want to spend much time on the ground in Marvel 2
[2:03:53] <Shad0wTag> @lonosis47 Dude we are just ignoring you now
[2:03:54] <DedlokPM> @lonosis47 Why are you even here then? Go outside and touch grass. And this is coming from someone who hates the phrase "go touch grass"
[2:03:59] <+Rada150> i wonder what hasbro is going to do after Dino Fury they cancelled their contract with toei
[2:04:00] <Applecannon63> Oh no the toku fandom…
[2:04:02] <+ShinobiPhoenix> then at least we get GekiChopper
[2:04:05] <%Afterman_> Anyway I highly recommend everyone go read power ranger comics by boom studios. they are godly and well written.
[2:04:12] <+Rada150> so no more japanese footage
[2:04:13] <+kevlarkoala> lol, the guy coming in screaming about a property that is and always has been meant for children
[2:04:30] <enerkaizer> @Rada150 no, they didn't. that was just a rumor without any corn of truth in it.
[2:04:33] <+thedream_c> damn you kevlar. You gotta make me bust out my philosophical jib on MaskMan :p
[2:04:37] <BlackermanZX> oh he can throw the wheel too
[2:04:40] <@Menitta> Man I really regret not getting the Super edition
[2:04:42] <Applecannon63> This is coming from the toku community which are total shit heads
[2:04:45] <Shad0wTag> @rada150 Wait wheres the proof? i haven't heard anything about Hasbro doing that
[2:04:55] <+Rada150> there is supposedly a sales report
[2:04:55] <lonosis47> @DedlokPM i'm here to join the conversation. and i'm glad i did because there were clearly fellows such as yourself who were ignortant on the subject until i came in here to inform some of you. ggs
[2:04:56] <@Menitta> These characters are all so fucking cool
[2:05:06] <%ggbhtg> The last thing I said, is the thing I meant to say. Power Rangers is not trying to be an English dub of Sentai. It's a different show.
[2:05:08] <enerkaizer> Virgil VS Virgil WutFace
[2:05:09] <dds333a> HONO
[2:05:10] <%Zero_Jacks> lytMOTIVATED More Power
[2:05:13] <+thedream_c> yeah it took me awhile to learn and appreciate both aspects when they get it right
[2:05:20] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @lonosis47 everyone make way for the sentai messiah
[2:05:22] <andre11dr> The wrong Virgin won
[2:05:24] <coreybom> @lonosis47 I have seen the differences, and while they are some that kinda bring em down, all and all they’re making a different show with a different atmosphere. Hell, they managed to make their own after a while, getting actors who can hold they’re own and such. Different isn’t always bad if its done right.
[2:05:31] <+ShinobiPhoenix> @menitta I didn't buy the Super Edition, I just have been buying the DLC packs. I am only missing a color skin
[2:05:33] <drefizz> Power bftg and Strive are my favorite fighting games out right now
[2:05:36] <Dave_VD> @lonosis47 Why not appreciate both? I credit watching power rangers as a kid as my first exposure to over-the-top anime type media, and it made me fall in love. Now I can just enjoy the nostalgia and the fact that this game is fun af
[2:05:48] <andre11dr> But really red ranger is the real Virgil
[2:05:53] <+thedream_c> like sentai gets it wrong too at times.
[2:05:53] <@Menitta> Yeah I just got the standard and the SF characters.
[2:06:04] <@Menitta> But this samurai character Woolie is playing is so cool
[2:06:13] <%Afterman_> @lonosis47 i think you probably need some form of therapy. please get help dude.
[2:06:14] <+shujojo> "I need more quantum power" they knew EXACTLY what they were doing
[2:06:15] <+Rada150> the possibility Hasbro still may have canceled their contract is in a sales report that showed a massive drop in Japan sentai sales due to a change overseas
[2:06:15] <@Menitta> Same with that stance guy
[2:06:16] <Shad0wTag> @thedream_c oh god remember Ninninger
[2:06:27] <+SanguineQuest> LETS GOOOOO MAGNA DEFENDER
[2:06:37] <+SanguineQuest> RIP
[2:06:38] <alphalejandro> Fight of the chunckers
[2:06:42] <Shad0wTag> @rada150 Sentai has been indecline for years sales wise and that is nit because of PR
[2:06:42] <%Prevot> @Shad0wTag say what now? cmonBruh
[2:06:47] <+ShinobiPhoenix> ShinkenRed Female is still the truth
[2:06:47] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1423196401152974850?s=19
[2:06:50] <dds333a> keep you on your toes LUL
[2:06:58] <Iwashi94> man the first sentai series I saw was ninninger and it felt super childish, even more than PR lol
[2:06:58] <DedlokPM> @lonosis47 Well you can talk to youself because you are foing on mute. Also I am hardly ignorant on the subject. I am just not a snobbish asshole who declares one thing to be the best and think all things that are not that to be trash. I actually acknowldge others have different opinions and tastes.
[2:07:00] <+thedream_c> @Shad0wTag man why are those 2010 sentais are the ones I'm seeing where it feels weird.
[2:07:03] <andre11dr> Woolie winning with the big boy
[2:07:11] <andre11dr> Or big girl
[2:07:15] <@Menitta> Yall need to chill here
[2:07:20] <Shad0wTag> @prevot Its the name of a Super Sentai season my guy. Search it. The PR version was called Ninja Steel
[2:07:20] <lonosis47> If Power rangers is what you grew up with then i feel bad for you LUL but that's fine if you admit its purely nostalgia factor. some people prefer Michael bay's transformers to the original source material *shrug* LUL
[2:07:35] <+Rada150> @Shad0wTag yeah but their Overseas had huge drop compared to the gradual decline of japan only sales, the only reason for that would be a change in distrubutor
[2:07:43] <Applecannon63> Sentai is not always perfect I mean look at how rough their viewership and toy sales
[2:07:46] <+SanguineQuest> Imagine not appreciating different things for different reasons and/or not just liking a thing without needing to shit on things you don't
[2:07:49] <dds333a> @lonosis47 true LUL
[2:07:56] <Shad0wTag> @thedream_c Honestly not all of them. Toqger is a treat
[2:08:12] <dds333a> I can't believe I've seen all of Bayformers crap
[2:08:13] <@Menitta> Power Rangers started in 2017 with the movie obviously
[2:08:36] <%ggbhtg> @Menitta Yep, totally getting a sequel to that movie ANY DAY NOW :)
[2:08:40] <andre11dr> I gave up at the third Bayformers
[2:09:05] <andre11dr> How many are there at this point like 13 or some shit?
[2:09:11] <enerkaizer> I'd honestly would love to see Zenkaiser here somehow as some sort of mokujin( swordmaster character, even though it seems very unlikely he'll become part of PR because his season is the definition of exotically weird
[2:09:13] <@Menitta> 5
[2:09:24] <coreybom> @lonosis47 Dude you are one of the most smuggest dudes i ever seen. Like, fuck, people can like stuff for none nostalgia factor, and you are coming across really as an well actually kinda guy.
[2:09:30] <+Rada150> Toqger will most likely never see an adaptation
[2:09:31] <dds333a> @andre11dr just five, Bumblebee somewhat adjacent
[2:09:36] <andre11dr> Wait just 5 ,they feel like way more
[2:09:37] <drefizz> those colors are sick
[2:09:41] <Shad0wTag> @enerkaizer Imagine the Super Zenkaiger dragon install
[2:09:44] <+thedream_c> @Rada150 yeah def that kinda series.
[2:09:45] <Sonicdy> Is woolie has the dlc?
[2:09:53] <dds333a> HONO
[2:09:54] <@Menitta> OH THATS COOL
[2:09:56] <+SanguineQuest> OOOOOOOOOOH
[2:09:56] <coreybom> @andre11dr 5 by Bay and a great Bumblebee Spin-Off/Reboot.
[2:09:58] <@Menitta> THAT IS SO FUCKING COOL
[2:10:02] <enerkaizer> @Shad0wTag That or the gattling would be wild
[2:10:03] <artificiallynatural> YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[2:10:04] <drefizz> screen tearing
[2:10:09] <%ggbhtg> Even with the insane screen tear, that was dope
[2:10:12] <%ggbhtg> kinda helped even
[2:10:13] <alphalejandro> Draw the kanji
[2:10:16] <+kevlarkoala> i legit love how this stage just looks like a set and not a place lol, it's amazing
[2:10:17] <+bustawof> thats vergil's lvl 3 Pog
[2:10:21] <DedlokPM> @Sonicdy Pretty sure most of these characters they are using now are dlc rooBlank
[2:10:26] <+thedream_c> mastadon sniper perd good too
[2:10:29] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> twitch does not like the fancy effect hoo boy
[2:10:30] <coreybom> God this game has such sick shit GOD DAMN.
[2:10:33] <%ggbhtg> WAIT SO THERE'S 4 VERGILS IN THIS GAME?! LUL
[2:10:38] <Shad0wTag> @enerkaizer Twokaizer complete with a super which is the dance sequence
[2:10:39] <+thedream_c> they can add more
[2:10:40] <+Rada150> @thedream_c you could make it work but unless the story is good it would probably be one of the lowest ranked seasons which is sad because it has an Orange sixth
[2:10:43] <enerkaizer> still can't get enough of the fact that sentai is legit using the wind-up gun from the starship troopers parody futurama once did
[2:10:46] <Shad0wTag> Yohohoi~
[2:10:50] <%ggbhtg> ARE THERE ANY MORE VERGILS I DON'T KNOW ABOUT?!
[2:10:54] <+SanguineQuest> @ggbhtg "Wait, its all Vergils?" "Always was..."
[2:10:57] <enerkaizer> @Shad0wTag Make the dance like dance ultra taunt xD"
[2:11:00] <Sonicdy> Is this power vergil? LUL
[2:11:03] <andre11dr> The black ranger has a gun ,i see what's happening here
[2:11:06] <+AurryVS> wait???
[2:11:10] <+thedream_c> i mean the battle designers were big on MVC3
[2:11:11] <+AurryVS> FOUR????
[2:11:16] <Applecannon63> @ggbhtg she kinda reminds me of hibiki with Yuzuriha
[2:11:32] <coreybom> @auriosvs Never enough vergils.
[2:11:39] <+Rada150> this game is tyhe true MVC infinate
[2:11:45] <+Rada150> infinite
[2:11:47] <Shad0wTag> @enerkaizer Twokaini Revolution
[2:11:59] <andre11dr> The lion dude looks insane tho
[2:12:15] <+AurryVS> I'm tryna think: Quantum, Red Samurai, Shadow and ???
[2:12:16] <+thedream_c> yeah Da Shi is pretty cool
[2:12:17] <+ShinobiPhoenix> I personally want Wolzard in the game, but I don't remember if there's if a comic reason for it, he is in Legacy Wars though
[2:12:26] <alphalejandro> Wolf vs Lion
[2:12:27] <+thedream_c> someone mentioned he plays simlarly to Black Panther from MVCI
[2:12:34] <+SanguineQuest> Dai Shi with that Wesker shit baybeeeee
[2:12:37] <+ShinobiPhoenix> and Udonna as the only Magiranger rep is meh
[2:12:37] <enerkaizer> @Shad0wTag or go buck wild by giving us masked Rider. Hasbro must have the "power rider" trademark saban got for decade, so there might be a chance they could use Black RX
[2:12:40] <%ggbhtg> We got 2 characters whose OG actors went on to have roles as Vergil, then we got 2 other characters that play like MvC3 Vergil
[2:12:46] <+Rada150> Dai Shi's moveset is based on black panther
[2:13:00] <+Rada150> it was confirmed
[2:13:07] <+Rada150> and RJ's is Sagat
[2:13:13] <Shad0wTag> @enerkaizer I don't have the mental fortitude to see Masked Rider here, it would depress me Ferbus and all
[2:13:16] <+thedream_c> Mask Rider jsut won't fly IMO. Just don't have that same brand power that MMPR has built up since the 90s in a good way
[2:13:21] <drefizz> RJ is a cooler sagat
[2:13:31] <+thedream_c> and Saban def don't wanan risk losing on EZ money
[2:13:36] <+ShinobiPhoenix> I would KILL for Black RX, but he's definitely not in Legacy Wars or Shattered Grid. I don't think he's shown up in Boom Comics
[2:13:37] <Shad0wTag> @thedream_c I would rather have Mystic Knights of Tir a Nog
[2:13:40] <enerkaizer> @Shad0wTag No need for forbus, just give us Black RX and call it a day xD" they wouldn't need to do more
[2:13:42] <@Menitta> I feel like this game could really use an air dash
[2:13:43] <drefizz> @thedream_c hasbro
[2:13:46] <Shad0wTag> REMEMBER CHAT
[2:13:55] <Applecannon63> @thedream_c such a bummer we had Kamen Rider Dragon Knight which I heard was decent adaptation
[2:13:56] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:13:57] <Shad0wTag> Mystic Knights of Tir a Nog
[2:13:58] <+AurryVS> @Rada150 he has a few things from P4A's Akihiko
[2:14:06] <$Superdandy96> I think Masked Rider could work. Though I also think it would work way better as a comic/Manga
[2:14:07] <Shad0wTag> @applecannon63 Its actuall not half bad
[2:14:12] <+SanguineQuest> Its sad that Kamen Rider has never taken off in the US, the crossovers with Power Rangers would be amazing
[2:14:13] <+thedream_c> @drefizz same difference. Old money don't wanna risk losing a small bucket of change in profits
[2:14:14] <+Deezyfesheezy> Deezyfesheezy subscribed with Prime. 
[2:14:19] <+Rada150> yeah but like 75-85% sagat
[2:14:33] <%ggbhtg> Reminder that Saban doesn't own PR anymore. Hasbro bought the whole franchise a couple years ago. Yes, THE WHOLE THING.
[2:14:50] <+Rada150> supposedly Kamen Rider Dragon knight did well, it didn;t have a good platform to take off
[2:14:51] <Shad0wTag> @sanguinequest Well now with Team Kamen Rider brand ans shout factory licencing the Zero One blu ray to come out in the US its a start
[2:14:52] <enerkaizer> Masked rider could've worked if they'd actually set it up right. Masked Rider and Dragon knight simply were both set up to fail one way or another.
[2:14:53] <%ggbhtg> Not just the rights, the whole house.
[2:14:54] <dds333a> Nice low there
[2:15:01] <alphalejandro> Go Reg
[2:15:11] <$Superdandy96> @ggbhtg correct me if I’m wrong but doesn’t Hasbro also have transformers and GIJoe too?
[2:15:14] <Sonicdy> I wished this has Crossover with kamen rider :(
[2:15:16] <Dave_VD> Damn those poses looked fucking sick at the end
[2:15:24] <%ggbhtg> @Superdandy96 they do
[2:15:27] <+ShinobiPhoenix> theorically, we could get Power Rangers in Nickelodeon All Stars
[2:15:29] <Shad0wTag> @enerkaizer Dragon Knight was more popular in JP that even dubbed it an official AR worls
[2:15:33] <Shad0wTag> *world
[2:15:35] <SvenHolgersson> GET MY MAN GOLDAR IN THERE
[2:15:41] <Shad0wTag> @superdandy96 yes
[2:15:44] <drefizz> oh no
[2:15:44] <+Rada150> Harsbro owns, Transformers, G.I.JOE, Micronauts,and some other 80's cartoon IP's
[2:15:45] <andre11dr> Damn why are the voices mixed so low
[2:15:46] <Qsmash_> Masked Rider's intro caused it to fail and I will believe that until the day I die
[2:15:46] <+thedream_c> @enerkaizer you are def right. But these kind of shows you have to set up like a reliable brand. MMPR endured. The other metal hero attempts did not
[2:15:48] <drefizz> 2 gohans
[2:16:04] <Shad0wTag> @qsmash_ and NOT Ferbus?
[2:16:06] <enerkaizer> @Shad0wTag not really, the toys were absolute shelf warmers, meaning the show was financially a failure. ratings alone donÄt decide a shows success sadly
[2:16:14] <+thedream_c> like I grew up being able to watch space sherriff shaider. Sadly the west got to watch VR troopers instad :p
[2:16:14] <+ShinobiPhoenix> freaking Turtles got in Nick All Stars so PR is on the table
[2:16:21] <Qsmash_> @Shad0wTag that too
[2:16:25] <artificiallynatural> isn't that an otg also?
[2:16:31] <coreybom> @lonosis47 Oh for fuck sakes shut up. Hell, you say they would fucked it up, yet they did a really good guyver film, Dark Hero, and i believe they did a great series of another sentai show in the US as well.
[2:16:38] <enerkaizer> Beetleborgs actualyl wozld've endured if saban woulndn't have run out of metalhero footage. sales and ratings were there
[2:16:39] <+Rada150> fun fact Transformers and G.I.JOE were published by marvel in the 80's and Marvel just gave up on them
[2:16:40] <%Deezyfesheezy> I get that it's Sentai in the east but do they play this game over there?
[2:16:53] <drefizz> oi chat chill out with the sentai vs PR
[2:16:54] <dds333a> @deezyfesheezy they can't
[2:17:04] <+thedream_c> @Deezyfesheezy i hear low key the JP players do
[2:17:07] <+SanguineQuest> Superhuman Samurai Cyber Squad comeback when?
[2:17:08] <Shad0wTag> @enerkaizer Are you talking about Dragon Knight?
[2:17:08] <+kevlarkoala> @Rada150 I still don't understand how neither of those games have a battle royale in this era
[2:17:13] <dds333a> Not legally obviously
[2:17:17] <Shad0wTag> @deezyfesheezy It can't be sold there
[2:17:17] <+SanguineQuest> Not that I don't love the Gridman animes mind you, they own
[2:17:19] <+kevlarkoala> neither of those properties*
[2:17:22] <Chichen> SAMURAI FIRE
[2:17:22] <+thedream_c> @Deezyfesheezy but they have to purchease the game via different means
[2:17:31] <blue6sub6remnant6> Chat, I have to out myself as an ignorant weeb. I can see they have a Red Samurai Lady Power Ranger, so I gotta ask, how did Power Rangers Samurai(?) handle the later plotline in Shinkenger that, without spoilers, got us a lady red ranger in addition to the guy who starts out as red?
[2:17:32] <enerkaizer> @Shad0wTag jup. Both the game as well as the toys were commercial failures
[2:17:33] <+Rada150> @Deezyfesheezy yes but they have to order it from the west there are no distributors of this game in japan
[2:17:37] <+ShinobiPhoenix> @sanguinequest Well do the dub that New Gridman anime?
[2:17:47] <+kevlarkoala> in fact, was the last "good" Transformers game the Platinum one, or has there been one since then?
[2:17:50] <dds333a> just import, actually. so totally legal
[2:17:55] <+ShinobiPhoenix> they do in fact call it Gridman SSS
[2:17:58] <+thedream_c> @blue6sub6remnant6 read up the Shinkenger show lore.
[2:18:01] <coreybom> @rada150 Funny thing about that, when it came to reproducing the comics, IDW had to cut out the issue that Spidey appeared in, along with sadly blacking him out on the cover.
[2:18:03] <%Deezyfesheezy> dang that sucks, is it impossible to just rebrand the game as a Sentai one, cuz that's dissapointing
[2:18:11] <dds333a> @kevlarkoala seems like
[2:18:15] <%Deezyfesheezy> like that's free money
[2:18:15] <Shad0wTag> @sanguinequest already acknoloweged in Gridman
[2:18:20] <coreybom> Good job mods SeemsGood
[2:18:25] <+ShinobiPhoenix> Superhuman Samurai Sybersquad would be SSS
[2:18:26] <blue6sub6remnant6> @thedream_c I know what happened in Shinkenger, but how did PR adapt that? It's so Japanese.
[2:18:28] <drefizz> thank you Menitta
[2:18:32] <+thedream_c> @blue6sub6remnant6 oh u mean how PR got the girl first as red. I mean... you can dice sentai footage however you want
[2:18:39] <+kevlarkoala> @dds333a what a shame. it wasn't the deepest game but it was definitely enjoyable
[2:18:53] <%SirGO0SE> chun looks great in this costume
[2:18:53] <Shad0wTag> @enerkaizer I wasn't referring to commercial success my bad I just meant fan reception in JP they liked Dragon Knight
[2:19:00] <+thedream_c> @blue6sub6remnant6 like how MMPR was a combo of zyuranger and other ranger show stuff
[2:19:04] <Dave_VD> @lonosis47 Bro you're killing the good vibes. Just cut your losses please
[2:19:13] <+thedream_c> just mute that one dude
[2:19:16] <+Rada150> Comic publications of IP are tricky especially when it is done for a 3rd party for example, He-Man and Thundercats comics were done by DC but they don't really own the rights
[2:19:20] <+AngriestAngryArtist> captain corridor!
[2:19:23] <%ggbhtg> @blue6sub6remnant6 For as much as power rangers doesn't normally try to do an English adaptation of a Sentai season, PR Samurai WAS just Shinkenger but in English. So the secret sibling storyline remained the same.
[2:19:25] <+thedream_c> don't bother replying to that cheese goblin at all
[2:19:31] <Shad0wTag> @blue6sub6remnant6 they followed it exactly and whitewashed it the entire way
[2:19:33] <@Menitta> I tried Kamen Rider several times and it just doesnt seem like my thing.
[2:19:39] <drefizz> I want the dino thunder Red ranger with his battleizer as a dragon install or the dino blue with his armor stuff
[2:19:49] <enerkaizer> @Shad0wTag ah, okay.but again, reception si one thing, financiall success another. bandai didn't get anything out of DK financially, hence why the franchise just fizzled
[2:19:50] <%Sparkseid> yo that was sic
[2:19:53] <@Menitta> Both Ex Aid and the fruit one
[2:19:54] <FlowLethal> Isnt fire girl ranger team didn’t want as leader
[2:19:56] <drefizz> dino thunder blue*
[2:20:02] <+ShinobiPhoenix> @rada150 right, like Godzilla and Marvel, or GI Joe and Transformers and Marcel
[2:20:04] <$Superdandy96> @menitta I get you, took me forever to get into Ultraman until I finally got int through Z
[2:20:08] <coreybom> @rada150 And sadly is the rights expire, we can lose out on some REALLY great stuff.
[2:20:11] <+SanguineQuest> Dino Thunder WHite Ranger has the best design though
[2:20:11] <+thedream_c> @Menitta i can see that. But sometimes you have to start with a 'good' KR show to get your feet wet. YOu may have to find it. We have 3 decades of it :)
[2:20:20] <Dave_VD> @drefizz That would be tight. They need a dino thunder rep for sure
[2:20:22] <Shad0wTag> @menitta Thats alright man. What seasons did you try?
[2:20:26] <+Rada150> @drefizz if they get any dino thunder it will be most likely White ranger or mesogog
[2:20:37] <Nocturnment> Dino Thunder Red with his spaghetti arms
[2:20:44] <enerkaizer> Having a Dino-based KR now feels so weird after dinosaurs have pretty much become Sentai/ PRs bread and butter
[2:20:49] <drefizz> @Rada150 but red and his stretchy arms man
[2:20:51] <pablov921> boy, I love this game
[2:20:57] <$Superdandy96> @rada150 Oooo, that’s true! Mesogog could be a fun choice
[2:20:58] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:21:03] <+ShinobiPhoenix> I would want GokaiSilver just to have his Gold Form
[2:21:03] <@Menitta> I got the farthest into Ex Aid
[2:21:09] <DedlokPM> I like how Ionosis is all like "I am here to spread the word that Sentai is better" but all they are doing is making it seem the opposite because they are bing so obnoxious. This is solele based on the stuff from before I put them on ignore mind you.
[2:21:13] <Pookiedaexzile> Real Gs wanna see Pyscho Rangers in this
[2:21:14] <+thedream_c> Dino based KR show huh? yeah taht sounds weird when its a sentai motif but I get it
[2:21:22] <drefizz> stretchy arms and extendo lengs
[2:21:23] <Shad0wTag> @menitta Best advice to try a season, look a few suits from the show and a plot synopsis and go from there
[2:21:25] <drefizz> legs*
[2:21:35] <%ggbhtg> @Menitta Now the thing about Kamen Rider I've come to learn, is that the early 2000s season are closer to a J-Drama in seriousness, and along the way, the "2nd half of the Heisei Era" is more comedic/less serious, if that helps.
[2:21:42] <+thedream_c> but with KR shows, i'm always sold on how HOT the henshin scene is
[2:21:44] <@Menitta> I hear OOOs and Kabuto are two good ones to stsrt with
[2:21:47] <%ggbhtg> 2000s seasons *
[2:21:47] <Shad0wTag> @thedream_c well the gimmick is the two in 1 rider but the opposite of what we had with W
[2:21:55] <+thedream_c> which is why I have a soft spot for FAIZ due to their henshins
[2:21:59] <enerkaizer> One character who'd be sick as dlc would be the red command ranger from the IDW comics of power rangers spd.
[2:22:02] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @Menitta I think even Pat recommended them
[2:22:02] <%SpaghettiTime44> wait, is that just chun-li?
[2:22:04] <+ShinobiPhoenix> I admittedly haven't watched Kamen Rider since not finishing Wizard, but I always hear ZiO is legit
[2:22:09] <Applecannon63> @dedlokpm shitty guys like these is the reason why the toku community is a trashfire
[2:22:10] <+thedream_c> @Shad0wTag LMAO. with USB drives?
[2:22:13] <+Axle13j> I feel like I haven't heard Laura Bailey in ages
[2:22:15] <coreybom> @dedlokpm They really are just acting like an IRL comic boom guy from the simpsons.
[2:22:17] <Shad0wTag> @menitta OOO's personally is a good idea. Kabuto has a cool suit but its story is all over the place
[2:22:27] <@Menitta> Oh and Double
[2:22:31] <@Menitta> Double is also recommended
[2:22:33] <+thedream_c> Kabuto has kooky chars and effects.
[2:22:33] <Shad0wTag> @thedream_c Nah we got stamps this time the digital kind
[2:22:37] <$Superdandy96> @thedream_c I got sold to watch Faiz because of the suit. It looks really good to me
[2:22:37] <enerkaizer> @ShinobiPhoenix nah, Zi-Oh, was terrible. zero1 though was great
[2:22:38] <+Axle13j> @SpaghettiTime44 that is literally just chun li lol Ryu is in too
[2:22:39] <+thedream_c> HAHAH stamps
[2:22:41] <FlowLethal> Merrick should be playable
[2:22:52] <+Rada150> @drefizz red dino thunder onbly has stretchy arms as a battlizer which requires new modelling , most of these characters have alot of their assets taking from the mobile game, which the battlizer does not
[2:23:05] <Shad0wTag> @menitta W is super safe. Formulaic but super good
[2:23:19] <blue6sub6remnant6> Is it a hot take to say Fourze is accessible for a kamen rider show? 🤔
[2:23:25] <+ShinobiPhoenix> to be fair, the Battle for the Grid Twitter is mostly people hating on Sentai, so it's both sides
[2:23:29] <Nocturnment> I think there's a Twitter account that posts sentai gifs, I use that to decide which shows to watch
[2:23:32] <Shad0wTag> @enerkaizer I'll rematch Grand Zi-O henshin everytime however
[2:23:37] <$Superdandy96> @shad0wtag plus who doesn’t enjoy a good noir mystery?
[2:23:38] <dds333a> @blue6sub6remnant6 I do NOT know what to say to this
[2:23:40] <+ShinobiPhoenix> mostly always Western Fans
[2:24:05] <Shad0wTag> @superdandy96 Faiz is like a j-drama love triangle story with tech and henshin
[2:24:07] <$Superdandy96> @blue6sub6remnant6 oh heck yeah. Fourze is all about good vibes!
[2:24:09] <+ShinobiPhoenix> @nocturnment I think I follow that account too!
[2:24:10] <%ggbhtg> @Menitta Essentially, if you want a more serious season, watch Decade and the seasons before Decade, and for less serious, watch seasons after it, which start at W. Either, KR is mainly a young adult / kid audience.
[2:24:20] <Shad0wTag> @blue6sub6remnant6 Nah
[2:24:21] <%ggbhtg> *Either way
[2:24:28] <+Rada150> hey a DEV for the game challenged Japanese players to a tournament, the problem was again Japan doesn't have big distribution of the game
[2:24:31] <Super_Voltekka> RyuChamp RyuChamp RyuChamp RyuChamp RyuChamp RyuChamp RyuChamp
[2:24:32] <+ShinobiPhoenix> @shad0wtag I LOVED 555
[2:24:35] <+thedream_c> Decade is a anniversary series AND has the budget
[2:24:37] <+thedream_c> so that is fun
[2:24:48] <Sonicdy> RyuChamp
[2:24:53] <+thedream_c> in fact the 2000s anniversary ones with budget is FUN for effects alone
[2:24:55] <Shad0wTag> @superdandy96 I mean Accel is already like one the best secondary riders ever
[2:24:56] <DedlokPM> RyuChamp
[2:25:18] <%Deezyfesheezy> really wish everyone had their non transformed skins
[2:25:26] <@Menitta> Yeah thats just it, I think it's tough to be into KR if you didn't already grow up on tokusatsu stuff like that. Like I can watch modern Pokemon no problem but it's firmly for kids and thats undeniable.
[2:25:29] <Shad0wTag> @shinobiphoenix Its on my list next alongside Blade
[2:25:35] <dds333a> LUL
[2:25:35] <FlowLethal> The best rider was magical girl beast
[2:25:46] <+ShinobiPhoenix> Den-O is only half serious because it's a comedy show, but it's great and my first Kamen Rider
[2:25:54] <+thedream_c> you also watch Decade as a fan show (being you have some knoweldfge of the 2000s shows) and the kooky cast
[2:25:58] <+Rada150> well Goldar got a King Sphinx skin in he mobile game recently maybe we will see that in this game
[2:26:03] <$Superdandy96> @shad0wtag I actually didn’t like accel at first, but his growth really made me like him.
[2:26:13] <+ShinobiPhoenix> Kiva started on my birthday, and I loved Kiva
[2:26:25] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Akibaranger is clearly the bset
[2:26:27] <Pookiedaexzile> Black Ranger has a fucking gun
[2:26:32] <FlowLethal> Kiva was twilight ?
[2:26:34] <Shad0wTag> @menitta You nailed it there. I can sorta turn off my sense of disbelief and just buy into what I'm watching. Sometimes there's an actual good plot, others time I can tell I'm being sold a toy
[2:26:35] <+Axle13j> lolol
[2:26:35] <+ShinobiPhoenix> the whole Heisei Rider Era is just great except Ryuga
[2:26:37] <drefizz> broke ryu's neck
[2:26:42] <Applecannon63> @shinobiphoenix the western fans of the toku community are yikes cause they're make homphobic/transphobic shit especially with KR Zero One's actor
[2:26:49] <+ShinobiPhoenix> I mean Ryuki
[2:27:12] <%ggbhtg> @Menitta Sounds like you want something more mature....which would mean to start at Kuuga, the modern/2000s revival of the series, then go from there. Or heck, go back to the OG OG stuff, the Showa era. Check out KR Black then the sequel Black RX.
[2:27:20] <Shad0wTag> @superdandy96 he went from "DON'T ASK ME QUESTIONS WOMAN" to "My wife told me I gotta come home and put my daughter to bed"
[2:27:23] <+thedream_c> Kiva has a strong cast too. Predominantly due to Otoya
[2:27:33] <+ShinobiPhoenix> @applecannon63 I am out of the loop since Wizard, is the Zero 1 actor LGBT?
[2:27:35] <Shad0wTag> @shinobiphoenix You mean Ryuki?
[2:27:36] <drefizz> we need Ryuga from Beyblade in this game since Hasbro owns PR now
[2:27:43] <$Superdandy96> @shinobiphoenix lol, I found myself like Ryuki. Costumes were a bit on the meh side for me. But I really like the overall story
[2:27:51] <%ggbhtg> @Menitta Sentai and KR in the 70s didn't fuck around, even though it was still aimed at kid audiences.
[2:27:57] <+thedream_c> Ryuki is fun for what it is. Peple will hype it up to ohard but its up to you to figure out if its your jam.
[2:27:58] <+ShinobiPhoenix> @shad0wtag Yeah, I wrote Ryuki after
[2:27:58] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:28:02] <andre11dr> Man chat looking alien language to me
[2:28:17] <Pookiedaexzile> Its English
[2:28:21] <+ShinobiPhoenix> 555 after Ryuki is like Obama after Bush
[2:28:24] <Applecannon63> @shinobiphoenix Zero One's actor for Naki is Non-binary
[2:28:27] <enerkaizer> Toku got awa with a lot of crap because japans age rating agencys didn't give a single F about violence until the 90ies
[2:28:29] <drefizz> @andre11dr shmebo, lableebo?
[2:28:47] <%ggbhtg> @andre11dr I'm sorry, there's a LOT of hella Japnese Engrish titles being thrown around LUL
[2:28:52] <+ShinobiPhoenix> @applecannon63 is that all? and people are being stupid about that? humans were a mistake
[2:29:07] <Shad0wTag> @applecannon63 The actor isn't non-binary she just dresses that way as she thinks it cool. her character is though
[2:29:18] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> bogos binted?
[2:29:18] <ladylunarphoenix> @andre11dr I know the feeling, I was lost a lot to when I started following a few members of the Fighting game community. You'll catch on!
[2:29:20] <%ggbhtg> @andre11dr I'm not saying this stuff is anime.......but it's kinda anime in here

[2:30:36] <%livlinn> woolieKICKDAD joofbBless
[2:30:37] <+Axle13j> I cast GUN
[2:30:39] <Mach5Mike> Ryu had to take a bullet for that win
[2:30:39] <drefizz> Your hadouken can't beat my gun!
[2:30:56] <+ShinobiPhoenix> I would totally accept the Fangire taking over earth, humans were a mistake
[2:30:57] <ladylunarphoenix> @andre11dr oooh yeah (nods)
[2:31:03] <Shad0wTag> @andre11dr Apologies man if we are confusing you. I don't have any friends that like this stuff so this like my only form of release to talk about it
[2:31:11] <andre11dr> Nah it's fine
[2:31:18] <+ShinobiPhoenix> not to mention, 555 makes it clear humans are a problem too
[2:31:20] <ThatDamnTyrant> Shinku GUN!
[2:31:20] <andre11dr> I respect the pasion
[2:31:28] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @Shad0wTag
[2:31:36] <MysteryFish_> Oh hey it looks like HorizonOnFire is doing okay in the latest fighting game :)
[2:31:40] <%ggbhtg> Moobot, plz
[2:31:43] <Shad0wTag> damn it that wasn't a link ech
[2:31:50] <MysteryFish_> Goldarr or bust
[2:31:53] <+ShinobiPhoenix> if you want a show that make you hate people, that show is 555,so many people do horrible things to good people for no reason
[2:32:08] <Shad0wTag> Metsuboujinrai(dot)net were right
[2:32:11] <andre11dr> If this was mecha shit i know i would probably be sounding like an alien too LUL
[2:32:17] <$Superdandy96> @shinobiphoenix the secondary rider is a shit. Love to hate him
[2:32:24] <%ggbhtg> Think about it, Woolz and Reg are playing a video game, based on a English interpretation of a Japanese franchise, and the game itself is primarily referencing the modern English comic book adaptation. There's a lot of crossed wires here. LUL
[2:32:26] <Dave_VD> You can tell they're having a blast with this
[2:32:41] <@Menitta> Twitch is weird with periods. It'll take random things as links and others not
[2:32:50] <Shad0wTag> @superdandy96 Everyone loves to hate Kaixa, that man couldn t even get an upgrade form let alone a final form
[2:32:51] <blue6sub6remnant6> @andre11dr Remember, in England, *everything* is a Transformer.
[2:32:56] <$Superdandy96> The MAHVEL gameplay really helps lol
[2:33:04] <+thedream_c> meaning it is a great fighting game IP to work off on
[2:33:08] <MysteryFish_> @andre11dr i'm in this message and i hate it
[2:33:11] <+ShinobiPhoenix> @super_voltekka oh he's absolutely a Vergil. and don't think I don't see your Tekkaman Blade name!
[2:33:14] <+thedream_c> loads of chars, crossed wired lore, but good fighting all around
[2:33:34] <+ShinobiPhoenix> Tekkaman Blade is basically a Kamen Rider
[2:33:48] <FlowLethal> I wonder when marvel 4 is coming out
[2:33:56] <MysteryFish_> @ShinobiPhoenix Space Pirate Tekkaman Blade is space kamen outlaws brionyTap
[2:33:56] <+thedream_c> but yeah i'm glad this game came out. It covers a strong niche and the players love it
[2:34:09] <Shad0wTag> Man I'm glad this place is so chill with toku to talk about it as every other corner of the internet is a nightmare
[2:34:10] <+thedream_c> i'm waiting on Melty Lumina for my shmoovement tho
[2:34:10] <@Menitta> Its a perfect MVC lite game
[2:34:10] <%JeoDood> i mean the new riders villains twitter was having a field day trying to defend mexico honor saying it is racist's from texas  but the actually Mexicans are are ok with it
[2:34:15] <DedlokPM> @FlowLethal rooSuffer pixcatPain bugifSuffer
[2:34:19] <%ggbhtg> If that wasn't enough crossed wires, THE GAME is just Marvel 3, which is already a combination of English and Japan franchises.....a lot of crossed wires, but still running a super computer
[2:34:20] <%livlinn> !uptime
[2:34:21] <@Moobot> @livlinn WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 34 minutes
[2:34:22] <@Menitta> its a hyper fighter easy to pick up
[2:34:23] <MysteryFish_> @ShinobiPhoenix also the crimson glow valstrax armour in MH Rise
[2:34:39] <%Heefnoff> Ehhhh it’s not exactly Marvel 3 but it’s pretty damn close
[2:34:44] <+ShinobiPhoenix> a lot of people are clearly Kämen Risers
[2:34:48] <%Heefnoff> More grounded Marvel is fairly accurate
[2:35:00] <+Axle13j> this game is awesome
[2:35:00] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1423196401152974850?s=19

[2:39:15] <dds333a> I'm good at kof '02, especially OG, but I've gotten slaughtered by some dudes, fun times
[2:39:15] <@Menitta> Is Maguma gonna come in here and soft lock the cab LUL
[2:39:16] <RAH001> Mvc was my first on PlayStation. After trying for weeks to get a scratched up disc to work as a wee lad
[2:39:16] <andre11dr> Haiato is really bad
[2:39:24] <Solidnick18> RyuChamp
[2:39:28] <+thedream_c> the cool part about marvel 2's top tier moutnain is the different facets of it
[2:39:33] <andre11dr> He just dosen't combo for some reason
[2:39:46] <+ShinobiPhoenix> starting with X-men COTA all the way to Marvel vsC2
[2:39:48] <%SirGO0SE> I played at china town fair and got my clock cleaned LUL
[2:39:52] <+thedream_c> MSP gets beat by Iron man ROM. Then other teams can try beat Iron Man teams. Then MSP tries her luck against those rogues.
[2:40:01] <+thedream_c> oh yeah the CP lore
[2:40:04] <dds333a> welp
[2:40:06] <%ggbhtg> Sadly, I missed out on MvC3 as well
[2:40:13] <+thedream_c> NO REFUNDS in MVC2 CP
[2:40:13] <andre11dr> You'll still get exposed
[2:40:16] <+Axle13j> It'll be GREAT
[2:40:18] <Solidnick18> that's fine
[2:40:19] <%ggbhtg> I don't really have a 2d fighter to play
[2:40:22] <+ShinobiPhoenix> whenever a super move happens in any fighting game now, I still scream "INFINITY"
[2:40:24] <Super_Voltekka> SOMEBODY CALL YIPES
[2:40:25] <+thedream_c> I mean CF not CP
[2:40:34] <+SanguineQuest> I still have MVC2 downloaded on my xbox 360
[2:40:34] <+thedream_c> as in CHinatown Fair
[2:40:39] <Solidnick18> not everybody is great at everything
[2:40:39] <dds333a> @ggbhtg I'm way more adept at mvc3, myself way more than 2
[2:40:43] <alphalejandro> Disney just doesn't care
[2:40:44] <%TubeMan642> Just don't BB Hood vs Venom
[2:40:50] <+thedream_c> you need a modded dreamcast
[2:40:54] <Super_Voltekka> FUCK COPYRIGHT LAWS
[2:41:02] <+thedream_c> its the best way to enjoy outside of a cab since the Naomi version is the one people champion
[2:41:15] <%SirGO0SE> the second someone picks Magneto Storm Sentinel im out
[2:41:15] <@Menitta> I tried getting bootleg netplay happening during the peak pandemic and it was utterly impossible.
[2:41:15] <Shad0wTag> The HD version had first gen rollback
[2:41:19] <dds333a> the channels
[2:41:26] <@Menitta> The game just cannot work now
[2:41:27] <dds333a> LUL
[2:41:33] <mike2hands> LUL LUL LUL
[2:41:34] <+ShinobiPhoenix> @super_voltekka yiu mean Trademark laws
[2:41:37] <%ggbhtg> Yeah Xbox and PS2 ports were wack, but then the 360 / PS3 ports were solid AF
[2:41:38] <+FuqBoiSlim> WHO-neto?!
[2:41:40] <+Axle13j> LES HIT SOME BUTTONS
[2:41:53] <Afrosamasenpai> MASH THEM BUTTONS
[2:41:54] <+ShinobiPhoenix> it's all about licensing
[2:41:56] <dds333a> which sucks, because Dormammu in 3 was an INSPIRED choice
[2:41:57] <@Solidus_113> you hit that light punch
[2:42:02] <andre11dr> I somehow by chance maind a really annoying team from the start, Blackhart ,Cable , Comando LUL
[2:42:03] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:42:07] <@Menitta> LIGHT PUNCH
[2:42:10] <+thedream_c> mvc2 casually? OH YEAH
[2:42:13] <+FuqBoiSlim> MEDIUM PUNCH
[2:42:19] <Afrosamasenpai> LIGHT KICK
[2:42:21] <@Solidus_113> start with up heavy kick
[2:42:21] <$Superdandy96> Dang, I got to get going. Take care everyone #SaveMVC2
[2:42:25] <+FuqBoiSlim> HEAVY PUNCH
[2:42:26] <%ggbhtg> That's pretty true, I think that's WHY the Ratio System they recently made is so valid @WoolieVersus
[2:42:27] <+thedream_c> you can use mid tiers too
[2:42:28] <+SanguineQuest> MVC2 Casually is arguably more fun because you can actually play most of the roster that way XD
[2:42:31] <@Menitta> I literally have never played it and I want this to happen
[2:42:36] <teddygrahams82> the baby
[2:42:38] <blue6sub6remnant6> "Who are these X-who?" - Paul Marketing. NotLikeThis
[2:42:39] <@Menitta> I want to play this game
[2:42:41] <andre11dr> At least try to do a Canle loop
[2:42:45] <+thedream_c> SIM in MVC2 is supposedly execution LORDS tier
[2:42:47] <+ShinobiPhoenix> I should know now that I am working in Game Development and have to look at the laws that protect my stuff, so I see both sides now. I am very new to it though
[2:42:50] <@Solidus_113> I still have my copy digitally on 360
[2:42:56] <@Solidus_113> but no live gold
[2:42:58] <Super_Voltekka> Does the Chris G bullet hell technique translate well to Marvel 2?
[2:43:08] <%SirGO0SE> like fantasy football?
[2:43:09] <%ggbhtg> Literally Free Ratio System Reggie
[2:43:09] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[2:43:17] <+thedream_c> @Super_Voltekka different game. Different skillsets.
[2:43:20] <Dave_VD> It's a cool system
[2:43:23] <%ggbhtg> who cares, it's the Ratio System
[2:43:25] <BackflipCharm> Marvel is a fantastic casual game. Always has been
[2:43:26] <alphalejandro> In fact, the comic book industry is so bad as today in terms of business and money that Marvel profit come more from the movies and series than from the comics
[2:43:27] <andre11dr> @super_voltekka No Morigan is trash in this game
[2:43:28] <%SirGO0SE> Fighting games with a Salary
[2:43:30] <+Damie904> @Super_Voltekka Thats MVC3 Morrigan specific. Dont think any other game allows or has a character that can do that
[2:43:31] <%SirGO0SE> Cap
[2:43:38] <+ShinobiPhoenix> it is STUPID because no one can forsee licensing going beyond a certain point in time or being on a different medium they didn't consider
[2:43:40] <+thedream_c> MVC2 isn't really about bullet hell
[2:43:45] <+FuqBoiSlim> ratio ratio youngboy better
[2:43:46] <Applecannon63> Like Capcom vs Snk?
[2:43:49] <%ggbhtg> oh right, CvS2 says Free Ratio
[2:43:54] <%ggbhtg> Cvs1 is set Ratio
[2:43:54] <teddygrahams82> RyuChamp
[2:44:08] <+thedream_c> mvc2 got unblockables too so regardless if you arne't shmoovin to defnd that, you are getting opened
[2:44:15] <+ShinobiPhoenix> it's what the Black Widow lawsuit is about

[2:46:04] <+thedream_c> crossover
[2:46:06] <@Menitta> @thedream_c I think that's what I tried setting up. It got to the point where we were in the same game and inputs were being shared but there was a desync so while I'd be getting combo'd on his screen, I'd see just pressing buttons

[2:53:37] <BlackermanZX> whens Sevbot
[2:53:43] <+ShinobiPhoenix> so Reggie doesn't use Magneto in Marvel 3 either then...
[2:53:56] <+thedream_c> the lack of shmoovmeent
[2:53:59] <+thedream_c> in reggie's team
[2:54:01] <shaddydaddyo> you want to learn how to do an infinite?
[2:54:05] <+ShinobiPhoenix> give me some Marrow love
[2:54:08] <colosin33> Some Power Rangers seasons still manage to impress me though the feeling may not really last for long. It's just that I do have my personal preferences and I prefer Super Sentai over Power Rangers for most of the time
[2:54:11] <dds333a> @shinobiphoenix just not well LUL
[2:54:11] <andre11dr> Honestly it's not as bad as i thought it would be, at least Reggie is doing SOME triangle jumps

[2:55:41] <%ggbhtg> @colosin33 It's not an unheard of opinion to have. When you compare the writing of Power Rangers to other kids cartoons, it feels like PR was/is stuck in the 80s/90s. It wasn't until the literal most recent season, Dino Fury, that it felt like a show meant for modern audiences.

[2:57:28] <Shad0wTag> @sanguinequest it could be worse could be a former melee player and have fucked up hands from years of busted gc controller use and crt tv staring

[2:57:41] <+thedream_c> yeah MVC2 has always been the game that is all about 'by any means necessary'
[2:57:55] <BackflipCharm> @Maximilian_DOOD I had to pass out before you finished stream the other night. did you manage to get it consistently?
[2:57:55] <%TheBesteban> Chuck them grenades
[2:58:02] <+TheGershon> just got here, are they playing on Dreamcast?
[2:58:07] <dds333a> right through
[2:58:13] <@Maximilian_DOOD> not on midsized characters @BackflipCharm
[2:58:18] <+thedream_c> funny people say you may be too old to play mvc2. But peep the people who are putting mad hours on this game. They aren't in your 20s :p
[2:58:25] <%ggbhtg> dang, that reminds me how Raizo and Gan on Rival Schools can be infinited, but NOBODY else
[2:58:33] <+SanguineQuest> @Shad0wTag lol, true. Just remember the Prophet Pat's words, that one day there will be no more special broken cheater controllers or CT tvs, and we will be free from Melee forever
[2:58:44] <BackflipCharm> Damn that must be some tight timing. Marvel folks are crazy.
[2:58:44] <+ShinobiPhoenix> @thegershon Emulator or something because it's Arcade
[2:58:51] <+thedream_c> Give it another decade and your primary MVC2 players are close to their 40s
[2:58:54] <+Axle13j> AND HERE COMES THE GIANT FIST
[2:58:59] <dds333a> @thedream_c to be fair, they aren't THAT old LUL
[2:58:59] <+vitoxxi> is this fightcade?
[2:59:14] <+thedream_c> could be DC emu (unstable sorta) or modded DC
[2:59:21] <andre11dr> Timer scam ?
[2:59:21] <Shad0wTag> @sanguinequest I believe its already getting harder to get the 'optimal' broken gc controler already. And as for CRT's those will literally die any day now
[2:59:29] <+thedream_c> modded DC is a beautiful version tho.

[2:59:32] <@Menitta> its a SUPER LEGIT DREAMCAST
[2:59:38] <dds333a> @thedream_c but, yeah, I was gonna mention that they'll ble closer to middle age
[2:59:42] <+TheGershon> oh that menu looked like, uh, redream I think?
[2:59:48] <+UberWolfman> A LEGIT ARCADE MACHINE CHAT Kappa
[2:59:50] <Thrawnmich> It's nice to see Luke from Street Fighter here in MvC2 Kappa LUL
[2:59:58] <dds333a> Like a good bit of us, I assume
[2:59:59] <blackkanye> Is this dreamcast "LEGALLY OBTAINED"?
[3:00:01] <%ggbhtg> Rather, Gan and Raizo have jump - land - rejump infinites on them, and only on them. There's a couple other infinities in RS1
[3:00:04] <@Menitta> I love Magneto's idle animation
[3:00:06] <Shad0wTag> @menitta Man I can't wait for Woolie to show of his super dreamcast on twitter!
[3:00:21] <%ggbhtg> Heck, Gan has a standing infinite on EVERYONE
[3:00:25] <+TheGershon> I wanna be that guy who reminds everyone that emulators are totally legal, it's pirating the games that isn't
[3:00:28] <gruulmagebeast> i like how whenever i see Marvel vs Capcom.... under someone in the follow list i have to ask the question, "2 or Infinite?"
[3:00:36] <Shad0wTag> @blackkanye all dreamcasts are legal in spirit
[3:00:49] <Shad0wTag> @thegershon tell that to nintendo
[3:00:53] <+thedream_c> well depending on which tech, emulators may not be the best experience either.
[3:00:57] <gruulmagebeast> who is on what side?
[3:01:04] <Super_Voltekka> SERVBOTS ONLY, FINAL DESTINATION
[3:01:04] <+UberWolfman> DC controllers are illegal lytFILTH They hurt my hands
[3:01:14] <+thedream_c> tho mIster is coming closer for some games and I'm happy for it
[3:01:21] <+thedream_c> mist3r I mean
[3:01:21] <dds333a> Woolz is left, Reg riggt
[3:01:22] <+TheGershon> @shad0wtag they don't shut down emulators, they shut down from sites

[3:01:44] <%JustToWatch> that thing Max has that is the actual Dreamcast hardware that emulates the game is legit such a clever idea

[3:01:59] <Shad0wTag> @thegershon you don't need to defend Nintendo here man
[3:02:01] <+thedream_c> thy mod dreamcasts now too
[3:02:04] <gruulmagebeast> yo they got that juggernaut glitch down?
[3:02:09] <%ggbhtg> All my dreamcast games are RIGHT over there, off screen :) ---->
[3:02:20] <%ggbhtg> therefore I can use ROMs :)
[3:02:31] <@Menitta> It really frustrates me that i couldnt even get this game working with emulation.
[3:02:32] <dds333a> @justtowatch that's how it's done. got it going for my Wii and Ps3
[3:02:36] <stukamod> MrDestructoid ROCKET PUNCH
[3:02:45] <andre11dr> I think Woolie knows about the buff glitch
[3:02:53] <dds333a> ATSUI
[3:02:53] <+thedream_c> @Menitta emulation tech at times isn't there yet. DC emulation is still pretty buggy/unstable for some games.
[3:03:01] <%SirGO0SE> woolieGLORY
[3:03:04] <+B_Skum> this is so bad lol
[3:03:04] <%JustToWatch> @dds333a it makes so much sense for disc based systems
[3:03:06] <+thedream_c> and u may need the beefy pc specs too
[3:03:07] <+FuqBoiSlim> Marvel really brings the toxic outta mfs huh

[3:03:29] <+thedream_c> RUBY heart glitch :p
[3:03:31] <+GG_Chefboyardee> this is too funny
[3:03:34] <Shad0wTag> Get some Ruby Heart in there @woolieversus
[3:03:38] <%ggbhtg> @Menitta Nowadays, there's this thing called nullDC BEAR, an emulator loadout with online functionality. But it's not rollback. There's not a rollback solution aside from PS3/360, not even on Fightcade.
[3:03:47] <%ggbhtg> Maybe someone's working on it?
[3:03:50] <dds333a> LUL
[3:03:54] <%ggbhtg> But it ain't here yet.
[3:03:54] <+thedream_c> just glitch Woolie

[3:03:55] <%SirGO0SE> I cant believe my main man Reggie is a tier whore NotLikeThis
[3:03:57] <@Menitta> I'll look more into it. It might be the combination of also trying to get the netcode in there
[3:04:08] <%JustToWatch> "Let me show you something" = Reggie's gonna LEARN today
[3:04:09] <OblivionSword1> YEEEEEEEEE
[3:04:10] <+FuqBoiSlim> YEAAAAH

[3:04:18] <Shad0wTag> @woolieversus if this casual marvel then cool looking character picks are valid @woolieversus
[3:04:19] <alphalejandro> Ah yes Hayato, the coolest low tier character ever made
[3:04:21] <andre11dr> It's been a long time since I've seen this played by casuals LUL
[3:04:22] <%TheBesteban> Hayato is not great but I love him

[3:04:58] <blastazoid00> MAHVEL BAYBEEE
[3:05:03] <+thedream_c> there are a few glitches for MVC2 that crashes/stops the game I think
[3:05:03] <BlackhartThaGod> RyuChamp
[3:05:04] <+SanguineQuest> ARTIC ATTACK
[3:05:07] <+Axle13j> HYPE BEAM
[3:05:09] <andre11dr> Why didn't they just let him combo ?
[3:05:14] <%TheBesteban> Gambit fly glitch is the most popular
[3:05:16] <+thedream_c> LOL that colossus assist
[3:05:17] <teddygrahams82> tagnFEI
[3:05:22] <+pupil31> ICE MEME
[3:05:22] <+thedream_c> that colossus assist was the tits in MVC1
[3:05:24] <%ggbhtg> @Menitta All I can really say, is that Max and Justin play people on nullDC BEAR, also with CvS2. People are playing there, at least.
[3:05:32] <%SirGO0SE> my team was Cable, Cyclops, Ryu so I could make the big triple beam super like a scrub :)
[3:05:34] <TehMud> ITS MAHVEL
[3:05:36] <+UberWolfman> I loved that Mike Ross apparently played Star Gladiator back in the day before MVC2
[3:05:37] <OkamiDude15> Nice meme nice meme
[3:05:40] <andre11dr> Oh do the glich
[3:05:43] <+vitoxxi> colossus sounds like heavy weapons guy

[3:05:45] <+SanguineQuest> Magneto can't lose to Colossus! He's MASTER OF MAGNET!
[3:05:47] <@Menitta> @ggbhtg I did try a NullDC but it might have been the wrong one
[3:05:51] <%TheBesteban> Sick punish, Reggie
[3:05:57] <andre11dr> Do the Colossus glitch
[3:06:00] <%TheBesteban> light kick

[3:06:11] <dds333a> @vitoxxi i.e. Russian Kappa
[3:06:14] <@Menitta> Still though, even when I get it to work, the hoops shouldn't be this many. The game should just exist. So #FREEMVC2
[3:06:20] <+pupil31> YEAAHHHHHHHHHH
[3:06:24] <+thedream_c> give Reggie time. He'll learn to fly with SENTINAL
[3:06:32] <+thedream_c> cuz right now this SEntinal is TOOO grounded
[3:06:40] <speximillian> Reggie has the top tier team I see
[3:06:48] <%ggbhtg> @Menitta BEAR is in active development, same as Fightcade. But we really should have a modern PORT, with ROLLBACK. #FREEMVC2
[3:07:00] <dds333a> LUL LUL
[3:07:01] <andre11dr> That super damage LUL
[3:07:10] <+SanguineQuest> Woolie did better with the low-tier jank than he did the real team, lol

[3:15:00] <%ChoculaUltra> that shit can otg tho
[3:15:01] <andre11dr> Man Captain Commando has so much potential but they did nothing with him
[3:15:11] <+thedream_c> captain Suckass still does work
[3:15:13] <+thedream_c> as an assist
[3:15:16] <andre11dr> Most people don't even know where he comes from
[3:15:25] <+SanguineQuest> MagnetOWNED
[3:15:33] <andre11dr> They only know him from these games
[3:15:53] <+YamadaZero> Mack the Knife for the next MvC game, please.
[3:15:56] <+Arek_1> @Menitta Assist types change what attacks they would use as assists and during the Team Hyper Combo.
[3:16:22] <+Mister_Rogers> is this getting good at fighting games?
[3:16:28] <%ChoculaUltra> same goes for Hayato - you could meet a thousand gamers and prob couldn't tell you what Star Gladiator was tbf

[3:17:52] <+inkdood> The Juggy power up glitch
[3:18:02] <+Mister_Rogers> @gruulmagebeast he has a special move that buffs him
[3:18:05] <andre11dr> @gruulmagebeast You activate and switch
[3:18:09] <Solidnick18> reggie feeling it now
[3:18:11] <+thedream_c> uh oh reggie the shmooovement? he's warmed up?
[3:18:15] <+GG_Chefboyardee> There you go Reggie RTSD hggLul
[3:18:20] <%ChoculaUltra> yo Reggie be saucin' with Magneto tho
[3:18:20] <+thedream_c> see thats the thing with MVC2. It takes a few games to realy get warmed up
[3:18:25] <andre11dr> And then the buff lasts for everyone else
[3:18:32] <+thedream_c> you can't play MVC2 COLD and expect results especially with movemeent heavy teams
[3:18:43] <Solidnick18> lol
[3:18:44] <gruulmagebeast> @andre11dr right but what does that give him like what is the big change that the glitch causes
[3:18:45] <+thedream_c> LA LATA
[3:18:48] <+Mister_Rogers> the buff only goes away if you activate it again i think
[3:19:00] <+Mister_Rogers> @gruulmagebeast it's one of his special moves

[3:32:14] <%SirGO0SE> cyclops has those kicks
[3:32:15] <+thedream_c> i've seen Matrix play with him before
[3:32:15] <DedlokPM> dooddoom
[3:32:18] <dds333a> bro, the directions
[3:32:19] <speximillian> Cyclops is only good with Wong Factor
[3:32:22] <FacetiousAF> rip amingo
[3:32:22] <speximillian> lol
[3:32:27] <@Menitta> Iron Man
[3:32:28] <%ChoculaUltra> Amingo for SF6 dammit
[3:32:28] <%jinking79> Cyclops alone can carry a team
[3:32:28] <+Slime_Roy> that foot dive .... makes me want to take the chat for a riiiide doodDerp SingsNote
[3:32:30] <Super_Voltekka> EL NIÑO!
[3:32:38] <+UberWolfman> Just keep kicking in the air while Cyclopse
[3:32:41] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Amingo for Darkstalkers 4
[3:32:43] <zk_nails> Father, son, & cactus
[3:32:45] <%AlteisenReiseZ> YEAAAAAAAAAAA
[3:32:49] <+thedream_c> GEEENE SPLYCE
[3:32:50] <andre11dr> Cyclops is an assist
[3:32:55] <Brandon__Brando> making a tier list and learning matchups must of been a nightmare for this game
[3:32:55] <Applecannon63> @choculaultra and also Ruby Heart for SF6
[3:32:58] <%SanguineQuest> But when will we see the true leader of the X-Men, BEAK
[3:33:00] <+thedream_c> oh yeah Ccyclops used an assist
[3:33:04] <+thedream_c> REMEMBER guys: SCOTT WAS RIGHT
[3:33:08] <+GG_Chefboyardee> How has nobody played Storm yet is the question needs more HA
[3:33:10] <andre11dr> He picked antiair with Cyclops right?
[3:33:11] <dds333a> JEAAAAN
[3:33:12] <WeepyDevil> optic blast
[3:33:16] <DerpioParty> Why does Cyke want to splice Jean so much anyways?
[3:33:16] <+thedream_c> Reggie had storm earlier
[3:33:22] <+thedream_c> then decided to dumb down with MSP
[3:33:27] <Applecannon63> Ruby Heart<Ingrid
[3:33:27] <WeepyDevil> @GG_Chefboyardee woolie played storm some earlier i think
[3:33:27] <%ChoculaUltra> yeah actually kinda surprised we haven't heard TYPHOON yet
[3:33:28] <+UberWolfman> The best block pose ever by amingo
[3:33:29] <%jinking79> spamming kick in the air to build meter like asses
[3:33:32] <%AlteisenReiseZ> My hands are too weak for MvC2 combo shenanigans
[3:33:34] <dds333a> @gg_chefboyardee reg picked her in his first team, but she went quick
[3:33:35] <DerpioParty> yeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaah
[3:33:50] <andre11dr> Storm is actually pretty hard to play
[3:34:06] <andre11dr> It's not as simple as Sentinel
[3:34:15] <dds333a> Reg likes his modified MSP LUL
[3:34:20] <+thedream_c> yeah Storm isn't EZ PZ in this game. Even at mid/high level tourneys, if they have a storm and they aren't doing the storm shit, they get stomped
[3:34:20] <Applecannon63> Ruby Heart should come back as Streetfighter character
[3:34:40] <%SanguineQuest> Amingo's got this
[3:34:42] <+pupil31> He do be Sentinelin
[3:34:42] <DerpioParty> Don't worry, I'm sure Woolie's Amingo's got this
[3:34:55] <%Axle13j> LETS GO AMINGO
[3:34:57] <andre11dr> Amingo is actually mid
[3:35:04] <dds333a> wow
[3:35:06] <%SanguineQuest> What an upset
[3:35:07] <%Axle13j> evoCry
[3:35:08] <andre11dr> But he ain't winning against Sentinel
[3:35:13] <+Slime_Roy> doodLUL
[3:35:14] <Applecannon63> like Ruby Heart is suppose to be the protag of her own game
[3:35:17] <dds333a> @sanguinequest LUL LUL
[3:35:17] <%SanguineQuest> Change teams Reggie YOU COWARD
[3:35:20] <Super_Voltekka> WEN JIN?

[3:36:22] <Applecannon63> that would've been sick
[3:36:24] <andre11dr> Allegedly
[3:36:26] <speximillian> Triple Roll vs Triple Servbot is the hypest

[3:39:50] <+thedream_c> nah no Tony Starks here with the infinites
[3:39:52] <andre11dr> That caracter is actually broken, not in that his really good but in that it feels like they didn't think his hitboxes threw at all
[3:40:06] <+LordAlexGram> Thanks omniPanic
[3:40:08] <dds333a> LUL
[3:40:15] <+pupil31> BEGONE
[3:40:17] <andre11dr> They just threw him in like "fuck it"
[3:40:44] <+wmeldrum> Woolie challenging evo :Y

[3:40:46] <speximillian> You wanna see some chip damage, let's see some Tron Bonne
[3:40:51] <+pupil31> Magneto loves Supreme
[3:41:20] <mike2hands> woolie really want to take reggie for a ride
[3:41:21] <andre11dr> I want to at least see some of the trash caracters
[3:41:31] <inorwise> reggie running msp why am i not surprised
[3:41:54] <+wmeldrum> the musiccccc <33
[3:42:02] <superchunk121> Best Stage
[3:42:17] <speximillian> Put some rocks on him
[3:42:25] <dds333a> Nice trade LUL
[3:42:34] <+pupil31> This music sounded good with the loud ass speakers in the arcade
[3:42:37] <Applecannon63> The remix of this stage makes this classic fire~
[3:42:47] <andre11dr> So why did Japan never give a ahit about these games , is it because it's Marvel
[3:42:59] <+Arek_1> LUL
[3:43:04] <+StrawberryPantsu> This on Woolie's "Dream Come True Cast"?
[3:43:07] <%Sparkseid> poor hayato
[3:43:18] <+thedream_c> around this time I think Japan was more focused on other FGs
[3:43:19] <andre11dr> Americans and Europeans have always dominated in Marvel
[3:43:23] <dds333a> I saw it coming too, the laser was already there LUL
[3:43:34] <+StrawberryPantsu> LMAO
[3:43:34] <andre11dr> It's like the one game we have
[3:43:34] <dds333a> LUL LUL
[3:43:35] <%Sparkseid> LUL
[3:43:39] <Applecannon63> Hayato is just a poorly made star wars character in a fighter
[3:43:39] <%ggbhtg> SNIPED
[3:43:45] <DerpioParty> Poor Hayato
[3:43:48] <its_PBChoc> Nice
[3:43:49] <+thedream_c> Philipipnes apparently had a rich MVC2 scene too
[3:43:51] <alphalejandro> Hayato was here just to be cool looking and that's all
[3:43:57] <dds333a> goddamn, the side switches, I almost forgot
[3:44:04] <+StrawberryPantsu> SHMIXED
[3:44:06] <dds333a> Magneto is so broke
[3:44:15] <jl_arts> but in the end
[3:44:15] <+thedream_c> and I saw a bunch of MVC2 cabs last I was in Manila back in 2005 and shit
[3:44:19] <Applecannon63> Hayato is just a cool but poorly doned Star Wars fighter
[3:44:37] <FacetiousAF> hayato why FeelsBadMan he coulda been a contender
[3:44:37] <speximillian> Hayato can get work done, just gotta land the Energy Field and get infinite super time
[3:44:37] <dds333a> LUL
[3:44:40] <Qsmash_> but he's cooler than Star Wars D:
[3:44:41] <Mach5Mike> I felt the same about Mewtwo when I unlocked him in Melee
[3:44:50] <Applecannon63> Hell even Lucario is better
[3:44:52] <Meltgar> Now that Reggie talked about Pokemon....... Whatever happened to POKKEN?
[3:44:57] <andre11dr> While this game is broken, i still think the Marvel 3 gods are more broken
[3:45:16] <FacetiousAF> @Meltgar gonna guess covid and netcode and nintendo dropped it? these are guesses
[3:45:21] <WeepyDevil> @Meltgar switch online + namco/nintendo online
[3:45:26] <Meltgar> Ahhhhh OUch
[3:45:31] <dds333a> LUL
[3:45:33] <andre11dr> Like who's the best caracter in this Magneto or Sentinel right?
[3:45:33] <%slayabee> HYPER VIPER BEAM
[3:45:35] <+StrawberryPantsu> HYPER VIPER BEAM
[3:45:38] <@Menitta> Idk what happened to Pokken
[3:45:38] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:45:42] <speximillian> All that red life, gone
[3:45:45] <@Menitta> It was by all means successful
[3:45:54] <@Menitta> Just it got dropped like a rock
[3:45:54] <BackflipCharm> @Meltgar Pokken still has an active competitive scene with regular tournaments. They even have official tournaments hosted on the official Pokemon channels
[3:45:56] <+Maleicus> why would reggie do this
[3:46:00] <+thedream_c> @andre11dr its a rotation of like core 5-6 chars depending ont he team. Then other teams depnding on MU
[3:46:01] <@Menitta> It is still active
[3:46:01] <%elderpunch> HYPER
[3:46:13] <+thedream_c> MSP is great but there are hard countesr to it
[3:46:15] <andre11dr> MVC3 Vergil is better than those caracters
[3:46:25] <andre11dr> Better range
[3:46:26] <+thedream_c> top level MVC2 is a RPS of certain teams
[3:46:27] <+pupil31> MVC3 characters are crazy
[3:46:32] <andre11dr> Faster
[3:46:34] <+StrawberryPantsu> Man Hayato is so cool
[3:46:44] <+StrawberryPantsu> WAIT WHAT!?
[3:46:46] <andre11dr> And unblockebles
[3:46:48] <dds333a> LUL
[3:46:49] <SpookyBeef7> @andre11dr The main difference is that Marvel 2 is broken at high levels of play when people start using insanely advanced tricks. Marvel 3 is broken from the moment you start it up.
[3:46:51] <+StrawberryPantsu> He has another super?
[3:46:51] <blackkanye> Gotta land it woolie
[3:46:55] <+thedream_c> Iron man ROM teams can try feast on MSP because fuck yo neutral when u getting combo'd
[3:46:56] <andre11dr> DT just has everything
[3:47:08] <%Rainbow_Ashes> Ohshit MVC2? Nice.
[3:47:10] <dds333a> finally
[3:47:10] <+thedream_c> then some teams like Doom/STrider picked on Iron Man teams
[3:47:18] <+Arek_1> LUL
[3:47:19] <speximillian> The big choke feels bad
[3:47:19] <dds333a> He actually landed it LUL
[3:47:19] <andre11dr> And let's not even talk about Zero
[3:47:19] <+StrawberryPantsu> THE TIMB
[3:47:25] <%ggbhtg> Reggie put in that work tho
[3:47:25] <+thedream_c> then MSP ideally beat on those other teams.
[3:47:39] <Qsmash_> I'm not sure Woolie knows Hayato's combos
[3:47:41] <speximillian> Hayato needs so much work to work
[3:47:48] <dds333a> We love Cap
[3:47:52] <%SirGO0SE> megaman do the big lazor
[3:47:52] <%DukeBlack_> is US agent in this or 1?
[3:47:54] <@Menitta> bout to say lets see Mega Man
[3:47:55] <%Rainbow_Ashes> Man I used to play this all the time at the arcades.
[3:48:05] <MonadoAvocado> is this for fun?
[3:48:08] <+thedream_c> USagent as probably in MSH?
[3:48:12] <its_PBChoc> CAP AND MEGA MAN! My Dream Team
[3:48:20] <+thedream_c> i don't remember USAgent from MVC1 on
[3:48:21] <%slayabee> YEAAAAAAAAA
[3:48:21] <its_PBChoc> (speaking as a casual)
[3:48:22] <+Froyuken> @DukeBlack_ I don't think any of the secret palette swaps are in this one.
[3:48:25] <Super_Voltekka> Iron Man's infinite set to a MIDI controller is fucking bonkers
[3:48:27] <%mr_sups> Are we gonna se a FUCKIN Infinite?
[3:48:30] <andre11dr> IRON MAN
[3:48:32] <+thedream_c> yeah MVC1 hadWar Machine
[3:48:33] <Super_Voltekka> Great video
[3:48:34] <dds333a> Also, glad to see Jin, love him
[3:48:34] <+kaudera> most didn't compare to the kings of this game
[3:48:34] <+thedream_c> and REd Venum
[3:48:43] <+StrawberryPantsu> Typhoooooooon
[3:48:44] <alphalejandro> BLOOODDDDIAAA!
[3:48:46] <andre11dr> DO INFINITES YOU PUSSYS
[3:48:46] <dds333a> any day now
[3:48:55] <Remkaru> I saw a MVC2 arcade cabinet long time ago at the mall, but was removed sadly

[3:49:22] <Super_Voltekka> SUPERIOR TECH
[3:49:30] <@Menitta> HEAVY PUNCH ULTRA
[3:49:34] <andre11dr> Fuck Haiato, bring Jin back
[3:49:51] <andre11dr> Jin is so fucking cool
[3:49:53] <+Froyuken> War Machine in MVC played just like Iron Man in MSH.
[3:49:54] <+thedream_c> man imagine Spider man going from this.... to ultimately WEB BALL --> REALITY STONE
[3:50:22] <DerpioParty> Younger me thought that Strider, Captain  Commando, and Jin were supposed to be like the big 3 of Capcom due to MvC
[3:50:32] <+thedream_c> REggie u shud def play Cammy in CVS2 :p
[3:50:34] <dds333a> @derpioparty LUL

[3:52:51] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:52:53] <+thedream_c> is the MOUSE cool with it? thats the eternal question
[3:52:53] <dds333a> The FGC has already immortalized it, at least
[3:53:00] <FacetiousAF> #FreeMVC2 DISNEY ITS FREE MONEY
[3:53:02] <+kaudera> the funniest thing is that an MVC2 port is such easy money cause it would barely cost anything to port
[3:53:04] <@Menitta> It doesnt
[3:53:07] <+thedream_c> also besides that, get a modded dreamcast
[3:53:10] <@Menitta> Just put it out there so it can exist.
[3:53:14] <WakeUpThrow> After MvCI, I doubt they'll work together for a long time, unfortunately
[3:53:17] <+Froyuken> With rollback.
[3:53:20] <Kiari13> just starts into DOS LUL
[3:53:23] <+kaudera> just add lobbies and rollback and that's it
[3:53:32] <+thedream_c> i know I'm sounding facetious with it but IMO naomi version MVC2 is best version to enjoy
[3:53:35] <%DukeBlack_> iI want a future where Loki is seen playing mvc 2 in season 2
[3:53:38] <+kaudera> oh and spectate
[3:53:38] <andre11dr> No ,they'll tell you to play Avengers instead

[3:54:55] <andre11dr> Eh it's to late to get into it anyway

[3:56:03] <+thedream_c> eeehhhhh
[3:56:04] <dds333a> @jinking79 Blackheart is also pretty interesting as a char too
[3:56:12] <@Solidus_113> he was learning Magneto's infinite last night
[3:56:14] <+thedream_c> only seelct players/footage really
[3:56:18] <%ggbhtg> Either Super Gaming Bros or Super Beard Bros LUL
[3:56:24] <+thedream_c> like I know WHO to exepct from MVC2 depending on whose content it is
[3:56:27] <dds333a> OYAJIII
[3:56:38] <+Froyuken> That should be a subsection of uploads. Ass gameplay of fighting games.
[3:56:39] <+thedream_c> but if its Sajam's learning the Iron Man infinite, u know its not high tier shit :p
[3:56:47] <andre11dr> I genuinely couldn't tell you

[3:57:05] <xx_black_mage> What's the most Woolie thing a person can do?
[3:57:06] <%ggbhtg> Misunderstood Tier Kappa
[3:57:14] <+Froyuken> What about Servbot?
[3:57:15] <WakeUpThrow> Servbot though
[3:57:15] <+UberWolfman> Roll is NEGETIVE tier LUL
[3:57:17] <andre11dr> Oh boy
[3:57:17] <%ggbhtg> He's just Misunderstood Tier Kappa
[3:57:18] <@Menitta> like P Tier in Saltybet
[3:57:23] <%wibbwobbler> So much of my childhood is filled with capcom
[3:57:24] <+thedream_c> SIM in this game is ESOTERIC high tier
[3:57:26] <alphalejandro> Hayato: Dame Da Ne...
[3:57:27] <dds333a> cool CarlSmile
[3:57:28] <+MegaQuint> Servbot is actually better than Roll
[3:57:30] <andre11dr> He is
[3:57:32] <+Byr0nX> he plays like hibiki on cvs2
[3:57:32] <Jetsfantasy> What would we call match uploads like that? Shit Skirmishes?
[3:57:36] <+thedream_c> Dhalsim is mad good in thisg ame. But you gotta enter the hyperbolic chamber
[3:57:38] <%ggbhtg> TODOME DA
[3:57:38] <Samex_Comex> He has all his Plasma sword paths
[3:57:39] <+kaudera> Hayato? He's in bottom tier but def better than roll lol
[3:57:39] <Applecannon63> What!?
[3:57:44] <Super_Voltekka> MECHA GIEF PogChamp
[3:57:45] <andre11dr> Roll is worst
[3:57:58] <andre11dr> But his still really bad
[3:58:00] <%ggbhtg> TODOME DAAAAA
[3:58:03] <%ggbhtg> URYA
[3:58:08] <andre11dr> Wolverine is also trash
[3:58:10] <Deko_> PogChamp
[3:58:11] <+kaudera> yeah that's the tech LUL
[3:58:15] <+thedream_c> yeah like tier lists don't matter in low level play
[3:58:17] <dds333a> yup
[3:58:18] <%ggbhtg> the coolest thing you never did see
[3:58:19] <dds333a> LUL
[3:58:25] <+Froyuken> Don't think I've ever seen that move.
[3:58:26] <+thedream_c> u don't have a master Spiral player to shit on all y'all chars either
[3:58:27] <%Sparkseid> LUL
[3:58:34] <dds333a> no, it's cool, tho

[3:58:43] <+Akizea> god id love if ruby heart came back
[3:58:51] <+kaudera> man I wish Hayato was better 😭
[3:58:55] <eccentric_fellow> Thanos in MvC: Bubble Cuttah
[3:58:56] <+Arek_1> @WoolieVersus He turns into Black Hayato if you perform a Variable Counter (Guren, the DP).
[3:58:57] <+thedream_c> some chars in MVC2 just very gimimcky and are stuck in specific roles.
[3:59:00] <%hologram_sam> Anyone watchin EVO?
[3:59:00] <%ggbhtg> I'm just tryna be out playing X-Men vs SF characters, leave me alone
[3:59:06] <%jinking79> Thanos Bubbles
[3:59:10] <DerpioParty> Also neat Hayato thing, if he somehow can win a round, you get a cameo from another Star Gladiator fighter.
[3:59:17] <DerpioParty> If you can actually win
[3:59:22] <+thedream_c> LMAO pick SIm
[3:59:25] <@Menitta> Also hey, Capcom put out UMVC3 recently. No reason they cant work out MVC2
[3:59:26] <andre11dr> Thanos is mid
[3:59:26] <+FuqBoiSlim> Let see that Shuma play @woolieversus
[3:59:39] <%Sparkseid> Darkstalkers ARE Dead

[4:02:25] <andre11dr> Man will never gey another Darkstalkers aren't we ?
[4:02:31] <Super_Voltekka> Ryu in MvC1 was weird
[4:02:32] <%jinking79> hey it's Max's First Team doodScrub
[4:02:37] <dds333a> Darkstalkers is dead, yeah
[4:02:45] <eccentric_fellow> You trust Capcom to handle a Darkstalkers game in 2021?
[4:02:54] <andre11dr> No
[4:02:55] <+Froyuken> @Super_Voltekka All shotos in one.
[4:02:56] <+thedream_c> i def don't trust capcom with a new darkstalkers in 2021
[4:02:57] <blackkanye> Yikes
[4:03:02] <andre11dr> But what if tho
[4:03:08] <Qsmash_> I don't trust Capcom with SF anymore
[4:03:11] <+Byr0nX> stopp killin him
[4:03:12] <GeltonZ> Yeah they really CAN'T do a new Darkstalkers unless they farmed it out to ArcSys MAYBE.
[4:03:15] <+jimmyboomjenkins> I always like playing team re in mvc3
[4:03:20] <+thedream_c> i don't do what ifs. Capcom only does RE and MH. SFV is just their 'esports' wing
[4:03:32] <Jetsfantasy> Yeah, I got too burned with SFV to trust Capcom with fighting games rn
[4:03:33] <andre11dr> What if they manage to make is cartoonish and violent
[4:03:44] <eccentric_fellow> That's just it. If
[4:03:44] <Applecannon63> @thedream_c I mean not yet until they focus on Project Justice/Rival Schools
[4:03:48] <+thedream_c> ^^^ so u are trusting capcom to be different with it? LMAOOO
[4:03:54] <+Akizea> @Qsmash_ ono is gone and we see the good changes in SF5 already
[4:03:59] <+Some_guy92> #FreeMarvel2
[4:03:59] <dds333a> okay, okay LUL
[4:04:14] <andre11dr> What if they pur MH level dedication into it
[4:04:19] <andre11dr> WHAT IF
[4:04:19] <+thedream_c> As bad as ONO is, Capcom isn't about gambling with unheard of IPs
[4:04:24] <dds333a> Nash, let's go Omega Red too
[4:04:25] <+Byr0nX> REDDO
[4:04:25] <WakeUpThrow> I would kill for a Capcom vs Capcom, but I'm sure that's a monkey paw and a half
[4:04:32] <%jinking79> kill the tyrant super
[4:04:35] <prime_name> SUGAH
[4:04:35] <+thedream_c> @andre11dr they woudl've done it already. But MHW has priority one. Producer is related to CEO
[4:04:38] <FacetiousAF> did i miss ruby heart?
[4:04:43] <speximillian> Omega DESTROYAH
[4:04:43] <@Menitta> yee Jill
[4:04:46] <+thedream_c> there is ar eason why Cpacom COASTED off MH. Because it PRINTS MONEY
[4:04:48] <+jimmyboomjenkins> I miss when fgs didn’t have gta5 loading times😭
[4:04:53] <%livlinn> Jill PrideRise
[4:04:54] <+thedream_c> FGs for Cpacom DOES NOT PRINT MONEY a
[4:05:17] <+Froyuken> If I could change one thing for an MVC2 rerelease, give the characters their idle animations back in the character select screen.
[4:05:19] <%jinking79> the anger of Blackwidow replacing Jill
[4:05:24] <+thedream_c> @jimmyboomjenkins i agrtee with this boomer take
[4:05:31] <FacetiousAF> venom PogChamp
[4:05:36] <+thedream_c> WE ARE VENUM
[4:05:37] <Jetsfantasy> @Froyuken Ooh, a very small but fantastic idea
[4:05:40] <%livlinn> venooom grymLove
[4:05:41] <alphalejandro> I would ask rather for CVS2, now that's look a more feasible dream
[4:05:59] <andre11dr> @thedream_c GG also didn't make big money, but then Strive happened
[4:06:08] <andre11dr> You need to take chances
[4:06:16] <dds333a> when's Carnage tho Kappa
[4:06:18] <FacetiousAF> nashty
[4:06:20] <+thedream_c> @andre11dr Capcom is a bigger company. ASW only has GG as their star IP and its weak to begin with.
[4:06:22] <Applecannon63> @thedream_c I nakayama is doing good job with SFV and also unearthing some good ass art footage of the old build of capcom allstars
[4:06:24] <andre11dr> FGs can sell good in 2021
[4:06:31] <FacetiousAF> @dds333a theaters august 8th Kappa
[4:06:43] <+thedream_c> what Jill? A member of what?
[4:06:44] <blackkanye> I'm a member of STARS Kreygasm
[4:06:55] <%ggbhtg> Omega Red was in COTA and then MSH vs SF. So he's one of the OGs, actually. @WoolieVersus
[4:06:57] <+Akizea> iunno, all im sayin is that darkstalkers has about the same chance to come back as some of their other IP's too
[4:06:57] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:07:03] <blackkanye> COME ON
[4:07:08] <speximillian> Charging S.T.A.R.S. is great
[4:07:08] <+thedream_c> @Applecannon63 that still doesn't take away that Capcom isn't going to risk big money on an unproven IP
[4:07:09] <+pupil31> I still can't believe they added Jill to this game Kreygasm
[4:07:09] <%Irridium> COMEONCOMEONCOMEON
[4:07:09] <@Menitta> COME ON
[4:07:09] <%ggbhtg> come on come on come on come on come on

[4:07:31] <dds333a> already did LUL
[4:07:32] <+thedream_c> gambit was on earlier and Reggie lost with him
[4:07:32] <+Akizea> @thedream_c they're literally making a new next gen IP RIGHT NOW
[4:07:41] <+MooseIsGoose> dang missed it
[4:07:41] <Super_Voltekka> Take you to the Chaos Dimension
[4:07:44] <dds333a> Reg got Gambit killed LUL
[4:07:47] <+Akizea> pragmata is happening for ps5 as we speak lol
[4:07:48] <eccentric_fellow> RIP X-Men in MvC lol
[4:07:49] <andre11dr> Do the gambit glitch you scrubs
[4:07:52] <speximillian> Anakris!
[4:07:58] <SomersaultJustice> that disgusting monster son son
[4:08:00] <speximillian> Sonson is also monster
[4:08:01] <dds333a> now THIS is a rare character, unfortunately
[4:08:02] <%jinking79> woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE
[4:08:02] <%livlinn> monke
[4:08:05] <+MooseIsGoose> Venom then cause he is cool
[4:08:07] <AppleBerryKitty> SONSON!!
[4:08:13] <+Froyuken> @SomersaultJustice Total monster.
[4:08:16] <GeltonZ> YEEEEEEEEEEEAH!!! SON SON! BEST GIRL! Woolie isalmost playing my team!
[4:08:19] <Applecannon63> Is Black Heart Original?
[4:08:23] <Super_Voltekka> Sonson is the granddaughter of the original Sonson according to the lore
[4:08:25] <andre11dr> I main Blackhart
[4:08:29] <FacetiousAF> blckheart is marvel
[4:08:29] <GeltonZ> @Applecannon63 Nope he's Marvel
[4:08:30] <@Menitta> goddamnit Maguma
[4:08:32] <andre11dr> His actually really good
[4:08:35] <+thedream_c> @Akizea like AAA big money with marketing like MH and backing from the higher ups that will be a long running series? Bet
[4:08:38] <FacetiousAF> i beleive Ghost Rider or Dr. Strange
[4:08:41] <dds333a> Blackheart is an OG Daredevil villain
[4:08:47] <FacetiousAF> HE'S DAREDEVIL?!
[4:08:47] <acceldie> monke lady
[4:08:54] <dds333a> while also being very sympathetic
[4:08:55] <+thedream_c> Blackheart is from Marvel's magic/demon dimension stuff
[4:08:59] <Super_Voltekka> And he's the son of Mephisto
[4:09:11] <+thedream_c> yeah he's related to Mephisto whose Marvel's long running demon
[4:09:14] <iloveTSA> he's from care bears
[4:09:27] <SomersaultJustice> hit em with the big dong stick
[4:09:29] <andre11dr> I played Blackhart Cable Comando and it turned out to be a really annoying team to fight a against
[4:09:31] <+thedream_c> tho I think it was easier to market STrange/Dormammu later on as Marvel's magical protag/antagonists
[4:09:32] <SomersaultJustice> yeyeye
[4:09:37] <+MooseIsGoose> I think he Mephisto son
[4:09:37] <Applecannon63> you mean the humanized kid?
[4:09:39] <alphalejandro> POW
[4:09:39] <+pupil31> POW
[4:09:41] <+Froyuken> You could play a Mephesto in MSH. Just a red version of Blackheart, though.
[4:09:48] <speximillian> POW~
[4:10:01] <+Akizea> @thedream_c no idea if its gonna be a series but it depends on how it does i suppose
[4:10:15] <dds333a> @facetiousaf I know. a lot of long running villains came from the Daredevil/Iron Fist/Luke Cage era, and they just grew from there
[4:10:27] <+thedream_c> @Akizea thats my point. Capcom isn't playing around with big money to make IPs along with marketing and their reputation.
[4:10:27] <andre11dr> Armageddon Woolie
[4:10:33] <andre11dr> It's really good
[4:10:48] <andre11dr> It fills to hole screen LUL
[4:10:50] <%ggbhtg> Mystic SLASH
[4:11:00] <+Akizea> @thedream_c but arguably the new ip is incredibly expensive too
[4:11:02] <%ggbhtg> WASTE of FLESH
[4:11:06] <andre11dr> Ok never mind LUL
[4:11:18] <+Akizea> @thedream_c and considering the fact that they already own darkstalkers its probably CHEAPER lol
[4:11:21] <Johannen> monkaS
[4:11:31] <%ggbhtg> HISTORY in the MAKING
[4:11:43] <andre11dr> SERVEBOT
[4:11:43] <@Menitta> I feel like Rival Schools would be more successful than a new Darkstalkers
[4:11:48] <Super_Voltekka> >Not showing off Thanos in a post-Endgame world peepoLeave
[4:11:49] <DrkJP520> I was here!
[4:11:49] <+Akizea> right now would absolutely be the best time to bring a new darkstalkers out if they can give it personality
[4:11:58] <+MooseIsGoose> I remember I played Ruby, Gambit, and then venom for the longest time
[4:12:05] <+Akizea> @Menitta highkey same because the only real 3d fighter in the market is tekken lol
[4:12:13] <+thedream_c> LMAOOO FUCK YES
[4:12:16] <andre11dr> C'mon we need to see Servebot and Roll at least once tonight
[4:12:17] <+thedream_c> REGGIE u know now

[4:12:19] <+Arek_1> LUL
[4:12:19] <+thedream_c> the POWER OF LA LATA
[4:12:29] <@Menitta> Im just thinking because anime
[4:12:30] <GeltonZ> @Menitta Rival Schools would ABSOLUTELY be more successful than a new Darkstalkers...but they gotta go all-in on the dating sim. Make it into Persona but a fighting game instead of an RPG.
[4:12:45] <dds333a> @geltonz fuck you LUL
[4:12:50] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Ahh the music
[4:13:05] <%BallerSwagBro9k> MvC2 OST was the purest fire
[4:13:08] <acceldie> Rivals schools isn't Rival Schools without the Dating sim tho
[4:13:12] <GeltonZ> @dds333a Rival Schools is the dating sim fighting game. They removed the main game mode from the US version.
[4:13:36] <andre11dr> While i don't hate this OST i miss the hype caracter themes
[4:13:53] <%ggbhtg> When the dating is so popular, they made a PS1 JP only sequel FOCUSED on the DATING SIM
[4:13:55] <@Menitta> it is weird that this game has only original music
[4:13:58] <andre11dr> I get why they couldn't do but still
[4:13:58] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:13:59] <acceldie> That's why they havent made one in ages bro, the dating sim was more popular than the actual game in japan
[4:14:08] <Applecannon63> @geltonz so basically Persona Arena if they had a dating sim
[4:14:13] <+MooseIsGoose> You thought
[4:14:16] <Aydarkzero> did woolie do an infinite yet?
[4:14:20] <%BallerSwagBro9k> KomodoHype
[4:14:23] <%ggbhtg> sike u thought
[4:14:29] <Dave_VD> Damn cable's win pose is sweet
[4:14:31] <dds333a> @aydarkzero what do you think Kappa
[4:14:40] <alphalejandro> And the end of the day MVC2 is just an official mugen game
[4:14:43] <Aydarkzero> Kappa
[4:14:44] <%DukeBlack_> @Applecannon63 so regular persona
[4:14:53] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Wanna see a fookin infinite?
[4:14:56] <GeltonZ> @Applecannon63 XD Kinda? I mean more just...Persona with the dungeons replaced with fights. Like walk around, raise Social Links with Rival Schools characters, go on dates, get in fights.
[4:15:02] <%ggbhtg> @BallerSwagBro9k well TOO BAD
[4:15:18] <+pupil31> POGGERS
[4:15:26] <+FuqBoiSlim> yo?
[4:15:28] <+pupil31> He do be doin the infinite
[4:15:31] <acceldie> the official mugen game will always be Capcom Fighting Evolution
[4:15:44] <dds333a> @acceldie unfortunately
[4:15:50] <Dave_VD> Was that a baby in a mech?
[4:15:50] <Applecannon63> FUCKING INFINITES
[4:15:51] <Warlofe320> Between the Clock Tower stage and the Clown stage. What stage would you like to see return for a possible MVC4?
[4:15:52] <+Froyuken> @acceldie You're not wrong.
[4:16:04] <+Froyuken> Clock tower stage.
[4:16:05] <%AlteisenReiseZ> WE CurseLit DEMAND CurseLit LOW CurseLit TIERS
[4:16:18] <Applecannon63> @dave_vd yup a team member of Captain commando
[4:16:27] <GeltonZ> Yeah I wanna know if Woolie knows about Ratio Marvel. I wanna see him try a Ratio team.
[4:16:37] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Lol this feels like watching SaltyBet
[4:16:39] <+misterwaifuu> snitch on em
[4:16:50] <+UberWolfman> WE lytFOLD DEMAND lytFOLD ROBOTS
[4:16:54] <andre11dr> There are actual Mugen Capcom fighters that had more efort put into them than Fighting Jam
[4:17:04] <%ggbhtg> @GeltonZ talked about it earlier
[4:17:05] <Warlofe320> What Marvel sprite they didn't use for MVC 2?
[4:17:19] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Speaking of which we need another Salty Bet watchalong stream
[4:17:19] <GeltonZ> @ggbhtg Cool.
[4:17:26] <Qsmash_> they used them all
[4:17:26] <SomersaultJustice> pick charlie
[4:17:32] <+marumariball> @Warlofe320 that comedian guy from Marvel Vs SF
[4:17:34] <blackkanye> Baby Commando came to BM
[4:17:42] <+sugarboi_> sugarboi_ subscribed with Prime. 
[4:17:43] <dds333a> Nash was already picked too LUL
[4:17:45] <alphalejandro> @andre11dr This, and MVC1 tecnically, everything after X-Men CoA, CVS1&2
[4:17:47] <%AlteisenReiseZ> FREE THE ROSTER, GIVE US THE LOW TIERS
[4:17:55] <dds333a> Reggie got him killed as well
[4:18:02] <Applecannon63> @acceldie Capcom Fighting Jam is just a beta mugen
[4:18:04] <+Froyuken> Jugg's walk animation was so nerfed in all the ports that weren't 4MB Saturn.
[4:18:05] <acceldie> @andre11dr Gotta give credit that Ingrid is a full on new character, best a capcom mugen can do is a character edit with like missing frames
[4:18:09] <SomersaultJustice> aww I wanted to see that
[4:18:12] <+marumariball> Norimaro was the guy, only missing character
[4:18:39] <andre11dr> @acceldie Nah Mugen can do hole new sprites
[4:18:49] <andre11dr> Look at Hipper DBZ
[4:18:49] <+Arek_1> @Warlofe320 Swamp, Airship, and Industrial are great picks, as well.
[4:18:54] <Brandon__Brando> I loy
[4:19:02] <Applecannon63> @marumariball purposely missing because too lewd jokes
[4:19:11] <dds333a> JUGGERNAUT
[4:19:13] <Brandon__Brando> I love the sprites in this game
[4:19:21] <Shad0wTag> !uptime
[4:19:21] <@Moobot> @Shad0wTag WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 4 hours and 19 minutes
[4:19:23] <Applecannon63> @marumariball also because he is based of an actual comedian
[4:19:27] <alphalejandro> SFAlpha3 is also tecnically a mugen..."tecnically"
[4:19:33] <%ggbhtg> @Applecannon63 lewd?
[4:19:47] <Applecannon63> @ggbhtg the nose bleed super
[4:20:11] <%ggbhtg> OPTIMAL
[4:20:13] <dds333a> LUL
[4:20:19] <acceldie> Nose bleed and Looking at dem ladies panties
[4:20:19] <%ggbhtg> OPTIMAL GAMEPLAY
[4:20:26] <%ggbhtg> OPTIMAL GAMEPLAY at this level
[4:20:27] <+FuqBoiSlim> hey as long as it works
[4:20:38] <alphalejandro> OPTIMUS GAMEPLAY
[4:20:44] <Applecannon63> he had an unused super anomation of him nose bleeding where he imagining lady fighter's panties
[4:21:00] <+Froyuken> Anyone else notices the slight changes in the music between the arcade and home versions?
[4:21:01] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:21:02] <andre11dr> Oh Japan
[4:21:16] <andre11dr> Always with the panties
[4:21:17] <+FuqBoiSlim> @applecannon63 he's just like me!
[4:21:18] <Brandon__Brando> he went up a step stool
[4:21:20] <acceldie> He would be cancelled nowadays if he was in a new marvel
[4:21:48] <%ggbhtg> @Applecannon63 Welp. It was unused, so whatevs.
[4:21:56] <Qsmash_> he got "cancelled" back in the day so yeah
[4:21:56] <Applecannon63> oh yeah he also has a throw thats just the kanchou before Faust
[4:22:19] <%ggbhtg> It's a good that's totally fine.....SOMEHOW...
[4:22:24] <andre11dr> He was only in tbe JP version anyway
[4:22:26] <%ggbhtg> *good thing
[4:22:31] <+thedream_c> wait how is A3 a Mugen exactly?
[4:22:35] <andre11dr> So who cares that his not here
[4:22:37] <%ggbhtg> oooooh Japan
[4:22:38] <+thedream_c> is it due to custom combos?
[4:22:53] <dds333a> LUL LUL
[4:23:02] <acceldie> Alpha 3 MAX on the psp is basically a mugen
[4:23:08] <+thedream_c> oh the PSP version
[4:23:16] <+thedream_c> oh yeah cuz of the 4 added new chars too
[4:23:21] <+thedream_c> but the modes are cool tho
[4:23:29] <+thedream_c> like the world tour mode where u get a choice who to face?
[4:23:30] <andre11dr> That's the one with Ingrid right ?
[4:23:42] <%ggbhtg> does Alpha 3 really not have enough original elements to avoid being considered a Mugen? really?
[4:23:44] <+thedream_c> damn I miss like a world tour mode
[4:23:44] <acceldie> CVS2 sprites in alpha
[4:23:54] <dds333a> Storm takes a bit more LUL
[4:24:00] <Applecannon63> @acceldie more like Alpha 3 Max is just a swap mod of CVS2 and Fighting Jam
[4:24:18] <+thedream_c> oh yeah A3 Max specifically on PSP
[4:24:24] <Applecannon63> *port mod
[4:24:24] <+Froyuken> This the X-Men initiation match for Captain Commando.
[4:24:31] <andre11dr> They should bring Maki back
[4:24:49] <acceldie> Never seen anybody play Maki ever in my life
[4:24:52] <andre11dr> They brought back the Final Fight 3 girl
[4:24:56] <andre11dr> Why not
[4:25:03] <dds333a> Lucia is back, true
[4:25:19] <andre11dr> Maki is cool in CvS 3
[4:25:30] <andre11dr> She has slide grabs
[4:25:32] <+thedream_c> Lucia is more like semi recent long trend of Capcom using Final Fight chars for their mainline FGs
[4:25:41] <andre11dr> He has the wall slamms
[4:25:52] <+thedream_c> like in SF4 / SFxT u saw the most influx of Final Fight chars to appear in a Capcom FG
[4:25:53] <dds333a> @thedream_c true, whic his what we're saying
[4:25:59] <andre11dr> She's not good but she's not trash
[4:26:08] <dds333a> For example, Abigail and whatnot
[4:26:16] <+thedream_c> yeah and nobody asked for Abigail
[4:26:18] <%ggbhtg> the vibe is known
[4:26:23] <+Froyuken> No one ever does Cable's other super.
[4:26:25] <+thedream_c> nobodfy asked for Rolento either but he was kooky enough
[4:26:38] <%ggbhtg> the viper vibe
[4:26:51] <+Arek_1> LUL
[4:26:53] <dds333a> @froyuken Woolie did Time Flip, like, twice earlier, and landed neither
[4:26:53] <SomersaultJustice> LUL
[4:26:56] <andre11dr> What was more of a mistake Abigail or Fang?
[4:26:59] <dds333a> LUL LUL
[4:27:01] <%Sparkseid> ah shit
[4:27:02] <acceldie> the only CVS2/A3MAX character i want back is Eagle, he spins
[4:27:10] <%ggbhtg> SHUN GOKU SALTY
[4:27:10] <jermanatorone81> lol I’d rather fight rolento in street fighter than in final fight
[4:27:22] <+thedream_c> I think the SFV new chars were mostly duds. Some were studs like Laura aka Sean's sister
[4:27:27] <+thedream_c> and Menat
[4:27:28] <Yemmer> fuckin' jinkies dude, yall hear about Latam strive top 8 getting cancelled
[4:27:36] <+Froyuken> @dds333a Probably why no one uses it as much as HVB.
[4:27:48] <dds333a> @froyuken truth LUL
[4:27:59] <GeltonZ> @Yemmer Because of Brazillian internet? XD Yeah there was some talk about that earlier.
[4:28:08] <%Sparkseid> @yemmer seriously?!
[4:28:08] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1423196401152974850?s=19
[4:28:19] <+thedream_c> damn not even rollback can get LATAM strive top 8 to be stable
[4:28:21] <%Sparkseid> what a mess
[4:28:24] <acceldie> Truly Brazil moment
[4:28:27] <+thedream_c> but I mean it be do
[4:28:27] <andre11dr> @thedream_c Rashid ,Menat G
[4:28:29] <Yemmer> official as of 5 minutes ago on Evo's twitter
[4:28:39] <+thedream_c> oh yeah Rashid is aite. G is solid.
[4:28:40] <dds333a> Reg is serious Kappa
[4:28:45] <%Sparkseid> welp
[4:28:49] <andre11dr> C'mon SFV had some good new caracters
[4:28:49] <+thedream_c> REG is serious about the re fly? BET
[4:28:58] <andre11dr> Definitely better than SF4
[4:29:01] <+thedream_c> @andre11dr i'm sayin there were studs and there were DUDS
[4:29:12] <+thedream_c> more duds IMO than studs
[4:29:24] <acceldie> Lotta boys
[4:29:30] <@Menitta> SF4's good new characters are better than 5's good ones but 4's bad ones are way worse than 4's bad ones
[4:29:36] <GeltonZ> Menat ALMOST makes me wanna play SFV.
[4:29:37] <andre11dr> O i hate Abigail and i forgot Fang exists
[4:29:37] <@Menitta> 5's

[4:29:59] <SomersaultJustice> lol I like fang
[4:30:04] <acceldie> The oil man is not real, he was never in street fighter
[4:30:08] <dds333a> LUL LUL LUL
[4:30:13] <andre11dr> Also the stick girl she really basic and boring
[4:30:14] <+thedream_c> but OIL MAN is top tier when OILED UP
[4:30:15] <%Sparkseid> high level marvel
[4:30:17] <%ggbhtg> J wong is streaming btw :)
[4:30:19] <PMda2nd> better than me
[4:30:21] <%hologram_sam> he'll yeah brother
[4:30:23] <andre11dr> Can't even remember her name
[4:30:25] <@Menitta> You're yelling "WE IN THERE" and it cuts to a kiddie pool
[4:30:30] <%ggbhtg> Feels Badminton
[4:30:32] <@Menitta> but FUN WAS HAD
[4:30:33] <+thedream_c> Ed and Flake
[4:30:35] <+thedream_c> i mean Falke
[4:30:43] <+Froyuken> @andre11dr ...stick girl?
[4:30:46] <+thedream_c> aka the shadalooo warehouse rejects
[4:30:48] <@Menitta> #FREEMVC2
[4:30:53] <dds333a> everyone can have a plate
[4:30:55] <andre11dr> Ed is cool gameplay but looks really stupid
[4:30:58] <Veserados> Fun matches! SeemsGood
[4:31:00] <%ggbhtg> but hey guess what, #FREEMV2 tho
[4:31:03] <+thedream_c> Ed is meh.
[4:31:04] <%ggbhtg> It's a LEGACY
[4:31:16] <@Menitta> there are hoops
[4:31:24] <dds333a> B.A.N
[4:31:34] <alphalejandro> SFV newcomers: Necalli, Laura, Rashid, Menat, Falke, Ed, FANG, G and Luke, so 9 in total.
[4:31:40] <andre11dr> This is not something you can buy right now
[4:31:45] <Meltgar> My boi sodom still dead af
[4:31:46] <@Menitta> Also fuck the promotional reasons for why this cant come back. They put MVC3 out recently. They can do it with this
[4:31:49] <andre11dr> But maybe some other way
[4:31:56] <+thedream_c> true but at the same time, old games are always out of your way to support
[4:31:58] <%ggbhtg> it will NEVER DIE, but it can live anew
[4:32:09] <%kewlmyc> Free CvS2 next please
[4:32:12] <dds333a> no, no, do it with everything
[4:32:12] <+thedream_c> EXACTLY woolie
[4:32:13] <@Solidus_113> Can I also get the original Online Edition of 3rd Strike while we're at it?
[4:32:14] <alphalejandro> @andre11dr Like a lot, o classic fighting games
[4:32:18] <+Froyuken> Oh yeah, you can stull but MVC3 digitally.
[4:32:24] <+Froyuken> still buy*
[4:32:25] <+thedream_c> the old and biggset fans of MVC2 are long committed
[4:32:26] <dds333a> LUL
[4:32:31] <ChansonNoire> @Menitta that was like 4-5 years ago
[4:32:38] <+Some_guy92> #FreeMarvel2
[4:32:38] <+thedream_c> they didn't just try it out and come back to it every so often. They LOVE the fucking game to its core
[4:32:43] <@Menitta> You can still buy it and it was after Disney said fuck Xmen
[4:32:51] <andre11dr> As long as Sanford lives MBC2 2 won't die
[4:32:51] <dds333a> LUL LUL
[4:33:05] <%ggbhtg> y'all don't e-en know
[4:33:05] <BlackermanZX> Thats some good ass mahvel
[4:33:12] <%kewlmyc> kewlmyc subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! Woot, 12 months.  Keep on keeping on.
[4:33:14] <Kitsunerasu> imo a cvs has a higher chance of happening since neo geo pocket got re released on the eshop..but mvc has a VERY low chance of happening. but man would it be nice to play both with rollback online
[4:33:15] <dds333a> Cable is LITERALLY team scrub
[4:33:15] <+thedream_c> Reggie wanted to move and I can see it
[4:33:24] <%mr_sups> CJC sounds less like a Marvel Team and more like a Marvel Player
[4:33:25] <%ggbhtg> Y'ALL DON'T E-EN KNOW! About CJC!
[4:33:27] <+thedream_c> I resepct Reggie's desire for SHMOOVEMENT
[4:33:43] <+thedream_c> cuz Reggie tried other non shmoove teams/chars and he looked like he wanted to come back to MSP after
[4:33:51] <andre11dr> Cable from day one to EVO finals will carry you
[4:33:53] <+Some_guy92> Ask Yipes for all the MVC2 knowledge
[4:34:07] <+thedream_c> Yipes, Matrix, there are other wise heads out there
[4:34:17] <%ggbhtg> @Some_guy92 More J Wong, he streaming MvC2 right now LUL
[4:34:20] <+thedream_c> Ruin, Mike CHaos

[4:34:52] <andre11dr> Yipes ,Matrix, Justin, Clockwork,
[4:34:59] <andre11dr> The goods
[4:35:04] <+thedream_c> MSP def has the richest history of a team being developed
[4:35:08] <+thedream_c> Spiral
[4:35:08] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:35:12] <+thedream_c> SPIRAL
[4:35:16] <brunoberserk> LIGHT PUNCH
[4:35:17] <+thedream_c> DUC's spiral is... something else
[4:35:31] <+thedream_c> Spiral is what makes Duc's shit work.
[4:35:34] <%ggbhtg> but where Gambit at
[4:35:43] <%ggbhtg> FeelsBadMan
[4:35:53] <andre11dr> Damn we never saw Iron Man tonight
[4:36:01] <%ggbhtg> we did
[4:36:02] <+thedream_c> we saw iron man. Just no infinite :p
[4:36:03] <Meltgar> I think woolie picked Ironman
[4:36:09] <%ggbhtg> proton cannon was heard
[4:36:09] <+thedream_c> we saw PROTON CANNON
[4:36:09] <dds333a> Iron Man was out a bit, woolz picked him
[4:36:13] <andre11dr> It's fine, it not like they're pulling out infinite
[4:36:23] <dds333a> @ggbhtg rip Remy
[4:36:27] <+thedream_c> the infinite isn't EZ. it must be practiced and learned
[4:36:40] <+thedream_c> just ask the white guys who made all those Iron Man infinite content on YT
[4:36:43] <+UberWolfman> EVO could not handle brazilian wifi LUL
[4:36:44] <%ggbhtg> I did not observe Thanos gameplay, but I probably blinked and missed it
[4:37:06] <+thedream_c> its just rumors for now
[4:37:08] <andre11dr> At this point  Marvel 3 will look like that with Woolie
[4:37:09] <alphalejandro> Yes
[4:37:11] <generalve> ED BOON says he wants to
[4:37:11] <+thedream_c> until it becomes... an injustice
[4:37:13] <dds333a> @ggbhtg yeah, HE was never picked
[4:37:13] <brunoberserk> is okay because MUGEN EXISTS
[4:37:15] <@Menitta> Oh yeah those were rumors of Marvel vs DC by NRG
[4:37:20] <%ggbhtg> a rumor that has stagnated
[4:37:23] <+thedream_c> LMAOO remember DC vs MK?
[4:37:30] <@Menitta> Theres been nothing since
[4:37:32] <+thedream_c> that was some pinnacle shit
[4:37:43] <andre11dr> It's a rumor
[4:37:58] <dds333a> Maybe someday
[4:38:12] <+Dova573> Give ME ASURA IN FIGHTING GAME
[4:38:13] <+Some_guy92> Give the people what they want SwiftRage
[4:38:19] <andre11dr> I don't think Disney cares about that shit
[4:38:19] <%Sparkseid> and TVC
[4:38:23] <@Solidus_113> Monster hunters vs Asura
[4:38:26] <%jolene_orenji> when's capcom vs capcom
[4:38:26] <%ggbhtg> Do you think Teppen has anything to do with testing the waters for CvC interest? @WoolieVersus
[4:38:27] <+thedream_c> TvC was bomnb tho
[4:38:27] <+Ben_Ben817> Nero and V Kreygasm
[4:38:27] <+Arek_1> Bass. EXE.
[4:38:27] <BlackermanZX> Capcom all stars
[4:38:32] <dds333a> fuck, WESKER is already there
[4:38:33] <+thedream_c> TvC was well fleshed out IMO
[4:38:34] <andre11dr> Assura
[4:38:39] <+thedream_c> Ryu in TvC was legit
[4:38:40] <FacetiousAF> bro forte battle network?!
[4:38:41] <@Menitta> Apollo Justice
[4:38:46] <GeltonZ> TvC is my favorite VS game.
[4:38:54] <+thedream_c> liek in some of the VS games Ryu is ass. But in TvC he was LEGIT
