[0:10:34] <%doomerskeletor13> @staticshock5 Imo DmC is mediocre. DMC 2 is just straight up bad.
[0:10:37] <%Theycallmenerf> Giga Marionette
[0:10:44] <PleasantLeech> Konami is the prime example of the flaws of capitalism. Konami is a failure in morality but a success in capitalism.
[0:10:51] <coreybom> @staticshock5 DmC, most likely the original version since definitive is actually pretty fun.

[0:12:03] <%Chatterbox1991> MrDestructoid500 Just wanted to relay a story related to how much of a trash rag Resetera is; about a year ago, CD Prodijk Red got into a little troble after making an inoffensive joke on twitter about "Assuming Gender" thus prompting the whole of Resetera to erupt in outrage, screaming transphobia and anyone who said anything contrary this or attempted to civilly defend CD Prodojk was was instabanned; Resetera is fucking trashfire and you would do well to stay aay. Put this in the blood pool.

[0:19:37] <Prevot> except smash players, theyre totally like that
[0:19:43] <Pookiedaexzile> The Red bars must be set upon

[0:19:51] <mistermastergreg> did they start already? are they on a break?
[0:19:56] <Pookiedaexzile> They must be culled with the red hot fires of the hellflame
[0:19:58] <%McSoliace> if rollback netcode was more common none of these problems would be anywhere near as bad
[0:19:59] <Pookiedaexzile> and so he said it
[0:20:00] <MayorRev> LUL
[0:20:00] <MONSTR_UwU> pool on hard mode

[0:20:05] <%jiggy_snipe> I like that analogy

[0:20:10] <MrBorisMakarov> MrBorisMakarov subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months!
[0:20:11] <lucain_wreath> That's the pool randomizer run
[0:20:11] <+DesertPenguin> MAKES IT EXCITING
[0:20:19] <HeroToxiko> LUL
[0:20:20] <+D00msDayDan> can we go one stream without this wifi warriors shit coming up
[0:20:21] <+eanscrale> No one likes playing pool with Diavolo.
[0:20:27] <+DesertPenguin> I'll try that next time at the bar and not get into a fight LUL
[0:20:28] <Pookiedaexzile> Red bars must be excised
[0:20:29] <+linSP> The balls are inert
[0:20:30] <tuesti> the lag spices it up
[0:20:31] <%Th3SmartAlec> @d00msdaydan no
[0:20:34] <+Lightning_Bolt_Action> red bars go home
[0:20:35] <HeroToxiko> @D00msDayDan no
[0:20:35] <wegood456> Only Red Bars can fight other Red Bars
[0:20:38] <%gatorafan> Just hit the balls 4Head
[0:20:39] <%tearfuldevil> @D00msDayDan woolie will never stop lol
[0:20:48] <HeroToxiko> Red bar gulag today PogChamp
[0:20:57] <%Th3SmartAlec> @wegood456 it's the same type of red bar!
[0:21:00] <Pookiedaexzile> Wifi players deserve no sympathy
[0:21:02] <KaironFortressKnight> "Some people cant afford wired" is my favorite quote of the week
[0:21:04] <+Lightning_Bolt_Action> guLAG
[0:21:05] <Jontman42> I mean it's the same with any online game that requires precision
[0:21:05] <HumBao> Smug outplaying a laggy player last night was epic
[0:21:10] <%Sparkseid> Boo that person
[0:21:19] <thorn0516> red bars did nothing wrong Kappa
[0:21:20] <scrumbotime> I got super tired of Wifi bullshit, so I went and bought a cheap 20 dollar 100 foot long cable to run all the way from my basement to the router, and that didn't just fix my Fighting Games but it made my Actual Internet Use and downloading better
[0:21:22] <masterfire23> forget wifi why don't most fighting games run at higher framerates
[0:21:22] <%GodsAndHumans> ADAPT OR DIE. USE ETHERNET CABLE
[0:21:22] <%jiggy_snipe> Developers recommend wired for online play
[0:21:29] <HeroToxiko> @Lightning_Bolt_Action PogChamp
[0:21:29] <%Bluwizard21> plague of gripes cant get wired
[0:21:33] <%CaptainPileDriver> so you're playing uno, and every couple seconds they randomly get rid of a card in their hand it's either a wild draw 4 or draw two every time
[0:21:34] <Prevot> good online is exact what is needed to sell games tho
[0:21:38] <valriot> To be fair, the larger issue is just fighting games being 15 years behind the norm
[0:21:42] <%DaBigVitus> shout outs to the dude in his underwear, laying on the floor using a fightstick
[0:21:44] <lucain_wreath> Simply force packet loss on everybody so all play on an equally laggy playing field for everyone
[0:21:50] <%punch_ghost> Saw this convo, this person still doesn't get it
[0:21:54] <%jiggy_snipe> anyway, you shouldn't force someone to play against someone of wifi if they don't want to
[0:21:54] <user_naim> Can‚Äôt save em all Woolie
[0:21:55] <%Ashenik1> Woolie VS Empathy
[0:21:58] <NobleHeart92> wooliePOYO
[0:22:00] <@akuda_bar> it's like being in a zoom call whose shit isn't muted, they can't feel the shittiness so they don't notice it's causing an issue
[0:22:01] <HeroToxiko> @Bluwizard21 i remember his teleporting souls invasion. shame, guLAGGED
[0:22:01] <PleasantLeech> even a cable doesn't help me and I pay over $200 usd a month so fuck me

[0:23:34] <%optimasmaximas> paige said last night she hadn;t slept for 17+ hours
[0:23:37] <+eanscrale> If you have wifi, you have a router with ETHERNET PORTS
[0:23:44] <%Solidnick18> they schedule said march so yeah

[0:23:49] <invader_rin> Was that Terminator theme?
[0:23:51] <+FadingEmber> If the devs don't have good netcode. I blame them before anyone playing on wifi...
[0:23:55] <andrei11dr> It's fine, i was using this as a podcast as i was eating my curry anyway
[0:23:58] <%Th3SmartAlec> @akuda_bar got
[0:23:59] <staticshock5> What's funny is because of my internet, my connections for most fighting games run well even though I'm on WiFi.

[0:24:25] <turbofolk> oh boi here we go
[0:24:28] <AppleBoi85> rape and tear until it's done... FOR THE PLAN
[0:24:31] <%Visorak6> it's not about the content's viewpoint
[0:24:31] <%CaptainPileDriver> my church as a child claimed pokemon was evil and was the devil's game
[0:24:35] <Prevot> that only works for people who are way less hardcore religious than woolies mom
[0:24:37] <dekkitout> I found out years later my mom was huge into Hellboy
[0:24:38] <+inktoxicant> gaming is devilry
[0:24:40] <%Visorak6> it's about the content even being there
[0:24:41] <%Th3SmartAlec> FROM MY
[0:24:43] <cipher758> Father Woolie at it again
[0:24:44] <%tearfuldevil> rememebr when harry potter was devil worship
[0:24:46] <%zanzibar_junker> I've watching Vtubers stream Doom 64
[0:24:48] <%DaBigVitus> Idle Hands!
[0:24:49] <%Fattness132> Video games = witchcraft = evil
[0:24:49] <user_naim> Aren‚Äôt gnostic ideas heresy anyways?
[0:24:51] <HeroToxiko> any devil at all = no LUL
[0:24:51] <Jontman42> it's about depicting the devil to begin with
[0:24:57] <%tearfuldevil> tbf harry potter is garbo but thats urnelated
[0:25:02] <+Lightning_Bolt_Action> ban video g*mes
[0:25:03] <1nuttery> Polygons = Satan
[0:25:04] <%Ashenik1> ITs showing how devil things are cool
[0:25:05] <%tearfuldevil> @user_naim yes
[0:25:06] <%GodsAndHumans> Doom is THE wholesome christian experience.
[0:25:08] <@akuda_bar> Look, why would you choose to play Doom when you could play Farmer Bob's Bible Ark Zoo Race Game
[0:25:09] <ScreamLord> That's stupid
[0:25:11] <%trustycoyote> Literally judging the game for the gameplay. I mean if anything she's judging games properly LUL
[0:25:11] <+eanscrale> Lucifer just wants freedom for humanity
[0:25:13] <+inktoxicant> you're doing violence and that means you're with the devil
[0:25:16] <+VidulaSaix> Is that what your mom told you or what you think she sees it at, cause I can promise you thats not how my mom sees it LUL
[0:25:18] <%CaptainPileDriver> again, the church we went to when i was like 5-6 claimed pokemon was the devil's game cause it involved monsters
[0:25:18] <$GoogleyGareth> LUL
[0:25:19] <PleasantLeech> is Satan really that bad?
[0:25:20] <Pookiedaexzile> Don't try logic with religious works
[0:25:22] <HeroToxiko> i remember religious fosters burning my pokemon cards LUL
[0:25:22] <%Superbro64> people who dont have christian parents clearly have NO IDEA how this works
[0:25:23] <%punch_ghost> So it's the actual imagery itself rather than the context in which it's used
[0:25:24] <thelonechris> Doomguy is basically Jesus
[0:25:25] <GoldeNOVA> The bible makes the demons look cool tho
[0:25:26] <Pookiedaexzile> It usually doesn't work out that welll
[0:25:26] <+TheOneCalledRock> @WoolieVersus it's the fact that it includes the demonic images so hard is the issue
[0:25:27] <%McSoliace> if you have a heavily religious family the mind games have to get absurd
[0:25:28] <ghostspartan80> doom is about destroying the devil so...
[0:25:29] <+eanscrale> Nah man, Satan is cool
[0:25:34] <%GeneralSCPatton> The concept of the god that is worshipped actually being an evil false god that must be overthrown would probably be considered the worst heresy.
[0:25:39] <$GoogleyGareth> @HeroToxiko fuckin hell lol

[0:26:00] <%Th3SmartAlec> @generalscpatton
[0:26:03] <thorn0516> the problem isn't that the devil is the enemy, its that you are forced to engage so heavily and directly with demons and the denizens of hell

[0:45:13] <J87_fox> maybe turn down the brightness?
[0:45:13] <%Pigg1yJuffs> Everyone, make sure to inform Woolie when he gets back into the Fortress to put in the code for Doom 2. At least when he gets access to it again.
[0:45:13] <Mike_Mc> Everything is much harder
[0:45:14] <%doomerskeletor13> Melee is significantly weaker in this game
[0:45:15] <BusterRepukken> Melee is a thousand times weaker, dont bother
[0:45:16] <+frankthetank285> melee is worthless don't use it
[0:45:16] <%PR0swagonist> it is so different
[0:45:16] <SyLuX45> Melee got nerfed unless you have a future upgrade

[0:45:19] <Kaji04> bring out the STEAM CONTROLLER
[0:45:19] <raveous> oh nice you can change difficulty here
[0:45:19] <valriot> Melee got kicked out of Balance EVO
[0:45:20] <+FackinCrazy> Too bad Mick turned out to be kind of a dick who blames others when he misses multiple deadline that he agreed too
[0:45:21] <staticshock5> Melee got hard nerfed
[0:45:22] <+Lightning_Bolt_Action> the controller aim begins
[0:45:23] <+DesertPenguin> Yea, don't melee
[0:45:23] <ihateyouo> aim assist OFF
[0:45:23] <+mechslayer71> Check your aim accelaration @woolieversus
[0:45:25] <+linSP> the nerfed melee made me drop the game honestly
[0:45:28] <%Solidnick18> smoilers
[0:45:28] <$GabeSweetMan> Quick woolie, use your awful control scheme!
[0:45:29] <+D00msDayDan> @BusterRepukken it's not just weaker, it straight up does no damage
[0:45:30] <sunwraith91> Melee nerfed hard
[0:45:31] <Mr_Rakjo> @optimasmaximas unless there is a FrankerFaceZ thing i cannot see where the section are

[0:45:32] <+CoronetChris> woolieYE
[0:45:34] <Pookiedaexzile> Melee is no longer a Viable option
[0:45:34] <+DesertPenguin> Melee is not for fodder enemies anymore
[0:45:36] <PleasantLeech> Melee cannot kill, it only stuns
[0:45:37] <%shradke> too bad id changed their deal with Mick past the work he was required to do
[0:45:37] <Lightraven_> spoiled
[0:45:38] <%CommanderSqueaks> By the way, the start of the game is VERY Tutorial heavy, it tells you pretty much everything
[0:45:41] <+Mkingston> So many buttons to learn in Eternal. Did it on keyboard. Was nuts.
[0:45:41] <Agami23> some isnt usable until later
[0:45:42] <randominternetsurfer> @fackincrazy Mick didn't blame anyone.
[0:45:43] <%paladinstarbuster> BIG SPOILS
[0:45:43] <staticshock5> @linsp Really?

[0:46:03] <+DesertPenguin> UAC is a nice Matrix style
[0:46:03] <HollowDragon231> uac
[0:46:04] <%DensityD> green is not a creative color
[0:46:05] <%trustycoyote> Default aint bad
[0:46:08] <%Javaa01> Default has the best visibility on UI elements
[0:46:09] <%optimasmaximas> purple and blue Kreygasm
[0:46:09] <+Shikari21> uac is cool

[0:47:25] <%gatorafan> @jack8274 this is PS4 apparently
[0:47:26] <+TheOneCalledRock> does the console version have FOV sliders?
[0:47:27] <+WordsHere> Oops. Forgot watching people play an FPS with a controller makes me sick. Bye
[0:47:30] <%Mrthefro> Its on ps4
[0:47:34] <%CommanderSqueaks> Man, some of the chat here is actually the worse.
[0:47:35] <%doomerskeletor13> The map will show you any secrets
[0:47:36] <+fizzguy47> @theonecalledrock yes
[0:47:37] <PleasantLeech> map is so much better in this
[0:47:38] <+mechslayer71> @theonecalledrock Yes
[0:47:38] <RunningNGunning> Can you change FOV on PS4?
[0:47:42] <+FackinCrazy> @shradke they change3d the deal by extending his deadline twice and still giving him his bonus if he hits the new deadline. they wanted 12 songs with another bonus if he does more
[0:47:44] <randominternetsurfer> @busterrepukken you can still set the FOV to 100/Max on Console.
[0:47:44] <+mechslayer71> Yes you can
[0:47:47] <Josef_Stryker> Shotgun into an AA12
[0:47:48] <+l3sovikk> sticky bombs are bae
[0:47:54] <petwisk> get the sticky bombs
[0:47:55] <+Truebluemc> yep you can change fov
[0:47:56] <thelonechris> YEYEYE
[0:47:56] <%WanderingSwordsman> don't worry about cleaning up to you reach the end of the level
[0:47:57] <+VidulaSaix> YEYEYEYE
[0:47:58] <$GabeSweetMan> The amount of options on PS4 are impressive gonna be honest.
[0:48:00] <reclllegitlogic> there is a secret back
[0:48:01] <%Solidnick18> skin your ass raw
[0:48:01] <%ChoculaUltra> I don't mean to sound like a PC elitist, but what is the reason exactly that most PC games don't have FOV sliders whereas their PC counterparts do?
[0:48:02] <+inktoxicant> your ammo button
[0:48:02] <MayorRev> START TO CHAINSAW
[0:48:02] <%Javaa01> @RunningNGunning Yes, you can adjust FOV up to I think 100 or 110 on the console versions
[0:48:05] <DeathByPoke7> to training mode
[0:48:06] <Jack8274> TRAINING ROOM
[0:48:07] <+CoronetChris> Right, I forgot the motion sickness... I'll just have to deal.
[0:48:09] <%shradke> lol @ the mouse elitist, good riddance
[0:48:11] <shotgang86> get used to it
[0:48:11] <%ChoculaUltra> *console games
[0:48:12] <%jarednotwithsubway> skin your ASS RAW!!!
[0:48:13] <+prime_name> Chainsaw is reload
[0:48:16] <%RadicalWeegee> Chainsaww is ammo box
[0:48:23] <%optimasmaximas> @Mr_Rakjo went to pat's to experiment, it's the same where you just click on the videos tab, and just scroll till you find the recent broadcasts section; unless you're on mobile? is that where the problem is?
[0:48:24] <KillMyPast> Chainsaw is mandatory
[0:48:25] <+Razputin217> Reload button Unlocked
[0:48:28] <%jinking79> gonna be a min before we get to the one real fight
[0:48:31] <+RyTYoung> once shit gets wild, get ready to button map Kappa
[0:48:33] <%doomerskeletor13> Chainsaw is essential
[0:48:33] <PleasantLeech> it's just the reload button
[0:48:34] <%GeneralSCPatton> YOU REGENERATE ONE FUEL IF YOU ARE EMPTY
[0:48:35] <%J0RD4NPR1M3> Cheer500 The director of thr game recommends that you set grenade switch to the L3 since the game expects to switch grenades often
[0:48:35] <%DianaTheAscian> that last line is important
[0:48:36] <raveous> yeah chainsaw is core to the gameplay this time
[0:48:37] <@akuda_bar> @ChoculaUltra interesting answer: you normally play games from the couch and the FOV setting is meant to adjust whether you are on your couch or at a desk
[0:48:38] <+DakotaMacDoodle> this is the reload button use it often
[0:48:40] <ralphfromdk> Chainsaw is very different now, it's a must, compared to 2016 where it was a bit more of a super weapon
[0:48:47] <+Comradeiota> important note: the first pip of fuel recharges.
[0:48:47] <$GabeSweetMan> It's JUST your ammo replenishment.
[0:48:48] <%ChoculaUltra> @akuda_bar ah that makes sense
[0:48:51] <invader_rin> It's your reload button
[0:48:51] <+FreddyLeeSavage> chainsaw is a reload button
[0:48:54] <+RyTYoung> Very nice addition
[0:48:54] <RunningNGunning> You're gonna need the free fuel
[0:48:55] <%StaceMcGate> Chainsaw is a must now
[0:48:56] <Darren716> You get 1 pip for free
[0:48:56] <%DianaTheAscian> @WoolieVersus U GET 1 FUEL
[0:48:57] <cipher758> indeed
[0:48:57] <%doomerskeletor13> It‚Äôs more or less a reload button
[0:48:58] <LoganPayne> pity fuel
[0:49:00] <MayorRev> ?
[0:49:00] <+fizzguy47> 1 pip only
[0:49:00] <Jack8274> It's literally used every 30 seconds now
[0:49:02] <%Javaa01> @WoolieVersus You only ever hold the chainsaw exclusively when you have ZERO ammo on any of your weapons
[0:49:04] <Louie_Salmon> It works exactly like the Deus ex battery
[0:49:04] <%Zebroneath> Deus Ex HR rules on chainsaw fuel
[0:49:05] <shotgang86> Its literally a weapon refill there is less ammo around
[0:49:05] <%Solidnick18> secrets PogChamp
[0:49:06] <+Lizard0TM> No, on 1 poip fills
[0:49:06] <Mr_Rakjo> @optimasmaximas hmm yeah its probably a BTTV
[0:49:07] <+VidulaSaix> Yeah its basically a fancy reload that kills
[0:49:08] <$GabeSweetMan> Mooks are reduced on higher difficulties so you can't replenish ammo as easily.
[0:49:09] <+Lizard0TM> pip
[0:49:11] <+mechslayer71> One pip
[0:49:11] <LoganPayne> Deus Ex HR battery chainsaw
[0:49:12] <+inktoxicant> the weapons that aren't your guns become resource management
[0:49:14] <jeosadn> "don't have to worry about ammo" bwahahaha
[0:49:16] <Iwashi94> @WoolieVersus you have way less ammo compared to 2016
[0:49:17] <MayorRev> LUNCHABLE PUNCHABLE
[0:49:19] <sunwraith91> the wall
[0:49:20] <StonerStan101> @WoolieVersus Doomguy armor with Dreads, does that make him a human Predator?
[0:49:21] <+inktoxicant> i think it's a great system tbh
[0:49:21] <dekkitout> Get ready to spin some plates with all the drop dynamics
[0:49:21] <%WanderingSwordsman> can only regen one pip
[0:49:22] <+CryptusMaximus> You only get ONE pip for free, you have to stack the rest with pick ups
[0:49:24] <Darren716> GET THE WALL
[0:49:24] <%optimasmaximas> @Mr_Rakjo nah, it's just standard twitch
[0:49:26] <sunwraith91> the allll
[0:49:29] <invader_rin> Secrets
[0:49:32] <%GeneralSCPatton> ONLY THE LAST PIP REFILLS

[0:49:36] <AppleBoi85> look at the cages
[0:49:39] <+RyTYoung> Whoever said the platforming in Doom Eternal is unnecessary is lyinggg
[0:49:41] <+handfulofslugs> wall secret
[0:49:42] <%vextalyst> cheer500 OK I'd like to just point out I'm black and Alex just really reminds me of Reggie. With that out the way I feel your frustration on the sign in BS. Like 12 Years ago i argued with my brother about one day having to sign into 7 launchers just to play and he laughed in my face. It sucks to be right.

[0:51:24] <%Solidnick18> sticky bombs
[0:51:24] <Shishi1205> No abusing best boy
[0:51:24] <DedlokPM> sadly no. doodSad
[0:51:25] <sunwraith91> Nah it's vega man
[0:51:26] <@akuda_bar> @CommanderSqueaks that's how you communicate telepathically to woolie right
[0:51:27] <NobleHeart92> STICKY BOMBS
[0:51:31] <+mechslayer71> Sticky bombs
[0:51:32] <@akuda_bar> @Jack8274 he doesn't read chat while he is recording
[0:51:33] <%alpacasintophats> stickys
[0:51:34] <sunwraith91> STICKY BOMBS
[0:51:36] <+Razputin217> Sticky Icky
[0:51:37] <revoltingimp> @CommanderSqueaks AYE AYE COMMANDER!
[0:51:38] <+fizzguy47> bots are shaped like friends nows
[0:51:39] <%WanderingSwordsman> sticky bombs
[0:51:42] <PleasantLeech> both are good but sticky has more utility
[0:51:45] <%DensityD> wooliePOYO
[0:51:45] <%GeneralSCPatton> Sticky
[0:51:45] <%ChoculaUltra> grasp it firmly
[0:51:47] <raveous> the alternative to sticky bombs has been bad in both games
[0:51:47] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1260094696292048899
[0:51:47] <%DensityD> woolieLORE
[0:51:49] <alexandrecau> full auto looks rad but impractical
[0:51:50] <petwisk> get Sticky bombs
[0:51:51] <Jack8274> @akuda_bar I have to wait for Reggie to get aggitaed then
[0:51:51] <Darren716> I legit never used full auto
[0:51:52] <$GabeSweetMan> Sticky probably more helpful for ya Woolie.
[0:51:52] <PeteyMcPickle> Get a bigger/closer TV woolie
[0:51:53] <+RyTYoung> @commandersqueaks I mean it works, and I'm guilty for joining the angry mob too. LUL
[0:51:55] <eckskyuucow> Full Auto is fuckng worthless
[0:51:57] <+linSP> Why‚Äôd they downgrade the grenade launcher smh
[0:51:59] <%DianaTheAscian> do sticky, auto looks cooler but sticky is more usefull
[0:51:59] <ralphfromdk> Bombs only use 1 ammo per use. It's so worth it
[0:51:59] <Pookiedaexzile> woolies a contrian say the oppisite thing or he's gonna go full auto
[0:51:59] <chikensandwich> are you enjoying dmc 6?
[0:52:06] <Bodregg> @WoolieVersus stickybombs are more universally useful, but full auto can put out WAY higher DPS and are good against heavyweight demons you meet past this mission
[0:52:06] <+Mkingston> Sticky bombs are a must
[0:52:07] <Darren716> Full auto just wastes your ammo
[0:52:10] <+l3sovikk> sticky bombs
[0:52:17] <%Javaa01> You don't have the ammo capacity to use full auto yet
[0:52:18] <scrumbotime> Fast Feet, the one reggie wants
[0:52:18] <+l3sovikk> nononono
[0:52:18] <%D4C_Trice> auto eats ammo so fast
[0:52:19] <%GeneralSCPatton> STICKY IS BEST
[0:52:19] <%DianaTheAscian> welp
[0:52:20] <%gunsrlove> its ok chat let him choose
[0:52:20] <+Lizard0TM> I wouldn't
[0:52:21] <thorn0516> full auto is pretty good but later in the game imo
[0:52:21] <%Brightstreak> oh no
[0:52:21] <%optimasmaximas> @Mr_Rakjo huh, weird, i have bttv and frankerz as extensions, maybe it's just a glitch with twitch on your end for some reason? how long has it been that way?
[0:52:22] <Darren716> Sticky is amazing
[0:52:23] <eckskyuucow> STICKY BOMBS
[0:52:23] <Shishi1205> Sticky is better but you will see
[0:52:23] <%StaceMcGate> you have chosen...poorly
[0:52:23] <+slimmixrp> NO
[0:52:25] <+slimmixrp> BOMBS
[0:52:26] <+VidulaSaix> Chat let him pick what he wants holy fucking shit
[0:52:26] <RunningNGunning> Either is fine for now
[0:52:27] <SteinsApprentice> Doom eternal?! Yesssss
[0:52:28] <%Irridium> I went with full auto it worked just fine
[0:52:29] <%kapcommunist> plx dont woolie its important for arachnotrons
[0:52:29] <n3ls1s> STICKY BOBM
[0:52:30] <+RyTYoung> Go bomba
[0:52:30] <revoltingimp> he's gonna get both before it becomes important anyway, fucking stop
[0:52:30] <+inktoxicant> don't punch the vega bots
[0:52:30] <%Brightstreak> sticky bomb almost essential
[0:52:31] <eckskyuucow> Saved
[0:52:31] <thorn0516> sticky bombs are really good early game
[0:52:31] <%mrlastchance1> thank god
[0:52:31] <Jack8274> Full auto sucks until the final perk
[0:52:31] <%paladinstarbuster> do what you want
[0:52:32] <Pookiedaexzile> LUL LUL
[0:52:32] <%gatorafan> it fine :)
[0:52:32] <SainEdge> its a Vega drone now, so no punching
[0:52:33] <+mechslayer71> Sticky bomb
[0:52:33] <+l3sovikk> Yeyeye
[0:52:34] <MasterTonberry23> It's about time you got to this Darlington
[0:52:34] <badknight007> sticky is op
[0:52:34] <%doomerskeletor13> You don‚Äôt punch it cause it‚Äôs Vega now
[0:52:35] <CrimsonFox777> Chat, let Woolie fail if he wants.
[0:52:35] <Darren716> Sticky is a straight damage upgrade
[0:52:36] <+Comradeiota> auto is good later. sticky is good now.
[0:52:36] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[0:52:36] <%b_aleph> fast FEET. Reggie approves
[0:52:37] <raveous> it's fun, but you only get to use full auto for 3 seconds before you run out of ammo
[0:52:37] <GoldeNOVA> Shut up and let him play, chat
[0:52:40] <user_naim> LP never ruined
[0:52:40] <dustworthmain> yall sleeping on full auto
[0:52:41] <Bodregg> the full auto will eat your ammo for breakfast, but the damage is worth it against stuff like barons and mancubi @WoolieVersus
[0:52:43] <%DensityD> u shut up
[0:52:43] <GarbageNirvana> Bombs are better for right now ye
[0:52:44] <thelonechris> I like how he doesn't punch the VEGA drones
[0:52:45] <BlackermanZX> full auto kinda eats ammo early game
[0:52:50] <snakest3alth> No more punching
[0:52:50] <+mechslayer71> Have fun with your no ammo
[0:52:51] <SyLuX45> Full auto is better for later when there Heavy enemies
[0:52:51] <$GabeSweetMan> There's PLENTY of extra upgrades to max out.
[0:52:51] <%DaBigVitus> unless......
[0:52:52] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @heart_ablaze
[0:52:54] <+fizzguy47> sticky is more useful early game
[0:52:55] <RunningNGunning> Chat, theres a second pickup literally 2 rooms from now, relax
[0:52:57] <NobleHeart92> full auto eats through ammo too fast at beginning
[0:53:01] <Shishi1205> he gets another one in 10 minutes
[0:53:07] <%StaceMcGate> Woolie ignores chat until he wants something from us
[0:53:09] <Pookiedaexzile> Shut up and let us chat Chat
[0:53:10] <user_naim> Put us in emote only
[0:53:11] <resloxxx> @WoolieVersus Fast travel is at the end of the level so you can play the map and worry at the end about looking for secrets and collectibles
[0:53:11] <+prime_name> Its very easy to max stuff out in this game
[0:53:11] <andrei11dr> The game gives you both anyway
[0:53:13] <MasterTonberry23> @GoldeNOVA "Woolie should always listen to chat and never make a decision himself" -People in chat, probably
[0:53:16] <Louie_Salmon> But what if they way he wants to play is the wrong way
[0:53:26] <Darren716> You get 3 shots
[0:53:28] <%Javaa01> Recharge is like 5 seconds per shot
[0:53:28] <+handfulofslugs> It uses ammo, no recharge
[0:53:31] <%PR0swagonist> its a toggle woolie
[0:53:32] <revoltingimp> Suggestion for chat: discuss the game instead of backseating
[0:53:35] <sunwraith91> As long as you go tammo
[0:53:36] <%Solidnick18> imp
[0:53:38] <+RyTYoung> Never stop chatting, chat
[0:53:38] <andrei11dr> It's so weird to see those guys get killed with one shot
[0:53:45] <+mechslayer71> You get 3 at a time
[0:53:46] <+Comradeiota> another important note: melee on its own does no damage!
[0:53:46] <%doomerskeletor13> You can do it as long as you have ammo
[0:53:48] <$GabeSweetMan> THE BEST ONE
[0:53:49] <vVAstrAVv> whoolie! why arent you playing the exact same way ive seen before!
[0:53:50] <@akuda_bar> purple chat, assemble
[0:53:52] <%DianaTheAscian> Shut up and play chat
[0:53:53] <%Solidnick18> YEYEYE

[0:54:34] <Reveresao> WHAAAAAAAAAATT!?!?!!
[0:54:35] <Darren716> You got the loop down
[0:54:36] <+That_Marcus_Dude> @WoolieVersus Use the sticky like your primary until you need to recharge
[0:54:37] <%MyNameIsRasus> Purple chat is the coolest guy!
[0:54:38] <Bodregg> he's doing the thing!
[0:54:39] <Reveresao> DOOM
[0:54:41] <Thetruestblacksun> This is going surprisingly better than I thought
[0:54:48] <vibezbott> Someone whisper me
[0:54:49] <revoltingimp> By our purple combined, We are CHAT!
[0:54:50] <%DianaTheAscian> okay this may be fine
[0:54:51] <+InsaneJackLondon> RIP AND CHAT
[0:54:51] <Jack8274> Oh Reggie dont tease me
[0:54:51] <resloxxx> Purple or grape purple?
[0:54:51] <+inktoxicant> where you point the camera changes the kill and I love that
[0:54:52] <DynamicMenace_> any purple chatters?
[0:54:54] <%doomerskeletor13> There are a lot but some are hard to get
[0:54:54] <Pookiedaexzile> Reggie what
[0:54:55] <BusterRepukken> console aim is rough
[0:54:57] <+aishman> @WoolieVersus Don't forget to CHAINSAW
[0:54:58] <+projectmanatees> RIP AND TEAR
[0:55:03] <%StaceMcGate> @optimasmaximas Somewhat, but the people screaming "let him play as he wants" as just as ignorant as the backseaters and just as annoying
[0:55:04] <Bodregg> this analog stick aiming though
[0:55:06] <Funky_Honkey> dude this "aim"
[0:55:07] <+johnny_gogo> This game is going to kick your asss
[0:55:12] <%PR0swagonist> Are we the fabled?
[0:55:17] <+johnny_gogo> and its going to be so fun
[0:55:22] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Mouse and Keyboard Woolz plz
[0:55:22] <andrei11dr> Looking at this now, this feels so slow LUL
[0:55:22] <%Nekros4442> Yeah maybe it was a good idea to pick normal
[0:55:23] <MayorRev> Purple chat supreme
[0:55:24] <$GabeSweetMan> Hurt me Plenty is the right difficulty for Woolie for sure.
[0:55:27] <MasterTonberry23> Surprised Woolie hasnt blown himself up with a rocket yet. I am aware he does not yet has one, but I'm sure he can find a way
[0:55:28] <Lancaster_H> Why does he refuse to gain more power?
[0:55:29] <tactician0> What is aim for 400
[0:55:30] <turbofolk> Man woolie how your systme working out for you?
[0:55:33] <+mechslayer71> People wanted this on UV Kappa
[0:55:33] <%DianaTheAscian> yes
[0:55:34] <+RyTYoung> Purps
[0:55:35] <PleasantLeech> I think normal was the right choice for him
[0:55:35] <GoldeNOVA> Doomguy is too angry to look down the sights, its canon
[0:55:35] <%Fattness132> Controller aim is painful :(
[0:55:35] <%optimasmaximas> @StaceMcGate i was joking just clarify,but i agree with what you juist said
[0:55:36] <resloxxx> He is doing way better than when he started the first one
[0:55:37] <masterfire23> time to get back into the cube LUL
[0:55:40] <ralphfromdk> This is a game that could benefit from the mouse and joypad combo.
[0:55:42] <vstpnv> !motivated
[0:55:42] <@Moobot> 1117 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[0:55:44] <Jack8274> LUL

[0:55:49] <Josef_Stryker> Dat aim tho
[0:55:52] <+TheBigTaco> LUL
[0:55:53] <Bodregg> i think it's time for the gamer cube
[0:55:54] <KillMyPast> Wait a second
[0:55:56] <+bluebreadtoons> lol woolie landing 2 out of every 10 shots
[0:55:57] <KillMyPast> Wheres the music?
[0:55:58] <raveous> he would have just had to evolve a little
[0:56:01] <%optimasmaximas> "HE'S A CONTROLLA PLAYA"
[0:56:04] <%DianaTheAscian> maybe not
[0:56:04] <MKII> he can always turn up the difficulty
[0:56:06] <tactician0> @fattness132 this woolie aim not controller
[0:56:07] <MayorRev> !motivated
[0:56:07] <@Moobot> 1118 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[0:56:08] <ghostspartan80> yeah uv would be too hard
[0:56:08] <Jack8274> He's Warming up guys
[0:56:12] <BusterRepukken> and you guys wanted him to play UV
[0:56:15] <+Mkingston> Pat used a controller too
[0:56:16] <%GeneralSCPatton> @raveous LUL LUL LUL
[0:56:16] <%Garthunox> so you guys wanted UV yeah?
[0:56:17] <+JingKaisean> you don't get a lot of ammo in this game
[0:56:20] <Shishi1205> Maybe its better for woolie to not paly ultra
[0:56:21] <resloxxx> Will we see the chimera in this LP?
[0:56:21] <MayorRev> Purple poggers squad PogChamp
[0:56:21] <andrei11dr> Oh boy, those Marauder fights are going to be rough

[0:56:25] <ihateyouo> there's nothing
[0:56:27] <PleasantLeech> I thought he was a pro gamer
[0:56:31] <darthriven501> i cannot wait for him to get to level 2
[0:56:32] <%PR0swagonist> maybe we're in the right spot all along
[0:56:35] <%alpacasintophats> those fights are rough in general
[0:56:36] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Why tf is health white??
[0:56:40] <+mechslayer71> People actually wanted UV like woolie knows what he‚Äôs doing LUL
[0:56:42] <+johnny_gogo> 2016 is baby shit
[0:56:43] <+VidulaSaix> Big whiffs. Gotta warm up indeed LUL
[0:56:43] <+TheBigTaco> @MKII considering he can barely hit shots, I think this difficulty is fine
[0:56:44] <Lancaster_H> Use a fightstick that'll help maybe
[0:56:45] <%Javaa01> Nope, no secrets
[0:56:45] <Shishi1205> Always check map to see if there's something @WoolieVersus
[0:56:45] <+Lizard0TM> Nothing wrong with Controller, Woolie is just... not as dextrous I guess
[0:56:47] <jayopai> I'm just thinking about them slayer gates
[0:56:52] <%Javaa01> The swords just mean FIGHT ROOM
[0:56:52] <%DianaTheAscian> its a med pack
[0:56:53] <%horse_oil> its gonna get spicy
[0:56:53] <masterfire23> this game is a lot faster than 2016 LUL

[0:58:06] <Louie_Salmon> @lizard0tm It's the same problem Japanese players have, where they didn't have games with two sticks for a long time, and never got used to it. It's why DQ11 has buttons for turning the camera
[0:58:08] <+maenos2> vision reminded me of the prothean visions in mass effect, just not as meaty.

[1:01:36] <Kaji04> Jump off
[1:01:37] <%R3Roundabout> Chat is half bitching, half bitching about bitching
[1:01:39] <%Brightstreak> secrets appear on map.
[1:01:42] <yash_lawman> bye nerf
[1:01:44] <Shishi1205> Just check the Map for secrets, is easier here
[1:01:45] <raveous> secrets show up on the map in a fairly large proximity in this game, so as far as secret searching goes, you don't have to be super thorough
[1:01:49] <%WutangchickeN> @woolieversus the map will be extremely explicit when there are secrets.
[1:01:50] <%doomerskeletor13> Any secretes will show up on the map
[1:01:51] <Bodregg> oh god i can already tell that the gore nest mission will take hours
[1:01:55] <%Javaa01> You don't need to tag all gray
[1:01:59] <+Corporate_Redeemer> @r3roundabout Such is the duality of the Twitch chay
[1:02:04] <Reveresao> GO UP
[1:02:07] <$GabeSweetMan> While it's definitely better that Woolie selected this difficulty for the sake of our sanity, we still reserve the right to call him a coward for not selecting Ultra Violence.
[1:02:13] <Darren716> You get an upgrade pretty early thatll show you all the secrets
[1:02:15] <Bodregg> secrets aren't very secret in this one
[1:02:15] <%Javaa01> Now look at the map
[1:02:15] <+YabbaTroll> @Bodregg yo the soundtrack on that level though
[1:02:16] <RunningNGunning> Ammo gone

[1:03:26] <%Drchandragupta> Full auto's rad don't be a coward
[1:03:28] <megamonmon123> let him play the fucking game
[1:03:28] <Bodregg> woolie doesn't know how bad it is Kappa
[1:03:34] <%wunp_fxs> jeez chat, ravinous today
[1:03:34] <+That_Marcus_Dude> @Chester_goes_Berserk You know the answer to that
[1:03:34] <Mister_McDerp> full auto doesn't suck
[1:03:35] <Shishi1205> BIG MECHA
[1:03:39] <megamonmon123> jesus christ
[1:03:39] <%FuqBoiSlim> TYBR: Thank You Based Regg
[1:03:40] <BlackermanZX> The demons need help
[1:03:41] <andrei11dr> I love that one LUL
[1:03:42] <MONSTR_UwU> save them from themselves
[1:03:44] <%DianaTheAscian> @Chester_goes_Berserk they barely read it anyway
[1:03:46] <%ChoculaUltra> its fine, they don't really read chat during LP sessions unless its a break in-between sync tests.
[1:03:50] <%tearfuldevil> @Chester_goes_Berserk no, but also he doens't look at chat msot of the time cause spoilers, so who cares anwyays?
[1:03:50] <%Brightstreak> lies though, because both sides are demons
[1:03:51] <%CommanderSqueaks> Reggie, whatever you do, don't look at Chat, it's a garbage pit right now.
[1:03:52] <%kapcommunist> melee is super weak this game
[1:03:53] <cheesedburgers> Prepare for titanfa- oh
[1:03:53] <PleasantLeech> none of the mods suck
[1:03:54] <%emperordread> Like that Barney in black mesa getting killed behind the gate LUL
[1:03:58] <+Lizard0TM> Woolie peek them mechs tho
[1:03:58] <thelonechris> They're walking ammo packs
[1:04:00] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> @That_Marcus_Dude Dang
[1:04:09] <sunwraith91> read the lore!
[1:04:09] <MONSTR_UwU> BOP
[1:04:12] <+mechslayer71> @mister_mcderp Early on it does. Very ammo inefficient next to sticky bombs
[1:04:13] <%Javaa01> Infighting has been a part of the series since 1993
[1:04:14] <%doomerskeletor13> Fodder demons
[1:04:17] <Shishi1205> Melee is garbo btw
[1:04:17] <Pookiedaexzile> Who wants to take bets
[1:04:19] <alexandrecau> demons just like fighting each other
[1:04:20] <ofalconer> Infighting is a classic Doom element
[1:04:20] <valriot> Theyre just stupid
[1:04:21] <+aceleapc> Big time getting to see who's actually good in chat based on who's saying full auto is good
[1:04:22] <Pookiedaexzile> on if he misses the mechs
[1:04:24] <%paladinstarbuster> humans always fight demans until they see you
[1:04:24] <RunningNGunning> fine out is the LORE episodes
[1:04:30] <%doomerskeletor13> The lore explains it
[1:04:31] <$SilverRoddo> These were humans that played them Devil Games!
[1:04:31] <%gunsrlove> Big mech
[1:04:33] <+TheBigTaco> Stop complaining about the people complaining. Now i'm complaining about the poeple complaining about the people who are complaining. See what you've done?
[1:04:34] <Bodregg> full auto is niche but still useful, it's really good at pumping damage on big things like mancubi and knights before you get the really big guns
[1:04:35] <ghostspartan80> demons fight each other way more often in this game
[1:04:41] <+YabbaTroll> mech dick
[1:04:43] <Bodregg> nowhere near as bad as the microwave beam
[1:04:46] <PleasantLeech> possessed fight demons and big demons like to bully small demons
[1:04:46] <%FuqBoiSlim> dont bother with melee, it's useless in this game ‚ò†
[1:04:50] <cheap_turbo> you think he'll notice?
[1:04:51] <MasterTonberry23> My thought is that the demons dont like each other much, but when Doomguy shows up they pull it together and team up
[1:04:51] <+Taglog7> Woolie Eternal
[1:04:51] <Mister_McDerp> @mechslayer71 I know, its for using on bosses and tougher enemies
[1:04:53] <thelonechris> Demons hate everything, including each other
[1:04:55] <andrei11dr> Sam is like, 8 hours away
[1:04:56] <pede2011> here we go bois
[1:04:56] <%LeaIsChill> This enemy HURTS
[1:04:57] <Reveresao> Woolie goona die here
[1:04:58] <RunningNGunning> SourPls inc
[1:04:59] <%Th3SmartAlec> bye mech
[1:05:00] <alexandrecau> doomguy of persia
[1:05:00] <%Irridium> not entirely, melee does stagger some enemies which helps
[1:05:01] <%paladinstarbuster> you werent strapped in you were teleported
[1:05:02] <Who_lio42> samuel hayden and his resooooooooooolve
[1:05:03] <%tearfuldevil> death time
[1:05:05] <Jack8274> THE GAME BEGINS
[1:05:06] <Shishi1205> Sam is longer than 8
[1:05:09] <ghostspartan80> sticky bomb is key
[1:05:09] <raveous> hearing that *ding* when you hit a weak point is just Kreygasm
[1:05:10] <coreybom> Sam is a while off bois.
[1:05:16] <Reveresao> death coming for you woolie
[1:05:18] <THELava_lad> LOOK GIANT ROBOT
[1:05:18] <%Javaa01> READ THE CODEX, IT IS VITAL
[1:05:19] <%DianaTheAscian> remember that this one especially
[1:05:21] <RunningNGunning> SourPls SourPls
[1:05:23] <Pookiedaexzile> Maybe we shouldn't say that
[1:05:23] <%Solidnick18> Oh shit
[1:05:26] <cheesedburgers> Wish they didn‚Äôt tell you how to kill an enemy before you see it
[1:05:26] <MayorRev> baby mode
[1:05:26] <%Solidnick18> SourPls
[1:05:28] <VJdarkworld> boss baby
[1:05:28] <Iwashi94> if only the game let you figure this out youself
[1:05:32] <+inktoxicant> battle arena time
[1:05:32] <BlackermanZX> IT BEGINS
[1:05:34] <%kapcommunist> its grenades have a radius tho
[1:05:35] <MasterTonberry23> Sorta like House of the Dead, telling you the weak points
[1:05:36] <%FuqBoiSlim> Baby Mastermind uwu
[1:05:38] <thelonechris> Spooder
[1:05:39] <%Brightstreak> Just some context, creative director Hugo Martin has more or less said that he envisions doom guy being a Jesus.
[1:05:40] <ralphfromdk> That moment when the last boss is just a normal enemy in the sequal :D
[1:05:44] <%StaceMcGate> Reminder you'll never hear Mick Gordon in DOOM ever again after this game
[1:05:49] <RunningNGunning> None in level 1

[1:06:33] <$GabeSweetMan> Oh yeah point blank shotgun misses. This is the Woolie I know and love.
[1:06:35] <+mechslayer71> Yeah, he totally shoulda played on UV guys
[1:06:35] <pede2011> what difficulty?
[1:06:39] <ghostspartan80> just a tip chainsaw is the only way for ammo drops
[1:06:42] <invader_rin> Keep moving
[1:06:43] <Jack8274> @pede2011 Norm
[1:06:44] <+DesertPenguin> Never stop going in lol
[1:06:45] <Shishi1205> Abuse stickys
[1:06:47] <%StaceMcGate> Yeah normal was the right choice
[1:06:49] <Pookiedaexzile> Maybe he should go down a level or two
[1:06:50] <$SilverRoddo> PogChamp PogChamp
[1:06:50] <%DaBigVitus> stream is really stuttery for me. anybody else?
[1:06:54] <DedlokPM> @pede2011 Normal
[1:06:54] <+mechslayer71> HMP @pede2011
[1:06:58] <MasterTonberry23> You get health fast, but you can lose it even faster if youre not careful.
[1:07:04] <Shishi1205> Stream is fine for me
[1:07:04] <%CommanderSqueaks> @dabigvitus Nope, good for me.
[1:07:07] <+DesertPenguin> Sticky Bombs are great because you can be slightly inaccurate but still get the weak enemies with blast damage
[1:07:13] <%StaceMcGate> @DaBigVitus same, I turned down to 720 and am on probably 12 sec delay
[1:07:15] <$laphyrion> TEAR AND RIP
[1:07:17] <%Th3SmartAlec> "You have to HIT them Woolie." Kappa
[1:07:18] <%doomerskeletor13> Gotta be like a Shark in this game. Never stop moving breebuGun
[1:07:19] <%FuqBoiSlim> Never stop going in
[1:07:19] <Mister_McDerp> and people wanted him to play on harder difficulties
[1:07:25] <+phat_gio> atpGasm atpGasm atpGasm
[1:07:26] <+DesertPenguin> LUL
[1:07:31] <%J0RD4NPR1M3> you can punch barrels into demons
[1:07:36] <yash_lawman> NO END JUST RUSH DOWN!!!!
[1:07:41] <pede2011> pfffft, this doesn't bode well then. Oh well, I will just watch the highlights on reddit. Thanks guys
[1:07:43] <Reveresao> Power uos are rere
[1:07:45] <Lancaster_H> I love woolie but this aim actively hurts me
[1:07:46] <DXLelouch24> @WoolieVersus Eternal is WAY harder than 2016, you WILL learn to gitgud
[1:07:46] <+TheBigTaco> yes, they are
[1:07:46] <+aceleapc> they won't stop until you kill the arachnotron
[1:07:47] <$GabeSweetMan> But remember he's still a coward for not selecting UV. He's right. But he's right in his cowardice.
[1:07:48] <Reveresao> rare*
[1:07:48] <coreybom> Everyone is saying how it sucks that game is telling you how to kill the enemy. Quick question, how many of you died constantly to the murarder, or tried to the weak point with a SHIT ton of enemies.
[1:07:48] <Shishi1205> Better to kill the big boys
[1:07:49] <+Mkingston> always take the big enemy out first
[1:07:54] <%Nekros4442> Yeah....this game is about killing big boys first
[1:08:00] <cipher758> RIP AND DONE, UNTIL IT'S TEAR
[1:08:00] <%CommanderSqueaks> This game is like a fighting game where every character is a Rushdown.
[1:08:02] <%tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus hey regge, if you see this. grimts respawn endlessly
[1:08:03] <user_naim> yeyeye
[1:08:03] <MayorRev> PogChamp
[1:08:05] <%DaBigVitus> @StaceMcGate yeah, odd.
[1:08:06] <%jinking79> good thing thier no pistol right
[1:08:07] <+DesertPenguin> After this fight you'll feel good
[1:08:07] <%tearfuldevil> grunt
[1:08:11] <%tearfuldevil> grunts
[1:08:11] <%doomerskeletor13> A lot of fodder enemies will keep respawning so you can get ammo
[1:08:11] <Shishi1205> Ignore smol, focus big
[1:08:11] <%Th3SmartAlec> you did it PogChamp
[1:08:12] <+johnny_gogo> Everyone chill he starting to do good
[1:08:14] <%DensityD> he;s learning
[1:08:16] <+aishman> @WoolieVersus Grunts will always keep respawning since they are your main method to heal and get ammo.
[1:08:16] <Bodregg> @ghostspartan80 not necessarily, it's entirely possible to get all the way to level 6 without using chainsaw once (but with woolie's aim, ammo pickups might as well not exist)
[1:08:19] <Pookiedaexzile> @WoolieVersus Just like boxing Strafe side to side straight back only gets you chased and killed
[1:08:20] <%GeneralSCPatton> ENDLESSLY RESPAWNING ZOMBIES FOR FARMING AMMO/HEALTH
[1:08:21] <Shishi1205> The bigger they are the harder you focus them
[1:08:28] <+DesertPenguin> Devil May Cry door!
[1:08:28] <%Fattness132> fodder endlessly spawn for ammo. THey are basically nobodies
[1:08:29] <playdohface> Spam ur grenades
[1:08:34] <user_naim> he picked up on that fast
[1:08:37] <%Th3SmartAlec> BONK
[1:08:40] <randominternetsurfer> I remember when Max complained about how the game tells you to kill the first boss, and then he died about TWENTY TIMES to the first boss.
[1:08:41] <%optimasmaximas> actual jobbers
[1:08:44] <+ALazo> You mean an infinite well of hp and ammo

[1:08:50] <$GabeSweetMan> The main method of increasing the challenge in higher difficulty is REMOVING the mooks lol.
[1:08:51] <Agami23> walking ammo boxs
[1:08:51] <andrei11dr> There aren't that many berserkers in this, i think I've seen like 3 ,but maybe i just missed them

[1:10:42] <coreybom> @mkingston Like, the messages are to help you out cause the developers KNOW the game isn‚Äôt easy. It‚Äôs like knowing the fundamentals of a fighting game. You know WHEN to punish, but will you do so when it‚Äôs time to do so.

[1:18:53] <+doc_ock_rokc> @coreybom The Dick chefs are almost always softies if you challenge them
[1:18:54] <@akuda_bar> he can't see it
[1:18:58] <+VidulaSaix> Yeah Lore is really meant to be read within the level thos time
[1:18:59] <%Javaa01> @Apollo1818 But they do not count towards level completion, even though you do get the pop up, they are thus NOT required for 100%
[1:19:06] <+mechslayer71> @doc_ock_rokc I worked Mother‚Äôs Day at a red lobster as a Dishwasher. Never again
[1:19:07] <+inktoxicant> they're better than funkos because they don't have soulless dead eyes

[1:27:57] <+That_Marcus_Dude> Guys do you really think recommending precision bolt is a good idea
[1:27:57] <Reveresao> Percision Bolt
[1:28:00] <ppi1993> bolt is godlike this time
[1:28:00] <%xpakeo> Reggie a man himself, has created new lore for DOOM
[1:28:00] <Agami23> the bolt was the last mod i got
[1:28:01] <Jack8274> NERFED AF
[1:28:01] <RunningNGunning> both are gud
[1:28:02] <stanlychicken> both good

[1:28:05] <+RyTYoung> both are winners
[1:28:06] <%FuqBoiSlim> precision is great for weak points
[1:28:06] <KatabolicRage> Precision bolt is a weak point popper
[1:28:07] <%doomerskeletor13> You can‚Äôt go wrong
[1:28:08] <+GeneralHysterics> precision bolt is bae
[1:28:09] <%McSoliace> woolie should not use precision bolt yet
[1:28:10] <+prime_name> Bolt > Missles, but thats just me
[1:28:10] <ppi1993> missles nerfed
[1:28:11] <%Nekros4442> Bolt
[1:28:12] <%Javaa01> Micro Missiles have been somewhat nerfed
[1:28:14] <+Mkingston> Both great
[1:28:14] <Mister_McDerp> missles is better for woolie tho
[1:28:16] <+Kirbachev> Mini missiles are still good.
[1:28:16] <%Solidnick18> the snipe is what you want right now
[1:28:17] <AntifaCatboy> bolt is better
[1:28:18] <%DianaTheAscian> Micro didnt feel as usefull in this one compaerd too 2016
[1:28:18] <+tealplague> bolt
[1:28:19] <+That_Marcus_Dude> Woolie should absolutely use rockets
[1:28:20] <JDebss> That's rad!
[1:28:20] <raveous> precision bult is so good for weak points, which are a big deal in this game
[1:28:21] <+mechslayer71> @prime_name Woolie can‚Äôt aim bro
[1:28:22] <%Irridium> I mean Precision bolt helped me destroy weak points more than sticky bombs, honestly
[1:28:23] <+That_Marcus_Dude> even though bolt is better
[1:28:25] <BusterRepukken> Bolt is cruciasl for weak points
[1:28:26] <ppi1993> ya

[1:28:32] <hassanico2> Good choice!
[1:28:33] <+GeneralHysterics> bolt will help a lot with weakpoints
[1:28:36] <%FuqBoiSlim> They got nerfed but they look so cool woolieSMUG woolieSMUG
[1:28:37] <Shishi1205> Yes
[1:28:38] <%Javaa01> Precision Bolt destroys weakpoints IMMEDIATELY

[1:28:41] <Darren716> Bolt is great for a ton of enemies this time
[1:28:41] <MKII> weak point damage is king
[1:28:41] <SainEdge> precision is sooo good against weakpoints
[1:28:41] <%doomerskeletor13> Either one will be useful
[1:28:43] <+GeneralHysterics> this a brobot
[1:28:43] <+inktoxicant> NO PUNCH VEGA
[1:28:43] <+mechslayer71> YOU CANT AIM WOOLIE
[1:28:43] <+prime_name> @mechslayer71 the hitbox is fairly generous tho
[1:28:45] <%Solidnick18> ehh
[1:28:45] <AntifaCatboy> Micro missiles get replaced by the chaingun later.

[1:28:51] <+DesertPenguin> Shotgun is easy mode for weak points. Precision Scope is hard mode

[1:28:51] <%GeneralSCPatton> The good boi
[1:28:52] <%Mrthefro> But controller tho

[1:28:53] <%doomerskeletor13> It‚Äôs our boi
[1:28:58] <$TIME_PUNCHER> the problem with precision bolt is that it requires precision
[1:29:03] <%QaizerArt> vega is a good boy

[1:32:34] <%horse_oil> the fact that basic melee does almost nothing is a bit weird in this game

[1:37:21] <pixel_river> alot of people didnt like the classic catooniness at launch
[1:37:28] <%Javaa01> @WoolieVersus The mouth on the Cacodemons don't have to be open for the weakpoint to work, just DO NOT use the grenades, they have way too much drop to be of any use beyond melee range, and melee range with Cacos is death

[1:47:40] <pixel_river> this part next killed some times
[1:47:42] <%tearfuldevil> @Bodregg not really at all, tbh
[1:47:46] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> The Hell has come back to Earth... nature is healing....
[1:47:47] <petwisk> @stacemcgate absolutely well balanced but i still think newcomers Will have a Better time learning the game on Hurt me Plenty before jumping on UV
[1:47:50] <%doomerskeletor13> Mario traps
[1:47:52] <Bodregg> has woolie realized that doom eternal is just first-person-shooter DMC yet?
[1:47:53] <+xTheAngryDwarfx> He‚Äôs starting to believe
[1:48:02] <+TheBigTaco> the map tells you if there are secrets
[1:48:02] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:48:12] <+mechslayer71> @bodregg that‚Äôs how pat described it to him on the podcast
[1:48:20] <raveous> it's too earlier for him to really consider it as fps DMC yet
[1:48:22] <Prevot> what's an hdoom enemy doing here
[1:48:24] <%FuqBoiSlim> @bodregg when he gets the super shottie he'll have no choice
[1:48:28] <BusterRepukken> please use the precision bolt
[1:48:28] <+Mkingston> I died so many times here. Kept running out of ammo.

[1:48:38] <Nomad94> Hurt me Plenty is just what it says: You're gonna get hurt pretty bad, but you're not gonna get the full "Fuck my Life" experience. That's fine to me
[1:48:41] <heart_ablaze> Dante v.s. Doom Slayer, what if?
[1:48:47] <+TheBigTaco> aim higher woolie lol
[1:48:51] <Mister_McDerp> NA aim
[1:48:52] <raveous> hooray for no more instadeath falls
[1:48:54] <+thesyndrome> remind me again: who in chat was saying woolie should play on UV?
[1:48:55] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @heart_ablaze that's tough man
[1:48:56] <SainEdge> the abyss beccons
[1:49:02] <pixel_river> nice

[1:49:08] <Shishi1205> Look at woolie gasp irl
[1:49:11] <%doomerskeletor13> Woolie picked the perfect difficulty to start on
[1:49:13] <$arcielardor> AIM WOOLIE, AIM!
[1:49:13] <%StaceMcGate> @petwisk Newcomers to DOOM or FPS? If new to FPS, absolutely play normal or easy. Not trying to sound elitist, I just found more satisfaction on UV in overcoming tough challenges
[1:49:17] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @heart_ablaze they're both pretty much immortal
[1:49:19] <petwisk> BTW waste no time before upgrating the sticky bombs they're a life saviors, make sure to upgrade the sticky bombs First
[1:49:19] <Mister_McDerp> woolie on UV would be awful to watch
[1:49:25] <Bodregg> @thesyndrome that was before we remembered the atrocity that is woolie-aim combined with console-aim

[1:49:47] <+frankthetank285> woolie use the damn granade launcher to destroy the turret on the spider
[1:49:49] <%Javaa01> @WoolieVersus Jerry can sloshing noise means you got a stock of gas
[1:49:50] <ralphfromdk> That was the noise of chainsaw being ready again
[1:49:51] <%xpakeo> im excited for the slayer gates lol, my first slayer gate took like an hour on my first playthrough
[1:49:51] <BusterRepukken> You really gotta use the precision bolt
[1:49:55] <+xTheAngryDwarfx> @heart_ablaze A unstoppable force meeting a immovable object
[1:49:55] <Jack8274> I legit didn't know what the noise was for ages
[1:49:58] <BillsOnFire> what is that thing in his hands
[1:49:59] <AppleBoi85> the 1up behind
[1:49:59] <user_naim> You‚Äôre doing fine
[1:50:02] <Nomad94> @StaceMcGate I typically get frustrated before anything else if it feels too tough, so I'd rather get on with the game than struggle for an hour and quit.
[1:50:02] <%Th3SmartAlec> "WHO?"
[1:50:04] <Reveresao> brake out the cube
[1:50:07] <zocano> Woolie will figure it out

[1:51:47] <Bodregg> oh, we're FAR past the corporate energy, this is full on cult energy
[1:51:52] <+GeneralHysterics> so dante vs doomguy is actually a really interesting fight. Dante has been shown to eat single bullets for lunch but doomguy never serves up a single bullet. Double dashes with suit upgrades are probably only a little worse than trickster dashes, tho dante's got his teleportation bs.

[2:08:52] <+inktoxicant> with a demon registry
[2:08:53] <Bodregg> @WoolieVersus whatever you do, check the demon lore when you get it because it contains enemy weaknesses
[2:08:53] <Monkeyweed21> just read the lore as you go its a lot easier to digest
[2:08:59] <%ChoculaUltra> Reggie is a solid co-pilot
[2:09:05] <+The_Kindled_Spirit> how long before the anime episodes start to drop?
[2:09:05] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1260094696292048899
[2:09:07] <ghostspartan80> lore is a good read as you play
[2:09:09] <AppleBoi85> A reading rainbow of gore
[2:09:12] <Shishi1205> The lore level is the sickest
[2:09:13] <%gunsrlove> based General Patton
[2:09:14] <dekkitout> It's a non optional pain point
[2:09:18] <+MalfestedAlastor> They ruined the simple lore of Doom 2016
[2:09:21] <Shishi1205> Big based
[2:09:25] <Bodregg> i dunno i really didn't appreciate the lore level
[2:09:27] <@Menitta> I fucking hate having to make a new password for something that i need to remember
[2:09:27] <worldbrand> you also dont get shit out of it and they get to annoy you with their newsletter
[2:09:28] <BusterRepukken> It';s the same lore, lmao.
[2:09:30] <Gamingc00l> when is the new vegas playthrough?
[2:09:30] <+prime_name> It's a speedbump to the highway of video game
[2:09:31] <Shishi1205> They ruined nothing
[2:09:37] <Shishi1205> Don't hate
[2:09:38] <+Mkingston> Woolie doesn't want to set up an account on stream too.
[2:09:39] <BusterRepukken> The lore is fine, it's the same lore, lmao.
[2:09:51] <%derap41> They know you will take it
[2:09:59] <Quicksilver295> Check the map the very second you get the fast travel prompt, the next scene WILL end the mission
[2:10:02] <knowyourenemy_97> what happen?
[2:10:06] <Nano_osecond> log online to play our single player game-
[2:10:08] <+sunsetserenity1> I agree that it shouldn't be there, but it just not a big deal
[2:10:11] <%gatorafan> And then you can tell investors how much people love the service you forced them to use
[2:10:17] <%derap41> you've rented the game woolie
[2:10:20] <%Captain_Aham> people innately don't like being told what to do
[2:10:29] <pixel_river> put in a papmplet in the box or something
[2:10:31] <%derap41> Woolie you do not own that game you have rented it
[2:10:41] <+PodreySanchezz> Has Woolie seen the Naughty Dog leaks?
[2:10:43] <%Drchandragupta> @Nano_osecond there's mp content though
[2:10:44] <+VidulaSaix> I mean like it or not Woolie, that shit's here to stay. You just need to get used to it and just do it instead of complaining about it
[2:10:45] <DSD24> You can die instead
[2:10:48] <+VidulaSaix> It's annoying yes
[2:10:48] <LoganPayne> but Woolie, don't you want to fill up an arbitrary xp bar. link your twitch account to get the doomicorn (so we can get your email)
[2:10:49] <knowyourenemy_97> im confuse
[2:10:52] <PlainSimpleTailor> I already gave you 60 bucks Todd Howard, you lispy little cockroach
[2:10:56] <+MalfestedAlastor> Nah, nothing about the new world energy crisis or being imbued with super powers in 2016
[2:10:58] <Shishi1205> YEs
[2:10:58] <Monkeyweed21> GIVE EDGE A CHANCE
[2:10:59] <%Javaa01> Microsoft does it because of DRM
[2:11:01] <%tearfuldevil> woolie, we don't actually own games, unless we have a physical copy that requires no downloads and is compeltely offline
[2:11:02] <Shishi1205> The samll promps
[2:11:06] <hat_under_bread> Oh god, it even caches the network credentials to force you to make a Microsoft account NotLikeThis
[2:11:08] <%ChoculaUltra> "It just works."
[2:11:10] <Shishi1205> Get avast free
[2:11:10] <+Mkingston> Preach!
[2:11:11] <Nano_osecond> Get your drops- get your twitch smell emotes
[2:11:15] <LoganPayne> Chrome Edge is good.
[2:11:16] <Monkeyweed21> GIVE MICROSOFT EDGE A CHANCE @WoolieVersus
[2:11:17] <Shishi1205> why, I didn't download avast
[2:11:20] <BusterRepukken> @MalfestedAlastor those things are literally in 2016 lmao

[2:11:58] <AntifaCatboy> @WoolieVersus if you link a Twitch Prime account with a Bethesda account you can unlock a unicorn skin in the game.

[2:12:24] <+inktoxicant> Woolie the Red Bar Rehabilitator
[2:12:24] <zachztb> just use windows millennium edition
[2:12:29] <%Visorak6> Being the mediator doesnt always work sadly, some people be how they be
[2:12:31] <dekkitout> Or have them match with those of an equal connection quality
[2:12:33] <%CommanderSqueaks> No, throw rotten fruit at the Wi-Fi players
[2:12:34] <cipher758> The Wifi Wars
[2:12:36] <%CommanderSqueaks> Shame them
[2:12:36] <%Exiliator> Make a series called Get OUT of fighting games were you just call out people like wi-fi users LUL
[2:12:37] <+CryptusMaximus> Mortal Kombat did it and no one batted an eye
[2:12:38] <user_naim> MOOD
[2:12:40] <%gatorafan> Don't argue, consume service
[2:12:41] <worldbrand> for perspective, none of the souls games make you make accounts and the online is arguably half the appeal to a lot of people

[2:14:21] <+ALazo> I don't get the people that get stuck on the wifi thing and refuse to consider wired like it something bizarre and alien. A long time ago I used to play on wifi thinking there was no difference, had a shitty experience, eventually realized I could make it better just by plugging in an ethernet cable, and that was that.

[2:14:58] <GarbageNirvana> He reaches his hand out for a handshake and it turns into a punch automatically
[2:14:58] <%GeneralSCPatton> Click the green screen after every level for a transmission from Earth
[2:15:02] <+ALazo> @CommanderSqueaks Pat is special, though
[2:15:04] <@Menitta> Listen, when people on their $1200 PC setups playing Mortal Kombat 11 can't afford a wired cable, we gotta be inclusive Kappa
[2:15:12] <%CommanderSqueaks> @garbagenirvana Isn't that just a fist bump tho?
[2:15:17] <Bodregg> @WoolieVersus this is an extremely important tool, it's where you get almost all of your armor. use it whenever it's off cooldown
[2:15:19] <%DensityD> woolieYE
[2:15:20] <+YabbaTroll> Flame belch + grenade = profit
[2:15:21] <SainEdge> i love the flame belch. took me some time to get used to it tho
[2:15:23] <%kapcommunist> this is super useful
[2:15:24] <MasterTonberry23> Remember, ABC, Always Be Cflame belching
[2:15:31] <Louie_Salmon> If they die
[2:15:34] <+VidulaSaix> DROPS FOR DAYS
[2:15:35] <GarbageNirvana> @CommanderSqueaks It's hard to tell the difference with him because both will destroy your bones
[2:15:39] <Aplecraf> so much backseat here :O
[2:15:39] <Agami23> so burn then chainsaw for tons of armor and ammo
[2:15:40] <%DensityD> Fire Enemies will never stagger?
[2:15:40] <Shishi1205> yep
[2:15:41] <Josef_Stryker> Flame Belch + Chainsaw fro big combo
[2:15:42] <%Visorak6> AND GRENADES

[2:15:56] <%gunsrlove> sssslow
[2:15:57] <%Solidnick18> slow for now
[2:15:59] <Shishi1205> Use it on cd
[2:16:01] <%doomerskeletor13> It‚Äôs a juggling act
[2:16:02] <@Menitta> Its a loop in what to use
[2:16:07] <+GeneralHysterics> you can get it back faster with upgrades and runes
[2:16:08] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:16:10] <SunsetJack> You charge it faster with kills no?
[2:16:11] <ReiDuran> Health/Armor/Ammo balancing act is cool
[2:16:14] <ralphfromdk> And now you start to see why it has become more like a DmC instead of just shoot bang boom
[2:16:15] <%Javaa01> @WoolieVersus Cooldown on the flamethrower is long at first, once upgraded, it matches the chainsaw recharge speed
[2:16:20] <+YabbaTroll> @DensityD they do but i dont think you get the extra armor from glory kills
[2:16:21] <%DensityD> learn an MMO rotation LUL
[2:16:24] <@Menitta> The flow of this game is fun but I also found it rather strict
[2:16:25] <ppi1993> you can get upgrades to the cooldown
[2:16:32] <Louie_Salmon> This is exactly a rotation
[2:16:41] <dekkitout> Build those apm reflexes
[2:16:46] <Bodregg> all of these are good, go for whatever you want first
[2:16:47] <+johnny_gogo> @WoolieVersus you can make the hud bigger it was too small for me personally at first
[2:16:47] <AppleBoi85> You'l upgrade that soon

[2:17:07] <%DensityD> but what if ammo though
[2:17:10] <Shishi1205> Upgrade 2 and you get an ability
[2:17:11] <CureMode666> ammo
[2:17:13] <Bodregg> shiny crystals are all the rage now, sauron eyes are so four years ago
[2:17:14] <Louie_Salmon> It's 2020 and Woolie is playing a first person shooter with MMO cooldowns
[2:17:15] <CureMode666> get the ammo
[2:17:16] <Reveresao> ammo
[2:17:18] <%Javaa01> Get both sides to unlock perk
[2:17:20] <ralphfromdk> FuqBoiSlim Eh, you already have endless ammo with the chainsaw :p
[2:17:20] <resloxxx> you get a bonus if you upgrade both sides
[2:17:27] <Agami23> get both to get the middle
[2:17:28] <Darren716> Once you get both you unlock the main upgrade
[2:17:29] <DedlokPM> you get both to get the middle upgrade
[2:17:33] <%WanderingSwordsman> get both to unlock the bonus
[2:17:36] <%CommanderSqueaks> Do you guys like upgrade menues? Get ready for Infinite Upgrade Menu works.
[2:17:45] <ralphfromdk> You only get the upgrade when you go both of the unlocks for it.
[2:17:46] <Shishi1205> You need both upgrades
[2:17:49] <+arancet> get both sides to get ability
[2:17:49] <asurite_warrior> so you into Satan now woolie?
[2:17:51] <%kapcommunist> you get blood punch next level

[2:17:58] <ralphfromdk> Yes
[2:17:58] <Darren716> Yes
[2:17:59] <megamonmon123> you need both to unlock

[2:18:04] <%Lightwolfe> yes
[2:18:04] <Bodregg> i think i've seen something similar to this, but i can't remember what game it was

[2:18:13] <LeviathanNexus> ep
[2:18:14] <%DensityD> POG
[2:18:17] <%FuqBoiSlim> perhaps...
[2:18:38] <DSD24> Max out ammo is really helpful
[2:18:38] <randominternetsurfer> it doesn't stagger
[2:18:38] <Louie_Salmon> It's essentially just for armor
[2:18:40] <Bodregg> fire does no damage, it's there purely for armor gain
[2:18:40] <CureMode666> it dose more damage when they are on fire
[2:18:42] <%Javaa01> Fire does singular points of damage, and it DOES NOT stagger
[2:18:43] <Monkeyweed21> its not for damage
[2:18:44] <dekkitout> @Bodregg Mobas have ability progression paths kinda like this
[2:18:45] <+johnny_gogo> it feels like it helps with glory kills a little

[2:36:39] <$Essixian> Quite the opposite, it's ReALLY EASY to pull the trigger so you shoot yourself in the foor by accident
[2:36:43] <%GeneralSCPatton> CHECK ALL THE SCREENS. ESPECIALLY THE GREEN ONE.
[2:36:45] <chaumiester> No, that means the gun is super easy to fire. That's why there are so many self inflicted gun shots
[2:36:49] <alexandrecau> German weren't terrified they just found it poor taste to be show with a gun used to kill fowls
[2:36:51] <Shishi1205> Neat

[2:52:30] <cipher758> I love it how it's just a glowing fist lol
[2:52:36] <%doomerskeletor13> The blood punch mechanic is why regular melee was downgraded
[2:52:36] <Nomad94> so it's a one-time punch that doesn't deal pitiful damage
[2:52:37] <RunningNGunning> BLOOD PAWNCH
[2:52:38] <+DesertPenguin> two glory kills = 1 blood punch
[2:52:42] <mark_collins45> Fist them

[2:53:03] <%Fattness132> 2 glory kills = 1 blood punch
[2:53:08] <%gunsrlove> DEMON CHOIR PUNCHES

[2:53:14] <$Essixian> Blood Punch! Gore Kick! Bone Suplex! tomatoYell
[2:53:15] <%Lightwolfe> 2 Glory kills = BP
[2:53:18] <@Menitta> man the foley work of this game is so good
[2:53:25] <%gatorafan> Doomguy kicked that tree
[2:53:26] <Bodregg> @WoolieVersus remember to flamethrower for your armor
[2:53:36] <praisedasun_> I think he forgot the belch
[2:53:39] <%Fattness132> 2 glory kills
[2:53:45] <Tucker0603> remember flame belch to get armor
[2:53:45] <Bodregg> 2 kills per punch
[2:53:47] <%doomerskeletor13> I love the multicolored ammo. Makes them seem like pi√±atas
[2:53:48] <CureMode666> it takes 2
[2:53:51] <Reveresao> Slow Mo! Slow Mo! Slow Mo! Slow Mo!
[2:53:51] <@Menitta> like punching a demon sounds like a hammer to a box of potato chips
[2:53:52] <$Essixian> @Menitta Many bundles of celery were crunched during the making of this game
[2:53:52] <Shishi1205> RUNES
[2:53:53] <RunningNGunning> You'll KNOW if you use it
[2:53:54] <%Solidnick18> RUNES

[2:53:57] <%GeneralSCPatton> SLOW TIME
[2:53:58] <@Menitta> celery ye
[2:53:58] <+ZeroMP_> 2 glory = 1 gorey
[2:54:02] <%Javaa01> @WoolieVersus Two glory kills to charge a stock, chainsaw kills do NOT count towards charges
[2:54:02] <Jack8274> SLOW DOWN
[2:54:04] <%doomerskeletor13> I saved blood punch‚Äôs for the big boys
[2:54:04] <CureMode666> get the slo mo rune
[2:54:06] <brunoberserk> slowmo
[2:54:06] <Darren716> Slow time with the bolt is busted
[2:54:06] <mark_collins45> Runes help you ruin things.
[2:54:07] <%Solidnick18> take that angel pwer
[2:54:07] <+VidulaSaix> @WoolieVersus HIGHLY recommend the Mobility one
[2:54:08] <Reveresao> Slow Mo! Slow Mo! Slow Mo! Slow Mo
[2:54:08] <Bodregg> GUN TO YOUR HEAD: Favorite Rune
[2:54:11] <%GeneralSCPatton> BIG SLO MO

[2:54:16] <Jack8274> SLOW MO FO SHO
[2:54:16] <Shishi1205> No
[2:54:17] <%Irridium> INCREASED GLORY KILL DISTANCE
[2:54:17] <Louie_Salmon> Trials were cool, but I'm glad they simplified this
[2:54:19] <+Stupid121v2> PICK
[2:54:19] <%doomerskeletor13> Slow Mo will be Woolies best friend
[2:54:22] <%gunsrlove> BLOOD PUNCH HP THO
[2:54:23] <randominternetsurfer> GET AIR TRAVERSAL
[2:54:24] <BusterRepukken> blood fueled
[2:54:24] <+Stupid121v2> YOU GET 9
[2:54:25] <+greenfall> id go for jump movement
[2:54:27] <resloxxx> GOTTA GO FAST
[2:54:32] <ShmowzowKapow> slow mo is for the weak
[2:54:35] <@Menitta> thats a good one
[2:54:37] <%Irridium> ^
[2:54:38] <+Stupid121v2> Speed boost is NICE
[2:54:39] <Nomad94> Slow mo would be good if it didn't also trigger half of every weapon mod Kappa
[2:54:39] <SheefEatsBeef> god blood fueled is so fun
[2:54:43] <$Essixian> Let him do what he wants chat, geez tomatoMMM
[2:54:46] <Bodregg> my favorite is air mobility, but it's entirely up to you
[2:54:46] <+VidulaSaix> Air Control is SO good
[2:54:53] <%Visorak6> Air control is 100%
[2:54:53] <Shishi1205> LUL
[2:54:53] <MKII> air movement behaves like ground movement
[2:54:54] <resloxxx> a must for doomguy
[2:54:55] <%Gruhunchously> I'd go with Air Control
[2:54:55] <+tuchpi> POYO LUL
[2:54:58] <+RyTYoung> it's a good
[2:54:58] <randominternetsurfer> AIR CONTROL IS REALLY GOOD
[2:54:59] <+Stupid121v2> Air Movement is also NICE
[2:54:59] <%Javaa01> @WoolieVersus The game already has a built in magic pixel system, Saving Throw is a free extra life one per life
[2:55:04] <%Gruhunchously> Mobility is key
[2:55:04] <%doomerskeletor13> Very good
[2:55:04] <Nomad94> never used air control
[2:55:05] <zocano> chronostrike is mandatory
[2:55:06] <Jack8274> Almost Manditory

[3:02:06] <RunningNGunning> Now you get upgrades
[3:02:06] <+OfficerMods> blood punch ignores armor
[3:02:06] <MayorRev> Epic Mickey
[3:02:08] <knowyourenemy_97> It's always the impz you gotta kill last.....
[3:02:11] <andrei11dr> Ah ok
[3:02:12] <Jack8274> YOUR SUPPOSED TOOOOO
[3:02:18] <%Solidnick18> Please read this
[3:02:22] <Jack8274> Why are you ever using normal shotgun?
[3:02:25] <Shishi1205> Sticky is good regardless
[3:02:28] <%Fattness132> Sticky bomb just uses 1 ammo - USE IT ALL YOU CAN
[3:02:31] <+johnny_gogo> @WoolieVersus dont forget you have 3 stickys
[3:02:31] <+That_Marcus_Dude> The sticky bomb should be your primary fire
[3:02:34] <Bodregg> he only has normal shotgun and rifle jack
[3:02:34] <+D00msDayDan> @Jack8274 he literally started playing today
[3:02:35] <Nihilisticdestroyer> stickys are always worth it tho cuz its 1 ammo
[3:03:05] <Jack8274> @D00msDayDan I know lol, but even in Doom 2016 woolie loved his shotty which I never have
[3:03:06] <mark_collins45> Unlock the micro missiles next chance, they're real handy.
[3:03:07] <Reveresao> I can't wait for the gate LUL LUL
[3:03:07] <DeathByPoke7> wheres the style meter tho
[3:03:07] <knowyourenemy_97> Normal shotgun is the best gun rn
[3:03:18] <megamonmon123> @deathbypoke7 its your health
[3:03:40] <Jack8274> The Sticky launcher fires at the normal shotgun speed, but I didn't realize that until WAY too late
[3:03:44] <MayorRev> Does woolie have the throwback shotgun skin?
[3:03:44] <Bodregg> woolie be like PJSalt
[3:03:47] <%Javaa01> @WoolieVersus Red boxes are regular, intended encounters, Purple boxes are Challenge rooms, Pink boxes are Secret missions and Gold boxes are bosses
[3:04:05] <+OfficerMods> weapon cancel is a mechanic in this game btw
[3:04:31] <+That_Marcus_Dude> That mastery is super good
[3:04:43] <Yummy_Nukes> @woolieversus did you know you can change the ui color? there's a purple theme you'd probably like
[3:04:48] <Forgottenblade_> micro missle
[3:04:49] <Bodregg> he knows
[3:04:53] <%gunsrlove> he went through the ui colours
[3:04:54] <%tearfuldevil> @Yummy_Nukes he does
[3:04:56] <%paladinstarbuster> He knows
[3:05:01] <CookieCutter007> animation canceling on controller is prob really hard
[3:05:03] <%gunsrlove> knows he
[3:05:21] <+DesertPenguin> In my opinion it's not worth it
[3:05:22] <Shishi1205> 15
[3:05:23] <%Javaa01> 15
[3:05:29] <UvBenServed> Is there a UI option to change text size?
[3:05:31] <+DesertPenguin> The full auto
[3:05:42] <Agami23> 20/20
[3:05:42] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1260094696292048899
[3:05:43] <mark_collins45> I wish you could change the font too.
[3:05:43] <+prime_name> Whys the font gotta be so small in this game?
[3:05:46] <+DesertPenguin> You can change the HUD size that's it
[3:05:46] <MKII> a little ambitious
[3:05:48] <Jack8274> Woolie getting a headshot LUL
[3:05:50] <%Javaa01> Headshots turn enemies into explosive barrels
[3:05:51] <Bodregg> Pop! :)
[3:05:53] <Yummy_Nukes> k, didn't catch the beginning of the stream
[3:05:53] <+tuchpi> YOU HAVE TO HIT A HEADSHOT THOUGH Kappa
[3:05:55] <%Solidnick18> it's pretty goooood
[3:05:56] <dekkitout> Firefly from Destiny?
[3:05:57] <+OfficerMods> higher skill cap on scope for obvious reasons
[3:05:58] <%Irridium> you can make subtitles bigger but not any other text
[3:06:00] <%Ecchigun> @woolieversus dont touch precision bolt, thats mine
[3:06:00] <Shishi1205> Kappa
[3:06:01] <VJdarkworld> magic missile
[3:06:07] <NirreMusic> big boom tho
[3:06:07] <knowyourenemy_97> yes
[3:06:13] <mark_collins45> Micro Missile Chan
[3:06:14] <mdkcde> Easier with slowmo tho
[3:06:15] <knowyourenemy_97> if you want too......
[3:06:17] <+toomuchsnarfsnarf> YOOOO just got here lets go
[3:06:25] <+tuchpi> PogChamp
[3:06:25] <bleugh> just click on heads KAppa
[3:06:26] <rsg220> slow mo is basically how you land the headshots in hectic fights
[3:06:28] <+Stupid121v2> @WoolieVersus you can change the UI color if it helps ya eyes any, but not font :/
[3:06:31] <Bodregg> micro-missiles are one of the fastest damage options in the game
[3:06:55] <mdkcde> better save for mastery woolie
[3:07:01] <mdkcde> instead of spreading them out
[3:07:08] <randominternetsurfer> @bodregg not in this game though. they've been nerfed.
[3:07:09] <memes_are_cancer> Can't wait for woolie to fight the equivalent of Vergil in this game
[3:07:10] <ralphfromdk> Once unlocked, you can go farm those challenges as you clean up hidden items.
[3:07:18] <DamnJP> also the game doesn't have the pistol, and a lot of people don't even realize it LUL
[3:07:23] <Picosunloaded> did he get the one up
[3:07:27] <BusterRepukken> you come back here
[3:07:30] <%Visorak6> you come back
[3:07:31] <Darren716> the red is later
[3:07:31] <%Javaa01> That red is for a later encounter
[3:07:33] <Bodregg> still higher than anything that isn't weapon-switching or mobile turret though
[3:07:35] <user_naim> That‚Äôs later
[3:07:35] <AppleBoi85> later on
[3:07:36] <%WanderingSwordsman> don't worry about it, you'll come back
[3:07:39] <+OfficerMods> @bodregg only on its own, the meta is based around weapon swaps
[3:07:53] <cipher758> Demon Vergil. I forgot about him
[3:07:56] <Bodregg> @OfficerMods hence why i said one of and not the
[3:07:57] <stormhawk9891> I love the constant fart noises from those jump pads
[3:07:57] <ralphfromdk> It only recharges after it has been fully spent
[3:08:00] <%GeneralSCPatton> I think it only refills after it's empty.
[3:08:03] <Iwashi94> it doesn't seem to fill back unless you use it all up
[3:08:04] <rsg220> it doesnt recharge until you drain it completely
[3:08:21] <%Javaa01> A big ass locked door
[3:08:29] <memes_are_cancer> Think you'll come back later

[3:33:08] <%GeneralSCPatton> CACO BITE IS SUPER DEADLY
[3:33:08] <MasterTonberry23> ADAPT AND SURVIVE
[3:33:11] <%tearfuldevil> straight lines are death woolie
[3:33:11] <Mister_McDerp> imagine him playing this in UV
[3:33:12] <mdkcde> The CaC is Wak
[3:33:13] <+toomuchsnarfsnarf> MORTIS
[3:33:16] <dekkitout> Caco studied his matchups
[3:33:17] <%WanderingSwordsman> 0-3

[3:33:19] <knowyourenemy_97> is this hard mode?@WoolieMadden
[3:33:20] <haitakaa> does woolie have a PS4 Pro?
[3:33:21] <Viewtiful_Rose> You‚Äôre staying too still.
[3:33:22] <Nested_Dreams> Grenades are better for. mass staggers
[3:33:23] <EnlightenedKramer> church boys?
[3:33:23] <andrei11dr> You can beat this with a controller, it's just Woolie doesn't really play FPS games so his aim is like being drunk in space
[3:33:24] <zocano> All enemy melee hurts a ton
[3:33:24] <joniroquai> the caco bite is actually it's highest damage attack
[3:33:24] <vVAstrAVv> if you dont blow up the caca at least dont forget to SHOOT IT
[3:33:25] <%Lightwolfe> imagine getting bopped by a caco
[3:33:25] <cipher758> evolve or DIE
[3:33:25] <VJdarkworld> can a mousie be plugged into the ps4?
[3:33:29] <Goraka91> It's much more like the older Dooms where you stop you die
[3:33:31] <ralphfromdk> Full auto if you wanna shred the knights real fast
[3:33:31] <zocano> They want you to keep moving around
[3:33:31] <JaseAdrift> GET GOOD
[3:33:32] <sleepy_pixels> @Javaa01 ah shame. let the suffering continue
[3:33:35] <%tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus you're a zoner, stay mobile, don't get put against a wall
[3:33:36] <Shishi1205> Blood punch him
[3:33:37] <+third_impact_762> stick and move
[3:33:39] <knowyourenemy_97> This has to be hard mode....
[3:33:45] <Shishi1205> Remember you have it
[3:33:45] <ghostspartan80> stay far from those cacs
[3:33:48] <+third_impact_762> noipe its normal hes just bad
[3:33:50] <%Javaa01> @VJdarkworld Yes, but only certain games support it, this is not one of those games
[3:33:54] <%Fattness132> Hell Knight is rushing you down while caco is a zoner - keep moving and dodging. never stop the movement
[3:33:54] <%gunsrlove> Don't in the corner NotLikeThis
[3:33:54] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1260094696292048899
[3:33:56] <Viewtiful_Rose> Woolie will NOT play mouse and keyboard for shooting games for people who don‚Äôt know
[3:33:58] <knowyourenemy_97> wow....
[3:34:04] <haitakaa> dat aim
[3:34:05] <%GeneralSCPatton> PICK A CIRCUIT AND KEEP GOING
[3:34:08] <+SnapIntoaTimJim> @hugh_ns But why?
[3:34:13] <resloxxx> dont do what darlington doesnt
[3:34:16] <+third_impact_762> cause hes stupid and ignorant
[3:34:22] <jeosadn> Saying without malice, but this level of gameplay has upgraded from "arthritic" to straight up rigor mortis LUL
[3:34:22] <ralphfromdk> Full auto shotgun for anything that wants to hug you. Kills them nice and quick
[3:34:24] <Viewtiful_Rose> @snapintoatimjim he just doesn‚Äôt like it
[3:34:26] <ghostspartan80> let him learn guys
[3:34:31] <+SnapIntoaTimJim> Ah, Fair.
[3:34:32] <%Foopoof> psaCaco psaCaco psaCaco psaCaco
[3:34:34] <buttbag> The key word is ADAPT
[3:34:34] <Goraka91> How about another LUL
[3:34:36] <Shishi1205> Use fire, no armor
[3:34:38] <%Lightwolfe> he gon learn today
[3:34:40] <Tuna_Can_0> WASD controls are most likely uncomfortable
[3:34:42] <alexandrecau> blood punch
[3:34:43] <%Gruhunchously> Big bois
[3:34:44] <Viewtiful_Rose> There was a very long podcast bit about his disliking of it
[3:34:46] <%StaceMcGate> D-D-Dismal
[3:34:51] <knowyourenemy_97> this game is a far cry from Doom2016
[3:34:54] <user_naim> BLOOD PUNCH
[3:34:58] <Shishi1205> Blood punch when you have it
[3:35:02] <%tearfuldevil> there are people who play with contorllers whoa re eprfectyl good at shooters
[3:35:05] <ghostspartan80> three fuel for any other demon
[3:35:05] <+third_impact_762> just because you dislike somthing, doesnt mean it isnt the right thing to do
[3:35:06] <%Mejari> gotta use that dash constantly to get around
[3:35:07] <%tearfuldevil> woolie's jsut bad
[3:35:07] <%Javaa01> It's Doom 2016 but without the rampant cheese
[3:35:09] <Kidbizzaro> Living on the Razor's Edge
[3:35:10] <snakest3alth> Blood Punch
[3:35:11] <%Gruhunchously> SEEK MEDICAL ATTENTION
[3:35:12] <vVAstrAVv> does he have the flame thrower at this point? i dont think so.
[3:35:13] <%Javaa01> So you have to play legit
[3:35:18] <+SnapIntoaTimJim> Panic
[3:35:22] <grimshuck> stop dashing into the enemy
[3:35:23] <DynamicMenace_> bro
[3:35:24] <Darren716> Flame gulch is good for a pinch
[3:35:25] <%Fattness132> stop standing still
[3:35:27] <%Fattness132> always move
[3:35:28] <knowyourenemy_97> bodied
[3:35:28] <user_naim> BLOOD PUNCH
[3:35:29] <%GeneralSCPatton> Stop trying to juke past the enemies. Pick a circuit and keep running away in a loop.
[3:35:29] <Monkeyweed21> blood punch
[3:35:31] <+BattsuTheCrow> way better than Doom 2016 tbh
[3:35:32] <%Reverend_Roscoe> move, you fool
[3:35:33] <andrei11dr> That's 4
[3:35:33] <%tearfuldevil> @third_impact_762 this is a video game
[3:35:34] <+BattsuTheCrow> both great though
[3:35:35] <cipher758> ded
[3:35:36] <ralphfromdk> Full. Auto. Shotgun
[3:35:36] <%paladinstarbuster> shot gun and sticky can save you from missing shots
[3:35:37] <CoffeeSlice> loop!
[3:35:40] <%Lightwolfe> Use flame on fodder
[3:35:42] <user_naim> IF CORNERED Blood Punch
[3:35:42] <randominternetsurfer> stop trying to juke
[3:35:43] <+toomuchsnarfsnarf> let him learn yo
[3:35:44] <memes_are_cancer> Next arenas are gonna be rough
[3:35:45] <mdkcde> FUll auto shotgun is good on him
[3:35:45] <ghostspartan80> don't forget about those monkey bars
[3:35:46] <Reveresao> full auto
[3:35:46] <%OldManDeckardCain> crunch? what a naughty dog... demon
[3:35:47] <stormhawk9891> Sorry to say but his aim is atrocious
[3:35:47] <turbofolk> Get baptized in fire
[3:35:48] <%Gruhunchously> Everything?
[3:35:51] <haitakaa> do combo
[3:35:51] <Shishi1205> Blood punch buys you time
[3:35:52] <VJdarkworld> aiming and positioning
[3:35:56] <%gunsrlove> @WoolieVersus Enemies are sticky and ruin your mobility and dashes are NOT i-frames
[3:36:03] <MasterTonberry23> I remember when I first payed DMC1, I was getting my ass beat on the first Phantom fight. Took me a while to adapt
[3:36:04] <knowyourenemy_97> Don't forget to flame to get armor
[3:36:10] <+CryptusMaximus> We at 4? Good good. Training for the Marauder
[3:36:13] <+third_impact_762> i never said it wasnt
[3:36:15] <+frankthetank285> woolie shoot the enemies
[3:36:17] <%Javaa01> You're used to cheesing them
[3:36:19] <%tearfuldevil> @stormhawk9891 as long as you aren't being needlessly abrasive no reason to apologize, even woolie will admit his aim's bad
[3:36:19] <andrei11dr> He did have trouble with the big guys in 2016 as well
[3:36:20] <%Javaa01> Not fighting them
[3:36:22] <LoganPayne> Can you plug a mouse into a ps4 for this game?
[3:36:24] <Nested_Dreams> Flame your glory kill targets for more healz
[3:36:33] <ghostspartan80> grenade staggers him
[3:36:37] <turbofolk> Run like a coward
[3:36:38] <+third_impact_762> my point still remains
[3:36:42] <+BattsuTheCrow> this game is just more demanding of the player than Doom 2016
[3:36:42] <ralphfromdk> Woolie is being very un-doomguy-like :D
[3:36:47] <%OldManDeckardCain> we clearly need the mighty gamer cube to save woolie Kappa
[3:36:47] <memes_are_cancer> Slayer gates are gonna be hellish
[3:36:53] <%kapcommunist> have blood punch still too
[3:36:57] <+BattsuTheCrow> So people that can't keep up automatically call it trash
[3:37:00] <+frankthetank285> @loganpayne no PS4 has no mouse keyboard support
[3:37:00] <%Lightwolfe> blood punch
[3:37:19] <%FuqBoiSlim> is woolie ever gonna get the unmakyr
[3:37:19] <MasterTonberry23> Dont forget slomo and flame belch
[3:37:21] <Shishi1205> Drop your blood punch woolie
[3:37:26] <Monkeyweed21> BLOOD PUNCH
[3:37:31] <knowyourenemy_97> CaCa demons do a lot of damage with their mouth
[3:37:39] <Shishi1205> L2 for slow mo
[3:37:39] <%GeneralSCPatton> Got that slo mo
[3:37:40] <ISkyHunterI> the unmakyr was the only dissapointing thing in the game
[3:37:41] <+third_impact_762> hes gonna have to drop difficulty
[3:37:44] <BoneBagMel> Change the dash button to a bumper, so you don't have to stop aiming
[3:37:45] <Viewtiful_Rose> Blood punch woolie. You‚Äôre forgetting your abilities
[3:37:49] <+shivvey> ABUSE THE ARM BARS WOOLIE
[3:37:49] <CoffeeSlice> YEA
[3:37:54] <user_naim> ROOM: ETERNAL (good job tho for real)
[3:37:54] <%gunsrlove> yeyeye learning
[3:38:00] <%Fattness132> dashes are NOT invincible
[3:38:02] <turbofolk> Wasted blood punch
[3:38:08] <+CryptusMaximus> Good job using Blood Punch on the tiny imp instead of the massive HellKnight LUL
[3:38:11] <SyLuX45> This game kinda forces you to use all your tools
[3:38:13] <%paladinstarbuster> yeah lke that
[3:38:16] <ghostspartan80> ripatorium is gonna be helpful for woolz
[3:38:17] <%Lightwolfe> thank fuck
[3:38:17] <DeathByPoke7> yay
[3:38:18] <+johnny_gogo> @WoolieVersus grenades stagger big enemys
[3:38:19] <Shishi1205> Nice
[3:38:21] <knowyourenemy_97> Yes!
[3:38:21] <%Mrthefro> Clap
[3:38:22] <VJdarkworld> yatta
[3:38:27] <mark_collins45> Fun times ahead!
[3:38:28] <jeosadn> I think the issue is has to internalize that you can't dash through enemies
[3:38:29] <+toomuchsnarfsnarf> nixe
[3:38:29] <%FuqBoiSlim> EZ Clap
[3:38:30] <haitakaa> I hope Woolie never gets drafted into a real war
[3:38:30] <vVAstrAVv> gg
[3:38:31] <Shishi1205> Eternal is big juggling
[3:38:31] <ReiDuran> eyyyyy
[3:38:31] <zachztb> you did it
[3:38:32] <user_naim> Nice
[3:38:36] <awalr> first try
[3:38:37] <%Irridium> 1st try
[3:38:38] <Shishi1205> Time to Dante It up
[3:38:38] <user_naim> We do it!
[3:38:39] <cipher758> woolie done it
[3:38:45] <ghostspartan80> it only gets harder
[3:38:45] <andrei11dr> Maybe use those weapon points
[3:38:49] <%StaceMcGate> That was 4 instances of getting bodied by Hellknight?
[3:38:52] <+third_impact_762> go get your heretical mouse and controller set up and lets make the next encouters better now eh?
[3:38:56] <randominternetsurfer> that was far from the hardest fight in this level, lol.
[3:39:07] <%tearfuldevil> @StaceMcGate really more the caco, tbh
[3:39:18] <%Javaa01> Now you can go to those monkeybars on your right
[3:39:20] <ghostspartan80> this was the trial arena for the dash
[3:39:22] <Shishi1205> One ups dissapear once you get them?
[3:39:26] <ISkyHunterI> what difficulty is he playing ? uv ?
[3:39:28] <%StaceMcGate> yes
[3:39:29] <Shishi1205> From the map I mean
[3:39:33] <%tearfuldevil> @ISkyHunterI normal
[3:39:33] <+CryptusMaximus> This level basically tries to teach you "Use the dash. Or die."
[3:39:40] <%Lightwolfe> HMP
[3:39:40] <Monkeyweed21> secret to the right
[3:39:40] <%gunsrlove> GO RIGHT
[3:39:42] <resloxxx> --->

[3:39:46] <user_naim> secret fight go back
[3:39:48] <%WanderingSwordsman> go right
[3:39:50] <%Irridium> @Shishi1205 they don't disappear they just turn a darker shade of green
[3:39:53] <user_naim> monkey bars
[3:39:53] <AppleBoi85> go back for the gore nest
[3:39:58] <Shishi1205> Darker, cool
[3:40:00] <ghostspartan80> this and cultist base are the hardest for early level
[3:40:02] <knowyourenemy_97> Dash is your best friend, never forget that!
[3:40:06] <Monkeyweed21> arm bars
[3:40:06] <Agami23> way in the distance
[3:40:08] <%Javaa01> Look at the giant fuck off statues
[3:40:10] <%GeneralSCPatton> Air dash up to that tower
[3:40:11] <haitakaa> how's the frame rate on the PS4 pro?
[3:40:13] <user_naim> Yay
[3:40:16] <andrei11dr> I am kinda sad that this doesn't have all of the unique death animations that 2016 had ,you just kinda fall backwards
[3:40:23] <%kapcommunist> didnt have dash last time you tried

[3:43:12] <%GeneralSCPatton> Infinite monkey bars
[3:43:12] <ghostspartan80> as far as secret missions go these are pretty straight forward early on
[3:43:13] <+third_impact_762> or chain it but you dont have the skill to do it
[3:43:13] <CoffeeSlice> you can slow time
[3:43:13] <awalr> just sch√ºt demun
[3:43:14] <Sloth_Gus> ye dash glory
[3:43:15] <+johnny_gogo> Slow down time

[3:43:18] <knowyourenemy_97> Just shoot em up!
[3:43:19] <VJdarkworld> do the thing
[3:43:20] <%Zebroneath> Glory Kill refills your double jump, I believe
[3:43:21] <Kidbizzaro> you could try the heavy cannon if you wanna long range them
[3:43:21] <ISkyHunterI> @WoolieVersus gkory kills reser the dash and jump
[3:43:22] <%DianaTheAscian> cover shooting u where
[3:43:24] <+QuadraticGravity> glory kill gives you a reset
[3:43:24] <ralphfromdk> Use assault rifle to kill from range?
[3:43:25] <%Solidnick18> dash glory kill

[3:43:44] <+TheBigTaco> pain
[3:43:45] <Bodregg> NotLikeThis
[3:43:46] <Shishi1205> Maybe you should go gor it
[3:43:47] <JaseAdrift> Woolie please
[3:43:55] <%Solidnick18> good enough
[3:43:55] <randominternetsurfer> yes, but you can wait for them till they're close and glory kill them both.
[3:43:56] <jeosadn> Easy peasy

[3:44:08] <ISkyHunterI> oh boy can't wait for the purple gates LUL
[3:44:09] <%kapcommunist> ysysysy
[3:44:11] <Kidbizzaro> There are many paths to victory.
[3:44:12] <%GeneralSCPatton> YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO AIR RIP THEM
[3:44:12] <+TheBigTaco> it just works
[3:44:14] <+QuadraticGravity> Glory Kills give air resets
[3:44:16] <Shishi1205> You absolutely can do it with glory kills
[3:44:21] <Nano_osecond> woolie wanted to do the cool thing-
[3:44:23] <Bodregg> don't shoehorn yourself, remember that schut is always an option
[3:44:23] <+doc_ock_rokc> Bullets are effective means of damage
[3:44:27] <awalr> a lesson in pragmatism
[3:44:28] <Viewtiful_Rose> I mean that‚Äôs not what you were supposed to do but it worked
[3:44:28] <Agami23> i always find it funny when secret missions are as easy as "stop overthinking it man"
[3:44:28] <+fizzguy47> We got there
[3:44:30] <%DianaTheAscian> i suggest u do those off screen
[3:44:31] <CraftofPaper> Fuckin whatever works man
[3:44:31] <Mister_McDerp> if it works it works
[3:44:33] <%GeneralSCPatton> YOU CAN INFINITE THE MONKEY BARS
[3:44:40] <andrei11dr> Iea, the gates are going to be a problem
[3:44:40] <+QuadraticGravity> That was a tutorial for air resets like the old enemy step secret mission
[3:44:41] <%WanderingSwordsman> its fine, he got it
[3:44:41] <Shishi1205> Mision NOT DONE YET
[3:44:41] <+CryptusMaximus> Boy this will NOT go well once Woolie gets to the Marauders LUL
[3:44:44] <%gunsrlove> AirGlory Kills woolieGIRLS
[3:44:45] <Bodregg> gotta love that stock scream
[3:44:45] <ghostspartan80> demons will flank you so watch out
[3:44:46] <JaseAdrift> wow that is the only way ive seen someone do that challenge
[3:44:49] <venomryu> @WoolieVersus hi woolie
[3:44:51] <+MagicBeanBurrito> blue green to red orange
[3:44:52] <Revant_tillywink> mmmm plasma rifle
[3:44:55] <%FuqBoiSlim> LETS GO PLASMA RIFLE
[3:44:56] <Tuna_Can_0> plasma is actually useful this time
[3:45:02] <%paladinstarbuster> dont do that
[3:45:03] <jeosadn> THAT WORKS TOO THOUGH
[3:45:10] <%Javaa01> The GOOD Plasma Rifle
[3:45:12] <Nano_osecond> they become the new fodder tbh-
[3:45:16] <ghostspartan80> lovin that retro look
[3:45:18] <Bodregg> @WoolieVersus plasma is amazing in this game
[3:45:19] <%Irridium> typo LUL
[3:45:19] <user_naim> Good ol Rife
[3:45:19] <%Lightwolfe> oh no
[3:45:20] <Viewtiful_Rose> That‚Äôs the better way to do it tbh
[3:45:20] <%Gruhunchously> Palsma rifle
[3:45:21] <LoganPayne> oh my god i never noticed that
[3:45:26] <%Sir_Lavabeard> plasma rifle is op in this
[3:45:26] <Nano_osecond> anything that's not three times the size of you is fodder-
[3:45:27] <sleepy_pixels> ah yes, mortal kombats subpar cousin. Normal combat
[3:45:31] <alexandrecau> That's the way to do it but you don't air glory kill good enough, killing caco without that is just asking to get killed
[3:45:31] <knowyourenemy_97> it's the devs fault
[3:45:32] <heart_ablaze> CurseLit welcome to Quantum Dream HQ CurseLit
[3:45:35] <cipher758> plasma rife
[3:45:35] <mdkcde> The Rifle is SOOO much better than 2016
[3:45:36] <awalr> the audiovisual feedback on plasma is much more satisfying than 2016 too
[3:45:39] <andrei11dr> I actually never noticed that LUL
[3:45:39] <%tearfuldevil> woolie could have done the aerial glory kill, but i think its important for him to remember that SHOOTBANGS is a thing
[3:45:42] <+third_impact_762> dont roll the superchared unmodefied 1 tho
[3:45:45] <6beats> You may soon learn that it's always the best option
[3:45:45] <Tuna_Can_0> PogChamp
[3:45:46] <dekkitout> Rife with plasma
[3:45:49] <Bodregg> purple mode PogChamp
[3:45:51] <user_naim> fun yay
[3:45:51] <alexandrecau> woolie demon now
[3:45:53] <ralphfromdk> They went back to the OG design for the plasma instead of 2016 space gun
[3:46:02] <resloxxx> DOOT
[3:46:03] <Nomad94> never knew you could change the colors
[3:46:05] <%FuqBoiSlim> Woolie's on Demon Time üòà

[3:46:31] <ReiDuran> I hate that it gives you the weak points right at the start
[3:46:31] <JaseAdrift> DOOT GUY
[3:46:33] <andrei11dr> Skeledoot
[3:46:34] <%WanderingSwordsman> can also do it with sticky bombs
[3:46:35] <%Nekros4442> yeah GL with that
[3:46:44] <%Gruhunchously> ?Social distancing?
[3:46:44] <Agami23> that last part is important
[3:46:48] <%Javaa01> "Fucking MOVE" The enemy
[3:46:48] <MAX116030> With Woollie AIM I dont see this feasible for an hour
[3:46:50] <Nested_Dreams> You HAVE to dash or double jump
[3:46:52] <ghostspartan80> stickies also come in handy
[3:47:08] <dekkitout> DooT 2.0
[3:47:11] <cipher758> doot ETERNAL
[3:47:12] <alexandrecau> "defviation" as if they weren't all in on it
[3:47:18] <randominternetsurfer> OH MY GOD, PLEASE READ THEM LATER
[3:47:24] <%Gruhunchously> Deviated Preverts
[3:47:38] <Bodregg> @WoolieVersus just letting you know, the game WILL give you tutorials for bosses all the way up to the very end of the game if you don't turn them off at some point
[3:47:47] <dekkitout> They rip and tear -to their best ability-
[3:47:50] <DeathByPoke7> i didnt notice the face on his cannon
[3:48:01] <randominternetsurfer> @bodregg they'll need the tutorials.
[3:48:03] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:48:04] <Nomad94> @randominternetsurfer your attention span is laughable
[3:48:07] <%GeneralSCPatton> Use more slo mo
[3:48:16] <awalr> magenta palette is best girl
[3:48:17] <MasterTonberry23> Flame belch for armor
[3:48:25] <%BallerSwagBro9k> NotLikeThis
[3:48:29] <%Solidnick18> plasma Kreygasm
[3:48:32] <Bodregg> i just wanted to let them know, in case woolie doesn't want to get things like "shoot it until it dies" when he's about to go into the last encounter
[3:48:36] <%tearfuldevil> @alexandrecau while the people working directly for Samual Hayden are certianly complicit in what happened to earht, they don't seem to be working with hell at all
[3:48:42] <Nested_Dreams> Plasma go explode PogChamp
[3:48:45] <ghostspartan80> don't forget to flame belch. Also two glory kills refill blood punch
[3:48:53] <%kapcommunist> oh yeah i dig these HUD colors
[3:48:56] <Quicksilver295> The Marauder is gonna be fuuuuun
[3:49:02] <+Shubreaker> man woolie is gonna get smashed next level if he keeps this up
[3:49:06] <Viewtiful_Rose> The grenade launcher will destroy the shoulder things on the Revenant too just an FYI
[3:49:09] <andrei11dr> @bodregg But that's the best tutorial
[3:49:17] <user_naim> nice
[3:49:17] <DeathByPoke7> cross under
[3:49:22] <heart_ablaze> NICE
[3:49:22] <+mechslayer71> Flame belch @woolieversus
[3:49:22] <CoffeeSlice> YEYEYEYE
[3:49:24] <cipher758> DODGED
[3:49:25] <memes_are_cancer> Pog
[3:49:42] <Shishi1205> Flame them
[3:49:42] <%Gruhunchously> Rip and tear
[3:49:52] <Mister_McDerp> woolie forgot the triangle button
[3:49:53] <Reveresao> FIRE
[3:49:54] <Viewtiful_Rose> Ooooh maybe he‚Äôs getting a hang of the movement
[3:49:55] <%kapcommunist> nicely done!
[3:49:56] <%paladinstarbuster> remember blood punch
[3:49:57] <%FuqBoiSlim> the flame belch woolay
[3:50:07] <%GeneralSCPatton> MOAR FLAMES CurseLit CurseLit CurseLit CurseLit CurseLit CurseLit
[3:50:10] <+doc_ock_rokc> Man half life 2 sure is different from what I remember
[3:50:11] <Viewtiful_Rose> I think most people don‚Äôt realize how much crazy shit u can do movement wise in this game
[3:50:15] <+thesyndrome> just an FYI woolie, the flame belch basically doesn't do damage, but enemies shot while on fire drop armour, if you have anything less than full armour and flame belch isn't on cooldown, use it on the nearest thing you see then kill it
[3:50:17] <Mister_McDerp> jermaFireman
[3:50:22] <+Shubreaker> i love the gregorian chant when blood punch is charged
[3:50:22] <+GeneralHysterics> remembering the flame belch is super hard first run, cut him some slack
[3:50:38] <+Shubreaker> top 10 audio cues for sure
[3:50:43] <Jolnir> look at these pro gamers
[3:50:44] <+TheBigTaco> yeah, I barely used flame belch on my first run too
[3:50:47] <+mechslayer71> @generalhysterics Wasn‚Äôt for me but okay
[3:50:49] <Bodregg> LOOKADIS DUDE @Mister_McDerp
[3:51:12] <randominternetsurfer> @generalhysterics he'll have to get used to it if he wants to survive past the third and fourth levels.
[3:51:14] <+thesyndrome> @TheBigTaco same, it wasn't until like 1/3 of the game before I realized how helpful it was
[3:51:29] <CoffeeSlice> o no
[3:51:37] <ghostspartan80> the flaming meathook is so good
[3:51:39] <%StaceMcGate> IT BEGINS

[3:51:53] <Mister_McDerp> purple goo is the worst
[3:51:54] <%Reverend_Roscoe> The purp is the worst thing in the game, I think
[3:51:57] <%Solidnick18> it's da goop
[3:51:57] <+Shubreaker> @coffeeslice aaaaay i love your work
[3:51:58] <user_naim> countered

[3:52:48] <Shishi1205> Prohibited, No fun allowed goop
[3:52:50] <Mister_McDerp> putting the goo in to slow down the gameplay was a huge mistake

[3:53:37] <%Lightwolfe> if only there was a weapon capable of dealing large damage fast up close

[3:53:52] <Kidbizzaro> 10/10
[3:53:52] <VJdarkworld> smooth
[3:53:52] <Torgue_1> That smirk LUL
[3:53:53] <Louie_Salmon> I would bet that if you actually went through and did the math, this would be around a 40% accuracy rate overall
[3:53:54] <%CommanderSqueaks> Look at Woolie doing the mechanics
[3:53:54] <randominternetsurfer> HEAT WAVE
[3:53:55] <ghostspartan80> heat blast this ho
[3:53:55] <%gunsrlove> HEAT
[3:53:55] <awalr> PogChamp
[3:53:56] <Reveresao> blast
[3:53:56] <LoganPayne> Turn the beat back
[3:53:56] <%alpacasintophats> heat blast
[3:53:56] <mark_collins45> I never knew you could so that
[3:53:57] <dekkitout> Critical Thinking PogChamp
[3:53:57] <Shishi1205> Clasic
[3:53:58] <Darren716> Blast
[3:53:58] <andrei11dr> I clapped
[3:53:59] <Agami23> heat blast is really fun
[3:53:59] <Bodregg> @WoolieVersus microwave beam is cool, but complete dogshit
[3:54:01] <Mister_McDerp> microwave is pretty bad
[3:54:01] <Yummy_Nukes> HEAT BLAST
[3:54:02] <AntifaCatboy> HEAT BLAST
[3:54:02] <%Irridium> okay Heat Blast is the fucking shit
[3:54:03] <DeathByPoke7> heat blast
[3:54:04] <%gunsrlove> Microwave FUCKING SUCKS
[3:54:04] <randominternetsurfer> HEAT BLAST
[3:54:04] <ralphfromdk> And no, the tentacles do not respawn once dead, so retreading old ground is not that bad.
[3:54:06] <cipher758> prostrats
[3:54:07] <StarkAvKnark> blast most def
[3:54:08] <%Solidnick18> HEAT BLAST
[3:54:09] <LoganPayne> MICROWAVE SUCKS
[3:54:09] <Shishi1205> That one is horrible
[3:54:09] <Driftrift> You can use the chainsaw on tentacles
[3:54:11] <grimshuck> don't get the microwave beam
[3:54:13] <awalr> gotta blast
[3:54:13] <masterfire23> microwave is bad
[3:54:14] <MAX116030> blast
[3:54:15] <%GeneralSCPatton> Microwave is trash
[3:54:15] <%Javaa01> @WoolieVersus Microwave can be good, but it's hard to use correctly
[3:54:18] <Darren716> Never used wave
[3:54:20] <thorn0516> theres like 10 - 15 minutes of goop in a 20 hour game. The goop complaints are insanely overblown
[3:54:20] <AntifaCatboy> Microwave beam is the worst upgrade in the game.
[3:54:21] <%GraceTBM> HEAT BLAST IS SUPERIOR
[3:54:23] <%alpacasintophats> heat blast is better
[3:54:24] <randominternetsurfer> HEAT BLAST IS BETTER IN THIS GAME
[3:54:24] <dekkitout> Symmetra SeriousSloth
[3:54:25] <+GeneralHysterics> microwave is so bad, don't do it
[3:54:27] <ralphfromdk> Microwave beam is bad. Blast is where it's at.
[3:54:28] <Bodregg> beam is the WORST mod in the game and is almost worthless, but it's also cool
[3:54:28] <%CommanderSqueaks> Explode on death is good
[3:54:29] <zachztb> Nah Microwave sucks
[3:54:29] <%BallerSwagBro9k> U NEED HEAT BLAST OW
[3:54:32] <SyLuX45> Microwave is the worst ability in the game
[3:54:32] <%Irridium> Heat Blast was always good
[3:54:32] <%CommanderSqueaks> BOOM GO BOOM
[3:54:33] <Darren716> Blast is dope though
[3:54:34] <UvBenServed> Doom guy is fed
[3:54:35] <KatabolicRage> Microwave will be a massive dissapointment
[3:54:37] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> But he won't need to aim as hard with Microwave
[3:54:37] <LoganPayne> Heat blast is dope
[3:54:39] <%Sir_Lavabeard> microwave is not worth it
[3:54:40] <VJdarkworld> TOP HAS BEEN FED
[3:54:40] <+mechslayer71> Microwave beam is fuckin trash
[3:54:41] <+CryptusMaximus> Heat blast SLAPS in this game. Get it
[3:54:41] <T_Sasquatch> Personally i think 4 Arms is better Kappa
[3:54:42] <%Pillagius> Heatblast rocks!
[3:54:43] <+rowboat_girlyman> plasma beam is kinda bad
[3:54:44] <Bodregg> yeah that's ok
[3:54:44] <Agami23> missles good
[3:54:44] <6beats> Only for style points
[3:54:44] <+MagicBeanBurrito> micro or feed
[3:54:45] <Nomad94> I never used blast, only beam, worked fine
[3:54:48] <Mister_McDerp> missiles are great for bosses
[3:54:51] <andrei11dr> That's fine
[3:54:52] <duskrush> Doomguy's fed on mid
[3:54:53] <J87_fox> heat blast is shotgun disable weakpoont
[3:54:55] <randominternetsurfer> missiles aren't great in eternal.
[3:54:56] <%WanderingSwordsman> the master for heatblast is awesome
[3:54:57] <ghostspartan80> heat blast can help with your aim tho
[3:54:58] <KatabolicRage> heat blast is a lot better than it used to be
[3:55:02] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:55:03] <Shishi1205> Heat blast is pretty good, but sure missiles are good
[3:55:05] <Driftrift> CHAINSAW TENTACLES
[3:55:09] <Bodregg> heatblast fucks
[3:55:11] <+Spatulord> You can see where the tentacles will pop up, they make little streams off bubbles that are distinct from the other bubbles
[3:55:14] <ralphfromdk> Heat blast is like a shotgun mod for the plasma rifle
[3:55:17] <iwa5h4ck3d> Heat blast is strong
[3:55:20] <Viewtiful_Rose> Heat blast is arguably the best upgrade the game
[3:55:28] <mark_collins45> Purple menu looks good
[3:55:35] <T_Sasquatch> I can't believe im the only one that made a Ben 10 joke NotLikeThis. Boomers
[3:55:38] <ghostspartan80> nah flaming meathook tho
[3:55:46] <andrei11dr> No stun grenade this time because that shit was broken
[3:55:46] <T_Sasquatch> NotLikeThis
[3:55:46] <+The_Lunar_Paladin> Heat blast can destroy enemy weapons!
[3:55:48] <randominternetsurfer> @hugh_ns pretty sure that's Lock On Rockets.
[3:55:52] <Bodregg> flaming meathook i feel wins it since it's an extra flame belch
[3:56:05] <CoffeeSlice> naw
[3:56:07] <alexandrecau> making ben 10 jokes is like making digimon jokes, you should be ashamed
[3:56:08] <%Solidnick18> naw
[3:56:09] <memes_are_cancer> Not really?
[3:56:09] <%Zebroneath> You move VERY slow using Microwave.
[3:56:09] <%Irridium> not really
[3:56:10] <stormhawk9891> @T_Sasquatch 4 Arms was kinda lame tbh
[3:56:12] <Darren716> Not worth all the effort
[3:56:17] <ShmowzowKapow> microwave beam is horrible
[3:56:17] <+Spatulord> Flaming Meathook hands down takes it
[3:56:18] <Bodregg> high-level play actually favors remote detonation over lock-on
[3:56:18] <Mister_McDerp> microwave takes way too long to kill
[3:56:19] <+PenmanLupine> does it really look worth it?
[3:56:24] <%Solidnick18> Heat blast is the best thing with the mastery
[3:56:26] <dekkitout> Used for the occasional CC on a cleanup kill
[3:56:27] <Shishi1205> In a game where movement is king, that shit is worthless
[3:56:27] <+PenmanLupine> it's worth it if everyone standing still
[3:56:28] <KatabolicRage> Microwave takes a VERY long time to actually pop anything
[3:56:28] <ralphfromdk> Microwave is super shit untill fully upgraded. Blast is always good.
[3:56:36] <T_Sasquatch> @alexandrecau them fighting words
[3:56:38] <Picosunloaded> weaken enemies first then beam them @WoolieVersus
[3:56:39] <%tearfuldevil> @alexandrecau don't put digimon on the elvel of ben 10, digimon, at least comparetively, had CLASS
[3:56:45] <Viewtiful_Rose> It‚Äôs sucks shit woolie. It seems cool but for majority of the game it‚Äôs shit
[3:56:49] <%tearfuldevil> @alexandrecau also its had a bunch of pretty fun video games
[3:56:49] <+Comradeiota> Microwave is STRICTLY an execute on low health enemies. Otherwise it takes forever.
[3:57:00] <T_Sasquatch> @stormhawk9891 female 4 arms tho
[3:57:14] <+Kirbachev> Microwave looked cool. Ended up regretting taking it first.
[3:57:15] <+Bailey__gaming> micro missles are my fave
[3:57:16] <SyLuX45> Takes forever and eats all your ammo
[3:57:19] <%Javaa01> Yeah, you have to soften up enemies first before you explode them with Microwave
[3:57:25] <Agami23> jesus look at what your walking on its so fucked
[3:57:29] <LoganPayne> stomping on corpses WutFace
[3:57:37] <%punch_ghost> YO SHINJI GET IN THE ROBOT
[3:57:57] <alexandrecau> Deadpool game had that battery to power sentinel arm too

[3:59:06] <VJdarkworld> PatStaresAt
[3:59:07] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat doesn't count, he doesn't even like music.

[3:59:20] <heart_ablaze> pat hates everything
[3:59:20] <andrei11dr> Pat is barely human tho
[3:59:20] <%punch_ghost> Some kind of inhuman goblin-like creature
[3:59:23] <+CryptusMaximus> Doomguy to some chicks in his crib: "I found this album in the bowels of HELL ITSELF"
[3:59:27] <Yummy_Nukes> not as short as he is
[3:59:28] <Reveresao> just wait
[3:59:30] <cipher758> red dwarf bad
[3:59:32] <Viewtiful_Rose> @agami23 cuz it is vinyl is more big than CDs the market got them I‚Äôd bigger too
[3:59:33] <Quicksilver295> I'm not convinced Pat even likes music
[3:59:34] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat's unable to understand the idea of liking non-videogame music he didn't hear as a child. He doesn't count.
[3:59:36] <%Solidnick18> More history
[3:59:37] <+QuadraticGravity> woolie is about to get his ass blown
[3:59:38] <Shishi1205> These ones are big beefy

[4:03:46] <thorn0516> who fuckin cares about the lore art
[4:03:50] <InfinityCircuit> What if Angels also had free will and could be assholes 2020

[4:03:56] <Johannen> How is Woolie feeling about the new Doom?
[4:03:57] <%Irridium> the lore art is super sick
[4:04:04] <memes_are_cancer> Hallelujah?
[4:04:05] <mark_collins45> KHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN
[4:04:06] <%CommanderSqueaks> God is an alien.
[4:04:07] <vVAstrAVv> reggi is gub boi
[4:04:08] <+DesertPenguin> Lore art is a metal album cover every fucking time
[4:04:09] <%derap41> What is scifi angels
[4:04:12] <andrei11dr> Can't wait for actual Satan in the DLC or possibly the next game
[4:04:15] <+third_impact_762> your homies worshiping cthulu aliens
[4:04:16] <Mister_McDerp> theyre the old school eldritch angels
[4:04:19] <Agami23> they have halos
[4:04:19] <alexandrecau> cenobites
[4:04:23] <dekkitout> Yea- I'd crusade of those dudes...
[4:04:24] <%FuqBoiSlim> can we get an amen from the congregation???
[4:04:25] <%doomerskeletor13> Eldritch angels
[4:04:25] <+OUTheTeam> well biblical aliens are weird as fuxk
[4:04:26] <+Shubreaker> just a little disappointed that we'll never get Doomslayer tearing Lucifer in half
[4:04:30] <+VidulaSaix> All angels are sci fi angels Kappa
[4:04:31] <%RadicalWeegee> THERE HOT IS WHAT THEY ARE! : D
[4:04:32] <rubbishbinge> Shaped like a friend
[4:04:32] <mark_collins45> The Mormons were right. God was an alien.
[4:04:33] <duskrush> there isn't really a distinction between biblical Hell and this game's Hell. You go there and they torture your soul forever, then some asshole with a chainsaw runs by and kills your torturer and you're like "thanks bro"
[4:04:34] <%CommanderSqueaks> Those are approaching some old testament angels.
[4:04:42] <Bodregg> :)
[4:04:43] <%FuqBoiSlim> be humble
[4:04:44] <%Lightwolfe> and it is

[4:04:53] <thorn0516> yea wow chat that was so cool, definitely worth interrupting the stream for Kappa Kappa
[4:04:55] <+DesertPenguin> Hey Woolie, what are your thoughts on using the classic DOOM view with the gun in the center?

[4:06:24] <cipher758> green equals weed, therefore good

[4:13:36] <%Javaa01> @WoolieVersus We told you about the Keyboard, you need ALL your fingers on inputs in this game, no exceptions
[4:13:37] <+DesertPenguin> The slow-down rune is a total waste until later
[4:13:37] <Viewtiful_Rose> Plasma bruh it‚Äôs good
[4:13:37] <ghostravens> WHAT I LEARNED IN TRAINING MODE IS

[4:13:53] <SleepyMaribo> Plasma Gun!
[4:13:54] <%0rond> this game is like operating a a complex machine
[4:13:55] <+DesertPenguin> I would've gotten the one where you do glory kills from further away. That's really useful
[4:14:00] <%paladinstarbuster> missles are better
[4:14:00] <%punch_ghost> Plasma
[4:14:01] <+RyanTheRecluse> biggest advice would be step sode to side instead of front to back
[4:14:01] <+johnny_gogo> spider gun is mena
[4:14:03] <+Walopoh> Plasma Gun is really useful for this
[4:14:04] <%Fattness132> Woolie the precision bolt while jumping is great for destroying weak points
[4:14:05] <%CommanderSqueaks> @woolieversus Just imagine a style meter, always go for that S rank.
[4:14:07] <+OUTheTeam> you can destroy the weak point with a scope shot
[4:14:07] <%Solidnick18> you can also snipe them
[4:14:08] <%doomerskeletor13> Rip and tear Darlington
[4:14:10] <+Kirbachev> This is like the FPS equivalent of that fighting they did on one Fisticuffs that had like a dozen fuckin' gauges to keep track of.
[4:14:11] <ghostspartan80> keep your distance from heavy demons
[4:14:11] <Reveresao> full auto woolie
[4:14:12] <+JingKaisean> this is the real game now
[4:14:13] <%Lightwolfe> stickies on weakpoints and plasma/missiles for DPS
[4:14:13] <%punch_ghost> Plasma is your SMG
[4:14:15] <%gunsrlove> ONLY 2nd LEVEL BOYS
[4:14:17] <dosan121> 2 level still
[4:14:18] <Josef_Stryker> This game really is like a First Person DMC
[4:14:18] <+DesertPenguin> Play on Ultra-Violence they said. It'll be normal mode they said....
[4:14:23] <raveous> yeah keeping that blaster on the spiders really fucks ye
[4:14:29] <+thesyndrome> !uptime
[4:14:29] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 4 hours and 22 minutes
[4:14:29] <%CommanderSqueaks> To be fair, this is the first battle that tripped me up, too.
[4:14:35] <randominternetsurfer> @gunsrlove AND ON HURT ME PLENTY too.
[4:14:37] <+DesertPenguin> DOn't forget about your PLASMA RIFLE. High rate of fire
[4:14:37] <%J0RD4NPR1M3> missles cant destroy weakpoints
[4:14:42] <black_pariah> Chat what level is this?
[4:14:45] <%0rond> don't worry woolie, you are doing perfectly fine, this game is A LOT to digest
[4:14:48] <%CommanderSqueaks> @black_pariah 2
[4:14:49] <+CryptusMaximus> Archvile: "Lemme in coach"
[4:14:53] <+third_impact_762> wait wait wait, this IS uv? not hmp?
[4:14:57] <%doomerskeletor13> Oh yeah for sure this took me a couple tries on my first playthrough
[4:14:59] <%Pillagius> I hope Woolie playing on something like Ultra-Violence
[4:14:59] <%Fattness132> this is hmp
[4:15:02] <+DesertPenguin> Level 3
[4:15:06] <+Shubreaker> oh man this isn't even ultraviolence?
[4:15:09] <Bodregg> i can't wait to see woolie attempt final sin
[4:15:13] <%doomerskeletor13> This is still the 2nd level
[4:15:14] <+mechslayer71> The people who suggested UV either didn‚Äôt watch the first play through or were complete retards tbh
[4:15:16] <randominternetsurfer> @shubreaker yes
[4:15:17] <ghostspartan80> the first proper arena imo
[4:15:25] <%GeneralSCPatton> @mechslayer71 Agreed
[4:15:27] <+DesertPenguin> Oh yea, Exultia takes you to another planet
[4:15:27] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh god, he's using the shotgun as a crutch, I think EVERYONE who played Doom 2016 made this mistake (me included). It's so easy to try relying on it.
[4:15:27] <%Pillagius> Ultra Nightmare with controller would be... Not impossible but very unenjoyable
[4:15:29] <mark_collins45> Yeah this is the first real motherfucker arena
[4:15:41] <%FuqBoiSlim> Controller aim NotLikeThis
[4:15:42] <%Irridium> he sleeping on the plasma rifle
[4:15:44] <SyLuX45> Ultra Violence is Normal mode. Ultra Nightmare is just fuck you all the time lol
[4:15:59] <+mechslayer71> @commandersqueaks It‚Äôs actually way better in this game tho cuz of Sticky bombs
[4:16:04] <Bodregg> @WoolieVersus plasma rifle is incredible in eternal, give it the college try
[4:16:04] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:16:07] <randominternetsurfer> @pillagius Nah, I beat the game on Nightmare on console and had fun. just get good tbh
[4:16:08] <+Shubreaker> maybe it's just Woolie but i really couldn't tell the difference
[4:16:09] <+DesertPenguin> People saying Ultra Violence is Normal are the kind of people that say Git Gud for Dark Souls
[4:16:13] <%Solidnick18> plasma gun
[4:16:14] <%KeslGames> does he not have flame belch?
[4:16:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> @keslgames Ye do.

[4:16:34] <%CommanderSqueaks> The Shotgun is a CRUTCH Woolie, don't rely on it as much.
[4:16:36] <+QuadraticGravity> Man just turn down your sensitivity down
[4:16:37] <+JingKaisean> he does, but he needs aim
[4:16:37] <ghostspartan80> keep weapon switching
[4:16:38] <+third_impact_762> @DesertPenguin oh so people who are right about things, gotcha
[4:16:39] <%Fattness132> its a burst of flame
[4:16:41] <%Fattness132> not sustained
[4:16:41] <%gunsrlove> Yeah no, good thing no Ultra Violance LUL LUL
[4:16:44] <brianthe12th> Glad to see you playing this Devil Game Woolie, what difficulty is this?
[4:16:45] <%KeslGames> Flame belch is a must
[4:16:47] <%Lightwolfe> willingness to lab punchgames forever but the refusal on the m+kb
[4:16:48] <%paladinstarbuster> Blood punchis VERY STRONG
[4:16:49] <CookieCutter007> gotta bunny hop bby
[4:16:49] <+CommanderSqueaks> Woolie, just press buttons, press ALL of the buttons.
[4:16:50] <Zbyrd0961> use it on staggered targets before glory kill
[4:16:50] <AntifaCatboy> @DesertPenguin yes
[4:16:50] <%Solidnick18> gotta manage alot of stuff
[4:16:53] <%GraceTBM> don't worry it takes time to get used to the flame belch
[4:16:54] <+DesertPenguin> Wow the community on this difficulty thing is fucking rediculous
[4:16:55] <+RyanTheRecluse> best to use it on the mob enemies
[4:17:01] <andrei11dr> Auto shotgun melts big boys @woolieversus
[4:17:02] <+YabbaTroll> flamebelch is the introduction for other moves
[4:17:04] <%CommanderSqueaks> If you don't know what to do, press a weapon button.
[4:17:05] <vVAstrAVv> you know easy mode has been selectible the whole time right lpl
[4:17:08] <%Pillagius> @randominternetsurfer oh, and I beat on Ultra-Nightmare on PC and well... IMO it's the only way to play it :D
[4:17:09] <black_pariah> never not be going in
[4:17:15] <+IncredibleMeh> This part is grueling when you're getting used to the game
[4:17:18] <+QuadraticGravity> 90% of your issues are overcorrection, lowering sensitivity would help
[4:17:20] <%doomerskeletor13> This is the area that trips a lot of people up
[4:17:21] <+CryptusMaximus> It does take a while to get into the groove of managing all the new mechanics. This is a good practice arena TBH
[4:17:42] <+cvp5127> no scope?
[4:17:44] <%CommanderSqueaks> To be fair everyone, the HARDEST hurdle this game has is learning and remembering to use ALL of the many many many options you always have. Once you can train yourself past that mental roadblock, the game gets SO much easier.
[4:17:49] <ghostspartan80> oh man when the mancubi and whiplashes come in...
[4:17:51] <brianthe12th> This game's hard af , moreso than 2016. The normal difficulty is hurt me plenty
[4:17:53] <HairyRavioliToad> vineHard DEVIL vineHard GAMES vineHard
[4:18:02] <%GeneralSCPatton> @cvp5127 What scope?
[4:18:04] <+rowboat_girlyman> god help woolie when he gets to the slayer gate
[4:18:08] <+Shubreaker> either lowering sensitivity or just learning how to ease stick tilt would help
[4:18:13] <AntifaCatboy> Even the devs of this game say that the game is meant to be played on Nightmare.
[4:18:14] <%Pillagius> @CommanderSqueaks yeap. That's the trick you gotta learn the hard way :D
[4:18:17] <andrei11dr> Also there's fuel around the corner, yoy can just chainsaw one of the spiders
[4:18:18] <Josef_Stryker> @CommanderSqueaks Agreed. As soon as you master the mechanics of this game you'll be able to channel the Doom Slayer properly.
[4:18:22] <%FuqBoiSlim> blood punch ready
[4:18:30] <+DesertPenguin> Meant to be played doesn't mean it's normal mode
[4:18:31] <%CommanderSqueaks> @josef_stryker Almost like DMC!
[4:18:31] <SyLuX45> I die the most to Mancubus cause of their AOE slam does so much dmg
[4:18:53] <Josef_Stryker> @CommanderSqueaks Indeed. You gotta ease yourself in first before you can do combo.
[4:18:58] <+Shubreaker> dang forastero too
[4:18:59] <+DesertPenguin> They say meant to be played because they know the majority of their playerbase will prefer a harder challenge
[4:19:03] <%doomerskeletor13> The mantra that helped me a lot is never stop moving
[4:19:04] <%CommanderSqueaks> You know, Pat is wrong often, but him telling Woolie to play this game like DMC may have been the most correct he's ever been ever.
[4:19:06] <+TheBigTaco> I'm back, how's it going lads?
[4:19:13] <%GeneralSCPatton> @shubreaker Yeah, he's definitely whipping the reticle around in big chunks instead of sliding it right where it needs to be.
[4:19:15] <+DesertPenguin> Doesn't make it the norm
[4:19:26] <+DesertPenguin> Sensitivity should go down then?
[4:19:28] <+OUTheTeam> PogChamp
[4:19:29] <Josef_Stryker> Pat is full of awful takes but when he makes a good point he makes a damn good point
[4:19:38] <Reveresao> basic Shotgun shots against med and beg boys is not the play
[4:19:42] <black_pariah> you gone learn today woolie, game's gonna teach you
[4:19:44] <+CryptusMaximus> Yeah woolie needs to learn Stick Tilt discipline. I don't say that to shit on him either. He obviously doesn't play many shooters but it would help him tremendously to practice aiming and find a good sensitivity setting off stream
[4:19:45] <+JingKaisean> maybe sensitivity... but it's more about adjustment
[4:19:46] <ghostspartan80> ultra violence would be hell for him anyways
[4:19:48] <%CommanderSqueaks> So, is Woolie gonna have to break out that mutant controller/mouse setup?
[4:19:52] <%Pillagius> @CommanderSqueaks god damn it! now I know what doom lacks! Style-meter!
[4:19:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> Are we going to need the cube?
[4:20:03] <%CommanderSqueaks> I think we may need the cube guys.
[4:20:10] <+third_impact_762> @CommanderSqueaks he shoulda started with it
[4:20:11] <+MagicBeanBurrito> the cube
[4:20:11] <Viewtiful_Rose> I don‚Äôt think he can with a PS4
[4:20:12] <knowyourenemy_97> Using a regular punch is an insult to your enemies and yourself.
[4:20:13] <+DesertPenguin> You can do three of those grenades in a row really quickly
[4:20:18] <+cvp5127> why does this look so slow?
[4:20:18] <%Gruhunchously> The C U B E
[4:20:21] <Josef_Stryker> I wish this game had a Void like DMC5.
[4:20:21] <%CommanderSqueaks> @hugh_ns Naw, you can totes plug a mouse into a PS4.
[4:20:29] <Josef_Stryker> Unless u count the Kill Room in the Hub World
[4:20:29] <PeteyMcPickle> FLAMETHROWER
[4:20:32] <RunningNGunning> SourPls
[4:20:38] <Viewtiful_Rose> Oooh ok was not aware of that @commandersqueaks
[4:20:43] <CoffeeSlice> LUL
[4:20:45] <+VidulaSaix> LUL
[4:20:46] <+DesertPenguin> Shotgun is useless against larger enemies
[4:20:47] <SyLuX45> Game feels so slow without Adrenaline perk lol
[4:20:48] <Josef_Stryker> LUL
[4:20:48] <+toomuchsnarfsnarf> lUL
[4:20:48] <black_pariah> shotgun is not the problem solver in eternal
[4:20:49] <ghostspartan80> plasma maybe
[4:20:51] <+DesertPenguin> You need more DPS
[4:20:53] <HairyRavioliToad> KermiePls
[4:20:57] <HairyRavioliToad> ah damn
[4:20:57] <+JingKaisean> use every weapon
[4:20:58] <%CommanderSqueaks> Reggie's coaching may be able to make up for the LP tax.
[4:21:01] <Bodregg> @WoolieVersus plasma
[4:21:01] <+DesertPenguin> BIG ENEMIES = USE HIGH DPS WEAPONS
[4:21:01] <raveous> I really do think that Woolie could do this in UV, if only because difficulty in the game seems to mainly change damage taken, which would just mean that Woolie would have to dodge and strafe a bit more
[4:21:09] <KatabolicRage> the plasma gun is much better in this game, it's a real workhorse with the highest ammo pool
[4:21:09] <grimshuck> you have another weapon Woolie
[4:21:12] <brianthe12th> I guess I'm a slow learner, but this game takes more than 1 playthrough to 'master'. I'm currently on my 4th on Nightmare.
[4:21:14] <andrei11dr> Woolie refusing to use plasma
[4:21:14] <+DesertPenguin> plasma rifle
[4:21:14] <Nested_Dreams> Kinda sad, but cube might be necessary to not feel hindered by missing shots
[4:21:14] <%CommanderSqueaks> Woolie, how dare you think you can rest for a MILISECOND.
[4:21:15] <%gunsrlove> Clutch
[4:21:16] <CoffeeSlice> PLASMA
[4:21:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> Do you hear THAT MUSIC? NEVER STOP UNTIL IT IS DONE.
[4:21:25] <%CommanderSqueaks> RIP AND TEAR
[4:21:32] <%Hueburt_Dinklesprout> wooliePOYO
[4:21:34] <+DesertPenguin> that's wht they're there for
[4:21:36] <warmnoid> don't stop moving~
[4:21:37] <Bodregg> plasma time
[4:21:38] <ghostspartan80> ultra violence in this game is like nightmare in 2016
[4:21:43] <CoffeeSlice> plasma GOOD
[4:21:45] <%KeslGames> Use flame belch on scrubs
[4:21:49] <%CommanderSqueaks> This game will PUNISH you if you try to take a breather in the middle of battle.
[4:21:49] <+Shubreaker> it just kills me to see him move the L and R stick almost separately
[4:21:50] <user_naim> gate will be a fuck
[4:21:52] <%punch_ghost> YE YE YE
[4:21:55] <raveous> this is true, Doom 2016 was a cake walk compared to this
[4:21:55] <+third_impact_762> if he had started playing this game with a mouse, he'd be playing completly differently because of being used to aiming somewhat well rather than spray and pray for glory kills
[4:22:01] <Viewtiful_Rose> Yes plasma bitch
[4:22:11] <raveous> enemies in Doom 2016 were just really not threatening
[4:22:11] <jaygee303> @shubreaker It‚Äôs his left and right thing
[4:22:11] <%FuqBoiSlim> I shouldn't even be clowning woolie too hard cuz this is just gonna be me when the Wonderful 101 remaster comes out LUL
[4:22:21] <Josef_Stryker> The only breather you can have is if u keep moving
[4:22:25] <+DesertPenguin> You need to move around and look as you do it
[4:22:25] <brianthe12th> This game has tons of new mechanics to get used to
[4:22:25] <andrei11dr> Fire indeed hot
[4:22:26] <CoffeeSlice> YEA
[4:22:26] <Josef_Stryker> U can't sit still
[4:22:29] <+toomuchsnarfsnarf> YEYEYEYE

[4:22:43] <%FuqBoiSlim> you....did it
[4:22:43] <black_pariah> the tech is there is no tech, go in
[4:22:44] <%Visorak6> IT ONLY GETS HARDER
[4:22:49] <%0rond> you need a shot of coffee
[4:22:50] <Them00n> We haven't even gotten to a slayer gate yet.
[4:22:52] <+Shubreaker> Boi you don't even KNOW
[4:22:52] <+RyanTheRecluse> just joined the stream before this fight, does Woolie know the chainsaw refills the first pip?
[4:22:52] <user_naim> SECOND LEVEL
[4:22:53] <+third_impact_762> why aim and hit when you can panic and miss
[4:22:54] <vVAstrAVv> youre doing good woolie lpl
[4:22:56] <%BallerSwagBro9k> U AINT SEEN NOTHING
[4:22:57] <+DakotaMacDoodle> Untill its Done
[4:22:57] <Viewtiful_Rose> It‚Äôs harder than Doom 2016 by a lot
[4:23:00] <%0rond> playing this game is a legit workout for the brain
[4:23:00] <+CryptusMaximus> This is definitely the "Learn the mechanics" stage LUL
[4:23:02] <%Gruhunchously> People complained that Doom 1016 was too easy
[4:23:03] <iwa5h4ck3d> It gets harder but you get more upgrades
[4:23:04] <+green715> Easy to forget about the flame
[4:23:04] <RunningNGunning> GUNTRICKSWORDGUNTRICKSWORD
[4:23:05] <%GraceTBM> @WoolieVersus seconding that your issues are overcorrection and lowering sensitivity might help
[4:23:05] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:23:08] <Reveresao> the GATE is coming
[4:23:12] <%KeslGames> Glory kill less, FLAME BELCH MORE
[4:23:13] <Lordbahamut780> This game forces you to get gud
[4:23:15] <%doomerskeletor13> Doom gon give it to ya
[4:23:16] <Viewtiful_Rose> Probably one of the most legit hard mainstream FPS in probably a decade
[4:23:19] <grimshuck> Oh man I can't wait for the slayer gate
[4:23:20] <%CommanderSqueaks> SWORDTRICKROYALGUNSWORD
[4:23:21] <Zbyrd0961> flame
[4:23:22] <brianthe12th> protip, if you can see a revenant, arachnotron, etc from afar, use your scope and blast their weapons off
[4:23:23] <ghostspartan80> you need to get into the groove of the loop
[4:23:24] <+OUTheTeam> switch your weapon mods a bunch too
[4:23:24] <memes_are_cancer> Slayer gate is gonna be fun
[4:23:26] <+sleepymastiff> never lose your aggression
[4:23:27] <%LCLSmoothie> YOU THINK THATS HARD?? THIS IS JUST THE TUTORIAL LEVEL!!
[4:23:28] <brianthe12th> before going in
[4:23:30] <mark_collins45> ABC Always Be Chainsawing
[4:23:32] <+third_impact_762> #1 should be hit targets better
[4:23:32] <Skullamancer> Make sure to use your weapon addons for the bigger enemies.
[4:23:33] <ghostravens> this is the equivalent of changing styles as dante
[4:23:34] <+johnny_gogo> Doom eternal you can breath while you run edition
[4:23:34] <+Shubreaker> u forgot chainsaw
[4:23:35] <vVAstrAVv> its an mmo. shooting is your autoattack. you need your cds lol
[4:23:35] <user_naim> GUNTRICKSWORD
[4:23:36] <Reveresao> Reme,ber you have FULL AUTO for shotgun
[4:23:36] <dekkitout> Also Fire + Chainsaw
[4:23:37] <mdkcde> flame belch then glorykill for easy mode
[4:23:39] <+OUTheTeam> you can melt arachnatrons with auto shotty
[4:23:42] <+DesertPenguin> NO YOU MUST DO ALL OF IT
[4:23:44] <%CommanderSqueaks> Nooo
[4:23:45] <+sleepymastiff> cautious but active
[4:23:46] <+QuadraticGravity> @WoolieVersus for real consider lowering sensitivity
[4:23:47] <%FuqBoiSlim> Id saw too many videos of people facefucking 2016 with the ssg and gauss cannon and said enough is enough
[4:23:49] <+frankthetank285> woolie welcome to my bid
[4:23:50] <HairyRavioliToad> Yeah start with one thing, then juggle more and more balls
[4:23:51] <grimshuck> @brianthe12th that requires aim
[4:23:51] <+third_impact_762> @WoolieVersus start with aiming
[4:23:52] <%CommanderSqueaks> Reggie, no, you have to use all of it.
[4:23:55] <+linSP> Did woolie see king Allant yet
[4:23:57] <+FennecZephyr> @WoolieVersus Using flame belch on an enemy just before glorykilling it gives you a nice chunk of armor too
[4:23:59] <%CommanderSqueaks> Some enemies will just eat certain damage types.
[4:24:01] <+RyanTheRecluse> not really
[4:24:01] <%BinaryFireball> glory kills are SUPER important
[4:24:03] <+agoaj> Glory Kills or feed
[4:24:05] <ghostspartan80> first three levels are pretty challenging to be fair. Especially on nightmare
[4:24:12] <+strakillias> Woolie, you can totally flame belch someone that is stunned before glory killing them
[4:24:16] <%Javaa01> No, flame ALWAYS
[4:24:18] <mark_collins45> you get a minimal amount of health when you chainsaw
[4:24:18] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @KeslGames
[4:24:21] <+QuadraticGravity> No?? Flame ALWAYS Reggie
[4:24:21] <+frankthetank285> woolie welcome to my biggest problem with this game don't play the way you want just do the checklist and win battle
[4:24:22] <mdkcde> flame before chainsaw or glory
[4:24:22] <randominternetsurfer> the plasma gun is good for heavies.
[4:24:22] <+RyanTheRecluse> blood punch is probably the least important of the resource square
[4:24:24] <Skullamancer> and use the chainsaw for ammo refill often because eternal gives you a lot of fuel
[4:24:26] <%CommanderSqueaks> Always be flaming.
[4:24:26] <+greenfall> takes a while to learn the dance
[4:24:27] <CoffeeSlice> KOBE
[4:24:28] <%RadicalWeegee> In this game you cant stay with a single weapon anymore , not like Doom 2016 gotta keep switching
[4:24:29] <HairyRavioliToad> PogChamp

[4:24:33] <vVAstrAVv> flame any Time really

[4:24:34] <%doomerskeletor13> Blood punch can save your ass if you save it for the big boys

[4:24:35] <%Gruhunchously> Get that health out of it's butt
[4:24:38] <brianthe12th> @grimshuck better to aim from a safe distance
[4:24:48] <HairyRavioliToad> We Celeste boys

[4:24:49] <ghostspartan80> bloodpunch for those cyber mancubi

[4:25:19] <+DesertPenguin> just walk forward a bit and you'll see big video games
[4:25:22] <vVAstrAVv> hes not using blood punch on small fries intentionally
[4:25:25] <+TheBigTaco> theres definitely gonna be an icon alright KAPPA
[4:25:31] <+DesertPenguin> I mean there was already Extra Lives lol
[4:25:32] <+Aeoneth> Plague made the same call and lamented it
[4:25:35] <%FuqBoiSlim> This is the Dustforce of FPS games
[4:25:44] <mark_collins45> those things are dumb. I feel like those refills were added late in development because they made the gaps too big.
[4:25:49] <%doomerskeletor13> Nice
[4:25:50] <user_naim> uptime!
[4:25:50] <%KeslGames> Oh god I don't want to watch what happens if Woolie does this slayer gate
[4:25:52] <+CryptusMaximus> Oh boy don't go to the purple spot
[4:25:53] <%0rond> this game is actually super leninant on platforming, you can fly if you actually fully use your mobility
[4:26:04] <+DesertPenguin> As soon as you get the health it's gone
[4:26:06] <%CommanderSqueaks> @keslgames He's not ready.
[4:26:11] <SyLuX45> Oh god the Slayer Gates
[4:26:14] <user_naim> !uptime
[4:26:14] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 4 hours and 33 minutes
[4:26:17] <knowyourenemy_97> get more armor
[4:26:21] <%doomerskeletor13> ..and it‚Äôs gone
[4:26:21] <%CommanderSqueaks> Woolie, try the slayer gate for 5 minutes and then leave it alone.
[4:26:25] <ghostspartan80> slayer gate gonna be rough since all of them introduce enemies you'll face on the next level
[4:26:26] <Shishi1205> BEEFY
[4:26:27] <%GeneralSCPatton> ALWAYS FLAME BEFORE GLORY KILL OR CHAINSAW
[4:26:28] <sendart> would be nice if there was a way to get armor LUL
[4:26:35] <%doomerskeletor13> Oh god is their a slayer gate in this level
[4:26:40] <iwa5h4ck3d> Use the flame belch more!
[4:26:43] <%CommanderSqueaks> @ghostspartan80 But you get some GOOOOD shit if you beat it.
[4:26:44] <masterfire23> the purple ui looks kinda psychedelic
[4:26:47] <user_naim> @lewdskeletor13 yeah
[4:26:51] <+DesertPenguin> It saved when you pikced up the big battery thing
[4:26:52] <+TheBigTaco> IT SAVES AFTER EVERY ENCOUNTER
[4:26:57] <+TheBigTaco> sorry caps
[4:26:57] <+VidulaSaix> Too much devil games
[4:26:57] <CoffeeSlice> SHIT'S INTENSE
[4:26:59] <memes_are_cancer> Take 5?
[4:27:00] <%0rond> flame belch is probably weaker on a controller since you can't quickly whip it around to hit a large group around you
[4:27:01] <HairyRavioliToad> Good show
[4:27:01] <DeathByPoke7> the game is very intense
[4:27:04] <Tuna_Can_0> ggs :)
[4:27:07] <cipher758> doomed
[4:27:07] <+toomuchsnarfsnarf> game is super intense
[4:27:08] <Cybermancer> @WoolieVersus Use the little zombie enemies between fights as ways to refill armor and ammo
[4:27:09] <ghostspartan80> oh for sure slayer gates have great arenas so they're super fun
[4:27:09] <+NWannabe> Should I do cookies and milk or hot dog and soda for dinner?
[4:27:11] <%Javaa01> There's about 20 minutes left in this level
[4:27:11] <%Ecchigun> Gg
[4:27:14] <%CommanderSqueaks> Kudos to Coach Reggie.
[4:27:17] <%Ecchigun> GG get paid
[4:27:22] <%DianaTheAscian> calling it?
[4:27:25] <+RyTYoung> @nwannabe Cookies and milk for dinner?!
[4:27:26] <Josef_Stryker> Don't feel too discouraged Woolie. This game probably kicked everyone's ass when they first played it.
[4:27:34] <+DesertPenguin> We done?
[4:27:35] <%CommanderSqueaks> Checkpoints are fine.
[4:27:36] <+NWannabe> It's healthy milk
[4:27:45] <%KeslGames> KeslGames subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! I'm subbing just to tell you to use Flame Belch obsessively
[4:27:46] <%0rond> yeah this game is an intense actually workout for the brain
[4:27:49] <+NWannabe> Like that boost stuff
[4:27:49] <ghostspartan80> the ripatorium exists for this reason I guess
[4:27:53] <+Taglog7> back to normal reality
[4:28:09] <Tuna_Can_0> SourPls
[4:28:13] <+T_Rep> what difficulty is he currently on?
[4:28:15] <%GeneralSCPatton> Cadance of Hyrule's greatest banger
[4:28:15] <%Javaa01> @WoolieVersus I think if you do level select now your progress in the current level is erased though, so you can't do cleanup while you have a level in progress
[4:28:15] <+DesertPenguin> Exultia is Part 1 of that level, you're on Part 2. It's almost over
[4:28:18] <+greenfall> checkpoints are plentifull in this game
[4:28:29] <+DesertPenguin> Javaa you sure?
[4:28:30] <zocano> Are they done or just taking a break
[4:28:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> @legacy0117 Oh boy
[4:28:42] <%KeslGames> @zocano Taking a break
[4:28:44] <HairyRavioliToad> Oh this is a dope cover
[4:28:48] <+DesertPenguin> I thought you could if you complete the level you go back to. Otherwise "Continue" will go to the level you went back for
[4:28:55] <randominternetsurfer> @legacy0117 you got to witness demonic soul extraction.
[4:28:57] <%JustYudha> It literally says brb._.
[4:29:01] <+dukenux> yeyeye
[4:29:01] <ghostspartan80> man this game will just keep upping the anti especially towards the end
[4:29:12] <%CommanderSqueaks> Considering Woolie doesn't do FPS, I think he's doing fine, but this game is KRYPTONITE to Woolie's inherent desire to stop and think before acting.
[4:29:13] <+DesertPenguin> We done demon slaying
[4:29:14] <zocano> Nah I mean they could be done with Eternal for now I dunno
[4:29:14] <%OldManJEWc> So anyone that there Runeterra?
[4:29:16] <+DesertPenguin> ?
[4:29:22] <+agoaj> It's good that they leave room for Jesus during devil games.

[4:31:32] <mdkcde> bu then doom happened
[4:31:33] <%derap41> yar har
[4:31:33] <+VidulaSaix> Wait the demo is GONE?
[4:31:37] <+VidulaSaix> Why is it time limited
[4:31:38] <+dukenux> well that's too bad
[4:31:39] <+Taglog7> Bright Memory has a grapple hook
[4:31:41] <Bodregg> crab rave?
[4:31:42] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> why?
[4:31:45] <Mister_McDerp> time limited demos suck
[4:31:48] <%Javaa01> @WoolieVersus The Ghostrunner demo is only about 15 minutes long
[4:31:49] <+Aeoneth> switch to it now?
[4:31:52] <NiktenKing> Demo isn't long tho
[4:31:54] <CoffeeSlice> what the fuck
[4:31:55] <vVAstrAVv> look at it so i don't have to
[4:31:57] <Shardlab> Ooh, we playin' Devil Games again
[4:31:57] <%Irridium> the demo's like 15-20 minutes long so a quick switch would be fine
[4:31:59] <PleasantLeech> lame
[4:32:03] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Do it now then!
[4:32:11] <%RadicalWeegee> Dang that sucks
[4:32:17] <+agoaj> How big is the dev, maybe you can reach out, flex some influencer muscles
[4:32:19] <%0rond> you can 100% knock it out right now
[4:32:21] <%GeneralSCPatton> Only 15 minutes? Wow
[4:32:22] <%WanderingSwordsman> is it only on pc?
[4:32:24] <+Shubreaker> woolie sounds exhausted holy shit
[4:32:26] <%0rond> it's super short
[4:32:28] <mark_collins45> all that lore
[4:32:33] <PleasantLeech> !uptime
[4:32:33] <+DesertPenguin> hour long but yea
[4:32:33] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 4 hours and 40 minutes
[4:32:35] <%Javaa01> They're not 4 hours
[4:32:42] <+T_Rep> God damn it Pat
[4:32:43] <%Javaa01> But they can be an hour, easy
[4:32:46] <+VidulaSaix> You've honestly got a fair bit of this level left so yeah you're not close
[4:32:47] <+DesertPenguin> They're work-able chunks
[4:32:47] <Shishi1205> Some are chunky
[4:32:49] <+DesertPenguin> Two missions a stream
[4:32:53] <%Visorak6> 1-3 hours depending on how slow you are
[4:32:57] <+DesertPenguin> Two missions a stream, max
[4:32:58] <%GenesisKnight> You get fast travel at the end of each map
[4:33:00] <%RadicalWeegee> There an hour long But it feels like 5 great hours
[4:33:02] <Bodregg> you've still got like 25% of the level you're on
[4:33:04] <%LCLSmoothie> two hours each
[4:33:05] <%0rond> you shouldn't commit to more than two levels per chunk
[4:33:13] <randominternetsurfer> ok gn
[4:33:13] <+DesertPenguin> some are long due to lore reads
[4:33:18] <Viewtiful_Rose> 2 levels should be fine.
[4:33:37] <Mister_McDerp> yeah it was years
[4:33:37] <Viewtiful_Rose> One level per YouTube video would probably work too for the anime watchers
[4:33:38] <Shishi1205> 8 months till 251
[4:33:38] <+QuadraticGravity> ???
[4:33:39] <+VidulaSaix> ONE GUY
[4:33:43] <+Spatulord> That's BIG wrong
[4:33:43] <Josef_Stryker> ONE GUY
[4:33:47] <%Visorak6> one guy
[4:33:48] <%CommanderSqueaks> Who the fuck knows
[4:33:48] <+dukenux> OK ONE G"UY
[4:33:49] <%Javaa01> It was one guy who couldn't count
[4:33:49] <+Aeoneth> Dude is str8 wrong
[4:33:49] <awalr> armor is good. this post was made by the flame belch gang
[4:33:50] <%FuqBoiSlim> one guy
[4:33:50] <+DesertPenguin> WHere does it say that it's 8months?
[4:33:51] <Torgue_1> ONE GUY
[4:33:54] <Shishi1205> Which was the year Arc was Completed
[4:33:55] <cipher758> DOOMGUY vs ONEGUY
[4:33:56] <mywifeleftme_dot_mp4> Chat is usually wrong, Woolie
[4:33:59] <dekkitout> I mean, can S. Hayden build cool mechs in 8 months?
[4:34:00] <+QuadraticGravity> Even if it was true WHY would you donate that while he's on MISSION TWO
[4:34:04] <Shishi1205> Lore said 2051 for the aRc
[4:34:06] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> It was actually 1000000000000 years
[4:34:10] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh, he got affiliate? Hype
[4:34:13] <Shishi1205> Present timeline is not 2051
[4:34:22] <Tha_Mik> It was actually 5 seconds
[4:34:34] <mark_collins45> Woolie did you see the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and 2 Remaster trailer?
[4:34:36] <Who_lio42> colorblind ui options double as extra ui palettes
[4:34:40] <Shishi1205> Arc
[4:34:40] <%DianaTheAscian> i heard love live ive been summoned
[4:34:48] <bleugh> eternal is a prequel to 2016
[4:34:50] <Shishi1205> ARC completion was done i 2051
[4:34:55] <duskrush> who's excited for Tony Hawk?
[4:34:56] <%Nekros4442> WHAT IS UR FAV LOVE LIVE
[4:34:59] <user_naim> game takes place in 2060s, DOOM 2016 in the 2050s
[4:35:03] <%CommanderSqueaks> Always be pressing that button.
[4:35:10] <Man_in_the_Red> has Woolie ever seen Break Arts 2, its mecha racing but the real star is that mech creator
[4:35:21] <Aphex_0> Remember, THPS1 and 2 are both getting remasters
[4:35:22] <%QaizerArt> QaizerArt is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to WoolieVersus's community! They've gifted a total of 15 in the channel!
[4:35:23] <%QaizerArt> QaizerArt gifted a Tier 1 sub to Duke_of_HI!
[4:35:25] <%RioGascar> A problem i find with eternal is its juggling so many mechanics
[4:35:25] <%CommanderSqueaks> SwordTrickRoyalGunSword
[4:35:27] <%0rond> flame belch is a debuff you put on your enemy
[4:35:30] <Tha_Mik> It takes time
[4:35:31] <Bodregg> doom eternal takes place at the earliest in 2163, as there are codex entries that specifically refer to that year
[4:35:34] <%Zebroneath> Flame Belching a Glory Kill ready enemy is a nice combo
[4:35:37] <+agoaj> They weren't forward thinking enough to have people protesting the demon lockdown to reopen the Applebees.
[4:35:39] <DeathByPoke7> i like to combo flame belch with grenade
[4:35:41] <+QuadraticGravity> Flame Belch is not exclusive with Punch or Glory Kills. You combine them.
[4:35:46] <pixel_river> i never got used to blood punch
[4:35:55] <ghostspartan80> it takes time but when it sticks the game will be more manageable
[4:36:07] <+QuadraticGravity> oh. I feel called out I just wanted to dump points.
[4:36:08] <+Spatulord> There's a lot, but it's not too much too handle once you spend some time with it
[4:36:11] <user_naim> Eternal takes place in 2063 right?
[4:36:13] <+VidulaSaix> NALT
[4:36:17] <+arancet> theres a LOT of tools and you gotta use em all, so it does take time to get used to, dont worry, this is normal
[4:36:19] <user_naim> 2163*
[4:36:37] <dekkitout> Uh oh, will Dokapon have filler?
[4:36:39] <dosan121> Yes
[4:36:39] <DedlokPM> I just looked at Wikipedia. Doom 2016 takes place during 2162. So whoever is saying "ARC is 215x is mistaken
[4:36:40] <%CommanderSqueaks> Speaking of the anime, am I the only one who'd have no problem watching the anime if they also included the Face Cam? That's the main reason I watch VODs.
[4:36:47] <Tha_Mik> The animators need to step up their game
[4:36:52] <awalr> but when's the live action movie
[4:36:59] <+VidulaSaix> I'm bummed. I really liked watching the Kotor manga as well but the long break means the older vods are gone
[4:37:01] <+VidulaSaix> FeelsBadMan
[4:37:05] <Tuna_Can_0> end of an era PepeHands
[4:37:12] <%GeneralSCPatton> Last minute donation from me.
[4:37:12] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:37:22] <%CommanderSqueaks> @woolieversus Have you ever considered hosting a separate YouTube channel to upload the unedited streams so we can support you and get that awesome face cam experience?
[4:37:27] <%gunsrlove> CHURCH BELLS ? ON DOOM DAY ?
[4:37:32] <DedlokPM> So it is more likely the "8 months" thing especially since 2016 is in 2162 and Eternal is 2163
[4:37:32] <+Spatulord> I only just got on the Dokapon train
[4:37:33] <+toomuchsnarfsnarf> church bells?
[4:37:37] <%PunchLazers> punchlazers subscribed at Tier 1.
[4:37:40] <+VidulaSaix> Unless my twitch busted I couldnt find them
[4:37:42] <%GraceTBM> just lookin in the wrong place dog
[4:37:45] <%PunchLazers> Woolz! You're the meaning in my life... You're my inspiration! But seriously, I made a channel to be like you and my other internet dads! Thanks for everything!
[4:37:51] <+VidulaSaix> Ill give it another look though
[4:38:08] <%DianaTheAscian> y not both?
[4:38:14] <+VidulaSaix> Ill watch both bud dont worry LUL
[4:38:14] <+Taglog7> ANIMEEEEE
[4:38:17] <Shishi1205> Eight months after the events of 2016's DOOM, Earth has been overrun by demonic forces, wiping out 60% of the planet's population
[4:38:26] <%Reverend_Roscoe> SUPPORT THE MANGA
[4:38:27] <%CommanderSqueaks> Dokapon just ain't the same without watching your expressions.
[4:38:36] <%Visorak6> dong
[4:38:38] <dekkitout> So do the vods or the compilations work as ova's?
[4:38:38] <%jiggy_snipe> Support the Official Release
[4:38:44] <Aquinini> Woolie needs the views
[4:38:49] <%Reverend_Roscoe> SUPPORT THE ANIME
[4:38:58] <%Javaa01> Flame all the time
[4:38:59] <CrazyMedicine> Dokapon beach episode when?
[4:38:59] <%RioGascar> I check out the vods to see the twitch manga stuff like the pre anime stuff
[4:39:03] <+prime_name> Flame Belch things that die
[4:39:07] <%Irridium> yeah they stack. you get health and armor. same with the chainsaw
[4:39:08] <+QuadraticGravity> flame just means "When this thing dies, it explodes in armor"
[4:39:10] <%CommanderSqueaks> Like I'd be totally down if they just had a seperate YouTube channel they threw the stream footage onto, unedited.
[4:39:13] <Josef_Stryker> Always Flame Mooks ur about to Chainsaw
[4:39:13] <cipher758> Woolie Shippuden
[4:39:13] <%GeneralSCPatton> DYING ON FIRE = BIG ARMOR
[4:39:20] <%Javaa01> Killing a jobber that's on fire gives you over 20 armor
[4:39:21] <JetpackMcQuack> Guess what, they skip this part
[4:39:22] <%DianaTheAscian> are the twitch vods basically watching fan subs?
[4:39:23] <+Aeoneth> that's like 6 bits of advice conjumbled into 1
[4:39:24] <pillowwasp> Rippen tear
[4:39:27] <sendart> flames are not for damage
[4:39:30] <%RioGascar> Also cause im maybe a big egotistical and wanna hear my donations being read : l
[4:39:31] <%Javaa01> Yes
[4:39:31] <+QuadraticGravity> Yes, SHIT tons of armor
[4:39:32] <%Irridium> basically if you can flame belch anyone you're chainsawing/glory killing
[4:39:32] <Josef_Stryker> YES
[4:39:33] <Tuna_Can_0> yea
[4:39:33] <%DianaTheAscian> yes
[4:39:33] <+prime_name> Yes
[4:39:33] <Shishi1205> yes
[4:39:34] <%Javaa01> It's free health
[4:39:35] <%J0RD4NPR1M3> yes
[4:39:35] <+D00msDayDan> @WoolieVersus enemies explode into tons of armor if you kill them while they're on fire
[4:39:35] <ghostspartan80> yep
[4:39:36] <%CommanderSqueaks> Yes
[4:39:36] <+Shubreaker> YUP
[4:39:36] <+Aeoneth> YES
[4:39:36] <%Reverend_Roscoe> BELCH ENEMIES, THEN KILL THEM
[4:39:37] <%RadicalWeegee> yes
[4:39:38] <Picosunloaded> ye
[4:39:39] <Tuna_Can_0> they become armor pinatas
[4:39:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> FLAME EVERYTHING
[4:39:42] <dekkitout> Cook em up
[4:39:44] <%Irridium> YES. chainsaw too if you can
[4:39:45] <+Aeoneth> Small enemies are free health and Armor kits
[4:39:46] <%Javaa01> Armor is worth just as much as health
[4:39:46] <+D00msDayDan> @WoolieVersus also flame belch does literally no damage
[4:39:48] <%Irridium> armor+ammo
[4:39:49] <%Reverend_Roscoe> BELCH WEAK ENEMIES AND KILL THEM
[4:39:49] <awalr> better than letting the belch sit unused
[4:39:49] <vVAstrAVv> that micromissile tip is new to me too
[4:39:49] <PleasantLeech> yeah it recharges fast
[4:39:50] <%paladinstarbuster> USE IT OR LOSE IT
[4:39:50] <%WanderingSwordsman> the kill gives big armor drop
[4:39:56] <BafflerMeal> they drop more armor when they die, so glory kill + flame = health and armor
[4:39:57] <%Reverend_Roscoe> YES
[4:39:59] <%Mrthefro> use it on cooldown
[4:40:00] <%GeneralSCPatton> DYING ON FIRE = BIG ARMOR. SO COMBO IT WITH AN INSTANT KILL.
[4:40:00] <+Spatulord> NEVER EVER stop moving, mobility is your best friend
[4:40:01] <ghostspartan80> think of armor as extra health
[4:40:02] <%Javaa01> Groups are the most efficient
[4:40:02] <%DianaTheAscian> can u flame? yes? do flame
[4:40:04] <Shishi1205> Spam it
[4:40:05] <%RadicalWeegee> you get health AND Arrmor
[4:40:09] <%Javaa01> But you need to use it on cooldown
[4:40:10] <%GenesisKnight> Armor is always good
[4:40:14] <%Irridium> that is the ideal but you're not always in that position
[4:40:15] <voodoolawyer> I just tuned in and I can't believe Woolie looks this unhappy after playing DOOM
[4:40:19] <%CommanderSqueaks> It refills fast enough that you don't need to worry.
[4:40:21] <awalr> "what if i need it later"
[4:40:21] <+QuadraticGravity> You can get health AND armor, you don't have to wait to get to full health.
[4:40:23] <%Javaa01> Use your cooldowns
[4:40:23] <+Shubreaker> uh oh mind goblins activated
[4:40:25] <%Javaa01> Constantly
[4:40:26] <+xerotwo> It's pretty essential for the later parts
[4:40:26] <+prime_name> That's the ideal situation
[4:40:28] <+D00msDayDan> because flame belch does no damage you can play super lame and farm the last zombie in the arena for armor
[4:40:29] <bleugh> THREE GUYS
[4:40:31] <%Reverend_Roscoe> ABSF: ALWAYS BE SPITTIN FIRE
[4:40:32] <%Visorak6> Biggest tip of doom eternal that I relied on: always be moving, sort of plan routes as you move and make passes at enemies with dashes to evade
[4:40:32] <+Aeoneth> Mind Goblins are taking Woolie
[4:40:36] <Shishi1205> Get it on costant CD
[4:40:38] <%WanderingSwordsman> groups are an ideal situation
[4:40:42] <%CommanderSqueaks> Cooldowns refresh so quickly in this game that you can just use it for most things.
[4:40:44] <ghostspartan80> its a lot to take in for sure
[4:40:44] <Tuna_Can_0> I mean its ideal for groups but you'll benefit more from getting armor quickly
[4:40:46] <%Javaa01> Armor is worth just as much as health
[4:40:47] <voodoolawyer> The Mind Goblins live in the cube!
[4:40:48] <Tha_Mik> Use it when you're about to kill enemies
[4:40:48] <vVAstrAVv> its just letting you know its an aoe too
[4:40:53] <%DianaTheAscian> your gonna NEED to spam flames in later levels
[4:40:58] <Tuna_Can_0> armor pinatas PogChamp
[4:41:08] <%Zebroneath> Groups are ideal, but it's more harmful to wait in the long run.
[4:41:11] <%gratedjuice> The only time I use it is when I forget that R is not reload
[4:41:15] <+agoaj> Woolie played better than John Romero
[4:41:15] <brianthe12th> you could flame a heavy demon while fighting it for a steady stream of armor
[4:41:18] <%CommanderSqueaks> Quantity is more important than quality.
[4:41:19] <NotHereToStream> gg
[4:41:20] <%GenesisKnight> peace
[4:41:20] <+Spatulord> Always be running like you've just done a pound of coke

[4:43:29] <%Nekros4442> WHAT
[4:43:34] <+Shubreaker> no
[4:43:43] <Cherokia666> The collectables?
[4:43:44] <%GraceTBM> you'll keep your collectibles but not your location
[4:43:44] <Nested_Dreams> All upgrades and secrets are always saved
[4:43:47] <+aishman> You won't lose progress, you will lose the checkpoint.
[4:43:48] <+slimmixrp> i WOULD WAIT
[4:43:49] <PleasantLeech> you'll keep collectables
[4:43:53] <+slimmixrp> fINISH THIS MISSION FIRST
[4:43:55] <+JD_Lars> Keep stuff
[4:43:56] <mark_collins45> you lose the checkpoint
[4:43:58] <superinuit> you only have 1 previous mission so far
[4:44:03] <pillowwasp> Finish the mission first
[4:44:04] <KillMyPast> Secrets and upgrades are saved
[4:44:05] <%CommanderSqueaks> You lose checkpoint
[4:44:05] <%GraceTBM> you'll have to redo the whole mission
[4:44:07] <+aishman> @WoolieVersus The location will be gone, everything else keeps on going
[4:44:07] <+xerotwo> OOF
[4:44:07] <Wielderofthetriforce> keep collectibles, lose checkpoint
[4:44:09] <%GeneralSCPatton> You keep stuff but lose level progress.
[4:44:10] <HeroToxiko> Checkpoint gone stuff retained. do you boo
[4:44:10] <rubbishbinge> Checkpoint is eaten
[4:44:23] <Josef_Stryker> You can always use a separate file to practice maybe?
[4:44:23] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:44:31] <duskrush> You can practice in the murder basement at the next break
[4:44:33] <+Spatulord> You'll lose your checkpoint, but not your points and weapons
[4:44:35] <%Zebroneath> Collectables and upgrades are saved if you switch mid mission. Current checkpoint will be deleted, though.
[4:44:35] <+prime_name> Whahappun?
[4:44:35] <+InsaneJackLondon> time to keep streaming
[4:44:35] <superinuit> it's at least faster to go back and do old ones with cheats, with one collectible exception (slayer gates)
[4:44:39] <duskrush> or save your midpoints for the ship
[4:44:48] <%GeneralSCPatton> CATCH UP TO WHERE YOU WERE AT AS A PRE-STREAM WARM-UP
[4:44:49] <%jiggy_snipe> guess you gotta stream going back to old levels now
[4:44:51] <rubbishbinge> Play on another profile?
[4:44:52] <greengregguy> woolieMIRIN
[4:44:53] <%Solidnick18> That sucks anus
[4:44:56] <%That_Mojo> we can just watch you slowly get better if you can take the pressure
[4:44:56] <Tha_Mik> quite the pickle
[4:45:07] <%GraceTBM> you'lll be warmed up if you do that
[4:45:14] <Nested_Dreams> Or have a hard limit of 1 mission per stream
[4:45:14] <+JingKaisean> that sucks... I guess you're just gonna have to... RIP AND TEAR TO THE END
[4:45:15] <duskrush> @WoolieVersus set your breaks for when you're in the ship in between missions
[4:45:20] <%paladinstarbuster> speed through the levels for completion
[4:45:21] <%0rond> oh wait what
[4:45:22] <+kewlmyc> Don't stop in the middle of levels sadly
[4:45:25] <+Shubreaker> you heard it here folx doom eternal broke woolie on the second level
[4:45:25] <%0rond> wot happened
[4:45:26] <superinuit> this game also has more points than you'd need total, so 100% everything gives you extra if you get what i mean
[4:45:32] <vVAstrAVv> you dont wanna do that last fight again do you? lol
[4:45:41] <+xerotwo> doodSad
[4:45:51] <Th3rd3> no Doom Lab for Woolie BibleThump
