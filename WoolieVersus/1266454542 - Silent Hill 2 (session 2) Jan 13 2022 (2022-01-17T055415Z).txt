[0:00:58] <rabbitective> oh no woolie got the reptilian hell chip
[0:01:02] <%D4C_Trice> my 3rd booster kicked my ass
[0:01:19] <%D4C_Trice> got night shivers
[0:01:26] <Wakerpl> Is Silent Hill 2 connected to the first one at all?
[0:01:27] <%Th3SmartAlec> Aoko stans be happy today
[0:01:27] <%dds333a> @rabbitective the NwO has his mind now LUL
[0:01:30] <slackerunchained> @WoolieVersus The second shot often has more-profound effects than the first, due to the higher immune-response effect, Woolz.
[0:01:34] <leith_aziz> Finally back from vacation
[0:01:38] <+zanz_san> 3rd booster madee sleepy as hell
[0:01:45] <%cobalt_phoenix_> i feel like i lucked out, aside from my arm i only felt feverish for a few hours the day of and then nothing
[0:01:46] <iaraCatunda> kramer
[0:01:47] <+Bitscreed> All three of my shots knocked me on my arse.
[0:01:51] <rabbitective> @Wakerpl yes but you have to look for the connections
[0:01:51] <%dds333a> @wakerpl we'll get there
[0:02:00] <%Vextalyst> Vextalyst subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months! Yo Woolie. Watched Don't look up  and people who think Jonah Hill's character is unrealistic and cartoony are those lucky enough to not know that person. For me he is hauntingly realistic as I know 3 of him.
[0:02:07] <%Kriss1827> the booster gave me horrible headaches so much i didnt sleep for like 3 days
[0:02:13] <@Menitta> 8 and 9 are still quite good despite that I feel

[0:05:39] <%D4C_Trice> I experienced hole reaching with a blocked toilet. the gloves weren't long enough.
[0:05:39] <Nero270> The original toilet scene was going to be more graphic but that was scrapped after recording because of a technical difficulty onset so they just went with what we got in the game.

[0:06:10] <Ell1ot> sad, i missed it
[0:06:14] <slackerunchained> @thomasvalentine31 If you're talking about "Born from a Wish" it *Is* this version, but it's actually less-spoilery to play it after the main game
[0:06:16] <+theoldone001> Hopefully no one's a dumbass this time around and we can avoid emote only

[0:07:06] <leith_aziz> I think MB kinda proved to me that for how much people like to meme about the next "Strive killer" whenever ANY game comes out, if it doesnt have characters I find appealing, gameplay depth alone probably doesnt do it for me

[0:26:36] <%dds333a> @bitscreed that's because Harry needs nothing more
[0:26:36] <%Th3SmartAlec> @crudjandall I would agree with you, but even when emote only mode is on Woolie has several times been reading it to guage reactions. see end of last stream for example.

[1:06:20] <%MelBrooksKA> I thought they didn't read chat?
[1:06:21] <peachy996> I didn't know "shed your tears" was subtitled in the PC version. Is that by?
[1:06:21] <w_khan> no need to emote if he is just taking the answers on the journal and map now

[1:07:27] <Detrius25> Best version.
[1:07:33] <BR0Speedwagon> Woolie definitely has the memo
[1:07:44] <+maria_luke> It's DEFINITELY not the HD Collection version, that's for sure lol

[1:09:44] <%legacy0117> Lead not too healthy.
[1:09:45] <crudjandall> no saves deleted on death?
[1:09:46] <%nicversus> oh they got it lol

[1:10:25] <thomasvalentine31> If you use the ring, you respawn back at the Bonfile with non of your souls though.
[1:10:25] <+Firgof> I worry there was a version of SH2 where the escort quest was with bratchild.
[1:10:32] <%Th3SmartAlec> @okuriskyles Harry, Harry, and James walk into a bar...
[1:10:33] <DSD24> @okuriskyles Yeah but playing as Harry in Silent Hill 2 would be even worse
[1:10:33] <%lostcolors> kim has too much poise for silent hill's shit
[1:10:38] <majindusto> Woolie  with Reggie  as support definitely  playing this better than Max did lol
[1:10:44] <Aussie_Manny> *presses elevator button*
[1:10:50] <%MelBrooksKA> @okuriskyles I think that goes for almost anything
[1:10:50] <thomasvalentine31> @Firgof I wouldn't be surprised if the initial idea started out like that.
[1:10:55] <peachy996> Oh yeah Max spends ay too long at the apartments
[1:10:57] <brachydios777> I guess both rings are two ways to get poisoned
[1:10:59] <peachy996> It's pretty silly lol
[1:11:08] <%Th3SmartAlec> @majindusto no elevator crashes (yet) too
[1:11:11] <%nicversus> well you were JUST on the second floor and it wasn't there, and it's not on the first floor so...
[1:11:13] <%dds333a> @majindusto the R.E.G Sysyem is unmatched
[1:11:22] <w_khan> The place this takes on is now a rich small residential area. true horror
[1:11:23] <%holydeviant1> HDB would take one step into silent Hill, hear a distant rumble, and then leave.  "man, even this town doesn't want me."
[1:11:41] <majindusto> Woolie  CRUSHED  the Apartments with little  trouble  too
[1:11:41] <rabbitective> @majindusto nah dude you don't get it the game is so jank and the buttons don't work or whatever max said
[1:11:44] <%crybirb> @KuroYamigetsu Thanks for the gift sub!
[1:11:45] <%Th3SmartAlec> @holydeviant1 Shivers would be FUCKED
[1:11:46] <%holydeviant1> too spicy for silent hill

[1:11:58] <Detrius25> Seeing y'all enjoy this and the Halo series really gives hard nostalgia. This game was terrifying to me a a kid.

[1:12:21] <%dds333a> Silent Hill would go easy on Costeau LUL
[1:12:22] <peachy996> @rabbitective Key difference is Woolie and Reggie didn't get stuck on the coin puzzle and they found Angela quicker than MAx did

[1:16:31] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @dds333a he's never played before and only knows broad strokes through osmosis. I'd call that pretty blind.
[1:16:41] <%hereiam407> Only other semi normal person in town, probably want to save them

[1:22:00] <+Ether101_Prime> You went through the STORY DOOR. How wasn't it obvious?
[1:22:01] <eolen> it’s not that important
[1:22:02] <BlackLabud> Not a puzzle, though. It's a quiz..
[1:22:17] <%legacy0117> They could, but it was their choice to run than use the gun or knife. wooliePOYO
[1:22:26] <penitentpendant> @BlackLabud I mean, the 'hand door' was a 'puzzle' which usually means 'progress'
[1:22:36] <%dds333a> @blacklabud a quiz, a puzzle, a riddle
[1:22:39] <+Firgof> Not always though. Sometimes it's just items.
[1:22:39] <%dds333a> Kappa
[1:22:41] <Ziegsy> @Bitscreed Oh Shit, bits that you? Pixel burn?
[1:22:43] <+maria_luke> yeah, it was in the earlier years(?) of gaming, where level design didn't have indicators for points of no return iirc
[1:22:44] <UncleMcgoo> so not worth it
[1:22:49] <eolen> @penitentpendant but you couldn’t progress without doing it
[1:22:52] <%Hapsam> perfect time to get snacks
[1:22:57] <%Onorekian> Here's a riddle for ya: What's in my pocket?
[1:23:02] <ry4n_c00per> the door was opened ?
[1:23:03] <+maria_luke> or at least, it's not as common as now.
[1:23:04] <BlackLabud> @penitentpendant Oh, I see. You're right. I agree. Key items are always going to be progress instead od a quiz..
[1:23:05] <+Bitscreed> @ziegsy Yep it’s me. :)
[1:23:23] <%dds333a> @maria_luke by "earlier years", you mean decades after the first videogame but yeah LUL LUL LUL
[1:23:27] <Ziegsy> @Bitscreed Been a while! Im richards friend!
[1:23:33] <w_khan> same
[1:23:36] <BlackermanZX> i mean the puzzle is always progress
[1:23:42] <penitentpendant> @eolen Exactly, usually 'key item puzzles' means progress so they should be done 'last' for completion's sake

[1:23:58] <Skaab_Ruinator> well its safe to assume that if you are offered a puzzle, you cant do it anymore if you progress elsewhere
[1:24:03] <DrkJP520> well, you did use your key items, which are more likely to lead to points of no return

[1:27:26] <Josef_Stryker> Did Woolie roll back a save?
[1:27:31] <%hereiam407> We kind of get him later on
[1:27:32] <+Reverend_Roscoe> did they load a save?
[1:27:34] <w_khan> maybe a good idea to read the memos again
[1:27:37] <$RunningNGunning> @Josef_Stryker yes
[1:27:37] <+Firgof> lol I'm not sure I'd count that
[1:27:42] <brachydios777> We loaded a save?
[1:27:47] <BR0Speedwagon> One of those names was not a new name

[1:29:09] <ranarath> LUL
[1:29:09] <dukenux> they don't know the vital piece of SH4 lore Kappa
[1:29:09] <+Ether101_Prime> Are they place the fan port?
[1:29:13] <+TheMilkiestShake> Is that supposed to be an Ed Gein reference?
[1:29:17] <Ziegsy> hehehe
[1:29:20] <ranarath> Yah
[1:29:21] <Goo_Fed> scroll through all memo
[1:29:21] <rabbitective> @dds333a @cobalt_phoenix_ @Jiggisnipe Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[1:29:21] <Detrius25> Wish the rest of the SH had this abstract sort of horror. Like anything is possible in the Alt.
[1:29:23] <dukenux> yep
[1:29:24] <+SkitsofRandom> the answer is from a newspaper at the apartments
[1:29:26] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Pickle Sullivan, Scott Pickle, and Eric Stone
[1:29:26] <+Bitscreed> @themilkiestshake A blatant one at that
[1:29:29] <horriblegoatdemon> Check all memos, not just hospital ones
[1:29:31] <majindusto> Eric Gein is a reference  to a real killer named Ed Gein
[1:29:32] <Treasure_Vault> Save now?
[1:29:33] <%holydeviant1> @TheMilkiestShake Ed's an actual serial killer, IIRC
[1:29:38] <+adderbrew> @dukenux you've just reminded me how scary I thought SH4 was, that was the one that got to me
[1:29:38] <ry4n_c00per> just save ?
[1:29:44] <+SolGainer> just make a save before you answer 4head
[1:29:51] <w_khan> good idea
[1:29:55] <%ChoculaUltra> Eric Gein was Ed's less murdery brother Kappa
[1:29:56] <thomasvalentine31> @TheMilkiestShake Yeah and Texas chainsaw massacre was based on h im
[1:29:59] <Fuji808> wait you can save anywhere?
[1:29:59] <+Firgof> 3 and 4 had some strong moments but I felt 4 let me down a lot of the time
[1:30:00] <+TheMilkiestShake> @Bitscreed Yeah I thought so just didn't expect it tbf haha
[1:30:07] <dukenux> Did Ed Gein actually murder anyone? Or was he just a weirdo who dug up corpses and "played" with them
[1:30:17] <%Onorekian> oh yeah ed gein's the guy who skinned people and wore their skin 4Head
[1:30:18] <%dds333a> @fuji808 with this enhanced mod yeah
[1:30:24] <brunoberserk> is a EA LOOTBOX
[1:30:26] <%ChoculaUltra> he sure did make a lot of furniture out of human flesh, thats for sure
[1:30:28] <+Firgof> I loved the idea of 4 though
[1:30:29] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Oh eww thats gross
[1:30:43] <+Firgof> It's an idea that super needs to be revisited
[1:30:51] <+Bitscreed> Fun fact: Ed Gein was respected in his town for his babysitting skills.
[1:30:52] <%dds333a> @suckerpunchsyd he made a killer lampshade
[1:30:57] <thomasvalentine31> @Firgof Supposedly, 4 was going to be a Separate game alltogether called "The Room" but apparently Konami decided to slap Silent Hill on it to increase sales
[1:30:57] <+maria_luke> Red
[1:31:02] <+TheMilkiestShake> @dukenux Bit of both
[1:31:05] <dukenux> @Bitscreed see, wouldn't hurt a child
[1:31:06] <Pablox010> It was a newspaper
[1:31:09] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @dds333a eeeeeeeewww
[1:31:11] <+Firgof> @thomasvalentine31 That makes sense, yeah.
[1:31:24] <Detrius25> He had a couple special belts also. Think he was just hospitalized instead of imprisoned.
[1:31:39] <+Bitscreed> @dukenux Except that one kid he MIGHT have tried to strangle, but was never 100% prove
[1:31:41] <+maria_luke> newspaper "red devil:
[1:31:50] <penitentpendant> "Article about murder"
[1:31:51] <+maria_luke> "red devil"*
[1:31:55] <+Bitscreed> *proven
[1:31:56] <+Ether101_Prime> From what I understand Silent Hill 4 was going to be Silent Hill the Room not a completely new IP.

[1:55:42] <Make_me_mad> Silent Hill 1 still has, imo, the best otherworld city sections in the series. The entire street becoming a metal grate was terrifying.

[1:56:38] <+Firgof> @peachy996 The true horror is holding on to your resources so much that endgame you torture yourself by not using them
[1:56:50] <brunoberserk> city at night in SH2 is not scary as the SH1 city at night
[1:56:54] <%lostcolors> hate em
[1:56:54] <crudjandall> only game I can think of with relatively scarce ammo on normal difficulty is RE2 remake

[1:56:58] <%dds333a> Does that get you woolie?
[1:57:05] <morphinomarshal> Since the incident at the school there hasn't been much of a use for school busses

[2:17:19] <%hereiam407> Every SH2 play through should bring its own flavor
[2:17:31] <morphinomarshal> But a line  means locked, rather than broken
[2:17:34] <+Firgof> This SH2 playthrough, amazingly, has *fighting games* flavor.
[2:17:38] <+Firgof> Nobody foresaw this.
[2:17:48] <nailwind> the 9:1 PH matchup
[2:17:56] <%hereiam407> Pyramid Head tech is weak
[2:18:00] <%noxlunesia> noxlunesia subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! Woah, the manga is already on the James arc? We speed running this shit huh?
[2:18:03] <morphinomarshal> I think Woolie's going to LOVE SH3 for many, reasons. Not just the weapon selection
[2:18:03] <%dds333a> FBBlock
[2:18:05] <%molens1990> you ain't gonna role down Nathan Ave with a shotgun?
[2:18:05] <%itstreylar> pyramid head got that command grab tho

[2:18:31] <nailwind> PH has no neutral
[2:18:51] <morphinomarshal> @Firgof think we'll get SH4 and its crazy meter melee?
[2:18:57] <puluxor> this darkness looks so much nicer than the overblown fog effect sajamDegen

[2:19:17] <%itstreylar> pyramid heads neutral is staring at you menacingly
[2:19:20] <+Firgof> Also WHACK
[2:19:24] <%itstreylar> its a latent neutral
[2:19:32] <%legacy0117> Door opens in darkness. There ya go.
[2:19:33] <+horsesaredumb> @nailwind his full screen overhead makes up for it
[2:19:40] <nailwind> PH neutral is him hoping you run into him hard enough to kill yourself
[2:19:41] <rabbitective> @hassanico2 he has enough pistola ammo to deal with cabeza piramidal
[2:19:42] <%itstreylar> Did someone say the door to darkness?
[2:19:48] <%dds333a> @ether101_prime yep

[2:22:14] <hassanico2> Maybe it was programmed so James looks at the direction of that area to point you towards the First Aid kit?

[2:29:50] <+samuraiknack> Woolie craves big meat

[2:30:03] <%Theycallmenerf> Costco hotdogs?
[2:30:05] <+Stormiercashew> ok but is it a sandwich
[2:30:05] <+Firgof> Which is funny when you combine it with a hotdog bun. Because now you're stacking platforms just to put some ketchup in your mouth

[3:20:48] <stormhawk9891> @WoolieVersus He's becoming worse than Pat, Pat would at least shoot the gun
[3:20:54] <%jinking79> re2 gun or 2 knifes
[3:20:57] <Zap_Rowsdower32> The game gives more than enough ammo
[3:20:57] <%hereiam407> Yep
[3:21:03] <%FrostedZaibatsu> what
[3:21:04] <Ziegsy> you have to fire each empty gun once
[3:21:04] <%hereiam407> It just dies after a while
[3:21:04] <NireFuster> Yep
[3:21:08] <JacknZack27> I’m not mad. If you wanna use pipe use pipe. I just think you’ve got tons of ammo
[3:21:09] <Nabs96> @stormhawk9891 But Pyramidhead tho
[3:21:10] <%dds333a> not a bad ending, but it does die
[3:21:10] <Zap_Rowsdower32> No, you don't get the bad ening
[3:21:11] <+Firgof> 'You can't win, this fight is already over'
[3:21:13] <dukenux> I don't think you get a bad ening
[3:21:13] <Make_me_mad> You don't get a bad ending for that.
[3:21:14] <+eanscrale> Horror isn't nice
[3:21:15] <BlackermanZX> nah not a bad ending
[3:21:17] <bleugh> for pat it's about resources, for woolie it's about the honor of combat
[3:21:18] <rabbitective> i have to hoard these 700 bullets
[3:21:19] <dukenux> you just get an ending
[3:21:19] <hassanico2> Wait do y ou mean the Lizard or the god
[3:21:19] <%hereiam407> I ran out of ammo in that fight and it happened to me
[3:21:20] <%oneimportantthing> @nabs96 SH 1-4 are all great or decent, you can safely ignore the rest
[3:21:25] <NotHereToStream> henry wins by doing absolutely nothing
[3:21:27] <NireFuster> No bad ending, it just dies
[3:21:27] <@Squdnate> @Nabs96 SH1-3 are regarded as the holy trilogy. SH4 has it's fans and its haters. I would say 1-4 are good. Avoid Homecoming and Downpour
[3:21:28] <Grim1952> No it just dies and you get the ending you should
[3:21:29] <hassanico2> Activate brain power!
[3:21:30] <+Undenizen> One day, Pat and Woolie's venn diagram are gonna just be a circle and they'll have to juke it out in person UFC style.

Yeah, as much as I really enjoy the unique things that Ds2 does well, I just can't stand the fucking bland level design, and the NPCs (except for 1 or 2) really sucked in my opinion. At least Ds3, despite all of its flaws, was a Way better realised sequel than what initially got. DS1 is still the best though.

[3:38:13] <Fuji808> @tangowulf Yes. Eddie's out on his own now.
[3:38:13] <%patriotrenegade> DS2 had better weapon variety, armor sets (fashion souls) and backstab/riposte animations
[3:38:16] <rabbitective> the voice is saying "when's mahvel"
[3:38:19] <%Onorekian> weeeeeee
[3:38:22] <Nabs96> @oneimportantthing By a large margin. Only thing DS3 does better is combat but even that's at the cost of dumbing it down.
[3:38:23] <%MajorCrasher> I started DS2 for the first time recently and I think I'm about halfway done.  So far I like it way better than the first game
[3:38:29] <Grim1952> It's lucy lawless

[3:38:44] <%slimmixrp> Real strong
[3:38:51] <%oneimportantthing> @nabs96 DS3 really felt like it was scared of not giving enough DS1 fanservice
[3:38:53] <crudjandall> DS2 is my personal favourite, but I think DS1 is better in certain ways
[3:38:53] <%patriotrenegade> DOWN LOW??
[3:38:54] <Grim1952> It's stray demon
[3:38:55] <dukenux> go away, baitin

[3:39:23] <helpusgod> nope it says "you should go"
[3:39:25] <Nabs96> @majorcrasher It's definitely my fave of the three games. It doesn't shit the bed as badly as 1 in its second half and it's waaaay more unique and interesting than Dark Souls "I'm a remake of the first game" 3
[3:39:27] <crudjandall> similar to SH2 is the better game, but SH4 is my favourite
[3:39:29] <+toomuchsnarf> it's saying when's mahvel
[3:39:31] <NireFuster> Oh???
[3:39:32] <thomasvalentine31> @patriotrenegade Cloud: ?

[3:55:48] <%oneimportantthing> Man that scream
[3:55:48] <linSP> very cool
[3:55:50] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> it's probably just for autoerotic asphyxiation
[3:55:52] <+ReallyBigRocks> you only need the drop if you want it to be quick and painless
[3:55:52] <+projectmanatees> There’s a cut out in the stand
[3:55:55] <+SolGainer> This puzzle is so funny
[3:55:59] <rabbitective> CBT ROOM
[3:56:02] <marshalmorphino22> This space is evil

[3:56:08] <LunarRemix> Those tablets look so silly
[3:56:08] <%hereiam407> Evil Room
[3:56:08] <+applegreen92> Ok so, fun fact. There's not a single ledge you can fall off like that and be stunned for a bit. This is deliberate.
[3:56:11] <w_khan> oh

[3:58:25] <Estuko> LUL
[3:58:26] <mortificent> Kappa

[4:21:32] <%Deekman> I thought he was only ever referred to as Red Pyramid Thing but I guess they do actually call him Pyramid Head in game. Weird.
[4:21:32] <$hattrick61> I like how its five feet long but its still a "knife"
[4:21:33] <DSD24> Actually can't see shit
[4:21:34] <marshalmorphino22> James has to kill fast! And bullets too slow!

[4:22:15] <%JetpackMcQuack> READY-
[4:22:15] <DrkJP520> maybe you should've saved first
[4:22:16] <rabbitective> he dipped LUL
[4:22:17] <drunken_lemur> @hattrick61 There is Historical Precedent for that! It used to be illegal to have a sword in Germany, I think. But you could have a "Knife" as big as you wanted.
[4:22:20] <dukenux> @hassanico2 yes
[4:22:22] <marshalmorphino22> I sure hope Pyramid head isn’t angry that James stole his great knife
[4:22:23] <Enn19> @hassanico2 Yeh
[4:22:25] <+Santamooo> I would love to watch Harry do a True Charged Slash on P-Head
[4:22:26] <vuetyris> it is in sh3 yes
[4:22:26] <+maria_luke> y'know what'd be neat? if the knife made screeching sounds against the grating
[4:22:28] <%dds333a> he wanted the one v one LUL
[4:22:28] <Grim1952> I imagine pyramid head walking in the same direction
[4:22:30] <Treasure_Vault> he's probably exactly around the circle
[4:22:30] <marshalmorphino22> I sure hope this won’t have consequences
[4:22:31] <+Ozzync> james doesnt have de str requirement to hold the sword
[4:22:32] <thomasvalentine31> Make sure you sword uppercut so that way James can take out Ebony and Ivory to gun juggle
[4:22:33] <Treasure_Vault> same speed
[4:22:33] <%SuckerPunchSyd> What a coward
[4:22:35] <%SouLucha> There can be ONLY ONE

[6:02:47] <Melchior_the_Wise> @NireFuster that's a bit longer than average. but streamer tax
[6:02:49] <+SolGainer> Probably a couple hours minimum
[6:02:55] <+1upclock> Waiting for you...

[6:03:17] <RickyRelucent> digivolution wasnt perfect, sone gymnastics were applied
[6:03:17] <%livlinn> HypeYum
[6:03:18] <+typingsarcasm> gotta love these horror tropes
[6:03:19] <Nabs96> Cos if they do one more session it might be too short lol
[6:03:20] <peachy996> are you, I can't find you
[6:03:20] <%CappuccinoGuil> @thomasvalentine31 what's the square footage and when can I see the place?
[6:03:23] <NireFuster> @Melchior_the_Wise Yeah there's still a couple hours left though, but from the looks of it it seems to be around the same length as the first one, if not a little bit longer
[6:03:27] <+typingsarcasm> gee, I hope there are no traps in that room
[6:03:28] <mass1997> Oh wow we're still going?
[6:03:30] <+wmeldrum> either my wife of mistress is in there... don't remember which...
[6:03:31] <+ReallyBigRocks> it couldn't possibly be some weird fucked up bullshit, definitely my wife
[6:03:36] <RickyRelucent> stopped after the one, heard the later ones werent buns
[6:03:37] <Ieatzombees> Lakeview is just Con crud
[6:03:38] <+Ozzync> are they going for full playtrhough in this stream?
[6:03:39] <+healnavi> damn, they got far today
[6:03:40] <Awesome_Leaf> @SrHassan ah thanks. guess i just caught the last sitting alone lol
[6:03:46] <+typingsarcasm> my wife!!
[6:03:48] <mortificent> The sneaking map
[6:03:49] <Melchior_the_Wise> @Ozzync define full
[6:03:55] <%CappuccinoGuil> @wmeldrum and it's my mistress that looks just like my wife, so I can't do process of elimination ehre
[6:03:56] <Nabs96> hey wait what about Maria. did he just leave her in the prison cell lol
[6:03:58] <hassanico2> Anyone think he's gonna deathstream this game to the end or...?
[6:04:03] <%oneimportantthing> I can't imagine they can go all the way till the end, it'a still a few hours left
[6:04:07] <ChronoRomancer> @Nabs96 they found her dead
[6:04:08] <thomasvalentine31> @RickyRelucent 1, 2, and 3 are awesome. 4 is an acquired taste. Millage may vary on the rest
[6:04:09] <RickyRelucent> latest ones werent galf vad neither
[6:04:13] <+SolGainer> @Nabs96 he went back to get her and she was dead again somehow
[6:04:14] <+Ozzync> final area
[6:04:16] <peachy996> not even a few hours
[6:04:20] <dukenux> They're in the final area now
[6:04:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> *ding*
[6:04:22] <Awesome_Leaf> ring it anyway
[6:04:23] <+typingsarcasm> Mr Sutherland, you left your sex tape here
[6:04:29] <Nabs96> @chronoromancer I thought that was a different one from the one jn the jail cell. that's kinda anticlimactic
[6:04:32] <+typingsarcasm> please dispose of it
[6:04:35] <SpartanSeventyEight> Why are we not talking about the best Silent Hill game: Homecoming?
[6:04:36] <Chester_goes_Berserk> ending is probs 2-3 hours away
[6:04:37] <peachy996> They could do it now but it's getting late and I think Canada has a curfe again no?
[6:04:41] <thomasvalentine31> James: Gee thnx silent hill  silent hill: don't mention it buddy
[6:04:46] <Ieatzombees> Be careful Reggie
[6:04:48] <TheProtomanBlues> How long till the end
[6:04:54] <%oneimportantthing> You zoomers never enjoyed the bliss of VHS and cassette tapes
[6:04:56] <RickyRelucent> i still gave component cables just so ny pre ps2 era stuff looks kinda good
[6:04:57] <+Ozzync> curfew? bruh
[6:04:57] <+ReallyBigRocks> @typingsarcasm we watched it in the employee lounge and tbh it wasn't very good
[6:04:57] <slackerunchained> "Might as well help myself to the bar, since there's no bartender..."
[6:05:01] <Nabs96> @theprotomanblues feels like they'll be able to finish it today
[6:05:02] <marshalmorphino22> Another 2 hours or more
[6:05:02] <Melchior_the_Wise> @SpartanSeventyEight because it doesn't need to be mentioned
[6:05:12] <+CptBritches> Bust a mad save
[6:05:12] <RickyRelucent> doubt tvs will jeep xoming with plugins
[6:05:17] <Ieatzombees> Reggie save
[6:05:20] <peachy996> there you go
[6:05:21] <brachydios777> I'm 22 and I remember vhs
[6:05:23] <TalisKanju> @TheProtomanBlues Shorter than you think, longer than you hope.
[6:05:37] <dukenux> yea not a fan of cucumber water
[6:05:37] <OblivionSword1> goos time to end it today
[6:05:38] <Awesome_Leaf> cucumber water SeemsGood
[6:05:39] <+kewlmyc> Fucking gross. Just give me regular water
[6:05:44] <marshalmorphino22> Maybe skim some stones at the lake
[6:05:44] <%cobalt_phoenix_> yo cucumber-lemon-ginger-mint water is the best tho
[6:05:45] <majindusto> I'm looking  forward  to Woolie  getting  around to Silent Hill 3 and Hopefully 4...Because  Pat was a Coward  and didn't  play it
[6:05:45] <Ieatzombees> Those are gross and necessary
[6:05:47] <Nabs96> @oneimportantthing I did. And by bliss do u mean annoyingly having to fix that stupid film every time it got loose lol
[6:05:48] <mortificent> time to end stream?
[6:05:49] <Dr_Mooose> understandable Reggie
[6:05:50] <%jinking79> LUL
[6:05:51] <TheProtomanBlues> @Nabs96 Even with curfew times?
[6:05:52] <Fear_Ranjer> Cucumber OR lime water is nice for me
[6:05:54] <+ReallyBigRocks> when life gives you lemons
[6:05:55] <SpartanSeventyEight> @Melchior_the_Wise I'm actually happy I only got 1 reply, means the majority recognise ignoring it is the best course of action.
[6:05:55] <marshalmorphino22> Maybe admire the bird fountain
[6:05:57] <Awesome_Leaf> <3
[6:06:00] <TheProtomanBlues> Oh well
[6:06:01] <+Nekros4442> the f
[6:06:01] <%oneimportantthing> @nabs96 exactly lmao
[6:06:02] <Melchior_the_Wise> I'm dissapoined woolz missed that piece of dialogue where its revealed james is a raging alcoholic.
[6:06:03] <dukenux> what a cliffhanger
[6:06:03] <NotHereToStream> good sesh, one more to go
[6:06:04] <NireFuster> End of stream? Damn, okay then!

[6:06:15] <Melchior_the_Wise> this is a good place to end
[6:06:16] <%livlinn> GGs shiaHypers
[6:06:16] <Nabs96> @theprotomanblues I wasn't considering that. I have no idea
[6:06:16] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> those lemons need using up
[6:06:16] <BlackermanZX> good session
[6:06:18] <NireFuster> It's a good place to end yep
[6:06:20] <thomasvalentine31> @majindusto I believe at this rate, Silent Hill 3 pc version is probably the best version since the HD collection is a butchered mess
[6:06:21] <mortificent> yeyeye good break point
[6:06:23] <nailwind> so happy about this LP
[6:06:24] <+pectusumbra> Next stream should be the end for sure
[6:06:24] <Blank9> doing good
[6:06:25] <Fear_Ranjer> Damn, nearly 6 and a half hours!
[6:06:25] <+typingsarcasm> can't help but wonder how James' sextape fits into the plot
[6:06:26] <%cobalt_phoenix_> V E R Y G O O D

[6:07:16] <NireFuster> :)
[6:07:16] <%Th3SmartAlec> Pizza time
[6:07:23] <linSP> :(
[6:07:23] <marshalmorphino22> Enjoying might not be the right word
[6:07:26] <nailwind> Maria EX
[6:07:27] <Melchior_the_Wise> are you in your own head?
[6:07:28] <%Theycallmenerf> QA fights
[6:07:32] <RickyRelucent> p r o g r e s s i o n
[6:07:36] <+typingsarcasm> plot twist: James died on that boat
[6:07:36] <Ieatzombees> Nice stream Reggie and Woolz
[6:07:36] <marshalmorphino22> The game really goes to mess with you
[6:07:37] <AngryAsian5> There was a hole here....
[6:07:40] <GHouseduivel> We "solved" a puzzle
[6:07:41] <@Solidus_113> absolute QA
[6:07:42] <NotHereToStream> pyramid head corridor was great
[6:07:43] <slackerunchained> "Let's Partyyyyyyy~!" - President Dombrowski.
[6:07:45] <GHouseduivel> LUL
[6:07:50] <Electro96> the historical society is one of the coolest places in a game
[6:07:52] <NireFuster> "Show me a good time, James!"
[6:07:52] <thomasvalentine31> @AngryAsian5 But it's gone now
[6:07:57] <+0neReeler> woolie will figure it out
[6:08:07] <LittleSiberianBear> @WoolieVersus we are too babied.
[6:08:16] <NireFuster> Yep
[6:08:23] <Melchior_the_Wise> I feel like Half-life did it best
[6:08:24] <thomasvalentine31> I blame the impact of "games as story" for having a part in that
[6:08:25] <+0neReeler> why souls caught on
[6:08:27] <NireFuster> Yep, yep
[6:08:27] <+typingsarcasm> was Myst the peak of "figure it the fuck out" ??
[6:08:28] <%Theycallmenerf> Sometimes figuring it out is necessary
[6:08:30] <@Solidus_113> it's part of the reason Dark Souls blew up so hard
[6:08:31] <%Th3SmartAlec> Or figure it out when only reading half the instructions Kappa
[6:08:37] <marshalmorphino22> James is also not normal
[6:08:38] <Ieatzombees> That's just Silent Hill though
[6:08:40] <LittleSiberianBear> don't insult your audiences' intellect
[6:08:44] <%MajorCrasher> like dark souls?
[6:08:44] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[6:08:47] <LittleSiberianBear> bread crumbs.
[6:08:49] <NireFuster> Figure it the fuck out works when you actually have SOME information to go off of
[6:08:52] <%Th3SmartAlec> @marshalmorphino22 he;s a genetic freak
[6:08:54] <@Solidus_113> you look at Dark Souls 1 and Skyrim coming out the same year
[6:08:56] <%mcginnis90> mcginnis90 subscribed at Tier 1. 
[6:08:59] <Basic_Birch_> Outer Wilds feels like that
[6:09:03] <linSP> melt the wax woolie, make the handle
[6:09:05] <%mcginnis90> Thanks for play SH2, Woolie and co! You guys are alright.
[6:09:07] <LittleSiberianBear> @WoolieVersus or hey, that hangman game? there was no wrong solution. you would kill errebody
[6:09:07] <iswearimjustdandy> Touch detective  1 1/2 is the worst with this
[6:09:13] <marshalmorphino22> @th3smartalec is it going to be a 3 way at sacrifice with Eddie and pyramid head?
[6:09:15] <%Theycallmenerf> Will streams ever do the 1st try bets like Reggie had for bosses in DS but for Woolie in SH?
[6:09:16] <+typingsarcasm> or is Frog Fractions the peak of Figure it the Fuck Out ??
[6:09:22] <NireFuster> DS1 has a lot of ''figure it the fuck out'' parts where it's near impossible to do it on your own
[6:09:24] <Melchior_the_Wise> a lot of the puzzles are kind of esoteric tbh
[6:09:31] <%Th3SmartAlec> @marshalmorphino22 Eddie KNOWS he can't beat James LUL

[6:09:46] <Nabs96> @solidus_113 I get you but honestly skyrim does a p good job of pointing you where you need to go even without markers
[6:09:46] <%dds333a> @nirefuster you say that, but LUL
[6:09:53] <+SolGainer> @Theycallmenerf all Silent Hill Bosses are relatively easy, since the game isn't really about the combat
[6:10:01] <RickyRelucent> lots of ppl can just not be that subtle
[6:10:01] <slackerunchained> I still can't fuckin' believe that friggin' 'Grenadier' reference Woolie was able to pull, there. :D
[6:10:04] <LittleSiberianBear> @WoolieVersus there was supposed to be a light. a light house or some shit. i dont' know why it didn't look more ... pronounced.
[6:10:20] <marshalmorphino22> The rowing looks way worse in the he version
[6:10:25] <GHouseduivel> Also being Silent Hill, the game could be fucking with you, and the light is a red hearing
[6:10:25] <Ieatzombees> Aging silent hill 2. Part of the process

[6:10:47] <LittleSiberianBear> @WoolieVersus a great game that doesnt' give you any hints but is in tuitive is OUTER WILDS. not outer worlds. outer WILDS is good
[6:10:47] <RickyRelucent> or however thats said
[6:10:50] <iswearimjustdandy> You werent wandering too long though, it feels longer with an audience i think
[6:10:50] <peachy996> Strong Wax
[6:11:00] <majindusto> Logic...In Silent Hill? lol
[6:11:03] <marshalmorphino22> The great knife not being able to cut the wires is a bit of a stretch
[6:11:04] <Blank9> rubber chicken + pulley
[6:11:09] <iswearimjustdandy> @littlesiberianbear i was gonna fucking say that OW rules
[6:11:10] <LittleSiberianBear> @WoolieVersus oh yeah. there have been obtuse point and clicks.
[6:11:16] <marshalmorphino22> I like melting the candle
[6:11:19] <mortificent> yeyeyeye I love Monkey Island
[6:11:21] <LittleSiberianBear> @iswearimjustdandy say it louder for the streamers to hear
[6:11:26] <%mcginnis90> Hey Woolie and guy I've never seen until now! I love Silent Hill, thanks for playing
[6:11:27] <Ieatzombees> You're doing great. Don't  think too much on it
[6:11:29] <%jinking79> Fear Effect Use the bath towel
[6:11:32] <nailwind> imagine silent hill with outer wilds quantum fuckery
[6:11:41] <+0neReeler> pre gamefaqs
[6:11:44] <Melchior_the_Wise> Zero punctuation mentions that kind of logic in his review of SH2
[6:11:48] <LittleSiberianBear> @nailwind it woudlnt' be either game but... fuckin lord.
[6:11:51] <%dds333a> It's not too crazy, but MGS, use the ketchup is great
[6:11:52] <marshalmorphino22> Forbidden Siren has some horrendously difficult puzzles
[6:11:55] <%Theycallmenerf> @nailwind That would be SICK
[6:11:56] <Nabs96> @woolieversus Hey Woolz since there doesn't seem to be too much of the game left now, what's you do if next session ends up being super short?
[6:12:05] <Blank9> having friends ask for hints gets rough because man they lose interest quick if they have to ask anything
[6:12:07] <RickyRelucent> brute force only cald first try
[6:12:07] <Ieatzombees> True
[6:12:09] <%G_Thunders> Accessing the DS1 DLC took what like 18-24 hours to discover even with the entirety of DS1 fans who owned it posting on the internet about it
[6:12:10] <NireFuster> Yeah, definitely
[6:12:11] <Blank9> like rip getting people into monster hunter
[6:12:13] <NireFuster> 100% agree
[6:12:14] <RickyRelucent> valid*
[6:12:18] <%livlinn> I have to rewatch ZP review for this
[6:12:20] <+solzan2000> yup
[6:12:29] <lostallmyaccs> It was fun back in the day when your whole school is trying to find the solution and the one who finds it becomes the cool kid for a week LUL
[6:12:30] <GHouseduivel> Microsoft: No :)
[6:12:37] <peachy996> Thanks Reggie
[6:12:38] <Nabs96> I agree

[6:13:25] <+Breaknoon> SH3 is like 6 hours tops
[6:13:29] <marshalmorphino22> 4 is a strange game

[6:13:47] <Blank9> I want to see elden ring on ps4 have bloodborne's memory leak AI problems
[6:13:49] <marshalmorphino22> Pat was always too much of a coward to play SH4
[6:13:55] <Blank9> just some real colossal nonsense going on
[6:13:55] <%Th3SmartAlec> You need more red circles and fake titles
[6:13:57] <+nanaki_ff14> Hope Reggie does DS2 and 3eventually
[6:14:00] <Nabs96> Me liking dark souls AND silent hill: I'll have what I'm having!
[6:14:05] <thomasvalentine31> 1-4, homecoming. although Origins is fun too
[6:14:12] <thomasvalentine31> those would be my six in regard to silent hill
[6:14:17] <Nabs96> @nanaki_ff14 I really hope they don't skip DS2. That'd make me sad
[6:14:21] <%Theycallmenerf> According to my friend, where I described my living situation rn I am practically in Silent Hill 4
[6:14:24] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> shadow man 😇

[6:15:12] <%Th3SmartAlec> Post-Stream Labbing PogChamp

[6:15:30] <Slim_Lipid> my cousin would always beat me at Need for Speed because of those fucking analog face buttons
[6:15:32] <OblivionSword1> it is a pc port of a ps2 game
[6:15:37] <GHouseduivel> Is there an option in the bindings?
[6:15:38] <Ieatzombees> Not on PC
[6:15:42] <Nabs96> Oh I don't remember that at all. but I was just a kid when I had a ps2 so I didn't even comprehend the complexities of stuff like that
[6:15:43] <DrkJP520> I thought I remembered that being a thing in this game
[6:15:46] <RickyRelucent> itcan work, gotta use every button and have alot of contextual ity

[6:18:24] <%MajorCrasher> 17 and looks 30 LUL
[6:18:24] <marshalmorphino22> I love that we can see the screen reflected behind Reggie
[6:18:28] <SyLuX45> The Name of the Monster gives it away
[6:18:30] <slackerunchained> Angela seriously does Not LOOK 17.
[6:18:31] <RickyRelucent> its nultiple thats and uts skin stretched over a frame with sime han solos
[6:18:34] <%livlinn> woolieLORE labbing
[6:18:39] <mortificent> yeah, Angela is in her late teens
[6:18:39] <dukenux> she's younger than she looks(and sounds)
[6:18:41] <iaraCatunda> it's a word play I think like abstract cause it like a painting frame but also looks like a bed frame
[6:18:41] <Melchior_the_Wise> @MajorCrasher stress
[6:18:43] <GHouseduivel> @slackerunchained Abuse can age you very hard
[6:18:46] <+Krasmeyts> She's a 17 year old in a 30 year old's body.
[6:18:47] <GHouseduivel> Crime of passion
[6:18:49] <iaraCatunda> same last name i guess
[6:18:50] <Chatterbox1991> Angela was modeled after Sandra Bullock in The Net
[6:18:53] <peachy996> no worries
[6:18:53] <+BelricPsytar> woolie just making shit up
[6:18:54] <dukenux> cause "crime of passion" usually implies marital shit?
[6:18:59] <GilliamYaeger> Definitely the age. She looks way older than she actually is
[6:18:59] <marshalmorphino22> Angels does look old
[6:19:01] <majindusto> Angela doesn't  look it...But she is 17
[6:19:03] <+Breaknoon> she's 17 but more like a fucked up 30 year old
[6:19:05] <SixthShinx> The wiki says Angela is 19
[6:19:07] <marshalmorphino22> Older than she’s supposed to be
[6:19:12] <+nanaki_ff14> Angela the reverse Tiki from Fire Emblem..
[6:19:14] <Ieatzombees> Just happenstance
[6:19:15] <jett_eyes> maybe because the monster was present you assumed the one that was already dead was somebody else
[6:19:16] <MrMatternot> Angela is a teenager
[6:19:16] <drunken_lemur> It's Silent Hill fuckery
[6:19:17] <umbraawitch> she looks 40
[6:19:21] <burstaxe> Angela just looks way older
[6:19:28] <OblivionSword1> Angela is way younger than you think Woolie
[6:19:28] <NireFuster> Well yeah she's supposed to look older
[6:19:29] <JacknZack27> She’s totally still a teenager
[6:19:29] <%mcginnis90> @dukenux More like you killed someone, anyone, because you were really mad like dude's fighting each other bare knuckled
[6:19:33] <majindusto> NOPE
[6:19:33] <%ChoculaUltra> LUL
[6:19:35] <dukenux> Angela is the tv series high schooler
[6:19:35] <%dds333a> it wasn't just her dad either
[6:19:36] <GHouseduivel> Yeah she is looking rough
[6:19:37] <SyLuX45> Abstract Daddy is the monsters name bow
[6:19:38] <Melchior_the_Wise> james is probably early 30s
[6:19:41] <RickyRelucent> killed pappy afrer sexual abuse
[6:19:43] <%livlinn> HD version gave her more high pitched va but it sounds weird to me
[6:19:43] <MrMatternot> "My Momma"
[6:19:45] <LittleSiberianBear> @SixthShinx in silent hill books and notes. it's 17 16
[6:19:45] <+SolGainer> You can talk about it with more context once you finish the game
[6:19:46] <%CappuccinoGuil> She's 17, but she looks old because she was "forced to grow up" Woolie
[6:19:49] <RickyRelucent> wideoeeposad
[6:19:49] <%Javaa01> Yeah don't assume a linear timeline in the case of Silent Hill games
[6:19:50] <%jinking79> Can't wait for the Podcast LUL
[6:19:51] <iaraCatunda> she dresses old out of trauma I think
[6:19:51] <BlackermanZX> shes a teenager LUL just a fucked old ps2 modl
[6:19:53] <+HelveticaScenario> She looks old but is in her teens
[6:19:56] <Ieatzombees> She does not look 17 no shot
[6:19:58] <jett_eyes> but she still has the blood covered knife?
[6:19:58] <NireFuster> She's got the behavior of a kid but she looks adult, she's 19
[6:20:01] <Chatterbox1991> she's not in her 30s Woolie
[6:20:04] <majindusto> Her Trauma aged her bad
[6:20:05] <%noxlunesia> She's 19, she LOOKS 30. Think back to Pat, he hinted that she had been through "some shit"
[6:20:07] <+Breaknoon> yeah
[6:20:11] <LittleSiberianBear> trauma and can age people.
[6:20:12] <%CappuccinoGuil> she looks older because she "grew up" Woolie
[6:20:15] <%dds333a> There is more to her by the way
[6:20:16] <rabbitective> angela is 19 during the game
[6:20:16] <MrLastChanceLearns> HARD LIVING
[6:20:17] <+Breaknoon> she's seen some shit
[6:20:19] <marrowjuice> trauma can age people
[6:20:22] <DXLelouch24> @WoolieVersus wiki says shes 19 ignore chat
[6:20:22] <MrMatternot> She is aged through trauma
[6:20:23] <dukenux> same
[6:20:25] <%ChoculaUltra> Angela lived a hard life FeelsBadMan
[6:20:26] <%Prevot> PS2 teenagers
[6:20:28] <ospreyworks> Does the game actually state her age somewhere? In game?
[6:20:29] <%noxlunesia> Remember Pat's words. She's grown up fast because she's "been through some shit"
[6:20:29] <Ieatzombees> Good job Konami
[6:20:32] <Melchior_the_Wise> alessa was like 14
[6:20:33] <GHouseduivel> Is it just me, or have people aged better in the current times, vs. the old days?
[6:20:35] <NireFuster> Yes but trauma fucked her up that's why she looks like that
[6:20:38] <Chatterbox1991> @WoolieVersus she's supposed to resemble Sandra Bullock, which might explain why she looks older
[6:20:39] <marshalmorphino22> Angels had a depressing life and it messed her up
[6:20:42] <+Ether101_Prime> Silent Hill fucks with everything including appearances.
[6:20:46] <LittleSiberianBear> @WoolieVersus true but they kept the weirdness because... reason it's supposed to be ambiguous
[6:20:49] <DXLelouch24> wiki says shes 19
[6:20:50] <Chatterbox1991> (i got that from Matt ftr)
[6:20:52] <NireFuster> But admitedly Angela is almost 20, she's 19
[6:20:53] <DXLelouch24> ignore chat
[6:20:53] <%dds333a> Just keep playing. there is more to see
[6:20:54] <+Breaknoon> lotta trauma
[6:20:57] <umbraawitch> how far are we in sh2?
[6:20:57] <+healnavi> whole chat trying to give the correct interpretation:U
[6:20:57] <rabbitective> i looked 30 when i was 21 because i was sleeping 1 hour a day
[6:21:03] <Ieatzombees> Konami taking the L again
[6:21:07] <+Breaknoon> no
[6:21:08] <%Gasgrave> She's modeled older and sounds older on purpose. It's about how the stress aged her so much.
[6:21:08] <LittleSiberianBear> @WoolieVersus look in the book.
[6:21:08] <Nabs96> I'll be real Idc
[6:21:08] <%mcginnis90> @noxlunesia That's where the whole, "girls grow up faster than boys" thing comes from; girls having to deal with men/boys
[6:21:08] <+BelricPsytar> no...

[6:21:16] <%Th3SmartAlec> Ask Pat
[6:21:17] <slackerunchained> @umbraawitch Hotel
[6:21:17] <peachy996> Well junkies can look 20 years older, not saying Angela is one but there is an irl example of this
[6:21:18] <%dds333a> maybe Kappa
[6:21:19] <dukenux> You can never be sure :)
[6:21:19] <+BelricPsytar> no were not...
[6:21:19] <NireFuster> DON'T DO THAT
[6:21:20] <LittleSiberianBear> @WoolieVersus that or james is that kind of sick
[6:21:21] <artoflec> shes supposed to be 19 yeah, but who knows, time is convoluted in silent hill
[6:21:23] <mortificent> Yeah, not now
[6:21:23] <UncleMcgoo> She was very intentionally designed

[6:21:36] <NireFuster> Don't even GOOGLE any characters yet
[6:21:36] <drunken_lemur> Just ask Pat, I'm sure he'll give you a straightforward answer
[6:21:37] <iaraCatunda> that's fair
[6:21:38] <umbraawitch> @slackerunchained shit we're almost done
[6:21:39] <JacknZack27> Yeah just wait
[6:21:42] <Melchior_the_Wise> i'm looking for my momma
[6:21:47] <graemebl> She has been aged beyond her years
[6:21:47] <NireFuster> @drunken_lemur oh god no LUL
[6:21:48] <RickyRelucent> dint
[6:21:50] <PizzicatoFive5> the Laura Bailey portrayal makes it more obvious that she's a teenager, but it's just not worth it
[6:21:50] <+Breaknoon> she's 19 officially
[6:21:50] <dukenux> My momma, i mean mother
[6:21:51] <KaiserMario> My MAMA
[6:22:02] <marshalmorphino22> My Mama
[6:22:04] <%CappuccinoGuil> Ask Pat why she looks like an adult
[6:22:06] <luftraumm1> itsd a defense response to the horror of it all woolie, you just wished it was a husband
[6:22:07] <%livlinn> @thomasvalentine31 LUL
[6:22:07] <Ieatzombees> No shes 17
[6:22:11] <peachy996> Ohhh
[6:22:13] <Melchior_the_Wise> Beat me up, like he did
[6:22:16] <rabbitective> she's 19
[6:22:22] <NireFuster> Well, yeah, her father did do something to her
[6:22:24] <%dds333a> It could definitely mean both
[6:22:28] <luftraumm1> wiki says 19
[6:22:28] <%livlinn> @marshalmorphino22 Best girl joofbCry
[6:22:34] <Ieatzombees> Shes not 19
[6:22:41] <rabbitective> but she is
[6:22:43] <NireFuster> No no no no Angela is totally seeing James, not a monster
[6:22:47] <PizzicatoFive5> Woolie what the fuck are you talking about
[6:22:47] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[6:22:49] <Ieatzombees> Canon is 17
[6:22:51] <NireFuster> She's not mistaking him for a monster or his father or something
[6:22:54] <rabbitective> no it isn't
[6:22:55] <%noxlunesia> I mean, ultimately we shouldn't expect Woolie to understand it the first time. He just put the controller down, it took me multiple playthroughs to 'get it'.
[6:22:58] <%dds333a> Makes sense
[6:22:58] <+BelricPsytar> what...
[6:23:00] <%Th3SmartAlec> You... made a jump there/
[6:23:07] <AngryAsian5> LUL
[6:23:08] <NotHereToStream> ??
[6:23:08] <NireFuster> WHAT LUL
[6:23:09] <peachy996> I get it. When you heard her say "Men only want one thing" you thought she was a bitter wife
[6:23:10] <dukenux> Kappa
[6:23:12] <luftraumm1> it is necessarilly obtuse too
[6:23:13] <jett_eyes> well, I mean...
[6:23:14] <jorniev> or
[6:23:15] <+BelricPsytar> WHAT
[6:23:16] <PizzicatoFive5> Woolie did you pay any attention
[6:23:16] <jorniev> OR
[6:23:16] <Dr_Mooose> uhh
[6:23:18] <NireFuster> UHM
[6:23:22] <marshalmorphino22> Uhhh
[6:23:23] <umbraawitch> you're not supposed to get it on the first playthrough
[6:23:23] <BlackermanZX> big mr fantastic stretch
[6:23:24] <jorniev> OOOOOR
[6:23:24] <Nabs96> chat just let it go. woolie is tired and has been playing for 7 hours

[6:23:26] <NireFuster> WOOLIE??? LUL
[6:23:27] <Ieatzombees> It's Konami
[6:23:30] <OblivionSword1> that's what she said
[6:23:30] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[6:23:30] <+Breaknoon> well, if he was abusing her she probably wouldnt refer to her as "daddy"
[6:23:31] <Afrosamasenpai> woolie's trying his best
[6:23:31] <JacknZack27> Yeah its fine. We can get into it in detail after the ending
[6:23:32] <%dds333a> it makes sense to me
[6:23:33] <+vegasbear92> it's gone from pat doesn't know what he's talking about to Woolie doesn't know what he's talking about
[6:23:33] <slackerunchained> But yeah. once again, i think PROXIMITY is the one case where a person can see other folks monsters. You met Angela. You took her knife. You read her story in the paper. You then fought the representation of her abusive Dad.
[6:23:34] <peachy996> I see your brain, Woolie. I see where you made the reach
[6:23:35] <jett_eyes> yeah, call James Daddy
[6:23:35] <%CappuccinoGuil> We get it, Woolz
[6:23:37] <%imthewisejanitor> LUL
[6:23:37] <+nanaki_ff14> Woolie
[6:23:37] <DrkJP520> Or maybe she does know you're James, and just doesn't trust men.
[6:23:38] <%Prevot> LUL
[6:23:38] <%noxlunesia> It'll make more sense with time. You're fine. You JUST saw the scene.

[6:25:53] <BlackermanZX> nah trauma
[6:25:54] <+HelveticaScenario> Woolie, she looks old because she's been through ABUSE
[6:25:56] <Pablox010> @WoolieVersus She's 19 but she looks older because of her rough and horrible upbringing she had
[6:26:00] <TenguGemini> she just is terrified of men
[6:26:00] <peachy996> You can sometimes hear Donna's natural accent in Angela's lines
[6:26:00] <RickyRelucent> some ppl treat a psychtic episode like a hangover
[6:26:01] <NireFuster> No no no, Angela is seeing James totally, she's not seeing her father
[6:26:02] <dukenux> At first i thought it was arrested development due to trauma
[6:26:04] <NireFuster> She's just afraid because trauma, Woolie
[6:26:05] <%dds333a> she immediately mistrusted james because he's male
[6:26:05] <PizzicatoFive5> I like her character more as a 30yo than a teenager

[6:26:14] <SyLuX45> Remember that in Silent Hill not everyone see things the same even people
[6:26:14] <marshalmorphino22> She thinks James is going to rape her because she only has negative experiences with men
[6:26:14] <%mcginnis90> @dds333a exactly
