[0:02:58] <%ringabal> Did ya win the war, son?
[0:03:01] <%sparkly_yoyo> did you reach the halo?
[0:03:02] <%SirGO0SE> tell him about the cole protocol

[0:03:11] <%doomerskeletor13> The Buck Protocol
[0:03:20] <@akuda_bar> @gunsrlove late because of a tough morning, that's all
[0:03:21] <Darren716> Damn that is an apt analogy
[0:03:24] <%KyoryUtchy> Origami King is fun, but it's a different ~kind~ of fun to TTYD. TTYD is great at being a "traditional" JRPG, while OK strong point is that you're doing a ton of weird stuff and the turn based battles are only one part of the equation.
[0:03:24] <%chosenjuan42> Paul Marketing says the War never ends
[0:03:25] <%Solidnick18> no it is not

[0:03:54] <Darren716> He has 2 more missions before credits
[0:04:00] <%SirGO0SE> that reaction gif of reggie is gold
[0:04:05] <%Euphbugg> Math powers will only help Paper Mario
[0:04:05] <%dekubaka> he's pretty near the endgame of ttyd
[0:04:05] <@akuda_bar> do you really need math when there's only two dimensions
[0:04:14] <%chosenjuan42> Reggie's Math is at MAX level

[0:05:01] <%Chatterbox1991> I can't wait for the Share Button 2.0 :)
[0:05:06] <%Proxzo> MICRO USB SUCKS
[0:05:06] <+gingersnipsnap> Botch away, fuck the haterz lucidLove
[0:05:12] <%BinaryFireball> MICRO USB IS FINE
[0:05:14] <NotHereToStream> can't wait for usb c soon
[0:05:17] <%BinaryFireball> I will fight you
[0:05:21] <%sparkly_yoyo> usb is just confusing, just give me a goddamn plug
[0:05:21] <+crimsonharvest> its like a fuse but for strain
[0:05:26] <scorpionoutcast> Are we legitimately in the Biking Reggie Arc?
[0:05:27] <Darren716> I have broken so many micro usbs, never had a problem with c's
[0:05:39] <%sparkly_yoyo> all my phone chargers die miserably
[0:05:40] <%emperordread> It's all a con by Big USB to make you buy way more cables than you need
[0:05:42] <%sparkly_yoyo> :(
[0:05:45] <ghoulishcripple> @sparkly_yoyo it was like a mid game mission. you go to a safehouse hidden behind a gross busted Gellato shop and the owner is a pretty racial stereotype. game was weird
[0:05:46] <%doomerskeletor13> Cheer500 whenever I‚Äôm having a bad day, these streams always put me in a better mood, no joke. Love y‚Äôall and your shenanigans. Keep on keeping on

[0:06:18] <%dekubaka> yeah but C doesn't work with all my old shit and what do I want two cords for >:[
[0:06:27] <+crimsonharvest> RJ as a connector can go to hell
[0:06:32] <+caskit_case> YO FUCK THOSE CLIPS FR
[0:06:33] <%Proxzo> When you have expensive drawing tablets that use older mini-usbs that break the port inside the device
[0:06:42] <%RyTYoung> yoyoyoyoyo
[0:06:54] <%Seancicle> recognizable example
[0:06:54] <Darren716> They become so loose and shit
[0:06:58] <%nmaten> facts
[0:07:01] <%valriot> PS3 controller is ruined by USB slot
[0:07:05] <%valriot> *PS4
[0:07:06] <ScandalousSam262> i think my ps4 controller has a weird form of drift? everytime i press L2, the controller acts as if im holding the left stick forward
[0:07:07] <%sparkly_yoyo> insertion makes things loose
[0:07:09] <%sparkly_yoyo> RULES OF NATURE
[0:07:11] <ghoulishcripple> @sparkly_yoyo I feel like there's a moment that dude smashes a roach on Gellato and offers it to you
[0:07:19] <CrematedCube> I have destroyed many headphone ports by tripping and use small extension cords as a tripguard, so I get why they're protecting the port
[0:07:51] <+RocketBarrel> I wished PS4 controllers could mod in TypeC
[0:08:13] <Darren716> C-ing it
[0:08:14] <%dekubaka> speaking of ports who else is fucking pissed at losing the headphone jack in phones
[0:08:17] <Prevot> thank fuck Switch already had it
[0:08:31] <%BinaryFireball> I literally don't understand how you guys are breaking wires so often
[0:08:45] <sunnythedrunk> Removing headphones jacks is the grimiest technology move I've ever seen
[0:09:00] <%BinaryFireball> I have a lot a micro usb cables
[0:09:05] <%BinaryFireball> an entire drawer
[0:09:05] <%krispen_wa> Unlimited Wire Works
[0:09:11] <%sparkly_yoyo> some people just live a WIRELIFE
[0:09:17] <+RocketBarrel> @binaryfireball because it breaks from sheer USE or if you drop your controller from 2 feet
[0:09:20] <%Solidnick18> um
[0:09:21] <%BinaryFireball> I have had only one break in like 5 years
[0:09:30] <+AJiiij> 40

[0:09:47] <%kulmoth> i have not broken a single one yet
[0:09:47] <%BinaryFireball> but I do replug everyday!
[0:09:48] <missingangle> 40? My gosh lol
[0:09:52] <%dekubaka> new phones: listen with bluetooth only now! :3 me: guess I'm never upgrading again
[0:09:52] <%doomerskeletor13> brownW
[0:09:55] <@akuda_bar> cable god
[0:10:00] <%Ahnassi> Not everyone uses those damn cables as nunchucks
[0:10:02] <%BinaryFireball> i am that one guy today
[0:10:07] <ScandalousSam262> i imagine woolie's setup just looks like his hair
[0:10:10] <+RocketBarrel> yup
[0:10:11] <%sparkly_yoyo> I try to keeps wiring to a minimum, now my parents, on the other hand, I've counted at least 60, without extensions
[0:10:12] <ThighsSupreme> Sounds like a lack of guests
[0:10:17] <prime_name> I remember how much of a pain it was to plug in everything for Video Game club in high school.
[0:10:17] <%GodlyLuigi> fireball have you every heard how HARD woolie holds a controller
[0:10:18] <@akuda_bar> I met this professional IT dude who had a fancy binder entirely for wires
[0:10:18] <+NickHatesSnow> I do IT so I get it
[0:10:22] <%Solidnick18> Woolies wire world
[0:10:27] <%Irridium> At this point I treat my USB-b stuff as wired things. never unplug them anymore. Primarily my PS4 and Xbone controllers because those seem to break the easiest on me
[0:10:38] <%yusefHD> been on a 4 month job hunt and you guys keep me sane fr BibleThump
[0:10:44] <CrematedCube> I mean... I have a Dreamcast that never needed a repair. Some people get good luck
[0:10:57] <+RocketBarrel> I bought Micro USB 3 weeks ago and it broke in 3 days because I dropped my controller
[0:10:59] <+NickHatesSnow> OH THOSE ARE THE WORST
[0:11:02] <%dekubaka> @yusefhd stay strong out there buddy
[0:11:08] <Prevot> yeah Dualshock 4 you might as well leave plugged in, not only because of the USB but the battery itself being garbage
[0:11:13] <%Seancicle> ü§ôüèøü§ôüèª
[0:11:14] <Darren716> Ive had that happen on phone chargers, its the worse
[0:11:20] <%yusefHD> yerrr woolieSHOOK
[0:11:27] <CrematedCube> I've heard of Woolie's Dreamcast graveyard
[0:11:31] <%BinaryFireball> I am so confused
[0:11:34] <%krispen_wa> The absolute worst gen of USB
[0:11:35] <%sparkly_yoyo> oh i HATE THAT
[0:11:38] <oadf_threestrikes> my phone charger wires get fucked up so fast
[0:11:47] <+AJiiij> I got cousins that make fun of me for buying a new controller ever 2-3 years, yet when I visit them their shit is always broken sbfpSetIn
[0:11:48] <%JetpackMcQuack> JetpackMcQuack subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! Persona 4 Golden is a masterpiece but I have one question: What was Persona like before Mr Edogawa's TV Classroom?
[0:11:52] <+RocketBarrel> YEP THE WIRE EXPOSURE
[0:11:57] <%Irridium> @Prevot and then you sometimes get the fun glitch where the PS4 doesn't recognize the wire and thinks its a headset so you keep getting the "headset disconnected" message when doing anything
[0:11:58] <Grahfvitnir> Thanks for the HyperMayhem @jetpackmcquack
[0:11:59] <+RocketBarrel> FUCK IT
[0:12:02] <ThighsSupreme> Apple wires suck the big time
[0:12:06] <+NickHatesSnow> Worst wire since DSL

[0:13:35] <+NickHatesSnow> Ethernet 7 and 8 are strronger but still not amazing
[0:13:38] <%krispen_wa> Coax is the flimsiest piece of garbage ever
[0:13:51] <%sparkly_yoyo> ethernet does make a pretty satisfying sound tho
[0:13:52] <Darren716> Coax also takes work, fuck them
[0:13:53] <Prevot> oof yeah fuck Coax above all
[0:13:55] <%Irridium> THAT'S WHAT I DO! I keep it in the console because I can press it against the wall. Keeps it in.
[0:13:56] <noe_juan_kanobe> I'm treating my one good ethernet cable like porcelain

[1:10:21] <%chosenjuan42> Ghost writer punching it up
[1:10:22] <oadf_threestrikes> He is going on the adventure I think. but damn the published book is written by some. questionable people
[1:10:22] <cosmicgoatee> @grimshuck DSP tries falsifying his existence
[1:10:23] <Prevot> so, delusional or liar
[1:10:24] <+jiggy_snipe> no one ever tells the truth about the past
[1:10:27] <%ozmon> What if it's the author who's putting words in Luigi's honest, naive mouth
[1:10:27] <CrematedCube> Big advice: Cook some of your dried bouquets with some dried mushrooms
[1:10:27] <%kyh9> Wait, isn't Luigi actually going on these adventures?
[1:10:32] <%jinking79> sounds like someone with a perfectionist or god complex loser
[1:10:32] <dizimous> Dumbass lowkey needs to be thrown into a TV
[1:10:34] <%MayorRev> I'm pretty sure his writer is embellishing things
[1:10:41] <CrematedCube> You'll get good results and get some space
[1:10:48] <%Lion_kun> Maybe Luigi's brother is just salty.
[1:10:48] <%ringabal> Reminder that Luigi's Brawl Final Smash is an AT Field emitted by all the Negativity in his heart.
[1:10:57] <DavidComic> luigi is going on these adventures but he keeps winning while doing nothing
[1:10:57] <noe_juan_kanobe> Luigi hired ghostwriter to punch it up
[1:10:58] <+SlappyMeats> fake mammaries are also a thing
[1:11:01] <chirochan224> But if Luigi was writing they story, everyone would be a super preganat
[1:11:02] <+jiggy_snipe> yea human memory is garbage
[1:11:05] <SixthSun2> Noooo, the boat panel in this room NotLikeThis
[1:11:05] <%dekubaka> we know it's not him telling the story because of the last volume ;)
[1:11:08] <%Rosen_Thorne> oh yeah the new stage
[1:11:09] <%sparkly_yoyo> remember every time you won in life? fake memories
[1:11:13] <%Solidnick18> i been their before
[1:11:15] <%chosenjuan42> What if Luigi is telling the truth but the whole world is lying?
[1:11:16] <prime_name> Is all of this just a fake memory?
[1:11:17] <%SirGO0SE> yeah I've created scenariors that I found out later never happened
[1:11:18] <%DatAsuna> that's not sometimes reggie
[1:11:19] <Nomad94> you really can't trust your memory that much
[1:11:27] <DavidComic> Luigi might actually be ill
[1:11:33] <%DatAsuna> that's inherent to the function of memory
[1:11:33] <%Proxzo> Whoa, Goombella doing 10
[1:11:34] <%Solidnick18> i think some of them where dreams but idk
[1:11:38] <cosmicgoatee> dont forget you can jump up to grab pipes
[1:11:43] <%DatAsuna> it's every time
[1:11:43] <%hamahiroyuki> gaslighting you say then
[1:11:44] <%Solidnick18> oh cool badge
[1:11:44] <%Proxzo> LOOT
[1:11:48] <%GeneralSCPatton> Your memories get slightly rewritten every time you recall them.
[1:11:50] <%ChoculaUltra> imagine the biggest memories in your life being something your brain just constructed monkaS
[1:11:51] <%sparkly_yoyo> stop badgering my witness!
[1:11:56] <SixthSun2> @WoolieVersus You missed a boat panel back in that room
[1:11:59] <%DatAsuna> memory is not a read/write operation
[1:12:02] <Prevot> don't tell Edgeworth that
[1:12:02] <%Rosen_Thorne> so does luigi keep his ghost writer in his mansion?
[1:12:02] <Manmush> I mean you can talk to him
[1:12:06] <+caskit_case> luigi: american sniper
[1:12:10] <Manmush> the author
[1:12:12] <%kyh9> No, he's not the writer, I don't believe
[1:12:16] <%sparkly_yoyo> Luigi is too busy having ADVENTURE
[1:12:18] <%Th3SmartAlec> because he personally tells you the story?
[1:12:19] <CrematedCube> And he has partners, who confirm his big fat lies
[1:12:19] <+SlappyMeats> but if Luigi is illiterate... klinkHmm
[1:12:21] <%DatAsuna> it's why brain transfer stories are always weird
[1:12:25] <%ringabal> The author was actually Luigi's ghost dog
[1:12:29] <%Euphbugg> Ceiling to your left as well
[1:12:29] <%Rosen_Thorne> also ceiling pipes
[1:12:32] <GenericSoda> have you ever seen luigi write
[1:12:32] <%fly2555_of_the_rebellion> down
[1:12:32] <%ozmon> It's definitely his partners who really tell you the story straight
[1:12:32] <%glass_marcus> I just love the layers of embelishment from person to person
[1:12:35] <%chosenjuan42> go down
[1:12:36] <%cobalt_phoenix_> if memories are just brain chemicals or electrical synapses, can you zap memories into a brain?
[1:12:36] <%Irridium> written by igiul
[1:12:36] <citerel> is the writer the guy in rogueport?
[1:12:37] <SixthSun2> Below

[1:17:19] <gya0s> may as well get the xps and stylish training
[1:17:27] <ShiningAxis> they may be weak, but they're stronger than the execution
[1:17:49] <gya0s> das a good badge.
[1:18:02] <gya0s> i think you have one though
[1:18:04] <ScatterCatt> OMG Woolie's sleeves blend in with his couch, so I thought his arms were both over the back of the couch or something. I was so confused!

[1:44:34] <gya0s> Dizzy is whiff
[1:44:34] <aliab95> hit team
[1:44:37] <%cobalt_phoenix_> i think dizzy is whiff
[1:44:38] <%chosenjuan42> sometimes whiff
[1:44:40] <whiteblacklight74> whiff
[1:44:44] <%ChoculaUltra> so what are the good Paper Mario games? TTYD and the 1st one?
[1:44:51] <+Onlysamfisher > ^
[1:44:55] <whiteblacklight74> it's SMT panic
[1:44:56] <HomebrewdRPG> super is good too
[1:44:57] <Doomstricken> superstar saga
[1:45:00] <gya0s> Super is very different, but sick imo
[1:45:02] <Papa_Bearman> @ChoculaUltra First three.
[1:45:03] <%sparkly_yoyo> All except Sticker Star are good for different reasons
[1:45:04] <%Rosen_Thorne> @choculaultra all of them except sticker star from what I understand
[1:45:09] <%pectusumbra> yeah, panic is deadly. same in EO
[1:45:10] <Blunder_Blue> @ChoculaUltra 1, TTYD, and Super's STORY is good. Gameplay is kinda alright.
[1:45:11] <%SirGO0SE> GAME OVER YEAH
[1:45:12] <CrematedCube> Super Paper Mario is different yes but also good
[1:45:12] <%sparkly_yoyo> That said, first three are best
[1:45:13] <%Chatterbox1991> GAME OVER YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
[1:45:15] <%TheRisingPride> @ChoculaUltra Those 2 and Super are most well regarded, Color splash has fun writing but bad gameplay
[1:45:16] <Zohare> I like FF7's spinning confusion the most
[1:45:23] <HomebrewdRPG> i do not accept color splash you heathens
[1:45:25] <Doomstricken> superstar saga is a great paper mario game
[1:45:34] <%chosenjuan42> flurries fog, lucky badges, dodgy cape, confused enemies leads to ULTRA INSTINCT
[1:45:36] <Papa_Bearman> Super Paper Mario is a draw mostly for the story. The gameplay really depends on your tastes.
[1:45:45] <%ringabal> [B L O C K E D]
[1:45:45] <whiteblacklight74> tetrakarn + makarakarn
[1:45:45] <%pectusumbra> almighty bypasses those generally
[1:45:46] <Papa_Bearman> You can get the pipe in this room.
[1:45:46] <%sparkly_yoyo> Confusion in RPG never makes sense,
[1:45:51] <%DensityD> VIOLENCE
[1:45:54] <%ChoculaUltra> ah I see I see. Gonna give Superstar Saga a spin this weekend
[1:46:00] <cosmicgoatee> @woolieversus remember the up high chest in the sewers?
[1:46:06] <+BlockingDisabled> Megido spells arent affected IIRC
[1:46:10] <%fly2555_of_the_rebellion> sleep
[1:46:10] <shiny_prinny> i think you do
[1:46:10] <whiteblacklight74> megidolaon actually ignores makarakarn @woolieversus
[1:46:15] <%dekubaka> @sparkly_yoyo disagree,nI get confused all the time and sometimes I hurt myself
[1:46:15] <Papa_Bearman> You can sleep in the cabin to make time go faster.
[1:46:16] <%sparkly_yoyo> play the advance/ds games, the 3DS one got neutered
[1:46:19] <grimshuck> you do

[1:55:44] <spardanwarrior> Woolie needed to go on the train for a sidequest
[1:55:45] <shiny_prinny> yeah, good thing you got the pipe beforehand
[1:55:50] <@akuda_bar> just wait till he sees the PickleStone thing in the next chapter
[1:55:50] <theCoolChild> Mario Peach is DYING!

[1:56:05] <+cubbywolf> So posh
[1:56:18] <%fly2555_of_the_rebellion> without the pipe you have to take it again
[1:56:22] <%doomerskeletor13> Mario needs an Ebon Hawk
[1:56:25] <gya0s> that's the WOOOOORST
[1:56:35] <cosmicgoatee> someone should make a meme edit of the lets gooo with that Toad
[1:56:38] <+cubbywolf> it sucks the first few times but then you get used to the extra walk
[1:56:41] <%doomerskeletor13> I fell asleep on a school bus when I was a kid

[1:56:51] <2017y> @cosmicgoatee go where?
[1:56:55] <NotHereToStream> headphones on too
[1:56:56] <%LoVezineTheAir> Origami King at least fixed that problem, there are like 5 different methods of fast travels
[1:56:58] <CrematedCube> I can't sleep on public transit because that fear is always too strong
[1:57:00] <@akuda_bar> i was such a nerd sometimes i'd get too into my book and miss my stop

[1:57:36] <2017y> your body feels the acceleration and the turns
[1:57:42] <%doomerskeletor13> Man as someone who lives in a rural town I‚Äôve never taken a train, it sounds so foreign to me
[1:57:47] <%TheRisingPride> I did the same thing for bus stops for about a year in college
[1:57:51] <2017y> could snooze on the bus home from school and work
[1:57:56] <%doomerskeletor13> I just drive or bike everywhere
[1:58:01] <bryxobryx> I‚Äôm looking away because I‚Äôm following the YouTube timeline, but I came here to suggest Bug Fables for the roster.
[1:58:25] <%sparkly_yoyo> BTW, the reason Riverside Station was so weird is because they cut a Beldam fight from it that tied the whole thing together
[1:58:29] <bryxobryx> The writing is only serviceable, but the gameplay is tighter than this by miles

[2:03:32] <%ChoculaUltra> @bryxobryx Woolz and Reg seldom read the chat during gameplay, but if ya want them to peep it your best bet is a dono as they check them at the end of every stream

[2:32:01] <cosmicgoatee> imagine spending money on anything less than luxury fu fu fu
[2:32:04] <+Starlight_Gamer> ?
[2:32:06] <%Proxzo> so you store it so you can have more than 999 gold
[2:32:09] <gya0s> running away, plus you can't gather coins in the overworld when you're at max
[2:32:15] <%sparkly_yoyo> you can only lose coins by running away

[2:38:48] <%sparkly_yoyo> out here changing lives
[2:38:50] <Papa_Bearman> Honestly, Woolie, after your "Towel Tech" story, I was skeptical.
[2:38:52] <%chosenjuan42> WOOLIE 100% CORRECT
[2:38:53] <+dollarstored> @WoolieVersus crazy things white people say
[2:38:54] <Daniel_Is_I> Woolie you do realize that the bottom chips are going to taste better if you eat it right-side up based on that logic, yes?
[2:38:56] <+StrawberryPantsu> The dust doesn't fall though sou you end up with the bad chips at the end
[2:38:58] <abelincoln_catpuncher> @thatguychris93 watch the podcast lol
[2:38:58] <%chiluzza> SAY THE LINE
[2:39:00] <%Livelinne> Chips war woolieLORE
[2:39:04] <cosmicgoatee> total Fabrication
[2:39:05] <%glass_marcus> Chip Tech> Towel Tech> Barf Tech
[2:39:07] <+Zepshire> what chips have that much dust at the bottom
[2:39:07] <%ringabal> People are afraid of change, Woolie.
[2:39:07] <theCoolChild> X For
[2:39:07] <@akuda_bar> bottom become top
[2:39:11] <%Livelinne> woolieFABRICATION woolieFABRICATION woolieFABRICATION
[2:39:15] <%krispen_wa> BOTTOM PEEL GANG
[2:39:16] <reonome> i do that
[2:39:17] <ghoulishcripple> just shake the fucking bag
[2:39:20] <Zeif00> Potato chips aren't keto btw
[2:39:21] <%SirGO0SE> backward? stem is the holder
[2:39:21] <%chiluzza> you wont get the stringy bits
[2:39:23] <damienlunas> Bottom Peel is the fucking tech
[2:39:35] <Papa_Bearman> After your "Towel Tech" thing that didn't work for me, I just felt like you were a crazy guy in front of a bulletin board with a bunch of pushpins and yarn.
[2:39:37] <+MagiKestral> either way is fine as long as you get out 90% of the banana
[2:39:40] <abelincoln_catpuncher> botton peel is soooo much easierb
[2:39:41] <%TheRisingPride> You're right
[2:39:44] <%Solidnick18> i can't eat bananas so i'm good
[2:39:44] <%CommanderSqueaks> Bottom Peel gets rid of the strings.
[2:39:44] <%kyh9> JUST PUT THE LOGO RIGHT SIDE UP
[2:39:45] <straycatrock> just eat the peel why is everyone throwing away free nutrients
[2:39:46] <PhantomMaskJr> Believing in what Pat says majinoHooksubs
[2:39:46] <cosmicgoatee> is this hating on banana chips? Oh
[2:39:46] <%glass_marcus> Bottom peel is just easier 100% of the time
[2:39:50] <Prevot> bowl gang will always be superior
[2:39:53] <%CommanderSqueaks> Bottom Peel is 100% better tech
[2:39:58] <%kyh9> STOP FUCKING WITH ME WOOLIE, PUT THE LOGO RIGHT, IT CANT BE OFF
[2:40:04] <cosmicgoatee> I like dried pineapple pieces but only occasionally
[2:40:05] <%sparkly_yoyo> Reversible logos, that's gonna be the gamechanger
[2:40:06] <damienlunas> The bag opens better at the top
[2:40:09] <allmightythunder> Invest in reversable logo chip bags
[2:40:13] <%yusefHD> look at sunhilegends likes woolieGASM woolieGASM woolieGASM
[2:40:15] <%kyh9> NO, YOURE A HERETIC
[2:40:17] <+MechArch> what if you stored it at home upside down?
[2:40:24] <%kyh9> That's all very reasonable but we have to burn heretics
[2:40:25] <Skeletonmanners> just dump the shit into a bowl and dont have this dump convo
[2:40:33] <+blaze__drag> ULTIMATE PRO TECH IDEA: what if you just store the bags upside down
[2:40:34] <%sparkly_yoyo> pringles are doomed
[2:40:38] <%fly2555_of_the_rebellion> you cant flip it
[2:40:43] <cosmicgoatee> Pringles are even tubed
[2:40:45] <Zohare> Pringles are always broken and terrible for me
[2:40:45] <henshin2289> OOC WOOLIE Gravity mean bottom become top. XD
[2:40:49] <%ringabal> I have Woolie to thank for teaching his Cupcake tech
[2:40:49] <%SirGO0SE> pringles are not good bang for your buck but they rule
[2:40:55] <%TheRisingPride> Okay, I'm gonna apply a separate tech. When I bring the chip home, I'll store the bag upside down so that when I open it, I can do it rightside up
[2:41:03] <CrematedCube> Your analogy is bad
[2:41:07] <Prevot> pringles are bougie chips
[2:41:13] <cosmicgoatee> Pizza Pringles > All except maybe bbq
[2:41:19] <Daniel_Is_I> Woolie, the "better" chips are at the bottom anyway. You're just reversing the order, you're not distributing shit.
[2:41:21] <big_booty_animemilf> just open bag from the middle
[2:41:24] <%CommanderSqueaks> Untrue
[2:41:24] <+jiggy_snipe> no
[2:41:25] <%chosenjuan42> BAG MILK
[2:41:29] <ghoulishcripple> commit woolie. flip the cereal
[2:41:32] <damienlunas> Opening the banana from the top works less than 100% of the time, bottom opening works EVERY TIME.
[2:41:33] <+jiggy_snipe> you empty the bag anyway
[2:41:34] <SixthSun2> And YET you Canadians drink BAGGED MILK
[2:41:34] <%CommanderSqueaks> Bottom peel is better tech.
[2:41:37] <CrematedCube> The bottom-banana tech makes it easier to open
[2:41:47] <%SirGO0SE> bottom is the new top in all scenarios
[2:41:48] <+AbnormalVoid> Pringles also suck
[2:41:50] <ghoulishcripple> do you flip you Bagged Milk Woolie?
[2:41:51] <cosmicgoatee> I have literally heard of banana bottom strats
[2:41:53] <CrematedCube> Taste don't matter much but it is easier
[2:41:56] <cosmicgoatee> never*

[2:42:52] <cosmicgoatee> remember collecting thosr
[2:42:57] <Daniel_Is_I> GET A JUG
[2:42:58] <%sparkly_yoyo> People who don't flip their bags smell bad and don't rotate their saves
[2:43:02] <%SeBigBoss> open the milk bag upside down
[2:43:03] <Prevot> milk isn't expensive lol
[2:43:07] <CrematedCube> It's mostly a reaction of "BUT WHY THO"
[2:43:15] <%TubeMan642> Get jugs of milk guys
[2:43:18] <Daniel_Is_I> Plastic jugs are a thing.
[2:43:19] <ghoulishcripple> jug tech
[2:43:20] <Darren716> How do you fuck that up?
[2:43:20] <@akuda_bar> who uses paper cartons, even. you just get a jug
[2:43:21] <SixthSun2> Plastic jugs, though
[2:43:21] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh god we're back on Milk Bags.
[2:43:32] <%CommanderSqueaks> Just get plastic jugs.
[2:43:33] <%Livelinne> Go get your drinks already woolieDATTEBAYO
[2:43:36] <%sparkly_yoyo> get a drum and a hose

[2:43:46] <SixthSun2> Milk Bags never go away, it's constantly lurking in the shadows ready to strike
[2:43:48] <%CommanderSqueaks> Why is Woolie shocked by the idea of plastic jugs for milk
[2:43:49] <whirly25> are bagged milks cereal sized
[2:43:49] <%ozzrabbit> Woolie, most milk in the us comes in plastic jugs.
[2:43:50] <Daniel_Is_I> US dairy is heavily subsidized so it's cheaper here
[2:43:52] <%sparkly_yoyo> I imagine Luigi patiently listening to this
[2:43:54] <%Solidnick18> lmao
[2:43:56] <%TubeMan642> Milk comes in jugs

[2:44:24] <%sparkly_yoyo> Canada's not the only place with bagged milk guys
[2:44:25] <%CommanderSqueaks> Close mindedness, but refuses to open a banana from the BOTTOM
[2:44:25] <SixthSun2> Yes, and that's way better than bags
[2:44:26] <%SeBigBoss> Lets introduce more inferior ways to consume food and drink :)
[2:44:26] <%cobalt_phoenix_> wait nvm
[2:44:27] <%SirGO0SE> did you know that milk bags are just plastic tiddies?
[2:44:27] <%pectusumbra> And we got rid of it because glass is heavy and sucks to transport
[2:44:29] <%ringabal> BUT IT WAS STILL A HARD CONTAINER
[2:44:30] <+dollarstored> the milk man was the primary suspect in adultery
[2:44:30] <abelincoln_catpuncher> yooo the milkman was lowkey the player back in the day @woolieversus
[2:44:31] <%Solidnick18> but i wasn't around then so it doesn't exist
[2:44:34] <%CommanderSqueaks> Bottles better than BAGS
[2:44:35] <Zeif00> No I am right, everyone else is wrong
[2:44:36] <+jiggy_snipe> drink straight from the cow Kappa
[2:44:37] <%cobalt_phoenix_> GLASS BOTTLES ARE THE BEST
[2:44:43] <%CommanderSqueaks> Bags were a downgrade from bottle.
[2:44:44] <damienlunas> Woolie using moral relativism to justify INFERIOR BANANA TECH
[2:44:44] <Daniel_Is_I> You need a jug for your milk bag anyway, just put it in the jug
[2:44:46] <cosmicgoatee> You'd leave the bottles outside for the milkman to collect as well
[2:44:46] <@akuda_bar> i drink my milk crunchy tbh

[2:51:27] <gya0s> You have to get creative to kill someone with an empty milk bag.
[2:51:34] <ShinobiPhoenix> @phd_in_thuggery it's called Vortex Infinitum, it's Robo-Ky's song from the Korean version of Guilty Gear X2
[2:51:35] <%eriksdrums> Is this what Japan thinks sex is?!
[2:51:48] <Ner234> For those that don't realize: Woolie puts the song name in the bottom left.
[2:51:49] <Zeif00> Have you been blessed by the fruit of knowledge?
[2:51:50] <%chosenjuan42> clean pants
[2:51:56] <%crimsonphoenix69> woah things turned dark
[2:51:57] <%sparkly_yoyo> let's resume, pretend nothing happened
[2:51:57] <ghoulishcripple> like ask yourself. would you rather take a bag of milk to the face or a Jug of milk to the face
[2:51:58] <%ringabal> @eriksdrums It's what they wish it could always be
[2:52:18] <ShinobiPhoenix> that is totally a Gamecube controller in Woolie's hand
[2:52:29] <%krispen_wa> He lives in 2017
[2:52:35] <%chosenjuan42> slow but generous man
[2:52:37] <+masterMau> OH SHIT the thousand year door!!!
[2:52:38] <prime_name> So egg?
[2:52:42] <%LastHazzerd> let that be a lesson, don't mention inter-species reviewers
[2:52:48] <SethKyu> custom gamecube controller :0
[2:52:49] <Darren716> Yoo Woolie's streaming now?
[2:52:50] <PhantomMaskJr> larxaLurk sorry dude
[2:52:54] <%SirGO0SE> oh shit wasteland is some untapped potential
[2:52:59] <ShinobiPhoenix> ULTRA-Custom Gamecube controller
[2:53:06] <dinnydanny777> Does it have Bugsnax?
[2:53:09] <mugglus> not true
[2:53:11] <%chosenjuan42> SUPER PAPER MARIO
[2:53:15] <Rhinoprotoss> There's no stylish moves in Bug Fables
[2:53:18] <+blaze__drag> Bug Fables is the shit
[2:53:20] <Prevot> nah bug fables writing is pretty good
[2:53:21] <damienlunas> that's fair
[2:53:25] <%bread_assassin> Woolie can't be bought.
[2:53:26] <%SirGO0SE> nothing but bangers
[2:53:27] <SixthSun2> Definitely go back to 64 sometime
[2:53:31] <+blaze__drag> and yeah I thought bug fable's writing was perfectly good
[2:53:32] <damienlunas> Very fair
[2:53:33] <%sparkly_yoyo> fuck everything play pokemon pinball
[2:53:34] <%chosenjuan42> SPM has amazing story but it's a platforming
[2:53:41] <+Keyblade97> dude bug fables would be a great watch
[2:53:46] <Darren716> Fuck Bugfables, SPM
[2:53:49] <ShinobiPhoenix> nah, Woolie could move on to another type of game, one Paper Mario for now is anotehr
[2:54:02] <ShinobiPhoenix> enough
[2:54:07] <%LuckyLagomorph> Publisher's bad but the devs are great
[2:54:19] <%DesertBear88> DesertBear88 subscribed with Twitch Prime.
[2:54:20] <%doomerskeletor13> Just got back, they wrapping up or taking a break?
[2:54:22] <%SirGO0SE> young dad Pogchamp
[2:54:24] <%CommanderSqueaks> Lumpy Speedwagon
[2:54:30] <%chosenjuan42> BUGSNAX
[2:54:36] <$phd_in_thuggery> He almost named me Akuma, NO JOKE
[2:54:37] <@akuda_bar> GamerDad
[2:54:37] <+blaze__drag> I will say Paper Mario is generally funnier tbf, but I still thought Bug Fable's plot was pretty good
[2:54:37] <%sparkly_yoyo> My dad only plays Mario Kart Double Dash
[2:54:40] <%sparkly_yoyo> Literally
[2:54:43] <CrematedCube> Took a break to prepare for Tales of Luigi
[2:54:53] <noe_juan_kanobe> @doomerskeletor13 Just back from break
[2:54:54] <cosmicgoatee> I love how bugsnax became a meme
[2:54:55] <Zeif00> Vidya Dads are the best
[2:55:07] <Clear_Truth> @WoolieVersus Would you be willing to stream Einhander?
[2:55:10] <shamrocs> Didn't it say both?
[2:55:11] <%eriksdrums> I did not want to be remembered for this
[2:55:11] <dinnydanny777> Talkin' bout Bugsnax
[2:55:12] <%CommanderSqueaks> Panik
[2:55:16] <dinnydanny777> Ooooowooooooooooo
[2:55:17] <+Williamld> How Arcane Kappa
[2:55:33] <%CommanderSqueaks> @eriksdrums Too late
[2:55:34] <+jiggy_snipe> and if you see a bunch of crazy nonsense back to back, stream is over
[2:55:37] <%ringabal> And then there's this fucklechuck
[2:55:43] <cosmicgoatee> oh boy weegi time
[2:56:01] <%kyh9> And the Four Heroes Lore
[2:56:03] <%Euphbugg> Weegi time
[2:56:10] <alphalejandro> Again, is time for another Luigi Jorge Joestar story time
[2:56:13] <%kyh9> TOO EXPERIMENTAL
[2:56:16] <%kyh9> TOO FANFICTION
[2:56:19] <Spinydoughnut33> game audio is very low
[2:56:33] <SixthSun2> Speaking of interesting side stuff, go check out the roof lore rat guy in east rogueport, he's definitely got new stuff now.
[2:56:33] <theCoolChild> Thanks for the HyperCrown @desertbear88
[2:56:39] <%CommanderSqueaks> MIyamoto hates story
[2:56:45] <Darthkitten_Prime> Origami king is doing a little better, but still far from the first three.
[2:56:51] <cosmicgoatee> interestingly enough Origami king has its merits, especially those of adventure
[2:56:57] <CrematedCube> He's aware of lore rat, he'll get there
[2:56:58] <%sparkly_yoyo> Mario can have new characters, but they can't be based on old ones
[2:57:07] <dizimous> Origami King doesn't have this kind of world building and not this kind of variety in desgins, but it's still very charming
[2:57:10] <%sparkly_yoyo> Meaning we can't have new toads or goombas
[2:57:21] <cosmicgoatee> but yeah the designs took a hit somewhat
[2:57:24] <+KityLinn> piantas
[2:57:32] <Prevot> as recently as Odyssey they added new kinds of enemies
[2:57:39] <thesickestzak> PogChamp hydroxychloroquine PogChamp
[2:57:40] <fault_417> Baby pink gold Rosalina or some shit
[2:57:50] <%chosenjuan42> those cool day of the dead skull people in Odesssy
[2:57:58] <%sparkly_yoyo> Btw it's not a joke, the fact characters can't be personalized is actual company policy
[2:57:58] <%kulmoth> maybe when miyamoto croaks we can get some cool new paper mario
[2:58:02] <%kyh9> It's literally like a Kingdom-Hearts expansion of Mario Lore
[2:58:09] <gya0s> look at this marshmallow sperm motherfucker right here. You'll never see him again.
[2:58:10] <cosmicgoatee> I think my issue with Origami king is the sheer amount of Toads
[2:58:18] <Darthkitten_Prime> @dizimous Yeah, it has some really fun writing, a really pretty world, and the music is fantastic. It reminds me more of Luigi's Mansion, funnily enough.
[2:58:21] <%kyh9> There are interviews about this actually
[2:58:22] <%CommanderSqueaks> To be fair, there are absolutely elements that I would totally not put in what's meant to be a game kids are gonna play, like the fucking noose.
[2:58:24] <Prevot> @kulmoth not if kensuke tanabe is still in charge
[2:58:26] <%sparkly_yoyo> They think it scares new players
[2:58:27] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1295605483974295559
[2:58:28] <+jiggy_snipe> maybe it's too much work
[2:58:28] <CrematedCube> When characters in one game get their own fanfiction in the next game
[2:58:40] <%DatAsuna> Not people, just he bossman
[2:58:42] <SoratheWonderful> ü§î true
[2:58:47] <%Proxzo> Origami King is actually pretty good
[2:58:52] <%chosenjuan42> I feel unfortunately never will get old style since new sold better.
[2:58:55] <%SirGO0SE> theyre employing the Little V strategy of "ask for it, we'll give the opposite :) "
[2:58:55] <%fly2555_of_the_rebellion> not as well but still great
[2:59:02] <%KaitlynnHere> i think it's because it was offbrand and nintendo doesn't like their IP's being fucked with, even within their company
[2:59:05] <%DatAsuna> Corporate life = executives being their own data point
[2:59:15] <%Proxzo> They are sort of turning a corner with Origami King.
[2:59:20] <%KaitlynnHere> it sells so don't fuck with it
[2:59:20] <SixthSun2> A lot of people are putting Origami alongside 64 in how good it is, which is a compliment
[2:59:23] <CrematedCube> It feels like Discworld
[2:59:25] <%Solidnick18> yeah
[2:59:29] <dizimous> I will say in the record the Origami king kind of fucks. Still sad that we don't get this kind if stuff still but I love it anyways
[2:59:39] <%CommanderSqueaks> Origami King from what I could see, was a decent step in a not terrible direction.
[2:59:43] <Darren716> I mean Sticker Star and OK out sold this one
[2:59:50] <%DatAsuna> Having played origami, that's stockholm syndrome
[2:59:50] <%chosenjuan42> Sticker star sold well because we thought it would be old system. Oragami king sold well because of quarantine
[2:59:52] <%kyh9> I just sent you the interview
[2:59:57] <%nxflre> MArio movie is coming tho
[2:59:58] <%sparkly_yoyo> some people inside Nintendo are clearly trying to give the games some more personality, but they have to basically sneak it in
[3:00:02] <%DatAsuna> people said colour s[;ash was just as good too
[3:00:03] <Prevot> getting 10% of the charm of old paper mario games won't make me play Origami King if gameplay is still trash
[3:00:04] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Darren716 They were also not on a system many consider a failure.
[3:00:12] <%DatAsuna> sticker star just battered them
[3:00:15] <%Proxzo> OK went in a better direction. I think it deserves it numbers outside of quarantine
[3:00:16] <Aeonknight_87> Luigi and NegaLuigi
[3:00:17] <%CommanderSqueaks> Digital downloading also bumped up numbers.
[3:00:24] <%SirGO0SE> and it is @Prevot :(
[3:00:25] <%glass_marcus> Origami king also sold well because it has a way better install base
[3:00:35] <%DatAsuna> it's the chibi robo effect
[3:00:36] <%Euphbugg> ResidentSleeper
[3:00:44] <%ringabal> Is this Nier?
[3:00:44] <%ChoculaUltra> its funny because Nintendo is all about presenting something "fun" for everyone, except they hate fun no fun allowed
[3:00:49] <%DatAsuna> star fox got the same treatment
[3:00:49] <%Proxzo> It's a good game. Just not a full RPG experiencce like TTYD.
[3:00:56] <cosmicgoatee> Luigi Automata?
[3:00:59] <Prevot> the last 3 paper mario sales numbers are all because of the platforms they were on
[3:01:00] <%KaitlynnHere> ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[3:01:30] <%Proxzo> OK was good. I don't think that's fair to say about it. Not entirely due to install base.
[3:01:41] <%chosenjuan42> I just want a TTYD remake so it can be on something before besides GC
[3:01:43] <%DatAsuna> Miyamoto would kill any star fox without a gimmick post gamecube too
[3:01:46] <fault_417> You want attachment percentage, not raw sales numbers apparently
[3:02:09] <cosmicgoatee> Luigiana Jones and the Last Crusade
[3:02:09] <%ChoculaUltra> Woolie is completely checked out LUL
[3:02:11] <%ringabal> Woolie actually on his phone
[3:02:14] <whiteblacklight74> Protheans?
[3:02:15] <sunnythedrunk> Fuck Nintendo's need for "innovation"
[3:02:22] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[3:02:22] <sunnythedrunk> actually fucking asinine
[3:02:24] <blitzmentalist> ResidentSleeper
[3:02:31] <damienlunas> Yo that's a good name.
[3:02:33] <%chiluzza> god this would be an amazing game as well
[3:02:37] <sunnythedrunk> Rip starfox and F-zero for not being gimmicky enough
[3:02:39] <%DatAsuna> basically miyamoto/others re so gunshy after the gamecube they're sceptical that you can have conventional gameplay and succeed
[3:02:43] <+AbnormalVoid> oh god, its eyes are mouths
[3:02:44] <%sparkly_yoyo> just give me a Mario RPG, I don't care how, just an actual JRPG. Also that Rabbids game is actually pretty good
[3:02:54] <%ringabal> Hatesong sounds like a Rave Master tower
[3:02:54] <gya0s> I'll cream-fill an Eclair
[3:03:01] <@akuda_bar> luigi will figure it out
[3:03:04] <blitzmentalist> Godspeed Luigi
[3:03:10] <%ChoculaUltra> I mean everyone wanted a Wii U because of the gimmicks amirite Kappa
[3:03:12] <damienlunas> Hate. Song. Tower.
[3:03:13] <fault_417> Nintendo learned the wrong lesson from the success of the Wii
[3:03:19] <%PunkMcFox> "She's totally real, bro."
[3:03:22] <SixthSun2> Luigi's partner Screamy there is a recolor of the beta design for Smorgs.
[3:03:25] <%sparkly_yoyo> Godspeed Luigi, save the world so we can fuck it up by dying in our final battle
[3:03:29] <%fly2555_of_the_rebellion> goombella
[3:03:36] <%kyh9> fug
[3:03:37] <damienlunas> fuck you

[3:04:00] <%kyh9> SCREAMERS, GET OUT
[3:04:05] <%TheRisingPride> Luigi's semen companion
[3:04:05] <powerprotoman> screamy doesnt have eyes
[3:04:12] <powerprotoman> only mouths
[3:04:21] <%KaitlynnHere> @kyh9 NO
[3:04:23] <CrematedCube> I have no eyes and must scream
[3:04:25] <%ChoculaUltra> Screamy will be the one to turn out the lights and lock the door at the end of time.
[3:04:25] <SixthSun2> He's a recolored beta Smorg @WoolieVersus
[3:04:33] <gya0s> The Paper Mario Jolene AMV is the best thing, btw
[3:04:33] <+regis_j_rock> Screamy got some cool development history
[3:04:34] <prime_name> I'm pretty sure Screamy is a fetish
[3:04:36] <%Solidnick18> lol
[3:05:04] <cosmicgoatee> next Luigi is surely the last
[3:05:12] <gya0s> fuck his quest, btw
[3:05:13] <%sparkly_yoyo> That was 20 years ago tho
[3:05:14] <%chosenjuan42> those cool flippy ducks
[3:05:19] <%nicversus> oh they're back
[3:05:26] <%nicversus> why did they have to go, I missed it
[3:05:38] <%bread_assassin> Everyone remembers the piantas, but whatever happened to the Ricos.
[3:05:39] <@akuda_bar> only happens once
[3:05:39] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:05:41] <gya0s> @nicversus: Trouble quest
[3:05:47] <sunnythedrunk> I mean they added Lumas in galaxy and Cappys in Odyssey, their jsut very forgettable
[3:05:54] <+regis_j_rock> I'd say the 3D titles generally shake things up with characters and environments, but it's the rest of the franchise that's stagnant with the look.
[3:06:01] <+KityLinn> toksheLewd
[3:06:12] <+RadiantFalconGV> helo
[3:06:16] <%ChoculaUltra> I wouldn't mind a Bowser centric game with RPG elements tbh. Or even a management sim where you run the evil side of things.
[3:06:20] <gya0s> It's the one with Shawn Michaels in it.
[3:06:31] <Daniel_Is_I> Buff, sweaty men, woolie
[3:06:32] <Papa_Bearman> This is what we call A DIRT SHEET, BROTHER!!!
[3:06:32] <%Solidnick18> I have a bunch of those

[3:06:34] <Darren716> Shes reading the dirt sheets
[3:06:34] <Prevot> porn
[3:06:35] <fault_417> Piantas has a level of individuality that Lumas and Cappys really lack
[3:06:36] <%nxflre> looking at buff men
[3:06:40] <%ringabal> SHE'S STEALING AEW IDEAS
[3:06:41] <CrematedCube> Return the Bara
[3:06:42] <SoratheWonderful> *cough*
[3:06:42] <%KaitlynnHere> WHY YOU GOTTA BE TSUNDERE

[3:06:51] <+i_heart_gaming> is she looking at the sweaty half dressed men?
[3:06:52] <gya0s> Why is she borrowing it from.... Toodles?
[3:06:55] <cosmicgoatee> hmmm muscly bodies

[3:07:02] <%sparkly_yoyo> What is ... bara?
[3:07:03] <%Solidnick18> bin*
[3:07:03] <+linSP> Yo paper bowser would be insane @choculaultra

[3:07:05] <cosmicgoatee> SIDE CHESTO
[3:07:07] <%Livelinne> Mmmmmm wrestler bodies... woolieSMUG
[3:07:07] <+i_heart_gaming> I READ IT FOR THE TRENDS
[3:07:08] <JeoDood> lewds
[3:07:09] <%eriksdrums> Look. It's not weird to have a Walmart magazine. But 13 year old me got REAL defensive when mom fgound it in my room
[3:07:11] <SixthSun2> I think the joke is that she's actually checking out wrestlers
[3:07:13] <alphalejandro> could be a WCW one, you don't know
[3:07:14] <Prevot> it's full on bara porn
[3:07:14] <+jiggy_snipe> and why would Toodles have it? Kappa
[3:07:17] <Blunder_Blue> @gya0s Tootles was in Chapter 3 first as a Rwk Hawk fan.
[3:07:17] <+i_heart_gaming> SHE WAS READING IT FOR THE ARTICLES
[3:07:20] <%CommanderSqueaks> Why is Vince McMahon watching AEW!?
[3:07:23] <CrematedCube> Bara = guys blasting chest
[3:07:24] <Darren716> Because she needs to see what got leaked out to the dirt sheets
[3:07:32] <+Juriasu> SNOOF
[3:07:34] <%Solidnick18> ahhhh
[3:07:36] <%sparkly_yoyo> gobbs
[3:07:37] <gya0s> Woolie has a sickness for the quickness
[3:07:40] <spardanwarrior> Would you say that she reads it for the articles?
[3:07:48] <theCoolChild> Only one SNOOF?
[3:07:48] <%ringabal> "I'm sorry" says Woolie, his eyes hollowed out.
[3:07:56] <Papa_Bearman> Did you know that King K VS. Rawk Hawk was the first ***** match in Glitz Pit history?
[3:08:02] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[3:08:03] <jetboots> Woolie snoofs a snoof
[3:08:06] <%ChoculaUltra> these damn secrets man monkaS
[3:08:08] <+Juriasu> it is surely clear Kappa
[3:08:09] <%CommanderSqueaks> Woolie is sounding like a drug addict apologizing for falling off the wagon again.
[3:08:12] <%Solidnick18> but what if
[3:08:22] <%chosenjuan42> Glitzville Schrodinger's star piece
[3:08:34] <%ringabal> PFFFFT
[3:08:35] <+RadiantFalconGV> is that Gravity Suit Mario
[3:08:42] <gya0s> That's only because Grubba never booked Craw-Daddy for more than a 10-minuter, and you know that.
[3:08:53] <%chosenjuan42> hype
[3:08:55] <SixthSun2> @RadiantFalconGV It's WAAAA-vity Suit Mario
[3:08:58] <CrematedCube> I think they'll set off bombombs
[3:09:03] <Daniel_Is_I> They can burn I think
[3:09:11] <SoratheWonderful> Yet!
[3:09:17] <cosmicgoatee> @solidnick18 I were to disguise them as my own Snoofing? Ho ho, delightfully devilish, Mario
[3:09:26] <+RadiantFalconGV> I miss playing this game
[3:09:45] <+RadiantFalconGV> I miss Paper Mario. shame the series ended after the Wii title
[3:09:48] <Daniel_Is_I> It makes mario dodge
[3:09:51] <%chosenjuan42> just mario
[3:09:52] <CrematedCube> It's a small cloud around Mario
[3:09:55] <+regis_j_rock> That's not what the attack does Woolie
[3:09:57] <%chosenjuan42> Mario Ultra instinct
[3:10:01] <%TheRisingPride> It just gives Mario the "Dodgy" status
[3:10:03] <BlueFusionVolt> They do burn damage to you or the enemies if pointed at your direction
[3:10:10] <+regis_j_rock> It's a Repel Cape but as an attack
[3:10:21] <%Solidnick18> a little snoof here and their yes very good

[3:10:42] <%kyh9> So she's a celebrity gossip hound
[3:10:50] <ShiningAxis> sounds like Jolene just wants to be popular
[3:10:53] <gya0s> Oh, that's why the Starbucks john always smells like fish.

[3:27:15] <SoratheWonderful> Ouch
[3:27:33] <Papa_Bearman> Did you ever take the First Attack badge off?
[3:27:33] <+MechArch> stomp the dick!
[3:27:36] <CrematedCube> If you want to get rid of some dried bouquets in storage, I learned the best use for them
[3:28:02] <%fly2555_of_the_rebellion> across
[3:28:09] <shiny_prinny> it's where dazzle is
[3:28:10] <SixthSun2> First level, middle
[3:28:26] <%chosenjuan42> go up and left
[3:28:29] <An_Armed_Bear> I always remember getting lost in the underground
[3:28:29] <gya0s> dried bouquets are as useful now as they'll ever be.
[3:28:32] <%ringabal> Woolie took the RE2 route
[3:28:33] <CrematedCube> dried bouquet + anything HP or FP
[3:28:44] <CrematedCube> even a dried shroom will work
[3:29:04] <%sparkly_yoyo> wonky would tell you >:(
[3:29:07] <%sparkly_yoyo> ... probably
[3:29:07] <SixthSun2> Combine them with stuff like dried shrooms and mistakes to make a pretty good item @WoolieVersus
[3:29:23] <%chosenjuan42> most recipies are SECRET
[3:29:33] <Papa_Bearman> Wait, you lost 50 coins on that?!
[3:29:37] <%psidefx> Courage shell?
[3:29:43] <%Euphbugg> Shell?
[3:29:52] <zoopbooploop> Bolt, Shell,
[3:30:00] <SixthSun2> You could say it's... A MYSTERY
[3:30:05] <+linSP> bolt stinks
[3:30:07] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[3:30:08] <Papa_Bearman> I mean, Mystery is worth a whole coin!
[3:30:09] <%TheRisingPride> What is this bit?
[3:30:11] <Papa_Bearman> A WHOLE COIN!
[3:30:13] <%fly2555_of_the_rebellion> bolt
[3:30:19] <%chosenjuan42> ALL MYSTERY
[3:30:20] <cosmicgoatee> certainly is a...mystery
[3:30:29] <Sol_Install> yes
[3:30:30] <%sparkly_yoyo> You can cook a mystery with other item to make a random item (50%failure chance)
[3:30:33] <%psidefx> its a trip to the meadows that shell
[3:30:34] <Zohare> The mystery could be anything tho
[3:30:34] <%Euphbugg> yup :)
[3:30:34] <zoopbooploop> Why is Woolie shaming his co-host
[3:30:34] <Aeonknight_87> Clearly sell the Whacka Bump
[3:30:37] <dooronlatch> couples cake
[3:30:45] <%Rosen_Thorne> Shell‚Äôs useless anyway with Koops‚Äôs ability
[3:30:48] <Papa_Bearman> You're losing 50 coins for every Gold Bar x3 you buy.
[3:30:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> This is why Reggie lost Dokapon
[3:31:00] <%pectusumbra> also looked up what the bouquets are for. combine them with any healing item to get a unique food item
[3:31:03] <%nxflre> @zoopbooploop they shaming us for always recommending
[3:31:28] <smyld> Wacka wacka
[3:31:30] <An_Armed_Bear> Big Money Rustlas
[3:31:30] <CrematedCube> I recommend messing with bouquets to clear the vault
[3:31:43] <%sparkly_yoyo> Reggie, your gambling addiction is destroying our family
[3:31:48] <Papa_Bearman> @CrematedCube WE GET IT.
[3:32:11] <%chosenjuan42> ALL MYSTERY RUN

[3:35:21] <Nomad94> @Juriasu Did they? they give you sick powers
[3:35:21] <Blunder_Blue> They're pretending to be evil.
[3:35:23] <CrematedCube> That's why they were so half-hearted with the curses
[3:35:25] <%kyh9> They're actually helping
[3:35:31] <%kyh9> Ye
[3:35:32] <sunnythedrunk> They are self-aware

[3:35:59] <%nicversus> I like to imagine they each independently decided to do the whole evil curse schtick out of sheer boredom

[3:37:49] <BlueFusionVolt> Jabbies = Al Bhed Kappa
[3:37:51] <%nxflre> thats it lol

[3:38:45] <%kyh9> The monsters' appetites
[3:38:46] <%nxflre> THe monster's appetite
[3:38:47] <shiny_prinny> the monsters' appetites
[3:38:51] <Blunder_Blue> No, Woolz, the monster's appetites
[3:38:52] <spardanwarrior> The appetites of the MONSTERS not the PUNIES
[3:38:52] <Daniel_Is_I> THE MONSTERS APPETITES
[3:38:53] <%krispen_wa> The MONSTER's appetites
[3:38:54] <%kyh9> No, it's the monsters' appetites
[3:38:54] <%DukeBlack_> oh god
[3:38:55] <%kulmoth> the monsters appetite
[3:38:56] <Darren716> Woolie...
[3:38:58] <%ringabal> THE MONSTERS APPETITE
[3:38:59] <Rhinoprotoss> Woolie so good at reading
[3:39:01] <%kyh9> THE MONSTER'S APPETITES
[3:39:01] <spardanwarrior> Punies were the food
[3:39:01] <SixthSun2> the MONSTER"S appetites
[3:39:03] <%KyoryUtchy> The fierce appetites OF THE MONSTERS
[3:39:03] <%doomerskeletor13> Reading comprehension
[3:39:04] <Daniel_Is_I> Illiteracy
[3:39:04] <noe_juan_kanobe> No lore about Twilight?
[3:39:05] <%LastHazzerd> The Monsters were the things with the apetites
[3:39:07] <+DeRedBaron> re-reading it it means they were prey
[3:39:07] <Aeonknight_87> it's worded funny enough to be interpreted either way
[3:39:08] <%Proxzo> "their" probably refer to the monsters
[3:39:09] <zoopbooploop> ...
[3:39:13] <%CommanderSqueaks> Monsters were hungry
[3:39:15] <Prevot> punies are food
[3:39:18] <StarMechV> "their" means the monsters after the punis
[3:39:19] <shiny_prinny> "their" refers to the monsters
[3:39:30] <CrematedCube> Discursive analysis is hard sometimes
[3:39:33] <+jiggy_snipe> their = the monsters
[3:39:33] <+zooeymainbtw> ye
[3:39:33] <%kyh9> It's not 100% clear, to be fair
[3:39:36] <%nxflre> very careful yeah
[3:39:36] <Prevot> jesus woolie not this again
[3:39:36] <Drusain> the lore for twlight is that the boo heroine was the chest in the town
[3:39:38] <+jiggy_snipe> that's not clear tbf
[3:39:38] <Nomad94> Ambiguous syntax
[3:39:39] <+zooeymainbtw> very true reggie
[3:39:43] <shiny_prinny> true
[3:39:45] <%kyh9> PUNIES HUNGER
[3:39:48] <+zooeymainbtw> though i prefer the dark lore
[3:39:48] <%Proxzo> yeah, localization
[3:39:50] <%kyh9> I like your versions first
[3:39:50] <%sparkly_yoyo> Woolie Ghouling the Punies
[3:39:51] <Sol_Install> yea
[3:39:51] <%LastHazzerd> language is hard!
[3:39:52] <%CommanderSqueaks> The writing is ambiguous.
[3:39:53] <%nxflre> yeah pretty fair
[3:39:54] <%TheRisingPride> Oh, this is one of those "Lets eat grandma" situations
[3:39:55] <+jiggy_snipe> that's why you don't use a pronoun there
[3:39:55] <Prevot> it's that potion making shit all over again
[3:39:55] <%Euphbugg> fair
[3:39:55] <%kyh9> I like Woolie's version more
[3:39:56] <Nomad94> Japanese would not have this problem
[3:39:57] <StarMechV> HOW DOES ONE ENGLISH
[3:40:00] <+DeRedBaron> yeah like at first i was like "oh..." but then rereading it i was like OH yeah that was a little tricky cus you can forget it
[3:40:01] <Darren716> Idk this was pretty easy with context clues
[3:40:04] <SoratheWonderful> Grammar lessons~
[3:40:08] <+zooeymainbtw> you good woolie
[3:40:10] <%LastHazzerd> doesn't help that the monsters were on the previous page
[3:40:11] <CrematedCube> I'm constantly minding my use of 'it' to avoid confusion
[3:40:30] <mugglus> "pronouns suck"-Elon Musk
[3:40:50] <%sparkly_yoyo> what a dick
[3:40:55] <Drusain> yes
[3:40:58] <cosmicgoatee> my pronouns are monstar/monstars
[3:40:58] <%ringabal> He was nice
[3:40:58] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:40:58] <Papa_Bearman> That sounds like a fucking nightmare.
[3:40:59] <SoratheWonderful> Koopa boat
[3:41:09] <%CommanderSqueaks> Remember Cortez didn't give a FUCK about the star. He just gave it to you.
[3:41:13] <shiny_prinny> if Cortez was a little more observant, he could have been a major villain
[3:41:32] <%DukeBlack_> eat it
[3:41:34] <Nomad94> make it a Champion belt, perhaps?
[3:41:37] <%Proxzo> They didnt know they were cursed
[3:41:39] <noe_juan_kanobe> How does thing guy know all this stuff?
[3:41:40] <%BisoromiBear> prison pocket
[3:41:43] <@akuda_bar> part of the trap is they didn't know
[3:41:45] <%Proxzo> but this guy knew?
[3:41:47] <Prevot> wait what
[3:41:51] <Prevot> they knew?
[3:41:53] <@akuda_bar> Or that. who knows
[3:41:57] <%kyh9> the painting yoooo
[3:42:04] <%fly2555_of_the_rebellion> they didnt know
[3:42:09] <%psidefx> Don't ask how they know
[3:42:11] <SoratheWonderful> Jumpman Toad
[3:42:15] <%kyh9> Poshley's dad
[3:42:18] <StarMechV> THE MOOOON
[3:42:19] <CrematedCube> Maybe he heard about what happened to the others
[3:42:20] <@akuda_bar> If you don't know... Now you know
[3:42:25] <%Euphbugg> That could be the one that the X-nauts have as well
[3:42:32] <Blunder_Blue> So there might be one or two more stories but they got the big reveal and that's all that matters.
[3:42:34] <Daniel_Is_I> Like an onion, as was the style at the time
[3:42:35] <noe_juan_kanobe> Toad was the last one.
[3:42:39] <+zooeymainbtw> great lore
[3:42:40] <SixthSun2> Grubba had the best idea
[3:42:41] <+DeRedBaron> remember the one on the moon wasn't there originally, it was in rouge port cus the x-nauts got it before the start of the game
[3:42:43] <sunnythedrunk> That would be a pretty good idea bruuuther
[3:42:53] <Drusain> Who would've thought the chests had lore
[3:42:58] <Papa_Bearman> Love how it's dark in Woolie and Reggie's room.
[3:43:03] <Papa_Bearman> Can't see 'em.
[3:43:06] <%fly2555_of_the_rebellion> chapters
