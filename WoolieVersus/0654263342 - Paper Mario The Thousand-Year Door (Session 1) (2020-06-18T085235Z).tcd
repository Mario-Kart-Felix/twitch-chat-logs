[0:17:30] <%doomerskeletor13> The game is fairly straight forward
[0:17:33] <%DatAsuna> They won't let this become another gamegrumps
[0:17:33] <%mishtershmee> Advice: don't die.
[0:17:35] <TundraOW> There's cheese builds but this game isn't hard so just vibe
[0:17:35] <jellssssss20> Could I get a clip link please
[0:17:37] <Arbeh> I remember the wrestling section selling me on tournament arcs for life

[0:17:41] <thesickestzak> psaWrong
[0:17:41] <%wolfofsound> alright time to give advice without having played the game LUL
[0:17:42] <rubbishbinge> The Admiral <3
[0:17:43] <WakeUpThrow> Ohh, excited for this one!
[0:17:43] <%CommanderSqueaks> @DatAsuna Ooof, that one was rough.
[0:17:45] <+Dimfish> the universe will smother you with energy
[0:17:46] <marvel877> Its straightforward, BUT you do have a habit of overthinking things, especially in rpgs, so...
[0:17:47] <%SmoothEnigma> I cant WAIT for people to scream during chapter 3
[0:17:48] <Lee_The_Limey> Pick a safe word when you're lost
[0:17:49] <@Menitta> To be fair it is still a Mario game so it's not gonna be too easy to fuck up
[0:17:50] <Solidnick18> it's pretty straight forward
[0:17:51] <+Audega> It's relatively straight forward.
[0:17:51] <%RadicalWeegee> I played this so much as a child and as an adult , shits amaziing If you have a guid itll be alright!
[0:17:52] <@akuda_bar> @WoolieVersus you literally can't miss anything so no hurt feelings if you bypass something by accident
[0:17:53] <prime_name> Advice: Peach is great
[0:18:05] <Kiryurules> Yeyeyeye Paper Mario
[0:18:08] <Papa_Bearman> All I'll say is: Don't try to brute-force the same strategy throughout the whole game. Remember to change things up. Don't be a Grump.
[0:18:09] <Nomad94> Paper Mario is just great
[0:18:10] <INDECISIVEjew> @WoolieVersus If you walk by a collectible hidden in the background, do you want it called out? There's a lot in this game
[0:18:10] <%RichochetForce> Yes
[0:18:11] <%Th3SmartAlec> Medium RPG, yeah
[0:18:12] <Glaicus> Yeah this game isn't too long.
[0:18:17] <AkumaMatataX_X> im surprised that your not playing the first game
[0:18:19] <Solidnick18> it's in the middle
[0:18:19] <MonsterEnvy> Yeah
[0:18:21] <%RadicalWeegee> Sounds about right
[0:18:21] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Not for you is not Lu
[0:18:21] <%Lion_kun> Advice: Do not do Pit of 100 trials
[0:18:22] <+CelioHogane> It isn't that short, tho
[0:18:22] <Torenticus> 30 sounds right yea
[0:18:23] <@akuda_bar> @INDECISIVEjew there's one on every screen, so no, probably best to not
[0:18:23] <@Menitta> There is one thing that he could mis
[0:18:24] <thesickestzak> Don't forget the smokin sick style meter in the battle system :)
[0:18:26] <%doomerskeletor13> Yeah
[0:18:26] <Darren716> Yeah you arent gonna be hitting Kotor lengths
[0:18:29] <+Dimfish> yeah 40 hours blind is realistic
[0:18:31] <thelovingfool> depending how well you know the game, yes
[0:18:35] <marvel877> 40 hours just about.
[0:18:36] <Nomad94> @Menitta final chapter, THAT chest?
[0:18:36] <+Itsandrewbaby> i have never played this game but ill tell you what to do every step of the way
[0:18:38] <+teh_rawk> not a lot need for grinding
[0:18:40] <Fanciful_Unicorn> The Game Grumps took 30 years to finish it
[0:18:43] <jellssssss20> Thank you @irridium
[0:18:44] <+masked_hero_lucky> Just don't run from fights and you shouldn't need to grind
[0:18:45] <+CaptainPyron> @WoolieVersus All I can say is keep an eye out for side quests. Worth doing them.
[0:18:45] <+theoriginalbigboy3535> Why the fuck is woolly playing this game
[0:18:48] <Lee_The_Limey> World record 0 death speedrun Kappa
[0:18:49] <@Menitta> No, the thing with that one partner
[0:18:53] <Nomad94> hmmm
[0:18:55] <Mczutioni> @thesickestzak oh fuck i forgot about that
[0:18:57] <%Ancopro> thankfully the game doesn't really need any grinding for an rpg
[0:18:57] <fairore> @theoriginalbigboy3535 why not
[0:18:58] <marvel877> @Fanciful_Unicorn they finished?
[0:18:58] <Papa_Bearman> @Fanciful_Unicorn Yeah, but the Game Grumps aren't that good.
[0:19:00] <+Dimfish> why wouldnt he its great
[0:19:00] <%infinite_rotation> @woolieversus currently working on the second draft of my fantasy novel, what are some of tropes that you hate in fiction?
[0:19:04] <%DatAsuna> Doubtful
[0:19:10] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @theoriginalbigboy3535 Sometimes u need sum Mario wholness ya know?
[0:19:11] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:19:16] <+theoriginalbigboy3535> @fairore it just doesn't seem like his type of game
[0:19:16] <Darren716> Once you get into it you can probably do a chapter a session
[0:19:17] <Griff_the_Mystic> What I love about this game is that there's no wrong build really, but BP build is my favorite
[0:19:18] <%Th3SmartAlec> Not until Chapter _
[0:19:22] <%doomerskeletor13> That’s definitely achievable
[0:19:22] <%FuqBoiSlim> @fanciful_unicorn I dont know if we should use game grumps as a metric of video game prowess tbh...
[0:19:25] <$BallerSwagBro9k> MARAKOV LUL
[0:19:27] <%LoVezineTheAir> LoVezineTheAir subscribed with Twitch Prime.
[0:19:32] <Rei_Dsoto> Shout Out to the Woolie!
[0:19:33] <MrBorisMakarov> dammit atpRtsd
[0:19:36] <+theoriginalbigboy3535> @WoolieVersus If you end up liking it, Bug Fables is pretty good new indie game in the same vein
[0:19:37] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> Ryota Kawade's best paper mario
[0:19:37] <@akuda_bar> terminally capricious is a good name lol
[0:19:39] <thelovingfool> @woolieversus try not to grind, just fight enemies as they come. overleveling can soft lock you
[0:19:39] <INDECISIVEjew> I'd guess at least 8 or 9 sessions
[0:19:42] <%a_goth_pancake> pointing to the stands with the EP count
[0:19:42] <@Menitta> theres at least ONE side quest he needs to do and people will remind him when he can
[0:19:46] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL LUL LUL
[0:19:52] <TundraOW> HOT take
[0:19:57] <+Shotgundam009> Yooo
[0:19:58] <@akuda_bar> w r o n g
[0:19:58] <+CelioHogane> VOLCANO take
[0:19:58] <+Dimfish> controversial
[0:20:00] <Mczutioni> HOT take, also wrong
[0:20:01] <Darren716> Super is the best, fight me cowards
[0:20:01] <time_axis> I mean 64 is good, but I wouldn't say "better"
[0:20:02] <+marumariball> wrong take but its ok
[0:20:02] <+KilogramHours> BUG FABLES IS BETTER
[0:20:04] <+Beniial> How about playing Sticker Star after this, in case you enjoy it too much
[0:20:05] <+Itsandrewbaby> we dont claim him
[0:20:05] <$BallerSwagBro9k> HERESY
[0:20:05] <+Parrish_broadnax> we throwin shot
[0:20:05] <%CommanderSqueaks> How can one person be so wrong
[0:20:06] <Louie_Salmon> Definitely hard agree
[0:20:07] <+Audega> They're both pretty good, but no lol
[0:20:07] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> 1 2 and 3 are ALL great
[0:20:07] <%LuckyLagomorph> Got a friend who thinks the same way. I think he's wrong
[0:20:08] <jjcrow21> wrong
[0:20:08] <+worldbrand> those people dont rememer the back half of the game
[0:20:11] <SoromopsEX> Super Paper Mario THE GOAT
[0:20:11] <Fanciful_Unicorn> @fairore pretty sure they did @FuqBoiSlim I absolutely use them as a metric, the low end of the metric, because they suck at games
[0:20:12] <@Menitta> Its not popular but it's not a bad take
[0:20:12] <dinnydanny777> What was the paper Legend of Zelda called
[0:20:13] <%Th3SmartAlec> You know it's shitty when you call your paper game a "Sticker"
[0:20:13] <%Ancopro> the original is good but this one is just that game but better
[0:20:14] <+masked_hero_lucky> That's crazy, TTYD is the best one easy
[0:20:14] <%doomerskeletor13> They’re both really good
[0:20:15] <%wolfofsound> I respect a man who is confidently wrong LUL
[0:20:15] <+KilogramHours> @WoolieVersus Have you seen Bug Fables?
[0:20:18] <GamecubesGiganticAButton> This game has higher highs and lower lows than 64 imo
[0:20:18] <+CelioHogane> @KilogramHours ehhh... it's different thematic
[0:20:19] <WaifusSansFrontieres> as long as we agree that SPM has the best writing
[0:20:21] <glass_marcus> 64 is paced a little better, but the combat is more refined in ttyd
[0:20:21] <rubbishbinge> sticker star is so good
[0:20:23] <Nyerp> it is kinda weird to start with ttyd tho
[0:20:24] <rubbishbinge> jk
[0:20:24] <+theoriginalbigboy3535> Bug Fables is not better. It does nothing with the paper aesthetic besides having it
[0:20:25] <%Th3SmartAlec> ?
[0:20:25] <%DatAsuna> That's a cpital I, not an L
[0:20:28] <thesickestzak> Hey man. It if fine to be wrong. Kappa
[0:20:32] <a_mad_dragon> door was okay, but colour splash made me want to play sticker star again
[0:20:37] <+KilogramHours> @theoriginalbigboy3535 The gameplay is significantly better.
[0:20:39] <%FuqBoiSlim> @fanciful_unicorn you got me there
[0:20:40] <petwisk> Bowser Inside Story Is better
[0:20:43] <Torenticus> i think you could argue either 64 or ttyd is better, both are great
[0:20:45] <%doomerskeletor13> woolieSMUG
[0:20:58] <@Menitta> Mario and Luigi games have their own flavor
[0:20:59] <%FuqBoiSlim> @petwisk based
[0:20:59] <fairore> @fanciful_unicorn wait why am I mentioned
[0:21:01] <%DatAsuna> Yeah it's weird
[0:21:03] <%a_goth_pancake> woolie I want you to know you missed demon invasions by not updating doom.
[0:21:05] <+tearfuldevil> yeah i hate mmo gameplay but the starfighte rmdoe in swotor is okay
[0:21:15] <spidervenomized> never played any of the paper mario

[0:21:21] <FacetiousAF> big things at a medium pace
[0:21:21] <Glaicus> Chapter 3 and Chapter 6
[0:21:22] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Chapter 3 is always the best chapter in Paper Mario. Always
[0:21:23] <+KilogramHours> @WoolieVersus Have you ever heard of Bug Fables? It is basically the a spiritual successor to TTYD thats very good.
[0:21:23] <%doomerskeletor13> breebuPog
[0:21:23] <rubbishbinge> GET RAWKED
[0:21:25] <+masked_hero_lucky> Just a chapter we're sure you're going to like

[0:21:31] <%doomerskeletor13> Chapter 3 is gonna be hype
[0:21:32] <+teh_rawk> YOU READY TO GET RAWKED
[0:21:32] <+theoriginalbigboy3535> @KilogramHours I mean, three total characters made the game feel solved, while you could at least dick around with the new characters each chapter in TTYD
[0:21:33] <Papa_Bearman> GET READY TO FEEL THE RAWK
[0:21:45] <%bread_assassin> Can we not do the whole "Boy, I can't wait until Woolie gets to THIS PART!'?

[0:21:46] <%a_goth_pancake> it begin
[0:21:49] <INDECISIVEjew> Yeah I went to 64 after TTYD, and found it pretty sterile in comparison. Still miles better than anything after Super though

[0:22:07] <%wolfofsound> @bread_assassin nah get those expectations way up there
[0:22:09] <time_axis> The thing about SWTOR is that I would describe it as "painless" rather than "fun".
[0:22:10] <+Dimfish> super is fine but ttyd is god tier
[0:22:19] <Papa_Bearman> Reggie leaves, stream freezes.
[0:22:26] <@akuda_bar> i'm worried he's got the settings on dolphin wrong
[0:22:26] <@akuda_bar> but
[0:22:28] <@akuda_bar> we'll see
[0:22:29] <afronooch> ttyd is easily one of my top 10 of all time
[0:22:36] <@akuda_bar> ttyd is actually a little finnicky for emulation
[0:22:38] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @sylphyyyy

[1:33:49] <Ner234> Downloaded
[1:33:49] <+AsinPersuasion> 3F is a year and a half
[1:33:49] <JetpackMcQuack> This game isn't ready for what's about to happen
[1:33:52] <+AsinPersuasion> not even close
[1:33:53] <%Ancopro> do they not teach you style yet?
[1:33:55] <Magoloso> Woolz trained for TTYD by playing fighting games
[1:34:00] <Megafang2145> but it's incredibly difficult
[1:34:00] <%Theycallmenerf> woolieS
[1:34:05] <%Theycallmenerf> woolieF
[1:34:11] <+pectusumbra> So has Woolie played the original paper mario then?
[1:34:13] <+masked_hero_lucky> Fun mechanics right? Shame WE NEVER SAW THEM AGAIN
[1:34:17] <GenericSoda> we in the lab now
[1:34:18] <Naho_Saenoki> @pectusumbra No.
[1:34:20] <@akuda_bar> @pectusumbra nope
[1:34:20] <%kyh9> @pectusumbra nope, actually
[1:34:21] <+AsinPersuasion> lemme see those third strike parries
[1:34:23] <+pectusumbra> got ya
[1:34:31] <+pectusumbra> A rare case, but not a deal breaker
[1:34:32] <%kyh9> This is actually the best tutorial
[1:34:33] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> There is STYLE too
[1:34:33] <An_Armed_Bear> Well we saw them again, just not from Paper Mario
[1:34:33] <%Ancopro> woolie press a right after you hammer
[1:34:35] <UnlimitedBick> Press A in the middle of the bounce
[1:34:37] <%Javaa01> You can do 3 jumps in a row
[1:34:44] <%Javaa01> If you keep your timing up
[1:34:45] <Solidnick18> you can keep doing it to
[1:34:45] <thesickestzak> I don't think there is actually ever a tutorial for Stylish Moves
[1:34:47] <%LuckyLagomorph> I forget, does this game teach you about the style mechanic?
[1:34:48] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> Dargging!
[1:34:49] <+Parrish_broadnax> he'll be here for hours
[1:34:50] <Magoloso> 3 jumps in a row Woolz, for now
[1:34:50] <tkuwari> do sick flips
[1:34:53] <Papa_Bearman> @Javaa01 That's not true.
[1:34:54] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> Dragging just a hair
[1:34:55] <critiquequartz> @woolieversus press A when the hammer lands for style
[1:34:56] <pixel_river> we training room
[1:34:57] <phatmac16> WE LABBING NOW
[1:34:58] <Darren716> Woolies gonna go for super guard every time and eat so much damage
[1:34:58] <+Parrish_broadnax> this is the rest of the stream WE LABBIN
[1:34:58] <A_Classy_Gentleman> @Javaa01 That's only with multibounce.
[1:34:59] <+Powerpinch> Press A at the peak of a bounce for a STYLISH jump
[1:35:02] <tttruest> there's an NPC that tells you about Stylish
[1:35:03] <Prevot> Get Into Paper Mario
[1:35:07] <%gatorafan> Paper Mario lab session go!
[1:35:07] <+AsinPersuasion> @WoolieVersus you can chain jump
[1:35:08] <Davybot> oh my god labbing paper mario
[1:35:09] <Nomad94> I beat this game never learning about Style
[1:35:12] <UnlimitedBick> @thesickestzak COMPLETELY hidden mechanic
[1:35:12] <+masked_hero_lucky> Woolie, do a hammer and try hitting A as soon as the hammer hits the ground
[1:35:16] <@akuda_bar> regardless of where the enemy is, the timing will be the same, even if they appear to be close or far away
[1:35:17] <%Th3SmartAlec> Press A mid bounce after first jump
[1:35:19] <NotHereToStream> isn't it a badge that you need to chain jumps together or something
[1:35:21] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> Rushing
[1:35:23] <tttruest> @UnlimitedBick a npc tells you about it
[1:35:23] <+agumon9000> @WoolieVersus When you do the jump press A at the peak of marios jump
[1:35:29] <%Cerephesis> Cerephesis is continuing the Gift Sub they got from topendbuzza!
[1:35:31] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> 8 frames vs 3 frames
[1:35:31] <A_Classy_Gentleman> NOT MY TEMPO!
[1:35:36] <%Javaa01> Oh right, you get the full string with the Mario & Luigi games starting out
[1:35:36] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Under my policies, all Americans have the right to time in the lab
[1:35:39] <%Ancopro> i think you learn style once you get a crystal star, cause the mechanic is tyed to that
[1:35:40] <+Slattsquatch> Poor Goombella being a punching bag
[1:35:42] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> rushing again
[1:35:45] <+Audega> YEYEYE
[1:35:48] <@akuda_bar> yeyeyeyye
[1:35:48] <chococake420> @A_Classy_Gentleman multibounce is jumping on multiple enemies there's another badge called power bounce that makes it so that you can jump 3+ times
[1:35:48] <A_Classy_Gentleman> SYTLE
[1:35:49] <@akuda_bar> STYLIN
[1:35:49] <Papa_Bearman> Try going to Tactics and selecting "Do Nothing."
[1:35:51] <+KilogramHours> Stylin
[1:35:51] <TeethMuncher> we got secret moves
[1:35:52] <+KilogramHours> STYLIN
[1:35:59] <thesickestzak> @unlimitedbick I remember only learning about from message boards back in the day
[1:35:59] <dinnydanny777> We're just bullying Goombelle
[1:36:00] <@akuda_bar> SSSTYLE
[1:36:01] <+Slattsquatch> I think that only place that tells you about style is a random NPC underground
[1:36:02] <TheLemuroid> You'll get the parry timing eventually
[1:36:04] <GenericSoda> 3 hours later
[1:36:04] <BreakersAweigh> does it work in tutorial?
[1:36:05] <%Th3SmartAlec> NO SPEND THE TIME
[1:36:09] <A_Classy_Gentleman> @chococake420 I literally can never remember which is which fifiH

[1:36:32] <JaydenC64> style woolie
[1:36:32] <DeadNinja1> I never used B, didn't seem worth the failure rate.
[1:36:32] <stormhawk9891> @WoolieVersus When using hammer, press A just as the hammer hits the enemy
[1:36:33] <+BestTeaMaker> there's no styles yet cause he hasn't learned appeals
[1:36:33] <%Ancopro> you'll prob learn it later might be too early
[1:36:36] <+Hawk_Rush> Styling may be done later
[1:36:38] <tkuwari> No style meter?
[1:36:38] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1272752298469609473?s=20

[1:57:29] <+Bailey__gaming> Mimic-Kun
[1:57:32] <InXplotch> and I guess dolphin if you believe in being a degenerate, but it requires motion controls
[1:57:32] <@akuda_bar> are you a bad enough dude
[1:57:33] <Potatoidea> @AsinPersuasion Technically there's emus you can hook wiimotes up to
[1:57:35] <%kyh9> this game is BURSTING with charm and personality
[1:57:37] <rubbishbinge> just end the adventure here
[1:57:37] <%psidefx> kyaa
[1:57:38] <Cdjgamer> the box only opens for 4.99
[1:57:41] <Vashido22> fuck mimics
[1:57:42] <nothuzad> mimics are a much older concept
[1:57:42] <Solidnick18> get dat key
[1:57:42] <CastellanVon> Oh shit
[1:57:42] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:57:43] <%kyh9> The localization on this is peak
[1:57:44] <+Grayhammatter> this game is so good
[1:57:45] <rubbishbinge> u_u
[1:57:46] <%Th3SmartAlec> Kappa
[1:57:48] <Vashido22> ALWAYS hit the chest
[1:57:51] <InXplotch> it requires pointing at the screen so it's a pain
[1:57:55] <CastellanVon> I fucking loved this game
[1:57:55] <ballpoint_ren> The GALL that Woolie would think there's a mimic in this game
[1:57:56] <%Th3SmartAlec> Nice
[1:58:00] <Potatoidea> No
[1:58:05] <+Juriasu> where have I seen that key before
[1:58:06] <InXplotch> they come back eventually
[1:58:08] <AthenaAegis> Mimic-Kun Kappa
[1:58:10] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> I think it's like 2 or 3 rooms
[1:58:11] <superlit_1> until area reload
[1:58:12] <Torenticus> i think its 2 screens away?
[1:58:12] <+skizzuto> gotta get at least two screens away for enemies to respawn
[1:58:12] <%Th3SmartAlec> I think some enemies do
[1:58:13] <marvel877> they come back
[1:58:14] <nobody287> you cannot grind in this game
[1:58:14] <+marumariball> until you reload the area
[1:58:15] <straycatrock> they come back a few rooms away
[1:58:16] <+kngkoopa> i think its 3 screens
[1:58:16] <SixthSun2> Gotta leave the zone to respawn
[1:58:17] <%The_Timo> No you can't
[1:58:17] <Potatoidea> They come back when the area is left
[1:58:19] <Jojoludens> they come back after a few rooms
[1:58:19] <+magiclottie> enemies respawn every 2-3 rooms
[1:58:20] <+KilogramHours> @WoolieVersus I think they respawn after like 4 rooms or so?
[1:58:20] <InXplotch> @WoolieVersus they come back, but you have to travel further
[1:58:20] <StarMechV> enemeis respawn after a while
[1:58:21] <MonsterEnvy> I think they respawn eventually.
[1:58:21] <Magoloso> On area reload
[1:58:21] <CastellanVon> You don’t need to grind anyway
[1:58:22] <frigglefroogle> pipes reload the area
[1:58:23] <The_Maddness> @WoolieVersus Enemies DO respawn, eventually
[1:58:25] <cochramd1992> imagine learning about mimics from Dark Souls and not from your dungeon master, this post brought to you by the D&D game
[1:58:26] <%Irridium> can you slaughter everyone in the kingdom
[1:58:27] <%GeneralSCPatton> Grinding is possible. Must move further away to respawn.
[1:58:27] <Davybot> here we go
[1:58:28] <Chimeraelite> You can 100% grind in this game
[1:58:29] <%The_Timo> Has to be a hard load transition
[1:58:29] <cochramd1992> *gang
[1:58:31] <TheLemuroid> Gotta leave the zone
[1:58:31] <+AsinPersuasion> you can absolutely grind
[1:58:34] <+AsinPersuasion> max level is 99
[1:58:34] <+Pippinitus> You have to go to a new environment for enemies to respawn iirc
[1:58:36] <kulmoth> They come back you need to go further away
[1:58:37] <chococake420> you can use a usb sensor bar plus bluetooth + wii mote (i think all wiimotes are bluetooth) and an emu and a disk
[1:58:37] <tkuwari> shes flying
[1:58:38] <+Grayhammatter> enemies are reloaded by reloading the area
[1:58:40] <+ToastyMozart> They come back, but it has pretty strong anti-grinding tech.
[1:58:41] <Vashido22> WOAH
[1:58:42] <%Ancopro> WoAAAA
[1:58:43] <+masked_hero_lucky> Idk, if you're emulating the timing might be a little weird

[1:58:46] <Vashido22> woaaAAAHH

[1:58:47] <+BeastPrison> they do come back
[1:58:48] <InXplotch> WoAAaa
[1:58:50] <StuffHunter> Yeah, it takes a few rooms or a zone, but enemies do return.
[1:58:50] <GenericSoda> WHOAWHOAWHOAWHOA
[1:58:50] <nobody287> enemies do respawn but eventually you get no exp from them

[2:04:47] <$BallerSwagBro9k> WOOLIE NOOOOOOO
[2:04:47] <Torenticus> p3 door is just sadness
[2:04:47] <+jiggy_snipe> then he knows whats up
[2:04:48] <+skizzuto> he didn't watch it because he's read the manga already
[2:04:48] <%FuqBoiSlim> YOU HAVENT SEEN DEATH NOTE BROTHERHOOD????
[2:04:49] <Magoloso> Brotherhood is an EXCELLENT anime
[2:04:49] <CookieCutter007> don't spoil the door
[2:04:50] <%baronblank> if you liked original FMA I'm sure you'd like brotherhood
[2:04:51] <The_Maddness> Only GOOD things come out of the door in FMA!
[2:04:52] <stormhawk9891> The goodest door
[2:04:52] <%Livelinne> psaJpeg
[2:04:53] <nothuzad> original FMA anime is mostly pretty good still but I think Brotherhood has a much better climax and end
[2:04:54] <Megafang2145> you really get to know that door
[2:04:56] <haitakaa> WHAT
[2:04:57] <+Juriasu> the door is even cooler in brotherhood
[2:04:57] <tkuwari> This is a pretty good door
[2:05:00] <muniea3> watch it boomer
[2:05:02] <%Th3SmartAlec> I'm guessing the stairs
[2:05:03] <$BallerSwagBro9k> BETRAYAL
[2:05:03] <+SvenHolgersson> The original FMA had such a TERRIBLE ending
[2:05:05] <%RadicalWeegee> OMG WOOLIE STOP , GO WATCH BROTHER HOOD xDD
[2:05:07] <%SuperKirby24> YOu HaVeNt WaTcHeD BROTHERHOOD?!?!?!
[2:05:09] <YakumoYomi> Brotherhood assumes you already know the franchise, so kinda compresses the beginning
[2:05:10] <%DatAsuna> It's okay
[2:05:13] <+AsinPersuasion> is woolie going to do the super boss?
[2:05:14] <+paladinstarbuster> SO WERE WE
[2:05:15] <haitakaa> fma original is so bad
[2:05:17] <Darren716> Woolie chat will scream if youre missing something
[2:05:18] <rubbishbinge> read the magma
[2:05:21] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> ye
[2:05:22] <reonome> oh ok thats fine then
[2:05:23] <@Menitta> fuckin weebs
[2:05:26] <+SvenHolgersson> And they ruined the homumculus full stop
[2:05:26] <Magoloso> Oh then you know
[2:05:28] <%Th3SmartAlec> I'm shocked there was nothing
[2:05:30] <rubbishbinge> ok thats fine then
[2:05:30] <cheesedburgers> Boomer
[2:05:31] <CrmznOgre> u good then
[2:05:32] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @phatmac16
[2:05:33] <+tearfuldevil> if you read the manga then you're fine
[2:05:33] <samuraicaveman> reading the manga is like watching Brotherhood
[2:05:34] <Ultimatefool> Woolie is a WEEABOOMER
[2:05:34] <%FallenAngelZelos> I really dislike how everyone hates on the original anime after brotherhood came out.
[2:05:35] <Archmortal> start on like episode 13 if you wanna save some time
[2:05:36] <%RadicalWeegee> Grandpa otaku Woolie over here
[2:05:39] <Junkles> I like how fma original starts better, but it becomes nonsense
[2:05:40] <TheLemuroid> If you read it you are good
[2:05:41] <+Someitalian123> if you read the manga you should be good
[2:05:42] <+jiggy_snipe> you read the manga, you know the story
[2:05:43] <+Dimfish> thats fair
[2:05:48] <CookieCutter007> CLANG
[2:05:49] <+KilogramHours> BUT IT WAS GOOD
[2:05:50] <Kaji04> Optimal experience is first half of FMA and then Brotherhood
[2:05:52] <Magoloso> If you read the manga, then you know how good it is
[2:05:52] <%Th3SmartAlec> C L A N G
[2:05:53] <MonsterEnvy> agreed
[2:05:53] <phatmac16> You good woolie
[2:05:56] <TheGershon> it was it's own thing
[2:05:56] <+tearfuldevil> @FallenAngelZelos i really dislike the original ending, so Kappa
[2:06:01] <Prevot> people who can't let the original FMA go are the worst
[2:06:01] <T_Sasquatch> FMA ResidentSleeper
[2:06:01] <+SvenHolgersson> Their changes were TERRIBLE when you learn what they chnaged
[2:06:03] <+paladinstarbuster> It wasnt faithfull towards the end at all woolie
[2:06:04] <MyNameIsRasus> You've read it, you're fine
[2:06:04] <Spadechronicles> @fallenangelzelos Agreed
[2:06:05] <%DatAsuna> Better in some ways but not every
[2:06:05] <%baronblank> yea I guess if you've seen the manga it's the same thing as far as I'm aware
[2:06:06] <rubbishbinge> now for shaman king
[2:06:08] <%Livelinne> The Manga elites lucidPride
[2:06:11] <TeethMuncher> It was good until they ended up in Nazi Germany
[2:06:11] <+Estuko> They're both good, I liked both of them tbh but Brotherhood is exceptional lol
[2:06:12] <%Sol_Install> yep
[2:06:13] <haitakaa> right after hunter x hunter
[2:06:14] <%GeneralSCPatton> Not faithful? The story is COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
[2:06:14] <+SvenHolgersson> OH SHIT RIGHT
[2:06:14] <reonome> remember conquerer of shambala LUL
[2:06:15] <phatmac16> Original fma was alright
[2:06:20] <Archmortal> FUCK Berserk 2016
[2:06:21] <%Klefth> Anticontent LUL
[2:06:23] <+D4C_Trice> CLANG
[2:06:25] <+Zenryoku21> when you realize what they changed, Brotherhood kills og anime
[2:06:28] <+SvenHolgersson> You hyped for Shaman King @WoolieVersus
[2:06:29] <%FallenAngelZelos> the movies were fiiiiiiiine
[2:06:31] <%Jonny_Uppercut> It's like watching Hellsing vs Hellsing Ultimate. The later one just nulls the existence of the older one
[2:06:32] <zocano> I prefer the original but Brotherhood has a lot of different highs, I like what they do with the original's ending(plus movie) more
[2:06:32] <+OUTheTeam> lmao it's legit the worst
[2:06:36] <+tearfuldevil> original fma is fine but past halfway its not faithful at all
[2:06:36] <+ToastyMozart> FMA did kind of it's own interesting thing thematically while Brohood is more rote adaptation.
[2:06:36] <TheGershon> even back in the day I thought the 2003 ending was lame as hell
[2:06:36] <phatmac16> Anyway
[2:06:37] <%DappercatEsquire> FMA Brotherhood is the OG attack and dethrone god
[2:06:39] <Magoloso> I think original FMA is decent, but Brotherhood is top tier
[2:06:39] <CrmznOgre> oh actually i need to know is the golden age arc the 1st arc ?
[2:06:40] <%Ancopro> erm
[2:06:41] <%Th3SmartAlec> SUMMON LUCIFER
[2:06:41] <%Atomik456> original fma was pretty good but it did Rose dirty for shitty edge value
[2:06:41] <MyNameIsRasus> EQUIVALENTE EXCHANGE
[2:06:41] <$BallerSwagBro9k> But old anime cant be good because bad graphics, like video games Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa
[2:06:42] <%Sol_Install> I need to replay this game again

[2:45:29] <%kyh9> Sometimes two
[2:45:29] <Darren716> Some cost more
[2:45:30] <MonsterEnvy> It depends
[2:45:30] <+Zenryoku21> varies
[2:45:31] <harlekuin966> many slots
[2:45:31] <%Ancopro> pierce defence really good
[2:45:31] <%kyh9> Different amounts
[2:45:31] <+TombstoneTTromboners> 1-3
[2:45:32] <@Menitta> Im a fan of Piercing blow
[2:45:32] <InXplotch> they can cost more than 1
[2:45:33] <+skizzuto> they can cost more
[2:45:33] <TeethMuncher> depends
[2:45:33] <Magoloso> they vary
[2:45:33] <+TombstoneTTromboners> usually
[2:45:34] <+KilogramHours> sometimes 2 or 3
[2:45:34] <Megafang2145> They can cost up to 8
[2:45:34] <The_Maddness> Theres no slots, they cost points
[2:45:34] <missingangle> no, they can cost more.
[2:45:35] <%DatAsuna> Badges cost points, not slots
[2:45:35] <ChatNinja> Wildly varies
[2:45:36] <Jojoludens> some cost more BUT you can get more slots on level up
[2:45:36] <shiny_prinny> they vary
[2:45:36] <+pectusumbra> different amounts of BP depending on how good they are
[2:45:37] <+Grayhammatter> they tell you how many they take
[2:45:38] <Papa_Bearman> You'll be asked to confirm.
[2:45:38] <GenericSoda> piercingblow is absolutely worht it
[2:45:41] <chococake420> it can go up to 7 i believe
[2:45:42] <+Slattsquatch> PIERCING BLOW
[2:45:43] <tttruest> some cost like 6
[2:45:44] <Megafang2145> 0-8 BP
[2:45:47] <Papa_Bearman> You'll be told and asked to confirm.
[2:45:48] <Darren716> Get the super jump
[2:45:48] <bevyrage> some can cost up to 4, though commonly will only be 1-3
[2:45:50] <+skizzuto> some badges can cost upwards of like 6 or more
[2:45:50] <DeadNinja1> Jump or hammer for sure.
[2:45:51] <Jojoludens> it tells you when you buy em
[2:45:52] <%SouLucha> Pierce is also pretty good.
[2:45:53] <+cdrom321> I think you can select one to find out BP cost.
[2:45:53] <%DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus Badges use a point system
[2:45:55] <DragonArt07> @WoolieVersus since your playing rpg any thoughts of doing playthrough. since it's co-op reggie can take part in it
[2:45:56] <%The_Timo> Defense pierce is good as Defense is a set damage reduction
[2:45:59] <%Ancopro> thats supper good
[2:46:00] <InXplotch> piercing blow isn't that good early is it?
[2:46:01] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> it takes 1
[2:46:09] <InXplotch> its better later on
[2:46:11] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> psaUp psaUp psaUp psaUp psaUp psaUp psaUp psaUp
[2:46:14] <The_Maddness> @WoolieVersus there are no Badge slots, they just cost points to equip
[2:46:16] <%Ancopro> the next area intoduces koopas that have defense
[2:46:17] <Papa_Bearman> You can press right on the D-pad to access the Badge screen immediately.
[2:46:17] <HolisticField> who cares, its a kids game he'll be fine
[2:46:17] <+Grayhammatter> we are hammerman now
[2:46:22] <Megafang2145> @InXplotch it's good for the quiz fight i guess
[2:46:26] <InXplotch> oh yeah
[2:46:28] <InXplotch> those fucks
[2:46:29] <+KilogramHours> save
[2:46:31] <+KilogramHours> SAVE
[2:46:31] <chococake420> LAST STAND if its 1 bp
[2:46:35] <SethKyu> The hammer that will pierce the heavens PogChamp
[2:46:36] <harlekuin966> big jumps for big boys
[2:46:36] <Papa_Bearman> I say jump.
[2:46:36] <chococake420> i think last stand is 2bp i forgot tho
[2:46:39] <bevyrage> he's full on BP already guys
[2:46:39] <%RichochetForce> Power Jump
[2:46:39] <%TheOneUpWarrior> suppah Jumpoh!
[2:46:40] <%lotharrio> Star Power is basically how you're healing.
[2:46:42] <Ultimatefool> ALL BALLS WOOLIE
[2:46:44] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> jump
[2:46:44] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> Power Jump, if we're voting
[2:46:44] <%kyh9> Star Power
[2:46:45] <+Grayhammatter> last stand or power jump
[2:46:49] <Papa_Bearman> No.
[2:46:49] <%Th3SmartAlec> @bevyrage He has 1 BP left
[2:46:51] <%DatAsuna> I say appeal
[2:46:51] <+marumariball> take 1 turn to get super meter
[2:46:52] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> no
[2:46:53] <%Th3SmartAlec> NO
[2:46:53] <%kyh9> Shout out random cities even harder
[2:46:53] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:46:54] <@Menitta> the Appeal one is gonna be more useful later
[2:46:54] <+pectusumbra> appeal is more star power
[2:46:55] <%pkdragoon> jump or save
[2:46:55] <harlekuin966> no
[2:46:56] <+ToastyMozart> no
[2:46:56] <The_Maddness> NO
[2:46:57] <Papa_Bearman> No, that's not true.
[2:46:58] <InXplotch> @WoolieVersus appeal is just skip a turn to charge star power
[2:46:58] <MonsterEnvy> It recharges your starpower
[2:47:00] <glass_marcus> Don't use appeal, just be good at the game instead
[2:47:01] <%kyh9> Appeal is star power
[2:47:01] <tttruest> star power is used for special moves
[2:47:01] <+Grayhammatter> no, appeal is just star power
[2:47:01] <%Ancopro> last stand depends on being good enough to survive at low health
[2:47:02] <+JoshuaSXM> NO
[2:47:02] <Darren716> It just fills your gauge faster
[2:47:04] <%RadicalWeegee> Roulette sucks
[2:47:10] <missingangle> I believe we get last stand somewhere in petal meadows anyway, don't we? Or am I thinking wrong?
[2:47:10] <%MayorRev> it's just a thumbs up thing
[2:47:13] <%DatAsuna> Last stand is just "lose slower"
[2:47:21] <Kirlrik> i really enjoy woolie playing a game without a living walkthrough sitting next to him again
[2:47:25] <Papa_Bearman> Star Power is what fills your Star Meter. Using "Appeal" forfeits your turn in exchange for gaining a TON of it.
[2:47:25] <DaBigVitus> is this considered "the good one" ?
[2:47:26] <+marumariball> later on the badges stack so its ok having duplicates
[2:47:30] <%RadicalWeegee> You can honestly go Full offence and be just fine
[2:47:32] <+Grayhammatter> nice investments woolz
[2:47:33] <DragonArt07> @WoolieVersus any thoughts on playing tales of symphonia, since it offers co-op reggie can play along.
[2:47:34] <InXplotch> last stand and the peril badge are really good if you are good at super counter
[2:47:40] <MonsterEnvy> Also Woolie you did not tattle the Mousers
[2:47:42] <bevyrage> oh i misread the BP pips
[2:47:45] <%SouLucha> Woolz, If you want to go safe, you'll want to have one for Jump and one for Hammer.
[2:47:53] <+ToastyMozart> Gets more SP for special moves, roulette is based on multiple good action commands in a row.
[2:47:56] <+Grayhammatter> stacks on stacks on stacks
[2:47:59] <Megafang2145> stacks on stacks non stacks on...
[2:48:12] <InXplotch> they hurt the same
[2:48:13] <+KilogramHours> The same
[2:48:17] <+Koover> you'll want to vary up your attacks
[2:48:17] <harlekuin966> piercing is just for high defense enemies
[2:48:24] <Papa_Bearman> Piercing Blow is for enemies with a defense stat. Otherwise, Power Smash is it.
[2:48:25] <+marumariball> pierce is for armored opponents
[2:48:29] <GenericSoda> one deals flat damage the other negates defense
[2:48:29] <SixthSun2> Piercing is situational
[2:48:30] <+Koover> different enemies might need different types of attacks
[2:48:31] <+skizzuto> I think power jump and smash are the same but some enemies are immune to jumps/hammer
[2:48:31] <InXplotch> some enemies are immune to hammer or jump
[2:48:33] <%Th3SmartAlec> Kappa
[2:48:36] <+KilogramHours> Thats for later
[2:48:37] <+ToastyMozart> 4dmg vs 2+2dmg, if memory serves.
[2:48:37] <@Menitta> Oh yeah
[2:48:39] <%The_Timo> Can't get it yet
[2:48:40] <MonsterEnvy> @WoolieVersus You did not tattle the Mousers in the shop
[2:48:41] <Mr_Strut> You ain't getting that for a WHILE
[2:48:42] <InXplotch> like the spike goomba you saw earlier
[2:48:42] <+Grayhammatter> that's endgame
[2:48:43] <Davybot> much later
[2:48:45] <Nyerp> chapter 1 any time now.....
[2:48:45] <%RadicalWeegee> Thats for MUUUUUCH ;later
[2:48:46] <Megafang2145> you can probably beat Gus now
[2:48:47] <%SouLucha> Enemies are situational, Jumping might be better or Hammering them.
[2:48:48] <+Nomicro4u> GOOMBA GOT BACK
[2:48:49] <Davybot> end game yeah
[2:48:54] <+KilogramHours> Kick Gus's ass
[2:48:54] <The_Maddness> STYLISH.MOVES
[2:48:57] <bevyrage> not end game, mid-game
[2:49:01] <%MayorRev> GOOMBA GOT BACK YEA
[2:49:01] <+Druuplays_> Gus kleanS
[2:49:02] <%The_Timo> @WoolieVersus if it looks different or hard to get to, you probably don't have the right skill / ally yet
[2:49:06] <TomFrancis_> seriously though why is there a noose?
[2:49:07] <+KilogramHours> Contact lens wont come for a few chapters
[2:49:08] <Toaster_Noodle> Go beat that guy up to let you pass
[2:49:09] <Papa_Bearman> You gotta go to the Peadows, dude.
[2:49:10] <%SouLucha> Yeah, I hope Woolz learns about Stylish..
[2:49:13] <missingangle> Contact lenses won't be available till later.
[2:49:18] <TeethMuncher> @TomFrank for criminals
[2:49:18] <+Slattsquatch> Power Jump is just utterly inferior to Power Bounce which is stupid OP
[2:49:18] <harlekuin966> every place needs a noose
[2:49:25] <+Zenryoku21> I checked up on the contacts so many times as a kid thinking it would unlock lol
[2:49:26] <kingkeldeo31> You get the lens like chapter 3
[2:49:27] <%Th3SmartAlec> You weren't 'locked on'
[2:49:29] <%SuperKirby24> goomba got back... cmonBruh
[2:49:31] <@Menitta> The noose really ties the room together
[2:49:33] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[2:49:35] <%RadicalWeegee> Gotta be right next to them
[2:49:35] <dinnydanny777> Wah!

[2:52:36] <+Grayhammatter> this is a fight!

[2:52:43] <dinnydanny777> He's a thief
[2:52:43] <%Th3SmartAlec> So Power Smash
[2:52:43] <@akuda_bar> @Spirit_NB yeah it requires some really incredible buffoonery
[2:52:43] <Glaicus> Remember you can switch positions with your partner.
[2:52:48] <Mr_Strut> Remember, you can royal guard ANY enemy
[2:52:49] <harlekuin966> SMASH
[2:52:52] <+pectusumbra> SMASH

[3:04:49] <+WheatlyXT> Spoiler: They are really good.
[3:04:49] <+AsinPersuasion> spend your money wisely
[3:04:54] <Papa_Bearman> So when you have multiple partners, changing partners costs a turn. Quick Change negates that.
[3:04:54] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> Quick Change is strong, but hold off on that.
[3:04:55] <Potatoidea> Japanese culture has an awkward relationship with blackface
[3:04:58] <%Th3SmartAlec> Oh.
[3:04:58] <%Ancopro> switching partners cost a turn
[3:05:00] <+marumariball> its like the persona 5 mechanic
[3:05:00] <@akuda_bar> Quick Change is fucking amazing
[3:05:01] <+Pippinitus> Changing partners count as an action
[3:05:03] <Darren716> It turns the battle system into ff10
[3:05:04] <Prevot> it won't grow
[3:05:04] <rcand9> great im finally a manga reader Kappa

[3:05:25] <harlekuin966> BIG NUMBER
[3:05:26] <+ArcanumArcanum> stop yelling every answer
[3:05:27] <+SvenHolgersson> If a Japanese game has a big lipped character you KNOW what design they based it off was
[3:05:30] <%Th3SmartAlec> hmmmm
[3:05:31] <tttruest> i kinda see it
[3:05:34] <%DatAsuna> Remember, new moves is always better than more health
[3:05:37] <nothuzad> fish have giant lips too woolie
[3:05:38] <+SvenHolgersson> Don't pretend you dont see it
[3:05:38] <kukstorm> I thought his had shadowed his face
[3:05:39] <$NoWayRyanTatum> understandable
[3:05:40] <%DatAsuna> Don't be bloodborne pat
[3:05:41] <+zooeymainbtw> its the shadow of his hat silly
[3:05:42] <%tomokocchi_> I just see a clown but I'm white
[3:05:43] <InXplotch> be careful wreggie
[3:05:46] <%RichochetForce> @SvenHolgersson Yup, after Terra Formars I give no Japanese media the benefit of the doubt.
[3:05:47] <Nomad94> @SvenHolgersson japanese folklore, that's right! you get a gold star!
[3:05:48] <tttruest> something something product of its time
[3:05:49] <harlekuin966> its less the right answer and more peoples preference
[3:05:52] <UnlimitedBick> @rcand9 i don't use Twitch, but when i saw the tweet i stopped what i was doing
[3:05:53] <%Th3SmartAlec> KICK HIS ASS
[3:05:54] <+Beniial> He never appeared again after this game, so who knows
[3:05:59] <$Invlux> I'm gonna trust Woolie's judgement on this more than anyone in chat

[3:05:59] <+KilogramHours> FIGHT
[3:06:00] <DragonArt07> I just see a catterpillar guy with his face in shadow cause of hood

[3:06:02] <+AsinPersuasion> GRIND
[3:06:02] <+AbnormalVoid> if the lips are red, that's when I start to side-eye the design
[3:06:03] <BigNerdSam> It's fine Woolie, that was just a tiny Justin Tredau
[3:06:07] <%SouLucha> @ArcanumArcanum Tipping him off to Stylishg moves is worth it.
[3:06:09] <+Druuplays_> I’m black I see a clown but hey
[3:06:09] <BettyMwwaahh> White people always think it "could be a stretch"
[3:06:15] <+TheNewZealandStory> why are they playing this with a completely fucking up aspect ratio
[3:06:16] <Potatoidea> Oh yeah

[3:08:10] <+Grayhammatter> every attack can be stylish
[3:08:12] <HelluvaNohbody> You have to exceed everything
[3:08:14] <MyNameIsRasus> Hey Woolie. You can do a no damage run of this game. It's sick.
[3:08:16] <%Ancopro> bascially whenever it looks like you can press a button, try it
[3:08:17] <harlekuin966> woolie will figure it out
[3:08:21] <%Jpshum> He just got a block?

[3:25:11] <+KilogramHours> HP IS SAFE
[3:25:11] <Darren716> Oh nvm BP
[3:25:12] <Nekros4442> Doubling up on ur badges
[3:25:12] <CursedNobleman> LACK CONFIDENCE

[3:25:14] <Bouerd> BP GANG
[3:25:15] <%Th3SmartAlec> @tttruest Not yet
[3:25:15] <TundraOW> MLG MARIO
[3:25:15] <+Jonesman64> HE GETS IT
[3:25:16] <%DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus The reason people clown on the gamegrumps LP is cause they always buffed HP
[3:25:17] <TheLemuroid> More badges more power
[3:25:18] <%Jpshum> MP
[3:25:18] <bevyrage> FP is good for USING YOUR BADGES though
[3:25:18] <InXplotch> fp and bp are the best
[3:25:19] <Rawklobstah88> HE UNDERSTANDS
[3:25:19] <+ToastyMozart> Mario's too fragile at 10, go for HP
[3:25:20] <%FuqBoiSlim> It's his first time so HP prolly
[3:25:20] <+marumariball> @WoolieVersus BP caps at 99 its worth maxing out
[3:25:22] <AxelCezar> HEALTH ALWAYS UP
[3:25:23] <harlekuin966> WOOLIE ON IT
[3:25:24] <StarMechV> NO
[3:25:25] <Rawklobstah88> PogChamp
[3:25:25] <MonsterEnvy> No that is not how it works
[3:25:25] <glass_marcus> You have no badges right now
[3:25:25] <%baronblank> honestly all are pretty good
[3:25:25] <+SvenHolgersson> BP>FP>HP
[3:25:25] <+AsinPersuasion> well things cost more than 5 mp
[3:25:25] <%SouLucha> FP
[3:25:26] <Davybot> HE GETS IIIIIIIT
[3:25:27] <pmmori> YOU DON'T HAVE THE BADGES YET
[3:25:27] <faeron93> and now the hardest choice
[3:25:28] <+Dimfish> badge every day, fp every other day
[3:25:28] <SomersaultJustice> more badges means more iron
[3:25:28] <Bguy32> ONLYBP
[3:25:28] <+Slattsquatch> Woolie with the big brain meta knowledge
[3:25:28] <%eanscrale> Yeah BP is overpowered in this game
[3:25:29] <%Jpshum> Boost focus
[3:25:29] <+cdrom321> Some badges increase your HP and FP.
[3:25:30] <%yeknomlive> good
[3:25:30] <MonsterEnvy> FP does not work that way
[3:25:31] <Spliffdonk> YEYEYEYE
[3:25:32] <%tomokocchi_> damn remember when Paper Mario had EXP and levels
[3:25:32] <+Hawk_Rush> @DatAsuna also cause Arin went in hating the game
[3:25:35] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> Yo, Woolie is IN THERE!
[3:25:35] <DeadNinja1> He's done it PogChamp
[3:25:35] <%FuqBoiSlim> At least until he gets like 20-25HP
[3:25:38] <Bouerd> DANGER MARIO
[3:25:38] <+Vhose> You can chain two more backflips after a hammer smash for a total of three Stylish points!
[3:25:39] <+SvenHolgersson> Congrats you're already better than Arin
[3:25:41] <+BlumpyLumpkins> you only need like 20FP, then everything into BP
[3:25:41] <Rawklobstah88> CAN WE POGGERS IN CHAT?
[3:25:42] <%SouLucha> But you won't have the FP to use them all.
[3:25:42] <%mrjojothelion> He understands PogChamp
[3:25:43] <+Jonesman64> BP can turn into more hp or fp if you want it to
[3:25:45] <Otatoptohami> He's figured it out
[3:25:46] <+pectusumbra> I clown on the gamegrumps LP because they didn't even find partner upgrades until HOURS into the game
[3:25:46] <%Th3SmartAlec> He'll level up the others a bit
[3:25:47] <phatmac16> PogChamp
[3:25:48] <CursedNobleman> PogChamp
[3:25:48] <+WheatlyXT> I usually get flower for the first upgrade cause I wanna power smash my way through everything. But after that badges badges badges
[3:25:49] <%DatAsuna> @hawk_rush well arin being a shit is every GG vid
[3:25:50] <JetpackMcQuack> BP only run
[3:25:50] <%FuqBoiSlim> PogChamp
[3:25:51] <cochramd1992> so are any badges passives?
[3:25:53] <TundraOW> DANGER MARIO
[3:25:54] <Bguy32> Woolie fuckin getsit
[3:25:57] <+TheBigO75> PogChamp
[3:25:57] <+baggy3058> Need FP for BP
[3:25:59] <Megafang2145> Catching on QUick!
[3:25:59] <+AsinPersuasion> many badges are passive
[3:26:00] <+cdrom321> BP until you hit max.
[3:26:01] <+marumariball> @WoolieVersus there are badges that give you HP and FP even
[3:26:01] <StarMechV> FP and SP are different Woolie
[3:26:02] <bevyrage> @cochramd1992 about half the badges are passive
[3:26:02] <superlit_1> please do danger mario
[3:26:02] <%Th3SmartAlec> @cochramd1992 You're llooking at one
[3:26:03] <+KilogramHours> @cochramd1992 Yes a lot of them
[3:26:03] <%SouLucha> BP only run would be great.
[3:26:04] <%LoVezineTheAir> woolie KNOWS
[3:26:05] <%RioGascar> i like how its like: increase HP IF YOU LACK CONFIDENCE
[3:26:06] <+Dimfish> fp is very useful, bp is useful too
[3:26:06] <Drusain> GREAT CHOICE for game Woolie
[3:26:06] <Papa_Bearman> @cochramd1992 Yeah, a ton of them are.
[3:26:07] <Bguy32> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[3:26:08] <+Pixel_Matt> rooPog
[3:26:09] <MonsterEnvy> FP and SP are diffrent
[3:26:11] <tttruest> FP and HP are necessary eventually
[3:26:12] <%Ancopro> you get badges that can increase your FP/HP as well, incase you regret not levleing them
[3:26:14] <+tearfuldevil> @DatAsuna i have never gotten the appeal tbh
[3:26:14] <CursedNobleman> @cochramd1992 eventually you find +HP, +FP, and +atk/def badges
[3:26:15] <+ToastyMozart> You still need enough HP to not die and FP to actually use badge moves.
[3:26:16] <+Hawk_Rush> not all of them
[3:26:17] <%Th3SmartAlec> Not all of them
[3:26:18] <+SvenHolgersson> I beat the game with like 20 hp only
[3:26:19] <Darren716> Only the attack ones
[3:26:19] <%LoVezineTheAir> glass cannon build lets goo
[3:26:20] <InXplotch> @WoolieVersus you'll still want to pump hp until you get better at perfect guarding, lol
[3:26:21] <MonsterEnvy> No you can't
[3:26:22] <+Koover> Some are passive
[3:26:23] <%DatAsuna> One day you will buff HP< but not in the early game
[3:26:25] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> But getting back FP costs turns
[3:26:25] <%SouLucha> Not enough Badges to fill those slots in.
[3:26:27] <StarMechV> Nooo you can0t get back FP
[3:26:27] <Papa_Bearman> Close Call is passive, it's free.
[3:26:29] <StarMechV> that's SP
[3:26:29] <+ApocalypticExpress> hope you're having fun and enjoying. Imma bounce and catch it in the anime. enjoy the manga peeps
[3:26:31] <+Jonesman64> you can get FP and HP with sweet treat
[3:26:32] <+worldbrand> a LOT of badges are passive
[3:26:33] <%yeknomlive> i think woolie's saying you can use items and use refresh to get fp back
[3:26:33] <%Jpshum> This is crazy
[3:26:33] <TheLemuroid> Max mp can limit you
[3:26:34] <NevikGamina> LUL
[3:26:35] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[3:26:37] <%Ancopro> for your first level bp not bad
[3:26:37] <%SouLucha> woolieMIRIN
[3:26:39] <%Th3SmartAlec> Bonk
[3:26:39] <Nyerp> dont listen to danger mario weirdos
[3:26:43] <%Jpshum> Bonk
[3:26:44] <%yeknomlive> err yeah sweet treat
[3:26:45] <MonsterEnvy> You can only get back fp and hp with Treat
[3:26:47] <SixthSun2> Keep hitting it
[3:26:49] <%Th3SmartAlec> WAIT WHAT
[3:26:49] <+WheatlyXT> 5 FP would suck ass for a whole game
[3:26:51] <tttruest> he's gonna get one-shot by the chapter 2 boss because he never upgraded max HP
[3:26:52] <%DatAsuna> but yeah also don't take more BP than you have badges at the time
[3:26:54] <+SvenHolgersson> HE DID IT
[3:26:54] <harlekuin966> just get a comfortable amount of fp
[3:26:54] <@Moobot> Easy with the emojis @MisterRockett
[3:26:55] <kingkeldeo31> Secret
[3:26:56] <%Th3SmartAlec> IVE NEVER SEEN THIS
[3:26:57] <+magiclottie> you're generally fine if you upgrade BP more than the other 2
[3:26:57] <Drusain> I hope Woolie does the Pit before he's done with the LP
[3:26:57] <SomersaultJustice> BIG COOKING
[3:26:58] <reonome> PogChamp
[3:26:58] <+Audega> NEVER KNEW ABOUT THAT

[3:27:03] <+MisterRockett> ???
[3:27:04] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Useful little item
[3:27:04] <NevikGamina> you'll definitely want more FP to unga bunga more
[3:27:04] <Spirit_NB> I never found that one
[3:27:06] <Davybot> for the chef

[3:27:14] <phatmac16> ????
[3:27:15] <+Koover> warp pipe
[3:27:15] <MonsterEnvy> Pipe
[3:27:16] <StarMechV> @WoolieVersus FP and SP are different. FP is for badges Sp is for the map specials. FP doesn't regenerate with styling, SP does
[3:27:16] <+KilogramHours> PIPE
[3:27:17] <Darren716> Pipe
[3:27:17] <+AsinPersuasion> you can
[3:27:22] <fuji_92> pipd
[3:27:23] <MonsterEnvy> You skipped the pipe
[3:27:23] <straycatrock> ive played this game start to finish twice and ive never seen that item
[3:27:24] <@Menitta> @TeethMuncher you can get several
[3:27:28] <CursedNobleman> 4PM honey, time for your lump flattening
[3:27:29] <+SvenHolgersson> I wanna pipe Goombella

[3:27:33] <Papa_Bearman> Oh, I forgot what I had - I'm making barbecued chicken tonight.
[3:27:34] <+Jonesman64> o yeah she'll talk about areas
[3:27:35] <StuffHunter> "Danger Mario" is an insane build. Not for first playthrough... unless...
[3:27:38] <Rawklobstah88> Use Tattle in the MP.
[3:27:41] <+ToastyMozart> HP/FP early game, BP late game. BP early just gets your shit pushed in.
[3:27:46] <Potatoidea> Danger Mario is speedrun tech
[3:27:46] <dreamfillah> jesus @svenholgersson
[3:27:47] <%Th3SmartAlec> HMMMMMMMM
[3:27:48] <CrypticMochi> Early fp is still pretty good to consider over bp
[3:27:49] <DeadNinja1> The tease is real
[3:27:50] <kingkeldeo31> Special hammers give 3 jumps then pose, regular hammer is 1 jump then pose
[3:27:50] <+Estuko> She basically said fuck chat and just ask me

[3:28:08] <Papa_Bearman> Yeah, Danger/Peril Mario is a Stryder7X build; let's not do that today.
[3:28:09] <+magiclottie> @WoolieVersus so does you playing this open up emails about how bad Sticker Star is so you have a frame of reference for all the horrible stuff they do?
[3:28:14] <dreamfillah> when we get the time stop
[3:28:16] <+SvenHolgersson> HAMMER MAN
[3:28:19] <tttruest> why ask chat when Goombella has the answers?

[3:29:26] <+Buzzard42> TTYD
[3:29:36] <StuffHunter> @RioGascar Woolie is already going for badges, so this'll be a fun playthrough regardless.
[3:29:36] <%DatAsuna> good job
[3:29:41] <%SouLucha> Kinda.
[3:29:49] <%SouLucha> Sometimes they just give it to you.

[3:29:52] <missingangle> Secret tunneeeel

[3:30:18] <Davybot> hey man super paper is great
[3:30:19] <@akuda_bar> @TeethMuncher i'm so glad they didn't continue the series and run it into the ground
[3:30:23] <Darren716> Dont be hatin on super like that, its the best in the series
[3:30:23] <%Th3SmartAlec> Left?
[3:30:24] <gluemanofficial> (finds something necessary for progression) SECRETS
[3:30:25] <%DatAsuna> Super isn't bad, it's just not an RPG
[3:30:26] <FacetiousAF> thanks hero versus
[3:30:26] <%Ancopro> super paper mario had a very good story to it
[3:30:26] <+Powerpinch> @TeethMuncher actually they made one more and it's pretty good but the series has been dead since then
[3:30:27] <Zeif00> Isn't there a badge that shows the timing for all stylish commands?
[3:30:27] <jellssssss20> hype
[3:30:29] <+Juriasu> super paper mario has mr L though
[3:30:29] <VirtualLemon> super paper Mario is good
[3:30:34] <+Audega> See what's left?
[3:30:35] <%Jetzord> @TeethMuncher Hey man, leave Super Paper Mario alone
[3:30:38] <missingangle> Super Paper Mario is.... good. Definitely a downgrade from TTYD, but it was enjoyable
[3:30:38] <%RioGascar> idk i kinda liked the wii paper mario game
[3:30:39] <%DatAsuna> That said super IS a half step towards the miyamoto shit
[3:30:40] <%Th3SmartAlec> yeyeyeye
[3:30:43] <HungryHungryEmu> Thanks for the PrideFlower @heroversusofficial
[3:30:47] <+天使42199> super is NOT the best in the series but it is still good
[3:30:48] <@akuda_bar> @Menitta if the setting was wrong here the bridge goes fucking insane
[3:30:49] <Papa_Bearman> Isn't that cute?
[3:30:50] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> Super is good, but this game is GREAT.
[3:30:50] <Nomad94> Super Paper Mario has the best story in the series
[3:30:51] <straycatrock> super's story and writing are really good but the gameplay is ????????
[3:30:52] <%SouLucha> Paper Mario: DON'T BE SLEEPING
[3:30:56] <cochramd1992> that bridge is massively overengineered
[3:30:58] <+cdrom321> Make sure to go to both ends.
[3:31:00] <%kyh9> This game is just the fucking best
[3:31:03] <@Menitta> I believe it
[3:31:05] <tkuwari> Super is good but its no TTYD
[3:31:05] <+SvenHolgersson> COLLUSION
[3:31:06] <acidfruitloops> super paper mario is primo stoner game
[3:31:09] <TeethMuncher> @Powerpinch can't be true, TYD and upcoming Origami are the only ones
[3:31:13] <arkv01> the MIGHTIEST hiccup
[3:31:14] <%Ancopro> super paper mario was the start of lets be less rpg
[3:31:14] <@Menitta> On my game, it was just slow as fuck
[3:31:16] <glass_marcus> not YET
[3:31:18] <The_Maddness> OOf, thats relatable
[3:31:18] <+calvor2> Is this running on original hardware?
[3:31:19] <+Hawk_Rush> man, I'm so happy this LP is happening
[3:31:20] <%Th3SmartAlec> Kappa
[3:31:21] <CursedNobleman> waiting for some lady and the tramp headphone wire shenanigans
[3:31:24] <arkv01> don't suppress your hiccups, let it out like a king
[3:31:26] <+Hawk_Rush> i'm glad they're having a blast
[3:31:27] <+Jonesman64> Super Paper mario is a different good from TTYD
[3:31:28] <missingangle> Super Paper Mario had the Francis segment. Enough said.
[3:31:33] <CrypticMochi> I like Super, but I wasn’t a fan of its map pacing
[3:31:33] <%Jpshum> yaa
[3:31:35] <%Jpshum> whooo
[3:31:38] <Davybot> yeah its a dif type of good
[3:31:46] <Potatoidea> Yeah, the Switch Palaces

[3:47:06] <%GeneralSCPatton> @solidus_113 Bruh, the fabric of reality is probably made of math. Mathematical Platonism for life!
[3:47:14] <haitakaa> the order of multiplication/division and addition/subtraction doesn't matter
[3:47:18] <%wolfofsound> you did not say fucking LUL

[3:47:35] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[3:47:41] <haitakaa> technically multiplication and division are the same thing
[3:47:50] <@Menitta> Gotta learn goddamn Castigliano's Theorem in Italian.
[3:47:53] <SereneFox> If the fabric of reality is made of math no wonder I'm always bored and can't focus.

[3:49:10] <time_axis> they dont really use english for the letters anyway, e.g. Na for Sodium
[3:49:11] <Darren716> I mean half the table is based on latin anyways so no reason to change it
[3:49:17] <InXplotch> like Au for gold
[3:49:19] <jellssssss20> Positions can’t change that would defeat the purpose lol

[3:54:21] <sirmcslushers> If you guys are loving TTYD, i'd suggest afterwards awknowledging an indie game called Bug Fables. Was a breath of fresh air for people wanting another game that at all could live up to what TTYD provided.

[3:59:38] <fuji_92> yup
[3:59:38] <%RadicalWeegee> ITS A CRIME! It sucks :c

[3:59:49] <fuji_92> you lose the best fucking menu
[3:59:51] <Prevot> yeah but the controls are way better, so...
[4:00:03] <time_axis> you're gaining better controls though
[4:00:08] <rsg220> metroid prime 1 music Kreygasm
[4:00:09] <InXplotch> holy fuck I should sell my copy of chibi robo, lol
[4:00:21] <%DatAsuna> 2 is bae
[4:00:21] <@Menitta> Chibi Robo is expensive now yeah
[4:00:24] <prime_name> The brain meny
[4:00:28] <pixel_river> MP have the best menus
[4:00:33] <%RadicalWeegee> how much for chibi ;w;
[4:00:43] <@Menitta> Trilogy is still the best way to play 1 and 2 though.
[4:00:50] <%LynbellDaYo> can it please release on switch
[4:00:51] <@Menitta> Yeah it changes them to play like 3
[4:00:53] <Paranoid_Jumbotron> metroid prime title theme is the best title theme send tweet
[4:01:01] <%DatAsuna> The control change is mostly for the best but those menus are amazing
[4:01:02] <+DreyfussFrost> You can like the Chrono Trigger animated FMV intro if you want, but fuck off that the original intro was replaced instead of added to.
[4:01:12] <%GeneralSCPatton> Metroid Prime 3 menu gives me chills with that creepy music and the microscope specimen graphics. It just screams "You are looking at the end of the world in a petri dish".
[4:01:12] <VideoGameMobes> Metroid Prime 4.. it's going to be wild to see what that is. Metroid Prime is like, one of my favorite Nintendo game ever
[4:01:13] <%Javaa01> Yeah, Trilogy plays so much better
[4:01:23] <zocano> Echoes theme is like... just as good if not better
[4:01:27] <+BeefMcCat> Can we talk about the metroid prime 2 menus though
[4:01:30] <pixel_river> And then you get extended version in credits Kreygasm
[4:01:34] <%DatAsuna> Fucking give us a switch port of trilogy nintendo
[4:01:36] <VideoGameMobes> Trilogy is a great value for two of the best Nintendo games ever and Metroid Prime 3
[4:01:38] <zocano> The Echoes music is *so good*
[4:01:40] <@Menitta> Metroid Prime 2 has a killer menu
[4:01:53] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> Is prime 3 even bad?

[4:02:09] <%Jetzord> LUL
[4:02:12] <Prevot> prime 2 is the bad one of the 3
[4:02:14] <+worldbrand> MP4's difficult time adjusting could probably be largely attributed to adapting to modern FPS controls. imagine being able to strafe and aim and fire in MP1

[4:06:07] <harlekuin966> super paper mario was still on the level just different gameplay
[4:06:10] <%SouLucha> Super Paper Mario is still a good game though.
[4:06:10] <Prevot> new paper marios are NOT rpgs
[4:06:11] <missingangle> We don't talk about Sticker Star in this house
[4:06:13] <%doombawkzvs> Well Super Paper Mario is different but it's not per se bad... just... different
[4:06:14] <prime_name> No XP
[4:06:15] <%DatAsuna> Chibi robo Zip Lash is a good comparison
[4:06:16] <VideoGameMobes> They're adventure games with RPGs in them. It's aight but it's different
[4:06:17] <%RadicalWeegee> Super Paper Mario is still good its different and good
[4:06:17] <time_axis> the only winning move is not to play
[4:06:18] <TeethMuncher> You can run out of sticker!
[4:06:19] <%The_Timo> Super PAper Mario was still fun though, it was good.
[4:06:20] <%LynbellDaYo> the worst offence is all the fucking toads
[4:06:21] <+marumariball> theres no XP
[4:06:22] <$Invlux> Reggie's face LUL
[4:06:22] <a_mad_dragon> you get SO MANY STICKERS though
[4:06:24] <SomersaultJustice> it's not that bad
[4:06:26] <@Menitta> So therefore there is no purpose to random battles isnt it GREAT
[4:06:30] <Potatoidea> Color Splash has some fun stuff in it though
[4:06:34] <@Menitta> Its the toad image
[4:06:36] <@Menitta> YEAH
[4:06:39] <Saltmeisterr> super paper mario has a good story
[4:06:39] <%Ancopro> combat is INCREDIBLY simplified
[4:06:40] <pixel_river> Remember the interview with the producer saying Papaer Mario dont need to be RPG because there is Mario And LUigi series?
[4:06:41] <+Superbro64> In sticker star, its optimal to NOT FIGHT AT ALL @woolieversus
[4:06:45] <+Superbro64> its dumb
[4:07:01] <Thunderhog> @WoolieVersus Also theres no EXP in sticker star and forward. battles are legitimately pointless and you're better off just running from battles then wasting stickers fighting
[4:07:03] <missingangle> Super Paper Mario is fun. It takes away the RPG aspect, and you lose companions, but the characters and charm and humor are all still great. And the story legit made me cry as a kid, no lie
[4:07:05] <%DatAsuna> That picture's not literal for colour splash but it's still funny
[4:07:08] <prime_name> The first two Toads you meet on the docks are so interesting
[4:07:09] <Saltmeisterr> btw guys in Origami King theres weapon degradation
[4:07:10] <+Hawk_Rush> no character designs axellMad
[4:07:14] <Saltmeisterr> so have fun
[4:07:15] <@Menitta> Color Splash does have some unique toads but nowhere near the level of this game
[4:07:20] <%shanedelbon> shanedelbon subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! Yo! Two months now and holy SHIT PAPER MARIO! Yooooooo! Can't wait to watch the anime, bless up to you both.
[4:07:22] <+worldbrand> honestly i didnt like the character design in super paper mario either
[4:07:24] <%Kriss1827> super paper mario is good tho
[4:07:25] <Pnutz409> whoa does he have the Gameboy functional cover?
[4:07:27] <%DatAsuna> There's 3 sequels
[4:07:28] <%doombawkzvs> Thanks for the PrideLion @shanedelbon
[4:07:29] <VideoGameMobes> yeah it's a different type of thing
[4:07:30] <bevyrage> it's not just that all the toads are the same woolie, it's every npc in the sequels are also toads
[4:07:31] <FeelinNifty> Yeah, I actually really liked Super Paper Mario
[4:07:32] <%Ancopro> toadsworth dissappearing and being replaced with a generic toad hurts so much
[4:07:37] <Thunderhog> Super paper mario was fine, but not a traditional RPG
[4:07:39] <Potatoidea> There's a version of that image out there where they reverse cherry pick it to make TTYD look boring, iirc
[4:07:43] <KnivesEve> miyamoto says no
[4:07:54] <+Superbro64> Miyamoto said no tho SeriousSloth
[4:08:00] <missingangle> Origami King still doesn't look as good, even though they seem to be adding back in companions. Though the bosses are GARBAGE!
[4:08:00] <%Proxzo> Also they got rid of party members. It's just mario in the battles.
[4:08:01] <Prevot> sticker star was made by an all new team
[4:08:02] <%tomokocchi_> they don't even have original bosses anymore, Origami King has literal office supplies
[4:08:04] <pixel_river> Crossing fingers for origami king
[4:08:06] <@Menitta> The reason they went away from the RPG style is because Mario and Luigi RPG existed, so they thought why have two RPG franchises.
[4:08:06] <%DatAsuna> This isn't playing it safe though
[4:08:14] <%DatAsuna> This is forced experimentation for no purpose
[4:08:20] <%Javaa01> Boot up that Sticker Star after this LP for an hour and feel your soul be drained
[4:08:26] <+Grayhammatter> aw shit, here we go again
[4:08:37] <+Superbro64> Reminder that Koizumi had to hide Zelda lore in the original 64 game so Miyamoto wouldn't find it.
[4:08:40] <%yeknomlive> that'd be hilarious. just have 1 session of ttyd then do a full playthrough of sticker
[4:08:44] <resloxxx> Thanks for the PrideUwu @radicalweegee
[4:08:50] <%LynbellDaYo> It's super easy to install too
[4:08:54] <+skylerpilot> not even like they have to experiment though, the formula was proven already with 2 games! People love all that extra stuff in Paper Mario 1 and 2
[4:09:01] <VideoGameMobes> Paper Mario N64 / TTYD are both extremely good but the games past that just so different, they're good in a extremely different way. They should've branded those later games differently
[4:09:04] <pixel_river> Shigeru" remove all story" Miyamoto
[4:09:06] <$BallerSwagBro9k> ITS RAD
[4:09:14] <missingangle> I legitimately stopped playing Sticker Star midway through, it was that unbearable, especially seeing how huge a downgrade it was from Super.
[4:09:25] <Tuna_Can_0> LUL
[4:09:28] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[4:09:45] <+AbnormalVoid> It's really good
[4:09:49] <+Dimfish> i wouldnt play it, its alright but kinda cringey
[4:09:50] <cj_art> it's quite the high-quality shitpost game
[4:09:51] <Infinit_Phoenix> while super paper mario wasnt the amazing rpg these older paper Mario's were i really liked it
[4:09:53] <time_axis> you can only take one joke so far
[4:09:53] <%CommanderSqueaks> LUL
[4:09:58] <%PA_Master> Having played both to completion Sticker Star is bad, Color Splash is good and is like “sticker star done right”
[4:10:04] <missingangle> Have you heard of Bug Fables? It seems to be taking great inspiration from the good Paper Mario games.
