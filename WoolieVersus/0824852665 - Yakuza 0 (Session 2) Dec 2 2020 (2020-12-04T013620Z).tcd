[0:01:47] <OkamiDude15> heartbreak mermaid cover woolieMIRIN
[0:01:49] <prime_name> Talk about video games
[0:01:50] <%big_laser_boss> You ever heard of the quick-change clothes?
[0:01:51] <%ChoculaUltra> oh sick hoodie
[0:01:51] <+Falkdaddu> Friday Night is also on youtube
[0:02:07] <EBT93> Is Flux off, Woolie? Kappa
[0:02:07] <DatAsuna> it kinda isn't
[0:02:08] <reonome> oh jeez Y0 or Y7
[0:02:09] <+b_aleph> SU NA ONI I love you!!!
[0:02:11] <%Exiliator> Been spendin' most their lives Livin' in the yakuza's paradise~
[0:02:15] <OkamiDude15> he never really stops being kiryu
[0:02:19] <%jiggy_snipe> he came out the womb a badass
[0:02:21] <SjoeB89> Now when you get to good ole Majima on the other hand
[0:02:22] <T_Sasquatch> Ehhh
[0:02:25] <Solidnick18> that's the plan
[0:02:25] <%jiggy_snipe> he's just getting titles now lol
[0:02:26] <DatAsuna> The main problem with 0 is it's not actually much of an origin/prequel
[0:02:31] <BubbaGAN0USH> he's just at the bottom
[0:02:35] <%Terrarp> He's always the same
[0:02:35] <DatAsuna> It's kind of just another yakuza story
[0:02:36] <+PJSmooth> He's just more naïve in this game
[0:02:37] <%Alazull> It's not like he started wishy-washy
[0:02:39] <%teh_rawk> kiryu is the brick you throw at yakuza shenanigans
[0:02:40] <brunoberserk> he becomes more tired in the later games
[0:02:44] <seniormeatbox> Kiryu is brick
[0:02:44] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:02:45] <tabbymcgee> yakuza 0 is more of majimas game
[0:02:45] <OneThousandTomatoes> he had his moments
[0:02:46] <%Terrarp> Majima is kind of
[0:02:47] <$Halospaz117> He's a bit more hot heated in this one
[0:02:47] <SjoeB89> Majima is the real main
[0:02:47] <@Menitta> He's way more emotionally invested and kinda wreckless in this game
[0:02:47] <%astrophizz> he becomes more fatherly
[0:02:48] <ghostravens> i think pat summarized him perfectly: he is a passive character
[0:02:49] <PKSomething> It's another characters Origin story, you haven't gotten to him yet
[0:02:49] <%Alazull> Hair and suit
[0:02:49] <EBT93> He’s a bit gruffer in 0.
[0:02:52] <kentrix11> The thing that changes are his perception of the things around him.
[0:02:53] <Winner_92> crime ryu is a pretty strong summary
[0:02:53] <@Menitta> but only marginally
[0:02:56] <%Konquerer> he does mature quite a bit
[0:02:58] <morow1ec> he get's more and more tired of everyones shit
[0:02:58] <BoneBagMel> Pat says hi
[0:03:01] <Solidnick18> he will grow
[0:03:01] <flame_of_udun_> He develops a lot
[0:03:02] <+Tucker0603> well....
[0:03:03] <NotHereToStream> and he remains to look young throughout all the games
[0:03:04] <DatAsuna> Majima has a multi game arc
[0:03:05] <bobbyratlair> Kiryu is the best Superman
[0:03:08] <+AkronymCLT> Kiryu is the immovable object
[0:03:11] <+JustToWatch> Kiryu is the straight man to the insanity of this world
[0:03:14] <DatAsuna> Majima in 5 is very different to majima in 1
[0:03:15] <+Kyma1020> He gets more tired with every game
[0:03:16] <SjoeB89> Majima is the real main character here
[0:03:19] <OfficerMods> multi meaning 2
[0:03:20] <OneThousandTomatoes> majima is the real main character
[0:03:25] <PsychoPearl> Kiryu becomes more of a dad
[0:03:26] <iswearimjustdandy> Aint nothing wrong with a static character to balance shit out
[0:03:30] <invader_rin> I can't wait
[0:03:33] <President_valentine> Haruka
[0:03:35] <%Asuterisuku> Not this game!
[0:03:40] <%Alazull> Realistically Yakuza 0 is the origin story for Majima and why he's obsessed with Kiryu
[0:03:41] <OfficerMods> the little girl in 1985
[0:03:42] <OneThousandTomatoes> he gets older 🤔?
[0:03:44] <turbofolk> Spoiler everyone dies or misteriously goes away
[0:03:47] <OneThousandTomatoes> how?
[0:03:50] <Kghaleon> Liar, Pat told you way more about the story than that.
[0:03:53] <PsychoPearl> She's in the 1st Yakuza
[0:03:53] <%Terrarp> She doesn't exist in zero yet
[0:03:54] <DatAsuna> I'm looking at a capoiera haruka mod right now lol
[0:04:04] <%Alazull> Yakuza 1 is the origin of how Kiryu ends up being the tired old man in Yakuza 6
[0:04:09] <+Idziman> It's more that 0 references future games
[0:04:15] <$Halospaz117> Yeah, sidequests carrying between games helps make the world feel more alive
[0:04:20] <thequickbrownrabbit> disco suit when woolie
[0:04:22] <NotHereToStream> 0 has a character that appears in 2
[0:04:26] <SjoeB89> Majima is the real best Yakuza
[0:04:27] <%Terrarp> There's Yakuza 6 and 7 side stories that grab characters from zero
[0:04:31] <jotabranded> the cart guy is the best
[0:04:34] <+Dovahkiin6310> all substories are canon
[0:04:34] <KnightAsteran> fuck, there's a side quest that carries in to 6 and 7
[0:04:34] <$Halospaz117> @Idziman Well yes but the Kiwamis also references new stuff 0 did
[0:04:35] <OfficerMods> a HUGE side character is mentioned then shows up in 4
[0:04:37] <%Exiliator> BibleThump
[0:04:38] <+Anonylesssss> WE ALL DO

[0:04:46] <President_valentine> Nice try V
[0:04:47] <DingusMcBaseball> except all side quests are amazing

[0:06:01] <jinzerox2> wait when did he start the game?
[0:06:01] <%cisealnine> @SjoeB89 It is in fact PC.
[0:06:02] <$MateoPeso> reload
[0:06:03] <$Halospaz117> Didn't RE2 Remake also do that?
[0:06:06] <%Terrarp> reload save
[0:06:08] <+RunoEddie> you could just reload your last save
[0:06:12] <+MikeTD81> Life ruined
[0:06:14] <OneThousandTomatoes> @jinzerox2 earlier today
[0:06:17] <%LCLSmoothie> oh well
[0:06:21] <rReizs> just count the hours of break /s
[0:06:27] <Qsmash_> well you did see the origin at least
[0:06:28] <%MattDemers> Kiryu's just less sloppy as time goes on
[0:06:28] <Solidnick18> it takes some time
[0:06:29] <Winner_92> Crime Ryu has always been this way
[0:06:31] <jorniev> KYRYU ONLY LEVELS UP
[0:06:36] <$Halospaz117> He's a bit more hot headed and reckless in this one
[0:06:41] <+b_aleph> He was born this way
[0:06:42] <OfficerMods> little more ruthless and childish but barely
[0:06:44] <RyuShinden> G O O N S
[0:06:45] <Magoloso> YO LETS GO WOOLIE CHAN
[0:06:51] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> his character is a bit different, he's more fist-happy
[0:06:51] <%Exiliator> nice
[0:06:57] <lovesosa236> majima is more of an origin
[0:06:59] <jimjamstrawberryslamalam> yooooooo I live this series! so far Iv'e played 0-5 and 0 is still my favorite and hope you enjoy the ride!!
[0:07:00] <+Totally_Not_Toby> eat the money
[0:07:04] <+Totally_Not_Toby> eat it you freak
[0:07:05] <jinzerox2> @OneThousandTomatoes I'm just got in, guess i wait for the VOD, thank you!
[0:07:08] <kentrix11> IDK how honorable he was at the start of this game beating a dude that owned debts.
[0:07:12] <notsoy> killing with heat moves gets you big money
[0:07:14] <thetrashman_sc> he grows more mature over the years but he never really fundamentally changes
[0:07:14] <EBT93> He’s more willing to fight in 0.
[0:07:15] <bobbyratlair> Kiryus personality doesn’t really change but he does develop subtly
[0:07:16] <flame_of_udun_> He develops more from 3 onwards
[0:07:21] <Teh_Un> I hope he lets us see his reaction to nugget at least
[0:07:26] <RyanGelatin> acquire funds
[0:07:28] <bobbyratlair> Like in regards to how he views the Yakuza and stuff like that
[0:07:29] <+hailadilos> capitalism tech

[0:08:06] <OneThousandTomatoes> yep
[0:08:07] <Ryong> good
[0:08:15] <Cobaltor_252> @Ryong there was a pop off ye
[0:08:16] <+RunoEddie> if they really, really want to have an accurate play time, they could try to reload their save before the pause, maybe that would reset the clock
[0:08:16] <%Alazull> Yeah Real Estate is a bit out from chap 2
[0:08:19] <Magoloso> Spending early is fine, you make a looooot of money fast
[0:08:21] <%Asuterisuku> Ah yes, compost. Kappa

[0:20:02] <Solidnick18> it just makes you have more heat faster
[0:20:03] <%ZweihanderSteve> oh woolie's drunk. i think that increases chances of random encounters
[0:20:06] <Ultimatefool> SHIT he touched the pay phone
[0:20:06] <+Ether101_Prime> I think it also draws agro.
[0:20:07] <alvaroeltz> eeeeeh, fuck it
[0:20:07] <Darren716> Genesis came out 99 in US
[0:20:07] <kentrix11> How polite of him.
[0:20:08] <jinzerox2> Faster Heat Gain & Got into fight more
[0:20:10] <DedlokPM> @Menitta the same way Kasuga could play Virtua Fighter 5 in 1999
[0:20:10] <Darren716> *89
[0:20:10] <+Tucker0603> increased fights
[0:20:11] <%HollowedIdjit> @WoolieVersus it actually does get you into more fights, but there on some skills later that are affected by your booze level
[0:20:11] <$Halospaz117> More Encounters and Faster Heat
[0:20:11] <%doomerskeletor13> It increases random encounters yeah
[0:20:12] <OfficerMods> in later games you get literal pocket change for fights
[0:20:13] <@Menitta> Oh was it actually out in 88?
[0:20:21] <@Menitta> Nvm then
[0:20:35] <seaechiowai> no it was out by 91
[0:20:45] <Darren716> Nah it came out October 88 in Japan
[0:20:48] <+RunoEddie> lol, I beat the game and never realized you could organize the inventory
[0:20:49] <lovesosa236> judment was hard to make money in unless you did the VR minigame
[0:20:50] <%big_laser_boss> look at that end-lag on the charged punch. Sure would be nice if you could cancel out of it somehow
[0:20:54] <@Menitta> Ok yeah October 1988
[0:20:59] <BR0Speedwagon> Dangerous cut throat yakuza patiently wait as man they want to beat down uses phone.
[0:21:00] <@Menitta> That makes more sense then'
[0:21:02] <$Holycow8498> This game takes place in like December 88 or 89 i forget
[0:21:06] <thetrashman_sc> its recovery
[0:21:09] <@Menitta> December 1988
[0:21:09] <DedlokPM> @seaechiowai Mega Drive was 1988 in Japan
[0:21:25] <rufus2k2> Steve Fox that shit Woolie!
[0:21:27] <seaechiowai> aihhy fk me solid
[0:21:28] <notsoy> kill with heat moves for more money
[0:21:40] <OneThousandTomatoes> @big_laser_boss LUL
[0:21:41] <OkamiDude15> woolie is learning new fighting moves to use in real life so he's ready for machete man should he ever return
[0:21:44] <kentrix11> I think you get more money if you finish enemies with a heat move?
[0:21:48] <flame_of_udun_> Rush doesn’t have that many heat moves rn
[0:21:52] <%doomerskeletor13> I have the map memorized at this point after like 7 games
[0:21:52] <+MisterRockett> Kamurocho will become a second home to you, Woolie.

[0:22:22] <thetrashman_sc> kashiwagi is rad
[0:22:27] <Kghaleon> You didn't even lose a finger
[0:22:31] <thebehatted> if it wasn't Kiryu doing it, that would have been an incredibly stupid plan
[0:22:33] <BubbaGAN0USH> never realized the pin is gone
[0:22:46] <President_valentine> Kiryu is incredibly stupid
[0:22:48] <flame_of_udun_> Oops
[0:22:52] <%unclekulikov> revenge
[0:22:55] <OneThousandTomatoes> Kashiwagi is the 3rd person in the Judgement karaoke scene. hes on keys
[0:23:03] <Jrocy247> Kiryu's a Himbo
[0:23:03] <McAngrimStein> It was a bad plan either way, since the only reason Kiryu has a shot is because of someone else
[0:23:03] <President_valentine> its just that he's also incredibly tough
[0:23:06] <alvaroeltz> time to beat up the old man again
[0:23:12] <%doomerskeletor13> He doesn’t show up on the keys till you meet him in the story
[0:23:14] <jinzerox2> I hear Sega sold their Arcade business recently, wonder if that mean no more Arcade in future Yakuza

[0:23:51] <%Javaa01> Kiryu is not a brick, he's the entire goddamn wall

[0:23:55] <%doomerskeletor13> It’s his biggest problem
[0:23:56] <RyuShinden> PALADIN AS FUCK
[0:23:59] <+CptBritches> But he's got the muscle to back up his honorable bullshit so it's ok
[0:24:00] <%Alazull> Very Johnathon Joestar
[0:24:01] <McAngrimStein> he's a brick, house
[0:24:02] <+mechslayer71> I wonder how many people knew a second stream was happening?
[0:24:03] <velgaduere> @jinzerox2 I doubt it, if anything they'd be more inclined to do so. operating a building with an arcade in it vs. programming one into a game is very different
[0:24:03] <RagnarokAM> THE MAN IS SUCH A PALADIN

[0:31:51] <MidsizeBoss> slime gun
[0:31:54] <Solidnick18> for right now he's pretty scary
[0:31:56] <+MikeTD81> Also, a good way to earn a shit-ton of money
[0:31:57] <%doomerskeletor13> I feel like I remember him retaining his damage from the first fight
[0:31:58] <EBT93> He gets desperation mode, too.
[0:31:58] <+MrAtheGreat> Always level up before you face mr shakedown
[0:31:59] <+antthefool> You can also pause and pump yourself with juice while knocked down
[0:32:03] <lotharrio> He'll be on the full map.
[0:32:08] <honeyman18> Tough, but doable
[0:32:08] <+HitchhikingThrough> Nah you'll know
[0:32:09] <jinzerox2> Just like DMC2, dont use guna, especially shotgun. It will break the game :/
[0:32:14] <+Ether101_Prime> His health can take hits if you lose a fight to him.
[0:32:19] <thebehatted> he walks very slowly
[0:32:19] <$infinite_rotation> I don’t think I ever bothered to properly fight mr shakedown, I always just avoided him
[0:32:20] <+HitchhikingThrough> you'll see a floating sign that says "10 million yen"
[0:32:25] <+MrAtheGreat> I think you unlock the map seer
[0:32:30] <+plebeiusMaximus> its so weird, but after beating 0 then Kiwami 1, just seeing the ambiance of 0 is nostalgic, even though i played it like a couple of months ago
[0:32:45] <turbofolk> i just fucking shot him with the most broken gun on the game
[0:32:50] <%doomerskeletor13> Yeah he has a special icon on the map
[0:32:52] <jinzerox2> After the Shakedown, the Side Quest is now open

[0:42:59] <%doomerskeletor13> STONKS GO UP
[0:43:03] <%big_laser_boss> I abuse the quick-change clothes
[0:43:05] <%teh_rawk> drinks might as well be free in this game
[0:43:05] <+funnyfunnykid> @Jrocy247 OH RIGHT THE STONE LMFAO
[0:43:07] <RyuShinden> Well, the stone saved him
[0:43:08] <$phd_in_thuggery> SHAKEDOWN STONKS
[0:43:11] <%SuperKirby24> stonks go big ups
[0:43:15] <Space_Pagan> INVEST IN YOURSELF
[0:43:19] <Solidnick18> that is good
[0:43:23] <+evbites> Rob him when he sleepin
[0:43:25] <+antthefool> ALL THE CASH
[0:43:27] <TheHeroAppears> it's really easy to beat shakedown as majima
[0:43:27] <@Menitta> One weird trick
[0:43:28] <Magoloso> Wait on investing a little?
[0:43:31] <+harrisboe> @flame_of_udun_ Jerma, Shenpai just finished the game a couple days ago, and I feel like there was one more but I can’t remember who
[0:43:34] <AFlyingTaco1> It's basically like a gajillion dollars in USD
[0:43:35] <jinzerox2> Blue seal is Heat move related
[0:43:37] <+funnyfunnykid> Woolie better go bowling someday.
[0:43:41] <$infinite_rotation> That ones not easy to pull off but its rad
[0:43:48] <flame_of_udun_> @harrisboe Jerma actually liked the game??
[0:43:49] <Jrocy247> That was a good moment chat
[0:43:53] <%teh_rawk> 2nd shake down isnt as cool as the first
[0:43:53] <%doomerskeletor13> I’m sure he’ll go bowling
[0:43:56] <jinzerox2> R=Teal seal is technique
[0:44:08] <Solidnick18> taunt is prettttttyyy good
[0:44:13] <Magoloso> None of the shakedowns are as cool as the first one.
[0:44:14] <+harrisboe> @flame_of_udun_ Idk. He streamed it yesterday but I only caught a little of it
[0:44:29] <lotharrio> Remind me, yellows apply to all styles, right?
[0:44:33] <Fkain23> now i want to play 0 again damm
[0:44:35] <CelestialCage> @flame_of_udun_ He put 5 hours into it and said he wanted to at least put 10 hours total into it. Dunno how much more he'll do past that
[0:44:45] <%SuperKirby24> dem cheevos
[0:44:51] <CelestialCage> At least that means he'll probably get to Majima
[0:44:54] <flame_of_udun_> @celestialcage hmm, we’ll see I guess
[0:44:55] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:45:02] <Kghaleon> We getting Woolie to play the deadly premonition series next?
[0:45:06] <Mr_Strut> It's a tier system
[0:45:10] <SilverFaustX> is this going to be a 100% run?
[0:45:26] <CelestialCage> I finished all the substories for this game last week. I think I had my fill
[0:45:27] <flame_of_udun_> @silverfaustx most likely all substories but not 100%
[0:45:33] <+Nallex9> Can we all agree majima's music is so much better??
[0:45:35] <$Holycow8498> Health upgrades are for all styles
[0:45:46] <Hammatime8> @SilverFaustX Are you implying an LP that runs for eternity? I doubt it.
[0:45:51] <Winner_92> 100% in this game requires a lot of minigame grinding and learning how to play japanese gambling games
[0:45:53] <misterurbanthelegend> Mr Shakedown must be one of Yujiro's bastards!!
[0:45:54] <%Exiliator> Can you read manga in zero? I cant remember
[0:45:55] <+skyheys> check the magazines

[0:53:31] <Winner_92> yeah shenmue is a bad game while yakuza is a good one Kappa
[0:53:31] <tranquilturnip> Zardoz heads
[0:53:32] <DatAsuna> the shenmue comparison is very skindeep yeah
[0:53:34] <lotharrio> Ah yes, the stone heads of Geeza.
[0:53:37] <stukamod> So this is Star Wars ? Kappa
[0:53:38] <KillMyPast> Yakuza is Shenmue but fun
[0:53:41] <Ultimatefool> Woolie, there's an autofire button LUL
[0:53:43] <DatAsuna> Shenmue is more akin to animal crossing than yakuza almost
[0:53:43] <%doomerskeletor13> Kiryu is one of us
[0:53:47] <SomersaultJustice> GALAXY 2
[0:53:47] <RyuShinden> @phd_in_thuggery Shenmue is a concept. Yakuza is the application
[0:53:47] <Mr_Strut> Hate those pillars
[0:53:48] <%SuperKirby24> AUUGHH
[0:53:53] <Treuan> Watch out for Pillars, Men
[0:53:55] <+Brightstreak> @KillMyPast lol that's the truest!
[0:53:55] <%TheGohanSkywalker> Arguably the main thing Yakuza took from Shenmue was the focus on narrative storytelling
[0:54:01] <OfficerMods> is there a game closer to yakuza than shenmue?
[0:54:01] <flame_of_udun_> A A A A U G H
[0:54:01] <PanicSwytch> I had trouble getting the high score in Outrun
[0:54:04] <%ChoculaUltra> every time I look at how fun Yakuza games are I just think about how good Shenmue could've been FeelsBadMan
[0:54:05] <Jrocy247> How the fuck is he flying???
[0:54:11] <$infinite_rotation> You will never die from projectiles its always the pillars
[0:54:12] <T_Sasquatch> @choculaultra im serious , she's literally a character you can employ and date LUL
[0:54:12] <RyuShinden> THE JUKES
[0:54:12] <DatAsuna> I wouldn't call storytelling a focus of shenmue
[0:54:14] <notsoy> this is BEFORE you get to mahjong or other casino games
[0:54:15] <SilverFaustX> gg
[0:54:16] <Thunderhog> @WoolieVersus For the record guys, the arcade games on the PC port literally pull up an emulator program to run it, which runs on it's own separate audio settings separate from the main game. So expect the arcade games to get REALLY loud on boot. Guess it's authentic to real arcades being loud as hell
[0:54:16] <+Ether101_Prime> And you just pay your way through the game.
[0:54:19] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @KillMyPast Yakuza is Shennue if Shenmue was fun and good and had actual combat and GOOD

[1:49:45] <$Halospaz117> Cheer500 Yo, saw some confusion from both you guys and the chat regarding the video booth, it actually has nothing to do with the phone cards, to unlock a girl's video you have to complete the sub-story she's in. For example, completing the Bowling sub-story will get you Emiri's video
[1:49:46] <%Javaa01> It's only a short window
[1:49:47] <+QueequegTheater> Not long enough
[1:49:47] <$Halospaz117> Halospaz117's Cheer shared rewards to 10 others in Chat!
[1:49:54] <Momiziinubashiri> Thanks for the 2020Party @halospaz117
[1:49:55] <primaryfire> only the start dodges, after that it blocks
[1:49:57] <fuji_92> yup, just cheese
[1:50:03] <PerfidiousSinn> man, they probably had the McRib year round in the 80s 😭
[1:50:14] <Mr_Strut> I love excel saga
[1:50:17] <TheGershon> The japanese dub just had him speak like a normal person
[1:50:20] <au_d3n> does the mcrib have cheese?? i cant remember!!
[1:50:24] <jinzerox2> if you hold dodge, it become guard
[1:50:26] <%TopTierHarley> Woolie didn't stay in the suit?
[1:50:27] <%TopTierHarley> Smh
[1:50:30] <%Th3SmartAlec> this is one of many battle minigames that doesn't teach you what you'd think it should teach you

[1:51:32] <$infinite_rotation> WHY DIDN’T YOU DODGE!?
[1:51:33] <au_d3n> rad
[1:51:35] <Hammatime8> That shoulder charge has VERY little windup
[1:51:35] <+QueequegTheater> Use dodge to create extra distance

[1:51:37] <Magoloso> Sasuga Woolie-chan
[1:51:40] <+b_aleph> STOP EMBARASSING KIRYU!
[1:51:45] <user_naim> a whole 15% of the time
[1:51:47] <clloudberry> for the easy ones I think the dodge is better
[1:51:51] <au_d3n> @EternalJedi rad
[1:51:55] <+ducethegamer> and also the quickest
[1:51:56] <Haarute> lock on and quickstep if you want
[1:51:58] <+QueequegTheater> You're wrong
[1:52:00] <%TopTierHarley> You say that Woolie, but...
[1:52:00] <%Th3SmartAlec> THEN LOCK ON
[1:52:00] <+HitchhikingThrough> @WoolieVersus you can balls it out if you want.
[1:52:02] <Mr_Strut> It's cheap to try right now
[1:52:03] <Raishiro> yeah i'm with woolie here, dodging is easier for me
[1:52:03] <tabbymcgee> i always felt dodging was alwayss easier
[1:52:05] <haitakaa> easy mode unlocked
[1:52:06] <brachydios777> FUCK THE THIRD GUY
[1:52:12] <+NarcissistCactus> agree to disagree
[1:52:12] <+HitchhikingThrough> No you can totally do it, I just treat it like a royal guard
[1:52:14] <+zanzibar_junker> just quick step constantly
[1:52:15] <%doomerskeletor13> Dodging was easier for me
[1:52:19] <President_valentine> I did it by dodging
[1:52:31] <PortableBoredom> I also won this by doing it like a man, instead of running around like a coward.
[1:52:32] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Lockon/quickstep is at the very least probably the intended way
[1:52:33] <Zuzu_Pachulia> just cheese it by blocking
[1:52:37] <au_d3n> Dorito Spaghetti though.....
[1:52:41] <Magoloso> Dodging works

[2:00:10] <%RyTYoung> Just you wait...
[2:00:17] <Darren716> Wait is this the same apartment model they use for the Yakuza 4 cutscene with Taiga and Majima?
[2:00:29] <WG101> @Darren716 don't think so
[2:00:30] <notsoy> no way to be sure, but the series loves re-using assets
[2:00:37] <%Asuterisuku> 8 Tatami, by the way.
[2:00:39] <majima666> i dunno why but drinking beer out of a can is much worse than out of a bottle or glass
[2:00:52] <majima666> that last sip or two always has me bawking
[2:00:57] <orjin_streams> the hell are you talking about? cans are smaller and better to hide

[2:01:01] <%Livelinne> That tatami is dirty and gross

[2:03:04] <orjin_streams> at least in the 80's
[2:03:10] <Cynical_Canadian> Get used to real estate/land development Woolie, this series REALLY loves it
[2:03:18] <JMRboosties> @Asuterisuku real estate is to yakuza as triple triad is to ff8
[2:03:21] <El_GhostV1> The guy with the big gross leg
[2:03:21] <%Javaa01> Tiny spaces worth the MOST amount of money
[2:03:23] <%Exiliator> Tiny spaces, worth mega money
[2:03:24] <T_Sasquatch> Yeah tiny little spaces
[2:03:27] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> The first Fast and Furious movie had a truck full of DVD players as the grand prize
[2:03:28] <President_valentine> but that parking lot is worth a shit ton
[2:03:28] <somedude1013> MORE YAKUZA THAN YAKUZA
[2:03:29] <gbrincks> When that tiny space is the only free land in the city, yeah
[2:03:30] <+Chronobot> gang war over a garbage bin
[2:03:33] <Kghaleon> It's worth it when someone steals your parking spot

[2:03:52] <%alcors_wisdom> woolie you have absolutely no idea how true that is
[2:04:01] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> you're not yakuza anymore, why would you collect money for them?
[2:04:07] <WG101> woolie, loans are already extortion
[2:04:07] <+MrAtheGreat> real life petty lmao
[2:04:07] <+CptBritches> Welcome to Yakuza
[2:04:08] <%Asuterisuku> Oh, just you wait, Woolie.
[2:04:11] <Kejang> THATS LITERALLY KIRYU
[2:04:13] <President_valentine> its really just Kiryu
[2:04:14] <%Asuterisuku> Oh just you wait.
[2:04:16] <somedude1013> Oh absolutely
[2:04:17] <rReizs> just try building a donut shaped house because you can't buy one bit of land out of a big lot
[2:04:20] <Mr_Strut> Kiryu HATES crime
[2:04:23] <%Juriasu> Kiryu is basically a saint
[2:04:24] <+razorgem> STING IS AT AEW peepoPAG
[2:04:25] <+QueequegTheater> He's literally just Jotaro without a Stand
[2:04:27] <+kaiber132> nah thats definitely Ichban
[2:04:29] <+yukichocomilk> yakuza are HEROES
[2:04:29] <$infinite_rotation> A loan is diet extrortion
[2:04:29] <%doomerskeletor13> Woolie understands the series now
[2:04:30] <Mr_Strut> That's why he's a yakuza
[2:04:33] <PsychoPearl> Kiryu's a good boy
[2:04:35] <%kulmoth> Kiryu is actually a shit yakuza
[2:04:36] <+rsg220> kiryu justs wants to play with his hot wheels
[2:04:36] <Cynical_Canadian> Kiryu being a Yakuza gets more baffling with each game
[2:04:36] <%Asuterisuku> Kiryu is the worst Yakuza.
[2:04:37] <supersanic94> he doesnt 'kill' anyone
[2:04:40] <+MrAtheGreat> Kiryu is effectively Kamurocho's Pope
[2:04:41] <Darren716> Has Kiryu literally ever committed a crime?
[2:04:46] <Darren716> Outside beating down that dude
[2:04:46] <Magoloso> And you never will
[2:04:47] <%RyTYoung> LUL LUL LUL

[2:04:50] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @QueequegTheater he literally glows different colors when he punches people super hard, you try to tell me that man does not have a stand
[2:04:51] <+mashinchaserr> extortion with extra steps
[2:04:53] <OneThousandTomatoes> assault
[2:04:55] <%Th3SmartAlec> @darren716 assault?
[2:04:55] <%Asuterisuku> @Darren716 Does child ganbling count?
[2:04:56] <velgaduere> @Darren716 yes, he did in the first cutscene
[2:04:57] <EBT93> Kiryu is a good guy that got into the wrong profession.
[2:05:05] <RyuShinden> MUH HONOR
[2:05:06] <thebehatted> I mean at least that part makes some sense
[2:05:07] <Mr_Strut> That's fine
[2:05:09] <$infinite_rotation> Honestly I feel like kiru is a little bit above giorno considering he doesn’t just straight up murder people that get in his way.
[2:05:11] <%Asuterisuku> Kazama.
[2:05:13] <PsychoPearl> Kazama
[2:05:13] <+paladinstarbuster> @QueequegTheater jotaro is smart enough to NOT join the yakuza
[2:05:16] <+CptBritches> Yeah but he can back up his honorable to a fault shit with his fists so it's justified for him
[2:05:16] <Joestar1890> @Darren716 I think he jaywalked once or twice
[2:05:18] <Cynical_Canadian> @Darren716 His col;assal waste of rubber bullets and explosions is polluting the Earth
[2:05:20] <$infinite_rotation> I mean all of those guys had it coming but still
[2:05:24] <+MrAtheGreat> Punished Tachibana
[2:05:25] <%Ancopro> Kazuma is kiryu, Kazama is daddy

[2:05:33] <ArrestedHouse> good crime
[2:05:36] <MistyPessi> Kiryu's only Yakuza for this game and like 30 minures of Yak1
[2:05:36] <Magoloso> That may be the statement of the series Woolie
[2:05:36] <jinzerox2> Gues he's related to Jin Kazama then xD
[2:05:40] <madtrixr> gonna have to keep playing
[2:05:41] <velgaduere> BRATTLE
[2:05:42] <brachydios777> What did Kiryu think the Yakuza do?
[2:05:42] <Mr_Strut> It lies in the heart of battle!
[2:05:43] <Joestar1890> @Ancopro Kiryu is also daddy
[2:05:45] <%doomerskeletor13> Kazama is dad, Kazuma is us
[2:05:45] <T_Sasquatch> Morality LUL HE'S a
[2:05:48] <$infinite_rotation> Kazama kiryu. Last name first
[2:05:49] <+NarcissistCactus> tpanimeYGOddduel
[2:05:49] <%Exiliator> Kiryu is like that image of a kids book that says "Real pirates dont steal", but for yakuza
[2:05:49] <%Asuterisuku> Gather info on Tachibana Real Estate!
[2:05:50] <+CptBritches> The Garden of Real Estate
[2:05:52] <Cynical_Canadian> ITS GROWING
[2:05:52] <Mr_Strut> Or hostess clubs
[2:05:52] <PerfidiousSinn> Kazama? oh you mean Fuma
[2:05:56] <Joestar1890> The answer lies in the heart of CRIME
[2:05:59] <MistyPessi> And 5 minutes as chairman
[2:05:59] <%Asuterisuku> You're about to meet one of the best characters in the game.
[2:06:00] <%doomerskeletor13> The Empty Lot
[2:06:02] <%Th3SmartAlec> No, it's in the heart of Real Estate
[2:06:07] <deadpak_> Isn’t kiryu’s dad a shit father?
[2:06:13] <jinzerox2> @infinite_rotation Kazuma, not Kazama
[2:06:18] <deadpak_> Kazama that is
[2:06:21] <+yukichocomilk> yes
[2:06:25] <%alcors_wisdom> LITTLE V kiryu has spent like barely 2 years ACTUALLY being a yakuza hes kicked out/quit like 80% of the time
[2:06:26] <MistyPessi> Kiryu's adopted
[2:06:30] <President_valentine> Not a shit father but definitely not a good person
[2:06:37] <PsychoPearl> Kazuma is Kiryu's first name
[2:06:37] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> "kiryu's not rich" he says with 10 million yen in his pocket
[2:06:39] <$infinite_rotation> Sorry about that, one letter off
[2:06:42] <JetpackMcQuack> Well, 2 people
[2:06:43] <orjin_streams> "Kono Kiryu Kazuma niwa yume ga aru"
[2:06:48] <$infinite_rotation> Kiryu is but a poor boy
[2:06:50] <rReizs> we dun
[2:06:50] <WG101> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug it's the 80s, that's like pocket change
[2:06:52] <fangovafang> hood Kiryu lol
[2:06:54] <JMRboosties> kiryu is a hero

[2:08:04] <+kaiber132> Need to go to a phone booth
[2:08:04] <%SuperKirby24> ded
[2:08:05] <@Menitta> there is a mod that adds save anywhere if you wanna go down that route.
[2:08:06] <$infinite_rotation> He’s dead and you killed him
[2:08:06] <%Exiliator> You sort of can on pc, but it can get messy
[2:08:08] <Magoloso> KIRBYMITAI
[2:08:08] <Cynical_Canadian> Why'd you have to kill Kirby in the middle of the Empty Couch?
[2:08:09] <%RyTYoung> BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
[2:08:09] <@Menitta> It does not autosave
[2:08:10] <%Asuterisuku> There is no autosave in 0
[2:08:12] <OneThousandTomatoes> woolie is now shaped like an enemy
[2:08:13] <madtrixr> i dont think theres an autosave
[2:08:15] <madtrixr> for 0
[2:08:16] <Wind_Burst> no autosaves
[2:08:16] <%cobalt_phoenix_> hey woolie where can one get that hoodie
[2:08:18] <%Livelinne> Kirbyyyyyyy joofbCry
[2:08:27] <%doomerskeletor13> It’s pretty archaic
[2:08:27] <$infinite_rotation> No autosave my man
[2:08:29] <%ElectricEmissary> ElectricEmissary subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months!
[2:08:31] <theotrainwreck> the closes to an autosave is that it gives you a save screen after certain story stuff
[2:08:35] <%alcors_wisdom> simply the fact that you arent wearing THE SUIT^TM yet
[2:08:35] <Space_Pagan> That's a sweet hoodie
[2:08:36] <Cynical_Canadian> There's a sorta autosave between chapters
[2:08:36] <%Asuterisuku> Keep an eye out for those payphones.
[2:08:38] <heylookitswex> We need morbidly obese Wednesday streams
[2:08:46] <deadpak_> I think it was 6 that introduced the saving anywhere, maybe 5??
[2:08:51] <@Menitta> LUL
[2:08:56] <@Menitta> ON the passengers
[2:08:57] <therealtacopancakes> that hoodie seems cozy as fuck, it's fire
[2:08:59] <PerfidiousSinn> save anywhere didn't come until 6
[2:09:03] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @secret_npc
[2:09:04] <Tupperwarez> YOOO, did they just start?
[2:09:05] <majima666> kiwami 1 had a save anywhere system
[2:09:06] <Space_Pagan> ON? LUL
[2:09:06] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:09:11] <@Menitta> @PerfidiousSinn nah Kiwami 1 did
[2:09:13] <Magoloso> ABUSE ME V
[2:09:19] <KitsuneManami> @WoolieVersus Hey Little, is it weird wearign a Eyepatch?
[2:09:22] <+condemned_15> 6, Kiwami 2 and Judgement fix the save function. Everything else is manual save stations
[2:09:23] <deadpak_> Revolutionary feature: saving the game
[2:09:23] <$infinite_rotation> Man I need to see the vod of this
[2:09:28] <GlaceonYo> Who is non-woolie couch man?
[2:09:29] <RojanBo> So hype that you're finally playing Yakuza. Dancing aside ;)
[2:09:35] <Tupperwarez> aaaaaa so gatdam HYPE
[2:09:36] <%Asuterisuku> Kiwami 1 also had an autosave, but it was less reliable.
[2:09:37] <deafmelone> twice!
[2:09:44] <$infinite_rotation> Oh shit i didnt even realise v’s cosplay
[2:09:46] <fangovafang> I fucked up...ALOT LuvOops
[2:09:46] <+QueequegTheater> He gains another health bar every time
[2:09:48] <%Asuterisuku> And you can manually save anywhere.
[2:09:49] <%Javaa01> YET
[2:09:52] <+ducethegamer> he hits hard
[2:09:54] <Qsmash_> wel...
[2:09:57] <+SuzakuRising> The way the saving in 0 works is more thematic because it's the '80s, no mobile phones. Later games they do so it is save everywhere.
[2:09:58] <Cynical_Canadian> I got rocked the first time cause he only needs 1 or 2 hits
[2:10:07] <%Javaa01> Give it a moment, and you'll see a lot more health bars
[2:10:08] <%Exiliator> like a fighting game! :D
[2:10:20] <fangovafang> dat leg slam is a bitch
[2:10:21] <Tupperwarez> Your greed is the source of Mr. Shakedown's power
[2:10:23] <+JWAdvocate83> !discord
[2:10:30] <Cynical_Canadian> You need to be able to get up as fast as possible cause his stomp ENDS you
[2:10:37] <%alcors_wisdom> my only regret is woolie cant fully appreciate the bait and switch of majima's intro in this game
[2:10:37] <El_GhostV1> Not the stomp... NOT THE STOMP
[2:10:37] <%Asuterisuku> He does have command grabs, by the way.
[2:10:38] <$infinite_rotation> @woolieversus I cant believe in my entire playthrough I never bothered to fight mr shakedown again.
[2:10:45] <PerfidiousSinn> stomp is basically a 1 hit KO
[2:10:51] <+QueequegTheater> Brawler finishers actually do huge damage to him
[2:10:54] <secret_npc> Business is so much more important, you are actively ruining your time by dumping in Adventure
[2:11:03] <GlaceonYo> Who is non-woolie couch man?
[2:11:06] <%Asuterisuku> Hanafuda cards don't make a ton of sense to me.
[2:11:07] <%Exiliator> Finally
[2:11:11] <+QueequegTheater> @GlaceonYo Little V
[2:11:13] <theotrainwreck> Finally
[2:11:13] <+b_aleph> Mr. Shakedown grows (down) to be Shimano in Kiwami
[2:11:16] <+JWAdvocate83> I used to farm Shakedown on the daily
[2:11:16] <pixelkenj> Saturday...
[2:11:36] <DatAsuna> porn of your friends
[2:11:36] <OneThousandTomatoes> every day
[2:11:41] <@Menitta> I dont think thats true but idk
[2:11:42] <Mr_Strut> S-link for pron
[2:11:47] <gbrincks> Make friends, get porn
[2:11:48] <$Halospaz117> It is true, I've tested it
[2:11:51] <Cynical_Canadian> That's only for the hostess girls, the cards unlock random girls that are NPCs
[2:11:53] <+JWAdvocate83> @b_aleph Most drawn out garbage fight ever
[2:11:54] <$Halospaz117> Trust me, I know this game

[2:12:30] <%Asuterisuku> It wasn't running that well in the Tachibana Intro cutscene.
[2:12:35] <$infinite_rotation> “Or else”
[2:12:35] <midninetiesshinigami> Tell Majima I don't have spending money
[2:12:38] <Kghaleon> I just bought a house, I'm broke.
