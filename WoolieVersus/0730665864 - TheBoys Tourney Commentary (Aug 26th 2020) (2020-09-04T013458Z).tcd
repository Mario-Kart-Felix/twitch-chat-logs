[2:02:25] <%Reverend_Roscoe> The only good scene from new 'cop was THAT ONE
[2:02:25] <%Josef_Stryker> Man that mutation scene was horrifying
[2:03:21] <FutaSnek> @WoolieVersus The scene in Robocop 2 where the prototype Robocop rips his helmet off fucked me up as a kid cause you can see all the circuitry pull out of his eye sockets as he takes it off
[2:03:28] <%DensityD> great answer

[2:03:33] <sozemd> has mk11 devolved into projectile spam
[2:03:38] <%Josef_Stryker> One thing I super appreciate about OG RoboCop was that they didn't make his partner a romantic interest. Afaik they simply remained friends. Tho I haven't seen the sequels
[2:03:41] <FishTacosTonite> I mean the new Robocop was better Robocop 3but that's not saying much. Lmao
[2:03:41] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @FutaSnek the failed robocop 2s were great
[2:03:42] <%DensityD> take sonic fox down with angles

[2:04:23] <%yesar94> jax?
[2:04:27] <+CryptusMaximus> Robocop is the most zonery zoner in the game, so yeah he's pure projectile spam

[3:58:10] <%trustycoyote> @jiggy_snipe exactly. You can't be mad because he can back it up!
[3:58:13] <andre11dr> We never saw Terminor
[3:58:17] <Dova573> god I miss watching tournaments Damn you covid
[3:58:19] <arkv01> coulda just went nuclear
[3:58:19] <+JustToWatch> I realized sonic was a born show-person at evo when they held up goichi's hand after evo grandfinals
[3:58:25] <arkv01> but nah lets leave a few buildings
[3:58:34] <+jiggy_snipe> @trustycoyote you can dislike cockiness but you have to respect his game
[3:58:41] <+Blackenedcrustcynicism> Is it over?
[3:58:50] <%doomerskeletor13> I believe it honestly, if he had mained Joker the whole time
[3:58:51] <Muffinmastr> joker tooo goood
[3:58:53] <%doomerskeletor13> Yeah it’s over
[3:58:56] <%trustycoyote> @jiggy_snipe Fair. I agree
[3:59:00] <Muffinmastr> id love to see sonic joker cumbos
[3:59:08] <+Blackenedcrustcynicism> Sonic didn't play Joker? Did they play RoboCop?
[3:59:28] <%yesar94> spawn
[3:59:28] <%doomerskeletor13> They played Joker a few times, but they changed it up a lot
[3:59:33] <+linSP> did terminator show up
[3:59:35] <WakeUpThrow> SF played Joker for the first, 7th and last match iirc
[3:59:37] <+JustToWatch> sonic played like a dozen characters
[3:59:41] <andre11dr> @jiggy_snipe Also i think it's part of his strategy
[3:59:43] <%doomerskeletor13> No terminator
[3:59:46] <+linSP> aw
[3:59:52] <+jiggy_snipe> @Blackenedcrustcynicism he was playing alot of people including Joker and Robocop, it was dope
