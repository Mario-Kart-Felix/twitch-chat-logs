[0:13:45] <+Mendin> true BBB is somewhere between Dhalsim and Marvel 3 morridoom Morrigan if I remember my Yomi correctly
[0:13:53] <19thperson> one complaint about this game, and it's an unimportant one, but... I hate the barks and bits of voiced dialogue. not because "badly delivered" but because everything is way too on the nose and there's not enough of them
[0:14:08] <TieTuesday> classic neutral genius play
[0:14:34] <%trustycoyote> Teaches people to be deliberate with controls. I like that
[0:14:46] <GarbageNirvana> Huh, I didn't know Xanatos was in this game
[0:14:48] <+Prest0ff> yomi system is to fight option select i think
[0:14:55] <+Taisuru> First time catching one of these live, how does woolie do viewer matches?
[0:15:06] <TieTuesday> yeah it's definitely to keep OSes from existing

[0:39:03] <Aussie_Manny> Universal truth: jump > command grab.
[0:39:04] <+Mendin> Hey FC Community Guy: Is there an alternate skin/etc where a brief yodeling sound plays if Rook connects with that headbutt?
[0:39:05] <+TrashpandaOni> oh that is so helpful
[0:39:08] <+Prest0ff> no, but you can jump
[0:39:10] <%SvenHolgersson> Wow
[0:39:11] <%LVDoomien> @Funkyguy321 command grabs need to be jumped
[0:39:34] <Kitsunerasu> I like the game telling you what stuff you could have done
[0:39:48] <%LVDoomien> yeah its very high-accessibility
[0:39:50] <NotHereToStream> i guess you can't press buttons during command grab start up ?
[0:39:54] <%LVDoomien> right

[0:39:57] <Aussie_Manny> This ain't FighterZ. Can't just RAWR your way outta this shit! LUL
[0:40:01] <%SirGO0SE> Valerie can be scary, you can combo for 6 I think with her super right?
[0:40:04] <%LVDoomien> Rook's command grab has armor too
[0:40:18] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Grabbed
[0:40:20] <+Prest0ff> unless that move you do does breaks armor or does 2 hits, armor move wins majority of the time
[0:40:21] <NotHereToStream> oh god armour
[0:40:23] <%Ecchigun> done
[0:40:33] <NotHereToStream> armoured cg is lethal

[0:56:16] <+Mendin> For those who don't know the Fantasy Strikeverse, Menelker is the Akuma to Midori's Gouken
[0:56:19] <%Double_Tap_That> Too tall for Pat
[0:56:21] <%CaptainPileDriver> chat pat WISHES he had that much hair
[0:56:21] <%ChoculaUltra> Shin Pat
[0:56:21] <NotHereToStream> pat with good genes
[0:56:31] <+Taisuru> If pat wasn't short he'd be part dragon

[0:58:05] <+Mendin> Now imagine Akuma if he could also turn into a dragon and is not above like breaking your arm/leg mid-fight with actual crippling effects
[0:58:13] <+Mendin> That's potentially a Menelker
[0:58:30] <brunoberserk> damage is HIGH in this game
[0:58:43] <NotHereToStream> JESUS
[0:58:46] <%SomersaultJustice> PogChamp
[0:58:47] <%LVDoomien> yeah Bruno that's why its best to 5 lol

[1:14:56] <%jiggy_snipe> those steam reviews are ass. just pay $20 if you want everything
[1:15:09] <killaholic89> I do like the cosmetics
[1:15:13] <+ogrest> Switch with wifi isn't that bad, and I get that what I just said is heresy, but I am an evil cretin who loves ruining smash ping, and I will not take back my remarks as they are necessary for the salt harvest.
[1:15:15] <%LVDoomien> wasn't uh playing with friends in the core pack?
[1:15:16] <%CaptainPileDriver> add fantasy strike crashed
[1:15:23] <%CaptainPileDriver> right after i won a ranked bracket
[1:15:32] <+Bailey__gaming> is this good i saw it on ps4

[1:17:11] <killaholic89> valerie got it
[1:17:13] <%jiggy_snipe> you gotta monetize somehow
[1:17:16] <nmaten> Thats like the most consumer friendly f2p model ive heard of
[1:17:20] <floralkami> so F2P is try before you buy + more
[1:17:25] <%ChoculaUltra> its very samsho in the sense that one wrong move and you're basically fucked 7 ways from Sunday
[1:17:37] <%trustycoyote> Ah, I see. Sounds like a smart approach to it.
[1:17:40] <ValentineHearts> ok the pride flags on that characters moves is pretty awesome
[1:17:40] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:17:42] <%jiggy_snipe> yea the f2p is a very extensive demo pretty much
[1:17:45] <%CaptainPileDriver> i don't care for not beig able to play this with friends but it's not to terrible

[1:18:09] <floralkami> they kicked the router
[1:18:15] <%Solidnick18> ok
[1:18:15] <townzzzzz> you can't escape
[1:18:28] <+ogrest> @ChoculaUltra I feel like a lot of games are like that at high end play, but that might just be from too many years of blazblue
[1:18:34] <%astrofalcon1> LUL
[1:18:37] <+Taisuru> LT
[1:18:39] <TopTierHarley> Not being able to inivte friends is dumb
[1:18:43] <%ChoculaUltra> @ogrest very very true
[1:18:57] <TopTierHarley> why play a fg if I can't do it with friends
[1:18:59] <floralkami> @toptierharley gotta make money somehow
[1:19:05] <%ChoculaUltra> we've all seen ToDs in every Marvel game after all LUL
[1:19:13] <+ogrest> ^
[1:19:15] <pookam> Remember Tekken Revolution?
[1:19:19] <TopTierHarley> that's dumb just like Tekken charging for frame data
[1:19:23] <%jiggy_snipe> well you can buy the game
[1:19:26] <PlanetNixia> Dead or Alive 5
[1:19:31] <PlanetNixia> The FTP version
[1:19:33] <TopTierHarley> DOA is f2P
[1:19:33] <floralkami> @toptierharley .... most fighting games played online isn't with friends, tho
[1:19:38] <%jiggy_snipe> DoA5 and 6 have core fighters
[1:19:48] <TopTierHarley> You really think people sit in ranked lol
[1:19:50] <GarbageNirvana> Good call
[1:19:53] <Fuji808> "core fighters" lol
[1:19:56] <%afronooch> I like this way better than paying for characters tbh
[1:20:00] <Zayasu> doa 6 is f2p with 4 characters Jebaited
[1:20:01] <+ogrest> Tfw nine debuted and you could just get zoned out because you blinked and didn't counter pick
[1:20:01] <killaholic89> I really appreciate not having to buy characters
[1:20:05] <%Pinkiefan> When does the Halo 2 stream go up?
[1:20:05] <%jiggy_snipe> that's what its called LUL
[1:20:11] <TopTierHarley> yea f2P with 4 charatcers that rotate
[1:20:20] <%ChoculaUltra> you plays randos or people too far away from you for online - you play locals with your friends so you can SEE the salt slowly build up into vulgar obscenities and possible friendship ending.
[1:20:23] <%CaptainPileDriver> yes
[1:20:32] <+Taisuru> @TopTierHarley You can play with friends, just one of you has to buy it
[1:20:33] <floralkami> much rather play all the characters with an AI and see what i like rather than pay for each character
[1:20:39] <%jiggy_snipe> Woolie activated the lag switch Kappa
[1:20:53] <+Jaysky> Does this have rollback?
[1:20:57] <%ChoculaUltra> Yep
[1:21:02] <%trustycoyote> @Jaysky Yes
[1:21:03] <floralkami> yes, ggpo
[1:21:03] <+Jaysky> Goodo
[1:21:04] <+ogrest> @ChoculaUltra the most salt I ever saw was gundam battle assault 2, my friend picked psycho gundam, I picked a ball, flawless victory, I didn't even mind that he smashed my controller because I deserved that.

[1:23:06] <%CaptainPileDriver> DAMNIT
[1:23:09] <%ChoculaUltra> @ogrest I really hated how 3 onward they went the full 3d route. We could totally use a fresh 2d gundam fighter with like IBO and maybe Divers shit tbh
[1:23:09] <%LVDoomien> okay I see how it is
[1:23:14] <+Taisuru> Any of you G-Skillz?

[1:23:45] <+ogrest> @ChoculaUltra on the other hand though, IBO is so ready for a soul calibur knockoff because of it's insistence on melee combat that it hurts

[1:25:57] <Lophostrix_> CYAN MAGENTA YELLOW
[1:25:59] <%ChoculaUltra> @floralkami I'd say the current/modern renditions of Extreme Vs is more "arena." Hell, high level play is so fast I have to watch matches in half speed LUL
[1:26:08] <ValentineHearts> i mean 20 dollars for a super sick fighting game with the option to play for free is pretty good
[1:26:22] <killaholic89> can you stuff val out of yellow crossup
[1:26:42] <+ArtemisCroc> the game is a lot louder than the dev :(
[1:26:43] <+Taisuru> @killaholic89 No but it is punishable
[1:26:46] <floralkami> especially when most other fighters are $60-$90
[1:26:55] <%Solidnick18> a very colorful fight
[1:27:08] <+ogrest> @ChoculaUltra I just want a gundam breaker game that is both good and has vs, so far we've only gotten one or the other, and my Higouf custom needs to see real pvp

[1:29:08] <+ogrest> @GarbageNirvana official releases or can we count the bootleg rainbow edition of streetfighter 2
[1:29:09] <+Taisuru> @GarbageNirvana There's a point where they're too fast for me personally, I think this is a great speed compared to what it used to be though!
[1:29:12] <KeiPrime> rainbow is the best version of sf2
[1:29:15] <+DigitalAtlas> Any plans to do Killer Instinct friendlies with chat in the near future?
[1:29:17] <%Jetzord> MK11

[1:36:06] <Sarl109> wool can you lower the game volume a bit?

[1:36:52] <PlanetNixia> With so many games putting guest characters, I wonder what characters the developers would love to have if they could have a guest character from another series wattsLURK
[1:37:02] <+SergeEXE> @Taisuru The community is basically all in Fantasy Strike right now, but if you hop into the Discord people would love to play I'm sure

[2:25:06] <TheArrow_> i wish this game came out on literally any other system
[2:25:07] <MattDemers> Glad we have that magical HD Wii with the 8BitDo bluetooth receive so they can use Xbox controllers Kappa
[2:25:15] <Super_Voltekka> The undisputed best fighting game on the Wii
[2:25:16] <%FuqBoiSlim> @zgoten you made me yearn for something I never even thought of man woolieDATTEBAYO
[2:25:19] <+Finaldragoon> I'm sad that this will probably never get a sequel because of how expensive the license would be
[2:25:38] <%Wool> Baroque is P
[2:25:41] <+Ahegaliant> West Gets Shafted Part 509 (cont'd)
[2:25:42] <%Wool> P+Attack
[2:25:46] <Super_Voltekka> Maybe if we're lucky, we'll get an ArcSys Tatsunoko fighter
[2:25:49] <KnivesEve> yeah...
[2:25:56] <Super_Voltekka> Tatsunoko Fight 2
[2:26:01] <+parzano> so tatsunoko made a bunch of anime right? anime classics?
[2:26:05] <2DSuperiority> the sequel was all the DLC DoA got from Tatsunoko
[2:26:18] <Super_Voltekka> They're the Japanese Hanna-Barbara
[2:26:24] <+parzano> gotcha @Super_Voltekka
[2:26:35] <%SirGO0SE> psaWhat
[2:26:37] <+Finaldragoon> @parzano Tatsunoko has been around for over 50 years
[2:27:00] <%darthvaderwasasimp> Best version of training stage
[2:27:02] <+xerotwo> SourPls
[2:27:09] <%Wool> POLIMAR WITH THE WEIRD SUPER INPUT
[2:27:10] <Saltmeisterr> omg this character select is awful
[2:27:10] <%FuqBoiSlim> Idk about this character select screen tbh
[2:27:20] <%WutangchickeN> PICK 2 SHOTOS YOU COWARD
[2:27:20] <%jiggy_snipe> LUL
[2:27:22] <%SomersaultJustice> chum has that sick air super in this game
[2:27:23] <+Spankminister> Best Chun portrait
[2:27:29] <+xerotwo> POLIMAR IS BRUTAL IN THE ANIME doodStare
[2:27:33] <2DSuperiority> don't poke his nose Chun
[2:27:46] <Kitsunerasu> LOOK AT THIS DOPE TRAINING STAGE
[2:27:48] <Super_Voltekka> There used to be Hakushon Daimao, but he got axed in the sequel due to licensing issues
[2:27:52] <2DSuperiority> RIP rap
[2:28:20] <%darthvaderwasasimp> This track is so sick
[2:28:29] <%Th3SmartAlec> oh is this the game with the intro that Woolie uses?
[2:28:29] <Super_Voltekka> That's why there's an uneven roster between both companies
[2:28:29] <+xerotwo> A S S I S T O K
[2:28:29] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:28:33] <%Akizea> ya know, may rewatch casshern tbh. had an absolute banger of an opening
[2:28:47] <GarbageNirvana> Damage is in the BILLIONS
[2:28:47] <2DSuperiority> PUNCH A WOMAN
[2:28:56] <Super_Voltekka> Sins is one of the best anime reboots period
[2:29:21] <%SirGO0SE> this came out 3 yrs before mvc3? it felt like they were released closer together
[2:29:23] <%Wool> The movelist scrolling is kinda wack
[2:29:34] <+scorpiozilla> Air
[2:29:34] <Pingo_Pasketti> Batsu’s Level 3 has different variants depending on his partner
[2:29:45] <%Wool> Chun's level 3 is aerial only
[2:29:47] <%Th3SmartAlec> NotLikeThis
[2:30:04] <drefizz> We talking about Casshern Sins?
[2:30:10] <Super_Voltekka> It's her forgotten hyper from MvC1
[2:30:14] <+antarac> What the fuck is this onimusha?!!?
[2:30:19] <%DesDavis> they patched wii games?
[2:30:29] <Super_Voltekka> Dawn of Souls to be exact
[2:30:34] <GarbageNirvana> So here's my question, how the FUCK did you play this on a default nunchuck/controller
[2:30:36] <%Solidnick18> Hell yeah soki
[2:30:39] <stevo_scar> this is the one with Karas right?
[2:30:43] <%arkv01> holy shit is this the only fighting game with soki
[2:30:48] <spardanwarrior> Karas is in this
[2:30:51] <+AtomicVR> Damage listing in BILLIONS is so absurd and hype
[2:31:07] <stevo_scar> @spardanwarrior Thank you, then why isn't Karas on the screen Woolie
[2:31:12] <anuchallengertwitch> @AtomicVR I was just about to point that out, It's great
[2:31:21] <%Wool> Partner+Attack
[2:31:24] <GarbageNirvana> Whenever Karas is not on-screen the characters should be asking, "Where is Karas?"
[2:31:29] <ItsJustShawn> go for baroque!
[2:31:29] <%arkv01> he doesn't want us to nut 10 minutes into this
[2:31:34] <%The_Minotaur> Polimar just doing jazz hands at all times
[2:31:42] <%Wool> MegaCrash is burst Baroque is your RC
[2:31:52] <MattDemers> Game is a bit loud
[2:31:52] <WackyModder84> This game is the GOAT. Baroque >>>> X-Factor
[2:31:54] <Super_Voltekka> He also has the slowest backwards walk in the game
[2:32:00] <%Th3SmartAlec> is the POV camera like 3 ft tall if the lines are to be believed?
[2:32:20] <stevo_scar> @GarbageNirvana lordji1MyGee
[2:32:20] <Rabspat> Baroque is different from megacrash
[2:32:27] <%The_Minotaur> Okay, what's the greatest backward walk in fighting games? I have an answer, but it's from a shit game.
[2:32:34] <Mordexai0> RISE LIKE A DRAGON PUNCH A WOMAN
[2:32:35] <%Wool> Baroque is like BlazBlue Rapid Cancel
[2:32:42] <Super_Voltekka> No one's pointingbout that Polimar hails from WASHINGKYO? DansGame
[2:32:44] <APB_Harleqyn> Which meter was showing you Baroque?
[2:32:49] <%Wool> Baroque takes HP
[2:32:49] <APB_Harleqyn> I didn't see it
[2:32:51] <2DSuperiority> THEY GON NEED A MIRACLE
[2:32:57] <%Wool> Baroque is Partner+Attack to cancel a move
[2:33:01] <WackyModder84> Baroque is X-Factor Done Right
[2:33:04] <APB_Harleqyn> ahhh, thanks @Wool
[2:33:05] <BlackermanZX> KARAS yeyeye
[2:33:09] <Mordexai0> @2dsuperiority WHIP EM LIKE THEY STOLE SOMETHIN
[2:33:10] <Axle13j> Azrael's back walk is pretty funny. walks back with the Giant Dad energy "come at me"
[2:33:10] <+xerotwo> K A R A S doodScrub
[2:33:11] <KeiPrime> doronjo...
[2:33:20] <Axle13j> KARAS SwiftRage
[2:33:23] <stevo_scar> The Boy
[2:33:24] <%SomersaultJustice> of course woolie used karas
[2:33:24] <%arkv01> his textures look a bit on the select screen tho
[2:33:26] <Darky04> i love TvC
[2:33:28] <%arkv01> lemme see those closeups
[2:33:30] <KnivesEve> tokyo batman!
[2:33:40] <%arkv01> guess I gotta rewatch karas tonight
[2:33:43] <Super_Voltekka> He also has the lowest health
[2:33:45] <anuchallengertwitch> @Axle13j not to mention that he absorbs projectiles with his abs
[2:33:58] <%The_Minotaur> My favorite walk animation is Zepelli's backward walk animation from JoJo All-Star Battle. Shit game, INCREDIBLE amount of love put into the animations... which proceed to run at sub-30 fps
[2:33:59] <%Wool> why is the timer set to 30 seconds
[2:34:06] <Axle13j> @anuchallengertwitch yuuuup
[2:34:08] <%Th3SmartAlec> Assisto
[2:34:12] <%Akizea> holy fuck karas looks sick as shit too
[2:34:13] <Super_Voltekka> Yo how you feel about Matthew Lillard in the dub?
[2:34:21] <+213372bu> JOHNS
[2:34:23] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @woolieversus Baroque is sacrificing red life to extend combos. You gain more chains. Mega Crash is a burst that sacrifices HP and Meter.
[2:34:23] <%Wool> Fix the time, too @WoolieVersus
[2:35:04] <+Thunderhog> Yeah that sounds like the unlokcing save tech
[2:35:08] <anuchallengertwitch> I like Kokonoe's walk animations. Her hair flipping and the blase way she walks is satisfying
[2:35:14] <+213372bu> "I had to quit mid match" 👀
[2:35:15] <stevo_scar> Hey man, I think it was alpha2/3 that starts you off at full meter
[2:35:20] <%SomersaultJustice> time to buy saki, and hear woolie say "quiz nanario dreams"
[2:35:21] <%Wool> you gotta beat Arcade mode 6 times to unlock everyone lol
[2:35:28] <spardanwarrior> Ok, but does Woolie have the shmup unlocked?
[2:35:46] <zamzoph> should've gotten Jean Reno
[2:35:46] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1285426733492166656?s=20
[2:35:47] <rufus2k2> KARAS
[2:35:50] <%The_Minotaur> I just looked up Kokonoe's animation, das some swag
[2:36:10] <+213372bu> I'll have to check out Karas later, great design
[2:36:15] <stevo_scar> Man seeing the BILLION damage counter still gets me
[2:36:23] <%Wool> Everyone go watch Casshern Sins
[2:36:26] <anuchallengertwitch> @The_Minotaur I always liken kokonoe to a more pissed off, cat version of Tails
[2:36:28] <Super_Voltekka> Karas also has some of the best CGI in any anime
[2:37:11] <Axle13j> The light trailing from his eyes yo
[2:37:18] <+xerotwo> B A R O Q U E
[2:37:24] <stevo_scar> Mmm them chun buttons
[2:37:43] <GeltonZ> What system are they playing on? Wii, Wii U, or Dolphin?
[2:37:50] <%Wool> Probably Dolphin
[2:37:52] <anuchallengertwitch> You know what would be neat, wither Super Robot Wars warriors game, or a SRW Hyper fighting game
[2:37:55] <+Tdannzy> Port this game please
[2:37:56] <anuchallengertwitch> either
[2:38:03] <+213372bu> Yeah, I think they've used Dolphin in the past
[2:38:04] <Super_Voltekka> They had one on the N64
[2:38:05] <%SomersaultJustice> GOLD LIGHTAN
[2:38:11] <%FuqBoiSlim> if paper Mario is any indication he's on an HD Wii Kappa
[2:38:13] <%Wool> This game is a licensing nightmare, and is trapped on the Wii
[2:38:17] <%Solidnick18> alex and g lightan
[2:38:30] <+xerotwo> W O W doodStare
[2:38:36] <tykai1> my favorite fighting game
[2:38:46] <Super_Voltekka> Tatsunoko ain't doing much nowadays, they mostly make idolshit
[2:38:47] <+Thunderhog> So I have to ask. Who's busting out the PTX tonight?
[2:38:58] <+xerotwo> Why no Idol fighter? doodStare
[2:38:58] <Sulfur_Boride> Anyone in this chat have any idea what the fuck a "Tatsunoko" was before this game?
[2:39:02] <GeltonZ> I think there's still SOME hope for a Switch port maybe. But not on a non-Nintendo system.
[2:39:08] <%Wool> @Sulfur_Boride Speed Racer
[2:39:11] <Super_Voltekka> It means "sea horse" Kappa
[2:39:20] <+213372bu> @Sulfur_Boride I think my dad, believe it or not, at the time noticed a Tatsunoko character and wanted to play it with me
[2:39:21] <GeltonZ> @Sulfur_Boride Kinda sorta but only because I knew about the PS1 fighting game "Tatsunoko Fight"
[2:39:24] <%Wool> @GeltonZ It's not Nintendo's call. It's Tatsunoko's
[2:39:25] <%The_Minotaur> @Sulfur_Boride duh, it's Ryu and Ken's spin kick
[2:39:26] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Batsu looking great as always
[2:39:27] <%FuqBoiSlim> I mean, I knew about Speed Racer and Casshern. thats about it
[2:39:34] <+Thunderhog> I saw Cashern that's about it
[2:39:38] <Kitsunerasu> @sulfur_boride kashern sins I watched alot growing up
[2:40:03] <stevo_scar> So is Barouque the 'X factor' of this system?
[2:40:05] <GeltonZ> @Wool I only bring up Nintendo because I know NOA pulled a lot of strings to help get this a US release. I think getting the OK from Tatsunoko wouldn't be too hard.
[2:40:10] <Sulfur_Boride> @The_Minotaur shotoImpress
[2:40:10] <%LordSDB> @sulfur_boride. Karas,the science ninja and casshern sins we're the only ones i knew
[2:40:12] <%Wool> They had to remove a whole character from the game when this got ported to the West
[2:40:23] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Karasu is so cool
[2:40:36] <%Akizea> @Wool which one?
[2:40:38] <GeltonZ> @stevo_scar Yes. You sacrifice your red life for a cancel and a power boost dependant upon how much red life is sacrificed.
[2:40:47] <%EustaceDeCroix> EustaceDeCroix subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months! 19 months already, damn. Keep kickin ass Woolz, I'll be here to see it every step of the way.
[2:40:48] <BlackermanZX> SICK
[2:40:49] <%Wool> @Akizea Some genie character from Tatsunoko
[2:40:52] <anuchallengertwitch> I'm not familure with alot of Tatsunoko, but Karas and Tekkeman Blade look sick as hell
[2:40:52] <Admiral_PopnFresh> look at that DIO pose
[2:40:53] <%LordSDB> yeyey
[2:40:54] <%Akizea> o shit
[2:41:04] <%Solidnick18> when's the lost planet mech
[2:41:04] <stevo_scar> @GeltonZ That sounds so much more fair
[2:41:11] <Sulfur_Boride> Alright, karas looks fucking rad
[2:41:24] <%SomersaultJustice> GOLD LIGHTAN
[2:41:25] <%Solidnick18> yeeeeee
[2:41:26] <%Wool> Fun fact Gold Lightan is bottom tear
[2:41:30] <%Wool> tier*
[2:41:30] <+Thunderhog> P T X LETS GO
[2:41:31] <Admiral_PopnFresh> THE ROBIT
[2:41:33] <Axle13j> bahahaha I forgot a lost planet mech was in this
[2:41:34] <%Solidnick18> fuck yeah lost planet
[2:41:35] <%LordSDB> Also best version of Zero is in this
[2:41:43] <%Solidnick18> i miss lost planet
[2:41:47] <Super_Voltekka> READY. INITALIZING.
[2:41:49] <GeltonZ> @stevo_scar The plan was for this to be "The most balanced VS game". Says so in the intro. MvC3 was intentionally unbalanced to try to capture that MvC2 feel.
[2:41:51] <+Thunderhog> SourPls
[2:41:52] <%LordSDB> imo
[2:41:53] <%DesDavis> Lost Planet 2 was the shit
[2:41:54] <BlackermanZX> Trigger hell yeah
[2:42:00] <+moxwoll> dekai
[2:42:05] <%Solidnick18> lost planet to was the best
[2:42:10] <+Thunderhog> @WoolieVersus PTX is charge
[2:42:19] <Sulfur_Boride> Do Alex's Stun Gun Headbutt on the big boys to watch him hump the shit out of their heads.
[2:42:23] <anuchallengertwitch> Am I crazy for thinking a Super Robot Wars hyper fighting game would be cool. It'd be a licensing nightmare, but think of the team combos.
[2:42:39] <DedlokPM> @WoolieVersus @Akizea We got Yatterman-2 instead so we came out with the better end of the deal. mogsSmeel
[2:42:54] <Super_Voltekka> Fun Fact: If you summon the giant robots with Yatterman 1 or 2, they'll disappear from the stage and then come back a few seconds later
[2:42:55] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:43:01] <stevo_scar> I can see that
[2:43:03] <+Qsmash_> unblockable missles
[2:43:13] <%LordSDB> yatterman 2 and tekkenman blade was worth the trade
[2:43:17] <Axle13j> getting lost planet 2 running on pc nowadays is such a pain
[2:43:22] <GeltonZ> @Wool @Akizea The genie character was removed because of the French rights to the series. In exchange though they ADDED like 5 characters to the US release among other things. Really what we got wasn't TvC but SUPER TvC. Was even re-released in Japan.
[2:43:29] <stevo_scar> Who's this blue kid on the screen? I don't think that's a capcom character?
[2:43:36] <Super_Voltekka> Both Tekkamen are a legit high-tier team
[2:43:51] <anuchallengertwitch> @stevo_scar Megaman Trigger, from Megaman Legends
[2:43:51] <GeltonZ> @stevo_scar That's Megaman Legends Megaman.
[2:43:56] <stevo_scar> I know
[2:43:57] <%LordSDB> megaman voltnut @stevo_scar
[2:43:59] <%SomersaultJustice> @stevo_scar Beck Kappa
[2:44:01] <+vaporousTippler> I think it's Box Art Megaman from the Game Boy games.
[2:44:02] <+Slamantha> i think he's meming on you guys
[2:44:03] <GeltonZ> @stevo_scar XD Ah
[2:44:04] <+Thunderhog> So when i played this game, I just cheesed online with PTX since literally no one knew how to tech grabs and PTX's grab for some reason loops into it's self if you dont tech
[2:44:05] <+Slamantha> to hurt us slamanFeels
[2:44:07] <stevo_scar> but he will forever be stuck on that moon
[2:44:08] <%LordSDB> ah sorry
[2:44:10] <%FuqBoiSlim> Who's Megaman??
[2:44:11] <%Wool> GCYoshi is a pretty famous PTX player
[2:44:27] <anuchallengertwitch> @stevo_scar it's really hard to figure out sarcasm from text
[2:44:30] <BlackermanZX> some guy on the moon
[2:44:31] <%LordSDB> hey megaman legends hasn't had a game in over a decade
[2:44:33] <+GaiaGreen> Wait the big boys were LEGAL??

[2:48:03] <%SomersaultJustice> he has air powerbomb too
[2:48:07] <GeltonZ> Turns out all you had to do to make Roll a good character was give her a broom!
[2:48:23] <anuchallengertwitch> @stevo_scar alot of the models in this game are cool
[2:48:26] <DedlokPM> rooBooli NO BOOLI ROLL
[2:48:29] <%FuqBoiSlim> Why is Alex saying OwO during that air powerbomb

[2:49:53] <stevo_scar> LUL
[2:49:56] <%arkv01> YATTA
[2:49:56] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:50:01] <Super_Voltekka> Gainax animated an episode of the 2008 Yatterman reboot
[2:50:09] <%LordSDB> thats a good one @fuqboislim
[2:50:10] <%Solidnick18> yatter yatterman
[2:50:11] <%SomersaultJustice> War of the Planets
[2:50:12] <Super_Voltekka> Battle of the Planets
[2:50:13] <GeltonZ> "Battle of the Planets" and "G-Force"
[2:50:17] <MattDemers> Damn Ken those BOOTS
[2:50:28] <+Itselguapo> this fucking music
[2:50:33] <%Solidnick18> this game has some weird pulls
[2:50:49] <%LordSDB> do they hqve everypne unlocked?
[2:50:51] <2DSuperiority> damn I forgot we also missed out on the character themes
[2:51:00] <+213372bu> @WoolieVersus "Battle of the Planets" My dad actually noticed Ken and rented this game from me at Blockbuster because of it LUL
[2:51:10] <GeltonZ> It's SUCH a shame Samurai Pizza Cats didn't make it in the game.
[2:51:14] <anuchallengertwitch> @Solidnick18 that's what makes the roster so cool
[2:51:17] <Super_Voltekka> Casey Kasem voiced Ken in the dub
[2:51:27] <+213372bu> One of the first anime to come to US syndication I think
[2:51:30] <Vaxidd8> This game is so fantastic
[2:51:30] <%SomersaultJustice> I like hurricane polymar's theme, it sounds like Detective Gumshoe walking into a scene with decisive evidence
[2:51:36] <BloodiaMK2> Hold up, is this the only vs game where we get an Onimusha rep?
[2:51:36] <stevo_scar> Keeping it stylin'
[2:51:39] <%Solidnick18> @anuchallengertwitch i know that's what we need more in games
[2:51:46] <%LordSDB> it is
[2:51:54] <BloodiaMK2> wow
[2:51:56] <anuchallengertwitch> I appreciate Volnutt having more DAKKA in his moveset then energy blasts
[2:51:56] <%arkv01> @213372bu you got a coolass dad, most of ours were smokers who went seeking a pack halfway around the world :(
[2:52:06] <+RowenCleric> yep never could do other onimusha characters because of the actors faces I think
[2:52:19] <Super_Voltekka> Tatsunoko turned Yatterman-2 into a freaking VTuber, no joke
[2:52:20] <stevo_scar> What weapons does rock have in this?
[2:52:21] <+Thunderhog> CHARGING BIRD
[2:52:25] <BlackermanZX> oh i didnt realize Rock's VA is Luffy
[2:52:28] <stevo_scar> *mega
[2:52:38] <GeltonZ> @Super_Voltekka REALLY?! Well I know who I'm watching :B
[2:52:39] <BloodiaMK2> @RowenCleric Crap I forgot about that
[2:52:39] <%arkv01> onimusha 2 and 4 are fine though, all OCs
[2:52:47] <%Solidnick18> oh yeah that is luffy
[2:52:50] <%arkv01> 2 is technically based on an actor but it's just an inspiration
[2:52:52] <+RowenCleric> Id die for Jean Reno in Marvel vs Capcom haha
[2:52:52] <%LordSDB> drill machinegun and shield i think?
[2:52:53] <+xerotwo> HOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[2:52:54] <%SomersaultJustice> AWOOOOOOO
[2:52:54] <DerpioParty> Soda! Soda!
[2:52:58] <+Thunderhog> Yeah, if I recall, both yatters in this game are hella busted
[2:52:58] <%Solidnick18> i recognize it
[2:52:59] <%Struggleful> WHat are the chargers for polymar for? Is he like Jam or something?
[2:53:11] <BloodiaMK2> There was also Onimusha Tactics, but yeah that's never gonna warrant not even a cameo
[2:53:11] <%Wool> Yatter 2 is the ultimate Setplay character
[2:53:14] <+213372bu> @arkv01 :( To be fair that was about his only entry besides ultraman
[2:53:27] <stevo_scar> Aye the drill.
[2:53:28] <kei_ar_> megamans heat dome
[2:53:28] <+Thunderhog> Yeah I recall 2 being setplay nightmare with the robot super
[2:53:32] <anuchallengertwitch> guys, imagine how Broken Megaman.EXE would be in a hyper fighting game. He has the potential for a loaded moveset
[2:53:42] <stevo_scar> Take it no buster cannon, or maybe its a super
[2:53:58] <BlackermanZX> Mega.exe was in a fighting game technically
[2:54:07] <stevo_scar> no I'm thinking hypershell
[2:54:07] <BloodiaMK2> uhhh
[2:54:09] <GeltonZ> Yatter 2 is my favorite character to play. I'm usually Yatter 2 and Roll but I wish I was good with Saki. Loved her since MvC1.
[2:54:11] <BlackermanZX> onimusha blade warriors
[2:54:11] <BloodiaMK2> Wait...
[2:54:29] <%LordSDB> Saki is hella good in this
[2:54:30] <%SomersaultJustice> I wish they had at least kept all the capcom character's remixes
[2:54:35] <BloodiaMK2> @BlackermanZX You got good memory, I completely forgot that existed
[2:54:41] <%Solidnick18> get him luffy
[2:54:47] <%Wool> The only theme they kept was Roll's but they had an English version
[2:54:53] <GeltonZ> @LordSDB Yeah I hear she's good I just can't figure her out. I'm too much of a rushdown guy.
[2:55:05] <DerpioParty> Will someone please give Yatterman a Soda?
[2:55:11] <+cowkid222> zero is in blade warriors also right? is it zero.exe?
[2:55:11] <Axle13j> final shooting hype
[2:55:12] <%213372bu> 213372bu subscribed at Tier 1. 
[2:55:12] <anuchallengertwitch> @BlackermanZX oh yeah, he and MMZ Zero were in there. I'm more thinking of a hyper fighter, where the characters can do all sorts of crazy shit.
[2:55:16] <BlackermanZX> Shining Laser yeyeye
[2:55:16] <Sulfur_Boride> YOU NEED TO BE STOPPED
[2:55:17] <stevo_scar> Oh m good it is heat dome
[2:55:21] <+Thunderhog> lytWORRY
[2:55:21] <stevo_scar> my god*
[2:55:23] <Super_Voltekka> Gainax animated an episode of the Yatterman reboot, and Boyacky even got to point to the heavens, TTGL-style
[2:55:31] <DerpioParty> Zero from MMZ is in Blade Warriors
[2:55:32] <%SomersaultJustice> the HD cube can't handle these billions of damage
[2:55:34] <%Wool> Might wanna adjust Dolphin settings for this game lmo
[2:55:34] <+Thunderhog> Does sticking to the trainign stage help the frame issues?
[2:55:36] <DerpioParty> Not Zero EXE
[2:55:46] <%LordSDB> ah gotcha. she can play up close but she is the best keep away char in the game, team her with tekkeman blade or the science ninja girl and ya got a top tolier team
[2:55:51] <+RowenCleric> I love the announcer voice in this too so much
[2:55:53] <BlackermanZX> I could only hope for a full version of EXE rock in a fighting game with styles or crosses
[2:56:00] <%LordSDB> tier*
[2:56:08] <Sulfur_Boride> I assume Zero's busted as fuck in this game?
[2:56:09] <%Wool> @Thunderhog Generally you want to set Dolphin graphics to Asynchronous for this. Stage doesn't do much.
[2:56:10] <BlackermanZX> or even Beast out as an Install super
[2:56:11] <+cowkid222> interesting they picked that zero and exe. But yeah exe is to good to be left off
[2:56:13] <Axle13j> god I f ucking love that lol
[2:56:14] <%SuperKirby24> monkaS
[2:56:18] <stevo_scar> Sounds like the Power Stone AV a little bit
[2:56:21] <+xerotwo> doodDah doodDah doodDah doodDah doodDah doodDah doodDah doodDah
[2:56:22] <GeltonZ> @SomersaultJustice @Thunderhog They just don't have the shaders set up right. The Gamecube/Wii are weird in that they compiled shaders on the fly and that's what's causing the pauses. There are ways to fix this.
[2:56:22] <+ktothec99> Megaman Exe is the best
[2:56:25] <BloodiaMK2> @BlackermanZX That would be hard to do considering you have to take into account the whole Chip system
[2:56:52] <+Thunderhog> Gotchal. can't say im familliar with dolphin emulation, let alone proper set ups
[2:56:54] <%SomersaultJustice> I know, I'm just messing around
[2:56:57] <anuchallengertwitch> @BloodiaMK2 make him like Umvc3 Dante and have tons of moves. problem solved
[2:56:57] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:57:07] <BlackermanZX> @BloodiaMK2 well i've seen crazier stuff like Phoenix Wright so it could be cool
[2:57:13] <%Josef_Stryker> RIP
[2:57:17] <+RowenCleric> most characters are kinda busted in this I think
[2:57:25] <%FuqBoiSlim> Star Force Megaman would go crazy in a hyper fighter too
[2:57:40] <+Qsmash_> You can make most characters look really good in this
[2:57:43] <BlackermanZX> doodWAT
[2:57:43] <townzzzzz> get that volt tekkeaa in there
[2:57:45] <%Josef_Stryker> I remember the Fisticuffs episode where Woolie just beat Pat by zoning the shit out of him
[2:57:49] <Darky04> pick Zero. the best character in this game
[2:57:49] <%LordSDB> oh we got a blade
[2:57:49] <%SomersaultJustice> woo Doronjo
[2:57:51] <BloodiaMK2> @BlackermanZX PW is a meme at this point.
[2:57:55] <uncledoodsauce> SOMEBODY'S GETTING FUCKED Kappa
[2:57:56] <+cowkid222> tekkaman blade is so damn cool
[2:57:57] <GarbageNirvana> Woolie upset he can't play like the Globetrotters and has to play like the Lakers
[2:58:00] <Super_Voltekka> The most Dangerous Boy in all of anime
[2:58:05] <%SomersaultJustice> do her dumb counter!
[2:58:09] <+Qsmash_> I think Yatterman-2 is the best character
[2:58:10] <anuchallengertwitch> Tekken man Blade looks like an Eva and I'm living for it
[2:58:29] <BloodiaMK2> @anuchallengertwitch Voice by the man with the adamantium vocal chords
[2:58:35] <%FuqBoiSlim> oh so this is the reference those 3 demons in God hand were referencing
[2:58:39] <GeltonZ> I remember when the game came out EVERYONE complained about Tekkaman Blade being OP.
[2:58:44] <%FuqBoiSlim> *character
[2:58:45] <Super_Voltekka> He legit broke the Mic while screaming
[2:58:52] <stevo_scar> Reggie you played Gargos right?
[2:58:56] <+cowkid222> Tekkaman's spurs always made me chuckle
[2:59:11] <BloodiaMK2> @Super_Voltekka Tekkaman Blade was apparently in Super Robot Wars at one point.
[2:59:13] <anuchallengertwitch> @Super_Voltekka wow, that's some dedication
[2:59:17] <+xerotwo> PIZZA SLICER
[2:59:20] <Super_Voltekka> D-Boy is one of the most underrated anime protagonists
[2:59:21] <+xerotwo> BRRRRRRRRRRRRRT
[2:59:33] <+ktothec99> Man I remember playing this game just because I saw Casshern was in it
[2:59:44] <+Qsmash_> Saki is pretty decent up close too
[2:59:46] <+xerotwo> doodBeamL doodBeam doodBeam doodBeam doodBeam
[2:59:47] <stevo_scar> Kinda miss an OST like this in a fighter
[2:59:50] <anuchallengertwitch> @BloodiaMK2 I'd love an SRW hyper fighter, but unfortunately it'll never happen
[2:59:54] <Super_Voltekka> Tekkaman Blade is fucking amazing and it drove me to tears at several points
[2:59:59] <stevo_scar> Not really stuck in the 'ambience' just up beat
[3:00:12] <Super_Voltekka> BLASTER TEKKAMAN
[3:00:17] <anuchallengertwitch> SO FUCKING COOL
[3:00:17] <BloodiaMK2> @Super_Voltekka I think one of his best friends is the guy that voices OoT Link/ Guy Shishioh.
[3:00:35] <GeltonZ> That's right...doesn't Pikachu have a move that's a Tekkaman reference?
[3:00:39] <Super_Voltekka> No, but his twin brother is voiced by Dio
[3:00:46] <BloodiaMK2> Wow
[3:00:47] <+xerotwo> IRON DEFENDER
[3:01:01] <Super_Voltekka> @geltonz Volt Tackle is called "Voltekka" in Japanese
[3:01:02] <%SomersaultJustice> doronjo has air qcbs
[3:01:04] <%FuqBoiSlim> if you're looking for more upbeat fighter OSTs. the cyberconnect jojo fighters have pretty hype music
[3:01:15] <+xerotwo> doodBeamL doodBeam doodBeam doodBeam doodBeam
[3:01:18] <Super_Voltekka> Ironically, It's more like the Crash Intrude than a beam
[3:01:20] <+xerotwo> GRENADA
[3:01:28] <%Wool> I definitely don't miss fighting Saki lmao
[3:01:34] <GeltonZ> @Super_Voltekka RIGHT! Yeah!
[3:01:36] <%SomersaultJustice> hcb
[3:01:43] <BloodiaMK2> I can't look at Doronjo without thinking of Team Rocket
[3:02:01] <%Solidnick18> let's go tekkaman blade
[3:02:09] <anuchallengertwitch> I'm uncultured swine , but I swear if I blur my eyes Saki looks like Asuka
[3:02:19] <%LordSDB> Fighting saki is = keep her in the corner or dio
[3:02:28] <%LordSDB> die*
[3:03:18] <%LordSDB> Dang only if he knew tekkeman dpecial is what makes him so dangerous
[3:03:18] <%Wool> TvC netplay was basically fighting a bunch of Blade players spamming his hitgrab
[3:03:27] <%Wool> and the dumb crossup
[3:03:52] <Axle13j> Yeyeyeye
[3:03:54] <%Josef_Stryker> YEYEYEYEYEYE
[3:03:56] <BlackermanZX> the pressure
[3:03:56] <%SomersaultJustice> wooo
[3:03:57] <Super_Voltekka> @lordsdb You could say Blade... is a Dangerous Boy Kappa
[3:03:57] <%LordSDB> oh god playing fighting games on the wii was a nightmare
[3:03:58] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1285426733492166656?s=20
[3:04:00] <Darky04> PogChamp
[3:04:10] <kumaprime> yooooo!! TVC let's go!!
[3:04:19] <%LordSDB> woolieSMUG
[3:04:22] <%SomersaultJustice> GOLD LIGHTAN
[3:04:23] <+cowkid222> Reggie with the handicap?
[3:04:25] <stevo_scar> aye v.Joe
[3:04:32] <Taco_Salsaguy> OOOOH!!!
[3:04:33] <kei_ar_> The SET UP
[3:04:37] <%LordSDB> Yo zero so good!
[3:04:38] <%Wool> Literally the best version of Ryu
[3:04:46] <Super_Voltekka> I so fucking want Tekkaman Blade on a streaming service so bad
[3:04:46] <%LordSDB> this os thr best zero
[3:04:50] <%Wool> USE HIS ROBOT HYPER
[3:04:56] <+RowenCleric> its ok Reggie its Hyper fighting Ryu, gets a pass
[3:04:56] <SideChar> Reggie handicap went down to 2 stars
[3:04:57] <%Wool> SUMMON THE ROBOT
[3:04:58] <Super_Voltekka> Fuck you Saban
[3:05:04] <DSD24> Why does Joe's stance looks like Miguels from Tekken
[3:05:09] <%WutangchickeN> @WoolieVersus Reggie don't let them shame you there's no shame in ordering a plain, basic-ass black coffee from Tim Horton's
[3:05:12] <%LordSDB> wool is also right! best version of ryu
[3:05:23] <stevo_scar> Did alex just yell Yeet!?
[3:05:35] <%Wool> Ippatsuman had Lowain's Yggy summon before it was cool
[3:05:38] <BloodiaMK2> I hate to say it, I don't see the appeal in Alex
[3:05:39] <Aydarkzero> YEET
[3:05:56] <+cowkid222> Reggie just put on the weighted training clothes for this set it's okay
[3:05:59] <lucasx4500> I love this game
[3:05:59] <+Qsmash_> the one VS game where Ryu was good
[3:06:11] <%LordSDB> man if we get a tvsc 2 i want casshern sins casshern
[3:06:28] <%LordSDB> and gun dude fron Karas
[3:06:29] <DSD24> This song is pretty nice
[3:06:35] <Super_Voltekka> And I personally wantTekkaman Evil
[3:06:44] <Super_Voltekka> And yes, that is his actual name
[3:06:48] <Sulfur_Boride> Wait, was there a CGI anime for Karas?
[3:06:53] <Sulfur_Boride> IIRC
[3:07:00] <BloodiaMK2> I think an OVA?
[3:07:09] <Super_Voltekka> Karas is a the OVA
[3:07:11] <%LordSDB> mega crash is so good woolieGASM
[3:07:23] <+RowenCleric> Tekkaman Evil would be dope, still amazes me Karas got in here
[3:07:29] <%Wool> Mega Crash and Baroque are infinitely better than X Factor
[3:07:33] <GeltonZ> If we got a new TvC, loli Doronjo is a guarentee and I'd still root for getting a Pizza Cat.
[3:07:37] <+Qsmash_> Do a baroque cancel you cowards!!
[3:07:38] <lucasx4500> This game has the 2º best capcom roster in any fighting game, CvS2 still wins imo
[3:07:53] <BloodiaMK2> @Wool With the exception of burning your red bar, I would agree
[3:07:54] <sackerkappa> Death by tope.
[3:08:12] <DSD24> Isn't Baroque a Art Style?
[3:08:13] <ZeroTimeLeft> baroque is so good!
[3:08:20] <%SomersaultJustice> welcome to alex
[3:08:24] <That_Mojo> how many shirts has alex gone through so far
[3:08:26] <%LordSDB> @wool this is why this is my fav vs game out of all of them
[3:08:27] <%Wool> Baroque is BlazBlue Rapid Cancel but takes red health. Press Partner+Attack to cancel a move. @WoolieVersus
[3:08:30] <BloodiaMK2> Granted TvC's version of Zero is actually better
[3:08:42] <scrublord009> did i miss fantasy strike?
[3:08:44] <%Wool> TvC Zero didn't have lightning loops
[3:08:47] <stevo_scar> Ryu has his Donkey kick in this right?
[3:08:50] <%SomersaultJustice> air dive into hyper bomb was my favorite thing
[3:08:56] <+RowenCleric> @scrublord009 yea it was first
[3:09:00] <Sulfur_Boride> @stevo_scar Yeah
[3:09:03] <stevo_scar> Big wall bounce combo's for big boys
[3:09:24] <stevo_scar> Like I know I've seen dirty combos for Ryu in this game
[3:09:37] <%SuperKirby24> LUL
[3:09:37] <+LegenGaryTGP> TVC logic: add billion at the end of anything to make it sound cool...gues what it works
[3:09:39] <+republo> the dirty backhand
[3:09:39] <Axle13j> BEAT THAT CHEST
[3:09:39] <%Josef_Stryker> LUL
[3:09:43] <GeltonZ> HAPPY BIRTHDAY, REGGIE!
[3:09:43] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> ALEX
[3:09:45] <%Josef_Stryker> At ease losah
[3:09:47] <TheyCallMeVawn> ALEX IS THE BEST
[3:09:52] <%Solidnick18> fuck yeah alex
[3:09:55] <%LordSDB> joe the condor is sick in this
[3:09:58] <DSD24> They play Morrigan yet?
[3:09:58] <%Wool> oh no the worst stage
[3:10:01] <%LordSDB> gun counter!
[3:10:02] <BloodiaMK2> @LegenGaryTGP Mfw UMVC3 actually downgraded the damage into Million
[3:10:04] <+RowenCleric> Ryu and Alex probably near their best versions in this game
[3:10:10] <Sulfur_Boride> Ah. Furanku
[3:10:12] <%Solidnick18> that strong style shit
[3:10:27] <DerpioParty> Frank's a lot different
[3:10:28] <%Solidnick18> frank is pretty odd in this
[3:10:30] <%LordSDB> mega buster tho
[3:10:32] <%Wool> This Frank is a completely different character
[3:10:34] <DSD24> Frank West is so cool
[3:10:38] <Sulfur_Boride> Frank isn't even voiced by TJ Rotolo in this
[3:10:39] <DerpioParty> REAL Mega Buster
[3:10:40] <Super_Voltekka> And he's missing his VA
[3:10:42] <DSD24> Wow that voice is terrible!
[3:10:42] <BloodiaMK2> OH MY God!
[3:10:47] <+Qsmash_> I wish Real Mega Buster was in UMvC3
[3:10:48] <stevo_scar> I'm sorry is that Fronk East?
[3:10:50] <%SomersaultJustice> we peach now
[3:10:56] <DSD24> Its Hank West
[3:11:01] <BloodiaMK2> Frank's voice is hilarious

[3:11:02] <%Wool> I hate this stage so much
[3:11:04] <stevo_scar> his face LUL
[3:11:06] <Super_Voltekka> His model makes him look more like Niko Bellic
[3:11:07] <Sulfur_Boride> Dude who voices Frank in this apparently is the English vocie of Kyo from those English dubs of the KOF games
[3:11:11] <GetWicked> hey chat, is casshern any good?
[3:11:13] <+RowenCleric> Francs face is jacked up too
[3:11:24] <%Wool> @GetWicked High-mid tier
[3:11:29] <%LordSDB> sins is good yes
[3:11:33] <nioh54> frank looks.... awful
[3:11:35] <GetWicked> tight, thanks @Wool
[3:11:36] <stevo_scar> Oh man, take me back to Volcanic Rim baby
[3:11:37] <%SomersaultJustice> HEALING
[3:11:39] <DSD24> Yeah this is hard to see
[3:11:39] <BloodiaMK2> Good lord I hope he figures out the zombie assists
[3:11:40] <Super_Voltekka> Ironic, since Capcom published GTAIV in Japan
[3:11:42] <%Wool> IT HEALS ALL ROBOTS
[3:11:46] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @GeltonZ
[3:11:50] <%Solidnick18> Oh wow elena Kappa
[3:11:52] <Axle13j> The broom WutFace
[3:12:03] <Sulfur_Boride> THAT'S HILARIOUS
[3:12:04] <lucasx4500> chat, how are they playing this game in hd ? Is it emulated ?
[3:12:11] <nioh54> dr4 ffrank looks better than this
[3:12:16] <Super_Voltekka> They're playing it on Dolphin
[3:12:26] <DSD24> @nioh54 That's too far that version of Frank is still bad
[3:12:27] <lucasx4500> oh ok, thx
[3:12:59] <Super_Voltekka> Still can't believe they turned Ai-chan into a VTuber
[3:13:01] <Axle13j> SWEPT
[3:13:06] <BlackermanZX> real mega buster > frank mvc3 supers
[3:13:08] <BloodiaMK2> I'll never forget Ageojoe's Frank doing the unthinkable against Filipino Champ's Phoenix
[3:13:09] <Super_Voltekka> And Boyacky's a bishie now
[3:13:09] <DSD24> Cleaned your clock
[3:13:16] <GetWicked> @LordSDB do i need to watch the original to get it? or is it like devilman to devilman crybaby?
[3:13:18] <GeltonZ> Roll is so good in this game! She just needed her broom!
[3:13:18] <Sulfur_Boride> @BlackermanZX TBH, yeah...
[3:13:20] <%Wool> Charge is 214X
[3:13:26] <%Wool> Swing is 236X
[3:13:36] <%Wool> Roll also buffs herself if she mops over her puddles
[3:13:41] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[3:13:43] <LibriJamm> Roll is real in this. She'll mess you up.
[3:13:45] <nioh54> @DSD24 yeah at least this one runs like frank
[3:13:52] <%Solidnick18> Oh my god
[3:13:53] <%LordSDB> @getwicked sins is kind of a reboot
[3:14:05] <stevo_scar> Only thing missing for Roll is her MVC1 theme
[3:14:11] <GetWicked> thanks @LordSDB
[3:14:15] <BloodiaMK2> Quite the edgey reboot as well good god
[3:14:15] <Super_Voltekka> If Roll doesn't have a robot character as an assist, her healing super can heal them as well
[3:14:27] <Super_Voltekka> During a Crossover Combination
[3:14:29] <2DSuperiority> @stevo_scar her theme is in the JP version
[3:14:30] <%Wool> good thing Casshern counts as a robot character
[3:14:35] <%LordSDB> og casshern is a human turned cybord
[3:14:36] <+michingmallecho> I wish this wasn't only on the Wii woolieSPICE
[3:14:47] <%Wool> @2DSuperiority Her theme is in this, too, but as the Credits theme
[3:14:47] <stevo_scar> oh that's some bull
[3:14:52] <%LordSDB> sins he robot from the start
[3:14:57] <GetWicked> I don't mind watching an edgy reboot. Love the character's design though, so I'll probably watch both.
[3:15:15] <BloodiaMK2> I was curious about the original Gatchaman since I've only seen like.... one episode of Gatchaman Crowds
[3:15:16] <%LordSDB> but do some research just in case @getwicked
[3:15:19] <+Qsmash_> fire stages are a problem
[3:15:20] <%Solidnick18> Les vegas
[3:15:23] <Sulfur_Boride> If the Capcom FG division were to try and make a comeback, you think a sequel to this would be preferrable? Or maybe the return of Darkstalkers or Rival Schools?
[3:15:24] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[3:15:25] <%SomersaultJustice> YEYEYE
[3:15:26] <Meltgar> LUL
[3:15:34] <%SomersaultJustice> GOLD LIGHTAN HYPE
[3:15:40] <%Solidnick18> YEAH
[3:15:40] <%LordSDB> god i wish sins version was in this
[3:15:43] <%Wool> Gold Lightan is bottom tier
[3:15:46] <GeltonZ> @Sulfur_Boride Rival Schools would be a better bet. They could NOT make a new Darkstalkers.
[3:15:52] <Super_Voltekka> Engrish Joe incoming
[3:15:57] <nioh54> @Sulfur_Boride seems too niche
[3:16:03] <%Solidnick18> very les vegas
[3:16:07] <%LordSDB> smoking is bottom tier conformed kappa
[3:16:12] <Sulfur_Boride> @nioh54 Eh, I kinda figured that, too.
[3:16:12] <fangovafang> Shuda got Alex lol
[3:16:12] <%SuperKirby24> Kappa
[3:16:14] <%SomersaultJustice> I like the super where he stomps on you
[3:16:17] <stevo_scar> these grooves though
[3:16:28] <BloodiaMK2> @GeltonZ Them trying to make a modern Darkstalkers, especially if it needed to be 3D models, would be hell
[3:16:36] <GeltonZ> Gold Lightan looks SO MUCH like Sunshine from Kinnikuman.
[3:16:38] <Super_Voltekka> RetroCrush needs to grab as many of these old anime as possible
[3:16:52] <GeltonZ> @BloodiaMK2 Yeah, Darkstalkers is a very particular game.
[3:16:53] <BloodiaMK2> granted they made it work with Hsien-Ko Morrighan and Felicia but still
[3:16:58] <+RowenCleric> modern Darkstalkers, everyone is 3d models except Morrigan who is still her old shitty sprite
[3:17:00] <%SomersaultJustice> LUL
[3:17:00] <Sulfur_Boride> He detonated your soul?

[3:17:36] <Axle13j> oh cool
[3:17:40] <nioh54> @Sulfur_Boride id think theyd sooner do a return to form with mvc tbh
[3:17:47] <%Solidnick18> way better zero
[3:17:48] <+xerotwo> S M A S H
[3:17:51] <%LordSDB> better version of zero

[3:18:01] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:18:12] <Darky04> this version of zero is busted
[3:18:16] <BlackermanZX> x6 rekkouha
[3:18:18] <Super_Voltekka> Some of the WEBMs from the Gold Lightan anime on Sakugabooru are insane
[3:18:29] <stevo_scar> When is zero not busted?
[3:18:32] <crimsonsaens> Isn't every version of Zero busted?
[3:18:32] <GarbageNirvana> I forgot you could just play giant robots in this
[3:18:42] <BloodiaMK2> Also Zero's Level 3 in this game is just *Chef's Kiss*
[3:18:48] <+ManOfReason> SCOOPS
[3:18:48] <+RowenCleric> isnt even Teppen's Zero busted?
[3:18:56] <+Qsmash_> pretty much @crimsonsaens
[3:19:08] <Sulfur_Boride> @RowenCleric Yeeeeuuupppp
[3:19:10] <DSD24> I miss Lost Planet
[3:19:26] <%SuperKirby24> LUL
[3:19:30] <Super_Voltekka> If you choose Lightan's alt, he becomes Silver Lightan
[3:19:32] <crimsonsaens> Zero is even busted in MMX
[3:19:37] <%SomersaultJustice> iirc, if you land the stomp super, you can do DP + 2 buttons after the punch if you have 2 bars to get the L3 version of the super
[3:19:42] <stevo_scar> Should've bought more copies of LP3 Kappa
[3:19:52] <Super_Voltekka> He even calls his attacks like "SILVER CRASH!"

[3:21:33] <Super_Voltekka> Pick the Orbital Ring Stage next
[3:21:41] <Super_Voltekka> It has the best song in the game
[3:21:42] <GeltonZ> I love how Dimps was like "There's no way we could do a Darkstalkers character in 3D with current technology" and Eighting was like "We can do it on the Wii."
[3:21:43] <+xerotwo> STICKY BOMBS
[3:21:49] <+scorpiozilla> It did, but also Puzzle and Pocket Fighter
[3:22:00] <Axle13j> LOL

[3:23:10] <GeltonZ> One NICE thing about cutting the character themes: You canb play Jun the Swan without having to deal with her theme
[3:23:13] <DSD24> Yooooo
[3:23:18] <DSD24> That was rad
[3:23:37] <%LordSDB> Full bar with demon mode is busted!
[3:23:39] <+RowenCleric> Soki deserved a better game LUL
[3:23:46] <%LordSDB> You can still do the other specials while going to!
[3:23:58] <GeltonZ> MAN I love this game. Can I just say I love how this game LOOKS? Like the specific way they shaded the characters works really well.
[3:24:00] <%brothernerofgc> yo this game needs more love
[3:24:10] <DSD24> Soul Fist!
[3:24:21] <%brothernerofgc> i like this more than marvel 3
[3:24:33] <GeltonZ> SAME.
[3:24:40] <stevo_scar> damn forgot how much real estate soul fist takes up
[3:24:55] <crimsonsaens> Just run away
[3:25:06] <%jinking79> how the fuck did a power stone character not make it in the game
[3:25:06] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:25:11] <%SomersaultJustice> NYOHOHOHO
[3:25:23] <townzzzzz> shadow ball my man
[3:25:25] <crimsonsaens> How is Power Stone not represented in any of the VS games?
[3:25:34] <DeathByPoke7> 6000 billion damage
[3:25:46] <%LordSDB> Drop kicked!
[3:25:52] <%LordSDB> psaDab
[3:25:54] <+RowenCleric> can we get those smash melee people to add rollback to this game?
[3:25:59] <Super_Voltekka> Does Falcon's cameo in the Nairobi stage count?
[3:26:00] <GeltonZ> ...yeah we DO need Power Stone rep...especially if it's Rouge :B
[3:26:23] <crimsonsaens> @Super_Voltekka Cameo's don't count
[3:26:29] <%paladinstarbuster> ippatsuman
[3:26:36] <+xerotwo> R E D K A R A S
[3:26:38] <kei_ar_> always mad that batsu never got the MVC treatment
[3:26:39] <GeltonZ> @RowenCleric I think they might already have? I know you can play Dolphin online and the netcode is pretty good and this DOES have an online scene.
[3:26:44] <wrydiculous> oh boi tekkaman blade time
[3:26:53] <Meltgar> @WoolieVersus Did this game actually do well in sales and being liked?
[3:26:56] <tsunami_33> tekkaman blade OP
[3:26:58] <Super_Voltekka> T E K S E T T E R
[3:27:02] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @MiraLangsuir
[3:27:16] <wrydiculous> Mr Mic Breaker
[3:27:17] <GeltonZ> @Meltgar No. No one bought it because it was on Wii and MvC3 was announced too soon.
[3:27:23] <kei_ar_> liked? i think yeah cause ive never heard people HATING the game just some gripes. sales? uhhhhhh
[3:27:30] <+RowenCleric> Really? damn Im gonna have to download this and check it out
[3:27:31] <Meltgar> @GeltonZ Ouch, that's rough
[3:27:36] <%jinking79> no one watched the power stone anime
[3:27:39] <%LordSDB> I see he learned the Tekkenman Blade Tech Kappa
[3:27:45] <Super_Voltekka> If Saban didn't ruin everything with Teknoman, that show would've been on streaming services
[3:27:45] <stevo_scar> @jinking79
[3:27:54] <MiraLangsuir> I yelled so hard the mic broke and the bot silenced me ;o;
[3:27:58] <GeltonZ> @jinking79 Didn't help that it was dub only and censored for the US. Finding uncensored Power Stone is hard.
[3:28:05] <kei_ar_> is this even on a fightcade or anything like that?
[3:28:12] <damienlunas> Tekkaman Blade's QCB-Attack is the ultimate noobtrap
[3:28:23] <GeltonZ> @kei_ar_ Dolphin has online play and there is an online scene/Discord.
[3:28:26] <%jinking79> no one did
[3:28:31] <stevo_scar> Falcon's thirst for Valgas was a character in itself
[3:28:44] <%SuperKirby24> @GeltonZ ...uncensored Power Stone? Kappa
[3:28:52] <%LordSDB> Does Woolie know how to do Kara special after he spins his blade?
[3:29:09] <GeltonZ> @SuperKirby24 Yes. You think I'm watching the show for anything other than the hype themesong and Rouge?
[3:29:09] <kazadog> man I got this game just cause of tekkaman blade I dont even care that much about fighting games
[3:29:09] <Super_Voltekka> They removed Rouge's crack, didn't they?
[3:29:12] <%FuqBoiSlim> why is twitch tryna get me to listen to the new logic album
[3:29:21] <damienlunas> Karas is so bad in this version of the game because they over-nerfed him from last game
[3:29:41] <GeltonZ> @Super_Voltekka The character designs for the anime were toned down in general but I know there were at least some cut lewd closeups.
[3:29:52] <stevo_scar> Oh yea, Logic is not a twitch streamer right
[3:29:55] <stevo_scar> now*
[3:30:08] <GeltonZ> @Super_Voltekka Look up the Japanese opening theme though it is hype as fuck...but I like eurobeat so...
[3:30:40] <%SuperKirby24> @GeltonZ Oh, lewd censorship. I thought there was some violent shit going on in Power Stone Kappa
[3:30:51] <BlackermanZX> i forgot if this game got rid of the character themes completely
[3:30:58] <%SomersaultJustice> can you end that with the air grab super?
[3:31:06] <%SomersaultJustice> YEYEYEYEYE
[3:31:20] <+haitahaita> Man this game is SO CASH
[3:31:22] <%paladinstarbuster> DRILLED
[3:31:31] <GeltonZ> @SuperKirby24 Maybe somewhere in there? Haven't seen too far in but I bet Vargas might have some body horror. I just know what I care about XD
[3:31:32] <BlackermanZX> i liked volnutt's theme in TVC
[3:31:40] <damienlunas> My fave teams are Polimar x Tekkaman or Ryu x Tekkaman
[3:31:56] <%LordSDB> Karas is still b tier at the least
[3:32:05] <kei_ar_> reggie got the opening cutscene combo
[3:32:10] <Super_Voltekka> The Tekkamen together are a great team themselves
[3:32:10] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1285426733492166656?s=20
[3:32:11] <KnivesEve> the bridge breaks after a certain time doesnt?
[3:32:14] <kazadog> tekkaman blade +tekkaman classic
[3:32:21] <%SomersaultJustice> hyper bomb!
[3:32:37] <damienlunas> Hyper Bomb is like Frame 0 after the super flash right
[3:32:44] <chocolatebar_cb> i need to watch casshan, and then cassern sins
[3:32:49] <Super_Voltekka> There's a great combo video on Niconico that shows off a triple Voltekka combo with both of them
[3:32:57] <%LordSDB> Karas x Soki, tekkeman blade x anyone and ryu x anyone
[3:33:11] <damienlunas> IIRC if you are holding jump during the Super Flash of Hyper Bomb, you'll still get hit
[3:33:14] <crimsonsaens> My favorite team is Ken X Zero
[3:33:31] <%Wool> I was a pretty well known Frank/Roll player back in the day
[3:33:44] <damienlunas> Oh yeah Soki is fucking great, I love how he can just jab you from half a mile away

[3:40:04] <Super_Voltekka> Do a hyper while the soldiers are on screen
[3:40:06] <BlackermanZX> not a big fan of stage themes instead of character themes but this BOPS
[3:40:14] <odd_slater> Do you think you're better of aloooneeee?
[3:40:14] <crimsonsaens> Reggie is just playing Megaman
[3:40:37] <+xerotwo> ZA WARUDO
[3:40:43] <Axle13j> That was hype
[3:40:46] <%Wool> What a better level 3 than UMVC3
[3:41:03] <Super_Voltekka> Fuck OSDO
[3:41:06] <%LordSDB> Have they seen Zero Lv 3 in this?
[3:41:07] <%Solidnick18> so sickkkkk
[3:41:08] <chocolatebar_cb> could be a yellow devil
[3:41:10] <anarchistPastry> aint there an old nightcore song that sounds just like this
[3:41:14] <%Wool> @LordSDB they literally just did it
[3:41:16] <BlackermanZX> Zero's lvl3 in this game is amazing
[3:41:16] <kei_ar_> ZA WORLDO
[3:41:16] <Super_Voltekka> They just did it
[3:41:24] <NeroInfinite> Meganutt
[3:41:29] <chocolatebar_cb> @anarchistPastry its got like, motifs of it
[3:41:32] <%LordSDB> @Wool Sorry I just missed it ; . ;
[3:41:45] <%Wool> DO THE CHAINGRAB
[3:41:53] <crimsonsaens> MvC3's Zero lv3 is better, but TvC's Zero lv3 is so much more stylish
[3:41:56] <anarchistPastry> what song though, its on the tip of my tongue
[3:42:08] <%SirGO0SE> need the darude sandstorm remix of this track
[3:42:20] <%Solidnick18> lo
[3:42:25] <crimsonsaens> @anarchistPastry It's the stage theme, Orbital ring
[3:42:31] <%Solidnick18> oof
[3:42:47] <%SirGO0SE> and i think youre thinking of better off alone
[3:42:49] <%SomersaultJustice> LUL

[3:43:08] <crimsonsaens> Why are Woolie's sets best of 2?
[3:43:12] <%Solidnick18> YES
[3:43:25] <anarchistPastry> its "Better Off Alone"
[3:43:30] <+RowenCleric> they just need to cross Lost Planet with Monster Hunter or something
[3:43:30] <Super_Voltekka> woolieYE woolieYE
[3:43:35] <anarchistPastry> thats what Orbital Ring stage theme reminds me of
[3:43:40] <damienlunas> YEYEYE OG TEKKAMAN
[3:43:42] <%SirGO0SE> yeah thought so
[3:43:44] <odd_slater> Who did that Chun Li art?
[3:44:01] <+xerotwo> Shinkiro
[3:44:03] <kei_ar_> shinkiro did all the art for this game
[3:44:04] <GeltonZ> @anarchistPastry Oh wow you're right!
[3:44:05] <%SomersaultJustice> chun looks like she's caressing her partner's face in that art
[3:44:19] <%The_Minotaur> Tekkaman got that Dark Souls 2 Twinblade build
[3:44:24] <odd_slater> Yeah ok I remember
[3:44:26] <DragonSpooker> Go meh neh
[3:44:34] <odd_slater> @SomersaultJustice 😳
[3:44:53] <Super_Voltekka> It sucks there was never an official crossover between the two Tekkamen in any anime
[3:44:55] <damienlunas> it was crazy for me hearing on the podcast how much Woolie loves Shinkiro's art, because when I was a kid I was always like "Aww man, I got the BAD artwork of Rock" when I played CvS2
[3:45:08] <Super_Voltekka> Maybe if they ever make Infini-T Force Season 2
