[0:15:10] <%Atomik456> Atomik456 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months, currently on a 6 month streak! I saw Shazam with a bunch of workmates after a drinking lunch, in some tiny rathole cinema in an office tower. It was great. REally felt like an time displaced 80s/90s movie. In a good way not a nostalgia bait way.

[0:17:47] <countgaculatv> Even without Nightwing Bludhaven is crazy
[0:17:48] <prime_name> I wonder if we'll see another Evil Superman

[0:19:23] <%ringabal> WAIT THAT'S STATIC SHOCK?
[0:19:24] <Daba_mk2> Static Shock is where is at tho
[0:19:27] <bearwagon> you've never had black lightning before
[0:19:27] <%chll0ne> @panicswytch facts
[0:19:33] <+projectmanatees> all i can think of is the harvey bird man bit with him
[0:19:36] <+Deadpool2450> YALL FORGOT STATIC SHOCK
[0:19:36] <%laserbeaming> Static Shock FTW
[0:19:37] <+Chronobot> LIES and SLANDER
[0:19:37] <judgefudge9> Last night I saw a superhero. HE WAS BLACK
[0:19:37] <%Prevot> less interesting static shock
[0:19:38] <+TopTierHarley> he was in Super friends
[0:19:39] <+DesertPenguin> Was he before or after Like Cage?
[0:19:43] <+TopTierHarley> As Black Vulcan
[0:19:45] <Dante_Namikaze1> Black Lightning is the only CW Superhero show that hasn't had a bad season
[0:19:45] <spidervenomized> @daba_mk2 not dc
[0:19:53] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Blightning
[0:19:54] <dromemer3> "im imune to lightning" you never had black lightning before"
[0:19:54] <%RioGascar> i‚Äôve heard the metallica song black lightning
[0:19:54] <+chosenjuan42> How many black heroes have electric powers?
[0:19:56] <youthgonewild77> Static is diff ownership
[0:20:01] <Dante_Namikaze1> He's a principle now
[0:20:01] <aigriot970> i prefer static shock and the bangbabys
[0:20:03] <bunnyscruff> Bro I need that Static Shock cartoon to come back
[0:20:05] <countgaculatv> About 5
[0:20:05] <%masterfire23> when is icon getting his own series
[0:20:09] <LtSurge> Static grows up to take on the mantle of Black Lightning when this one dies
[0:20:13] <%chll0ne> @projectmanatees white fish LUL
[0:20:14] <+kekkerscrew> Black Lightning's Kids " Thunder, and Lightning " are so effing cool.
[0:20:16] <digaogrunge> @WoolieVersus I was wondering if you have a take on why black superheroes often have lightning powers?
[0:20:25] <andre11dr> Remember when Louis Lain became black and then Superman didn't love here anymore? The good old 60s LUL
[0:20:26] <+mattwillpost> Still waiting for Hellblazer to be done right.
[0:20:27] <+victhebeard> he's was in the "urban" areas
[0:20:31] <+chosenjuan42> Darktropolis
[0:20:32] <yusefHD> Static Shock will probably be the only reason I consider that DC subscription service tbh, need that show uprezzed
[0:20:34] <BreakersAweigh> man....everytime i see people refer to Static as Static Shock i die inside a little bit
[0:20:41] <Mr_216> Not every black hero has lightning powers smh
[0:20:43] <BalloniWright> Rocket is bae
[0:20:46] <+london_flexing> Static was diff ownership until the comics company went defunct. Static is DC now
[0:21:06] <+chosenjuan42> @breakersaweigh Static Shock is dope
[0:21:07] <derap41> like the phenomena ?
[0:21:10] <yusefHD> POG
[0:21:10] <+projectmanatees> @chll0ne he so should of sued the leauge
[0:21:12] <+wunp_fxs> I miss the static shock cartoon
[0:21:13] <+Kyoshikei> Static Shock was soooo good
[0:21:15] <goroke> Couple? It's been a decade...........
[0:21:16] <$RunningNGunning> Static Shock was dope
[0:21:16] <ElectricEmissary> superhero static shock woo woo
[0:21:17] <%masterfire23> vergil
[0:21:18] <+ennui_on_me> "a couple years ago"
[0:21:18] <Daba_mk2> ye ye ye
[0:21:18] <Dante_Namikaze1> Superman couldn't help out that area because there was a naturally occurring field around it that would shut off his powers
[0:21:22] <%Plus_On_Black> how?
[0:21:23] <digaogrunge> a couple 20 years ago
[0:21:23] <Retinolgaming> Static was dope
[0:21:25] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Like two years.
[0:21:28] <+Superbro64> S-S-STATIC STATIC SHOCL
[0:21:29] <$RunningNGunning> A couple decades ago
[0:21:30] <%chll0ne> reggie how LUL
[0:21:30] <+london_flexing> Static was a comic first iirc
[0:21:31] <+jiggy_snipe> Static was created by Milestone Comics
[0:21:31] <bunnyscruff> He puts a shock to your system
[0:21:32] <judgefudge9> Phil Lamar is GOAT
[0:21:33] <+chosenjuan42> Static Shock is a Vergil
[0:21:34] <BreakersAweigh> Static Shock was a great show
[0:21:35] <%DappercatEsquire> @Dante_Namikaze1 is that real? because that's super dumb
[0:21:36] <aigriot970> dwayne mcduffy. look him up.
[0:21:38] <+jiggy_snipe> DC owns him now tho
[0:21:41] <yusefHD> They're screening an episode of Static on Fandome right now @WoolieVersus
[0:21:41] <sunnythedrunk> Static shock was great
[0:21:42] <Joestar1890> Reggie never saw Static Shock? TIME FOR A MARATHON!
[0:21:46] <DonatelloJose> SS was my fucking jam. He was super cool.
[0:21:52] <BalloniWright> Oh yeah his name is Vergil right?
[0:21:54] <%chll0ne> rip dwayne mcduffy
[0:21:54] <TheShockVox> @chosenjuan42 Not even, son. Check yourself. He came, he‚Äôs more powerful, he‚Äôs nothing like Virgil because static‚Äôs power is electromagnetism based. BL is electrokinesis. He‚Äôs a former Olympic runner, he‚Äôs a teacher, he was a member of Batman‚Äôs Outsiders and JL member. Nothing like static except electricity and being black. Takes more than that
[0:22:01] <aigriot970> yes virgil
[0:22:02] <%M3djedx> woolieYE
[0:22:05] <prime_name> Static's Dad in the show was great
[0:22:06] <CyrusVGZ> DC doesn't own Static Shock. They pay to use him.
[0:22:07] <judgefudge9> No their not related, your just racist
[0:22:09] <yusefHD> Update that epsiode has a 502 bad gateway LUL
[0:22:09] <+Superbro64> Static Shock animated series tackled heavy issues such as racism doodGood
[0:22:10] <Twoiis> Had a crossover with Batman Beyond.
[0:22:10] <coldfire0007> And very similar costumes
[0:22:20] <kainsonofdeath> have they seen anything yet?
[0:22:20] <+kekkerscrew> Static doesn't have Lightning powers. Static has Magnetic powers.
[0:22:23] <weissguard> Virgil Hawkins, yeyeye
[0:22:26] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Black Superheroes with Skateboard Powers
[0:22:31] <+mattwillpost> It‚Äôs like when everyone thinks all black people in Star Wars are related lmao
[0:22:31] <countgaculatv> He can control electro magnetic waves
[0:22:31] <+kewlmyc> Is her motivated, tho?
[0:22:33] <Iwashi94> Miles also uses electricity no?
[0:22:34] <Dante_Namikaze1> No he wasn't it's just Black people getting electricity powers is kinda of common thing
[0:22:35] <yusefHD> Static vs Magneto Death Battle when
[0:22:48] <+Superbro64> electromagnetism goes hand in hand @kekkerscrew
[0:22:48] <+Dova573> memeber when an episode of static shock dealt with a school shooting?
[0:22:52] <+Dova573> I member
[0:22:56] <yusefHD> I memba
[0:22:58] <%chll0ne> lmao miles morales has electricity as well
[0:23:00] <heart_ablaze> I heard 3 jokers is actually pretty good
[0:23:00] <+ultimatetotoro> when's Icon
[0:23:02] <dromemer3> oh no....
[0:23:03] <%masterfire23> ngl the best part of the black lightning tv show is thunders ass
[0:23:04] <Joestar1890> @superbro64 also drugs, gang violence, school shootings, etc.
[0:23:04] <CyrusVGZ> Static, Black Lightning, Storm, Yoruichi from Bleach etc
[0:23:05] <prime_name> Oh geez this thing
[0:23:07] <Edjager97> static Shock was one of the only cartoons that handled serious issues such as gun violence and racism very well
[0:23:08] <Daba_mk2> oof
[0:23:08] <yusefHD> Make sure the video plays LUL
[0:23:09] <+sumohype> Cool
[0:23:10] <TheShockVox> @superbro64 Or homelessness, bullying, school shooting, doping in sports, entitlement, gang mentality and pressure, etc
[0:23:11] <%Solidnick18> that's the newest comicright?

[0:23:53] <heart_ablaze> the clown, the criminal, and the comedian
[0:23:58] <kainsonofdeath> 3 jokers and its implied there are more in the first issue
[0:24:09] <+TheDankDemon> LUL hahaha
[0:24:14] <%laserbeaming> I like Beyond Muscle Joker
[0:24:14] <+kewlmyc> Wasn't he an actual God at one point?
[0:24:27] <PanicSwytch> The Mobius Chair changed everything
[0:24:29] <bearwagon> so that gamer meme was accurate
[0:24:30] <+jessedouglas> Just came in. Hello! What‚Äôs going on?
[0:24:31] <countgaculatv> And then there‚Äôs the Batman who Laughs
[0:24:33] <+DesertPenguin> So dumb
[0:24:33] <TheShockVox> Remember when he went to Africa and touched on the different perspective of being somewhere where you‚Äôre not considered a black kid, but just a kid?
[0:24:38] <Klefth> Kefka?
[0:24:39] <%sleepofgiants> i don't read comics. who's batman?

[0:25:05] <+ennui_on_me> prometheus
[0:25:06] <prime_name> What about the best joker, The Batman Who Laughs?
[0:25:06] <+DesertPenguin> What the fuck?
[0:25:08] <%marrs_bars> "It's just called two brothers!"
[0:25:08] <spidervenomized> Prometheus
[0:25:09] <+hootdoot> Yes, that's Prometheus
[0:25:09] <wibbwobbler> joker himself said he preferres his origin to be multiple choice
[0:25:11] <ElectricEmissary> prometheus had his guts picked out yeah
[0:25:12] <sunnythedrunk> Maxi Zeus? Kappa
[0:25:13] <+kekkerscrew> He tricks Mr Mxyspitlic into giving him 99% of his powers as a bet
[0:25:14] <%NeedlesD> It was Prometheus
[0:25:15] <+ArtemisCroc> prometheus pushes the boulder
[0:25:16] <+ennui_on_me> Prometheus had his guts eaten every day
[0:25:18] <+jiggy_snipe> that was his punishment
[0:25:18] <%R3Roundabout> That is Prometheus
[0:25:18] <TheShockVox> This book took like 3 years to come out
[0:25:23] <spidervenomized> yes it Prometheus
[0:25:24] <ElectricEmissary> sisyphus is the boulder
[0:25:24] <Daba_mk2> thats prometheus that was is punishment
[0:25:27] <%NeedlesD> @ArtemisCroc thats Sisyphus
[0:25:33] <kainsonofdeath> @countgaculatv a new one. Its implied the original joker keeps recruiting new jokers
[0:25:37] <extradopeness> Sisyphus pushes the boulder u goob
[0:25:38] <yusefHD> Prometheus gets his back blown out every night, and isn't allowed to wash up afterward. Tragic.
[0:25:44] <+ArtemisCroc> wait yeah I got it backwards
[0:25:48] <+DesertPenguin> Gangster
[0:25:57] <+Dova573> hes a smoker, a midnight toker
[0:25:59] <Klefth> So what's this stream about?
[0:26:03] <spidervenomized> 30 -40s
[0:26:03] <shadowstreakXIII> sisyphus is the rock push
[0:26:05] <+DesertPenguin> Gangster then Clown
[0:26:16] <countgaculatv> @kainsonofdeath that‚Äôs weird. He talked as if he was very self aware of who Dick was before he turned him into Dicky Boy
[0:26:17] <Loinclothiclese> @Klefth dc fandome
[0:26:18] <%FuqBoiSlim> Remember when Joker cannibalized the population of China by putting them in giant takeout ü•° boxes?
[0:26:21] <Applecannon63> Tim Burton's Joker was a gangster
[0:26:25] <%paladinstarbuster> jokers boner
[0:26:29] <+jiggy_snipe> WHAT
[0:26:29] <+ArtemisCroc> silver age joker is hilarious but totally non threatening
[0:26:32] <Dave_VD> Joker is wack. It's all about the Designer these days
[0:26:34] <shadowstreakXIII> yup
[0:26:38] <%Shardlab> The Comics Code Authority
[0:26:38] <+Rekinsinn> WutFace
[0:26:38] <TheShockVox> Prometheus is also a DC villain, known for helping the destruction of Star city, cutting off Red Arrow‚Äôs arm, and killing his daughter. He was then killed by Green Arrow in retaliation and GA was arrested and banished
[0:26:39] <judgefudge9> Same with D&D
[0:26:39] <+jiggy_snipe> People blaming media for stuff
[0:26:40] <spidervenomized> fuck the comic book authority
[0:26:43] <bunnyscruff> I thought it was far more interesting that there's no true Joker backstory and that he's sorta just the Joker, now they're trying to explain it and make it far less interesting and are saying oh there's three now
[0:26:46] <%Solidnick18> oh wow
[0:26:47] <countgaculatv> Bruh when‚Äôs Midnighter?
[0:26:51] <+jiggy_snipe> shocking Kappa
[0:26:54] <sunnythedrunk> We've come a long way from that to now knowing Batman's dick size
[0:26:59] <prime_name> The Satanic Panic for Comics
[0:27:16] <judgefudge9> Boomers sure do love passing the blame on nerd stuff
[0:27:17] <Joestar1890> To be fair, they had to censor or go out of business
[0:27:20] <%Shardlab> The comic industries elsewhere got to grow and warp, evolve. The US comics scene got to stagnate horribly
[0:27:28] <+kewlmyc> "Lex stole 40 pies, and that's awful"
[0:27:29] <heart_ablaze> running across giant typewriters
[0:27:36] <%Shardlab> Took until the 80's and 90's for things to change
[0:27:38] <PanicSwytch> Yes
[0:27:41] <+gustavozxd> oh wow lmao
[0:27:46] <heart_ablaze> yes
[0:27:47] <%FuqBoiSlim> is that why everything was just corny superhero shit for a long time?
[0:27:49] <countgaculatv> Yes
[0:27:49] <+TheDankDemon> leto joker is still a bigger clown
[0:27:53] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Now we have Joker with skin masks
[0:27:54] <judgefudge9> This is just a podcast now
[0:27:56] <+gustavozxd> that's a wild 180
[0:27:57] <%Shardlab> Until the Big Two threw away the CCA
[0:28:04] <spidervenomized> it golden age, killing joke, and death in the family joker
[0:28:06] <%Solidnick18> yes
[0:28:11] <PanicSwytch> After The killing joke, joker became brutal
[0:28:21] <Joestar1890> I thought it was the it's the 70's when the Comics Code was abolished?
[0:28:22] <DonatelloJose> One. Bad. Day.
[0:28:33] <PanicSwytch> He did more than paralyze her
[0:28:38] <kainsonofdeath> @countgaculatv well the story is a black label book wich means its not affected by events like the joker war. But the clown dies in the first issue and the other have very specific traits that the one in joker war doesnt. And since they talk abou making more jokers beside the titular 3, its the only option. Unless they reveal something in the next issues
[0:28:39] <Rav_Rabies> joker's five way revenge was earlier and he was a psychopath in that
[0:28:41] <heart_ablaze> in the killing joke, it starts with a short story of how the old goofy batman is pretty much dead
[0:28:42] <+Qsmash_> 80s were the beginning of edge
[0:28:42] <countgaculatv> Bruh he went hard in the paint when it came to the Batfamily
[0:28:43] <%FuqBoiSlim> Based Alan Moore?
[0:28:48] <+donpatrondx> bring back old joker
[0:28:53] <Dante_Namikaze1> There's a reason why Barbra shows up in a wheelchair
[0:28:57] <HollowMan190> Gordan girly legs no feely
[0:28:59] <bunnyscruff> Joker being 3 people is so dumb
[0:28:59] <%chll0ne> funny how alan moore hates that story now
[0:29:01] <%Shardlab> I wouldn't say it was abolished, just that they publishers started doing stories without the CCA on their books and the world didn't end
[0:29:07] <spidervenomized> @joestar1890 around the 80s but not completely abolished
[0:29:10] <prime_name> Oh Joy, Frank...
[0:29:11] <+ennui_on_me> @Joestar1890 no, the CCA continued on; Alan Moore's Swamp Thing is the first DC comic not under it, and that was because it wasn't published on newsstands.
[0:29:26] <Joestar1890> ahh ok
[0:29:32] <%Shardlab> When there was no backlash, the stories began to mature
[0:29:35] <+gustavozxd> I found out about the harley quinn consoles today
[0:29:35] <%chll0ne> just like the movie PogChamp
[0:29:40] <heart_ablaze> yes it does
[0:29:41] <%Solidnick18> shhh
[0:29:44] <Alexgonzsalsaboy> Its why she's Oracle in the Arkham games
[0:29:45] <countgaculatv> @kainsonofdeath I mean which Joker currently has Punchline recruited? The already dead one?
[0:29:51] <centuronstar> Issue 1 of the Three Jokers is already out. Its pretty interesting
[0:29:52] <+Dova573> Is all the joker force, the power that all jokers tap into to laugh super hard Kappa
[0:29:53] <spidervenomized> the first issue just came out
[0:29:59] <Malik1002> I wonder how the silver age one is going to work compared to the other two
[0:30:00] <%chll0ne> speaking of... the harley quinn show is great
[0:30:03] <+TheDankDemon> WutFace 3rd

[0:30:48] <countgaculatv> It took Batman a mobius chair to find out there‚Äôs more than one Joker lol
[0:30:50] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Anyone play DC Infinite Crisis? That game had a bunch of jokers

[0:31:31] <Edjager97> POWER OF GUN ANNIHILATES ALL
[0:31:32] <+Story_Ark> Are they gonna have 3 Jokers in Injustice 3?
[0:31:34] <%FuqBoiSlim> MORE LIKE GEOFF YAWNS
[0:31:34] <NewWillinium> Jason Todd and the Power of Anti-Villain/Hero
[0:31:42] <Azathotic> @RioGascar Prob autofocus, maybe he has Marvel stuff there
[0:31:51] <countgaculatv> @kainsonofdeath I thought Nightwing 74 was explicit in saying it ties into Joker War
[0:31:52] <certainhijinks> so the fist issue came out and oh boi does Jason have G U N
[0:31:56] <%insomniacCoder> what is this event?
[0:31:58] <+Chronobot> Yo guns are pretty SICK
[0:31:59] <Dante_Namikaze1> Jason only kills when he's doing solo stuff when working with the Bat-Family he does nonlethal stuff
[0:32:03] <Loinclothiclese> @insomniacCoder dc fandome
[0:32:03] <+mckraven> well Jason did die and get forcefully ressurected. thats a bit harder to heal from
[0:32:05] <ZeeJiggle> I hate how much of a sucker I am for Red Hoods designs
[0:32:11] <+borat210> That first issue of Three Jokers was really good
[0:32:13] <bunnyscruff> Jason healed wrong my dick, he started capping motherfuckers I'd say that's good
[0:32:14] <+stephaniesadgirl> Jason Todd uses guns, hes hard core, still doesn't kill Joker
[0:32:19] <Loinclothiclese> @insomniacCoder big logo on screen lol
[0:32:20] <+Story_Ark> Barbara: i will heal and become Batgirl again. jason: G U N
[0:32:26] <heart_ablaze> @stephaniesadgirl ....
[0:32:26] <%chll0ne> LUL @bunnyscruff
[0:32:30] <Azathotic> Excuse you, Jason got resurrected by the power of PUNCH
[0:32:31] <+jiggy_snipe> Jason is the problem solver unlike Bruce
[0:32:31] <+ManOfReason> Red hood so edgy but I love it
[0:32:34] <NewWillinium> I think he keeps trying to kill the Joker but someone always stops him. Because Joker
[0:32:34] <+ygernesfeld> Are they blurring his non DC comics & figures?
[0:32:39] <judgefudge9> Remember when Jason Todd shoved a lit flare up a criminals ass?
[0:32:41] <+borat210> Jason >>>>>> other Robins
[0:32:44] <+jessedouglas> Jason ‚ÄúBig Gun‚Äù Todd
[0:32:45] <kainsonofdeath> @countgaculatv read my replys again. Joker war and the 3 jokers story are different books
[0:32:45] <+Story_Ark> Man i feel bad that i dropped batman comics since i used to love them. stopped when damian died, maybe ill go back one day
[0:32:47] <brunoberserk> jason : so anyway , i start blasting
[0:32:49] <+ennui_on_me> I'm guessing those are non-DC things yeah
[0:32:51] <%FuqBoiSlim> @judgefudge9 when was this???
[0:32:57] <collind99> Batman is more interesting when he doesn‚Äôt kill
[0:33:01] <ZeeJiggle> Oh man they're totally blurring non-DC stuff.. That's a Wolverine figure at least.
[0:33:03] <+mckraven> @borat210 nah Dick still the best
[0:33:13] <BreakersAweigh> how dare you have OTHER figures
[0:33:18] <judgefudge9> It was in the Red hood:Outlaw run
[0:33:20] <WarCityVillain> jason got 1 joker already
[0:33:21] <%insomniacCoder> @Loinclothiclese the gothan knights game? or dc comics related?
[0:33:22] <+Story_Ark> Woolie the difference is theres multiple Jokers in the same universe, where the movies are different universes
[0:33:25] <countgaculatv> @kainsonofdeath ah ok I was confused
[0:33:35] <collind99> Multiverse
[0:33:48] <%FuqBoiSlim> @judgefudge9 lemme add that to my read later list
[0:33:49] <%optimasmaximas> optimasmaximas subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months, currently on a 9 month streak! 9 months, cheers
[0:33:50] <NewWillinium> I think the last Batman/Red Hood thing I read was. . . ."Death in the Family"? With Joker wearing his own sliced off face? It was really REALLY dumb
[0:33:57] <%chll0ne> wow did dc tell woolie to move his figures LUL
[0:34:08] <+seduwu> Tim deserves more love
[0:34:14] <princegeo> red hood and the outlaws are a good read
[0:34:17] <brunoberserk> woolie , tell us how much you love joker ...
[0:34:20] <Loinclothiclese> @insomniacCoder its a dc event its not just about the games lol its everything they got to show

[0:34:27] <collind99> They recently fucked over Damian in the comics
[0:34:30] <%FuqBoiSlim> The Faceless Joker Arc is something I wanna know more about I feel like I'll be disappointed when I do
[0:34:30] <prime_name> Wasn't the latest Joker an immortal caveman or something?
[0:34:38] <wibbwobbler> 3 jokers and court of owls is cool, make batman look like a dummy tho
[0:34:39] <countgaculatv> @newwillinium Red Hood as been with Batfamily multiple times since. Like when Dick Grayson took a bullet to the brain
[0:34:40] <Alexgonzsalsaboy> Im da joker babybee
[0:34:44] <phatmac16> When haven‚Äôt comics fucked someone over?
[0:34:47] <spidervenomized> @princegeo the 2017 is the best run
[0:34:51] <Edjager97> @prime_name That's Vandal Savage
[0:34:59] <NewWillinium> @countgaculatv Didn't Dick Grayson become Batman Beyond replacing Terry just recently?
[0:35:03] <+mckraven> @newwillinium Death in the family is the one where Jason died. Death of the family is the one with jokers sliced off face.
[0:35:10] <NewWillinium> Ahhhhh
[0:35:11] <+stephaniesadgirl> Anyone else getting alot of stuttering on the stream?
[0:35:17] <ZeeJiggle> T-Shirt Joker
[0:35:18] <collind99> No that was Tim that replaced terry years ago
[0:35:21] <heart_ablaze> @fuqboislim as far as I know, it was just for shock value
[0:35:22] <@Menitta> Arthur Fleck turned himself in to the authorities he is now serving a life sentence

[0:35:23] <Loinclothiclese> @stephaniesadgirl nope

[0:35:30] <phatmac16> GANGWEED
[0:35:31] <Daxalog> Thats Meta Joker.

[0:35:57] <%optimasmaximas> oh?
[0:35:59] <alexandrecau> Cult is a really good one
[0:36:19] <@Menitta> it makes me sad that my only exposure to DC is the Arkham games and then I learn Deathstroke kinda sucks
[0:36:21] <Casinoroyale80> CULT is legendary
[0:36:23] <phatmac16> how about we give the Joker a break?
[0:36:25] <@Menitta> BUT HES SO COOL
[0:36:27] <Edjager97> @prime_name just looked it up, apparently they did. he was exposed to the same meteorite that Savage was.
[0:36:28] <gade177> Joker's overused at this point imo.
[0:36:30] <+kewlmyc> Heath Ledger or Mark Hamill
[0:36:34] <brunoberserk> Jason '' i hate crowbars'' Todd
[0:36:34] <spidervenomized> the cult when batman trip ball
[0:36:41] <%optimasmaximas> @Menitta he sucks in arkham
[0:36:41] <phatmac16> Nichaleson Joker is the best
[0:36:42] <judgefudge9> Mark hamil ftw
[0:36:42] <NewWillinium> Can we start Hyping up Two-Face instead of Joker?
[0:36:42] <+RealThiele> why is anyone expecting the new arkham game to be good after tank batman in the last one?
[0:36:42] <+seduwu> Mark Hamill east
[0:36:48] <+Story_Ark> Can DC use Joker more? i feel hes kinda underrated and underused
[0:36:53] <ThighsSupreme> Return of joker is some good stuff
[0:36:54] <Alexgonzsalsaboy> Woolie still needs to play the Arkham games..
[0:36:57] <phatmac16> Two-face needs more love

[0:37:13] <+seduwu> @realthiele different devs

[0:37:17] <judgefudge9> When‚Äôs the Arkham asylum LP?
[0:37:22] <PanicSwytch> The reason why Joker is so great is becuz he's unpredictable. Everything is chaos

[0:37:34] <prime_name> Will Catwoman be allowed to marry Batman this time?
[0:37:35] <sunnythedrunk> I really wanna see Hush or Killer Croc in a Batman movie
[0:37:35] <judgefudge9> Hush is the shit
[0:37:35] <NewWillinium> Also. . . It's odd but Return of Joker's censored version feels darker then the uncensored version. It makes me want to mix and match the two versions for the best effect
[0:37:36] <%chll0ne> hush is goat PogChamp
[0:37:37] <+Story_Ark> court of owls is great

[0:38:04] <+ArtemisCroc> year one was really cool
[0:38:04] <+Story_Ark> Long Halloween and Year One are great too
[0:38:07] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> We wanted it to feel like the old thing, but new.
[0:38:09] <andre11dr> So hush is where the moneys at huh?
[0:38:10] <prime_name> WHY JOKER SHARK
[0:38:11] <+seduwu> Year One hits tho
[0:38:11] <+BananaSlammuh> Hush is solid but the art really is the huge draw
[0:38:12] <NewWillinium> . . Have Jason or Slade ever interacted? The Mask in the background confused me for half a second.
[0:38:13] <Dante_Namikaze1> Hush is good but the ending fucking sucks
[0:38:14] <brunoberserk> check out comic hush , but for the love the god don't see the animated movie hush
[0:38:16] <+kekkerscrew> And the new movie is based on Batman Year Two
[0:38:17] <heart_ablaze> *joker
[0:38:23] <spidervenomized> year two is good to

[0:38:34] <judgefudge9> The DC animated movie is awesome
[0:38:38] <collind99> @woolieversus read Batman Ego
[0:38:44] <Azathotic> @kekkerscrew Its not, if you mean the Year Two comic with jobber named The Reaper
[0:38:48] <judgefudge9> Bryan Cranston as Jim Gordon
[0:38:55] <phatmac16> Bane is the only person allowed to break his back thi
[0:38:58] <heart_ablaze> don't forget he also shits his pants
[0:38:59] <+Story_Ark> Knightfall is a good arc too
[0:39:01] <PanicSwytch> HUSH in the comics was great... The animated movie of HUSH sucks
[0:39:03] <+BananaSlammuh> Batman's back is constantly getting fked lol
[0:39:09] <kainsonofdeath> The first issue of the 3 jokers opens up with two pages showing batmans scars and how he got them. Incluing the the scar from banes backbreak for example
[0:39:11] <Alexgonzsalsaboy> Bryan Cranston would be a perfect Gordon irl too
[0:39:11] <+RealThiele> and no the bad arkham city games was done by rocksteady too
[0:39:15] <countgaculatv> Just like Nightwing‚Äôs shoulder
[0:39:15] <NewWillinium> . .Is Carmine Falcone even a *thing* anymore? Or any of the old Gotham Crime Families?
[0:39:16] <+seduwu> The reaper inspired the Phantasm so that‚Äôs cool
[0:39:30] <phatmac16> Falcone is gonna be in the movie no?
[0:39:31] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[0:39:32] <Alexgonzsalsaboy> Hey I like Arkham Origins lol

[0:39:38] <+Lolo27234> i wounder if there cencoring marvel and anime toys in his cam
[0:39:44] <countgaculatv> Falcone is gonna be in the new Batman movie
[0:39:50] <%FuqBoiSlim> Batman needs a fucking memory foam mattress or somthing idk how that dude sleeps with that fragile ass spine
[0:39:56] <collind99> Arkham Origins is the best in the series in terms of character writing
[0:39:57] <+chosenjuan42> So bane is just the balcony as a dude.
[0:39:59] <Artoo_The_Me> Gravity is the number one Batman villian
[0:40:13] <andre11dr> I always judge Batman by how much love the look Gotham itself gets
[0:40:19] <NewWillinium> Batman/Bruce's number one villain is his need for Therapy
[0:40:25] <phatmac16> Bane and breaking Batman‚Äôs back name a more iconic duo
[0:40:30] <BalloniWright> What is that statue behind the girl? Is it the girl from Sandman?
[0:40:31] <+chosenjuan42> Who has broken more bones? Bane or the balcony?
[0:40:35] <+gustavozxd> that's the best joker
[0:40:40] <GyroBrando> That Morpheus is so cool fuck
[0:40:42] <+Story_Ark> I dropped Batman comics around the death of Damian wayne arc, any good comics since then?
[0:40:45] <+mckraven> Batman's body is basically 90% scar tissue at this point.
[0:40:46] <+RealThiele> he was also in live action Guyver
[0:40:48] <+seduwu> BTAS Joker is the best one
[0:40:49] <+gustavozxd> mark hamil is the perfect joker voice
[0:40:51] <phatmac16> He‚Äôs the best
[0:40:52] <NewWillinium> . When Joker first showed up wasn't he just some weird One-Shot Clown Villain that Batman shot at?
[0:40:54] <kukstorm> Sound for woolie is really low
[0:40:55] <gade177> A fish?
[0:41:06] <Mr_Rakjo> Hamil voice is the best joker voice
[0:41:06] <Alexgonzsalsaboy> Yup, unbeatable
[0:41:13] <Daxalog> He was Cringe.
[0:41:24] <collind99> I feel like Pattinson could‚Äôve been a good Terry like 7 years ago. As he‚Äôs aged I get more of a Bruce vibe
[0:41:25] <Daxalog> Dont look at my Cringe
[0:41:28] <+seduwu> boo this man
[0:41:34] <phatmac16> Where is Gamer Joker?
[0:41:38] <RoldanDgr8> boo
[0:41:38] <Ashenik1> Woolie there is a video of Batman Arkham City where Mark Hamil talks about the game and there is a clip where you can see Mark actiing
[0:41:43] <+Captain_Aham> nope, dude actually had the animations watch him so they could use his physical moves into the characyer
[0:41:44] <+mckraven> @newwillinium joker died in his first appearance. he got stabbed by his own knife. He was so popular that they just said "nevermind he didn't die."
[0:41:45] <countgaculatv> When‚Äôs Boomer Joker?
[0:41:46] <gade177> Man I would interviews.
[0:41:48] <sunnythedrunk> It's hard to see anyone topping Hamil
[0:41:49] <gade177> hate
[0:41:50] <certainhijinks> mark Hamill is such a good VA he never repeats a laugh for Joker
[0:41:54] <Hyper_charger> he had a great voice in under the red hood

[0:42:35] <pibbleton> I like listening to Woolie and Reggie in my background, it's very soothing. Not so much with Minh though, because there's darkness in that man.

[0:42:41] <+gustavozxd> oh yeah that's a great joker

[0:42:42] <%FuqBoiSlim> THE JUICE IS LOOSE
[0:42:45] <+RealThiele> bruce could do a lot more with his money but as a billionaire he likes playing god
[0:42:48] <%chll0ne> @ygernesfeld its on the best friends channel
[0:42:51] <+Mkingston> @Alexgonzsalsaboy source?
[0:42:52] <MrPandastic> Wasn't Mark Hamill responsible for the creation of the modern Joker laugh?
[0:42:53] <GeneralHysterics> WHEN'S DEESEE
[0:42:56] <+jessedouglas> Telltale Batman was really really good
[0:42:56] <Edjager97> @ygernesfeld they did both seasons years ago
[0:42:57] <brunoberserk> bff joker
[0:42:58] <Hyper_charger> Harley is the abuser
[0:43:01] <collind99> Proto Joker
[0:43:03] <phatmac16> Telltale joker was surprisingly good
[0:43:03] <NewWillinium> And it's very much a thing where Joker is more interested in *Bruce* then Batman. Kind of like Harvey.
[0:43:12] <%Nekros4442> RIP Telltale
[0:43:13] <prime_name> *Was good with
[0:43:14] <+gustavozxd> telltale joker is fun
[0:43:17] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Infinite Crisis was a Moba with three jokers in 2013 RIP
[0:43:36] <judgefudge9> Batman is low key the best Telltale game
[0:43:38] <%eyezehuhh> Juice 5eva
[0:43:38] <+agarbagefox> One of Telltale's better games from a rough era lol
[0:43:39] <heart_ablaze> shows how good telltale can be when they gave a shit
[0:43:42] <GeneralHysterics> the JUICE is LLOSE
[0:43:44] <countgaculatv> Remember there‚Äôs two Jokers in Gotham Kappa
[0:43:49] <madogod> what they watching?
[0:43:50] <phatmac16> MOBA JOKER
[0:43:51] <andre11dr> @pibbleton Do you really think a man with a bright soul could win Dokapon
[0:43:57] <+jessedouglas> The Joker from the Gotham tv series is sooooo fucking good! Top 5 easy!
[0:43:57] <Loinclothiclese> @madogod dc fandome
[0:44:00] <NewWillinium> Has anyone taken up Telltale's mantle of game style yet?
[0:44:03] <gade177> This interviewer is a little cringe.
[0:44:04] <phatmac16> and making fun of Catwoman
[0:44:05] <%Solidnick18> nice
[0:44:11] <brunoberserk> killing joke joker looks super evil
[0:44:14] <HotBloodedHero> Telltale's Batman was influenced by your guys' lp
[0:44:19] <+gustavozxd> seems like this 3 jokers thing is gonna be cool actually
[0:44:24] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Pour one out for Infinite Crisis, a MOBA that failed
[0:44:25] <kainsonofdeath> The question is: wich one of the 3 jokers is the one who cut his face off?
[0:44:28] <%FuqBoiSlim> @hotbloodedhero [GRAPPLE AWAY]
[0:44:31] <gade177> @NewWillinium The guys who r making A Wolf Among Us 2 seemed 2 be.
[0:44:34] <+Story_Ark> Joker has a Red Hood costume in one of the Injustice games
[0:44:37] <+RealThiele> pour one out for another failed MOBA
[0:44:51] <%eyezehuhh> @kainsonofdeath that did happen didn't it!

[0:45:11] <+chosenjuan42> they cowarded it out from Barbara being paralyzed but then again Batman healed from bane
[0:45:12] <collind99> @woolieversus you should read Batman ego, it‚Äôs a comic that doesn‚Äôt get name dropped by a ton of people but it‚Äôs one of the best issues ever written imo
[0:45:19] <%marrs_bars> *Grapple away from the Joker*
[0:45:21] <marcd1907> RedHood was a gang that found a new member every crime tlo wear the red helmet and pose as the leader so the Cops would go after them and Pre Joker was one of these guys
[0:45:26] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Cowards weren't ready for a playable Starro
[0:45:32] <heart_ablaze> @judgefudge9 thought the concept was interesting, thats about it...

[0:47:22] <Artoo_The_Me> You haven‚Äôt watched Death Note?!
[0:47:23] <Edjager97> @WoolieVersus can we get a watch party with reggie just wathing the dark knight animated movies?
[0:47:23] <+Mkingston> Then they can put Phoenix and Leto together.
[0:47:23] <prime_name> Isn't that the ongoing problem with comics?
[0:47:25] <KeiganOfAstora> As in on-going
[0:47:28] <phatmac16> Warner bros should SPONSERED him to play the Arkham games
[0:47:34] <%Solidnick18> shazam
[0:47:35] <collind99> Is it a hot take to prefer Arkham origins‚Äô story to city
[0:47:36] <+Captain_Aham> @woolieversus Mark Hammil actually had the animators watch him preform because he would get so into it, they could use his motions for the actual animations
[0:47:37] <+Story_Ark> Hey chat, anything interesting shown off yet today?
[0:47:37] <+RealThiele> shazam was better than it had any right to be

[0:47:52] <NewWillinium> The Rock is still slated to be Black Adam right?
[0:47:53] <Syrushmx> i think the joker is a metahuman or immortal concept like IT that every time he reinvents himself, he split

[0:48:39] <phatmac16> LUL
[0:48:41] <judgefudge9> I loved Chuck back in the day

[0:48:57] <marcd1907> i liked this flick quite a bit but the muscle suit could have looked better
[0:48:58] <pokyme> i like the black guy to the left
[0:48:59] <collind99> @mckraven Shazam is a better name unironically
[0:49:02] <phatmac16> The mother bit was real man
[0:49:10] <+chosenjuan42> Go hard on the dumb comic stuff
[0:49:11] <+Dr_DangerPhD> that spiderman 1 scene where he's figuring out how to shoot web is still pretty good lol
[0:49:13] <+InfiniteAverage> those fake muscles look crazy
[0:49:14] <+chosenjuan42> it's all good
[0:49:15] <+Mkingston> I was getting those joke back with The Tick cartoon
[0:49:16] <KeiganOfAstora> In the comics they made sense because people have been reading comics but with movies being new you had to establish that peopl were watching the movies before making the jokes
[0:49:17] <TheShockVox> Just uh...just a reminder he uh...he thought the movie was ‚Äúass‚Äù
[0:49:17] <Joestar1890> I wonder if Mystery Men aged better because of that

[0:49:39] <+professormorrigan> shazam was p mediocre
[0:49:40] <KeiganOfAstora> Horror and Comedy have a lot in common
[0:49:40] <phatmac16> Tick is great
[0:49:41] <NewWillinium> You could even sympathize with Dr Savola. Like. . .he got FUCKED as a kid. And then the Wizard did not help in that at all
[0:49:44] <+Story_Ark> Woolie didn't you think the movie sucked?
[0:49:47] <%eyezehuhh> sure LUL
[0:49:55] <+Takuatt> I can't believe you thought Captain Marvel was better than Shazam smh

[0:50:14] <KeiganOfAstora> I don't like the modern "social media" superhero stuff
[0:50:15] <%chll0ne> horror directors are the best ppl to make superhero movies
[0:50:15] <andre11dr> Woolie loves this movie

[0:52:12] <+jiggy_snipe> oh he was just playing himself? Kappa
[0:52:14] <marcd1907> Captains marvel's biggest problem as a character is she's incredibly self righteous but it's not seen as a bad flaw, make it a character flaw and it'll make her more likeable (at least in my opinion)
[0:52:16] <judgefudge9> Yo Jake, JAKE!!
[0:52:22] <%IzazaOzihaha> I loved the original Shazam movie, ignoring the fact that it's a bad movie.

[0:53:04] <+MechArch> What did I walk into?
[0:53:11] <collind99> This movie did have very Raimi vibes and I loved it. Spider Man 2 still best live action Spidey movie
[0:53:15] <heart_ablaze> @mecharch heaven
[0:53:22] <NewWillinium> Remember the Villain Monologue scene that is treated *super* realistically? That was great
[0:53:28] <bunnyscruff> Shazam was good but damn those monsters looked not good

[0:53:41] <CappuccinoGuil> It's a cloak turned into a cape
[0:53:42] <$JobbedBone> capelet?
[0:53:44] <phatmac16> The office bit was brutal too
[0:53:44] <+RealThiele> yea the monster cgi budget was definitely capped by WB
[0:53:53] <KeiganOfAstora> This is just the behind-the-scenes feature you'd get with DVD Special Features. This is stupid....
[0:53:56] <Chatterbox1991> half cape
[0:54:00] <+MechArch> @heart_ablaze fuck, I knew I was dead

[0:54:33] <+cvp5127> hes got moobs
[0:54:34] <judgefudge9> The wizard formally know as Shazam
[0:54:35] <yusefHD> "jeemon"
[0:54:37] <marcd1907> Shazam's cape looks like a nobleman cape from the renaissance
[0:54:38] <kainsonofdeath> Is there anything really new in this DC fandome thing?
[0:54:38] <KeiganOfAstora> Except they copied New52
[0:54:40] <princegeo> I want him to play a magical black man in a david cage game
[0:54:47] <Pillagius> Alex Ross is amazing
[0:54:50] <$silentblast93> so will the kid be in it?
[0:54:51] <KeiganOfAstora> Alex Ross is a god

[0:54:57] <+LazyAss24Seven> Whooo?
[0:54:58] <judgefudge9> Alex Ross is a genius
[0:55:01] <NewWillinium> That's! What looked to be missing from the costume! That little button across the vest!
[0:55:03] <+chosenjuan42> a e s t h e t I c
[0:55:04] <Potatoidea> Kingdom Come is excellent
[0:55:06] <%Solidnick18> huh

[0:55:08] <%FuqBoiSlim> Yeah I kinda liked the little shoulder cloak than just actual cape
[0:55:14] <KeiganOfAstora> I really miss the half-open chest thing
[0:55:15] <Hyper_charger> painting a comicbook
[0:55:17] <Goraka91> Zeus approves
[0:55:24] <+kekkerscrew> Atlas not Athena
[0:55:27] <NewWillinium> Wasn't it the Wisdom of Solomon?
[0:55:35] <marcd1907> Kingdom Come Shazam making Superman bleed

[0:55:56] <PanicSwytch> Fake Fan
[0:55:56] <NewWillinium> Was Solomon a god? I always thought it was like. . the Biblical Solomon
[0:55:59] <Potatoidea> Kingdom Come Shazam did a lot more than making him bleed monkaS
[0:56:01] <$JobbedBone> bowelsquad

[0:56:20] <BalloniWright> Kreygasm
[0:56:25] <andre11dr> Man ,religion is weird in DC and Marvel because some of the God's are straight real and you can talk to them
[0:56:29] <+kekkerscrew> Alex Ross Superman is modeled after his father
[0:56:35] <Dante_Namikaze1> they film most of the CW shows in Canada
[0:56:38] <%RioGascar> Toronto, the city that never gets to play itself
[0:56:39] <hamahiroyuki> the short cape is something to make him look more childish on purpouse since it's a kid in an adult body
[0:56:42] <+TombstoneTTromboners> i can't believe they really shot Zach in the face
[0:56:42] <$silentblast93> wait was this a documentary on shazam 1?
[0:56:46] <yusefHD> That "Billy Bee" is a 7/11 in a crackhead area LUL
[0:56:51] <+kewlmyc> His father must be ripped
[0:56:53] <NewWillinium> @andre11dr As best as I can tell in DC. ALL the Religions are real. ALL of them.
[0:56:56] <%Reveresao> thats cool
[0:56:56] <Alexgonzsalsaboy> Oh man I forgot this guy was on Sardonicast haha
[0:56:57] <+RealThiele> Short cape also means less airplane accidents

[0:57:05] <+Lolo27234> alex ross is next fucking level
[0:57:06] <kainsonofdeath> I just want DC to make a sitcom of the batfamily hanging out bettween missions in the mansion.
[0:57:07] <bunnyscruff> DC Death is hella cute
[0:57:13] <marcd1907> to be fair most Gods in Marvel are more aliens that are seen as gods by early humans, that's basically what Thor is

[0:59:21] <+zanzibar_junker> Another hurricane is coming
[0:59:21] <yusefHD> La Banquise is pretty much the method of warmth for Quebecers
[0:59:22] <KeiganOfAstora> JUST FIX IT WITH CGI
[0:59:24] <+TombstoneTTromboners> you have to flex
[0:59:24] <NewWillinium> Flex to light up

[0:59:46] <Potatoidea> @WoolieVersus Slight correction, the character based on Alex Ross' dad is Norman McCay, the pastor that witnesses everything happening in Kingdom Come, not Superman. His dad served as the direct reference for him.
[0:59:46] <$silentblast93> yeah
[1:00:02] <+chase959> love that saskatchewan wind chill tho
[1:00:06] <$silentblast93> what is minus 60 wollie?
[1:00:09] <derap41> -5 no wind is pleasant
[1:00:11] <%Solidnick18> i can understand that
[1:00:11] <+kewlmyc> It's why I moved to Texas. Fuck the cold.
[1:00:12] <Chatterbox1991> the wind chill in Maryland is so fucked
[1:00:15] <Saltmeisterr> are we just watching shazam bloopers?
[1:00:17] <+kekkerscrew> Blue Man Group

[1:00:30] <%RioGascar> @silentblast93 The finger of god obviously

[1:00:31] <derap41> wow not CG that's cool
[1:00:32] <+TombstoneTTromboners> holy shit the bus was practical?
[1:00:33] <+mechslayer71> Sounds like a good reason to not fucking live in Canada @woolieversus
[1:00:37] <+seduwu> i‚Äôve been on that exact bus before
[1:00:38] <kukstorm> do canada use fahrenheit or celsious
[1:00:38] <andre11dr> @edjager97 What about the minus 60 in Siberia, which i personally felt once
[1:00:38] <countgaculatv> -10 F is t shirt weather
[1:00:40] <+TombstoneTTromboners> that's sick as hell
[1:00:41] <%marrs_bars> woolieSHOOK_TK check out that bus!
[1:00:41] <yusefHD> That's literally a TTC bus
[1:00:42] <$JobbedBone> Its just a bus Kappa
[1:00:42] <%FuqBoiSlim> @chatterbox1991 its cuz we're right next to the ocean. i hate it
[1:00:44] <+RealThiele> scott pilgrim rode that bus
[1:00:49] <Terrarp> Minus 50 C or F?
[1:00:52] <+ArtemisCroc> a lot of cities in the US have similar busses
[1:00:54] <%Nekros4442> Dear god thats a real bus
[1:00:55] <thewhiterice92> I‚Äôm just a poor SoCal boy, I dont mess with that cold shit
[1:00:57] <+LazyAss24Seven> That windshield should NOT have supported the weight
[1:00:59] <$silentblast93> @RioGascar yeah the middle finger
[1:01:00] <Edjager97> @andre11dr I was thinking North American but Siberia of course takes it.
[1:01:00] <derap41> I was sure it was CG
[1:01:01] <+kewlmyc> Wow that was practical?
[1:01:01] <+jiggy_snipe> @Terrarp the 1st one then the 2nd
[1:01:03] <+Mkingston> Shazam has nothing on Constable Benton Fraser.
[1:01:05] <+Ryu_R> this seems incredibly dangerous
[1:01:10] <Potatoidea> That face LUL
[1:01:11] <+TombstoneTTromboners> ahahaha
[1:01:15] <+kekkerscrew> I'd be terrified being under that thing
[1:01:20] <+TombstoneTTromboners> HELL YEAH WIRE FU
[1:01:22] <%RioGascar> Cheaper to do the real thing then making a fake
[1:01:23] <$JobbedBone> cypher?

[1:01:26] <KeiganOfAstora> Cool jacket guy!
[1:01:28] <+UberWolfman> Morpheus LUL
[1:01:31] <yusefHD> You gotta see how the Walking Dead did a car flip lmfaooo it fell in a whole other angle 'cause they fucked up the editing and had to drop it twice
[1:01:32] <NewWillinium> I felt *bad* for this kid
[1:01:37] <CappuccinoGuil> Mark Strong is GREAT
[1:01:37] <KeiganOfAstora> He looks like Black Adam tho
[1:01:38] <+LazyAss24Seven> Hey its Synestro!
[1:01:39] <+professormorrigan> i like mark strong, villain sucked
[1:01:41] <derap41> SUPER HERO LANDING!
[1:01:42] <KeiganOfAstora> He actually looks like a Black Adam
[1:01:44] <NewWillinium> Yes! I mentioned that earlier too
[1:01:44] <Chatterbox1991> the winters in Maryland arent as bad as the Summer because temperate ass forest country equals humidity so when you add intense heat it makes the outside world feel like a goddamn oven
[1:01:46] <+mckraven> seeing him be lowered down on wires is hilarious
[1:01:46] <+stephaniesadgirl> Wasn't this movie meant to be in Philly, cause that is in no way shape or form a SEPTA bus
[1:01:48] <marcd1907> Mark Strong is the man tho
[1:01:49] <ComfyFox> Johnny Sins is in this too? motherfucker...
[1:01:52] <judgefudge9> That was the best scene
[1:01:55] <PanicSwytch> Dr. Savana right?
[1:01:59] <+kewlmyc> One of the best scenes in the movie
[1:02:01] <centuronstar> That joke was also great in Kung Fu Panda 2
[1:02:02] <RoldanDgr8> Sivana
[1:02:03] <collind99> The villain was good here
[1:02:05] <KeiganOfAstora> Some heroes have super-hearing lol
[1:02:05] <madogod> So woolie and Reggie are on the DC train now?
[1:02:10] <NewWillinium> Dr. Savola I think?
[1:02:10] <Dante_Namikaze1> RIP Mark Strong's Sinestro
[1:02:14] <yusefHD> The Superhero Kayfabe
[1:02:15] <@Solidus_113> also any anime ever
[1:02:15] <TheShockVox> It‚Äôs such a shame Green Lantern was a bomb. Because he was a perfect choice for Sinestro
[1:02:19] <aiutare47> That man looks like a living villain. He was born for it.
[1:02:24] <+Mkingston> British
[1:02:28] <revoltingimp> tensai da!
[1:02:33] <+kewlmyc> Oh yeah, he was Sinestro in that shit ass GL movie
[1:02:41] <%FuqBoiSlim> UH OH BRI'ISH ALERT
[1:02:42] <NewWillinium> I still LIKE Green Lantern. It's not a great film . . .but it was passable no?
[1:02:45] <brunoberserk> mark strong as sinestro was perfect
[1:02:47] <KeiganOfAstora> he's so cool!
[1:02:48] <+BrainOneOhOne> lol, us Brits, born villians
[1:02:51] <dromemer3> beast!!
[1:02:54] <+LazyAss24Seven> Mark Strong killing it in anything DC tho
[1:02:54] <yusefHD> God remember the scene where he summons demons to literally eat the boardroom full of people? That was dark as shit
[1:02:55] <TheShockVox> Movie was shit. His casting was perfect
[1:02:57] <RoldanDgr8> He took the baton from Hugo Weaving
[1:02:58] <KeiganOfAstora> That actually happened
[1:02:59] <derap41> I get a little bit Genghis khan
[1:03:00] <KeiganOfAstora> ouch
[1:03:08] <%gatorafan> I don't know what I'm watching, I'm just here to support [influencer] daedra1DerpyTibs
[1:03:11] <Potatoidea> Whoa
[1:03:36] <+BananaSlammuh> Mark Strong is a great Sinestro
[1:03:41] <Saltmeisterr> @gatorafan same here dude
[1:03:42] <Potatoidea> This behind the scenes stuff is a lot of fun

[1:03:52] <+Bailey__gaming> love blue bodycondom dudes
[1:03:52] <TheShockVox> May we get a good GL someday
[1:03:52] <CappuccinoGuil> Casting Mark Strong was a great move on their part, definitely one of the reasons I was convinced to watch KappaPride
[1:04:02] <KeiganOfAstora> The best part is at the end they forgot to remove some of the crew so they CGI'd in some shopping bags. Corridor Crew talked about it
[1:04:03] <derap41> This is advanced Japanese teather
[1:04:11] <NewWillinium> The sheer contrast between Shazam and Sivola's movement was just perfect
[1:04:12] <+TombstoneTTromboners> XD
[1:04:16] <+Mkingston> she can't see ropes. Don't tell her.
[1:04:20] <derap41> They always break
[1:04:22] <+RealThiele> big talent
[1:04:23] <+mckraven> thats gotta be fun
[1:04:34] <+Chronobot> Its illegal to not play that
[1:04:35] <Applecannon63> hah BIG
[1:04:37] <+Takuatt> @SirKeigan Savid Sandberg uploaded a video to his own youtube channel explaining it. His vids are really good
[1:04:37] <$JobbedBone> boots with the fur
[1:04:39] <derap41> You always have some shit kid smashing it with a board or something
[1:04:47] <+RealThiele> yea flimsy wires being stomped on

[1:13:11] <NewWillinium> 's Predecessor

[1:13:19] <+mckraven> @tonku_the_red there's no such thing as perfect planning
[1:13:21] <absolute_cagemony> DC is superheroes for adults, unlike Marvel which is for kids.

[1:29:19] <%FuqBoiSlim> TALK TO EM NICELY MR CARTER
[1:29:23] <yusefHD> Real talk, fuck Dr. Umar. The memes are funny, but he's genuinely a sack of shit.
[1:29:25] <+harokid> @NewWillinium They're bringing back a bunch of Milestone characters with new comic runs and probably one of those direct to video animated movies, crossing fingers it all does well and the live action gets made
[1:29:25] <+RealThiele> Sisyphus i thought was carrying water in sieves
[1:29:31] <+Estuko> When I used to work at walgreens, I had this older black gentleman that came to visit almost every day and talk to mea bout music. Name was Billy Walker, gave me 2 cds on some sweet jazz music since his own grandkids didn't care. Hope he's doing alright

[1:32:43] <raikagelord1> I‚Äôm mixed so relate to a lot of things.
[1:32:43] <+frunkAF> Trivia Teacher? You had a class on trivia?
[1:32:46] <Deoxislipe> Is there a trivia class in Canadian high schools?
[1:32:50] <Mr_216> wait is she British?!
[1:32:50] <CarlTheHuman> there's a trivia class?
[1:32:52] <%FuqBoiSlim> Chat grips on their bags a little tighter when a black man gets on the elevator with them
[1:32:52] <%gatorafan> The REG system
[1:32:54] <yusefHD> Honestly, I'm hoping we don't have any racists in this chat. Doesn't seem like Woolie regulars would harbour fucked up thoughts like that.
[1:32:54] <+Grayhammatter> trivia teacher?
[1:32:55] <%Lion_kun> Isnt it him and Denzel?
[1:33:00] <pirateofpie> @theghostofhype Cool. Hope it looks way better then that Deathstroke one
[1:33:02] <%doomerskeletor13> I had a similar teacher
[1:33:02] <+mckraven> what is a trivia class?
[1:33:03] <+jiggy_snipe> trivia class is a class on random facts?
[1:33:03] <PanicSwytch> Trivia Class? WTF
[1:33:05] <phatmac16> What do they teach in Canada?
[1:33:10] <+frunkAF> Canadians are weird, man. Learning Trivia and shit
[1:33:12] <+RealThiele> trivia class sounds dope

[1:33:30] <mellorolo> trivia club?
[1:33:31] <+mckraven> a trivia team?!
[1:33:35] <yusefHD> It was trivia club.
[1:33:36] <sweetkek> So it's a quiz bee club
[1:33:36] <heart_ablaze> why the f isn't there classes like this in the u.s?
[1:33:36] <CarlTheHuman> ohhhh so like an after school club
[1:33:37] <%ChoculaUltra> I mean as soon as Krondon showed up on screen people were making Bloods jokes. There's a mixed bag in chat today.
[1:33:38] <%masterfire23> trivia esports? PogChamp
[1:33:44] <Infeirno23> trivis explains why northenlion is good at jeopardy LUL
[1:33:44] <%doomerskeletor13> I had that at my school too but it was a club instead of a class
[1:33:45] <+RealThiele> its like fun stuff is easier to learn
[1:33:45] <PanicSwytch> I would've loved that class
[1:33:47] <OpenYourEels4TheNextFeels> Was it "Reach for the top" ?
[1:33:47] <+seduwu> they really had tsports
[1:33:49] <%FuqBoiSlim> oh a trivia team I had one of those
[1:33:49] <+Sharmanyx> Ok what is woolie watching?
[1:33:49] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @Edjager97
[1:33:49] <+chosenjuan42> is this still the Black lightning ‚ö° thing?
[1:33:50] <prime_name> I'd take that over Math class anyday
[1:33:53] <marcd1907> Maybe since I'm not American I don't get it,but why isn't black history month just dropped and black history is integrated into regular history
[1:33:55] <+ghostsofcarcosa> that's super cool
[1:33:56] <KeiganOfAstora> Harry Belafonte, nice callout
[1:33:59] <+Tonku_the_Red> Schools don't encouirage critical thinking anymore. Just memorization.
[1:34:03] <CarlTheHuman> DAY O
[1:34:03] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:34:05] <yusefHD> They were usually run by teachers who are equally geeky.
[1:34:09] <KeiganOfAstora> Daylight come and me want to go home
[1:34:10] <%doomerskeletor13> These are some good shoutouts
[1:34:16] <Mr_216> @marcd1907 the idea is providing a month of focus
[1:34:16] <+RealThiele> because black history month was created because every OTHER month is white history month
[1:34:17] <+mckraven> @sharmanyx DC Fandome black lightning panel
[1:34:19] <%doomerskeletor13> He did the Banana Boat song
[1:34:19] <+Mkingston> learning for learning sake. My English teacher badly wanted to teach us about loads of interesting stuff but he had to stick to the curriculum.
[1:34:24] <prime_name> Don't be a dick
[1:34:25] <bunnyscruff> @marcd1907 Because America is racist
[1:34:26] <yusefHD> ANOTHER ONE

[1:34:51] <%ChoculaUltra> Its a fucking panel about Black Lightning, calm yourselves.
[1:34:53] <%weapon000> @marcd1907 because that would expose systemic racism and that makes people uncomfortable.
[1:34:54] <PanicSwytch> Yes
[1:34:54] <+chosenjuan42> some states don't want to teach civil rights because "racism is over"
[1:34:55] <+Sharmanyx> @BubbaRands EVERY DAY

[1:35:30] <+Mkingston> Pat makes a living out of being wrong.
[1:35:31] <+Takuatt> They should watch the Man of Tommorrow Premier, its literally the entire animated movie and its pretty good
[1:35:33] <+takutoots> "Be wrong"
[1:35:36] <NewWillinium> It is a rare man that can pull off that Mustache and make it look good
[1:35:36] <KeiganOfAstora> American: "What happened to your people?" Black person: "Your people happened to my people."
[1:35:37] <+jiggy_snipe> don't be wrong alot but don't be afraid to be wrong
[1:35:38] <+RealThiele> old white guy is token white man
[1:35:41] <$JobbedBone> be wrong and fail early in your life while its not a big deal
[1:35:41] <%eyezehuhh> This is all well and good but this isn't actual industry advice
[1:35:45] <$emptyantics> Woolie trying not to cringe
[1:35:45] <heart_ablaze> love it the celebs praise the bibble
[1:35:49] <%ChoculaUltra> it's Dexter's ghost dad.

[1:35:59] <+chosenjuan42> Canada save us from the Billionare tv host
[1:36:01] <%thechungiestofbois> this is such a weird sponsor stream idea

[1:36:16] <NewWillinium> @Sharmanyx Albino Dude. Not White
[1:36:16] <+ShinobiPhoenix> the white black guy was the villain for Black Lightning
[1:36:21] <+Bailey__gaming> when did this turn into a Religious discussion?
[1:36:31] <prime_name> It feels like years at this point
[1:36:31] <+RealThiele> fame and religion go hand in hand
[1:36:34] <+frunkAF> what's her name said god influenced her
[1:36:35] <%doomerskeletor13> You thought it was DC Fandome, but it was me, Bibble class!
[1:36:43] <%DashXero> Upside down is a matter of perspective...
[1:36:44] <%ephie_aka_pulpy> This started to feel like Bible Study really fast
[1:36:45] <PersonaForHire> This is pretty awesome.
[1:36:46] <$JobbedBone> that must be nice Kappa
[1:36:51] <ShiningAxis> I just got here, what kind of stream is this?

[1:36:57] <KeiganOfAstora> oh boy this is a heavy question
[1:37:00] <PanicSwytch> This too real
[1:37:00] <+chosenjuan42> I always thought people were not that stupid like in comics that vote for clearly evil lex luther but we did that her in the USA
[1:37:04] <heart_ablaze> ANYWAY COMIC BOOKS AMIRIGHT FELLAS
[1:37:06] <prime_name> I'm just really worn out man
[1:37:06] <+cvp5127> dont panic chat
[1:37:08] <+seduwu> It fits
[1:37:12] <+RealThiele> Propaganda WORKS
[1:37:13] <Dante_Namikaze1> Black Lightning gets heavy often
[1:37:14] <%weapon000> DC Fandome sponsored
[1:37:14] <Mr_216> I watch Black Lightning and I never knew that the actress playing Lynn was British
[1:37:15] <maskeddudej> this whole session so far is pretty much the shows vibe
[1:37:19] <yusefHD> Believe it or not, no matter what industry you're in - if you're black, that's what people see first. Literally have NFL Players link arms and get booed. Fuck yes this is sick.
[1:37:20] <+frunkAF> why is chat uncomfortable? lol
[1:37:22] <yusefHD> <3
[1:37:24] <%doomerskeletor13> I mean it‚Äôs relevant to the show
[1:37:32] <+Sharmanyx> @FuqBoiSlim Its funny bc when i was in nepal and among all the brown people we thought we saw a white man and it turns out it was an albino nepalese guy. Before you hate I'm Indian
[1:37:35] <Infeirno23> black lightning goes into alot about black issues
[1:37:35] <+BubbaRands> You okay chat? Kappa
[1:37:44] <countgaculatv> Bruh I‚Äôm chillin. Y‚Äôall sweatin yet chat?

[1:37:48] <raikagelord1> @maskeddudej yep....
[1:37:48] <+seduwu> Chat is sweating rn
[1:37:54] <%doomerskeletor13> @frunkaf Discussions on racism make people uncomfortable
[1:37:54] <%sleepofgiants> Krondon as Kang in the next phase of the MCU vs young avengers/west coast avengers let's go
[1:37:56] <%thechungiestofbois> is Black Lightning actually good? I kinda wrote of CW shows after Arrow and Flash
[1:37:58] <yusefHD> Chat is literally that spongebob meme where black people are playing outside, and they're just watching LUL
[1:38:00] <%ChoculaUltra> some people in chat are letting their inner racist jump out and I am very, very disappointed in y'all. Especially the regulars. You know who you are.
[1:38:01] <+chosenjuan42> COMICS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN POLITICAL. CAPTAIN AMERICA PUNCHED ANOTHER COUNTRYS LEADER IN HIS FIRST ISSUE
[1:38:06] <+dirtsniffurperson> Sweating waterfalls
[1:38:11] <+RealThiele> any CW show good or no is still a CW show
[1:38:12] <Edjager97> Chat is sweating extremely hard
[1:38:13] <+harokid> This panel is dope, I've never seen the show but i feel like just vibing with the cast is almost a smarter marketing move than trying to hype up the latest villain or whatever for newcomers
[1:38:15] <+ShinobiPhoenix> Black Lightning gets quite political and the titles of the episodes are all relgious themed
[1:38:15] <heart_ablaze> just joking, what their discussing does matter to the show
[1:38:16] <$emptyantics> Black Lightning confirmed for a retelling of the first arc of The Bibble
[1:38:19] <KeiganOfAstora> CW shows are all bad now
[1:38:19] <+Sharmanyx> fuck it BLM is a feminist marxist group
[1:38:19] <%PadreHail> Caucasian chat looking like that scene from Airplane
[1:38:24] <%masterfire23> *inserts jordan peele gif*
[1:38:26] <Jontman42> I think a joke's been taken a bit literally
[1:38:29] <yusefHD> LUL
[1:38:31] <thisisthenam> No matter what, this is super interesting
[1:38:31] <+Bailey__gaming> @sjay449 2nd best CW show in my opinion, Legends is my fave caus its not afraid to be silly
[1:38:32] <%paladinstarbuster> remember how they released the Floyd body camera footage and the news didn't cover it
[1:38:32] <Sol_Install> lol wut
[1:38:33] <They_Call_Me_The_Fizz> Black Lightning is legit...
[1:38:33] <%chll0ne> @padrehail LUL
[1:38:34] <$emptyantics> LUL LUL
[1:38:35] <+seduwu> black lightning is super different from every CW show

[1:38:48] <yusefHD> @Sharmanyx I don't see a problem with that tbh LUL
[1:38:49] <+RealThiele> @Sharmanyx lookit this huge idiot and coward
[1:38:52] <DonatelloJose> @Sharmanyx Some people might not get this.
[1:38:54] <+cvp5127> they dont push this show enough
[1:39:01] <Saltmeisterr> damn looks like someone cracked
[1:39:02] <GenericTwitchAcc1> I can smell the caucasity off this chat LUL
[1:39:02] <%sleepofgiants> black lightning is actually incredible, yes
[1:39:02] <Mr_216> Yea Black Lightning is way different than any other CW show
[1:39:02] <+RealThiele> most wont
[1:39:03] <+mckraven> @sharmanyx the fuck man?
[1:39:06] <Infeirno23> cw level stuff sometimes but good takes on certain subjects
[1:39:07] <+ShinobiPhoenix> also, black lesbian superhero in Black Lightning
[1:39:07] <prime_name> What season is this show on?
[1:39:13] <Edjager97> I mean if anyone is surprised the show is political, then it's the same with Luke Cage and people loved that.
[1:39:14] <+ManOfReason> Can we get some mods in the chat?
[1:39:14] <DonatelloJose> you better be meming broi
[1:39:18] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Well if Black Lightning is different from the rest of the CW stuff and has a tone like this, I may just check it out
[1:39:19] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Hipersonic22
[1:39:20] <%thechungiestofbois> @Bailey__gaming huh, maybe I'll check it out
[1:39:20] <+Sharmanyx> wheeew chat Ive beeen a fan of TBFplay since metal gear solid V
[1:39:21] <%PadreHail> Luke Cage had a lot of potential that Black Lightning is delivering on
[1:39:21] <They_Call_Me_The_Fizz> First episode has Black Lightning getting Stop-N-Frisked
[1:39:27] <Mr_216> It has finished 3 seasons now
[1:39:28] <+jiggy_snipe> it's been like 5 years since 2020 started
[1:39:29] <+Sharmanyx> Also I ain't white
[1:39:29] <wibbwobbler> they chose to keep it separate from arrow/flash
[1:39:38] <+RealThiele> the net has little tolerance for sarcasm, escpecially over serious shit wise up
[1:39:40] <+harokid> I don't get why chat is sweaty, like, do you know who the stream hosts are lol
[1:39:41] <Dante_Namikaze1> Yeah the first episode starts off with a cop abusing his power on Balck Lightning in his civilian life in front of his kids @woolieversus
[1:39:42] <mark1247> Wayne Brady from ‚Äúwholes line is it‚Äù is in this show, he fucking awesome. @woolieversus
[1:39:46] <%doomerskeletor13> Much like Milestone comics, Black Lightning delves into that stuff
[1:39:46] <+kekkerscrew> Quarentine forced people to be stuck at home and actually see stuff that was happening
[1:39:49] <%chll0ne> @sharmanyx sir
[1:39:51] <$JobbedBone> sry can't relate to millionaires having more time to read books when I crashed my bike and can't afford to go to the hospital.
[1:39:52] <+mckraven> @sharmanyx doesn't make what you said any less dumb
[1:39:57] <+ShinobiPhoenix> @wibbwobbler Until Infinite Crisis anyway...
[1:39:58] <%PadreHail> Wayne Brady's been making moves
[1:39:59] <Edjager97> @kekkerscrew W
[1:40:04] <countgaculatv> First episode of Black Lightning literally had Black Lightning getting pinned and frisked by cops for something he didn‚Äôt do
[1:40:08] <$emptyantics> Are the Black Lightning comic books worth reading?
[1:40:13] <NewWillinium> This show is not going to hold back is it?
[1:40:20] <%PadreHail> I haven't read the comics
[1:40:22] <+Sharmanyx> Fair guys I don't mind what you believe
[1:40:22] <%FuqBoiSlim> not at all
[1:40:33] <mark1247> Wayne Brady from ‚Äúwholes line is it‚Äù is in this show, he freaking awesome. @woolieversus
[1:40:35] <SmortyPuffin> oh shit wayne brady's in this show? i'm gonna go watch this right now

[1:40:37] <+takutoots> boom
[1:40:39] <+seduwu> @sharmanyx literally no one brought up the organization. they‚Äôre talking about the movement
[1:40:40] <KeiganOfAstora> CW is really heavy handed with the SJW stuff and it's usually dumbed down a lot
[1:40:42] <raikagelord1> @emptyantics not sure but I feel like Static Shock is.
[1:40:48] <fangovafang> üôÑ
[1:40:50] <Deoxislipe> does it though?
[1:40:53] <Iwashi94> does it though?
[1:40:54] <Deoxislipe> i sure hope so
[1:40:55] <%koolaid_kevster> are they a "terrorist" organization? black lightning
[1:40:56] <+Bailey__gaming> i think Henderson (the black police dude) becomes head of the poilce in the show doesnt he?
[1:40:56] <%LastHazzerd> does it?
[1:40:57] <+RealThiele> @Sharmanyx boo this man
[1:40:57] <+Sharmanyx> @seduwu NGl im pretty drunk sorry
[1:40:57] <$emptyantics> I know Static Shock is great
[1:40:59] <+donpatrondx> we need to make sure it does
[1:41:00] <%DashXero> I'm not entirely sure.
[1:41:00] <+frunkAF> does it?
[1:41:00] <%Solidnick18> isk
[1:41:05] <+RowenCleric> wait is the show out?
[1:41:06] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:41:06] <yusefHD> Using feminist/SJW as an insult LUL
[1:41:06] <+Sharmanyx> @RealThiele bring it boius
[1:41:07] <+TunakIn> the intro song
[1:41:09] <NewWillinium> Is it just me or has the Dude in the Bottom Right been the quietest of the whole bunch? The Albino dude?
[1:41:10] <Deoxislipe> the dark ages tend to disagree
[1:41:12] <%ChoculaUltra> Can we just not in chat right now? Please?
[1:41:13] <KeiganOfAstora> Cool costumes?
[1:41:15] <%doomerskeletor13> I can feel the tension in chat
[1:41:16] <yusefHD> @seduwu LUL there it is
[1:41:18] <HeroToxiko> Why is JAMES REMAR here?
[1:41:18] <%chll0ne> @yusefhd in 2020 LUL
[1:41:22] <+zooeymainbtw> cw pretty cringe
[1:41:25] <+ShinobiPhoenix> it bends towards justice but it takes its sweet time
[1:41:28] <%PadreHail> Black Lightning is like the polar opposite of Batwoman in terms of how it handles social issues
[1:41:28] <+frunkAF> nobody gets what they deserve
[1:41:29] <+donpatrondx> it's not about waiting for it to bend, but that we need to make sure it does
[1:41:31] <+RealThiele> @Sharmanyx proudly ignorant and showing his true face
[1:41:31] <raikagelord1> The intro is cool yeah
[1:41:31] <Edjager97> @HeroToxiko he's in the show
[1:41:33] <PanicSwytch> Depends on the persons definition of justice
[1:41:34] <SmortyPuffin> even if it doesn't you have to choose to believe it does
[1:41:37] <Deoxislipe> truth is there is no moral arc
[1:41:39] <%doomerskeletor13> It‚Äôs an optimistic take for sure
[1:41:40] <+CAPSLOCKlive> it's a slow bend... sloooooooooow
[1:41:41] <HeroToxiko> @edoh cool
[1:41:42] <+donpatrondx> and there's a lot of people doin their best to make sure that it does, but they need help
[1:41:43] <KeiganOfAstora> What did he say?
[1:41:45] <+BubbaRands> It definitely sways back and forth
[1:41:46] <+ShinobiPhoenix> and some people don't live to see the changes
[1:41:47] <%Shardlab> Power coming up from the people maybe. Power wielded from above, no
[1:41:49] <pibbleton> "The more time I spend with Pat, the more it does not seem evident"
[1:41:50] <+chosenjuan42> people want justice but powerful woolieONEGUY tried to stop justice
[1:41:55] <Jontman42> Historically things are now the best they've ever been and have been on average getting better., it's hard to see within a lifetime though.
[1:41:58] <PirateMike_> What are we watching?
[1:42:03] <%sleepofgiants> if it didn't ultimately bend towards justice, we wouldn't still be here
[1:42:04] <PersonaForHire> It takes decades to make any lasting change
[1:42:04] <+Bailey__gaming> please
[1:42:06] <$DesmondtheOrc> Wait that was really weirdly edited, was that cop like a secret psychic or something? like it didn't look like he gut pun ched him
[1:42:08] <StencilOST> it takes effort to ensure justice, the arm leans to corruption
[1:42:11] <+BubbaRands> psa1guy
[1:42:15] <%koolaid_kevster> there's no good and evil just 2 sides fighting for their versions of "jistice"
[1:42:19] <%PadreHail> I can't believe AngriestPat defeated racism just for Pat Stares At to bring it back
[1:42:19] <Mr_216> Three Seasons so far
[1:42:20] <%DashXero> If you value Justice, you cannot value the Status Quo. It's just that simple.
[1:42:20] <+Bailey__gaming> 2 seasons done
[1:42:22] <KeiganOfAstora> I'd say we need another 100-150 years
[1:42:23] <%koolaid_kevster> justice *
[1:42:25] <PanicSwytch> #Sponsored DCFandome
[1:42:25] <+harokid> It's multiple bends with arcs that aren't exclusively trending one way but as a whole I think we try to make it. It's relative I guess
[1:42:25] <$JobbedBone> Its painful to know that I probably won't see the change I want to see in my lifetime
[1:42:25] <%doomerskeletor13> It takes hundreds of years sometimes because the people in power will prevent any massive shifts and only give minor concessions
[1:42:26] <+RealThiele> id say it leans towards Retribution, not justice
[1:42:26] <+ghostsofcarcosa> @Jontman42 That's not true the life expectancy of Americans is going down and the wealth disparity in the country is the worst its ever been.
[1:42:26] <Dante_Namikaze1> Yeah they will be on season 4
[1:42:27] <Atomic_Blowfish> "L-LET'S TALK ABOUT NEXT SEASON" someone rang the "white people are nervous" alarm
[1:42:30] <+ShinobiPhoenix> I love the actor for Black Lightning himself, he has a strong presence
[1:42:30] <+chosenjuan42> people who hate politics in comics are just mad they are the villains
[1:42:34] <%ephie_aka_pulpy> I live in the south and am surrounded by racism on a frequent bordering on constant basis and not once in my life have I ever felt like the world has bent towards justice.
[1:42:34] <+jiggy_snipe> @DesmondtheOrc it looked weird to me to LUL
[1:42:34] <mark1247> Season 4
[1:42:37] <+kekkerscrew> Justice is not a natural state. It's something that must be fought for
[1:42:39] <+Sharmanyx> look its fucked whats happening to people of different colours. As a indian man growing up in England I get it, not to the same degree that black people get it in the USA though
[1:42:39] <KeiganOfAstora> 100-150 years is 2-3 generations so that's realistic
[1:42:41] <%ChoculaUltra> bro how the fuck did a panel about Black Lightning lead to you chucklefucks talking politics right now? The internet was a fucking mistake.
[1:42:41] <yusefHD> Black Lightning is going to the one place unfettered by capitalism.... SPACE~~
[1:42:42] <HeroToxiko> James remar swooped in like, Y'all need a lightning god?
[1:42:43] <$emptyantics> If you‚Äôre rich and powerful, Justice can‚Äôt reach you, which is sad
[1:42:44] <NewWillinium> People don't want to believe that Institutions can be corrupt from the baste level with that corruption built *into* it from the ground level. So they are slow to face or even admit that there may be a problem. Because if they do then everything is a problem to fix. And they don't want to confront that
[1:42:46] <mark1247> Season 3 the best so far
[1:42:54] <+InfiniteAverage> Im gonna watch this now
[1:42:58] <Jontman42> @ghostsofcarcosa two steps forward one step back is still on average forward
[1:43:01] <CraZ80> breathe chat LUL
[1:43:08] <+RealThiele> America failed reconstruction, which caused Jim Crow, which allowed for the southern strategy, and here we are today
[1:43:09] <DonatelloJose> I love her voice
[1:43:10] <Deoxislipe> but when is the Static cameo? Only way to make me watch
[1:43:12] <+Bailey__gaming> Green Light = Crack that gives you superpowers randomly not always
[1:43:13] <mark1247> Each season get better and better and there no slow down @woolieversus
[1:43:15] <$JobbedBone> BibleThump Its painful to know that we probably won't see the change I want to see in my lifetime
[1:43:15] <HeroToxiko> the most recent season ended with the crisis
[1:43:16] <%chll0ne> @newwillinium the problem with trying to change america with the system in place
[1:43:18] <%PadreHail> That chick is like visiting my auntie's house like 17 years ago
[1:43:20] <NewWillinium> @ChoculaUltra Because nothing is apolitical. It is built into the influences in the show and into every part of our/their lives.
[1:43:21] <+ShinobiPhoenix> @ChoculaUltra Black Lightning is a political show (and comic) with a superhero side
[1:43:27] <wibbwobbler> inconvenient truths lol
[1:43:27] <SonicFeuFeu> spoilers
[1:43:29] <+ghostsofcarcosa> @Jontman42 Between those things and climate that isn't two steps forward. Civilization reaches peaks like Rome and then valleys downwards. We are clearly in many places in a Rome scenario.
[1:43:35] <+Bailey__gaming> Pain Killer is pretty good
[1:43:36] <+zooeymainbtw> people postulating on both sides rn lol. everyone shut up
[1:43:40] <prime_name> Is that a hungry catipiler shirt?
[1:43:41] <NewWillinium> @chll0ne Right?
[1:43:46] <+ShinobiPhoenix> YO, Static is in Young Justice now, including upcoming Season 4
[1:43:46] <+seduwu> It‚Äôs ok chat they‚Äôre done talking about the spooky black people
[1:43:47] <+Sharmanyx> I love all you guys ngl the TBFP community has been one of the best
[1:43:49] <+BubbaRands> Static needs more recognition!
[1:43:52] <yusefHD> I think the mods are on break today LUL
[1:43:53] <CarlTheHuman> the fake dreads he had were ridiculous tho lol
[1:43:54] <HeroToxiko> @zooeymainbtw You don;t pay my sub
[1:43:55] <+donpatrondx> civil rights isnt postulation
[1:43:57] <%chll0ne> @choculaultra everything even the media u consume is political fam
[1:43:57] <PanicSwytch> LUL
[1:43:59] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[1:44:03] <Dante_Namikaze1> @woolieversus idk they can do that in this show but there are plans for a live action Static movie
[1:44:09] <$emptyantics> Adult Static Shock is so wise and powerful it‚Äôs fuckin awesome
[1:44:09] <HeroToxiko> @donpatrondx Facts
[1:44:11] <%PadreHail> Twitch chats don't know how to function outside of Twitch psaDab
[1:44:12] <Jontman42> @ghostsofcarcosa also USA isn't the whole world. Sure but the current peak is higher than the peak of Rome, no?
[1:44:13] <+Takuatt> Takuatt subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 2 month streak! Hey Woolie,just wanted to say after this, the Superman:Man of Tomorrow World Premiere is the full movie if you wanna watch a film and there's also a panel with Morrison and Waid talking about the Multiverse called "DC Multiverse: Comics Master Class"
[1:44:13] <%RioGascar> what in the hell is chat right now???
[1:44:16] <+ShinobiPhoenix> @WoolieVersus Static is in Young Justice Season 3 and 4
[1:44:20] <%chll0ne> sadly as a black man, my skin and life is seen as a political playground
[1:44:23] <%doomerskeletor13> I think Static couldn‚Äôt show up because he was tied up in legal issues for awhile
[1:44:31] <%chll0ne> well im canadian also but yeah
[1:44:31] <%unclekulikov> Static shockkkkk!
[1:44:34] <+takutoots> yo
[1:44:39] <+zooeymainbtw> @chll0ne I feel that man
[1:44:40] <HeroToxiko> @RioGascar the "apoliticals" showed up, a damn shame
[1:44:41] <raikagelord1> @shinobiphoenix and black lighting and he is really cool
[1:44:42] <+l3sovikk> Statik Shock would be rad
[1:44:43] <snakest3alth> Still nothing on Injustice?
[1:44:45] <%doomerskeletor13> @riogascar Racism was being discussed, chat got anxious
[1:44:47] <%masterfire23> I would mind static being a mentee to black lightining
[1:44:47] <%Setsuna_seiei> why do people consider rome the pinnacle of civilazation? it lasted the longest, and adapted to the changing times, hwoever its form of government was improved with its successors
[1:44:48] <+Bailey__gaming> Tobias Face turn would be cool
[1:44:48] <+mckraven> a static movie would be cool
[1:44:56] <+chosenjuan42> Static shock talked about racism and school shootings in their children's show. it was great
[1:45:00] <Mr_216> Tobias Whale is a great character
[1:45:00] <CarlTheHuman> tobias is probably the best part of the show for me
[1:45:03] <+RealThiele> Albino reemus
[1:45:03] <BalloniWright> How was Static not in Injustice NotLikeThis
[1:45:04] <wibbwobbler> hate runs deep, let it go and be happy? plz
[1:45:05] <$DesmondtheOrc> Why is it so hard to just like, not be an asshole?
[1:45:09] <%RioGascar> Static shock was a great show
[1:45:12] <%doomerskeletor13> Oh he‚Äôs Tobias Whale?
[1:45:15] <+ArtemiaArts> I'd honestly rather a CW Static Shock than a movie
[1:45:16] <Infeirno23> tobias goes off with the insulta
[1:45:16] <HeroToxiko> static shock was grear
[1:45:23] <comicalmond9135> wtf is with the reverse durag
[1:45:25] <+Bailey__gaming> This guy kills it every show
[1:45:33] <andre11dr> This dude has a face that belongs on someone in Warhamer
[1:45:36] <NewWillinium> I know literally nothing about Black Lightning so this'll be fun to experience for the first time.
[1:45:37] <+frunkAF> I saw my man's hair follicles
[1:45:38] <Torgue_1> @comicalmond9135 It's a garud
[1:45:39] <+RealThiele> its not political just racists whine that it is to make themselves fgeel safe
[1:45:40] <%chll0ne> but alas everything in america has to be a political debate especially with peoples lives lol
[1:45:42] <prime_name> You can see his pours man
[1:45:47] <+chosenjuan42> wanting equality is sadly political
[1:45:48] <+ManOfReason> Chat chill with the insults
[1:45:48] <%RioGascar> I am surprised thus is able to actually talk politics when i have seen SO MUCH media that is dodging that like a bullet
[1:45:50] <HeroToxiko> @chll0ne we're only "political" to one group of people LUL
[1:45:51] <Infeirno23> @comhave you like never seen that before LUL
[1:45:54] <%PadreHail> My man has that Deep Rock Galactic beard
[1:46:10] <%afronooch> @PadreHail LUL
[1:46:13] <%Setsuna_seiei> @NewWillinium if you end up liking black lightening i would reocmmend static shock easily
[1:46:15] <comicalmond9135> atleast raiden is still in the show
[1:46:15] <+deviljhojho_> transcendent beards
[1:46:17] <CarlTheHuman> i couldn't take wayne brady seriously as a villain last season
[1:46:17] <%doomerskeletor13> @riogascar It‚Äôs hard to avoid with the subject matter of the show
[1:46:18] <revoltingimp> Whale needs to either win next season, or stay out of it until a big fucking return the season after
[1:46:20] <PersonaForHire> Man i miss static shock i used to love it as a kid.
[1:46:22] <+zooeymainbtw> @herotoxiko lol
[1:46:28] <%chll0ne> @herotoxiko it be like that LUL
[1:46:29] <yusefHD> It's pretty simple - if you aren't a part of an affected group, but see yourself questioning ~more often than not~ or downplaying the issues affecting a group, just be empathetic ya dingus.
[1:46:37] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[1:46:37] <+Bailey__gaming> he looks so strange without the beard
[1:46:39] <%masterfire23> man looks good with a beard
[1:46:40] <+deviljhojho_> You wouldn't want to fuck with high school principals in my area either crikObject
[1:46:41] <TigerClaws12> HE GETS MORE THAN ONE
[1:46:43] <+Mkingston> The Human Night Light
[1:46:44] <%ephie_aka_pulpy> Static Shock was so impactful for me as a kid.
[1:46:45] <%chll0ne> ppl really said star wars became political when the new trilogy came out
[1:46:47] <+chase959> static shock was kick ass
[1:46:48] <+chosenjuan42> lol
[1:46:48] <%doomerskeletor13> Badass principal
[1:46:48] <DaKnightWarrior> LUL
[1:46:50] <ccrida> Okay
[1:46:51] <Dante_Namikaze1> he is a principal and a Olympic track start @woolieversus
[1:46:52] <raikagelord1> @chll0ne it wasn‚Äôt for me and just something that was cool and that happened but people kept wanting to force it more and more and that is just how it feels now.ü§∑üèæ‚ôÇÔ∏è
[1:46:53] <%DashXero> You can't prove that he zapped those kids.
[1:46:53] <NewWillinium> @Setsuna_seiei I grew up watching Static Shock so I'll love to see what they've done with the character in the comics
[1:46:54] <+BubbaRands> Yes Mr. Pierce...
[1:46:54] <Mr_implosion> LUL
[1:47:00] <+babyacid> Phoenix Jones arc when?

[1:47:10] <BalloniWright> SPOILERS Kappa
[1:47:11] <%ChoculaUltra> I'm not down playing shit - I just feel that a twitch chat isn't the place to throw blows with people about it when some of us are just here to watch the dc fandome. Sorry if that comes off as being cold to it.
[1:47:11] <KeiganOfAstora> Cool eye effects
[1:47:14] <CarlTheHuman> yeah they crossover with the other cw shows
[1:47:18] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> How many Jokers should we expect this season?

[1:47:27] <%Setsuna_seiei> @NewWillinium idk how they handled him in the comics personally. I think the guy who spearheaded static died some time ago
[1:47:29] <%RioGascar> What???

[1:47:42] <%unclekulikov> Duplication!
[1:47:42] <%masterfire23> crossover stuff
[1:47:43] <%PadreHail> Batwoman is also big trash

[1:48:12] <Arek_1> Gravitation. Black hole!
[1:48:13] <%doomerskeletor13> Arm Fall Off Boy lmao
[1:48:17] <+jiggy_snipe> electromagnetism vs electrokinesis
[1:48:19] <+TunakIn> static is basucally magneto
[1:48:19] <%gatorafan> best vision would be cool for my director
[1:48:20] <Joestar1890> Staic uses Electromagnitism
[1:48:20] <+ShinobiPhoenix> Static is young black Magneto
[1:48:21] <%Setsuna_seiei> @WoolieVersus thats basically it yeah
[1:48:22] <%PadreHail> Static is basically Cole McGrath
[1:48:23] <CarlTheHuman> I think static is more magnetic based
[1:48:23] <andre11dr> We all had that teacher that was just fucking shredded, and had sunglasses dangling from his gold chain
[1:48:25] <%gatorafan> *heat
[1:48:28] <KeiganOfAstora> Unlike Static Shock, whose body is capable of generating his electrical powers, Black Lightning gets his powers from a belt that allows him to generate electricity that he can then use to fight crime
[1:48:28] <+Tonku_the_Red> Fairly sure Static can store electricity inside him as well.
[1:48:32] <Dante_Namikaze1> Static also as some magnetic abilities
[1:48:33] <%chll0ne> give them mr fantastic powers
[1:48:35] <%chll0ne> like stretching
[1:48:35] <comicalmond9135> RAIDEN CONSULT THE ELDER GODS
[1:48:35] <$JobbedBone> Its weird asking these questions of the actors themselves because they don't really know or can't say
[1:48:39] <yusefHD> My power would be to create food from inanimate objects that could be done remotely . RIP World Hunger
[1:48:39] <+theghostofhype> @WoolieVersus One panel you might want to check out is the "Milestone Returns" under Hall of heros in which has several founders of milestone and Jim Lee talking about it's creation and the future of the characters.
[1:48:40] <%doomerskeletor13> Yeah you‚Äôre right Woolie
[1:48:41] <+RealThiele> custom suit in season 4 sounds like a DLC question
[1:48:41] <+seduwu> electricity magneto
[1:48:42] <+Bailey__gaming> @HeroToxiko I hope Jeffereson remembers he has Barrys phone number in Season 4
[1:48:42] <+harokid> Think of the difference between ATLA cartoon firebending and movie firebending
[1:48:43] <aGuyFromPleven> Also, Black Lightning tends to consider his powers a curse a lot of times
[1:48:46] <%ephie_aka_pulpy> My high school principal at my very Christian high school once told the whole school at assembly that he accidentally saw porn on TV. His superpower should be the ability to NOT do that.
[1:48:48] <+CSNG> Static can charge himself up I think
[1:48:48] <HeroToxiko> @PadreHail static shock inspired the whole infamous story
[1:48:49] <ccrida> Bonjour
[1:48:49] <bevyrage> both black lightning and static generate electricity, but static shock is able to draw in energy from his surroundings as he doesn't have as much in the tank as black lightning.
[1:48:53] <mark1247> Jennifer has static power ü§´@woolie
[1:48:54] <+reemasbaid> MILESTONE RETURNS
[1:48:57] <raikagelord1> @chll0ne I agree and I think we just need better writers in my opinion and people willing to take risk on new characters.
[1:48:58] <%masterfire23> static is kinda OP ngl
[1:49:01] <+jiggy_snipe> asking for spoilers lol
[1:49:03] <SonicFeuFeu> france? my country?
[1:49:10] <%PadreHail> @herotoxiko yeye I was just using the comparison anyway
[1:49:17] <%doomerskeletor13> Don‚Äôt ask for spoilers woolieMINHMAX

[1:49:41] <KeiganOfAstora> Pants, Shirt, Vest, Jacket
[1:49:41] <+chosenjuan42> magneto and prof X were commentary on Malcom and MLK. Comics have always been political
[1:49:50] <Mr_216> Well that was fun
[1:49:51] <NewWillinium> Is the who *out* yet? These questions all feel rather . . .spoilerific for a show that I don't think is even out right no?
[1:49:51] <+BrainOneOhOne> 7 piece?
[1:49:51] <+deviljhojho_> Clap
[1:49:52] <%PadreHail> Static Shock has a really great episode on prejudice actually
[1:49:53] <+deviljhojho_> shit
[1:49:55] <bevyrage> @RioGascar static shock is able to draw energy from solar radiation iirc

[1:59:21] <Agami23> guys we need a villain, lets have ANOTHER EVIL SUPERMAN
[1:59:22] <+UnwoundCaesar70> MKvsDC had some dirty shit in it
[1:59:22] <+kewlmyc> Evil Superman is getting old honestly, but Homelander is cool
[1:59:24] <CarlTheHuman> Justice Lord Superman
[1:59:27] <andre11dr> "That's where the idea of infinite zoning came form"
[1:59:29] <%ChoculaUltra> they're about to announce Negan for S4 of IJ2.
[1:59:29] <prime_name> It's never a dictator Batman
[1:59:32] <+CAPSLOCKlive> "What if superman was a dick" is not fresh
[1:59:33] <BalloniWright> Superman puts the Dic in Dictator
[1:59:34] <%thechungiestofbois> Homelander
[1:59:38] <%Solidnick18> yeah he is pretty scary
[1:59:43] <Alexgonzsalsaboy> Angry Joe in shambles
[1:59:46] <Deoxislipe> have you heard about evil JOKER BATMAN who laughs though?
[1:59:46] <Dante_Namikaze1> Remember there is a Nazi Superman
[1:59:46] <+Superbro64> give your dev team EVEN MORE TRAUMA AND PTSD
[1:59:47] <prime_name> An Old Threat....
[1:59:48] <%ChoculaUltra> DC has a "what if Superman was a dick" like every year lmao
[1:59:50] <+RealThiele> after reading the wiki for The Boys im glad i didnt invest in it
[1:59:53] <%doomerskeletor13> Homelander is indeed scary
[1:59:55] <KeiganOfAstora> Superman gets pissed off is only a good story if it has a good ending
[1:59:56] <TigerClaws12> Joe's been malding for a decade by now LUL
[1:59:56] <HeroToxiko> @kewlmyc homelander is older than evil superman LUL
[2:00:00] <leomuratore> Why is Geoff always hunched over in this conferences? He looks so out of place
[2:00:01] <%masterfire23> homelander is very intimidating
[2:00:03] <+Chronobot> Watch THe Boys now with Amazon Prime, double sponser Kappa
[2:00:04] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Irredeemable is a rad comic
[2:00:08] <PanicSwytch> Evil Batman IS the batman who laughs
[2:00:08] <+meowarco> I'm still hoping we actually get that Secret Crisis (Marvel/DC) in the comics and hopefully a game.
[2:00:10] <DrFaustMD> I love Homelander. He did nothing wrong
[2:00:15] <Clear_Truth> not possible
[2:00:16] <Potatoidea> Personally more a fan of Lawful Evil Communist Superman
[2:00:18] <Torgue_1> Would you say it was... grimdark?
[2:00:19] <TomCrimson> Evil-ERRR
[2:00:21] <raikagelord1> @spudnacious_dynasty I need to read that
[2:00:22] <%FuqBoiSlim> In Comics Superman has been good for far longer than evil but in everything else he's been an evil alt version or "morally grey" since like ever
[2:00:28] <KeiganOfAstora> When an animal gets backed into a corner....
[2:00:29] <ccrida> What if superman doesn't hold back and just punches Bruce into red mist?
[2:00:30] <+cvp5127> what is superman used twitter
[2:00:31] <%DashXero> "not that far?" Wait. Didn't Superman...?
[2:00:35] <Agami23> superboy prime
[2:00:36] <%PadreHail> Batman Who Laughs is probably more dangerous than evil Superman
[2:00:36] <+InfiniteAverage> @RealThiele the comic stinks but the show is really good
[2:00:36] <%thechungiestofbois> Remember when Superman murdered a 10 year old child in Injustice 1?
[2:00:36] <heart_ablaze> wasn't there a horror based off evil superman?
[2:00:37] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> It's a great look at mindbroke superman
[2:00:37] <%ChoculaUltra> But what if Superman didn't put the seat down after taking a piss? Coming to DC this year...
[2:00:38] <pirateofpie> I did kinda like how Injustice was the Justice Lords storyline from the dcau, expanded
[2:00:41] <xxmagonx> Evil Batma. would just be the Joker tbh
[2:00:41] <%dekkitout> Superboy Prime is probably the worst it's been, and he's STILL in continuity
[2:00:47] <Joestar1890> @RealThiele To be fair, the comic and show are two different things at this point, with the show being less edgy than the comic
[2:00:50] <DaKnightWarrior> Only Pat can stop Superman.
[2:00:51] <brunoberserk> superdickery
[2:00:53] <countgaculatv> Superman killed a fucking child
[2:00:54] <heart_ablaze> a horror movie I mean
[2:00:56] <KeiganOfAstora> Evil Batman is Red Good
[2:00:58] <KeiganOfAstora> Hood*
[2:00:58] <venomfury86> Homelander>Superman
[2:00:58] <raikagelord1> Superman Prime is EVIL
[2:01:00] <+Grayhammatter> only pat can stop superman
[2:01:01] <+RealThiele> Crazy Talk killed superman
[2:01:03] <+awesomeguy423> whos superboy prime
[2:01:05] <%PadreHail> The Boys comic is fine I feel like both should be consumed
[2:01:05] <HeroToxiko> @kewlmyc im still holding hope for the black noir reveal but i doubt they'll do it now
[2:01:08] <Agami23> oh god, if they make injustice 3 its just gonna be batman who laughs, isnt it
[2:01:13] <Holybond> Homelander is hilarious. @venomfury86
[2:01:15] <SonicFeuFeu> Superman Prime > Evil Superman
[2:01:16] <%Setsuna_seiei> Superboy prime is fucked up
[2:01:17] <DrFaustMD> Prime isn't technically Superman
[2:01:20] <prime_name> ~Countdown~
[2:01:21] <+mckraven> superboy punched time
[2:01:25] <CarlTheHuman> Literally punched reality to change it
[2:01:26] <%PadreHail> Especially cuz the Boys show doesn't contain Butcher Baker Candlestick Maker
[2:01:26] <KeiganOfAstora> Superboy Prime is Crisis On Infinite Earths main antagonist
[2:01:30] <+kewlmyc> I know why Superman is a dick, but does Injustice explain what the fuck happened to Wonder Woman? She's comically evil for seemingly no reason.
[2:01:30] <+reemasbaid> Superboy Prime rules
[2:01:30] <%doomerskeletor13> Punche reality
[2:01:32] <PanicSwytch> It took 3 Flashes to stop Superboy Prime
[2:01:36] <+reemasbaid> punche reality
[2:01:39] <Deoxislipe> but what if the evil joker batman became Dr Manhattan? wouldnt that be CRAZY?! He's so strong and evil you guys
[2:01:40] <+seduwu> Punch reality super hard
[2:01:42] <%ChoculaUltra> Is Superboy Prime still in that one universe where the DC universe is a comic book and he wants out? Or did he get folded back in?
[2:01:42] <%Solidnick18> @mckraven that sounds pretty dope
[2:01:43] <T_Sasquatch> !Uptime
[2:01:43] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 6 minutes
[2:01:43] <Dante_Namikaze1> That was not a soft reset
[2:01:43] <ccrida> Super boy prime's girth cannot be restricted by your puny laws of physics
[2:01:44] <Agami23> bringing back jason todd by accident
[2:01:45] <DrFaustMD> He punch a hole in reality. That's WHY Jason Todd came back to life
[2:01:45] <%Setsuna_seiei> @WoolieVersus Superboy prime is basically "what if golden age superman was in the modern comics?"
[2:01:46] <HeroToxiko> Superboy prime is currently on vacation irl
[2:01:49] <+reemasbaid> he just fought shazam and black adam it was so weird
[2:01:49] <KeiganOfAstora> He's stuck in the Source Wall
[2:01:52] <%Setsuna_seiei> hed be fuckin broken
[2:01:52] <%dekkitout> @awesomeguy423 Oh boy. So in a different universe where heroes didn't exist. Some kid red a superman comic, his name was Clark Kent. He made a wish to be Superman and shenanigans ensued.
[2:01:54] <T_Sasquatch> Fuck yea. I love being late
[2:02:00] <+RealThiele> Wonder woman alwasy low-key hated mordern society
[2:02:05] <DrFaustMD> New 52 was a mistake Rebirth was better
[2:02:06] <Holybond> Pretty sure she's evil from just being afraid and partly in love with superman. @kewlmyc
[2:02:09] <+CAPSLOCKlive> It's nice to hear Woolie talk about comics without pat roaring like a banshee in the background!
[2:02:09] <%FuqBoiSlim> Superboy is so fucking lame but I love him at the same time. He's such a whiney little bitch
[2:02:13] <+egovsalter> To be fair, apparently the reason people are evil in Injustice is because Wonder Woman has been infected by the Anti-Life Equation

[2:13:18] <+Blackenedcrustcynicism> Jim Lee's X-Men is literally what Children of the Atom was based on look wise.
[2:13:20] <%Setsuna_seiei> ASSBAR
[2:13:23] <DrFaustMD> Lee and Didio just aren't good ideas guys

[2:13:34] <Alexgonzsalsaboy> Thats MERICAS DICK
[2:13:38] <+awesomeguy423> Jim Lee is one of the more iconic XMen guys
[2:13:48] <%Solidnick18> oh yeah
[2:13:55] <+awesomeguy423> Id put him almost as high as Claremont
[2:14:02] <Dean_Inbetween> Oh yea there was a madmen crossover
[2:14:09] <DaKnightWarrior> Yeah he did, looks so cool.
[2:14:13] <%Setsuna_seiei> God Jim Lees art is all star batman is so good
[2:14:15] <andre11dr> I think he also did Sub in ik2
[2:14:15] <pirateofpie> I'd read a Jim Lee MK comic
[2:14:16] <%Setsuna_seiei> but that comic is so ass
[2:14:17] <Dean_Inbetween> Where dr manhattan was behind everything
[2:14:18] <%ChoculaUltra> Claremont is the reason everyone knew who the X-Men were monkaS
[2:14:20] <DrFaustMD> That's good
[2:14:23] <+awesomeguy423> tho not quite as high. tbh the X-Men as they are has more or less been forever defined by Claremont
[2:14:23] <$emptyantics> Jim lee is a GOD
[2:14:24] <andre11dr> ij2*
[2:14:26] <IndoorSitup> Do Woolie and Reggie know about Chris Evans' leaked dick pics??
[2:14:28] <%ChoculaUltra> sorry, a FeelsBadMan seems more appropriate
[2:14:29] <PanicSwytch> Did Jim Lee draw House of M?
[2:14:32] <ThePimpGuin> why is the dude on the lower left in my house!?
[2:14:41] <%kyh9> The Iconic Blue and Yellow suits in the MVC games are from Jim Lee
[2:14:43] <Potatoidea> PogChamp

[2:14:49] <xxmagonx> PogChamp
[2:14:50] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @T4silly
[2:14:53] <raikagelord1> @dean_inbetween He was pretty much behind the New 52.
[2:14:53] <DaKnightWarrior> LUL
[2:14:54] <+Grayhammatter> PogChamp
[2:14:56] <NewWillinium> Isn't there already a Prequel comic to Injustice?
[2:14:57] <KeiganOfAstora> Because Alex Ross is so good
[2:14:57] <dekkitout> Based Alex Ross
[2:15:01] <thrashhard> Who isnt
[2:15:02] <KeiganOfAstora> Can't not like Alex Ross
[2:15:03] <raikagelord1> Alex Ross is goated
[2:15:07] <+froduck42> was that Alex Ross or someone jsut emulating his style?
[2:15:07] <%ChoculaUltra> if the women on twitter are anything to go by - everyone seems pleased with Cap's cock.
[2:15:08] <CarlTheHuman> Alex Ross is amazing
[2:15:09] <Dean_Inbetween> @raikagelord1 yea thats what I remembered
[2:15:09] <DrFaustMD> He's the GOAT
[2:15:13] <+PBandJensen> Alex Ross is the boss
[2:15:21] <DaKnightWarrior> Alex Ross is way too good.
[2:15:25] <They_Call_Me_The_Fizz> Injustice Year Zero is all about what happened to Justice Society of America in the Injustice-verse
[2:15:32] <+Squid5_> modern comics LUL
[2:15:32] <+deviljhojho_> like a wes anderson movie
[2:15:34] <KeiganOfAstora> He uses real people to model the characters off of
[2:15:44] <DrFaustMD> His interiors aren't thta great. Peace on Earth and Kingdom Come are great though
[2:15:49] <stevenellis386> My boy Alex ross still kicking
[2:15:51] <+theghostofhype> @WoolieVersus Alex Ross is doing the cover art for the Marvel Ultraman comics
[2:16:12] <+CAPSLOCKlive> EDGE
[2:16:24] <raikagelord1> @Squid5_ Modern Comics is big Miss and sometimes Hit.
[2:16:25] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1303234770881699840?s=19
[2:16:26] <%ephie_aka_pulpy> Alex Ross‚Äô work still feels unreal AF to me
[2:16:27] <%FuqBoiSlim> everytime I see Alex Ross pop up i can't get the Shazam bulge out of my mind I'm sorry i cant
[2:16:29] <IndoorSitup> That is America's cock
[2:16:35] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> LUL
[2:16:39] <%ChoculaUltra> don't they keep Alex Ross in a cryo chamber and only break him out when they need covers to crossovers?
[2:16:45] <DaKnightWarrior> LUL
[2:16:47] <NewWillinium> *Sighs* Correct me if I'm wrong but wasn't Joker a big player in DC vs Mortal Kombat as well?
[2:16:50] <%FuqBoiSlim> Also, Chris Evans' nudies got leaked? thats tuff
[2:16:50] <raikagelord1> @choculaultra basically
[2:16:52] <They_Call_Me_The_Fizz> The Joker is super busted
[2:16:54] <revoltingimp> asylum patient combos for days
[2:16:58] <Azathotic> This chat has a Marvel penis bias
[2:17:15] <Explodincatz> its a nice penis
[2:17:18] <T_Sasquatch> Jokah !
[2:17:19] <%ChoculaUltra> Hey, as soon as we get Pattinson dick pics we'll be DCockboys too.
[2:17:25] <They_Call_Me_The_Fizz> @Azathotic Just saw that Chris Evans is trending, huh?
[2:17:26] <%dekkitout> TBF, there was that one time we got Bat-dong in a comic @Azathotic sbfpRichard
[2:17:27] <nintega010> @Azathotic I mean DC doesn't have anything I like.
[2:17:30] <T_Sasquatch> Looking good JOKER !
[2:17:34] <Alexgonzsalsaboy> Im the jokah baybee
[2:17:34] <raikagelord1> @azathotic I love DC and they have the best video games and cartoons growing up.
[2:17:56] <Azathotic> @raikagelord1 I do too but this is a nothingburger of a virtual con
[2:17:59] <KingKZ> A "dark" take on the Joker is just the Joker.
[2:17:59] <%chll0ne> imo marvel only has good live action movies n comics
[2:18:01] <+Blackenedcrustcynicism> Hell if Joker in Injustice games had MK11 Joker's tool-set he'd probably be good. The problem was he didn't and he was very bad.
[2:18:21] <%condemned_15> Did you know the Joker is dark? m64Damaged
[2:18:31] <andre11dr> This dude needs to get of Speed, he's talking way to fast
[2:18:32] <%chll0ne> i love greg capullo tho
[2:18:42] <IndoorSitup> For whatever reason Chris Evans' has a picture of his face with the caption "GUARD. THAT. PUSSY"
[2:18:43] <%ChoculaUltra> Yeah this is kind've a nothing panel if they're not adding new shit to the game. Game came out in 2017, last major update was back in November iirc?
[2:18:45] <ZeeJiggle> Quick, cut away before gore!
[2:18:45] <Azathotic> Guys, what if Joker but really evil????
[2:19:08] <PanicSwytch> The only intrest I have in Marvel Comics is Xmen, Spidey and FF4. Im more of DC fan
[2:19:08] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[2:19:09] <Alexgonzsalsaboy> @azathotic Brilliant!
[2:19:12] <CarlTheHuman> wHeN's MiLEena?!
[2:19:15] <phatmac16> Max‚Äôs reactions to those were great. Most of the brutalilities are real bad
[2:19:23] <$TheFabledAble> when joker turns robin into a mini joker yea? bamazing episode
[2:19:25] <%thechungiestofbois> Terry vs Joker is based
[2:19:28] <NewWillinium> I . . .am just really tired of the Joker. Let some other Villain take center stage for the bit in the Public consciousness.
[2:19:28] <Explodincatz> what if Batman had jokes
[2:19:28] <%condemned_15> Joker will pull off the greatest boner of all time m64Joku
[2:19:30] <%dekkitout> Bruce is old and very busted
[2:19:36] <+chosenjuan42> Batman beyond gets real
[2:19:37] <DrFaustMD> @panicswytch May I suggest Nextwave: Agents of HATE
[2:19:42] <Arek_1> That's shway.
[2:19:44] <+chosenjuan42> people overdose and shit
[2:19:45] <NewWillinium> Batman Beyond taking on Joker is just the absolute BLAST
[2:19:52] <phatmac16> Batman Beyond movie is lost money
[2:19:53] <KingKZ> These questions...
[2:19:55] <%ChoculaUltra> I'm just saying - bearded John Krasinski would make a great bearded Reed Richards if Disney plans on rolling the FF4 into the mix.
[2:19:58] <quipquest1> Woolie straight-up talking over the Injustice 3 talk. LOL
[2:19:59] <PanicSwytch> @drfaustmd i will check it out
[2:20:00] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> It's good, 'cept for Bruce sleeping with Batgirl
[2:20:01] <+jiggy_snipe> up the butt
[2:20:03] <+mckraven> Joker hates terry cause terry jokes back
[2:20:09] <Agami23> plastic man would be rad in injustice
[2:20:12] <%NeedlesD> Plas
[2:20:23] <NewWillinium> "What's Wrong? I thought you always wanted to make Batman Laugh?"
[2:20:28] <CarlTheHuman> the atom will crawl inside everyone's ass and grow inside them
[2:20:29] <KingKZ> Literally anyone from Injustice could win a MK tournament.
[2:20:32] <Alexgonzsalsaboy> calls him Batfake and everything
[2:20:32] <+ShinobiPhoenix> a universe of Magic?
[2:20:35] <+j0hnnydonuts> he already said they have nothing to announce about injustice
[2:20:37] <nintega010> He already talked about Woolie you talked over the Injustice 3 question
[2:20:39] <+T4silly> Pat will now never play MK ever again.
[2:20:40] <Dragon_agito> all this injustice talk makes you think he gonna announce a third game
[2:20:46] <+ShinobiPhoenix> magic and soul power against Superman?
[2:20:47] <+babyacid> MAH GIC
[2:20:51] <%ChoculaUltra> That's what we're hoping for.
[2:20:58] <raikagelord1> The only good current marvel comics that I know of is Spider-Man, DareDevil, Thor and I think Venom.
[2:21:03] <PanicSwytch> YES
[2:21:04] <%FuqBoiSlim> Push Animal Man for Injustice 3
[2:21:07] <+takutoots> yeah
[2:21:08] <Wild_Samurai> Kabal nerf confirmed
[2:21:09] <+preppyposs> Terry IS TOP TIER
[2:21:10] <LeeOhX> is it me or is the DC peolpe really quiet
[2:21:11] <heart_ablaze> YEP
[2:21:11] <Agami23> you never will woolie
[2:21:13] <%BisoromiBear> ANYTHING PLEASE
[2:21:13] <NewWillinium> I would LOVE a Batman Beyond Arkham style game
[2:21:15] <phatmac16> Yes
[2:21:16] <Chatterbox1991> Let It Go Woolie
[2:21:23] <phatmac16> PUSH BATMAN BEYOND
[2:21:24] <+ShinobiPhoenix> @WoolieVersus wants Batman Beyond to be UNcancelled seeing as WB just cancelled it
[2:21:25] <+Chronobot> He was in the last DCFANDOME in a skit
[2:21:25] <KingKZ> There's no way in hell they spent this much time pushing Injustice for a 3rd game to not come out.
[2:21:25] <%masterfire23> play arkham and use batman beyond suit
[2:21:28] <+takutoots> lets bring in Injustice: Future
[2:21:28] <andre11dr> It won't Woolie
[2:21:30] <raikagelord1> Everyone does Woolie. LUL :(
[2:21:33] <%dekkitout> They're saving Terry for a rainy day- that said Gotham Knights needs a Batman Beyond expansion
[2:21:35] <NewWillinium> Terry Is best Batman
[2:21:38] <+mckraven> Terry isn't even the current batman beyond. he doesn't get anything cool
[2:21:41] <Alexgonzsalsaboy> Push Woolie to play the Arkham games
[2:21:42] <%Dapper_Cactuar> I want it to not just be a Batman Beyond costume for Bruce. GIVE US TERRY
[2:21:46] <PanicSwytch> How about old man bruce and his dog
[2:21:46] <andre11dr> Nobody knows who Terry is ,unfortunately
[2:21:46] <nintega010> I'm not getting the game
[2:21:50] <Dragon_agito> OMG NO MK NEWS????
[2:21:50] <Terrarp> Reminder that Terry showed up in the New 52 only to be killed
[2:21:51] <They_Call_Me_The_Fizz> If any alternate universe stuff is getting into Injustice 3, it's going to be that Bat Who Laughs edgelord bullshit
[2:21:52] <$TheFabledAble> I love when terry laughs and it pisses the joker off xD
[2:21:56] <DrFaustMD> Wait, Woolie hasn't played Arkham?
[2:22:00] <maskeddudej> batman beyond does have some comics so...
[2:22:03] <%ChoculaUltra> or give us the Batman from the first episode of Batman Beyond with the GUN.
[2:22:04] <phatmac16> TERRY WHEN?!?
[2:22:06] <quipquest1> If you want Terry, Woolie, there's the Batman Beyond panel over at KisdVerse
[2:22:06] <LeeOhX> I want them to add Static Shock
[2:22:07] <Flarepulse> thanks jeff
[2:22:08] <Alexgonzsalsaboy> @drfaustmd None of them lol
[2:22:16] <%condemned_15> DoritosChip
[2:22:17] <BlackermanZX> and zoning
[2:22:19] <BlackermanZX> lots of it
[2:22:26] <BackwardCap> Lets be honest, which member of the Justice League WOULDNT win the MK tournament?
[2:22:28] <+j0hnnydonuts> swamp thing is so sick
[2:22:28] <Agami23> swamp thing is cool.
[2:22:30] <+takutoots> The Green
[2:22:34] <NewWillinium> Batman Beyond and Old Man Static Shock
[2:22:35] <+j0hnnydonuts> that game is dope
[2:22:36] <Dean_Inbetween> Ooh italy üáÆüáπ
[2:22:38] <phatmac16> Swamp thing is the best
[2:22:39] <+Grayhammatter> this is a DC thing, @Dragon_agito why would they have anything about MK11?
[2:22:40] <DrFaustMD> @alexgonzsalsaboy He needs to immediately
[2:22:44] <raikagelord1> Max actually really lived Swamp thing as well.
[2:22:44] <%ChoculaUltra> Booster Gold. He'd be too busy trying to hit on Jade or some shit.
[2:22:45] <They_Call_Me_The_Fizz> Swamp Thing is the best thing DC's ever done
[2:22:51] <+Blackenedcrustcynicism> Static was an impossibility, not any more since they worked out a better relationship with the company that produced those comics and are pushing for more Static stuff. I think he could easily be added in an Injustice 3, now.
[2:22:52] <%dekkitout> Alan Moore did the wings for Swamp Thing right?
[2:22:53] <NewWillinium> @BackwardCap . . . Green Arrow maybe?
[2:22:53] <DrFaustMD> It's a Swamp Thang baby
[2:22:56] <andre11dr> Swap Thing is cool, to bad he's really bad
[2:23:01] <PanicSwytch> The Green, The Red and The Rot
[2:23:02] <Alexgonzsalsaboy> We've been trying to convince him for years lol
[2:23:05] <Terrarp> Swamp Thing and Animal Man combo
[2:23:08] <+ShinobiPhoenix> people are really sleeping on MAGIC and Soul power in MK... Justice League is not getting a perfect win if at all
[2:23:08] <+jiggy_snipe> anyone without powers would have trouble but they could still win
[2:23:13] <DragonSpooker> He's off doing swamp things
[2:23:13] <%dream__center> da sand man thing
[2:23:15] <They_Call_Me_The_Fizz> Swamp Thing gets existential AS FUCK
[2:23:16] <BalloniWright> He was in the Justice League Dark Animated Movie
[2:23:24] <Dragon_agito> We need more Lobo in out lives
[2:23:27] <%ChoculaUltra> has Beast Boy been in an Injustice game yet? If not - why not?!
[2:23:28] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:23:30] <+meowarco> I like that only when Neil allows it do they use Sandman
[2:23:33] <DrFaustMD> Remember that time Swamp Thing grew weed so he, Zatanna and Constantine could get high
[2:23:33] <papadonuts77> i would love to see constantine make an appearance
[2:23:38] <%dekkitout> @ChoculaUltra He's dead
[2:23:38] <raikagelord1> @dragon_agito I agree
[2:23:38] <Dean_Inbetween> How would sandman even work in injustice LUL
[2:23:39] <Agami23> swamp thing is part of justice league dark, which is always cool.
[2:23:46] <DaKnightWarrior> Animal man is crazy.
[2:23:48] <Agami23> weirdly so is manbat
[2:23:53] <They_Call_Me_The_Fizz> Swamp Thing is currently part of Justice League Dark alongside Zatanna, Wonder Woman and Detective Chimp!
[2:23:53] <%ChoculaUltra> @dekkitout oh right, IJ universe like 70% of the cool people died LUL
[2:23:55] <+Blackenedcrustcynicism> Well Beast Boy died in the nuke, but they're sort of teased to retcon that that he didn't die.
[2:23:57] <BlackermanZX> man i would like beast boy in a injustice game
[2:24:02] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> THREE JOKERS LUL
[2:24:02] <DrFaustMD> @dean_inbetween It could be golden age JSA sandman
[2:24:04] <Psykoknight65> so was it just them talking about injustice?
[2:24:11] <@Solidus_113> It's the Watchmen hour
[2:24:12] <+jiggy_snipe> time for Watchmen hour
[2:24:20] <$TheFabledAble> "what power does hell have over men, who can no longer dream of heaven?"- sandman convincing demons to let him leave hell like a BOSS
[2:24:20] <Alexgonzsalsaboy> HBO Watchmen is the definitive sequel to me, I think its the only one that gets the source material and has something to say.
[2:24:29] <+NotSafeForPBS> @WoolieVersus thoughts on Matt Wagner and/or Geoff Darryl?
[2:24:31] <Terrarp> wasn't Injustice 3 going to include Watchmen?
[2:24:32] <%dekkitout> Saturday Morning Watchmen
[2:24:34] <BalloniWright> He already watched the Three Jokers panel
[2:24:34] <%masterfire23> did you watch hbo watchmen
[2:24:35] <NewWillinium> I . . . have very mixed feelings on Watchman.
[2:24:36] <Agami23> oh boy, time to hear about doomsday clock
[2:24:36] <DrFaustMD> Can't you see he's already deeeead
[2:24:39] <MartwyPies> has been streamer
[2:24:40] <raikagelord1> Swamp thing has a show, is apart of Justice League Dark And is just getting love.
[2:24:41] <Dean_Inbetween> @drfaustmd but thats not the one people want LUL
[2:24:47] <+Blackenedcrustcynicism> Watchman on HBO is good, I hear. Watchmen in the current DC Universe? Ehhhhhh........... not a fan.
[2:24:59] <%ChoculaUltra> Doomsday Clock was the biggest pile of nothing I ever wasted time on, comics related.
[2:24:59] <Ashenik1> YV SEREIS IS SO GOOD
[2:25:03] <They_Call_Me_The_Fizz> HBO Watchmen is legit... All other Watchmen spin-offs? TRAAAAAAASH
[2:25:03] <%FuqBoiSlim> Doomsday Clock fell off
[2:25:06] <Alexgonzsalsaboy> the show is incredible
[2:25:12] <thrashhard> #reggieDCwatchparty
[2:25:15] <%Joe2187> HBO Watchmen is really really really good
[2:25:21] <%ChoculaUltra> Why the fuck did I ever think it wouldn't be solved with "Superman punches people to their senses" shit.
[2:25:23] <Azathotic> Doomsday Clock literally ended with SOCIAL MEDIA BAD
[2:25:35] <DrFaustMD> @dean_inbetween But wouldn't it be funny? Also if any endless were to get in I'd want Death. Also Lucifer would be a cool pull
[2:25:36] <Alexgonzsalsaboy> Trent Reznors score for the show is amazing
[2:25:39] <%FuqBoiSlim> Shout out to Weird Science front and center in the background
[2:25:42] <PanicSwytch> Doomsday Clock was over hyped
[2:25:52] <Mr_216> The show was incredible
[2:25:55] <coldfire0007> The show would make this chat sweat
[2:25:58] <%masterfire23> the show takes place after the comic
[2:26:01] <Dean_Inbetween> @drfaustmd that is true LUL
[2:26:03] <%ChoculaUltra> they really used the Watchmen franchise to build hype and literally that's it.
[2:26:08] <DrFaustMD> @panicswytch It was but Rebirth was amazing. So many good runs
[2:26:09] <+PBandJensen> That's where I'm from lol
[2:26:11] <+babyacid> BEST re-imagining of Hooded Justice
[2:26:15] <They_Call_Me_The_Fizz> Doomsday Clock fell off because none of the other edgelords over at DC wanted to stop playing with Watchmen
[2:26:19] <Dean_Inbetween> Yea it had a ton of hype but no pay off
[2:26:24] <+InfiniteAverage> everyone should watch HBO Watchmen
[2:26:26] <+Rekinsinn> what'd i miss between 3 jokers and now
[2:26:27] <%FuqBoiSlim> MODERN DAY???
[2:26:31] <PanicSwytch> Rebirth is the best in DC
[2:26:36] <Alexgonzsalsaboy> The Laurie, Looking Glass, and Hooded Justice episodes are so amazing
[2:26:38] <%ChoculaUltra> Dr. Manhattan's commentary on the DC universe wasn't something new - like who didn't know the DC comics revolved around Superman? Literally WHO
[2:26:45] <%FuqBoiSlim> @rekinsinn black lightning and Injustice
[2:26:45] <DrFaustMD> Silencer and Sideways were amazing
[2:26:53] <wruce__billis> I want to see these bastards integrat eWatchmen characters without a hint of irony or shred of self-awareness. Just fuck it, ya know?

[2:27:43] <DrFaustMD> resi ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[2:27:46] <%ChoculaUltra> they're about to announce the Marvel killer - DC vs. SNK
[2:27:49] <Alexgonzsalsaboy> @raikagelord1 I think the show is the definitive Watchmen sequel, only one that has something to say like the original
[2:27:50] <%dekkitout> His Mr Miracle and Vision books were great, Batman though...
[2:27:52] <DrFaustMD> King is a hack fraud
[2:27:58] <%Joe2187> horrible racist as well
[2:27:59] <+InfiniteAverage> @raikagelord1 10/10

[2:28:33] <%ChoculaUltra> Some people hide their bad hairdays with hats :)
[2:28:36] <Infeirno23> @herotoxiko probably havent been to the barber
[2:28:40] <goroke> Even his COCK
[2:28:40] <%chll0ne> scott snyder did it better tho
[2:28:48] <Ashenik1> oh you summer child
[2:28:49] <DrFaustMD> Mister Miracle was okay for the first couple issues but shit the bed with how pretentious King is
[2:28:50] <+Joe2187> Frank Morrison does it better
[2:28:56] <+Tonku_the_Red> And super naked.
[2:28:57] <heart_ablaze> glowing cock and balls
[2:29:02] <%ChoculaUltra> Dr Manhattan is literally "lol, but what if someone was god tho"
[2:29:05] <$laphyrion> @ChoculaUltra Either that or they're embarrassed they're going bald.
[2:29:11] <phatmac16> BIG BLUE DICK
[2:29:15] <DrFaustMD> If you love superheroes you can't write Watchmen Get Garth Ennis on it. He hates capes
[2:29:16] <mulljade12> Strange Adventures is a good book though
[2:29:18] <+PBandJensen> @ChoculaUltra Basically lol
[2:29:19] <andre11dr> Remember the swinging dick aka the most memorable part of the movie?
[2:29:23] <%ChoculaUltra> @laphyrion the only way to parry baldness - hats.
[2:29:25] <Explodincatz> friiiieeeend
[2:29:30] <HeroToxiko> @Infeirno23 that's a name i haven't heard in a long time. people call him clipperman of the buzzcut

[2:29:35] <+Tonku_the_Red> The pirate thing.
[2:29:42] <%ChoculaUltra> The pirate thing!
[2:29:43] <+ShinobiPhoenix> watch the Motion Comics, it helps "read" the comic quickly
[2:29:46] <$laphyrion> @ChoculaUltra Nah, man. Embrace it. BECOME AN AIRBENDER.
[2:29:47] <Alexgonzsalsaboy> Alan Moore literally said Rorshach should never be idolized..
[2:29:49] <PanicSwytch> Yeah the pirate thing lmao
[2:29:50] <DrFaustMD> Read the biography
[2:29:50] <l0rd_sm3xy> Dr Manhattan is literally big blue god
[2:29:51] <%Joe2187> Rorschach wasnt a good person
[2:29:54] <wruce__billis> The supplements Tom King wrote for Detective Comics are far better than any of his real books imo.
[2:29:55] <+ShinobiPhoenix> by quickly, I mean 10 hours
[2:29:59] <%PadreHail> Doomsday Clock is also surprisingly solid
[2:30:05] <Flarepulse> something something tangle of their lives
[2:30:07] <%ChoculaUltra> lowkey would not mind going bald if I had the rad bender tattoos LUL
[2:30:14] <%Raymanguy13> Raymanguy13 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months!
[2:30:15] <%Joe2187> Rorschach was an unstable psychotic racist who thought he was a hero
[2:30:19] <Casinoroyale80> DC IS MILKING WATCHMEN
[2:30:19] <%ephie_aka_pulpy> I just started Doomsday Clock and am enjoying the bell out of it
[2:30:20] <DrFaustMD> @alexgonzsalsaboy Moore also worships a snake puppet what does he know
[2:30:20] <Alexgonzsalsaboy> I really disliked Doomsday Clock
[2:30:22] <+Thatghostpepper> chat are they talking about watchmen or are they doomsday clock?
[2:30:23] <raikagelord1> @alexgonzsalsaboy exactly the same thing that is/should be said about Punisher
[2:30:32] <wruce__billis> I don't remember Rory being racist
[2:30:32] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:30:39] <%FuqBoiSlim> @thatghostpepper Watchmen in general right now
[2:30:44] <+Thatghostpepper> oh ok
[2:30:52] <%ChoculaUltra> If you're ever in a neighborhood and see an off-duty cop in his car with a Punisher sticker on it, walk the other direction.
[2:30:57] <LeeOhX> So is this thing just gonna be people talking about how cool DC stuff is?
[2:30:58] <+mckraven> Alan Moore got fucked over by DC with watchmen
[2:31:03] <raikagelord1> @thatghostpepper new Rorschach comic
[2:31:04] <Azathotic> Garth Ennis on Watchmen comics sound likes a fucking NIGHTMARE
[2:31:10] <Alexgonzsalsaboy> @drfaustmd I mean, Frank Miller is also crazy, he ain't the only one lol
[2:31:15] <%PadreHail> The crossover bits in Doomsday Clock are kinda weird but start to ultimately make sense
[2:31:15] <%Joe2187> Garth Ennis isnt the right writer
[2:31:19] <Azathotic> @mckraven Oh he got fucked over by DC in A LOT of ways
[2:31:21] <Dean_Inbetween> Its so funny cops think the punisher is a symbol they embrace
[2:31:21] <%Joe2187> Frank Morrisson maybe
[2:31:25] <raikagelord1> @azathotic I agree
[2:31:28] <%PadreHail> Garth does n o t like superhero stuff
[2:31:42] <%ChoculaUltra> Cops should be anti-Punisher but hey, here we are LUL
[2:31:42] <Dean_Inbetween> When he is supposed to be a fucking sad deconstruction of crime
[2:31:46] <%PadreHail> Garth would be amazing on Constantine though
[2:31:57] <raikagelord1> Right @choculaultra
[2:31:58] <Dean_Inbetween> Yea the punisher has killed tons of cops
[2:31:58] <%chll0ne> @choculaultra right LUL
[2:32:00] <+Totally_Not_Toby> monkees raw
[2:32:07] <wruce__billis> @PadreHail garth already had a Hellblazer run. It was alright.
[2:32:09] <%FuqBoiSlim> Cops dickriding the punisher is the craziest shit to me. its like 100 simultaneous red flags but some people don't even see the problem with it
[2:32:13] <DrFaustMD> Maybe not Constantine. He works better with grounded street level stuff
[2:32:13] <Azathotic> @PadreHail He already was on Constantine
[2:32:22] <GarbageNirvana> There was a Punisher comic where Punisher himself called out cops who had that
[2:32:31] <%PadreHail> I forgot about Hellblazer
[2:32:34] <%Joe2187> Garth doesnt hate capes, he wrote a good super man
[2:32:37] <Alexgonzsalsaboy> Alan Moore never signed my copy of Watchmen babies
[2:32:40] <Casinoroyale80> TOM IS A FRAUD
[2:32:41] <%ChoculaUltra> Punisher tells people straight up in comics to aspire to be more like Captain America and less like him
[2:32:43] <+Thatghostpepper> the original Rorschach or is it the new Rorschach from domsday clock?
[2:32:43] <$emptyantics> Punisher caling out the cops on it was fucking great
[2:32:59] <Azathotic> Original Flavor Rorscach
[2:33:00] <Dean_Inbetween> Its almost like dumb white people are ignorant to deep symbolism
[2:33:01] <goroke> Drop the metaphorrrrrrr
[2:33:04] <raikagelord1> @garbagenirvana yep that was pretty recent because they and the military where doing it so much
[2:33:10] <$emptyantics> @choculaultra Based Punisher
[2:33:13] <DrFaustMD> @joe2187 He respects Superman. He does hate Capes though. Look at his Daredevil and Spider-Man
[2:33:16] <%ChoculaUltra> But he kills the bad guys tho! Punisher is good!111!11!
[2:33:21] <Dean_Inbetween> They just hur hur shoot bang bang brrr LUL
[2:33:30] <brunoberserk> no swamp thing
[2:33:34] <wruce__billis> @WoolieVersus He came from Moore's Swamp Thing iirc
[2:33:36] <+Blackenedcrustcynicism> Swamp Thing
[2:33:37] <Azathotic> Chat actually hasnt read most of Garth Ennis's Punisher stuff
[2:33:37] <therealtacopancakes> he started with swamp thing
[2:33:43] <pirateofpie> @joe2187 You mean Grant Morrison? I love his stuff, but....I dunno.if its right for Watchmen. He did do a riff on it in Multiversity though lol
[2:33:48] <Azathotic> Garth does not show Punisher as a happy man to admire
[2:33:50] <wruce__billis> That was a good fuckin Sandman issue tho
[2:34:03] <%Joe2187> Yeah, grant morrisson
[2:34:04] <%Joe2187> sorry
[2:34:06] <HeroToxiko> ye
[2:34:14] <Dean_Inbetween> Yea he shows him as a sad shell of a man fighting a battle of constant misery
[2:34:21] <%Joe2187> I think I was getting confused with Frank Quitly and Grant Morrison
[2:34:23] <%PadreHail> I was gonna say I wanna see more Fables stuff but Fables has so much content already especially with Fairest
[2:34:32] <raikagelord1> @azathotic I haven‚Äôt but I heard that is actually good but Punisher is pretty edgy so that seems right up Garth‚Äôs alley.
[2:34:42] <PanicSwytch> Sorry but whats the hate with Tom King? Im ignorant on the subject
[2:34:48] <andre11dr> Sandman was an Alan Moore thing right?
[2:34:53] <alexandrecau> loose canon
[2:34:54] <raikagelord1> @padrehail I agree.
[2:34:56] <brunoberserk> alan moore : * authistic screeching *
[2:34:57] <wruce__billis> @PanicSwytch His Batman run is kinda shit
[2:35:00] <BalloniWright> @andre11dr No, Neil Gayman
[2:35:06] <%Joe2187> Sandman was neil gaimen
[2:35:15] <andre11dr> Oh right
[2:35:18] <pirateofpie> @joe2187 Ah yeah, they do collaborate a lot
[2:35:22] <Casinoroyale80> Tom King is extremely pretentious in his writing .
[2:35:26] <Azathotic> @raikagelord1 Its appropriately edgy. Frank is a cursed man fighting the absolute bottom of humanity. There's also the WACKY WAHOO Punisher where he fights large Russians that was earlier and shit
[2:35:28] <%PadreHail> I think Garth's got weird extremes between Crossed level edgy and Preacher which just has dark humor but tells a pretty consistent story
[2:35:32] <$emptyantics> Isn‚Äôt Roscharch racist?
[2:35:39] <%PadreHail> The Boys is like right in between
[2:35:40] <%ChoculaUltra> oh man, Crossed. What a ride LUL
[2:35:40] <PanicSwytch> thanks
[2:35:56] <DrFaustMD> @emptyantics Yes.but to be fair he hates everyone
[2:36:00] <%Joe2187> Roscharch is a huge psycho racist conspiracy nutbag....
[2:36:01] <+CAPSLOCKlive> That man has a wall of Rabbit paintings
[2:36:02] <%ChoculaUltra> The best way I can describe Crossed - what if you took the Walking Dead but made it even EDGIER.
[2:36:06] <goroke> How would Watchmen universe deal with Covid lol
[2:36:08] <%chll0ne> @emptyantics he‚Äôs extremely right wing so i guess?
[2:36:09] <Alexgonzsalsaboy> Lindelof really did a good job with the show
[2:36:10] <%PadreHail> The sequel to Crossed is actually fine but man
[2:36:13] <+Rekinsinn> cute bunnies
[2:36:16] <mulljade12> I still can't believe he blueballed his readers with the Batman/Catwoman wedding.
[2:36:19] <%Joe2187> The Question is a better version of roschach
[2:36:19] <%FuqBoiSlim> Rorschach is racist, misogynist, chauvinist, POSSIBLY humanist.
[2:36:22] <DrFaustMD> @padrehail Its still really edgy. Remember when the Iron man Expy fucked a cat
[2:36:23] <%PadreHail> The first series is insanely rough
[2:36:25] <$emptyantics> Crossed was edgy for the sake of being edgy
[2:36:34] <pirateofpie> Tom King, I'm mixed on. He has some good stuff, but also some shit I hate
[2:36:34] <+PBandJensen> Nixon was president for 20 years in the book
[2:36:36] <%PadreHail> Y e p
[2:36:36] <raikagelord1> @panicswytch His writing/ his personality now
[2:36:48] <They_Call_Me_The_Fizz> Yeah, if someone tells you they relate to Rorschach, RUN AWAY
[2:36:52] <brunoberserk> just a reminder : doomsday clock sucks
[2:37:01] <outsidedoubtside> RIP vertigo lol
[2:37:05] <DrFaustMD> Omega Men and Vision are Tom Kings only good work
[2:37:08] <%Joe2187> Just a reminder Watchmen Movie sucks
[2:37:09] <wruce__billis> Too bad they axed Vertigo as a label
[2:37:18] <%ChoculaUltra> Vertigo FeelsBadMan
[2:37:24] <%Dapper_Cactuar> don't forget that The Darkness comics are also under DC's umbrella
[2:37:30] <DrFaustMD> @wruce__billis Vertigos last years were pathetic
[2:37:31] <%PadreHail> Doomsday Clock has a lot of good stuff I just think it doesn't stick the landing as well as it could've
[2:37:32] <%Joe2187> The Watchmen movie was such a spit in the face
[2:37:32] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:37:32] <raikagelord1> Y:the last man is FUCKING great.
[2:37:33] <They_Call_Me_The_Fizz> @pirateofpie Heroes In Crisis sucked SOOOOOO BAD
[2:37:35] <%LastHazzerd> i like bunnies
[2:37:39] <%ChoculaUltra> man, the comics industry in general right now is not in a good spot cuz of the whole pandemic thing.
[2:37:55] <%PadreHail> Unrelate but Kill Six Billion Demons is the shit
[2:37:55] <DrFaustMD> @raikagelord1 Thats Brian K Vaugh
[2:37:59] <Dante_Namikaze1> But then there are some Vertigo books that are in DC proper like Sandman and Constantine
[2:38:01] <pirateofpie> Tom King's Mister Miracle was interesting...not sure if I liked it but it was interesting
[2:38:02] <Azathotic> @ChoculaUltra Also the sex creeps
[2:38:06] <%FuqBoiSlim> How many titles did DC cancel again? like 15-20?
[2:38:22] <andre11dr> I wish DC had enough guts to give us Sandman movie, but then again they might fuck it up, also i don't know how the casual audience would feel about it
[2:38:22] <raikagelord1> @choculaultra and other reasons that I don‚Äôt want to get into
[2:38:25] <NewWillinium> They're canceling Batman Beyond unfortunetly.
[2:38:26] <%Joe2187> Reminder DOOM PATROL is amazing
[2:38:30] <%ChoculaUltra> @Azathotic oof, can't forget about that shit. I swear someone is outted every other week!
[2:38:31] <+CAPSLOCKlive> Or you can have QUESTION which is diet Noir
[2:38:31] <NewWillinium> Or at least this current run
[2:38:31] <pirateofpie> @they_call_me_the_fizz Can't believe they did Wally like that
[2:38:32] <wruce__billis> @DrFaustMD I maintain that King's shorts in the back of those Dtective Comics issues which got him his regular gig are his best work
[2:38:38] <%optimasmaximas> just saw why chris evans was trending....
[2:38:43] <$emptyantics> We need a Constatine show
[2:38:47] <+TECHNO_OUTLAW> TECHNO_OUTLAW subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months! how does 3080 Graphics card regret fill
[2:38:54] <%ChoculaUltra> @raikagelord1 its just a grim situation all around FeelsBadMan
[2:38:54] <+RowenCleric> @optimasmaximas uh oh why
[2:38:55] <%psydaku> @emptyantics you mean season 2
[2:39:00] <raikagelord1> @fuqboislim basically but still a lot of Batman loveüòí
[2:39:03] <%ChoculaUltra> and grim is putting it lightly
[2:39:10] <+CAPSLOCKlive> "Guys he Said NO"
[2:39:11] <+Blackenedcrustcynicism> The Question, "The plastic parts on the end of shoelaces are called aglets, and their true purpose is sinister."
[2:39:11] <$emptyantics> Yes my bad I forgot there was a season 1 lol
[2:39:16] <%optimasmaximas> @RowenCleric leaked his own dick pics
[2:39:18] <DrFaustMD> @wruce__billis You are correct. he got some fame from Visions and kept doing the same grim dark pseudo deep BS
[2:39:34] <alexandrecau> Ask owlman instead
[2:39:37] <%saladin1911> The Captain salutes us. That's why lmao
[2:39:39] <NewWillinium> Apparently Keanu Reeves said that he would love to play Constantine again.
[2:39:45] <+RowenCleric> hahaha oh god
[2:39:46] <%croxeye> The FANDOME
[2:39:49] <%ChoculaUltra> oh god, I just remembered they hamfisted Dream into Doomsday Clock too for no fucking reason.
[2:39:51] <brunoberserk> unrelated note : heroes in crisis is awful and character assassination
[2:39:51] <+Takuatt> I don't mind Matt Ryan as Contantine but the Sandman audiodrama had Taron Edgerton as Constantine which would be a 10/10 film casting now he's starting look older
[2:39:53] <raikagelord1> @choculaultra for real I literally got into actual comics 2 years ago.(always been into superhero though)
[2:40:11] <$emptyantics> Owlman is the rich man‚Äôs Batman
[2:40:17] <Casinoroyale80> Keanu Reeves Constatine
[2:40:19] <HeroToxiko> Ultimately he said yes tho
[2:40:31] <NewWillinium> Owlman: Nihilism is everything
[2:40:34] <huskarl_zap> when has something not be deconstructed
[2:40:37] <%LastHazzerd> The Question is silly
[2:40:38] <DrFaustMD> While we're at it I recommend Dennis O'Neil's run on The Question. It's one of the best comics of all time and has best punch girl Lady Shiva
[2:40:39] <wruce__billis> It's making fun of the fan who followed Moore into a bathroopm
[2:40:55] <$emptyantics> I un ironically loved the Keanu Reeves Constatine
[2:41:01] <huskarl_zap> this guys stans cuties
[2:41:04] <alexandrecau> was ditko the objectivist?
[2:41:04] <%ChoculaUltra> @raikagelord1 the comics industry shit is one of those examples of "don't look behind the curtain" cuz it'll ruin your day type shit. Superheroes/cape shit is awesome tho LUL
[2:41:04] <+JoeCoolMaverick> Hello everyone.
[2:41:08] <%FuqBoiSlim> Steve "Ayn Rand was based" Ditko
[2:41:10] <%Joe2187> The New question is a lesbian cop in a love triangle with batwoman
[2:41:12] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> And there is doing a ton of drugs in club bathrooms while on social security while railing against socialism.
[2:41:13] <+Takuatt> @alexandrecau Yeah
[2:41:13] <NewWillinium> It's not terrible! It's just . . . .A mid 2000's Super Hero movie
[2:41:16] <+Totally_Not_Toby> the question based and conspirapilled
[2:41:21] <brunoberserk> the question is cool in the JLU
[2:41:29] <Alexgonzsalsaboy> Ayn "Its okay to be an asshole" Rand
[2:41:34] <+Takuatt> O'Niel Question> JLU Question >Ditko Question
[2:41:37] <+TopTieramisu> fuck ayn rand
[2:41:41] <%FuqBoiSlim> @alexandrecau dawg, ComicTropes did a good video on Ditko and his views. I recommended it
[2:41:47] <%ChoculaUltra> The Question centric episodes of the JLU were my faves!
[2:41:48] <+TopTieramisu> i mean batman
[2:41:55] <andre11dr> Each caracters are crazy in their own way
[2:41:56] <raikagelord1> @choculaultra I 100% agree especially looking at what goes on behind the scenes and on the authors/artist social media
[2:42:05] <%Joe2187> "Roschach's my favorite"....oh no
[2:42:05] <DrFaustMD> Ditkos Question is still amazing in its own eight
[2:42:08] <raikagelord1> @choculaultra same
[2:42:13] <DrFaustMD> *right
[2:42:25] <+Taglog7> Where the Comic Tropes guy? Kappa
[2:42:26] <%ChoculaUltra> just the dialogue between characters in the DCAU seems so...human compared to the live action shit pre-Wonder Woman/Shazam.
[2:42:42] <+JoeCoolMaverick> "Rorschach is a parody character". ...Uh, try telling to people that DON'T think he's a parody character, and take him seriously. Unironically.
[2:42:44] <2Bs_USB_port> Is this the ubisoft thingie?
[2:42:47] <raikagelord1> The Cadmus Project saga in JLU was god-Tier.
[2:43:03] <+Blackenedcrustcynicism> I really love this women hating, homophobic detective who wants the 'truth' to the point it's an obsession and probably would never accept the truth if he got it. Sounds like a good guy.
[2:43:03] <+CAPSLOCKlive> yes it was. JLU was overall fantastic
[2:43:09] <+jiggy_snipe> you can start off as a parody and become you're own thing
[2:43:11] <%LastHazzerd> Sometimes parodies are just as good if not better than the original
[2:43:14] <+Totally_Not_Toby> JLU owns
[2:43:16] <+jiggy_snipe> your*
[2:43:17] <%ChoculaUltra> Dude that last episode with Terry finding out about "the truth" is still a 10/10 episode that was original all on it's own.
[2:43:22] <+Takuatt> @JoeCoolMaverick A great Alan Moore quote has him talking about ho he'd tell people who identified with Rorschach to stay away from him
[2:43:23] <+Totally_Not_Toby> we miss you, Man Of Action
[2:43:27] <+kekkerscrew> Rorschach isn't a parody character, but he is a deconstruction. We aren't Suppoed to Like Rorshach
[2:43:29] <Explodincatz> JLU was the best
[2:43:31] <wruce__billis> Hey is Snyder/Capullo on anything right now
[2:43:32] <Alexgonzsalsaboy> @choculaultra 100%
[2:43:33] <pirateofpie> JLU just understood how to make a superhero story. No version of the Justice League has touched it since imo
[2:43:35] <$emptyantics> Zack Snyder‚Äôs Watchmen was good
[2:43:40] <+bobfriskit> thats a lot of rebbits
[2:43:56] <+JoeCoolMaverick> @Takuatt, yes, that's awesome!!!
[2:43:58] <%Joe2187> Snyders Watchmen was fucking rubbish
[2:44:00] <%LastHazzerd> Wait is that the guy who hangs out with macaulay culkin? from bunny ears?
[2:44:03] <+kekkerscrew> Snyder's Watchmen was a good movie, but a terrible adaptation
[2:44:05] <+Dova573> as one piece marines would say ABSOLUTE JUSTICE
[2:44:08] <Dante_Namikaze1> and and Rorschach also hates gay people
[2:44:09] <+Takuatt> Squidbois represent
[2:44:11] <Alexgonzsalsaboy> Disagree about Zack Snyders Watchmen, feels like he missed the point of the book
[2:44:12] <+Dova573> or Dark Justice
[2:44:16] <LoopiDarko> Rorschach is also a super racist and facist
[2:44:21] <raikagelord1> @choculaultra I hate Man of Steel because Superman is all like ‚ÄúWoah is me, I‚Äôm a Demi-God who was raised as Human and want to save people‚Äù
[2:44:37] <raikagelord1> @dova573 good reference
[2:44:37] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1303234770881699840?s=19
[2:44:50] <+TopTieramisu> enough about ayn rand
[2:44:59] <%ChoculaUltra> man, Superman in JLU or any of the animated series is a million times more human than anything we got in a Snyder flick.
[2:45:07] <They_Call_Me_The_Fizz> Tom King lost a lot of cool points with me with Heroes In Crisis, especially with the shameless ripoff of "35 Mintues Ago"
[2:45:11] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Nice one Woolie
[2:45:12] <Chatterbox1991> Rorschach is basically the natural evolution of Batman and Punisher in that hes pretty much proto Fascist
[2:45:17] <%Joe2187> Snyder doesnt understand superheroes
[2:45:18] <raikagelord1> @choculaultra 1000% agree
[2:45:28] <%ChoculaUltra> I feel like Snyder completely forgets that Supes GREW UP ON EARTH. WITH HUMANS. HAS FRIENDS.
[2:45:29] <%ChoculaUltra> etc.
[2:45:41] <They_Call_Me_The_Fizz> Zack Snyder is the epitome of "WOW! COOL ROBOT!"
[2:45:42] <$emptyantics> Snyder‚Äôs Superman is awful
[2:45:49] <+Blackenedcrustcynicism> What if Batman was Qanon?
[2:45:54] <$emptyantics> JLU is the best version of Superman
[2:46:01] <%Joe2187> Thats Roschach
[2:46:05] <phatmac16> Saving someone isn‚Äôt a simple thing to do
[2:46:05] <+TopTieramisu> snyder: what if superhero but a libertarian's wet dream?
[2:46:05] <%FuqBoiSlim> Aye man I love Batman but the fact that his arch enemy has been giving him hell for 70 years in wing tip dress shoes never sat right with me
[2:46:07] <andre11dr> Snyder Superman is like "Look, it's Jesus, and just in case you didn't get it we framed him as Jesus as well"
[2:46:07] <%Cerephesis> Whats up with all those rabbits?
[2:46:17] <DrFaustMD> @choculaultra His Superman didn't have friends and wasn't personable. He made him an outsider from the start
[2:46:20] <+Taglog7> Woolie should have cosplayed as the Simpson's comic book guy.
[2:46:21] <Sajallday> ngl I thought y'all was talking about Scott synder chat
[2:46:27] <alexandrecau> bend the code and use poison
[2:46:38] <%Joe2187> "Will blow you the head"
[2:46:44] <+CAPSLOCKlive> Yes we blow you the head
[2:46:48] <%ChoculaUltra> "Did we mention he's JESUS?!" Snyder shouts with a megaphone from the front of the theatre LUL
[2:46:56] <+Blackenedcrustcynicism> LUL
[2:46:58] <$emptyantics> LUL LUL
[2:46:59] <+jiggy_snipe> blow your mind yes
[2:47:01] <DrFaustMD> Scott Snyder is mainly Batman
[2:47:08] <phatmac16> LUL
[2:47:20] <phatmac16> Snyder is such a hack
[2:47:23] <Azathotic> @Chatterbox1991 Kind of. Rorscach is admittedly insane and his philosophy crumbles under pressure. He's sus of the govt too at times. He's cape Dale Gribble
[2:47:23] <%Joe2187> Snyder cut is just gonna be forty extra minutes of batman licking supermans balls
[2:47:32] <Alexgonzsalsaboy> Reminder The Leftovers and The Watchmen show are great
[2:47:38] <DrFaustMD> @joe2187 But what if it's good
[2:47:47] <pirateofpie> ....Not gonna lie, I actually wanna see the Snyder cut. It's gonna be batshit stupid lol
[2:47:54] <Azathotic> @Joe2187 WHY DO THEY TASTE LIKE MARTHA??
[2:47:55] <brunoberserk> remember when Alan Moore claimed to seen John Constantine ?
[2:48:01] <pirateofpie> Plus I wanna see dude as Martian Manhunter
[2:48:01] <+ArtemisCroc> rorschach doesn't deserve his own book, he's not that complex
[2:48:05] <DrFaustMD> Am I the only one here that doesn't like the Watchmen show? I've hated all watchmen sequels and prequels
[2:48:10] <andre11dr> @choculaultra "Y'all motherfuckers need some Jesus" Snyder
[2:48:12] <wruce__billis> @brunoberserk i believe him
[2:48:24] <%ChoculaUltra> I feel like a Rorshach standalone series would only detract more from his "legacy" if that makes any sense.
[2:48:26] <lord__giraffe> Martian manhunter is still my favorite to this day
[2:48:31] <+TopTieramisu> the watchmen show was great until it devolved into "all the racists are in this one place to be wiped out"
[2:48:34] <%Joe2187> The Watchmen show was more faithfull to the book than any of the other spinoffs who didnt understand the context
[2:48:38] <phatmac16> The watchmen show is controversial for sure
[2:48:39] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[2:48:42] <%dekkitout> Alan Moore is also a wizard
[2:48:45] <%ChoculaUltra> LUL
[2:48:48] <+JoeCoolMaverick> Like, honestly, most of the characters in Watchmen, I'm like, "Honestly, I don't want to associate with any of you. Especially Rorschach. And ESPECIALLY Dr. Manhattan.
[2:48:48] <Willfordbrimly> Grant Morrison > Alan Moore. Fight me.
[2:48:49] <They_Call_Me_The_Fizz> Alan Moore: Bitter old man... with really creepy fetishes...
[2:48:53] <brunoberserk> Alan Moore : drugs ... lot of a drugs
[2:48:55] <shadowslygaming> big blue dil
[2:48:58] <Alexgonzsalsaboy> Yeah the last episode I didn't like but I loved all the character episodes
[2:49:00] <$emptyantics> Alan Moore is fucking crazy
[2:49:02] <Memdosu> the anti-J.R.R. Martin
[2:49:03] <phatmac16> GET OUT OFF MY CAVE
[2:49:05] <+Blackenedcrustcynicism> Alan Moore is a "You're not wrong, you're just an asshole" Alan "Birth of a Nation is the first superhero film" Moore.
[2:49:08] <DrFaustMD> @willfordbrimly Why would I boo you, you're right
[2:49:08] <$emptyantics> But he can occasionally write some good stuff
[2:49:09] <%Joe2187> SNAKE GOD
[2:49:10] <%FuqBoiSlim> Ancient English Wizard Alan Moore
[2:49:11] <pirateofpie> @willfordbrimly I'm with you lol
[2:49:14] <tattleworm> he did a really good interview with chapo about magic. he's nuts but fascinating to listen to.
[2:49:14] <+Totally_Not_Toby> he's a weirdo and it's not always great
[2:49:34] <They_Call_Me_The_Fizz> Remember when Alan Moore wrote a comic about a female detective giving a fishman a handjob?
[2:49:35] <+JoeCoolMaverick> To me, Dr. Manhattan is a nihilistic, existential nightmare incarnate.
[2:49:36] <+Tonku_the_Red> Alan is a strange fellow but that guy can write a good comic book.
[2:49:38] <%chll0ne> @joe2187 LUL
[2:49:53] <Azathotic> Alan "Everyone who liked Avengers movie has brain damage" Moore
[2:49:55] <+Totally_Not_Toby> Superman vs Swamp Thing raw
[2:50:04] <Willfordbrimly> @Tonku_the_Red Alan Moore is incapable of writing a story that doesn't feature rape
[2:50:07] <+Totally_Not_Toby> the man of tomorrow is heading south to die
[2:50:11] <Ashenik1> @WoolieVersus Alan More was comunicating iwht the artis what type of clours and angles in each box. OS it wasnt just went to a cave and throw story out.
[2:50:14] <$emptyantics> Alan ‚ÄúI hate Nixon more than Satan himself‚Äù Moorw
[2:50:19] <They_Call_Me_The_Fizz> Alan "The Shape of Water But With More Rape" Moore
[2:50:22] <Alexgonzsalsaboy> Alan Moore is SUPER nuts lol, I just like the worlds he helped build
[2:50:27] <+TopTieramisu> i hate nixon more than a fictional character
[2:50:31] <%optimasmaximas> WATCHMEN CAST FEATURING REGGIE PLS
[2:50:38] <%FuqBoiSlim> @emptyantics that's kind of based tbh
[2:50:38] <+kekkerscrew> Being good and uncorruptable isn't the same as not being flawed.
[2:50:41] <wruce__billis> @They_Call_Me_The_Fizz TYhat comic came out first, Shape is Neonomicon with less fucking
[2:50:41] <%ephie_aka_pulpy> Alan Moore being a legit ceremonial wizard is probably the craziest thing I‚Äôve learned about him. And pretty much everything about him is crazy lol
[2:50:46] <andre11dr> Alan Moore tried to predict the end of the world with comic books, give him a break
[2:50:51] <coldfire0007> Watch the show too
[2:51:00] <+egovsalter> But is it a Watchmen sequel or a Doomsday Clock sequel?
[2:51:00] <raikagelord1> Captain Marvel( before he became Shazam) was my favorite. I loved the story with Alex Ross in DC‚Äôs World‚Äôs greatest hero‚Äôs.
[2:51:13] <+babyacid> the alan moore on the phone story from warren ellis is my favourite thing
[2:51:25] <DrFaustMD> @pulpchicrnd Grant Morrison is a chaos magician who believes that every story he writes is a door to another universe
[2:51:27] <Ashenik1> And the showrunner is a white guy!
[2:51:32] <%optimasmaximas> injustice time?
[2:51:34] <Alexgonzsalsaboy> Yeah Woolie you should def give it a shot
[2:51:48] <andre11dr> We already did Injustice
[2:51:48] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:51:48] <%FuqBoiSlim> @optimasmaximas we did injustice
[2:51:49] <+Thatghostpepper> the 3 jokers?
[2:51:49] <%Setsuna_seiei> man the show is so bad imo. Its not watchmen
[2:51:56] <+Blackenedcrustcynicism> I hear that Three Joker's comic is beyond awful. From the concept, not a surprise.
[2:51:57] <+jiggy_snipe> did 3 jokers
[2:52:00] <brunoberserk> Alan '' i love drugs'' Moore
[2:52:02] <%Setsuna_seiei> id reocmmend the doomsday clock for a good read though
[2:52:03] <%dekkitout> @DrFaustMD Chaos Magician is probably the best term someone uses for him LUL
[2:52:03] <+jiggy_snipe> more Watchmen
[2:52:03] <+skyheys> I'm surprised this is where today's stream went
[2:52:05] <Deoxislipe> oh no, not the thre jokers!
[2:52:05] <%optimasmaximas> @FuqBoiSlim fuck, knew i shouldnt have taken a shower
[2:52:06] <Willfordbrimly> Alan "Joined an esoteric cult to embody his tentacle fetish" Moore
[2:52:14] <PanicSwytch> We did injustice a d 3 jokers already
[2:52:14] <+TopTieramisu> THREE jokers?
[2:52:20] <DrFaustMD> Three Jokers was set up in like 2016 or so during the Darkseid war.
[2:52:23] <+TopTieramisu> jokaire x3
[2:52:24] <pirateofpie> I like to think every shot Morrison takes at Moore is him trying to goad him into a wizard battke
[2:52:25] <andre11dr> Alan "i saw the fucking demons" Moore
[2:52:28] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Willfordbrimly
[2:52:28] <raikagelord1> Reload the web page?
[2:52:34] <Dean_Inbetween> If the ultimate fate of all life is destruction through free will, why not create an ever lasting union... ü§î
[2:52:34] <Deoxislipe> I just want it all to burn down
[2:52:39] <Deoxislipe> the big two must PERISH
[2:52:41] <%ChoculaUltra> Unmasked monkaS
[2:53:05] <Dean_Inbetween> It all comes down to consequentialist ethics
[2:53:07] <+cliffy595> did woolie clear out his bookshelf just to put batman there
[2:53:08] <wruce__billis> Three Jokers is actually really great
[2:53:10] <Alexgonzsalsaboy> Oh no hope it doesn't spoil anything
[2:53:21] <DrFaustMD> @deoxislipe I mean it's not like there are many good indies. Valiant is strong tho
[2:53:25] <raikagelord1> @wruce__billis it seems cool
[2:53:32] <They_Call_Me_The_Fizz> I doubt this documentary will touch upon the legal loophole DC used to keep the rights to Watchmen out of Moore's hands
[2:53:37] <%ChoculaUltra> @cliffy595 Batman brought the other figures to "justice." There were no survivors FeelsBadMan
[2:53:39] <%LastHazzerd> like aviators
[2:53:42] <DrFaustMD> "watchmen show" ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[2:53:44] <%psydaku> @Dean_Inbetween cuz then you get the SMT Law ending
[2:53:47] <+skyheys> Man I sure love media created to prey on creator rights and bad contracts!
[2:53:48] <%LastHazzerd> or a chat
[2:53:56] <%Joe2187> Never forget LUBE MAN
[2:54:02] <%chll0ne> SMT REFERENCE?! IM HERE
[2:54:03] <+TopTieramisu> i like the show's take on the origins of masked heroes
[2:54:16] <%FuqBoiSlim> "Watchmen show" PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[2:54:20] <Mangahero18> oh shit. I missed the start of this by a long shot huh?
[2:54:21] <Dean_Inbetween> @psydaku that‚Äôs not what im referencing but okay :v
[2:54:28] <wruce__billis> @skyheys lmao bruh you're in a comic book event
[2:54:30] <%Joe2187> Hooded Justice is legit the best superhero origin I've seen by far
[2:54:37] <+TopTieramisu> it is great
[2:54:42] <+TopTieramisu> he's the highlight of the show
[2:54:45] <HeroToxiko> @Joe2187 facts
[2:54:46] <brunoberserk> Alan '' i am in a snake cult '' Moore
[2:54:50] <Mangahero18> guess ill watch the recording on Ytube.
[2:54:53] <DonatelloJose> I was not taught this in school wtf
[2:54:53] <%Setsuna_seiei> Whos watched the show so far and finished it?
[2:54:56] <+PBandJensen> We have a memorial to it here in Tulsa
[2:54:56] <+jiggy_snipe> well Reggie you're Canadian lol
[2:54:57] <Alexgonzsalsaboy> Looking Glass and Laurie too
[2:54:59] <+skyheys> @wruce__billis Kinda the point, yes
[2:55:01] <andre11dr> Danm ,that's a pretty gruesome way to start a show
[2:55:02] <HeroToxiko> oh look tulsa
[2:55:07] <HeroToxiko> black wallstreet
[2:55:11] <%ChoculaUltra> Alan "I hate it when people adapt my work but with enough money I'll stfu" Moore
[2:55:14] <+Taglog7> I watched the AltX summary Kappa
[2:55:16] <+Totally_Not_Toby> yankees keep telling me "oh i've never heard of this" like hm i wonder why
[2:55:18] <countgaculatv> Of course they wouldn‚Äôt tell you about Teminem square
[2:55:25] <DonatelloJose> jesus
[2:55:25] <Agami23> same for the stuff in wilmington NC
[2:55:28] <Dean_Inbetween> @psydaku something something armored casket something something poetry..
[2:55:32] <%Joe2187> Tulsa is not taught in SOUTHER SCHOOLS
[2:55:36] <%Joe2187> because of reasons
[2:55:41] <+TopTieramisu> :)
[2:55:42] <%chll0ne> learned about it recently as well
[2:55:42] <%ChoculaUltra> That's wild.
[2:55:49] <+Mundkipz> is it me or is the show volume kinda low?
[2:55:52] <@Moobot> Easy with the emojis @babyacid
[2:55:55] <Dante_Namikaze1> Yeah no that was not taught to me school I didn't hear of it till this show came out
[2:55:56] <%chll0ne> but i knew black wallstreet was a thing back in 20-3
[2:55:56] <%masterfire23> i wonder how many spoilers this is gonna have
[2:56:00] <raikagelord1> @joe2187 I‚Äôm just now learning about it.
[2:56:00] <%chll0ne> 2013*
[2:56:03] <Alexgonzsalsaboy> Yo that Trent Reznor/Atticus Ross score is godlike
[2:56:03] <DonatelloJose> Tulsa was not taught in my mostly white northern school.
[2:56:05] <%ChoculaUltra> I would've thought it was necessary curriculum for the Southern states AT LEAST.
[2:56:05] <They_Call_Me_The_Fizz> Trump's trying to suppress Black History teaching like the 1619 Project right now...
[2:56:07] <%FuqBoiSlim> @joe2187 it goes against the "MLK Jr dies so racism is over" curriculum
[2:56:10] <+Totally_Not_Toby> bro it's all kinds of taught in southern schools the only people i've ever known who don't know about it re yankees
[2:56:12] <+TopTieramisu> i definitely didn't learn about tulsa in school
[2:56:14] <%Joe2187> Yall need to learn about ROSEWOOD
[2:56:16] <countgaculatv> I was young when I learned about Tulsa. Safe to say I didn‚Äôt have a respect for authority
[2:56:24] <%eyezehuhh> I'm black and didn
[2:56:25] <DonatelloJose> @FuqBoiSlim This. \
[2:56:26] <+babyacid> Emojis?
[2:56:33] <countgaculatv> Rosewood is some bullshit
[2:56:38] <+Totally_Not_Toby> then again i was homeschooled, that's how you learn about this stuff
[2:56:38] <%optimasmaximas> @Totally_Not_Toby dude no, its hardly taughtall around and its sad
[2:56:39] <%eyezehuhh> didn't learn about it until last year
[2:56:40] <+PBandJensen> @ChoculaUltra Nope. Didn't learn about it until after high school
[2:56:41] <%psydaku> @Joe2187 tell em about black rosewood
[2:56:43] <+senfood> @ChoculaUltra It was most definitely not taught in Southern states.
[2:56:46] <%Setsuna_seiei> @TopTieramisu im pretty sure it was covered in middle school once you get to history more
[2:56:54] <+JoeCoolMaverick> Oh, that's horrifying.
[2:56:54] <%Setsuna_seiei> or ratehr us history
[2:56:54] <Nocturnment> we were taught it at our middle school in Texas
[2:56:56] <Explodincatz> uuhhhh
[2:56:57] <NewWillinium> Oh gods I hate it.
[2:56:58] <brunoberserk> When Saturday Morning Watchmen ??
[2:57:01] <alexandrecau> dopa?
[2:57:02] <Deoxislipe> @DrFaustMD In the end I just dislike the way the big two shape the comic industry. The way characters rights are handled, the endless crossovers and reboots in these convoluted timelines
[2:57:02] <+InfiniteAverage> the show is 10/10 guys pls watch it
[2:57:05] <%ChoculaUltra> I'm just glad the Watchmen show inspired people to learn more about history on their own terms. You only really see how much the school system dicked you down when you're out of it.
[2:57:06] <+Totally_Not_Toby> @Nocturnment exactly, same here
[2:57:08] <jsavarin> I was taught about Tulsa, but only because I was in advanced placement classes with a very real teacher. believe it or not she was fired the year after i graduated
[2:57:09] <NewWillinium> This is big "Uhhhhhhhhhhhh" right now
[2:57:10] <wruce__billis> Police wearing masks is the scariest shit ever
[2:57:13] <+skyheys> @brunoberserk You're watching it
[2:57:14] <+JoeCoolMaverick> Cops wearing masks. Like, holy shit.
[2:57:18] <They_Call_Me_The_Fizz> All Rorschachs Are Bastards
[2:57:20] <Chatterbox1991> so the writers of this show can predict the fucking future?
[2:57:20] <andre11dr> In Europe, you better get any black history education, i had to find a lot of it on my own
[2:57:23] <%Joe2187> WATCH THE SHOW
[2:57:27] <Alexgonzsalsaboy> Woolie its so good!!!

[2:57:40] <%Setsuna_seiei> man theyre really hyping the show, but its seriously not that good
[2:57:40] <tattleworm> irl, cops have specially made bands to cover up their badge numbers now so we're pretty much there
[2:57:42] <%eyezehuhh> I'm sold
[2:57:42] <HeroToxiko> IT'S GOOD
[2:57:43] <+TopTieramisu> watch it woolie
[2:57:48] <%optimasmaximas> YIKES
[2:57:49] <%ChrisAlgoo> especially the armored up riot copts
[2:57:50] <DaKnightWarrior> Woolie give it a try. it's really good
[2:57:51] <+Taglog7> Ah, the good ol' days
[2:57:52] <Sajallday> I wann

[2:57:57] <%optimasmaximas> PUT HIM ON THE AMERICAN TRAITOR LIST
[2:57:58] <alexandrecau> the call outs
[2:58:01] <Explodincatz> LUL
[2:58:05] <+Totally_Not_Toby> this sounds ResidentSleeper
[2:58:06] <raikagelord1> LUL LUL LUL
[2:58:11] <Dio_TR> Only incels don't like the show
[2:58:11] <+OmegaWeltall> Hey its Huey/Riley from The Boondocks
[2:58:15] <%ephie_aka_pulpy> This looks so fire
[2:58:15] <+skyheys> @setsuna_seiei Yeah. there's some cool surface level ideas but the show itself is blehhhhh.
[2:58:16] <HeroToxiko> on second thought westworld season 3 wasn;t even bad
[2:58:18] <They_Call_Me_The_Fizz> Regina King KILLED it
[2:58:19] <Potatoidea> They're not holding back
[2:58:19] <raikagelord1> It had me but that was a little...
[2:58:20] <%Joe2187> DONT LET THEM SPOIL HOODED JUSTICE
[2:58:23] <%ChoculaUltra> I mean, Kojima and his writing team predicted the social media implosion we're faced with today way back in 2002. Writers are prescients who must've hit the spice melange.
[2:58:27] <couch_potato_Ed_Boy> @WoolieVersus How have you not watched this show already?
[2:58:29] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Joe2187
[2:58:30] <%chll0ne> @omegaweltall regina king is amazing
[2:58:33] <Terrarp> Regina King is amazing
[2:58:36] <%optimasmaximas> @Dio_TR i love how your comment was like right below someone hatin on the show lol

[2:58:49] <Dean_Inbetween> When do they get to pink capitalism commentary? PogChamp
[2:58:49] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:58:50] <%LastHazzerd> pandemics
[2:58:50] <%dream__center> mask saves lives erryone
[2:58:58] <They_Call_Me_The_Fizz> @Dio_TR Of course incels hate it... The series calls out Rorschach for the douchebag he truly is
[2:59:02] <Dean_Inbetween> Nazbol gang? :v
[2:59:03] <+TopTieramisu> watch it wooolieeeee
[2:59:05] <%Setsuna_seiei> @skyheys it SOUNDS cool, but the execution in the show imo falls way short. And in the context of watchman personally I don't like it.
[2:59:06] <%chll0ne> yeah its scary how racism in america is basically bred into the minds of many
[2:59:11] <+allups> Watchmen was fucking great
[2:59:12] <couch_potato_Ed_Boy> @WoolieVersus You're missing out, man!
[2:59:13] <+kekkerscrew> This Is Always what Watchmen was about
[2:59:14] <Alexgonzsalsaboy> Woolie you NEED to see it asap
[2:59:15] <%Joe2187> if you see hooded justice turn it off @WoolieVersus its a huge spoiler
[2:59:18] <T_Sasquatch> Regina Kreygasm
[2:59:21] <+j0hnnydonuts> holy fuck
[2:59:24] <PanicSwytch> The show takes place how many years after the comic?
[2:59:26] <%ChoculaUltra> I swear Rorshach is like the Punisher figure for crazy racist DC fans LUL
[2:59:27] <+Superbro64> masked police looks like a scp
[2:59:27] <+HostilePoundcakes> Big Oof
[2:59:28] <+dmadjohn> just arrived, they did Sandman already?
[2:59:31] <%dream__center> reminders
[2:59:32] <revoltingimp> It don't hold back!
[2:59:32] <+allups> good for twitch
[2:59:34] <%LastHazzerd> make yourself uncomfortable
[2:59:35] <Alexgonzsalsaboy> 2019
[2:59:36] <Terrarp> This show was so good. Learned a lot about history too
[2:59:36] <%PadreHail> Like 12 years I think
[2:59:40] <HeroToxiko> @They_Call_Me_The_Fizz it doesn't call out rorschack so much as it calls out the kind of people who identified with him way too much
[2:59:40] <%PadreHail> I forget
[2:59:41] <%optimasmaximas> @ChoculaUltra lmao facts
[2:59:43] <NewWillinium> This feels like a show that would be very very very hard to watch for long. Especially in today's climate
[2:59:45] <countgaculatv> Bruh everyone that slept on this show is because of youtube channels calling the show trash
[2:59:46] <+TopTieramisu> LUL
[2:59:48] <raikagelord1> Might check it out. Seems cool but don‚Äôt know if I will love it.
[2:59:48] <%chll0ne> masks do save lives Kappa
[2:59:52] <countgaculatv> Like memeology101
[2:59:54] <+skyheys> @setsuna_seiei Yeah, but we gotta spin it as deep so people'll watch it. fells bad. :/ I wish a good show went after these ideas.
[2:59:54] <+Dova573> oof
[3:00:02] <They_Call_Me_The_Fizz> I get the feeling they had this concept in the workshop but attached the Watchmen license to it in order to get producers to fund it
[3:00:05] <DonatelloJose> implying it still isn't....
[3:00:06] <%Joe2187> 25 years after OG watchmen book
[3:00:07] <Dean_Inbetween> Huh an oppressive liberal regime, so napoleon?
[3:00:08] <PanicSwytch> PANDAMAN

[3:00:20] <%ChoculaUltra> Yer missing out bruv!
[3:00:21] <%chll0ne> @woolieversus this is how u actually adapt watchmen
[3:00:28] <%Setsuna_seiei> @skyheys woolie would like it, probably.
[3:00:29] <+JoeCoolMaverick> Man, this show seems to lean hard into the "F*** Rorschach camp!". I can get behind that.
[3:00:29] <phatmac16> Surprised you haven‚Äôt watched it
[3:00:30] <+kekkerscrew> Ok Stop Watching this and don't spoil yourself anymore
[3:00:31] <%PadreHail> I think the show personally isn't that great but I also just think it should've been it's own thing
[3:00:43] <%optimasmaximas> OOOOOF
[3:00:43] <Potatoidea> Welp
[3:00:43] <phatmac16> SUPER RELEVANT
[3:00:44] <HeroToxiko> @BananaSlammuh i loved that, he's just a slav with a bat
[3:00:47] <T_Sasquatch> Loooooooooool
[3:00:48] <+allups> watchmen review

[3:00:59] <They_Call_Me_The_Fizz> Woolie getting a LOT of homework today...
[3:01:00] <+j0hnnydonuts> I'm down
[3:01:07] <%ChoculaUltra> Is it that divorced tho? HMMMM?
[3:01:07] <+TopTieramisu> it's a very creative take on watchmen and i hope they don't make another season
[3:01:08] <aaropoll> I'mma go back and watch it again
[3:01:08] <outsidedoubtside> this is basically a finished show since the showrunner was uninterested in a season 2
[3:01:08] <coldfire0007> It ties in the IP
[3:01:09] <T_Sasquatch> Grand Wizards up in here
[3:01:09] <%optimasmaximas> im totally up for this show
[3:01:17] <phatmac16> 4CHAN IS THE REAL VILLIAN

[3:01:19] <%Joe2187> Watch this fucking show
[3:01:25] <%ephie_aka_pulpy> I‚Äôm all in for this show I‚Äôm so excited for it
[3:01:26] <nathaniel_p__> is it just me or is the volume a little low?
[3:01:32] <Deoxislipe> The big problem I heard people having is some comic characters acting uncharacteristically to fit the plot
[3:01:35] <+allups> yeah
[3:01:35] <+TopTieramisu> @outsidedoubtside don't count your chickens. it's not outside the realm of possibility they just give it to a new showrunner
[3:01:37] <+allups> yes
[3:01:39] <%LastHazzerd> the BIBLE
[3:01:39] <%dream__center> da booook
[3:01:40] <%optimasmaximas> OOOHHHHHHH
[3:01:43] <+kekkerscrew> His Manifesto
[3:01:47] <+babyacid> YES!!!
[3:01:47] <PanicSwytch> The Bibble
[3:01:48] <+HostilePoundcakes> NotLikeThis
[3:01:49] <Dean_Inbetween> THE TURNER DIARIES

[3:01:52] <Alexgonzsalsaboy> WOOLIE watch it!! haha
[3:01:53] <%ChoculaUltra> its what would've legit happened.
[3:01:54] <+TopTieramisu> rorsach is qanon
[3:01:58] <Mr_216> there are so many spoilers in this showcase lol
[3:02:03] <%eyezehuhh> woolieGASM
[3:02:05] <phatmac16> SPOILERS
[3:02:05] <+allups> white men and their manifestos
[3:02:05] <Mr_216> but its still a great show to watch anyway
[3:02:13] <HeroToxiko> @TopTieramisu na, fuuuuck
[3:02:16] <Dean_Inbetween> THE FUCKING TURNER DIARIES PogChamp
[3:02:17] <wruce__billis> You guys hear about the sheriff's department in florida which set up a minority report algorithm and uses it to harass the families of black and latino teenagers
[3:02:17] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> It's the Bibble? üî´ It always was
[3:02:20] <+allups> u shouldve been on this woolie
[3:02:22] <Klayton119> I think this series was cancelled
[3:02:23] <spacecatstreams> it's a pretty good series. I think it gets a lil sloppy in the end, but not Westworld season 1 sloppy
[3:02:40] <+TopTieramisu> @HeroToxiko haha, obviously there are differences. i was just being hyperbolic
[3:02:47] <+ArtemisCroc> endings are hard
[3:02:50] <+allups> why would they been talking about it on the fandom if it was canceled
[3:02:53] <Alexgonzsalsaboy> nah it was only 1 season, Damon said he'd only do another season if he had a great idea
[3:02:54] <%ChoculaUltra> It was only a one season thing. iirc the writers themselves didn't plan on having a second season but left the doors open if they had a chance to.
[3:02:55] <+TopTieramisu> endings ARE hard
[3:03:01] <+Superbro64> writing stori3smm3
[3:03:04] <HeroToxiko> it wasn't renewed, till now'
[3:03:10] <+Superbro64> writing good stories at all is hard*
[3:03:19] <Klayton119> @aliup the creator left the show and HBO won't have a second season
[3:03:31] <%ChoculaUltra> You can either have a short and sweet thing like Breaking Bad or die slowly like 24. Pick your poison.
[3:03:35] <%LastHazzerd> so "what if the cops were reformed" is the concept of this series
[3:03:37] <Dean_Inbetween> I love weird politcal ideologies in government form
[3:03:39] <Chatterbox1991> fuckong oooof
[3:03:41] <+j0hnnydonuts> damn it's on HBO?
[3:03:44] <Alexgonzsalsaboy> Woolie this is all spoilers please stop watching
[3:03:46] <%Joe2187> Uh oh
[3:03:47] <phatmac16> Viewership went down early on so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll get renewed
[3:03:47] <+TopTieramisu> breaking bad wasn't even that short, but it fucking hit the landing well
[3:03:49] <Dean_Inbetween> like the LE ETAT UNREALE
[3:03:50] <BedHome> its on amazon streaming in the uk
[3:03:50] <%Bogart4321> INCOMING SPOILERS GUYS
[3:03:50] <+j0hnnydonuts> I don't want another subscription

[3:04:15] <+allups> its allups btw
[3:04:16] <%ChoculaUltra> Reggie and Woolie are IN.
[3:04:16] <T_Sasquatch> Loooool
[3:04:23] <%Mrthefro> Isn't she Riley and Huey LUL
[3:04:29] <%ChoculaUltra> She is!
[3:04:31] <stranger59> Watchmen series is GREAT after reading the trashfire that was Doomsday Clock.
[3:04:34] <+jiggy_snipe> yes she's their voice actor
[3:04:36] <Ashenik1> Vietnam is a USA colony!
[3:04:38] <%FuqBoiSlim> Thats Regina King? nice
[3:04:40] <TheHeroAppears> Sponsored Spoilers LUL
[3:04:47] <prime_name> I like her coat
[3:04:53] <%dream__center> good design
[3:04:56] <NewWillinium> Her Coat is awesome
[3:04:56] <%ChoculaUltra> it is a p sick coat.
[3:04:58] <%eyezehuhh> it's like peaking at the middle of the book. This motivates me to watch it
[3:05:04] <+Lionhart16> pffffft, what was that cut?! XD
[3:05:08] <+allups> yeah alot of it was hard to buy but if u remember the movie it makes more sense
[3:05:09] <spacecatstreams> former-actor president with initials R.R, lol
[3:05:10] <stranger59> @Ashenik1 Vietnam is a full on STATE
[3:05:15] <+BananaSlammuh> Regina King is the standout in this show for sure
[3:05:15] <NewWillinium> Cool Murals
[3:05:17] <HeroToxiko> bruh they're gonna spoil the whole thing LUL
[3:05:20] <+OmegaWeltall> thats right, in this time like the US won the Vientam war
[3:05:26] <+OmegaWeltall> time lline
[3:05:32] <DukeMoose> what was that bus? did the bus have a The Boys ad on it?
[3:05:37] <+TopTieramisu> god dammit the spoilers
[3:05:38] <%dream__center> woah that terrorism
[3:05:42] <CraZ80> Mans really spoiling the whole show for himself EleGiggle
[3:05:42] <Ashenik1> @stranger59 I mean it is but we can also see it as a colony
[3:05:57] <HeroToxiko> @DukeMoose Don't think too hard about that
[3:05:57] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:05:57] <%FuqBoiSlim> @craz80 He still gonna watch it too LUL
[3:06:00] <%ChoculaUltra> its almost as if terrorism was a big part of America's history! Kappa
[3:06:00] <stranger59> @Ashenik1 True
[3:06:01] <+InfiniteAverage> @DukeMoose American Hero Story
[3:06:01] <emeraldskrull> there's no reason to watch the show now
[3:06:01] <They_Call_Me_The_Fizz> HBO Watchmen works because it isn't trying to slavishly navel-gazing and recreate the original books but rather look forward and hit the blindspots that Moore missed...
[3:06:08] <alexandrecau> run away of this losing an argument
[3:06:11] <+Superbro64> I wonder what the writers and actors of this show, and this showcase in general, is viewed in light of 2020 and the newer BLM movement
[3:06:12] <Klayton119> why are people complaining about spoilers.? it's been out already for months
[3:06:13] <stranger59> You'll like it, Woolie
[3:06:14] <+ArtemisCroc> even with the spoilers it's still a great watch
[3:06:15] <BedHome> these spoilers would be the only thing to make me watch the show at all
[3:06:18] <+Superbro64> did they talk about it?
[3:06:19] <prime_name> Also that costume helps hide the stunt actor.
[3:06:20] <+TopTieramisu> woolie is in
[3:06:22] <Terrarp> Hey Woolie, prepare to be blown away by some amazing title drops per episode
[3:06:24] <HeroToxiko> @Klayton119 for woolie LUL
[3:06:26] <NewWillinium> When was this show written? The whole Lower Face Mask thing doesn't really carry the same context it used to
[3:06:29] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> He'll forget by the next thingy
[3:06:30] <+Taglog7> one gets paid
[3:06:32] <%eyezehuhh> @BedHome same!
[3:06:36] <spacecatstreams> god she's so good in the show too
[3:06:38] <Potatoidea> Wasn't there a study that spoilers can make people enjoy things more?
[3:06:39] <+kekkerscrew> The call outs
[3:06:39] <%LastHazzerd> ooof
[3:06:40] <+Superbro64> BLM in regards to police brutality I mean
[3:06:40] <Malik1002> oh NIW ITS OKAY LOL
[3:06:41] <phatmac16> Imagine if this show was airing now lol
[3:06:50] <brachydios777> Hmmmmm
[3:06:51] <%Joe2187> Some of those that work forces! are the ones that burn crossess!
[3:06:53] <+Bailey__gaming> tbh i didnt like some of this show but it was overall good
[3:06:54] <Klayton119> @HeroToxiko he doesn't care and it's still been out for months
[3:06:57] <Alexgonzsalsaboy> it only came out 10 months ago lol
[3:06:57] <+allups> yeah some spoilers are good to get u in
[3:06:59] <%ChoculaUltra> iirc, this was in the oven from 2017-2019? And it came out before the pandemic hit.
[3:07:01] <pirateofpie> Lol
[3:07:03] <+j0hnnydonuts> damn bruh I'm about to have 693958 active subscriptions atpFeelsBeardMan
[3:07:06] <+BananaSlammuh> There's enough interesting pathos and writing that the spoilers won't ruin it. Like any good story
[3:07:06] <HeroToxiko> it was written after the other blm protests but before cov
[3:07:10] <Ashenik1> AND IT WAS PERFECT
[3:07:13] <lylagirl53> You‚Äôll really like it even if it‚Äôs spoiled for you. It‚Äôs a damn good show.
[3:07:15] <Chatterbox1991> WRITTEN BY FUCKING NOSTRADAMUS
[3:07:18] <phatmac16> Just missed the cut
[3:07:20] <+skyheys> @they_call_me_the_fizz Kinda? I feel like it would be stronger as its own thing, merely inspired by it, kinda like Watchmen itself
[3:07:21] <brachydios777> It‚Äôs almost like it‚Äôs really relevant
[3:07:27] <HeroToxiko> like jojo spoilers wont do much i guess
[3:07:44] <NewWillinium> RDR2 Brain: KKK? Time to pull out the Molotovs
[3:07:46] <revoltingimp> the best parts were Ozymandias' fucking about
[3:07:46] <+TopTieramisu> yes it is
[3:07:47] <phatmac16> ‚ÄúThis season‚Äù
[3:07:49] <Twon_From_Wakanda> @WoolieVersus You should check out Lovecraft Country! That show is STRONG!
[3:07:52] <spacecatstreams> aw i was hoping they wouldn't spoil him
[3:07:56] <T_Sasquatch> Ozyyyy
[3:07:56] <%MacabreOpus> Wait y'all ain't seen Watchmen?
[3:07:58] <stranger59> Jeremy Irons is great
[3:07:58] <%ChoculaUltra> Woolie's interest boner has just peaked when Ozy hit the screen.
[3:08:02] <+allups> im just hoping he shares about his thoughts on the podcast
[3:08:05] <brachydios777> Irons is great
[3:08:08] <They_Call_Me_The_Fizz> @skyheys I agree... Sadly, producers nowadays don't bite on stuff that's merely "Inspired By"
[3:08:13] <HeroToxiko> get they ass
[3:08:16] <+babyacid> Irons is transcendent
[3:08:25] <+InfiniteAverage> Woolie i will give you my HBO password if you need it
[3:08:32] <doomsdaydelilah> the original watchmen scripture
[3:08:32] <+TopTieramisu> lots of great performances in the show
[3:08:33] <nathaniel_p__> Lovecraft COuntry is fuckin sick
[3:08:41] <Dean_Inbetween> Power doesn‚Äôt corrupt absolutely it attracts corrupted people SeriousSloth
[3:08:41] <HeroToxiko> @nathaniel_p__ true
[3:08:44] <brachydios777> I don‚Äôt get why people hate this show
[3:08:45] <+skyheys> @they_call_me_the_fizz That and it was kinda cheap anyway. sucks. Wish it could have been done proper.
[3:08:48] <aramus123> @nathaniel_p__ still haven't seen it yet
[3:08:57] <%MacabreOpus> I live to make it through to every Monday just to catch an episode Lovecraft Country
[3:08:58] <+Dova573> yeah its a good show
[3:09:01] <nathaniel_p__> Definitely give it a watch
[3:09:04] <%Joe2187> GET ON THAT SHIt
[3:09:06] <They_Call_Me_The_Fizz> The Hooded Justice retcon made NerdBros SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO ANGRY
[3:09:06] <Alexgonzsalsaboy> Watch it ASAP
[3:09:07] <+BananaSlammuh> The big one wasn't spoiled at least
[3:09:08] <%eyezehuhh> the best showcase so far
[3:09:14] <+AShinyVagikarp> damn i gotta give that a good shot
[3:09:18] <phatmac16> WOOLIE IS IN
[3:09:25] <%Joe2187> You need to watch it
[3:09:25] <%ChoculaUltra> eggecellent.
[3:09:31] <+skyheys> @brachydios777 References for their own sake + iffy script at times. good idea. cwish execution
[3:09:31] <nathaniel_p__> LOVECRAFT COUNTRY, chat. Please watch it so we can get more shows like it
[3:09:34] <+TopTieramisu> it definitely is more thought provoking than the blockbuster supers
[3:09:36] <NewWillinium> I legit don't know if I would be able to watch it at this point in time. Mentally I mean.
[3:09:37] <+babyacid> GET IN!
[3:09:37] <+TopTieramisu> it's*
[3:09:43] <+kekkerscrew> This Show is why the movie made me angry
[3:09:45] <andre11dr> Im definitely intrested now
[3:09:47] <%Joe2187> Its only one season
[3:09:47] <stranger59> The series is one tight story from start to finish.
[3:09:48] <+TopTieramisu> it*
[3:09:52] <+Superbro64> This show did not continue into 2020, yes?
[3:09:58] <raikagelord1> Hmmmmm I think I will give it a shot but it feel like it might be on the Nose and I disagree with somethings but maybe not.
[3:09:59] <+allups> yeah gatta in on that
[3:10:00] <+TopTieramisu> it's a 1 season deal
[3:10:06] <%Bogart4321> glad you wanna watch it
[3:10:07] <coldfire0007> Watchmen was just a couple months too early. Lovecraft Country is just on time
[3:10:07] <+kekkerscrew> The Movie missed out on all of the big ideas in the comic
[3:10:07] <%MacabreOpus> Watchmen is one and done
[3:10:14] <Agami23> doom patrol season 3 got confirmed
[3:10:15] <Alexgonzsalsaboy> Excited to hear his thoughts when he sees it
[3:10:15] <PanicSwytch> Information overload
[3:10:15] <ChoculaUltra> the movie told the story, just not the themes or point. So basically the movie was pointless. Looked nice at parts tho.
[3:10:18] <raikagelord1> Lovecraft country seems cool as well.
[3:10:19] <%Joe2187> The Writer/director left Watchmen show as a limited sereie
[3:10:24] <Dante_Namikaze1> On a lighter note Young Justice Season 4 got announced
[3:10:25] <+babyacid> Reggie do your homework
[3:10:25] <Twon_From_Wakanda> Lovecraft Country is currently the best show on HBO imo
[3:10:29] <brachydios777> @skyheys I kinda get that, but the good stuff is really good, especially the Dream/Flashback episode
