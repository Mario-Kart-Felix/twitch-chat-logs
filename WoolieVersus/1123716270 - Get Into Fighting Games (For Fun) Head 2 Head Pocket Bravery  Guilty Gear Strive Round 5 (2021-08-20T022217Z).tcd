[0:00:03] <leith_aziz> @Applecannon63 You mean MK strings? I don't really like that myself. That could be a Ram thing only.

[0:00:50] <Applecannon63> @leith_aziz they could be command normals kinda like how Nago has on which FS
[0:00:54] <iacus_> TBF most people make it to late game very poorly spec'd
[0:00:54] <%Josef_Stryker> @leith_aziz That's my point. Anything anime just gets an arena fighter thanks to Naruto starting the trend
[0:00:56] <%MutedMimic> woolieSPICE woolieSPICE
[0:00:58] <@Menitta> I dont know why I keep doing it to myself but I always look at anime arena fighters and think "MAYBE ITLL BE GOOD"
[0:01:01] <%CaptainPileDriver> wish that logo was available to buy
[0:01:05] <VoltageXXII> Usually I never make it live to streams and I always watch on Youtube. But I saw Strive(PC) and knew I had to be here for this
[0:01:05] <@Menitta> and its fuckin not

[0:01:31] <+kullumanati> Don’t delete
[0:01:31] <Goldteddy> @Menitta that's like people buying 2k wrestling games. Maybe this one will be good or atleast run....
[0:01:32] <%Noonoox12> Being a first-time fighting game player and nago main, watching woolie player nago is SUPER helpful
[0:01:34] <anAngryHamster> Where's Nickelodeon Smash!?
[0:01:46] <%dds333a> @irridium and even at the time, they were around LUL
[0:01:48] <@Menitta> I wanted to like that MHA game....
[0:02:00] <leith_aziz> @Menitta Sorry to hear that
[0:02:20] <NotHereToStream> so who will be dlc 1 for strive
[0:02:21] <@Menitta> I need to look at my replays more. every time I do, I see every mistake I made
[0:02:33] <%Juriasu> Arcsys is working on some sort of anime based game as a sort of sequel to dbfz, if you believe the rumors
[0:02:33] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1414834352052215808?s=19
[0:02:41] <leith_aziz> I usually just go for it and dont care how I've been doing
[0:02:42] <%dds333a> Gotta love replays that go frame by frame
[0:02:47] <leith_aziz> I just go out and play Sol and Chipp
[0:02:54] <harpsichord_uiy> so excited to watch the game evolve
[0:03:02] <leith_aziz> Lose or win, I'll play with Sol and go unga
[0:03:05] <+TitanGigante> @NotHereToStream really hope it's goldlewis, I have a mod I wanna do
[0:03:21] <Applecannon63> I think Deku's projectile move were inspired by Potemkin

[0:03:28] <BackwardCap> Didnt SonicFox main Hit?
[0:03:30] <%Juriasu> NO ONE escapes
[0:03:35] <%CaptainPileDriver> god this first dlc can't come fast enough
[0:03:36] <Daniel_Is_I> You don't
[0:03:37] <%Juriasu> but no gold burst
[0:03:41] <%Irridium> You escape when she blasts you through the wall
[0:03:43] <%Juriasu> or YRC
[0:03:48] <+RemedyofRevenge> Speaking of Ram, I've been trying to learn her corner pressure
[0:04:01] <+TitanGigante> @NotHereToStream replace all his voice lines with Doug Dimmadome, and put Doug's La Cucaracha car horn over one of his supers, whatever they end up being
[0:04:04] <leith_aziz> @NotHereToStream im curious why Max finds him that interesting to want to become playable. I guess its the coffin thing. Goldlewis's cool but I wouldnt mind Happy Chaos
[0:04:07] <%CaptainPileDriver> @Irridium you get out when the round starts and she blasts you through the wall from the middle of the stage

[0:04:22] <%Juriasu> thank god
[0:04:22] <NotHereToStream> @TitanGigante thats brilliant
[0:04:24] <Solidnick18> yeah
[0:04:28] <wiffernubbin> gotta make an excel sheet
[0:04:31] <leith_aziz> I found out a lot of games do that apparently
[0:04:31] <%dds333a> Weird
[0:04:33] <iacus_> Probably for the best
[0:04:37] <harpsichord_uiy> i'd be so disheartened if they showed my w/l ratio tbh
[0:04:38] <%Noonoox12> I really wish it would. I'm trash and I wanna SEE HOW woolieTRASH I AM!
[0:04:41] <%Josef_Stryker> I'd rather not see the ratio
[0:04:44] <+SaurianCrash> yo woolie
[0:04:44] <%jolene_orenji> No but you're SO WINNING THO
[0:04:45] <%JojoAndTheAfroRobo> One day someone will have a third party tracker for Strive
[0:04:46] <Applecannon63> So that Elpthet
[0:04:48] <leith_aziz> According to comments, it seems like stats arent gonna help you a lot
[0:04:49] <%Josef_Stryker> I get so salty thinking about it in SFV
[0:04:52] <%dds333a> I'd love to see the W/L
[0:04:53] <%Juriasu> I don't want to see my 40% win record or something just because Millia is made out of paper

[0:05:15] <Applecannon63> WE NEED SHAME MECHANICS
[0:05:20] <NotHereToStream> @leith_aziz perhaps its the fact goldlewis is the japanese overdesigned stereotype of an american that its somewhat charming
[0:05:28] <leith_aziz> But yeah, I myself dont like seeing my winrate %. It just demotivates me
[0:05:32] <Solidnick18> i suppose
[0:05:34] <+TitanGigante> I like the sheriffy burger man

[0:05:42] <%holydeviant1> You're AN authority
[0:05:43] <Applecannon63> American stereotype in anime is funny
[0:05:59] <+RemedyofRevenge> @WoolieVersus I hope Bridget makes it into Strive in the future. Btw is there any desire to play the new Ultrakill update in the future?

[0:06:22] <@Menitta> I'm sorry what
[0:06:22] <leith_aziz> @NotHereToStream I guess. I do wanna see how much he'll cover the screen and how his coffin gameplay would look like. Also wanna hear more of that Strive OST banger

[0:07:30] <NotHereToStream> chipp is a crackfiend, he will come at you
[0:07:32] <%Irridium> tfw you try to zone chip but he blocks and dashes on you faster than you can recover
[0:07:39] <leith_aziz> You cant stop me from landing that command grab
[0:07:40] <Applecannon63> CHIPP BANZAI
[0:07:42] <%Juriasu> yeah you just do press the button before you even decide if pressing it was a good idea or not

[0:08:06] <%Irridium> Chip players' half-light is STACKED
[0:08:10] <%CaptainPileDriver> alpha blade -squints to see which one to block or jab correctly-
[0:08:10] <%Juriasu> Chipp is even worse on console I bet, how would you even react to that
[0:08:11] <Applecannon63> FUJIYAMA GEISHA
[0:08:13] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Pot vs Chipp is a 6-4 matchup for nobody.
[0:08:16] <+TitanGigante> being on the potemkin side of things it's like that scene of Saitama trying to swat a mosquito
[0:08:19] <JetpackMcQuack> Don't miss chipp
[0:08:19] <leith_aziz> BANZAAAAAIIII
[0:08:23] <+timtomkitkat> Chipp players just built different
[0:08:25] <%CaptainPileDriver> you can black everything and chipp will still win

[0:13:10] <%dds333a> @leith_aziz sure, but it seems like Mori just wanted to make his own shotz which in many ways is derivative of GG
[0:13:14] <leith_aziz> @Irridium Basically me with Xrd Rev 2: Love that game and want to go back to it, but the delay based netcode makes me sad

[0:35:15] <Dragon_Batman> There's always potential but who knows
[0:35:33] <%JojoAndTheAfroRobo> i like the negative space use of the 3D red. after seeing it now i feel that it makes everything pop out while being subtle in the background
[0:35:34] <2017y> sound design is v good
[0:35:45] <%dds333a> Jab combos strong LUL
[0:35:58] <2017y> reminds me a lot of fexl for gameplay

[0:38:07] <%Afterman_> yo this game looks so fun
[0:38:08] <bluphoenixxv> woolieCHAN
[0:38:29] <Dragon_Batman> This does look like it controls well too
[0:38:33] <2017y> fexl has the same thing where you dial your own combo by canceling into stuff
[0:38:36] <kotl7> what are the pips under the lifebars?
[0:38:37] <Cynical2DD> Why hasn’t the new podcast episode been uploaded on apple podcast?
[0:38:37] <%dds333a> Woah, this track TOO?
[0:38:46] <+arcforged> The pips under the lifebars are auto burst
[0:38:53] <+arcforged> 10 hits = auto burst
[0:38:57] <+arcforged> unless you use a skull skill
[0:39:05] <kotl7> oh ok
[0:39:07] <Dragon_Batman> Oh that to prevent possible infinites?
[0:39:10] <%Juriasu> ah interesting
[0:39:11] <+arcforged> Yep
[0:39:16] <Dragon_Batman> Neat
[0:39:17] <anarchistPastry> why's the mario enemy complaining about being Cheep?
[0:39:29] <%SaurianCrash> ha

[0:41:27] <%Sparkseid> This is dope as hell
[0:41:33] <%dds333a> Almost timed out woolieGASM
[0:41:37] <Dave_VD> That old Sagat tech

[0:43:05] <+fetrigon> try parrying the projectiles
[0:43:09] <WeepyDevil> ill be honest looking at this kinda hurts me eyes
[0:43:17] <JinJun1738> ^
[0:43:19] <Dave_VD> Yeah we haven't seen any parries
[0:43:20] <+arcforged> You can change the background color
[0:43:21] <WeepyDevil> not a fan of the red background
[0:43:22] <JinJun1738> 😔
[0:43:23] <+arcforged> In the settings
[0:43:24] <%VoltageXXII> It's like the Virtual Boy
[0:43:30] <+Mordexai_> @weepydevil you can change the background color in settings
[0:43:30] <2017y> LoOkS LiKe PeRsOnA 5 MuCh?!
[0:43:33] <bluphoenixxv> oh cool
[0:43:39] <Abzelic> @Applecannon63 Nah, blender monk is a lot thinner
[0:43:44] <+arcforged> @WoolieVersus Change the background color in the settings
[0:43:57] <%dds333a> @woolieversus apparently, the background color can be altered, just as a heads yp
[0:44:01] <WeepyDevil> are there actual different characters?
[0:44:14] <WeepyDevil> or are the heads jsut cosmetic
[0:44:14] <+Mordexai_> @weepydevil Different Heads
[0:44:17] <2017y> persona5 invented red
[0:44:17] <+arcforged> There will be 12 fighting styles in total
[0:44:18] <%SaurianCrash> you mean move sets
[0:44:28] <+arcforged> This one is the shoto
[0:44:43] <%dds333a> @2017y Undoubtedly woolieMIRIN
[0:44:44] <+Mordexai_> @weepydevil Heads are gonna have different abilities if I remember
[0:44:47] <+Jiggisnipe> 12 functions Kappa
[0:44:53] <+arcforged> Stats, abilities and effects
[0:44:54] <+Mordexai_> nevermind @arcforged said it
[0:45:04] <WeepyDevil> yeah, i mean movesets, in 95% of fighting games different characetrs would mean different movesets
[0:45:28] <%dds333a> It's like Hulk
[0:45:29] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:45:33] <+Mordexai_> yes it seems
[0:45:38] <Dave_VD> They said you get 10 hits with an EX at the end before the combo automatically ends
[0:45:58] <bluphoenixxv> what's motivated do?
[0:46:01] <+arcforged> Game
[0:46:04] <+arcforged> In Game
[0:46:06] <%dds333a> That's an Alieeeen

[0:46:27] <Dave_VD> Yooo look at all those colors hell yeah
[0:46:27] <WeepyDevil> i'd play in grey
[0:46:34] <WeepyDevil> nice and easy on the eyes
[0:46:39] <bluphoenixxv> good lord that head
[0:46:40] <%SaurianCrash> grey is the meta
[0:46:44] <Dragon_Batman> The yellow was actually nice, I never usually go for that too
[0:46:44] <%dds333a> Maybe a less harsh color for those who prefer something less garish, yeah
[0:46:44] <%Sparkseid> easier on the eyes
[0:46:49] <%RealThiele> Mister Game n' Watch
[0:46:52] <Prevot> we game & watch now
[0:46:54] <Dragon_Batman> Wow Jimmy Bones? nice

[0:47:20] <Prevot> wait so there is actually a stage
[0:47:21] <2017y> i would have made it darker not brighter haha
[0:47:26] <%athuramn> that training session just made Reggie stronger
[0:47:32] <iacus_> do the different heads have different moves?
[0:47:34] <2017y> mii brawler fighting game
[0:47:40] <JinJun1738> The music catJAM
[0:47:42] <%dds333a> The Monk Skeleton of Head2Head is always present
[0:47:44] <+arcforged> That was auto burst 10 hits
[0:47:51] <+arcforged> Skull moves reset that meter
[0:48:07] <WeepyDevil> or you can go skullgirls style i guess
[0:48:10] <%dds333a> Ooh, the interrupt
[0:48:12] <Abzelic> @CheyMix Now that you mention it, that'd be a cool guest character.
[0:48:18] <WeepyDevil> drop your combo at 9 and go for a reset, conserve skulls
[0:48:18] <Dave_VD> @arcforged So you could do near a 50 hit combo?
[0:48:25] <+arcforged> You can do an infinite
[0:48:27] <+tnhgameremixes> @JinJun1738 Thanks lol
[0:48:28] <+arcforged> if you have enough skulls
[0:48:41] <+tnhgameremixes> and yeah skulls are good but you can't use them all up at once
[0:48:43] <Dave_VD> Sick, cool game

[0:58:19] <bluphoenixxv> well said
[0:58:22] <%RealThiele> LUL
[0:58:28] <+arcforged> You can prevent the auto burst by using a skull move
[0:58:41] <kotl7> yo the air shmovement
[0:58:48] <%LordJimmyBones> for longer combos
[0:58:54] <%LordJimmyBones> and juggles
[0:58:55] <%Juriasu> he did it right away LUL
[0:58:57] <%dds333a> That's how you extend it, then
[0:59:04] <%LordJimmyBones> yes
[0:59:07] <%Sparkseid> they do be schmovin
[0:59:18] <+arcforged> Skull moves are OTGs too
[0:59:21] <+arcforged> the initial burst
[0:59:25] <%RealThiele> instant punish
[0:59:32] <bluphoenixxv> gotta use those skulls sparingly
[0:59:41] <higthekid> we here

[0:59:43] <+senfood> STOP TRYING TO HIT ME AND HIT ME
[0:59:46] <+tnhgameremixes> Skull moves are glorious but if you wanna save it up no shame in taking the burst
[0:59:51] <%VoltageXXII> The staredown!
[1:00:04] <Applecannon63> Yo who'a sentai head design!?

[1:00:13] <+arcforged> There's sentais
[1:00:17] <+arcforged> 3 of em
[1:00:23] <%dds333a> Gameranx proven wrong AGAIN
[1:00:41] <CallMeFlufflez> is one of them a rider?
[1:00:41] <Applecannon63> any Kamen Rider inspired heads?
[1:00:52] <+arcforged> Not yet, we plan on adding 50 more heads
[1:00:56] <Applecannon63> whether its Ichigo's?
[1:01:06] <bazz_tv> Is this a make yuor character kind of fighter?
[1:01:12] <CallMeFlufflez> so 50 goku heads then
[1:01:13] <+arcforged> Not exactly
[1:01:13] <+xiccy> are there OTGs? cause it looks like it
[1:01:17] <+arcforged> Our next game will be like that
[1:01:21] <+arcforged> Yes there are OTGs
[1:01:28] <+arcforged> Certain moves have floor bounce and OTG
[1:01:34] <+senfood> @arcforged Looking forward to seeing what other heads are coming out!
[1:01:44] <%dds333a> @bazz_tv inasmuch as you can customize your head LUL
[1:01:45] <bazz_tv> Wow dev in chat?
[1:01:50] <Arisato_II> Skulls for the skull cancels
[1:01:56] <+tnhgameremixes> There's gonna be a lotta them with a lotta effects and stuff
[1:01:59] <+arcforged> You can join our discord. I show updates regularly as we're actively working on this
[1:02:00] <Dragon_Batman> This is really kool
[1:02:19] <+Kullnes> art style looks rad
[1:02:21] <bluphoenixxv> oh the skulls have a cool down after using them
[1:02:38] <captainpooka> LUL
[1:02:42] <%Sparkseid> best song in the game for me
[1:02:49] <%dds333a> @bazz_tv and composer too: @tnhgameremixes
[1:02:50] <kotl7> I just noticed the screenshake lol it's going wild and adding a lot of punch
[1:03:11] <+arcforged> We took the screenshake inspiration from marvel
[1:03:31] <kotl7> how so?
[1:03:32] <%dds333a> Woah, the side switch on that SeemsGood

[1:03:38] <+Kullnes> the slight delay before they get hit and fly off looks really good too
[1:03:49] <+arcforged> It rotates around the camera center rather than up and down like an earthquake
[1:03:51] <+senfood> I'm digging the screenshake. Gives the moves oomph.
[1:03:59] <+arcforged> So the characters stay stationary
[1:04:10] <kotl7> oh ok, pretty smart
[1:04:11] <%dds333a> Geeeeeez
[1:04:14] <kotl7> keeps it lisible
[1:04:19] <bazz_tv> The background colors in contrast to the characters makes me think of newgrounds
[1:04:20] <@Solidus_113> yES!
[1:04:21] <Applecannon63> reasonable static poses
[1:04:26] <%RealThiele> back to the pit

[1:05:34] <+arcforged> Versus settings will be in a future update
[1:05:37] <kotl7> @dds333a only if it's visible
[1:05:38] <Applecannon63> Deku Flavor
[1:05:39] <+arcforged> where you can set HP and starting skulls
[1:06:00] <Applecannon63> One for All Deku Flavor
[1:06:01] <%dds333a> good use of the teleport woolieMIRIN
[1:06:08] <+arcforged> And you can choose music and other settings
[1:06:13] <kotl7> @arcforged can you gain skulls in match? with parry maybe?
[1:06:13] <+tnhgameremixes> @higthekid Lmfao main that one but i also main LFGOOOOOO
[1:06:33] <+arcforged> You cant currently gain skulls mid match, thats definitely something to think about
[1:06:34] <%RealThiele> Koopy sandwich head
[1:06:45] <kotl7> ok thx
[1:06:46] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:06:47] <+fetrigon> @arcforged what's
[1:06:58] <+arcforged> You DO gain skulls from survival mode
[1:07:00] <+fetrigon> *your goal with this game?
[1:07:00] <+arcforged> per win
[1:07:06] <+arcforged> and you can use those to roll for skulls
[1:07:24] <Applecannon63> Make those head spin
[1:07:32] <+TheDooms> I think he meant the skull charges mid-fight, I think? Man, I gotta play this more.
[1:07:36] <+TheDooms> I think I will tonight
[1:07:38] <+arcforged> Our ultimate goal is rollback, 12 fighting styles, android release, head stats, effects and ability changes
[1:07:39] <%dds333a> The prediction on Woolie, at least it was there LUL
[1:07:55] <+arcforged> Heads will have slots, like FF's materia system
[1:07:57] <%Mrthefro> What the fuck is this LUL
[1:08:01] <+arcforged> and all the stats will be "Skullterias"
[1:08:03] <WeepyDevil> holy shit that hitbox
[1:08:05] <+fetrigon> @arcforged SICK KomodoHype
[1:08:07] <Abzelic> ngl I kinda wish skulls reset to 5 each round. but that's just me
[1:08:08] <%dds333a> Baloney Kappa
[1:08:19] <Applecannon63> Okay Skullterias sounds adorable
[1:08:33] <+tnhgameremixes> Bruh if you mad low on health and you got skulls fk it spam some lol
[1:08:40] <@Solidus_113> is there a reason for getting already owned heads?
[1:08:48] <+arcforged> Yes, to Star them up
[1:08:48] <CallMeFlufflez> I've heard a few thing from JSR in the music
[1:08:52] <bluphoenixxv> any information you can give in the other project you spoke of @arcforged?
[1:08:53] <+arcforged> to give them more slots
[1:08:57] <@Solidus_113> neat
[1:09:16] <+arcforged> The create a fighter? It'll be "Echoes of the Spirit" a platform fighter
[1:09:27] <+Taisuru> So the skulls are a limited stock of armored moves?
[1:09:29] <+arcforged> 8 fighting styles, you can pick your skin and your element
[1:09:41] <bluphoenixxv> oh what elements
[1:09:56] <+tnhgameremixes> oo echoes platform fighter huh? based!
[1:09:58] <+arcforged> Fire, Earth, Wind, Water, Lightning, Ice, Spacetime

[1:10:14] <+senfood> Spacetime sounds rad af
[1:10:15] <kotl7> lol spacetime is an element?!
[1:10:19] <+tnhgameremixes> platform fighters are a super interesting genre to tackle
[1:10:20] <+arcforged> Sure.
[1:10:21] <bluphoenixxv> duh
[1:10:22] <+arcforged> lol
[1:10:29] <kotl7> acceptable response
[1:10:31] <%dds333a> Going even further beyond, Woolie is
[1:10:32] <kotl7> LUL
[1:10:36] <Applecannon63> Space time obviously OP
[1:10:36] <+arcforged> Gravity makes the fabric of the universe
[1:10:38] <+TheDooms> @arcforged I thought Echoes of the Spirit was a traditional fighter?
[1:10:47] <+arcforged> We changed it up.
[1:10:53] <+arcforged> Origin of Storms will be return to form
[1:10:55] <+senfood> Ultra Instiinct Woolie Drip
[1:11:01] <%townzzzzz> knock his damn head off
[1:11:03] <+TheDooms> I see. Then I've uh...I've got things to do
[1:11:05] <+Taisuru> Personally I think wind and lightning should be one but if you've got the design space for more I won't complain :V
[1:11:07] <+tnhgameremixes> This sounds extremely exciting @arcforged
[1:11:09] <%dds333a> jab combos KevinTurtle
[1:11:15] <%Afterman_> @arcforged any chance of extrr colors being added? The lightest purple isn't pink enough for me lol
[1:11:18] <%Afterman_> extra*
[1:11:20] <%VoltageXXII> If I might make a suggestion. The colors and the aesthetic are rad. But I'm a bit worried about eye strain from looking at some of it too long, especially the red.
[1:11:26] <%jolene_orenji> can you pet the dog in Head2Head?
[1:11:37] <+arcforged> @Afterman_ We're gonna have a DLC later where you can have RGB sliders and save your own colors
[1:11:43] <%dds333a> @jolene_orenji just you wait Kappa
[1:11:58] <%Afterman_> @arcforged thats an instant purchase for me! Thank you!!
[1:12:00] <+senfood> One head lets you return to monke but can you also regret?
[1:12:01] <+arcforged> If you unlock DOGE in head 2 head, you can definitely pet it
[1:12:02] <%VoltageXXII> Nevermind. That answers me too. xD
[1:12:05] <+arcforged> by punching it in the face

[1:15:58] <%Afterman_> prismatic is definitely a strong cosmetic option, cant deny
[1:16:01] <KaiserMario> Woolie playing with the iconic Sims character
[1:16:36] <%dds333a> The recovery on that super was pretty damn fast, woah
[1:16:47] <%Juriasu> LUL
[1:17:01] <%Sparkseid> I WILL
[1:17:10] <+tnhgameremixes> Parries are super satisfying to land
[1:17:44] <%dds333a> There's the OTG
[1:17:48] <higthekid> certain setups allow you to parry/punish burst
[1:17:56] <higthekid> well auto burst
[1:18:09] <%Juriasu> @higthekid whoa tech?
[1:18:17] <+arcforged> The game has a lot of tech
[1:18:21] <higthekid> ^
[1:18:21] <meinukey> can't parry burst anymore on this patch
[1:18:21] <+arcforged> and its super easy to pick up
[1:18:24] <higthekid> I love it
[1:18:50] <higthekid> rip parry burst
[1:18:56] <%dds333a> Ooh, nice
[1:19:05] <%Juriasu> can you trigger the burst with the projectile and then punish the burst after or something like that?
[1:19:11] <+arcforged> Yes
[1:19:15] <%Juriasu> oh god
[1:19:52] <%dds333a> Woolie using the limits of the screen to his advantage LUL
[1:21:26] <bluphoenixxv> almost turned it around
[1:21:26] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1414834352052215808?s=19

[1:23:03] <BackwardCap> DOOMBOX gildedNut
[1:23:04] <%dds333a> Here we go
[1:23:26] <+Mrbaconator> @noonoox12 i just checked the name you said is already ther? new sock smell
[1:23:46] <kotl7> @arcforged is the screen scrolling a bit late, as in after the combos, a conscious choice to allow more corner combos without actually being in the corner?
[1:24:19] <+arcforged> The camera is modeled after Marvel's camera scroll style
[1:24:26] <%dds333a> DP country out here
[1:24:39] <+arcforged> It definitely gives you the feeling that you're in a corner
[1:25:14] <%dds333a> Straight out the gate LUL
[1:25:24] <%dds333a> Although, Reg did that last time Kappa
[1:25:32] <kotl7> yeah it feels like you're always back to the corner, but there's always more space behind, it's an interesting choice, sorry if my first question was not clear lol
[1:26:17] <kotl7> it's just feels like it's hard to know when you're actually in the corner
[1:26:29] <kotl7> at least visually
[1:26:35] <%dds333a> The round intros never end LUL
[1:26:59] <+Mordexai_> How many Round Intros are there?
[1:27:01] <+arcforged> There's over 00 intro quotes lol
[1:27:05] <%dds333a> Woolie kept him honest with that projectile, damn
[1:27:08] <+arcforged> 300*
[1:27:15] <+arcforged> And growing
[1:27:17] <+Mordexai_> @arcforged Holy Crap
[1:27:21] <tolloponik> @kotl7 it seems like you are in the corner until the combo is over
[1:27:21] <%athuramn> lmao
[1:27:24] <Dragon_Batman> Dayum
[1:27:25] <+arcforged> Open to early access people and patrons
[1:27:40] <kotl7> @tolloponik yeah that's why I was asking about it
[1:27:53] <%dds333a> A TALE OF
[1:28:16] <kotl7> but it's pretty cool because you can do corner combos anywhere
[1:28:53] <+Mordexai_> Where's the 'It's Saturday Night, I have no date, a two-liter bottle of Shasta and my all-Rush mix-tape' Round Intro? LOL
[1:28:53] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:28:58] <tolloponik> yeah Its a really good design decision
[1:29:09] <meinukey> not true corner combos but you get wallbounces against the camera edges anywhere, yeah
[1:29:12] <meinukey> just like marvel
[1:29:18] <+arcforged> yep
[1:29:30] <kotl7> oh ok when you say marvel you're talking about the games?
[1:29:32] <+arcforged> Meinukry is also the other dev

[2:38:38] <+ReallyBigRocks> It's like I'm at a Buckethead concert
[2:39:00] <%Juriasu> I don't remember seeing it today actually
[2:39:07] <%Juriasu> I might be wrong
[2:39:18] <%dds333a> Figuring it out is something Woolie does Kappa
[2:39:42] <BackwardCap> No Ndidi lvl 3 gildedCry
[2:39:42] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:39:46] <+ReallyBigRocks> what even is time?
[2:39:50] <+Cuon_Alpinus> doesnt that imply they'll never be fixed
[2:39:58] <%RealThiele> Ndidi will be level 3 in our hearts
[2:40:03] <weasnot> GUN FRAME
[2:40:23] <Hericknhx> so hyped for the DLC on the 20th
[2:40:34] <+arcforged> That one is hype
[2:40:37] <+arcforged> and the devs are cool
[2:41:13] <+Moikazzz> wait this game is from a brazillian developer?! leet's goo, something to be proud of ;')
[2:41:43] <%Juriasu> LUL
[2:42:17] <%Juriasu> Windows is so weird sometimes it assumes that one output device has higher priority that others
[2:42:23] <weasnot> DLC in three days? Nice.
[2:42:40] <Hericknhx> the trailer at least @weasnot
[2:42:40] <bigshedman> We on PC again?
[2:42:43] <%Juriasu> yeyeye
[2:42:44] <+a_meat_man> just booted it up, over 2 minutes till I got to menu
[2:42:44] <WeepyDevil> mgs ladder
[2:42:46] <BlackermanZX> you can finish castlevania Harmony of dissonance
[2:42:50] <%Irridium> Everyone in the world connecting to 1 server in Japan
[2:42:52] <%Afterman_> harmony of dissonance
[2:42:52] <Daniel_Is_I> Also a speedrun of Super Mario 64
[2:42:53] <%Juriasu> I saw the mario 64 one
[2:42:53] <%jolene_orenji> man I really hope they fix this in a future patch it's really bad
[2:42:54] <%Afterman_> JUSTE the goat
[2:43:02] <OkamiDude15> mgs ladder, green hill zone, super mario 64 TAS
[2:43:02] <weasnot> OhMyDog
[2:43:07] <%jinking79> doodLUL
[2:43:14] <BackwardCap> "You can do XYZ before you boot Strive" is a meme.
[2:43:16] <NotHereToStream> 1st bowser boss in 64
[2:43:17] <+Cuon_Alpinus> Gotta connect to Jappan 50 times
[2:43:18] <+fetrigon> what a thrill...
[2:43:18] <WeepyDevil> yeah i don't play Strive cause of this loading
[2:43:18] <BlackermanZX> also uou can finish the first bowser stage in super mario 64
[2:43:30] <DedlokPM> I saw the Super Mario 64 Skip to the Bowser fight one
[2:43:31] <WeepyDevil> the lobbies AND this loading time? nope, idgaf, ill play something else
[2:43:32] <tolloponik> is this bloodborn load times WTF
[2:43:33] <%kewlmyc> None will be fixed and you know it.
[2:43:37] <%BisoromiBear> how many unpatched bloodborne loading screens does it take to get into guilty gear?
[2:43:43] <SpookyBeef7> There's honestly so many things that need to be fixed, but I'm worried ArcSys won't bother getting to them until well after EVO.
[2:43:54] <%VoltageXXII> Strive really makes the getting into part of Get Into Fighting Games difficult.
[2:44:02] <%Juriasu> they even had pictures of sticks plugged in and strive being played, valve knows lol
[2:44:11] <%jinking79> sure the ps5 can skip it but stilp bad
[2:44:15] <yukichocomilk> the lobbies suck but I still have a lot of fun with the game, it's great
[2:44:39] <NotHereToStream> steamdeck, the meltyblood machine for evo
[2:44:46] <%Irridium> so will steam decks outlast the steam machines? or Steam link? Any takers?
[2:44:51] <+Superbro64> TO's buying like $400 "pc machines" for tournies, instead of using the already existing ps4s floating around, doesnt sound economical. ESPECIALLY if Strive's PS5 latency is a sign of things to come @woolieversus
[2:45:01] <%Juriasu> ding ding dong
[2:45:11] <%KetsuoTaberu> left channel right channel
[2:45:15] <+ReallyBigRocks> stream in mono confirmed
[2:45:21] <+JustToWatch> Did Woolie talk about the rumored Persona 4 Arena Ultimax remaster?
[2:45:34] <+Superbro64> I do wonder if there is any issue with using pc setups already @woolieversus
[2:45:39] <%Irridium> I mean tourneys using the worse console for a game isn't exactly unheard of
[2:45:43] <weasnot> Oh wow.
[2:45:45] <+Superbro64> before the steam deck announcement was a thing
[2:45:48] <WeepyDevil> @JustToWatch no because no credible sources afaik
[2:46:08] <Cymen90> Steam Deck is the best Melty Blood Bathroom Tech! @WoolieVersus
[2:46:08] <%Juriasu> I really want pc to be the main platform, but imagine setting every station with good pcs and probably expensive monitors
[2:46:36] <+JustToWatch> the limited memory of the base model isn't great for tournaments though
[2:46:49] <%Juriasu> it's already sold out I think, scalpers are already going ham
[2:46:49] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1414834352052215808?s=19
[2:46:57] <+Superbro64> Question from someone with ZERO to experience: do TO's buy new ps4s? Do they use existing ones? how does that work? @woolieversus
[2:47:11] <+Superbro64> is this something they consider in tournament budgets? Im curious
[2:47:22] <WeepyDevil> if at all possible obviously you'll be using used ones
[2:47:22] <+Jiggisnipe> maybe Valve will be different this time since they advertised Strive on the Steam Deck site
[2:47:24] <Cymen90> There were no tests yet. No benchmarks, only estimates based on known hardware! @WoolieVersus
[2:47:31] <%Irridium> Arcsys games don't use a lot of space though so that's nice
[2:47:33] <WeepyDevil> its not like you get new ones for tournaments
[2:47:43] <WeepyDevil> TOs just have a supply
[2:47:54] <%Juriasu> best case scenario would be to get hp omen as a sponsor or something similar, but that would be a pretty huge investment for them for probably low return
[2:48:16] <linSP> isn’t storage the only difference between decks?
[2:48:24] <%jolene_orenji> guess I gotta get used to 5 frames for tourneys FeelsBadMan
[2:48:24] <+Superbro64> @weepydevil I wonder if TOs talk to each other to figure out what the supply is, or where they get it. If they share ps4s, etc.
[2:48:47] <%jolene_orenji> smash literally zipties them to the docks
[2:48:50] <+Jiggisnipe> I heard they have lockboxes or something
[2:48:54] <+JustToWatch> someone said they use zipties
[2:49:00] <Cymen90> Good thing this is a niche problem. I have never seen an Arcade in my life. Except for the Video Game Museum in Berlin
[2:49:01] <Demoli_PT> you can just tie them to the docks
[2:49:01] <+Superbro64> Reminder that Strive is crossplay PS4 and PS5, and ps5 has more latency then ps4
[2:49:08] <ItsEzKill> zipties, boxes
[2:49:22] <%Irridium> @Superbro64 and crossplay's coming with PC that's gonna be fun
[2:49:29] <+JustToWatch> I wonder if the PS5 latency is something that can be improved with a patch
[2:49:30] <+Superbro64> not sure *how much* latency, but I imagine that matters
[2:49:44] <%jolene_orenji> I feel like this is the first fighting game ever that has been objectively better on PC
[2:49:49] <WeepyDevil> @Irridium have we gotten any confirmation for that?
[2:49:50] <+Superbro64> @irridium hidethepainharold.png
[2:49:57] <+ReallyBigRocks> @JustToWatch It's gotta be if the PS4 version is better on PS5
[2:50:04] <%jinking79> new character in like 3 days now
[2:50:06] <WeepyDevil> or ist it still "we'll look into that" as the only source
[2:50:12] <+Superbro64> eyyyyy
[2:50:13] <%Juriasu> THERE HE IS
[2:50:15] <%AlteisenReiseZ> AYYYYY
[2:50:16] <SpookyBeef7> Oh shit!
[2:50:16] <+Superbro64> nice!
[2:50:18] <%townzzzzz> got them mods working
[2:50:22] <%jolene_orenji> time to fuck the game up with a bunch of mods PogChamp
[2:50:23] <Thunderhog> That's some good shit
[2:50:25] <@Solidus_113> LUL Octo
[2:50:26] <NotHereToStream> cool
[2:50:28] <%jolene_orenji> SNAP INTO A SLIM JIM
[2:50:30] <passserby> CREAM OF THE CROP
[2:50:31] <%Juriasu> Axl PogChamp
[2:50:33] <%Josef_Stryker> Is that a modded colour?
[2:50:33] <%Irridium> @WeepyDevil yeah in a recent interview Arcsys said they're in the process of certification or something similar. translation was weird but it is coming
[2:50:37] <+JustToWatch> STEAMED HAMS
[2:50:38] <primaryfire> gangster's paradise during HPB
[2:50:39] <+Mrbaconator> octo adds MORE MODS EVERY STREAM and it is GLORIOUS
[2:50:40] <bigshedman> Arcsys mentioned something a few days ago about being in the submission process for crossplay.
[2:50:42] <%Irridium> LUL
[2:50:45] <Saltmeisterr> WE REACHED THE BOILING POINT
[2:50:45] <%Juriasu> Reggie with the counterpick Kappa
[2:50:46] <stormhawk9891> DRIP POT
[2:50:48] <+Superbro64> Octo with the win pose having Superintendent Chalmer there is actually dumb insane
[2:50:50] <WeepyDevil> STEAMED HAMS
[2:50:50] <+breakersnap> OOOOH YEAAAAAH
[2:50:51] <SpookyBeef7> Everytime Octo streams he seems to have added five new shitpost mods. LUL
[2:50:52] <+Superbro64> that is so funny
[2:50:52] <+Mrbaconator> octo has a mod that replaced sols noises with all monkey noises
[2:50:53] <Enajy314> limesLUL
[2:50:53] <Prevot> wait what
[2:50:54] <OkamiDude15> give reggie his thick milia Kappa
[2:50:59] <morow1ec> Install the sol monkey noises mod
[2:51:16] <%jolene_orenji> IIRC there's a mod to get the ps4/5 exclusive colors on PC but I'd be afraid to get banned or something
[2:51:19] <+hexagonofdeath> oh god the fat screen tearing is back
[2:51:21] <%jinking79> Sol with the Pepsi Man mod
[2:51:24] <Thunderhog> oh AND the reboot? this is godlike
[2:51:24] <%Juriasu> the Misato Millia color is 11/10
[2:51:30] <@Solidus_113> I love the Holy Order Sol colour mod
[2:51:34] <WeepyDevil> @jolene_orenji you arne't getting banend for texture mdos lol
[2:51:46] <Equirah> If you want mods to keep being a thing don't force them to be visible on op's side. just replace slots
[2:52:05] <Cymen90> I cannot believe you killed yourself.
[2:52:10] <Cymen90> I cannot believe it
[2:52:18] <%jolene_orenji> @WeepyDevil nah I meant like the skins are in the game on the PC version and there's mods to straight up unlock them, not replace textures. Same with the DLC skins IIRC
[2:52:27] <%Juriasu> Reggie tried the cross up s disc ooh
[2:52:28] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Strider Chipp is the best mod
[2:52:29] <DedlokPM> Octo once had mods that played gangsta's paradise when he did a heavenly potemkin buster, replaced the background shown during it, and then played a reverbed fart when he landed
[2:52:33] <Equirah> @jolene_orenji no need to be, you just switch the slots of the colours. plus as long as you keep it player side you're fine
[2:52:49] <LorcaNomad> Favorite mod so far is pogtemkin
[2:52:54] <enddword> ktkSW ktkSW ktkSW
[2:53:02] <%jolene_orenji> @Equirah yeah, that's true, I'm just saying it's out there cuz woolie talked about mods that weren't client side
[2:53:03] <+JustToWatch> I really hope the 1st DLC is Goldlewis
[2:53:11] <DedlokPM> he also had a mod that played the yu-gi-oh life points sound when after he did a regular pot buster
[2:53:13] <%Juriasu> Millia has to pray to break the wall with bad moon lol
[2:53:36] <Hericknhx> either Goldlewis or Happy Chaos, but Goldweis has way more chances
[2:53:38] <%jolene_orenji> @LorcaNomad I got the gangsta's paradise and pogtemkin HPB mods, they're amazing
[2:54:06] <Equirah> @jolene_orenji non-client side mods push arcsys to take actions and are forwned upon in the modding community
[2:54:07] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:54:09] <LorcaNomad> @LorcaNomad I have yet to see it ingame but I have the same setup lol
[2:54:58] <%jolene_orenji> @Equirah yeah hopefully they don't become a problem or anything
[2:55:28] <weasnot> Phew
[2:55:46] <LorcaNomad> Looks like reggie has gotten better at millia
[2:56:08] <%Juriasu> Millia bullies Nago hard
[2:56:11] <morow1ec> Reggie just flexing at this point
[2:57:03] <%VoltageXXII> I hate playing against Millia. When they move to online matches if I get one I hope it's against Woolie
[2:57:13] <+timtomkitkat> Minus minus minus
[2:57:24] <+fetrigon> pffft jesus Reggie
[2:57:28] <%jolene_orenji> it's -7 on block
[2:57:33] <%Juriasu> yeah if you notice millia go for double jumping overhead you can usually get a button in inbetween like jab or 6P
[2:57:37] <Hericknhx> everytime Nagos loses "OMIGOTO woolieSPICE "
[2:57:55] <+hexagonofdeath> I feel the pain
[2:58:56] <%jolene_orenji> every millia main I play online is either super predictable or like playing on crack 4 way mixup every interaction and there's no in between
[2:59:07] <%VoltageXXII> ^^ this
[2:59:24] <%Deft_Thought> Same deal for Chipp players
[2:59:36] <NotHereToStream> nice hitconfirm
[2:59:48] <%Irridium> chipp and millia are definitely my hardest match-ups
[3:00:10] <Hericknhx> yeah, I played Pot and every Millia I fought I either two touched her or I coulnd't move KEKW
[3:00:31] <+a_meat_man> I always use burst in the first 5 seconds against Millia, I'm just so scared of her pressure doodDerp
[3:00:38] <+samuraiskitz> @WoolieVersus You're plus after beyblade arent ya?
[3:00:50] <NotHereToStream> nah, beyblade is 0
[3:01:00] <+hexagonofdeath> beyblade fuck
[3:01:16] <+samuraiskitz> tru
[3:01:16] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:01:26] <BackwardCap> Its good to burst early vs charcters like Millia who can convert off anything from anywhere into a wall break.
[3:01:57] <BackwardCap> They also have to hit you a lot to win, which refills burst gauge
[3:01:57] <%Grimlockfly> it's wild that she's got triple jumps and an attack that's another jump AND a dolphin
[3:02:01] <+UberWolfman> HOME RUN

[3:02:05] <+hexagonofdeath> nice
[3:02:08] <%Deft_Thought> Millia looks so damn good in this game
[3:02:09] <%keiji_maede> lol
[3:02:17] <%Mrthefro> Woolie's face after winning reminds of that podcast story of that fighting game champ who felt nothing after winning but every loss was hell.
[3:02:17] <Cymen90> Punish me Kreygasm
[3:02:24] <NotHereToStream> whiff a slash or hard slash? millia will just rush in for the punish
[3:02:30] <+kumaprime> is that the Woolie exclusive color?
[3:02:30] <+hexagonofdeath> I think she only has 2 jumps? chipp ahs 3
[3:02:40] <%Deft_Thought> Just DO IT knxHYPERJADA
[3:02:40] <%Irridium> Millia has two dashes
[3:02:49] <+hexagonofdeath> ^^
[3:02:51] <Jetsfantasy> The mod is available to anyone on PC on GameBanana
[3:02:58] <%blaccbird914> blaccbird914 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 32 months! 
[3:03:01] <Demoli_PT> millia has 2 dashes and a rose special that might as well be a third jump
[3:03:04] <%jolene_orenji> @NotHereToStream it's the playing-a-top-player option select. if they win? yeah, you're better than me, you're supposed to, duh. if they lose? hoo boy
[3:03:09] <%Deft_Thought> That damage is serious
[3:03:10] <%d1stantutopia> Just tuned in, that's a fucking sick mod
[3:03:13] <%Juriasu> she has two dasher or one jump plus one dash yeah
[3:03:30] <NotHereToStream> @jolene_orenji wrong @ ?
[3:03:36] <Applecannon63> Nago just needs some EX moves maybe act like his Blood sucking universe to burn off his blood meter
[3:03:50] <%Josef_Stryker> Just landed my first Kara Potemkin Buster online :D
[3:04:12] <%concretenj> "it doesn't matter" as woolie takes off 80% of millia's health

[3:04:27] <Applecannon63> Hell Nago could've had a blood related jump
[3:04:29] <Hericknhx> welcome to the Pot army
[3:04:38] <%Deft_Thought> Will playing with a mod like the Woolie Nago skin trigger any anti-cheat stuff?
[3:04:46] <%concretenj> no
[3:04:48] <%Josef_Stryker> Is the screen tearing or is it just me?
[3:04:55] <%Juriasu> go for command grab more imo, Reggie can't read all of them Kappa
[3:04:58] <BackwardCap> So glad I learned that her hair disc after throw isnt real.
[3:05:00] <%jolene_orenji> @Deft_Thought nah, unity has a built in modding tool and all the mods are client side
[3:05:07] <+a_meat_man> @deft_thought I have a few mods, nothing has come up from it
[3:05:09] <%Deft_Thought> @Deft_Thought Oh dope! Thanks.
[3:05:21] <%Deft_Thought> I appreciate the answers, y'all
[3:05:57] <%Juriasu> how far lust shaker has fallen
[3:06:04] <Applecannon63> Nago really needs more Blood burning moves than Blood Sucking Universe
[3:06:08] <+megaman_sentinel> dat damage is insane
[3:06:18] <%Deft_Thought> I got Strive on launch for PC but only touched it for the first time last week

[3:07:18] <%Grimlockfly> it so weird when the command grabs don't land, but it looks like it should
[3:07:22] <%jinking79> hope your hours r good
[3:07:31] <%jolene_orenji> @Deft_Thought maybe pick up millia? I feel like they're kinda similar
[3:07:31] <%Deft_Thought> I'm interested in Zato for the first time since playing XX.
[3:07:33] <BackwardCap> Why would you press NotLikeThis
[3:07:51] <%Deft_Thought> @Deft_Thought I played Millia back in +R and loved her but gravitated away in Xrd
[3:08:01] <%Deft_Thought> Mostly played Venom/I-No/Slayer
[3:08:22] <%jolene_orenji> I dunno anything about the previous games, strive is my first
[3:08:22] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:08:32] <%Deft_Thought> @jolene_orenji How you liking it?
[3:08:38] <Applecannon63> If Ex moves can't happen then why not give Nago a confirm move for his Blood sucking universe like Pot's Garuda Impact
[3:08:55] <Applecannon63> -for his Buster
[3:08:56] <%concretenj> Nago has his super to remove blood
[3:09:04] <Hericknhx> wow
[3:09:05] <%Juriasu> good old BRC nothing beats that
[3:09:07] <%concretenj> otherwise he's honestly fine, he's closer to top than bottom tier
[3:09:27] <NotHereToStream> counter 6K for nago can be cancelled into his command grab since your opponent will be staggered, but you need to react to the stagger
[3:09:31] <+Maxthetics> Yo are those modded colors
[3:09:56] <%d1stantutopia> !MOTIVATED
[3:09:56] <@Moobot> @d1stantutopia 2263 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[3:10:29] <+samuraiskitz> Woolies face looks like hes about to beat the shit outta someone LUL LUL
[3:10:57] <Hericknhx> it's a hard life for Nagos FeelsBadMan
[3:11:03] <Applecannon63> you hate to see that
[3:11:10] <%jolene_orenji> @Deft_Thought picked potemkin cuz he looked fun and never looked back. landing a pot buster in a match feels better than drugs
[3:11:11] <%d1stantutopia> Nah, Woolie's left his rough days of arcade beatdowns in the past
[3:11:12] <Hericknhx> but a rewarding one
[3:11:14] <%VoltageXXII> @samuraiskitz The contrast between him and Reggie really shows how it feels to play against Millia
[3:11:32] <+samuraiskitz> @d1stantutopia LUL LUL
[3:11:42] <%Deft_Thought> @Deft_Thought Pot Buster is straight dopamine

[3:13:17] <Dragon_Batman> I've seen a few time where Nago can use the low spin to cancel into command grab to decent success
[3:13:23] <Dragon_Batman> few times*
[3:13:28] <%Deft_Thought> Niiiice
[3:13:39] <%Juriasu> Reggie saving his burst for the next match Kappa
[3:13:42] <%jolene_orenji> it's possible to bait burst on dust follow ups as potemkin and still get a really heavy damage combo off it's insane
[3:13:42] <%jinking79> damn and he had burst
[3:13:43] <+R0kushi> reggie could have bursted at that dust though
[3:13:46] <%d1stantutopia> you lads ready for the all-American hero GOLDLEWIS DICKINSON in like 2 days
[3:14:02] <%Deft_Thought> Zato seems like a nightmare to learn in this game but I'm interested in using him for the first time
[3:14:21] <+a_meat_man> @d1stantutopia unless he's the worst, new main
[3:14:30] <%jolene_orenji> @Deft_Thought the plus side is that no one has MU knowledge naroSmug
[3:14:40] <+samuraiskitz> Even in Pro-play, you can tell the players are desperate af for a gold burst. They'll even forget they had it
[3:14:46] <%Deft_Thought> @Deft_Thought LUL
[3:14:55] <%d1stantutopia> I'll mess about with him but I'm waiting for the glorious return of my girl Jack-O
[3:15:05] <+CANDIDfellow> ayyyyy. see u you rocking the Woolie mod on nago
[3:15:17] <+3d_pbandj> Woolie is getting mentally guard broken in these fights
[3:15:23] <%eotani> eotani subscribed at Tier 1. 
[3:15:50] <%Juriasu> playing your bad matchups in this game is the worst but you gotta learn
[3:15:50] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1414834352052215808?s=19
[3:15:54] <CzeekyTV> I'm constantly impressed by the animation in this game
[3:16:06] <Applecannon63> All I expect from Jack O's return is she plays like Justice but with a bullet hell shooters gimmick
[3:16:13] <Cymen90> I cannot believe you killed yourself.
[3:16:17] <Cymen90> I cannot believe it
[3:16:25] <kingofjibs> I mean yea but then there's Sol normal throw
[3:16:27] <%VoltageXXII> Congratulations. You played yourself.
[3:16:39] <%jolene_orenji> @Cymen90 someone needs to make a mod that plays that when nago blood bursts
[3:16:44] <Hericknhx> "We trained him wrong, as a joke" -Slayer
[3:16:46] <%d1stantutopia> @CzeekyTV I absolutely adored her play in Xrd, I hope it's like that
[3:16:49] <Applecannon63> like give Jack O have bullet upgrades and bombs
[3:17:08] <+ManOfReason> oneeHappy well played reggie oneeHappy
[3:17:09] <Applecannon63> basically a tolerable Elphet
[3:17:11] <ElPlasa> ya hate to see that
[3:17:20] <kingofjibs> Wouldn't it make more sense if JackO played like judgement?
[3:17:27] <Cymen90> Milia dancing on your corpse like SourPls
[3:17:33] <%Deft_Thought> If that was Sol f.S, that Nago super woulda hit
[3:17:53] <Applecannon63> Jack O with beatem up mechanics?
[3:17:55] <%Juriasu> combo into blood pop PogChamp
[3:17:57] <RyuuAoi> I MADE IT
[3:17:59] <Hericknhx> @WoolieVersus do you have any other characters you wanna play right now or Nago is the way
[3:18:04] <Dragon_Batman> At least it looked dope lol
[3:18:15] <NotHereToStream> worst feeling in the world, nago scores a HS counter but your blood gauge is on the verge of popping FeelsBadMan
[3:18:28] <%d1stantutopia> @Applecannon63 she hits you with a trash can that she can then destroy to eat a full roast chicken and regain 10hp
[3:18:34] <+Jack8274> Those footsies
[3:18:58] <%Juriasu> what a move Reggie
[3:19:10] <%Deft_Thought> Reggie with them next level mind games
[3:19:16] <+timtomkitkat> Lol reggie
[3:19:21] <Applecannon63> basically Jack O would be more Metal Slug
[3:19:28] <Daniel_Is_I> There are so many times where I realize if I'd wallbroken with a super I'd have killed them, and then I panic and die
[3:19:32] <Applecannon63> so side scroller shooter
[3:19:32] <Daniel_Is_I> It feels awful
[3:19:53] <+R0kushi> if I have the bar and put the oponent on the wall, I'll just super because it feels good
[3:19:55] <%VoltageXXII> Reggie burst man
[3:19:56] <Hericknhx> I wonder who is goint the be the first veteran DLC
[3:20:01] <Demoli_PT> you had burst garfield!
[3:20:20] <+ManOfReason> the pre jump frames are killer
[3:20:21] <Brandon__Brando> chicken block?
[3:20:23] <+ArmoredAnathema> What's the matter? Not chicken enough?
[3:20:26] <NotHereToStream> hope fuzzy guard is in your favour
[3:20:28] <he1lhydra> nago especially has a shit ton of pre-jump frames
[3:20:29] <%Irridium> I also get smacked every single time I try to jump and block
[3:20:30] <%jolene_orenji> nah chat just wait reggie's gonna get all these bursts back next round and is gonna have like 6 in a row cuz he saved them
[3:20:41] <ElPlasa> LUL
[3:20:47] <Daniel_Is_I> @Brandon__Brando "Holding up-back while you are being attacked so that you jump as soon as there is any gap in your opponent's sequence."
[3:21:05] <+a_meat_man> @jolene_orenji gonna put those bursts in a savings account
[3:21:12] <NotHereToStream> I thought chicken block is aerial blocking to avoid grounds high or low mixups
[3:21:18] <watchdv> Chicken blocks are trash in strive i thinks it’s something with the jumps startup frames
[3:21:19] <Brandon__Brando> @daniel_is_i oh shit never thought of doing that
[3:21:20] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[3:21:24] <%VoltageXXII> Even when he finally learns that he can't take those sticks of butter with him finds a new resource to horde.
[3:21:24] <+Jack8274> Nope lol
[3:21:25] <%TimetodiveLTX> *shurug*
[3:21:25] <Hericknhx> is that too @NotHereToStream
[3:21:30] <NotHereToStream> ah ok
[3:21:36] <+Jack8274> Reggie steps inside, why hello there
[3:21:46] <+ManOfReason> chicken blocking also cranks your risc alot
[3:21:50] <Hericknhx> it's more of a mahvel thing tho
[3:21:51] <he1lhydra> also, blocking in the air in this game forces 19 more blockstun frames so you're extra stuck
[3:22:05] <+Jack8274> These footsies are sexy
[3:22:11] <Daniel_Is_I> Yeah I think everyone has a 4f prejump period
[3:22:16] <+Axellogic> Suicide mastery
[3:22:17] <+ManOfReason> oneeHappy ggs oneeHappy
[3:22:18] <weasnot> Guilty Gears
[3:22:18] <%VoltageXXII> Let's go
[3:22:21] <RyuuAoi> @woolieversus Give us something from the barrel after GGS tonight! Please! Encore! Third Strike?
[3:22:25] <@Solidus_113> !uptime
[3:22:25] <@Moobot> @Solidus_113 WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 45 minutes
[3:22:26] <DeadManProp> Hello, people of the world
[3:22:34] <b_ikki> his smile and optimism gone
[3:22:34] <SyeAtTwitch> hey
[3:22:45] <WickedTwizzler> that custom nago color is great FeelsAmazingMan
[3:22:46] <NotHereToStream> if you are willing to spend meter, you can get a good command grab with nago
[3:23:02] <Brandon__Brando> that blood system tho
[3:23:02] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:23:24] <%Juriasu> I think nago just has to cancel his unsafe stuff with the dash or maybe the beyblade if you have a read
[3:23:28] <%jolene_orenji> communicating with server...
[3:23:45] <%Deft_Thought> Let's go beat the first boss of DS1 while the game connects to the server 4Head
[3:23:50] <%Noonoox12> yooo nago research time
[3:23:53] <NotHereToStream> the issue with nago is if he whiffs the big buttons, thats just easy whiff
[3:24:00] <watchdv> Peep fame96’s nago @woolieversus
[3:24:20] <%Juriasu> yeah that's the combo
[3:24:30] <NotHereToStream> huh, 5k is a good anti millia dash approach
[3:24:34] <+ManOfReason> nago really needs a good round start
[3:24:45] <+Jack8274> The pressure!
[3:24:47] <bigshedman> Shit, I'm totally rewatching this vod for these combos
[3:24:58] <ElPlasa> Wave check
[3:25:03] <Dragon_Batman> I think another thing is having good super placement
[3:25:12] <%Juriasu> yeah Reggie plays grounded
[3:25:12] <%jolene_orenji> "millias that jump a lot" soooo every millia?
[3:25:18] <Applecannon63> yo whats this theme?
[3:25:36] <Daniel_Is_I> Be one with the bushido
[3:25:44] <NotHereToStream> matchup is to swat the fly
[3:25:49] <%Sparkseid> millia do be schmovin
[3:26:05] <he1lhydra> as kizzie put it yesterday, alot of nago's neutral is flipping a coin when you're swinging like axl does
[3:26:11] <%jinking79> i hate getting hit by the Mask on into super
[3:26:49] <%Juriasu> yeah dash in grab is one of Nago's scariest things to me
[3:26:52] <%VoltageXXII> @he1lhydra At least Nago has crazy damage when he doeshit.
[3:26:59] <Dragon_Batman> That Millia was not a good example lol
[3:27:09] <NotHereToStream> noticing nago is doing alot of checks to stop millia's approach
[3:27:29] <Applecannon63> Isn't Nago's Blood Super instantly put his mask back?
[3:27:42] <%VoltageXXII> Yeah
[3:27:43] <Dragon_Batman> But there is still alot of recovery
[3:27:43] <WeijiBeng> and then they send you to the wrong gameplay bdeoPoggers
[3:27:46] <Daniel_Is_I> Yeah but if you whiff the super it's a big recovery
[3:27:49] <+nial_evol> is it fame shit or not fame shit
[3:27:52] <ElPlasa> @Applecannon63 Yeah, but it's really unsafe even on block
[3:28:02] <bigshedman> @Applecannon63 Yes but it's super unsafe on block and also if you get hit during the super, you don't put the mask back on and just waste the meter.
[3:28:19] <%Juriasu> he doesn't because Millia can't do much vs pressure like that
[3:28:41] <%jinking79> only Arcade Nago can RC the blood super
[3:28:53] <NotHereToStream> a yolo nago can be scary
[3:28:55] <Daniel_Is_I> When I go against Nago as Gio, the toughest Nagos are the ones that go hyperaggressive, but they're reliant on landing bites
[3:28:55] <%Juriasu> SourPls
[3:29:01] <%Wool> Millia could have super and killed smh
[3:29:04] <Dragon_Batman> Should have supered for wall break yea
[3:29:08] <Demoli_PT> he fucked up the super input
[3:29:26] <%jolene_orenji> @Demoliboy2 that's a mood
[3:29:38] <+nial_evol> this man lets it rip
[3:30:23] <+nial_evol> nago's health and guts are a resource
[3:30:23] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:30:35] <%Juriasu> I don't think she was that tame she just doesn't get much space to move if she get's pressured like that
[3:30:38] <RyuuAoi> Train her
[3:30:39] <%jolene_orenji> "when she's tame, you can run a train on her" -woolie, 2021
[3:30:40] <Cymen90> "When she is tame, you can run a train on her" WOOLIE!!!!!
[3:30:40] <FrostedZaibatsu> what???
[3:30:41] <NotHereToStream> for me, its about conditioning people to not press buttons, then go in when they block more
[3:30:42] <+ikantreeed> u can do what now????
[3:30:43] <Dragon_Batman> Swatting Mosquito's the fight
[3:30:44] <%Josef_Stryker> Nagoriyuki vs Potemkin is a fun matchup imo. Because both will just blow up the other's health and both need to be super careful
[3:30:55] <%Juriasu> Millia is bottom 3Kappa
[3:30:55] <WeijiBeng> gotta call the animal control onn her
[3:30:57] <%jolene_orenji> at least nago didn't job in the story
[3:31:02] <%TimetodiveLTX> woolie curse
[3:31:04] <+CANDIDfellow> I believe wall splat eats y last input, so if you can react far enough you can cancel with her roll to leave you right in from of them.
[3:31:09] <%concretenj> Nago is definitely one of the hardest characters to play despite his combos being easy lol
[3:31:11] <Ramasama13> except vergil in marvel 3
[3:31:21] <+Superbro64> At least the netcode is good. Remember Samsho @woolieversus
[3:31:27] <Brandon__Brando> time to join pot
[3:31:30] <+generalve> why oceana and not NA ?
[3:31:32] <Thunderhog> I believe there is some math to wall splat. Hard to explain in a single sentence, but roughly around 10 heavy hits tend to trigger a wallsplat
[3:31:33] <+Superbro64> *shudders*
[3:31:46] <Cymen90> When fighting game lingo goes too far "When she is tame, you can run a train on her". This is the thuggery we were warned about
[3:31:47] <squiffy_jet> man why you gotta bring up virgil?
[3:31:47] <%Josef_Stryker> @generalve It doesn't really matter where thanks to rollback
[3:31:52] <+generalve> LUL
[3:31:57] <+yeknomlive> is this their first time in the park today?
[3:32:03] <+ikantreeed> if i get ordered that commission tday, im buying the game
[3:32:03] <%Josef_Stryker> Yeah
[3:32:06] <%TimetodiveLTX> nice line
[3:32:15] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[3:32:17] <squiffy_jet> yo it'll never happen but Dante & Virgil would be tight guest characters for Strive
[3:32:24] <WeijiBeng> Woolie : Oh I like this character. Character : Slow startup long ass normals bdeoOk
[3:32:25] <+Superbro64> EYY. A Leo! Gotta take notes
[3:32:27] <FrostedZaibatsu> The blond person was first but okay...
[3:32:42] <+horsesaredumb> anyone here know if Strive online is good in middle east?
[3:32:46] <primaryfire> that purple is looking kinda nice on him
[3:33:01] <RyuuAoi> Woof
[3:33:02] <+Superbro64> Leo flashkick is super usefule for contesting Gio and Anji plus moves, yup yup
[3:33:08] <%Deft_Thought> Is Woolie playing on PC?
[3:33:18] <%jinking79> i have to cheer for Leo
[3:33:20] <+horsesaredumb> @Deft_Thought yes
[3:33:20] <WeijiBeng> they made leo chill but players still go crazy with him
[3:33:22] <FrostedZaibatsu> @horsesaredumb its rollback
[3:33:28] <%Deft_Thought> @Deft_Thought Word, thank you
[3:33:58] <%Noonoox12> @Deft_Thought oceania park 4
[3:33:58] <ElPlasa> 6P
[3:34:03] <Applecannon63> If only Nago could've had Slayer's Dandy Step gimmick with his Fukyō like were he uses it can follow up his command normals or his Shizureyuki
[3:34:05] <+horsesaredumb> @horsesaredumb rollback will work well even if I match to EU or SE Asia?
[3:34:06] <Hericknhx> HELLFIRE HELLFIRE catJAM

[3:34:38] <%jolene_orenji> @horsesaredumb matches aren't gonna be perfect, but a bad GGST match is a heck of a lot better than any other game I've played
[3:34:42] <RyuuAoi> TAKE IT
[3:34:46] <Heefnoff> Good game
[3:34:50] <+R0kushi> you cant stop the blood hunger
[3:34:56] <%Noonoox12> @jolene_orenji word
[3:35:01] <+ikantreeed> aren't we all idiots woolie?
[3:35:04] <+Superbro64> JP single elims I see? Guy had good manners passing it to the next player

[3:35:15] <%jinking79> let's go Leo
[3:35:18] <Hericknhx> btw when is Elphlet Pog emote Kappa @WoolieVersus
[3:35:20] <RyuuAoi> @ikantreeed Here here
[3:35:22] <+Superbro64> 2 rounds is not *nearly* enough time to adapt to playstyles though, at least for me
[3:35:23] <+horsesaredumb> @horsesaredumb thank you <3 I'll probably buy it this week then :)
[3:35:28] <Heefnoff> @superbro64 Hey thanks I appreciate that
[3:35:32] <+R0kushi> this match is pain
[3:35:36] <Heefnoff> And yeah Leo is stupid good in a format like this because of that
[3:35:43] <+Superbro64> going through that line of players with only 2 rounds to about sounds like a nightmare
[3:36:00] <Hericknhx> you should Play Pot if you think this MU is bad FeelsBadMan
[3:36:01] <Daniel_Is_I> fast RC
[3:36:04] <+Superbro64> @heefnoff Ya dude, super clean Leo, much much better than mine. You deserve that VIP fo sure
[3:36:04] <Heefnoff> Definitely stressful lol, no time to adapt
[3:36:14] <RyuuAoi> You got this next round, Woolie!
[3:36:21] <%jolene_orenji> I feel like pot and nago share a lot of characteristics and Axl is one of pot's worst matchups so I can imagine it's bad for nago too
[3:36:23] <%jinking79> we gonna get time stop Taunt/Respect
[3:36:27] <RyuuAoi> Can't stop the bum rush!
[3:36:28] <Heefnoff> Hey thanks I appreciate it! @superbro64 I’ll keep working on him
[3:36:28] <weasnot> SingsNote
[3:36:36] <+Superbro64> @heefnoff doodBro
[3:36:38] <+Mrbaconator> @Heefnoff yo wanna play some later after this? i been trying to spam leo
[3:36:45] <+ikantreeed> sexy
[3:36:50] <Heefnoff> Sure, you waiting in line rn? @mrbaconator
[3:36:51] <RyuuAoi> Smooth
[3:36:54] <+Mrbaconator> ye im in line
[3:37:06] <SpookyBeef7> Yeah, if you can get in on Axl he's mostly done for. Getting in is the actual hard part, though.
[3:37:06] <%VoltageXXII> Oh no. He's a better Axl than me. I'm definitely gonna lose when I get a match
[3:37:09] <Heefnoff> How far in? Close to the front? @mrbaconator
[3:37:11] <bookchin> I know they are supposed to be re-purpoused farm-tools, but two chained together sickles just seem impractical for literally every task.
[3:37:15] <+Mrbaconator> 9 to 10 in front of me
[3:37:17] <+Mrbaconator> it seems
[3:37:33] <Heefnoff> Ok no worries, I’ll just do Celestial matches in the meantime. Ping me when you’re done yeah? @mrbaconator
[3:37:33] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:37:38] <+Mrbaconator> sure
[3:37:40] <+Superbro64> @jolene_orenji I have yet to learn the Axl matchup, goddam nightmare
[3:37:43] <+Mrbaconator> are you on the CSB discord?
[3:37:45] <Hericknhx> Damn Octo won POGGERS
[3:37:53] <bigshedman> @VoltageXXII Pay attention to what this Axl is doing wrong, and never give up. I believe you can do it!
[3:37:58] <Heefnoff> Ah no actually @mrbaconator is there a link for that?
[3:37:59] <+Superbro64> Smart Axl's will not let you get in at all
[3:37:59] <Applecannon63> Maybe the Strive updated game,Nago should get a EX Fukyō with additional Rekka moves
[3:38:07] <%jolene_orenji> @Superbro64 I have nightmares about playing axl and ram as pot, it's just no fun naroScared
[3:38:08] <+Mrbaconator> ye one sec ill go ask where it is
[3:38:16] <%TimetodiveLTX> second gig
[3:38:22] <RyuuAoi> Best two outta three!
[3:38:22] <Heefnoff> Ok just DM it to me on here @mrbaconator
[3:38:25] <Daniel_Is_I> Yeah getting in on a good Axl is an uphill battle
[3:38:26] <+Mrbaconator> you got it
[3:38:30] <@Solidus_113> it's on the subreddit
[3:38:34] <+ikantreeed> Nago seems like one of the thoughest character in the game no?
[3:38:48] <NotHereToStream> tough to use yes
[3:38:54] <+nial_evol> he has a ton of hp and defense if you meant that
[3:38:59] <%jolene_orenji> @ikantreeed to learn? I feel like he's probably somewhere in the middle but closer to hardest
[3:39:02] <+Superbro64> @jolene_orenji 2 touch to death ram is definitely tough, but not many talk about how oppressive her jump slashes are
[3:39:03] <Applecannon63> tough to master with risk rewards
[3:39:05] <Hericknhx> Nago is def a wierdo when it comes to get used to him
[3:39:06] <+ikantreeed> i meant to use yea
[3:39:11] <%jinking79> all correct
[3:39:16] <+R0kushi> he is not hard to learn, but def hard to master
[3:39:18] <%VoltageXXII> @bigshedman SeemsGood thanks man!
[3:39:27] <%jolene_orenji> @Superbro64 her jump slashes and also her projectiles in the corner
[3:39:35] <%TimetodiveLTX> oh wow nice punish
[3:39:38] <%TimetodiveLTX> on the super
[3:39:39] <+Superbro64> ram gets toothless with no swords, which is much less an issue then axl, who falls apart I find to Leo pressue in close range
[3:39:40] <+R0kushi> like you can do pretty well with his bnbs
[3:39:41] <Hericknhx> lariato POGGERS
[3:39:46] <%TimetodiveLTX> i didn't know you could do that
[3:39:52] <%VoltageXXII> The dirty command grab. You love to see it
[3:39:55] <Applecannon63> It doesn't help he doesn't have a regular dash and only a command dash
[3:39:58] <RyuuAoi> GAMER
[3:40:02] <%Irridium> gg's man
[3:40:03] <%jolene_orenji> WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT WOOLIE
[3:40:06] <+timtomkitkat> @jolene_orenji You can flick the sword explosion back to ram
[3:40:07] <Equirah> Oh no LUL
[3:40:09] <%jolene_orenji> I DON'T WANNA HEAR YOU DISRESPECTIN POT IN THIS HOUSEHOLD
[3:40:10] <%SirGO0SE> Wish I was home so I could play with you boys, hope you're doing well
[3:40:10] <NotHereToStream> because pot is slower

[3:40:40] <FabulouzMaskedKnight> @timtomkitkat Only the explosion, the sockwave after "eats" the flick
[3:40:40] <+Mrbaconator> jesus that level on chipp

[3:49:07] <%Josef_Stryker> DISCORD PRESIDES IN SOCIETY
[3:49:31] <%VoltageXXII> @Irridium Any Anti-Woolie tips to a fellow Axl? xD
[3:49:38] <weasnot> In Slave's Glory
[3:49:50] <Hericknhx> Cali Burst KEKW
[3:49:50] <weasnot> Got the jail outfit
[3:50:00] <Equirah> ani anti-wollie tips for a bad Pot? LUL
[3:50:31] <Daniel_Is_I> There's the MEGAFISTO
[3:50:37] <%Irridium> @VoltageXXII he's always gonna expect the lariet so you gotta be sneaky with it. After slash slash he'll either try to bite or teleport, both are punishable with down kick into down dust
[3:50:40] <%Noonoox12> @Equirah check out Octopimp's streams / vids? He put out a good short tutorial recently
[3:50:46] <Hericknhx> POGGERS
[3:50:50] <%Mrthefro> Dab on em
[3:51:03] <%VoltageXXII> @Irridium Thanks man!
[3:51:14] <+Superbro64> woolie is probably playing safer on purpose, seeing all the people he has to go through, maybe try wildcarding and see what happens? @equirah
[3:51:25] <+Superbro64> not many people can see through a gg scramble
[3:51:29] <%Irridium> @VoltageXXII He's gonna try to jump in and attack, so keep your 6K ready to smack him. If you get a counter you can combo into punch and side kick again. Good luck!
[3:51:35] <Hericknhx> damn
[3:51:35] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:51:40] <Hericknhx> yeah
[3:51:44] <%Irridium> @VoltageXXII apart form that just gotta watch and get a feel for how he plays
[3:51:59] <%VoltageXXII> Cool. That's hopefully gonna help
[3:52:03] <Hericknhx> Pot Buster is harder to when you in nervous

[3:53:30] <Bonebagmel> @Brandon__Brando I play on keyboard, it popped on my right hand (action buttons). Still trying to figure out a good solution.
[3:53:34] <%Josef_Stryker> Nago's theme is so good woolieGASM
[3:53:44] <+Superbro64> @mrbaconator PogChamp
[3:53:55] <Applecannon63> Sounds like Universal Will or Midnight Carnival?
[3:53:55] <%Irridium> PogChamp
[3:53:56] <%Sparkseid> oof bad luck
[3:54:00] <Hericknhx> this is not the Nago theme but still good KEKW
[3:54:07] <Applecannon63> huh?
[3:54:12] <%Josef_Stryker> Oh I didn't realize this was modded in music
[3:54:17] <Heefnoff> @mrbaconator You get used to it lol
[3:54:22] <%Josef_Stryker> But my point still stands that Nago's theme slaps
[3:54:23] <+Superbro64> good work
[3:54:24] <Hericknhx> @Josef_Stryker this is the older track KEKW
[3:54:25] <%jinking79> damn ppl be having better luck than me fishing for these songs
[3:54:27] <Daniel_Is_I> I love it when people do the same thing in a mirror. Perfectly symmetrical violence.
[3:54:28] <Bonebagmel> Not modded Woolie skin yet?
[3:54:33] <+Mrbaconator> oh i fight floor 10 people all the time just to learn from getting my ass beat @Heefnoff

[3:55:23] <+Solid_Stro> sabert14Box
[3:55:27] <%Josef_Stryker> How do you get the VIP player tag? Do u need to get to Heaven or just be a really high level?
[3:55:30] <Bonebagmel> Oh, on screen buttons threw me off
[3:55:30] <+Superbro64> anji's rekkas are all lies if you got an invincible reversal. Not sure if Nago has one
[3:55:31] <+Mrbaconator> anjis parry is nutty
[3:55:34] <Applecannon63> I mean Nago has a Onigiri diet
[3:55:36] <%jolene_orenji> @Josef_Stryker it's for getting into heaven
[3:55:37] <Bonebagmel> squinting time bois let's go
[3:55:45] <CupsCommander> I'm a little miffed I don't have Midnight Carnival unlocked yet :(
[3:55:51] <Hericknhx> @Josef_Stryker you need to get to heaven then win 5 matches
[3:55:52] <NotHereToStream> fuujin's followup can be challenged
[3:56:46] <Applecannon63> Fuujin follow ups are kinda boring
[3:57:03] <%Irridium> god I haven't fought an Anji in so long I just realized
[3:57:04] <Daniel_Is_I> I didn't know you could tech the throw off a counter
[3:57:12] <%d1stantutopia> I got Wanna Be Crazy the other day and, to quote DIO, I've seen enough. I'm satisfied.
[3:57:19] <Equirah> rip me
[3:57:23] <Applecannon63> maybe Nagiha is good but thats pretty much it with fuujin
[3:57:37] <ElPlasa> @d1stantutopia I'm still fishing for dice
[3:57:37] <overkrustice> where my mays at
[3:57:45] <+Superbro64> huh, didnt know that they update the news section
[3:57:56] <+Superbro64> just noticed that the 500k sales announcement is there
[3:57:57] <+NukeDaHippies> What i hate about fishing is when you just want the game on random you've gotna billion songs you don't about in the mix
[3:57:59] <+Mrbaconator> @overkrustice i play leo and may
[3:58:05] <+Mrbaconator> gonna leo for this tho
[3:58:13] <+yeknomlive> gio and sol are rough with their delays
[3:58:18] <+KennyKRool> There's also a super option select as nagoriyuki
[3:58:25] <he1lhydra> stagger pressure is the smell of the game
[3:58:35] <%Josef_Stryker> No Sol players yet?
[3:58:35] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:58:36] <+Superbro64> @nukedahippies game needs a random select song blacklist, I agree
[3:58:42] <Daniel_Is_I> I wanna see one of these Pots get Woolie into a garuda impact trap
[3:58:57] <Daniel_Is_I> That shit is so annoying
[3:58:58] <NotHereToStream> hammerfall can be grabbed
[3:59:01] <+yeknomlive> id like the random to random each rematch too
[3:59:25] <Equirah> gg LUL
[3:59:25] <+Superbro64> gg @equirah
[3:59:25] <Bonebagmel> no, he megafisted the router
[3:59:29] <+megaman_sentinel> what just happened
[3:59:30] <Applecannon63> fishing wouldn't be bad if they actually give you unlockable colors thats for your fighter than habbo hotel avatars…
[3:59:33] <+NukeDaHippies> yea that too....and switch between player 1 to player 2 each match. only left player has their music play
[3:59:41] <Equirah> yeah, there was a slight hitch
[3:59:46] <%Axle13j> Axle13j subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! Lesgooo
[3:59:58] <%Irridium> @Applecannon63 it'd also be nice of older games' music weren't lower in volume compared to Strive's music
[4:00:08] <CupsCommander> I know it's not quite the same, but there is a mod that makes smell of the game the random select option, and has songs that aren't in strive
[4:00:18] <%d1stantutopia> @Irridium didn't they patch that?
[4:00:28] <+Superbro64> @irridium so its not just me? I thought the extra tunes are barely audible
[4:00:29] <%Josef_Stryker> Woolie vs Better Woolie?
[4:00:30] <+Superbro64> huh
[4:00:32] <+KennyKRool> Sub only games or?
[4:00:39] <%jolene_orenji> @WoolieVersus you're not using the mod skin btw
[4:00:42] <+Superbro64> I wonder if theres a mod that fixes that
[4:00:51] <%Irridium> @d1stantutopia I don't think so? still sounded quiet today to me
[4:00:53] <+KennyKRool> !lobby
[4:00:57] <RyuuAoi> FINALLY
[4:00:59] <+Superbro64> @kennykrool if you can get in the lobby you can play woolie
[4:01:05] <+KennyKRool> Thanks Superbro64
[4:01:10] <+Superbro64> no sub necessary
[4:01:12] <Demoli_PT> purple mask in the lobby is cutting line
[4:01:17] <+NukeDaHippies> I had a feeling they were a bit lower compared to others. I thought it was my crap tv speaker
[4:01:19] <%Irridium> @KennyKRool it's Oceana park 4 btw
[4:01:30] <+KennyKRool> I found it Irridium But I wanted to know if I had to pay respect first :)
[4:01:41] <%Deft_Thought> Every time I see that health loss, it hurts my feelings
[4:01:41] <bigshedman> On PC there is a mod that fixes the Xrd music being too quiet.
[4:01:41] <RyuuAoi> LEARNING EXPERIENCE
[4:01:46] <Daniel_Is_I> Is it not worth it to spend the tension to hold your burst by FDing?
[4:01:47] <HitchhikingThrough> how
[4:01:48] <%Irridium> @KennyKRool nah none of us here are worthy of respect
[4:01:59] <%d1stantutopia> @Irridium I could be super wrong, but I remember reading something about music volume in the patch notes
[4:01:59] <HitchhikingThrough> my life consists of nothing but them
[4:02:04] <Hericknhx> if you have a move like garuda impacto, meatis are easy Kappa
[4:02:26] <%jolene_orenji> @Daniel_Is_I as a rule of thumb, using tension is always preferrable to bursting because your burst doesn't refresh each round but tension does
[4:02:48] <Daniel_Is_I> By burst I meant the blood pop
[4:02:53] <Daniel_Is_I> Sorry
[4:02:58] <Applecannon63> if they ever bring back testament it be neat if he was an assist type fighter
[4:03:02] <Bonebagmel> Anybody else see screentearing on the stream?
[4:03:04] <Hericknhx> omigoto woolieDATTEBAYO
[4:03:04] <yoush03> is Woolie playing on pad?
[4:03:16] <+Superbro64> throws are both surprisingly fast, and surprisingly shallow
[4:03:19] <NotHereToStream> using tension to hold off your blood pop ain't worth it, you're delaying the inevitable and you lose tension
[4:03:27] <%jolene_orenji> @yoush03 I think he's playing on a ps5 controller
[4:03:27] <+KennyKRool> Yo Axel mains PogChamp
[4:03:30] <RyuuAoi> SHIN Woolie
[4:03:37] <Hericknhx> @Superbro64 still not as bad as old throws

[4:06:10] <%Raios22> Raios22 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 4 month streak! 
[4:06:11] <+Superbro64> taunt cancel techs in strive is a neat thing indeed
[4:06:17] <+R0kushi> expect for the sol taunt, other taunts are so cool i cant even get mad
[4:06:18] <%Irridium> @VoltageXXII it happens man. Nago match-ups either go great or very, very poorly I find.
[4:06:23] <+R0kushi> sol flipping you off is not fun
[4:06:30] <%jolene_orenji> taunt cancelling is INSANE
[4:06:37] <%VoltageXXII> Woolie press L3 to get rid of the news section. GGs your lore videos is what convinced me to get Strive in the first place and start playing Guilty Gear. SeemsGood
[4:06:37] <+KennyKRool> Yo its Pat 2?
[4:06:38] <+KennyKRool> Pog
[4:06:39] <yukichocomilk> I play ram and always lose to millia LUL
[4:06:45] <stormhawk9891> Block
[4:06:46] <NotHereToStream> yeah, taunt prc just to remove RRC scaling is great too
[4:06:51] <Daniel_Is_I> Ram's j.H hitbox is so stupid
[4:06:51] <CarmineAcciai> Yeah, Ram always royally screws me up.
[4:06:53] <+TitanGigante> 18 floating greatswords in the corner at RAM RANCH?
[4:07:00] <@Solidus_113> round start hair car
[4:07:01] <%RealThiele> 2 pats in a trenchcoat
[4:07:19] <+Mrbaconator> millia is an angry coked up raccoon who wants to steal your money
[4:07:20] <+Superbro64> so short story: I finally got into heaven after playing the entire day, and the only other player in heaven was a level 400 ram
[4:07:21] <Hericknhx> this guy def on wife
[4:07:24] <stormhawk9891> Round start gold burst, they'll never see it coming
[4:07:26] <Demoli_PT> wow lots of delay frames on low ping
[4:07:28] <%jolene_orenji> "let's get out of the corner" surprise! you're in the other corner now!
[4:07:29] <@Solidus_113> this a wifi ram
[4:07:30] <Bonebagmel> 7 frames rollback
[4:07:31] <Demoli_PT> this is a wifi warrior
[4:07:32] <Hericknhx> 80 ping with 7 rollbacks
[4:07:32] <+Superbro64> needless to say I never got back into heaven since
[4:07:33] <%Mrthefro> Turn off the stream brother LUL
[4:07:33] <CarmineAcciai> There's some serious rollback here.
[4:07:34] <passserby> rollbakc frames going up there
[4:07:36] <HitchhikingThrough> he chilling with the 6 frames
[4:07:39] <+R0kushi> not wifi, guys pc is burning
[4:07:42] <+R0kushi> prob
[4:07:45] <Hericknhx> either that or the PC is bad
[4:07:46] <+KennyKRool> This is an Anime PC
[4:07:46] <Daniel_Is_I> Looks like an inconsistent connection
[4:07:46] <Bonebagmel> Ram's is either on wifi or potato
[4:07:49] <HitchhikingThrough> 4K ram
[4:07:50] <%Noonoox12> his PC is bullshit blazing
[4:07:50] <+KennyKRool> PC can't handle the game
[4:07:57] <TheDrown> Jumping between 3-7 rolls WutFace
[4:07:58] <RyuuAoi> Ram bam thank you, ma'am!
[4:07:58] <he1lhydra> @WoolieVersus this stage is one of the bad ones as well
[4:08:01] <Daniel_Is_I> Rollback frames keep changing
[4:08:06] <Applecannon63> Opponent's PC is a potato
[4:08:09] <%VoltageXXII> @Irridium Yeah. I'm not that great at a lot of mechanics honestly or inputs. I get by mostly on reads. It's why I play a zoner. lol
[4:08:10] <HitchhikingThrough> Ram running in 4K Max AntiAliasing
[4:08:12] <schitzie> stage lag often
[4:08:18] <%Deft_Thought> I'm on wifi, sadly, so I'm not trying to hop in and fuck up the matches
[4:08:21] <%jolene_orenji> I think this is the least bad bad stage
[4:08:21] <Applecannon63> Potato PC
[4:08:25] <+R0kushi> nah, but this stage is not that bad
[4:08:28] <@Solidus_113> I had a match a week or so ago that was literally in slow motion. it's on my twitter
[4:08:29] <Bonebagmel> Jungle has lag
[4:08:30] <+nellen55> we are allready there lol
[4:08:31] <%SveriSageAdvice> unfortunately that is the case
[4:08:32] <+Superbro64> Blazblue snow stage tech LUL
[4:08:32] <+Arnschen> Yeah, there are
[4:08:33] <Daniel_Is_I> May's stage is SUPER lag
[4:08:35] <CarmineAcciai> Yeah, Illria and Ajatar Hunting Ground (Jungle) causes lag.
[4:08:36] <%SveriSageAdvice> there are three i believe
[4:08:36] <+nellen55> there is
[4:08:37] <%townzzzzz> bring back the train stage Kappa
[4:08:37] <%bustahwuulf> Silver Feet has the least lag
[4:08:39] <+Canti510> There are
[4:08:44] <+R0kushi> grid figther V
[4:08:45] <Brandon__Brando> aslo
[4:08:45] <CarmineAcciai> Also apparently the Mayship has a lot of lag form what I hear?
[4:08:48] <+nellen55> 3 of them are like trhat
[4:08:48] <bigshedman> PogChamp SF4 vanilla volcano stage
[4:08:51] <%jolene_orenji> 7th heaven and A Happy Family don't lag which is cool cuz they're awesome stages
[4:08:51] <+KennyKRool> Reggie got the confirms
[4:08:58] <+Arnschen> I think Zato's stage is alright
[4:08:58] <+Superbro64> what strive ACTUALLY needs is a pc benchmark, KI has one before you can go online @woolieversus
[4:09:04] <Strykerdown> Apparently May's stage is really bad
[4:09:08] <+KennyKRool> Superbro64 You right
[4:09:12] <+Superbro64> SFIV PC had one too, funnily enough @woolieversus
[4:09:13] <+Checktrap> no
[4:09:14] <+nellen55> i hope they can fix it
[4:09:14] <HitchhikingThrough> Patch when
[4:09:14] <DrkJP520> what about FighterZ?
[4:09:16] <+R0kushi> zato, sol, pot and nago stages are all cool
[4:09:16] <Hericknhx> Tekken 7
[4:09:17] <+MrMediocrity> divekick all day
[4:09:19] <Hericknhx> DBFZ
[4:09:19] <ElPlasa> Tekken is pretty cclose
[4:09:20] <%jolene_orenji> @Strykerdown may's stage is the WORST
[4:09:21] <%Deft_Thought> KOF?
[4:09:23] <Brandon__Brando> as least it's not only training stage sf4 was the worst
[4:09:24] <+Pat_Squared> my bad y'all should've paused the stream while playing
[4:09:24] <%jolene_orenji> which sucks cuz it's my FAVORITE
[4:09:25] <Hericknhx> yeah KOF
[4:09:35] <Hericknhx> GGXrd Rev 2 was ok
[4:09:41] <Hericknhx> with the stages
[4:09:46] <+Superbro64> KI has a pc benchmark before you go online @woolieversus
[4:09:50] <Bonebagmel> that guy didn't go to the end of the line lol, I think
[4:09:55] <RyuuAoi> SF x Tekken
[4:09:56] <Applecannon63> how about Capcom vs Snk?
[4:09:57] <%Irridium> oh a wild gorilla
[4:10:07] <%Josef_Stryker> The plane stage in SFV is the WORST
[4:10:08] <%jolene_orenji> can we all agree fuck training stages
[4:10:18] <@Solidus_113> brazilian sol
[4:10:26] <+KennyKRool> Brazil
[4:10:26] <%townzzzzz> THAT'S A LOT OF ROLLBACK
[4:10:30] <+KennyKRool> VIVE BRAZIL
[4:10:32] <%Irridium> YO ROLLBACK 7 LET'S GO
[4:10:34] <WeijiBeng> SOME GAMES
[4:10:34] <+RemedyofRevenge> RUN
[4:10:36] <%jolene_orenji> I think it's because you're playing an actual australian LUL
[4:10:38] <%Noonoox12> BRAZIL ROLLBACK LET'S GOOOO
[4:10:41] <WeijiBeng> You better like the training mode
[4:10:42] <%Sparkseid> Brazilian wifi Sol
[4:10:43] <+RemedyofRevenge> EJECT
[4:10:44] <Hericknhx> nah this is not brazillian Sol, im from brazil I play with gringos and feels good KEKW
[4:10:45] <+nellen55> ya ppl playing SFV for years only on training stage
[4:10:46] <%Mrthefro> Pls nerf teleport 6s
[4:10:47] <%Irridium> Brazil out in force
[4:10:51] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[4:10:53] <+KennyKRool> Oh, someone from Australia is in the lobby because he just wants to play with friends
[4:10:55] <Brandon__Brando> people stop the stream when playing
[4:10:57] <+Canti510> WOOF
[4:10:58] <ElPlasa> Australian Sol
[4:11:00] <%Irridium> YEYEYE
[4:11:02] <Bonebagmel> This is nights,
[4:11:02] <onyx_g13> whoa that was a big one
[4:11:02] <Strykerdown> Rollback sol has teleports
[4:11:02] <%Noonoox12> Brazilian Wifi Sol conquers all!
[4:11:09] <+Superbro64> considering that ArcSys probably intends to release additional stages as dlc, optimizing the stages so people actually *buy* them sounds like problem #1
[4:11:09] <HitchhikingThrough> oh hey its that dude sol punchguy
[4:11:12] <FpsRaptor> LUL
[4:11:13] <%Irridium> THEM ROLLBACK JUMPS SON THAT'S HOW YOU KNOW IT'S REAL
[4:11:16] <@Solidus_113> FS
[4:11:22] <+Canti510> you guys gotta stop chugging bandwidth while fighting lol
[4:11:22] <+RemedyofRevenge> Sol Wi-Guy
[4:11:24] <+megaman_sentinel> someone stop the fight
[4:11:24] <HitchhikingThrough> Sol SlashGuy
[4:11:24] <+Superbro64> WiFi Ken, meet WiFi Sol
[4:11:26] <%jolene_orenji> Sol WiFi
[4:11:26] <morow1ec> Sol Lagguy
[4:11:27] <DrkJP520> Those are some sick teleporting moves
[4:11:28] <%Afterman_> sol mastered space time
[4:11:28] <CarmineAcciai> Sol BadFi.
[4:11:31] <bigshedman> Sol BadWiFi LUL
[4:11:33] <Hericknhx> GGs @WoolieVersus shake his hands Kappa
[4:11:33] <+nellen55> this sol should not be allowed on ranked lol
[4:11:35] <RyuuAoi> CHEAT
[4:11:36] <%jolene_orenji> @Superbro64 I think extra stages are confirmed
[4:11:42] <Bonebagmel> Jump rollbacks are the worse (this goes to all chip players doing 3J into spin kick
[4:11:43] <fakespecialist> wait isnt boward an australian?
[4:11:47] <+TitanGigante> Slow Languy
[4:11:47] <Brandon__Brando> Wifi sol vs Brazilan ken
[4:11:50] <%Josef_Stryker> It's bad enough they're playing Sol, they're on Wi-Fi too?
[4:11:50] <+Superbro64> @jolene_orenji I was 90% sure, yea
[4:12:08] <+Superbro64> strive needs optimization, a low spec option, or a pc benchmark
[4:12:08] <%jinking79> sol doesn't want whiff punish he wants those plus frames
[4:12:10] <%Sparkseid> yep
[4:12:11] <Daniel_Is_I> Same guy
[4:12:14] <inorwise> i thought reggie was selecting sol lmao
[4:12:15] <%jolene_orenji> oh fuck I gotta play an axl now?
[4:12:16] <Demoli_PT> same guy
[4:12:20] <+nellen55> i hope they can fix it
[4:12:20] <RyuuAoi> EVEN FAILED THE REMATCH
[4:12:20] <passserby> can't play in polar bear cafe anymore FeelsBadMan
[4:12:28] <+KennyKRool> When you Say GG but it was actually BG
[4:12:28] <HitchhikingThrough> oh he popped out of existence
[4:12:31] <%arcturusblade> is the stage performance issue on all platforms?
[4:12:31] <fakespecialist> boward is indeed an aus
[4:12:34] <fakespecialist> wtf boward
[4:12:36] <+UberWolfman> Im suprised snow stage is not as bad preformance wise
[4:12:38] <%jolene_orenji> @passserby ALL THE GOOD STAGES ARE LAGGY I HATE IT
[4:12:53] <+nellen55> banning stages sucks for sure
[4:12:53] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:12:53] <%jolene_orenji> don't play smash bros then woolie
[4:12:57] <Strykerdown> Oh it's says we're on pc on stream I feel so dumb that I asked if they were on it
[4:12:58] <RyuuAoi> It's fine, Woolie. I like it!
[4:13:12] <+KennyKRool> Gio theme chrisPls
[4:13:23] <+UberWolfman> "WE TALKIN FUNCTIONS?" LUL
[4:13:31] <%jolene_orenji> chat what's the best character theme in the game and why is it zato's
[4:13:32] <VanLynx> I mean you're not wrong to be upset
[4:13:37] <SpookyBeef7> To me that one stage in KOF 13 where everything is just bleach white remains my most hated stage.
[4:13:40] <ElPlasa> @jolene_orenji because it is
[4:13:41] <+Superbro64> reminder that Gigantic was doomed to die because despite warning players that if they didnt have enough ram, they couldnt run the game, people bought it anyway and disliked it on steam to hell @woolieversus
[4:13:43] <RyuuAoi> PAT
[4:13:44] <+Superbro64> f
[4:13:50] <%d1stantutopia> @jolene_orenji I-No's, no contest
[4:13:57] <Demoli_PT> @jolene_orenji sorry zato doesnt fight like a tiger
[4:14:03] <bigshedman> @Strykerdown Don't worry, Woolie put that text there when Reggie started playing ;)
[4:14:05] <+Checktrap> you should block low
[4:14:09] <+Checktrap> LUL
[4:14:14] <+KennyKRool> Zato fights like 2 guys who both hate you
[4:14:19] <Hericknhx> tbh alot of things were pushed back because of covid, so ArcSys maybe is already working on fixing them... I hope LUL
[4:14:21] <%jolene_orenji> @check
[4:14:23] <%jolene_orenji> heck
[4:14:31] <%jolene_orenji> @Checktrap haha get it cuz his name is axl low-
[4:14:32] <+FuqBoiSlim> it's actually a tie between nago and gio. sorry, chat
[4:14:48] <+Checktrap> @jolene_orenji exaCTLY
[4:14:55] <+Superbro64> Strive blanderizing all the stages for people on potatoes is one thing, but I wonder if stage lag complaints are a thing with ps4 / ps5 too
[4:14:58] <%RealThiele> Axl high would be way more chill about his time situation
[4:15:00] <+Superbro64> does anyone know?
[4:15:03] <Strykerdown> @bigshedman Aight cool
[4:15:04] <Brandon__Brando> ky is on list to
[4:15:07] <%d1stantutopia> I reiterate, I-No's theme is the best. No apology necessary.
[4:15:13] <%jolene_orenji> god I can't get over the spit noise that gio makes when she recalls her doggo why did they make that the sound
[4:15:13] <%livlinn> paw shoes paw shoes
[4:15:16] <%Irridium> @FuqBoiSlim facts
[4:15:17] <Daniel_Is_I> GG Reggie
[4:15:18] <Hericknhx> @Superbro64 I play on PS4 and I don't feel the lag
[4:15:26] <+Superbro64> @jolene_orenji blame max doodBait
[4:15:31] <%jolene_orenji> @livlinn I'd buy those tbh
[4:15:36] <%livlinn> I NEED Gio's shoes woolieOMG
[4:15:49] <%slayabee> @d1stantutopia But Ky theme though. But Nago though.
[4:15:51] <Brandon__Brando> I think the bad maps where just bad internet connections
[4:15:52] <%Deft_Thought> I hope we get EX Moves
[4:15:53] <HitchhikingThrough> Come on Asuka Projectile Slam
[4:15:54] <+KennyKRool> Round start DP?
[4:15:54] <%jolene_orenji> nago's is really good
[4:15:56] <+KennyKRool> True Leo main here
[4:15:57] <Hericknhx> @Superbro64 don't know if Im dumb so I can't noticed the lag, but It was nevers that bad
[4:15:57] <HitchhikingThrough> *spam
[4:16:04] <onyx_g13> Right now I just want some Ky buffs lol
[4:16:14] <+Superbro64> next dlc character is bedman, and he has 60 special moves and 3 extra meter bars Kappa
[4:16:15] <%d1stantutopia> @slayabee the true answer is that all themes are amazing, duh
[4:16:20] <%townzzzzz> want characters to get theirs moves back
[4:16:41] <%Deft_Thought> @townzzzzz Fer real
[4:16:48] <Heefnoff> Reggie you got the loops?
[4:16:54] <+KennyKRool> Reggie tried the loops
[4:16:57] <+KennyKRool> THey hard tho
[4:17:00] <%jinking79> let's go Leo
[4:17:01] <WeijiBeng> to be honest we only agree with that mentality because they nerf characters to the ground where you cant play him anymore
[4:17:02] <Heefnoff> For sure
[4:17:03] <Shaners> Or do as the almighty Keits and "burf" characters
[4:17:08] <%Josef_Stryker> "Don't Nerf, Only Buff" I feel works when it's less that the Top Tier characters are too good and more that the Low Tiers aren't up to par
[4:17:09] <%Irridium> the loops are indeed hard
[4:17:10] <Heefnoff> I have decent execution, I can’t do them consistently
[4:17:19] <Heefnoff> Big respect to Axl players
[4:17:22] <+Checktrap> 2S for AA Reggie LUL
[4:17:23] <HitchhikingThrough> caps stop dp'ing please
[4:17:23] <%Deft_Thought> I'd like the cast to get as much combo variety as Sol
[4:17:28] <%athuramn> sol: only buffs, you say
[4:17:29] <Daniel_Is_I> I felt like a total gorilla fighting Axl. Wasn't doing anything clever.
[4:17:44] <Demoli_PT> this guy does cross up slashe very time
[4:17:45] <+Superbro64> reminder that this is ArcSys, and it took them until Xrd Rev 2 to finally not have Raven be overpowered
[4:17:47] <Heefnoff> There’s no need to be a genius in every match, you know?
[4:17:49] <Hericknhx> if they're in the air they can crossup I Tthink @WoolieVersus
[4:17:49] <Heefnoff> Do what works.
[4:17:50] <Bonebagmel> he just did
[4:17:50] <+Superbro64> ignoring Johnny memes
[4:17:58] <mrsandmando> Which lobby are they in?
[4:17:58] <%Josef_Stryker> Would u rather Sol get nerfed to be more manageable or everyone to get buffed to his level?
[4:18:01] <%alcors_wisdom> alcors_wisdom subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months, currently on a 8 month streak! aye finally got a chance to drop in youre the only streamer that i actually enjoy watching play fighting games even though i hate playing them myself
[4:18:09] <%Deft_Thought> That was some tricky shit, Reggie
[4:18:15] <%Noonoox12> @Josef_Stryker I'm in the buff everyone else camp
[4:18:15] <Hericknhx> saving the burst for next game Kappa
[4:18:18] <%RealThiele> everyone at Sol level would just be unga fafnit shit
[4:18:19] <%jolene_orenji> @Josef_Stryker I shutter to think of what a sol-level potemkin could get away with
[4:18:20] <Bonebagmel> he kept the burst for his next game
[4:18:20] <+Mrbaconator> im here once again to submit my JobGrapplication for a second interview
[4:18:23] <+KennyKRool> Lets go Reggie!
[4:18:26] <%Irridium> @WoolieVersus I think it's height related in regards to rensen crossing up. Not sure on the exact height though
[4:18:31] <+KennyKRool> Give everyone 6S
[4:18:37] <+R0kushi> it doesnt work like that
[4:18:38] <+TitanGigante> @Josef_Stryker frame 1 buster
[4:18:39] <Aydarkzero> that's prob not the best option
[4:18:39] <mrsandmando> Buffing everyone else literally only works in theory.
[4:18:42] <@Solidus_113> that's going back to Beta 1 damage
[4:18:51] <RyuuAoi> Reggie is pretty alright!
[4:18:57] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Hericknhx
[4:18:57] <Brandon__Brando> naw that's too much buffing
[4:19:04] <%Irridium> Sol getting like 50% at least off of any stray hit
[4:19:05] <+DeaconBluesClues> just nerf him
[4:19:10] <%d1stantutopia> nerf Sol slightly - ding 6S and reduce clean hit Volcanic Viper damage - then buff everyone else to that level
[4:19:17] <+Superbro64> I like the creativity that Sol has, I do not like how he seemingly has very little weaknesses. I prefer ArcSys balance this game with a design philosophy in mind, then doing whatever
[4:19:17] <+DeaconBluesClues> shoot the bastard with the nerf gun
[4:19:20] <Hericknhx> Pot Buster full scream Ppog
[4:19:24] <Megafang2145> nerf the absolute most egregious things?
[4:19:26] <fakespecialist> are you questioning daisuke's vison?!
[4:19:26] <WeijiBeng> I have a wrong opnion about sol, he's the only old GG character in this new GG
[4:19:30] <mrsandmando> Just nerf sol. This buff everyone else nonsenses needs to stop.
[4:19:31] <%Irridium> JobGrapplication is a good name
[4:19:38] <%jolene_orenji> @Hericknhx you mean kara bustering? naroSmug
[4:19:39] <%RealThiele> Free hammerfall returns LUL

[4:20:05] <%jolene_orenji> @RealThiele hammerfall becomes +5 on block
[4:20:06] <DrkJP520> Would you rather Nago get buffed, or everyone else nerfed to his level?
[4:20:09] <%Josef_Stryker> Well this is just bullying
[4:20:11] <Brandon__Brando> sol is going to get treated like sfv nash

[4:22:02] <%jolene_orenji> @Superbro64 other people were saying "if you're new you should play who you like and see who you feel comfortable with" while arcsys was just like "lmao just pick sol"
[4:22:04] <+R0kushi> nah, he uses socks with sandals

[4:24:11] <%Irridium> here's what you do reggie: try to at least die with dignity
[4:24:16] <+Superbro64> despite the low health, and can definitely see why Chipp is a top 2 character right now
[4:24:16] <%RealThiele> coxSays coxBuffalo coxHook
[4:24:19] <Daniel_Is_I> I feel like Axl is probably one of Chipp's worse matchups

[4:26:23] <someyounguy1> he can heat knuckle that jump attack too. its nuts
[4:26:29] <Hericknhx> that's too
[4:26:33] <Hericknhx> and you can flish rensen
[4:26:35] <+KennyKRool> Reggie the call out of call out
[4:26:37] <Hericknhx> flick*
[4:26:38] <%Irridium> Rensen just stuffs everything pot has at range
[4:26:40] <Strykerdown> Chipp may be paper but her sure makes you feel outplayed until he' s dead and neither of us knows why
[4:26:41] <CarmineAcciai> Oh wow, that super destroys the framerate.
[4:26:45] <%Noonoox12> @Superbro64 also, oceania 4 for posterity
[4:26:49] <Afrosamasenpai> pot boys pot boys pot boys
[4:27:03] <Hericknhx> Pot has alot of ways to deal with rensen
[4:27:03] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:27:06] <Hericknhx> but is hard
[4:27:10] <Brandon__Brando> pot boys b
[4:27:11] <zenith0111> Reggie on that Axl grind? hocNega
[4:27:13] <bigshedman> PogChamp Love the subhuman self
[4:27:13] <+KennyKRool> It combos depending on a lot of things. its inconsistent
[4:27:13] <CarmineAcciai> What song is this?
[4:27:16] <CarmineAcciai> Oh xD
[4:27:19] <Storm_Samurai> So is Axl basically Dhalsim archetype?
[4:27:22] <+Superbro64> @noonoox12 avatar is may, name is "may is my waifu", plays Zato sajamBaldy
[4:27:23] <@Solidus_113> Millia's theme

[4:27:44] <he1lhydra> "i'm trying" he says as he air dashes back in c805BuuHoo
[4:27:55] <%athuramn> kinda but with more ability to deal with nonsense @storm_samurai
[4:28:00] <RyuuAoi> Reggie for championships?
[4:28:00] <+Checktrap> exactly what I though
[4:28:03] <zenith0111> @storm_samurai He used to be a bit better close range in past GGs with a DP and Parry
[4:28:07] <someyounguy1> at least pot can double jump and slide head
[4:28:08] <+Canti510> It's a DIFFICULT matchup
[4:28:10] <DasFreekman> I hate that match, not as bad as zato, but still horrible
[4:28:12] <+BottledLineArt> It's pretty bad for Pot.
[4:28:12] <Storm_Samurai> @athuramn and less yoga
[4:28:13] <Hericknhx> @WoolieVersus according to Octo, it is Pot worst MU
[4:28:16] <bigshedman> At least Pot has a double jump LUL Nago has fucking nothing.
[4:28:18] <Brandon__Brando> it is
[4:28:19] <%athuramn> LUL
[4:28:29] <Demoli_PT> no there are way more people
[4:28:37] <Hericknhx> you have flick to deal with rensen
[4:28:44] <zenith0111> As an Axl player who Subs Potemkin. Its relaly not his worst
[4:28:45] <Finchit> Is the line big? I kinda wanna play em but idk how long they gonna be on
[4:28:49] <+KennyKRool> Not as bad as the zato vs pot matchup IMO
[4:28:53] <Hericknhx> and jHS is your best friend
[4:28:54] <zenith0111> I would argue its 50/50
[4:29:00] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[4:29:03] <@Solidus_113> wow
[4:29:04] <+R0kushi> daaaaamn
[4:29:05] <%Sparkseid> LUL
[4:29:06] <Hericknhx> I HATE THAT
[4:29:08] <+PianoAlone> yep
[4:29:08] <%Irridium> yep LUL
[4:29:12] <Ciglossonjr> Oh my god
[4:29:12] <Hericknhx> I HATE WHEN AXL DOES THAT
[4:29:12] <+Superbro64> I wonder if pot / axl having less specials made the mu between them worse or better
[4:29:13] <%slayabee> Get fucked Pot
[4:29:14] <%RealThiele> oof right through it
[4:29:17] <bigshedman> Reggie you are just bullying Pot's at this point LUL
[4:29:33] <Strykerdown> I feel like my matches against Pot last 40% longer than other matches *or* I die in two command grabs
[4:29:40] <Storm_Samurai> July 17 and no DLC character yet...I'm hoping next week
[4:29:53] <%Irridium> @Storm_Samurai they announced an announcement for the 20th
[4:29:57] <+fetrigon> he almost jumped LUL
[4:29:57] <skumbag_megumi> oooooh, story teller catJAM
[4:29:58] <Storm_Samurai> oh right i forgot
[4:29:58] <zenith0111> Axl used to have to have multi hitting normals so his armor would break all the time
[4:30:03] <Hericknhx> oh wow Axl 6P worked for once KEKW
[4:30:07] <+Superbro64> axl so confident he invades pot's personal space, smh
[4:30:11] <+Superbro64> sajamTanjiro
[4:30:12] <Magicferret> Wakeup garuda impact is probably not the option
[4:30:12] <zenith0111> Potemkin can relflect rensen
[4:30:15] <Hericknhx> @WoolieVersus you can flick rensen
[4:30:16] <%Sparkseid> Reggie is correct
[4:30:17] <Ciglossonjr> He's supposed to die
[4:30:18] <Brandon__Brando> cry
[4:30:18] <%Deft_Thought> SUFFER
[4:30:21] <%RealThiele> there is no meme just die
[4:30:26] <zenith0111> No other character can reflect Rensen but Potemkin is the only one
[4:30:31] <+Superbro64> vip ram monkaS
[4:30:36] <+call_me_comic> why are they in OCE #4?
[4:30:37] <zenith0111> Its really not that bad for Pot
[4:30:37] <+KennyKRool> Celestial Floor ramlethal monkaS
[4:30:43] <Storm_Samurai> i love that 500k units sold artwork
[4:30:56] <Hericknhx> flick for Pot is acctually really good in this game, since it's easier to flick things
[4:31:02] <zenith0111> Axl also has one of the lowest health in the game and can be TOD x.x
[4:31:04] <Frogwash> @call_me_comic Lower amount of people, and its peer-to-peer so server doesn't matter otherwise
[4:31:05] <+Superbro64> I do not wish a good ram on my worst enemies
[4:31:13] <Storm_Samurai> @Hericknhx can you flick projectiles?
[4:31:15] <+Superbro64> Ill have my family pray for you Woolie lol
[4:31:20] <+Superbro64> sajamSegue3
[4:31:25] <Hericknhx> @Storm_Samurai the move main use is for that
[4:31:45] <Storm_Samurai> @Hericknhx what about double hitting ones like ky
[4:31:46] <zenith0111> If youre not flicking with potemkin play someone else
[4:31:48] <bearwagon> this ram aint gonna break wall for more combo
[4:31:56] <Hericknhx> @Storm_Samurai the flick wins LUL
[4:32:00] <he1lhydra> but garuda impact tho
[4:32:04] <he1lhydra> that move is hilarious
[4:32:13] <+Superbro64> dang, ram literally threw her sword away at match start
[4:32:15] <+Superbro64> haha
[4:32:18] <Hericknhx> if you flick a fireball 90% flick is going to win
[4:32:27] <Storm_Samurai> bite nom nom
[4:32:27] <+Superbro64> this might be a wash boys
[4:32:29] <RyuuAoi> Welp...
[4:32:43] <%RealThiele> not a celestial ram
[4:32:50] <zenith0111> @hericknhx Flick was actually changed! if you hold it it automatically relfects!
[4:32:53] <Storm_Samurai> launched into orbit
[4:32:55] <+yeknomlive> what mod is that nago color referencing

[4:35:46] <%Irridium> @LorcaNomad and then it kicks you out of training mode because "too many matches going on at the same time"
[4:35:52] <+KennyKRool> Good Trade
[4:35:55] <Meltgar> @LorcaNomad Cabs don't load up if someone is on them?
[4:35:59] <zenith0111> @irridium Exactly!

[4:39:16] <Bonebagmel> That made me feel tired
[4:39:17] <+Superbro64> @strykerdown it could be worse, this game could have elphelt in it
[4:39:29] <zenith0111> You can backdash j.2k
[4:39:38] <Meltgar> @WoolieVersus Woolie, any way to approach a defensive nago as pot? With the whole range he has it's hard, also hammer fall gets whacked by low HS
[4:39:47] <+KennyKRool> Yeah chips command grab is dumb good
[4:39:54] <LorcaNomad> @Superbro64 don't you mean jack-o wait nevermind I don't know how she plays lol

[4:41:06] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:41:06] <someyounguy1> that bite was at the absolute last second
[4:41:11] <+Arnschen> ABCDEFGo
[4:41:30] <Strykerdown> Also they could probably make Elphelt balanced in a new game right?
[4:41:38] <+Superbro64> @strykerdown elphelt returns but arcys deletes the pineberry Kappa
[4:41:51] <+KennyKRool> I agree that they could make elphelt
[4:41:52] <%LastHazzerd> amazing how big slow characters feel so tense
[4:41:54] <Meltgar> @Strykerdown Never managed to get REV, how was she in the game? Heard that the nade spam was nightmare
[4:41:56] <+KennyKRool> Idk if she will be balanced
[4:41:57] <Hericknhx> I wonder if Elphlet will return
[4:41:57] <Playerbam> damn, couldn't even last throught the chorus
[4:42:01] <+nellen55> he needs tp zone
[4:42:05] <Hericknhx> I could see Sin coming back
[4:42:11] <%RealThiele> Bedwoman when

[4:42:40] <%Axle13j> Kliff and Abba would be awesome
[4:42:46] <+KennyKRool> Like that furry ninja from Overture
[4:42:48] <+R0kushi> delilah well, she is MENTIONED in strive
[4:42:49] <%RealThiele> bummer
[4:42:50] <someyounguy1> delilah will probably come back when happy chaos gets up to his next saturday morning shenanigan
[4:42:54] <Spirit_9B> they'll just rename him Deadman
[4:42:58] <%Deft_Thought> @R0kushi *Thankfully
[4:42:59] <drhivesphd> is woolie playing nago?
[4:43:01] <jemeralddragoon> what lobby we in?
[4:43:03] <Meltgar> Is Izuna a "pick" for GG?
[4:43:06] <+Arnschen> Ooof
[4:43:07] <@Solidus_113> I mostly want ABA, but Nago already plays a lot like her
[4:43:09] <+KennyKRool> Oceania 4 JetpackMcQuack
[4:43:12] <zenith0111> I remember in another stream they had a mod watch the line and perma their twitch account for cutting
[4:43:13] <%Irridium> @jemeralddragoon oceana park 4
[4:43:18] <+KennyKRool> oceiana 4 jemeralddragoon
[4:43:19] <primaryfire> always the rams
[4:43:22] <jemeralddragoon> thank you <3
[4:43:24] <%Deft_Thought> I'd like A.B.A to come back but--yeah, what Solidus said
[4:43:27] <+Superbro64> like apparently shes just walking around now with little explanation, unless I missed how she came to from wherever she was in rev 2
[4:43:28] <%Sparkseid> every time
[4:43:30] <skumbag_megumi> @KennyKRool why oceania?
[4:43:31] <+nellen55> ram's super is so good
[4:43:35] <%Deft_Thought> I think ABA was a lot more concentrated on Rushdown
[4:43:38] <Strykerdown> imma turn off chat so I can actually see the stream
[4:43:39] <Hericknhx> I legit want Holy Order Sol back
[4:43:41] <+KennyKRool> Becuase no one else is using these @skumbag_megumi
[4:43:48] <%Deft_Thought> I feel like her blood system is more interesting and less punishing than Nago
[4:43:51] <Hericknhx> even if dosen't make sense his back
[4:43:53] <Meltgar> i have PTSD of that super LUL
[4:43:59] <zenith0111> @superbro64 ABA story apparently went through some retcons
[4:44:07] <%Sparkseid> Sick
[4:44:07] <someyounguy1> cant dp the bite

[4:45:53] <+Maxthetics> Is that Melvin, brother of the joker?
[4:46:04] <Ferrousphantom> hes insane!
[4:46:04] <LorcaNomad> from what I can tell by cross-referencing Woolie's lore videos and Strive's glossary, ABA's story looks pretty much the same, though I dunno if woolie took that into account @zenith0111
[4:46:13] <Hericknhx> I quoted in DustLoop, "We trained him wrong, as a joke" - Slayer 4Head
[4:46:27] <Hericknhx> As quoted*
[4:46:34] <Meltgar> Millia is the 2nd of lowest HP right?
[4:46:37] <Meltgar> Chipp is the 1st?

[4:48:39] <Hericknhx> he's so good
[4:48:45] <Brandon__Brando> that's how I feel about nago
[4:48:48] <Meltgar> Zato if you don't have eddie around you need to block

[4:55:40] <zenith0111> @superbro64 They changed it because it wallbreaks. You want unblockable anti air grabs in the corner?
[4:55:44] <TigerClaws12> he is CHURNIN that butter LUL
[4:56:29] <CarmineAcciai> Wait, you can fukyo out of spin?
[4:56:33] <CarmineAcciai> HOly shit.
[4:56:38] <%RealThiele> 0 technique LUL
[4:56:47] <+Lord0Mugen> @WoolieVersus did you like Tusk in KI? Because Nago feels like a Tusk with instinct always on and if you run out you die.
[4:56:56] <+tkzhyon> damn wools are you celestial?
[4:56:57] <RoxMoxie> Nago seems so frustrating to fight. Big ups to the patience on Woolz and that Pot.
[4:57:07] <bigshedman> @CarmineAcciai Yeah, Nago can cancel (almost) any special into another. Fukyo is great to make specials more safe or just doing mixup shit.
[4:57:14] <+Superbro64> @zenith0111 hey man, I play gg, I hate all characters that arent Leo or Leo's best MU :)
[4:57:20] <CarmineAcciai> I've got like 50ish hour on Nago and I still didn't know that.
[4:57:32] <ElPlasa> @Superbro64 Spoken like a true GG player
[4:57:32] <%RealThiele> woolie gonna steal this pie
[4:57:39] <+tkzhyon> love nagos laugh when he gets ko'd
[4:57:41] <+UberWolfman> aanyone know any good tips for doing kara cancels? its my biggest weakness as a pot main.
[4:57:41] <CarmineAcciai> I knew he can combo specials into other specials but didn't know fukyo into spin was a thing.
[4:57:42] <zenith0111> @superbro64 Damn I love all the characters :( idk how anyone can even maim in this series
[4:58:05] <zenith0111> Everyones just too cool to not play

[4:58:21] <pirateofpie> Haha, what a wash
[4:58:23] <jemeralddragoon> @zenith0111 just main everyone xD
[4:58:29] <CarmineAcciai> I particularly like blue and gold Nago.
[4:58:36] <Brandon__Brando> @zenith0111 there's a good benefit to knowing how to play every character
[4:58:47] <%Axle13j> Green Nago and Red Nago ftw

[5:08:39] <%Irridium> the mix-up
[5:08:52] <%Grimlockfly> Chipp will only be good when you lose immediately upon picking him after character select. Cheer500
[5:08:59] <+complexstupidity> is strive good for new comers. it looks scary honestly
[5:09:01] <SPidERMan8576> I like axl but man those axl bomber loops is hard

[5:09:31] <%diegobandzz> Ahh shit
[5:09:31] <SPidERMan8576> reggie on keyboard
[5:09:41] <+Superbro64> Back when I played BBTag, everyone I went up against always changed their characters before I got used to the matchup. I understand why they did it. Still drove me up a wall every time
[5:10:00] <+complexstupidity> @grimlockfly hmm, I've heard it's actually pretty accessable. maybe I will get it
[5:10:26] <+Superbro64> Blazblue Lore when? :)

[5:10:47] <%Grimlockfly> @complexstupidity there's a 'what you need to know' level that is easy to get the hang of, and there is more you can learn if you choose to pursue
[5:10:54] <Hericknhx> question chat
[5:11:07] <TigerClaws12> @Superbro64 right after Kingdom Hearts lore
[5:11:07] <Hericknhx> it is wierd that after playing Pot I wanna try Axl
[5:11:08] <+complexstupidity> hell yeah @grimlockfly thank you
[5:11:20] <Hericknhx> I feel Im betraying the Pot Bros FeelsBadMan
[5:11:21] <+Superbro64> @tigerclaws12 whens kirby lore smh
[5:11:29] <SPidERMan8576> after playing chipp, axl feels weird to play lol
[5:11:34] <+tkzhyon> guys who is more bri ish, Axl Low or Steve Fox miirioGuv
[5:11:36] <+lbhosdelgado> I don't typically tune into woolie's streams, what's his friend's name?
[5:11:42] <zenith0111> LUL Reggie thinking the Axl life is EZ
[5:11:47] <+tkzhyon> @lbhosdelgado Reggie
[5:11:48] <+lbhosdelgado> Ah that answers that hahaha
[5:11:48] <%Grimlockfly> @lbhosdelgado Reggie
[5:12:01] <infiltratian> Reggie
[5:12:04] <%livlinn> woolieKICKDAD
[5:12:15] <+Superbro64> one vision was nerfed so hard, Axl now has 1 super KEKW
[5:12:22] <jemeralddragoon> oooooooooh REGGIE
[5:12:33] <SPidERMan8576> one vision is still good
[5:12:35] <zenith0111> I use one vision all the time.
[5:12:41] <zenith0111> Its + on block
[5:12:49] <SPidERMan8576> sweep into one vision is a good setup
[5:12:52] <%Grimlockfly> @complexstupidity also one of the best things about this game: the Command list will show you a video of every move, and tells you EXACTLY what it does, why it's good, and what it's weak against
[5:12:56] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Aaah Reggie, or some say Reginald, do you hear our prayers?
[5:13:03] <%Irridium> bro just block when he's in blood rage
[5:13:07] <+Superbro64> the few axls I ran into definitely use the wakup fire wheel super more
[5:13:17] <+Superbro64> I actually have yet to see an Axl use the other one
[5:13:21] <zenith0111> Its a really good reversal
[5:13:26] <+KennyKRool> @FightningX Turns out its something wrong with my setup. Sorry. I can't fihgt anyone online right now
[5:13:29] <Hericknhx> @Superbro64 it's the only reversal he has KEK
[5:13:29] <SPidERMan8576> wake up firewheel is his only reversal lol
[5:13:31] <zenith0111> One vision requires brain
[5:13:35] <+Superbro64> then again, I have seen Axl's and Ino's the least
[5:13:37] <+Ancisace> Wait...is this a fight game
[5:13:49] <+Superbro64> @hericknhx f
[5:13:51] <TigerClaws12> it's plus too LUL

[5:14:04] <zenith0111> "Whats the point of a super that does no damage they say" but can give corner to corner wallbreaks
[5:14:14] <%Grimlockfly> the fight game is plus?

[5:17:33] <+Ancisace> I'm not so sure this is an RPG. These encounters don't seem random
[5:17:33] <%Grimlockfly> @jemeralddragoon some good taste there. grimlo8Grimrich
[5:17:38] <zenith0111> Its punishable on hit.
[5:17:49] <zenith0111> They need to buff Axls 2p NOW
[5:18:05] <+Superbro64> @ancisace Woolie is grinding the field for low level Axl's right now
[5:18:23] <+Superbro64> they have a low % chance of dropping rare anti Axl tech
[5:18:27] <+Ancisace> Ooooh, that makes sense. Thanks for clarifying
[5:18:54] <+Superbro64> need the gear before you fight endgame boss Axl's, you know?
[5:19:01] <+Ancisace> Legit
[5:19:12] <zenith0111> Nagos jHS can hit Axls anti airs if spaced right
[5:19:22] <zenith0111> and his clone can call out rensen
[5:19:29] <SPidERMan8576> Got ate

[5:22:12] <+Checktrap> no more curfew over here
[5:22:25] <zenith0111> Otherwise Axls jK is his go to air move
[5:22:41] <+Superbro64> @checktrap nice
[5:23:05] <+Checktrap> been a lil more than a month

[5:24:08] <+Ancisace> Yeah, we're getting F'd in the A.
[5:24:12] <+Ancisace> But economy tho
[5:24:47] <TigerClaws12> lmfao
[5:24:49] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> THE SELF MIX
[5:24:53] <+Checktrap> @Superbro64 seems like we might get past it over here other parts of Canada are doing a lot worse than us
[5:25:08] <%Axle13j> That was sick
[5:25:10] <zenith0111> Yeee all momentum from the hits in timestop carey over. So you should ALWAYS combo after time stop
[5:25:20] <ThorW> He was too high on the wall splat for the stage break
[5:25:26] <+Superbro64> @checktrap dang
[5:25:56] <+Superbro64> well to be fair, it aint all sunshine and rainbows over here either
[5:25:59] <TigerClaws12> yea it crossed up during super
[5:26:24] <+Checktrap> I mean it comes with it. SHit was strict AF over here so we got results that show that.
[5:26:35] <+lbhosdelgado> Is timestop useful at all? I see chipps use it so rarely
[5:26:44] <+Superbro64> something tells me everything will open up fully by autumn / winter, and then it'll get worse again
[5:26:50] <+lbhosdelgado> Saw one setup that gave a high/low but it was reactable and ehhh
[5:26:53] <+Checktrap> agreed
[5:26:54] <%d1stantutopia> guys, at least you all aren't cursed to live in Boris Johnson's Petri Dish, the UK
[5:27:01] <zenith0111> @lbhosdelgado Bruh thats not Chipp

[5:27:22] <+Superbro64> @d1stantutopia major fs bro LUL
[5:27:27] <+Superbro64> sounds rough
[5:27:42] <%Sparkseid> LUL
[5:27:45] <zenith0111> @lbhosdelgado It super situational. Its only good for getting long ramge combos
[5:28:02] <zenith0111> Damage is hard to maximize but its good for wallbreaks
[5:28:08] <+samuraiskitz> This axls really timid
[5:28:10] <+lbhosdelgado> Yea I played like a solid 50 games against kanto kinte's axl and he didn't use it a single time so I figured it's just trash mostly
[5:28:14] <%d1stantutopia> Highest infection rate in Europe but Monday is "freedom day" where all restrictions and mask mandates aree lifted
[5:28:26] <%d1stantutopia> We'll be fine (:
[5:28:31] <+Superbro64> wow. actually for real?
[5:28:39] <zenith0111> @lbhosdelgado It is a Frame 1 super so I wouldnt sleep on it
[5:28:39] <+Superbro64> that sounds hilariously nightmarish
[5:28:44] <+lbhosdelgado> @d1stantutopia Jesus
[5:28:46] <zenith0111> But its not great
[5:29:12] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @d1stantutopia pogs in the chat for Borisland
[5:29:18] <+lbhosdelgado> Pog
[5:29:31] <%d1stantutopia> But of course, Parliament breaks for summer on Thursday and we can't have pesky things like covid public safety laws getting in the way of the MPs holidays
[5:29:56] <+lbhosdelgado> Gotta get the beach days, way more important
[5:30:01] <sleepy_pink> racking my mind for the series of events that led to them having to plaster "We're on PC" on the overlay
[5:30:16] <shaddydaddyo> people keep asking i'm sure
[5:30:19] <+lbhosdelgado> I think they were playing matches with viewers earlier
[5:30:29] <%Axle13j> Its bines
[5:30:29] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1414834352052215808?s=19
[5:30:39] <+Suneater_Jerome> I think people are still gonna keep asking as well haha
[5:30:51] <%Axle13j> hit enter by mistake lmao. Its honestly pretty efficient having it on the overlay
[5:30:58] <TigerClaws12> LUL
[5:31:16] <sleepy_pink> tbh yeah it probably just eliminates a lot of chaff
[5:31:17] <Hammatime8> Ooooo, that was a clutch!
[5:31:53] <+lbhosdelgado> Woolie gettin the cold shoulder lmao
[5:32:05] <%Sparkseid> Same
[5:32:08] <TigerClaws12> buttstuf LUL
[5:32:10] <+Superbro64> I cant wait for the dlc character to be Holy Order Sol PogChamp
[5:32:14] <%jinking79> well night everybody take care
[5:32:27] <%Irridium> butt stuff
[5:32:36] <+Ultimate_Edge> You have to manually "lock" ones you really like
[5:32:42] <kinggum41> Funny enough when I fight Nago he feels oppresive
[5:33:12] <+Superbro64> do the replays still show the wrong character in the preview?
[5:33:16] <+Superbro64> or did they patch that
[5:33:16] <%d1stantutopia> >I-No enjoyer LUL
[5:33:23] <+lbhosdelgado> Nago is def oppressive, pre blood 3 he has crazy pressure and then blood 3 he has the best neutral buttons in the game ScaredyCat
[5:33:35] <Hirumm> Player "Self"?
[5:33:43] <@SoushinSen> in search, i saw "follow self"
[5:33:43] <TigerClaws12> filter by self?
[5:33:46] <SunsetJack> There is a self option.
[5:34:05] <SunsetJack> It is in player.

[5:34:47] <+Superbro64> Axl doesnt have a bad color, dang
[5:34:48] <kinggum41> @lbhosdelgado especially as pot he can 2H me while I'm standing
[5:34:53] <TigerClaws12> 5P
[5:34:54] <+A_DEAD_SHOW> i'm mad that my axl is better than my giovanna
[5:35:13] <+lbhosdelgado> axl command grab is one of those things that should be easily reactable but I never react lmao
[5:35:16] <CarelessWhimper> Yooo you're fighting Ninja Gentleman? :D
[5:35:30] <CarelessWhimper> I should get games in on him again sometime soon 🤔
[5:35:38] <SunsetJack> I read that clone beats rensen (green sickle)?
[5:35:57] <$razielhex> quick ass round
[5:35:57] <+lbhosdelgado> oh yea I guess it prob is considered a projectile, damn that's good

[5:36:02] <CarelessWhimper> @SunsetJack it stuffs all projectiles ye, which rensen is
[5:36:08] <+lbhosdelgado> maybe that's why fame thinks nago does well against axl lol
[5:36:13] <+lbhosdelgado> to me it seems rough

[5:36:35] <CarelessWhimper> I dunno if I-no's projectiles being non-clashing means that it doesnt get cloned 🤔
[5:37:24] <CarelessWhimper> @lbhosdelgado Nago is real weird, cus i think he's godlike, but he has so many unfavorable MUs
