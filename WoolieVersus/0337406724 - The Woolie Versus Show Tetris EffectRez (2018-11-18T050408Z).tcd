[0:20:46] <MrBorisMakarov> It's fine
[0:20:47] <Flare3500> Woolie said you suck Billy
[0:20:48] <yuribo26> @SoushinSen he called you a fake naruto fan
[0:20:50] <TLPenn> Love this stream so far, Woolie; way better for background listening than Paige of Pat, especially live.
[0:20:50] <amiavamp> Imagine how impossible this would be to watch on Niconico
[0:20:51] <Oxnagadaba> @robertwlewis really??? thx for the info my guy
[0:20:53] <SteeScribbles> Billiam has entered the chat
[0:20:55] <+DatLatinoGuy> you can't beat Billy
[0:20:58] <prime_name> It's like Digimon World.
[0:21:01] <+DatLatinoGuy> Billy too stronk
[0:21:01] <gnarly_memes_bro> @SoushinSen woolie assumed you were ashamed of his play
[0:21:02] <fattydragon> Oh hey woolie! tieZilla
[0:21:02] <kvnmck94> OH SHIT, billy! here to be "fucking good"

[0:21:05] <PeachSaliva> @tlpenn Wow, thanks a lot
[0:21:06] <+superorangerobin> The Miz had someone tell him he can't improve on a classic and he just pointed to the stands

[0:23:36] <+superorangerobin> Exactly
[0:23:42] <amiavamp> @CertainlySyrix Not weird at all, especially since Spore also had music synced to actions
[0:23:44] <Solidus0101> There's a setting to make the blocks their original colors if that helps
[0:23:48] <+Someone_Kooky> my eyes are exploding
[0:23:49] <+robertwlewis> but we can see it so it is fine :)

[1:18:41] <grenadier42> What I've learned from this stream is that Woolie loves boiling frogs alive.
[1:18:43] <joydev> I heard it woolie! I heard the butthole pucker!
[1:18:43] <DeepFryedLogic> boiled to alive
[1:18:44] <Emdhad> BOI THATS A BUY FROM ME
[1:18:46] <prime_name> You want to kill Frogs?
[1:18:48] <Nikbottom> and frogs never leave cold pots
[1:18:49] <+Th3SmartAlec> You heard the man, roast him
[1:18:50] <+khalcipher> No roast from me sorry
[1:18:50] <Fkain23> velveleen dream is the experience
[1:18:53] <+sewermonk> fun fact in that experiment they actually removed the brains of the frog
[1:18:54] <kvnmck94> "dont lightspeed drop an L-block up my ass"
[1:18:56] <mistermastergreg> woo
[1:18:57] <+Dhrall> The frog in that was lobotomized before the experiment
[1:18:58] <loveplusearth> NAOTO
[1:18:59] <GohanEgret> s h i l l b o y z
[1:19:00] <yuribo26> evoShill evoShill evoShill evoShill evoShill
[1:19:01] <VanLynx> Solution: set world on fire. frog always gets roasted
[1:19:01] <gustavozxd> oh I'm gonna
[1:19:05] <+FistOfMonkey> did i miss a ultamatris
[1:19:05] <Triggerhappy938> Please support the official release
[1:19:08] <A_Classy_Gentleman> Universal appeal
[1:19:12] <+Menitta> I showed it to my mom. Her initial reaction was "It's distracting"
[1:19:12] <AlertDOTEXE> I would if it was on PC
[1:19:16] <Flare3500> I have a feeling it'll come to PC , they ported REZ to PC so theyll probably port this one too
[1:19:16] <T_Sasquatch> 40 bucks for tetris tho
[1:19:17] <Vyneci> Really hoping for a PC port for this one
[1:19:17] <Nikbottom> sponcered stream?
[1:19:20] <Sedrelic> my mom prob cant handle this
[1:19:20] <Sphincter_Spelunker> But is this on mobile? I have a phone, don't I
[1:19:21] <kvnmck94> is it PS4 only?
[1:19:21] <gnarly_memes_bro> SHOW>IT>TO>YOUR>MOM
[1:19:21] <+PeaceCentennial> This game visually is crazy
[1:19:29] <yuribo26> @T_Sasquatch you mean 40 bucks for digital drugs
[1:19:29] <laserbeaming> He wishes it was sponsored
[1:19:30] <dmysta3000> I'm seriously deciding between this, Spyro, and Pkmn: LGPE
[1:19:31] <+superorangerobin> I showed my dad the demo and he was like "Alright how much does this cost, we're getting it."
[1:19:31] <TwoStarPlayersNik> will do
[1:19:31] <grenadier42> Or just make TGM4
[1:19:31] <fattydragon> when's the paul ws anderson tetris movie
[1:19:34] <N1netbattler> should i follow tetris effect one twitch?
[1:19:35] <+superorangerobin> Like immediately
[1:19:37] <Dean_Inbetween> I would if it came out on switch and had multiplayer
[1:19:40] <itsya_boi_gappy> ill try woolie
[1:19:40] <gustavozxd> I'm gonna show this to everyone, especially if uninterested
[1:19:42] <yuribo26> @Nikbottom tetris sponsored Woolies life
[1:19:44] <+konekoryugamine> I sent my dad a clip of this
[1:19:47] <the_hidden_yeti> ah yes, the tetris franchise
[1:19:51] <+teh_rawk> i see hes taken a lot of ques from max
[1:19:53] <+khalcipher> not kids nowdays tho
[1:19:54] <Jaller101514> also vote for it being best VR game of the year
[1:19:56] <Nikbottom> What if Lumines was a tetris?
[1:19:58] <Dean_Inbetween> because tetris as an absolute package i feel should be portable
[1:20:00] <Sayie> I've never actually played tetris in my 24 years of life
[1:20:02] <worldbrand> I mean as much as I love TGM, where the fuck am I going to find a cabinet?
[1:20:08] <+sewermonk> tetris effect actually does happen
[1:20:08] <+teh_rawk> so blu mage
[1:20:09] <majestic_seven> My parents were shook when I showed them this game
[1:20:11] <kvnmck94> that soumds like some tetris fart sniffin shit
[1:20:16] <+PeaceCentennial> Woolie is going big
[1:20:17] <Sol_Install> damn it woolie

[1:21:44] <+superorangerobin> The craziest thing about the Tetris Effect is that people with anteirograde amnesia experience it.
[1:21:45] <grenadier42> I still think TGM3 has a better soundtrack tbh
[1:21:48] <umbypokochan> Tetris should only be between a man and a woman
[1:21:49] <Sphincter_Spelunker> You need to correct Koichi's inside out sock. You. Need. To.

[1:49:51] <Nikbottom> Tetris is not sexy enough for even Zone
[1:49:52] <Applecannon63> Zone tan is focusing on porn
[1:49:52] <majesticpaladin> Is white girl music another way of saying Country music? SeemsGood
[1:49:54] <captainthunderwolf> Honestly, I'm really glad that Woolie is streaming now. The feedback in viewer overlap between him, Pat, Plague, Peach, Matt's and Liam's streams should be good for all of them.
[1:49:55] <DarkSurplex> Why are these aesthetics so good
[1:49:57] <dukenux> Do some tetromino art Zone

[3:31:48] <+LozsCat> i was a baby 18 years ago tho
[3:31:49] <+Maxthetics> i tried Rez on the Vive on your recommendation and couldn't really get into it. Gameplay seemed really unengaging. I dunno what I missed.

[3:34:12] <Orochi_Sheewa> oh god my motion sickness
[3:34:13] <Sphincter_Spelunker> If only Woolie had a greenscreen. The gif potential

[3:34:38] <BoxNavy> makes sense @jobbedbone
[3:34:40] <DigbyMayor> What is even happening
[3:34:43] <odd_slater> @Dovahthing It's a cross between a shoot em up and rhythm game
[3:34:51] <+mechslayer71> What is this LUL
[3:34:52] <+demonsamura> oh didn't think it worked by lights
[3:34:58] <Skullgod> let woolie stream what he wants
[3:35:01] <dukenux> this would give me a seizure so hard
[3:35:03] <+Toynota10> To those unaware, the Best Friends had a PSVR live stream and Woolie's reaction to Rez in VR is fucking priceless
[3:35:10] <+punpunshogun> Nero seems into it
[3:35:10] <+roxikat> He switched to Rez Infinite VR
[3:35:13] <Flare3500> Those gifs really needs to be fixed like put it on the lower left and make it smaller
[3:35:16] <smol_ravi> woolie being wholesome is perfect stream material
[3:35:18] <321Continue> @demonsamura almost rvery other vr headset doesnt, but the psvr does
[3:35:21] <yuribo26> @Toynota10 he killed half the stream with his head banging

[3:36:24] <blacksoap65> What song is this!?
[3:36:25] <skewerstar> Loving the notification gifs here!
[3:36:28] <+Toynota10> I'll always support them =D
[3:36:34] <+mechslayer71> @demonsamura ARE WE REALLY GONNA PRETEND THAT PEOPLE DONT KNOW ABOUT DMC?!?!
[3:36:36] <yuribo26> @blacksoap65 as the song suggests, fear is the mind killer
[3:36:39] <ultimatetotoro> weird question; anyone now if this is going on woolies channel later? i won't be able to watch this live
[3:36:39] <+demonsamura> im 26 and have never heard of this game xD
[3:36:45] <+roxikat> Fear Is The Mind Killer
[3:36:49] <blacksoap65> thanks!
[3:36:54] <IceySpy> I've heard people talk about it but never really looked into it
[3:36:55] <+Toynota10> @ultimatetotoro I'm sure he'll upload it there
[3:37:00] <odd_slater> LUL
[3:37:05] <Flare3500> Woolie breaks neck live on first stream
[3:37:08] <+NWR_James> @ultimatetotoro it will be in the twich archive regardless, at least for a bit
[3:37:16] <+Story_Ark> man Tetris effect sure is lacking Tetris
[3:37:16] <yuribo26> @ultimatetotoro I don't know, and if I recall non-partnered vods get deleted after couple weeks
[3:37:17] <juicedmeerkats> This game looks super cool, but I'm also about to vomit
[3:37:18] <+LozsCat> I was 14 months when this came out and it still looks great today
[3:37:21] <+demonsamura> ive heard of dmc not the game hes playing though
[3:37:25] <+mechslayer71> @flare3500 It’s a good way to go out, compared to the others
[3:37:26] <kaine_west> I remember watching a review of this game on the local Video game review TV show. Always thought it was sick
[3:37:43] <T_Sasquatch> i still dont know what im looking at
[3:37:43] <KahnWick> this reminds me of Amplitude on PS2 in a way.
[3:37:48] <BoxNavy> the baby vineBab ?
[3:37:51] <RunningNGunning> Oh that sample is from California Soul, thats where I recognize it LUL
[3:37:55] <ultimatetotoro> i thought the woolies old stuff was sub locked like the podcast?
[3:37:57] <yuribo26> I love how everytime Woolie pops rez with vr people start to vomit
[3:37:59] <+Toynota10> Wish there were clubs that just played video game music
[3:38:16] <+Menitta> The sounds remind me of that virtual world in Shadow the Hedgehog.
[3:38:17] <modmanawesome69> oh i just realized what game this was and also just realized that i've never seen gameplay of it
[3:38:19] <Flare3500> Just break your neck woolie , what's the deal
[3:38:20] <yuribo26> @ultimatetotoro this is the first stream of this channel
[3:38:22] <+runethomas> hey woolz!
[3:38:28] <Skullgod> woolies stuff cant be sub locked if people cant sub
[3:38:30] <solarenverse> mind is the fear killer
[3:38:30] <+demonsamura> i hate that the podcast is sub locked >.<
[3:38:30] <+mechslayer71> @demonsamura The joke is that woolie constantly does this thing where he assumes people know about his niche obscure shit. The DMC play through is just one such example
[3:38:30] <kaine_west> clubs are mostly wack and play some dumbass dubstep where i'm from
[3:38:32] <+Keyd00d> t-t-the mind K I L L E R
[3:38:33] <Skullgod> :thinking:
[3:38:39] <IceySpy> I feel like I may have seen this on G4 TV when that was a thing
[3:38:41] <ultimatetotoro> ooooh.
[3:38:44] <Sr901> I would like to be sold on this game but I cant understand what I'm viewing
[3:38:48] <Dovahthing> when did this come out?
[3:38:51] <A_d3adly_zambo> so woolie do like kirby ? nod for answer
[3:38:57] <solarenverse> this was on dreamcast
[3:38:57] <+LozsCat> nod
[3:38:58] <+demonsamura> oh, im behind on my woolie lore
[3:39:01] <yuribo26> @Dovahthing dreamcast
[3:39:15] <ultimatetotoro> ooooh...okay. thanks guys!
[3:39:18] <juicedmeerkats> The flying lotus position is rad
[3:39:21] <yuribo26> @Sr901 its like a shmup on rails mixed with rhytmn game
[3:39:27] <+Menitta> You mean like when Kevin Spacey says "Hey a PS Vita! I should get one for the car"
[3:39:27] <+Jake_Protagonist> Well if there was more like it wouldnt stand out as much
[3:39:33] <+captain_history> this is a known game, it's not super popular what it's known
[3:39:37] <+LozsCat> Hey how long is rez anyways?
[3:39:41] <buffmurffy> wireframes are awesome and do not get nearly enough play nowadays
[3:39:48] <cgame_me811> @dovahthing Originally on the PS 2
[3:39:53] <+Keyd00d> like 2 hours max
[3:39:54] <reonome> PUKE CITY
[3:39:56] <+bluetocho13> @demonsamura more lore will get added quicker now that woolie is streaming
[3:39:59] <+roxikat> If only TRON Legacy had performed.
[3:40:01] <solarenverse> @C_game_me_811 dreamcast, not ps2
[3:40:01] <JobbedBone> what does failure look like in this game?
[3:40:11] <JobbedBone> is he doing well?
[3:40:17] <+astropyrus> The Extended Best Friends Universe grows stronger and stronger with every stream
[3:40:19] <+mechslayer71> @jobbedbone It looks like a failure of game design Kappa
[3:40:30] <yuribo26> @jobbedbone aiming with the vr set makes the game super easy
[3:40:33] <+demonsamura> isn't this just asura's wrath?
[3:40:54] <Pnutz409> Is this Lawnmower Man 3?
[3:40:54] <+bluetocho13> but will lessen since Matt wont be streaming that often anymore
[3:40:58] <dukenux> THis is the most video game video game ive seen in a while
[3:40:58] <Mysf1t> What game is this? The stream still says Tetris.
[3:41:03] <reonome> rez
[3:41:04] <+LozsCat> Rez
[3:41:05] <Skullgod> Rez
[3:41:07] <+jjgamez64> @jobbedbone Failure looks like not as much poppin' beats and the player becomes a simple sphere

[3:41:23] <Cosairen> rez: woolie makes his stream vomit edition
[3:41:29] <yuribo26> @Cosairen LUL
[3:41:31] <solarenverse> @C_game_me_811 actually my bad, dc and ps2 were same day
[3:41:35] <IceySpy> Yeah, this definitely gives the impression of an obscure Dreamcast game
[3:41:40] <+demonsamura> woolies neck is going to be destoryed after this
[3:41:41] <+JoeStillLife> LUL
[3:41:43] <Flare3500> I like how the number of people watching is going down/maybe dying thanks to woolie
[3:41:46] <Pnutz409> ugh sorry gotta go. this is too much.
[3:41:47] <+mechslayer71> I really don’t se show this makes people vomit. Is motion sickness that real? LUL
[3:41:52] <wolfofsound> I only know of it thanks to woolie constantly talking about it
