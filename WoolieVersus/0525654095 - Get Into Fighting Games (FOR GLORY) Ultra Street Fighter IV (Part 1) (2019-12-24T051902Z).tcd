[0:30:47] <yeahthatalex> Woolie out here playing with beyblades
[0:30:53] <%Roasted_Pheasant> While I like SF3, I think SF4 is more fun at the scrub level. Thoughts?
[0:31:06] <%MayorRev> you can mod SF4 yea?
[0:31:10] <kaine_west> i think both are pretty fun
[0:31:12] <%gatorafan> Somewhat
[0:31:13] <+arknodem> Keep it up Reggie!
[0:31:19] <kaine_west> at a low-level
[0:31:25] <+NeoKable_> remember woolie vs daigo
[0:31:27] <%MayorRev> I've seen some mods for SF
[0:31:34] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Woolie is forever retired from SKULLGIRLS I imagine now LUL
[0:31:39] <fist_wizard_jay> Dont chokejerk Reggie
[0:31:39] <%gatorafan> Every now and then I like to run Remix
[0:31:41] <ittla> sf4 is my favorite street fighter game to just turn on and play with friends
[0:31:41] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Woolie DID almost get Daigo
[0:31:43] <yeahthatalex> I think I'd prefer to pick up and play IV, easier execution barrier and less lopsided cast.
[0:31:45] <Skatedeandre> whens SFxT? Kappa
[0:31:52] <+NeoKable_> ill never forget how close he was
[0:31:55] <ittla> it's a good time and that huge roster helps
[0:31:56] <yeahthatalex> And the super dishonest characters are more playable.
[0:32:07] <FuqBoiSlim> never forget the hyperthicc juri mod for this game
[0:32:14] <hntronium> Reggie's switch is getting flipped
[0:32:19] <Skatedeandre> juri Kreygasm
[0:32:20] <ittla> the costume mods for this game are embarassing
[0:32:23] <%MayorRev> it's in the ocean where Tom Cruise threw it :p @skatedeandre
[0:32:36] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Embarassing or Emboldening?
[0:32:38] <ittla> plus they're unnecessary because elena and sakura already have their best costumes
[0:32:40] <Skatedeandre> @mayorrev LUL good
[0:32:41] <%Th3SmartAlec> @ittla Like they're bad or?
[0:32:45] <artificiallynatural> why did I search up the juri mod
[0:32:49] <drastic_go_down> damn woolie would use that alt
[0:33:03] <%Roasted_Pheasant> @artificiallynatural Cause you knew you had to know
[0:33:03] <SnowLoch> is it just me, or is Ryu trying so hard.
[0:33:03] <ittla> there are some fun ones buried beneath the massive list of nude/bikini mods
[0:33:04] <%Th3SmartAlec> @artificiallynatural The real question is why hadn't you by now?
[0:33:08] <+arknodem> Ayyyyyyyy
[0:33:09] <%gatorafan> @ittla, really? I remember mostly being cool. Then again, the ammount of mods since the last time I tried probably increased a lot.
[0:33:12] <hntronium> Nice Reggie
[0:33:13] <DanielGames> Daigo beats Woolie in pools once again :(
[0:33:16] <Skatedeandre> no johns

[0:36:35] <TheArrow_> blanka player acting like he has a plan
[0:36:45] <Zayasu> atpRtsd
[0:36:48] <hoenhime344> i still say KI is the best modern fighting game ever created
[0:36:56] <+TopTieramisu> respecting with blanka atpCap
[0:37:08] <Solidnick18> LUL
[0:37:19] <@Solidus_113> Imagine a blanka player respecting others
[0:37:21] <%BallerSwagBro9k> REGGIE IS SLAYING TODAY
[0:37:21] <fist_wizard_jay> Chokejerking with Blanka
[0:37:24] <preppyposs> this looks way faster than SFV
[0:37:26] <hntronium> respect the reggie
[0:37:32] <%wiseblade1> characters like Fuerte and Blanka fight against the opposing player rather than the character.
[0:37:32] <+CampinSteve> @preppyposs its not
[0:37:39] <+CampinSteve> the animations are just bad
[0:37:43] <FuqBoiSlim> what reason would a blanka player need to respect people?? you're already disrespecting them just by picking blanka
[0:37:47] <%NovaKnightmare> Do not shake hands with blank players
[0:37:49] <%gatorafan> You hold back then forward and punch
[0:37:55] <+Ryu_R> you mean like potemkin? Kappa
[0:37:57] <%lilo52> "hold back" pretty much LUL
[0:38:03] <coreybom> @preppyposs It LOOKS faster, but it's actually quite slower. Least for most characters.
[0:38:06] <stranger59> BALLS EXPOSED
[0:38:09] <%MayorRev> just hold down back 4Head
[0:38:10] <preppyposs> what makes eople say the animations are bad
[0:38:10] <%wiseblade1> you have to get in their head and make the unsafe stuff work.
[0:38:15] <brunoberserk> go reggie
[0:38:18] <GoldeNOVA> Daaamn Reggie PogChamp
[0:38:23] <King_Kth> who greenlit the reggie buffs in the last patch? :O
[0:38:37] <+rednecked__crake> always blacklist blanka players
[0:38:48] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Quick make Reggie comfy! Talk about feet!
[0:38:52] <FuqBoiSlim> @preppyposs cuz they're super snappy I guess but if they were too fluid it would be kinda hard to read em
[0:38:52] <%gatorafan> This is the old game, before all the Reggie nerfs happened. daedra1CryingTibs
[0:39:11] <+sinistersally> no combo
[0:39:15] <+rednecked__crake> yes combo
[0:39:15] <+TopTieramisu> TRUE COMBO
[0:39:19] <Solidnick18> do combo
[0:39:19] <fist_wizard_jay> but no combooo
[0:39:21] <%CaptainPileDriver> why you no combo..
[0:39:22] <+sinistersally> oh... combo
[0:39:23] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I know nothing of SF. What's wrong with Blanka players?
[0:39:23] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Neither woolie nor blanka wears shoes
[0:39:32] <coreybom> @preppyposs Their not as fully formed, far less fluid and more snappy. Like it's just two frames mixed together.
[0:39:34] <+rednecked__crake> blanka is degenerate
[0:39:37] <fist_wizard_jay> ok but
[0:39:43] <fist_wizard_jay> Ryu doesnt wear shoes either

[0:44:26] <ChrisAlgoo> um,
[0:44:32] <yeahthatalex> Nah, he's most likely based on a character from an obscure Kungfu movie called Master of the Flying Guillotine.
[0:44:37] <+Grayhammatter> yoga FLAME
[0:44:38] <ChrisM341> Aw He Dead
[0:44:40] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Oh jesus
[0:44:49] <+Cymen90> @coreybom Oh yeah, Street Fighter really needs subtle acting.
[0:44:54] <StarkMaximum> Yeah I do liek the exagerrated style of SFIV. SFV is fine but I think this game straddles realism and cartoony better
[0:45:06] <+Grayhammatter> oof
[0:45:14] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @fist_wizard_jay
[0:45:18] <%BallerSwagBro9k> As someone who can't play fighting games whatsoever these 2 are godlike at,this game
[0:45:21] <+arknodem> I had no clue that snuffed up ball
[0:45:31] <ittla> i feel like this game just feels way better than 5
[0:45:33] <%wolfofsound> more like get into woolie's ass
[0:45:36] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Yo maybe I shoulda played Dhalsim
[0:45:41] <ittla> i really dislike the weird pause on every hit in 5
[0:45:45] <ittla> weird hitstop
[0:45:51] <HanPaul> still repping that ugly-ass costume atoCao
[0:46:03] <%wiseblade1> why is Woolie jumping against the character with like 6 different anti - airs?
[0:46:10] <Nerdwarp112> Something about the lighting or something makes me not like SF4 as much as SF5 visually. I understand the appeal of 4, but 5 looks mostly prettier to me.

[0:46:26] <FuqBoiSlim> it's all he knows
[0:46:28] <+arknodem> I thought Sim was higher tier in SF4? Is it a USF4 thing?
[0:46:30] <hoenhime344> WTF
[0:46:33] <hoenhime344> what was that?
[0:46:34] <ittla> 5 is a better looking game but 4 has a better style

[0:53:28] <%wiseblade1> TFW when you opponent can't even mash right
[0:53:31] <CaptainUseless> I think super was the best version of SF4.
[0:53:37] <%CaptainPileDriver> god there was so many elena and evil ryu's that capcom cup
[0:53:38] <CaptainUseless> Red focus is silly.
[0:53:51] <%wiseblade1> @captainuseless YOU'RE CRAZY
[0:53:59] <+TopTieramisu> blacksad ryu
[0:54:10] <+mighty_max_t> My biggest problem with USF4 is Sakura's air tatsu distance nerf

[0:54:16] <FuqBoiSlim> Sleep Fighter x Kekken ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[0:54:18] <%wiseblade1> SSFIV Cammy, Rose and Fei were obscene.
[0:54:22] <yeahthatalex> Never forget, Kazunoko played Yun because he didn't want to play footsies and won Capcup.
[0:54:45] <+TopTieramisu> kazunoko prevented the blessed daigo run NotLikeThis
[0:54:48] <HumBao> !uptime
[0:54:48] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 1 minute
[0:54:53] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Wait....did Ryu become evil? Or is this a clone or something?
[0:54:54] <CaptainUseless> That's fair, but there's always those characters in any version of the game: Vanilla Sagat, AE Twins, USF4 Elena etc.
[0:55:10] <%stupidsquid> can i like fighting games and not know shit about terminology?
[0:55:19] <+TopTieramisu> also, kazunoko also avoided all of his demons in his capcom cup run
[0:55:22] <+TekkenPlayer> i think it's netease
[0:55:22] <CaptainUseless> I liked Super because of good charge characters, balanced Sagat, and no silly red focus.
[0:55:25] <%wiseblade1> USFIV Elena isn't nearly as oppressive as the others.
[0:55:33] <+TopTieramisu> also also also
[0:55:40] <candidateplays> Mmmmm.... Vanilla Sagat
[0:55:46] <Nerdwarp112> @ballerswagbro9k I think this is like an alternate version of Ryu where he gives in to the Satsui no Hado
[0:56:00] <GoldeNOVA> @WoolieVersus Dude's mic is low, or game audio is ver high
[0:56:00] <+chaumiester> Why is Evil Ryu a furry?
[0:56:01] <+absolutenc> BORK
[0:56:04] <+mighty_max_t> The Vanilla Sagat ice cream cone mod is the best though
[0:56:09] <%wiseblade1> vanilla Sagat/Akuma, Super Cammy/Fei and the AE twins are leagues tougher than Ultra Elena.
[0:56:09] <@Maximilian_DOOD> Capcom got a MUCH better deal than SNK did in that deal. They did not end that relationship on good terms.

[1:02:35] <coreybom> @indoorsitup Fear of being sued.
[1:02:38] <fist_wizard_jay> retconning/changing names like that would be too wierd imo
[1:02:46] <Nerdwarp112> I really wish people did more creative things with sumo characters, because I think sumo is really cool, but almost all of the sumo characters I can think of (except for Hinako from KOF) are too similar design-wise.
[1:02:48] <kaine_west> Mike Ross got top 8 at Tekken and GG at Canada Cup LUL Kappa

[1:03:14] <IndoorSitup> @coreybom I don't think Tyson would give that much of a shit.
[1:03:20] <ChrisM341> I think My favorite Cammy Alt was her costume swap from Cross Tekken where she dressed up as King
[1:03:21] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1201765677977231360?s=19
[1:03:23] <+TopTieramisu> Waxl is the DIO to Mike Ross's Dio Brando
[1:03:40] <%Th3SmartAlec> @TopTieramisu Who's Diego then?
[1:03:41] <coreybom> @indoorsitup True, but by this point, what's the point.
[1:03:44] <FuqBoiSlim> Mike ross and MIKE
[1:03:46] <+TopTieramisu> he was buried by capcom, but resurrected and lives in the land of anime fighters
[1:03:54] <%wiseblade1> you'd be surprised what people decide to care about once money gets involved.
[1:03:59] <+mighty_max_t> My fav Cammy costume is the summer costume in SF4, with the leather jacket

[1:04:30] <ChrisM341> @mightymaxt I'll have to look that one up, didn't play much of this game
[1:04:30] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Kreygasm
[1:04:33] <itzDerrio> Not graphically though
[1:04:36] <+mighty_max_t> I mean, Streetwise Cammy is also a GREAT look
[1:04:38] <%Roasted_Pheasant> @TopTieramisu My guy
[1:04:49] <%CaptainPileDriver> @bloody_billz that's because half the roster was sent out to random people to make models so they all look fine
[1:04:51] <ChrisM341> I like Streetwise Guy's outfit a tiny bit
[1:04:58] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Them chunky gloves with the leotard. MMPH

[1:05:18] <%CaptainPileDriver> correction
[1:05:18] <coreybom> @indoorsitup Ehh, when the casual crowd only knows dictator by m.bison, it'll be even more confusing if they switched it back to Vega.
[1:05:19] <%CaptainPileDriver> wasn't
[1:05:23] <eldragon_1> Doll Cammy was best Cammy
[1:05:26] <%CaptainPileDriver> that's what happened to the sfv cast
[1:05:33] <%CaptainPileDriver> which is why ken looks like shit
[1:05:47] <IndoorSitup> I can't be the only one who hates the way characters look in this game, right?
[1:05:53] <+TopTieramisu> sfv ken atpRtsd
[1:05:55] <ChrisM341> I like Ken's Default, I hate his alt with the very short hair
[1:06:12] <Mysidian_Maestro> Through the Wing!
[1:06:17] <%CaptainPileDriver> idk, in this game they look consistant compared tosfv
[1:06:17] <FuqBoiSlim> Banana Hair Ken woolieDATTEBAYO
[1:06:18] <Novillion> it's a goofy artstyle, a lot of people hated it when sf4 came out
[1:06:19] <+Ryu_R> just cut out the middleman and shave Ken's head
[1:06:20] <+Grayhammatter> through the plane LUL
[1:06:23] <itzDerrio> I mean it looks better in general
[1:06:24] <Nerdwarp112> @indoorsitup I feel a similar way. A lot of the faces look weird to me.
[1:06:40] <+TopTieramisu> capcom isn't ready to handle dreads
[1:06:46] <%CaptainPileDriver> legit i do think this game looks better overall
[1:06:50] <%wiseblade1> heavy can be punished by a lot on reversal timing.
[1:06:50] <+TopTieramisu> necalli's hair does not work
[1:06:53] <ChrisM341> I like how the artstyle looks in this game better than SFXT
[1:07:07] <+mighty_max_t> At least Sakura's redesign is really good
[1:07:18] <GoldeNOVA> The artstyle in SFxT looks bad
[1:07:23] <Nerdwarp112> @chrism341 everyone looks super orangey in SFxT
[1:07:23] <roada_rolla_da> The colors in SFxT were so saturated, it hurt to look at
[1:07:31] <+TopTieramisu> SFxT's cinematics tho
[1:07:33] <+TopTieramisu> those were awesome
[1:07:45] <LordGreenwoods> The last time I have fun playing with Ken was in CVS2, after that, Ken was boring for me....
[1:07:48] <+SON0ROUS> nice dood3S
[1:07:50] <ChrisM341> I still enjoyed the game but when I went back to try sf4 I noticed how much the art quality dropped in sfxt
[1:07:53] <kaine_west> if only it were as good as thr actual game
[1:07:54] <coreybom> @captainpiledriver Ehh, personally I think some parts are a bit dated.

[1:09:06] <+SON0ROUS> Yomi~
[1:09:10] <ChrisM341> I like 4 and 5's look about the same
[1:09:12] <floralkami> Oh shit, this is straight up a new game
[1:09:14] <ChrisAlgoo> furry Cammy is good
[1:09:17] <+SON0ROUS> atpQuan atpQuan atpQuan
[1:09:24] <fuji_92> Getting mixed PogChamp
[1:09:29] <%wiseblade1> yeah, Cammy is SUCH a terrible character...
[1:09:33] <%CaptainPileDriver> some of usf4 is dated but god sfv is ugly overall
[1:09:33] <itzDerrio> I hate how they made juri fireballs black n white wtf
[1:09:34] <floralkami> I ain't even realize till i saw the new gauge
[1:09:41] <+TopTieramisu> let's be honest, sf4's models have not aged well at all
[1:09:41] <Billyuppercut0> WoolieVersus is getting bullied
[1:09:48] <+TopTieramisu> look at sf4 chun
[1:09:50] <+mighty_max_t> Juri's SF5 design isn't bad, per say, but her original design is PERFECT
[1:09:52] <Nerdwarp112> @toptieramisu I think Juri’s face looks a lot better in SFV
[1:09:57] <floralkami> @TopTieramisu glad I'm not the only one
[1:10:00] <%jinking79> i started from Alpha return cause of sf4 ended on 3rd strike
[1:10:00] <+TopTieramisu> @Nerdwarp112 i meant her gameplay
[1:10:11] <%CaptainPileDriver> well @MightyMaxT it was just Jolyne from part 6 that's why
[1:10:24] <floralkami> Oh, this is IV.......
[1:10:24] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:10:29] <hntronium> LET CAMMY'S FEET EMPOWER YOU REGGIE
[1:10:33] <itzDerrio> Sfv has better graphics but sf4 has better artstyle and gameplay imo
[1:10:35] <LordGreenwoods> @MightyMaxT true SF4 Juri is better and more fun
[1:10:39] <%CaptainPileDriver> yeah but then look at ken, karin and the fucking hand to head ratio in this game
[1:10:40] <coreybom> @captainpiledriver Come on, there's alot of good looking stuff in SFV. animations as a whole look far more fluid.
[1:10:47] <floralkami> Fuck, does this not look Kansas different than V
[1:10:51] <+mighty_max_t> @CaptainPileDriver Fair enough, but the baggy pants are also great and add a lot
[1:10:53] <Nerdwarp112> @toptieramisu oh yeah I forget about the changes since I don’t play her as much
[1:10:54] <IndoorSitup> Have they fucked up the wing yet?
[1:11:00] <floralkami> *look any
[1:11:02] <coreybom> @captainpiledriver I think Karin looks fine.
[1:11:11] <fuji_92> Damn
[1:11:20] <%wiseblade1> I still love looking at SFIV links, all these years later.
[1:11:25] <+TopTieramisu> i think some characters look good in sfv and some don't work at all
[1:11:36] <+TopTieramisu> vega should be longer and more elegant, but he's as stocky as every other dude
[1:11:45] <+TopTieramisu> and why is ed another big buff dude?
[1:11:46] <%CaptainPileDriver> the pants don't bother me, but look at how fucking HUGE some of the casts hands are, and some of the weird faces, i think usf4 generally looks better model wise
[1:11:49] <hntronium> SAFETY, more like COWARDICE
[1:11:52] <%Th3SmartAlec> Hmm?
[1:11:57] <+Grayhammatter> uh...
[1:11:59] <ChrisM341> The only character I have a problem with in V is Ed, his animations look stiff in my opinion
[1:12:00] <%Roasted_Pheasant> cmonBruh
[1:12:00] <itzDerrio> Dhalism is too buff too
[1:12:01] <+vaporousTippler> Dangerously close to Max moment.
[1:12:04] <%BallerSwagBro9k> cmonBruh cmonBruh cmonBruh cmonBruh

[1:12:08] <RadShiro> Woolie tries to play safe? Thats DUMB. YOU NEED TO GO FULL DUMB
[1:12:08] <Nerdwarp112> @toptieramisu I wish they kept Ed with his original story design

[1:12:18] <+TopTieramisu> @Nerdwarp112 yes. add some variety to the lineup
[1:12:21] <FuqBoiSlim> ninja dagger???
[1:12:26] <itzDerrio> @chris u must hate mortal kombat then
[1:12:28] <+Ryu_R> @Stofil42 lmao
[1:12:28] <coreybom> Honestly, I really don't like how the muscles looking this one. especially on the shotos.
[1:12:31] <hntronium> Woolie, you know you promised to never stop going in
[1:12:31] <Novillion> I'm so upset they roided out Ed, need a slim dude in sf
[1:12:35] <+mighty_max_t> I also wish Death-By-Chip was back. It adds a sense of urgency that I miss
[1:12:38] <FuqBoiSlim> Daggers is our word you can say Dagga tho
[1:12:40] <IndoorSitup> I wish they would just go back to the anime artstyle they had going on in SF3 and Alpha.
[1:12:44] <+Polter_ge1st> ABORT
[1:12:49] <Nerdwarp112> At least G is pretty cool
[1:13:06] <Pistachius> @novillion Fang KEKW
[1:13:08] <+TopTieramisu> just license sf6 to arcsys LUL
[1:13:12] <+Uulyaoth> sf4 ? ew

[1:13:18] <+TopTieramisu> one can only dream
[1:13:24] <%wiseblade1> @indoorsitup and directly compete with ASW? That's a fight Capcom can't win.
[1:13:29] <ChrisM341> @bloody_billz I like Mk a lot

[1:14:05] <coreybom> no Kappa
[1:14:05] <+TopTieramisu> i think menat is gonna be the character that will survive sfv, like juri was with sf4
[1:14:07] <hntronium> Cammy Reggie Fighting
[1:14:07] <%CaptainPileDriver> @Billyuppercut0 no
[1:14:12] <NotHereToStream> I wonder what SF would look like in the hands of arcsys
[1:14:16] <itzDerrio> Everyones good in Sf4
[1:14:20] <%CaptainPileDriver> snakeeyez is just fucking amazing
[1:14:24] <Kalinflip> @NotHereToStream like an arcysys game atpCap
[1:14:27] <Kalinflip> Jebaited
[1:14:37] <Solidnick18> lol
[1:14:45] <+SON0ROUS> MiniK where's your motivation?
[1:14:46] <Billyuppercut0> Zangeif is my spirt animal
[1:14:49] <+TopTieramisu> i miss sf4 snakeeyez
[1:14:55] <%jinking79> doodSsapo
[1:14:56] <Solidnick18> watch those toes
[1:15:13] <Kalinflip> Proximity normals Kreygasm
[1:15:24] <ChrisM341> I wonder what all the ground crew is thinking while watching this fight
[1:15:26] <%CaptainPileDriver> yeah, i miss sf4 gief, i miss greenhand
[1:15:36] <IndoorSitup> My hope is that one day they would try to replicate the way characters looked in SF3 and Alpha. Anime artstyle works well with Street Fighter.
[1:15:37] <Pistachius> guile had some pretty cool technical combos in 4. loved doing them
[1:15:46] <itzDerrio> Bro ultras look better in this too
[1:15:51] <Kalinflip> hondas armor break move is to good to get hit by set ups like that
[1:15:59] <hntronium> God, straddle by Cammy
[1:15:59] <+TopTieramisu> maybe if arcsys got their hands on it
[1:16:02] <ChrisM341> Dudley
[1:16:09] <+TopTieramisu> i doubt capcom has worked towards that artstyle at all
[1:16:11] <hntronium> DUDDERS
[1:16:12] <roada_rolla_da> I do wonder how SF6 will look like, if they'll make it more stylized or more realistic
[1:16:13] <+mighty_max_t> HERE WE GO
[1:16:19] <+TopTieramisu> if anything, all the characters will look like the RE remakes
[1:16:21] <Solidnick18> protect those skies
[1:16:22] <fist_wizard_jay> FOR GLORY
[1:16:22] <LordGreenwoods> @NotHereToStream almost happen before, they were suppose to make a Sammy(Arc Sys at that time) Vs Capcom but the game was cancel
[1:16:33] <itzDerrio> Realistic SF would be ugly af
[1:16:35] <Billyuppercut0> YO my boy
[1:16:39] <IndoorSitup> @roada_rolla_da Probably photorealistic with the RE engine lol
[1:16:39] <kaine_west> learning Juri Kreygasm
[1:16:43] <%jinking79> just like the anime movie
[1:16:48] <Kalinflip> I hope sf6 goes back to 2 D sprites
[1:16:56] <+TopTieramisu> yeah, that won't happen
[1:16:56] <+SON0ROUS> KappaPride
[1:17:01] <Billyuppercut0> Time for some big MEATY throws
[1:17:07] <ChrisM341> HEAT AND HAZE INTENSIFIES
[1:17:07] <+TopTieramisu> 2D takes way too much time and effort
[1:17:09] <roada_rolla_da> If they went realistic, I'd hope they make it like what Akuma looks like in Tekken 7
[1:17:09] <Stofil42> the goggles do nothing
[1:17:21] <Kalinflip> @TopTieramisu A man can dream cant he atpCap
[1:17:21] <+TopTieramisu> more than capcom is willing to put in

[1:17:37] <Kalinflip> bitch :)
[1:17:48] <+TopTieramisu> @Kalinflip atpMurray
[1:17:49] <+Ryu_R> the realistic look is most definitely gonna be more like RE2/DMC5
[1:17:53] <itzDerrio> Realistic would mean realistic proportions
[1:17:55] <+mighty_max_t> Tekken & MK have the market on realism, I hope they pick an art style and lean into it
[1:18:03] <Kalinflip> @TopTieramisu atpLaw2 keep it down atpSuspect
[1:18:05] <fuji_92> Mother Russia cries tonight BibleThump
[1:18:08] <itzDerrio> Chun li would be less thick
[1:18:08] <%jinking79> god this game more hype to watch than sfv still
[1:18:13] <+saladin1911> Wow yeah
[1:18:13] <+cheezy_snackz> why hasen't greenhand been put into sfv as a v skill or trigger yet
[1:18:16] <Billyuppercut0> Zangief plz TearGlove
[1:18:18] <%Irridium> they should go all-in on that watercolor artstyle the first SFIV teaser had
[1:18:21] <+TopTieramisu> atp1000
[1:18:23] <ChrisM341> I kinda want the RE remakes to go up to 4 but I' scared of what they might remove from the game
[1:18:24] <+saladin1911> Imagine SF6 in the RE engine
[1:18:26] <itzDerrio> Zangief would be smaller
[1:18:28] <NotHereToStream> @LordGreenwoods thats a shame, would of been nice to see what the end product would look like

[1:21:11] <Nekros4442> @TopTieramisu There were a season's worth of characters that were going to be doled out as dlc that were already finished and on the actual CD

[1:22:29] <ChrisAlgoo> *best friends voice* Street fighter 5! STREET FIGHTER 5!
[1:22:35] <ChrisM341> I think Bob was the only Tekken Character I learned in that game. (But also picked up Chun-li Guile and Sagat in that game)
[1:22:51] <+saladin1911> @coreybom You're right but if they remade it, I reckon they would mainly try to adjust the tone of the game to be more serious but like, that defeats what makes RE4 so great.
[1:23:00] <+TopTieramisu> i want to see what tekken characters would play like in a GG x Tekken
[1:23:18] <ChrisM341> I wanna see how they would retcon re5 and 6
[1:23:23] <+mighty_max_t> Jin, Bryan and Hwoarang were a lot of fun for me
[1:23:33] <itzDerrio> What if they made a crossover of all fighters

[1:24:21] <coreybom> @saladin1911 True, and most likely put everything in the re engine. Also, while the tone of RE4 is beloved, let's not act like it was also what kinda screwed resident evil for a good long while.

[1:25:38] <+TopTieramisu> they're improving their visuals, but it should look really good for that crossover
[1:25:38] <+saladin1911> @coreybom Oh yeah absolutely. It suplex'd the series into the dirt by being such a wild change but also near perfect

[1:28:15] <coreybom> @saladin1911 I have faith Capcom will do it justice if it was remade. I mean as dark as remake 2 was, it did it's silly moments well.

[1:29:53] <+saladin1911> @coreybom It would most likely be good but it would have to be completely different. I'd rather they just give us RE8 tho.

[1:30:34] <Kalinflip> @jacob2pop atpRtsd
[1:30:41] <ChrisM341> If they remake RE4 I want Leon and Krauser's story from Darkside Chronicles to be a chapter in the game
[1:30:42] <jacob2pop> what do you think that boxing training was for
[1:30:44] <vaporsnake007> So have they mentioned which they like better overall between Street Fighter 4 & 5?
[1:30:54] <+TopTieramisu> are we watching a live match or did woolie get hit by Gold Experience Requiem?
[1:31:07] <+TopTieramisu> you will never arrive at the win
[1:31:08] <itzDerrio> They said 4 of course
[1:31:12] <+saladin1911> @toptieramisu REmake: Revelations when? LUL

[1:32:46] <+saladin1911> @coreybom Who caused the BS of RE7 again?
[1:32:53] <itzDerrio> When is it ever for fun
[1:32:55] <vaporsnake007> @bloody_billz Interesting cause it seems like Maximillian Dood is slso feeling SF4 over 5
[1:33:13] <+Zero_ELEC> skullgrils was For Fun @bloody_billz
[1:33:20] <jacob2pop> @vaporsnake007 I think the world felt that way

[1:35:08] <anuchallengertwitch> I will forever be grateful that sf4 introduced Juri
[1:35:13] <LordGreenwoods> SF3 is still the best for me dood3S

[1:35:28] <%ElectricEmissary> is it the scar
[1:35:29] <+gl0vesup7> Cold Take: sf4 looks LIGHT YEARS better than sf5
[1:35:32] <vaporsnake007> OK then I'm going to buy UltraSF4 on PS4 instead of SFV Champion!

[1:36:53] <+SkaiVibration> OK
[1:36:56] <DrkJP520> Console? PC?
[1:37:05] <IndoorSitup> Makoto's voice just reminded me how much I don't like this game's English dub.
[1:37:07] <ChrisM341> This is like one of my Japanese Hentais
[1:37:15] <coreybom> @bloody_billz Okay let's not get crazy. SFV is not great, but sfiv is pretty bad.
[1:37:23] <+gl0vesup7> @coreybom Idk man, those sf5 models still look rough
[1:37:24] <itzDerrio> Nah
[1:37:28] <+TopTieramisu> makoto fans shouldn't despair she isn't in v. be happy she wasn't butchered
[1:37:47] <vaporsnake007> @bloody_billz Does SF4 really have better online for real?
[1:37:50] <@Menitta> No I want her in 5 tho
[1:37:56] <+mighty_max_t> SF4 allowing you to choose the VO per character was a stroke of genius, glad SF5 has that too
[1:38:02] <itzDerrio> Sfv has slow loading times and teleporting frames
[1:38:11] <nawleenspoboy> boi you no ready
[1:38:13] <%Irridium> every fighting game should let you choose their voices on a per-character basis
[1:38:19] <LordGreenwoods> they butchered Juri and Karin (Rekka lock behind V-Trigger)

[1:38:39] <itzDerrio> Yea vapor sf4 online is better
[1:38:40] <TaylorTot> I dont want her in 5 because they are gonna butcher her and take out all the fun stuff
[1:38:45] <%Irridium> @TopTieramisu that's a good one too

[1:39:05] <eldragon_1> Karin is OP anyway. But it hurts me how weak Juri is

[1:52:25] <itsgundamu> still don't get what the hell plinking is
[1:52:31] <BLVCKHEART> sfv was too easy execution wise and that kills it for me
[1:52:56] <itzDerrio> I hate that its slower and ex cancels gone too
[1:53:30] <ChrisM341> I forgot whose video it was but in SFV they replicated the Daigo parry and all you hated to do was mash instead of having it perfectly timed.
[1:53:31] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:53:43] <itzDerrio> I cant even play the full game of sfv though even though i paid 60
[1:54:04] <itzDerrio> Most stages and characters = locked
[1:54:17] <itsgundamu> @ChrisM341 It was Core A gaming video on if making fighting games easier is better or not
[1:54:31] <%CaptainPileDriver> @Irridium yo i'm gonna switch to hakan after this one
[1:54:32] <@Solidus_113> which version of SFV did you get
[1:54:37] <%hypotheticow> Has Cody Always been a Furry?
[1:54:39] <ChrisM341> @itsagundamu Thanks. That part of the video was funny
[1:54:55] <itzDerrio> The og 2016 one, ive been had it
[1:55:00] <itsgundamu> yea I honestly didn't believe it when I first saw it
[1:55:05] <itzDerrio> They ripped me off
[1:55:08] <@Solidus_113> you got fooled
[1:55:11] <@Solidus_113> real bad
[1:55:22] <Arek_1> @BLVCKHEART I appreciate SFV for it's focus on paying attention to learn about reaction to whiffs (like determining that a whiff punish is, perhaps, a 20 frame reaction (oh, I got that)) and okizeme (knockdown game).
[1:55:26] <ChrisM341> Did Ja Rule Sell you that copy of SFV?
[1:55:27] <itzDerrio> I know it pisses me off
[1:55:35] <mr_miyagucci> in this game you had to buy extra versions to get new characters so its really not different just you get the balance at least @bloody_billz
[1:55:40] <itzDerrio> I got it digitally
[1:56:10] <%hypotheticow> SFV: Fire Festival Ultra
[1:56:15] <itzDerrio> Its is tho, my first sf was SSF4 and everything was unlocked
[1:56:19] <ChrisM341> But the early version of the game lacked most of the dlc/an arcade mode
[1:56:22] <+saladin1911> @chrism341 Ja Rule would have sent you an empty case even when you bought it digitally LUL
[1:56:29] <itzDerrio> I get sfv, everything locked
[1:56:35] <Daxalog> Ive always disliked those flames shooting out of the side of the super meter. Looks tacky
[1:56:42] <DHBoi> the chains are so graining on the eyes when there is two of em
[1:56:43] <%Irridium> @CaptainPileDriver aight
[1:56:47] <@Solidus_113> There was 3 season passes of characters in SFV
[1:56:47] <ChrisM341> @saladin1911 XDD
[1:56:49] <DHBoi> ears*
[1:56:55] <SpodFish> THE EARS
[1:56:58] <mr_miyagucci> @bloody_billz thats because ssf4 was one of those newer versions vanilla had way fewer characters
[1:57:05] <%CaptainPileDriver> this juri is honestly still the best design and most fun to play
[1:57:13] <mr_miyagucci> you effectively bought vanilla
[1:57:28] <ChrisM341> @saladin1911 we laugh but I heard that's a thing now, buy a game case with a digital code inside to download
[1:57:37] <itzDerrio> Ok, then can u tell me why i got sfv arcade for free but things was still locked
[1:57:39] <Arek_1> Oh, and look. No combo hit counter is displayed until AFTER you finish or drop your combo.
[1:57:40] <+NicholasInfante92> hi woolie
[1:57:42] <mr_miyagucci> however getting it for 60 dollars a year after it came out is messed but I think thats just steam
[1:57:43] <Solidnick18> bingo
[1:57:45] <sparkly_yoyo> shitty jpeg flames
[1:57:51] <sparkly_yoyo> it's hilarious
[1:57:52] <critfumble_> god sf4 juri is what dreams are made of
[1:58:08] <Arek_1> @bloody_billz Trial version?
[1:58:10] <SpodFish> Ok but the get into fighting game shirts thooooo?
[1:58:16] <fuji_92> Juri Kreygasm
[1:58:17] <itzDerrio> No, i got it for 60 the year it came out
[1:58:28] <+saladin1911> @chrism341 I'm not even surprised. That sounds like an eBay thing tbh
[1:58:36] <itzDerrio> Not trial, no. Full
[1:58:38] <%hypotheticow> @ChrisM341 Back when i worked at gamestop, the last couple years they bothered to send us new Physical PC games, they were just cardboard boxes with Serial codes printed on the inside. Shit was dumb.
[1:58:45] <ChrisM341> I think it was Gamestop? I could be wrong
[1:58:45] <mr_miyagucci> @bloody_billz sfv updates the balance changes into the game and sells the characters rather than sf4 selling a new game everytime characters are added so you get system changes and whatnot just no characters because you did not buy them
[1:59:21] <ChrisM341> @hypotheticow Oh? Thanks for the confirmation, and yeah that does sound dumb
[1:59:22] <Arek_1> @bloody_billz Yeah, naturally the balance update came for free. You still have to buy characters, stages, and costumes and such.
[1:59:28] <itzDerrio> So what the hell was the 60 price tag for then
[1:59:31] <+saladin1911> @hypotheticow Holy shit that's some lazy crap lmfao. Welp, GameStop sure are doing great now...
[1:59:38] <+gl0vesup7> I still think the lack of arcade mode on release was a travesty
[1:59:49] <mr_miyagucci> imagine if from SSf4 came with the balance and system of ultra but not the characters
[2:00:17] <Arek_1> @bloody_billz The base game. The privelage of playing the game early in it's life and heyday.
[2:00:26] <itzDerrio> So a beta
[2:00:36] <itzDerrio> Capcom hoed me
[2:00:37] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:00:52] <%hypotheticow> @saladin1911 At least at that point, most of the store was still filled with video games and not Minecraft plushies.
[2:00:52] <ChrisM341> !MOTIVATED
[2:00:52] <@Moobot> 523 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[2:01:00] <mr_miyagucci> basically sfv's system was a way to prevent the player base from being fractured when they update
[2:01:04] <@Solidus_113> Such is buying most fighting games on release
[2:01:08] <Daxalog> I want to download Teppen but my phone literally dosnt have the space to hold it. Cest La Vie
[2:01:17] <%CaptainPileDriver> @Irridium lol, they starting
[2:01:26] <%CaptainPileDriver> ENDLESS BATTLE 1/2
[2:01:32] <%Irridium> @CaptainPileDriver fair enough ggs man

[2:01:47] <%CaptainPileDriver> gg @Irridium
[2:01:47] <ChrisM341> SOMEBODYS GETTING FUUUCKED
[2:01:48] <MahoganyWoods> The sfv model was better on the surface. It did absolutely release in an unacceptable state tho.
[2:01:53] <%CaptainPileDriver> sure
[2:02:01] <mr_miyagucci> SFV launch was shit
[2:02:01] <fuji_92> ight lets see
[2:02:04] <itzDerrio> Even BASE SF4 had more available than BASE sfv
[2:02:19] <mr_miyagucci> but I do like some aspects of how its monetized
[2:02:23] <itzDerrio> They shouldnt have charged full price
[2:02:26] <%yeknomlive> man I'm getting excellent adventures flashbacks
[2:02:34] <Solidnick18> lol
[2:02:36] <SomersaultJustice> is this ps4?
[2:02:42] <critfumble_> atv is a series of piss taking decisions made in boardrooms that stained a genuinely good project imo
[2:02:43] <Zayasu> yes
[2:02:43] <Solidnick18> yes
[2:02:46] <eldragon_1> yeah PS4

[2:29:48] <sneeze1991> this game didn't need another zoner
[2:29:51] <Nerdwarp112> The only thing I don’t like about 5’s design for Poison is her victory pose face
[2:29:51] <ittla> short hair poison should be a good thing
[2:29:54] <+solzan2000> if you going by looks SFV easy
[2:29:57] <%CaptainPileDriver> oh yeah, someone pick T-hawk and just CONDOR DIVE
[2:29:58] <ittla> the 2d art is very very good
[2:29:58] <Arek_1> SFIV Vega. <3
[2:29:59] <@Menitta> I can appreciate turning her into Whip.
[2:30:10] <TheArrow_> sfv ken looks good on paper too imo

[2:32:30] <ChrisM341> Everyone keeps forgetting the short haired Ken Alt in V that Made Max go silent when rating costumes
[2:32:39] <Nerdwarp112> I think the main problem with Ken in SFV is his face. That’s the only thing that bothers me personally.
[2:32:41] <+gl0vesup7> ^
[2:32:43] <itzDerrio> Sf4 does have bad lighting
[2:32:58] <+solzan2000> short hair ken is soooo bad
[2:32:58] <+gl0vesup7> The art style in 4 is fantastic tho
[2:33:00] <Novillion> that and his locks cut through his shoulder
[2:33:05] <itzDerrio> And kens teeth are gross too
[2:33:08] <Nekros4442> Man...these animations are so clean....compared to 5
[2:33:08] <%Irridium> tfw ken looks better in smash than in any 3d street fighter
[2:33:15] <+retr0greg> Short haired ken is the worst look ken has had lol
[2:33:18] <@Menitta> Ken in 4 is just 3D He Man.
[2:33:18] <+solzan2000> ken's yellow teeth
[2:33:22] <itzDerrio> Look like he been chewing on his hair
[2:33:25] <Chronoreyer> ggs
[2:33:27] <%yeknomlive> we can all agree smash Ken is the best
[2:33:27] <Arek_1> Ken's face in SFV is only really bad in the character select screen.
[2:33:30] <+LegendaryDorkKnight> sf5 in general looks like trash FeelsBadMan
[2:33:41] <Nerdwarp112> @irridium yeah both Ryu and Ken look better in Smash to me
[2:34:00] <@Solidus_113> Yang in SF4 is voice by Johnny Yong Bosch
[2:34:04] <Chronoreyer> I tried to stand roundhouse but im used to playing cvs2
[2:34:05] <@Solidus_113> I knew I heard Nero
[2:34:10] <Chronoreyer> its very different haha
[2:34:11] <+retr0greg> Sexy ryu should’ve been default SFV ryu
[2:34:16] <%CaptainPileDriver> lol, woolie you wanna have with me if few people are joining?
[2:34:21] <Vulcan422> Oni is banned Kappa
[2:34:23] <+solzan2000> nah SFV looks pretty, but it has some inconsistancy
[2:34:24] <Nerdwarp112> I love bearded Ryu
[2:34:25] <%CaptainPileDriver> *match with me
[2:34:29] <LocalRobyn> damn it now I want to watch those old videos

[2:37:39] <Davimotion96> Bafael has guides on pretty much anyone on youtoube
[2:37:41] <Nerdwarp112> Do you mean a Street Fighter Discord or does Woolie have a Discord server?

[2:38:01] <Novillion> one of his costumes turin is stick into a plunger
[2:38:21] <%CaptainPileDriver> air fireballs

[2:38:46] <+badjab326> @bloody_billz Dieminion disagrees lol
[2:38:52] <%CaptainPileDriver> and get that match of tokido vs that gen in top 8 where the fireballs are all being chanted by the crowd
[2:38:54] <+badjab326> he hates Guile in SFV
[2:39:04] <TheArrow_> don't forget: sfv guile can shoot sonic booms with his feet
[2:39:11] <+TheOneCalledRock> yeah, i think that plumber rolento costume you got when you bought rolento before ultra officially released

[2:58:49] <c60_Jam> Damn, Poison....
[2:58:49] <weissguard> Poison PogChamp
[2:58:50] <+DarkShadow124> They would ban that in SFV
[2:58:55] <trickquestionz> @Th3SmartAlec That makes more sense when Decapre is doing it. Somehow, but it does.

[2:59:31] <+DarkShadow124> Did Woolie see Blanka's 2nd V-Skill?
[2:59:41] <+PJSmooth> The costume set where everyone got tats was cool
[2:59:43] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Solidnick18 "I'll be your mama" - Poison, probably

[3:01:28] <ittla> maining characters that generate salt is very valid
[3:01:31] <c60_Jam> Do not breathe the same air as Blanka players
[3:01:34] <Lunalios> blanka's the type of guy that triple dips in the communal salsa
[3:01:39] <TheArrow_> i looked a blanka player in the eye once
[3:01:41] <c60_Jam> Do not associate with Blanka players
[3:01:41] <TheArrow_> once
[3:01:46] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Lunalios ...wait
[3:01:51] <%CaptainPileDriver> BLANKA is the type of guy who shits all over the bathroom stall and doesn't tell management
[3:01:52] <+gl0vesup7> Blanka players to the back of the bus
[3:02:00] <@Menitta> I wish there was a character with a Captain Falcon/Judge Dredd style character design
[3:02:01] <SomersaultJustice> did they forget falcon kick is a thing?
[3:02:02] <Solidnick18> oh ibuki
[3:02:02] <+PJSmooth> Ibuki the boyfriend hunting ninja
[3:02:05] <itzDerrio> Ayy ibuki on the scene bish
[3:02:05] <Sir_Blitz> Never trust communal salsa
[3:02:06] <Nerdwarp112> @captainpiledriver sounds about right
[3:02:11] <Jathspuh> @gl0vesup7 cmonBruh
[3:02:13] <%Premium_Heart> its sad they never made SFV and this was the last game in the franchise
[3:02:51] <@Menitta> Ok I dont care what anyone says with 5, that game has a BANGER OST
[3:02:52] <+MTLer> @heartbbyy truuuuu
[3:02:54] <%CaptainPileDriver> that last character better be someone amazing in sf5
[3:02:58] <ChrisM341> The only song I can recall from SFV is the Besch stage and G's theme
[3:02:59] <itzDerrio> >_> one hit wonder
[3:03:00] <+gl0vesup7> @jathspuh chill I’m biracial like logic
[3:03:11] <c60_Jam> SF has some secret greatest hits
[3:03:12] <%Th3SmartAlec> @ChrisM341 RAAAASHIDOOOOO
[3:03:13] <Arek_1> SFIV Ibuki kunai oki mixups. LUL

[3:03:14] <thegreatbambe> fucking blanka
[3:03:16] <artificiallynatural> aint the last character gil? or is that not confirmed?
[3:03:17] <clack14> falke theme is pretty cool
[3:03:24] <zamzoph> Ibuki not being able to get a boyfriend is the most unrealistic part of Street Fighter
[3:03:24] <itzDerrio> GTF OFF THE SCENE
[3:03:25] <Zayasu> i love karins theme in sfv
[3:03:27] <gk1llah> dropping combos
[3:03:29] <clack14> gill and one more char
[3:03:30] <ittla> dam wooli nasty tho
[3:03:31] <ChrisM341> @th3smartalec Kappa
[3:03:31] <+PJSmooth> There's another character after Gill
[3:03:38] <+Huderga> is this wollie bullies people with blanka?
[3:03:45] <Nerdwarp112> @artificiallynatural yeah Gil had a trailer
[3:03:45] <@Menitta> I work out to SFV's ost. its sick
[3:03:49] <Novillion> FANG's theme is great to just chill to
[3:03:53] <gk1llah> @huderga rooKek
[3:03:58] <+badjab326> SFV has a godlike OST
[3:04:03] <itzDerrio> @zamzoph would u date a girl that can whoop yo ass?
[3:04:03] <+MTLer> Reggie gonna use eryu?
[3:04:10] <Chronoreyer> does blanka use ultra 2 for every matchup?
[3:04:10] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:04:11] <@Solidus_113> oh no
[3:04:12] <ChrisM341> Forget that Shit here comes MONGO
[3:04:12] <NotHereToStream> SFV Gills theme is shaping up to be something good
[3:04:13] <@Solidus_113> rufus
[3:04:16] <zamzoph> @bloody_billz hell yes Kreygasm
[3:04:19] <@Menitta> Except Juri theme yes.
[3:04:21] <+DeathRube> @mtler hes been using ryu lol
[3:04:22] <TheArrow_> @bloody_billz hell yes
[3:04:24] <c60_Jam> Juri's theme bangs in headphones
[3:04:31] <itzDerrio> Lmao i knew it xD
[3:04:31] <@Menitta> Guile's SFV theme is my fuckin jam tho
[3:04:32] <mr_miyagucci> sfv juri theme is the weal link in that game for sure
[3:04:33] <c60_Jam> But only 200 IQ headpones
[3:04:38] <+MTLer> damn. ordinary guy
[3:04:39] <+badjab326> Falke, Sagat, Zeku, Menat, Cody all have great themes
[3:04:44] <c60_Jam> OWL2019200iq
[3:04:53] <%CaptainPileDriver> he also has a better parry than RYU
[3:04:54] <+DeathRube> @mtler first game period he played him and destroyed
[3:05:04] <Nerdwarp112> I actually really like some of the newer characters in SFV. Mainly FANG, G, and Kolin.
[3:05:10] <%Irridium> rashid's theme is fuckin' great
[3:05:14] <itzDerrio> Majin buu up in this bxtch
[3:05:15] <%jinking79> Gills better not have 3 supers in 5 like he does in 3rd strike
[3:05:17] <+badjab326> G's theme is godlike too
[3:05:18] <TheArrow_> kolin is sick
[3:05:18] <ChrisM341> Oh god I just remembered Skinny Rufus and Skinny Zangief from SFXT
[3:05:20] <Mysidian_Maestro> Aw jeez, I got wrecked. :) I think Woolie just established he knows how to play the game. GGs regardless!
[3:05:32] <clack14> Brother
[3:05:40] <Nerdwarp112> @chrism341 lmao I remember that
[3:05:49] <NotHereToStream> G is charisma in human form, he's great
[3:05:55] <chronoxgp> i've never beaten them in a fighter, ispend 20 hours in each game, they probably spend hundreds
[3:05:57] <ChrisM341> That ending was funny
[3:05:59] <+MTLer> sfxt was great
[3:06:15] <ittla> tfw we will never get concept rufus
[3:06:16] <ChrisM341> ^ Its more fun to play than watch in my opinion
[3:06:20] <itzDerrio> Sfxt was so shortlived
[3:06:23] <@Menitta> GIFG Street Fighter X Tekken when Kappa
[3:06:35] <+MTLer> gems killed it. but yeah was hella fun to play
[3:06:36] <itzDerrio> It really came and went
[3:06:39] <Arek_1> Fucking Rufus.
[3:06:45] <itzDerrio> No pun intended
[3:06:50] <Novillion> Using breast jiggle physics for Rufus' belly is one of the best jokes in gaming
[3:07:09] <ChrisM341> @menitta I doubt that'll happen but if it does I will try to be there, even though I' not great at it
[3:07:20] <Nerdwarp112> I have such mixed feelings about Rufus’ design
[3:07:22] <zamzoph> we could've gotten Asura, but instead we got a Cammy clone FeelsBadMan
[3:07:24] <clack14> her vt is already in the game as ed vt1

[3:13:04] <trickquestionz> Decapare's win pose feels like a nazi salute clumsy edited by 4Kids into a dab to make it acceptable for american broadcasting
[3:13:05] <itzDerrio> capcom milked tf out of 4 cuz it was so good
[3:13:06] <KnivesEve> gotta support your local meaty entertainers i suppose
[3:13:16] <ChrisM341> I thought the fake kick cancels were only in Cross Tekken or was I doing it wrong?

[3:13:48] <clack14> time STOP
[3:13:56] <%drefizz> the style of the models they went with
[3:14:04] <Arek_1> @trickquestionz Nah, it's, like, an Olympic pose.
[3:14:07] <Sir_Blitz> I would do pretty much whatever Juri asked me to do not gonna lie

[3:14:32] <Chronoreyer> @WoolieVersus but can you do kara tiger shots
[3:14:36] <@Solidus_113> shame
[3:14:38] <artificiallynatural> seeing as how successful 4 was it's a real shocker what they did to 5.
[3:14:38] <+gl0vesup7> @sir_blitz who wouldn’t g
[3:14:43] <itzDerrio> Ok u talkin about graphics not artstyle
[3:14:45] <eldragon_1> GG Woolie
[3:14:59] <itzDerrio> Sf4 artstyle is lit
[3:15:08] <KillMyPast> SFV models and animation are way too inconsistent.
[3:15:10] <%CaptainPileDriver> how do i keep getting in
[3:15:33] <%Irridium> @CaptainPileDriver guess a lot less people here have it on PS4 than originally thought
[3:15:35] <+DeathRube> SETH
[3:15:36] <+gl0vesup7> Sf4 artstyle > sf5
[3:15:39] <NotHereToStream> Kara is cancelling the start animation of an attack into a different one
[3:15:49] <eldragon_1> It’s been too long lol. I kept dropping my light store
[3:15:53] <Novillion> I only have this on PC
[3:15:54] <@Solidus_113> How have we not seen a flowchart Ken yet tonight
[3:16:04] <itzDerrio> Whoever painted those characters portraits are talented
[3:16:08] <Solidnick18> abel theme Kreygasm
[3:16:22] <itzDerrio> Sf5 dont have no real art
[3:16:24] <%Irridium> And whoever did the SFV story art is... less so
[3:16:25] <ChrisM341> I got this on ps3 so whoever's has it on ps3/pc is already doing way better than me
[3:16:25] <+LastHazzerd> where's Cain?
[3:16:35] <itzDerrio> Nah im jk it does but its wack
[3:16:35] <ChrisM341> I meant Ps4
[3:17:03] <Nerdwarp112> If by the art style you mean the character art then I agree with SFIV though graphic-wise it looks dated to me
[3:17:09] <+gl0vesup7> Who is the sf4 portrait artist again?
[3:17:09] <+Grayhammatter> wpw

[3:19:09] <Solidnick18> lol
[3:19:22] <itzDerrio> Thats probably why it loads so slow
[3:19:25] <%yeknomlive> LUL

[3:21:41] <itzDerrio> Just a mini grappler
[3:21:42] <Arek_1> See, that's the thing. SFIV's ink style only comes into play in gameplay during Focus Attacks and victory pose freeze frames.
[3:21:43] <%SeaBassTheLad> i see woolie streaming SF4 and I hop in as fast as I can
[3:22:10] <clack14> yeyeye

[3:23:45] <Solidnick18> now that's street fighter
[3:23:47] <Arek_1> @Novillion Nah, it's Hugo in the background. SFV has a similar situation with Abigail in the background despite him being a playable character.

[3:36:39] <@Menitta> That pack plus Omega mode made for an amazing Fisticuffs
[3:36:42] <ChrisM341> Some of the furry costumes were good. Didn't understand Buson being an elephant though (I think that's what he was)
[3:36:45] <Arek_1> @DarkShadow124 The Horror pack.
[3:36:53] <ChrisM341> *Bison

[3:37:24] <Nerdwarp112> I wasn’t paying attention. Are you guys talking about Squirrel Girl?
[3:37:27] <Brofarian> They should put Squirrel Girl in marvel. Just make her like Slayer in Guilty Gear where she's just humoring everyone and letting them get hits in.
[3:37:53] <Arek_1> All half-circle motions in USFIV are backwards.
[3:37:53] <%damienlunas> yeah but have you seen current squirrel girl

[3:38:16] <%CaptainPileDriver> REVOLVER
[3:38:17] <Nerdwarp112> I had read some of the Squirrel Girl comics and the art style isn’t my favorite but I did enjoy the humor
[3:38:17] <%CaptainPileDriver> IYAAAA
[3:38:19] <itzDerrio> Yeesss
[3:38:19] <SomersaultJustice> JAGGLE
[3:38:20] <spiegspikel> Ew. Adon

[3:39:15] <Nerdwarp112> I prefer Adon’s Japanese voice because he at least sounds kind of cool when he talks

[3:41:13] <%Mtome> Sagit monopolizing those matches
[3:41:14] <@Menitta> cool cool cool
[3:41:17] <goose_attack_almanac> Adon probably lost his shit when Anderson Silva lost. And then probably got super hard when he broke his leg.
