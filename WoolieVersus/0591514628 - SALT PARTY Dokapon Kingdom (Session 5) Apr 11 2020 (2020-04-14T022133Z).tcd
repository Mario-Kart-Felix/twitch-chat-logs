[0:32:01] <concretenj> wasn't the 3rd version of SF4 AE
[0:32:05] <+theparisreview> Hot take: Alpha 3 is best street fighter
[0:32:07] <Klefth> EX is the exception. EX Plus a is decent, EX2 is sick, EX3 is dogshit
[0:32:07] <%doombawkzvs> Zangief can SPD the Red Earth Dinosaur
[0:32:12] <+Cuon_Alpinus> and AE was the best version of SF4 so
[0:32:14] <berasite> Super Ultra Street Figher 2' Arcade Remix Hyper Edition EX + α
[0:32:15] <%jiggy_snipe> @concretenj yep
[0:32:17] <Superdandy96> SF EX3 has a lot of potential. It’s just shame they couldn’t refine yet
[0:32:18] <%gatorafan> Also, some people prefer Alpha 2 to 3

[1:08:34] <%andrei11dr> @yodajr99 I would be on Reggie's side, but he's been in the last place since conception LUL
[1:08:37] <Superdandy96> PogChamp

[1:09:17] <ShadowpulseKDH1> He does have transfer when he gets out
[1:09:18] <%jiggy_snipe> Minh needs to take one trickster to start chaos lol
[1:09:19] <%purplehermit12> sell the spinner, buy the items and field warp and exit the cave and transfer
[1:09:23] <yeetdabsenpai69> no
[1:09:23] <+kekkerscrew> Field warp spinners and trickster and ye could make it
[1:09:24] <+NecDW4> A really good strat for reggie would be to warp out and try and walk over woolie ONCE,
[1:09:25] <Maleicus> he has like 100 field warps

[1:14:02] <Maleicus> hes gonna escape anyways
[1:14:02] <crimsonsaens> You're already at the top so there's no reason to escape
[1:14:02] <light_aeolus> Please. Invest in something else.
[1:14:10] <yeetdabsenpai69> @dastmwolf for a short time later monsters start using undodgeable magic that will instagib him
[1:14:12] <yodajr99> woolie will level magic and crush everyone cause nobody has magic but him

[1:14:39] <%kyh9> MINH'S SECRET ART: HIDDEN SANDBAG
[1:14:43] <yeetdabsenpai69> if they use magic which these guys seem to hate
[1:14:43] <aka_Jigawatt> FINAL FUCK

[1:18:37] <light_aeolus> The warm gloves do have use in the cold. Won't say what tho.
[1:18:43] <dastmwolf> if the later towns in the game are the ones that count Reggie can definetly win

[1:19:40] <%doombawkzvs> I'm forever team reggie
[1:19:42] <yodajr99> that worm could kill him rn

[1:27:17] <berasite> on 3 continent
[1:27:17] <dastmwolf> it's not collusion when the brothers unite to fight the petit Asian
[1:27:20] <%xcompleasedad> Woolie the liar all UP in this bitch
[1:27:22] <nachohangovers> The hit chance will be better on Woolie.
[1:27:27] <+pectusumbra> better to swap with woolie when he gets closer

[1:32:40] <+abrupt_abe> What's the sitch?
[1:32:42] <dogwelder02> oh this might work out
[1:32:45] <powerprotoman> that was the pwoer ranegrs morpher beep guys
[1:32:49] <LeviathanNexus> Greed to Karma combo
[1:32:50] <+nintega010> thtat actually helped Reggie cause he never went to temle
[1:32:54] <%andrei11dr> @yodajr99 And that's why team Reggie is doomed LUL
[1:32:55] <%purplehermit12> Reggie the transfers FIFTY percent

[1:32:57] <+FloorBurger> Somebody's getting fucked!
[1:32:59] <%purplehermit12> potentially.
[1:33:04] <Xeno351> but then it would have only been better to hit woolie
[1:33:06] <%Solidnick18> minh has huge stonks
[1:33:12] <+BNPhone> If this works im back on team Reggie forever
[1:33:13] <glaciusinfinite> Whats the sitch

[1:33:20] <+gustavozxd> points or feet pics, hand it over
[1:33:27] <%doombawkzvs> Reggie secret plan?
[1:33:27] <powerprotoman> So to explain reggies plan he wanted woolie to get closer and then use transfer to swap with him and then three spinner
[1:33:28] <yodajr99> @andrei11dr I have hope for him still
[1:33:32] <+NecDW4> oh SHIT, reggie thinkin ahead on that one
[1:33:34] <Xeno351> the original spell usage is still objectively bad
[1:33:35] <%Hawkbone_> Did Reggie just accidentally make a fucking gigabrain play?
[1:33:35] <crimsonsaens> Why didn't he use sleep on Woolie?
[1:33:46] <+Parrish_broadnax> Too bad he didnt think of head of that beatdown
[1:33:51] <%purplehermit12> that play only works sometimes
[1:33:52] <%andrei11dr> Watch Reggie win this somehow
[1:33:53] <jesse_kun1> uh oh
[1:33:55] <%purplehermit12> it was a huge risk
[1:34:01] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> what a time to randomly unlock woolieREGGIEFUL
[1:34:01] <%purplehermit12> because if the monster made him drop the tricksters
[1:34:06] <%purplehermit12> he'd have been fucked
[1:34:07] <berasite> @crimsonsaens so he can use transfern and switch places with him
[1:34:08] <yodajr99> @hawkbone_ he could turn it into one
[1:34:12] <light_aeolus> Whereis Reggie respawning?
[1:34:12] <+Gespens> WOOLIE THE COWARD
[1:34:13] <+Parrish_broadnax> He was focusing on steps 2- 5 but didnt look at step 1
[1:34:13] <+PenGia> that was free exp
[1:34:14] <%jiggy_snipe> you shouldnt put yourself in combat at all tho
[1:34:23] <light_aeolus> OH.

[1:35:57] <+NecDW4> Man, i kinda wish the cursor had some form of space snap
[1:35:58] <%Jetzord> Knowing Reggie, he's not going to stay in a loop to get back to the castle

[2:23:01] <+gustavozxd> yes woolie, let the salt flow through you
[2:23:04] <Gramcracker55> a better magic defense seems like a good idea.
[2:23:08] <+Rivalsz> the bias is apparent
[2:23:13] <%Hawkbone_> I think Reggie could totally take Woolie in a fight, but I'm not sure about Minh.
[2:23:20] <Axle13j> LOL
[2:23:23] <+Rivalsz> no spoilers chat
[2:23:23] <crimsonsaens> Sell something for Seal Magic maybe?
[2:23:27] <+gustavozxd> LUL at least he's honest
[2:23:28] <ShadowpulseKDH1> Ming is pretty high level
[2:23:34] <sonofthedeepsouth> Alpha is Chad and people that discredit it are memes. Wolves work in packs that have alphas pairing in order words a family but still Alphas
[2:23:44] <ShadowpulseKDH1> *Minh
[2:23:55] <sonofthedeepsouth> DABS ALPHALY
[2:23:56] <%Hawkbone_> Alpha wolves literally don't even exist
[2:23:56] <+InfiniteHav0k> get gust
[2:23:58] <+NecDW4> LOL it's funny seeing Woolie not used to being the one in last place for once
[2:24:00] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[2:24:08] <hookhis> y'know
[2:24:09] <ainda_> REGGIE IS STILL A THREAT
[2:24:16] <+SomeCrazyWizbiz> Is this on PC?
[2:24:17] <ShadowpulseKDH1> Woolie throwing shade!
[2:24:18] <berasite> NotLikeThis i know minh has no magic but he can always buy
[2:24:20] <%Hawkbone_> Woolie is getting real salty in last place.
[2:24:22] <%purplehermit12> isnt reggie straight up stronger than minh?
[2:24:22] <fuji_92> LUL
[2:24:24] <berasite> thing to defend himself
[2:24:29] <vVAstrAVv> "im a threat" y'know
[2:24:29] <+mrcooperblack> a common cold was a threat too dog
[2:24:30] <buerdo> Woolie gonna go across that sectional at minh if hw plays nice with reggie
[2:24:31] <%purplehermit12> like, character wise
[2:24:31] <%Jetzord> I'm just hoping Reggie Purse Cutters Minh to start
[2:24:32] <crimsonsaens> RIP Seal Magic
[2:24:32] <yeildingthought> Woolie don’t die LUL
[2:24:32] <%jiggy_snipe> Reggie did kill Minh earlier but Minh has leveled 2 twice I think
[2:24:35] <yodajr99> the whole alpha concept doesn't exist
[2:24:38] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> If Woolie can get gust from the magic shop he easily stomps Mihn in combat
[2:24:39] <emperordread> From rags to bitches; Reggie's success story
[2:24:39] <%yeknomlive> they're emulating so yeah. this is the wii version
[2:24:41] <dastmwolf> if Minh doesn't dodge Reggie can probs wipe him out in one attack
[2:24:41] <+pectusumbra> Minh is just so fast though, he's really hard to touch
[2:24:45] <%Hawkbone_> @purplehermit12 He has way more attack but Minh is a speedy speedy boi
[2:24:47] <NeroInfinite> yeah but mihn has big speed.
[2:24:53] <+kekkerscrew> The old dogs
[2:24:55] <berasite> magic > speed
[2:24:58] <yeetdabsenpai69> GET GOOD MAGIC
[2:25:06] <Gramcracker55> Magic attack doesn't do anything without a magic stat.
[2:25:07] <+hdDorrein> why is woolie hyping slave dogs?

[2:29:45] <Gramcracker55> Typically if you don't go for a magic build your magic stat ends up quite low.
[2:29:55] <%Hawkbone_> Woolie deserves those kicks
[2:30:00] <Superdandy96> How important is magic in this game?
[2:30:04] <%yeknomlive> but doesnt reduce as much damage
[2:30:04] <berasite> alot
[2:30:09] <%jiggy_snipe> very
[2:30:10] <berasite> at least late game
[2:30:11] <Gramcracker55> Depends
[2:30:12] <+InfiniteHav0k> magic very important
[2:30:22] <Xeno351> late game you need defense against it in some form
[2:30:25] <+InfiniteHav0k> the longer the game goes
[2:30:27] <Psych_man13_13> Reggie def has more mg than Minh
[2:30:27] <+paladinstarbuster> Somebody should of went magic
[2:30:27] <Superdandy96> Uh oh
[2:30:28] <berasite> early magic is kinda bad, but later on it becomes super good
[2:30:28] <%andrei11dr> @superdandy96 You can't dodge it, so pretty good
[2:30:29] <%Hawkbone_> Woolie is so fucking salty

[2:30:50] <sonofthedeepsouth> Yeah dolphins are something eçse
[2:30:50] <%yeknomlive> the magic monsters are rough without guard
[2:30:53] <Gramcracker55> Late game magic is not that great with Magic guard dx . but mid game it can be quite powerfull.
[2:30:54] <%jiggy_snipe> geez

[2:30:56] <+nintega010> don't worry woolie wait until darkling

[3:05:26] <%purplehermit12> Reggies Ryu right.
[3:05:37] <%Jetzord> Yes, he is
[3:05:40] <%doombawkzvs> Reggie is Ken
[3:05:49] <+Rivalsz> technically sense he did go dark hado
[3:05:50] <emperordread> Yup, he even has the darkness lurking within for maximum power
[3:05:51] <berasite> Monk class!
[3:05:51] <%purplehermit12> nahhhh woolies gotta be ken or akuma.

[3:06:28] <emperordread> Minh is Dan who cheated his way to top 8 at Wvo
[3:06:43] <%doombawkzvs> Because Reggie is all about being positive and being a family man, and he isn't susceptable to the Hadou so much as he is prone to violent insanity when pushed too far

[3:31:42] <+Piemen99> Do it woolie!!!
[3:31:49] <%purplehermit12> Woolie you're overthinking it

[3:31:59] <%NWannabe> Woolsplaining at a time like this? He's not wrong, but he ain't convincing them to copy him

[3:32:01] <%feiashtear> Second Floor!!! Lost tech major important!

[3:32:08] <@Solidus_113> !uptime
[3:32:08] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 48 minutes
[3:32:11] <%FuqBoiSlim> is it that serious?
[3:32:13] <Jrocy247> Woolie, You guys have a LONG way to still go, so even if they take towns. You can REALLY reset the board. The BOARD IS IN YOUR HANDS ANYWAY
[3:32:16] <debrv> Don't run! Grit those teeth and delve into the deep! No thinkin' no hesitatin'.
[3:32:30] <+BNPhone> just warp out woolz and eat all the new towns
[3:32:35] <+nintega010> Technically. That is the smart route.
[3:32:51] <%purplehermit12> Besides woolie, if you go darkling takijng towns wouldnt help you anyway
[3:32:52] <%jiggy_snipe> Woolie hasn't been exploring
[3:32:54] <+LCLSmoothie> take towns, the risk is too high
[3:32:59] <MaverickJoker> did... did minh just turn Woolie into a Play Tester?
[3:32:59] <dapperskeleton69> keep in mind the end goal is to be the richest player
[3:33:02] <%jiggy_snipe> he wasted time on that Wabbit and failed
[3:33:02] <%purplehermit12> The risk isnt high enough @iamwood99
[3:33:06] <theturtlesnatcher> Minh running that long com
[3:33:08] <+pectusumbra> Touch the untouchable. Shake the unshakeable. BREAK THE UNBREAKABLE ROW ROW FIGHT THE POWER
[3:33:09] <MaverickJoker> didn't Woolie already serve his time as a play tester?
[3:33:09] <%doombawkzvs> It's all smart play until Woolie does dark and takes them
[3:33:10] <theturtlesnatcher> com
[3:33:10] <+MrAtheGreat> The players are pac-mans and the towns are pellets. WAKKA WAKKA
[3:33:11] <Jrocy247> This risk is NOT high, Because Woolie can become a Darkling guys
[3:33:15] <powerprotoman> woolie consider the following if your gonna darkling towns dont mean shit
[3:33:33] <Klefth> Also, you may want that lost technology
[3:33:34] <+Pookiedaexzile> Woolie is doing Johns
[3:33:36] <+nintega010> Darkling resets everything
[3:33:39] <+Pookiedaexzile> He's doing a Johns
[3:33:40] <+InfiniteHav0k> It wont matter once you use darkling
[3:33:40] <Brutalyte616> Minh is bullshitting you SO hard right now.
[3:33:42] <theturtlesnatcher> darkling you COWARD
[3:33:44] <+BNPhone> lost tech not worth rn
[3:33:45] <Jrocy247> If Woolie became a Darkling. IT RESETS EVERYTHING
[3:33:46] <%doombawkzvs> Darkling
[3:33:47] <%purplehermit12> Lost tech is actually good for him, so it'd be nice.
[3:33:50] <%feiashtear> lost technology god please

[3:34:36] <%NWannabe> @Jrocy247 sure...then someone steals it from him or he darklings and loses it
[3:34:37] <+Pookiedaexzile> If anyone ever loses to Woolie again knowing he has the mentality of Don't hold down back in GRand Finals
[3:34:45] <+Pookiedaexzile> You deserve it
[3:34:46] <DXLelouch24> Woolie your in last place,this isnt a fighting game its designed to help you
[3:35:03] <Jrocy247> @NWannabe You can't steal his Darkling bat away from him
[3:35:06] <+MrAtheGreat> I see Woolie’s auto-recovery strat was taken directly from KOTOR 2
[3:35:11] <%KnivesEve> was this a full day of dokapon?
[3:35:11] <%jiggy_snipe> the only thing Woolie is missing out on right now is grinding but they are all weak right now

[4:22:44] <%Urdunngurdunn> they don't heal like you, Woolie
[4:22:45] <CaramelTaffy> also you could summon then warp so they are trapped while you take towns
[4:22:46] <+agumon9000> RED
[4:22:49] <preppyposs> RED CHEST
[4:22:50] <+Pookiedaexzile> Woolie isn't built for this game

[4:22:52] <+agumon9000> F
[4:22:56] <+BNPhone> they get stuck underwater = have to get item to leave or walk all the way back = you tping out and getting all the towns

[4:23:18] <Brutalyte616> Woolie, you have successfully bitched out. Congratulations.
[4:23:21] <Xeno351> KEY
[4:23:21] <preppyposs> YOU MADE SO MUCH CASH THO
[4:23:24] <+Pookiedaexzile> Woolie finna explain his way into losers bracket

[4:23:27] <debrv> yeah wools. you can come back later.
[4:23:31] <dapperskeleton69> so what did woolie get from the white space?
[4:23:34] <berasite> Don't trust woolie to do good decisions, he used KO charm while using lance
[4:23:34] <SethKyu> Holding tech through 3 classes to master ( monk, mage->Alchemist) probably wouldn't have been smart anyway
[4:23:36] <COMB711> death call
[4:23:38] <%gatorafan> now get the good weapons Wools
[4:23:39] <Jrocy247> Death Call
[4:23:39] <%purplehermit12> Not just the card game
[4:23:40] <+gutlesscoward> he got a death call
[4:23:43] <+pectusumbra> You were never gonna get that much money punching monsters
[4:23:46] <dapperskeleton69> neat
[4:23:47] <%purplehermit12> You also had collected from ALL your towns
[4:23:53] <%purplehermit12> It wasnt just the card game

[4:30:27] <+agumon9000> POCKETS
[4:30:27] <+pectusumbra> Go spend it
[4:30:30] <+BNPhone> Just invest in stocksuh gear
[4:30:30] <reonome> POCKETS
[4:30:31] <%purplehermit12> Okay but you can turn that into real value
[4:30:31] <SethKyu> Money is not safe, true
[4:30:32] <coldfire0007> Invest
[4:30:32] <@Solidus_113> Kappa
[4:30:35] <%Hawkbone_> Reggie can kill Woolie and take it all
[4:30:35] <Jrocy247> POCKETS
[4:30:36] <topendbuzza> time to invest it woolie
[4:30:41] <Brutalyte616> Minh with that item tech, but don't forget his ass is still stuck in the Lost Woods.
[4:30:43] <%purplehermit12> @WoolieVersus Invest it, buy gear, etc.
[4:30:45] <%gatorafan> should have used the golden bug
[4:30:46] <berasite> You can lose towns too @WoolieVersus
[4:30:52] <berasite> LUL
[4:30:53] <Camail> but you have a chance of making it rich
[4:30:54] <%jiggy_snipe> you need new gear
[4:30:55] <%purplehermit12> you can lose towns too LOL
[4:30:58] <AnacondaVirtue> Are you saying you're not confidant in the POCKETS lifestyle, Woolie?
[4:31:06] <SethKyu> Hopefully, you can get a dope weapon before that happen, though
[4:31:08] <%doombawkzvs> @WoolieVersus You're gonna be wearing the freshest suit and battlefist though
[4:31:10] <%purplehermit12> NOT TRUE
[4:31:12] <%Hawkbone_> Yet.
[4:31:13] <topendbuzza> weapons
[4:31:13] <%purplehermit12> There's PLENTY OF GEAR
[4:31:13] <+BNPhone> if you buy good enough gear you'll never lose it Keepo
[4:31:16] <Jrocy247> Muted
[4:31:17] <+paladinstarbuster> it wonly be worth it if you stayed for the lost tech
[4:31:18] <+gustavozxd> this almost sounds like a real life conversation LUL
[4:31:23] <+kekkerscrew> You got the Fashion Magazine
[4:31:25] <%TheOneUpWarrior> you live by the bug, you die by the bug
[4:31:38] <%Urdunngurdunn> You could lose literally any and everything in this game
[4:31:39] <theturtlesnatcher> the bug is the best content arc
[4:31:41] <+pectusumbra> they all take on %, but it's never that much
[4:31:46] <%Hawkbone_> Remember when the King spent your money for no reason?
[4:31:48] <patrickIy> Too much money problems LUL
[4:31:56] <%TheOneUpWarrior> FUCK RPS KID
[4:31:59] <%gatorafan> first world problems
[4:32:03] <Klefth> The gold is the least you can get underwater. Let's just put it that way
[4:32:07] <SethKyu> Town's aren't even safe either, you can lose them, or the can go back to level 1 through events
[4:32:09] <theturtlesnatcher> rps kid best stand user
[4:32:18] <%purplehermit12> You could literally lose anything, this is the nature of dokapon. your towns can be lost, your money can turn into gear which helps you fight which means you wont die often which means you wont LOSE MORE
[4:32:19] <Jrocy247> And it let Reggie catch up with yall too
[4:32:22] <berasite> You can lose towns too woolie LUL nothing is permanent in this game
[4:32:24] <%gatorafan> and Reggie was grinding by avoiding fights as much as possible Kappa
[4:32:28] <Brutalyte616> Actually you can dump however much money you want at a castle that you own, then go back and take it out later.
[4:32:31] <topendbuzza> weapons time
[4:32:31] <fuji_92> but do it tho 4Head
[4:32:32] <%TheOneUpWarrior> hes like a living boulder blocking your path
[4:32:38] <reonome> life is temporary
[4:32:42] <reonome> dokapon is forever
[4:32:45] <%jiggy_snipe> it wasn't as bad as the Wabbit is the point cuz you got somethig
[4:32:56] <%doombawkzvs> Go invest in gear and go back
[4:33:05] <+BNPhone> just bea good enough gear to have a chance to kill shit down there so you'll be good
[4:33:09] <+BNPhone> buy*
[4:33:13] <+pectusumbra> could have stayed and bounced a bit.
[4:33:16] <%purplehermit12> You wouldnt be able to use it yet, but later on you absolutely would @WoolieVersus
[4:33:17] <berasite> Can lose castles too LUL is hard to lose that towns
[4:33:22] <berasite> but it can be done
