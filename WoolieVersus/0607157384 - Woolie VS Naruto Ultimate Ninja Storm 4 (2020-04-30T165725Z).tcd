[0:03:46] <%Ashenik1> Is it the last last one ??
[0:03:47] <%optimasmaximas> @Diana869 well, chat was in the right, cause the kabuto part is coming up and him mentioning kabuto as the example was dumb, but i agree, some people freaked out more than they should have
[0:03:49] <tookool5678> does Woolie know how to combo into a ultimate?
[0:03:50] <Doodle_Taco> Hello chat KonCha
[0:03:57] <FuqBoiSlim> "I am a proud non-reader of books" Kanye "Minh" West

[0:04:26] <%alpacasintophats> does this count as on time?
[0:04:32] <CozyGUNNA> never made a point for it tho!
[0:04:35] <tookool5678> The last few boss are harder.
[0:04:38] <+NWannabe> Also, who else got SOR4 on steam? i may play today\
[0:04:41] <%Kriss1827> technically yeah
[0:04:42] <Morning_Asakura> woolie taking kishimotos writing at face value is cute
[0:04:49] <Diana869> @optimasmaximas yeah i just found it rude that a bunch of people were spamming "shut up and play the game!" thats all
[0:04:51] <%FuqBoiSlim> man I wanna learn robo-fortune so bad. I think I like her than regular ms fortune
[0:05:02] <goldenchaos96> goldenchaos96 subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:05:06] <CozyGUNNA> skullgirls gets me stiff
[0:05:29] <ThornJay> @diana869 part of it probably had to do with the time limit of the stream
[0:05:41] <Diana869> i guess
[0:05:45] <its_sinny> BabyRage
[0:05:46] <%OldManJEWc> I picked up SoR4 and I can't leave the title screen
[0:05:49] <Morning_Asakura> the time limit made chat antsy
[0:05:59] <%optimasmaximas> you guys se the new assasins creed game?
[0:06:03] <%FuqBoiSlim> my go-to team rn is val/band/r.fortune but I swap val with filia sometimes
[0:06:08] <CozyGUNNA> @optimasmaximas yeah
[0:06:16] <%Ashenik1> When did you guys realize Naruto kept getting bad?
[0:06:16] <%Pigg1yJuffs> Nothing hurts me more than the fact that no one plays online for Skullgirls on PS4 and the closest tourney that hosts matches of it is the next state over from me. woolieDATTEBAYO
[0:06:21] <Morning_Asakura> remember when assassin's creed wasnt just another rpg
[0:06:23] <%optimasmaximas> @OldManJEWc oof
[0:06:25] <%FuqBoiSlim> @optimasmaximas it's about Vikings this time right?
[0:06:31] <%optimasmaximas> @FuqBoiSlim yeah
[0:06:40] <Morning_Asakura> @Ashenik1 after pain
[0:06:42] <+pyrojack6> @optimasmaximas you mean the Viking Game that no one was gonna buy so that slapped AC on it for good measure
[0:06:44] <dekkitout> @Ashenik1 When Sasuke first opened his mouth
[0:06:44] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:06:46] <%Wool> Minh stop filtering and reading Twitch chat
[0:06:50] <%optimasmaximas> @Morning_Asakura remember when people begge for it to be more like rpgs
[0:06:52] <+NWannabe> has assassin's creed completed a modern/future story arc ever?
[0:07:08] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @fist_wizard_jay
[0:07:11] <%optimasmaximas> @pyrojack6 no
[0:07:12] <%FuqBoiSlim> @pigg1yjuffs skullgirls on console in dead in general. switch version is a wasteland as well
[0:07:15] <Morning_Asakura> @optimasmaximas guess im in the minority then
[0:07:22] <CozyGUNNA> @ashenik1 the lead up to the war arc, but plague made me realize its been ass all along
[0:07:28] <andrei11dr> There's one thing left that i know, in rest this will be completely new for me so im excited
[0:07:32] <fist_wizard_jay> Time for more bitch ninja Uchiha
[0:07:35] <%Pigg1yJuffs> @fuqboislim A fact that physically hurts me to my core.
[0:07:35] <%Ashenik1> @Morning_Asakura honesteyl I think this is universal point for everybody LUL at least fake madara was cool though
[0:07:37] <Diana869> i still play skullgirls with my friends irl
[0:07:51] <andrei11dr> Existed for trash that is
[0:07:54] <%FuqBoiSlim> So when is Ubisoft gonna cave and make the japan assassin's creed already? havent people been asking for it since brotherhood?
[0:08:04] <%OldManJEWc> Im trying to learn Beowulf tbh
[0:08:04] <+pyrojack6> yep
[0:08:08] <dekkitout> The war arc got real samey after the third power up rotation
[0:08:11] <%optimasmaximas> @Morning_Asakura i prefer the old stealthy stuff too, but i understand the appeal of the newer games, i just wish they found a nice balance of the two because both styles play well
[0:08:19] <%FuqBoiSlim> @pigg1yjuffs it hurts my soul man ft
[0:08:23] <+NWannabe> im shocked people stil lcareabout assassins creed
[0:08:23] <gekizenbu> they're gonna wait until assassins judgement cutting becomes viable
[0:08:23] <%FuqBoiSlim> *fr
[0:08:25] <Morning_Asakura> i keep seeing that fedal japan is played out and im very confused
[0:08:27] <%Pigg1yJuffs> @diana869 Would do this, but I go through the same pain as Woolie. Too good to play with my friends and too trash to compete in tournies.
[0:08:27] <%optimasmaximas> @Diana869 LAUNCH PARTY NEVER ENDS
[0:08:27] <%blastazoid26> Naruto was fine. Didn't care much for Shippuden
[0:08:42] <%Ashenik1> @CozyGUNNA I think before shippuden Naoruto was a cute, after that it is just shit
[0:08:45] <$razielhex> GET IN
[0:08:50] <illtima> Is this the second recording session?
[0:08:51] <Morning_Asakura> @optimasmaximas that i can agree on
[0:08:53] <Diana869> @Pigg1yJuffs thankfully were all trash
[0:08:56] <%Pigg1yJuffs> As well as the aforementioned closest tournies being in another state.

[0:09:13] <%FuqBoiSlim> @morning_asakura people keep saying japan is played out but Ubisoft had since like AC2 to make a japanese AC.

[0:09:32] <%Ashenik1> I love how Ubisoft presents Viking as piliging warriors BUT will never hurt women and children !!!!!
[0:09:34] <fist_wizard_jay> lol
[0:09:35] <%optimasmaximas> @Personified134 not if we make him watch the akatsuki mixtape jutsu Kappa
[0:09:41] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @razielhex

[0:10:06] <MutedMimic> woolieDATTEBAYO
[0:10:06] <%optimasmaximas> @NWannabe just wait till they get to boruto LUL
[0:10:09] <gekizenbu> @NWannabe the direct opposite to woolie's power
[0:10:09] <dekkitout> @Ashenik1 Vikings totally never killed their families in Greece and wore their cursed ashes
[0:10:10] <ThornJay> @ashenik1 they have to 4kidz their historical settings
[0:10:11] <%FuqBoiSlim> This is like 3 tracks in one. tf
[0:10:24] <Morning_Asakura> @FuqBoiSlim like the only japan aesthetic games i can think of sekiro and ghosts and thats just 2 games
[0:10:24] <+NWannabe> I don't think theyare doing boruto. Since it isnt done yet\
[0:10:30] <%Kriss1827> @fuqboislim needs more tracks
[0:10:36] <%optimasmaximas> @FuqBoiSlim you should hear the space jam snoop dog one lol
[0:10:38] <VyperVic> "drop your whole clan" is John Cena actually Itachi?
[0:10:39] <%Ashenik1> @CozyGUNNA Like a felt passion in it. Now it is just ok Naruto has to be this long and be cool what are we going to do
[0:10:40] <MutedMimic> SourPls
[0:10:46] <gruulmagebeast> so what happened with kotor2?
[0:10:47] <%Pigg1yJuffs> The biggest problem that I had with Assassin's Creed was that it should've moved onto modern day at or after 3.
[0:10:47] <bunnyscruff> It sorta sounds like Thanos rapping
[0:10:49] <andrei11dr> Being white in Naruto means that you're a God btw
[0:10:54] <%OldManJEWc> check out my demo CD no jitsu
[0:11:07] <Diana869> @gruulmagebeast little v got sick
[0:11:09] <%FuqBoiSlim> @morning_asakura There's also Nioh 1 and 2 but yeah those are the big ones. not too much competition in all honesty
[0:11:14] <+NWannabe> No..not being white. being clad in all white
[0:11:15] <VyperVic> @gruulmagebeast Little V is sick and they are playing it safe
[0:11:22] <gruulmagebeast> makes sense
[0:11:37] <0rond> is woolie aware of the madara uchiha rap?
[0:11:40] <+Memitim> They're prolly finishing Naruto today, yeah?
[0:11:40] <%FuqBoiSlim> @andrei11dr white as in clothes or skin, brother? cmonBruh
[0:11:40] <CozyGUNNA> im catchin up to kotor 2 on youtube anyway
[0:11:41] <dekkitout> Being clad in all white tends to equate to divinity in most fiction period
[0:11:43] <%optimasmaximas> @andrei11dr yup, white zetsu can make an army of himself? what can black zetsu do? be a parasite, smh japan
[0:11:44] <0rond> I think he will get a real kick out of it
[0:11:53] <+NWannabe> God this series fell off the rails\Like...I am not sure which ended worse, this or bleach
[0:11:58] <%optimasmaximas> THUGENOMIC PogChamp
[0:11:59] <%Exiliator> I dont have as hard time as Woolie understanding why everyone in naruto is fucked up, I mean they all live in a world of near-constant war
[0:12:00] <Morning_Asakura> bleach

[0:12:31] <andrei11dr> @fuqboislim Both LUL
[0:12:33] <%Jetzord> @Aldesso to bad Vince couldn't borrow it
[0:12:34] <VyperVic> naruto had an ending. bleach stopped
[0:12:36] <Morning_Asakura> the final chapters of bleach are the worst things ive ever read
[0:12:36] <Doodle_Taco> @nwannabe Bleach but this was more wasted potential I would say
[0:12:37] <+NWannabe> Probably, Bleach had such wasted potential and it wasted it so fast\the royal guards, the sternitter. just got tossed out SO FAST\
[0:12:44] <%optimasmaximas> btw, does woolie have a link to his playlist anywhere?
[0:12:45] <gruulmagebeast> yo that curse mark art is pretty cool
[0:12:47] <+Jerimoi> Yo what is this song?
[0:12:50] <+Jerimoi> This is insane
[0:12:52] <%FuqBoiSlim> @andrei11dr I see woolieDATTEBAYO
[0:12:58] <+Memitim> It's John Cena's OG theme, idk
[0:13:03] <%Exiliator> Lets send our youths to other villages to kill eachother, It'll increase cooperation between countries!
[0:13:07] <%Kriss1827> @morning_asakura think the anime will fix it?
[0:13:09] <+NWannabe> I think Bleach had more ptotential it just burnt thru it so fast that you got mental whiplash
[0:13:12] <%optimasmaximas> @Jerimoi john cena thugenomics remix with some ff7 mudsic
[0:13:12] <extradopeness> This shit is hot yeah it’s the old Cena theme
[0:13:14] <%Ashenik1> I really long for some good us realistic open world where armour actaully matters and any knight is like a fucking boss and not just some enemy. But you know Ubi has to Ubi
[0:13:15] <CozyGUNNA> bleach had terrible fights
[0:13:19] <andrei11dr> woolieGASM woolieGASM woolieGASM woolieGASM woolieGASM
[0:13:22] <+Aldesso> @Jetzord OMG i forgot about that segment where he says the N Word
[0:13:24] <VyperVic> matchedup with the ff7 battle theme
[0:13:26] <CozyGUNNA> complicated powers
[0:13:29] <+psydaku> Basic Thugganomics mixed with Barret's theme
[0:13:38] <Diana869> i still say bleach is worth reading till Aizen is gone
[0:13:41] <ThornJay> @nwannabe didn't kubo get forced into ending early or something?
[0:13:42] <DragonSpooker> Has Woolie seen Itachi make eggs

[0:21:32] <XdaXcaptainX> have i missed any talk about woolie watching his homework?
[0:21:38] <%vextalyst> cheer500 Yo woolie recently learned on the podcast that watching the YT vod helps you out much more than the twitch vods so I'll be watching all of those from now on and encourage others to do so as well. Also hope you've watched the anime version of Night Guy as it's hype AF
[0:21:39] <%optimasmaximas> @XdaXcaptainX nah
[0:21:40] <%nothuzad> Reggie offsets all his Ls with absurd luck
[0:21:52] <XdaXcaptainX> fuck yeah on time
[0:21:59] <FrostedZaibatsu> I hear woolie but i dont see him
[0:22:05] <Picosunloaded> did you watch the anime fight with guy @WoolieVersus ?
[0:22:06] <Doodle_Taco> Yo those OPs are hype

[0:22:41] <%MyNameIsRasus> Naruto? Dumb? Whaaaaaaaaat? Kappa
[0:22:42] <Doodle_Taco> @dekkitout The one with the Kages and animals fighting Madara
[0:22:43] <+redyoshi5> my god when was the last time i heard that
[0:22:46] <%ggbhtg> OP13 is Niwaka
[0:22:48] <CozyGUNNA> @irfan_ filthy frank
[0:22:48] <FrostedZaibatsu> @optimasmaximas its joke
[0:22:49] <%optimasmaximas> @deviljhojho_ oh boy does it
[0:22:50] <phatmac16> It gets dumber
[0:22:52] <Diana869> we can only go dumber
[0:22:52] <+kyh9> @dekkitout The one with the hokages being super imposed onto images of natural animals
[0:22:53] <rubbishbinge> Last fight is pretty alright
[0:22:53] <%Irridium> The english dub is fantastic
[0:22:55] <nepwar> chat has they mentioned if they watched the might guy anime fight?

[0:23:00] <%deviljhojho_> @optimasmaximas oh baby
[0:23:02] <+Kamennoo> woah slow down no its not better than neirs
[0:23:03] <Morning_Asakura> the ost for x2 is really good
[0:23:06] <%deviljhojho_> xenoblade soundtrack is top of the shelf
[0:23:07] <+kewlmyc> That British dub is awesome, the fuck!?
[0:23:10] <Shishi1205> Big timesink
[0:23:10] <DragonSpooker> I only played X
[0:23:11] <Morning_Asakura> but not nier good
[0:23:12] <%DatAsuna> I like the OST but that's a take
[0:23:12] <irfan_> @CozyGUNNA is that really it? i knew he popularized it but to the extent that it did?
[0:23:16] <%blastazoid26> Xenoblade 1 is a masterpiece
[0:23:22] <%nintega010> Played all 3. Great Games
[0:23:22] <%nothuzad> x2 has some good pieces but better thna nier? Id disagree
[0:23:24] <OmegaZeroX2> @ggbhtg Yo doodBro doodBro doodBro doodBro scarfTempo doodThirst doodHey doodOuch doodSmug doodSweet doodNuts
[0:23:29] <Zelretch3000> oi, I like my irish catgirls
[0:23:31] <+kyh9> Xenoblade does not have a bad game as a series, Fucking Fight me
[0:23:32] <%DatAsuna> X has nothing to do with the others more or less
[0:23:39] <%Javaa01> But it's locked to the WiiU
[0:23:40] <%DatAsuna> don't worry about playing chronicles first
[0:23:41] <Doodle_Taco> That's Chronicles I believe
[0:23:45] <%nothuzad> mohnadou
[0:23:47] <%Javaa01> And doesn't even emulate well
[0:23:48] <+kyh9> Xenoblade does not have a single bad game
[0:23:48] <VyperVic> @Zelretch3000 wasn't she welsh?
[0:23:48] <CozyGUNNA> @irfan_ i say part of it. also because it sounds very anime already lmao
[0:23:54] <%deviljhojho_> xenoblade has been pure quality, people that bounced off 2 are weak
[0:23:55] <%blastazoid26> THe MOnaDo
[0:24:02] <Alzero83> Nooooo
[0:24:04] <phatmac16> Too long of a game Woolie

[0:24:08] <+kyh9> @deviljhojho_ It's a true pleb filter
[0:24:10] <+kewlmyc> they're barely related at this point, but I don't blame you
[0:24:10] <%nothuzad> Im really feeling it blastazoid26 :)
[0:24:16] <OmegaZeroX2> @alzero83 Yo doodBro doodBro doodBro doodBro doodBro scarfTempo doodThirst doodHey doodOuch doodSmug doodSweet doodNuts
[0:24:19] <%ggbhtg> You guys are asking for it, but 8th Gate Guy in the anime is factually inferior to the game. It was shorter in the manga and they just adapted that.
[0:24:19] <bunnyscruff> Dumb goofy dubs are the fucking best
[0:24:21] <%optimasmaximas> @Irridium yuri is fantastic, kakashi is, shikimaru is, temari is, guy is- well actually, i guess when you think about it everyone that isn't naruto is great oof LUL
[0:24:26] <%deviljhojho_> @kyh9 true that
[0:24:29] <Alzero83> @OmegaZeroX2 doodBro
[0:24:30] <transporterthesequel> Na Xenosaga tho
[0:24:32] <Morning_Asakura> namco x capcom 2 opening was great
[0:24:35] <Dragamation> Namco X Capcom is cool cuz Klonoa is there
[0:24:36] <glass_marcus> Playing 2 right now. Little disappointed theres no fashion, but its good so far
[0:24:37] <+kyh9> Just play Gears Disc 1 and then watch a youtube video of Disc 2
[0:24:38] <%blastazoid26> @nothuzad IT'S REYN TIME
[0:24:40] <rubbishbinge> but T-ELOS
[0:24:47] <%nothuzad> T-ELOS Kreygasm
[0:24:48] <NickHatesSnow> Xenosaga is awful man
[0:24:48] <%deviljhojho_> she really is
[0:24:52] <Alzero83> Saga isnt Blade
[0:24:53] <%optimasmaximas> i only of namco x capcom cause youre outro, thank you @WoolieVersus
[0:24:55] <andrei11dr> KOSMOS is Jesus's mother tho
[0:24:56] <phatmac16> You’re good
[0:25:09] <Zayasu> @OmegaZeroX2 how are you subbed to zero? LUL
[0:25:11] <+kyh9> Saga's story is arguably one of the wildest
[0:25:13] <NickHatesSnow> KOSMOS looks cooler than she is
[0:25:16] <%optimasmaximas> i like op 17 more than 16
[0:25:16] <%DatAsuna> You can basically play just X with no lore trouble at all
[0:25:20] <%OUTheTeam> yeah n
[0:25:25] <OmegaZeroX2> @zayasu Yes I am
[0:25:27] <LeaIsChill> 16 is great
[0:25:29] <%Kriss1827> Op 16 isnt even the best one imo
[0:25:32] <nepwar> nepwar
[0:25:40] <%optimasmaximas> i really like op6
[0:25:40] <dekkitout> Game version is way better
[0:25:41] <LeaIsChill> Ending 33 is also Madara's opening
[0:25:42] <%OUTheTeam> no need to play saga
[0:25:46] <+kewlmyc> ...what?
[0:25:46] <%DatAsuna> bit of both
[0:25:48] <DragonSpooker> Can we just watch all of them in marathon form
[0:25:51] <%ggbhtg> Imma say it again: You guys are asking for it, but 8th Gate Guy in the anime is factually inferior to the game. It was shorter in the manga and they just adapted that.
[0:25:52] <rubbishbinge> is 16 Kana Boon?
[0:25:56] <%Tearonex> OP 6 will always be my favourite
[0:26:10] <LeaIsChill> 16 is Kana-Boon
[0:26:13] <%Kriss1827> @tearonex YEP mine too
[0:26:14] <%optimasmaximas> @LeaIsChill hitori janai yo
[0:26:15] <CozyGUNNA> OP 5 from og naruto is my favourite
[0:26:15] <%ggbhtg> 16 is Kana Boon, misae no sei, all that
[0:26:25] <Doodle_Taco> @cozygunna based
[0:26:25] <%optimasmaximas> lets be real
[0:26:28] <Zelretch3000> OP 16 is the filthy frank one right?
[0:26:30] <Morning_Asakura> @ggbhtg but you're right
[0:26:31] <%optimasmaximas> the NUNS4 op is the best
[0:26:31] <rubbishbinge> ah, that one's alright
[0:26:38] <%OldManJEWc> OldManJEWc subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! Yo, hope you guys are doing well. Booted up Streets of Rage 4 and I can't leave the title screen/main menu. Send help Keep doing whatcha doin and May the force serve you well

[0:27:32] <%Kazuhira_Boat> bleach op 1 best op
[0:27:32] <CozyGUNNA> yeah
[0:27:34] <%Kriss1827> i also like the full version of op 10 Newsong
[0:27:35] <%ggbhtg> Online? You mean RATE THE SUPER
[0:27:37] <%RioGascar> But the input being trickery would make it so its not 100% execution
[0:27:44] <CozyGUNNA> @kazuhira_boat goat
[0:27:50] <+kyh9> Geese's FUCKING COUNTER is bullshit without an input to indicate it to the other player

[0:27:52] <%RioGascar> Since even pros can drop combos and
[0:28:02] <%RioGascar> Pros make mistakes too
[0:28:14] <%jiggy_snipe> thats how alot of tiers work
[0:28:25] <%ggbhtg> Top players in Tekken drop shit and miss as well
[0:28:29] <+PulsinFufu> rooNom
[0:28:42] <%Javaa01> Yeah with KI if you botch your execution and drop the combo then you're missing out on a lot of damage
[0:28:57] <+hawk_rush> oh weird, it was supposed to be $50
[0:29:06] <+hawk_rush> why did 15 get taken off?

[0:29:31] <Morning_Asakura> support the official release
[0:29:32] <%optimasmaximas> @ggbhtg i think all adaptations screwed the pooch, the anime team shows what it's supposed to look like in op 17 but then it looks nothing like that in the actaul anime fight, and NUNS does an alright job, but it still doesn't look the intedned version kishi envisioned and that i and otrhers envisioned when reading, and that envisionment was only ever realized in the few frames of op 17 unfortunately
[0:29:33] <+hawk_rush> Ah fuck, I used CAD

[0:29:52] <%optimasmaximas> @fizzguy47 7:30 pm est
[0:29:58] <1matheuw> damn
[0:30:03] <+RaidenKyrielight> If you wanna stop people from watching the vods, you can make it subs only
[0:30:08] <%blastazoid26> Melty Blood for GLORY when?
[0:30:13] <CozyGUNNA> oh they’re playing melty tn?
[0:30:14] <%Binary_Fireball> its money to store videos
[0:30:14] <%ggbhtg> @woolieversus you need a special request like Max does
[0:30:16] <dekkitout> This VoD will self destruct in 5-4---1
[0:30:17] <Shishi1205> Do They still go if you highlight them?
[0:30:21] <andrei11dr> Unless you highlight them
[0:30:29] <%Exiliator> @RaidenKyrielight I sure hope he doesnt, and I AM a sub
[0:30:32] <Morning_Asakura> highlights work
[0:30:39] <%Jetzord> @optimasmaximas you know if we're using CCCaster or not?
[0:30:45] <%MyNameIsRasus> Make it sub only
[0:30:51] <+rheviel> Hi manga readers, I'm a anime watcher just popping in while I catch up on the VODs
[0:30:51] <%ggbhtg> you can also Highlight a whole stream if you want
[0:30:52] <+fizzguy47> @blastazoid26 can you even play MB for fun?
[0:31:02] <sendart> I hate the intros you put on the youtube vids
[0:31:02] <%blastazoid26> not really
[0:31:06] <andrei11dr> But some people just don't want to watch a 5 hour video
[0:31:10] <allmightythunder> some streamers make it sub only
[0:31:15] <%ggbhtg> in Iceland or the Philippines or this place
[0:31:18] <%DatAsuna> youtube doesn't preserve chat sadly
[0:31:19] <Bloodhit> Just set vods to subs only then
[0:31:20] <LeaIsChill> CastleSuperBeast is Sub Only and that works
[0:31:24] <Zayasu> podcast vods are sub only
[0:31:27] <irfan_> woolie will figure it out
[0:31:31] <+Aldesso> Make it sub only like the podcast
[0:31:31] <andrei11dr> So they go for YouTube anyway
[0:31:38] <XdaXcaptainX> can we not please.
[0:31:39] <Brandon__Brando> @woolieversus just make them sub only
[0:31:40] <%Exiliator> From what I've seen, sub only vods just drive away new viewers MASSIVELY
[0:31:44] <Shishi1205> Can you highlight them? @WoolieVersus
[0:31:49] <+kewlmyc> Don't delete VODs as we will lose all of this chat and donation reads like this.
[0:31:49] <%DatAsuna> Sometimes you wanna check a vod for th popoff TO the popoff
[0:31:49] <Shishi1205> Pat and max do it
[0:31:51] <+DrFacilier> twitch only saves chat for like a month
[0:31:54] <%ggbhtg> Gotta borrow some Avoiding The Puddle tech
[0:31:56] <stanlychicken> thanks for deciding not to delete them, i watch vods a lot
[0:31:59] <+fizzguy47> what is this aboot?
[0:32:01] <+RaidenKyrielight> @Exiliator you're not wrong
[0:32:14] <Zebroneath> Sounds like a good idea.
[0:32:21] <+Memitim> Sub only VODs sounds good
[0:32:24] <%ggbhtg> Max dood has a special request for the past couple years to preserve ALL VODs
[0:32:27] <+kewlmyc> I'm cool with that
[0:32:31] <LeaIsChill> Let the manga readers opt in
[0:32:31] <%Exiliator> @WoolieVersus Sub only vods are new-viewer POISON
[0:32:44] <BallerSwagBro9k> @WoolieVersus Theres Twitch plugins that can make chat appear on the screen preserving it for Youtube
[0:32:46] <%GrassCannon> Do what you gotta do, Wools
[0:32:56] <%ggbhtg> but in the end, we need Woolie TO EAT
[0:33:02] <CozyGUNNA> fact
[0:33:05] <VyperVic> Sub only vods got me to sub to the podcast on twitch
[0:33:06] <%ggbhtg> Woolie NEEDS FOOD BADLY
[0:33:11] <Morning_Asakura> let woolie HAVE MONEY
[0:33:15] <%FuqBoiSlim> sbfpGou sbfpGi
[0:33:16] <%optimasmaximas> @oscar_m510 thats almost the same as my list; op 5, 6, 16, 17, 19, 20 are mine, and special mentions to op 3, 7, and 12
[0:33:20] <%ggbhtg> SuperBeast NEEDS FOOD BADLY
[0:33:26] <helidzz> Sure, but the visuals are super important. I hate just listening to a podcast. For me I need visuals.
[0:33:26] <rubbishbinge> Woolz must be FED
[0:33:29] <LeaIsChill> Woolie needs a new gamer cube
[0:33:31] <irfan_> i dont think sub only would work for the manga of woolievs
[0:33:32] <+rheviel> is this a discussion on this playthrough because spoilers or as a whole future talk?
[0:33:36] <Brandon__Brando> @woolieversus I dont feel like it would cause too much frustration as the youtube channel is there
[0:33:36] <%FuqBoiSlim> I subbed to the friendcast channel for the vods and the emotes sbfpGou sbfpGi sbfpDattebayo

[0:52:38] <MutedMimic> Me with the new Gits opening FeelsBadMan
[0:52:39] <+Caidezes> Diver is the best opening.
[0:52:41] <scrublordinv> Op 7 or OG Naruto a best
[0:52:43] <Kira2993> 6 7 19
[0:52:44] <WizardofWazz> FIGHTING DREAM-AS
[0:52:44] <%DensityD> don't worry about it. stockholme syndrom is heathy 4Head
[0:52:45] <+GreenCMD> I've hated and then loved pretty much every JoJo OP
[0:52:46] <zamzoph> Fighting Dreamers has the English bias
[0:52:46] <cornerstorecoroner> hggWoke hggWoke hggWoke
[0:52:48] <glass_marcus> Remember and yura yura need more live
[0:52:49] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Silhouette tho

[0:53:06] <+SleepingPliskin> op 6 of shippuden for me
[0:53:10] <wendigo172> Op 14 is underrated
[0:53:11] <+Memitim> Shippuden 6
[0:53:12] <evilaltruistic> I always love Fighting Dreamers
[0:53:12] <foghornleghorn55> watch ed 33 the "madara did nothing wrong" ending
[0:53:13] <0rond> the opening of storm 4 is by the same people who made silhouette
[0:53:14] <rosemon5001> @WoolieVersus the song was used for a video avengers infinity war anime opening you should check it out

[0:53:27] <Darby2> 6 and 13 of shippuden are my go to
[0:53:28] <Alzero83> Naruto Storm 4 Intro is Hype by Kana Boon
[0:53:30] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> All that is near us we must know!!!

[1:07:52] <Daba_mk2> Anime spoils anime all the time if you think about it
[1:07:56] <%optimasmaximas> @Irridium cant believe the naruto game previews spoiled the naruto manga with LUL
[1:07:57] <andrei11dr> The Sage if The Six Paths is straight up some Buddhism, Deva shit in a supposed world ninja
[1:07:58] <InfiniteSwagbito> @SON0ROUS Naruto was never about "Hard Work" actually stop that
[1:08:02] <+NarcissistCactus> no shut up though
[1:08:04] <CozyGUNNA> its not that bad
[1:08:05] <InfiniteSwagbito> I'm tired of hearing about "hard work"
[1:08:06] <Zbyrd0961> the anime spoiling the anime
[1:08:07] <SSBBfan666> PlaugeofGripes made a vid about how hypocrite the series is for Naruto
[1:08:08] <InfiniteSwagbito> it was never about that
[1:08:11] <%Solidnick18> first reaction
[1:08:18] <+tearknack> Plague was wrong
[1:08:18] <%jiggy_snipe> the anime spoiled the game lol
[1:08:26] <InfiniteSwagbito> it was never about Hard Work and it pisses me off that Plauge spread the wrong shit
[1:08:27] <+lunarlegendx> @SSBBfan666 that video has a ton of problems though
[1:08:28] <LilacKing> Spoliers : Narutos also part quincy
[1:08:29] <+Caidezes> It's really not that big a deal.

[1:08:29] <%DensityD> get on this dick simultaneously
[1:08:29] <nepwar> its spoiler if you a crazy person that wanted to learn naruto from NUNS only with no anime/manga context
[1:08:29] <%OUTheTeam> i'm just here for the reaction to the cash money tbh
[1:08:31] <korth367> Stop spoiling yourself by watching the correct material

[1:08:40] <LeaIsChill> Wow, I can't believe the anime would spoil the game like this. Lazy anime peeps
[1:08:43] <+MrRabbles> Naurto anime spoiling the WoolieVS anime
[1:08:46] <InfiniteSwagbito> @SON0ROUS Neither were about Hard Work
[1:08:47] <rubbishbinge> How many times Plague gotta say that was a joke video, purposely poorly made
[1:08:52] <+NarcissistCactus> naruto worked hard to earn his nine tails
[1:08:53] <+hawk_rush> YEP
[1:08:57] <bunnyscruff> Yeah Naruto wasn't about hard work, it was about fucking Kaiju
[1:08:57] <%Ashenik1> @InfiniteSwagbito It wants you to belive in it. Maybe even it believes in it itself, but yeah hard work is bullshit in the end

[1:10:21] <%Ashenik1> The only thing that Naruto has made for himself is Talk no Jutsu
[1:10:22] <Diana869> i think Garaa is the only character that i still liked at the end
[1:10:22] <dekkitout> That is the face of a dead ass motherfucker
[1:10:22] <+KilogramHours> @nintega010 They are fine, but Storm is better. Obviously the games leave out a ton.

[1:15:23] <%Pigg1yJuffs> Kishimoto doesn't understand romance.
[1:15:28] <+tearknack> crush into love
[1:15:29] <%alpacasintophats> obsession paves the path to ruin

[1:15:47] <%Exiliator> I mean people in this world tend to make people into crutches, probably because they are all child soldiers and all that

[1:17:16] <+NiSoKr> Ehhhhh
[1:17:17] <%Exiliator> He saved her from kidnappers
[1:17:18] <+KilogramHours> Hinata and Naruto is fine.
[1:17:18] <T_Sasquatch> Minato and kushina have a normal flashback
[1:17:19] <xthomaswellertonx> Minato and Kushina is wholesome
[1:17:19] <+Ether101_Prime> Ino and Sai?
[1:17:20] <%optimasmaximas> @WoolieVersus minato x kushina is normal
[1:17:23] <phatmac16> they're adorable
[1:17:24] <+PenGia> Naruto and Hinata actually have a bunch of moments for buildup they're just all in the movie dedicated to their marriage lol
[1:17:25] <%MyNameIsRasus> Sai and Ino was mega casual
[1:17:26] <InfiniteSwagbito> Minato/Kushina are normal and super wholesome

[1:17:36] <%jiggy_snipe> "Ninja story"
[1:17:37] <@Solidus_113> You saw that already in NUNS3, Minato saves her
[1:17:37] <LeaIsChill> Sai and Ino, Choji and Karui are the only two
[1:17:37] <+hawk_rush> choji and karui is so random
[1:17:38] <muniea3> good point Minh
[1:17:40] <+PenGia> Flashbacks for days
[1:17:40] <phatmac16> Minato and Kushina are cute
[1:17:40] <%nothuzad> samurai 8 says "ooof" :P
[1:17:41] <%GrassCannon> "Ninja" story
[1:17:41] <BallerSwagBro9k> @Ether101_Prime No she used him as a Sasuke replacement
[1:17:41] <lotharrio> Minato and Kushina was basically "what if a male Hinata was attracted to a Sakura."
[1:17:42] <lbhosdelgado> naruto is a rom com let's be real
[1:17:43] <tookool5678> he can do bromance
[1:17:44] <%gatorafan> yeah... Ninja
[1:17:44] <+oscar_m510> it's the fans fault LUL
[1:17:45] <evilaltruistic> Ino and Sai is the most healthy relationship in the manga
[1:17:45] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> LUL
[1:17:46] <+RaidenKyrielight> But what about a Girl and a Girl?
[1:17:47] <+wjones0415> clearly he cant!
[1:17:47] <xthomaswellertonx> TFW the chat doesnt exist
[1:17:51] <%Exiliator> Because the world is fucked! This is what Obito was talking about!
[1:17:51] <%optimasmaximas> wait....
[1:17:52] <%the_vedo_show> atpRtsd
[1:17:54] <SON0ROUS> narutos love for ichiraku is more convincing
[1:17:55] <andrei11dr> None of the girls get any important writing
[1:17:56] <%optimasmaximas> did rin ever love anyone? LUL
[1:17:57] <venomfury86> Naruto&Sasuke Kappa
[1:17:57] <fist_wizard_jay> Kushina totally used CBT Jutsu on Minato
[1:17:57] <smexyshiro> @pengia so basically its retconned to make sense since it didnt bedore?
[1:18:00] <%nintega010> Sakura literally had to tell Naruto to go out with Hinata. they needed a whole movie to get Naruto to like her
[1:18:02] <VyperVic> Game sound is low
[1:18:03] <+thesyndrome> coming back as a zombie and having to fight alongside the guy who murdered you must suck
[1:18:04] <%optimasmaximas> i cant remember if she liked kakashi or nnot LYL
[1:18:09] <%DensityD> strom guage getting large
[1:18:09] <andrei11dr> Except for Hinata
[1:18:10] <+TheDankDemon> soft hearted sure gramps LUL
[1:18:12] <hassanico2> "I'm just curious! WARCRIMES WOOO!"
[1:18:12] <T_Sasquatch> Choji Chocho and Karui in boruto are amazing
[1:18:12] <+KilogramHours> @WoolieVersus Yeah the zombies retain their full persoalities, but they just cont control their bodies.
[1:18:20] <+Ether101_Prime> @BallerSwagBro9k Didn't they flirt at one point.
[1:18:21] <+PenGia> Nah they interact a couple times over the course of the series in nonconfrontational non-murdery ways
[1:18:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> He likes to watch
[1:18:24] <%Kriss1827> Woolie should watch Naruto The Last
[1:18:29] <GoldeNOVA> Naruto's love for Sasuke is more developed than Naruto and Hinata Kappa
[1:18:30] <rubbishbinge> Orochimaru is best mom
[1:18:36] <+PenGia> The timeskip and wacky ninja war stuff just overshadows it
[1:18:38] <phatmac16> game audio is low
[1:18:39] <+oscar_m510> @kriss1827 I mean it IS cannon
[1:18:40] <+BaronVonFatty> this sweet silence
[1:18:40] <+GreenCMD> in the anime Oro is pretty tsun to the 3rd
[1:18:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> @rubbishbinge And best dad.
[1:18:43] <bunnyscruff> Guruguru's animations are so good
[1:18:43] <nasubi_benjamin> At least it's not like Araki where male and femal relationships are non existent in jojo
[1:18:45] <%Ashenik1> the best part about that movie was Naruto trying to hit in Hinata and she actauly wasnt interested or rather awkward about it
[1:18:45] <+NWannabe> guruwhat?
[1:18:46] <%DensityD> was that the "god poke" from God Hand?
[1:18:52] <Jane_Lo> i liked tsunade's and jiraiya's relationship that never happened bawkHands
[1:18:54] <rubbishbinge> Kappa
[1:19:01] <SON0ROUS> have naruto and sausuke kissed on screen more than naruto and hinata?
[1:19:02] <0rond> he is using TOBI's animations
[1:19:03] <SSBBfan666> Naruto and Hinata in my eyes was not done well and it all was shoveled into one movie that retcons stuff to make it happen. I'd prefer NaruIno or with one of the filler girls
[1:19:04] <+Tonystarx90> is it just me or the game audio is low?
[1:19:06] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[1:19:06] <evilaltruistic> Naruto love for Sasuke had more screentime than the chicks they ended up getting with. Think about that.
[1:19:08] <%DensityD> MONEY????
[1:19:08] <BallerSwagBro9k> @Ether101_Prime No really....he called her pretty lady but not to flirt. He doesnt have human emotions so he was trying to describe her
[1:19:08] <LeaIsChill> You can assist charge from changing characters too so you can spam that
[1:19:09] <Camail> aaaaaaaaeeeeh

[1:19:58] <0rond> spinny
[1:19:59] <rubbishbinge> I guess
[1:19:59] <+Ether101_Prime> As bad as Naruto is, Bleach is worse.
[1:20:02] <+tearknack> if they remember, they do
[1:20:03] <biomegabear> look at chat
[1:20:04] <T_Sasquatch> only Obito calls him that
[1:20:06] <+thesyndrome> frankly everything about the zetsu's is confusing
[1:20:08] <ThenordicOz> spiral zetsu?
[1:20:09] <nasubi_benjamin> Guruguru is dumb Tobi
[1:20:11] <+GreenCMD> yes unless the subs go with Spiral zetsu
[1:20:12] <+CoronetChris> I think it's just that specific Zetsu
[1:20:12] <%optimasmaximas> @WoolieVersus that white zetsu is a specific one, in his case yes
[1:20:12] <LeaIsChill> Nah, he's the important *different* Zetsu
[1:20:12] <bunnyscruff> I don't know, I always called him Spiral Zetsu
[1:20:13] <VyperVic> Game sound low
[1:20:13] <%Exiliator> Obito called him that, both in the game and in the anime
[1:20:15] <Zbyrd0961> this is the dude who wrapped around obito back when
[1:20:15] <lbhosdelgado> some of the team supers are so crazy
[1:20:16] <GoldeNOVA> Don't look at chat
[1:20:16] <irfan_> guruguru is specifically the one that covers obito
[1:20:16] <+BubbaRands> I just remember white and black Zetsu
[1:20:19] <InfiniteSwagbito> That's what people do
[1:20:20] <rubbishbinge> swirly zetsu is guruguru
[1:20:22] <riderluc> he's just tobi
[1:20:22] <%OUTheTeam> bleach is legit the worst by far
[1:20:22] <Deadbulky> All team specific specials are rad
[1:20:24] <+GreenCMD> spiral zetsu
[1:20:26] <%FuqBoiSlim> So this is Spiral Zetsu? Not bad....

[1:28:13] <Zeemod155> @WoolieVersus what if I were to tell you most people affected by the Jutsu never realize their mistakes and end up trapped forever and to trap them forever is the *actual* goal
[1:28:14] <%taggerung403> You gotta burn your dread and reach out to the truth so you can wake up and get out there
[1:28:14] <+Ether101_Prime> Isn't it BS how the Uchiha have a jutsu to regain their eyes that have been closed?
[1:28:15] <%DukeBlack_> It's not persona rules

[1:28:16] <hassanico2> Chicken blocking?
[1:28:16] <%FuqBoiSlim> woolieLORE
[1:28:20] <%DensityD> chicken substitution
[1:28:22] <InfiniteSwagbito> Chickenblocking and other stuff like that is good but it's mostly for PVP where the opponent isn't a braindead CPU
[1:28:31] <%DensityD> if you don't have fresh, store-bought is fine
[1:28:36] <+mmack093> Like it's not an infinite ability, normally you'd only be able to use it twice in yourlife at the cost of one of your eyes, unless you're danzo and you implant a bunch of eyes in your arm
[1:28:42] <andrei11dr> Literally every fucking villain turns out to be a good person doing wrong in the end, Kishimoto only knows to write 3 tipes of fucking caracters
[1:28:51] <+CoronetChris> My only issue with Kabuto's current design is I hate the stomach snake, why not a snake for a tail?

[1:34:16] <biomegabear> Is kabuto in Boruto?
[1:34:16] <staticshock5> Sounds like Persona
[1:34:17] <Shishi1205> Basically
[1:34:20] <lotharrio> Kabuto had been living a lie for most of his life, either as a spy, double agent, pawn of his master, etc.
[1:34:21] <TraitGene2> izanami was made by the uchiha to deal with other uchiha who went mad with power
[1:34:21] <%jiggy_snipe> @InfiniteSwagbito actual correct answer
[1:34:21] <+Jake_Protagonist> It implies who you are is objective
[1:34:21] <nasubi_benjamin> Yes, and what the problem ?
[1:34:22] <Snakes_dk> true
[1:34:22] <%ggbhtg> JOHNS vs Hold Dat

[1:35:31] <+BubbaRands> Let's watch! PogChamp
[1:35:32] <%Robot_Nixon_> 2 episode filler
[1:35:32] <nepwar> fuck it, not worth it
[1:35:32] <Plugman86> It's Kabuto, he doesn't matter
[1:35:33] <biomegabear> @thesyndrome huh thats interesting I would not expect that.
[1:35:33] <sendart> ITS NOT THAT IMPORANT
[1:35:33] <+GreenCMD> Do it with homework
[1:35:37] <rosemon5001> it shows leaf ninjas being 100% evil
[1:35:38] <Kira2993> It doesnt even matter now
[1:35:38] <InfiniteSwagbito> We already saw everything that's important, I don't know why he's confused
[1:35:38] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> This is still the most roundabout way to experience Naruto LUL
[1:35:39] <2fa2st2> let's go, do it for your favorite character
[1:35:42] <CozyGUNNA> read it tbh
[1:35:42] <+NWannabe> What kind of person is kabuto or how does izanami work?
[1:35:43] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus what do you actually want to know, state it exactly
[1:35:43] <tookool5678> homework is better
[1:35:43] <%mankeyfigh> Watch it LATER
[1:35:46] <+RaidenKyrielight> Just do it off stream
[1:35:48] <riderluc> too long
[1:35:49] <%OUTheTeam> LITERALLY it's just that he liv3d his life living as different ppl because he was a spy! @woolieversus
[1:35:50] <+BubbaRands> TALK TIME NOW
[1:35:50] <bunnyscruff> Please don't watch it, it's not worth it
[1:35:54] <%legacy0117> Well, this got random.
[1:35:56] <+jazzcrasher> It really is not that important.
[1:35:56] <%Robot_Nixon_> they really padded 2 whole episodes to some dude that doesnt matter anymore
[1:35:57] <+hawk_rush> chat was super stupid about that
[1:35:59] <%ggbhtg> @woolieversus that homework his OVERDUE
[1:36:02] <+NWannabe> What does he not understand?
[1:36:02] <NickHatesSnow> 3
[1:36:03] <Zbyrd0961> its not necessray
[1:36:03] <%Lion_kun> Itss a pointless flashback it adds nothing
[1:36:03] <%jiggy_snipe> chat always wrong
[1:36:05] <+bluedude153> My friend has read all of naruto in the time it takes them to beat this game this way
[1:36:05] <%ggbhtg> IS
[1:36:09] <Deadbulky> Not worth
[1:36:10] <+thesyndrome> no, I was telling minh to shut up about kabuto because kabuto sucks dick
[1:36:10] <MutedMimic> Chat wrong? Woah LUL
[1:36:13] <%jiggy_snipe> read the wiki bruh
[1:36:13] <andrei11dr> Oh boy
[1:36:13] <+hawk_rush> yeah, read it!
[1:36:14] <evilaltruistic> !uptime
[1:36:15] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 36 minutes
[1:36:16] <nepwar> let's read
[1:36:18] <bunnyscruff> It is literally not worth it
[1:36:19] <%MyNameIsRasus> Probably
[1:36:20] <Kira2993> someone type it on chat quick
[1:36:21] <%Wool> WIKI READ PARTY
[1:36:22] <masterfire23> hmm maybe
[1:36:22] <+NarcissistCactus> yeah fuck it
[1:36:23] <+Jake_Protagonist> yeah you can read

[1:36:24] <Plugman86> reading's better
[1:36:24] <evilaltruistic> that's it? is it done?
[1:36:24] <InfiniteSwagbito> It's really not worth it
[1:36:24] <%Solidnick18> idk
[1:36:25] <GoldeNOVA> storytime
[1:36:25] <+hawk_rush> it's probably not worth it
[1:36:26] <Nekros4442> The point is that Kabuto has spent his entire life living as different people instead of himself. Even now he's full on trying to be Orochimaru before he got Izanami'd
[1:36:27] <venomfury86> "Nothing... it's a gun, Woolie"
[1:36:28] <Doodle_Taco> Izanami is just plot jutsu, don't think too much about it
[1:36:28] <%alpacasintophats> not worth it me thinks
[1:36:28] <phatmac16> someone on chat type it
[1:36:30] <Kuj999> He good though
[1:36:30] <riderluc> full burst
[1:36:31] <Morning_Asakura> why are we doing this
[1:36:32] <+Ether101_Prime> No. Wiki's got spoilers for Sarada.
[1:36:34] <+hawk_rush> to care about kabuto spoilers
[1:36:35] <Kuj999> No
[1:36:36] <%CommanderSqueaks> @venomfury86 What does it have in Trickster?
[1:36:37] <%mankeyfigh> Ehhhhhhh no
[1:36:38] <bbHighvalor> woolie becoming PAT
[1:36:39] <evilaltruistic> will they stop playing the game?
[1:36:39] <InfiniteSwagbito> @venomfury86 oh god you're right
[1:36:40] <Zbyrd0961> this is the content we came for
[1:36:43] <%DensityD> no no
[1:36:44] <+NWannabe> Kabuto is amazing. No god given powers, no bs eyes, just did the work and god fucking good.
[1:36:46] <+hawk_rush> @Ether101_Prime he already knows about sarada
[1:36:46] <+NarcissistCactus> oh no boruto spoilers D:
[1:36:46] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @Ether101_Prime i dont think Woolie cares about Boruto
[1:36:48] <Shishi1205> The nun
[1:36:49] <bunnyscruff> Eyyy let's read
[1:36:50] <+bizzer10> is this the wifi with psycho kirby?
[1:36:52] <brunoberserk> read the wiki : the pat's way
[1:36:53] <+tearknack> i do actually like kabuto tbh
[1:36:53] <%jiggy_snipe> more orphans
[1:36:53] <+CoronetChris> The nun
[1:36:54] <+Aldesso> Wooli was always Pat, he was just gppd at hiding it
[1:36:54] <%DensityD> more round glasses
[1:36:58] <KidKaiser23> I pray he don’t see the Boruto spoilers
[1:36:58] <nasubi_benjamin> @Ether101_Prime Boruto stuff are irrelevant , no one cares about that shit
[1:36:59] <%optimasmaximas> @WoolieVersus just state specifically what you want, and chat will either tell you it or tell you to wait until later in the game or watch it to find out
[1:37:00] <SON0ROUS> nono is a milf
[1:37:01] <%nintega010> @NWannabe shoot that is Sakura
[1:37:01] <InfiniteSwagbito> glasses are sentimental

[1:37:14] <staticshock5> @nwannabe Kabuto basically always pretended to be someone else and has never been himself. Izanami basically tells him to be himself for once in his life.

[1:43:41] <+Jake_Protagonist> Swing-chan is a independent stand that, when acquired, forces you have to have tragic backstory that feels you with a sense of loneliness. It's only weakness is talk no Jutsu.
[1:43:42] <%MyNameIsRasus> @taggerung403 that's Hanzo

[1:43:44] <staticshock5> @woolieversus That backstory was anime only. it never happened in the manga
[1:43:44] <%CommanderSqueaks> @nasubi_benjamin When those layers are made up of cow dung, it's not really a compliment.
[1:43:44] <lotharrio> Danzo probably jerked off real hard over one of Sarutobi's students being a big villain.

[1:44:24] <Shishi1205> Always blame Danzo
[1:44:25] <biomegabear> Makes sense now why Kabuto would run an ophanage in boruto
[1:44:27] <digoquadros> yes
[1:44:29] <+RICE02> thats racist Woolie
[1:44:29] <irfan_> The nun was a spy that stopped to build the orphanage, hence why danzo forced her in the first place
[1:44:30] <InfiniteSwagbito> Man, the stream suddenly dying on me. Shit.
[1:44:31] <+CoronetChris> DANZO STARTED IT ALL
[1:44:32] <+mmack093> The only good thing Sasuke ever did was murder Danzo's ass
[1:44:32] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[1:44:39] <%jiggy_snipe> look if anything seems suspicious, just blame Danzo
[1:44:39] <%taggerung403> @BallerSwagBro9k appreciate the recognition of the reference
[1:44:43] <phatmac16> DANZO IS PALPATINE
[1:44:45] <rubbishbinge> Just because he's white doesn't mean he's evil!
[1:44:46] <+tearknack> yes
[1:44:48] <andrex2311> LUL
[1:44:52] <OmegaZeroX2> scarfXD
[1:44:53] <phatmac16> Blame Danzo for everything
[1:44:53] <KingVantq> money ON
[1:44:54] <+tearknack> there is that connection
[1:44:54] <+ineek10> thats racist man thats how his clan looks ffs Woolie
[1:44:56] <%MyNameIsRasus> THE DANZO SPEAK
[1:45:00] <0rond> danzo is to blame for the vast majority of shit though
[1:45:00] <%optimasmaximas> @InfiniteSwagbito ill let you know if they continue to the next part
[1:45:00] <InfiniteSwagbito> @WoolieVersus Orochimaru made Danzo's eye arm, btw
[1:45:00] <andrei11dr> "Kill the orphans" Orochimaru during the last war
[1:45:03] <%nintega010> orichimaru is just weird. He does his own thing
[1:45:05] <GoldeNOVA> Child Orochimaru holding Mein Kampf
[1:45:05] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:45:05] <+Ether101_Prime> Oruchimu made Danzo's arm.
[1:45:10] <%ggbhtg> Danzo is a super asshole, so I'll believe it
[1:45:10] <%JohnAtDawn> @WoolieVersus A lot of anime filler made Danzo responsible for even more stupid shit
[1:45:13] <+funnyfunnykid> Danzo has a proximity that gives you the evil
[1:45:13] <InfiniteSwagbito> @optimasmaximas It's back up and running, massive stuttering and loading for a bit
[1:45:15] <+tearknack> danzo was at least enabling orochimaru's evil bullshit, and setting him against Sarutobi
[1:45:23] <T_Sasquatch> orochimaru is literally evil because he wants to be immortal for knowledge
[1:45:24] <Kira2993> from the next chapter onward is basically all MONEY
[1:45:26] <@Solidus_113> no
[1:45:27] <0rond> nearly everything bad in the world of naruto can be traced to one of 4 people
[1:45:30] <%Robot_Nixon_> the final final showdown
[1:45:31] <Shishi1205> No
[1:45:32] <hassanico2> It isn't

[1:52:57] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[1:52:59] <Kira2993> Woolie, you could've gotten into One Piece yet here we are Kappa
[1:53:00] <Nekros4442> Guess what happens in Boruto
[1:53:00] <DaBelovedUnderdog> the story is about cycles
[1:53:01] <%jiggy_snipe> @InfiniteSwagbito i guess but DS1 stands on its own just fine imo

[1:53:12] <+CoronetChris> ANOTHA ONE
[1:53:13] <+LTKonnor> 2 Brothers and the Healslut
[1:53:13] <Morning_Asakura> Samurai 8 sucks
[1:53:13] <%jiggy_snipe> the cycle isnt a new concept
[1:53:14] <KidKaiser23> Kishimoto based Sakura off his Wife, Hinata is his OC, and his brother is the Sasuke to his Naruto
[1:53:14] <T_Sasquatch> Sasuke and Naruto are basically related if you go far back enough
[1:53:14] <yaboiiunclephil> GUESS WHAT WOOLIE
[1:53:15] <lotharrio> @nothuzad Should have added another guy.
[1:53:18] <+bluedude153> Samurai 8 was so sad

[1:53:20] <yaboiiunclephil> YOU WILL
[1:53:21] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Can I interest you guys in ONE PIECE WORLDBUILDING
[1:53:21] <Doodle_Taco> THE WAR ARC WAS A MISTAKE
[1:53:22] <%jinking79> think that's bad Bourto doing the same
[1:53:22] <Sapphire_Breeze> Samurai 8 was 1 guy and 1 girl
[1:53:24] <%DatAsuna> time is cyclical
[1:53:26] <%jiggy_snipe> sure KH Kappa
[1:53:26] <+BubbaRands> Dante and Virgil are pretty cool - Kishimoto (probably)
[1:53:27] <hassanico2> BUT RIKU IS COOL
[1:53:27] <InfiniteSwagbito> @jiggy_snipe It's good but you'd be a fool to say there was nothing added in the sequels.
[1:53:27] <CJL_13> Bullshit: On
[1:53:28] <+NiSoKr> Arry Potta
[1:53:28] <%CommanderSqueaks> Woolie ain't seen nothing yet.
[1:53:29] <%Chatterbox1991> s someone who hasnt seen anything of Naruto this is a lot of fun :)
[1:53:29] <hassanico2> UNLIKE SASUKE
[1:53:29] <dekkitout> Hey now- Pokemon Black and White was a fun game
[1:53:31] <+tearknack> this is a super common shonen thing
[1:53:32] <BluBox> The girl is barely there in KH
[1:53:32] <%optimasmaximas> @andrei11dr or the black zetsu bit LUL
[1:53:33] <Lysdexic9541> Khaled Shippuden
[1:53:33] <BearSawed> Buckle up buckaroo
[1:53:34] <DaBelovedUnderdog> so it makes sense that this would be here
[1:53:35] <ThePimpGuin> @MyNameIsRasus One Piece is starting to pull the same shit now
[1:53:36] <WizardofWazz> It's a very Asian Story for sure.
[1:53:36] <%Weeewer> Riku and Kairi >>>>>>>>>>> Sasuke and Sakura
[1:53:36] <gustavozxd> the KH love triangle is OMEGA kingdom hearts
[1:53:40] <megaman_sentinel> double dragon
[1:53:40] <VyperVic> AQUA IS NOT USELESS
[1:53:43] <+ultimafullmetal> Dante and Vergil?
[1:53:44] <CJL_13> Ideas: Off
[1:53:44] <Morning_Asakura> KH is also bad
[1:53:44] <+NarcissistCactus> monkaS
[1:53:44] <+paladinstarbuster> DMC
[1:53:45] <Nekros4442> WE ARE NOT EVEN DONE YET
[1:53:45] <%nothuzad> lotharrio oh that wasnt the only issue V.
[1:53:46] <Aracon_> this is physically killing woolie
[1:53:46] <Shishi1205> Goofy vs serious
[1:53:47] <gustavozxd> i mean naruta
[1:53:47] <Deadbulky> You aint even at the peak yet Woolz LUL
[1:53:48] <+thesyndrome> naruto is killing woolie
[1:53:49] <staticshock5> And Boruto is doing it again.
[1:53:50] <nepwar> ones a genius, ones dumb but has the heart
[1:53:50] <Sp3ctre48> It's not uncommon but it's literally every damn character in Naruto
[1:53:51] <brunoberserk> tag: mind break
[1:53:53] <KidKaiser23> But Kairi doesn’t even like Riku
[1:53:53] <countgaculatv> So what you're saying is Vergil sucks
[1:53:54] <+NWannabe> dude, dmc is not this
[1:53:55] <+GreenCMD> to be fair, none of the others are actual brothers
[1:53:55] <bunnyscruff> In America it was super nerdy black guy, regular nerdy white guy, and girl
[1:53:56] <Sapphire_Breeze> @VyperVic she is the best water goddess
[1:53:57] <Leonheart777> Aqua and Xion are cool tho
[1:53:57] <+Ether101_Prime> Boruto has 3 guys and a girl team.
[1:53:58] <+kewlmyc> Dante and Vergil though
[1:53:58] <+JustCallTre> There is a reason why people compare this to Kingdom Hearts.
[1:53:58] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> WoolieVS NARUTO Back OUT
[1:53:58] <+Caidezes> There's a girl in Kingdom Hearts? You mean Aqua?
[1:53:59] <Eger007> you don't understand woolie, it's a THEME
[1:53:59] <Damie904> Woolie, Kishimoto wanted to be done by Pain. He didnt wanna do this. But when Jump gives you as much money as you want, you gonna say no?
[1:53:59] <%MyNameIsRasus> @ThePimpGuin not really?
[1:53:59] <+tearknack> hey woolie, what are dante and virgil again
[1:54:01] <coldfire0007> Aqua is the best
[1:54:03] <+NWannabe> don't insult other media with red vs blue like that
[1:54:06] <+Ether101_Prime> But their different.
[1:54:06] <InfiniteSwagbito> @Weeewer I agree but Riku is still like.. constant cringe with every line of dialogue lol
[1:54:08] <Shishi1205> All the generations

[1:54:13] <dekkitout> Can someone bonk Kishi on the head so he can make Bort go rogue or whatev

[1:54:15] <riderluc> you haven't seen the crazy that is called boruto
[1:54:15] <biomegabear> yeah we get it
[1:54:19] <andrei11dr> Jojo
[1:54:19] <Brutalyte616> In fairness, Indra and Asura were brothers, but the reincarnations are not. Distantly related? Yes, but after hundreds, if not THOUSANDS of years.

[2:01:31] <+KilogramHours> NEDJI WAS RIGHT
[2:01:31] <%MyNameIsRasus> YES
[2:01:32] <MonsterEnvy> Obito is not a reincariton
[2:01:32] <%jiggy_snipe> Obito aint part of it I think

[2:01:35] <%Ashenik1> NEJI WAS RIGHT
[2:01:36] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @nepwar
[2:01:36] <+thesyndrome> YUP the reincarnation makes NO sense
[2:01:36] <%Reverend_Roscoe> MADARA IS STILL HERE
[2:01:36] <+kyh9> Neji was Right, Destiny does exist and you can't escape it
[2:01:37] <+KilogramHours> NEJI WAS SUPER RIGHT
[2:01:37] <%Irridium> MADARA IS LITERALLY OUTSIDE RIGHT NOW
[2:01:37] <rubbishbinge> Jiraya isnt
[2:01:38] <%Will9099> and the other reincarnations are being summoned too
[2:01:38] <arkv01> lil fuckin narutos!
[2:01:39] <TraitGene2> obito is just some uchiha
[2:01:39] <lunacys_straightjacket> neji was rightt
[2:01:40] <+DragonPuncher12> They are not reincarnations
[2:01:40] <InfiniteSwagbito> Woolie memeing himself into hate without actually thinking about it is having a physical effect on me and I just feel tired and sad.
[2:01:41] <phatmac16> NEJI WAS RIGHTTT
[2:01:41] <R3c0n31> Obito is not involved with this cycle
[2:01:43] <+evbites> NARUTO has too much bullshit in it
[2:01:43] <+tearknack> obito and orochimaru weren't reincarnations
[2:01:44] <CozyGUNNA> NEJI WAS RIGHT
[2:01:45] <Kira2993> Orochimaru is not Sasuke tho
[2:01:47] <KidKaiser23> Oh my god, Sasuke IS Ninja Judas
[2:01:47] <%jinking79> Now u know the true pain is
[2:01:47] <nasubi_benjamin> Obito isn't a part of it
[2:01:48] <+Hollow_Mirage> Obito... Kakashi... Orochi... and Jiraiya
[2:01:48] <phatmac16> #NEJIWASRIGHT
[2:01:49] <gustavozxd> neji was the most right character in anime
[2:01:49] <+Ether101_Prime> Their actually supposed to be ghost haunting people each generation.
[2:01:51] <+Nobrev> obito and all them werent reincarnations of indra and asura woolie
[2:01:51] <transporterthesequel> So was Sarutobi...and Jiraiya
[2:01:52] <+RICE02> wtf is Woolie talking about
[2:01:53] <%legacy0117> This barrel keeps getting deeper the further WE SCRAPE IT....
[2:01:53] <+bluedude153> Obito isnt one
[2:01:53] <Darkrenai> obito and orochimaru weren't reincarnations
[2:01:54] <cahv123> Welcome to the advanced class in STUPID shit.
[2:01:56] <andrei11dr> Wait So is Madara fucking Lilith,
[2:01:58] <%Kriss1827> Theres main character and side character naruto's
[2:02:00] <Leonheart777> "Fuck Hard work, be born as the choosen one bitch" LUL
[2:02:01] <%jiggy_snipe> Orochimaru isnt a reincarnation they're just dicks
[2:02:03] <sonofthedeepsouth> DONt think about it
[2:02:04] <jaygee303> They’re just assholes
[2:02:04] <%eyezehuhh> Woolie using his sharingan here woolieSHOOK
[2:02:06] <%Robot_Nixon_> dont worry about it, but naruto tho
[2:02:06] <+kewlmyc> IT'S LIKE POETRY
[2:02:09] <%Exiliator> "reincarnation" work differently between cultures
[2:02:10] <Seppenator> All the Narutos are dead though
[2:02:10] <%JohnAtDawn> Yeah that's what I don't get. Madara lived for years after Hashirama died. Did the reincarnation have to wait for Madara to die?
[2:02:10] <%taggerung403> Parallels
[2:02:10] <sonofthedeepsouth> STOP THINKING ABOUT IT
[2:02:12] <lotharrio> They're not part of it... they just happen to parallel for reason.
[2:02:13] <+wjones0415> @infiniteswagbito what!? the cycle of hatred stuff was barely there in part 1 outside of anything involving sasuke.
[2:02:16] <%Exiliator> still dumb tho
[2:02:23] <phatmac16> reincarnation
[2:02:24] <its_sinny> reincarnates are probably within the clan
[2:02:24] <TigerClaws12> LUL
[2:02:25] <+thesyndrome> @Jake_Protagonist yup
[2:02:25] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[2:02:28] <%Solidnick18> lmao
[2:02:28] <Aracon_> LUL
[2:02:28] <+NarcissistCactus> what
[2:02:29] <+NWannabe> Also, this is why Kabuto is so great. he got this good without being based on Naruto and Sasuke. He just took their good bits to build himself
[2:02:29] <+Ether101_Prime> Danzo and the Third are this as well.
[2:02:29] <gekizenbu> Reinparallels
[2:02:30] <+Hollow_Mirage> Also how is Madara and sasuke existing at the same time if they are Reincarnated?
[2:02:31] <Shishi1205> Descendants too
[2:02:32] <+TiddlywinkUmbry> People defend this garbage by either overthinking it to the point it seems good, or it's just pure denial. You can still like crap tho, nothing wrong with that.
[2:02:32] <arkv01> KOWASHITEAAAI
[2:02:34] <gustavozxd> god impregnation
[2:02:36] <KidKaiser23> No no no no, Woolie, the Reincarnation is just Hashirama/Madara And Naruto/Sasuke
[2:02:37] <lonlono> This show is fuqin dumb
[2:02:37] <skewerstar> Is woolie KOWASHITAIng because of the Reincarnation?
[2:02:39] <jaygee303> It makes no sense the reincarnation only starts with madara and hasirama but happened 1000 of years ago
[2:02:39] <R3c0n31> there is 1 reincarnation of each at a time
[2:02:40] <CozyGUNNA> naruto n sasuke madara n hashirama are the only reincarnations
[2:02:41] <KidKaiser23> As far as we know
[2:02:43] <+Zanco23> Apparently they're also reincarnations of Madara and Hashirama, they're still alive.
[2:02:43] <%Solidnick18> what minh
[2:02:44] <%Jetzord> @legacy0117 We scraped the bottom of the barrel so much, that we made a new fucking hole
[2:02:46] <gustavozxd> LUL
[2:02:46] <InfiniteSwagbito> @wjones0415 I'm tired, there's non point in trying here anymore. Everyone can just listen to Woolie's memes.
[2:02:47] <KidKaiser23> Kishimoto just can’t write characters
[2:02:48] <+evbites> i thought nar was only chosen cause he had a demon but now he is a god with a demon
[2:02:51] <SON0ROUS> any question?
[2:02:52] <nasubi_benjamin> It's the "Jotaro can use time stop" all over again
[2:02:53] <Camail> its some dumb shit about their chakra

[2:04:02] <nepwar> Yamamoto (wood guy) was like a clone of hasirama. IS HE PART ASURA
[2:04:02] <bunnyscruff> Madara not only reanimated he literally came back to life, but I guess cause he was dead before it somehow makes sense??
[2:04:03] <Animorphimagi> Reincarnation isTHE SAME SOUL
[2:04:03] <yaboiiunclephil> Madara died

[2:04:10] <+bluedude153> MADARA IS DEAD THOUGH
[2:04:12] <cahv123> The Problem is reincarnation says your soul comes back as someone else. The back from the dead jutsu ressurrects your SOUL. See the problem?
[2:04:12] <+HNo4ce> Leaf poetry only LUL
[2:04:12] <rubbishbinge> Rain 3 weren't involved

[2:04:25] <yaboiiunclephil> Madara died and got reanimated dude
[2:04:25] <+FackuIkari> but Madara died before Sasuke was born, Madara is a fucking zombie
[2:04:25] <%alpacasintophats> madara did die though. you still have the obito bit to deal with though so the point stands.
[2:04:28] <lotharrio> Died before Sasuke was born.
[2:04:28] <rubbishbinge> No his literal death
[2:04:28] <+tearknack> it wasn't a spiritual death

[2:15:51] <Kira2993> chosen one is good when done right
[2:15:52] <Aracon_> the chosen one is high up there in how annoying it is
[2:15:52] <MattDemers> "Death for shock value" is my least favorite trope
[2:15:53] <CozyGUNNA> @eyezehuhh u caught up w the manga?
[2:15:53] <Diana869> power of friendship?
[2:15:53] <%legacy0117> Reminds me of Kirby Lore, SERIOUSLY.

[2:16:14] <%optimasmaximas> FUCK RELIGION
[2:16:14] <gustavozxd> dragon quest has chosen ones and they still have good stories
[2:16:16] <nepwar> which is why the inverse of that: the person is a fuckin nobody is the best

[2:16:17] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> WOOLIE VS GOD
[2:16:17] <evilaltruistic> You should watch HXH
[2:16:17] <%Lion_kun> Luffy isnt chosen, he earned the strawhat through his actions
[2:16:17] <%JohnAtDawn> Saying that Naruto never worked hard is the biggest gaslight of this franchise. Plague has actually severely fucked up tons of people's views on this show because he literally doesn't understand Naruto's mental struggle.

[2:16:59] <%DukeBlack_> that can never happen because the mC is inherently the chosen one
[2:16:59] <OldManDeckardCain> JOJO IS LAME THEN Kappa
[2:17:00] <+Hollow_Mirage> Yee Hunter
[2:17:00] <%ggbhtg> DONT RECCOMMEND ONE PIECE chat LUL
[2:17:01] <+oscar_m510> is this manga called Ninjas? No. It's called NARUTO
[2:17:02] <andrei11dr> The only time it's interesting is when the chosen one turns out to be an asshole, like in SMT Nocturne
[2:17:02] <+CoronetChris> Deku isn't a chosen one right?
[2:17:02] <KidKaiser23> Woolie wants the Tyler The Creator story
[2:17:03] <%Sparkseid> Woolie preachin right now
[2:17:03] <evilaltruistic> Hunter X Hunter is great because there's no chosen one.
[2:17:04] <+evbites> the best is when the chosen one is like dude i dont wanna do this when your chosen your life sucks and it's so much pressure please let me be a farmer
[2:17:04] <Belutima> @InfiniteSwagbito yeah sucks to hear.
[2:17:04] <tusk_act4> LUL
[2:17:06] <%DatAsuna> Anakin was chosen to slay those kids

[2:17:16] <%eyezehuhh> uh oh is this something that's in HXH too?
[2:17:17] <+Aldesso> Luffy has the D. but tahts it
[2:17:17] <SON0ROUS> NERO LUL
[2:17:17] <staticshock5> @johnatdawn The thing is literally the power Naruto didn't earn is the power he has now.
[2:17:17] <%DukeBlack_> Demi Fiend wasn't a chosen one
[2:17:17] <%OUTheTeam> JOJO'S are basically all chosen ones when you think about it
[2:17:18] <+Ether101_Prime> I don't think so.
[2:17:19] <+oscar_m510> Naruto is the one cuz it's HIS manga
[2:17:20] <Shishi1205> One Piece chosen ones are the D and theyre not even inmune
[2:17:21] <%Weeewer> Luffy is a deconstruction of a chosen one because he is successful because he DOESNT care, meanwhile Blackbeard totally cares
[2:17:22] <+thesyndrome> and this is why Berserk is amazing, because it's sticking to it's guns of Guts fighting insurmountable odds and destiny
[2:17:22] <+NWannabe> Like...Ace and blackboeard are Ds
[2:17:23] <Belutima> @InfiniteSwagbito glad to catch you stll being around
[2:17:23] <BearSawed> Fun fact, Naruto had a boodline technique he never figured out how to use
[2:17:24] <+JustCallTre> Lol, not like One Piece. when the main characters name has D for DESTINY then no, it doesn't count
[2:17:24] <nepwar> Bang Bang pull my deus ex trigger
[2:17:24] <%ggbhtg> So woolie watched THAT plague video huh LUL
[2:17:25] <dekkitout> Chosen One is grafted to the Skywalker genes
[2:17:25] <+KilogramHours> @NWannabe True, but again his brother is literally the son of the Pirate King.
[2:17:25] <jaygee303> @johnatdawn He worked hard but the path is far easier than it was made out to be
[2:17:26] <+DK_MisterFly> Deku is absolutely a chosen one
[2:17:30] <GoldeNOVA> Shout, shout, let it all out
[2:17:33] <SquigglesTheGreat> Woolie hates kids confirmed
[2:17:33] <+tearknack> um
[2:17:35] <+tearknack> woolie
[2:17:40] <ahairysuprise> You can be a D and still lose
[2:17:41] <InfiniteSwagbito> @Belutima Now you'll see me either here or on the tbfp reddit, where.. I'm gonna have a terrible time making another Naruto "I'll literally answer everything" post
[2:17:43] <T_Sasquatch> Deku is literally chosen
[2:17:43] <+NWannabe> Right and the child of the pk didn't make it
[2:17:44] <+Ether101_Prime> Luffy's Joy Boy.
[2:17:44] <+tearknack> we cant ivnent fucking ki attacks
[2:17:44] <evilaltruistic> deku is LITERALLY the chosen one
[2:17:45] <CozyGUNNA> @dukeblack_ is that a nocturne reference
[2:17:45] <Psych_man13_13> You were supposed to destroy the SITH!
[2:17:46] <+RICE02> Woolie: "I dont like thing, its lazy"
[2:17:47] <%DukeBlack_> Demi Fiend was a back up plan when Lucifer's chosen one died
[2:17:47] <+tearknack> ki isn't real
[2:17:47] <%Lion_kun> In One Piece, Roger's son fucking died.
[2:17:48] <nasubi_benjamin> @DK_MisterFly 100%
[2:17:49] <andrei11dr> Rei....
[2:17:49] <%CommanderSqueaks> @dk_misterfly It's a little different because All Might specifically PICKS him, instead of fate.
[2:17:49] <%legacy0117> Fist of the North Star man.

[2:17:50] <dekkitout> "Grab it by your own hands" -Eureka Seven, which also had a chosen one
[2:17:51] <+oscar_m510> But this manga is called Naruto
[2:17:51] <Deadbulky> Deku should have never gotten powers
[2:17:52] <transporterthesequel> Deku was LITERALLY CHOSEN
[2:17:54] <Kira2993> you can be a D and still die
[2:17:55] <Lunatyr_> Deku was chosen literally
[2:17:56] <venomfury86> DESTINY IS DESTINY
[2:17:57] <giogio346> lol at people saying one piece and forgetting multiple people have that name and also died with that name FailFish
[2:17:57] <+JustCallTre> Hunter X Hunter does a good job of not following it.
[2:17:59] <mrblack499> shonen be like that
[2:17:59] <wendigo172> @infiniteswagbito :(
[2:18:00] <Sapphire_Breeze> DEVIL WOOLIE
[2:18:01] <phatmac16> Deku became a chosen one

[2:18:05] <+oscar_m510> who did you think we were gonna follow
[2:18:06] <+thesyndrome> Life of Brian is a great 'anti-chosen-one' movie
[2:18:06] <Brutalyte616> In fairness, the power of chakra that everybody uses is inherited from Kaguya and the Otsusuki brothers.
[2:18:07] <Leonheart777> Deku is the chosen one tho LUL
[2:18:07] <rubbishbinge> RIP Gon
[2:18:09] <Aydarkzero> You were the chosen one!
[2:18:10] <%DatAsuna> I LOVED YOU
[2:18:10] <Dragamation> @DK_MisterFly which is funny considering the original concept was he was an inventor kid who made gadgets to make up for his lack of superpower
[2:18:11] <%OUTheTeam> Oh boy I need Woolie's reaction to Bleach now
[2:18:12] <nasubi_benjamin> Read Berserk

[2:18:18] <+tearknack> @Lion_kun tbf luffy is the son of Dragon, Grandson of garp, and the Will of D is a thing
[2:18:18] <%DatAsuna> YOU WERE A BROTHER TO ME ANAKIN
[2:18:18] <Belutima> @InfiniteSwagbito annaOMEGA glad you are also a SBFP fan
[2:18:18] <%gatorafan> Destiny 2 is better anyway Kappa
[2:18:18] <%Kriss1827> being a D doesnt mean much in the great scheme of one piece
[2:18:19] <nepwar> deku wasn't chosen by destiny, he wwas chosen for heart, a small but important difference
[2:18:21] <Daba_mk2> That example doesn't work
[2:18:21] <%Weeewer> Nothing in Luffys lineage has ever made him better asides conqueror haki (which like 20 characters have). He was a loser kid who grew strong
[2:18:22] <+NWannabe> chuckles at Woolie's enlightenment

[2:21:30] <nasubi_benjamin> Does Woolie hate My hero Academia too? he must, cuz it's way cringier than Naruto
[2:21:30] <dekkitout> Time for a literal STAND
[2:21:30] <%optimasmaximas> @TheHoody yeah there's a reason for it, i dont exactly remember but i think it has to do with rinnesharingan
[2:21:33] <%FuqBoiSlim> DOPPELGANGER STYLE????
[2:21:33] <LeBlanc233> Doppleganger is stupid broken
[2:21:33] <lotharrio> So would Madara's Limbo techniques have been described by this point?
[2:21:39] <+LTKonnor> This series should have ended after the Pain Arc
[2:21:44] <venomfury86> I think the previous Kyuubi Naruto design looked better
[2:21:45] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Videogame bullshit LUL
[2:21:46] <zecaptain_james> this series has ruined the concept of eye powers for me
[2:21:47] <+bluedude153> As much as Harry Potter sucked, it saying that either harry or Nevil could have been the chosen one based on circumstance was neat
[2:21:53] <Shishi1205> Noisy ass kunai

[2:22:16] <staticshock5> @woolieversus Honestly fans of Naruto, myself included, think the war arc really dropped the series down.
[2:22:16] <+SaltyGhostRock> No one with the last name Longbottom can be a chosen one
[2:22:17] <+CoronetChris> HOW LOW CAN YOU GO

[2:22:39] <+kyh9> @bluedude153 Well it makes a point of showing that the prophecy is actually self-fulfilling because of Voldemort's actions, more than anything special about Harry or Neville themselves
[2:22:42] <+evbites> you know what would be cool if the chosen one was literally a randomly selected kid that was turned into a bomb

[2:35:20] <evilaltruistic> the worst thing is that this is actually pretty hype. but I don't want this from Naruto
[2:35:24] <+OddityOn> Woolie this is a CC2 non canon fight...
[2:35:27] <%nintega010> @lotharrio that would be interesting from ODA
[2:35:28] <its_sinny> susano machine gun
[2:35:29] <%legacy0117> Then I need to watch DM1.
[2:35:29] <skewerstar> Stars are the witnesses of this Ninja bullshit!

[2:38:45] <rosemon5001> maybe just maybe you died by eating every wave in the first part
[2:38:46] <tookool5678> the last game was too hard.
[2:38:46] <+funnyfunnykid> Really, really, large kids
[2:38:50] <wendigo172> It’s for teens
[2:38:52] <+CoronetChris> Some pretty weak kids games
[2:38:53] <Mythundare> weren't you in college
[2:38:54] <rubbishbinge> difficulty in this game is for babby
[2:38:55] <NeetKiller> Shonen has always been for kids/teens
[2:39:01] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> But the last game had HERO OR LEGEND
[2:39:02] <Kira2993> stop facing tanking SUPERS
[2:39:04] <SON0ROUS> the woolie demographic is brutal
[2:39:05] <%OUTheTeam> it's supposed to keep the action flowing without sending you back too much I assume
[2:39:07] <b_ikki> this isnt a great shmup section
[2:39:07] <+Jake_Protagonist> Its not that iots for kids. Its for anime people who wanna watch the games and not just play them
[2:39:08] <%gatorafan> I'm the largest kid I know :)

[2:39:10] <@Solidus_113> omg
[2:39:13] <%CommanderSqueaks> Woolie must be hungry, cause he keeps eating supers
[2:39:15] <venomfury86> Obito vs Mist Ninjas = for children
[2:39:16] <+thesyndrome> just shoot at amadar

[2:39:20] <+hawk_rush> NotLikeThis
[2:39:21] <+thesyndrome> madara
[2:39:21] <evilaltruistic> is this still non-xanon?
[2:39:25] <riderluc> correct was
[2:39:25] <InfiniteSwagbito> @CommanderSqueaks lmao
[2:39:26] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I remember liking naruto back before it sucked too hard, and around that time I was killing DMC1 on DMD
[2:39:28] <InfiniteSwagbito> @evilaltruistic Yes.
[2:39:28] <staticshock5> @evilaltruistic Yes
[2:39:29] <Damie904> Yea this is all cyber connect
[2:39:30] <+CarlosEoM> just kill the guy

[2:39:32] <+TheDankDemon> "YEYEYE" baby woolz
[2:39:32] <tookool5678> you can just aim at the main body
[2:39:37] <SquigglyLizard> Ninjas
[2:39:39] <biomegabear> @CommanderSqueaks that was a great line
[2:39:41] <skewerstar> But for real, they probably realized how bullshit the final bosses of NUNS3 were and dialed down the difficulty this time!
[2:39:43] <rosemon5001> @InfiniteSwagbito at this rate im not going to be suprised if he does
[2:39:48] <Damie904> The meteor thing in the anime is just Sasuke flying into space and slashing them, while Naruto fights the Limbo clones.
[2:39:49] <its_sinny> CHIDORI
[2:39:50] <evilaltruistic> this non-canonical fight is taking way too long.
[2:39:52] <illtima> NINJA BATTLE
[2:40:00] <%Livelinne> There’s definitely a ZOE there
[2:40:00] <%FuqBoiSlim> We do it?
[2:40:01] <Damie904> And none of them have their own Susasnos
[2:40:05] <biomegabear> @evilaltruistic hahaha filler
[2:40:07] <shadowmaksim> Geez, I just played ".Hack//Gu" recently and boy is this giving me some heavy flashbacks. CC2 did both so no wonder.
[2:40:09] <+PenGia> Like every time he slashes twice you have a chance to chidori
[2:40:16] <%jiggy_snipe> they should have done this in the anime
[2:40:20] <InfiniteSwagbito> @evilaltruistic That's because Woolie can't figure out an easy game

[2:57:06] <hassanico2> NECRON
[2:57:06] <SON0ROUS> moon ninjas atpBigot
[2:57:07] <%legacy0117> Bleach at least doesn't have ALIENS.

[2:57:14] <%DatAsuna> Garland wasn't done well
[2:57:14] <%Robot_Nixon_> from ff9?
[2:57:15] <%Pigg1yJuffs> I can't wait for Woolie to spill all of his curses and evils out upon Pat the next time the podcast rolls around.
[2:57:15] <OldManDeckardCain> woolie was under the strongest genjutsu that made him think naruto could be good LUL
[2:57:16] <%MyNameIsRasus> NECRON WAS SICK
[2:57:16] <%DukeBlack_> wtf are you talking about Woolie
[2:57:17] <%Exiliator> @WoolieVersus Thank you Madara for giving them the oppurtunity to show any possible filler story EVER.
[2:57:17] <+JustCallTre> really? You thought Garland was done well?
[2:57:17] <%gatorafan> They inherited the beef Kappa
[2:57:18] <mar_krow> Mommy troubles with ninjas
[2:57:19] <%Robot_Nixon_> oh
[2:57:19] <KidKaiser23> Kaguya was given the reveal that Madara got the legendary groundwork for
[2:57:20] <megaman_sentinel> yea
[2:57:20] <VyperVic> Ganon Twilight Princess
[2:57:21] <SomersaultJustice> ZEROMUS!
[2:57:24] <+captain_history> From FF1
[2:57:24] <%DukeBlack_> Garland is shown in the first part of thegame
[2:57:25] <lotharrio> FF1, Garland becomes Chaos at the end...
[2:57:25] <Frostydough1> Now you must face EVILLGACKT
[2:57:25] <nasubi_benjamin> That was trash too
[2:57:25] <availablethor> Eh, Naruto stayed true to itself. Bleach tripped up and fell.
[2:57:25] <vincerocmm> zoneSweat zoneSweat zoneSweat zoneSweat zoneSweat
[2:57:25] <%colezone_> senator armstrong
[2:57:26] <GoldeNOVA> It's just Lilith
[2:57:26] <masterfire23> oh boy i love the insanity of this stupid DUMB
[2:57:27] <Sp3ctre48> It wasnt even good there
[2:57:28] <staticshock5> I mean Persona 5 did this
[2:57:28] <+kyh9> Garland was done well enough, because you meet him in the beginnin and the end
[2:57:28] <NiktenKing> Zeromus is literally this game
[2:57:29] <%jiggy_snipe> wasnt Garland always the villian?
[2:57:29] <%Ya_Boi_AD> Woolie's stand truly made him think that this shit wouldn't be stupid
[2:57:29] <%Fujiwara_92> BEEF HATED CIRCLE
[2:57:34] <fruit_pie_the_magician> SOME of Bleach was roughly as bad as this
[2:57:34] <%eyezehuhh> woolieS woolieT
[2:57:36] <+trekkie11041> ganon in twilight princess
[2:57:37] <+Bluydee> Zeromus literally came out of nowhere
[2:57:37] <+GreenCMD> I guess, Garlands kinda a nothing tho
[2:57:39] <+OddityOn> Remind Woolie Kishimoto wanted to finish this at the Pain Acr
[2:57:39] <Wight_Trash> MARX
[2:57:39] <%Weeewer> Every persona game ever
[2:57:40] <%eyezehuhh> woolieF woolieU
[2:57:40] <%CommanderSqueaks> First boss becoming the last boss is cool.
[2:57:40] <%DatAsuna> Garland was a terrible execution
[2:57:41] <%Wool> Kaguya is literally Zeromus
[2:57:43] <%Kazuhira_Boat> GIN ICHIMARU is the best part of Bleach
[2:57:43] <Doodle_Taco> Ganon, Zeromus and Garland
[2:57:47] <+OddityOn> *Arc
[2:57:50] <%Livelinne> Mmmmmmm PLOT... clempsGin
[2:57:53] <fairore> that's bullshit woolie
[2:57:53] <%jiggy_snipe> LUL
[2:57:55] <ahairysuprise> Persona 5’s final boss made sense
[2:57:55] <Leonheart777> Zeromus sucks, so did Necron
[2:57:55] <%CommanderSqueaks> Lavos
[2:57:55] <+hawk_rush> BOOO
[2:57:55] <andrei11dr> She's there for no reason, Madara being the final boss would have been totally fine, WHY DID THE DO THIS
[2:57:57] <Ultzerostar00> Didnt Kaguya come up way back when they were fighting Kimimaro?
[2:57:58] <+jjjkopf> ff9
[2:57:59] <staticshock5> @woolieversus Literally every Persona does that
[2:58:03] <Arnoldoaad1> This is worse than Andross on Star Fox Adventures
[2:58:04] <%DatAsuna> nice donation
[2:58:05] <CozyGUNNA> @weeewer only 4 and 5 do this tbh
[2:58:06] <ThePimpGuin> @fruit_pie_the_magician eeeh idk, i feel like characters got plenty of establishment for every arc
[2:58:07] <%ggbhtg> ayyy lmao tho
[2:58:07] <+LandOfTheWay> @evilaltruistic THAT moment doesn't get as much play in this game; it's just a special attack mid-fight
[2:58:08] <arkv01> its me, LAVOS
[2:58:08] <Sokumotanaka> NO KEFKA THE BEST PULL
[2:58:08] <MonsterEnvy> The Alien in Lavos was just just Lavos
[2:58:09] <BakaSurvivah> p4 izanami was ok as an insert final boss
[2:58:10] <UberKingKai> Ff9 has this problem
[2:58:11] <+Bluydee> people saying this is dumber than bleach really need to reread just how shitty the last bleach fight was
[2:58:12] <R3c0n31> WAIT, Did Woolie not catch that Kaguya is LITERALLY an Alien from another World??
[2:58:13] <%Robot_Nixon_> ff9 had it pretty bad
[2:58:13] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @evilaltruistic
[2:58:15] <sunwraith91> Another Decade
[2:58:15] <kalimaruquin5> Kaguya's the final dude from yakuza 1
[2:58:16] <BinaryShuffle> AYYlien NINJAS
[2:58:19] <facuvillamil> @andrei11dr cause they didn't know who to kill him off
[2:58:19] <riderluc> what it's the true evil mankind
[2:58:20] <%DukeBlack_> By every he means 4 and 5
[2:58:20] <%MyNameIsRasus> Except P3's was cool
[2:58:22] <Nekros4442> Nah, Persona 3 didnt have that shit
[2:58:24] <Deadbulky> Kefka is pretty sp;od
[2:58:24] <+captain_history> Not P1 and P2
[2:58:25] <arkv01> FF8 and FF9
[2:58:26] <Plugman86> How much game is left? Can they finish it this session?
[2:58:28] <%Gigmunch> Nah Hitler wa spretty cool in P2
[2:58:29] <%Fujiwara_92> LUL CORE LAVOS
[2:58:29] <%projectmanatees> does zenos from 14 count?
[2:58:29] <hassanico2> @kalimaruquin5 Fucking Jingu man, ugh...
[2:58:31] <mar_krow> Lillith said im coming to smackdown
[2:58:32] <Ultimatefool> This is literally Persona 3 with the world ending terror descending from the moon
[2:58:32] <Sp3ctre48> P3 was fine with how it did this
[2:58:32] <%FuqBoiSlim> tfw no extraterrestrial mommydom gf
[2:58:33] <%legacy0117> That was an awful ending, I will not LIE.
[2:58:35] <+RogueCrocodile> Wasn’t the final form of Lavos just first form cell?
[2:58:36] <Nekros4442> Persona 3 you straight up knew what shit was happening
[2:58:36] <skewerstar> At least this has a boss battle before the Andross twist...
[2:58:37] <fairore> @bluydee anime or manga?
[2:58:37] <staticshock5> @ultzerostar00 Yes. Kimimaru was part of the Kaguya clan.
[2:58:38] <%nintega010> @Bluydee Yawach is so broken
[2:58:39] <Idon__> Woolie never gonna acknowledge P2
[2:58:40] <CozyGUNNA> p1 and p2 didnt do this lmao
[2:58:43] <%ggbhtg> @DukeBlack_ the ones that matter, and 3, yes
[2:58:44] <%DukeBlack_> nah never mind 5 made sense and had hints
[2:58:44] <releasetherats> so Madara... technically never lost tbhIdk
[2:58:45] <phatmac16> P3 does it well
[2:58:45] <%Robot_Nixon_> Kefka fight was amazing
[2:58:45] <T_Sasquatch> Persona starts at 3
[2:58:45] <%jiggy_snipe> Necron
[2:58:46] <+TiddlywinkUmbry> I actually quite like P5R's "real" boss
[2:58:47] <%Ya_Boi_AD> I guess Evangelion did the surprirse twist pretty well???
[2:58:50] <Sp3ctre48> No one played P2, come on chat
[2:58:53] <+BubbaRands> NYX in persona 3 was pretty good
[2:58:53] <CrazyMedicine> This is why you only read the manga
[2:58:54] <SON0ROUS> its weird how persona started at 3
[2:58:54] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[2:58:55] <Sp3ctre48> LUL
[2:58:56] <+CoronetChris> Ywach is garbage
[2:58:56] <fruit_pie_the_magician> But Bleach just introduces, gives backstory to, and then discards characters by the dozen with nothing but asspulls
[2:58:57] <%FuqBoiSlim> I forgot the ending to Persona 1 goddamnit
[2:58:57] <NiktenKing> It's literally the Moon
[2:58:58] <KidKaiser23> @ultzerostar00 Kimimaro is from the Kaguya Clan because this clan and The Hyuga are descendants of the Sage Of Six Paths’ brother who is named Hamura Otsutski
[2:59:00] <Sokumotanaka> Persona 3 did it well cause it's not a surprise
[2:59:00] <xiccy> the dude in p5 sucked dick
[2:59:01] <Daba_mk2> P2 best persona story
[2:59:02] <+paladinstarbuster> Nah kimimaro actually sets this up poorly
[2:59:03] <valachi> P2 > 5 tbh
[2:59:03] <+JFrostyBeats> P2 does that
[2:59:03] <Idon__> SMT starts at Persona 3, guys.
[2:59:03] <Ultzerostar00> @staticshock5 Kaguya clan. Right. I think I remember
[2:59:03] <%optimasmaximas> @SON0ROUS i know right LUL
[2:59:04] <CozyGUNNA> @sp3ctre48 i did >:(
[2:59:04] <WanderingSwordsman> 5 at least gave you a reason
[2:59:04] <%DatAsuna> FF3 maybe did it the worst
[2:59:06] <%DukeBlack_> Nah we were told about nyx throughout 3
[2:59:07] <+no_id_uh> no_id_uh subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[2:59:09] <%Fujiwara_92> EVERY PERSONA FROM 3, SO THE BEGINNING Kappa
[2:59:12] <rubbishbinge> Golbez was alright
[2:59:13] <%DatAsuna> FF9 did it shitty too
[2:59:13] <SSBBfan666> Kaguya was hinted at way back when the Uchiha stone monument was revealed with its inscription, its not an asspull.
[2:59:13] <valachi> Persona isn't even SMT
[2:59:17] <Ultzerostar00> @kidkaiser23 Thanks
[2:59:18] <+captain_history> and it was from the moon too
[2:59:18] <fairore> @ya_boi_ad that twist ruined eva for me
[2:59:19] <StarlitStunner> Golbez in space
[2:59:21] <bunnyscruff> I never played the other personas but I thought it was fine in P5
[2:59:22] <%the_vedo_show> atpRtsd atpRtsd
[2:59:24] <%jiggy_snipe> FF4 is worst
[2:59:24] <MillaMoks> Thast wrong ming
[2:59:24] <%DatAsuna> YU YEVON
[2:59:25] <InfiniteSwagbito> there's a pain in my heart
[2:59:28] <lotharrio> Zeromus was like the undead lich version of Zemus though or something.
[2:59:29] <%Ya_Boi_AD> @fairore There were a lot of 'twists'
[2:59:30] <+TiddlywinkUmbry> persona is smt
[2:59:30] <KidKaiser23> @ultzerostar00 No problem, fam
[2:59:30] <MillaMoks> there is no one behind Xemus
[2:59:31] <Graxe_> Zeromus is the hatred of Zemus taken form
[2:59:31] <arkv01> final fantasy does this a SHITTON
[2:59:32] <+ultimafullmetal> Necron in FF9 too
[2:59:33] <SomersaultJustice> FF4 is big goods
[2:59:34] <Sokumotanaka> yeah ff9 was good until that twist
[2:59:34] <%Weeewer> I mean persona games do it but theyre not bad at it
[2:59:36] <fruit_pie_the_magician> This is just super super dumb, and Bleach was rapid fire asspulls the whole time
[2:59:36] <%jiggy_snipe> because he was never brought up ever in the game
[2:59:36] <+TheDankDemon> who?
[2:59:37] <+kyh9> Yes. Garland was good though
[2:59:37] <%fetrigon> Dragon Quest 8 does this well from what I remember.
[2:59:37] <MillaMoks> you kill him and then his hate is so big it wont die
[2:59:40] <arkv01> necron was like WHOOOO?
[2:59:41] <%Robot_Nixon_> LUL
[2:59:44] <%DatAsuna> ALMOST EVERY FF DOES IT
[2:59:44] <gustavozxd> i was so bored at the end of persona 5, you CANT BEAT rivers in the desert
[2:59:44] <C4m3r0n0409> LUL
[2:59:45] <%BisoromiBear> Zeromus has a tight theme though so I'll let it slide
[2:59:45] <CozyGUNNA> everyone should play persona 2
[2:59:46] <+hawk_rush> LUL
[2:59:46] <arkv01> at least ultimecia was still a sorcerer
[2:59:47] <hassanico2> Even if Minh got it wrong he's right int hat it sucks
[2:59:47] <%the_vedo_show> atpRtsd atpRtsd atpRtsd
[2:59:47] <mar_krow> he wanted that cochie
[2:59:47] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[2:59:48] <Sp3ctre48> It doesnt matter if "final boss that comes out of nowhere" makes sense, it's still lame every time it happens
[2:59:49] <Nekros4442> @Weeewer Nah, 4 and 5 arent very good about it
[2:59:49] <%Robot_Nixon_> atpRtsd atpRtsd
[2:59:50] <evilaltruistic> Persona starts at 4 Golden.
[2:59:50] <+AFoolishPaper> necron tho
[2:59:50] <%Exiliator> I mean Obito was talked about since the beginning
[2:59:52] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[2:59:52] <+tearknack> power behind the throne isn't bad, if you foreshadow it and do it well, say, kefka
[2:59:54] <CozyGUNNA> its the best one
[2:59:54] <Graxe_> Necron actually came out of nowhere and had no bearing on the plot

[3:11:25] <+kyh9> @jiggy_snipe Yeah but these events have no bearing on the story afterwards
[3:11:25] <%gatorafan> I mean... That's very in character
[3:11:25] <Leonheart777> But thats Naruto in a Nutshell tho?
[3:11:26] <+TheDankDemon> no deep emotional connection to moon mommy
[3:11:26] <biomegabear> filler movie
[3:11:27] <%Ya_Boi_AD> WAIT SO THE TEN TAILS ARE THE EMERAL WEAPON???
[3:11:28] <Go4theKnees> how do you write a story for 20 years and not atleast come up with a final arc
[3:11:29] <phatdonk_g> #ZabuzaBetterVillain
[3:11:30] <nepwar> every movei
[3:11:36] <hassanico2> This isn't NARUTO'S conflict, it's someone elese's and he's here
[3:11:37] <C4m3r0n0409> YUP
[3:11:37] <Plugman86> that's literally the Zabuza arc
[3:11:38] <Hellarussian> Zabuza eat your heart out
[3:11:38] <+NarcissistCactus> hat
[3:11:41] <saiyan24675> @ya_boi_ad yes
[3:11:41] <%Sparkseid> Naruto's reaction shouldn't be this strong
[3:11:41] <+RaidenKyrielight> @ggbhtg I heavily envy you.
[3:11:41] <%Ya_Boi_AD> The goddamn weapons from FF7 are the FUCKING TEN TAILS
[3:11:42] <gustavozxd> yeah that makes sense
[3:11:45] <yaboiiunclephil> How do you go from dope ass reanimated Madara to this
[3:11:48] <C4m3r0n0409> 10 TAILS IS KAGUYA
[3:11:49] <%jiggy_snipe> @kyh9 i guess its nice background info
[3:11:52] <%jiggy_snipe> like lore
[3:11:52] <%ggbhtg> @ya_boi_ad if that is a FF thing, YES
[3:11:53] <phatmac16> Villians should have some connection to the main character chat
[3:11:53] <bloodrainXL> Watch the last two movies
[3:11:54] <Arnoldoaad1> Only the editor knew
[3:11:55] <UberKingKai> He visits the city before boruto
[3:11:56] <%jiggy_snipe> idk
[3:11:57] <staticshock5> @ya_boi_ad The funny thing is I'd still rather watch Naruto because the the fight have great choreography
[3:11:57] <InfiniteSwagbito> Weapons and the Ten Tails are nothing alike, btw.
[3:11:58] <Wight_Trash> this guy is hiding in his mommy's sleeves
[3:11:59] <lonlono> Naruto is filler
[3:12:01] <%Robot_Nixon_> this trash lore making my brain hurt
[3:12:05] <ThePimpGuin> its was I, Black goou
[3:12:05] <R3c0n31> There was never a ten tails, only Kaguya
[3:12:05] <KidKaiser23> @ya_boi_ad Yup! You send them, grow them, eat their fruit once they bloom as a tree, and live for another 300-400 years
[3:12:09] <dekkitout> Boruto also casually drops ANOTHER 10 tails
[3:12:09] <%ECRead> That statue is actually a tree is actually a kaiju is actually moon god
[3:12:11] <+kyh9> @jiggy_snipe Sure but why couldn't they just learn this afterwards instead of having to make a really stupid fight out of it?
[3:12:12] <%insomniacCoder> they are trying to save the people in the tree
[3:12:12] <coldfire0007> Zabuza is filler too?
[3:12:12] <venomfury86> "It was me all along"

[3:21:41] <R3c0n31> She only gets confused

[3:21:55] <evilaltruistic> DAMMIT my connection went down did the THING no jutsu happened?
[3:21:55] <%agumon9000> Jesus....This boss fight seems so unfun
[3:21:57] <KidKaiser23> Sakura gets a nosebleed, Kaguya has a mini-stroke
[3:21:59] <Sokumotanaka> she smiles in the manga
[3:22:02] <Lysdexic9541> To be fair, she hasn’t seen some dick in millennia

[3:22:30] <hassanico2> @Noponiz Around
[3:22:30] <%JetpackMcQuack> I’m surprised she isn’t thirsty for Sasuke

[3:27:01] <Daba_mk2> Why is Sakura's design so nothing
[3:27:05] <%nintega010> Sakura is there to make sure Naruto and Sasuke don't mess up
[3:27:07] <+TheDyingPride> Okay, for real though, Midnight Sakura would have been a really sick name if she ever got a truly cool move
[3:27:07] <GoldeNOVA> Uchiha semen retainer Kappa
[3:27:07] <%Ya_Boi_AD> After this she can go home and be a stay at home mom with Sasuke because Boruto fucking hates women
[3:27:07] <ilpeggiore_> wait muda da and giant fist barrage?
[3:27:10] <KidKaiser23> All jokes aside, Sakura has a Top 15 Ultimate in the game

[3:27:48] <lotharrio> No one: I wanna see Sakura's big moment.
[3:27:53] <$Noponiz> fun fact, kishimoto is fucking devastated that girls dont like sakura, since he designed her to be appealing to girls according to himself

[3:28:22] <stanlychicken> those are bone spears
[3:28:22] <tookool5678> They are Bones
[3:28:22] <KidKaiser23> @noponiz Even funnier fact, she is based off his Wife
[3:28:23] <DragonCelt> Kunais? You mean LUNAIS.
[3:28:24] <+paladinstarbuster> REMEMBER KIMIMARO
[3:28:25] <GoldeNOVA> Her awakening is that she becomes a different character
[3:28:25] <phatmac16> bones like kimimaro
[3:28:26] <SON0ROUS> moon rocks
[3:28:26] <+OddityOn> Those are bone spears
[3:28:30] <deafmelone> Calcium
[3:28:30] <Sokumotanaka> Give her some bone hurting juice!
[3:28:31] <lotharrio> Bone spikes. Turns out Kimmimaro was descended from her.
[3:28:31] <%CommanderSqueaks> Boomer Kaguya.
[3:28:31] <%Ya_Boi_AD> WHICH SUCKS because Sakura did have the hint of having actual character at first
[3:28:31] <Idon__> @paladinstarbuster aight that's good
[3:28:34] <mar_krow> its bones cuz she has all ninjustus
[3:28:35] <riderluc> that's bones
[3:28:38] <$Noponiz> @KidKaiser23 does that mean he is as much of a POS as sasuke?
[3:28:40] <mrblack499> nope
[3:28:40] <evilaltruistic> no one remembers Kimimaro
[3:28:43] <DaBigVitus> kochi you god bitch
[3:28:46] <staticshock5> @ya_boi_ad Especially at the start of Shippuden
[3:28:48] <+Bluydee> recall that Kimimaro was part of the Kaguya clan
[3:28:48] <skewerstar> Man, it sucks that Inner Sakura was just a gag...
[3:28:48] <+myhandsareblank> Why the fuck doesnt this god lady go kill naruto and blue bakugo while they frozen
[3:28:50] <KidKaiser23> Those are Bones that disintegrate the target ON CONTACT
[3:28:51] <+YourPalFrost> Kimiwho?
[3:28:52] <valachi> @CommanderSqueaks A surprisingly long amount of time.
[3:28:52] <+CoronetChris> Kaguya has all kekkai genkais
[3:28:54] <tookool5678> Is Billy dead?
[3:28:54] <hassanico2> BTW why does the AI charge chakra despite not having any?
[3:28:56] <%legacy0117> So, the basic folks are somehow surviving this final, final boss?
[3:28:57] <+OddityOn> Remember Kimmimaro? an actual descendant of Kaguya's clan
[3:29:01] <hassanico2> It doesn't
[3:29:02] <%Ya_Boi_AD> Chat, can we all agree that Sakura in Boruto is an insult, even to Shippuden Sakura?
[3:29:06] <dekkitout> Namek
[3:29:06] <Hellarussian> its fitting having Kaguya and Sakura fight as the 2 most bland characters ever
[3:29:07] <hassanico2> This isn't really a fight I think
[3:29:08] <+TheDyingPride> I mean it didn't last long at all
[3:29:09] <%Weeewer> its almost as if the video game is a video game
[3:29:10] <rubbishbinge> Kekkei Mora Kappa
[3:29:12] <%Fujiwara_92> it didn't, this isn't even a fight in the anime
[3:29:15] <dekkitout> It would last a week on Namek
[3:29:17] <+Bluydee> in the manga they just kinda run
[3:29:17] <staticshock5> @ya_boi_ad Why?
[3:29:19] <yeetus181> Hello
[3:29:22] <%CommanderSqueaks> They had to have at least one Sakura fight
[3:29:22] <Shishi1205> Boruto is straight up an insult to some characters
[3:29:23] <%nintega010> @Ya_Boi_AD Boruto Sakura is cool.
[3:29:23] <Go4theKnees> @Ya_Boi_AD she gets that one good fight
[3:29:24] <$Noponiz> boruto sakura is what shippuden sakura deserves @Ya_Boi_AD
[3:29:25] <+Ether101_Prime> Kikashi's dumb momment is about to happen.
[3:29:27] <%legacy0117> This is the silliest.
[3:29:28] <@Solidus_113> using your supports at the worst time
[3:29:31] <YakumoYomi> Video games gotta video game, though.
[3:29:34] <T_Sasquatch> @ya_boi_ad she made sarada so she gets to exist
[3:29:35] <%the_vedo_show> clutch
[3:29:39] <Arblaster_> At least Demon slayer is ending :)
[3:29:40] <%Fujiwara_92> yeah, Sakura as mom is ok in bort
[3:29:42] <Camail> it was all sakura
[3:29:42] <$arcielardor> IT'S THE BATTLE OF THE BLANDS
[3:29:43] <%Ya_Boi_AD> I say that because all I've seen of it is her getting with Sasuke
[3:29:43] <Sokumotanaka> I dont care what the rest of ya'll say if they teleported to the mass effect dimension and Garrus just shot and killed kaguya I wouldn't even be mad.
[3:29:44] <KingVantq> @Fujiwara_92 didnt the game come out before the anime got to kaguya
[3:29:45] <MAX116030> Just like how Dan would have survived fight againt Akuam, in a videogame
[3:29:45] <Deadbulky> Sakura clashing with a deity
[3:29:48] <valachi> Why would you expect anything good from the same series that has chakra miniguns?
[3:29:50] <mrblack499> but who reads that shit
[3:29:51] <arkv01> sankyu!
[3:29:54] <biomegabear> HAHAHAHAHA

[3:38:08] <dekkitout> Sakura was right there too do the magic surgery...
[3:38:09] <+Bluydee> the rabbit form is a single panel technique
[3:38:10] <Dementedpenguin> Remember when Naruto was about ninjas fighting on a bridge?
[3:38:13] <Zeemod155> wtf I'm looking at a manga panel of the Kaguya beast RIGHT NOW chat
[3:38:14] <mortalmanbaby> it does happen
[3:38:14] <Aracon_> NO JUST SEND IT THROUGH YOUR HANDS
[3:38:15] <TheHoody> Why did Madara even give the Sharingan back to Obito after getting both Rinnegans though
[3:38:15] <KidKaiser23> @jiggy_snipe In the manga it was a stupid sky ball that shot out snake like appendages to bite our Heroes
[3:38:19] <+JustCallTre> don't forget about magic jesus ninjas
[3:38:19] <biomegabear> why is kaguya in jump force at all?
[3:38:19] <wendigo172> @doodle_taco that was a mistranslation
[3:38:21] <+Ether101_Prime> Obito achieved Woolie's dream of entering Kakashi's body.
[3:38:21] <T_Sasquatch> Madara literally just swipes IT OUT
[3:38:29] <Doodle_Taco> @wendigo172 Oh okay thanks

[3:38:43] <C4m3r0n0409> BONITIS
[3:38:44] <ThePimpGuin> someone show woolie the clip when madara just swipes kakashis eye and pops it in lol
[3:38:47] <Sp3ctre48> THE BONE GUY
[3:38:48] <rubbishbinge> It's just Obito's chakra, not his eyes
[3:38:48] <sonofthedeepsouth> EYES
[3:38:49] <+Grayhammatter> BONES
[3:38:49] <nepwar> BONITIS
[3:38:50] <+Bluydee> she does transform but it's like a panel
[3:38:50] <VidulaSaix> His name was Kimimaro Kaguya
[3:38:51] <%Exiliator> You are fighting NINJA GOD, who cares about eye surgery LUL
[3:38:54] <lotharrio> That's why they were being persecuted.
[3:38:57] <dekkitout> Sure... totally not a happy coincidence....
[3:38:58] <gustavozxd> not as bad as the prey2016 upgrade thing, oh god NotLikeThis

[3:39:04] <+NarcissistCactus> boner
[3:39:04] <%Will9099> sick as fuck 410 billion bones

[3:39:07] <+gutlesscoward> got milk?
[3:39:09] <%Fujiwara_92> I DUNNO

[3:39:13] <Shishi1205> No Curse Is juugo
[3:39:13] <%jiggy_snipe> @KidKaiser23 lol ikr, the beast is half canon I guess
[3:39:13] <BallerSwagBro9k> @Taglog7 ACTUAL GREAT ADVICE
[3:39:14] <SSBBfan666> the Kaguya clan were just savages, Kimimaro was the only one who could control his bones
[3:39:15] <Daba_mk2> Boneitis LUL
[3:39:15] <+SurphyKeets> the big monster form is in the manga chapter 688 but its not really around much
[3:39:15] <rubbishbinge> Kaguya's bones disintegrate things on contact
[3:39:16] <%colezone_> Kaguya also has byakugan
[3:39:19] <Dcrapman77> What?
[3:39:20] <dekkitout> B o N e L e S s
[3:39:22] <0rond> the manga transformation was different though, it was the tailed beasts trying to escape or some shit
[3:39:26] <0rond> and inflation
[3:39:27] <Dcrapman77> Thats headcannon as hell

[3:46:35] <+bluedude153> Honestly id suggest woolie just reread the last 20 chapters of the manga
[3:46:36] <tookool5678> do super range to finish battle faster.
[3:46:38] <Sokumotanaka> I'm getting drakenguard flashbacks
[3:46:38] <+bluedude153> Does it much better
[3:46:38] <+LUN4RKiD> Storm 2 best game in the series

[3:46:46] <BinaryShuffle> NINJAS
[3:46:46] <phatmac16> Woolie is right
[3:46:47] <@Solidus_113> it's ass dawg
[3:46:47] <apheral> What don't you like about fighting Big Chungus mom?
[3:46:48] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @jiggy_snipe only if you turn down the antialiasing
[3:46:48] <VidulaSaix> It's cause the context of this never existed LUL
[3:46:50] <b_ikki> you mean this isnt incredibly climactic woolie
[3:46:55] <Brutalyte616> If it helps, Kakashi has Susano Kamui Shuriken.
[3:46:56] <+jumbey234> What i am I looking at right now
[3:46:57] <+TheDankDemon> BIG DUMB BUNNY

[3:47:09] <%jiggy_snipe> @Reverend_Roscoe oh ok nevermind
[3:47:09] <0rond> this is pretty cool though. it's dumb as fuck but it is pretty cool
[3:47:10] <InfiniteSwagbito> kamui raikiri is some crazy shit
[3:47:17] <Wight_Trash> yeah this is very sonic 06 final boss
[3:47:18] <%Ya_Boi_AD> So this is unironically Sakua partially doing shit
[3:47:19] <$arcielardor> Woolie, imagine if the game started out like this, with zero context
[3:47:20] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @jiggy_snipe it's not well optimized for 60 fps
[3:47:22] <%Ya_Boi_AD> cuz she was in there with Kakashi

[3:47:28] <BinaryShuffle> This is literally a starfox 64 boss
[3:47:29] <%JetpackMcQuack> I think i’m gonna hate watch Boruto
[3:47:30] <InfiniteSwagbito> because it's CC2 filler

[3:47:37] <Bpbranmuffin> nice
[3:47:38] <Sokumotanaka> @arran_throttle To be fair paner dragon is only lightgun shooter this is a fighting game using this twice and not claiming to be a proffesional of it
[3:47:39] <+IsaiahOmega> did woolie notice the bullshit of Kakashi having a Susanoo for no fucking reason when the series implied it was unique to saskue and Itachi because they are closer related to Madara? ya know something that'd be interesting

[3:49:02] <wendigo172> Planet buster
[3:49:05] <Aracon_> the characters went from cool complex designs to basic binary colors
[3:49:06] <C4m3r0n0409> EASY TO DRAW
[3:49:08] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> its basic anime design
[3:49:08] <VidulaSaix> That doesn't mean it's bad though Woolie. It's just a style
[3:49:08] <Shishi1205> LUL
[3:49:09] <+Bluydee> the details are all the dust and shit in the manga
[3:49:10] <%Ya_Boi_AD> :(
[3:49:10] <+RaidenKyrielight> he's sad now
[3:49:10] <%masterpiecejeremy> @InfiniteSwagbito Yeah THAT part made sense since Kamui's one failure is that one person's vision can only focus on one object at a time, but mixing it with rakiri is so stupid
[3:49:10] <%oscar_m510> gotta draw it every week
[3:49:10] <Hellarussian> YEYEYEYE
[3:49:11] <Psykoknight65> and that's bad?
[3:49:11] <+MrRabbles> literally Kaguya

[3:49:17] <hassanico2> THE :( FACE
[3:49:18] <Doodle_Taco> yep

[3:49:19] <333agus333> Oh hey thanks OBITO COOLEST GUY
[3:49:19] <+CoronetChris> True
[3:49:20] <+paladinstarbuster> artstyles can bedifferent woolie
[3:49:22] <NiktenKing> @WoolieVersus When Naruto hits Kaguya with the Beast Rasenshuriken, she turns into the rabbit beast and then becomes the amalgamate blob, so it is canon.
[3:49:22] <+Aldesso> Yeah but Araki is fuckin crazy
[3:49:23] <+RaidenKyrielight> : (
[3:49:23] <KidKaiser23> @sonofthedeepsouth And she’ll never have them lmao till Bort
[3:49:25] <Bamcc2> scjNom
[3:49:25] <dekkitout> Araki is also not of this Earth
[3:49:25] <+kyh9> More than that, it looks like their outfits aren't real clothing, they look like paper
[3:49:25] <+NarcissistCactus> : <
[3:49:25] <nasubi_benjamin> Nah the Pillar Men were trash
[3:49:26] <gustavozxd> or just characters in naruto classic
[3:49:27] <InfiniteSwagbito> @masterpiecejeremy Oh don't get me wrong it's dumb but it's also neat
[3:49:27] <Zelretch3000> Kinda not fair to compare most manga to Jojo
[3:49:28] <mortalmanbaby> book one of the mangas cover art
[3:49:29] <%Weeewer> theyre not even One Piece or like, FMA tier, or even hunter hunter
[3:49:29] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Its very basic and boring
[3:49:31] <+KilogramHours> Hell even if Oda's designs are simple, they are interesting and funky
[3:49:31] <@Solidus_113> Oh no Dalamud
[3:49:32] <zaitje> But thats araki Woolie and that is just not fair
[3:49:32] <SON0ROUS> yeea but my hand hurts
[3:49:33] <%Ya_Boi_AD> AH YES REMEMBER PLANETARY DEVASTATION?
[3:49:34] <Jetsfantasy> Araki actually likes Fashion Design
[3:49:35] <+TiddlywinkUmbry> I would argue that's entirely stylistic
[3:49:36] <%Ya_Boi_AD> I REMEMBER IT
[3:49:36] <lonlono> Deep villain
[3:49:36] <tookool5678> jojo is a monthly manga while naruto is weekly
[3:49:37] <slamview> Old naruto was great at character design too!!
[3:49:37] <%Exiliator> Comparing to Araki is unfair tho, he overdesigns on purpose
[3:49:37] <DerpioParty> Look at these ninja
[3:49:39] <%Solidnick18> here's my vest
[3:49:39] <b_ikki> yeah naruto characters are plain
[3:49:39] <NeetKiller> Araki also has a sameface problem
[3:49:39] <%jiggy_snipe> I mean they are ninjas so they should have a uniform
[3:49:40] <+Bluydee> if you look at the manga Kishimoto's art has the most detail in this arc
[3:49:40] <worldbrand> while i agree, i think i'd go crazy if everybody tried to do jojo
[3:49:41] <%Fujiwara_92> and that's bad? Woolie, there's other reasons why they bad, not the cause they simple
[3:49:42] <Morning_Asakura> Who the fuck like the designs in naruto??
[3:49:43] <+KilogramHours> One Piece villains are so much better
[3:49:44] <Sokumotanaka> Eh but jojo outfits look aweful in another way
[3:49:44] <Aracon_> I mean look at kaguya
[3:49:45] <%jiggy_snipe> soldiers*
[3:49:45] <%Jetzord> Kubo had some great character designs too
[3:49:45] <%eyezehuhh> even bleach had that
[3:49:46] <%xx123manxx> You want the ninjas to run around in belt jackets? I'm not sure why you're comparing the two LUL
[3:49:46] <VidulaSaix> That;'s not even close to fair Woolie. You're comparing styles and using that as a reason to call something else bad
[3:49:47] <riderluc> different type of art styles
[3:49:47] <%Exiliator> Old naruto is a better comparisong
[3:49:47] <+tearknack> compare with oda isntead or araki
[3:49:47] <+CptnCampy61> THANK YOU
[3:49:48] <venomfury86> Not every anime is Jojo
[3:49:49] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @tookool5678 it was weekly for 6 parts
[3:49:51] <%FuqBoiSlim> Araki is a character design demigod tho
[3:49:52] <Go4theKnees> weekly vs monthly not fair at all
[3:49:54] <+aishman> @WoolieVersus Eyepatch also went into it of how by this arc, no one except Naruto and Sasuke have unique clothes. They all wear the ninja uniform and shit.
[3:49:56] <0rond> yeah the only good designs are naruto and sasuke
[3:49:56] <+JustCallTre> its almost like they're soldiers or something.
[3:49:57] <Hellarussian> MOON
[3:49:57] <+TiddlywinkUmbry> Two completely different styles of art, entirely subjective
[3:49:58] <Aracon_> kaguya is literally 80% white
[3:50:02] <+KilogramHours> ONE PIECE IS GOOD
[3:50:02] <Go4theKnees> thats like comparing berserk to naruto
[3:50:02] <nasubi_benjamin> @WoolieVersus The Pillarmen were trash af
[3:50:03] <C4m3r0n0409> BLEACH IS NOT
[3:50:03] <sonofthedeepsouth> BLEACH
[3:50:03] <Fetty_Krill> That
[3:50:03] <%Exiliator> no?!
[3:50:03] <vincerocmm> h1gh fash10n
[3:50:05] <bigarmsnolegs> true
[3:50:06] <+HawkGoggles2> You telling me you don't like Sasuke's ropes. Kappa
[3:50:06] <ThePimpGuin> Even Kubo makes things more elaborate over time, Ichigo at the end of the series looks fucking dope
[3:50:06] <+NWannabe> So does One Piece
[3:50:07] <sonofthedeepsouth> BLEACH LUL
[3:50:07] <Apolonm> THE HEART
[3:50:08] <Psykoknight65> DO THEY?
[3:50:08] <%Irridium> Fucking Dragon Ball designs are solid for the most part
[3:50:08] <+tearknack> HAHAHA WRONG LOL
[3:50:08] <%alpacasintophats> THAT'S AN OOF
[3:50:09] <+hawk_rush> bleach character designs are A+
[3:50:09] <InfiniteSwagbito> That's because Kubo is ONLY good at character art
[3:50:09] <0rond> tite kubo is a fasion designer
[3:50:09] <%ChoculaUltra> Say it louder for the people in the back about Bleach character design.
[3:50:09] <+paladinstarbuster> tite Kubo loves that stuff
[3:50:09] <Fetty_Krill> That's true
[3:50:09] <+TiddlywinkUmbry> I for one hate Araki's art, not for me
[3:50:10] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> One Piece
[3:50:10] <Alzero83> I dont like jojo
[3:50:10] <%coreyyotto> That's all Bleach has though
[3:50:11] <katocrimson> need draw this guy 100 times... so i'll be lazy and make him simple
[3:50:11] <%Exiliator> BLEACH IS WAY WORSE
[3:50:12] <%OUTheTeam> bleach gave up backgrounds for clothes
[3:50:12] <Jugmentt> bleach characters got mad drip
[3:50:12] <releasetherats> Bleach? idk about that one
[3:50:12] <Jetsfantasy> BLEACH CHARS HAVE OUTFITS EVEN
[3:50:13] <dekkitout> Kubo's character designs are pretty good
[3:50:13] <+RaidenKyrielight> Bleach falls apart at the end
[3:50:14] <+LUN4RKiD> idk about that
[3:50:14] <fangovafang> Saaauuuccee
[3:50:15] <C4m3r0n0409> BLEACH IS WORSE
[3:50:15] <Arnoldoaad1> I agree with Woolie
[3:50:15] <SON0ROUS> DOES IT
[3:50:16] <BinaryShuffle> Bleach Fashion nearly rivals JoJo
[3:50:16] <Plugman86> Bleach is literally the worse pull
[3:50:16] <+ineek10> fk no dont bring up thats bleach shit man
[3:50:16] <+SatsumaVA> Kishimoto had to simplify to work faster
[3:50:16] <stanlychicken> Bleach is just character design
[3:50:16] <tusk_act4> Bleach's design is good
[3:50:17] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @wicketpelican
[3:50:18] <KidKaiser23> @justcalltre Nah man, couldn’t be that!
[3:50:18] <toomuchsnarf> Hmmmmm
[3:50:18] <+Aldesso> Not at the end.
[3:50:18] <mar_krow> DO THEY WOOLIE
[3:50:18] <%Weeewer> its true
[3:50:18] <sonofthedeepsouth> READ ONE PIECE
[3:50:18] <shadowmaksim> Gotta be honest, I can't say I really agree with that assertion.
[3:50:19] <%alpacasintophats> THAT'S A t101Big t101Oof
[3:50:20] <%Solidnick18> YEs
[3:50:20] <+jumbey234> Making art is hard
[3:50:20] <lotharrio> YEAH! ONE PIECE!
[3:50:21] <%Ya_Boi_AD> EVEN FAIRY TAIL HAS BETTER DESIGNS
[3:50:21] <Doodle_Taco> Ath the beggining it did
[3:50:21] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> DOROHEDORO FUCKERS
[3:50:21] <evilaltruistic> What about HXH Woolie?
[3:50:21] <BlackermanZX> One piece wins
[3:50:22] <Niney_Who> One Piece characters get new outfits every arc too
[3:50:22] <%Ya_Boi_AD> SOMETIMES
[3:50:23] <+TruSanKyuu> Kubo should just do character design
[3:50:23] <andrei11dr> Oda is another one that's good at this
[3:50:24] <TheHoody> 4th hokages jacket tho
[3:50:24] <phatmac16> Agreed Woolie
[3:50:24] <NiktenKing> One Piece is too special
[3:50:24] <DaikiWithDaShot> One Piece is a good example
[3:50:25] <+Bluydee> BLEACH LUL
[3:50:25] <$Noponiz> one piece designs are megawild in a good way
[3:50:25] <%optimasmaximas> @dekkitout he's also lived for thousands of years, so of course he's got plenty of inspiration LUL
[3:50:25] <sonofthedeepsouth> REAS ALL OF ONE PIECE WOOLIE
[3:50:25] <%jiggy_snipe> idk Woolie you're probably wrong here
[3:50:25] <MAX116030> how? Bleach is fucking samurai
[3:50:25] <+Devouringabyss> The only think kubo had going for his was his art
[3:50:26] <+RaidenKyrielight> Bleach is WAY WORSE at the last arc Woolie
[3:50:26] <%DatAsuna> I can't follow you down this road
[3:50:27] <biomegabear> Woolie gets into bleach and oe piece
[3:50:28] <andrex2311> ONE ROCKS!
[3:50:28] <+tearknack> but it is the only thing you talk about lol
[3:50:28] <bigarmsnolegs> even the background characters in one piece all look different
[3:50:28] <%Exiliator> BLEACH DONTE EVEN HAVE BACKGROUND
[3:50:28] <+CoronetChris> ONE PIECE THO IS FOR REAL
[3:50:29] <Sp3ctre48> Kubo can't write but he's a great character designer
[3:50:29] <Alzero83> imo Jojo is terrible
[3:50:30] <foghornleghorn55> kubo is a better artist
[3:50:31] <CLINT_PEEPWOOD> Wtf are you talking about Woolie!!!!!
[3:50:31] <riderluc> you should
[3:50:32] <%Exiliator> LUL
[3:50:32] <Tropicalhazard> bleach have godlike character designs
[3:50:33] <bbHighvalor> BLEACH Kreygasm
[3:50:33] <nasubi_benjamin> It is an Invalid point
[3:50:33] <SON0ROUS> one peice designs are pretty cool
[3:50:33] <venomfury86> Demon Slayer is the coolest
[3:50:34] <+Taglog7> Kreygasm Bleach minimalism
[3:50:34] <gustavozxd> woolie comparing specific characters and people think he's comparing every naruto character here we go LUL
[3:50:34] <0rond> tite kubo's thing is character design, that's the thing he is good at
[3:50:34] <evilaltruistic> HXH Woolie!
[3:50:37] <townzzzzz> bleach had to sacrifice background tho
[3:50:37] <+NarcissistCactus> nah unpause it
[3:50:38] <%jiggy_snipe> its a basic uniform
[3:50:38] <+TiddlywinkUmbry> Bleach's backgrounds suffer as a result
[3:50:39] <ThePimpGuin> did some moron actually type bleach is worse?
[3:50:39] <Mahbonk> One Piece has a lot and lots of variety for sure
[3:50:40] <%Weeewer> HXH too
[3:50:40] <+ultimafullmetal> Most One Piece women look the same though
[3:50:40] <+myhandsareblank> Yeah in-universe it makes sense
[3:50:41] <%ECRead> DOROHEDORO
[3:50:48] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @jiggy_snipe I'm not sure, all I know is I played this through last week and it fucking chugged
[3:50:52] <C4m3r0n0409> HXH is worse
[3:50:52] <masterfire23> that was just so kishi had to draw less
[3:50:52] <DaikiWithDaShot> One Piece is also shonens but is a great example of having interesting designs, even if they're a little goofy
[3:50:54] <+TheDankDemon> THE HEART
[3:50:54] <%ChoculaUltra> We're talking about character design - bringing up Kubo not doing background art is literally missing the point.
[3:50:54] <giogio346> bleach is MUCH better in terms of character designs. wtf are you all on about LUL
[3:50:55] <glass_marcus> kubo is a min maxer. it's ok tho
[3:50:56] <Arek_1> @WoolieVersus That's the thing, the anime studio simplifies it. Just 'cuz the clothing may be a bit more basic, doesn't mean the shading can't be nice looking.
[3:50:56] <arran_throttle> @Sokumotanaka well, maybe they shouldn't put such section into the game in the first place, if they can't program it proper, but whatever
[3:50:56] <%Weeewer> Oda has gotten much better with female designs, and at least theyve always had good clothes
[3:50:57] <%nintega010> @ultimafullmetal until you get to amazon lily
[3:50:58] <0rond> dragon ball does it too though
[3:50:58] <CozyGUNNA> dorohedoro has amazing character designs
[3:51:00] <lotharrio> @ultimafullmetal Only the hot ones.
[3:51:01] <+IsaiahOmega> yo you should try One Piece tho. It's long but it's good. Kinda like JoJo
[3:51:01] <VidulaSaix> Sure, but that's what you're using as a comparison so you have to understand that when you say it like that it sounds like you're saying that other design sucks because it's not as detailed as JoJo
[3:51:02] <Alzero83> no its not
[3:51:05] <%Exiliator> Dorohedoro! Now THATS some good stuff!
[3:51:05] <Alzero83> Jojo is lame
[3:51:06] <0rond> what about dragon ball?
[3:51:06] <+SatsumaVA> But it was easier to draw, that's the main point
[3:51:07] <SON0ROUS> his newer one looks super dope in comparison
[3:51:08] <+GreenCMD> @ecread Based Dorohedoro mention
[3:51:08] <%Will9099> Dorohedoro is sick
[3:51:10] <+paladinstarbuster> no you cant
[3:51:11] <%Ya_Boi_AD> OH MAN TEAM 7
[3:51:11] <+Jake_Protagonist> they used to have headbands in an unique location
[3:51:12] <%Fujiwara_92> it really isn't, but ok
[3:51:12] <dekkitout> Does Jojo have big crowd fights?
[3:51:12] <HollowMan190> NoDombtNoDombtNoDombt
[3:51:13] <Shishi1205> Shut up Alzero LUL
[3:51:14] <+Bluydee> kishimoto made his designs simpler so he could put more detail into the art at this point of the manga
[3:51:14] <%optimasmaximas> LUL reggie
[3:51:14] <$Noponiz> @C4m3r0n0409 agreed. HxH does a lot right but the designs are the worst of any popular shonen
[3:51:14] <%Ya_Boi_AD> TEAM 7 TEAM UP
[3:51:14] <%Weeewer> Black Maria UUUNF
[3:51:15] <%heroversusofficial> Sakuras involved

[3:51:33] <CozyGUNNA> @noponiz disgagree
[3:51:33] <%DashXero> I've never looked at a JoJo character and thought "I want to wear that."

[3:51:36] <+NWannabe> they love saying destroy
[3:51:36] <+Taglog7> psaLiz animeeeeeeee

[3:52:02] <Leonheart777> They love destroying things LUL
[3:52:02] <lotharrio> It's fitting that Better Woolie is doing a catch-up of One Piece and loving it, While Woolie is trying to catch up to Naruto and hating it more and more.

[3:52:30] <%nintega010> @WoolieVersus when you make Naruto and Sasuke gods every character becomes useless.

[3:53:02] <lotharrio> @CommanderSqueaks Both are entertaining for me. But for Woolie's enjoyment, he'd probably want to play something that isn't hurting him.

[3:53:28] <0rond> I don't think the team attack will be unique, what would be the team attack is the QTE after the fight
[3:53:29] <%Lion_kun> Lion_kun subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months, currently on a 17 month streak! After you're done with this NUNS nonsense, any interest in getting into One Piece? if not via the manga then maybe via an LP. Sadly your choice is limited to Pirate Warriors 3 and 4. I wish One Piece had games like the Storm games.

[4:02:28] <%Fujiwara_92> there's a ninja heaven
[4:02:28] <BallerSwagBro9k> WRONG
[4:02:28] <+Bluydee> there's an afterlife but you can't see the present
[4:02:29] <Arek_1> Remember Kakashi meeting his dad in death?
[4:02:29] <%coreyyotto> There's a ninja heaven where eyehacks and fuckery doesn't exist and you just get to be an actual ninja
[4:02:30] <%Will9099> You appear in the clouds like a jojo ghost
[4:02:34] <%oscar_m510> Yeah
[4:02:35] <KidKaiser23> Ninja Heaven is called The Blessed Lands, they actually talk about it later in this game
[4:02:36] <VidulaSaix> I agree Woolie, that's how I always saw it
[4:02:37] <%perfectsalami> As i understand it, your chakra goes to an afterlife unless you put it somewhere else or its gets forced back
[4:02:37] <%DashXero> Black out until reanimation.
[4:02:38] <MAX116030> Kakashi met his father while being dead
[4:02:38] <rocketopaunch> cept for kakashi
[4:02:38] <BallerSwagBro9k> Theres an afterlife
[4:02:38] <transporterthesequel> Lifestream until full death
[4:02:39] <Shishi1205> I think so
[4:02:40] <%mankeyfigh> There’s a spirit world that we don’t EVER fucking talk about
[4:02:42] <rubbishbinge> Kakashi's dad was in purgatory for a bit
[4:02:42] <nepwar> where did kakashi's dad go
[4:02:43] <ahairysuprise> Yeah
[4:02:44] <LilacKing> They show with the white fang there is afterlife
[4:02:45] <Dragonfame> Can you guys stop bringing up kingdom hearts not everything is kh related , is kingdom hearts the only complex game you ever played
[4:02:45] <NiktenKing> Kakashi met his dad
[4:02:46] <+amiroodude> Or sealed into a baby
[4:02:46] <%MyNameIsRasus> That's how i saw it too
[4:02:47] <%jiggy_snipe> @ChoculaUltra Woolie cares about weird things like this
[4:02:48] <sunwraith91> Yeah thats it
[4:02:49] <%oscar_m510> that's how it worked for Deidara
[4:02:49] <+paladinstarbuster> ninja lifestream
[4:02:49] <+Ether101_Prime> But Kakashi and his dad.
[4:02:50] <Nekros4442> There's an afterlife. Kakashi saw his dad when he died
[4:02:51] <SON0ROUS> kakashi talks to his dad tho @WoolieVersus
[4:02:52] <foghornleghorn55> we know the afterlife exists in Naruto. remeber kakashi meeting his dad in purgatory
[4:02:52] <Shishi1205> Oh yeah Kakashis dad
[4:02:52] <+greenfall> jojo has canon heaven
[4:02:53] <%Robot_Nixon_> distStudy we die if we are killed
[4:02:53] <CozyGUNNA> kakashis death explains this
[4:02:55] <andrei11dr> It seems to be Hindu rulers with reincarnation
[4:02:55] <dekkitout> Wait- there might be an afterlife....
[4:02:57] <%gatorafan> The Will of Fire was Soul Society all along Kappa
[4:02:57] <lotharrio> Kakashi's dad DID get to wait for a chance to talk to Kakashi.
[4:02:57] <%Binary_Fireball> Im a ghoooost biiittttccchhh
[4:02:57] <Belutima> There is an afterlife, woopsISee they just dont show it in the game
[4:02:58] <%Exiliator> There is a ninja afterlife
[4:02:59] <CrazyMedicine> There's a Ninja Limbo too
[4:02:59] <Amardeux> reggie look like he got answers LUL
[4:02:59] <%Weeewer> I think woolie is right
[4:02:59] <irfan_> yo can we go back to dokapon
[4:03:00] <NiktenKing> Before he was Rinnerebirthed
[4:03:00] <%heroversusofficial> There's a two-phase type thing. You have a purgatory and then the other side.
[4:03:00] <KidKaiser23> Edo Tensei pulls you out of the Blessed Lands
[4:03:01] <releasetherats> Kakashi was in limbo when he met his dad
[4:03:02] <Sokumotanaka> Obito and rin literally walk off into the afterlife there is an aterlife
[4:03:02] <Diana869> 8 one guys left
[4:03:03] <T_Sasquatch> Just google it LMAO
[4:03:03] <sunwraith91> he's not wrong
[4:03:04] <venomfury86> Kakashi's dad
[4:03:04] <phatmac16> Kakashi talks to his death in the after life
[4:03:05] <%fetrigon> @wicketpelican Thanks for the clip!
[4:03:05] <gustavozxd> thought he was talking about jojo for a second
[4:03:05] <Animorphimagi> Kakashi DAD
[4:03:05] <%CommanderSqueaks> Ninja afterlife exists.
[4:03:06] <MAX116030> Woolie Kakashi met DAD
[4:03:07] <BlackermanZX> Kakashi met his dad in limbo
[4:03:07] <+LUN4RKiD> Kakashi died and met his dad
[4:03:07] <BallerSwagBro9k> WRONG
[4:03:07] <Nekros4442> Kakashi talks to his dad when he died
[4:03:08] <+Ether101_Prime> Then there's Rin waiting for Obito.
[4:03:10] <rubbishbinge> Chakra is force ghosts too
[4:03:12] <+Bluydee> there's an afterlife but it's a very abstract
[4:03:12] <lunacys_straightjacket> kakashi dad tho
[4:03:14] <%oscar_m510> Deidara didn't know he was dead and thought he killed Sasuske
[4:03:15] <Psykoknight65> There's an afterlife, Kakashi saw his dad their in the pain Arc
[4:03:17] <muniea3> chakra force ghosts
[4:03:19] <+wicketpelican> @fetrigon you're welcome!
[4:03:20] <%Weeewer> Oh the Minato thing is complete bull shit
[4:03:22] <%Robot_Nixon_> distThink
[4:03:24] <%Weeewer> Not worth thinking about
[4:03:25] <%DensityD> psaWrong
[4:03:26] <+OddityOn> Why don't you guys just google it for the answer then discuss it?
[4:03:27] <evilaltruistic> What happened to Rin again?
[4:03:27] <mrblack499> ghost are a thing?
[4:03:27] <black_pariah> theres an explicit named afterlife
[4:03:28] <Shishi1205> He gets sealed
[4:03:30] <VidulaSaix> @WoolieVersus We do know that the conciousness comes to an end because the Minato met when Naruto went 9 tails during the Pain fight isn't the same Minato that got Edo Tensei'd. They don't share that experience
[4:03:31] <Doodle_Taco> Just don't think about it
[4:03:31] <Ultzerostar00> He was sealed inside the reaper thing
[4:03:33] <KidKaiser23> There’s an Afterlife and you can use your Chakra to leave “notes”
[4:03:34] <+Bluydee> Minato's soul was sealed in the Reaper
[4:03:35] <%legacy0117> See ya guys. Naruto ended with Ninja space aliens and spirit kai battles.
[4:03:35] <Alzero83> Reggie, I appreciate that you dont halt the stream like this s often

[4:04:01] <rubbishbinge> Kurama agreed to give Minato his power
[4:04:01] <SSBBfan666> being sealed in the Shinigami has you facing your opponent endlessly

[4:04:10] <bunnyscruff> The Minato thing is where I gave up on the show,
[4:04:10] <Arek_1> Minato is just a prodigy, duh. LUL
[4:04:11] <lotharrio> He... was conscious, sealed in Naruto, and had nothing to do but talk and train with his Kyubi?
[4:04:11] <C4m3r0n0409> DONT THINK ABOUT IT
[4:04:12] <Plugman86> Minato's just a chad

[4:04:16] <Camail> HOKAGE GOOD CHAKRA BOY
[4:04:16] <Augus7717> minato and the kyubi were sealed inside the reapers stomach and from the look of it time passes while you are in there @WoolieVersus
[4:04:17] <andrei11dr> NO SHUT THO LUL
[4:04:17] <Sokumotanaka> The character who got done dirty the most in hayate's girl friene who literally just disappears before the war starts and we never see her again
[4:04:19] <nasubi_benjamin> @WoolieVersus Why didn't Dio use his eye laser beam in Part 3 ?
[4:04:20] <+bizzer10> they called him yellow flash bro
[4:04:20] <%perfectsalami> I think minato specifically did a reaper death seal on the fox, which makes your soul go into a fight for eternity
[4:04:24] <C4m3r0n0409> DON'T THINK ABOUT IT THOOO
[4:04:24] <%mankeyfigh> HES JUST AN OG
[4:04:24] <%jiggy_snipe> Minato is a really smart ninja like super smart
[4:04:24] <rubbishbinge> Naruto trained to forcefully take Kurama's power
[4:04:26] <Animorphimagi> Minato has space time kunai bruh
[4:04:29] <Doodle_Taco> besr shinobi of tbe world
[4:04:30] <0rond> it's not mastering the kyubi chakra
[4:04:32] <NiktenKing> He's a genius
[4:04:32] <%Robot_Nixon_> NotLikeThis how will woolie recover post naruto
[4:04:32] <+LUN4RKiD> LMAOO
[4:04:32] <Aracon_> LOL
[4:04:32] <Kira2993> SHUT UP THO
[4:04:33] <%oscar_m510> my opinion is that he is inside the Reaper with Kurama and they are stocked inside the reaper
[4:04:35] <sonofthedeepsouth> STOP THINKING WOOLIE
[4:04:36] <%perfectsalami> so technically his "soul" was fighting for 15 years
[4:04:36] <0rond> the kyubi mode is natural, every jinchuriiki does that when the beast's chakra leaks out
[4:04:36] <wendigo172> They were in the Reapers stomach
[4:04:36] <KidKaiser23> Minato learned ALL of the Uzumaki Clan Moves ONLY because he loved Kushina, the boy can hustle
[4:04:37] <%jiggy_snipe> HE'S A GENIUS SHUT UP
[4:04:38] <sunwraith91> @Woolieversus HE DESIGNED THE SEAL!
[4:04:39] <+Brandonxman> He's just that good
[4:04:41] <Idon__> "Eventually.... Woolie stopped thinking."
[4:04:41] <Shishi1205> YES
[4:04:42] <+PhantomMiG> @woolieversus Minato soul was eaten by the death god were he was tortured in the stomach fighting for eternity
[4:04:42] <%Solidnick18> don't ask questions
[4:04:42] <andrei11dr> He's really stronk
[4:04:43] <%Exiliator> Because Minato was working with Kushina who had the kyuubi, he probably was working on it before he died or something
[4:04:43] <DaBigVitus> Woolie is Kars
[4:04:44] <%Weeewer> G E N I U S
[4:04:44] <NotHereToStream> DON'T ASK QUESTIONS, JUST ACCEPT
[4:04:44] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Kishimoto didnt think about it, WHY SHOULD YOU
[4:04:44] <foghornleghorn55> he couldn't even learn sage mode lol
[4:04:45] <Hellarussian> why didnt the eagles just fly to Mordor?
[4:04:45] <%jiggy_snipe> YEP

[4:04:47] <%gatorafan> Minato can because he's cool Kappa
[4:04:48] <mrblack499> The "Rage" is the best part of this lol
[4:04:48] <Plugman86> yes, basically
[4:04:48] <sonofthedeepsouth> HE BE A CHAD
[4:04:49] <%insomniacCoder> madara could understand new abilities and getting out of edo tense
[4:04:52] <+bizzer10> shup up tho
[4:04:52] <Ultimatefool> GENIUS MINUMBO
[4:04:53] <%generalve> DONT WOORY ABOUT IT - Kishimoto
[4:04:53] <+OddityOn> @woolieversus He was inside the reaper death seal
[4:04:54] <phatmac16> HE'S A CHAD
[4:04:55] <Zbyrd0961> also kurama was willing this time
[4:04:56] <Alzero83> No Shuddup, Ninja Magic
[4:04:58] <vincerocmm> 1n th3 /3a93 d3ath s3al ?
[4:04:58] <%Solidnick18> The more you think the dumber it is
[4:04:58] <%nintega010> @Robot_Nixon_ read One Piece or finish bleach
[4:05:00] <andrei11dr> ULTIMATE CHAD
[4:05:02] <Deadbulky> Also the kyubi has to agree to that form!
[4:05:03] <+amiroodude> From minatos chakra in narutos belly
[4:05:03] <+Bluydee> The Kyuubi Chakra Mode only needs Kurama to give the go ahead
[4:05:04] <Mahbonk> LUL
[4:05:04] <Daba_mk2> Does minato remember when he talk with naruto inside naruto's spirit ?
[4:05:05] <+NarcissistCactus> kishimoto is just that good
[4:05:05] <rubbishbinge> CONSENSUAL POWER SHARING
[4:05:05] <+Ether101_Prime> Naruto's dad was inside the stomach this whole time.
[4:05:06] <bunnyscruff> Also why does he keep the second nine tails after dying?
[4:05:07] <Hellarussian> why didnt the eagles just fly Naruto to Mordor?
[4:05:08] <+hawk_rush> it's super super "dont' think about it"
[4:05:10] <%jiggy_snipe> Naruto sucks compared to his dad tho
[4:05:10] <Jetsfantasy> GENIUS MINATO
[4:05:11] <Doodle_Taco> BUT WHAT ABIUT THE WATERFALL
[4:05:12] <@Solidus_113> Naruto is also garbage at everything
[4:05:13] <Itsjsmithbubble> He too good
[4:05:14] <%mankeyfigh> PLOT HOLE
[4:05:15] <+RaidenKyrielight> After many edgy AMVs
[4:05:17] <ilpeggiore_> naruto was an idiot THO
[4:05:17] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:05:18] <+Bluydee> Naruto's training was to let him do it without Kurama taking over
[4:05:18] <rubbishbinge> No, he had to force the chakra out of Kurama
[4:05:18] <Belutima> You dont master Kyubi Chakra .The Tailed Beast Gives it to you or NOT woopsISee Mastering it Forced taking of the Kyubi power
[4:05:18] <Lysdexic9541> @woolieversus He was in the Reaper’s stomach. He still had his consciousness
[4:05:19] <%Jetzord> Ninja Heaven offers supplemental training courses for those interested
[4:05:19] <venomfury86> i was also confused about that
[4:05:19] <SON0ROUS> the same way Madara knows that two comet technique
[4:05:19] <%Fujiwara_92> GENIUS MINATO
[4:05:20] <+LUN4RKiD> duh waterfall
[4:05:20] <Doodle_Taco> ISNT THAT A REQUIREMNET?
[4:05:20] <%jiggy_snipe> Naruto is canonicaly a moron
[4:05:20] <+Ether101_Prime> Actually they said that there's an after life with that stuff too.
[4:05:21] <Nekros4442> I dont get why they ask these questions and dont look to chat for answers
[4:05:21] <Shishi1205> @bunnyscruff He seals it with him
[4:05:23] <tusk_act4> @WoolieVersus According to the wiki "Unlike most tailed beasts, the Nine-Tails offered no resistance to cooperating with Minato, granting him immediate access to Nine-Tails Chakra Mode, which impressed all spectators"
[4:05:23] <%DensityD> persona
[4:05:24] <C4m3r0n0409> Naruto did it in a day right
[4:05:24] <phatmac16> PLOT HOLE
[4:05:26] <+paladinstarbuster> minato knew all that though
[4:05:26] <+MrRabbles> GENIUS MINATO does it again
[4:05:26] <%Will9099> and all the tailed forms
[4:05:27] <%Reverend_Roscoe> KURUMA IS A CAR
[4:05:28] <eatmcdonalds> It Just need befriending
[4:05:28] <Animorphimagi> Naruto IS A CHILD
[4:05:28] <+ineek10> his wife was a jinkuriki maybe thats how
[4:05:29] <%Kriss1827> remember naruto sucks ass
[4:05:29] <%Irridium> Minato was doing a speedrun @WoolieVersus
[4:05:32] <%Robot_Nixon_> @nintega010 is OP a stable palette cleanser?
[4:05:32] <%insomniacCoder> but narotu is an idiot
[4:05:34] <gustavozxd> Boruto
[4:05:34] <%bread_assassin> Maybe they're all conscious in the Reaper Death Seal.
[4:05:35] <sunwraith91> @WoolieVersus Mintao created the whole dang thing!
[4:05:36] <+LUN4RKiD> The right place is death i guess
[4:05:38] <fraudulentcheddar> they were sealed inside the death god, not dead
[4:05:39] <Arblaster_> The whole facing fears was just an excuse for a powerup anyway
[4:05:39] <%CommanderSqueaks> Yeah, but Naruto is a moron, Minato isn't.
[4:05:40] <%Exiliator> @WoolieVersus The first thing that naruto's spriit mom does is show naruto how to take it by force right?
[4:05:40] <dekkitout> And he had yin ninetails
[4:05:40] <VidulaSaix> @WoolieVersus I think it's implied that the Minato that was sealed within the Reaper Death God was in a continuous conciousness, and this is the Minato that Orochimaru dragged out of the Death God because remember Minato didn't technically "die" there he was sealed within the Death God. Same as the 3rd Hokage.
[4:05:45] <fist_wizard_jay> Ok but what about Kinkaku and Ginkaku too?
[4:05:45] <0rond> there's nothing to solve or master it's just what happens when you use the chakra, naruto had to fight the kyuubi to get it, not learn the skill, if kyubi hadn't fought him it wouldn't have been an issue
[4:05:45] <fraudulentcheddar> they were probably fighting for the last 15 years
[4:05:46] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> GENIUS MINAMBO
[4:05:48] <%jiggy_snipe> is Woolie actually comparing Naruto (Moron) to his dad (Genius)?
[4:05:52] <+ezrrajyock> wha
[4:05:55] <andrei11dr> You mean Borutos dad ? Kappa
[4:05:56] <+OddityOn> read chat
[4:05:56] <vincerocmm> svv1ng
[4:05:58] <+tearknack> @WoolieVersus it doens't literally repeat itself, its a genjutsu woolie
[4:06:00] <Nekros4442> I think it's implied that the Minato that was sealed within the Reaper Death God was in a continuous conciousness, and this is the Minato that Orochimaru dragged out of the Death God because remember Minato didn't technically "die" there he was sealed within the Death God. Same as the 3rd Hokage.
[4:06:00] <+TheSnake303> maybe minato knew how it works from kushina
[4:06:00] <Deadbulky> But kurama is also a person not an item Woolie, he has to do the same with minato
[4:06:00] <Itsjsmithbubble> Minato’s genes skipped Naruto and went straight to Bort and Hima
[4:06:00] <+Bluydee> woolie please read the chat
[4:06:01] <%jiggy_snipe> GENIUS MINAMBO LUL
[4:06:01] <KidKaiser23> @jiggy_snipe He’s breaking down
[4:06:06] <tusk_act4> According to the wiki "Unlike most tailed beasts, the Nine-Tails offered no resistance to cooperating with Minato, granting him immediate access to Nine-Tails Chakra Mode, which impressed all spectators"
[4:06:08] <%optimasmaximas> @Exiliator minh never said they did outright, he kinda just waved it off, but then he juggled whether or not it was covered after woolie questioned it and reggie said maybe, then minh said maybe, and then mentioned a 10 second clip, which still wasn't accurate, because it is explained as the yin yang thing reggie mentioned, and i thought you were agreeing that minh was right that they never talked about it
[4:06:11] <+Ether101_Prime> When they stated that Manato was in the belly of the God of Death they infered that there's an after life.
[4:06:12] <nasubi_benjamin> It's like a nen condition woolie
[4:06:12] <sunwraith91> @Itsjsmithbubble thats true
[4:06:12] <gustavozxd> GENIUS MINAMBO
[4:06:13] <+tearknack> @WoolieVersus woolie, izanami is a genjutsu
[4:06:15] <%heroversusofficial> I didn't realize you had to learn how to be given power
[4:06:17] <@Moobot> Easy with the emojis @masterfire23
[4:06:17] <Picosunloaded> @woolieversus remember when kakashi talked to his dad in heaven
[4:06:17] <andrei11dr> STRAIGHT MAGIC
[4:06:19] <bunnyscruff> @shishi1205 Boruto's grandad is fucking bullshit
[4:06:20] <Fetty_Krill> At the end of the day Kishimoto just gave up
[4:06:21] <%nintega010> @Robot_Nixon_ if he wants something good or it might make him mad cause Naruto isn't One Piece. But all in all it depends if he likes it
[4:06:21] <%oscar_m510> but honestly Kishimoto never talked about this
[4:06:27] <Shishi1205> yes
[4:06:27] <%optimasmaximas> @Exiliator so i misunderstood you a bit is what im gathering?
[4:06:29] <sunwraith91> It's an illusion
[4:06:31] <+tearknack> its an illusion
[4:06:33] <Nekros4442> I think it's implied that the Minato that was sealed within the Reaper Death God was in a continuous conciousness, and this is the Minato that Orochimaru dragged out of the Death God because remember Minato didn't technically "die" there he was sealed within the Death God. Same as the 3rd Hokage.
[4:06:41] <dekkitout> Become brainwashed
[4:06:44] <0rond> you face yourself
[4:06:45] <C4m3r0n0409> YEP
[4:06:45] <Psykoknight65> you don't
[4:06:45] <VidulaSaix> Pretty much
[4:06:46] <+tearknack> yeah, but its not reality repeating itself
[4:06:46] <WarKamex> accept reality
[4:06:48] <Shishi1205> Brainwash no jutsu
[4:06:48] <%JetpackMcQuack> :monkaW
[4:06:50] <%Exiliator> @optimasmaximas yes
[4:06:50] <rubbishbinge> ye
[4:06:51] <0rond> you need to accept reality
[4:06:52] <Deadbulky> No not change ur way of thinking, its accept yourself and reality
[4:06:52] <KidKaiser23> Never once have I ever wished to be in a room so bad lmao
[4:06:52] <skewerstar> So Naruto is a David Cage Manga?
[4:06:54] <CLINT_PEEPWOOD> it's basically brainwashing
[4:06:55] <%Fujiwara_92> you face yourself, like persona LUL
[4:06:55] <%nintega010> Also is the next part the final sasuke and Naruto fight
[4:06:55] <%ggbhtg> GET CONFUSED yes
[4:06:56] <+tearknack> yes? we never argued against that
[4:06:57] <andrei11dr> Ummm
[4:06:57] <VidulaSaix> Accepting reality, changing who you are
[4:06:57] <DaBigVitus> kurama has to agree to be mastered?
[4:07:00] <Zeemod155> The point of the illusion ISNT to be able to get out, it's to trap you forever
[4:07:00] <phatmac16> it's just persona 4
[4:07:04] <%oscar_m510> maybe it's a placebo effect?
[4:07:05] <+ultimafullmetal> Or you don't and die eventually I guess
[4:07:06] <%gunsrlove> You break the illusion by being outside of the 11-14 age male group Kappa Kappa
[4:07:06] <%DensityD> NotLikeThis
[4:07:09] <+LUN4RKiD> get confused get confused
[4:07:09] <%LanceCorpralScottBukake> Through bullshit
[4:07:10] <dekkitout> Change your way- according to who(m)?
[4:07:10] <NiktenKing> You need to accept LITERAL reality not figurative
[4:07:10] <%CommanderSqueaks> Accept your shadow, the true self.
[4:07:10] <CozyGUNNA> @skewerstar yup
[4:07:12] <austinj24> POV no Justu
[4:07:12] <Amardeux> its just persona 4 lmao
[4:07:12] <%Exiliator> brainwashing
[4:07:12] <Sokumotanaka> You do that and dont get a stand or persona? WACK
[4:07:12] <+Gutsandlove> PERSONA
[4:07:13] <gustavozxd> nah woolie you're always wrong, that's the facts chat told me
[4:07:13] <0rond> yes
[4:07:14] <Kira2993> just like PERSONA 4
[4:07:16] <+hawk_rush> @gunsrlove yep LUL

[4:07:18] <%JetpackMcQuack> yes
[4:07:19] <%Robot_Nixon_> @nintega010 you're right I havent even read up on it. But a good suggestion
[4:07:19] <%Will9099> infinite brainwash hell no jutsu
[4:07:19] <+greenfall> change my mind hard counter
[4:07:20] <+LandOfTheWay> @WoolieVersus i think it's Persona 4 rules?
[4:07:20] <%DarkNerdShawny> chat is wrong?
[4:07:21] <BlackermanZX> Character development no jutsu
[4:07:22] <%jiggy_snipe> @tusk_act4 that's an explanation or Minato is just really good at stuff
[4:07:23] <venomfury86> accept yourself
[4:07:23] <sunwraith91> Oh, no. You accept reality, period.
[4:07:23] <+OddityOn> it's not brainwash
[4:07:24] <SON0ROUS> universal truth Kappa
[4:07:24] <0rond> you can't make someone think what you want
[4:07:26] <+ineek10> belive me wolls kishimoto didnt put much thought into it
[4:07:26] <Arek_1> @WoolieVersus Minato only had the Nine-Tails Chakra Mode, not Kurama Mode. For the former, you only have to win the tug-of-war. The latter needs Kurama's consent.
[4:07:26] <fangovafang> ugh..
[4:07:27] <Ivokki> So it's like a bad trip on shrooms?
[4:07:29] <%eyezehuhh> @gunsrlove LUL
[4:07:30] <nasubi_benjamin> @WoolieVersus I still don't get your problem with Izanami ? You're so bad at explaining yourself
[4:07:30] <crossing_mao> NotLikeThis BabyRage ResidentSleeper
[4:07:33] <Shishi1205> And meets his dad
[4:07:34] <sunwraith91> yeah that bullshit
[4:07:35] <%Exiliator> well not brainwashing as in you know, the usual kind
[4:07:37] <+hawk_rush> yep
[4:07:37] <+LUN4RKiD> No straight up died
[4:07:38] <C4m3r0n0409> YUP
[4:07:38] <transporterthesequel> Izanami is actually really easy to get out of, it’s specifically anti-Izanagi tech. The solution is to literally stop doing anything, which Izanagi users try and spam Izanagi to get out if the situation
[4:07:39] <andrei11dr> mi head hurts
[4:07:41] <%Fujiwara_92> SO THERE'S A AFTERLIFE
[4:07:42] <+VGGary> Remember Minato met Naruto when Naruto pulled off the nine tails seal?
[4:07:42] <dekkitout> Fuck that- Kashi was DEAD
[4:07:43] <C4m3r0n0409> HE DIED

[4:07:51] <+hawk_rush> Don't worry about it Kappa
[4:07:52] <Amardeux> it was real
[4:07:52] <venomfury86> yes
[4:07:52] <Mahbonk> last second vision ?
[4:07:54] <sunwraith91> Oh no he died
[4:07:54] <+OddityOn> IT WAS REAL.
[4:07:55] <+amiroodude> uncleaer

[4:07:56] <%jiggy_snipe> i think that was real
[4:07:56] <ghoulspan> HE WAS IN LIMBO
[4:07:57] <releasetherats> he was in limbo
[4:07:58] <C4m3r0n0409> HE DIED
[4:08:00] <+LUN4RKiD> nooo he straight up died right then
[4:08:01] <Jane_Lo> it was real, they alter flashback to it
[4:08:02] <%Exiliator> He died!
[4:08:02] <staticshock5> @woolieversus He remembers meeting his dad.
[4:08:04] <fraudulentcheddar> there's an afterlife, people who edo tensei'd don't remember it
[4:08:05] <Plugman86> oh yeah, it could be a Bojack near death thing
[4:08:06] <KidKaiser23> It’s real, he died! Kakashi remembers it
[4:08:06] <ilpeggiore_> what the hell are they talking about
[4:08:07] <black_pariah> there's an explicit named afterlife
[4:08:09] <%heroversusofficial> Kakashi 100% died. Confirmed by naruto when he arrived.
[4:08:09] <DaBigVitus> this is some buuuullshit
[4:08:10] <SON0ROUS> KOJIMA does it AGAIN
[4:08:10] <foghornleghorn55> yes he does. he implies he did when talking to Naruto after the pain arc
[4:08:12] <+Zanco23> You see Obito in the afterlife in the anime
[4:08:12] <Brutalyte616> You were implying that it was warping reality. You just phrased it poorly and chat had reservations.
[4:08:12] <CozyGUNNA> no he died
[4:08:13] <%coreyyotto> It could just be the brain imagining what the parent would say
[4:08:14] <+OddityOn> Kakashi died
[4:08:15] <%Fujiwara_92> KAKASHI LEGIT DIED
[4:08:16] <%mankeyfigh> HE STRAIGHT UP DIED
[4:08:21] <digoquadros> no, he died
[4:08:23] <C4m3r0n0409> KAKASHI WAS DEAD
[4:08:25] <%oscar_m510> I mean well idk if his head made up that memory but he DOES remember talking with his father
[4:08:26] <sunwraith91> @WoolieVersus Kakashi was dead at the point, and literally came back to life
[4:08:26] <Dr_Servbot> zabuza said he woke up in a place away from haku
[4:08:27] <+Memitim> he died
[4:08:27] <Picosunloaded> None died and got resurrected @woolieversus
[4:08:28] <dekkitout> Kashi took a rod TO THE DOME
[4:08:29] <%DashXero> Kakashi super died.
[4:08:29] <MAX116030> Pain literally resurrects people

[4:08:35] <rubbishbinge> Kakashi had to be Rinne-Rebirthed

[4:08:37] <%heroversusofficial> Kakashi was 10000% dead
[4:08:37] <%Fujiwara_92> YES THAT DID HAPPEN
[4:08:38] <%jiggy_snipe> Pain resurrected a bunch of people
[4:08:39] <VidulaSaix> I personally think that was in his own head. A sort of near death experience kind of thing
[4:08:39] <phatmac16> yup

[4:09:59] <C4m3r0n0409> Sealed
[4:10:00] <Arek_1> @WoolieVersus Minato only had the Nine-Tails Chakra Mode, not Kurama Mode. For the former, you only have to win the tug-of-war. The latter needs Kurama's consent.
[4:10:01] <Idon__> trapped in the SHADOWREALM

[4:10:05] <+amiroodude> trapped in the shadow realm

[4:10:15] <%optimasmaximas> ginkaku and kinkaku were sealed but didnt die
[4:10:16] <rubbishbinge> Naruto trained to take Kurama's chakra by force.
[4:10:19] <+Bluydee> it's not hard at all the Kyuubi just needs to give consent for the Kyuubi Chakra Mode

[4:14:28] <%Thorlias> snailNUNS
[4:14:28] <%Exiliator> Weve already established chakra ghosts
[4:14:30] <%mankeyfigh> Chakra ghost
[4:14:31] <HungryHungryEmu> Minato did it

[4:14:41] <Belutima> Sage Chakra Force Ghost
[4:14:41] <+Jake_Protagonist> @WoolieVersus It's better to think as Kaguya as an Alien rather than God. A different species that has super powers or some lame stuff

[4:34:10] <+KilogramHours> Gaara is always rad
[4:34:11] <fairore> hxh is average
[4:34:14] <+Taglog7> The truest not the chosen one is Watamote

[4:34:38] <sunwraith91> OH god I remember that
[4:34:38] <+aishman> @WoolieVersus Everything we just saw further proofs that Rock Lee embodies everything Naruto preaches more than Naruto.
[4:34:42] <%DensityD> don't worry about it
[4:34:46] <Sokumotanaka> Elmo is Garra
[4:34:49] <+TheDyingPride> But can Gaara hop dimensions?
[4:34:50] <lotharrio> Want a shonen? Read Jujutsu Kaisen, end your lowly cowardice.
[4:34:51] <+LUN4RKiD> Sakura gave naruto CPR
[4:34:52] <%DensityD> so he killed some people, don't WORRY about IT
[4:34:55] <Alzero83> But thats Thansk to Naruto that Gaara becaome Good
[4:34:55] <Shishi1205> Lee in shipuden is so forgoten
[4:35:00] <%Fujiwara_92> ROCK LEE IS THE REAL NARUTO
[4:35:02] <+Bluydee> Gaara's there helping them fight in the final battl, the game just cut him out
[4:35:04] <%RioGascar> i dont know if my donation went through, i sent it before you started session but maybe it failed

[4:35:33] <Shishi1205> correct
[4:35:33] <%Fujiwara_92> LUL
[4:35:34] <Vikken141> its true
[4:35:34] <zenith0111> Rock Lee is just a trash Ninja and people love him because he reminds fans how trash they are Kappa
[4:35:34] <%ECRead> yeah no shit
[4:35:35] <Kira2993> i mean, it shows
[4:35:36] <rubbishbinge> lol
[4:35:37] <lotharrio> I've heard that.
[4:35:37] <%Sparkseid> yes
[4:35:38] <swervoxsage> why say it madara
[4:35:38] <tusk_act4> IT'S TRUE
[4:35:38] <andrei11dr> WTF LUL
[4:35:38] <%Irridium> YOU COULD HAVE HAD MIGHT GUY BEAT HIM
[4:35:39] <klonoakirb> oh yeah he did say that
[4:35:39] <%Fujiwara_92> that's true
[4:35:40] <%heroversusofficial> Truth
[4:35:40] <Sokumotanaka> that's true
[4:35:41] <%oscar_m510> I think that was urban legend thing
[4:35:41] <Isord> YEAH
[4:35:44] <%HostilePoundcakes> wow LUL
[4:35:46] <C4m3r0n0409> Pretty much
[4:35:47] <ThePimpGuin> @double_z_zzilm I said closest
[4:35:47] <%gatorafan> Someone HAS to send Woolie the Madara copy paste now
[4:35:47] <%ggbhtg> Tsuchikage got told off so hard, he had to work the hardest in the war after that
[4:35:47] <sunwraith91> @WoolieVersus You have to remember, originally this was about Wizards
[4:35:48] <venomfury86> it's true
[4:35:49] <rubbishbinge> Game content tho
[4:35:50] <KidKaiser23> He did say that
[4:35:50] <swervoxsage> is it hard to say it the right way ?
[4:35:54] <%jiggy_snipe> he let Madara become immortal
[4:35:54] <%coreyyotto> It's true that's what Kishi said, but it's not true that there were other ways to resolve the story
[4:35:57] <austinj24> Wait did he ever see the scene where Orichamru finds the Kage?
[4:35:59] <+hithereguy2> It true
[4:36:00] <KidKaiser23> Which is crazy cuz they were kicking his ass
[4:36:00] <Nixy_89> Madara was over powered
[4:36:03] <+IsaiahOmega> Guy could've just beat him Fuck off Kishi
[4:36:04] <+jdan93> jdan93 subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[4:36:04] <lovesosa236> than why make another villan that's even stronger?
[4:36:06] <%jiggy_snipe> should have tricked him into space Kappa
[4:36:07] <%Robot_Nixon_> Is there a character that could even possibly EVEN TOUCH Madara Uchiha?
[4:36:08] <%generalve> OP
[4:36:09] <+HenshinSupreme> The ending really didn't have fights in the manga
[4:36:10] <C4m3r0n0409> IT WAS LONGER IN SHOW
[4:36:11] <Arblaster_> The anime was even worse woolie
[4:36:19] <Sokumotanaka> So if naruto uses six paths and cums in hinata does the baby get god powers?
[4:36:19] <+Bluydee> the way they beat Kaguya could have just been the same way to beat Madara
[4:36:19] <%Irridium> Could have literally had Might Guy beat him
[4:36:20] <%Reverend_Roscoe> HE DID
[4:36:21] <GoldeNOVA> That's why the pasta exists
[4:36:21] <venomfury86> Madara was a mistake
[4:36:21] <+Caidezes> Kaguya was stronger though. lol
[4:36:21] <double_z_zzilm> there are ones that are more underdog
[4:36:22] <zenith0111> I love how fans are screaming for Night Guy to win even though it would completely ruin Narutos character LUL
[4:36:24] <LilacKing> @lovesosa236 Right?
[4:36:24] <%Reverend_Roscoe> THAT WAS THE BULLSHIT
[4:36:26] <biomegabear> just have Madara die by guy
[4:36:27] <rubbishbinge> MAdara was also a sage
[4:36:28] <+LUN4RKiD> lance of longinus
[4:36:29] <phatmac16> just have him kill night guy
[4:36:31] <swervoxsage> im dead yall saying his name the wrong way
[4:36:32] <+IsaiahOmega> Guy Stuffed him up that's bullshit
[4:36:36] <%jiggy_snipe> or just seal him or something
[4:36:42] <%vextalyst> OR GUY COULD'VE BEAT HIM
[4:36:44] <+KilogramHours> @WoolieVersus Swagbito is on the subreddit calling you out.
[4:36:45] <austinj24> Madara actually wins until Zetsu
[4:36:46] <NiktenKing> Naruto fights him as Pain, then with the army, then as Obito, then as Obito Sage, then Madara Sage, then perfect Madara Sage....
[4:36:47] <TheHoody> The game didn't show that Yamato was inside Guruguru
[4:36:47] <%oscar_m510> That's why I think it's more of an Internet meme than a thing he actually said or meant
[4:36:49] <ThePimpGuin> everyone thought those would be used on him!!!
[4:36:49] <%perfectsalami> thats strange because he bullshited kaguya. that woman came out of nowhere
[4:36:50] <NotHereToStream> just talk no jutsu him 4Head
[4:36:51] <%Robot_Nixon_> the copy pasta might make sense to woolie now
[4:36:52] <gustavozxd> that'd be alright
[4:36:56] <%Kriss1827> OR GUY COULDVE KILLED HIM
[4:36:56] <%Weeewer> honestly thats better
[4:36:56] <+TheDyingPride> I mean Guy almost did it with JUST KICKS
[4:36:58] <lotharrio> Just use the sealing pot to get him. Done.
[4:36:58] <%Fujiwara_92> OR GUY COULD'VE BEATEN HIM
[4:36:58] <andrei11dr> Just bullshit your way to victory like Joseph
[4:37:00] <+KilogramHours> @WoolieVersus Swagbito is calling you out on the subreddit.
[4:37:01] <VidulaSaix> Honestly the Kaguya stuff isn't TOTALLY out of nowhere when you look back on some thing, but it definitely was a last minute asspull thing. It's clear he looked back on his own series to try and find something he could use to try and end his manga
[4:37:02] <+Taglog7> Where did woolie and reggie go? Kappa
[4:37:02] <%jiggy_snipe> Guy wouldn't win after Madara attained immortality
[4:37:06] <bearwagon> LUL
[4:37:10] <KidKaiser23> Sage Tools and Taijustu should’ve been it
[4:37:20] <KidKaiser23> Woolie getting into his Plague Bag rn

[4:37:23] <Amardeux> LUL
[4:37:25] <gustavozxd> FeelsBadMan
[4:37:28] <gustavozxd> or yeah
[4:37:31] <+oda_flobunaga> Or he died of a heart attack
[4:37:31] <NeetKiller> But Space mom thou
[4:37:31] <+IsaiahOmega> Guy fucking beat him this is stupid
[4:37:33] <%perfectsalami> and its also also weird since madara commented that guy almost killed him, so unless night guy was just THAT good naruto and sasuke cold have believaby managed it
[4:37:33] <venomfury86> If Madara wasn't an reanimation, he would lose against Guy
[4:37:33] <+HenshinSupreme> no everything is one big bads fault
[4:37:34] <gustavozxd> REALLY HARD
[4:37:35] <DetroitSentai> But the main characters need to do the thing
[4:37:36] <+BubbaRands> Those are really hard punches

[4:37:58] <Sokumotanaka> I'm still mad guy didn't get his turtle version of sage mode and destroyed madera

[4:38:40] <mackumbopus> Kaguya didn't use her Byakugan at all.
[4:38:45] <KidKaiser23> Fun Fact is Naruto can’t see the limbo and only fights them off instinct
[4:38:46] <andrei11dr> It's really unimportant
[4:38:47] <%ChoculaUltra> isn't that the same fucking answer tho?!
[4:38:48] <C4m3r0n0409> NO IT WAS SPOILERS

[4:39:15] <+LUN4RKiD> yeah it did
[4:39:15] <Deadbulky> At the time it was spoilers cus u didnt know he had the renegan at the time
[4:39:17] <vincerocmm> vv1n
[4:39:20] <Nixy_89> The rinnegan is if you took the byakugan and shiringan put them together then put them on crack
[4:39:22] <%Fujiwara_92> actually you don't, but that was dumb
[4:39:23] <+Bluydee> You don't until Sasuke gets the rinnegan
[4:39:24] <+Taglog7> BUT KNOW EVERYTHING THO

[4:40:05] <%oscar_m510> the video game and the anime have the Reverse Harem
[4:40:06] <%DashXero> Game skipped it.
[4:40:10] <+NarcissistCactus> 😂 👌 🔥
[4:40:12] <lotharrio> @NWannabe It's optional as a super.
[4:40:13] <gappy22> they changed the art style

[4:40:15] <KidKaiser23> It’s Anime, and Canon
[4:40:16] <Arblaster_> The big fights have high budget
[4:40:16] <biomegabear> yeah its a big money moment
[4:40:18] <+NWannabe> wtf
[4:40:18] <irfan_> not really skipped, its narutos ult for the kaguya fight
[4:40:21] <DetroitSentai> wait the game skipped the reverse harem?

[4:59:11] <KidKaiser23> Sakura focused all her orgasms into her forehead for 5 years
[4:59:12] <rubbishbinge> Izanami is the direct counter
[4:59:13] <sunwraith91> Izanmi was created as a counter for Izanagi
[4:59:15] <biomegabear> interesting idea
[4:59:17] <%Djinnazz> i don't think so.
[4:59:18] <%Fujiwara_92> LUL
[4:59:18] <+Vikingdeath1> Tralse
[4:59:19] <%Reverend_Roscoe> IZANAMI IS HARD COUNTER
[4:59:20] <%krispen_wa> Izanami is literally the hard counter
[4:59:20] <%optimasmaximas> @zenith0111 ive never played a kingdom hearts game myself, so i dont know the specifics you're referring to, cause i do know plenty about the series, but what you speak of sounds to be beneath that layer of substance, so could you care to explain to me by what you mean?
[4:59:21] <$Noponiz> the entire point of izanamai is to beat izanagi
[4:59:21] <RiceeFTW> izanami is the direct counter
[4:59:22] <andrei11dr> NotLikeThis
[4:59:23] <+Caidezes> They explode.
[4:59:25] <+GenesisKnight> Izanami wins
[4:59:26] <%Reverend_Roscoe> CAN'T ESCAPE WITH IZANAGI
[4:59:28] <RiceeFTW> it's THE counter
[4:59:28] <Doodle_Taco> Izanami is a counter that makes no sense but still
[4:59:29] <Augus7717> izanami is the direct counter to izanagi
[4:59:29] <rubbishbinge> Izanami is pretty much useless on most people
[4:59:30] <%Exiliator> Yes, but they would waste it I think?
[4:59:31] <Arnoldoaad1> Well that was the whole point
[4:59:31] <%CommanderSqueaks> IZANAMI is hard counter.
[4:59:31] <Revicula> In the story its the counter
[4:59:32] <+NWannabe> why do naruto characters look so lame in boruto? (see shino)
[4:59:35] <ThenordicOz> Izanami is the hard counter
[4:59:36] <VidulaSaix> No because Izanami is the direct counter to Izanagi. Izanagi allows you to escape death, not a mind prison
[4:59:36] <austinj24> Izanami was hard counter
[4:59:41] <biomegabear> is this a jugernaut vs the blob?
[4:59:41] <KidKaiser23> Izanami is THE matchup
[4:59:42] <%jiggy_snipe> the matchup is 10-0
[4:59:49] <%Fujiwara_92> Izanami is the hard counter
[4:59:50] <%Reverend_Roscoe> YOU CAN'T IZANAGI OUT OF IZANAMI
[4:59:51] <+bluedude153> Who knows
[4:59:53] <%coreyyotto> Doesn't matter
[4:59:55] <333agus333> except izanami is also FUCKBUSTED
[4:59:56] <rubbishbinge> Izanami has no practical use outside of spanking Izanagi
[4:59:57] <+bluedude153> They never got into it
[4:59:59] <C4m3r0n0409> Doesnt matter
[5:00:03] <sunwraith91> Doesn't matter
[5:00:05] <%krispen_wa> If you know the person can use Izanagi, you use izanami
[5:00:05] <giogio346> sarada best girl :)
[5:00:05] <staticshock5> @nwannabe Because Boruto's designs are weak in general compared to Naruto and Shippuden.
[5:00:08] <%Fujiwara_92> doesn't matter
[5:00:09] <KidKaiser23> Doesn’t matter
[5:00:11] <T_Sasquatch> doesnt matter

[5:01:13] <RiceeFTW> Avatar 100% the way
[5:01:13] <+kyh9> @Solidus_113 Pretty good. I prefer Mob but OPM is better written than 90% of all shonen
[5:01:15] <overlord_nico> Ichigo gets the most stacks

[5:01:27] <$Noponiz> @Solidus_113 OPM is pretty solid. The anime and redraw get bad after a few arcs tho. Mob is god tier

[5:01:45] <+Bluydee> shonen is a fucking demographic to all the people who keep talking about it like a genre

[5:05:13] <T_Sasquatch> KSBD is beautiful
[5:05:14] <TheHoody> Hikaru No Go is the best no stack anime
[5:05:14] <Zayasu> Kappa
[5:05:16] <zenith0111> Love/Hate relationship
[5:05:19] <%Solidnick18> just the fights Kappa
[5:05:24] <+TheDyingPride> You can like it while still acknowledging it's fucking stupid
[5:05:28] <tookool5678> its still better than Harry Potter.
[5:05:33] <venomfury86> Fairy tail and Naruto have the same music composer
[5:05:34] <someyounguy1> naruto is a spoonful of icecream with a bowl full of sprinkles
[5:05:35] <@Solidus_113> you like the shounen battles, and not anything else
[5:05:37] <%generalve> BASED MINH
[5:05:39] <mrblack499> name in chat
[5:05:39] <%jiggy_snipe> Reggie leave
[5:05:40] <Nekros4442> You can like it and acknowledge that it's stupid
[5:05:40] <Arnoldoaad1> @RiceeFTW I guess you are right there, i skip the anime when they enter Hueco Mundo but did follow the manga
[5:05:42] <%ChoculaUltra> weren't these fools supposed to be going on break?!
[5:05:45] <Arblaster_> True
[5:05:45] <+GenesisKnight> There's a lot of bad parts though
[5:05:47] <klonoakirb> toriko is the best stack shounen because its stacks dont come out of nowhere
[5:05:47] <%Exiliator> Woolie I sent you a msg on twitter, I mssed up my dono
[5:05:48] <nepwar> the man is playing shinobi striker.
[5:05:51] <+oda_flobunaga> Good up till the chunin exam
[5:05:52] <Mahbonk> its still enjoyable. I mostly have nostalgia for it. But i moved on from it
[5:05:53] <%Weeewer> Naruto is like 50-60% good to great
[5:05:54] <VidulaSaix> @WoolieVersus Much like FF7R, even if the ending made you feel bad about it that doesn't mean the majority of the series that was pretty good makes the whole thing bad. That's how I see it
[5:06:02] <%ggbhtg> the parts I were awake for BLEW MY MIND
[5:06:04] <+Bluydee> people need to realize that these last few bullshit parts is the equivalent of 15 chapters in the manga
[5:06:04] <+Jake_Protagonist> Its hard not to like the powers yeah
[5:06:07] <Lysdexic9541> Through the good AND the bad, I love Naruto
[5:06:15] <lotharrio> Pain fight feels more conclusive.
[5:06:15] <%prime_name> Preach!
[5:06:15] <VidulaSaix> Exactly Reggie
[5:06:16] <masterfire23> minh is one of the few people that like shinobi strikers
[5:06:18] <rubbishbinge> Naruto is fun
[5:06:20] <%jiggy_snipe> yea Reggie
[5:06:20] <+TheDyingPride> True
[5:06:21] <Duke_of_HI> Love to Hate, Hate to Love
[5:06:22] <nasubi_benjamin> Hunter x Hunter is the Anti-stacks on stacks
[5:06:22] <nepwar> hey do you like simpsons if you don't like more than half of the show?
[5:06:23] <%jiggy_snipe> Naruto is dumb fun
[5:06:24] <Shishi1205> Big streches
[5:06:26] <C4m3r0n0409> @VidulaSaix Theres way more bad then good
[5:06:27] <%ggbhtg> I was asleep for most of it, but the parts I were awake for BLEW MY MIND
[5:06:30] <%Robot_Nixon_> nothing is sacred BibleThump
[5:06:31] <%oscar_m510> Despite all of this I still love Naruto and I'm glad I watched it
[5:06:33] <VidulaSaix> I disagree @C4m3r0n0409
[5:06:34] <%krispen_wa> hinata's boobs redeem the manga
[5:06:38] <venomfury86> Everything except the war arc was okay to me
[5:06:40] <%Exiliator> I dont think its bad, I think its dumb
[5:06:42] <+Bluydee> this entire asspull shit is 15 chapters compared to the 600 chapters prior
[5:06:50] <CozyGUNNA> @krispen_wa on god
[5:06:51] <%masterpiecejeremy> Part 1 Good. Shippuden BAD
[5:06:51] <%ggbhtg> Woolie is BACK OUT
[5:06:52] <andrei11dr> I feel about it like the Eyepatch Wolf's video says "A series of highs and lows"
[5:06:54] <C4m3r0n0409> THIS PART LAST YEARS
[5:06:55] <CozyGUNNA> hinata NTR
[5:06:59] <C4m3r0n0409> WHAT 15 CHAPTERS LIAR
[5:06:59] <%ggbhtg> BACK OUT no Jutsu
[5:07:01] <phatmac16> WOOLIE IS BACK OUT
[5:07:08] <VidulaSaix> Pretty much
[5:07:11] <tookool5678> are we LP Boruto?
[5:07:11] <Arnoldoaad1> Woolie have you heard of a Manwha named Solo Leveling, no anime yet.
[5:07:13] <%jiggy_snipe> but its a lesson in having a story planned out
[5:07:14] <@Solidus_113> So you're not going to do the Boruto expansion
[5:07:14] <C4m3r0n0409> YEP
[5:07:17] <%krispen_wa> The last 100 chapters or so were terrible, so that's 1/7 of the manga at least that sucks
[5:07:17] <Shishi1205> This bullshit lasted for years
[5:07:17] <%Fujiwara_92> BACKING OUT
[5:07:20] <%heroversusofficial> Cheer500 People who claim Izanagi are only for death saves have no idea how it works. To quote the wiki: "With a normal genjutsu, a user will apply an illusion to a target's senses, causing the target to experience things that are not real. With Izanagi, the user applies an illusion to reality itself, giving the user control over what is and is not real for as long as Izanagi is active." Izanami wasn't invented as a hard counter, they were invented alongside one another. (ala Kamui close/far)
[5:07:23] <C4m3r0n0409> SO MUCH TASH
[5:07:24] <zamzoph> ENDLESS TRASH
[5:07:25] <austinj24> Naruto is Consistent Kappa
[5:07:26] <Shishi1205> I saw this shit to the end
[5:07:26] <%heroversusofficial> P:
[5:07:27] <RiceeFTW> literal years of some doodoo
[5:07:28] <%optimasmaximas> @zenith0111 welp, then im going to continue hoping that one of the things i theorized/hope(?) (idk what word to use cause i dont want to say theorized but fuck it) they could be doing is that nomura and square realized that the vast majority of people who beat the og ff7 never understood the ending and that pat saying the ending was meteor crashing and groundhog daying the universe, so they will make it more apparent to be that groundhog day aspect
[5:07:34] <+NarcissistCactus> hey alright
[5:07:36] <%ggbhtg> @Solidus_113 omega lul
[5:07:42] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Naruto fans are just Stockholm Syndrome folks
[5:07:43] <mrblack499> plz skip boruto
[5:07:44] <drawertogether> 700 episodes
[5:07:46] <+LUN4RKiD> the filler is like 40% of all 720 episodes
[5:07:48] <%ChoculaUltra> I still cannot imagine being an anime-only Naruto fan. The amount of filler in the OG series and Shippuden is fucking i n s a n e.
[5:07:48] <%TheFabledAble> I remember watching watching naruto as a kid and for 85% of it it felt like I was just going through the motions cause I hadnt solidified what I liked/looked for in anime yet. Now that I know what the bar for quality is honestly it grates be how long I suffered through being bored watching naruto
[5:07:49] <+oda_flobunaga> If the ending is trash, does it invalidate the rest of it, eg Game of Thrones?
[5:07:51] <C4m3r0n0409> NARUTO FANS ARE THE WORST
[5:08:02] <Daba_mk2> you can still like things even if they are bad
[5:08:08] <CozyGUNNA> naruto fans still exist cmonBruh
[5:08:08] <VidulaSaix> No @oda_flobunaga but it does kill any desire to go back and revisit it
[5:08:08] <C4m3r0n0409> Cut out the garbage and it's a good show
[5:08:10] <%ggbhtg> the spirit of Chakra
[5:08:13] <tookool5678> yes

[5:08:35] <Camail> just give me night guy
[5:08:37] <+KilogramHours> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli hell yeah
[5:08:37] <%ggbhtg> Chakra was meant to connect us all !
[5:08:39] <%optimasmaximas> @oda_flobunaga i was gonna say another example would be last of us 2 aparently, but idk if you saw those spoilers, so i want to ask if you did first
[5:08:41] <GoldeNOVA> @woolieversus I really hope you see the team specials
[5:08:42] <nasubi_benjamin> @WoolieVersus How can you that opinion on Naruto and not the same on Jojo's when it has way more asspulls and trash writing ?
[5:08:42] <C4m3r0n0409> Flawed as fuck
[5:08:42] <0rond> don't let the fact that it's dumb distract you from the fact it's cool

[5:08:54] <Shishi1205> Nowhere near this shit
[5:08:55] <+LUN4RKiD> Its just the experience and nostalgia that makes it all great, seeing the good and the bad all in one
[5:09:00] <%FuqBoiSlim> Most of the diehard Naruto fans are in the comments to YouTube videos and Twitter
[5:09:01] <drawertogether> Diamond is Breakable

[5:09:13] <C4m3r0n0409> Utter Trash
[5:09:14] <+AJ_Cherenkov> But maybe you don't have to see it. Cut your losses now and it might be healthier for you in the long term
[5:09:22] <%ggbhtg> One Piece is good, and long. Expanded dong
[5:09:23] <%Ashenik1> and the diamond stinks
[5:09:24] <Shishi1205> Dressrosa was a looooong drag

[5:12:56] <%ggbhtg> Samurai 8 was too front loaded with lore
[5:13:04] <+NWannabe> and bad art
[5:13:06] <phatmac16> Samurai 8 is worse than naruto
[5:13:07] <venomfury86> Obito had also glasses

[5:13:27] <sunwraith91> waht's kubo's new thing?
[5:13:27] <RiceeFTW> imagine talking about manga when there's fire manhwa like Tower of God
[5:13:30] <black_pariah> samurai 8 i liked but it couldnt get itself together fast enough
[5:13:31] <+treborant> ITS FIIIINEEEE
[5:13:31] <phatmac16> who cares
[5:13:32] <%perfectsalami> It had themes that were way too interesting for the story to be that boring
[5:13:33] <%Robot_Nixon_> Is there an anyone stronger than Madara Uchiha? And I'm referring to Rinne Tensei Madara Uchiha with the Eternal Mangekyou Sharingan and Rinnegan doujutsus (with the rikidou paths ability) equipped with his Gunbai and control of the juubi and Gedou Mazou, a complete Susano'o, with Hashirama Senju's DNA implanted in his chest so he can perform Mokuton kekkei genkai and yin-yang release ninjutsu as well as being extremely skilled in taijutsu and bukijutsu.

[5:16:12] <VidulaSaix> @WoolieVersus The tl;dr if you dont care about Boruto spoilers is that Kaguya is from out space and is running from her clan, and her plan was to create an army of White Zetsu to defend herself from her bretheren when they arrived on earth to take back power from her. It's stupid
