[3:23:54] <%Totally_Not_Toby> walleye rocks the shit out of every other fish
[3:23:56] <%kittens_for_yays> so, i talk shit, but ive never ate crab, or lobster
[3:24:01] <+rdark_ksu> Most white fish is on the blander side
[3:24:07] <+pickledundead> when it comes to sushi, I love me some eel
[3:24:09] <Major_monotone> I cannot disagree with this conversation more, seafood in all forms is top tier
[3:24:17] <SirGO0SE> grilled octopus is the fucking BOMB
[3:24:17] <+Jhylla81> seafood usually needs some kind of sauce or butter to taste great. But a great steak doesn't need anything
[3:24:18] <%Totally_Not_Toby> other than catfish. walleye and catfish own the fuck out of everything else
[3:24:28] <worldbrand> seafood is anathema to me
[3:24:30] <%gigacanuck> beatsaber?
