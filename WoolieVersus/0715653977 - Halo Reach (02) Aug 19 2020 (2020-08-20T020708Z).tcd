[0:07:23] <+QueequegTheater> "How big is this battle?" "Yes."
[0:07:24] <%BallerSwagBro9k> HOW RIDICULOUS?: YES
[0:07:25] <%RioGascar> its an issue of writing scale vs BEING ABLE TO ACTUALLY DEPIC IT
[0:07:32] <%doomerskeletor13> All the good writing in Halo 3 happened in terminals Kappa
[0:07:36] <%RioGascar> like this cant be depicated
[0:07:40] <%DappercatEsquire> ring worlds and dyson spheres, they had it going on
[0:07:46] <%RioGascar> in games, movies, nothing
[0:07:52] <%RioGascar> it has to be books/writing
[0:07:53] <%The_Swedish_X> Apparently a terminal in Halo 1 states they didn't make as many rings as they were hoping to make.
[0:08:15] <%brachydios777> @the_swedish_x Flood fucked up their plans
[0:08:16] <+OmegaWeltall> Kardishev?
[0:08:16] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:08:17] <rowboat_girlyman> Kardashev scale
[0:08:19] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> the easy route is to go "it was so sophisticated you can't even imagine" and then not describe it like early lifecraft
[0:08:26] <sniffy77> does woolie know about the muthafucking star roads that were complete hax during the war
[0:08:27] <andre11dr> Also you must assume that all of the ships are 3d printed, there's not enough of materials available for that level of war
[0:08:28] <%LiquidDinosaur> TTGL
[0:08:30] <%doomerskeletor13> Kardashev yeah
[0:08:39] <+JustToWatch> Halo does a reverse Kardashev scale
[0:08:42] <%dekkitout> That civilization class thing reminds me of some recent stuff from Hickman's X-men
[0:08:45] <$jake5713> Kurzgezat?
[0:08:48] <Ynkubus_> Xeelee Sequence novels do a great job of tackling that
[0:08:49] <%huskarl_zap> your just tier 1 bro
[0:08:49] <%domokun124> big limit
[0:08:58] <%ringabal> How do you surpass the concept of movemnent
[0:08:59] <%ScreamLord> I think Omega is "Use the Multiverse"
[0:09:02] <eldragon_1> Anti Spiral level
[0:09:03] <%jorniev> STAR FOR GE
[0:09:06] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @justtowatch a vehsadrak scale Kappa
[0:09:07] <%doomerskeletor13> @dekkitout That‚Äôs because that series specifically mentions the Kardashev scale lol
[0:09:12] <jaygee303> Every Mjolnir costs a smalll starship
[0:09:14] <%krispen_wa> BECOME AS GOD
[0:09:17] <DigitalJoshie> Halo has some of my favorite space concepts
[0:09:17] <+OmegaWeltall> we'er not even on the Kardishev scale
[0:09:19] <Depthcharge2030> it was a good fight tho
[0:09:20] <+ZoltanBMagnus> Attack and dethrone THE UNIVERSE
[0:09:24] <%dekkitout> That, and the world mind/phalanx thing
[0:09:27] <DemonicHoward> @The_Swedish_X going to dance around it a bit, but they made the first batch of halo rings, then found a way to make them smaller and stronger to most of the old rings were scrapped and used as material for the smaller rings, only one big ring currently exist
[0:09:30] <+JustToWatch> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug very good
[0:09:33] <akosinoogie> aw shit, i haven't started playing automata

[0:10:02] <REGNIERx> Dragonfall is amazing, there has never been more interesting ending choices. I chose to side with the bad guys
[0:10:04] <%krispen_wa> SO MANY GODS
[0:10:05] <%Andrizzleton> Pillars 1 is good...2 ehhh
[0:10:08] <raikagelord1> You could also use the multiverse and then Reality.
[0:10:10] <+JeromeMci> Nice one Little V, it was great. Too bad about pPillar though.
[0:10:13] <ShiningAxis> Never make a deal with a dragon

[0:10:33] <%krispen_wa> Disco Elysium is FUCKING AMAZING
[0:10:36] <%LiquidDinosaur> i played Shadowrun 1
[0:10:37] <+Thesson> HONG KONG IS EVEN BETTER

[0:10:52] <%brian_peppers1> But what if I don't like reading tho???
[0:10:55] <%wunp_fxs> The systems in Hong kong are better
[0:10:55] <%Andrizzleton> Yes @krispen_wa V should check out Disco Elysium
[0:11:03] <akosinoogie> I like that adding cyberware to your character affects your magic/mana affinity
[0:11:04] <Loxoron> So since I know I missed the last stream, has Woolie watched Halo Legends yet?
[0:11:11] <DemonicHoward> nope
[0:11:16] <%huskarl_zap> But wage cage corpo cucks is pretty strong way to start your book

[0:16:55] <%Halospaz117> You gotta have the desire you search it yourself
[0:16:57] <%DensityD> hey look how hard I can piss, piss out this lore
[0:16:58] <+JustToWatch> At this point we might need to do a let's watch of the master chief of loneliness video

[0:17:05] <EDFscout> "I'm spending efforty to unlearn it"
[0:17:15] <+jiggy_snipe> it's like throwing alot of Elder Scrolls lore when someone starts Skyrim for the 1st time
[0:17:15] <andre11dr> Not even Dark Souls has this much lore, woolieONEGUY needs to stop
[0:17:24] <%RioGascar> people had to wait YEARS for answers to these questions
[0:17:24] <%brachydios777> In other words, STOP MESSAGING HIM ABOUT THE LORE!
[0:17:26] <%DensityD> I will take, one half of a context, as a snack
[0:17:27] <Jontman42> and you gotta build that context yourself instead of having it explained
[0:17:30] <%krispen_wa> Halo should have just been a military shootbang

[0:17:34] <%emperordread> But like it NOW tho
[0:17:37] <%phatmac16> STOP MESSAGING ABOUT THE LORE

[0:17:47] <%phatmac16> JUST LET HIM SHOOT THE GUN

[0:17:54] <Grandfather_Nurgle333> @phatmac16 no
[0:17:56] <%BisoromiBear> take a shot every time V adjusts the mic
[0:17:57] <R3Roundabout> Do we really need 30 minutes of bitching about spoilers at the start of every dtream?
[0:18:01] <%huskarl_zap> git caught crossing the border
[0:18:08] <%brian_peppers1> NO PLEASE EXPLAIN ALL OF IT
[0:18:12] <%RioGascar> now how do you do that with halo? bungie even failed at it
[0:18:20] <%CappuccinoGuil> @R3Roundabout yes. I personally requested it to God AND Anime
[0:18:21] <Djinnazz> Thanks for the HyperParkour @phatmac16
[0:18:23] <%krispen_wa> they wouldn't need 30 min if everyone didn't keep soiling him
[0:18:24] <+QueequegTheater> @R3Roundabout Yes, because people keep doing it.
[0:18:27] <%jorniev> we will actively unlearn and stop liking this thing if you keep shoving in my face
[0:18:29] <QuietSandshrew> revealing the fog of war
[0:18:30] <%RioGascar> oh you have a question on this? wait years
[0:18:30] <Lewisisphat> @R3Roundabout until people stop, ye i guess
[0:18:31] <%huskarl_zap> Make me okay with dragon running earth
[0:18:32] <+tacoducktwitch> so you start with the 36 lessons
[0:18:33] <+Extrallent> @R3Roundabout if people shut the fuck up he wouldn't

[0:18:37] <+jiggy_snipe> @krispen_wa Kappa soiling
[0:18:37] <%DensityD> you can pass ShadowRun on to someone else, but you can pass on Halo, you get absorbed in Halo
[0:18:38] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> TBF people dont fucking lksten @r3

[0:18:39] <shinichizio> tl;dr "I do not care yet"

[0:18:56] <EDFscout> Each time V adjusts the mic, A woolieONEGUY gets pulverized
[0:18:57] <+LittleCinders> Instead of giving Woolie lore with mega spoilers, why not tell him just neat spoiler free tidbits? like about the ship names and weapons
[0:19:00] <%Andrizzleton> so let me tell you about CHIM
[0:19:03] <%krispen_wa> SO LET ME SPOIL YOU ABOUT FATE LORE

[0:26:54] <%BurdRightsActivist> lolifate
[0:26:54] <%doomerskeletor13> Fighting games? Woolie plays those? Kappa
[0:26:55] <%domokun124> every gam le should have woolie settings
[0:26:57] <TungstenViper> that's not how fps work
[0:27:00] <%derap41> It not straight better its different
[0:27:03] <+QueequegTheater> That shouldn't apply when it's literally a hardware limitation
[0:27:05] <%krispen_wa> hmmmmmm
[0:27:08] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> but controller sensitivity tho
[0:27:10] <%DensityD> internal growth, not external assistance. woolie will MAKE HIMSELF get better
[0:27:10] <+jiggy_snipe> eh it depends
[0:27:10] <%Javaa01> No fuck that, make the game work FOR you
[0:27:12] <+Ragnvaldr_AGH> FPS is a liiittle different there
[0:27:14] <sniffy77> thanks bruh
[0:27:14] <%Williamld> Except low sensitivity is more like taping over your low buttons
[0:27:17] <%derap41> Try Sniping on high sensitivity
[0:27:19] <+khalcipher> You did great last sesion tho!
[0:27:20] <%vaderxyz1970> mind goblins
[0:27:20] <%MajoraZ> Go with a medium sensitivity, but maxed out acceleration: So you have control for fine adjuistments, but full stick movements are fast @WoolieVersus
[0:27:22] <DigitalJoshie> yeah I see where you coming from woolie
[0:27:23] <heartlesshealer> Woolie keeps himself unsullied by Summon Suffering macros
[0:27:27] <jaygee303> Sensitivity is a weird one, it‚Äôs like a reaction limiter before it gets ridiculous
[0:27:27] <%brachydios777> I recommend just changing it until it feels right
[0:27:31] <Toaster_Noodle> That is a bad way to go about it
[0:27:32] <black_pariah> this is a different genre woolie
[0:27:37] <%DensityD> yeah, it's button configs
[0:27:38] <armchairmaster_> Sensitivity is akin to adjusting the dead zones on a fighting stick
[0:27:45] <QuietSandshrew> buttons change a bit
[0:27:48] <+slimmixrp> Fighting games dont have movement settings so makes sense
[0:27:51] <%DensityD> little of column A and little of column B
[0:27:55] <+tacoducktwitch> woolie, please reload more often
[0:27:56] <%ScreamLord> A bit of both, yeah
[0:27:59] <%jorniev> wouldn't it be like when you change the trigger with Nero ?
[0:28:01] <%ChoculaUltra> to be fair, I feel aim sensitivity and muscle memory go hand in hand. There isn't a "perfect" setting for everyone as no one can quantify how much/how little force you personally put into the a flick.
[0:28:02] <%ringabal> Woolie has played 3.5 Halo games with these Rock Lee weights
[0:28:06] <no_johns_justin> its like changing game speed in super turbo and practicing till you can play at higher speeds
[0:28:07] <+GrassCannon> Git gud at not having to git gud Kappa
[0:28:07] <+D00msDayDan> how did this turn into a woolie rant just fiddle with the sens until it feel good
[0:28:09] <EDFscout> aquire those skillz
[0:28:14] <%jorniev> TEKKEN FINGERS
[0:28:18] <Loxoron> @woolieversus turning up the sensitivity is putting on weighted training gear
[0:28:22] <%BigBlackBankai> Reach?
[0:28:27] <heartlesshealer> You're trying to bypass tekken fingers
[0:28:29] <%derap41> Sniping on high settings is a bitch tho
[0:28:31] <+jiggy_snipe> sometimes your settings or controller can actually limit you no matter what
[0:28:33] <%ChoculaUltra> then again I play fps with k&m so I have no fucking clue what it's like for controllers nowadays.
[0:28:39] <%doomerskeletor13> Woolie putting limiters on himself
[0:28:54] <idiotscampaign> the best way to bump up sensitivity is to go one higher than comfortable and slowly work your way up to a good medium of fast and accurate. you just have to accept your initial difficulty with your new controls
[0:28:54] <Reece_G21> I forced myself to get used to maximum sensitivity and now I‚Äôm a mad man when I pls FPS games.
[0:29:00] <+NYCrownlessKing> it's like if your d-pad isn't helping you pull off the fireball input, so you decide to use a different controller or the c-stick to perform it better @WoolieVersus
[0:29:02] <QuietSandshrew> Woolies stand has gotten ahold of his mind
[0:29:06] <%DensityD> this is part of the woolie attitude and woolie mindset that makes me like watching him
[0:29:09] <%DensityD> good stuff.
[0:29:11] <andre11dr> I love how we have to translate FPS ,the mainstream thing, to nish fighting game lingo, i fucking love this stream LUL
[0:29:14] <+NYCrownlessKing> it's changing the feel of the movement to something more preferable @WoolieVersus
[0:29:16] <+owlentertainment> wait have they played yet

[0:29:34] <turf_wind_and_fire> Without getting into their personal lives: I thought V lives in Calgary? Is he from Montreal?
[0:29:38] <%derap41> If heads shots are trouble its because your sensitivity to high
[0:29:38] <+TheotherKristian> I'm playing Doom Eternal on Nightmare with a controller, Higher Sensitivity has not been the greatest piece of help, for me.
[0:29:39] <jetstreamlover_ryocan> Jackals and Skirmisher can reach the rank of Warmaister/Warmistress
[0:29:39] <nintega010> me yep. Reason I love Red Steel gyro controls
[0:29:40] <+NYCrownlessKing> it's like if your d-pad isn't helping you pull off the fireball input, so you decide to use a different controller or the c-stick to perform it better @WoolieVersus maybe even changing which type of "gate" your using for the arcade stick
[0:29:44] <Jashter18> Woolie just has some booty accuracy he'll get better with time
[0:29:46] <Loxoron> What sensitivity do you play Titanfall 2 on?
[0:29:47] <%ChoculaUltra> Woolie puts a lot of value in the intrinsic rewards from gaming and I appreciate that a lot.
[0:29:49] <EDFscout> This some good conversation
[0:30:00] <%Theycallmenerf> 1/72
[0:30:00] <%Halospaz117> The weird thing is I'm pretty sure that thought process is actually better for real life shooting
[0:30:01] <Valorzard> hi i just joined the stream and I'm so lost
[0:30:04] <+Tacotouchdown> Yo
[0:30:13] <%DensityD> here's the funny thing I like. Woolie: "I'm having trouble getting headshots." some tryhard: "No but just do it tho"
[0:30:17] <jetstreamlover_ryocan> Grunt can become Priest. enlighten by the light of God!
[0:30:18] <%derap41> Aim above and let the autoaim hit it
[0:30:19] <+owlentertainment> are they already finished?
[0:30:22] <%ChoculaUltra> @Valorzard talking about aiming and controller sensitivity rn
[0:30:25] <%Javaa01> Headshots aren't a linear increase in value per bullet, it's exponential
[0:30:25] <heartlesshealer> No shot drop
[0:30:35] <Loxoron> Still starting @owlentertainment
[0:30:40] <%DensityD> that god tier pistol

[0:30:43] <QuietSandshrew> dmr is nuts like that
[0:30:46] <$kirin_fellwinter> Hey Woolie, long time fan. fun gameplay mechanic: the assassinations are context sensitive to your position behind your target. For example: if you assassinate an airborne enemy you'll power slam them back to the ground. Assassinating while falling uses gravity's mometum for the kill. Cheer500
[0:30:48] <$kirin_fellwinter> kirin_fellwinter's Cheer shared rewards to 10 others in Chat!
[0:30:48] <EDFscout> "Effective range"
[0:30:49] <Camail> i mean, if you can make a technical aspect of a game easier, and your goal is to perform as best as you can, then change it. playing to win doesnt just mean getting good.

[0:31:42] <%DensityD> woolie figures out FPS games
[0:31:45] <%brachydios777> What‚Äôs nuts with Destiny is that different guns have different amounts of auto aim
[0:31:50] <%ChoculaUltra> it's crazy that the only 2 guests on Superbeast have been a cat and a dog LUL.

[0:33:22] <DatAsuna> idk here, if you can't drive stick you don't have a license
[0:33:26] <%DensityD> something something magnesium shifters run off of steering wheel paddles
[0:33:28] <+NYCrownlessKing> it's like if your analog-stick isn't helping you pull off the fireball input, so you decide to use a different controller or the D-pad to perform movement inputs better @WoolieVersus maybe even changing which type of "gate" your using for the arcade stick
[0:33:29] <+QueequegTheater> Manual is the car version of learning Japanese to watch subbed anime

[0:36:08] <turf_wind_and_fire> That's a really good comparison honestly
[0:36:09] <heartlesshealer> It can be good, but it has to be done super right for the right songs
[0:36:09] <%DensityD> du hast
[0:36:10] <+mattiabh> yeah you have to nail the translation
[0:36:12] <andre11dr> Iea totally

Season 2 is in 1979 and the main character is the old dad cop from the first season. He actually mentions parts of it in Season 1. Enjoy your session guys

[0:51:24] <$Truunbeaten> Man, I get that backseat gaming isn‚Äôt exactly looked highly upon but V is like really fucking aggressive about it. It makes him come off as a bit of an ass, I hope it‚Äôs just cause it‚Äôs happened so much and not his regular attitude.

[0:54:45] <slamview> Auto tune is just another tool to use, it can sound good or bad depending on context and preference
[0:54:45] <Jontman42> Vocaloid stuff can be cool, but even then I've always liked real people doing covers of the vocaloid songs lol

[0:54:48] <MoonsideLore> Kikuo makes it work. That's honestly about it though, and it's largely because it's intentionally going for unsettling and inhuman.
[0:54:49] <ColbyBryant> Jesus is king best album confirmed
[0:54:50] <%Karkatstoaster> Woolie is a fleshboomet
[0:54:50] <%afronooch> 808s is Kanye's best
[0:54:52] <%dangarworld> Didn't realise Woolie was a big fan of Jesus is King
[0:54:53] <%ChoculaUltra> remember when Disney made a movie to that Tron soundtrack Daft Punk made? Such a bold move.
[0:54:55] <DatAsuna> woolie roboracist confirmed
[0:54:57] <+FlubbedPig> I think auto-tune is good for flavor purposes. Like, since it adds a weird techy quality to the voice, it works for sci-fi settings.
[0:55:00] <hereiam345> 808 has a few bangers

[1:35:14] <$kirin_fellwinter> dont let woolie write there families plz! "Ma'am, your sons death was not in vein. His sacrifice granted me the jetpack I always wanted!"
[1:35:17] <tetraes> i thought armor lock was the best?
[1:35:22] <%huskarl_zap> sprint is best ability but it should be built in and not only 3 seconds long
[1:35:27] <Kiyosuki> Beam Rifle PogChamp
[1:35:28] <%RioGascar> v bringing the sprint up but talking nothing about it is...like why bring it up?
[1:35:28] <+Zyquux> it's basically Pharah jetpack
[1:35:30] <DeepSearch27> Jorge
[1:35:33] <RahuHordika> That's a truck woolie
[1:35:34] <%Zceryll> in solo heroic and legendary the drop shield is actually the best ability
[1:35:35] <Kotyc_> it's a Jorge Hog
[1:35:36] <DeepSearch27> Jorge is the set up
[1:35:36] <$serpenttucker> I mean it's alright. Certainly has it's applications
[1:35:38] <$usotaku013666> The beam rifle is okay in multiplayer
[1:35:41] <+Tacotouchdown> V is weighed down by sprints gravity
[1:35:42] <%subjectg> Jetpack‚Äôs good on certain maps but makes you an open target on others
[1:35:43] <%RioGascar> there was controversy? why?
[1:35:43] <%brave_sj> Woolie can't hear anyone saying words that aren't "jetpack"
[1:35:44] <DemonicHoward> Jorge is the gun
[1:35:44] <+CSNG> Focus rifle is fun if everyone stands still, which they never do
[1:35:44] <%Halospaz117> The Focus Rifle is just an angry flashlight shined in the eyes

[1:38:15] <dinnydanny777> Jorge crashed the helicopter because he's immune to damage
[1:38:18] <+jetjagger222> and name him george
[1:38:20] <Solidnick18> he made a mistake
[1:38:23] <dinnydanny777> He thought everyone else was too
[1:38:25] <%huskarl_zap> is George australian or russian?
[1:38:27] <%krispen_wa> he loves spartanface and you'll love it too
[1:38:31] <Hammatime8> Jorge just ate that plasma

[1:39:14] <%The_Swedish_X> you can also steal a banshee
[1:39:20] <bricklordly> Pretty sure he's Hungarian since he was born on Reach and Reach is a colony of mostly Hungarian people
[1:39:20] <pochecito> KICK

[1:47:22] <%LiquidDinosaur> if the chief is a Space Marine then Noble Team is like the space marines from the Astartes short movies. All tacticool and using teamwork and shit
[1:47:26] <%huskarl_zap> watch the stage play to learn about smiles no face

[1:48:04] <%huskarl_zap> ok but Chaplains are AWESOME
[1:48:05] <+Tacotouchdown> But the 2s got augment as children the 3s were teen orphan s

[1:48:34] <+valiard> Spartans are closer to custodes than astartes?
[1:48:38] <%doomerskeletor13> Someday Woolie will understand armor lock
[1:48:43] <%LiquidDinosaur> This is what hanging with Elites should have been like in Halo 3
[1:48:44] <%RunningNGunning> This is the best mission in the game, except on Legendary
[1:48:45] <%huskarl_zap> @valiard noooo
[1:48:45] <DeepSearch27> Woolie got better tho
[1:48:46] <%RioGascar> halo learned that 30 seconds can carry tou FAR
[1:48:47] <pochecito> Yeeted
[1:48:49] <$serpenttucker> @subjectg I personally also had a vendetta against BR/DMR starts , so that title update didn't color my opinions favorably
[1:48:49] <+Zyquux> Doesn't armor lock actually delay shield regen?
[1:48:52] <%LiquidDinosaur> but you're only actually fighting with Elites in Halo 3 for like 5 fucking minutes
[1:48:56] <%CappuccinoGuil> @derap41 now he just needs to learn the bursting tech with automatic weapons
[1:48:57] <+CyanDeadEye> Yes
[1:48:58] <+D00msDayDan> armor lock's duration is the same as the regen delay
[1:49:01] <wubi_desu> I think woolie thinks armor lock acts as a boost to his shields or something
[1:49:09] <%yhom_tork> F
[1:49:09] <+Haildrops> It does in multiplayer but it seems to let it recharge in single
[1:49:09] <%huskarl_zap> in what world
[1:49:09] <%krispen_wa> The Covenant were SO fucking lucky they only had to fight John Halo in the original trilogy
[1:49:11] <%derap41> Its fine
[1:49:12] <%LiquidDinosaur> Imo its so cute how in Halo 3 the elites painted their banshees green, to like, show they're on Team Human
[1:49:16] <+GruntOfAction> It's to the left I think
[1:49:16] <Solidnick18> oh
[1:49:17] <%slppanther29> Elite was like: ‚ÄúFuck‚Äù
[1:49:17] <+slimmixrp> In this room right?
[1:49:20] <RamenRiderZ> Armor Lock was such a fun equipment on Multiplayer :)
[1:49:25] <Louie_Salmon> No
[1:49:25] <%DarkestVegemite> Its in this room!
[1:49:26] <+Secutus> It's in this room
[1:49:29] <%doomerskeletor13> Shiiiit cap‚Äôn
[1:49:30] <SpaceGuntank> it makes you invincible for a short period
[1:49:33] <%derap41> That's it
[1:49:34] <$serpenttucker> IIRC Armor lock does not charge shields
[1:49:34] <Nomad94> It's a duration of being invincible. That's it.
[1:49:35] <+Haildrops> WOOHOO
[1:49:36] <%subjectg> @serpenttucker yeah not a big fan of slayer dmrs. In moderation maybe, but definitely not all the fucking time. Also elite slayer needs more play
[1:49:36] <APegForReggie> it has an emp
[1:49:38] <+Haildrops> HE GOT IT
[1:49:38] <bearwagon> its a gun woolie
[1:49:39] <+Secutus> left of the hologram
[1:49:41] <%yhom_tork> it fucks up vehicles
[1:49:43] <Kotyc_> shields charge like normal
[1:49:45] <DeepSearch27> Thank god he asked
[1:49:47] <%CappuccinoGuil> BECOME WALL
[1:49:49] <%MaddyCaddy> It reflects plasma grenades too
[1:49:52] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @serpenttucker the opposite, actually: Shields stop charging while you have armor lock up
[1:50:00] <$serpenttucker> @subjectg preaching to the choir
[1:50:03] <%krispen_wa> ROYAL GUARD
[1:50:04] <%RioGascar> @LiquidDinosaur i beleive it also had to do with back in 2 where players got confused as arby when phantoms attacked you after the civil war
[1:50:05] <%Slimshazbot> Saves you from being stuck, too
[1:50:09] <Reizie_Etherealm> Installing a buff by charging with a ground pound does sound pretty rad ngl
[1:50:09] <%DensityD> no one on earth can make it fall
[1:50:11] <%DensityD> THE WALL
[1:50:13] <dinnydanny777> It's a great vehicle shield tbh
[1:50:15] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> LORE woolieYE woolieYE
[1:50:25] <Louie_Salmon> You see, it's like an EX move in neutral focus attack ukemi
[1:50:25] <+CSNG> l33t stasi5
[1:50:29] <dinnydanny777> It does damage to the vehicle too I think
[1:50:32] <Nomad94> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug not in campaign, hey don't
[1:50:44] <%doomerskeletor13> Hmmm
[1:50:49] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @Nomad94 oh, nvm. It's been a while since I played this game :)
[1:50:49] <Joestar1890> hmm,
[1:50:52] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> I n her knew these existed in reach
[1:50:52] <%Karkatstoaster> Wall of runes 1 blue mama 0/4
[1:50:52] <+D00msDayDan> get ready for people talking about johnson being a spartan 1 in donos
[1:50:53] <Reizie_Etherealm> Are the voices reversed?
[1:50:54] <%LiquidDinosaur> @RioGascar now, this would be a Yoko Taro level move that would and should be vetoed, but i'd design the campaign to be as unfriendly and punishing as possible for players too stupid to realize whn they're Arbiter and who their enemies should and should not be
[1:50:55] <+CyanDeadEye> Armor Lock will destroy boosting ghosts at full speed
[1:51:02] <+Haildrops> I don't think camo will ever be relevant in campaign again but i hope he explains that one too
[1:51:06] <%huskarl_zap> good shut woolie
[1:51:06] <sniffy77> orion is spartan 1 basically
[1:51:07] <%condemned_15> Lore makes me violent
[1:51:12] <TimetodiveLTX> same
[1:51:17] <xxshadowxx416> John was in it
[1:51:19] <+JingKaisean> John Reach is back!

[1:51:20] <TigerClaws12> AngelThump

[1:51:25] <%yhom_tork> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[1:51:26] <$serpenttucker> IMO the armor abilities should have also had applications in the air, like armor lock being a ground pound if activated in the air, sprint having a big forward jump, hologram actively jumping, etc
[1:51:26] <%RunningNGunning> AngelThump
[1:51:27] <bricklordly> oh boy woolie isn't ready PogChamp

[1:51:48] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus It turns out Noble 6's middle name was Redips
[1:51:48] <ChernoMuncho> woolie you wasted ammo in the last mission

[1:52:56] <dinnydanny777> Shit I thought this part was in a different game
[1:52:57] <sniffy77> i wonder why this program was classified? its just a starfighter program
[1:52:59] <%krispen_wa> Foreigner Saber looks different
[1:53:01] <%condemned_15> Reach needs more Baphmodads
[1:53:03] <+Haildrops> Bungie's philosophy with their games was leave all the intricate non-linked lore to the books and datapads and only focus on the core story for the games.

[1:53:10] <%LiquidDinosaur> @RioGascar i mean, "you're an alien, but just because you're an alien doesnt mean all aliens are your friends if some of them are heretics, or a race war is happening"

[1:53:26] <+D00msDayDan> i love all these fixed cameras
[1:53:27] <+Darksolstace> @sniffy77 probably a secret from the Insurrectionists.
[1:53:30] <%phatmac16> YEYEYEYEYEYEYEYEYE
[1:53:31] <dinnydanny777> Star Fox Assault's story is fucked up
[1:53:33] <%huskarl_zap> roger this is sauce boss 5 by 5 over?
[1:53:35] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @sniffy77 the Humans were still in the middle of a war against insurrectionists on other colonies, so it was probably "we don't want the rebels to know we have cool space ships on reach"
[1:53:37] <$serpenttucker> OH woolie likes EVA
[1:53:38] <%derap41> Discarded Rockets its so outdated
[1:53:43] <infernalram> @sniffy77 it has vehicle wide shields so insurrectionists did not need to know about that
[1:53:47] <coreyyotto> @Haildrops Which honestly was probably a good move. The biggest problem with the 343 games is the over-bearing lore dumps
[1:53:49] <Reizie_Etherealm> 5 centuries into the future and we still can't avoid dumping space debris
[1:53:49] <+CyanDeadEye> Pretty much
[1:53:49] <%derap41> They can do most things ok
[1:53:50] <%unclekulikov> yeah, but the squad also pilots just fine
[1:53:50] <sniffy77> oh right the innes
[1:53:51] <%vaderxyz1970> I love how you see the other ones launch with you
[1:53:56] <%RioGascar> they are trained to be able to adapt

[1:54:02] <bricklordly> this only reminds me that space combat isn't in Destiny and now I'm frustrated
[1:54:02] <%RioGascar> but they cant do everyting

[1:54:41] <TimetodiveLTX> why are there so many fate fans here
[1:54:43] <nintega010> @huskarl_zap I'm still mad they didn't make a star fox assault 2. They could've improved the ground gameplay even more
[1:54:44] <dinnydanny777> I completely forgot about this part of the game
[1:54:48] <Joestar1890> @brave_sj OPERATION: SHORYUKEN

[1:55:10] <Nomad94> Do an Aileron Roll

[1:55:17] <+QueequegTheater> @DSD24 This isn't Ace Combat, it's Starfox
[1:55:19] <%Karkatstoaster> Original Battlefront II, on original xbox
[1:55:20] <+Darksolstace> That Sabre goes a lot faster than it looks.
[1:55:20] <Reizie_Etherealm> Didn't ace combat 3 electrosphere go to space?
[1:55:24] <%DSD24> We got the good music going

[1:55:41] <Explodincatz> its hard in solo
[1:55:41] <%Karkatstoaster> You could fly into the enemy ship and plant time bombs on the engine
[1:55:43] <%subjectg> << Noble Six, Fox Two! >>
[1:55:46] <%Karkatstoaster> So fuckin hype
[1:55:46] <Grahfvitnir> @Reizie_Etherealm yeah, well high athmosphere
[1:55:46] <%wunp_fxs> this on legendary is pretty hard
[1:55:47] <%DSD24> @QueequegTheater Good point but I have a lot more experience with Ace Combat
[1:55:48] <%jorniev> halo could have beaten battlefield if they added more of this on multiplayer
[1:55:50] <TimetodiveLTX> FeelsGoodMan
[1:55:55] <+VietcongSamurai> I hate this level on legendary.
[1:55:55] <+D00msDayDan> how long until he thinks to switch to guns
[1:55:55] <+Vigonept> ITS BULLSHIT
[1:55:55] <%derap41> Its a nice break from the FPS parts
[1:55:56] <xxshadowxx416> halo 4 did it better
[1:55:56] <%DarkestVegemite> yep

[1:56:05] <dinnydanny777> Genre Switch
[1:56:05] <%The_Swedish_X> Legendary is pretty lame in most situations,
[1:56:07] <+Wilabeen1997> This sucks on legendary
[1:56:07] <+Tacotouchdown> It sucks this section never turned into anything in multiplayer or even Destiny
[1:56:08] <%RunningNGunning> This is the worst section in the game on Legendary
[1:56:12] <%GrumbleGrouse> Secondary Fire
[1:56:14] <%RioGascar> okay solo legendary is hard
[1:56:15] <CurrySauseBandit> @MaddyCaddy Same, I just fought through it
[1:56:16] <Phort909> Which means it must lead somewhere
[1:56:18] <%RioGascar> but 4 player coop
[1:56:19] <%MaddyCaddy> I found it quite fun on Legendary
[1:56:19] <+QueequegTheater> This level is not a natural formation
[1:56:19] <%subjectg> It‚Äôs actually not too bad on legendary
[1:56:19] <%Greywolf47> I didn't do that and I went in on homing bombs
[1:56:21] <+JingKaisean> Sounds like Legendary is just scumming it
[1:56:23] <DeepSearch27> Seraphs
[1:56:23] <+Haildrops> Legendary is basically "how can i fight the least amount of people"
[1:56:25] <Sullry> crazy that they added these vehicles into forge recently
[1:56:26] <+D00msDayDan> this section is even harder in mcc on legendary because ai is twice as aggressive
[1:56:27] <+jetjagger222> those ships are shielded too
[1:56:33] <%Karkatstoaster> Platinum it up. Just throw another genre in there
[1:56:36] <bricklordly> Seraphs Kreygasm
[1:56:39] <+CSNG> "Also, do a barrel roll"
[1:56:47] <TimetodiveLTX> wait was it always lore accurate that these small ships could enter slipspace?
[1:56:49] <+Haildrops> oh shit stacker's up here?
[1:56:52] <%Greywolf47> this probably the only mission on legendary I could tolerate
[1:56:56] <OverlordLuna> Kreygasm
[1:56:57] <+YharnamNighthawk> It's a shame Destiny never got this
[1:56:57] <+D00msDayDan> @TimetodiveLTX no lol
[1:57:02] <%derap41> Where's Slappy?
[1:57:08] <+jetjagger222> i've found the target, try to keep up!
[1:57:14] <Akett> The guy who did this section made a game called House of the Dying Sun.
[1:57:14] <+Darksolstace> Oh yup I hear Stacker over comms.
[1:57:14] <+Zyquux> Did they ever explain who the other pilots are? Just the regular Sabre program pilots?
[1:57:15] <+NYCrownlessKing> when the covenant doesnt have FLARES doodLewd
[1:57:17] <bricklordly> AH! I'M HIT!
[1:57:18] <%doomerskeletor13> Where is Chips Dubbo tho
[1:57:20] <SpaceGuntank> i love the fact that they're called Seraphs, like just going deeper with the Halo theme
[1:57:36] <+Tacotouchdown> Idk y but i beat this legendary solo. It took a year tho.._
[1:57:36] <+QueequegTheater> @doomerskeletor13 Who do you think is in the back of Stacker's ship
[1:57:37] <%jorniev> DESTINY DOESN'T HAVE DOG FIGHTS!?
[1:57:38] <+Darksolstace> Chips is on the surface kicking ass as is his nature
[1:57:38] <+Haildrops> Seraphs and Liches are like the only non-ghost names in the main series

[2:00:35] <slix3431> Woolie wants us to build the mecha and he immedietly crashes it
[2:00:37] <dinnydanny777> Inverted when flying
[2:00:38] <%doomerskeletor13> Damn Star Wars Squadrons looks different
[2:00:38] <%jorniev> this should be in halo multiplayer
[2:00:38] <%Greywolf47> non inverted
[2:00:40] <StebTheVee> non invert
[2:00:43] <dinnydanny777> If flying, always invert
[2:00:44] <%derap41> Inverted with stick
[2:00:46] <OverlordLuna> non inverted
[2:00:46] <%phatmac16> Halo Dog fighting game when?
[2:00:47] <bricklordly> INVERTED FIGHT ME. RIGHT NOW.
[2:00:47] <CzeekyPlays> flying? invert
[2:00:48] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> so what does the ship do in trickster?
[2:00:49] <%Halospaz117> Invert that shit cowards
[2:00:50] <+Darksolstace> Inverted
[2:00:52] <Reizie_Etherealm> Depends if there's roll and pitch
[2:00:56] <+QueequegTheater> Flying inverted is the correct wat
[2:00:57] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:00:57] <PrideOfFiddles> Depends if you have a flight stick or not
[2:00:58] <DarkestDawn64> I like inverted for flying
[2:00:58] <+CSNG> not inverted
[2:00:59] <Onatamana> Non inverted when with mouse and keyboard, inverted with controller. I'm a very small minority.
[2:01:03] <%subjectg> non-inverted, it‚Äôs dual stick not single
[2:01:04] <karl_rex> Uninverted? You mean normal?
[2:01:07] <$serpenttucker> Due to games in the past forcing inversion, I learned to play all games inverted
[2:01:09] <thesoldierofjoy> I was so happy with this section tbh, It felt EXACTLY like SW Battlefront 2 original
[2:01:11] <+D00msDayDan> when it's aim controls like in halo i prefer uninverted
[2:01:11] <TimetodiveLTX> yeah i'm ambidextrous as far as flying controls
[2:01:20] <+CreativeBreach> If I‚Äôm using my right thumb, non-inverted, left thumb, inverted. Just what I‚Äôm used to.
[2:01:21] <%jorniev> reminds me of star hawk
[2:01:23] <+CyanDeadEye> Foreshadowing
[2:01:27] <+mans51> nice shot
[2:01:31] <+hazardousmidget> SPAAAAAAAAAAAACE
[2:01:31] <bricklordly> SourPls
[2:01:31] <dreadedcthulhu> I always think I like it the opposite way that games default to and then I change it and it feels worse
[2:01:34] <dinnydanny777> Invert because vehicle controls are inverted, you steer left to go right and right to go left
[2:01:35] <+Haildrops> What are the chances he misses the Savannah going down
[2:01:37] <zamzoph> Don't miss Jorgge
[2:01:40] <dreadedcthulhu> no matter what it starts as

[2:01:47] <%jorniev> I miss STARHAWK
[2:01:48] <Louie_Salmon> By like, a lot, right?
[2:01:50] <Reizie_Etherealm> Invert because PULL UP is to pull the stick
[2:01:52] <CurrySauseBandit> As long as it has the choice to invert. It's fine
[2:01:53] <%RioGascar> i do not believe it predates it
[2:01:54] <%derap41> This is a CoD thing
[2:01:55] <%yhom_tork> MILLIONS DEAD

[2:06:24] <%doomerskeletor13> This voice acting is great
[2:06:30] <bricklordly> no shut up
[2:06:32] <%derap41> Jamming is easy
[2:06:36] <%subjectg> I listen to AC0‚Äôs Mayhem for this section and it enhances it greatly
[2:06:38] <%DensityD> radio waves are radio waves are radio waves
[2:06:38] <%unclekulikov> Radios are at the mercy of story convenience
[2:06:38] <%Halospaz117> *Flamenco Music Intensifies*
[2:06:38] <+ItsRatman> EMP is a universal language
[2:06:39] <CurrySauseBandit> They use AI's for that though don't they?
[2:06:40] <Sp3ctre48> Humans always had AI to help them I think
[2:06:40] <TigerClaws12> it's just waves
[2:06:42] <JayPastaForce> EM are EM no matter
[2:06:45] <+Pyroclase> Because the covenant stole all their tech and are super dumb with it
[2:06:45] <$serpenttucker> I mean we are talking about a setting that has AI
[2:06:45] <Second_Omega> Can you see any borders from here
[2:06:46] <%vaderxyz1970> ENERGY
[2:06:46] <slix3431> We throw jam on thier ship
[2:06:48] <%krispen_wa> Radio is universal
[2:06:49] <+QueequegTheater> They're just playing Beastie Boys really loud over the Covenant comms
[2:06:50] <%brave_sj> Nah just flood the airwaves with static probably
[2:06:51] <+Haildrops> Is he fighting that one marine from the first mission for worst acting?
[2:06:52] <%derap41> can'
[2:06:54] <%vaderxyz1970> MEETS FOIL
[2:06:54] <gladsomepraetorian> The Covenant are imitative, not innovative.
[2:06:57] <SpaceGuntank> just hook a microwave up to a sattelite dish and then hit the defrost button lol
[2:07:00] <%jorniev> it's wall waves man
[2:07:01] <+Tacotouchdown> Halo 3 theres katana
[2:07:01] <bricklordly> GET FUCKING IN
[2:07:01] <%Slimshazbot> SUMMON THE woolieONEGUY
[2:07:02] <%doomerskeletor13> Well it‚Äôs been 25 years, we know their tech pretty well
[2:07:02] <%derap41> Can't beat the speed out light for communication
[2:07:04] <+Haildrops> "it's the covenant" said with no fear or urgency whatsoever
[2:07:05] <Reizie_Etherealm> CAUTION PULL UP, PULL UP
[2:07:05] <%phatmac16> Sabers, what is this Fate/Grand Order?
[2:07:06] <%lioan515> Electromagnetics: the great equalizer
[2:07:06] <+Darksolstace> I mean they still use radio not Quantum stuff like Mass Effect
[2:07:07] <+CSNG> Blare human music on every frequency
[2:07:07] <%Karkatstoaster> Waves
[2:07:08] <%DensityD> WE LAND ON THE ENEMY
[2:07:10] <%condemned_15> It's all made of HAM radios
[2:07:11] <Solidnick18> lol
[2:07:12] <dinnydanny777> Just block the lines
[2:07:14] <%DensityD> zero-g yeyeye
[2:07:17] <rowboat_girlyman> electronic warfare deals with the electronic spectrum, so as long as the covenant are using that to communicate, we have some grasp of how to stop it
[2:07:17] <%DensityD> zero-g
[2:07:18] <Breaburn_op> To be fair what is beyond radio that isn't just mind reading?
[2:07:19] <thesoldierofjoy> Throw out enough space bullshit, you can jam anything. Uses all of their wifi. Jacks their phone bills WAAAAY up.
[2:07:20] <%Zceryll> Jamming is just yelling loudly over someone trying to talk
[2:07:23] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> JETPACK woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE
[2:07:24] <%DSD24> @phatmac16 What is your Noble Phantasm
[2:07:27] <bricklordly> LUL
[2:07:29] <%DensityD> something something magnet shoes
[2:07:30] <Joestar1890> The Covenant kinda stole forerunner tech, they didn't make it
[2:07:32] <Solidnick18> oop
[2:07:32] <ZeroCruz> This map in multiplayer tho
[2:07:35] <+PhantomMiG> They would use binary
[2:07:35] <+QueequegTheater> Pvt. Aachoo
[2:07:37] <+OniOniOniiii> put jelly in their coms
[2:07:40] <%condemned_15> and I oop
[2:07:41] <+jetjagger222> anyone remember that part in macross/robotech where they get inside the ship
[2:07:43] <%yhom_tork> muffled sound PogChamp
[2:07:44] <JetpackMcQuack> shortcut to danger
[2:07:46] <+the_krypto_knight> I‚Äôm pretty sure the covenent tech advantage is kind of patchwork.
[2:07:46] <%DensityD> super dampened gun sounds
[2:07:50] <marshalmorphino2> Just fall through the floor
[2:07:51] <brambobelurkin> this mission...
[2:07:51] <+D00msDayDan> no, you're in a multiplayer map, the firefight map is the next room
[2:07:53] <FMsava> LUL
[2:07:53] <+emeraldstreak> yea we gundam now
[2:07:54] <APsaull> All or most of the covenant tech is found/repurposed isn‚Äôt it?
[2:07:54] <+SteelChairRun> @csng ah yes, distract them Limp Bizkit, the truest of war crimes bfgLaugh
[2:07:56] <Realimpact> Colonel Campbell?
[2:07:57] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:08:00] <%DensityD> Woolie wants EVEN MORE FLOATY controls
[2:08:00] <dinnydanny777> Yeah but humans are experts at espionage
[2:08:01] <JetpackMcQuack> SPACE Kreygasm
[2:08:05] <%DensityD> the juuuuuumps
[2:08:06] <TimetodiveLTX> why doesn't the gun thrust you backwards
[2:08:07] <+ItsRatman> did woolie just nut a little
[2:08:09] <%phatmac16> This map is the best multiplayer kne
[2:08:10] <%yhom_tork> space fucks
[2:08:10] <+the_krypto_knight> They are mostly just way bigger and have better warp drives/ ship shields
[2:08:11] <+shocknawful> your legs are the jetpack now
[2:08:13] <%Slimshazbot> Remember this is still the same mission as the beach storming section
[2:08:13] <+Darksolstace> Just blast Space Oddity on the broad band
[2:08:16] <%brachydios777> woolieGASM
[2:08:18] <+Haildrops> The covenant did make a bunch of their own stuff but they had laws against defiling forerunner relics so they never reverse engineered too much
[2:08:21] <%Cerberus_NV> Midship PogChamp
[2:08:22] <%phatmac16> This map in multiplayer Kreygasm
[2:08:27] <%DensityD> @TimetodiveLTX because video games and spartan armor
[2:08:28] <Reizie_Etherealm> Electronic warfare go down, WEAPONS GO UP
[2:08:29] <+CyanDeadEye> @Realimpact No, but in the Beta he was the Invasion gametype announcer
[2:08:31] <%doomerskeletor13> Man Savannah is such a normie name compared to the other ship names
[2:08:37] <%yhom_tork> THE GRENADE LUL
[2:08:40] <%derap41> Grenades work in space
[2:08:48] <+Pyroclase> frags would work in space
[2:08:51] <PrideOfFiddles> .... Doesn't make sense... hmmmm
[2:08:53] <herzogtheanimal> They didn't invent cool ship names until CE
[2:08:58] <+Haildrops> And they have no AI because AI was the downfall of the forerunners. Thanks Mendicant Bias
[2:08:58] <%yhom_tork> VERGIL
[2:09:01] <bricklordly> Hey, when does ODST firefight release? I know the actual game comes out next month, but weren't they releasing firefight this summer?
[2:09:04] <+Darksolstace> The Long Night of Solace makes up for the bad UNSC name.

[2:09:09] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> Woolie just stop getting shot Kappa

[2:09:43] <%subjectg> you know he‚Äôs not actually too far off
[2:09:44] <Onatamana> Woolie didn't even see it
[2:09:44] <Melchior_the_Wise> Engineers in Halo Wars right?
[2:09:44] <+GruntOfAction> the engineers are super passive though :C
[2:09:45] <+Haildrops> Don't give Woolie bad behaviours for ODST

[2:10:12] <gladsomepraetorian> You crossed a line, V.
[2:10:14] <%brave_sj> Hitler looked at the engineers and said "damn that's too far bro"
[2:10:14] <brambobelurkin> engineers were nice boys
[2:10:17] <Solidnick18> oh boy

[2:10:22] <Depthcharge2030> Shhh
[2:10:23] <zamzoph> my dad was killed by an Engineer
[2:10:23] <SpaceGuntank> focus rifle so cool, but its such a shit gun sadly
[2:10:29] <+Haildrops> I love the engineer naming scheme where it's based on their like, weight and buoyancy. So you get shit like "Heavier-than-most" and "Quick-to-adjust"
[2:10:35] <%jorniev> STARHAWK
[2:10:36] <gladsomepraetorian> Lighter Than Some.
[2:10:37] <ChernoMuncho> focus
[2:10:40] <karl_rex> Focus Rifle
[2:10:45] <herzogtheanimal> RIP Lighter Than Some the real homie
[2:10:45] <bricklordly> focus rifle, V. fake fan.
[2:10:51] <%superc37> it is objectively the worse weapon in the game
[2:10:51] <thesoldierofjoy> Focus rifle is cooler than it is effective.
[2:10:56] <%Halospaz117> Beam Rifle was the old gun, this is Focus Rifle
[2:10:59] <%DensityD> I can see woolie trying that advice from little V. he's not waiting for the reticle to turn red, he's taking those shots when it crosses
[2:11:01] <purekyun> halo halo

[2:15:44] <+Tacotouchdown> Reach covered in crators
[2:15:45] <%derap41> I mean earth like would be fitting for human life
[2:15:45] <squidmax1> Same thing on earth

[2:16:05] <Joestar1890> Reach is Earth 2

[2:16:08] <%Estuko> That's gotta be like, 12 gallons of water at least
[2:16:08] <DarkestDawn64> V too preoccupied with the flat Earth

[2:16:55] <%derap41> The gun you give to the one you in the squad that can hit his targets
[2:17:00] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Darksolstace like how they dont know their plasma lances on their ships have a power setting and the Forerunners defaulted it to minimum power
[2:17:02] <+Darksolstace> @queequegtheater happy birthday
[2:17:03] <%doomerskeletor13> It‚Äôs the last birthday they‚Äôll ever have
[2:17:10] <dinnydanny777> If Reach has those giant Yeti monsters on land I wonder what type of scary shit lives in that massive ocean
[2:17:10] <Exodusprime1256> time for ALL of us to go home

[2:17:40] <Sp3ctre48> I don't think the Covenant sucks when it has to fight on land, just the Spartans give the UNSC a big advantage

[2:18:11] <+Haildrops> The UNSC barely has any spartans left and they barely get deployed in actual battles

[2:19:09] <%ScreamLord> Plasma good for shields, ballistic good for health
[2:19:09] <bricklordly> The longer the Icon of Sin is on Reach, the stronger it becomes!
[2:19:09] <+Haildrops> yeah but Spartan 3s are only in SPI so they can only do so much

[2:19:47] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @dinnydanny777 spartans are part of the Navy, Master Chief is a navy rank
[2:19:47] <+shocknawful> Bob is dead :/ he was one week from retirement too
[2:19:49] <Melchior_the_Wise> why don't he pick it up"
[2:19:49] <%ScreamLord> @Haildrops Some Spartan-IIIs get Mjolnir but they have to earn it
[2:19:51] <SpaceGuntank> Plasma melts shields faster, Bullets deplete Health faster
[2:19:53] <%huskarl_zap> HyperHaste what is the conspiracy behind these emotes?
[2:19:54] <+Haildrops> I mean like 90% of the UNSC is marines, you only see Army troopers like once
[2:19:55] <ChernoMuncho> rip marine again
[2:19:56] <wahilliham> how have i never notice this song before
[2:20:00] <%subjectg> Man the gank squad in this room on legendary is something else
[2:20:07] <%DensityD> he's DOING GOOD with hologram
[2:20:08] <+Haildrops> @ScreamLord Yeah but it'll be like 10% of 300 at tops and it's mainly special teams like noble
[2:20:08] <%Estuko> LUL Has anyone seen the edit of the armor lock but the icon is just that self-suck image
[2:20:09] <biomegabear> I'm a sprint boy
[2:20:11] <%DensityD> sprint LUL
[2:20:13] <dinnydanny777> @queequegtheater That's what I mean though, even with the Spartans the Covenant arguably have a better navy
[2:20:18] <+Darksolstace> @screamlord yeah the majority get SPI armor.
[2:20:20] <friendlyrogue> fun fact: you can get into the pelican's gunner seat on this level
[2:20:21] <+Haildrops> And noble was pulled from Alpha company before they did the big mass suicide
[2:20:27] <$serpenttucker> The realest tech for hologram is using it JUST before someone is gonna try and lunge at you with a sword to intercept them
[2:20:44] <%subjectg> @friendlyrogue it‚Äôs practically the only way clearing this level on LASO solo too
[2:20:51] <%yhom_tork> GOOD DECOY

[2:22:05] <+QueequegTheater> Yeah, shoot that empty air
[2:22:10] <%brave_sj> secretly?
[2:22:10] <bricklordly> love how the plasma "rifle" doesn't look like what a human would call a "rifle"
[2:22:19] <%Estuko> I want the next room to be the nightclub from BLADE LUL
[2:22:23] <%ScreamLord> Also, IIRC Spartan-IIIs are just as strong and capable as IIs out of armor and can potentially become stronger the older they get as their bodies become more and more accustomed to their augments
[2:22:30] <+Darksolstace> @bricklordly it‚Äôs probably just a translation.
[2:22:30] <Onatamana> The Covenant unknowingly based their ship layouts off of Forerunner night club ships.
[2:22:31] <+D00msDayDan> mmm yeah drain that whole battery
[2:22:38] <biomegabear> is woolie playing on heroic chat?

[2:23:55] <marshalmorphino2> Nope
[2:23:56] <+CyanDeadEye> But with Mjolnir the difference is virtually unnoticable.

And even then a Spartan-II or III in GEN1 armor would still mop the floor with a IV because of how the strengthening methods of the GEN1 and GEN2. GEN1 makes you stronger the stronger you already are GEN2 just boosts you to the average strength of an Armored Spartan-II

They claim humans have destroyed Forerunner Artifacts but that's not an excuse because we dont know better. Hunters were eating Forerunner shit until the Covenant said "stop." they killed all the worms who refused to stop, and the ones that did stop are the Hunters we see now

[2:32:33] <%huskarl_zap> RATS WERE RATS
[2:32:34] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @LiquidDinosaur it kinda did go against their whole religion because their religion was based off of the covenant being the reclaimers to the forerunner. it's like if evangelical christians discovered a race of aliens that straight up God's humans and we found out we weren't or something
[2:32:35] <wibbwobbler> 9/11 stuff, kind of handled poorly lol

[2:33:25] <Torivore> Suicide grunts in Halo Wars get it the worst
[2:33:27] <+Tacotouchdown> Ashame ssince grunts are actually quick learners

[2:33:28] <+Haildrops> I assume they're hailing one of the orbital mac platforms but
[2:33:34] <+Walopoh> They rebelled once. ONCE.
[2:33:41] <Reizie_Etherealm> Isn't corvette one of the smaller classes? It's not even a cruiser
[2:33:44] <%doomerskeletor13> I wish one of the games would give us a Grunt buddy

[2:34:01] <+shocknawful> thyre in the old style dropships
[2:34:02] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @LiquidDinosaur yeah so if humans weren't the true inheritors they'd probably be absorbed by the covenant like everyone else
[2:34:02] <%LiquidDinosaur> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug they just see a wholesale genocide of a really useful species for seemingly no raison.

[2:34:31] <%Goraka91> I forgot Brutes were in Reach
[2:34:34] <+shocknawful> Jimmy Rustlers

[2:34:37] <%doomerskeletor13> They‚Äôre logging over the Spartans

[2:34:49] <%derap41> Armor Lock is crap in campaign
[2:34:49] <Sp3ctre48> So for large civilian centers like these, Brutes are deployed instead of the Elites

[2:34:51] <%raven_frame> It's an EMP effect.

[2:34:55] <%RioGascar> also the game apparently instantly game overs you if you shoot a civy
[2:34:55] <+slimmixrp> EMP
[2:34:56] <%DensityD> it's not an install
[2:34:56] <RahuHordika> It's an EMP pulse
[2:34:57] <+Darksolstace> @liquiddinosaur if Humanity were in the Covenant we‚Äôd just die because the Halo would go off.
[2:34:59] <+shocknawful> Brutes are assigned the bitch work

[2:35:03] <%Goraka91> @Sp3ctre48 Nice
[2:35:12] <+Haildrops> they probably weren't expecting much resistance, the brutes never seem that well geared outside of the chieftains
[2:35:14] <SpaceGuntank> Hold for invinciblity, hold longer for EMP.

[2:35:47] <%The_Swedish_X> Gotta brush off the morality to not start crying
[2:35:47] <Melchior_the_Wise> I'd like to imagine Brutes are used to destroy civilian centers because Elites have too much honor to slaughter defenseless civilians
[2:35:48] <JetpackMcQuack> another win for us
[2:35:50] <+jetjagger222> we're oscar mike
[2:35:51] <%derap41> Half the city is glass but I'm having a good time
[2:35:54] <dinnydanny777> But the Covenant are bad guys, so it's fine
[2:35:55] <%LiquidDinosaur> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug Or we'd be great engineers who make all their tech work better, mysteriusly. Like how in Warhammer 40k, the Squats are said to be really good at "talking to the Machine Spirits" but thats just because Squat society never forgot how technology works or started worshipping it. So they can just repair things without pointless chanting or incense

[2:36:54] <%Goraka91> @doomerskeletor13 Also didn't they nuke each other hence the homeworld being shite?
[2:36:54] <+sir_louis> 0
[2:36:55] <+QueequegTheater> PICK UP THE GUN
[2:36:55] <KillMyPast> ?????
[2:36:56] <Reizie_Etherealm> I'm stuck? *reverse uno card*
[2:36:58] <%BisoromiBear> mauler time
[2:36:58] <%Andrizzleton> pretty much pick up a weapon when you see one...
[2:37:00] <Solidnick18> GET GUN
[2:37:03] <PrideOfFiddles> Out of ammo doesn't pick up weapon from guy he just killed...
[2:37:03] <thesoldierofjoy> GUN
[2:37:03] <%ChoculaUltra> armor locking against a dude in a ghost trying to splatter you tho? insta nut
[2:37:04] <prime_name> Woolie dislikes Brute guns
[2:37:07] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Darksolstace Maybe we'd have increased covenant access to Forerunner information and we'd be like "wait guys, this terminal in this Forerunner building is implying some weird shit about the Great Journey"
[2:37:07] <+Tacotouchdown> No bullets
[2:37:09] <purekyun> activate
[2:37:09] <ChernoMuncho> thats a big mauler
[2:37:11] <%ScreamLord> Sometimes you can even throw a stick back at them with Armor Lock
[2:37:15] <%doomerskeletor13> @goraka91 Yeah they‚Äôre basically Mad Max aliens
[2:37:17] <%MrAtheGreat> The "You didn't win button."
[2:37:32] <%yhom_tork> big odst energy
[2:37:35] <%derap41> It eats the grenades
[2:37:35] <JetpackMcQuack> damage = off
[2:37:36] <%Goraka91> @doomerskeletor13 Imagine having a race war over beards
[2:37:42] <%jorniev> @screamlord that is awesome
[2:37:42] <idiotscampaign> Rockets ricochet off
[2:37:42] <%The_Swedish_X> Even a tank shot
[2:37:43] <thesoldierofjoy> It can take literally anything
[2:37:45] <%derap41> MY MAN
[2:37:46] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Darksolstace like i dont think humans would ever really be 100% onboard with blind Forerunner reverence, even if they suppress our existing relgions. We'd probably not just ignore any Monitors etc
[2:37:47] <+Haildrops> the "I couldn't succeed at what i'm doing" button
[2:37:48] <Louie_Salmon> "I'M FUCKIN' INVINCIBLE"
[2:37:48] <+QueequegTheater> Oh god we gave Woolie Royal Guard
[2:37:48] <Onatamana> Maybe Jorge survived the slipspace bomb by armor locking
[2:37:49] <invalidarg56> it qlso reflect fuel rods right?
[2:37:50] <Melchior_the_Wise> If you armor lock after you get stuck, I believe it yets the grenade off you
[2:37:54] <Melchior_the_Wise> Yeets
[2:37:56] <%derap41> The legend himself
[2:37:56] <%RioGascar> aka : defend this objective on a timer

[2:38:17] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @LiquidDinosaur if anything we'd probably be more like Jackals where we're just like "yeah sure we believe your religion whatever just don't kill us and give us money"
[2:38:18] <%Javaa01> It flings off Plasma Nades
[2:38:18] <pochecito> yes
[2:38:18] <%unclekulikov> try it
[2:38:18] <+Haildrops> If it doesn't it won't kill you either way so it's safew

[2:38:19] <%Genis94> It does protect you from it, yes.
[2:38:20] <JetpackMcQuack> I remember some propulsion tech

[2:38:21] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> yeyeyyee
[2:38:21] <+Pyroclase> universe says yes
[2:38:21] <+GruntOfAction> If you get stuck and armor lock it pops it off

[2:38:22] <slix3431> I have a good feeling about evacing these civilians
[2:38:23] <%hattrick61> y
[2:38:24] <%brachydios777> Yes

[2:38:32] <%The_Swedish_X> hammer time
[2:38:33] <idiotscampaign> i've seen many halo clips where people got double kills that way
[2:38:34] <+duskrush> ah damn it I missed Jorge
[2:38:37] <%raven_frame> Why ask?
[2:38:38] <%Genis94> You can also use the evade ability to stick your head in a wall if you get stuck that way and it will block the explosion.
[2:38:41] <%yhom_tork> BOP
[2:38:41] <Jashter18> No given Woolie JUST did that
[2:38:42] <dinnydanny777> Universe is perpetually both correct and wrong
[2:38:42] <%Goraka91> @Tacotouchdown That was ODST I think
[2:38:43] <%Slimshazbot> LUL
[2:38:43] <%derap41> Now what
[2:38:44] <+cursedwithadhd> nades shouldn't stick so the goal is to throw at the feet
[2:38:45] <+D00msDayDan> hey V you should stick woolie and find out
[2:38:47] <%huskarl_zap> yeah fuk /v/ Kappa
[2:38:48] <JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[2:38:50] <Baziiiinga> You can find out by sticking woolie yourself V!
[2:38:52] <%BisoromiBear> you thought
[2:38:53] <%dekkitout> HARD READ
[2:38:54] <%ChoculaUltra> that Brute knows the match-up LUL
[2:38:54] <ChernoMuncho> get that hammer
[2:38:56] <JayPastaForce> He checked woolie out
[2:38:56] <%Gruhunchously> It's that Darth Maul moment
[2:38:56] <Solidnick18> hammmerrrr
[2:38:58] <Louie_Salmon> Yes if you get stuck, THEN armor lock, the grenade pops back off of you.
[2:38:58] <%Feralspirit41> Big grav hammer boys
[2:39:01] <Reizie_Etherealm> Stick woolie to find out LUL
[2:39:02] <fault_417> If you‚Äôre lucky enough to survive the initial elite ground invasion you have to deal with the brutes cleaning up
[2:39:03] <Baziiiinga> STICK WOOL
[2:39:06] <%huskarl_zap> wario>mario
[2:39:09] <%LiquidDinosaur> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug wait, are Jackals even "part of the covenant" or not.
[2:39:09] <Sp3ctre48> I do like lore wise that the Brutes get the really shitty equipment and no shields because the elites hate them
[2:39:12] <%derap41> Woolie is turning in to the worst kinda of MP player
[2:39:12] <%doomerskeletor13> Mario has committed many war crimes
[2:39:13] <+Haildrops> You can't assassinate the Brutes unless they don't know you're there to counteract them being so easy to kill in Halo 3
[2:39:21] <JetpackMcQuack> This ability also fills you with fake confidence
[2:39:25] <PrideOfFiddles> He still thinks he gets shield back from Armor lock wut

[2:39:40] <infernalram> music is off time?
[2:39:41] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @LiquidDinosaur Jackals are primarily mercenaries but the covenant is a huge theocracy so they have to "be part of it" so they don't get killed
[2:39:45] <+GruntOfAction> @PrideOfFiddles Shhh let him dream
[2:39:51] <+shocknawful> Fun fact: Brutes have ladders on their ships rather than grav lifts
[2:39:53] <%Goraka91> @LiquidDinosaur Yeah, though they do some freelance 'privateering' on the side
[2:39:54] <TrigglyPuf> Woolie going brute loadout
[2:39:54] <%Javaa01> Yeah, it's a rocket powered hammer
[2:39:57] <purekyun> big sword
[2:39:58] <PrideOfFiddles> @GruntOfAction You're right it's better this way :)
[2:39:59] <%subjectg> @derap41 those kinds of people are pretty easy to deal with without support
[2:40:02] <%jorniev> Johnson?
[2:40:06] <dinnydanny777> This piano though
[2:40:07] <%Gruhunchously> Barbarian Hammer
[2:40:12] <%RioGascar> a lot of brute tech is unclean and barbaic
[2:40:12] <+Haildrops> Jackal captains basically steal covenant ships whenever they get the chance
[2:40:14] <%RioGascar> its great
[2:40:14] <SixthSun2> Dem Brutes know cool shit
[2:40:14] <jaygee303> Did Woolie‚Äôs cry when Jorge died
[2:40:14] <%derap41> @subjectg Yeah but theyy're still a pain
[2:40:16] <%LiquidDinosaur> why do you use the blunt end? isnt the other side an axe?
[2:40:16] <%brachydios777> It‚Äôs not Johnson

[2:42:50] <%Slimshazbot> Yeah I hope Woolie gives Space Marine a shot one day

[2:42:54] <%huskarl_zap> 2 not one
[2:42:56] <%The_Swedish_X> Welcome to the Bullfrogs: we'll jetpack into a pit at the drop of a hat.
[2:42:59] <SpaceGuntank> there was another skull here IIRC, you had to leap on top of a shipping container to get it or something.

[2:43:23] <%LiquidDinosaur> @jetjagger222 though if Lil V gets mad about nerds over-eager to share irrelevent lore for HALO I dont even fucking want to think about how a 40k game would go down
[2:43:25] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> I forgot that the bullfrogs literally kill themselves by falling to death...
[2:43:27] <%huskarl_zap> much as I want to stan Titus it's only 6 hours
[2:43:28] <+Haildrops> @Goraka91 The ODSTs hate the SIIs because John got into a fight with a bunch of them when he was young and he killed like 3 of them.
[2:43:30] <+RaveBV> YAY
[2:43:36] <%Josef_Stryker> YAAAAAY
[2:43:38] <%Gruhunchously> Brute comes to hammer his corpse
[2:43:41] <+Tacotouchdown> ODST 's mad that their armor doesn't cost as m uch as a starship
[2:43:58] <+jetjagger222> @LiquidDinosaur lol its already been happening and this isn't a 40k game
[2:43:58] <+D00msDayDan> ODSTs are jealous because they don't want to be replaced by spartans
[2:44:01] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Haildrops @Goraka91 yeah they're salty that 3 ODSTs picked a fight with a single 15 year old Spartan and fucking died like bitches
[2:44:03] <%doomerskeletor13> I think ODST armor doesn‚Äôt incorporate some MJOLNIR tech
[2:44:04] <dinnydanny777> @tacotouchdown That's a decent reason to be mad though

[2:45:16] <%Feralspirit41> ODSTs have nathan fillion what do spartans have
[2:45:23] <+D00msDayDan> @LiquidDinosaur the cole protocol calls this maneuver STEEL REHN
[2:45:26] <Solidnick18> @BallerSwagBro9k sick

[2:46:02] <%doomerskeletor13> New Batman game this week boys

[2:46:38] <%doomerskeletor13> @huskarl_zap New game about the Court Of Owls, trailer on Friday
[2:46:39] <Torivore> Spartan IVs are the coolest because it's all the badass of an ODST + Mjolnir armor
[2:46:46] <+Tacotouchdown> Spartan 4s are literally augmented ODST'S
[2:46:50] <%doomerskeletor13> @torivore Agreed

[2:46:56] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Reizie_Etherealm i mean i assume there's only so much bone and muscle augmentation you can do to postpubesscent people
[2:46:57] <%Halospaz117> @BallerSwagBro9k Ok, not exactly announced, but this is still something
[2:47:03] <dinnydanny777> Why is modern video game announcement having your game leaked on Amazon UK/on a Guatemalan Retail website
[2:47:10] <%RioGascar> i have read these and still have no clue what most of it is talking about from a grand scale
[2:47:11] <%huskarl_zap> spartan 4s are desk secretaries lul

[2:48:58] <%DensityD> A BOOK
[2:48:59] <Reizie_Etherealm> If you replace ODSTs with Spartan IVs, do you think it'd be ok to replace marines with ODSTs?
[2:49:07] <+Tacotouchdown> aren't the AI talking to each other now

[2:49:14] <%doomerskeletor13> Secret AI shadow council of humanity
[2:49:16] <+Haildrops> I mean marines are basically just any random goon, ODSTs have al lthe special training
[2:49:21] <%derap41> Not really
[2:49:21] <%LiquidDinosaur> what kind of ranks do ODSTs have? are they Navy?
[2:49:22] <miscxx> Does Woolie know Marlo stanfield left Baltimore and became a spartan?
[2:49:24] <%huskarl_zap> is commencing
[2:49:26] <Solidnick18> nope
[2:49:27] <%Slimshazbot> They are so damn right
[2:49:29] <+D00msDayDan> @Reizie_Etherealm ODSTs are still a thing because despite how streamlined the process is IVs are still expensive as fuck
[2:49:33] <%yhom_tork> AI voting seems weird to me LUL
[2:49:34] <%LiquidDinosaur> are ODSTs navy or marine corps
[2:49:35] <+mans51> give humanity a fighting chance against covenant?
[2:49:36] <dinnydanny777> Humans are dumb
[2:49:39] <+Darksolstace> They are right
[2:49:40] <+Tacotouchdown> Spartan IV's are just a promotion for the best ODST's
[2:49:41] <%subjectg> @liquiddinosaur still marines, normal ranks apply
[2:49:45] <%RioGascar> AI voting seems...pointless to me
[2:49:48] <%derap41> We are Legion for We are many
[2:49:53] <Onatamana> We gave the robots democracy
[2:49:55] <%subjectg> @liquiddinosaur only spartans hold naval ranks afaik

[2:50:21] <wibbwobbler> i think about this all the time. we really don't know if a secret a.i currently exists and is in hiding
[2:50:26] <Breaburn_op> yall think the Geth would hold elections?
[2:50:28] <%derap41> Perspective changes behavior
[2:50:28] <%Theycallmenerf> Wouldn‚Äôt the AI just go off of percentage of success and choose the best result of success?
[2:50:28] <%DensityD> woring part LUL
[2:50:32] <+RaveBV> If AI learning works the same way as machine learning in computers then AI voting makes perfect sense.
[2:50:32] <+jetjagger222> what if they had one AI specifically to say no
[2:50:32] <+Juriasu> Magi from evangelion
[2:50:33] <%DensityD> worrying
[2:50:33] <DarkestDawn64> And Auntie Dot
[2:50:40] <dinnydanny777> Wouldn't AI be better at voting than Humans though
[2:50:43] <+RaveBV> Each AI would have a different POV from how it personally learned.
[2:50:46] <+Haildrops> Dot is a dumb AI so she's different
[2:50:47] <dinnydanny777> More objective, at least
[2:50:53] <%derap41> Bobiverse that's all I'm saying
[2:50:54] <+ItsRatman> lets just pretend guilty spark doesnt exist
[2:50:54] <%Slimshazbot> AUNTIE is a "dumb ai", not a truly sentient one
[2:50:57] <%doomerskeletor13> I think the Majority/Minority of the Assemblies have different priorities
[2:50:58] <%LiquidDinosaur> Dumb AI are not people
[2:51:01] <+Darksolstace> Auntie Dot isn‚Äôt fully sentient
[2:51:02] <+shocknawful> Cortona is very advanced and special
[2:51:03] <marshalmorphino2> Cortana was a lot of things to a lot of people
[2:51:06] <+Walopoh> not all AI is sentient
[2:51:08] <%LiquidDinosaur> Dumb AI are just cool computers. Smart AI are people
[2:51:12] <TimetodiveLTX> cortana's creation was kind of unique
[2:51:14] <%huskarl_zap> Bug Auntie is watching you.
[2:51:17] <Solidnick18> it's ok V
[2:51:17] <+Haildrops> They have programmed personalities but they don't have the humanness that the Smart AIs have
[2:51:17] <%doomerskeletor13> Yeah Dot is dumb ai
[2:51:20] <+Tacotouchdown> auntie Dot is the same level of amazon Alexa
[2:51:22] <%superc37> she was also really fkin hot
[2:51:25] <%DensityD> WHACK A MOLE
[2:51:29] <+Toblo1> Dot is more akin to a Mass Effect VI rather than a full AI
[2:51:37] <%The_Swedish_X> there's a sniper rifle around here

[2:51:51] <%ScreamLord> Dumb A.I can't learn new things Smart A.I can learn a grow but it makes them eventually go insane
[2:51:56] <%Slimshazbot> The AI/VI thing is a good way of putting it for people familair with Mass Effect
[2:51:57] <dinnydanny777> Reach has a worrying lack of Cortana butt
[2:52:04] <Breaburn_op> It's the 2nd floor behind Woolie rn

[2:57:47] <%derap41> ODSTs!
[2:57:47] <%LiquidDinosaur> @brachydios777 mind you "higher standing" isnt like a 1:1 thing. Like, Lt. is the lowest officer. Master Chief is the highest possible naval enlisted, and Johnson's a Sgt Major which is the equivalent for Marines/Army. A Lt. "COULD" give orders to a Master Chief, but when they did they'd get the shit kicked out of them and they'd never do it again
[2:57:50] <bricklordly> SourPls
[2:57:50] <%yhom_tork> sick level
[2:57:51] <jaygee303> The stafe
[2:57:54] <%The_Swedish_X> Time to see the horror of this invasion.

[2:58:23] <%Feralspirit41> This whole game on legendary is rough
[2:58:23] <%yhom_tork> sure Kappa
[2:58:27] <bricklordly> never should have come here
[2:58:27] <%superc37> SHOOT THEM
[2:58:31] <+Darksolstace> @liquiddinosaur Chief would probably follow Six‚Äôs orders though as long as they weren‚Äôt awful
[2:58:32] <%derap41> You can gun down the civis there
[2:58:40] <marshalmorphino2> They‚Äôll be fine
[2:58:51] <ChernoMuncho> you bad guy for wanting to help civilians
[2:58:51] <friendlyrogue> terrible soldiers, good people
[2:58:54] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Darksolstace the important part is, Noble 6 would acknowledge that John Halo is much, much, much more experienced than he is
[2:58:55] <dinnydanny777> Do you feel like a hero yet?
[2:58:58] <JetpackMcQuack> That's what normally happens
[2:58:59] <%doomerskeletor13> Yeah this is basically like the evacuation of Vietnam
[2:59:01] <LoganPayne> Insubordination in the face of bad orders is good soldiering
[2:59:08] <%Slimshazbot> Sometime you need to be a bad soldier to be a good person
[2:59:13] <+RaveBV> Let's count how much times Woolie kills normal soldiers.
[2:59:15] <Reizie_Etherealm> How much cohones do you need to have to disobey an order to retreat and save yourselves, in order to save others
[2:59:16] <Minerslovegames> I'll face a tribunal when it's all done, idgaf.
[2:59:17] <JayPastaForce> Warcrimes Woolie
[2:59:24] <%derap41> Man this does not follow the rules of engagement

[2:59:27] <thesoldierofjoy> "1v1 ME" screamed the man in a helicopter chaingun
[2:59:28] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Darksolstace one of those situation where John would suggest to an Lt what they should do and the Lt would say "yes do that"
[2:59:30] <LoganPayne> Woolie listen to the radio
[2:59:31] <%doomerskeletor13> A soldier follows orders, a hero does what‚Äôs right ItsHappening

[2:59:53] <%RioGascar> i believe in actual cases of insubordiaiton in acts of valor have peoples "awol" status get ignored cause they did heroic acts

[3:09:38] <Goodvibes99508> Spartans don't die
[3:09:40] <Sp3ctre48> This is the best level for sure imo
[3:09:41] <%phatmac16> FAV LEVEL
[3:09:42] <%vaderxyz1970> NVM
[3:09:42] <REGNIERx> Whats the difference between spartan 2s and 3s?
[3:09:42] <%doomerskeletor13> Give them to... Halsey? LUL
[3:09:44] <RamenRiderZ> Big sad
[3:09:44] <%CappuccinoGuil> But Woolie.... YOU were his family.
[3:09:46] <%brave_sj> Used to confirm death, except you'll be listed as MIA anyways
[3:09:47] <Joestar1890> Jorge was an orphan tho
[3:09:50] <%Gruhunchously> Yeah, we're sorry that your child that we kidnapped and pressed into service was killed. Here's some tags
[3:09:50] <turbofolk> i hope they get the easter eggs
[3:09:51] <Reizie_Etherealm> Are ya winning son?
[3:09:51] <+GruntOfAction> I hope they do the trick to turn the ships into phantoms/pelicans

[3:09:53] <%derap41> Can't stop all this winning
[3:09:54] <%Feralspirit41> Nah thats victory decimation
[3:09:54] <%raven_frame> Love this level, real ODST vibes.
[3:09:54] <%RioGascar> this moment was: "marty you are gonna have to carry this whole cutscene on your own with music...good luck"
[3:09:56] <SpaceGuntank> spartans don't die, they just go missing in action.
[3:09:56] <LoganPayne> We're losing so good, gurl
[3:09:58] <%The_Swedish_X> This has been a long day
[3:09:59] <%LiquidDinosaur> @rowboat_girlyman probably cant donate Spartan blood its probably full of weird shit that would kill a normal human
[3:09:59] <%Javaa01> I mean, is it brooding or just being visibly fucking tired from doing what, 3 days or fighting straight?
[3:09:59] <%yhom_tork> cant stop winning
[3:10:00] <%MaddyCaddy> It's mostly for records so they know who's dead
[3:10:00] <%doomerskeletor13> Jorge is a Spartan 2 guys
[3:10:00] <biomegabear> worst level in the game right here
[3:10:04] <pochecito> Are ya winning spartan?
[3:10:06] <+jetjagger222> even the helmet looks sad
[3:10:07] <+RaveBV> Real ODST feels with this
[3:10:07] <+RhymesWithWasabi> time for the cool level
[3:10:09] <bricklordly> big sad
[3:10:10] <ZeroCruz> Jorge was NOT AN ORPHAN
[3:10:13] <Nomad94> I forgot about the easter eggs in this
[3:10:13] <TigerClaws12> the otter hat
[3:10:13] <hyphenated_q> "Hey guess what, your son died again! Cool huh!?"
[3:10:14] <%derap41> Otter hat
[3:10:14] <%huskarl_zap> jin moves into cause as many casualties to hurt mongol morale
[3:10:17] <%yhom_tork> YEYEYEYEY
[3:10:18] <Second_Omega> Are ya winnin humanity
[3:10:21] <%MacabreOpus> like a Saints Row game
[3:10:22] <Sullry> dude walked for like 5 days straight and is still fighting
[3:10:22] <dinnydanny777> We saved the city!
[3:10:24] <%LiquidDinosaur> @ZeroCruz yeah but his parents assume eh just died of cancer as a little kid
[3:10:25] <%alpacasintophats> time for easter eggs or we calling it here?

[3:10:30] <dinnydanny777> We did it! We saved the city!
[3:10:32] <+shocknawful> All Spartans are officially marked as MIA upon death
[3:10:33] <%Gruhunchously> Hey, Camera! Come back!
[3:10:36] <%GrumbleGrouse> this is an annoying level
[3:10:37] <Nomad94> the Otter hat
[3:10:41] <%derap41> They're using Rasberries the bastards

[3:11:01] <%Feralspirit41> Why does every spartan walk in a way that sways their hips sexily
[3:11:01] <%doomerskeletor13> ‚ÄúReach was Johns home, it would not fall‚Äù Uh oh John
[3:11:03] <Reizie_Etherealm> That scene is especially impactful in Japanese
[3:11:04] <%LiquidDinosaur> @ZeroCruz man i bet there's some Oncologist who noted a weird cropping up of childhood cancers that were really weird and had no warnings, and then ONI would kill him for getting too close
[3:11:23] <%alpacasintophats> did it skip for anyone else?
[3:11:23] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts

[3:11:31] <ghoulishcripple> you gotta be twice the Spartan now 6. literally. with Jorge gone we need a new "Thicc boy" so start eating 6
[3:11:32] <+OniOniOniiii> i remember being hyped about this missions title
[3:11:32] <wahilliham> this mission is neat because its rougelike
[3:11:40] <Minerslovegames> Woolie's flying game is pretty on point
[3:11:41] <%CappuccinoGuil> @doomerskeletor13 I see you're using that quote from a book called "The fall of Reach"
[3:11:46] <%The_Swedish_X> Welcome to the city.
[3:11:47] <%LiquidDinosaur> @RioGascar Explosives planted at the base. UNSC did Reach
[3:11:54] <+RowenCleric> how is this mission roguelike
[3:11:56] <APegForReggie> RAVE TIME
[3:11:57] <biomegabear> LASO on this is a nightmare
[3:12:00] <dinnydanny777> @ghoulishcripple Kat is the new thicc boi
[3:12:02] <%RioGascar> its a weird mission
[3:12:02] <%unclekulikov> Trigger to hover.
[3:12:06] <%brave_sj> I hope they do the dance club Easter egg
[3:12:07] <%doomerskeletor13> @cappuccinoguil Yeah I‚Äôm quoting that BDG video that V talked about
[3:12:08] <+Pyroclase> Holy shit, they're doing WORK
[3:12:11] <%The_Swedish_X> Longest mission next to Library.
[3:12:12] <+Darksolstace> @rowencleric you get a lot of random events in this
[3:12:15] <%Gruhunchously> Stick with Trigger and you'll make it!
[3:12:20] <infernalram> @rowencleric objectives are in randimized order
[3:12:22] <%The_Swedish_X> Moreso than library, really
[3:12:23] <ChernoMuncho> is woolie going to forget the lock altitude feature?

[3:12:31] <%subjectg> I wonder what that big ol ‚ÄúLock altitude‚Äù button is?
[3:12:35] <%RioGascar> this was bungies love letter to the fans
[3:12:43] <+Tacotouchdown> if you quit the game here the main menu art looks sickness this level
[3:12:43] <ghoulishcripple> @dinnydanny777 cat doesn't have the right headspace to be a thicc boy
[3:12:43] <dinnydanny777> Now this part is like Ace Combat

[3:18:36] <%condemned_15> #GirlWood
[3:18:36] <+A_mere_shrubb> Should be mentioned that brutes before the events of 2 were kinda just the pillagers/raiders of the covenant
[3:18:41] <+Tacotouchdown> she's my favorite cringe host
[3:18:47] <+A_mere_shrubb> which is why we only see them in the city
[3:18:47] <%doomerskeletor13> Their are a lot of special guest VAs in this game

[3:19:16] <Second_Omega> Can‚Äôt wait for never surrender
[3:19:19] <Dragonborn983> Wow it's almost like Brutes are bastards
[3:19:25] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Tacotouchdown does Joel McHale count? I like how even if he knows nothing about the video game community he can sense the bullshit and give an appropriately low amount of fucks
[3:19:25] <%Irridium> there she is
[3:19:28] <%derap41> All Brutes are bastards
[3:19:30] <%threeheadedwalrus> Every voice in this game is just Mark Hamill pitch shifted
[3:19:33] <+TyeTheCzar> Yeah so Emiya is now on FX
[3:19:36] <%BurdRightsActivist> ROAR OF EARTH MORE LIKE
[3:19:37] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> NO ass whatsoever, she even admitted it.

[3:19:39] <%BurdRightsActivist> ROAR OF DEAD LOL
[3:19:41] <+gitgouda> @threeheadedwalrus as it should be
[3:19:46] <%doomerskeletor13> Man I‚Äôd love Mark Hamill in a Halo game lmao
[3:19:48] <+Juriasu> bring back mr coffee
[3:19:48] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Tacotouchdown or how he didnt know you arent supposed to ask Tim Schaffer about budget things
[3:19:49] <%derap41> When it was Cringe
[3:19:50] <%Andrizzleton> Girlwood
[3:19:51] <DatAsuna> Remember that one E3 she co-hosted with tobuscus and it was super cringe?
[3:19:54] <Solidnick18> yep
[3:19:56] <%RioGascar> and very...forced memes
[3:19:59] <%doomerskeletor13> Bless you Aisha Tyler
[3:20:01] <@Moobot> Easy with the emojis @misterurbanthelegend
[3:20:04] <Melchior_the_Wise> Gooby Please
[3:20:08] <%RioGascar> reach was 2010
[3:20:11] <turbofolk> @datasuna oh god shut up shut up
[3:20:13] <%Andrizzleton> before
[3:20:16] <dinnydanny777> Probably before?
[3:20:16] <+GruntOfAction> Reach was september 2010 yeah
[3:20:19] <%RioGascar> probably made in...2009 dev wise?
[3:20:19] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> Around season 2 or 3
[3:20:22] <Tryhardblackguy> before, she was in the Reach beta video too
[3:20:23] <%brachydios777> 2010
[3:20:24] <%RioGascar> maybe later
[3:20:27] <Sp3ctre48> Has it really been 10 years since Reach FeelsBadMan
[3:20:32] <%subjectg> Remember when Ninja did skits with the Muppets?
[3:20:32] <%LiquidDinosaur> Wait who is she playing
[3:20:33] <DatAsuna> @turbofolk No you will remember the anti-charisma
[3:20:35] <SpaceGuntank> one day woolie will learn not to spam the trigger for better accuracy, but i dont see it happening anytime soon.
[3:20:39] <RamenRiderZ> PETJACK
[3:20:40] <%Andrizzleton> Member Reach?
[3:20:42] <%doomerskeletor13> She‚Äôs just some rando soldier
[3:20:44] <DatAsuna> Aisha getting visibly uncomfortable on stage
[3:20:44] <%condemned_15> PogChamp Jetpack
[3:20:44] <Sp3ctre48> God this game came out when I was 12 NotLikeThis
[3:20:45] <%LiquidDinosaur> what year was she at E3
[3:20:46] <%threeheadedwalrus> @LiquidDinosaur generic human grunt
[3:20:47] <$whiskeybuisness> @LiquidDinosaur marine number 31
[3:20:49] <+GruntOfAction> This game looks good for 2010 tbh
[3:20:51] <+Tacotouchdown> @liquiddinosaur off he plays cod and assassin creed
[3:20:52] <%superc37> whatever happened to aisha tyler anyways
[3:21:00] <%doomerskeletor13> She‚Äôs still doing stuff
[3:21:04] <clintsterlock> Did woolie do odst?
[3:21:07] <%RioGascar> no
[3:21:07] <Sp3ctre48> no
[3:21:09] <%doomerskeletor13> Not yet
[3:21:09] <Dragonborn983> no
[3:21:11] <%Slimshazbot> @clintsterlock Not on PC yet

[3:21:24] <misterurbanthelegend> Never used emojis.
[3:21:25] <clintsterlock> Thanks chat
[3:21:25] <stormhawk9891> Woolie
[3:21:29] <Reizie_Etherealm> We haven't gotten a date for ODST on the MCC yet right?
[3:21:32] <+jetjagger222> so this was aroudn the time of CODBLOPS1
[3:21:37] <FiendishlyInventive> Woolie's gonna love Guardians and I hate it.
[3:21:38] <%Slimshazbot> Soon (tm)
[3:21:42] <+JingKaisean> deaaaaanger zooooneeee
[3:21:42] <%The_Swedish_X> AI are dumb with a capital B
[3:21:43] <bricklordly> next month I think
[3:21:43] <johnybeefu> haHAA
[3:21:44] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Tacotouchdown ikay that's fine. Im not even trying to be all gamer elitist. I just mean, if you just play games like that you wont know as a matter of course that Tim Shaffer is notoriously terrible at managing budgets so maybe dont ask how much Kickstarter money he wasted on Elijah WOod
[3:21:44] <+Tacotouchdown> ODST is in beta from what ive sedn
[3:21:50] <+Tacotouchdown> seen*
[3:21:53] <%doomerskeletor13> LANAAAAA
[3:21:54] <%brachydios777> Danger zone
[3:21:59] <Zohare> I think you can only shoot through the deployable cover in halo 3
[3:22:01] <+mans51> well I'll be, she's still alive
[3:22:03] <ChernoMuncho> @FiendishlyInventive same, if he does
[3:22:03] <+JingKaisean> can lana dual weild cause of her massive oven mitts she calls hands?
[3:22:04] <+CyanDeadEye> Lana doesn't have her TEC-9
[3:22:06] <%RioGascar> you can recruit her i think
[3:22:08] <raikagelord1> Who is Lana?
[3:22:10] <Reizie_Etherealm> I actually want Woolie to like Guardians
[3:22:10] <%doomerskeletor13> can you imagine if Noble Six was voiced by Archer
[3:22:13] <Vek___> ODST is in flighting right now, so we'll likely get it Soon(tm)
[3:22:20] <%Halospaz117> @raikagelord1 Archer character
[3:22:23] <%brachydios777> @raikagelord1 Archer character
[3:22:26] <%superc37> woolie that was never a thing
[3:22:27] <misterurbanthelegend> ...Danger Zone!
[3:22:29] <biomegabear> @raikagelord1 archer charwcter
[3:22:31] <FiendishlyInventive> Only in H2/3 and ODST.
[3:22:31] <+D00msDayDan> why would the covenant use shields that human weapons could shoot through?
[3:22:32] <$serpenttucker> I dropped off at vice
[3:22:32] <%Gruhunchously> Why would Covenant shields be penetrable by human weapons?
[3:22:33] <Sp3ctre48> You gotta wonder how much more effective the Covenant ground forces would be if the Elites and Brutes fought together
[3:22:34] <Explodincatz> na u can stop at season 5
[3:22:34] <%MrAtheGreat> Seaoson 11 starts this sept iirc
[3:22:36] <%MajoraZ> @WoolieVersus only in Halo 2 with the equipment versoion @superc37 see above
[3:22:39] <ZeroCruz> ODST is coming soon
[3:22:39] <%MajoraZ> *Halo 3
[3:22:43] <%phatmac16> I dropped off at Vice
[3:22:47] <%subjectg> @liquiddinosaur my favorite tim schafer fact is that Star Wars Racer has a special thing where he‚Äôs credited as ‚ÄúNever tried to actively sabotage the project‚Äù.
[3:22:48] <ghoulishcripple> adventure island is the season I said I was done
[3:22:48] <%Irridium> I dropped off at the, uh... alternate universe seasons
[3:22:49] <raikagelord1> @brachydios777 ahhh thank you.
[3:22:50] <%doomerskeletor13> I need to catch up on it too
[3:22:51] <+CyanDeadEye> Archer 1999
[3:22:52] <%condemned_15> Dreamland, Danger Island, 1999
[3:22:58] <+Pyroclase> ARcher went into space??
[3:22:59] <+Tacotouchdown> I like aisha Tyler because she constantly comes back and was at E3 alot
[3:23:02] <%MrAtheGreat> It gets into a slog after the noir series
[3:23:02] <%Slimshazbot> I watched season 1 and 2 :)
[3:23:07] <%jorniev> Dreamland was pretty fun
[3:23:10] <%Pop_O_Matic> You stopped in a good place, Woolie. Show goes down hill once the coma seasons start.
[3:23:10] <FiendishlyInventive> LAST SEASON
[3:23:14] <+Tacotouchdown> final season of archer
[3:23:19] <+Tacotouchdown> No more filler
[3:23:20] <%doomerskeletor13> Last one I think
[3:23:23] <UltraBulldozer> Just like all TV shows it overstays its welcome
[3:23:25] <Reizie_Etherealm> I can't tell if Woolie's OH JESUS'ing at the conversation or the concussion rifle spam
[3:23:28] <%LiquidDinosaur> Wait how many seasons did WOolie see
[3:23:37] <%yhom_tork> lionFeels F
[3:23:38] <%jorniev> island was good right at the end
[3:23:39] <%Gruhunchously> They got Lana
[3:23:39] <%doomerskeletor13> He left off on Vice
[3:23:40] <ghoulishcripple> Dreamland was super depressing. it ended with a tribute to Woodhouses VA who died during creation
[3:23:40] <$serpenttucker> TBF the concussion rifle is never fun to deal with
[3:23:43] <%Josef_Stryker> LANAAAAAAAAAA
[3:23:47] <%brachydios777> @ultrabulldozer It‚Äôs having it‚Äôs final season
[3:23:48] <%BurdRightsActivist> GOT A FEW GOOD HITS IN THO
[3:23:48] <Phort909> F
[3:23:48] <%jorniev> space one was not fun
[3:23:49] <slix3431> LANAAAAAA
[3:23:50] <+Tacotouchdown> Archer was waiting for the manga to finish
[3:23:51] <%brave_sj> I can't believe Lana is fucking dead
[3:23:53] <%RioGascar> reload checkpoint
[3:23:53] <UltraBulldozer> thank god
[3:23:54] <%doomerskeletor13> LANAAA brownFEELS
[3:23:54] <Reizie_Etherealm> On normal maybe
[3:23:55] <%Josef_Stryker> DANGER ZONE
[3:23:56] <FiendishlyInventive> Woolie should watch DARK instead.
[3:23:58] <%brachydios777> F
[3:24:01] <%LiquidDinosaur> @ghoulishcripple didnt he die during the previous eason hence Woodhouse being dead in the elevator?
[3:24:02] <%RioGascar> you can work your ass off to save marines
[3:24:02] <+CyanDeadEye> They can't reload checkpoint
[3:24:07] <misterurbanthelegend> Archer1 Jump Street!
[3:24:07] <UltraBulldozer> I like FX shows for like the first 3 seasons but...
[3:24:11] <%Gruhunchously> But do they REALLY make it though? Really?
[3:24:12] <dinnydanny777> I can't believe you got her killed
[3:24:13] <+mans51> Idk, hard to save some of them from themselves
[3:24:13] <+CyanDeadEye> The checkpoint hit as soon as she went down
[3:24:15] <%doomerskeletor13> Does the Lana NPC have a name?
[3:24:20] <+RustledJimmy> yes, all marines can be saved on reach
[3:24:22] <%LiquidDinosaur> Archer is just like, doing spinoff seasons to sidestep the shark
[3:24:23] <%Halospaz117> Also, technically, not marines in this game (for the most part), army soldiers
[3:24:23] <Solidnick18> good old sprint
[3:24:25] <%LiquidDinosaur> but they're right at the shark
[3:24:25] <%jorniev> give her a good gun
[3:24:26] <%The_Swedish_X> "Play smart" doesn't mean much when the AI will throw themselves into danger
[3:24:26] <%BurdRightsActivist> @doomerskeletor13 All of them do
[3:24:28] <%brave_sj> Every Marine can live, it's your failure that causes their deaths
[3:24:30] <%LiquidDinosaur> one step forward will jump the shark
[3:24:33] <%RioGascar> its probably the name of the VA
[3:24:33] <FiendishlyInventive> Woolie should watch DARK instead.
[3:24:33] <LoganPayne> SUPPRESSING FIREEEEE
[3:24:37] <dinnydanny777> Remember Lana
[3:24:42] <%jorniev> f
[3:24:43] <%Williamld> Mawp
[3:24:44] <%brachydios777> @liquiddinosaur It‚Äôs gone out of the coma
[3:24:45] <%Josef_Stryker> I mean, next season Archer is out of the coma
[3:24:47] <%LiquidDinosaur> It stayed good for a long time
[3:24:47] <@Moobot> Easy with the emojis @SirHypeTheDank
[3:24:48] <%subjectg> I wonder if they‚Äôll get THAT random encounter here
[3:24:49] <ghoulishcripple> @liquiddinosaur I think it was sometime in between I dont remember. all I know is the whole season is like a tribute in retrospect and should have been the END
[3:24:57] <%doomerskeletor13> That‚Äôs how you get ants
[3:24:59] <Dementedpenguin> Remember the space episode of Family Matters? Kappa
[3:25:01] <$whiskeybuisness> krieger-san!
[3:25:02] <biomegabear> American miku
[3:25:03] <%LiquidDinosaur> Look, any show that goes on long enough will become bad, Archer had a really good run
[3:25:03] <%BurdRightsActivist> NO NOT THE DMV
[3:25:05] <+Tacotouchdown> Archer is funny but the season after Vice i fell off
[3:25:05] <bleugh> nyannDab

[3:26:16] <%RioGascar> you already know reach is done for
[3:26:19] <Solidnick18> they changed big time
[3:26:19] <%doomerskeletor13> It takes quite awhile to glass an entire planet
[3:26:21] <%RioGascar> now you get to see it
[3:26:28] <ralphfromdk> DatAsuna Nah, Taris just got bombed to all fuck. This is actual glassing with giant lasers
[3:26:29] <ZeroCruz> Arby doing BIG NUMBERS
[3:26:29] <%LiquidDinosaur> they dont glass "the entire planet"
[3:26:30] <biomegabear> what does wools stand do?
[3:26:30] <%Josef_Stryker> @LiquidDinosaur I mean they clearly lost Reach. All they can do now is run. This game is basically Rogue One.
[3:26:32] <%LiquidDinosaur> just enough
[3:26:45] <+mans51> holy shit that brute is double dead
[3:26:45] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Josef_Stryker I want some people with no heads then
[3:26:47] <Dementedpenguin> That guy FLEW.
[3:26:49] <+Tacotouchdown> Don't worry reach will be fine. Its the people who are fucked!
[3:26:50] <DarkestDawn64> Don't forget altitude lock
[3:26:59] <%threeheadedwalrus> does this have no fall damage like star wars?
[3:26:59] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Josef_Stryker i want Decraniated people in Halo
[3:27:00] <Reizie_Etherealm> Reminder that the calvalry is almost 2 days away from arriving
[3:27:02] <%Goraka91> @LiquidDinosaur I mean 80% or however much is still like, yeah
[3:27:03] <dinnydanny777> Bring me the Horizon, a band who piss and vomit on their fans at concerts :)
[3:27:12] <%doomerskeletor13> Decraniated freak me out
[3:27:14] <+JingKaisean> "glass him"
[3:27:15] <misterurbanthelegend> (Glass him.)
[3:27:16] <+CyanDeadEye> Just Random
[3:27:19] <Divryne> Random.
[3:27:20] <ChernoMuncho> @Tacotouchdown that a george carlin ref?
[3:27:21] <FiendishlyInventive> What about the Nightclub?
[3:27:23] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @liquiddinosaur nah, if they're set to "glass a planet", they do the whole thing. even oceans. it's over the span of a couple days/weeks depending on the size of the planet
[3:27:33] <%LiquidDinosaur> @doomerskeletor13 i forgot everything in Rogue One i was reminded of the idea in Dr Aphra which everyone should read
[3:27:34] <DatAsuna> @ralphfromdk that star destroyer was doing many giant lasers
[3:27:34] <+Tacotouchdown> @chernomuncho yeah
[3:27:35] <%jorniev> WATCH SAUL GOODMAN
[3:27:43] <+RustledJimmy> time to go to the club
[3:27:47] <ChernoMuncho> @Tacotouchdown nice lol

[3:27:58] <%brachydios777> Go clubbing
[3:28:02] <%Goraka91> Clubbed to Death you say?
[3:28:02] <%raven_frame> This part has a great easter egg.
[3:28:07] <%BurdRightsActivist> @friendlyrogue Hospital, Nightclub and Ivory tower are always there. Little objectives inbetween are random
[3:28:08] <%doomerskeletor13> @jorniev Season 6 won‚Äôt start filming till 2021 brownFEELS
[3:28:12] <%LiquidDinosaur> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug oh, but they didnt finish glassing Reach right? or did they stop glassing reach when they chased the PoA?
[3:28:18] <LoganPayne> Even Woolie was shocked he missed that
[3:28:18] <FiendishlyInventive> DARK > Every other Netflix show, and most shows honestly.
[3:28:23] <+Cerebralcloud92> Grayed out = Below
[3:28:24] <$serpenttucker> Hope we get THAT side objective
[3:28:26] <Joestar1890> No Mythic Easter egg then??
[3:28:30] <+Cerebralcloud92> Up Arrow = Above
[3:28:31] <pochecito> Woolie, you can't fight everything in this mission LUL
[3:28:34] <%The_Swedish_X> I hope we explain the easter egg
[3:28:35] <Joestar1890> Sorry, meant for one question mark
[3:28:36] <%brachydios777> @liquiddinosaur They are in the process

[3:29:03] <%subjectg> @liquiddinosaur they‚Äôre still doing that, it‚Äôs just we‚Äôre on another part of the planet
[3:29:04] <Reizie_Etherealm> "Do you wanna do the easter egg?" "haha challenge completed"
[3:29:09] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @liquiddinosaur probably the latter. there's glassing a planet where you just fire a beam on every square inch or close enough and then there's glassing a planet where it becomes completely uninhabitable forever
[3:29:14] <fault_417> The club really fits the covenants aesthetics doesn‚Äôt it
[3:29:21] <%brachydios777> Reach is much bigger than Earth

[3:29:47] <CrimsonGargoyle> yeah chat, but what's the difference between spartan 3 and spartan 4 Kappa
[3:29:47] <%Halospaz117> Didn't they add the sabre to Reach forge?
[3:29:48] <%Goraka91> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug All I know is they did start recolonizing Reach after the war, so it can't have been total
[3:29:53] <Minerslovegames> Time to dance.
[3:29:54] <%condemned_15> there was a helipad
[3:29:55] <Onatamana> Saber is a new addition to Reach forge mode, isn't it?

[3:32:11] <jaygee303> @liquiddinosaur You press a button on the map and the brutes are DJ-ing to a halo remix with dancing Grunts
[3:32:13] <SSBBfan666> @bricklordly how so?
[3:32:15] <$serpenttucker> Hunters really should be more bullshit
[3:32:15] <Torivore> Why Woolie keep activating ugly vision?
[3:32:19] <+Byronic_dreamer> Woolie still fighting hunters head on 4 games in Kappa
[3:32:22] <%doomerskeletor13> I love how the Social Network made Mark seem like a charismatic smart guy who has all the answers and in real life he‚Äôs the most awkward nerd who can barely string a coherent sentence together
[3:32:23] <$serpenttucker> I wish we got halo wars 2 hunters.
[3:32:37] <%Andrizzleton> hunters are fullfights

[3:33:48] <saddlezilla1> @anita_dickin they are. we even got our first named hunter character in HW2 as a hero unit.
[3:33:48] <RayMan799> Woolie STILL doesnt know how to kill a hunter lol
[3:33:49] <%brachydios777> @liquiddinosaur I think it‚Äôs because of the model change

[3:34:21] <Dementedpenguin> They didn't like the music.
[3:34:22] <%doomerskeletor13> They wanted to go clubbing
[3:34:23] <KapitanOrient> Halo what?
[3:34:24] <%threeheadedwalrus> these marines are super lucky and totally survive
[3:34:26] <herzogtheanimal> What a shame.
[3:34:31] <herzogtheanimal> They were good men.
[3:34:32] <%The_Swedish_X> They were sentries
[3:34:32] <Torivore> Halo Wars can have like 60 at once
[3:34:34] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Theres no Halo 5
[3:34:35] <phantalime> 4 hunters can happen in halo 5 in oevel 2 if you fuck up
[3:34:36] <herzogtheanimal> What a rotten way to die.
[3:34:39] <jaygee303> Halo redacted
[3:34:46] <DatAsuna> They're defending the jammer
[3:34:46] <%LiquidDinosaur> @threeheadedwalrus maybe they can go into the walk in freezer to be safe from the glassing
[3:34:52] <Onatamana> We KNOW the Covenant is willing to throw the lives of their soldiers into the grinder
[3:34:53] <%doomerskeletor13> Kinda weird that they went right from Halo 4 to Halo 6
[3:34:55] <%brachydios777> I mean they have phantoms going around

[3:38:26] <+slimmixrp> Just the little side ones are random
[3:38:32] <dinnydanny777> Buck's theme makes him seem like a badass
[3:38:33] <+D00msDayDan> if he was looking for never surrender he's already missed it

[3:40:17] <Solidnick18> you be soft
[3:40:18] <%DarkestVegemite> GAMES AS A SERVICE
[3:40:21] <$serpenttucker> Here's hoping valhalla isn't grindy bullshit like odyssey
[3:40:24] <herzogtheanimal> Starving children in africa could have eaten that game V
[3:40:26] <%Irridium> shoutout to everyone who says the store isn't intrusive.
[3:40:28] <thebalticguy1> DATAPAD?
[3:40:28] <DatAsuna> ALso origins was when they swapped to the shitty destiny UI
[3:40:30] <%CoreyOfMyLife> Services as a Game
[3:40:33] <Solidnick18> The game is the store
[3:40:35] <bricklordly> but then you wasted eighty dollars, V...

[3:40:37] <%condemned_15> datapad
[3:40:40] <%subjectg> @onatamana that‚Äôs what they said about spartan ops, so i‚Äôm kinda worried
[3:40:41] <Ion_Laser> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug But now they want more tho for the "just cosmetics" Kappa
[3:40:41] <+Neoripo> They totally do
[3:40:43] <$whiskeybuisness> use the vbucks!
[3:40:50] <+IntrepidEye> Gotta have those xp boosts in a goddamn single player game rooSuffer
[3:41:01] <%threeheadedwalrus> jesus christ these turret marines are going ham
[3:41:01] <+Tacotouchdown> you can fit the falcon in here or another building
[3:41:04] <Explodincatz> same
[3:41:04] <dinnydanny777> Immersion is broken if you're trying to charge me ¬£20 at the start screen ngl
[3:41:12] <xxshadowxx416> assiassin freed after 3 and may unite is the worst
[3:41:14] <+RustledJimmy> but the kids love spending, they make the purchase so pretty and sound good
[3:41:16] <%brachydios777> Req packs are the worst
[3:41:19] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @ion_laser yeah but v should have just finished the game he paid for instead of quitting on principle
[3:41:19] <%brave_sj> Those guys will be fine
[3:41:23] <Nomad94> I forgot
[3:41:26] <Dragonborn983> Steal the banshee, break the wings.
[3:41:26] <%brave_sj> I dunno lol
[3:41:27] <$usotaku013666> Paul Marketing is an asshole!
[3:41:27] <%Gruhunchously> We created more meaningless grind in our game, but if you pay more we'll let you bypass it.
[3:41:29] <sonofthedeepsouth> The UNSC did nothing wrong. The rebels deserved it.
[3:41:30] <Overloard> putting infinity mirrors on helipads is actually a pretty dope idea
[3:41:43] <%doomerskeletor13> @sonofthedeepsouth X to doubt
[3:41:49] <%ChoculaUltra> its not just kids doing the mtx is the sad part. There's stories of dudes spending $16k trying to get fucking Cloud in a FF gacha game lmao
[3:41:49] <%superc37> its back and club errera at the roof with the button /lenny face
[3:41:53] <+Tacotouchdown> assassin creed peaked at brother hood then 4 then down hill sonce
[3:41:55] <+mans51> man that thing is really hanging by a thread
[3:41:59] <%BisoromiBear> Woolie is putting the planet on his back
[3:41:59] <%ScreamLord> "NeXt GeN gAmEs NeEd tO bE $70 tOo CoVeR tHe cOsTs oF dEvElOpMeNt!" Fuck off
[3:42:01] <%RioGascar> "As soon as you get into the chopper, turn northwest toward the large, double-pointed building in the distance. Just past that building is a shorter triangular-roofed building. On the opposite side of the rooftop you'll find the data pad. "
[3:42:03] <Reizie_Etherealm> Meanwhile Sucker Punch with Ghost of Tsushima says fuck you to money and is just giving us stuff
[3:42:04] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> Buy the ‚ÄúPay Our Managers‚Äô Legal Fees‚Äù package for double XP!
[3:42:13] <sonofthedeepsouth> Assassins Creed brotherhood was so good
[3:42:14] <+Neoripo> Odyssey is the worst AC by not being an AC game at all. Also the combat is utter garbage
[3:42:23] <%threeheadedwalrus> PSP, I have a family to feed
[3:42:31] <RamenRiderZ> I got Cloud randomly and Ive uninstalled the game years ago lol
[3:42:33] <+IntrepidEye> @Gruhunchously And we'll try to ban people who use XP exploits to avoid paying
[3:42:34] <+sunsetserenity1> I just wish Ubisoft improved on the changes they made with unity and kept co-op
[3:42:35] <sonofthedeepsouth> assassins creed mp was fun
[3:42:36] <+KiwiRedgrave> I'm pretty glad i never played AC because i would be so dissapointed to see what it is now
[3:42:38] <%ScreamLord> Black Flag was the last good Assassin's Creed
[3:42:39] <%The_Swedish_X> Near a large slopped skyscraper
[3:42:42] <$whiskeybuisness> buy the double xp bonus to make our devs have to go through worse crunch!
[3:42:45] <+Tacotouchdown> they don't need to chill on texture detail that's what make games take so long
[3:42:50] <%BurdRightsActivist> @Neoripo You're the worst human by not being a human at all.
[3:42:50] <Overloard> lookit dat infinity mirror tho
[3:42:53] <+kawachipto> ghost of tsushima is the best AC game
[3:42:58] <Reizie_Etherealm> I think Rogue is still pretty alright
[3:43:00] <%condemned_15> If it really matters, you can just read it on a wiki on your off time
[3:43:00] <+Neoripo> true
[3:43:01] <+Tacotouchdown> Black Flag best game
[3:43:01] <%BurdRightsActivist> Kappa
[3:43:01] <%Irridium> tfw Assassin's Creed was your favorite franchise of last-gen woolieDATTEBAYO
[3:43:09] <$emptyantics> Black flag is best AC
[3:43:11] <%Gruhunchously> Ghost of Tsushima makes Assassin's Creed obsolete
[3:43:11] <Nomad94> @kawachipto Ghost of Tsushima was the Feudal Japan AC I always wanted
[3:43:12] <%doomerskeletor13> Ghost of Tsushima is Assassins Creed but good
[3:43:16] <bricklordly> I mean, if V got. refund, then thats fine. but if you just waist the money and then go "WAA STOP ASKING FOR MORE MONEY" and don't use the product you paid for, what the fuck?
[3:43:17] <danielmorn> isnt it in this building? might be misrememberin
[3:43:19] <turf_wind_and_fire> V and Woolie, is it weird that there's brutes and other tech that's brand new that hadn't been seen in the previous games canonically?
[3:43:22] <FiendishlyInventive> lol Assassin's Creed
[3:43:23] <Mothman742> @ScreamLord ah i see u too have good taste
[3:43:24] <%ChoculaUltra> ngl, Anthem and FO76 really set the bar low for a game warranting mtx. They told they world you can sell a broken game for $60 bucks and have in-game shop as shamelessly as possible.
[3:43:41] <dinnydanny777> Sucker Punch seem like a wholesome developer
[3:43:48] <RamenRiderZ> Ubisoft are forever coward bitches for not making Japan AC
[3:43:49] <sonofthedeepsouth> Ass Creed- Cult of the Taint
[3:43:53] <sonofthedeepsouth> yeah
[3:43:55] <%threeheadedwalrus> @ChoculaUltra but they're both massive failures
[3:43:56] <Overloard> GOAT of sushi-mama is like ass creed but with characters i care about
[3:43:56] <+aWanderingKaivo> rotating in game shop at that for that FOMO
[3:44:03] <+Tacotouchdown> assassin creed: ghost of Tsushima
[3:44:03] <+Neoripo> AC wishes to have a combat system that works
[3:44:06] <Nomad94> remember when people actually complained about Ghost of Tsushima depicting Japan because the devs aren't asian? LUL
[3:44:09] <FiendishlyInventive> Turn the VISR off.
[3:44:12] <%subjectg> @ramenriderz That and the WW2 AC we‚Äôre never getting
[3:44:15] <%yhom_tork> KKona
[3:44:17] <LoganPayne> Elevator music!
[3:44:17] <%ChoculaUltra> @threeheadedwalrus tell that to the people dropping $10 dollars for blue power armor in FO76
[3:44:17] <OverlordLuna> SourPls
[3:44:18] <%The_Swedish_X> elevator music too
[3:44:21] <%brachydios777> @turf_wind_and_fire They were always there, it‚Äôs just they didn‚Äôt appear in the games previous to them
[3:44:25] <$serpenttucker> @turf_wind_and_fire you could argue that both humans and covies saw a lot of this tech here as being purely prototypes, too expensive, lost to reach, or just inferior
[3:44:26] <Zohare> I feel like Woolie dies in this room
[3:44:27] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @choculaultra fo76 was the most egregious with a full 60$ game also requiring a 100/year golden sub for things like private servers
[3:44:28] <%BisoromiBear> Garth who?
[3:44:29] <%The_Swedish_X> find the marine
[3:44:30] <+mans51> for space truckers

[3:44:41] <+kawachipto> lol halo 2 map
[3:44:41] <%RioGascar> that music is apparently from marty o'donells experince doing TV ads
[3:44:41] <%threeheadedwalrus> @ChoculaUltra lmao that's pretty sad
[3:44:42] <+Wildorox> where does Halo Reach take place in the timeline of main games? Not too familiar with it at all really
[3:44:42] <%The_Swedish_X> Woolie will hate him

[3:44:55] <Reizie_Etherealm> Woolie won't find him
[3:44:56] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @wildorox it takes place right before Halo 1
[3:44:56] <+Haildrops> ah he missed the marine
[3:44:57] <%doomerskeletor13> @wildorox Right before Combat Evolved
[3:44:57] <+CyanDeadEye> RUN
[3:44:57] <%subjectg> Hey look, a Halo 2 map
[3:44:57] <dinnydanny777> Imagine getting in an elevator in a burning city, Spartans clearly never read the elevator safety rules
[3:44:58] <Xenthinel> I lliked the old games, but got burned out with revelations. So I like the new AC games.
[3:45:02] <%superc37> oh yeah isnt this the map with the suicidal marine easter egg?
[3:45:04] <%ScreamLord> Space Country in a mostly Hungarian Colony
[3:45:05] <%raven_frame> They missed the guy, all well.
[3:45:05] <DigitalJoshie> RUN
[3:45:06] <Nomad94> @Overloard Kotaku jumped on that bandwagon? lol
[3:45:09] <SpaceGuntank> BUGS
[3:45:09] <+Wildorox> oh its the prequel game...thanks chat!
[3:45:10] <$whiskeybuisness> this mp map was pretty fun
[3:45:10] <%brachydios777> @wildorox Months before Halo 1
[3:45:11] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> Is this the ODST level?
[3:45:13] <Sullry> i mean the mantis was made before the human covenant war it just didn't show up till halo 4
[3:45:14] <+smacksfenton> hey chat I'm an anime watcher just stopping by, does Woolie like Reach? thanks bbs
[3:45:16] <raikagelord1> Love the set design for this level.
[3:45:20] <dinnydanny777> This music is great
[3:45:21] <%The_Swedish_X> There is a shell shocked marine here
[3:45:23] <%BurdRightsActivist> woolie gonna lose the jet pack 4Head
[3:45:23] <Onatamana> Isn't it so nice that the covenant added a convenient self destruct button to their Incredibly Important Thing?
[3:45:24] <Overloard> @Nomad94 they started iirc
[3:45:26] <%Estuko> @smacksfenton enjoying it
[3:45:28] <+QueequegTheater> @smacksfenton yes
[3:45:28] <+RustledJimmy> I'd like to think that the elites in neo-africa discovered country music and fell in love
[3:45:29] <turf_wind_and_fire> @brachydios777 @serpenttucker I hadn't actually thought of it that way. It always was like a hangnail to me. It didn't ruin my excitement, but it was kinda weird.
[3:45:29] <Nomad94> oof
[3:45:31] <bricklordly> no he HATES it
[3:45:32] <%doomerskeletor13> @smacksfenton He is enjoying it
[3:45:33] <sonofthedeepsouth> oof
[3:45:33] <%Gruhunchously> If it's a choice between jetpack and something other than a jetpack...there is not choice.
[3:45:34] <%ChoculaUltra> FO76 should've been a free update to FO4 if we're being completely honest
[3:45:40] <DigitalJoshie> rip jetpack
[3:45:43] <sonofthedeepsouth> Woolie loves getting shot

[3:46:30] <+Tacotouchdown> the only downside to F076 is that its a interesting and there biggest map stuck in a busted game
[3:46:31] <$serpenttucker> @turf_wind_and_fire I mean, don't get me wrong, it still feels weird. That said, I could see why some of the guns would not make a return. The rest of it is probably just due to oversight or handwaving
[3:46:32] <+smacksfenton> @Tacotouchdown I legit thought he might! Its way more MILITARY MEN DOING ARMY THINGS than the others, which is what put him off halo before he tried it if I recall correctly lol

[4:00:04] <%doomerskeletor13> Gotta get that grind
[4:00:11] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @turbofolk
[4:00:12] <%Halospaz117> Assault was good dangit
[4:00:12] <dinnydanny777> Star Fox Assault's story is messed up
[4:00:13] <+Pyroclase> GREAT soundtrack
[4:00:18] <%Ancopro> not bad
[4:00:19] <Overloard> woolie get BIG spartan numbers UP like pat
[4:00:25] <%Halospaz117> Also, best version of the Star Wolf thing
[4:00:26] <dinnydanny777> Star Fox Assault's story is shockingly depressing and dark
[4:00:29] <+Lunaar> Star Fox: Assault - better than expected, worse than it should have been
[4:00:32] <SixthSun2> Yes, Namco
[4:00:34] <dinnydanny777> It's bleak as fuck
[4:00:35] <DatAsuna> I remember that one had a death star run
[4:00:40] <%Javaa01> Yeah, that's the one that got outsourced
[4:00:41] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:00:43] <%Halospaz117> I am one of the love people
[4:00:45] <misterurbanthelegend> Cover that helmet in techno crap even if you don't know what they do!
[4:00:45] <+A0N33> Yeah I ain't gonna fault anyone on not finishing Command.
[4:01:02] <DatAsuna> IDK, if people were upset about assault they must have hated adventure
[4:01:02] <DigitalJoshie> starfox assault LP? PogChamp
[4:01:08] <dinnydanny777> Star Fox Assault has body horror
[4:01:08] <GenkoForrest> star fox Assault is what the series should have evolved in to. the on rails shooter is so tired now.
[4:01:13] <+jahansoundsystem> I remember playing assault, forgetting it was called assault, and when I wanted to go get it, I got adventures instead
[4:01:18] <DatAsuna> considering the balance in adventure lol
[4:01:30] <SixthSun2> @jahansoundsystem that's a big oof
[4:01:34] <%brachydios777> LUL
[4:01:43] <+KiwiRedgrave> Also a Pretty cool web series
[4:01:44] <Divryne> LUL
[4:01:45] <+jahansoundsystem> I did eventually get assault
[4:01:46] <+jiggy_snipe> yea it was the highlight of the series
[4:01:51] <%derap41> Batman Fought everythign
[4:01:52] <%condemned_15> predator
[4:01:53] <+KiwiRedgrave> Batman fought em all
[4:01:54] <Kotyc_> scooby doo
[4:02:02] <+Mahbonk> Batman wrestles the world
[4:02:03] <%dekkitout> Batman fought Batman
[4:02:06] <%derap41> Make them fight
[4:02:07] <Nomad94> But when will Batman fight his childhoood trauma
[4:02:09] <majindusto> Batman fought THE DARKNESS!!!!
[4:02:11] <%Ancopro> in star fox assualt you can jump on top of your arwing and fire your weapons thats rad
[4:02:12] <+Zyquux> Yeah but how many if them did Batman fuck?
[4:02:16] <+JingKaisean> can we get some clarification on whether or not spartan armor jerks you off?
[4:02:16] <%eyezehuhh> But did Batman ever fight the wage gap Kappa
[4:02:19] <dinnydanny777> Didn't Archie fight Batman
[4:02:20] <%brachydios777> Batman fought the predator
[4:02:21] <%dekkitout> @majindusto He literally has tho
[4:02:25] <%jorniev> Batman fought THE APOCALYPSE
[4:02:26] <ChernoMuncho> batman is dumb
[4:02:27] <Nomad94> @eyezehuhh he can't fight what doesn't exist LUL
[4:02:39] <%eyezehuhh> @Nomad94 smart man
[4:02:41] <dinnydanny777> Weren't there a bunch of comics with Archie, from Archie comics fighting superheroes
[4:02:46] <misterurbanthelegend> Fuck disney.
[4:02:49] <dinnydanny777> Including the Predator
[4:02:55] <%jorniev> ARCHIE VS PREDATOR
[4:02:58] <%derap41> They're deep into it
[4:03:03] <%dekkitout> Dark Knights/DC Metal is the dumbest radest Batman Batmaning it up
[4:03:10] <+mans51> AngelThump
[4:03:13] <majindusto> @dekkitout I meant the Comic character
[4:03:30] <%dekkitout> I meant a literal Dark Multiverse god LUL
[4:03:32] <%derap41> Paid shills
[4:03:41] <+Haildrops> where are they reading these from
[4:03:48] <+QueequegTheater> ETHAN
[4:03:54] <+Rookie_Balboa> yeah thats the video LMAO
[4:03:56] <+QueequegTheater> YOU HAVE TO IMPREGNATE CLAAAAIIIRREE
[4:04:07] <dinnydanny777> I thought Nintendo Hire this Man would be to the Tune of Karma Police by Radiohead and I was shocked when it was not
[4:04:29] <+QueequegTheater> But a dog beat me over the fence
[4:04:38] <+Rookie_Balboa> rare dialogue
[4:04:40] <Nomad94> It's a skull that makes rare voice lines common
[4:04:40] <DemonicHoward> it makes the humans say dumb shit
[4:04:41] <misterurbanthelegend> Ethan impregnating Jill for the bloodline.
[4:04:42] <WolfemanMaverik> But a dog beat me over the fence
[4:04:44] <%Irridium> it's in outskirts on top of the buildings
[4:04:45] <SpaceGuntank> it gives more unique dialouge
[4:04:48] <%Halospaz117> Increases the rarea nd funny dialogue
[4:04:48] <$serpenttucker> Am I the only one who remembers the dessicated dog head in zanibar on OG halo 2 if you have your xbox set to a certain date?
[4:04:49] <%Ancopro> it increases the chance for goofy lines
[4:04:50] <%RioGascar> the i would have been your daddy skull is a hard ass skull to get
[4:04:52] <%Irridium> got to pass like 7 checkpoints in a certain order
[4:04:54] <dinnydanny777> Remember Lana?
[4:05:04] <%dekkitout> Little glassy in some spots
[4:05:05] <Nomad94> @Irridium that's the Halo 3 skull.
[4:05:07] <$serpenttucker> *zanzibar
[4:05:09] <%brachydios777> Rare dialogue is used more often
[4:05:11] <+Zyquux> IWHBYD is named after a Johnson line if I remember correctly
[4:05:19] <%Irridium> @Nomad94 no for Halo 3 you had to jump through the rings
[4:05:30] <DigitalJoshie> reach has a really great presentation
[4:05:31] <DatAsuna> the engine bump helps it hold up better
[4:05:38] <Zohare> There a lot of ass shots in Reach
[4:05:39] <Nomad94> @Irridium yes, that's what I said. the halo 2 skull is hidden differently.
[4:05:40] <%BisoromiBear> defend your hometown
[4:05:40] <%MaddyCaddy> :(
[4:05:43] <misterurbanthelegend> Ethan impregnating Claire for the bloodline.
[4:05:47] <%brachydios777> Reach‚Äôs engine is pretty good
[4:05:48] <+JingKaisean> Are you glad that Apone finally got justice in the form of Johnson?
[4:05:50] <ChernoMuncho> augmented ass
[4:05:52] <+Zyquux> @irridium That skull is some BS without looking it up
[4:05:56] <DigitalJoshie> you know what, all the Spartans in reach got a great booty
[4:05:57] <Captain_Ragtag> I liked Reach a lot and get a lot of flak from it. I like it because it's not just another Chief story and shows more spartans in action and expands the ingame universe
[4:05:58] <$serpenttucker> I mean...ehhh
[4:05:59] <+QueequegTheater> Because H1A ruined the atmosphere
[4:06:01] <%RioGascar> an odd thing with bungie is they commented on those butt shots
[4:06:08] <DatAsuna> That one does at least
[4:06:28] <idiotscampaign> i've called it that
[4:06:29] <Nomad94> chat?
[4:06:31] <%Halospaz117> Yeah people say CEA
[4:06:40] <%brachydios777> It‚Äôs literally what it‚Äôs called
[4:06:53] <Shade075> LUL
[4:06:54] <+QueequegTheater> The Jodie is a stand user

[4:07:19] <%jorniev> OLD MAN DETECTIVE
[4:07:19] <$emptyantics> What was the question?
[4:07:22] <+QueequegTheater> MARCUS LAFAYETTE
[4:07:23] <%dekkitout> Magic black guy is Marcus, right
[4:07:24] <%brachydios777> Gotta defeat the fat evil
[4:07:25] <+QueequegTheater> REMEMBER
[4:07:28] <DatAsuna> Imagine being in a quantic dream audition room and cage just stops you mid-read and goes "Perfect, you truly have the face of a rapist"
[4:07:32] <%jorniev> VICTIM WOMAN
[4:07:40] <misterurbanthelegend> Not playin' that game.

[4:07:51] <dinnydanny777> Fat Evil
[4:08:19] <$serpenttucker> I'm more used to always aiming for headshots with elites then with grunts, so I gotta adjust LOWER to deal with grunts
[4:08:27] <+Zyquux> LUL
[4:08:43] <%RioGascar> wouldnt it explode on a timer?
[4:08:47] <omnishadeee> dishonored?

[4:08:55] <DatAsuna> yeah it does Rio
[4:09:00] <%RioGascar> nice
[4:09:10] <DatAsuna> it's not a blanaced custom but it is fun
[4:09:10] <%jorniev> PSY OPS
[4:09:11] <%brachydios777> Uh oh John
[4:09:13] <+JingKaisean> After MCC PC finishes, will you do Halo 5?
[4:09:25] <%RioGascar> you miss out on halo 2's AWESOME menu
[4:09:27] <+duskrush> Rocket baseball is a thing in Halo 3 and Reach with the Gravity Hammer
[4:09:28] <%RioGascar> and menu music
[4:09:31] <pixel_river> true
[4:09:42] <DigitalJoshie> halo 3's main menu theme makes my hair dtand up
[4:09:44] <%VCRUZZO> yeah they were awesome
[4:09:44] <DatAsuna> Prime 2's menu is <3
[4:09:45] <AMUSERNAME> Halo 2's awesome END CREDITS got cut in the MCC too
[4:09:46] <+Haildrops> i wouldn't call grifball baseball
[4:09:54] <%RioGascar> 8 actually
[4:09:56] <%Halospaz117> Yeah, the loss of the menus and loading screens is my biggest gripe with MCC honestly
[4:10:07] <+Tacotouchdown> halo wars
[4:10:10] <%ChoculaUltra> LUL
[4:10:20] <Clear_Truth> @WoolieVersus Will you be playing Halo Wars?
[4:10:24] <+Tacotouchdown> than Spartan assault
[4:10:26] <%Irridium> man Halo 3's loading screens were stylish as fuck
[4:10:29] <prime_name> Indeed
[4:10:29] <Afterman_> fair
[4:10:29] <%ChoculaUltra> Kisame's death was rad af tho
[4:10:30] <+Rookie_Balboa> Correct
[4:10:31] <KnivesEve> who?
[4:10:33] <+Tacotouchdown> then Spartan ops
[4:10:39] <%VCRUZZO> duh
[4:10:39] <coreyyotto> Kisame had way more tech though
[4:10:39] <Djinnazz> @Clear_Truth He won't tell you.
[4:10:43] <%BisoromiBear> kisamebros, we're leaving
[4:10:43] <DatAsuna> Man when's Prime trilogy on switch?
[4:10:50] <misterurbanthelegend> Woolie's favorite D&D class is the short haired girl.
[4:10:50] <%brachydios777> LUL
[4:10:55] <+liquidzr0> huh
[4:10:57] <dinnydanny777> Nah, Emile didn't get any character development yet
[4:10:57] <Afterman_> @BisoromiBear true. hes my favorite character T_T
[4:10:59] <+liquidzr0> ????
[4:10:59] <majindusto> THE MUSIC enigmaGasm
[4:11:01] <%ChoculaUltra> We're taking our scaly swords and LEAVING. Don't talk to me or my Shark son ever again.
[4:11:03] <DatAsuna> Why would it hit more?
[4:11:04] <%Halospaz117> Emily
[4:11:05] <%jorniev> sabuza lost to dogs
[4:11:06] <dinnydanny777> Emile needed more character development
[4:11:06] <+Haildrops> We can get past it sir.
[4:11:15] <+JingKaisean> Emile was... kinda nothing
[4:11:19] <+Haildrops> My favourite thing about Emile is that his outward personality seems psychopathic and sadistic but his psych eval shows that he basically only acts that way because he knows it demoralizes the enemy.
[4:11:32] <%ChoculaUltra> Emile was just there to sell those Play Arts Kai toys lmao
[4:11:33] <DatAsuna> Kat and jorge have the most screentime by far
[4:11:33] <%jorniev> Emile is cool
[4:11:41] <+Zyquux> The deaths are all ironic. Big guy dies in a big explosion. Smart one dies to a headshot.
[4:11:42] <coreyyotto> But then Zabuza was also able to kill the 2nd Mizukage iirc
[4:11:54] <+JingKaisean> lol right? why not a fuckin fuel rod shot?
[4:11:56] <dinnydanny777> Why not just bomb them with the ship?
[4:11:58] <pochecito> And it had to be a fucking jackal
[4:12:01] <%Javaa01> Maybe the jackal was colorblind
[4:12:02] <%alpacasintophats> Suppressive fire is a thing
[4:12:04] <+jiggy_snipe> for maximum pain
[4:12:04] <%Javaa01> And could only see blue
[4:12:06] <+Haildrops> It wasn't a jackal
[4:12:08] <DatAsuna> Because 6 has PLOT ARMOR, it's even better than mjolnir armor
[4:12:11] <+Haildrops> It was an elite zealot
[4:12:14] <%Chatterbox1991> The Covinent was woolieONEGUY
[4:12:15] <+Haildrops> and he had a fucking grudge
[4:12:16] <+Tacotouchdown> I wish Carter got a PAK
[4:12:17] <TigerClaws12> a zealot shot Kat
[4:12:18] <rsg220> noble six returns fire with the magnum, time to bail out elites the balls on this human
[4:12:23] <%CappuccinoGuil> To be fair, Noble Six was firing back. To be EXTRA fair, Six was firing at a SHIP with a PISTOL LUL
[4:12:24] <%VCRUZZO> nah one is enough
[4:12:26] <%Ancopro> suppressive fire with one bullet
[4:12:26] <%alpacasintophats> Suppressive fire is very much a thing
[4:12:27] <vulkan_vibes> her shields were extra fucked up.
[4:12:27] <%dekkitout> I bet whoever sniped her has a book
[4:12:33] <+reshiramdude16> I'm pretty sure it's the Zealot that's been dogging Noble Team all game too
[4:12:34] <misterurbanthelegend> Wait for Emiles moment.
[4:12:41] <%DemonOfSalt> Hee! XD
[4:12:42] <Sullry> good ol jfj
[4:12:53] <vulkan_vibes> her shields regened slower than the team because of the arm.
[4:13:04] <+Tacotouchdown> she's has robot arm
[4:13:06] <%VCRUZZO> nice
[4:13:07] <brightdrake99> JFJ FANS WHERE YOU AT
[4:13:14] <%VCRUZZO> oh damn
[4:13:15] <$serpenttucker> I mean, would reach have the same calender as earth?
[4:13:21] <DatAsuna> All ubisoft games copied that shit
[4:13:24] <DatAsuna> and it sucks
[4:13:24] <+Rookie_Balboa> yes
[4:13:26] <%VCRUZZO> yeah
[4:13:27] <+Haildrops> there's a unified UNSC calendar i believe
[4:13:30] <+Rookie_Balboa> its a universal calendar
[4:13:30] <Sullry> its so slow especially the menus
[4:13:34] <%CappuccinoGuil> Y'all can keep coming up with reasons as to why Kat was shot and killed, but at the end it's "show don't tell" folks
[4:13:34] <Ghostbody> agreed Asuna
[4:13:43] <Sullry> it takes like 5 mins to load its awful

[4:15:07] <Torivore> You're playing mp tho
[4:15:07] <%brachydios777> Do It!
[4:15:21] <%RioGascar> huh...also the cinematics director
[4:15:22] <%RioGascar> huh
[4:15:23] <REGNIERx> Contact harvest is the best book hands down
[4:15:25] <%jorniev> YOU GOTTA WORK HARS TO CHEAT GOOD
[4:15:27] <Reizie_Etherealm> Johnson fucks?
[4:15:29] <+mans51> huh.. thought harvest was one of the weaker ones
[4:15:29] <%brachydios777> Aw wait Multiplayer never mind
[4:15:49] <%brachydios777> Reach has very competent writing
[4:15:50] <CrimsonGargoyle> V's hair on f l e e k tho
[4:16:09] <%jorniev> who is the writer for infinite?
[4:16:11] <%VCRUZZO> yeah
[4:16:14] <DatAsuna> They don't even speak english anymore
[4:16:19] <%RioGascar> reach bungie wanted to make the covenant scary again
[4:16:21] <+Tacotouchdown> reach was Bungies magnum opus for halo?
[4:16:25] <%Javaa01> Oh who cares, just live
[4:16:25] <%VCRUZZO> they just keep coming
[4:16:33] <%VCRUZZO> to fuck you
[4:16:34] <%DSD24> Well they didn't speak English yet
[4:16:36] <%RioGascar> halo 2 they explained the covenent more and it made them less scary
[4:16:38] <+Haildrops> Reach elites are by far the best designs
[4:16:41] <%brachydios777> The first time the Covenant actually speak a foreign language
[4:16:49] <dinnydanny777> Reach Elites are actually a threat
[4:16:50] <$serpenttucker> TBF not every story has to follow the same beats or has the same themes
[4:16:56] <%Ancopro> no face? NO CARE
[4:16:57] <SpaceGuntank> it gets stuffy in those helmets yo
[4:17:00] <Reizie_Etherealm> 2 adds so much more to the universe with how the covenant start speaking English
[4:17:10] <%brachydios777> Reach and Halo 2 A Elites are great
[4:17:16] <DatAsuna> I like noble teeam more than most fo the rogue one characters lol
[4:17:22] <Sullry> works better as a game tbh
[4:17:25] <+Tacotouchdown> I cant see chief's face there for i dont care
[4:17:37] <misterurbanthelegend> Reach is still better.
[4:17:41] <dinnydanny777> Reservoir Dogsing it
[4:17:43] <%jorniev> independence day did that
[4:17:48] <Afterman_> "this isnt going to go the way you think it is"
[4:17:52] <%Deft_Thought> I always found it a little weird how much more capable Master Chief is as BIG HERO GODKING in comparison to the Spartan Squad on Reach
[4:18:01] <Torivore> The Covenant spoke english 20 years ago in Wars
[4:18:04] <%RioGascar> an issue you have in this is Reach has been signposted for a decade. but bungie was able to pull it off and show the devistation reach felt
[4:18:05] <%Ancopro> soooo he should play ODST LUL
[4:18:06] <%Goraka91> o/
[4:18:09] <%Deft_Thought> Thanks for stream, y'all

[4:18:28] <Reizie_Etherealm> Master Chief is like Doom guy, he's scripted, he's written to be OP
