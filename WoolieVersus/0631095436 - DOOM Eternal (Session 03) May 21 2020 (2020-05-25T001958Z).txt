[0:00:00] <%Solidnick18> woolieOMG
[0:00:18] <%Solidnick18> nice
[0:00:20] <goodakuma> im fine
[0:00:20] <%HollowedIdjit> Argent Kirby
[0:00:22] <+adimcorner> a bit dissapointed I can't yell Doom at the top of my lungs
[0:00:26] <superelitejimi> @GoldeNOVA what line
[0:00:28] <goodakuma> yes
[0:00:30] <%Solidnick18> i'm good
[0:00:33] <+MrProw> As a Steam Controller shill I have to say it works really great with Doom Eternal
[0:00:38] <%DesertPenguin> Denuvo is being taken out. Just announced today!
[0:00:39] <fist_wizard_jay> Kar en Tuk
[0:00:44] <goodakuma> wut
[0:00:50] <%GelatinBoi> we doomin?
[0:00:57] <RantingRavager> Doomin and vibing
[0:00:58] <fist_wizard_jay> Kar en TOOK that Denuvo shit out
[0:01:01] <ihateyouo> Anti-cheat shit is to be removed
[0:01:04] <%GoldeNOVA> @superelitejimi the one on the right of the emote woolieTRASH
[0:01:11] <+Yamchadassist> atpSuspect
[0:01:29] <%DesertPenguin> God damnit Bethesda fix your fucking twitch prime skin!!!!!!
[0:01:35] <akman14> That's the point
[0:01:35] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1262613184097255426
[0:01:43] <%Solidnick18> it's towards the end
[0:01:48] <goodakuma> feels badman
[0:01:52] <%Solidnick18> yep
[0:02:02] <%DesertPenguin> Because it would break the game with loading things in the wrong order
[0:02:10] <%Josef_Stryker> That's the point. It's basically a "Ok time to see what I missed" button
[0:02:12] <%DesertPenguin> But you can use cheats to make it easier
[0:02:27] <superelitejimi> aw fuck i'm behind on the manga, i missed first doom...
[0:02:31] <superelitejimi> bye all
[0:02:32] <%DesertPenguin> "Oh no, the game wants me to play more of it"
[0:02:34] <vVAstrAVv> Woolie the point of fast travel is level cleanup after the mission. why would they let you start the mission over and sequence break it
[0:02:36] <%Shishi1205> @WoolieVersus You can use the cheats to make it trivially easy to reach the point you want
[0:02:40] <goodakuma> Doom 2016, how long ago was that
[0:02:44] <%DesertPenguin> Use the cheats
[0:02:58] <joshua_42> A couple months ago for Woolie
[0:02:58] <%GeneralSCPatton> CLEANUP IS WHY FAST TRAVEL EXISTS
[0:03:00] <%DesertPenguin> yea that's a good one
[0:03:03] <%DesertPenguin> infinite ammo
[0:03:05] <ihateyouo> infinite ammo
[0:03:14] <%FuqBoiSlim> COOM Internal
[0:03:17] <+Yamchadassist> Infinite ammo brekas everything
[0:03:18] <FrostedZaibatsu> yt mode cheat hggLul
[0:03:18] <%Lightwolfe> Lightwolfe is gifting 5 Tier 1 Subs to WoolieVersus's community! They've gifted a total of 5 in the channel!

[0:03:20] <%Lightwolfe> Lightwolfe gifted a Tier 1 sub to faronmcsalty!
[0:03:23] <%DesertPenguin> They're not that big, you're just taking your time
[0:03:25] <+Shin_true92> the point is to have fun....
[0:03:32] <%gibbityhibbity> Just use the cheats so getting the collectibles is real easy
[0:03:33] <%FuqBoiSlim> wait what the fuck why is my name grey
[0:03:36] <@Menitta> doot
[0:03:40] <%Lightwolfe> A gift for the early boys
[0:03:40] <%FuqBoiSlim> it used to be red
[0:03:41] <xanerts> thats true
[0:03:47] <goodakuma> wut
[0:03:47] <+TheBigTaco> I disagree, I think its fair
[0:03:48] <%DesertPenguin> All this talking, I don't see any demons being killed Woolie....
[0:03:48] <%mikesapartment> play game
[0:03:54] <ihateyouo> i disagree
[0:03:56] <%mitchteck> Ya
[0:04:04] <vVAstrAVv> the missions are probably way shorter when youre tearing through with no secrets to hunt down
[0:04:08] <+YabbaTroll> its just real bad for this format of lp
[0:04:08] <%DesertPenguin> Because they want you to play the game more. REPLAY VALUE
[0:04:10] <goodakuma> i agree to disagree
[0:04:11] <@Solidus_113> you can dash through the levels pretty quick, very few of the battle rooms are that difficult once you know what spawns
[0:04:17] <+Shin_true92> it's for al the xp
[0:04:18] <megamonmon123> I get you woolie
[0:04:22] <n3ls1s> i disagree
[0:04:24] <%DesertPenguin> I understand, but there are solutions
[0:04:26] <joshua_42> It would be neat if there was a void in Eternal
[0:04:27] <%Lightwolfe> lot of people can go eat ass
[0:04:28] <megamonmon123> What you are saying makes sense
[0:04:29] <+OUTheTeam> yea no idea why they decided that
[0:04:31] <goodakuma> The Camera sucks in Astral Chain
[0:04:31] <Dingo_Eejit> Oh no, someone thinks Eternal isn't perfect - how can this be!?!?!?!
[0:04:37] <goodakuma> zoomer
[0:04:37] <%RioGascar> It could be the design itself being more arcadelike
[0:04:48] <goodakuma> eternatus
[0:04:51] <%GoldeNOVA> Not everyone has limitless free time, guys
[0:04:53] <%Josef_Stryker> I guess the idea is to blaze through the level first then fast travel for cleanup.
[0:04:58] <%Shishi1205> Dashing makes it easier to travel
[0:05:04] <megamonmon123> I will say,missions in this game go WAY faster on a replay
[0:05:05] <%GeneralSCPatton> Replays should go faster because you aren't exploring everything and have more upgrades.
[0:05:10] <%gatorafan> I heard eating ass, what's going on? daedra1DerpyTibs
[0:05:18] <+JD0394> been waiting for this
[0:05:25] <dante_9x> VoHiYo
[0:05:31] <%RioGascar> Wait theres fast travel
[0:05:38] <goodakuma> there are no restrictions in a game about killing demons
[0:05:39] <%DesertPenguin> You'll be fine
[0:05:45] <megamonmon123> fast travel at the end yes
[0:05:46] <%Shishi1205> Fast travel unlocks at the end of the mision
[0:05:57] <%RioGascar> oh right
[0:06:00] <%tearfuldevil> yes, we all know
[0:06:13] <%gatorafan> @shishi1205, that's weird. Feels counterproductive to LPing
[0:06:16] <+YabbaTroll> the only solution seems to be ending the stream at the fast travel point, which sucks
[0:06:17] <goodakuma> well yes, but actually no
[0:06:20] <%Shishi1205> Kinda
[0:06:35] <%Shishi1205> Pat did say something about this too but then something that was useful
[0:06:39] <%gatorafan> Oh, nvm end of mission
[0:06:43] <%gatorafan> I read end of game
[0:06:43] <%Shishi1205> @WoolieVersus Ask him about it
[0:06:45] <Darren716> Just play the levels as you go through it, and do clean up once you hit the end of the level
[0:06:48] <goodakuma> Pat says lots of things
[0:07:12] <%RioGascar> Its an issue that would probably never be fixed or thought about. it sounds like something a normal user would never encounter
[0:07:14] <%gatorafan> @goodakuma, yeah, but he's very loud so... Who knows? Kappa
[0:07:24] <%Shishi1205> I remember he said something about not being able to tp but then he said that he was wrong. But we do know how Pat is
[0:07:40] <Cybermancer> Fast travel in Doom Eternal is not really about replaying a level, its more about helping secret hunting
[0:07:54] <goodakuma> @gatorafan Loud Voice = I'm right
[0:08:12] <%BinaryFireball> Binary_Fireball subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months, currently on a 4 month streak! Imagine if snakes had toes guys... it would be too much power.
[0:08:13] <%Shishi1205> Don't worry about maxing the weapons
[0:08:19] <%Shishi1205> You get help for that later
[0:08:30] <%RioGascar> Even then you cant “replay” and “train” on old missions with the fast travel cause enemies dont respawn
[0:08:40] <megamonmon123> gonna just have to not miss secrets
[0:08:40] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:08:42] <%mikesapartment> maxing out weapons made 2016 too easy for you, there's no need
[0:08:48] <%tearfuldevil> @Binary_Fireball their ribs are toes
[0:08:49] <+TheBigTaco> Ehhhhhh
[0:08:59] <Hal10k> Fast travel unlocks at the end because otherwise it would break the scripting
[0:08:59] <+Yamchadassist> @WoolieVersus after getting the big gun and other cheats youll dash through the levels in like minutes easy
[0:09:03] <+JD0394> we'll have to agree to disagree on this one
[0:09:07] <goodakuma> Does Doom Guy shit?
[0:09:07] <@Solidus_113> well, you got one RIGHT at the start of this stream
[0:09:14] <%BinaryFireball> @tearknack I want to die now
[0:09:15] <%Shishi1205> You have one soon
[0:09:18] <+IncredibleMeh> If you think the level length in Eternal is exhausting, I've been playing classic Doom and those levels are HUGE
[0:09:19] <+segmentedfool> @woolieversus there are some easy ways to get mastery. you keep progress between loading checkpoints so you can pop one turret reload and then keep doing that
[0:09:22] <+TomDanksEGOT> what game was he talkin about?
[0:09:23] <%DesertPenguin> No worries dude, we un derstand how you feel
[0:09:26] <%Shishi1205> The slayer gates don't fuck around
[0:09:26] <%tearfuldevil> @JD0394 no we dont
[0:09:39] <%RioGascar> So are you wanting to he able to replay encounters specifically?
[0:09:40] <megamonmon123> only solution for you woolie would be cheats
[0:09:41] <%GoldeNOVA> How dare you not wanna blast through 3h of gameplay for the one thing you wanna get? woolieSMUG
[0:09:43] <%jinking79> to bad we can't tell Woolie to not worry bout the weapon
[0:09:46] <akman14> @goodakuma His suit converts his shit to protein bars
[0:10:01] <goodakuma> it would
[0:10:09] <@Menitta> they do. just one
[0:10:11] <@Menitta> Kappa
[0:10:15] <brothernerofgc> Woolie have you heard of NullDC netplay
[0:10:16] <%Irridium> what if the tail was just one big toe

[0:12:39] <goodakuma> Meatboy Reggie
[0:12:50] <%Shishi1205> Tell woolie not to worry about the tedious mastery challenges for the weapons, Eternal helps you with that at the end of the game.
[0:12:52] <+maenos2> wait steak? I thought he said snake
[0:12:57] <%JustYudha> Any pics?
[0:12:57] <%Captain_Aham> Treat Yo Self
[0:13:00] <+YabbaTroll> wth are meat sweats? is that an old man thing?
[0:13:07] <+kralec> @WoolieVersus watch out, if you eat a lot of protein you also get REALLY gassy.
[0:13:08] <%tearfuldevil> @YabbaTroll yes
[0:13:10] <%jinking79> thicc dump
[0:13:12] <+YabbaTroll> oh man
[0:13:16] <%GelatinBoi> off topic but woolie's zip-up is super cool
[0:13:16] <+Dhamilt> So it was packed with protein then
[0:13:20] <%Shishi1205> Meat is OD
[0:13:21] <goodakuma> pics or it didn't happen
[0:13:30] <greynob> salty bet wehn
[0:13:31] <%jinking79> was the toilet ok Reg
[0:13:32] <+kralec> @YabbaTroll it's the idea that if you eat a ton of protein, your body has to use a lot of energy to break it down. This causes you get literally sweat from the exertion.
[0:13:36] <%gamewarden92> woolieCHAN
[0:13:45] <randominternetsurfer> @gamewarden92 hello
[0:13:52] <@Solidus_113> more like 5 minutes

[0:15:02] <%Shishi1205> twice
[0:15:03] <%doomerskeletor13> This level kinda flows right in to the next
[0:15:06] <RichochetForce> Yes, Wiseman V speaks truth.
[0:15:07] <Darren716> I was not happy

[0:19:05] <%GeneralSCPatton> You must scream very loud to reach Woolie 30 seconds in the past. Negative latency screaming.
[0:19:07] <%TerumiYuki> punching the box does not lock the purple room
[0:19:09] <Darren716> I think woolie would have been fine
[0:19:10] <UvBenServed> I pretty sure you can get past that box after dropping it
[0:19:17] <megamonmon123> you can
[0:19:18] <AntifaCatboy> Didn't need to restart, the gate that blocks the door to the slayer gate after you punch the box can be opened after punching the big guy.

[0:24:56] <%ChoculaUltra> damn, thought we were gonna see some sick cancel tech
[0:24:56] <%RioGascar> This one is the weapon switching learning time
[0:25:02] <+ItsCaptainDisco> I am ready
[0:25:02] <+GeneralHysterics> the game is set up so that you can walk in with 1 hp, no ammo, no armor and you can walk out of a fight with a full stack. don't stress it
[0:25:03] <UvBenServed> It skips animation if you're on a different gun
[0:25:04] <+jepupu> Has there been training since the last time?
[0:25:04] <megamonmon123> it nullifies the animation on different weapon
[0:25:05] <Sleepsie_> What difficulty is this?
[0:25:08] <@Solidus_113> learn to use all weapons
[0:25:08] <%doomerskeletor13> Anyone else feel like the final Slayer Gate is kind of a victory lap?
[0:25:13] <RichochetForce> It BEGINS!
[0:25:14] <Cybermancer> the animation is only gone if you switch from a different weapon
[0:25:19] <huskarl_zap> ah yes this
[0:25:21] <%WanderingSwordsman> it works when switching weapons
[0:25:22] <%RioGascar> Gate 2: learn weapon swapping
[0:25:22] <%invader_rin> Lol, did Woolie forget you teleport?
[0:25:24] <@Solidus_113> SourPls

[0:25:45] <akman14> Why does woolie go close to the mancubuses?
[0:25:57] <RichochetForce> Mancubi are sexy, that's why.
[0:26:04] <MONSTR_UwU> T H I C C
[0:26:04] <+YabbaTroll> his punch instincts are too strong
[0:26:20] <%doomerskeletor13> I think I got this one first try but just barely. It was probably luck more than anything else
[0:26:23] <%Shishi1205> Prowler boys

[0:26:40] <@Solidus_113> oh fuck Prowlers
[0:26:42] <%RioGascar> Its too fun
[0:26:54] <alexandrecau> wonder if Woolie even noticed the prowler
[0:26:54] <+jepupu> Reggie is a pretty good hype man nowadays. I can almost hear his buttcheeks clenching at times.
[0:26:55] <%doomerskeletor13> Meathook became my go to in these gates for getting around quickly
[0:27:00] <Kalinflip> @FuqBoiSlim well we are attracted to things that look like our parents

[0:27:17] <megamonmon123> does woolie know he can switch back to regular grenades?
[0:27:33] <%RioGascar> I forget to do that tbf
[0:27:35] <+TheBigTaco> it does look much harder to do this with a controller
[0:27:37] <akman14> Thanks ammo bag!
[0:27:38] <%doomerskeletor13> He does, he’s just juggling a lot of mechanics
[0:27:45] <Kalinflip> @TheBigTaco Its not
[0:27:47] <MONSTR_UwU> nades cyro, fire all the options
[0:27:47] <%RioGascar> games got a ton of mechanics to remember in battle
[0:27:50] <Brutalyte616> In case you aren't aware, shotgun and super shotgun share ammo.
[0:27:50] <%paladinstarbuster> it is thp
[0:28:01] <+GeneralHysterics> I gotta say, this is a marked improvement from the first session
[0:28:03] <alexandrecau> I mean he has twon live
[0:28:22] <%doomerskeletor13> Reggie being a good hype man

[0:29:55] <turbofolk> Tiniest V

[0:31:20] <%doomerskeletor13> @alexandrecau Nah I’m just saying V was probably on a higher difficulty which is why it took him 40 minutes
[0:31:21] <%RioGascar> Also i think ultra violence is normal
[0:31:21] <RichochetForce> 100% Album ccover.
[0:31:23] <%Solidnick18> Kreygasm
[0:31:23] <%RioGascar> not hard
[0:31:25] <UvBenServed> Thanks Demon Jesus
[0:31:27] <MONSTR_UwU> wow didnt beat UN on extra life mode on first try? casual
[0:31:28] <%GeneralSCPatton> CRUCIBRIDGE
[0:31:29] <randominternetsurfer> it literally is
[0:31:29] <awalr> that's a concept art right there
[0:31:31] <+Taglog7> fly me to the moon
[0:31:32] <%paladinstarbuster> i wanna fight that
[0:31:34] <hassanico2> Is this still the Ice Fortress level?
[0:31:36] <+ItsCaptainDisco> He's having a good time, this guy
[0:31:41] <phantalime> it literally is one
[0:31:42] <%Josef_Stryker> It absolutely is a collectible vinyl cover in the game.
[0:31:43] <+segmentedfool> Ultra Violence is the difficulty the entire game is balanced around
[0:31:44] <+GeneralHysterics> It would be way less fun on harder difficulties. The Capital G Gamer attitude "I have to play on the hardest difficulty" is asinine and off putting.
[0:31:46] <+meatmaaan> quick dashing counts as melee and is actually stronger than the non blood punch melee
[0:31:46] <%FuqBoiSlim> cultist base yeah
[0:31:47] <+TheBigTaco> @alexandrecau I mean when reggie immediately starts going 'easy shit" I get a bit salty after taking 10 attempts lol
[0:31:47] <randominternetsurfer> @paladinstarbuster hehehe
[0:31:51] <RichochetForce> @awalr This generation we've seen concept art created almost 1:1 without compromise in-game.

[0:34:16] <megamonmon123> This area was hell for me on ultraviolence
[0:34:18] <%doomerskeletor13> It’s wild to me that the same guy who voices Wally West on YJ voices is voicing the Hell Priest
[0:34:19] <turbofolk> No excuse
[0:34:24] <+MeatBomb> Super Shotty is so good.
[0:34:25] <Desciple_of_hype> LETS GGOOOOO
[0:34:26] <%J0RD4NPR1M3> J0RD4NPR1M3 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 2 month streak! Hey we're in the 1st trimester of the stream baby. Thank you Woolie, Reggie, and Minh for providing awesome content for such a long time. Good luck to you all in these strange times. KA *EN TUK!
[0:34:30] <%tearfuldevil> @Solidus_113 this game on master level is a fuck
[0:34:35] <RichochetForce> @lewdskeletor13 The range on some voice actors is incredible.
[0:34:35] <+meatmaaan> yeah I was really taken out of the game by there being no lore reason for toys and cheat codes hidden all over the place
[0:34:43] <+meatmaaan> Kappa
[0:34:50] <%doomerskeletor13> Kappa
[0:34:53] <%Shishi1205> you better start using multiple weapons
[0:35:06] <Darren716> STICKY BOMB
[0:35:07] <%GeneralSCPatton> @j0rd4npr1m3 He's not going to get the KAR EN TUK reference yet.
[0:35:09] <%paladinstarbuster> sticky bomb them
[0:35:09] <randominternetsurfer> use the meathook
[0:35:18] <@Solidus_113> you already got the challenges
[0:35:19] <1matheuw> sticky the turret for mastery
[0:35:22] <ChokeOnMyChicken> Is thos scrub using a controller for an fps game
[0:35:25] <%RioGascar> i think the slow down has caused him to forget the meathook
[0:35:31] <%BinaryFireball> sticky bomb is the shit
[0:35:32] <Darren716> He still needs to sticky them for the master
[0:35:38] <%tearfuldevil> @ChokeOnMyChicken you are clearly new
[0:35:38] <%Shishi1205> meaty boy
[0:35:42] <MayorRev> huge MEAT

[0:35:56] <hassanico2> Ah Wooly not liking the SNEK DEMONS is he?
[0:36:01] <@Solidus_113> Nobody's talking about the gore tech in this game. There's so much detail on blowing skin and muscle off
[0:36:07] <%doomerskeletor13> I feel like the plasma rifle worked really well on the hell knights
[0:36:18] <RichochetForce> @Solidus_113 It's one of the best health bar replacements I've ever seen
[0:36:23] <RichochetForce> 100% Diegetic goodness

[0:36:40] <RAH001> oh no im late for da viewing of da devil game
[0:36:40] <$realm_forge> Never be afraid to use your big weapons on the sneks
[0:36:41] <megamonmon123> our fps newb is growing
[0:36:44] <Kirbachev> @Solidus_113 I fucking LOVE the damage modelling on the enemies. It's so satisfying.
[0:36:45] <megamonmon123> im.so proud
[0:36:46] <hassanico2> My favorite damage indicator to hear when fighting is "CRITICAL DAMAGE". It feels good for some reason.

[0:38:15] <Kirbachev> Are you motivated yet, Mr. Krabs?

[0:38:34] <%Shishi1205> Check map if there's no question you are done
[0:38:35] <%doomerskeletor13> They should add a style bar to complete the transition in to first person DMC
[0:38:37] <%FuqBoiSlim> WE WON STADIABROS WE WOM Kappa
[0:38:41] <alexandrecau> Nah one guy is gonna tell woolie about trying to get the gold ending in metro 2033 and Woolie is gonna get paralyzed tryign to do it

[0:38:49] <Brutalyte616> There's a power-up behind a wall.
[0:38:50] <%MattDemers> Does the game balance for controller at all? Has Woolie been doing okay?
[0:38:51] <chromonaut747> there is
[0:38:57] <hassanico2> @lewdskeletor13 and getting SSS triggers one of the 4 powerups
[0:38:59] <1matheuw> @lewdskeletor13 i think the arcade mode is just that
[0:39:01] <megamonmon123> Its time chat
[0:39:03] <chromonaut747> hidden power up
[0:39:03] <hassanico2> Level End
[0:39:04] <DedlokPM> @ChoculaUltra Partially correct. It is coming to Steam at the same time as Stadia. The Exclusivity only affects the console release for some reason
[0:39:04] <@Solidus_113> Stadia is technically a console, so it's "console" exclusive
[0:39:05] <%invader_rin> Best level up next
[0:39:06] <hassanico2> Nice
[0:39:08] <MONSTR_UwU> i play on controller in PC LUL

[0:42:23] <RichochetForce> @Javaa01 Aye

[0:43:13] <brunoberserk> look aa this VIDEOGAME

[0:44:20] <1matheuw> vegabot
[0:44:23] <hassanico2> POWER UP
[0:44:25] <%DesertPenguin> Plasma wave!
[0:44:26] <%Shishi1205> get the blast
[0:44:30] <@Solidus_113> Heat Blast is much better this time
[0:44:31] <Darren716> BLAST
[0:44:33] <Visorak6> heat blast is a shotgun
[0:44:33] <%BinaryFireball> plasma is dumb
[0:44:34] <megamonmon123> heat blast is great
[0:44:34] <%Solidnick18> heat blast
[0:44:36] <RichochetForce> Heat Blast is disgusting
[0:44:37] <+GeneralHysterics> heat blast is worth it
[0:44:37] <%Solidnick18> yeeyeye
[0:44:38] <chromonaut747> BLAST
[0:44:39] <%dekkitout> Beam- do it woolieU
[0:44:40] <RunningNGunning> blast is gud
[0:44:42] <chromonaut747> BEAM IS TRASH
[0:44:42] <hassanico2> Microwave is a cool concept but pooooorly executed
[0:44:44] <stanlychicken> take microwave lol
[0:44:45] <%Chichen> blast for sure
[0:44:47] <gunsrlove> OOOVACHAGE HEAT-O
[0:44:48] <%doomerskeletor13> Heat Blast is the goat
[0:44:48] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @vVAstrAVv you got a bit of game left, bruh
[0:44:50] <%Javaa01> Heat Blast is good, but Microwave Beam was buffed last week to be genuinely great
[0:44:51] <+greenfall> heat blast is super usefull
[0:44:52] <awalr> @vVAstrAVv theres quite a bit left
[0:44:54] <%DesertPenguin> Microwave Beam is a good finisher because when upgraded
[0:44:57] <MONSTR_UwU> they buffed microwave iirc,but haven't used it
[0:44:57] <hassanico2> Oh wait it got buffed?!
[0:44:58] <RichochetForce> @hassanico2 Yup, it runs counter to the design goals of the game.
[0:44:58] <$realm_forge> yeyeyeyeye!
[0:45:09] <$realm_forge> That is the correct choice
[0:45:11] <%DesertPenguin> Microwave wasn't in 2016 so how was it buffed?
[0:45:11] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @vVAstrAVv this is like 25%
[0:45:16] <%Solidnick18> the mastery is great
[0:45:20] <hassanico2> @DesertPenguin since initial release I mean
[0:45:21] <%doomerskeletor13> Upgraded heat blast is disgustingly good
[0:45:22] <%DesertPenguin> ah
[0:45:24] <%gibbityhibbity> Don't forget challenges tho
[0:45:26] <%DesertPenguin> What did they buff?
[0:45:27] <%DesertPenguin> How*
[0:45:30] <%Javaa01> Yeah, the buff basically doubled the DPS on Microwave
[0:45:35] <%DesertPenguin> ooooooooooooo
[0:45:35] <%RioGascar> however have fun remembering to swap mods, weapons, grenades and then remembering all the other mechanics
[0:45:36] <RichochetForce> Yeah, the heat blast mastery turns the plasma rifle into an electric gorilla
[0:45:40] <1matheuw> would you like more dps on your dps gun woolie?
[0:45:40] <Dingo_Eejit> Get Improved Verting, just like Eric woulda got
[0:45:47] <%RioGascar> I basically never swapped mods in combat once
[0:45:48] <vVAstrAVv> thnks guys <3. better start redownloading it lol
[0:45:51] <hassanico2> The thing used to take like 5 seconds to blow up Imps and Zombies
[0:45:51] <Visorak6> micro missiles got nerfed they're weak to rely on
[0:45:58] <Darren716> Upgrade sniper id say
[0:45:59] <%Shishi1205> Wait for the patch for doom pc
[0:46:01] <chromonaut747> all in ss
[0:46:06] <+GeneralHysterics> reload is attack speed
[0:46:11] <+GeneralHysterics> it's gr8
[0:46:13] <%Shishi1205> SS
[0:46:13] <%DesertPenguin> On the bottom of the screen it says R3 to customize weapon wheel. You can pick what goes in what spot now?!?!?!

[0:46:23] <%J0RD4NPR1M3> make good gun gooder?
[0:46:23] <1matheuw> meat hook evolves into > flame hook
[0:46:23] <%GeneralSCPatton> Mastered Super Shotty solves your armor problem forever
[0:46:26] <%doomerskeletor13> breebuGun meathook

[0:46:27] <@Solidus_113> you have meathook DI
[0:46:28] <hassanico2> Since I mentioned Serious Sam, man the double-barrel in that is just the Super SHotgun isn't it?
[0:46:28] <%Shishi1205> Kreygasm
[0:46:28] <%Javaa01> Yeah, you can customize the weapon wheel layout
[0:46:29] <1matheuw> clip that
[0:46:31] <gunsrlove> Kreygasm
[0:46:33] <awalr> @DesertPenguin you can even remove things entirely from the wheel if you feel like it
[0:46:33] <megamonmon123> CLIP THAT
[0:46:34] <%ChoculaUltra> Reggie (Wet)
[0:46:34] <MONSTR_UwU> chat how does one farm exp in doom?

[0:46:51] <%Javaa01> @DesertPenguin That's been there since launch
[0:46:57] <%doomerskeletor13> @monstr_uwu You get weapon points from the levels
[0:47:01] <%DesertPenguin> Wow, surprised I never noticed
[0:47:01] <%Josef_Stryker> Thank you Reggie for telling him woolieGASM
[0:47:02] <%Javaa01> If you didn't see it, then you didn't read
[0:47:03] <vVAstrAVv> woolie kept quiet cus he knew how clippable that was
[0:47:07] <kronostorm34> KET ON MY DICK PepePls
[0:47:08] <thebehatted> this requires some research
[0:47:12] <%DesertPenguin> Hey dont' be rude lol
[0:47:18] <MONSTR_UwU> cool
[0:47:20] <%doomerskeletor13> You can pull off some crazy moves with the right combinations
[0:47:20] <@Solidus_113> your dash won't charge mid air
[0:47:22] <hassanico2> Isn't there a platform under the monkey bar?
[0:47:23] <%Javaa01> Swinging doesn't give you a dash refill
[0:47:31] <%DesertPenguin> just a jump refill
[0:47:31] <RunningNGunning> Monkey bars refill jump, not dash
[0:47:32] <+OUTheTeam> you can also chainsaw at the end of the meathook. sick as hell
[0:47:43] <%Shishi1205> It does charge but its not renabled to be used
[0:47:44] <hassanico2> Nice!
[0:47:44] <%rsb2025> This build up woolieGASM
[0:47:49] <$realm_forge> Space out your dashes for distance
[0:47:51] <%Javaa01> Yeah, you can cancel the meathook into anything you want
[0:47:52] <hassanico2> COOKIE :)
[0:47:56] <UvBenServed> Thanks *punch*
[0:47:56] <1matheuw> no bully the ghost bois
[0:47:57] <RichochetForce> I always punch them accidentally
[0:48:05] <%J0RD4NPR1M3> it's kinda weird cuz sometimes you can dash into walls and sometimes you just fall short
[0:48:06] <%Shishi1205> Dakness
[0:48:07] <awalr> bitch knight ghost
[0:48:08] <%arcielardor> THANK YOU FOR PANCAKE

[0:49:07] <%doomerskeletor13> I love Pinky
[0:49:09] <MONSTR_UwU> what if you punch hard enough
[0:49:11] <+jepupu> I hope you get the Protip if Cyberdemon is in this game.
[0:49:17] <hassanico2> It's probably an MP4 with it's own volume?
[0:49:17] <%arcielardor> it's time for angry cupcakes
[0:49:17] <fist_wizard_jay> Swerve around and blast the ass
[0:49:18] <thebehatted> pinky is A N G E R Y

[0:49:28] <+Sleepy_Puma> Pinky no slouch
[0:49:29] <+TheBigTaco> theres some weird sound bugs in this game
[0:49:30] <%Javaa01> He will definitely get the Cyberdemon tip once he gets fucked by that one Slayer Gate
[0:49:32] <awalr> pinkies probably taste like pork send tweet
[0:49:33] <dante_9x> i think pinky get nerfed from 2016

[0:49:55] <%doomerskeletor13> Gotta go fast like Sanic
[0:49:55] <+Ether101_Prime> Not a fan of how demons fly between platforms in this game.
[0:50:02] <+TheBigTaco> Theres a bug where if you die, the music dies down for the next 10 seconds and then abruptly starts up again
[0:50:04] <+TheBigTaco> its weird
[0:50:08] <%dekkitout> Meathook Track Drifting?!

[0:50:33] <Zannablu_ke> doom mood
[0:50:35] <%Javaa01> You can do some stupid launches with the Meathook if you know what you're doing
[0:50:35] <%andrex2311> SourPls
[0:50:39] <+Sleepy_Puma> god this cultist base track is so good
[0:50:48] <%doomerskeletor13> Release your plasma load woolieSMUG
[0:50:49] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:50:54] <%Javaa01> As in launch yourself around an enemy and propel yourself like a full 70m forward
[0:50:55] <%GoldeNOVA> SADISTIC
[0:50:58] <dante_9x> or maybe slayer get buff with dash that make pinky a joke
[0:51:22] <+Nyxshade> BIG TIP: Pinkies always die in one Blood Punch, no matter what.
[0:51:26] <%J0RD4NPR1M3> I wish the meathook could grab walls like in the Doomexp mod
[0:51:35] <%Shishi1205> change to sticky
[0:51:56] <%paladinstarbuster> this isnt H-DOOM
[0:51:58] <%Shishi1205> dont meele my dude
[0:51:59] <RichochetForce> Woolie 2020: "Dont Face Fuck It"

[0:52:02] <%Solidnick18> SourPls
[0:52:10] <%doomerskeletor13> Don’t rely on melee breebuGun
[0:52:11] <%Javaa01> Facefucking enemies without a gameplan just gets you fucked
[0:52:18] <+ItsCaptainDisco> This makes my b-hole clench
[0:52:19] <chromonaut747> melee is grabo
[0:52:22] <hassanico2> Did Rocket Launcher get anything in updates?
[0:52:24] <+RyTYoung> TOO MANY COOKS, great show LUL

[0:52:34] <%Shishi1205> Sticky has the iron sight
[0:52:37] <@Solidus_113> yes
[0:52:43] <hassanico2> I heard the rockets in this one doesn't feel too great despite being stronger than 2016
[0:52:49] <%Shishi1205> Bad woolie. No melee
[0:52:51] <%doomerskeletor13> Nice
[0:52:59] <%RioGascar> Im just impressed he managed to remember weapon mod swapping
[0:53:04] <megamonmon123> Woolie is doing well
[0:53:07] <%Shishi1205> We need a water spray wooliePOYO
[0:53:12] <%doomerskeletor13> Melee is very nerfed to make the blood punch useful
[0:53:14] <%RioGascar> literally never did i once swap mods during combat
[0:53:26] <+YabbaTroll> yo hes doing it
[0:53:26] <dante_9x> flame woolie
[0:53:27] <%GeneralSCPatton> He clutch
[0:53:30] <+Ether101_Prime> Does the Super Shotgun do more damage when Meat Hook is being used?
[0:53:31] <+MeatBomb> Yo.
[0:53:32] <%biggdaddymike> biggdaddymike subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! woolieGASM
[0:53:33] <dante_9x> nice
[0:53:45] <1matheuw> um
[0:53:45] <vVAstrAVv> daaaaaqmn woolies gotten waaaay better
[0:53:46] <+OUTheTeam> man woolz is doing so much better than the the first session
[0:53:48] <awalr> i think they also nerfed melee so glory kills take a little bit more effort to set up than a double tap on a fodder
[0:53:49] <DedlokPM> Snek
[0:53:52] <%Shishi1205> Dashing deals more dmg than melee FeelsBadMan
[0:53:54] <%BreakersAweigh> SNEK
[0:53:54] <@Solidus_113> I love how this song grooves
[0:53:55] <SixthSun2> SNEK from HELL
[0:53:55] <+maenos2> snek
[0:53:59] <%SuperKirby24> SNEK
[0:54:02] <+VidulaSaix> TEAMSNEK
[0:54:04] <1matheuw> the snek has been vanquished
[0:54:04] <%Josef_Stryker> SNEK

[0:54:04] <%andrex2311> snek
[0:54:05] <%BinaryFireball> SNEK WITH TOES
[0:54:07] <+YabbaTroll> eyyy
[0:54:07] <%dekkitout> Boop that snek
[0:54:11] <dante_9x> SNEK gotta go
[0:54:11] <%doomerskeletor13> It’s Reggies favorite
[0:54:13] <%Javaa01> @Shishi1205 Dashing into enemies does the same damage as a regular slap in 2016
[0:54:14] <+Ether101_Prime> There's a secret here.
[0:54:14] <RichochetForce> Yeah, Whiplashes have to go.
[0:54:15] <%tearfuldevil> BOOB
[0:54:16] <%GeneralSCPatton> SNEX sweetc2Gasm
[0:54:27] <%GoldeNOVA> Mick goes to sleep
[0:54:29] <chromonaut747> secrettt
[0:54:40] <%tearfuldevil> BATTERY
[0:54:41] <%dekkitout> We only pander to the sneks with the venom sacks PunOko
[0:54:42] <+Nyxshade> I never found Whiplashes to be anything scary, what do they even do?
[0:54:48] <%Javaa01> Puzzles and thinking
[0:54:48] <%RioGascar> The duality of twitch chat: snek gotta go, snek please step on me
[0:54:51] <mdkcde> Look for a vent
[0:54:52] <@Solidus_113> they throw reppukens
[0:54:55] <1matheuw> look for a hole
[0:54:59] <+MeatBomb> Is it cannon that Doom Guy hears this music in his head or his helmet?
[0:55:05] <RichochetForce> @Nyxshade They get behind you and whip you + fire homing reppukens
[0:55:06] <%doomerskeletor13> @nyxshade They just move around fast and can be frustrating to hit sometimes
[0:55:08] <awalr> they sexily slither
[0:55:10] <mdkcde> Look for a breakable vent on the floor
[0:55:12] <wendigocannibal666> Don't forget the Mission Challenges! HahaTurtledove
[0:55:14] <randominternetsurfer> @nyxshade they 1 shot you at close range and their attacks are not easily dodgeable.
[0:55:16] <1matheuw> @MeatBomb sure why not
[0:55:16] <%Javaa01> @MeatBomb It's his mixtape
[0:55:18] <%KeslGames> COLDER
[0:55:18] <%tearfuldevil> @MeatBomb doomguy has RipAmdTearMix.mp3 on his PC
[0:55:20] <RichochetForce> They move REALLY low to the ground so most shots aimed at other enemies will miss.
[0:55:21] <chromonaut747> this one is pretty tough first time
[0:55:23] <%SuperKirby24> ... middle pillar iirc?
[0:55:26] <+Nyxshade> Thanks everyone
[0:55:27] <randominternetsurfer> @nyxshade they are DEATH in UN.
[0:55:27] <%KeslGames> WARMER
[0:55:28] <%Solidnick18> welp
[0:55:29] <RichochetForce> One of the best tracks of the game, right here.
[0:55:32] <+maenos2> pat couldn't find this hole for a while too as I recall
[0:55:32] <%KeslGames> COLDER
[0:55:41] <%KeslGames> WARMER
[0:55:43] <%Javaa01> The blindness is tangible right now
[0:55:51] <+kraajkase> well good thing hes still working on doom huh
[0:55:52] <+oda_flobunaga> IDK, Rammstein covers of the DOOM ost would be ...
[0:55:54] <%doomerskeletor13> It took me a while to find this one too
[0:55:59] <megamonmon123> its the crate right
[0:55:59] <DedlokPM> Well Bethesda is going to have to be without mick in the dlc and in the future doodSad
[0:56:01] <1matheuw> someone said the midle pillar
[0:56:02] <%KeslGames> COLDER
[0:56:05] <+YabbaTroll> oh no the exterior perimeter checking screwed him
[0:56:08] <megamonmon123> he has to punch a crate?
[0:56:08] <%KeslGames> WARMER
[0:56:10] <$realm_forge> I need an Iron Man edit where Reggie replaces Jarvis
[0:56:13] <%GeneralSCPatton> You perimeter swept while completely avoiding the center
[0:56:16] <+mechslayer71> Under the bridge @woolieversus
[0:56:19] <%Camail> has mick said anything after they responded to his comments
[0:56:20] <%Solidnick18> he will find it sometime
[0:56:20] <+flyscho95> wall hugging has failed him
[0:56:24] <+Nyxshade> I find it funny, because I beat the game but I could not remember what an entire enemy did.
[0:56:25] <%rosemon5001> wall huggin doesnt work because you miss more since you cut corners and dont look at everything
[0:56:27] <1matheuw> punch the crate people are saying
[0:56:27] <+adamthreetimes> Mick shouldn't have fucked up the bag.
[0:56:27] <%BallerSwagBro9k> BETHESDA HAD ONE JOB: Please Mick AND THEY FUCKED IT UP
[0:56:27] <+Ether101_Prime> If your going to explore the environment, you should actually explore all of it.
[0:56:33] <Dingo_Eejit> Hulshult could score a game like this with his fingers in his ears
[0:56:35] <%J0RD4NPR1M3> middle
[0:56:36] <+MeatBomb> How weird would this be to play WITHOUT the jams?
[0:56:37] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @WoolieVersus as much as I love Mick's soundtrack, the guy was missing deadlines and putting ID at risk for consumer protection law violations
[0:56:41] <%Javaa01> You've looked at everything except one part of this room, and you're constantly circling it while actively avoiding it

[0:58:16] <raikagelord1> What was dig up from agian?
[0:58:17] <%doomerskeletor13> I think I had some leftover batteries so the game definitely gives you enough
[0:58:17] <Hal10k> Crystals are by far the most valuable thing you can unlock
[0:58:23] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @BreakersAweigh that was a shining moment of the DS3 DLC playthrough
[0:58:25] <Darren716> Did pat seriously go for skins first? LUL

[0:58:45] <RichochetForce> Yeah, this blew my mind

[0:58:49] <%DesertPenguin> Completely retconning our history
[0:58:57] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @Camail then he should've let the PR guys at ID handle it
[0:58:59] <%GoldeNOVA> Aesthetics are important
[0:59:00] <%doomerskeletor13> breebuPog

[0:59:04] <%Javaa01> @Solidus_113 I mean he's gonna get it once he returns to the hub next so as long as he actually picks it up he should be able to just get the thing
[0:59:05] <%tearfuldevil> @DesertPenguin does anyone care? its metal

[0:59:32] <RichochetForce> Yup, giant native monsters
[0:59:45] <+mechslayer71> @camail He seemed pretty keen on communicating with all the fans who wanted him to fix the masters
[0:59:46] <%RioGascar> @camail Tbf that didnt stop him criticizing bethesdas marketing and other things prior games release. he acted unprofessional honestly for the whole gig
[0:59:48] <RichochetForce> Doesn't Telos = Earth?
[0:59:49] <%dekkitout> Cyborg-demon- MUTANTS!
[0:59:52] <lotharrio> Millenia ago, huh?
[0:59:53] <%Javaa01> They been making Tyrants
[1:00:02] <%tearfuldevil> @theanora1 no offense meant to Markipliers dad, but Woolie, me, and a lot of other people, would not know if we'd seen the man unless a bunch of people told us directly
[1:00:04] <%DesertPenguin> quickly? You mean publicly lol
[1:00:05] <%DesertPenguin> words are hard
[1:00:11] <raikagelord1> Is Aregent De Nur Earth? The newest wolfeinstin did confirm a Multiverse
[1:00:11] <%doomerskeletor13> The Ultimate Bio-Weapon
[1:00:24] <randominternetsurfer> @riogascar yeah, because they poorly mixed his soundtrack. let's not act like they're flawless here.

[1:00:57] <raikagelord1> Ah ok
[1:01:03] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @randominternetsurfer did you read the response at all?
[1:01:19] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @randominternetsurfer they didn't have the masters to work with and had dates to meet
[1:01:23] <@Solidus_113> this mission is your whole session'
[1:01:26] <RichochetForce> Don't get GOT, get GUUD
[1:01:30] <%doomerskeletor13> So the Doom Hunter isn’t even really a demon
[1:01:32] <%DesertPenguin> Yea, this is the session, just take your time
[1:01:46] <%DesertPenguin> You might get through some of the next mission, but be focused on this one for now
[1:01:46] <@Solidus_113> monkaS
[1:01:53] <%RioGascar> @randominternetsurfethats not what im referring to. he tweeted out stuff he probably shouldn’t have prior to games launch such as the TV ad
[1:01:57] <RichochetForce> Haha
[1:01:59] <randominternetsurfer> @reverend_roscoe yeah, but Mick complaining about Bethesda marketing was before that, and we don't know Mick's side of the story.

[1:02:46] <%Camail> 6-4 if its online
[1:02:47] <%DesertPenguin> He looks like a Doom enemy because Doom was before all that
[1:02:52] <Visorak6> It's almost identical to a necron destroyer yeah
[1:02:53] <%Javaa01> Yeah, it's explicitly just a fuckin Nekron
[1:02:54] <%ChoculaUltra> Another one of those wacky Zeon one offs that cost them the war
[1:02:54] <huskarl_zap> Its a Necron destroyer rip off
[1:02:55] <raikagelord1> @lewdskeletor13 no just an ancient race resurrected and take control of through cybernetics.
[1:02:56] <$realm_forge> Thats a nekron destroyer on meth
[1:02:56] <%Captain_Aham> dude's tier list is all fucked up
[1:03:00] <RichochetForce> @DesertPenguin But Gundam is from the 70s.

[1:03:40] <%andrex2311> LUL LUL
[1:03:40] <awalr> there's some dumb invisible kill walls in this

[1:04:02] <@Solidus_113> that's not QA
[1:04:03] <%SuperKirby24> yeah, there's some stupid death areas LUL
[1:04:05] <%DesertPenguin> hahhaahah
[1:04:09] <%GeneralSCPatton> USE YOUR EYES. NOT SPECIAL EYES OR EYES ON THE INSIDE. JUST REGULAR EYES.
[1:04:13] <%doomerskeletor13> I made the same mistake Woolie
[1:04:18] <+RyTYoung> "Grr I hate Parkour" said doom guy LUL
[1:04:23] <%dekkitout> @GeneralSCPatton Their 4 sets of eyes
[1:04:25] <%DesertPenguin> You.... did it
[1:04:25] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus just buy the dash charge skill, you have the points for it
[1:04:27] <dfs_k> literally not a single person except woolie went left there
[1:04:28] <%J0RD4NPR1M3> I made that mistake the first time
[1:04:29] <%Camail> death wall
[1:04:39] <+drsaltneo> Your dash will come back, you just have to wait a little longer on the wall
[1:05:05] <+RyTYoung> L3 click for dashing is the way to go
[1:05:05] <%doomerskeletor13> It’s very funny that the interact and punch button are the same
[1:05:05] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:05:07] <%GeneralSCPatton> Nice flame and glory

[1:06:41] <+NWannabe> wtf, tribe ref in 20202.
[1:06:46] <%DesertPenguin> From wikipedia: electronic music group, who blend instrumental hip hop, reggae, moombahton and dubstep-influenced dance music with elements of First Nations music, particularly vocal chanting and drumming.
[1:06:48] <+NWannabe> did not see that coming
[1:06:54] <+oda_flobunaga> They just released a new music video last month
[1:06:57] <%BinaryFireball> tribe called quest is the SHIIIIIIT
[1:06:57] <%doomerskeletor13> 20202? Damn we got a time traveler
[1:06:58] <@Solidus_113> Cooldown won't reset mid air
[1:07:04] <Louie_Salmon> That was weird actually
[1:07:04] <%DesertPenguin> Different tribe lol
[1:07:09] <lotharrio> There's a Mongolian heavy metal band called the Hu which is pretty good.
[1:07:11] <megamonmon123> it comes back on walls and on the ground
[1:07:12] <%gibbityhibbity> Your dash meter takes time to come back when you're on a wall
[1:07:13] <+NWannabe> lol, i just wke up
[1:07:14] <%Irridium> it recharges mid-air but doesn't reset
[1:07:15] <RichochetForce> @NWannabe Bro, did Half Life 3 get released?
[1:07:19] <%BinaryFireball> The Hu is also the shit
[1:07:21] <awalr> havent heard much from them but "electric pow wow drum" is a great track
[1:07:22] <%Javaa01> @WoolieVersus Your cooldown refreshes if you LAND on any surface, swinging off of Monkey Bars DOES NOT count as landing
[1:07:24] <+NWannabe> forgot to set my info release limiters
[1:07:26] <+ItsCaptainDisco> The HU are a really great band - Mongolian throat singing combined with metal
[1:07:31] <RichochetForce> Oh god

[1:09:07] <hassanico2> I'll take fucking ArchViles over Carcasses
[1:09:09] <%J0RD4NPR1M3> RIPANTEARBLOCKER
[1:09:17] <suddenlyscorched> Even in death, they serve the Omnissiah
[1:09:18] <%DesertPenguin> TOTAL WASTE
[1:09:21] <RogueMinja> Check challenges.
[1:09:22] <%dekkitout> Despite being red as fuck, Hell is quite green
[1:09:23] <%DesertPenguin> I'M CRYING
[1:09:36] <%DesertPenguin> Missiles are so usless
[1:09:41] <%DesertPenguin> They use up your ammo twice as fast
[1:09:47] <+kralec> @dekkitout go green! the devil approves. rooDevil
[1:10:00] <megamonmon123> what are you talking about? missiles are great
[1:10:01] <%doomerskeletor13> This level has challenges right?
[1:10:04] <%DesertPenguin> Great at what?
[1:10:08] <%Javaa01> No, they can die
[1:10:09] <%DesertPenguin> They don't stagger
[1:10:10] <megamonmon123> killing
[1:10:12] <%DesertPenguin> They use up too much ammo
[1:10:15] <@Solidus_113> I think you missed a rune
[1:10:16] <%DesertPenguin> And a rocket launcher does the job better
[1:10:19] <%Javaa01> But you need to strafe 3 enemies without letting go of the trigger
[1:10:19] <Kirbachev> Missile spam is fun, though
[1:10:21] <$realm_forge> You will have ample opportunities
[1:10:23] <%paladinstarbuster> you have to hit 3
[1:10:25] <dante_9x> always flame belch before glory kill
[1:10:35] <%GeneralSCPatton> CHECK MAP
[1:10:38] <$Invlux> damn that wouldve been good for all those weak dudes
[1:10:40] <badmr7> you just have to tag 3
[1:10:41] <+VidulaSaix> You can cycle Frag and Ice Woolie, I dont beleive they share a cooldown
[1:10:47] <%DesertPenguin> THey do not
[1:10:59] <awalr> love the missiles in 2016, the way they curve more through the air is oddly satisfying
[1:11:05] <dante_9x> he remember the frag PogChamp
[1:11:05] <Dingo_Eejit> Wait what has Woolie mixed up HIT with KILL?
[1:11:11] <Sarevic> missiles are OP fully upgraded. kill a fodder and you've got six seconds of automatic rocket launcher
[1:11:25] <badmr7> the micromissle challenge

[1:11:32] <%Irridium> you can stand on those but not grab them for some reason
[1:11:36] <%DesertPenguin> It's just like Doom 2016. There are green lights giving hints for where to jump
[1:11:39] <+aishman> NO DO IT

[1:14:54] <%thechungiestofbois> Would Woolie become a Hell Preist for a Jetpack?

[1:15:20] <1matheuw> please comit unlive tho
[1:15:21] <+VidulaSaix> Just die please :)
[1:15:27] <%J0RD4NPR1M3> die now, die later
[1:15:32] <%Shishi1205> Before and after
[1:15:38] <%Shishi1205> 3rd rune
[1:15:48] <%Javaa01> Nah, the spine rips are a little later
[1:15:56] <+VidulaSaix> Big recommend Air Control yet again
[1:16:00] <randominternetsurfer> AIR TRAVERSAL!!!!
[1:16:05] <Visorak6> air control
[1:16:06] <%doomerskeletor13> Air control is sick
[1:16:11] <%Shishi1205> Air DI is od
[1:16:14] <BlackermanZX> Aircontrol is big too
[1:16:16] <+YabbaTroll> I dunno if woolie can make use of air control, although it is dope
[1:16:16] <%Javaa01> You need air control so you don't jump into every hole on the map
[1:16:24] <%DesertPenguin> Air Control is good if you need it, but Woolie doesn't seem to be that mobile in the first place
[1:16:25] <%doomerskeletor13> Most of them are useful so any one works really
[1:16:29] <%DesertPenguin> So I don't think he'll utilize it
[1:16:29] <megamonmon123> I went with longer stagger honestly
[1:16:35] <%GeneralSCPatton> What was his second rune?
[1:16:37] <RichochetForce> The long stagger is almost broken
[1:16:43] <+mechslayer71> Faster
[1:16:44] <RichochetForce> They just become easy kills
[1:16:45] <%DesertPenguin> Equipment Fiend is the second one I think
[1:16:47] <+Estuko> lmfao my old boss texted me asking if I'd leave my job ($5more than prev) and come back since employees left.
[1:16:50] <%DesertPenguin> Which is almost required
[1:16:51] <@Solidus_113> you have a dash, there's no need to have a farther active length
[1:16:59] <%Javaa01> Longer stun is just for challenges
[1:17:05] <%Javaa01> Not for practical gameplay
[1:17:07] <%doomerskeletor13> @estuko Wow what a hard decision LUL
[1:17:11] <Visorak6> faster dash recharge is superior to further lunge/longer stagger
[1:17:16] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @Estuko ask for 5 MORE
[1:17:16] <Visorak6> And doesnt require a slot
[1:17:17] <%DesertPenguin> Best Runes: Second Life: Equipment Fiend, Bloodpunch Health
[1:17:24] <Hal10k> There are mp bad choices as far as runes go
[1:17:31] <BlackermanZX> Blood for the BLOOD PUNCH doodNuts
[1:17:33] <%DesertPenguin> It's all playstyle, yea
[1:17:35] <%Javaa01> @Visorak6 Except that the range rune applies to the chainsaw
[1:17:43] <%DesertPenguin> I prefer tanking instead of being speedy
[1:17:44] <%GeneralSCPatton> @estuko Yeah, if he's not willing to go 5 more than your current job, then fuck him
[1:17:48] <+VidulaSaix> monkaS
[1:17:59] <vVAstrAVv> yeah further isng as good since i don't THIIINK eternal has the berzerk instant kill power up that just teleports you from glory kill to glory kill

[1:22:27] <RichochetForce> Yo, fast dash refill is amazing
[1:22:28] <%Javaa01> @WoolieVersus Dash recharge doubles dash recharge rate

[1:25:38] <%GeneralSCPatton> @vidulasaix At least he's not Paige. She might be from the Far Realms, because the mere concept of existing in 3D is anathema to her.
[1:25:38] <%Josef_Stryker> And now you know why Carcasses are the worst
[1:25:40] <%DesertPenguin> Those energy shields are really fucking smart. They always pop up right when you're about to do a glory kill
[1:25:49] <+Estuko> shutguns esp double barrel are so nice...
[1:25:56] <%DesertPenguin> They are area denial monsters
[1:26:05] <raikagelord1> Plasma gun for shields right?
[1:26:05] <%doomerskeletor13> @desertpenguin They seriously did. Happened to me so much
[1:26:08] <megamonmon123> those carcasses are bitches
[1:26:09] <Klarrann3> Shooting the blue shields with the plasma rifle causes a huge explosion that only damages enemies
[1:26:09] <1matheuw> 2 one ups akchualy
[1:26:15] <%Josef_Stryker> Shotguns are always the most satisfying guns to fire in shooters.
[1:26:17] <%DesertPenguin> Yea, I was actually happy they were so useful
[1:26:17] <brovietto> I think the demons were infighting so they softened themselves up for you

[1:26:34] <1matheuw> @Josef_Stryker tell that to DOOM 3
[1:26:38] <%DesertPenguin> You want rockets for this mission *wink wink*
[1:26:47] <+Estuko> anyone play dragons dogma? trying to figure something out and forums are a bu st
[1:26:58] <%GoldeNOVA> Doom(except 3) and FEAR have the best shotguns

[1:29:42] <CeaselessSlick> @GraceTBM you can on this game
[1:29:45] <%DesertPenguin> Basically
[1:29:47] <%Shishi1205> Bidjagamas
[1:29:50] <%dekkitout> What's up with the blue good guy energy cells?
[1:29:52] <megamonmon123> Gg woolie
[1:29:55] <%Javaa01> @GraceTBM It's somewhat limited compared to PC, in that I think it caps out at 110 on Console, but you absolutely can adjust FOV on consoles
[1:30:06] <+Estuko> @no_stro_mo ooohhh its been several years loo, I have the ps3 DD and a DA copy for ps3 when it came put then got it in steam. makes me happy to play it again when I wasnt a dumb bitch
[1:30:08] <ihateyouo> this ones a irch
[1:30:19] <ihateyouo> this one sucks
[1:30:47] <%GraceTBM> in that case, broadening fov might seriously help. I watched a vid of someone murdering the marauder and having a larger fov makes that fight way clearer
[1:30:49] <%DesertPenguin> Almost got it
[1:30:57] <randominternetsurfer> I think you basically need Air Traversal to get this secret. IDK any other way to get it.
[1:30:58] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @huskarl_zap
[1:31:24] <a_mad_dragon> there was another climb wall higher up
[1:31:32] <%J0RD4NPR1M3> jump to green then turn around
[1:31:33] <huskarl_zap> What no memeing mods?
[1:31:37] <%Irridium> if you jump from the other side I think there's a path up there
[1:31:56] <KeystoneA2> go back to the other cylinder thing in the other room then jump left
[1:32:02] <megamonmon123> climb the cylinder
[1:32:09] <%DesertPenguin> Climb the thing
[1:32:18] <%J0RD4NPR1M3> get to it from other side
[1:32:20] <megamonmon123> just follow the climbable on the cylinder
[1:32:24] <esetremendo> so this game is being screwed by id and bethesda?
[1:32:45] <%DesertPenguin> Go back onto the cylinder, and climb around the right side
[1:32:56] <%Javaa01> No just jump around the cylinder while you're on it
[1:33:05] <%J0RD4NPR1M3> go forward then turn around
[1:33:26] <%Shishi1205> up
[1:33:27] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> tbf the platforming can get tricky in later levels
[1:33:28] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:33:35] <%Zebroneath> You can get to it from where you got the floppy disk
[1:34:05] <%Javaa01> Yes, he can
[1:34:13] <%Irridium> you can if you're good enough
[1:34:15] <+segmentedfool> YES YOU CAN
[1:34:18] <%Shishi1205> full circle
[1:34:25] <+waltzqueen> F
[1:34:27] <%SuperKirby24> LUL
[1:34:27] <randominternetsurfer> yes if you have Air Traversal.
[1:34:27] <Louie_Salmon> I remember this section being exceedingly difficult
[1:34:28] <mdkcde> BLIND
[1:34:31] <%DesertPenguin> Just give me the controller, I got this
[1:34:32] <%Javaa01> You don't even need to dash
[1:34:44] <ralphfromdk> Go into the room where you got the other secret, then back through the hole in the wall
[1:34:46] <%J0RD4NPR1M3> go back to the floppy and turn around
[1:34:48] <%Javaa01> Just jump off, double jump around the block and grab the wall
[1:35:05] <+Ether101_Prime> Why do they need to always make it harder then it needs to be?
[1:35:15] <@Solidus_113> because they're gamers
[1:35:17] <%DesertPenguin> Because exploration is fun and having things handed to you isn't?
[1:35:19] <esetremendo> does woolie even take advice from chat?
[1:35:26] <%Camail> no
[1:35:28] <+greenfall> pro gamer strats
[1:35:31] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> sometimes
[1:35:32] <%DensityD> we will control the horizontal, and we will control the vertical
[1:35:33] <+TheBigTaco> brute smarts
[1:35:36] <%GoldeNOVA> Chat is mostly wrong so he shouldn't tbh
[1:35:41] <Brutalyte616> I see you're choosing to do this the hard way.
[1:35:43] <%DensityD> left, or left?
[1:35:44] <mdkcde> the other left
[1:35:45] <$realm_forge> These are legit mindbenders on your first time through
[1:35:45] <%GeneralSCPatton> THE OTHER LEFT
[1:35:56] <KeystoneA2> it's legit good game design when you can hack-fuck your way to locations outside what they want you to do
[1:36:02] <%Camail> he takes advice, not orders

[1:36:44] <%DesertPenguin> Flames are the mastery level
[1:36:46] <raikagelord1> After watching Max, I have learned that not backseating is hard and you have to try and look at it form the players perspective of still wanting to explore and have fun
[1:36:49] <%Gruhunchously> Khaki Demon
[1:36:54] <ralphfromdk> You don't have flames yet, you need to unlock it with the challenge
[1:36:59] <%Shishi1205> Flames are the reward for the mastery

[1:40:35] <+NO_STRO_MO> oh yes
[1:40:35] <%DesertPenguin> keycard
[1:40:35] <%Shishi1205> yes
[1:40:37] <%Irridium> you should try it out see what happens
[1:40:37] <%andrex2311> YES
[1:40:40] <%Javaa01> Punch it in the face
[1:40:44] <+oda_flobunaga> I he wants to try and read the keycard, let him
[1:40:45] <ralphfromdk> Woolie, it was not lore, it was a keycard.
[1:40:46] <+CptnCampy61> You got a keycard not lore
[1:40:48] <@Solidus_113> Punch the bull
[1:40:49] <%Shishi1205> You have killed one with a bloodpunch before @WoolieVersus
[1:40:50] <+TheBigTaco> This is... advanced
[1:41:01] <+TheOneCalledRock> or atleast let the highlight stay until you pass it, rather than when you select it
[1:41:07] <%DensityD> and we still call it a "P I N K Y"
[1:41:12] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> everyday Woolie becomes like Paige
[1:41:27] <$realm_forge> What would pinky bbq brisket taste like?!
[1:41:27] <+TheOneCalledRock> also pinkys are fuck TERRIFYING
[1:41:31] <1matheuw> nuke the pinky
[1:41:33] <vVAstrAVv> honestly the highlight should stay until you close the menu screen
[1:41:34] <+TheOneCalledRock> THEY ARE LIKE BULLS
[1:41:40] <awalr> who would win, a defensive encampment or one pink boi
[1:41:43] <%DesertPenguin> Blood Punch is made for Pinkys
[1:41:45] <%DensityD> bulls, but worse, and demonic powers
[1:41:53] <@Solidus_113> There's also Prowler and Super Shotgun lore you missed
[1:41:54] <%Shishi1205> bloodpunch their assholes
[1:42:05] <%Javaa01> They in fact have MORE damage reduction from the front compared to 2016, where you could still Siege them in the face for an easy kill
[1:42:10] <a_mad_dragon> because the force of the charge increases the force of the punch
[1:42:13] <%Javaa01> But a Blood Punch is a hard counter
[1:42:14] <%J0RD4NPR1M3> give them a prostate exam
[1:42:18] <%Javaa01> So it gets an instant kill
[1:42:19] <%DesertPenguin> It's cool, but I wish the game had more than one "perfect" option for everything Snakes? Use ice bomb Pinkys? Use blood punch Spider: Shoot the weakspot
[1:42:25] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Blood Punch is the NO U of Doom
[1:42:32] <%doomerskeletor13> Hmmmmm
[1:42:35] <RAH001> woolie tried to meathook

[1:57:36] <Ner234> Heck Knight
[1:57:36] <%Irridium> there's also the Prowler
[1:57:42] <%DesertPenguin> When you have to shoot a platform thing, please stop using the super shotgun. Use a gun that has more ammo to begin with like the Plasma Rifle or Heavy Cannon
[1:57:43] <+Sleepy_Puma> man it would be cool if they sold those toy pick ups as real toys
[1:57:53] <Darren716> Why does Woolie love using the SSG to shoot buttons? Its just burning ammo LUL
[1:57:59] <%Irridium> wait his guntank buttom is called a Sled? that's hilarious
[1:57:59] <%DesertPenguin> It hurts my OCD
[1:57:59] <venomfury86> skipping leg day
[1:58:08] <%DesertPenguin> Use the heavy cannon for button shooting
[1:58:08] <vVAstrAVv> i hate them calling it a sled
[1:58:17] <%DesertPenguin> What would you call it?
[1:58:19] <+maenos2> I mean it is basically a sled
[1:58:23] <%GraceTBM> woolz doesn't like switching weapons a ton since it needs the wheel, sohe just uses whatever's equipped
[1:58:23] <DedlokPM> It literally is a sled though
[1:58:27] <$realm_forge> Popping the shield is also fun
[1:58:28] <%DensityD> I didn't just skip over leg day, I Hovered right over the top.
[1:58:28] <%DesertPenguin> A hover-platform?
[1:58:29] <hassanico2> wow what a shitty lockon it has LUL
[1:58:30] <%GeneralSCPatton> GRAV SLED
[1:58:38] <%DesertPenguin> DOOM SLED
[1:58:38] <hassanico2> Can't even handle double jumping Doom Marines
[1:58:40] <$realm_forge> Shoot it until it dies
[1:58:43] <%Irridium> it just gives me thoughts of them sliding down the hills, arms in the air, going "weeee!"
[1:58:47] <%trustycoyote> @Sleepy_Puma Completely agree. They are walking away from a ton of money. As long as they aren't Funko figures and look like they do in game.

[2:01:24] <zocano> Don’t worry about the shield, just focus the treads
[2:01:26] <+adimcorner> this entire game is filled with toys
[2:01:31] <%DesertPenguin> Small enemies are around SPECIFICALLY for ammo/health/armor
[2:01:35] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[2:01:39] <%J0RD4NPR1M3> rockets
[2:01:39] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:01:39] <Louie_Salmon> Gotta get the bloodpunch, pulls out the single most powerful weapon in the arsenal
[2:01:45] <%BallerSwagBro9k> THE BACK DOWN
[2:01:52] <hassanico2> Missile Warning on the Slayer's HUD, nice!
[2:02:03] <+Ether101_Prime> Woolie's getting his ass kicked by a toy.
[2:02:03] <%DensityD> is this normal or ultra-violence?
[2:02:06] <%DesertPenguin> Woolie, you have to hit them
[2:02:07] <%doomerskeletor13> Running away is a viable strategy
[2:02:12] <%Irridium> normal
[2:02:17] <%DensityD> ty
[2:02:20] <%DesertPenguin> ONE MORE HIT
[2:02:28] <+MeMillionthDollar> LUL Just wait

[2:02:47] <TigerClaws12> YA HATE TO SEE IT LUL
[2:02:50] <@Solidus_113> rookie mistake
[2:02:50] <%Lightwolfe> peak baka
[2:02:52] <%GeneralSCPatton> Did that glory kill pop post-mortem?
[2:02:54] <dante_9x> vision tunnel af
[2:02:57] <%SuperKirby24> does he not have full auto on his shotgun?
[2:03:02] <hassanico2> Just kill it!
[2:03:02] <%DesertPenguin> Don't worry about the challenges right now
[2:03:02] <zocano> You can focus the treads without dealing with the shield
[2:03:04] <%DensityD> blood punch is ONE tactic of several
[2:03:07] <%DensityD> "Yeah sure"
[2:03:12] <%Josef_Stryker> PHASE 2 FUCKERS
[2:03:12] <memes_are_cancer> Sure kappa
[2:03:15] <VJdarkworld> almost dead :)
[2:03:19] <+adimcorner> it's got two bars
[2:03:20] <%SuperKirby24> there we go
[2:03:21] <hassanico2> CRITICAL DAMAGE
[2:03:23] <%Solidnick18> YEYE
[2:03:24] <$realm_forge> Use heat blast on shields too
[2:03:24] <%DesertPenguin> Lock On Missiles are your friend
[2:03:28] <Th3rd3> use ukemi Woolie!! PunOko
[2:03:32] <%Gruhunchously> Now the REAL fight begins
[2:03:34] <%DensityD> it needs a single bar that extends off the screen
[2:03:35] <+kewlmyc> this is going to be fun
[2:03:37] <DedlokPM> I love how the Doom Hunter sounds like Soundwave
[2:03:37] <%Josef_Stryker> You got a hook Woolie. Use it
[2:03:39] <Soulglove> it felt pretty good when I beat this on first try without using lives on UV
[2:03:44] <+MeMillionthDollar> Yea heat blast helps a ton
[2:03:45] <awalr> *blocks ur path*
[2:03:46] <%DesertPenguin> you have to hit them
[2:03:49] <%GraceTBM> Stop using the Super Shotgun on guys you want to glory kill
[2:03:53] <%HowIPendragon> Big panics
[2:03:55] <%DensityD> Jebaited 2 extra lives Jebaited
[2:03:55] <huskarl_zap> Wrong opinion got bullied
[2:03:55] <+VidulaSaix> ^
[2:03:55] <venomfury86> you also have flame belch
[2:03:55] <+oda_flobunaga> @WoolieVersus For your future consideration, the Metro series.
[2:03:56] <+Sleepy_Puma> This gets nutty lol
[2:03:56] <+gustavozxd> gotta respect peoople who play this with a controller cause fucking how
[2:03:59] <huskarl_zap> P'd on
[2:04:00] <+Ether101_Prime> "It's a toy." LUL
[2:04:03] <+Sleepy_Puma> Flame belch for shields
[2:04:03] <%paladinstarbuster> FULL AUTO ON SLED
[2:04:06] <@Solidus_113> you don't need to take down the shield to hurt the sled
[2:04:07] <RunningNGunning> Do everything all the time everytime
[2:04:07] <%GraceTBM> chainsaw for 20 ez health
[2:04:08] <%Lightwolfe> Poorly like this
[2:04:08] <VJdarkworld> just a toy :)
[2:04:10] <%DesertPenguin> Heavy Cannon for glory kills
[2:04:10] <KeystoneA2> focus on the sled
[2:04:10] <%Lightwolfe> is how they play
[2:04:11] <%DensityD> weakness is strength
[2:04:14] <zocano> Don’t worry about the shield, you can damage the sled with the shield still up
[2:04:14] <%Gruhunchously> Big sheilds
[2:04:15] <BlackermanZX> too brutal
[2:04:16] <vVAstrAVv> cycle your grenades too woolie
[2:04:18] <%GeneralSCPatton> How long until flame hook?
[2:04:20] <%FuqBoiSlim> Controller boys we out here
[2:04:21] <mdkcde> You DUNNO Wut U MESSIN WITH
[2:04:21] <randominternetsurfer> you have no idea.
[2:04:22] <$realm_forge> Round 2 bay beee!
[2:04:22] <%DensityD> weakness gives way to strong overkill
[2:04:25] <VorpalFork> Woolie dont bother attacking the shield, just go for the sled
[2:04:27] <Klarrann3> you don't HAVE to break the shield first. You can just focus all your shots on the sled
[2:04:30] <%DesertPenguin> Plasma Rifle the shields off, then lock-on missles for the win
[2:04:36] <+CptnCampy61> ICE BOMBS
[2:04:36] <%Javaa01> @GeneralSCPatton 45 kills or something like that
[2:04:39] <Louie_Salmon> You can just punch the sled, it's not covered by the shield
[2:04:40] <%Lightwolfe> Ice/Normal Grenade do not share cooldown please
[2:04:42] <%rsb2025> use your plasma wave when close
[2:04:44] <dante_9x> heat blast on heavy not fodder
[2:04:50] <%DensityD> get the tail cut and carve
[2:04:50] <a_mad_dragon> AIM AT THE TREADS
[2:04:54] <%DesertPenguin> Is anyone counting how many times Woolie dies?
[2:05:01] <cipher758> fuck
[2:05:05] <%DensityD> lrn the dmg rotation
[2:05:11] <%SuperKirby24> bonk
[2:05:12] <huskarl_zap> Destroyer vs woolie is a 10 zero match up
[2:05:13] <+gustavozxd> @DesertPenguin do extra lives count?
[2:05:16] <VJdarkworld> yeh i didn't realize the sled could still be hurt even when the shield is up till after the fight lol oops
[2:05:17] <%DesertPenguin> No
[2:05:21] <%DesertPenguin> Full death screens
[2:05:24] <%Lightwolfe> Then change manually ya dingus
[2:05:24] <%ChoculaUltra> grasp the net firmly
[2:05:28] <$realm_forge> Twist his dick!
[2:05:28] <Louie_Salmon> Butterfly kisses with your gun
[2:05:29] <BlackermanZX> gently kill it
[2:05:36] <%DesertPenguin> MISSILES
[2:05:39] <1matheuw> NICE
[2:05:43] <%FuqBoiSlim> Gently slaughter the possessed
[2:05:45] <$realm_forge> Give EM the ol dick twist!
[2:05:48] <+Ether101_Prime> I don't get why their making this so hard.
[2:05:51] <+Vibe__Lord> !motivated
[2:05:52] <@Moobot> 1179 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[2:05:54] <ihateyouo> CHAINSAW
[2:05:55] <%SuperKirby24> TWISR THE DICK
[2:05:56] <venomfury86> this might be my second favorite boss music
[2:05:57] <KillMyPast> CHAINSAW
[2:06:00] <%Gruhunchously> Gently caress them then pull their heads off
[2:06:05] <%DesertPenguin> To anyone that's already beaten this level, we're in for such a great moment after this boss battle. I can't wait for their reaction!
[2:06:07] <%DensityD> the ol dick twitst
[2:06:08] <Louie_Salmon> The bloodpunch is just for the sled
[2:06:12] <+Sleepy_Puma> Rotate nades
[2:06:18] <$realm_forge> @ether101_prime it’s their first time through
[2:06:20] <hassanico2> Good use of flame belch there
[2:06:23] <%Asuterisuku> Oh! I didn't think you'd be at the boss fight already. Good luck!
[2:06:28] <%DesertPenguin> Plasma Rifle is not powerful against flesh
[2:06:38] <+gustavozxd> anyone in chat played this with a controller?
[2:06:43] <%DesertPenguin> This is hard to watch. He hwas more than enough health to just finish off the boss
[2:06:51] <+maenos2> uh music?
[2:06:54] <%GraceTBM> i love how the SSG just deletes that shield fucko off the map at short range
[2:06:55] <+jepupu> Punch is only strong against the sled
[2:06:55] <%DesertPenguin> Just use the rocket launcher jeez
[2:06:56] <hassanico2> oh my god the way he spun LUL
[2:06:57] <1matheuw> dam the micro missles melt the dude
[2:07:03] <1matheuw> !music at risk"
[2:07:04] <+sir_louis> took too long LUL
[2:07:04] <haisho> yeah music tends to bug here
[2:07:05] <Klarrann3> @gustavozxd yeah, I played on nightmare with a controller
[2:07:05] <TigerClaws12> LUL
[2:07:06] <Louie_Salmon> No longer hype
[2:07:07] <%DensityD> you are no longer SSStyling
[2:07:07] <StarvingPenguinGod> took to long LUL
[2:07:07] <%ChoculaUltra> TURN UP MY SNARE
[2:07:07] <zocano> He doesn’t know the boss is fully vulnerable
[2:07:07] <warmnoid> @gustavozxd i did on UV
[2:07:08] <%DesertPenguin> You took too long
[2:07:09] <@Solidus_113> Music is tired of your bad play
[2:07:11] <Clowns> Bethesid
[2:07:11] <$realm_forge> Woolie’s starting to see the matrix code....he’s beginning to believe
[2:07:13] <Ner234> *rock music stops*
[2:07:16] <KillMyPast> You dont deserve the music :)
[2:07:18] <+NO_STRO_MO> Thanks Bethesda
[2:07:18] <%HowIPendragon> This fight gets buggy. Had to fucking reload it my first time.
[2:07:21] <%SuperKirby24> license expired Kappa
[2:07:22] <RunningNGunning> Mick is tired of your shit Woolie
[2:07:23] <+leviting> you took so long the song ended
[2:07:24] <Dingo_Eejit> @gustavozxd - yeah, it's awful
[2:07:26] <%rsb2025> mick was not impressed
[2:07:26] <%Gruhunchously> Where did the music go?
[2:07:27] <Darren716> Its like DMC V, you only get music by playing well
[2:07:29] <%GraceTBM> you were just doing so little that they dynamic track dropped to nothing for a bit
[2:07:29] <1matheuw> *death metal starts*
[2:07:30] <%BallerSwagBro9k> FYI the Lock On RPG will melt his 2nd HP BAR
[2:07:31] <VJdarkworld> that was the sound of denuvo
[2:07:32] <Sleepsie_> "Fight faster, chump" -Id
[2:07:32] <%DesertPenguin> Rocket Launcher is your friend
[2:07:36] <%Irridium> he keeps pushing you away
[2:07:37] <+LoganWulfric> Wouldn't have happened if they let Mick mix it
[2:07:42] <Louie_Salmon> Getting out-ranged
[2:07:42] <+Sleepy_Puma> He doin keep out
[2:07:42] <%Asuterisuku> Without the sled he can't make a shield.
[2:07:47] <+Ether101_Prime> @realm_forge I know but their doing things the game shows and tells them not to do.
[2:07:47] <+oda_flobunaga> tied to a style meter
[2:07:48] <huskarl_zap> woolieSMUG 0:10 match up
[2:07:49] <Visorak6> woolie whiffing harder than ever
[2:07:49] <TigerClaws12> LUL
[2:07:49] <%Gruhunchously> Mick wouldn't keep his deadlines
[2:07:51] <Louie_Salmon> Trying to light punch a spear user
[2:07:53] <+MeMillionthDollar> LUL
[2:07:53] <%GraceTBM> It's tough to land the blood punch on his second form
[2:07:55] <%FuqBoiSlim> The music stopped cuz u were bad just like DMC5 LUL
[2:07:55] <+jepupu> Punches do extra to the sled. It's whatever against the top part
[2:07:55] <@Solidus_113> in-game has nothing to do with OST
[2:07:56] <venomfury86> there you go
[2:07:56] <$realm_forge> Bust out those rockets!
[2:07:57] <raveous> melee not recommended in this phase, his melee attacks do a lot of damage to you
[2:07:58] <@Solidus_113> relax
[2:07:59] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @LoganWulfric Mick did mix this
[2:08:09] <KillMyPast> Just hit the boss
[2:08:11] <+gustavozxd> @Dingo_Eejit first time i played 2016 I didn't even like the game cause it was on ps4 LUL but I guess there's a lot of people who don't mind
[2:08:12] <%mitchteck> Use rockets on phase 2
[2:08:12] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @LoganWulfric all the in-game music was mixed by Mick
[2:08:14] <%DensityD> GG

[2:10:11] <+Reverend_Roscoe> YOU THOUGHT, MOTHAFUCKA
[2:10:13] <thunderborn32> why isn't he shooting it with anything but the pulse rifle
[2:10:16] <%DesertPenguin> Plasma Rifle the shields, then rocket launcher the rest. It only take 5 or so rockets
[2:10:17] <%GraceTBM> you're totally learning, keep it up
[2:10:17] <%Solidnick18> It's getting realer
[2:10:17] <+gustavozxd> this game has like 1 actual boss fight that i remember of at least
[2:10:19] <raveous> imagine starting over from the first one
[2:10:20] <huskarl_zap> Wrong opinion rekted
[2:10:21] <+Sleepy_Puma> Gotta keep running, good job man
[2:10:21] <%Lightwolfe> then stop panicing
[2:10:23] <BlackermanZX> @WoolieVersus Your grenades are on different cooldown
[2:10:24] <Th3rd3> RPG will be the downfall for Woolie TPFufun
[2:10:24] <%Lightwolfe> durr
[2:10:29] <%GraceTBM> 3 major boss fights
[2:10:31] <%Javaa01> There's no way to reduce self damage in this game
[2:10:35] <randominternetsurfer> F
[2:10:35] <$realm_forge> Welcome to the thunderdome
[2:10:40] <%DesertPenguin> YOu need to switch weapons
[2:10:41] <thunderborn32> dude stop using the pulse rifle on him
[2:10:45] <%Gruhunchously> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[2:10:45] <venomfury86> the game is surely earning its name
[2:10:47] <%DesertPenguin> The plasma doesn't do as much damage against them after the shield is off
[2:10:50] <%GraceTBM> the way to reduce self damage is don't shoot the rocket at your feet
[2:10:51] <%DensityD> PURGE THE HERETIC
[2:10:52] <%DesertPenguin> It's frustrating at this point
[2:10:52] <randominternetsurfer> @javaa01 the Rocket Launcher is the only weapons that self damages.
[2:10:53] <%Solidnick18> SMASH THE HERETIC
[2:10:59] <dante_9x> more of that please
[2:11:01] <DedlokPM> @thunderborn32 because he is hyper focused on the " take down the shield for more damage" aspect
[2:11:05] <%DesertPenguin> You'd think being a gamer he could pick up on the fact that he's shooting so much and doing so little damage
[2:11:07] <%GraceTBM> i'm so glad grenades don't self damage in this one
[2:11:09] <%DensityD> chainsaw for ammo
[2:11:16] <1matheuw> this isnt mild doom or sometimes doom
[2:11:17] <%FuqBoiSlim> here's doing his best chat
[2:11:20] <dante_9x> heat balst please
[2:11:22] <+jepupu> You don't need to take the shields down to punch the sled
[2:11:25] <%DesertPenguin> Heat blast
[2:11:27] <1matheuw> this is doom eternal
[2:11:30] <Bennett_Fracture> i cheated the system some how...
[2:11:36] <%Gruhunchously> The Prophet of Truth is commenting in the backround
[2:11:36] <%Kriss1827> remember he doesnt play many pfs's
[2:11:37] <Iwashi94> this is getting out of hand
[2:11:38] <%DensityD> man I sure wish I had a BFG
[2:11:41] <%DesertPenguin> @Jepupu but it's easier to have a bigger target than trying to focus on one spot
[2:11:45] <+greenfall> you can go straight for the sled and skip the armor phase
[2:11:50] <Bennett_Fracture> i'm weight lifting in between patrols...
[2:11:56] <+VidulaSaix> @Kriss1827 I feel like thats become a bit of an excuse at this point. Hes been playing quite a lot recently
[2:12:00] <pixel_river> SourPls
[2:12:01] <MayorRev> SourPls
[2:12:01] <%DensityD> point and click, until it is done
[2:12:02] <@Solidus_113> SourPls
[2:12:03] <Bennett_Fracture> no more skipping legs day...
[2:12:04] <%DesertPenguin> And he played Doom 2016. He knows how to play
[2:12:05] <%GraceTBM> is that the same VA as Truth, or just similar?
[2:12:08] <+AWanderingKenku> I usually just full-auto shotgunned the treads to start.
[2:12:11] <%Irridium> you don't HAVE to punch the sled shooting it works just fine. Especially rockets
[2:12:13] <+gustavozxd> i don't like using the bfg cause i want to kill enemies myself LUL
[2:12:17] <%DesertPenguin> use your rocket launcher
[2:12:27] <$realm_forge> Remember what Denzel Washington said in Remember the Titans. Mobile. Agile. Hostile!
[2:12:28] <%SuperKirby24> Unrelated, but does anyone else have this bug where encounters dont get marked as completed even if they get done? Kappa
[2:12:33] <%Lightwolfe> I dont trust Woolie with the launcher
[2:12:35] <%Solidnick18> keep moving
[2:12:36] <%GraceTBM> BFG is practically mandatory in the last level's pre boss fights
[2:12:42] <VJdarkworld> ! CRITICAL DAMAGE !
[2:12:53] <%Gruhunchously> VITAL SIGNS ARE DROPPING
[2:12:54] <%DensityD> just build, lol
[2:12:57] <heart_ablaze> @superkirby24 yup, had that issue in one level
[2:12:58] <%Solidnick18> no time to stand still
[2:13:05] <+AWanderingKenku> ! COCK INJURED !
[2:13:07] <%Asuterisuku> I find it hilarious how any one of these bosses is much, much harder than the bosses of DOOM 1 and 2.
[2:13:14] <%Kriss1827> @vidulasaix kind of true but dont expect someone to master a genre in only months? hopefully that makes sense
[2:13:23] <dante_9x> yo look on ???
[2:13:23] <%Solidnick18> one more
[2:13:24] <Th3rd3> nice nice
[2:13:24] <huskarl_zap> Centaurs vs Woolie is 8:2 match up
[2:13:25] <+gustavozxd> sick glory kill
[2:13:29] <%FuqBoiSlim> UZE THE LOCK ON END THIS MAN
[2:13:29] <+Reverend_Roscoe> S E V E R E. L A C E R A T I O N S. D E T E C T E D.
[2:13:34] <%GraceTBM> this has so many more mechanics than OG Doom, there's no way they could have made as tough or complicated a boss
[2:13:47] <randominternetsurfer> USE LOCK ON ROCKETS
[2:13:47] <+gustavozxd> my fav glory kill is the one where you grab the guy's buster arm and make him shoot himself
[2:13:55] <%SuperKirby24> @heart_ablaze feelsbadman I wanna 100% it but it happened to me twice Kappa
[2:13:57] <%DesertPenguin> Switch to rockets when the shield is down
[2:14:01] <RunningNGunning> Woolie's doing a lot better than I was expecting with this fight tbh
[2:14:01] <%GraceTBM> yeah, gustavo, that one's on of the best
[2:14:02] <%Gruhunchously> Big boys
[2:14:04] <snakest3alth> STOP GETTING CLOSE TO IT
[2:14:08] <%Asuterisuku> To kill the Hunter, shoot it until it dies.
[2:14:12] <heart_ablaze> @superkirby24 I feel you
[2:14:13] <+tuchpi> PogChamp
[2:14:13] <%DesertPenguin> Took too long and shield is back up
[2:14:22] <%GraceTBM> woolz is totally learning and doing a pretty decent job at maintaining his stack and ammo
[2:14:24] <+AWanderingKenku> You're supposed to shoot it until it dies.
[2:14:24] <+Reverend_Roscoe> SHOOT THE SLED
[2:14:25] <+gustavozxd> @GraceTBM problem is, idk how to get that
[2:14:30] <Th3rd3> this is it!!
[2:14:33] <thunderborn32> you know if he would just pause and read the enemy profile he would be much more proficient at fighting them
[2:14:36] <huskarl_zap> REKT
[2:14:38] <+gustavozxd> idk if there's a specific way to do it
[2:14:41] <RunningNGunning> monkaS
[2:14:42] <@Solidus_113> monkaS
[2:14:44] <%GraceTBM> gustav prolly aim at the buster cannon arm when you initiate

[2:14:47] <$realm_forge> Hell yeah bloodbourne that health
[2:14:52] <Th3rd3> oh no

[2:16:26] <n3ls1s> nope it's was easy mode
[2:16:31] <%GraceTBM> i totally slept on auto shotty until post game, it's incredible
[2:16:49] <+greenfall> Super shotgun, woolie
[2:16:53] <%Asuterisuku> The first mission is designed to show you how both shotgun mods are good.
[2:17:00] <%GraceTBM> wolfe, that might actually get him in the habit of checking his ammo count if he keeps clicking on a dry gun
[2:17:13] <thunderborn32> @GraceTBM yeah allot of people, and almost every streamer went for the nade but auto shotty melts
[2:17:19] <dante_9x> heat blast is close range
[2:17:25] <%Gruhunchously> Slow mo incoming rocket
[2:17:29] <%Asuterisuku> Once the turret's out of the way, autoshotty melts arachnotrons and Hellknights.
[2:17:32] <%GraceTBM> @Asuterisuku absolutely, but it's very easy to just get used to swapping to combat shotty for the weakpoint grenades
[2:17:34] <gunsrlove> All this plasma wastage Kappa
[2:17:35] <awalr> i feel like they should have done the doom 1993 thing of showing all the ammo types on the base hud
[2:17:37] <$realm_forge> I love that the heat blast bypasses chunks and just turns enemies into blood clouds
[2:17:39] <%Gruhunchously> BLOOD LOSS DETECTED
[2:17:45] <BlackermanZX> Woolie really needs that faster dash reload fundamental upgrade
[2:17:47] <%GraceTBM> awalr that's a great idea
[2:17:55] <J87_fox> lock on rockets as soon as he is in his 2nd phase

[2:18:56] <%Asuterisuku> They took the Summoner from the last game and split it into two different demons here.
[2:19:04] <%Asuterisuku> The Prowler, and something else that I'm not allowed to tell you.
[2:19:04] <%paladinstarbuster> YOU DONT NEED BLOOD PUNCH
[2:19:12] <+VidulaSaix> Almsot did it again LUL
[2:19:23] <$realm_forge> Shit I wanna do another play through of this now
[2:19:25] <%GraceTBM> the prowler is almost awful, but SSG deletes him, which is very satisfying
[2:19:29] <Who_lio42> chainsaw can still get you health
[2:19:32] <%SuperKirby24> tfw no flame belch Kappa

[2:19:49] <%Asuterisuku> There are a lot of demons that are almost awful, but _ deletes them.
[2:19:49] <%Lightwolfe> he doesnt realize
[2:19:49] <%Gruhunchously> YOU HAVE TO KILL FAST, AND BULLETS TOO SLOW
[2:19:52] <%Irridium> gotta be disciplined when fishing for glory kills with the plasma rifle
[2:19:53] <VJdarkworld> do combo
[2:19:53] <gunsrlove> SSG deletes both phases of Doom Hunter too LUL
[2:19:56] <dante_9x> nice
[2:19:59] <%DensityD> doesn't he have some type of grenade, or has he swapped for belch and ice?
[2:20:02] <%DesertPenguin> Triple Rocket does 1/3 of his health
[2:20:05] <%DesertPenguin> see how useful that is?
[2:20:06] <Batmagoo> that was nice
[2:20:16] <%DesertPenguin> Lock on, shoot, set it and forget it
[2:20:16] <%GraceTBM> tbh i understand why he doesn't flame then chainsaw, it doesn't /feel/ like it gives both
[2:20:22] <%Asuterisuku> There is a certain demon type that always eats a BFG when I see it though.

[2:25:31] <%GraceTBM> honestly, compared to the gauss cannon, the ballista is underwhelming. However, that's cause the gauss cannon was busted op as fuck

[2:26:09] <randominternetsurfer> @woolieversus Nah, she needs human souls for Argent Energy. She needs Argent Energy for her world.
[2:26:13] <Ultimatefool> Not-as-powerful-but-still-fucking-rad Gauss
[2:26:14] <%GraceTBM> the destroyer blade has such a high skill ceiling that i still haven't gotten the hang of
[2:26:15] <%DensityD> BLACK IRON TARKUS
[2:26:20] <Kalinflip> hell priest were once Sentinel high priest
[2:26:24] <@Solidus_113> WEAPON MOD
[2:26:25] <+greenfall> debuffed gauss
[2:26:25] <+gustavozxd> I prefer the ballista design cause it feels more dirty, i miss the op shit from the gauss tho calebKek
[2:26:32] <hassanico2> Put the cookie down!
[2:26:33] <%Asuterisuku> It lets you rocket jump like the gauss cannon, too.
[2:26:34] <gunsrlove> Dash
[2:26:36] <gunsrlove> Quick Dash
[2:26:39] <%Javaa01> Dash Recharge
[2:26:42] <%GraceTBM> the ballista is this cool ass weird tech gun, i love it
[2:26:44] <%doomerskeletor13> “10 days and 10 nights” is some biblical ass terminology
[2:26:45] <%GraceTBM> ot
[2:26:46] <%DensityD> do what you want
[2:26:49] <venomfury86> @gustavozxd same
[2:26:59] <%BallerSwagBro9k> DO NO SELF DAMAGE
[2:26:59] <Them00n> Fundamentals are fundamental.
[2:27:00] <%GraceTBM> dash cooldown?
[2:27:00] <%Lightwolfe> they dont share cooldown
[2:27:01] <hassanico2> Ice is nice
[2:27:02] <Darren716> Why not?
[2:27:03] <+gustavozxd> ice is very strong
[2:27:05] <Darren716> USE BOTH
[2:27:06] <+marumariball> the grenades are on separate cooldowns
[2:27:06] <megamonmon123> you should use it
[2:27:09] <thunderborn32> but frag and ice dont share a cooldown you can use both
[2:27:10] <%Chichen> @WoolieVersus Ice and Frag don't share Cooldown
[2:27:12] <dante_9x> which is wrong move
[2:27:12] <BlackermanZX> @WoolieVersus your frag and ice are on separate cooldown
[2:27:13] <megamonmon123> they have different cooldowns
[2:27:13] <%Asuterisuku> There's nothing stopping you from using both.
[2:27:14] <Cybermancer> they don't share cooldowns. use both
[2:27:15] <Louie_Salmon> Frag is on a separate cooldown, there is no reason to not use both
[2:27:15] <%Javaa01> Nades are NOT on the same cooldown as Ice
[2:27:15] <Klarrann3> Grenades don't share a cooldown
[2:27:16] <%GraceTBM> double frag is soooo good
[2:27:17] <%Lightwolfe> Grenades are on seperate cooldowns
[2:27:17] <megaman_sentinel> ice then frag
[2:27:19] <%Irridium> ice then switch to frag = BIG HEALTH
[2:27:23] <turbofolk> Use all your tools
[2:27:23] <Cabbs_1> feels like every other suit upgrade is better used in conjunction with dash increase. and the guns. and melee.
[2:27:28] <thunderborn32> @WoolieVersus grenades dont share cooldown
[2:27:32] <%Lightwolfe> then do that damnit
[2:27:36] <%Chichen> NOPE
[2:27:37] <turbofolk> big breaths rooms
[2:27:37] <@Solidus_113> they don't
[2:27:38] <LeviathanNexus> Nope
[2:27:38] <%Chichen> THEY DONT
[2:27:38] <awalr> Nope
[2:27:38] <%Irridium> nope
[2:27:38] <%tearfuldevil> they dont
[2:27:39] <%Lightwolfe> they dont
[2:27:39] <BlackermanZX> THEY DONT
[2:27:39] <+marumariball> they dont
[2:27:39] <Louie_Salmon> No
[2:27:39] <Ner234> NO
[2:27:39] <megaman_sentinel> no
[2:27:40] <%Asuterisuku> They do NOT share a cooldown.
[2:27:40] <%Lightwolfe> NO
[2:27:40] <+YabbaTroll> they dont
[2:27:40] <+TheOneCalledRock> THEY DO NOT
[2:27:41] <%Irridium> they don't
[2:27:41] <megamonmon123> NO
[2:27:42] <Darren716> THEY DONT
[2:27:42] <Pantera_Productions> They do not
[2:27:42] <+TheBigTaco> no
[2:27:42] <%Javaa01> THEY DO NOT SHARE A COOLDOWN
[2:27:42] <sniffy77> one of the frag upgrades is 2 grenades
[2:27:42] <%Zebroneath> Grenades really good for a quick stun on heavy demons
[2:27:42] <heart_ablaze> they don't
[2:27:42] <%J0RD4NPR1M3> they do not
[2:27:43] <AWalkingErection> they dont
[2:27:44] <%WanderingSwordsman> they don't
[2:27:44] <megamonmon123> They dont
[2:27:45] <%GraceTBM> no different cooldown
[2:27:45] <%doomerskeletor13> They don’t
[2:27:46] <%Lightwolfe> ya dingus
[2:27:48] <awalr> LUL
[2:27:49] <RogueMinja> They don't.
[2:27:52] <Darren716> We've been telling you this for 3 streams LUL
[2:27:53] <venomfury86> they don't
[2:27:53] <%mitchteck> Change gernade switch left stick click
[2:27:54] <+VidulaSaix> Yeah we've been trying to tell you that lol
[2:27:54] <thunderborn32> no they didnt
[2:28:03] <trickybird> and with rune, reduces ice cd if you use frag
[2:28:06] <%Irridium> yeah no they changed that thankfully
[2:28:07] <daemonazaezal> frag and ice dont
[2:28:08] <%GraceTBM> it would be cool if you could map both grenades to different buttons
[2:28:09] <zocano> I wish you could assign them both to two different buttons
[2:28:09] <phantalime> did they in 16?
[2:28:09] <megamonmon123> yeah naw they changed that
[2:28:14] <daemonazaezal> they dont have the same cool down
[2:28:15] <%Chichen> the moment you stop playing it like 16 the better you get
[2:28:17] <+TheOneCalledRock> @DFireCreations yeo
[2:28:17] <zocano> Too much hassle to swap between them
[2:28:18] <BlackermanZX> You can basically rotate between cooldowns
[2:28:19] <daemonazaezal> use one then the other
[2:28:20] <+TheOneCalledRock> yep*(
[2:28:21] <@Solidus_113> Ice > belch > frag for big combo
[2:28:22] <daemonazaezal> ice then frag
[2:28:26] <KeystoneA2> 2016's nades were supremely "meh"
[2:28:27] <awalr> Free upgrades PogChamp
[2:28:30] <thunderborn32> oh in 16 yeah i they did
[2:28:38] <turbofolk> Stop thinking in meta 2016 WIRE YOUR BRAIN TO ETERNAL BABY
[2:28:44] <+Reverend_Roscoe> They're called Pressumptions woolie
[2:28:45] <awalr> same thing with muscle memory, it can really fuck you up
[2:28:47] <%GeneralSCPatton> There is a red thing in the stained glass in the ballista room. Shoot it for the most obscure secret.
[2:28:48] <megamonmon123> its fiiiiine woolie
[2:28:50] <%GraceTBM> did anybody routinely switch their grenade type in 2016? i just used grenade til health siphon, then went back to grenade post game
[2:28:51] <@Solidus_113> you'll want that protection for the next level
[2:28:55] <Louie_Salmon> I mean, it literally changed so you're fine
[2:29:05] <%Chichen> ye ye
[2:29:07] <%Chichen> dash refill
[2:29:07] <BlackermanZX> dash refil is useful
[2:29:08] <%GraceTBM> @GeneralSCPatton That's not til the second to last level i think
[2:29:13] <turbofolk> i forget grenades exist in 2016
[2:29:18] <%doomerskeletor13> The next mission is a doozy
[2:29:20] <ralphfromdk> GeneralSCPatton That only unlocks later after you get the "other" power source, right?
[2:29:23] <%GraceTBM> i did too turbo
[2:29:24] <%Javaa01> @GraceTBM No one even bothered using equipment in 2016 cause they all kinda sucked, well except for Siphon maybe
[2:29:27] <@Solidus_113> GO GET A WEAPON MOD WITH BATTERIES
[2:29:28] <%GeneralSCPatton> @ralphfromdk Idk
[2:29:30] <%GraceTBM> yeah ralph
[2:29:30] <%Asuterisuku> That was the limit of 2016 as a whole; people sticked with the things they liked because they never ran out of ammo anyway.
[2:29:30] <+gustavozxd> i barely used grenades in general in 16
[2:29:30] <%Solidnick18> you can get that right now
[2:29:34] <+TheOneCalledRock> @GraceTBM I know i didn't basic grenades did the job, no reason to switched
[2:29:40] <BlackermanZX> you dash into a glory then dash aeay from it
[2:29:54] <%Asuterisuku> You can buy three things with batteries!
[2:29:54] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:29:57] <+TheOneCalledRock> and yeah basic grenades were butt in 2016
[2:29:59] <%GraceTBM> grenades were good for dropping before glory kill invincibility, but your weapons were so good in 2016 that you didn't need to bother
[2:30:08] <%doomerskeletor13> Plasma has high dps
[2:30:24] <thunderborn32> i haven't seen the past 2 hours but from what i saw in that arena fight he needs to use shotty more
[2:30:27] <@Solidus_113> SAVE IT
[2:30:28] <@Solidus_113> WAIT
[2:30:29] <%Irridium> you know you can unlock some upgrades with the batteries
[2:30:31] <%Asuterisuku> This game does a much better job of encouraging you to use all your tools than 2016.
[2:30:31] <Darren716> WAIT
[2:30:32] <%paladinstarbuster> WAIT
[2:30:35] <Darren716> GET A NEW MOD
[2:30:35] <+TheOneCalledRock> make sure you get the flaming meat hook
[2:30:36] <%Javaa01> SAVE THE POINTS
[2:30:38] <%doomerskeletor13> woolieOMG
[2:30:41] <@Solidus_113> BALLISTA
[2:30:42] <%paladinstarbuster> BALLISTA
[2:30:45] <+TheOneCalledRock> BOLLISTA
[2:30:45] <1matheuw> the gauss
[2:30:46] <%GeneralSCPatton> BALLISTA MOD
[2:30:46] <%Javaa01> FOR A WEAPON MOD
[2:30:46] <Darren716> BALLISTA
[2:30:50] <@Solidus_113> DESTROYER BLADE
[2:30:51] <%Asuterisuku> For the Chaingun.
[2:30:54] <venomfury86> BALLISTA
[2:31:00] <@Solidus_113> DESTROYER BLADE
[2:31:02] <%GraceTBM> i didn't find myself using the plasma gun on anything except enemies weak to it after i got the chaingun
[2:31:02] <SomeAsianDood> It is like siege mode
[2:31:05] <Visorak6> DESTROYER
[2:31:09] <%Solidnick18> Get the upgrades in the fortress
[2:31:09] <+YabbaTroll> yo destroyer blade tho
[2:31:14] <%paladinstarbuster> Woolie doesnt even remember his bayby
[2:31:15] <%GraceTBM> arbalest is a much better starter mod
[2:31:18] <%Shishi1205> Get an upgrade in the base
[2:31:19] <BlackermanZX> go get the upgrades in the fortress you have the batteries
[2:31:21] <FrostedZaibatsu> Didnt know this was ChatVersus
[2:31:21] <Visorak6> You can go unlock a room for destroyer blade right now
[2:31:22] <%Javaa01> Arbalest is a mix of Precision Shot and Siege
[2:31:23] <%Lightwolfe> woolie blind
[2:31:26] <awalr> battery spending spree time
[2:31:32] <RogueMinja> Blind.
[2:31:32] <%mitchteck> No rockets lock on is so goos
[2:31:32] <+gustavozxd> destroyer blade is fucking insane
[2:31:32] <Darren716> Woolie blinder than normal
[2:31:32] <%GeneralSCPatton> Destroyer Blade is the best
[2:31:34] <Louie_Salmon> I honestly think the default fire is way better than either of those modes
[2:31:35] <@Solidus_113> SEIGE BOYSSSSSSSS
[2:31:42] <%GraceTBM> agreed louie
[2:31:45] <RichochetForce> Destroyer blade is wild
[2:31:46] <1matheuw> CLEAVE
[2:31:46] <ScreamLord> Basically Dead Space Linegun
[2:31:47] <%SuperKirby24> Destroyer Blade is fuckinb Kreygasm
[2:31:51] <a_mad_dragon> DEAD SPACE
[2:31:52] <%Javaa01> Destroyer Blade is cool, but impractical as fuck due to the recharge time, sounds cool tho
[2:31:57] <awalr> I felt like i never had the time to wait for a destroyer blade to charge
[2:31:59] <%GraceTBM> i didn't think the default ballista shot was good til i watched battlemode players
[2:32:00] <RichochetForce> It's crazy how many enemies it kills
[2:32:01] <haisho> Destroyer Blade is a future investment
[2:32:04] <+gustavozxd> @Louie_Salmon yeah definetly, but destroyper blade looks really cool
[2:32:11] <@Solidus_113> go use batteries
[2:32:11] <MayorRev> SourPls
[2:32:12] <RichochetForce> @haisho Yes
[2:32:13] <%mitchteck> Charge up for the blade is not worth it
[2:32:14] <%Javaa01> Get a mod with your batteries
[2:32:17] <%SuperKirby24> might as well be a bfg with the amount of enemies it takes out Kreygasm
[2:32:17] <%GraceTBM> awal and java, it gets easier to use after mastery upgrade, but still tough
[2:32:20] <Them00n> Ripatorium?
[2:32:22] <BlackermanZX> the weapon mods
[2:32:25] <%Shishi1205> get an upgrade drone
[2:32:26] <%GeneralSCPatton> It eats plasma cells
[2:32:26] <KeystoneA2> @WoolieVersus Don't forget you can visit the Ripatorium on the bottom floor to experiment with new guns and work on weapon challenges
[2:32:28] <%Asuterisuku> Ripatorium!
[2:32:30] <%Solidnick18> oh yeah use your key
[2:32:31] <turbofolk> Skins or upgrades
[2:32:32] <thunderborn32> have you guys seen the speed run where they found out how to full auto sniper rounds with the auto rifle
[2:32:34] <%GeneralSCPatton> Crystals
[2:32:36] <Saltmeisterr> is the ARK next?
[2:32:38] <stanlychicken> Looks more like a halo ship than a weapon
[2:32:43] <%Javaa01> Cookies are the least important things here
[2:32:44] <Arrowheart17> Sentinel crystals is prob your best option
[2:32:45] <%Solidnick18> crystals are good
[2:32:45] <%GeneralSCPatton> @thunderborn32 Yes
[2:32:46] <awalr> yeah you're supposed to like start charging it while flying through the air but even then the time is rough
[2:32:48] <@Solidus_113> FeelsGoodMan
[2:32:48] <%rosemon5001> did you atleast check the suit outside the tower?
[2:32:50] <%GraceTBM> @thunderborn32 pretty sure that actually just got patched
[2:32:51] <+leviting> nah, super gore nest next
[2:32:52] <ralphfromdk> Saltmeisterr Gorenest is next
[2:32:56] <%Solidnick18> takes 2
[2:32:57] <randominternetsurfer> that's not a weapon upgrade, it unlocks mods.
[2:32:57] <VJdarkworld> super gore nest
[2:33:04] <+Ether101_Prime> @Saltmeisterr Super Gore Nest then ARC HQ.
[2:33:04] <Saltmeisterr> aight
[2:33:05] <%tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus get armor
[2:33:05] <thunderborn32> @GraceTBM honestly, good that was broken
[2:33:09] <megaman_sentinel> where is he keeping them lol
[2:33:10] <%tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus armor cool
[2:33:13] <%Irridium> BLADE
[2:33:16] <%GraceTBM> i really wish you could skip the battery anim
[2:33:18] <a_mad_dragon> BLADE
[2:33:19] <@Solidus_113> DESTROYER BLADE
[2:33:22] <RogueMinja> Arbalest first.
[2:33:23] <@Solidus_113> NotLikeThis
[2:33:24] <Visorak6> RIP
[2:33:24] <%doomerskeletor13> breebuPog
[2:33:25] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[2:33:25] <CoffeeSlice> :0
[2:33:26] <%Shishi1205> Arbalest is better
[2:33:28] <KeystoneA2> naw, arablest is best
[2:33:29] <%Solidnick18> hahaa
[2:33:29] <%AlteisenReiseZ> ARBALEST
[2:33:30] <%Javaa01> Blade is kinda bad
[2:33:32] <Saltmeisterr> blade is way to slow
[2:33:34] <%GeneralSCPatton> We were THIS CLOSE TO GREATNESS
[2:33:36] <%Asuterisuku> Metroid Prime 3: Making the primary sin of the previous two games optional. Of course, I'm a completionist for those games, so I did them anyway.
[2:33:37] <%Irridium> but Blade tho
[2:33:39] <+gustavozxd> destroyer blade is not the most useful, too slow
[2:33:42] <+YabbaTroll> arbalest is way more practical
[2:33:42] <VJdarkworld> i went with blade and it was way too slow, arbalest be useful
[2:33:43] <Nested_Dreams> Arbalest doesn't suck immediately
[2:33:44] <BlackermanZX> arbalest first since destroyer blade kinda needs the mastery
[2:33:44] <%Irridium> BUT IT LOOKS COOLER
[2:33:45] <RichochetForce> BLADE WARRIORS RISE UP
[2:33:46] <@Solidus_113> BLADE IS LITERAL SEIGE MODE
[2:33:46] <%GraceTBM> @thunderborn32 agreed, stuff like that makes speedruns no fun to watch, that and the scroll wheel flying
[2:33:47] <%SuperKirby24> Arbalest is pretty cool too tho
[2:33:47] <SyLuX45> Destroyer Blade is to slow for my liking
[2:33:48] <ralphfromdk> This thing is basicly to instagib flying stuff from range
[2:33:48] <%Asuterisuku> Arbalest is definitely recommended.
[2:33:51] <gunsrlove> Heart is Blade, but Brain is Arbalest, you know this chat.
[2:33:56] <Louie_Salmon> Blade is more rad, at least
[2:33:59] <%GraceTBM> i think everyone agrees that arbalest is the way to start
[2:34:01] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @turbofolk
[2:34:02] <Nested_Dreams> True...
[2:34:02] <RunningNGunning> Blade has nothing on the OG Seige mode
[2:34:06] <%Javaa01> Blade becomes usable once master it, but before that it's cool, but impossible to use in a fight without getting killed first
[2:34:06] <Darren716> Arblast is life but blade is hometown
[2:34:07] <RichochetForce> @gunsrlove Sounds like Jedi nonsense...
[2:34:07] <Saltmeisterr> gunsr is the most right
[2:34:11] <+gustavozxd> @gunsrlove painful truth
[2:34:11] <%Asuterisuku> Arbalest deletes Cacos and another demon that you haven't seen yet. And Revenants.
[2:34:12] <snakest3alth> Get some suits
[2:34:12] <huskarl_zap> Blade iz best WAAAAGH
[2:34:15] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Full Speed
[2:34:20] <Nested_Dreams> Oh it mrows when charged
[2:34:23] <@Solidus_113> you can't CUT an Arachnotron IN HALF WITH ARBALEST
[2:34:23] <huskarl_zap> I'm bullshitting in know its shit
[2:34:26] <%GraceTBM> arbalest deletes revenant? sick
[2:34:27] <%Solidnick18> Yes
[2:34:30] <%Javaa01> Grab these crystals
[2:34:31] <%dekkitout> Arbalest-tan has spoken ThankEgg
[2:34:33] <Louie_Salmon> He'll get to play with the destroyer blade later.
[2:34:41] <%Solidnick18> only when you get it i think
[2:34:42] <Saltmeisterr> arbalist is the closest to siege mode
[2:34:42] <venomfury86> imagine the super shotgun having a mod for pulling enemies towards you
[2:34:44] <Darren716> SQUARE
[2:34:45] <%Lightwolfe> If only there was a button
[2:34:49] <%Solidnick18> Oh
[2:34:56] <randominternetsurfer> @solidus_113 but you can get MAULED by how slow the Blade is.
[2:34:57] <%Javaa01> Get both and get Loot Magnet
[2:35:01] <%Shishi1205> get an ammo one
[2:35:05] <1matheuw> loot magneth is great
[2:35:05] <RogueMinja> Lootmagnet's pretty good.
[2:35:09] <%Irridium> @randominternetsurfer okay but consider: it looks cool
[2:35:09] <MayorRev> i hope he gets the classic suit sometime
[2:35:11] <Saltmeisterr> @venomfury86 devs specifically said that killed the pace of the gane
[2:35:13] <@Solidus_113> only if you're some kind of slow coward
[2:35:20] <Saltmeisterr> game8
[2:35:20] <%Solidnick18> Loot magnet
[2:35:21] <%DesertPenguin> Those two "At Max Health" ones ARE FUCKING USELESS
[2:35:23] <BlackermanZX> loot magnet is underrated
[2:35:23] <gunsrlove> @Solidus_113 Yeah, you can only cut the trash mobs with the blade LUL
[2:35:25] <Saltmeisterr> game*
[2:35:25] <%DesertPenguin> You are never at full health
[2:35:26] <%GraceTBM> destroyer blade and microwave attachment both suffer dramatically by slowing you down in a game that demands fast movement
[2:35:27] <%Asuterisuku> The "For Blood" ones should always be last.
[2:35:27] <%Javaa01> Magnet
[2:35:33] <randominternetsurfer> @irridium can't argue with that.
[2:35:33] <+NO_STRO_MO> there would be a plethora of physics issues if the super shotgun pulled lesser enemies towards you
[2:35:41] <%DesertPenguin> You are never at full health or armor so ignore those two
[2:35:42] <1matheuw> max health doesnt mean max armor
[2:35:44] <Saltmeisterr> didn't they buff microwave?
[2:35:45] <%Solidnick18> just sucks it all up
[2:35:52] <Saltmeisterr> or was it heat blast
[2:35:56] <%Shishi1205> you can get full magnet
[2:35:56] <venomfury86> @saltmeisterr i know :)
[2:36:01] <MayorRev> get the classic suit
[2:36:02] <%GeneralSCPatton> Save cosmetics for last
[2:36:04] <MayorRev> poggg
[2:36:04] <%Javaa01> You can wait a mission to get the cosmetics
[2:36:05] <%GraceTBM> @Saltmeisterr absolutely, they buffed microwave. I haven't tried it yet
[2:36:05] <Darren716> Cosmetics should be last
[2:36:07] <%DesertPenguin> You'll get more than enough for the upgrades, don't worry
[2:36:07] <sniffy77> i would get the armor/health/ammo upgrades first
[2:36:08] <+TheOneCalledRock> but classic doom though
[2:36:09] <+greenfall> cosmetics dead last
[2:36:13] <Saltmeisterr> :)
[2:36:13] <BlackermanZX> you look cool enough
[2:36:14] <%DesertPenguin> Classic Doomguy!
[2:36:15] <%Solidnick18> Upgrades for now
[2:36:17] <%GraceTBM> cosmetics hella last
[2:36:18] <%DesertPenguin> IT IS
[2:36:19] <a_mad_dragon> GET HUGE
[2:36:19] <ralphfromdk> Vanilla doomslayer looks fire already
[2:36:22] <turbofolk> Skins last always
[2:36:24] <RunningNGunning> The eternal Woolie struggle, style vs practicality
[2:36:25] <%DesertPenguin> You'll get enough upgrades in the missions
[2:36:25] <MayorRev> yeah get upgrades first for sure
[2:36:26] <Them00n> Woolie needs upgrades as he is a massive scrub unfortunately.
[2:36:27] <%DesertPenguin> This is a waste
[2:36:29] <%Solidnick18> cosmetics are dead last
[2:36:29] <+TheBigTaco> ye upgrades
[2:36:30] <cheesedburgers> It’s first person cosmetics don’t matter nothin
[2:36:33] <%Shishi1205> there's 2 crystals
[2:36:33] <awalr> man the ballista is such a good looking fantasy bullshit gun i love it
[2:36:34] <+gustavozxd> skins only show up on cutscenes anyway
[2:36:35] <%Javaa01> Mod bot is not worth it over crystals
[2:36:36] <+jepupu> Can also get cookies
[2:36:39] <1matheuw> doom 2 music is great
[2:36:41] <%WanderingSwordsman> you will get more batteries than you need
[2:36:41] <%Asuterisuku> Thank you for being reasonable, Reggie. So many LPers wasted an early two batteries on the Classic suit...
[2:36:42] <%Javaa01> You already have a mod on all your guns
[2:36:44] <@Solidus_113> FeelsGoodMan FeelsGoodMan FeelsGoodMan FeelsGoodMan FeelsGoodMan FeelsGoodMan
[2:36:46] <%paladinstarbuster> fucky wucky
[2:36:47] <%DesertPenguin> @gustavozxd and they're fucking awesome lol
[2:36:47] <zocano> Get both crystals
[2:36:48] <gunsrlove> Za Bureido
[2:36:48] <MayorRev> how many batteries does he have
[2:36:51] <+gustavozxd> did woolie not want classic gun view?
[2:36:53] <@Solidus_113> 5
[2:36:54] <%Shishi1205> Don't get remote
[2:36:59] <MayorRev> oooh
[2:36:59] <%DesertPenguin> No classic view either
[2:36:59] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:37:01] <%Javaa01> Remote is great
[2:37:02] <Darren716> Remote is trash
[2:37:03] <%GraceTBM> remote det sucks in this game
[2:37:06] <%Solidnick18> remote is poop
[2:37:09] <%WanderingSwordsman> remote is solid
[2:37:09] <%GeneralSCPatton> Blade feels so good
[2:37:11] <+greenfall> remote is actually pretty strong
[2:37:11] <%DesertPenguin> Remote Detonate is bad
[2:37:12] <%Irridium> remote is great
[2:37:14] <%GraceTBM> remote was waaay better in 2016
[2:37:14] <zocano> Remote has one really good use
[2:37:15] <randominternetsurfer> Remote Detonation is EXCELLENT for the Marauder.
[2:37:16] <memes_are_cancer> remote deto is grear for pc
[2:37:18] <megamonmon123> split decisions on remote
[2:37:19] <MayorRev> lul chat
[2:37:21] <%GoldeNOVA> Woolie doesn't have the centralised view?
[2:37:21] <%DesertPenguin> Good fucking luck
[2:37:21] <%Lightwolfe> but can you tho?
[2:37:24] <%Shishi1205> You punch pnkies now
[2:37:25] <VJdarkworld> @randominternetsurfer shhhhh
[2:37:25] <+TheBigTaco> go for it then man
[2:37:27] <venomfury86> by the way, there's a secret beneath the 2016 suit
[2:37:28] <turbofolk> Remote is fine fuck off
[2:37:28] <%Asuterisuku> Pinkies die from a single Blood Punch.
[2:37:30] <awalr> remote detonation is good against [redacted]
[2:37:31] <@Solidus_113> FeelsGoodMan FeelsGoodMan FeelsGoodMan FeelsGoodMan FeelsGoodMan FeelsGoodMan FeelsGoodMan FeelsGoodMan
[2:37:31] <RichochetForce> Remote is actually really good.
[2:37:33] <%Javaa01> Remote Detonation lets you use the rocket launcher without killing yourself in the process
[2:37:33] <@Solidus_113> WE GONNA CUT
[2:37:34] <%chiluzza> chiluzza subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 3 month streak! Hey Woolieoo and reggiegigas after the Dokapon Salt Mine closing down, is there any other game you guys think of running, more of the RPG parrty games like Gauntlet etc?
[2:37:35] <%GraceTBM> it doesn't do much damage with remote det
[2:37:36] <+TheBigTaco> remote is fiiiiiine
[2:37:37] <megamonmon123> naw do what you wanted to woolie
[2:37:39] <Nested_Dreams> There are other things where you want to blow it up from behind
[2:37:41] <MayorRev> Let them fight
[2:37:42] <grimshuck> you're probably more likely blow yourself up
[2:37:42] <+CptnCampy61> Remote is not great
[2:37:42] <a_mad_dragon> vinny it was japes, vinny it was not japes
[2:37:45] <RichochetForce> It wipes entire groups out
[2:37:49] <+TheBigTaco> chat are tyrants
[2:37:56] <+TheOneCalledRock> honestly chat does it really matter that much?
[2:37:56] <BlackermanZX> Mastered blade is pretty deadly
[2:38:00] <+RyTYoung> Was wondering what this music was 😂
[2:38:01] <%DesertPenguin> Remote requires you to be paying attention to where it is so you know when to blow it up. I'd rather lock on, fire and forget. And move to another enemy
[2:38:02] <RichochetForce> Locked on has better alternatives in other weapons
[2:38:03] <%Shishi1205> Blade is better than remote and laser for sure
[2:38:03] <Tuna_Can_0> remote is pretty nice to peak corners and det
[2:38:04] <%GraceTBM> @RichochetForce entire groups of baby enemies you can just grenade
[2:38:05] <+TheOneCalledRock> like does it really really matter?
[2:38:06] <Saltmeisterr> U MUST PLAY THE GAME LIKE ME
[2:38:08] <SyLuX45> Remote is for Crowd Control is really good and the explosion is really large
[2:38:14] <RichochetForce> @GraceTBM Grenades are better spent elsewhere
[2:38:14] <@Solidus_113> FeelsGoodMan FeelsGoodMan FeelsGoodMan FeelsGoodMan FeelsGoodMan
[2:38:16] <@Solidus_113> YES
[2:38:17] <%Asuterisuku> @rytyoung Into Sandy's City, a track from DOOM II.
[2:38:17] <+gustavozxd> ok but classic view is sick tho
[2:38:20] <MayorRev> pogggg
[2:38:21] <%paladinstarbuster> GAUSS CHAN

[2:38:56] <memes_are_cancer> REEEEEEE
[2:38:56] <SainEdge> elaREE
[2:38:57] <RichochetForce> Certain enemies have no answer to remote detonantion. Go ahead, try it.

[2:39:03] <%tearfuldevil> "it's the sound a frog makes" suuuuuuure it is
[2:39:06] <%GeneralSCPatton> That was a quality REE right there
[2:39:06] <%doomerskeletor13> It’s my way or the highway!
[2:39:06] <turbofolk> LP ruined hit the reset button
[2:39:07] <RogueMinja> The charge on destroyer is superlong, just a warning.
[2:39:08] <$realm_forge> Screeeeeeeeeee!
[2:39:08] <venomfury86> Quake 2 music goes with every fps
[2:39:13] <1matheuw> yeyeye
[2:39:13] <+VidulaSaix> Is Woolie saying he wants BIG BUMBER
[2:39:15] <memes_are_cancer> Soon

[2:39:17] <+VidulaSaix> NUMBER, EVEN
[2:39:20] <+gustavozxd> the commander keen one is sick
[2:39:23] <RichochetForce> Wait, number?
[2:39:26] <%Javaa01> Tracks are marked on the map
[2:39:27] <a_mad_dragon> thpbbbbbbbbt to cosmetics
[2:39:28] <RichochetForce> Pat infesting this stream?
[2:39:31] <%GraceTBM> I love the unlockable quake music in this
[2:39:32] <zocano> Get a crystal
[2:39:34] <%Asuterisuku> Darkness doesn't scare Commander Keen!
[2:39:34] <RichochetForce> Numbers go UP?
[2:39:35] <%Irridium> the commander keen one is on the outside, before one of the costumes
[2:39:38] <+TheOneCalledRock> they should be marked on the map
[2:39:41] <%Irridium> I forget which one
[2:39:47] <zocano> You still have batteries left for a crystal
[2:39:49] <%J0RD4NPR1M3> quad machine is my favorite track
[2:39:55] <%GeneralSCPatton> Ya passed the elevator
[2:39:58] <MayorRev> god this track is amazing
[2:39:59] <%doomerskeletor13> Listening to your dead Grandpas mixtape while you look at his skull on your bookshelf
[2:40:02] <+gustavozxd> that's a bit of an asspull but sure
[2:40:07] <MayorRev> the harpsichord is great
[2:40:08] <%Shishi1205> The most effective use for the batteries are the sentinel crystals
[2:40:14] <@Solidus_113> THE SOUND
[2:40:16] <+gustavozxd> ITS SICK
[2:40:18] <@Solidus_113> FeelsGoodMan
[2:40:19] <Tuna_Can_0> BRRRMMM
[2:40:19] <venomfury86> more like a Pacific Rim reference
[2:40:22] <%BallerSwagBro9k> sipsipGasm sipsipGasm sipsipGasm
[2:40:22] <%paladinstarbuster> MY DICK
[2:40:23] <+TheOneCalledRock> the sound design in this game is SO GOOD
[2:40:23] <+Ether101_Prime> I think Keen either on one of the wings going in front of the fortress or in this room.
[2:40:26] <%GeneralSCPatton> The sound of power
[2:40:27] <RichochetForce> Delicious noise
[2:40:31] <%andrex2311> woolieGASM woolieGASM Kreygasm woolieGASM woolieGASM
[2:40:32] <%Javaa01> Yeah, the audio mixing on the Ballista is fantastic across the board
[2:40:33] <+RyTYoung> That's some deep argent energy noise
[2:40:33] <+VidulaSaix> How about just learn where to go Kappa
[2:40:37] <%GraceTBM> venom especially since hugo worked on both
[2:40:44] <MayorRev> oh yeah classic tunes while training
[2:40:46] <%Asuterisuku> So yeah, have fun with Ballista-chan~
[2:40:46] <memes_are_cancer> Ready for some BFG division?
[2:40:49] <+greenfall> ship too BIG
[2:40:50] <+cleese> for a doom guy theres too much saftey in this ship
[2:40:52] <1matheuw> hey chat did woolie get the arc news already?
[2:40:55] <@Solidus_113> FeelsGoodMan FeelsGoodMan
[2:40:55] <%doomerskeletor13> Hugo Martin worked on Pacific Rim so that’s probably why all the mechs are in the game
[2:40:57] <+RyTYoung> BIG LASER
[2:40:59] <%Asuterisuku> @memes_are_cancer You won't hear it when something else is playing from a poster.
[2:41:06] <%Shishi1205> Blade is 50
[2:41:08] <%Asuterisuku> In this case, Into Sandy's City.
[2:41:24] <memes_are_cancer> Aw damn that sucks
[2:41:25] <%doomerskeletor13> Ballista is super useful and effective for a later enemy
[2:41:26] <%Asuterisuku> He got BFG Division the first time through though.
[2:41:33] <%GeneralSCPatton> Arbalest requires accurate sniping, which is a problem. Destroyer Blade just clears rooms.
[2:41:35] <%GraceTBM> I love the 2020 mix of bfg div
[2:41:42] <%Javaa01> The explosion is the same as an explosive barrel
[2:41:49] <Saltmeisterr> i don't personally like how the chainsaw is now a glorified reload
[2:41:50] <%Asuterisuku> Blade takes too long to charge and stunts movement.
[2:41:56] <%Asuterisuku> In a game where you want to always keep moving.
[2:42:00] <%Javaa01> And you can't move while charging
[2:42:01] <%Shishi1205> Vs pain elementals Arbalest is a must
[2:42:05] <+TheOneCalledRock> oh, does BFG division play here? i always play E1M1 when i go here LUL
[2:42:06] <+gustavozxd> @Asuterisuku yep FeelsBadMan
[2:42:09] <RogueMinja> And you can't move.
[2:42:11] <%Irridium> but it looks really cool which is what matters
[2:42:13] <+Ether101_Prime> Doesn't the Arbalest do extra damage to flying enemies?
[2:42:14] <stanlychicken> dash during blade charge
[2:42:15] <+hod_fareview> @Asuterisuku Use the ice bomb then switch to ballista
[2:42:15] <gunsrlove> Destroyer blade clears rooms of trash mobs, while the big ones are turning your ass inside out
[2:42:18] <MayorRev> HMMMMM
[2:42:26] <BlackermanZX> thats why you have to upgrade it first
[2:42:26] <%Javaa01> Blade has collision with the environment
[2:42:31] <%DesertPenguin> Siege Mode dude
[2:42:35] <%DensityD> This is great, I got into a online matchup in castle crashers on steam
[2:42:38] <Ner234> It's so cool tho
[2:42:39] <Saltmeisterr> @WoolieVersus the ballista is also good against flying enemies
[2:42:40] <%doomerskeletor13> The Ripatorium is a good feature
[2:42:40] <$realm_forge> Blade is a good opening shot weapon
[2:42:44] <RichochetForce> Destroyer, IIRC, kills everything in one shot aside from super heavies
[2:42:48] <%GraceTBM> if the blade didn't have collision it would be my hard favorite
[2:42:58] <@Solidus_113> you haven't seen it delete an Arachnotron
[2:42:58] <%GraceTBM> @lewdskeletor13 too bad it locks itself post campaign
[2:42:58] <%Javaa01> Siege mode but balanced, and without as much single target damage
[2:43:03] <RogueMinja> Destroyer's super powerful, but you're also super slow while charging.
[2:43:05] <gunsrlove> Nowhere near as good as SIEGE MODE. Rip to a real one.
[2:43:05] <%DesertPenguin> For whenever single mother fucker in the room is pushing you into a corner.
[2:43:06] <cheesedburgers> Siege mode was Too Good
[2:43:08] <%DesertPenguin> when ever*
[2:43:09] <venomfury86> you can shoot before the full charge if you upgrade it
[2:43:09] <+TheOneCalledRock> @DensityD yo people still palying castle crashers? PogChamp
[2:43:11] <+hod_fareview> @GraceTBM Like the crossbow in dusk?
[2:43:14] <%Shishi1205> yes
[2:43:14] <%Javaa01> Yes
[2:43:14] <KeystoneA2> yes
[2:43:15] <+TheOneCalledRock> yes
[2:43:16] <%Irridium> yes
[2:43:17] <%Javaa01> You can grind here
[2:43:17] <%DesertPenguin> YES YES YES
[2:43:17] <%Asuterisuku> Yes, they do count to your challenges.
[2:43:17] <RichochetForce> Yes
[2:43:18] <%DianaTheAscian> yes
[2:43:21] <stanlychicken> ye
[2:43:21] <+segmentedfool> yes
[2:43:22] <%andrex2311> yes
[2:43:24] <RogueMinja> Yes.
[2:43:27] <%Asuterisuku> Unfortunately, you can only do the ripatorium once between missions.
[2:43:29] <BlackermanZX> yeah
[2:43:31] <+TheOneCalledRock> ogc
[2:43:33] <Griffin2210> I did -not- know that
[2:43:35] <megaman_sentinel> do it
[2:43:47] <%GraceTBM> @hod_fareview ooh, that's something to look forward to when i get around to it
[2:43:47] <KeystoneA2> you can only do it once between missions
[2:43:52] <MayorRev> and to think they wanted to add anti cheat when you can farm in the safety of your lair Kappa
[2:43:53] <randominternetsurfer> you can't. you can only access it once.
[2:43:56] <%Shishi1205> Once in between tho
[2:43:59] <memes_are_cancer> Off screen grinding baybee
[2:44:06] <+greenfall> the next mission is a big one too
[2:44:07] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:44:08] <%GraceTBM> @WoolieVersus unless it's been patched, the ripatorium locks itself post campaign
[2:44:11] <gunsrlove> Kill some enemies in mission, die , repeat, optimal farming Kappa
[2:44:11] <%Shishi1205> Get a crystal
[2:44:12] <%DesertPenguin> The next mission will take you another full hour
[2:44:15] <Louie_Salmon> You can get that one super fast just by doing it in missions
[2:44:16] <%Asuterisuku> You've already done your one ripatorium run this time.
[2:44:20] <+TheBigTaco> Being able to only do it between missions is really weird
[2:44:21] <$realm_forge> Balls deep or nothin at all
[2:44:22] <+TheOneCalledRock> @Shishi1205 is it really only once? never tested it LUL
[2:44:26] <RogueMinja> Still one more thing openable.
[2:44:27] <%Shishi1205> yes
[2:44:33] <%Javaa01> It's a cheat code
[2:44:33] <%Asuterisuku> Super Gore Nest so good!
[2:44:33] <+TheOneCalledRock> lame
[2:44:35] <Yummy_Nukes> you ought to get a crystal tbqhwy
[2:44:40] <%Shishi1205> A cheat code
[2:44:40] <trickybird> crystals bruh
[2:44:48] <%Javaa01> But you need to unlock the door for the cosmetic to get it
[2:44:52] <venomfury86> Cheat code
[2:44:52] <%GraceTBM> @WoolieVersus you have to unlock this cosmetic before you can get the secret
[2:44:53] <trickybird> cant get secrets til later
[2:44:55] <%Solidnick18> you can get it now if you want but you gotta use batteries to get it
[2:44:57] <+gustavozxd> oh yeah that room
[2:44:57] <RogueMinja> Outside.
[2:45:01] <%Asuterisuku> You can get that secret without unlocking the door. @Javaa01
[2:45:04] <%Shishi1205> You actually can cheese it and not open the skin
[2:45:07] <%DesertPenguin> Getting outside isn't that easy lol
[2:45:10] <%rosemon5001> outside the tower
[2:45:13] <%Shishi1205> Joel got it like that
[2:45:14] <@Solidus_113> you need to buy the 2016 skin to get that
[2:45:17] <%Solidnick18> the tower
[2:45:19] <%DesertPenguin> This place is so confusing sometimes
[2:45:21] <Saltmeisterr> i think the super gore nest is my favorite level in whole level
[2:45:22] <%GraceTBM> do you gauss jump, or just air control to get it without the armor
[2:45:29] <venomfury86> i opened it because i like the skin
[2:45:30] <cheesedburgers> God this place is a maze
[2:45:34] <%Asuterisuku> Neither, just double jump and dash.
[2:45:35] <%gatorafan> Universe is chaos
[2:45:46] <KeystoneA2> you have to open it to get it
[2:45:46] <%Javaa01> Oh you can double jump over the invisible wall
[2:45:47] <%Shishi1205> Nah cheese it
[2:45:48] <%GraceTBM> god, i feel like air control is super op, circle strafing enemies in the air is so much fun
[2:45:48] <%Solidnick18> gotta use batteries
[2:45:48] <megamonmon123> uep
[2:45:50] <%Asuterisuku> There's an invisible wall, but it doesn't go out far enough to actually block you.
[2:45:50] <%DensityD> +1
[2:45:51] <trickybird> cant get without spending batterires on the skin
[2:45:53] <stanlychicken> you can cheese it

[2:48:04] <+aishman> @WoolieVersus It's a cosmetic AND a cheat thing I believe
[2:48:04] <randominternetsurfer> @sleepy_pixels which OG Suit?
[2:48:09] <%Javaa01> You have to go through the hole now
[2:48:11] <megamonmon123> no the secret scum is what got patched
[2:48:12] <%Shishi1205> Rip the cheese
[2:48:13] <%DesertPenguin> Just unlock the suit for the content
[2:48:14] <%GraceTBM> yeah, looks like it's been patched
[2:48:14] <RichochetForce> Yeah, they raised the death wall.
[2:48:15] <%DesertPenguin> CONTENT
[2:48:15] <%Solidnick18> yep nope gotta spend it then
[2:48:16] <venomfury86> honestly it's my favorite suit
[2:48:16] <%rosemon5001> you will literally be drowning in the upgrades
[2:48:17] <MayorRev> Doomguy cant shoot invisible walls sadly
[2:48:18] <%SuperKirby24> yeah, you can cheese it, oh wait, it got patched LUL
[2:48:19] <%Solidnick18> that sucks
[2:48:21] <%DesertPenguin> C O N T E N T
[2:48:22] <%Shishi1205> no
[2:48:22] <%Asuterisuku> Need to get the suit to get DOOM 1 now then.
[2:48:25] <%Shishi1205> Cheat code
[2:48:28] <Yummy_Nukes> crystal is more worthwhile right now
[2:48:29] <+aishman> @WoolieVersus The secret is a cheat code.
[2:48:30] <AWalkingErection> i prefer the other cosmetic personally anyway
[2:48:34] <sleepy_pixels> @randominternetsurfer the 1993 suit
[2:48:37] <MayorRev> look for the new music?
[2:48:38] <%GraceTBM> i don't really like getting excessive tokens upgrade points and batteries
[2:48:38] <gunsrlove> Getchu a crystal
[2:48:39] <trickybird> crystalllll
[2:48:41] <%Asuterisuku> Crystals.
[2:48:42] <%Shishi1205> Crystals my dude
[2:48:43] <+gustavozxd> chat knows and they will not resist not telling you calebKek
[2:48:45] <%SuperKirby24> crystals
[2:48:45] <%Solidnick18> crystals
[2:48:47] <%DesertPenguin> Get the classic skin because we said so LUL
[2:48:49] <%doomerskeletor13> You’ll get enough batteries so don’t sweat I
[2:48:51] <+Ether101_Prime> There's more then enough batteries to get everything in the Fortress of Doom.
[2:48:52] <BlackermanZX> loot succ is gud
[2:48:54] <+TheOneCalledRock> LOOT SUCC
[2:48:58] <%Solidnick18> woolie wants the good succ
[2:48:59] <%GraceTBM> @DesertPenguin we already got pat's stream for that
[2:49:05] <%Asuterisuku> More than enough everything to get everything, frankly.
[2:49:06] <randominternetsurfer> The LOOT KIRBY
[2:49:08] <Arrowheart17> You’ve only got 1 Crystal
[2:49:14] <+gustavozxd> there's literally more than enough batteries, idk what the extra ones are for
[2:49:17] <%DesertPenguin> And Pat appreciates the classic doom more so it's okay
[2:49:18] <venomfury86> there will be more than enough batteries
[2:49:19] <SyLuX45> Crystals are always better than Weapon upgrades
[2:49:23] <%doomerskeletor13> The classic skin looks so goofy in cutscenes
[2:49:26] <%Shishi1205> @gustavozxd if you miss some
[2:49:29] <MayorRev> i can listen to this track all day
[2:49:33] <snakest3alth> Use the key you got for the Unmaykr
[2:49:34] <@Solidus_113> big ammo
[2:49:40] <%DesertPenguin> My only gripe is they could've remade the classic suit without the exposed abs lol
[2:49:42] <haisho> loot magnet?
[2:49:45] <%BinaryFireball> old doom music is best music
[2:49:46] <%GraceTBM> snakest doesn't matter til he has all of them
[2:49:52] <+gustavozxd> I went for ammo as much as i could
[2:49:52] <%DesertPenguin> You will never have full anything so ignore those two
[2:50:04] <%DesertPenguin> Loot Magnet is good for now
[2:50:06] <%paladinstarbuster> its so you dont wast drops
[2:50:09] <%DesertPenguin> Because armor yea
[2:50:13] <Louie_Salmon> Eat yer SHLOOT
[2:50:15] <venomfury86> loot magnet was my first pick
[2:50:16] <%Shishi1205> Ammo tho
[2:50:19] <haisho> loot magnet has both ammo and armor
[2:50:25] <%DesertPenguin> number go up
[2:50:33] <megamonmon123> you can still put it in
[2:50:35] <%GraceTBM> those full health upgrades are okay as final upgrades, so that you can go into fights with blood punch loaded
[2:50:39] <BlackermanZX> yeah you will kinda need a lot of health and armor later
[2:50:39] <%Asuterisuku> This next map is so good.
[2:50:41] <%DesertPenguin> @megamonomn123 giggity
[2:50:49] <%Shishi1205> Check the map
[2:51:01] <%Shishi1205> OST should be marked

[2:51:35] <%GraceTBM> does anybody else really like the Doom 3 theme? it feels almost at home in this soundtrack. almost
[2:51:35] <%DesertPenguin> !! DIRECTION AT RISK !!
[2:51:46] <+gustavozxd> this place is confusing i don't blame him
[2:51:48] <%doomerskeletor13> It’s very easy to get lost here
[2:51:53] <%Shishi1205> after the use

[2:52:12] <@Solidus_113> now would be time to stop
[2:52:14] <knackirontarkus> Doom 3 theme goes hard

[2:52:20] <+TheBigTaco> !uptime
[2:52:20] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 58 minutes
[2:52:22] <%doomerskeletor13> Tfw your favorite YouTubed hasn’t uploaded
[2:52:28] <Yummy_Nukes> WHO'S READY TO GO TO THE VATICAN
[2:52:35] <%GraceTBM> i think doom 3's theme is literally the best thing about that game.
[2:52:43] <%Solidnick18> to the super gore nest
[2:52:44] <%doomerskeletor13> Hellified Vatican
[2:52:52] <gunsrlove> 5/13
[2:52:55] <%GeneralSCPatton> @gracetbm Soul Cube is pretty rad as a concept
[2:52:57] <%Asuterisuku> Can't go back to the ripatorium anyway.
[2:53:03] <%Shishi1205> Ripatorium is once after every mision
[2:53:11] <+CptnCampy61> This level is great
[2:53:12] <%GeneralSCPatton> Can only do ripatorium once after mission
[2:53:12] <%doomerskeletor13> Soul Cube is on Doomguys desk too!
[2:53:27] <%GraceTBM> @GeneralSCPatton you're totally right, i even love it's voice clips, they're so surreal. I never beat it, just watched it completed, so i forgot about it
[2:53:32] <%gatorafan> SUPER GORE
[2:53:33] <@Solidus_113> SGN has my 2nd favourite track
[2:53:34] <snakest3alth> This is the mission they showed on QuakeCon 2018
[2:53:39] <pixel_river> Super gore
[2:53:46] <ralphfromdk> Gotta go fast :o
[2:53:46] <%doomerskeletor13> This mission is girthy
[2:53:51] <%doomerskeletor13> Lotta secrets and shit
[2:53:53] <+Ether101_Prime> You only get one Ripatorium pervist.
[2:53:54] <Louie_Salmon> I'm a fan
[2:54:01] <+OUTheTeam> is this the level with the kick ass lore art or is it the next one?
[2:54:04] <+TheBigTaco> its dumb
[2:54:05] <gunsrlove> Grindo no Grindo
[2:54:10] <venomfury86> Doom 3 theme is good, i don't get why Pat said it's a weird pick
[2:54:11] <%GeneralSCPatton> @gracetbm ŰŠĘ ŲŚ!
[2:54:12] <KeystoneA2> you can replay missions though, so...
[2:54:14] <%GraceTBM> this mission is fun, cool, aesthetically interesting, and fucking kicks your ass up and down the street the first time you play it
[2:54:14] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[2:54:16] <%gatorafan> Woolie only gets ONE
[2:54:21] <Darren716> Fuck that pinkie challenge
[2:54:23] <RichochetForce> @OUTheTeam That's the next level
[2:54:23] <Visorak6> The third mission is HELL
[2:54:28] <+YabbaTroll> @OUTheTeam i think your probably thinking of the one after the next one
[2:54:28] <Louie_Salmon> I mean yeah you can just redo any mission for the same effect
[2:54:29] <%Solidnick18> pretty easy
[2:54:30] <RichochetForce> That pinke challenge is awful
[2:54:30] <%DensityD> PJSalt
[2:54:34] <+maenos2> 3 different

[2:54:38] <@Solidus_113> FAT level
[2:54:38] <%FuqBoiSlim> why would you put a limit on a training room???

[2:54:40] <KeystoneA2> jump kill, front kill, back kill -- easy
[2:54:43] <%SuperKirby24> fuck the secret encounters in this stage DansGame
[2:54:45] <%Solidnick18> Fucking bitch
[2:54:47] <%doomerskeletor13> Replaying the other levels, it shouldn’t take long to get that SSG mastery
[2:54:47] <+gustavozxd> this lady has some good lines here
[2:54:48] <+Ether101_Prime> I think they did it to prevent it being milked during One-Up and Ultra-Nightmare.
[2:54:51] <%Solidnick18> go away
[2:54:53] <Th3rd3> fear not TehePelo
[2:54:54] <%Asuterisuku> Pinky's got some of the best GKs though.

[2:59:35] <@Solidus_113> CUTTO
[2:59:42] <%BinaryFireball> IT COMES FROM HELL
[2:59:46] <%Asuterisuku> This section of the game as a while is REALLY, REALLY GOOD.
[2:59:49] <%zenith0111> 🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘
[2:59:53] <thunderborn32> we dead space nao
[2:59:55] <RAH001> da read
[2:59:57] <$realm_forge> Ever wonder where Arby’s gets their meat?
[3:00:00] <%GeneralSCPatton> YOU CAN'T KILL THE METAL
[3:00:01] <%zenith0111> 🤘
[3:00:10] <@Solidus_113> don't forget frags
[3:00:11] <%GraceTBM> yeah, you could ignore the mankys in 2016, they were so fat that they couldn't hit you in anything narrower than a barn
[3:00:22] <vVAstrAVv> told you those shields troll lpl
[3:00:31] <%GraceTBM> but here those mankys will fuckin evaporate your health if you don't deal with them
[3:00:51] <%GraceTBM> those shields are so fucky, but honestly i love having them around to mix things up
[3:00:55] <+gustavozxd> why is the regular melee so weak
[3:00:55] <%Shishi1205> Melee omega sucks
[3:01:01] <%Asuterisuku> Dash into demons instead of regular melee.
[3:01:03] <%doomerskeletor13> Man this level slaps
[3:01:06] <%DensityD> BLUD PUNCH
[3:01:06] <+NO_STRO_MO> it's for bullying
[3:01:07] <%GraceTBM> standard melee does 0 damage and just staggers grunt bitches
[3:01:12] <@Solidus_113> Dashing does damage and staggers
[3:01:14] <%GeneralSCPatton> Dashing into someone does more damage than melee
[3:01:15] <randominternetsurfer> @asuterisuku that was patched out.
[3:01:16] <%DensityD> @NO_STRO_MO LUL
[3:01:17] <hat_under_bread> Regular melee is so bad it takes literally 100 punches to kill a basic zombie on nightmare.
[3:01:26] <%thesyndrome> IT'S BLUUD!
[3:01:27] <%GraceTBM> this level feels like the first real playground
[3:01:27] <%Asuterisuku> Well damn.
[3:01:32] <Louie_Salmon> Dashing into demons does more damage than a punch
[3:01:34] <%GeneralSCPatton> Wait, they patched the dash damage?
[3:01:35] <Batmagoo> nightmare doesn't change hp values tho
[3:01:35] <+TheOneCalledRock> SUPER GORE NEST
[3:01:38] <soller123> @hat_under_bread how is difficulty relevant
[3:01:46] <randominternetsurfer> @louie_salmon that was patched out
[3:01:54] <%GraceTBM> i've actually had dash damage fuck me over more often than it helps
[3:01:54] <Louie_Salmon> Really? weird
[3:02:05] <vVAstrAVv> ok but how MUCH more damage does dashing do
[3:02:09] <%Javaa01> Nah, dash still does damage
[3:02:12] <randominternetsurfer> @louie_salmon yeah. patched with update 1
[3:02:16] <%Javaa01> Just less on bigger enemeis
[3:02:21] <%Asuterisuku> Especially since the milestone from dashing into a charging pinky is still there.
[3:02:23] <%GraceTBM> vvastra enough to sometimes kill zombies outright

[3:03:04] <%thesyndrome> I think dashes STILL do more damage than melee, even after the patch
[3:03:08] <%Javaa01> @randominternetsurfer You needed multiple hits with it on higher difficulties before this anyways
[3:03:11] <%Shishi1205> Snek

[3:03:42] <%GraceTBM> I really really wish you had to time the grenade into the caco while it's mouth was open instead of just "at it's mouth whenever"
[3:03:44] <%SuperKirby24> OUTTA NOWHERE
[3:03:49] <venomfury86> it's a shame they patched the speedrun super jump

[3:04:02] <CoffeeSlice> LUL

[3:04:09] <%GraceTBM> yeah i usually accidentally kill zombies i want to glory with the dash, i don't like it
[3:04:17] <%Shishi1205> You keep releasing l2 when you are hooked
[3:04:17] <%doomerskeletor13> God that glory kill rocks

[3:04:25] <+NO_STRO_MO> The upside to being bad at the game is the music goes on forever
[3:04:35] <thunderborn32> @venomfury86 that happened because they showed a live speedrun to the developers and one of them got super pissed
[3:04:37] <%Solidnick18> alright

[3:05:02] <cheesedburgers> I had a lot of trouble with that mission
[3:05:04] <phantalime> reload checkpoint for your mission challenge
[3:05:07] <venomfury86> @thunderborn32 true
[3:05:08] <%GraceTBM> asurite you can just uninstall the denuvo now
[3:05:09] <%Javaa01> There's like 6 pinkies in this level
[3:05:13] <@Solidus_113> This level has a BUNCH of backtracking, so don't worry about things you can't get yet
[3:05:13] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:05:14] <+segmentedfool> I think there are 4

[3:05:19] <%doomerskeletor13> Yeah you can still do it
[3:05:22] <%GraceTBM> java i'm pretty certain there's only 3 and a phantom
[3:05:24] <%Shishi1205> You pressed too soon
[3:05:26] <%Irridium> yeah I think there's 4 pinkies in this whole level
[3:05:27] <%GraceTBM> and the phantom doesn't count
[3:05:30] <BlackermanZX> Oh yeah theres like 3 pinkies in thismission
[3:05:34] <%Irridium> oh right the phantom
[3:05:40] <cheesedburgers> 3 left I think
[3:05:41] <%Javaa01> @GraceTBM The pinkies in the Slayer Gate count
[3:05:47] <Batmagoo> phantom counts. 100% speedrunners use it
[3:05:47] <%Asuterisuku> Spectre*
[3:05:48] <asurite_warrior> Cool
[3:05:49] <%thebeargoesHONK> Hey Woolie got a fighting game question for you. Do you think timers should continue to run during super animations? IE: when both players can not control their characters
[3:05:56] <%SuperKirby24> there's a slayer gate in this level? gg Kappa
[3:05:58] <%Irridium> either way. 3 pinkies.
[3:06:03] <%GraceTBM> @Javaa01
[3:06:11] <+thelonechris> Basically, it's bad
[3:06:22] <%GraceTBM> @Javaa01 ooooh, i wish i knew that when i played this instead of replaying it 3 times

[3:07:10] <RunningNGunning> Wide hips
[3:07:10] <%DensityD> wide load
[3:07:10] <%thesyndrome> I wouldn't worry too much about it, the game has WAY MORE currency than it has need for them; I had SO MANY mastery points, sentinel batteries, etc, and nothing left to spend it on
[3:07:15] <%GraceTBM> that door isn't designed for the CHONK
[3:07:17] <+maenos2> @venomfury86 how the fuck, 22 minutes?
[3:07:21] <%gibbityhibbity> I tortured myself looking for this secret too, you have to come back to them later

[3:07:45] <%thesyndrome> oh shit i never noticed that lol
[3:07:48] <venomfury86> a streamer called Xamide
[3:07:52] <%Shishi1205> This map is return heavy
[3:07:54] <%DensityD> it spins omg
[3:07:58] <turbofolk> this is not lineal progress level
[3:07:59] <%GraceTBM> bitch you WILL pay attention to it whether you like it or not
[3:08:04] <%doomerskeletor13> speeen
[3:08:09] <%J0RD4NPR1M3> secrets are kinda hard to find in this level
[3:08:13] <RogueMinja> You can get one of them right now.
[3:08:14] <%Asuterisuku> It kind of IS a linear level, but the line loops back on itself.
[3:08:18] <%DensityD> we orbit boys
[3:08:23] <T_Sasquatch> Speed runs with boundary breaks aren't cool. Prove me wrong 4Head
[3:08:31] <KeystoneA2> This level is so big that it'll probably be the last one for today
[3:08:37] <%GraceTBM> there was one of the secrets involving double jumps and spinning jump bars that took me SOOOO long to find
[3:08:43] <randominternetsurfer> PLEASE save the weapon mod unlock for later.
[3:08:45] <%doomerskeletor13> Yeah some secrets are hard locked till later in the level, dont stress if you can’t get them right away
[3:08:47] <%HowIPendragon> Someone should really tell him not to worry about secrets for this level. Everything unlocks right before the end
[3:08:50] <+Tyonidus> howdy dis game gud
[3:08:52] <%DensityD> "pops" are funny
[3:08:55] <%GraceTBM> @KeystoneA2 he said he probably won't finish this one today before he started it
[3:08:56] <RichochetForce> Yup, 2 different pieces of dialogue
[3:09:01] <%Shishi1205> leave it for later?
[3:09:09] <+VidulaSaix> Yeah she's always worth exhausting dialogue until she repeats
[3:09:14] <%Shishi1205> elp
[3:09:14] <thunderborn32> more so, somebody remind him the other shotgun still exiists
[3:09:15] <%DesertPenguin> Hey, a weapon mod, not like you need to unlock all those others on the ship LUL
[3:09:21] <%Javaa01> Not worth leaving this one later
[3:09:23] <+thelonechris> Imagine siding with the demons, only to get put into the PR department
[3:09:28] <randominternetsurfer> SAVE IT FOR LATER
[3:09:35] <venomfury86> it's nice they are removing Denuvo from the game
[3:09:36] <%Javaa01> You get an upgrade for your next gun after you get it via intended progress regardless
[3:09:38] <RichochetForce> Fun? Save it for later.
[3:09:46] <%Solidnick18> SourPls
[3:09:46] <@Solidus_113> SourPls
[3:09:49] <%GraceTBM> @WoolieVersus doesn't matter if you WANT to leave these until later, you can't get them until other paths unlock

[3:10:24] <@Solidus_113> we groovin
[3:10:25] <%GraceTBM> god, dread knight is the glass cannon that some people want the marauder to be
[3:10:25] <KeystoneA2> you meet enemies earlier than you're supposed to if you do slayer gates
[3:10:27] <Gigigear21 > you still had lock on on the rocket woolie
[3:10:44] <venomfury86> Dreadknights are cool
[3:10:51] <%Shishi1205> they have 2
[3:10:56] <%Shishi1205> but you are mid battle
[3:10:58] <+YabbaTroll> the usually do
[3:10:59] <%GraceTBM> @KeystoneA2 I still remember the one where the cyberdemon is just THERE and how surprised i was
[3:11:02] <%doomerskeletor13> Gwyneth Paltrow get your Goop outta here
[3:11:16] <+thelonechris> monkaS
[3:11:22] <KeystoneA2> @GraceTBM 2 at once, even. That slayer gate is gonna be fun to watch him do.
[3:11:25] <+VidulaSaix> It was a murder hornet monkaS
[3:11:26] <venomfury86> here they are called Tyrants
[3:11:28] <%chiluzza> Bird gang checking in on reggie
[3:11:29] <%GraceTBM> your super shotgun is veeery sticky
[3:11:45] <%Asuterisuku> To kill the Tyrant, shoot it until it dies.
[3:11:48] <%doomerskeletor13> Maybe the bird was trying to get a secret and ran into the glass
[3:11:52] <randominternetsurfer> HEY CHAT, do you think Woolie will get the THING in this level before the stream ends? or will it end soon? @everyone
[3:11:53] <%GraceTBM> keystone it was 2!!!! i didn't remember that!
[3:12:00] <@Solidus_113> he won't
[3:12:04] <%thesyndrome> arbalest is the better one woolie
[3:12:06] <%Shishi1205> Damn the textures suffer when you rotate quick
[3:12:07] <+VidulaSaix> Day will end soon
[3:12:07] <%doomerskeletor13> He def won’t
[3:12:10] <%DensityD> don't threaten me with a good time
[3:12:16] <%thesyndrome> destroyer beam is kinda unusable in most situations
[3:12:16] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:12:17] <%DesertPenguin> Microwave
[3:12:17] <%Irridium> heat blast upgrades are real good
[3:12:19] <%zenith0111> Shoulda went with Black Mage Kappa
[3:12:23] <%doomerskeletor13> He’s got the next stream in a few hours, probably wants some time inbetween
[3:12:28] <%DesertPenguin> Charge time is good
[3:12:41] <%thesyndrome> charge time is the better one
[3:12:47] <%DesertPenguin> But you have to get both eventually
[3:12:51] <venomfury86> can't wait for the "reveal"
[3:12:51] <%Lightwolfe> Falter is just a small stagger
[3:12:54] <%doomerskeletor13> Heat blast is disgustingly good fully upgraded
[3:12:57] <%mitchteck> Lock on burst tho
[3:13:01] <%Javaa01> The charge time is abysmal by default so yeah, fixing that up is the way to go
[3:13:05] <%DensityD> what is Canada's economy like around America's Independence day on July 4th?
[3:13:08] <%GraceTBM> heat blast is your THIRD shotgun
[3:13:11] <%Asuterisuku> Everything is OP when mastered.
[3:13:16] <%DensityD> anything pop up in stores for a weekend?
[3:13:19] <%thesyndrome> ice blast is so good with those 2 upgrades
[3:13:27] <%DensityD> you love it.
[3:13:34] <%Asuterisuku> Oh god this next room.
[3:13:40] <%Asuterisuku> I worry for Woolie's sanity.
[3:13:42] <%Lightwolfe> no booly
[3:13:47] <%GraceTBM> does ice+damage upgrade microwave enemies faster?
[3:13:49] <%doomerskeletor13> The Flesh factory
[3:14:02] <%thesyndrome> doom 3 reference

[3:14:22] <%KongolComet> KongolComet subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months!
[3:14:24] <%andrex2311> LUL
[3:14:25] <%GraceTBM> i think the amount of reference to doom 3 in this game is the right amount
[3:14:26] <%thesyndrome> dont even trip, dog
[3:14:28] <+thelonechris> I like how the pinky just stopped right in front of you
[3:14:30] <%Asuterisuku> Hang on there's a secret back there you can get now.
[3:14:32] <%DensityD> shit. fuck. I'm too big and strong.
[3:14:36] <%GraceTBM> I did that so many times on accident
[3:14:36] <%DensityD> my feet are too nice
[3:14:41] <Hal10k> You don't need to beat every challenge to unlock everything
[3:14:41] <@Solidus_113> the teeth
[3:14:42] <%Asuterisuku> Go back to the starting area.
[3:14:43] <cheesedburgers> This one sucks
[3:14:46] <%GoldeNOVA> Saitama problems
[3:14:48] <%WanderingSwordsman> go back
[3:14:49] <%doomerskeletor13> Pretty much every Doom game gets a shout out in this
[3:14:54] <Louie_Salmon> I had to reload checkpoints like 20 times to get this
[3:14:54] <%GeneralSCPatton> MIXOM IS FROM DOOM 3. They canonically made the chainsaw in Eternal if you look in the model viewer.
[3:14:56] <%GraceTBM> also it's bullshit that that 1up has invisible walls preventing you from getting it from the other side
[3:15:00] <RogueMinja> You can get the suit point at the beginning.
[3:15:03] <venomfury86> yeah, that's the real problem with the challenge
[3:15:11] <%Javaa01> Battery is half a level away
[3:15:18] <%Javaa01> So don't even think about it yet
[3:15:21] <%Shishi1205> did the chick bug?
[3:15:29] <%Asuterisuku> @GeneralSCPatton There's a fun thing in that game involving reversed textures and an imitator company called MOXIM.
[3:15:29] <%DesertPenguin> Who is MIXOM?
[3:15:38] <%GraceTBM> mick even referenced the audioscape of the opening cinematic of doom 3 for one of the tracks in this game
[3:15:48] <%doomerskeletor13> breebuGun
[3:15:56] <%Asuterisuku> Go get that cookie.
[3:16:19] <venomfury86> there's also a remix of the Doom 3 theme in 2016
[3:16:20] <%Shishi1205> nani
[3:16:21] <@Solidus_113> ????
[3:16:22] <DXLelouch24> Cant get that cookie for awhile

[3:16:33] <%WanderingSwordsman> you can
[3:16:35] <%GraceTBM> really venom?? do you know the name of the track
[3:16:36] <%Irridium> oh boy here we go
[3:16:40] <%thesyndrome> oh shit
[3:16:43] <%Shishi1205> KILL THAT ASAP
[3:16:48] <Batmagoo> it's the fuck room
[3:16:51] <%Asuterisuku> The extra life on the pillar was the key to opening that door.
[3:16:52] <BlackermanZX> DESTROY that shit first
[3:16:53] <%DesertPenguin> FUCK THIS SHIT
[3:16:55] <+Sleepy_Puma> ITS GOTTA GO

[3:16:59] <KeystoneA2> "lol get fucked nerd"
[3:17:01] <%andrex2311> that totem is buff :O
[3:17:01] <%GraceTBM> I don't mind buff totems, i think they're okay. This room is a pretty bad intro to them though
[3:17:01] <%Asuterisuku> RIP this room.
[3:17:03] <%DesertPenguin> This is rough
[3:17:03] <%thesyndrome> dont even fight enemies until you destroy that

[3:28:42] <+VidulaSaix> It's times like this where you really want Air Control Woolie
[3:28:44] <+gustavozxd> controller problems
[3:28:50] <%DensityD> good work
[3:28:53] <%DensityD> toys
[3:28:53] <%GraceTBM> look at casual woolie trying to get it with an exploit
[3:28:54] <+thelonechris> Cool
[3:28:57] <+NameInsertable> Does he not have the air mobility rune?
[3:28:58] <%GraceTBM> he totally nailed it
[3:29:01] <ShibaGearSolid> hey Everyone meticHey
[3:29:06] <+the_vedo_show> that yellow door opened
[3:29:08] <%doomerskeletor13> Gotta be fast like sanic
[3:29:12] <venomfury86> @gustavozxd just as you said it :)
[3:29:15] <RichochetForce> @ShibaGearSolid Hello
[3:29:20] <cipher758> sup
[3:29:51] <%Asuterisuku> He looked at the open door to the cookie and walked past it.
[3:29:53] <+gustavozxd> @venomfury86 its not impossible but still annoying with a controller
[3:29:57] <%GoldeNOVA> You could totally take these environments and use them in a horror game
[3:30:00] <Arrowheart17> Cookie door opened
[3:30:03] <+gustavozxd> having to look directly at the ledge to climb
[3:30:13] <%ChoculaUltra> but Doom is a horror game. But for the demons.
[3:30:20] <KeystoneA2> shut up karen
[3:30:23] <awalr> a whole lot of melting happening here
[3:30:25] <%paladinstarbuster> WOOF
[3:30:28] <%GraceTBM> just transplant this flesh geometry into doom 3 and it would totally fit
[3:30:29] <@Menitta> dear god
[3:30:31] <%Asuterisuku> Both usually trigger just by staying in the area.
[3:30:32] <%GeneralSCPatton> AND WE'RE COOKING HUMAN STEW!
[3:30:36] <+NO_STRO_MO> woolie won't touch it LUL
[3:30:36] <SyLuX45> Doom 3 was a horror game imo
[3:30:37] <+VidulaSaix> Karen talks when karen wants!
[3:30:41] <venomfury86> @gustavozxd yes, sometimes the dash goes sideways
[3:30:43] <%DensityD> She doesn't even know about the "universe" she just knows about Earth, Mars, Hell and our Solar System
[3:30:44] <cipher758> blue karen won't shut up
[3:30:55] <%Asuterisuku> Missed the Rune too.
[3:31:04] <+the_vedo_show> atpHorns this room
[3:31:26] <%DaBigVitus> so how long is the main game?
[3:31:32] <venomfury86> blue Karen is the worst
[3:31:37] <infinite_rotation> There like halfway
[3:31:46] <Brutalyte616> @woolieversus You see that yellow keycard icon at the top of your screen?
[3:31:47] <RichochetForce> @DaBigVitus 12-15 hours
[3:31:48] <%Asuterisuku> Closer to 2/5ths.
[3:31:49] <%Shishi1205> Blorb in the middle
[3:31:52] <%doomerskeletor13> Dr Karen Manhattan
[3:31:56] <+gustavozxd> this room is fun, i'd love to fight demons infinitely here.......
[3:32:04] <%GeneralSCPatton> SOUL SPHERE!
[3:32:06] <venomfury86> i call this the Quakecon level
[3:32:16] <%GraceTBM> 13-23 hours depending upon how long you take to find the secrets
[3:32:17] <+YabbaTroll> BTW @chat, did anyone every actually get invaded by another player in the campaign? I enabled the option and never met anyone else at launch
[3:32:18] <%Asuterisuku> Save the quad damage.
[3:32:18] <@Solidus_113> all of your HP was fucking DELETED
[3:32:20] <Louie_Salmon> This is the bumblest it has ever been
[3:32:30] <%DesertPenguin> It wasn't int he game at launch
[3:32:33] <%DesertPenguin> They just added it recently
[3:32:33] <+NO_STRO_MO> invasions haven't been added
[3:32:35] <BlackermanZX> monkaS
[3:32:36] <RichochetForce> Bumble Warriors RISE!
[3:32:37] <+YabbaTroll> oh lol
[3:32:40] <%GraceTBM> @YabbaTroll It wasn't ready at launch and it still isn't
[3:32:46] <+YabbaTroll> well damn
[3:32:48] <DXLelouch24> Get the powerup you fool
[3:32:51] <%Javaa01> You have to be in punching range for it to work
[3:32:53] <%doomerskeletor13> A Series of Unfortunate Events
[3:33:02] <%GraceTBM> you can now get Empowered Demons, which are still AI but buffed up, but not player demons yet
[3:33:13] <%FuqBoiSlim> more like Scrub Punch
[3:33:17] <infinite_rotation> This game was great but it felt so short to me
[3:33:19] <Louie_Salmon> Weird how the punch only does damage if the fist hits the enemy
[3:33:22] <%Asuterisuku> Wow, he actually went left!
[3:33:22] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:33:35] <+gustavozxd> oh man LUL
[3:33:42] <%GraceTBM> that was an amazing quad damage
[3:33:48] <venomfury86> oops, chainsaw
[3:33:51] <DXLelouch24> Big waste
[3:33:51] <@Solidus_113> the bumblest
[3:33:52] <+NO_STRO_MO> powerups increase duration upon kills
[3:33:52] <+YabbaTroll> launch time was probably the only time that system could work
[3:33:54] <RichochetForce> Do it for the QUAD
[3:33:55] <%tealplague> best quad I've ever seen
[3:33:56] <%doomerskeletor13> Big bumbles
[3:33:57] <%Javaa01> A whole two bullets out of that entire quad
[3:34:03] <+YabbaTroll> not as many people playing now i bet
[3:34:07] <+TheBigTaco> as graceful as a slug slapped against a window
[3:34:20] <%GraceTBM> yeah those features sounded really cool, but the concurrent campaign players are gonna be way lower now
[3:34:21] <@Solidus_113> they invasion system isn't even in the game yet
[3:34:27] <%doomerskeletor13> Is their a release date for the DLC? I know they showed off a few screenshots
[3:34:28] <+gustavozxd> @Javaa01 8 bullets worth of damage PogChamp
[3:34:31] <%Asuterisuku> They only just got Empowered demons.
[3:34:34] <Louie_Salmon> I'm being honest, I don't think I have ever seen more bumble than this single room
[3:34:35] <@Solidus_113> ID needed to do demon testing through battle mode first
[3:34:40] <SyLuX45> Noticed he can’t shoot and parkour at the same time lol
[3:34:42] <awalr> wet fish slap to humiliate the demons
[3:34:44] <%GraceTBM> there's really few fodder enemies in this arena actually
[3:34:44] <+YabbaTroll> ah
[3:34:47] <%GeneralSCPatton> The reticle tells you if you can chain
[3:34:52] <BlackermanZX> big stumbos
[3:34:55] <venomfury86> they should bring back the Arcade Mode from 2016
[3:35:06] <%kulmoth> woolieMINHSTINCT
[3:35:20] <BlackermanZX> ye really need the air control for this part
[3:35:23] <infinite_rotation> Imagine a doom arcade game that had a small booth with a mouse and keyboard.
[3:35:23] <%GraceTBM> @venomfury86 they've mentioned that they're going to look at things like that and mod support, but there's other stuff on the table first
[3:35:24] <%Asuterisuku> @venomfury86 Remember that Arcade Mode was, itself, post-launch content.
[3:35:33] <+thelonechris> That guy's literally running in fear
[3:35:44] <@Solidus_113> Reminder Snapmap was removed to make time for battlemode and invasions
[3:35:57] <$SilverRoddo> Battle-coward.
[3:36:03] <%Javaa01> Snapmap was garbo anyways
[3:36:06] <%GraceTBM> did anybody really care that much about snapmap coming back?
[3:36:10] <%Javaa01> Due to the console memory limitations
[3:36:11] <%ChoculaUltra> rip snapmap
[3:36:18] <%Javaa01> Meaning you couldn't do jack shit with it
[3:36:19] <%Asuterisuku> There are a lot of people that would disagree with you, Javaa.
[3:36:21] <%SilvaChariot0133> LUL
[3:36:21] <CoffeeSlice> YEYEYEYE
[3:36:24] <stanlychicken> Snapmap was worse forge mode
[3:36:25] <%Javaa01> Beyond creating a single room arena
[3:36:39] <KeystoneA2> lewd

[3:36:44] <%Asuterisuku> Oh, there's your problem. Console.
[3:36:48] <+VidulaSaix> LUL
[3:36:53] <@Solidus_113> just not using rockets
[3:37:03] <%GoldeNOVA> limp shotty
[3:37:09] <%GraceTBM> gimmick maps, recreations of other games and working calculators of things are impressive, but not really much in terms of game content
[3:37:10] <+the_vedo_show> psaCaco
[3:37:15] <Louie_Salmon> I mean, he has killed himself many times with rockets, so I get it
[3:37:16] <%Asuterisuku> I love how the blood punch staggered the other caco behind it.
[3:37:19] <%FuqBoiSlim> #goodcrack
[3:37:21] <%Asuterisuku> Happy accidents.
[3:37:28] <venomfury86> Tower of Babel was a cool custom map
[3:37:42] <%DensityD> process the demons
[3:37:43] <%GraceTBM> i think blood punch auto knocks cacos into glory kill mode
[3:37:49] <%GraceTBM> which is super fun

[3:39:24] <%Asuterisuku> One of my favourite maps. Except for that first Totem room.
[3:39:25] <infinite_rotation> You got enough?
[3:39:27] <%GraceTBM> I REALLY wish the infinite ammo cheat hadn't replaced Rich Get Richer. It was nice to feel like you earned your infinite ammo by playing flawlessly

[3:44:47] <+NO_STRO_MO> and then being allowed to clean up your mess

[3:53:32] <venomfury86> KAR EN TUK
[3:53:32] <%DensityD> nice pants
[3:53:33] <%Javaa01> Also, Rad suit damage no longer scales with difficulty
[3:53:38] <%Javaa01> So the damage is low across the board
[3:53:39] <%DesertPenguin> Was anyone happy they brought back the Rad Suit from earlier games?
[3:53:42] <SainEdge> thats rad!

[4:00:55] <%GeneralSCPatton> Same
[4:00:56] <%DensityD> feel it
[4:00:56] <%Shishi1205> You can but its better to ignore the big
[4:00:57] <%DesertPenguin> Just remember you most likely always have a single pip for fodder
[4:00:58] <%Solidnick18> the little lines
[4:01:02] <+NO_STRO_MO> well if you save them up you can think of it as a weapon
[4:01:08] <%DesertPenguin> Admittedly, there's a lot on the UI to look at it
[4:01:08] <@Solidus_113> you can change your UI colour @WoolieVersus they might change with it
[4:01:17] <%rosemon5001> its clear your just turning into male paige
[4:01:18] <+NO_STRO_MO> be better with ammo usage and look for fuel
[4:01:18] <%Asuterisuku> Hook's cooldown is on the crosshair.
[4:01:22] <venomfury86> make the UI bigger in the settings
[4:01:22] <%Shishi1205> The hook enters cd and the icon dissapears

[4:01:26] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[4:01:35] <megaman_sentinel> crosshair

[4:01:55] <%GraceTBM> If you haven't yet, I recommend turning on the big UI elements setting
[4:02:03] <RichochetForce> YES
[4:02:06] <%DesertPenguin> Yea, make the UI as big as you an
[4:02:06] <Tuna_Can_0> just shove it in Kreygasm
[4:02:08] <%Shishi1205> The chainsaw kill on the arachnotrons is pretty cool
[4:02:09] <%GraceTBM> yeah, you really just don't chainsaw big dudes
[4:02:18] <RichochetForce> @Shishi1205 That kill is incredible
[4:02:21] <%DesertPenguin> Chainsaw is for "fodder" enemies
[4:02:24] <RichochetForce> I did it by accident once and screamed
[4:02:29] <lotharrio> It quietly recovers some gas now, doesn't it?
[4:02:36] <%GraceTBM> you need to refill your ammo so often that it's really tough to save enough gas

[4:02:47] <%GraceTBM> @lotharrio 18 second auto refill of the first pip
[4:02:49] <huskarl_zap> PAt's people
[4:02:52] <penitentpentwitch> This game feels like it doesn't like 'saving' for big guys as far as ammo conservation goes in early game. Thought it's the best choice for challenges.
[4:02:52] <%DesertPenguin> I see bird in reflection
[4:03:02] <venomfury86> the bird is mortally challenged
[4:03:16] <%GraceTBM> I didn't even think about it for challenges, cause I never had enough pips by that point
[4:03:30] <%GraceTBM> AND you can't fire your weapon
[4:03:32] <%DensityD> PJSalt
[4:03:40] <%DesertPenguin> If you're looking at your HUD you're doing it wrong. It's more about feel and timing.
[4:03:50] <%GraceTBM> I really wish you could swap grenade types during the glory and chainsaw kills
[4:03:58] <%Shishi1205> You can do it by hearth with the Sounds
[4:03:58] <%DensityD> How do I watch the CupHead anime?
[4:04:02] <@Solidus_113> get those twitch reflexes on POINT, GAMER
[4:04:09] <SyLuX45> Ammo, Health, Armor, Fuel, Cooldowns, while killing all the demons is a lot to think about and manage lol
[4:04:10] <+OUTheTeam> they expect you to constantly chainsaw fodder not wait for the low on ammo warning
[4:04:11] <%Shishi1205> Every mechanic has a sound associated with it
[4:04:13] <penitentpentwitch> The exploding/respawning barrels that drop ammo via upgrades really help ammo conservation later on.
[4:04:15] <%GraceTBM> in 2016, the chainsaw was an emergency button for a kill or an ammo refill
[4:04:33] <%Javaa01> Javaa01 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! Important thing to note about the universal mechanics of Eternal: The game has a magic pixel system that's always active in the campaign, so if you're at 30 health, and you take a hit that would do 35, you will always live with 1-6 hp left

[4:05:40] <BlackermanZX> Kar en TUK the kids
[4:05:41] <zocano> Big spoilers
[4:05:44] <%DesertPenguin> Don't spoiler
[4:05:46] <%Shishi1205> I mean its nothing big
[4:05:47] <%Asuterisuku> Karen Took
[4:05:47] <+NO_STRO_MO> it's hardly a spoiler
[4:05:58] <@Menitta> Karen Took LUL
[4:05:58] <%DesertPenguin> It's not a spoiler but it's a fucking cool moment so don't ruin it
[4:05:58] <%SirGO0SE> chat are you misbehaving again
[4:05:59] <RichochetForce> lol
[4:06:00] <%Irridium> I don't think it's even mentioned what it is in any of the lore books so not rally spoilers
[4:06:01] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[4:06:06] <%DesertPenguin> It's a cool moment, don't ruin it
[4:06:09] <@Solidus_113> You won't know it in game. It's part of the language Mick Gordon made for the metal choir to sing @WoolieVersus
[4:06:09] <turbofolk> Thats not even a spoiler its nonsense
[4:06:12] <%GeneralSCPatton> KAR EN TUK is a vibe. It's an experience.
[4:06:25] <+VidulaSaix> Yeah dumb videogame shit!
[4:06:26] <%Shishi1205> The game doesn't tell you what it is @DesertPenguin
[4:06:27] <venomfury86> it's not a spoiler if you don't say that it's a spoiler
[4:06:28] <%DesertPenguin> Not every spoiler has to be plot or something. Just knowing a thing is a thing can be a spoiler
[4:06:32] <%Shishi1205> You have to know
[4:06:38] <bleugh> idk if they look realistic exavtly
[4:06:40] <%DesertPenguin> @Shishi1205 You'll get the idea when it plays in the mission that it plays in
[4:06:41] <%DensityD> Easy mode unlocked was a silly moment. I think I only like seeing it come from WoolieVersus.
[4:06:45] <zocano> Chat knows nothing but how to gunjump and spoil
[4:06:46] <%GraceTBM> it would be nice if there were a toggle to make the pickups more immersive
[4:06:49] <RichochetForce> The Caco eye POPS with a cartoon noise
[4:06:50] <%Shishi1205> Will woolie get it?
[4:07:02] <+Aeoneth> This is how Doomguy sees the world. Those Ammo packs aren;t actually there, they're actually demon babies

[4:12:00] <@Solidus_113> I gotta practice Lethal League
[4:12:01] <penitentpentwitch> Doom for FPS, KOTOR for long running RPG. Regularly rotating fighting games. What are we missing for 'flavor' game wise?
[4:12:07] <%andrex2311> LUL
[4:12:10] <%Solidnick18> Mvc2 and lethal league Kreygasm
[4:12:25] <notgarza> Is MAHVEL night?

[4:12:30] <%Shishi1205> yeah
[4:12:31] <%Javaa01> The ability is on DEATH

[4:12:59] <+dekker21> Hi Woolie! thanks for all the years of great entertainment!
[4:13:01] <%GraceTBM> you can fuck up a lot in this game, but there's a lot of opportunities too

[4:13:19] <venomfury86> will you stream Doom 1 and 2 in the Doom Fortress? :)
[4:13:19] <+NO_STRO_MO> Doom Eternal seems to have several adaptive difficulty mechanics
[4:13:35] <+NO_STRO_MO> I've had certain enemies not spawn in on retry
[4:13:40] <%GeneralSCPatton> Hooking things literally fills me with manic glee. I look like a crazy person when I do it.

[4:14:52] <Saltmeisterr> lethal league blaze netcode isn't that good eithrt
[4:15:01] <@Solidus_113> you can just do Marvel 1 instead on Fightcade
[4:15:10] <@Solidus_113> or 3
[4:15:13] <@Menitta> I tried setting it up with a friend and had nothing but desyncs.
[4:15:21] <Saltmeisterr> its still fun tho
[4:15:24] <%Javaa01> Yeah, you're better off pulling out your X360 or PS3 and acquiring a less-then-legitimate copy of the game on either platform
[4:15:28] <%DesertPenguin> But what if we want to?
[4:15:28] <%ChoculaUltra> yeah I'll dabble in Lethal, ain't got time to setup Marvel 2 LUL
[4:15:35] <%Irridium> Marvel 3 would work
[4:15:36] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:15:55] <%DesertPenguin> I never watch the fighting games stuff. You play with us instead of randoms? That's cool
[4:16:12] <turbofolk> PIRACY BABY
[4:16:14] <%Javaa01> Or acquire it via alternate means
[4:16:23] <turbofolk> Lets GOOOOOO0OO
[4:16:27] <%Wonderbot3000> I have it 360
[4:16:29] <%Irridium> I got my 360 copy!
[4:16:40] <%GraceTBM> @DesertPenguin I think it's a mix of viewers, friends in the house, experts, and randoms depending on the game and circumstances
[4:16:41] <@Solidus_113> I have a 360 copy, but no online
[4:16:46] <%DensityD> the most well planned out streams on twitch. I'm joking KappaPride Keepo
[4:16:55] <%Javaa01> Mahvel is and now always will be in legal hell
[4:16:57] <%DesertPenguin> I wanna have Woolie beat me up in a fighting game lol
[4:17:05] <%ozzrabbit> Isn’t the 360 version backwards comparable for Xbox One?
[4:17:09] <penitentpentwitch> Do we know if Woolie ever beat the final boss of Hades on his own time?
[4:17:22] <%Irridium> @ozzrabbit not every game. Unfortunately Marvel 2 isn't one of them
[4:17:23] <%DensityD> Keepo cvHazmat
[4:17:27] <huskarl_zap> tencent will just own all software at some point

[4:18:22] <%Solidnick18> idk
[4:18:22] <%Javaa01> It even has all the DLC
[4:18:23] <notgarza> The netcode, tho
[4:18:33] <%Javaa01> Even the costumes they axed off the markets
[4:18:52] <%Irridium> Probably. Less chance of wifi warriors
[4:18:52] <turbofolk> Wheres the numbers tho
[4:19:04] <%Javaa01> Yeah, the netcode is the least terrible on PC
[4:19:07] <@Menitta> hey MVCI has good online....
[4:19:16] <%jiggy_snipe> I don't think most people are playing MvC3 on pc
[4:19:17] <penitentpentwitch> Research required!
[4:19:19] <%Javaa01> The DLC are included in the PC release
[4:19:28] <thesickestzak> Just play rumble roses Kappa
[4:19:40] <turbofolk> All in that shit is IN
[4:19:43] <@Menitta> Same with the PS4 release.

[4:19:52] <%GraceTBM> Avg players for the last 6 months are around 100, peak 300 on steam
[4:19:59] <@Menitta> We need one more person to play online right now.
[4:20:09] <%jiggy_snipe> there are 71 people online right now on Steam, peak today was 110
[4:20:22] <%SomersaultJustice> play FEXL after they add rollback

[4:21:53] <%Irridium> I'd prefer Ultimate MvC 3 on PC
[4:21:54] <%GeneralSCPatton> This fighting game stuff is interesting, but let's not forget today's most important lesson "Once your soul has been consumed, your fear will cease to exist"
[4:21:55] <turbofolk> Mahvel?
[4:22:19] <@Solidus_113> UMVC3 is $10 on humble
