[0:03:39] <Dhurkst> @valask a Saudi company purchased a share of the company so woolie considered protesting the game,  even though SNK has nothing to do with what the Saudi govt does

[0:10:15] <%Valask> y'all ever get into the Peppa Pig Wiki?
[0:10:18] <Dhurkst> @asuterisuku woolie just said earlier the majority stake didn't go through. If you trace things back far enough, virtually every company in the world is funded by blood money. that's just how the world works.
[0:10:20] <Equirah> @leith_aziz ok? they were bought by the saudi prince who had a journalist killed at an embassy among other things

[0:20:54] <+RD_NX> Kyo is so cool in this game, the only one I've ever played was 13 so idk if his move list in this game is different or not
[0:20:54] <this_guy_115> KOF FACT: Shun's design was ENTIRELY based on the producer getting a new hite animator and saying "give me something that the kids like nowadays" and he turned around and saw the persona 5 poster on the wall
[0:20:55] <leith_aziz> My problem with Shunei's design is that it's all over the place. It's kinda what people think Guilty Gear characters look like.
[0:21:00] <this_guy_115> i am NOT lying
[0:21:02] <%Josef_Stryker> His character design is too busy
[0:21:03] <%sonofthedeepsouth> No

[0:32:07] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Yeah I mean Dolores isnt much of an Arabic name is it?
[0:32:09] <odd_slater> @seydaq Nah just look up Shun'Ei KOF14 dlc outfit lol
[0:32:10] <Asuterisuku> Does KoF do 22 specials?
[0:32:20] <this_guy_115> Light punch heavy kick is a TAUNT
[0:32:21] <enddword> jiggle physics SeemsGood
[0:32:27] <OpenYourEels4TheNextFeels> Dolores is confirmed from Mali
[0:32:36] <%sonofthedeepsouth> There is jiggle that I love
[0:32:44] <this_guy_115> its the new mechanic
[0:32:51] <+0neReeler> saving
[0:32:52] <this_guy_115> Shatterstrike
[0:32:54] <RyuuAoi> She got Fight Angel physics!
[0:33:03] <+Ultimate_Edge> Costs one bar but you get half back for landing it
[0:33:07] <seydaq> used to only do that with counter wire but 14 changed it
[0:33:12] <Haarute> it's a great combo extender
[0:33:28] <TigerClaws12> everything after raw shatter strike is unscaled, it's good
[0:33:29] <+0neReeler> go to super
[0:33:31] <+sandrews> Seems like the stream is clear now boys
[0:33:33] <TheDrown> Upper angular bit of Mali is more Arab influenced
[0:33:36] <this_guy_115> shatterstrike is a blowback but crumples, that's it
[0:33:39] <%jinking79> man did Reggie just Jinxed himself LUL
[0:33:54] <%ChoculaUltra> is Shun'ei supposed to be the "main" character of the arc? Like how Kyo, K', and Ash were?
[0:33:58] <enddword> i'll just play Shermie
[0:34:03] <OpenYourEels4TheNextFeels> @ChoculaUltra Yes.
[0:34:09] <leith_aziz> @ChoculaUltra Seems like he's sharing the protag spot
[0:34:13] <+orochiblood> its flaccid much like Shunei himself
[0:34:14] <+0neReeler> alot more like older games, raw maxmode is pretty good
[0:34:15] <Asuterisuku> I wonder if the super does more damage if you have more MAX left?
[0:34:32] <%ChoculaUltra> oh wow that's kinda depressing
[0:34:39] <Asuterisuku> Because otherwise you don't have any reason to not combo a lv 1 or 2 into Lv 3.
[0:34:41] <%xcompleasedad> xcompleasedad subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months, currently on a 21 month streak! KOF? Nice
[0:34:50] <this_guy_115> Regular max lasts longer and gives you more damage, quick lets you keep a combo up
[0:34:52] <stormhawk9891> Man it's wild how much cooler Isla despite having the same power set as Shun'ei
[0:35:00] <this_guy_115> and also costs less
[0:35:03] <%jinking79> GG Strive RC
[0:35:03] <%CaptainPileDriver> can't do it while autocomboing
[0:35:05] <+orochiblood> this game definitely has better hair than SF, not a high bar tho
[0:35:08] <+Reverend_Roscoe> did we just get started?
[0:35:10] <%CaptainPileDriver> auto combo does not allow it
[0:35:14] <+TopTieramisu> @stormhawk9891 because she doesn't have spastic color combinations
[0:35:15] <+0neReeler> cost 2 for quick
[0:35:30] <%ChoculaUltra> the walk/run cycles look really smooth
[0:35:32] <+TopTieramisu> also isla keeping her hands in her pockets works with her having spirit hands
[0:35:32] <leith_aziz> @stormhawk9891 Well, to me, she justt looks more JoJo/TWEWY to me. That's why it works for me
[0:35:39] <RyuuAoi> Basically just started
[0:36:12] <enddword> he's got Nero powers Kappa
[0:36:14] <+TopTieramisu> shun'ei has big pachinko energy
[0:36:22] <iamtheTwitchghost> lol the boobs jiggle
[0:36:28] <Blackenedcrustcynicism> Chris Hu description for Climax Cancel
[0:36:32] <leith_aziz> @TopTieramisu Characterisation through animations pickyEZ
[0:36:35] <+0neReeler> super > double super > climax super
[0:36:35] <this_guy_115> you can special move into EX move into super into EX super into Neomax
[0:37:09] <+0neReeler> maybe first hit cancel
[0:37:10] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:37:13] <this_guy_115> it has to be an EX move to combo into it
[0:37:17] <this_guy_115> like that
[0:37:21] <+0neReeler> then climax
[0:37:24] <%ChoculaUltra> they should've just made Shingo the new MC and given him like purple fire or some shit LUL
[0:37:34] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> how did...I forget to tune in
[0:37:39] <%ChoculaUltra> oh wait, Iori already has purple. Blue?
[0:37:41] <iamtheTwitchghost> I CLIMAXED Kreygasm
[0:37:46] <+TopTieramisu> anyone remember neo geo battle coliseum? shun'ei would fit in with the original characters from that game
[0:37:51] <Asuterisuku> 50% damage whew
[0:38:00] <Asuterisuku> Character health isn't universal is it?
[0:38:09] <this_guy_115> No
[0:38:10] <+0neReeler> can do all 3
[0:38:22] <this_guy_115> also its KoF so it has to be small anyway
[0:38:24] <+TopTieramisu> character health has been universal in kof
[0:38:27] <iamtheTwitchghost> JESUS
[0:38:31] <odd_slater> @toptieramisu Nah I feel like they kinda had a toku vibe going
[0:38:32] <this_guy_115> because of the 3v3's
[0:38:41] <%ChoculaUltra> oh that texture does not look good LUL
[0:38:42] <seydaq> @Asuterisuku Universal for now. each bar is 100 hp
[0:38:42] <Haarute> that's just a JoJo reference. she did a Secco.
[0:38:43] <leith_aziz> I dont like the mud effect, but teh super is cool
[0:38:43] <+orochiblood> He gets calcified in place and then gets pelted
[0:38:46] <+0neReeler> better than shunei
[0:38:49] <+undersea_magic> Goop Blast
[0:38:52] <@Menitta> God this looks so much better than XIV
[0:38:55] <this_guy_115> Damn that ass can fart
[0:38:57] <%townzzzzz> mud never looks good
[0:38:59] <this_guy_115> Kappa
[0:39:01] <OldManDeckardCain> everyone gangsta until they get hit by ps2 mud
[0:39:06] <+orochiblood> Yeah its hard to make mud look good
[0:39:18] <Saltmeisterr> does the audio sound tinny for anyone else?
[0:39:19] <%ChoculaUltra> you think it was intentional that the girl who controls mud also got a dumpy?
[0:39:21] <+chronopaladin> cutscene meta
[0:39:23] <beatie_g> ah, so long drawn out supers have a function
[0:39:25] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> the bitrate though NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[0:39:26] <+orochiblood> @Saltmeisterr yeah thats twitch
[0:39:41] <Saltmeisterr> game audio i mean
[0:40:00] <psimon_> twitch is shitting its pants
[0:40:07] <+orochiblood> theyve turned the audio down and also twitch is losing it today
[0:40:12] <+0neReeler> in max do climax is discounted instead of 3
[0:40:13] <seydaq> theres some timer nonesense with the cutscenes
[0:40:18] <+TopTieramisu> it also hurts shun'ei's design because his design elements don't even say much about him. one leg rolled up. is there something special about that leg? nope. headphones. is there some musical element to his character? nope
[0:40:34] <beatie_g> audio is ok for me but the damn stream is stopping and going here and there
[0:40:50] <this_guy_115> Stream is getting King Crimson'd
[0:40:52] <%ChoculaUltra> the jacket-as-a-cloak thing doesn't even really fit either
[0:41:04] <beatie_g> twitch is a stand
[0:41:07] <TigerClaws12> it says max ok cause he has 2 bars left
[0:41:11] <this_guy_115> just try it in versus
[0:41:12] <Asuterisuku> That's super weird.
[0:41:22] <+FoxLex_> There is auto recover
[0:41:25] <+rbakervv> yeah, twitch is fucked wight now, nothing woolie can do about it
[0:41:30] <RyuuAoi> Stream is actually running fine for me now on the PS4
[0:41:31] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> thanks twitch Kappa
[0:41:31] <beatie_g> yeah prob for the best
[0:41:33] <+FoxLex_> Infinite does auto recover
[0:41:34] <@Menitta> Oh no
[0:41:35] <seydaq> @ChoculaUltra just chuuni protag things LUL
[0:41:36] <+extradopeness> itz no worries
[0:41:49] <+InvisiblessedReptile> Yeah I thought it was lagging just for me and started checking my connection like crazy
[0:41:50] <TigerClaws12> @WoolieVersus bar is not recovering, it says max ok cause he has at least 2 bars
[0:41:53] <+TopTieramisu> if shun'ei was just a straight up chuuni, his design would fit perfectly
[0:42:03] <leith_aziz> @TopTieramisu Well, the headphones can signal his lack of social skills. They do this with Neku from TWEWY
[0:42:04] <+0neReeler> usually on hit
[0:42:04] <Shad0wTag> Some dude nailed it in chat, Shunei does have big pachinko energy
[0:42:05] <@Menitta> I thought it was just on my end from mobile
[0:42:17] <+extradopeness> yeah me too lol
[0:42:26] <+FoxLex_> No Woolie you can set meter to auto recover
[0:42:31] <+orochiblood> Yashiro is so fun in this
[0:42:43] <+0neReeler> he seems way stronger
[0:42:49] <this_guy_115> she has a grab like all KoF characters eventually have
[0:42:58] <beatie_g> nah twitch is just pulling a twitch moment again
[0:43:00] <%ChoculaUltra> its the black pants, white shirt but navy/yellow jacket that irks me the most.
[0:43:08] <BackwardCap> Only EX command throw has follow ups.
[0:43:13] <+InvisiblessedReptile> My team will be Shermie, Dolores and Leona, because of course it will be
[0:43:15] <+chefframza> Hey woolie limitless meter still drains
[0:43:25] <stormhawk9891> Dolores has an reverse DP anti-air grab
[0:43:26] <+thebadpope> now that see he's wearing a school uniform with the jacket off. i like his design  a little more
[0:43:34] <+chefframza> so you don't need to reset echo time for meter
[0:43:34] <RyuuAoi> WOOLIE, DO CHRIS NEXT
[0:43:38] <@Menitta> man I don't like new main character lol
[0:43:48] <Asuterisuku> I hate those button icons.
[0:43:49] <beatie_g> he has NO drip, NO color coordination, NO character, and NO ass
[0:43:50] <@Menitta> he reminds me of hand wing Sasuke
[0:43:58] <seydaq> chris CD
[0:44:02] <%ChoculaUltra> he really doesn't have that Kyo, K' or even Ash vibe at all. And everyone hated Ash LUL
[0:44:05] <TigerClaws12> shunei's design is aggressively bad LUL
[0:44:14] <+TopTieramisu> shunei has green, orange, red, and purple as pop colors. make a commitment, shun'ei
[0:44:14] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:44:24] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[0:44:25] <rattletrap69> NO hair
[0:44:27] <+InvisiblessedReptile> @ChoculaUltra It's a shame because Ash is actually cool
[0:44:28] <%AlteisenReiseZ> LUL
[0:44:29] <+OmegaZeroX2> doodLUL doodLUL doodLUL doodLUL
[0:44:29] <%baka_sugoi> NO ASS
[0:44:30] <Deko_> LUL
[0:44:30] <%scrumbotime> He's got NOTHING
[0:44:31] <%livlinn> brutal
[0:44:31] <%RyTYoung> LUL
[0:44:36] <RyuuAoi> Yeah no ass at ALL
[0:44:43] <@Menitta> LUL
[0:44:46] <0cash> dripless aoko somehow has more drip
[0:44:52] <jumpyhugs> just got in, has woolie picked a main, yet?
[0:44:53] <+TopTieramisu> give shun'ei a dumper, SNK
[0:44:53] <bigarmsnolegs> woolie comes back dressed as dolores
[0:44:59] <BurdRightsActivist> ReggieVS
[0:45:00] <this_guy_115> drip so fire woolie had to go, come on now he's good!
[0:45:01] <Asuterisuku> Do normals cancel to command normals?
[0:45:03] <+0neReeler> have to ex dp
[0:45:12] <%DomPressesButtons> @Asuterisuku yes
[0:45:12] <this_guy_115> yes asu
[0:45:13] <0cash> like jesus, give this character to the melty blood gang to fix him
[0:45:17] <RyuuAoi> Woolie taking off his daishiki
[0:45:21] <seydaq> patch benny boooty first
[0:45:31] <leith_aziz> This talk reminds me of Sugar Punch's video where he talked about Strive's new designs. Appreciate them pickyEZ
[0:45:41] <Asuterisuku> Woolie doesn't like that the fashion disaster might have cool stuff.
[0:45:48] <+kewlmyc> He's got some cool shit. It's just everything outside of his moveset sucks
[0:45:54] <+undeadarchitect> What a button woolie
[0:45:54] <%ChoculaUltra> like they knocked it out of the park with Kyo's umpteenth redesign - then you get Shun'ei LUL
[0:45:57] <+undeadarchitect> what a button
[0:46:01] <+0neReeler> when snk makes him high-tier and we have to see him on stream...
[0:46:04] <+TopTieramisu> the last thing we want is a super viable shun'ei that has a bunch of reps in top 8 at tournies
[0:46:21] <+TopTieramisu> at least it's a 3v3 game
[0:46:24] <leith_aziz> @TopTieramisu I mean, we had Tekken 6 Lars and Bob
[0:46:29] <+TopTieramisu> bob is cool

[0:46:37] <beatie_g> does he at least got good alt colors?
[0:46:43] <+0neReeler> lars has some cool looking moves atleast
[0:46:44] <Asuterisuku> RIP recording playback
[0:46:49] <JazzerThighsSSBM> !uptime
[0:46:50] <%ChoculaUltra> lets not forget that T7 Oops All Leroys year LUL
[0:46:50] <@Moobot> @JazzerThighsSSBM WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 3 minutes
[0:46:55] <+TopTieramisu> his alts have more limited palettes that are better
[0:46:55] <QThaGawd> there is no reset bind its always touchpad
[0:47:03] <+soopergohan> Is there a versus in the beta?
[0:47:08] <+soopergohan> Local versus*
[0:47:11] <+OmegaZeroX2> @toptieramisu Indeed
[0:47:21] <+OmegaZeroX2> @qthagawd Yo doodGood doodDrool doodNuts mom0kaMythradab
[0:47:25] <+McSoliace> you can turn off touchpad reset but i think you lose the easy reset
[0:47:35] <QThaGawd> @OmegaZeroX2 elchakPeaceOut
[0:47:39] <leith_aziz> Should be bridge last tiem I checked
[0:47:49] <kamenriderkickk> @soopergohan Yes
[0:47:50] <+OmegaZeroX2> @leith_aziz Yo doodGood doodDrool doodNuts mom0kaMythradab
[0:47:59] <%ChoculaUltra> oh thats cool
[0:48:08] <leith_aziz> Honestly? Bob is kinda cool but VERY one-note. He's not insulting but I felt like Goldlewis gave me everything I wanted out of a fat character
[0:48:23] <MidnightPacif1c> breakin the law
[0:48:26] <Blackenedcrustcynicism> Geras
[0:48:27] <+OmegaZeroX2> Geras
[0:48:28] <leith_aziz> Geras
[0:48:33] <+TopTieramisu> fem gaara
[0:48:34] <primaryfire> stream dropping frames for anyone else?
[0:48:34] <+UnrealStyrofoam> Grease
[0:48:46] <%ChoculaUltra> I liked Rufus from SF4 a lot for a "fat dude" fighter
[0:48:46] <RyuuAoi> I was thinking Mud subzero
[0:48:46] <leith_aziz> @OmegaZeroX2 : pickyFive1 pickyFive2
[0:48:56] <leith_aziz> Holy, I forgot about Gerras
[0:49:00] <+OmegaZeroX2> or Gaara doodLUL doodLUL doodLUL doodLUL
[0:49:01] <artoflec> @primaryfire yeah, peopel are saying its twitch but im not droppin anywhere else personally
[0:49:07] <primaryfire> ah okay
[0:49:09] <randominternetsurfer> @leith_aziz A low tier with 0 defensive options?
[0:49:14] <zenith0111> Special and Supers do so much in KoF
[0:49:15] <%pupil31> there was some dropped frames for me earlier
[0:49:20] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @leith_aziz That's actually true now that I think about it. Bob's funny but speed and weight get kinda old. Goldlewis being an absolute unit obsessed with UMAs and being the most metal Secretary of Defense is just icing on the cake.
[0:49:28] <%Juriasu> twitch is struggling but the stream seems better now that it did 20 minutes ago
[0:49:32] <this_guy_115> KOF LORE: Dolores was supposedly revived after Verse's death in 14, as she's considered a shaman
[0:49:36] <Blackenedcrustcynicism> Dolores is totally Geras and I felt Kukri had shades of Kanra from Killer Instinct but people thought I was crazy.
[0:49:46] <zenith0111> You got proximity normals
[0:49:56] <primaryfire> wild how snk got their hands on the bayonetta 4 design already
[0:50:01] <+TopTieramisu> dolores = geras + karin
[0:50:12] <BackwardCap> It goes EX command throw, EX pillars, EX anti air
[0:50:38] <+OmegaZeroX2> @primaryfire LUL LUL LUL LUL
[0:50:39] <Asuterisuku> Almost double the damage exactly.
[0:50:42] <%ChoculaUltra> hoping we get a few Garou reps in 15. Rock is the obvious one but Kain would wild.
[0:50:44] <leith_aziz> @leith_aziz Nailed it. He's just more well-rounded and fully realised in his personality (that was not an intended pun pickyAYAYA )
[0:50:58] <+TopTieramisu> i want gato
[0:51:12] <leith_aziz> @ChoculaUltra Wondeer if KoD would get a bird costume?
[0:51:28] <dweebenheimer20> @ChoculaUltra theres already a garou team, im guessiny you mean  motw team
[0:51:28] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1460530098050945027?s=20
[0:51:34] <seydaq> 4x3 this is not. ranges changed in the switch to hd
[0:51:48] <Shad0wTag> @leith_aziz I think its the fact that him being a fat guy isn't his entire gimmick. He's just small aspect and has nothing to do with his character
[0:51:48] <0cash> is it just me or the bgm piano is out of tune? its not bad, i just want to know
[0:51:51] <zenith0111> The usual ladder is Level 1 > Level 2 > Level3
[0:51:56] <+0neReeler> 6P
[0:52:01] <%ChoculaUltra> @dweebenheimer20 yeah, a Mark of the Wolves team
[0:52:04] <beatie_g> this mud is givng me flashbacks of fighting barroth in monhun
[0:52:21] <%ChoculaUltra> @leith_aziz oooo a Tizoc costume for KoD would be rad
[0:52:28] <TigerClaws12> you can still combo after
[0:52:31] <Asuterisuku> Stuffed
[0:52:36] <Thunderhog> I think that might've high profiled it
[0:52:37] <dweebenheimer20> @ChoculaUltra i think XI had one, so its possible
[0:52:57] <seydaq> welcome to kof spyCappa
[0:53:02] <leith_aziz> @Shad0wTag Yep. Thatt's how you make a fat character. NOT base their character around them being fat. There's more to it than that
[0:53:04] <zenith0111> OOF
[0:53:05] <Asuterisuku> Focus Attack vibes from that.
[0:53:24] <%ChoculaUltra> very Focus Attack vibes indeed
[0:53:26] <+0neReeler> no invul, armor/block point
[0:53:35] <TigerClaws12> holy
[0:53:39] <%ChoculaUltra> oh it can't tank a hit?
[0:53:39] <+TopTieramisu> bob has about as much depth of character as e honda or zangief
[0:53:42] <TigerClaws12> that's a BIG grab
[0:53:56] <zenith0111> Can be block it?
[0:53:59] <+TopTieramisu> e honda is sumo man and gief is wrestle man
[0:54:04] <Vinsfeld13> What about a hop?
[0:54:10] <Asuterisuku> It's a hitgrab
[0:54:11] <Vinsfeld13> Can it avoid the Climax?
[0:54:12] <leith_aziz> @TopTieramisu Sugar Punch has a video on Zangief if you're curious on what they can do with him
[0:54:22] <+TopTieramisu> @leith_aziz oh, i've seen it
[0:54:34] <leith_aziz> Nice pickyOkay
[0:54:35] <%Juriasu> Bodega?
[0:54:35] <+TopTieramisu> his vids are great
[0:54:38] <+RD_NX> Kyo is sick in this game
[0:54:43] <Asuterisuku> Classic fight right here.
[0:54:47] <leith_aziz> pickyFive1 pickyFive2
[0:54:52] <this_guy_115> NO PLAY YASHIRO AND CHRIS
[0:54:52] <seydaq> if clark still has his guard point and it works like shatter strike hes gonna be strong
[0:54:58] <+TopTieramisu> NESTS kyo is still my fav
[0:54:59] <Thunderhog> BODEGA
[0:55:04] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> ah, just noticed graffiti girl isn't in yet, sad
[0:55:23] <+OmegaZeroX2> doodmaxhype doodmaxhype doodmaxhype doodmaxhype
[0:55:24] <+Reverend_Roscoe> i can't wait to throw people around as Shermie
[0:55:28] <0cash> yes, ditch shun'ei reggie
[0:55:33] <leith_aziz> pickyVibing
[0:55:43] <seydaq> Taco got nerfed :|
[0:55:48] <this_guy_115> KOF FACT: For this game's rival battles, there's two remixed themes for kyo and iori each
[0:55:50] <+TopTieramisu> yoooooo
[0:55:53] <%CaptainPileDriver> this is definitely an snk game cause my god are super motion annoyingly strict
[0:55:56] <leith_aziz> The sound matching the footage would make it so much hype. Nott Woolie's fault though
[0:56:06] <+orochiblood> yes its a level 2
[0:56:14] <this_guy_115> Goodbye Esaka when against kyo and Sadistic Eyes when against Iori
[0:56:20] <%Juriasu> there's no audio desync for me
[0:56:26] <this_guy_115> LOOK AT THEIR NEOMAXES THO
[0:56:37] <Asuterisuku> 70% damage
[0:56:38] <%ChoculaUltra> oh that snap at the end is fucking dope
[0:56:39] <tacostarvedbeast> oh shi is this game out already?
[0:56:40] <Saltmeisterr> mmmmmmhhh
[0:56:42] <+TopTieramisu> i'm not digging the flame effect ngl
[0:56:44] <leith_aziz> @tacostarvedbeast Beta
[0:56:45] <Saltmeisterr> that bitrate
[0:56:46] <+rbakervv> @tacostarvedbeast open beta
[0:56:57] <leith_aziz> Oh I agree, the fire effects could use soem work
[0:56:59] <%ChoculaUltra> @TopTieramisu idk, it looks super cheap to me
[0:57:02] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @this_guy_115
[0:57:09] <Asuterisuku> Oh hey it tells you whether you're + or -
[0:57:17] <+TopTieramisu> @ChoculaUltra yeah
[0:57:22] <%ChoculaUltra> like not saying there isn't a budget in this game, but it comes off as mobile game graphics if that makes sense?
[0:57:26] <this_guy_115> Yeyeyeyeye
[0:57:33] <odd_slater> @this_guy_115 BRO WHY'D YOU YELL
[0:57:38] <seydaq> used to be quadruple fireball
[0:57:38] <%townzzzzz> that was a good super
[0:57:41] <Asuterisuku> ... Was that Orochi's voice?
[0:57:43] <+0neReeler> no more big scratch rip
[0:57:47] <TigerClaws12> Kyo's have way more oomph
[0:57:49] <+OmegaZeroX2> @asuterisuku yep
[0:57:51] <+orochiblood> they're quick supers to get back to the fight
[0:57:51] <Fdrank> that one is fine
[0:57:51] <leith_aziz> Iorio's scream made it enough
[0:57:52] <this_guy_115> Yes, it was Orochi's voice
[0:57:53] <%Josef_Stryker> His KOF14 super was cooler imo with the red screen
[0:57:56] <Fdrank> shunei's kind of sucks
[0:57:57] <nintega010> Yashiro is cool
[0:58:07] <+TopTieramisu> i wish they did the whole red screen with black silhouettes for iori like his HSDM from 2k2
[0:58:08] <+0neReeler> yashiro meme punch
[0:58:08] <%Juriasu> making a fighting game with 3d visuals after strive is ROUGH
[0:58:12] <+McSoliace> theres a lot more oomph when it ends the match
[0:58:12] <Asuterisuku> He doesn't have that weird between the legs strap anymore.
[0:58:13] <this_guy_115> His eyes also become red like when he enters the BloodRiot state
[0:58:16] <leith_aziz> My issue here is that im kinda done with training stages in fighting games ngl. You ALWAYS see them in tournaments
[0:58:22] <JetpackMcQuack> cool
[0:58:24] <Thunderhog> DOUBLE PLUS
[0:58:30] <zenith0111> Weird
[0:58:30] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:58:35] <zenith0111> Why not just numbers
[0:58:47] <Asuterisuku> Punch Planet has the best FD display.
[0:58:50] <nintega010> I'm ok with this
[0:58:51] <tolloponik> Numbers suck the fun out of it
[0:58:55] <%jinking79> the setting Max refused to turn on LUL
[0:59:01] <0cash> its a good step foward
[0:59:07] <leith_aziz> I think both would probably be best of both worlds, but I get it
[0:59:08] <stormhawk9891> @leith_aziz Same, I went against a LOT of people in this beta who instantly defaulted to training stage
[0:59:10] <@Menitta> did kyo always have jeans with the black jacket
[0:59:13] <nintega010> @jinking79 he always does that
[0:59:13] <+orochiblood> yeah Max was acting real weird last night, not sure what was up with him
[0:59:21] <seydaq> does training still have 1 guard jump chat?
[0:59:23] <@Menitta> because it looks great here
[0:59:27] <this_guy_115> KOF LORE: Chizuru recruited Kyo and Iori specifically to investigate the new KoF after finding out that the Orochi team is entering as well, due to them being revived thanks to Verse's death
[0:59:35] <beatie_g> can you cancel it off a combo?
[0:59:36] <TigerClaws12> @Menitta since nest kyo
[0:59:40] <+TopTieramisu> @Menitta kyo's first outfit was a school outfit with the kusanagi emblem. then he went to blue jeans, white jacket, and black shirt
[0:59:56] <+TopTieramisu> after nests it was a biker look
[0:59:56] <leith_aziz> @orochiblood He kept getting matches with a lot of lag
[0:59:57] <+McSoliace> cancel the sweep
[1:00:14] <zenith0111> @tolloponik Thats such a boomer take
[1:00:24] <this_guy_115> You can combo the fire sparks into his other super
[1:00:40] <this_guy_115> but not vice versa
[1:00:45] <leith_aziz> F?
[1:00:45] <%DomPressesButtons> OOOOOOOOOO
[1:00:45] <beatie_g> REEEEEEEEEEE
[1:00:51] <0cash> twitch died mid super for me
[1:00:53] <leith_aziz> Oh
[1:00:55] <zenith0111> OREEEE
[1:00:57] <Asuterisuku> Again, 70% damage
[1:00:58] <@Menitta> I cannot get over how much better this looks than XIV
[1:01:01] <+TopTieramisu> i was there when max turned on subscriber only chat LUL
[1:01:17] <+TopTieramisu> i don't care what he says, any air dash that affects your jump arc is good in kof
[1:01:17] <zenith0111> @asuterisuku Thats KoF damage for yeah. Spend bar for real damage
[1:01:28] <+McSoliace> maybe its just iori
[1:01:29] <this_guy_115> Again, its 3v3
[1:01:31] <%jinking79> tight inputs
[1:01:32] <zenith0111> Its very easy to just die in KoF
[1:01:39] <this_guy_115> matches have to go by pretty fast
[1:01:44] <+0neReeler> does the spark supers otg? his ex fireball does
[1:01:51] <this_guy_115> but also this is still with a LOT of meter
[1:01:54] <seydaq> @Asuterisuku for 5 bars it should be 95+
[1:01:56] <+chefframza> try Max mode
[1:02:00] <zenith0111> @this_guy_115 Theirs health regen for each character you take out
[1:02:16] <%DomPressesButtons> character specifics most likely
[1:02:21] <+TopTieramisu> that DM looks a lot like kyo's hcb k(?) from kof 99
[1:02:32] <+0neReeler> 5 meters so anchor matches are touch of death game
[1:02:34] <+TopTieramisu> or was it actually just his DM in 99
[1:02:42] <leith_aziz> I love how Iori's sweeep is just him throwing hiis entire body forward on the ground
[1:02:59] <+TopTieramisu> iori's sweep is so high, it can anti-air
[1:03:07] <nintega010> @this_guy_115 honestly I hope matches go quicker cause matches in KoF take forever
[1:03:08] <%AlteisenReiseZ> sweep shin-sho? BRING INT BACK
[1:03:17] <leith_aziz> @TopTieramisu So it's like Leo's sweep? pickyAYAYA
[1:03:29] <Asuterisuku> His rekkas look complicated.
[1:03:40] <zenith0111> Whats KoF default timer?
[1:03:42] <+0neReeler> a real grab
[1:03:48] <Haarute> kyo is now a grappler
[1:03:51] <+TopTieramisu> well he has kototsuki yo, which NESTS kyo didn't have
[1:03:54] <0cash> thats cool
[1:03:59] <TigerClaws12> Sol gaming
[1:04:00] <leith_aziz> MORIOH!
[1:04:05] <leith_aziz> pickyYareYare
[1:04:35] <+slayabee> grab is an ender
[1:04:48] <+TopTieramisu> nests kyo had that twirly punch move that kinda reminds me of cammy's spinning backfist
[1:04:56] <+TopTieramisu> except it was like a close upper
[1:04:57] <seydaq> @zenith0111 90 sec
[1:05:12] <brunoberserk> wait this is iori theme from kof 99 , nice

[1:07:10] <seydaq> @orochiblood That seems to happen every new gen NotLikeThis
[1:07:17] <Who_lio42> fair
[1:07:24] <+0neReeler> @Who_lio42 think that's the same for most cross games
[1:07:29] <odd_slater> We gotta beat up moobot
[1:07:45] <+orochiblood> I spent all this money on a new console and I gotta play the PS4 versions of games to use periphels.
[1:08:04] <brunoberserk> maybe the EX moves can ?
[1:08:05] <Who_lio42> no special to special like SVC Chaos.
[1:08:06] <+0neReeler> don't think so? just ex moves in max
[1:08:06] <TigerClaws12> you can EX  specials into EX
[1:08:10] <+Ultimate_Edge> Nah. Now max mode just lets you spend max meter on ex moves for the Max mode combos
[1:08:44] <this_guy_115> moobot pls

[1:10:43] <Who_lio42> i hope so. O.Yashiro is the only reason i care hes back
[1:10:56] <+orochiblood> Base Yashiro is still pretty fun though
[1:10:58] <leith_aziz> I feel like Japan somehow has like 3 english announcers only? This guy's been in marketing for Tekken 7, Strive (some trailers and the Jack-O starter guide) and now KOF XV
[1:11:03] <beatie_g> yo that sped up GIF of a band in the back tho
[1:11:16] <brunoberserk> thas a JOJO
[1:11:20] <+TopTieramisu> both yashiros are dope
[1:11:29] <+orochiblood> Mountain Dew Shun
[1:11:30] <+TopTieramisu> that's a woolie shun'ei
[1:11:35] <leith_aziz> Huh, this color of Shunei flows much better
[1:11:35] <beatie_g> WAY more drip already
[1:11:49] <seydaq> in woolie colours for the insult LUL
[1:11:54] <+orochiblood> I like how all of Shunei's re-colors are way better than the main.
[1:12:03] <Who_lio42> Limewire Shunei
[1:12:08] <+TopTieramisu> nests kyo baby
[1:12:11] <leith_aziz> Drip Kyo

[1:12:18] <seydaq> mountain dew shunei
[1:12:21] <%Juriasu> white jacket Kyo Kreygasm
[1:12:22] <Super_Voltekka> Isn't it really sad that a character can look much cooler if their alts were the default instead?
[1:12:46] <Hessman212> all of Shun'ei's alt colors fix his design b quite  a bit
[1:12:46] <Who_lio42> gimme Kusanagi, not Kyo
[1:12:46] <%CaptainPileDriver> i swear to god if another person 1 and dones me in this fucking network test
[1:12:47] <leith_aziz> @Super_Voltekka To be fair, that's been the case for soem characters in fighting games, even other genres
[1:12:49] <+orochiblood> @Super_Voltekka they released beta concept art for Shunei in 14 and the beta concepts looked much better
[1:12:55] <brunoberserk> i feel that you can easily ''fix'' shun ei design with some feel touches , change some colors , etc.
[1:13:00] <this_guy_115> This and the Metal slug stage will be my favrotir stages in the game
[1:13:00] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts

[1:15:03] <+TopTieramisu> every smash move is chargeable
[1:15:16] <DSD24> Dolores looks so cool
[1:15:21] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @toptieramisu you mean Reggie?
[1:15:28] <+TopTieramisu> @Reverend_Roscoe .... fuck
[1:15:31] <+Reverend_Roscoe> lol
[1:15:50] <leith_aziz> Woolie's acting like those players who play against an Akuma player in T7, gets focus attacked, then losses all his health
[1:15:55] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @toptieramisu Reggie actually likes Smash though
[1:16:01] <+tigerstyle96> Stream exploding for anyone else?

[1:16:11] <+OroOreo> my stream is in the process of dying

[1:16:20] <seydaq> cmon reggie you got a jump cd enbSun
[1:16:21] <+TopTieramisu> @Reverend_Roscoe was just a joke because of reggie's ptsd with galactica phantom-likes
[1:16:24] <DSD24> Oh so its not just me?
[1:16:25] <%Juriasu> the animation for the band in the back is nuts

[1:16:47] <%HeroToxiko> hit em up with the alex mack
[1:16:47] <%CaptainPileDriver> i hate these chodes who i play one game then leave
[1:16:48] <enddword> !bitrate
[1:16:50] <+Ultimate_Edge> rough*
[1:16:52] <leith_aziz> Twitch is lagging like it's delay based netcode
[1:16:54] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> mad skipping, low bitrate, delayed audio AND SHE'S STILL A QUEEN
[1:16:54] <+orochiblood> @Juriasu if you play on PS5, the background wrestlers on the wrestling stage at least have a better framerate
[1:17:23] <this_guy_115> I don't think anyone but third strike can beat KoF's entire music, each game literally has a different theme for each team!
[1:17:27] <+TopTieramisu> i wish shun'ei's ghost hands were color customizable
[1:17:35] <+TopTieramisu> stand hands?
[1:17:47] <Who_lio42> sthands
[1:18:00] <this_guy_115> Intro's only occur during story mode
[1:18:09] <leith_aziz> @this_guy_115 I have preferences of course (GG music is my fave), but KOF's OST is really good. Iori's themes pickyVibing
[1:18:18] <essence_of_lariatto> team orochi has speacial intros
[1:18:20] <brunoberserk> BODY GA , AMEZE
[1:18:23] <+kewlmyc> The music changes with Iori vs Kyo at least. Same with Yashiro vs Iori
[1:18:35] <odd_slater> It always takes me awhile to learn stuff in game with link combos as opposed to light, medium, heavy type combos
[1:18:40] <this_guy_115> woolie......he already had it....
[1:18:43] <Asuterisuku> "But mom, the monkey has a command grab!"
[1:18:50] <nintega010> he had it in 14
[1:18:51] <this_guy_115> He's had it since 96.....
[1:18:52] <leith_aziz> Me who plays Sol: Nah pickySmug
[1:18:53] <seydaq> already had em
[1:18:56] <Who_lio42> he used to have a super grab, so its not too farfetched
[1:19:00] <+0neReeler> still no sol
[1:19:06] <+TopTieramisu> kyo's command grab HSDM in 2k2 was the dopest
[1:19:10] <+orochiblood> PRO CHRIS
[1:19:37] <+TopTieramisu> and iori, kyo's rival, has had a command grab forever
[1:19:40] <seydaq> @orochiblood chenLogic
[1:19:48] <%Naedtgio> Naedtgio subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[1:19:50] <leith_aziz> @odd_slater Funny thing, I find it easier to play Arcsys games because of how buttons work instead of SF's specific link timings
[1:19:57] <DSD24> Is Chris moonwalking?
[1:19:59] <brunoberserk> KOF was always kinda crazy with the command grabs , in KOF 97 almost every char got a new command grab
[1:20:18] <this_guy_115> @dsd24 Yes, he's always moonwalked when moving away from an opponent
[1:20:19] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1460530098050945027?s=20
[1:20:28] <DSD24> @this_guy_115 That's awesome!
[1:20:28] <+orochiblood> Ive never seen someone use Shunei's default colors in a match lmao
[1:20:36] <BlackermanZX> kyo looks amazing but its kinda weird that they changed RED Kick's input
[1:20:54] <+TopTieramisu> what's RED kick's input now?
[1:21:10] <this_guy_115> still the same

[1:21:37] <bennythejet504> I think this looks pretty good just needs some tightening in certain areas
[1:21:38] <seydaq> they added an extra 4 input
[1:21:45] <+Ultimate_Edge> And it has to be 4214k. It won't also take backward dp as good enough
[1:21:53] <sweetkek> Were expectations shattered?

[1:34:28] <Asuterisuku> @taeko_ohnuki Because he's the second character.

[1:34:31] <+Reverend_Roscoe> ! BIRATE AT RISK!

[1:36:59] <+kewlmyc> One sided rollback according to some, but they have time to fix it.
[1:37:00] <seydaq> @balouie end of 14
[1:37:02] <+Ryukenxx1> Netcode needs some iorning out, when it works it works though
[1:37:03] <%CaptainPileDriver> that's for single
[1:37:04] <OldManDeckardCain> the netcode seems worse than melty at least so far

[1:49:15] <%livlinn> Gorgeous joofbBlush
[1:49:25] <%JohnMcClanesBrother> JohnMcClanesBrother subscribed at Tier 1. 
[1:49:48] <%JohnMcClanesBrother> Its crazy ive been watching Woolie do stuff for more than 10 years. Glad to be able to support now
[1:49:48] <%CaptainPileDriver> the room number is 829163
[1:49:57] <+TopTieramisu> not surprised that vibrant colors work well on her skin complexion
[1:50:05] <%CaptainPileDriver> you type that into the search for room then go up and select search room
[1:50:12] <Asuterisuku> We can still hear...
[1:50:51] <%CaptainPileDriver> jesus
[1:50:57] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> man things are wonky today
[1:51:00] <%CaptainPileDriver> the audio for us is also being wonky
[1:51:03] <+orochiblood> thats the point of a network beta
[1:51:11] <+orochiblood> Man im so glad they delayed this game
[1:51:25] <+TopTieramisu> is yashiro's standing B a beast of a poking tool?
[1:51:27] <%CaptainPileDriver> yeah, this need the delay for sure, let it cook a bit longer
[1:51:30] <+TopTieramisu> still a*
[1:51:33] <OldManDeckardCain> tbh they need to delay it for a few more months
[1:51:35] <%CaptainPileDriver> make it a fine ass meal
[1:51:45] <%CaptainPileDriver> 829163 is the room code btw
[1:51:47] <+kewlmyc> Some of the sound effects don't play due to the rollback for some reason. There's a reason they're doing an online beta
[1:51:53] <+TopTieramisu> oh boy
[1:51:54] <xUrbanCarnage> Nice
[1:52:00] <%CaptainPileDriver> @JohnnyContra you can leave
[1:52:03] <+kewlmyc> @JohnnyContra fuck off dude
[1:52:04] <+TopTieramisu> someone needs a time out
[1:52:12] <Asuterisuku> No more thumb callous
[1:52:17] <Vendigear> mod check? rooCheck
[1:52:25] <+TopTieramisu> mods asleep
[1:52:27] <%wolfofsound> @JohnnyContra ????????
[1:52:32] <%CaptainPileDriver> 829163 is once againroom code
[1:52:47] <artoflec> @OldManDeckardCain hard to say since the game is coming out in 3 months as is, like, we're IN the beta, 3 months will feel like a while away
[1:52:51] <+orochiblood> Mods?
[1:52:51] <%CaptainPileDriver> @JohnnyContra dude just leave. you wanna be a prick go away.
[1:52:54] <+orochiblood> Modcheck?
[1:52:58] <Asuterisuku> Mods
[1:53:01] <Leonheart777> mods in all in the bathroo9m at same time
[1:53:01] <xUrbanCarnage> @johnnycontra yeah I remember but is this really the time for that? Also that deal never went through so
[1:53:01] <Vendigear> rooCheck rooCheck rooCheck
[1:53:33] <halfmasks> man this game audio sounds kinda weird
[1:53:35] <OldManDeckardCain> @artoflec I hope that's the case
[1:53:35] <%CaptainPileDriver> @xUrbanCarnage it's almost like he did 0 research but still wanted to compain
[1:53:43] <%CaptainPileDriver> *complain*
[1:53:49] <BlackermanZX> damn chizuru in black looks cool
[1:53:50] <Vendigear> wait, did the deal not go through?
[1:54:04] <Shad0wTag> Chizuru animates really well, anyone else agree?
[1:54:05] <xUrbanCarnage> people are enjoying a game that innocent people worked on
[1:54:06] <Asuterisuku> They do currently own 33% of the company.
[1:54:11] <afronooch> dude was being a compain, so that still works @CaptainPileDriver
[1:54:13] <Asuterisuku> It's still too much.
[1:54:16] <%jinking79> yeah sounds effects dropping too
[1:54:20] <@Menitta> Aw jeez
[1:54:22] <BlackermanZX> shunei with the monster energy colors
[1:54:27] <xUrbanCarnage> @vendigear I believe it didn‚Äôt go through completely yet but it might
[1:54:34] <+orochiblood> @Asuterisuku ye they also own a bunch of stock in EA/Riot/Activision and Rockstar
[1:54:43] <LoveXKnife> koffies
[1:54:45] <Asuterisuku> @orochiblood Guess who else I don't buy from.
[1:54:46] <+TopTieramisu> no ethical consumption under etc etc
[1:54:54] <Vendigear> aw, man. am I gonna hafta do MY OWN RESEARCH rooMadslam
[1:54:59] <xUrbanCarnage> But even then the devs of this game have nothing to do with that
[1:55:04] <RyuuAoi> @asuterisuku Rockstar?
[1:55:10] <Vendigear> chats not gonna spoonfeed me rooMadslam
[1:55:14] <+kewlmyc> Double Scream
[1:55:14] <+orochiblood> ye I doubt the devs have any say in stockholder meetings
[1:55:15] <@Menitta> let's just move on from that
[1:55:18] <Asuterisuku> If you answered _literally all of those,_ you're right.
[1:55:37] <+Ryukenxx1> Rather this be weird now then at release
[1:55:37] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:55:49] <Vendigear> !MOTIVATED
[1:55:49] <@Moobot> @Vendigear 2379 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[1:55:49] <+orochiblood> yeah this game comes out mid Feburary, seems like enough time
[1:56:10] <%wolfofsound> TY woolie
[1:56:11] <Vendigear> sounds good
[1:56:14] <+TopTieramisu> don't worry. it was just one dude
[1:56:22] <xUrbanCarnage> Thank you Woolie
[1:56:26] <BlackermanZX> Juan Guy of course
[1:56:30] <+kewlmyc> It was one guy being an absolute fucking idiot.
[1:56:31] <+orochiblood> One Guy'd
[1:56:34] <RyuuAoi> FUCK THE CODE
[1:56:35] <Vendigear> ...I don't know how to do that koefKoepium
[1:56:36] <%livlinn> woolieONEGUY
[1:56:37] <%CaptainPileDriver> one dude wanted to come in and be the "society guy"
[1:56:50] <vergil_angelo> better to have the netcode be implemented now than to try and rig it into being rollback, but here‚Äôs hoping these things get fixed up
[1:56:52] <Shad0wTag> It's wild to think KOF14 came before this, this game looks a lot better
[1:56:58] <RyuuAoi> @vendigear You will figure it out
[1:57:01] <Kurt_0> Yikes
[1:57:03] <+TopTieramisu> kof14 did an MK11
[1:57:13] <seydaq> verse the dahaka
[1:57:18] <xUrbanCarnage> Fuck one guy, these yashiro combos tho
[1:57:18] <Ramasama13> except for geese, he never died even when he did
[1:57:19] <zk_nails> that Geese booty is back
[1:57:22] <%Qsmash_> characters being dead is a good reason why they shouldn't be playable :)
[1:57:26] <DSD24> All your fav-SHERMIE are back
[1:57:26] <@Menitta> is Rugal back
[1:57:32] <%CaptainPileDriver> shermie is queen
[1:57:32] <+Tajy_Venom> @WoolieVersus Ash shouldn't have come back though. He erased himself from the timeline rather than being dead.
[1:57:36] <%CaptainPileDriver> cruch my head with them cheeks
[1:57:38] <+kewlmyc> So far, only CYS is confirmed alive. Hopefully Rugal is back too.
[1:57:40] <%jinking79> he had all there souls and got defeated and released them
[1:57:42] <gridib> Kreygasm
[1:57:44] <+Ryukenxx1> I kinds respect that they will just kil la fan favorite, it makes the reverance even greater
[1:57:46] <xUrbanCarnage> Shermie got a complete wagon
[1:57:46] <+TopTieramisu> geese never died in the kof universe ü§∑
[1:57:48] <+kewlmyc> OH yeah, and Ash too
[1:57:49] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> we can move forward...but that ass got a gravitational pull
[1:57:53] <zenith0111> GRAB ME MOMMY
[1:58:02] <%livlinn> woolieSMUG
[1:58:02] <BlackermanZX> cant deny the shermie booty kolBIGBotan kolMagma
[1:58:02] <primaryfire> wish he stayed erased
[1:58:02] <LordOfThePoultry> LUL
[1:58:03] <xUrbanCarnage> Pls Angel tho
[1:58:05] <DSD24> God damn it
[1:58:07] <vergil_angelo> It‚Äôs implied that all the old final bosses, and even Leona‚Äôs dead dad are coming back
[1:58:08] <Super_Voltekka> Weren't Mature and Vice in XIII supposed to be literal ghosts haunting Iori for his transgressions?
[1:58:11] <+orochiblood> "I will never be a memory..'
[1:58:13] <seydaq> Kukri fixed the ash problem
[1:58:15] <BackwardCap> Roster death sucks tho gildedDerp
[1:58:16] <zenith0111> Wuy
[1:58:18] <%CaptainPileDriver> ash crimson got them DSL
[1:58:21] <%Josef_Stryker> Wait are Vice and Mature properly alive now?
[1:58:21] <+TopTieramisu> "i will never be just a memory" -ash
[1:58:21] <zenith0111> Thats lore?
[1:58:22] <LoveXKnife> we love ash
[1:58:23] <artoflec> yeah im pretty sure mature and vice aren't even physical beings anymore but whatever LUL
[1:58:24] <@Menitta> I'm pro Ash
[1:58:36] <+kewlmyc> Yeah, Mature and Vice have been LITERAL GHOST for the past two games. Death was always nothing.
[1:58:36] <+Ultimate_Edge> Ash is alright
[1:58:36] <+TopTieramisu> i used to be anti-ash. but then i saw shun'ei
[1:58:37] <+orochiblood> alot of Ash hate comes from homophobia unfortunately
[1:58:39] <@Menitta> I don't really get why people hate Ash lol
[1:58:39] <%jinking79> just Fix Ash's Lips in this Game man
[1:58:42] <LoveXKnife> ash was ahead of his time, femboy before femboy trend
[1:58:42] <%Qsmash_> I like Ash
[1:58:43] <primaryfire> I wanna shove him in a locker
[1:58:52] <vergil_angelo> Character death wasn‚Äôt as crippling as it was when SNK wasn‚Äôt bankrupt
[1:58:57] <artoflec> whaddaya mean fix ash's lips they look luscious
[1:58:59] <kaptain_marty> hes cool
[1:58:59] <+kewlmyc> Ash is a fun femboy
[1:58:59] <Asuterisuku> Ash is the heel you're supposed to hate.
[1:59:10] <%wolfofsound> "Why aren't you booing me? I'm wrong!"
[1:59:11] <+Ryukenxx1> Nah leave Ash's lips, got those DSL's
[1:59:12] <%CaptainPileDriver> nothing will ever be as bad as ingrid.
[1:59:12] <BackwardCap> Ash got big lips
[1:59:16] <%CaptainPileDriver> so ash is fine
[1:59:17] <RyuuAoi> Woolie, play quick session of 3rd Strike next?
[1:59:27] <seydaq> @wolfofsound LUL
[1:59:32] <+TopTieramisu> ash's new outfit is also nicer than his original
[1:59:32] <primaryfire> what that mouth do tho
[1:59:54] <vergil_angelo> but the fact that XIII was built to end Ash‚Äôs saga only for XIV‚Äôs plot to bring him back
[1:59:57] <Haarute> chizuru mirror mirror match
[1:59:59] <+kewlmyc> Still don't get the hatred for Ingrid considering she was in like one game
[1:59:59] <SpookyMooks> hoo boy chunky frames
[2:00:01] <RyuuAoi> Reggie never played 3rd Strike.
[2:00:04] <vergil_angelo> also Ash, Remy, and Freeman are the same guy
[2:00:06] <artoflec> chizuru is cool
[2:00:14] <%CaptainPileDriver> all that matters is that king of dinosaurs is back
[2:00:21] <RyuuAoi> See!
[2:00:24] <Udongein_1> love that chizuru is a biker too
[2:00:25] <+orochiblood> There seems to be a problem if one player has a PS5 and one has a PS4, crossplay doesnt seem to work well
[2:00:26] <+TopTieramisu> freeman is more like flame-less iori
[2:00:34] <gridib> Nurses from Dong Dong
[2:00:34] <Asuterisuku> Blazblue's Makoto
[2:00:38] <%jinking79> krillin
[2:00:41] <+kewlmyc> Just give me K' and Kula and I'll be satisfied. 1/2 so far.
[2:00:43] <OldManDeckardCain> speaking of 3S, did woolie hear that pat has finally admitted he is over fighting games (except for 3S) LUL
[2:00:44] <%Qsmash_> Naruto...
[2:00:48] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Makoto from Blazblue
[2:00:54] <%CaptainPileDriver> ssg gogeta
[2:00:58] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Faust
[2:01:00] <Super_Voltekka> Hanzo has one too
[2:01:03] <TheDrown> Murakumo from Blitzkampf
[2:01:07] <%CaptainPileDriver> he has the 3 clones
[2:01:13] <Super_Voltekka> If you hit the wrong one, you trigger a bomb
[2:01:17] <Shad0wTag> Afterimages are always cool
[2:01:32] <Shad0wTag> @oldmandeckardcain surprise to no one
[2:01:39] <%CaptainPileDriver> i mean chipp also does his ninja stuff
[2:01:47] <Asuterisuku> That was not the time to be spending meter.
[2:01:51] <OldManDeckardCain> @Shad0wTag yeah, but he actually admitted it now LUL
[2:01:52] <+TopTieramisu> dirty netcode
[2:02:03] <@Menitta> oh God that iori color
[2:02:05] <Shad0wTag> Woolz so crossplay rollback isn't great apparently
[2:02:15] <+kewlmyc> Hopefully they fix it. They have like 3 months to do so.
[2:02:18] <Shad0wTag> PS4 to PS5 isn't cracking
[2:02:19] <%Juriasu> SourPls
[2:02:20] <+TopTieramisu> it's ok to be done with fighters as you get older. even aris is done with online fighting games
[2:02:22] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @RyuuAoi
[2:02:22] <+orochiblood> PS5 and PS4 dont play nice with each other
[2:02:30] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus i was on my ps4
[2:02:35] <%CaptainPileDriver> base ps4 btw
[2:02:37] <@Menitta> ooooh that makes sense
[2:02:37] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:02:40] <%CaptainPileDriver> not the pro
[2:02:40] <Blackenedcrustcynicism> It does not cross-play well with one another.
[2:02:40] <+Ultimate_Edge> I was on PS5
[2:02:46] <@Menitta> I need to install on ps5
[2:02:49] <Vendigear> is there an option to turn off crossplay altogether?
[2:02:51] <+orochiblood> what is this Yashiro color btw
[2:03:04] <Blackenedcrustcynicism> The loading times between EVEN PS4 Base / PS4 Pro / PS5 are vastly different.
[2:03:05] <%Juriasu> this match looks really smooth
[2:03:10] <%CaptainPileDriver> ps4 base console
[2:03:11] <zenotronzx99> It runs better on PS4. I have a regular PS4 and it apparently runs better than the Pro version.
[2:03:14] <%jinking79> didn't see the ps4 ver on pa5 store
[2:03:16] <Shad0wTag> However this game is multiplat bar switch, and oh lord can you imagine Woolz if its bad
[2:03:27] <Asuterisuku> "Botched"
[2:03:31] <%Juriasu> PLANNED
[2:03:33] <vergil_angelo> This game might not have full cross play
[2:03:36] <+FoxLex_> I'm on PS4
[2:03:41] <vergil_angelo> so it‚Äôs hard to say
[2:03:42] <+FoxLex_> And I got no rollback
[2:03:42] <+TopTieramisu> another thing. yashiro's shoulder pads are similar to dmc5 nero's
[2:03:44] <seydaq> Canadian resets
[2:03:51] <+TopTieramisu> that plus his face and hair
[2:03:59] <Asuterisuku> Yellow Card?
[2:04:05] <+OroOreo> When that combo is not a real combo but when combo it‚Äôs still a combo. Do you understand?
[2:04:08] <RyuuAoi> #whoa, you're good!
[2:04:14] <%jinking79> card mean warnings
[2:04:26] <+FoxLex_> So confirmed, PS4 runs the best right now
[2:04:40] <+FoxLex_> Vanilla PS4 I should say
[2:04:55] <SpookyMooks> because "reasons"
[2:04:57] <RyuuAoi> We do it. We having fun
[2:05:00] <DSD24> Like Nelson in KOF14
[2:05:01] <+TopTieramisu> form over function
[2:05:01] <%wolfofsound> @FoxLex_ probably they are more used to the hardware maybe?
[2:05:23] <+kewlmyc> Love that Chizuru color
[2:05:25] <Super_Voltekka> HASTA LA VISTA
[2:05:29] <RedCycloneInc> luchados are the homies
[2:05:30] <%CaptainPileDriver> MEXICAN BOXERS ARE SUPER HUMAN
[2:05:30] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[2:05:33] <+FoxLex_> It's just bug stuff
[2:05:34] <%RyTYoung> LUL
[2:05:37] <%cobalt_phoenix_> hell yea
[2:05:42] <+TopTieramisu> mexican boxers have unreadable jabs
[2:05:43] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Call in the El Fuerte assist
[2:05:44] <seydaq> its their nippon ich
[2:05:46] <%CaptainPileDriver> ippo fucking LOVES mexican boxers, they are the ultimate life forms of boxing
[2:05:48] <Shad0wTag> is that fucking true
[2:05:56] <+FoxLex_> The PS4 Pro and PS5 are having problems with rollback but the PS4 isnt
[2:06:03] <OldManDeckardCain> but can mexican boxers beat wally tho Kappa
[2:06:04] <+Ultimate_Edge> Yeah they really needed this beta. You can tell
[2:06:09] <+TopTieramisu> @CaptainPileDriver except for takamura, who is OP af
[2:06:10] <RyuuAoi> Woolie, are you boxing again?
[2:06:11] <+FoxLex_> So you might need to hook up the PS4 woolie
[2:06:11] <%CaptainPileDriver> yeah on my base ps4 al the matches are smooth
[2:06:18] <+TopTieramisu> takamura is so broken, it pisses me off
[2:06:20] <seydaq> @FoxLex_ most dev time probably
[2:06:41] <+FoxLex_> Well they had time with the Pro alreast
[2:06:46] <%CaptainPileDriver> i'm fine with takamura being op cause that's the point, i love it, he beat a bear while at his lowest weight class
[2:06:50] <+FoxLex_> But not with using GGPO
[2:06:56] <Shad0wTag> This seems to br running better
[2:07:01] <%wolfofsound> am I the only on hearing him say "yeet" when he goes for that kick?
[2:07:02] <%CaptainPileDriver> always remember, takamura beat a bear in a fist fight
[2:07:06] <%wolfofsound> one*
[2:07:07] <+TopTieramisu> i wish takamura fell in a tragic way at some point. he's hogging up too much of the story imo
[2:07:12] <%Qsmash_> I guess it is crossplay then
[2:07:15] <OblivionSword1> so yeah crossplay might be an issue right now
[2:07:23] <+TopTieramisu> they hinted at takamura having some eye trouble a long time ago and went nowhere with it
[2:07:28] <BlackermanZX> Still waiting for Ippo to comeback
[2:07:34] <%CaptainPileDriver> @TopTieramisu he's hogging it cause we're still waiting for ippo to finally get back in the fucking ring
[2:07:37] <+FoxLex_> Seems like PS5 vs PS5 or Pro vs Pro work fine but the moment a PS4 enters, things get wild
[2:07:58] <+TopTieramisu> @CaptainPileDriver both problems that aren't necessarily connected
[2:08:22] <+TopTieramisu> now they got ricardo martinez fighting the worst character introduced in ippo LUL
[2:08:22] <RyuuAoi> Edge cleaning up!
[2:08:57] <OldManDeckardCain> @TopTieramisu what do you mean, wally is the hypest character Kappa
[2:08:58] <%DreamCancel01> lacPls lacPls lacPls
[2:09:12] <RyuuAoi> Atta girl
[2:09:18] <%CaptainPileDriver> @TopTieramisu well, takamura told him he has to become a monster to get back in the ring and showed ippo that while becoming a monster to show him and try to get him to get back in that ring
[2:09:20] <+kewlmyc> Bloody SourPls
[2:09:23] <Dova573> Salty im stuck at work
[2:09:43] <+Ultimate_Edge> Ggs. I wish the netcode worked like Strive's though LUL
[2:09:44] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:09:45] <Dova573> I would love to tick command grab reggie again
[2:09:49] <+TopTieramisu> ippo's been stagnating long before he ever retired. if anything, the story got better after he retired
[2:09:52] <RyuuAoi> Run that again, Woolie
[2:10:00] <+TopTieramisu> the worst stretch was when ippo was fighting all these other asian champs
[2:10:07] <+TopTieramisu> wally and gedo
[2:10:20] <+TopTieramisu> and geromichi
[2:10:30] <+TopTieramisu> and that one dude that got knocked out in one punch
[2:10:31] <Dova573> btw can we agreee that Dolores its a stand user?
[2:10:37] <PerfectDare> pick your next move, what's it gonna be?
[2:10:38] <theredfox930000> woolie is kof15 atpDance atpDance majinoNeko majinoNeko spookyRain spookyDolphin kbsBuran nextemoteHibrad
[2:10:47] <@Menitta> or even for defense
[2:11:01] <krin_x> oh shes a jojo all the way
[2:11:28] <+TopTieramisu> i like that chizuru has a twin that's even stronger
[2:11:38] <+kewlmyc> @Dova573 Stand [OUT THE MUD]
[2:11:39] <%CaptainPileDriver> wally was fun at the least
[2:12:13] <+TopTieramisu> wally was not fun imo
[2:12:16] <seydaq> @Dova573 or muddy waters
[2:12:41] <+TopTieramisu> wally is a genius so he somehow is a shang tsung of all the moves we saw in the series
[2:13:00] <+TopTieramisu> also, he bounces off of ropes and breaks physics like the worst character in ashita no joe, harimau
[2:13:16] <%jinking79> second off
[2:13:38] <xUrbanCarnage> @toptieramisu is that the dude that looks like blanka?

[2:14:26] <%brisk_dacat> Give yourself a stranger??
[2:14:41] <%CaptainPileDriver> @TopTieramisu considering this is the series that has a lot of homophobia and does blackface for a joke, i mean. nothing really surprises me
[2:15:00] <+TopTieramisu> was there blackface in ashita no joe?
[2:15:03] <+TopTieramisu> i don't remember that
[2:15:06] <voodoolawyer> blackface install?
[2:15:11] <%wolfofsound> @brisk_dacat it's when you make your hand go numb and do your business like it's somebody else's hand
[2:15:16] <xUrbanCarnage> 80s mangaka bruv
[2:15:18] <%CaptainPileDriver> @TopTieramisu i'm talking about ippo
[2:15:23] <xUrbanCarnage> Or 70s
[2:15:28] <+TopTieramisu> i'm saying harimau is a super racist character LUL
[2:15:33] <+Ultimate_Edge> AWW He dropped it
[2:15:34] <basitsnake> @CaptainPileDriver ae you referring to the army guy ?
[2:15:37] <+TopTieramisu> though wally is also pretty racist
[2:15:40] <dmtjinni> LUL
[2:15:41] <BlackermanZX> botched

[2:15:52] <%jinking79> Yashiro casual 50% one bar

[2:16:06] <basitsnake> Ozuma i believe
[2:16:07] <%brisk_dacat> @wolfofsound  .... Why would anyone??
[2:16:15] <%CaptainPileDriver> @basitsnake no, i'm talking about how when ippo had to fight a black guy they made aoki dress up in blackface
[2:16:21] <basitsnake> @Menitta only 2 teams
[2:16:23] <%wolfofsound> @brisk_dacat Dunno man people get desperate
[2:16:25] <xUrbanCarnage> Praying for Angel to come back

[2:17:35] <krin_x> yeah
[2:17:36] <%jinking79> yes
[2:17:38] <Shad0wTag> yes
[2:17:43] <+balouie> yes
[2:17:43] <%CaptainPileDriver> seems like it
[2:17:44] <+kewlmyc> Everyone is, streaming or not streaming
[2:17:48] <DSD24> I know Max had them when he was streaming KOF
[2:17:49] <rufus2k2> thank god it's a beta
[2:17:52] <xUrbanCarnage> That‚Äôs just the game in general
[2:17:59] <%Tearonex> looks like a Beta thing
[2:18:01] <TigerClaws12> diaphone got hit with it every match
[2:18:06] <+TopTieramisu> has there been any other games that have this kind of sound hiccup?
[2:18:09] <%jinking79> hear the death cry but there still alive
[2:18:11] <%Juriasu> is the game syncing past tye sound triggers?
[2:18:12] <@Menitta> this was a needed beta it seems
[2:18:16] <@Menitta> for network
[2:18:23] <+kewlmyc> It's the netcode in general right now
[2:18:27] <TigerClaws12> think SFxT LUL
[2:18:36] <xUrbanCarnage> I mean online rollback
[2:18:38] <Shad0wTag> @menitta especially with the ps4 and ps5 crossplay issues
[2:18:39] <xUrbanCarnage> My bad
[2:18:39] <%wolfofsound> yeah still have time to fix it
[2:18:39] <%jinking79> 4 months away
[2:18:53] <Asuterisuku> SFxT had good online though.
[2:19:05] <%DomPressesButtons> apparently ggpo?
[2:19:18] <Super_Voltekka> HELLZONE GRENADE
[2:19:29] <@Menitta> that's how you get SFV
[2:19:29] <Shad0wTag> @asuterisuku super early GGPO from Capcom if I recall
[2:19:48] <+Ultimate_Edge> The problem is convincing devs to use something that isn't made by them
[2:20:06] <%CaptainPileDriver> and tekken's.
[2:20:09] <Shad0wTag> @ultimate_edge JP devs especially
[2:20:12] <%CaptainPileDriver> tekken's is so bad.
[2:20:14] <DSD24> Or Virtua Fighter?
[2:20:17] <BlackermanZX> yeah but remember some devs are dinosaurs
[2:20:20] <zk_nails> tekken is 3
[2:20:23] <+kewlmyc> Well they are using GGPO, but god knows who implemented it specifically
[2:20:25] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> tekken is 3
[2:20:36] <%CaptainPileDriver> @DSD24 virtua fighter is actually delaybased with wierd things, max did a video on it
[2:20:40] <karismaticprik> isn't this game running on GGPO?
[2:20:45] <@Menitta> Tekken also has the problem of being 3D but I'm sure it can be solved
[2:20:50] <DSD24> @CaptainPileDriver Oh ok I need to watch that then
[2:20:50] <Shad0wTag> @captainpiledriver super expensive google servers
[2:20:52] <+DeaconBluesClues> @WoolieVersus what they need is a "rollback company" where it's run by westerners but the lead "face" of the company is omse older japanese guy who japanese devs will find "trustworthy"
[2:20:53] <downmagic> oh god
[2:20:54] <%fetrigon> @captainpiledriver ABSORB
[2:20:55] <%Juriasu> negative delay!

[4:02:54] <UberWolfman> 80% confident F2P
[4:02:57] <+Ricky_Rexx> I doubt it
[4:02:58] <RyuuAoi> Rage quit on an arcade cabinet. BRIG BACK ARCADES.
[4:02:58] <JdotSweapA> mmmm
[4:02:59] <TigerClaws12> 1000%
[4:02:59] <w_khan> Make the game free and gain billions in skins
[4:03:01] <@Menitta> Free or not I'll try this
[4:03:02] <Asuterisuku> The Cannon brothers - the ones who founded EVO - know what's up.
[4:03:02] <%DashXero> Probably.
[4:03:02] <T_Sasquatch> Yes duh
[4:03:02] <%ekodrop> probably
[4:03:03] <+CalderGaming> @Menitta they made GGPO so yes
[4:03:04] <someyounguy1> i cant imagine it wouldnt be. everything else is free
[4:03:04] <Eger007> probably
[4:03:04] <+kewlmyc> All free
[4:03:08] <%Zero_Jacks> F R E E 9 9
[4:03:08] <mikesapartment> free free and free
[4:03:10] <%tank7013> They would be fools not to make it F2P
[4:03:10] <+polothegreatest> Animation looks doodOK
[4:03:12] <BalloniWright> do it like Brawhalla
[4:03:13] <MyNameIsRasus> Free to play on almost everything
[4:03:13] <Astrophizz> not the latest games
[4:03:14] <w_khan> The League RPG is paid
[4:03:15] <@Menitta> Is Valorant free
[4:03:15] <%AlteisenReiseZ> SALTY LEAGUE FANS IN TEARS BECAUSE THEY CAN'T BLAME THEIR TEAM WHEN THEY LOSE
[4:03:16] <someyounguy1> league and valorant are free
[4:03:16] <Qu1ckyyy> 30$ for Ruined king
[4:03:16] <+tactician0> ALL OF IT
[4:03:17] <+0neReeler> yes
[4:03:17] <+froduck42> The sunken king wasn't free to play
[4:03:17] <%mighty_max_t> Also, will it be PC exclusive or will it come to consoles too?
[4:03:17] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:03:19] <%cubbywolf> if its not f2p with payed DLC for every other character going forward then why have a billion dollars?
[4:03:19] <huskarl_zap> whens TEEMO
[4:03:19] <mikesapartment> the new games on steam cost dosh
[4:03:20] <artificiallynatural> all free, pay for skins n shit
[4:03:20] <TheSaltminer> everything they do is F2P
[4:03:21] <+TheScorpionEater> valorant was free
[4:03:22] <+kewlmyc> League and Valorant is free
[4:03:22] <0cash> their biggest games are f2p
[4:03:23] <+polothegreatest> SKINS
[4:03:23] <UberWolfman> FRee
[4:03:23] <Astrophizz> the rpg and rhythm games are paid
[4:03:25] <+froduck42> Ruined King Sorry
[4:03:25] <%Javaa01> @Menitta Yes
[4:03:25] <%SirGO0SE> all free
[4:03:26] <+Ricky_Rexx> Ruined King isn't free
[4:03:26] <MyNameIsRasus> Free
[4:03:26] <%townzzzzz> 5.99 for deez skinz
[4:03:28] <+0neReeler> dlc cosmetics
[4:03:29] <Asuterisuku> Recently released games are not free.
[4:03:31] <+0dinpen> Valorant and tft and card is free
[4:03:32] <+Ultimate_Edge> Ruined King on Steam you have to pay for
[4:03:32] <Astrophizz> single player is not free
[4:03:32] <T_Sasquatch> All their multiplayer games are free
[4:03:32] <UberWolfman> Ruined King is not free
[4:03:32] <@Menitta> Yeah ok it's all Free.99
[4:03:32] <+ghostfaceninja_> I believe Ruined King is the only non-free game
[4:03:33] <TigerClaws12> 3rd party games a paid but 1st party games are all free @WoolieVersus
[4:03:35] <dmysta3000> In the meantime, check out Arcane, it‚Äôs really good, even if you know nothing about LoL
[4:03:37] <%jinking79> costume will probably be were the money coming from
[4:03:37] <+polothegreatest> CSGO CLONE
[4:03:38] <w_khan> @WoolieVersus the only paid is the league RPG that launched now
[4:03:39] <Eger007> they made one single player rpg 30$
[4:03:43] <DedlokPM> @WoolieVersus The Ruined King is $20, Hextech Mayhem is $10. Everything else is free.
[4:03:45] <BackwardCap> The RPG is 30, yeah
[4:03:46] <0cash> Only the single player rpg and the new rythm game are paid
[4:03:47] <@Menitta> this is going to be good
[4:03:47] <theblackbreath> thada be so wild
[4:03:49] <Shardlab> "Remember, you step up 1v1, you only have yourself to blame. Let's Go."
[4:03:49] <+smikeye> the characters will probably pay-per
[4:03:49] <MyNameIsRasus> If this one doesn't work
[4:03:49] <%Qsmash_> If it's F2P, then its over. Most popular Fighting game. Free.
[4:03:50] <Haarute> the RPG and rhythm are paid.
[4:03:54] <%cubbywolf> but does it have Batman vs Shaggy?
[4:03:56] <+polothegreatest> RPG is not free
[4:03:59] <yukichocomilk> FGS ARE SAVED
[4:04:00] <Crowroost> Fiddlesticks is just a fable. A story to scare children.
[4:04:00] <@Menitta> this will be goooooooood
[4:04:08] <+TheScorpionEater> i miss motion imputs but im old man yelling at cloud
[4:04:09] <%SirGO0SE> it looks so good
[4:04:09] <Asuterisuku> I would not be playing fighting games today if it weren't for Rising Thunder.
[4:04:14] <Astrophizz> I wonder if they'll lock down tournaments and commentators
[4:04:17] <KaiserMario> Shame about the work ethics tho
[4:04:17] <+kewlmyc> YEah, it it's multiplayer, it's free, if it's single player, it cost money. That seems to be Riot's model
[4:04:18] <UberWolfman> Whens my Dunk Darius Costume
[4:04:19] <JdotSweapA> what is this in alpha rn?
[4:04:21] <T_Sasquatch> Lemme see those inputs
[4:04:23] <TheSaltminer> SFXT
[4:04:23] <%cubbywolf> this art is great too, like a pixel 3d
[4:04:26] <+Suneater_Jerome> imagine how optimised it's gonna be too on pc
[4:04:27] <%mr_sups> Tekken Tag?
[4:04:28] <Shardlab> Cross tag and Skullgirls
[4:04:29] <0cash> i'd rather have it be 1v1 bu 2v2 is fine
[4:04:30] <@Menitta> ooooh man this looks cool
[4:04:30] <%Cozy90> but can you get 4 players in a game?
[4:04:31] <+pectusumbra> the only thing they made that's paid is the single player RPG they just put out
[4:04:33] <Asuterisuku> BlazBlud: Cross Tag Battle
[4:04:35] <w_khan> Making it free and gaining $$$ with already existing skins is the best idea
[4:04:37] <Asuterisuku> SNK Heroines
[4:04:41] <%SirGO0SE> we got gatlings
[4:04:42] <%cubbywolf> looks like Arcsys style
[4:04:44] <+pectusumbra> I imagine this game will be free but by character DLC/Skins?
[4:04:45] <+Ricky_Rexx> I just wish we some love for the less popular league characters
[4:04:48] <+SnorlaxBud> Riot: buy them skins all over again ppl
[4:04:49] <Crowroost> High above the rotten rows. Cloth and metal. Teeth and crows.
[4:04:49] <+Ultimate_Edge> Wait Special 1? So potentially two special buttons?
[4:04:52] <T_Sasquatch> FREE
[4:04:54] <BackwardCap> They straight up tell you that this game is still in R&D, so this footage is gonna be rough.
[4:04:55] <@Menitta> so are these league characters
[4:05:00] <+Ricky_Rexx> @Menitta yes
[4:05:02] <Asuterisuku> @Ultimate_Edge RT was 3 special buttons.
[4:05:07] <@Menitta> ok cool awesome
[4:05:09] <+Ultimate_Edge> Ah
[4:05:12] <FrostedZaibatsu> Did Rising Thunder have overheads?
[4:05:12] <%AlteisenReiseZ> CAN'T WAIT FOR THAT MOBA SALT, YUP
[4:05:13] <Super_Voltekka> Dunkey's gonna make a video about this I'm sure. He'll probably trash it
[4:05:15] <w_khan> if the game is good then i have no problem buying the skins again
[4:05:22] <@Menitta> I want that Talon guy with his Strider costume
[4:05:24] <+polothegreatest> Diana or Leona doodNuts
[4:05:24] <Asuterisuku> @FrostedZaibatsu Dedicated overheads on 6M
[4:05:26] <+Ricky_Rexx> The combined salt of the MOBA and FGC communities is too much
[4:05:28] <%jinking79> all the Mobile LoL fans calling Overheads  Headshots LUL
[4:05:33] <+fizzguy47> is this just with Arcane characters, not all of League?
[4:05:34] <%tank7013> Hopefully they're smart enough to not put a dp on down button
[4:05:35] <BlackermanZX> i really want nasus and neeko on this game
[4:05:40] <%SirGO0SE> omg the moba community is going to learn what its like to not be able to blame your team LUL LUL LUL
[4:05:42] <someyounguy1> they might add that later
[4:05:43] <MyNameIsRasus> They might add that later
[4:05:44] <@Menitta> god this looks GOOD
[4:05:47] <w_khan> @Menitta i want Yasuo with his Jetstream Sam costume
[4:05:52] <DedlokPM> @WoolieVersus They released 2 Riot Forge games. They are pay noot F2P. The Ruined King is $30, Hextech Mayhem is $10. Everything LoL, Runeterra, Valorant, and Wild Blitz are all free, though.
[4:05:52] <Asuterisuku> Low high mixups based on what characters were in play.
[4:05:54] <FrostedZaibatsu> @Asuterisuku ok
[4:05:57] <%mighty_max_t> They could also get LoL players in if there's a perk for playing this, like a currency or costume unlock or something
[4:05:59] <@Menitta> WAIT HIS WHAT
[4:05:59] <Shardlab> You're on your own.....
[4:06:07] <Asuterisuku> Vlad was a big high-low mixup guy.
[4:06:07] <Astrophizz> @SirGO0SE I saw someone on twitter who thought 2v2 meant they played with another human on their team lol
[4:06:07] <+pectusumbra> show me some shadow isles champs
[4:06:08] <+polothegreatest> Blame WIFI LUL
[4:06:09] <TheSaltminer> @fizzguy47 well Darius, Ahri and Katarina are in, so no
[4:06:10] <+TheScorpionEater> negative edge maybe?
[4:06:11] <MyNameIsRasus> I think certain moves create it
[4:06:13] <BackwardCap> I'm surprised Ekko got shown before Yasuo.
[4:06:14] <artificiallynatural> looks like it's on his specials
[4:06:19] <%ChoculaUltra> Hoping to the league gods my boy Master Yi ends up on the roster one way or the other
[4:06:22] <TigerClaws12> he said if certain moves connect
[4:06:25] <w_khan> @Menitta look for project yasuo
[4:06:28] <%SirGO0SE> @SirGO0SE theyre already looking for outs Kappa
[4:06:31] <%cubbywolf> that looks so cool
[4:06:34] <w_khan> and its animations
[4:06:42] <%Calenrow> Calenrow subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months! 
[4:06:46] <Shardlab> And there's no way to vote away Champions you suck against or are aggravated with
[4:06:54] <%cubbywolf> i think you have to go back
[4:06:57] <+Radiantomega> GOD Yone and Yasou will probably be just as cancer here as in league
[4:06:58] <Super_Voltekka> Where's the two-headed cyclops guy?
[4:07:00] <Shardlab> You have to learn the matchup
[4:07:01] <%cubbywolf> if you dont that would be great
[4:07:07] <KaiserMario> To me, those look like day zero nerfs, char probably gonna get reworked a lot
[4:07:14] <%RaziWraith> Now we just need a CoD crossover fighting game and we will have the salty triumvirate of video game communities. LUL
[4:07:15] <%Qsmash_> that seems way more natural than traits or v-skills or something
[4:07:17] <w_khan> Yo true Yone is going to be fun
[4:07:22] <FrostedZaibatsu> @SirGO0SE Yes sir!!!
[4:07:26] <%cubbywolf> oh he can so its a choice
[4:07:30] <%Calenrow> this looks wild wow
[4:07:34] <TurkinaKeshik> Return also seems to be cancelling any move.
[4:07:35] <taeko_ohnuki> such nasty mix
[4:07:36] <+CalderGaming> it's just that move and the air version of that move
[4:07:39] <TigerClaws12> that's so dirty
[4:07:39] <glumbaron> it says you can choose to rewind for the next few seconds...neat
[4:07:42] <+0dinpen> imagine if you put an assist there
[4:07:44] <Astrophizz> press button to mix
[4:07:47] <%mighty_max_t> Maybe it's a L-M-H situation
[4:07:47] <BlackermanZX> i bet they will add Vi on the launch roster because Arcane
[4:07:49] <%SirGO0SE> i wonder if he can use that like a PRC and make a bunch of shit safe
[4:07:50] <%ChoculaUltra> I wanna see ranged champs too. Ezreal is definitely getting in.
[4:07:52] <glumbaron> in practice it feels a lot like watching millia airdash around
[4:07:52] <Shardlab> It's hit gimmick button like in Blazblue. Nice
[4:08:01] <SpookyMooks> this looks real nice
[4:08:03] <%mighty_max_t> Light is roll, Medium is Dash, Heavy is Jump
[4:08:03] <Shardlab> *his
[4:08:11] <+polothegreatest> No monsters tho, china dont like
[4:08:11] <Crowroost> Through the field. Down the lane. Voices never heard again.
[4:08:15] <+fizzguy47> just give him a h disc on knockdown, why dont you
[4:08:16] <JdotSweapA> reminds me of shiba in BftG
[4:08:24] <+pectusumbra> @BlackermanZX I mean she's also a classic brawler punchgirl. She's just a natural fit for a fighter. Even has a command grab ult
[4:08:36] <huskarl_zap> TOP IS FED
[4:08:39] <+Ultimate_Edge> For early R&D, the background already looks pretty good
[4:08:45] <Asuterisuku> I was an Edge player, though Dauntless was also a favourite.
[4:08:46] <w_khan> Sett is a good pick too
[4:08:53] <glumbaron> yeah Vi seems like an obvious char to have in the game
[4:08:59] <0cash> its close to granblue
[4:08:59] <Asuterisuku> Tilts were a thing in Rising Thunder.
[4:09:00] <TigerClaws12> power rangers
[4:09:01] <Shardlab> So we're goin' Granblue on this
[4:09:03] <MyNameIsRasus> Vi and Sett NEED to be in this
[4:09:03] <huskarl_zap> OOKIZEMAY IS FED
[4:09:05] <%ChoculaUltra> Garen is definitely going to get in. He's one of the poster boys.
[4:09:07] <Crowroost> It's hunting us. It knows what we're afraid of.
[4:09:11] <+polothegreatest> Ryze or other mage?
[4:09:15] <taeko_ohnuki> Vi is too obvious and I'm happy for it
[4:09:24] <%ChoculaUltra> Veigar would be great as the small character. Or Teemo.
[4:09:29] <0cash> lux will be in
[4:09:33] <BackwardCap> Get Asol in this gildedSmug
[4:09:33] <MyNameIsRasus> Poppy could be in
[4:09:35] <w_khan> Yodles will probably be multiple characters in one
[4:09:39] <%mighty_max_t> Lee Sin also seems made for this
[4:09:43] <+froduck42> Yorick as a zoner
[4:09:43] <@Menitta> oh man I'm hype
[4:09:47] <MyNameIsRasus> Lee Sin also obvious
[4:09:50] <theblackbreath> Imagine the positioning with Thresh
[4:09:52] <%ChoculaUltra> oh man, Ziggs and Heimer as z duo zoner/trap character tho?
[4:09:53] <Asuterisuku> Rising thunder DID have tilts, dedicated command normals as well as altering properties for certain specials like Chel's fireballs
[4:09:54] <Crowroost> They haven't come back from the fields. It's been three days.
[4:09:56] <%cubbywolf> the old heads are gunna hate it
[4:10:03] <+pectusumbra> Zoner Morgana Let's Goooooo
[4:10:04] <MyNameIsRasus> Oh Thresh is gonna be disgusting
[4:10:05] <+fizzguy47> who will be the shoto
[4:10:15] <+polothegreatest> Braum doodCrazy
[4:10:18] <+pectusumbra> Lee Sin
[4:10:18] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1460530098050945027?s=20
[4:10:19] <MyNameIsRasus> BRAUM LESS GO
[4:10:23] <MyNameIsRasus> BRAUM EVERYWHERE SYSTEM
[4:10:40] <BlackermanZX> Oh god Teemo LUL
[4:10:43] <%jinking79> granblue versus too
[4:10:47] <theblackbreath> @MyNameIsRasus im sayin
[4:10:55] <artificiallynatural> I hope braum or kindred make it in
[4:10:55] <+0neReeler> gbfv inputs are the best
[4:10:58] <%SirGO0SE> @jinking79 god i loved that game
[4:10:59] <%ChoculaUltra> Udyr as a 4 stance character tho
[4:11:05] <T_Sasquatch> In betting you'll get one character per archetype then the rest you "earn" or pay for
[4:11:07] <TigerClaws12> video is 30fps
[4:11:22] <yukichocomilk> there's no way the game will run at 30
[4:11:24] <%Qsmash_> its definitely slowed down
[4:11:24] <@Menitta> I bet it;ll be 60 at launch
[4:11:31] <Asuterisuku> I really hope it doesn't run like this.
[4:11:40] <RyuuAoi> FTP?
[4:11:43] <T_Sasquatch> The screen effects are a bit much tbh
[4:11:50] <+Ultimate_Edge> Hell no. This probably is just saying this is what the game feel and art will be like. That dude would not release at 30.
[4:11:50] <%Josef_Stryker> Axe Guy is likely gonna be my main until I see a grappler like Potemkin
[4:12:07] <%townzzzzz> won't save you from the brazil player
[4:12:08] <+redyoshi5> @WoolieVersus they said this is a vertical slice it wont be out till 2023
[4:12:13] <Asuterisuku> Get fucked Wi-fi users
[4:12:23] <%ChoculaUltra> damn they said FUCK wifi players LUL
[4:12:24] <+polothegreatest> To the gulac
[4:12:25] <0cash> make them that 5% weaker
[4:12:29] <glumbaron> yeah i don't think i'd worry about framerate yet
[4:12:32] <RyuuAoi> Hmmmmm
[4:12:34] <+CalderGaming> i trust the cannon's TEAM
[4:12:36] <Daxalog> Dota does Rage Quit Jail. League just stops you from playing for a bit
[4:12:37] <Eger007> no?
[4:12:38] <+froduck42> Not really
[4:12:38] <critfumble_> lets dial that back a bit
[4:12:39] <+CalderGaming> i don't trust riot
[4:12:40] <critfumble_> hmm
[4:12:43] <mikesapartment> WHAT
[4:12:44] <Asuterisuku> I don't trust Riot, Riot is Blizzard LITE
[4:12:46] <wqorst> lol...
[4:12:46] <0cash> i trust Radiant, not riot
[4:12:46] <%townzzzzz> trusting riot Kappa
[4:12:46] <%RyTYoung> LUL LUL LUL
[4:12:46] <+kewlmyc> I trust the devs, not Riot in jeneral
[4:12:50] <+kewlmyc> *general
[4:12:52] <FrostedZaibatsu> I dont trust Riot. I trust the brothers
[4:12:53] <%Qsmash_> "I trust Riot" I wouldn't say that but I get what you mean
[4:12:53] <@Menitta> holy shit
[4:12:56] <MyNameIsRasus> Riot devs
[4:12:57] <glumbaron> riot has, a lot of good devs in it,
[4:12:59] <+pectusumbra> Careful with that Reggie. Don't want another Ireland situation
[4:12:59] <glumbaron> and also,
[4:13:01] <BlackermanZX> dont trust riot at all LUL
[4:13:02] <+TheScorpionEater> lmao i dont trust riot at fuckin all LUL
[4:13:09] <BlackermanZX> just trust the devs
[4:13:12] <TigerClaws12> the back down
[4:13:13] <%RyTYoung> I have never played a Riot Games
[4:13:16] <%linSP> I believe in riot DEVS
[4:13:17] <%Calenrow> the individuals in charge of making the games at riot are pretty good.
[4:13:17] <MyNameIsRasus> It super does
[4:13:22] <%SirGO0SE> just say the games in good hands LUL
[4:13:22] <%jinking79> Reggie aka Bobby LUL
[4:13:23] <cartakus> v
[4:13:23] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> I trust the team making this game lol
[4:13:25] <+TheScorpionEater> china shell company stealing data LUL
[4:13:34] <Louie_Salmon> I trust riot money
[4:13:44] <KaiserMario> That's right Reggie Kotick
[4:13:48] <taeko_ohnuki> I trust the Cannons
[4:13:50] <Asuterisuku> It'll almost certainly be 60.
[4:13:56] <MyNameIsRasus> This is very early
[4:13:57] <0cash> lets hope
[4:13:58] <critfumble_> they have more money than god to throw at it so itll be shiny
[4:14:01] <%Cozy90> I just want it to have 2 player teams. i want my friends to play with me.
[4:14:04] <+smikeye> it's at least 18 months out, stop worrying about it
[4:14:05] <+0dinpen> thats a valid concern
[4:14:06] <Haarute> there's no chance it runs at less than 60, this is a PC gaming company. what i think is that they might go for a guilty gear animation style.
[4:14:11] <glumbaron> there'll be other videos before it comes out to monitor the framerate on lol
[4:14:13] <RyuuAoi> Does Riot have money?
[4:14:13] <yukichocomilk> there's no way they do rollback 2 and then release a 30fps fighting game LUL
[4:14:28] <+boosh5> @RyuuAoi Riot has all the money
[4:14:32] <critfumble_> @RyuuAoi does the pope shit in the woods?
[4:14:34] <taeko_ohnuki> no shot there'll be performance issues
[4:14:37] <FrostedZaibatsu> @RyuuAoi LUL what????
[4:14:37] <Asuterisuku> @Haarute Where characters are animated at 15fps but the physics and world around them happen at 60?
[4:14:42] <RyuuAoi> @critfumble_ Probably
[4:14:54] <Abd0022> they changed the art style from the earlier trailers it's probably super early footage

[4:17:30] <Asuterisuku> Rising Thunder would not run on phones.

[4:18:22] <+TheScorpionEater> looks better than KOF15 LUL
[4:18:31] <DedlokPM> I dunno about Hextech Mayhem, but I know Ruined King is multiplatform. Also they charged money for the both of them. Everything else has been free

[4:21:17] <%jinking79> no jinx list is trash LUL
[4:21:20] <%tank7013> And Ryu will probably be there
[4:21:21] <bobxmaker> fiora would be cool, fencers in fighting games is like staple character
[4:21:24] <%Calenrow> Sett probably wasn't out when woolie was looking
[4:21:24] <BlackermanZX> it will be a balancing nightmare too LUL
[4:21:24] <0cash> Sett for sure thankfully
[4:21:26] <+Ricky_Rexx> Garen is a shoto
[4:21:28] <+TheScorpionEater> imagine the patch notes LMAO

[4:21:34] <%Qsmash_> I said the same thing about Granblue and looked how that turned out.
[4:21:35] <%baka_sugoi> John Halo as guest fighter
[4:21:39] <+polothegreatest> Happy ryu
[4:21:41] <%DashXero> Think of the potential for GUEST characters.
[4:21:41] <+pectusumbra> Fiddlesticks still isn't in runeterra is he?
[4:21:42] <+kewlmyc> Yeah, balancing sounds like a nightmare. Also matchup knowledge
[4:21:46] <Shardlab> Them patches are gonna come fast and furious
[4:21:50] <RyuuAoi> This could be the new smash
[4:21:51] <yukichocomilk> LUL yup

[4:22:01] <+kewlmyc> OH look, SonicFox won again
[4:22:03] <Shardlab> Some new monster will come up
[4:22:03] <BackwardCap> I was Azir in so he can have the win quote "TELL THE PEOPLE What you have SEEN TODAY!"
[4:22:05] <someyounguy1> the sonic fox everywhere system grows in power
[4:22:06] <%mighty_max_t> Sivir and Taliyah also look cool
[4:22:08] <%baka_sugoi> its the same faces in top 10
[4:22:09] <RyuuAoi> They can get Mario. They can.
[4:22:10] <BalloniWright> Daigo LUL
[4:22:12] <MyNameIsRasus> Sonic Fox Warwick main

[4:22:14] <Asuterisuku> Sonic got their butt beat at Kumite though.
[4:22:15] <artificiallynatural> Man I hope Project L comes out with it's own blitz matchup spreadsheet
[4:22:18] <+polothegreatest> Nno support champs doodSad
[4:22:22] <+0neReeler> sonic is kind of newschool

[4:22:26] <%jinking79> easy money bets
[4:22:28] <Crowroost> Fiddlesticks. End of men. Fiddlesticks. First of ten.

[4:22:37] <FrostedZaibatsu> SonicFox just got eliminated at the Red Bull tournament. They dont practic they arent good
[4:22:38] <Astrophizz> I wonder if Riot will have their own exclusive tourneys and commentators
[4:22:38] <%Qsmash_> 1m prize for winning EVO in League of Fighters
[4:22:44] <@Menitta> I remember a bunch of Pokemon card game players got pretty far in some Pokken tournaments
[4:22:47] <MyNameIsRasus> @TheSaltminer that's the team then
[4:22:48] <Shardlab> Maybe you'll be up in there
[4:22:57] <artificiallynatural> If fighting games got a blitz or opgg equivalent, it'd make learning matchups so much easier
[4:22:59] <RyuuAoi> Just like they play FF14
[4:23:03] <+pectusumbra> @Astrophizz they will but they won't pay well
[4:23:08] <someyounguy1> with the reach of this game we will probably see new big powers coming from previously unseen countries
[4:23:12] <zerointelligence000> faker vs sonic
[4:23:13] <%linSP> What if the new sonic fox was a league player
[4:23:21] <huskarl_zap> oakyzemay is fed

[4:23:28] <OldManDeckardCain> you have like at least 2 years to train buddy LUL
[4:23:30] <Shardlab> Cross Tag Battle
[4:23:33] <RyuuAoi> Woolie will never play ff 14
[4:23:38] <Super_Voltekka> Tyler1 would go apeshit if he played it
[4:23:42] <Astrophizz> @Astrophizz yeah - aren't LoL and Valorant commentators disallowed from covering other games?
[4:23:52] <critfumble_> Kappa
[4:24:02] <%jinking79> fightcade those mahvel games
[4:24:07] <+kewlmyc> Cross Tag Battle is pretty damn free as well
[4:24:11] <BlackermanZX> MVCI SklUlgirls and cross tag
[4:24:18] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> @TigerClaws12 has got it. It looks closer to power rangers than anything
[4:24:19] <%tank7013> MVCI the best worst game
[4:24:19] <+0neReeler> infinite is kind of ridiculous
[4:24:19] <%mighty_max_t> Power Rangers does too
[4:24:22] <TigerClaws12> bbtag is fucked up LUL
[4:24:22] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:24:25] <SpikedFreak> you can catch bbtag sooooo cheap very often
[4:24:27] <%Calenrow> Riot has some contracts with certain commentators, but others work as freelancers. I bet they'll have some in-house people and some freelancers
[4:24:44] <@Menitta> What about TVC
[4:24:59] <+Ultimate_Edge> Yeah let's send that poor dude into the Touch of death game LUL
[4:25:01] <+kewlmyc> @Menitta Good luck finding that game without pirating it
[4:25:15] <+0neReeler> it's like marvel series crossover combination
[4:25:24] <+CalderGaming> Battle for the Grid, yes
[4:25:29] <+0neReeler> mvci is used to keep assist pressure
[4:25:33] <%mighty_max_t> Given the simple controls, Power Rangers also would be a good fit
[4:25:49] <Astrophizz> @Calenrow That's good to know. Do LoL and Valorant have non-Riot tourneys?
[4:25:53] <BlackermanZX> oh true Battle for the Grid
[4:26:03] <@Menitta> I liked MVCI more than UMVC3. I will not elaborate.
[4:26:08] <Afrobrawler> poor jedah
[4:26:15] <%mighty_max_t> I loved my Spidey/Strider team and Cap's new moves were cool
[4:26:18] <+kewlmyc> MvCI will always be a tragedy
[4:26:20] <TheSaltminer> they're just FUNCTIONS though Reggie
[4:26:21] <+0neReeler> parsec umvc3 with mods woo
[4:26:23] <BackwardCap> Ultron was cool gildedDerp
[4:26:26] <+Atomic_ColliderSG> Sigma was a great pull
[4:26:28] <SpikedFreak> cap marvel was fun
[4:26:33] <%tank7013> Sigma's voice actor was fantastic
[4:26:33] <@Menitta> Gamora was incredibly fun
[4:26:34] <%jinking79> we could've had Dante & Vergil JACKPOT tag super
[4:26:39] <RyuuAoi> Uber eats delivers booze
[4:26:45] <%tank7013> Venom animated really well
[4:26:48] <Asuterisuku> Which is a shame, because the online was good.
[4:26:50] <0cash> that'd be a fun mode
[4:26:56] <critfumble_> hmmmmmmm

[4:27:13] <%mighty_max_t> God, I remember that
[4:27:17] <0cash> fighterz has that too and it was cool
[4:27:18] <@Menitta> I want dumb stupid modes like that
[4:27:23] <BalloniWright> I loved SFxT LUL
[4:27:23] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> X TK 4 players was dumb fun

[4:27:25] <BackwardCap> No V Joe, no Ammy. No wonder MvCi died. sajamStare
[4:27:26] <critfumble_> "teamfight mode" or something
[4:27:28] <BlackermanZX> Mugen 2v2 would be nuts
[4:27:29] <konarius> all games are silly
[4:27:32] <+0neReeler> don't tag me in DONT tag me in
[4:27:34] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> I loved that mode
[4:27:37] <zerointelligence000> that sounds weird as hell but on brand for lol
[4:27:38] <RyuuAoi> Tbf x tekken taught me combos
[4:27:50] <0cash> Fighterz
[4:27:53] <KaiserMario> SF EX3
[4:27:53] <BlackermanZX> MK9 iirc
[4:27:54] <+ghostfaceninja_> dramatic battle tho
[4:27:58] <%Cozy90> yea mk9 did
[4:28:08] <+0neReeler> smash brothers makes more sense
[4:28:09] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> Honestly I love X tekken but I hate all the stuff around it lol.
[4:28:31] <Abd0022> check yone out he's just edgier Yasuo
[4:28:38] <RyuuAoi> X Tekken is fine but it's definitely not too.
[4:28:40] <+0neReeler> make that quarter last
[4:29:03] <%mighty_max_t> SFxT definitely has issue but I really liked how they tranisitioned 80% of the Tekken characters to 2D
[4:29:14] <+ghostfaceninja_> "carried" certainly fits League LUL
[4:29:15] <Abd0022> no, that's dota i think
