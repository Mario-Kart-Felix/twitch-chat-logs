[0:10:24] <+Bluemanzee> It's so hype
[0:10:26] <%joe_bagadou_nautz> Is HK the Misato of this playthrough?
[0:10:34] <am_omega> "Durr durr Rei, durr durr Asuka" Nah fuck that Misato.
[0:10:37] <orphancrippler_> Hk best waifu
[0:10:40] <blazedauron> so does woolie still have a pazzak problem
[0:10:45] <talkingrain3139> How were the guns LittleV?
[0:10:50] <Psyramics> Lightsaber morningstar makes no sense
[0:10:50] <TigerClaws12> link the gifs
[0:10:53] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> You're a great commentator Lil V! Id love more LP's from you ^^
[0:10:54] <POUND_CAKE94> Yeah this has been great
[0:10:54] <+Donkula23> Lightsaber whip exists too
[0:10:54] <%OldManJEWc> there's a light whip
[0:10:59] <Redblood801> Statement: I would not be caught dead in the embrace of a meatbag
[0:11:00] <BigManLugan> V you're doing a fantastic cohost job and this is one of your best LPs Woolie
[0:11:03] <%Garthunox> theres a lightsabre slingshot woolie
[0:11:04] <aretos1> the whip makes SOME sense thou
[0:11:05] <olaksi> No don't get scientific, it's star wars
[0:11:09] <%OldManJEWc> @don2323 ayyy
[0:11:16] <+chiazam> No stop
[0:11:17] <MasterKoosh> Arrogant Boast: Oh masters, of course I'm the best girl
[0:11:18] <jorniev> travis touchdown has a giant club
[0:11:23] <grouchio> if there's a whip there's a waaaay
[0:11:28] <@SoushinSen> When there's a force, there is a way. Anything is possible.
[0:11:28] <maplemillk> What's better? The Star or the War?
[0:11:29] <RayCSmooth> Just use the force
[0:11:34] <aretos1> Lightsaber gun
[0:11:35] <drefizz> why would use have a light morningstar, if that hits you when you swing it, you're done
[0:11:35] <%Scarnehu> magic space sword powered by crystals
[0:11:38] <orphancrippler_> I want a lightsaber shield
[0:11:48] <%sshen> @aretos1 lightsaber gun happened in rebels
[0:11:48] <+Donkula23> you'd be surprised how many dumb light weapons are around
[0:11:56] <%Scarnehu> light Halberd
[0:11:57] <+MidnightBurst12> also those weapons rely on their mass to do damage
[0:12:00] <Mechazoic_Era> what about like the marauder's axe?
[0:12:00] <aretos1> jesus chirst
[0:12:05] <+Ashaea> Energy Sword best sword
[0:12:05] <anar_bael> yo what have I missed?
[0:12:06] <Redblood801> Cortosis though
[0:12:07] <custoadian> my favorite dumb EU lightsaber thing is the cyborg with lightsabers in his knees and elbows.
[0:12:10] <ralphfromdk> Unless you make it out of that lightsaber proof metal
[0:12:11] <+chiazam> Energy shields work on lightsabers apparently
[0:12:15] <Maleicus> i thought it wasnt gonna happen this week but im glad i checked
[0:12:16] <+Donkula23> javelin
[0:12:24] <Superdandy96> The science of Star Wars is maklunky
[0:12:32] <+libra_zero> There’s a lightsaber GUN somewhere in the old lore
[0:12:43] <orphancrippler_> lightsaber crowbar
[0:12:50] <drefizz> what about hard light constructs Woolie
[0:12:53] <@Commando_Joe> don't gungans have energy shields?
[0:12:53] <+chiazam> Wtf does that even mean lightsaber gun
[0:12:55] <+galagoth> Glaive is the coolest weapon
[0:12:58] <+wunp_fxs> i prefer that axe but ok
[0:12:59] <grouchio> Odachi best Nioh weapon
[0:13:00] <olaksi> spears for lyfe!
[0:13:00] <%Scarnehu> it's a bunch of musha-shaka-paka
[0:13:01] <thesickestzak> LIGHTSABER NUNCHUCKS
[0:13:07] <%BallerSwagBro9k> GUNSWORDTRICKROYAL
[0:13:09] <mr_sups> I wish Rey got a lightsaber spear type thing
[0:13:10] <trinityxlv> theres a light whip
[0:13:17] <%OldManJEWc> The almost naginata looking saber from SWTOR is pretty rad tho
[0:13:25] <grouchio> eazy breezy
[0:13:26] <%ECRead> bare fists in best Nioh weapon
[0:13:29] <@Commando_Joe> https://lumiere-a.akamaihd.net/v1/images/databank_gunganpersonalenergyshield_01_169_78606583.jpeg?region=0%2C49%2C1560%2C780 Gungans totally have energy shields
[0:13:32] <+wunp_fxs> YES WATCH IT
[0:13:39] <+Donkula23> if you make the shaft of the light spear out of phrik or beskar you'd have a pretty effective weapon against other lightsabers....
[0:13:41] <StarlitStunner> Easy Breezy
[0:13:44] <Superdandy96> Laser sword is the simplest. But what about Laser Lances?!?
[0:13:55] <%Quiet__Viking> eizouken is the best
[0:14:00] <%Scarnehu> it's almost as good as beastars
[0:14:00] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Crybaby made me cry like a baby 10/10
[0:14:03] <+chiazam> I’m not in love with Easy Breezy
[0:14:04] <ralphfromdk> Best lightsaber design is from the The old Republic trailer with the mom and her extendo handle, where her standard saber could turn into a pike, boom, 1 meter extra reach like that
[0:14:09] <Jaku2011> Fuck all that Dorohedoro is the best thing this season
[0:14:09] <am_omega> Devilman Crybaby was as usual for Devilman. Looked cool though.
[0:14:14] <jorniev> lightsaber greatsword?
[0:14:19] <arsonistdaria> easy breezy
[0:14:23] <ZeeJiggle> That EXISTS
[0:14:24] <Sapphire_Breeze> yes
[0:14:24] <trickquestionz> That was Legenfs
[0:14:26] <Redblood801> That's a thing
[0:14:26] <grouchio> Dorohedoro watch it
[0:14:27] <%BallerSwagBro9k> PUNCH JEDI
[0:14:28] <Chatterbox1991> @woolieversus what about a light saber whip
[0:14:28] <+o_almighty_1> I’ve always wanted to see a dual wielding short blade user. Specializing in close combat
[0:14:31] <%Scarnehu> yeah
[0:14:32] <Squeethemog> Mad Max light saber armor would look so cool!
[0:14:33] <sendart> warhammer power weapons
[0:14:33] <+MidnightBurst12> that is a thing
[0:14:34] <mr_sups> Thats actually a thing
[0:14:34] <%TheOneCalledRock> doesn't a lightsaber dagger exist?
[0:14:36] <Zebroneath> That's super dumb, and I love it
[0:14:36] <am_omega> When Devilman Lady?
[0:14:38] <randominternetsurfer> Hey Little V, when are you gonna cover MGR "The Only Thing I Know"
[0:14:42] <%TheOneCalledRock> make a variant of that
[0:14:43] <Matermind0> Lightsaber knees
[0:14:44] <ZeeJiggle> Someone link the thing.
[0:14:45] <SaturnianOcean> I think that's a thing already, and it looks really dumb
[0:14:45] <grouchio> So does Dorohedoro
[0:14:46] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Penance Armor with Lightsabers LUL
[0:14:49] <orphancrippler_> lightsaber wolverine claws
[0:14:49] <ZeeJiggle> cuz i dunno what its called
[0:14:50] <%Scarnehu> woolieFUN woolieFUN woolieFUN
[0:14:52] <+o_almighty_1> Think John wick but with short sabers
[0:14:54] <%OldManJEWc> Well, wouldn't it just be like the vibroblades but for gauntlets?
[0:15:04] <SaturnianOcean> Or was a thing in legends, I should say
[0:15:10] <TigerClaws12> monkaS
[0:15:11] <%Takreth> monkaS
[0:15:12] <olaksi> i think all light-weapons would almost certainly end up maiming their users
[0:15:12] <1matheuw> YEYEYEY
[0:15:13] <+steelmorrigan> Guyver blades?
[0:15:20] <arsonistdaria> thanks lil v

[0:15:30] <grouchio> unlimited paaaatience
[0:15:33] <Squeethemog> Infinte? Are we about to get super edgy XD
[0:15:35] <resloxxx> Preach
[0:15:35] <+MidnightBurst12> truly paragons of patience
[0:15:35] <trickquestionz> That exists in Legends, the Emperor grew a mentally defective clone in a lab and stuck him in a lightsaber suit.
[0:15:36] <+Donkula23> we need more discussion of phrik and beskar armor lol
[0:15:38] <dereks0n> That’s what someone with Corona would say
[0:15:38] <anar_bael> content later

[0:49:56] <trickquestionz> Nar Shaddaa is the space libertarians paradise. I actually like what SWTOR did with it, by playing it ups as a totally unrestricted tech industry corporate hell.

[0:59:03] <Gruhunchously> There's probably someone in the EU who could pull off that shit.
[0:59:04] <derap41> That's kinda dumb
[0:59:05] <gruulmagebeast> manipulating the life force of an entire planet is PURE PAZAAK

[1:08:39] <asurite_warrior> Woolie is gonna choose Pazaak over the sisters
[1:08:43] <am_omega> I dunno is Kreia going to tell us to keep the PAKage in check?
[1:08:51] <NaturalGear> she's too preachy imho
[1:09:03] <SaturnianOcean> It is such a quiet thing to fall
[1:09:15] <Jaku2011> Ok Granny
[1:09:19] <+TheFabledAble> @WoolieVersus we know that canonically you gain lightside points for defense, sacrifice, and passiveness, and darkside for strong emotions, passionsand evil debocherous acts. Kreia despises acting hard light or hard dark without an understanding of nuance, because for her acting without critical thought makes you a slave
[1:09:22] <randominternetsurfer> @naturalgear she's your mentor. she needs to tell you shit cause you're both connected.
[1:09:22] <Deadbulky> Granny

[1:09:48] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LEAVE IT LUL
[1:09:48] <Gruhunchously> I love Kreia because, her philosophy makes sense, maybe not in a universal sense, but to her and who she has been and what's happened to her.
[1:09:58] <shincadad> Po g
[1:10:17] <%LiquidDinosaur> Kreia is rad because she isnt Evil she's just evil.
[1:10:19] <+zestyArsenic> looks fine

[1:10:29] <astrofalcon1> Punch girl PogChamp
[1:10:32] <%xcompleasedad> REAL good
[1:10:37] <Gruhunchously> Every belief that she has, you can trace back to some event in her life and kind of understand how she got that way.
[1:10:41] <+ThaSparren> Yea there is a logic to Kreias ideas its just up to whether you agree or disagree with it
[1:10:50] <Superdandy96> Oh Jesus handmaiden, we’re in public

[1:10:59] <randominternetsurfer> fucking level her up. it's boring if you stay with the same 2 partners.

[1:11:29] <%LiquidDinosaur> (also that spoiler Woolie saw that V says was disconfirmed wasnt disconfirmed. It' was "confirmed to be unintentional but Avellone is like "hmmm sure if you want to believe that then ok" ")
[1:11:43] <%OldManJEWc> Beo-Dor and the punch boys is a great band name
[1:11:46] <%LiquidDinosaur> (and it makes too much sense)
[1:12:00] <Heyestus> It makes you harder to resist, not better at saving.
[1:12:04] <Gruhunchously> @LiquidDinosaur It's a good theory with a lot of evidence to back it up, but I could go either way.
[1:12:12] <time_axis> putting things in brackets doesn't make woolie not see it
