[0:02:43] <+zooeymainbtw> we are one guy for we are many
[0:02:45] <petwisk> is Trading a Badge Level for a HP Level

[0:03:07] <DragonSpooker> ONE GIRL

[0:03:20] <%andrex2311> we good woolz
[0:03:23] <letshavecakes> The AM talk radio volume is fine, but maybe not what's needed for paper view wrestlemania

[0:03:26] <%Hawk_Rush> paper mario PogChamp
[0:03:29] <%jessyg920> ONE HUMAN

[0:03:38] <KaitlynnHere> That’s my fantasy
[0:03:53] <+magiclottie> so have they made it to chapter 4 yet?
[0:03:56] <%FenixSeraph> Chris Avellone?
[0:03:57] <%dmcRedgrave> What can change the nature of a man?
[0:03:59] <%Exiliator> game / novel LUL
[0:04:04] <%Exiliator> so much text
[0:04:05] <+magiclottie> cause i am so excited for woolie to see how broken Vivian is
[0:04:06] <Drusain> What is the nature of a man
[0:04:08] <%generalve> chris he may be a sexual predator :(
[0:04:10] <KOD_LAMASI> @dmcRedgrave what is a man?
[0:04:13] <petwisk> Apahaty is Death
[0:04:14] <Prevot> ssshhhh
[0:04:16] <%jessyg920> I am not caught up to the anime, I feel like I'm going to be so lost today.
[0:04:26] <%WG101> @oyunllama a miserable little pile of secrets
[0:04:33] <GenericSoda> @magiclottie no spoils man
[0:04:40] <%dmcRedgrave> It's really unfortunate to hear about Avellone.
[0:04:48] <%dmcRedgrave> But that's a depressing thought for another day.
[0:04:51] <Prevot> jesus, 16?!
[0:04:54] <jorniev> MONST OF THEM ARE LIES
[0:04:57] <GenericSoda> keep the future on the dl
[0:04:59] <DatAsuna> And no matter how much more you tell him it will remain the only thing lol
[0:05:04] <%ringabal> Reminds me of Baldur's Gate 2
[0:05:15] <milhousego> so how far do ya'll think we'll get today?
[0:05:16] <%Hawk_Rush> LUL
[0:05:16] <%andrex2311> LUL
[0:05:20] <+Euphbugg> LUL
[0:05:20] <%Hawk_Rush> get ready to get fired
[0:05:20] <%Daniel_Is_I> LUL
[0:05:20] <%cobalt_phoenix_> LUL
[0:05:24] <Railgun5> Is it super quiet or is it just me?
[0:05:27] <+zooeymainbtw> LUL
[0:05:38] <Papa_Bearman> I heard that VPNs aren't nearly as secure as people think.
[0:05:38] <+Massimoman64> nice hoodie Woolie
[0:05:39] <jorniev> who is screamng WOOOOOO
[0:05:52] <twieetcha> @woolieversus so woolie how many more horrors do you think we’ll see in this game?
[0:05:53] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:05:54] <%Hawk_Rush> i hope whoever you are you don't get in trouble 🤞
[0:05:57] <%Daniel_Is_I> If it's just rerouting then they WILL find out
[0:05:57] <%emperordread> As an IT nerd, it's shameful they even allow you to install your own software - so they probably won't notice the traffic either
[0:06:00] <%Exiliator> lord bless steam sales
[0:06:01] <@Commando_Joe> Woolie claims them on his taxes guys
[0:06:03] <@Commando_Joe> Don't ask him
[0:06:07] <@Commando_Joe> lol
[0:06:09] <HereComestheChief> The only RustleMania TOO BIG for one night!
[0:06:12] <+NickHatesSnow> buy on sale bb
[0:06:14] <+zooeymainbtw> @papa_bearman they are not, you need a whole bunch of stuff and the right vpn to be actually safe
[0:06:15] <Prevot> more expensive games will hurt anything that's not AAA
[0:06:20] <$BallerSwagBro9k> nice
[0:06:29] <%Invlux> oog
[0:06:32] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> VPNs help but need more tools to have total privacy. But if they're letting you install software on work computers then fuck it you're safe
[0:06:33] <+zooeymainbtw> but they are a good start
[0:06:33] <%generalve> WHAT
[0:06:35] <%robobeau> I thin kfor an ENOURMOUS game like GTA, I'd be OK with a $70 price tag, but for something like a Mario game, probably not?
[0:06:36] <mujahideenfruityrebels> The beatings will continue until moral improves
[0:06:37] <%ringabal> Always buy at 60% off sale or better
[0:06:38] <%SomersaultJustice> DKC or SF4, choose
[0:06:41] <+Rosen_Thorne> speaking of DKC, hey, that's on switch now!
[0:06:42] <+bokutachi_san> That fake Thousand Year Door tweet killed my soul :(
[0:07:01] <GenericSoda> I'd pick DKC
[0:07:01] <+Rosen_Thorne> does DKC have hakan? no sir, i think not. @SomersaultJustice
[0:07:06] <+Dimfish> games are still the cheapest form of entertainment out there for hours to dollars ratio
[0:07:07] <%Ranryu692> Ranryu692 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! I'm an anime watcher, so I'm sorry if someone has said this already: I googled X-Nauts to see if there is a consensus pronunciation, and while there isn't, I did find out that in the demo they were called Boomer Gangers, so do with that what you will lol
[0:07:08] <Prevot> GTA will sell even at 100, but Yakuza will struggle with just 10 more
[0:07:09] <%robobeau> SF4
[0:07:25] <JetpackMcQuack> In the end, this is just a markets thing unfortunately.
[0:07:27] <+Snipershot489> and people are still getting paid shit wages lol
[0:07:29] <%Graem> I can't afford games at one hundred Canadian and that's right where we are going
[0:07:29] <%SomersaultJustice> @Rosen_Thorne but he's talking about vanilla sf4 tho
[0:07:32] <petwisk> Master Race
[0:07:38] <Papa_Bearman> I already don't buy games at full-price; this is still pretty fucking disgusting considering lootbox culture.
[0:07:41] <jetstreamlover_ryocan> also straight up canging to the Switch
[0:07:49] <GenericSoda> @ranryu there's evidence it's pronounced cross much later on
[0:07:50] <+Rosen_Thorne> @SomersaultJustice ...touche.
[0:08:08] <%SirGO0SE> its a good thing that theres too many games now and theres no need to spend that much
[0:08:22] <Warbot40> Welp, origami king looks pretty meh
[0:08:32] <+magiclottie> Stacking BP is honestly the way to go
[0:08:36] <%starzo0> BP gang
[0:08:45] <+magiclottie> you can beat the game at 10 HP with little difficulty
[0:08:46] <%SirGO0SE> bp = best points
[0:08:53] <%SomersaultJustice> beeps
[0:08:58] <+phd_in_thuggery> BP = Benis Points
[0:09:00] <Papa_Bearman> I want to try four runs straight - balanced, HP only, BP only, and FP only. FP only sounds like Super Hard Mode to me.
[0:09:06] <%ringabal> Mario takes one step and his overalls start clacking with the weight of badges
[0:09:08] <mujahideenfruityrebels> Enabling Woolie’s addiction to BP
[0:09:12] <%Th3SmartAlec> ...Or you can just equip HP Plus
[0:09:18] <Prevot> there were bigger concerns at the beginning cause you were shit at action commands
[0:09:19] <milhousego> so how far do ya'll think we'll get today? also what chapter are we on again?
[0:09:20] <yogsbac0n> Stack Pickle Stone
[0:09:22] <%geekyNsalty> geekyNsalty subscribed with Twitch Prime.
[0:09:24] <sneekypotato> !runtime
[0:09:25] <ptmpopulatethemoon> I love just hearing woolie just talking about stuff.
[0:09:27] <+magiclottie> the HP and FP plus badges are kind of wastes tbh
[0:09:27] <petwisk> but quite franckly you should remove HP Plus
[0:09:42] <%SomersaultJustice> just be perfect 4Head
[0:09:43] <%SirGO0SE> get gud oneguy :)
[0:09:44] <GenericSoda> hp and fp plus are fine early
[0:09:46] <+magiclottie> i speak as someone who has played the game a lot, it's better to just get more damage out there without using those badges
[0:09:54] <+Snipershot489> I think you'll see as you go further into the chapters
[0:09:57] <%Solidnick18> ok
[0:10:04] <shiny_prinny> you can always just grind hp plus so it's all good
[0:10:06] <%cobalt_phoenix_> Now get ready for a flood of HP comments on the next level up
[0:10:11] <@akuda_bar> woolie's plant hoodie grew on me. get it, it grew on me
[0:10:13] <mige_> 10hp runs are fun
[0:10:15] <%Ecchigun> woolieVS
[0:10:17] <+Snipershot489> Woolie you just fucking jinxed yourself
[0:10:20] <Prevot> you totally died
[0:10:25] <+magiclottie> honestly, if woolie stays low HP? he just needs super shrooms and life shrooms
[0:10:27] <%starzo0> @akuda_bar booo
[0:10:29] <%Hawk_Rush> woolie's now gonna get wiped next fight LUL
[0:10:30] <%Ecchigun> sup
[0:10:30] <DatAsuna> yes
[0:10:31] <DragonSpooker> The Bombs
[0:10:31] <+zooeymainbtw> ye
[0:10:32] <%Th3SmartAlec> BIG WIPE
[0:10:34] <+phd_in_thuggery> FP & BP over HP in all runs imo
[0:10:34] <+Euphbugg> yup
[0:10:35] <%doombawkzvs> The bombs
[0:10:36] <shiny_prinny> only lost to bombs but you can't game over in the Pit
[0:10:37] <%cobalt_phoenix_> once, and that's because you were frozen
[0:10:37] <Prevot> you got 1-shot by bob-ombs
[0:10:40] <rubbishbinge> insta bomb wipe out
[0:10:40] <%chll0ne> tfw atlus finally ports smt 1 to switch but its japan only woolieDATTEBAYO
[0:10:41] <%Exiliator> Woolie justifying his paper mario build like if he was asked a question on tv talking about his political campaign LUL
[0:10:45] <+phd_in_thuggery> big ACCIDENT
[0:10:45] <Papa_Bearman> A death in the Glitz Pit isn't a "game over", but yes.
[0:10:48] <%cobalt_phoenix_> DOESN'T COUNT
[0:10:49] <%Hawk_Rush> @Exiliator LUL
[0:10:49] <milhousego> what chapter are we on?
[0:10:49] <%SomersaultJustice> he was booked to job that fight
[0:10:54] <%Th3SmartAlec> Doesn't count because Kayfabe
[0:10:57] <%ringabal> In hindsight Multibounce may not have been the best move
[0:11:01] <%elbigante> that was a mechanical wipe, not a difficulty thing
[0:11:01] <NotHereToStream> end of chapter 3
[0:11:01] <petwisk> @genericsoda is Trading a level for another is Just a waste of 3 badge points
[0:11:03] <%Proxzo> Bombs were a tactic not stats
[0:11:06] <Shwepie> Bomb wipe was more failing a mechanic than not having the right stats.
[0:11:06] <rubbishbinge> its a baby game so ultimately its fine
[0:11:12] <Zeif00> They do have Quick Change atm, effectively massive amounts of hp
[0:11:14] <CrypticMochi> Those complaints sound people complaining about Liam running a defensive set in Paper Mario
[0:11:26] <JetpackMcQuack> I haven't gotten trapped in an RPG since I was 10
[0:11:29] <%dmcRedgrave> Also if I'm being honest, I think a lot of the people talking about the difficulty scaling up are remembering when they were kids and struggled, as opposed to full-grown adults.
[0:11:30] <+McSoliace> a lot of people are scared of losing
[0:11:44] <+magiclottie> honestly, at the end of the day if woolie keeps saving the game like he does?
[0:11:48] <+magiclottie> he's gonna be fine
[0:11:51] <%Exiliator> oh yeah that one
[0:11:53] <%tigerfang86> yo
[0:11:56] <%kingkeldeo31> OOOH
[0:11:57] <%tigerfang86> that sounds extreme
[0:12:01] <%Invlux> OH SHIT that manga is great
[0:12:02] <%ringabal> JACK ON
[0:12:03] <%FenixSeraph> PogChamp yeah it's got great art
[0:12:05] <Zeif00> It's good
[0:12:07] <alephalpha> it's weird but it's really good
[0:12:08] <%FenixSeraph> also Amy Winehouse shows up
[0:12:09] <Prevot> wat
[0:12:11] <Zeif00> Read it everyone
[0:12:12] <thegreatbambe> whats the name?
[0:12:13] <GenericSoda> @petwisk it depends on what youre up against, i guess. if you need hp to survive then its worth it
[0:12:17] <%Druuplays_> “The fear of losing will cause you to lose at life”- some guy
[0:12:18] <%AlteisenReiseZ> It’s honestly amazing
[0:12:20] <mujahideenfruityrebels> Sounds retarded
[0:12:23] <Zeif00> Kurt Cobain is there
[0:12:28] <%AlteisenReiseZ> MUSIC STAND BATTLES
[0:12:28] <%kingkeldeo31> Shiori experience @thegreatbambe
[0:12:30] <DatAsuna> seems in poor taste
[0:12:31] <Zeif00> MUSIC STANDS
[0:12:32] <rubbishbinge> sounds like shaman king
[0:12:35] <%Exiliator> I mean, they are still dead
[0:12:38] <pixel_river> that sounds chill
[0:12:39] <%SomersaultJustice> Mic Stands
[0:12:41] <%Invlux> oh no, no reincarnation
[0:12:43] <alephalpha> no reincarnation but we use histircal people as characters all over the place
[0:12:50] <%ringabal> "No, Jimmy. You are not jacking into my neck again."
[0:12:50] <%Exiliator> they are just getting coached by ghosts
[0:12:52] <+phd_in_thuggery> It focuses on the dynamic of building a band learning to improve yourself.
[0:12:53] <%Invlux> the ghost just hangs out
[0:12:53] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:13:02] <%Graem> Recently dead. Gotta be dead for a hundred years min
[0:13:07] <%doombawkzvs> @WoolieVersus Have you seen DMC (Detroit Metal City)?
[0:13:07] <niozonbi> Doesn't we do that with war heroes all the time?
[0:13:10] <DatAsuna> mild take: calling something a stand makes me instantly stop taking you seriously
[0:13:11] <Zeif00> Yeah they just hang and play music through people
[0:13:13] <Prevot> hopefully ghost MJ isn't hanging out with a young japanese boy too
[0:13:16] <%SirGO0SE> idk woolie youre selling it pretty well right now
[0:13:17] <+Deano8817> Are we sure Kira isn't actually david bowie tho?
[0:13:18] <EL_TRO> what ya'll talking about?
[0:13:18] <%FenixSeraph> be glad Kurt Cobain isn't a 12 year old girl
[0:13:19] <alephalpha> think about ti being a sports manag about doing what you liove and responsibilites other stuff it works prettyw ell as a whole
[0:13:21] <%Druuplays_> I hate to be that guy but does anyone else hear a ring?
[0:13:21] <ProfessorLuigi> BUT THINK ABOUT how COOL THAT WOULD BE
[0:13:21] <dreadedcthulhu> reminds me of when Barack Obama showed up in air gear
[0:13:24] <%jiggy_snipe> that sounds pretty cool
[0:13:28] <petwisk> @genericsoda i generaly resolve that by smartly spending my levels (2 levels Badge points folowed by 1 FP and one HP)
[0:13:30] <noobpsyboticus> that'd be awesome though

[0:14:03] <+Dimfish> this game is not voice acted, its pronounced however the fuck you like
[0:14:07] <Louie_Salmon> Key Nauts
[0:14:10] <+magiclottie> X naut is just public perception, cross nauts doesnt roll off the tongue
[0:14:11] <Drusain> Chi Nauts yeah
[0:14:11] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @phd_in_thuggery
[0:14:13] <+Dimfish> it is NOT chi nauts
[0:14:13] <%elbigante> don't they make ecks puns
[0:14:14] <warp_zoner> Cross-naut just sounds dumb im sorry
[0:14:15] <GenericSoda> it's absolutely cross nauts, theres evidence
[0:14:16] <%Exiliator> I've always said ex nauts myself, but from what I've seen after, its more likely cross nauts
[0:14:16] <Prevot> it's actually 10 in Roman
[0:14:18] <EL_TRO> cross zone

[0:16:26] <rubbishbinge> why would you
[0:16:40] <%Graem> QA is no longer a leadin to a real vg job and hasn't been for many years
[0:16:46] <%Slimshazbot> Slimshazbot subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! Hey Woolie! What is your favorite mech SIZE? I love me a good towering stupid big robot, but my ideal would probably be the size of Titans in Titanfall.
[0:16:48] <%Hawk_Rush> I did QA (not video game tho), was able to become a software engineer through doing it
[0:17:02] <%Druuplays_> @persona_ex wait if you’re not using headphones you might not hear it
[0:17:05] <+phd_in_thuggery> my dad constantly told me "Video Game QA is where careers go to die"
[0:17:26] <%ringabal> QA sounds like the dishwashers of the game industry
[0:17:35] <+TheRisingPride> If you are willing to hate life for a few years, video game QA is wonderful to get in the door
[0:17:47] <%Th3SmartAlec> @phd_in_thuggery Your Dad looking at Woolie: "What form of power is this?!"
[0:17:48] <+TheRisingPride> But you're not allowed to leave the doormat.
[0:17:49] <JetpackMcQuack> Just be aware that it is the "Salmon swimming up a river" approach
[0:17:58] <+CounterBeard> QA was how my buddy ended up as a voice actor/voice director. But he also busted his ass for years to get there.
[0:18:08] <%doombawkzvs> QA isn't a bad thing but it pays like garbage, but it'll give you industry experience. Crunches, long hours, bug finding, so on
[0:18:11] <%Theycallmenerf> What is up chat
[0:18:23] <%Exiliator> And you get to see the dark side of video games
[0:18:31] <+phd_in_thuggery> @th3smartalec to be fair he did have a few friends who went into it and they ended up leaving or becoming homeless in LA
[0:18:32] <%Exiliator> Dont work were you eat!
[0:18:35] <%Theycallmenerf> I was curious about QA jobs since I had some offers on them.
[0:18:43] <%FusRoDom> Junior Roles are EXTREMELY rare though... Everyone is hiring Senior positions these days because devs are getting burned out and leaving.
[0:18:49] <+phd_in_thuggery> so that was his exposure to QA work
[0:19:02] <%Th3SmartAlec> @phd_in_thuggery oof

[0:20:18] <$Superdandy96> We need a !Crunch command

[0:21:32] <%Proxzo> QA can lead to Production. Then from Producer you can be Lead Producer. From Lead Producer to Executive.

[0:21:36] <%ringabal> Isn't it nutz that these hardcore jobs are solely dedicated towards public entertainment?
[0:21:40] <%doombawkzvs> @WoolieVersus Once you reach a certain point, you need to make horizontal moves. QA only goes up to a certain point before you need to switch departments.
[0:21:49] <%Druuplays_> From the corner to kingpin
[0:21:58] <+TheRisingPride> Oh, 2 One Guys
[0:22:17] <+magiclottie> @WoolieVersus can you keep talking for like 15 more minutes so i can make lunch? JK

[0:22:21] <%cobalt_phoenix_> so qa is the mailroom then?
[0:22:32] <RichochetForce> @JetpackMcQuack Exactly. Businesses are NOT loyal.
[0:22:45] <%Theycallmenerf> How far can running PR for a game dev company go upwards or horizontal?
[0:22:49] <%StaceMcGate> re suu meh

[0:46:16] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> No Respec in this game btw
[0:46:19] <+phd_in_thuggery> it helps the LP a bit and at least truncates some of the more tedious aspects of this game
[0:46:26] <%Th3SmartAlec> @PkSilent01 We are right after Rawk
[0:46:44] <+geosspone> FIRE DRIVE YES
[0:46:47] <missingangle> IT IS

[0:46:50] <%Graem> "What about j-list?" Kappa
[0:46:55] <thetntm> I've heard it's the best attack in the game
[0:46:57] <rubbishbinge> POWAH WAVE

[0:47:28] <missingangle> It's simply an improved Quake hammer, straight up
[0:47:28] <+QuadraticGravity> But you still have Quake equipped
[0:47:29] <%Daniel_Is_I> Fire Drive can't hit roof enemies, doesn't flip enemies, and there are fire-immune enemies, but otherwise IT'S GREAT
[0:47:29] <niozonbi> You'll have enough BP for both by that point
[0:47:30] <%Th3SmartAlec> ResidentSleeper
[0:47:32] <%Solareon_> ResidentSleeper

[1:55:12] <%Hawk_Rush> @SoushinSen yo minh
[1:55:12] <%cdrom321> Amber alert: Paper Mario has stolen my childlike innocence.
[1:55:13] <JonKhan> Sleeping during the day sucks when amber alerts are a thing.
[1:55:15] <%Nomad94> what's an amber alert
[1:55:15] <+Zenryoku21> lots of amber alerts in midwest
[1:55:15] <nyacoo> There is (1) Smash player in the vicinity
[1:55:15] <%Invlux> Minh got it too
[1:55:16] <%Solidnick18> i was sleeping when it went off
[1:55:17] <Syrushmx> what is that?
[1:55:17] <glass_marcus> Imagine only having only one amber alert in your life
[1:55:17] <%crimsonphoenix69> I had it too
[1:55:18] <letshavecakes> Damn those meadows

[1:55:24] <@Menitta> wtf
[1:55:24] <LaikaCDP> cause ya'll in canada in the US we get em all the time
[1:55:25] <citerel> having a bunch of people get one in a classroom is an experience
[1:55:27] <%exnuart> you should be freaked out when theres a missing kid
[1:55:27] <Papa_Bearman> I remember a couple years ago when Trump mandated pretty much everyone's phone goes off at the same time. Super annoying, and he hasn't used it since.
[1:55:28] <%Solidnick18> yeah
[1:55:31] <straycatrock> as a non-north american amber alerts are fucking weird to me
[1:55:31] <@SoushinSen> i was like... What the fuck is this alarm sound like it's the end of the world? i couldn't tell where the sound came from
[1:55:32] <%Cozy90> in L.A. i saw them too often :(
[1:55:32] <%HitchhikingThrough> @WoolieVersus US amber alerts are a PITA

[1:55:54] <bbblaketwitching> thats bad enough to make me laugh
[1:55:56] <%Invlux> If you've ever got an amber alert while in a grocery store, it's wild bc it all goes off at once
[1:55:56] <%MontresorMeal> Oh, the nuclear launch thing.
[1:56:01] <%SuperKirby24> yea that was amega oof
[1:56:01] <%Graem> That missile alert was terrifying
[1:56:02] <%neroforte177> theres a lot in texas

[1:56:06] <JetpackMcQuack> go inside i guess monkaS
[1:56:06] <bbblaketwitching> it wrapped around twice
[1:56:07] <%exnuart> some dude fucked his sister during that hawaii missle thing
[1:56:10] <%FuqBoiSlim> I havent gotten an amber alert in like 6 months but that might be just cuz I dont update my phone
[1:56:16] <%Doplghost> I remember the guy who called the alert said that "he did what he was trained to do."
[1:56:18] <%emeraldskrull> woolieDATTEBAYO woolieTRASH woolieGASM
[1:56:18] <+phd_in_thuggery> I got an Amber Alert a few months ago that nearly made me crash my car, shit was fucked

[2:10:54] <%RadicalWeegee> its EEHH
[2:10:56] <bbblaketwitching> THERE ARE BADGES TO HELP
[2:10:57] <NiktenKing> Hammerman is not worth
[2:10:57] <+TheRisingPride> Not worth
[2:10:58] <+lethallylactic> Jumpman is better once you get some more badges
[2:11:00] <shiny_prinny> it's gimmicky
[2:11:00] <lotharrio> I can see where Jumpman might be worth it.
[2:11:00] <+geosspone> Throwing Hammer makes it worth
[2:11:02] <%Daniel_Is_I> Jumpman is better but you need certain badges
[2:11:03] <Papa_Bearman> Get Jumpman and Hammerman and equip both.
[2:11:04] <Shwepie> Jumpman > Hammerman
[2:11:08] <bbblaketwitching> There are badges to make jumping always viable
[2:11:10] <SpeedyCloud17> whatever you think is best Woolie! doodGood
[2:11:11] <+marumariball> yeah jumpman is better
[2:11:13] <HeavyC4> jumpman is better once you get a few other badges
[2:11:13] <%ozmon> Sounds like a fun build though, I've never tried that before
[2:11:14] <delta278899> There was a star piece by the trash can in west rougeport.

[2:11:52] <shiny_prinny> NO
[2:11:53] <%Daniel_Is_I> NO
[2:11:53] <%Proxzo> You get coins

[2:11:56] <%Invlux> PogChamp
[2:11:56] <%Proxzo> Yes
[2:11:57] <HeavyC4> you get coins

[2:11:58] <+Ancopro> basically anyone that only gives you one star point
[2:11:59] <Papa_Bearman> No.
[2:11:59] <Louie_Salmon> You get coins I think?
[2:11:59] <Bguy32> You get Coins
[2:12:00] <+QuadraticGravity> Coins, no XP
[2:12:00] <+lethallylactic> You do get coins
[2:12:00] <GenericSoda> you get money or items sometimes
[2:12:00] <jettsetter> no xp
[2:12:01] <%StaceMcGate> NO, only coins
[2:12:01] <+TheRisingPride> You get coins but not exp
[2:12:02] <+Zeromaru2> No
[2:12:02] <bbblaketwitching> NOT EXP
[2:12:03] <%CursedNobleman> No. Also L EMBLEM.
[2:12:04] <%chosenjuan42> good for backtracking
[2:12:05] <%Proxzo> A few coins
[2:12:05] <SoupBowler> It's only for weaker enemies who don't give XP
[2:12:06] <%Javaa01> You don't get XP, you just get money
[2:12:06] <+FistOcuffs9> no, only coins
[2:12:06] <+LoVezineTheAir> just coins
[2:12:08] <RichochetForce> Coins only
[2:12:09] <+Wilabeen1997> Coins
[2:12:09] <Hyper_charger> no reward
[2:12:10] <SixthSun2> Everything without EXP, but you'd only get 1 EXP anyways
[2:12:10] <+pectusumbra> It's for enemies that don't give xp
[2:12:14] <twieetcha> Coins only
[2:12:14] <DatAsuna> The pit gives you one like this for free later
[2:12:15] <HeavyC4> but the first attack SAVES TIME
[2:12:17] <+QuadraticGravity> @CursedNobleman Too early.
[2:12:17] <+thunka10> if the WHOLE FIGHT would give 1 xp, it gives coins
[2:12:18] <%Proxzo> weak enemies dont give EXP anyways
[2:12:20] <bbblaketwitching> JUMPING IS ALWAYS BEST
[2:12:20] <+FistOcuffs9> theyre too weak, so they wouldnt give xp anyway
[2:12:22] <NiktenKing> Still worth
[2:12:22] <+VorpalSlash> You wouldn't get XP regardless
[2:12:22] <+TheRisingPride> You probably would only get 1 anyway
[2:12:22] <CastellanVon> Weaker enemies don't give xp
[2:12:22] <NextTime000> Gale Force is full exp too
[2:12:22] <RichochetForce> Correct
[2:12:22] <TheHotStuven> For enemies that dont give real EXP
[2:12:22] <+zooeymainbtw> ye
[2:12:23] <Louie_Salmon> Enemies wouldn't really give it anyway, yeah
[2:12:23] <bbblaketwitching> thats true
[2:12:23] <shiny_prinny> it's for when the world map is getting annoying to traverse
[2:12:25] <%cdrom321> This applies to enemies that wouldn't give Star Points anyway.
[2:12:25] <%chosenjuan42> ITS GOOD FOR BACKTRACKING
[2:12:27] <%CursedNobleman> @QuadraticGravity :( Drat
[2:12:27] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:12:28] <+Grayhammatter> i mean, it'd be only 1 point
[2:12:28] <%Hawk_Rush> yep
[2:12:28] <+GreenCMD> it only cancels fights with 1 xp
[2:12:29] <+Ancopro> good for back tracking yup
[2:12:29] <NiktenKing> Coins for badges and items
[2:12:29] <+FistOcuffs9> its not really worth it
[2:12:33] <+pectusumbra> Just bop em
[2:12:34] <niozonbi> Doesn't work in the pit tho
[2:12:38] <%Druuplays_> It saves time
[2:12:41] <BlackermanZX> delete the weak
[2:12:41] <%Proxzo> Weak enemies dont give exp anyways
[2:12:41] <Papa_Bearman> Just boop that snoot.
[2:12:46] <%Invlux> that's amazing
[2:12:47] <+LoVezineTheAir> only wear it when backtracking tho
[2:12:53] <+Wilabeen1997> If the fight would give only 1 xp, totally worth
[2:13:02] <%donpatrondx> fdont wear in new areas
[2:13:04] <bbblaketwitching> WHICH IS MUCH BETTER

[2:13:22] <%MasterMushin> Yeah do it!
[2:13:24] <shiny_prinny> i think you would just lose both commands lol
[2:13:25] <niozonbi> YEYE
[2:13:27] <+VorpalSlash> Do it Kappa
[2:13:28] <+TheRisingPride> Wouldn't equipping both just make it so you can't use either
[2:13:28] <%chosenjuan42> can't do both
[2:13:29] <Syrushmx> NOUP
[2:13:29] <%Proxzo> yea then just equip power plus for that
[2:13:29] <+Wilabeen1997> Nope
[2:13:30] <+QuadraticGravity> It doesn't -1, it deletes your commands tho
[2:13:34] <ElbyBoxus> it doesnt minus power tho it just denies
[2:13:35] <Papa_Bearman> Your attack power would go up by 2 but you couldn't attack.
[2:13:35] <Cynical_Canadian> Do you still need timing tutor?
[2:13:36] <%Pop_O_Matic> Yeah, if you use both you end not being able to attack
[2:13:36] <+Grayhammatter> reggie, don't listen to chat LUL

[2:14:15] <Cynical_Canadian> Refund
[2:14:16] <Louie_Salmon> Oh yeah, refund
[2:14:17] <%ozmon> There's also some enemies that are impervious to fire
[2:14:18] <+QuadraticGravity> @WoolieVersus You can remove Charge, the buff just isn't good enough to lose a turn on attacks.
[2:14:19] <NextTime000> cause gale force is kind of bustedly powerful
[2:14:21] <SixthSun2> Refund?
[2:14:25] <+thunka10> Refund for sure

[2:50:34] <+marumariball> max out BP
[2:50:35] <%tigerfang86> one damage is HUGE though
[2:50:36] <delta278899> There's a star piece by the trash can in west rougeport.
[2:50:36] <+TheRisingPride> trade your HP and FP up badge for POWER
[2:50:38] <%marshalmorphino2> UNLIMITED POWER
[2:50:39] <+marumariball> would be a good idea for builds
[2:50:41] <bbblaketwitching> thats 6 damage with multibounce
[2:50:42] <%astrofalcon1> customize your mario
[2:50:45] <+Ancopro> you using appeal?
[2:50:46] <+geosspone> HP Plus is a scam
[2:50:48] <HeavyC4> Appeal can go to hell
[2:50:49] <Louie_Salmon> Charge is good for bosses
[2:50:50] <KatabolicRage> super appeal can probably be dropped, it's a bit niche
[2:50:51] <Afterman_> take off both apeals!!
[2:50:51] <+Rosen_Thorne> wouldn't the attack up negate the charge?
[2:50:53] <HenryHenshin> did you get the bag upgrade yet?
[2:50:54] <%ozmon> LOL
[2:50:54] <HeavyC4> HP plus can go straight to hell
[2:50:54] <Zeif00> sack appeal
[2:50:55] <Bguy32> Take of HP Plus
[2:50:58] <%Th3SmartAlec> Hp Plus, first strike
[2:50:58] <+Ancopro> TRUE
[2:51:00] <rubbishbinge> do it
[2:51:00] <CastellanVon> Get rid of the appeals and first attack, super niche
[2:51:00] <twieetcha> Who needs hp?
[2:51:01] <TheHotStuven> HP and appeal?
[2:51:01] <%astrofalcon1> a HOT 6
[2:51:02] <JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[2:51:02] <glass_marcus> DO IT
[2:51:03] <%Proxzo> The best defense is OFFENSE
[2:51:04] <bbblaketwitching> fp matters
[2:51:06] <+krispen_wa> DO IT
[2:51:07] <Run44forrest> hp plus fp plus
[2:51:07] <Papa_Bearman> You only need five.
[2:51:07] <%Cozy90> JUST DONT GET HIT
[2:51:08] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Glass canon it?
[2:51:09] <twieetcha> Garbage stat HP is
[2:51:09] <%elbigante> take off super appeal and first attack
[2:51:12] <HeavyC4> first attack and super appeal
[2:51:12] <+geosspone> both appeals and HP Plus
[2:51:13] <%ozmon> I can't fit Power Plus into my schedule... OR CAN I...?
[2:51:14] <+Rosen_Thorne> Stylish makes up for the super appeals
[2:51:15] <+thunka10> Drop the appeals
[2:51:16] <reonome> first atttack
[2:51:16] <+marumariball> you can get appeal from all the stylish actions
[2:51:18] <Run44forrest> do it coward
[2:51:19] <HeavyC4> Both appeals and HP plus
[2:51:23] <+CharredChord> don't get hit 4Head
[2:51:23] <+gespenst25> is 30 the most you can ever have?
[2:51:25] <Louie_Salmon> Could take away HP plus, and maybe some small things?
[2:51:26] <niozonbi> Timing tutor and first attack
[2:51:29] <%astrofalcon1> time to do some 4d chess
[2:51:30] <HenryHenshin> timing tutor
[2:51:30] <Bguy32> Get rid of Tutor
[2:51:32] <twieetcha> Do it. Get rid of HP
[2:51:33] <+Juriasu> get rid of damage dodge?
[2:51:34] <%exnuart> super appeals aren't great
[2:51:35] <+Sunriser41> appeals + hp
[2:51:35] <Afterman_> damage dodge?
[2:51:41] <lotharrio> Appeals, First strike.
[2:51:42] <yusefHD> select your assist type OhMyDog OhMyDog OhMyDog OhMyDog
