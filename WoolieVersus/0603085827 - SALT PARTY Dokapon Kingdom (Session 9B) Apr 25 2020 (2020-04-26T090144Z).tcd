[0:06:14] <%yeetdabsenpai69> YOU FOOL
[0:06:16] <%Amaideus> @Disc0rdance1 It's still there for me
[0:06:16] <+b_aleph> Why?
[0:06:17] <+Dimfish> reggie not readin stats
[0:06:19] <%Th3SmartAlec> Woolie, RED TREE
[0:06:20] <%optimasmaximas> foolishness reggie
[0:06:24] <%andrei11dr> If he steals money he can get it back immediately, if he takes the weapon he can take it back immediately so it's not as bad as it seems
[0:06:26] <+soFISHticated98> well the stats were nominally better
[0:06:26] <WizardofWazz> RED TREE
[0:06:26] <+b_aleph> You had 30% bonus
[0:06:26] <NWannabe> wait...did reggie take anything?
[0:06:28] <Shishi1205> Warrior based lmao
[0:06:28] <C4m3r0n0409> red tree
[0:06:29] <%emperordread> Reggie isn't warrior class, he doesn't get the 30%
[0:06:33] <TigerClaws12> LUCK IS A SKILL
[0:06:35] <+gutlesscoward> Red Tree
[0:06:38] <Daba_mk2> Reggie is a ninja tho
[0:06:40] <%Amaideus> Warrior based class
[0:06:40] <Disc0rdance1> @Amaideus weird it's gone for me
[0:06:41] <%jiggy_snipe> Ninja is warrior based apparently
[0:06:41] <C4m3r0n0409> RED TREE
[0:06:41] <+soFISHticated98> Ninja is overclass of Warrior and Thief
[0:06:43] <+HDmexiqtioner> How much percentage wise are they in the game?
[0:06:44] <%Hawkbone_> Reggie is warrior-based, Ninja need warrior and thief
[0:06:45] <%Th3SmartAlec> Transfer is nice
[0:06:46] <+soFISHticated98> so he gets the Warrior bonus
[0:06:47] <jubejube56> Tower of God
[0:06:52] <%xcompleasedad> The bonus shit is rare? for thieves
[0:06:54] <%Solidnick18> he did
[0:06:55] <%emperordread> oh I didn't know @soFISHticated98
[0:07:00] <+b_aleph> @emperordread ninja is warrior based and thief based
[0:07:00] <+soFISHticated98> s'all good
[0:07:03] <%viewtifulr> Its all woolie fault
[0:07:03] <%agumon9000> @WoolieVersus Its not a random drop. There is a red tree deep into the cave and you need to go to the blank space with the red tree.
[0:07:05] <+soFISHticated98> game is opque as fuck
[0:07:06] <%viewtifulr> Kappa
[0:07:08] <NWannabe> @jubejube56 Great manhwa, how is the cartoon?
[0:07:09] <+Dimfish> reggie did get really fucked last time, its upsetting
[0:07:10] <%Solidnick18> that was the balance
[0:07:26] <+mmack093> Woolie is the one who deserves to win
[0:07:27] <%Th3SmartAlec> How long until Woolie remembers the tree?
[0:07:27] <jubejube56> Seems solid thus far; apparently it is moving quickly
[0:07:30] <+pectusumbra> ninja training
[0:07:38] <C4m3r0n0409> 2ND FLOOR
[0:07:40] <+kekkerscrew> Reggie got rid of the weapon from his best friend Gutz
[0:07:44] <NWannabe> what ep are they on?
[0:07:44] <C4m3r0n0409> GO TO SECOND FLOOR
[0:07:51] <+Grayhammatter> no one tell him
[0:07:55] <%emperordread> If Minh uses Ninja Magic, is it called Minhjutsu?
[0:07:56] <NWannabe> I'm waiting more for God of High School
[0:08:02] <%agumon9000> @WoolieVersus Its not a random drop! There is a red tree deep into the cave and you need to go to the blank space with the red tree.

[0:14:35] <%blastazoid00> Minh the HERO
[0:14:39] <+kekkerscrew> It's an endgame class.
[0:14:42] <%Th3SmartAlec> MINH
[0:14:45] <President_valentine> Hero takes too much work
[0:14:46] <%prime_name> Is Reveal one time?
[0:14:47] <NWannabe> Ah, so we just totally cheating to help Minh now?
[0:14:48] <%yeetdabsenpai69> CHEATING
[0:14:55] <+pectusumbra> there is a weapon with robo-knight in the store, so it's fine to just say it at this point
[0:14:56] <DiscoDur0> To be fair, the description of angel wings states that you take it to the top of the Daunting Mountain
[0:14:56] <%Hawkbone_> Guys, its fine. They would never have found out otherwise.
[0:15:00] <+bear_breaker20> would have been cooler if minh kept that secret
[0:15:01] <%nintega010> thank god someone tells them this.
[0:15:01] <%yeetdabsenpai69> MINH QUAD ARE CHEATERS
[0:15:06] <%Th3SmartAlec> Robo Knight is totally obtainable later on
[0:15:06] <+Dimfish> lets just spoil the whole fucking game for them why dont we
[0:15:15] <+Metaknightmarex> idk how much time i wasted trying to get hero in my run through...
[0:15:17] <%jiggy_snipe> also Minh was never gonna go up that mountain unless he was in super 1st
[0:15:17] <%Hawkbone_> Its not spoilers, you baby
[0:15:17] <Mr_Ease> to be honest its good that folks know that classes need requirements because they won't waste their time
[0:15:18] <+soFISHticated98> damn calm down y'all
[0:15:19] <DaBigVitus> meh this is necessary info
[0:15:19] <%BisoromiBear> We're Minh it to winh it.
[0:15:21] <iggeh> @DiscoDur0 that doesn't really tell you much
[0:15:24] <kulmoth> Team MInh are cheaters :(
[0:15:26] <+therabbles> the holy text

[0:15:40] <DiscoDur0> @iggeh yeah, just caught the rest of that, bummer
[0:15:42] <%fetrigon> Dude is Dokapon there's a ton of asspulls left in the game
[0:15:42] <%Amaideus> Ain't Minh's fault people told him shit
[0:15:44] <%Irridium> I mean they were probably never were gonna go for lost technology anyway so that's no loss. And Minh seems to not care for the angel wings so... nothing's really lost
[0:15:45] <+soFISHticated98> and it's stuff they all had access to anyways
[0:15:47] <+InfiniteHav0k> Honestly they should know job requirements. The wouldnt get the new jobs otherwise
[0:15:50] <+Dimfish> its not minhs fault people DMd him this shit
[0:15:50] <%Hawkbone_> Chat are a bunch of big fucking babies
[0:15:52] <+soFISHticated98> because it's in the google doc they were given
[0:15:54] <%Th3SmartAlec> Robo knight ain't eactly secret since it's on items
[0:15:57] <DaBigVitus> this is no big deal
[0:15:59] <+bear_breaker20> fucking one guy
[0:16:00] <Monkeyweed21> ANYTHING GOES IN THE BLOOD POOL

[0:22:54] <%Amaideus> Lmao
[0:22:57] <%djazo> LUL
[0:22:58] <%Th3SmartAlec> Useless since Minh and Reggie know
[0:22:59] <%Andrizzleton> NOPE
[0:23:01] <Josef_Stryker> LUL
[0:23:05] <%JeoDood> lame
[0:23:17] <%viewtifulr> One day when someone with high magic rolls up
[0:23:18] <%Amaideus> Now if enemies in the caves were throwing magic around, that might be useful
[0:23:20] <%djazo> LUL LUL LUL
[0:23:25] <%BirchFade> woolieS woolieT
[0:23:26] <+DesertPenguin> That was by half. Your little magic up only goes up by 2
[0:23:30] <%BirchFade> woolieF woolieU
[0:23:32] <+pectusumbra> woolie's still got way more magic than the other two. He can do an honest break out strat if he builds it
[0:23:34] <moonologist> FISH
[0:23:52] <%andrei11dr> Wait a minute ,the king can drop Drop it Like It's Hot references, but they can't say "hell" wtf
[0:23:53] <GMKGoat> So Reggie just warped Minh out of the dungeon so he can take all the towns and cement his lead further
[0:23:54] <moonologist> 0 is equity
[0:23:59] <+bear_breaker20> "how will i ever deal with woolie's high magic"
[0:24:01] <WizardofWazz> reggie should just go up north and re-capture/invest in his greenland continent
[0:24:12] <Shishi1205> is it 0 beacuse no town is saved?
[0:24:15] <NWannabe> @GMKGoat .....damn
[0:24:19] <%jiggy_snipe> Reggie is wasting his time like Woolie did underwater
[0:24:23] <+Gespens> for those confused as to why the Castle was worth 0 equity, Castles are worth double the most valuable town you own on the continent
[0:24:25] <HailtheKnife> Bruh
[0:24:25] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1252638347819986945
[0:24:25] <%Amaideus> It's 0 because you can't invest from the bank for castles
[0:24:35] <%viewtifulr> Watch it'll change when reggiee get darkling
[0:24:49] <%Amaideus> KANCHO THE GHOST

[0:25:49] <Shishi1205> yo prayer?
[0:25:56] <C4m3r0n0409> Chat quit yelling at chat
[0:25:57] <%EvanTheNewbie> Good choice
[0:25:57] <%agumon9000> Prayer heals your poison
[0:25:57] <%BirchFade> yeah willie definitely knows by now
[0:25:59] <mdkcde> Don't forget to upgrade your weapon
[0:26:00] <+Dimfish> youve never used soulfire
[0:26:01] <%deviljhojho_> blood
[0:26:01] <+InfiniteHav0k> but he just went into a loop lol
[0:26:04] <WizardofWazz> soul fire is arguably the best skill in the game
[0:26:07] <+AnthraxJohnson> Pupper snuffed
[0:26:08] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @C4m3r0n0409 reeeeeeeeeeee
[0:26:08] <mdkcde> nah you don't last agaisnt anyone
[0:26:09] <moonologist> prayer is better tho
[0:26:09] <+pectusumbra> they are both pretty good skills
[0:26:09] <NWannabe> nah, chat needs to be yelled at
[0:26:11] <+soFISHticated98> I dunno the amount of times you actualy use Soul Fire...
[0:26:11] <%Th3SmartAlec> @C4m3r0n0409 you first chat
[0:26:16] <+bear_breaker20> make sure to get the fetus a sword a big one
[0:26:20] <%jiggy_snipe> @InfiniteHav0k literally just left it and came back :)
[0:26:25] <%EvanTheNewbie> Gotta read those real careful
[0:26:27] <NickHatesSnow> prayer seems way better
[0:26:31] <C4m3r0n0409> LUL
[0:26:41] <%Th3SmartAlec> @soFISHticated98 It's only useful when you know that you'll be fighting for multiple turns
[0:26:56] <%Th3SmartAlec> Well, at least he's broke
[0:26:59] <WizardofWazz> soul fire, the round after you use it, youll have 255% more attack or so
[0:27:06] <%jiggy_snipe> go kill Minh again Reggie since he's broke noiw

[0:28:48] <PsychedelicSnake> Kreygasm
[0:28:49] <%nintega010> I still think woolie is stronger than minh he just needs a better weapon.
[0:28:49] <+soFISHticated98> wait did Minh buy a weapon when I wasn't looking
[0:28:51] <+gutlesscoward> i dunno, probably
[0:28:51] <+soFISHticated98> which one did he get

[0:30:05] <+Grayhammatter> get those towns back reggie
[0:30:05] <+DesertPenguin> Woolie, maybe you should read the game manual? Instead of just winging it
[0:30:07] <+soFISHticated98> but Minh has an instant kill/gravity and Reggie has insane attack
[0:30:07] <%jiggy_snipe> he can just go back to DK castle I guess

[0:51:05] <%Amaideus> No server to manage it
[0:51:07] <%Rabspat> Parsec would be the way to go for sure
[0:51:10] <+soFISHticated98> and if you can't figure out the save settings than what are you doing
[0:51:10] <%Irridium> well just gotta one-shot the story mode with 4 friends then 4Head

[0:51:23] <Cpsaint> for real?
[0:51:24] <SenpaiMD> its better to use parsec or another service similar. DK doesn't play well with netplay

[2:24:58] <vierleger> ABSOLUTE HORROR
[2:24:58] <countgaculatv> ABSOLUTE HORROR
[2:24:59] <+soFISHticated98> it's a trippy cartoon it is
[2:24:59] <NiktenKing> That's where you have to go Sora

[2:25:15] <thesickestzak> @chiluzza I tried playing Thursday on my ps4 pro with a friend and it crashed 3 times for us before we gave up. Game is unplayable for a lot of people
[2:25:18] <countgaculatv> Darkest Africa sounds like a location in a modern day RPG
[2:25:19] <trickquestionz> The Last Dodo? Did they have it there. In Darkest Africa?
[2:25:24] <%Superbro64> yes, rage IS the last dodo
[2:25:25] <%viewtifulr> 25 spaces until the reckoning
[2:25:26] <+Grayhammatter> get those castles
[2:25:28] <whitemage4life> Get some tortoise liver and smear it on dodo. that's good eaten
[2:25:34] <C4m3r0n0409> Theres never a bad time to be dark
[2:25:34] <Monkey_D_Judd> so thats where Woolie got his love of racism from, Darkest Africa
[2:25:36] <%KineKithZen> There were a few similar cartoons that had the "Dark/Darker/Darkest Africa" gag

[2:25:41] <%yeetdabsenpai69> 5 SPINNER
[2:25:43] <Mr_Ease> he has a lot of money though

[2:25:50] <%optimasmaximas> for anyone wondering the episode is called "Africa Squeaks"
[2:25:51] <+AnthraxJohnson> I think that cartoon is from the 60’s. Porky Pig is in it
[2:25:53] <%Th3SmartAlec> LOOP

[2:33:47] <%Th3SmartAlec> Unless Minh steals it
[2:34:00] <Reizie_Etherealm> Purse cut the contract LUL
[2:34:03] <%jiggy_snipe> the lockdown screwed everything up
[2:34:09] <+nekodelic> "until I get it, I don't have it" 4Head

[2:34:16] <%agumon9000> HOW DOES MINH KEEP DODGING THE FUCKING EQUIP BREAKING
[2:34:22] <+gutlesscoward> he basically has full control of how the game goes for the next few turns

[2:34:45] <%agumon9000> Bag unlocked
[2:34:57] <+Dimfish> woolie is literally gaslighting reggie right now
[2:34:58] <Reizie_Etherealm> Do you have any idea how fast Minh really is?? HE'S FAST AF BOI
[2:34:59] <samuraijakanddaxter> speed affecting the field magic and not actually the magic stat affecting it is pretty shit
[2:35:00] <+nekodelic> become mage
[2:35:06] <C4m3r0n0409> DARKLING DOESN'T HAVE BAG
[2:35:12] <DSD24> Speed is Life
[2:35:15] <+Gespens> You can't castle as Darkling
[2:35:16] <+bear_breaker20> @Dimfish art of war
[2:35:20] <+pectusumbra> I would like a modded rom of this game
[2:35:22] <+MrAtheGreat> I came back in just in time to be told not to get lost in silent hill.
[2:35:23] <%jiggy_snipe> just hang around the castle and wait for the contract
[2:35:30] <DSD24> Minh's got you in the Pipe 5 by 5
[2:35:32] <%viewtifulr> Fight magic with magic!
[2:35:33] <%kingkeldeo31> Speed affects accuracy, magic affects damage
[2:35:37] <%jiggy_snipe> if you get lockdown you'll heal yourself
[2:35:38] <RetroCop87> Woolie building his castle on lies and bullshit
[2:35:40] <thesickestzak> nliBOO nliBOO

[2:35:52] <+Dorf1> there is a randomizer romhack for this game @pectusumbra
[2:35:52] <ChloeFleurage> reggie just copying minh again
[2:35:56] <+Grayhammatter> DUCK
[2:35:56] <%MisterArcanine> Woolie would you like to buy this shovel? To help you keep digging
[2:35:58] <samuraijakanddaxter> magic stat only mattering for in battle magic usage means you actually have to catch the person on a yellow square first
[2:36:03] <+Grayhammatter> duck mage
[2:36:10] <%viewtifulr> minh is becomeing a big YABE
[2:36:11] <%Solidnick18> Magic duck
[2:36:13] <+pectusumbra> I wouldn't want a randomizer, just a smoothed out experience.
[2:36:13] <%djazo> you mean the boat level from silent hill 2 ?
[2:36:22] <%Livelinne> ooooh fancy
[2:36:30] <DaBigVitus> move it or lose it wools
[2:36:54] <%GalacticaPhanto> I feel ulterior motives in that tone
[2:36:58] <+Dimfish> woolie fucked him last session and is now gaslighting him to double down
[2:37:00] <C4m3r0n0409> What is Woolie doing
[2:37:02] <%kingkeldeo31> @samuraijakanddaxter It affects field magic damage too, least I thought it does
[2:37:03] <Klefth> Why is Woolie avoiding random battles?
[2:37:03] <DaBigVitus> he's really been getting fucked with the rolls
[2:37:03] <%Livelinne> capitalism,man...
[2:37:06] <%agumon9000> His bag is sealed
[2:37:17] <%jiggy_snipe> Woolie needs a weapon, he's so useless right now
[2:37:22] <dastmwolf> reggies fault for being naive
[2:37:24] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Klefth Doesn;t want Minh to get him
[2:37:25] <samuraijakanddaxter> maybe it affects the damage, but minh is so fast he always dodges
[2:37:33] <+paladinstarbuster> remember when Woolie stole your money reggie? dont forget that.
[2:37:44] <+MrAtheGreat> Oooo Minh a gangsta now?

[2:41:06] <+soFISHticated98> Minh is playing smart
[2:41:07] <NWannabe> The dullening
[2:41:08] <+DesertPenguin> Cashews are great, the perfect amount of natural salty flavor
[2:41:14] <Klefth> If someone gets spellsword, Minh is completely fucked
[2:41:16] <+bear_breaker20> dio is a nerd cause he ran away from his father like a bitch
[2:41:18] <+pectusumbra> robo=reggie has a nice ring to it
[2:41:18] <deadbeat34> Man, reading ahead in the manga has been quite revelatory.

[3:01:37] <+soFISHticated98> you have to go there though
[3:01:38] <%Th3SmartAlec> Reggie also needs a shit ton of other stuff to become hero that we won't be seeing
[3:01:38] <+Grayhammatter> if minh is doing what i think he's doing, reggie just needs to wait
[3:01:38] <+Dimfish> you invest in castles by landing on them
[3:01:42] <%jiggy_snipe> have to do it in person

[3:20:06] <%agumon9000> Acrobat is right
[3:20:08] <ChloeFleurage> thats why minh is getting acrobat
[3:20:10] <SixthSun2> a
[3:20:11] <yeildingthought> Woolie will figure it out LUL

[3:20:14] <+paladinstarbuster> Why is reggie a bufoon
[3:20:15] <%Th3SmartAlec> How much is Minh reading ahead
[3:20:15] <%C24U> There are good items up there as well
[3:20:21] <SixthSun2> Actually, 3 ones and 1 two
[3:20:21] <crimsonsaens> Acrobat is from Casino cave too
[3:20:22] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1252638347819986945
[3:20:31] <%nintega010> you can still just have the hero licenses
[3:20:33] <%Lancaster_H> Minh the Greenpilled grinding offscreen
[3:20:34] <DaBigVitus> minh sitting on knowledge
[3:20:36] <+pectusumbra> I think you can give the item in advance though
[3:20:36] <deadbeat34> oh, they're ALL in dungeons.
[3:20:39] <thesickestzak> SO I GRINDED OFFSCREEN A LITTLE-Minh probably
[3:20:41] <%Rekinsinn> castle in the sky is still full of incredible loot tho
[3:20:43] <+Dimfish> this was the shit people sent to minh, be mentioned it at the start of the strea.
[3:20:47] <+pectusumbra> alchemist
[3:20:47] <+Cyril_Ryerde> monk and alchemist
[3:20:47] <+Gespens> Alchemist
[3:20:48] <%Th3SmartAlec> @nintega010 And hold on to it for several hours?
[3:20:49] <crimsonsaens> Monk and Alchemist
[3:20:49] <%DukeBlack_> this is why you can't go into this blind
[3:20:51] <NWannabe> Minh is the pat of the channel?
[3:20:51] <Maleicus> alchemist
[3:20:52] <+craftyraichu> As Phil always says: "So you wanna be a hero, kid? Well woopdy do!"
[3:20:52] <Klefth> Monk and Alchemist
[3:20:57] <%Jetzord> Anything important happen in the last hour?
[3:20:59] <+Mekhet09> Reggie needed to stay on level one to grind the contract and get out without a problem.
[3:21:00] <%DashXero> Spin the wheel. See whom it may call. Give in to temptation...
[3:21:00] <EpitaphTransmits> Monk and Alchemist
[3:21:07] <yeildingthought> I forgot Kappa
[3:21:07] <C4m3r0n0409> You wouldve had it for the future
[3:21:09] <%nothuzad> Jetzord reggie got wiped by rico jr
[3:21:13] <%saltpiggu> I think you unlock it
[3:21:13] <%jiggy_snipe> can't be blind about everything, literally just waste time when we're playing for money
[3:21:13] <%nintega010> @Th3SmartAlec yeah, but if they wanted to
[3:21:14] <+pectusumbra> the item unlocks it
[3:21:27] <dastmwolf> so he was cryptic about the jobs and the requirements on porpuse
[3:21:28] <+Cyril_Ryerde> you can unlock it but you cant change into it
[3:21:28] <C4m3r0n0409> NO CASTLE
[3:21:33] <f4ntom98> Reg is still up there
[3:21:33] <Klefth> You bring it to the castle
[3:21:35] <%agumon9000> Yes
[3:21:35] <C4m3r0n0409> YES
[3:21:40] <Maleicus> no
[3:21:42] <%ChrisPlaysThing> yes to the castle

[3:21:50] <%MisterArcanine> Are all of Minh’s stock in towns?
[3:21:50] <%jiggy_snipe> yes you always do the reqs later
[3:21:53] <%Jetzord> @nothuzad It's hard being Reggie Gang sometimes
[3:21:55] <sosaltymboy> It would probably have been stolen from his corpse on the way honestly
[3:21:57] <thesickestzak> They all need a study session between the this and the next session at this point
[3:22:03] <%MisterArcanine> He only has one castle right ?
[3:22:05] <vierleger> Hackrobat
[3:22:13] <+Dorf1> mihn is gonna have the acrobat revive and the angel chocker 50% revive
[3:22:19] <%nintega010> woolie is on his queast to roboknight

[3:24:05] <%Rekinsinn> casino pays out often enough on average, but it's not guaramteed
[3:24:16] <+GimmMeUhSammich> On the 5,000 gold slots, getting a triple cherry or triple coin and then getting "Great" will guarantee the Show Ticket.

[3:54:11] <%viewtifulr> KIlling woolie woolieFUN
[3:54:12] <phatmac16> KILL WOOLIE
[3:54:17] <%DashXero> Why not do something productive and go after Minh...?
[3:54:17] <%JeoDood> His tears will hydrate him THIS IS YOUR HERO LOOSERS
[3:54:17] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Reggie, you need to go after Mihn
[3:54:25] <%emperordread> it's 30000% worth chasing woolie
[3:54:28] <+paladinstarbuster> get mihn
[3:54:28] <reonome> fuck up minh
[3:54:28] <%jiggy_snipe> just chill
[3:54:30] <C4m3r0n0409> Why would he go for woolie woolie has nothing
[3:54:33] <Klefth> Minh is bouncing between a store and the casino anyway. Reggie couldn't attack him even if he gets there
[3:54:40] <kulmoth> Minhcels and Team Snek laughing their asses off right now
[3:54:40] <%viewtifulr> I can see you reading this woolie
[3:54:41] <+Dimfish> at this point just go darkling twice
[3:54:42] <Maleicus> nothing but the objective
[3:54:44] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Klefth True
[3:54:44] <+GimmMeUhSammich> Woolie just doing the mission while Reggie does nothing
[3:54:46] <korth367> @WoolieVersus reg you should just spam the trap option, it would fuck with everyone at least
[3:54:46] <+craftyraichu> Maybe it's symbolic of Reggie's heroics that he's a lousy villian?
[3:54:47] <TheArrow_> @Hawkbone_ if he keeps it up, he might overtake woolie as the unluckiest darkling
[3:54:51] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Reggie can seal Mihns bag. He can totally attack him
[3:54:53] <+Mekhet09> Minh would be fucked if reggie closed the shop on him.
[3:54:54] <C4m3r0n0409> Woolie has nothing for him
[3:54:55] <%ekodrop> kill woolie to stop the mission from being completed
[3:54:56] <%JetpackMcQuack> Reggie's going home hungry
[3:54:58] <%Hawkbone_> @TheArrow_ He already has
[3:54:59] <%MisterArcanine> Going after Woolie will just make Minh permanently one the lead
[3:55:03] <%jiggy_snipe> interesting
[3:55:04] <DaBigVitus> at this point none of them deserve the win
[3:55:10] <sosaltymboy> call into the niiiiiiiight
