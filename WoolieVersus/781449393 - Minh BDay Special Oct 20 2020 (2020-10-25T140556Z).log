[0:31:40] <+notkojima> coins be exchanged for goods and services
[0:31:40] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:31:40] <Louie_Salmon> More coins = more garbage sent? That's what I thought anyway
[0:31:42] <waffleandman> gotta know where the stars are
[0:31:45] <SilverFaustX> the engine is not the same as OG smb, it feels floatier
[0:31:47] <$RunningNGunning> Money also determines rank at the end
[0:31:51] <+jetjagger222> SMB1 mario does resemble a palette swapped captain price, i can't unsee it
[0:31:54] <+TheOneCalledRock> naw, the stages are basically whats in the level pool when you go to the next level
[0:32:05] <+JeluxDaCasual> @Louie_Salmon Garbage is sent on kills, coins let you use item box
[0:32:05] <SilverFaustX> didnt die to first goomba
[0:32:13] <RamenRiderZ> Mario 35 Lost Levels when
[0:32:18] <+cvp5127> fireball is the meta
[0:32:32] <+RadDude6969> moon2CR
[0:32:37] <+notkojima> @ramenriderz 18 people a match lost to accidently bumping into poison mushrooms
[0:32:45] <Louie_Salmon> @jeluxdacasual Okay, I popped into a stream and saw people collecting like 1,000 coins, I guess that's just for score.
[0:33:20] <+JeluxDaCasual> the more coins you have, the more you can use the item box
[0:33:23] <+TheOneCalledRock> @RamenRiderZ naw, give me super mario bros 2 or 3 35. that's where the real fun begins
[0:33:29] <+JeluxDaCasual> It comes in handy in the late game
[0:33:33] <Zayasu> mario maker 2?
[0:33:33] <gustavozxd> i can feel the rust
[0:33:50] <gustavozxd> its crazy how you can see everyone's screen
[0:33:56] <Louie_Salmon> 20 coins, extra fire flowers are time
[0:34:04] <+JeluxDaCasual> gain time on kills, then when you have enough time (300 sec) you can focus on coins
[0:34:05] <+notkojima> woolie hit x

[0:34:44] <%Irridium> LUL
[0:34:46] <JetpackMcQuack> You go to 1-1 between each game, I think
[0:34:46] <%Solidnick18> turtle is human
[0:34:47] <+TheNotoriousJTS> haha shell goes brrrr
[0:34:51] <JetpackMcQuack> Each level
[0:34:54] <Lancaster_H> human is turtle
[0:35:02] <+JeluxDaCasual> you gain more time on combo kills and head stomps that fireballs
[0:35:09] <+notkojima> @jetpackmcquack i don't think so, I think new people just pick it/people don't get how it works
[0:35:14] <FlamerickMDQ> this is switch only right?
[0:35:19] <+JeluxDaCasual> switch only
[0:35:20] <%doomerskeletor13> Yea
[0:35:29] <+xerotwo> turtle house
[0:35:32] <FlamerickMDQ> like every nintendo stuff, yeah, silly question zoneShrug
[0:35:37] <GarbageNirvana> How much of the chat is going to be English Korone I wonder
[0:35:47] <+JeluxDaCasual> I think this is an event/prototype for a full game coming out later with Luigi and other characters
[0:35:49] <@Menitta> was about to ask if you could go backwards but no
[0:35:52] <JetpackMcQuack> Secrets woolieSPICE
[0:35:54] <@Solidus_113> amazing meatball!
[0:35:56] <+tigerfang86> Warpzone-less
[0:36:00] <+JeluxDaCasual> hence why THIS version is going away in March
[0:36:06] <gustavozxd> that's confusing af
[0:36:07] <+notkojima> it's a shuffled Playlist of everyone's stage pick
[0:36:07] <+DoomRedMage> THIS IS HELL
[0:36:07] <%Prevot> it's survival, woolie
[0:36:12] <@Menitta> I gotta get the GB Color port of Mario 1. You can go backwards in that game
[0:36:15] <SilverFaustX> get more coins
[0:36:15] <RamenRiderZ> Warpzone gives you control
[0:36:16] <gryffinp> I admit I don't get it either
[0:36:16] <+MayorRev> @WoolieVersus HAPPY BIRTHDAY!
[0:36:22] <%doomerskeletor13> Mario stuck in purgatory
[0:36:25] <Zayasu> its not a race? FeelsBadMan
[0:36:32] <Louie_Salmon> You get all the levels later
[0:36:34] <%Regigangster> Kinda real dumb
[0:36:35] <JetpackMcQuack> Yeah
[0:36:36] <+jiggy_snipe> oh I thought it was a race
[0:36:39] <%Irridium> oh nintendo
[0:36:40] <+notkojima> the design is fine, not explaining how it works clearly kills it
[0:36:41] <+cvp5127> thats too much value
[0:36:43] <FlamerickMDQ> At first glare i was thinking in "speedrun race" but i guess thats really bad idea
[0:36:50] <+MayorRev> oh is the goal survival over beating the level?
[0:36:52] <GarbageNirvana> Someone tell Woolie he still gets stuff for picking up items
[0:36:52] <+jiggy_snipe> so its survival mainly
[0:36:52] <%LastHazzerd> it's unfortunate early on, but when you have more levels it gets super overwhelming
[0:36:53] <%Solidnick18> fiyaballlll
[0:36:55] <gryffinp> ...So why would woolie ever die
[0:36:57] <%Regigangster> Seems like a quick and easy way to ruin the game for people
[0:36:59] <%SuperKirby24> the other mario royale was a race to the end of the world
[0:37:01] <%Prevot> race would be over in a second, instead of lasting until it becomes too hard to win
[0:37:02] <rsg220> there is no crueler tartarus for mario
[0:37:03] <JetpackMcQuack> On the other hand I'm really god damn good at 1-1
[0:37:05] <black_pariah> dont just run past items you need coins
[0:37:22] <%cobalt_phoenix_> SPIKY

[0:39:27] <%LastHazzerd> it's MARIO 35
[0:39:27] <Louie_Salmon> You have to be level 100 to be Luigi apparently
[0:39:28] <gustavozxd> boring
[0:39:34] <%LastHazzerd> not Mario BROS
[0:39:34] <+JeluxDaCasual> It's MARIO 35
[0:39:39] <+Parrish_broadnax> I thought you could be luigi
[0:39:40] <Darren716> You actually can be luigi
[0:39:44] <FazzleRazzle> you can unlock luigi at rank 100
[0:39:46] <JetpackMcQuack> lootboxes when
[0:39:47] <PKSomething> There's a cheat code to be luigi
[0:39:48] <Darren716> But you gotta be level 100
[0:39:54] <+HitchhikingThrough> I can't believe woolies playing the fortnites
[0:40:00] <gustavozxd> speedrunners would wipe everyone LUL
[0:40:06] <waffleandman> speedrunners would only win then LUL
[0:40:07] <%Regigangster> There's really no reason to keep it so limited.
[0:40:13] <PKSomething> oh you need to be lvl 100, dang
[0:40:16] <peanutdot007> Woah Naruto looks different in this game
[0:40:26] <gustavozxd> lv 100 for luigi cause he's the king
[0:40:43] <+MayorRev> oh my god this looks like chaos
[0:40:50] <RamenRiderZ> This with Mario 3 levels would be tight

[0:41:27] <+HitchhikingThrough> People are using the warpzones, aren't they?
[0:41:36] <$RunningNGunning> The main theory of how the levels work is that the level you select before the match is put into a pool of levels that are then sorted randomly.
[0:41:38] <@Menitta> You can use warpzones
[0:41:38] <+HitchhikingThrough> Yeah ok
[0:41:38] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @nmaten super bario mrothers?

[0:54:40] <@Menitta> damnit Kyle
[0:54:42] <DaKnightWarrior> for real
[0:54:42] <%rustedfish> I never understand mystery stains, and their spawn locations.
[0:54:43] <gustavozxd> Woolie didn't get it huh atpCap
[0:54:43] <+JeluxDaCasual> lol, my MOM used to punch holes in walls
[0:54:47] <%cobalt_phoenix_> it's always fuckin kyle
[0:54:48] <zamzoph> It's like the bathroom scene in the Eddie Murphy movie Daddy Day Care
[0:54:52] <@Solidus_113> you assume angry people think rationally
[0:54:53] <+xdeathknightx> Woolie has a thing with having small friends who cause weird stains ;)
[0:54:53] <%eriksdrums> "ARG! I won't have to pay for this!"
[0:54:53] <%CommanderSqueaks> @JeluxDaCasual WHAT!?
[0:54:54] <%Solidnick18> i will never do that
[0:54:57] <+JeluxDaCasual> yeeyeyeyeyye
[0:54:59] <+JeluxDaCasual> NO CAP
[0:55:01] <gryffinp> Better a wall than a face
[0:55:02] <%KoopaPrez> I dont think Woolie got it haha
[0:55:06] <jeosadn> Ooh Minh's here! Hi Minh!
[0:55:06] <@Menitta> to be fair breaking things is fun
[0:55:09] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @Zomner
[0:55:09] <Junkles> only time I ever threw something in anger was my DS when playing mario hoops 3v3
[0:55:10] <tearfuldevil> i don't get that, is the diea that white people have weaker walls?
[0:55:10] <Broand> it's the passion!
[0:55:15] <dinnydanny777> It's frustration though
[0:55:16] <$BallerSwagBro9k> YEET
[0:55:18] <Ner234> Anger isn't always rational
[0:55:23] <+Taglog7> Small Small turtle House
[0:55:24] <%emperordread> Heated Gamer Moment
[0:55:28] <+JeluxDaCasual> She told me in her youth she would punch holes in walls
[0:55:36] <+JeluxDaCasual> at her grandma's house
[0:55:39] <+Taglog7> I can't wait for the game to make that reference
[0:55:40] <@Solidus_113> I knew a kid who stomped on his 360 after a bad game of CoD. He had some real problems
[0:55:42] <+wicketpelican> Oh his father threw the coffee in the ceilling? Weird. Also, angry people hits whatever in their face, pretty whiteboish but I saw all kinds of people doing it in university (the place where they break you)
[0:55:47] <gustavozxd> I still have some anger problems but I'm not proud of it, in fact I hate it but ah well
[0:55:48] <Zezinizzle> i never broke a controller bc i was too poor and my brother would beat my ass if i did anyways
[0:56:03] <RamenRiderZ> Homer that's not God. That's just a waffle Bart tossed up there
[0:56:05] <%LastHazzerd> now it's only self-harm that i gotta worry about
[0:56:15] <gryffinp> Minh's dad probably owned his ceiling
[0:56:16] <+cvp5127> gamer rage
[0:56:19] <+jetjagger222> controllers are super expensive for a third world budget, never really got it
[0:56:23] <+JeluxDaCasual> I only ever threw a controller once, but I threw it into a pillow so I don't think that counts.
[0:56:24] <+wicketpelican> I never broke anything like controllers, cellphones, etc, but I punched a lot of people and sometimes things.
[0:56:28] <@Solidus_113> you're wrong Woolie
[0:56:30] <tearfuldevil> oh no, i broke my landlords propoerty, im so devestated
[0:56:31] <%Solidnick18> abit
[0:56:31] <dinnydanny777> Well some people get so upset that they aren't there
[0:56:47] <+JeluxDaCasual> Fucking Arkham Asylum
[0:56:48] <Zezinizzle> self awareness is the difference i think
[0:56:52] <%ChoculaUltra> happy birthday, minh!
[0:56:53] <DaKnightWarrior> yeah.
[0:56:54] <NeroInfinite> I sually just grab a pillow and yeah.
[0:56:59] <$BallerSwagBro9k> There have been cases of peolle literally having rage blackouts
[0:57:06] <tearfuldevil> i had anger issues as a kid but anger management therapy helped
[0:57:10] <GarbageNirvana> High anxiety doesn't help
[0:57:12] <RayCSmooth> There's a cell for people like that...
[0:57:18] <tearfuldevil> never quite got rage balckout bad, from my distant memory
[0:57:28] <+wicketpelican> I had anger issues and what saved me was punk rock concerts. Mosh pits are a blessing for anger.
[0:57:48] <%eriksdrums> I've broken something in rage ONCE. It was my own property and it happened at the apex of the most emotionally taxing shouting fight of my life. I've never broken a desk because somebody else chose Widowmaker
[0:57:50] <SilverFaustX> its called being delirious
[0:57:51] <Broand> The worst is where they try to justify themselves afterward as "I was angry!"
[0:57:52] <RamenRiderZ> Metal music mellows minds
[0:57:57] <FeltSn0wman> i think its a mix of anxiety and never being taught how to internalize feelings like that
[0:57:59] <gustavozxd> ah well atpFeelsBeardMan
[0:58:01] <%CommanderSqueaks> Getting hardwood floors definitely curtailed my throwing controller issue.
[0:58:05] <zamzoph> SourPls

[0:58:35] <Zezinizzle> it is absolutely fine to feel anger but not to redirect at others.
[0:58:35] <RamenRiderZ> Coke misuse
[0:58:43] <gryffinp> I think that was the saddest "we do it" I've ever heard from woolie
[0:58:46] <+cvp5127> it gained sentience

[0:59:17] <+Bailey__gaming> Aspartame is worse than suger
[0:59:19] <%LastHazzerd> i like Coke Zero because it's less sweet
[0:59:27] <SilverFaustX> no its not, sugar is evil
[0:59:27] <+jetjagger222> a van, that's not dodgy at all
[0:59:30] <%LastHazzerd> but i'd rather just not have cola
[0:59:31] <+wicketpelican> Crack is just Coke Zero. You lose weight and tastes like shit.

[1:02:29] <DrkJP520> @CommanderSqueaks I see
[1:03:04] <+Dr_DangerPhD> legions of hammer bros populating the screen when it gets super crazy

[1:06:21] <+JeluxDaCasual> someone ALWAYS dies
[1:06:35] <%ragingusername> ragingusername subscribed at Tier 1.
[1:06:36] <+Bailey__gaming> as someone who casusal speedruned Mario i keep trying to GO FAST which is bad idea on this
[1:06:52] <+ShinobiPhoenix> more coins for jumping death, especially chaining jumps

[1:09:10] <+ShinobiPhoenix> 4-2 or 4-4 (the first maze)
[1:09:19] <@Menitta> I wish there was more love for Mario 2

[1:09:49] <+ShinobiPhoenix> there;s plenty of love for Mario 2US, it jsut doesn't exists outside of playing the original game

[1:09:51] <+Bailey__gaming> if you know where a Star is always go for stars

[1:10:35] <+TheOneCalledRock> not a lot but it's there
[1:10:44] <@Menitta> I bet they were gonna do a theme for Mario 2 but just put a power up out
[1:11:10] <%eriksdrums> How does the game prevent people from camping near the end flag to wait out other players?
[1:11:17] <@Menitta> Mario 2 US fucks
[1:11:25] <+ShinobiPhoenix> @eric
[1:11:32] <+jiggy_snipe> I guess time would keep running?
[1:11:38] <%ragingusername> C-C-C-C-COMBO STOMP THEM!
[1:11:39] <+ShinobiPhoenix> @eriksdrums time acclerates like CRAZY if you stop moving
[1:11:48] <%FuqBoiSlim> wait why didn't woolie use the 1-2 shortcut does that not exist in this?
[1:11:53] <+TheOneCalledRock> i feel mario maker as a whole had a lot of potential that just wasted IMO
[1:12:02] <+JeluxDaCasual> While in the could, anything that gets sent your way is nullified
[1:12:10] <+Bailey__gaming> you do better if u kill more stuff so Stars are what you want
[1:12:13] <+JeluxDaCasual> *cloud
[1:12:14] <+TheOneCalledRock> like there could have been a LOT of neat stuff in those games that just wasn't full explored
[1:12:17] <@Menitta> it does but it just sends you to random levels. You dont really get the same benefits from the warpzones
[1:12:19] <%eriksdrums> @jiggy_snipe @ShinobiPhoenix Thanks guys
[1:12:24] <%Prevot> buzzy beetle I think
[1:12:50] <%ChoculaUltra> rip!
[1:12:51] <+ShinobiPhoenix> Buzzy Beetles are just obstacles
[1:12:51] <GarbageNirvana> You're still getting credit for just stomping on koopas
[1:12:51] <JetpackMcQuack> cyrHands
[1:12:55] <%Solidnick18> Jebaited
[1:12:56] <+Pequod1> Falls are the killer
[1:13:07] <+Bailey__gaming> last two goes for ever
[1:13:09] <+HitchhikingThrough> Yeah the balance seems really fucked
[1:13:10] <JetpackMcQuack> These games are marathons
[1:13:11] <%FuqBoiSlim> Nothing
[1:13:11] <MegaApple18> man
[1:13:17] <+MayorRev> gg
[1:13:20] <+HitchhikingThrough> final 2-3 really don't eliminate fast enough
[1:13:25] <+Pequod1> Absolutely worth 50 coins
[1:13:32] <+dil_drip> Woolie do the roar.
[1:13:38] <BlackIronPliskin> Fire flower doesn't build enough time when the clock speeds up
[1:13:42] <+ShinobiPhoenix> but yeah, if an enemy can be stomped easily, especially if they are in your way in anyway, you should stomp them instead of fireballs to get the time bonus. and always try to chain jump for big time bonus
[1:13:46] <%eriksdrums> @WoolieVersus Thanks for streaming, boys!
[1:13:50] <+MayorRev> I'd love to see tetris 99 if you guys are up for it
[1:13:54] <JetpackMcQuack> You can get some real asshole enemy placements but most enemies are free
[1:14:00] <+HitchhikingThrough> As long as you have a star/fireflower available, the amount of enemies is basically meaningless
[1:14:07] <@akuda_bar> spend that money
[1:14:16] <Triplicat> that's why there's special battle mode
[1:14:25] <Triplicat> no starting item allowed
[1:14:25] <%Prevot> sometimes the game places piranha plants in absolute fuck you places
[1:14:39] <+ShinobiPhoenix> @HitchhikingThrough but you should never spam fireballs unless you have a lot of time because that eats more of your time than you gain
[1:14:39] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1318434198781386755
[1:14:50] <+Bailey__gaming> 1 ups are green and give 20 coins
[1:14:53] <+ShinobiPhoenix> lot of enemies in the way I mean
[1:14:54] <+JeluxDaCasual> IT was a 1up
[1:15:00] <RamenRiderZ> BRRRR
[1:15:00] <%SuperKirby24> brrrrrr
[1:15:04] <StarMechV> that koopa was in endless agony
[1:15:04] <NotDamare> lmao
[1:15:21] <+HitchhikingThrough> infinite time unlocked
[1:15:22] <+ShinobiPhoenix> Woolie should have killed all those gusy
[1:15:33] <+ShinobiPhoenix> that was free time on the table
[1:15:43] <%CommanderSqueaks> @ShinobiPhoenix Look at who is holding the controller.
[1:15:44] <%Regigangster> Bowser time
[1:15:46] <JetpackMcQuack> I finally went and beat it last year
[1:15:48] <%Prevot> I did
[1:15:50] <+MayorRev> SourPls
[1:16:01] <+ShinobiPhoenix> @Regigangster oh, Ididn't notice it switched to Birthday Boy
[1:16:06] <FlamerickMDQ> Fak
[1:16:07] <JetpackMcQuack> monkaS
[1:16:11] <%Prevot> I love the kind of bullshit Lost Levels pulls on the player
[1:16:20] <Blank9> if lost levels came out as mario bros 2 outside of japan, people would have hated the series
[1:16:22] <DaKnightWarrior> I beat it but it was not worth it NotLikeThis
[1:16:27] <@Menitta> I do hope Nintendo puts out a NSMB collection at some point maybe in a next console
[1:16:30] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[1:16:37] <FlamerickMDQ> I should watch a warpless speedrun of mario 2 "lost lvls"
[1:16:38] <@Solidus_113> he's so dead
[1:16:44] <%SuperKirby24> ded
[1:16:49] <JetpackMcQuack> He was having goomba troubles
[1:17:00] <DrkJP520> He ate fire and choked
[1:17:01] <+MayorRev> gottem
[1:17:16] <Triplicat> game's been out for how long now? and people haven't advanced past looping world 1 meta to get to sending the real asshole enemies huh
[1:17:18] <%Prevot> @Blank9 nah, back then people would have just sucked up and played it. mario 3 would happen a few years later anyway
[1:17:18] <%SuperKirby24> that kinda thing with the star is super satisfying
[1:17:22] <Triplicat> like lakitus
[1:17:39] <+ShinobiPhoenix> I never seen anyone break up to the top of the roof here
[1:17:42] <+xerotwo> you had to beat it first to unlock
[1:17:47] <JetpackMcQuack> Just a race
[1:17:50] <FlamerickMDQ> so, the X button is "buy" a random box per 20 coins?
[1:17:55] <+HitchhikingThrough> When you spawn blocks for other people in tetris they're almost always a problem, when you spawn more enemies for another person in this game it basically gives them more time
[1:17:55] <@Menitta> It'd be sick if they add like Mario Lost Levels or Mario 3 stuff to thid
[1:17:58] <+ShinobiPhoenix> but I guess now I understand that keeps you from killing enemies for time

[1:19:05] <BreakersAweigh> BLOOPER IN THIS GAME ARE AWFUL
[1:19:06] <Triplicat> LUL
[1:19:06] <@Menitta> I really like the water levels in Mario 1

[1:19:20] <%r0chelimit> r0chelimit subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 6 month streak! Hey guys, its good to see y'all. I've been curious about Mario 35 and glad to see it looks fun
[1:19:20] <zamzoph> THEY FLY NOW
[1:19:20] <dots4eyes> Humbus
[1:19:20] <FlamerickMDQ> Trash Talk is for SFV
[1:19:21] <%FuqBoiSlim> THE STATE OF IT
[1:19:23] <devanmuse> water levels are sin
[1:19:24] <+Estuko> Thanks for the KPOPglow @r0chelimit
[1:19:31] <@Menitta> tHeY fLy NoW
[1:19:41] <%Mr_Strut> I like water levels, but mostly for the music
[1:19:44] <%Prevot> but the bloopers do fly
[1:19:47] <+ShinobiPhoenix> you usually have to do a one-gap run over a pit to make speed and then just over two large pits with a one block in between
[1:19:49] <zamzoph> bloopers
[1:19:56] <devanmuse> without a fire flower you can't kill anything to regain time. water levels are a time sink
[1:19:57] <MasterTonberry23> all right its my favorite grenadan canadian
[1:20:04] <@Menitta> Water levels in Mario 1 feel faster than other Mario games for some reason
[1:20:13] <+ShinobiPhoenix> Bloopers are a PROBLEM, THEY FLY NOW (they fly now?), they fly now
[1:20:23] <+Caboose2492> minh kinda killing it rn
[1:20:26] <@Menitta> the worst are autoscroll underwater levels
[1:21:00] <+ShinobiPhoenix> so much fireball spamming, so much time eaten
[1:21:01] <FlamerickMDQ> whats with the 2 grey blocks?
[1:21:03] <@Menitta> I'm surprised you cant move backwards
[1:21:08] <FlamerickMDQ> on the other players maps i mean
[1:21:16] <+ShinobiPhoenix> @FlamerickMDQ they only got 33 people
[1:21:26] <FlamerickMDQ> oh "didnt found player" gotcha
[1:21:35] <%Solidnick18> ooh
[1:21:47] <gordieda20> So the Army of Hammer bros block the screen LUL
[1:21:47] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:21:50] <@Solidus_113> watch where the sprites go on kill @WoolieVersus
[1:21:54] <Triplicat> oh YEAH
[1:21:55] <Triplicat> hammer bros
[1:21:56] <+Bailey__gaming> eventually everyone gets a bowser stage and then u can end up with 6 bowers on your screen
[1:22:07] <Triplicat> hammer bros and lakitus
[1:22:15] <DrkJP520> What if you just sit and wait with 400 on the clock?
[1:22:15] <%FuqBoiSlim> hammer bros are the first zoners
[1:22:25] <@Menitta> the OG Zoners
[1:22:27] <%Mr_Strut> Seems like all enemies get sent
[1:22:31] <+ShinobiPhoenix> I litearlly haven't even played this game yet (my Switch was in repair for over a month, and I just got it back), so I've been doing nothing but studying and watching videos
[1:22:36] <Louie_Salmon> It's exactly Tetris garbage
[1:22:47] <FlamerickMDQ> hey, respect tetris
[1:22:53] <+HitchhikingThrough> lol
[1:22:57] <%SuperKirby24> so the mario enemies just suffer eternal death feelsbadman
[1:22:57] <+JeluxDaCasual> Woolie's QA brain at work
[1:23:08] <Louie_Salmon> No I mean the "garbage" in Tetris LUL
[1:23:11] <@Menitta> No like the grey blocks in Tetris vs is called "garbage"
[1:23:18] <+HitchhikingThrough> Free items
[1:23:24] <+HitchhikingThrough> I mean, not free
[1:23:24] <+ShinobiPhoenix> farming for coins for items when the ENEMY SWARM COMES
[1:23:27] <+HitchhikingThrough> but reliable items
[1:23:30] <%Solidnick18> oh shit
[1:23:33] <gordieda20> Coins Can save your life late game
[1:23:34] <+ShinobiPhoenix> 4-4 the maze
[1:23:47] <redrins> no confidence
[1:23:54] <JetpackMcQuack> Cool
[1:24:01] <GarbageNirvana> I imagine that one runs the clock down on a lotta folks at first
[1:24:07] <JetpackMcQuack> It blacks out the timeline
[1:24:09] <+ShinobiPhoenix> people forgot how complicated Super Mario Bros 1 actually is
[1:24:15] <FlamerickMDQ> almost 400 time, that's a lot
[1:24:25] <superblar> When the enemies time is low their square will flash red
[1:24:28] <BlackIronPliskin> Their screen turns red when they're low on time
[1:24:37] <JetpackMcQuack> People just don't die in this game
[1:24:38] <MasterTonberry23> minhs playing, not woolz, yeah?

[1:25:04] <@akuda_bar> @black_pariah that will never happen Kappa
[1:25:06] <+ShinobiPhoenix> you might want to start killing enemies ot send at people
[1:25:08] <FlamerickMDQ> mario verse is br
[1:25:21] <%Terrarp> Beating bowser means someone just gets a random Bowser on their game?
[1:25:31] <black_pariah> i dont mean to talk shit i really didnt see the controller
[1:25:31] <ggbhtg> The noise was added in All Stars and DX
[1:25:33] <+Mooseman_> the coins on player's screen is how many roulette spins they have stocked up.
[1:25:35] <%Prevot> the All-Stars versions had the noise, I'm pretty sure
[1:25:47] <+ShinobiPhoenix> Lost Levels is a nightmare, straight up
[1:25:50] <MasterTonberry23> @Prevot it did yeah
[1:25:50] <JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[1:26:08] <%Prevot> oh yeah the warp that takes you back is grade A trolling
[1:26:08] <Novillion> I had the same problem in 8-4 of Lost levels! LUL

[1:26:53] <+ShinobiPhoenix> the wind and TRIANGLE JUMPSS in a MARIO game
[1:26:57] <%Prevot> maybe millenials would be tougher if they had to play Lost Levels as kids
[1:26:59] <GarbageNirvana> If kids got Lost Levels when it was new we wouldn't have COVID now
[1:27:00] <%Prevot> LUL
[1:27:04] <RamenRiderZ> What if it hard-boiled the Nintendo generations and made Dark Souls harder?

[1:29:53] <+ShinobiPhoenix> beating Ninja Gaiden legit is asking for gray matter to die from the heat your brain feels through sheer rage
[1:29:54] <@Menitta> To be fair though, kids still play a ton of one singular game because they dont buy every game that comes out lol
[1:29:59] <%Terrarp> Battle Network has fighting game like scene with weekly tournaments in Mexico

[1:30:45] <+xerotwo> RED TIMER
[1:30:47] <DaKnightWarrior> good run
[1:30:48] <YakumoYomi> Top 3
[1:30:48] <+ShinobiPhoenix> should have grabbed the mush
[1:30:49] <JetpackMcQuack> SeemsGood
[1:30:54] <ggbhtg> PI is exactly THREE
[1:30:55] <whimsicallifestyle> nice!
[1:30:56] <%Solidnick18> top 3 pretty good
[1:30:56] <%Mr_Strut> Bronze medal
[1:31:05] <+JeluxDaCasual> the mush would not help, mush is coins not time
[1:31:06] <Louie_Salmon> You definitely needed some more aggro
[1:31:08] <%CommanderSqueaks> Gotta go fast.
[1:31:11] <RamenRiderZ> Run fast, Kill fast
[1:31:13] <BlackIronPliskin> Jumps build more time, even with default enemies
[1:31:13] <ReaperOf1st> My nephews are killers at KI and I've had years of practice
[1:31:22] <%NeonBleu> Mario the Hedgehog
[1:31:24] <+ShinobiPhoenix> how are the other gusy still going
[1:31:26] <Spirit_NB> Burning coins can get you more time IIRC
[1:31:28] <ggbhtg> Gotta burn some coins to get Stars, probably
[1:31:34] <MasterTonberry23> im guessing woolz isnt doing the doom dlc yet?
[1:31:34] <Mysidian_Maestro> Kids can still do it, YouTube's flooded with Roblox speedruns.
[1:31:44] <BackwardCap> You messed up going to 1-4 at the end which had no enemies.
[1:31:48] <%Terrarp> @regigangster it is super crazy, a bunch of killers
[1:31:52] <ggbhtg> @MasterTonberry23 Is it Mario DLC?? Kappa
[1:31:56] <ggbhtg> if not, bad timing
[1:31:58] <BlackIronPliskin> Gotta spend those coins to get re[eat fire flowers to farm time
[1:32:04] <JetpackMcQuack> Against some guy that plays Mario Maker 80 hours a week
[1:32:06] <tearfuldevil> @HitchhikingThrough it does though? you have a health, which is as classic as difficulty gets, you have a hunger meter
[1:32:15] <%mr_miyagucci> my brother isnt super young but he is younger than me and played less of those retro games and he does shit in streets of rage 4 thats actually wild
[1:32:20] <%CommanderSqueaks> @JetpackMcQuack You mean Grandpoobear?
[1:32:21] <Lagseene> That song is sooo Nintendo Land
[1:32:22] <ggbhtg> One man's trash is another man's....garbage
[1:32:33] <MasterTonberry23> nuuu dont fail me now internet
[1:32:37] <+ShinobiPhoenix> people playing a lot of Mario Maker aren't actually using the same skills as this game

[1:32:53] <%Prevot> welp
[1:33:00] <+jiggy_snipe> vod time
[1:33:01] <%KoopaPrez> Just fo it again
[1:33:03] <@Solidus_113> backupssssssssss
[1:33:09] <+HitchhikingThrough> @tearfuldevil I mean yeah, but in minecraft you have the choice between infinite lives and one life. One is way easier than traditional games (to the point where death is almost meaningless), and one is way harder
[1:33:09] <%Solidnick18> well alright
[1:33:11] <%brickwall35> wait what happened?
[1:33:14] <SomersaultJustice> lol, my birthday was yesterday, so this is weird
[1:33:19] <CappuccinoGuil> wait, whose birthday?
[1:33:20] <DrJamesWoods> Happy Birthday, Minh!!
[1:33:35] <CappuccinoGuil> Oh shit, Happy Birthday, Minh! :D
[1:33:43] <+ShinobiPhoenix> this game expects you to navigate taking your time when necessary, killing enemies the right way at the right times, item management
[1:33:52] <%Prevot> that's like asking for Tetris 99 to be level based instead of survival
[1:33:59] <%r0chelimit> Oh and happy birthday Minh@
[1:34:12] <tearfuldevil> @HitchhikingThrough fair enough
[1:34:13] <%Kain5707> FeelsBirthdayMan
[1:34:17] <JetpackMcQuack> I think it's the same, unless people warp
[1:34:26] <Louie_Salmon> It's a very weird, non-standard system
[1:34:31] <@Solidus_113> The warp zones seem pretty random
[1:34:41] <@Solidus_113> you got 5-3 at one point
[1:34:48] <tearfuldevil> @HitchhikingThrough i just know the times I've fiddled with minecraft i've starved and died a bunch, cause i have no idea what I'm doing
[1:35:03] <+ShinobiPhoenix> I saw a warp zone that had almost 1-1, 1-3 and 1-1 again

[2:21:25] <OldManDeckardCain> he's too busy getting that duck for minh
[2:21:37] <@akuda_bar> @ShinobiPhoenix covid regulations mean you can't have more than one guest in a home in montreal
[2:21:39] <+xdeathknightx> Reggie still angry over Dokapon
[2:21:41] <+MrProw> You haven't lived until you played Mario Kart 8 with 4 people locally on tabletop mode
[2:21:53] <%ChoculaUltra> Minh said no Reggies allowed. Dokage rules Kappa

[2:22:05] <+Pequod1> I am the man who arranges the blocks...
[2:22:08] <Ner234> "Just start murdering", Woolie, 2020
[2:22:11] <%FuqBoiSlim> is that why the Tsushima streets started to only have reggie?
[2:22:16] <%FuqBoiSlim> *streams
[2:22:18] <@akuda_bar> yep
[2:22:35] <Darren716> Wait Montrael is that anal about their regs?
[2:22:50] <+ShinobiPhoenix> @akuda_bar yeah... America is quite a different place from that right now... pretty sure the chaos would be 50% worse if some governor tried to impose that here
[2:23:23] <BurdRightsActivist> woolquotes
[2:23:35] <+ShinobiPhoenix> "you can't tell me what to do in my own home, ARG, government too big and is evil"
[2:23:44] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @burdrightsactivist LUL
[2:23:48] <@Menitta> I love using joycon D pad with tetris
[2:24:02] <+ShinobiPhoenix> blame the Wii
[2:24:09] <@akuda_bar> @ShinobiPhoenix yeah i couldn't say who is right there. it seems like if you have people going to church in person then having two guests is trivial. but idk
[2:24:10] <DatAsuna> I love gamecube face buttons
[2:24:12] <BurdRightsActivist> "Unmatched with controllers" Okay, what about the N64? LUL
[2:24:12] <%SuperKirby24> nintendium in the controllers ran out I guess
[2:24:14] <%SirGO0SE> excuse me? have you seen the wii u? kappa
[2:24:15] <Cynical_Canadian> Ain't what they used to be, ain't what they used to be
[2:24:16] <Prevot> the wii u pro controller was perfect
[2:24:17] <DatAsuna> Gamecube everything else not so much
[2:24:17] <glass_marcus> GC Dpad was the beginning of the end
[2:24:19] <%Solidnick18> idk
[2:24:24] <+jiggy_snipe> cuz Nintendo likes to change stuff
[2:24:28] <+Lord0Mugen> @WoolieVersus Its because everyone in Nintendo that was good are either too old or DEAD.
[2:24:29] <+jiggy_snipe> INNOVATION
[2:24:32] <+ShinobiPhoenix> Switch Pro is amazing
[2:24:34] <DrkJP520> Not to mention the bullshit joy con drift problem
[2:24:44] <justinjones1989> The ps4 controller works fine until you play Tetris Effect.
[2:24:46] <%FuqBoiSlim> I thought the 3ds d pad as nice woolieDATTEBAYO
[2:24:51] <Darren716> The dpad on the switch pro controller never gave me problems
[2:24:53] <Cynical_Canadian> The N64 stick was a killer in Mario Party 1
[2:25:02] <DatAsuna> Except the PS1 sticks were fine
[2:25:06] <black_pariah> was it?
[2:25:08] <+Lord0Mugen> Gunpei Yokoi was the first to get the boot and he DIED in a car accident
[2:25:15] <+ShinobiPhoenix> my N64 sticks never had a problem, but I also neverplayed Mario Party 1
[2:25:16] <SlangPunk> 8bitdo do fantastic d-pads for anyone who wants to scratch that itch
[2:25:17] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:25:17] <black_pariah> didnt the saturn have one
[2:25:28] <Ner234> I love the final 10 theme
[2:25:29] <DedlokPM> Remember N64's Analog Stick Dust. rooVV
[2:25:30] <+MrProw> Pro Controller is almost perfect, it's really comfy in hand, has a great battery life. I just wish it had a better d-pad and analog triggers :(
[2:25:33] <+Lord0Mugen> Shiggy lost the fucking script at around the time he got Nintendo to make Wii Music
[2:25:35] <j3sharp> SourPls
[2:25:44] <+Lord0Mugen> And Iwata is.....dead.
[2:25:46] <+ShinobiPhoenix> but lots of Goldeneye and Perfect Dark and Smash
[2:26:01] <Vicnado_> Playstation Vita most underrated d pad of all time
[2:26:01] <Cynical_Canadian> Top 5
[2:26:24] <@Solidus_113> the D-Pad disk is still bad
[2:26:24] <+ShinobiPhoenix> Vita D-Pad is way too close to the analog pads
[2:26:25] <+Lord0Mugen> @Vicnado_ good DPAD and Analog sticks. bad EVERYTHING ELSE
[2:26:29] <+MrProw> the d-pad on the 3DS was alright
[2:26:34] <+Exicuren> Nintendo started to go very cheap on the manufacturing, the DS dpad was the last truly good nintendo dpad
[2:26:37] <JetpackMcQuack> gameattackNani
[2:26:42] <stanlychicken> xbox also improved their horrid d-pad
[2:26:45] <CollinCoyKoi> The DualShock 4 has super good sticks, too. Like, perfectly spaced apart and grooved so your fingers don't slip.
[2:26:52] <%mr_miyagucci> what did playstation do to their triggers, is it a ps5 or 4 thing?
[2:26:54] <waffleandman> mario kart ds ruined my dpad
[2:26:59] <Cynical_Canadian> Stack me more dawg
[2:26:59] <Carlioo> settle down virgil
[2:27:07] <DedlokPM> @black_pariah googled it, no. It only had the d-pad and 6 buttons
[2:27:09] <BlackermanZX> Snake hurt me more dawg doodNuts
[2:27:11] <Applecannon63> I hope Switch pro gives some better controllers
[2:27:13] <sonofthedeepsouth> WIN
[2:27:16] <Cynical_Canadian> This may be fun...
[2:27:18] <%FuqBoiSlim> might be blasphemous to say but the circle pad mini on the right side of the new 3DS/2DS are kinda based. Made my monster hunter 4 hunts much easier
[2:27:19] <Vicnado_> feel likes it's really easy to slide my finger back and forth on the Vita D pad, but yeah its close as hell to the analog stick
[2:27:20] <sonofthedeepsouth> WIN GODDAMIT
[2:27:21] <velgaduere> BOTCHAMANIA

[2:29:12] <%Prevot> today, woolie decides to go swimming with sharks
[2:29:13] <+ShinobiPhoenix> buy
[2:29:21] <velgaduere> this song is so damn good
[2:29:21] <+Lord0Mugen> NO ONE can tell me different
[2:29:21] <black_pariah> ah, the 3d saturn pad was after the n64
[2:29:46] <Vicnado_> them horns tho
[2:29:59] <+ShinobiPhoenix> anyone here old enough to have touch the Jaguar controller?
[2:29:59] <+MrProw> Steam Controller is absolutely amazing in third person shooters if you set it up right.
[2:30:07] <sonofthedeepsouth> ATTACK
[2:30:08] <Louie_Salmon> But you gotta get badges
[2:30:14] <MBDiana1> just borrow or buy a used xbox controller, way easier
[2:30:29] <sonofthedeepsouth> The best defense is a good offense
[2:30:40] <+Lord0Mugen> I cant play FPS games the same way without a Steam Controller
[2:30:45] <+MrProw> Played through Control with it while chilling on the couch, the precision both gyro and the touchpads gave me really made for an enjoyable experience
[2:30:59] <+ShinobiPhoenix> @sonofthedeepsouth unless you're playing a burn deck
[2:31:13] <velgaduere> become as Jaejae
[2:31:21] <+Lord0Mugen> That touchpad makes FPS and TPS games so fucking playable
[2:31:43] <+MrProw> Yes
[2:31:50] <+MrProw> It's a shame it's so underrated
[2:31:58] <arkv01> does tetris have rollback?
[2:31:59] <waffleandman> @Lord0Mugen more controllers need those extra back buttons
[2:32:04] <framewindowcleaner> Kirby background is fire
[2:32:22] <+Lord0Mugen> @waffleandman they do now for a couple of them
[2:32:22] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:32:29] <+MrProw> I think gyro + touchpads should be totally THE future for some of the games.
[2:32:29] <Ner234> SourPls
[2:32:31] <velgaduere> not for those crazy good aggro motherfuckers tho, they only drop FASTER

[2:32:55] <BlackermanZX> SourPls
[2:33:01] <ilpeggiore_> what song is this?
[2:33:09] <+Lord0Mugen> @MrProw maybe for the right stick functions. the Steam controller was AWFUL for 2D games
[2:33:17] <+ShinobiPhoenix> did anyone else buy the HoriPad Split Pro Joycons? they have more buttons on the back of the controller and turbo control on the front
[2:33:30] <%mr_miyagucci> I think this song is from triple deluxe but idk for sure
[2:33:37] <%mr_miyagucci> I didnt play that one
[2:33:42] <+MrProw> yeah, which is why i said for some of the games. ideally i'd love to see a controller where you can swap between analog sticks and touchpads
[2:33:43] <%Solidnick18> come on woolie
[2:33:46] <sonofthedeepsouth> Objective:Survive
[2:33:52] <%Solidnick18> get your head in he game
[2:33:55] <%cobalt_phoenix_> monkaS
[2:33:55] <MyNameIsRasus> monkaS
[2:34:01] <+ShinobiPhoenix> HoriPad Split Pro has entirely replaced my Joycons for handheld mode if I can help it
[2:34:05] <sonofthedeepsouth> Someone give woolie somebwater so he doesnt choke
[2:34:08] <%Solidnick18> teasssse it
[2:34:11] <+Taglog7> NO COACHING
[2:34:11] <MBDiana1> tetris 99 is extremely aggresive if youre a twitch streamer or a YTer
[2:34:21] <+MrProw> the back buttons should totally be in every controller though.
[2:34:21] <Ner234> Tetris 99 is just " monkaS : The Game "
[2:34:43] <%ChoculaUltra> I'm on the edge of my seat rn
[2:34:47] <+ShinobiPhoenix> the only time back stuff was a bad idea on controllers (so far) is the Vita, straight up

[2:35:27] <TheAmazingClaytor> SourPls
[2:35:28] <+Lord0Mugen> @WoolieVersus Are you this much of a badass in Tetris Attack/Panel de Pon and Magical Drop?
[2:35:30] <Vicnado_> too many tetris chads
[2:35:48] <%ChoculaUltra> I know so many non-gamers that are just cold blooded killers in tetris and it always blows my mind
[2:35:58] <+Lord0Mugen> Also favorite competitive puzzle game is Pieces on SNES
[2:36:09] <+ShinobiPhoenix> here's my question... who actually OWNS Meteos and why haven't they re-released or make a new one for consoles?
[2:36:20] <+MrProw> there are people who only play tetris and never played another videogame afterwards
[2:36:24] <+MrProw> like my mum
[2:36:31] <Frogwash> Min is 20??
