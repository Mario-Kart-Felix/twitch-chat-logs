[0:05:37] <%perfectsalami> perfectsalami subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 15 months! I got into guilty gear strive both because of your lore videos and the fact that it has 2 black characters in it with legitimately good designs and im always happy to see that. Thanks Woolie. Also smell of the game is incredible, nonsense lyrics and all
[0:05:43] <%bread_assassin> So, I see that the stream game is NOT Returnal.
[0:06:16] <Johannen> New Hot Release
[0:06:21] <Johannen> Just came out
[0:06:27] <Wahrow> @Johannen Yeah, he said yesterday that he wanted Minh to be playing with them so he changed the day, I think they're still playing Returnal after Samurai Gunn

[1:09:10] <bluphoenixxv> how many players can you have in a game
[1:09:19] <%dds333a> 4
[1:09:20] <SamuraiGunn2> Ana's dash gives you a jetpack

[1:09:29] <Saltmeisterr> hayao is FAST
[1:09:34] <Equirah> @Saltmeisterr does minit man die if no one kills him in 1 minute? LUL

[1:09:48] <@Menitta> lmaoooo that's sick
[1:09:54] <Equirah> YOOOOOO LUL
[1:10:10] <Saltmeisterr> Minh is Otomo
[1:10:11] <Saltmeisterr> uh
[1:10:12] <StreamingInVain> @SamuraiGunn2 I believe Woolz is Hayao, and Minh is Otomo
[1:10:13] <Equirah> everyone go buy this game LUL
[1:10:22] <YellowAfterlife> you may also juggle your leftover swords as Minit
[1:10:25] <%livlinn> Hayao means Fast Boi woolieYE
[1:10:26] <bluphoenixxv> Hayao do
[1:10:26] <Saltmeisterr> and regg is ghost
[1:10:26] <SamuraiGunn2> thx!
[1:10:33] <%dds333a> That battle
[1:10:33] <Prevot> nice
[1:10:44] <SamuraiGunn2> best review so far: "dog go fast"
[1:10:50] <Man_in_the_Red> not quite Buddy from Lisa the joyful but i'll take it
[1:10:54] <%xeromage> it IS ridiculous... because you all have guns and don't have to go into the death pit
[1:11:02] <Saltmeisterr> so the invis actually has decent counterplay
[1:11:14] <Saltmeisterr> cuz all light sources reveal it
[1:11:15] <%dds333a> Minh with the firewalls
[1:11:25] <Saltmeisterr> even from bullets
[1:11:38] <bluphoenixxv> neat
[1:11:51] <Saltmeisterr> also ghost has a floaty jump
[1:12:04] <r0dneyjenkins> yo this stage reminds me of Cave Story
[1:12:22] <MihajloMBlood> Oh the right camera is amazing
[1:12:29] <SamuraiGunn2> @r0dneyjenkins that's some strong praise
[1:12:29] <%dds333a> @r0dneyjenkins real talk. the colors, even a bit of the rock texture
[1:12:47] <Saltmeisterr> actually are the lighting effects off?
[1:12:59] <r0dneyjenkins> @SamuraiGunn2 you deserve it
[1:13:05] <SamuraiGunn2> oh man
[1:13:11] <SamuraiGunn2> this might be an old build
[1:13:15] <SamuraiGunn2> oh nvm
[1:13:16] <r0dneyjenkins> @dds333a exactly what I was thinking
[1:13:19] <SamuraiGunn2> there's the God Rays
[1:13:22] <Saltmeisterr> no there they are
[1:13:29] <Saltmeisterr> THE RAYS
[1:13:49] <%teefpal> what is this game?
[1:13:52] <%xeromage> only Minh has learned how to shoot down
[1:13:55] <%dds333a> the flame bullets affect the lighting inside the head too, good shit
[1:14:13] <lc_cl7> is there a "Final Destination" map ?
[1:14:13] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:14:18] <lc_cl7> if you know what i mean

[1:15:03] <r0dneyjenkins> !MOTIVATED
[1:15:04] <DontChuckle98> Seeing half of Minh’s face close to the camera’s making me crack up more than I should. Lol
[1:15:07] <%dds333a> Decisive
[1:15:12] <+silentnarga> Hayao can run up walls
[1:15:13] <Saltmeisterr> check the manual
[1:15:19] <%teefpal> @DontChuckle98 its great
[1:15:48] <lc_cl7> Minh literally in reggies head
[1:15:50] <%ja07sj> they write it on the side of the cabinet
[1:16:03] <%xeromage> invisible BULLETS!?
[1:16:08] <Saltmeisterr> Otomo also has a speed boost
[1:16:09] <%dds333a> @lc_cl7 taking up his space, eating his food
[1:16:27] <Saltmeisterr> after respawn or beheading an opponent
[1:16:35] <bluphoenixxv> this map is awesome
[1:16:55] <%dds333a> LUL
[1:17:21] <%dds333a> Yo, that invisibility SeemsGood
[1:18:03] <bluphoenixxv> I have even notice ghost going invisible which I guess is the point
[1:18:23] <Saltmeisterr> banger remix on this stage
[1:18:31] <Saltmeisterr> catJAM
[1:18:31] <Man_in_the_Red> so uh Dev, you wanna speak with devolver about one Zero
[1:18:59] <dmtjinni> Is this the first time the entire gang Woolz, Regge and Minh appear together on stream since covie started?
[1:19:04] <Man_in_the_Red> or would that have too much overlap as a crossover
[1:19:06] <lc_cl7> Minh is so good
[1:19:07] <Saltmeisterr> @Man_in_the_Red oh the devs are very much aware of people' requests for zero
[1:19:23] <SamuraiGunn2> it might be request #1
[1:19:25] <SamuraiGunn2> haha
[1:19:31] <SamuraiGunn2> we want lots of friends characters
[1:19:32] <lc_cl7> GO TEAM MINH
[1:19:48] <DSD24> I'm going GHOST
[1:20:01] <r0dneyjenkins> Yo Zero would be awesome for this
[1:20:04] <NotHereToStream> long active frames
[1:20:06] <%diegobandzz> Lol wait like minit, minit
[1:20:19] <SamuraiGunn2> I want Zero from MegaMan

[1:20:54] <bluphoenixxv> alright good people ima head out
[1:20:56] <Man_in_the_Red> i'll hazard a guess and say capcom wouldnt answer the phone on that one
[1:20:57] <%dds333a> @samuraigunn2 X or Z? Kappa
[1:21:20] <SamuraiGunn2> x is classic but z is anime
[1:21:20] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1417355334386061312?s=19
[1:21:22] <SamuraiGunn2> i can't decide
[1:21:36] <dmtjinni> just pressing buttons at random LUL
[1:21:44] <stanlychicken> zx is the answer
[1:21:49] <Man_in_the_Red> just to spare the animators making his green nips on every animation go Inti Creates
[1:21:58] <lc_cl7> omg minit gimmick is fucking awesome
[1:22:01] <Jathspuh> PogChamp
[1:22:06] <SamuraiGunn2> @Man_in_the_Red lol
[1:22:08] <iacus_> Minit should die after 60 secs no?
[1:22:09] <r0dneyjenkins> @SamuraiGunn2 Zero from Rockman you mean. Also Zero should have Sky Waltz
[1:22:19] <SamuraiGunn2> watch out for slug on showdowns
[1:22:23] <Saltmeisterr> @WoolieVersus Reggie u NEED read up on Slug's movelist. he has many tools.
[1:22:23] <SamuraiGunn2> he's a rule breaker
[1:22:25] <SamuraiGunn2> haha
[1:22:27] <YellowAfterlife> Minit does die after 60s but you don't usually last 60s
[1:22:29] <SamuraiGunn2> only slug brings his
[1:22:32] <%dds333a> LUL
[1:22:35] <das_sensentier> Yo I forgot this game existed
[1:22:40] <Man_in_the_Red> no, no, Zero from borderlands
[1:22:41] <iacus_> Oh that's awesome
[1:22:59] <+TheEvilOmega> Hey, Woolie, have you considered doing an LP of Skies of Arcadia: Legends, the third best RPG on the GameCube? I think it will tick all the Woolie will like this boxes.
[1:23:10] <Man_in_the_Red> or drakengard 3
[1:23:13] <SamuraiGunn2> other people can pick up Slug's kunais to get more ammo too
[1:23:29] <lc_cl7> haha this is a good idea for a stage
[1:23:42] <Saltmeisterr> Slug also has a fastfall, wall and ceiling cling, angled bullets, and angled reflects
[1:23:52] <r0dneyjenkins> bullet tennis
[1:24:10] <Saltmeisterr> MINH RIGHT

[1:26:43] <SamuraiGunn2> minit
[1:26:44] <Spirit_9B> I'm gonna stick my sword out, and if you get hit, it's your fault!
[1:26:49] <SamuraiGunn2> minit's attack just stays out long
[1:26:54] <%teefpal> Wait i thought this was a samuari game, what's minit doing here?
[1:26:57] <Saltmeisterr> MINH WRONG
[1:27:00] <Saltmeisterr> AGAIN
[1:27:14] <SamuraiGunn2> no ammo on showdown except for slug

[1:46:50] <%dds333a> That was neato
[1:47:00] <+fetrigon> @iacus_ that's good but you still have to focus on finding your character during combat.
[1:47:07] <@Menitta> lmaooo
[1:47:13] <Saltmeisterr> @WoolieVersus do u guys wanna know where the other weapon shrine is?
[1:47:16] <Solidnick18> yeahhhhh

[1:47:26] <%dds333a> unless Kappa
[1:47:41] <%X2Eliah> LUL
[1:47:42] <Solidnick18> this was as intended Kappa
[1:47:46] <iacus_> ideally you're able to follow your char when you know where it is. plus you get a spotlight when someone dies

[2:13:12] <glass_marcus> ayyy
[2:13:13] <%illtima> Check out ODDTAXI
[2:13:14] <%hax_metatron> Maybe Reggie can watch HxH and talk to us about it
[2:13:15] <%dds333a> The Warriors
[2:13:21] <%dds333a> back up back up
[2:13:25] <+mechslayer71> has Reggie watched Avatar?
[2:13:38] <Dopamien> hells kitchen PogChamp
[2:13:42] <%dds333a> The Warriors is a goddamn masterpiece, and it bears little mentioning
[2:13:48] <%Lion_kun> Reading the haikyuu manga
[2:14:08] <%dds333a> Thunderball Kappa
[2:14:09] <%Juriasu> most of the golden eye nostalgia comes from the game I think
[2:14:14] <PanicSwytch> Dr. No is my favorite Bond film
[2:14:27] <@Menitta> I'm a big fan of Casino Royale
[2:14:29] <iacus_> Yes
[2:14:36] <%dds333a> Oh, yesssss
[2:14:37] <%Lion_kun> The Daniel Craig one or the Niven one?
[2:14:40] <masterfire23> I love that sequence
[2:14:57] <%illtima> There was a scene like that in Johnny English 2
[2:14:59] <@Menitta> Quantum is not good
[2:14:59] <%Lion_kun> My favorite CR scene is the torture scene
[2:15:02] <%Juriasu> skyfall is fucking great solace is shit
[2:15:05] <@Menitta> skyfall is awesome
[2:15:08] <PanicSwytch> Quantum is meh
[2:15:10] <%dds333a> Skyfall is much better than QoS
[2:15:17] <iacus_> Quantum gets better on second viewing, but suffers from a lack of a clear villain
[2:15:17] <%Lion_kun> Skyfall is overrated
[2:15:27] <%dds333a> Yes
[2:15:28] <iacus_> I didn't like Skyfall that much tbh
[2:15:28] <%Lion_kun> But at least it's not Spectre lol
[2:15:44] <%dds333a> Classic Bond is episodic, like the novels
[2:15:49] <%Lion_kun> Spectre is so bad
[2:15:52] <%dds333a> absolutely
[2:15:58] <+Dr_DangerPhD> Casino Royale is probably my favorite bond movie
[2:16:15] <%Lion_kun> CR is easily the best Craig film
[2:16:18] <@Menitta> i wish Pierce Brosnan was in better movies. He's my favorite bond
[2:16:40] <%Juriasu> @Menitta you don't like Mama Mia Kappa

[2:27:47] <Solidnick18> yep
[2:27:48] <$eco419> ;o
[2:27:58] <%andrewofbob> And 3-zone runs can get LONG
[2:27:58] <leith_aziz> I actually know very little about this game. Interested in what makes the game so good
[2:28:00] <%derap41> Minh got a good gag going don't overdo it
[2:28:09] <majindusto> They Won't
[2:28:12] <leith_aziz> (since I don't own a PS5)
[2:28:15] <@Menitta> Not necessarily. if you find new weapons and such they carry over
[2:28:17] <Miklosher> hey put the cb mode on for minh!
[2:28:19] <majindusto> enigmaKEK
[2:28:26] <Johannen> No Colorblind mode)
[2:28:33] <%dds333a> @leith_aziz really! no way.
[2:28:35] <@Menitta> I beat this game and it's like no. 3 on my top 10.
[2:28:40] <@Menitta> it's so good
[2:28:43] <%Lion_kun> Same
[2:28:47] <+kullumanati> So why play? Ummmmmm
[2:28:48] <%X2Eliah> @Johannen ye, Minh isn't playing
[2:28:55] <Ziegsy> Whats yer other top ten?
[2:29:00] <+fetrigon> LUL
[2:29:01] <%andrewofbob> I have the Sunface fragments, then I was just burned out and kept choking

[2:29:08] <stevenellis386> yeyeyeye good luck wooly and crew
[2:29:10] <leith_aziz> In a galaxy far far away....
[2:29:15] <%dds333a> It didn't start with a wipe. so it cant be SW
[2:29:15] <%emperordread> Reggie Souls episode 2
[2:29:22] <drunken_lemur> It's really, really big
[2:29:25] <vstpnv> god when's metroid prime 4 tho
[2:29:27] <+fetrigon> rivet looks different...
[2:29:30] <morningmoondude> Samurai Gunn 2 looks so good
[2:29:31] <Ziegsy> ratchet was amazing
[2:29:50] <@Menitta> also there is some hard progress the farther you get in so not all is lost
[2:29:56] <%Lion_kun> AAA roguelike
[2:29:59] <iacus_> yeah this game is almost the same as Rogue
[2:30:04] <majindusto> Metroid Prime 4 will be so Hype
[2:30:06] <%andrewofbob> Never played a roguelike? prepare to die a lot
[2:30:10] <iacus_> Looks great
[2:30:12] <%dds333a> @iacus_ yeah. nearly identical
[2:30:15] <Johannen> Easier to do a rogue like in "2d"
[2:30:19] <%X2Eliah> @WoolieVersus Does the twitch game name matter? for me it still lists Samurai Gunn 2 just saying
[2:30:25] <+mechslayer71> was Reggie there for hades? or was it Minh? I think it was reggie
[2:30:32] <+fetrigon> is Metroid prime 4 still in development?
[2:30:40] <iacus_> oh no, got hit by the Returnal
[2:30:44] <stevenellis386> although this game has everything I want to expect for a new metroid.
[2:30:44] <Prevot> oh no she's gonna crash and lose all her powerups
[2:30:47] <%dds333a> @fetrigon yes. ideally. hopefully
[2:30:48] <drunken_lemur> They managed to hide it being a Rogue like pretty early on
[2:30:49] <%X2Eliah> well game over
[2:30:49] <Saltmeisterr> hey
[2:30:53] <Hericknhx> that means she's the protagonist PogChmap
[2:31:01] <majindusto> Still Samurai Gunn 2 for me too
[2:31:01] <stevenellis386> except the roguelike theme tho
[2:31:09] <Saltmeisterr> i returned after reporting my mission
[2:31:12] <mrblitzstream> @mechslayer71 yeah, it was reggie
[2:31:14] <%dds333a> She's gonna get hit by an energy bolt and start over Kappa
[2:31:16] <Saltmeisterr> and i brought food!
[2:31:20] <%andrewofbob> It nicely weaves the story around the roguelike structure
[2:31:34] <+kullumanati> If only for the save. Damn Housemaque. Could’ve been better. Can’t wait til that issue is fixed.
[2:31:36] <+mechslayer71> @mrblitzstream yeah I thought so
[2:31:38] <Johannen> Wasnt it like advertised as a GroundHog day The game? It was prety obvious somethign rogish was affot
[2:31:45] <%dds333a> Not doing too hot
[2:31:48] <@Menitta> god I'm so excited to get to a certain point in this game
[2:31:50] <%derap41> game over
[2:31:50] <%Lion_kun> The ending of this game was not what I was expecting but I dug it.
[2:32:02] <%derap41> And That's How my story Ended
[2:32:03] <vstpnv> @woolieversus game name is still Samurai Gunn 2 btw
[2:32:03] <+Selectamo> oh hey! I just beat this game!
[2:32:06] <%dds333a> @johannen yes
[2:32:06] <@Menitta> I wanna see their reactions. very excited
[2:32:13] <+Selectamo> This was great fun
[2:32:15] <%Lion_kun> The sun did not make it indeed.
[2:32:19] <Indigo_Automaton> That rotating collar on her suit is rad
[2:32:20] <majindusto> Game name fixed
[2:32:26] <@Menitta> oh the rumble is great
[2:32:26] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:32:29] <scrumbotime> oh the rumble is buckwild
[2:32:29] <Saltmeisterr> damn look at that fooliage
[2:32:43] <Ziegsy> Woolie is wrong. the best is astros playhouse
[2:32:51] <@Menitta> it does a better job than Ratchet I'd say
[2:32:52] <%Lion_kun> Best PS5 games are this, demons and ratchet
[2:32:58] <%andrewofbob> Astro's Playroom was the tech demo; Returnal is the gold standard.
[2:32:58] <majindusto> Play it Woolie
[2:32:59] <Johannen> Cant wait for the new game from Arcane Studios, Deathloop sound cool as heck with a similar premise
[2:33:00] <%Lion_kun> And Astro
[2:33:00] <%dds333a> @saltmeisterr I think you mean "foilage".
[2:33:03] <@Menitta> oh yeah Astro does a good job
[2:33:08] <leith_aziz> @Lion_kun Demon Souls? That was thiis year?
[2:33:19] <%Lion_kun> Best PS5 games I meant
[2:33:19] <Hericknhx> *there's not alot of PS5 games tbh*
[2:33:26] <%Lion_kun> That uses the ps5 well
[2:33:28] <PanicSwytch> So if progress resets on every run, does anything carry over?
[2:33:31] <%X2Eliah> There's not a lot of PS5s tbh
[2:33:31] <Prevot> too bad they will soon stop using it at all, like they always do with features like this
[2:33:45] <iacus_> those topographical effects are always cool

[2:34:41] <%dds333a> @dickiewoodsmall_279 I hate it when they play the thing at all
[2:34:42] <Indigo_Automaton> It's a lot like Death Stranding's scan too
[2:34:47] <yukichocomilk> air dashes? this is anime
[2:34:59] <iacus_> lucky to crash so close to a ruins site
[2:34:59] <@Menitta> this game doesn't really do a lot new but it really comes together for an insanely unique experience
[2:35:05] <%andrewofbob> Oh, it gets a bit more anime later
[2:35:08] <DickieWoodsmall_279> @dds333a I hate when young people
[2:35:11] <Hericknhx> I mean, she has two colors eyes KEKW
[2:35:13] <Prevot> after the Metroid series re-establishes itself with Dread and Prime 4 I'd like to see them try a 3rd person shooter like this

[2:37:37] <%dds333a> @iacus_ happens a lot with sticks, where they have spots where movement doesn't register, or locks
[2:37:37] <auraofdawn> man why does everything with a joystick so messed up these days
[2:37:48] <leith_aziz> My DS4 controller D-poad breaks so often
[2:37:54] <+black_pariah> try some compressed air, maybe? would that fix it?
[2:37:55] <Indigo_Automaton> The Index also has deadzone issue from the sticks wearing out
[2:37:55] <linSP> My rumble on my ps5 controller is busted, the noise is loud af
[2:37:56] <stevenellis386> idk ive never had this problem with my controller fortunately
[2:37:56] <leith_aziz> I've gotten like my 4th one now
[2:37:58] <%derap41> That's what 60-80 bucks to the wind
[2:37:58] <+polothegreatest> time to learn to solder electronics
[2:38:03] <%ekodrop> probably still under warranty
[2:38:05] <@Menitta> Microsoft has that for the Elite controllers iirc
[2:38:11] <%livlinn> does q-tip and contact spray fix this as well?
[2:38:16] <%ekodrop> get yo money back
[2:38:18] <kingbreaker21> @auraofdawn You mean like all of us guys? :P JK
[2:38:19] <%Irridium> My PS5 d-pad is fucked. Left button registers as up half the time.
[2:38:22] <%Lion_kun> Buy 2, break one, buy one.
[2:38:26] <%Irridium> makes strive real fun I can tell you that
[2:38:31] <%dds333a> My GC controller's wire is frayed to shit, but everything on it still works fine, but joystick drift is a rather common problem
[2:38:40] <leith_aziz> @Irridium I hear the PS5 D-pad is kinda iffy
[2:38:40] <Johannen> I was hoping that drift issue was not as big of a deal. Fock me then
[2:38:40] <SilverFaustX> the ps4 dpad has that also, left is up.
[2:38:53] <leith_aziz> @Irridium For FG's at least
[2:38:54] <%xeromage> Imagine how many times a day someone has a problem on console that would be fixable on PC
[2:39:03] <mrblitzstream> @WoolieVersus use your Arcade stick LUL LUL

[2:39:50] <%Irridium> all that rumble and speakers and motion babey
[2:39:54] <dylheim93> 70€
[2:39:54] <stevenellis386> controllers are too expensive now
[2:39:56] <DickieWoodsmall_279> if only these controllers were made with better materials or more games had kb+m support on console or you could tweak stick settings in software or any other of the hundreds of possible solutions
[2:40:12] <stevenellis386> 90$ CAD
[2:40:18] <%derap41> "fixed"
[2:40:21] <Hericknhx> legit, once I get some money I'll buy 3 BattleBeaves just so I don't have to deal with controllers
[2:40:25] <Pookiedaexzile> If only you could use any controller you wanted...or even a keyboard
[2:40:56] <fengxii> REGGIE

[2:41:54] <Johannen> This remind me about Venture Bros
[2:41:58] <%andrewofbob> It's kinda my thing
[2:41:59] <Pookiedaexzile> Spizzy Glizzy
[2:42:00] <@Menitta> [sees your own dead body] Oh no! Anyway
[2:42:03] <+Selectamo> haha I ran through this area, and then forgot completely about the switch mechanic
[2:42:15] <Hericknhx> "Oh man it's myself dead on the ground... Anyway"
[2:42:19] <+Selectamo> so I just wondered why some chests were locked behind doors
[2:42:31] <iacus_> so far not a lot of identification game in this roguelike
[2:42:31] <%dds333a> clearly
[2:42:41] <@Menitta> you get used to it fast
[2:42:52] <%dds333a> To be fair, that was pretty easy to tell
[2:42:55] <masterfire23> detective mode perma on
[2:43:04] <mrblitzstream> look at this pseed boi... zooom! Thats how the character runs xD
[2:43:11] <iacus_> wow.
[2:43:11] <%dds333a> cool, too
[2:43:12] <mrblitzstream> *speed
[2:43:17] <iacus_> abusing the scan pulse
[2:43:23] <brunoberserk> NEW GUNJUMPER
[2:43:23] <%Juriasu> puppers are here
[2:43:26] <+FuqBoiSlim> no pretty only shoot
[2:43:29] <%dds333a> Reg moving like Control LUL
[2:43:30] <Johannen> This is gonna get tiresome with the siezure inducing pulses
[2:43:30] <Hericknhx> DOGGIES PogChamp
[2:43:33] <%LastHazzerd> if i want to look at pretty i'll watch a movie
[2:43:36] <Prevot> hey it's the aliens from Edge of Tomorrow
[2:43:53] <%derap41> Nier did it betta
[2:43:53] <@Menitta> I was gonna say Edge of Tomorrow yeah
[2:44:00] <%dds333a> @prevot what about it's much better title Kappa
[2:44:15] <Pookiedaexzile> One fine day with a woof and a purr A baby was born and it caused a little stir No blue buzzard, no three-eyed frog Just a feline, canine little catdog Catdog Catdog
[2:44:16] <Hericknhx> oh I see, the murder boner
[2:44:19] <%LastHazzerd> that's surprisingly appropriate source
[2:44:21] <Prevot> the one that could apply to this game also? LUL
[2:44:22] <mrblitzstream> All you need is kill vibes
[2:44:22] <Hericknhx> good mechanic
[2:44:41] <%dds333a> @prevot indeed LUL LUL
[2:45:05] <iacus_> "rearranging themselves like... tilesets on a procedural game!"
[2:45:19] <%dds333a> Really nice of yourself to leave recordings
[2:45:26] <Hericknhx> it's like a cycle... that makes us do the returnal monkaS
[2:45:39] <%dds333a> Just general logging, like Annihilation
[2:45:51] <brunoberserk> oh no she is stuck in the IZANAMI
[2:45:54] <%derap41> If a system is good steal it
[2:46:02] <Pookiedaexzile> Minh knows whats up
[2:46:04] <%dds333a> there it is
[2:46:05] <@Menitta> oh yeah that's an amazing reload system
[2:46:06] <%andrewofbob> I hate the pistol because I'll spam the trigger then reload too early
[2:46:15] <@Menitta> it works so well especially with some buffs
[2:46:18] <Pookiedaexzile> Active Reload the clip, put some sauce on it
[2:46:21] <Johannen> Pls, my eyes are burning
[2:46:26] <iacus_> I've seen this in an anime
[2:46:36] <Hericknhx> touch the glowing tentacles
[2:46:36] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:46:40] <%dds333a> Beautiful bioluminescence
[2:46:41] <Prevot> active reload 🤝 action commands
[2:46:43] <Hericknhx> they'll give power
[2:46:51] <tomikaze_> only the statues with glowing eyes
[2:46:58] <%derap41> the fuck are those bullets
[2:46:59] <Johannen> Please ask Reggie to cool on the scans, kinda hurts
[2:47:00] <%dds333a> At least I assume "bio" LUL
[2:47:06] <iacus_> I think reggie is blind. up the brightess so he doesn't have to pulse every 2 seconds
[2:47:07] <%nabby1> who is playing?
[2:47:14] <%derap41> Reggie
[2:47:16] <%dds333a> Reg

[2:47:36] <%derap41> Wait the ancient greek penis herb?
[2:47:42] <%dds333a> He sent people LUL
[2:47:43] <Saltmeisterr> stickem up
[2:47:55] <+fetrigon> LUL
[2:48:03] <%dds333a> He brought out the goons
[2:48:09] <%nabby1> nabby1 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! 
[2:48:11] <Pookiedaexzile> Shout out the gang Woolie
[2:48:15] <%derap41> yeah Silphium is an extinct penis hardener
[2:48:23] <brunoberserk> CHOZO ?
[2:48:24] <%derap41> Romans ate it all
[2:48:29] <%andrewofbob> BLORB
[2:48:36] <Saltmeisterr> woolie never looks at chat :(
[2:48:42] <Pookiedaexzile> Overhuman
[2:49:02] <+fetrigon> they're doing an LP rn soooo...
[2:49:19] <gespenstkick> Chat has also been rather backseaty and spoilerish the last few streams
[2:49:21] <Saltmeisterr> i know lol
[2:49:33] <%derap41> Chat only got itself to blame
[2:49:34] <Saltmeisterr> i joke
[2:49:52] <Saltmeisterr> shame about chat being dumb tho
[2:49:58] <%derap41> Woolie and Reggie should work on a buddy system where one filters chat for the other
[2:50:05] <@Menitta> Aw what'd I miss
[2:50:08] <Deasmeister> I rebound it so I could spam it more
[2:50:09] <%dds333a> speak for yourself, only chat is dumb Kappa
[2:50:16] <+fetrigon> @saltmeisterr oh yeah I wasn't talking to you. Just anyone who might not understand.
[2:50:28] <%derap41> Binding of Isaac is the official passtime of Canada thanks to a Bald Eggman
[2:50:31] <Johannen> After Incredibles 2 how are these devs made such a siezure inducing scan is beyond me
[2:50:42] <+fetrigon> Minh
[2:50:48] <%dds333a> Risk and reward, baby
[2:50:49] <%andrewofbob> And sometimes you just don't get a malfunction
[2:50:51] <%ekodrop> what's your malfunction
[2:51:04] <@Menitta> oh the malfunctions are super not worth it
[2:51:06] <%andrewofbob> There are some perks that reward getting and fixing malfunctions
[2:51:07] <Pookiedaexzile> Its an augment that might have a malfunction
[2:51:10] <%derap41> Buff and Debuff
[2:51:12] <%ertwou> ertwou subscribed with Prime. 
[2:51:13] <%Broand> double the minh
[2:51:15] <%Lion_kun> They're never worth it
[2:51:16] <Pookiedaexzile> Trade offs
[2:51:16] <@Menitta> at least imo
[2:51:25] <%derap41> and some Debuffs can be good with right synergies
[2:51:37] <%derap41> Predator cannon
[2:51:39] <%andrewofbob> A malfunction on it's own sucks, but you gained something for the risk
[2:51:41] <Pookiedaexzile> Melee Build wen
[2:51:44] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ORB
[2:51:46] <%Dapper_Cactuar> there are also some cool builds you can do manipulating malfunctions
[2:51:49] <iacus_> event horizon shit
[2:51:52] <%dds333a> The Predator laser scouter
[2:51:53] <+fetrigon> its pat
[2:51:56] <Hericknhx> is that Pat dark form
[2:51:56] <DSD24> Nice reference Reggie
[2:52:00] <+black_pariah> I love that woolie ignores chat for the sake of the YT upload and Pat absolutely does not give a shit. That's them in a nutshell
[2:52:01] <gespenstkick> Retinal scan? Nah m8 gimme one of them Reginald scans
[2:52:10] <%derap41> Nah that's the orb from Astartes
[2:52:12] <Pookiedaexzile> Not Xenos
[2:52:14] <%dds333a> alternatively, that robot in Fallen Order
[2:52:16] <Pookiedaexzile> anything but xenos
[2:52:24] <iacus_> pat doesn't do yt, I think
[2:52:27] <+TheIndigoLlama> I really, REALLY love how H.R. Giger this game is
[2:52:30] <@Menitta> Sometimes they're like "get .01 less seconds of reload speed but get stabbed every time you enter a Lowes"
[2:52:37] <Pookiedaexzile> All Pat Does is Youtube Now
[2:52:46] <Pookiedaexzile> :)
[2:52:48] <%dds333a> @iacus_ he all but abandoned it, he uploads the VODs, and that's it
[2:52:52] <+black_pariah> @Pookiedaexzile oof

[2:54:47] <gespenstkick> Killed by Sammael the Desolate One
[2:54:58] <Pookiedaexzile> Somewhere an old lady is remembering this moment
[2:55:01] <DSD24> You got title dropped
[2:55:24] <Hericknhx> oh shit we PT now
[2:55:31] <TWOxACROSS> Oh man, givin' Returnal a go!
[2:55:36] <iacus_> the Returnal got ya!
[2:55:36] <Papa_Shu> yeah wasn't expecting first person
[2:55:43] <+fetrigon> @pookiedaexzile thanks shivers
[2:55:56] <Hericknhx> I remember when I saw the triler that started with the corridor and door my heart skipped a bit
[2:56:01] <%dds333a> Hit so hard you started remembering what you ate for breakfast that morning
[2:56:03] <DSD24> Wingdings?
[2:56:04] <Dannzzyy> This game is tight.
[2:56:07] <Hericknhx> but then it was Retirnal
[2:56:08] <+black_pariah> @gespenstkick where's hellboy when you need him
[2:56:10] <Hericknhx> still cool
[2:56:45] <Hericknhx> lmao
[2:56:48] <Talen99> DEADPAN
[2:56:53] <iacus_> getting "repatriate" vibes
[2:56:53] <%dds333a> Reggie got it too LUL
[2:57:18] <%dds333a> Oh. I can see those dreams getting tight later
[2:57:21] <Hericknhx> Woolie is really a kuudere most of the times huh Kappa
[2:57:44] <TWOxACROSS> When you are walking out of the ship, you can hold X to skip the animation to get back into it quicker
[2:57:45] <%dds333a> Back in it
[2:57:54] <@Menitta> I'm excited for Reggie to get to the point of "I got hit once near the start. RESTART RUN"
[2:57:54] <gespenstkick> The cycle, AKA the loop
[2:57:55] <Pookiedaexzile> Clean ya Damn ship
[2:58:14] <%dds333a> And then the Dragon God kills you
[2:58:16] <Hericknhx> there's have to be a video of a person beating the game in first try
[2:58:16] <%derap41> Such a bad name
[2:58:21] <Talen99> Is ThIs A RoGuElIkE?
[2:58:28] <Pookiedaexzile> Do it perfect first try
[2:58:32] <iacus_> All You Need is Kill is the superior title
[2:58:35] <sushahana> you want any kill?
[2:58:45] <@Menitta> God the manga was so good
[2:58:46] <Pookiedaexzile> Kill is on the Menu
[2:58:46] <%derap41> Hey kids....want some Kill?
[2:58:57] <%livlinn> I prefer the original ending
[2:59:00] <Pookiedaexzile> I can't believe its not Kill
[2:59:01] <Hericknhx> Edge of Tomorrow was cool
[2:59:07] <Hericknhx> I like that movie
[2:59:10] <%dds333a> Play it enough, and you will get it down
[2:59:16] <+skylerpilot> yeah, I got through the first half of the game without dying
[2:59:21] <@Menitta> Edge of Tomorrow was good yeah but that manga was fire
[2:59:22] <%derap41> @Hericknhx Yeah Tom Cruise is still a creep Scientologist though
[2:59:26] <%dds333a> entire structures will eventially become knowable
[2:59:28] <+skylerpilot> the first time
[2:59:40] <@Menitta> I'd like to read the book at some point
[2:59:42] <iacus_> true roguelikes are very random, you win by developing tactics for every possible situation. That's probably not viable for realtime procedural games
[2:59:43] <Hericknhx> @derap41 don't worry about it
[2:59:43] <+black_pariah> the frank grillo one?
[2:59:55] <%dds333a> @derap41 eh, great actor tho
[2:59:57] <masterfire23> I think it's on hulu too
[3:00:07] <iacus_> looks like a demon
[3:00:08] <DSD24> This hole was made for me?
[3:00:09] <Mundkipz> ya frank grillo
[3:00:12] <Pookiedaexzile> Tom Cruise is more of a Movie star than an actor
[3:00:36] <%dds333a> @pookiedaexzile is there a difference Kappa
[3:00:36] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:00:43] <%derap41> @dds333a Sure but there are a lot of great actors
[3:00:44] <gespenstkick> @Pookiedaexzile I like that wording a lot
[3:01:04] <%andrewofbob> tbh, ether has a cap and two uses: unlocks, and being a cheapskate with the difficulty
[3:01:07] <Rahvith> !uptime
[3:01:08] <@Moobot> @Rahvith WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 1 minute
[3:01:08] <%dds333a> @derap41 yeah, regardless of what they believe
[3:01:51] <%derap41> @dds333a Just joining a cult might get you that extra
[3:02:11] <%dds333a> @derap41 good stuff, I assume LUL
[3:02:29] <%LastHazzerd> infinite ammo, not infinite clip
[3:02:37] <%dds333a> Unfortunately, I don't know Xenu well enough to know Kappa
[3:04:06] <gespenstkick> Needs timestop
[3:04:20] <Saltmeisterr> needs timestop
[3:04:29] <DedlokPM> Definitely timestop. psaWhat
[3:04:31] <scrumbotime> i was lucky enough to get a ps5 so i can confirm, the feedback with this game was just on a degree that is almost ridiculous
[3:04:36] <+fetrigon> needs timestop

[3:04:41] <@Moobot> @dapperskeleton69 WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 4 minutes

[3:07:49] <Hydrapissed> well I mean we assuming we the good guy now lol
[3:07:50] <Pookiedaexzile> Reggie Cripping confirmed
[3:07:54] <+fetrigon> MrDestructoid tell me what to believe
[3:07:59] <TWOxACROSS> you only get one weapon
[3:08:01] <Deasmeister> you dont
[3:08:06] <scrumbotime> lol, what "change" weapon
[3:08:07] <%andrewofbob> Change weapons by standing over a weapon
[3:08:18] <usurper_sos> you only have one weapon
[3:08:37] <%derap41> not always an equal trade
[3:09:04] <%dds333a> homing
[3:09:20] <%andrewofbob> Secondary is a lightning attack; hold it
[3:09:24] <Deasmeister> hold alt fire
[3:09:40] <%andrewofbob> The carbine is auto, so hold that too
[3:09:52] <Johannen> Chonk
[3:09:52] <+Otsgekee> Damn I want ps5 for this
[3:10:13] <%dds333a> That's a neat name
[3:10:39] <TWOxACROSS> man, bummed that I finished the game right around when they added showing items on the map. Before you just had to remember something was in another room
[3:11:11] <%dds333a> side dashin
[3:11:17] <%andrewofbob> They thankfully changed the colour of ethers on the map; they used to be red
[3:11:29] <+Meathands> It restores your MP
[3:11:35] <TWOxACROSS> so many QoL changes made
[3:11:39] <PMda2nd> use the ether in beef
[3:11:50] <+Meathands> Or to freebase cocaine
[3:12:00] <TWOxACROSS> triangles are items
[3:12:19] <TWOxACROSS> obolite chunks, consumables, stuff like that
[3:12:44] <%dds333a> Still living? cmonBruh
[3:14:07] <%derap41> gonna be honest the stream compression is making the screen just a big smear
[3:14:08] <scrumbotime> why do i get the feeling that he is halfway holding down the right trigger
[3:14:17] <Johannen> You mean like in God of War?
[3:14:27] <iacus_> OwOlites

[3:15:10] <%dds333a> shmups where you have to upgrade for points to go to you is a bit of a hassle
[3:15:40] <+xpakeo> did they ever add some sort of save to this game?
[3:15:51] <%andrewofbob> The level system really drags out runs if you intend to win
[3:16:26] <TWOxACROSS> LOL
[3:16:29] <Johannen> But when are you gonna get a timestop?
[3:16:54] <Indigo_Automaton> Those look cool
[3:16:56] <TWOxACROSS> they are kinda slow to react, so if you move quick, you're still good

[3:22:52] <TWOxACROSS> not specifically to test, but explore
[3:22:55] <Pookiedaexzile> Not on herself....I don't think
[3:23:03] <Pookiedaexzile> That would be a shitty job

[3:24:24] <TWOxACROSS> Malignancy also isn't bad unless you have two already
[3:24:33] <TWOxACROSS> Because you can fix those
[3:24:50] <%Lion_kun> there is a malfunction that damages you on drops
[3:24:52] <Pookiedaexzile> That spheres pretty good, hope nothing happens to it
[3:26:07] <Pookiedaexzile> Woolie known xenophile down to be infected by xeno virus weapons
[3:26:30] <Pookiedaexzile> *Weapons of mass destruction
[3:26:42] <DSD24> @Pookiedaexzile He did sell out during the XCOM playthough for a jetpack
[3:27:04] <Pookiedaexzile> But now he's putting the jetpack on the inside
[3:27:06] <Meltgar> OH DAMN i missed GUN 2
[3:27:52] <%Lion_kun> THAT IS GOOOOOOOD
[3:27:56] <%Lion_kun> SAVE UP FOR THE LEECH
[3:28:14] <%andrewofbob> Leech will help so much against mobs
[3:28:15] <zzNamttamzz> Leech is OP
[3:28:28] <Johannen> Wait...you leave your proficency with the weapon?
[3:28:29] <%andrewofbob> Bosses, more of a one time event
[3:28:30] <Pookiedaexzile> Leech will make you live
[3:28:49] <%Lion_kun> at level 5 adrenaline, it's 10% per hit
[3:28:50] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:28:51] <%andrewofbob> @Johannen Proficiancy improves the guns you find
[3:28:51] <DSD24> Life steal builds are fun
[3:28:59] <%Lion_kun> they nerfed it in the patch from 25% and it's still OP
[3:29:02] <Rahvith> Life steal is op in any game LUL
[3:29:34] <Johannen> @andrewofbob Woolie said when you find a new gun you leave that behind when disscusion proficency
[3:29:40] <TheHeroAppears> they balance life steal pretty good in hades
[3:29:41] <%andrewofbob> And then there's the lifesteal perk on the carbine...
[3:29:54] <%dds333a> @rahvith Leech and Life Drain sucks in SMT, but Drain in Devil Survivor is OP LUL
[3:30:25] <Johannen> That's just like in Tomb Raider
[3:30:46] <Pookiedaexzile> If the designers know: Life Drain sucks If the Designers don't know : Life Drain breaks the game
[3:30:53] <%andrewofbob> @Johannen If you dump your level 0 starter pistol on the floor and get 4 levels, your starter pistol remains at level 0
[3:31:10] <%dds333a> @pookiedaexzile truth LUL
[3:31:22] <Johannen> @andrewofbob So it is tied to a weapon and not a character? That kinda dumb
[3:31:24] <%dds333a> beautiful
[3:31:28] <TWOxACROSS> Proficiency on a weapon is for learning the traits on that weapon type when you find them later
[3:31:29] <%Lion_kun> groot teleports
[3:31:36] <DSD24> Zero Shift lets go
[3:31:50] <%andrewofbob> @Johannen Yeah, character levels affect stat rolls when weapons drop
[3:31:59] <TWOxACROSS> Proficiency for the player increases the potency of the weapons you pick up
[3:32:06] <%dds333a> Plant-Man has you in his sights
[3:32:17] <Pookiedaexzile> The sound track isn't displaying the need for Doom like movement
[3:32:38] <%dds333a> Nearly didn't make it LUL
[3:32:38] <Pookiedaexzile> You need to be ripping AND tearing Reggie
[3:33:01] <%Lion_kun> staying close to groot helps, he doesn't use those long range attacks
[3:33:13] <%dds333a> oh hey

[3:33:51] <%andrewofbob> How long until the stagger system gets explained
[3:34:03] <DSD24> Selene seems like a surgical knife rather then ripping and tearing like Doom Slayer
[3:34:11] <%dds333a> This could be your new thang
[3:34:11] <iacus_> these don't look randomized
[3:34:31] <@Menitta> The spit mall can be amazing
[3:34:35] <TWOxACROSS> @andrewofbob oh right I forget if they ever explain it
[3:34:46] <TWOxACROSS> Theerrrre's the stagger mechanics
[3:34:53] <%dds333a> Blasted
[3:34:57] <DSD24> He gave it his best shot

[3:35:32] <Indigo_Automaton> Time for the tourniquet
[3:35:36] <Pookiedaexzile> The ArmHugger is friend
[3:35:38] <DSD24> His name is Terry
[3:35:41] <Johannen> Kevin from the movie Life?
[3:35:49] <TWOxACROSS> Parasites are also marked as triangles on the map

[3:36:51] <%andrewofbob> @Talen99 Except for the ones that revive you, I would think
[3:36:52] <DSD24> Is Selene gonna get a biomechanical suit at the end of this? she's shoving all the parasites on her
[3:37:04] <%andrewofbob> "Would you like this debuff or death?"
[3:37:08] <Pookiedaexzile> Body Horror Samus by the end of the run
[3:37:12] <%dds333a> @dsd24 Selene becomes the Guyver
[3:37:22] <%dds333a> or Zeiram
[3:37:30] <Johannen> Is Samus is even a human by the end of her adventures?
[3:37:32] <TWOxACROSS> Ooo ooo I'm RETURNING~
[3:37:33] <DSD24> @dds333a THat's exactly who I was thinking of
[3:37:33] <%dds333a> or Baoh
[3:37:49] <Pookiedaexzile> or Pyscho Rangers
[3:38:41] <%andrewofbob> Backtracking is how I get 6-hour clears
[3:38:56] <%andrewofbob> IIRC they're all guns
[3:38:58] <%dds333a> I'll get you... later
[3:38:59] <iacus_> can you open all 3?
[3:39:02] <TWOxACROSS> it'll always tell if you it's malignant
[3:39:07] <TWOxACROSS> Yeah you can open all three
[3:39:14] <TWOxACROSS> But you can only come there once
[3:39:41] <+fetrigon> did he go back to get the leech chat?

[3:54:56] <TWOxACROSS> BUT YOU'VE LEARNED SO MUCH
[3:55:01] <KeiganOfAstora> They should trade off every time they die
[3:55:06] <%dds333a> Man-Thing wins again
[3:55:08] <+beansoup> lol i joined as soon as the run ended. This is on me guys i'm sorry
[3:55:12] <Medo3G> Returnaled
[3:55:16] <%cobalt_phoenix_> LET'S GO MINH
[3:55:19] <KeiganOfAstora> Nice I like that they're trading off
[3:55:24] <%dds333a> @beansoup LUL
[3:55:30] <%andrewofbob> How could you, @beansoup ?
[3:55:43] <Johannen> Another SOMA hole?
[3:56:00] <TWOxACROSS> lol Minh right in Reggie's camera
[3:56:25] <%athuramn> it adds a special touch
[3:56:44] <+covo375> the rumble in the new ratchet is really good too
[3:56:49] <%andrewofbob> Room 1 death?
[3:56:52] <TWOxACROSS> notice how that hole is punching inward~
[3:57:09] <TWOxACROSS> Taking naps on the ship is basically worthless now :/
[3:57:12] <rReizs> naps were nerfed right
[3:57:17] <TWOxACROSS> You get like 10 integrity
[3:57:17] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:57:17] <rReizs> because max was abusing them
[3:57:27] <%Lion_kun> no manual reloading
[3:57:35] <%andrewofbob> Reload when you want is "just wait"
[3:57:37] <+covo375> nope, time based or active reload on empty
[3:57:40] <TWOxACROSS> Ammo slowly recharges when not in use
[3:57:43] <Mundkipz> it auto reloads back to full
[3:57:58] <SilverFaustX> theres auto reload
[3:58:12] <%Lion_kun> is Minh holding the fire buton>
[3:58:19] <%Lion_kun> Is Minh holding the fire button?
[3:58:50] <+beansoup> my introduction was Hades i was late on the rogue-like/lite train
[3:59:12] <Indigo_Automaton> Enter the Gungeon is also excellent
[3:59:15] <%andrewofbob> The satisfaction in beating roguelike is because you master the game, not necessarily because you we given power over time
[3:59:23] <%dds333a> More traditional Roguelikes and Lites can be extremely different yeah. TGGW is good about that
[3:59:40] <+tempestzephyr> oh right lol
[4:00:11] <TWOxACROSS> oh the bloodstain mechanic
[4:00:13] <Johannen> @dds333a TTGW?
[4:01:00] <TWOxACROSS> The scout corpse mechanic was bugged for most of my playtime, so I didn't start finding them until I had finished the story and was going for the platinum
[4:01:31] <%dds333a> @The Ground Gives Way
[4:01:45] <%dds333a> @johannen
[4:01:45] <%LastHazzerd> OKAY, i turned of flux and now can see the game much better
[4:01:47] <+beansoup> @TWOxACROSS yeah same here. Finished the story and never saw it once.
[4:02:03] <%dds333a> That also reminds me of Crypt, which is also pretty different between runs
[4:02:24] <%dds333a> except for 1-1
[4:02:52] <laguerrilha> How is the game for minh who has color blindness? is he able to handle it?
[4:03:13] <TWOxACROSS> TIme for D A S H
[4:03:16] <%dds333a> Thankfully there's a Colorblind mode
[4:03:16] <%andrewofbob> Just i-frame through it
[4:03:37] <TWOxACROSS> it's like an LMG
[4:03:38] <%athuramn> this makes the color palette slightly more interesting
[4:03:45] <%LastHazzerd> i do enjoy seeing what colorblind mode does in various games
[4:03:47] <+skylerpilot> Hollowseeker is amazing
[4:03:48] <laguerrilha> i am glad more games now days have color blind mode.
[4:03:52] <%Lion_kun> wait how did Minh get the holowseeker?
[4:03:58] <%dds333a> @athuramn I feel ya LUL
[4:04:03] <%Lion_kun> I thought you had to be in the second biome to get it.
[4:04:06] <+beansoup> i think when i played hollowseeker was the "meta" but i really, really liked the carbine
[4:04:15] <TWOxACROSS> guess they changed it
[4:04:35] <%andrewofbob> For me it's heal-carbine or slug-spitmaw
[4:04:35] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1417355334386061312?s=19
[4:04:39] <TWOxACROSS> @beansoup yeah, hollowseeker got me through a lot, but i loved getting a carbine with Hardened and Lifeleech
[4:04:47] <laguerrilha> also would like if games had a "no fast flashing lights" for people with seizures
[4:04:48] <KahnWick> Minh's face in the Reggie cam lol
[4:04:49] <%Lion_kun> early hollowseeker is pretty bad but becomes god tier when you unlock the upgrades
[4:05:22] <%LastHazzerd> flyer stuck
[4:05:26] <TWOxACROSS> i have cheesed so many rooms with the phasing rounds lol
[4:05:33] <%LastHazzerd> this looks like alien
[4:05:36] <laguerrilha> lot of games have a lot of light effects going on and this makes so many people with seizures cant play nothing
[4:05:46] <%dds333a> @lasthazzerd I CAN'T MOVE MAN
[4:05:49] <sleepy_pixels> Reggie! look out behind you"
[4:05:49] <kingofjibs> YO that Min dual cam action
[4:06:22] <PortableBoredom> God, Minh being on two cameras is goofy
[4:06:43] <kingofjibs> I think it's part of that dokapon bounus he got
[4:06:49] <+skylerpilot> no, not permanent. For the run
[4:06:49] <%athuramn> it's like video calling grandparents @portableboredom
[4:06:51] <%SomeAsianDood> not permanently
[4:06:58] <TWOxACROSS> If you pick up health when at max, it'll go towards pips to increase your max
[4:07:08] <PortableBoredom> If Minh isn't on two cameras, everyone should be asking "Where's Minh?"
[4:07:15] <TWOxACROSS> lol
[4:07:18] <%dds333a> @kingofjibs The Dokage is too powerful to be contained to one screen.
[4:07:30] <+beansoup> can we put a mirror behind woolie for a third shot of minh?
[4:07:34] <%andrewofbob> Collect a parasite
[4:08:13] <TWOxACROSS> parasites don't count towards malfunctions that cause criticals
[4:08:30] <Djinnazz> Score!

[4:11:41] <laguerrilha> this looks such a fun Metroid game, shame it isnt on PC
[4:11:45] <TWOxACROSS> yeah gates always have a switch to unlock it nearby
[4:11:55] <%dds333a> avoid
[4:12:15] <%dds333a> unless it's a game where you want to STAY in the light
[4:12:21] <TWOxACROSS> no that's Ether
[4:12:26] <%dds333a> so it's not completely ubiquitious
[4:12:27] <laguerrilha> Alan Wake?
[4:12:28] <TWOxACROSS> the purple with gold flakes
[4:12:41] <%dds333a> @laguerrilha exactly

[4:13:34] <Deasmeister> hp
[4:13:36] <Talen99> Have they been switching off periodically? That's fun I think they should do it more.
[4:13:36] <rReizs> resin is hp boost
[4:13:45] <iacus_> how can it be cheating
[4:14:02] <TWOxACROSS> specifically, Resin is the HP Up
[4:14:19] <laguerrilha> nice speed run strat
[4:14:20] <TWOxACROSS> Slphium is just what'll replenish HP
[4:14:27] <%andrewofbob> Time to gamble

[4:15:06] <rReizs> go for another chest first
[4:15:14] <heartlesshealer> equipment
[4:15:26] <Djinnazz> equipment
[4:16:10] <rReizs> ether is the first one
[4:16:15] <Deasmeister> top
[4:16:59] <%andrewofbob> Use the translocation sphere now
[4:16:59] <TWOxACROSS> god i love the meaty sounds in this game
[4:17:08] <Johannen> One slot? Then why there are 3 slots ?
[4:17:11] <heartlesshealer> transform projectiles or random teleport
[4:17:26] <%dds333a> come back, and see what happens
[4:17:28] <TWOxACROSS> that'll take you to a secret room, and will bring you right back when you're done
[4:17:36] <%andrewofbob> The "somewhere" is an extra area
[4:17:44] <TWOxACROSS> no
[4:17:48] <laguerrilha> no
[4:17:48] <+skylerpilot> no its a secret room
[4:17:51] <AncelDeLambert> sounds like a great way to teleport into shit
[4:17:53] <%SomeAsianDood> no
[4:17:55] <heartlesshealer> medium idea
[4:18:01] <laguerrilha> you might fight harder stuff
[4:18:01] <TWOxACROSS> lol
[4:18:07] <heartlesshealer> :)
[4:18:08] <Brandon__Brando> gamble
[4:18:09] <Hydrapissed> LET EM GABMLE LOL
[4:18:09] <%dds333a> Do it, why not LUL
[4:18:09] <iacus_> the malfunction mechanic is pretty cool
[4:18:11] <Hydrapissed> do it MID BOSS lol
[4:18:14] <TWOxACROSS> it's not an escape item, basically
[4:18:16] <%andrewofbob> Random next room, or random extra room?
[4:18:16] <%LastHazzerd> you're not playing CORRECTLY
[4:18:16] <%livlinn> woolieYE
[4:18:18] <iacus_> i like that you can get rid of it by playing well
[4:18:19] <gespenstkick> Minh playstyle colliding lol
[4:18:20] <Johannen> Backseat Woolie grumble)
[4:18:21] <AncelDeLambert> it's a roguelike, take opportunities to get shit
[4:18:24] <%dds333a> I predict you will NOT be able to use it that way LUL
[4:18:31] <heartlesshealer> it makes sense, but so does woolie
[4:18:35] <iacus_> Woolies strategy makes more sense

[4:19:12] <heartlesshealer> and you drop into the same room you escaped from anyway
[4:19:16] <TWOxACROSS> lol true
[4:19:19] <Hydrapissed> ming gambling hes saftey into the Unknown place lol
[4:19:25] <Hydrapissed> coulda been a lava room
[4:20:09] <heartlesshealer> change bullets into money
[4:20:11] <Hydrapissed> bullets to money
[4:20:23] <TWOxACROSS> good for when a boss does a bullet hell
[4:20:35] <%dds333a> The Danmaku Bomb classic
[4:20:36] <AncelDeLambert> every time Minh leans forward, Reggie's camera looks like a Warcraft Ogre Mage
[4:21:28] <%SomeAsianDood> which one would be the caster? @AncelDeLambert
[4:21:35] <TWOxACROSS> they leave themselves WIDE open when they are aiming with the laser
[4:21:43] <%andrewofbob> Next week: Heroes of the Storm, featuring Cho'Gall
[4:22:09] <Hydrapissed> melee
[4:22:30] <heartlesshealer> :)

[4:23:37] <Mundkipz> no, you need to get closer
[4:23:48] <Rahvith> That gun is nuts
[4:23:48] <heartlesshealer> active mode
[4:23:52] <TWOxACROSS> no if you're using sighted aiming with a full L2 press, it highlights enemies and their weak points

[4:24:39] <TheHeroAppears> minh being in reggie's cam breaks the illusion of minh being elevated on a very high chair
[4:25:02] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @AncelDeLambert
[4:25:56] <%dds333a> Bullet Time, hell yeah
[4:25:56] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:25:59] <TWOxACROSS> it's sadly not as good as other bullet times :c
[4:26:04] <TheHeroAppears> 10 jojo seconds
[4:26:27] <laguerrilha> this run?
[4:26:43] <Djinnazz> no
[4:26:45] <Deasmeister> No for the run
[4:26:56] <%andrewofbob> Weapon in hands is static
[4:27:14] <TWOxACROSS> weapon proficiency is the white meter at the bottom
[4:27:25] <TWOxACROSS> it determines how good the weapons you pick up will be
[4:27:35] <%dds333a> of course
[4:28:02] <Johannen> Some Eldritch shit
[4:28:16] <%dds333a> Love how the translation is getting there
[4:28:23] <TheHeroAppears> octodad has awakened
[4:28:31] <%hax_metatron> Have they talked about controller haptics in this game? Best of all time?
[4:28:43] <%livlinn> Squid1 Squid3 Squid4
[4:28:53] <+BigBruthaThunda> careful brudda
[4:29:05] <+skylerpilot> the actual story to this game is incredibly dark
[4:29:11] <%dds333a> God, that's fucking awful
[4:29:22] <%dds333a> And the fez thing was a huge debacle
[4:29:41] <reonome> how far in is woolie
[4:29:59] <%dds333a> Seems like Woolz himself finished it
[4:30:17] <laguerrilha> Hyper Light Drifter had a secret language, but it gave you roseta stones, not the translation. people had to decode it
[4:30:17] <%dds333a> The other two are going through it
[4:30:18] <%andrewofbob> You should be killing up close to not lose money, anyway
[4:30:34] <iacus_> @hax_metatron yeah they praised the haptics
[4:31:04] <Rahvith> money<life dont @ me
[4:31:37] <%dds333a> Parasyte is pretty alright yeah. The manga lacks a bit of meaningful character development, but it's alright Kappa
[4:31:41] <TWOxACROSS> but less healing :p
[4:31:58] <laguerrilha> dont need more life if you dont get hit
[4:32:07] <%andrewofbob> @Rahvith It's true; dying with a huge stack of obolites sucks
[4:32:18] <%dds333a> @laguerrilha the DMC meta
[4:32:20] <rReizs> weapon proficiency basically increases the rarity of your weapon drops
[4:33:11] <Rahvith> Lore PogChamp

[4:36:26] <%dukenux> IN THE FIRST AGE
[4:36:49] <%dds333a> @dukenux Yeah, I was getting Aliens, and Prometheus. but I didn't want to say it LUL
[4:37:08] <%andrewofbob> It's scary how conflict invites desperate innovation, WWII is why computers were invented, which are the ancestors to games consoles
[4:37:11] <laguerrilha> getting a PS5 its the first game i want to get
[4:37:11] <%dds333a> moreso the latter, really
[4:37:34] <%dukenux> @dds333a oh no, it's obviously inspired by Ridley Scott. the giant alien holograms are especially like Prometheus thing
[4:37:53] <+Jorm_Plays> whos playing min?
[4:37:54] <%dds333a> @dukenux indeed
[4:38:03] <%dds333a> @jorm_plays ye
[4:38:03] <%dukenux> although i hear that the story is actually better LUL
[4:38:25] <%dds333a> @dukenux I fucking bet LUL
[4:39:06] <rReizs> when you break the lower bar they stagger
[4:39:10] <%dds333a> OUCH
[4:39:51] <teh_Question> ADS can really mess you up in this game
[4:39:58] <%dukenux> >suit integrity low

[4:41:00] <@Menitta> Ok how farr has he gotten
[4:41:03] <%LastHazzerd> well that does say something about the function of the color blind mode
[4:41:04] <laguerrilha> it doesnt look bad on color blind mode so its fine
[4:41:06] <%dds333a> he was dying, so yeah
[4:41:06] <$SilverRoddo> Minh! bitterDab
[4:41:13] <@Menitta> Aw yeah he found the best gun
[4:41:15] <+BigBruthaThunda> based and (?)pilled
[4:41:26] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @BigBruthaThunda LUL
[4:41:28] <+aWanderingKaivo> woah I didn't see Minh at first in the corner there lol
[4:41:29] <%dukenux> "nah man i can make it" 10 seconds later...
[4:41:32] <+Bogart4321> darnabit
[4:41:33] <%LastHazzerd> wow, calling Minh a cripple
[4:41:47] <heartlesshealer> minh, engrave new color changes into your memory
[4:41:55] <%xeromage> There are lots of colorblind people who probably appreciate Minh testing that aspect for them
[4:41:56] <%LastHazzerd> Weeeeeee
[4:42:07] <%andrewofbob> SLUG SHOT
[4:42:17] <%cobalt_phoenix_> it looks pretty good still with this setting
[4:42:37] <rReizs> everyone likes the hollowseeker
[4:42:39] <+aWanderingKaivo> "homing shotgun" is a word combo I am a fan of though
[4:42:40] <@Menitta> yeah keep the hollowseeker
[4:42:41] <%dds333a> @xeromage oh, absolutely
[4:42:48] <rReizs> but then ELECTROPYLON DRIVER
[4:43:02] <@Menitta> Although the Hollowseeker gets really good later on
[4:43:13] <laguerrilha> yeah this game is great to watch
[4:43:15] <%dds333a> Neither did Reggie LUL
[4:43:23] <%andrewofbob> I just can't get along with the Dreadbound; I miss 3 shots and the gun spurns me
[4:43:28] <heartlesshealer> a ladder that hurts you
[4:43:29] <Mundkipz> you can ride them up like elevators
[4:43:36] <%dds333a> although you're both getting it
[4:43:38] <gespenstkick> Not knowing what to do is the most fun part of a lot of videogames
[4:43:41] <%LastHazzerd> how the turn tables. yeah it's fun to watch folk play this game
[4:43:47] <%livlinn> Squid1 Squid2 Squid4

[4:44:47] <Mundkipz> you missed thhe ledge in the wallll
[4:44:49] <TWOxACROSS> there's usually something midway through the drop
[4:44:58] <Mundkipz> three blind mice
[4:45:17] <%dds333a> @mundkipz with six sets of eyes Kappa
[4:45:46] <TWOxACROSS> it's kinda easy to miss
[4:45:47] <Mundkipz> too many eyes
[4:45:51] <TWOxACROSS> the map is like your one hint
[4:45:53] <%andrewofbob> Woolie drops down for style points with the hero landing LUL
[4:46:10] <TWOxACROSS> it's a hole in the wall, you'll have to airdash in while falling
[4:46:13] <Rahvith> 2 Hindsight eyes>6 mortal eyes
[4:46:25] <%dds333a> @mundkipz according to the God of War LP, it's accurate

[4:48:02] <%andrewofbob> Red Queen is a sadist, making them dance before pulling the trump card
[4:48:04] <Djinnazz> it was the best thing from that whole franchise.
[4:48:07] <laguerrilha> Why get the Rock if you are not even getting a monster to kill him?
[4:48:15] <%dukenux> i didn't know you could turn into a forest sprite in this game
[4:48:38] <%dukenux> sleep on the creepy rock altar
[4:48:41] <+aWanderingKaivo> you got SLIMED
[4:48:44] <%dukenux> ...Major Tom?
[4:48:44] <laguerrilha> whait no wrong one, it was another famous actor
[4:49:25] <%andrewofbob> Buzz Aldran is chasing you to punch you in the face
[4:49:31] <%dds333a> @laguerrilha I was gonna say, I'm like. "Doom"?
[4:49:33] <teh_Question> ah yes, Returnal, the game where you're on a spoopy planet being chased by The Fury
[4:49:48] <%ekodrop> just once now
[4:49:50] <%dukenux> "Noo Buzz stop, we already got our ass to Mars"
[4:49:50] <+skylerpilot> used to be infinite, that wasn't intended. Its 1 per run now
[4:49:51] <Djinnazz> just the once
[4:49:51] <%hax_metatron> Can’t wait for Woolie and Reggie to “sleep” in Disco Elysium
[4:49:52] <%ekodrop> think they patched it
[4:49:55] <%dds333a> @laguerrilha I don't remember his name either
[4:50:17] <%dukenux> that's a nice american bungalow on this alien planet
[4:50:18] <TWOxACROSS> and it only gives you like a SLIVER of health
[4:50:23] <%dukenux> reminds me of Evil Within 2
[4:50:27] <laguerrilha> Colin Salmon is the laser room guy
[4:51:06] <chambatron> Hmm I don't remember that enemy
[4:51:08] <%dds333a> @dukenux call me nuts, but the first thing I thought of on the teleport is Shadow the Hedgehog's organic teleport pathways
[4:51:13] <%dukenux> So to those who have read/watched "Solaris": Does this game borrows much from it?
[4:51:28] <%dukenux> *borrow
[4:51:35] <TWOxACROSS> full L2 aim will also highlight enemies, so you can see them
[4:51:51] <laguerrilha> this game borrows more of Metroid and Edge of Tomorrow than anything
[4:51:56] <%andrewofbob> Hollowseeker
[4:52:04] <chambatron> Has woolie finished the game already?
[4:52:07] <TWOxACROSS> and phasing rounds
[4:52:29] <%dds333a> wanna risk it?
[4:52:35] <%hax_metatron> Best Shotgun of 2021 is Ratchet and Clank however
[4:52:54] <%andrewofbob> That was lucky; items stack
[4:53:05] <+skylerpilot> all of the Hollowseeker augments are great, Serrated, Retarget, Phasing, both Portals
[4:53:12] <%dukenux> Wait what's this? A blu ray of "Ride with Norman Reedus" from AMC?
[4:53:16] <%andrewofbob> @hax_metatron Mozambique or gtfo
[4:53:35] <+skylerpilot> Serrated, Portal Beam and Turret are amazing
[4:54:20] <+aWanderingKaivo> one sound has so much meaning
[4:54:29] <%hax_metatron> @andrewofbob Have to check that one out, but the Ratchet and Clank shogun with the PS5 controller is an EXPERIENCE

[4:55:18] <+aWanderingKaivo> man the currency drops in this game fade pretty fast don't they
[4:55:44] <%dds333a> Just when you're out, you're back in
[4:55:47] <Djinnazz> @aWanderingKaivo depends
[4:56:00] <+skylerpilot> @hax_metatron the mozambique is the pistol shotgun from Apex Legends, unless they buffed it. It was considered the worst gun in the game for the short time I played. Most likely hes being sarcastic
[4:56:46] <rReizs> tf2 mozam went from a secondary to a primary
[4:57:28] <@Menitta> They added 6 bullets to the Mozam recently
[4:57:40] <%dds333a> more lore
[4:57:42] <@Menitta> The Mozam going to primary ruined that gun in Titanfall
[4:57:47] <laguerrilha> LUL
[4:57:53] <Rahvith> LUL
[4:57:57] <TWOxACROSS> maybe different language - you can sustain the zapping for a longer time, not charge it for a big zap
[4:57:59] <%andrewofbob> In Apex, it got an upgrade that doubles damage vs unshielded enemies, then they increased the mag from 3 to 4, then they removed the upgrade but increased the mag to 6
[4:58:01] <%LastHazzerd> i can't speak russian
[4:58:01] <laguerrilha> like how easy he can transition it
[4:58:05] <%dds333a> Squid3

[5:01:14] <%dds333a> Woolie is correct tho LUL
[5:01:21] <%andrewofbob> Returnal is bad for you if you have a gambling problem
[5:01:24] <laguerrilha> ye
[5:01:26] <Rahvith> Even if you spend money thats free damage

[5:06:49] <iacus_> a cthulhu
[5:06:53] <%dds333a> uh oh
[5:07:09] <@Menitta> the c u b e
[5:07:09] <+BigBruthaThunda> Kojima was like"...hallways are kinda scary" and the industry has never been the same since
[5:07:20] <Talen99> +900 Blood Echoes
[5:07:21] <%dds333a> Must tie into something
[5:07:22] <zzNamttamzz> This is fine

[5:07:29] <TWOxACROSS> "I got locked out..."

[5:07:44] <%LastHazzerd> Kiss the squid. kiss the Squid.
[5:07:47] <Johannen> PogChamp
[5:07:49] <+froduck42> reminds me of that burger king ad
[5:07:50] <Talen99> Oh my god it's the Beast Inside scare with a space man!
[5:08:03] <laguerrilha> nothing
[5:08:08] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> So wait... is it a kid, or a squid?
[5:08:08] <%andrewofbob> @BigBruthaThunda Hallways are scary; they represent a lack of choice; inevitability and powerlessness
[5:08:08] <@Menitta> @froduck42 what the fuck what ad
[5:08:15] <rReizs> amazing item
[5:08:15] <+aWanderingKaivo> an astronaut just standing there, menacing
[5:08:22] <zzNamttamzz> Astronaut PogChamp
[5:08:26] <heartlesshealer> :)
[5:08:31] <TWOxACROSS> such a great way to describe its function
[5:08:36] <+BigBruthaThunda> @andrewofbob WutFace
[5:08:37] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[5:08:40] <TWOxACROSS> "it will not let you go"
[5:08:54] <laguerrilha> never though an astronaut standing would be terrifying
[5:09:07] <Djinnazz> not if you're a badass MFer
[5:09:14] <+aWanderingKaivo> like a true teleporter should
[5:09:42] <%dds333a> "Where are you going? And where have you gone"
[5:09:59] <laguerrilha> yeah
[5:10:02] <Johannen> Its that Argo Boat Existential nightmare....thats focked up
[5:10:04] <zzNamttamzz> All of them if you are good
[5:10:08] <laguerrilha> Hades you can beat first run
[5:10:10] <+aWanderingKaivo> you can beat end boss in Hades first run
[5:10:11] <+aWanderingKaivo> yeah
[5:10:12] <rReizs> people did beat this on a fresh save
[5:10:16] <SkinnyRite> Do souls games count as rogues?
[5:10:18] <%dds333a> If you're THAT GOOD, yeah
[5:10:21] <Majestic_Flof> Isaac has a system at the end where you need like 4 items for the ending i think
[5:10:22] <%LastHazzerd> yeah Hades can do that
[5:10:35] <+toastybites> Depends on the game but I "beat" Risk of Rain 1 on the 1st try
[5:10:37] <%dds333a> You can beeline FTL Kappa
[5:10:40] <%Tearonex> People have beaten Hades and this game on the very first runs
[5:10:43] <+aWanderingKaivo> people speed run Hades, there's a dev commentary on one on yt
[5:10:52] <%jinking79> you'll only miss story stuff on first runs
[5:11:23] <+aWanderingKaivo> and Hades being Hades there's unique dialogue for going all the way through first run iirc
[5:11:52] <@Menitta> oh god those enemies are assholes
[5:12:10] <%dds333a> oh boy
[5:12:10] <+aWanderingKaivo> the puckering
[5:12:18] <%andrewofbob> No L
[5:12:22] <laguerrilha> Actually there is no dialogue change on the last boss if you do first run, its just the usual stuff
[5:12:42] <+aWanderingKaivo> oh no? thought there was
[5:12:47] <laguerrilha> on Hades
[5:12:48] <PMda2nd> money is pain
[5:13:11] <%dds333a> LUL
[5:13:13] <%DashXero> "He's giving me money."
[5:13:25] <PMda2nd> LUL
[5:13:48] <Djinnazz> fuck
[5:13:53] <Johannen> Leaving the item behind?
[5:14:06] <%andrewofbob> The item will hurt
[5:14:09] <@Menitta> he'd take damage from the malfunction
[5:14:09] <Djinnazz> or find locked chest somewhere
[5:14:11] <+aaymon86> Did they add an option to save?
[5:14:43] <Djinnazz> @aaymon86 no
[5:15:03] <TWOxACROSS> uuuh
[5:15:05] <TWOxACROSS> sometimes they do
[5:15:10] <lordrocca> Minh, Disengage the Safety Limiters on the Suit.
[5:15:19] <TWOxACROSS> but only like a handful of rooms with a few more enemies
[5:15:34] <+aaymon86> Goddamit man. That's the one thing holding me back from opening my copy cause I switch from game to game all the time.
[5:15:40] <TWOxACROSS> You can't go back to older zones
[5:15:40] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[5:15:58] <TWOxACROSS> Time to get disappointed!
[5:15:59] <Djinnazz> you can't do that
[5:16:41] <TWOxACROSS> Enjoy your extra like 10 HP :p
[5:16:45] <laguerrilha> it sucks all the dreams i had this part month are only nightmares
[5:16:56] <rReizs> time flies in this game
[5:17:00] <+aaymon86> It's a dumb design decision cause better rogue-likes have temporary saves.
[5:17:04] <drunken_lemur> Is this going to be a one-off?
[5:17:14] <TWOxACROSS> The super nerfed it
[5:17:19] <laguerrilha> yeah not having a logout save is dumb
[5:17:21] <TWOxACROSS> SUPER nerged it
[5:17:36] <Deasmeister> They nerfed it
[5:17:41] <%Lion_kun> super nerfed it used to be unlimited heal
[5:18:03] <%dds333a> @laguerrilha as someone who went through a period like that senior year of high school, I feel ya
[5:18:34] <lordrocca> The best healing is dodging.
[5:18:56] <%dds333a> @laguerrilha that's way in the past for me now, and I can't speak for ya really, but I'd like to say there's a light on the other side
[5:19:00] <rReizs> nightmares where you're back in school and have an assignment due
[5:19:04] <Deasmeister> nope healing isn't items
[5:19:20] <%andrewofbob> @lordrocca Best healing is don't get hurt in the first place
[5:19:41] <lordrocca> @lordrocca Indeed.
[5:20:06] <laguerrilha> @dds333a it doesnt really bring me down, its normally "well that really sucked" when i wake up
[5:20:21] <%RyTYoung> Who's on the sticks?
[5:20:27] <laguerrilha> Minh
[5:20:31] <he1lhydra> the mihn in the reggie cam looks so dramatic c805BuuHoo
[5:20:32] <gespenstkick> "It doesn't matter if you just don't get hit"
[5:20:39] <%dds333a> @laguerrilha I understand.
[5:20:40] <%andrewofbob> Transition to zone 3
[5:20:48] <%dds333a> @rytyoung Minh
[5:20:51] <Deasmeister> money
[5:21:05] <TWOxACROSS> it's really just those ones
[5:21:06] <%dds333a> money money
[5:21:17] <%dds333a> close NotLikeThis
[5:21:18] <TWOxACROSS> I haven't come across any other respawns but those dog guys i the first area
[5:21:27] <chambatron> They respawn now?
[5:21:35] <%RyTYoung> noice I'm sure I remember hearing Woolie telling us about his Returnal issues that he had
[5:21:47] <%RyTYoung> on the podcast
[5:21:57] <lordrocca> Heh
[5:21:58] <laguerrilha> HE stopped when the game bugged and lost his run
[5:22:11] <TWOxACROSS> new rooms can always have health pickups
[5:22:15] <%dds333a> Play with what you got Kappa
[5:22:16] <$eco419> Oof
[5:22:22] <TWOxACROSS> and enemies can drop 'em too
[5:22:26] <+aWanderingKaivo> in the olden times
[5:22:27] <he1lhydra> back in maaaa day
[5:22:29] <%RyTYoung> @laguerrilha I had that happen to me on a really good run too, all I need to do now is get the sun fragments
[5:22:31] <@Menitta> "Back in the day last week"
[5:22:32] <Tracazoid> In the before times
[5:22:34] <lordrocca> We live in an accelerated timeline. A few months indeed does feel like a few years.
[5:22:51] <+aWanderingKaivo> well that's silly
[5:22:51] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[5:23:12] <iacus_> Even real roguelikes let you save and quit
[5:23:16] <@Menitta> I'm confused. When you mean "save system" do you mean just run suspension?
[5:23:27] <%andrewofbob> Let the tentacles carry you up
[5:23:27] <chambatron> that's why I don't wanna play right now. I don't wanna lock 3 hours into a run
[5:23:35] <%dds333a> LAAGE
[5:23:38] <%RyTYoung> Anyone see the game trailer for Recompile for PS5? that looks pretty awesome
[5:23:39] <laguerrilha> A checkpoint so you can stop mid run and then continue
[5:23:44] <+aWanderingKaivo> that was a godsend pickup
[5:23:45] <Deasmeister> I feel that's an intentional design decision if they're not changing it which sucks
[5:23:49] <laguerrilha> @Menitta thats what he means
[5:23:54] <@Menitta> Ah ok
[5:24:28] <laguerrilha> @Deasmeister oh definetly, that isnt going to get changed even with complains
[5:24:49] <@Menitta> Yeah it feels intentional
[5:25:06] <@Menitta> but at the same time, I'm not sure what it adds

[5:25:09] <%RyTYoung> SWORD
[5:25:12] <TWOxACROSS> now time for PARRIES~
[5:25:12] <laguerrilha> oof the animation clipping
[5:25:13] <+aWanderingKaivo> SPACE katana
[5:25:15] <gespenstkick> Yamato time
[5:25:15] <whirly25> j e d i
[5:25:17] <@Menitta> oh no its not synced
[5:25:20] <Rahvith> Weeb Stick PogCHamp
[5:25:20] <%dds333a> Disappointment NotLikeThis
[5:25:22] <%andrewofbob> Anime go up
[5:25:27] <%dds333a> TITLE CARD
[5:25:27] <lordrocca> Oh most definitely.
[5:25:31] <laguerrilha> still didnt fixed the weapon getting animations
[5:25:35] <TWOxACROSS> those blue dogs are done now
[5:25:35] <%RyTYoung> Sword ONLY run begins NOW
[5:25:36] <Rahvith> Motivated af
[5:25:44] <+aWanderingKaivo> just one attack? attack chains later?
[5:25:45] <@Menitta> You can't really rely on melee builds but melee is FUCKING USEFUL
[5:25:54] <TWOxACROSS> Guess what, you can parry enemies and cut through bullets!
[5:25:56] <whirly25> bettel darmarge
[5:26:08] <%andrewofbob> @aWanderingKaivo Just the one on a short cooldown, but it chunks health and stagger
[5:26:15] <%dds333a> Cut em up
[5:26:25] <iacus_> You can only carry 1 weapon at a time?
[5:26:25] <%RyTYoung> I can't imagine actually pulling off a melee only run, that would be insane
[5:26:39] <%RyTYoung> one thing that I don't really like about Returnal is the cap on artifacts
[5:26:40] <@Menitta> It's doable but it's REAL hard
[5:26:40] <laguerrilha> @iacus_ yeah
[5:26:44] <%andrewofbob> @RyTYoung I don't think you can even melee the zone 3 bosses
[5:26:56] <TWOxACROSS> Not everything can be fought melee, no way
[5:27:00] <+skylerpilot> can't melee the 3rd boss
[5:27:09] <@Menitta> Actually no there's a point where unless you ignore fights you can't melee kill
[5:27:10] <chambatron> you can't beat the boss on Level 3 with melee
[5:27:15] <%RyTYoung> @andrewofbob I wouldn't have thought so since he's miles away LUL
[5:27:26] <@Menitta> Oh yeah that boss
[5:27:39] <+aWanderingKaivo> the WALL
[5:28:01] <%dds333a> Iconic marvel Villain, THE WALL
[5:28:01] <+skylerpilot> @RyTYoung you can totally get up close to him, and even into what should be melee range. You just can't hit him with it. Ive tried
[5:28:23] <iacus_> I head this game is like Risk of Rain but the progression works
[5:28:30] <@Menitta> LUL
[5:28:33] <%dds333a> HOLY SHIT
[5:28:40] <+fetrigon> bitch. made.
[5:28:42] <%dds333a> he's on your ass LUL LUL LUL
[5:28:42] <%Irridium> "Fuck that shit I'm out!
[5:28:46] <%RyTYoung> @skylerpilot it would be annoying fighting that way anyway since he knocks you back and resets the fight
[5:28:47] <rReizs> its not a horror game in combat lmao
[5:28:48] <@Menitta> [gets sword] "HELP"
[5:28:52] <+skylerpilot> Woolie would absolutely love the Loader from Risk of Rain 2.
[5:28:53] <%RealThiele> tactical RUN AWAYYYY
[5:28:54] <+aWanderingKaivo> honestly yeah that makes sense better to fight them in a chokepoint
[5:28:55] <%dds333a> The door LUL LUL
[5:28:55] <laguerrilha> ye
[5:28:59] <PMda2nd> I respect that decision lol
[5:29:03] <+aWanderingKaivo> than in a big open room where they can fly around you
[5:29:04] <@Menitta> OOOH GROUND SURGE
[5:29:12] <%RyTYoung> @skylerpilot the Loader is a GODSEND
[5:29:13] <@Menitta> That's the best item in the game imo
[5:29:20] <+aWanderingKaivo> tactical decision
[5:29:24] <laguerrilha> Oh yeah i wonder if Woolie would like Risk of Rain 2
[5:29:26] <+skylerpilot> I love Loader, favorite character easy
[5:29:26] <%RyTYoung> Merc is my personal favourite in RoR2
[5:29:32] <heartlesshealer> stack, reggie
[5:29:59] <+aWanderingKaivo> nonsense, TACTICAL decision
[5:29:59] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1417355334386061312?s=19
[5:30:00] <TWOxACROSS> also don't forget slashing in the air has some tracking
[5:30:04] <+fetrigon> LUL LUL LUL
[5:30:07] <heartlesshealer> it's fiiiiine
[5:30:18] <%RyTYoung> I would probably say Woolie would have more attraction to Merc due to big swoard air combos
[5:30:39] <rReizs> doom 3 vs doom 2016
[5:30:39] <+skylerpilot> nah Woolie loves swinging mechanics
[5:30:43] <%xcompleasedad> xcompleasedad subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months, currently on a 17 month streak! He get anything REALLY good yet?
[5:30:59] <%RyTYoung> @skylerpilot ya grappling hooks in games are super dope
[5:31:26] <TWOxACROSS> ground surge good
[5:31:31] <TWOxACROSS> if you just tap it it'll auto-lock
[5:31:40] <rReizs> if you just tap it hits the closest
[5:32:10] <+skylerpilot> Loaders grapple swinging and momentum based damage on her utility is 100% up Woolies ally
[5:32:12] <%RyTYoung> I only we got another stab at a bionic commando game NotLikeThis
[5:32:28] <zzNamttamzz> First try?
[5:32:32] <%dds333a> Rob 64
[5:32:42] <+skylerpilot> also Loader is a she, so shes a punch girl
[5:32:50] <%RealThiele> welcome to earf
[5:32:54] <@Menitta> lmao
[5:32:56] <gespenstkick> Dang, Woolie with the call outs
[5:33:03] <Johannen> Mihn standing on the back of giants
[5:33:04] <+fetrigon> oof
[5:33:05] <%RyTYoung> @skylerpilot :O no way that's awesome
[5:33:11] <%dds333a> woah
[5:33:16] <Mundkipz> are we doing bloodborne rules? handoff on death?
[5:33:50] <+aWanderingKaivo> I'm liking this boss tbh
[5:33:55] <%dds333a> @mundkipz Reggie kinda decides to hand it off, but nothing has been set
[5:34:31] <@Menitta> WOAH
[5:34:43] <%dds333a> Second Wind
[5:34:52] <Rahvith> ShoopDaWhoop
[5:35:01] <%perfectsalami> this looks nuts
[5:35:02] <%bread_assassin> Does astronaut figurine need to be recollected on the next run or will it always give =1 lives?
[5:35:13] <+fetrigon> good one
[5:35:15] <@Menitta> that was a good run
[5:35:16] <%bread_assassin> *+1
[5:35:17] <TWOxACROSS> @bread_assassin if you find one, you get one on-the-spot rez
[5:35:21] <heartlesshealer> good job
[5:35:21] <+skylerpilot> needs to be recollected
[5:35:40] <Deasmeister> That guy rocked my shit for a while
[5:35:45] <%dds333a> that boss design reminds me so much of something
[5:36:03] <%dds333a> It's the head
[5:36:06] <TWOxACROSS> no
[5:36:10] <+aWanderingKaivo> kind of reminds me of Nier a little bit just because of hurty ball projectiles in a third person game
[5:36:17] <TWOxACROSS> you won't get one from the house
[5:36:21] <TWOxACROSS> That was your freebie
[5:36:33] <TWOxACROSS> You can't enter the house unless you have a reason to
[5:36:35] <+fetrigon> good shit
[5:36:45] <%andrewofbob> Good stream
[5:36:51] <laguerrilha> good game, damn i hope they launch at PC
[5:36:53] <TWOxACROSS> nice work
[5:36:58] <TWOxACROSS> love the panicked screams haha
[5:37:04] <%livlinn> GGs woolieKICKDAD woolieMINHMAX
[5:37:04] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[5:37:05] <@Menitta> There's a part in Returnal that blew my fucking mind
[5:37:11] <bujiraso> Great game
[5:37:27] <TWOxACROSS> space spookums
[5:37:31] <@Menitta> It gets DAAAARK
[5:37:34] <@Menitta> story wise
[5:37:39] <%natedrago> damn did i come right at the end? lol
[5:38:00] <+aWanderingKaivo> or the run is shorter
[5:38:01] <rReizs> how many runs was it
[5:38:04] <%thatother1dude> thatother1dude subscribed with Prime. 
[5:38:15] <Johannen> Enter the Gungeon added a save option later in updates
[5:38:17] <@Menitta> The weapon types aren't super varied but later on, each weapon type gets more passive buffs
[5:38:18] <he1lhydra> the call of duty mindset, you WILL play this game and ONLY this game
[5:38:21] <%dds333a> You can just close it, and you're good
[5:38:25] <@Menitta> That's where the variety comes in
[5:38:27] <%dds333a> normally
[5:38:28] <%livlinn> OhMyDog
[5:38:32] <Prevot> suspend save
[5:38:36] <@Menitta> Theres just no run suspension
[5:38:38] <%andrewofbob> It needs to save the map and items
[5:38:39] <rReizs> at least returnal doesn't bloat the shit out of your hd
[5:38:53] <Johannen> Problem is not an absense of saves but the abusurd length of the RUN
[5:39:24] <TWOxACROSS> I've had two with drift so far :/
[5:39:31] <chambatron> Broooo that happened to my as well on my ps5 controller
[5:39:46] <TWOxACROSS> Warranty will still make you send it in, you paying shipping
[5:39:52] <%dds333a> Sacrificed on the altar of Returnal LUL
[5:39:53] <+aWanderingKaivo> ps5 controllers are having that problem? awesome
[5:39:57] <bujiraso> 1y?
[5:40:00] <%RealThiele> of all things the touchpad on our PS5 controller is going to shit already
[5:40:03] <%ekodrop> probably 1 year
[5:40:18] <stevenellis386> reminder to always get a warranty with these controllers going forward
[5:40:30] <+aWanderingKaivo> for real
[5:40:45] <%dds333a> That's piddly
[5:40:46] <chambatron> Overwatchsuck really bad with Drift
[5:41:00] <%ekodrop> drift is apparently covered
[5:41:18] <TWOxACROSS> Drift IS covered, but you have to pay for shipping :/
[5:41:21] <%dds333a> The most intensive game in that list is MAYBE DES
[5:41:25] <Johannen> Advance Rumble rummleded the heck outa those sticks)
[5:41:28] <laguerrilha> still will suck to have to pay shipping to them and get it back a month later
[5:41:30] <%livlinn> Try Contact spray, or qtip for emergency. Worked for me
[5:41:40] <@Menitta> I dont wanna be that "works for me" guy but I guess I've just been lucky, even with the Switch too
[5:41:42] <%RyTYoung> You know what sucks really bad with drift? trying to fight the final boss fight in Metal Gear Rising Revengeance NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[5:41:44] <chambatron> I wonder if the black and red controller have the same issue
[5:41:54] <@Menitta> I had 360 stick drift
[5:42:16] <%RyTYoung> 360 stick drift was the absolute worst
[5:42:20] <%dds333a> @menitta damn, your stick would just rotate uncontrollably Kappa
[5:42:31] <@Menitta> LUL
[5:42:37] <%livlinn> Drift in Animal Crossing is surprisingly VERY annoying woolieDATTEBAYO
[5:42:44] <%RyTYoung> @dds333a LUL
[5:42:54] <laguerrilha> Menitta going around round
[5:42:57] <TWOxACROSS> The one saving grace for not having mid-run saves is that you skip areas that you've already done, instead of going through them until you get to the end
[5:42:59] <@Menitta> But yeah I had a brand new 360 pad and it got drift almost immediately
[5:43:19] <@Menitta> oh god that was so stupid
[5:43:24] <+aWanderingKaivo> oh shit yeah
[5:43:28] <@Menitta> I can't believe that happened! HOW DID THAT HAPPEN
[5:43:29] <+aWanderingKaivo> that was AWESOME
[5:43:30] <%dds333a> oh boy
[5:43:44] <%RyTYoung> I must've went through about 8 Xbox 360 controllers, from halo odst to halo reach limited edition ones it was awful
[5:43:46] <%dds333a> LUL
[5:43:48] <%livlinn> OhMyDog
[5:43:50] <%cobalt_phoenix_> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis woolieONEGUY

[5:44:10] <rReizs> BUFF MY TANK you biased fucks
[5:44:11] <%Bin_VV> A W is still a W
[5:44:11] <+0dinpen> He MUST win
[5:44:17] <iacus_> The important thing is, if the dude he was arguing against conceded the argument
[5:44:20] <gespenstkick> That's commitment
[5:44:24] <+glassesaregod> We ABSOLUTELY take those
[5:44:25] <rosemon5001> he will get 1 year of no tea at most
[5:44:25] <%livlinn> Heated gamer moments huh woolieMIRIN
[5:44:36] <%dds333a> He probably didn't even win, the other guy just ignored it LUL
[5:44:37] <laguerrilha> Man the devs of the game must have had a laugh at that
[5:45:01] <%dds333a> Almost LITERAL Navy Seal Copypasta
[5:45:51] <bujiraso> Lol
