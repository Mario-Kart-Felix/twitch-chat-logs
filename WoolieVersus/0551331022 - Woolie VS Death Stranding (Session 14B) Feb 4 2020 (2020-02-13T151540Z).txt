[0:10:10] <exglebster> so the game keeps forcing you to keep running around just so that everyone would not die?
[0:10:11] <%mrhandsss> if you constantly give him his meds, he survives
[0:10:18] <%Irridium> I think you can keep him alive if you keep delivering to him
[0:10:18] <Raztron> you have complete control woolie

[0:16:51] <peachy996> Give us rocks
[0:16:52] <%mrhandsss> RIP BOOMER
[0:16:53] <%jiggy_snipe> Woolie trying to justify old man murder Kappa
[0:16:56] <$laphyrion> Then who are YOU to Dead Elder shame pepole with a dead Elder in YOUR save file? ;B
[0:16:57] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Just blame it on Konrad, like all your problems, Woolie Kappa
[0:16:58] <Cykron> Yeah Pat spared him
[0:17:08] <+Mendin> What's the undertale quote? "You think you are above consequences?"
[0:17:11] <%Prevot> crazy world where Pat is a better person than Woolie. I don't like it.
[0:17:11] <derap41> Pat didn't kill him Woolie
[0:17:18] <%Solidnick18> i didn't know
[0:17:19] <%Exiliator> DId pat really save him?
[0:17:22] <samuraijakanddaxter> schrodinger's elder, if i dont go see him then he hasnt died
[0:17:25] <Camail> elder% no glitches
[0:17:27] <+kyh9> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli lol
[0:17:33] <Sartastic> some people must've not murdered him
[0:17:47] <%solzan2000> 100%
[0:17:48] <Cykron> Imagine someone killing the Elder
[0:17:48] <+Ancopro> pat didn't 5 stared tho
[0:17:57] <peachy996> As long as you know you killed him
[0:18:03] <zenith0111> Elder can die?
[0:18:06] <%mrhandsss> we startin up proper naow? if we going to cryptobiotes, still a lot of stuff to do!
[0:18:08] <%Superbro64> I aint drinking your back wash woolie, jesus DansGame
[0:18:10] <+PenmanLupine> Pat definitley killed him
[0:18:15] <+Mkingston> @WoolieVersus Are we in a Boomer Killing Cult now?
[0:18:17] <samuraijakanddaxter> woolie killed a guy
[0:18:20] <jeffthesequel> Who knew part 9's villain would be a streamer? LUL
[0:18:22] <zenith0111> Weird I did clean up at this chapter and never encountered that
[0:18:24] <%jinking79> down it with some Monster Energy Drinks
[0:18:34] <+Premium_Heart> sam jackson voice: I'm glad he's dead I hope he burns in hell!
[0:18:34] <MyNameIsRasus> Remember that time Woolie killed that old guy
[0:18:38] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Dont put this on me, WALKER
[0:18:38] <derap41> nd we have killed him. How shall we comfort ourselves, the murderers of all murderers? What was holiest and mightiest of all that the world has yet owned has bled to death under Woolies knive
[0:18:38] <+Razor4145> all you woolie
[0:18:41] <%Exiliator> CLIP IT
[0:18:44] <Camail> remember when woolie denied killing the elder
[0:18:47] <%Exiliator> OUT OF CONTEXT
[0:18:47] <%GeneralSCPatton> We all neglected the elderly, together
[0:18:51] <peachy996> Rationalize
[0:18:52] <MyNameIsRasus> Woolie about Elder: "I NEED HIM DEAD"
[0:18:57] <Cykron> You too, Chewie?
[0:19:01] <+Jaysky> You killed my father, prepare to die.
[0:19:02] <+slunkymcgee> Does this mean chat is an accessory to murder?
[0:19:03] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Woolie: KILL FUCKING CONFIRMED
[0:19:06] <samuraijakanddaxter> time to bust down his shelter down and blast him with a hematic rocket launcher
[0:19:11] <@Solidus_113> now it's time to go
[0:19:15] <+PenmanLupine> the porter life is forever
[0:19:17] <+D00msDayDan> Guys I‚Äôm not sure I like War Crimes Woolie
[0:19:18] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> LUL
[0:19:19] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[0:19:21] <%jiggy_snipe> LUL
[0:19:23] <%The_Timo> Lol as of Kojima had anything to do with that.
[0:19:29] <peachy996> Woolie "5 Star the Elderly, then ditch their ass" Madden
[0:19:31] <Shishi1205> The irony, pat calling woolie wrong on Twitter LUL
[0:19:40] <+linSP> gotta kill the old mans ghost now
[0:19:44] <derap41> woolieDATTEBAYO_BW too real
[0:19:46] <+kyh9> S-Rank the Elderly, get your candy, and get the fuck out
[0:19:49] <+kyh9> Just like rael life
[0:19:55] <zenith0111> If it's lame blame Kojima and if it's cool give Kojima NO CRDIT
[0:19:56] <Cykron> Yeah this is the 33rd‚Äôs fault
[0:20:05] <@SoushinSen> ADAMS, SHOOT THAT MOTHERFUCKER WHO IS ON THE HOLOGRAM IN FRONT OF YOU BUT NOT THE GUY NEXT TO HIM HOLDING A GUN, JUST THE CIVILIAN ONLY. DO IT NOW
[0:20:15] <Zayasu> cant wait for the granblue streams Kreygasm
[0:20:18] <derap41> Just glad this game has subtitles cause I can't hear shit
[0:20:26] <@SoushinSen> Yes sir
[0:20:30] <%thechungiestofbois> Konrad killed the elder
[0:20:40] <%thechungiestofbois> FoNT FUCK IT UP
[0:20:40] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:20:50] <@Solidus_113> Void out happens when a BT eats the body
[0:20:50] <samuraijakanddaxter> cant BTs go through walls and stuff?
[0:21:00] <%mrhandsss> safe as long as nobody goes into the bunker and gets eaten
[0:21:09] <zenith0111> Not really
[0:21:09] <samuraijakanddaxter> dead bodies dont equal void out
[0:21:13] <Shishi1205> Voidouts need someone alive
[0:21:14] <%jiggy_snipe> yea I'm pretty sure BTs can go through walls and touch bodies
[0:21:18] <+Mkingston> Die under a pile of coats
[0:21:21] <+Ancopro> the elder lit himself on fire before going out
[0:21:21] <Tuna_Can_0> they'd need to hug an alive person
[0:21:21] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> dead bodies are just a BT magnet
[0:21:24] <spooksy> death = new bt, caught by bt and eaten by big guy = voidout
[0:21:29] <samuraijakanddaxter> a living person being eaten causes voidout
[0:21:30] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> but you need a live person to void out
[0:21:31] <+Mendin> A Life-Alert/Death-Alert
[0:21:31] <MyNameIsRasus> As long as no one goes there it's fine
[0:21:33] <Shishi1205> That's why in the first mission of the game the dude tries to kill himself
[0:21:41] <Cykron> Void outs are caused by the living coming into contact with a BT
[0:21:42] <%The_Timo> Well no then you wouldn't have had to do the corpse run in the first section of the game
[0:21:43] <%jiggy_snipe> oh ok
[0:21:49] <samuraijakanddaxter> because that makes a BT
[0:21:50] <%mrhandsss> killing people creates BTs
[0:21:50] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> because it causes a BT warzone
[0:21:51] <worldbrand> ???
[0:21:52] <zenith0111> NotLikeThis
[0:21:53] <samuraijakanddaxter> that can eat a living person
[0:21:54] <redrins> killing someone creates BTs
[0:21:55] <Shishi1205> BTS
[0:21:59] <+Mkingston> Prep Shelters are insulated with piles of coats.
[0:22:00] <redrins> we went over this last time
[0:22:01] <+Ancopro> no its to avoid DRAWING BTs
[0:22:02] <worldbrand> But then the body becomes a BT
[0:22:03] <Camail> human matter + bt matter = boom
[0:22:03] <DingusMcBaseball> BT as in bullet
[0:22:05] <derap41> Its at the moment of death not the corpse
[0:22:06] <MyNameIsRasus> Killing someone makes BTs
[0:22:09] <%mrhandsss> dead body = BT 48 hours later
[0:22:09] <Shishi1205> if they go necro BT appears
[0:22:11] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> dead bodies attract a BT
[0:22:12] <samuraijakanddaxter> if you make a BT they will eat a living person
[0:22:12] <iosephe> Yes
[0:22:13] <+Ancopro> yes
[0:22:14] <Tuna_Can_0> yes
[0:22:15] <Cykron> It‚Äôs to avoid more BTs
[0:22:15] <spooksy> killing makes bts and by definition a bt is a void out risk
[0:22:15] <MyNameIsRasus> YES
[0:22:16] <%thechungiestofbois> Thanks Reggie
[0:22:17] <%Irridium> eats you or anyone else
[0:22:18] <worldbrand> Reggie's got it
[0:22:24] <Cykron> You don‚Äôt want to make more
[0:22:25] <%GeneralSCPatton> Incinerating bodies increases chiral concentrations and contributes to timefall
[0:22:29] <+linSP> dead body = bt which leads to voidout
[0:22:31] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @zenith0111
[0:22:32] <Cykron> Yes
[0:22:32] <+JacknZack27> Killing someone makes a bt. A bt eating a live human makes a voidout
[0:22:33] <Shishi1205> That's why in the first mission of the game the dude tries to kill himself
[0:22:33] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> in the email it says that an alive person plus BT is like an antimatter and matter touching each other
[0:22:34] <+Damie904> Killing someone makes a BT, BT killing people make voidout
[0:22:36] <Tuna_Can_0> could get hugged by a bt for science
[0:22:36] <MyNameIsRasus> It is fucking weird to be fair
[0:22:36] <%Solidnick18> BT's are all the dead civies woolie killed in spec ops
[0:22:38] <%mrhandsss> voidout = antimatter in a BT coming into contact with matter (of a living body)
[0:22:40] <+agumon9000> Its why the guy who got caught tried too kill himself
[0:22:41] <spooksy> dude woolie it's very unclear. everyone thought death = voidout pretty much
[0:22:43] <+Ancopro> thats why at the opeining that dude glasses the other dude before getting eaten
[0:22:48] <GarbageNirvana> To be fair that opening cutscene with Higgs doesn't make it super clear
[0:22:49] <+D00msDayDan> He finally got there boys
[0:22:51] <%thechungiestofbois> WE DONT WANT MORE GHOSTS
[0:22:57] <Rosswelle> in the long, LONG run, it essentially minimizes voidout risk
[0:23:00] <%Irridium> if a mule dies and goes BT, there's other BT's in the area still. And if one of those guys gets eaten, Voidout
[0:23:03] <+D00msDayDan> He finally figured out how voidouts work
[0:23:03] <TheSphereHunter> dead bodies go necro, become BTs, that BT eats another human - void out
[0:23:06] <+linSP> dont get us started on gold bt's
[0:23:11] <+kyh9> And BT's cause void outs because life + anti-life is like matter+anti-matter
[0:23:19] <Camail> the bt accessed the chiral projector in some way
[0:23:21] <Camail> which is weird
[0:23:23] <+Ancopro> but noone will ever go there anywhere cause its been 5 starred so shrug
[0:23:24] <MyNameIsRasus> Probably can't get too far from the body
[0:23:25] <%Irridium> they can crawl on all kinds of stuff but can't go *through* things I think
[0:23:43] <Shishi1205> what a funny looking icon
[0:23:44] <@Solidus_113> LOOK AT THAT KEY
[0:23:46] <worldbrand> Does that mean they could send in a blood exorcism team with like fire hoses of sam's blood
[0:23:47] <@Solidus_113> THINK
[0:23:48] <Tuna_Can_0> those preppers walking about could cause voidouts too if theyre dumb enough
[0:23:51] <samuraijakanddaxter> throw it in a pit
[0:23:54] <MyNameIsRasus> LOOK AT KEY
[0:23:55] <iosephe> It almost looks like....
[0:23:55] <+linSP> ü§î
[0:23:56] <+Ancopro> hMMM
[0:23:57] <derap41> @kyh9 the explosions form that would be bigger than Tsar bomba
[0:23:59] <%Prevot> monkaS
[0:23:59] <MyNameIsRasus> HMMMM
[0:24:00] <Pappajimbo> himm
[0:24:00] <%Solidnick18> what's that
[0:24:02] <%Solidnick18> hmmmmmmmmm
[0:24:03] <sendart> LUL
[0:24:04] <%Irridium> huh looks kinda familiar interesting
[0:24:04] <worldbrand> who's that pokemon
[0:24:05] <@Solidus_113> you can offload it and get a better look
[0:24:06] <%Irridium> hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
[0:24:07] <Cykron> One crawled through a small piece of broken window at the furnace
[0:24:07] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> HGMMMMMMMMMMMMM
[0:24:08] <Shishi1205> Hmm
[0:24:10] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> I WONDER
[0:24:13] <Shishi1205> what could that be
[0:24:13] <%The_Timo> Seems legit, time to deliver
[0:24:15] <samuraijakanddaxter> oh wait i didnt even look at the fuckin key in my game
[0:24:15] <spooksy> doin a big think
[0:24:24] <Rosswelle> @WoolieVersus you should hold it in your hand to examine it more hmmmmmm
[0:24:31] <Tuna_Can_0> don't think just do 4Head
[0:24:35] <+agumon9000> Future Keys
[0:24:46] <+linSP> TOOLS
[0:24:51] <+Ancopro> Not my bb
[0:24:57] <samuraijakanddaxter> i need to have my tools
[0:25:07] <Cykron> THATS A LOTTA BLOOD
[0:25:14] <%The_Timo> Stock up on Anti BT stuff. need lotsa blood lol
[0:25:14] <Cykron> YOU WANT FRIES WITH THAT
[0:25:14] <Pappajimbo> take some ladders
[0:25:21] <%mrhandsss> pretty optimized. SOME PEOPLE (radbrad) never learned how to customize backpacks
[0:25:27] <Shishi1205> PAt never used it
[0:25:29] <zenith0111> @samuraijakanddaxter It highlights in a cutscene NotLikeThis
[0:25:30] <samuraijakanddaxter> never used the sticky gun once
[0:25:37] <Raztron> its for casuals
[0:25:38] <+Ancopro> i love sticky gun
[0:25:38] <%The_Timo> I used that like CRAZY lol, Sneak and Yoink lol
[0:25:38] <+Mkingston> Spider-Man gun
[0:25:42] <%Irridium> sticky gun's great
[0:25:45] <@Solidus_113> you need some blood weapons
[0:25:48] <@SoushinSen> Never used it either, once i saw they damage the cargo i snatched.
[0:25:50] <%mrhandsss> i used it only to get packages out of those pits with the gas in them
[0:25:54] <Raztron> this is a hiking delivery game
[0:25:58] <Shishi1205> get the guns
[0:25:58] <Rosswelle> @WoolieVersus incase you arent aware, cause i just noticed your legs. the power exo is the only one that prevents you from putting cargo on your hips
[0:26:05] <samuraijakanddaxter> this is a shooter now
[0:26:06] <Raztron> go walk to it like a Chad
[0:26:08] <Tuna_Can_0> does the sticky gun damage cargo if you time your catches?
[0:26:11] <Cykron> Get guns
[0:26:31] <%mrhandsss> they're good for now
[0:26:32] <%Irridium> @This_is_Marco nope if you catch it as it brings it to you there's no damage
[0:26:37] <Tuna_Can_0> I missed somewhat often LUL
[0:27:11] <zenith0111> But you do know what you're carrying NotLikeThis
[0:27:12] <%GeneralSCPatton> Cheer500 Incinerating bodies will increase chiral concentrations and contribute to timefall, at least lore-wise if not in game mechanics. So killing and burning isn't exactly a freebie.
[0:27:14] <%GeneralSCPatton> GeneralSCPatton's Cheer shared rewards to 10 others in Chat!
[0:27:29] <Mothman742> sipsipDab
[0:27:29] <samuraijakanddaxter> you can easily kill every non boss BT with cord cutter now tbh, use no blood too
[0:28:29] <+Mendin> Thanks for the LuvBrownL @generalscpatton
[0:28:29] <derap41> Anyone catch Noah Caldwell-Gervais review of Death Stranding ?
[0:28:29] <+Mkingston> @WoolieVersus Just watched a Canadian Fallout sketch. How bad is Artificial Maple?
[0:28:30] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1224743712657412096?s=19
[0:28:36] <Raztron> that blood gun didnt seem that useful
[0:28:42] <+Ancopro> unboxing
[0:28:43] <zenith0111> @derap41 Who?
[0:28:51] <%mrhandsss> a lot of stuff built right outside the city in his game. kinda jealous lul
[0:28:54] <Shishi1205> did you try the grenade launchers? @WoolieVersus
[0:28:58] <%Solidnick18> i saw they added that you can skip the bt encounter scene
[0:29:03] <Raztron> more useful to have a shit load of hematic grenade and rifles
[0:29:10] <spooksy> yeah cause its in the order you pick up
[0:29:11] <Rosswelle> if you pick up a weapon in the field with your hand, you can actually select it in the weapon wheel too, and itll just pop the case right then
[0:29:12] <+ORGANizerC> is woolie ready to sit down for the next 8 or so hours
[0:29:12] <Raztron> grenade launcher is better too
[0:29:16] <+Ancopro> this bb is a keykey
[0:29:25] <+Jasuchin> All this to go help someone set up their WiFi?
[0:29:33] <derap41> @zenith0111 Guy that does High detailed literal analyses of games he did one about Death Stranding and brought up a bit about what woolie felt with the elder
[0:29:34] <Tuna_Can_0> @Raztron KKona amen
[0:29:38] <+bread_assassin> Thanks for the LuvSnooze @generalscpatton
[0:29:38] <+linSP> i need my internet man
[0:29:42] <TheSphereHunter> Did you turn off the scanner animation?
[0:29:43] <+Mkingston> FOG DOOR
[0:29:44] <%mrhandsss> oh. you aint seen nothin yet
[0:29:50] <zenith0111> @derap41 What's High?
[0:29:51] <Shishi1205> higgs is a trip
[0:29:52] <MyNameIsRasus> I gotta say, it's pretty fucking dope seeing Woolie way better at the game compared to those beggining sessions
[0:30:01] <samuraijakanddaxter> higgs is alright
[0:30:04] <AceOne5> nope
[0:30:08] <peachy996> He loves a little bit of the licky face
[0:30:11] <%Lion_kun> Nope
[0:30:13] <%mrhandsss> higgs is a pretty great villain. i wanna see troy play this on retro replay some day
[0:30:16] <derap41> @zenith0111 highly sorry
[0:30:18] <%Prevot> this is the taste of a porter
[0:30:23] <nothuzad> kefka?
[0:30:24] <+firmlygraspi1> no one's a fan of evil with better motivations than the protag :)
[0:30:27] <Shishi1205> Dio?
[0:30:29] <%Irridium> @WoolieVersus pro-tip in the main menu they added an option to turn that odradek scene off
[0:30:30] <AMaidIndeed> Culprit?
[0:30:32] <nothuzad> dio?
[0:30:32] <Ropcord> sheev
[0:30:37] <MyNameIsRasus> He probably means culprit
[0:30:41] <peachy996> They're fun archetypes I disagree
[0:30:43] <+Jasuchin> Kurgan from Highlander was awesome for Evil fot the sake of Evil
[0:30:46] <%azeDevs> Moral ambiguity ScaredyCat azpngEr
[0:30:49] <+Mkingston> BLOODBOURNE REFERENCE
[0:30:50] <Rosswelle> @WoolieVersus youre on the right track at least. you might like the coming loredump
[0:30:53] <@Solidus_113> remember these from that one place south of the Timefall Farm?
[0:30:54] <+Javaa01> Yeah, PS3 games used the shoulder buttons because the triggers were atrocious
[0:30:55] <Shishi1205> Oh yeah
[0:30:55] <peachy996> Hey maybe sometimes people are assholes
[0:31:00] <%Solidnick18> New type

[0:31:04] <+Ancopro> metroids
[0:31:05] <Tuna_Can_0> R1 is so much better for shooting anyway
[0:31:05] <zenith0111> @derap41 Oh okay. I just came in so idk how Woolie feels about the Elder
[0:31:06] <Zayasu> bloodborne PogChamp
[0:31:06] <%The_Timo> BT ALIENS
[0:31:07] <+Mendin> grant us eyes
[0:31:07] <%GeneralSCPatton> Time evil, where you just have to let them win and the bad stuff they did will never happen, is great
[0:31:07] <%Sparkseid> yup
[0:31:07] <Graxe_> New BTs
[0:31:08] <derap41> Shoghots
[0:31:08] <redrins> they're BACK
[0:31:10] <Shishi1205> We saw this ones
[0:31:11] <%Prevot> woolie has muscle memory from all those innocents he killed
[0:31:13] <Graxe_> Oh no
[0:31:15] <+firmlygraspi1> THE BIG BRAIN AM BACK
[0:31:16] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> SHOOT
[0:31:20] <%The_Timo> it's coming
[0:31:21] <samuraijakanddaxter> woolie seen these guys before i thought.... or was that pat's stream
[0:31:23] <%Solidnick18> shoot
[0:31:25] <%Prevot> mars people?
[0:31:26] <%mrhandsss> technically, you could've run into these before. they're where the city that got nuked was
[0:31:26] <%GeneralSCPatton> This shit you can find on the coast!
[0:31:27] <+Mkingston> Fog gate followed by these things
[0:31:27] <+bread_assassin> These are actually in the central map, too.
[0:31:28] <%Solidnick18> they go pop
[0:31:29] <Graxe_> That thing popped
[0:31:30] <Shishi1205> pop
[0:31:31] <%The_Timo> Just needs a few shots to pop
[0:31:32] <iosephe> don't worry about it
[0:31:33] <derap41> those are 100% shoggoths
[0:31:34] <+Jasuchin> Eq
[0:31:35] <zenith0111> You guys could've encountered them on the 2nd map in a certain location
[0:31:36] <+Jasuchin> Ew
[0:31:37] <%jinking79> fuck those things
[0:31:38] <Raztron> they;re in a creator going around the mountiains
[0:31:40] <+linSP> OH AMYGDALA
[0:31:45] <%solzan2000> oh this part was sick
[0:31:47] <Raztron> you can see them in a distance
[0:31:48] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> we bloodborne now
[0:31:53] <%solzan2000> looks awesome
[0:31:53] <Shishi1205> Do they even do anything
[0:31:54] <peachy996> Jellies
[0:31:56] <MyNameIsRasus> Fear the old goo
[0:31:57] <+Mkingston> You a Hunter now
[0:32:03] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> the fun part is you can see this in the open world if you look hard enough
[0:32:04] <Raztron> they pretty disappointing
[0:32:10] <samuraijakanddaxter> they can be ran past
[0:32:11] <+Mkingston> Just run
[0:32:12] <Dingo_Eejit> yeah, 'balloon things'
[0:32:13] <%GeneralSCPatton> They're fully visible at all times, so are they really BTs?
[0:32:14] <%Prevot> THE BALOON
[0:32:14] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> theyre near beaches in the open world
[0:32:15] <Rosswelle> what was the balloon minigame in mgs peace walker called?
[0:32:16] <MyNameIsRasus> @Mkingston YOU CAN SMILE AGAIN
[0:32:16] <Raztron> though they be more horrific
[0:32:16] <derap41> Wish there where more eldrich like stuff
[0:32:16] <%Solidnick18> they work to
[0:32:18] <AceOne5> you can run
[0:32:19] <%Solidnick18> yeah
[0:32:20] <%Prevot> GOTTA GET THE BALLOON
[0:32:25] <%Sparkseid> I think they're super gross
[0:32:27] <zenith0111> Shoggoths are a million times grosser and huger
[0:32:30] <Graxe_> The fact that they pop means they exist physically
[0:32:30] <+linSP> dont tell him what they are
[0:32:32] <samuraijakanddaxter> they pop and hurt you a little
[0:32:39] <+Mkingston> Where's Gasquoin?
[0:32:39] <Shishi1205> you can outrun them
[0:32:40] <zenith0111> This is just some slimeball in comparison
[0:32:41] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> did they ever explain thisor did i miss an email
[0:32:43] <Graxe_> And not just some weird BT ghost thing
[0:32:46] <samuraijakanddaxter> but theyre slow and not very aggresive
[0:32:56] <Tucker0603> do normal bullets kill em?
[0:32:57] <derap41> @zenith0111 eh depends on who descibes them
[0:32:59] <MyNameIsRasus> You know Woolie, some do say Kosm
[0:33:11] <zenith0111> @derap41 Hp lovecraft LUL
[0:33:13] <%jiggy_snipe> What are these balloon things? Was it ever explained?
[0:33:20] <%Prevot> I hope they grab you and float you to your death like that balloon pokemon
[0:33:21] <peachy996> If you kill all of them you get the Milkweed Rune
[0:33:22] <Raztron> the Tar
[0:33:32] <Raztron> just floating around
[0:33:34] <derap41> @zenith0111 well yeah but outside of that they've kinda a generic monster these days
[0:33:41] <AceOne5> move quickly
[0:33:42] <%ECRead> they're tar bubbles yeah
[0:33:45] <Raztron> so they're a physical manifistation
[0:33:48] <spooksy> you can find these guys early if you go way out on a beach somewhere
[0:33:54] <Rosswelle> these balloons are part of the death stranding pooyan mission minigame LUL
[0:33:54] <samuraijakanddaxter> theyre pretty chill
[0:33:55] <%Solidnick18> i just shot them all
[0:33:58] <zenith0111> @derap41 Which is why I hate most stories that try to emulate him nowadays
[0:34:04] <+Mkingston> Can fertilized turn into BTs?
[0:34:05] <zenith0111> Fuck stephen king
[0:34:17] <peachy996> Never be safe, always risk
[0:34:27] <MyNameIsRasus> Make sure to eat the umbilical chord yo uget out of this
[0:34:33] <samuraijakanddaxter> yh theyre on a beach near the timefall farm, and kind of behind the craftsman too
[0:34:36] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @firmlygraspi1
[0:34:41] <+Master_Quincey> this section really shows off how much of the game is rendered at a time
[0:34:42] <Mothman742> BT jellyfishes
[0:34:48] <peachy996> Floating Portugese Manowars
[0:35:08] <zenith0111> I think they're BT germs
[0:35:12] <derap41> @zenith0111 can't do Lovecraftian horror these days its hard describing indescribable stuff it all becomes mundane
[0:35:12] <samuraijakanddaxter> theyre fully visible at all times
[0:35:15] <Rosswelle> @WoolieVersus its because these are actual physical entities
[0:35:21] <+Master_Quincey> or how far it can keep enemies on the map at least
[0:35:23] <Shishi1205> not bts
[0:35:26] <zenith0111> Like since celluar life is still life so this is the form they took from the beach
[0:35:29] <Raztron> its the next stage of the Beach Tar stuff
[0:35:31] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:35:37] <Graxe_> Might be able to use normal bullets maybe?
[0:35:43] <Graxe_> Since they exist physically
[0:35:47] <+Master_Quincey> BT Pimples Kappa
[0:35:57] <Raztron> since its not regular Tar, part of the Death Stranding proccess
[0:35:57] <samuraijakanddaxter> damn i didnt kill any of these things i just ran past
[0:35:58] <%The_Timo> Floating WOMBS!
[0:36:02] <samuraijakanddaxter> woolie is going full genocide
[0:36:04] <%Solidnick18> becarful here
[0:36:06] <+bread_assassin> So what's the lore of these things?
[0:36:11] <zenith0111> @derap41 Yep most writers have no idea what made him so great.
[0:36:11] <derap41> Anti matter squids thingies
[0:36:28] <+Mkingston> Is this Bubble Bobble now?
[0:36:31] <%Solidnick18> gotta drop
[0:36:37] <derap41> @zenith0111 mainly the moment in time that he was writing the books
[0:36:37] <peachy996> I remember Pat running into those offstream and on this section I'm like what, how'd you know about these?
[0:36:43] <%mrhandsss> aim for the bushes
[0:36:47] <%Solidnick18> watch as he goesssssss
[0:36:54] <%The_Timo> Don't miss that mem stick lol
[0:36:58] <+firmlygraspi1> There goes my villain with superior motivation!
[0:36:59] <+Razor4145> here we see woolies mind goblins in action
[0:37:02] <+Mkingston> rope
[0:37:07] <%Solidnick18> oh
[0:37:07] <+linSP> youll see where these come from in a bit
[0:37:08] <Rosswelle> please look for a safe way down from this building NotLikeThis
[0:37:10] <%Irridium> you know you could rope down right
[0:37:13] <%Solidnick18> yeah
[0:37:25] <Raztron> why did people kept referring to them as strange lights
[0:37:32] <zenith0111> @derap41 Hp Lovecrafts style was hardly about the concepts and more of how he talked about them. Little to no dialogue, recollection of past events and observation in a panicked rush
[0:37:32] <Raztron> its just memory sticks
[0:37:35] <+Mkingston> Main mechanic:forgotten
[0:37:35] <lewdiversal> OWL2019Junkrat
[0:37:39] <@Solidus_113> remember R3 to swap shoulders
[0:37:47] <samuraijakanddaxter> do a flip
[0:38:01] <%mrhandsss> just go. 1 of them alone hardly hurts you
[0:38:02] <%The_Timo> You chose the worst possible place to go down lol
[0:38:03] <%GeneralSCPatton> @peachy996 I told him where to find these. Took many donations and the fact I'm a trusted fan for him to go so far out of the way.
[0:38:14] <MyNameIsRasus> Just Helter Skelter it
[0:38:28] <zenith0111> People think old god = HP and that's far from the truth
[0:38:31] <+linSP> sam, remember to do a flip before jumping off an edge
[0:38:48] <Tuna_Can_0> WutFace
[0:38:48] <Shishi1205> it did squirt
[0:38:51] <derap41> @zenith0111 wasn't really talking about concept more about the surrounding culture that made his books what they where
[0:38:51] <peachy996> @GeneralSCPatton Yeah I heard you can run into them earlier
[0:38:56] <Rosswelle> it popped
[0:38:58] <%thechungiestofbois> This reminds me of ‚Äúspeed‚Äù from the bloodborne lp
[0:39:05] <Shishi1205> not hit by it tho
[0:39:09] <+Javaa01> It popped under the floor, because they detonate based on proximity
[0:39:14] <lewdiversal> got baby nutted on Kappa
[0:39:15] <+Javaa01> But it didn't actually hit you
[0:39:18] <+Ancopro> I'm pretty sure you can see them if you travel past the timefall farm
[0:39:18] <@Solidus_113> that's just the timefall effect on cargo
[0:39:23] <zenith0111> @derap41 You where? Odd phrasing
[0:39:31] <%mrhandsss> easily
[0:39:32] <%thechungiestofbois> Yes
[0:39:40] <+Mkingston> @sjay449 Well, this section did start with a BB reference
[0:39:48] <%thechungiestofbois> These things aren‚Äôt a problem if it‚Äôs just one
[0:39:53] <Shishi1205> those are some likes
[0:39:59] <derap41> @zenith0111 Yeah maybe a twitch chat isn't the best place to have a impromptu book club
[0:40:12] <+linSP> b a b y n u t
[0:40:18] <%mrhandsss> they took off the otter hood :(
[0:40:37] <zenith0111> @derap41 Agreed? Alright
[0:40:50] <%Prevot> please don't bring up babynut in this BB filled game
[0:40:57] <derap41> Oh is this the part where they ruin the most oppressive figure in this game
[0:41:00] <%Irridium> BBnut
[0:41:19] <lewdiversal> 2Bnut
[0:41:22] <%thechungiestofbois> BBnutted all over deadman
[0:41:34] <samuraijakanddaxter> BB is a antifa super soldier
[0:41:43] <Mothman742> CEASE
[0:41:44] <zenith0111> I love how Pat didn't understand anything when he got to the end
[0:41:48] <Mothman742> wooliePOYO
[0:41:51] <%Prevot> "Sam, this is Babynutman."
[0:42:05] <peachy996> @zenith0111 he understood one thing
[0:42:16] <samuraijakanddaxter> this is the fuck zone
[0:42:17] <peachy996> Amelie is worst girl
[0:42:20] <Raztron> you monster woolie
[0:42:23] <%Exiliator> Welcome to "Fucked city"
[0:42:23] <Riorii> yeah pat hated the ending, it was hillarious haha
[0:42:26] <Raztron> look how much pain your causing
[0:42:31] <%Irridium> welcome to Fuck Knot city
[0:42:32] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:42:32] <Riorii> especially since so many love it
[0:42:33] <%mrhandsss> SHOOT THE BABY
[0:42:36] <Raztron> when you have a stealth option
[0:42:39] <%The_Timo> Lol I didn't like the ending because I called ALL of it in the first few hours lol
[0:42:42] <zenith0111> Pat doesn't understand charater motivation LUL
[0:42:42] <%solzan2000> poor baby
[0:42:43] <%Solidnick18> Shoot that baby
[0:42:46] <derap41> The ruined cities and Ghost bt remind me of that original CGI final fantasy movie
[0:42:49] <pirateofpie> Well, Pat hated one certain segment of the ending
[0:42:49] <%thechungiestofbois> Pat hated one part but f the 3 part ending
[0:42:51] <%Exiliator> Shoot the baby
[0:42:51] <Ultimatefool> Snipe the ghost baby
[0:42:52] <samuraijakanddaxter> kick the baby
[0:42:52] <@Solidus_113> Baby Nut erased
[0:42:55] <Tisaric> I'm really surprised how many people were still confused at the end, especially bunnyhop
[0:42:57] <+Piemen99> fuck dem kid
[0:43:00] <Graxe_> BT Baby Nut
[0:43:01] <OldManDeckardCain> woolie popping all the baby nuts Kappa
[0:43:02] <Mothman742> He didn't hate the ending just amelies rambling
[0:43:07] <Rosswelle> @derap41 i actually have that movie. spirits within, right?
[0:43:09] <kulmoth> turned upside down man
[0:43:11] <peachy996> Pat liked True ending, hated Amelie and I can agree
[0:43:12] <Cykron> The old overseer of this place was Choke Jerkman
[0:43:13] <Riorii> @The_Timo i actually really liked that they didnt hide that stuff like other games do
[0:43:13] <+locutus_of_the_porg> baby nut charlsMURDER
[0:43:21] <zenith0111> The story is really simple once you know all the pieces
[0:43:30] <derap41> @Rosswelle yeah seen it lately? is it worth rewatching?
[0:43:30] <peachy996> But we'll get there in time
[0:43:31] <zenith0111> It's like super straight forward
[0:43:33] <lewdiversal> ^
[0:43:35] <Raztron> Sneak woolie
[0:43:46] <%thechungiestofbois> Kill that bbnut in the womb
[0:43:48] <%Solidnick18> littlecloser maybe
[0:43:48] <Rosswelle> @derap41 i have not, but part of me still cringes at the thought of it
[0:43:50] <+linSP> i mean i get it but the ending had "Ok kojoomer" vibes
[0:43:51] <Riorii> so is the plan to finish this today?
[0:43:55] <samuraijakanddaxter> woolies gonna get snatched up
[0:43:57] <%mrhandsss> no
[0:44:07] <derap41> @Rosswelle I might risk it later just for fun
[0:44:10] <peachy996> @Riorii Split between today and thursday
[0:44:19] <%The_Timo> @Riorii Yeah but a lot of it was just.. obvious. not gonna say spoilers lol.
[0:44:23] <Riorii> makes sence, thanks!
[0:44:33] <zenith0111> If DS did a cool thing give Kojima no credit and when it messes up blame Koji. Win win for the cynic
[0:44:37] <+linSP> honestly never saw some get caught here
[0:44:39] <%GeneralSCPatton> @linsp OK Kojamborino
[0:44:52] <Cykron> ‚ÄúJerkman, this is Baby Nutman‚Äù
[0:44:54] <Rosswelle> @derap41 i remember it being not necessarily bad, but also not great
[0:44:54] <%mrhandsss> better actually be thursday and not tomorrow. i dont wanna miss it and not get to hear one of the songs
[0:45:03] <%mrhandsss> unless twitch stopped flagging that ONE song
[0:45:04] <%The_Timo> Yeah Through this area I just did all sneak kills
[0:45:19] <derap41> @Rosswelle same don't remember hating it
[0:45:21] <Raztron> like a decent person
[0:45:23] <%Solidnick18> so good
[0:45:26] <Raztron> get those BT likes
[0:45:29] <zenith0111> If the ending was anything I think the story would fall apart
[0:45:38] <vVAstrAVv> that aot intro was fing weird
[0:45:46] <Pappajimbo> fighting crows
[0:45:58] <%mrhandsss> meh u could run it
[0:46:02] <Shishi1205> you can skip those now?
[0:46:06] <+NotHereToStream> you can
[0:46:06] <Mothman742> Anyone wanna guess what the new LP is gonna be? I'm betting arkham asylum
[0:46:07] <%mrhandsss> i think so
[0:46:10] <+Mkingston> Not far. Just walk thorough the valley of death.
[0:46:15] <Graxe_> Oh no, speed skeleton
[0:46:24] <+Javaa01> You can disable those extended animations in the settings, but not skip them mid gameplay
[0:46:33] <derap41> @Mothman742 Just cause not sure which one though
[0:46:33] <Cykron> I walk through the valley where I harvest my grain
[0:46:33] <%Solidnick18> few bt's
[0:46:35] <peachy996> @Mothman742 We'll never get Arkham Asylum
[0:46:37] <%Prevot> arkham asylum would be a good ass LP choice
[0:46:38] <+locutus_of_the_porg> just Sprint with speed Skelly level 3
[0:46:38] <QaizerArt> You can turn off that animation of 'YO THERE'S BTS' now in options @WoolieVersus
[0:46:40] <samuraijakanddaxter> i snekd all of these guys then popped the last cluster with a rocket launcher because i hand tused it yet
[0:46:42] <+Omegaanimus> BT's hailing from Death...Valley
[0:46:43] <PlumpPotatoRump> Yo guys, whats up? o/
[0:46:44] <MyNameIsRasus> The best part about AOT is how many spoilers the mananged to fit into that third ending that get uncovered as the manga advances
[0:46:44] <%mrhandsss> no sense delaying the inevitable
[0:46:45] <peachy996> Woolie REFUSES to play
[0:46:50] <%Solidnick18> just cut their cords
[0:46:57] <zenith0111> If they play Batman I'm not watching ResidentSleeper
[0:47:03] <spooksy> wait woolie HASN'T PLAYED ARKHAM ASYLUM???
[0:47:06] <Mothman742> Who cares
[0:47:12] <Raztron> I hope woolie continues with the shooter games
[0:47:12] <%thechungiestofbois> Arkham asylum is the smash ultimate fisticuffs. We‚Äôll never get it
[0:47:13] <derap41> @zenith0111 to formulaic`?
[0:47:21] <%Solidnick18> lol
[0:47:23] <+Mkingston> @spooksy nope
[0:47:24] <+NotHereToStream> 1 baby
[0:47:28] <zenith0111> @derap41 Not a good LP game
[0:47:34] <MyNameIsRasus> 1 baby 1 nut
[0:47:35] <%mrhandsss> obviously not someone american
[0:47:38] <%thechungiestofbois> Woolie vs gmod
[0:47:42] <OldManDeckardCain> one man, one guy, and one baby nut
[0:47:43] <+Omegaanimus> I believe Arkham has been referred to as "Those games Woolie should love but won't play"
[0:47:44] <Cykron> Pat recommends it often and Woolie just sandbags
[0:47:48] <+Mkingston> @zenith0111 yes it is
[0:47:48] <peachy996> I can see that
[0:48:00] <zenith0111> @mkingston For me
[0:48:06] <phatmac16> We close to the end?
[0:48:07] <+CheyMix> robaatYeah
[0:48:08] <derap41> @zenith0111 WItcher 3? I'd be fun to watch woolie skrew that up
[0:48:09] <Graxe_> The Platinum 4 website updated
[0:48:12] <Raztron> you use it for the Monsters woolie
[0:48:17] <@Solidus_113> cut that baby cord
[0:48:17] <Graxe_> Shows four separate projects
[0:48:18] <peachy996> Well you're basically watching someone play Arkham but poorly and slow
[0:48:19] <spooksy> you're telling me he HASNT seen DEATH NOTE?
[0:48:21] <MyNameIsRasus> All problems in life are a direct consequence of not enough G U N
[0:48:23] <Cykron> Baby and Gun, just for fun
[0:48:24] <Raztron> not the suffering Human KA
[0:48:27] <zenith0111> @derap41 I love that TV Show Kappa
[0:48:28] <Graxe_> W101 Remastered is the first of the four
[0:48:29] <peachy996> I could see that not being fun for some
[0:48:32] <+firmlygraspi1> Arkham City gave us the best Harley Quinn outfit, so I'm grateful
[0:48:33] <%Solidnick18> Go to heaven baby
[0:48:47] <%thechungiestofbois> Sam ‚ÄúBust a cap in this ghosts ass‚Äù Bridges
[0:48:48] <+Omegaanimus> When will a game have the bravery to give us a baby gun, like the Fallout mod?
[0:48:48] <lewdiversal> w101, bayo3, Babylon
[0:48:48] <Mothman742> Tbh I would be SOOO down for a anarchy reigns lp

[0:52:08] <zenith0111> @derap41 Witcher 3s combat is super easy and only serves to throw you into cutscenes as fast as possible. Hence it's more like a telltale movie/show than a game at times.

[1:07:07] <Tucker0603> LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL
[1:07:11] <derap41> I need guns...lots of guns
[1:07:14] <+Mkingston> Now we Armoured Core
[1:07:18] <Raztron> isnt armor plates only for Bullets?
[1:07:28] <Raztron> i dont think they help with anything else
[1:07:42] <Djinnazz> Get rid of speed
[1:07:42] <Rosswelle> @Raztron i think it slightly helps with general impact protection. i could be wrong
[1:07:44] <derap41> @Raztron can he keep guns there?
[1:07:44] <+UnpronounceableName> LUL
[1:07:50] <%Solidnick18> they do
[1:07:53] <Tucker0603> @woolieversus remember the grenade and normal bullet trick
[1:07:55] <samuraijakanddaxter> i never used the armour plates
[1:07:55] <%Irridium> put on the speed skeleton at least that's a free slot
[1:08:00] <Raztron> more grenades on the shoulderss with out the plates
[1:08:03] <+therabbles> the most powerful delivery man on the planet
[1:08:06] <zenith0111> Awe he didn't equip the better rocket launcher :(
[1:08:07] <+Javaa01> You can do more if you hook up that power skeleton
[1:08:10] <%mrhandsss> could've settled for quad quad launchers but u had to go for 5 didnt ya?
[1:08:14] <+Mkingston> Think of all the boomers you can kill with all those rocket launchers.
[1:08:20] <zenith0111> But my multi-rockets :(
[1:08:21] <+Proxzo> You didn't put on your skeleton
[1:08:24] <@Solidus_113> remember to auto arrange
[1:08:29] <+Ancopro> shoot the blood rocket through the blood cloud
[1:08:36] <samuraijakanddaxter> equip skeleton
[1:08:45] <Raztron> speed skeleton bro
[1:08:46] <BearSawed> Sam heard some bois were stealing amazon packages and he wiches them punk ass bitches make a move
[1:08:47] <%GeneralSCPatton> EQUIP SKELETON
[1:08:51] <%Solidnick18> get that fresh blood
[1:08:51] <Raztron> always
[1:08:56] <derap41> Sam big topheavy
[1:08:58] <Tuna_Can_0> grenade launcher was my fav its so satisfying
[1:09:04] <zenith0111> All I have to say is I can't believe this wasn't the final boss
[1:09:16] <Graxe_> 6*4 rockets
[1:09:16] <%Irridium> get an all-terrain level 3
[1:09:22] <Graxe_> That's a lot of rockets
[1:09:22] <Rosswelle> @WoolieVersus protip: you wont need armor plates for whats coming up, so you could use that space for grenades or other useful weapons
[1:09:22] <derap41> @zenith0111 honestly this boss totally ruined BTs
[1:09:38] <+Javaa01> You can't use leg plates and a skeleton at the same time, so just go for the skeleton so you can carry more launchers
[1:09:42] <BearSawed> The boss was the strands we tied along the way
[1:09:43] <+therabbles> Imagine you get a delivery from a guy carrying like 5 rocket launchers
[1:09:44] <%mrhandsss> this buildup is some serious anime pacing
[1:09:49] <zenith0111> @derap41 Why?
[1:09:56] <+Mkingston> Speed run
[1:09:57] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus remember you can't put stuff on your legs because of the power skeleton
[1:10:08] <zenith0111> @derap41 Never mind I want to know after the do this sequence
[1:10:09] <derap41> Went from being these ominous mysterious creatures to just a puppet pawn
[1:10:13] <samuraijakanddaxter> ditch the plates
[1:10:27] <zenith0111> @derap41 I honestly assumed that's what it was from the beginning
[1:10:29] <%Irridium> but you can use the speed or all terrain
[1:10:35] <%Irridium> those let you keep your leg slots
[1:10:35] <Raztron> ye ye all terrain is good
[1:10:41] <%The_Timo> Armor won't help here

[1:12:54] <samuraijakanddaxter> i took out one of those rocket launchers
[1:13:04] <derap41> fucking Higgs would be fun as a minor vilian but he fucks with the main threat
[1:13:08] <BearSawed> Cant wait for the megacut of inventory management when this series ends
[1:13:25] <zenith0111> @derap41 Did you want it to the big baddy? This faceless emotionless thing?
[1:13:25] <Ether101_Prime> Woolie really needs to know about Lorgar.

[1:14:19] <derap41> @zenith0111 I didn't want a main baddy I wanted a natural force without conviction or a face something that is simply occuring not a laughing jackass
[1:14:19] <%Exiliator> Maybe one more beer
[1:14:23] <BearSawed> Bitch better have my money
[1:14:29] <TheSphereHunter> I can't wait to see that whole stack of launchers fall at first hit

[1:20:43] <+linSP> big boom
[1:20:43] <%Exiliator> It sounds like the majoras mask giants
[1:20:47] <Graxe_> Do you like your rockets now
[1:20:49] <%Prevot> monkaS
[1:20:49] <Raztron> Shoot the Gold part
[1:20:50] <+Premium_Heart> zzzzzzzz
[1:20:51] <derap41> Hit the "fuck me" spots
[1:20:57] <%solzan2000> lol
[1:21:00] <@Solidus_113> Drop weapons once they're empty
[1:21:02] <Shishi1205> shoot at the gold
[1:21:02] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> its DOOMS DAY BABY
[1:21:04] <+linSP> hitting amelie is nightmare fuel
[1:21:05] <derap41> ....he hang dong though
[1:21:12] <dero45> Where can u go
[1:21:13] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @jorniev
[1:21:16] <%Exiliator> Now go up to it and punch it LUL
[1:21:17] <Tucker0603> @woolieversus shoot higgs in his stupid face
[1:21:18] <%Solidnick18> Oh look a weak point
[1:21:31] <+TossuDa> evo19Death
[1:21:34] <+therabbles> what a video game boss
[1:21:47] <Raztron> But he Doesnt Play VideoGames!
[1:21:47] <%Solidnick18> WTF
[1:21:52] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> I really love how much of a videogame boss Higgs is
[1:21:53] <Raztron> Why!
[1:21:58] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Right down to his character
[1:22:03] <dero45> It‚Äôs poopin
[1:22:08] <Raztron> Wasn that part of his backstory kojima!
[1:22:09] <%Prevot> Higgs should be called Bossman
[1:22:09] <%The_Timo> When he starts that, shooting 1 will cascade and destroy them all
[1:22:12] <RicoSabroso> My goodness D:
[1:22:12] <zenith0111> This boss fight is a lot of fun
[1:22:25] <Sedrelic> those things remind me of that drowing frog game
[1:22:33] <+linSP> shoot those placentas
[1:22:39] <derap41> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli Is it really worth having the all of this ruined just to Higgs can wink at fart at the camera
[1:22:39] <+Premium_Heart> is this like an intentionally shitty game like deadly premonition
[1:22:44] <%Solidnick18> the multi lock rocket does alot to him
[1:22:45] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> HIggs is basically just there because gamers would cry because the game doesnt play out like a videogame, so HERES ALL THE VIDEOGAME YOU WANT
[1:22:54] <+Mkingston> Metal Gear Ray fight
[1:22:56] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Ruin Higgs?
[1:23:00] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Sure whatever Higgs is great
[1:23:02] <%Solidnick18> oh jeez
[1:23:07] <jorniev> metal gear!?
[1:23:11] <+Ryu_R> I don't think kojima cares what people say about his weird video game art piece tbh
[1:23:12] <dero45> ahhh why did I expose myself
[1:23:17] <zenith0111> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli That's an over stipulation
[1:23:17] <BurdRightsActivist> @heartbbyy It's making a game for exactly one type of person, while not shit, most people aren't going to like it. I'm still wondering who the fuck this game's made for
[1:23:19] <+BionoidLCR> ok i wasnt sure if woolie know abou the help thing
[1:23:22] <Raztron> it would work better if Higss actually played those playstations you deliver
[1:23:25] <+Mendin> In the words of Gene Godhand: "Finally! A boss fight!"
[1:23:29] <Raztron> but its not mentioned at all
[1:23:33] <derap41> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli you've watched Noah Caldwell-Gervais
[1:23:35] <dero45> Guess he likes the view lol
[1:23:41] <Raztron> it could of worked better with that extra layer
[1:23:43] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @derap41 who?
[1:23:48] <derap41> dammit
[1:23:51] <%solzan2000> its mande for people that will like it

[1:24:17] <@Solidus_113> guide your shots
[1:24:17] <samuraijakanddaxter> i randomly died and repatriated just before killin this boss, couldnt tell if it was supposed to happen or not
[1:24:19] <+Mkingston> Woolie's just aiming for God
[1:24:20] <+Premium_Heart> noah can only beat games on easy, the ultimate game journalist
[1:24:25] <%Superbro64> use your gamer skills woolie
[1:24:26] <+BionoidLCR> you dont have to lead hes just aiming at the edge of the shoulder and missing lol

[1:24:48] <RicoSabroso> atpLaw atpRtsd1 atpRtsd2 atpLaw2
[1:24:49] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @derap41 but thats what this is, whether it worked for you or not, its not that subtle
[1:24:51] <MSN04_Sazabi> What happened with Kojima and bossfights after 4? Like he forgot how to make them
[1:24:55] <zenith0111> Woolie VS The Inevitable!
[1:25:01] <Camail> think he moved
[1:25:08] <zenith0111> The Eldrich Truth?
[1:25:11] <Raztron> oh no!
[1:25:22] <Tuna_Can_0> No backseating Higgs
[1:25:22] <@Solidus_113> remember to drop empty bloodbags too
[1:25:31] <+Premium_Heart> the sorrow is a non-boss fight too and its still pretty cool unlike this
[1:25:39] <derap41> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli yeah but it completly ruined the suspense and mystery of what BT are look at this shit
[1:25:39] <dadeaner> bad angle stream
[1:25:43] <+BionoidLCR> walks right into it FailFish
[1:25:58] <zenith0111> @heartbbyy Exactly. Sorrow wasn't a boss fight Kappa
[1:26:00] <+Ryu_R> the sorrow fight sucks if you kill people
[1:26:02] <gunsrlove> KNEES WEEK
[1:26:06] <gunsrlove> WEAK*
[1:26:12] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @derap41 what are BTs? They were never more than tar ghosts while the special ones being giant monsters
[1:26:16] <%Swedish_Expert> this bossfight sucks but i like how claustrophobic the arena is
[1:26:19] <Midnight188> is this the final boss?
[1:26:24] <%mrhandsss> no
[1:26:24] <+Omegaanimus> visually it's impressive, but that seems to be the only purpose
[1:26:28] <%The_Timo> @Midnight188 no
[1:26:31] <samuraijakanddaxter> you can more or less ignore the blobs
[1:26:31] <Pappajimbo> no he moved
[1:26:32] <%Solidnick18> SAAAAM
[1:26:35] <%thechungiestofbois> It is not
[1:26:36] <+Caped_Eggy> LUL woolie
[1:26:37] <+BionoidLCR> no hes not lol
[1:26:40] <Tucker0603> he moved
[1:26:44] <Raztron> @Midnight188 Nope
[1:26:46] <Shishi1205> you can clearly see him on the chest
[1:26:49] <RicoSabroso> he need sum MILK
[1:26:50] <+JacknZack27> Hes super not
[1:26:51] <samuraijakanddaxter> right hip
[1:26:53] <+BionoidLCR> FailFish
[1:26:53] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[1:26:54] <Shishi1205> Like long ago
[1:26:55] <Tuna_Can_0> shoot her again LUL
[1:26:57] <zenith0111> LUL
[1:26:57] <+Taglog7> LUL
[1:26:58] <Camail> WOOLIE
[1:27:00] <%Sparkseid> LUL LUL LUL
[1:27:02] <Raztron> Its fine Reggie lol
[1:27:03] <gunsrlove> Konrad shot Amelie
[1:27:04] <%The_Timo> Also hitting the red areas does less damage
[1:27:07] <derap41> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli and now they're a manifestation of a collection of chiral crystals under the control of Higgs
[1:27:09] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Honestly just aiming for the head is the easiest since that weakpoint never changes
[1:27:11] <Raztron> LUL
[1:27:14] <derap41> I prefer not knowing
[1:27:16] <bevyrage> isn't amelie on the chest, and partical man on the back right now?
[1:27:16] <dadeaner> No not the Civiies
[1:27:23] <+Premium_Heart> this is like that shitty sequence in the naruto ultimate storm 3 game where you fight the statue
[1:27:24] <zenith0111> CHIRAL GHOSTS
[1:27:37] <Camail> the finger hands are creepy
[1:27:42] <MyNameIsRasus> This fight would be way easier with White Phosphorous
[1:27:54] <+Omegaanimus> fingers are creepy in general when you think about it
[1:27:57] <zenith0111> @heartbbyy Totally equivalent to mashing one button
[1:27:59] <Raztron> i love the ghost sams
[1:28:00] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @derap41 i have to dance around some bits but they were always just tools to kickstart the extinction.
[1:28:07] <Pappajimbo> eat bugs
[1:28:08] <Graxe_> Another rocket launcher
[1:28:13] <Raztron> they stop the gold BTs
[1:28:15] <Graxe_> Thanks ghosts
[1:28:16] <zenith0111> BTs were always a symptom not the cause
[1:28:23] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[1:28:26] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> EASY MODE
[1:28:26] <@Solidus_113> go easy mode
[1:28:26] <+Caped_Eggy> LUL
[1:28:29] <zenith0111> So making BTs the focus would ruin the narrative
[1:28:29] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> YOU WANT EASY MODE WOOLIE
[1:28:30] <+Chronobot> Higgs has unlocked Easy mode
[1:28:31] <Raztron> Ye Zenith got it right
[1:28:31] <derap41> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli and that kinda ruins them
[1:28:33] <+BionoidLCR> equip the gun....
[1:28:33] <+Loyks> just tank it, its not even worth it
[1:28:34] <MyNameIsRasus> EASY MODE IS NOW-
[1:28:39] <+linSP> gold ghosts are an instant game over right
[1:28:40] <Graxe_> Higgs suggests easy mode
[1:28:47] <Ricobana> helpers just throwing items alongside this grand boss battle is how you know its kojima
[1:28:55] <Raztron> yes if they drag you, game over
[1:28:57] <peachy996> Boss must be real happy it's doing so well against you
[1:29:01] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @derap41 I mean thats pretty much your expectations of what they should be vs what they always were. I cant really do anything about that
[1:29:05] <samuraijakanddaxter> oh wow i never got grabbed by the gold guys
[1:29:25] <%mrhandsss> just power through its almost ded
[1:29:30] <+linSP> gold guys only appear if you revisit a cratered area, or in boss fights
[1:29:42] <peachy996> nice shot
[1:29:48] <derap41> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli point being this moment of turning these tool into a weak boss battle weakens their "horror" moving forward
[1:29:48] <Camail> in the strenum LUL
[1:29:49] <Raztron> pro tip: shoot it until it dies
[1:29:51] <Raztron> seriously
[1:30:04] <%mrhandsss> if gold guys grab you, its instant death
[1:30:04] <%The_Timo> Don't stop shooting, Amelie is invincible lol
[1:30:08] <Tuna_Can_0> just shoot it 4Head
[1:30:30] <RicoSabroso> yea 4Head
[1:30:31] <%Prevot> woolie is only good at shooting without thinking if the target is innocent LUL
[1:30:34] <MyNameIsRasus> Woolie you have to hit him
[1:30:36] <BurdRightsActivist> just shoot 4Head
[1:30:39] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @derap41 but by this point you dont really fear BTs, hell at the middle point you dont since youve been given so many counter combats against them. Why should this change anything?
[1:30:52] <+Mkingston> @linSP I never had 1 void out in my playthrough and came across 1 gold BT in the mountains.
[1:30:52] <%The_Timo> Just shoot lol
[1:30:55] <Camail> he's above amelie's right shoulder
[1:30:56] <+Omegaanimus> Woolie just think of it as a mass of ghosts of civilians
[1:31:01] <@Solidus_113> shoot the dick
[1:31:02] <+Mkingston> Just fucking shoot it
[1:31:03] <ALTRNico> just shoot amelie
[1:31:04] <Graxe_> Higgs is like right in the middle of the chest where the sternum is
[1:31:08] <Raztron> they straight up tell you BTs are mostly just humans
[1:31:12] <%The_Timo> SHOOT EVERYWHERE, Amelie takes no damage
[1:31:13] <+Ryu_R> you can shoot amelie this boss isn't complex
[1:31:18] <%Frubblord> just shoot
[1:31:20] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> does Shooting Amelia even do anything
[1:31:22] <Raztron> which is why they give you the knife
[1:31:25] <GarbageNirvana> Guys
[1:31:26] <%Solidnick18> just shoot man
[1:31:27] <%The_Timo> Reggie is making this take forever lol
[1:31:31] <zenith0111> @derap41 That's because Kojimas whole purpose was to give you something that appears to be unexplainable just for us to rationalize it and realise the power we have. Sure things my seem crazy and unavoidable but research and a community we can power through it :)
[1:31:31] <MyNameIsRasus> Amelie is invulnerable
[1:31:33] <derap41> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli No not mechanically I'm talking thematically within the story of the game they're still some mysterious half understood entity
[1:31:47] <vVAstrAVv> i thiiiink i shot milie and it was fine? she canonically cant die im pretty sure
[1:31:48] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1224743712657412096?s=19
[1:31:56] <Tucker0603> fuck it, shot her
[1:31:56] <ALTRNico> it's fine just shoot Amelie too
[1:31:57] <Graxe_> I think he's just taunting you about hitting Amelie
[1:31:58] <OldManDeckardCain> just unload on your sister's chest Kappa
[1:32:01] <%Sparkseid> there's not
[1:32:06] <GarbageNirvana> So there's just no fuckin mods about at all huh
[1:32:07] <peachy996> To be fair, Not shooting in the Amelie Spot is a reasonable thing
[1:32:19] <+linSP> shooting amelie makes her screaminf head appear on the giant bt iirc
[1:32:21] <@Solidus_113> almost
[1:32:23] <Raztron> ye ye
[1:32:28] <ALTRNico> why
[1:32:28] <MyNameIsRasus> Unload your baby nut on your sister. Just like Pat
[1:32:30] <ALTRNico> just end him
[1:32:33] <vVAstrAVv> like i couldn't tell who was in the weakpots anyways so fuck it lol
[1:32:34] <zenith0111> @garbagenirvana Tbf I had to block like 2 of them
[1:32:35] <@Solidus_113> yaaaay
[1:32:37] <%Solidnick18> he's done
[1:32:39] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @derap41 i mean thematically the thousands of emails and encounters have already told you what they are.
[1:32:41] <%Solidnick18> Gg
[1:32:42] <+Omegaanimus> I recall this boss growing her head and face
[1:32:42] <Raztron> now the interesting part lol

[1:33:18] <+Ancopro> so much chiral
[1:33:19] <Rosswelle> @derap41 what entity, BTs? it was my understanding a BT is effectively a ghost. the soul of a person bound to the living world by some force or reason
[1:33:19] <+BionoidLCR> HANDS
[1:33:20] <Midnight188> Round Two?

[1:33:37] <dero45> blindwDab
[1:33:38] <peachy996> How come he didn't get the Amelie head? Did he damage it to hard and too fast

[1:33:42] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> NO

[1:33:47] <@Solidus_113> CHIRAL WALL
[1:33:48] <%wydamn> Now cue the 15 minutes it takes to pick it all up
[1:33:50] <+Javaa01> To keep the BTs out
[1:33:53] <+Jasuchin> Crying so much from the emotion in this game that it drowns the planet!
[1:33:55] <BurdRightsActivist> GIANT GOLD WALL
[1:34:00] <+Mendin> We'll build a wall, and make the BT's pay for it!
[1:34:00] <zenith0111> BUILD THAT CHIRAL WALL
[1:34:01] <MyNameIsRasus> We'll make the BTs pay for it
[1:34:02] <+Omegaanimus> In all fairness Kojima is the insane logical conclusion to Japan's weird love of puns
[1:34:03] <%Sparkseid> keeps EVERYONE out
[1:34:06] <OldManDeckardCain> DAMN BT'S AND THEIR DRUGS
[1:34:06] <+Ryu_R> gotta keep those bad BT hombres out
[1:34:07] <+Mkingston> Chiral wall. hands across America.
[1:34:08] <+heyitsdenzel_> maybe if they had some rope
[1:34:13] <Graxe_> Die-Hardman is even the client
[1:34:15] <+Razputin217> and HIGGS IS PAYING FOR IT
[1:34:18] <ALTRNico> make the BTs build your wall
[1:34:20] <+pedrothecruel> THERE CHIRAL IN THEM HILLS!
[1:34:23] <katocrimson> we'll make the BTs pay for it
[1:34:28] <BurdRightsActivist> A porter has fallen into the river outside south knot city
[1:34:35] <OldManDeckardCain> tbf, building walls worked pretty well in history LUL

[1:34:46] <%Solidnick18> Keep the bt's out
[1:34:47] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @derap41 the Ha and Ka early on, then them actually using it later as terms pretty much made me change how I look at the emails and interviews. Its less of a "were not sure" and more of a "this is kind of what they are but well guise it as an email"
[1:34:49] <derap41> What a shit Higgs is
[1:34:51] <MyNameIsRasus> GRIFFISU
[1:34:57] <Djinnazz> A wall no 8 year old can climb

[1:40:17] <jorniev> that baby parried those bullets real good!
[1:40:19] <+heyitsdenzel_> That game of life is hard to play I'm gonna lose it anyway The losing card of some delay
[1:40:19] <+drfaustisdead> Woolie's baby contempt is showing.
[1:40:21] <+Jasuchin> And I can take or leave it if I please~
[1:40:24] <peachy996> You can take it or leave it if you please
[1:40:26] <zenith0111> NICE
[1:40:35] <Rosswelle> that casing is basically made out of 7 layers of compressed, pressurized bulletproof glass
[1:40:39] <peachy996> I remember the Marilyn Manson cover to it
[1:40:45] <peachy996> Very different tone
[1:40:46] <+Omegaanimus> wait was it for the show or movie???
[1:41:02] <+Javaa01> And also because getting your kid to do it solves a lot of legal nonsense
[1:41:03] <derap41> Don't you get a minigun here?
[1:41:04] <ALTRNico> it's not like you can bring it with you on the main map
[1:41:07] <bevyrage> @Omegaanimus the movie had the lyrics to the intro
[1:41:14] <@chesterr01> @solidus_113 point of no return is soon?
[1:41:14] <bevyrage> show did not
[1:41:18] <Rosswelle> @derap41 sadly there is no minigun
[1:41:20] <vVAstrAVv> progress iirc
[1:41:22] <%mrhandsss> lul no
[1:41:23] <@Solidus_113> You've got a bit longer
[1:41:23] <MyNameIsRasus> it's blud
[1:41:24] <%ChoculaUltra> hey, does Granblue Versus drop everywhere this Thurs or is it just the JP release?

[1:41:36] <+Omegaanimus> Man...people have really forgotten about that movie
[1:41:36] <redrins> @ChoculaUltra japan
[1:41:39] <%mrhandsss> the point of no return they were told is still awhile away at the rate they've been going
[1:41:44] <alrobot2014> @ChoculaUltra na release is march
[1:41:45] <%ChoculaUltra> @redrins thanks, slime
[1:41:46] <taptapmuhgap> Blood is liquid human battery
[1:41:49] <OldManDeckardCain> @ChoculaUltra Hong Kong version has eng subs
[1:41:50] <+drfaustisdead> "Walking around with that much blood, there's no downside." - Woolie 2020
[1:41:58] <+Omegaanimus> blood is cheaper than printer ink
[1:41:58] <+D00msDayDan> God imagine if he spent another half hour organizing his inventory for what comes next
[1:42:08] <+Omegaanimus> printing organs is cheaper than printing documents
[1:42:08] <@Solidus_113> How do you get to the beach to fight Higgs? woolieSMUG
[1:42:15] <%ChoculaUltra> @OldManDeckardCain oooo, might have to cop an early copy
[1:42:32] <+linSP> another puzzle
[1:42:34] <MyNameIsRasus> Big IQ time
[1:42:35] <%mrhandsss> lets see if they find out
[1:42:45] <taptapmuhgap> Higgs is going to be dangerous on the beach. He will have time to....shore up his defenses :DDDDDDDDDD
[1:42:48] <MyNameIsRasus> I hope Woolie watches Rick and Morty
[1:42:53] <Malikwest11> bring one real one woolie
[1:43:14] <@chesterr01> @taptapmuhgap üëç
[1:43:19] <zenith0111> @omegaanimus Because blood is everywhere when ink is not
[1:43:21] <pirateofpie> I can't wait until they get to that one part in the Higgs fight
[1:43:21] <Malikwest11> ...echo
[1:43:30] <ALTRNico> look at all this planning woolieSMUG
[1:43:42] <samuraijakanddaxter> I figured out this bit by complete mistake, was just trying to go back n do clean up
[1:44:07] <+Omegaanimus> that's why blood is great
[1:44:11] <%derrickslays> but reggie, you're my role model
[1:44:21] <+Mkingston> Good night everyone

[1:44:43] <Tucker0603> @chesterr01 Lou, the youngest of the royal guard. parrying before even being born
[1:44:46] <taptapmuhgap> Higgs is really making waves with this beach plan of his
[1:44:46] <BurdRightsActivist> Persona 5 WutFace
[1:44:50] <Malikwest11> oh it's just the app
[1:44:54] <+Omegaanimus> I'm not saying people have kids for the event of needing blood or an organ but I bet it's a nice comfort to have
[1:44:56] <Tuna_Can_0> @Mkingston night!
[1:45:01] <Nested_Dreams> !uptime
[1:45:02] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 45 minutes
[1:45:05] <%The_Timo> Pretty close lol
[1:45:08] <taptapmuhgap> Im just glad he didn't clam up or we wouldn't know where to go
[1:45:12] <+Omegaanimus> like no matter what you have the blood and kidneys thing taken care of
[1:45:15] <%mrhandsss> got like 1-2 hours of play before they hit THAT point
[1:45:26] <zenith0111> You're on the final stretch so you might as well have the mindset of no breaks
[1:45:27] <+agumon9000> I would concider this the point of no return
[1:45:35] <VidulaSaix> it's not
[1:45:37] <%The_Timo> the red dress?

[1:45:44] <+Ancopro> ann it would add to all your OTHER gold
[1:45:49] <@Solidus_113> We're already past no return, but we're not past the point where you can stop and continue
[1:45:50] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:45:56] <peachy996> Killing old men, ignoring babies for cash, wanting a gold skull mask
[1:46:08] <Aydarkzero> hated that bt scene happening every minute
[1:46:11] <%mrhandsss> on top of that, who knows how long it'll take them to figure out how to continue
[1:46:19] <+drfaustisdead> Where's Woolie going?
[1:46:20] <BurdRightsActivist> @peachy996 when I got to the secret room I was so fucking sad they didn't give me a gold mask ):
[1:46:20] <zenith0111> @vidulasaix They just need to walk to one location and the final sequence happens. So this is the final stretch
[1:46:20] <Aydarkzero> almost stopped me from playing the rest of the game

[1:59:39] <%jiggy_snipe> Reggie gets it LUL
[1:59:46] <zenith0111> Bringing a gun to a strand fight Kappa nice
[1:59:47] <%ChoculaUltra> kinda wish you could pee on the strand and use it as like a whip against BTs. Basically Castlevania.
[1:59:48] <Ricobana> combooos

[2:00:16] <+freeizone> "eat bugs" says kojima Kappa
[2:00:16] <zenith0111> @choculaultra Pee doesn't harm BTs
[2:00:16] <Rixstarian> @woolieversus Take your strand & chokejerk him!
[2:00:16] <Tucker0603> @chesterr01 make sure he PARRIES him
[2:00:19] <QaizerArt> @chesterr01 There are cryptobiotes around Woolie can eat to regain health.
[2:00:26] <+Omegaanimus> if you piss on someone's hand while they're holding a weapon it counts as a parry
[2:00:31] <samuraijakanddaxter> eat biotes
[2:00:34] <GarbageNirvana> Man, it's like one of those dreams when you're trying to run away from something but your legs are jelly
[2:00:41] <%mrhandsss> troy grows tired of your stalling
[2:00:41] <Graxe_> Higgs has fully embraced letting it set in
[2:00:51] <%ChoculaUltra> @zenith0111 does it still make them back off a bit?
[2:00:58] <zenith0111> @choculaultra Ye

[2:01:05] <Ricobana> dudley this dude!
[2:01:05] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> I love how hes even spouting generic videogame boss trash talk
[2:01:06] <darkbotle> He is such a dork and I love it
[2:01:18] <+freeizone> woolie runs to the side of the map with no items, cover or anything LUL
[2:01:40] <samuraijakanddaxter> u can stealth strand him too
[2:01:43] <+agumon9000> PLAYSTATION 4
[2:01:43] <alrobot2014> yo is that a ps4 on the ground'
[2:01:45] <+agumon9000> PICK UP THE PS4
[2:01:45] <%Solidnick18> lol
[2:01:48] <pirateofpie> Throw something at him
[2:01:49] <+Ryu_R> too real
[2:01:51] <derap41> Serpentine woolie serpentine
[2:01:54] <%Sparkseid> Stealth him
[2:01:54] <+Omegaanimus> Sam Rickon Bridges
[2:01:55] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Woolie just chuck something at him
[2:01:56] <Tucker0603> use cargo to confuse him
[2:02:00] <zenith0111> PS4 IS AN ANCIENT DEVICE
[2:02:01] <Pappajimbo> sneak behind and rope
[2:02:02] <%mrhandsss> throw stuff at him
[2:02:08] <jorniev> volume up a bit?
[2:02:12] <%Solidnick18> throw something and hit him woolie
[2:02:13] <BurdRightsActivist> Backseating 4Head
[2:02:14] <dero45> Lexhaust his dialogue
[2:02:18] <derap41> This is a DS1 Gwyn fight
[2:02:21] <kulmoth> don't forget you can throw cargo :)
[2:02:21] <@Solidus_113> woolie you have to hit him
[2:02:23] <zenith0111> brucegBackseat brucegBackseat brucegBackseat brucegBackseat
[2:02:25] <+freeizone> first technque learned is effective
[2:02:37] <%valriot> POCKET SAND
[2:02:37] <jorniev> the power of boxes woolie
[2:02:50] <derap41> Woolie never learned to parry did he
[2:02:54] <illTemperedSeaBass> It's a good thing this fuckhead's such a bad shot.
[2:02:55] <%jiggy_snipe> he'll swing at close range I believe
[2:02:55] <GarbageNirvana> I wonder what happens if you don't ever engage him
[2:03:04] <@Solidus_113> PLAYSTATION
[2:03:11] <%Exiliator> Throw that Playstation in his face!
[2:03:16] <darkbotle> get it? It's a straaaand game
[2:03:18] <Pappajimbo> pffth
[2:03:20] <Graxe_> Throw that old destroyed PS1
[2:03:21] <+Omegaanimus> if only you had a gen 1 Xbox to hit him with
[2:03:23] <zenith0111> Woolie somehow created his own dilemma NotLikeThis
[2:03:24] <BurdRightsActivist> @GarbageNirvana He has the ping system the Mules use, so he'll find you eventually
[2:03:26] <Tuna_Can_0> must be the PS3 LUL
[2:03:29] <+Omegaanimus> those things were bullet proof
[2:03:29] <Tucker0603> @chesterr01 use cargo to stealth up on him
[2:03:34] <alrobot2014> @Omegaanimus or even just the duke
[2:03:43] <alrobot2014> toss that controller at him and he'd die
[2:03:43] <%Solidnick18> maybe when he reloads
[2:03:45] <%jiggy_snipe> run up and parry
[2:03:45] <%Prevot> a gamecube would be perfect, it has a handle and is fucking indestructible
[2:03:56] <+Omegaanimus> an Xbox controller tied to a rope
[2:04:01] <+Omegaanimus> god
[2:04:02] <Pappajimbo> in the uk ps1s are considerd leath weapons
[2:04:03] <samuraijakanddaxter> get an eye on him, sneak round, stealth takedown, then just bang on him
[2:04:06] <darkbotle> the entire beach is just the xbox og
[2:04:06] <peachy996> Nah the Old PS3 would be the best to chuck
[2:04:07] <%mrhandsss> parrying and using the strand does more damage but i think so does using destroyed items as weapons
[2:04:15] <VidulaSaix> That was super not the counter LUL
[2:04:22] <@Solidus_113> you can wrap up after the parry
[2:04:22] <dero45> Stealth kiss him
[2:04:23] <peachy996> The big fat black juggernaut of a system
[2:04:25] <%Swedish_Expert> strand him after the parry
[2:04:25] <+Ryu_R> keep it out and you can tie hiim up
[2:04:26] <+D00msDayDan> @woolieversus you can still pick up cargo with the strand equipped
[2:04:26] <%mrhandsss> no you can tie him up with it after the parry
[2:04:27] <Shishi1205> you can wrap up
[2:04:27] <+Javaa01> You need to tie him up after the parry
[2:04:29] <%GeneralSCPatton> NOT THE COUNTER
[2:04:30] <+Omegaanimus> someone once shot a gun at an Xbox and it didn't break the casing
[2:04:33] <zenith0111> NotLikeThis
[2:04:34] <%jiggy_snipe> @chester01 you can hogtie him
[2:04:36] <Tucker0603> messed up parry, you can tie him up
[2:04:38] <+Ryu_R> gotta hold L2
[2:04:38] <%Sparkseid> tie him up after parry
[2:04:45] <MyNameIsRasus> Keep holding L2
[2:04:48] <@Solidus_113> it said bind...
[2:04:48] <zenith0111> Because mashing always works Jebaited
[2:04:48] <Tuna_Can_0> stealth hug him he could use one
[2:04:49] <%mrhandsss> missed the prompt
[2:04:51] <derap41> Never bring a gun to a fist fight

[3:10:16] <%wydamn> @Nomad94 That's actually pretty interesting and a nice subtle reference
[3:10:35] <@Solidus_113> the ultimate gottem
[3:10:42] <VidulaSaix> LUL
[3:10:46] <Nomad94> Pizza is always plot-significant
[3:10:50] <%jiggy_snipe> "plot significant"
[3:10:50] <Nomad94> üçï
[3:10:50] <VidulaSaix> We told you it'd be worth
[3:10:51] <%Solidnick18> same
[3:10:59] <derap41> Its pretty much only is
[3:11:00] <karl_rex> Englert was the last name of a man who worked alongside Peter Higgs
[3:11:03] <samuraijakanddaxter> i never saw that coming either
[3:11:03] <MyNameIsRasus> Thots in england = Twoys, Those Wenches Over Yonder
[3:11:09] <Nomad94> @karl_rex You were too slow LUL
[3:11:11] <VidulaSaix> And yeah the Peter name has meaning
[3:11:19] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus didn't you say you thought the pizza finale would never live up to the hype
[3:11:21] <shadic7700> The BURGERS of Kasahira Miller
[3:11:21] <Pappajimbo> it was fun for higgs
[3:11:21] <DukeBlack_> what happen so far. Just got back from an interview
[3:11:25] <VidulaSaix> @chesterr01 Per Nomad else in chat Two of the scientists involved with the Higgs Boson were Peter Higgs and Francois Englert ¬∞L¬∞
[3:11:29] <+Ancopro> like a gold pizza
[3:11:31] <heartlesshealer> To Sam Bridges, all lore is optional. He just wants to make deliveries
[3:11:38] <%jiggy_snipe> that would be funny
[3:11:41] <Nomad94> Scan my pizza Sam
[3:11:43] <peachy996> Higgs is holding all the cards now
[3:11:48] <XenoSentience> LUL
[3:11:50] <vVAstrAVv> you cant miss pizza ont worry
[3:11:56] <peachy996> He's holding all the pizza slips
[3:12:49] <+Ancopro> "40 minutes or less, right Sam?"
[3:12:52] <vVAstrAVv> hes trying his best eoolie lol
[3:12:57] <samuraijakanddaxter> so can you get to this part, killing higgs, having never started the entire pizza delivery quest?
[3:13:06] <kulmoth> woolie as "turned-around-man"
[3:13:25] <derap41> You have to kill Higgs its part of the main quest but the pizza is optional
[3:13:27] <KnivesEve> did woolie activate pizza mode or not yet
[3:13:32] <gunsrlove> BOOT
[3:13:33] <@Solidus_113> going to it now
[3:13:50] <vVAstrAVv> just bola him lol
[3:14:04] <XenoSentience> Metal Death Solid: Sons of Stranding
[3:14:12] <samuraijakanddaxter> would be weird doing a bunch of the pizza deliveries after higgs is dead then and still getting emails from him each time
[3:14:19] <MyNameIsRasus> That animation will never work
[3:14:47] <am_omega> Maybe Higgs programmed a computer to send pizzas to his place.
[3:14:53] <blaggablag> "does this rope smell like takedown?"
[3:14:54] <Ricobana> piss on him
[3:14:54] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> whats fun is that Sam is still doing this despite Higgs being gone. this is why hes the Great Deliverer. never disappoint, even the dead.
[3:15:01] <vVAstrAVv> who sais es dead i didn't see im shot onacreen
[3:15:07] <Ricobana> argh
[3:15:10] <%jiggy_snipe> the ultimate postal worker
[3:15:12] <peachy996> I want to see that
[3:15:16] <heartlesshealer> BB would know
[3:15:20] <vVAstrAVv> why i my phone kb so bad
[3:15:24] <BurdRightsActivist> Higg's ghost prevent you from PISSING
[3:15:25] <Tedious_Tickles> There's an answer to that later @samuraijakanddaxter
[3:15:26] <Ricobana> maybe give a lil distance then try
[3:15:31] <@Solidus_113> piss on his pizza
[3:15:34] <ALTRNico> best you can do is throw your excretion bombs on them
[3:15:36] <derap41> why even give peeing as weapon if you can't use it on people
[3:15:40] <MyNameIsRasus> You have to be a role model for BB, Reggie!!
[3:15:44] <heartlesshealer> I mean Lou, I forgot Woolie was far enough for name

[4:00:05] <lyzejag> Who
[4:00:15] <Tedious_Tickles> a delusional grown ass man
[4:00:16] <Rosswelle> @Psyramics NEET just means youre not employed, in school, or in training. so even if he did leave to fuck with you, hes still technically a NEET

[4:09:17] <+bread_assassin> Science: 1 Woolie: 0
[4:09:20] <jorniev> the best part about kojima is the amount of work and research that goes into making all his bullshit.

[4:10:15] <samuraijakanddaxter> shape of water is what you were supposed to know, and the creature from the black lagoon

[4:12:57] <+D00msDayDan> higgs was just some fucking nobody amelie picked up to use
[4:12:57] <VidulaSaix> Yeah
[4:12:57] <heartlesshealer> time to speculate =)
[4:12:58] <@SoushinSen> they fucked.
[4:13:00] <peachy996> Amelie is a bad
[4:13:00] <XenoSentience> moon2DOIT
[4:13:01] <lyzejag> He got pegged so hard and got super powers
[4:13:04] <samuelfisk> Higgs did the Galactus deal
[4:13:04] <%Prevot> so he was basically the previous sam
[4:13:07] <Pappajimbo> played like a fiddle
[4:13:09] <%The_Timo> Lol now it clicks lol
[4:13:15] <+drfaustisdead> he was kneeling before her.
[4:13:16] <+Ancopro> babUM
[4:13:17] <VidulaSaix> FIDDLED
[4:13:21] <%jiggy_snipe> it looked like she was knighting him
[4:13:25] <+linSP> higgs was the one who was used
[4:13:27] <Pappajimbo> he was kneeling in front of her

[4:20:48] <Graxe_> Oh, Higgs has no idea about what Cliff is
[4:20:51] <VidulaSaix> He had no idea
[4:21:00] <MyNameIsRasus> Dadds

[4:21:24] <Asuxley> damn that was edgy
[4:21:27] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> yep Higgs is just a loser that gained powers
[4:21:30] <%Superbro64> I dont know how to feel about this
[4:21:34] <MyNameIsRasus> He literally lives on the Edge
[4:21:54] <%Superbro64> He's like this close to being a Shadow the Hedgegog roleplayer
[4:22:02] <VidulaSaix> I love how he writes these journals as if he KNWOS Sam will read them LUL
[4:22:03] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Im gonna be a boss fight, Sam!

[4:22:27] <VidulaSaix> A stupid fool FeelsBadMan
[4:22:28] <illTemperedSeaBass> Even Shadow the Hedgehog redeemed himself into a halfway decent sapient being, @Superbro64 ... this is worse than that.
[4:22:29] <%Superbro64> He probably plays only dark side runs of Shadow the Hedgehog, doesnt he? doodSinwata
[4:22:32] <Nomad94> Macbeth

[4:23:00] <%Exiliator> OVER THE EDGE
[4:23:04] <GodKingReiss> Edgier than Edge Knot City?
[4:23:04] <Nomad94> He loved the theatrics too much
[4:23:05] <peachy996> He is a dumb nerd who wanted to be Sasuke but wasn't special enough

[4:23:36] <am_omega> Yeah he is chuuni as fuck.
[4:23:48] <+DesertPenguin> !UPTIME
[4:23:49] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 4 hours and 23 minutes
[4:23:57] <%The_Timo> She was most likely using him for some reason
[4:23:57] <illTemperedSeaBass> @Superbro64 That's fair. A misguided edgy take on an already edgycharacter.
[4:23:59] <peachy996> YES
[4:24:10] <Graxe_> It's all Amelie's fault
[4:24:15] <peachy996> Everybody commit to the true cult "Amelie a shit"
[4:24:15] <zenith0111> ADVANCE THE HATE
[4:24:17] <+drfaustisdead> it's... really complicated...
[4:24:20] <BurdRightsActivist> HOLDO MANEUVER
[4:24:23] <samuraijakanddaxter> it seems amelie is playing both sides
[4:24:23] <zenith0111> HATE ARMS RACE
[4:24:24] <redrins> fuck ajnalie
[4:24:24] <Graxe_> Higgs only ended up the way he is because Amelie did her thing to him
[4:24:25] <@Solidus_113> To Lake Knot!
[4:24:25] <BluBox> She needs to GO!
[4:24:31] <%Superbro64> to be fair, that dumb disguise, song and dance when he gave you the nuke, acting up for a pizza guy, and his general eccentricities now make A LOT of sense now
[4:24:33] <%Superbro64> huh
[4:24:34] <+TossuDa> evo19Rage
[4:24:34] <Graxe_> Onto Lake Knot
[4:24:34] <%Prevot> #FuckPrincessBeach
[4:24:36] <am_omega> Thursday will be wild.
[4:24:36] <phatmac16> Incest is wincest
[4:24:38] <VidulaSaix> No no Solidus he needs to stop unless they wanna go for at least another hour
[4:24:46] <%Superbro64> I kinda just am now meh on this character
[4:24:47] <peachy996> She's the worst part about the game story
[4:24:48] <Ricobana> Yeees @Prevot
[4:24:55] <Hammatime8> You probably shouldn't fuck Amelie beacuse sister Kappa
[4:24:56] <peachy996> And we will see why Thursday
[4:24:59] <Tucker0603> make those golden guns though
[4:25:11] <phatmac16> You're right Woolie
[4:25:13] <Graxe_> Cliff just wants his kid back
[4:25:16] <am_omega> T h u r s d a y
[4:25:19] <Ricobana> the actually worst family
[4:25:19] <Tedious_Tickles> Cliff is the only good boy
[4:25:26] <Wolfhart555> He should have just ate those pizzas
[4:25:28] <%Superbro64> this dude was literally all bark and no actually bite. He was given vampire dentures essentially
[4:25:34] <+loukemia83> This is just for real dumb and pointless
[4:25:43] <Dingo_Eejit> What's the deal with THURSDAY ?
[4:25:46] <am_omega> Local UPS man deals with End Time cult
[4:25:49] <VidulaSaix> Higgs was a great showman, but he was just that. A showman. He couldn't back up his talk for shit
[4:25:55] <blaggablag> His entire life schtick is "please sign here"
[4:25:58] <illTemperedSeaBass> If this guy was just, like, a Nihilistic Absolutist, rather than this Lord Admiral Doomer-McEdgeington, he'd have been so much better.
[4:25:59] <Hammatime8> At least the seal hood is still your friend :)
[4:26:03] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Final round on Thursday
[4:26:11] <%Superbro64> he's a showman that thinks he real hot shit, thats the problem for me

[4:26:31] <+agumon9000> @WoolieVersus You way passed it
[4:26:31] <%tattleworm> this is a good place, just don't forget about your fancy new guns next time
[4:26:31] <Shishi1205> but yeah
[4:26:33] <Tedious_Tickles> it's a good checkpoint, next time could be the final one... maybe
[4:26:34] <Tucker0603> this is fine
[4:26:36] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> this is where i stopped and it was the best idea
[4:26:40] <peachy996> next time we tell Amelie she's a shit
[4:26:43] <%RyTYoung> Yup
[4:26:43] <+NotHereToStream> prepare popcorns and drink
[4:26:44] <@Solidus_113> Lake Knot is one more big section
[4:26:44] <samuraijakanddaxter> the pop off
[4:26:44] <Nomad94> ye
[4:26:46] <+JacknZack27> Its a good place
[4:26:47] <+NotHereToStream> I mean it
[4:26:48] <heartlesshealer> Hopefully just 6
[4:26:56] <RunningNGunning> This is a good place to stop
[4:26:57] <Ricobana> did not expect it to briefly turn into a fighting game
[4:26:57] <Shishi1205> Lake + ending
[4:26:57] <Wolfhart555> GG the end is wild as hell, enjoy
[4:26:58] <am_omega> Get your drinks and popcorn as well.
[4:27:10] <+D00msDayDan> this is the perfect point to stop to knock out the rest in one stream
[4:27:10] <Dingo_Eejit> @am_omega - huh, didn't figure there be any left - Thanks yo
[4:27:14] <+linSP> yos
[4:27:37] <Nested_Dreams> Baaaii
[4:27:40] <+drfaustisdead> woolie angry at white woman! News at 11.
[4:27:42] <VidulaSaix> That whole 30 seconds of Princess Beach is probably the cringiest thing Kojima has ever done. It's the actual worst.
[4:27:52] <%RyTYoung> Gotta check out what i missed later
[4:27:54] <@Solidus_113> There's a chance you might have to delay GIFG a bit, depending on travel and combat skill
[4:27:57] <%wydamn> So boy's, thoughts? Expectations?
[4:28:01] <Nomad94> @VidulaSaix Don't pretend you don't love the pain
[4:28:10] <+linSP> the cringiest was making sam smile while running along the beach
[4:28:10] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:28:13] <+Ancopro> Amelie more like Famelie
[4:28:14] <%Prevot> because woolie
[4:28:20] <powerprotoman> join us next time when woolie drops this game in disgust and starts up luigis mansion 3 a game about doing menial labor against a super natural force while carying a young impresionable new lifeform in a glass container
[4:28:20] <%RyTYoung> More like 4-5
[4:28:23] <illTemperedSeaBass> @Nomad94 We're not embracing Chaos. This is *not* a good pain.
[4:28:25] <peachy996> 5 at most
[4:28:26] <VidulaSaix> Nah the 6 is factoring in reading
[4:28:28] <Shishi1205> its mostly cutscene
[4:28:30] <+D00msDayDan> no it's just a LOT of tuscenes
[4:28:34] <peachy996> At your slowest pace, 5
[4:28:35] <%wydamn> Amelie? More like AMErica LIE
[4:28:39] <Nomad94> LUL
[4:28:46] <+Taglog7> Yall, lookin crisp
[4:28:47] <peachy996> But I think you'll get to 4
[4:28:47] <%jiggy_snipe> 1 to 8 then hour break
[4:28:59] <VidulaSaix> Gameplay wise you have maybe an hour left
[4:29:00] <VidulaSaix> Possibly 2
[4:29:01] <+Felto3> its a kojima ending, bring food
[4:29:01] <@Solidus_113> There's 2 hours of just cutscenes
[4:29:05] <Nomad94> If you massively fuck up, you might go over tiem
[4:29:06] <ManlyMcBeefington> eat during cutscenes save time before fighting games.
[4:29:10] <berserker_103> Post game gives you tons of mails tho
[4:29:11] <%DatAsuna> It'll be a full day
[4:29:12] <peachy996> OH wait nvm I'm forgetting some events: 5, def 5
[4:29:17] <Thepothero> Very interesting stream today woolie and reggie xxxSHH xxxJA
[4:29:20] <blaggablag> Yeah just get some popcorn and soldier through
[4:29:21] <%wydamn> GENIUS KOJUMBO
[4:29:25] <am_omega> Bruh the finale is like two movies. Get comfortable.
[4:29:39] <heartlesshealer> Well, I have faith in Woolie figuring out the end faster than Pat did, but not sure how much that might cut the time
[4:29:44] <%RyTYoung> Get that popcorn for next time booooooois
[4:29:54] <Shishi1205> for sure
[4:29:55] <castcola> yeyeye
[4:29:56] <%jiggy_snipe> LUL
[4:29:58] <%Exiliator> üá∫üá∏ woolieREGGIEFUL
[4:29:58] <VidulaSaix> Pat just refused to accept what the game was telling him and just kept saying "That makes no sense"
[4:29:59] <GarbageNirvana> It was entertaining
[4:29:59] <VidulaSaix> LUL
[4:29:59] <@Solidus_113> That boxing match was pretty good
[4:30:00] <+Javaa01> Oh yeah, this was a great session
[4:30:02] <%wydamn> The Peter Higgs reveal was great
[4:30:03] <+drfaustisdead> what do you mean "you people" Reggie?
[4:30:04] <@SoushinSen> Reggie uncultered don't know shit about fishmen
[4:30:06] <Nomad94> Higgs was the best pizza man
[4:30:07] <am_omega> Oh yeah I set my day free for Thursday.
[4:30:08] <heartlesshealer> Thanks for hosting, guys
[4:30:13] <+Felto3> what about princess beach
[4:30:13] <Graxe_> Higgs had some good pizza
[4:30:16] <%The_Timo> Lol I enjoyed you struggle to grasp ANYTHING that was going on Reggie lol
[4:30:23] <Graxe_> Also, where does that last pizza go
[4:30:23] <%RyTYoung> That goddamn champagne
[4:30:26] <Nomad94> When's the last time a game made you deliver pizza to the Big Bad?
[4:30:27] <Graxe_> Since he's dead
[4:30:41] <%tattleworm> the reaction of "you're better than this" to that beach scene was literally exactly mine
[4:30:43] <samuraijakanddaxter> he was actually pretty pathetic
[4:30:45] <Dingo_Eejit> High maintenance Basement King
[4:30:46] <eldragon_1> You should order a pizza for the next session LUL
[4:30:52] <+NotHereToStream> higgs was very 1 dimensional
[4:30:53] <%DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus btw reggie the fake name is Peter Engelert cause the scientists who discovered the Higgs mechanism were Peter Higgs and Fran√ßois Englert
[4:30:56] <sugarveins> Why
[4:31:08] <%RyTYoung> Higgs dlc plz
[4:31:09] <phatmac16> Hes lame
[4:31:11] <am_omega> ye ye ye order pizza for the finale, for Higgs.
[4:31:14] <xanerts> kinda lika zant from tp
[4:31:17] <VidulaSaix> @WoolieVersus Per someone in chat earlier; Two of the scientists involved with the Higgs Boson were Peter Higgs and Francois Englert ¬∞L¬∞
[4:31:18] <webdesserts> The important question: How do y‚Äôall feel about princess beach?
[4:31:18] <Ricobana> higgs got cool powers and decided the world should end
[4:31:27] <+linSP> higgs grew up in a bad place
[4:31:33] <samuraijakanddaxter> he was an impressionable, desperate, loser type
[4:31:44] <%The_Timo> And then it's gunshot off screen which is so not satisfying as it leaves it rather ambiguous
[4:31:45] <JaseAdrift> RlyTho
[4:31:49] <Ricobana> the worst, princess beach followed up with that run
[4:31:52] <%jiggy_snipe> he was the red herring
[4:31:53] <MahoganyWoods> "Got cool powers? Time to fuck my mother!"
[4:31:57] <VidulaSaix> Don't worry, you'll get all the answers you want. They might not be good answers, but you'll get them.
[4:31:59] <phatmac16> He's meant to be a loser
[4:32:00] <%DatAsuna> The only thing higgs has going for him is pizza
[4:32:02] <heartlesshealer> Oi, that's for Thursday
[4:32:05] <+Javaa01> There are still some interviews missing for Higgs, so there is a bit more still
[4:32:13] <Ricobana> @MahoganyWoods LUL
[4:32:13] <%DatAsuna> and his dumb fake name
[4:32:21] <%DatAsuna> That's not just a youth thing
[4:32:22] <Dingo_Eejit> Yeah, don't wanna regert ther words...
[4:32:22] <%jiggy_snipe> LUL school shooter man
[4:32:24] <VidulaSaix> LUL
[4:32:24] <illTemperedSeaBass> ... So Twitter?
[4:32:25] <samuraijakanddaxter> thats higgs
[4:32:26] <samuraijakanddaxter> lmao
[4:32:26] <Tuna_Can_0> LUL
[4:32:27] <Zayasu> LUL
[4:32:28] <%Exiliator> LUL
[4:32:28] <am_omega> LUL
[4:32:29] <+OmegaWeltall> yea 4chan basicaly?
[4:32:30] <Shishi1205> LUL
[4:32:31] <+Taglog7> That's not me
[4:32:32] <%DatAsuna> Lot of angry boomers online dude
[4:32:33] <heartlesshealer> all
[4:32:37] <redrins> higgcel
[4:32:41] <am_omega> But yo /m/ is alright.
[4:32:43] <%DatAsuna> Well angry gen Xers to be exact
[4:32:45] <samuraijakanddaxter> he woulda been a school shooter if schools still existed in the stranding
[4:32:46] <%jiggy_snipe> they don't have the remaining Higgs story?
[4:32:48] <VidulaSaix> Someone gave him purpose in a world that was already hopeless
[4:32:55] <+OmegaWeltall> higgs is /v/
[4:33:04] <am_omega> Higgs is totally /v/
[4:33:09] <+OmegaWeltall> fucking normies! get off my board! REEEEEEEEEEEE
[4:33:10] <%Exiliator> 4chan is less hate and more all emotions at once
[4:33:12] <redrins> yeah we do
[4:33:16] <VidulaSaix> Uhh yeah we do
[4:33:18] <%Exiliator> in a big ball of fuck
[4:33:18] <%jiggy_snipe> you can still learn some more about hi past
[4:33:24] <velestionhammer> I come from /m/ and just like cool robots!
[4:33:31] <blaggablag> you literally got done reading his entire backstory what are you talking about
[4:33:32] <phatmac16> He got abused by his dad
[4:33:33] <+Javaa01> Or alternately also /pol/, just without the outright racism
[4:33:39] <am_omega> Yeahh fellow /m/en
[4:33:47] <VidulaSaix> We don't know everything but the interviews you read give a good bit about his backstory
[4:33:51] <VidulaSaix> Woolie you JUST read it
[4:33:52] <illTemperedSeaBass> Reddit is specifically hate, just mostly directed inward. 4Chan is weaponized autism that can really only agree on anti-establishmentarianism.
[4:34:00] <MahoganyWoods> What would this game look like if he was from /wooo/?
[4:34:03] <+JacknZack27> You learn about his past from journal entires
[4:34:11] <+Taglog7> BrokeBack
[4:34:15] <%The_Timo> But he was led to believe he was more in control than he actually was
[4:34:23] <+linSP> you read about his childhood and abusive caretaker
[4:34:23] <+Proxzo> I think he's into it
[4:34:24] <samuraijakanddaxter> he only realised late on that he was actually a cog
[4:34:28] <redrins> his other journal entries
[4:34:29] <+NotHereToStream> yet again, charistmatic, but 1 dimensional
[4:34:31] <phatmac16> Hes a troll too
[4:34:37] <Muffinmastr> HEy EVERYONE <3
[4:34:40] <%DatAsuna> higgs sucks
[4:34:44] <%jiggy_snipe> he was an abused kid with a god complex and he's a troll
[4:34:50] <am_omega> Yeah he is /v/eddit.
[4:34:54] <%Exiliator> 4chan is a big ball of force constantly fighting itself, until you poke it, then it all comes flying at YOU
[4:34:56] <DukeBlack_> so like a real dickhead
[4:35:00] <samuraijakanddaxter> he didnt know he was a cog the whole time with amelie
[4:35:01] <blaggablag> I'll say one thing tho, at some point he went from porter leader to getting cool armored goons and I'd really like to know about THAT
[4:35:01] <Ricobana> he has imposter syndrome
[4:35:04] <+D00msDayDan> the ending is gonna dump so much shit on him too fast for him to process and he's gonna draw all the wrong conclusions about everything
[4:35:12] <MahoganyWoods> hi @Muffinmastr HeyGuys
[4:35:12] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:35:16] <velestionhammer> imposter syndrome sucks
[4:35:18] <heartlesshealer> Amelie started backing out, and then Higgs was all "Nah, we doin' this"
[4:35:28] <bakersvile> Kojima retweeted some Higgs bondage fanart yesterday
[4:35:34] <velestionhammer> oh no
[4:35:37] <%Exiliator> He's... a dick
[4:35:38] <VidulaSaix> Woolie you JUST read it like 15 minutes ago. He was a porter going about everyday life like everyone else and then came across Amelie and it gave him a new purpose in his life, and eventually he found out that he was being used and acted out against it
[4:35:38] <Djinnazz> Yeah, he‚Äôs a douchebag
[4:35:41] <Muffinmastr> Did woolie check out higgs room?
[4:35:50] <Djinnazz> Yrah
[4:35:52] <Tedious_Tickles> he did Muffin
[4:35:53] <am_omega> And sometimes 4chan's weaponized autisim can do amazing things. Sometimes not good and sometimes pointless but amazing things.
[4:36:00] <samuraijakanddaxter> he thought amelie was actually making him important, then he found out very late in the story that it was bullshit
[4:36:05] <+Proxzo> I think he was Nihilistic, and Amelie was a way for him to dive into that fantasy.
[4:36:05] <VidulaSaix> He's not a deep Metal Gear villain
[4:36:08] <+drfaustisdead> I think the fact that Higgs is a Nihilist and one dimensional is actually intended. Because there's only one end, death.
[4:36:20] <%Prevot> blame amelie
[4:36:32] <+Proxzo> I think Amelie probably saw that and used him for it.
[4:36:33] <+agumon9000> Cabbage
[4:36:40] <%Exiliator> @am_omega busting that cat torturer is a favorite
[4:36:42] <+NotHereToStream> it would of been interesting had higgs been a complete antithesis of sam
[4:36:51] <Muffinmastr> how else are we gonna get that sweet boxing match?
[4:36:57] <am_omega> That villain is nothing compared to King Leo from 2.
[4:36:58] <heartlesshealer> shhhhhhhh
[4:37:04] <Muffinmastr> oh :S
[4:37:10] <jorniev> higgs is like culprit
[4:37:12] <+Taglog7> Pancakes
[4:37:20] <+agumon9000> This taste
[4:37:24] <+agumon9000> is the taste of a porter
[4:37:24] <+eanscrale> Faces taste good I guess?
[4:37:28] <am_omega> @Exiliator and finding out about the guy who was killing old people in a caretaking facility.
[4:37:31] <JFrostyBeats> @am_omega king leo was just crazy.
[4:37:38] <samuraijakanddaxter> he was incredibly dissatisfied with his life, amelie promised big shit, he fell for it hook line and sinker
[4:37:42] <%jiggy_snipe> but when you look at his shelter, you see he's a huge dork showman
[4:37:44] <am_omega> Yes but its similar to Higgs.
[4:37:52] <am_omega> Especially in IS.
[4:37:54] <jorniev> im basically like higgs to be honest
[4:37:59] <am_omega> Not so much in EP.
[4:38:00] <blaggablag> I mean, he literally knows about the inevitable end of the world. That's enough for someone to go Lovecraft style insane
[4:38:01] <%Exiliator> Hugedorkshowman LUL another character
[4:38:02] <%DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus Never forget the ultimate reason to be discount gendo ikari "I'm an antheist therefore I'm amoral"
[4:38:03] <heartlesshealer> Not so much lonely as ripe for exploitation
[4:38:04] <%The_Timo> Putting more thought into it than the writers did with that one lol
[4:38:06] <redrins> his earlier journal entries???
[4:38:07] <Ricobana> it was like he was trying to be his idealized ubermensch
[4:38:07] <peachy996> he had Fragile
[4:38:07] <+NocturnePsycho> so hes a simp?
[4:38:08] <@Solidus_113> You are missing journals 5-9
[4:38:10] <%jiggy_snipe> LUL
[4:38:10] <samuraijakanddaxter> in his early joirnals he talks about having bad relationship with his dad etc
[4:38:12] <VidulaSaix> Thank you Reggie
[4:38:16] <jorniev> i just want things to end i just dont have control over it
[4:38:25] <VidulaSaix> You can read into what he says in his journals to understand what kind of person he is
[4:38:25] <DukeBlack_> if you see something as a light obviously you feel like your trapped
[4:38:28] <+JacknZack27> The journal entries from before
[4:38:31] <+Taglog7> Stop talking about me
[4:38:34] <+drfaustisdead> Also the fact that Higgs is a nihilist is the direct antithesis to the game's primary ethos, connections.
[4:38:36] <VidulaSaix> It doesn't need to be explicitly said
[4:38:37] <phatmac16> Reggie is right
[4:38:39] <+agumon9000> You are missing journals so there is still some bits missing of the whole picture
[4:38:43] <VidulaSaix> Thank god for Reggie BlessRNG
[4:38:57] <+linSP> remember though, people with dooms have nightmares of the world ending, so a guy with a traumatic childhood like him might be affected more than the other UCA peeps
[4:38:59] <+PanicSwytch> Reggie is on to something
[4:39:06] <xanerts> he is a huge loser dork that suddenly got hyper powers
[4:39:07] <vVAstrAVv> maybe higgs just did it for the super powers WOOLIE...we know you would lol
[4:39:08] <Shishi1205> Swing time aby
[4:39:09] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @D00msDayDan
[4:39:11] <%Exiliator> dududu-
[4:39:12] <VidulaSaix> Woolie, are you saying that the game should outright tell you that a person is a certain way for it to be what it is?
[4:39:12] <+Proxzo> His journal kinda makes it that way
[4:39:14] <%jiggy_snipe> I want Higgs on that swing
[4:39:14] <jorniev> he just became a police officer to get a gun
[4:39:17] <JaseAdrift> Reggie whlile uncultured has the right idea
[4:39:22] <Shishi1205> You have the journals there
[4:39:23] <samuraijakanddaxter> go back to the first four journal entries, i think they gave you a bit of what you want, woolie
[4:39:24] <+Taglog7> Were the soldiers real, tho?
[4:39:26] <heartlesshealer> Oh that's right, they're missing around 4 or 5 journals at least
[4:39:27] <sugarveins> Good
[4:39:28] <+D00msDayDan> @WoolieVersus it was in the journal entries you read previously
[4:39:31] <+CptBritches> I got pretty much that from the journals
[4:39:34] <Graxe_> Yeah, DOOMS give you powers and dreams of the future and stuff.
[4:39:39] <%DatAsuna> It's a headcanon
[4:39:40] <%jiggy_snipe> read the 1st four journals I think
[4:39:42] <redrins> reread his early journal entries
[4:39:44] <%Prevot> woolie is like "writers who use subtext are COWARDS"
[4:39:44] <+agumon9000> Its in the other journals
[4:39:47] <Muffinmastr> I dont think its represented well; but i think Higgs is self-isolated and represents a mindset that believes humanity is toxic towards the world
[4:39:48] <+NocturnePsycho> Ive never agreed with both sides so hard
[4:39:50] <am_omega> DOOMS literally makes you a Doomer.
[4:39:56] <+linSP> higgs wrote those anonymous interviews you read way back
[4:40:03] <Ricobana> idk, kojima doesnt really do subtext tho
[4:40:07] <+CptBritches> We truly are the doomers Sam
[4:40:09] <+JacknZack27> Look at his first journal entries again
[4:40:25] <redrins> read 1 to 4 again for a little more context
[4:40:31] <@Solidus_113> I have a link to the interviews on the DS Wiki
[4:40:31] <samuraijakanddaxter> and you read 1-4 not knowing it was higgs at the time so maybe it didnt stick with you
[4:40:36] <VidulaSaix> I'd recommend rereading his earlier stuff again, but yes you are still missing some
[4:40:50] <phatmac16> He parallels to Sam as a loner mailman but had a god complex due to his powers
[4:41:05] <am_omega> Nah the God Complex happened later.
[4:41:17] <Katorskay> Punch him
[4:41:32] <VidulaSaix> You also can look into how clearly obsessed with Sam he was based on his shelter that he clearly had issues
[4:41:34] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus there's also 24, 25, and 26 that you'll get at the end of the game IIRC
[4:41:38] <+Proxzo> Maybe nihilism is enough
[4:41:43] <+kyh9> He wants to be back on his tv-show
[4:41:50] <VidulaSaix> It IS implying it!
[4:41:53] <+NotHereToStream> the lucy interview tho, that one you need to look out for
[4:41:55] <gunsrlove> I'm just seeing Overthinking
[4:41:56] <JaseAdrift> man Nihilism can get you pretty far
[4:41:59] <xanerts> Reggie is pretty much right
[4:42:00] <Ricobana> maybe not a loneliness to have ppl around him
[4:42:03] <+Proxzo> I think the journals you read kinda read like he's going nuts over nihilism.
[4:42:05] <%jiggy_snipe> maybe he's just insane and obsessive
[4:42:07] <GarbageNirvana> Also think about who's writing this
[4:42:11] <+agumon9000> You missed it
[4:42:12] <peachy996> It's funny playing MK11 how I just hear Erron Black whenever he talks
[4:42:14] <VidulaSaix> You cant miss anything forever
[4:42:14] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1224743712657412096?s=19
[4:42:15] <Ricobana> but a loneliness iin "society" pbblt
[4:42:17] <Muffinmastr> i think its enough to imply that he can think beyond the human race.
[4:42:18] <+NotHereToStream> you need the lucy interview, that one is super important
[4:42:22] <jorniev> look up what nihilism is
[4:42:24] <+kyh9> Kojima "Subtlety is for weaklings" Hideo
[4:42:25] <samuraijakanddaxter> the impression i got is that he was very much a kind of middling in life kind of guy who had a rough relationship with his dad, who then got promised the world basically by amelie

[4:49:33] <%fingalights> They love Evil, Woolie. They LOVE it
[4:49:35] <VidulaSaix> Woolie just because you haven't seen something doesn't mean it can't possibly exist LUL
[4:49:36] <Dingo_Eejit> Says you
[4:49:36] <+D00msDayDan> god woolie really should have gotten that journal before this
[4:49:37] <+agumon9000> Metal Gear had a ton of that shit
[4:49:38] <JaseAdrift> Majma is calling
[4:49:39] <%tattleworm> sam, i got all the recessive dooms
[4:49:40] <%DatAsuna> That's what you think woolie
[4:49:46] <+NotHereToStream> the thing about crazy character is that you can't explain crazy, you have to accept it
[4:49:47] <am_omega> So Woolie is that why you like Naruto?
[4:49:49] <am_omega> kappa
[4:49:52] <+Razputin217> KIRYU-CHAN
[4:49:58] <%The_Timo> Mental Illness isn't something you should Shame someone for Woolz

[4:50:07] <KokujinDo> I just came in... excuse me what?
[4:50:08] <%jiggy_snipe> idk Woolie, you don't always need a reason to be evil
[4:50:10] <JaseAdrift> WOOLIE IS DIO
[4:50:12] <+NotHereToStream> if they act insane, you have to accept they are insane because you can't explain insane
[4:50:20] <@Solidus_113> Valentine did nothing wrong
[4:50:20] <Shishi1205> Dont do it jhonny
[4:50:23] <webdesserts> You can be come our grand truther
[4:50:25] <Tedious_Tickles> struggling to finish part 5 atm, don't even what to think about part 6 & 7 ( - _ -)
[4:50:29] <VidulaSaix> REggie is just like "I wanna go hit some shit man"
[4:50:32] <peachy996> There's something more free about being the giggling villain standing in the corner licking a knife
[4:50:37] <+smdlx> relatable consistent evil? ... Nolan's Joker?
[4:50:45] <samuraijakanddaxter> higgs was over doing it because this was new found power he was going mad with, and previously he was a nerd so this is what he thought was cool
[4:50:46] <phatmac16> Does DIO need a reason?
[4:50:47] <%The_Timo> Clip that out of context lol
[4:50:48] <Sogeki_Dan> When did Woolie get a good cam? wtf?
[4:50:49] <%Exiliator> Reggie could use some cacks about now
[4:50:58] <+kdallas_> madara in a nutshell
[4:51:15] <Shishi1205> Promise
[4:51:20] <VidulaSaix> So if it's not super complex and hard to argue with it's bad? Woolie cmon man LUL
[4:51:21] <JaseAdrift> Cult Leader Madden is awakening
[4:51:27] <+smdlx> Higgs was just a sciency oldskool ancient relics fanvoy showman gone full ret*rd :)
[4:51:29] <am_omega> Wow no wonder why Woolie loves Naruto Kappa
[4:51:30] <%jiggy_snipe> idk I like Kefka. I know why he's insane but whatever
[4:51:31] <Muffinmastr> I think Woolie would be more satisfied if he saw that Higgs didnt see himself as a villian, just opposed to bridge? what do yall think?
[4:51:32] <+eanscrale> If it lands, but a lot of the time the motive just ends up being stupid.
[4:51:33] <peachy996> Break out the Big Comfy Couch
[4:51:34] <%fingalights> Run, Reggie, run
[4:51:36] <+Taglog7> BIG CHAIR
[4:51:37] <phatmac16> Askeladd is the best
[4:51:44] <VidulaSaix> Higgs isnt SUPPOSED to be terrifying
[4:51:44] <karl_rex> Is Woolie leaving the Hidden Leaf Village?
[4:51:58] <powerprotoman> Woolie jsut decribing himself in jojo characters
[4:51:58] <Ricobana> reggie is being converted in front of our eyes
[4:52:04] <blaggablag> "because they do it with the admonishment of their own conscience" kind of thing
[4:52:08] <%The_Timo> It's some kind of mental illness... Some people just wanna watch the world burn. There are people who think to themselves. "I'll take them all down with me." This one just happened to take Drama classes lol
[4:52:10] <JaseAdrift> KNIFE LICKING IS COOL
[4:52:15] <VidulaSaix> Like Vamp? Kappa
[4:52:15] <%Exiliator> Woolie trying to get reggie to join the cult live
[4:52:15] <Muffinmastr> Higgs is just Sams Edgy older brother
[4:52:16] <+D00msDayDan> @powerprotoman woolie is incapable of describing things without using either jojo or fighting games
[4:52:16] <mirtosss> Whos he talking about?
[4:52:25] <%fingalights> I like my knife when I eat my dinner
[4:52:26] <+PanicSwytch> Woolie is Madara, Reggie is Orochimaru
[4:52:29] <samuraijakanddaxter> im a bit saddened that higgs' entire character has just totally flew by woolie, i think all the bits and pieces are there to put it together
[4:52:30] <peachy996> Noooo Knife Lickers are great
[4:52:30] <heartlesshealer> MGS is a good anime series
[4:52:33] <+D00msDayDan> oh yeah the goddamn b&b unit was soooooo interesting
[4:52:35] <powerprotoman> @KoalaBeige himself
[4:52:40] <%jiggy_snipe> stop trying to convert Reggie to the Universal Truth
[4:52:47] <peachy996> Psycho Mantis for example
[4:52:52] <phatmac16> The beauty and beast crew ResidentSleeper
[4:52:57] <peachy996> Knife Licker but he has a reason
[4:53:03] <+agumon9000> @WoolieVersus Woolie...why is he called Vamp
[4:53:07] <VidulaSaix> Woolie let's be real, far more of the villains in Metal Gear are bad than good
[4:53:09] <Muffinmastr> ill straight take a BITE outta that knife. tastes SHARRP
[4:53:12] <VidulaSaix> Very few of them are actually good
[4:53:13] <peachy996> Vamp LOVES TO LICK KNIVES
[4:53:24] <Ricobana> like magneto when hes bad
[4:53:25] <%jiggy_snipe> cuz he's a vampire Kappa
[4:53:34] <peachy996> Monsoon licks his own magnet-y parts
[4:53:43] <%Exiliator> Cuz hes a vampir- No jk its nanomachines
[4:53:48] <JaseAdrift> R/WOOSH
[4:53:49] <peachy996> Knife Lickers are underrated
[4:53:50] <%fingalights> They got steak sauce on there knife,
[4:53:56] <%fingalights> their....
[4:53:57] <Dingo_Eejit> you just did!
[4:53:57] <powerprotoman> the nessisary Evil the Universal Truth
[4:54:05] <samuraijakanddaxter> not every villain should be that
[4:54:13] <%Solidnick18> what happun
[4:54:14] <MichaelDood> Reggie saw it PogChamp
[4:54:22] <Shishi1205> @Solidus_113 did you tell woolie the chip thing
[4:54:29] <VidulaSaix> Wait I just realized, Woolie is doing Pats crazy ass argument of "If this thing is better, why bother with anything less?"
[4:54:32] <peachy996> The Necessary Evil needs to have good writing though otherwise they suck
[4:54:32] <am_omega> Bruh you have watched with Children of Men but you have not heard of the fucking Universal Monsters.
[4:54:33] <VidulaSaix> Oh no NotLikeThis
[4:54:41] <Muffinmastr> i used to suckle milk from a knife when i was young
[4:54:45] <samuraijakanddaxter> if every villain was like that imagine how boring media would be
[4:54:52] <VidulaSaix> Yeah for real
[4:54:57] <VidulaSaix> Sometimes you just need a loser
[4:54:57] <+NocturnePsycho> duragonist
[4:54:59] <VidulaSaix> Like culprit
[4:55:02] <mirtosss> I feel Woolie would enjoy the Aot manga a lot
[4:55:03] <%jiggy_snipe> if every villian was like that it would suck
[4:55:03] <powerprotoman> woolie wants stagnation in media
[4:55:06] <Zayasu> HahaCat
