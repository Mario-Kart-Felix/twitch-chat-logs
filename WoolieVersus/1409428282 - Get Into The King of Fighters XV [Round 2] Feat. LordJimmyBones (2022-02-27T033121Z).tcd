[0:00:08] <Treasure_Vault> DLC makes sense when devs are building something cool with all their experience making the original.
[0:00:09] <EpicBlur> I like DLC, so long as it's good, just like if a game is good
[0:00:19] <Treasure_Vault> Less cool when it's day 1 dlc
[0:00:43] <EpicBlur> I love this intro lol
[0:00:48] <%PeteRocca> It still slaps.
[0:00:57] <leith_aziz> Well, if you dont wanna support DLC as a practice, I wont stop you. But if I like what I'm seeing and it doesn't come off as ripping me off, I while consider the offer cohhHmm
[0:01:00] <dds333a> It would be cool at least if it gravitated more towards an expansion pack, but even that doesn't jive with me
[0:01:05] <leith_aziz> Anyway, let's go pickyLurk
[0:01:05] <DingusMcBaseball> if rather have DLC than whatever  SF4 was doing

[0:06:02] <%Irridium> Hey I'm here on Playstation Kappa
[0:06:06] <+LastHazzerd> LUL
[0:06:10] <FrostedZaibatsu> Yeah Elden Ring stutters like a MFer
[0:06:11] <Treasure_Vault> PCs are the best, except for all of their many many problems
[0:06:14] <leith_aziz> I saw Cohh's stream. First hours were WOOF
[0:06:15] <%PeteRocca> Stutter City.
[0:06:16] <+punchdrunk_donkeybooy> nice timing bot!
[0:06:16] <%andre11dr> ARTESIAN SPONSORSHIPS, REMOVED
[0:06:17] <Irishgamerlawd> Heard the trolls are back in force too lol
[0:06:22] <+LastHazzerd> PS5 has the worst save issue
[0:06:28] <@Solidus_113> it's only having problems for people on high-end PCs
[0:06:29] <leith_aziz> Delay Based Netcode PTSD cohhM
[0:06:38] <@Solidus_113> I'm sitting here on at GTX 1060 fine
[0:06:40] <+ikantreeed> Are the DS games back online?
[0:06:41] <+LastHazzerd> DO NOT GO INTO REST MODE on PS5
[0:06:54] <FrostedZaibatsu> I heard about invisible enemies too.. man
[0:06:58] <+LastHazzerd> you WILL lose save data
[0:07:01] <%RyTYoung> YEAH CONSOLE 4 LYF
[0:07:02] <dds333a> CONSOLE STAY WINNING Kappa
[0:07:06] <Treasure_Vault> Just hate on the PC.
[0:07:08] <$Kekon3> You get a luck of the draw that the game don’t mess up for you
[0:07:10] <leith_aziz> Im with Reggie. PC supremacy pickyStronk
[0:07:38] <+LastHazzerd> Woolie DOES know about the save bug on PS5 right?
[0:07:52] <dds333a> they sure do
[0:07:53] <%andre11dr> I mean Ive been playing on PC there's some weird framedrops ,everything else seems ok
[0:08:00] <Treasure_Vault> As someone who is trying to fix a non-starting laptop, PC has problems and you gotta get your hands dirty
[0:08:08] <SirPickelchips> also depends if the game comes from japan
[0:08:18] <%andre11dr> Buy yeah fighting games on pc can be rough
[0:08:20] <leith_aziz> I cant help but feel PC ports should always be prioritised to soem extent. They're the ones that stick around while newer consoles get built and you gotta make new ports or "remasters" cohhSus
[0:09:01] <Irishgamerlawd> rundown the actual issue rn again?
[0:09:01] <FrostedZaibatsu> Yeah, i was trying to fix the Stutter on Elden Ring. Updated my GPU drives and my screen went black atpFeelsBeardMan atpFeelsBeardMan
[0:09:01] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:09:14] <nintega010> Ps4 KOF is what I'm gonna be
[0:09:15] <Treasure_Vault> My GPU exploded a month ago. Perfect timing.
[0:09:16] <leith_aziz> Most people on Strive are actually from the PC playerbase. Ever since the start. Interesting juxtaposition
[0:09:17] <tolloponik> I also don't want to pay 50 extra bucks a year to play online
[0:09:20] <Evilpuppys> get a pc
[0:09:23] <%Irridium> LUL
[0:09:26] <enerkaizer> The PS5 is turning 4 this year, right? and still many people couldn't get their hands on that console still. insane
[0:09:30] <leith_aziz> Strive PC mods doodOK
[0:09:31] <%townzzzzz> eat ya worlds Kappa
[0:09:49] <dds333a> I'm in the same camp as LJB, only got PS4, PC, and a goddamn Switch. that's stuff "this gen"
[0:09:54] <leith_aziz> SFV 8 frame input lag (at the start) cohhM
[0:10:00] <+LastHazzerd> PS5 has issues. if Elden Ring is on while the PS5 goes into Rest mode you will lose the save data for that session
[0:10:03] <%andre11dr> What a chaotic start
[0:10:09] <dds333a> Kappa
[0:10:14] <%andre11dr> It's going fine i guess
[0:10:20] <%andre11dr> Not really tho
[0:10:20] <J33P3R5_CR33P3R> Oh baby, time to listen to Galactica Phantoms and hype screams at work Kappa
[0:10:22] <FrostedZaibatsu> Im still enjoying Elden Ring thought. Bout 8 hours in
[0:10:27] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Nintendo said No Smash Ultimate
[0:10:29] <%townzzzzz> they got rid of the smell
[0:10:29] <@Squdnate> the imput lag is more severely on PS4/PS5 with KOF15. The PC version so far only has problems regarding vsync and it locking your region search to your Windows Settings. No joke. The Xbox version of KOF15 is the best version
[0:10:30] <leith_aziz> Can someone fill me in? cohhNotes
[0:10:33] <$Kekon3> @leith_aziz Or at least eventually the port gets patches, patches on pc can be forever
[0:10:34] <+Jiggisnipe> @enerkaizer came out November 2020
[0:10:34] <dds333a> Speak up chat Kappa
[0:10:41] <%Dr00_PhD> no smash. game annoujncement on march 8th

[0:11:49] <kadjah> between the kirby headphones and glasses, this is the coolest stream on twitch
[0:11:50] <dds333a> LUL
[0:11:51] <Irishgamerlawd> the hidden issue with post release content. .devs get burnt out on it so the wait is extended for sequels etc
[0:11:53] <%jinking79> evo online  said nope
[0:11:56] <%Irridium> Ms. Mayne
[0:11:56] <RodCU> Leave it to a Glacius main CoolCat
[0:11:58] <randomdude365> RIP Smash
[0:12:01] <%andre11dr> Damn ,that looks like a leader
[0:12:04] <Treasure_Vault> Pokimon?
[0:12:06] <$Jbulleit97> Will we be seeing Kyo combos today? I’m trying and failing to learn.
[0:12:07] <+Jiggisnipe> ikr when Sony bought EVO, everyone said guess Smash is gone
[0:12:09] <leith_aziz> I dont know anything about Pokimane, but this guy does seem dope pickyShrug
[0:12:13] <@Solidus_113> LUL

[0:12:17] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[0:12:18] <$Kekon3> Aight cool, put rivals on EVO main stage instead :)
[0:12:19] <%PeteRocca> The fear in the eyes.
[0:12:20] <Carlioo> wipe the slate clean
[0:12:23] <@Solidus_113> "get fucked lmao"
[0:12:24] <dds333a> FUCK ALL Y'ALL, says Reg

[0:12:27] <%AlteisenReiseZ> VoteYea LUL
[0:12:30] <+Jiggisnipe> RIPBOZO
[0:12:31] <RodCU> I'll take Rivals over Smash
[0:12:38] <+LastHazzerd> rocky start, pathetic end
[0:12:47] <leith_aziz> Im pretty Meta Knight was the joke cohhHmm
[0:12:48] <dds333a> LUL
[0:12:56] <%andre11dr> Keeping the Melty players out of the bathrooms but they got replaced with Melee players

[0:13:39] <%Th3SmartAlec> We doing those buff mods today Kappa
[0:13:39] <%notsoy> onto better games lmfao
[0:13:47] <kadjah> wake up
[0:13:48] <+Jiggisnipe> yea
[0:13:51] <%andre11dr> That's not happening
[0:13:53] <+Jiggisnipe> Smash don't need EVO
[0:13:59] <+Jiggisnipe> it should do it's own thing
[0:14:04] <leith_aziz> Nintendo shoots itself in the foot. That's mostly it
[0:14:17] <%Th3rd3> actually, Nintendo never slept
[0:14:26] <Carlioo> smash doesn't need evo, but it's still disappointing
[0:14:31] <dds333a> I legit don't think Ninty will ever care
[0:14:31] <%Th3rd3> that why they did what they did
[0:14:34] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Smash has tons of their own events. Shine, Big House, etc. They'll definitely survive
[0:14:36] <RodCU> and whenever nintendo is involved in an event they mostly hinder the community
[0:14:37] <+Jiggisnipe> Nintendo hates the Smash community, they want them to die
[0:14:51] <%notsoy> and why should they, smash has made them so much money without ever needing to touch esports
[0:14:54] <dds333a> They don't care about any bad will, or otherwise
[0:15:00] <Irishgamerlawd> Ninja thumb?
[0:15:00] <leith_aziz> Oh wait, is your thumb ok, Woolie?
[0:15:03] <%andre11dr> Nintendo probably thinks Smash tournaments are held by warlords with hookers and blackjack
[0:15:07] <leith_aziz> cohhO
[0:15:49] <%ekodrop> espn is ded tho

[0:23:02] <dds333a> @rodcu or a one, Señor Nanakase
[0:23:02] <leith_aziz> @marcomatame That's pretty natural. It happened when MBTL came out, then the playerbase went back to skyrocketing. I wouldnt worry anymore cohhNotes
[0:23:10] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> But don’t drown in the drip
[0:23:15] <%andre11dr> Like just step on Vanessa's feet as hard as you can, fight over

[0:23:50] <leith_aziz> Noooo, I hate training stages pickySad
[0:23:54] <leith_aziz> Oh well
[0:23:58] <dds333a> @taliskanju the issue being that she uses to wear boots, for those that dislike it
[0:24:00] <Daxalog> Impractical is cool
[0:24:03] <%townzzzzz> one day stages will have stable framerates
[0:24:04] <dds333a> *used
[0:24:06] <%PeteRocca> Haha it's Game Not Optimized Month.
[0:24:14] <Daxalog> I can feel each of the hitches.
[0:24:20] <+armormog> rtx apparently causes an issue
[0:24:48] <AverageHanzo> Try turning off depth of field in graphics settings

[0:24:55] <odd_slater> NotLikeThis

[0:27:57] <dds333a> The EX LUL
[0:28:13] <Daxalog> Was that a screen tear grab?
[0:28:26] <smamgotdam> I missed the beginning of the stream, who’s their guest?
[0:28:27] <%Shad0wTag> I'm late guys what I miss so far?
[0:28:30] <dds333a> @daxalog yeah, it grabs the screen itself
[0:28:40] <dds333a> @smamgotdam lord jimmybones
[0:28:44] <smamgotdam> Thanks
[0:28:47] <+slayabee> Screen tearing is a known PC port issue chat
[0:29:28] <odd_slater> I believe so but PC has the least input delay
[0:29:33] <%UnrealStyrofoam> zfiestBop celina8Woop
[0:29:59] <dds333a> LUL
[0:30:01] <bigshedman> Do it
[0:30:06] <%townzzzzz> LUL
[0:30:43] <%andre11dr> So apparently it's called Indonesian gamelan
[0:30:44] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:31:07] <dds333a> @andre11dr neat
[0:31:35] <%andre11dr> Damn there's a huge page about the Akira music
[0:31:38] <dds333a> Does it tend to have vocals, because the music had all those ethereal vocals too
[0:32:00] <nintega010> @dds333a its the other one
[0:32:31] <+OroOreo> Dp with 3 reflects fireballs
[0:32:36] <%andre11dr> Apparently they mixed it with Japanese Noh music
[0:32:42] <+OroOreo> I mean C
[0:32:45] <odd_slater> The XIV boss theme sounded even more like Akira than this
[0:33:00] <dds333a> @andre11dr that stands to reason, yeah
[0:33:11] <@Menitta> Ey yo made it for this GIFG
[0:33:27] <%Shad0wTag> Me too!
[0:34:22] <nintega010> rolls are very punishable
[0:34:34] <dds333a> nobody knows what to do with Clark Kappa
[0:34:37] <@Squdnate> @WoolieVersus Have you forced the game to use vsync through changing ini files?

[0:37:23] <dds333a> almost jumped back into it LUL
[0:37:37] <shinichizio> The honorable thing to do ofc
[0:37:38] <+silent__chief> this gameplay looks so much better than the trailers
[0:37:46] <RodCU> LUL
[0:37:46] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:37:49] <+silent__chief> crappy marketing
[0:38:06] <+MyshkaMysh> \o/ Woo! Victory!
[0:38:19] <%AlteisenReiseZ> ! WOOLIE AT RISK !
[0:38:31] <+FoxLex_> oh nobody told Woolie about the input delay fix on PC beforehand
[0:38:42] <BlackermanZX> iirc its very easy to change on the ini file
[0:38:48] <%Shad0wTag> Oh man I didnt know  it was so bad tonight
[0:38:52] <+gridib> Max has also fixed screen tearing by forcing it through nvidias panel cause the .ini trick didn't work for him.
[0:39:22] <@Squdnate> @WoolieVersus It's actually quite fast and easy. Windows + R to get the run command, then %LOCALAPPDATA%\KOFXV\Saved\Config\WindowsNoEditor find the finel called GamerUserSettings.ini and change bUseVSync=False to True
[0:39:52] <@Squdnate> It's some janky stuff to do, but what can you expect from SNK
[0:40:19] <+silent__chief> NotLikeThis SNK why
[0:40:22] <dds333a> SUPER ARGENTINR
[0:40:41] <RodCU> niice
[0:41:02] <dds333a> That Diving Puncher
[0:41:07] <Who_lio42> im glad woolie modded her good pants back on but i think theres one with the boots now too
[0:41:30] <nintega010> That's not a mod that's in the game
[0:41:38] <%Shad0wTag> Its not a mod
[0:42:19] <odd_slater> Last color palette iirc
[0:42:40] <dds333a> YAY
[0:42:47] <BlackermanZX> galactica choke
[0:43:27] <odd_slater> Punished Woolie
[0:43:49] <odd_slater> Faded? majinoBronny
[0:44:07] <orpleborple> woolie modded out the mom clothes for classic vannessa?
[0:44:09] <dds333a> And then you excise it? LUL
[0:44:23] <odd_slater> @orpleborple No
[0:44:26] <nintega010> @orpleborple no there a color in the game
[0:44:42] <orpleborple> ah ok
[0:45:07] <nintega010> also Reggie needs to remember you can combo into cmd grab with clark
[0:45:08] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1495994438551851008?t=MtwwBoXiBdU6LlIYk0i-Kw&s=19
[0:45:22] <dds333a> and then just build on top?
[0:45:35] <nintega010> KOF hitconfirm is important
[0:46:02] <%Juriasu> the fast that fighting games are a learning experience is my favorite part of these games
[0:46:02] <dds333a> every interaction LUL
[0:47:19] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> That’s what I had with Angel
[0:47:23] <dds333a> LIB is straight to the point, I dig it LUL
[0:47:27] <%UnrealStyrofoam> Yeah so people just wanna use whatever is easy/works without experimenting to find something new
[0:47:33] <%Sparkseid> nope
[0:47:34] <%ekodrop> no
[0:47:39] <%Juriasu> vsync is probably always on?
[0:47:55] <%Juriasu> oh weird
[0:47:58] <%ekodrop> it may or may not work
[0:48:10] <+SneakyBeaver102> Those Kirby headphones are sick
[0:48:12] <@Squdnate> The PC Port is jank. I got it working fine on my end, but it can vary, that's PC gaming for ya. Love and hate it haha
[0:48:29] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> Took a lot of playing here to realize she’s entirely “do combo” and get used to adapting to the player more than “learning the best combo”
[0:48:38] <DingusMcBaseball> thats all on the developers, not PC gaming
[0:48:43] <odd_slater> @sneakybeaver102 He's possessing Woolie
[0:48:43] <%Juriasu> thankfully control panel will fix most things the game can't
[0:48:48] <+gridib> If the .ini trick doesn't work you can just force it through your gpu's control panel
[0:48:51] <DingusMcBaseball> crazy how half assed ports are common
[0:49:04] <+SneakyBeaver102> Ohh shit you’re right! Sneaky sneak! @odd_slater
[0:49:21] <@Squdnate> @gridib It differs from machine to machine.
[0:49:33] <%DaRoosta89> Ight boys show us how to play KOF
[0:49:36] <RodCU> I always go for  B C D on the top row and A two punches and two kicks for the macros
[0:49:36] <%ekodrop> i think part of the issue was people seeing screen tearing on the stream side and not on the streamer side.
[0:49:42] <odd_slater> Yeah Kirby is in Woolie mode right now Woolie isn't actually talking
[0:49:48] <RodCU> I do the same thing!
[0:49:53] <+gridib> @Squdnate Very true
[0:49:55] <RodCU> spark in the forth button
[0:50:14] <BlackermanZX> Garou Terry yeyeye
[0:50:27] <dds333a> The best Terry
[0:50:45] <+SneakyBeaver102> Kirby is going to sweep these guys and they don’t even know it
[0:50:59] <nintega010> yeah this is the one
[0:51:11] <@Squdnate> Damn it, it still does the slowdowns
[0:51:17] <@Squdnate> Hm
[0:51:30] <dds333a> kochi kochi
[0:51:31] <nintega010> in max chat people was just in chat singing the song

[0:52:34] <dds333a> I only have one extremely minor complaint about Heidern. the wetsuit is cool, but I do slightly prefer the uniform itself

[0:55:28] <dds333a> Woolie-1 and Woolie-2
[0:55:36] <Carlioo> who's the KUSANAGI version of woolie

[0:57:05] <benjisonfire> vanessa is so badass
[0:57:06] <dds333a> @andre11dr "Nightmare Woolie" LUL
[0:57:12] <Carlioo> as long as we don't find god woolie, I don't think we can handle that
[0:57:12] <jimgimp> Reminds me of the Zone of Enders theme
[0:57:19] <%DaRoosta89> woolieF offline lag spike
[0:57:27] <enerkaizer> Woolie, Scarlet-Woolie, Woolie-abel and Woolie-cide. What an amazing set of 4 heavyenly woolie clone kings
[0:57:43] <benjisonfire> sounds like something yoko kanno would make
[0:58:04] <jimgimp> Im not familier with kanno, but i do know ono

[0:59:20] <%andre11dr> Of course Woolie showed you to boss
[0:59:26] <%Reverend_Roscoe> if you hear music in an anime that you like,  Kanno probably wrote it
[0:59:29] <%andre11dr> He would've picked it too
[0:59:30] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Carlioo
[0:59:32] <dds333a> @who_lio42 I was gonna say, Susumu Hirasawa does sound similar
[0:59:56] <dds333a> But it isn't entirely Hirasawa, I don't think
[1:00:30] <nintega010> yeah ya'll forgot all about shatter strike
[1:00:43] <%andre11dr> This music also reminds me of the music in that one Tekken 6 stage
[1:01:02] <odd_slater> The colony stage?
[1:01:14] <nintega010> woolie always cancel at the wrong times
[1:01:22] <%andre11dr> The one with perpendicular gardens ,where you fall through the glass
[1:01:30] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> 90% of ost: remixes, rock and roll with some electronic versions
[1:01:31] <jimgimp> Electric Fountain is the GOAT for that game in my opinion
[1:01:31] <odd_slater> With the jets in the back
[1:01:35] <RodCU> but Woolie, the vision
[1:01:50] <odd_slater> GYAAAT
[1:01:50] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> This stage?: Polish throat singing

[1:01:51] <RodCU> how dare you ruin the vision LUL
[1:02:02] <+dr_steve1790> The mud is beautiful Woolie quit playing.
[1:02:11] <nintega010> Have to be good at KOF to really play her
[1:02:43] <%andre11dr> That caracter was ruined when someone called her a poo mender
[1:02:47] <Who_lio42> the effects in this game are kiinda eh

[1:20:29] <Doublemint_Dave_> Clark is THE grappler PogChamp
[1:20:29] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:20:31] <dds333a> Clark is scary
[1:20:50] <+0neReeler> grapplers in snk can move and combo throws
[1:20:51] <dds333a> he's always had a ton of goddamn moves
[1:20:54] <BlackermanZX> the coolest guy
[1:20:54] <RodCU> I need a Chip Hazard Mod for Clark
[1:21:00] <%andre11dr> He just gets so many tools

[1:21:24] <nintega010> family man
[1:21:33] <Elykial> i miss freeman from garou
[1:21:43] <Norrdicus> To a point. Dino has very slow running speed
[1:21:46] <dds333a> @rodcu Are you scared, we all are, you would have to be crazy not to be scared
[1:22:01] <VirtuallyCanadian> he knows the secret moves!
[1:22:22] <RodCU> @dds333a how does that affect the Gorgonites?
[1:22:26] <@Squdnate> Aight, i have an early appointment tomorrow and it's like almost 11pm my time. Sucks that it's not running smoothly for you Woolie. Ggs and good night

[1:24:27] <dds333a> YO NIPPON ICHI
[1:24:39] <%andre11dr> Iori got the switch side move, Kyo got the explosion
[1:24:40] <%AlteisenReiseZ> OOF
[1:24:42] <nintega010> @J33P3R5_CR33P3R to much jumping not enough hopping
[1:25:07] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> Exactly
[1:25:07] <+0neReeler> iori and solbadguy same school
[1:25:26] <%townzzzzz> middle is the waiting line
[1:25:33] <%Shad0wTag> KOF's answer to most things is just give them a command grab
[1:25:52] <+0neReeler> crazy rushdown charcter? here's a grab that you can combo after
[1:26:03] <%andre11dr> Remember in 13 when they made Kyos explosion a for real comand grab if you EX'd LUL
[1:26:07] <VirtuallyCanadian> spending more time in the corner than pancho villa
[1:26:18] <dds333a> @andre11dr LUL LUL SeemsGood
[1:26:47] <+0neReeler> he has it again in xv - ex real grab

[1:31:54] <RodCU> yeah Unreal Engine
[1:32:05] <Drunkengen> Metal Slug? or Last Blade??
[1:32:16] <Elykial> last blade would be cool
[1:32:20] <dweebenheimer20> either a new Metal Slug or something
[1:32:29] <RodCU> Are you telling me that SNK made no money out of the Pachinkos? NotLikeThis
[1:32:37] <+0neReeler> a good 3d metal slug? dunno
[1:32:39] <RodCU> Unreal Engine Pachinko game

[1:33:31] <Elykial> theres a lot of garou stuff packed into XV so maybe a garou 2, i can hope.
[1:33:34] <+0neReeler> probably fatal fury featuring neo mr karate
[1:33:38] <nintega010> people you need to get in the middle to line up
[1:34:05] <RodCU> just make it into a hyper game
[1:34:07] <dds333a> quite
[1:34:10] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> Honestly after SoR4 slapped, I’d kill for an SNK beat-em-up

[1:34:19] <dds333a> Woolz seething Kappa
[1:34:27] <dweebenheimer20> @J33P3R5_CR33P3R aof 4 beat em up style

[1:35:10] <dds333a> a more in depth ms LUL
[1:35:21] <Drunkengen> FPS or Third Person Metal Slug?
[1:35:27] <+0neReeler> they already tried metal slug 3d shooter but were bad maybe ps2/ps3 era
[1:35:33] <Elykial> they'll promote the new metal slug with a metal slug team for XV, calling it.
[1:35:36] <dds333a> MOETARO
[1:35:48] <RodCU> new IP maybe?
[1:36:05] <%Shad0wTag> Isnt there metal slug tactics coming?

[1:36:27] <dds333a> SPIDER
[1:36:30] <dweebenheimer20> My heart wishes for a new Fatal Fury (garou 2) but the realistic option would be a new Metal Slug
[1:36:35] <+cubbywolf> does anyone else have trouble enjoying gaming with war in ukrain, or am I just too soft?
[1:36:53] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> And the altars where you get your buffs for your runs could have stuff like zombiefication  or stuff like that
[1:37:03] <%andre11dr> @cubbywolf Distractions help
[1:37:17] <dds333a> @cubbywolf definitely the latter Kappa
[1:37:22] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> @cubbywolf I mean life has to continue, can’t stop everything
[1:37:25] <+cubbywolf> LUL
[1:37:47] <+0neReeler> i mean, even our leaders aren't doing much..
[1:37:48] <dds333a> CLOSER
[1:37:52] <+zanz_san> bmary has great normals and counters to short hop
[1:37:52] <RodCU> thats not a bad shun ei alt
[1:38:10] <%andre11dr> I'm really close to that shit too
[1:38:11] <+cubbywolf> oof
[1:38:18] <+BeyondWalt3> O O F
[1:38:19] <dds333a> SHITTO
[1:38:19] <+cubbywolf> thats some delay like lag
[1:38:21] <+0neReeler> rasputin get those hands
[1:38:29] <RodCU> Ramón
[1:38:33] <Haarute> VIVA MÉXICO
[1:38:49] <+cubbywolf> nice
[1:38:51] <+zanz_san> yup
[1:38:53] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> *Strongest man in Mexico
[1:38:55] <RodCU> I hope to see a Mexican character that is not a wrestler in SF6
[1:38:55] <$Jbulleit97> gg
[1:38:58] <RodCU> or a grapler rhater
[1:39:00] <Drunkengen> yes it does
[1:39:06] <Drunkengen> but not much
[1:39:07] <+zanz_san> raw climax would hurt more
[1:39:16] <RodCU> rather**. Mexico has a pretty rich history in boxing, hope we get something like that in SF6
[1:39:30] <Who_lio42> auto combos dont have extra scaling @WoolieVersus
[1:39:31] <%andre11dr> Hopefully SF6 doesn't just look like Capcom hired that man
[1:39:35] <+0neReeler> the worst climax
[1:39:43] <+cubbywolf> raw lvl 3, aka whatever country the user is from lvl 3
[1:39:43] <RodCU> Boberto
[1:40:00] <RodCU> I love Robert's combos in XIII, they look so stylish
[1:40:00] <+cubbywolf> 1st season of dbfz with double supers was crazy
[1:40:04] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> Yeah there’s a couple of those and that kinda can’t fly anymore
[1:40:08] <hecticsketcher> detroit level 3
[1:40:11] <dds333a> Mr Garcia is sick
[1:40:12] <%andre11dr> Kid Buu is mad good
[1:40:13] <+cubbywolf> all my combos from day 1 are useless
[1:40:21] <%Giothegame> Yo is that LordJimmy Bones?
[1:40:22] <+zanz_san> zoners everywhere
[1:40:22] <dds333a> IKKIMASE
[1:40:35] <+0neReeler> 21 top tier finally
[1:40:38] <+cubbywolf> just give me dbfz 2
[1:40:50] <%andre11dr> Namco is at fault with that one
[1:40:55] <+cubbywolf> to be fair, for mony grubbing assholes, making a 2nd game makes more sense then updating the old one
[1:41:02] <+gridib> Robert feels so good to play in this game. He's got pretty much everything
[1:41:03] <%Shad0wTag> Not if Harada stops them
[1:41:08] <onirusha> i love the iori design
[1:41:11] <%andre11dr> I just hope Xrd gets Rollback, that would be crazy
[1:41:15] <onirusha> he looks amazing
[1:41:17] <%Irridium> Bamco won't fix Tekken or Soul Calibur why would they do DBFZ
[1:41:19] <+0neReeler> 13 was kinda like that too iirc, all dlc were top
[1:41:19] <%Shad0wTag> THE PERFECT SHOTO
[1:41:20] <dds333a> @cubbywolf I will always prefer this, yeah
[1:41:28] <dds333a> Scum Gale won that one LUL
[1:41:33] <%andre11dr> Xrd is one the best games ever that nobody played
[1:41:35] <Drunkengen> its robert garcia from kof
[1:41:36] <+cubbywolf> I wonder why they havent given xrd rollback. Maybe it would take heat from strive. I mean it def would for sure
[1:41:41] <RodCU> @Shad0wTag nah, the perfect shoto is Kazuya Kappa
[1:41:52] <+cubbywolf> the perfect shoto is W I D E
[1:41:52] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1495994438551851008?t=MtwwBoXiBdU6LlIYk0i-Kw&s=19
[1:41:56] <%Shad0wTag> what
[1:42:03] <RodCU> oh you didn't hear?

[1:42:13] <dds333a> W I D E and B E A R D
[1:42:22] <+cubbywolf> W I D E and H O B O
[1:42:33] <%andre11dr> He also found slippers
[1:42:45] <Who_lio42> mai was in doa twice
[1:42:51] <%andre11dr> He stole them from Akuma
[1:42:57] <dds333a> It was 6a, and that's been the recover standard since before '02
[1:43:02] <dds333a> Christ
[1:43:09] <Drunkengen> DP
[1:43:11] <+cubbywolf> hobo with a shotgun? no thanks, I'll have hobo with a hadoken
[1:43:27] <+cubbywolf> mmm combos
[1:43:32] <dds333a> DONAI YA
[1:43:34] <+0neReeler> was it an upper, thought robert had like a backfist?
[1:43:44] <VirtuallyCanadian> he paid for mugen sprite data hitboxes
[1:43:45] <+cubbywolf> take that king
[1:43:46] <dds333a> @0nereeler he had both
[1:43:54] <+zanz_san> GG Reggie let's go
[1:43:57] <dds333a> When he does Ryuuko Ranbu, he combines them
[1:43:59] <onirusha> Great fight !
[1:44:06] <%andre11dr> Remember when they decided to turn Robert into Guile? That was stupid
[1:44:07] <%townzzzzz> get in guys
[1:44:15] <onirusha> Reggie's got the moves
[1:44:31] <%AlteisenReiseZ> maaan that cross up
[1:44:40] <+0neReeler> he was decent in those games not as good though
[1:44:56] <dds333a> @0nereeler yeah, LUL
[1:44:58] <%AlteisenReiseZ> i'll probably split from the room to give people more space
[1:45:18] <+cubbywolf> two sexy ladies and a dude
[1:45:18] <dds333a> one of Robert's best moves is the divekick tho
[1:45:24] <Slime_Roy> shermieeeeeeee doodThirst doodDrool
[1:45:24] <+cubbywolf> ive seen that anime
[1:45:26] <+gridib> Shermie <3

[1:45:47] <brunoberserk> its woolie already talked about smash out of evo ?

[1:46:02] <VirtuallyCanadian> watching yall hits that gathering around the cabinet feel ive been missing
[1:46:10] <+0neReeler> 99-2001..?
[1:46:12] <dds333a> @alteisenreisez SHERUMIE HI
[1:46:29] <+cubbywolf> moth got the spacing
[1:46:37] <+cubbywolf> until they didnt
[1:46:40] <dds333a> LUL
[1:46:46] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> An Angel eh? You have my attention…
[1:47:05] <Slime_Roy> angel! doodThirst
[1:47:36] <dds333a> MA WATE
[1:47:52] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> I am the Angel inspector. Even though I can’t play her either, I will critique your Angel play
[1:47:57] <+zanz_san> orochi Chris is terrifying
[1:48:02] <dds333a> Orochi Chris is busted
[1:48:14] <+cubbywolf> finally? LUL
[1:48:15] <dds333a> his fucking insane fireball super
[1:48:31] <Haarute> i miss kyo's NESTS look
[1:48:33] <%andre11dr> Angel players are the type of dudes to wash their hands after showering
[1:48:40] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> Sorry man, that Angel was lackin
[1:48:43] <dds333a> @haarute we all do
[1:49:00] <+zanz_san> love that pose
[1:49:00] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:49:01] <dds333a> @andre11dr LUL LUL
[1:49:06] <dds333a> YAY
[1:49:36] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> @andre11dr I’ve been practicing her and get her, but I’m an offline player. So I basically have no real Angel experience. But I understand how she work, I just can’t execute
[1:50:31] <+0neReeler> all i know is angel has a sick crossup elbow
[1:50:34] <nintega010> Lordjimmybones you got ash loops?
[1:50:46] <dds333a> @0nereeler the classic LUL
[1:50:57] <%andre11dr> @j33p3r5_cr33p3r She's like playing Lee in Tekken, she's really good but you better be a execution machine
[1:51:02] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> Lotta low kick start-ups, tons of juggle potential, and a good anchor with meter
[1:51:26] <GeltonZ> Oh hey are they each playing one character or something?
[1:51:47] <C_AK_E__759> is anyone allowed to join the room?
[1:51:54] <%Shad0wTag> Yes
[1:51:59] <%andre11dr> @j33p3r5_cr33p3r For a second i read that as "tons of jiggle potential" LUL
[1:52:03] <+wmeldrum> glad to see the boys back at it again
[1:52:06] <Drunkengen> its on PC
[1:52:13] <%Shad0wTag> I believe you nee a room code
[1:52:27] <%Shad0wTag> It might need reposting
[1:52:42] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> @andre11dr The way I always put it is any other character has multiple tools (projectile, command grabs, DPs). She is entirely Unchain combo and ways to set up the Unchain Combo…and the people’s elbow counter
[1:52:52] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> @andre11dr Kappa
[1:52:58] <C_AK_E__759> room code should be visible from the lobby screen, I just don't want him getting mad at me if I join in
[1:53:10] <+wmeldrum> what platform are they on?
[1:53:17] <Drunkengen> PC for this time
[1:53:17] <C_AK_E__759> pc
[1:53:18] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> Definitely some jiggle potential there

[3:11:31] <marcomatame> Chris has them scrimblo-like boots from Kingdom Hearts. i like them
[3:11:36] <+Neerb25> That Chris super looks so disrespectful
[3:11:48] <JdotSweapA> Ralf FBOOT
[3:11:51] <JdotSweapA> *boot
[3:11:58] <gamefan6219> Does this game have an english mode, or no?
[3:12:09] <+Neerb25> The voices are all Japanese
[3:12:10] <Mr_Bop> no
[3:12:12] <dds333a> YAY
[3:12:20] <gulthrax> engrish mode
[3:12:40] <JdotSweapA> think they gave kof 12 english voices but that game didnt do too well so..
[3:12:41] <jeetkunedoughnut> Why would you ever wanna hear a non-Japanese Terry?
[3:12:43] <gamefan6219> hey look it's the guy from smash
[3:13:02] <gamefan6219> @jeetkunedoughnut there's one in maximum impact
[3:13:09] <Kenny_Riot> @jeetkunedoughnut Hahaha, Maximum Impact 1
[3:13:13] <jeetkunedoughnut> lame
[3:13:14] <+Neerb25> @gamefan6219 Shame this is the only game he'll be in at EVO
[3:13:17] <JdotSweapA> Toriya!
[3:13:39] <dds333a> LUL LUL
[3:13:51] <nintega010> I think the next thing reggie will need to practice is hops
[3:13:59] <gamefan6219> @WoolieVersus remember english terry in maximum impact?
[3:13:59] <JdotSweapA> fun fact. Japanese voice of Ryu is the same VA as Kukri. what great range!
[3:14:09] <dds333a> SUPER ARGENTINE
[3:14:25] <FrostedZaibatsu> Imagine Master Chef speaking Japanese
[3:14:27] <marcomatame> Do english voices really help bring normies into the game?
[3:14:30] <+Neerb25> Tekken has the best voice acting. Everyone speaks their own native language and magically understands each other.
[3:14:54] <marcomatame> @Neerb25 yeahhh, that VA decision is based
[3:15:09] <jeetkunedoughnut> facts
[3:15:16] <+leviting> bbtag letting you toggle by character is probably the second best
[3:15:16] <FrostedZaibatsu> @marcomatame Yeah. People like things they can relate to
[3:15:24] <jeetkunedoughnut> i remember losing my shit when i heard lei speaking cantonese
[3:15:32] <gulthrax> noice
[3:15:36] <Kenny_Riot> @Neerb25 That shit was weird in Tekken 5, because the story mode voices weren't the same as the fighting voices
[3:15:47] <gamefan6219> Ken with a hat
[3:16:14] <marcomatame> @FrostedZaibatsu idk, i find it weird that some people can't vibe with other languages
[3:16:18] <dds333a> Ralf with the backdash almost looked like he went into the background, Fatal Fury style
[3:16:19] <gamefan6219> R.I.P Ken with hat
[3:16:20] <Kenny_Riot> @leviting Street Fighter 4 & 5 do that, too
[3:16:40] <gulthrax> Ralf is the most powerful being in the universe
[3:16:41] <FrostedZaibatsu> You ever see those videos of people speak other people's languages. They eyes widen and they turn into a different person @marcomatame
[3:16:42] <+SLVRBAKSLPZ> Ralf has never not been a problem
[3:16:47] <gamefan6219> Is Terry american like Ken?
[3:17:00] <dds333a> @gamefan6219 what do you think? LUL
[3:17:05] <gamefan6219> and is clark from metal slug?
[3:17:20] <gamefan6219> @dds333a i'll take that as a yes
[3:17:23] <+Neerb25> Clark and Ralph are from Ikari Warriors, which is a super old top-down shooter
[3:17:29] <gulthrax> clark is from Steel Snail
[3:17:32] <jeetkunedoughnut> Yeah
[3:17:36] <gamefan6219> @Neerb25 But i think leona is from metal slug
[3:17:42] <dds333a> Ralf is from TNK III at that
[3:17:51] <marcomatame> @FrostedZaibatsu ooooh, guess i kinda get it, but i've never gotten a similar reaction to that from dubbed media.
[3:17:52] <dds333a> and leona is a kof original
[3:17:56] <Deko_> my game works fine but i cant find any matches at all for some reason
[3:18:07] <gamefan6219> did the mysic change?
[3:18:11] <gamefan6219> *music
[3:18:12] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:18:12] <+StooEsq> @gamefan6219 Clark's not from Metal Slug, but he, Ralf, and even Leona showed up in later Metal Slug games
[3:18:23] <dds333a> @gamefan6219 classic IKARI theme <3
[3:18:25] <+BeyondWalt3> @Neerb25 Leona is a KOF original, but she appears in Metal Slug
[3:18:36] <zepelinnn1> @Deko_ apparently your download region defines where you matchmake
[3:18:51] <zepelinnn1> so change that shit to your location if it doesnt match
[3:18:51] <nintega010> you can probably backdash torpedo
[3:19:01] <gamefan6219> @Neerb25 i thought she was from Metal slug, because their team name is Metal slug
[3:19:11] <jeetkunedoughnut> nah
[3:19:16] <jeetkunedoughnut> They're team Ikari
[3:19:22] <dds333a> @gamefan6219 that's not their team name LUL
[3:19:31] <gamefan6219> @dds333a my bad
[3:19:33] <jeetkunedoughnut> Team Metal Slug is Tarma, Marco, and third person
[3:19:40] <dds333a> Fio, ideally
[3:19:43] <gamefan6219> cute kirby plush
[3:19:46] <dds333a> Usually, actually
[3:20:02] <jeetkunedoughnut> Have they ever had Eri in KOF?
[3:20:08] <gamefan6219> ARE YOU OK
[3:20:09] <dds333a> Nope
[3:20:16] <jeetkunedoughnut> that's whack
[3:20:31] <gamefan6219> i can't tell who's playing
[3:20:46] <%andre11dr> Marco dose have a existing moveset,they could trow him in
[3:20:50] <+0neReeler> for ash you can do 2b 2a germinal caprice (a ver) supercancel sans-culotte
[3:20:51] <dds333a> Well, actually, counting cameos, she has been in, just not playable
[3:21:32] <gamefan6219> chris looks like 2010 justin bieber
[3:21:41] <jeetkunedoughnut> The upset would be Marco, Tarma, and Trevor from MSlug 4
[3:21:57] <dds333a> Yeah, Tung trained Terry and Andy as well LUL
[3:22:14] <+0neReeler> they gave that to yun after snk sued fighters history dev into oblivion
[3:22:18] <+Neerb25> I imagine if we got a Metal Slug team now, it'd be three of the Tactics characters
[3:22:18] <dds333a> But Meitenkun has DNA with him,
[3:22:19] <%andre11dr> Battle Colosseum was a fun game
[3:22:20] <jeetkunedoughnut> I'd like to see Heidern in Metal Slug
[3:22:46] <gulthrax> Vanessa fextraGasm fextraGasm fextraGasm
[3:22:50] <dds333a> from Sam Sho yeah
[3:22:51] <+0neReeler> *capcom and dataeast
[3:23:10] <%jinking79> NeoDio or Goodmen?
[3:23:13] <%andre11dr> Fuck Feo,bring back Mars People
[3:23:23] <gulthrax> fextraBongoes fextraBongoes fextraBongoes fextraBongoes fextraBongoes
[3:23:40] <+0neReeler> give shermie back the running knee
[3:23:47] <%andre11dr> Also bring back Mr Karate to break the game again
[3:23:51] <dds333a> @0nereeler YES
[3:24:28] <dds333a> Give Shermie back the Three Count too Kappa
[3:25:04] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Day 1000 of asking for Duck King back
[3:25:11] <dds333a> @jinking79 I love Neo Dio due to being an absolute Araki reference in every sense of the word
[3:25:13] <+0neReeler> they gave some similar to the character in gbvs

[3:25:18] <Daxalog> Is the audio delayed or is it my bluetooth headphones?
[3:25:23] <jeetkunedoughnut> Vanessa is probably my favorite KOF character to watch
[3:25:58] <+Neerb25> @Daxalog audio seems fine to me
[3:26:46] <dds333a> Diving Puncher hype
[3:27:43] <nintega010> the light cmd grab is combo
[3:27:52] <%andre11dr> Give Clark his stupid finisher back, the one where he catches you with his legs
[3:28:00] <dds333a> the approach Kreygasm
[3:28:18] <nintega010> yeah there you go reggie
[3:28:21] <dds333a> Super Argentine
[3:28:23] <%andre11dr> It looks so dumb, you practically fall into his nuts
[3:28:32] <dds333a> @andre11dr LUL LUL
[3:28:40] <BlackermanZX> Vanessa is so damn fun
[3:29:19] <gulthrax> kick him to death!
[3:29:20] <%andre11dr> God damn sleepy boy
[3:29:47] <%andre11dr> Who wanted him back, nobody
[3:29:52] <nintega010> I did
[3:29:54] <Nerdwarp112> Oh man I haven’t practiced in this game in a few days. Admittedly it’s because I played online for the first time and it made me realize how terrible I am against real people compared to the AI lol
[3:30:03] <orpleborple> sleepy boi best boi
[3:30:03] <dds333a> I love meitenkun, he's FANTASTIC
[3:30:19] <gulthrax> sleepy boi rulez
[3:30:24] <dds333a> Like XIV and XV Hero Team is only weak due to Shun'ei
[3:30:32] <BlackermanZX> goddamn this song goes IN around the last round mark
[3:30:38] <dds333a> Tung has always been cool, and Beni is Beni
[3:30:40] <%andre11dr> Honestly i really dislike most of the 14 new comers
[3:31:07] <nintega010> I like all of them. Wanted Nelson back, but oh well
[3:31:08] <DSD24> Dolores is a great addition in 15
[3:31:17] <jeetkunedoughnut> I've seen some amazing plays with Shun'Ei but it seems like you really gotta work with him
[3:31:26] <%andre11dr> The Chinese lady was cool, the one with the mask, and team Brazil was cool
[3:31:36] <DSD24> @andre11dr That was Miang right?
[3:31:36] <%andre11dr> The rest, no thanks
[3:31:59] <dds333a> Milan is very cool, yeah
[3:32:01] <+Neerb25> Hero Team in 16 should have Isla
[3:32:05] <dds333a> *Mian
[3:32:12] <%andre11dr> @dsd24 Bruh I'm so stoned, i ain't remembering that name LUL
[3:32:14] <orpleborple> id like to see mian return but its probably unlikely
[3:32:14] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:32:24] <DSD24> I checked it was Mian yeah
[3:32:32] <gulthrax> nice read, playa
[3:32:33] <DSD24> Added a g by accident
[3:32:58] <fuji_n2> meiteikun putting em to sleep KEKW
[3:33:02] <Nerdwarp112> I’m glad that Antonov, Luong, and Kukri returned. I kind of liked Hein as well, so I think it’d be cool to see him return. At least he does show up in one of the endings.
[3:33:04] <dds333a> LUL LUL
[3:33:05] <+StooEsq> The Sleeper Has Awakened
[3:33:17] <%andre11dr> Who was the idol girl? She was just THE WORST
[3:33:18] <DSD24> Luong is really cool
[3:33:23] <%Shad0wTag> I'd love a team italy one day with some new characters
[3:33:29] <%Sparkseid> Reggie...
[3:33:31] <DSD24> @andre11dr Sylvie Paula Paula
[3:33:32] <dds333a> DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY
[3:33:33] <Nerdwarp112> @andre11dr Sylvie
[3:33:38] <+Xero_J> I want to see Alice come back, mostly cause I just thought she was cute
[3:33:52] <+Neerb25> bring back American Sports Team
[3:34:01] <dds333a> @nerdwarp112 agreed 1000%
[3:34:17] <dds333a> Kukri was always gonna return because he's plot relevant, though
[3:34:37] <%andre11dr> Yeah, never bring Sylvie back, erase her from existence like you did with Ash
[3:35:03] <dds333a> @andre11dr let's hope it sticks LUL
[3:35:33] <DSD24> I like this song
[3:36:05] <DSD24> Oooof was that the game?
[3:36:05] <orpleborple> i wonder if there'll be a team crazy people with sylvie and xanadu. dont know who'd be the third member
[3:36:15] <%andre11dr> Damn ,I'm looking at a picture of the 14 roaster, i genuinely forgot about the dude with the blue beard
[3:36:17] <nintega010> Xanadu was fun I liked him
[3:36:18] <+Xero_J> Man, while I'm thinking about it, if the Kim team isn't one of the DLCs I'm gonna be real surprised
[3:36:28] <%Shad0wTag> Team crackhead
[3:36:32] <%andre11dr> Good that dude was so stupid LUL
[3:36:34] <Nerdwarp112> Oh yeah Xanadu was interesting

[3:37:10] <orpleborple> @Shad0wTag i read that in the announcer's voice
[3:37:37] <nintega010> @Neerb25 was the 2nd characcter set leaked? who were they
[3:37:39] <%andre11dr> The new chick was cool tho ,i don't think Ive ever seen her ,i guess she was DLC
[3:37:59] <dds333a> Najd?
[3:38:08] <DSD24> Najd had that cool red hood
[3:38:24] <Nerdwarp112> I never played her but she had a good design
[3:38:25] <DSD24> She was a fan design I think
[3:38:33] <%andre11dr> Yeah, she was a fan design right
[3:38:42] <nintega010> yes
[3:38:59] <+Neerb25> @nintega010 Not sure if some people would consider it spoilers, but if you Google "kof xv dlc leak" the first result is a Reddit post from two months ago
[3:39:00] <Nerdwarp112> It would be cool if they did a fan design thing again for 15
[3:39:50] <%andre11dr> So in conclusion, 14 had like 4 cool newcomers out of like 13 LUL
[3:39:50] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1495994438551851008?t=MtwwBoXiBdU6LlIYk0i-Kw&s=19
[3:40:09] <DSD24> @andre11dr What about that cool Zarina lady with the flowers
[3:40:17] <+Neerb25> @nintega010 It leaked the last base characters and first two dlc waves before they were revealed, so the rest is probably true too
[3:40:18] <%andre11dr> Actually 5 ,Kim's wife is also fine
[3:40:21] <gulthrax> is this stage in the Hell dimension or something?
[3:40:33] <nintega010> @Neerb25 I see
[3:40:47] <dds333a> @andre11dr how dare you, Kim is a married man LUL
[3:41:01] <DSD24> Luong isn't Kim's wife I think
[3:41:04] <+Neerb25> I don't hate it tbh, but I bet some people will be disappointed for specific reasons
[3:41:05] <Nerdwarp112> This is one of the boss stages I believe @gulthrax
[3:41:27] <nintega010> @DSD24 no that's gang il wife
[3:41:29] <%andre11dr> Wait, i thought Luong was Kim's wife
[3:41:30] <dds333a> @dsd24 exactly, how dare he imply Kim would ever be unfaithful LUL
[3:41:33] <Nerdwarp112> Luong was the lover of Kim’s master
[3:41:44] <dds333a> Kim IS married, but it's not Luong LUL
[3:41:52] <%andre11dr> @nerdwarp112 Thanks, i hate it
[3:41:58] <gulthrax> Kim is married to justice
[3:41:58] <Nerdwarp112> Lmao
[3:41:59] <DSD24> Kim's Wife was in that Fatal Fury Anime
[3:42:18] <jeetkunedoughnut> I love that Kim still looks like he's 25 and has grown-ass kids
[3:42:31] <dds333a> @nintega010 they're not married, either, they just hook up a lot
[3:43:04] <dr_doriah> yo wtf lmao
[3:43:06] <%andre11dr> Damn ,chat just ruined Luong for me with facts
[3:43:10] <nintega010> @dds333a well there lovers
[3:43:13] <dds333a> @jeetkunedoughnut remember when they showed up in the background of the Seoul stage LUL
[3:43:25] <jeetkunedoughnut> LUL
[3:43:27] <DSD24> @andre11dr Hey man Luong is still pretty cool
[3:43:43] <Nerdwarp112> Luong is still cool imo
[3:43:50] <dr_doriah> vanessa looks dope af
[3:43:54] <jeetkunedoughnut> Luong is great, she's a spy who sits on faces
[3:43:54] <dds333a> @nintega010 exactly, just not married
[3:44:09] <%andre11dr> Face siting is pretty cool
[3:44:11] <Nerdwarp112> @jeetkunedoughnut exactly lol
[3:44:23] <dds333a> Face sitting IS pretty cool
[3:44:30] <%Shad0wTag> It is cool
[3:44:35] <%andre11dr> Tho you gotta tell the girl to position right
[3:44:42] <DSD24> Plus she's got a eye for fashion since she complimented Dolores's jewelry
[3:44:50] <nintega010> I like Meitenkun level 3
[3:45:03] <%andre11dr> Face sit with precision, you know
[3:45:05] <DSD24> Punch the sleepy boy
[3:45:15] <%Shad0wTag> I'll die if goes poorly and  thats ok
[3:45:55] <nintega010> Meitenkun level 3 is great just yawns wakes up then beats you you up
[3:45:59] <dds333a> LUL
[3:46:18] <dds333a> Game
[3:46:41] <%andre11dr> Oh that's how it is

[3:47:32] <%andre11dr> Potato
[3:47:33] <+Neerb25> PC, though they're talking about regretting it
[3:47:43] <dds333a> @andre11dr might as well LUL
[3:47:46] <gruulmagebeast> why they regretting it?
[3:48:00] <KnivesEve> isn't the pc version the best one though?
[3:48:10] <DSD24> The spitethrough
[3:48:16] <%Th3SmartAlec> wude
[3:48:22] <Nerdwarp112> The pc version works well for me at least
[3:48:25] <dds333a> You can't just run up and go
[3:49:10] <%Shad0wTag> Best input delay but stuttering/screen tearing
[3:49:10] <+0neReeler> more hoping pressure
[3:49:16] <%andre11dr> @dds333a You can jump up and go tho
[3:49:29] <%Irridium> @KnivesEve in terms of input lag yes but it's region-locked based on windows regions and woolie's had tech problems with it this stream
[3:49:39] <%andre11dr> @dds333a Kyo gonna axe handle the shit out of you
[3:49:44] <KnivesEve> ooo. I see
[3:49:54] <dds333a> @andre11dr yep, overheads. but sometimes the overhead gets stuffed by Daimon LUL
[3:50:05] <%townzzzzz> mind tried
[3:50:14] <gruulmagebeast> why they dislike pc?
[3:50:15] <%Sparkseid> daaaaamn

[3:52:13] <%Irridium> wonder if SF6 being in RE engine will help it fair better
[3:52:14] <nintega010> Xbox don't have games I like to play why I just get ps4 and stuff
[3:52:15] <%Shad0wTag> I am willing to go back to xbox for fg's
