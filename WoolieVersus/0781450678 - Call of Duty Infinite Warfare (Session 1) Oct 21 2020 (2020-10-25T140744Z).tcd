[0:00:55] <%Solidnick18> yeah cause space guns
[0:00:55] <andre11dr> Why not the Future one?But not that one, the other one
[0:00:56] <BlackermanZX> damn
[0:00:57] <@Solidus_113> people were really tired of the hyper-future stuff by then
[0:00:58] <+SainEdge> oh wow LUL
[0:00:59] <+Rekinsinn> isnt it just military chuds tho
[0:01:01] <ralphfromdk> But... i though Woolie liked story in his games... This is so far away from even thinking it's close to Halo :l
[0:01:08] <%IronBagel1> People hated this game when it came out, the campaign is actually pretty good
[0:01:13] <puse9> wow that was a stretch
[0:01:13] <%doomerskeletor13> Why was it so disliked
[0:01:14] <%RioGascar> Wait call of duty?
[0:01:15] <%Solidnick18> the hardcore card people really hated this

[0:01:30] <derap41> Loot boxes tho
[0:01:31] <Darren716> Woolie that isnt what happened, people were just sick of the future stuff
[0:01:32] <+DakotaMacDoodle> Hey Woolie and V.
[0:01:33] <Ghostbody> not spacey
[0:01:35] <@Solidus_113> After Black Ops 2, Black Ops 3, and Advanced Warfare
[0:01:35] <CappuccinoGuil> Like RE6 is not as bad if it wasn't RE
[0:01:36] <%doomerskeletor13> Oh fuck is Spacey in this lmao
[0:01:37] <%CommanderSqueaks> Came for Apple Pie, and motherfuckers bring out Custard.
[0:01:41] <+Superbro64> I HATE CHANGE, ARRRRR Kappa
[0:01:42] <+michingmallecho> I never asked for this
[0:01:43] <Halospaz117> Advanced Warfare is the Spacey one
[0:01:43] <%JustYudha> John Snow is pretty good in this
[0:01:44] <amiavamp> its not cod if you can't sit in a corner with your mary jane ak
[0:01:45] <%ringabal> It's great if you forget the Call of Duty label
[0:01:46] <%Josef_Stryker> It's a really good campaign
[0:01:47] <xxmagonx> The campaign is pretty good
[0:01:51] <+yhom_tork> oh no is this the one with kevin spacey monkaS
[0:01:51] <derap41> BO1 is good
[0:01:52] <%Irridium> Spacey is Advanced Warfare, this one has the Game of Thrones guy
[0:01:52] <Ghostbody> @doomerskeletor13 nope, Kit Harrington
[0:01:53] <%RioGascar> If I remember infinite warefare it had a fun campaign
[0:01:53] <ralphfromdk> TheotherKristian Naw, that was advanced warfare... This one is John Snow
[0:02:00] <%doomerskeletor13> Which one had Spacey
[0:02:01] <Halospaz117> @yeeter_baelish no
[0:02:02] <manwithaxe> i came for CODapple pie, and you gave me Halo ice cream cake
[0:02:04] <joshua_42> This should be like two or three streams
[0:02:05] <+chiazam> The campaign is alright
[0:02:05] <andre11dr> No RE6 would've been bad RE or not, it's boring
[0:02:06] <+Rekinsinn> PogChamp
[0:02:10] <%Solidnick18> oh boy
[0:02:14] <tired_fan> Infinite Warfare's Campaign is Eh
[0:02:14] <puse9> is this when cod tried to be titanfall?

[0:02:17] <xxmagonx> @doomerskeletor13 AW cod
[0:02:17] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:02:17] <+michingmallecho> Wait...call of duty has a single player? I thought that was dlc
[0:02:18] <%psydaku> why not advanced warfare then?
[0:02:19] <Louie_Salmon> This is an interesting game to pick from the whole series
[0:02:23] <Reveresao> Woolie gonna be a gundam!!
[0:02:24] <%Terrarp> But Jon Snow from the beloved Game of Thrones show tho
[0:02:25] <Halospaz117> Ok, do we need a sign saying NOT THE ONE WITH SPACEY on the wall?
[0:02:26] <ralphfromdk> This is one of the shitty cods where they still kinda tried to copy titanfall but did it badly. Do not expect it to be good
[0:02:27] <+xjavx2014> mp is bad tooo
[0:02:30] <%krispen_wa> but where are the cod lorebeards
[0:02:31] <abusywizard> I for one, am very excited since i've never seen this one
[0:02:33] <+yhom_tork> but which gundam?
[0:02:35] <%Solidnick18> how long is it?
[0:02:36] <+JustToWatch> again, this isn't the one with kevin spacey
[0:02:43] <dmysta3000> CoD games have pretty decent story modes from what I hear
[0:02:44] <%donkeytron2000> Kit Chaddington
[0:02:47] <+Draco_Renegade> yep
[0:02:47] <%JustYudha> Yea
[0:02:50] <+duskrush> yeah
[0:02:50] <derap41> And people hated it
[0:02:51] <%Solidnick18> yes
[0:02:53] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Mars THIRSTS for the strength of its people!
[0:02:53] <Darren716> That was also AW
[0:02:54] <zamzoph> @Halospaz117 but this is the one in space-y Kappa
[0:02:54] <%JustYudha> It has more robots
[0:02:55] <Hawkbone_> Yes, it does
[0:02:57] <Jashter18> @yeeter_baelish UC Gundam definitely
[0:02:57] <%Irridium> it has a double jump and a dash
[0:02:58] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Hail Mars!
[0:02:58] <@Solidus_113> SPACE
[0:03:01] <+xjavx2014> yes
[0:03:01] <%cache_22> Advanced Warfare has near-future tech.
[0:03:02] <+michingmallecho> So are we going to able to go 3x as fast as the normal COD while painted red?
[0:03:02] <+duskrush> it has pressing F to pay respects
[0:03:02] <%doomerskeletor13> SPAAAAACE
[0:03:03] <Hawkbone_> It doesn't have wall run
[0:03:03] <+TheotherKristian> @ralphfromdk John Snow Halo
[0:03:04] <+Draco_Renegade> it has frappling hook and double jump
[0:03:05] <PrideOfFiddles> Advanced Warfare is future Korea
[0:03:06] <+jiggy_snipe> Woolie wants SPACE
[0:03:06] <+yhom_tork> F
[0:03:06] <+SainEdge> i remember when i was a dumb 15 year old and disliked all cod games and gave them a 0 on metacritic. Without playing them of course LUL
[0:03:07] <BlackermanZX> SPAAAAYCE
[0:03:07] <derap41> And Spacey
[0:03:08] <ditalos> bro he really playign COD
[0:03:08] <Darren716> F
[0:03:08] <%Josef_Stryker> F
[0:03:09] <TheEvilOmega> My order for best CoD campaigns go something like... CoD4, Blops 1, MW2, WaW, MW, uh...
[0:03:09] <+Rekinsinn> LUL
[0:03:13] <%Solidnick18> F
[0:03:14] <%Lion_kun> And Kevin Spacey.
[0:03:14] <+krabsan> F
[0:03:14] <gamewarden92> We will create memes today.
[0:03:15] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Yes
[0:03:18] <%Solidnick18> i like memes
[0:03:19] <+michingmallecho> F
[0:03:19] <$BallerSwagBro9k> but less
[0:03:20] <ditalos> @WoolieVersus is this you training to get back at Titanfall 2 PC players?
[0:03:22] <+chiazam> Advanced Warfare has some sope stuff too I guess
[0:03:23] <%ringabal> CODBLOPS IIIIIIIIN SPAAAAAAAACE
[0:03:23] <%doomerskeletor13> Does this game make you remember your history
[0:03:25] <%AlteisenReiseZ> RAMIREZ, DEFEND THE BURGER TOWN
[0:03:25] <PhantomMaskJr> Hey Punch Dad majinoElmo
[0:03:28] <Hawkbone_> Advanced Warfare doesn't have wall run but it does have better movement
[0:03:28] <ditalos> is this what the Woolie FPS saga is for?
[0:03:28] <jorniev> ADVANCED has SPACEY
[0:03:32] <%notgarza> And has REDACTED SPACEY
[0:03:32] <Darren716> Who made IW anyways?
[0:03:35] <andre11dr> I love how Woolie reasoning for this is "IT HAS SPACE THO" LUL
[0:03:36] <ralphfromdk> "shit, we are out of ideas, let's just make a shitty titanfall copy"
[0:03:36] <%Lion_kun> You traded Kevin Spacey for Kit Harrington.
[0:03:37] <%NeedlesD> NeedlesD subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 5 month streak!
[0:03:37] <+yhom_tork> ok Im into this lets do it
[0:03:37] <amiavamp> simulator shooter
[0:03:40] <%Solidnick18> will he do the duty of call
[0:03:40] <$BallerSwagBro9k> JON SNOW IS IN THIS
[0:03:44] <OldManDeckardCain> RAMIREZ, SHOOT DEATH STAR!
[0:03:45] <puse9> is this spacey warfrare?
[0:03:49] <%doomerskeletor13> @notgarza That’s AW, I made the same mistake
[0:03:51] <derap41> LUL CoD simulator LUL
[0:03:51] <@Menitta> Of all the COD games WOOLIE should play, its this one 100%
[0:03:51] <jorniev> KILL JON SNOW!
[0:03:53] <TheGamingCentaur> I consider IW to be one of the better stories so I'm excited to see what happens
[0:03:53] <Admiral_PopnFresh> "Simulator" woolie...play Arma
[0:03:55] <frostyjay3> Advance Warfare did most of the future stuff first, but Infinite cranked it up to 11
[0:04:00] <+Mrbaconator> the poo babbys went WAAAH this isn't modern day
[0:04:03] <@Menitta> AW is 2nd in line
[0:04:07] <derap41> IW tried to eat titanfall
[0:04:07] <ralphfromdk> puse9 Naw. It's John Snow
[0:04:08] <au_d3n> So was the main reason everyone hated WWII because the loot boxes?
[0:04:09] <ivanmistwalker> DOUBLE DIP
[0:04:11] <ditalos> woolie is playing all those FPS games just to payback TF2 and Apex players
[0:04:12] <%doomerskeletor13> Title of the stream should be “this is NOT the one with Spacey”
[0:04:15] <+Bailey__gaming> @WoolieVersus hey Woolie i really liked your GG video! good job
[0:04:21] <dmysta3000> I prefer dumb sci-fi CoD to Military wank CoD
[0:04:29] <@Menitta> Yo nice
[0:04:31] <%ringabal> SICK
[0:04:32] <%PirateDad_> is this the campaign?
[0:04:33] <Zayasu> the worst yakuza
[0:04:34] <+yhom_tork> PogChamp
[0:04:35] <%Josef_Stryker> SICK
[0:04:36] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Hot take, I liked the wall run/boost in COD
[0:04:37] <%Solidnick18> this isn't just any war.... THIS A SPACE WAR
[0:04:38] <%0rond> TRUE
[0:04:38] <jorniev> KIWAMI MEANS EXTREME
[0:04:39] <TheEvilOmega> 0 is the best of the Yakuza games.
[0:04:39] <@Menitta> 0 is 100% better
[0:04:40] <Ecliptic_Origins> oh yeah
[0:04:40] <%Josef_Stryker> Absolutely
[0:04:41] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Tru
[0:04:41] <+talkingrain3139> TRUE
[0:04:42] <DianaTheAscian> nice
[0:04:42] <WarKamex> correct
[0:04:42] <andre11dr> Yes ,totally agree
[0:04:43] <Admiral_PopnFresh> well yeah
[0:04:44] <puse9> Dame dane!
[0:04:46] <Halospaz117> I mean, yeah
[0:04:46] <+michingmallecho> Nice
[0:04:46] <Lynxystem> Zero is WAY better
[0:04:47] <+SainEdge> yeah
[0:04:47] <xxmagonx> This game has best robot boi.
[0:04:48] <AppleBerryKitty> Woolie give me your shirt
[0:04:49] <derap41> So Brave taking that stance
[0:04:49] <ivanmistwalker> VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea
[0:04:49] <%donkeytron2000> CoD is military wank to be fair
[0:04:49] <+chiazam> 3 IS THE WORST ONE
[0:04:49] <%doomerskeletor13> EXTREME
[0:04:50] <@Menitta> Its the best way to play Yakuza 1
[0:04:50] <%Prevot> well yeah no shit
[0:04:52] <DianaTheAscian> correct
[0:04:52] <andre11dr> 2 is better
[0:04:53] <%Lightwolfe> cowadoody???
[0:04:53] <%Irridium> I don't know I played 3
[0:04:54] <%Solidnick18> yakuza 5 is my favorite
[0:04:55] <%0rond> KIWAMI MEANS EXTREME KIWAMI MOVES SUCK
[0:04:57] <Dante_Namikaze1> yeah it's because they broke the pacing with all the extra stuff that they put in
[0:04:57] <+michingmallecho> Well it was the first one
[0:04:58] <%Lion_kun> 3 is the worst one.
[0:04:58] <Halospaz117> It pretty much is an Expansion
[0:04:58] <+chiazam> WHAT ABOUT THE STORY!?
[0:04:59] <@Solidus_113> Isn't Nishikiyama just a good character? Kappa
[0:04:59] <OldManDeckardCain> KIWAMI 2 IS BEST
[0:05:00] <%guyalex> zero is absolutely better, kiwami 2 is better as well, but zero is easily the best of the three
[0:05:02] <%ringabal> Hey, if it aint broke
[0:05:02] <ashenchevalierthesecond> My hot take is that I enjoyed Kiwami 1 way more than Kiwami 2
[0:05:03] <Zayasu> and the bossfights suck ass LUL
[0:05:04] <astrophizz> yeah. Kiwami 2 is better
[0:05:06] <thetruenicster> Kiwami 2 best one
[0:05:09] <+Superbro64> "GET THAT MO THER FU CKER"
[0:05:14] <+Dr_DangerPhD> Kiwami 1 is basically lightyears better than the ps2 version and worth it for that alone
[0:05:18] <@Solidus_113> Kiwami 1 isn't great because Yakuza 1 isn't great
[0:05:20] <%Terrarp> Kiwami is super short
[0:05:27] <%doomerskeletor13> There’s less content cause it’s a remake yeah
[0:05:29] <%IronBagel1> The franchises traded dipping sauces
[0:05:31] <%ringabal> "Yep, that's me."
[0:05:33] <+aishman> aishman subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months! Hey W&V, Woolie I love the new GG Lore video! Also love the new original song V! Though my favorite one of yours is still Battlecry cause I screamed it when AEW came around. Hope ya'll are having a wonderful day.
[0:05:34] <OldManDeckardCain> yakuza 1 is street fighter 1 basically
[0:05:35] <Halospaz117> I like the story for 1...
[0:05:35] <jorniev> FIGHT THE TIGERS!
[0:05:36] <%Solidnick18> yeah
[0:05:41] <Serge_12> I hope Woolie play Advanced Warfare!
[0:05:42] <BlueDragonBot> Kiwami is my favorite one lol
[0:05:43] <%Terrarp> It was a PS2 game so yeah
[0:05:46] <%guyalex> solidus has the right of it, yakuza 1 just wasnt great
[0:05:52] <%Lion_kun> Kiwami 2 is waaaay better
[0:05:55] <@Solidus_113> Kiwami 2 came out after Yakuza 6
[0:05:56] <andre11dr> Yakuza 1 was good when it was the first Yakuza, but didn't age that good
[0:05:57] <+SainEdge> sure is LUL
[0:05:57] <%0rond> 2 is insane
[0:05:57] <Halospaz117> DRAGON ENGINE BABY
[0:05:57] <+inkthepeasant> Yakuza 2 has my fav story I think
[0:05:58] <%doomerskeletor13> Yakuza Kiwami 2 slaps
[0:05:59] <Zayasu> 2 uses the dragon engine
[0:06:00] <pzambarda> fps boiiiiiis
[0:06:00] <manwithaxe> yeah kiawami 2 has the 6 engine
[0:06:02] <ralphfromdk> Thanks for the KPOPTT @aishman
[0:06:05] <Darren716> Kiwami 2 is fucking rad
[0:06:05] <%Solidnick18> 2 is the dragon engine
[0:06:08] <%Prevot> BOSS Coffee
[0:06:10] <%Irridium> 2 uses the new Dragon Engine. Shit's HOT
[0:06:13] <redrins> thats what 6 did pretty much
[0:06:14] <TheEvilOmega> The main issue I had with 6 is that fights suck unless you grab a weapon.
[0:06:15] <%0rond> kiwami 2 is so crazy
[0:06:16] <%Solidnick18> yep
[0:06:16] <Dante_Namikaze1> 2 is a lot of people's favorite
[0:06:16] <$BallerSwagBro9k> MUNEY
[0:06:18] <+Proxzo> COD?!
[0:06:20] <ashenchevalierthesecond> I couldn't get into the story for Kiwami 2 because it felt like I was never actually given a reason to care about what was happening compared to 0 or Kiwami 1
[0:06:24] <%doomerskeletor13> Hell yeah all that product placement
[0:06:25] <%Terrarp> Kiwami 2 and Yakuza 6 use the Dragon Engine
[0:06:30] <+jiggy_snipe> nope just an engine remake
[0:06:32] <+michingmallecho> Yakuza 1 brought the opportunity to continue yakuza until today so I always give it dap even when I know it kinda sucks LUL
[0:06:36] <%ringabal> When your franchise revolves around a single environment, that place better be POSH.
[0:06:39] <@Solidus_113> yes
[0:06:41] <%Terrarp> No loading times and microwave heat moves
[0:06:43] <+jiggy_snipe> Kiwami used 0 and Kiwami 2 used 6 Ithink
[0:06:46] <%Irridium> the one Judgement uses

[0:06:54] <OldManDeckardCain> it's really nice of v to prep for future lp with woolie Kappa
[0:06:54] <@Menitta> Kiwami 2 is on 6's Engine.
[0:06:58] <Darren716> Is IW connected to any of the other CoDs at all?
[0:06:59] <redrins> kiwami 2 and 6 are the ones running on the same engine
[0:07:00] <%Solidnick18> mountin dew
[0:07:03] <DianaTheAscian> oh kawami one is only 4 years old
[0:07:04] <@Menitta> And Judgment
[0:07:05] <%doomerskeletor13> Kiwami added some cutscenes but Kiwami 2 is basically the same exact story as the og
[0:07:06] <%Lion_kun> 0 and 1 are old engine
[0:07:08] <andre11dr> I've actually recently beaten Judgement as well, and i gotta say, it's definitely in my top 4 of the Y games
[0:07:11] <%Solidnick18> judgment Kreygasm
[0:07:11] <+michingmallecho> Judgement, kiwami 2, yakuza 6, and yakuza 7 use dragon engine so far
[0:07:13] <DianaTheAscian> i thought it was older
[0:07:15] <Dante_Namikaze1> 2 is the During Engine, 0 and Kiwanis is the old engine
[0:07:19] <+xdeathknightx> Woolie's face filled with regret
[0:07:21] <@Solidus_113> Yakuza Zero and Kiwami 1 still use the same engine as Yakuza 3, it's not until Y6 and Kiwami 2 where the engine changes
[0:07:22] <@Menitta> 5, 0, and Kiwami 1 are all the same engine
[0:07:28] <+Kyma1020> Kiwami 2, 6, and Judgement are on the Dragon Engine
[0:07:30] <derap41> Is it cold brewed or iced?
[0:07:31] <$kirin_fellwinter> Cheer500 Let's go!!! I'm loving this new Woolie Cross V era were in. keep on rocking guys and thanks for filling all our dark souls with light.

[0:07:34] <+chiazam> I enjoyed the story in Yakuza 1
[0:07:40] <TinSilver> Blackout GOD
[0:07:40] <+SainEdge> Kiwami has some of the old problems and some new ideas that dont click. So in some ways they didnt go far enough and in other ways they added some bad stuff LUL
[0:07:41] <TheEvilOmega> As an aside, I've been playing through the Devil May Cry games. I'm on 4, Dante's campaign. Was fighting the knights and they fired their big attack as I was shooting my shotgun and I think it reflect it back into them?
[0:07:57] <@Menitta> Also Yakuza 1 has the weakest substories compared to the rest
[0:08:04] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Fire God Old Man at Onsen

[0:08:14] <$BallerSwagBro9k> JON SNOW
[0:08:16] <%Solidnick18> no jonhs
[0:08:17] <%Prevot> Yakuza 0 and 6 have by far the best substories
[0:08:19] <+jessedouglas> Yakuza 0 has some of the best substories!
[0:08:21] <derap41> Jonny boy
[0:08:22] <OldManDeckardCain> yakuza 1 substories is just "someone tries to con kiryu" LUL
[0:08:24] <+jiggy_snipe> Jon Snow or John Codman
[0:08:25] <@Menitta> But for sure, Yakuza Kiwami is how to play Yakuza 1. Don't play the PS2 game
[0:08:26] <andre11dr> Judgment had some great sidequests

[0:23:47] <Hawkbone_> SPACE IS THE RADDEST
[0:23:50] <ShortAssRibs> We're made out of space shit
[0:23:50] <KapitanOrient> fuck my homies, all my homies hate my homies
[0:23:51] <+ManOfReason> All my homies love space
[0:23:54] <$kirin_fellwinter> Woolie and V are about to cause a purchase and player boom for this game lol
[0:23:57] <gamewarden92> Love space, All my homies love space
[0:23:57] <JaseAdrift> space is alright
[0:24:00] <%Solidnick18> i still need to play 3
[0:24:02] <Lancaster_H> @Hawkbone_ sure but IW sucks man
[0:24:05] <%doomerskeletor13> Oh man 3 is rough
[0:24:10] <%Captain_matt> Captain_matt subscribed at Tier 1.
[0:24:14] <+chiazam> Kiwami 3 IS COMING
[0:24:14] <%ultimatetotoro> oh shit
[0:24:19] <Hawkbone_> @Lancaster_H Multiplayer sure, but the campaign is actually really good.
[0:24:29] <andre11dr> 3 is probably the worst one
[0:24:30] <TheEvilOmega> Man, Yakuza 6 has, like, two and a half hours of cutscenes before you get to play.
[0:24:33] <%ultimatetotoro> I thought this was modern warfare, not infinite warfare
[0:24:36] <+michingmallecho> Is kiwami 3 confirmed ?
[0:24:39] <andre11dr> At least for me
[0:24:45] <a_reused_meme> funny thing is i got both IW and titanfall 2 yet i enjoy both
[0:24:46] <ggbhtg> Moobot doubts Captain Toad's power....LUL
[0:24:47] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Miles Morales LP Kappa
[0:24:55] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Miles Morales is shorter so play that 1st
[0:25:03] <+michingmallecho> yakuza 5 has a lot of cutscenes in the beginning...they all kinda do
[0:25:03] <%Prevot> I always juggle multiple games and end up not finishing any of them
[0:25:03] <%flarebears> Oh Boy, Is the COD:BLOPS next??
[0:25:13] <%TheGunrunner91> TheGunrunner91 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 4 month streak! Oh boy I cant wait to see this
[0:25:14] <%ringabal> Miles Morales is the closest we'll get to a Static Shock game.
[0:25:20] <@Menitta> nah juggle everything and have all the games fall on your face
[0:25:32] <GoodShotCam> same @prevot 😭😭

[0:30:02] <+jiggy_snipe> I can understand people not wanting their franchise to become another franchise
[0:30:05] <Lancaster_H> @Solidus_113 CoD4 Promod is still going strong on PC actually
[0:30:06] <GoodShotCam> zombies isn't even that bad

[0:30:50] <%Solidnick18> dahh
[0:30:52] <%0rond> don't listen to him! it's all connected!
[0:30:53] <%ringabal> Mass Effect would hold an LP slot for 2 years.
[0:30:54] <VidulaSaix> Ill be honest I was kinda expecting Yakuza today LUL
[0:30:56] <NiktenKing> Ah yes... the scifi game that is ROCKSMITH
[0:30:56] <ditalos> The pattern is: Woolie is training his inner FPS beast to destroy Apex and TF2 players
[0:30:59] <ggbhtg> Maybe sci-fi is just the current mood, chat
[0:31:04] <andre11dr> Unless the game sucks.....Star For 2.....

[0:31:43] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @Menitta YOU ARE A MAN OF CULTURE
[0:31:44] <+jiggy_snipe> KH2 has some of the best combat in an ARPG
[0:31:46] <brunoberserk> is the parking lot
[0:31:47] <%Solidnick18> it's about sadness
[0:31:49] <TheEvilOmega> 3 is literally about finishing Disney movies and then having a plot dump in the last two hours of the game.
[0:31:50] <+xdeathknightx> Did Woolie see the Darkest Dungeon 2 trailer?
[0:31:52] <LeeOhX> Anyone who knows anything about kingdom hearts is about a man scorned by a company and he trys to create the game he always wanted to
[0:31:53] <Explodincatz> its about when you walk away you dont hear me say
[0:31:53] <%Solidnick18> and parking lots
[0:31:55] <+Acecorleone> KH2 fun gameplay weird AF story

[0:32:49] <NiktenKing> those movies hold up so well
[0:32:49] <Hawkbone_> This game has a surprisingly good soundtrack in general
[0:32:58] <derap41> I still Prefer Alien and Terminator over the sequels fight me!
[0:32:58] <+TheotherKristian> Alien is great wtf
[0:33:00] <amiavamp> 1980 will always be 20 years away
[0:33:03] <%GoogleyGareth> I thought it was the 90s what the fuck
[0:33:04] <%TheGunrunner91> When people say "20 years ago" I still think of the 80s
[0:33:06] <%Laufzwerg> this guy living in 2030
[0:33:06] <+offbeatninja123> uhhh...
[0:33:07] <andre11dr> Now time for the 3rd one Kappa

[0:33:21] <Ner234> Cursed Knowledge
[0:33:22] <%Irridium> @TheGunrunner91 the 80's are now 40 years ago
[0:33:29] <PredatorKev> Fun fact V, a high school put on alien as a play
[0:33:31] <derap41> Revelations isn't terrible
[0:33:34] <%TheGunrunner91> nyannAngry
[0:33:35] <Ipsenscastle> I got stuck in time somewhere around 2000
[0:33:36] <%Irridium> that hurt to type
[0:33:38] <amiavamp> Retrowave has been popular for longer than the actual 80s
[0:33:41] <%jinking79> best Horror movie Alien best action movie Aliens
[0:33:41] <%TheGunrunner91> Good
[0:33:44] <BlueDragonBot> The first Alien is one my favorite movie of all time
[0:33:45] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Just pretend 3 and 4 never happened
[0:33:51] <FreedomARX7> Both amazing
[0:33:56] <andre11dr> Man this reminds, there's more bad Aliens movies than good ones
[0:34:06] <aluddss> xcom
[0:34:08] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @andre11dr dont let it set in
[0:34:10] <%IronBagel1> I liked Alien but never watched Aliens. I should probably do that.
[0:34:11] <derap41> Alien Ripped of something else anyway
[0:34:12] <Hawkbone_> DOOM was originally a licensed Alien game
[0:34:15] <TheEvilOmega> Did you all know that there are SEVEN (7!!!) Tremors movies?
[0:34:19] <zamzoph> Aliens copied Starcraft wtf?!
[0:34:20] <Marc_The_Frog > oh word, Kevin Spacey time
[0:34:28] <Halospaz117> Not the Kevin Spacey one
[0:34:31] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @Marc_The_Frog Nope Jon Snow time
[0:34:32] <+jiggy_snipe> Jon Snow time
[0:34:33] <Hawkbone_> @Marc_The_Frog Nope, thats Advanced Warfare
[0:34:34] <GoodShotCam> yeah but there's like 10 Leprechauns
[0:34:36] <leroypi> First gun to have the ammo counter on it
[0:34:37] <Daxalog> Terminator , Aliens and Lord of The Rings. The 3 movies games take inspiration from.
[0:34:38] <TheGamingCentaur> I love Sgt. Johnson, but I can't deny the fact that he's taken from Aliens
[0:34:41] <Halospaz117> Again, I think we need a sign saying it's not the Kevin Spacey one
[0:34:44] <Marc_The_Frog > oh thank christ
[0:34:55] <%0rond> you will never have a strong waifu to mamoru you
[0:34:57] <Ipsenscastle> Alien is so much better than Aliens
[0:34:57] <amiavamp> And Full Metal Jacket
[0:35:00] <AllenDeadman> I love that line
[0:35:00] <Safarihat> im diving deep into pompeii graffiti
[0:35:02] <%andyfutrell> I love kingdom hearts but I feel like wooile will just insult the story and by the end not caring about the story and saying the story makes no sense which I am tired of hearing
[0:35:03] <GoodShotCam> ITS NOT THE KEVIN SPACEY ONE there
[0:35:10] <%ultimatetotoro> ripley protect, ripley attac, Ripley's gotcha your goddamn back
[0:35:14] <+KgKid51> aliens 3 NotLikeThis
[0:35:14] <derap41> @Ipsenscastle Braver words have never been spoken

[1:05:03] <jorniev> ARE MARTIANS THE RUSSIAN?
[1:05:03] <derap41> @raven_frame Given the response to the trailer not really
[1:05:08] <@Menitta> AW was far for near future and BO3 was even farther than that but this isnt super far for far future
[1:05:11] <herzogtheanimal> we need that anus back under control

[1:06:50] <$raven_frame> Is this what Call of Duty does to people?
[1:06:52] <derap41> +1 warcrimes
[1:06:52] <+Slybluedemon> The new Modern Warfare had a cool campaign
[1:06:53] <%Theycallmenerf> Have we done the F to Pay respects?

[1:06:57] <GoodShotCam> indeed it is his first CoD
[1:06:58] <@Menitta> He tested 3 bur effectively yes

[1:07:05] <NotHereToStream> canted sights
[1:07:07] <%ringabal> Style: Hood
[1:07:09] <+yhom_tork> are we the titans? PogChamp
[1:07:19] <wrydiculous> woolie should try other weapons
[1:07:21] <jorniev> VOLK is the space ak it seems
[1:07:25] <@Solidus_113> war crimes must become 2nd nature
[1:07:31] <derap41> Now you're getting it Woolie
[1:07:32] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @derap41 I doubt this franchise does any good in China anyway, they usually limit game violence to cartoonish
[1:07:35] <%Theycallmenerf> Chat, are we the baddies?
[1:07:37] <jaygee303> 4 was a better start
[1:07:39] <Hawkbone_> Volk is an AK but with lasers
[1:07:45] <@Menitta> It still is very close to Titanfall too
[1:07:47] <%doomerskeletor13> @theycallmenerf Yes
[1:07:49] <NotHereToStream> black ops 1 would of been good start too
[1:07:55] <@Menitta> like the "feel" of the game
[1:07:56] <+doctordunno> We might *kind* of be the titans
[1:07:57] <derap41> @Admiral_PopnFresh Didn't stop them from going back to using Russia as the main baddy
[1:07:59] <$raven_frame> They were killing civilians earlier.
[1:08:00] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[1:08:06] <zamzoph> grenade the grenade
[1:08:06] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[1:08:10] <+MaddyCaddy> How does this weapon load 2 separate mags without jamming?
[1:08:10] <derap41> Its an AK
[1:08:10] <%ringabal> MASTERFUL TACTICS
[1:08:11] <$raven_frame> It just means we're both baddies.
[1:08:11] <%SilverDevilfish> I will stop the grenade with my own grenade - Woolie Madden
[1:08:13] <+Slybluedemon> Lazer AK
[1:08:14] <%cobalt_phoenix_> is that a laser ak
[1:08:18] <NotHereToStream> not ballistic DansGame
[1:08:19] <jorniev> SPACE AK
[1:08:22] <dreadedcthulhu> ak-4500
[1:08:23] <jamsbybetty> wait the laser gun in Titanfall is just called the VOLT
[1:08:24] <%PirateDad_> Space AK
[1:08:26] <wrydiculous> A for real pew pew AK
[1:08:28] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @Hawkbone_ THE PEOPLE'S PEW PEW Kkomrade
[1:08:32] <derap41> SP-AK
[1:08:33] <jamsbybetty> aaaaaaugh they ripped it all off!
[1:08:37] <+doctordunno> There's probably something to be said about the space-AK being the bad guy gun in infinite warfare, but the good guy gun in titanfall
[1:08:39] <GoodShotCam> BO3 would be closer to how it is today but you could do worse than BO1
[1:08:44] <amiavamp> does wallbanging not exist in this one?
[1:08:53] <+chiazam> F
[1:08:56] <@Menitta> BO3 controls identically to IW
[1:08:56] <+yhom_tork> F
[1:08:57] <Pillagius> cohh7
[1:08:59] <+lazysaiyajin> F
[1:08:59] <Hawkbone_> It does, but only for ballistic weapons

[1:09:01] <%Solidnick18> 1
[1:09:06] <Darren716> Do they use fake quotes for this one?
[1:09:08] <%Josef_Stryker> These death quotes are *all* about how evil the SDF is
[1:09:09] <gamewarden92> They call them "Earthen"
[1:09:13] <%Reverend_Roscoe> ADS AND ABS

[1:09:52] <%Solidnick18> hahahah
[1:09:53] <+kewlmyc> Surprised they're starting with Infinite Warfare, and not COD4.
[1:09:59] <Admiral_PopnFresh> People should just say Terran, it rolls so much better off the tongue than Earthan
[1:10:01] <Darren716> Woolie learning the first rule of CoD campaigns, the enemies guns are usually shite
[1:10:03] <whirly25> the A in AK stands for astro
[1:10:03] <%dekkitout> At this point, don't bother unless it's inbetween your feet
[1:10:04] <dadeaner> @kewlmyc I was thinking the same
[1:10:08] <amiavamp> oof
[1:10:08] <@Solidus_113> red indicator bad
[1:10:08] <%JustYudha> Don't chase after grenades, Woolie
[1:10:10] <coreyyotto> Don't be a cool guy

[1:12:31] <+StooEsq> Call of Duty is also a mobile game, too
[1:12:36] <@Menitta> I honestly bet Woolie would dig the Crysis games
[1:12:37] <+Aldesso> WHaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!!!!!!
[1:12:38] <%Solidnick18> lol jk
[1:12:53] <$raven_frame> This part feels like it noticably escalated in difficulty.
[1:12:57] <+Aldesso> this is not real life. woolies playin a cod game. i love it
[1:12:57] <TheEvilOmega> A few weeks ago I did a run of MW2's campaign on veteran. Fun stuff. Except the Favela levels. Those suuuuucked.
[1:12:58] <%gatorafan> sadly, space death it's still just death
[1:13:14] <%doomerskeletor13> Space death is still cool tho

[1:13:55] <GeneralHysterics> if you own a yacht, there's a real good chance you're an ass hole
[1:13:57] <%Irridium> not the SS Epstein!

[1:14:03] <Hawkbone_> There is
[1:14:10] <%doomerskeletor13> Oh no not St James!

[1:14:22] <%gatorafan> MY SPACE YATCH daedra1CryingTibs
[1:14:40] <OldManDeckardCain> oh no, not SPACE LOLITA Kappa
[1:14:41] <skeletonknifefight> black ops 3 has a sky yacht
[1:14:47] <+AWKWARDL0SER> Yoooo! This is the third best CoD campaign aside from 4 & BO2 great pick the set peace’s are crazy
[1:14:47] <Hawkbone_> Crawling up stairs like a worm
[1:15:02] <%Solidnick18> remember to nade windows
[1:15:04] <$raven_frame> What is this time frame where the Martians were able to develop a military industry that can challenge Earth, but we're still using Vectors and AKs?
[1:15:23] <skeletonknifefight> AKs will still be functional after the heat death of the universe
[1:15:23] <NotHereToStream> vectors do look kinda futuristic
[1:15:23] <Daxalog> If it aint broke
[1:15:31] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @raven_frame so is thta the plot then? martian colony decides to revolt?
[1:15:32] <%ringabal> "Flank them!" Woolie engages a Mexican Standoff
[1:15:32] <Hawkbone_> @raven_frame They aren't vectors and AKs, they just look like them
[1:15:33] <%Solidnick18> slowly
[1:15:35] <$serpenttucker> @raven_frame the time frame where ballistic weapons are still just as good. Don't fix what ain't broken
[1:15:37] <amiavamp> It's like Halo where we're using assault rifles that can't hit the broad side of a barn but we can develop personal shields better than the Covenant's
[1:15:44] <%doomerskeletor13> Remember, don’t shoot until you can see the whites of their Space Eyes
[1:15:44] <PrideOfFiddles> I don't think i've ever seen someone crawling thier way through Cod. This is gonna be a great LP
[1:15:54] <wrydiculous> dual mag vectors and AKs that go pew pew instead of bang bang
[1:15:57] <gomennasorry> kill mean dead
[1:15:57] <coreybom> @raven_frame Hey, AKs been around since the 50’s. If it works it works.
[1:15:58] <Hawkbone_> @SaltkeyAndAckfish American Revolution but if the nazis hijacked the colonies
[1:15:59] <ironwall_havoc> can't go wrong with ballistic
[1:16:01] <Oxybe> You might be able to outsmart Woolie... maybe. Maybe. But no Martian can outsmart bullet.
[1:16:10] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @Hawkbone_ gotcha
[1:16:18] <%Solidnick18> light em up
[1:16:19] <+Stormzcales_Lair> musik
[1:16:26] <%Irridium> how badly you killed the enemy or civilians
[1:16:27] <$raven_frame> AKs are just a meme now.
[1:16:31] <Darren716> Is the ttk higher in this game?
[1:16:39] <andre11dr> Hopefully they all go to space heaven, for their space gods
[1:16:43] <Darren716> Seems like enemies arent dying as quickly compared to old cods
[1:16:50] <Explodincatz> i like the bullet proof kiosk's
[1:16:53] <jorniev> i still remember how in EXPANSE earth is so fucked cause of overpopulation, and basically filled with poor people, and a martian just wathing like, we are fighing you guys and you live like this!?

[1:18:22] <Darren716> Well we learned that in Blops2
[1:18:24] <derap41> We're just depicting 9/11
[1:18:25] <%Irridium> they did it they saved the city!
[1:18:25] <Oxybe> I love Spacelumbus!
[1:18:26] <tanarath> Discovered so much, just like Columbus!
[1:18:29] <Darren716> In the far off future world of 2025

[1:18:38] <+chiazam> OH YEAH
[1:18:40] <Admiral_PopnFresh> this is like 9/11 meats Operation Stardust
[1:18:40] <%JustYudha> Lol yes just yell at people who are shell shocked
[1:18:43] <%gatorafan> So... this ends on space racism doesn't it? daedra1DerpyTibs
[1:18:45] <wrydiculous> man i hope woolie picks up the type-2 assault rifle
[1:18:46] <Oxybe> Spacelumbus discovered Spacemerica!

[1:20:34] <NotHereToStream> slow fire rate lmg? get that out of here
[1:20:41] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @WoolieVersus snap your sights!
[1:20:42] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> wait why does it have recoil
[1:20:51] <jaygee303> The ffps bumblefucks here might be better than halo
[1:20:52] <BryansFury> that's a really star wars noise
[1:20:53] <No3rdImpactPlz> Is this the one with the Spacey Kevins?
[1:20:54] <GoodShotCam> shimmy shimmy wall shimmy game shimmy yay
[1:21:01] <TheEvilOmega> The RPD was a pretty slow rate of fire, but it was the best LMG in CoD4.
[1:21:01] <%unclekulikov> Big Earth 2150 vibes
[1:21:03] <Oxybe> Humans requires Time and Training, which is more money overtime. Robots are a onetime cost where you install software and let them rip... and IF they survive, you may maintain them or use as spare parts
[1:21:07] <tanarath> I can't wait for Space Canada to call Woolie a sociopath & strip him of his rank, just like Columbus.
[1:21:08] <Darren716> Woolie needs to play MW2, Foley will make sure he knows about aiming down the sights
[1:21:13] <%SirGO0SE> Woolie's not bad with them nades
[1:21:27] <%Lightwolfe> How are Woolie's fruit killing skills?
[1:21:32] <%koolaid_kevster> thats ETHAN
[1:21:33] <+funnyfunnykid> Funny, this is the one call of duty game I gave a literal shit about.
[1:21:34] <%BREAKS4EVER> was good Omega??
[1:21:42] <%Josef_Stryker> One cool thing in this game is that the robot enemies may not die in one hit and you can find them crawling after you.
[1:21:52] <@Solidus_113> melon
[1:21:54] <$serpenttucker> I fucking love the artstyle of this game. <3 aaron beck
[1:21:54] <Darren716> Oh shit water melons
[1:22:06] <TheEvilOmega> Okay, it's still the best LMG in CoD.
[1:22:10] <%Josef_Stryker> This game's campaign definitely was better than it had any right to be

[1:22:57] <NotHereToStream> bo2 charged sniper rifle was op
[1:23:17] <herzogtheanimal> CoD campaigns are generally pretty good they just have to have a dumb shooty shooty bang bang surface to appease the masses/US military
[1:23:29] <%dekkitout> Nukes in sci fi sound like a quick way to piss everyone off
[1:23:29] <TheEvilOmega> The RPD had a giant clip and basically no recoil with an amazing iron sight.
[1:23:38] <TheEvilOmega> How is any other LMG as good or even better?
[1:23:45] <Darren716> I liked the AK lmg in blops 1
[1:23:51] <herzogtheanimal> The Black Ops series generally points out how shitty your actions are and everyone loses in the end
[1:23:53] <NotHereToStream> RPD
[1:23:54] <DianaTheAscian> thinking about would robot soldiers even be humanoid?
[1:23:54] <%ringabal> Is that the script?
[1:23:55] <jorniev> nukes are way more dangerous in space
[1:24:09] <GoodShotCam> stoner63? on par at least
[1:24:13] <brachydios777> I don’t know who’s attacking but I blame Zeon
[1:24:17] <+funnyfunnykid> So how's the Kris Vector with 2 MAGS?
[1:24:27] <@Menitta> he said the thing
[1:24:31] <Darren716> I'd say the first 2 MW games are pretty critical, like i'd say both of those dont paint the US in a good light

[1:27:39] <derap41> CoD guns are very similar
[1:27:40] <%r0chelimit> weird that they didn't just reuse the watermelons fro MW

[1:30:33] <black_pariah> give woolie new tech and he'll gimmick it to death
[1:30:36] <$serpenttucker> @Spankminister the enviroment is target rich. They are just choosing specific targets
[1:30:41] <jorniev> tis is why i like titanfall more
[1:30:42] <TheEvilOmega> 3-1 actual, danger close. I repeat, danger close.
[1:30:45] <+TheOneCalledRock> Der Eisendrache is just *chief kiss*
[1:30:47] <Darren716> Does this game have a predator missle equivelent?
[1:30:49] <Johannen> What is this madness? Woolie playing a call of duty game?
[1:30:58] <@Menitta> man, now I wanna play Crysis 2
[1:30:58] <+TheOneCalledRock> i hope cold war's zombies can live up
[1:31:00] <Hawkbone_> Black Ops 3 had the best zombies mode by the end of its like
[1:31:01] <zamzoph> throw all the grenades
[1:31:12] <derap41> You know that Scene in generation kill where they drop a Bomb in a tiny village...Don't know why I'm reminded of that
[1:31:18] <herzogtheanimal> Man I really would want woolie to get into zombies it's just so hard to get into especially without much FPS experience
[1:31:19] <GoodShotCam> yessss 👌
[1:31:23] <iosephe> Guns guns guns
[1:31:25] <herzogtheanimal> It's tough for casuals to get into the lore

[1:31:43] <andre11dr> Haha gun go BRRRRRRR
[1:31:46] <Lancaster_H> woolie really needs to start sprinting
[1:31:55] <Darren716> And crouching
[1:31:56] <GoodShotCam> same I hope cold war zombies fills the hole that blops4 promised and failed to fill up
[1:32:00] <+Proxzo> many guys
[1:32:01] <derap41> eh CoD was the game that popularized infinite health
[1:32:04] <+Proxzo> east side
[1:32:19] <Hawkbone_> HOW
[1:32:22] <@Solidus_113> how
[1:32:23] <+lazysaiyajin> throw up
[1:32:29] <skeletonknifefight> there is actually a limited health mode in this game, the specialist difficulty. its really cool actually, has different effects based on where enemies shoot you
[1:32:33] <$BallerSwagBro9k> tank man
[1:32:51] <%EdenOfLove> what is that thing with 6/6 woolie keeps trying?
[1:32:52] <halfmasks> They have the high ground
[1:32:53] <aluddss> remember when cod had infinite spawning enemies as long as you didn't move up?
[1:32:56] <+lazysaiyajin> its infinite respawn
[1:32:57] <PrideOfFiddles> Will Woolie learn that you can cook grenades during this playthrough? place your bets
[1:32:57] <gamewarden92> I feel like Woolie and his gunship is the only one actually fighting in this battle.
[1:32:58] <+TheOneCalledRock> god i don't even REMEMBER blops 4's zombies LUL
[1:32:58] <Bigyanno> What happened to zombies? I remember when it was just a fun side thing with a couple of maps and some funky guns where some random people from each of the factions say one liners
[1:33:02] <redrins> we doing air support % run?
[1:33:05] <NotHereToStream> goddamn spawn closets
[1:33:08] <%ringabal> Woolie may be the only man to run Tank on a DPS FPS

[1:33:20] <derap41> @aluddss MW2 White House Flashbacks
[1:33:21] <gomennasorry> i wonder if this is a section where they infinitely spawn until you move up
[1:33:27] <herzogtheanimal> Black Ops 4's zombies had such a good story
[1:33:34] <herzogtheanimal> Game wasn't even bad
[1:33:43] <Hawkbone_> @Bigyanno Lovecraftian gods, time travel, and multiverses happened.
[1:33:44] <+chiazam> This is a much better angle
[1:33:48] <Bigyanno> The Zombies that I played in WaW didn't even have a story
[1:33:54] <skeletonknifefight> bo4 zombies was too split between chaos/aether. neither got the attention they deserved
[1:33:56] <herzogtheanimal> It did you just didn't notice
[1:34:01] <Darren716> you got hit
[1:34:02] <+TheOneCalledRock> OH
[1:34:06] <@Solidus_113> hacks get cancelled when you get hit
[1:34:07] <andre11dr> I probably played Zombies the most in Blops 2
[1:34:07] <amiavamp> When are they going to stop being cowards and call it Call of Duty 26?
[1:34:11] <GoodShotCam> aether story maybe. chaos story was weird and boring to me. gameplay was good tho can't lie.
[1:34:14] <derap41> Man Geneva is fucked
[1:34:27] <skeletonknifefight> chaos story was a little boring, but i really liked the maps and aesthetics of it
[1:34:28] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule

[1:34:41] <herzogtheanimal> Chaos could have taken off given the right resources
[1:34:41] <Hawkbone_> The tutorial for the hacking had you hack through walls and Woolie still hasn't figured out you can hack through walls.
[1:34:41] <+TheOneCalledRock> blops 4 had the dual stories right? one about the lovecraftian group and another with the old crew?
[1:34:45] <+Proxzo> These dang Mars People
[1:34:45] <herzogtheanimal> Shame how they decided to do it

[1:41:08] <%Shardlab> @Slybluedemon Because this is what Ace Combat is like
[1:41:08] <XeroSigmaPrime> Its muted, but still has noise since youre still in/just outside of the atmosphere
[1:41:09] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @Menitta yeah, i haven't seen this before. I remember it got a ton of hate because it's pretty not-cod

[1:41:39] <black_pariah> hey chat this game gets progressively better
[1:41:40] <jorniev> SO MUCH FIRE IN ZERO G
[1:41:41] <+TheOneCalledRock> yeah, there are quite a few of hidden cod gems. COD ghost is another one
[1:41:42] <%EdenOfLove> I was about to say "Hey, you wanted an all range mode"
[1:41:44] <@Solidus_113> Star Fox Zero is not this
[1:41:45] <%dekkitout> @zalonar Remember, space has no air drag
[1:41:47] <%Shardlab> So.... Activision. Why have you not just made more starfighter/jet games?
[1:41:49] <+funnyfunnykid> Oh wait don't you got 2 different equipped weapons?
[1:41:51] <skeletonknifefight> for context this game was like the third future cod with jetpacks in a row so a lot of people (not me) were tired of that in general. so this game got more hate than it would have normally
[1:41:55] <the_ugliest_known> Was not expecting this, how’s everybody doin
[1:41:58] <+Shotgundam009> Are there space fights in multiplayer? 👀
[1:41:58] <%Josef_Stryker> FUCK IT UP
[1:42:05] <$serpenttucker> @TheOneCalledRock a LOT of people would disagree (but not me)

[1:42:12] <TigerClaws12> it's so rad
[1:42:13] <%CommanderSqueaks> @skeletonknifefight Seems like Jetpacks are just the tip of the iceberg here.
[1:42:17] <%flarebears> I feel as though if this game didn't have a COD name on it. It would have done so much better
[1:42:22] <%IronBagel1> I don't think there's multiplayer space fights unfortunately
[1:42:28] <Tuna_Can_0> RAMING SPEED
[1:42:32] <%Shardlab> @flarebears It kinda would have
[1:42:37] <Darren716> I mean this game still sold well, it is cod afterall

[1:42:56] <herzogtheanimal> Right I'd actually say the opposite, it did well because it was CoD
[1:43:05] <herzogtheanimal> Critical reception to the trailer did not translate to sales tbh
[1:43:07] <andre11dr> It's sure nice that the ship can regenerate
[1:43:07] <$serpenttucker> Holy FUCK so much debris in space
[1:43:09] <%CommanderSqueaks> "Hey this ship is about to blow up, let's LAND on it."

[2:00:10] <%marrs_bars> where we droppin' comrade?
[2:00:10] <%RioGascar> You’d be surprised
[2:00:12] <@Menitta> IW is definitely the most varied COD game. I just forgot how this is super Gundam
[2:00:12] <tired_fan> No wonder he feels like the ol' Captain
[2:00:12] <Darren716> Like you get actual back story in the blops 1 ones
[2:00:18] <herzogtheanimal> There's an entire file system for BO1 in the menu
[2:00:20] <%CommanderSqueaks> As a person with ADHD, I take offense to that
[2:00:22] <Mrthefro> Is it too late to say why Infinite Warfare?
[2:00:24] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> i mean, the best campaigns imo were cod 5 and black ops
[2:00:30] <%CommanderSqueaks> WE LIKE READING.... sometimes
[2:00:32] <sexdrugsvideogames> v is traitor confimed
[2:00:32] <%CommanderSqueaks> Occasionally

[2:01:05] <tired_fan> The Ship Is a gun I'm calling it now
[2:01:06] <gamewarden92> People think of that parody game they made for Bulletstorm when they think of COD.

[2:02:00] <sexdrugsvideogames> why is this OMAR takin the lead!? /s
[2:02:06] <Admiral_PopnFresh> its interesting that they have Jump tech without gates or mass-relay-like machines, but aren't outside the solar system

[2:02:57] <$BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[2:02:59] <%flarebears> I would actually love a Strategy game like this. You command the ship then when it's time it pans over a holo map that then changes to realistic.
[2:02:59] <%RioGascar> since cod is cod it doesnt show back up
[2:02:59] <DSD24> Wow V

[2:03:11] <+MrProw> Infinite warfare? whaaa
[2:03:15] <%flarebears> in between battles you walk around the ship
[2:03:18] <amiavamp> That gun had some Saints Rows 3 upgrades applied to it
[2:03:20] <brachydios777> LUL
[2:03:26] <stormhawk9891> Look at that space Vector
[2:03:43] <%flarebears> I wish a sci-fi strategy game would get this much money
[2:03:43] <sexdrugsvideogames> the karma dude!
[2:03:47] <%EdenOfLove> Trojan outlines

[2:03:50] <therakishsage> A lazer AK. Amazing.
[2:03:59] <sexdrugsvideogames> call your build karma is a bitch
[2:04:12] <%ZeroCruz> Well this a weird pick for a game, interesting tho.
[2:04:16] <derap41> Suppressor is pointless in singleplayer
[2:04:20] <mark1247> quick QA for the chat, i heard from the podcast this week, that WoolieVersus played Furi but does anyone know if he beat it or not? thanks
[2:04:23] <%marrs_bars> @stormhawk9891 lmao right? space vector is best vector I suppose
[2:04:30] <Darren716> Nope you can use both, but dont ned the supressor on non stealth missions
[2:04:35] <+MaddyCaddy> Space P90!
[2:04:39] <%holefek> KPOPlove
[2:04:40] <brachydios777> @therakishsage when you need to kill ever mother fucker in the room! Accept no substitutes
[2:04:42] <stormhawk9891> That ones jus a space P90
[2:04:56] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> wait what happened to the laser gun?
[2:04:59] <sexdrugsvideogames> @mark1247 sry no idea
[2:05:00] <derap41> That Vector makes no sense
[2:05:06] <+MaddyCaddy> Shhhh.
[2:05:08] <DSD24> "Remember that switching to your pistol is always faster than reloading"
[2:05:16] <+funnyfunnykid> ah huh?
[2:05:16] <skeletonknifefight> a trojan boy, eh
[2:05:17] <+Dragoneye77> stealth missions
[2:05:21] <%marrs_bars> switching to your pistol is faster than reloading btw
[2:05:23] <Darren716> Stealth missions yeah
[2:05:29] <KnightAsteran> "Your watermelon killin skills are remarkable"
[2:05:29] <Hawkbone_> If the mission requires a supressor it'll just give you one for free
[2:05:35] <Hawkbone_> even if you don't select one
[2:05:41] <sexdrugsvideogames> yes! space P90! like maddy said
[2:05:41] <@Solidus_113> Surpressor usually makes it so you're targeted less often in firefights
[2:05:44] <derap41> This is where the budget went
[2:05:45] <brachydios777> “Knife the watermelon “
[2:05:46] <$BallerSwagBro9k> THIS IS RAD
[2:05:53] <sexdrugsvideogames> sounds fun
[2:05:53] <$BallerSwagBro9k> WAY BETTER THAN MW 2019
[2:05:56] <black_pariah> @mark1247 its not on the channel so prob a one off
[2:06:03] <brachydios777> Cool
[2:06:04] <+Soliloquy123> Okay this is cool
[2:06:04] <sexdrugsvideogames> the sound of the suppressor
[2:06:05] <%Javaa01> And each different class of gun has different levels of auto aim snap angle
[2:06:07] <+MrProw> chat, is this game ACTUALLY fun?
[2:06:07] <Hawkbone_> Not unless you got Deadshot Daiquiri
[2:06:12] <Hawkbone_> Yes
[2:06:15] <%Javaa01> So SMGs will snap from a MUCH wider angle
[2:06:16] <amiavamp> My god we're really at the point where Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019) is an actual title
[2:06:17] <sexdrugsvideogames> nor feelin it
[2:06:18] <+Dragoneye77> man woolie is not used to schut
[2:06:30] <+Andrizzleton> this game is sick

[2:07:03] <derap41> @Dragoneye77 I didn't want to be the guy that said it but yeah
[2:07:05] <halfmasks> electric bullets? lasers?
[2:07:14] <+AJ_Cherenkov> I completely missed the VR firing range when I played and I am VERY UPSET AT THIS
[2:07:24] <DSD24> Where's the Red Comet?
[2:07:30] <NeroInfinite> yeah youg et some cool ones
[2:07:31] <amiavamp> wheres the vape decal
[2:07:38] <Admiral_PopnFresh> You gamers like CUSTOMIZATION!?
[2:07:39] <halfmasks> @Admiral_PopnFresh i feel like theyd keep the same controls on future guns anyways for easy training
[2:07:47] <sexdrugsvideogames> do you get drones?
[2:07:48] <halfmasks> ngl its just cause its a cool style
[2:07:57] <Darren716> Ok chat gun to your head, best create a class system?
[2:07:57] <Daxalog> How much would be required to PAIN THAT.
[2:07:58] <Pillagius> Wooly do you think you can make Virgin Victory out of this rusty bucket?
[2:08:07] <mark1247> @sexdrugsvideogames @black_pariah thanks for answering at least, ive seen the one off, but they could always played on there own time. wish i didnt have to spend 7$ for the bit reading for woolie to answer QA at the beginning / end of the stream
[2:08:13] <derap41> High Speed Low Drag always the way to go
[2:08:29] <Darren716> Blops 2 had this
[2:08:29] <@Solidus_113> not for campaign
[2:08:30] <%masterfire23> why did people hate this game, its a lot more interesting than the generic war fantasy were getting now
[2:08:33] <Daxalog> I liked Black ops allowing you to just unlock what you want. But Pick 10...
[2:08:36] <skeletonknifefight> some cod games do
[2:08:38] <Ghosthand246> Black ops 2 and 3 has it
[2:08:51] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @halfmasks I can definitely see that for conventional firearms, but again, what need for that is there if the gun is full energy? unless the Volk does still have ammunition rather than battery charge
[2:08:53] <sexdrugsvideogames> @mark1247 noproblem
[2:08:53] <brachydios777> Blops 2 does
[2:09:04] <+MaddyCaddy> Piss off your armorer and always drop your equipment
[2:09:10] <+wmeldrum> yo I adore this campaign
[2:09:11] <herzogtheanimal> Black Ops series isn't really a war fantasy, life sucks for all your characters, war is hell and imperialism is stupid
[2:09:12] <andre11dr> Iea Blops 2 and 3 had it
[2:09:14] <DSD24> Is her name Salter?
[2:09:14] <bigshedman> Yoo cool robot PogChamp
[2:09:18] <amiavamp> In CoD ammo is scarce so a lot of times you pick up a gun just because you're out of ammo
[2:09:18] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @masterfire23 well, cod boys hated it. Cod boys also don't play the campaign, only multiplayer/zombies. And apparently the MP sucked testes
[2:09:20] <herzogtheanimal> WaW is DEFINITELY not a war fantasy
[2:09:24] <+doctordunno> top... menm
[2:09:25] <+jiggy_snipe> Nora Salter I think
[2:09:48] <@Solidus_113> yeeee
[2:09:48] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1318434198781386755
[2:09:54] <%ZeroCruz> Shoot robot
[2:09:55] <DSD24> I just thought of Saber Alter from Fate so its cool that's actually a name
[2:09:55] <TigerClaws12> smooth, ethan
[2:09:57] <sexdrugsvideogames> @masterfire23 the game had good reviews and was even praised. maybe players wanted more "realism"
[2:09:59] <+Dragoneye77> discount M4
[2:09:59] <derap41> M4
[2:10:00] <+MaddyCaddy> Space M4
[2:10:01] <coreybom> @masterfire23 Primarily because people LIKE that solider fantasy. And people were looking to fall COD, not titanfall.
[2:10:02] <Ghosthand246> Ethan is the best
[2:10:03] <halfmasks> AR-15
[2:10:06] <Admiral_PopnFresh> M4 carbine
[2:10:07] <Hawkbone_> NV6
[2:10:08] <zamzoph> M-4?
[2:10:11] <%Josef_Stryker> Ethan is the best
[2:10:15] <Darren716> Man look at these not warthogs
[2:10:15] <+Dragoneye77> God V is so gun illiterate
[2:10:16] <Hawkbone_> NV4
[2:10:23] <NeroInfinite> The M4 not AR-15 that's the civilian version
[2:10:27] <herzogtheanimal> Always hated how "tacticool" the MW games are
[2:10:28] <derap41> AR-15 is a civilian Semi automatic variant
[2:10:35] <%A_DEAD_SHOW> "Twosday innit?"
[2:10:35] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[2:10:37] <+doctordunno> ah, robo-racism

[2:10:52] <zamzoph> it's okay, robots aren't people
[2:10:56] <TigerClaws12> when's back of the bus? Kappa
[2:10:56] <+Dova573> Toasters have no feelings
[2:10:57] <Darren716> Because they were sick of future cod
[2:10:58] <sexdrugsvideogames> thats pats face!
[2:11:01] <+shadowace2400> I mean, he's been fighting bots a whole lot of the time
[2:11:03] <Darren716> After like 4 games of it
[2:11:04] <andre11dr> Back to the robo bus with you
[2:11:04] <+Dova573> Just ask Aegis Kappa
[2:11:05] <amiavamp> The near future cyberpunk of Blops2, etc was always way more interesting than brown dusty village with M16s
[2:11:10] <derap41> This was the trailer mission right
[2:11:10] <+doctordunno> it's weird that he's this racist against robots when this is like, the first actual intelligent one
[2:11:14] <RichochetForce> @dabuhman96 Because it wasn't their mindless COD of the year.
[2:11:24] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @DSD24 I still can't believe Clone Wars of all things came up with the best Robot Racisim slure
[2:11:29] <Admiral_PopnFresh> slur*
[2:11:29] <RichochetForce> @doctordunno Racism and bigotry aren't rational.
[2:11:30] <herzogtheanimal> People were racist against Data
[2:11:36] <+lazysaiyajin> tahats cod
[2:11:37] <herzogtheanimal> Racism isn't rational
[2:11:37] <Torivore> Ethan's head looks like a mix between a Titanfall Marvin head and a Halo mk 5 helmet
[2:11:39] <%D00msDayDan> Ethan is the goodest boy
[2:11:40] <halfmasks> VERY HOT
[2:11:43] <coreybom> @dabuhman96 COD fans like modern and old school military, and this was a little too far in the future for their taste.
[2:11:46] <DSD24> @Admiral_PopnFresh No kidding
[2:11:47] <Darren716> Like think about this, from 2012 through 2016 we had future cod every year
[2:11:48] <bearwagon> we F&F7 tho?
[2:11:56] <+doctordunno> dune buggying in the finest star trek tradition
[2:11:57] <amiavamp> This year also had the CoD4 remake
[2:11:57] <derap41> Drive By!
[2:12:01] <+Dragoneye77> NA aim
[2:12:02] <+bigslinglelino> @dabuhman96 because the multiplayer is pretty dogshit and thats what people buy cod for
[2:12:04] <RichochetForce> Paul Walker died in one of those moon rovers.

[2:12:39] <@Menitta> I'm glad they did COD WW2. I'm glad some developer tried to make a world war 2 game. cant believe nobody tried that yet
[2:12:39] <RichochetForce> Space Trolley
[2:12:49] <sexdrugsvideogames> that was your gameplay
[2:12:59] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @Menitta Kappa
[2:13:01] <+funnyfunnykid> oh hey, We're in Terminal
[2:13:02] <herzogtheanimal> WW2 was pretty lame ngl
[2:13:05] <andre11dr> Woolie after playing 6 Halo games, still has the aim of a plant
[2:13:09] <sexdrugsvideogames> space jeep
[2:13:09] <coreybom> @richochetforce I mean, People like to play COD for COD, not exactly titanfall. And I love titanfall, but i can understand the want for something else than this was.
[2:13:10] <+Dova573> Space Terminal
[2:13:11] <herzogtheanimal> Especially when WaW did that setting so perfectly years ago

[2:13:19] <herzogtheanimal> A decade before in fact
[2:13:21] <Darren716> I mean at least CoD WW2 came out when there were very few WW2 games
[2:13:25] <+jiggy_snipe> Ethan's cool tho D:
[2:13:26] <halfmasks> typical captain protocol!
[2:13:30] <Admiral_PopnFresh> I love how they float! That's such good detail!

[2:13:52] <skeletonknifefight> the game cannot keep up with woolies l33t skills
[2:13:54] <Hawkbone_> I have never seen that

[2:13:57] <herzogtheanimal> What kinda hard drive yall running
[2:13:59] <%ZeroCruz> BANG THE ROBOT

[2:14:46] <Darren716> Heyy its the Dead Space 2 tech
[2:14:47] <DSD24> That's some Dead SPace 2 shit
[2:14:47] <BlackermanZX> doodWAT
[2:14:47] <bigshedman> Yoo we Dead Space 2 now PogChamp
[2:14:49] <gamewarden92> Why the fuck would they use glass!?
[2:14:49] <derap41> Seem like a really big design flaw
[2:14:57] <+funnyfunnykid> You like Titanfall?
[2:14:59] <Admiral_PopnFresh> This feel like a huge OSHA violation
[2:15:06] <%CommanderSqueaks> COAST GUARD!?
[2:15:07] <derap41> Where do you think they stole the idea from
[2:15:09] <RichochetForce> OSHA doesn't exist in the future.
[2:15:16] <+Feralspirit41> YEAH THE COAST GUARD IN SPACE
[2:15:16] <%CommanderSqueaks> What fucking COAST are they guarding?
[2:15:16] <%r0chelimit> It's slower titanfall
[2:15:20] <@Menitta> its definitely slower than Titanfall though
[2:15:21] <Darren716> This came out like a month after tf2 didnt it?
[2:15:23] <+Dragoneye77> V the liar once again
[2:15:24] <iosephe> Where it belongs
[2:15:25] <amiavamp> OSHA no longer exists in Space Space, we pulled the funding because it wasn't very Space Capitalism
[2:15:27] <%FuqBoiSlim> wow I can't believe titanfall ripped off cod
[2:15:29] <+jiggy_snipe> the Space Coast
[2:15:32] <halfmasks> Space Coast
[2:15:37] <%ringabal> Oh man, they built the Moon museum AROUND the flag
[2:15:37] <@Menitta> Its more of a tactical option than a movement one
[2:15:38] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @CommanderSqueaks there are seas on the moon Kappa
[2:15:43] <herzogtheanimal> space force got that good tech
[2:15:43] <RichochetForce> @amiavamp Pretty much. OSHA in this future was viewed as anti-American
[2:15:46] <sexdrugsvideogames> hahahahaha
[2:15:53] <NotHereToStream> can you do a jump back slide
[2:16:13] <derap41> RoE?
[2:16:15] <zamzoph> lots of cool movement shit you can do *hinds behind barrier*
[2:16:23] <NotHereToStream> in advanced warfare you had airdashes
[2:16:33] <+Dragoneye77> why would they make glass in space not bullet proof
[2:16:34] <%CommanderSqueaks> @zamzoph It's still COD, after all
[2:16:34] <+funnyfunnykid> Think the Volk would do better in longer distances
[2:16:37] <@Menitta> Titanfall 1 was Q1 2014 and BO3 (which has the same wallrunning) was 2015
[2:16:40] <DSD24> Yeah that seems absurd
[2:16:54] <+xdeathknightx> V it is the law that you have to say "shoot the glass" like hans gruber"
[2:16:54] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:16:56] <+Mrbaconator> SHOOT. THE GLASS
[2:16:57] <%ZeroCruz> SHOOT DA GLASS
[2:16:58] <DSD24> At least in Dead Space it was in construction glass windows
[2:16:58] <Hawkbone_> It took like 20 bullets to break that glass
[2:17:03] <%Lion_kun> SHOOT. THE GLASS
[2:17:04] <@Menitta> SHOOT. THE GLASS
[2:17:06] <Explodincatz> not yet
[2:17:06] <sexdrugsvideogames> @ringabal smart
[2:17:10] <RichochetForce> Rational space stations would have no glass on exterior facing walls
[2:17:13] <brachydios777> SHOOT DA GLASS
[2:17:22] <Daxalog> Is anyone actually going to put that chip in their brain?
[2:17:30] <+TheBigO75> Hell no
[2:17:30] <+funnyfunnykid> OH THIS ONE FUCKS
[2:17:34] <RichochetForce> @Daxalog Too late, Dax. You're already chipped.
[2:17:36] <sexdrugsvideogames> a museum totally would have windows
[2:17:38] <Daxalog> NOOOO
[2:17:46] <+TheBigO75> Amazon ads beamed directly to your eyes.
[2:17:51] <Daxalog> Actually, being chipped is okay :)
[2:17:53] <+xdeathknightx> Pat is gonna do it because it is his first step to becoming a robot
[2:17:54] <amiavamp> casually strolling into a firefight
[2:17:56] <mark1247> wow
[2:17:59] <RichochetForce> @TheBigO75 Imagine pop up ads blocking your view while driving.
[2:18:02] <andre11dr> I don't fucking trust Elon ,he named his kis a bunch of numbers
[2:18:10] <Hawkbone_> Woolie hates the volk
[2:18:16] <amiavamp> Red jelly is the true villain of CoD
[2:18:17] <%CommanderSqueaks> Bezos popping in your eyes going "Death is no disgrace, buy Prime today."
[2:18:34] <DSD24> Hackerman
[2:18:37] <Slim_Lipid> ANELE ?
[2:18:42] <RichochetForce> That's pretty nice of Bezos. BezOS would probably just auto-subscribe you to Amazon Prime.
[2:19:27] <Admiral_PopnFresh> the light up on the Picatinny rails is sick
[2:19:40] <skeletonknifefight> hmmm
[2:19:46] <%CommanderSqueaks> Trying to sleep, Bezos going "Have you heard of Amazon Fresh?"
[2:19:54] <amiavamp> i was 99% sure the rocket was going to hit the window frame
[2:20:15] <sexdrugsvideogames> yeaaah
[2:20:26] <Admiral_PopnFresh> that's 2 times Woolie would have died if V had not screamed GRENADE
[2:20:27] <derap41> Woolie getting flustered
[2:20:28] <%Josef_Stryker> Oh man
[2:20:31] <Hawkbone_> F
[2:20:41] <%ringabal> THE UNIVERSAL TRUTH
[2:20:50] <amiavamp> "WE'RE EVIL" - Proverb. yeah, a proverb. subtlety.
[2:20:50] <%Javaa01> In CoD games, your friendlies only move forward when you hit progress triggers
[2:20:54] <Darren716> They dont save after death, you gotta find them again
[2:21:01] <NotHereToStream> thats just the KSG 12
[2:21:02] <%Javaa01> So they will not move forward on their own, ever
[2:21:08] <Admiral_PopnFresh> splatter
[2:21:24] <+lazysaiyajin> model 1887
[2:21:26] <NotHereToStream> model 1887 in mw2
[2:21:31] <%Josef_Stryker> Spas-12 in MW2 still my fave shotgun
[2:21:31] <Hawkbone_> 725
[2:21:31] <aluddss> 725
[2:21:34] <a_reused_meme> 725
[2:21:35] <skeletonknifefight> the 725
[2:21:36] <El_GhostV1> 725
[2:21:36] <derap41> It all depends on if its pump action or not
[2:21:37] <$BallerSwagBro9k> 725
[2:21:37] <+funnyfunnykid> It is a hunting shotgun
[2:21:40] <$BallerSwagBro9k> ITS STILL IS
[2:21:43] <Darren716> I miss the AA-12 from mw3
[2:21:46] <$BallerSwagBro9k> THEY "NERFED"
[2:21:47] <+JingKaisean> it's still good with slugs
[2:21:48] <$BallerSwagBro9k> IT
[2:21:52] <NeroInfinite> 725 got the 'fix'
[2:21:53] <DSD24> Modern Warfare has that auto shotgun they added recently
[2:21:53] <@Menitta> I like the EVA 08 in titanfall
[2:21:56] <MAX116030> a 2 shot shotgun its still broken
[2:21:58] <amiavamp> And then theres the Bulldog from Ghosts which invalidates every other shotgun in its game
[2:22:00] <Hawkbone_> And yet they refuse to buff the pump action
[2:22:01] <Dodolo212> OH NO IW
[2:22:01] <+newmanq22> 725 was broken first week of MW
[2:22:03] <Admiral_PopnFresh> I'm not gonna lie, the pew pew makes the AK so much cooler, I'm so easily amused
[2:22:15] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @Darren716 They just brought it to MW 2019. But its called the JAK 12
[2:22:17] <aluddss> 725 but you may be thinking of Olympia from BO1
[2:22:28] <@Menitta> the problem with most shotguns in cod is that they turn into marshmallow guns beyond 2 meters
[2:22:37] <+newmanq22> 725 and the olympia are the same model of DB shotguns
[2:22:38] <DSD24> Everyone is using the JAK 12 on MW
[2:22:50] <Hawkbone_> I wish the pump action shotty in MW2019 was any good without needing 7 range mods
[2:23:02] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @DSD24 The Frag Rounds are straight up broken

[2:30:33] <Exodusprime1256> mark Henry's THE WALL
[2:30:34] <amiavamp> I remember some weird anti-sniper strat I tried was using a shield + a LMG in one game, just walk around casually absorbing sniper shots until you're behind cover, then unload in their general direction
[2:30:42] <Louie_Salmon> I mean you have two slots, so you can literally do both
[2:30:43] <NiktenKing> there is n ammo box so why not

[2:33:42] <Daxalog> Imperial Gaurd
[2:33:46] <%Josef_Stryker> No collectibles in this game besides weapons
[2:33:51] <amiavamp> Is Ethan designed from the ground up to be a soldier, or is he a volunteer soldier?
[2:33:52] <Torivore> Ethan is just a Titanfall spectre
[2:34:12] <Hawkbone_> Nope, for the frag grenades
[2:34:14] <Daxalog> You can upgrade your hack to get bigger robots
[2:34:15] <skeletonknifefight> i think they made him to be a soldier

[2:38:20] <+MaddyCaddy> Shit's fun though
[2:38:21] <%CommanderSqueaks> An entire magazine put 5 inches to the left of robit. LUL
[2:38:28] <rsg220> yeah but what if you're a robit
[2:38:34] <%EdenOfLove> woolz get the mauler back your out of ammo
[2:38:41] <sexdrugsvideogames> @Aheg0d everything to not become a vtuber
[2:38:43] <amiavamp> This is why the M14 is no longer used in its original context as a full-auto battle rifle lol
[2:38:45] <skeletonknifefight> poor guy
[2:38:50] <+zetaplus> yeah no one goes full auto
[2:39:06] <%CommanderSqueaks> @amiavamp You mean the M16? The m14 is a semi-automatic rifle from WW2.
[2:39:07] <@Menitta> Gun ranges are super fun
[2:39:08] <andre11dr> Big caliber will fuck your wrist you fuck around with one with really bad recoil
[2:39:23] <Darren716> M14 isnt from ww2, it wasnt made til like the 50s
[2:39:29] <Darren716> And m14s can go full auto
[2:39:40] <%RioGascar> I really wish cod did continue into the space future stuff
[2:39:47] <+Aheg0d> @sexdrugsvideogames man next month ill see him playing wow at this pace
[2:39:47] <%RioGascar> You can tell the devs were excited to do this
[2:39:49] <Admiral_PopnFresh> I shot a Sten Mk. V before, felt like how he's describing it
[2:39:51] <Hawkbone_> @CommanderSqueaks The M14 is DEFINITELY not from WW2
[2:39:53] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Will the roubles ever be over?
[2:39:53] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Darren716 Correct, but also not used in most modern militaries.
[2:39:56] <sexdrugsvideogames> hahahaha
[2:39:57] <derap41> Safety first
[2:40:03] <Darren716> Theyre actually stupid expensive
[2:40:06] <sexdrugsvideogames> or minecraft
[2:40:09] <Darren716> Like from ny to florida is $500
[2:40:09] <derap41> Getting out is easy getting back in
[2:40:11] <+Story_Ark> Also means having to go to florida
[2:40:16] <+Aheg0d> true lol
[2:40:18] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Save yourselves, Canada
[2:40:20] <+Story_Ark> and I live in florida
[2:40:25] <%insomniacCoder> logged in to resub. Boy you better not be using a controller like a casual cod player
[2:40:30] <Darren716> They were cheap a few months back but they shot back up
[2:40:34] <Slim_Lipid> So many Americans getting ass blasted while driving to Alaska LUL LUL LUL
[2:40:34] <+jiggy_snipe> trained professional, correct
[2:40:36] <amiavamp> @CommanderSqueaks M14 was used in Vietnam era
[2:40:36] <+MaddyCaddy> What a cool RSO
[2:40:38] <+Kqha4000> Is this on PC with a controller?
[2:40:41] <+Story_Ark> "shot" back u0
[2:40:44] <+Story_Ark> *up
[2:40:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> @amiavamp Yup, that was my bad.
[2:40:52] <%dekkitout> Casual, 2/3 platforms use controller ffs
[2:41:08] <tanarath> the door thing is for grenades
[2:41:18] <aluddss> can't tech the nade LUL
[2:41:22] <Exodusprime1256> keep them dirty Americans out of Canada. there bringing their Karen's and their burgers
[2:41:26] <Leddy_at_Home> I love that this gun is literally just an AK with Tech shit all over it
[2:41:27] <brexdq> woolie doesn't like keyboard and mouse
[2:41:31] <%CommanderSqueaks> Woolie is afraid to tech those throws.
[2:41:36] <critfumble_> these guys wish they were the 6-4
[2:41:37] <KingVantq> Wait Woolie's playing infinite warfare im surprised
[2:41:41] <DSD24> I teched that throw!
[2:41:44] <Zayasu> @Kqha4000 yes
[2:41:53] <Darren716> Shotguns with holos and red dots make sense
[2:41:54] <Torivore> The mark of a cool RSO is not liking the NRA
[2:41:57] <Darren716> Ones with zoom tough?
[2:41:58] <gamewarden92> Most videogame shotguns suck
[2:41:59] <%IronBagel1> No but I really did tech it tho
[2:42:00] <Admiral_PopnFresh> I unironically love V saying "Blast 'em" when energy weapons are in play
[2:42:04] <%RioGascar> So a weird thing with this shouldnt you be giving the ordere
[2:42:12] <%RioGascar> since you are captain
[2:42:19] <andre11dr> Shotguns do have long range irl
[2:42:20] <%insomniacCoder> @kingvantq yeah, not starting with 4
[2:42:21] <+IxDomxI> personally, V prefers the air.
[2:42:26] <%SilverDevilfish> Ssssh no logic, only tacticool
[2:42:37] <42nfl19> [Is Ethan still best boy?] (Y/N)
[2:42:42] <%RioGascar> Shotguns in video games are not like real shotguns
[2:42:46] <%ringabal> Can you eat it?
[2:42:46] <DSD24> Is Woolie's callsign Mobius 1?

[2:42:58] <%CommanderSqueaks> @42nfl19 [Is Ethan still best boy?] (Y/Y)
[2:42:59] <brexdq> @gamewarden92 doom would disagree
[2:43:01] <amiavamp> Gun to you head, best shotguns, RE4 and Kaede the Eliminator are banned
[2:43:07] <amiavamp> in video games*
[2:43:09] <derap41> Ethan is just pretending to be human but if you're fooled does it really matter?
[2:43:10] <thelonechris> Look at this Star Wars battle
[2:43:11] <Hawkbone_> Doom Eternal.
[2:43:18] <Torivore> Halo 4
[2:43:19] <+Kqha4000> Halo 1 Shotgun

[2:43:27] <%cobalt_phoenix_> i wanna make a cool space fighter game but i do not know how
[2:43:36] <Darren716> I really like the saints row 2 pimpcane
[2:43:39] <Admiral_PopnFresh> speaking of ARM, these spires absolutely feel like a Star Fox multiplayer map
[2:43:42] <Darren716> That thing has insane range
[2:43:55] <+RowenCleric> alternative shotgun, dead space line gun and force gun
[2:43:55] <90k9> Halo ODST playthorugh lookin pretty good
[2:43:58] <%dekkitout> Like a majority of Destiny's shotguns- one of em's a flak cannon
[2:44:05] <amiavamp> Does this have realistic inertia on the flight?
[2:44:17] <@Solidus_113> no
[2:44:18] <amiavamp> instead of airplane flight
[2:44:27] <andre11dr> So how long until Woolie crashes into one of those poles?
[2:44:44] <+Estuko> @Admiral_PopnFresh for some reason the movement gave me flash backs to that one old space shooter, it's got the full 8 directional movement and is kind of hard to control
[2:44:48] <@Menitta> yeah this flight combat is more arcadey than even Ace Combat
[2:44:58] <skeletonknifefight> ah yes the coast guard. for all those moon oceans
[2:45:23] <@Menitta> Well the moon is technically international waters
[2:45:23] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts

[2:45:27] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @Estuko Shattered Horizon?
[2:45:31] <Torivore> What is space if not one big ocean?
[2:45:31] <skeletonknifefight> wait, the sea of tranquility, thats actually a really good pun
[2:45:35] <skeletonknifefight> ok im on board
[2:45:42] <RyuShinden> Water was discovered on the Moon right? doodWAT
[2:45:48] <amiavamp> This makes me wish Space Engineers was this
[2:45:52] <@Menitta> remember that time Matt Damon was a Mars Pirate
[2:46:11] <%dekkitout> Molecularly speaking, probably water- in the conventional sense yeah sure
[2:46:15] <andre11dr> @ryushinden Yea ,but it's frozen

[2:49:24] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> i mean you do still need to use cover
[2:49:37] <%cobalt_phoenix_> is the shooting pushing you back?

[2:49:49] <%cobalt_phoenix_> good
[2:49:59] <amiavamp> who needs RCS when you have schuut
[2:50:00] <DianaTheAscian> Woolie gonna knock this out in one session?
[2:50:01] <%ChoculaUltra> can we all agree that space gunfights are automatically cooler than regular earth gunfights
[2:50:04] <%RioGascar> At least it looks like it’s pushing him back

[2:50:37] <%ChoculaUltra> this was the one with Jon Snow in it?
[2:50:40] <Darren716> Yeahh im not paying 60 bucks for the campaign
[2:50:41] <@Menitta> I'm gonna reinstall this game right now
[2:50:44] <NotHereToStream> homing too
[2:50:45] <%RioGascar> and cod cold war is doing some interesting things again
[2:50:49] <andre11dr> Iea i remember those from Advanced
[2:50:51] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Is Killzone like this?
[2:50:51] <aluddss> played this when it released, but never saw it like this, think the anti hype got me
[2:50:52] <%RioGascar> like a non-linear campaign
[2:50:55] <$RunningNGunning> Activision doesn't need my money tbh
[2:50:57] <+zetaplus> you got me there
[2:50:57] <derap41> @ironwall_havoc $5 per hour of gameplay
[2:51:04] <%RioGascar> and multiple endings
[2:51:06] <NeroInfinite> Oh no
[2:51:06] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh fuck
[2:51:08] <%IronBagel1> Watching this makes me wanna replay this game now damn
[2:51:11] <%ChoculaUltra> damn those guys got FUCKED.
[2:51:12] <@Menitta> tbf you can get this game used for real cheap
[2:51:14] <Aussie_Manny> Ohh, is this the Jon Snow one?
[2:51:23] <$BallerSwagBro9k> yes
[2:51:27] <thelonechris> Space war crimes
[2:51:34] <Aussie_Manny> Which is the Kevin Spacey one?
[2:51:34] <%ChoculaUltra> if you're gonna blow me into the vaccuum of space, please just shoot me in the head instead FeelsBadMan
[2:51:45] <amiavamp> but why do they have glass windows
[2:51:45] <PrideOfFiddles> Advanced warfate @Aussie_Manny
[2:51:47] <@Menitta> @Aussie_Manny Advanced Warfare
[2:51:48] <%CommanderSqueaks> This is also why you should never have Windows on a fucking Space ship.
[2:51:50] <+BaronVonFatty> wait uppers just came out on steam
[2:51:53] <Aussie_Manny> Ohh.
[2:51:53] <Hawkbone_> Woolie can't see prompts
[2:51:55] <derap41> Real Space Battle would occur and be decided in miliseconds
[2:51:55] <42nfl19> My biggest question...WHY DO YOU HAVE BRIDGE WINDOWS
[2:51:56] <+mans51> idk the sound in space annoys me
[2:51:57] <@Menitta> That one is also really good
[2:51:59] <PleasantLeech> yeah cod games get super cheap used with age because there's a new one every year.
[2:52:01] <%vaderxyz1970> Why is the bridge not in the center of the ship
[2:52:02] <%PirateDad_> Most sifi universes have big boy shields on their ships
[2:52:03] <@Menitta> Not as varied as this but its good
[2:52:04] <%EdenOfLove> Cpt. Bradley down
[2:52:13] <DianaTheAscian> those ships get fucked all the time
[2:52:13] <Admiral_PopnFresh> the Argama retracts its bridge
[2:52:14] <%ChoculaUltra> why do spaceships need windows period LUL
[2:52:17] <%chiluzza> thats why you dont have windows in space
[2:52:17] <%RioGascar> Some sci fi has blast doors that close down
[2:52:18] <amiavamp> why use windows when you can stick cameras on the outside
[2:52:21] <NeroInfinite> Who do human ships jsut have windows?
[2:52:27] <DatAsuna> oh rad
[2:52:28] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:52:33] <+MaddyCaddy> The Origin
[2:52:33] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Origin
[2:52:34] <PrideOfFiddles> The origin?
[2:52:36] <DatAsuna> sad i missed the start
[2:52:49] <Admiral_PopnFresh> I still need to watch IBO and Narrative
[2:52:49] <PleasantLeech> !uptime
[2:52:50] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 7 minutes
[2:52:50] <+captain_thickthighs> speaking of Gundam what is up with the first two episodes of Turn A Gundam
[2:52:52] <%ChoculaUltra> I honestly blame Star Wars for the whole windows-on-the-bridge thing. Probably happened before that but they're a big target so who cares
[2:52:53] <andre11dr> There sure is
[2:52:56] <DianaTheAscian> i just stated origin last night LUL
[2:52:59] <El_GhostV1> the COD burnout was at its highest on this one, thats why everyone slept on this one
[2:53:01] <derap41> Now Woolie is doing Space War Crimes like a true hero
[2:53:05] <FreedomARX7> need moar Gundam
[2:53:09] <$BallerSwagBro9k> I love how Legion in ME basically says how Geth dont have windows ans humans are dumb for having them LUL
[2:53:09] <BlackermanZX> I have to watch IBO at some point
[2:53:15] <%RioGascar> Well if you blame star wars well
[2:53:15] <+rainlily1245> Star Trek TOS had windows on the Enterprise, it's a very old trope
[2:53:20] <andre11dr> There's like 2000 episodes across all the UC series
[2:53:25] <@Menitta> There's a line in one of the Mass Effect games "Why the hell do you have windows on ships? thats stupid"
[2:53:27] <%FuqBoiSlim> Space-k
[2:53:29] <%RioGascar> You actually would be blaming flash gordon and og star trek
[2:53:33] <+Ches_Neckbeard> is COD doing aliens now? I just got here
[2:53:35] <tanarath> Legion is right, they're a structural weakness
[2:53:36] <andre11dr> Wait more like 1000
[2:53:46] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[2:53:47] <%ChoculaUltra> OG Trek had bridge windows too?! Dammit all.
[2:53:48] <aluddss> almost LUL
[2:53:50] <bearwagon> everytime
[2:53:51] <amiavamp> Also in Mass Effect they mention the Normandy's bridge is in an unorthodox location for a human ship, instead of being a big target on the front
[2:53:55] <Darren716> My favorite part of ME is Legion saying how dumb it is to have windows on a space ship
[2:53:55] <derap41> Bravo Zulu?
[2:53:56] <+lazysaiyajin> damn it LUL
[2:54:02] <PleasantLeech> what's the robot's name again? I love that character.
[2:54:03] <%ringabal> Once again, Woolie prefers the floor to the setpiece
[2:54:06] <@Menitta> Yeah Legion said it
[2:54:09] <Slim_Lipid> Are the only windows on the ISS in the cupola?
[2:54:09] <ChbiHelloween> This is an older COD game @Ches_Neckbeard
[2:54:14] <+funnyfunnykid> The lady speaking reminds me of the one who talks to you in System Shock 2
[2:54:17] <%IronBagel1> Robo buddy's name is Ethan
[2:54:21] <+zetaplus> @pleasantleech Ethan
[2:54:24] <%RioGascar> The windows on the iss are tiny
[2:54:29] <%ChoculaUltra> kinda like how gundam casuals assume the cockpit is in the head but like, the head is a huge fucking target for any mobile suit so its usually the abdomen
[2:54:37] <+funnyfunnykid> YES
[2:54:41] <PleasantLeech> oh it was Ethan, I thought that was too normal to be it lol
[2:54:46] <+JingKaisean> this Halo looks fuckin rad
[2:54:46] <+Ches_Neckbeard> @ChbiHelloween I haven't played a COD since 5. it's all now to me
[2:54:51] <Aussie_Manny> Boop bap beep bop.
[2:54:52] <%ChoculaUltra> unless you're a crazy ass Zeon prototype. I'm looking at you, Sazabi.
[2:54:53] <NotHereToStream> type 2 is a smg hybrid dualwield pistol
[2:54:56] <+funnyfunnykid> Type 2 is an SMG that become 2 MPs
[2:54:59] <PrideOfFiddles> I wish Cod would go full Metal Slug. Just for 1 game :D
[2:55:01] <PleasantLeech> Ethan is best boy hands down
[2:55:04] <derap41> Oh this is a cool gun

[2:55:42] <%ChoculaUltra> @zetaplus to be fair, the Zeong head can be a mobile fighter all on it's own with that firepower LUL
[2:55:58] <PrideOfFiddles> We need a counter# for how many times Woolie throws grenades at himself
[2:55:59] <Ner234> We need a montage of Woolie's grenade fuckups LUL
[2:56:01] <$BallerSwagBro9k> If i had to watch one Gundam series in my life which should it be?
[2:56:01] <+zetaplus> @choculaultra true LUL
[2:56:15] <+funnyfunnykid> There are variants of the Type 2 that have bouncing bullets that makes a corridor living hell for many.
[2:56:18] <rosemon5001> sooo 3 or 2 atempts at this?
[2:56:33] <amiavamp> So SDF is Australia then

[2:57:17] <Darren716> I dont think if you die it scans
[2:57:27] <andre11dr> Also 8 MS team is pretty much that as well
[2:57:32] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Is Tigris just the Pegasus from Battlestar Galactica?
[2:57:39] <%ChoculaUltra> kinda want to see floating blood in zero g like that one scene in ZoE 2. Not a lot of zero g blood now that I think about it.
[2:57:54] <+TheYharnamTheorem> Wow, never thought I'd see an LP of this. Excellent campaign, and I used to FRY in IW multiplayer daphSmile
[2:58:05] <%RioGascar> Policenauts has z g blood
[2:58:17] <%ChoculaUltra> Policenauts was ahead of its time!
[2:58:25] <%RioGascar> Which uh

[3:07:42] <Dave_VD> Wtf you go to other planets in this game?
[3:07:44] <+TheotherKristian> No this is the FUTURE IN WHICH THE SCIENTISTS CHANGED MIND ABOUT PLUTO
[3:07:46] <$BallerSwagBro9k> PLUTO DESERVED BETTER BibleThump
[3:07:49] <rosemon5001> that kind of attitude makes me think the martians were right to defect
[3:07:54] <derap41> CoD is now an RPG
[3:07:56] <$BallerSwagBro9k> LUL

[3:10:03] <%SirGO0SE> i miss red faction
[3:10:07] <jamsbybetty> the USA would NEVER give guns to people that might turn out to be a BAD IDEA LATER
[3:10:07] <RyuShinden> Attacked Genever itself LUL
[3:10:11] <+Riggs_The_Roadie> Like that one guy said, Red Faction secret sequel.
[3:10:12] <jorniev> WHAT ABOUT THE BELTERS
[3:10:14] <%CommanderSqueaks> "Giving weapons to these insurgents clearly won't bite us in the ass in a decade or so"
[3:10:16] <+Soliloquy123> Does the Geneva Convention include "Please don't attack Geneva, guys"
[3:10:44] <+RealThiele> man expanse is ok, but i get tired of the humans bad rehash every season

[3:14:17] <@Menitta> "He thinks the Earth is flat"
[3:14:23] <sexdrugsvideogames> why not straight up salem
[3:14:29] <%CommanderSqueaks> @DatAsuna LUL I see what you did there.

[3:17:57] <%Shardlab> @andre11dr You got Metal Fever, boy! Metal Fever!
[3:18:08] <DianaTheAscian> was this back when only 2 studios made CoD games?
[3:18:14] <%Josef_Stryker> @RioGascar Nah Sledgehammer was a thing since this came out after AW and BO3
[3:18:15] <gamewarden92> @CommanderSqueaks I see on your steam profile that you've 100% cleared Haydee
[3:18:25] <Ner234> Zooomm
[3:18:26] <%RioGascar> Ah
[3:18:28] <derap41> Its a F-35 its not even a good space plane
[3:18:32] <+코코꾸라> @DianaTheAscian No, Sledgehammer was working on CoD WWII when this released
[3:18:41] <DianaTheAscian> k
[3:18:41] <RyuShinden> AMURO. IKIMASU
[3:18:42] <+RealThiele> F-35 mission to hope the plane stays in the air
[3:18:42] <DatAsuna> oh this one
[3:18:47] <%RioGascar> I also imagine they were just pumped as hell to do not modern or ww2 again
[3:18:52] <DianaTheAscian> cool
[3:18:53] <%RioGascar> and do space shit
[3:19:04] <derap41> This is so not CoD
[3:19:07] <%FuqBoiSlim> GRAPPLE HOOK PogChamp
[3:19:08] <%RioGascar> Also NO PAYING GUN MANUFACTURERS
[3:19:11] <+QueequegTheater> Woolie sees a grappling hook and his dick hits the ceiling Kappa
[3:19:12] <aluddss> this game was made for the wrong people
[3:19:13] <PrideOfFiddles> Are enemies going to be hiding in asteroid-baloons? LUL
[3:19:14] <ToneBacas> not quite sniper mission in the snow
[3:19:22] <+RealThiele> this is CoD stabbing titanfall
[3:19:28] <%RioGascar> this is not cod as it is letting you CONTINUE to use mechanics
[3:19:33] <Daxalog> Keep in mind. This was really poorly received at the time.
[3:19:36] <Tuna_Can_0> if they didnt call this a COD game it might have done better imo
[3:19:42] <%Shardlab> All you "boots on ground" bros RUINED this. You ruined the possibilities of more awesome scifi shooters.
[3:19:48] <%RioGascar> Usually cod puts a mechanic out and after a single level its gone the rest of the game
[3:19:52] <RyuShinden> WOAH
[3:19:53] <Lancaster_H> Good night.
[3:19:58] <%IronBagel1> @Shardlab The truth none of the fans want to hear.
[3:20:02] <%dekkitout> @Daxalog Loud normies have low gravity conditions and astrophysics
[3:20:04] <DianaTheAscian> COOL
[3:20:04] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> well i'd expect my laser rifle to be silent
[3:20:07] <NotHereToStream> futuristic m14
[3:20:08] <%dekkitout> *hate
[3:20:08] <gunsrlove> Silenced?? There is no noise in space
[3:20:10] <derap41> Silenced gun in space
[3:20:10] <+zetaplus> god thats cool as fuck
[3:20:11] <%RioGascar> so this is just very different than any cod
[3:20:12] <andre11dr> Could you even hear a gun in space?
[3:20:14] <+RealThiele> @Shardlab chill bruh, gavity is like, just a theory LUL
[3:20:21] <+funnyfunnykid> It's a WIdowmaker gun without the inflating of the ass
[3:20:21] <REGNIERx> dope
[3:20:22] <@Menitta> they're usually like "climb this one wall with magnet glove hands" and then never again
[3:20:26] <ToneBacas> why would they hang so close to these asteroids?
[3:20:29] <%Captain_matt> like If you took the Call of Duty paint off of this game, it would probably be one of my favourite games
[3:20:30] <derap41> @andre11dr only if you held your ear to it
[3:20:33] <amiavamp> space is for nerds bruh, now excuse me while i play fantasy football
[3:20:33] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:20:34] <@Menitta> Or an AC-130
[3:20:38] <%Shardlab> @Shardlab And now they've gotten on the Live Service train and they ain't going back
[3:20:39] <%CommanderSqueaks> @ToneBacas They're trying to hide their prototype spaceship
[3:20:47] <+Riggs_The_Roadie> Does this game just straight up have trick weapons? The fuck?
[3:20:48] <%vaderxyz1970> Wheres the dry dock platform?
[3:20:53] <revoltingimp> so how bad was the multiplayer in this, for people to decide this wasn't a good way for the franchise to go forwards?
[3:20:58] <ChbiHelloween> Silent Assault laser Sniper rilfe.....i´m sorry why did people not like this again????
[3:21:04] <BlackermanZX> HOW the fuck did people dislike this?
[3:21:11] <derap41> Experimental and CoD does not go together¨'
[3:21:14] <skeletonknifefight> the multiplayer wasnt really bad. it was just like...less good bo3
[3:21:14] <@Menitta> The multiplayer has almost none of this interesting stuff
[3:21:18] <%RioGascar> TITANFALL 2 does the same stuff as cod really
[3:21:24] <%dekkitout> They should've built their ship IN an asteroid- like Sidonia, that's shit's cool
[3:21:24] <Hawkbone_> @revoltingimp Literal copy/paste of Black Ops 3, there was absolutely nothing different in the multiplayer
[3:21:33] <%CommanderSqueaks> Don't jerk it
[3:21:34] <%vaderxyz1970> @BlackermanZX Nitpicking
[3:21:35] <infernalram> people had knee jerk reactionsto space cod
[3:21:37] <Slim_Lipid> @ChbiHelloween Because people care about gameplay and not style
[3:21:37] <derap41> hah
[3:21:38] <aluddss> because it wasn't "cod"
[3:21:38] <andre11dr> So this had bad multiplayer right?That was the main thing
[3:21:39] <%RioGascar> mainly the introduce a mechanic for a level and explore it to its full potential
[3:21:39] <NiktenKing> LUL
[3:21:41] <+JingKaisean> penis
[3:21:42] <Tuna_Can_0> dont jerk it Kreygasm
[3:21:45] <BlackermanZX> you really have to fuck up to not include this in multiplayer doodBait
[3:21:46] <@Menitta> No this is definitely different from TF2. The multiplayer is just BO3 again
[3:21:47] <amiavamp> we do that every november
[3:21:57] <%Shardlab> @RioGascar Comparing the cooler, younger brother to this is kinda odd when you think about it
[3:22:00] <BurningAc3s> woolieGASM
[3:22:01] <derap41> OSHA!
[3:22:01] <ToneBacas> no coomers in this sniper squad
[3:22:01] <+RealThiele> Yea CoD and titanfall 2 games released ONE WEEK apart this was Actiblizzs move to kill respawn
[3:22:02] <+jiggy_snipe> CoD is about multiplayer not singleplayer
[3:22:02] <42nfl19> @BlackermanZX Fans wanted more boots on the ground and the series got more and more away from the core gameplay they were familiar with
[3:22:02] <%RioGascar> I mean in its design meni
[3:22:13] <derap41> Working next to active engines
[3:22:15] <BurningAc3s> woolieFUN
[3:22:16] <derap41> big no no
[3:22:19] <%RioGascar> tf2 campaign does the same things as cod does
[3:22:24] <Ner234> Ded
[3:22:31] <derap41> Just some war crimes
[3:22:32] <Ner234> Evil Space Workers
[3:22:33] <Sunstalker> How would they hear in space? DansGame
[3:22:34] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> ah, but they're working for the EVIL side
[3:22:37] <@Menitta> Titanfall 2's campaign is closer to a Valve game
[3:22:38] <sexdrugsvideogames> v is a total military nerd, who'd funk that
[3:22:40] <%Crusherjftw> Crusherjftw subscribed with Prime.
[3:22:40] <Tuna_Can_0> cant wait until 'modern' modern warfare for the big war crimes
[3:22:42] <%dekkitout> @RioGascar Team Fortress 2? LuvUok
[3:22:43] <KaosuHamoni> Woolie that’s not true you fire on the exhale
[3:22:44] <Hawkbone_> Titanfall 2 was literally made by ex CoD devs
[3:22:46] <%Vigonept> the got guns doe
[3:22:46] <$RunningNGunning> They're civil engineers, BUT EVIL
[3:22:50] <%JustYudha> Shushhhhh "workers"
[3:22:50] <+Estuko> Thanks for the KPOPfan @crusherjftw
[3:22:50] <black_pariah> i loved this shit on release
[3:22:56] <Pappajimbo> death star had workers. gotta blow them all up
[3:23:03] <+jiggy_snipe> yea Respawn is ex-IW guys I believe
[3:23:03] <+QueequegTheater> He had a gun, that means I was justified
[3:23:10] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> kash?
[3:23:11] <+QueequegTheater> Woolie the Cop KappaHD
[3:23:13] <KaosuHamoni> If you hold your breath you actually cause involuntary tremors
[3:23:15] <Daxalog> This must be so hot(temp)
[3:23:22] <+RealThiele> @Pappajimbo those Terrorists killed over one million imperial citizens
[3:23:51] <PrideOfFiddles> You hear that sire, it's the sound of money
[3:23:53] <derap41> You're Shooting Your Captain you fuckers
[3:23:58] <Darren716> Youre missing out then
[3:24:03] <Slim_Lipid> The one that's all style and no substance LUL
[3:24:04] <+xerotwo> SPAAAAAAAAAAACE
[3:24:07] <@Menitta> of every cod, this is the one you should play
[3:24:08] <Tuna_Can_0> truee
[3:24:08] <derap41> You're not missing out
[3:24:09] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @WoolieVersus you should at least try cod 5: world at war
[3:24:10] <%Shardlab> This is the future we could have had
[3:24:11] <+QueequegTheater> But MW2 has a straight up anime villain
[3:24:12] <%doomerskeletor13> spaaaaaace
[3:24:13] <+jiggy_snipe> Woolie isn't a military shooter guy
[3:24:17] <%CommanderSqueaks> COD having substance = lol
[3:24:18] <BlackermanZX> not missing out at all
[3:24:20] <%Crusherjftw> i am escaping to the one place that hasn't been corrupted by capitalism SPAAAAAACCCE
[3:24:20] <%ZweihanderSteve> full disrespect though
[3:24:22] <+CaptainMalic> IN space, no one can see you're war crimes
[3:24:24] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[3:24:26] <+jiggy_snipe> tho CoD4 and MW2 had good stories
[3:24:28] <RealDurdyDan> @QueequegTheater True LUL
[3:24:29] <@Menitta> since when did COD have substance
[3:24:30] <%dekkitout> If that's the case, then there's like 3 levels in Destiny 2 at most Woolie would like
[3:24:30] <DatAsuna> BlOps 2 is the blueprint for a lot of this one which is nice
[3:24:33] <DianaTheAscian> LUL LUL LUL
[3:24:34] <jorniev> style goes a long way when its fun
[3:24:36] <%Tenchi_G> BLOPS is ok
[3:24:36] <andre11dr> But it's not really CoD ,it's cool tho
[3:24:37] <derap41> BO1 had a good story
[3:24:41] <+RealThiele> big disrespect and well deserved
[3:24:44] <%eyezehuhh> spilled your jam
[3:24:45] <DatAsuna> MW aged pretty badly imho
[3:24:49] <+CaptainMalic> @Menitta BO1 and BO2
[3:24:54] <derap41> Break the neck of that engineer
[3:24:57] <+QueequegTheater> Jesus that was brutal
[3:24:58] <@Menitta> My statement stands.
[3:24:58] <Hawkbone_> People who say CoD has no substance have never actually played CoD
[3:24:59] <NotHereToStream> you would love advanced warfare...it has air dashes
[3:25:04] <Darren716> I think the MWs and Blops 1 and 2 aged well
[3:25:06] <+CaptainMalic> @DatAsuna How come
[3:25:08] <@Menitta> BO2's story is a mess
[3:25:13] <%FuqBoiSlim> How healthy is the multiplayer for this? People still playing?
[3:25:18] <KaosuHamoni> Cod has no substance tho kappa
[3:25:25] <+QueequegTheater> @Menitta Yeah but it's a fun mess
[3:25:28] <+CaptainMalic> @Menitta I played it. It is good :)
[3:25:28] <andre11dr> Also clearly Activision spent FUCKING MONEY on this
[3:25:28] <derap41> @FuqBoiSlim You can find games but its pretty dead
[3:25:32] <+jiggy_snipe> I imagine the multiplayer is dead
[3:25:48] <Ner234> Damn
[3:25:49] <BlackermanZX> Space war crimes woooo doodNuts
[3:25:51] <%dekkitout> monkaS
[3:25:53] <+CaptainMalic> @jiggy_snipe It came out in 2016 so yeah
[3:25:53] <%FuqBoiSlim> ah, I expected much but that's still a shame
[3:25:53] <Slim_Lipid> @Hawkbone_ It's the people who don't care about the videogame part of the videogame TPFufun
[3:26:02] <+JingKaisean> wait, how do explosions in space work?
[3:26:05] <%Crusherjftw> is it really a war crime if it is in space
[3:26:18] <+jiggy_snipe> yikes
[3:26:18] <+QueequegTheater> "I'm a hero" says man doing a combo
[3:26:18] <%ringabal> OH
[3:26:18] <amiavamp> space crimes are like sky crimes
[3:26:19] <gamewarden92> The knee!
[3:26:19] <+RealThiele> the gasses in his suit would start to explode, then immediately go out
[3:26:19] <zeif00> pew pew pew pew
[3:26:20] <Ner234> @Crusherjftw It's a Space War Crime
[3:26:20] <%dekkitout> Woolie "Widowmaker" Madden has a new meaning
[3:26:23] <+TheotherKristian> No wonder people hated this games, it's so cool
[3:26:23] <+CaptainMalic> @JingKaisean special space grenades
[3:26:25] <redrins> space crimes
[3:26:25] <rsg220> in space no can hear you commit war crimes
[3:26:26] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Crusherjftw They destroyed space Geneva, war crimes don't exist anymore.
[3:26:27] <RealDurdyDan> What happens in space stays in space
[3:26:29] <%Vigonept> space is free territory after all
[3:26:29] <PrideOfFiddles> Captain Falcon knee... In space

[3:27:05] <Jashter18> Earth has outstayed it's welcome is Zeon as fuck
[3:27:07] <tanarath> One day, woolie will understand fire indicators
[3:27:15] <RealDurdyDan> Jesus
[3:27:16] <@Menitta> Its unfortunate because the multiplayer really sucks in this game thus everyone ignored it
[3:27:18] <+mans51> uh 2d fps? which.
[3:27:22] <PrideOfFiddles> @CaptainMalic True, true you got me there LUL
[3:27:27] <sexdrugsvideogames> 6 dof
[3:27:28] <+RealThiele> this game needs more jetpack
[3:27:35] <@Menitta> In addition, this came out the same year as DOOM, Battlefield 1, and Titanfall 2

[3:31:03] <tanarath> Did we arm them with the prototypem
[3:31:12] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Eat your heart out, Star Fox 2!
[3:31:14] <%CommanderSqueaks> Woolie please don't carsh the hyper advanced prototype

[3:32:02] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Chat, what's the coolest fighter/space ship in videogames?
[3:32:04] <Lancaster_H> CoD hasnt been that since years
[3:32:07] <sexdrugsvideogames> ship mounted space shotgun
[3:32:08] <%Vigonept> thats still this though
[3:32:11] <Clundy> Star Trek: Call of Duty
[3:32:13] <%FuqBoiSlim> I mean tbf you're shooting evil foreigners here too but they're space foreigners
[3:32:18] <BlackermanZX> ow doodTerror
[3:32:26] <+jiggy_snipe> I think it's cool that CoD is trying different settings and eras
[3:32:38] <%dekkitout> Here's the thing tho, Martians =/= people SeriousSloth
[3:32:42] <+RealThiele> Incom T-65 X-Wing Starfighter holds a special place in my heart
[3:32:44] <GarbageNirvana> Gundams when
[3:32:57] <%FuqBoiSlim> @dekkitout Your soul is weighed down by Earth's gravity
[3:32:58] <PrideOfFiddles> @AlteisenReiseZ I don't know if it's the coolest, but the Vic Viper from Gradius is a classic
[3:33:00] <Clundy> I want a colonial civil war cod
[3:33:16] <%Captain_matt> @AlteisenReiseZ Swordfish Mk2 from Bebop
[3:33:16] <%dekkitout> GOOD, the gravity's pressure makes it diamond
[3:33:18] <gamewarden92> I feel like I'm watching a video at 2x speed
[3:33:19] <Clundy> They could do cool things with setting and story
[3:33:21] <%Vigonept> horses and muskets
[3:33:22] <NeroInfinite> That's some Ace combat jeeeze
[3:33:25] <+funnyfunnykid> I may do the same...
[3:33:27] <Explodincatz> are we sure this is a CoD game?
[3:33:30] <@Menitta> i'm downloading it right now. this is super cool
[3:33:31] <+jiggy_snipe> Medieval CoD
[3:33:34] <HungryHungryEmu> why is this so sick...
[3:33:35] <%Crusherjftw> god this is making me nauseous
[3:33:38] <%Crusherjftw> woooow
[3:33:47] <%AlteisenReiseZ> I still gotta say the Arwing (specifically the Assault design) is one of the coolest
[3:33:48] <ironwall_havoc> this is Star Citizen in 10 years
[3:33:49] <sexdrugsvideogames> nice
[3:33:57] <%ringabal> YEYEYEYE

[3:34:11] <%CommanderSqueaks> @ironwall_havoc Implying that game even exists.
[3:34:20] <tanarath> six degrees of freedom
[3:34:23] <%Shardlab> And this is a $5 game now?
[3:34:24] <swooty3000> COD better then star fox
[3:34:25] <+funnyfunnykid> Play some Star Fox: Assault music over this and it makes the experience amazing
[3:34:25] <+RealThiele> man that ship looks like SDF-1
[3:34:30] <DatAsuna> I loved both
[3:34:31] <%Kain5707> Squadrons when?
[3:34:32] <Darren716> Has woolie tried squadrons?
[3:34:36] <@Menitta> you can get this game for really cheap used
[3:34:36] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1318434198781386755
[3:34:39] <DatAsuna> Star wars wars squadrons is a weird middle ground between those
[3:34:44] <%FuqBoiSlim> let me go on amazon and look for a bargain copy lmaoo
[3:34:59] <%FuqBoiSlim> I haven't played a cod since mw3 that might change
[3:35:06] <HungryHungryEmu> did the mp HAVE THIS IN IT?
[3:35:15] <+bigslinglelino> Nope
[3:35:19] <+RealThiele> cowards
[3:35:20] <Slim_Lipid> Did you know you can press ⬅️ or ➡️ to rotate?
[3:35:21] <Tuna_Can_0> 12 o clock? where? how?
[3:35:23] <+funnyfunnykid> Young Kim making no mixtape anymore
[3:35:29] <HungryHungryEmu> whoa way to drop the fucking ball
[3:35:31] <$kirin_fellwinter> why do COD campaigns get a bad rep again???
[3:35:34] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[3:35:51] <Tuna_Can_0> no autopilot DansGame
[3:35:52] <+jiggy_snipe> do they get bad reps?
[3:35:55] <sexdrugsvideogames> @Slim_Lipid lolololololol
[3:35:57] <Hawkbone_> @kirin_fellwinter Because people make assumptions without ever actually playing them
[3:35:57] <+bigslinglelino> Because USUALLY they are recycled and bland
[3:36:00] <+RealThiele> Last chance to be a hero, doctor
[3:36:03] <HungryHungryEmu> i mean most of them arent THIS
[3:36:07] <%ringabal> WHAT A MISSION
[3:36:07] <skeletonknifefight> tbf the trailer didnt have ANY of this
[3:36:09] <aluddss> IT WAS MADE FOR THE WRONG PEOPLE
[3:36:14] <derap41> CoD players are Idiots
[3:36:16] <%Shardlab> That damned sheep rejected this hotness
[3:36:17] <@Menitta> It did have the dogfights
[3:36:18] <DianaTheAscian> its just no one talks about them
[3:36:19] <%dekkitout> Normies can't navigate non gravity envionments psaFist
[3:36:25] <+JingKaisean> This was marketed towards people who play 2k and madden
[3:36:25] <+Mrbaconator> cod players are whiny shit babbies
[3:36:27] <@Menitta> "But fuck that muh boots on the ground"
[3:36:30] <%Crusherjftw> Space fox news keeps spouting BS
[3:36:33] <%FuqBoiSlim> I remember the meme of the 2010's being that people just buy COD for the multiplayer and don't even look at the campaigns.
[3:36:33] <HungryHungryEmu> Rebrand this shit and itd be a modern classic wt
[3:36:34] <%Irridium> CoD players HATE fun
[3:36:38] <tanarath> @woolieversus Blast macross while doing dogfights
[3:36:39] <Daxalog> Released in 2016. When people wanted "Boots on the ground, gritty war stuff".
[3:36:39] <iosephe> "I want to play the infinity wars of now, not the future"
[3:36:40] <Bigyanno> Cod player want the same game every year
[3:36:40] <+RealThiele> ok but what if we went back into the fighter
[3:36:52] <+jiggy_snipe> Shouldn't have called it CoD. Branding matters
[3:36:52] <+Draco_Renegade> If this was the first futuristic COD, I think it would've done better.

[3:37:09] <@Menitta> No this is the ONLY one
[3:37:10] <%Huntercd> Space Navy
[3:37:11] <@Solidus_113> CoD players are like Pokemon players if they loved the repeated and cloned gameplay
[3:37:12] <DatAsuna> Black Ops 2
[3:37:22] <skeletonknifefight> bo2 had some weird bad rts side missions, but otherwise nah
[3:37:25] <%kyh9> This looks like exactly what I wanted out of Battlefront 2's campaign
[3:37:31] <%Shardlab> @jiggy_snipe If this was anything else, they could have had a hefty, hefty cool IP on their hands
[3:37:32] <tanarath> This is like black flag
[3:37:34] <%FuqBoiSlim> @daxalog people weren't already sick of that aesthetic by then? I thought overwatch came out that year and blew up because it didn't look like that
[3:37:34] <galagoth> man so many people hated this CoD but this was my fav one
[3:37:34] <derap41> $60 for a 12 hour game tho
[3:37:35] <Hawkbone_> People shit all over CoD campaigns and then get mad when one doesn't have one as if its somehow a surprise
[3:37:37] <%Huntercd> The game is good
[3:37:38] <+funnyfunnykid> Wasn't this gmae worked on Infinity Ward and Raven? Didn't Raven make some goof ass games?
[3:37:39] <%RioGascar> Cod cold war might have mission select
[3:37:39] <%dekkitout> Welcome to CoD when Acti and Bungie were drafting those divorce papers I bet
[3:37:43] <+RowenCleric> im sold
[3:37:44] <%Javaa01> Yeah saving is the one thing you don't have to worry about in CoD, they have that bit figured out
[3:37:52] <+bigslinglelino> Too bad all other campaigns are downhill from here lol
[3:37:52] <ironwall_havoc> but its loading screen on PC though
[3:37:52] <+lazysaiyajin> LUL
[3:37:55] <BlackermanZX> holy shit LUL
[3:37:55] <DatAsuna> Raven made jedi academy
[3:37:58] <%SirGO0SE> BREAK ME DOWN
[3:37:59] <Darren716> Woolie dont sleep on the other CoDs!
[3:37:59] <%ringabal> I can't believe Woolie picked the best mission first
[3:38:01] <Slim_Lipid> It is :)
[3:38:01] <%CommanderSqueaks> @derap41 When was a 12 hour story not worth $60? People are getting fetishes for stupidly long games.
[3:38:02] <+Draco_Renegade> BO4 is the worst
[3:38:03] <andre11dr> This went completely under my radar
[3:38:05] <aluddss> no Ghosts was
[3:38:07] <Bigyanno> This is the least COD-like COD
[3:38:08] <BlackermanZX> LETS GO SPACE WAR CRIMES
[3:38:10] <@Menitta> BO4 is lame as fuck
[3:38:12] <%mukbun> this cod is the best one, I'm glad I played it at launch
[3:38:12] <+RealThiele> this is how they ate titanfalls 2's lunch
[3:38:14] <DatAsuna> hosts is the worst yeah
[3:38:14] <$RunningNGunning> SOMEONE GET THIS MAN his can of Mountain Dew and a bag of doritos
[3:38:15] <+zetaplus> @CommanderSqueaks agreed
[3:38:15] <%Shardlab> "Buh mah multiplayah, tho'"
[3:38:17] <sexdrugsvideogames> get it for series x backward compatible
[3:38:19] <derap41> @CommanderSqueaks was more complaining that CoD games never go on sale
[3:38:23] <Blank9> nowhere to go but up
[3:38:23] <+Riggs_The_Roadie> Black Ops 2, sort of. It had optional side missions in addition to loadouts.
[3:38:26] <sexdrugsvideogames> hahahahahahaha
[3:38:28] <+SuicidalLemmming> well it is, the part that matters the multiplayer. story is a good one tho
[3:38:29] <%Javaa01> BO4 doesn't have a campaign, it has bot matches
[3:38:32] <%CommanderSqueaks> @derap41 I play Nintendo games, you'll get no sympathy from me.
[3:38:33] <%Crusherjftw> imagine a mass effect game in this style
[3:38:35] <+clonexsniper> but this cod or titanfall 2
[3:38:35] <%Vigonept> all thats missing is gundams
[3:38:38] <Gelphaze> Commander Woolie on deck!
[3:38:40] <%Crusherjftw> IMAGINE IT
[3:38:45] <Daxalog> I remember it was the most prevailing comment. "Why did they do this?" Overwatch and other games were big at the time so people saw this another "future, fantastical" game.
[3:38:49] <%dekkitout> I bet TF3 woulda had Titans in space that could transform PunOko
[3:38:55] <%Irridium> @CommanderSqueaks Is Skyward Sword still $50?
[3:39:01] <DatAsuna> I was pushing for an IW playthrough so I'm happy
[3:39:09] <HungryHungryEmu> Too bad this iteration is dead..
[3:39:09] <@Solidus_113> Dave Chappelle in the club with the palm on the face
[3:39:10] <Slim_Lipid> Single-player shooters LUL
[3:39:12] <andre11dr> Remember, people buy these games only for the multiplayer and never touch the campain
[3:39:15] <skeletonknifefight> a lot of the hate for this game happened before they revealed any of the really cool space stuff
[3:39:28] <skeletonknifefight> like the original trailer wasnt very good, and i love this game
[3:39:38] <%Shardlab> They should have just made this single player and sold them a map pack for the last game
[3:39:38] <Darren716> I totally get why people were put off since this was like the 5th year in a row of future shit
[3:39:40] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Irridium No, it's 20 bucks, but it's also last console generation and 5 years old.
[3:39:50] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Irridium 9 years old.
[3:39:54] <@Menitta> Plus Battlefield 1
[3:40:01] <@Menitta> but BF1 is terrible
[3:40:04] <%dekkitout> Now I wanna install Strike Suit Zero
[3:40:20] <%SirGO0SE> cool guys fly past explosions LuvCool
[3:40:21] <LycheeMusings> You should play Ace combat then
[3:40:27] <+jiggy_snipe> did they not show any of the dogfighting?
[3:40:31] <%ringabal> Making the lock-on a rail shooter was a perfect idea
[3:40:33] <@Solidus_113> Ace Combat takes more work than this to play
[3:40:34] <+RowenCleric> He did ace combat 7
[3:40:38] <andre11dr> Well you better enjoy it ,because it's dead and never returning
[3:40:39] <Safarihat> if only there was more dogfighting in ace combat
[3:40:46] <+RealThiele> i wanted Dreadnaught to play more fluid like that
[3:40:49] <%RioGascar> You would fucking love star wars squadrons then ITS GOT A FUN ASS VR MODE TOO and whole game in VR
[3:40:53] <dungpie64> I am seeing this right ? Call of duty ? Didn't know you had it in you
[3:40:53] <DatAsuna> Cod started as a big PC thing
[3:40:53] <Bigyanno> because FPS games are better with a mouse
[3:40:55] <Tuna_Can_0> thems fightin words Kappa
[3:40:56] <Lancaster_H> so you can actually A I M
[3:41:00] <DatAsuna> OG cod was real PC hours
[3:41:10] <%Javaa01> WASD/mouse for strafe and aim, Q/E for roll control
[3:41:11] <+funnyfunnykid> I use Keyboard for shooting and Space Battle only for controller for me.
[3:41:14] <regular_jim> Not so much aim, but aim and move
[3:41:15] <ironwall_havoc> what is woolie playing on?
[3:41:16] <%Irridium> back in the ancient times it was a PC franchise
[3:41:17] <%JustYudha> Crossplay
[3:41:20] <+zetaplus> I wasnt gonna get this for multiplayer anyway
[3:41:22] <+Draco_Renegade> Mouse and Keyboard for Ground combat, controller for Space combat.
[3:41:22] <%Javaa01> Multiplayer is just worse Titanfall 2
[3:41:25] <Hawkbone_> No zero G
[3:41:25] <%FuqBoiSlim> I could have sworn woolie did star wars squadrons on the old channel
[3:41:28] <DatAsuna> it's just blops 3 MP with worse maps
[3:41:30] <@Menitta> The multiplayer has NONE of the cool stuff
[3:41:30] <%JustYudha> No zero g
[3:41:32] <derap41> Nope
[3:41:34] <BlackermanZX> No zero g is blasphemy
[3:41:35] <+jiggy_snipe> sounds like Titanfall without Titans lol
[3:41:36] <@Menitta> None whatsoever
[3:41:38] <Clundy> Time to revive the pc community
[3:41:38] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:41:39] <Hawkbone_> Multiplayer was just Black Ops 3. A near exact copy.
[3:41:43] <Darren716> That was Lawbreakers...
[3:41:45] <%JustYudha> There's different "heroes" though
[3:41:46] <+Kduff89> member lawbreakers
[3:41:48] <@Menitta> The multiplayer for IW is honestly really bad unfortunately
[3:41:52] <+mr_drucifer> This discussion is making me miss Shattered Horizon
[3:41:52] <DatAsuna> MP and zombies are the weakest parts of this package
[3:41:55] <@Menitta> Black Ops 3 was 2015
[3:41:56] <derap41> There is a 0G shooter can't remember its name tho
[3:41:57] <+bigslinglelino> MP is dogshit lmao
[3:41:58] <DatAsuna> No advanced was way before
[3:42:00] <NotHereToStream> advanced warfare
[3:42:00] <%EdenOfLove> Black Ops 3 before, WW2 after
[3:42:03] <Hawkbone_> Infinity Ward
[3:42:04] <%JustYudha> IW
[3:42:05] <@Menitta> AW was 2014
[3:42:06] <+lazysaiyajin> IW
[3:42:06] <+funnyfunnykid> Infinity
[3:42:07] <REGNIERx> This is infinity ward
[3:42:10] <Hawkbone_> Treyarch makes Black Ops
[3:42:13] <%Irridium> @mr_drucifer Real shit Shattered Horizon was dope as hell
[3:42:13] <DatAsuna> Infinite Warefare by Infinity Ward
[3:42:18] <dungpie64> Blobs 3 was like 2017 no ?
[3:42:18] <LycheeMusings> Sledge was Advanced
[3:42:18] <+jiggy_snipe> well it's a yearly franchise
[3:42:20] <+jiggy_snipe> with 2 devs
[3:42:25] <Darren716> The release order will show why people were so negative towards this
[3:42:26] <@Menitta> Advanced Warfare was Sledgehammer
[3:42:29] <%FuqBoiSlim> it used to be 3
[3:42:35] <%EdenOfLove> Black Ops 3 before, WW2 after, desu
[3:42:35] <rosemon5001> lots of cod said the fisherman Kappa
[3:42:36] <DatAsuna> Blops 3 is a bad campaign with 3 AWESOME levels
[3:42:36] <Hawkbone_> And then WW2 was right after
[3:42:36] <+mr_drucifer> @mr_drucifer amen
[3:42:37] <%ringabal> Boy, does it
[3:42:39] <%JustYudha> BLOPS 3 WAS SO GOOD
[3:42:42] <Rum_Ham1> blops 3 is co op
[3:42:53] <Daxalog> Blops "reverse the polarity"
[3:42:56] <black_pariah> the story of blops 3 is super crazy
[3:42:57] <Hawkbone_> Blops 3's campaign was great once you figure it out
[3:42:57] <sexdrugsvideogames> hahahahaha
[3:43:07] <+StooEsq> I keep hearing BlOps have the the really good campaigns
[3:43:13] <dungpie64> Blobs 3 WW2 level was fucking dope
[3:43:15] <Hawkbone_> Modern Warfare is technically the most recent one
[3:43:19] <Darren716> Yes
[3:43:22] <+RowenCleric> yea
[3:43:22] <+lazysaiyajin> Cod2 is great!
[3:43:25] <%Javaa01> CoD 2 was a launch title for X360
[3:43:34] <NeroInfinite> Ye
[3:43:49] <%ZweihanderSteve> my first and only call of duty was the big red one for ps2 LUL
[3:43:52] <Hawkbone_> CoD 3 was PS3 exclusive IIRC
[3:43:52] <skeletonknifefight> bo3 has amazing visuals
[3:43:58] <%ChoculaUltra> I used to prone on top of dead bodies in CoD 2 and just camp like an absolute scumbag LUL
[3:44:00] <@Menitta> the MW Remaster is really really good
[3:44:07] <fuzzy_snake> nothing will ever be better than the MW2 DC invasion, such a stunning mission
[3:44:08] <+Draco_Renegade> You also had to rebuy the DLC
[3:44:09] <%r0chelimit> I want to say that was 3?
[3:44:16] <%Shardlab> Yeah.... that's where a LOT of the hate came from
[3:44:19] <+lazysaiyajin> but do you quickscope, V?
[3:44:25] <NiktenKing> W@W was great
[3:44:26] <%Javaa01> Unfortunately they put lootboxes in the remake multiplayer
[3:44:26] <@Menitta> That and the MW Remastered had not all of the multiplayer maps and the rest were DLC
[3:44:28] <%dekkitout> Wonder if CoD will be creatively bankrupt enough to do the Spanish American War
[3:44:30] <DatAsuna> MW1 holds up the best of the 3
[3:44:33] <iosephe> Ghosts
[3:44:33] <@Menitta> Ghosts
[3:44:34] <REGNIERx> Ghosts
[3:44:34] <DatAsuna> ghosts
[3:44:34] <Hawkbone_> Ghosts
[3:44:35] <%EdenOfLove> GHOSTS

[3:44:42] <DatAsuna> everyone hates ghosts
[3:44:44] <%FuqBoiSlim> GHOSTS OMEGALUL
[3:44:45] <%Irridium> @Menitta and they added lootboxes to it

[3:44:46] <black_pariah> MOCAP DOG
[3:44:47] <NotHereToStream> ghosts is the one no one speaks of
[3:44:49] <Rum_Ham1> ghosts is the worst
[3:44:49] <DatAsuna> all my homies don't fuck with ghosts
[3:44:50] <%Shardlab> I sold a Lot of those expensive editions so people could play Modern Warfare

[3:45:04] <@Menitta> MW2 Remastered is really solid too. Just the campaign though
[3:45:05] <%ChoculaUltra> which MW had Rust? Rust separated the wheat from the chaff monkaS

[3:45:34] <NotHereToStream> AIR DASHEA
[3:45:34] <Hawkbone_> Modern Warfare 2019 is a Steel Ball Run for CoD
[3:45:35] <%ringabal> MODERN Modern Warfare
[3:45:36] <%Shardlab> *Came with my console
[3:45:39] <Bigyanno> MW2 was my multiplayer game
[3:45:42] <Explodincatz> these names are killing me
[3:45:44] <+jiggy_snipe> yea prequelboot
[3:45:46] <%dekkitout> How is "CoD: Rules of Warfare" not a title
[3:45:46] <Gc478xf> PowerUpL CorgiDerp PowerUpR
[3:45:48] <%Irridium> Modern Modern Warfare
[3:45:48] <black_pariah> youre a dude being another living the memories of another dude
[3:45:49] <Sunfrancisco> i picked up mw2 campaign and i think its still great
[3:45:52] <BlackermanZX> NotMyMW2
[3:45:54] <+lazysaiyajin> advanced warfare for sure (singleplayer)
[3:45:57] <Darren716> Woolie play Lawbreakers lol
[3:46:02] <black_pariah> or something
[3:46:03] <LycheeMusings> @Hawkbone_ LOL ur so right
[3:46:07] <%FuqBoiSlim> WHObreakers?
[3:46:09] <%Javaa01> Yeah that's what Lawbreakers was
[3:46:09] <fuzzy_snake> DC invasion radio chatter tho...
[3:46:13] <+bigslinglelino> Which one has the shooty bang stuff
[3:46:15] <EndorsedSix> is this day one of CoD??
[3:46:18] <Sunfrancisco> also mw2 is so unbalanced its fun
[3:46:19] <NeroInfinite> LAwbreakers no longer exists.
[3:46:21] <Darren716> Woolie that was Lawbreakers and you shit on it
[3:46:35] <%CommanderSqueaks> Yeah, but Lawbreakers was bad.
[3:46:36] <%ChoculaUltra> he could've been talking about Brink Kappa
[3:46:36] <%JustYudha> COD players hated this because it's too futuristic. Imagine the outrage if they had zero g
[3:46:41] <DatAsuna> Lawbreakers had good gameplay with the worst PR and most generic aesthetic
[3:46:54] <black_pariah> lawbreakers is a monument to cliffyb's hubris
[3:46:54] <DatAsuna> Bumper Jumper tactical is my life
[3:46:56] <Jashter18> Yeah Lawbreakers was fun gameplay but ass everything else
[3:46:57] <kkall49> @Ner234 ya man, enjoy!
[3:46:59] <+StooEsq> I played the LawBreakers Beta, and legitmately had fun, but while also knowing that it probably wasn't going anywhere on launch
[3:47:09] <derap41> Woolie should play Shattered Horizion because that's essentially just that
[3:47:10] <dungpie64> Blobs 3 had a character that literally has King Crimson stand
[3:47:12] <%ChoculaUltra> word, if lawbreakers just LOOKED different I probably would've played it a lot more.
[3:47:19] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Hey Woolie, heard about boundary?Its zero
[3:47:37] <%D00msDayDan> If only there was some other way to have access to all those buttons at once
[3:47:39] <@Menitta> LUL
[3:47:45] <andre11dr> I always confuse Lawbreakers with the Gear Box one,i don't even remember the name
[3:47:49] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> G R6 siege
[3:47:51] <derap41> Heart of Darkness
[3:47:56] <DatAsuna> WoolieVS the curse
[3:48:01] <%Irridium> @andre11dr BATTLEBORNE

[3:48:32] <DigitalJoshie> beta I guess

[3:48:51] <derap41> They did it on purpose
[3:48:53] <%Irridium> that's the one where you press X to do nothing about the AIDS crisis
[3:49:12] <BlackermanZX> the hidden titanfall 3
[3:49:16] <@Menitta> They were looking at Titanfall 1 at least come Black Ops 3
[3:49:18] <derap41> They did it as a fuck you because TitanFall 1 was real popular
[3:49:19] <LycheeMusings> "Hey can I look at your homework?"
[3:49:34] <andre11dr> But still didn't sell that well
[3:49:54] <andre11dr> I mean it sold good but not good enough for EA
[3:49:55] <Darren716> Didnt Woolie play that on the old channel?
[3:49:58] <%FuqBoiSlim> Who would've thought the REAL Titanfall 3 was right under our noses the entire time
[3:49:58] <DatAsuna> Did they talk about YOLO mode?
[3:50:01] <Darren716> WOOLIE YOU PLAYED IT
[3:50:03] <@Menitta> Ace Combat 7 VR is awesome
[3:50:06] <Darren716> On the old channel
[3:50:08] <%CommanderSqueaks> @DatAsuna Excuse me?

[3:51:36] <BlackermanZX> SPAAAYCE
[3:51:37] <+RowenCleric> you play as the main character of Baldurs Gate 3, people love him
[3:51:51] <%CommanderSqueaks> By default
[3:51:58] <derap41> Cod Boys didn't like it and TitanFall fans was angry because they ripped em off
[3:52:10] <DatAsuna> I remember shattered horizon
[3:52:25] <%Irridium> Shattered Horizon was amazing
[3:52:32] <NiktenKing> LUL
[3:52:36] <derap41> Its called Star Wars Squadron
[3:52:40] <DatAsuna> but just the campaign
[3:52:40] <%Theycallmenerf> Killzone Shadowfall had transforming guns ;~;
[3:52:43] <giandeli> This is the second best COD campaign
[3:52:46] <DatAsuna> Don't touch zombies lol
[3:52:46] <+Shotgundam009> fuck the homies

[3:53:20] <%Shardlab> Mimetic hate
[3:53:22] <%FuqBoiSlim> I didn't even play COD then and I still felt it lmao
[3:53:22] <Lancaster_H> also Multiplayer was objectively shit @WoolieVersus
[3:53:25] <+lazysaiyajin> can confirm
[3:53:26] <%ringabal> What homies?
[3:53:30] <%Theycallmenerf> Has Woolie seen Killzone Shadowfall guns?
[3:53:32] <%Javaa01> This game got the Marvel Infinite treatment in the CoD community a 110%
[3:53:36] <DatAsuna> Among us, IW is the shit
[3:53:41] <black_pariah> as a long time lore nerd, i love the campaign for halo 4
[3:53:44] <Darren716> I just had stopped caring about CoD like 5 years before this came out
[3:53:47] <@Solidus_113> we bigger brain
[3:53:48] <DatAsuna> Among CoD fans it's reviled as is future shit generally
[3:53:50] <Clundy> Everyone hates infinite warfare and akimbo shotguns
[3:53:50] <andre11dr> I thought that because everyone told me that, but i think they only cared about the multiplayer
[3:53:50] <KnivesEve> i was burned out and tired of the yearly thing
[3:53:52] <+ChaosEmralds> i thought i was weird that it was space so i didnt play it
[3:53:54] <derap41> Gamers as it where hated it and CoD fans hated it
[3:53:58] <%JustYudha> COD community is always divided between New vs Classic
[3:53:58] <revoltingimp> I am the smert
[3:54:04] <%D00msDayDan> When the next cod was announced to be boots on the ground only the crowd fucking cheered
[3:54:06] <%CommanderSqueaks> I was INTERESTED in the trailer, and the strong negative reaction turned me away from it.
[3:54:07] <Darren716> I mean if the multiplayer is shit no one will care
[3:54:09] <%Theycallmenerf> I played Infinite Warfare but I never played it more than a couple times. Got more hooked into Titanfall at the time.
[3:54:10] <%FuqBoiSlim> You need a certain level of intelligence to watch Woolieversus
[3:54:14] <LycheeMusings> I picked Titanfall 2 over this so...
[3:54:16] <Darren716> It doesnt matter how good the single player is
[3:54:18] <+jiggy_snipe> remember there CoD fans who want WW2
[3:54:18] <el_aythami> i just hope skullgirls get some love
[3:54:19] <El_GhostV1> wrong crowd perhaps
[3:54:37] <derap41> Multiplayer is good Story should have been finished
[3:54:40] <%DemonOfSalt> Thank you both! :)
[3:54:41] <dungpie64> Didn't Infinite Warfare trailer the mosrt disliked youtube video ?
[3:54:42] <black_pariah> story is garbage multi is good
[3:54:43] <DatAsuna> I give WW2 a pass, cause fine, you get 1 WW2 game per generation
[3:54:48] <DatAsuna> but just 1
[3:54:50] <@Menitta> There's the tiers. The Tier who always buys cod every year, the tier who says "Fuck this future shit" yet still buy it, the tier who says "wait this looks cool but I dont like cod"
[3:54:53] <ironwall_havoc> gift it
[3:54:57] <El_GhostV1> i loved it tho, this game is superfun
[3:54:59] <Lancaster_H> While the MW and Blops campaigns are great, people dont buy these games for singleplayer. @WoolieVersus
[3:55:04] <+jiggy_snipe> Woolie also isn't a CoD fan LUL
[3:55:07] <revoltingimp> kinda holding my money for cyberpunk lol
[3:55:08] <derap41> Maybe this will start a wave of Retribution
[3:55:10] <andre11dr> I haven't played Halo 5,but i have seen Halo 5 and im more confident to say that it's kinda meh
[3:55:15] <Darren716> LIES
[3:55:16] <rsg220> Woolie is the one saying Boo Infinite Urns
[3:55:16] <+JingKaisean> is the kevin spacey one good?
[3:55:18] <Explodincatz> Woolie is finally 1Guy
[3:55:22] <LycheeMusings> THE NUMBERS
[3:55:25] <%FuqBoiSlim> woolieONEGUY
[3:55:26] <+ChaosEmralds> BUT THE BLOPS
[3:55:28] <Tallie> woolie isnt a cod fan hes an infinite warfare fan
[3:55:29] <BlackermanZX> ITS ABOUT THE SPACE
[3:55:31] <DatAsuna> I'm glad me pushing this helped keep it in mind then lol
[3:55:33] <%Huntercd> Woolie has good taste
[3:55:34] <Darren716> BUT MW TRILOGY
[3:55:34] <%CommanderSqueaks> SPACE
[3:55:37] <skeletonknifefight> cod starts at infinite warfare
[3:55:38] <%cobalt_phoenix_> he wants the space and the pews
[3:55:38] <black_pariah> blops 3 is a mindbender, but thats all
[3:55:40] <%Theycallmenerf> SPACE
[3:55:44] <andre11dr> Woolie is the ONE GUY
[3:55:44] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:55:48] <%Javaa01> @JingKaisean It's alright, but all the movement stuff that game did, this game also more or less does
[3:55:48] <fuzzy_snake> reminds me of the 2003 Genndy Tartakovsky clone wars
[3:55:51] <%FuqBoiSlim> woolieSPICE woolieONEGUY woolieSPICE woolieONEGUY woolieSPICE woolieONEGUY woolieSPICE woolieONEGUY
[3:55:54] <%Theycallmenerf> ONE WOOLIE
[3:55:58] <andre11dr> But he won't
[3:55:59] <dungpie64> Call of duty infinite Warfare trailer has like 3,9mil dislikes
[3:56:02] <giandeli> This game had possibly to worst CoD multiplayer but an amazing campaign and the best non Treyarch zombies mode.
[3:56:05] <%Shardlab> If you can find it at Gamestop or somewhere, it's $5
[3:56:06] <DatAsuna> time to go catch the first half on VOD
[3:56:10] <+JingKaisean> @JingKaisean Nice, I'll have to grab this
