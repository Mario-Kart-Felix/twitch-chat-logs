[1:54:22] <hassanico2> YEAH QUADRUPLE BARRIER
[1:54:23] <crimsonsaens> Sakuya is the dio girl
[1:54:23] <tearfuldevil> my touhou knowledge is very very limited
[1:54:25] <Polarix64> Also the witch girl is the character that Jessica's super came from in the Umineko fighting game
[1:54:27] <%DatAsuna> dio girlis sakuya
[1:54:28] <Darthkitten_Prime> Please tell me she has her train in this game
[1:54:29] <Mokoulishious> man reggie seems really bad at fighting games
[1:54:31] <0pirus> so this is what the underside of the barrel looks like
[1:54:32] <%DatAsuna> sakuya is maid
[1:54:33] <SpeedFetishist> no gap shenanigans in her moveset
[1:54:35] <SpeedFetishist> ?
[1:54:40] <%Solidnick18> ooooh

[1:54:44] <hassanico2> THE COMEBACK?!
[1:54:45] <hamahiroyuki> might be the same person? i actually doubt theres more than 3 LUL
[1:54:45] <hassanico2> Nope
[1:54:45] <+RealThiele> brooooom
[1:54:47] <%ozmon> I'm pretty sure Sakuya (silver-haired maido) is DIO
[1:54:49] <+jiggy_snipe> PogChamp
[1:54:49] <Thunderhog> we dont budget for master spark
[1:54:51] <%MonsieurHonHon> broom crossup

[1:55:03] <tearfuldevil> yeah, Sakuya, that was it
[1:55:05] <%Irridium> you assume this had a budget
[1:55:06] <hassanico2> Reggie needs to try more super combinations, WOolie figured out 3 LUL
[1:55:06] <Taarin> Sakuya was literally based off of Dio
[1:55:10] <%ozmon> I love how Yukari is lit completely differently
[1:55:12] <%DatAsuna> Yukari is bucciarati
[1:55:17] <+RaveBV> clutch
[1:55:18] <T_Sasquatch> Honestly i think a game using real life sprites could be pretty good if given enough money
[1:55:20] <%Solidnick18> ohhhh

[1:55:25] <CrazyMedicine> there it is
[1:55:25] <tearfuldevil> i only know a few touhou characetrs anmes and they all mix in my head cause i can't match a design with a name
[1:55:26] <TeepPhoenix> Sakuya has literally attacks named after references to Dio
[1:55:27] <+RealThiele> that mspaint-ass teleportal
[1:55:37] <TeepPhoenix> I think one is even called "XXI- The WORLD"
[1:55:48] <hassanico2> It's just Sakuya's World
[1:55:56] <%Wool> Sakuya gets a lot of Dio moves in Soku, like knife counter

[1:56:34] <TeepPhoenix> I wonder if this game has a story mode like Dong Dong
[1:56:36] <crimsonsaens> Of course Woolie plays the boss character
[1:56:36] <hassanico2> @MyNameIsRasus nope
[1:56:43] <+jetjagger222> the lighting on yukari makes the sprites look extra creepy

[1:57:03] <+Debauchery_Man> does she have her train super?
[1:57:08] <BrazillianCara> The thing about Touhou is that they're ALL boss characters. Even the protagonists.
[1:57:16] <townzzzzz> LUL
[1:57:20] <%Wool> some are midboss characters

[1:58:22] <Potatoidea> She's got the shmup moves
[1:58:26] <%PettyFunk> Whew, I saw Touhou and I was alarmed. Seeing that it's this is reassuring that Woolie hasn't fallen down an entirely new hole

[1:58:37] <+Debauchery_Man> mima will never come back
[1:58:37] <tearfuldevil> yeah one of the things i actually know about touhou is the music slaps

[1:58:45] <+RealThiele> those cards deal like no damage
[1:58:46] <Vashido22> @lem______ thanks
[1:58:47] <%pectusumbra> Man this just reminds me of fighting Reimu is Luna Nights and holy shit that fight is rough
[1:58:50] <townzzzzz> wish they went with the joke that reimu would play like sol
[1:58:52] <lem______> reimu has too many projectiles
[1:58:53] <TeepPhoenix> Has Yuugi even been in a canon 2hu fighting game?
[1:58:53] <Potatoidea> The music is entirely why I know about Touhou
[1:58:58] <hassanico2> nope
[1:58:59] <Taarin> You KNOW they gave the MC some sauce
[1:59:01] <%BisoromiBear> next game for sure, mimabros

[1:59:17] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> the lighting on the sprites is even different LUL amazing
[1:59:19] <%Wool> Yuugi is big strong punch girl
[1:59:25] <%ozmon> Now Reggie's truly just playing Touhou
[1:59:27] <lem______> but the grabs are weird
[1:59:27] <%Solidnick18> is it a grappler
[1:59:30] <%pectusumbra> Was she the one with the inversion power?
[1:59:34] <lem______> its a burst that you can combo from
[1:59:36] <lem______> and into
[1:59:40] <TeepPhoenix> I think that was Seiga
[1:59:41] <%PettyFunk> @Solidnick18 p sure she's an oni
[1:59:44] <Taarin> LUL
[1:59:45] <%Wool> Reimu's power is that she can float
[1:59:47] <Potatoidea> Inversion is someone else, might not be in this game
[1:59:50] <%pectusumbra> I think she has her own touhou fan game, Gensokyo Night Festival?
[1:59:51] <hassanico2> Yuugi has power over supernatural phenomena
[1:59:54] <Udongein_1> seija is the inverse girl
[1:59:55] <%ozmon> lol what
[1:59:58] <hassanico2> Seija is the inversion character and she's not in this

[2:01:43] <shaddydaddyo> i came here expecting touhou... i got touhou alright
[2:01:46] <%PettyFunk> I like that Not!Sakura's name is literally just MAHOU SHOUJO
[2:01:50] <+Debauchery_Man> remilia was always a low tier character
[2:01:52] <+jetjagger222> this is touhou at home
[2:02:00] <Taarin> Character development time spent in the oven ranges from well done to still bloody
[2:02:00] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:02:02] <%Wool> this is why Yuugi hasn't been in a game ever since
[2:02:03] <TeepPhoenix> GIVE HER A BREAK SHE'S DRUNK
[2:02:04] <+RealThiele> alcohol does not improve performance
[2:02:05] <%SilverRoddo> That’s a donator in the background?
[2:02:05] <+paladinstarbuster> does this game havea command list?
[2:02:18] <%Wool> @SilverRoddo that's Mima
[2:02:23] <@Solidus_113> Higurashi is a VN
[2:02:25] <Potatoidea> Friend of Umineko
[2:02:30] <digitalslime> prequel to umineko
[2:02:30] <hamahiroyuki> the actual original creator of the touhou series? LUL
[2:02:30] <+paladinstarbuster> Diferent anime thing
[2:02:35] <@akuda_bar> novel that came out before umineko, basically.
[2:02:36] <tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus it by the umineko righter
[2:02:42] <%pectusumbra> Higurashi is When the Higurashi Cry. It's the thing that came BEFORE Umineko
[2:02:44] <tearfuldevil> writer
[2:02:46] <majindusto> Is this even Touhou?
[2:02:47] <devanmuse> higurashi - when they cry. you probably heard of it a good decade ago. horror anime
[2:02:49] <%SilverRoddo> Ah, thanks.
[2:02:50] <%PukingGoombas> A-are these men in tohou outfits
[2:02:51] <lem______> @Debauchery_Man Remilla is not low tier in soku, at al
[2:02:51] <0pirus> this is the true touhou
[2:02:52] <@Solidus_113> pretty decent anime too, at least the first 2 seasons
[2:02:52] <MyNameIsRasus> this is that anime underbelly
[2:02:56] <Potatoidea> This is very much Touhou
[2:02:59] <%ozmon> Higurashi no Naku Koro ni?
[2:03:01] <@Solidus_113> yes
[2:03:02] <%Axle13j> (great VN btw. super cheap on steam)

[2:03:15] <+bigdrifter> what in the cursed fuck is this
[2:03:20] <Potatoidea> All I know about Higurashi is that it's messed up and something about fingernails
[2:03:20] <townzzzzz> yooooooooooooooo
[2:03:21] <hassanico2> YES
[2:03:21] <%YakumoYomi> You hear that, chat? Woolie thinks he knows what Touhou is. That's cute.
[2:03:22] <%Irridium> so then hpps is from higurashi?
[2:03:23] <Emily_Luxnoire> Remilia died

[2:03:26] <@Solidus_113> woolieSHOOK woolieSHOOK
[2:03:26] <@akuda_bar> higurashi = horror VN about school kids. umineko = horror vn about fancy rich people.

[2:03:27] <%Axle13j> LOLLLL
[2:03:27] <MyNameIsRasus> that was.... sick?
[2:03:34] <%SilverRoddo> A into, B has cool-down
[2:03:35] <+Debauchery_Man> this is touhou, completely canon
[2:03:39] <%PettyFunk> I've always been distantly curious about Higurashi and Umineko. The latter has some bomb ass music though
[2:03:40] <+Atomic_ColliderSG> oh shit I'm taking some notes right now
[2:03:43] <%ozmon> Yeah, it's a super psychological horror business
[2:03:44] <spardanwarrior> Higurashi: When They Cry is a very nice visual novel where nothing bad ever happens.
[2:03:51] <%Axle13j> ^
[2:03:54] <+Debauchery_Man> really ZUN just stole the music and characters from this masterpiece
[2:03:55] <%Livelinne> this is sure a passion project clempsComfy
[2:03:55] <TeepPhoenix> Don't you like to the poeople like that
[2:03:58] <devanmuse> @akuda_bar Ciconia - horror vn about child soldiers

[2:15:09] <MyNameIsRasus> woolieONEGUY
[2:15:10] <Polarix64> But yeah Woolie needs to be introduced to how good Touhou music is, Zun is amazing when it comes to music and he makes some pretty good shmups too.

[2:15:24] <hassanico2> aw this thing might not be parsec friendly
[2:15:26] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> I assume it's a joy2key issue
[2:15:30] <BrazillianCara> @thegreenbenis Kinda.
[2:15:31] <%Irridium> parsec and joy2key might just not work together
[2:15:42] <%Irridium> or maybe the game is just garbage and refuses
[2:15:43] <tearfuldevil> i don't think joy2key works with parsec
[2:15:47] <+jiggy_snipe> oh ok
[2:15:48] <tearfuldevil> huh
[2:15:56] <MyNameIsRasus> LESS GO
[2:15:59] <+Debauchery_Man> i mean the game is garbage but its garbage with heart

[2:16:40] <SpookyBeef7> Worked straight away with HnK so maybe just this game then.

[2:18:39] <%ozmon> I thought they were gonna play Hopeless Masquerade, which is a banger of an attempt at a Touhou Fighting game, with beautiful pixel art and music
[2:18:41] <Karhax> that's a 5
[2:18:42] <Potatoidea> Reggie in Mugen
[2:18:42] <%terraspan> This is not the Touhou I expected
[2:18:49] <%ozmon> Touhou 13.5 Hopeless Masquerade check it out yall

[2:19:40] <tearfuldevil> woolies never gonna play actual 2hu lol
[2:19:41] <Man_in_the_Red> they will never play the real TouHou fighters because of some guy on twitter i think
[2:19:47] <+RealThiele> that knife
[2:19:50] <tearfuldevil> the fighters, maybe
[2:19:52] <%Wool> they played Soku for FNF
[2:19:56] <Polarix64> Isn't there an actually legit Touhou fighting that isn't just funny jank meme game like this?
