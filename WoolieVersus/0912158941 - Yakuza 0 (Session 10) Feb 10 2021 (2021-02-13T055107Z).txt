[0:09:53] <%cobalt_phoenix_> why 76?
[0:10:03] <DatAsuna> fly high like a butterfly
[0:10:04] <Visorak6> Option 2 is pat
[0:10:04] <%AlteisenReiseZ> YEAH
[0:10:13] <@akuda_bar> you have to announce to everyone that you need to Shit
[0:10:15] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> This is my pee spot in Antarctica. I go here every time.
[0:10:18] <%X2Eliah> 76 is like 50 nowadays
[0:10:19] <%Livelinne> clearl19BigBrain
[0:10:19] <daniphofani> 76 is pretty decent time to pass
[0:10:19] <%FeelinNifty> Oh, that's a good point. I was honestly leaning towards 2 but, yeah, sometimes I gotta LEAVE
[0:10:22] <+QueequegTheater> But I could go longer
[0:10:22] <NotHereToStream> 76 is good, i'd get tired of living by then
[0:10:27] <+Superbro64> Why do you people always make shit option a vs option b questions
[0:10:30] <+Stupid121v2> fly to your own shit spot on a mountain!!!
[0:10:32] <+jiggy_snipe> no window either
[0:10:34] <+runegod20> i don't expect to make it to 76, and 76 still seems good
[0:10:34] <+Superbro64> Make better questions mates
[0:10:35] <OokamiDen02> I mean.... You could die before that
[0:10:37] <+ASovietSharkPro> I'd rather be SuperMan that Pees
[0:10:37] <DatAsuna> Knowing how old I'm gonna die is too scary
[0:10:37] <GarbageNirvana> My grandma is 80 and she seems to be tired of life
[0:10:38] <+Grim1952> You canwon't be sitting in the toilet thinking about death at least
[0:10:43] <Equirah> at leas then you'd know you're not gonna day within a year LUL
[0:10:45] <servicesuspension> I lose connection for a few minutes and now piss talk
[0:10:47] <%Puhff> And dying on your bday is ruff
[0:10:49] <shieldecho> After the past couple of weeks of personal issues I'd choose option 2 in a heartbeat
[0:10:50] <MuffinMastr> @NotHereToStream you aint tired of living already??
[0:10:54] <Chaos_Switch> im 30 and im tired of living lmao
[0:10:54] <%CalderGaming> @WoolieVersus consider also: no one wants to see your 90-year-old ass pissing through the sky
[0:10:55] <%Chatterbox1991> @woolieversus you see that shit about the 117 year old French Nun that survived covid
[0:10:57] <Mr_Zero5232> I mean If using the bathroom is the only thing keeping you from being productive there‚Äôs more going on there
[0:10:57] <+jiggy_snipe> do you shit yourself in your sleep?
[0:10:59] <$Nested_Dreams> I thought getting old would be okay, but seeing my grandma suffer at 91 yo hurts, she can't remember anything
[0:11:01] <jorniev> INMORTALITY ALWAYS
[0:11:02] <@akuda_bar> i would hate to shit at superspeed, that doesnt sound comfortable
[0:11:03] <skewerstar> Wait... what if you were immortal until you hit 76?
[0:11:04] <MelBrooksKA> diapers are a thing too
[0:11:05] <+Deko_> Kreygasm
[0:11:07] <NotHereToStream> @Muffinmastr slowly getting there
[0:11:07] <+Stupid121v2> oh no sleep shitting
[0:11:08] <+nevermorecake> LUL
[0:11:12] <JayEarly> If I go shit ass will you still call me Superman?
[0:11:14] <exnuart> super man has a 100% effecient digestive system, he doesn't even need to use the bathroom
[0:11:16] <servicesuspension> Bidets are a myth!
[0:11:17] <$Nested_Dreams> I'd take option 2 just not to get old
[0:11:17] <DatAsuna> your last year would be terrifying
[0:11:19] <+QueequegTheater> My grandparents are in their mid 80s and they're still active. I wouldn't give up at 76
[0:11:20] <+Grim1952> But going to the toilet 48 times a day?
[0:11:22] <+jiggy_snipe> they said every 30 mins so legitimate question
[0:11:24] <chainsaw105> but what if every year up to 76 is spent with immortality
[0:11:25] <R0kushi> bathroom time amazing to read
[0:11:25] <linSP> Woolie says: ‚Äúshitting is AWESOME‚Äù
[0:11:28] <%X2Eliah> Ah, you don't mean the "squat hole in the ground" Japanese bathroom?
[0:11:29] <RealDurdyDan> @nested_dreams Same
[0:11:31] <Blank9> I'd give up stomach aches for sure
[0:11:33] <%kewlmyc> On the opposite spectrum, the Japanese bathrooms that are just a hole in the ground
[0:11:42] <iswearimjustdandy> I would do almost anything to not have to piss
[0:11:42] <+runegod20> no, 30 minutes when you awake
[0:11:44] <+Stupid121v2> Pat

[0:11:50] <+QueequegTheater> Or does it mean that in 30 minutes, you're going whether you like it or not
[0:11:53] <%caramelatte1> NON public bathrooms are great
[0:11:53] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Yeah PAT
[0:11:56] <brachydios777> While you are awake
[0:11:57] <+b_aleph> V, have you gotten your Jordans yet?
[0:11:57] <DatAsuna> you got a bidet built into your toilet or you got a bidet?
[0:11:58] <%FeelinNifty> [everyone turns to stare at Pat]
[0:12:01] <+ASovietSharkPro> The Japanese spectrum is so wide in terms of bathroom
[0:12:02] <servicesuspension> If someone offered me a way to never ever have to go to the bathroom again, I'd take it
[0:12:04] <masterfire23> read titter in the bathroom
[0:12:11] <%jinking79> save me hours at work
[0:12:11] <%Javaa01> @runegod20 Okay but what about sleep paralysis?
[0:12:15] <R0kushi> poop time is where I read
[0:12:15] <Mr_Zero5232> Turns out if you just clean the bathroom it‚Äôs not gross
[0:12:15] <@akuda_bar> poop time is nice and quiet
[0:12:17] <$thomassolorio> not to get political but what's your guys though on empeachment 2 electric boogaloo
[0:12:17] <RAH001> Pat call out
[0:12:18] <OokamiDen02> this is the weirdest conversation
[0:12:20] <+Stupid121v2> fuck sleep
[0:12:22] <NotHereToStream> no sleep is good
[0:12:22] <servicesuspension> I mean, I would still go, but only to escape from awkwardness
[0:12:22] <+Stupid121v2> i love it
[0:12:22] <%Livelinne> psaWhat
[0:12:24] <Pnutz409> Making yellow snow is my favorite pasttime.
[0:12:25] <daniphofani> this is the anti-batching stream m6kwMoisty
[0:12:27] <%BallerSwagBro9k> WELCOME TO WOOLIEVS EVERYONE LUL
[0:12:28] <brachydios777> I like a nice throne
[0:12:30] <%X2Eliah> Do you want to live with like 50 years' worth of digested food stuck up your insides?
[0:12:31] <+ASovietSharkPro> Poop time takes up so little of your fucking day tho
[0:12:33] <DatAsuna> gotta sleep with a catheter
[0:12:34] <chainsaw105> hot take: the toilet seat being warm after the last person is done is SUBLIME
[0:12:34] <+Grim1952> Fast charge sleep
[0:12:36] <Blank9> fuck sleep
[0:12:39] <exnuart> just sleep 4 hours a night like me
[0:12:44] <akman14> Is anyone else having problems donating through streamlabs?
[0:12:45] <JetpackMcQuack> All those drugs are illegal
[0:12:47] <servicesuspension> I like dreaming :(
[0:12:48] <+Superbro64> ?? Whoever wrote this question may have a toilet phobia
[0:12:48] <Mr_Zero5232> Also if you don‚Äôt eat like shit it takes less time to use the bathroom
[0:12:48] <%ZweihanderSteve> lightning sleep
[0:12:50] <%X2Eliah> Also if you don't poop at all you basically MUST vomit just to make room
[0:12:50] <velgaduere> that's elven sleep in DND
[0:12:50] <goodguybadman> If you take poop out of your life that‚Äôs like half of all the good things.
[0:12:52] <andre11dr> Just do meth that will do it
[0:12:53] <DatAsuna> poop time isn't enough of my life
[0:12:55] <Chaos_Switch> not having to eat
[0:12:57] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Reading books count as sleep, 1:1
[0:12:57] <$thomassolorio> interesting
[0:12:58] <%Chatterbox1991> Fast Charge Sleep or Odin Sleep
[0:12:58] <%Livelinne> woolieMINHMAX ResidentSleeper
[0:13:02] <alvaroeltz> REM on a click? oh yeah, id take that
[0:13:04] <jesuchanplays> one day we'll have tesla superchargers but for people
[0:13:07] <SereneFox> Sleeping is amazing though, it's my favorite #1 hobby
[0:13:09] <+jiggy_snipe> woah
[0:13:12] <DatAsuna> polyphasic but without the crazy person hours
[0:13:14] <+Stupid121v2> 4 hours later still awake
[0:13:15] <Chaos_Switch> I like the taste of food and all, but im so tired of wasting hours of my life standing there chewing
[0:13:26] <%Chatterbox1991> Odin Sleep is the best thing ever
[0:13:31] <Parapattern> It takes me at least two hours to fall asleep
[0:13:35] <DatAsuna> 2 hours is possible but you have to do it in 15 minute chunks throughout the day
[0:13:36] <%gatorafan> ResidentSleeper
[0:13:42] <servicesuspension> I would like to sleep for weeks at a time
[0:13:50] <%FeelinNifty> I wanted to make a batching joke but I was worried no one here would get it. Thank you @daniphofani m6kwMoisty
[0:13:52] <%jinking79> really need a Tonio's restaurant for that
[0:13:53] <DatAsuna> Polyphasic sleep is for insane people
[0:14:00] <DatAsuna> but it does seem very productive
[0:14:01] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1359058937946009600?s=19
[0:14:06] <servicesuspension> The problem with that microsleep shit is that you gotta train it like you were a fuckin' monk
[0:14:30] <daniphofani> @FeelinNifty Jabroni_mike solidarity m6kwSass
[0:14:34] <%LastHazzerd> oh that's dangerous
[0:14:35] <+QueequegTheater> Oof
[0:14:39] <goodguybadman> Just a Narc
[0:15:02] <%X2Eliah> AHAHAHAHAA it's patentet?
[0:15:06] <%X2Eliah> patented*
[0:15:07] <+Grim1952> God dammit namco
[0:15:09] <+Stupid121v2> THATS ROUGH
[0:15:10] <+Tucker0603> @woolieversus I have something similar, moving vehicles make me sleepy, nearly died driving before
[0:15:15] <+OmegaWeltall> ah no wonder fighting game tutorials are garbage
[0:15:18] <%Asuterisuku> That was decades ago for Ridge Racer.
[0:15:20] <Chaos_Switch> lol what
[0:15:20] <iswearimjustdandy> The patent ran out a few years ago
[0:15:21] <%gatorafan> woolieDATTEBAYO
[0:15:21] <JayEarly> they patented loading screen minigames AND THEY DON'T USE THEM
[0:15:21] <+jiggy_snipe> hmmmm how many lame patents are holding back the industry
[0:15:22] <%Asuterisuku> And they did NOTHING with it.
[0:15:23] <%Chatterbox1991> CRAZY TAXI
[0:15:26] <linSP> patent EVERY MECHANIC
[0:15:28] <%Livelinne> hnyBooBoo
[0:15:28] <servicesuspension> I just checked screenshots of Mass Effect Legendary. Why do people think lens flares look good?
[0:15:33] <Mr_Rakjo> that patent died on 2017 but noone has started doing minigames on loadins screens yet @WoolieVersus
[0:15:38] <%X2Eliah> Lens flares look distinctive
[0:15:43] <$Nested_Dreams> Patents for QoL are the most hurty if they are not open patents
[0:15:43] <therealtacopancakes> here in mexico we might get the third one, the russain one...
[0:15:52] <primaryfire> didn't the guy who invented the synthesis method for insulin sell the patent for $1 so that it would be widely available?
[0:15:55] <Emotional_Sledgehammer> insulin gang rise up
[0:15:56] <goodguybadman> I want a vaccine from taco bell
[0:16:08] <DatAsuna> patents make sense when you actually use it but they're far too troll-able
[0:16:08] <brachydios777> I feel the ultimate goal is to be like an Exo in Destiny where you don‚Äôt need to sleep or go to the bathroom but you can still do human things like eat, feel, and get horny
[0:16:12] <%Asuterisuku> Don't ASW games use sounds?
[0:16:21] <+b_aleph> Woolie, that sleepy guy you mentioned has absence seizures
[0:16:22] <iswearimjustdandy> There should be a patent to anti-patent things immediately, so that no one can
[0:16:26] <servicesuspension> Patents have done nothing for innovation for the last like 80 years
[0:16:29] <%LastHazzerd> uuuugh, it shouldn't be legal
[0:16:53] <%Asuterisuku> Hey, remember that one dude who patented the word "Edge?"
[0:16:57] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> woolieYE
[0:16:59] <iswearimjustdandy> @primaryfire yeah and then an asshole pataented it and now its crazy expensive
[0:17:06] <servicesuspension> That dude who patented the word Edge is now a priest
[0:17:06] <%Asuterisuku> I think Namco did the minigame thing because they were salty about that.
[0:17:08] <DatAsuna> good new name
[0:17:17] <%X2Eliah> man, imagine if everyone on social media (twitch, twitter, youtube etc.) changed to using their real names
[0:17:19] <linSP> Wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúreact‚Äù patented

[0:28:42] <%aram909> he was a racist and a dirty misogynist
[0:28:47] <MuffinMastr> Ill definately go check that out: Penn and tellers bullshit?
[0:28:47] <jorniev> Sometimes the idea of what they stood for is more important than the historical person themselves.
[0:28:48] <servicesuspension> Gandhi did fuck all those children
[0:28:48] <+Radkon> It was the Dalai Lama by the looks of it
[0:28:49] <Karego_at> yea they're fucking awful, che guevara too
[0:28:50] <%aram909> gandhi thought that black people were animals
[0:28:53] <%kewlmyc> Ghandi was racist and kinda pedo with his niece
[0:28:54] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus The Dalaia Lama
[0:28:54] <%aram909> and deserved to be at the back of the train
[0:28:54] <+QueequegTheater> Ghandi was a racist ephebophile
[0:28:55] <thatbandltguy> Kill your heroes
[0:28:56] <%Afterman_> didnt ghandi like sleeping next to other naked women/children? or am i misremembering
[0:28:56] <digitalslime> dalli lama
[0:28:58] <linSP> WORLD IS A FUCK
[0:29:06] <andre11dr> I mean to be fair, the world was just kind evil back then
[0:29:07] <jorniev> uuuugh
[0:29:07] <%LastHazzerd> every revolution for the people was started by the 2nd in command who wanted to be the new ruling class
[0:29:10] <%X2Eliah> It's not for nothing that Ghandi is known to choose the nuclear option asap
[0:29:11] <%aram909> @Afterman_ he forced his niece to sleep next to him while he was naked
[0:29:13] <%ChoculaUltra> wait till you read about Ghandi's experiments on sexuality LUL
[0:29:14] <$thomassolorio> mother teresa was MASGUS
[0:29:14] <+Stupid121v2> GOD fuck that
[0:29:22] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Also he hated Africans
[0:29:23] <DatAsuna> Tibet was big into the caste system and torturing their slaves
[0:29:23] <%aram909> so he could prove that he could resist temptations
[0:29:23] <%Livelinne> MonkaS
[0:29:25] <@Menitta> At least we got Nobunaga Kappa
[0:29:27] <%Chatterbox1991> Lord Mountbatten

[0:29:28] <%ChoculaUltra> there we go monkaS
[0:29:28] <+Stupid121v2> Ghandi was doing some EXPERIMENTS
[0:29:29] <andre11dr> Evil was the default state of the world back then
[0:29:29] <iswearimjustdandy> @afterman_ yea he did that to show his ‚Äúpurity‚Äù
[0:29:33] <%BallerSwagBro9k> OOF
[0:29:34] <brunoberserk> you telling me madre teresa is a blasphemous boss ?
[0:29:34] <%BinaryFireball> Mother Theresa unlocked that weird as rubix cube
[0:29:40] <digitalslime> @Afterman_ ya ganddi slept naked as a "test of chasity"
[0:29:41] <+toomuchsnarfsnarf> Suffer like G did
[0:29:41] <+Stupid121v2> Ghandi was just PEEPIN THINGS OUT
[0:29:42] <LVL1_Scumbag> The special shooreh pippi
[0:29:42] <%jinking79> no one prays for Lucifer who suffers the most
[0:29:44] <catalyst40> Wasn't Theresa this big-time madame?
[0:29:45] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Ghandi was also a big racist
[0:29:51] <OldManDeckardCain> "I'm just testing my resolve, by lying next to my niece all night" Kappa
[0:29:52] <+Joe2187> Mother Theresa was a Cenobite?
[0:29:53] <DatAsuna> Majima would not approve of ghandi
[0:29:54] <digitalslime> *with kids in his bed
[0:30:01] <$thomassolorio> mother teresa was a berserk character
[0:30:02] <%BisoromiBear> he was trading in compo
[0:30:03] <servicesuspension> Every cartoon network revival gets us closer and closer to the endgame: Big O Season 3
[0:30:05] <%Afterman_> @Joe2187 yea basiclly
[0:30:08] <%aram909> as an indian its really hard to talk to my indian family and friends about gandhi
[0:30:11] <iswearimjustdandy> @joe2187 assdghdjfk
[0:30:13] <%aram909> they refuse to hear the truth
[0:30:15] <%X2Eliah> NONE OF OUR FOOD IS NATURAL
[0:30:18] <AnneSQF> what show are we taking about?
[0:30:25] <servicesuspension> Like 99% of potatoes are straight up poison
[0:30:26] <%Afterman_> veggies are tehnically GMOs by simply breeding them in general
[0:30:27] <DatAsuna> Bananas are the hardest counter to the GMO fear
[0:30:32] <digitalslime> penn & tellers bullshit
[0:30:35] <goodguybadman> That‚Äôs GMO shit is all bull shit
[0:30:35] <Karego_at> all food is gmo.... like no plant looks like that naturally
[0:30:35] <DatAsuna> Tomatoes are GMOs
[0:30:39] <%wibbwobbler> bananas are neat
[0:30:40] <AhmCha> If you eat corn, you're eating the longest living GMO in existence
[0:30:41] <AnneSQF> @digitalslime cheers
[0:30:41] <%aram909> all the food we eat is genetically modified
[0:30:41] <+runegod20> don't hate the game hate the player
[0:30:46] <$thomassolorio> they also said smoking wasn't bad but regretted it
[0:30:48] <%LastHazzerd> it's the only damn reason we can "support" this population.

[0:30:56] <%aram909> to increase the prices of food
[0:31:05] <servicesuspension> Penn and Teller also fucked up, but they had some good takes
[0:31:07] <+Ether101_Prime> All crop and cattle based food is genetically modified.
[0:31:09] <Karego_at> gmo is good, copyrighting gmo's and shitting on farmers is not
[0:31:25] <+Joe2187> GMOs have been a thing since fucking machu piccu
[0:31:25] <%Asuterisuku> Better not eat bananas.
[0:31:26] <%Afterman_> fuckin cross-pollination is GMO
[0:31:29] <AhmCha> Never forget than Greenpeace lobbied to prevent "golden rice" which could have massively prevented blindness in Africa from being distributed
[0:31:31] <atgithursdays> shoutout to Norman, native Iowan and one of two Iowa statues in the us capitol
[0:31:32] <MuffinMastr> that sounds like the opposite of what we associate with GMO that sounds like sharecropping which is illegal now.
[0:31:35] <LVL1_Scumbag> That's literally why corn is a thing

[0:31:46] <+runegod20> and haven't anti GMO food people denied tons of food to starving people in third world countries because they were GMO?
[0:31:46] <servicesuspension> The term Genetically Modified was concocted to evoke Resident Evil-esque imagery

[0:37:01] <servicesuspension> That is not Pocket Circuit
[0:37:02] <+Stupid121v2> Yakuza 3 is stellar but aged
[0:37:03] <heckengine> how many yakuzas are there
[0:37:04] <%X2Eliah> is the game audio low? I cannot tell if the game just isn't sounding much
[0:37:07] <SereneFox> so he's on yakuza 4?
[0:37:12] <leith_aziz> Too bad
[0:37:12] <rockethed1> @iswearimjustdandy Italian timezone is a pain
[0:37:13] <exnuart> take a small break between them v
[0:37:15] <digitalslime> ya
[0:37:17] <OokamiDen02> love Y4
[0:37:17] <astrophizz> I just started 4 also. loving kick man
[0:37:21] <servicesuspension> The same town every time
[0:37:22] <Wofoeh> Chat, did woolie do the dominatrix sidequest?
[0:37:24] <+Stupid121v2> 4 is really great.
[0:37:26] <iswearimjustdandy> @runegod20 soba is god like if you like chewiness in noodles
[0:37:28] <+runegod20> 3's big problem is mostly just beginning pacing and a bit of the combat
[0:37:31] <%notsoy> @Wofoeh no, he did not
[0:37:37] <andre11dr> 4 is really great
[0:37:38] <+Stupid121v2> HELL YEAH V good opinions
[0:37:38] <jotabranded> oh that's cool
[0:37:39] <+nevermorecake> Woah
[0:37:39] <%Asuterisuku> There are a couple different towns.
[0:37:42] <%patriotrenegade> ur wrong tho
[0:37:43] <%Chatterbox1991> But Kiwami 2 tho
[0:37:43] <%dukenux> Yeah, prolly better squeeze in a different game between those
[0:37:43] <AnneSQF> in real life, everyone has their own little side quest
[0:37:44] <%Halospaz117> I respect that
[0:37:44] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus As someone who marathonned all 8 mainine games in 3 months, FUCK MARATHONNING
[0:37:46] <@Menitta> Really? Thats a unique opinion
[0:37:47] <%aram909> 3 is very good but i personally prefer 4 out of 3-5
[0:37:48] <+runegod20> i don't know how much I actually do care about my noodles being chewie, still sound interesting
[0:37:49] <ghoststalker> Kick mans!
[0:37:50] <leith_aziz> Shen feels the same, funnily enough
[0:37:52] <DatAsuna> 3's big problem is the generation switch, a much bigger focus was on replacing the tech
[0:37:53] <@Menitta> Not wrong but unique
[0:37:57] <digitalslime> just finished 3 and i'm only 20% completed for the completion log.
[0:37:58] <strudel_h> I wanna play the yakuza games but I hope there's not any I should skip
[0:37:59] <PsychoPearl> I like 3
[0:37:59] <primaryfire> I love that 3 recognises kiryu for his humanity rather than him being a punching machine for the first time
[0:37:59] <OokamiDen02> 4 is my favorite after 0
[0:38:02] <Solidnick18> 4 is pretty good
[0:38:02] <Wofoeh> @notsoy just saw the guys of the producer sidequest which is required to start that one
[0:38:03] <leith_aziz> But she liked the orphanage stuff alot
[0:38:03] <+MrBaldachin> I recently finished 3 and I really dislike its story, but other than that and some combat gripes it's great
[0:38:04] <@Menitta> 3 is still a good game
[0:38:05] <%X2Eliah> oh ... (
[0:38:07] <%Asuterisuku> 3 is a filler episode.
[0:38:09] <morow1ec> Combat in 3 sucks
[0:38:11] <%r0chelimit> 4 is a good game but FUCK does that story turn shit
[0:38:12] <jotabranded> 4 is a amazing, 5 is even better
[0:38:14] <ghoststalker> 3‚Äôs twist was dumb
[0:38:14] <astrophizz> it's just to build bonds with characters
[0:38:16] <%dukenux> The Empty Lot area
[0:38:16] <+runegod20> you can kind of understanding the pacing of the beginning of 3 but it's still kind of slow
[0:38:19] <servicesuspension> Localize the samurai game :(
[0:38:24] <ghoststalker> 4‚Äôs twist was dumber
[0:38:25] <%notsoy> @Wofoeh no, the dominatrix sidequest is not connected to anything else
[0:38:26] <DatAsuna> That whole opening is purely to get you emotionally invested, and it doesn't do that as well as it could
[0:38:28] <%patriotrenegade> I am gathering my nails.
[0:38:34] <ghoststalker> Also, way too many blocking enemies
[0:38:34] <PKSomething> 3's story with the place kiryu is now is baller, shush
[0:38:38] <leith_aziz> "4/5 memories"
[0:38:39] <Wofoeh> @woolieversus 3 is quite literally the beach episode
[0:38:41] <fIashman92> But the Mark II though!
[0:38:42] <%kewlmyc> Yakuza has dumb fucking plot twists, you're not wrong
[0:38:47] <+Grim1952> 6 had the most dissapointing ending for me
[0:38:48] <DatAsuna> Boy are 4 and 5 not gonna buck that trend
[0:38:49] <glaciusinfinite> where we chat?
[0:38:49] <%notsoy> WEAPON SHOP IS NEARBY
[0:38:51] <+bPlusPlus> you get a business buddy from the Dominatrix thing
[0:38:53] <+Stupid121v2> Absolutely
[0:38:57] <+runegod20> 3 just has a bigger cast and they give each cast a big of an arc
[0:39:00] <glaciusinfinite> where we at chat?
[0:39:03] <+Stupid121v2> feels like boneless modern yakuza
[0:39:06] <DatAsuna> 3 added a lot of what became the formula yeah
[0:39:06] <brachydios777> That‚Äôs fair
[0:39:07] <%kewlmyc> You probably can
[0:39:12] <+Deko_> LUL
[0:39:12] <leith_aziz> 5 Only gets worse because it tries to build a mystery, same with 4
[0:39:14] <brunoberserk> OOOOFF
[0:39:18] <Darren716> That's not hard V
[0:39:19] <Wofoeh> @notsoy dude, I KNOW FOR A FACT, that that quest only shows up AFTER you do the producer one (for some reason)
[0:39:19] <@Menitta> Oh god
[0:39:19] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL LUL LUL
[0:39:21] <andre11dr> I liked where it went in 2 ,i know it's kinda dumb but i like that about it
[0:39:21] <@Menitta> thats the worst
[0:39:26] <%SilverDevilfish> 5 may prevent that
[0:39:28] <+QueequegTheater> I think he can get to 7, but beating it?
[0:39:29] <PsychoPearl> 5 is pretty long
[0:39:29] <leith_aziz> interesting
[0:39:30] <Timarkot> Did woolie grind offscreen
[0:39:31] <Pnutz409> lol
[0:39:31] <@Menitta> They are the same with progressively worse editing
[0:39:31] <+FireBallSuper> Should I just play 3 on easy so I can get through it quicker?
[0:39:31] <+Liquid_Dio> Same with John Wick
[0:39:32] <%notsoy> @Wofoeh the dominatrix quest? absolutely not
[0:39:32] <%dukenux> Oh no, the camera shakes
[0:39:35] <DSD24> Supremacy was not as good
[0:39:36] <%Asuterisuku> Only playing once a week is going to make this take forever.
[0:39:36] <LVL1_Scumbag> Like Transformers
[0:39:37] <DatAsuna> 5 is my personal fave
[0:39:39] <%notsoy> you're confusing that with the follow-up quest involving miracle
[0:39:39] <ChansonNoire> same with john wick yeah
[0:39:40] <ghoststalker> 4 is cool for introducing kick man and Bear man
[0:39:46] <%notsoy> check the cyricz guides my guy
[0:39:48] <iswearimjustdandy> Those movies suck ass

[0:39:57] <+talkingrain3139> 5 is long as fuck but is amazing
[0:39:57] <OokamiDen02> that's why 4 is great
[0:39:58] <astrophizz> They're (especially 2) like the Dear Sister SNL skit
[0:39:58] <%dukenux> i'd be okay with Bourne ending in 3 movies tbh
[0:39:58] <%aram909> 4is great because akiyama rules and also its the most ACAB the games get
[0:40:00] <KingVantq> @FireBallSuper unless you care about 100%ing it yeah
[0:40:02] <Pnutz409> f&F series
[0:40:04] <leith_aziz> I think he gets really fun in 6
[0:40:05] <Wofoeh> Oh absolutely, 5 is gonna be a H U R D L E
[0:40:08] <+runegod20> the humanizing moments for kiryu are good, which I feel 3 did really good
[0:40:08] <+Grim1952> It's good they retired Kiryu
[0:40:10] <DatAsuna> Tanimura is my fave from 4
[0:40:11] <leith_aziz> I loved him there
[0:40:14] <LVL1_Scumbag> You look like a criminal?
[0:40:15] <shurtal> Kiryu is the bus you pilot while plot happens around him
[0:40:16] <%ThirdRatePunk> ThirdRatePunk subscribed with Prime.
[0:40:17] <+bPlusPlus> oh

[0:40:50] <DatAsuna> @QueequegTheater He was my fave and the new haircut looks awful
[0:40:52] <+RJay80> Himbo Aura
[0:40:55] <%Livelinne> joofbHmm
[0:41:01] <%X2Eliah> Man Kiryu is surprisingly closed-minded
[0:41:08] <%X2Eliah> did not even want to do the hustle
[0:41:08] <servicesuspension> he's like 20
[0:41:30] <%Livelinne> but he has a sugar daddy

[0:41:36] <brachydios777> Kiryu later on is actually really accepting of people
[0:41:36] <+QueequegTheater> I'm expecting 8 guys with guns to be in there
[0:41:54] <+runegod20> you can tell it's dragon and tiger since they just reuse the inside pretty much

[0:42:11] <digitalslime> i never found this
[0:42:14] <ghoststalker> Oh, I knew I noticed the dragon and tiger characters on the door
[0:42:18] <leith_aziz> Compare Kiryu here, than compare that to 5 and 6
[0:42:19] <LVL1_Scumbag> He just wants to run his restaurant
[0:42:23] <servicesuspension> That's not even related
[0:42:24] <+runegod20> i've seen so many playthroughs of 0 where the person never finds the dragon and tiger for kiryu until end game, it's super missable
[0:42:27] <%X2Eliah> Man I did not expect the secret weapon-smith cover restaurant to be a feaking FRANCHISE
[0:42:28] <Wofoeh> Same shit different day
[0:42:32] <leith_aziz> There's obviously a difference
[0:42:40] <%Lion_kun> BUY THE ZAP GUN
[0:42:59] <%Livelinne> man I want some ramen + gyoza
[0:43:02] <+QueequegTheater> No one needs the zap gun
[0:43:02] <leith_aziz> I actually missed this shop my first playthrough
[0:43:04] <%aram909> get the zap gun, and proceed to win every single shakedown from now on
[0:43:06] <HollowMan190> cool......wepons are unless till 7/5
[0:43:16] <rusho> Mr. Shakedown fears the zap bubbly2Smug
[0:43:18] <Wofoeh> @x2eliah I‚Äôll have an dagger, a katana, 2 slime guns.... and some dumplings please
[0:43:28] <servicesuspension> He just wants to grill goddamit
[0:43:31] <leith_aziz> Slimegun is also effective, but more hilarious
[0:43:38] <+runegod20> i don't think woolie did too much of the agent stuff so I assume he doesn't have much stuff to buy
[0:43:44] <+Grim1952> Just give em a staminan

[0:43:49] <%Livelinne> LUL
[0:43:49] <ghoststalker> @hollowman190 not true, the speed run for 3 depends on buying guns
[0:43:51] <+QueequegTheater> You don't need the zap gun to beat shakedown you just need the drunken master upgrade for Brawler

[0:44:55] <+runegod20> the yakuza universe is a place where the streets of japan are flooded with barbarians called Hooligans
[0:44:57] <brachydios777> Considering how much Yakuza use swords and shit in this universe

[0:48:32] <+QueequegTheater> Ooh maybe we can do a quick 50 pull
[0:48:42] <+runegod20> a basic dagger like that is super common and generic
[0:48:44] <%dukenux> It's one of those contact stun guns
[0:48:50] <%dukenux> its not a tazer
[0:48:51] <digitalslime> like stun gun actualy stagers
[0:48:52] <%CalderGaming> no?????

[0:48:57] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Ehhhh
[0:48:58] <superchunk121> What?
[0:48:58] <$dudedude55555> a gun is a knife as well, it's just ranged
[0:49:01] <Pnutz409> progressive knife
[0:49:01] <%doomerskeletor13> Star Wars Vibro Knife
[0:49:01] <SomersaultJustice> it's like a tiny spear
[0:49:04] <%X2Eliah> ...
[0:49:04] <+Grim1952> It's a baton maybe
[0:49:04] <%Asuterisuku> You have to do a bunch of weapon gathering with Majima in order to unlock more things.
[0:49:05] <%Afterman_> a taser is just a long range knife
[0:49:06] <%X2Eliah> damn
[0:49:06] <%dukenux> yep, it's melee
[0:49:06] <servicesuspension> Resident Evil 1 says stun guns and knives work the same
[0:49:07] <brachydios777> Kinda
[0:49:09] <%X2Eliah> it is
[0:49:09] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:49:10] <%BinaryFireball> god Im reminded of that co2 knife
[0:49:12] <%Livelinne> wooliePOYO MorphinTime
[0:49:12] <+runegod20> i don't know where else to classify a taser
[0:49:16] <CappuccinoGuil> This is NOT a stun gun, for sure.
[0:49:18] <+runegod20> stun gun i mean
[0:49:20] <%aram909> eh, knives still break skin and draw blood
[0:49:20] <+bPlusPlus> knives are keys too because they unlock your death
[0:49:20] <%X2Eliah> STUN GUN IS A STAR WARS KNIFE
[0:49:22] <%aram909> stun guns don't

[0:49:35] <fIashman92> Only Kiryu has sledge hammer heat moves fyi
[0:49:36] <%Chatterbox1991> I mean Taser Darts are technically a gun @woolieversus
[0:49:38] <andre11dr> I mean isn't there actual electric knifes?
[0:49:41] <%jonblnt> stun gun is still a one handed weapon
[0:49:46] <CappuccinoGuil> Do Stars also indicate durability?
[0:49:49] <$dudedude55555> technically, your hands are knives
[0:49:51] <%dukenux> Nickelodeon Gun
[0:49:57] <+Grim1952> Brass knucles have an special heat move i think
[0:49:59] <@Solidus_113> could it be in the item box?
[0:50:01] <+runegod20> knuckles could be good for rush
[0:50:05] <%dukenux> monkaS
[0:50:07] <%Asuterisuku> Brass Knuckles are REALLY good with Rush.
[0:50:11] <+QueequegTheater> HOW IS THAT SAFE
[0:50:12] <digitalslime> shoot fire
[0:50:12] <diontmack> slime guns absolutely fuck shakedown
[0:50:13] <servicesuspension> @shurtal You think that's fucking weird? Taser means Thomas A Swift's Electric Rifle. Thomas A Swift is not a real person
[0:50:14] <Wofoeh> @woolieversus and the taser also shares the move set with the knives, so it adds up
[0:50:15] <%AlteisenReiseZ> USE THE HEAT MOVE WITH IT.
[0:50:19] <%dukenux> do you use it with a hairspray
[0:50:31] <srv4254> "storage"

[0:51:22] <andre11dr> Kiryu doesn't get the cigarette move in this dosen't he?
[0:51:23] <%cobalt_phoenix_> Buy 1ups
[0:51:27] <%big_laser_boss> Mew Mew shoes
[0:51:38] <+runegod20> and even without that, it has nice stats
[0:51:39] <CappuccinoGuil> STATS, THO
[0:51:42] <+Mendin> I mean considering how much running around Kamurocho he's doing, comfy shoes sound important
[0:51:53] <CappuccinoGuil> The stats on that traveler's amulet, though
[0:51:55] <+runegod20> one is magic pixel, one is a self ref kind of
[0:51:56] <servicesuspension> Never underestimate comfy shoes
[0:51:57] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @big_laser_boss soon tm
[0:52:11] <+Ether101_Prime> @andre11dr I don't think so.
[0:52:20] <%big_laser_boss> New moves > stats
[0:52:24] <AhmCha> Ehhhhhh
[0:52:38] <+Grim1952> Knuckles!
[0:52:39] <mortificent> Kinda, depends on the game
[0:52:45] <+QueequegTheater> On Legend it does but Hard is not a huge jump from Normal
[0:52:54] <servicesuspension> How do you buy a slime gun in 2021
[0:52:57] <Ultrahalda> on the amon army in kiwami 2 on legend its useful
[0:52:59] <+runegod20> does the shop use the weapons that you find or only weapons that you craft as majima?
[0:53:00] <%big_laser_boss> The mew mew she's work in cut-scenes
[0:53:06] <@Solidus_113> There's a whole questline for upgrading the "Nameless Katana"
[0:53:16] <NotHereToStream> slime shotgun is an anti shakedown weapon iirc
[0:53:19] <+Ether101_Prime> What about the Spicy Knife?
[0:53:26] <CappuccinoGuil> Repair time?
[0:53:29] <DatAsuna> 5 also has the best katana moves
[0:53:32] <ricky12k1> Wait till woolie gets further in the yakuza series there‚Äôs a lot more wacky stuff
[0:53:37] <Solidnick18> it's very good
[0:53:41] <+runegod20> extra knuckles for rush sounds good, though right now they'd only be the crap ones
[0:53:45] <+Grim1952> Kiryu goes akimbo
[0:54:00] <@Solidus_113> Kiryu loaded up like a real gamer
[0:54:05] <Wofoeh> Slime is the shit

[0:54:23] <mortificent> Wait, V is up to 4?? damn
[0:54:25] <CappuccinoGuil> It's the 80s LUL
[0:54:27] <Solidnick18> yep
[0:54:31] <%Asuterisuku> Man, you get a lot of INVENTORY SPACE in this game.
[0:54:31] <+Grim1952> In other Yakuza you gotta earn the money
[0:54:33] <+Deko_> pretty handy we are buddies with the cop now
[0:54:37] <%big_laser_boss> Knuckles are really good for rush
[0:54:38] <+KymeraKirsty> it's the 80s!
[0:54:40] <Prevot> very accurate depiction of japanese economy
[0:54:40] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Woolie there is a pair of Brawler upgrades that make Heat moves take off an entire bar of Shakedown's health
[0:54:48] <+runegod20> manga is made to be super low level gear
[0:54:49] <Solidnick18> other ones you gotta grind for skill points
[0:54:50] <CappuccinoGuil> Traveler's Amulet is better than the belt, though
[0:54:55] <+Liquid_Dio> i feel like Kiryu disproportionately gets shitty healing items for random encounters compared to Majima
[0:54:57] <ricky12k1> Well yea it‚Äôs 80s japan. They had a lot money to burn back then
[0:55:06] <ricky12k1> Before the bubble popped
[0:55:14] <Wofoeh> @woolieversus slime gun is good for when you‚Äôre feeling lazy vs an shakedown
[0:55:15] <%Asuterisuku> Woolie should go see his trainers.
[0:55:17] <servicesuspension> It's the 80's, go to an anime con and watch high quality ovas
[0:55:17] <%aram909> If you want to grind and get big big money against Mr Shakedown, theres a specific shotgun-like gun called the Zap Gun you can get by like Chapter 7 or 8 which will take down literally 2/3 of an entire shakedown's healthbar. 3 hours will net you easily close to 500 billion or so yen
[0:55:19] <chainsaw105> we can do more bacchus training
[0:55:21] <%X2Eliah> 100 kks
[0:55:21] <%big_laser_boss> Thank God Woolie understands the value of Quick-change clothes
[0:55:21] <%Javaa01> Gotta start hitting up those style trainers
[0:55:23] <alvaroeltz> talk to bacchus and unlock the moces
[0:55:26] <alvaroeltz> move*
[0:55:26] <+runegod20> the later games do kind of have lower money costs , which fits with giving less money
[0:55:46] <%RyTYoung> OH GOD
[0:55:50] <Solidnick18> he's a man on a mission woolie
[0:55:56] <+Chronobot> The ultimate life form lurks everywhere
[0:55:56] <%BallerSwagBro9k> SHAKEDOWN EVERYWHERE SYSTEM
[0:55:57] <%dukenux> He's lurking in the backrooms...
[0:56:13] <%Asuterisuku> You complained about that last week.
[0:56:13] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:56:28] <servicesuspension> I'LL KILL YOU
[0:56:28] <@Solidus_113> NEMESIS SYSTEM?
[0:56:28] <%big_laser_boss> Swap style mid attack
[0:56:32] <+ShinNoir> @aram909 you can actually get it immediately from the million yen dream machines. i got it in chapter 2 recently and its great
[0:56:37] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus "Would you like to take my asskicking survey"
[0:56:37] <rookielime> Are you doing remastered? God that sounds so annoying
[0:56:41] <%X2Eliah> Isn't Nemesis system also patented?
[0:56:42] <servicesuspension> You can't have nemesis system now :C
[0:56:43] <+Negus_Rex> the Rapper in 4 is great though
[0:56:48] <@Menitta> Its like Pokemon. "You're walking on route 216? I'LL KILL YOU!"
[0:56:54] <+Ether101_Prime> You look like a Yakuza, I'll kill ya'!
[0:56:55] <joshua_42> V how are you feeling about the first new character compared to Kiryu
[0:56:56] <%doomerskeletor13> Oh that‚Äôs a good one
[0:56:58] <%dukenux> Walkman
[0:57:00] <Wofoeh> @woolieversus V remind woolie to do the producer sidequest, to start the progress of getting the encounter finder
[0:57:03] <rookielime> Patenting mechanics is the goddamn worst idea.
[0:57:04] <DSD24> Youngster Joey wants to kill you with his Ratata
[0:57:06] <$dudedude55555> ARA-Q3 is amazing
[0:57:11] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YEYEYEYYEYEYE
[0:57:11] <Jp_DrZaius> yeyeye
[0:57:12] <willyfreshness> producer is important
[0:57:20] <Solidnick18> the producer one is pretty good
[0:57:23] <%big_laser_boss> Swap style mid attack
[0:57:26] <JayEarly> You remember Kiryu, when you punch in the face a hundred times?
[0:57:27] <%Asuterisuku> Roughly 100 side quests.
[0:57:28] <Wofoeh> BOTH are great
[0:57:37] <servicesuspension> Patenting mechanics is scummy shit. The only thing scummier is that time Candy Crush tried to trademark the word Saga
[0:57:38] <+QueequegTheater> @Asuterisuku exactly 100
[0:57:39] <Solidnick18> oh yeah the masters
[0:57:41] <+Mendin> Echoes of Liam from the Nier:Automata playthrough going "Best track in the game coming up right here"
[0:57:45] <dead_harmony13> Have you found the dominatrix yet?
[0:57:45] <%big_laser_boss> FADC drop-kicks
[0:57:50] <ricky12k1> Playing a yakuza game is playing all side quests
[0:57:52] <CharlieDJohnson> only bad sidequests are the pocket racer sidequests because theyre tied to pocket racer, and i regret nothing of what i just said
[0:57:58] <%doomerskeletor13> Bacchus has some good moves
[0:58:03] <+runegod20> baccus is the quickest one to do the training for
[0:58:06] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Funniest thing about the whole "Punks going up to Kiryu and getting their asses handed to them" It's gang initiation
[0:58:07] <%Asuterisuku> Hey yeah, Woolie, go check your money!
[0:58:08] <+runegod20> and gives good stuff
[0:58:11] <servicesuspension> @CharlieDJohnson I also regret what you just said
[0:58:23] <%r0chelimit> You can‚Äôt go wrong with training honestly
[0:58:24] <$dudedude55555> @CharlieDJohnson mods ban this man, it's pat in disguise
[0:58:28] <ricky12k1> @charliedjohnson well be prepared to get hunted by pocket circuit racers
[0:58:30] <fIashman92> You forgot the porn card finder, the most important item
[0:58:31] <Ultrahalda> and also becoming a LEGEND
[0:58:37] <%doomerskeletor13> You can do the real estate grinding while you do substories too
[0:58:41] <Solidnick18> very good reward for that
[0:58:44] <%big_laser_boss> Has Woolie trained his dominatrix?
[0:58:44] <servicesuspension> Real estate is so good
[0:58:45] <OblivionSword1> Business in 0 is MANDATORY
[0:58:55] <servicesuspension> I wish I was a real estate guy
[0:58:59] <%dukenux> real estate is a proper secondary game in this
[0:59:10] <jaygee303> It‚Äôs very important for an insane ass counter
[0:59:11] <CappuccinoGuil> LET'S GO REAL STATE
[0:59:12] <+QueequegTheater> COUGH COUGH
[0:59:14] <@Menitta> Its free
[0:59:15] <Solidnick18> Say whaaat
[0:59:19] <+Ancopro> real estate has removed my limits
[0:59:22] <+runegod20> my friend delayed doing real estate until the end of the game and after he did all the side stories, so he was really bored waiting to collect money
[0:59:24] <%Livelinne> shiaLUL
[0:59:29] <%dukenux> *whispers* It's Real Estate
[0:59:29] <servicesuspension> only through real estate you can unlock your GOUGI

[1:10:59] <leith_aziz> Well, you ain't DIO so....
[1:11:02] <%dukenux> this is just a jpeg cutout of food
[1:11:02] <+runegod20> i never paid attention to the resturant
[1:11:04] <Solidnick18> hmmm
[1:11:04] <+QueequegTheater> Wesker did it
[1:11:05] <ricky12k1> Or ask the audience
[1:11:05] <rcand9> Glass her
[1:11:07] <Timarkot> Don't overthink it, its just an eraser Kappa
[1:11:16] <%RyTYoung> I put the eraser on the table NotLikeThis
[1:11:18] <daniphofani> to erase the food off your face after you eat
[1:11:27] <leith_aziz> Wolf among us flashbacks
[1:11:31] <+runegod20> maybe to modify a script since poeple on sets and stuff do all get like their own copy of the script that they annotate by hand, at least in theater
[1:11:33] <%Halospaz117> Booo, correct option
[1:11:33] <%gatorafan> Don't worry Woolie, the eraser said it was sorry Kappa
[1:11:35] <leith_aziz> "glass" her
[1:11:39] <+runegod20> probably for notes too
[1:11:39] <%Halospaz117> The knife is so funny
[1:11:40] <%Asuterisuku> Can you just imagine if he'd brought the knife?
[1:11:46] <%X2Eliah> uuuuuhhh
[1:11:46] <%TigerCatGo> Eraser her.
[1:11:48] <GarbageNirvana> Turns out this is a different kind of Japanese TV show and Kiryu's got a secret camera on him
[1:11:51] <%X2Eliah> uuuuuhhhhh what is this
[1:11:52] <DSD24> Vanillaware Food is so good
[1:11:52] <CharlieDJohnson> eraser is the funniest imo for the slow zoom in on the lone eraser in front of the woman on an otherwise empty table

[1:12:00] <%Livelinne> woolieOMG
[1:12:01] <LVL1_Scumbag> I thought that was a korean thing
[1:12:06] <Wofoeh> Daro? DARO??
[1:12:06] <%Halospaz117> I think Kiryu just flat out says the knife is what you want to use if you want to erase someone
[1:12:10] <+runegod20> you need to get the money shot, especially if food is the big thing they're doing
[1:12:14] <+QueequegTheater> Wait is that actual food
[1:12:15] <servicesuspension> No, the most japanese thing is describing food in uncomfortable detail, I hate when they do that in anime
[1:12:16] <%X2Eliah> COME ON THAT IS NOT A THING

[1:12:32] <%TheShisno> Cereal commercials use glue water, right?
[1:12:34] <HollowMan190> hes filming the food scene from matrix reloaded
[1:12:36] <DSD24> Don't they drill shit into the food
[1:12:38] <%dukenux> there's a whole art in making food pictures
[1:12:40] <@Solidus_113> That fake food stuff is crazy
[1:12:46] <CharlieDJohnson> the enxt question has only one acceptable answer and i hope thats what they pick
[1:12:48] <%SilvaChariot0133> ehhhhh
[1:12:50] <Wofoeh> @dsd24 yep
[1:12:50] <+runegod20> i've seen a few places with fake display food, but the fake display food always felt weird to me
[1:12:55] <CastellanVon> Food presentation where you cook the food to look good is some crazy cool stuff.
[1:13:01] <+Ancopro> but the pic on the menu is ALSO a lie
[1:13:03] <%dukenux> you take a chicken leg and glaze it in hairspray to get the right shen
[1:13:05] <%dukenux> *sheen
[1:13:06] <iswearimjustdandy> I love fake food presentations
[1:13:12] <LVL1_Scumbag> Everything is lies
[1:13:15] <+vaderxyz1970> Fake Good with DUST

[1:13:35] <leith_aziz> I don't know, first time I encountered that word
[1:13:38] <DSD24> This soup needs A GUN
[1:13:40] <Wofoeh> @dsd24 in those commercials where they do the ‚ÄúPull away pizza‚Äù shots, they nail down the adjacent slices
[1:13:41] <Karego_at> yummy all this raw meat
[1:13:43] <%dukenux> this feels like a commercial
[1:13:45] <LVL1_Scumbag> Maybe it's an older term
[1:13:48] <+runegod20> i haven't heard of it but i only have some collage theater experience
[1:13:51] <iswearimjustdandy> Are they filming a food review?
[1:13:53] <CastellanVon> Making 100 grilled cheese sandwiches so you can get the perfect pulled cheese shot when cutting it in half
[1:13:53] <+QueequegTheater> Give me a pizza that big and I'll show you how to erase shit

[1:16:22] <%wibbwobbler> kiyru shines
[1:16:22] <rookielime> can't believe you didn't punch it
[1:16:23] <+runegod20> at least "Striking" is a specific phase of a production and an actual production term
[1:16:23] <%TheShisno> Insult the props!
[1:16:26] <%phd_in_thuggery> Yeah that makes sense!
[1:16:27] <+Idziman> Kiryu solves problems with his fists
[1:16:27] <willyfreshness> these dishes are pathetic!
[1:16:28] <+b_aleph> You totally botched this quest by picking the right answers
[1:16:33] <rcand9> i would highly recommend you redo this just to see the botches they are amazing!
[1:16:34] <+runegod20> jeering i've never heard before
[1:16:34] <Solidnick18> sure did
[1:16:38] <servicesuspension> They're the kind of assholes who forgot everyone else doesn't know. Like that one friend who plays way too many MMO and can't talk like a normal person anymore
[1:16:47] <CharlieDJohnson> woolie only got the very first question right
[1:16:52] <%phd_in_thuggery> as this man speaks in his industry riddles 3
[1:16:56] <Solidnick18> wow that easy
[1:16:57] <%Asuterisuku> Keep this save file for later use.
[1:16:59] <+runegod20> also talking like that would kind of give away that you don't know you stuff
[1:17:02] <%OfficerMods> fighting game metaphor
[1:17:02] <+b_aleph> booooooo, woolie, booooo
[1:17:07] <%X2Eliah> Honestly this is exactly like using fight game lingo for non-fighting-game stuff
[1:17:10] <willyfreshness> he hasnt harrassed anyone so he is a good producer
[1:17:10] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Woolie is too focused on getting the right answers
[1:17:16] <servicesuspension> I still believe this video was a fetish thing
[1:17:18] <%big_laser_boss> No. Woolie do good.
[1:17:18] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:17:21] <%gatorafan> that bar is set super high Kappa
[1:17:24] <%AMUSERNAME> They call you a Producer because you're really good at filming Produce
[1:17:25] <+runegod20> what stand sells only popsicles?
[1:17:32] <%Livelinne> Azaaaaaas
[1:17:39] <DSD24> Producer can you do a Okizemi real quick?
[1:17:40] <+Crippl3> @AMUSERNAME holy shit
[1:17:42] <%phd_in_thuggery> @x2eliah you don't call using your turn blinkers Pressuring other drivers?
[1:17:42] <Wofoeh> Kiryu is the best producer because HES ACTUALLY BEING USEFUL
[1:17:43] <%big_laser_boss> No booing for Woolie, he did good
[1:17:45] <servicesuspension> Can I keep the clothes
[1:18:06] <Equirah> @WillyFresh992 he harrassed the girl as soon as she showed up and kept doing so
[1:18:10] <+QueequegTheater> yes
[1:18:13] <rcand9> YES
[1:18:17] <rcand9> 100%

[1:21:30] <fIashman92> Most heat moves don't work while running. It's kinda annoying
[1:21:33] <+runegod20> don't you also have to be rush for it?
[1:21:35] <%Javaa01> @WoolieVersus Just check how to do the heat move from the movelist
[1:21:37] <+Ether101_Prime> I think it isn't the right style for brass knuckles.

[1:26:17] <DatAsuna> gamejam crunch fun, but it's voluntary

[1:26:22] <LVL1_Scumbag> SMALL doses being the important part
[1:26:24] <+jiggy_snipe> is Woolie crunching himself right now?
[1:26:26] <%Asuterisuku> Wait for the Premium Adventure.
[1:26:30] <%phd_in_thuggery> Woolie, Crunch woolieGLORY
[1:26:30] <+runegod20> NG+, and post game
[1:26:30] <For_Temeria> Nah premium adventure only
[1:26:32] <rcand9> you do get it
[1:26:34] <%baka_sugoi> after game unlock
[1:26:34] <OblivionSword1> on premium adventure you get it
[1:26:35] <Explodincatz> why would u play on NG+?
[1:26:36] <%Javaa01> During NG+ you can just use whatever outfit you want
[1:26:42] <%doomerskeletor13> Any outfit that Kiryu wears is available in NGL+
[1:26:44] <Blank9> postgame and ng+ give you a lot of outfits
[1:26:44] <Prevot> they never let you switch clothes on 1st playthrough sadly
[1:26:47] <Blank9> including the karaoke outfits
[1:26:57] <+Crippl3> The best change they made in Like A Dragon is that you have access to costume change on your first playthrough
[1:26:57] <+runegod20> the knuckle heat moves are also in rush style
[1:26:58] <%LastHazzerd> @DatAsuna honestly i always wondered why folk loved gamejams, since it seemed like a promotion for crunch culture
[1:27:01] <KingVantq> @Explodincatz if you didnt do stuff during your first playthrough
[1:27:01] <%phd_in_thuggery> Postgame is so fun
[1:27:10] <%doomerskeletor13> So yeah I forgot, that substory was ok but the substory it leads into is way better
[1:27:12] <%OfficerMods> actually imagine a Japanese studio even acknowledging the concept of crunch
[1:27:16] <ARDM112> Brass Knuckles are in Rush
[1:27:19] <fIashman92> It's just a slideshow of Kiryu not killing people
[1:27:19] <Wofoeh> @WoolieVersus Oh uh, Brass knucks is related to Rush

[1:27:35] <%Asuterisuku> Pretty sure it was a timing thing.
[1:27:37] <For_Temeria> There are knuckles moves in the rush tree
[1:27:39] <ARDM112> Rush has special heat moves for knuckles
[1:27:40] <DatAsuna> @LastHazzerd Because it's for fun, voluntary and like a competition between friends
[1:27:43] <glaciusinfinite> passed it up
[1:27:44] <servicesuspension> gamejam is not different from speed painting
[1:27:48] <+runegod20> without the heat moves, the only knuckle heat moves you have are for enemies on the ground, which are normal heat moves you can do already
[1:27:49] <%phd_in_thuggery> Essence of Biting the Curb
[1:27:50] <DatAsuna> If you job said you had to do it, that would suck
[1:27:52] <%cobalt_phoenix_> the pole move is on beast right?

[1:28:19] <brachydios777> Knuckles are in the rush tree
[1:28:21] <+runegod20> i imagine there's better knuckles with better durability, but the basic kunckles are weak
[1:28:28] <servicesuspension> I say fuck weapons and just give me more punchy kickies
[1:28:30] <Vigogs> that's why you get better weapons from the majima weapon thing
[1:28:35] <DatAsuna> and we get a fun dumb indie game to play at the end
[1:28:37] <+runegod20> but they're cheap so you can get like 3 of them in your inventory for nothing
[1:28:40] <%RyTYoung> I do that too
[1:28:40] <fIashman92> Brass knuckles don't wear down so long as you have less than one bar
[1:28:41] <%krispen_wa> Irrashaimase
[1:28:43] <digitalslime> you can get unbreakable stuff but they aren't very strong
[1:28:47] <valriot> I always felt like in BOTW in encouraged creativity, so it never bothered me at all
[1:28:51] <ARDM112> You can get shitty weapons with infinite durability later through Majima
[1:28:54] <%X2Eliah> man, I hate games with weapon durability
[1:28:55] <rcand9> you can get some modded weapons with great durability in 3
[1:28:57] <%phd_in_thuggery> also on the topic of crunch, I once worked 11 hour shifts 6 nights a week for 4 weeks..... and it was my second job ever
[1:28:58] <%X2Eliah> it's just busywork
[1:29:04] <akman14> I dont mind durability in F:NV
[1:29:05] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Kiwami 2 fixes it with a skill that repairs any weapon that isn't broken when you switch to a new weapon
[1:29:05] <%big_laser_boss> Woolie needs to find the mushroom seller
[1:29:06] <%OfficerMods> kenka bancho had a good weapon system
[1:29:21] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @phd_in_thuggery how are you alive
[1:29:26] <+Crippl3> ...what era is that
[1:29:33] <%Asuterisuku> Yakuza revels in the stupid.
[1:29:38] <Darren716> YES
[1:29:39] <%OfficerMods> the weapon last forever but your badass goes down as you use it
[1:29:40] <%TheShisno> Zero's durability I like because you can repair what you like and most weapons play different by category.

[2:09:21] <OblivionSword1> most weapon work with brawler
[2:09:27] <ARDM112> There are no heat actions for swords in 0 because Komaki teaches them in 1
[2:09:28] <+runegod20> knuckles only have unique ones for rush, and there's one or two random unique ones for beast
[2:09:31] <Wofoeh> @WoolieVersus Brass Knucks Heat actions for Rush
[2:09:32] <%Asuterisuku> It's basically just NOT RUSH.
[2:09:34] <R3c0n31> That is so a simple Heat move, that is just scary
[2:09:45] <user_naim> Punisher it
[2:09:47] <ghoststalker> Swords need training in 1 first
[2:09:48] <%big_laser_boss> USE THE QUICK-CHANGE CLOTHES
[2:09:49] <OblivionSword1> there's also bikes you can grab
[2:10:03] <%big_laser_boss> FADC DROP-KICKS
[2:10:12] <%Asuterisuku> Just frame dodging gets you Heat.
[2:10:25] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> Rush + Knuckles
[2:10:31] <user_naim> just Bad Guys, Vile City this punk
[2:10:32] <%big_laser_boss> You can cancel your attacks by swapping styles
[2:10:49] <+runegod20> the one for rush does also require lock on, so it'd be easy to miss
[2:10:51] <%Asuterisuku> Rush + Knuckles requires an upgrade.
[2:11:07] <BlackermanZX> monkaS
[2:11:08] <+RJay80> i know at some point doing the weave in rush style will dodge his attacks
[2:11:10] <%big_laser_boss> Make your attacks safe by style changing
[2:11:20] <Medo3G> I guess that was the back to the wall heat move in rush
[2:11:38] <+QueequegTheater> It really fucks with me that Woolie isn't literally just holding down R1 the entire fight
[2:11:38] <+runegod20> you have to unlock it and it requires a lock on
[2:11:39] <+RJay80> dead?
[2:11:42] <jorniev> oh no
[2:11:44] <+runegod20> which we may or may not have gotten
[2:11:49] <R3c0n31> Here it comes
[2:11:49] <%big_laser_boss> rush has a getup attack
[2:11:52] <OblivionSword1> I think you have brass knuckle heat move for enemy with swords

[2:12:01] <+QueequegTheater> IT WAS AT FULL HEALTH
[2:12:05] <Medo3G> woof
[2:12:07] <BlackermanZX> Oh GOD doodWat
[2:12:07] <R3c0n31> That is legit instant kills
[2:12:10] <+runegod20> the sword heat move is I think locked to real estate
[2:12:11] <%big_laser_boss> and you can cancel that one for an instant get up
[2:12:14] <Timarkot> Wallet
[2:12:21] <@Solidus_113> You're also using gear with bad defense
[2:12:24] <user_naim> jesus christ mr shakedown
[2:12:27] <turbofolk> Fuck
[2:12:27] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> @QueequegTheater His lifebar is tiny. This isn't % damage y'know...
[2:12:29] <daniphofani> I like how there's ONE lady on the side watching and clapping
[2:12:43] <user_naim> This is turning into a triple homicide on one dude
[2:12:44] <%gatorafan> ThankEgg
[2:12:45] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> Beast Bearhug him@
[2:12:49] <%McSoliace> when you don't have space you should probably lock on and dodge
[2:12:57] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus It doesn't matter, stomp 1HKO's you at full health
[2:12:58] <servicesuspension> That happens in the movie
[2:13:01] <servicesuspension> I shit you not
[2:13:02] <djblue_shift> just like skyrim lol
[2:13:03] <%big_laser_boss> @solidus_113 He needs to utilize the Quick-change clothes
[2:13:09] <andre11dr> Switch to Brawlers and blade him
[2:13:10] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> Beast L1+O
[2:13:11] <%jonblnt> it looks like there's more space at the crossroad of the street
[2:13:17] <+KillMyPast> Quick change with Brawler is godlike
[2:13:17] <+Idziman> Staminan Royales are the cheese wheels of Kamurocho
[2:13:20] <Medo3G> time for the classic I guess
[2:13:22] <+QueequegTheater> HOLD R1
[2:13:28] <digitalslime> Knuckles requirer a skill i think
[2:13:28] <jotabranded> just wait for him to attack close to a wall.. 50% just there
[2:13:32] <ARDM112> There are no sword heat moves in this. Kiryu gets taught swordsmanship in 1 and Majima sticks to the bat.
[2:13:32] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:13:33] <%dukenux> he still has a full meter going on
[2:13:34] <digitalslime> for rush
[2:13:37] <%big_laser_boss> STYLE CHANGE TO CANCEL RECOVERY
[2:13:40] <OblivionSword1> not the best arena for mr shakedown
[2:13:48] <jorniev> Seriously the business quest is important so you don't mind losing to these guys
[2:13:49] <turbofolk> heavy breathing woolie is feeling the heat
[2:13:57] <+runegod20> our quick steps are good enough that we don't have to be unlocked for good dodges
[2:14:01] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Yes you can, lock on
[2:14:05] <+QueequegTheater> and stay locked
[2:14:07] <$dudedude55555> you need zap guns my dude
[2:14:08] <%big_laser_boss> YOU CAN CANEL BY CHANGING STYLES
[2:14:09] <+KillMyPast> I feel like Woolie still doesnt understand what the point of Quick Change is
[2:14:16] <%X2Eliah> oh jeez this is rough
[2:14:17] <djblue_shift> does anyone hear dmc3 dante when he charges lol
[2:14:18] <%Asuterisuku> Using Rush here is really messing with him.
[2:14:21] <%Lion_kun> Something Something Zap Gun
[2:14:25] <Karego_at> I get so fuckin nervous with these combos!!!
[2:14:29] <+Damie904> Woolie's played DMC, he fucking better understand the point of it.
[2:14:30] <%big_laser_boss> @killmypast He doesn't
[2:14:38] <jorniev> CLOSE
[2:14:38] <Wofoeh> @Lion_kun Majima needs to find it first
[2:14:38] <%X2Eliah> jeeeeeez
[2:14:39] <Karego_at> just do light+heavy on brawler
[2:14:40] <fIashman92> I've never seen that before
[2:14:40] <KingVantq> good thing the Ultimate battles dont make you fight in a 2 foot ally tdogSmile
[2:14:41] <fluke_LKZ> Tech that throw
[2:14:41] <%Asuterisuku> Almost got 360's
[2:14:41] <servicesuspension> thought he was gonna suck out your soul
[2:14:41] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> @WoolieVersus Plz, use Beast here... Bearhug him.

[2:29:25] <Solidnick18> then find shakedown and shoot him dead
[2:29:25] <+MagiKestral> bullshit, you hit him during royal guard then air trick to his damn face cause it hits where you WERE

[2:30:14] <%notsoy> the fan is considered a hammer weapon type
[2:30:26] <ghoststalker> @fiashman92 thanks
[2:30:31] <user_naim> Getting hit with a Bokken fucking hurts
[2:30:33] <+runegod20> knife is generic but having a knife on hand is always nice
[2:30:37] <$dudedude55555> heavy tsukkomi fan
[2:30:43] <%notsoy> 3 slime guns will probably straight-up finish him off
[2:30:52] <%notsoy> you did like 60% of his HP with the one, and you even missed some shots
[2:30:55] <+Standard_Enemy> GUN
[2:30:56] <+runegod20> can't always find a knife on the street, but i don't know if the knife heat move can be done on shakedown
[2:31:11] <%big_laser_boss> @woolieversus The description for the Quick-change clothes are lies. They don't speed up your style changing animation.

[2:31:37] <+runegod20> slime just do dummy damage
[2:31:48] <+RJay80> Slime em up!
[2:32:25] <Wofoeh> @WoolieVersus VS regular jobbers they're like slipping on the slime and shit, but VS "Bosses" it just does a CHUNK of damage
[2:32:35] <chainsaw105> if you screw up THIS one then you deserve the consequences
[2:32:48] <+QueequegTheater> Everything but the slime gun can go tbh
[2:32:51] <+Awkward_Cyborg> it does have heat moves
[2:32:53] <%chosenjuan42> Has Woolie done Business yet?
[2:32:54] <%Asuterisuku> Swords require a skill.
[2:32:55] <%notsoy> sword does not have heat moves in 0
[2:33:01] <%notsoy> not for kiryu, at least
[2:33:04] <Wofoeh> @chosenjuan42 Doing right now

[2:33:19] <brunoberserk> V , lord of sunlight
[2:33:19] <%big_laser_boss> Shakedown somehow laks elemental resistance, thus slime and zap guns work well
[2:33:25] <ghoststalker> Kiryu needs training in 1 to use swords right first
[2:33:27] <%LastHazzerd> do you unlock heatmoves?

[2:33:49] <digitalslime> good for people spaming block
[2:33:56] <%notsoy> @LastHazzerd some of your heat moves have to be unlocked via upgrades, the majority of them don't
[2:34:01] <@Solidus_113> Katana confirmed no heat moves in Yakuza Zero. Only starting in Kiwami 1

[2:49:17] <%big_laser_boss> beating him now will yield over 550 million
[2:49:29] <%dukenux> Doesn't loosing to them increase the chance of them sleeping?
[2:49:32] <Evendrag> is V jesus?

[2:51:50] <%big_laser_boss> @woolieversus The description for the Quick-change clothes are lies. They don't speed up your style changing animation. They let you CANEL anny attack animation by changing style. The style-changing already comes with a hefty slow down to enemies so it's practically free. Think of it as a FADC from SF4
[2:51:50] <enerkaizer> woolie is loaded
[2:51:52] <%Grimlockfly> @big_laser_boss they need to bowl with bowling alley manager

[2:52:50] <%cobalt_phoenix_> they just need to bump into the people on the beef bowl area
[2:53:00] <chainsaw105> the trick now is to stay locked on and simply dodge out of the way of charges and shoot when the opportunity arises
[2:53:08] <Mattais88> Unless he's leaning against a wall
[2:53:15] <anarchistPastry> its like chasing roaming legendary pokemon

[3:07:52] <%chosenjuan42> 77
[3:07:57] <jotabranded> pink = tap, blue = hold
[3:07:58] <%X2Eliah> 77 LUL
[3:08:00] <+QueequegTheater> @gridib Can't yet
[3:08:01] <lovesosa236> better than sleeping dogs
[3:08:01] <srv4254> tru
[3:08:05] <servicesuspension> Failure is the first step to bigger and more embarrassing failure
[3:08:05] <majindusto> This isn't a complicated rythmn game
[3:08:11] <mortificent> depends
[3:08:17] <brunoberserk> it just me , or is he becoming worse ?
[3:08:18] <gridib> @QueequegTheater Yeah but was he told is all.
[3:08:25] <majindusto> Yes
[3:08:26] <TheMoenia> literally just a qte
[3:08:28] <LVL1_Scumbag> It's a fear AOE
[3:08:30] <%Lion_kun> Why is Woolie so bad at this!(
[3:08:31] <majindusto> lol
[3:08:39] <srv4254> they both have to talk also
[3:08:41] <+vaporousTippler> 10 people are more than 1 crowd.
[3:08:42] <Darren716> Just grind off screen
[3:08:43] <Prevot> I suck ass at rhythm games and even I can do this
[3:08:53] <DatAsuna> The rhythm game in 5 is my fave, that one's basically the miku games sega also makes
[3:08:54] <%Asuterisuku> Woolie, how do you feel about Theatrythm?
[3:08:56] <andre11dr> How was Pat better at this? I'd think Woolie would be better
[3:08:59] <user_naim> You can do it on reaction, in a way
[3:08:59] <BabblingBayou> eh, you'll get used to it
[3:09:01] <%chosenjuan42> We must Bowl
[3:09:03] <heart_ablaze> man why is woolie so bad at this thing he's new to?
[3:09:04] <%Grimlockfly> the sidequests in this one are strong
[3:09:06] <%big_laser_boss> I do hope they do the telephone club minigame. Both for COMPO, content and singers
[3:09:07] <+QueequegTheater> Mostly miss
[3:09:09] <Darren716> andre11dr Because Pat just presses buttons
[3:09:12] <pi_in_the_sci> getting good at outrun is annoying
[3:09:13] <majindusto> THERE ARE NO BAD SUBSTORIES
[3:09:14] <alvaroeltz> There are no stinkers, only blands compared to the others
[3:09:16] <%doughvatkyn> there's stinkers they just get so bad they're good again
[3:09:16] <rcand9> 3 has some good ones

[3:09:24] <+Deko_> OH YEYEYE
[3:09:26] <Darren716> It's the same reason he was good at Rock Band
[3:09:26] <DatAsuna> Kiwami is the worst because you feel forced to do every minigame
[3:09:27] <jotabranded> the best sidequests are in 6 imo
[3:09:27] <+MajorCrasher> telephone club when?
[3:09:29] <%LastHazzerd> writing gets better over time
[3:09:30] <%cobalt_phoenix_> YEYEYE

[3:10:09] <andre11dr> Rare footage of Pat

[3:10:21] <%Asuterisuku> This quest is great.
[3:10:23] <enerkaizer> I still think its wild that japan actually passed laws specifically because of Dragon quest releases. SE for example isn't allowed to release new DQ games on any other day then saturday (No joke)
[3:10:23] <DatAsuna> There's aplayable baby mod
[3:10:25] <%Grimlockfly> gottdamn it pat, stop stealing from children
[3:10:32] <%Asuterisuku> I am CERTAIN that Ichiban was in that line.

[3:11:05] <OblivionSword1> Except Kiryu cry a lot in the series
[3:11:08] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus V, Ichiban was 11 in 1988, he was totally in that line with this kid
[3:11:09] <CharlieDJohnson> afaik its not an actual law, just something they joked about, but it just happens that they also abide by this non-existing law because why not
[3:11:10] <jorniev> THIS IS WHY WOOLIE is playing this GAME
[3:11:10] <skyentombment> CLOSE YOUR HEART BOY
[3:11:11] <Afroperonista> it's not exactly manly tbh

They let you CANEL anny attack animation by changing style. The style-changing already comes with a hefty slow down to enemies so it's practically free. Think of it as a FADC from SF4

[3:36:19] <Vyneci> "So what does the lighter get in trickster?" "IT'S A GUN"
[3:36:21] <%chosenjuan42> Woolie says he mixes up X & Y
[3:36:23] <LittleWulfie> You also do a 'stabbing' attack with a gun if you're not Aiming and Firing
[3:36:30] <%LastHazzerd> i didn't see the ammo count
[3:36:41] <DatAsuna> what does it do in dark slayer?

[3:36:43] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 45 minutes
[3:36:45] <user_naim> Not the most obvious
[3:36:50] <%captaincarl10> the lighter sucks damage wise but it blasts fire out

[3:37:53] <%Javaa01> But yeah the damage is shit and you only get 10 shots with no heat move
[3:37:55] <%dukenux> they take being set on fire like champs
[3:37:58] <%Javaa01> So it's poopy
[3:37:59] <%Asuterisuku> You can get some sick juggles with that.
[3:38:02] <nottotallyoriginal> We sure that's not a flamethrower
[3:38:02] <%cobalt_phoenix_> now knock someone down and use the hammer
[3:38:03] <servicesuspension> this only proves even more that yakuza was always an rpg
[3:38:35] <OblivionSword1> it is an attack 10 weapon

[3:52:32] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus If you want a list of all heat moves, press Y when in the level up screen/sphere grid. It's not ideal but the text descriptions under "Heat Actions" will say required weapons, the colour of the "1st/2nd/3rd" icon on the right indicate the style/heat level. later games do the list a bit better than this one.

[4:06:47] <+runegod20> Wouldn‚Äôt V saying that you play characters outside of kiryu be more of a spoiler?
[4:06:48] <+QueequegTheater> @dudedude55555 no
[4:06:51] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @dudedude55555 some anime guy that does youtube stuff
[4:06:55] <Karego_at> right??

[4:07:35] <SteelSnake93101> Kappa
[4:07:35] <majindusto> "Ethically"
[4:07:35] <akman14> This aint dollars tho

[4:07:42] <rcand9> LUL
[4:07:42] <somedude1013> *cough*
[4:07:42] <+jiggy_snipe> it's not dollars but ok
[4:07:47] <joshua_42> Literally a better Mr. Shakedown
[4:07:49] <Mattais88> It's all owned by the chicken
[4:07:51] <xbb1024> if you make a compelling enough product, sure
[4:08:03] <majindusto> Sigh
[4:08:09] <+runegod20> We easily could have collected like at least 6 more times this stream, it amazing how fast it goes when you upgrade it
[4:08:09] <hkgamingtv> buy some lower tier moves
[4:08:10] <servicesuspension> it's not dollars. It was probably more valuable than dollars at that time
[4:08:18] <%Asuterisuku> More heat is nice to have.
[4:08:19] <majindusto> enigmaDone
[4:08:24] <DatAsuna> btw press Y on this screen for that heat move weapon list you wanted
[4:08:26] <%McSoliace> snatching strike is good in general
[4:08:31] <+runegod20> Health might be worth it to not get dunked on by shakedown
[4:08:38] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> If you invest in only ethical businesses and/or make a good business that treats its employees well, yes, you can. But it's hard.
[4:08:44] <%big_laser_boss> snatching strike is good
[4:08:45] <%Asuterisuku> Snatching Strike is free in 0, it just requires that you're in Heated state.
[4:08:45] <+Trickyvic13> theres a rush move that helps you quickly get back up when knocked down
[4:08:48] <alvaroeltz> finish the bacchus training theres a good move for shakedown there
[4:08:49] <+QueequegTheater> HEALTH
[4:08:50] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> Being unethical is easier, unfortunately.
[4:08:51] <user_naim> Man watching these makes me want to write a Bad Guys appreciation thread
[4:08:51] <Monkeyweed21> save your money for the next part of real estate
[4:08:54] <%Asuterisuku> In Kiwami, they made it cost Heat.
[4:09:00] <hkgamingtv> you're gonna want to invest in your businesses some more so don't overspend here
[4:09:05] <%big_laser_boss> Quick-change clothes help a lot
[4:09:13] <+runegod20> Not getting 1 shot would help alot

[4:21:15] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Riki Takeuchi was so cool, he was the one who ended up designing his own suit. "He saw that he originally wore yellow, but he grew up in the bubble economy, and he said "Those bastards wore purple! *laugh*"
[4:21:19] <zanzibarian_hamster> He's such a greasy bastard, it's great
[4:21:19] <somedude1013> He's such an asshole I love him

[4:23:34] <Wofoeh> This is one of the worse ideas in the entire series, "Here Kiryu, swing first"
[4:23:36] <%big_laser_boss> Try canceling attacks with the Quick-change clothes

[4:26:04] <%big_laser_boss> cancel any heavy finisher by changing style
[4:26:10] <Solidnick18> rush and let some attack you with back against wall
[4:26:15] <Iniudan> @Karego_at Rush is good once you have the upgrade that you dodge while hit.

[4:26:33] <dmtjinni> ASPECT RATIO is a bit off @WoolieVersus
[4:26:35] <%kewlmyc> Lost 10 mill on the deal, but produces 12 mill upon defeat
[4:26:36] <+NopeBadguy> You throw them into the pavement so hard their arms relocate

[4:28:20] <%cache_22> Is the Empty Lot like a place where you do Pocket Racing?
[4:28:27] <%ChoculaUltra> dammit Awano. Stop being so stylish while you're being such a smarmy douche.
[4:28:34] <ghostravens> the empty lot is actually the kiln of the first flame
[4:28:35] <RyuShinden> But Pocket Circuit is the REAL main quest tho D:
[4:28:43] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
[4:28:46] <Monkeyweed21> why is the game so quiet?
[4:28:56] <Karego_at> awano is so quiet :'D
[4:28:57] <hkgamingtv> Yakuza has so many REAL YAKUZA parts
[4:29:06] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> So Kingdom Hearts
[4:29:11] <BerryliciousDefinition> Yeah it is kinda quiet
[4:29:11] <servicesuspension> That comparison fucking hurts
[4:29:16] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Donald looking at Jack Sparrow
[4:29:22] <Sapphire_Breeze> Say fellas, did somebody mention the Door to Darkness?
[4:29:26] <majindusto> Kiryu has Pores too tho?
[4:29:27] <+jiggy_snipe> that's the one
[4:29:32] <hkgamingtv> yeah right Awano, ya fucking slime
[4:29:34] <Iniudan> @QueequegTheater Not really as cannot keep as much presure with other style at least on boss, as other style require you to block or dodge away, rush you just keep the pressure while waving hit away.
[4:29:36] <@akuda_bar> who framed roger rabbit
[4:29:38] <servicesuspension> Kiryu is just too perfect to be real
[4:29:47] <RyuShinden> LOOKS AT THE SUIT THO
[4:30:01] <servicesuspension> Kiryu's suit is fucking awful
[4:30:05] <%kewlmyc> Yeah audio is pretty damn low right now

[4:30:19] <BerryliciousDefinition> I mean....

[4:30:25] <hkgamingtv> Friend's are an ASSET Woolie
[4:30:28] <%big_laser_boss> @iniudan all this talk about the different style, but you can just use them all with the Quick-change clothes
[4:30:30] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> and thats whats so powerful about it
[4:30:33] <%gatorafan> Family-family-family
[4:30:35] <CoffeeSlice> cant hear much of the game
[4:30:38] <majindusto> Game Audio too low :(
[4:30:43] <ghostravens> game's really quiet
[4:30:47] <%cache_22> Yakuza games are like Fast and Furious movies.
[4:30:47] <+RJay80> friends only exist to do heat moves with
[4:30:51] <jorniev> UNLESS YOU PULL A KAISER SOZE
[4:30:54] <hkgamingtv> we can only defeat evil through the power of FRIENDSHIP

[4:54:25] <+runegod20> still, if someone threw 1K on the ground, hell yeah I'd pick it up
[4:54:26] <Hammatime8> Throwing money at poisoned guards in AC was the BEST
[4:54:30] <Mattais88> 100,000

[4:54:32] <GarbageNirvana> Real '89 Joker vibes right now
[4:54:37] <Prevot> this one is okay, but Yakuza does sometimes take some shitty outdated western game mechanichs
[4:54:39] <%dukenux> so a grand
[4:54:40] <OblivionSword1> 100k is nothing
[4:54:44] <%dukenux> in dollars

[5:00:09] <RyuShinden> NO CUT PunOko

[5:00:14] <OblivionSword1> we want long
[5:00:15] <servicesuspension> it gucci
[5:00:16] <%doughvatkyn> take your time
[5:00:19] <+talkingrain3139> NO MAKE IT LONGER
[5:00:21] <%Javaa01> Well luckily we are almost done with shakedown storylines
[5:00:22] <+Sajallday> We want the long
[5:00:23] <+duichenko> Imagine cuts to the manga
[5:00:24] <FirewallStorm> Noooo it great
[5:00:25] <DatAsuna> lowkey editing ruined the tbfp yakuza 4 lp at the end
[5:00:28] <Monkeyweed21> Do shogi and Mahjong offscreen
[5:00:32] <%Javaa01> So that's something that can almost be done off stream
[5:00:32] <mrblack499> yakuza 0 is like over 80 hours so have fun
[5:00:34] <%threeheadedwalrus> threeheadedwalrus subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! Essence of Subscription
[5:00:34] <Mahbonk> Take your time
[5:00:35] <+RawrzorsGrrr> I‚Äôm behind Woolie but still up to 80 hours
[5:00:35] <hkgamingtv> I stayed back for KOTOR but I'm 100% here for this!
[5:00:41] <servicesuspension> Have a pijama party 24 hour yakoozie marathon
[5:00:45] <majindusto> NOTHING IS OFFSCREEN...NO CUTS!!!
[5:00:47] <@Solidus_113> Shakedowns taking 10 minutes each is a little rough
[5:00:58] <BerryliciousDefinition> Free real estate
[5:01:05] <DatAsuna> yeah stuff like that assassin taking ages was a bit rough
[5:01:08] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Free moves is hilarious content on jobbers
[5:01:14] <OblivionSword1> tbf Shakedown is scary to fihgt
[5:01:16] <SomersaultJustice> set real estate, play mahjong, collect money, repeat
[5:01:21] <OblivionSword1> fight
[5:01:23] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I found a way to double ass buster people
[5:01:25] <Darren716> I feel real estate, friendships, and shakedown, and move tutors can be off screen
[5:01:33] <+Homebutton33> thats fair
[5:01:33] <%big_laser_boss> Learn to use the Quick-change clothes. Then Shakedown becomes styling showcase
[5:01:34] <Darren716> Except the final parts of each real estate
[5:01:42] <xbb1024> V should try dreadlocks
[5:01:43] <MelBrooksKA> Yak 0 was one of the longest LPs on the old channels, this is going to be a long one whether you cut corners or not
[5:01:45] <DatAsuna> Ubisoft games have that problem but it sucks, yakuza games make it mostly a good problem
[5:01:45] <mrblack499> not such a thing
[5:01:46] <Mahbonk> much much shorter games
[5:01:46] <hkgamingtv> You don't have to go Jirard Khalili on it but there's LOTS you should do
[5:01:47] <%Chatterbox1991> The Red Dead 2 problem
[5:01:47] <rafflespaddock> too much?? hahahaha laughs in Yakuza 5
[5:01:48] <%Javaa01> If you think this has too much game in the game, by god is 5 gonna be a shock to you
[5:01:51] <%wibbwobbler> LUL
[5:01:53] <fIashman92> But when's more Shogi and Mahjong doh?
[5:01:54] <Mattais88> Not Hyrule Warriors levels, thnak god
[5:01:54] <OblivionSword1> 0 has so much stuffs
[5:01:56] <%cobalt_phoenix_> so 0 is the only one with all that content?
[5:01:57] <Mahbonk> 5 though...
[5:02:01] <%Javaa01> 5 is literally the "eat up piggy" of the franchise
[5:02:03] <servicesuspension> Yakuza 0 Kiryu Version and Majima Version for Gameboy Advance
[5:02:04] <+TrevSmith222> Once you have a quick way to take out Shakedown, and the Deep Pockets perk, money doesn't mean anything.
[5:02:04] <$dudedude55555> no, they all have a lot of content
[5:02:06] <turbofolk> Persona, yakuza, hyrule warriors
[5:02:08] <Mahbonk> 7 as well. But it aint surprising for a JRPG
[5:02:10] <@Solidus_113> LUL that video
[5:02:11] <Potatoidea> Oh no
[5:02:11] <DatAsuna> this is from pre-stream
