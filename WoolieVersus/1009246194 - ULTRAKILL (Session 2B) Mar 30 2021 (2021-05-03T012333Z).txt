[0:04:05] <%faeron93> I hear nothing
[0:04:10] <leith_aziz> Its there
[0:04:10] <EvanDude47> it's the game audio
[0:04:10] <%Afterman_> i honestly think it might be construction
[0:04:12] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> i also hear nothing
[0:04:14] <TreeLeafBoi> Funny
[0:04:14] <PMda2nd> just going to have to deal
[0:04:14] <rusell4> It makes my PS4 pro jet engine too.
[0:04:15] <majindusto> Dammit Minh

[0:04:22] <%Afterman_> i can baaarely hear it
[0:04:25] <PanicSwytch> I don't hear any buzzing
[0:04:28] <leith_aziz> Try playing the game and see if something changes ?
[0:04:31] <+glgzephyr> is this not on console?
[0:04:33] <andre11dr> It's definitely there
[0:04:34] <%KetsuoTaberu> It's like an E-Eflat buzzing sound
[0:04:35] <+Cuon_Alpinus> I think y'all are schizophrenic

[0:04:48] <Awarets> it'll probably sound fine once you're actually playing the game
[0:04:51] <+blink289> is it just the construction gate
[0:04:52] <+itsgundamu> I don't hear anything with my headphones
[0:04:55] <Awarets> the game sounds will mask it
[0:04:56] <leith_aziz> I hear it. sounds like buzzing
[0:04:58] <%X2Eliah> Any background software running?
[0:04:59] <Meltgar> @WoolieVersus ONLY when you run the game?
[0:05:01] <%Wakiza97> sounds like a faint tea kettle whine
[0:05:02] <%johnny_gogo> sometimes it just stops for a sec too
[0:05:07] <dds333a> the classic
[0:05:09] <ZComiX> Does your laptop have a built in mic?

[0:05:53] <+itsgundamu> ORIGIN BABY
[0:05:53] <%Javaa01> @WoolieVersus If the game is running at an uncapped framerate, it could be that the GPU is pulling so much power that it's reading on the audio chip
[0:05:53] <ergulor> superbEAst

[0:05:55] <+Jiggisnipe> so it was Origin all along

[0:06:04] <%X2Eliah> Yeah now it is just a regular silent background whoooshing hiss

[0:06:07] <+SuperKirby24> YEAAA LUL

[0:06:10] <%Lion_kun> Turn on noise gate?
[0:06:10] <Tracazoid> Arkham, Tekken Advance, It Takes Two. Woolie's PC might need more power to run these beefy games. Kappa

[0:08:26] <dds333a> blown away, oh man
[0:08:26] <mankeymania> Thx buzzfeed
[0:08:27] <Cendov> It'll probably be drowned out by the game audio
[0:08:29] <%Juriasu> truly next gen
[0:08:30] <+chiazam> How loud is it for you and Reggie?
[0:08:31] <MrPedrovsky> EA GO BRRRRRRRRRRRRR
[0:08:34] <%Noonoox12> just go ahead, it's fine
[0:08:38] <$shaidot> Not your fault
[0:08:39] <+Zanzibar_Junker> this isn't great
[0:08:41] <%X2Eliah> Fair
[0:08:47] <%justcallmebobplease> ORIGIN isn't worth it.
[0:08:48] <aiutare47> Absolutely fair
[0:08:51] <+Jiggisnipe> just run it on pc, the noise is faint and your game audio and talking will drown it out
[0:08:52] <andre11dr> Well it's not always like this
[0:08:55] <%johnny_gogo> That is very fair
[0:08:55] <brachydios777> I didn‚Äôt hear any noise from the pc
[0:08:56] <Tracazoid> It's cool Woolie, when that shit happens it's unfortunate.
[0:08:57] <OldManDeckardCain> see, this is why melty is not gonna be on pc Kappa
[0:08:58] <Zantetzuken> understandable
[0:08:58] <+iLike_femboys> being pc masterace is hard
[0:08:58] <+KaijuUltimax> Game Developer with a CS degree here, fuck the PC struggle
[0:08:58] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @RyuuAoi
[0:08:59] <majindusto> PC struggle is BULLSHIT
[0:09:00] <+cursedwithadhd> then go to console just want see you play game
[0:09:00] <+TheotherKristian> It Takes Two, in referrence to the two Origin accounts you need to play it lol
[0:09:00] <%Consumanist> it sound like it's about to start hovering
[0:09:01] <rusell4> Guys please just play the game on whatever
[0:09:01] <Meltgar> Titanfall 2 asks for origin too on steam right?
[0:09:02] <spuddnyk> I just avoid EA in general for this
[0:09:03] <@Menitta> you should watch Caddicarus's video on PC building. Its a trip
[0:09:04] <%KetsuoTaberu> Fair
[0:09:04] <andre11dr> This is EAs fault
[0:09:04] <dds333a> It is, in a lot of ways, but yeah, the solo pc experience has issues
[0:09:05] <tacostarvedbeast> doing qa for pc games sounds like a nightmare
[0:09:05] <SomersaultJustice> what did I miss?
[0:09:06] <+b_aleph> BASED
[0:09:06] <%Exiliator> Yeah it is
[0:09:08] <+Zanzibar_Junker> totally
[0:09:09] <%Juriasu> sponsorship at risk monkaS
[0:09:09] <derap41> Ain't Worth Origin
[0:09:12] <Solidnick18> idk
[0:09:13] <@Solidus_113> yeah, the noise is so faint that it'll be drowned out by everything else
[0:09:15] <%ChoculaUltra> wait till Woolie finds out EA is making another game launcher called EA Play on top of Origin LUL
[0:09:18] <JdotSweapA> its the trade off for purchasing an EA game. platform be damned
[0:09:19] <majindusto> JUST PLAY CONSOLE
[0:09:20] <leith_aziz> For comftorable play. It SHOULD be good
[0:09:20] <%X2Eliah> All this after buying a graphics card for like 2k usd
[0:09:23] <brachydios777> Master race?
[0:09:24] <+glgzephyr> Nah, this is the exception as opposed to the rule
[0:09:27] <%johnny_gogo> its a stuggle that can be blamed on the publishers
[0:09:27] <%KetsuoTaberu> @ChoculaUltra NotLikeThis
[0:09:28] <leith_aziz> Come on. We're PC players here
[0:09:32] <dds333a> PC is being held back by others
[0:09:33] <SomersaultJustice> play Mario 35 before it dies tomorrow
[0:09:35] <andre11dr> And you have the best PC too so you can't blame it on that
[0:09:37] <OldManDeckardCain> pc "master race" that is always forced to fix their games themselves LUL
[0:09:44] <+ja07sj> Just tuned in, did we run into an issue with It Takes Two?
[0:09:51] <+Kitrane> Running Metro Exodus with RTX on PC? Silent as a log. It takes two though? Ready for takeoff.

[0:12:04] <lord_campbell96> Just fight reggie in hand to hand combat
[0:12:06] <puluxor> Is the game's framerate uncapped?
[0:12:06] <DatAsuna> I reckon behind game audio it probably wouldn't be too noticable
[0:12:07] <ergulor> go for it
[0:12:09] <+aishman> "It Takes Two" more like TAKE THREE
[0:12:10] <%X2Eliah> It's bearable for like one stream but not for a full LP
[0:12:10] <majindusto> CONSOLE IT
[0:12:11] <+blink289> It just blends in with my tinnitus anyway
[0:12:11] <%Noonoox12> @WoolieVersus I can't even hear it, so the game volume with likely just drown it out
[0:12:13] <+Mrbaconator> console
[0:12:16] <@Solidus_113> PS4 version will make your fans run louder than PC
[0:12:17] <%HeroToxiko> chaotic binural audio skyhOK

[0:12:37] <brachydios777> How many gb is this game?
[0:12:38] <+Kitrane> The sounds it makes make me legitimately wonder if EA snuck some Phishing programs and such into the game files.
[0:12:39] <%ekodrop> yeah it stopped
[0:12:39] <EvanDude47> ps4 versio. is the worst version apparently
[0:12:39] <JdotSweapA> do more capcom fighting jam instead!

[0:14:39] <zanzibarian_hamster> It still makes me a little sad that EA is puppeting around the name Origin for their store, as if bankrupting and acquiring them wasn't bad enough
[0:14:43] <Darren716> The fuck? How's it so big?
[0:14:44] <+KOD_LAMASI> "It seems pretty big"

[0:15:01] <+SuperKirby24> LUL

[0:18:33] <ronin19xx> These questions man
[0:18:34] <@Solidus_113> steam cloud
[0:18:35] <%justcallmebobplease> I'm sure he'd understand that you like his game so much you used it to fill a tech foible moment - that just demonstrates how fun the game is for quick pickup.
[0:18:36] <ronin19xx> Risky

[0:18:59] <@Menitta> Tekken Advance lets go
[0:19:01] <+HefestoForges> time to hex edit saves
[0:19:06] <unthought> Get It Takes Two Fighting Games (FOR TIME)
[0:19:16] <+RealPT1> You have to check if the game is cloud supported or not
[0:19:16] <RyuuAoi> Tuesday Night Tussles?
[0:19:18] <%justcallmebobplease> @DatAsuna you beaten Strikers yet? I was feeling myself and started NG+ on Merciless... I was not ready.
[0:19:19] <@Solidus_113> Souls games are the only ones I know don't have cloud saves
[0:19:25] <+RealPT1> it's game dependent
[0:19:27] <%X2Eliah> Steam cloud has a savegame upload speed of like 20 kbps
[0:19:29] <%Solarint> Solarint converted from a Prime sub to a Tier 1 sub!
[0:19:29] <%Solarint> Solarint converted from a Prime sub to a Tier 1 sub!
[0:19:30] <Tracazoid> Steam Cloud at one point after beating MKX's story would revert me back to a fresh save. Did it 4 times until I uninstalled it entirely.
[0:19:33] <%nabby1> COUGH* Arkham CIty *cough
[0:19:38] <Darren716> Yeah DS2 was the only time I had a steam not carry over
[0:19:45] <+RyTYoung> Woolie will figure it out as he do Kappa
[0:19:49] <+blink289> that wine
[0:19:49] <brachydios777> I am honestly surprised by how big this game is
[0:19:50] <+HefestoForges> reggie is in the game!
[0:19:51] <SunsetJack> Oh no
[0:19:52] <aiutare47> Whoa what was that

[0:20:00] <+iLike_femboys> reggie is the game
[0:20:01] <dds333a> come on, Cloud
[0:20:01] <Meltgar> Looking at this "experience", has there been any sponsor stream that has been a failure in terms of running the game you are trying to showcase?
[0:20:03] <%X2Eliah> @brachydios777 I thought it was some small indie game
[0:20:03] <andre11dr> WOW that was a big ring
[0:20:12] <SunsetJack> It is gone now
[0:20:14] <%Juriasu> whoa that pop

[0:20:41] <Meltgar> ULTRA WOOLIE
[0:20:42] <%Noonoox12> is there supposed to be sound?

[0:21:11] <leith_aziz> ok
[0:21:12] <dds333a> I don't remember
[0:21:12] <puluxor> I think sometimes games just have their save in a weird place where Steam can't grab it, so Steam Cloud only copies a setting files or something from the Steam install folder
[0:21:18] <andre11dr> I don't remember
[0:21:21] <RyuuAoi> Complete
[0:21:30] <qohq> there is no sound

[0:25:52] <%X2Eliah> Ultrakill might be one of those games that mad hard to jump into after a while
[0:25:52] <@Menitta> I am here to watch whatever is played.
[0:25:54] <+Reverend_Roscoe> wait they beat it? when?
[0:26:02] <Lancaster_H> oh right, controller aiming LUL
[0:26:08] <Clundy> Oh boy, time to relearn controls
[0:26:10] <andre11dr> This is why i don't have a program except for waking up at least at 11 am
[0:26:14] <%X2Eliah> ontroller aiming, kayboard walking?
[0:26:15] <%Javaa01> Javaa01 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months! Woolie, one possible solution to the buzz is probably to just go to the Nvidia Control Panel and cap the framerate to like 150fps, since I think your GPU was running uncapped in that menu and pulling enough power to cause EM interference from power draw
[0:26:19] <%Consumanist> how to play game: just hit button

[0:27:23] <PMda2nd> it takes two days
[0:27:24] <+SuperKirby24> LUL
[0:27:27] <%ekodrop> deep breath
[0:27:28] <andre11dr> Let be confusing
[0:27:30] <%DomPressesButtons> technology is a fuck
[0:27:33] <dds333a> I'm more onboard with UK than ITT, only because I don't know what ITT is
[0:27:33] <%ZweihanderSteve> life of a streamer. take your time D:
[0:27:34] <Visorak6> It's a pretty safe blame tbh
[0:27:35] <+shiplord13> Reggie give Woolie a hug
[0:27:37] <ronin19xx> I blame EA
[0:27:37] <+samuraiknack> Run some sets Woolie
[0:27:39] <DracOmega64> So no It Takes Two?
[0:27:42] <T_Sasquatch> I still don't know what buzz people are talking about
[0:27:42] <+ja07sj> F the OSCARS SwiftRage
[0:27:44] <majindusto> ALWAYS BLAME EA
[0:27:44] <ronin19xx> Andf trahs optimization
[0:27:45] <%Consumanist> this feels alot like my parents divorce
[0:27:47] <%Solarint> take your time, I aint going anywhere and tech is a pain in the ass 90% of the time
[0:27:48] <%X2Eliah> It's Ok Woolz we all blame origin xD
[0:27:50] <KidKaiser23> Wow, It Takes Two really has different levels
[0:27:50] <%MajorCrasher> I'LL NEVER FORGIVE THE OSCARS
[0:27:51] <WanderingYoren> Remember when Fares Fares was on Westworld and Chernobyl?
[0:27:53] <%Noonoox12> woolieMIRIN woolieKICKDAD hug time
[0:27:55] <KidKaiser23> Such a diverse game
[0:27:57] <%Solarint> QUAKE PRO FOV
[0:27:58] <+ja07sj> oh my god this FoV
[0:28:00] <+iLike_femboys> this is the first stream i saw that had this kind of troubles while playing it takes two
[0:28:03] <Dao_Puppy> What does Origin have to do with the game itself being intensive?
[0:28:11] <unthought> To understand a problem, you have to look to the Origin
[0:28:11] <+ja07sj> we FISHEYEZ now
[0:28:12] <jorniev> why does it say it akes two?
[0:28:17] <andre11dr> Yeah why is the FOV like that?
[0:28:17] <JetpackMcQuack> 90s FOV
[0:28:18] <SomeOtherNeb> yooo Woolie x Ultrakill? Awesome
[0:28:20] <+HefestoForges> oh boy he gonna get booted into the air
[0:28:21] <Visorak6> slide
[0:28:27] <dds333a> the last time I had to troubleshoot stuff like this was setting up an emulator
[0:28:27] <%MajorCrasher> slide
[0:28:28] <Lancaster_H> is he on 110 fov
[0:28:29] <%X2Eliah> @andre11dr Pro FPS gameplay
[0:28:31] <Potatoidea> Can't believe the talking book made a couple play an indie FPS to save their marriage
[0:28:31] <zanzibarian_hamster> sliiiiiide
[0:28:32] <@Menitta> you are s p e e d
[0:28:42] <JetpackMcQuack> I need to see who‚Äôs behind me
[0:28:44] <Visorak6> Mouse sensitivity is what you're after
[0:28:48] <%Noonoox12> THE FOV GOES HIGHER!?
[0:28:49] <%Solarint> I remember hybrid
[0:28:51] <Visorak6> Controller is supported its just not labeled
[0:28:52] <+HefestoForges> fov to 90 so we don't die of motion sickness
[0:28:53] <%Noonoox12> @WoolieVersus you were full controller
[0:28:55] <%X2Eliah> no idea
[0:28:59] <majindusto> THE HYBRID
[0:29:01] <PMda2nd> @jorniev was planned to be played, tech issues occured. so they're playing this now
[0:29:02] <majindusto> enigmaKEK
[0:29:03] <Lancaster_H> woolie you should really lower the fov to 90 @WoolieVersus
[0:29:05] <ronin19xx> Oh wow this isnt even full FOV
[0:29:11] <brachydios777> Rocket fist acquired
[0:29:12] <sendart> break out the cube
[0:29:14] <+StooEsq> Hybrid Heaven
[0:29:17] <%justcallmebobplease> YES IT DID
[0:29:18] <%Solarint> was it not? its been a while
[0:29:19] <%X2Eliah> xD
[0:29:21] <%Solarint> my bad
[0:29:31] <%X2Eliah> @Solarint Could be either or tbh
[0:29:39] <%justcallmebobplease> That was a whole thing for you to find out, last time - mouse sensitivity = joystick sensitivity
[0:29:44] <%X2Eliah> I kinda remember Woolz trying several controller combos at start
[0:29:53] <exnuart> someone get Hakita in here to roast this man on controller play
[0:29:54] <andre11dr> Now will Woolie remember too shoot the coins?
[0:29:57] <+HefestoForges> and super jump after slam
[0:30:10] <Visorak6> Bring near enemies when you shoot/melee them gives regen
[0:30:11] <SunsetJack> Slam takes 2 charges I think?
[0:30:17] <andre11dr> And punch shotgun shells
[0:30:18] <%Consumanist> The mouse speed is tide to Whoolies patience
[0:30:30] <%Solarint> @X2Eliah yeah, perhaps thats what I'm remembering, he was trying to find what works best for him.
[0:30:34] <SunsetJack> Punch is your parry.
[0:30:35] <+HefestoForges> you unequipped your guns?
[0:30:37] <andre11dr> Also charge the shotgun
[0:30:38] <exnuart> punch yout shotgun
[0:30:41] <brachydios777> Anyone seen the KinoFabino Ultra kill videos?
[0:30:41] <+ClericOfSparda> Why not just start a new game?
[0:30:42] <Visorak6> Yeah you need to re-equip your guns looks like?
[0:30:44] <%X2Eliah> Tbh it's gonna be fine, this is just a point and click game really
[0:30:48] <@Menitta> Oh yeah this game
[0:30:49] <exnuart> unequipped
[0:30:49] <steelstwitchaccount> Revolver Ocelot
[0:30:51] <%Javaa01> Click Equip
[0:30:57] <+HefestoForges> equip the guns wools
[0:31:00] <%Javaa01> Where it says "unequipped"
[0:31:00] <@Menitta> where you punch bullets to explode
[0:31:06] <dds333a> A really FAST point and click
[0:31:07] <SunsetJack> Yea, just redo the first level
[0:31:14] <%Javaa01> You can take EVERTHING
[0:31:15] <+HefestoForges> no you can take everything

[0:31:44] <exnuart> boomer shooter rules
[0:31:44] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:31:44] <%Noonoox12> @WoolieVersus Core Eject has you launch a grenade occasionally. You can overcharge it
[0:31:45] <dds333a> strapping all the guns to your robo wings
[0:31:45] <%HollowedIdjit> o we back
[0:31:52] <%Javaa01> You unequipped yourself at the end of the original Ultrakill stream @WoolieVersus
[0:31:53] <DeliveryPig> Heads up you still have "it takes two" under the game title
[0:31:54] <@Solidus_113> one's an explosive shot the other's a charge pump
[0:31:57] <andre11dr> It sure will
[0:32:02] <+HefestoForges> remember you got a red arm too
[0:32:02] <steelstwitchaccount> #acclimated
[0:32:03] <brachydios777> ‚ÄúI need guns, lots of guns‚Äù
[0:32:08] <Visorak6> Remember that you switch between guns AND styles
[0:32:15] <Visorak6> And you have the big O arm
[0:32:18] <+HefestoForges> @WoolieVersus don't forget your alternate arm, the shotgun arm
[0:32:19] <exnuart> you can dash through your explosive pumps
[0:32:20] <%X2Eliah> Eeeeh eff it do it raw
[0:32:29] <andre11dr> But this way we get too see it all
[0:32:29] <RyuuAoi> HIT TAKE TONITE
[0:32:34] <RyuuAoi> Hot
[0:32:47] <Visorak6> You gotta switch your arm between parry arm and shotgun arm
[0:32:51] <dds333a> yeah, but now it's impromptu
[0:32:53] <EternalJedi> and multiple mine thigns to chain the swarm
[0:32:59] <andre11dr> You can punch the shotgun
[0:33:01] <RyuuAoi> You didn't flag me @moobot good boy NotLikeThis
[0:33:05] <brachydios777> Doesn‚Äôt Woolie have rocket fist after V2 now?
[0:33:10] <Clundy> punch all the bullets
[0:33:16] <andre11dr> I think the other one
[0:33:20] <%Javaa01> Regular shot and punch
[0:33:21] <exnuart> bullet punch timing is really tight
[0:33:24] <+HefestoForges> just shoot and punch
[0:33:26] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Regular Shot
[0:33:28] <@Solidus_113> not the alt fire
[0:33:30] <+glgzephyr> man, I love the way guns feel in this game
[0:33:34] <Visorak6> That will blow you up
[0:33:38] <gryffinp> You wanna plink from primary fire to melee
[0:33:38] <+HefestoForges> just switch
[0:33:40] <%Noonoox12> @WoolieVersus you have to back dodge during it
[0:33:41] <exnuart> can dash through
[0:33:46] <+StooEsq> but do it, tho
[0:33:46] <%Javaa01> Dash back
[0:33:47] <Visorak6> Backdash
[0:33:47] <Potatoidea> Nice beat
[0:33:56] <Jaysky> That noise is great
[0:33:59] <andre11dr> Yeah you can dash it
[0:34:01] <+b_aleph> Is this from the beginning or from when he's stopped?
[0:34:02] <+HefestoForges> you can do it forwards
[0:34:06] <+HefestoForges> just get the right iframes
[0:34:07] <exnuart> dash has I frames
[0:34:09] <Clundy> You can shoot down for a rocket jump
[0:34:14] <RyuuAoi> Wait...why are we not playing Goldeneye 007 right now?
[0:34:19] <@Solidus_113> practice needed

[0:35:16] <@Solidus_113> couldn't just deal with the fan noise
[0:35:19] <EternalJedi> @WoolieVersus Disco ELysium seems to be unlocking says people?
[0:35:19] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Practice in the Cyber Grind
[0:35:20] <Clundy> Understandable Woolie, play what you feel comfortable with
[0:35:23] <%lostcolors> oh yeah disco is today
[0:35:26] <%MajorCrasher> is it takes two still downloading?
[0:35:27] <%Javaa01> @WoolieVersus Do a test run in Cybergrind at the store terminal
[0:35:37] <brachydios777> What is this gonna look like on YouTube?
[0:35:38] <gryffinp> there we go
[0:35:40] <andre11dr> Oh i actually need to get Disco ,thanks for reminding me
[0:35:43] <Visorak6> Pump charger
[0:35:48] <DatAsuna> I love the sound fx on it
[0:35:52] <exnuart> cybergrind practice will give you gun points
[0:35:59] <exnuart> also the song is a bop
[0:36:14] <@Solidus_113> you only have to dash on max charge
[0:36:15] <+HefestoForges> playing with fire
[0:36:17] <Visorak6> There you go
[0:36:22] <brachydios777> Did it
[0:36:23] <PrideOfFiddles> Nice
[0:36:23] <%Solarint> that overcharge alarm is soooo good
[0:36:36] <jorniev> SO EXTRA
[0:36:39] <andre11dr> Isn't there a training mode?
[0:36:42] <brachydios777> Coin flip
[0:36:44] <%justcallmebobplease> Coin tricking with the pistol
[0:36:44] <%X2Eliah> Pistol was the coin thing?
[0:36:49] <gryffinp> Not exactly but there's a horde mode
[0:36:53] <%Javaa01> @andre11dr Yeah, Cybergrind
[0:37:01] <+ja07sj> why not just replay the prologue...?
[0:37:05] <Visorak6> You can wall-cling and walljump too
[0:37:16] <jorniev> BACK INTO THE LAB AGAIN
[0:37:17] <%AlteisenReiseZ> You can punch the coin too
[0:37:17] <exnuart> sliding is momentum, and multiplier
[0:37:18] <UnfilteredComic> Keeps your combo going, like grinding in TonyHawk
[0:37:29] <dds333a> yeah, this one is stylish
[0:37:30] <+HefestoForges> coins are easy if you don't look to the sides
[0:37:31] <gryffinp> well the problem is it's near impossible to do the coin thing when auto-aim is on
[0:37:40] <andre11dr> You Eron Black that shit and it's a one shot kill
[0:37:52] <+RealPT1> slide is just movement and lowering your hurtbox
[0:37:55] <Clundy> If you hit the coin it auto crits a weak point on the closest enemy
[0:37:59] <jorniev> sliding gives you speed and carries momentum... i think
[0:38:05] <+glgzephyr> @WoolieVersus Disco Elysium is live
[0:38:09] <brachydios777> Why does a robot have coins?
[0:38:10] <%Javaa01> Nailgun, you don't have the Railgun yet
[0:38:30] <exnuart> @Javaa01 he stopped after the V2 fight

[0:40:38] <+RealPT1> got the wrong arm on
[0:40:44] <+HefestoForges> change arm tho
[0:40:46] <X2Eliah> @gryffinp "keyboard" is a forbidden swear word in the Woolie houshold
[0:40:47] <bonebagMEL> is this the train level or the big guy level?
[0:40:50] <%Javaa01> G to swap arms
[0:40:53] <Clundy> Hold punch
[0:40:54] <+HefestoForges> CHANGE ARM
[0:40:57] <exnuart> arm swap
[0:41:01] <andre11dr> You didn't get it

[0:41:23] <exnuart> blue
[0:41:32] <+FuqBoiSlim> Mouse and keyboard? More like "Louse and CHEATboard"
[0:41:33] <+HefestoForges> now change arms
[0:41:37] <Detectivemac9> there's a switch arm button but I have no idea what it is
[0:41:40] <gryffinp> there's a button to arm swap and we have no idea what it is on controller
[0:41:40] <bonebagMEL> this is going to be hard to watch
[0:41:42] <+HefestoForges> find the button
[0:41:43] <%X2Eliah> @FuqBoiSlim damn
[0:41:43] <Clundy> Switch weapon on fist to switch arms maybe?
[0:41:43] <brachydios777> G?
[0:41:44] <Visorak6> There's a button for it
[0:41:52] <bonebagMEL> press all the buttons
[0:41:56] <exnuart> G on kb, idk controller
[0:41:58] <+glgzephyr> imagine using a controller to play Ultrakill LUL LUL LUL
[0:42:03] <andre11dr> There should be a button
[0:42:07] <Detectivemac9> click the sticks???
[0:42:12] <exnuart> click the sticks maybe?
[0:42:13] <Visorak6> Is there one you havent pressed yet?
[0:42:19] <%X2Eliah> Controllers don't have that many buttons y'all
[0:42:22] <andre11dr> Just mash it all
[0:42:23] <+glgzephyr> oh that's not bad
[0:42:27] <Detectivemac9> you had it what'd you hit
[0:42:28] <Lancaster_H> imaging playing games with their intended control schemes
[0:42:39] <brachydios777> Dpad , figures
[0:42:40] <EternalJedi> ALRIGHT
[0:42:42] <Visorak6> Remember no more parrying with that arm
[0:42:44] <EternalJedi> PAUUUNCH
[0:42:45] <Clundy> Dpad makes sense
[0:42:45] <+glgzephyr> GET OFF ME
[0:42:47] <%Noonoox12> RELOAD YOUR FIST
[0:42:47] <andre11dr> Well his on a couch
[0:42:50] <+glgzephyr> it's a shine
[0:42:54] <bonebagMEL> It does little damage
[0:42:58] <%X2Eliah> Man who even invented dpads
[0:42:59] <%Javaa01> aaaAAAaaaaa
[0:43:02] <EternalJedi> limesD ahhhhhhhhh\
[0:43:03] <+HefestoForges> LUL
[0:43:07] <brachydios777> What was that about damage Woolie?
[0:43:08] <dds333a> AAAHHHHH
[0:43:09] <exnuart> blue to parry
[0:43:10] <+HefestoForges> no you can't
[0:43:13] <exnuart> red cant parry
[0:43:13] <gryffinp> you CANNOT punch boost the shotgun with the knuckleblaster.
[0:43:13] <+HefestoForges> blue does it
[0:43:15] <sir_nack> @WoolieVersus red arm cannot parry
[0:43:19] <+glgzephyr> SAVED IT
[0:43:20] <bonebagMEL> RED ARM doesn't parry

[0:43:25] <Visorak6> No parrying, nope
[0:43:26] <%Noonoox12> @WoolieVersus blue arm for parry

[0:43:29] <%Javaa01> You can't parry shots with this arm like with the blue arm
[0:43:32] <+glgzephyr> @Celarious YOU KNOW IT
[0:43:32] <bonebagMEL> so it RED ARM doesn't do bomb shot
[0:43:33] <gryffinp> you CAN use the knuckleblaster to acellerate a coin by a billion mph
[0:43:41] <%HeroToxiko> got those H Cavill15's
[0:43:42] <+HefestoForges> fire and punch
[0:43:42] <exnuart> the moment the shotgun goes up
[0:43:47] <+glgzephyr> LUL
[0:43:56] <brachydios777> Blue= parry, Red=knockback
[0:43:58] <+glgzephyr> what a great death screen
[0:44:00] <exnuart> its a really tight window
[0:44:05] <bonebagMEL> bombshotgun timing is 1,2 real quick. not same time
[0:44:06] <%X2Eliah> "What is 'R' on controller?"
[0:44:19] <Meltgar> @X2Eliah Probably you gotta set it p
[0:44:22] <Meltgar> *up
[0:44:23] <%Javaa01> Red doesn't parry
[0:44:24] <Detectivemac9> blue is pretty strictly for parrying, red arm is for causing knockback and actually doing damage with punches themselves
[0:44:25] <+HefestoForges> the feedbacker is the blue arm LUL
[0:44:40] <+glgzephyr> oh my god
[0:44:44] <bonebagMEL> This is going to be rough to get back into
[0:44:47] <+HefestoForges> LUL
[0:44:48] <bonebagMEL> but fun, as always
[0:44:49] <Meltgar> DEAD
[0:44:50] <gryffinp> he almost had it
[0:44:51] <jorniev> WHAT IS THAT ARM!?
[0:44:54] <Visorak6> You'll get used to it
[0:44:54] <Lancaster_H> are you feelin it now mr krabs
[0:44:55] <+ja07sj> "Guilty Gear Strive will be available to play early for all who preordered the game (Ultimate & Deluxe Editions) on June 8, 2021."
[0:44:55] <%BestTeaMaker> ha. ha. ha.
[0:44:55] <+FuqBoiSlim> We back in
[0:44:57] <%Solarint> LUL
[0:44:59] <+HefestoForges> ha
[0:44:59] <%Solarint> this game is so wild
[0:45:00] <%MajorCrasher> ha
[0:45:04] <+ja07sj> "Steam players will unfortunately have to wait to play the game until the actual release on June 25, 2021."
[0:45:04] <dds333a> HA
[0:45:04] <%ThisIsLloyd> cuk. cuk. cuk. cuk
[0:45:10] <%HeroToxiko> Super Shot
[0:45:14] <sir_nack> playing ultrakill with a controller seems like it would be really awkward
[0:45:16] <%ThisIsLloyd> its all i can hear
[0:45:20] <+glgzephyr> oh wow
[0:45:25] <%X2Eliah> wooow
[0:45:30] <+HefestoForges> this level is all about death pits tho
[0:45:33] <Detectivemac9> shmovin
[0:45:35] <bonebagMEL> I highly suggest playing from the start of the game to get back into the groove. Or play the cybergrind (bloody palace) for a little bit.
[0:45:37] <+HefestoForges> woolie is fucked LUL
[0:45:46] <dds333a> Important
[0:45:47] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:45:47] <Detectivemac9> you get three wallkicks
[0:45:50] <Visorak6> 3 wallbounces
[0:45:55] <+glgzephyr> dude, I sometimes play FPS games with controllers, but I would not TOUCH this one with it
[0:46:09] <+HefestoForges> aim and move at the same time wools
[0:46:10] <+ja07sj> yeah like a halo or a cod is fine
[0:46:22] <Meltgar> @ja07sj Wouldn't that be mostly "Console" players who preordered? Thought i was fine since i ordered Ultimate edition, but until you sent the other message
[0:46:26] <+HefestoForges> oh boi
[0:46:32] <Detectivemac9> i mean he got this far with a controller so he'll make it, but yeah I probably wouldn't myself haha
[0:46:32] <jorniev> remember the butt stump
[0:46:36] <dds333a> watch your feet
[0:46:38] <gryffinp> the best part is that this is the platforming level
[0:46:41] <+glgzephyr> wait you get style points for friendly fire? LUL
[0:46:41] <jorniev> butt stomp
[0:46:42] <%X2Eliah> Why play EASY games made for BABIES when you can play HARDCORE games made for BIG MANLY MEN?
[0:46:46] <%hax_metatron> What happened to It Takes Two?
[0:46:53] <sir_nack> i mostly just wanna see him fight [act 1 boss spoiler]
[0:47:00] <exnuart> oh he doesn't even know how rough this shit is about to get
[0:47:00] <Meltgar> But woolie, you played CoD and titanfall, you can easily play FPS now Kappa
[0:47:02] <PMda2nd> welcome back
[0:47:03] <%Javaa01> @glgzephyr It's for killing an enemy with another enemy
[0:47:05] <brachydios777> @hax_metatron Origin happened
[0:47:05] <+HefestoForges> checkpoint reggie
[0:47:06] <Visorak6> checkpoint reggie
[0:47:07] <Clundy> @hax_metatron Origin and the game were causing problems
[0:47:10] <andre11dr> It's fine, i like it rough
[0:47:12] <+glgzephyr> ah gotcha
[0:47:25] <+HefestoForges> the aim LUL
[0:47:25] <+FuqBoiSlim> woolie dashing around reminds me of all those dmc4 combo vids where have the runtime and dante dashing everywhere absolutely nothing
[0:47:35] <sir_nack> god this level is gonna be such a pain in the ass on controller
[0:47:42] <+glgzephyr> he's not aiming with the right stick at all.....
[0:47:54] <+HefestoForges> and WELCOME
[0:47:55] <bonebagMEL> This is the platformer bridge level right?
[0:47:59] <Lancaster_H> given the chance woolie would play starcraft on a controller
[0:47:59] <bonebagMEL> yep
[0:48:01] <brachydios777> Whoa
[0:48:01] <+HefestoForges> now the level starts
[0:48:02] <+ja07sj> @Meltgar yeah console players with deluxe or ultimate get it on June 8th
[0:48:05] <+FuqBoiSlim> That's a sonic adventure ass skybox
[0:48:05] <+HefestoForges> RIP
[0:48:05] <dds333a> here we go
[0:48:08] <%Solarint> my god, this part to come back to
[0:48:08] <%X2Eliah> @glgzephyr "ai.....ming......?"
[0:48:14] <PMda2nd> huh
[0:48:15] <%cobalt_phoenix_> SourPls
[0:48:23] <%Solarint> this game goes fucking balls to the wall right when woolie set it down
[0:48:26] <brachydios777> Pretty level
[0:48:33] <+jamaicanbarber> RIP bitrate
[0:48:39] <bonebagMEL> I think you guys should enable aim-assist
[0:48:45] <+asgard147> Kill them all Woolie limesEvil
[0:48:46] <+HefestoForges> @WoolieVersus you might have come back at the most difficult stage for controller setups
[0:48:47] <bonebagMEL> seems to be disabled
[0:48:48] <MihajloMBlood> Wait a minute! This ain't Yakoozies 0
[0:48:58] <gryffinp> damn, i was hoping no one would remind him that he got through the first two levels with auto-aim on
[0:49:04] <dds333a> Good shot on going over the head, tho
[0:49:07] <brachydios777> @mihajlomblood Wednesdays
[0:49:15] <andre11dr> I like how Woolie jumped in right when the game GOES IN LUL
[0:49:17] <dds333a> or rather, the projectile
[0:49:18] <MihajloMBlood> I know, I'm just extremely impatient @brachydios777
[0:49:18] <bonebagMEL> I mean... he needs all the help he can get if he wants to enjoy this game
[0:49:23] <%X2Eliah> @MihajloMBlood that would be tomorrow, and tbh woolie is putting yak0 on indefinite break
[0:49:25] <%Solarint> awwwwwwww
[0:49:27] <%Solarint> so close
[0:49:27] <+HefestoForges> no you can get it
[0:49:43] <+HefestoForges> woolie there are boosters down there, fall on them if you get off
[0:49:45] <MihajloMBlood> Yeah, but like I said, I am very impatient LUL
[0:49:56] <dds333a> Hey Ya
[0:49:56] <Visorak6> Might want to get used to the shotgun again so you're close enough to enemies to get healing?
[0:49:58] <+HefestoForges> HOW
[0:50:10] <sir_nack> my dude you gotta be switching weapons way more than you are
[0:50:17] <Otatoptohami> so does this game have terrible controller optimization or is woolie's aim terrible?
[0:50:23] <%X2Eliah> LUL
[0:50:26] <SixthShinx> LUL
[0:50:32] <dds333a> KEKW
[0:50:35] <+Jiggisnipe> both probably
[0:50:35] <%Noonoox12> @Otatoptohami both? both,
[0:50:36] <brachydios777> Vertically heaven
[0:50:43] <%X2Eliah> @Otatoptohami uh... yes?
[0:50:50] <+HefestoForges> think of the weapons as stances in Nioh, you gotta change it to actually do shit
[0:50:52] <brachydios777> *Verticality
[0:51:05] <gryffinp> I think this is also the first point in the game where any kind of fall isn't insta-death
[0:51:10] <gryffinp> its actually pretty merciful, really
[0:51:14] <+Jiggisnipe> I think the devs came to Pat's stream and gave him shit for using a controller
[0:51:21] <andre11dr> Does Woolie remember that blood heals?
[0:51:23] <+FuqBoiSlim> ULTRAAAAAAAA
[0:51:25] <PrideOfFiddles> Ultraaaaaa!
[0:51:31] <dds333a> Mow em down
[0:51:35] <+HefestoForges> statue time
[0:51:35] <%X2Eliah> See Woolz is doing fine
[0:51:35] <brachydios777> Rocket fist seems pretty good with ledges around
[0:51:39] <+HefestoForges> GET PUNTED
[0:51:42] <@Menitta> You have done the UltraKill
[0:51:55] <+HefestoForges> get the point
[0:51:57] <BlackermanZX> oh cool ultrakill
[0:51:58] <+HefestoForges> it is
[0:52:07] <gryffinp> @brachydios777 ain't no coincidence that this is the first level after you get the explosion punch.
[0:52:08] <+HefestoForges> LUL
[0:52:09] <bonebagMEL> In hard that thing comes alive
[0:52:10] <+HefestoForges> that was not it
[0:52:13] <+YabbaTroll> nyet!
[0:52:14] <jorniev> A BOSS
[0:52:14] <Otatoptohami> lol
[0:52:21] <sir_nack> he didnt do it lol
[0:52:35] <+HefestoForges> @WoolieVersus dash first, then jump. You didn't do it
[0:52:36] <jorniev> wait
[0:52:50] <dds333a> That's the MO
[0:52:50] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:53:00] <+HefestoForges> what you aiming at!
[0:53:02] <bonebagMEL> THis isn't supposed to be this stressful lol
[0:53:05] <+HefestoForges> LUL
[0:53:12] <jorniev> DASH then jump? like 1 2 with the shotgun punch?
[0:53:17] <+HefestoForges> yeah
[0:53:17] <%X2Eliah> So not gonna lie It Takes Two looks like a very fun game but reggie isn't doing much playing
[0:53:22] <bonebagMEL> @jorniev Exactly
[0:53:36] <+YabbaTroll> heh
[0:53:36] <+RealThiele> all you need is kill
[0:53:40] <+HefestoForges> it throws you forward really fast
[0:53:43] <gryffinp> @X2Eliah As metaphors for divorce go, this is stunningly accurate.
[0:53:49] <+ja07sj> I wonder if Woolie would like CRUELTY SQUAD
[0:53:54] <iambqb> Skipped out during the tech issues, they in full pivot, or just waiting for the download to finish?
[0:53:55] <andre11dr> @x2eliah I know, his really letting Woolie down
[0:53:56] <Lancaster_H> are you feeling it now mr krabs
[0:53:56] <brachydios777> Ha.ha.ha.ha.ha.ha
[0:53:57] <+FuqBoiSlim> Don't worry guys. Woolie will figure it out :)
[0:54:05] <+HefestoForges> do the dash jump for real wools
[0:54:18] <gryffinp> big recovery
[0:54:22] <bonebagMEL> I actually like that you DONT need to do the dash jump.
[0:54:24] <+FuqBoiSlim> @iambqb Origin makes the pc sound like LAX so he gave up on that
[0:54:26] <Lefteron> @WoolieVersus Reggie vs Darksouls when?
[0:54:26] <%X2Eliah> @iambqb big pivot
[0:54:34] <+HefestoForges> it is good to know tho
[0:54:43] <+RealThiele> LUL
[0:54:47] <brachydios777> Woolie
[0:54:47] <Josef_Stryker> What happened? Why they playing Ultrakill?
[0:55:03] <+HefestoForges> origin fucked up
[0:55:05] <brachydios777> @josef_stryker Origin is a fuck
[0:55:08] <andre11dr> It Takes Two didn't work because EA
[0:55:15] <Josef_Stryker> Well fuck EA
[0:55:18] <%X2Eliah> @Josef_Stryker The intended game made Woolies' PC fans spin so loud they sounded like a mosquito/bee in the audio
[0:55:47] <bamboostick4> !uptime
[0:55:47] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 55 minutes and 58 seconds
[0:55:47] <+FuqBoiSlim> EA assassinates another stuido. R.I.P BibleThump
[0:55:48] <%X2Eliah> All probably because Origin was mining bitcoin on his computer
[0:55:53] <+b_aleph> It takes two minigun barrels
[0:56:11] <brachydios777> This gun is like shooting bees
[0:56:16] <+HefestoForges> LUL
[0:56:19] <%lostcolors> that beeping is horrible
[0:56:21] <jorniev> has woolie used the butt stomp?
[0:56:22] <+YabbaTroll> also is the stream resolution kinda borked for anyone else, not including the ps1 graphics they seem to be playing on?
[0:56:22] <Detectivemac9> the most difficult game of all time (on a controller)
[0:56:23] <+HefestoForges> use the shotgun wools
[0:56:24] <ronin19xx> HA HA HA HA
[0:56:28] <+HefestoForges> it's close quarters
[0:56:28] <outofthemox> ha
[0:56:35] <sir_nack> is he refusing to do the dash jump as a bit
[0:56:46] <+HefestoForges> it's not a bit it's a feature
[0:56:48] <%X2Eliah> @sir_nack hahaha no
[0:56:50] <+funya_rinpa> This game's sound design is something alright
[0:56:51] <Clundy> R O B O M O R T I S
[0:56:57] <Saltmeisterr> YEYE
[0:56:59] <Saltmeisterr> wait
[0:57:12] <+FuqBoiSlim> Woolie is going for the Nail Gun only run any%. Wish him luck guys
[0:57:12] <Saltmeisterr> what happened to it takes two?
[0:57:23] <+Celarious> So how godawful is woolie with a mouse that he insists to play this of all games with a controller
[0:57:26] <%lostcolors> nail gun%
[0:57:36] <slatersev> Did Woolie mention why Yakuza 0 is on hiatus?
[0:57:41] <%X2Eliah> @Celarious It feels more like a principle thing
[0:57:49] <+Jiggisnipe> it's not the mouse, he hates WASD
[0:57:51] <brachydios777> Is it on hiatus?
[0:57:59] <andre11dr> HA HA HA HA
[0:58:00] <ronin19xx> Beamed
[0:58:01] <Visorak6> The mask is just a bullet sponge
[0:58:04] <%X2Eliah> The twitter made it sound like its on hiatus
[0:58:07] <Visorak6> tImmune to explosions
[0:58:07] <Lancaster_H> yeah look at this FINE MOVEMENT that you cant get on wasd Kappa
[0:58:08] <%X2Eliah> but no idea why
[0:58:11] <+HefestoForges> go up to it or parry
[0:58:12] <+b_aleph> @slatersev The Yakuza thretened Lil V
[0:58:12] <Cici_TheMoonRabbit> They are immune to explosives
[0:58:12] <exnuart> pistol
[0:58:14] <dds333a> Woolie has had a categorized history of refusing to use WASD
[0:58:17] <slatersev> the twitter literaly said Hiatus
[0:58:17] <Detectivemac9> the masks are immune to explosions and particularly weak to the nailgun
[0:58:29] <Cici_TheMoonRabbit> Shotgun at point blank messes them up.
[0:58:30] <+HefestoForges> @WoolieVersus you can punch them while they charge to explode them
[0:58:32] <dds333a> He's also averse to mouse due to worries over his wrist
[0:58:40] <+Celarious> Woolie playing on controller so we get more content
[0:58:40] <sir_nack> you can shotgun parry the face when it charges its big laser too
[0:58:42] <%X2Eliah> @Lancaster_H It's not that he just hates pushing the buttons with his fingers
[0:58:50] <Josef_Stryker> So is Woolie just gonna do a full LP of Ultrakill or is this just to kill time?
[0:58:51] <gryffinp> uh
[0:58:52] <Visorak6> Oh right if you punch them when they flash you do tons of damage
[0:59:30] <Lancaster_H> @X2Eliah i know, i just find the movement argument hilarious considering the fine movement of all the twitch shooters on pc
[0:59:33] <%X2Eliah> THis music is pretty good
[0:59:36] <brachydios777> We are like what, half an hour away before downloading finishes?
[0:59:44] <DSD24> This reminds me of that part in DMC3
[0:59:58] <DSD24> The moving squares you gotta jump on
[0:59:58] <+glgzephyr> the game can't be THAT big, right?
[0:59:58] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:00:00] <bonebagMEL> @DSD24 Yeah actually, and DMC4 too.
[1:00:13] <DSD24> Wow!
[1:00:15] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[1:00:18] <+YabbaTroll> LUL
[1:00:18] <Detectivemac9> better tell hakita about that one
[1:00:18] <SixthShinx> OOB LUL
[1:00:19] <%X2Eliah> uh
[1:00:19] <+glgzephyr> it's probably already finished downloading, but Woolie wants to finish the level
[1:00:20] <brachydios777> Ultra Kill is very intentionally DMC
[1:00:21] <outofthemox> speed run strats
[1:00:21] <Visorak6> You clipped through the wall

[1:00:45] <bonebagMEL> not intended but possible
[1:00:47] <gryffinp> the challenge is "don't open doors"
[1:01:10] <@Menitta> Yknow I bet if Woolie was a speedrunner, he would accidentally find bugs that make the game go longer
[1:01:22] <brachydios777> Ultra Kill is if Doom Eternal and DMC had a baby
[1:01:33] <DSD24> I like this nice music
[1:01:34] <Visorak6> This is new
[1:01:34] <gryffinp> yeah that got patched in

[1:01:42] <ronin19xx> Love the store music
[1:01:45] <%justcallmebobplease> Woolie you are shaking rust off SO FAST, don't be so hard on yourself, this is good viewing.
[1:01:46] <Lancaster_H> Rusty is too busy daydrinking
[1:01:53] <+RealThiele> fastfood guy

[1:01:55] <%Solarint> yeah your getting it
[1:01:56] <DSD24> "Welcome to the Circus of Value!"
[1:01:58] <+glgzephyr> this music takes me back
[1:02:15] <gryffinp> this next level is less platformy by far
[1:02:17] <+glgzephyr> @DSD24 Yeah it absolutely is exactly that era
[1:02:21] <@Menitta> oh no Ghostrunner....
[1:02:22] <%X2Eliah> I remember this music in the new york clubs in 1920
[1:02:24] <+Astrobstrd> Jam alert
[1:02:26] <%justcallmebobplease> THESE LEVEL NAMES
[1:02:29] <DSD24> Hard Cut to Techno

[1:02:43] <%X2Eliah> yeyeyeye Mario music!!
[1:02:45] <bonebagMEL> Also this song? top 10 in the game
[1:02:46] <+glgzephyr> @brachydios777 Nah, Jazz band in college
[1:02:46] <Hoanui> Oh, full controller for today?
[1:02:51] <+Astrobstrd> This level's a lot of fun too
[1:02:53] <+EySoyCoco> ratJAM
[1:03:00] <brachydios777> @glgzephyr Ah, that‚Äôs cool
[1:03:04] <@Solidus_113> oh, I watched Hana do this level a while ago
[1:03:09] <andre11dr> I love how hard the vibe changes with these next levels
[1:03:11] <DSD24> Did Woolie get the arm from a boss?
[1:03:11] <+StooEsq> music for the next stage goes in even harder
[1:03:19] <%X2Eliah> @Hoanui Every day
[1:03:26] <+RealThiele> smartgun is never not cool
[1:03:32] <brachydios777> @dsd24 Yee
[1:03:40] <bonebagMEL> Go buy the ultrakill soundtrack on bandcamp, it's great.
[1:03:41] <+HefestoForges> window
[1:04:09] <brachydios777> Who did the soundtrack?
[1:04:13] <DSD24> @brachydios777 Sweet!
[1:04:15] <+blastyoboots> Butt slam the suspicious red square?
[1:04:17] <dds333a> right to the dome
[1:04:24] <Pnutz409> this is craxy
[1:04:38] <+StooEsq> it's not crazy yet
[1:04:40] <+Mrbaconator> MORTIS
[1:04:42] <+FuqBoiSlim> ha ha ha ha
[1:04:43] <sir_nack> you have other weapons my friend
[1:04:44] <gryffinp> @brachydios777 99% is the developer, hakita, the horde mode music was a musician named meganeko
[1:04:46] <+mechslayer71> Yeah this is controller alright
[1:04:47] <brachydios777> @dsd24 V2, red version of the player
[1:04:48] <Visorak6> No its the flash the moment before it fires
[1:04:52] <%X2Eliah> That was a good solid 5 minutes without deaths
[1:04:53] <Visorak6> Youll hear a TINK
[1:04:55] <+HefestoForges> @brachydios777 it was hakita himself, the dev
[1:05:06] <brachydios777> Nice
[1:05:11] <DSD24> @brachydios777 Oh cool a rival character
[1:05:31] <+FuqBoiSlim> Someone said Devin chat?
[1:05:39] <gryffinp> between ultrakill and undertale I've grown convinced that the way to make genuinely incredible indie games is to spend years being a musician first.
[1:05:54] <+HefestoForges> window wools
[1:05:56] <DSD24> Good music elevates things
[1:06:04] <brachydios777> @gryffinp ULTRA TALENT
[1:06:13] <+FuqBoiSlim> soundtrack is like a good 30% of the game's quality. if I'm being real
[1:06:14] <+mechslayer71> Oh god, is woolie just using the I don‚Äôt have to aim gun?
[1:06:24] <DSD24> I mean its effective
[1:06:37] <gryffinp> @mechslayer71 No, he's using the "I never have to let go of the shoot button" gun
[1:06:38] <sir_nack> @mechslayer71 he hasnt switched weapons once
[1:06:47] <brachydios777> Are you saying you would not use the smart gun?
[1:06:57] <dds333a> not always, at least
[1:07:03] <+HefestoForges> LUL
[1:07:03] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1376753284791296000?s=19
[1:07:07] <+mechslayer71> I use it sometimes when I play, but the other guns are too cool to no use
[1:07:09] <DSD24> So is the punch a shotgun or a pile bunker?
[1:07:10] <+Astrobstrd> This isn't even like a slight against him for using controller but it's definitely going to be the best gun to use while using it
[1:07:11] <+mechslayer71> Also style points
[1:07:20] <+FuqBoiSlim> woolie just can't let go of titanfall 2 and will always use the smart gun. I understand his pain
[1:07:28] <+HefestoForges> in the house, wools
[1:07:40] <brachydios777> I would give a leg for Titanfall 3
[1:07:46] <SixthShinx> secrets
[1:07:47] <DSD24> Aww that's sad that skeleton
[1:07:51] <DSD24> He had no head
[1:08:00] <+FuqBoiSlim> so no head?
[1:08:10] <Visorak6> Looking for a door
[1:08:11] <+HefestoForges> follow the cable then
[1:08:11] <brachydios777> *slams phone
[1:08:27] <Lancaster_H> lit af fam
[1:08:44] <andre11dr> keep it lit
[1:09:03] <+HefestoForges> the floor wools
[1:09:18] <+HefestoForges> he was doing it BibleThump
[1:09:27] <exnuart> crusty graphics doing him in
[1:09:31] <gryffinp> whatever, he got there
[1:09:32] <exnuart> need the crisp
[1:09:45] <dds333a> blind woolie strikes agai
[1:09:52] <+Astrobstrd> Time for bitrate
[1:10:03] <+FuqBoiSlim> woolie will figure.... nah I can't use that joke anymore
[1:10:10] <brachydios777> I gotta know who Hell‚Äôs exterior decarator is
[1:10:12] <%Noonoox12> NEVER STOP SHOOTINNNNNGGGGG
[1:10:21] <+HefestoForges> the bitrate just died
[1:10:34] <Visorak6> He's dead jim
[1:10:36] <%Solarint> niiice
[1:10:42] <andre11dr> NEVER STOP GOING IN
[1:10:45] <%Solarint> the rust is being SHED
[1:10:48] <+HefestoForges> LUL
[1:10:50] <+FuqBoiSlim> monkaS
[1:10:52] <DSD24> Oh wow the Tower of Babel
[1:10:54] <Lancaster_H> ha
[1:10:57] <brachydios777> LUL
[1:10:58] <+Astrobstrd> ha
[1:11:00] <dds333a> Welcome
[1:11:12] <gryffinp> woolie recovering like its smash bros
[1:11:35] <brachydios777> Oops
[1:11:44] <exnuart> he goes down then jump straight into the fans
[1:11:51] <Lancaster_H> ha
[1:12:03] <andre11dr> Can't dodge that fall tho
[1:12:05] <+PringlesMcGruff> why not use autoaim ?
[1:12:20] <bonebagMEL> @PringlesMcGruff Sadly reggie hasn't looked into the universe
[1:12:31] <brachydios777> Could always use more dakka
[1:12:34] <Lancaster_H> why use autoaim when the gun autoaims for you
[1:12:58] <+HefestoForges> LUL
[1:12:59] <+picante_papi> LUL
[1:13:00] <%Noonoox12> @WoolieVersus there's an autoaim option in the settings. Might help you on controller
[1:13:08] <+HefestoForges> WutFace
[1:13:16] <+HefestoForges> there he is
[1:13:18] <Lancaster_H> LUL
[1:13:18] <gryffinp> autoain won't solve woolie flinging himself off of ledges
[1:13:22] <DSD24> Woolie loved the Smart Pistol and Legion in Titanfall so this gun fits him well
[1:13:23] <exnuart> pistol works well for picking people off from a distance
[1:13:24] <brachydios777> Woolie why?
[1:13:33] <PrideOfFiddles> It's fine :)

[1:13:35] <+mechslayer71> Not even being an asshole, but having played all my time on MK, if I had to use controller I wouldn‚Äôt even bother playing the game
[1:13:37] <gryffinp> so hey welcome to new gun
[1:13:38] <+HefestoForges> RAILGUN
[1:13:39] <Visorak6> RAILGUN
[1:13:43] <brachydios777> Railgun!?
[1:13:49] <%Solarint> FUCK YEAH
[1:13:49] <dds333a> ARE YOU READY
[1:13:50] <%Solarint> BEST GUN
[1:13:51] <+Astrobstrd> Now the real game begins
[1:13:54] <exnuart> oh they put in a timer for it
[1:13:54] <bonebagMEL> the bfg baby
[1:13:59] <bonebagMEL> the DELETE button
[1:14:01] <%Solarint> its got a cool-down
[1:14:06] <DSD24> Wow that's slow
[1:14:06] <%Solarint> or charge time
[1:14:06] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:14:09] <c60_Jam> This a new Ultrakill update?
[1:14:11] <%Noonoox12> ok that's actually super interesting as a style meter mechanic
[1:14:11] <+RealPT1> Problem Solver
[1:14:13] <exnuart> it pierces
[1:14:16] <+HefestoForges> you have to learn how to style switch wools
[1:14:19] <andre11dr> So how do you like your Gauscanon Woolie?
[1:14:24] <gryffinp> @c60_Jam no, he's just going through the rest of the game that was in when he played it
[1:14:25] <bonebagMEL> Yes, you have hit those
[1:14:26] <Visorak6> Its a unreal tournament style railgun
[1:14:28] <+HefestoForges> wtf was that LUL
[1:14:38] <%X2Eliah> Woolie hasn't playd tournament
[1:14:38] <c60_Jam> @gryffinp, Ah cool
[1:14:41] <dds333a> You have to hit them woolie
[1:14:44] <Visorak6> Big lightning bolt icon on the hud @WoolieVersus
[1:14:47] <+Celarious> It's the DIE button that can be configured for your choice of destruction
[1:14:47] <brachydios777> I love the loading is very fast
[1:15:04] <@Menitta> that sounded like a deepfried meme
[1:15:10] <+HefestoForges> it is infinite pierce
[1:15:22] <Finchit> is he playing on controller?
[1:15:23] <exnuart> just wait til he sees the rail gun alt fire
[1:15:29] <bonebagMEL> @brachydios777 No loading, just when changing levels. respawning is pretty much instant (you can spam continue and You'lld rop in right away)
[1:15:32] <+Astrobstrd> I love that opportunity to get a 5 piece there if you're fast enough. It's such a good wink towards the player
[1:15:32] <bonebagMEL> @Finchit yep
[1:15:34] <+mechslayer71> @finchit as always
[1:15:37] <Finchit> omg
[1:15:39] <%Solarint> I think the pixelated graphics settings is causing the bit-rate to fall apart?
[1:15:43] <%Solarint> not sure
[1:15:47] <%justcallmebobplease> Alt fire the Railgun Woolie
[1:15:49] <+Celarious> What railguns you folks rock. I run explosive myself
[1:15:56] <+HefestoForges> LUL
[1:15:59] <c60_Jam> solarint, Yah that's just a streaming thing
[1:16:15] <gryffinp> @Celarious why choose? just whip out the one you want on the fly
[1:16:16] <+HefestoForges> I like the default because of coin tech
[1:16:17] <c60_Jam> Games with large amounts of grass can kill stream quality
[1:16:28] <%Solarint> Yeah, theres a graphics setting to make the graphics not pixelated, though
[1:16:32] <bonebagMEL> Yeah, this game is kind of a bitrate killer
[1:16:38] <%X2Eliah> Twitch is biased against grass
[1:16:38] <%Solarint> its a filter
[1:16:43] <+HefestoForges> @WoolieVersus you can also bounce the railgun off coins
[1:16:44] <bonebagMEL> even without the PSX filters this game goes hard
[1:16:53] <c60_Jam> Ah, true
[1:16:57] <+StooEsq> @celarious mostly the vanilla Railcannon, Malicious if some thing's gotta get blown up, and Drill for fun
[1:17:01] <%Solarint> @X2Eliah I stream tarkov/stalker so GOD I know the pain
[1:17:03] <c60_Jam> Hit them until they are dead, Woolz
[1:17:17] <%Solarint> grass is bitrate hell
[1:17:40] <c60_Jam> Grass was the shadow realm all along
[1:17:56] <+HefestoForges> book
[1:17:59] <gryffinp> There's something very disconcerting about square doors. Possibly the worst part of valheim
[1:18:02] <andre11dr> To bad Woolie doesn't really remember to use the other guns, pretty sure will look at the nail gun for the rest of the stream
[1:18:11] <+HefestoForges> gabriel <3
[1:18:14] <gryffinp> REMAINING TEXT: IRRELEVANT
[1:18:15] <%X2Eliah> Oh right this game has lore xD
[1:18:15] <+blastyoboots> Railgun seems to have a recharged sound cue?
[1:18:35] <Cici_TheMoonRabbit> This Gabriel guy sounds pretty cool
[1:18:35] <+HefestoForges> WTF WOOLS
[1:18:39] <%X2Eliah> @WoolieVersus Is that bibble stuff accurate?
[1:18:44] <exnuart> that wall can be exploded wools
[1:18:45] <+HefestoForges> that was the most breakable wall
[1:18:50] <bonebagMEL> So basically, Grabiel is a non-pleasent person
[1:19:02] <exnuart> @bonebagMEL gabe is p coo
[1:19:02] <+Celarious> Well you get to use it so rarely because of the cooldown and I find situations where malicious should blow up a room more often than a bunch of enemies lined up
[1:19:04] <sir_nack> yeah railcannon has a recharge sound, and a big ol' lightning bolt on the hud for visual cue
[1:19:04] <+blastyoboots> Yeah obvious crack in the wall
[1:19:11] <dds333a> @bonebagmel Gabe is the best
[1:19:19] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[1:19:26] <Lancaster_H> LUL
[1:19:28] <Saltmeisterr> where is Gianni tho
[1:19:30] <dds333a> KEKW Woolie
[1:19:32] <%X2Eliah> Does the wall need three perfectly placed bat-explosive-gels to break?
[1:19:33] <c60_Jam> Gabriel did nothing wrong.
[1:19:43] <@Solidus_113> Woolie loves not needing to aim. the perfect weapon
[1:19:48] <c60_Jam> Move over, Griffith
[1:19:55] <dds333a> perfectly lined up too
[1:19:55] <andre11dr> Azazel is the best, but he ain't canon
[1:19:57] <brachydios777> @saltmeisterr Making shitposts
[1:20:00] <exnuart> pistol works really well for those masks
[1:20:07] <Saltmeisterr> @brachydios777 true
[1:20:16] <%X2Eliah> @exnuart nah Woolie can't aim so pistol is not a good weapon
[1:20:23] <sir_nack> yeah the purple boys dodge projectiles easily, so hitscan pistol is perfect for them
[1:20:36] <BlackermanZX> oh thats totally a breakable wall
[1:20:41] <%phd_in_thuggery> how has he been doing, chat? better than last time?
[1:20:46] <andre11dr> No wait i was thinking of Samael
[1:20:48] <gryffinp> Honestly yes.
[1:20:49] <+HefestoForges> and punching them after death for easy pickoffs
[1:20:55] <%phd_in_thuggery> rad
[1:20:59] <%Kriss1827> Kriss1827 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months!

[1:22:18] <Lancaster_H> theres something really funny about woolie missing the punch twice and just start blasting LUL
[1:22:26] <ronin19xx> Death Stranding giant man
[1:22:37] <Saltmeisterr> oh
[1:22:39] <+HefestoForges> it's dead

[1:28:46] <+ProfessorMorrigan> are they gonna play when its done downloading?
[1:28:59] <%phd_in_thuggery> reminder this game is mostly a one man project
[1:29:06] <hakita> Woolie are you sure you don't want to turn on auto-aim? You might end up regretting that considering what enemy appears in this level.
[1:29:07] <Syrushmx> it sucks XD i was thinking woolz playing with punchmom for that
[1:29:15] <%phd_in_thuggery> WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH YOUR LIFE?

[1:31:03] <gryffinp> honestly he's been doing well without auto-aim, i'm proud of him
[1:31:18] <bonebagMEL> Ey @hakita good to see you here!
[1:31:18] <Lancaster_H> ha
[1:31:24] <$razielhex> This is the same game where they found out you could punch the coins/buckshells
[1:31:27] <$razielhex> right
[1:31:30] <gryffinp> yeah
[1:31:31] <bonebagMEL> @razielhex yee
[1:31:31] <hakita> @gryffinp that'll soon come to an end
[1:31:42] <%Noonoox12> @WoolieVersus @hakita Dev's in chat and he recommends turning on Auto-Aim!
[1:31:52] <blackkanye> @gryffinp Is he using controller?
[1:31:55] <gryffinp> Yep.
[1:31:57] <Cici_TheMoonRabbit> Woolie likes a challenge, we'll see how he fairs coming up.
[1:32:02] <$razielhex> hee..uhh...uses...both
[1:32:06] <+HefestoForges> he gon die
[1:32:16] <andre11dr> Nah he got this
[1:32:23] <Saltmeisterr> i wonder if he will pull out the hybrid
[1:32:23] <+HefestoForges> the tentacles disagree
[1:32:43] <+RahkshiLord> this current tactic will likely work very poorly against the upcoming enemy
[1:32:44] <blackkanye> Using a controller in a shooter with no auto-aim huh? I used to do that
[1:32:49] <bonebagMEL> @Saltmeisterr That's gonna be quite the vibecheck
[1:32:54] <%phd_in_thuggery> he got this
[1:33:01] <Visorak6> You're done, music dropped out
[1:33:10] <sir_nack> but the game totally has auto aim, he just isnt turning it on lol

[1:39:24] <%Solarint> for me, this is where the game got really difficult
[1:39:32] <$razielhex> eating shit
[1:39:34] <%Nested_Dreams> The hand phase was not fun to figure out, but the rest of the fight was pretty great
[1:39:38] <+RealPT1> dno7 OH BIG

[1:43:41] <brachydios777> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[1:43:41] <%Noonoox12> Ok. This fucking rules.
[1:43:46] <%phd_in_thuggery> YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[1:43:54] <andre11dr> This season of Attack on Titan is looking wierd
[1:43:57] <bonebagMEL> Hope you know how to fight yoga catastrophy
[1:43:57] <exnuart> ignore it but dodge it
[1:43:59] <%Solarint> It was this moment where I absolutely fell in love with ultrakill
[1:44:06] <%Nested_Dreams> Sound injured
[1:44:09] <%kewlmyc> Just got here. What happened to It Takes Two?
[1:44:10] <+vaporousTippler> Whoa whoa, when did Woolie get good at shooters?
[1:44:12] <Visorak6> Its a stage hazard
[1:44:19] <sir_nack> oh god hes not gonna stop shooting it is he
[1:44:19] <+Celarious> I don't think he's going to do it but I really hope he does the thing
[1:44:20] <gryffinp> womp
[1:44:22] <+BarbosaEdit> YEAH
[1:44:26] <penitentpendant> It IS building combo multiplier shooting it, weirdly
[1:44:35] <+HefestoForges> the ball is immortal
[1:44:35] <exnuart> black hole is just a chaser to dodge
[1:44:49] <+TONYOO101> btw, you can counter punch the fist attack he does
[1:44:51] <+charcharmunr> He's still trying.
[1:44:53] <+HefestoForges> is he gonna win like this
[1:44:58] <brachydios777> King Minos is a Dante‚Äôs Inferno thing right ?
[1:44:58] <%hologram_sam> y shoot the ball>> why not shoot the man
[1:45:08] <+charcharmunr> It's an HP-to-1 thing, yeah.
[1:45:14] <Lancaster_H> welcome to the family son
[1:45:14] <bonebagMEL> Hakita is probably taking notes on how to communicate that the ball is not the target
[1:45:17] <CoffeeSlice> why is he shooting the ball
[1:45:17] <exnuart> punch his punch
[1:45:18] <thelivingglitch307> a style meter? in an fps?!
[1:45:21] <ronin19xx> @kewlmyc Hes switching to PS5, PC was giving tech issues. Itd downloading
[1:45:22] <+charcharmunr> I don't think the black hole can kill you, at least?
[1:45:22] <penitentpendant> Probably should have not allowed it to build multiplier if you didn't want the player to shoot it
[1:45:26] <%kewlmyc> Woolie, you're shooting a black hole
[1:45:30] <hakita> @bonebagMEL hasnt been a problem until now
[1:45:36] <crimsonsaens> Do you need blue arm to counter punch here?
[1:45:37] <$razielhex> he's always so close to eating shit with that hammerblow
[1:45:42] <gryffinp> I have to admit that this has given me the idea of using nails to create death balls for minos to punch and deal a bunch of damage to himself on
[1:45:42] <andre11dr> I think King Minos is an old Roman thing
[1:45:47] <exnuart> focus the boss not the projectile
[1:45:49] <+StooEsq> sound cutting out should be a feature
[1:45:51] <brachydios777> No blood = not a target
[1:45:55] <bonebagMEL> @bonebagMEL Well... Woolie has a way with things you know, that's why he worked on QA I guess.
[1:46:00] <+charcharmunr> He's still trying.
[1:46:02] <Equirah> @bonebagMEL you're forgetting the woolie factor LUL
[1:46:09] <%Noonoox12> oh
[1:46:09] <+HefestoForges> LUL
[1:46:11] <%Noonoox12> here we go

[1:46:18] <exnuart> it doesn't hurt
[1:46:18] <andre11dr> LUL
[1:46:18] <crimsonsaens> LUL
[1:46:20] <+HefestoForges> ha
[1:46:20] <%Noonoox12> is he gonna realize the ball does no damage to the boss?
[1:46:22] <%hologram_sam> no
[1:46:24] <+HefestoForges> no
[1:46:25] <CoffeeSlice> no
[1:46:27] <Saltmeisterr> no
[1:46:29] <%kewlmyc> IT'S A BLACK HOLE
[1:46:29] <+AnonymousNumbers> no
[1:46:30] <$razielhex> no
[1:46:30] <+HefestoForges> you're hitting his hands
[1:46:31] <brunoberserk> no
[1:46:31] <wqorst> LUL
[1:46:36] <andre11dr> Just shot the boss
[1:46:36] <Visorak6> The ball is a red herring
[1:46:38] <%phd_in_thuggery> HA
[1:46:40] <sir_nack> @WoolieVersus woolie the ball is an obstacle and nothing else
[1:46:42] <exnuart> you're whaling on an invincible target
[1:46:42] <freefa> do not shoot the ball lmao
[1:46:44] <+HefestoForges> shoot his face wools
[1:46:49] <%phd_in_thuggery> ha.
[1:46:49] <$razielhex> it's HAPPY FUN BALL!
[1:46:53] <brachydios777> Woolie figuring it out
[1:46:55] <$razielhex> DO NOT TAUNT HAPPY FUN BALL
[1:46:55] <bonebagMEL> there we go
[1:46:55] <+HefestoForges> bullets, to the face
[1:46:56] <%hologram_sam> now we win

[1:47:26] <andre11dr> Well NOW that figured it out his totally got this Kappa
[1:47:27] <+HefestoForges> it is
[1:47:32] <brachydios777> Is there supposed to be music?
[1:47:33] <gryffinp> oh no he switched to blue hand
[1:47:33] <+HefestoForges> you can parry his punch
[1:47:40] <Meltgar> OH GOD
[1:47:42] <%kewlmyc> That sounds cool as hell
[1:47:43] <+charcharmunr> @brachydios777 I don't think this level has music at all, no.
[1:47:46] <dds333a> absolutely sick shit
[1:47:46] <@Solidus_113> fisted
[1:47:47] <exnuart> early
[1:47:49] <Visorak6> It does work
[1:47:52] <+sewermonk> dmc4 parry lol
[1:47:58] <+HefestoForges> you have to hit it the right time
[1:47:58] <exnuart> way early
[1:48:00] <%hologram_sam> the concussive force of this game rules
[1:48:02] <+PringlesMcGruff> poor dev
[1:48:05] <+PringlesMcGruff> ignored in chat
[1:48:10] <gryffinp> @charcharmunr it does, but it's basically just a drone.
[1:48:13] <bonebagMEL> This is good feedback
[1:48:22] <+HefestoForges> too late
[1:48:28] <+charcharmunr> @gryffinp Right, no 'actual' music then, basically.
[1:48:33] <penitentpendant> The tightness of the parry timing~
[1:48:34] <+HefestoForges> it is tight
[1:48:52] <+TONYOO101> cant remember if you need the blue fist to be able to counter or not
[1:48:57] <Visorak6> Its super tight
[1:49:03] <+charcharmunr> Only blue can parry, so yes. @TONYOO101
[1:49:06] <+ReallyBigRocks> Man, Twitch compression really hates this game huh?
[1:49:08] <andre11dr> Fist him like your gigantes fantasy
[1:49:10] <$razielhex> SUPER. TIGHT. SUPER. TIGHT.
[1:49:11] <bonebagMEL> @TONYOO101 yes, only blue can parry
[1:49:23] <bonebagMEL> @ReallyBigRocks yep
[1:49:33] <+charcharmunr> I think turning down the 'PS1-ness' of the graphics could help the bitrate, but yeah no it's not the best for streaming.
[1:49:35] <gryffinp> needs more pistsol really
[1:49:54] <barbatolover> we believe in you man!
[1:49:54] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:49:58] <+charcharmunr> PHASE 2.
[1:50:08] <$razielhex> super close
[1:50:09] <crimsonsaens> I don't remember phase 2
[1:50:10] <%phd_in_thuggery> got close!
[1:50:11] <ronin19xx> Phase 3
[1:50:12] <brachydios777> Close
[1:50:13] <UnfilteredComic> Can parry that blue one
[1:50:13] <+epoladia> second phase looks easier
[1:50:15] <%hologram_sam> Never Give Up!!
[1:50:21] <+HefestoForges> you can heal with his hands
[1:50:25] <Saltmeisterr> blood is POWAH
[1:50:25] <exnuart> phase 3 significantly easier tbh cause no black hole
[1:50:29] <sir_nack> you can shoot his hands on the walls to get blood
[1:50:42] <ronin19xx> Go for the fingers
[1:50:46] <ronin19xx> Easy target
[1:50:57] <+HefestoForges> nice
[1:51:15] <$razielhex> yoooo
[1:51:19] <+HefestoForges> done
[1:51:23] <blackkanye> BEEG KILL
[1:51:24] <bonebagMEL> yeeeee
[1:51:26] <%Nested_Dreams> Nailed it
[1:51:26] <barbatolover> yay!
[1:51:31] <ZeeJiggle> Right in his mouth hole.
[1:51:31] <+HefestoForges> time for the beast
[1:51:33] <brachydios777> You... did it
[1:51:35] <%hologram_sam> YEEHAW
[1:51:36] <%phd_in_thuggery> woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE
[1:51:41] <freefa> now for the fun zone
[1:51:45] <DSD24> Checkmate
[1:51:50] <crimsonsaens> yay, almost there
[1:51:54] <+charcharmunr> I like how the challenges implicitly give you ideas without telling you explicitly how to do them.
[1:51:55] <gryffinp> I replayed MGR recently and I think that UG Ray 1 might be the best massive-type boss in character action history
[1:52:04] <+HefestoForges> no you don't
[1:52:05] <andre11dr> Yeah we getting close to something
[1:52:06] <Visorak6> No
[1:52:06] <freefa> no
[1:52:14] <exnuart> its DMC rorbs
[1:52:18] <UnfilteredComic> You get less at the end of the stage i think if you die
[1:52:18] <bonebagMEL> @andre11dr We just need to stay motivated
[1:52:22] <+StooEsq> hint hint
[1:52:30] <%Noonoox12> @gryffinp HARD agree
[1:52:30] <exnuart> vore stage
[1:52:32] <+charcharmunr> Now we're inside the boss.
[1:52:38] <$razielhex> You ever play a level that can take a bite outta you/
[1:52:49] <bonebagMEL> This song? also slaps
[1:52:51] <+charcharmunr> Which is something that didn't click with me initially, that this is Minos' body.
[1:52:52] <DSD24> Fetus of God time?
[1:52:53] <bonebagMEL> but it hits different
[1:52:55] <+HefestoForges> LUL
[1:52:57] <ronin19xx> LUL
[1:53:01] <brachydios777> I wonder if lucifer will be a boss in the full release
[1:53:03] <Lancaster_H> LUL
[1:53:04] <+RealThiele> dumpstered
[1:53:08] <+HefestoForges> use blue for faster punchparry
[1:53:08] <gryffinp> love those moments where you accidentally click on the frame you die
[1:53:10] <+Celarious> Realistically you should get healed just by shooting the walls
[1:53:13] <+charcharmunr> @brachydios777 We'll see when we see.
[1:53:16] <$razielhex> this is a white blood cell right
[1:53:27] <exnuart> @razielhex god of war 3 had the whole thing with being eaten by a titan
[1:53:28] <+charcharmunr> @Celarious Why? Only living blood seems to work and Minos is now dead.
[1:53:29] <Lancaster_H> i prefer PREYs anus doors myself
[1:53:30] <penitentpendant> "I don't mean to alarm you. But your esophagus has multiple separate mouths. Are you perhaps descended from a xenomorph?"
[1:53:56] <$razielhex> @exnuart Hell, the best horror game they ever played was when they got trapped inside the intestines of a house's basement
[1:53:58] <brachydios777> Also Halo 3 had Flood anus doors
[1:54:01] <gryffinp> There's a decent chance that rather than a boss, lucifer will be a massive frozen chained entity whose three heads are the final stage that you fight an actual cool guy on
[1:54:04] <%jepupu> Prey had more like... vag doors
[1:54:10] <$razielhex> rather than the intestines of a hedgehog
[1:54:11] <andre11dr> This is a cool level, fighting inside of the boss
[1:54:14] <hoosyrdady> why'd they stop it takes two?
[1:54:24] <+HefestoForges> origin didn't work
[1:54:29] <$razielhex> Is BIGGS THE CAT IN THIS LEVEL!?
[1:54:34] <brachydios777> Origin borked it
[1:54:36] <Saltmeisterr> Theres a giant eye
[1:54:43] <penitentpendant> @hoosyrdady Overclocked the fans on the PC. Dangerous to play atm.
[1:54:54] <$RunningNGunning> Twitch compression really cant handle this game
[1:54:59] <hoosyrdady> are they gonna switch to console, or is it just dead in the water?
[1:55:00] <+RealThiele> door genital undulation
[1:55:16] <+charcharmunr> @RunningNGunning It's mostly just this weapon that fucks the bitrate, the others aren't usually that bad.
[1:55:20] <alephalpha> can you still instakill mindflayers by usinga parried shotgun explosion to push their bullet sback intot hem with the right timing?
[1:55:23] <%phd_in_thuggery> I love a good fetus of god stage
[1:55:29] <brachydios777> This is definitely the most Hell Hell has looked so far in this game
[1:55:34] <%Deft_Thought> This game looks cool as hell but I can't for the life of me keep up
[1:55:49] <+HefestoForges> that trigger finger
[1:55:57] <+grimzanarky> i cant see whats going on XD
[1:55:57] <+charcharmunr> @Deft_Thought Isn't helped by the fact that the stream can't really keep up with the amount of VFX.
[1:56:01] <hakita> @Deft_Thought The options have an assist mode that let you change the game's speed anywhere between 50-100%
[1:56:02] <gryffinp> This track is called "Guts" on the OST
[1:56:08] <+HefestoForges> LUL
[1:56:09] <$razielhex> eye see you
[1:56:24] <bonebagMEL> @hakita I hope you do a horror game soundtrack some time. I think You'd be great at it
[1:56:36] <jmepik> finally more ultrakill
[1:56:38] <+HefestoForges> wtf
[1:56:49] <Saltmeisterr> dig up
[1:56:50] <exnuart> out of the water
[1:56:50] <UnfilteredComic> just jump up
[1:56:53] <gryffinp> you did not fall through anything, except water
[1:56:56] <+HefestoForges> just jump out
[1:56:56] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:57:04] <+charcharmunr> Yeah I actually like just how well-made the assist options are. Reminds me of Celeste where it's a pretty hard game as standard but offers super solid assist options.
[1:57:14] <+HefestoForges> time for boosted enemies
[1:57:16] <exnuart> its not weird its just dark
[1:57:36] <penitentpendant> Eyes on the inside!
[1:57:41] <%Noonoox12> @hakita that's a great assist option. I love that.
[1:57:45] <$razielhex> that was an esophagus; sphinctre door is still a hope
[1:57:55] <%hologram_sam> the mouth sounds are actually delicious, that's the only way to describe them
[1:58:01] <acexclover> woolie what is this game and why are there so many awsome bullets flying
[1:58:06] <$razielhex> SSSSSSSTYLIN
[1:58:10] <exnuart> imagine having an eye at the top of your stomach
[1:58:27] <jmepik> I think they're dead man
[1:58:28] <$razielhex> that's an ulcur
[1:58:29] <Cici_TheMoonRabbit> I guess he's "watching what he eats".
[1:58:30] <%hologram_sam> technically every door is a sphincter
[1:58:34] <bonebagMEL> @exnuart "Oh, so that's what It hurt..."
[1:58:35] <Meltgar> Is this the only weapon they have aside from the pistol?
[1:58:35] <brachydios777> Shouldn‚Äôt V1 get refueled every time he is in that blood pool?
[1:58:36] <andre11dr> Woolie you have a raingun charge
[1:58:37] <$razielhex> King Minos had GERD
[1:58:39] <DeathByPoke7> eyes on the inside
[1:58:40] <+HefestoForges> SourPls
[1:58:42] <gryffinp> This track is called "Glory" on the OST
[1:58:45] <bonebagMEL> this song SLAPS
[1:58:46] <+charcharmunr> @brachydios777 Has to be fresh blood I guess.
[1:58:47] <Saltmeisterr> BANGER ALERT
[1:58:52] <ronin19xx> Nice stage
[1:58:57] <sir_nack> @Meltgar there are two other weapons, but woolie seems to have forgotten
[1:59:00] <+vaporousTippler> Reminds me of playing Breath of Fire 2 in the mid 90s on a bad emulator.
[1:59:02] <freefa> damn he almost used the shotgun for a second there lmao
[1:59:07] <+vaporousTippler> The music, I mean.
[1:59:08] <+HefestoForges> SourPls SourPls SourPls
[1:59:10] <$razielhex> nice
[1:59:13] <$RunningNGunning> SourPls
[1:59:16] <andre11dr> Does Woolie still not understand that the bolt means that the railgun is charged?
[1:59:16] <Lancaster_H> SourPls
[1:59:27] <+charcharmunr> @Meltgar There's 4 weapons so far, and each has 2 variants (except the railgun which has 3) so far.
[1:59:27] <exnuart> dat drum track
[1:59:31] <$razielhex> a non-whilhelm scream for falling?
[1:59:59] <+HefestoForges> LUL
[1:59:59] <bonebagMEL> @exnuart it f u c k s
[2:00:01] <gryffinp> The hypest gameplay on twitch
[2:00:03] <Lancaster_H> @andre11dr hed have to stop shooting to use it tho, thats a no no
[2:00:09] <$razielhex> Wait, I know this sample
[2:00:21] <bonebagMEL> @razielhex yo, drop it. I wanna know
[2:00:28] <+jepupu> This game would seem like it'd be much easier with a mouse.
[2:00:45] <$razielhex> that arpeggio sounded super familiar
[2:00:47] <+charcharmunr> @jepupu I'm not sure how robust the aim assist and whatnot is for controllers yet, so probably.
[2:00:47] <bonebagMEL> @jepupu it is, but we have seen woolie play with a mouse, it's even worse.
[2:00:56] <hakita> @jepupu it'd also be much easier with a controller if you use auto-aim
[2:00:57] <+HefestoForges> LUL
[2:01:03] <%Solarint> music makes me feel like a teenager again LUL
[2:01:08] <SheefEatsBeef> this always reminded me of a muse song
[2:01:09] <gryffinp> I respect the decision to not turn on auto-aim
[2:01:16] <Go4theKnees> s u p r e m e
[2:01:17] <+HefestoForges> arena time
[2:01:21] <Cici_TheMoonRabbit> Really dig the classical elements in these tracks.
[2:01:25] <UnfilteredComic> This room is for real
[2:01:28] <bonebagMEL> Dude this room is a fuck... I had a lot of trouble getting rough it
[2:01:36] <Solarint> need to go listen to some pendulum after this
[2:01:37] <+RahkshiLord> currently has 7 gun variants, uses 1 of them. that's not very stylish of you
[2:01:43] <sir_nack> the last room in this level always kicks my ass
[2:01:58] <gryffinp> The last room in this level was actually made easier a few months ago
[2:02:13] <andre11dr> Yeah I'm pretty sure Woolie forgot this game has multiple guns
[2:02:20] <gryffinp> I never managed to s-rank the old one and it kinda bums me out that I never beat that challenge, but the new version does definitely flow better
[2:02:42] <Lancaster_H> ha
[2:02:53] <penitentpendant> Face Time is go
[2:02:56] <+StooEsq> PSone had a lot of Drum & Bass, so it's only fitting Ultrakill with its PSone visuals has it too
[2:02:56] <bonebagMEL> C'mon woolie you are almost at it, your big reward
[2:03:45] <+HefestoForges> you got him but he got you
[2:04:36] <+RahkshiLord> You know what's really good against the faces? The shotgun.
[2:04:37] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1376753284791296000?s=19
[2:05:05] <Jashter18> He's doing it
[2:05:12] <+HefestoForges> oh no
[2:05:17] <+HefestoForges> you didn't hit it
[2:06:49] <gryffinp> That phase of that room used to have FOUR malicious faces, it was nuts
[2:06:56] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @razielhex
[2:07:27] <+HefestoForges> LUL
[2:07:34] <gryffinp> sound go brrr
[2:07:34] <bonebagMEL> Yeah this room is a real fuck
[2:07:42] <Meltgar> Just shoot them woolie Kappa
[2:07:42] <gryffinp> shotgun
[2:07:47] <alephalpha> shotgun
[2:07:48] <+HefestoForges> @WoolieVersus 3rd charge of shotgun to the face
[2:07:48] <freefa> railcannon or shotguns
[2:07:48] <Lancaster_H> if only you had any other weapon
[2:07:49] <gryffinp> go in, shoot them hard at close range, get out
[2:07:52] <bonebagMEL> Turn on auto aim and use shotgun
[2:07:53] <+HefestoForges> you have to hit it all
[2:07:53] <exnuart> go back and check your rail upgrades
[2:07:53] <brachydios777> Like the Railgun?
[2:07:55] <UnfilteredComic> shotgun time?
[2:07:55] <sir_nack> would be nice if you had some sort of shot gun. or maybe even like, a rail cannon of sorts
[2:07:56] <user_naim> Did this game have difficulty settings, or is it just ‚Äùdo it‚Äù?
[2:08:03] <+HefestoForges> nooooo
[2:08:04] <bonebagMEL> @user_naim It has normal and hard, so far
[2:08:07] <+HefestoForges> explosions bounce off them
[2:08:13] <gryffinp> @user_naim in the current version of the game, there are two difficulty settings. Woolie is on the lower one.
[2:08:14] <user_naim> @bonebagmel cool thanks
[2:08:15] <andre11dr> HA HA HA
[2:08:16] <exnuart> @user_naim has difficulty settings but only 1 available rn
[2:08:25] <$razielhex> there's so much going on here and I can't keep up well because I have difficulty seeing the color red.
[2:08:44] <bonebagMEL> @razielhex Oh... yeah that'd be a problem in this level lol
[2:08:48] <hakita> The next update (coming within a couple weeks) has the 2 easy modes, but the game also has an assist mode where you can tweak game speed and damage values
[2:08:50] <UnfilteredComic> @razielhex Bitrate doesnt treat it too well either
[2:08:52] <Saltmeisterr> Doesn't help that the bitrate is a mess
[2:08:55] <+AnonymousNumbers> @razielhex There's accessibility settings for that, you can turn on enemy silhouettes
[2:09:12] <+HefestoForges> does that come with act 2 @hakita ?
[2:09:13] <exnuart> @razielhex its a bit of a problem if you can see red too
[2:09:14] <UnfilteredComic> @hakita Ooo a few weeks you say, nice
[2:09:17] <sir_nack> grenade bounce off faces woolie, use the pump
[2:09:21] <+HefestoForges> use the PUMP
[2:09:22] <hakita> @HefestoForges no
[2:09:34] <hakita> Malicious Faces are immune to explosions
[2:09:34] <+HefestoForges> oh T-T
[2:09:36] <Visorak6> Woolie theyre immune to explosions
[2:09:46] <sir_nack> oh god hes trying to do it the hardest way he can
[2:09:57] <$razielhex> like, as long as the things are moving and contrast, but like, the guns and the fireballs and the blood and the explosions are all red and my protanopia makes it all look like mud & shit.
[2:09:58] <+RahkshiLord> reminder that malicious faces are immune to explosions
[2:10:11] <+HefestoForges> it's violent mud
[2:10:17] <$razielhex> the violent mud
[2:10:17] <exnuart> @hakita will the next update include that person 5 inspired zone? Kappa
[2:10:41] <+RahkshiLord> it does not that's part of act 2
[2:10:45] <$razielhex> this is the small intestines, so this is all villa
[2:10:54] <ronin19xx> Dev says faces are immune to explosions @WoolieVersus
[2:10:55] <Lancaster_H> LUL
[2:10:55] <Visorak6> You're on the wrong arm LUL
[2:10:55] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @sir_nack
[2:10:57] <+StooEsq> Shotgun can parry, too
[2:11:05] <$razielhex> haven't had a good small intestine level since Earthworm Jim 2.
[2:11:06] <+HefestoForges> use blue arm and pump shotgun wools
[2:11:11] <Detectivemac9> Woolie... lived a hard life..
[2:11:35] <+Dnarbredlih> Disco Elysium is out pog
[2:12:20] <user_naim> Oh the dev is here? Cool

[2:13:58] <$razielhex> Hydrochloric acid, really
[2:14:20] <Visorak6> Yep teleports
[2:14:24] <gryffinp> it was really more around the wall
[2:15:43] <$razielhex> the instant respawn and music never dropping was a good design choice to maintain unrelenting momentum
[2:16:23] <bonebagMEL> If @hakita is still here, have you considered something along the lines of "easy mode is now selectable"?
[2:16:37] <user_naim> I appreciate poison/lava that just instantly kills you. Especially in a fast game like this
[2:16:53] <839ricky> shotgun time. You keep shooting and forgetting you have your magnet dart on
[2:16:58] <sir_nack> it doesnt kill instantly though
[2:17:01] <$razielhex> "Easy mode is now selectable" when you win and it's just 1-life
[2:17:46] <hakita> Considering that not using auto-aim means the nailgun is the only weapon Woolie can use consistently, I'd really recommend turning on auto-aim
[2:17:54] <sir_nack> woolie please try the shotgun once i beg you
[2:18:02] <user_naim> @sir_nack oh? i guess i wasn‚Äôt paying attetion. seemed pretty quick though.
[2:18:04] <$razielhex> that's a Quake Style Nailgun huh?
[2:18:24] <gryffinp> @hakita I don't don't if you remember woolie's first stream but it was also 100% nailgun
[2:18:46] <hakita> @gryffinp I know, just saying
[2:19:01] <+HefestoForges> he's nailing himself
[2:19:06] <b_ikki> brrrrr

[2:23:22] <brachydios777> Vergil/Redemer
[2:23:26] <penitentpendant> "SwordTRICKTRICKSWORD" Says the boss
[2:23:29] <bonebagMEL> Round trip, helm split
[2:23:32] <crimsonsaens> The boss made for Woolie
[2:23:37] <+HefestoForges> ALMSOT
[2:23:41] <bonebagMEL> HE ALMOST SAID IT
[2:23:44] <T_Sasquatch> Is this an update ?
[2:23:52] <Detectivemac9> gabriel don't play
[2:23:54] <+charcharmunr> @T_Sasquatch Nah, just Woolie playing it.
[2:23:56] <%Solarint> I have no idea how this is going to be possible on controller without auto aim
[2:24:01] <bonebagMEL> no this boss is super hard
[2:24:01] <PMda2nd> bodying you and talking all the smack
[2:24:11] <$razielhex> Couldn't get Christopher Walken to reprise his role, huh @hakita
[2:24:12] <exnuart> aim assist might be helpful
[2:24:14] <+HefestoForges> he can't parry so it'll be hard
[2:24:20] <T_Sasquatch> @charcharmunr oh thanks , i thought he beat it
[2:24:26] <exnuart> blue to parry woolz
[2:24:30] <%Solarint> we found the WALL
[2:24:31] <brachydios777> TWO HEALTH BARS
[2:24:41] <alephalpha> @Solarint I play on controller due to issues with my hands and you cna just aim good
[2:24:47] <exnuart> sliding helps
[2:24:48] <Agami23> "NOT EVEN MORTAL!" is such a good insult
[2:24:54] <gryffinp> @Agami23 yes.
[2:25:05] <+charcharmunr> @Agami23 I do like just how much he hates that V1 isn't even alive.
[2:25:07] <bonebagMEL> oops
[2:25:08] <+Namtaskic> Is this game like DOOM?
[2:25:15] <$razielhex> what game isn't @Namtaskic
[2:25:17] <gryffinp> its not NOT like doom
[2:25:18] <DeafevaPC> doom and dmc in one
[2:25:19] <+charcharmunr> @Namtaskic More Quake, and Devil May Cry.
[2:25:26] <bonebagMEL> @Namtaskic more like quake + Devil May cry
[2:25:29] <+Namtaskic> @razielhex I was asking a legit question
[2:25:31] <Agami23> its not like doom, its way more mobile and stylish
[2:25:32] <crimsonsaens> One good burst fire does so much damage, Woolie can totally do this on controller
[2:25:35] <thelivingglitch307> @Agami23 sounds like a compliment to me
[2:25:35] <+Namtaskic> Quake and DMC hmmm
[2:25:37] <+HefestoForges> "stand back and observe"
[2:25:38] <ronin19xx> Look at whats happening
[2:25:43] <exnuart> devil may quake
[2:25:43] <+Namtaskic> I'm seeing the DMC vibes
[2:25:44] <PMda2nd> one hit ko?
[2:25:47] <thelivingglitch307> QMC
[2:25:55] <sir_nack> maybe shoot with something other than the nailgun
[2:25:56] <+charcharmunr> DMQ. @thelivingglitch307
[2:25:57] <+HefestoForges> learn his patterns wools
[2:25:57] <bonebagMEL> @pmda2126 More like 2, but you get hit really quick
[2:26:11] <bonebagMEL> he's starting to see it
[2:26:13] <ronin19xx> There you go

[2:27:19] <ZeeJiggle> @charcharmunr Maybe in some kind of Extra Version, a Special Edition, if you will.
[2:27:30] <+charcharmunr> @gryffinp V2 is just V1 but red though.
[2:27:34] <gryffinp> YEAH
[2:27:40] <Lancaster_H> ha

[2:29:33] <thelivingglitch307> what about he other angels? do they scream?
[2:29:33] <Meltgar> Dang
[2:29:34] <exnuart> yea this is a rough fight on controller
[2:29:38] <crimsonsaens> Chat, can you parry any of Gabriel's attacks?
[2:29:38] <ronin19xx> Is It Takes Two even happening?
[2:29:44] <Meltgar> It's a thing that you gotta RESERVE the dashes?
[2:29:46] <+charcharmunr> @crimsonsaens His projectiles can both be parried.
[2:29:49] <exnuart> @crimsonsaens with feedbacker
[2:29:53] <+ManimalCrackerss> FOOLISHNESS
[2:29:55] <$razielhex> less than nothing
[2:29:57] <+charcharmunr> His melee attacks cannot be parried though.
[2:30:01] <crimsonsaens> Okay, thanks
[2:30:02] <penitentpendant> @ronin19xx Perhaps if there's a patch that makes it not melt computers
[2:30:12] <andre11dr> Man this arena and boss reminds me a lot of Metatron in SMT3 for some reason
[2:30:23] <+charcharmunr> Parrying the spear throw is straight out of Credo's fight, it's great.
[2:30:27] <ronin19xx> Surely it finished downloading

[2:31:10] <+charcharmunr> Gabriel is more Bury the Machine or something. I think he's all in on the light.
[2:31:11] <+HefestoForges> he has to learn how to lowdiff the first phase to win
[2:31:23] <$razielhex> he's getting sloppy and not playing defense anymorew
[2:31:30] <Lancaster_H> literally rage against the machine
[2:31:31] <Saltmeisterr> im surprised gluttony only has 2 stages
[2:31:32] <penitentpendant> @charcharmunr Correct, his first health bar was destroyed so he was 'half' buried
[2:31:32] <alephalpha> so why is woolie only using the nail gun?
[2:31:39] <ronin19xx> Gun is going nuts
[2:31:49] <+charcharmunr> @alephalpha Because he doesn't wanna auto-aim and it's the only weapon that works reasonably on controller without auto-aim.
[2:31:53] <$razielhex> @alephalpha No auto-aim, and his weird half-controller half-mouse set-up
[2:31:56] <Saltmeisterr> HE SAID THE THING
[2:31:57] <blackkanye> Foolishness
[2:31:58] <blackkanye> LUL
[2:32:01] <+AnonymousNumbers> railcannon pls
[2:32:01] <+HefestoForges> it's not hybrid
[2:32:03] <gryffinp> The taunt time is definitely the moment to go in and heal
[2:32:15] <%Nested_Dreams> Gabriel is a neat fight, it's easy to dodge his attacks but not necessarily his entire string
[2:32:17] <hakita> This is definitely full controller only
[2:32:21] <%Solarint> this boss fight easily took me 50+ deaths on M+kb
[2:32:21] <+charcharmunr> "Your crime is existence" is also a STRONG line.
[2:32:29] <alephalpha> @charcharmunr oh thta's weird I play on contorller dues to my hands and you cna still aim well enough
[2:32:39] <andre11dr> Why dosen't he take a shot with the raygun ?
[2:32:48] <+RahkshiLord> reminder that if you're out of dashes, try sliding instead
[2:32:53] <$razielhex> Highlander rules baby
[2:32:56] <+charcharmunr> @andre11dr Woolie's kind of on 'shoot all the time forever' mode.
[2:32:58] <PMda2nd> "Your crime is existence" BARS
[2:33:02] <bonebagMEL> @andre11dr Playing on a controller with no aim assist makes it near impossible to hit him with anything else
[2:33:04] <839ricky> shotgun!
[2:33:07] <+HefestoForges> woolie your approach doesn't work
[2:33:10] <exnuart> aim assist?
[2:33:12] <penitentpendant> Sword is that gap closer, for sure
[2:33:16] <bonebagMEL> @exnuart hopefully....

[2:33:45] <exnuart> @Bizerak yes
[2:33:57] <+HefestoForges> you gotta hit his head tho
[2:33:58] <jmepik> pistol is my fav for this, but with fairly precise aim
[2:34:12] <+HefestoForges> yeah that's not good
[2:34:19] <exnuart> slide
[2:34:20] <+Bizerak> This is metal
[2:34:28] <andre11dr> Oh yeah hitting this boss with the coins is super satisfying

[2:35:07] <%cobalt_phoenix_> so when does he say "SHCUM"
[2:35:08] <+charcharmunr> @justcallmebobplease I mean, the game's referencing DMC a lot, this is just the most overt.
[2:35:10] <andre11dr> Yeah he does the Vergil
[2:35:19] <Qu1ckyyy> Damn I thought they were gonna play Ultrakill tomorrow, how much did I miss?
[2:35:23] <jmepik> slab revolver is amazing
[2:35:27] <Visorak6> Turn auto-aim on?
[2:35:28] <%justcallmebobplease> Woolie don't think, FEEL.
[2:35:31] <+charcharmunr> He taunts like Vergil, fights like Vergil and Credo.
[2:35:31] <%justcallmebobplease> BE LIKE WATER
[2:35:32] <sir_nack> @WoolieVersus consider turning on auto aim?
[2:35:33] <ronin19xx> He sweatin

[2:36:16] <Agami23> im just confused as to why the nailgun
[2:36:16] <andre11dr> Yeah why would you switch in a action FPS
[2:36:43] <andre11dr> It's not like using multiple guns is part of the design or anything
[2:37:05] <PrideOfFiddles> He can do it, just gotta believe
[2:37:20] <+trackles_64> F
[2:37:23] <TheyCallMeVawn> ???
[2:37:23] <gryffinp> The secret is that the shotgun is the real no-aim weapon. You gotta actually aim the nailgun but with the shotgun you just get close enough that the enemy fills your screen and let er rip

[2:39:23] <thelivingglitch307> more shredding yeah kromiaStab

[2:42:11] <gryffinp> woolie's real problem is that his movement isn't there
[2:42:17] <+cubbywolf> gabriel go brrrrrr
[2:42:25] <thelivingglitch307> never let go of shoot
[2:42:26] <EuGeniius> @gryffinp he needs to change his sensitivity
[2:42:38] <gryffinp> No, not his aim, his MOVMENT
[2:42:43] <thelivingglitch307> just like playing Nero
[2:42:54] <+HefestoForges> dead sound
[2:42:56] <EuGeniius> @gryffinp he needs to implement aimbot
[2:42:57] <exnuart> we might need to go hybrid
[2:42:58] <+cubbywolf> is woolie using his monster hybrid system or just a controller?
[2:43:04] <+charcharmunr> Just controller.
[2:43:12] <+cubbywolf> man f that system imo
[2:43:16] <+charcharmunr> Now Gabe mad.
[2:43:24] <+charcharmunr> @cubbywolf Eh, I see why people use it, but it's not for me.
[2:43:25] <%cobalt_phoenix_> he do it
[2:43:26] <+HefestoForges> woolie when you hear the teleport, dodge
[2:43:27] <Visorak6> You're panic-dashing a lot

[2:44:36] <exnuart> @EuGeniius you not seeing how jerky these turns are?
[2:44:45] <andre11dr> @cubbywolf It's definitely like a weird "THE KEYBOARD KILLED MY PARENTS" tipe of configuration LUL
[2:44:50] <thelivingglitch307> @cubbywolf maybe when the devil stops making people cry
[2:44:57] <TabaxDM> ha. ha. ha. ha.
[2:44:57] <EuGeniius> @exnuart LUL LUL i dont even know whats going on LUL
[2:45:18] <andre11dr> But i get it ,moving with a controller is cool in FPS
[2:45:25] <eyedol33> The only bad part of following Gabriels VO is that I don't hear him anymore I just hear Gianni lol
[2:45:44] <ronin19xx> Strafe and 180
[2:45:55] <ronin19xx> Dodge through and 180
[2:45:58] <jmepik> my day be so fine

[2:46:04] <+cubbywolf> @thelivingglitch307 maybe when we FILL YOUR DARK SOUL WITH LIGHT
[2:46:05] <jmepik> v1 :'(
[2:46:07] <+charcharmunr> @eyedol33 I feel like Gianni's got enough range that it's fine, but he shitposts as Gabe a LOT so fair.
[2:46:09] <+HefestoForges> outclassed
[2:46:15] <%Afterman_> so he just decided no it takes two today?
[2:46:21] <ronin19xx> @jmepik Gabriel
[2:46:34] <Karhax> why not use the rail gun weapon on Cookstown?
[2:46:43] <ronin19xx> @Afterman_ I mean since hes here in Ultrakill might as well
[2:46:47] <jmepik> @ronin19xx that was in Gabriel's POV
[2:46:52] <Karhax> cool down*
[2:46:55] <jmepik> from a shitpost
[2:46:57] <eyedol33> @charcharmunr Oh I definitely dont mean it as a slight against Gianni. The man is an amazing VO.
[2:46:58] <ronin19xx> @jmepik Ohhh
[2:47:15] <Lancaster_H> SPD
[2:47:16] <%Afterman_> @ronin19xx fair. I knew he was having problems earlier but i had to run some errands. wasnt sure if it was just UK until ITT finished installing or if he just decided to swap days

[2:49:13] <penitentpendant> @MugenSandan From what I've seen so far: Spear is Jump Attack into Throw Explosive Spear. Sword is to port forward, melee combo into throw sword. Two daggers(?) shot.

[2:50:12] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 50 minutes
[2:50:56] <thelivingglitch307> you know your doing something right when the audio cuts out
[2:51:03] <1800wubsalot> good afternoon
[2:51:14] <jmepik> never let gabe leave your sight
[2:51:21] <andre11dr> It's midnight
[2:51:52] <bonebagMEL> This is like Peach, but backwards
[2:51:57] <thelivingglitch307> casualizing the judge of hell as Gabe LUL
[2:52:03] <Karhax> why is Woolie not using the railgun when it's available?
[2:52:07] <hakita> Gabriel taunting is a 3 second pause where it's safe to heal
[2:52:09] <1800wubsalot> The music in ultrakill is so good
[2:52:16] <+charcharmunr> @Karhax Because his gameplan is 'shoot forever'.
[2:52:16] <sir_nack> @Karhax hes just not switching weapons at all
[2:52:23] <penitentpendant> @thelivingglitch307 Who knew he'd have a side job at Penny Arcade?
[2:52:25] <eyedol33> Probably cuz the rail requires aiming LUL
[2:52:33] <%Chichen> this is pretty much the same experience i had with this fight LMAO
[2:52:53] <+black_pariah> @Karhax takes too long for him to switch, apparently
[2:52:55] <+HefestoForges> died to slam
[2:52:56] <bonebagMEL> Yeah this fight is pretty hard, not gonna lie
[2:52:57] <+HefestoForges> dunked
[2:53:02] <Karhax> not switching weapons isn't very stylish
[2:53:02] <andre11dr> Damn we're so mean to Woolie this session LUL
[2:53:27] <SiegmundCG> the slow controller movements are agonizing but it's fine
[2:53:29] <user_naim> WoolieStaresAt. Menacingly
[2:53:30] <@Menitta> this the final boss?
[2:53:37] <bonebagMEL> I love that this is possible in this game, like this is a viable option
[2:53:38] <$razielhex> That was it. Mozart influences in this act.
[2:53:40] <bonebagMEL> @Menitta yep
[2:53:43] <+HefestoForges> yeyeyeyeye
[2:53:43] <@Menitta> damn
[2:53:43] <eyedol33> yeyeye
[2:53:45] <exnuart> for now

[2:53:50] <penitentpendant> Destroy that audio!
[2:53:50] <+HefestoForges> JUGGLED
[2:53:51] <sir_nack> not the final boss, the boss of act 1
[2:53:58] <eyedol33> damn
[2:54:02] <stevenellis386> aaawwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
[2:54:03] <@Menitta> he's got this

[2:54:20] <Pnutz409> reggie lol
[2:54:22] <user_naim> progress though
[2:54:29] <thelivingglitch307> c'mon Gabe we are on a schedule here...
[2:54:34] <gryffinp> Not gonna lie, I genuinely like the nailgun in its current form and I'm kinda bummed it's getting changed, I get it though.
[2:54:35] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:54:40] <andre11dr> Yeah this game gets more acts as development goes along, so FOR NOW this is the final boss
[2:54:54] <$razielhex> *whispering* He's learning. He's Believing
[2:54:55] <Karhax> if only there was a way to quickly switch weapons with some sort of number keys located close to your movement
[2:55:02] <+HefestoForges> he slams twice
[2:55:03] <CoffeeSlice> inaff
[2:55:09] <exnuart> 3 helm splitters
[2:55:14] <hakita> @gryffinp It's in a bad spot because it's not useful for skilled players but too easy to be used as a crutch for less experienced ones
[2:55:15] <vincerocmm> woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE
[2:55:21] <penitentpendant> The combo extenders of Phase 2
[2:55:26] <crimsonsaens> Woolie really could benefit from dashing in to heal during taunts.
[2:55:29] <+HefestoForges> @Karhax not on controller, that's dpad
[2:55:34] <+HefestoForges> then you stop moving
[2:55:55] <andre11dr> He could just have Reggie hold the Keyboard and yell at him the weapon he wants to switch too LUL
[2:55:56] <sir_nack> health would be easier to manage with the shotgun, one good shot and youve got most of your life back
[2:55:57] <+HefestoForges> he's consistently getting to phase 2 now, which is good
[2:56:02] <Karhax> @hefestoforges well there's your problem
[2:56:03] <Meltgar> Damn
[2:56:04] <gryffinp> @hakita I kind of think of it like the cavaliere in dmcv, it doesn't play as well with the other weapons but it combos with itself really well, so if you're willing to switch to it for a minute or two it's a good time
[2:56:10] <bonebagMEL> ooooh, on normal 1 he doesn't get spin swords on fase 2
[2:56:11] <%ThisIsLloyd> I was watching someone practice against him the other morning and she like got the parry down on him perfect it was so rad
[2:56:17] <+trackles_64> Did i ever tell you the definition of insanity?
[2:56:28] <Meltgar> So is woolie's gun chaser but deals less damage compared to the other weapons?
[2:56:30] <1800wubsalot> @hakita you make good game
[2:56:49] <penitentpendant> @trackles_64 The scientific process with poor control variables
[2:56:57] <+mtlsars> Hes cooler than in the Bible it seems
[2:57:06] <thelivingglitch307> the difference is the count on tries
[2:57:14] <andre11dr> Well which Bible?
[2:57:21] <thelivingglitch307> King James
[2:57:22] <Meltgar> Gamestop Bible Kappa
[2:57:25] <eyedol33> @Meltgar The alt fire of the nailgun shoots a magnet that the nails beeline too.
[2:57:28] <+trackles_64> The Torah
[2:57:43] <Meltgar> @eyedol33 That's rad, thanks for info SeemsGood
[2:57:43] <vincerocmm> woolieSPICE woolieKICKDAD woolieGLORY
[2:57:48] <$razielhex> Inshallah
[2:57:54] <andre11dr> Cause OG angels are some creepy ass Lovecraft level of monsters
[2:57:54] <+mtlsars> I wish they told me about his spear throws and explosion attacks is all, would have made sermon more legit
[2:57:55] <%illtima> I don't remember this SMT game
[2:57:58] <Saltmeisterr> PFFT
[2:58:17] <Meltgar> BIG DAMAGE
[2:58:23] <Agami23> you know what would make your finger stop hurting? winning
[2:58:30] <sir_nack> hes literally causing himself pain by only using the nailgun
[2:58:31] <penitentpendant> @mtlsars When you want the edition of the bible that gives a move list for each character
[2:58:33] <thelivingglitch307> for real tho King James version is overratted
[2:58:44] <CoffeeSlice> aww
[2:58:44] <Meltgar> lytSTUMBLE lytSTUMBLE lytSTUMBLE lytSTUMBLE
[2:58:46] <$razielhex> that was a good run for a minute
[2:58:55] <+FuqBoiSlim> just stop losing 4Head
[2:59:04] <+trackles_64> is this a no hitrun or something?
[2:59:15] <+charcharmunr> @trackles_64 No, he's just struggling.
[2:59:27] <$ParatrooperDylan> It‚Äôs a tough game
[2:59:36] <+mtlsars> @penitentpendant wouldn't that be awesome though , Bible move list
[2:59:38] <gryffinp> @WoolieVersus walk up to him while he's taunting
[2:59:39] <thelivingglitch307> he refuses auto aim
[2:59:39] <Louie_Salmon> This boss took me like 2-3 hours to beat
[2:59:48] <hakita> Yeah, no auto-aim means he can't use weapons other than the nailgun, and because the nailgun's bad at healing, he can't really heal during the fight
[2:59:56] <+Acecorleone> that little ass platform is some doodStare
[3:00:10] <andre11dr> I will say as far as angels design goes SMT 4 has some crazy ass designs for the 4 angels
[3:00:12] <BlackermanZX> auto aim is for chumps anyways
[3:00:16] <sir_nack> if he could at least switch to the shotgun he could keep himself alive
[3:00:22] <+charcharmunr> @hakita I mean you don't need to aim MUCH with the shotgun, but yeah.
[3:00:22] <penitentpendant> @mtlsars You'd get the problem of tier listing. Which angel is best? How god is Jesus compared to human/angels.
[3:00:24] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah a drive-by shotgun is really the only reliable heal
[3:00:41] <bonebagMEL> shotgun + big punch gets you 100 hp I think
[3:00:48] <hakita> @charcharmunr You have to turn to face the enemy to hit them which can be tricky on a controller when they're as fast as Gabriel
[3:00:53] <+mtlsars> whats SMT 4??? like devil digital saga or nocturne type of thing? or like P4???
[3:01:00] <+charcharmunr> @hakita Also fair.
[3:01:04] <penitentpendant> @mtlsars It'd be really funny though if different sects emerged for different tier lists
[3:01:08] <+charcharmunr> @mtlsars I assume they mean SMT4, like... SMT4.
[3:01:18] <+mtlsars> like in the lore they have cool designs for the angels a la Metatron and whatnot
[3:01:38] <gryffinp> He's gotten better about not burning out the dashes
[3:01:38] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1376753284791296000?s=19
[3:01:50] <gryffinp> there we go, he got in during the taunt
[3:02:02] <BlackermanZX> oh shit hes doing it doodWat
[3:02:02] <andre11dr> @mtlsars If your asking what it looks like, it a mix of 3D and 2D
[3:02:10] <+Hyphixsys> this game is too high octane Kappa
[3:02:11] <+charcharmunr> I'll be honest I never knew the taunt was, like, a 'thing' he did. I thought they were just lines playing as he did stuff.
[3:02:33] <gryffinp> Nah, it's every few attacks he stands there and taunts, I think it's two attacks in phase one and three in phase two
[3:02:34] <%Chichen> WOOLIE VS GOD continues
[3:02:36] <Meltgar> Blue dashes YOU GOTTA DASH, but the other attacks i can't seem to know how to not get gutted
[3:02:36] <andre11dr> Like it has a 3D world like Nocturne but the fights are 2D
[3:02:51] <Meltgar> Problem is that you gotta ration at least ONE dash
[3:02:52] <CoffeeSlice> gabe cmon man
[3:03:02] <penitentpendant> @charcharmunr They're basically a 'minimove' you can get in to melee and heal, but it's a small window.
[3:03:05] <CoffeeSlice> aw
[3:03:09] <gryffinp> @Meltgar Actually, sliding is the best way to avoid a lot of attacks, especially his overheads
[3:03:10] <bonebagMEL> DO THAT
[3:03:12] <stevenellis386> you can do it woolie coxStare
[3:03:14] <sir_nack> good, now keep doing that please
[3:03:18] <+mtlsars> oh ill look into that then , im intrigued
[3:03:18] <BlackermanZX> that was good
[3:03:21] <+RealPT1> gotta score that blood
[3:03:32] <+charcharmunr> @penitentpendant Yeah, I've beaten Gabe a few times, I never knew he was like that. Just learned his other moves, really.
[3:03:34] <bonebagMEL> "mix ups" you may call it
[3:03:34] <crimsonsaens> It was teleport to taunt, the optimal combo
[3:03:36] <+RealPT1> Tasty Blood
[3:03:42] <Agami23> imagine woolie seeing the crazy shit you can do by flicking out coins then raygunning them
[3:03:52] <+mtlsars> 3DS.......no wonder
[3:03:56] <+charcharmunr> Juggling Gabe is always a fun point.
[3:04:03] <sir_nack> come on man at least get close to heal during the knockdown
[3:04:17] <penitentpendant> @charcharmunr Boss design is always interesting because a fun boss is 'fair' even if it doesn't look like it at first
[3:04:32] <thelivingglitch307> juggling with bullets in general is pretty devilnPOG_HF
[3:04:34] <stevenellis386> eye of the tiger woolie tovgHype nicobMight nicobMight
[3:04:41] <+charcharmunr> @penitentpendant Oh I know he's fair, I just never knew about his taunts being, like, a 'safe point'.
[3:04:43] <andre11dr> @mtlsars Just keep in mind there's SMT 4 and SMT 4 Apocalypse and Apocalypse is sequel to 4 kinda
[3:04:58] <+charcharmunr> @penitentpendant Doesn't really have an animation so it never clicked.
[3:05:07] <gryffinp> he crosses his arms though
[3:05:16] <BlackermanZX> the devil cry huh doodNuts
[3:05:18] <+charcharmunr> Ah. Then the animation is just hard to notice.
[3:05:30] <%kewlmyc> I take it he's just a giant DMC reference?
[3:05:34] <+trackles_64> Need a 3090 to beat this boss
[3:05:36] <+charcharmunr> @kewlmyc This whole game is.
[3:05:38] <+mtlsars> did woolie mean....the Throw???
[3:05:39] <penitentpendant> @charcharmunr Yup. It's one of the things you don't get a good chance to see in the moment but get a more clear understanding from watching others.
[3:06:01] <SiegmundCG> tfw permanent D rank
[3:06:15] <PrideOfFiddles> Not bad
[3:06:16] <+charcharmunr> @penitentpendant It's neat to know, though. Wonder what other things I've not noticed.
[3:06:16] <+HefestoForges> he tried
[3:06:23] <CoffeeSlice> bruh
[3:06:28] <thelivingglitch307> switching should still be considered
[3:06:28] <+kennneh> Controller or K&M?
[3:06:29] <andre11dr> Well this is quite Destructive
[3:06:29] <ATPsoldat> has woolie tried reflecting?
[3:06:44] <+charcharmunr> @ATPsoldat He's more-or-less stuck himself to using the red arm, so.
[3:06:46] <skyentombment> FOOLISHNESS
[3:06:47] <andre11dr> Controller
[3:06:55] <+Hyphixsys> FOOLISHNESS DANTE, FOOLISHNESS
[3:07:00] <brachydios777> I think Gabrial was supposed to be red but then he clashed with the background so thay gave the color scheme to V2, could be wrong
[3:07:00] <free2dayaccount> Does woolie know he can unequip weapons?
[3:07:02] <Agami23> theres no enemies in this level but the boss, you can go back and unequip your weapons
[3:07:10] <CoffeeSlice> what
[3:07:24] <+charcharmunr> @brachydios777 I believe that's true, if you look up the artstation concept art for him.
[3:08:26] <Meltgar> Kinda want to see how much damage does the shotgun vs gabriel
[3:08:31] <user_naim> But is Gabriel holding down back?
[3:08:35] <Karhax> does woolie have the green railgun? the dot one
[3:08:36] <Meltgar> But then again, woolie is doing great with the nailgun
[3:08:42] <andre11dr> Off the stage you go
[3:08:42] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:08:52] <tukds> What contol option is Woolie using? The hybrid or Keyboard?
[3:09:01] <ATPsoldat> if woolie playing this on Mouse and Keyboard?
[3:09:04] <hakita> The nailgun is good against Gabriel in terms of damage, it's just the worst weapon at healing, which makes this particularily difficult
[3:09:05] <andre11dr> Just controller
[3:09:07] <ATPsoldat> *is
[3:09:07] <%Mathochism> Pop in and first thing I see is a Stylish meter. Now I know why Woolie is playing this, lol.
[3:09:15] <crimsonsaens> @Karhax No, I don't believe he does.
[3:09:26] <BlackermanZX> just realized this boss literally has helm splitter doodWat
[3:09:26] <+trackles_64> You are outcalssed
[3:09:30] <ATPsoldat> oh neat, Hakita is here
[3:09:41] <+mtlsars> you have no dignity!
[3:09:43] <+Celarious> I personally beat Gabe by getting right in his face and triple pump shotgunning him
[3:09:44] <tukds> casual filter
[3:09:56] <+Celarious> I was able to just outheal the damage
[3:09:56] <Meltgar> Go full DOOM ETERNAL mode woolie
[3:09:57] <bonebagMEL> If only they'd look at the universe
[3:09:59] <sir_nack> @WoolieVersus use the shotgun to heal
[3:10:11] <andre11dr> Yeah tm
[3:10:11] <hakita> The red punch is also good for healing
[3:10:25] <tukds> just circle strafe
[3:10:33] <thelivingglitch307> @Mathochism it even has a few tiers same as DmC
[3:10:42] <user_naim> MOOD LANTERN
[3:10:50] <andre11dr> You can totally just explode him with shotgun explosions but you have to dash those
[3:11:02] <+charcharmunr> Can't remember what I did to beat Gabe first time. I think it was just kind of 'frantically doing whatever seemed to work'.
[3:11:14] <+mtlsars> sometimes all you need is a 5 min break lol
[3:11:21] <user_naim> brb?
[3:11:21] <%Mathochism> @thelivingglitch307 Why am I not surprised?
[3:11:28] <+HefestoForges> woolie try to parry the projs
[3:11:33] <LorcaNomad> I was stuck on this boss for like 30 minutes, he's a toughie
[3:11:35] <thelivingglitch307> Because your smart (:
[3:11:37] <+trackles_64> thiink wooolie overthinks the strats to much
[3:11:37] <ATPsoldat> @HefestoForges Red arm, so no
[3:11:42] <hakita> You can probably get a punch in during a taunt
[3:11:43] <Visorak6> His projectiles can be blue parried
[3:11:43] <stevenellis386> eye of the tiger nicobCrazy nicobCrazy nicobCrazy
[3:11:44] <andre11dr> I think i just exploded him with shotgun and then finished him off with the pistol
[3:11:55] <bonebagMEL> Not botches as long as you can heal
[3:11:57] <sir_nack> he just gets himself so stuck in one strategy unfortunately
[3:12:03] <skyentombment> instant botch, just add stream!
[3:12:10] <free2dayaccount> Cybergrind break to reset?
[3:12:14] <Agami23> i just kept shotgun jousting him myself. kept healing off the damage
[3:12:18] <exnuart> woolie needs the age old advice of just dont get hit
[3:12:40] <Karhax> getting hit is fine if you heal
[3:12:40] <+Hyphixsys> this game is destroying the stream LUL
[3:12:44] <ATPsoldat> shoot it until it dies :)
[3:12:44] <skyentombment> Just dodge the hits
[3:12:46] <Saltmeisterr> jesus christ audio
[3:12:47] <SiegmundCG> kinda glad they're supposedly nerfing this gun cus i don't wanna hear this noise the whole lp
[3:13:02] <+ReallyBigRocks> I think the winning strategy would be to shoot the boss a lot and also don't get hit by things
[3:13:02] <thelivingglitch307> Just hit Gabe more 4Head
[3:13:13] <+Hyphixsys> @thelivingglitch307 5Header
[3:13:14] <andre11dr> You know you're winning when the audio fucks itself
[3:13:15] <Lancaster_H> @SiegmundCG bold of you to assume that would stop woolie from using it
[3:13:25] <SiegmundCG> oof
[3:13:29] <CoffeeSlice> which sekiro route is this
[3:13:35] <Visorak6> IT BROKE
[3:13:52] <+Hyphixsys> OH NO

[3:13:53] <penitentpendant> @CoffeeSlice This is Sekiro 2, where he went west and ended up in hell fighting angels
[3:13:55] <Meltgar> OH DAM
[3:13:57] <andre11dr> This the Chaos route
[3:13:59] <gryffinp> What's woolie talking about?
[3:14:04] <penitentpendant> @CoffeeSlice So a reverse Nioh
[3:14:06] <Visorak6> The twin axes can break apparently?
[3:14:18] <@Menitta> you've made even the devil may cry
[3:14:23] <andre11dr> If we where law this dude would be our buddy
[3:14:31] <@Menitta> OH
[3:14:32] <+Hyphixsys> LUL that audio
[3:14:33] <Meltgar> WOAH AUDIO
[3:14:42] <@Menitta> aw
[3:14:43] <skyentombment> AUDIO'S GETTING hype!
[3:14:54] <andre11dr> Missed
[3:14:55] <+Hyphixsys> LUL LUL
[3:15:01] <brunoberserk> this is the final boss ?
[3:15:01] <+charcharmunr> Yeah, the audio does that when a lot of damage is dealt at once. I think it's a glitch or it started as one but the dev just kept it in.
[3:15:08] <+ReallyBigRocks> the game can't handle all these sound effects
[3:15:15] <andre11dr> @brunoberserk For now, yes
[3:15:36] <skyentombment> Decry your instincts
[3:15:50] <KaiserMario> I'm glad Woolie plays fighting games so he knows the best strategy is to use same 2 moves over and over again and never anything else
[3:15:50] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:15:58] <+bigslinglelino> Just reduce his health to zero while keeping your health above zero ez
[3:16:12] <+mtlsars> ohhh this is promising!
[3:16:16] <ATPsoldat> What is his revolver btw?
[3:16:21] <crimsonsaens> @KaiserMario You'd be surprised how often that can work in fighting games.
[3:16:22] <+mtlsars> and I jinxed it
[3:16:24] <skyentombment> maybe, maybe
[3:16:30] <user_naim> Is Woolie‚Äôs TV also perfectly calibrated?
[3:16:39] <andre11dr> Ok BUT THIS ONE THO
[3:16:45] <KaiserMario> @crimsonsaens Yeah, like with Shao Kahn
[3:17:03] <+Hyphixsys> DAMN!
[3:17:04] <BlackermanZX> COME ON
[3:17:04] <Meltgar> CLOSE
[3:17:05] <CoffeeSlice> aw damn
[3:17:05] <PrideOfFiddles> That was a really good run
[3:17:05] <BlackermanZX> DAMMIT
[3:17:05] <Visorak6> Oooof
[3:17:06] <+Hyphixsys> so close!
[3:17:07] <skyentombment> shit
[3:17:11] <andre11dr> Never mind
[3:17:11] <%BinaryFireball> this aim
[3:17:15] <skyentombment> we're getting there tho
[3:17:20] <thelivingglitch307> Chaotic
[3:17:21] <1800wubsalot> You got this woolie
[3:17:40] <andre11dr> But now THIS is the one im telling you
[3:17:49] <$razielhex> everyone got their bits ready for when he does it
[3:17:59] <thelivingglitch307> !unmotivated
[3:18:07] <skyentombment> this game's use of the instant retry has a very Hotline Miami effect, in that it gets you super addicted REAL fast
[3:18:07] <Agami23> why is woolie punching?
[3:18:10] <+Bob_Tom> oh hell yeah grabiel.
[3:18:14] <+kennneh> Dopes his hitbox get smaller the secpnd phase?
[3:18:16] <andre11dr> Damn it
[3:18:16] <SiegmundCG> Feel like i used the slide for this boss fight, makes you way more mobile
[3:18:18] <gryffinp> Because hakita tried to tell him to use the punch to heal
[3:18:22] <penitentpendant> @Agami23 You heal if you hit bosses while in melee
[3:18:22] <hakita> Punching is much better at getting health back than the nailgun
[3:18:25] <andre11dr> I'm not doing it
[3:18:50] <Agami23> but the shotgun is better than the punch at healing
[3:19:06] <ATPsoldat> Perhaps it's time for the shotty to shine?
[3:19:11] <thelivingglitch307> Doom logic never stand still
[3:19:16] <+Bob_Tom> honestly nailgun isnt too great against gabriel imo. shotugn was my MVP
[3:19:16] <bonebagMEL> ABM: Always Be Moving
[3:19:17] <Agami23> woolie is talking to his brain
[3:19:17] <UnfilteredComic> but he wants to play with the nailgun which is fine, he can probably make it work
[3:19:19] <Lancaster_H> dont go jason waterfalls
[3:19:25] <Karhax> woolie "has" several healing options, he just nailguns
[3:19:25] <sir_nack> i think we can give up on the idea of him switching weapons at this point
[3:19:29] <+MugenSandan> honestly once woolie can understand the helm breaker timing he's got this
[3:19:43] <andre11dr> BRRRRRRRRRRRT
[3:19:46] <gryffinp> the nailgun is great for healing... if you go in
[3:19:47] <Lancaster_H> PJSalt
[3:19:47] <brunoberserk> Woolie VS his brain
[3:19:57] <TheyCallMeVawn> Woolie vs Mind goblins
[3:19:59] <gryffinp> no weapon choice will ever heal woolie if he remains at fullscreen length
[3:20:01] <SiegmundCG> could try sliding around it's faster than walking
[3:20:02] <%AyotoCorp> I think the timing is actually identical to Vergil's helmsplitter
[3:20:05] <user_naim> WoolieStaresAt
[3:20:05] <skyentombment> So when's easy mode unlocking?
[3:20:05] <+kennneh> I don't think Woolie is even looking at chat.
[3:20:08] <KaiserMario> Poor Reggie, he's trying his best...
[3:20:11] <CoffeeSlice> i feel bad for reggie
[3:20:19] <G03933> are we gonna get to see Woolie break his controller live on stream?
[3:20:23] <user_naim> you can do it
[3:20:32] <crimsonsaens> You can heal though
[3:20:35] <gryffinp> woolie trying to die and gabe takes a moment to just stand there and taunt
[3:20:36] <+ProfessorMorrigan> attempt #214
[3:20:47] <ATPsoldat> @G03933 is he playing this with a controller? That might explains many thing.
[3:20:56] <andre11dr> Yeah there's a timing to the helm breaker ,once he has it this will be in his pocket
[3:20:57] <thelivingglitch307> sadge
[3:20:59] <skyentombment> @user_naim Pat Vs
[3:21:00] <sir_nack> if only he had some kinda way to aim automatically. if only.
[3:21:09] <andre11dr> IF ONLY HE HAD BETTER AIM
[3:21:10] <lobso123> Lol you‚Äôre overthinking in overkill
[3:21:13] <Agami23> dont see, feel
[3:21:19] <user_naim> ‚Äù...goes to fuck!‚Äù is a good phrase
[3:21:23] <%MooseIsGoose> Heart of the cards woolie come on
[3:21:26] <G03933> @ATPsoldat Woolie cant use mouse and keyboard, he never learned how and it frustrates him
[3:21:30] <+Bailey__gaming> That boss name screams Ya dont know what ya messin wit
[3:21:42] <BlackermanZX> doing a shit ton of damage though
[3:21:47] <thelivingglitch307> Brutal
[3:21:49] <Lancaster_H> "dont let him hitcha ya idiot!"
[3:21:55] <rReizs> Savage
[3:21:57] <%Solarint> this is honestly one of the hardest FPS bossfights I've ever faught
[3:22:05] <MidnightPacif1c> nothin personnel
[3:22:12] <+charcharmunr> I'm trying to remember how many tries Gabe took me.
[3:22:22] <user_naim> So this is God‚Äôs elaborate revenge for Woolz‚Äô DOOM playthroughs, right?
[3:22:31] <andre11dr> I was definitely here for like an hour
[3:22:33] <ATPsoldat> @G03933 yeah, this is just like DUSK with Pat all over again.
[3:22:34] <BlackermanZX> "Why i can't never tech the throw" doodOuch
[3:22:35] <+charcharmunr> I don't think it was TOO many, but I sort of cottoned on to a good strategy pretty quick.
[3:22:36] <+ProfessorMorrigan> Mada mada koi inu yo...
[3:22:36] <%Chichen> my wrist hurt after finally beating this boss lol
[3:22:39] <+Bob_Tom> @Solarint honestly i felt the fight with the mirror match bot was harder. had to cheese that one while this fight was actually doable
[3:22:47] <thelivingglitch307> @user_naim maybe
[3:22:58] <+RevFoREVer> i spent so long trying to parry his sword throw credo style
[3:22:58] <+charcharmunr> @Bob_Tom Yeah, I think Gabe is more 'solve-able'.
[3:22:58] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:23:08] <sir_nack> @WoolieVersus maybe try auto aim?
[3:23:15] <exnuart> use auto aim?
[3:23:17] <+Hyphixsys> pain is the true motivator Kappa
[3:23:22] <bonebagMEL> I'm sure he can figure it out
[3:23:23] <+Bob_Tom> shotgun is great for close quarter
[3:23:24] <Agami23> so is woolie using controller? or is he using the hybrid?
[3:23:26] <+RevFoREVer> shotgun gains health the best
[3:23:27] <+charcharmunr> Shotgun.
[3:23:29] <Visorak6> Shotgun
[3:23:29] <Meltgar> Shotty?
[3:23:32] <sir_nack> shotgun gives great health.
[3:23:33] <crimsonsaens> Shotgun
[3:23:36] <rReizs> has to be controller looking at the reticle performance
[3:23:37] <gryffinp> The thing is all of the weapons gain health back, you just have to be close up
[3:23:37] <%AyotoCorp> Charge pistol
[3:23:42] <skyentombment> Release the Easy Mode gates?
[3:23:49] <+charcharmunr> You can unequip everything but the nailgun and shotgun?
[3:23:53] <Detectivemac9> Gabe is a much stricter fight as far as strategy, there's a general game plan you HAVE to follow for this fight whereas V2 you can just kind of shoot him
[3:23:53] <Agami23> and that strategy is failing lol
[3:24:04] <%justcallmebobplease> Okay but mid-range IS NOT WORKING FOR YOU, though
[3:24:08] <BlackermanZX> gotta learn the matchup then
[3:24:08] <andre11dr> If you can hit those shotgun shoots and go back to nail that would do it
[3:24:11] <+SteinsApprentice> More of thing Yesssss
[3:24:12] <Agami23> change fist
[3:24:15] <%AyotoCorp> Wrong arm
[3:24:18] <gryffinp> you can't do it with the red hand woollie
[3:24:18] <Agami23> you cant parry with exploding fist
[3:24:24] <+HefestoForges> use the blue arm
[3:24:25] <Visorak6> @WoolieVersus you can parry back his projectiles with blue fist btw
[3:24:26] <andre11dr> Still need to dodge the move tho
[3:24:27] <sir_nack> oh my god.
[3:24:27] <bonebagMEL> give him a sec, he'll notice it
[3:24:31] <%Chichen> i punch shotty'd him to death
[3:24:34] <@Menitta> oh GOD THATS COOL
[3:24:40] <+HefestoForges> you can punch gabriel's projectiles
[3:24:42] <crimsonsaens> Remember that is not great for healing though
[3:24:43] <%ChoculaUltra> they should add titanfall 2 movement to Ultrakill
[3:24:43] <thelivingglitch307> seems like arbitrary parry rules
[3:24:54] <+ReallyBigRocks> alright, first try lets go
[3:24:57] <sir_nack> woolie knows he can use the shotgun without parrying it, right? its normal shot is great.
[3:24:59] <andre11dr> Don't forget you can blow him up too
[3:25:03] <+charcharmunr> @thelivingglitch307 Not really. Projectiles can be parried, as can melee attacks with 'glints'.
[3:25:07] <gryffinp> don't forget that the shotgun is also a shotgun
[3:25:12] <andre11dr> But you gotta hit the dash
[3:25:16] <@Menitta> your crime is existence. Chaos CHAOS
[3:25:17] <+Bob_Tom> FOOLISHNESS
[3:25:23] <reddpop_> Gabriel'
[3:25:31] <SiegmundCG> don't do the fancy thing just shoot him
[3:25:39] <reddpop_> Gabriel's VA does some amazing shitposts in character
[3:25:47] <PrideOfFiddles> No more constant muzzle flash in the middle of the screen woolieYE
[3:25:51] <+Exicuren> !motivated
[3:25:51] <@Moobot> 2168 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[3:25:52] <sir_nack> hes making it so hard on himself
[3:25:57] <brunoberserk> FOOLISHNESS DANTE
[3:26:01] <+HefestoForges> dodge, dodge punch his throws
[3:26:05] <@Menitta> he sounds like the announcer in SF4
[3:26:12] <andre11dr> Now this sounds quiet all the sudden LUL
[3:26:16] <+HefestoForges> +DISRESPECT tho
[3:26:21] <BlackermanZX> i miss the BRRRT
[3:26:24] <+RevFoREVer> does anyone know how many acts ultrakill is gonna have overall?
[3:26:25] <shinichizio> Yeah he's throwing out what, DMC references, Highlander, some Diablo?
[3:26:32] <KaiserMario> At least now Woolie can see what he's doing...
[3:26:33] <+charcharmunr> @RevFoREVer 3. It's on the main menu.
[3:26:35] <hakita> @RevFoREVer 3
[3:26:43] <+HefestoForges> word from dev
[3:26:43] <ATPsoldat> @RevFoREVer as of now, 3. Work in progress
[3:26:45] <+RevFoREVer> ah thanks im dumb
[3:26:46] <Visorak6> Its the lack of auto aim, trying to aim with the middle of the screen and letting movement do the aiming is murdering him
[3:26:53] <emeraldskrull> woolieDATTEBAYO_HF woolieDATTEBAYO_HF woolieDATTEBAYO_HF
[3:26:54] <+Celarious> The pro of using the shotty over nailgun is getting right in his face and healing
[3:27:07] <thelivingglitch307> devilnPOG_HF
[3:27:17] <+charcharmunr> Honestly punching the shotgun doesn't do a lot against Gabe.
[3:27:21] <+Bob_Tom> i think youre putting too much focus on the punch
[3:27:22] <+HefestoForges> woolie that throw is parriable
[3:27:26] <+charcharmunr> Just shooting him is better.
[3:27:27] <Saterion> Punch back gabriel's weapon?
[3:27:27] <Agami23> dont punch
[3:27:27] <sir_nack> you dont have to punch the shotgun woolie.
[3:27:32] <user_naim> Look at all that HEALTH
[3:27:35] <Visorak6> Stop punching the shotgun
[3:27:40] <+AnonymousNumbers> woolie stop punching the shotgun
[3:27:43] <sir_nack> @WoolieVersus you can use the shotgun without punching. it works like a normal FPS shotgun
[3:27:44] <+ReallyBigRocks> if you wanna do that you gotta CLAW
[3:27:45] <PrideOfFiddles> Wait, is punch on R3?
[3:27:47] <+Celarious> use the pump shotty instead
[3:27:55] <exnuart> punching the shot isn't worth it on single enemies
[3:28:33] <sir_nack> the pump variant works very well on gabriel i find
[3:28:38] <tukds> Woolie unironically git gud
[3:28:43] <+Selectamo> this looks very difficult
[3:28:44] <Visorak6> Use the other variant yeah
[3:28:57] <andre11dr> Ha
[3:29:02] <free2dayaccount> I think I see why he was using nail gun
[3:29:05] <Visorak6> Dont fully pump it
[3:29:09] <WinstonFromUndertale> Oh is woolie still doing the weird controller/mouse thing? Probably a bit harder considering it‚Äôs a keyboard mouse game innit?
[3:29:10] <+RevFoREVer> tbh nailgun was working way better
[3:29:10] <skyentombment> Looks much harder than the first strategy
[3:29:15] <gryffinp> its kinda frustrating to watch as gabe starts taunting next to woolie giving him the perfect chance to shotgun him, and woolie fires and dashes away from the blood
[3:29:18] <sir_nack> oh my god.
[3:29:21] <thelivingglitch307> just DO IT
[3:29:23] <+charcharmunr> @WinstonFromUndertale This is controller only.
[3:29:28] <exnuart> gitgud
[3:29:31] <ATPsoldat> I know woolie doesn't like this but I feel like this would be much easier if he learns to use M&K
[3:29:32] <SiegmundCG> controller meta lesgo
[3:29:41] <+TheKojac> kick gianni's ass!
[3:29:42] <andre11dr> You can do it multiple ways
[3:29:46] <Agami23> the hybrid would have won
[3:29:56] <+RealPT1> Woolie:We have guns at home
[3:30:11] <hakita> @ATPsoldat Or if he turned on auto-aim. I'm probably gonna have to ask him after the stream why he doesn't want to use it, since it's insanely hard to play with a controller without auto-aim
[3:30:12] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1376753284791296000?s=19
[3:30:13] <thelivingglitch307> Guns at home:
[3:30:21] <PrideOfFiddles> Railgun so good at regaining hp
[3:30:31] <BlackermanZX> ocasional raligun seems good
[3:30:36] <Qu1ckyyy> railgun full healed nice
[3:30:37] <+TheManilaMile> He was soooo close
[3:30:39] <sir_nack> does he think you have to pump the green shotgun all the way? he has to know you can shoot it safely after one or two pumps, right?
[3:30:49] <+TheManilaMile> BIG DAMAGE
[3:30:57] <CoffeeSlice> LUL
[3:31:08] <thelivingglitch307> you have to out-improve him

[3:31:49] <radar410> Foolishness...
[3:31:50] <bonebagMEL> take a break
[3:31:50] <Agami23> time for auto aim?
[3:31:51] <sir_nack> @WoolieVersus even the dev is suggesting auto aim woolie.
[3:31:52] <Detectivemac9> @hakita if it were me having streamed for over an hour trying to beat this man with gimped controls I wouldn't be able to stop either, I've invested too much
[3:31:52] <+vaporousTippler> My kingdom for a checkpoint!
[3:31:53] <gryffinp> foooolishnessss, machiiiiiiiiine. foooooolllllliiiiiissshhhnneeeesssssss
[3:31:56] <ATPsoldat> @wmeldrum with this fight, yes.
[3:31:58] <+bigslinglelino> woolie big mad
[3:31:58] <%OmegaWeltall> Rage Quit rising
[3:32:01] <Saterion> A A A A
[3:32:02] <+MosesUnspoken> Woolie seems like he's enjoying himself
[3:32:05] <andre11dr> LUL
[3:32:09] <+sewermonk> easy mode is now selectable
[3:32:09] <user_naim> @wmeldrum controller with no auto aim seems pretty hard
[3:32:12] <SiegmundCG> poor reggie is so uncomfortable lmao
[3:32:17] <skyentombment> INSANITY
[3:32:18] <bonebagMEL> This reminds me the first time I was at mission 20 of DMC3
[3:32:19] <Qu1ckyyy> railgun is good for heals
[3:32:27] <exnuart> no shame in auto aim
[3:32:34] <+RealPT1> I think he tried auto aim last time but it messed up his katamari nail strategy
[3:32:37] <stevenellis386> eye of the tigerrrr nicobMight nicobMight nicobMight
[3:32:44] <user_naim> @bonebagmel Oh yeah this does have that feel
[3:32:52] <ATPsoldat> I mean that's if you violate COVID 19 distancing policy @Qu1ckyyy
[3:32:59] <Lancaster_H> swing and a miss
[3:33:01] <brunoberserk> wait , gabriel just did a '' helm breaker '' ?
[3:33:03] <+RealPT1> he could't build up nails if they kept going at enemies on screen
[3:33:08] <+Nekolaius> gabriel is the best shit
[3:33:11] <user_naim> @atpsoldat railguns are alt-medicine
[3:33:17] <IntenseNerdRage> Just keep losing until you learn the matchup
[3:33:21] <skyentombment> This is LO.....Tier....... Woolie!
[3:33:29] <lovepeace0> ULTRAKILL!
[3:33:29] <Visorak6> Use auto aim
[3:33:32] <Agami23> try the hybrid
[3:33:34] <sir_nack> @WoolieVersus auto aim
[3:33:34] <Visorak6> For your own sake
[3:33:39] <exnuart> auto aim it
[3:33:41] <ATPsoldat> @user_naim like i said, if only woolie violates personal distancing with Gabe here
[3:33:44] <lostallmyaccs> I feel like less than nothing is better than nothing, random thoughts
[3:33:46] <lovepeace0> This is familliar
[3:33:47] <gryffinp> gotta go spend 1000 hours playing unreal tournament
[3:33:50] <PrideOfFiddles> You got him down to 10~15% hp YOU CAN DO THIS
[3:33:51] <BlackermanZX> surpass your limits right here right now doodSurvive
[3:33:56] <+Nekolaius> woolie wants no tips right?
[3:34:01] <Agami23> if only there was an auto aim in the options
[3:34:02] <sir_nack> if only he had access to some kind of other aim correcting tool...hmm....
[3:34:04] <CoffeeSlice> auto aim, robot. auto aim
[3:34:05] <+Superbro64> I wonder if gyro aiming would help out in this case
[3:34:08] <+zaworldo> uSE auto aim man
[3:34:11] <user_naim> @atpsoldat i‚Äôm a fan of vaccines, but i could go for a railgun tbh
[3:34:17] <andre11dr> There is an autoaim if you feel your not good enough @woolieversus
[3:34:18] <sir_nack> please one of them read chat and see auto aim
[3:34:24] <+vaporousTippler> Has gyro aim ever been good in anything?
[3:34:27] <SiegmundCG> AUTO AIM! AUTO AIM!
[3:34:27] <gryffinp> he knows about the auto aim you guys
[3:34:28] <@Solidus_113> yes
[3:34:29] <dds333a> oh boy
[3:34:37] <+charcharmunr> @vaporousTippler Splatoon.
[3:34:37] <sir_nack> @vaporousTippler gyro aim is great in everything ive used it in
[3:34:38] <+zaworldo> NotLikeThis
[3:34:48] <+vaporousTippler> Huh. Never would have thought.
[3:34:56] <crimsonsaens> @vaporousTippler Gyro aim is good for shooters when paired with a stick for larger movements
[3:35:00] <%bvanbove> Tuning in to Woolie with serious FPS face and Reggie just watching in wide-eyed silence was perfect.
[3:35:05] <andre11dr> YEYEYEYE hit him with coins
[3:35:06] <Agami23> you know, i've never tried gyro aim but i've only ever heard good things
[3:35:06] <+Nekolaius> does he know he can juggle gabriel when he transitions?
[3:35:07] <+Superbro64> sweaty splatooners swear by it, apparently
[3:35:15] <lostallmyaccs> auto aim would be like selecting auto on DMC, AKA worst than using items
[3:35:22] <+vaporousTippler> I blame Red Steel 1 for turning me off from it.
[3:35:29] <skyentombment> @bvanbove This has been a punishing stream for Woolo
[3:35:34] <thelivingglitch307> DMC makes you to use auto aim
[3:35:37] <hakita> @lostallmyaccs Nope, the auto-aim was added specifically because it's super hard to play the game on a controller without aim assist
[3:35:43] <+Superbro64> red steel 2 was the one which used the wii mote plus, no?
[3:35:45] <ATPsoldat> @lostallmyaccs and woolie's not using K/M so might as well compensate.
[3:35:52] <$razielhex> one hour down boys
[3:35:54] <lostallmyaccs> I see
[3:35:59] <BlackermanZX> Die already you winged pos doodWat
[3:36:13] <dds333a> NOT EVEN MORTAL
[3:36:23] <IntenseNerdRage> Just Ex when he slam dude
[3:36:24] <skyentombment> FOOLISHNESS
[3:36:26] <IntenseNerdRage> Kappa
[3:36:27] <%bvanbove> woolieDATTEBAYO_SG
[3:36:28] <+zaworldo> Use the auto aim man it's b u i l t for controller
[3:36:39] <thelivingglitch307> This is like Woolie trying to main Tomboy devil breaker
[3:36:45] <user_naim> ok that projectile IS a bit tough to see sometimes
[3:36:49] <Deasmeister> Is the auto aim super aggressive or something besides slowing down the cursor over an enemy?
[3:37:05] <exnuart> is auto aim woolie goblins?
[3:37:07] <gryffinp> The last time I saw the auto-aim in action it was HILLARIOUSLY aggressive
[3:37:10] <crimsonsaens> @Deasmeister Yeah, it is
[3:37:10] <hakita> @Deasmeister It's very aggressive because of how fast both the player and enemies move
[3:37:12] <Visorak6> Auto aim makes the gun point towards the enemy as long as they're near the reticle
[3:37:12] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:37:12] <andre11dr> Just think, how do you stop Vergil in Marvel
[3:37:21] <andre11dr> Oh wait you don't
[3:37:22] <Detectivemac9> @lostallmyaccs it's different because ultrakill was designed specifically as a PC game with speedy, difficult to hit targets, controller without assist is masochism
[3:37:27] <lostallmyaccs> I think he can do it without the Auto Aim
[3:37:38] <+theedom> theedom subscribed with Prime.
[3:37:40] <+RevFoREVer> im so excited for how hard act 3 bossess are gonna be after seeing v2 and gabe
[3:37:41] <Detectivemac9> I think he can do it but it's gonna hurt
[3:37:41] <emeraldskrull> woolieDATTEBAYO_HF woolieDATTEBAYO_HF woolieDATTEBAYO_HF
[3:37:49] <Visorak6> You can juggle him to half HP, I think
[3:37:54] <+zaworldo> Can he? yes. will he hate it? also yes
[3:37:54] <BlackermanZX> air juggle yeyeye
[3:37:59] <IntenseNerdRage> can't you prep nailbomb once he does 2nd phase
[3:38:03] <+MosesUnspoken> "Oh" LUL
[3:38:06] <+Hyphixsys> LUL
[3:38:07] <PMda2nd> o
[3:38:08] <+skylerpilot> you can juggle him a bit in the transition
[3:38:09] <crimsonsaens> I would suggest to not even bother with the railgun during the juggle, the nailgun can juggle him for more damage
[3:38:11] <+charcharmunr> @RevFoREVer You should look forward to Act 2 first. This is Act 1.
[3:38:11] <+Nekolaius> @Visorak6 can you hit 50% with railgun??
[3:38:14] <lostallmyaccs> the hurt is worth it imo lol
[3:38:16] <ATPsoldat> I mean, if you slam at a brick wall enough times, eventually it will break
[3:38:17] <+vaporousTippler> "Oh. I'm supposed to HIT him. I see."
[3:38:17] <hakita> I would recommend getting into melee range before shooting the railcannon so you can fill up your HP from it, but I don't know if woolie reads the chat
[3:38:22] <exnuart> second phase activates after some time whether he hits ground or not
[3:38:25] <andre11dr> He can do it ,it's only been like 2 hours
[3:38:26] <user_naim> lol
[3:38:31] <free2dayaccount> He falls in a straight line you don‚Äôt have to aim
[3:38:32] <Visorak6> You can hit 50% with railgun plus nailed minigun
[3:38:39] <Visorak6> Pretty easily
[3:38:41] <crimsonsaens> I thought it was 4 seconds
[3:38:54] <rReizs> man i'm positive he played doom and halo with aim assist
[3:38:55] <+charcharmunr> I thought it was like 12.
[3:38:57] <@Menitta> you < nothing
[3:39:00] <andre11dr> THERE'S A BOLT THAT SHOWS YOU
[3:39:01] <+zaworldo> no but you have it again
[3:39:07] <+zaworldo> its whatever
[3:39:12] <user_naim> @menitta not even mortal
[3:39:15] <ATPsoldat> LIGHTING SYMBOL = RAILGUN READY
[3:39:17] <crimsonsaens> My bad
[3:39:17] <+zaworldo> It's less damage?
[3:39:18] <free2dayaccount> Why not just do both?
[3:39:26] <@Solidus_113> @ATPsoldat he knows...
[3:39:31] <rReizs> imagine DMC without softlock
[3:39:32] <exnuart> oh he's got the DPS mindset
[3:39:36] <%jinking79> it like chip player having to press instead of holding button for the wall climb attack
[3:40:00] <+Superbro64> you *do* know capslock doesnt make you any more visible my friend
[3:40:04] <BlackermanZX> why is there a small gun in your inventory doodBait
[3:40:04] <+skylerpilot> while hes in juggle you can also freely get in close to absorb blood and heal
[3:40:17] <andre11dr> Stop trying to hit him and just hit him!
[3:40:32] <+wmeldrum> damn how long has he been doing this?
[3:40:36] <ATPsoldat> @Superbro64 it *does* actually.
[3:40:42] <andre11dr> like 2 hours i think
[3:40:45] <exnuart> @wmeldrum bout an hour
[3:40:52] <andre11dr> Oh
[3:40:55] <thelivingglitch307> Supreme

[3:41:05] <Josef_Stryker> Montreal doesn't have curfew anymore does it?
[3:41:05] <gryffinp> That was sort of working until he stood perfectly still until gabe hit him
[3:41:06] <Detectivemac9> definitely getting there
[3:41:07] <%OmegaWeltall> k...
[3:41:10] <BlackermanZX> you got him half health with that combo
[3:41:15] <exnuart> first hour was the rest of act 1
[3:41:18] <dds333a> progress, at least
[3:41:23] <+MosesUnspoken> This is the run
[3:41:51] <andre11dr> But what if....it's not
[3:42:04] <dds333a> yeah, guess not
[3:42:05] <ATPsoldat> can't wait for when hakita finishes the game. Love your work
[3:42:10] <user_naim> Maybe after two hours even a Dev May Cry
[3:42:17] <dds333a> one of these will, tho
[3:42:19] <IntenseNerdRage> Woolie is so focused on trying to not die I feel like he's not watching what gabriel is doing at all
[3:42:28] <T_Sasquatch> I'm a bit confused. Isn't the only way to heal is to be near the enemy .
[3:42:32] <ATPsoldat> yeah
[3:42:33] <gryffinp> Yes.
[3:42:33] <+zaworldo> yes
[3:42:41] <CoffeeSlice> ye
[3:43:29] <T_Sasquatch> Yea so why is woolie letting himself get to 20 hp and staying far back LUL
[3:43:29] <+ProfessorMorrigan> damn good 1
[3:43:31] <BlackermanZX> CLOSE
[3:43:32] <shinichizio> ough
[3:43:40] <lostallmyaccs> we getting there

[3:45:50] <+Hyphixsys> DAYUM
[3:45:50] <BlackermanZX> maybe stop shooting for a sec just to focus on dodging the 2nd phase
[3:45:56] <+mtlsars> DAMN
[3:45:58] <rReizs> the combat is secretly rhythm based
[3:46:04] <shinichizio> This doesn't seem like a 'stop shooting' type of game
[3:46:11] <+mtlsars> with that amount of attempt , it should Be Gabriel , Judge of PURGATORY
[3:46:12] <T_Sasquatch> Use time stop !
[3:46:30] <+Hyphixsys> @rReizs wasn't there a rhythm FPS? I think I saw it on Steam before LUL
[3:46:34] <gryffinp> It is absolutely a stop shooting game. you line up the good shots and fire once
[3:46:37] <%SveriSageAdvice> so if Woolie is supposed to stop shooting and focus on dodging, when is he supposed to shoot
[3:46:38] <BlackermanZX> i see he runs of out of dashes just after entering 2nd phase
[3:46:40] <andre11dr> Use a Hama spell surely his weak to it
[3:46:50] <@Solidus_113> Bullets Per Second was the rhythm FPS
[3:47:02] <brunoberserk> S P E E D
[3:47:04] <+mtlsars> exactly dre , Im kidding of course , like to rub salt on a gaming wound
[3:47:12] <+Hyphixsys> @Solidus_113 that's probably what I was thinking, lemme check it
[3:47:12] <IntenseNerdRage> Woolie is learning now
[3:47:19] <+zaworldo> why is he playing no healing hard mode thp
[3:47:24] <IntenseNerdRage> don't dodge haphazardly
[3:47:24] <gryffinp> @SveriSageAdvice when gabriel ltaunts
[3:47:39] <ATPsoldat> Because shotty doesn't exist, even when Gabe taunts

[3:51:16] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:51:20] <GetGianni> @Saltmeisterr hehe thanks yea getgiaGabrield
[3:51:22] <PrideOfFiddles> What a fight that was :D
[3:51:24] <+neoexogene> @GetGianni
[3:51:27] <+charcharmunr> "It's not fair, council, the machine is protagonist."
[3:51:28] <sir_nack> oh shit, did he finally do it?

[3:51:47] <GetGianni> @dds333a thank you getgiaFrockus
[3:51:55] <rReizs> dormammu i've come to bargain
[3:51:57] <heartlesshealer> if you think about it, angels are already treated as objects and slaves to God
[3:52:02] <+mtlsars> Reggie is Morgan Freemaning it
[3:52:04] <+neoexogene> getgiaFrockus
[3:52:07] <+vaporousTippler> "Oh come on. I beat him like 200 times!"
[3:52:14] <Lancaster_H> vergil 2
[3:52:14] <+charcharmunr> It's hard to take Gabe AS seriously after hearing all the Gianni shitposts, but still great work. @GetGianni
[3:52:22] <+Hyphixsys> don't tell me to fix my mistakes Kapp
[3:52:27] <+Superbro64> rip dis one gugy
[3:52:30] <+Superbro64> ouf
[3:52:39] <gryffinp> deep christian lore is that the worst part of hell the separation from God's grace
[3:52:39] <GetGianni> @charcharmunr yeah nothing was the same after the fans kicked him down a flight of stairs
[3:52:40] <dds333a> Reggie has his reading voice
[3:52:51] <+charcharmunr> I hope Gabe has a raw-as-fuck title for the next fight, compared to Judge of Hell.
[3:52:51] <Agami23> its such a fucking good voice
[3:52:52] <GetGianni> OVERTIME LUL
[3:52:54] <bonebagMEL> Yo das some metal ass writing
[3:52:55] <Agami23> and line
[3:52:56] <moonmintparadise> even metal will bleed - sounds so fucking badass
[3:52:57] <CoffeeSlice> 131 times did his job
[3:52:59] <%cobalt_phoenix_> LUL
[3:53:02] <gryffinp> IMPERFECT HATRED
[3:53:04] <+Bob_Tom> you cant fight that which lives again and again

[3:53:09] <SheefEatsBeef> YEYEYEYEYEYEYE
[3:53:09] <+Hyphixsys> DUN DUN DUN
[3:53:16] <Lancaster_H> 15$ /hr btw
[3:53:17] <%AlteisenReiseZ> That's a GOOOOOD TITLE
[3:53:18] <ZeeJiggle> Gabriel has to kill you indefinitely, you only need to win once.
[3:53:18] <PMda2nd> nah didn't count, one L too mamy
[3:53:19] <dds333a> everyone's a critic
[3:53:25] <+mtlsars> WYCLEF!
[3:53:29] <b_ikki> Act II "soon" FeelsBadMan
[3:53:30] <freefa> OK so cybergrind right?
[3:53:30] <%justcallmebobplease> Aaaaand now the dev's hope to see Woolie hit chapter end makes sense.
[3:53:32] <perennialastronaut> if u want to kill @getgianni for voicing ur pain ill allow it, i nearly did and im his fukkin wife
[3:53:38] <GetGianni> YOUR VERGIL IS ON THE CLOCK LUL I love that
[3:53:40] <AngryAsian5> Poor guy didn't have the ability to restart after death
[3:53:44] <free2dayaccount> Cybergrind!
[3:53:44] <+Hyphixsys> @b_ikki TM Kappa
[3:53:48] <+neoexogene> Gabriel's voice actor was freaking out to see you fighting Gabriel
[3:53:51] <thelivingglitch307> @ZeeJiggle almost like the setup for a video game...
[3:53:53] <dds333a> Like crusty, decaying Vergil
[3:53:58] <+charcharmunr> @GetGianni It's gonna make his eventual refight (which I assume he'll get) even harder to take seriously when I'm just like "Man you're just the community punching bag I can't even".
[3:54:01] <ZeeJiggle> @thelivingglitch307 awmg ur rite
[3:54:01] <PMda2nd> it takes two, tries for gabriel
[3:54:13] <+Superbro64> if gabe newell's THAT hard, I wonder what Act II will be like
[3:54:17] <+Bob_Tom> thats only episode 1. im scared what the rest has in store
[3:54:20] <hakita> Sacrifice your Father's light for more time on the clock
[3:54:27] <gryffinp> I kind of hope that gabriel's future appearances are explicitly pathetic
[3:54:28] <+Superbro64> but then again, Woolie was gamepadding with no auto aim
[3:54:29] <Agami23> its got auto aim for people with these issues
[3:54:37] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah I feel the same with fighting games
[3:54:38] <+Superbro64> so props to sbfpDattebayo
[3:54:43] <+MugenSandan> Welcome to learning fighting games Woolie
[3:54:45] <+QueequegTheater> I tried BPM but holy shit it felt bad
[3:54:46] <andre11dr> Well you did forget to play it as well
[3:54:50] <Visorak6> You might want to play on a higher difficulty in the future but with auto-aim so you can focus on movement and style
[3:54:51] <+charcharmunr> @gryffinp Like he just shows up and gets swatted aside by a more intimidating boss?
[3:54:52] <lostallmyaccs> Pad is a real debuff tbf
[3:55:01] <Lancaster_H> thats what you get for not getting into counter strike
[3:55:05] <$arcielardor> use a fight stick
[3:55:05] <gryffinp> @charcharmunr like he shows up and then gets bopped by V2
[3:55:06] <+charcharmunr> @QueequegTheater BPM's great when you're really into it, but that can be tricky.
[3:55:07] <GetGianni> a lot of folks use the auto aim and the game doesn't punish you for it at all
[3:55:13] <antonicknight55> Woolie studied the sword, not the gun
[3:55:16] <%kyh9> Woolie, you've gotten WAY better at FPS games
[3:55:19] <dds333a> @lancaster_h KEKW
[3:55:19] <+charcharmunr> @gryffinp Or just like, a Cerberus but bigger swats him aside.
[3:55:20] <%kyh9> Ultrakill is just ridiculous
[3:55:21] <%Chichen> its also just an insanely tough fight woolie
[3:55:21] <Hammatime8> Use a racing wheel Kappa
[3:55:23] <andre11dr> Oh here we go Woolie wishes this was 3rd person what a new take
[3:55:36] <+QueequegTheater> @charcharmunr or they could just let me fire the gun like a gun instead of a drum set
[3:55:38] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah it's points in different stats, that's just how it is
[3:55:41] <+Superbro64> so what we need is a ultrakill for fighting games you say? Kappa
[3:55:42] <+QueequegTheater> Dumb gimmick
[3:55:44] <dds333a> yeah, Specialization, and all that
[3:55:45] <+Superbro64> That sounds sick, tbh
[3:55:47] <%kyh9> Woolie, do NOT be down on yourself. You're not bad at FPS games anymore, this fight is just BALLZ hard
[3:55:50] <+charcharmunr> @QueequegTheater I really like that gimmick, but hey.
[3:55:51] <GarrisonPrime> this kills the woolie
[3:55:54] <GetGianni> oh yeah also I think most people totally take like hours on that fight
[3:55:54] <lostallmyaccs> I see what you mean man
[3:56:03] <Karhax> Woolie is also using a weird peripheral
[3:56:07] <bonebagMEL> It is a great fight
[3:56:08] <%AyotoCorp> Maybe the hybrid controller/mouse setup should make a comeback.
[3:56:11] <Louie_Salmon> Also yeah this fight is legit hard, I think it took me 2 hours so honestly that was good
[3:56:12] <+neoexogene> @WoolieVersus Gabriel's VA is a big fan btw
[3:56:12] <%MooseIsGoose> I would be the best there was if I could do better says woolie
[3:56:16] <b_ikki> literally beat him tho
[3:56:17] <+Bob_Tom> yeah no that fight really is tough af you arent bad at all
[3:56:17] <%cobalt_phoenix_> dude this fight is rough don't even stress
[3:56:22] <%jinking79> same with fighting trials
[3:56:24] <andre11dr> Yeah it was like an hour and half that's not bad
[3:56:34] <GetGianni> @neoexogene don't worry too much about spamming him with it, though I appreciate the effort getgiaFrockus
[3:56:35] <dds333a> Also, like people said, it's also pretty extreme
[3:56:43] <@Menitta> I hope you dont have the same trouble as Ghostrunner. There's a bit of that feeling in that game
[3:56:57] <BlackermanZX> Get Into FPS Games when StinkyGlitch
[3:56:59] <+Superbro64> There's a first person spellcasting game, forget the name
[3:57:04] <dds333a> But especially the big robots
[3:57:05] <%justcallmebobplease> Woolie did you just call Mirror's Edge an FPS? WTF, man, other genres exist that it's much better fit to.
[3:57:13] <+neoexogene> @GetGianni You're right i'll stop, didn't realize i was spamming
[3:57:23] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Menitta dude the last part of ghostrunner almost made me stop especially the end
[3:57:27] <Visorak6> It's time gated chapters
[3:57:30] <%kyh9> Any Disco Elysium this week?
[3:57:36] <Karhax> I've never heard of anyone getting RSI in their left keyboard hand, it's always the mouse hand
[3:57:36] <dds333a> @superbro64 old Id stuff, or new?
[3:57:39] <%MooseIsGoose> I am not into FPS games like I should be. I need them to have a gimmick like this
[3:57:48] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah some minor gameplay things have changed but it's essentially just content coming out
[3:57:49] <Agami23> chapter 1 isnt done yet. 2 secret levels not in
[3:57:54] <andre11dr> Disco Elysium is NEXT WEEK
[3:57:58] <tukds> Try Luminous Avenger iX it has one the best platformer movement options I've played in years
[3:58:02] <+Superbro64> @dds333a old, I remember TB having a video on it
[3:58:03] <dds333a> Cause Heretic and Hexen are fantasy Doom
[3:58:09] <+neoexogene> Chapter 2 is still a little while away i think
[3:58:12] <+Nekolaius> Dont forget each Act's "P-Level" that unlocks when you get a P Rank in each stage
[3:58:16] <@Menitta> @cobalt_phoenix_ for me it was that tower level
[3:58:17] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1376753284791296000?s=19
[3:58:22] <@Menitta> I
[3:58:25] <dds333a> @superbro64 yeah, then maybe one of those two
[3:58:27] <+Nekolaius> which is literally SSSing the stage without dying or checkpointing
[3:58:33] <gryffinp> how's reggie with fps
[3:58:35] <free2dayaccount> No cybergrind I guess
[3:58:38] <dds333a> Oh, side cam
[3:58:42] <@Menitta> I'm glad I stuck through it though. Ghostrunner was one of my favorite games last year
[3:58:45] <%Namillus> So Ultrakill has a Perfect rank nice
[3:58:48] <@Solidus_113> commentary end
[3:58:54] <thelivingglitch307> back to the Woolie hole?
[3:58:55] <+Superbro64> "good game good" "me skill not good" sbfpDattebayo
[3:58:56] <dds333a> do it
[3:58:58] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[3:58:59] <GetGianni> "OWNED, MACHINE. OWNED." - getgiaGabrield
[3:59:01] <Lancaster_H> pwnd
[3:59:07] <PrideOfFiddles> LUL
[3:59:08] <dds333a> NOT EVEN MORTAL
[3:59:12] <tukds> Which 13 sentinals are behind woolie
[3:59:15] <%kyh9> Gabriel might as well have said "Get fucked Woolie"
[3:59:17] <+Nekolaius> Act 1's P Level isnt implemented yet, but Hatika just put up a music trailer on his youtube
[3:59:20] <+neoexogene> getgiaGabrield "GET OWNED GOPRO"
[3:59:20] <%cobalt_phoenix_> LUL
[3:59:22] <@Menitta> lmao
[3:59:22] <bonebagMEL> @GetGianni oh we getting previews of quips? n i c e

[3:59:30] <%Namillus> @tukds Miwako and Nenji
[3:59:31] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[3:59:37] <+Superbro64> I'll take the controller, watch me :)
[3:59:47] <andre11dr> Man i would love if Heretic or Hexen got a Doom Eternal style reboot
[3:59:54] <%kyh9> Disco Elysium?
[3:59:58] <Blank9> ghostrunner rules
[3:59:58] <PMda2nd> cool game , take it easy
[4:00:05] <@Menitta> Ghostrunner is real short. You could get through that game in 2 sessions
[4:00:05] <+mtlsars> Much love to you 2 , thanks for the entertainment
[4:00:13] <dds333a> It takes tomorrow
[4:00:16] <%Javaa01> @andre11dr Too bad those are forever stuck in the Activision IP utility closet
[4:00:20] <+Jiggisnipe> Disco is coming later after he makes the intro and other prep stuff
[4:00:24] <Josef_Stryker> In conclusion: Fuck Origin
[4:00:30] <%AyotoCorp> @WoolieVersus Ghostrunner's a two-stream game tops, so it's easy to bang out
[4:00:30] <hakita> @Nekolaius It's almost done. I'm basically just waiting for some assets from other people, so it'll probably be coming out in a week or 2
[4:00:32] <@Solidus_113> Ghostrunner is another FPS speedrunning game, it also requires maximum attention
[4:00:45] <+Bob_Tom> ghost runner is also very sick
[4:00:57] <dds333a> @solidus_113 that it does
[4:00:58] <+Bob_Tom> its platforming
[4:00:59] <GetGianni> @hakita yeah cool game, weird VA though getgiaGabrield Kappa
[4:01:01] <%cobalt_phoenix_> nooooo
[4:01:03] <+Nekolaius> @Nekolaius I guess i need to start P-Ranking all the stages then... Thanks for the news!
[4:01:04] <b_ikki> kinda like katana zero
[4:01:05] <@Menitta> No you are killing everything on sight
[4:01:05] <%kyh9> zipping
[4:01:05] <someyounguy1> ghost runner is acrobatic
[4:01:07] <%AyotoCorp> Melee fighting
[4:01:07] <%kyh9> running
[4:01:07] <+Bob_Tom> platforming with instadeath combat
[4:01:09] <Hammatime8> You'
[4:01:10] <hakita> @GetGianni Foolishness Gianni, Foolishness
[4:01:10] <perennialastronaut> @haikita oH??? POG
[4:01:11] <Blank9> 1st person katana zero
[4:01:11] <%kyh9> Ghost Running
[4:01:11] <penitentpendant> Acrobatic Combat
[4:01:12] <%Javaa01> @WoolieVersus First person Hotline Miami with more parkour
[4:01:13] <bonebagMEL> It's 3d hotline miami
[4:01:15] <@Menitta> It is first person Katana Zero
[4:01:16] <@Solidus_113> yeah katana zero
[4:01:16] <%cobalt_phoenix_> imagine mirrors edge but with a bit more aim based combat
[4:01:19] <dds333a> Moving and killing
[4:01:22] <+skylerpilot> 1 hit kill action puzzles
[4:01:24] <+Superbro64> platformy shinobi ps2-ish
[4:01:35] <dds333a> never stop moving, really
[4:01:40] <Hammatime8> Stealth is pretty much not thing in Ghost Runner
[4:01:41] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh yeah katana 0 is a better description
[4:01:42] <someyounguy1> titanfall 2 with a sword
[4:02:00] <%Javaa01> It's routing
[4:02:03] <Brandon__Brando> stealth till the big bang
[4:02:16] <@Menitta> Yeah that's a good word for it
[4:02:27] <@Menitta> I'm gonna reinstall Ghostrunner tonight
[4:02:59] <Blank9> coil whine is a bitch
[4:03:09] <hakita> I sent Woolie a twitter DM asking about why he chose not to use auto-aim. I hope he checks his twitter DMs lol
[4:03:21] <dds333a> We need our service to get a piece of the pie
[4:03:28] <+Superbro64> I looove rayman legends, but uplay is DansGame
[4:03:29] <%ekodrop> @hakita he ain't gonna check that yo
[4:04:14] <dds333a> Well, I guess he saw it here
[4:04:19] <hakita> Lucky me
[4:04:20] <gryffinp> wait did he ACTUALLY not think about it
[4:04:24] <PrideOfFiddles> VS Auto-Aim
[4:04:26] <%ekodrop> lucky lucky
[4:04:27] <gryffinp> I assumed it was an actual choice
[4:04:32] <@Solidus_113> auto aim affects the coin iirc
[4:04:34] <Visorak6> It was on last time because you couldnt hit the coins
[4:04:35] <%cobalt_phoenix_> you used auto aim but it removed the ability to aim at the coins i think
[4:04:42] <%Irridium> didn't he turn it off because it messed with the coin?
[4:04:46] <dds333a> WoolievsNailgun
[4:04:47] <gryffinp> I'm quite sure he auto-aimed v2 to death
[4:04:50] <Dante_Namikaze1> woolieVS Auto-aim
[4:04:56] <+Superbro64> Since you beat gabe without auto aim, you could always play offline WITH auto aim, just for comparison @WoolieVersus
[4:04:58] <hakita> Options are saved differently so they don't automatically carry over between PCs
[4:05:07] <Louie_Salmon> Damn that's some real hard mode then
[4:05:11] <rReizs> it makes controllers actually passable for fps, speaking as an MKB user
[4:05:22] <@Solidus_113> Gabe beat on real gamer mode
[4:05:22] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:05:33] <Visorak6> Personally I would recommend auto-aim on + difficulty bump to compensate
[4:05:37] <+zaworldo> you mean the coin he didnt use
[4:05:49] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @andre11dr
[4:05:53] <dds333a> Chat will find something anyway
[4:05:54] <+zaworldo> Gabe hard mode no easy mode unlock good shit
[4:06:06] <@Menitta> It's funny because people were really wanting you to so....its a dunk regardless
[4:06:08] <Louie_Salmon> Woolie did a big win
[4:06:10] <dds333a> It's fun
[4:06:20] <+Superbro64> You did prove that you can beat gabe w/o aa, so thats neat at least
[4:06:27] <@Menitta> "WE DOUBLE DUNK"
[4:06:45] <eloweezyweezle> hiii
[4:06:47] <+Superbro64> reminder that max sat on bloodblorne ludwig boss for 7-9 hours straight way back when
[4:06:51] <+Superbro64> not really the worse
[4:06:52] <@Solidus_113> that actually might b eit
[4:06:57] <%KetsuoTaberu> It's definitely possible
[4:07:40] <%Javaa01> @WoolieVersus Remember, the 3080 Founders can draw up to 368W under full load
[4:07:54] <%Javaa01> It is a beefy card
