[0:02:13] <%CappuccinoGuil> @generalcanada99 one of the few times I've streamed in my life was JSR on Steam and... it was a nightmare. Glad to hear Future feels better to play though!
[0:02:17] <Arqartur0> ooooh nice!
[0:02:18] <%Juriasu> I think the problem is it just doesn't emulate well
[0:02:18] <+sandwich_jones> future is soooo good
[0:02:20] <@Solidus_113> Future is still Xbox locked yes
[0:02:37] <miucsa51> There is a tone of good japanese games that are trapped in the xbox NotLikeThis

[0:02:55] <+sandwich_jones> it emulates ok on pc. it was also on 360. it still has frame issues in the bigger levels
[0:02:55] <+sputnikbites> @kiwamikiryu future has limited emulation I believe, but yeah can’t otherwise be played outside of OG xbox

[0:07:14] <+Nintokis> It's called the puberty pyramid in the show
[0:07:15] <@Menitta> in season 0 yes
[0:07:16] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> "Here's something you might like, from the thing you didn't watch"

[0:07:40] <%tank7013> Man I would love a show that was just early Yugioh
[0:07:41] <+Mrbaconator> there was gun violence
[0:07:43] <derap41> The shadow rrealm means death
[0:07:43] <%NickHatesSnow> even when it was a card game people die
[0:07:45] <+FlameWarden> Omg Atem was super evil I loved it
[0:07:46] <@Menitta> all I like is Seto Kaiba. The original Sigma
[0:07:48] <Ramasama13> a guy burned to death
[0:07:51] <%Lion_kun> Yugi literally doused a guy with vodka and set him aflame.
[0:08:01] <%seydaq> the anime flava flav neck chain

[0:10:02] <leith_aziz> @WoolieVersus : Not sure if you discussed this before, but thoughts oon T7 and SFV likely reaching their end by now?
[0:10:09] <zenith0111> Season 0 made no sesne
[0:10:18] <+FlameWarden> Was the name Atem conceptually established in season 0 or were they planning to keep it as nameless pharoh before the card game?
[0:10:35] <iacus_> Was there or are there plans for a Netflix Bebop spoilercast?
[0:10:55] <leith_aziz> @iacus_ Check the recent podcast video on Youtube
[0:11:00] <zenith0111> Season 0 Kaiba was a real evil stinker
[0:11:04] <%justmildlilac> @flamewarden I might be way wrong but I think in 0 they always just called him The Pharoah
[0:11:08] <iacus_> cheers
[0:11:08] <%Juriasu> @iacus_ this emote is all you need to know woolieYIKES
[0:11:16] <iacus_> haha

[0:58:53] <ShadowArcangel> So 2 Mello is just a fan doing a fan album? No relation to Jet Set, they just thought it would be cool to do a fan album/tribute?
[0:58:55] <%Dapper_Cactuar> I'm redownloading Jet Set Radio now. This hit me right in the nostalgia super hard
[0:58:59] <ShadowArcangel> That sounds pretty cool!

[0:59:03] <$ArCielArDor> Wait is this like a remake of the game?
[0:59:07] <Shad0wTag> @ShadowArcangel Yup and this is the 2nd album!
[0:59:14] <+Jiggisnipe> @ShadowArcangel yea he did two
[0:59:14] <$ArCielArDor> because I don't remember this being so jank?
[0:59:22] <%hereiam407> Its the power of the PS5

[0:59:38] <%swesterly> which makes it incredibly impressive

[1:00:49] <%Indigo_Automaton> @Rhythmaxed It plays super well, I was suprised
[1:00:50] <Lavrohas> vrchat is free and you do not need a vr headset. when you get in, look up JSR Festival in the worlds.
[1:00:53] <+Tuffty> Is 2Mello involved with Bombrush Cyberfunk? Cause if not...he should be
[1:00:53] <critfumble_> BoneZone
[1:00:55] <@Menitta> the tagging was QTEs
[1:01:05] <@Menitta> its so much more fun in Future imo
[1:01:13] <Shad0wTag> @Tuffty No idea yet but Hideki Naganuma is
[1:01:14] <+Shady_Zaku> Man I gotta play the games, haven't had a chance to yet

[1:01:34] <%Dapper_Cactuar> I wish Future was on steam so bad
[1:01:35] <+MxZxMxN> @Tuffty no but hideki naganuma is which is who 2mello was inspired by to make the tribute style music
[1:01:36] <speximillian> Can you imagine if there had been a JSR on Wii or Switch, motion controls for the cans?
[1:01:41] <+FuqBoiSlim> This is my fucking track turn it up shofuMillyrock

[1:30:01] <Duskendawn> Oh yeahhh that fox news boss
[1:30:01] <SixthShinx> This reminds me a bit of the Mario Sunshine bonus levels, as well as a late game FF13 area that's in Dissiai 012
[1:30:11] <%Indigo_Automaton> Almost got it
[1:30:16] <+OrangeMDT> Wait, why isn’t Woolie celebrating Thanksgiving :0 /s
[1:30:20] <SainEdge> @critfumble_  oh yes, thats what i was thinking LUL
[1:30:32] <Blak3_Nikos> yeaaaaah
[1:30:33] <odiz395> as anyone thought that woolie's R63 avatar remids the Marina from splatoon 2 ?
[1:30:37] <velgaduere> one more one more last one last one
[1:30:39] <zenith0111> Motion sickness in a videogame?
[1:30:40] <+Jiggisnipe> what?
[1:30:42] <leith_aziz> pickyFocus pickyFocus pickyFocus
[1:30:44] <critfumble_> rayman 3 scared the shit out of me as a kid
[1:30:46] <%Indigo_Automaton> It's actually a common misconception that people expereince motion sickness in VR
[1:30:47] <+Shoryo_Tori> Canadians have a different thanksgiving day
[1:30:48] <@Solidus_113> POISON JAM 2 SourPls
[1:30:52] <shooziii> Poison Jam 2 is the best!
[1:30:52] <velgaduere> HIGHWAY robbery
[1:30:57] <%Indigo_Automaton> It's actually called VR sickness specifically
[1:30:59] <Shad0wTag> POISON JAM PART II
[1:30:59] <Binary7> I don't wanna see no police man, I just wanna do dope shit with my friends
[1:31:02] <Shad0wTag> LETS GOOOOO
[1:31:08] <%waltzqueen> POISON JAM YEAH
[1:31:11] <californaya> yeah, Canada T-Day was last month, right?
[1:31:17] <leith_aziz> Understandable
[1:31:24] <eelwoman> Fucking Poison Jam
[1:31:29] <eelwoman> Love this song so much
[1:31:36] <+patrickng714> motion blur as well?
[1:31:55] <%andrewofbob> Camera shake must be handled sensitively
[1:32:13] <%Juriasu> narrow fov makes it feel like you get to close to things so usually just setting fov higher would probably help a lot
[1:32:17] <zenith0111> Staring a 3D physics based platformer and a Flat 2D monitor
[1:32:33] <critfumble_> ayayaya
[1:33:34] <Duskendawn> Motion blur messes me up bad, I always turn it off if possible
[1:33:35] <+FirebirdXR> fuck gravity and momentum XD
[1:33:41] <%Indigo_Automaton> So the difference between motion sickness and VR sickness is that motion sickness is induced by physical sensations of motion, whereass VR sickness is induced by the disconnect between what your eyes are seeing and what your brain is feeling
[1:34:03] <zenith0111> Thats all motion sickness
[1:34:13] <@Menitta> I definitely experience VR Sickness
[1:34:22] <%CaptainBeird> acdc's greatest hits!
[1:34:26] <@Menitta> thats why I use the teleport option with stuff like Alyx
[1:34:39] <zenith0111> That description of VR sickness is literally just motion sickness
[1:34:43] <Shad0wTag> CHAINSAW
[1:34:44] <Shad0wTag> FUNK
[1:34:49] <%Indigo_Automaton> Non-virtual reality simulator sickness tends to be characterized by oculomotor disturbances, whereas virtual reality sickness tends to be characterized by disorientation

[1:35:52] <Shad0wTag> @ChrisM341 Entirely possible it's a sample
[1:36:02] <@Menitta> i need to get the first 2 Mello JSR album on vinyl now
[1:36:04] <%sputnikbites> A wall jump is probably enough
[1:36:11] <+FirebirdXR> though I am hope we get some actual JSRF gameplay one we're done
[1:36:25] <%yusefHD> watching this in 160p is a fucking trip, let me tell you chat
[1:36:26] <%Indigo_Automaton> @zenith0111 It's a bit more complicated on that but the wikipedia page for VR sickness would explain it better than I can

[1:47:40] <@Menitta> THEY HAD THE FUCKING CHANCE AND BLEW IT
[1:47:48] <ChrisM341> Because Its not Sonic or Yakuza
[1:47:49] <Estwilde> It's crazy man
[1:47:58] <%kinetikpaws> its all so tiresome
[1:48:00] <+DangerSloth87> They said something like "We're too old to know what's cool anymore"
[1:48:03] <Estwilde> They own all of Naganuma's music for it
[1:48:07] <PanosZync7> They said because of the music licenses for JSRF. Dunno why no JSR 3 tho
[1:48:11] <velgaduere> because they don't wanna work with Funky Unkle anymore
[1:48:14] <+Jiggisnipe> maybe they lost the original version of JSRF
[1:48:14] <%brisk_dacat> Give us a rubber duck
[1:48:14] <SixthShinx> They had a poll that told them people WANT Jet Set Radio
[1:48:16] <Shad0wTag> Microsoft has to be able to convince them
[1:48:16] <velgaduere> he's gone full meme
[1:48:19] <Estwilde> They don't need to license any music
[1:48:21] <Duskendawn> Kiryu in monkey ball LUL
[1:48:26] <PanosZync7> I hope Bomb Rush Cyberfunk will shake them up
[1:48:31] <@Menitta> that's actually it. Rn, they just do Sonic, RGG, or Hatsune Miku.
[1:48:33] <Shad0wTag> They just made give 4k 60 support for some of their games already
[1:48:41] <THELAW3D4> Sonic atleast gets stuff, he's got a sequel to his move and a new game coming
[1:48:42] <Estwilde> I sure hope Bomb Rush Cyberfunk is good too. Everything I've seen looks promising at least
[1:48:42] <%CaptainBeird> they had 2 levels in sonic and sega all stars racing transformed and that's probably the biggest thing they've done
[1:48:48] <technodribble> I was really confused by this when I first joined since I didn't realize it was VRChat
[1:48:54] <@Menitta> I'm so amped for Bomb Rush
[1:49:10] <@Menitta> oooh nice
[1:49:11] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:49:11] <%waltzqueen> @Menitta big same get hype
[1:49:15] <Shad0wTag> @Menitta Imagine 2Mello music on that man
[1:49:16] <%swesterly> Bomb Rush is our last hope
[1:49:18] <ValKiryuSonicEX> @Shad0wTag while I found the album on Spotify, still bought the album on Bandcamp to support them.
[1:49:24] <agustorm123> At least we got a reference in monkey ball

[1:50:03] <zenith0111> @sputnikbites Tbh its because Jet Set is outclassed...
[1:50:10] <Estwilde> VRChat has some crazy stuff in it
[1:50:13] <@Menitta> I just tried this and yo its fun as fuck
[1:50:15] <Shad0wTag> @sputnikbites I swear all the old JP dev's are like this. Capcom and SEGA are both like this
[1:50:15] <Estwilde> There's a whole Final Fantasy quest world
[1:50:17] <Binary7> Wanna use me don't worry bout fuckin with me
[1:50:19] <ValKiryuSonicEX> Also, I think the Jet Set Radio re-release bombing also might have hurt the series chances, all that effort to get most of the songs.
[1:50:19] <Binary7> SourPls
[1:50:22] <PanosZync7> Has Woolie checked out JSRFMP?

[1:50:56] <DiscoDur0> That's what stream cam in VRChat is for baby!
[1:50:59] <Lavrohas> Jet Set Radio is also on sale for 1$ USD on steam right now!!
[1:51:00] <%sputnikbites> @zenith0111 by? of course all the game mechanics have been refined and progressed since its day… but the game mechanics aren’t the only reason people loved it
[1:51:00] <%waltzqueen> this make sme wanna roller blade
[1:51:05] <%Indigo_Automaton> It's so much fun
[1:51:06] <rosemon5001> you need to talk in crime language to SEGA if you want to make it like this GAME MONEY MONEY US CRIME MONEY MONEY
[1:51:12] <+FuqBoiSlim> @valkiryusonicex yeah its crazy impressive that the remaster is only missing ONE song
[1:51:19] <Estwilde> catJAM
[1:51:21] <zenith0111> @sputnikbites And thats why its niche
[1:51:29] <Binary7> THE BARS
[1:51:43] <@Menitta> I need to buy these albums on vinyl.
[1:52:01] <ValKiryuSonicEX> @FuqBoiSlim really I thought it was all but 2 or three, which is still impressive because it's almost everything from all three region releases.
[1:52:03] <@Menitta> ooooh close
[1:52:27] <%waltzqueen> DONT WORRY BOUT FUCKIN WIT ME
[1:52:32] <%sputnikbites> @zenith0111 what… is… the argument? Fun unique thing people love. People even willing to make a new game FOR sega.
[1:52:33] <Estwilde> @ValKiryuSonicEX That may have been, but damn I think JSRF always controlled better than JSR since you didnt need to stop and do motions for sprays
[1:52:42] <Binary7> RAVE SHIT THO!
[1:52:45] <Duskendawn> I'm barely watching the stream lol, just chillin to the music while doing other things
[1:52:54] <THELAW3D4> The characters in the FF7 BR don't do cool anime poses while shoot, sadness.
[1:52:56] <Estwilde> @ValKiryuSonicEX So they brought back the wrong one if they wanted to ease folks back in
[1:53:12] <+FuqBoiSlim> @valkiryusonicex yeah, Yappie Feet is the only song missing and that's from the PAL version I think
[1:53:12] <@Menitta> This album also gives me Anarchy Reigns vibes
[1:53:14] <Binary7> The music video for this one is something

[1:54:36] <Estwilde> PogChamp
[1:54:38] <ValKiryuSonicEX> @Estwilde True, but I think JSRF's biggest hurdle is getting it running on other platforms other than the OG Xbox, which had terrible record keeping on it.  Considering the HD release's performance, they might have figured not worth the effort for low sales.  Not saying it's right, but it seems like a plausible reason.

[2:16:27] <%Indigo_Automaton> @kinetikpaws Imagine a conversation between those narrators
[2:16:27] <SolidusA> it' s about how overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer

[2:19:15] <%Maloane> you can play the intro at the chapter select
[2:19:17] <Xaeveax> NotLikeThis
[2:19:25] <ChoculaUltra> Reggie has embraced the chaos.
[2:19:30] <%scrumbotime> Let Reggie play so he can just get perfect dodges
[2:19:37] <zenith0111> @choculaultra DD1 was about unraveling the mystery of your ancestor and what he discovered beneath his estate and killed himswlf out of the horrors he unleashed
[2:19:46] <+Orcapugs> Dokapon revenge for Reggie
[2:20:09] <ChoculaUltra> @zenith0111 ah I see - so the horrors weren't contained to the estate/hamlet after the events of DD1?
[2:20:12] <Arqartur0> ooooh
[2:20:18] <Zineta> LUL
[2:20:19] <Xaeveax> Stream luck
[2:20:21] <ChoculaUltra> or is the world in DD just generally fucked
[2:20:30] <+Orcapugs> John’s incoming
[2:20:34] <the_420_dachshund> Whatever happens will be entertaining
[2:20:36] <%CaptainBeird> chokest chungeon
[2:20:43] <zenith0111> @choculaultra DD1 ending pretty much says theres no hope and DD2 is like game over/bad storyline lol
[2:20:44] <%Afterman_> streamer cam blocking the UI
[2:20:46] <+Shady_Zaku> You said the forbidden phrase, prepare to be BLOWN OUT ON STREAM doodScrub doodScrub
[2:20:49] <%Afterman_> but i think its fine
[2:20:56] <ChoculaUltra> @zenith0111 oh thats rad as hell LUL
[2:21:13] <rattletrap69> Paracelsus 👀
[2:21:27] <ChoculaUltra> continuations to games following the previous entry's bad end is like crack cocaine to me
[2:21:31] <LegsSama> Ayo yo
[2:21:51] <Arqartur0> I don;t have 2, but this makes me want to replay 1 so bad.
[2:22:10] <Blank9> @ChoculaUltra Shadow Hearts Covenant's my favorite of that
[2:22:15] <Estwilde> @ChoculaUltra oh yeah. everything DD is about making the best of an ever worsening situation :D
[2:22:30] <zhenthrim213> @Arqartur0 1 is  still its own game this doesnt replace it which is awesome
[2:22:40] <%Th3SmartAlec> point blank shot is so good
[2:22:47] <sirrice77> @Arqartur0 might as well. If it's a little stale there's mods. There's not just tiddy mods
[2:22:51] <Arqartur0> Great!
[2:23:16] <Arqartur0> @Arqartur0 I've seen the Warhammer Fantasy mods, and I want those.
[2:23:21] <the_420_dachshund> I’m on a hiiiighwayman to hell
[2:23:33] <+Shady_Zaku> @zenith0111 OOF
[2:24:00] <%Th3SmartAlec> just got in, chat what level profile we at?
[2:24:06] <%Th3SmartAlec> nevermind
[2:24:06] <ChoculaUltra> glad my boy Dismas canonically survived the hell that was DD1
[2:24:20] <sirrice77> @Arqartur0 They're probably just in the steam workshop, it's really simple to mod your game. Just remember to have all the mods you want when you start a game and pay attention to load order if it matters
[2:24:41] <zenith0111> Dismas is the ancestors descendant I believe. Dismas is like the canon protag right?
[2:24:52] <zenith0111> He has lots of lore in DD1
[2:25:06] <%thetunnelhomer> @zenith0111 No, he is just some guy
[2:25:24] <sirrice77> I've never heard of that unless that was added in DD2. Dismas is just the highwayman you start with in DD1 along with Reynauld the crusader
[2:25:25] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:25:26] <ChoculaUltra> goddamn that was a bar
[2:25:33] <Duskendawn> Is there a date for DD2 on consoles yet or still TBD?
[2:25:36] <+Shady_Zaku> Feeeed me Seyymouuuuur
[2:25:43] <zhenthrim213> Wayne speaks only in BARS
[2:25:43] <viridianowl> Both DD games have bars for days
[2:25:53] <zenith0111> @sirrice77 Did you get the notes in dungeons?
[2:25:58] <ChoculaUltra> I'd pay to hear him read out my grocery list LUL
[2:26:15] <%waltzqueen> It's BARSday Reggie
[2:26:23] <zenith0111> Reynauld and Dismas have extended lore
[2:26:26] <%Th3SmartAlec> for Wayne June goodness, please listen to The Shunned House on Youtube
[2:26:33] <sirrice77> @zenith0111 I did but i honestly don't remember all of them. So maybe i just missed whatever you're talking about or forgot it

[4:22:45] <%Th3SmartAlec> Meanwhile that Crit trinket just sitting there
[4:22:50] <Make_me_mad> I really don't like the combo of enemies having death's door and the 5 round limit. Either alone I'd be willing to accept, but damn.

[4:27:55] <%Th3SmartAlec> This must have just been added?
[4:28:04] <royb2> in DD1 death blow resist trinkets were generally not worth it as you'd dont want to rely on a dice roll on dying
[4:28:08] <lovlyvibes> A strange academy investigating the arcane? REMEMBER THE ADAGE
[4:28:10] <lovlyvibes> Fear it

[4:33:19] <%Th3SmartAlec> Back 2 are dead
[4:33:51] <%RealThiele> the barks and animations imo take too long. it makes the runs drag
[4:34:05] <%Th3SmartAlec> @RealThiele Agreeed
[4:34:08] <+mechslayer71> for the relationships, yeah, it's a common complaint
[4:34:32] <+mechslayer71> hellion does work too
[4:34:46] <%Th3SmartAlec> @RealThiele Also, every animation has this minuscule pause at the end that feels like forever
[4:34:47] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1463039561215401988?t=hxoyuIobXdvYv38oBvV5_Q&s=19

[4:35:24] <%Infernal_Dalek> Plan 2B, send in fat-assed android
[4:35:39] <CrowbarFacelift> Is there still a penalty for lingering in fights to heal and de-stress? I remember the first game had something like that.
[4:35:40] <+Shady_Zaku> FUCKING AUDREY
[4:35:52] <dweebenheimer20> i didnt know there was a part 2 :O
[4:35:55] <%RealThiele> @CrowbarFacelift fights have time limits very often it shows in the top right
[4:36:15] <CrowbarFacelift> ah
[4:36:16] <%Th3SmartAlec> ...what?
[4:36:19] <+pectusumbra> ounce of prevention but you have to level it
[4:36:23] <+DGenerator> Happy Latesgiving to Americans in chat, happy Thursday to Canadians/rest of the world
[4:36:24] <yukichocomilk> it's ounce of prevention but you need to upgrade
[4:36:24] <Saltmeisterr> upgraded ounce of prevention
[4:36:25] <+Shady_Zaku> Magnesium rain?
[4:36:41] <Afrosamasenpai> That's buffed Ounce of Preventions
[4:36:46] <Afrosamasenpai> Which you sadly don't have
[4:36:49] <Saltmeisterr> upgrade OoP is op
[4:36:52] <yukichocomilk> should unequip that stab move that she can't even use
[4:36:58] <OblivionSword1> we'll make do

[4:38:52] <whiteblacklight74> we scrubquotes
[4:38:53] <yukichocomilk> PD still has that position 3 move equipped that she can't evne use LUL
[4:38:57] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Shady_Zaku I mean, it helps a lot with the fact that Death's Doors enemies survive the first hit of death, then will likely die on their turn from burn damage,
[4:38:57] <Brandon__Brando> I love when I get salt mail
[4:39:05] <Lefteron> I only get salty by rng systems or if the other player is brugind while using exploits.
[4:39:06] <%Th3SmartAlec> Orgy PogChamp
[4:39:28] <Lefteron> braging*
[4:39:36] <+machinetoys> kind lost
[4:39:37] <+Shady_Zaku> @Th3SmartAlec Doesn't one of the items increase burn chance he has?
[4:39:44] <dds333a> everyone takes aim
[4:39:45] <+Shady_Zaku> if so he ought to get that ooon
[4:40:01] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Shady_Zaku Yep, I think Woolie thinks it's Burn 'Resistance'
[4:40:07] <%brisk_dacat> That’s why I only play darts in p5
[4:40:57] <%Th3SmartAlec> Call attention on Leper to tank damage
[4:41:44] <Parapattern> It reminds them that they are not the protagonist
[4:41:46] <+Grayhammatter> uh... whoa
[4:41:56] <+Grayhammatter> that's looking pretty evil
[4:41:56] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:42:05] <%RealThiele> but instead they blamed the beasts
[4:42:12] <+Zyquux> this is too real
[4:42:17] <%KetsuoTaberu> that cultist looking kinda dried out
[4:42:41] <dds333a> @parapattern sure LUL

[4:43:32] <Afrosamasenpai> oh no this one has a limit
[4:43:47] <%Th3SmartAlec> there we go LUL
[4:43:51] <dds333a> here it is
[4:43:59] <pkoffing> has woolie taken the grillpill yet?
[4:44:01] <%RealThiele> the timed combats are so weird to me. i get they dont want people cheesing but its a poor way to accomplish what they want
[4:44:20] <%RealThiele> like in 5 rounds i guess the monsters get bored and wander off
[4:44:46] <grimeything> @RealThiele That can create a cheese of its own, can't it?
[4:44:49] <+wizard_of_diamonds> She "m'lady"'ed him LUL
[4:44:57] <whiteblacklight74> *tips fedora*
[4:45:00] <+Grayhammatter> oh no...

[4:45:40] <%townzzzzz> why be alive when you can die
[4:45:41] <+mechslayer71> one shotting puts of the final boss and shit
[4:45:46] <royb2> Stagecoach roadtrip (FINAL)
[4:46:04] <%Th3SmartAlec> @RealThiele The 5 rounds just suck. The only time you get to the end is when enemies are Death's Door over and over again
[4:46:24] <%Explodincatz> this stress mechanic seems random and uncontrollable
[4:46:24] <+Shady_Zaku> that's a good quirck HOW?!
[4:46:32] <%RealThiele> yea enemy death resist is insanely high
[4:46:37] <royb2> The round limit seems bleh and too tight
[4:46:38] <%Th3SmartAlec> Also, this is why DOT effects are good on enemies, it can kill the on Death's Door
[4:47:00] <+mechslayer71> I always DoT big guys with DBR just for that
[4:47:14] <%Th3SmartAlec> You got one round
[4:47:29] <dds333a> @explodincatz it can be mitigated and whatnot
[4:47:39] <%Th3SmartAlec> Oof
[4:47:55] <%Th3SmartAlec> That's actually bad, the token still stays
[4:47:58] <+Grayhammatter> oof
[4:48:01] <+mechslayer71> but now he still could dodge the big hit
[4:48:03] <%RealThiele> bypassing the token is worse imo he keeps it
[4:48:04] <+mechslayer71> he didnt tho
[4:48:10] <%Th3SmartAlec> Its over

[4:50:52] <CrowbarFacelift> jesus

[4:51:42] <CrowbarFacelift> that didn't a whole lot of room for learning wtf to do
[4:51:46] <inimata> shoulda backed up fukn immediately
[4:51:50] <CrowbarFacelift> didn't leave*
[4:51:56] <yukichocomilk> wait until you do the jester ones LUL
[4:51:56] <+eanscrale> Yeah no one likes remembering their ex
[4:52:08] <%Th3SmartAlec> @mechslayer71 That's the weird thing, I could have sworn I just poisoned his drink and that was it
[4:52:08] <dds333a> @yukichocomilk Kappa
[4:52:09] <velgaduere> turns out, it's really hard to deal with abusers
[4:52:10] <Arqartur0> wasn't this a Jet Set Radio stream? LUL
[4:52:21] <Arqartur0> not gonna complain, though
[4:52:23] <+mechslayer71> I mean. the cart was clearly guarded but he went for it anyway. that's why it went so bad so quick
[4:52:23] <+pectusumbra> there's a rhythm to it
[4:52:26] <dds333a> LUL LUL LUL
[4:52:27] <royb2> he goofs it and then plans to goof it even worse
[4:52:34] <inimata> That's the biggest and dumbest of goof plans
[4:52:34] <Hydrapissed> woolie failed the murder lol
[4:52:55] <+mechslayer71> @th3smartalec it might not have been guarded right away. it's not guaranteed first turn
[4:53:03] <+mechslayer71> at least I don't think so
[4:53:07] <+Shady_Zaku> @Estwilde Yeah lol pretty much having a laugh. I get the appeal but it would drive me nuuuts, I usually play to de-stress not have more. But its a sick game yeah
[4:53:27] <inimata> @mechslayer71 im pretty sure it is and you have to wait it out a lil more
[4:53:43] <+pectusumbra> it's only for plauge at this point if you use mag rain
[4:53:46] <%Th3SmartAlec> @mechslayer71 Then I got super lucky LUL
[4:53:54] <Estwilde> @Shady_Zaku yeah for sure. it's a totally different kind of fun :D
[4:54:05] <+mechslayer71> is it? either way trying to poison a guarded cart isn't a good move @inimata
[4:54:24] <inimata> @mechslayer71 yea goofs of the highest order only out here
[4:54:54] <Hydrapissed> OH BOI 2x goat 2x butchers
[4:55:02] <%Th3SmartAlec> Oof bad order
[4:55:10] <Saltmeisterr> whats the bonus of this match
[4:55:19] <Saltmeisterr> the enemy modifier i mean
[4:55:22] <NeroInfinite> stabby smashy time
[4:55:24] <Hydrapissed> inc invasive species crit
[4:55:28] <Impeachedpear3> 666 viewers
[4:55:31] <Saltmeisterr> on the top left
[4:56:12] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:56:12] <Impeachedpear3> top left right now means shuffle
[4:56:24] <+pectusumbra> I've never seen that move actually work, they always kick them off
[4:57:05] <+Grayhammatter> nice crit
[4:57:05] <inimata> huuuuuge
[4:57:12] <+Grayhammatter> we take those
[4:58:12] <inimata> man the Leper in DD2 is so much more reliable than in DD1
[4:58:24] <%Th3SmartAlec> all my homies hate Audrey
[4:58:54] <+Grayhammatter> frenzied enemies D:
[4:59:04] <yukichocomilk> or is it merely a trick of the light?
[4:59:13] <%Th3SmartAlec> this is comfortable at the moment
[4:59:14] <rkbinder> arrogance is a slow and insidious killer
[4:59:19] <NeroInfinite> yep
[4:59:24] <inimata> nah he had a debuff
[4:59:25] <+Shady_Zaku> To be fair, Audrey sucks and no one likes her this session lol
[4:59:28] <+pectusumbra> he had a damage down token
[4:59:33] <+Grayhammatter> must have had a debuff
[4:59:35] <+pectusumbra> you clicked the right thing, it canceled out
[4:59:36] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Overconfidence, a slow and insidious killer.
[4:59:40] <shinichizio> Dropped inputs are a swift and hilarious fiesta
[4:59:45] <Impeachedpear3> it cancelled out the damage debuff
[4:59:48] <+mechslayer71> the attack buff gets balanced out by a damage debuff
[4:59:50] <Estwilde> respectful nod
[5:00:34] <+Shady_Zaku> ripsky
[5:00:34] <%Th3SmartAlec> This exact situation is why Man At Arms is pretty good
[5:01:02] <+TopTieramisu> no anti-vaxxers in this squad
[5:01:05] <inimata> that damage holy shit
[5:01:31] <Estwilde> I'm guessing if they don't like each other then you'd have been struggling so much just to get this far that any one battle would prolly be the last
[5:01:34] <+Grayhammatter> slippery
[5:02:47] <+mechslayer71> as long as we don't get hit with that invasive species, we good
[5:03:13] <inimata> fuck reposte we don't give a fuck bout no reposte
[5:03:14] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1463039561215401988?t=hxoyuIobXdvYv38oBvV5_Q&s=19
[5:03:15] <+mechslayer71> @estwilde yeah all negatives is actually kinda unwinnabled
[5:03:15] <ElPlasa> Can't riposte if you dead
[5:03:16] <+Grayhammatter> sometimes come crimes
[5:03:20] <+Shady_Zaku> HEAL ya BOI
[5:03:39] <%Th3SmartAlec> time for healing
[5:03:47] <Estwilde> Paraselsus could really use a battle buddy right now
[5:04:07] <+Grayhammatter> damn
[5:04:13] <%Th3SmartAlec> Crit plague grenade it is
[5:04:14] <+Grayhammatter> round 5 too
[5:04:15] <inimata> Plague doctor heal really gets outpaced super fast it doesn't seem to really scale up that well
[5:04:21] <+pectusumbra> buff dismas and kill?
[5:04:22] <Estwilde> round 5
[5:04:29] <+Shady_Zaku> This maaaay have been a mistake to go in on the fight
[5:04:34] <Estwilde> oh
[5:04:36] <Estwilde> this isnt timed i think?
[5:04:49] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Estwilde only some rad battles are time
[5:04:55] <Estwilde> right right 👍
[5:04:56] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Estwilde road battles
[5:05:25] <+mechslayer71> random blockade battles on the road. anything on a node or an ambush isn't timed
[5:05:34] <inimata> bodied
[5:05:42] <inimata> Woolie
[5:05:42] <%Explodincatz> bale
[5:05:44] <+pectusumbra> what's that gold thing?

[5:05:59] <+Shady_Zaku> fukken BAIL
[5:05:59] <dan_g_v> be brave
[5:06:01] <Saltmeisterr> Bail it hard
[5:06:03] <WakeUpThrow> A little overconfidence never killed anyone, right?
[5:06:03] <Littlezilla> not worth imo
[5:06:05] <NeroInfinite> dodge this battle
[5:06:06] <+pectusumbra> eh, 2 is enough
[5:06:06] <+Grayhammatter> i'd bail, but i'm a coward
[5:06:06] <yukichocomilk> escape
[5:06:07] <inimata> bail immediately
[5:06:12] <BlackermanZX> not worth it
[5:06:15] <all4integrity> Bail
[5:06:19] <%Th3SmartAlec> You're not using the 12% crit, why the fuck would you use the Blight resistance LUL
[5:06:24] <dan_g_v> ypu can do it
[5:06:26] <olwe123> Bail

[5:06:59] <rReizs> EA bout to get reggie
[5:07:00] <HotSauceFiend> is content pushing a type of mind goblin?
[5:07:11] <%Th3SmartAlec> Time to dump that stale bread
[5:07:14] <+mechslayer71> the boss is in lairs, not this one
[5:07:16] <inimata> Can't you get new guys at the Inn?
[5:07:17] <Afrosamasenpai> FUCK THAT MEAT BABY
[5:07:20] <%Th3SmartAlec> No, that's the Lair
[5:07:21] <+mechslayer71> that's not this one woolie
[5:07:24] <Impeachedpear3> meat baby is only in the lair
[5:07:27] <Littlezilla> oh that's in lairs
[5:07:30] <Saltmeisterr> no it would have been a cultist fight woolie
[5:07:33] <Impeachedpear3> not the last fight of the area
[5:07:34] <+mechslayer71> the lair is a separate thing entirely
[5:07:40] <Littlezilla> this would have been rough still though
[5:07:43] <+eanscrale> This place is like a Vegan's worst nightmare
[5:08:01] <NeroInfinite> It's my worst night mare and I'm not evne vegan
[5:08:02] <Littlezilla> your loathing is low so the reward was still bad
[5:08:10] <Impeachedpear3> the fight still would've been cultists which suck to fight
[5:08:14] <%Th3SmartAlec> Move and Bleed can go
[5:08:43] <+mechslayer71> Reggie, tell woolie the truth of chat pleeesssssseeeeee or I'LL DIE Kappa
[5:08:46] <inimata> Welp nm
[5:09:08] <inimata> Hopeful is now fuked
[5:09:24] <dr_uppercut> baerROLL
[5:09:29] <CthuluIsSpy> Don't you still get a manor full of recruits?
[5:09:33] <%Th3SmartAlec> @mechslayer71 I wonder if Woolie has just always avoid the last 3 fights thinking it was the Lair
[5:09:47] <shinichizio> Is this inn called The Shambler's Altar? Excuse me?
[5:10:01] <+mechslayer71> @th3smartalec I was thinking that, I'm almost certain that's what it is
[5:10:04] <%Th3SmartAlec> Hard skinned, nicec
[5:10:29] <+mechslayer71> mistakes like that I a game he's supposedly played an ass load off can only be explained by that I think
[5:10:30] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts

[5:12:44] <MasterCosmic> Get back in that gane!
[5:12:47] <+ctdxii> Had this stream playing in the background and assumed it was one of the expansions
[5:12:53] <%Th3SmartAlec> EVASIVE YOOOOOOO
[5:13:00] <Estwilde> damn Bean and Dismas were best buds too
[5:13:04] <Estwilde> that changed quick huh
[5:13:51] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[5:14:13] <+Grayhammatter> yo, we at neutral
[5:15:01] <%Th3SmartAlec> One issue with the way this is laid out is that ideally you should pick the Route first so you can properly prioritize your buffs
[5:15:38] <+mechslayer71> you can tho, it's just not presented first
[5:15:39] <inimata> @Th3SmartAlec I mean you can look at the available routes before you pick one can you not?
[5:15:41] <%Th3SmartAlec> PIG PogChamp
[5:15:42] <Impeachedpear3> she's got full health
[5:15:42] <+Shady_Zaku> @Estwilde I know, its sad to see ho ridiculously fast things go to shit lol
[5:15:49] <+mechslayer71> @inimata you can
[5:16:05] <inimata> yeah I thought so
[5:16:22] <%Dakuu75> "your winter wheels" lol
[5:16:23] <Impeachedpear3> the pig roast is really good
[5:16:25] <%Th3SmartAlec> @inimata Yes, but the UI leads players to do it in a certain order
[5:17:07] <%Dakuu75> this narrator tingles my pingles
[5:17:18] <+Grayhammatter> wayne june doing a top-notch job as usual
[5:17:25] <Impeachedpear3> that roast pig tho
[5:17:30] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> ugh im so full, ive done nothing but sit and watch YT and Twitch for hours XD

[5:17:39] <%Th3SmartAlec> Bye Pig
[5:18:14] <inimata> its so weird you can only buff the skills once. I'm assuming you'd be able to do more when the rest of the games areas come out
[5:18:25] <+pectusumbra> yes that is correct. It used to be just free stress heal but was the best skill in the game

[5:18:54] <Afrosamasenpai> rip infinite use
[5:19:06] <yukichocomilk> she literally couldn't use incision in rank 4 LUL
[5:19:38] <Estwilde> 5 turns of bleed = cash in for immediate 5 turns of dmg right?
[5:19:40] <%Th3SmartAlec> ... Oh. I didn't realize it was future turns. Holy fuck.
[5:19:45] <+Grayhammatter> 75% of what you had
[5:19:54] <Estwilde> 75% of it yeah
[5:19:55] <%Th3SmartAlec> Man, would be great if the game clarified that.
[5:19:57] <+pectusumbra> 75% of your dots as damage up front
[5:19:59] <inimata> THats absurdly good
[5:20:09] <Estwilde> So doing it immediately sounds good
[5:20:18] <Estwilde> DoT up and then blow it up
[5:20:21] <Lefteron> Makes dot into burst
[5:20:22] <+pectusumbra> Oh if you're feeling dead I'll be your reanimator~
[5:20:34] <+Shady_Zaku> People REALLY seems to havve issues with the new UI, hopefully they adress that and make it easier to figure out all the icons and abilities etc
[5:21:19] <metabot64> any news about mobile ports?
[5:21:21] <Estwilde> That does seem like a cool team composition to build for
[5:21:48] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Shady_Zaku A simple bar of icons on the screen during Wagon driving would help a lot. You're forced to use keyboard shortcuts constantly, and some menus are unaccesibile for no reason sometimes.
[5:21:49] <$razielhex> By Sigmar!  Bless this ravaged body!
[5:21:52] <%bruuzer12> Jester is sick in this game. His shrine missions are really cool in concept

[5:33:04] <Estwilde> You need to get that humility early hopefully
[5:33:35] <Estwilde> Training in BJJ (any memes aside) can absolutely teach you that
[5:33:53] <+Shady_Zaku> Oh riiight, Reynauld is like the crusader knight guy! He was one of the iconic characters in DD1 imo, is he really not in this yet?
