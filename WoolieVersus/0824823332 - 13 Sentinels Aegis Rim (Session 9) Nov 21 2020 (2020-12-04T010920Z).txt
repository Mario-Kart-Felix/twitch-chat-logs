[0:11:27] <Mr_Strut> But otherwise
[0:11:51] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @mr_strut i read that as furries and got confused LUL
[0:12:09] <SpaceGuntank> man i could never get past that bloody palace stage with 3 of those fuckers, that shit was HARD

[0:15:23] <Mr_Strut> aww
[0:15:44] <%0rond> they showcase the styles so well, royal guard will walk slowly towards you while blocking everything, trickster is untouchable, swordmaster will use all those moves that are too hard to use for you while style switching, and gunslinger will just pepper you with everything at once
[0:15:50] <+skyheys> jumping
[0:16:09] <+CzarinaXANA> You can also clash with their attacks
[0:16:16] <%RyuuAoi> Basically Dark Souls

[3:31:33] <+skyheys> GAME IS AMAZING
[3:31:33] <%WritebroAlpha> Glad to see that Renya's route broke Woolie's fear of Miura, only for that fear to come back TWICE AS STRONG
[3:31:35] <%0rond> NOT EVEN 50% YET
[3:31:35] <+Sp3ctre48> This was a very funny session LUL
[3:31:37] <%arancet> i can only promise this never stops
[3:31:37] <+213372bu> Just wanted to say "Kamasutra of FUCK" is strong
[3:31:38] <%Razputin217> YOU ARE FREE NOW
[3:31:38] <%Irridium> THIS IS MY FUCKING GOTY NOT EVEN CLOSE
[3:31:41] <%ChoculaUltra> just when you think you know, you fuckin' don't : the game
[3:31:41] <tattleworm> CEO of FUCK.
[3:31:41] <+Ryaotz> lovin it
[3:31:42] <irfan_> https://clips.twitch.tv/ExpensiveConfidentFungusMVGame
[3:31:43] <+MetroidPrimeRib> unbelievable I'm acting like an amateur
[3:31:46] <+Amaideus> The spoilercast for this game is going to be INCREDIBLE, so many bombs being dropped and we're not even halfway through yet. Following along has been amazing.
[3:31:47] <%coolthulhuu> no spoilers but it really nails the ending imo
[3:31:48] <%cobalt_phoenix_> FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
[3:31:49] <%TubeMan642> wtf man
[3:31:50] <%Livelinne> FREEEEEEDOM
[3:31:59] <%gatorafan> BITCH YOU THOUGHT: The Game
[3:32:00] <Takfloyd> I'd say going heavy on Miura's route is by far the most batshit way to play the game, possibly should have been gated a bit more IMO
[3:32:00] <%cobalt_phoenix_> also I LOVE THIS GAME IT FUCKS ME SO GOOD
[3:32:04] <alrobot2014> it feels like somebody lit some gasoline in my mind palace
[3:32:11] <%ChoculaUltra> the ending still makes my heart feel things when I think about it
[3:32:12] <+skyheys> THE WHITEBOARD IS LITERALLY A CUBE, THERES PICTURES
[3:32:14] <+Amaideus> By the way, I CAlLED THE CEO BEING RENYA
[3:32:17] <quietshun> Pat needs to keep playing the gane for a spoilercast to happen
[3:32:20] <Kenyuki4> Freedom!!!
[3:32:20] <+Amaideus> I called instantly
[3:32:22] <%Livelinne> Mind well blown. Again.
[3:32:23] <%DojoDGZ> YAY i can talk now
[3:32:25] <%Razputin217> If this game doesn’t win Best Narrative at the VGA’s I’m gonna shit
[3:32:32] <%ChoculaUltra> ah, totally thought Pat beat it off-stream or something by now
[3:32:34] <reonome> vote for 13 sentinels you fucks
[3:32:39] <T_Sasquatch> Post in chaaaattt
[3:32:39] <+cvp5127> @Razputin217 im just glad it got nominated
[3:32:40] <+213372bu> My gameplay was TOTALLY different from your route, my brain is breaking try even to rationalize how you're going through this... and I beat the game LUL
[3:32:41] <+Sp3ctre48> I do agree actually, the game should probably have been even more aggressive about locking you out of routes
[3:32:41] <%0rond> so you're morimura, and you're morimura, and YOU'RE MURIMURA, are there any other morimuras I should know about? AM I MORIMURA?!
[3:32:43] <%IzazaOzihaha> I busted out laughing at Renya Beardo reveal react
[3:32:46] <%TitaniumDragoonNeo> @Razputin217 Prep your bunghole then.
[3:32:50] <alrobot2014> @Razputin217 but tthat would require the critics to have played it and survived
[3:32:53] <reonome> OOPS ALL MORIMURAS
[3:32:54] <KngMatthias> Love this.
[3:32:56] <%Irridium> why the fuck is this game not in the "games with impact" category
[3:32:56] <chaos2frozen> I voted for 13 Sentinels for best Narrative
[3:32:57] <T_Sasquatch> Post link in chaaaattt
[3:32:59] <+ShoggothHat> @razputin217 I hope it does, but it's too niche for it I think.
[3:33:00] <quietshun> @choculaultra Bope, he still hasn't beaten it yet unfortunately
[3:33:04] <cerazor01> I like how at this point the Mecha are literally JUST a side distraction.
[3:33:07] <%ChoculaUltra> dammit Pat
[3:33:08] <+Amaideus> "WE'RE ALL BIG TITTY WAIFUS"!
[3:33:09] <quietshun> *nope lol
[3:33:12] <jorniev> non stop infinite morimura
[3:33:13] <chaos2frozen> Games for Impact is for indies isn't it
[3:33:17] <+BigCoffee> @chaos2frozen watch TLOU2 win anyway :(
[3:33:20] <%gatorafan> Sora has a bit of Morimura inside of him
[3:33:27] <jorniev> unlimited morimura works
[3:33:31] <reonome> Morixmura
[3:33:37] <chaos2frozen> @BigCoffee that's fine, it is a longshot
[3:33:40] <+skyheys> @chaos2frozen Theres a fucking Microsoft game in that category dude
[3:33:41] <Arweynn> is it just going to be all morimura's in terminator bodies?
[3:33:41] <+ShoggothHat> I was disappointed it wasn't even nominated for art direction for the vgas as well though
[3:33:47] <+Sp3ctre48> Sora is only half Morimura
[3:33:54] <+cvp5127> LUL
[3:34:00] <+skyheys> @sp3ctre48 that's nuts
[3:34:03] <%0rond> you're too late juro... i'm already a morimura
[3:34:05] <%WritebroAlpha> https://clips.twitch.tv/CredulousPrettyMoonPermaSmug
[3:34:09] <%AlphaTauri> AlphaTauri subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! finally popped this baby out
[3:34:15] <Takfloyd> if you start fuyusaka or juro's routes first, you'll know iori=morimura from the first hour... these guys went like 20 hours before realizing it
[3:34:15] <+Amaideus> "Juro, you fool. You're a morimura too!"
[3:34:17] <%gatorafan> Granadina DrinkPurple DxCat
[3:34:37] <+Amaideus> They literally skipped the first 2 protags to show up
[3:34:45] <+Amaideus> And went to whoever looked interesting
[3:34:50] <+Amaideus> I have no problem with this
[3:35:04] <rosemon5001> BIG duDudu BIG duDudu BIG duDudu
[3:35:11] <+skyheys> NotLikeThis
[3:35:20] <+Amaideus> I'm gonna corkboard the shit out of this this week
[3:35:24] <+Sp3ctre48> I tried to keep everyone's percentages around the same level for my playthrough
[3:35:25] <%cobalt_phoenix_> I stand by saying that there is no wrong way to play this, every experience will be unique
[3:35:31] <+skyheys> Overriding clone babies is dark dude
[3:35:32] <%Irridium> oh I binged this shit hard
[3:35:34] <+cvp5127> I binged it
[3:35:36] <%WritebroAlpha> I binged this game in like 3 days
[3:35:37] <+Amaideus> Is it?
[3:35:40] <%arancet> every chapter i had to take a break to process
[3:35:42] <+Amaideus> They wouldn't have memories baseline
[3:35:43] <+cvp5127> i chugged it
[3:35:47] <%WritebroAlpha> Unputdownable
[3:35:47] <+Amaideus> Those get injected later
[3:35:52] <alrobot2014> i wouldn't be able to keep myself away from the info
[3:35:55] <%cobalt_phoenix_> I finished between your first and second sessions LUL
[3:35:58] <+skyheys> I could only do 5 hours a day. took me a week.
[3:35:59] <T_Sasquatch> Link the mesoamerican Netflix thing please
[3:35:59] <chaos2frozen> @WoolieVersus I tried both method, I retained information better in short sessions
[3:36:00] <+Amaideus> It'd be like growing a body and leaving it a vegitible
[3:36:04] <+Sp3ctre48> I had to take a bunch of breaks so I could yell theories to myself
[3:36:05] <%TheLemuroid> I was screaming
[3:36:12] <+cvp5127> im still digesting tho
[3:36:16] <%WritebroAlpha> I literally watched Pat do Juro's prologue and then turned off his stream and bought the game
[3:36:21] <%WritebroAlpha> Finished it 3 days later
[3:36:25] <RetroCop87> I hit the game entirely in 3-4 hour chunks, and t was fine
[3:36:26] <+213372bu> 213372bu subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 4 month streak! My gameplay was TOTALLY different from your route, my brain is breaking try even to rationalize how you're going through this... and I beat the game LUL.... RE: binging it works really well when I rotated one ending per character
[3:36:39] <%Livelinne> took me a day to get through the trial version woolieDATTEBAYO
[3:36:39] <chaos2frozen> but only 2 sessions a week is tough man lol, you'll forget information
[3:36:40] <+MetroidPrimeRib> I played it in jp and am watching this to recontextualize and to hear dub
[3:36:42] <%TitaniumDragoonNeo> @chaos2frozen I regret binging the whole game over 4 days. But what a fucking 4 days it was.
[3:36:50] <%ChoculaUltra> this game would've been crazy on the vita had it come out during that era
[3:36:50] <+Amaideus> Only reason I haven't bought it is that it's stuck on Ps4 and I can't set mine up because reasons
[3:36:54] <+skyheys> @chaos2frozen This
[3:37:19] <+Amaideus> So I'm stuck with this playthrough unless I go watch someone else's, and they'd take it in a completely different direction
[3:37:20] <chaos2frozen> @chaos2frozen yup, I binge the second half of the game during my leave period and I slightly regreted it
[3:37:21] <%Irridium> main reason I binged it was to avoid spoilers
[3:37:21] <Mr_Strut> I was gonna say you wouldn't binge watch eva, but some probably do
[3:37:31] <%Livelinne> is it true that now it's on sale?
[3:37:35] <Takfloyd> I recommend watching other playthroughs to see how different they are
[3:37:37] <%RyuuAoi> This that Persona type shit!
[3:37:43] <Takfloyd> nicoB has a good one on youtube
[3:37:45] <+skyheys> @amaideus Its on PS5 Kappa
[3:37:46] <dundunsun> Did they finish the game?
[3:37:47] <+BigCoffee> Hey guys, I was wondering if I could give a non spoiler input for combat. The skills that are say Error are simply passives, there have no animation and that's why it says error.
[3:37:50] <+Amaideus> Yeah but that's an "after i've finished" thing
[3:37:50] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:37:50] <chaos2frozen> @Livelinne yes, 30% if I didn't remember wrongly
[3:38:00] <+Amaideus> Trust me, I'm gonna watch other LPs once this is done
[3:38:09] <+Sp3ctre48> Play it the best way for you
[3:38:09] <Kghaleon> This LP made me buy the game. Already beat it.
[3:38:14] <rosemon5001> we need to see what punished woolie would say about this eye patch and all PowerUpL LUL
[3:38:19] <+213372bu> Oh no totally it's different for everyone and what makes this game GOAT material imo
[3:38:22] <%Livelinne> @chaos2frozen wow, thanks! I'm gonna get it woolieYE
[3:38:26] <%ChoculaUltra> I legit cannot wait for the next Vanillaware game
[3:38:30] <%ChoculaUltra> I'm foaming at the mouth.
[3:38:32] <%RyuuAoi> Do OG Persona on the PSP next! Woolie WILL get bad end and have to play again! NotATK
[3:38:33] <%cobalt_phoenix_> I have no self control FeelsBadMan
[3:38:41] <Kenyuki4> Took a week and a half. Boy you got to wait a second to think sometime
[3:38:53] <+skyheys> Tell the children the game's on sale, @woolieversus
[3:39:04] <%WritebroAlpha> I prefer not to binge, but when something like this catches my eye it's impossible to walk away
[3:39:06] <%WritebroAlpha> Holy shit
[3:39:13] <%ChoculaUltra> bro I'm about to make a new psn account just to buy it again to show support LUL
[3:39:15] <spinbel> Binge it though
[3:39:24] <+skyheys> Me. Kappa
[3:39:26] <T_Sasquatch> I do
[3:39:27] <+Amaideus> If I could buy this game
[3:39:27] <Mr_Strut> Binge One Piece
[3:39:28] <+Sp3ctre48> Kamitani said they'll probably never make anything like 13 Sentinels again unfortunately
[3:39:32] <alrobot2014> some of us don't have people to talk to
[3:39:37] <+Amaideus> Literally all my time not working would be spent blasting through this
[3:39:37] <spinbel> You're assuming I have friends, Woolie
[3:39:38] <%RyuuAoi> Don't kill yourself over it. Do it on your time. We are here for you all the way, Woolie!
[3:39:39] <T_Sasquatch> Obviously i take a break
[3:39:42] <Takfloyd> I binged it, but with frequent walks outside to heavily think it over... figured out every plot twist in advance that way though
[3:39:47] <+213372bu> LUL
[3:39:48] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Sp3ctre48 I mean how could you
[3:39:49] <%Irridium> Yeah Kamitani said this was the hardest thing he's ever done and is not eager to do it again
[3:39:49] <+cvp5127> lol friends
[3:39:51] <%ChoculaUltra> FeelsBadMan
[3:40:00] <quietshun> Yeah this game is a once in a lifetime thing, it ain't ginna be replicated
[3:40:02] <+Amaideus> Yeah, I bet Kamitani won't
[3:40:07] <T_Sasquatch> You can't just click play on the next one LUL
[3:40:08] <reonome> friend...?
[3:40:10] <%RyuuAoi> BINGE BIBLE BLACK
[3:40:11] <+skyheys> Why cant I talk to people and digest later
[3:40:17] <%WritebroAlpha> I'm enjoying Woolie's pace, tbh. I'm here for his and Reggie's amazing reactions.
[3:40:18] <+Amaideus> I tried to do something like this and ran into too much shit I just couldn't make work alongside each other and gave up
[3:40:21] <jorniev> DONT BINGE DEVILMNA
[3:40:28] <%ChoculaUltra> ngl, the only other game that does time travel that I dig as much as 13 Sentinels is probably Chrono Trigger. It's up there for me.
[3:40:29] <prime_name> Oh boy, can't wait to go and visit my friends to talk about recent media.
[3:40:36] <chaos2frozen> @Irridium yeah I can imagine, it would be awhile before we see anyone attempt a story like this ever again
[3:40:42] <%cobalt_phoenix_> binge one piece Kappa
[3:40:46] <+skyheys> @prime_name Make sure to spread the covid
[3:40:56] <mortificent> Binging Black Mirror is like binging depression
[3:41:00] <T_Sasquatch> The relationship one with literally blocking people and recording memories still gets to me
[3:41:01] <%Irridium> also hard to talk about this game with others if you all go through different paths. hard to talk that way without spoiling various character paths
[3:41:01] <%WritebroAlpha> lel, I binged Chainsaw Man the other week. Went from 0 to caught up in 2 days
[3:41:10] <jorniev> DO NOT BINGE oyasumin pun pun DONT
[3:41:21] <T_Sasquatch> Honestly Pop team epic is barely funny
[3:41:25] <%Livelinne> Pop team epic is a good yuri shiaVibin
[3:41:26] <+skyheys> @jorniev big depression
[3:41:27] <%TheLemuroid> Where's the 2nd half tho
[3:41:31] <rosemon5001> brain fired mayhaps? @WoolieVersus
[3:41:32] <+Amaideus> No Bloodrayne in the clip though
[3:41:34] <+Amaideus> Not even a mention
[3:41:36] <%WritebroAlpha> Pop Team Epic is hilarious
[3:41:43] <Arweynn> before you go, what caused the unmentioned 6 hour delay? if you're free to talk about it
[3:41:43] <%RyuuAoi> Binge GUNDAM W
[3:41:45] <%cobalt_phoenix_> woolieSPICE woolieVS woolieONEGUY ?
[3:41:51] <T_Sasquatch> psaBig psaWrong
[3:41:52] <%aiwass8> I predicted 80-90% of twists before the reveal because apparently George and I think alike. So I didn't have much trouble binging.
[3:41:55] <jorniev> the wrongest minh HAS EVER BEEN
[3:42:07] <%ChoculaUltra> Binge G Gundam legit won't be disappointed.
[3:42:08] <T_Sasquatch> psaBig psaHoldon
