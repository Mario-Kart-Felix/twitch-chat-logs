[0:13:17] <arurorablade> blue 2017 is super good
[0:13:17] <Who_lio42> its movie blue but NOT billy from that movie
[0:13:22] <+BestTeaMaker> kat used to be so busted
[0:13:24] <+McSoliace> woolie picked the hardest characters in the game
[0:13:25] <+babinokid87> Doggie is from spd
[0:13:26] <+BestTeaMaker> she had meterless infinites
[0:13:27] <Mordexai0> @wolfofsound Disney Owns Him
[0:13:27] <%ggbhtg> Da Shi is the Jungle Fury / Gekiranger villain
[0:13:31] <Jeemukun> need some alien rangers up in this
[0:13:31] <%emeraldskrull> woolieTRASH woolieTRASH

[0:13:39] <@Solidus_113> woolieGASM
[0:13:45] <arurorablade> we dont talk about alien ranger
[0:13:49] <jemeralddragoon> That movie sucked
[0:13:49] <%dinnydanny777> The recent movie or the 90s movie?
[0:13:52] <%kyh9> she literally appears in one episode
[0:13:55] <%ggbhtg> We don't?
[0:13:55] <Mordexai0> @wolfofsound LOL Fox owned him but Disney now owns fox so.. lol
[0:13:56] <%kyh9> But they know what the fans want
[0:13:56] <+mariomarc> IT'S SMASH INPUTS WOOLIE
[0:13:58] <rad_dude123465> I love how flamboyant kat’s posing is
[0:13:59] <arurorablade> the 2017 is just.. ok
[0:14:01] <%kyh9> GIVE US RED TURBO TJ
[0:14:03] <Mordexai0> @dinnydanny777 Recent movie
[0:14:03] <Toaster_Noodle> No motions woolz
[0:14:21] <%wolfofsound> @Mordexai0 oh that's right he was just a movie villain and wasn't ever in the show huh? what a world
[0:14:23] <+l3sovikk> IS THAT DAN?
[0:14:23] <%dinnydanny777> Oh I've only seen the older one when I was young
[0:14:24] <+agumon9000> @WoolieVersus There are no motions in this game, its just Smash inputs
[0:14:26] <%kyh9> I actually really like this approach
[0:14:27] <Who_lio42> Kats outfit is funnier when you know its supposed to be a Swan like in the sentai ver
[0:14:31] <+McSoliace> hold special woolie
[0:14:32] <joylent_blue> l3sovikk yeah baby
[0:14:34] <Gutsandlove> the new one was ok, could have been better
[0:14:37] <SjoeB89> Woolie you have to learn to use his sword!!!
[0:14:37] <arurorablade> yes thats dan southworth
[0:14:40] <%ggbhtg> @l3sovikk a 1000 times yes
[0:14:43] <rad_dude123465> They weirdest part about the Cenozoic blue ranger is that in the 2017 he died off screen dude was hardly even a character
[0:14:47] <@Solidus_113> From what I've seen Leap is a good extender
[0:14:53] <SjoeB89> Virgil
[0:14:53] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:15:01] <Japanfreak2595> But Carter Grayson tho
[0:15:04] <arurorablade> hes also autistic
[0:15:13] <jemeralddragoon> Woolie just look at the damn move list
[0:15:18] <%ggbhtg> @rad_dude123465 you mean in the flashback intro? the fuk?
[0:15:20] <Mordexai0> @japanfreak2595 CARTER GRAYSON IS LITERALLY THE GOAT RED
[0:15:20] <%infinite_rotation> He’s on the spectrum
[0:15:23] <Who_lio42> billy was, Cenozoic was just a dude
[0:15:23] <+OkNow_64> Shadow rangers double super combo is so much fun to do
[0:15:26] <Bloogoose> There is no movelist, it's smash inputs
[0:15:28] <%infinite_rotation> As the movie likes to point out
[0:15:39] <%ggbhtg> Billy in the newer movie was the best character
[0:15:41] <SirDogBear> carter grayson would be the zoner that for some reason is meant to be played as a rush down character
[0:15:43] <+SvenHolgersson> Please tell me Woolie is maining Trini
[0:15:46] <arurorablade> they should put wild force red in with a katana
[0:15:48] <ZeeJiggle> Yeyeye
[0:15:48] <+SvenHolgersson> Also hi
[0:15:49] <Bloogoose> Here's actual Vergil
[0:15:54] <Who_lio42> Autism was a superpower lol
[0:15:58] <@Solidus_113> real vergil moveset
[0:16:00] <arurorablade> his hyper is he stabs his roomate
[0:16:15] <BalloniWright> oh so Cenozoic Blue is one of the ones who die in the very begining of the movie
[0:16:21] <%ggbhtg> Vergil is in the game in mind, but this is Vergil in body
[0:16:23] <arurorablade> no??
[0:16:23] <%infinite_rotation> Its virgils fursona
[0:16:26] <whimsicallifestyle> doggie kruger getting yiffed
[0:16:35] <masterfire23> does doggy kruger still have his TOD
[0:16:38] <Bloogoose> God Dai Shi's design is fucking radical
[0:16:46] <Mordexai0> @arurorablade LOL you talking about the Wild Force Red Ranger?
[0:16:48] <Who_lio42> yeah a lot like MvcI panther
[0:16:50] <arurorablade> yes
[0:16:53] <Toaster_Noodle> Dai Shi is amazing, I love him
[0:17:11] <+the22cstomp> fun fact dai shi is voiced by the ost composer in this game
[0:17:15] <fuzack> OBAMA!
[0:17:17] <Who_lio42> Dai shi has akuma normals
[0:17:17] <arurorablade> good

[0:17:49] <+SvenHolgersson> Akuma wishes he was as cool as Dai Shi
[0:17:53] <%ggbhtg> I guess we talking about how the 2017 movie started with a flashback of Zordon as a ranger, who Rita betrayed
[0:17:56] <+OkNow_64> I would kill to get the lunar wolf ranger or zen aku in this game
[0:17:56] <%infinite_rotation> I was gonna say doesnt she have a cat face like dogmin
[0:17:58] <arurorablade> i want that fight now
[0:17:58] <+mariomarc> Please check the movelists, some characters like Quatum are complicated
[0:18:01] <%ggbhtg> and killed his team
[0:18:04] <+the22cstomp> @rad_dude123465 in normal games, people die really quick, timer never runs out

[0:18:49] <+ZoltanBMagnus> Love the Dai Shi play. Kylo Ren as a power ranger was a cool character
[0:18:55] <%ggbhtg> Kat is a catgirl alien (no tail tho), Kruger is full doggo alien
[0:19:08] <arurorablade> as she should be
[0:19:11] <stormhawk9891> These are some the slowest matches I've ever seen in this game
[0:19:11] <Tacobellx21> Thanks for the PrideLaugh @psydaku

[0:22:12] <+vwvwvwvwvvvw> how do the zords work?
[0:22:18] <arurorablade> isnt it similar to the green
[0:22:19] <@Solidus_113> you have to unlock the alt though
[0:22:22] <arurorablade> just with the tiger
[0:22:23] <fuzack> GOLDAR!
[0:22:24] <%ggbhtg> Fuck man, Undonna is RIP, and so is Zedd
[0:22:38] <huskarl_zap> woah this stage is shit
[0:22:39] <+cvp5127> like a jap show LUL
[0:22:40] <Mordexai0> @solidus_113 It was a pee order thing
[0:22:43] <Who_lio42> oh i never knew about udonna. thats sad
[0:22:45] <Jeemukun> I mean, that was the Zyuranger design
[0:22:46] <%ggbhtg> Maaaan, Amy Jo is still bae, to this day
[0:22:46] <arurorablade> did anyone else see the mega force legendary battle fan edit
[0:22:47] <artificiallynatural> they're thee x-factor of the game. Once a character goes down, you can activate it to add megazord attacks to your normals
[0:22:49] <Mordexai0> pre*
[0:22:51] <Bloogoose> Yeah the rest of the stages look fine, but this one looks like ass
[0:22:56] <Bloogoose> It's kinda weird
[0:23:04] <kei_ar_> thats redfield to you
[0:23:07] <+Afterman_> this guy is comic only
[0:23:07] <joylent_blue> GUN ranger
[0:23:12] <%kyh9> This guy is actually from the comic
[0:23:13] <+Afterman_> hes from an alt world where drakkon took over
[0:23:15] <%FuqBoiSlim> He looks like hes from an edgier tokusatsu
[0:23:18] <Japanfreak2595> GUNSLINGER
[0:23:19] <Mordexai0> @afterman_ So is Drakkon
[0:23:21] <+Afterman_> yes
[0:23:22] <%kyh9> They basically mass-produce ranger powers for the empire
[0:23:22] <Drunkengen> GUN
[0:23:24] <+Afterman_> correct
[0:23:26] <%ggbhtg> PREPARE THE PLANET FOR MY RETURN
[0:23:26] <popcultureaficionado> Goldar is here mofo
[0:23:31] <+Afterman_> i have read all of the comics lol
[0:23:43] <+Afterman_> waiting for new issue of mmpr on the 24th
[0:23:45] <+agumon9000> Dragon Armor Trini, Ranger Slayer, Drakkon, and Mastadon Sentry are all the comic only rangers
[0:23:45] <SheefEatsBeef> shady;s back?
[0:23:53] <arurorablade> goldar gets an ep in beast morphers
[0:23:59] <BreakersAweigh> maaaaan the OG green ranger was so rad
[0:24:01] <%ggbhtg> This is Goldar's OB voice, right?
[0:24:06] <Solidnick18> Yeeeeeeee
[0:24:08] <joylent_blue> LUL
[0:24:08] <arurorablade> yes
[0:24:11] <%wolfofsound> that's always been the sickets
[0:24:16] <%wolfofsound> sickest*
[0:24:19] <midsneak1> Man the hit sound effects are little lackluster tbh
[0:24:20] <crimsonsaens> Green Ranger's overhead kick is nasty
[0:24:29] <Bloogoose> Look at Gordeau
[0:24:29] <KidKaiser23> @afterman_ How did you feel about the Beyond The Grid stuff? I thought it was serviceable but could’ve been stronger
[0:24:36] <Who_lio42> Gordeau baybee
[0:24:37] <%ggbhtg> @arurorablade Did that episode air outside the US? SPOILERS??
[0:24:49] <huskarl_zap> No Pirate domina? unsubscribed
[0:24:51] <arurorablade> idk but i can i drop the yt link
[0:24:53] <SjoeB89> Megas unlocked reggie
[0:25:01] <Amardeux> don't forget to call in your Zords
[0:25:07] <arurorablade> CALL THE ZORD
[0:25:09] <+agumon9000> The new Beast Morphers stuff is not released in the US yer
[0:25:12] <BalloniWright> woolie playing injustice with black ranger LUL
[0:25:23] <%ggbhtg> @arurorablade Im not talking about the Sentai movie, I know about that
[0:25:25] <stormhawk9891> @Amardeux Guess what tutorial they skipped
[0:25:26] <+Afterman_> @KidKaiser23 you mean that little mini arc with the solar ranger? I wish it lasted longer, it seemed so fuckinng cool
[0:25:30] <morningmoondude> goldar just needs to kill the red, green and black rangers by himself, he can do it
[0:25:33] <morningmoondude> oh no
[0:25:33] <fuzack> Call the zords
[0:25:34] <arurorablade> im talking about rangers
[0:25:36] <+Afterman_> i think they mmight actually tie some solar ranger shit into the new stuff
[0:25:49] <crimsonsaens> Goldar is a gorilla
[0:26:05] <Leafboi125> They aren't usign the megas :(
[0:26:08] <Amardeux> bless they remembered about the zords
[0:26:12] <arurorablade> bandra/rita's theme is wwonder land ish
[0:26:17] <KidKaiser23> @afterman_ You think? I’m hoping we get more Omega Ranger stuff
[0:26:20] <%ggbhtg> SUMMON ZA ZORDS
[0:26:29] <%ggbhtg> Do the FATAL BRO
[0:26:40] <BlackD0G57> this game is pretty fun
[0:26:40] <+Afterman_> @KidKaiser23 well ranger slayer is showing back up and I think she remembers everything that is going on. PLUS the return of a certain somebody soon..
[0:26:40] <KidKaiser23> If you liked the Solar Ranger stuff in the comics, you’d probably like the Super Sentai series of Kyuranger
[0:26:43] <arurorablade> babo is a vampire monkey
[0:26:53] <BreakersAweigh> Z
[0:27:01] <whimsicallifestyle> kyurangers is good kidkaiser
[0:27:05] <+agumon9000> The three new rangers are going to be Lauren Shiba, RJ, and Scorpina
[0:27:08] <+Afterman_> but yes the omega rangers are GODLY
[0:27:24] <KidKaiser23> The colors of the Solar Rangers are almost dead alike, and the story is about dismantling an intergalactic empire that has oppressed the universe
[0:27:24] <%dinnydanny777> He just has a gun
[0:27:34] <BlackD0G57> take out the gunman
[0:27:35] <+Afterman_> all you nerds need to go read the power ranger comics. they are the best power rangers has EVER been
[0:27:36] <KidKaiser23> Think of it like Power Ranger + Voltron on Netflix
[0:27:37] <%ggbhtg> They corrected the mistake with Hekyll not being a ranger in Dino Charge, via the comics.....but damn it
[0:27:40] <arurorablade> will scorpina and goldar have an interaction like 18 and krillin
[0:27:49] <KidKaiser23> @whimsicallifestyle You got taste!
[0:27:51] <arurorablade> they were married after all
[0:28:20] <%ggbhtg> @arurorablade you're mixing your sentai with your PR
[0:28:32] <+Afterman_> ye jpn goldar/scorpina were married
[0:28:32] <KidKaiser23> @ggbhtg Yeah fr, they did amazing job wit Hekyll imho
[0:28:39] <+Afterman_> though in the comics they DID go on a date to a fair
[0:28:41] <whimsicallifestyle> @KidKaiser23 thank you! and fuck the guys who say lucky is annoying!
[0:28:47] <%ggbhtg> PR is not a dub yo LUL
[0:28:56] <Amardeux> dont forget about snap backs to finish ofrf their characters
[0:29:01] <arurorablade> ye
[0:29:01] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:29:04] <Amardeux> i think thats why matches are taking so long
[0:29:15] <+Afterman_> rip time out
[0:29:17] <arurorablade> but yeah goldar is back for an ep and his voice sucks :(
[0:29:25] <SjoeB89> Those fucking putty voices are so creepy when zed calls them.
[0:29:34] <KidKaiser23> @whimsicallifestyle I think people are too spoiled after Captain Marvelous from Gokaiger. Not every red ranger needs to be a hardass, Kamen Rider Fandom kinda had this issue after Decade
[0:29:38] <+mariomarc> It's on inputs
[0:29:42] <Mordexai0> you call it
[0:29:46] <arurorablade> do you think lord zedd uses putties for like dumb stuff.
[0:29:47] <artificiallynatural> the megazord attacks are attached to the normals
[0:29:47] <SheefEatsBeef> timer scam
[0:29:52] <arurorablade> like bringing him a beer
[0:30:19] <+Voidwyvern> Light medium or heavy makes zord do an attack
[0:30:33] <arurorablade> spds zoed is fucking great
[0:30:42] <+Voidwyvern> I love the life steal
[0:30:43] <arurorablade> it heals you or hurts your opponent
[0:30:47] <+roseshrimp> kiramager's red is GREAT
[0:30:51] <+roseshrimp> if you dont like him you're a coward
[0:30:55] <%Pookiedaexzile> Furry cat ranger from SPD
[0:31:00] <+UberWolfman> How many virgils have we seen chat?
[0:31:00] <Leafboi125> Reality Stone!
[0:31:04] <whimsicallifestyle> @KidKaiser23 totally agree, just let the people in the kids show have fun
[0:31:07] <huskarl_zap> When is white lord drakkon?
[0:31:11] <%ggbhtg> @woolieversus from the comics
[0:31:16] <%theman515> I still can't believe this is a real game. I thought it was a mobile chinese rip off game for the longest time
[0:31:19] <artificiallynatural> alt colors aren't very distinct either so I always mix them up during mirror matches
[0:31:21] <+BestTeaMaker> @WoolieVersus they recently announced the next 3 dlc characters - RJ James (Wolf Ranger), Lauren Shiba (Samurai Ranger Fire) and Scorpina (Goldar's honey)
[0:31:24] <+LeaIsChill> GOHAN???
[0:31:32] <%joeobo2> mystic force was the rap
[0:31:32] <BalloniWright> pirate ranger looks cool SeemsGood
[0:31:33] <%dinnydanny777> IRIS
[0:31:39] <artificiallynatural> yeah she's baddass
[0:31:44] <%Jetzord> Oh no, Woolie found Trini
[0:31:45] <whimsicallifestyle> @roseshrimp yes!!! juuru is a good boy
[0:31:47] <fuzack> she is fun to use
[0:31:48] <+ZoltanBMagnus> Mystic force and operation overdrive had rap openings
[0:31:49] <KidKaiser23> Mystic Force opening was a Rap from the pits of Hell
[0:31:49] <Who_lio42> BIG GIRL BIG BOOTS
[0:31:51] <%ggbhtg> Kyle Hebert voices someone here
[0:31:51] <arurorablade> to bad saban fucked us on gokaiger
[0:31:54] <+UberWolfman> Potemkin Nose dive Pogchamp
[0:31:54] <+roseshrimp> juuru IS best boy
[0:31:56] <+mr_miyagichu> Trini has the best assist in the game she fits well on a team
[0:32:00] <crimsonsaens> She's broken with Goldar summon
[0:32:01] <+BestTeaMaker> trini is nuts
[0:32:08] <arurorablade> trini is sentinel on crack
[0:32:12] <+mr_miyagichu> 5bb is a launch with trini
[0:32:19] <artificiallynatural> got them reppukens
[0:32:28] <%ggbhtg> What was the Dragon Armor lore?
[0:32:36] <+agumon9000> Comic stuff
[0:32:36] <+ZoltanBMagnus> Yellow Megaforce ranger is so annoying in Legacy Wars
[0:32:39] <arurorablade> its from the story
[0:32:52] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Magna Defender giving me big Zero vibes
[0:32:56] <+Afterman_> im sad that go go just ended :(
[0:33:07] <KidKaiser23> I would love to see the Villain (I forget his name) from Dino Thunder in this game, have him function like Wesker too
[0:33:17] <+agumon9000> Sad they'll never see the Triforya Loops
[0:33:17] <arurorablade> YOURE RIGHT
[0:33:26] <Who_lio42> the trini beam OTGs
[0:33:27] <%ggbhtg> yes yes, but what was the LORE on the Dragon Armor?
[0:33:36] <crimsonsaens> Trini is one of the best anchors because she has one of the best assists and combos with Goldar
[0:33:37] <arurorablade> trini made it to fight
[0:33:41] <+badjab326> This game is free on Stadia
[0:33:45] <+mr_miyagichu> tagging off of trini's rushing specials (the grab and dive) is powerful to
[0:33:46] <technicallyfootsies> The Dragon armour is an evil alt timeline Dragonzord
[0:34:05] <+Afterman_> @ggbhtg drakkon remotely controlled the black dragon (the armor) to fight the rangers to test them. They beat the dragon and took the armor. Trini later used it in the war vs drakkon when ALL remaining living rangers showed up
[0:34:06] <technicallyfootsies> Was an enemy in the comics, Trini cannibalised it to use as armour
[0:34:07] <Mordexai0> @ggbhtg It's a corrupted Dragonzord that is emptied out for Trini to use
[0:34:19] <%The_Timo> Someone actually made it to animate her corpse
[0:34:36] <%The_Timo> I don't like my joke anymore
[0:34:36] <%ggbhtg> muchos garcias woolieLORE woolieLORE woolieLORE woolieLORE
[0:34:38] <GPAlpha> Judgment Mode!
[0:34:41] <KidKaiser23> Dragon Armor on Trini is an outfitted version of the Black Dragon Zord made by Lord Drakkon. It had the power to be remote controlled and shrink to human size or grow to Zord size. It was sentient too, they killed it and now Trini wears his skin like a suit
[0:35:00] <arurorablade> shes sentinel
[0:35:07] <Nilbanas> This game looks fun
[0:35:09] <+Afterman_> the comics can get fucking dark
[0:35:10] <SheefEatsBeef> TIMER SCAAM
[0:35:11] <Amardeux> yeah Zords and snap backing characters in for the kill
[0:35:12] <arurorablade> it is
[0:35:13] <KidKaiser23> It also had the power to destroy your connection to your Morphing Powers
[0:35:19] <+badjab326> You can do Marvel 3 level combos in this too
[0:35:37] <lewisfoster93> Hey Woolie only just tuned in what do you think to battle for the grid enjoying it?
[0:35:39] <+Afterman_> can we talk about how drakkon just murdered like most time force rangers and lost in space dudes? shit was wild
[0:35:47] <technicallyfootsies> Yeah, once you get to proper combos in the game, the damage goes off the chain
[0:35:57] <arurorablade> yes we can
[0:36:23] <%ggbhtg> Lost In Space? Who them? Kappa
[0:36:23] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1272752298469609473?s=20
[0:36:24] <Captain_Doomsday> Yo but where's Doggie Kruger?
[0:36:36] <arurorablade> im glad we get a shot of eric hugging jen
[0:36:36] <KidKaiser23> @captain_doomsday He’s in the game
[0:36:41] <%GeltonZ> @Captain_Doomsday He's in.
[0:36:43] <+Afterman_> and speaking of the comics, i sincererly hope they put dayne (red colored species of krugger) in the game
[0:36:46] <%ggbhtg> there's Power Rangers In Space, but they weren't lost Kappa
[0:36:50] <Captain_Doomsday> I know! I just want to see him on a match.
[0:36:53] <Mordexai0> @captain_doomsday in character select
[0:37:04] <arurorablade> lost galaxy
[0:37:05] <KidKaiser23> @afterman_ I would love to see that and Black Omega Ranger
[0:37:05] <+badjab326> Season 3 is happening for this game too!
[0:37:06] <+ZoltanBMagnus> @Captain_Doomsday they used him earlier
[0:37:09] <+Afterman_> @arurorablade that was hella emotional
[0:37:13] <%ggbhtg> @captain_doomsday shouldn't have been late yo
[0:37:16] <Captain_Doomsday> Damn.
[0:37:17] <%sonofthedeepsouth> WHITE POWER....ranger Kappa
[0:37:24] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Yo
[0:37:25] <+Afterman_> @KidKaiser23 give me all omega rangers. and solar rangers.
[0:37:27] <+akira_chong> Magna Defender's intro animation here is pretty sweet ngl
[0:37:28] <KidKaiser23> (Purple) Solar Ranger should be in here too
[0:37:38] <arurorablade> i use it as my discord icon with the caption tags: ntr
[0:37:48] <KidKaiser23> @afterman_ Yeah since they aren’t adapting Kyuranger, we should get sum Solar/Omega Ranger love
[0:37:57] <Captain_Doomsday> If we're wishing, I want Akibaranger.
[0:38:05] <fuzack> The hype is real
[0:38:08] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Oof
[0:38:12] <+agumon9000> Sentai only will never happen
[0:38:13] <BackwardCap> That throw looked painful
[0:38:15] <KidKaiser23> @captain_doomsday Oh you big wishin, Pimp lls
[0:38:15] <%SirGO0SE> this game is sick
[0:38:16] <+agumon9000> but the true crossover
[0:38:20] <+agumon9000> SABAN'S MASKED RIDER
[0:38:24] <+agumon9000> WE NEED KAMEN RIDER BLACK RX
[0:38:27] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Toku sentai
[0:38:27] <+UberWolfman> But can she rocket punch?
[0:38:28] <+demonkingk13> rancid needs to be in this
[0:38:32] <arurorablade> kamen rider dragon knight
[0:38:34] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Toku Sentai
[0:38:38] <%ggbhtg> Ransik*
[0:38:44] <+akira_chong> So what's the theme of Kyuranger?
[0:38:45] <+derpinurface> yo @woolieversus. u getting into this game?
[0:38:45] <arurorablade> YES WE DO NEED RANSIK
[0:38:46] <technicallyfootsies> Jump S
[0:38:48] <+agumon9000> Saban's Masked Rider had a crossover with MMRP season 3
[0:38:51] <BackwardCap> Reggie used Udonna in the first fight.
[0:38:54] <+Afterman_> ransik bodied the fuck out of time force. until he let himself get captured
[0:38:58] <arurorablade> i wish kamen rider didnt
[0:39:02] <Captain_Doomsday> @KidKaiser23 You ain't wrong. I'd settle for an actual 50-ep season of Akibaranger.
[0:39:04] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Zedd
[0:39:06] <Jeemukun> needs more megazord options
[0:39:14] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Lord Zedd cmon
[0:39:17] <arurorablade> i wouldnt mind q-rex tbh
[0:39:22] <+badjab326> @Jeemukun another one is coming out soon
[0:39:26] <huskarl_zap> heart tip WutFace
[0:39:26] <+badjab326> for free
[0:39:27] <+Afterman_> Jen best girl BibleThump
[0:39:31] <+roseshrimp> time for best pink ranger
[0:39:34] <Jeemukun> neat, do you know which one?
[0:39:50] <GHouseduivel> This looks like Slow MVC2
[0:39:52] <KidKaiser23> @akira_chong Instead of the Rangers fighting off evil, the universe is already lost and they gotta ban together while harnessing the power of constellations to destroy evil
[0:39:52] <technicallyfootsies> Samurai Megazord
[0:39:53] <Captain_Doomsday> Which was the best Megazord, anyway? Like, Engine-O G12 was insultingly OP, but is the coolest Magiranger's?
[0:39:55] <KidKaiser23> It’s like Voltron
[0:39:58] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Is that time force pink ranger
[0:40:06] <Who_lio42> yes
[0:40:12] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Time Force best season BTW
[0:40:14] <Oh_Gee_Man> Shoutouts to the Quantum Ranger
[0:40:14] <%GeltonZ> @GHouseduivel The devs are MvC2 fans so yeah.
[0:40:23] <KidKaiser23> There’s members of Kyuranger from different planets, sum actual Robots on the team too
[0:40:29] <+akira_chong> @KidKaiser23 I like that idea. Sounds very Gurren Lagann.
[0:40:31] <+badjab326> @Jeemukun not yet, but there is a Season 3 trailer up
[0:40:33] <technicallyfootsies> Yeah, was made by Clockwork and ShadyK
[0:40:39] <+mr_miyagichu> @GHouseduivel try looking at gameplay from people who play this a bit more regularly, it gets pretty nutty
[0:40:41] <arurorablade> wait what is dino force then
[0:40:46] <Captain_Doomsday> This is so weird. I know Mighty Morphin Power Rangers and Turbo, and then only Sentai.
[0:40:55] <+Afterman_> @Captain_Doomsday go check out the comics
[0:41:01] <+Afterman_> they make mmpr amazing
[0:41:06] <arurorablade> if you have netflix everything is on there
[0:41:06] <KidKaiser23> @akira_chong Yeah they fly around liberating planets, destroying reactors that are harvesting Planet life force
[0:41:06] <Captain_Doomsday> I totally forgot there were comics!
[0:41:11] <Azathotic> What's the PR series that had actual Sentai footage as a "show within the show"?
[0:41:12] <%ggbhtg> Dino Force is the Korean spinoff of Kyoryuranger
[0:41:14] <arurorablade> so if you wanna deep dive that and the ocmics
[0:41:22] <arurorablade> ninja storm
[0:41:23] <arurorablade> i think
[0:41:28] <+mr_miyagichu> I hear about some of what happens in the comics and it sound wild
[0:41:35] <Mordexai0> @ggbhtg you mean Dino Force Brave
[0:41:35] <Leafboi125> Reggie is getting worked
[0:41:36] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Ninja storm is okayish
[0:41:40] <arurorablade> i thought dino force is the american adaptation
[0:41:40] <+demonkingk13> also i want wolf ranger from jungle fury
[0:41:42] <Captain_Doomsday> Wait, I remember my #1 pull for dream character. Hiramekimedes.
[0:41:44] <%ggbhtg> Dino CHARGE is the US version
[0:41:50] <arurorablade> OOOOOOH RIGHT
[0:41:51] <Mordexai0> @azathotic Dino Thunder
[0:41:52] <arurorablade> wait no
[0:41:54] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @akira_chong
[0:41:56] <arurorablade> france 5 when
[0:42:07] <Azathotic> @Mordexai0 Thank you, thought I imagined that
[0:42:24] <Rada150> They should make Auric the Conqueror a zord option
[0:42:27] <Rada150> from zeo
[0:42:30] <+akira_chong> @KidKaiser23 Excuse me while I go to a site that totally isn't TV-Nihon
[0:42:45] <arurorablade> you mean not over time
[0:42:48] <%theman515> dino charge was baller
[0:42:51] <%fangovafang> AYYYEE LETS FUCKIN GO.
[0:42:56] <%theman515> super dino charge was better though
[0:42:57] <SjoeB89> Please guys look at the move lists. Lots of shit you guys arent using.
[0:42:58] <%yeknomlive> are there mods for this game to change music
[0:43:00] <arurorablade> i ironically started beast morphers recently
[0:43:07] <%ggbhtg> Dino Charge was soliiiiid
[0:43:09] <GrieverRexxIII> hullooo
[0:43:21] <+ZoltanBMagnus> Dino charge was fine, Dino Super charge was less so
[0:43:21] <+Afterman_> how is beast morphers? i know they are doing some anniversary stuff
[0:43:31] <arurorablade> so far its pretty good
[0:43:31] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:43:34] <%theman515> it's alright
[0:43:35] <%sonofthedeepsouth> They should have gone for the Rangers Civil War after In Space.
[0:43:36] <arurorablade> im like 3 eps in
[0:43:38] <Xenstroke> Beast Morphers alright so far
[0:43:39] <+NarcissistCactus> touch 17 times and still not coming
[0:43:42] <Rada150> well the fact the developers of this game are MVC2 players and fans yeah they took a ton from MVC series
[0:43:45] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Well it was fine
[0:43:47] <Tropicalhazard> beast morphers is good
[0:43:53] <Captain_Doomsday> MvC2 was my favorite MvC
[0:43:55] <+Afterman_> i might need to check it out
[0:44:02] <+RenoDeGeneric> Is that Dan Southworth?
[0:44:05] <arurorablade> yes
[0:44:05] <Rada150> yes
[0:44:07] <+Afterman_> yes
[0:44:09] <Xenstroke> Yea
[0:44:16] <%yeknomlive> his reprisal
[0:44:16] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Vergil beating ranger
[0:44:18] <+RenoDeGeneric> Wonderful
[0:44:18] <%fangovafang> magna defender MorphinTime MorphinTime MorphinTime MorphinTime dat is all lol
[0:44:19] <arurorablade> i took a power rangers deep dive when quarentine started recently.
[0:44:20] <Nilbanas> Vergil
[0:44:24] <TopLeftCenter> @WoolieVersus Yeah optimal stuff in this game is gonna kill a character in 2 or 3 touches. Some ToD stuff here and there too
[0:44:26] <+badjab326> Guys this game is dirt cheap on all platforms and has full crossplay, def check it out!
[0:44:31] <arurorablade> also i wish dan woulda came back for mega force
[0:44:34] <Rada150> Goldar, Tommy, Jason, and Eric Meyers all have their actors reprising their roles
[0:44:39] <MegaIsaacX> megais1STC megais1STC megais1STC
[0:44:41] <Mordexai0> @captain_doomsday Watch In Space, Time Force, and RPM for the best of their eras, then go watch Lightspeed Rescue, Ninja Storm, Dino Thunder, SPD, Jungle Fury, RPM, and if you are fine with watch d & D seasons Hyperforce is the best to come out of the Neo Saban era
[0:44:49] <%yeknomlive> the game is cheap but theres a lot of dlc. ive been wanting to get it but maybe when there's a sale
[0:44:56] <Mordexai0> sessions*
[0:45:08] <technicallyfootsies> It'll probably go on sale in a week or so when season 3 gets released
[0:45:08] <arurorablade> honestly what mord said
[0:45:09] <%ggbhtg> @mordexai0 is very much correct
[0:45:10] <Rada150> they Tried to get Axelrod to do Zed but he had cancer and unfortunately died
[0:45:10] <Nilbanas> @badjab326 I'm saving 10$ for when it goes on sale next time :)
[0:45:11] <%theman515> in space and lost galaxy were goats
[0:45:19] <%DukeBlack_> mystic force was cool too
[0:45:20] <arurorablade> fuck now im sad
[0:45:31] <+badjab326> I think the Switch version is on sale rn
[0:45:42] <Mordexai0> @captain_doomsday ALSO FORGOT Watch Lost Galaxy. I meant to write that but my phone fucked up
[0:45:52] <%ggbhtg> RIP Udonna, Zedd, Trini, Shane...
[0:45:57] <Rada150> Ecliptor, Villamax and Zen Aku need to come in as playable villains
[0:45:58] <arurorablade> lost galaxy is a great sword and sorcery
[0:46:03] <%fangovafang> damn i be forgettin da zord even exist in this game 🤦🏽♂️
[0:46:10] <+Afterman_> Rip Shane BibleThump
[0:46:15] <ashenjuan25> I need more quantum power
[0:46:20] <+akira_chong> what the hell are "d & D seasons" @Mordexai0
[0:46:20] <Captain_Doomsday> @Mordexai0 Man, I've got so much to watch. I want to go back through ReBoot after learning from Woolie that it's free online. I've seen Go-Onger, Magiranger, and Shinkenger though.
[0:46:24] <Mordexai0> @ggbhtg Shane's actor beat his wife so....
[0:46:28] <Rada150> also Red Ranger from ninja storm died
[0:46:34] <arurorablade> dont watch the 2010 re release of mmpr
[0:46:39] <+Afterman_> @Mordexai0 Really? Goddamn thats fucked up
[0:46:46] <Captain_Doomsday> That movie clearly sucked. I didn't need to actually look.
[0:46:46] <%ggbhtg> @rada150 That's "Shane"
[0:46:46] <%yeknomlive> tommy apparently went undefeated in ufc
[0:46:49] <%theman515> HE NEEDS MORE POWER
[0:46:50] <%anthonywilde1994> I need more power!
[0:46:56] <arurorablade> he died the year after the team up
[0:46:59] <Captain_Doomsday> Wait, no...there's a 2010 rerelease?
[0:47:01] <Amardeux> so Reggie EVO Champ for Battle for the Grid?
[0:47:02] <%anthonywilde1994> foolishness
[0:47:04] <+RealPT1> he's just virgil
[0:47:06] <arurorablade> yeah. its bad
[0:47:07] <%theman515> @yeknomlive yeah for 3 matchs
[0:47:16] <arurorablade> its the first 30ish eps
[0:47:24] <arurorablade> covered in glitter and effects basically
[0:47:26] <TeethMuncher> Have they played dai shi?
[0:47:29] <+Jaysky> I need more quantum power
[0:47:29] <Leafboi125> Bro woolie got rocked
[0:47:32] <Nicholasgerald1> I NEED MORE QUANTUM POWER
[0:47:34] <Captain_Doomsday> Oh, the English Character names are depressing. Not the ranger names.
[0:47:38] <Xenstroke> Trini and Goldar together in a team is busted
[0:47:39] <+Afterman_> @Jaysky woolie did iirc
[0:47:53] <%yeknomlive> it's would be jyb
[0:47:54] <+Afterman_> err @TeethMuncher i mean
[0:47:58] <Mordexai0> @afterman_ Yeah she talked about it after he commited suicide, apparently he was very protective of his image
[0:48:03] <Rada150> You would think with Hasbros funding they would try an animated series for PR with their own stuff and designs ala Voltron
[0:48:06] <+RealPT1> is the trini armor from a comic or something?
[0:48:06] <%fangovafang> Kat ranger is slept on too
[0:48:13] <+Afterman_> @Mordexai0 thats so sad to hear :(
[0:48:13] <+the22cstomp> yes
[0:48:13] <Rada150> yes comic
[0:48:14] <%yeknomlive> is that the grappler?
[0:48:19] <%Jetzord> Yes
[0:48:26] <Who_lio42> Doggie is better if you forget he has normals
[0:48:28] <%yeknomlive> ooo what a grapple that is
[0:48:30] <Captain_Doomsday> Animation costs money. Recycling already-cheap tokusatsu is efficient.
[0:48:31] <GHouseduivel> I appreciate the hype shit going on in the background but it is far too distracting
[0:48:35] <%yeknomlive> wallbounce is pretty sick
[0:48:41] <+Jaysky> @Afterman_ I bet Woolie also wanted more quantum power too
[0:48:43] <Rada150> I think Ninjor would be the Parry character for this game
[0:48:51] <arurorablade> PLZ PUT NINJOR IN
[0:49:00] <Mordexai0> Also Operation Overdrive and Megaforce don't exist. We don't talk about them. Don't even touch them with a yard stick
[0:49:00] <%ggbhtg> And the Overdrive Black Ranger DIDN'T steal that poster from Power Morphicon
[0:49:02] <anuchallengertwitch> Lord Drakkon is so cool
[0:49:06] <Who_lio42> FUCK NINJOR
[0:49:13] <rad_dude123465> Doggie can do some sick looking combos using his stance/ stance canceling
[0:49:14] <%ChoculaUltra> this makes me want a Garo fighting game
[0:49:17] <arurorablade> i will if he conesents
[0:49:19] <ULT_13> put in my homie SIGNAL MAN
[0:49:29] <Doublemint_Dave_> This big fella is really cool
[0:49:29] <arurorablade> the blue senturian
[0:49:36] <+Afterman_> So, who here is caught up w. the comics? I have a BIG theory on the upcoming new big bad
[0:49:36] <Doublemint_Dave_> I like the maxima esque grab
[0:49:37] <Rada150> also if they wanted you could use alot of Reptile and scorpion moves for Phantom Ranger, like invisible and across stage tp
[0:49:41] <+RealPT1> yeah, I love signal man even if he is a cop
[0:49:43] <Captain_Doomsday> There's a lot of regen in this game.
[0:49:43] <+akira_chong> @Mordexai0 Oh so Megaforce really WAS that bad?
[0:49:47] <Mordexai0> @ggbhtg Well that's what he said. It's still very vague what happened
[0:49:47] <arurorablade> yes
[0:49:50] <arurorablade> its a disaster
[0:49:52] <%yeknomlive> so is johnny yong bosch the black ranger or is that a different one
[0:49:54] <Mordexai0> @akira_chong Yes
[0:50:01] <Captain_Doomsday> Is that the MMPR Black Ranger with a sniper rifle?
[0:50:08] <Who_lio42> I would Ninjor too if only he wouldnt talk
[0:50:12] <+Afterman_> @yeknomlive this is a mastodon sentry. not jyb. thinnk of a random hencman mook
[0:50:12] <arurorablade> imagine taking goseiger and then going "well we wanted gokaiger tho" then fucked it up
[0:50:17] <Xenstroke> It's not the black ranger
[0:50:19] <anuchallengertwitch> I just finished watching Comicstorian's Black dragon origin, so I now realized what that Black dragon armor is from
[0:50:20] <%yeknomlive> dam it wouldve been too cool
[0:50:20] <+Jasuchin> So, Green Lightspeed Ranger when?
[0:50:23] <Xenstroke> he's a dentry soldier
[0:50:24] <Rada150> if you don't recognize the character it's from the BOOM comics series shattered grid
[0:50:27] <Xenstroke> sentry*
[0:50:33] <arurorablade> sorry
[0:50:33] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:50:38] <+Afterman_> he is a bad henchman
[0:51:02] <%ggbhtg> Megaforce was mediocre, Super Megaforce is not only a bad Gokaiger, it's the WORST Power Rangers by a country mile
[0:51:04] <Mordexai0> @ggbhtg Like, I want to believe him, but there is still some missing pieces in his story.
[0:51:04] <anuchallengertwitch> That black ranger entry is from thelord drakkon timeline too.
[0:51:08] <ashenjuan25> You picked the wrong house
[0:51:11] <Who_lio42> TJ should come in and be able to take different ranger forms
[0:51:13] <+badjab326> Make sure you guys turn on crossplay in the settings before online
[0:51:15] <+RealPT1> man, just put all of the not a ranger characters, Ninjor, Phantom Ranger/VRV Master, Signal Man etc
[0:51:20] <Rada150> also i think Blue Centurion would play like the character with a random facor moves
[0:51:20] <arurorablade> saban more or less purpsfully fucked over mega force because they wanted to pull mmpr shit
[0:51:21] <Leafboi125> You're on the wrong side of history
[0:51:29] <+akira_chong> Honestly it goes beyond that. I don't know what it is, but the entire acting and filming style in the Disney and Neo Saban eras rubbed me the wrong way.
[0:51:32] <Rada150> factor*
[0:51:49] <%yeknomlive> you guys hear about the fucked up bullying they did to billy the blue ranger's actor
[0:51:55] <%DukeBlack_> was kat's suit always like that?
[0:51:57] <arurorablade> sadly
[0:51:59] <arurorablade> also eys
[0:52:00] <Mordexai0> @yeknomlive Yeah. Fuck Saban
[0:52:04] <Captain_Doomsday> Oh yeah. That's fairly common trivia.
[0:52:10] <+Afterman_> @yeknomlive i heard it was mostly the production crew, and the actual actors themselves were cool with him, not sure how legit tho
[0:52:13] <arurorablade> yosy deserved so much better
[0:52:16] <Captain_Doomsday> It was even covered in Honest Trailers. It's awful though.
[0:52:17] <halfmasks> fuck haim saban
[0:52:34] <+akira_chong> @yeknomlive Yup! Did you know that one of the biggest perpetrators of said bullying was Tommy's actor?
[0:52:48] <Rada150> disney was hit or miss with series the best it did was give New Zealand a reliable source of income, ne saban was pretty bad until hasbro bought it though ive heard the first season of dino charge was good
[0:52:59] <+RealPT1> so how did disney not make money on Power Rangers? did they not know how to market it?
[0:53:05] <Belakitu> lytMOTIVATED lytMOTIVATED lytMOTIVATED
[0:53:05] <%yeknomlive> @akira_chong dam that sucks
[0:53:07] <Mordexai0> Also Haim Saban basically screwed with every actor on that crossover episode in Megaforce
[0:53:10] <BreakersAweigh> !motivated
[0:53:10] <@Moobot> 1321 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[0:53:12] <Jathspuh> Pushblock is stronk bois
[0:53:12] <%ggbhtg> A lot of PR actors don't mind coming to conventions, but like with people in general, 10%-15% of the main cast got problems
[0:53:13] <arurorablade> they just lost more money with it
[0:53:33] <arurorablade> does jdf and asj still hate eachother
[0:53:40] <+parzano> best crossover episode?
[0:53:46] <halfmasks> @Mordexai0 you mean the hypest shit was ruined by a greedy businessman? not surprised
[0:53:46] <Who_lio42> Forver Red
[0:53:49] <%ChoculaUltra> so you're saying Saban was the real Rita Repulsa the whole time
[0:53:55] <+Afterman_> @parzano forever red
[0:53:55] <Rada150> Disney didn't know how to market properly this was before they bought marvel
[0:53:57] <%yeknomlive> ibuki
[0:54:01] <%ggbhtg> Forever Red, free, still free, always free
[0:54:03] <halfmasks> the comics are so sick with too
[0:54:12] <+Afterman_> also the turtle showing up in power rangers were cool
[0:54:15] <+Afterman_> turtles*
[0:54:16] <arurorablade> disney just didnt do anything to advertise it
[0:54:17] <+akira_chong> Why do Sentai actors seem incapable of making a non-forced facial expression?
[0:54:21] <%ggbhtg> @choculaultra 10 billion percent yes
[0:54:23] <+parzano> is the Shattered Grid comic good for someone like me who isnt like super informed on rangers?
[0:54:26] <+RealPT1> I saw some tweets about one of the actors almost died in an apartment fire a friend of saban's owned
[0:54:32] <+Afterman_> @parzano yes. check it out asap
[0:54:35] <+parzano> does the comic have good emotional stories
[0:54:35] <jellssssss20> which one is acab ranger?
[0:54:35] <arurorablade> they also aired at weird times
[0:54:44] <Who_lio42> OOs cross over ep was ok. as one of the only good things about that show was getting rid of the main cast for an ep
[0:54:51] <+Afterman_> @parzano start with go go power rangers and read it in conjuction with mmpr
[0:55:02] <halfmasks> yo i wish they had names on these rangers cause i dont recognize this white ranger
[0:55:06] <%yeknomlive> @akira_chong i noticed that in like anime adaptations to live actions where they have this painfully exaggerated expressions. prison school for example
[0:55:13] <TeethMuncher> oh boy
[0:55:16] <+parzano> @Afterman_ are those both seprate comics?
[0:55:18] <huskarl_zap> over lapping audio psaDown
[0:55:18] <+badjab326> Turn on crossplay!
[0:55:26] <%ggbhtg> @mordexai0 IRL?
[0:55:30] <+Jasuchin> Zyuranger!
[0:55:33] <Leafboi125> LET'S GO!!
[0:55:34] <+McSoliace> turn on crossplay
[0:55:37] <arurorablade> it probably doesnt help that they dont own full rights
[0:55:42] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Forever Red exists
[0:55:43] <arurorablade> forever black?
[0:55:45] <morningmoondude> forever black is in the comics
[0:55:49] <%yeknomlive> yes jyb was in there
[0:55:51] <%sonofthedeepsouth> AND IT WAS GREAT
[0:55:51] <GHouseduivel> LUL
[0:55:51] <arurorablade> OOOOOOOOOOOH
[0:55:52] <SjoeB89> Time Ranger is actually the virgil of the rangers.
[0:55:54] <+Jasuchin> What about Forever Green?
[0:55:58] <%GeltonZ> Man I hope we got some good players online today.
[0:55:59] <+akira_chong> @yeknomlive I'm pretty sure it's down to the crash in the Japanese film industry. There aren't really any good young actors in Japan anymore.
[0:56:02] <iiyodeshou> He's talking about the white ranger that was using ice magic
[0:56:03] <kei_ar_> no forever black but JYB was lead in a anniversary
[0:56:09] <arurorablade> THE 35+ HENSHINS IN ONE COMBO
[0:56:09] <morningmoondude> Gokaiger
[0:56:09] <Xenstroke> Gokaiger
[0:56:12] <Xenstroke> the movie
[0:56:16] <Belakitu> GOKAIGER
[0:56:16] <%redrins> yeah gokaiger
[0:56:17] <halfmasks> @yeknomlive its already hard to recreate the overexaggerated drawings in real life, its just a problem with 2D to 3D transitions
[0:56:17] <+NYCrownlessKing> Gokaiger, he's a pirate that steals keys that let him turn into any ranger @WoolieVersus
[0:56:18] <%joeobo2> Gokaiger
[0:56:21] <Xenstroke> 30+ in 7 minutes
[0:56:24] <KaironFortressKnight> fuck yeah Gokaiger
[0:56:24] <lovesosa236> genkso 34 it's a great video people should check out
[0:56:25] <%anthonywilde1994> megaforce?
[0:56:30] <SjoeB89> Quantum Ranger I mean
[0:56:31] <@Solidus_113> Gokaiger 35 on youtube
[0:56:32] <Axle13j> that sounds fucking awesome
[0:56:33] <lovesosa236> sorry genkai I think
[0:56:34] <%CaptainPileDriver> power rangers has megaforce tht literally does that
[0:56:47] <arurorablade> it doesnt though
[0:56:52] <Belakitu> Man fuck Megaforce
[0:56:55] <+NYCrownlessKing> They also have that for Kamen Rider Kappa
[0:56:57] <Leafboi125> I remember the megaforce one
[0:56:59] <Jeemukun> yeah, Gokaiger is an anniversary series full of references and old actors
[0:57:04] <+miyoles> Megaforce is fine guys
[0:57:04] <%kyh9> we playing online?
[0:57:08] <%ChoculaUltra> so uh, how bout them Psycho Rangers from Space
[0:57:09] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Love this theme
[0:57:09] <lovesosa236> its dante style switching check it out
[0:57:16] <%redrins> the gokaiger toy announcer was the shit, the way he says GOKAIJA is the best
[0:57:16] <weirdducks> are ya winning son
[0:57:20] <%joeobo2> Psychos were the best!
[0:57:22] <%yeknomlive> @akira_chong that's really interesting
[0:57:24] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Might Morphin still great
[0:57:26] <arurorablade> i wish saban did that and not shat on gokaiger
[0:57:26] <Who_lio42> Megaforce even still used the rangers that never showed in the West
[0:57:28] <Leafboi125> It finr
[0:57:28] <Rada150> it was funny cause PR megaforce had no idea how to represent old sentai series that never had American representation
[0:57:31] <%ggbhtg> BIIIIIIO MAN
[0:57:36] <Captain_Doomsday> I roped a friend into Lupin vs. Pat because it's so much like Persona 5
[0:57:36] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:57:39] <%vaporousTippler> Gamestop worked fine for me!
[0:57:40] <kei_ar_> JAAAAYTO MAN
[0:57:43] <arurorablade> why did mega force do that
[0:57:43] <%GeltonZ> GameStop corporate is shit, but some stores have good people working at them. Some don't.
[0:57:49] <SjoeB89> Getting their employees arrested and sick is bullshit no matter how you look at ti..
[0:57:53] <Rada150> Or the fact that Turbo which was carrranger in japan was a comedy series
[0:58:03] <iiyodeshou> Megaforce was a the worst thing ever. Don't defend that bs
[0:58:03] <SomersaultJustice> the gamestop I used to go to had chill people working there
[0:58:07] <%SirGO0SE> PogChamp
[0:58:15] <Rada150> and when they had their moment in Supermegaforce it made absolutely no sense cause it was japanese humor
[0:58:15] <Captain_Doomsday> They switched Go-Onger to serious in NA though so it evens out
[0:58:24] <%ggbhtg> Super Megaforce didn't even allow the main cast to have character arcs. The producer just cared about marketing the toys.
[0:58:26] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Go Ranger

[0:59:22] <+akira_chong> All the good actors are like middle-aged because they got experience in before the crash
[0:59:23] <%ggbhtg> did they TURN ON CROSSPLAY btw?
[0:59:27] <+Afterman_> @halfmasks correct
[0:59:29] <Rada150> hey supposedly some Sentai Actresses who played villains did some pornos before they joined sentai

[1:00:51] <+BestTeaMaker> woolie, ready up
[1:00:51] <Rada150> One thing i am disappointed in this game is lack of memorable music like i could only find MMPR and SPD theme remixes but none of the other series and you could literally make the soundtrack of PR series themes and some select songs and everyone would be fine
[1:00:53] <halfmasks> are there cowboy power rangers
[1:00:59] <crimsonsaens> Ready up Woolie

[1:02:54] <%CaptainPileDriver> i just want the white ranger from dinothunder and maybe some ninjastorm love with either their green ranger or one of the storm ninjas
[1:03:01] <Mordexai0> @mattdemers Carter Grayson is legit the GOAT Red
[1:03:28] <Rada150> You know for ninja storm you could do Android 18/krillen move set from DBZ fighters with the Thunder Brothers

[1:03:51] <Mordexai0> @jasuchin The Sky Cowboy Joel?

[1:05:56] <+Voidwyvern> Should I back out for others now?
[1:05:56] <anuchallengertwitch> @GeltonZ good point. I'd just think it would be cool to have those two franchises interact with how VASTLY they contrast each other.

[1:06:35] <Amardeux> if you think about it, ,setting up teams before the fight saves alot of time
[1:06:40] <Rada150> also why do they never have a Brown Ranger, japan needs to stop making brown teh joke color
[1:07:06] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Where is Majenta ranger?

[1:07:13] <+akira_chong> I mean it's the color of mud and dookie, @Rada150

[1:07:17] <+TheOneCalledRock> remember when the black ranger used to be black OpieOP
[1:07:22] <%sonofthedeepsouth> teal ranger?
[1:07:23] <arurorablade> solar ranger
[1:07:24] <+ZoltanBMagnus> @ChoculaUltra they do

[1:07:43] <Amardeux> ah I didn't mean for it to be a jab at you BibleThump
[1:07:47] <+Afterman_> gonna eat and shower, hope this is still going when i get back!
[1:07:49] <Rada150> @akira_chong and Green is the color of vomit and yellow is the color of piss what is your point, brown can also be chocolate and wood
[1:07:49] <NathanTZ> Trying to get in there too.
[1:07:51] <Amardeux> but just explaining why it would be like that
[1:08:04] <%redrins> @ChoculaUltra thats toqger iirc
[1:08:08] <DeathByPoke7> invisible sword
[1:08:08] <artificiallynatural> red is one of the best characters in the game. he does everything you need pretty much
[1:08:08] <+Jaysky> Motivated
[1:08:10] <sackerkappa> These cowards won't put Alpha in the game as a playable character because they know he'll be OP.
[1:08:13] <%kyh9> invisible sword lmao
[1:08:15] <+demonkingk13> only teal i remember is shark ranger thing from jungle fury
[1:08:16] <BackwardCap> Invisible Sword glitch is still in the game?
[1:08:17] <%DensityD> "be sure to look at my ass while I shoot"
[1:08:21] <arurorablade> here comes the infinite train
[1:08:21] <halfmasks> !motivated
[1:08:21] <@Moobot> 1322 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[1:08:23] <anuchallengertwitch> Oh my god, I forgot how much quantuum ranger is just vergil in this game
[1:08:31] <crimsonsaens> Red has some problems getting in
[1:08:38] <%CaptainPileDriver> that is a grab
[1:08:41] <Amardeux> man the Goon noises are great
[1:08:43] <Amardeux> LUL
[1:08:46] <%CaptainPileDriver> and it comes from behind you
[1:08:46] <+BestTeaMaker> @WoolieVersus that super is activated from behind you
[1:08:50] <anuchallengertwitch> @sackerkappa as long as he goes aiyaiyaiyaiayiai after his super.
[1:08:52] <DianaTheAscian> it come from behind it seems
[1:08:52] <+TheOneCalledRock> red is the only ranger that I can do long combos with LUL
[1:08:58] <sackerkappa> Yeah...
[1:09:00] <arurorablade> most chars can
[1:09:08] <+BestTeaMaker> I miss kat's no-meter infinite
[1:09:16] <+akira_chong> @Rada150 I guess my point is that it's not really a color a significant number of kids say is their "favorite" so it's not really that marketable
[1:09:19] <BurdRightsActivist> Are they still milking Mighty Morphin?
[1:09:20] <BackwardCap> If you're at the edge of the screen on the ground it's instant
[1:09:23] <Rada150> they have used Grey, orange, 4 different shades of blue (teal, indigo, cyan and regular blue) and violet, they can do brown
[1:09:35] <anuchallengertwitch> @TheOneCalledRock main character privilege
[1:09:36] <%CaptainPileDriver> with this we now no longer have to play injustice
[1:09:49] <Jeemukun> there's been an actual brown in Sentai I wanna sya twice?
[1:09:51] <%ChoculaUltra> I was a huge Silver Ranger mark. It's all about those weird one-off color rangers.
[1:10:03] <anuchallengertwitch> They should put Rita Repulsa in this game too
[1:10:09] <Rada150> @akira_chong yeah but if you look at sentai, their default color for almost the last decade has been gold or silver while marketable it's bland and overused
[1:10:11] <halfmasks> dude the quantum ranger to this day is my fave
[1:10:27] <+BestTeaMaker> @anuchallengertwitch they're adding everyone but rita repulsa, if scorpina as the next dlc is anything to go by LUL
[1:10:28] <Rada150> @akira_chong for the sixth ranger i mean
[1:10:35] <+TheOneCalledRock> wasn't there episode where they made jabs about the red ranger getting and doing everything LUL
[1:10:40] <+demonkingk13> wait it dawned on me slzed has gordeau moves
[1:10:42] <arurorablade> trini is the wind maker
[1:10:46] <+Jasuchin> THAT JUGGLE!

[1:10:46] <Jeemukun> huh, yeah as it happens the next power rangers season is gonna have the first real brown ranger
[1:10:48] <arurorablade> shit changes when shes on screen
[1:10:48] <halfmasks> THAT WAS SICK
[1:10:49] <+Jasuchin> HOLY SHIT
[1:10:51] <BurdRightsActivist> Still waiting for Carter Grayson to get some represnation
[1:10:54] <%SirGO0SE> thats rad as fuk
[1:11:00] <+akira_chong> Also the bad guy in Kyuranger is apparently called "Jark Matter" and I am so here for that
[1:11:01] <%CaptainPileDriver> super is just a button for me
[1:11:03] <anuchallengertwitch> @BestTeaMaker did they say specifically that they couldn't/won't add her or something?
[1:11:04] <+agoaj> TIM Ex
[1:11:04] <DeathByPoke7> there is no level 3
[1:11:06] <crimsonsaens> There are no level 3's
[1:11:08] <+BestTeaMaker> not really
[1:11:11] <+BestTeaMaker> LUL
[1:11:12] <+Jasuchin> I wouldn't even be mad if that kicked my ass. Holy fuck
[1:11:19] <+BestTeaMaker> they're just not adding rita
[1:11:19] <+Voidwyvern> @WoolieVersus GG I'm Leo that was good fun!
[1:11:23] <crimsonsaens> super is H+S
[1:11:24] <%ChoculaUltra> Bulk & Skull as megazord assists when

[1:11:28] <+Goku01899> What is the code?
[1:11:29] <%ggbhtg> Dan Southworth basically asked for line suggestions on social media before coming in to voice here
[1:11:30] <halfmasks> we need someone on that quantum ranger for maximum E D G E
[1:11:31] <%Jetzord> Intisar

[1:11:57] <+cvit_> if you are playing trini, mega goldar and her have a two button infinite
[1:12:01] <%CaptainPileDriver> of course
[1:12:03] <anuchallengertwitch> @BestTeaMaker They should add Rita and basically make her the Nine the Phantom of the game.
[1:12:05] <TheZearGuy> God, this music is so good lol
[1:12:08] <halfmasks> YO LETS GO
[1:12:11] <%SirGO0SE> jetzord team is swag

[1:12:13] <Belakitu> Ranger Ryu is SICK
[1:12:14] <DeathByPoke7> Ryu ranger is cool
[1:12:17] <Mordexai0> Also they crossed over with TMNT twice
[1:12:22] <%CaptainPileDriver> the rangers are so fucking cool
[1:12:28] <SomersaultJustice> they aren't in this game right
[1:12:29] <anuchallengertwitch> @WoolieVersus there's also a power rangers/TMNT crossover. It's sick
[1:12:29] <+Jasuchin> Ranger Chunners looks SO FUCKING COOL!
[1:12:30] <Rada150> They just crossed over with TMNT in the comics
[1:12:31] <+BaronVonFatty> they made a green ranger shredder
[1:12:46] <%ggbhtg> Copyright law is fucking stupid, how is Ryu STILL NOT IN THIS GAME
[1:12:51] <anuchallengertwitch> @BaronVonFatty Green ranger shredder is so FUCKING COOL
[1:12:56] <Xenstroke> Dude the green ranger shredder is so SICK
[1:13:00] <+Voidwyvern> @WoolieVersus btw I was on Switch wi fi if anyone ever talks about how more fightning games don't need rollback lol
[1:13:08] <+TheOneCalledRock> @Rada150 they also had a TV special too
[1:13:15] <GarbageNirvana> What do you MEAN he drowned in pools
[1:13:16] <%ChoculaUltra> Ranger Ryu being tempted by the Satsui no Hado could be an arc all on it's own
[1:13:29] <+TheOneCalledRock> i should know because it had a female turtle with the team
[1:13:32] <halfmasks> is dai shi just akuma as a power ranger
[1:13:34] <arurorablade> i love that bison kidnaps ninjor
[1:13:36] <anuchallengertwitch> You know what fuck it. I want a Evangelion/Power rangers crossover. I don't care that it's stupid, have the NERV crew become rangers.
[1:13:36] <+TheOneCalledRock> i think her name was mona lisa?
[1:13:45] <+BestTeaMaker> @halfmasks no he's more wolverine/black panther
[1:13:45] <%ggbhtg> @theonecalledrock DON'T, talk about, that shitty crossover

[1:13:46] <%CaptainPileDriver> now we playing deadshot
[1:13:51] <%Pookiedaexzile> Whens M.Bisons Zed skin
[1:13:56] <Rada150> @TheOneCalledRock that was with the next mutation which we don't talk about because the next mutation was an abomination
[1:14:02] <NathanTZ> Digging Rio’s alt palette
[1:14:03] <%Pookiedaexzile> Whens Balrogs ranger skin
[1:14:10] <NathanTZ> I mean Dai Shi
[1:14:12] <crimsonsaens> Don't juggle with lights, they cause flip outs
[1:14:13] <%RyTYoung> holy fuck Ryu Ranger is badass

[1:14:44] <arurorablade> when you see devil man
[1:14:50] <huskarl_zap> lol that kick
[1:14:55] <+akira_chong> It's probably a really good thing that Street Fighter made a point of having its big Chinese rep have a strong cultural connection to China while pretty clearly not having a strong allegiance to the Chinese government
[1:15:04] <crimsonsaens> Trini can combo 5S into super
[1:15:08] <+Goku01899> Is there a queue to play in the lobby?
[1:15:09] <%SirGO0SE> zordon is pogging
[1:15:13] <%RyTYoung> Zordon my boy
[1:15:29] <%Pookiedaexzile> Chunky lil bih
[1:15:31] <Belakitu> "That was pretty Poggers Rangers!"
[1:15:36] <Mordexai0> Street Fighter also once crossed over with Space Sheriff Gavan
[1:15:46] <%Jetzord> Well that was bad
[1:15:49] <%Jetzord> fuck
[1:15:50] <anuchallengertwitch> I'd like a Eva/power rangers crossover mainly for the reactions : the rangers do their thing with shouting out all of there moves while being cool, and the Eva kids are all like "What the fuck are they doing?and why is it working so well?"
[1:15:56] <%CaptainPileDriver> k
[1:16:06] <%ggbhtg> tppowerAIYIYI tppowerAIYIYI tppowerAIYIYI tppowerAIYIYI tppowerAIYIYI
[1:16:13] <arurorablade> excuse you on that gavan
[1:16:15] <crimsonsaens> You forgot to switch characters again
[1:16:17] <Belakitu> Anyone else hear Simple and Clean during a part in the theme?
[1:16:23] <zakor1138> @Mordexai0 That's nothing, Ryu was in the American Dad vs. Family Guy web game
[1:16:30] <+Goku01899> What is the code?
[1:16:32] <%RyTYoung> And remember to social distance when queuing Kappa
[1:16:34] <%ggbhtg> SELECT TO MAKE YOUR FIRST PICK GUYS
[1:16:41] <arurorablade> i cant believe ryu is part of the family guy universe
[1:16:42] <crimsonsaens> @Goku01899 no code
[1:16:47] <+akira_chong> GET IT ON NOW
[1:16:54] <unit24> @Belakitu I've been hearing that too, it's fucking with me
[1:17:10] <anuchallengertwitch> @unit24 I kind of hear it in the chorus
[1:17:15] <%SirGO0SE> woolieGLORY woolieGLORY woolieGLORY
[1:17:17] <Belakitu> @unit24 RIGHT?! Its not just me!
[1:17:23] <NathanTZ> Now I wait for the lobby to open...
[1:17:27] <+TheOneCalledRock> you we doing COMBOS>
[1:17:30] <Rada150> Eva has tried to crossover with several things, Godzilla, transformers problem is Eva at it's core is a social commentary so everything thats less serious is akward
[1:17:34] <halfmasks> wall to wall baybee
[1:18:04] <+TheOneCalledRock> we got some killers in the chat
[1:18:12] <zakor1138> @Rada150 Godzilla can be serious
[1:18:23] <%SirGO0SE> LIGHT PUNCH
[1:18:23] <halfmasks> see:shin godzilla
[1:18:27] <+TheOneCalledRock> GOD DAMN
[1:18:35] <anuchallengertwitch> @Rada150 true. But as a positive, the characters themselves have been shown to play off of other Super Robot characters well, mainly in SRW games
[1:18:44] <Mordexai0> Power Rangers also crossed with BeetleBorgs in a Comic once
[1:19:12] <+badjab326> GG!
[1:19:12] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:19:20] <%YakumoYomi> The original 1954 Godzilla was essentially social commentary on the dangers of atomic weapons. Aside from that, nearly every other film in the franchise was a "popcorn flick".
[1:19:27] <crimsonsaens> Remember to change your controls too
[1:19:28] <%Malik1002> MAN Reggie Making woolie account look bad lol
[1:19:49] <TeethMuncher> select?
[1:19:53] <+McSoliace> different button?
[1:19:54] <crimsonsaens> You didn't select your final character Reggie
[1:19:59] <%CaptainPileDriver> try select?
[1:20:09] <Mordexai0> You didn't select the final character
[1:20:16] <%ggbhtg> There was a PR Turbo and Beetleborgs comic, but it probably sucked
[1:20:28] <%ggbhtg> it was in Linkara's review pile soooo
[1:20:37] <Mordexai0> @ggbhtg Still a neat little mention
[1:20:42] <zakor1138> There was going to be a Power Rangers Zeo crossover with Youngblood
[1:20:44] <huskarl_zap> linkara WutFace
[1:20:45] <Mordexai0> It was ass still
[1:20:52] <zakor1138> but it got canned
[1:21:04] <zakor1138> probably for the best
[1:21:07] <halfmasks> for some reason the lips on some of the helmets creep me the hell out
[1:21:14] <%ggbhtg> Did anyone know that Carter was GOAT status BEFORE Linkara mentioned it?
[1:21:37] <Mordexai0> @ggbhtg Carter was ALWAYS the goat.
[1:22:01] <%SirGO0SE> AYAYA
[1:22:07] <%ggbhtg> tppowerAIYIYI tppowerAIYIYI tppowerAIYIYI tppowerAIYIYI
[1:22:10] <huskarl_zap> only thing I know about linkara is everyone makes fun of him
[1:22:12] <%Zayasu> cirAYAYA
[1:22:17] <+Goku01899> Yes
[1:22:17] <Mordexai0> Man tried to run over a monster with a jeep umorphed

[1:23:18] <+arcielardor> holy shit this is more than I expected
[1:23:34] <Floofiie> Yeah Daishi is a villain with a power ranger suit, infused with the power of some chaotic ancient dragon
[1:23:45] <%CaptainPileDriver> THAT DUDE HAS FUCKING WEKSERS SUPER
[1:23:47] <+ZoltanBMagnus> @anuchallengertwitch He is Dai Shi. He is from Jungle Fury and is the Kylo Ren of Pwoer rangers but done right

[1:25:26] <Floofiie> Rita would be cool, maybe have a 2016 movie skin for her since elizabeth banks rocks the look
[1:25:34] <halfmasks> ZEDD GANG
[1:25:35] <Belakitu> LUL OH MY GOD
[1:25:35] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[1:25:36] <TeethMuncher> "Zedd" isn't real
[1:25:38] <+ChrisAlgoo> I thought Zedd was just his name lol
[1:25:48] <Axle13j> yeah just thought it was his name
[1:25:50] <TeethMuncher> Zedd is an alien word, it's fine
[1:25:51] <+lordreginald> wait...zedd's not just his name?
[1:25:51] <crimsonsaens> No one got bothered by that
[1:25:52] <+TheOneCalledRock> yeah i just thought his name was Zedd
[1:25:53] <JanusII> No we just thought that was his name.
[1:25:54] <+jiggy_snipe> nope
[1:25:55] <Belakitu> It never occurred to me, I thought it was just his name
[1:25:56] <CrazyDanceMacabre> Nah
[1:25:56] <%GeltonZ> I also thought it was his name.
[1:26:02] <+jiggy_snipe> its a just a name
[1:26:04] <anuchallengertwitch> good thing Zed just sounds cool as a name
[1:26:06] <+balouie> I stopped watching the show after rita was gone
[1:26:12] <+agoaj> Zedd was an original American creation, not adapted from Sentai, and he's the coolest monster
[1:26:12] <%RyTYoung> Z
[1:26:12] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:26:29] <+TheSynthHussar> Dr. Zed
[1:26:31] <+Goku01899> We were speaking French the whole time?! PogChamp
[1:26:37] <TeethMuncher> Lord Z sounds lame though
[1:26:38] <%ggbhtg> Lord Z? Smh
[1:26:43] <JanusII> Like we don't call him Lord Z we type Zed.
[1:26:43] <huskarl_zap> ZEDSU SAMA
[1:26:44] <+agoaj> LordZ
[1:26:45] <Sulliman34> its hidden missles, it used to be better
[1:26:46] <+ZoltanBMagnus> Cool thing about Zedd that I might be misremembering, he lost his skin after touching the Zeo crystals because he is evil and the Zeo crystals don't like that
[1:26:47] <%YakumoYomi> "Zee vs. Zedd" isn't really a thing in America.
[1:26:48] <halfmasks> zedds not dead
[1:26:50] <%Jpshum> LUL
[1:26:54] <+jiggy_snipe> PogChamp

[1:27:15] <halfmasks> A to Zed
[1:27:17] <+BaronVonFatty> guess i gotta die now NotLikeThis
[1:27:31] <%RyTYoung> And ukland
[1:27:50] <%shoutofthehobo> @woolieversus does that mean we have to turn in our American cards?
[1:27:55] <Floofiie> color > colour, but armor > armour
[1:27:56] <halfmasks> lets go boys
[1:27:57] <%ggbhtg> @woolieversus I meaaan, I'm next to Windsor, so that's fine
[1:27:58] <%YakumoYomi> I think they also use "Zed" in Japanese when pronouncing the English letter "Z".
[1:28:11] <+TheSynthHussar> Do she got a footdive tho?
[1:28:11] <pi_in_the_sci> It was assembled in LA, Zed was a name, the Canadians are confused
[1:28:27] <Rada150> I thought Zedd was old english cause the UK uses Zedd too and I think Australia does that too
[1:28:28] <%ggbhtg> Z is said like Zetto in Japan
[1:28:35] <%CaptainPileDriver> not bad for my first match right?
[1:28:50] <%Jetzord> @CaptainPileDriver not at all
[1:28:50] <+conqab> america never realizes it's the exception to the rule
[1:29:08] <%vaporousTippler> That's a weird remix of Wolverine's theme they have.
[1:29:10] <halfmasks> this game needs some lab zero level QoL improvements and itll be golden
[1:29:11] <+TheOneCalledRock> other fighting games need profiles
[1:29:14] <Rada150> just like the metric system
[1:29:33] <%ggbhtg> "U S A! U S A!" tho, murrica numbah wun
[1:30:08] <+TheOneCalledRock> ya'll are fucking quick
[1:30:12] <+TheOneCalledRock> LUL
[1:30:37] <+agoaj> W and Zedd are letternames that don't fit the rest of the alphabet.
[1:30:41] <halfmasks> eric myers + quantum ranger = vergil fanboys
[1:31:05] <%CaptainPileDriver> yosh, i'm going back to darksouls, gonna keep this on to see if any more killers are out here
[1:31:18] <anuchallengertwitch> o wow that was Akuma/Kage's stomp
[1:31:37] <halfmasks> yeah thats why i asked if theyre trying to make dai shi the akuma
[1:31:52] <bursky00> look at that team Vergil.
[1:31:56] <+TheOneCalledRock> dai shi has the demon flip
[1:31:57] <arkv01> m-m-maximum
[1:32:00] <+TheOneCalledRock> so of course LUL
[1:32:11] <%CaptainPileDriver> mezagog was a cool villain in a mask
[1:32:25] <%CaptainPileDriver> oops *mesogog
[1:32:26] <%ggbhtg> it's weird how there's no recognisable music in this game. Even with the Hasbro buyup, the rights must still be split somewhere
[1:32:26] <%DelgotHansto> Zordon just chillin in the back
[1:32:34] <%SirGO0SE> he said GET BACK in that corner
[1:32:36] <Rada150> im wondering when they run out of MVC characters to copy moves off of is that it or will they borrow moves off of other fighting games
[1:32:45] <%CaptainPileDriver> @ggbhtg probably
[1:32:52] <%vaporousTippler> Zordon watching these teens kill each other, "This is fine."
[1:32:57] <halfmasks> how does dog get his snout into that helmet
[1:33:01] <technicallyfootsies> They already nab moves from other fighting gams
[1:33:02] <Rada150> cause as i said before you could use moves from scorpion and reptile if you wanted to use phantom ranger'
[1:33:02] <%GeltonZ> @Rada150 MvC has a LOT of characters
[1:33:12] <technicallyfootsies> Zedd has tons of Gordeax stuff
[1:33:15] <+badjab326> @geltonz FACTS lol

[1:33:16] <+ZoltanBMagnus> @Rada150 They do copy moves in the mobile fighting game. Made by the same company
[1:33:22] <%jetswerve> @halfmasks He just does.
[1:33:28] <+mr_miyagichu> @Rada150 I think they borrowed gordeau normals for zedd already
[1:33:51] <Rada150> yeah i know zedd was grodeau but a predominant were from MVC
[1:34:10] <Rada150> i mean Quantum is basically cables shot
[1:34:15] <%Jack8274> You would of had that
[1:34:23] <+mr_miyagichu> that is fair
[1:34:25] <Rada150> with a sword

[1:35:19] <zakor1138> The original movie wasn't canon, tho
[1:35:25] <+ZoltanBMagnus> OG movie as well as Turbo which is an intro into the Turbo series
[1:35:30] <arkv01> but then we got the sick armor

[1:47:54] <+Hierarchic> Hierarchic subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:48:03] <Rada150> we need rito and have him play like vlad fromrising thunder with his rocket pack as a rising uppercut
[1:48:08] <Jeemukun> yeah, the Sentai lightspeed was based on didn't have a 6th ranger
[1:48:17] <Mordexai0> He has a gun that turns into an ax
[1:48:20] <halfmasks> i know goldars kinda grappler like, can we get like a pure grappler in, i wonder whod that be
[1:48:35] <Mordexai0> @jeemukun Would Demon Hunter Zeek count?
[1:48:35] <Rada150> trini dragon armor is almost pure grappler
[1:48:40] <arkv01> saban might be a piece of shit but he mainstreamed sentai into the west
[1:48:48] <%Voidwyvern> I'd say dragon armor trini fills grappler better than gfoldar
[1:48:52] <%Voidwyvern> based on her moves
[1:48:59] <halfmasks> oh my bad, i wasnt recognizing it
[1:49:01] <Rada150> if they add Wild Force Black ranger he could be a grappler thats pretty much all he did in the show
[1:49:02] <deafmelone> Blastoff! Rockin and Rollin Blastoff!
[1:49:12] <NathanTZ> Scorpina? Next Season? Noice!
