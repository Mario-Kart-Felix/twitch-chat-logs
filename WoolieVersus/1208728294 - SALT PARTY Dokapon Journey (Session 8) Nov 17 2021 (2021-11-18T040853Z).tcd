[0:03:02] <%topendbuzza> offer them a game of dokapon, that will scare them right off
[0:03:07] <andre11dr> I mean, Industrial noise is a pretty appropriate soundtrack for Dokapon

[0:08:04] <dds333a> *watch
[0:08:09] <%Solidnick18> okay
[0:08:11] <andre11dr> Good line up
[0:08:17] <%Lion_kun> I recently watched Jupiter Jazz and boy does that arc not hold up.
[0:08:18] <%ChoculaUltra> did ya go in blind or did you have some Dune knowledge going in? @MTLer
[0:08:20] <@Solidus_113> did you watch the movie too?
[0:08:21] <Arqartur0> Woolie, now I feel bad when I work on the field, as a Architect I have to be on the worksite.
[0:08:29] <TheyCallMeVawn> How dare you Reggie
[0:08:29] <%NickHatesSnow> kinda is
[0:08:35] <%MTLer> Reggie, was it overhyped cause of Rachel?
[0:08:38] <dds333a> my friend says the 3xact same thing LUL LUL
[0:08:40] <%Lion_kun> Vicious is kinda overrated as a villain.
[0:08:41] <dds333a> oh my god
[0:08:43] <+hreterdeer> Reggie: "Cowboy Bebop is mediocre"
[0:08:49] <%MTLer> @choculaultra blind. don't even think I saw the original
[0:08:51] <miucsa51> LUL
[0:08:55] <dds333a> I think it's excellent tho, all the way through
[0:09:03] <%Lion_kun> Vicious was never as cool as he was in Ballad of the Fallen Angels.
[0:09:03] <Shmario> Cowboy bepop sucks There i said it
[0:09:05] <afronooch> thats fair
[0:09:05] <+kevlarkoala> it's tough because part of the reason it's hyped so much is that it was doing something very different at the time, but it's not nearly as unique in 2021
[0:09:06] <DaKnightWarrior> Fair enough.
[0:09:06] <Arqartur0> Reggie thinks Cowboy Bebop is Trash
[0:09:18] <Tracazoid> Few things can live up to "it's the best shit" hype
[0:09:24] <TheyCallMeVawn> Reggie actually just hates Cowboy Bebop huh
[0:09:25] <dds333a> @arqartur0 LUL LUL
[0:09:27] <%sonofthedeepsouth> "Enemies to the East. Enemies to the West.Enemies to the North. Enemies to the South." Oh yeah Its Dokapon time
[0:09:28] <miucsa51> LUL
[0:09:38] <+kevlarkoala> kind of like people who didn't watch Pulp Fiction when it came out don't "get the hype" watching it for the first time now?
[0:09:41] <andre11dr> Cowboy Bebop is great, but people definitely overrate the story, my favorite episodes have nothing to do with the story
[0:09:45] <%sonofthedeepsouth> I need one of them to say I choose violence
[0:09:51] <%ChoculaUltra> did Reggie watch the Cowboy Bebop movie
[0:09:53] <%MTLer> @woolieversus tell Reggie that he better watch out for Rachel
[0:09:56] <Qsmash_> Is it over hyped if people genuinely feel that way?
[0:10:02] <dds333a> This happened to me with Texhnolyze, however, and Psycho-Pass, although I like them both (the former moreso)
[0:10:02] <SlangPunk> Bebop is my favourite animal, but boy is it not for everyone
[0:10:06] <@Solidus_113> Bebop is great because you can watch a lot of it's episodes in a vacuum and have a good experience. so many of the episodes don't interact with each other.
[0:10:11] <Arqartur0> It was hype for the time... We've taken stuff from it since then
[0:10:12] <%MajorCrasher> Reggie has to watch the live action version now lol
[0:10:12] <SlangPunk> anime*
[0:10:14] <%ChoculaUltra> BRRRRRR LUL
[0:10:14] <%Lion_kun> The plot episodes kinda suck. The best episodes were the weird random one offs like Toys in the Attic.
[0:10:15] <+whatatkins> and the BRAAAP
[0:10:16] <%Solidnick18> yep
[0:10:17] <%NickHatesSnow> LUL
[0:10:17] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[0:10:21] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Eva is unironically a meme answer
[0:10:22] <andre11dr> LUL
[0:10:23] <leith_aziz> Overhyped is not really the right word if people still watch it.
[0:10:24] <%sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[0:10:26] <Tracazoid> Construction Jazz
[0:10:27] <NeroInfinite> LUL
[0:10:27] <andre11dr> Every time
[0:10:29] <%sonofthedeepsouth> HAHHAHA
[0:10:30] <+vaderxyz1970> Only When Woolie is talking
[0:10:33] <@Menitta> Dokapon yay
[0:10:34] <%ChoculaUltra> Woolie is going to lose it
[0:10:35] <%cobalt_phoenix_> BRRRRRRRRR
[0:10:36] <+extradopeness> LUL
[0:10:36] <leith_aziz> Seems like they enjoy it. I say let em have it
[0:10:40] <%NickHatesSnow> It only happens when Woolie talks
[0:10:40] <afronooch> The workers are literally waitingfor woolie to speak LUL
[0:10:40] <+CalderGaming> netflix is outside lol
[0:10:47] <NeroInfinite> Construction Mafia at it again
[0:10:53] <user_naim> Construction Yard Shuffle
[0:10:57] <+kevlarkoala> @Qsmash_ yes, because time passes and media progresses. It wasn't overhyped 20 years ago, but it's probably pretty "overhyped" now if you're coming at it for the first time
[0:10:58] <Arqartur0> "drill the wall, Shinj"
[0:11:01] <glass_marcus> Construction is upset Reggie thinks Cowboy isn't a 10/10
[0:11:03] <%MajorCrasher> EVA has been so hyped that it could literally never live up to it for me
[0:11:05] <@Menitta> Oh no the construction is back at it
[0:11:08] <%ChoculaUltra> kinda excited the live action is getting more people to give the anime a shot
[0:11:09] <dds333a> @leith_aziz overhyped I nthe sense that they exaggerate its positives
[0:11:14] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Lets Union Mafias! We believe in you
[0:11:16] <Arqartur0> I actually never liked Evangelion
[0:11:18] <%andrewofbob> I started Ocarina of Time about 5 years ago, and I wasn't feeling that hype
[0:11:19] <SlangPunk> @lion_kun I personally don't agree but the random hijinks are definitely a selling point
[0:11:29] <@Solidus_113> it's a formative anime for a lot
[0:11:30] <+kevlarkoala> @MajorCrasher i dunno, i came to Eva after decades of hype last year and LOVED it
[0:11:32] <andre11dr> YOU HAVEN'T SEEN DEATH NOT?
[0:11:34] <+HumanDoctor> Hello Reggie and friends
[0:11:38] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Huh you never seem death note Kappa
[0:11:53] <miucsa51> this is what happened to me with the original hellsing anime the ovas ruined for me
[0:11:54] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I mean Cowboy Bebop is great, but rewatching it, there's like 20-30 percent of it that isn't all that great
[0:11:58] <leith_aziz> @dds333a To you probably, but some positives shine more to some people and some negative stink less for some. I can relate to this to some extent
[0:11:59] <DaKnightWarrior> LUL
[0:12:07] <%Lion_kun> Arkham Asylum
[0:12:08] <%mr_sups> Arkham Asylum
[0:12:12] <%sonofthedeepsouth> What do you mean you never watched FMA Brotherhood!
[0:12:12] <@Solidus_113> Arkham Asylum
[0:12:12] <+Jiggisnipe> Arkham
[0:12:14] <fruit_pie_the_magician> it almost feels like it has like three or four straight filler episodes
[0:12:18] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Arkham Asylum
[0:12:18] <NeroInfinite> Arkham Asylum
[0:12:18] <@Solidus_113> the greatest metroidvania
[0:12:19] <Zebroneath> It was Batman Arkham
[0:12:20] <%TitaniumDragoonNeo> Yeah, Arkham
[0:12:22] <leith_aziz> Arkham Asylum
[0:12:23] <%mr_sups> Liam made the Death Note comparison
[0:12:29] <dds333a> I think his deal was that you said you did, and he forgot LUL
[0:12:30] <%chiron_txn> @majorcrasher I was told to watch it because it‚Äôs important, and that was a good way to come at it.
[0:12:30] <Arqartur0> "What do you mean you never seen NARUTO!?" Two episodes and that is all I needed to not like it
[0:12:32] <%MajorCrasher> @kevlarkoala I'm glad you liked it, but I feel like I'd hate it based on the minor spoilers I know
[0:12:32] <Estuko> LUL
[0:12:40] <leith_aziz> Oh, I love Arkham, but I can tell you Asylum has aged
[0:12:40] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[0:12:44] <Sonicdy> LUL
[0:12:47] <miucsa51> LUL LUL LUL
[0:12:52] <DaKnightWarrior> God bless liam LUL
[0:12:58] <NeroInfinite> Asylum's aged like cheese as we saw from the LP. LUL
[0:13:03] <+hreterdeer> Batman is so 2000's
[0:13:04] <Treasure_Vault> liam is king of our heart
[0:13:04] <andre11dr> Clip this and send it straight to Pat
[0:13:07] <Arqartur0> Now, Serial Experiments Lain, Tho...
[0:13:11] <+kevlarkoala> @MajorCrasher all i'll say is that if you do watch it, commit to watching the series and the End of Eva movie
[0:13:19] <dds333a> @leith_aziz oh I absolutely agree, but I'm not talking the subjectivity of media, I'm talking about what overhyped means
[0:13:26] <%sonofthedeepsouth> "What you mean you didn't like Dragon Ball Duper?!" I hate it
[0:13:29] <@Menitta> this is why I dont push hard on recommendations anymore
[0:13:29] <miucsa51> @arqartur0 too bad the writer went crazy
[0:13:30] <dds333a> *about
[0:13:31] <%sonofthedeepsouth> I fucking hate it
[0:13:37] <Tracazoid> "Yeah it's pretty good, you should give it a try" Me recommending something
[0:13:38] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:13:39] <Qsmash_> @Qsmash_ So, are you saying that the quality goes down over time or the way people felt about it are no longer valid after a certain period of time?
[0:13:41] <afronooch> Say the line Woolie
[0:13:44] <Arqartur0> @miucsa51 I know, it is sad.
[0:13:59] <%MajorCrasher> you should check out Gintama if you like comedy
[0:14:00] <dds333a> Also Asylum is still excellent, but City is the best bar none,
[0:14:04] <andre11dr> But Woolie, i can't read
[0:14:05] <@Solidus_113> I ran into that problem when I was reading part 7 of JoJo. Everyone was over hyping True Man's World, so when I got there I was let down a bit by the hype
[0:14:07] <%sonofthedeepsouth> I wont read because its not finishing!
[0:14:11] <%Lion_kun> Sasaki Kojiro>>>>>Miyamoto Musashi
[0:14:14] <miucsa51> @arqartur0 Have you seen that digimon 3 play that was oooof
[0:14:16] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Vagabond NotLikeThis
[0:14:17] <%Lion_kun> Fight me nerds.
[0:14:27] <Qsmash_> I tried watching Gurren again and felt embarrassed
[0:14:30] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Berserk NotLikeThis
[0:14:35] <SlangPunk> Yeah this is all so true, I couldn't get past 5 episodes of Kill la Kill
[0:14:35] <%sonofthedeepsouth> FUCK
[0:14:37] <%papa_doomy> Painapon
[0:14:37] <dds333a> I personally never push, I hate ut
[0:14:40] <Arqartur0> @miucsa51 I haven't, need to see it now...
[0:14:45] <zechariah1799> Musashi was a coward with an oar
[0:14:57] <leith_aziz> My approach is, if I enjoy something or dont enjoy it, I'm not gonna shit on it, but instead state its not for me. Because there's some shit I love and want others to experience, but that can backfire. Some people might dislike it and make you feel like shit because you enjoyed it, but now you pushed shat to respond with "lul"
[0:14:59] <nintega010> I will definitely say One Piece is the greatest, but care if no else reads it. cause its greatness is cemented
[0:15:05] <leith_aziz> That feeling really sucks
[0:15:10] <Estuko> @Solidus_113 same for me, the moment was cool but there were plenty of other moments that triumphed over it in term of hype for me so I kinda slowed down after that since I was given the impression that True man's world was the peak of PArt 7

[0:17:07] <%sonofthedeepsouth> F U WOOLIE
[0:17:08] <quesokano> nah idk abou that
[0:17:09] <tassowo> 2049 is good but every scene with Harrison Ford sucks

[0:17:37] <%MajorCrasher> LUL
[0:17:38] <@Menitta> The original is cool for sure but 2049 has a much more approachable and compelling story and pacing

[0:18:34] <@Solidus_113> Sports anime is wild
[0:18:35] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @dashxero SeemsGood
[0:18:38] <tassowo> Theres a guy in prince of tennis that only has 2 strands on his racket
[0:18:38] <dds333a> It's metaphorical LUL
[0:18:49] <+CalderGaming> didn't someone have a serve that poisons the opponent
[0:18:49] <Arqartur0> Why make TENNIS hype!? XD
[0:18:51] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Watch Tsubasa instead Kappa
[0:18:55] <nintega010> prince of tennis is great
[0:18:57] <leith_aziz> @andre11dr I dont find enjoyment in trolling people. If I was an ass, I'd probably go "what the f*ck's wrong with you?"
[0:18:59] <%BallerSwagBro9k> OK now I'm motivated
[0:19:01] <+Suneater_Jerome> Nero Chaos picked up tennis
[0:19:12] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Makes Hajime no Ippo's screeching tires and car crash noises look tame
[0:19:24] <ittalulu> anyway, watch haikyuu

[0:19:59] <OverlordedK> I knew people in high school who were obsessed with prince of tennis
[0:20:00] <%BallerSwagBro9k> The Chinese WutFace
[0:20:05] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Prince of Tennis interpretive dance
[0:20:06] <Arqartur0> so Prince of Tennis is the Dune of Japan.

[0:21:50] <+Jiggisnipe> Woolie doesn't understand, sports is the only place it works
[0:21:51] <%tank7013> They ARE changing the world... through sports
[0:21:52] <Tracazoid> But what if they're actually the Yamcha of their universes and the real heroes are actually saving the world?
[0:21:53] <Arqartur0> Dyson Tennis Ball

[0:22:15] <andre11dr> Maybe it's like Yakuza 7 and the protag is just a crazy LUL
[0:22:20] <+Jiggisnipe> ^
[0:22:27] <quesokano> there's a poker ark in kakegurui
[0:22:29] <%DashXero> But then they'd have to oppose society.
[0:22:33] <dds333a> which one?
[0:22:37] <%andrewofbob> I've seen sports fans, all of life is in service to sport
[0:22:37] <Sonicdy> You mean CAPTAIN TSUBASA isn‚Äôt REAL???
[0:22:38] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Societta
[0:22:44] <SlangPunk> Minh needs to get on the kite shows next, he might have a better reaction from it LUL
[0:22:45] <%Lion_kun> The office had its moments in those last 2 seasons.
[0:22:47] <%DashXero> You can't change the world without opposing society.
[0:22:48] <Arqartur0> The Office is just good for the memes
[0:22:49] <andre11dr> Like most Americans shows
[0:22:53] <dds333a> okay, American officw LUL LUL
[0:22:53] <%Lion_kun> British one sucks.
[0:22:58] <quesokano> it does not
[0:23:01] <NeroInfinite> The british one was boring.
[0:23:05] <%baka_sugoi> friends is ASS
[0:23:05] <glass_marcus> The fact that it used to be british makes it MORE american
[0:23:07] <FlowLethal> how were tennis player using genjustu in prince of tennis
[0:23:08] <%andrewofbob> As a brit, I prefer american Office
[0:23:10] <dds333a> LUL LUL
[0:23:12] <Estuko> LUL How you guys read for HOW I MET YOUR DAD
[0:23:13] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Laugg tracks deserve the CHAIR
[0:23:13] <@Menitta> Idk how people can have such strong opinions on British vs American office
[0:23:16] <+retro_godfather> fresh prince still the goat
[0:23:18] <oda_flobunaga> Hogan's Heroes?
[0:23:18] <quesokano> himym is better the more you watch
[0:23:20] <@Menitta> they both are cringe as fucj
[0:23:21] <SlangPunk> Ricky Gervais is such a twat that I never bothered with uk office
[0:23:22] <BlackMage66652> PARKS AND REC
[0:23:27] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Seinfeld takes itself not seriously enough that it's usually still funny
[0:23:28] <%Lion_kun> Malcolm in the Middle was the shit.
[0:23:33] <+NahmenJayden> what about Seinfeld?
[0:23:37] <Arqartur0> Golden Girls was a better show
[0:23:37] <jacob2pop> Dokapon streams are like watching your parents fight
[0:23:40] <%SveriSageAdvice> i was one of the people who watched and caught up with all the episodes of How I Met Your Mother, only for that shitty ending to the series to happen
[0:23:40] <%MajorCrasher> all sitcoms with laugh tracks can go die imo
[0:23:42] <oda_flobunaga> more like Parks and Drek
[0:23:45] <%baka_sugoi> chris pratt
[0:23:46] <@Menitta> HIMYM is one of the worst shows I actually finished.
[0:23:54] <dds333a> everybody yeah LUL
[0:23:55] <%Lion_kun> What about Seinfeld and Frasier?
[0:23:55] <leith_aziz> Well, Big Bang Theory I wont comment on, because I've never watched but I know there's enough people that enjoy it, so I dont think its bad. its more likely not for me
[0:23:56] <%mighty_max_t> always sunny seems to just scurt by
[0:23:59] <%sonofthedeepsouth> REAL
[0:24:11] <%sonofthedeepsouth> KILL THE SIMPSONS
[0:24:12] <andre11dr> American shows have a real problem with have a GOOD ENDING
[0:24:12] <dds333a> Also, those first two seasons of parks and rec are a bit awkward
[0:24:13] <%MTLer> Seinfeld is the goat
[0:24:16] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Seinfeld was the only good Sitcom ever.
[0:24:19] <@Solidus_113> Seinfeld is literally a show about nothing
[0:24:21] <%tank7013> I think Plague put it pretty well when he basically called Big Bang Theory nerdface comedy
[0:24:26] <%DashXero> Seinfeld had a fitting ending.
[0:24:29] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Frasier is kind of funny, but it kind of focuses too much on like....a rich piece of shit
[0:24:30] <+captainpodock> schitts creek is the only exception
[0:24:34] <zechariah1799> So it‚Äôs like long running anime
[0:24:34] <Arqartur0> This is why the last season of Game of Thrones was... That
[0:24:36] <oda_flobunaga> Blackadder is a sitcom though...
[0:24:46] <%SveriSageAdvice> Big Bang Theory i immediately threw in the trash when they tried to pretend to know what Halo Reach was about, talking about blowing up the Pillar of Autumn
[0:24:47] <NeroInfinite> Seinfield is basically always sunny pre always sunny.
[0:24:48] <@Menitta> howd The Good Place end? was that good?
[0:24:58] <andre11dr> Can we just take a moment and appreciate that TSG had a great ending?
[0:25:00] <glass_marcus> good place finished solid
[0:25:02] <%Lion_kun> Friends is ok
[0:25:03] <Treasure_Vault> we can't predict the economic impact of ending the simpsons
[0:25:06] <%DashXero> @Menitta It was really good.
[0:25:11] <+CrabStealer> Good place had a really solid ending
[0:25:13] <%andrewofbob> Simpsons just aims for modern commentary these days
[0:25:14] <@Menitta> That's good to hear
[0:25:17] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Fucking simpsons hasn't been good since like 1998
[0:25:18] <+Jiggisnipe> Th Simpsons ending crashes the economy
[0:25:20] <@Menitta> I need to finish that
[0:25:23] <%Lion_kun> UK office Michael was an asshole who ruined the show.
[0:25:31] <leith_aziz> I feel like this is probably an audience thing. There's deff enough people taht love this sorta shit when we dont. That's usually called preference. That's my understanding pickyShrug
[0:25:31] <@Solidus_113> Did you see Downton Abby Shippuden
[0:25:33] <%Lion_kun> US Michael had heart.
[0:25:34] <@Menitta> Watch Black Books
[0:25:35] <+jordy_j_s> Netflix originals are pretty good about that
[0:25:42] <andre11dr> Shonen manga also has this problem
[0:25:43] <@Menitta> Black Books is fantastic.
[0:25:45] <leith_aziz> But yeah, when the ending sucks, that shit always feels bad
[0:25:45] <%Lion_kun> Red Dwarf is great.
[0:25:47] <oda_flobunaga> Trailer Park Boys though?
[0:25:48] <+Suneater_Jerome> how did yall find trailer park boys?
[0:25:52] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Fawlty Towers was a British Sitcom that was only like 8 episodes and its considered one of the greatest Sitcoms ever
[0:25:59] <%sonofthedeepsouth> But Woolie I want my large fries with cheddar and bacon tho. Even tho the small one will be better for me
[0:26:02] <%baka_sugoi> letterkenny
[0:26:03] <BlackMage66652> Bible Black was a great sitcom
[0:26:03] <%BallerSwagBro9k> go watch it
[0:26:05] <%topendbuzza> and here we go...
[0:26:09] <+NahmenJayden> damn you beat me to the Fawlty Towers mention
[0:26:09] <Arqartur0> I watched Trese; I liked it, but, it felt like it needed an extra oomph
[0:26:15] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @blackmage66652 fair
[0:26:17] <fruit_pie_the_magician> If anything it just makes everything funnier
[0:26:19] <dds333a> BACK TO YOU
[0:26:19] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Bible Black was the greatest sitcom of all time
[0:26:20] <%Lion_kun> Red Dwarf is like the only long running British comedy and does not suck.
[0:26:44] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Remember when the teacher helped her student in the nursery
[0:26:44] <andre11dr> I can't believe Woolie has zero plushie
[0:26:46] <%NezuVT> BCV part 2: Kongo returns
[0:26:50] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Yeah u do
[0:27:04] <oda_flobunaga> Doctor Who is a pretty good comedy, I mean you can't help but to laugh at it at this point.
[0:27:15] <rcand9> Seinfeld got in and out and the quality didnt dip
[0:27:26] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Mezzo Forte was a good action series Kappa
[0:27:32] <@Menitta> I cant stand Dr. Who but it's for partly petty reasons
[0:27:33] <%MajorCrasher> all my favorite comedies are Japanese at this point
[0:27:34] <leith_aziz> Anyway, it's interesting seeing an audience like your and your perspective. Im kind of a zoomer, so my attitude is less "this shit bothers me" and more "this shit's not for me personally". Mix of culture thing

[0:37:49] <+Jiggisnipe> Ice for Reggie would have done 4k to both of them
[0:37:52] <+DovaDude29> Reggie: how could this happen to me?, I made a mistake, got nowhere to run....
[0:37:57] <WeiLiHeng> did Minh get the tiara?

[0:39:34] <just_matt_ds> ICE HIM
[0:39:34] <%cobalt_phoenix_> can't move if you're dead
[0:39:35] <+Jiggisnipe> Reggie would have annihilated them with it, it was like 4k for both of them
[0:39:36] <SethKyu> Just ice? Not Ice+ or anything?
[0:39:36] <just_matt_ds> GLASS HIM
[0:39:43] <haisho> ah the best mobility spell. Death.

[0:42:56] <+NahmenJayden> Woolie is still shook
[0:42:59] <andre11dr> Watch the monster reset everyone's town ,just for good measure
[0:42:59] <dds333a> needed to get shutdown LUL
[0:43:13] <dds333a> god laughs at plans LUL
[0:43:18] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Thats was ur mistakes
[0:43:22] <%X2Eliah> LUL
[0:43:31] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Dokapon Planning LUL
[0:43:36] <OldManDeckardCain> not your life, woolie? LUL
[0:43:37] <%livlinn> !uptime
[0:43:37] <@Moobot> @livlinn WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 52 minutes and 28 seconds
[0:43:46] <%topendbuzza> buy one
[0:43:48] <+Jiggisnipe> Reggie should buy magic and wait for Minh to get through the forest then gather back lol
[0:43:49] <%livlinn> no keikaku in Dokapon
[0:43:53] <%MajorCrasher> I don't think anyone even has towns right now. they got reset 2-3 times last session
[0:43:55] <%X2Eliah> Now is a good time for Woolie to just go pick up all the cities
[0:43:59] <%DashXero> If Minh sold his sky ring, what would happen if he were gathered underwater?
[0:44:04] <ilpeggiore_> is this a ds game?
[0:44:10] <%MajorCrasher> did they miss Minh buying telewarp? LUL
[0:44:18] <dds333a> @ilpeggiore_ yep
[0:44:29] <Leonheart777> @DashXero Gather only works if they are in the same plane
[0:44:29] <%emMmDeeKay> WHAT DID I MISS? how did woolie went from Darkling Candidate to 1st place in 15 minutes
[0:44:35] <dds333a> @dashxero I was thinking that last session
[0:44:38] <%DashXero> @Leonheart777 Ah.
[0:44:43] <JetpackMcQuack> dokapon has plans too
[0:44:44] <%MajorCrasher> @dashxero we don't know, but if it works like kingdom, it's minor damage over time
[0:44:47] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Yes.
[0:45:06] <dds333a> I was wondering if it's like kingdom where it's damage each turn
[0:45:11] <andre11dr> Dose gather even work underwater?
[0:45:24] <%MajorCrasher> idk

[1:00:30] <%Solidnick18> idk
[1:00:40] <dds333a> it makes Jolyne's conviction behind the name of her Stand hilarious LUL
[1:00:49] <+Jiggisnipe> who ever is doing the main quest is setting the pace
[1:00:56] <andre11dr> Wait i actually don't know, what did they call Stone Free?

[1:02:01] <+DovaDude29> Part 5‚Äôs was at least in Italian I think.

[1:02:13] <dds333a> @titaniumdragoonneo yea, but Giorno doesn't name his own Stand in the Part LUL
[1:02:32] <andre11dr> Man what the fuck are they gonna do when they get to the Mairlin Manson stand ? LUL
[1:02:40] <dds333a> The reason why it's called Stone Free is an intentional choice with the name of the Part LUL
[1:03:03] <dds333a> @dovadude29 nah, the language has nothing to do with it
[1:03:03] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1460530098050945027?s=20

[3:40:14] <%Solidnick18> fair enough
[3:40:14] <C4m3r0n0409> Nice move Woolie
[3:40:20] <dds333a> LUL LUL LUL SeemsGood
[3:40:31] <andre11dr> I thought that was kinda dumb
[3:40:35] <%topendbuzza> you can go back
[3:40:37] <%X2Eliah> ofc
[3:40:41] <+Jiggisnipe> yea of course lol
[3:40:45] <andre11dr> Minh should've stood his ground
[3:40:47] <%cobalt_phoenix_> reggie
[3:40:49] <+pectusumbra> Is it random? I thought the greens were set
[3:40:51] <+Jiggisnipe> Reggie plz LUL
[3:40:53] <KaitlynnHere> Are they passing around one controller?
[3:40:59] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @andre11dr i agree
[3:41:09] <+undersea_magic> one ds
[3:41:15] <C4m3r0n0409> WOW
[3:41:18] <dds333a> LUL LUL
[3:41:20] <+Grayhammatter> fucking jesus
[3:41:22] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[3:41:22] <%X2Eliah> System = Don't Mash
[3:41:25] <dds333a> go for it
[3:41:26] <andre11dr> LUL
[3:41:29] <Wahrow> Wait, is there some kind of rewind on NDS emulators? Cause they could have done that as well
[3:41:33] <+Grayhammatter> ayo, a revival
[3:41:48] <dds333a> Bobby safety net LUL
[3:42:02] <%topendbuzza> if woolz had a revival it would have been fucked
[3:42:08] <%MajorCrasher> just rewind the ds woolie Kappa
[3:42:10] <OldManDeckardCain> minh just needs to stop mashing, not only did he do this twice, he also wasted his reveal because of that
[3:42:15] <andre11dr> Someone should definitely fling Bobby away from there
[3:42:21] <dds333a> @wahrow no, the DS has no rewind feature
[3:42:22] <+HolePunchLeaf> what do you mean, they are all playing on three seperate legal DSs and 3 copies of dokapon Journey :) , they can't rewind :)
[3:42:37] <+Jiggisnipe> if this was a tourney, an intentional pause is a dq even if your're winning
[3:42:43] <+SnorlaxBud> "where's that referee"
[3:42:46] <+Jiggisnipe> unintentional*
[3:42:55] <brunoberserk> ifyou feel its unfair just reload the game
[3:43:00] <%ChoculaUltra> just don't let it happen, 5head Kappa
[3:43:03] <%Th3SmartAlec> Minh is now planning for it to happen LUL
[3:43:19] <dds333a> @brunoberserk a bit precarious maybe LUL
[3:43:33] <+machinetoys> makeup calls suck
[3:43:36] <+Grayhammatter> well now minh and woolie are in africa now
[3:43:39] <dds333a> conaidering their last save was way before
[3:43:42] <andre11dr> It was definitely unfair, he let you get a win for picking a random option instead of you
[3:44:12] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[3:44:13] <+Jiggisnipe> move lol
[3:44:17] <dds333a> Minh is generous LUL LUL
[3:44:20] <+HolePunchLeaf> outcome's not the point, the control was the issue
[3:44:23] <+paladinstarbuster> YOU CANT TRUST HIM
[3:44:29] <user_naim> dodging the fight is enough compensation for minh just flipping the coin for him
[3:44:51] <Starmanhero> He did it again?
[3:44:53] <%Solidnick18> charm
[3:44:55] <dds333a> @paladinstarbuster that wasn't me, the serum affected my mind
[3:44:56] <andre11dr> If it was like, he took a swing as your caracter i would've got it ,but he literally picked something that was random
[3:44:58] <TheNeonCaster> Oh lord, his name's Bobby now? That's SO MEAN
[3:44:58] <+pectusumbra> steal a town?
[3:44:59] <+pingu_crimson> town steal
[3:45:00] <+Jiggisnipe> steal city item I think
[3:45:00] <dds333a> LUL
[3:45:06] <%Solidnick18> reggie is charming

[3:45:33] <SethKyu> Is reggie farming? or is bobby?
[3:45:36] <dds333a> the closes you'll ever get to a girl bobby
[3:45:36] <andre11dr> Meanwhile, Reggie is reaching heaven
[3:45:48] <+Grayhammatter> minh is becoming chaos
[3:45:56] <+paladinstarbuster> he should keep doing it toll they catch up
[3:45:56] <NoviceArtist4090> Mystery addiction
[3:46:07] <%X2Eliah> Mystery could be wild
[3:46:22] <+pectusumbra> seems not as good as some dungeon stuff. I imagine you REALLY want lockpicks for the tower though
[3:46:27] <andre11dr> See ,Bobby influenced Minh to get into loot boxes
[3:46:29] <user_naim> Keep rolling those dice why not.
[3:46:33] <+pingu_crimson> 2 gem and telewarp
[3:46:41] <brunoberserk> mystery is basically a lootbox
[3:46:56] <pjbuster> who is bobby lmaooo

[3:47:59] <dds333a> @pectusumbra no, I mean like actual final boss endgame LUL
[3:48:12] <+pingu_crimson> if it's like a field warp, it's the way you entered
[3:48:16] <just_matt_ds> 2 chapters till the end
[3:48:17] <pjbuster> reggie really said, I'll put bobby kotick on blast every chance I'll get
[3:48:18] <user_naim> You‚Äôd think Bobby would be the one doing shit on other people‚Äôs behalf
[3:48:20] <just_matt_ds> 8 total
[3:48:21] <dds333a> excuse me, more accurately, final dungeon LUL
[3:48:44] <dds333a> @pjbuster you think it was reggie? Kappa

[3:54:57] <JetpackMcQuack> that cell city scene is so dope
[3:54:58] <DedlokPM> Dragon Ball x Dead By Daylight

[3:55:13] <dds333a> canonically, they would get bodied LUL
[3:55:16] <SethKyu> So wait, when reggie was pulled from the cave, was that mystery, or gather?
[3:55:17] <%Solidnick18> gun will kill perfect cell
[3:55:19] <Asuterisuku> Any chance of Rose?
[3:55:24] <FrostedZaibatsu> No Farmer with a Shotgun no buy
[3:55:24] <+terry_quest> sounds like the jojo BR
[3:55:28] <+pectusumbra> @SethKyu mystery

[3:55:39] <dds333a> @terry_quest right and that was awful
[3:55:46] <%jinking79> i mean budokai tenkaichi exists
[3:55:47] <%thesw1tch> oh right i forgot they making a jojo br
[3:55:55] <%MajorCrasher> honestly gun killing cell is no more goofy than video beating Jiren in FighterZ
[3:55:56] <Asuterisuku> I like the idea of the normal people in the DB universe.
[3:56:05] <%MajorCrasher> videl*
[3:56:06] <Shwepie> It's an anti-Cell rocket launcher, so it'll work... right?
[3:56:15] <%emMmDeeKay> So Dragon Ball Break is basically the Chimera Ant Arc from Hunter & Hunter?
[3:56:15] <JetpackMcQuack> timelines
[3:56:19] <DedlokPM> Cell, Frieza, and Buu @WoolieVersus
[3:56:25] <%Th3SmartAlec> Survive against this enemy then can blow up the whole town in 1 second
[3:56:26] <JetpackMcQuack> literally the first scene in DBZ
[3:56:32] <OldManDeckardCain> surive until goku arrives
[3:56:37] <dds333a> those three just chasing are terrifying tho
[3:56:38] <FrostedZaibatsu> Gun is a distraction
[3:56:42] <+Grayhammatter> survive until goku
[3:56:50] <%townzzzzz> maybe find the dragon balls
[3:56:53] <bear_breaker20> alt universe Dr gero infects everyone with Cell's dna so a battle royal is all the characters slowly building power like cell would defeating opponents. That Ones Free.
[3:56:53] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[3:56:55] <oda_flobunaga> Mufa-Ba though
[3:56:56] <+Pinkiefan> Just destroy his mitochondria.

[3:57:00] <pjbuster> "survive until goku" just like the show
[3:57:01] <+terry_quest> LUL
[3:57:06] <SethKyu> They should make it so you need to gather the dragon balls
[3:57:06] <%emMmDeeKay> Survive until Saitama reaches the arena

[3:57:10] <SunxAngel> Yamacha? Make your last will.
[3:57:10] <SethKyu> to wish the big bad away
[3:57:12] <%MajorCrasher> LUL
[3:57:12] <stevenellis386> and then said item would fail because goku doesn't OWN a PHONE ( or know how to use one)lol
[3:57:14] <anarchistPastry> Teen Bulma is displaced in time, current Bulma is still running around out of context somewhere else
[3:57:16] <oda_flobunaga> Mufa_Ba>literally anything

[3:58:10] <bear_breaker20> yamcha can be used as ez exp bait to lure groups

[4:01:00] <$SilverRoddo> Then Woolie will counter-make money off of that guy.
[4:01:01] <andre11dr> Like, why would buy that? Just take a fucking screenshot from the vidoe
[4:01:05] <stevenellis386> how much value is woolie worth chat?

[4:02:27] <user_naim> Also what if you just crop an image slightly differently? Do the nft platforms even check for duplicates?
[4:02:31] <+HolePunchLeaf> @bear_breaker20 hey hey now, it's not just money laundering, it's also used to sell drugs and guns too
[4:02:36] <just_matt_ds> Are we on chapter 7 now btw?
[4:02:54] <just_matt_ds> I missed the chapter intro i think
[4:03:01] <Ziegsy> @HolePunchLeaf wait, you saying I can get drugs by drawing terrible monkeys?
[4:03:04] <+HolePunchLeaf> @user_naim nft platforms don't even check if you own the image you're selling first LUL

[4:03:14] <bear_breaker20> but those are cool when i have them @HolePunchLeaf BibleThump
[4:03:36] <$SilverRoddo> I feel a Montreal mob man made that nft.
[4:03:51] <%jinking79> the N Word Pass stands for NFT
[4:03:59] <user_naim> @holepunchleaf so i‚Äôve understood
[4:04:10] <+HolePunchLeaf> @Ziegsy Sure, as long as you speak into this microphone that's totally not owned by the ATF :)
[4:04:13] <+vaderxyz1970> The Deck of Many Things?
[4:04:15] <dds333a> @silverroddo are they gonna present it when they come to collect next time? LUL
[4:04:16] <JetpackMcQuack> Mystery!
[4:04:18] <bear_breaker20> all secrets are known just recycled
[4:04:43] <+Jiggisnipe> still have to find them
[4:04:49] <%smallboops> the z fighters power creeped the dragon itself
[4:04:50] <+eanscrale> well it was supposed to end before that, but then editorial said NO
[4:04:50] <+Jiggisnipe> Bulma broke the system
[4:04:58] <dds333a> no cool motorcycles anymore
[4:04:58] <+HolePunchLeaf> Emperor Pilaf would just get wrecked by anyone in Z
[4:05:04] <bear_breaker20> kamehameha is the strongest move guys
[4:05:11] <+cgkonnor> That's Naruto too now
[4:05:12] <dds333a> But the cool shit is still there
[4:05:14] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[4:05:14] <%Solidnick18> omg
[4:05:21] <%MajorCrasher> GT had an answer to that
[4:05:22] <+paladinstarbuster> We got super dragon balls now
[4:05:23] <%smallboops> cant wait for the one piece to get funged
[4:05:26] <+vaderxyz1970> The One Piece was inside you all along
[4:05:26] <NoviceArtist4090> üóø
[4:05:28] <+Grayhammatter> that would be silly
[4:05:35] <OblivionSword1> the one piece is a joke all along
[4:05:35] <%MajorCrasher> one piece is not the dragon balls lmao
[4:05:35] <dds333a> I keep thinking that Gol's treasure is just an empty ass box LUL
[4:05:35] <%Solidnick18> I'd be heart broken
[4:05:37] <+Grayhammatter> üóø
[4:05:43] <Wahrow> The One Piece is the Woolie NFT
[4:05:44] <%NickHatesSnow> I don't even care what one piece is there'ss like 80 other mysteries
[4:05:45] <SpookyMooks> i could imagine the fan reaction
[4:05:47] <+kewlmyc> Lol just got here. Whoever did that to Reggie's name is sick
[4:05:50] <+pingu_crimson> into the cave i guess
[4:06:00] <+pectusumbra> Oda HAS confirmed the One Piece is not friendship or some bullshit. It's an actual thing
[4:06:02] <+HolePunchLeaf> The one piece is worth infinite money but by the time you get to it you're too notorious to sell it
[4:06:03] <andre11dr> Didn't Oda confirm that the One Piece is an actual real thing?
[4:06:10] <dds333a> @nickhatessnow some of which which might never get answers
[4:06:21] <Ziegsy> Isnt one piece a bathing suit?
[4:06:23] <andre11dr> Not friendship or some bullshit like that
[4:06:23] <pjbuster> yea, the One piece is a tangible thing
[4:06:26] <%smallboops> i thought the one piece was supposed to be a big gun that blew up a moutnain that united the world into "one piece"
[4:06:28] <DaKnightWarrior> That would be the best One Piece ending LUL
[4:06:30] <+pingu_crimson> The One Piece is an actual thing, Woolz
[4:06:43] <JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[4:06:43] <dds333a> yeah
[4:06:45] <%Th3SmartAlec> Is it?! LUL
[4:06:47] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[4:06:49] <dds333a> LUL LUL
[4:06:56] <%xcompleasedad> @andre11dr Yes, but for all we know, it got shrunk to the size of a pea by the true treasure: the Shrink Fruit, which gives you Ant-Man powers.
[4:07:00] <FrostedZaibatsu> Its not a spoiler
[4:07:00] <%MajorCrasher> @smallboops no lmao
[4:07:03] <bear_breaker20> its fucked to me that theres so much one piece and still Luffy's motivation for becoming pirate king is still vague
[4:07:07] <+eanscrale> God Toriyama, is that all you have left?
[4:07:10] <%smallboops> fr hit is cool
[4:07:11] <%Deft_Thought> Hit's a jobber and it sucks
[4:07:12] <%NickHatesSnow> @dds333a yeup and I'm okay with that. Although it seems like Oda is answering a bunnch recently with Wano
[4:07:14] <JetpackMcQuack> dragon ball might be fucking nonsense
[4:07:24] <%X2Eliah> The ultimate moon-sized dragn balls are made from dragon cheese
[4:07:26] <+Jiggisnipe> probably not
[4:07:32] <bear_breaker20> @smallboops @Deft_Thought ha now you two have to date
[4:07:37] <andre11dr> @eanscrale Toriama is not even writing all of it
[4:07:38] <%Tearonex> you can't
[4:07:39] <%MajorCrasher> @bear_breaker20 have you read/watched it? it's pretty clear
[4:07:40] <+paladinstarbuster> no because shenron is not that strong
[4:07:42] <%Solidnick18> Nobody is stronger broly
[4:07:45] <+pingu_crimson> laughs in Super manga
[4:07:46] <%smallboops> damn it
[4:07:46] <%Solidnick18> then*
[4:07:50] <FrostedZaibatsu> The big dragon balls have no limit on the wish
[4:07:53] <%NickHatesSnow> shenron is as strong as piccolo
[4:07:55] <+eanscrale> @andre11dr Then what's the damn pint anymore?!?!?
[4:07:57] <BlackermanZX> iirc luffy want to be the king because its the person with the most freedom
[4:07:58] <dds333a> @solidus_113 his power is maximum
[4:07:58] <+Grayhammatter> dragon, dragon, rock the dragon
[4:08:02] <+HolePunchLeaf> You just need to wish for the strongest Z warrior, Yajirobe
[4:08:03] <pjbuster> You can't make wishes stronger than the namek who made the dragon balls (whatever that means)
[4:08:04] <Ziegsy> can you chain summon dragons until you get one strong enough then? 'I wish fr a stronger dragon'
[4:08:05] <SpookyMooks> Dragon deez balls
[4:08:06] <%Solidnick18> red chest
[4:08:12] <%Deft_Thought> @bear_breaker20 wooliePOYO
[4:08:18] <andre11dr> Toyetaro is a assistant writer to keep Toriamas bullshit in check
[4:08:23] <%smallboops> what if you used a wish to summon the balls of a better dragon
[4:08:24] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:08:28] <bear_breaker20> @MajorCrasher from what I know he wants to be just like the last pirate king, but the actual i guess goals he has arent really explained ?
[4:08:55] <%cubbywolf> LUL named bobby kotik omg
[4:08:58] <pjbuster> I hope the one piece is a generic pirate hat.
[4:09:00] <%cubbywolf> can't cheer for 2nd now
[4:09:08] <%cubbywolf> what a fuck
[4:09:17] <%MajorCrasher> the goal is to become pirate king because it's a fun adventure, and the goal is to literally find the unfindable treasure that is one piece
[4:09:19] <+terry_quest> what if its an actual  one piece
[4:09:21] <bear_breaker20> like they did a flashback arc but still had it be obfuscated @MajorCrasher
[4:09:32] <bear_breaker20> to when he was a kid*
[4:09:44] <dds333a> another pull
[4:09:45] <+HolePunchLeaf> It's funny bc i think it's clear from GT that Toriyama wanted for a long time to get back to the silliness of OG Dragonball and Dr Slump, but the pull of Z is far too great so I guess he's just coming up with more villains forver now I guess
[4:09:47] <%cubbywolf> eh
[4:09:50] <+Grayhammatter> another pull
[4:10:00] <dds333a> LUL LUL
[4:10:01] <+eanscrale> STONKS for Activision Blizzard
[4:10:02] <glass_marcus> Commie box
[4:10:03] <%cubbywolf> 50/50
[4:10:06] <andre11dr> It's not like Toriama had DBZ planed out ,he wanted Dr Gerob to be the main villain but then the editor said, "that's stupid, change it"
[4:10:12] <+pingu_crimson> The only thing canon-wise we actually have about the One Piece is Roger and his crew's reaction.
[4:10:13] <JetpackMcQuack> Apocalypse!
[4:10:16] <%strakillias> That would be rad
[4:10:20] <%cubbywolf> left
[4:10:25] <+vaderxyz1970> Everyone is now Lv 1
[4:10:34] <%smallboops> to be fair most manga arent planned out long term
[4:10:38] <+Grayhammatter> that would be rad, then woolie would have to get another warmaul
[4:10:40] <bear_breaker20> @MajorCrasher so he's just pulling a NeverEndingStory ? lol didnt thats fair
[4:10:45] <%cubbywolf> yeye
[4:10:49] <bear_breaker20> that is fair*
[4:10:53] <%smallboops> sometimes you get picked up and go "oh shit time to keep this going forever so i can eat"
[4:11:02] <%cubbywolf> woolie thats not long enough to wash your hands... so at least you didnt pee on your hands
[4:11:03] <+vaderxyz1970> Mystery 0.0001% chance deletes save
[4:11:08] <+pingu_crimson> The only thing canon-wise we actually have about the One Piece is Roger and his crew's reaction to finding it.
[4:11:10] <%Rafraud> Everyone always forgets Minh's colorblind nerf
[4:11:15] <dds333a> @smallboops exactly
[4:11:18] <%cubbywolf> bobby kotik would be 1st
[4:11:28] <Wahrow> I'd love to see how Minh sees the world
[4:11:30] <%MajorCrasher> no, the story is more than half over. it's winding down in the next few years because he nearly has all the pieces needed to find one piece @bear_breaker20
[4:11:33] <user_naim> at some point I need to read about how araki wrote jojo.
[4:11:34] <%cubbywolf> like a praying mantis maybe
[4:11:42] <%cubbywolf> or a butterfly
[4:11:43] <dds333a> Araki went through two serialzations before jojo
[4:11:43] <andre11dr> While HxH is great, i definitely get the feeling that it has no long term planning
[4:11:48] <+HolePunchLeaf> The final chapter of One Piece will just be "Hey, you found One Piece (of Eight)" :)
[4:12:07] <andre11dr> It's basically becomes like 3 different animes
[4:12:47] <+pingu_crimson> wait how big is the loop on the last continent?
[4:12:49] <dds333a> Not to mention that the only plan Araki had in mind was that he planned for the first three Parts, and the general overview mind you, not the nitty gritty
[4:13:17] <%smallboops> i wish grocers had music this chill
[4:13:25] <%cubbywolf> prank
[4:13:35] <dds333a> @cubbywolf LUL LUL
[4:13:50] <bear_breaker20> its just crazy to me that this whole time you could replace luffy with say goku and besides the character relations theyd be the same mostly
[4:14:21] <%cubbywolf> flat character arch, the story changes around them they stay the same
[4:14:23] <BlackermanZX> to think HxH has been on hiatus for like 2 years traight
[4:14:24] <Afrosamasenpai> IT'S MY TOWN! IT'S MY TOWN!
[4:14:27] <+HolePunchLeaf> @dds333a yeah, but otoh how psychotic would you have to be to plan out a 20 year run in advance before you even sold your first story
[4:14:32] <%smallboops> LUL
[4:14:39] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[4:14:40] <%MajorCrasher> they are very different characters personality wise. the only thing they have in common is liking to fight and liking eating a lot

[4:14:43] <dds333a> @holepunchleaf right LUL
[4:14:46] <+pectusumbra> damn that's rough

[4:15:03] <+eanscrale> Can't have that now can we
[4:15:10] <andre11dr> Bobby Shmovement
[4:15:12] <dds333a> @topendbuzza who the fuck is Reggie Kappa
[4:15:12] <bear_breaker20> actually havingna ending planned and thenm going for two fucking decades is nuts
[4:15:13] <%Solidnick18> yeah maybe
[4:15:13] <brunoberserk> i love that cross tekken buttrock opening
[4:15:18] <%MajorCrasher> Luffy has so much character growth in the last 2 arcs
[4:15:29] <%Solidnick18> i mean after what he admitted...
[4:15:29] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:15:31] <+vaderxyz1970> So Kojima was right with POLIECENAUTS
[4:15:34] <%Solidnick18> he might
[4:15:52] <+HolePunchLeaf> @bear_breaker20 I just want him to do more with Jorge Joestar
[4:15:57] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[4:16:10] <dds333a> He accepted it

[4:16:23] <bear_breaker20> oh sorry i thought you were talking about one piece @HolePunchLeaf
[4:16:26] <%cubbywolf> YEYEYE
[4:16:26] <DaKnightWarrior> The one piece is bobby kotick NotLikeThis
[4:16:27] <%smallboops> kojima has been both right and wrong about the future in equal proportions. which is still too accurate
[4:16:28] <BlackermanZX> reggie should change Minhs name to Randy Bitchford
[4:16:29] <%cubbywolf> dark souled
[4:16:29] <dds333a> @holepunchleaf well, Araki didn't right that LUL
[4:16:41] <andre11dr> At least he gets a town out of it

[4:20:57] <dds333a> not that I'm complaining LUL
[4:21:08] <OblivionSword1> might be an enemy drop

[4:21:23] <andre11dr> @dds333a Getting to the middle is so hard ,Minh got lucky as hell he got to rest there
[4:21:30] <dds333a> @pectusumbra because they have to kill the boss

[4:49:33] <dds333a> STRIKE NO, Don't, but STRIKE
[4:49:38] <+tomdwarf> i assume auto counter at all times, its just never worth it. wasting a turn on the magic guard is better.
[4:49:38] <%smallboops> in dokapon kingdom (wii) the calc was  For Attack -> Defend: Baseline Damage = (A.AT * 2.8) - (D.DF * 1.2)
[4:49:39] <+Jiggisnipe> strike or echo could kill
[4:49:47] <+Grayhammatter> nothing will one-shot it
[4:49:48] <+pingu_crimson> yeah go for glare
[4:49:49] <Arqartur0> Attack, do it!
[4:49:53] <pjbuster> echo is the best bet

[4:50:34] <%Th3SmartAlec> the fact you refuse to strike means the mental damage is already done

[4:51:10] <Arqartur0> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[4:51:10] <+pectusumbra> true, could just give up
[4:51:10] <%MajorCrasher> LUL
[4:51:11] <%debrv> DO YOU THINK THAT HE WOULD CAST IT?
[4:51:12] <pjbuster> counte
[4:51:15] <SethKyu> give up?
[4:51:15] <bevyrage> renew reduces damage and heals though, just use that
[4:51:16] <%fetrigon> dodge les go
[4:51:20] <+wynnewake> 500 AT aint gonna play
[4:51:23] <ireliaismaiwaifu> counter :^)
[4:51:25] <+Jiggisnipe> I think balefire and strike kill if not blocked
[4:51:25] <Asuterisuku> You have initiative; Renew should happen first right?
[4:51:26] <dds333a> LUL LUL
[4:51:27] <Leonavius> you're not surviving an attack
[4:51:28] <Leonavius> renew
[4:51:35] <andre11dr> Counter :)
[4:51:36] <SethKyu> would bale kill him?
[4:51:38] <+pingu_crimson> you have speed, go for the renew he can't miss on magic
[4:51:39] <%smallboops> atk into counter would be  dokapon kingdom (wii) For Attack -> Counter Baseline Damage = ((A.AT * 2.8) - (D.DF * 1.2)) * 1.8
[4:51:39] <%debrv> THAT'S THE QUESTION. YOU CAN PLAY RISKY, YOU CAN DO THIS.
[4:51:41] <SethKyu> how much the first do?
[4:51:41] <Arqartur0> Renew!!
[4:51:43] <JetpackMcQuack> maybe it will be ok
[4:51:48] <+pectusumbra> no he's got a gather but that brings reggie
[4:51:54] <andre11dr> Just counter you dumb dumb :)
[4:52:01] <dds333a> @sethkyu it will he has to guess right
[4:52:05] <+Jiggisnipe> Reggie also can gather cuz he's on the shop now
[4:52:09] <Leonavius> renew for sure
[4:52:10] <stevenellis386> defend so you can survive another turn.
[4:52:10] <+xerotwo> BOOBA
[4:52:11] <+pingu_crimson> renew
[4:52:14] <+Shady_Zaku> doodScrub

[4:52:25] <%debrv> Deeeeefeeeeend.
[4:52:26] <+wynnewake> impossible to make a correct decision here
[4:52:27] <%strakillias> Counter is the only way to win on this turn. do that
[4:52:31] <Zineta> Taking "notes"
[4:52:34] <%MajorCrasher> LUL
[4:52:37] <andre11dr> But honestly i would renew here ,I'm feeling the magic
[4:52:38] <Asuterisuku> OF course Bobby Kotick says it's boobs.
[4:52:39] <+Jiggisnipe> Can Reggie kill the monster with field magic?
[4:52:42] <%fetrigon> Reggie with the hard read LUL
[4:52:44] <+pectusumbra> renew because I bet he's gonna breath fire again
[4:52:46] <%Th3SmartAlec> so... renew
[4:52:48] <+pingu_crimson> renew, stay in the fight
[4:52:54] <Arqartur0> Renew!
[4:52:57] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> even if your equipment breaks you could still finish it off though
[4:52:58] <ireliaismaiwaifu> woolie doesnt believe in the counter

[4:53:55] <+wynnewake> i think woolie is right
[4:54:01] <SethKyu> But if you give up, can he get back to this spot?

[4:54:25] <+Shady_Zaku> 8 HEALTH
[4:54:27] <pjbuster> I believed in him
[4:54:28] <Leonavius> yeah you had to renew
[4:54:29] <dds333a> @pjbuster I agree
[4:54:30] <+pectusumbra> it's a very dicey situation
[4:54:32] <Arqartur0> WutFace
[4:54:32] <+mechslayer71> wait I've been gone a bit, what the fuck did Reggie do to his name monkaS
[4:54:39] <nintega010> reggie kill it with magic
[4:54:40] <C4m3r0n0409> Why would you do that
[4:54:41] <andre11dr> Now Minh has to hurry his ass up there
[4:54:43] <FrostedZaibatsu> @pjbuster he already lost in his mind
[4:54:43] <+pingu_crimson> gather now, fuck minh
[4:54:47] <+pectusumbra> @mechslayer71 minh killed him
[4:54:49] <dds333a> @megaminimechamocha you think it was reggie? Kappa
[4:54:50] <SethKyu> @mechslayer71 Minh happened
[4:54:53] <%smallboops> woolie defeated himself :V
[4:54:54] <+Jiggisnipe> damn Reggie made him mind game into give up
[4:54:55] <+paladinstarbuster> iff reggie meteors the dragon would woolie get the town
[4:54:56] <SilverHairAlchemist> meteor the monster LUL
[4:55:03] <bevyrage> woolie already defeated, didn't even read renew+
[4:55:08] <%MajorCrasher> GO FOR THE KILL MINH
[4:55:11] <dds333a> @frostedzaibatsu he got D'arby'd
[4:55:20] <+pectusumbra> @bevyrage it did a lot of damage even when he renewed last time
[4:55:21] <+mechslayer71> @pectusumbra @sethkyu with? monkaGiGA
[4:55:23] <+xerotwo> RENEW+ does WHAT? doodBait
[4:55:23] <pjbuster> @pjbuster He really did lose his fighting spirit, D'arby was right
[4:55:26] <+mechslayer71> what*
[4:55:27] <+RyTYoung> Wait wait wait...when did Kicks become Bobby Kotick?!?! WutFace WutFace WutFace doodYelp doodYelp doodYelp WutFace WutFace WutFace
[4:55:33] <C4m3r0n0409> Woolie never could have won with that mindset
[4:55:48] <Asuterisuku> @RyTYoung Minh was throwing out psychic damage.
[4:56:06] <andre11dr> WHAT IF....THE MONSTER MOVES NOW?
[4:56:06] <bevyrage> @pectusumbra it was enough recovery and damage reduction to let him survive the hit this turn
[4:56:07] <+pingu_crimson> or he could use an item and see what happens
[4:56:08] <+Jiggisnipe> Renew+ would not have killed Woolie but a strike and maybe an attack would
[4:56:19] <C4m3r0n0409> If the monster moves I will die of laughter
[4:56:19] <+Jack8274> Min: "I remember but maybe not"
[4:56:21] <dds333a> @paladinstarbuster monsters can't die on the field
[4:56:24] <+RyTYoung> @asuterisuku awww sheit
[4:56:28] <+pingu_crimson> the cave store does
[4:56:40] <+tomdwarf> this game is such BS, that no choice he could make was safe enough to feel "good"
[4:56:44] <%fetrigon> data: bobbykotik LUL
[4:57:05] <SethKyu> Were golashes in the cave shop?
[4:57:11] <%fetrigon> I'm sure a lot of people are looking for a file like that LUL
[4:57:12] <dds333a> LUL LUL
[4:57:15] <%smallboops> woolie would have lived if the dragon attacked and he defended
[4:57:21] <%MajorCrasher> I mean this game is all about taking gambles and not being safe. almost nothing is a sure thing in Dokapon
[4:57:26] <%debrv> GO. NOW. REGGIE.
[4:57:29] <%smallboops> with about 200/150 hp
[4:57:29] <Darmanimon> oh no who nicknamed Reggie Bobby Kotik
[4:57:30] <+Jiggisnipe> @smallboops but he would die to balefire and strike
[4:57:33] <+mechslayer71> @tomdwarf welcome my friend
[4:57:35] <+AMagicalFlute> Isn't that just part of the game? Sometimes any choice is a gamble
[4:57:44] <%smallboops> woolie dies to strike 100%
[4:57:48] <%fetrigon> @darmanimon woolieMINHMAX
[4:57:49] <%smallboops> if he doesnt counter
[4:57:56] <%smallboops> so he really had to take the 1/3 guess
[4:58:01] <+Jiggisnipe> also balefire breaks his equipment
[4:58:11] <Darmanimon> @fetrigon that's a genius move if I've ever seen one

[5:06:12] <%Solidnick18> lmao
[5:06:13] <%MajorCrasher> @pectusumbra I mean that'd just help him. he wants to die and go back to the big monster
[5:06:13] <dds333a> @smallboops only through attrition (barely)ohko, or taking his options
[5:06:31] <+pectusumbra> @MajorCrasher send him with no weapon or armor
[5:06:40] <%fetrigon> fighting minh is just a war of attrition.
[5:06:43] <+Grayhammatter> tags: mindbreak
[5:06:45] <%MajorCrasher> they can only take one thing on death
[5:06:55] <%Th3SmartAlec> forever
[5:07:04] <%fetrigon> and minh wins that by default.
[5:07:04] <andre11dr> At this point i genuinely don't know how they can beat that monster, the only way is if it moves
[5:07:05] <+pectusumbra> @MajorCrasher I mean take one of his things
[5:07:09] <%MajorCrasher> armor or weapon not both. plus there's a weapon shop there you can rob

[6:09:58] <+Shady_Zaku> The one ring puts you in danger though doodScrub
[6:10:02] <+tomdwarf> I mean, one ring, in terms of magic items, sucks ass. Its an invisibility ring where you have to make constant will saves.
[6:10:10] <%cubbywolf> Who put crabs in this invisibilty cloak?

[6:10:39] <puluxor> Crab game?
[6:10:44] <Darmanimon> @smallboops look up crabs in a bucket
[6:10:45] <PMda2nd> hold that
[6:10:45] <%notmicrowavesafe> @smallboops crabs in a bucket
[6:10:48] <slackerunchained> Because they're all 'crabs in the bucket'.
[6:10:49] <%Solidnick18> you can then take all the towns
[6:10:51] <dds333a> @smallboops he is referencing the idiom crabs in a bucket
[6:10:54] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[6:10:58] <Asuterisuku> @tomdwarf It's notable that the invisibility doesn't break when performing actions though.
[6:11:06] <%Solidnick18> Crab game is a real game

[6:11:47] <dds333a> "crabs in a bucket" refer to the phenomenon of dragging others down to the bottom of a situation you yourself are trying to escape from instead of cooperating
[6:11:51] <slackerunchained> Evillak is the the only crab to make it out of the bucket.
[6:12:12] <dds333a> @slackerunchained that's why none can survive him
