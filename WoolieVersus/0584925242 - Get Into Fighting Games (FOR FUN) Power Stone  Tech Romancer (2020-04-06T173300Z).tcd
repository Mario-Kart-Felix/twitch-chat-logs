[0:22:47] <jaguarkek318> For Minh
[0:23:19] <Baconrath> i really really need a sound clip of the AH YOU REDDY from this game
[0:23:32] <Baconrath> it would make an excellent stream alert tbh tbh
[0:24:11] <%saltpiggu> @WoolieVersus did you see Core A gaming just came out with a new video?
[0:24:20] <+gantz_zero> i've wanted to see this for so many years
[0:24:20] <speximillian> The Power Stoooooone~
[0:24:34] <+gantz_zero> i'm so happy to see woolie on OG power stone
[0:25:21] <beatie_g> is it me or does the gamma for the game look kinda low
[0:25:21] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:25:37] <+gantz_zero> yeah it's weirdly dark
[0:26:12] <+ser1ousboardgames> hes too excited
[0:26:46] <Andrizzleton> Is it because it's a modded DC?
[0:26:55] <+gantz_zero> presumably, dunno
[0:26:59] <%Solidnick18> oh no
[0:27:15] <+tuchpi> basement king EleGiggle
[0:27:29] <%DensityD> i member
[0:27:41] <@Solidus_113> If there is none, MAKE ONE
[0:27:57] <speximillian> This game is too RNG for proper tournaments. No way to turn off items, gimmicks, or hazards
[0:27:59] <%DensityD> woolie will figure it out
[0:28:01] <MrMysteryMask> i wonder if they're gonna take a look at combat core
[0:28:10] <+gantz_zero> good @speximillian
[0:28:19] <thatjuantoo> HeyGuys
[0:28:23] <+gantz_zero> power stones isn't power stones without items and hazards
[0:28:26] <%DensityD> is woolie going to host more JoJeopardy after the quarentine?
[0:28:44] <%DensityD> oh shit, matching shirts, I just noticed
[0:28:48] <speximillian> Honestly, without items and hazards and Final Smash, this game is really basic lol
[0:28:49] <Super_Voltekka> Smash get dozens of tournaments every year, but Power Stone never gets any despite playing almost just like it FailFish
[0:29:06] <@Solidus_113> 56051
[0:29:07] <ashtray_breathman> fucking play the second one
[0:29:09] <+chubbypencil> OH fuck yeah Power Stone!

[0:29:29] <Andrizzleton> Thank you @WoolieVersus for helping me avoid RE3r spoilers
[0:29:34] <ashtray_breathman> thats right
[0:29:37] <speximillian> Power Stone 2 is...well, it doesn't look as good as PS1, but it has more in it including 3-4 players
[0:29:40] <%FuqBoiSlim> WANG GANG
[0:29:41] <%Solidnick18> Some like my wang and my tang
[0:29:45] <%Irridium> straight up
[0:29:57] <+ser1ousboardgames> you dont scare i dont scare
[0:30:03] <ashtray_breathman> man powerstone 2 had 2 play coop story mode
[0:30:14] <%Irridium> "I'm still getting aquainted sorry" he says as he bodies him
[0:30:28] <MrMysteryMask> dunk the goku
[0:30:52] <jazzygrooves> is Wangtang by chance related to Fong Wong? Kappa
[0:30:56] <Elsewize> Dude just went all Bankai.

[0:31:43] <%lazuli_alter> OH NOOOOOOOOOOO
[0:31:55] <%lazuli_alter> i love the announcer's voice in this
[0:32:40] <Elsewize> Literally super saiyan?
[0:32:40] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:32:45] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[0:32:46] <speximillian> Wang Tang has a Dragon Fist too
[0:32:46] <%DensityD> WAN DURR FULL
[0:33:04] <DannyBlaxonOG> PowerStone needs a comeback
[0:33:15] <%lazuli_alter> The game was released in arcades on the SEGA NAOMI hardware, which is very similar to the Dreamcast's @WoolieVersus
[0:33:31] <+deemellow> Balls EXPOSED
[0:33:33] <+gantz_zero> port this with GGPO and i'd play the fuck out of this
[0:33:33] <+Hunterv96> woolies soul is drained
[0:33:37] <taquito_blade> i never played powerstone but im reminded alot of Spawn and the devils hand
[0:33:56] <%jiggy_snipe> LUL
[0:33:58] <Super_Voltekka> Fun Fact: Falcon's original name was Fokker, but they changed it the way Namco changed Puck-Man's name to Pac-Man
[0:33:59] <speximillian> Power Stone with Online would be amazing
[0:34:12] <+gantz_zero> before his Wang At Midnight obsession Kappa
[0:34:24] <speximillian> Wait, this game is all about Power Stone, why was there no character in MvCi?
[0:34:37] <+gantz_zero> because god is a myth
[0:34:38] <+deemellow> I think the Power Stone Collection is online but dont quote me
[0:34:48] <+Pixelpusher90> Yesssss
[0:34:54] <%jiggy_snipe> Minh gonna fail over 25 cents
[0:35:10] <Super_Voltekka> The same reason Red Earth never got ported anywhere: because Capcom forgot this ga,e exists
[0:35:18] <bona4persona> powerstone? oh shit this brings back salty memories
[0:35:27] <speximillian> Yo I've seen that Powered up Falcon design in Gotcha Force on gamecube
[0:35:33] <+Pixelpusher90> Game rules
[0:36:04] <%FuqBoiSlim> oh no!
[0:36:09] <%CaptainPileDriver> jaaaaaaaaack
[0:36:15] <%lotharrio> Falcon's dad, Hawk.
[0:36:16] <%Irridium> he was in Power Stone 2
[0:36:17] <%CaptainPileDriver> sad there's no chef in this one
[0:36:30] <speximillian> Hawk and Kraken are the secret characters, yeah?
[0:36:39] <+Roivas1991> Isn't his dad playable in Power Stone 2?
[0:36:40] <%FuqBoiSlim> models dont look too bad in this. kinda good really
[0:36:42] <%Irridium> He was a secret character in 2 along with Mel, the shopkeeper
[0:36:49] <%jetjagger222> i think pete was a pinnochio-style puppet or a robot of some sort
[0:36:54] <+Graem> Captain falcon on announcer
[0:38:04] <+Hunterv96> im loving this divekick gameplay
[0:38:19] <speximillian> Game reminds me of Shrek Super Slam and One Piece Grand Battle
[0:38:35] <+gantz_zero> jack is one of my favorite characters ever
[0:39:39] <+gantz_zero> you can catch thrown objects in mid air @WoolieVersus
[0:39:41] <+Graem> YEUSSS
[0:39:41] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:39:43] <JustMeAndOtherPeople> This reminds me of custom robo
[0:40:31] <+unclekulikov> Salt Party bonus episode
[0:40:33] <%DensityD> don't. get. grabbed.
[0:40:33] <Super_Voltekka> Was this game in any of Combo Breaker's mystery tournaments?
[0:40:34] <%jetjagger222> ayame was OP here iirc
[0:40:54] <turbofolk> Where's the fun in fighting games? cancel fighting games
[0:41:03] <%EyeFarted> I completely forgot WANGTANG even existed.
[0:41:17] <%jetjagger222> peak akiman
[0:41:43] <worldbrand> i wish generic anime arena fighters were this
[0:42:03] <GeltonZ> @worldbrand Personally...I find most generic anime arena fighters to be a LOT better than this.
[0:42:05] <petwisk> that crossover between DBZ Naruto and One Piece is a Power Stone clone
[0:42:09] <@Solidus_113> I have a Powerstone-like ready to show off if I'm given the chance
[0:42:22] <GeltonZ> @petwisk No it's not, it's a Smash clone...and has the worst unlock system ever.
[0:42:23] <@Solidus_113> Jump Force is NOT powerstone
[0:42:25] <majima666> oh no!
[0:42:42] <GeltonZ> @Solidus_113 He's talking about Battle Stradium DON which is a Smash clone.
[0:42:59] <+tuchpi> LUL
[0:43:03] <%Solidnick18> lol
[0:43:10] <worldbrand> i mean i have zero love for anime arena fighters. like, i feel 3/10 about em
[0:43:26] <+liquidzr0> gwd6 minh is broken
[0:43:27] <+deemellow> shout out to combat core
[0:43:28] <thatjuantoo> FBtouchdown
[0:43:53] <@Solidus_113> "back off and be a bitch"
[0:43:58] <%DensityD> GET SERIOUS
[0:44:04] <%DensityD> GET SIRI US
[0:44:09] <GeltonZ> @worldbrand See that makes me really sad because every anime arena fighter is radically different and comes from different companies. Some are good, some are okay, some are shit.
[0:44:09] <%CaptainPileDriver> NO CAUSE YOU ONLY PLAY POSTER BOYS
[0:44:10] <+Hunterv96> don't play final destination play warioware
[0:44:15] <Super_Voltekka> Get Sirius/XM
[0:44:18] <%jetjagger222> BGM here is a banger
[0:44:25] <%jetjagger222> very vampire savior
[0:44:56] <%jinking79> shit anybody remember the anime to this
[0:44:58] <GeltonZ> @worldbrand But personally as much as I love the World/Characters of Power Stone, I find the first game painfully shallow. One Piece Grand Adventure is like this but SO much better.
[0:45:00] <%jetjagger222> yes
[0:45:04] <worldbrand> @GeltonZ you can also take my opinion with a grain of salt because i am ass at fighting games overall and scarcely touch em
[0:45:19] <GeltonZ> @jinking79 I do. I was super salty about the US release. Finding uncensored episodes is impossible.
[0:45:26] <%jetjagger222> they censored rouge's pants
[0:45:32] <GeltonZ> @worldbrand Understandable, just you're VERY not alone.
[0:45:44] <Super_Voltekka> Does Budokai Tenkaichi 3 still hold up in a post-DBFZ world?
[0:45:57] <GeltonZ> @jetjagger222 Yes and no, her pants are the same in both versions of the anime butyeah they aren't transparent.
[0:45:58] <bleugh> OH NO
[0:46:12] <+gantz_zero> 7 letters
[0:46:27] <%jetjagger222> @GeltonZ yeah i was comparing the game and anime art
[0:46:31] <+liquidzr0> that was very disrespectful
[0:46:46] <%CaptainPileDriver> minh, it's okay, this show is nothing but salt
[0:46:46] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1242929035937820672?s=20
[0:46:55] <+Hunterv96> soul stealing is honorable, minh is a true hero
[0:46:58] <GeltonZ> @jetjagger222 Yeah the anime is a bit toned down since it's meant to be a kids show. The Japanese opening theme is AMAZING though.
[0:47:20] <+deemellow> Power Stone 1 actually has s combo tree sorta unlike 2
[0:47:21] <+gantz_zero> by aya and chika, no less @GeltonZ
[0:47:31] <%jetjagger222> i remember the anime turning jack into a blanka-esque MOMMA type
[0:47:45] <%jetjagger222> and he acted a lot like gollum
[0:48:24] <%jetjagger222> ronin warriors!
[0:48:26] <+gantz_zero> literally just, catch the object
[0:48:31] <+gantz_zero> do they not know
[0:49:22] <superchronicc> this game is sick
[0:49:24] <DaRoosta89> PEEEERFECT
[0:49:28] <yeetdabsenpai69> perfect
[0:49:30] <%Solidnick18> perfect
[0:49:31] <+Qsmash_> any Galuda mains?
[0:49:31] <+liquidzr0> gwdSip destroyed
[0:49:34] <+Hunterv96> minty fresh
[0:49:35] <+deemellow> STOMPED
[0:50:00] <GeltonZ> MAN this game makes me sad. They make it look SO cool, but the dive kicks are completely broken and the combat is SO shallow. I do not understand how anyone can enjoy this game 1 on 1.
[0:50:40] <+Qsmash_> it's not that serious
[0:50:49] <%jetjagger222> to be fair it was kind of the first in its genre
[0:51:00] <+deemellow> @geltonz theres deeper stuff here but you need to go check out guides
[0:51:04] <GeltonZ> @jetjagger222 Ehrgeiz came first and is better once you learn it.
[0:51:13] <Elsewize> She's uh... yeah. Not leavin' much to imagination there. o_O
[0:51:53] <GeltonZ> @deemellow I've been looking into it for years and I can't find shit. Mostly because "spam dive kick, do power fusion" is too good.
[0:52:25] <+deemellow> @geltonz if you say so my bröther
[0:52:52] <GeltonZ> XD Okay now I feel like an ass for pouring out my Capcom salt.
[0:52:54] <+Hunterv96> between constantly yelling oh no and throwing random shit at your enemies i am getting serious joseph vibes
[0:52:58] <%jetjagger222> @GeltonZ i do recall the options and movesets being bigger in ehrgeiz, but it didn't quite feel as "platformy" as this
[0:53:41] <GeltonZ> @jetjagger222 Spot on assessment. Ehrgeiz has way more options but the controls are weird and the gameplay confusing. I respect it but I could never figure it out.
[0:53:41] <+gantz_zero> thank god
[0:53:54] <+gantz_zero> i was dying when they thought it was just almost guaranteed damage
[0:53:54] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:54:23] <%baragon600> baragon600 subscribed with Twitch Prime.
[0:54:40] <%jetjagger222> the other thing with ehrgeiz was that the character designs were kind of janky; like nomura-flavored walmart tekken
[0:55:09] <%Irridium> the gun is real strong
[0:55:12] <thatjuantoo> @jetjagger222 Those are a lot of words LUL
[0:55:14] <GeltonZ> @jetjagger222 YUP. I didn't think they were bad. I love Jo and ESPECIALLY Claire but yeah they didn't pop.
[0:55:14] <%jetjagger222> kind of literally with godhand aka ken mishima
[0:55:25] <%Solidnick18> nice
[0:55:28] <+liquidzr0> minh is actually a boss at this
[0:55:31] <+BoomerxDoomer> bruh they gave re3 a 58%
[0:55:35] <LeaIsChill> Is this 🅱️ower Stone?
[0:55:37] <%jetjagger222> minh has taken the old fisticuffs woolie role
[0:55:47] <+deemellow> Ryoma has the best damage for regular attacking if i remember correctly but long recovery times after a miss
[0:56:15] <+BoomerxDoomer> are u gonna do a rematch with mad cats lord himself again ?
[0:56:18] <+akira_chong> @jetjagger222 how? Boss characters?
[0:56:36] <%jetjagger222> winrate, familiarity with the game
[0:56:38] <+gantz_zero> god i have defenses against this chick's supers memorized, that i forgot i had memorized
[0:56:41] <+gantz_zero> weird memories
[0:56:51] <+akira_chong> oh. heh.
[0:56:55] <%jetjagger222> iirc the bosses here were not that OP; kraken was bad
[0:56:55] <zamzoph> When's Power Stone 2 tho
[0:57:12] <+BoomerxDoomer> can i have some black out god drink?
[0:57:13] <+gantz_zero> i'd kill to see them fight vlagas and final valgas
[0:58:11] <%jetjagger222> ayame is really strong
[0:58:12] <+gantz_zero> so many hours of my life getting ripped apart by valgas as a kid
[0:58:41] <+deemellow> Her lifeless eyes
[0:59:02] <%jetjagger222> her fusion is amoon rabbit themed ninja
[0:59:46] <%jetjagger222> ROCK AND ROLL
[0:59:51] <+gantz_zero> DOKAN
[1:00:36] <+VariantX7> Anyone like Power Stone 1 more than 2 because of the 1 v 1 aspect?
[1:00:44] <+gantz_zero> me 100%
[1:00:48] <%jetjagger222> @VariantX7 they're very different games
[1:01:17] <+gantz_zero> i never got into power stone 2 because of how over the top it got compared to this
[1:01:18] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:01:20] <%jetjagger222> KINNIKU BUSTER
[1:01:32] <+gantz_zero> holy shit saved by accidental burning
[1:01:59] <+deemellow> I like 1 better than 2 cause of the combo tree system and in PS Collection you can unlock all or near all 2 characters in 1
[1:02:30] <+gantz_zero> 100%
[1:02:33] <+VariantX7> what PS2 charas are in PS1???
[1:02:44] <+gantz_zero> only via the collection
[1:02:44] <+deemellow> Yes in collection
[1:02:51] <+VariantX7> what platform??
[1:02:55] <+deemellow> psp
[1:03:07] <+gantz_zero> you could emulate it tbh
[1:03:09] <+gantz_zero> ppsspp
[1:03:11] <+VariantX7> this...this changes everything...
[1:03:15] <%jetjagger222> PSP version was sweet, put so much time into that in college
[1:03:36] <+deemellow> They require beating the arcade alot....god the boss fights
[1:03:49] <+gantz_zero> the boss fights are very readable though
[1:03:59] <+gantz_zero> i'd say they aren't that difficult to get used to
[1:04:00] <%CaptainPileDriver> man i wish the samsho online wasn't dead on ps4
[1:04:16] <BurdRightsActivist> What is this bad smash game?
[1:04:23] <BurdRightsActivist> Not even melee smh damn casual
[1:04:26] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Boo this man
[1:04:28] <%jetjagger222> try hurling stuff at someone as they land
[1:04:33] <%jetjagger222> from a jump
[1:04:46] <RickMontez> Hello
[1:05:09] <%jetjagger222> @RickMontez greetings
[1:05:18] <+gantz_zero> i love that even reggie is saying oh no now
[1:05:20] <+deemellow> @gantz_zero The boat lord really hurt me especially being forced to play characters i dont like
[1:05:34] <%jiggy_snipe> it's so contagious lol
[1:05:38] <+VariantX7> I remember playing that demo to death that came with the DC. there was so much interactivity with the little enviroments
[1:05:42] <+gantz_zero> kraken can be rough, that's true @deemellow
[1:05:55] <%jetjagger222> i don't remember there being food pickups in 1
[1:06:51] <+gantz_zero> i love that supers are super situational, amazing and also just completely avoidable
[1:06:52] <BurdRightsActivist> CAUGHT THAT SHIT
[1:07:00] <BurdRightsActivist> "No u"
[1:07:14] <+deemellow> DAMN bodied
[1:07:15] <+VariantX7> game still looks clean af

[1:08:45] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:08:50] <+VariantX7> the fact that we don't have power stone and project justice remasters is a crime
[1:09:11] <%jetjagger222> @VariantX7 i'm spitballing but something probably happened to the source code or assets
[1:09:48] <+deemellow> Dont make me cry on this holy day
[1:10:05] <+gantz_zero> my guess is they just don't think it'd sell enough to recoup the cost of the effort
[1:10:08] <+gantz_zero> no matter how minimal
[1:10:10] <+gantz_zero> at least currently
[1:10:10] <%jetjagger222> that too

[1:15:59] <%jetjagger222> the mech designs were by the same studio that did the ones for macross
[1:16:05] <majima666> i found out not that long ago that evil zone is made by yukes
[1:16:06] <+primax104> thats just mazinger/mazinkaiser
[1:16:12] <odd_slater> ^^
[1:16:18] <%SuperKirby24> wew
[1:16:25] <majima666> and it has paul eiding in it
[1:16:43] <+VariantX7> I still kind of wanted a cyberbots 2 though. The mixing and matching of parts was pretty sick
[1:16:47] <%jetjagger222> @majima666 the bleach fighting games actually use a very similar engine IIRC; at least the PSP ones
[1:16:53] <SomersaultJustice> there's not charlie
[1:16:58] <%DensityD> when did mecha week 2 start?
[1:17:00] <%DensityD> IMMEDIATELY AFTER MECHA WEEK 1!!
[1:17:13] <%DensityD> when did mecha week 4 start?
[1:17:18] <%DensityD> EVERY WEEK, IN YOUR HEART
[1:17:20] <+gantz_zero> NOWWWWWWWWWW
[1:17:26] <+gantz_zero> or that
[1:17:27] <odd_slater> My two favorite weeks on SBFP
[1:17:30] <%jetjagger222> dixen's finisher is straight up the gundam last shooting
[1:17:35] <zamzoph> He has funnels!
[1:17:36] <+VariantX7> that is fucking alphonse
[1:17:52] <%jetjagger222> and the pilot's voiced by amuro's VA
[1:17:55] <%Exyoh> Legally distinct Saotome Labs right there in the back
[1:17:59] <%DensityD> @gantz_zero <3
[1:18:04] <odd_slater> They should play Gundam EX VS Maxi Boot when that comes out
[1:18:11] <@Solidus_113> <<WISE DUCK>>
[1:18:22] <+gantz_zero> @DensityD <3
[1:18:32] <crimsonsaens> If Gundam has taught me anything, then the best strat is to just spam funnels
[1:18:33] <%jetjagger222> the pilot for gourai (red sword mech) is voiced by char's VA
[1:18:42] <%DensityD> you wish the dreamcast had a L2
[1:18:52] <zamzoph> hit him with the pilebunker!
[1:19:06] <%DensityD> that's pretty hype
[1:19:12] <GeltonZ> What are they trying to figure out?
[1:19:20] <crimsonsaens> Someone should be looking up the faq for this
[1:19:21] <+gantz_zero> everything
[1:19:22] <%DensityD> controls and combos
[1:19:27] <+VariantX7> yo did I miss if these guys these gusy played virtual on yet?
[1:19:29] <%CaptainPileDriver> people who don't hit anything in the rematch screen and let the timer run out are scum
[1:19:30] <%DensityD> waggle and mash
[1:19:31] <+pferschaw> what's this game?
[1:19:35] <%Solidnick18> YOOO
[1:19:37] <%DensityD> the best gameplay Kappa
[1:19:41] <+pferschaw> still powerstone?
[1:19:44] <%DensityD> this is Techromancer
[1:19:44] <%CaptainPileDriver> nah
[1:19:47] <GeltonZ> @pferschaw Tech Romancer. It's like if Capcom made Evil Zone but with mechs.
[1:19:48] <SomersaultJustice> push the button to make minmay sing the song
[1:19:50] <%jetjagger222> the icons are special weapons
[1:19:51] <crimsonsaens> Obviously it's Powerstone
[1:19:56] <+pferschaw> dope
[1:20:01] <Super_Voltekka> Is this the same announcer as Alpha 3?
[1:20:03] <%CaptainPileDriver> the twitch stream says powerstone sadly
[1:20:05] <%jetjagger222> you can throw someone to stun them then you can land your finisher
[1:20:27] <%DensityD> in the business, we call that a hit confirm or throw confirm
[1:20:31] <GeltonZ> There's a control reference on the pause screen.
[1:20:31] <SomersaultJustice> AND THEN HE DIES
[1:20:32] <%jetjagger222> all four IIRC
[1:20:35] <%Solidnick18> he died
[1:20:44] <majima666> @Super_Voltekka nah, doesnt sound like him. i wish though
[1:20:44] <%jetjagger222> supers are bf AB or fb AB
[1:20:58] <GeltonZ> Finisher is all four buttons. Super is Back-Forward A+B or Forward-Back A+B
[1:21:04] <%jiggy_snipe> Yo Yo Man Kappa
[1:21:05] <%DensityD> D for in your Dreams, woolie
[1:21:06] <%CaptainPileDriver> BEYBLADE??
[1:21:10] <+VariantX7> GEAR FIGHTER DENDOH
[1:21:14] <%jetjagger222> did the audio go out for anyone else
[1:21:23] <%CaptainPileDriver> holy shit
[1:21:23] <Andrizzleton> YO! Woolie just reminded me he should play BANGAIO
[1:21:29] <GeltonZ> @jetjagger222 Nope
[1:21:30] <%DensityD> twin zam, but WHERE'S BIG ZAM
[1:21:36] <%CaptainPileDriver> mazinger is the shit
[1:21:37] <%DensityD> hey look big zam
[1:21:38] <%CaptainPileDriver> he fights hades
[1:21:41] <%jetjagger222> muted by mistake
[1:21:58] <+gantz_zero> yeah i'm seeing ultraman more than anything
[1:22:06] <GeltonZ> Pulsion is Ultaman + Eva but mostly Ultraman.
[1:22:06] <Super_Voltekka> Jin Saotome is in this game too
[1:22:17] <OBS_VinnieK> This game still looks glorious even today
[1:22:21] <%Exyoh> There's some Yokoyama aesthetics in there
[1:22:25] <+gantz_zero> it's got strong art
[1:22:27] <%jetjagger222> gkaiser AB is super unsafe
[1:22:46] <+VariantX7> rocket punch is hella unsafe as expected
[1:22:57] <+deemellow> This looks hype
[1:22:57] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:23:02] <%DensityD> japanizing BEEEEAAAAM
[1:23:02] <%SuperKirby24> yoooo beam clashes lol
[1:23:03] <JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[1:23:19] <GeltonZ> The main guy behind this game is Shouji Kawamori, he did the mech designs for Macross...and Eureka 7...and a few Transformers...and Armored Core...and Daemon X Machina and...pretty much everything. He's a very prolific mecha designer and this game is his baby.
[1:23:21] <+gantz_zero> well yeah that's like episode end
[1:23:40] <%jetjagger222> you need to throw to stun and land it, or use it as a punish
[1:23:46] <%Solidnick18> YOOOO
[1:23:53] <crimsonsaens> Astral Finish
[1:23:54] <%SuperKirby24> ded
[1:23:54] <GeltonZ> @WoolieVersus Super is Back-Foward A+B or Forward-Back A+B. No charge.
[1:23:58] <%Solidnick18> i wanted a space izuna drop
[1:23:59] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Eureka 7 <3
[1:24:20] <DSD24> I like the Pilot of Diana 17 she looks cool
[1:24:23] <%DensityD> woolieFUN ?
[1:24:26] <crimsonsaens> Pulsion reminds me of Ultraman with that beam
[1:24:36] <zamzoph> Is this Rising Thunder?
[1:24:39] <%jetjagger222> diana is aerial specialized
[1:24:41] <GeltonZ> Diana 17 uses the Mobile Trace System.
[1:24:46] <odd_slater> I wonder how the Anno Ultraman will be
[1:24:47] <+deemellow> I miss Rising Thunder
[1:24:49] <+VariantX7> Fei Yen
[1:24:53] <+gantz_zero> i'm just seeing sailor moon tbh
[1:24:54] <billmurraysbong> Ellie from xenogeras as well
[1:25:03] <DSD24> This looks like Nobel Gundam from G Gundam
[1:25:08] <No3rdImpactPlz> @VariantX7 Thank you, I was just about to type that out.
[1:25:08] <odd_slater> ^
[1:25:08] <GeltonZ> @odd_slater HOLY CRAP he gets to make an Ultraman?! That's like a dream come true for him! Hooray!
[1:25:14] <%DensityD> I almost wish I was as weeb as this chat LUL
[1:25:15] <zamzoph> Is Virtual On a fighting game? 🤔
[1:25:18] <majima666> is it judgment that has virtua on in the arcades?
[1:25:19] <%SuperKirby24> @gantz_zero imagine sailor moon but with mechas LUL
[1:25:20] <%DensityD> VoHiYo
[1:25:26] <%jetjagger222> @majima666 kiwami 2
[1:25:29] <GeltonZ> @zamzoph It's considered a "Projectile Fighter"
[1:25:33] <+gantz_zero> @SuperKirby24 i'd watch 8 seasons of that
[1:25:37] <%Solidnick18> YES
[1:25:39] <odd_slater> @GeltonZ Yep first Shin Godzilla now Shin Ultraman
[1:25:46] <GeltonZ> @odd_slater Fuck yeah!
[1:25:52] <%jetjagger222> final is ABCD
[1:25:52] <+deemellow> Arms is a projectile fighter
[1:25:56] <majima666> ahhh, been that many games in the last few years they kinda mesh in some parts lol
[1:26:01] <%Solidnick18> @majima666 yes
[1:26:28] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> They're giant corrosive bubbles, just go with that lol
[1:26:28] <%Solidnick18> judgment has viruta fighter and virtual on
[1:26:30] <BionoidLCR> yoooooooooooooooooooooo
[1:26:31] <crimsonsaens> Most mechs only have a D or C rank capability in water, it makes perfect sense
[1:26:34] <BionoidLCR> POWER STONE
[1:26:55] <Elsewize> What game is this??
[1:27:02] <odd_slater> @GeltonZ He writing it this time around though where as he wrote and directed Shin Godzilla

[1:28:37] <%jetjagger222> pilot of rafaga is voiced by koyasu takehito; aka dio
[1:28:38] <DSD24> That's the best gundam fighting game
[1:28:47] <GeltonZ> Gourai's pilot is Char in one universe and the main character's brainwashed Dad in the Super Robot universe.
[1:28:52] <SheefEatsBeef> STARSCREAM

[1:29:32] <SheefEatsBeef> METAL GEAR
[1:29:33] <DSD24> I like Sazabi
[1:29:37] <GeltonZ> @WoolieVersus This game was MADE by the Macross mecha designer. He headed the project and was his idea it seems. So...yeah...
[1:29:40] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Harmony Gold caused so much bullshit with Battletech too
[1:29:41] <GeltonZ> Gerwalk/Guardian
[1:30:31] <%DensityD> just do normals

[1:31:01] <DSD24> Yo that pose is sick
[1:31:09] <%jetjagger222> you need to setup finishers using the grab/stun move; hold block then input forward, forward
[1:31:14] <zamzoph> Demon X Machina
[1:31:16] <%SuperKirby24> daemon x?
[1:31:16] <@Solidus_113> Daemon X Machina

[1:31:22] <%Solidnick18> daemon x machina
[1:31:27] <JetpackMcQuack> We are your memory now
[1:31:29] <%Irridium> Daemon that's it
[1:31:32] <DSD24> Red Lord
[1:31:33] <%FuqBoiSlim> Daemon x Machina?
[1:31:37] <Super_Voltekka> You better show off all the final attacks after you're through
[1:31:41] <%SuperKirby24> Doraemon x Machina Kappa
[1:31:44] <GeltonZ> Grown-up Pollin is my favorite character in this game.
[1:31:51] <Bennett_Fracture> short term memory lost eh...
[1:31:52] <%jetjagger222> i have no idea what bollon is based off
[1:31:55] <SheefEatsBeef> what the fuck is that thing

[1:32:14] <%jetjagger222> boss borot is an ork mech
[1:32:33] <%Exyoh> There are TWO fat goofballs in Getter Robo
[1:32:34] <+VariantX7> the robot that would actually be made in a cave with a box of scraps
[1:32:35] <%DensityD> why is Lanky Kong in a mecha fighting game?
[1:32:41] <%DensityD> where's tronne?
[1:32:44] <SheefEatsBeef> LENS GLARE BRO
[1:32:47] <GeltonZ> Pollin's story mode turns the game into Tenchi.
[1:33:03] <JustMeAndOtherPeople> Look at these tron combos Kappa
[1:33:24] <%DensityD> LUL
[1:33:29] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[1:33:30] <Super_Voltekka> Spooky never covered this game AFAIK
[1:33:40] <GeltonZ> High level play actually isn't that impressive. This is a super simplistic game really.
[1:33:41] <venomryu> alll magical girl bull shit
[1:33:43] <zamzoph> so what makes her transform into grownup with big honkers?
[1:33:49] <%Solidnick18> yeyeye

[1:33:57] <GeltonZ> @zamzoph Super Mode. She doesn't do it nearly enough.
[1:33:58] <@Solidus_113> Pacific Rim Uprising, specifically
[1:34:05] <GeltonZ> @zamzoph It's an item.

[1:36:22] <NevikGamina> FUNNELS
[1:36:34] <$captainpeaches> Daisuke Gori voice
[1:36:38] <%jetjagger222> destroid monster
[1:36:51] <%jetjagger222> or if you want, the stone rhino from mechwarrior/battletech
[1:36:52] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Wise Duck looks like a Marauder or some shit from Battletech yeah lol
[1:36:54] <Super_Voltekka> I wonder if the stole the Vic Viper's ZoE 2 design from Dixen
[1:37:41] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> We're never gonna see these cool attacks land FeelsBadMan
[1:37:41] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:37:44] <GeltonZ> @NewAndTastySixthHouse Looks closest to the Monster II from Macross, but as old Battletech took a lot of designs from Robotech (hence the Harmony Gold BS) that does mean Shouji Kawamori designed a lot of Mechwarrior mechs.
[1:37:55] <%Solidnick18> nice
[1:38:01] <NevikGamina> murdered LUL
[1:38:14] <GeltonZ> @NewAndTastySixthHouse AND THEN! When they released Battletech in Japan, they hired Shouji Kawamori to RE-DESIGN them!
[1:38:18] <%jetjagger222> the unblockable stun move sets up the finisher; hold block then input forward, forward
[1:38:31] <+paladinstarbuster> too old for gurren
[1:38:42] <@Solidus_113> Gurren was 2007
[1:38:43] <GeltonZ> @WoolieVersus Dixen's finisher is indeed Final Shooting.
[1:38:46] <DSD24> Head and Arm destroyed
[1:38:51] <$LetsGitGud> Woolie lookin cool today
[1:38:52] <BaslerJones> he last bean
[1:39:01] <+OmegaWeltall> oh shit Tech Romanceer?! PogChamp

[1:39:11] <%DensityD> SwiftRage gigaton! kill.buster!
[1:39:20] <DSD24> @TopTieramisu Mech Romancer is a real game though

[1:40:05] <Super_Voltekka> So it's about robot prostitutes then? UWot
[1:40:17] <GeltonZ> @WoolieVersus But Diana 17 uses the G Gundam mobile trace system so it's also Nobel Gundam.
[1:40:25] <DSD24> @Super_Voltekka Nah the AI in your robot you can date
[1:40:27] <+VariantX7> thats a god damn finisher
[1:40:54] <%jetjagger222> rafaga super and finisher are hype
[1:41:00] <%CaptainPileDriver> this is way better than pat's "april fools GOTCHA" JOKE
[1:41:14] <venomryu> @WoolieVersus jin soatomi is also in this game
[1:41:19] <dunkle321> Aye UltraSeven
[1:41:21] <DSD24> Isn't the Pulsion pilot naked while Piloting it?
[1:41:33] <TheZearGuy> With constant giant robot attack looming overhead, think the rents cheap in those buildings?
[1:41:40] <GeltonZ> @DSD24 Pulsion, I THINK, is actually the pilot transformed.
[1:41:43] <%jetjagger222> @DSD24 technically, beccause they actually become pulsion
[1:41:57] <DSD24> @GeltonZ @jetjagger222 Oh cool I didn't know that
[1:42:12] <dunkle321> Yeah Pulsion is a big Ultraman reference
[1:42:24] <GeltonZ> @WoolieVersus Dude have you PLAYED the Story Mode? It's AMAZING! They DO all have their own shows! Heck it even takes place across multiple universes as that one guy is Char in one universe and Racer X but Dad in the other.
[1:42:48] <GeltonZ> @WoolieVersus This game is basically Capcom's version of Evil Zone...so yeah Capcom kinda improved that...
[1:42:49] <%jetjagger222> @WoolieVersus hold block and input forward forward to stun and setup for finisher
[1:43:12] <DSD24> @GeltonZ I was trying to remember that games name
[1:43:19] <@Solidus_113> NotLikeThis
[1:43:45] <GeltonZ> @DSD24 For some reason, 3 games based on the idea of playing a TV show came out around the same time: Evil Zone, Tech Romancer, and Geppy-X.

[1:44:15] <%jetjagger222> @WoolieVersus its kind of like a focus attack, its slow and absorbs projectiles but you take damage
[1:44:21] <DSD24> Yo that mech has Boat Shoes
[1:44:37] <GeltonZ> Holy crap Woolie admitted Evil Zone has good parts!
[1:44:56] <%jetjagger222> that's exactly what the story mode for this is; even has branching paths based on who you finish

[1:47:57] <%DensityD> shinji get in the robot
[1:48:02] <DSD24> Because they are easier to control Woolie
[1:48:03] <%jiggy_snipe> Huey did nothing wrong guys

[1:55:34] <%jetjagger222> hey that's the guyver's mega smasher
[1:55:43] <crimsonsaens> @zamzoph It should be a crime to be that wrong
[1:55:44] <%DensityD> You can cancel it out into a motherfucking heavy punch ultra, but I ain’t gonna do that shit, ah. It drops after motherfucking fifty nine hits motherfucker, that shit’s crazy. Fifty four, fifty five. When you’re doing it in the corner, don’t hold straight diagonal, after motherfucking two to four hits it’ll drop, just like that.
[1:55:45] <DSD24> GM Sniper 2 White Dingo Version

[1:58:32] <venomryu> @WoolieVersus the command list tells you how to do final attacks

[1:59:06] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:59:34] <GeltonZ> @WoolieVersus Only the Finish is all buttons
[1:59:34] <%jetjagger222> Final Attack ============ When your opponent has no more "downs" left (i.e. another victory will end the stage), and they are hit for 50% damage (yellow damage included), a red and yellow sign will appear beneath your robot's name at the top of the screen, and a warning siren will sound, indicating that the Final Attack is now available. To activate the Final Attack, press all four regular buttons at the same time, (A) + (B) + (J) + (G).

[2:11:44] <worldbrand> "lonely rolling no more" is the one in katamari forever where the singer and the subject reunite
[2:11:47] <worldbrand> it's a duet, it's really cute
[2:11:54] <fangovafang> not bad
[2:12:15] <@Solidus_113> I wish I picked up the HD version of HFTF before they were delisted
[2:12:20] <%jetjagger222> the singer's pronounciation improved through the stanzas; although the "rolling" is still occidental
