[0:03:42] <Mothman742> #MODREGGIE

[0:04:24] <@Solidus_113> The next DMC3 Switch announcement dropped. You can switch between all weapons like Dante can in DMC5
[0:04:27] <%freemoneymanforreal> woolieS woolieT
[0:04:39] <%freemoneymanforreal> woolieF woolieU
[0:04:41] <%Irridium> not only that but it's got a radial menu too
[0:04:47] <Mothman742> #MODREGGIE
[0:04:49] <petwisk> actualy better than 5
[0:05:01] <SilverWolfX9> hi mothman
[0:05:09] <+cvp5127> could you switch in 4?
[0:05:12] <SolSwagGuy56> Hot Take aside freom Devil Trigger and Silver Bullet DMC5's soundtrack sucks
[0:05:14] <Prevot> no new feature they add will fill the cross shaped hole that smash announcement left in my heart
[0:05:21] <algi80> man, can't wait for the 2nd half of Spec Ops
[0:05:25] <%optimasmaximas> I thought people leaked that awhile ago solidus
[0:05:26] <+unclekulikov> There was an army recruiting ad while loading into the stream.. Now THATS IRONIC
[0:05:35] <devil_may_cum_> @solswagguy56 Agreed
[0:05:41] <VidulaSaix> V's theme is good in game but on its own it's kinda ass
[0:05:42] <SilverWolfX9> cant wait for william peterson to make his appearance
[0:05:47] <+mrhandsss> spec ops? schedule was a lie then huh
[0:05:49] <sunsetserenity1> I got the same ad
[0:05:56] <SolSwagGuy56> Has Woolie crossed the Spec Ops: The Line yet?
[0:05:58] <%DesertPenguin> Nice, V's song from DMC5
[0:06:10] <Prevot> schedule was a lie, just like america was a lie
[0:06:13] <devil_may_cum_> DMC 3 ost is just unbeatable for me, with 4 being a close second
[0:06:28] <+mrhandsss> cant see VODs either
[0:06:34] <MyNameIsRasus> i mean woolie is a liar (who stole my pie)
[0:06:42] <SomersaultJustice> it's wolly time
[0:07:01] <SolSwagGuy56> Yeah I don't get why they switched to this edgy DmCish type soundtrack
[0:07:14] <%gatorafan> Woolie woolieVS Dubai
[0:07:16] <pirateofpie> ...yeah, what happened to the VOD's?
[0:07:20] <Mothman742> chat who would have an easier time doing a backflip? minh, reggie, or woolie?
[0:07:27] <ouijabirds> does anyone have any coronavirus that they would be willing to share with the fam?
[0:07:30] <+Valask> oh god this game
[0:07:31] <%Irridium> I'll be real I never really liked any DMC ost. Like apart from 2-3 songs from each game it's all kinda underwhelming
[0:07:35] <LeaIsChill> VODs are down on all of Twitch right now
[0:07:46] <+Cornet_Lars> @ouijabirds I've got a cough?
[0:07:58] <foghornleghorn55> are they gonna finish the game today?
[0:07:59] <devil_may_cum_> @ouijabirds There’s an outbreak where I live apparently so I got you

[0:09:11] <devil_may_cum_> Busta*
[0:09:13] <SolSwagGuy56> @devil_may_cum_ It's Dante's shitty generic Tshirt in 5 that kills it for me
[0:09:21] <%DesertPenguin> oh no he said the bad N word lol
[0:09:30] <foghornleghorn55> dmc4 nero > dmc5 nero dmc5 dante > dmc4 dante
[0:09:37] <+MrRabbles> what is this mashup
[0:09:39] <+Nobrev> pogonaThink
[0:09:55] <devil_may_cum_> @solswagguy56 Oh yeah that didn’t look great, honestly I think he looks best in DMC 2 ironically enough
[0:10:12] <Futurecity10> Choke jerkman was prime comedy
[0:10:23] <MyNameIsRasus> nah fam dmc5 nero and dmc4 dante is where it's at.
[0:10:31] <SolSwagGuy56> @devil_may_cum_ Yeah or DMC2. Maybe even 3 if he put a fuckin shirt on
[0:10:44] <Futurecity10> Not a fan of 5 nero
[0:10:54] <SolSwagGuy56> Why does DMC5 hate Nero and Dante dressing not like hobos?
[0:10:58] <vVAstrAVv> someone link this mashup please
[0:11:00] <Morning_Asakura> dmc 5 nero is literally peak nero
[0:11:02] <+Damie904> Look up Busta Rhymes P5, it'll come up
[0:11:04] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @SilverWolfX9
[0:11:10] <SilverWolfX9> reeeee
[0:11:16] <OldOnyx> mostly just liked his jacket better in 4
[0:11:23] <OldOnyx> nero that is
[0:11:28] <SolSwagGuy56> I like DMC5 Nero's coat and hair. Nero's shirt in 5 is disgusting
[0:11:36] <devil_may_cum_> I didn’t like a lot of the DMC 5 designs honestly especially the ultra realistic faces
[0:11:48] <Mothman742> yooo its time

[0:14:32] <SolSwagGuy56> ;)
[0:14:41] <coreybom> @solswagguy56 I was talking about Dante being dirty. Plus, I don't buy Nero looking to be Really stylish.
[0:14:47] <%DesertPenguin> I thought the PS button still went to XMB
[0:14:49] <Solidnick18> hello
[0:14:59] <SolSwagGuy56> Ooh more hot takes. FUCK the PS4 controller it breaks so easy
[0:15:00] <DatAsuna> You mean select
[0:15:00] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:15:03] <petwisk> Share is Select
[0:15:21] <+Cornet_Lars> Isn't Back XBox?
[0:15:36] <DatAsuna> No back button on PS3
[0:15:38] <SolSwagGuy56> @coreybom Like I'm not even talking like a Jojo shirt. Get my boy a shitty Travis Touchdown t shirt at least. Get the guy to Goodwil or something
[0:15:59] <MyNameIsRasus> @solswagguy56 really? had mine for like two years, dropped it like a ton of times and it works fine
[0:16:24] <damascussteele> i bet the color light doesnt even change unplayable!
[0:16:31] <SolSwagGuy56> @MyNameIsRasus I have broken or damaged 3. Then again I play a lot of fighting games on them
[0:16:33] <Prevot> please look forward to the DS5 having even worse battery life than the DS4

[0:16:50] <+CatastropheCorvid> If you're on PC, use DS4Windows. you can map any button to any keyboard function.
[0:16:50] <SolSwagGuy56> @Prevot Also that fucking shitty battery life!
[0:16:53] <coreybom> @solswagguy56 I don't know. I mean, I guess I love them CAUSE I grew up with DmC, and I like the realistic look. Course, that's the just.
[0:16:56] <DatAsuna> Uncharted, ironically
[0:17:01] <Solidnick18> sly is pretty good
[0:17:02] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @BallerSwagBro9k
[0:17:04] <+Valask> 3 too
[0:17:06] <MyNameIsRasus> @solswagguy56 i play mostly RPGs so maybe that's it lol
[0:17:08] <pirateofpie> Dante can't even afford to pay any of his bills. He probably sold all his good clothes for more pizza money
[0:17:13] <SomersaultJustice> wasn't Mario Sunshine a giant vacation?
[0:17:15] <%Irridium> okay but for real though how come the switch pro controller with its HD rumble and motion controls can last what feels like god damn months but the PS4 controller runs out of batteries in like 3 hours
[0:17:17] <+firmlygraspi1> you mean 1 2 and 3?
[0:17:25] <@Solidus_113> S-Link Vacations
[0:17:26] <MyNameIsRasus> 4 and 5 are interludes
[0:17:34] <devil_may_cum_> Except for golden
[0:17:35] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Neighbors from Hell on vacation
[0:17:38] <devil_may_cum_> With the Marie shit
[0:17:57] <$connos_procrastination> hello guys wonder how many war crimes mihn is gonna advocate for today?
[0:17:58] <coreybom> @solswagguy56 Also, for the more realistic style, it'll be kinda weird if they had those larger then life outfits. Virgil notwithstanding.
[0:18:00] <SolSwagGuy56> Man I am hype for where Persona 5 in general. With Scramble and Royal
[0:18:04] <Prevot> Sunshine was a vacation that turned into the worst Mario game
[0:18:04] <$connos_procrastination> LUL
[0:18:12] <MyNameIsRasus> reminder that p5r is not a hustle, it's a scam

[0:18:34] <SolSwagGuy56> @coreybom I mean the whole legacy was built on being larger then life and anime as fuck... I kinda hate how they're low key ashamed of their roots

[0:19:24] <%wydamn> hello, sniper buddy
[0:19:31] <alrobot2014> might just be my headset

[0:20:29] <Mothman742> @solswagguy56 not yet but SOON
[0:20:30] <+ItsRatman> is that a freedom ghost?
[0:20:31] <%gatorafan> reminder, only Reggie is reading the chat but all three of them are going blind, so let's try to keep the game story to ourselves
[0:20:41] <SolSwagGuy56> @Solidus_113 Yes dis gon be goooooood
[0:20:41] <+gustavozxd> is there a chance he'll beat it today?
[0:20:47] <HouTheGaardian> Some of those loading screen tips have some real gems
[0:21:00] <ScreamLord> Did Woolie get to THAT scene yet? The Oh Shit Scene?
[0:21:05] <MyNameIsRasus> FFXV comes to mind
[0:21:12] <+Piemen99> Did woolie ever play outer wilds?
[0:21:15] <+ItsRatman> @ScreamLord we should be getting to it today
[0:21:20] <SolSwagGuy56> I wish one of the loading screens was just "Fuck you. No seriously just duck you"
[0:21:22] <VidulaSaix> Chat please stop asking spoilery questions FailFish
[0:21:23] <@Solidus_113> @Piemen99 there's a video on the channel

[0:21:27] <+Valask> i dont want to overhype anything. how much do they know?
[0:21:32] <MyNameIsRasus> @piemen99 didn't finish it tho
[0:21:35] <devil_may_cum_> This game is honestly fantastic, I love it
[0:21:38] <+fizzguy47> nier

[0:22:13] <+gustavozxd> FFXV one is REALLY good
[0:22:23] <Prevot> MHWorld unlocks a new title screen for each area as you unlock them and then picks a random one each time
[0:22:29] <%DesertPenguin> This would be a great game for a Remaster just to give it quality of life upgrades
[0:22:31] <coreybom> @solswagguy56 I don't buy they were ashamed of their roots. They had a SHIT ton of callbacks and the like. I just think they went for the looks for the hyper realistic art style. Hell, Dante still goes in as the Wahoo pizza hobo man we love.
[0:22:32] <damascussteele> !MOTIVATED

[0:23:03] <MyNameIsRasus> it's honestly amazing how FFXV goes from an 8 to a 2 right back to an 8 in the last third
[0:23:18] <+gustavozxd> yeah LUL
[0:23:21] <@Solidus_113> yeah audio is low
[0:23:24] <VidulaSaix> Game is extremely quiet
[0:23:24] <SolSwagGuy56> @coreybom True but there's also the "let's scrub the anime out of it". Guess it's less being ashamed of their roots and their western fetish/love of DmC
[0:23:24] <algi80> audio low
[0:23:32] <+gustavozxd> game audio looow
[0:23:33] <Solidnick18> little bit louder
[0:23:34] <coreybom> OH FUCK CHAPTER 8.
[0:23:34] <%Exiliator> real low
[0:23:35] <MyNameIsRasus> audio needs bump
[0:23:44] <ovan20> game audio is so low
[0:23:48] <+ConLin_Arts_> sbfpYeyeye sbfpYeyeye sbfpYeyeye

[0:50:22] <ShlickityShlim> I sleep ResidentSleeper
[0:50:22] <+theAncopro> "the more time alseep the less time I think"
[0:50:23] <%Irridium> damn
[0:50:24] <deviljhojho_> just sleep it off bro 4Head
[0:50:25] <+Piemen99> talking about war crimes
[0:50:28] <%Louie_Salmon> There's a certain nobility in lying in bed and pretending things aren't the way they are
[0:50:29] <+StooEsq> If you listen close, you can actually hear Woolie's suffering
[0:50:29] <fist_wizard_jay> the squadmate AI is killing Woolie
[0:50:29] <devil_may_cum_> Bruh what is happening
[0:50:31] <MyNameIsRasus> We should drop this conversation like it's white phosphorus hot
[0:50:31] <+firmlygraspi1> when im depressed i just spend more money on gatcha
[0:50:33] <Prevot> FeelsBadMan
[0:50:33] <devil_may_cum_> But I feel that tho
[0:50:35] <+gustavozxd> calebYikes calebYikes calebYikes calebYikes calebYikes calebYikes calebYikes calebYikes calebYikes calebYikes
[0:50:36] <+Qsmash_> get me outta here
[0:50:44] <deviljhojho_> This is the content i wanted
[0:50:48] <%gatorafan> WAKE ME UP
[0:50:48] <+LTKonnor> If I sleep, the war crimes didn't happen
[0:50:51] <segbas2004> someone should get Minh checked 24/7, this conversation is scary O.o
[0:50:52] <devil_may_cum_> This is getting wild
[0:50:55] <StandStab> @firmlygraspi1 literally me
[0:50:56] <+tuchpi> just sleep 4Head
[0:50:58] <dukenux> Woolie vs War Crimes [For Glory]
[0:51:03] <deviljhojho_> i schleep
[0:51:04] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Walker is louder than Woolie LUL
[0:51:04] <$connos_procrastination> if i were a soldierman i would simply not commit war crimes
[0:51:06] <Prevot> the discussion will never go away, just like the flames on those innocent civilians' bodies
[0:51:08] <+jiggy_snipe> only check on Minh if he's sleeping too much
[0:51:09] <SolSwagGuy56> Sometimes I exercise to forget that i white phosphorused civillians
[0:51:11] <%ElectricEmissary> no but Minh does describe a common avoidance method. sleeping in excessive amounts is associated with depression
[0:51:13] <Morning_Asakura> that is a scary mentality minh
[0:51:16] <%Exiliator> Some signs of depression is literally sleeping the days away
[0:51:21] <NoirMouse> G O T T H E F U C K E R
[0:51:22] <+gustavozxd> sleeping helps you get your emotions checked for the moment but it will come back if unchecked, I know from experience
[0:51:37] <%ElectricEmissary> it's an avoidance tactic
[0:51:38] <+firmlygraspi1> all that matters now is the PUSH
[0:51:46] <SolSwagGuy56> Bruh why doesn't Walker just take a nap fam. Just sleep it away
[0:51:47] <damascussteele> acheivement unlocked: let it snow
[0:51:50] <+Qsmash_> nice nade
[0:51:50] <%Exiliator> LUL
[0:51:54] <EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> LOL
[0:51:56] <MayorRev> that was scary
[0:51:58] <rubbishbinge> Try white phosphorus, it'll clear them out fairly quickly
[0:51:58] <+firmlygraspi1> IM BOUTA HIT THE BOOF
[0:52:12] <Liquirill> war is a crime. "war crime" is just a clever way of trick of implying "war is okay".
[0:52:18] <%gatorafan> ahhhhh, silence woolieMIRIN
[0:52:21] <Prevot> when you start using the white phosphorus it should say Easy Mode Unlocked
[0:52:28] <NoirMouse> White phosphorus clearly worked the first time
[0:52:31] <%razielhex> "War crimes" are for people who lose
[0:52:34] <StandStab> this white phosphorous I keep hearing about sounds pretty effective
[0:52:39] <+ItsRatman> you already used WP, may as well keep on using it :)
[0:52:45] <fist_wizard_jay> casually launches a rocket at infantry lol
[0:52:47] <SolSwagGuy56> Why are we even storming this gate again lol
[0:52:49] <+firmlygraspi1> @Liquirill oh no you killed someone without a higher rank's permission, that makes it murder!
[0:52:55] <segbas2004> I don't miss the brown filter era...
[0:52:57] <MayorRev> D:
[0:52:57] <+tuchpi> ???
[0:53:00] <Ser_Randal> BLIND
[0:53:04] <+jiggy_snipe> I mean, you're already in hell, might as well be the devil
[0:53:04] <+tuchpi> does he not see them getting shot?
[0:53:07] <@Solidus_113> look at the bullet trails
[0:53:07] <+ItsRatman> You could have looked at the tracers....
[0:53:13] <MyNameIsRasus> imma be that guy and say that the white phosphorus moment is robbed of most of its intended gravitas because you don't actually have a choice as a player
[0:53:16] <Liquirill> @firmlygraspi1 b-but it was just a whoopsie
[0:53:17] <Prevot> @Liquirill sshhhh just move along soldier
[0:53:25] <MayorRev> when was this made again
[0:53:31] <%razielhex> good checkpoint
[0:53:32] <NoirMouse> @MyNameIsRasus That's the point though
[0:53:36] <Morning_Asakura> @mynameisrasus that's the point tbh
[0:53:47] <SolSwagGuy56> BRING THEM FREEDOM WOOLIE
[0:53:51] <StandStab> @mynameisrasus that is literally the point
[0:53:56] <Yaganel> !uptime
[0:53:57] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 53 minutes and 59 seconds
[0:54:02] <%razielhex> @MyNameIsRasus The illusion of choice is itself the point of the scene.
[0:54:07] <SolSwagGuy56> Dat Aim :D
[0:54:10] <+firmlygraspi1> @Liquirill a wittle fuckie wuckie
[0:54:11] <MyNameIsRasus> i see
[0:54:14] <MayorRev> wheee
[0:54:18] <ShlickityShlim> Sam Gideon
[0:54:40] <NoirMouse> Ugh, I want to spoil the game to explain why
[0:54:44] <thetrashman_sc> @MyNameIsRasus the writer is aware of that but the amount of differences in the story that wouldve had to be made were too great
[0:54:44] <SolSwagGuy56> Some people can literally not handle a game making them feel bad
[0:54:45] <NoirMouse> But yes, that is the point
[0:54:46] <Morning_Asakura> but i do agree some kind of choice could've been interesting
[0:54:48] <MayorRev> assigning commands to your squad is neat
[0:54:51] <deviljhojho_> man i love it when people play spec ops. makes them act all weird
[0:55:02] <%razielhex> They're yelling hard enough
[0:55:03] <%razielhex> !uptime
[0:55:03] <NoirMouse> The only choice in this game you have is to stop playing
[0:55:05] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 55 minutes and 6 seconds
[0:55:10] <MayorRev> far too often AI teammates are either too strong or too stupid
[0:55:12] <SolSwagGuy56> Why doesn't Mario let me take a alternate path? MAybe Diplomacy?
[0:55:14] <%razielhex> Okay, so we're not yet to Radioman, huh?
[0:55:18] <Yaganel> How goes it Jho
[0:55:23] <+Huderga> Warcrimes Madden
[0:55:23] <+firmlygraspi1> this game is kinda like The Stanley Parable, but more BROWN
[0:55:34] <+gustavozxd> atpCarl
[0:55:40] <MayorRev> scope PogChamp
[0:55:44] <yourliteraldog> It basically is but with morewar crimes
[0:55:48] <NoirMouse> @firmlygraspi1 The Stanley Parable with guns
[0:55:51] <SolSwagGuy56> We did it!
[0:55:51] <%razielhex> @firmlygraspi1 But the ending is canonically saving the baby
[0:55:55] <%Exiliator> They should have made the "optional path" just really really hard, nudging the player to take the "easy way" by doing horrible shit
[0:55:55] <terribleusername> Good.
[0:55:58] <MayorRev> why'd he say that so ominously
[0:55:59] <+jiggy_snipe> Good
[0:56:02] <Solidnick18> good crimes
[0:56:03] <SolSwagGuy56> Good
[0:56:07] <MayorRev> monkaS
[0:56:26] <%razielhex> UMP45 is a good gun my man, .45 calibre SMG
[0:56:34] <+Valask> people talking about stopping playing the game. that makes sense on paper, when you're just watching it, but an average person that paid for this wouldn't just "stop" playing, so I don't buy it as an option the game is really giving you
[0:56:38] <+StooEsq> Your hand was forced by the devs
[0:56:42] <+firmlygraspi1> 4 DIMENSIONAL WAR CRIME CHESS
[0:56:46] <zamzoph> NO
[0:56:46] <DatAsuna> It's Walking Dead Season 1 problem
[0:56:46] <+gustavozxd> uh oh
[0:56:48] <%Exiliator> LUL
[0:56:49] <ShlickityShlim> It cant be helped
[0:56:50] <%Ecchigun> heya boys
[0:56:52] <buffmurffy> @Valask yeah, that's the point
[0:56:54] <+gustavozxd> atpRtsd4 atpRtsd4 atpRtsd4 atpRtsd4
[0:57:03] <SolSwagGuy56> Why don't games just Give me ABOSOLUTE FREEDOM MonkaS
[0:57:04] <Medo3G> pause menu says if there's inteil IIRC
[0:57:07] <thetrashman_sc> again they tried to write choices but they didnt have enough time to write a whole story for you not doing it
[0:57:09] <fist_wizard_jay> big war crime
[0:57:10] <+MrRabbles> "good guys' "bad guys"
[0:57:10] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:57:11] <buffmurffy> @Valask you bought a murder simulator, here you go
[0:57:23] <NoirMouse> This is a game to be experienced rather than watched
[0:57:24] <+jiggy_snipe> didn't the 33rd try to kill you?
[0:57:26] <NoirMouse> That's why
[0:57:32] <Prevot> why stop at blaming the player, I blame the devs for making the game in the first place LUL
[0:57:40] <SolSwagGuy56> @jiggy_snipe We shot first I think
[0:57:49] <MayorRev> i'm kinda mad that these guys went into a warzone with NO HELMETS
[0:57:57] <Prevot> ^
[0:57:57] <thetrashman_sc> the devs are like yeah we had a part in this too
[0:58:02] <%Exiliator> That door looked like it went the other way...
[0:58:10] <%razielhex> Okay, so next stop is RADIOMAN
[0:58:13] <NoirMouse> Yeah, the devs already said they're as much to blame
[0:58:13] <thealientrilogy> Nah, the point is the illusion of choice in most instances. Although you do have choices sometimes. Just like most generic FPS' this uses the tropes to do something completely new.
[0:58:13] <segbas2004> oh yeah playing the game is way more effective for what happened next.
[0:58:14] <%razielhex> and then it gets INTERESTING
[0:58:14] <MyNameIsRasus> @solswagguy56 the game gives you an objective, you do it and then it tells you you're a horrible person for doing it. that's stupid
[0:58:15] <zamzoph> monkaS
[0:58:17] <MayorRev> monkaS
[0:58:19] <@Solidus_113> crispy
[0:58:48] <Prevot> bacon for days
[0:58:54] <SolSwagGuy56> @MyNameIsRasus No that's the point. The game wants you to see what walker did. It's a story. If you don't like games not making you feel great maybe pick a different game?
[0:58:57] <%razielhex> @MyNameIsRasus Some objectives are false.
[0:59:04] <linklol321> Sup Konrad
[0:59:16] <thealientrilogy> It's really not stupid at all. Because it's not just criticising you for your choices in this game.
[0:59:21] <deadbrainpl> @MyNameIsRasus The game actually just wants you to think about why you're playing a violent power fantasy, remember it's deconstructing a VERY specific genre of games
[0:59:23] <thetrashman_sc> Konrad PogChamp
[0:59:28] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> oh look its Konrad monkaS
[0:59:29] <%razielhex> Also, not everything you see and hear is actually happening in the game.
[0:59:34] <+yoshiunity> There's no way around it. The only way to avoid it is to "STOP". Turn the game off, as the game is pleading with you to do.
[0:59:34] <+firmlygraspi1> Sonic Adventure 2 voice clipping LUL
[0:59:34] <zamzoph> Konrad SeemsGood
[0:59:38] <SolSwagGuy56> No but MEAN GAME CALL ME DUMB BibleThump
[0:59:44] <thetrashman_sc> DESCEND
[0:59:46] <%razielhex> WELCOME TO DUBAI
[0:59:47] <Prevot> kojima WISHES he could be as artsy fartsy as "just stop playing bro"
[0:59:47] <NoirMouse> Yeah, the entire game is Walker's story. The reason why you don't make choices is because he chooses not to
[0:59:48] <%razielhex> WE DID IT BOYS
[0:59:48] <+admiral_of_crunch> @razielhex Shh
[0:59:49] <MayorRev> i love how he just sticks it on his back
[1:00:02] <VidulaSaix> OBEY

[1:00:21] <linklol321> Oh shit, now we gon spend some time in here
[1:00:22] <Liquirill> "everything is teetering on the edge of everything" not sure if deep thought or mad drivel CarlSmile
[1:00:24] <graycat5> they didn't catch it
[1:00:25] <SolSwagGuy56> And we saved lives too :D
[1:00:26] <NoirMouse> Anyone noticed the hanging body in the reflection of the glass?
[1:00:27] <Solidnick18> goddamn
[1:00:31] <MayorRev> oooh
[1:00:33] <%razielhex> Here we go! The UNDERPASS
[1:00:36] <BallerSwagBro9k> This is where the gmae gets good
[1:00:36] <MayorRev> nice sceneery
[1:00:37] <thetrashman_sc> @NoirMouse monkaS
[1:00:38] <%razielhex> Been waiting a week for this
[1:00:44] <%razielhex> "THE CHOICE"
[1:00:46] <devil_may_cum_> Oh shit
[1:00:48] <%Louie_Salmon> I actually hate all discussion around "games with choices". The point is not to present you with a good and a bad and pat you on the head for picking the objectively right one. The point is that you're placed in intense situations and pressured by UI to do the wrong thing, so you can empathize with that kind of situation
[1:00:50] <%kyh9> RAID, SHADOW LEGENDS
[1:00:52] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Flash
[1:00:53] <+yoshiunity> Yeah... "Konrad" did it...
[1:00:54] <+firmlygraspi1> OH MY GOD COKE
[1:00:55] <+Valask> @liquirill sounds like something Conrad would write honestly
[1:00:55] <Medo3G> emote mode?
[1:00:58] <MayorRev> RAID
[1:00:59] <+tuchpi> the boys
[1:00:59] <SolSwagGuy56> BLUE APRON
[1:00:59] <BallerSwagBro9k> THE BOYS
[1:01:03] <deadbrainpl> @Liquirill it's actually a quote from a poem I think
[1:01:06] <BallerSwagBro9k> Its really good
[1:01:06] <SolSwagGuy56> Oh shit
[1:01:07] <MyNameIsRasus> @solswagguy56 it's not about what i like to feel like, I'm saying that a forced choice just isn't as strong in conveying a message as a genuine one made by the player.
[1:01:09] <@Solidus_113> The Boys is a good show
[1:01:09] <MayorRev> monkaS

[1:01:29] <Liquirill> @Valask is Conrad the game's story writer?
[1:01:30] <%Lion_kun> Come at me.
[1:01:32] <%JetpackMcQuack> JetpackMcQuack subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[1:01:35] <deviljhojho_> oof
[1:01:50] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> monkaS
[1:01:52] <Liquirill> @deadbrainpl oh interesting
[1:01:55] <Prevot> I only watched the first episode, never got around to watching the rest
[1:01:58] <SolSwagGuy56> @MyNameIsRasus No offense but "A message made by the player" is near gibberish. All games a a degree of linearity. And this uses it's to tell it's story
[1:02:00] <deviljhojho_> wacky walker at it again
[1:02:02] <+MrAtheGreat> WHOSE WORSE
[1:02:06] <+firmlygraspi1> kill them both, they have money!

[1:03:57] <+yoshiunity> Best option in a shitty situation.
[1:03:58] <+Whens_Marbles> @WoolieVersus It's the radio on his back.
[1:04:00] <yourliteraldog> trolly problem

[1:04:38] <SolSwagGuy56> @razielhex This game is kinda tough
[1:04:38] <$Nettacki> Playing this on PS3? 🤔
[1:04:51] <MyNameIsRasus> @solswagguy56 a CHOICE made by the player, not a message. Games can present you with a choice, and give you consequences based on your actions. However, if it forces your hand, than the consequences are not as strongly conveyed if compared to a situation in which the player actively chose to do something and had the option to not do it.
[1:05:02] <linklol321> Oh, konrad doesnt say the line if you dont do what he says
[1:05:02] <MayorRev> jesus

[1:19:21] <%Irridium> nice little detail is that as the game goes on your call-outs get less and less "professional". Same with the executions too, they progressively get more brutal

[1:20:31] <+liquidzr0> that wasn't a frag
[1:20:33] <ReelDeath> the spice must flow
[1:20:34] <+Risingxiv> He said frag?
[1:20:41] <Melabeez> flash frag
[1:20:48] <+jiggy_snipe> I like Riggs

[1:20:53] <derap41> so where we at?
[1:20:54] <%Exiliator> Was it a JUKE?
[1:21:03] <SolSwagGuy56> Yeah fuck Konrad we gotta take that dude down

[1:21:16] <derap41> Apocalypse now anyone?
[1:21:17] <jorniev> go and kill konrad woolie!
[1:21:23] <+liquidzr0> gwdYsh ah I see
[1:21:32] <Lionkevinson> White phosphorus?
[1:21:43] <derap41> In War one must make a firend of Horror
[1:21:53] <Halospaz117> PUT HIM- sounds like a plan
[1:21:54] <SolSwagGuy56> My coping mechanism is White POsphorus
[1:22:15] <jorniev> i think he already white phosporated the shit out of those people
[1:22:27] <SolSwagGuy56> I like the lighting of this part of the game
[1:22:29] <+Valask> ok this game's sound track is actually fantastic
[1:22:35] <Prevot> that phosphorus was SO WHITE
[1:22:45] <jorniev> man the art direction in this game is great
[1:22:48] <NoirMouse> Yeah the game's visual and audio are so good
[1:22:48] <%Exiliator> SO WHITE
[1:22:49] <SolSwagGuy56> I think this game gets a bad rep on it's color pallette I think it does prettty good
[1:22:54] <jorniev> SO WHITE
[1:22:57] <thetrashman_sc> cmonBruh so white?
[1:23:05] <Melabeez> soldiers are forced to do things in like any country because they are... soldiers
[1:23:05] <+jiggy_snipe> the music really makes the color palette work
[1:23:10] <+liquidzr0> gwdSla
[1:23:11] <%Louie_Salmon> I know critiquing LP gameplay is dumb but why does Woolie point his allies at a target and then shoot that same target
[1:23:15] <Rakharian> the color palette is on point for what it¨s trying to accomplish
[1:23:26] <Mothman742> yo any black phosphoruses in chat? woolieMIRIN
[1:23:28] <SolSwagGuy56> @Louie_Salmon For the mix up
[1:23:44] <+Valask> charisma is a really reductive explanation to what happened in Germany pre ww2
[1:23:50] <jorniev> notice how the music is no longer diegetic?
[1:23:52] <yourliteraldog> Yeah
[1:23:52] <+spacehouse> aw, not at maximum growly yet
[1:23:55] <MayorRev> i dont think the silencers are helping them much here
[1:23:57] <rumuloh> The evolution of your command barks through the game is one of my favorite parts of this game
[1:23:59] <deadbrainpl> @Mothman742 Black phosphorous actually exists
[1:24:09] <%Louie_Salmon> @solswagguy56 Ah, they can't block him and the assist at the same time, I see

[2:31:33] <Solidnick18> SourPls
[2:31:33] <+MrAtheGreat> Also, this was the game that invented ammo on excecution, not doom

[2:31:55] <jorniev> by now i think woolie killed the guy in the main menu

[2:32:14] <wanocountry> !Uptime

[2:32:28] <derap41> Funny you should say
[2:32:32] <+Toblo1> Ah man I'm feeling the Double
[2:32:32] <%DesertPenguin> @Razielhex the entire game is a better adaptation of the novel Heart of Darkness that Apocalypse Now is also based off of
[2:32:35] <%razielhex> @dukenux No, Apocalypse Now
[2:32:37] <+jiggy_snipe> the music is messing up I think
[2:32:40] <+MrAtheGreat> @admiral_of_crunch LUL idk exactly but I can't think of another
[2:32:44] <%DesertPenguin> This is just a better APocalypse Now
[2:32:46] <HeroToxiko> i feel like the antiwar videogames of the naughties would have been more acclaimed if they werent so buggy on launch
[2:32:46] <dukenux> Well, this game is a homage to Apocalypse Now among other things
[2:32:47] <+firmlygraspi1> melee kill was worth the six bullets in the ribs
[2:32:48] <ha2ken> I need you to focus on the - *punch*
[2:32:51] <BallerSwagBro9k> This is a very Tarantino moment
[2:32:55] <%DesertPenguin> It's not an homage, it's a better version lol
[2:32:58] <dukenux> @razielhex he was in that? damn, i completely forgot
[2:32:59] <derap41> Focus your fire on the tango with the red triangle
[2:33:00] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:33:01] <jorniev> remember to melee woolie
[2:33:03] <coracor> it's not messing up, you're hearing it out of multiple unsynced speakers
[2:33:04] <%razielhex> @DesertPenguin It's a modern recontextualizing within the frame of GWOT.
[2:33:09] <%DesertPenguin> Exactly
[2:33:10] <+tuchpi> ah yes, SODA
[2:33:19] <Bustahhwulf> would vendingmachines be stocked in a warzone notekBird
[2:33:21] <%DesertPenguin> The end of this game is better than the end of the movie though
[2:33:27] <OldManDeckardCain> FILTER YOUR PISS SOLDIER
[2:33:31] <+ItsRatman> I'm genuinely impressed how many different contextual call outs walker has
[2:33:32] <MyNameIsRasus> soda also isn't a very good source of hydration

[2:33:57] <+QueequegTheater> Alright I'm back, what I miss
[2:34:03] <HeroToxiko> Who is playing that music?
[2:34:03] <%DesertPenguin> Shooty bang bangs
[2:34:07] <alrobot2014> we killed title screen boy
[2:34:09] <Ropcord> war crimes
[2:34:11] <Halospaz117> Radioman is playing the music
[2:34:12] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> big murders
[2:34:15] <BallerSwagBro9k> It super is
[2:34:16] <gordieda20> LUL
[2:34:18] <%razielhex> But even, say, the memoirs of Anthony Swofford ("JARHEAD") in Desert Storm, it was notied that GenX and Millenials entering GWOT often borrowed the musical identity of Vietnam rather than forge their own.
[2:34:20] <+QueequegTheater> @alrobot2014 BibleThump 7

[2:50:21] <dukenux> *stabs Addams with a syringe* YOU'RE FINE
[2:50:27] <i_heart_gaming> The AI on your partners is really good in this game. They actually do damage
[2:50:29] <deadbrainpl> The devs didn't even want the multiplayer and made it clear many times, they even disabled achivements in it
[2:50:34] <CursedNobleman> Squid1 Squid3 Squid4
[2:50:37] <+MrAtheGreat> Up top
[2:50:44] <HeroToxiko> there was multiplayer? i remember seeing news of a patch but was long gone
[2:50:52] <$Tredecian> wacky wavy inflatable arm man
[2:50:53] <+theAncopro> im pretty sure the multiplayer was outsourced as well
[2:51:00] <SolSwagGuy56> Right here you diefd
[2:51:03] <biggdaddymike> There is multiplayer but the developers didn't want to do it
[2:51:08] <biggdaddymike> 2k forced them
[2:51:09] <i_heart_gaming> They didnt want multiplayer. They were forced to implement it.
[2:51:12] <KeystoneA1> Multiplayer got hamfisted in the game to the protest of the devs
[2:51:13] <Nomad94> Yep
[2:51:15] <+chubbypencil> Oh I'm not defending it being in the game, i just remember not hating the couple of hours it put into it
[2:51:18] <dukenux> Notice that HUGE fuel tank
[2:51:21] <SolSwagGuy56> SAVED
[2:51:23] <derap41> Saved yuor ass
[2:51:25] <+MrAtheGreat> Thx LUGO
[2:51:26] <%Irridium> from what I remember if the devs wanted the single player to be the way it is they had to do the multiplayer.
[2:51:28] <+ItsRatman> YOU'RE WELCOME
[2:51:29] <SolSwagGuy56> DIE LUGO
[2:51:33] <+QueequegTheater> @HeroToxiko Yeah, and the devs were forced by 2K to include it. One dev described it as "the game mechanics were raped to make it happen"
[2:51:35] <deadbrainpl> Yeah it was deeeecent but it was tacked on
[2:51:36] <CrabSlacks> thank you, lugo
[2:51:37] <derap41> Lugo saved they day once again

[3:52:27] <Ultimatefool> Reggie, does your beard get scraggly/messy? Mine does if I just let it grow out, usually just end up shaving all of it
[3:52:27] <Halospaz117> Oh fuck no it ain't
[3:52:29] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> BINARY DOMAIN PogChamp
[3:52:30] <biggdaddymike> Warhammer 40 Spacemarine
[3:52:31] <dukenux> Next week: Woolie plays DOOM
[3:52:32] <rumblebunni> I will vote for Space Marine as well.
[3:52:32] <%Irridium> Medal of Honor: Doorfighter
[3:52:33] <derap41> Nah Woolie is now playing FPS 24/7
[3:52:33] <biggdaddymike> SPACEMARINE
[3:52:35] <+zanzibar_junker> did they finish?
[3:52:35] <hntronium> The Space Marine story is so amazing and you should get into it
[3:52:38] <jorniev> TITANFALL 3 LP
[3:52:39] <bingobangoboingobongo> space marine Kreygasm
[3:52:40] <%gatorafan> Get into shooters :)
[3:52:40] <%Louie_Salmon> Call of Duty 4 is way up there
[3:52:42] <hntronium> There are radios, bad guys and demons
[3:52:43] <devil_may_cum_> Wish there were more shooters like this
[3:52:47] <petwisk> so play DOOM ETERNAL
[3:52:49] <dukenux> Woolie vs. GOW series(the shooty one)
[3:52:51] <+admiral_of_crunch> Play the shooters that aren't self-aware
[3:52:54] <dukenux> blind spots suck
[3:52:57] <devil_may_cum_> COD4 is great tho
[3:52:58] <dukenux> have them too
[3:52:58] <DatAsuna> He should play Republic Commando tho, it has better squad commands and the soudntrack has mandalorians doing hakas
[3:52:59] <HeroToxiko> those suck
[3:53:03] <+yoshiunity> Do you guys feel heroes, yet?
[3:53:04] <pirateofpie> Vanquish tho...
[3:53:06] <+RealThiele> sponsored by shave butter
[3:53:07] <Halospaz117> OH GOD I KNOW THAT FEELING
[3:53:10] <derap41> Think the only comparable game to this is undertale really
[3:53:14] <thealientrilogy> If you play any other game of thiis type it ought to be CHAOS THEORY or OG Xbox DOUBLE AGENT or REPUBLIC COMMANDO
[3:53:17] <jorniev> no republic comando is too dated dude
[3:53:20] <dukenux> Vanquish is *Platinum brand shooter tho
[3:53:26] <+undercoverbarber> That make me cool too atpGasm
[3:53:32] <+tuchpi> LUL
[3:53:37] <SolSwagGuy56> Republic Commando is kinda dated
[3:53:37] <Halospaz117> Republic Commando is a Star Wars
[3:53:38] <Waage83> Dood Republic Commando is the shit.
[3:53:40] <%Irridium> Nah Republic Commando's still pretty sweet
[3:53:40] <hntronium> Republic Commando is rad
[3:53:40] <dukenux> Republic Commando is also nothing like those
[3:53:41] <jorniev> just play trough revengeance
[3:53:41] <DatAsuna> Republic Commando is god tier music
[3:53:42] <%Exiliator> Imagine a alternate reality were Woolie's big thing was shooters instead of fighting games? When's QUAKE!? LUL
[3:53:43] <dukenux> but it's good
[3:53:47] <DatAsuna> It is dated but
[3:53:48] <+RealThiele> jedi academy
[3:53:48] <i_heart_gaming> Resistance? or actually did anybody even play resistance?
[3:53:48] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @htt0r1hnz0
[3:53:49] <+Javaa01> Republic Commando is still fine, on PC at least
[3:53:53] <Reizie_Etherealm> Splinter Cell? Suggested to Woolie? Are you out of your mind?
[3:53:54] <+ConLin_Arts_> Is there any games you guys really would want to play with Woolie on Stream?
[3:53:55] <+htt0r1hnz0> sorry
[3:53:58] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> ARMY OF TWO
[3:53:58] <DatAsuna> there have been no better squad command shooters since it
[3:53:59] <Halospaz117> Republic Commando is a star wars game and it's rad as fuck
[3:53:59] <%gatorafan> Woolie VS Starcraft when? :)
[3:54:00] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> COOP
[3:54:00] <Waage83> Republic Commando is not to long and is a good Star Wars game
[3:54:03] <+QueequegTheater> 2 and 3 literally have the exact same ending as the first one
[3:54:04] <DedlokPM> SMOrc PLAY WH40k SPACE MARINE
[3:54:06] <+BionoidLCR> @i_heart_gaming the first was the only good one imo
[3:54:08] <DatAsuna> so while it's dated, nothing really updated it
[3:54:12] <xcompleasedad> Just came in. They finish it?
[3:54:14] <dukenux> Woolie vs. Quake Live FOR FUN(???)
[3:54:14] <SolSwagGuy56> WHENS FORTNITE
[3:54:14] <Rakharian> was there a talks about actually doing kotor 2 playthrough or am I crazy?
[3:54:19] <+htt0r1hnz0> @DedlokPM YES
[3:54:21] <+undercoverbarber> Army of two would be a good pick
[3:54:21] <+QueequegTheater> WHEN'S QUARK
[3:54:22] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Army of Two coop and watch insanity happen
[3:54:22] <Waage83> Fuck you SPACE MARINE! Would be awesome
[3:54:23] <+RealThiele> session done, game incomplete
[3:54:23] <i_heart_gaming> I loved the first resistance.
[3:54:27] <%Louie_Salmon> Oh wait, Doom should totally be the next shooter if there is one
[3:54:30] <zamzoph> Whatever happened to that Unreal hero shooter?
[3:54:35] <OldManDeckardCain> WHEN'S ENEMY TERRITORY
[3:54:35] <%valriot> Woolie should stream Doom 2016 and Doom Eternal though
[3:54:36] <xcompleasedad> @RealThiele They get to the thing?
[3:54:43] <+RealThiele> tower and lugo
[3:54:46] <%Exiliator> That was Woolie's setup
[3:54:49] <%Exiliator> right?
[3:54:49] <derap41> So Walker's has really just fucked the civilians chances of survival no transport nor water no communication but why would he do this?
[3:54:55] <+Javaa01> Just do it
[3:54:55] <SolSwagGuy56> Minh is allergic to keyboards
[3:54:59] <hntronium> Keyboard Commander
[3:55:00] <xcompleasedad> @valriot He might be bad enough to not enjoy it
[3:55:01] <Memdosu> Army of Two play through would be fun
[3:55:02] <derap41> Cause Konrad is a fuck
[3:55:02] <+RealThiele> and he saved all the civs
[3:55:03] <%biggdaddymike> biggdaddymike subscribed at Tier 1. 
[3:55:07] <thealientrilogy> Woolie Versus SPLINTER CELL, I am out of my mind to be completely fair.
[3:55:14] <SolSwagGuy56> @derap41 Cause he's a GOD DAMN SUPERHERO
[3:55:16] <+htt0r1hnz0> Cause he's super cool American Gi JOE hero!
[3:55:16] <+RealThiele> payday squad?
[3:55:21] <%gatorafan> yeyeyeyeye Woolie should stream Doom with that Frankenstein setup he has.
[3:55:24] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus Republic Commando has hakas tho
[3:55:30] <rumuloh> "FPS"
[3:55:38] <%biggdaddymike> Has Woolie ever played Prototype?
[3:55:39] <zamzoph> Has Woolie played Half Life 2?
[3:55:41] <dukenux> Stay hydrated
[3:55:42] <Memdosu> Republic Commando Haka ftw
[3:55:43] <+RealThiele> borderlands is an easy shooter as well

[3:55:46] <+MrAtheGreat> BLADDER : EMPTIED
[3:55:46] <dukenux> especially in Dubai

[3:56:07] <+MrRabbles> Prototype is the hottest mess
[3:56:07] <jorniev> VANQUISH
[3:56:08] <+undercoverbarber> Army of Two would be a good pick

[3:56:45] <+RealThiele> ME1 car missions are eugh
[3:56:48] <%Lion_kun> wait did they beat the game?
[3:57:00] <+DoctorDerp388> correct
[3:57:01] <%Lion_kun> i thought there was one mroe segment?
[3:57:05] <zamzoph> What scene?
[3:57:06] <+RealThiele> session left off at the tower after lugo ded
[3:57:06] <%Lion_kun> with the mirrors
[3:57:07] <dukenux> ???
[3:57:13] <alrobot2014> they haven't beaten the game yet
[3:57:13] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> LUL
[3:57:13] <+admiral_of_crunch> Walker doesn't give you any choice
[3:57:14] <DingusMcBaseball> @WoolieVersus play Mysterious Mod woolie, youd love it
[3:57:18] <TwinBat> apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin
[3:57:18] <alrobot2014> they just took a bit of a break
[3:57:18] <Halospaz117> Probably talking about the WP scene
[3:57:18] <+MrAtheGreat> Mind goblins rave
[3:57:20] <Psyramics> wait, which scene was this?
[3:57:21] <Vikken141> The war crime scene
[3:57:21] <Medo3G> white phosphorus
[3:57:21] <devil_may_cum_> What???
[3:57:23] <derap41> This is why you can't be aware of what the game is trying to do
[3:57:23] <+Javaa01> You can fight forever there, but you can't win without fucking up
[3:57:28] <hntronium> Talking about White Phosphorus?
[3:57:29] <+Razputin217> apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin
[3:57:34] <DatAsuna> Yeah WP
[3:57:34] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:57:34] <+MrAtheGreat> OOMPH OOMPH OOMPH
[3:57:35] <hntronium> Yeah you have to do it
[3:57:35] <%Lion_kun> the plot twist scene
[3:57:36] <+admiral_of_crunch> You straight up run out of ammo
[3:57:38] <dukenux> Oh the phosphorus? yeah you have no choice in this one
[3:57:39] <hntronium> That's why I hate it
[3:57:48] <DatAsuna> Fake choice
[3:57:49] <Nomad94> It's the point of the scene. Walker ain't getting past that part without warcrimes, and neither are you.
[3:57:49] <derap41> Woolie didn't shoot the crowd at least
[3:57:52] <Torgue_1> There are multiple endings, tho
[3:57:58] <KaseKaizer> LUL
[3:58:00] <jorniev> THERE IS NO CHOICE!
[3:58:04] <dukenux> Wait for the ending Reggie
[3:58:04] <+DoctorDerp388> ludonarrative dissonaaaaaaaaance atpCap
[3:58:05] <+MrAtheGreat> dmn straight
[3:58:05] <Prevot> LUL
[3:58:10] <devil_may_cum_> There are multiple endings tho
[3:58:16] <rumuloh> "There is always a choice" "No there fucking isn't" Is literally what the game tells you before you burn the civies @WoolieVersus
[3:58:17] <+RealThiele> walker looks like twoface he so fucked
[3:58:20] <Nomad94> let's not get into the multiple endings
[3:58:23] <Medo3G> this is a bad donation to read before the final bit
[3:58:40] <jorniev> its still a great narrative
[3:58:40] <+undercoverbarber> I make za bad game
[3:58:49] <zamzoph> Woolie let Lugo's killers go FeelsBadMan
[3:58:49] <%gatorafan> perfect run of war crimes
[3:58:51] <derap41> The point is that a person that plays fps game would just do it without caring about it because its just a game it won't turn on you
[3:58:52] <DatAsuna> They said there was multiple endings woolie just read the opposite I'm pretty sure
[3:58:52] <+MrRabbles> that's a line not for the player but for Walker the character
[3:58:53] <dukenux> Walker said that tho
[3:58:54] <RunningNGunning> The choice is to not play @WoolieVersus
[3:58:54] <+luigintbknss> Oh man they are getting played
[3:58:54] <%Louie_Salmon> Being forced into a choice can be just as valuable as actually having a choice. The point was that the character didn't see a way out, the way that is conveyed to you is there being literally no way out.
[3:58:55] <%ChoculaUltra> I love how Adams was seemingly the voice of reason till he saw what the refugees did to Lugo
[3:58:57] <%biggdaddymike> Walker said, no there really wasn't.
[3:58:58] <dukenux> and then he massacred civvies
[3:58:59] <+admiral_of_crunch> That specific scene shows what the game's intent is. It's not going after you, the player, for making the bad choice. It's going after you for engaging in the military shooter genre, but it's mostly going after Walker as an archetypal vidya shooter hero man.
[3:59:05] <Reizie_Etherealm> There's always a choice Walking Dead
[3:59:06] <+RealThiele> TELL THE RECRUITER TO FUCK OFF
[3:59:08] <+theAncopro> big boss eventually has to kill someone
[3:59:11] <devil_may_cum_> Followed by “no there fucking isn’t”
[3:59:13] <Nomad94> @WoolieVersus The devs also said quitting the game at that part is a perfectly valid choice
[3:59:23] <DatAsuna> You woulda done it if they were BTs
[3:59:24] <derap41> @admiral_of_crunch exactly
[3:59:27] <+DreyfussFrost> Grenades are more useful for hitting an area (or behind cover) than damage on one target. They're your shmup bombs, hoarded resources are wasted resources. They give you more regularly.
[3:59:33] <RunningNGunning> Quitting the game is a choice
[3:59:34] <BallerSwagBro9k> Nani he stopped? Hes so close to the end
[3:59:37] <SolSwagGuy56> Nya nya :3
[3:59:40] <+jiggy_snipe> In the moment, Woolie did question if they were civilians before he eventually found out
[3:59:42] <+admiral_of_crunch> The dissonance is intentional. Walker isn't giving the player a choice, not the game.
[3:59:42] <arkv01> ez breezy war crimes
[3:59:43] <+RealThiele> walker as a kid in a mall, make the decision to go to the food court instead
[3:59:44] <%The_Timo> Still a murderer
[3:59:44] <DatAsuna> @BallerSwagBro9k just a break
[3:59:46] <NotHereToStream> quit the game and refund is a great choice Kappa
[3:59:48] <Prevot> "just stop playing bro" is hilariously stupid
[3:59:55] <BallerSwagBro9k> Oh ok thanks :)
[3:59:56] <thealientrilogy> @admiral_of_crunch you nailed it
[4:00:00] <%biggdaddymike> The developers had planned on having an alternate path on the white phosphorus section but either due to their commitment to their story or constraints they decided not to
[4:00:11] <hntronium> Telling me to stop playing this game I paid for makes me say fuck the devs
[4:00:12] <jorniev> its not that stupid is just an option
[4:00:13] <alrobot2014> adams was to the left in that scene and told you to follow him
[4:00:14] <@Solidus_113> There was a humvee on a bridge above the civvies
[4:00:16] <Reizie_Etherealm> Has any game ever given you an achievement for not playing it?
[4:00:24] <%The_Timo> You also just decided both those guys should die at the underpass
[4:00:25] <+RealThiele> stanley parable
[4:00:27] <%Louie_Salmon> @reizie_etherealm Stanley Parable
[4:00:30] <+RealThiele> yeye
[4:00:33] <Medo3G> there was a choice there
[4:00:34] <+htt0r1hnz0> @biggdaddymike they said they couldn't make the rest of the game go where they wanted if the players don't do it
[4:00:41] <jorniev> the game also tells you that you are a good person
[4:00:47] <+Piemen99> wait they played Stanley?
[4:00:48] <Reizie_Etherealm> I forgot about that trip of a life time stanley
[4:00:53] <DatAsuna> Walker specifically said no choice
[4:01:00] <%Louie_Salmon> I don't think Woolie has ever played that, no
[4:01:02] <jorniev> play stanley parable
[4:01:08] <+RealThiele> stanley would be a good lp
[4:01:09] <+Piemen99> oh
[4:01:15] <%biggdaddymike> @htt0r1hnz0 Makes sense
[4:01:16] <+BlockingDisabled> You need to not play Stanley Parable for 5 years for an achivement
[4:01:18] <derap41> They didn't explain the crowd choice
[4:01:21] <DatAsuna> Didn't they do stanly parable on SBFP?
[4:01:27] <%Louie_Salmon> That would be perfect for a stream, it's like 2-3 hours to do everything
[4:01:34] <@Solidus_113> Waiting for Superliminal to come to PS4 for that LP
[4:01:34] <Medo3G> not always
[4:01:36] <jorniev> no they played the other game
[4:01:36] <+DreyfussFrost> That's not true at all! They didn't say a word about the choice with the civvies you literally just did.
[4:01:40] <Nomad94> @BlockingDisabled And play it for an entire Tuesday for another
[4:01:41] <BallerSwagBro9k> ITS ABOUT FAMILY
[4:01:51] <Psyramics> Press X to Be Evil
[4:01:52] <devil_may_cum_> It’s a story about family
[4:01:56] <Memdosu> Well also chat was yelling shoot the air lol
[4:01:59] <+RealThiele> SBFP played beginners guide
[4:02:02] <+undercoverbarber> Nani the fuck?
[4:02:03] <DatAsuna> Real talk black ops 2 has one of the best hidden choice scenes tbh
[4:02:07] <%valriot> Woolie killed that guy
[4:02:08] <dukenux> they should put it an option to "Just leave 4Head" with underwhelming cutscene and narration, to drive further that This. Is. Not. What the game. Is about.
[4:02:10] <CursedNobleman> are we finishing?
[4:02:11] <TigerClaws12> rotor sounds SourPls
[4:02:12] <Nomad94> Woolie did NOT shoot civies though!
[4:02:14] <%Exiliator> shoot the people!
[4:02:14] <dukenux> FROM MY POINT OF VIEW
[4:02:16] <derap41> They where American army woolie
[4:02:18] <+DreyfussFrost> There are tons of choices in this game that aren't telegraphed, just not the white phosphorous scene.
[4:02:18] <Prevot> they were
[4:02:19] <SheefEatsBeef> from my point of view the 33rd is evil
[4:02:20] <CursedNobleman> YESSSSSSSSS LUL
[4:02:20] <+jiggy_snipe> the 33rd was doing bad things
[4:02:20] <SolSwagGuy56> TIME TO BE A HERO
[4:02:22] <+RealThiele> the youndlings were evil
[4:02:23] <devil_may_cum_> Do you feel like a hero yet?
[4:02:24] <DatAsuna> You are like 95% of the way through
[4:02:33] <+admiral_of_crunch> Oh are we going to keep going?
[4:02:34] <+jiggy_snipe> remember you find alot of dead soldiers
[4:02:34] <Reizie_Etherealm> You can always compartmentalize and think that those people are gonna be fucked anyway even if you didn't fuck them up
[4:02:36] <%Louie_Salmon> And sometimes it's not about a choice, sometimes it's about what you do on impulse and reaction with minimal information
[4:02:37] <dukenux> @SheefEatsBeef Then you're already lost
[4:02:38] <+admiral_of_crunch> Fucking sick
[4:02:39] <+JamesCorck> Almost there!
[4:02:43] <Halospaz117> THEN YOU ARE LOST
[4:02:44] <Nomad94> This chapter also has BRUTAL parts though. It's not an easy finale.
[4:02:46] <+RealThiele> prequels will neva die
[4:02:49] <Robocopdood> LMAO
[4:02:50] <HeroToxiko> LUL
[4:02:53] <thealientrilogy> "But they were bad people." -Laura "Just people." -Logan
[4:02:56] <%ChoculaUltra> Only the 33rd deals in absolutes. I will do what I must.
[4:02:56] <+admiral_of_crunch> Finale bois
[4:02:58] <hntronium> DELTA FORCE HAS THE HIGH GROUND
[4:03:00] <SolSwagGuy56> Remember when it was recon
[4:03:01] <BallerSwagBro9k> I hate sand, its coarse and gets everywhere LUL
[4:03:03] <NotHereToStream> LUL
[4:03:10] <+jiggy_snipe> Delta Force was supposed to find survivors and report back Kappa
[4:03:10] <SolSwagGuy56> The CIA
[4:03:12] <+RealThiele> YOU UNDERESTIMATE MY WARCRIMES
[4:03:15] <%valriot> Man, the prequels being more memorable than the new trilogy is just poetry
[4:03:15] <dmysta3000> Walker killed younglings!
[4:03:16] <Darkmega97> We saw dead americans and decided to add more dead americans
[4:03:17] <17DeadFlamingos> I hate insurgents, they're coarse and they get everywhere
[4:03:18] <HeroToxiko> "They were animals and i killed them like animals"
[4:03:19] <+yoshiunity> BACK INTO HELL WE GO.
[4:03:22] <%ChoculaUltra> I hate white phosphorus. It hurts and gets everywhere.
[4:03:23] <Prevot> wollie killed not just the 33rd, but the CIA and the civilians too
[4:03:27] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> I KILLED THEM

[4:03:41] <Reizie_Etherealm> THE AMERICANS TOO
[4:03:43] <+htt0r1hnz0> Not JUST the men, but the WOMEN, and CHILDREN too
[4:03:44] <SolSwagGuy56> It was THE CIA
[4:03:45] <dukenux> @thealientrilogy i just bought LOGAN disc the other day. great movie
[4:03:46] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> He slaughtered them all like animals! Not and just the men, but the women, and children too!
[4:03:50] <+htt0r1hnz0> I HATE them!
[4:03:58] <coracor> the CIA rabbleroused an insurgency together
[4:03:58] <%ChoculaUltra> You were my brother, 33rd! I loved you.
[4:03:58] <+MrRabbles> ESPECIALLY THE CHILDREN
[4:04:05] <SolSwagGuy56> No it was the CIA vs the 33rd
[4:04:05] <thetrashman_sc> the cia
[4:04:10] <rumuloh> Yeah, they "Just started running marshal law" Look at the environment, it's literally a post apocalypse tier city

[4:04:14] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @yoshiunity
[4:04:18] <+RealThiele> have you ever heard of the tale of captain walker of crimes? its not a story an American soldier would tell you
[4:04:20] <%razielhex> It's always the CIA's faultr
[4:04:21] <derap41> There are 6 sides in this conflict
[4:04:23] <$ElCobraLazerFace> It was never a good thing, they all are imperialistic forces
[4:04:26] <Prevot> I just want someone to explain how many soldiers the 33rd had, cause that shit is RIDICC
[4:04:27] <Reizie_Etherealm> ESPECIALLY THE CHILDREN, THEY'RE DOWN WlTH THE DEVIL
[4:04:28] <arkv01> oh shit we finished the gamef today?

[4:04:54] <SolSwagGuy56> WHEN THE CIA
[4:04:56] <%Exiliator> The background reminds me of Brink
[4:04:59] <%ChoculaUltra> This was your father's M4. He wanted you to have it when you were older.
[4:04:59] <HeroToxiko> Stormwall?
[4:05:00] <BallerSwagBro9k> Did Woolz shoot Lugos killers?
[4:05:04] <%Exiliator> I dont want to be reminded of Brink
[4:05:07] <+ConLin_Arts_> he scared them
[4:05:11] <$ElCobraLazerFace> Nothing says "help with a natural disaster" than sending an entire army of people along with the CIA
[4:05:13] <+MrAtheGreat> @BallerSwagBro9k Nope
[4:05:14] <gunsrlove> You are still a good person
[4:05:15] <+jiggy_snipe> no he shot in the air

[4:05:20] <derap41> So this is 3 days no sleep right now
[4:05:25] <+RealThiele> kill everything that moves except the lugo killers

[4:05:40] <+htt0r1hnz0> @derap41 No water and food either
[4:05:45] <+admiral_of_crunch> The entire 33rd is against you SPECIFICALLY now
[4:05:50] <rumuloh> I don't think woolie can see the nuance between "rulling over" and "Enforcing order in a crisis"
[4:05:51] <%allups> do good untell u do the bad
[4:05:54] <%razielhex> He's almost to the end
[4:06:05] <irfan_> just got back from when woolie took a bathroom break, did i miss anything s p i c y?
[4:06:06] <+ConLin_Arts_> CIA had help from some lad called Crocodile to cover Dubai in sand
[4:06:06] <derap41> @htt0r1hnz0 He's got his back can tine
[4:06:16] <Solidnick18> ok
[4:06:24] <Reizie_Etherealm> No, we're against the 33rd specifically right now
[4:06:27] <+htt0r1hnz0> oh..huh. never noticed
[4:06:29] <DatAsuna> Republic Commando was one of the first dynamic soundtracks
[4:06:29] <coracor> Adams does not give a FUCK
[4:06:32] <+RealThiele> a regiment under control by a colonel in the us army has 1500~ troops
[4:06:38] <%razielhex> Again, Mogwai's intense slow post-rock soundtrack to this level is great
[4:06:39] <Prevot> @ConLin_Arts_ so THATS why they got rid of the water
[4:06:40] <+htt0r1hnz0> BEST TRACK
[4:06:44] <+Darmanimon> rumuloh americans can't either to be fair
[4:06:51] <+MrAtheGreat> Looking forward to spoiler cast this week
[4:06:53] <i_heart_gaming> thst dude just got blown up
[4:06:59] <Reizie_Etherealm> "Sure, whatever"
[4:07:03] <SolSwagGuy56> Sure whatever :)
[4:07:14] <KeystoneA1> Like the boat section this part is a motherfucker on FUBAR difficulty
[4:07:15] <HeroToxiko> Notice how adams is immortal now?
[4:07:16] <+RealThiele> these guys would never reacclimate to life back home
[4:07:27] <dukenux> SAW
[4:07:27] <+htt0r1hnz0> @MrAtheGreat What's it about? what movie did they see again?
[4:07:35] <thetrashman_sc> @HeroToxiko he is?
[4:07:39] <thetrashman_sc> LUL
[4:07:39] <%razielhex> @RealThiele The assumption that they'll go back home is a strong one
[4:07:41] <SolSwagGuy56> What was he tying his shoes?
[4:07:53] <HeroToxiko> @thealientrilogy he was standing in the open lie he was LUL
[4:07:54] <coracor> LUL
[4:07:56] <+htt0r1hnz0> too low
[4:07:57] <+RealThiele> true, their warcrime bonus is into monster combo
[4:08:08] <gordieda20> LUL
[4:08:10] <coracor> you've died doing that before
[4:08:10] <SolSwagGuy56> I love how much Adam hates Walker now
[4:08:13] <HeroToxiko> @thealientrilogy im not sure if they fixed it but he always breaks during this chapter
[4:08:14] <+BionoidLCR> FailFish
[4:08:15] <Reizie_Etherealm> The true hell isn't here, it's when you return home and you can't get used that
[4:08:27] <petwisk> So warcrimes Don't give you I-frames
[4:08:43] <+RealThiele> he was helping, not doing crimes, that was the problem
[4:08:43] <+undercoverbarber> atpCarl
[4:08:48] <+MrAtheGreat> @htt0r1hnz0 no idea
[4:08:53] <Solidnick18> probably
[4:08:59] <irfan_> you can even say that you're the HERO
[4:09:06] <derap41> More like in medias res
[4:09:16] <zamzoph> is Woolie going crazy again?
[4:09:18] <petwisk> let's go Hero
[4:09:23] <buffmurffy> that may have been beforehand
[4:09:25] <+RealThiele> "going"
[4:09:31] <BallerSwagBro9k> @zamzoph Yes. Its immersive LUL
[4:09:33] <jorniev> OMGOHD now that one thing makes sense
[4:09:36] <+jiggy_snipe> I think was before all of this shit
[4:09:38] <derap41> "Kill Him"
[4:09:41] <+jiggy_snipe> he hates Konrad now
[4:09:42] <+MrAtheGreat> I think Minh's taalking about that collectible
[4:09:54] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @IndoorSitup
[4:09:56] <dukenux> Walker looked up to Konrad since Kabul
[4:09:57] <+MrAtheGreat> or that bit at teh very bveginning
[4:10:05] <dukenux> where he saved his life
[4:10:19] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> hes like Atreus now LUL
[4:10:23] <+aishman> I wish Minh realized there wasn't a game like this out at the time.
[4:10:26] <+RealThiele> shitty people can do good things occasionally: the game
[4:10:31] <HeroToxiko> @IndoorSitup less caps brother
[4:10:38] <Reizie_Etherealm> All this talk of putting people down would be really funny if we use the word snuff instead
[4:10:49] <%DesertPenguin> Just got home holy shit still going thought it was over
[4:10:49] <+jiggy_snipe> Lol
[4:10:51] <derap41> So chat know any good movie/tv show like The Terror or Apocalypse now something that just really grinds you down making you feel like shit
[4:10:54] <coracor> AIM HIGHER
[4:10:55] <+Minicaflip> HahaReindeer
[4:10:59] <derap41> I could use something like that after this
[4:11:01] <jorniev> NOW
[4:11:02] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> The Road
[4:11:04] <stanlychicken> how long are chat timeouts?
[4:11:07] <Nomad94> @RealThiele Or rather: "People can do really nasty shit believing themselves to be in the right"
[4:11:08] <+htt0r1hnz0> Minh missed the apportunity to complete it by saying "there THEY go" dangit!
[4:11:11] <%razielhex> This song is called, "Welcome to Hell" by Elia Cmíral.
[4:11:13] <%DesertPenguin> !uptime
[4:11:13] <+RealThiele> the expanse made me feel shitty as a sci fi
[4:11:13] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 4 hours and 11 minutes
[4:11:14] <oceanmatt> i think he shot the sniper first
[4:11:17] <derap41> @stanlychicken I've seen that already
[4:11:18] <jorniev> lugo kills the snipers
[4:11:21] <+jiggy_snipe> Adams slid a bit towards you
[4:11:21] <%DesertPenguin> I missed an hour and nothing changed lol
[4:11:26] <+htt0r1hnz0> thank @razielhex
[4:11:29] <derap41> great movie though really good book too
[4:11:33] <buffmurffy> @derap41 look up the movie "come and see". its a russian world war 2 movie that will fuck you up. its on youtube
[4:11:33] <%Exiliator> Big Boom Boom
[4:11:40] <+Javaa01> The AI will priorities more immediate threats if they're considered more dangerous
[4:11:41] <%DesertPenguin> Did I miss any major cutscenes where Woolie has a realization?
[4:11:50] <jorniev> some of them
[4:11:50] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:11:52] <%Louie_Salmon> I think he doesn't have the right gun for that, either that or he prioritizes enemies targeting him
[4:12:00] <%DesertPenguin> Okay I'll go back and be behind an hour. See ya later
[4:12:01] <DatAsuna> That's what binary domain does, minh
[4:12:02] <HeroToxiko> when you tell him to kill snipers he just runs out to be shot LUL
[4:12:04] <+jiggy_snipe> that would be weird if Adams stopped listening because he's still following you to Konrad
[4:12:05] <derap41> @buffmurffy no one know brutal like russians I'll look ut up
[4:12:24] <Reizie_Etherealm> Binary Domain was mediocre but cool af fite me
[4:12:25] <Solidnick18> lol
[4:12:26] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> LUL
[4:12:28] <petwisk> Now Woolie is a War Hero😏
[4:12:30] <%razielhex> @derap41 Russians love Ska music and post-rock.
[4:12:34] <dukenux> i just realized: If Woolie likes flanking and would like to give more shooters a chance, he should play Bia
[4:12:41] <dukenux> *Brothers in Arms

[4:14:58] <devil_may_cum_> Game making me feel like an opp :(
[4:15:00] <derap41> A good person wouldn't have Phosphored those civis
[4:15:14] <stanlychicken> only good people shoot civilians

[4:15:23] <+jiggy_snipe> wow Woolie LUL
[4:15:26] <devil_may_cum_> But they’re right
[4:15:28] <gordieda20> Easy mode is now selectable

[4:15:29] <%allups> whyd he walk back into the nade
[4:15:33] <+MrAtheGreat> Meanwhile these "tips" are openly antagonistic
[4:15:34] <derap41> Lore in loading screen is best
[4:15:35] <Mc_weak_to_arrow> this guy's right
[4:15:38] <petwisk> now i devided, do i watch Woolie do warcrimes ir watch Capcom style with DMC3 Full Style Switching and weapon Switching (That's actualy a Better System than 5's
[4:15:39] <Solidnick18> woolie is malfuctioning
[4:15:41] <+DreyfussFrost> Spoken like somebody that has never watched anybody else play a video game.
[4:15:44] <coracor> @allups woolie not very good at shooter
[4:15:45] <zamzoph> what if you actually learn something tho
[4:15:50] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Army of Two confirmed
[4:15:57] <startstoprepeat> it's always shit like "red barrels are explosive, try shooting them"
[4:16:01] <derap41> Taking a Jab ay army of two?
[4:16:05] <+undercoverbarber> Playing Army of Two confirmed
[4:16:10] <+Mrthefro> Death Stranding loading tips taught me something I didn't know more than a couple of times
[4:16:12] <Bunnykinght96> Woolie need to stop aiming low
[4:16:13] <Solidnick18> army of two with reggie
[4:16:16] <+jiggy_snipe> they give crap tips that assume you don't play video games
[4:16:19] <Mc_weak_to_arrow> even when a loading screen tip is good, it's really shitty that you just happen to learn that by chance because the game just happened to pick that one that time, instead of having a proper part of the game where you learn these things
[4:16:28] <derap41> Army Of Two was the epidemi of what this game really dislikes
[4:16:31] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> LUL oh man their broship is falling apart
[4:16:32] <+BionoidLCR> @Bunnykinght96 woolies garbo at shooters this will not change LUL
[4:16:32] <rumuloh> @startstoprepeat You say that as if they aren't needed, yet woolie misses and forgets every red barrel in this game
[4:16:36] <%razielhex> gonna need to flank that MG emplacement
[4:16:42] <arkv01> Minh approved tips©
[4:16:45] <%The_Timo> Yeah it would have to be Reggie, Woolie would murder Minh for just doing dumb BS all the time haha
[4:17:10] <%gatorafan> Imagine the guys playing Broforce
[4:17:19] <+MrRabbles> doesn't adams have one eye right now?

[4:20:31] <%razielhex> it'll never be remade. This game was an absolute horrid experience to develop.
[4:20:32] <+Toblo1> It still looks pretty good from here
[4:20:33] <SolSwagGuy56> The art direction is fucking great
[4:20:35] <buffmurffy> a remaster would be good
[4:20:37] <zamzoph> This game looked fine for 2012

[4:21:13] <+DreyfussFrost> Fun fact, this game was INTENTIONALLY made an an outdated version of Unreal Engine to make it look "off" compared to other games at the time.
[4:21:14] <Prevot> monkaS
[4:21:15] <CursedNobleman> THE FUUUURY

[4:23:03] <CrabSlacks> this part is almost more of a puzzle than a fight
[4:23:04] <warmnoid> RECON MISSION GONE WRONG
[4:23:05] <+jiggy_snipe> Woolie forgot, He's Walker
[4:23:05] <TigerClaws12> @deadbrainpl Unreal 4 was on a limited release and license back then. Would make more sense to work on a then-matured engine
[4:23:07] <Torgue_1> You forgot, Woolie!
[4:23:08] <+Toblo1> You were *SUPPOSED* to fall back
[4:23:08] <+undercoverbarber> Its going well so far Kappa
[4:23:10] <%biggdaddymike> Can you even remember why you came here?

[4:23:14] <+haitahaita> this game is so cool
[4:23:15] <+theAncopro> you were explicitely supposed to do NOthing
[4:23:15] <CursedNobleman> @allups magic? lemme look it up
[4:23:17] <%biggdaddymike> Woolie forgot
[4:23:17] <dukenux> Get in, see what's happening, get ou
[4:23:18] <%kyh9> But Walker can't just do his fucking job
[4:23:19] <Mc_weak_to_arrow> "Walker do you hear me? it's big boss here. I need you to turn off your PlayStation 3 system RIGHT NOW!"
[4:23:20] <%gatorafan> Woolie Vs Dubai, Gone Wrong, Gone Sexual
[4:23:31] <%kyh9> Heart of Darkness
[4:23:32] <Prevot> that changed like 30 min in didnt it
[4:23:34] <derap41> Walker just had to be the fucking hero
[4:23:35] <+StooEsq> damn, Woolie doesn't even remember, he's already gone
[4:23:38] <+MrRabbles> when your job was to get intel but instead you killed a fucking battalion
[4:23:40] <HeroToxiko> @allups the videogame sticky grenades are just balls of plastic explosive with detonators stabbed in.
[4:23:41] <jorniev> WOOLIE PLAY MGS2
[4:23:46] <dukenux> Woolie crossed the lien
[4:23:50] <+MrAtheGreat> ADAMS JUST SAID NO
[4:23:52] <TigerClaws12> war crimes closing in monkaS
[4:23:52] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> White Phos more scary than bullets
[4:23:53] <SolSwagGuy56> How the war crimes have turned
[4:23:54] <coracor> that was not the play
[4:23:54] <dukenux> i didn't know that
[4:23:55] <+kewlmyc> COVER TO YOUR LEFT
[4:23:56] <+Toblo1> .....wait that ADVANCES?
[4:23:59] <+MrAtheGreat> Woolie, you were supposed to go left
[4:24:01] <deadbrainpl> Adam told you to fuck off
[4:24:03] <Jestar_JoJo> woolieMIRIN
[4:24:04] <%biggdaddymike> Hot damn
[4:24:05] <jorniev> OOOOOOHH
[4:24:05] <+jiggy_snipe> was it advances?
[4:24:07] <UnfilteredComic> Is it real though?

[4:24:08] <dukenux> LUL

[4:24:11] <+jiggy_snipe> advancing*
[4:24:14] <rumuloh> "Go to the cover on the left" Better run forward
[4:24:16] <Solidnick18> i feel t
[4:24:16] <+MrAtheGreat> Oh, so that's why Mario ran so fast
[4:24:17] <zamzoph> I don't think it was moving
[4:24:17] <Prevot> the hunter has become the hunted
[4:24:18] <Reizie_Etherealm> This would never happen if there's a chain of command that constantly radio Walker to ask him about the status of the mission
[4:24:19] <i_heart_gaming> is it real though?
[4:24:24] <Avalon_One> It could be
[4:24:25] <devil_may_cum_> This is like one of my Japanese animes
[4:24:30] <jorniev> yup
[4:24:34] <Solidnick18> just do what adams says
[4:24:36] <%allups> yes that is real
[4:24:41] <+MrRabbles> LP tax
[4:24:42] <derap41> US is still the only nation to use white phosphorous mainly for smoke screening but you know
[4:24:44] <+MrAtheGreat> Adams isn't listening to walker and woolie's not listening to adams
[4:24:50] <HeroToxiko> @i_heart_gaming yes, they fired it at the begining of this section so walker had a flashback
[4:24:56] <bingobangoboingobongo> and lugo's not listening to anyone :)
[4:24:56] <+haitahaita> Walker walks good listens bad
[4:24:59] <CursedNobleman> so WW2 spicky bombs had a handle that held a flask of a bomb jelly thing

[4:25:35] <+StooEsq> they're like 1 step away from Glory Kills
[4:25:38] <bingobangoboingobongo> heroic murder is the best murder :)
[4:25:38] <+kewlmyc> Woolie doesn't know how grenade launchers work, does he?
[4:25:44] <coracor> he sure doesnt

[4:28:45] <buffmurffy> catch up to adams

[4:28:46] <+Darmanimon> god just aim higher woolie3
[4:28:46] <+MrAtheGreat> someone plz think of the children
[4:28:47] <Reizie_Etherealm> Oh so it's the game's quote, I see
[4:28:50] <CursedNobleman> parabolic tragectory :(
[4:28:59] <alrobot2014> that was what adams said to do
[4:29:10] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> i think youre supposed to keep moving forward until you can take a turret base
[4:29:10] <%allups> good movement tho
[4:29:12] <+undercoverbarber> atpUgly atpUgly
[4:29:23] <+MrRabbles> adams is out right refusing orders
[4:29:29] <+Xeno351> you're supposed to take base by base
[4:29:38] <Solidnick18> just do it
[4:29:40] <derap41> That's one tought humvee
[4:29:42] <Solidnick18> big hero man
[4:29:43] <Bunnykinght96> Follow adam
[4:29:43] <+MrAtheGreat> Cover to cover wools
[4:29:46] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> youre supposed to move cover by cover until you can shorten the gap
[4:29:48] <dukenux> THis party's getting CRAZY
[4:29:54] <devil_may_cum_> Loco
[4:29:55] <%TheSniperJoe> The key to this game is movement. You need to constantly be flanking, shifting position, and getting new lanes of fire.
[4:29:55] <+MrAtheGreat> You'll be fine
[4:29:57] <Solidnick18> RUN
[4:30:03] <jorniev> look at adams
[4:30:12] <rumuloh> FUCKIN RUN
[4:30:15] <Avalon_One> @Reizie_Etherealm This whole game is basically just constantly calling out people who play these sort of games.
[4:30:17] <+undercoverbarber> Just go doodHokey
[4:30:18] <+jiggy_snipe> follow Adams
[4:30:20] <AnthroMetal> woolie what is run
[4:30:20] <+MrAtheGreat> Follow adams
[4:30:20] <CursedNobleman> NotLikeThis
[4:30:21] <Solidnick18> almost
[4:30:22] <dukenux> speaking of which, this isn't DMC, it's okay to get hit as long as you wont die
[4:30:26] <Medo3G> brisk walk
[4:30:32] <%biggdaddymike> Follow Adams
[4:30:33] <%allups> id save the RPG and explosive shots
[4:30:38] <BallerSwagBro9k> Ill take RUN for 800 Alex
[4:30:38] <ManlyMcBeefington> save rpg
[4:30:39] <+kewlmyc> FOLLOW ADAMS
[4:30:42] <LokimenD> Slow Ops The Line
[4:30:46] <%The_Timo> Gotta Arc those nade shots better
[4:30:52] <+MrRabbles> the problem with following adams is that the ai will walk into fire
[4:30:52] <+jiggy_snipe> save your RPG
[4:30:57] <coracor> Snail Ops: The Trail
[4:30:59] <%allups> rpg the bunker
[4:31:01] <oceanmatt> rpg the bunkers
[4:31:02] <+MrRabbles> and the game has taught woolie not to follow them
[4:31:14] <HakunaGrakata> They wont spawn on you if you cross the road
[4:31:19] <jorniev> no its calling out people who enjoy the killing in these games without thinking about the real life concequences
[4:31:28] <derap41> When Shooters turn into puzzle games
[4:31:40] <+undercoverbarber> doodHokey atpFeelsBeardMan doodHokey atpFeelsBeardMan atpToiler doodHokey atpToiler atpFeelsBeardMan
[4:31:41] <+DreyfussFrost> The AI walks into fire because giving them orders to kill someone overwrites their normal behavior. They'll leave cover to kill the target you mark.
[4:31:52] <jorniev> woolie dont turtle up!
[4:31:56] <+htt0r1hnz0> anyone else's audio seem off? Might just be me
[4:31:57] <deadbrainpl> I don't think it's even calling them out? The devs stated that they just want you to think about why people enjoy military power fantasies
[4:32:08] <Reizie_Etherealm> Because there are no real life consequences?
[4:32:10] <+htt0r1hnz0> nvm
[4:32:12] <Avalon_One> @jorniev That's a much better way of putting it
[4:32:12] <+MrRabbles> Woolie has seen the ai walk directly into fire and died as a result of following them without giving them orders
[4:32:15] <+MrAtheGreat> @htt0r1hnz0 Man seems fine
[4:32:18] <dukenux> because they're power fantasies?
[4:32:18] <+DreyfussFrost> See, Adams says what to do.
[4:32:29] <+MrAtheGreat> mine* shit
[4:32:29] <CursedNobleman> wow LUL
[4:32:30] <Kilborn119> the problem with this end is that the gameplay makes you want to turtle up but you are really supposed to just keep moving
[4:32:31] <%allups> @jorniev u simple cant do that in uncharted or else itll be unplayable lol
[4:32:40] <derap41> @deadbrainpl yeah remember "Thing is" Doesn't mean Thing bad
[4:32:44] <+htt0r1hnz0> didn't notice that my stream dropped quality for a sec lol
[4:32:44] <dukenux> and this game does the opposite and doesnt pat you on the back for "job well done"
[4:32:51] <+Xeno351> adams just walking up slowly and killing em LUL
[4:32:57] <CursedNobleman> ... LUL
[4:32:57] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:32:58] <derap41> Wow
[4:33:01] <thetrashman_sc> i tried playing uncharted and it was wild how many people you murder
[4:33:03] <+MrAtheGreat> "don't fucking tempt me"
[4:33:05] <bingobangoboingobongo> don't tempt him LUL
[4:33:14] <D3rrtyD4n> he looks like dookie
[4:33:15] <deadbrainpl> And remember they wanted to deconstruct a very specific genre of games - like COD, in which the power fantasy is all about being a big military hero
[4:33:20] <rumuloh> "To the right to the right!" What a puzzle
[4:33:29] <masterfire23> when did this become getting into shooting games for GLORY
[4:33:29] <+MrAtheGreat> Go to adams man

[4:57:43] <+DreyfussFrost> @chesterr01 There are 3 other endings that all start by shooting Konrad.
[4:57:43] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> You still wiped out 33rd, Lugo and Adams still died
[4:57:44] <+QueequegTheater> Because he wanted to be a hero
[4:57:45] <+admiral_of_crunch> Konrad's direct involvement was all in Walker's JO fantasy
[4:57:49] <thealientrilogy> Definitely LOOK at the other ENDINGS, they're all really interesting.

[4:58:57] <NotHereToStream> konrad Kappa
[4:59:00] <+QueequegTheater> BABBY IS PRANGENT
[4:59:10] <krabsan> man this game is great
[4:59:19] <bingobangoboingobongo> drink water chat, dehydration is bad :)
[4:59:21] <derap41> When no one knew
[4:59:23] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Konrads VA is so fucking great
[4:59:24] <petwisk> This is a Hell of a Game
[4:59:28] <%DensityD> did the game objectives make it easy to keep killing people and pushing forward? "game objective points forward, so I have no choice"
[4:59:35] <%allups> i happy thy liked it i thought thy would not be noticed or not liked it
[4:59:36] <lilmac64> It is I am good because what I do is good vs. What I do is good because I am good.
[4:59:37] <VidulaSaix> Definitely wasn't feeling the game early on, but once it got going yeah pretty dope game
[4:59:38] <dukenux> All VAs are great in this. great directing all around
[4:59:41] <+Toblo1> Konrad and Walker's VAs are so fucking good.
[4:59:43] <DatAsuna> Call of duty has done a similar ending like 3 times though
[4:59:45] <+Toblo1> Its Nolan's best work
[4:59:45] <masterfire23> what a hero
[4:59:48] <%Louie_Salmon> Yeah dudebros jumping into this had a fun time for sure
[4:59:58] <Reizie_Etherealm> RUN GOD DAMMIT is a pretty good objective
[5:00:02] <devil_may_cum_> Strong ass game
[5:00:02] <%allups> it is nolans best work for sure
[5:00:05] <HeroToxiko> Too bad the game was rushed and buggy FeelsBadMan
[5:00:06] <+tuchpi> only Woolie is the mgs fan DansGame
[5:00:07] <UnfilteredComic> moon2PH
[5:00:08] <+QueequegTheater> @DatAsuna Not nearly as well
[5:00:12] <derap41> @Louie_Salmon I didn't :(
[5:00:12] <NotHereToStream> black ops 1 was the whole "its in your head luigi"
[5:00:13] <+trialbyrespawn> this game is pretentious
[5:00:14] <KaseKaizer> We trust you Boss strip7
[5:00:15] <DatAsuna> It was not a rushed game lol
[5:00:19] <lilmac64> This game's plot is unironically better than anything Kojima has ever done.
[5:00:20] <SolSwagGuy56> Are we still pretending MGSV was a good story?
[5:00:20] <+Typhaeon> Fictional characters might not have come to harm had the player decided not to play Kappa
[5:00:22] <Bunnykinght96> Facts call of duty did do it
[5:00:22] <%DensityD> terminal 7
[5:00:22] <dukenux> Yeah, i think Nolan said he's most proud of this role
[5:00:23] <mdkcde> a lot of ludokino people got mad at the game for this
[5:00:24] <%Exiliator> Fun game!
[5:00:24] <Avalon_One> This game is a great example for the argument that Games are art
[5:00:24] <+arcielardor> play the other endings, Woolie!
[5:00:24] <+htt0r1hnz0> @allups FUN TRIVIA: Nolan North said that THIS is his favorite role
[5:00:25] <+Toblo1> @Reizie_Etherealm Its either that or "OBEY"
[5:00:26] <DatAsuna> This game took a while to release
[5:00:30] <MutedMimic> spooky2B
[5:00:34] <buffmurffy> im glad woolie liked it
[5:00:34] <+QueequegTheater> Oh yeah, stuck in dev hell
[5:00:38] <+htt0r1hnz0> He will!
[5:00:50] <DatAsuna> People confuse rushed for "not triple A"

[5:01:09] <DatAsuna> Kayne and Lynch
[5:01:09] <+Darmanimon> pretentious is used only against things people can't understand, never towards anything actually pretentious. This game is great in storytelling

[5:01:10] <derap41> Army Of Two was good
[5:01:13] <+Mrthefro> Quantum Theory LUL
[5:01:13] <+htt0r1hnz0> Gears of War
[5:01:14] <%allups> @htt0r1hnz0 had no idea thx for sharing im a big uncharted fan
[5:01:14] <RamenRiderZ> "This is good....isn't it?"
[5:01:14] <%DensityD> hot take
[5:01:15] <DarknessD42> Front mission evolve
[5:01:15] <DatAsuna> No it wasn't
[5:01:16] <+QueequegTheater> Modern Warfare 2 and 3, specifically
[5:01:18] <%DensityD> chat explodes
[5:01:19] <+BionoidLCR> wo slow down army of two is great
[5:01:21] <+htt0r1hnz0> NP
[5:01:21] <+undercoverbarber> Army of Two play through confirmed
[5:01:22] <dmysta3000> Kain and Lynch?
[5:01:24] <+johnny_gogo> 40th day was good one is pretty bad
[5:01:27] <keyworthe> army of two was the SHIT
[5:01:32] <SilentPredator03> Zero Tolerance was a Genesis game
[5:01:33] <+Typhaeon> Urban Chaos was the shit
[5:01:35] <IndoorSitup> This isn't just a commentary on military shooters. It's also a commentary on American interventionism, the same interventionism that fucked up Vietnam and is currently fucking up Afganistan and Iraq.
[5:01:44] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Ropcord
[5:01:45] <+BionoidLCR> urban chaos is amazing lol
[5:01:49] <DatAsuna> @Darmanimon IDK the lead writer saying walker died in the copter crash and dreamed the rest is a tad pretentious
[5:01:49] <SolSwagGuy56> This game had a fn art direction, interesting character development in a organic way, and a baller sound track
[5:01:51] <krabsan> Uncharted is way better tho
[5:01:54] <+QueequegTheater> Gears of War, for all the memes, is a legitimately super fun game
[5:01:56] <+johnny_gogo> gears is so fun still if your just messing around
[5:01:58] <Morning_Asakura> urban chaos was rocksteady right
[5:02:00] <%allups> it still feels better then days gone tho
[5:02:02] <+Mrthefro> Kill switch
[5:02:03] <dukenux> Hot(?) take: I think the explanation where everything is Walker's personal purgatory that loops into helicopter moment is the only one that makes sense. Atleast past that crash
[5:02:06] <SolSwagGuy56> But people get mad mad cause of "muh choice :-:"
[5:02:09] <SilentPredator03> Winback
[5:02:09] <+Darmanimon> the lead writer is pretentious then, not the story
[5:02:10] <derap41> @IndoorSitup absolutely you don't think all those vets wanted to be heros
[5:02:11] <%Irridium> Inversion
[5:02:11] <+Toblo1> Black?
[5:02:12] <mrblack499> army of two 40th day can be fun with gold ak47 lol
[5:02:12] <DatAsuna> Black Ops 3 is very pretentious, and I love black ops 3
[5:02:13] <Ropcord> RE4?
[5:02:15] <+MrAtheGreat> Gears 2 feels better than Spec Ops, but Gears 1 feels freaking awful by modern standards
[5:02:16] <+Toblo1> Breakdown?
[5:02:17] <+jiggy_snipe> yea Killswitch
[5:02:17] <xxshadowxx416> woolie you should play gears
[5:02:20] <Torgue_1> Killswitch, yeah
[5:02:22] <HeroToxiko> @Ropcord LUL
[5:02:23] <Javthusiast> tbird
[5:02:24] <deadbrainpl> Also guys? The first thing you see in the game? A STOP sign
[5:02:25] <@Solidus_113> Killzone was first person
[5:02:26] <+BionoidLCR> killswitch
[5:02:26] <+MrAtheGreat> Killswitch is third
[5:02:28] <bingobangoboingobongo> bulletsorm?
[5:02:33] <Javthusiast> killswitch was 3rd
[5:02:33] <+QueequegTheater> @Ropcord RE4 didn't have cover shooting
[5:02:35] <+BionoidLCR> no it wasnt
[5:02:35] <DatAsuna> Also Gears 5 Kait theme, best OST track of 2019 come at me
[5:02:37] <+BionoidLCR> it was 3rd
[5:02:38] <brionicman> killswitch
[5:02:39] <dukenux> Also i like the game, despite NOT buying into meta narrative.
[5:02:40] <zamzoph> Killswitch was before Gears of War
[5:02:41] <+MrAtheGreat> Killswitch is what inspired Gears
[5:02:43] <CrabSlacks> shit in this game is happening in real life, soldiers fighting people armed by the CIA
[5:02:43] <Avalon_One> I think Gears is more fun than this game when it comes to gameplay, but this story blows gears right out of the water
[5:02:45] <Ropcord> it had like two clunky cover sections tho LUL
[5:02:47] <%The_Timo> Oh Winback was bad
[5:02:49] <HeroToxiko> killswitch invented waist high cover
[5:02:56] <DatAsuna> Remember the quantum of solace game?
[5:02:58] <%DensityD> wooliePOYO woolieWUT
[5:02:58] <Reizie_Etherealm> Killswitch the PS2 game? That was great back in its time, I loved it as a kid
[5:02:59] <@Moobot> Please don't fill up the entire chat, @admiral_of_crunch
[5:03:00] <SolSwagGuy56> Honestly I'd say the story isn't over
[5:03:03] <DedlokPM> Winback was all right. i liked it
[5:03:03] <+Typhaeon> I think you mean Urban Chaos: Riot Response since there's an earlier Urban Chaos
[5:03:10] <derap41> Operation Desert storm was another good one
[5:03:13] <+RealThiele> renegade or paragon
[5:03:19] <+RealThiele> you 'decide'
[5:03:22] <+admiral_of_crunch> A contentious point with this game is that it railroads you into many bad decisions, like with the White Phosphorus specifically, so players feel disconnected when the game tries to guilt them for their choices. I don’t think that’s what the game is actually doing, and I think the dissonance you feel with Walker is ultimately intentional.
[5:03:23] <+theAncopro> theres no karma system, but IT SURE FEELS like it
[5:03:23] <+QueequegTheater> What's this "you" bullshit, Woolie?
[5:03:23] <+MrAtheGreat> Died of thirst
[5:03:25] <+Dr_DangerPhD> there's a gba version of killswitch that is ok, kinda ambitious in its design
[5:03:26] <hntronium> Gameplay was rough, music and dialogue were great though, but I don't buy the meta narrative
[5:03:30] <BallerSwagBro9k> Theyre doomed. No water
[5:03:31] <alrobot2014> they'd all die from thirst anyway
[5:03:32] <+admiral_of_crunch> The game isn't blaming you for making bad decisions, it's mocking you for partaking in this absurd video game military fantasy, and Walker epitomizes a "video game" war hero person that revels in said fantasy. WALKER doesn't give the player a choice, and all of this shit is on his shoulders.
[5:03:33] <+Toblo1> They're goading and laughing as you left
[5:03:37] <+Toblo1> *As they ran
[5:03:38] <@Solidus_113> Did they though?
[5:03:39] <+admiral_of_crunch> In the white phosphorus scene, Lugo says there’s always a choice, and Walker shuts him down instantly. Walker is the guy who’s forcing everyone into this situation, and the player is just along for the ride, which the game snidely leans into. WALKER is the game's punching bag, not you, which I think a lot of people overlooked.
[5:03:39] <%allups> thy have to live in that horrible city
[5:03:40] <SilentPredator03> Water's gone, they dead
[5:03:41] <masterfire23> walker followed his nindo and became hokage
[5:03:43] <BallerSwagBro9k> Chain if Command
[5:03:44] <+MrAtheGreat> They never lost faith in you
[5:03:46] <VidulaSaix> That's what soldiers do
[5:03:48] <%biggdaddymike> 100% Loyality
[5:03:50] <+Toblo1> Chain Of Command/Loyalty, I guess?
[5:03:52] <%allups> reload the save
[5:03:55] <%biggdaddymike> Just following Orders
[5:03:55] <+undercoverbarber> They had their own reasoning?
[5:03:56] <PlumpPotatoRump> 'I was ordered to do it.'
[5:03:59] <juxtest> Where else are they gonna go
[5:04:00] <+theAncopro> trust you but doesn't agree with you
[5:04:01] <bingobangoboingobongo> kingslayer :)
[5:04:02] <+QueequegTheater> @allups they're going to
[5:04:03] <Ropcord> they're making excuses too
[5:04:03] <+tuchpi> you don't :)
[5:04:04] <SolSwagGuy56> They were complicit. They were already fucked
[5:04:05] <BallerSwagBro9k> Thats a really hard choice
[5:04:05] <VidulaSaix> "He turned us into killers!"
[5:04:06] <Avalon_One> To them you're the worst thing that's ever happened to them.
[5:04:06] <NotHereToStream> follow orders or court martial
[5:04:06] <Javthusiast> I was ordered bro Kappa
[5:04:11] <+Toblo1> Or maybe they *also* want someone to blame
[5:04:12] <+RealThiele> dubai in 2077 when it hits 150f regularly
[5:04:13] <DatAsuna> he wasn't tho
[5:04:20] <%allups> @QueequegTheater thanks
[5:04:20] <+Toblo1> Because otherwise they're complicit
[5:04:22] <DatAsuna> the game literally showed him standing still not moving and them asking wtf
[5:04:24] <+jiggy_snipe> when you're CO commits war crimes
[5:04:25] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @jorniev
[5:04:26] <Ropcord> E
[5:04:27] <townzzzzz> why did the 33rd continue to fight if konrad was already dead?
[5:04:28] <SolSwagGuy56> They are just as responsible
[5:04:31] <derap41> number one rule you stay with the guy you share a trench with
[5:04:33] <deadbrainpl> This game gets a bit heavy-handed about that some stuff, but I like that they TRIED something new or at least wanted you to think. And the devs KNEW people are going to be angry about being forced to do that stuff.
[5:04:33] <IndoorSitup> ow my ears
[5:04:37] <dukenux> Chain of command is what this whole story hangs on. Why would Lugo and Addams follow you otherwise, after finding that radio?
[5:04:39] <+unclekulikov> You can't trust soldiers to not shoot.
[5:04:42] <+trialbyrespawn> respected the loyalty
[5:04:42] <+QueequegTheater> Fun fact, "I ways following orders" is NOT a defense against war crimes
[5:04:47] <SolSwagGuy56> I think Adams was pro White Phophorus
[5:04:54] <+MrAtheGreat> If you think about it, Walker could have been their anchor to sanity. It was fine for them to kill people because it's walker fault
[5:04:59] <BallerSwagBro9k> @townzzzzz They were the good guys. They were trying to save people but the CIA was sabotaging them
[5:05:03] <+RealThiele> also fun fact, america will invade the hague if americans are tried for war crimes
[5:05:06] <krabsan> @admiral_of_crunch i agree with everything you just said my man, i think the "railroading" is intentional ludonarrative
[5:05:08] <derap41> Chain of command only works for the winning side
[5:05:10] <%allups> eyah he fucking loves that shit @SolSwagGuy56
[5:05:15] <deadbrainpl> Also people notice the Walker-Player parallel, but a lot of people miss the Konrad-Developers parallel
[5:05:20] <Memdosu> actually it was bc they believed they were doing the right thing. You are not supposed to follow UNLAWFUL ORDERS, but bc of the complicated situation they thought they were doing the right thing.
[5:05:22] <Reizie_Etherealm> How come there's no commanding officer Walker has to answer to? No one radio in to ask the status of the mission
[5:05:22] <+Typhaeon> A mistake a lot of non-military people make is to assume that the chain of command is absolute
[5:05:27] <SolSwagGuy56> @allups He has a canteen full of the stuff
[5:05:27] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Another way to look at it is that Adams and Lugo represent Walker's desire to be a hero and his self-loathing respectively
[5:05:27] <rumuloh> When you are being shot at, orders are orders.
[5:05:48] <SilentPredator03> @Reizie_Etherealm sandstorm blocked comms
[5:05:49] <dukenux> Also, im probably going into "itsnotthatdeep" territory now, but: Walker - ego, Lugo - id, Addams - superego? but then Lugo dies...
[5:05:51] <SolSwagGuy56> Everyone including Adams and Lugo comitted war crimes and fucked shit
[5:05:55] <Rodzzila> Yeah, but Germany lose that war. If Germany would have won the ones that didn't follow ordered would have been the fuck ones
[5:05:58] <+QueequegTheater> Minh please never work for an international court
[5:05:59] <NotHereToStream> im sure there is an army, don't which country, where you're allowed to go against order if ther order is perceived very inhumane
[5:06:00] <PlumpPotatoRump> But they let those actions happen, they still hold responsibility
[5:06:01] <%allups> @SolSwagGuy56 cant get enough
[5:06:02] <derap41> You went from mistakenly firing on Marines to straight up slaughtering them without questions
[5:06:02] <+htt0r1hnz0> @Reizie_Etherealm Storm blocked all comms. They had to walk all the way out of it to radio someone
[5:06:03] <SolSwagGuy56> All 3 were complicit on the water shit
[5:06:09] <krabsan> @dukenux seems a bit like a reach
[5:06:12] <SolSwagGuy56> OTHER ENDINGS
[5:06:13] <+admiral_of_crunch> Back in the White Phosphorus scene, Lugo insists there's a choice, but Walker shuts him down. WALKER is the guy not giving anyone a choice, including the player.
[5:06:15] <+RealThiele> SNAFU command, orders?
[5:06:21] <%allups> yeah that water shit was just wrong
[5:06:22] <+jiggy_snipe> you can't commit crimes on the battlefield
[5:06:25] <IndoorSitup> @woolieversus This game isn't just a commentary on military shooters. It's also a commentary on American interventionism, the same interventionism that fucked up Vietnam and is currently fucking up Afganistan and Iraq. The American military is made up of imperfect people but everyone expects them to do their jobs perfectly, but they're still only human.
[5:06:27] <derap41> Remember when you first meet the marines
[5:06:39] <Reizie_Etherealm> I firmly believe it's the duty/responsibility of the subordinate to disobey a warcrime order from your psychopathic CO
[5:06:40] <SolSwagGuy56> Honestly this game has more balls in talking about war shit then MGSV
[5:06:42] <+luigintbknss> There’s a theory that he died at the helicopter section and the rest of the game is just his personal hell
[5:06:49] <dukenux> @krabsan yeah, probably, but it would line up with Lugo acting on impulses so much. And Addams trying to keep things in order.
[5:06:50] <krabsan> @IndoorSitup oh man this is super right
[5:06:56] <derap41> Think of all those veterans that wanted to be heros
[5:06:57] <SolSwagGuy56> Fucking Kojima pussed out making Venom or Big Boss a monster
[5:07:03] <+tuchpi> one guy PogChamp
[5:07:06] <mdkcde> now kill konrad
[5:07:12] <+MrAtheGreat> resume
[5:07:13] <alrobot2014> chapter select chapter 15
[5:07:15] <zamzoph> resume
[5:07:16] <+RealThiele> you too can commit war crimes and get your own clothing line
[5:07:16] <dukenux> Intel
[5:07:20] <devil_may_cum_> Very well said
[5:07:22] <%allups> multiplayer maps
[5:07:23] <+Toblo1> @luigintbknss I've always been kinda torn on that theory.
[5:07:25] <+johnny_gogo> Dlc is just multiplayer
[5:07:25] <+MrAtheGreat> resume sould do it
[5:07:26] <Javthusiast> @solswagguy56 true
[5:07:27] <warmnoid> time for multiplayer LUL
[5:07:30] <alrobot2014> oh both work
[5:07:34] <+MrAtheGreat> The developers know
[5:07:34] <DedlokPM> resume game takes you to the tower ye
[5:07:39] <TigerClaws12> now i'm just imagining ways Kojima can fuck this premise up LUL
[5:07:40] <HeroToxiko> @SolSwagGuy56 kojima had no plan, as stated by kojima himself
[5:07:40] <+admiral_of_crunch> @WoolieVersus Check out the intel in Konrad's flat
[5:07:41] <%allups> the multiplayer was ok i enjoyed what i played
[5:07:45] <+tuchpi> Spec Ops the Line For Fun PogChamp
[5:07:47] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Fun fact: there is a picture of Konrad's face on a bus in the first chapter, and during a rappelling section you can see a noose around Lugo's neck in a window reflection
[5:07:48] <buffmurffy> oh go through the chapters, it highlights different parts of the map
[5:07:52] <deadbrainpl> The Dev has said that the "Walker died and is in hell" theory is a valid interpretation but he didn't want to make it the only one
[5:07:53] <+RealThiele> forever war
[5:07:57] <ryderbootz> fight forever!
[5:07:59] <krabsan> @dukenux true but that might be more pattern finding on your part that intentionally thought, doesn't make it a bad theory though
[5:08:00] <Reizie_Etherealm> FIGHT FOREVER
[5:08:01] <mrsnowman777> the only right choice is to stop playing
[5:08:01] <SolSwagGuy56> @HeroToxiko Honestly fuck Kojima he hasn't made a good game since MGS4
[5:08:05] <Avalon_One> It's a theory I can see being a thing, but I think it serves the story better that they live through the helicopter
[5:08:08] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @eldritch_kev15
[5:08:10] <morow1ec> Honestly i can't belive this game was allowed to be made in 2012
[5:08:10] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1222044563210145793?s=19

[5:08:14] <%allups> eyah the multiplayer really didnt fit the mood lol
[5:08:14] <%Louie_Salmon> Hasn't the US been at war for over 95% of it's existence
[5:08:14] <derap41> Not a perfect game but its way more interesting then say gears of war

[5:08:24] <NotHereToStream> but for yooou
[5:08:25] <%Louie_Salmon> War: FOR FUN
[5:08:26] <dukenux> @TigerClaws12 Konrad was Walker's father/clone. CIA was there to retrieve metal gear. Lugo is a sexy lady now.
[5:08:26] <%biggdaddymike> Hell yeah
[5:08:26] <+MrRabbles> for warcrimes
[5:08:26] <+trialbyrespawn> it's always for fun

[5:08:27] <Halospaz117> FOR WAR CRIMES
[5:08:29] <+QueequegTheater> @Avalon_One The head writer said that he thinks Walker died in the prologue
[5:08:30] <startstoprepeat> i forget how you trigger it, but i remember there being a thing with the saluting soldiers where you can leave and come back and reveal they're already dead
[5:08:31] <%gatorafan> Wait, he's checking all the endings?
[5:08:33] <SolSwagGuy56> @hntronium I got the spicy takes
[5:08:35] <AnthroMetal> @Louie_Salmon murica
[5:08:37] <TechDragon_Z> For a false sens of heroism
[5:08:42] <+RealThiele> after a certain amount of time on the field id imagine a soldier cant reassimilate to civilian life, too much psychic damage
[5:08:43] <CursedNobleman> @deadbrainpl i think artists of games like this dont really care what the real answer is, theyre just happy that people are thinking and engaging with their work

[5:09:13] <SolSwagGuy56> We are KING OF DUBAI
[5:09:14] <deadbrainpl> Yeah, there is a lot of creepy shit in the game though - like you can see Konrads face on billboards since chapter 1
[5:09:19] <+trialbyrespawn> the story makes no sense
[5:09:20] <+CoronetChris> All I'm saying is GIVE WAR A CHANCE!
[5:09:27] <derap41> Take this compared to Call of Duty saying their games aren't political

[5:11:30] <TigerClaws12> same ending LUL
[5:11:30] <+Javaa01> You pull the trigger on yourself if you don't act

[5:11:35] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @WoolieVersus this one is the same, the only difference is your failure to admit your fault

[5:11:37] <%Irridium> gotta shoot konrad
[5:11:41] <devil_may_cum_> Same ending lmao
[5:11:41] <krabsan> To be fair I did the same thing when i played this lol
[5:11:43] <SolSwagGuy56> @HeroToxiko Except he had Peace Walker and Ground Zeroes to do ANYTHING and he did jack shit
[5:11:44] <dukenux> SHOOT. THE GLASS.
[5:11:45] <%jinking79> No one told him Chat
[5:11:48] <+Toblo1> This Is The Power Of Requiem
[5:11:48] <+undercoverbarber> Idiot
[5:11:49] <+kewlmyc> No
[5:11:49] <+JamesCorck> But the future refused to change.
[5:11:52] <+Typhaeon> And he was so good at hitting L1 before
[5:11:54] <devil_may_cum_> Can’t blame did the same thing
[5:11:55] <+Toblo1> The Future Refused To Change
[5:11:56] <%The_Timo> Is he just noticing that now?
[5:11:56] <coracor> But that's wrong
[5:11:57] <+jiggy_snipe> it's fine he was just checking
[5:11:58] <+QueequegTheater> YOU WILL NEVER REACH THE TRUTH
[5:11:58] <+ConLin_Arts_> He pretty much makes you shoot yourself
[5:11:59] <jorniev> skip
[5:12:04] <morow1ec> Konrad is a part of you. Him killing you is also just killing yourself
[5:12:06] <Avalon_One> You will never reach truth Walker
[5:12:06] <CursedNobleman> KING CRIMSON
[5:12:06] <jorniev> THAT
[5:12:07] <SomersaultJustice> does the other guy just shoot out an aegis reflector and reflect the bullet back at you?
[5:12:07] <KeystoneA1> He is you, so you shoot yourself
[5:12:11] <+JamesCorck> Reset the clock!
[5:12:13] <+BionoidLCR> no he didnt
[5:12:15] <17sevens> There's some intel in the level you should try and read as well
[5:12:18] <%allups> that logic is good to remember tho
[5:12:20] <PlumpPotatoRump> @somersaultjustice loool
[5:12:21] <petwisk> to acheive the fake endings you need to shoot Konrad
[5:12:23] <+Javaa01> But when Konrad pulls the trigger, that's YOUR self conscious deciding FOR YOU
[5:12:26] <RamenRiderZ> [ MERCY ] doesnt work here
[5:12:29] <+RealThiele> cant pacifist this ending war criminal
[5:12:29] <+trialbyrespawn> this isn't one of those games
[5:12:31] <BallerSwagBro9k> If u Shoot him theres 3 more endings after
[5:12:34] <Reizie_Etherealm> It's fine, it's better to confirm and safely lock down each option
[5:12:36] <dukenux> @WoolieVersus Explore Konrad's apartment before facing him. There's intel there.
[5:12:38] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Is Walker's stand The Fool but with white phosphorous
[5:12:44] <zamzoph> Battlefied 4's endings don't let you sacrifice yourself for some reason
[5:12:46] <alrobot2014> @chesterr01 i believe there's intel around here
[5:12:49] <+MrAtheGreat> Fair enough
[5:12:51] <Reizie_Etherealm> LUL
[5:12:54] <+jiggy_snipe> @chesterr01 tell Woolie to get the intel
[5:12:55] <krabsan> This is true
[5:12:55] <+tuchpi> no :)
[5:12:58] <%allups> yeah i agree with woolie
[5:13:00] <+RealThiele> he fucked a mermaid
[5:13:05] <keyworthe> it's a game from 2010 dont expect shit like that
[5:13:06] <AnthroMetal> schrodinger's konrad?
[5:13:09] <derap41> I'd fuck a mermaid
[5:13:12] <+trialbyrespawn> this game isn't that creative enough
[5:13:12] <jorniev> doooooont
[5:13:12] <+QueequegTheater> THE U.S. MiLiTARY DOES NOT CONDONE THE KILLING OF UNARMED COMBATANTS, BUT THIS IS A GAME SO WHY SHOULD YOU CARE
[5:13:13] <+PhantomMiG> The meta narrative tells you that you should make a choice
[5:13:13] <+freeizone> 1.. 2.. FIVE
[5:13:14] <KeystoneA1> There's intel in Conrad's penthouse
[5:13:16] <jorniev> upstairs
[5:13:20] <thetrashman_sc> regular or reverse @derap41
[5:13:21] <+JamesCorck> Upstairs there's one piece of intel.
[5:13:23] <PlumpPotatoRump> its a slow walk area if there is a secret, fuck the game. :c
[5:13:23] <CrabSlacks> it's in conrads room
[5:13:25] <CursedNobleman> AMZN is up 11% PRAISE THE SUN
[5:13:27] <+freeizone> [ FORCED WALKING ]
[5:13:27] <startstoprepeat> @WoolieVersus try walking back to the entrance after the soldiers salute you
[5:13:28] <hntronium> @derap41 But what kind. Human top or fish top?
[5:13:28] <jorniev> konrad
[5:13:30] <KeystoneA1> @WoolieVersus last intel is in Conrad's penthouse
[5:13:31] <+spacehouse> intel in penthouse
[5:13:32] <%Zanethepure> There are actually a couple moments that are not strictly binary in this game, the crowd is a really good one
[5:13:33] <%allups> the game actaully has shit like that tho
[5:13:35] <VidulaSaix> No way they're real
[5:13:36] <zamzoph> they're super not real
[5:13:36] <emroktheverdant> Looks like woolie already lost
[5:13:37] <Reizie_Etherealm> Imagine if you turn the chair and there's a belt around Konrad's neck
[5:13:39] <xxshadowxx416> no
[5:13:40] <derap41> @thetrashman_sc regular facefucking is a thing
[5:13:40] <krabsan> @keyworthe with everything that has happened i think its fair to expect what woolie expected
[5:13:40] <Ganfur> why would they guard a dead body
[5:13:41] <+cvp5127> they're too clean
[5:13:42] <dukenux> No way theyre real
[5:13:42] <BallerSwagBro9k> They would not surrender to Walker
[5:13:43] <@chesterr01> upstairs, ok, where? going there live
[5:13:47] <+RealThiele> reverse mermaid has no S U C C
[5:13:47] <Avalon_One> They're ghooooosts

[5:13:55] <SolSwagGuy56> The holy spirit
[5:13:56] <derap41> They aren't real
[5:13:57] <mdkcde> isn't the intel on konrad's bedroom?

[5:14:03] <PlumpPotatoRump> 'DUBAI IS YOURS'
[5:14:03] <jorniev> KEEEP PLAYING
[5:14:04] <+MrAtheGreat> When you reach Konrad's apartment go up the stairs on the right side and look on the desk for the intel
[5:14:06] <+BionoidLCR> how do you think they are real minh?
[5:14:07] <PlumpPotatoRump> huh?
[5:14:11] <KeystoneA1> they're fake
[5:14:11] <derap41> Spooky ghosts
[5:14:11] <+ConLin_Arts_> WHY would they salute you????
[5:14:12] <petwisk> Walker is already dead Minh
[5:14:14] <devil_may_cum_> They’re not real
[5:14:15] <PlumpPotatoRump> they are mind goblins
[5:14:15] <lilmac64> You've killed dozens of their fellows, and they're going to salute you?
[5:14:16] <+luigintbknss> It’s all in his head
[5:14:18] <Pappajimbo> 33rd all dead you killed them all
[5:14:18] <+jiggy_snipe> they aren't real, you won so they surrendered in your head
[5:14:19] <petwisk> Walker is in Hell
[5:14:23] <dukenux> He didnt'

[5:14:41] <+MrAtheGreat> When you reach Konrad's apartment go up the stairs on the right side and look on the desk for the intel @WoolieVersus
[5:14:42] <+kewlmyc> MINH STOP
[5:14:46] <+QueequegTheater> Woolie, fun fact: you can see a noose around Lugo's neck early on during a rappel section and Konrad's face on a bus in Chapter 1

[5:16:37] <%allups> it was u attacking them
[5:16:38] <%Alexandoas> woolieU
[5:16:40] <derap41> You had 1 early part where there were mistaken identity then you just went ham
[5:16:41] <+kewlmyc> Woolie got it
[5:16:41] <+QueequegTheater> "Konrad, shut up, I'm collecting shinies"
[5:16:44] <dukenux> There is no more intel, right?
[5:16:44] <+EternalFire9> I would assume the 33rd that's left were probably set up a base around the tower, because it's a big landmark.
[5:16:45] <coracor> .....
[5:16:47] <derap41> Its still a military HQ
[5:16:47] <Javthusiast> stop minh

[5:16:51] <+Mrthefro> ????
[5:16:52] <deadbrainpl> This is in direct contrast to both Kurz from Heart of Darkness and Apocalypse Now who go on a huge explanation in their last letter too. Because Konrad doesn't matter - it's all Walker.
[5:16:52] <HeroToxiko> it's a pretty good base
[5:16:52] <VidulaSaix> MINH WHAT
[5:16:53] <keyworthe> SHUT UP
[5:16:56] <+QueequegTheater> Minh is missing the forest for the trees

[5:17:30] <dukenux> nothing makes sense after you enter that tower
[5:17:30] <%Alexandoas> Minh could fall out of a boat and not find water

[5:17:34] <+admiral_of_crunch> NOW LIMP TOP IT
[5:17:35] <+Taglog7> Minh is Konrad
[5:17:36] <GoldeNOVA> The other endings are after shooting Konrad, btw
[5:17:36] <lilmac64> Mihn, if a man stormed your apartment with a gun and killed all your neighbors, would you meet him in the lobby and say "Nice shootin' man! You got us! Well done!"?
[5:17:38] <+jpipeman> They made you their king
[5:17:39] <keyworthe> IT ALL MAKES SENSE NOW
[5:17:39] <arkv01> minh you gotta be able to hear yourself, you sound ultra mad right now
[5:17:43] <+jpipeman> this is absurd
[5:17:46] <+MrAtheGreat> down and up

[5:18:23] <Solidnick18> FeelsGoodMan
[5:18:23] <+DreyfussFrost> @chesterr01 Did you see all the ending conditions? They all start with shooting Konrad, but you can surrender, resist and lose, or resist and win.
[5:18:24] <HeroToxiko> oh shit you're right
[5:18:26] <IndoorSitup> Minh is being a big Pepega right now.
[5:18:27] <+RealThiele> hes trying to make us gain Minhsight
[5:18:29] <%Irridium> He might think they're just what's left of the leadership of the 33rd
[5:18:29] <%allups> i missed all this shit
[5:18:30] <arkv01> GivePLZ
[5:18:31] <derap41> Konrad body was left here after he killed himself the US HQ was still close by why would they move
[5:18:32] <dukenux> i get minhs point, i just disagree
[5:18:32] <devil_may_cum_> I get what Minh is saying, he’s just wrong
[5:18:38] <+jaayro> All the fighting and soliders are real. You came in, and started shooting. The soldiers were acting in self-defence. Konrad was Walker's made up justification for the all the killing, but it turns out, he was dead from the start.
[5:18:39] <buffmurffy> damn, nice eye reggie
[5:18:40] <@chesterr01> @dreyfussfrost yup! working on it! :)
[5:18:42] <Medo3G> cause there's like 9
[5:18:43] <+QueequegTheater> Woolie is 100% right
[5:18:44] <+Xeno351> the ABANDONED building
[5:18:46] <derap41> The people doing the salute aren't real
[5:18:48] <CrabSlacks> those guys are super not real
[5:18:49] <keyworthe> this doesn't even take such a intracate conversation to understand THEY'RE NOT REAL CAUSE IT MAKES NO SENSE
[5:18:50] <Medo3G> and you clearly wanna go up there
[5:18:52] <Medo3G> so fuck it
[5:18:53] <dukenux> exactly
[5:18:54] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus go back to the elevator
[5:18:54] <Bunnykinght96> Yeah but walker didnt known he was dead
[5:18:55] <+DreyfussFrost> @chesterr01 SeemsGood
[5:18:59] <+unclekulikov> They also were unarmed.
[5:19:00] <PlumpPotatoRump> and why they salute too
[5:19:00] <Javthusiast> MindManners
[5:19:04] <dukenux> This is just Walker's "reward"

[5:19:21] <jorniev> oh god
[5:19:23] <VidulaSaix> Correct
[5:19:23] <KeystoneA1> It's their HQ, why would they abandon it
[5:19:26] <derap41> Woolie 100% right
[5:19:28] <%TheSniperJoe> The story is based on Heart of Darkness so...
[5:19:29] <+admiral_of_crunch> Is it possible to go back down the elevator? I never tried
[5:19:29] <+undercoverbarber> doodBait doodNo
[5:19:30] <+RealThiele> Storymachines, son
[5:19:31] <PlumpPotatoRump> bingo
[5:19:33] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Chat shut up let him explain
[5:19:34] <devil_may_cum_> @dukenux Exactly, a way for him to cope and justify all the shot he’s done
[5:19:35] <%The_Timo> Minh's feeble mind still won't get it, he can't learn lol no need to explain things to him
[5:19:36] <+AugustHaze> Woolie is super right
[5:19:37] <krabsan> Man woolie has way more patience than i would have with Minh
[5:19:37] <%allups> let him explain so minh can understand

[5:19:52] <Ganfur> we don't need spelling out

[5:20:02] <CrabSlacks> If you continue you will learn
[5:20:02] <zamzoph> Does Minh think everyone outside is not real too?
[5:20:06] <emroktheverdant> Minh what are you talking about?
[5:20:06] <+jiggy_snipe> it's not rational for them to protect a dead body
[5:20:07] <petwisk> this is going to be long
[5:20:11] <HeroToxiko> They were just in the shantytown base. thats why they were all fighting, The last group were just in walkers head

[5:27:26] <+chubbypencil> LMAO who would name their child Konrad while working on this game
[5:27:29] <deadbrainpl> Yaeger got stuck making Dead Island 2...and it's hard to tell what they're doing now
[5:27:32] <+DreyfussFrost> @allups Yeah, it was a franchise that basically went nowhere. They were second-rate Rainbow Six games.
[5:27:32] <+steelmorrigan> oh I'd herad they got shuttered, sorry
[5:27:35] <SolSwagGuy56> Chat raise your hand if you are real
[5:27:38] <derap41> Woolie these were like 1999 games
[5:27:43] <warmnoid> fucking spec ops secondaries
[5:27:44] <+RealThiele> konrad is john sheridans zombie
[5:27:45] <Prevot> TIL Spec Ops is apparently a franchise and not just this game
[5:27:46] <Torgue_1> Spec Ops was competing with Rainbow Six
[5:27:47] <%Alexandoas> t101LETS t101DO t101THIS
[5:27:47] <swack16> thye literally release spec ops games every year in the 90s
[5:27:54] <%blaccbird914> @deadbrainpl they recently made dreadnaught
[5:27:59] <irfan_> theres a good vid by raycevick about the game and its production
[5:28:00] <deadbrainpl> Oh right
[5:28:01] <petwisk> Yager is the Company did this game
[5:28:03] <Avalon_One> I may or may not be an illusion of your shattered psyche
[5:28:04] <jorniev> yager games has like 2 games in their belt
[5:28:06] <+unclekulikov> Overcoming the delusion
[5:28:10] <devil_may_cum_> Music is fantastic
[5:28:11] <+Toblo1> The suicide ending is more a denial of reality, TBH
[5:28:12] <+trialbyrespawn> so this game killed the franchise
[5:28:12] <Medo3G> weren't they doing dead island 2
[5:28:13] <+DreyfussFrost> The Line was made because the devs were trying to redefine Spec Ops' brand to make it relevant again.
[5:28:18] <Captain_Ragtag> Well there's 4 different endings
[5:28:19] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Ironically, the old Spec Ops games were the exact sort of rah rah go America fuck yeah games that The Line is directly criticizing
[5:28:22] <%allups> he dont always help people
[5:28:23] <+Toblo1> Because Walker is resorting to suicide to escape the guilt
[5:28:25] <%allups> we*
[5:28:27] <%jinking79> is this real
[5:28:27] <MrSparkle21> Didn't most people who made this game left shortly after this was released
[5:28:31] <jorniev> they WERE doing dead island 2
[5:28:34] <Quent0nius> there is no steam. we are watching nothing.
[5:28:41] <dukenux> The only reason this is a Spec Ops game, is because the franchise was lying around.
[5:28:45] <+Taglog7> What about Psi-Ops?
[5:28:49] <derap41> You talking bout Pat
[5:28:51] <derap41> ?
[5:28:54] <AnthroMetal> somebody say brink?
[5:28:54] <zamzoph> you do a Javert
[5:28:54] <algi80> I love how Nolan North was Walker
[5:29:01] <Klarrann3> Liam O'Brien :O
[5:29:01] <derap41> "You didn't Win1"
[5:29:01] <petwisk> @dreyfussfrost and sure they did since this mfing game is still talked to this day
[5:29:03] <+QueequegTheater> @Toblo1 Unless the game takes place in Walker's personal hell, in which case killing himself is him recognizing that he does not deserve redemption
[5:29:06] <%jinking79> Yep that is Pat
[5:29:08] <xxshadowxx416> so woolie how much to make you play gears
[5:29:08] <HeroToxiko> broken frameworks
[5:29:09] <+DreyfussFrost> Yeah, this game was an attempt to reboot Spec Ops, but they hid it too well.
[5:29:13] <+RealThiele> crazy talk
[5:29:14] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1222044563210145793?s=19
[5:29:17] <derap41> You Didn't Win
[5:29:26] <+QueequegTheater> MINH FILLS THE HOLES
[5:29:26] <%The_Timo> Out of your ass?
[5:29:30] <+QueequegTheater> Kreygasm
[5:29:33] <dukenux> yea
[5:29:36] <PlumpPotatoRump> i need to watch it
[5:29:37] <devil_may_cum_> I need more of these types of games
[5:29:40] <+DreyfussFrost> @petwisk Yes but unfortunately that doesn't translate to sales. Great game, failed reboot.
[5:29:42] <+undercoverbarber> Minh became Hokage when he was 8 Kappa
[5:29:42] <BallerSwagBro9k> THATS A GREAT MOVIE
[5:29:42] <+RealThiele> he tries to fill the hole from having his ass blown out
[5:29:42] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> yes
[5:29:44] <dukenux> It's a good mobie
[5:29:44] <HeroToxiko> shutter island aka, gut cry at theend
[5:29:57] <+QueequegTheater> Oh man it's just Jacob's Ladder meets Shutter Island
[5:30:00] <+freeizone> so good
[5:30:03] <krabsan> Oh man Shutter Island is so fucking good
[5:30:03] <Javthusiast> mr robot is great too
[5:30:05] <+captain_history> The ending to that movie is great because you can read it in more than one way.
[5:30:06] <DatAsuna> Shutter island did it better
[5:30:08] <petwisk> @dreyfussfrost really Sad this is a great game
[5:30:15] <+QueequegTheater> !uptime
[5:30:16] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 5 hours and 30 minutes
[5:30:18] <devil_may_cum_> Shutter island is godlike
[5:30:28] <HeroToxiko> @captain_history hard to read in heavy rain LUL
[5:30:31] <+QueequegTheater> !raffle
[5:30:35] <dukenux> Redefine the truth.
[5:30:39] <DedlokPM> Yager was at one time attached to make Dead Island 2 but Deep Silver took them off the project back in 2015. Since then they made Dreadnaughtfor PC & PS4 and The Cycle for PC Early Access
[5:30:41] <NotHereToStream> huey was a bitch
[5:30:44] <%jinking79> and ppl help on that lie
[5:30:57] <+htt0r1hnz0> Do y'all think that Leo denied knowing what it was on PURPOSE so he could get lobotimized?
[5:30:59] <+RealThiele> dreadnaught was ok, but not enough 3d space combat
[5:31:04] <deadbrainpl> Is Dreadnought any good? I doubt it has the same level of story as Spec Ops
[5:31:09] <derap41> There is a final step
[5:31:10] <dukenux> @htt0r1hnz0 yep
[5:31:11] <%allups> The cycle is pretty good
[5:31:13] <+Taglog7> Babydoll Kappa
[5:31:17] <+RealThiele> its a spaceship squad shooter
[5:31:20] <Reizie_Etherealm> Compartmentalization can help prevent cognitive dissonance but if you start putting things into the wrong compartment it all falls apart
[5:31:22] <derap41> It doesn't go out with a bang
[5:31:42] <jorniev> i hope woolie is good at shooters for this next part
[5:31:42] <+undercoverbarber> @Taglog7 Sweet Pea Kappa
[5:31:46] <Infinit_Phoenix> did i just walk into the credits?
[5:31:49] <Frostilk> That feeling when the people who made some of your favorite one-off games either burn out, shut down or quit the industry :-(
[5:31:51] <VidulaSaix> Nolan's fucking great
[5:31:56] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> he kills it
[5:31:58] <xxshadowxx416> halo
[5:31:58] <+MrRabbles> strong Nolan performance
[5:31:58] <BallerSwagBro9k> Hes thebest
[5:32:01] <NotHereToStream> bruh nolan north is very amazing
[5:32:02] <%allups> he's god like
[5:32:03] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> and this is his normal voice too
[5:32:05] <Solidnick18> Nolan is awesome
[5:32:07] <Avalon_One> The brain will do just about anything to reject consequences of it's actions
[5:32:08] <petwisk> this is his greatest hole
[5:32:13] <+theAncopro> very strong
[5:32:15] <+Taglog7> LUL BibleThump
[5:32:16] <devil_may_cum_> Amazing performance
[5:32:19] <IndoorSitup> @petwisk hole?
[5:32:20] <+Taglog7> KappaPride
[5:32:21] <+Toblo1> @WoolieVersus Nolan says this was his favorite role
[5:32:22] <derap41> They did the VO chronologically so by the end their voice was fucked
[5:32:23] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> like people call him action Drake man but dudes got range when hes allowed
[5:32:23] <ItsJustReiter> hole?
[5:32:24] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Fun fact, the writer of this co-wrote the single player campaign of EA's Star Wars Battlefront 2
[5:32:26] <petwisk> rolê*
[5:32:26] <alrobot2014> @chesterr01 not sure if you guys noticed it, but on the title screen at the end of the anthem throughout the game you can always hear the rotors of the helicopter
[5:32:28] <+RealThiele> nolan north is da man
[5:32:28] <DatAsuna> he got work forever before that
[5:32:29] <zamzoph> V I S C E R A L
[5:32:30] <petwisk> sorry
[5:32:30] <ItsJustReiter> Wow, how do you miss that?
[5:32:30] <Reizie_Etherealm> He fucking killed it dude. Or as he so eloquently put it KILL FUCKING CONFIRMED
[5:32:35] <DatAsuna> he's actually been in decline since
[5:32:41] <MayorRev> PogChamp
[5:32:42] <DatAsuna> at least in frequency
[5:32:42] <+RealThiele> its the most movie-like
[5:32:44] <+Toblo1> Its so fucking raw, its amazing
[5:32:50] <+Toblo1> Borderline *FERAL*
[5:32:52] <+ConLin_Arts_> woolieMIRIN
[5:32:55] <+steelmorrigan> he got to do a whole range of emotions
[5:32:55] <+MrAtheGreat> Because they said DONT do the NAthan drake voice
[5:32:57] <%allups> he actually gets to flex
[5:33:03] <derap41> So Woolie could you make this into a movie?
[5:33:05] <+DreyfussFrost> @chesterr01 Word is the voice directors threw out the first couple takes of every line, no matter how good they were, just to frustrate the actors and get them to drop the professionalism in their voices.
[5:33:05] <%DomPressesButtons> shoutout to Adams he was Kid from House Party!
[5:33:07] <HeroToxiko> Shutter island was different, you could see the entire movie as a summary of every time he ran through the scenario and then the ending as the moment he finally succeeded
[5:33:13] <%blaccbird914> This is the one game out of his entire catalog he wants people to play
[5:33:14] <petwisk> he crushed so hard in this game
[5:33:20] <+MrAtheGreat> TWO MORE TIMES
[5:33:22] <+QueequegTheater> Get that sniper wearing a green shirt with a failing marriage by the second red railing!
[5:33:24] <+MrAtheGreat> Depending
[5:33:25] <Kilborn119> im sure you can skip the credits
[5:33:26] <CrabSlacks> you can skip the credits
[5:33:27] <coracor> I think you can skip
[5:33:27] <derap41> True ending here
[5:33:28] <algi80> @WoolieVersus and the protag had to be a popular voice actor
[5:33:34] <krabsan> Man it sucks that this game didn't do well since it was marketed as a generic 3rd person shooter
[5:33:35] <HeroToxiko> here we goooooop
[5:33:37] <KeystoneA1> think you can skip
[5:33:38] <SolSwagGuy56> HERE WE GO
[5:33:41] <+QueequegTheater> Lugo was great
[5:33:41] <derap41> @coracor didn't want to risk it
[5:33:42] <+steelmorrigan> now decide
[5:33:42] <+MrAtheGreat> HERE WE GO
[5:33:42] <devil_may_cum_> You can skip the next ones
[5:33:43] <Medo3G> are you sure you can't?
[5:33:43] <BallerSwagBro9k> theres 3 more endings but you dont need to see the credits
[5:33:43] <Avalon_One> Most of this cast did an amazing job tbh
[5:33:44] <+htt0r1hnz0> @QueequegTheater His son JUST got out of chemotherapy!
[5:33:44] <i_heart_gaming> everyone in this game was solid
[5:33:46] <+MrAtheGreat> FORK IN THE ROAD
[5:33:48] <CrabSlacks> but checkpoint
[5:33:49] <%TheSniperJoe> Voice Over Artists are often restricted by the scope of the project, time, money, add either of those and you can get some INSANE performances out of your actors.
[5:33:50] <%allups> way better then it had any right to be
[5:33:52] <+steelmorrigan> DECIDE
[5:33:54] <buffmurffy> i feel like you can skip the credits, i dont know what chat was talking about
[5:33:54] <MrSparkle21> There are two options
[5:33:55] <+RealThiele> the multiplayer tried to take the spotlight in ads if i remeber correctly
[5:33:59] <derap41> Will Woolie do it
[5:34:00] <+MrAtheGreat> eyyyy America
[5:34:01] <CursedNobleman> theres no way woolie can do a genocide run LUL
[5:34:03] <+Piemen99> Im expecting dead everywhere

[5:49:26] <IndoorSitup> REMEMBER BACK IN
[5:49:27] <juxtest> It is hard
[5:49:28] <derap41> The solid wall on the left side
[5:49:28] <keyworthe> REMEMBER IT WOOLIE
[5:49:29] <%gatorafan> Get into Fighting games in 10 minutes :)
[5:49:30] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus For what it's worth, aiming out of the side is safer than over the top
[5:49:30] <+admiral_of_crunch> Bad time
[5:49:33] <keyworthe> REMEMBER THE FUCKING KABUL
[5:49:34] <hntronium> MEMBER
[5:49:34] <+DreyfussFrost> Maybe take more of them out before THEY get to cover?
[5:49:34] <mrsnowman777> youtube time
[5:49:34] <algi80> try with a mouse Kappa
[5:49:34] <%DensityD> this is hard
[5:49:35] <deadbrainpl> This is the final boss
[5:49:36] <bevyrage> @trianglehat the controls are sluggish and the cover is inconsistent. the game honestly plays pretty bad for a 3rd person shooter, given how smooth gears of war played in comparison
[5:49:37] <Solidnick18> big hard
[5:49:37] <Novillion> maybe dont vault into the line of fire?
[5:49:37] <Kilborn119> especially with a controller
[5:49:38] <+steelmorrigan> It's the hardest fight in the game
[5:49:38] <TigerClaws12> put bitch mode on Kappa
[5:49:39] <mirum> REMEMBER BAC-
[5:49:41] <Klarrann3> abuse the slow motion
[5:49:41] <%LordSDB> well this is quite the line
[5:49:41] <thetrashman_sc> this is actually hard
[5:49:41] <+QueequegTheater> This is legitimately tough
[5:49:41] <krabsan> DO YOU REMEMBER?
[5:49:42] <%allups> vaulting over cover exposes ur whole body its not good to do
[5:49:43] <+kewlmyc> It's the hardest fight in the game
[5:49:44] <+MrAtheGreat> @WoolieVersus What solidus said
[5:49:44] <%Louie_Salmon> I mean, it is a little
[5:49:44] <startstoprepeat> this is genocide run
[5:49:47] <+chubbypencil> nah this shit is rodan hidden boss level shit
[5:49:47] <OldManDeckardCain> it's almost as hard as that train mission in san andreas Kappa
[5:49:48] <krabsan> THE 21 FIRST DAY
[5:49:48] <Bunnykinght96> It a one shot kill
[5:49:48] <alrobot2014> this is legitimately the hardest part
[5:49:49] <+steelmorrigan> because the lft is full of death
[5:49:49] <derap41> Look left theres a solid block

[5:50:37] <+MrAtheGreat> Kill the grenadier wools
[5:50:38] <derap41> you can kill 2 with the first shot
[5:50:38] <SilentPredator03> stay in cover until you're fully healed
[5:50:38] <krabsan> This is Undertale genocide
[5:50:38] <%LordSDB> @woolieversus when you first shoot you can get the guy behind him if you keep shooting
[5:50:40] <Medo3G> then shoot the left guy first?
[5:50:40] <alrobot2014> wait you can shoot through their cover too
[5:50:41] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus That strat was 100% working
[5:50:42] <bevyrage> if you kill the guys on the left they can't hurt you though.
[5:50:43] <+admiral_of_crunch> @WoolieVersus Make sure to lean out of cover from the side to shrink your hitbox
[5:50:44] <oceanmatt> then shoot the far left guys first

[6:08:58] <+RealThiele> i member
[6:08:59] <Reizie_Etherealm> Sam, we've got a body and we need you to deliver it to the incinerator post haste
[6:09:01] <derap41> Woolie which ending did you prefer ?
[6:09:07] <alrobot2014> it was definitely hard
[6:09:09] <dukenux> @RealThiele i member Kabul
[6:09:12] <+RealThiele> LUL
[6:09:16] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Woolie, take it from someone who grew up on Halo and Gears, this game is legitimately HARD
[6:09:17] <Solidnick18> feel like doing more of these then
[6:09:18] <VidulaSaix> @WoolieVersus Good first LP venture outside of your usual I take it?
[6:09:24] <+Taglog7> It was hard KappaPride
[6:09:26] <%blaccbird914> this game tries to punish you to push the point
[6:09:29] <OldOnyx> blind
[6:09:31] <OldOnyx> gire
[6:09:35] <hntronium> Know when to hold them, know when to fold them
[6:09:35] <OldOnyx> fire even
[6:09:38] <BimboBagging> What are you guys' canon ending? @woolieversus
[6:09:40] <hntronium> Know when to walk away
[6:09:41] <+RealThiele> Lugo early on with his "Anime down"
[6:09:43] <hntronium> Know when to run
[6:09:46] <+jpipeman> This game is definitely messy, even for cover shooters
[6:09:51] <%DesertPenguin> How long ago did they finish?
[6:09:51] <%allups> if he's still worried about kabul after all that wtf happened in kabul
[6:09:57] <jorniev> IT IS HARD
[6:10:00] <gunsrlove> ..What, no it isnt
[6:10:00] <Reizie_Etherealm> That last segment with the 3 grenades reminds me of Call of Duty World at War on veteran
[6:10:01] <+BionoidLCR> KABUL
[6:10:03] <+QueequegTheater> And still has not pronounced that correctly even once
[6:10:06] <IndoorSitup> IT FEELS LIKE WAR
[6:10:06] <rumuloh> It really isn't
[6:10:10] <%allups> its harb but good
[6:10:12] <devil_may_cum_> You just suck
[6:10:13] <+QueequegTheater> In like three years man
[6:10:14] <hntronium> Take it from some other guy who played a bunch of CoD, its not that hard
[6:10:16] <%allups> hard*
[6:10:26] <%Exiliator> Streamlabs doesnt let me donate again :(
[6:10:26] <derap41> Which ending was best
[6:10:27] <+RealThiele> it is rigid, a turgid game of stiff difficulty
[6:10:39] <VidulaSaix> Oh god I forgot 3rd Birthday happened LUL
[6:10:45] <Solidnick18> ugh
[6:10:47] <+Mrthefro> LUL
[6:10:50] <masterfire23> i find shooters much harder with controller
[6:10:54] <+MrRabbles> Minh and Reggie made it
[6:10:55] <+BionoidLCR> @QueequegTheater its not even close to difficult lol
[6:10:58] <alrobot2014> i erased 3rd birthday from my memory thanks
[6:10:59] <+RealThiele> we all had to survive minh being wrong
[6:11:00] <%blaccbird914> I forgot the 3rd birthday was a thing
[6:11:06] <VidulaSaix> Fair enough
