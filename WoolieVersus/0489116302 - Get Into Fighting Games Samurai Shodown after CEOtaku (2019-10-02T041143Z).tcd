[0:03:57] <Chatterbox1991> MrDestructoid500 You;ve talked a bit lately about Open World games as a concept on the podcast; how it doesn't really grab you and how you don't see it as a preferable medium for story telling compared to a Kojima Hallway; i would argue that if you want a primer on open world story telling that you should check out RDR1; its way more focus and approachable as an open world than you think and is a masterclass in story telling, it might even be worth a quick look or lp; very much worth your time!

[0:55:47] <+floralkami> Woolie about to get smack around by a child
[0:55:48] <+LordSDB> He reminds me of that kid Shishio Makoto took in
[0:55:49] <rad_dude123465> HOLD DAT BUTTON
[0:56:02] <%GabeSweetMan> wut
[0:56:03] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[0:56:05] <%jinking79> he's holding it for 80 sec
[0:56:06] <Triplicat> samsho is the kind of game where you can press the button and immediately tell you fucked up and watch yourself slowly get fucked up in the next 1-3 seconds
[0:56:09] <%thetrashman_sc> Darli gonna ara ara this shota
[0:56:10] <Guntanks_in_Space> yeah you could do that
[0:56:10] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> what
[0:56:14] <zenith0111> What?
[0:56:16] <+gooniekorn> They took out holding it at the character select
[0:56:20] <+ElectricFoxLex> Wrong, that's 5SP, not in this
[0:56:23] <%GabeSweetMan> That's DUMB! Why is it like that?!
[0:56:29] <tigerfang86> OH SHIT
[0:56:35] <Guntanks_in_Space> yeah no more hold on character select, but he can still switch the hold button
[0:56:38] <+LordSDB> Seta Sōjirō is his name
[0:56:39] <Guntanks_in_Space> THERE IT IS
[0:56:40] <arcforged> DEAT
[0:56:48] <+floralkami> @GabeSweetMan what you mean? That's tactics
[0:56:50] <%gatorafan> Shizumaru is for wholesome hand holding with Rimururu VoHiYo
[0:56:52] <mor3gan> wait thats a DUDE
[0:57:03] <tigerfang86> M Y G
[0:57:07] <%thetrashman_sc> ARA ARA HIM WOOLIE
[0:57:11] <Guntanks_in_Space> now the character select charge TAP was a bug in SSVSP and was totally unintended, but it works
[0:57:12] <Admiral_PopnFresh> so any time Shizu isn't moving, assume he's charging
[0:57:13] <rosemon5001> just joined who is that next to reggie?
[0:57:13] <zenith0111> Is he saying magic?
[0:57:24] <Guntanks_in_Space> Lord Jimmy Bones, also a Canadian Fighting Game Streamer
[0:57:25] <%GabeSweetMan> @floralkami It's more specifically the ability to charge before the match has even started.
[0:57:29] <Guntanks_in_Space> and 2nd placer at CEOTaku
[0:57:32] <+OkamiDude15> darli gonna drain the life force outta this young lad
[0:57:33] <%GabeSweetMan> That's nuts to me.

[0:58:23] <tigerfang86> RAISE YOUR SHIELD
[0:58:28] <rad_dude123465> @gabesweetman he can’t charge during character selection in this game (in the earlier games he can) so it’s not as ridiculous as you might think
[0:58:29] <Guntanks_in_Space> don't drop your shield!
[0:58:30] <zenith0111> Not gonna lie I wish this game looked better
[0:58:31] <tigerfang86> pull the shield UP woolie
[0:58:33] <Serge_12> Who is the GUEST?
[0:58:34] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> That looks really stupid, please tell me there's a counter
[0:58:39] <%Wool> block
[0:58:48] <+floralkami> @GabeSweetMan in my opinion, not saying it's right, but i see it as someone entering the match already within a stance.
[0:58:50] <Guntanks_in_Space> you have to almost always expect him to have a Charge ready
[0:58:58] <Guntanks_in_Space> better pay attention to what button he ain't pressing
[0:59:02] <ManOfReason> nice
[0:59:04] <Guntanks_in_Space> at least, that's what i remember lol
[0:59:04] <%thetrashman_sc> but why
[0:59:07] <%GingaNZ> explain yourself
[0:59:10] <FuqBoiSlim> SeemsGood
[0:59:10] <%GabeSweetMan> @rad_dude123465 Ah gotcha. By the way Reggie was describing it sounded super busted.
[0:59:15] <Guntanks_in_Space> and now the Ara Ara happens
[0:59:18] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @Serge_12 Lord Jimmy Bones apparently
[0:59:38] <+floralkami> @GabeSweetMan plus, it's a risk/reward, giving up a button for potential high damge
[0:59:45] <Serge_12> OMG Jimmy Bones!!!! awesome!
[0:59:49] <Guntanks_in_Space> Woolie would Dropkick a Kid to not drown in tournament pools
