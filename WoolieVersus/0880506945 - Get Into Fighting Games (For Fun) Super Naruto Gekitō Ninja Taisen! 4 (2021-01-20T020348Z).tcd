[0:08:42] <%theparisreview> wait, there is a real Naruto fighter?
[0:08:43] <+Mendin> Show us that case Wooli
[0:08:43] <+Battletankbob> Gekitou Ninja Taisen series may not be as pretty, but is way more fun and a better game imo
[0:08:44] <+TheotherKristian> Storm? Is it appraoching?
[0:08:45] <odiemikes> mirror cube!
[0:08:45] <+Mendin> YESYEYEYEYEEYE

[0:08:51] <%JustYudha> Damn he had that ready
[0:08:52] <+askalta> of i remember
[0:08:53] <+Mendin> AN OG
[0:08:54] <WackyModder84> Gekitou Ninja Taisen Special is arguably better than 4
[0:08:54] <Solidnick18> ooooh clash of ninja
[0:08:55] <%kingkaito1123> The OGs are better than Ultimate Ninja Storm
[0:08:56] <@Menitta> I played 2 a shit ton
[0:08:59] <Darren716> LUL
[0:08:59] <%RyTYoung> yo yo yo YO

[0:09:13] <Solidnick18> that game was great
[0:09:14] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[0:09:14] <GeltonZ> This is the game that (sadly) put Eighting on the map. Bloody Roar never took off so watered down Bloody Roar with Naruto characters saved fighting games.
[0:09:15] <%RadicalWeegee> adorable Smol packaging
[0:09:16] <+Battletankbob> hellyea i imported GNT3 then 4 when it released
[0:09:26] <%yusefHD> @GeltonZ this
[0:09:30] <%RyTYoung> WTF
[0:09:30] <inkandamber> Naruto candy can't be a good thing.
[0:09:34] <scrumbotime> Naruto, I'm on my way because I'm hallucinating from eating expired candy.
[0:09:35] <%RyTYoung> THATS COOL
[0:09:35] <GrimEnigma> did it come with hashirama cells?
[0:09:42] <@Menitta> The GBA adapter disc case is the same
[0:09:43] <+Psycosis> it looks so small
[0:09:46] <odiemikes> old ps2 cases
[0:09:49] <dundunsun> Didn’t deny wearing it proudly
[0:09:49] <%RadicalWeegee> I really want to get some of them There cute and look nicer imo
[0:09:52] <+jiggy_snipe> that looks better tbh
[0:09:53] <jamox1> It would now @grimenigma
[0:09:55] <WeaponX3521> Man I miss this series
[0:09:58] <turbofolk> Well back in the day
[0:10:03] <Darren716> Wait is the Japanese GC box the same as the Switch box?
[0:10:06] <@Menitta> I need a japanese copy of Mario Sunshine
[0:10:10] <turbofolk> @WeaponX3521 No you don't
[0:10:12] <+LordCasante> dumb question: is this the one that came out before "Rasengan" was translated and it's just called "power strike" or is that a different one?
[0:10:14] <GrimEnigma> @jamox1 LUL
[0:10:14] <GeltonZ> @Darren716 Nope
[0:10:19] <andre11dr> It's so funny to me how popular Naruto got despite its undeniable HxH And Yu Yu Hakusho rip offnes
[0:10:20] <+squidlord482> I was gonna go shopping but I’m behind schedule so now I can watch the stream that I wait!
[0:10:20] <+Battletankbob> I didn't know anyone cool even knew about this series
[0:10:21] <%kingkaito1123> That’s the same boxing for Yakuza games

[0:10:28] <Darren716> Looked about the samish size
[0:10:30] <WeaponX3521> @turbofolk yes I do 😭
[0:10:32] <@Menitta> If you ever had a Game Boy Advanced player on your gamecube, its the same as that
[0:10:36] <Super_Voltekka> Eighting also made shmups
[0:10:38] <inkandamber> Tomy used to make train sets...Unless we had a different Tomy in the UK.
[0:10:44] <Solidnick18> LUL
[0:10:46] <Darren716> First?
[0:10:49] <GeltonZ> @Darren716 Nah, Japanese GC boxes are smaller and thicker than Switch boxes.

[0:12:10] <niddron> Man is perpetually stuck in a battle between being cring or based

[0:14:50] <%yusefHD> Oh my god it was called revolution not because of the innovation, but because you can rotate the controller
[0:14:51] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Don't forget the Samurai Naruto game!
[0:14:52] <odiemikes> woolie stop
[0:14:52] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Woolie is cursed with arcane knowledge
[0:14:57] <dragonify_> Revolution 1 was just GNT3 for Amercians
[0:14:57] <%yusefHD> fuck
[0:14:59] <+Battletankbob> modded my wii just to play the wii imports
[0:15:02] <majinken> Special was the final game
[0:15:04] <Darren716> Is this a Zombi situation?
[0:15:16] <GeltonZ> The Wii ones still use Gamecube controllers. They're pretty much the same games.
[0:15:18] <GrimEnigma> Naruto get ninja Tooshie
[0:15:21] <+BigBlackBankai> Then they have Samurai Dragon Lightsaber Naruto and Sasuke.
[0:15:22] <+squidlord482> There’s no chart because Naruto games aren’t as good as Kirby you play the Ultimate Ninja Storm Games (All 4) and that’s it
[0:15:29] <@Menitta> I remember playing a toooon of Revolution 3
[0:15:33] <%kingkaito1123> Brooo if Harada and his team ever make a full Tekken Style Naruto game, I’m buying it day one
[0:15:36] <andre11dr> With one was the Dragon one,i remember that one being atrocious
[0:15:42] <MyNameIsRasus> this layout is way better
[0:15:46] <GeltonZ> @squidlord482 Then you have already failed because GNT are the actually good fighting games.
[0:15:50] <odiemikes> @squidlord482 fair
[0:15:54] <%Theycallmenerf> Theycallmenerf subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months!
[0:16:03] <%RadicalWeegee> When most kids started watching
[0:16:12] <+squidlord482> That’s fair GNT is fun
[0:16:15] <turbofolk> So 2002-2005?
[0:16:21] <+Battletankbob> yeah clash and rev came out around the toonami runs arcs
[0:16:21] <%Theycallmenerf> Theycallmenerf subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months!
[0:16:27] <@Solidus_113> Ultimate Ninja
[0:16:29] <andre11dr> This is Retrieval Arc right?
[0:16:30] <@Solidus_113> no storm
[0:16:33] <Dante_Namikaze1> Yeah, Uzumaki Chronicles was affected by that the akatsuki were supposed to show up in that first game but when the game released in America the akatsuki still had a few weeks before they were introduced so they were just cut out of the game
[0:16:36] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Ultimate Ninja
[0:16:38] <Viktor616> Ultimate Ninja yeah
[0:16:44] <+MajorCrasher> LUL
[0:16:45] <+squidlord482> Toonami is STILL RUNNING SHIPPUDEN
[0:16:45] <Viktor616> Smash Bros
[0:16:46] <DreamCancel01> what is this make out cam set up
[0:16:51] <+squidlord482> It’s nuts
[0:16:51] <redrins> nah they were a weird inbetween
[0:16:52] <@Menitta> Was Revolution 2 not GNT4 though GNT3 was Rev 1
[0:16:59] <+Battletankbob> very bland smash clones
[0:17:10] <+Mendin> Rev1 was GNTEX1
[0:17:10] <deafmelone> 2d fighting game
[0:17:13] <%kingkaito1123> Oof
[0:17:17] <%kingkaito1123> That’s no good
[0:17:17] <@Menitta> Oooh ok
[0:17:18] <@Solidus_113> Ultimate Ninja 3 had some really gross infinites
[0:17:19] <+Mendin> Which came after GNT4 butwasnt
[0:17:20] <+Will9099> yo sick new camera angles
[0:17:23] <%gatorafan> Money: ON
[0:17:27] <GeltonZ> @Menitta I think Revolution 2 was US rexlusive. I know one of the Wii ones is US exclusive.
[0:17:27] <Dante_Namikaze1> and with Ultimate Ninja 3 the first movie villain was supposed to be in but the movie wasn't out yet then a week later the movie came out in english
[0:17:30] <Arek_1> Not a Smash clone... An Onimusha Blade Warriors clone. LUL
[0:17:36] <turbofolk> Remember that Naruto game where they hunted Dragons and everyone was in special armor get ups?
[0:17:42] <scrublord009> has woolie played Hyper DBZ?
[0:17:45] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Yeah, back then the Fourth Hokage had a game-original Super.
[0:17:47] <%yusefHD> This game specifically gives me such nostalgia, I'm praying the intro gets to play out.
[0:17:49] <+Mendin> The Rev/EX series went 1-3 and t hen there was EX Special
[0:17:53] <andre11dr> Don't forget Broken Bond
[0:17:53] <@Menitta> I bet it was Rev 2 because Rev 2 has a weird ass filler story with a dude who had gun hands
[0:18:05] <WadeGaming626> UN5 was the LAST naruto game i had before falling off for a decade. That game is worth a replay for me
[0:18:06] <+squidlord482> We need 8ing to do another one
[0:18:07] <odiemikes> Woolie, would you like to play Naruto Fighting Games? "Sure, but first: D E E P E S T L O R E"
[0:18:10] <andre11dr> I sure forgot
[0:18:17] <@Menitta> I'm scared because I can easily see myself ebaying a copy of GNT4
[0:18:24] <%krispen_wa> 10 year old me loved Narultimate heroes way more because i thought traditional fighting games sucked
[0:18:32] <Dante_Namikaze1> But the story mode and supers were way better than GNT
[0:18:34] <%Theycallmenerf> Is Madara a character I can play as?
[0:18:35] <@Solidus_113> There's button combos, spin the stick, and mash button
[0:18:36] <%krispen_wa> i stil think traditional fighting games suck tbf
[0:18:50] <%yusefHD> @krispen_wa sir
[0:19:00] <%0rond> oh they fixed the cameras, thank god. @WoolieVersus mad appreciated
[0:19:03] <odiemikes> @krispen_wa i can't play em but Woolie and others made me love em from a design perpsective
[0:19:10] <turbofolk> @krispen_wa Respectfull viewpoint
[0:19:16] <Dante_Namikaze1> I'm still mad that Ultimate Ninja 5 never came out in the west
[0:19:18] <@Solidus_113> I still have my copy of Ultimate Ninja 3. It's fun
[0:19:18] <Sporkgasm> yep
[0:19:20] <%0rond> it even frames the "vs" in the middle it's so good
[0:19:34] <niddron> you guys see korone playing Sonic and googling "sonic and Amy" only to be immediately confronted by filth?
[0:19:36] <+Battletankbob> woolie knows whats up
[0:19:36] <odd_slater> I just noticed Ino staring at Reggie LMAOOOOO

[0:21:16] <niddron> @rytyoung sonic demands desecration
[0:21:22] <+paladinstarbuster> NEH JI
[0:21:25] <ELFucilaNeroIV> I like this split camera VN setup
[0:21:27] <deafmelone> Shikamaru’s lvl 3 had a jojo reference in narultimate hero
[0:21:32] <landkit> oh i see. That is two cameras
[0:21:38] <mikewwm98> Nah, Neji had Air Palms
[0:21:40] <%0rond> I still can't with narutimate hero

[0:21:45] <%kingkaito1123> So Cyberconnect is mostly for amazing world designs more than the action itself, basically?
[0:21:48] <Dante_Namikaze1> it was 364 Plams
[0:21:50] <Deimos002> More like, Meh-ji CoolCat
[0:21:54] <+BigBlackBankai> 1080 Snowboarding Palms
[0:21:56] <@Solidus_113> They put fucking Green Beast in Ultimate Ninja 3. Naruto in Guy and Lee's suit
[0:22:00] <%RyTYoung> @niddron desecration is sonics middle name
[0:22:03] <%0rond> @kingkaito1123 also just really high quality 3D anime style
[0:22:19] <+Mendin> The dark timeline
[0:22:20] <%0rond> some of those storm qtes are incredible
[0:22:20] <Sporkgasm> i'm still bitter ninja storm got to keep going instead of those ubisoft naruto games
[0:22:23] <+squidlord482> I maintain we need a new Boruto era only fighting game
[0:22:25] <redrins> actually no, narutimate hero went up to shippuden and storm was a reboot
[0:22:26] <%kingkaito1123> @0rond oh I see
[0:22:29] <@Menitta> there was one GNT in Shippuden
[0:22:35] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Naruttimate did have like 2 shippuden games
[0:22:44] <Dante_Namikaze1> No, they went to Shippuden for two games and a PSP game then they did storm one with part one Naruto and then they started going with Shippuden with storm two and Beyond

[0:22:52] <odiemikes> shock-ra wools
[0:22:57] <%krispen_wa> AAAAAAAAHHHHH
[0:23:00] <%0rond> @redrins I think they went concurently, storm was OG naruto but narutiamte hero went up to shippuden
[0:23:01] <dragonify_> @redrins Storm 1 wasn't Shippuden lol
[0:23:07] <Viktor616> Narutimate Hero 4 5 were shippuden
[0:23:11] <CyrusVGZ> Ultimate Ninja Storm is 3D Marvel.
[0:23:19] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> geezus chat ya'll nitpicking a bit lmao
[0:23:22] <+Mendin> I remember jamming Hiruko (true Sasori was a separate character)
[0:23:23] <+Battletankbob> those were so boring but pretty. shame those series got all the attention
[0:23:29] <redrins> @dragonify_ thats what I said
[0:23:39] <Dante_Namikaze1> @meta_yoroitoshi it's not nitpicking when they made three games
[0:23:48] <%Klefth> Ooh, they went and changed the camera setup again
[0:23:51] <GeltonZ> @WoolieVersus The Wii games still support Gamecube controllers and are designed for them.
[0:24:00] <WadeGaming626> But UN4 had like it's own adventure mode with an original story which was cool.
[0:24:02] <+squidlord482> Yeah Ultimate Ninja Storm 1 was all of Part 1 and then 2 forward is Shippuden
[0:24:05] <odiemikes> oh nvm im the idiot, it is Chak ra
[0:24:09] <%0rond> I recall some of the narutimate hero ults being crazy hard to land
[0:24:11] <%KeiganOfAstora> why camera change?
[0:24:14] <deafmelone> Clash of Ninja has awesome music
[0:24:16] <ELFucilaNeroIV> A very dedicated community
[0:24:24] <%yusefHD> In Toronto, we'd run to the chinatown centre to where the bootleg games are on the 2nd floor, and behind a bubble tea shop there was a bootleg game arcade with imported games. Gekito was pretty much always in use. So many damn good memories.
[0:24:28] <andre11dr> The true believers
[0:24:31] <Dave_VD> What
[0:24:32] <%yusefHD> fuckin a.
[0:24:33] <@Menitta> Wait is there gonna be online play today
[0:24:33] <nfsman34> GNT1-4 are part 1 naruto EX1-3 and Special are Shippuden Rev 1 is GNT3, but in english. Rev 2 and 3 are filler, with Rev 2 being Part 1 and Rev 3 being Shippuden.
[0:24:36] <rosemon5001> dicLit dicLit dicLit
[0:24:38] <turbofolk> People that were frozen in time of that era of 2002-2006
[0:24:48] <%gatorafan> Competitive Naruto PogChamp
[0:24:59] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> Oh wow that's nuts
[0:25:00] <%KeiganOfAstora> This camera setup is weird. They're on the same freakin' couch
[0:25:03] <%RyTYoung> @keiganofastora To make use of the camera tech that Woolie hasn't used effectively, it also makes it clearer to see both Reggie and Woolie
[0:25:10] <+squidlord482> Super Naruto Guilty Gear Clash of Xrd Rev 4 when
[0:25:12] <fangovafang> wat up yall LuvPeekL
[0:25:14] <majinken> Super CON
[0:25:16] <%KeiganOfAstora> I mean, they're bigger now but it's certainly weird
[0:25:19] <nfsman34> GNT4 and Rev 3 are the 2 major Competative GNT games, just so people know.
[0:25:20] <%RyTYoung> instead of a zoomed out shot of the two of them on the couch
[0:25:22] <%yusefHD> @squidlord482 Accent Core +
[0:25:23] <%kingkaito1123> So Gekito Ninja Taisen is like Platinum games of the Franchise
[0:25:29] <CyrusVGZ> Woolie forgot about Battle Stadium DON Kappa
[0:25:29] <@Menitta> 2v2 was in Revolution
[0:25:36] <turbofolk> The FGC sure is full of weirdoes
[0:25:36] <%KeiganOfAstora> Maybe they could sit closer lol
[0:25:43] <+squidlord482> @yusefhd Starring Magneto from the MvC series
[0:25:46] <+Mesoian> Oooh GNT4
[0:25:46] <Dave_VD> This should be good clean anime nostalgia fun
[0:25:47] <bigshedman> Loving this visual novel camera setup
[0:25:50] <%yusefHD> LUL
[0:25:53] <%RyTYoung> @keiganofastora Do you want them to kiss? LUL
[0:25:54] <turbofolk> Amen woolie
[0:25:58] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> @KeiganOfAstora time for sitting on laps
[0:26:03] <+Mesoian> Probing the heyday of actually good naruto games
[0:26:11] <+squidlord482> This is a drake and Josh intro
[0:26:11] <hassanico2> lol the reflection in Reggie's side of the screen LUL
[0:26:16] <hassanico2> I can see the game LUL
[0:26:16] <MyNameIsRasus> ""comfort Reggie" "refuse"
[0:26:18] <%yusefHD> @WoolieVersus you're pretty much asking for someone on Twitter to make a dating sim edit to this layout btw. I won't do it, but LUL
[0:26:19] <crowned_martian> wait how long has this been going
[0:26:26] <Durendal35> this woolie vs reggie camera is great
[0:26:26] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Cyberconnect did Jojo
[0:26:37] <%RyTYoung> @squidlord482 I NEVER THOUGHT THAT IT'D BE SO SIMPLE BUT
[0:26:38] <crowned_martian> also this set up looks kinda neck cramp inducing.
[0:26:43] <rosemon5001> the naruto smash games had cool beam battles if attacks of same lvl hit at the right time
[0:26:46] <Solidnick18> hmmm
[0:26:54] <%RadicalWeegee> psaHoldon psaHoldon
[0:26:55] <WeaponX3521> Cyberconnect pulled an orochimaru
[0:26:57] <J0j0nes> HERE COMES THE HOT TAKE!
[0:26:58] <hassanico2> huh, didn't know that
[0:26:58] <%yusefHD> Someone summon Max
[0:27:02] <%krispen_wa> BURN THE WOOLIE
[0:27:03] <+BigBlackBankai> REEEEEEE
[0:27:08] <%Triforce505> WHAT?!
[0:27:09] <MutedMimic> crumpetCrump
[0:27:11] <turbofolk> Who fucking cares about Asuras wrath anymore
[0:27:12] <Viktor616> Asura's Wrath is barely a game
[0:27:13] <+Deko_> jojo eyes of heaven?
[0:27:14] <%CaptainPileDriver> sup crew
[0:27:14] <+Mendin> Asura's Wrath is very stylish but the game itself is kinda shitty, yes
[0:27:14] <%yusefHD> It's heavy rain, but faster LUL
[0:27:15] <fangovafang> @yusefhd LUL LUL
[0:27:20] <GeltonZ> Asura's Wrath is my favorite movie of all time, I really wish they'd make a game out of it.
[0:27:20] <andre11dr> PAY FOR THE REAL ENDING MOTHERFUCKERS @woolieversus
[0:27:20] <+SixMillionDollarGamer> Damn, did not see that hot take coming
[0:27:23] <ZeeJiggle> Asura's Wrath is a good anime to watch.
[0:27:27] <Dante_Namikaze1> Asura'a Wrath isn't a game
[0:27:28] <%RadicalWeegee> it was missing that little extra something
[0:27:29] <hassanico2> Was gonna mention David Cage myself
[0:27:35] <crowned_martian> OH NO not woolies hot take. "I don't like thing but wowie it's just oike Guraan Lagaan!"
[0:27:40] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> lmao @yusefHD that's a perfect analogy
[0:27:49] <redrins> play the dot hack games, those are bomb
[0:27:51] <%CaptainPileDriver> they make things visually beautiful, and woolie is 100% correct
[0:27:53] <%yusefHD> LUL facts though
[0:27:56] <hassanico2> Narutimate is such a gross word
[0:28:02] <%Jashter18> And Woolie is wrong and we move on
[0:28:04] <+Mesoian> It's a super gross word
[0:28:04] <Viktor616> Yeah the dothack games are the exception
[0:28:10] <+Mesoian> But those games were so good though
[0:28:11] <ELFucilaNeroIV> CC2's Demon Slayer game...
[0:28:12] <majinken> that game was the shit the doc though was alright
[0:28:13] <%kyh9> Dot Hack IMOQ is good tho
[0:28:18] <%yusefHD> Narutimate sounds like a cleaning solution lmfaoo
[0:28:27] <+Mesoian> NH3 and 4 are so amazin
[0:28:33] <%kyh9> Don't talk down about the Dot Hack series

[0:36:56] <@akuda_bar> i keep expecting a ring-out
[0:36:56] <%yusefHD> No SFX. Only bird.
[0:37:00] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Please tell me they still have the 3-Way deadlock stage in this game
[0:37:01] <+askalta> Didn't this game have a sequel? i think thats the one i remember
[0:37:04] <%AlteisenReiseZ> That's the best song
[0:37:05] <%aogman> CAWWWW
[0:37:10] <masterfire23> @dante_namikaze1 ok not underrated but underutilized
[0:37:18] <majinken> @alteisenreisez yup
[0:37:21] <GeltonZ> @askalta This game has a LOT of sequels. This is the 4th one.
[0:37:27] <brutalmoon2> The no-sfx is a bug, reset the game later
[0:37:35] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @majinken dnoGEESE
[0:37:44] <Dante_Namikaze1> @masterfire23 yes he was but underrated whenever people talk about Naruto they will always go to that Lee versus gar a fight and once you hear it to me times it's no longer as cool
[0:37:51] <deafmelone> Haku’s mixtape in this game is fire lol
[0:37:55] <majinken> @alteisenreisez best song was the rooftop of the exams

[0:38:12] <turbofolk> @WoolieVersus Reset the game?
[0:38:22] <ELFucilaNeroIV> it's most likely a sound bug
[0:38:22] <%yusefHD> If you reset the game, play the intro please, it's hype as shit
[0:38:25] <GeltonZ> @andre11dr It's not, closer to Bloody Roar really.
[0:38:32] <@Menitta> Does this one have the black shirt sasuke
[0:38:33] <andre11dr> Or Tenkaichi
[0:38:35] <+philliam1994> Clash of Ninja series are rare games I lost both of my games D:

[0:40:02] <Super_Voltekka> ToD's are possible cuz no damage scaling LUL
[0:40:03] <CyrusVGZ> Nostalgia is kicking the shit out of my right now. This was my childhood.

[0:40:41] <dragonify_> You have to be grounded for it to work
[0:40:41] <CyrusVGZ> Matt_Damon_Old.gif
[0:40:48] <brutalmoon2> its because he is off the floor he cant y cancel
[0:40:53] <@Menitta> Oh hsitr
[0:40:53] <+Mendin> Lee's going into the air too, try BBA I think is a grounded lift kick
[0:40:55] <@Menitta> shit*
[0:40:55] <biomegabear> Cool
[0:41:02] <majinken> that blue light signals the cancel
[0:41:08] <FriskyBusiness1> @WoolieVersus y cancels only work if the opponent is airborne and youre grounded
[0:41:22] <CyberEne> this soundtrack slaps
[0:41:23] <LibriJamm> Grounded launchers only
[0:41:26] <+Deyne_547> is this the moded version where tournament players play on?
[0:41:32] <+BigBlackBankai> Rion Combination
[0:41:35] <+SpicyNipples_> I love Super gnt4 !!!!!!1!!!!!

[0:41:54] <+SpicyNipples_> Lee Try BBAAY for feint
[0:42:01] <CyberEne> why does this game have some 3rd strike ass music
[0:42:07] <+BigBlackBankai> CAW
[0:42:09] <+Deyne_547> the naruto fighterz
[0:42:12] <FriskyBusiness1> i think im gonna mess with lee to help find stuff
[0:42:15] <CyrusVGZ> I was a Sharingan Sasuke main back in the day.
[0:42:15] <+SpicyNipples_> i think you just needed to restart match @WoolieVersus
[0:42:19] <brutalmoon2> The people who made the music for this game also made the music for Street Fighter EX
[0:42:20] <odiemikes> ino's got a great design is her character not dogshit in the manga?
[0:42:21] <+Deyne_547> like hyper dbz
[0:42:27] <biomegabear> imagine if you could change ino with other characters as your system theme
[0:42:34] <%kingkaito1123> @deyne_547 It really is Naruto Fighterz lol
[0:43:06] <CyrusVGZ> I don't really play fighting games anymore but if ArcSys made a 2D Naruto fighting game I would buy it on release day.
[0:43:06] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[0:43:45] <OrpheusMinato> Yoo! Is this game fan translated?!
[0:43:45] <@Menitta> Oh yeah Shikamaru dodges
[0:43:47] <deafmelone> Gamabunta’s bath also has fire music
[0:43:53] <@Menitta> He doesnt block its sick
[0:43:54] <Solidnick18> shino
[0:43:54] <%agoaj> Shika's block is godlike
[0:43:59] <+BigBlackBankai> This looks like a Tony Hawk screen.
[0:44:03] <+squidlord482> @orpheusminato and fan balanced with new stages
[0:44:04] <Viktor616> Is Haku still busted in this
[0:44:08] <wahilliham> HES BACK IN
[0:44:11] <%Juriasu> whoa
[0:44:11] <dragonify_> Woke Hinata
[0:44:11] <stormhawk9891> Yo what about Sharingan Kakashi copying supers tho!?
[0:44:13] <brutalmoon2> @SpicyNipples_ I am best Kiba in the world and best player in Brazil, so I guess I finally have my first fan. Sure
[0:44:13] <nfsman34> @OrpheusMinato Yep, the mod is fan translated.
[0:44:15] <majinken> Shikimaru auto dodges
[0:44:16] <%ggbhtg> Hinata BEYONDO
[0:44:22] <EvCrom> this is sick
[0:44:24] <%gatorafan> VIOLENT Hinata
[0:44:25] <Dante_Namikaze1> it's from that one time Hinata was cool in that one filler episode
[0:44:30] <RaidenRising> hinata blanco
[0:44:30] <Solidnick18> oh wow
[0:44:30] <@Menitta> HE DODGES
[0:44:34] <biomegabear> violent hinata
[0:44:34] <@Menitta> YEYEYE
[0:44:35] <%kingkaito1123> Shin Hinata
[0:44:37] <+Mendin> Instead of blocking (grounded) attacks, Shika dodges which means much less guardbreak
[0:44:39] <GeltonZ> YO! Those are Bloody Roar Primal Fury dodges!
[0:44:46] <+Parrish_broadnax> Hes not about it
[0:44:47] <+Deyne_547> shikamaru was busted no chip damage
[0:44:49] <hassanico2> What's this Hinata supposed to be?
[0:44:49] <+SpicyNipples_> @brutalmoon2 Best Kiba in the World

[0:45:07] <OrpheusMinato> @OrpheusMinato Oh cool! Gotta look into this!
[0:45:14] <ELFucilaNeroIV> UI Goku should've had this
[0:45:15] <+Mendin> This is Hinata if she had Neji leveled Byakugan skills
[0:45:16] <brutalmoon2> I think I know you Nipples
[0:45:18] <CyberEne> @WoolieVersus does this get matches on slippi
[0:45:18] <BlackermanZX> UI goku does that
[0:45:20] <biomegabear> The anime game puts the work in when other games dont
[0:45:21] <@Solidus_113> that goes against some visual clarity
[0:45:23] <Viktor616> This really is the proto FighterZ
[0:45:27] <CyrusVGZ> Shikamaru dodging because he's too lazy to block.
[0:45:34] <+SpicyNipples_> You didnt even get to open gates on Lee
[0:45:38] <+squidlord482> @orpheusminato you can download it pre patches from the discord server just Google Super GNT4
[0:45:41] <p_switch> Has Woolie talked about Temari and her zero to death?
[0:45:41] <FriskyBusiness1> i found a y cancel string for lee
[0:45:45] <+Battletankbob> doesn't shika have a down x
[0:45:50] <%CaptainPileDriver> is akamaru a selectable character in this game like he was in the second game
[0:45:51] <mikewwm98> Shikamaru is Ninja Orange Cassidy. Change my mind
[0:45:51] <RaidenRising> shikamaru ui
[0:45:53] <+Mendin> Most characters have two supers, a normal X and a down.X
[0:45:53] <%nintega010> WutFace ResidentSleeper Hinata
[0:45:57] <+Mendin> People with installs have a b.X
[0:46:11] <+TopTieramisu> Naruto carries the fgc
[0:46:30] <+StrawberryPantsu> Woolie and Reggie bout ta kiss
[0:46:32] <CyrusVGZ> Karin > *
[0:46:32] <+Battletankbob> shika gets bored with the fight
[0:46:32] <OrpheusMinato> @squidlord482 Thanks for the info! Definitely trying this out
[0:46:38] <andre11dr> Also while we talking about blocking animations, i always liked Thouther in the Hokuto no Ken just blocks with his chest
[0:46:48] <CyberEne> any online in this game
[0:46:53] <+SpicyNipples_> yes^
[0:46:57] <+Deyne_547> didn't in the later games shikamaru blocking caused no chip?

[0:47:41] <+Mendin> Oh they made all of Lees and Gais attacks do chip? I think in base GNT4 they had to open a gate to get that
[0:47:45] <+philliam1994> can someone link the Naruto discord?
[0:47:50] <LoopiDarko> oh shit this game actually has some stuff?
[0:47:56] <CyrusVGZ> Both Naruto series have competitive scenes and it's beautiful.
[0:47:58] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @brutalmoon2
[0:48:00] <+Battletankbob> @deyne_547 i wanna say the first game he was in he didn't take chip damage? but been a while

[0:49:43] <%mousesorcerer> dellyHi

[0:51:10] <+Deyne_547> he lacks in aerial neutral
[0:51:25] <andre11dr> Also i must say, crossup superdash ,that's dumb
[0:51:28] <%ggbhtg> Wake Up Kick
[0:51:37] <%ggbhtg> there used to be NO wake up attack
[0:51:44] <@Menitta> So its also delayed wake up

[0:52:52] <%krispen_wa> MY BURNING BRAIN
[0:52:54] <SableS139a> So I dropped into something fun-looking. How much have I missed gents?
[0:52:55] <+Jaysky> One friend of mine ported this game
[0:52:56] <hadoking2> "Oh I forgot, my friend told me the secrets of the universe"
[0:53:03] <andre11dr> Parsec FighterZ is pretty fire tho
[0:53:03] <treblesom> devil viewers
[0:53:05] <odiemikes> my frend john gekito taisen

[0:53:32] <%mousesorcerer> stress195TeaMonkey
[0:53:33] <@Menitta> Man I never realized how much tech this game had. I just played it a ton with my buddy in elementary school
[0:53:41] <%ggbhtg> I heard Itachi was SSS tier
[0:53:46] <hassanico2> Someone refresh me on what Okizeme means again?
[0:54:00] <%ChoculaUltra> Itachi's counter super still gives me ptsd FeelsBadMan
[0:54:01] <RaidenRising> insert madara copy pasta
[0:54:08] <andre11dr> Why did we never got a One Piece game like this?
[0:54:12] <+Mendin> In base GNT4 Itachi had an un-escapable infinite off a 360 degree counter super
[0:54:20] <+Mendin> They rebalanced that in sGNT4
[0:54:27] <KohryuFR> @andre11dr Isn't there one on GameCube? I think?
[0:54:29] <odiemikes> @andre11dr luffy in jump force all u get
[0:54:29] <%ChoculaUltra> you ever notice One Piece only gets weird ass beat'em ups and musou games?
[0:54:35] <+squidlord482> @hassanico2 if I understand correctly it’s just pressure
[0:54:38] <+Jaysky> I was stuck with Clash of Ninja 1-2, then waited forever for this to release stateside and it never did.
[0:54:38] <+TopTieramisu> itachi being op? just as kishimoto intended
[0:54:47] <+Battletankbob> thats why itachi was banned in tournaments back in the day, huh?
[0:54:54] <SableS139a> Overpowered Itachi sounds about right, tbh
[0:54:55] <%ChoculaUltra> I hope they throw DON for gamecube on the list
[0:54:56] <+SpicyNipples_> Itachi feels like a rpg boss in this game
[0:54:56] <%ggbhtg> More like Sub into Sub into Sub into Sub into Sub into Sub....
[0:54:56] <%agoaj> Did they balance the dog though???
[0:54:57] <+Mendin> Itachi was high to top tier in GNT2-3-4 yeah
[0:55:03] <hadoking2> Was he banned?
[0:55:05] <Dave_VD> @hassanico2 When one player is one the ground and the other is standing
[0:55:05] <GeltonZ> @andre11dr There are good One Piece fighters but they're stuck in Japan and super obscure. Grand Adventure isn't bad, but there's a 3DS One Piece game from ArcSys that can be played against their DBZ 3DS game.
[0:55:08] <@Menitta> THIS IS THE STANCE
[0:55:12] <+squidlord482> Also yeah we need a good One Piece fighting game. Like the closest we have is Burning Blood, that PS4 arena fighter
[0:55:19] <hassanico2> @squidlord482 @Dave_VD thanks!
[0:55:21] <+Mendin> This is the high level tech stuff
[0:55:22] <+Reaverund> In DBZ Budokai, the entire meta was just having more ki meter than your oppenent so you could teleport behind them more times than they could teleport behind you.
[0:55:26] <+TopTieramisu> good luck with hitboxes in a one piece fighter LUL
[0:55:26] <%mousesorcerer> pikatsPeek
[0:55:31] <brutalmoon2> @WoolieVersus you can cancel scaling
[0:55:43] <GeltonZ> @squidlord482 There are TONS of One Piece fighters and Burning Blood is the WORST. Grand Adventure is better.
[0:55:47] <Viktor616> Does Super GNT4 work on real hardware?
[0:55:51] <ikantreeed> what is that bird noise???
[0:55:59] <+Battletankbob> a bird
[0:56:07] <brutalmoon2> @WoolieVersus you do it by walking while doing y cancel combos instead of being standing still
[0:56:09] <+TopTieramisu> blue bird
[0:56:14] <+Jaysky> I used to main Gaara, Rock Lee as the sub
[0:56:19] <%agoaj> Aoi
[0:56:27] <%ggbhtg> Seems that there were a buuuuunch of zero to deaths
[0:56:28] <+Battletankbob> zabz was my fav

[0:58:32] <+Jaysky> Oh fuck I just realized I can totally emulate this now
[0:58:37] <%ChoculaUltra> show shikamaru's block animation!
[0:58:40] <MichelangeloStark> stop! STOP! Stop using best girl as a punching bag!
[0:58:41] <SableS139a> It's weird seeing Hinata with short hair again after seeing her with long hair for the longest time.
[0:58:55] <@Menitta> I love how Naruto Abridged, thats just Shikamaru asleep
[0:58:58] <Leonheart777> @sables139a And boobs
[0:59:01] <+Mendin> @WoolieVersus b.A is each character's counter attack, for the most part, too.
[0:59:03] <%krispen_wa> its weird seeing hinata without massive yabbos
[0:59:05] <SableS139a> Also why is best grill being used as a punching bag? At least use Sakura.
[0:59:05] <andre11dr> Man i should probably read the rest of HxH ,i only watched the anime
[0:59:07] <+BigBlackBankai> Reggie spoke with God
[0:59:10] <KohryuFR> "He told me!"
[0:59:12] <Arek_1> How do you block? Hold back or block button?
[0:59:14] <%ggbhtg> I don't know nothing bout no 8ing, lemme see some stuff
[0:59:16] <ELFucilaNeroIV> I'm being reminded to that time when Shikamaru voiced X
[0:59:18] <SableS139a> @Leonheart777 Also true.
[0:59:20] <+Mendin> Hold back
[0:59:24] <hadoking2> @Arek_1 Hold back or do nothing

[0:59:31] <+Battletankbob> think can hold nothing to block too?
[0:59:37] <%agoaj> When's the dog coming out?
[0:59:42] <nfsman34> There's 39, but Akamaur solo is banned, so it's 38 characters.
[0:59:43] <%CaptainPileDriver> it was team 7 and zabuza and haku
[0:59:44] <+SpicyNipples_> Lee go 8 gates
[0:59:45] <+Jaysky> Mighto Guy

[1:01:06] <KohryuFR> I think that the Narutimate series got more popular because it was on PS2 as well, GNT was on the less popular Gamecube
[1:01:09] <%ggbhtg> This is some STRIVE damagae
[1:01:15] <zyaksha> Omg GNT4 I love this game!

[1:03:05] <+Mendin> You can adjust the damage setting
[1:03:06] <nfsman34> Just so you know @WoolieVersus, for characters that have form changes, Back X activates the mode change. For Lee that's the 8 Gates.

[1:04:56] <SableS139a> @MichelangeloStark One of the only reasons I even touched Shippuden was to see Hinata score her happy ending. Loved the cinnamon roll since I started with Naruto Classic as a kid.
[1:04:57] <+Mendin> Reggie: If you cant turn around fast enough, just dash forward to get away from the teleport
[1:05:01] <+Deyne_547> @Boner_Girl yes

[1:06:36] <+SpicyNipples_> wait i didnt know it could do that lmao
[1:06:36] <@Menitta> Oh wow
[1:06:37] <lovesosa236> man revolution 2 had a much better character select screen
[1:06:47] <+Mendin> Attack Power 1 also gives you a longer game if you want that
[1:06:49] <%ggbhtg> "Fuck you, it's January!"
[1:06:50] <MichelangeloStark> @sables139a she was a sweet wallflower who had burden on her shoulders, admired Naruto for his strength, and worked hard to recognize her own. she deserves her happy ending. Unlike Some Other Characters..
[1:06:52] <%ChoculaUltra> the Rev games were the Wii ones, right?
[1:06:59] <@Menitta> yes
[1:07:00] <%ggbhtg> yes choc
[1:07:03] <Solidnick18> yeeeeee
[1:07:05] <agadejobi> Ramen Ichiraku night!
[1:07:05] <andre11dr> Satan survived being smacked by Cell, i don't think Lee would survive that
[1:07:06] <SableS139a> @MichelangeloStark F A C T S
[1:07:14] <%ChoculaUltra> I had a modded Gamecube but never shelled out for a modded Wii at the time so I completely missed them FeelsBadMan
[1:07:17] <DSD24> BLOODY ROAR?
[1:07:17] <KohryuFR> RIP Unsho Ishizuka btw
[1:07:18] <Super_Voltekka> Steve Blum all up in this bitch
[1:07:20] <biomegabear> bloddy roar
[1:07:20] <HeroicVanguard> YES Zabuza is mad fun
[1:07:21] <FriskyBusiness1> FUNK AQUARIUM POG
[1:07:23] <SableS139a> SOURPLS
[1:07:24] <MichelangeloStark> @sables139a SeemsGood
[1:07:27] <SableS139a> GIVE ME THAT POISON
[1:07:28] <%Th3SmartAlec> SourPls
[1:07:28] <agadejobi> Wait, isn't this Bloody Roar?
[1:07:29] <DSD24> This is a Bloody Roar stage
[1:07:32] <Solidnick18> SourPls
[1:07:34] <agadejobi> This is a Bloody Roar stage
[1:07:34] <dmtjinni> WOOLZ HYPE
[1:07:34] <%ggbhtg> This stage is LITERALLY from Bruddy Roar
[1:07:36] <nfsman34> @DSD24 Yeah it's bloody roar.
[1:07:37] <FriskyBusiness1> PogChamp
[1:07:37] <%Klefth> This is from Bloody Roar LUL
[1:07:38] <puluxor> This stage is some Bloody Roar shit
[1:07:40] <%ChoculaUltra> and those damn action replay discs that let you by pass the region locks were always sold out LUL
[1:07:40] <majinken> Bloody Roar Extreme @woolieversus
[1:07:44] <scrumbotime> This is absolutely bloody roar but they slapped hokages on the glass
[1:07:44] <+Boner_Girl> The Konoha Shark Aquarium is canon
[1:07:47] <+LuckyRoooooo> I thought this looked familiar
[1:07:47] <wakeuplvl3> its a bug from playing on the cell games stage
[1:07:49] <brutalmoon2> @WoolieVersus I think you are on an old build. Every time you play on Cell Games the sfx goes mute
[1:07:50] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Bloody Roar :(
[1:07:51] <+Hollow_Mirage> Why does the water stage have the konoha symbol
[1:07:52] <DSD24> They just put a Konoha leaf there
[1:08:00] <+SpicyNipples_> sfx glitch weird, it had never happened to me
[1:08:04] <kasios> rip zabuza's va
[1:08:04] <MichelangeloStark> Steve blum voices half the characters. from Zabuza to Orochimaru, from Naruto to green naruto
[1:08:04] <HeroicVanguard> Don't miss the custom Naruto stained glass windows :D
[1:08:08] <%gatorafan> It's the leaf village aquarium, see? The emblem is at the top Kappa
[1:08:10] <+Jaysky> I remember punching fools into the pit with the red fish lighting
[1:08:12] <zyaksha> yeah i imagine hes on an older build
[1:08:15] <%Th3SmartAlec> MONSOON
[1:08:21] <+SpicyNipples_> ah older build makes sense
[1:08:22] <Arek_1> And Poison's USFIV theme is playing. LUL
[1:08:23] <HeroicVanguard> SFX Glitch is from the older build, caused after playing on Cell Games
[1:08:24] <+MrAtheGreat> hey this stage is from bloody roar primal fury
[1:08:30] <SuddenDeath> this looks like vf4 pai atage look it up
[1:08:31] <nfsman34> Also, the audio bug is fixed on the latest version. It happens when you play on cell games, all the sound FX gets messed up.
[1:08:53] <+Hollow_Mirage> So you’re saying this stage is from Ever17 Kappa
[1:09:02] <%ChoculaUltra> more people shoulda rocked the headband as an armband, just sayin'
[1:09:09] <+SpicyNipples_> true^
[1:09:11] <+BigBlackBankai> Always pick sword
[1:09:24] <MichelangeloStark> @choculaultra get that armband look back.
[1:09:31] <+Mendin> @WoolieVersus Most characters' d.X is a non-cinematic super
[1:09:35] <dragonify_> Yeah
[1:09:35] <FriskyBusiness1> @woolieversus supers are unblockable
[1:09:37] <+Gangjute8> finally a good fighting game
[1:09:38] <+notsosober9> do they know that they can press directionals mid combo?
[1:09:39] <hadoking2> Hella unblockable
[1:09:40] <DSD24> I noticed Woolie and Reggie's new camera set up
[1:09:43] <SableS139a> @ChoculaUltra Probably would be more comfortable. Also not in the way as much.
[1:09:47] <+notsosober9> Because you can press high or low strings!!
[1:09:49] <%ggbhtg> Y'all didn't look at that part of the guide LUL
[1:09:51] <Dante_Namikaze1> They always were
[1:09:55] <+paladinstarbuster> gross
[1:09:58] <+humdrumgum> so does zabuza ever come back into the story or was he just a one and done character?
[1:09:59] <%mousesorcerer> woolieSPICE woolieKICKDAD
[1:09:59] <zyaksha> kisame better than zabuza
[1:10:02] <townzzzzz> so do supers beat supers
[1:10:02] <brutalmoon2> @WoolieVersus I think you are on an old build. Every time you play on Cell Games the sfx goes mute
[1:10:07] <Triforceriku> @humdrumgum ninja war
[1:10:09] <+Boner_Girl> Zabuza comes back at the end
[1:10:10] <Dante_Namikaze1> @humdrumgum he does
[1:10:12] <+yargne> cow print zabuza
[1:10:17] <+humdrumgum> cool
[1:10:21] <DSD24> Didn't Zabuza die? or am I misremembering
[1:10:23] <%MyZombieDoodle> woolieGLORY woolieGLORY woolieGLORY
[1:10:25] <ELFucilaNeroIV> dat Acid synth
[1:10:27] <%ChoculaUltra> he did! twice!
[1:10:31] <Dante_Namikaze1> @dsd24 yep
[1:10:31] <Triforceriku> @DSD24 yeah, he and haku die
[1:10:32] <%mousesorcerer> Oh man Zabuza takes me back to being a lil babbu otaku
[1:10:35] <robotman37> Yes
[1:10:38] <+Gangjute8> @humdrumgum there's an arc late on where all the old one-off characters get another moment
[1:10:42] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> i started playing For Honor again and I can't believe the revenge mechanic was never really toned down
[1:10:43] <+Boner_Girl> During the ninja war they bring the dead characters back as immortal zombies
[1:10:44] <DSD24> Wow and he came back
[1:10:50] <+Mendin> That jumping sword pogo is a good y-cancel move
[1:10:56] <%gatorafan> We are losing sound channels every match PogChamp
[1:10:59] <%GiantRatThatMakesTheRulz> GiantRatThatMakesTheRulz subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! Been playing ass loads of Bayonetta 2. Forgot how much I loved it. Now I'm more excited for 3, whenever the hell that will be!
[1:10:59] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> or outright removed for that matter
[1:11:03] <%MyZombieDoodle> but they come back as sentient zombies
[1:11:06] <%Th3SmartAlec> No one's ever really gone LUL
[1:11:10] <DSD24> This is the stance!
[1:11:10] <Arek_1> @NotSoAccurateNo1 How's Warlord?
[1:11:25] <%Th3SmartAlec> DAMN
[1:11:26] <zyaksha> this is so awkward with no sfx lmao
[1:11:26] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:11:30] <DSD24> Didn't they add Jojo Poses in For Honor?
[1:11:31] <%ggbhtg> THE GREED
[1:11:31] <+paladinstarbuster> niceu
[1:11:35] <%CaptainPileDriver> does neil have both 64 and 128 palm supers in this?
[1:11:37] <%agoaj> Clash that ninja!
[1:11:38] <%mousesorcerer> woolieOMG
[1:11:43] <%CaptainPileDriver> *neji
[1:11:45] <%gatorafan> True ninja combat is stealthy Kappa
[1:11:48] <+Mendin> Just 64 but he also has Daikaiten
[1:11:49] <MichelangeloStark> I cosplayed various Naruto characters. I can confirm that having a headband on for lengths of time is tiring since it has to feel tight to not fall. so a tight headband, little food, constant con walking, and feeling the blood circulation above your ears
[1:11:49] <%ChoculaUltra> nah he's Neil now LUL
[1:11:51] <PhDream> He only had 64 palms @CaptainPileDriver
[1:11:51] <+squidlord482> @captainpiledriver 512
[1:11:52] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> @NotSoAccurateNo1 I just stayed on Warden. The 10 hours or so i have played, haven't seen any warlords
[1:11:57] <+BigBlackBankai> Did Japanese Zabuza always have the old Joseph voice?
[1:12:03] <%CaptainPileDriver> damn, wish he had the 128
[1:12:03] <PhDream> But he has Rotation as well @CaptainPileDriver
[1:12:19] <+Jaysky> One of my biggest issues with bringing everyone back as zombies was them bringing back Hidan like he was dead. Mother fucker loss was all about how he COULDN'T die.
[1:12:22] <%ChoculaUltra> doesn't he do the 128 if you're fighting the spider guy?
[1:12:24] <jellymang> neutral jump that super, REGGIEEEEEE @WoolieVersus
[1:12:29] <%CaptainPileDriver> I guess rotation is good but 128 was always super cool
[1:12:31] <@Menitta> Man I am marking out super hard. This is so much nostalgia for me
[1:12:40] <+askalta> 69
[1:12:45] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Jaysky Wait they brought him back to? Well that sucks
[1:12:53] <lotusdagoat> this game still looks pretry good
[1:13:04] <+Boner_Girl> killing 12 year olds is so satisfying
[1:13:05] <puluxor> I remember the jumping being too good
[1:13:07] <%MyZombieDoodle> Does this count as Woolie picking a boss character?
[1:13:08] <+Jaysky> Sure did, and he looked like a zombie. Bitch never died.
[1:13:09] <brutalmoon2> @WoolieVersus reset the game or downoad the new build
[1:13:12] <%mousesorcerer> LUL
[1:13:13] <brutalmoon2> cell games disables sfx
[1:13:16] <%ChoculaUltra> cel shaded games will always age gracefully
[1:13:22] <PhDream> Reset the whole game to fix the sfx @WoolieVersus
[1:13:24] <Arek_1> @MichelangeloStark Some characters like Pain used elastic bands for their forehead protectors, so you could get by with that.
[1:13:26] <+LuckyRoooooo> @Boner_Girl doodStare
[1:13:28] <jellymang> waifu Kreygasm
[1:13:29] <PhDream> Cell games kills the sfx on this build.
[1:13:29] <DSD24> Eyy Tsunade
[1:13:34] <MichelangeloStark> what up, tsunade!
[1:13:36] <@Menitta> Tsunade sick
[1:13:45] <zyaksha> @WoolieVersus make sure not to play cell games since your on an older build
[1:13:46] <jellymang> tsuna-BAE
[1:13:49] <jellymang> Kreygasm <3
[1:13:51] <%CaptainPileDriver> someone pick Crow the puppet
[1:13:55] <+BigBlackBankai> Remember when Shino never did anything again?
[1:13:56] <CyrusVGZ> We bringin' back Naruto headbands? I'll do it if y'all do it.
[1:13:58] <+SpicyNipples_> yeah its fixed now on latest build
[1:13:58] <PhDream> You're on an older build. No problem!
[1:14:02] <%MyZombieDoodle> Giga Milf woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE
[1:14:02] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> at least they aged better than jpg-on-face games
[1:14:03] <%ChoculaUltra> fucking Shino LUL
[1:14:06] <DSD24> Ok that means Bloody Roar stage is all good!
[1:14:24] <PhDream> It's been fixed on the latest build tho!
[1:14:25] <%Th3SmartAlec> @BigBlackBankai I do. Remember when Boruto ruined our boy Gaara's hair?
[1:14:30] <%agoaj> Do three man cell, get some more characters in there
[1:14:35] <ELFucilaNeroIV> of course
[1:14:38] <%ChoculaUltra> omg Gaara's haircut in Boruto is a war crime
[1:14:39] <zyaksha> Good choice i respect the itachi choice
[1:14:39] <@Solidus_113> Said everyone ever
[1:14:42] <agadejobi> Ramen Ichiraku night!'
[1:14:42] <%CaptainPileDriver> puppet vs dog
[1:14:49] <townzzzzz> black fire
[1:14:51] <%ggbhtg> Itachi was fuck busted, from the tourneys I saw
[1:14:58] <Solidnick18> he has the one hand out
[1:14:59] <DSD24> Itachi wanted to test the limit of his ability
[1:15:00] <%Th3SmartAlec> ...Itachi never DID have a reason for that one-armed look did he?
[1:15:02] <Solidnick18> yoooo
[1:15:03] <%MyZombieDoodle> does he do the crow thing?
[1:15:04] <zyaksha> Woolie picking the right character
[1:15:05] <@Menitta> Itachi did nothing wrong
[1:15:06] <%MyZombieDoodle> DAMN
[1:15:10] <majinken> @ggbhtg always has been
[1:15:12] <%kyh9> I prefer these movesets. More emphasis on the basics
[1:15:12] <%ChoculaUltra> He just liked resting his arm in a cool way
[1:15:17] <+paladinstarbuster> NO BIRDs PogChamp
[1:15:21] <MichelangeloStark> @arek_1 this was back in the day and I got a legit official headband from Japan (not that hot topic or bootleg shit) and I'm a stickler for accuracy so it had to be a tightened headband
[1:15:28] <Dante_Namikaze1> So it's everything but Susan and he doesn't take damage for using those because that wyas introduced yet
[1:15:29] <%ChoculaUltra> man, this is when anime fighters had standards.
[1:15:30] <elpollobosso> i want tsunade to pummel me
[1:15:31] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> @Th3SmartAlec Just like Auron in FF10
[1:15:33] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Menitta No. He missed one.
[1:15:34] <%agoaj> Let's see some crossify action
[1:15:36] <%xkczd> yo im an itachi main
[1:15:37] <%Klefth> Itachi without a gundam? WHat is this?
[1:15:42] <+Mendin> Try mixing up combos with A in the middle (ie: BBBAA or BBAB)
[1:15:43] <%ChoculaUltra> nowadays you get shit like Jump Force and the My Hero fighters FeelsBadMan
[1:15:47] <@Menitta> True LUL
[1:15:49] <%MyZombieDoodle> no ameratsu either...
[1:15:51] <%ggbhtg> died LUL
[1:15:53] <+Mendin> Welcome to Itachi's torpedo blind angles
[1:15:56] <dragonify_> Itachi jump A is unblockable if he's facing away from you lol
[1:15:58] <%LordSDB> Itachi remains a top tier always Kappa
[1:16:07] <%xkczd> xkczd subscribed with Prime.
[1:16:18] <DSD24> @ChoculaUltra Arena Fighters really look all the same unfortunately
[1:16:23] <CyrusVGZ> Jump Force is fine. My issue with the game though is that it's another pseudo MMO like Xenoverse instead of a single player game with multiplayer modes.
[1:16:29] <Memitim> oh wow super cool that woolie is doing this, But isn't it such a shame that Haku ISN'T IN THIS GAME AT ALL?
[1:16:39] <%MyZombieDoodle> use the super that puts your opponent into an infinite time loop based on sounds
[1:16:39] <PhDream> Haku is @Memitim
[1:16:39] <+Mendin> Are you being sarcastic?
[1:16:40] <DSD24> Wait Haku isn't in this?
[1:16:45] <%ggbhtg> He just teleport real good, just like in NUN3
[1:16:45] <PhDream> Haku is in the game lol
[1:16:49] <MichelangeloStark> wait, Haku is in
[1:16:49] <lovesosa236> why can't this get the tekken treatment Lars had a crossover lol
[1:16:50] <+Mendin> Haku is in this and (in oGNT4) is pretty solid
[1:16:50] <+LuckyRoooooo> hold on is haku top tier in this game?
[1:16:52] <%ChoculaUltra> I just really want to know who decided to go for the photo-realistic graphic look of Jump Force. I just want to talk I swear.
[1:16:55] <DSD24> Ok good I mean you got Zabuza
[1:16:56] <%ggbhtg> COUGH DROPS
[1:16:56] <nfsman34> @DSD24 Haku is, they're just not playing him
[1:16:59] <%ggbhtg> HALLS
[1:17:00] <%Th3SmartAlec> Remember when Kurenai's whole point in the story was to try to use Genjutsu on Itachi?
[1:17:06] <SableS139a> @DSD24 @ChoculaUltra Unless you're Virtual-On. Honestly one of the few exceptions to the rule since the series was made to be competitive from the get-go.
[1:17:14] <%Solid_Stro> Itachi remains to be the most OG character ever
[1:17:20] <zyaksha> Haku, Kankuro, Itachi top 3 imo
[1:17:25] <@Menitta> pick the ugly Sasuke form
[1:17:25] <Triforceriku> SourPls
[1:17:26] <elpollobosso> was this on gamecube?
[1:17:26] <%gatorafan> Reminder that Tobirama was right Kappa
[1:17:30] <SableS139a> SourPls
[1:17:30] <MichelangeloStark> @th3smartalec no,i don't remember a female character that isn't a plot device do anything in Naruto.
[1:17:31] <DSD24> @SableS139a Oh man I loved playing Virtual-On! I wish that series came back
[1:17:33] <+LuckyRoooooo> the memories dood lol
[1:17:38] <+BigBlackBankai> And get her cheeks clapped by Asuma.
[1:17:41] <Solidnick18> SourPls
[1:17:43] <%ChoculaUltra> the Storm series, as arena fighters, were actually really solid imo. So my standards for arena fighters rest solely on that series LUL
[1:17:44] <+Mendin> Jam on that wooden flute
[1:17:45] <+Jaysky> Wasn't cursed seal Sasuke busted?
[1:17:46] <CyrusVGZ> @ChoculaUltra I actually like the photo realistic look. It's interesting to see how well some art styles transfer over and how others don't.
[1:17:47] <%MyZombieDoodle> Grand Wizard Tobirama
[1:17:51] <RobinTheBard> oh god this is sick
[1:17:53] <MichelangeloStark> VIRTUAL ON needs to return. not that crossover with the rail gun Anime..
[1:17:54] <GeltonZ> @ChoculaUltra @DSD24 What's really sad is when people say they all look the same when they're DRASTICALLY different. The My Hero fghter is from the makers of Gundam VS and has a bunch of ex-Capcom folk in it...but recent patches have ruined the game. Meanwhile Jump Force is Spike Chunsoft.
[1:17:57] <majinken> @dsd24 it's on PS4
[1:17:58] <Memitim> Nope Haku isn't in this game and the senbon loops just don't exist
[1:17:59] <PhDream> In Vanilla GNT4 yes. @Jaysky
[1:18:17] <%CaptainPileDriver> always remember that racism would've ever many problems in naruto
[1:18:20] <elpollobosso> YO
[1:18:21] <%ChoculaUltra> can we let CyberConnect do the next Jump Force
[1:18:22] <zyaksha> @Jaysky One Tailed Kyuubi is the real busted
[1:18:23] <DSD24> @GeltonZ Yeah my bad for saying all arena fighters look the same
[1:18:25] <@Menitta> I still wanna get the MHA game just because I want a MHA game
[1:18:25] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1348891911097110529?s=19
[1:18:39] <GeltonZ> @DSD24 Not your fault, a lot of people say it.
[1:18:40] <biomegabear> @Menitta 2 game out
[1:18:43] <+Mendin> So close to a guardcrush
[1:18:44] <MichelangeloStark> @captainpiledriver that isn't exclusive to Naruto.
[1:18:47] <puluxor> Anybody remember the command for Tsunade's forehead flick?
[1:18:48] <SableS139a> @DSD24 The series still gets merch. Hell, there was the RailDex light novel and the sequel game that came after and a compilation of Operation Moon Gate, Oratorio Tangram, and FORCE. Sadly, everything VO related is stuck in Japan.
[1:18:53] <nailwind> the angle Kreygasm
[1:18:55] <%Th3SmartAlec> Kreygasm
[1:18:57] <+Jaysky> @zyaksha Id always see tournaments with those two fighting in finals
[1:19:01] <@Solidus_113> woolieGASM
[1:19:03] <zyaksha> @puluxor 6A
[1:19:03] <Solidnick18> Kreygasm mama tsunade
[1:19:04] <%Solid_Stro> Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[1:19:08] <@Menitta> go to horny jail
[1:19:15] <DSD24> Oh shit
[1:19:15] <@Menitta> YO
[1:19:15] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Stab
[1:19:16] <CyrusVGZ> CC2 is one of my favorite developers so I'd be fine with them making Jump Force 2.
[1:19:18] <MichelangeloStark> stabbed for 72 days...
[1:19:19] <Solidnick18> oh shit
[1:19:21] <townzzzzz> STAB
[1:19:21] <MichelangeloStark> hours
[1:19:22] <+SpicyNipples_> Takes your chakra too
[1:19:24] <@Solidus_113> 72 hours
[1:19:27] <zyaksha> @Jaysky yeah OTK was the best character in vanilla and cs2 is good in vanilla and super
[1:19:28] <MichelangeloStark> 72 hours..
[1:19:31] <+Boner_Girl> Super is... stab
[1:19:31] <+BigBlackBankai> Tfw when Tsunade will never kill you
[1:19:32] <SableS139a> @DSD24 @MichelangeloStark If we at least got the RailDex crossover game and the collection here overseas via Steam, I'd be fucking happy.
[1:19:40] <%Th3SmartAlec> Remember when no one ever did that again LUL
[1:19:44] <+LuckyRoooooo> @SpicyNipples_ your lying to me right?
[1:19:53] <majinken> @sables139a I've got masterpiece
[1:20:03] <GeltonZ> @SableS139a The RailDex game sucks.
[1:20:07] <+SpicyNipples_> @LuckyRoooooo nope, his super takes your meter
[1:20:08] <%agoaj> Who is OTK?
[1:20:23] <zyaksha> @agoaj One Tailed Kyuubi
[1:20:24] <HeroicVanguard> One Tailed Kyubey Naruto
[1:20:24] <+Mendin> @WoolieVersus Characters with b.A teleports can hold it to stay in the teleportation zone for longer (drains chakra to do)
[1:20:24] <PhDream> One Tailed Kyuubi Naruto
[1:20:27] <DSD24> Oh man that throw animation is straight up from Bloody Roar this game is by the same devs right?
[1:20:28] <SableS139a> @majinken The 15th Anniversary collection that came with Force, right?
[1:20:33] <+SpicyNipples_> One Tail Kyubi aka 1 tail naruto
[1:20:36] <metabot64> the drop is broken iirc it chains into itself for an infinite. one gnt match i saw just consisteted of itachi spaming that move
[1:20:36] <GeltonZ> @DSD24 Same devs, same engine
[1:20:37] <CyrusVGZ> @DSD24 yes
[1:20:38] <SableS139a> @GeltonZ Is it truly?
[1:20:40] <MutedMimic> LUL
[1:20:44] <DSD24> Sick
[1:20:49] <dragonify_> @agoaj One Tailed Naruto. From when he faught Sasuke
[1:20:56] <GeltonZ> @SableS139a Yes, no twin stick controls so it plays like a worse version of Gundam Vs.
[1:21:01] <MichelangeloStark> @sables139a you mean show support? if they can do it with UPPERS they can with railgun virtual On but we will have to wait years..
[1:21:08] <+paladinstarbuster> that drop is bullshit
[1:21:14] <nfsman34> @DSD24 Well, the mod uses animations from Bloody Roar to flesh out some movesets, most notably Anko.
[1:21:22] <puluxor> YEA YEA
[1:21:24] <CyrusVGZ> Maybe one day we'll be blessed with a new Bloody Roar game. Konami did just renew the IP for home console software so we'll see.
[1:21:24] <MutedMimic> Noice
[1:21:24] <SableS139a> @GeltonZ You don't even have Twin Stick controls as an option? I'm kinda surprised.
[1:21:25] <%ChoculaUltra> get heel smashed!
[1:21:25] <majinken> @sables139a no the one with OMG, OT, and 4ce
[1:21:25] <%Th3SmartAlec> OHHHHH PogChamp
[1:21:27] <MichelangeloStark> closest thing to a new virtual On is SADLY arms. prove me wrong. (aside from the dashing)

[1:21:46] <+Mendin> Guys don't forger that everyone had a d.X alternate super, some are non-cinematic and blockable
[1:21:47] <metabot64> later narutos made the drop cost meter

[1:21:57] <%ggbhtg> press attack if you didn't tech?
[1:21:58] <DSD24> Does Sakura have a Hidden Sakura super move
[1:22:00] <audibleellipsis> DID THAT SAY Z GAMES?
[1:22:01] <GeltonZ> @SableS139a Yup. Some people say they were patched in but I don't see them. People also get confused because there's a different twin stick control scheme but it's wrong. 3rd person shooter style.
[1:22:02] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Tsunade is hot and I'm not ashamed to say it.
[1:22:02] <hadoking2> @ChoculaUltra ye
[1:22:03] <metabot64> yes
[1:22:04] <nfsman34> @ChoculaUltra Yes
[1:22:05] <Solidnick18> yep
[1:22:05] <SableS139a> @majinken Gotcha. Still wish we got a Steam port. PC's pretty much my go-to for fighting games.
[1:22:05] <PhDream> Yes. Sword moves steal chakra
[1:22:06] <zyaksha> wake up kick is B on the ground
[1:22:06] <+BigBlackBankai> Remember when Anko hadn't become an Akimichi?

[1:22:41] <MichelangeloStark> @bigblackbankai dude, she's still cute
[1:22:43] <metabot64> actually i think with some glitches kisames block string is unblockable

[1:22:52] <%Th3SmartAlec> @CyrusVGZ No kappa needed my friend
[1:22:54] <%RaziWraith> teles are three bars OOF LUL
[1:22:59] <majinken> @sables139a I hear that Switch gets the bum rap the lobbies are a ghost town
[1:23:01] <SableS139a> @GeltonZ Shit, that's gotta be awkward. Speaking of Twin Sticks, I do want to try VO on an actual cabinet at some point to get that authentic feel.
[1:23:12] <GeltonZ> @CyrusVGZ I half agree. Thay's why I hate Naruto. The only attractive ladies are Haku and Kakashi's brother.
[1:23:15] <therealtacopancakes> @MichelangeloStark thanks lol, but I meant woolie and reggie, but cool to know you have different end screens
[1:23:22] <hassanico2> Wow Guy is WAAAAY less bombastic LUL
[1:23:29] <Mysidian_Maestro> Man that sample used in the MGS1 trailer.._
[1:23:34] <+Mendin> @hassanico2 Wait for his supers
[1:23:40] <hassanico2> Chat when these games came out, did these characters already all have VAs?
[1:23:42] <%ChoculaUltra> if Nintendo actually gave a semblance of a fuck for online play the Switch dock would've came with at least an ethernet port built in.
[1:23:48] <MichelangeloStark> @therealtacopancakes ah I see OWL2019Tracer
[1:23:53] <%RaziWraith> No jutsu ultimate? LUL
[1:23:53] <+MajorCrasher> @geltonz LUL
[1:23:53] <ELFucilaNeroIV> IIRC No matter which game, Samehada always steals meter.
[1:23:55] <%MyZombieDoodle> DAS PRETTY SICK
[1:24:01] <therealtacopancakes> KPOPlove
[1:24:05] <@Menitta> "You're such a great person"
[1:24:12] <SableS139a> @majinken Not too surprising. Switch kinda sucks for fighting games if you're a stickler for controls like I am. Logitech spoiled the ever-living shit out of me with their D-Pads.
[1:24:36] <%RaziWraith> the walk back avoid grab LUL
[1:24:39] <%Th3SmartAlec> So...was the Nine Tails in Naruto a dick because he was the Yin part, or did the hypnosis just last a long time?
[1:24:47] <%blaccbird914> blaccbird914 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 26 months! Over two years glad to be back.
[1:24:49] <+Mendin> Yes
[1:24:51] <andre11dr> Canon
[1:24:52] <PhiZeroOne> the switch pro d-pad is REAL good but trying to play anything on joy-cons is a mistake
[1:24:54] <townzzzzz> DIVE KICK
[1:24:57] <majinken> @sables139a the pro pad is a godsend
[1:24:59] <ozmon> I didn't know we were playing Dive Kick
[1:25:01] <andre11dr> Oh wait
[1:25:03] <CyrusVGZ> @ChoculaUltra To be fair, they probably didn't include an Ethernet port to keep the price low. Maybe there will be one on the Switch Pro.
[1:25:06] <%ggbhtg> ANGLE OF THE DANGLE pogChamp
[1:25:10] <DingusMcBaseball> are you guys playing with that fan patch or something? @WoolieVersus
[1:25:16] <PhDream> Yes
[1:25:16] <Solidnick18> come on guy sensei
[1:25:19] <+Mendin> Reggie's playing soulsgames, he must learn of the Dead Angles
[1:25:36] <%ChoculaUltra> @CyrusVGZ I can only hope. It's really ass the ethernet dongle takes up a usb slot too.
[1:25:38] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:25:39] <DSD24> This game looks rad
[1:25:40] <zyaksha> @DingusMcBaseball yeah there playing the modded version of GNT also known as Super GNT4
[1:25:41] <%Th3SmartAlec> @DingusMcBaseball Nah, they just wanted to revisit Naruto Kappa
[1:25:44] <SableS139a> @majinken May have to give it a shot at some point. I've got a bunch of SNK fighters on Switch that I don't want to struggle just to play decently.
[1:25:46] <%RaziWraith> Is this three round matches?
[1:25:52] <PhDream> Yes
[1:25:56] <PhDream> Bo5 matches

[1:26:47] <andre11dr> Not canon end
[1:26:48] <+Jaysky> Isn't there a special animation for him doing that to Rock Lee?
[1:26:52] <Dave_VD> This game is starting to look pretty cool after the last two matches
[1:26:54] <+Mendin> If Gai uses that hug super on Lee, Lee screams "GAI SENSEIIIIIIIIII"
[1:26:56] <hadoking2> @Memitim That's his down throw now

[1:27:33] <andre11dr> Did she had anything at this point?
[1:27:36] <majinken> ayy 3 way deadlock
[1:27:37] <Darren716> Boy he was lucky the 4th wasn't resurected
[1:27:38] <hassanico2> Sarutobi was THE COOLEST
[1:27:38] <BackwardCap> Sakura is a Stand user in this game.
[1:27:39] <elpollobosso> LOL
[1:27:39] <+paladinstarbuster> YO
[1:27:39] <%CaptainPileDriver> big forehead sakura hear to headbutt her way in

[1:27:49] <+SixMillionDollarGamer> Seems fair
[1:27:49] <hassanico2> ...is she gonna go Inner Sakura?
[1:27:49] <SableS139a> @majinken I need to grab Scott Pilgrim. I'd be disappointed in myself if I didn't.
[1:27:49] <+Mendin> Sarutobi is The Avatar, master of all elements
[1:27:50] <Darren716> Imagine if Minato saw how he was raising Nalt
[1:27:52] <Dave_VD> This stage is sick
[1:27:53] <Dante_Namikaze1> He did help raise him in off screen canon filler
[1:27:53] <jellymang> this bitch TOP tonyer
[1:27:56] <hassanico2> Cause she still had NOTHING at this point?
[1:27:57] <+jiggy_snipe> I mean Naruto had a house or something, he was fine
[1:27:58] <nailwind> man I hated the inner Sakura stuff
[1:27:59] <%AlteisenReiseZ> BEST STAGE
[1:28:01] <Super_Voltekka> Fun Fact: If you used Sealed Orochimaru's special where Kabuto summons Manda in this stage in Ultimate Ninja 2, Manda disappears from the background
[1:28:05] <DSD24> Inner Sakura!
[1:28:05] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Darren716 Even though the 1st and 2nd, later on in canon, would have absolutely SMOKED him
[1:28:10] <DSD24> Get hype for it
[1:28:13] <hassanico2> Like, she never did ANYTHING until Shippuden right? Not even a kunai throw or anything?
[1:28:18] <CyrusVGZ> Imma keep it 100. Time skip Sakura is significantly cooler than she was pre-time skip.
[1:28:20] <Jrocy247> Man you can just tell they had to make up a movelist for Sakura, because she just has NOTHING
[1:28:21] <andre11dr> They have to make up shit just to give her a moveset because she's useless nothing
[1:28:24] <%ChoculaUltra> did they ever explain why the 3rd never told Naruto about his parents ?
[1:28:30] <%ChoculaUltra> like at all?
[1:28:36] <SableS139a> @ChoculaUltra Screwing over the Uzumaki's is just a thing for everyone it seems...
[1:28:36] <brutalmoon2> What is this hate boner for sakura this is worse than the monkey hate on youtube
[1:28:38] <%Th3SmartAlec> @hassanico2 She tackled a guy and bit him instead of stabbing him. Oh, and she and Ino had a bitch fight
[1:28:38] <zyaksha> Sakura is actually very good in this game
[1:28:42] <nailwind> did she just do a shoryuken
[1:28:42] <DSD24> Nice slaps
[1:28:55] <%ChoculaUltra> @SableS139a being an Uzumaki is pain FeelsBadMan
[1:28:56] <SableS139a> S L A P P E D

[1:29:09] <brutalmoon2> she's cooler than you
[1:29:18] <zyaksha> @Jrocy247 she is good in this game atleast, very good
[1:29:19] <Jrocy247> LUL I doubt it

[1:30:35] <%Th3SmartAlec> @biomegabear who
[1:30:36] <Flamethrowerman09> How much cooler would Sakura and Ino be if they could do the things in the actual series that they could do in the games?
[1:30:38] <$Noponiz> is reggie failing the timing or why is he trying the same juggle that doesnt work 109 times?
[1:30:39] <+Jaysky> @klefth Nuh uh, she loooooved Sasuke! That's a character trait, right?

[1:31:05] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> BACK TO THE STREETS

[1:31:19] <%Th3SmartAlec> THAT GUY LUL
[1:31:19] <Arek_1> @ChoculaUltra No. But my headcannon is that that would be a bad idea. They named gave Naruto the Uzumaki last name so he wouldn't be followed by Minato's enemies. Tell Naruto about his parents? He's a loudmouth and would babble about it. LUL
[1:31:20] <biomegabear> Wait what?

[1:31:43] <+SixMillionDollarGamer> Does he have his Beast form tho?
[1:31:46] <%ChoculaUltra> @Arek_1 that actually makes a lot of sense if they were trying to hide the 9 tails and all that jazz
[1:31:50] <nailwind> maybe Sakura is just really into neglect Kappa dad's fault
[1:31:52] <hadoking2> But is he tho?
[1:31:57] <+hypemaster19> u bought into those theories woolie
[1:31:58] <hamahiroyuki> now that i think what was even the plan when kishi made sakura from the start?
[1:31:58] <hadoking2> Kappa
[1:31:59] <%Youknowwhyimhere008> woolieDATTEBAYO
[1:32:01] <%agoaj> Mizuki actually told Madara to do everything
[1:32:02] <elpollobosso> i could see it
[1:32:05] <%ChoculaUltra> but ffs, the kid grew up thinking his parents didn't give a fuck! That's dark!
[1:32:07] <ozmon> I had to google who Mizuki was
[1:32:07] <+Mendin> The size of that shank he tosses
[1:32:07] <+BigBlackBankai> Big Furry Mode
[1:32:08] <%kyh9> GET HIM MIZUKI
[1:32:18] <%Solid_Stro> It was Mizuki all along doodNuts
[1:32:26] <%Th3SmartAlec> How. HOW was he the first guy to ever drop the Nine Tails thing on Naruto? Heck,the behavior of the entire village in hindsight makes no sense.
[1:32:36] <+LokimenD> Is Zabuza in this game? Is he still the coolest?
[1:32:39] <andre11dr> I feel like I would look more fondly Naruto if Naruto and Sasuke both fucking died fighting each other, and everyone else was like "That's what you get for being such a stalker"
[1:32:39] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:32:42] <%ChoculaUltra> oh my god, Mizuki really was the first dude to tell him wasn't he LUL
[1:32:44] <+Mendin> @LokimenD Yes on both
[1:32:45] <SableS139a> @LokimenD Yes and Yes
[1:32:45] <Memitim> Can kakashi still steal ults in this game? thought that was the coolest shit back in the day.
[1:32:46] <biomegabear> mizuki seems like a spy for like orochimaru, I wouldnt be surprised
[1:32:47] <zyaksha> @LokimenD yes and ehhhhh lmao
[1:32:53] <CyrusVGZ> Zabuza sword can't be beat.
[1:33:05] <nailwind> ballerina spin on them
[1:33:14] <%ChoculaUltra> remember that filler arc where they brought Mizuki back as a furry tiger hybrid
[1:33:17] <Triforceriku> why was the lightning bolt attack not in more games, it's so slick
[1:33:24] <+hypemaster19> everyone remembers
[1:33:24] <nailwind> @ChoculaUltra why would you bring this curse upon us
[1:33:29] <%mousesorcerer> woolieOMG
[1:33:30] <%Solid_Stro> Oh that read woolieSHOOK
[1:33:37] <%ChoculaUltra> @nailwind I can't suffer alone dammit
[1:33:37] <DracOmega64> @ChoculaUltra What?
[1:33:42] <biomegabear> Is the only good filler in naruto "behind kakashi's mask"
[1:33:45] <Arek_1> How did people even find out that Naruto was the next jinchuriki?
[1:33:45] <nailwind> i wanted to sleep tonight...
[1:33:52] <+LokimenD> I gotta ask, what's with the facecam?
[1:33:59] <+BigBlackBankai> CURRY OF LIFE
[1:34:00] <+hypemaster19> sora one
[1:34:02] <+Mendin> Vs mode facecam
[1:34:03] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Arek_1 And wasn't that when they were getting ready for the Third's funeral? LUL
[1:34:06] <RedZeddy> the heads in the back are really small LUL
[1:34:08] <+Boner_Girl> Everyone knew. They just werent allowed to talk about it
[1:34:10] <%RaziWraith> Vs. mode facecam
[1:34:22] <+Mendin> You can charge that Raikiri to bait out evasion and boost damage
[1:34:26] <zyaksha> Woolie press 4x
[1:34:34] <+jjolion> I remember this I had this on the Wii
[1:34:36] <Flamethrowerman09> Look how huge these two are in comparison to the background.
[1:34:43] <nailwind> Naruto's life is one whole NDA contract Kappa
[1:34:46] <townzzzzz> the wiffs
[1:34:53] <PhDream> Then you had the Revolution games @jjolion
[1:34:53] <+Xenstroke> hold that button on that Raikiri
[1:34:55] <+SixMillionDollarGamer> I want to know how did everyone not know Naruto was the 4th's kid, were they dumb or blind?
[1:34:56] <Arek_1> @Boner_Girl But that whole sealing event was deep in a forest. While the village was dealing with the aftermath of the 9-tails attack...
[1:34:58] <SableS139a> @nailwind Pretty much
[1:35:01] <FriskyBusiness1> do you guys know that if you hit R to sub you get a sub and an attack?
[1:35:02] <%ChoculaUltra> those house thingies on the mountain range seem awfully small in comparison
[1:35:11] <MutedMimic> DuckerZ
[1:35:15] <DSD24> Its the last round!
[1:35:16] <Jrocy247> Can you tell this game was made in the 2000s
[1:35:27] <puluxor> I love these running attacks
[1:35:28] <+BigBlackBankai> CAW
[1:35:39] <CyrusVGZ> I felt like a goddamn genius as a kid when I told everyone that Tobi was Obito, no one believed me then it actually happened. Goddamn Genius.
[1:35:41] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Boner_Girl How much did they know? Because let's think about the fact they were all okay with ostracsizing the son of the couple that died to save the village, AND that pissing him could lead to the Fox blowing up the village again.
[1:35:58] <+Mendin> That slow walk back from a BB into a dash-throw punish, classic
[1:36:17] <DSD24> Yooo
[1:36:18] <+hypemaster19> LUL

[1:36:36] <%ChoculaUltra> fun fact, Eighting, the company that developed the GNT series also co-developed MvC3 with Capcom.

[1:37:02] <+SixMillionDollarGamer> Can't use those arms anymore now, Reggie

[1:37:14] <CyrusVGZ> Now do 3-on-3 Kappa
[1:37:18] <%ChoculaUltra> Neji was right the whole time FeelsBadMan
[1:37:19] <Solidnick18> he's alive aye
[1:37:21] <agadejobi> Ramen Ichiraku night!
[1:37:23] <Jrocy247> Shut up Woolie
[1:37:25] <%kyh9> shut up woolie
[1:37:25] <audibleellipsis> oh my god you can play as akamaru in this game? That rules!
[1:37:28] <puluxor> Neji let's GO
[1:37:30] <nailwind> arms gone - full time feet user now
[1:37:31] <%ggbhtg> Because America never got past Taisen 2
[1:37:40] <DSD24> @Th3SmartAlec Genius Man Neji
[1:37:44] <Thunderhog> SourPls
[1:37:46] <+Mendin> @audibleellipsis He has low life but his hitbox is Oddjob-tiny, he is banned in tournament play accordingly
[1:37:48] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Oh god Gaara's face
[1:37:53] <Dante_Namikaze1> so you were the crying Wojack for Naruto games back in the day Woolie
[1:37:54] <+Mendin> But still funny
[1:37:58] <%Th3SmartAlec> THE SWIIIIIIING PogChamp
[1:38:00] <%ChoculaUltra> that was Gaara's no talk me angy face
[1:38:05] <andre11dr> I know as much as people like to shit on the great ninja war,i will say Yellow coat Naruto is pretty awesome design
[1:38:09] <nailwind> Gaara actually throwing a punc
[1:38:25] <+Mendin> That triple jab also drains a little of the opponent's meter, btw
[1:38:28] <%RaziWraith> Oh I wonder what the name of that super is Kappa
[1:38:29] <%mousesorcerer> Gaara <3 <3 <3
[1:38:36] <ozmon> Neji always sick
[1:38:46] <Jrocy247> Man, Neji and Orochimaru are broken because of the chakra steal shit
[1:38:47] <DSD24> Realm of my Divinity?
[1:39:00] <+Jaysky> So out of the konoha 12 is safe to say Ino is the worst as a solo ninja, right?
[1:39:05] <CyrusVGZ> I wanted a Sharingan vs. Byakugan fight so badly when I was in high school but they never gave it to me.
[1:39:09] <deafmelone> Bloody Roar Shit?!
[1:39:09] <%Th3SmartAlec> You know what would probably be better if you could hit your opponent rather than blocking their chakra? ...Stabbing them.
[1:39:16] <+Mendin> the Hyuugas have their own special kind of move cancels, too
[1:39:17] <Dante_Namikaze1> @jaysky Sakura
[1:39:27] <Triforceriku> @CyrusVGZ they STILL ain't gave it to us
[1:39:30] <%Solid_Stro> And then Naruto would go on to call Neji’s killer “The Coolest Guy” Kappa
[1:39:34] <nailwind> @CyrusVGZ all that hype and build up for nothing
[1:39:36] <+Mendin> You can suddenly drop out of a combo mid-blockstring and throw someone and they'll get v confused
[1:39:45] <%ChoculaUltra> I always thought Neji circa the Save Sasuke arc would've demolished Sasuke in a fight
[1:39:46] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:39:47] <andre11dr> @jaysky I feel like Ino does more than Ten Ten
[1:40:00] <+Xenstroke> hey is this the version that has Lee's busted gates in it?
[1:40:06] <+Jaysky> Sakura eventually gets competent and can heal, Ino becomes completely vulnerable if she so much as misses her one ability
[1:40:11] <DSD24> Ino punched Sakura that one time
[1:40:11] <%RaziWraith> everyone does more than TenTen LUL
[1:40:11] <Triforceriku> we literallty had another chance with Boruto and Sarada, but then they just didn't give Bort the byakugan
[1:40:13] <%CaptainPileDriver> until we go online, someone's hosting a def jam session on parsec
[1:40:15] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Dante_Namikaze1 No, still Ino. Her technique only works with backup. Also, doesn't work on tough people because she should be able to fight anyone otherwise.
[1:40:15] <zyaksha> @Xenstroke it has lee gate but idk about busted
[1:40:15] <hamahiroyuki> I heard somewhere that hinata wasnt in nart's team because that would cliche. does that mean he made sakura just to fill the team? now i think back it feels like kishi didnt have any idea what he was doing with her character
[1:40:22] <+pleadv> Yo is this clash of ninja?
[1:40:25] <SableS139a> Was the Byakugan ever use for anything in-universe besides close combat? Considering how busted it seemed, ranged combatants and medics could do a metric fuckton with it.
[1:40:25] <+Mendin> Ino works more as a backline telepathy/sensor support later on I think
[1:40:29] <DingusMcBaseball> thats definitely based on Longs punches from bloody roar
[1:40:29] <PhDream> Yes @pleadv
[1:40:38] <+Jaysky> It's why I said as a solo ninja
[1:40:51] <zyaksha> @pleadv yeah specifically the modded Version named Super Clash of ninja
[1:41:02] <deafmelone> Neji doing Long’s shit from bloody roar is siiiiick
[1:41:03] <%ChoculaUltra> still bummed out Sakura had that amazing fight against Sasori but literally did nothing for the rest of Shippudden till the war arc team 10 fan service shit.
[1:41:08] <+pleadv> Is it rebalanced or something?
[1:41:10] <+Jaysky> As a solo her one redeeming trait is near useless unless in a 1v1 situation
[1:41:18] <PhDream> Yes @pleadv
[1:41:22] <zyaksha> @pleadv yes incredibly
[1:41:26] <Super_Voltekka> NEJI WAS RIGHT
[1:41:26] <PhDream> Rebalanced heavily
[1:41:29] <%Th3SmartAlec> Oh yes, remember when Orochimaru was introduced as terrifying? LUL
[1:41:30] <SableS139a> @hamahiroyuki That... would actually make a lot of sense. Shove best grill onto another team (which wasn't a bad one thankfully), but come up with someone else with no real gameplan behind them.
[1:41:32] <+pleadv> Its seems like it be a fun game to play with friends for a night
[1:41:37] <zyaksha> it has many bug fixes and rebalancing among other things
[1:41:40] <Wakimaki2285> these menu noises are hella nostalgic
[1:41:45] <+SixMillionDollarGamer> To do actual ninja things, Ino is probably pretty skilled. But since when is doing stealthy ninja things matter in Naruto?
[1:41:49] <nailwind> @SableS139a that'd be so sick, but Hyuugas don't seem too bright
[1:41:53] <+Boner_Girl> no supers for gaara
[1:42:00] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @ChoculaUltra flashbacks to uraraka having that fight against bakugou, being cool that one time
[1:42:02] <+Xenstroke> @zyaksha i guess i was mostly referring to the insta meter fil keep away
[1:42:23] <%ChoculaUltra> you knew stealth wasn't going to be a big thing in the Naruto universe after seeing Naruto's bright orange jacket LUL
[1:42:25] <%Th3SmartAlec> @SixMillionDollarGamer Are you one of, or related to, one of these 10 people? No? You don't matter.
[1:42:28] <+Jaysky> @choculaultra Yeah.She went from that to nearly dying to her future husband
[1:42:50] <CyrusVGZ> Stealth still matters in Naruto when you aren't dealing with the god level shinobi. Stealth means nothing when someone can sense your chakra.
[1:42:55] <SableS139a> @nailwind Fucking hell... You have a pait of Mystic Eyes that allow you to see just about anything, and yet you only use them for fisticuffs. Powerful fisticuffs mind you, but there's so much more that could've been done.
[1:43:11] <+Mendin> Listen, he sees the Lines and can cut them
[1:43:15] <DSD24> Mystic Eyes of Death Perception wait that's the wrong set of eyes
[1:43:22] <nailwind> @SableS139a The whole thing is one big waste of potential :/
[1:43:22] <SableS139a> k e k
[1:43:25] <hamahiroyuki> @sables139a I actually like hinata, i really do but being best girl in naruto really means anything?
[1:43:51] <%Th3SmartAlec> @SableS139a You mean how every fight with an Uchiha on one side should end with an insta-kill Genjutsu?
[1:43:56] <+Jaysky> In close combat Neji disabling his opponent is pretty great for capturing the enemy for interrogation, buuut that's not really used
[1:43:57] <+Mendin> Reggie try 8.A
[1:44:12] <SableS139a> At least in the case of the Shiki's their Mystic Eyes being kinda limited makes sense because y'know, complete destruction and all that jazz. There's no fucking excuse for the Byakugan of all things.
[1:44:17] <gulthrax> is this Woolie's disciple?
[1:44:34] <gunstars20> LUL
[1:44:35] <%Th3SmartAlec> YOINK

[1:44:57] <DSD24> Isn't the Hand of his Mom actually?
[1:45:04] <andre11dr> I mean Kishimoto did kinda just made a bunch of shit up as he went along, it's not like Oda who allegedly has everything mapped out
[1:45:15] <+LuckyRoooooo> yea @DSD24
[1:45:27] <elpollobosso> thats a lot of hits
[1:45:27] <%ChoculaUltra> you can tell Kishi started winging shit after the 5 Kage summit arc LUL
[1:45:27] <nailwind> POCKET SAND
[1:45:32] <DSD24> @LuckyRoooooo Always liked that plot point
[1:45:39] <+SixMillionDollarGamer> Imagine a version of Naruto where each Kekkai Genkai was used just half as interestingly as stands in Jojo

[1:46:31] <CyrusVGZ> We gotta be honest though. We don't know how much was Kishimoto and how much was the Editor interfering. I've heard a lot that Sakura wasn't going to get with Sasuke but his editor said he should do it.
[1:46:32] <Zayasu> D:

[1:47:30] <PhDream> Akamaru is banned in competitive play yes @LuckyRoooooo
[1:47:30] <DSD24> Remember TenTen made that big cheat machine during that Ninja Test that one time?

[1:47:36] <%Th3SmartAlec> @SableS139a They introduced Tailed Weapons... and didn't have her use them. Jebaited
[1:47:36] <HeroicVanguard> Tenten probably one of the better ones for fighting him
[1:47:36] <biomegabear> Ninja girl who's gimick is summoning weapons to throw. use it
[1:47:36] <+Mendin> Tenten gets a glowup in the Wii GNT games, actually
[1:47:39] <Super_Voltekka> Tenten was supposed to be the Lei-Lei of the Naruto world
[1:47:44] <+LuckyRoooooo> doodLUL
[1:47:48] <Flamethrowerman09> Team Asuma was the only other team that got consistent attention in the series.

[1:47:53] <+Jaysky> Hey at least Tenten was hot. Her Shippuden outfit was killer
[1:47:59] <hamahiroyuki> @andre11dr all week mangaka has to do that as a second nature but like, certain things in nart didnt even feel had a short term plan tho
[1:48:03] <+pleadv> If only her specialty wasn't throwing kunai, the thing that never works
[1:48:17] <%ChoculaUltra> the best arc in Shippudden was the Team Asuma revenge arc and I will die on this hill.
[1:48:18] <SableS139a> @Super_Voltekka More Lei-Lei/Hsien-Ko is always appreciated.
[1:48:19] <+SpicyNipples_> jump super on tenten
[1:48:19] <Solidnick18> LUL
[1:48:22] <+Boner_Girl> To be fair, Tenten would canonically be beaten by a dog
[1:48:25] <majinken> @ozmon remember in that rock Lee special he blatantly says "zoom in so Tenten is out of the shot" 🤣
[1:48:26] <SableS139a> @Jaysky You're not wrong...
[1:48:27] <nailwind> @ChoculaUltra you won't die on it alone
[1:48:39] <+Goku01899> John Wick approved
[1:48:40] <%Th3SmartAlec> Imagine Tenten but instead she got the Gates of Babylon

[1:50:09] <%Th3SmartAlec> Best. Girl.
[1:50:11] <SableS139a> @pleadv Was there any reason why the kunai used in-universe is specifically the type made with digging and climbing in mind instead of PROPER throwing kunai? That's always been a pet peeve of mine.
[1:50:14] <agadejobi> Ramen Ichiraku night!
[1:50:15] <biomegabear> ROLF
[1:50:15] <nailwind> @Thatnerdyrunner salty bet better have this match

[1:50:35] <%ChoculaUltra> super bummed we never got a Kakashi Gaiden during his Anbu days with like a young Gai and Asuma FeelsBadMan
[1:50:37] <+LuckyRoooooo> temari of course lol
[1:50:37] <+Thatnerdyrunner> isint Haku busted in this game?
[1:50:38] <Flamethrowerman09> Temari was even more wasted than Tenten.
[1:50:38] <Memitim> pls no senbon loops
[1:50:40] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> YEEEEEEE
[1:50:40] <Mothman742> Ok chat, what's worse? Have a character come out like ten ten and be a character that u kno could be cool if the writer was better OR be like rock lee where u KNO he IS cool af be ut writer can never bring out the best of him?
[1:50:41] <+thegreenbenis> Haku is best girl/
[1:50:57] <Flamethrowerman09> Boy
[1:50:58] <+SpicyNipples_> haku not a girl .-.
[1:50:59] <SableS139a> @Mothman742 Y E S
[1:51:01] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Flamethrowerman09 Holy shit man, that's too brutal
[1:51:02] <DSD24> @Mothman742 Definitely the Ladder
[1:51:07] <DSD24> I mean Latter
[1:51:07] <HeroicVanguard> Haku is a glass cannon
[1:51:15] <%Th3SmartAlec> @SpicyNipples_ (that's the jooooooke)
[1:51:15] <%ggbhtg> She got fly mixups, Temari DID get buffs in this hack doodLUL @WoolieVersus
[1:51:18] <Flamethrowerman09> At least Temari was cool, unlike Tenten.
[1:51:19] <nailwind> @Mothman742 the Lee case, because then you've actually gotten SOMETHING out of it
[1:51:21] <audibleellipsis> @Mothman742 for sure the rock lee issue
[1:51:22] <Dave_VD> @Flamethrowerman09 She at least got to do stuff like leading soldiers against madara
[1:51:24] <%eyezehuhh> TransgenderPride
[1:51:31] <+Jaysky> @mothman742 Rock Lee cause we know he's cool despite him not looking "cool"
[1:51:32] <%ggbhtg> FLY MORE WOOLIE
[1:51:34] <townzzzzz> ride the wind
[1:51:35] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Dave_VD Oh yes, that helped LUL
[1:51:47] <%ggbhtg> FLY A LOT MORE WOOLIE, SHE GOT MIXUPS @WoolieVersus
[1:51:47] <+SpicyNipples_> Haku Jump A and hold it
[1:51:55] <Jrocy247> brutal
[1:51:56] <hamahiroyuki> @flamethrowerman09 she got be the best girl BECAUSE author didnt do anything with her
[1:52:01] <%Th3SmartAlec> When she whips TenTen's ass, yeah
[1:52:02] <%ChoculaUltra> Rock Lee's whole "hard work beats natural talent" schtick really helped me as a kid ngl
[1:52:12] <zyaksha> temari cheap LUL
[1:52:12] <+LuckyRoooooo> crazy how tenten basically was one shotted by temari lol
[1:52:17] <biomegabear> @Th3SmartAlec and breaks her spine
[1:52:19] <+Jaysky> The fact that Rock Lee became cool was purely his skill and enthusiasm. Not edgy design like Sasuke
[1:52:21] <+MoistBananaPudd> Is Woolie back in?
[1:52:25] <%Triforce505> what are the net stockings even useful for??
[1:52:29] <%eyezehuhh> @ChoculaUltra forvreal tho. should've been mc
[1:52:31] <%Th3SmartAlec> @ChoculaUltra Props for making that work. (Cause the story sure didn't!)
[1:52:32] <+Boner_Girl> Even though Rock Lee never won a battle
[1:52:38] <DSD24> @Triforce505 Style factor?
[1:52:41] <Mothman742> Tbh yall prob not even wrong picking lee's case but it always ALWAYS hurts me knowing some of his best fights are FUCKIN FILLERS
[1:52:45] <%ggbhtg> Woolie will always get Back In for Temari, chat
[1:52:49] <+thegreenbenis> @Triforce505 I think they are supposed to be chainmail, but Kishimoto is a hack.

[1:52:50] <SableS139a> @ChoculaUltra Yeah. Talent doesn't mean much of anything if you don't do anything to improve your skill set. Hard work pays off more often than not.
[1:52:58] <+Mendin> @WoolieVersus Reggie, use Haku's j.A and -hold- the A
[1:52:59] <+Jaysky> @boner_girl And yet he's still a badass
[1:53:05] <ozmon> Cool, Temari fan antizones
[1:53:11] <agadejobi> How come Temari doesn't have a last name?
[1:53:14] <CyrusVGZ> Let's not pretend Sasuke isn't cool though. Don't act like you weren't making AMVs of when he showed up in the black jump suit and did Chidori for the first time Kappa.
[1:53:24] <+LuckyRoooooo> temari Nara lol
[1:53:26] <%ggbhtg> @WoolieVersus charge your a move Reg!
[1:53:29] <SableS139a> @CyrusVGZ I was a little kid at the time, so no.
[1:53:31] <%ChoculaUltra> i don't think any of the Sand kids got last names now that I think about it
[1:53:37] <DSD24> Sidestepped!
[1:53:37] <%eyezehuhh> @agadejobi leaving a free space for Shikamaru
[1:53:39] <+Jaysky> I did really like Sasuke black suit look
[1:53:45] <+Battletankbob> dont forget the real-time supers
[1:53:51] <+EnemyViolent> dattebayo
[1:53:51] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:53:57] <nailwind> @Jaysky facts
[1:54:12] <DSD24> I didn't like the Black Suit cause I didn't get how he put it on
[1:54:13] <Memitim> @jaysky I liked it too until I realized it's a onesie
[1:54:15] <+SpicyNipples_> play sakura
[1:54:17] <+Battletankbob> doesn't tamari have a jump x?
[1:54:21] <+LuckyRoooooo> apparently kishi stopped using the black suit for sasuke because it took too much time
[1:54:23] <%CaptainPileDriver> where's the puppet
[1:54:23] <+Thatnerdyrunner> wait this game is in english?
[1:54:24] <zyaksha> Play Kankuro
[1:54:27] <%Th3SmartAlec> any difference between Kankuro and the puppet?
[1:54:27] <+pleadv> Lol I forgot Iruka is in this game
[1:54:29] <nailwind> @Memitim nevermind, you just ruined my life
[1:54:33] <+EnemyViolent> she said it
[1:54:34] <Solidnick18> shino
[1:54:35] <%CaptainPileDriver> PUPPET
[1:54:36] <Flamethrowerman09> I honestly thought that the black suit was kinda ugly. I liked the longer hair, though.
[1:54:39] <Solidnick18> yeeeee
[1:54:40] <@Menitta> Ino is fun as fuck in this game
[1:54:42] <Mothman742> Is this series basically just naruto's budokai/burst limit game?
[1:54:43] <emeraldskrull> if ino started dating naruto
[1:54:46] <Solidnick18> bug boy
[1:54:47] <DSD24> @nailwind Wait you didn't know?
[1:54:53] <HeroicVanguard> Ino is a FighterZ character now lmao
[1:54:54] <biomegabear> I feel like shino's bug stuff should be OP in the show
[1:54:55] <@Menitta> I may or may not have downloaded the rom just now and Ino is fun
[1:54:58] <nailwind> LUL I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT IT
[1:55:03] <+Battletankbob> remember shino's down x being good
[1:55:03] <+SpicyNipples_> ino yuck
[1:55:04] <%CaptainPileDriver> this series is still fun
[1:55:08] <Flamethrowerman09> Why does a 12 year old like Shino have a voice that deep?
[1:55:11] <+EnemyViolent> He's got fart clouds
[1:55:12] <nfsman34> @Th3SmartAlec Picking Kankuro has both Kank and the puppet. Picking the puppet means you play as the puppet solo.
[1:55:13] <zyaksha> ino trash
[1:55:13] <DSD24> The bees!
[1:55:16] <LunarFlash> Swagged out Shino, with the all black
[1:55:22] <%Th3SmartAlec> @nfsman34 ah, thanks
[1:55:26] <+Jaysky> @biomegabear It would be. It's great for stealth and he can literally kill from the inside out
[1:55:33] <majinken> not the 🐝
[1:55:35] <%ChoculaUltra> which of the Naruto cast had the best pre-timeskip to Shippudden character design glow-up?
[1:55:37] <Flamethrowerman09> Shino's another wasted character after his fight with Kankuro.
[1:55:38] <nailwind> Shino so busted they took him out of the story
[1:55:43] <@Menitta> @WoolieVersus Good Ino combo: 2A, B, B
[1:55:44] <andre11dr> Temari Gara and Shikamaru are probably my favorite and i kinda wish they where in a better anime
[1:55:45] <biomegabear> @Jaysky yeah its cool
[1:55:45] <lem______> it would be a shame if shino ended up lame in the future......
[1:55:45] <townzzzzz> the creep and crawl
[1:55:47] <Solidnick18> Les gooooo
[1:55:59] <Jrocy247> It's crazy how underused Shino is
[1:56:01] <Super_Voltekka> Ino invented the bodyswap fetish
[1:56:02] <Solidnick18> yo wtf
[1:56:02] <DSD24> I liked the Hoodie look for Shino
[1:56:03] <Flamethrowerman09> Shame because he dominated everyone he fought against.
[1:56:13] <+Mendin> Shino'a 2a and 8a are also potent
[1:56:20] <%Th3SmartAlec> Bugs, another thing that should be OP as fuck but is locked to a Side Character. Maybe if his mosquitoes had hundreds of Sharingans... NotLikeThis
[1:56:24] <Memitim> I was rewatching part 1 and it's actually crazy how hyped up Shino was
[1:56:35] <Mothman742> Wasnt shino op af everytime he fought someone not important?
[1:56:43] <@Menitta> Yeah pretty much
[1:56:43] <+SpicyNipples_> shino got done so dirty in boruto
[1:56:46] <@Menitta> He was amazing
[1:56:48] <nailwind> Yeah, Shino is super overpowered
[1:56:48] <Viktor616> @Mothman742 Yes
[1:56:49] <%ChoculaUltra> Shino would've made the Save Sasuke arc a fucking joke LUL
[1:56:51] <+Jaysky> @mothman742 Pretty much.
[1:56:58] <Flamethrowerman09> Kiba was also done dirty.
[1:57:08] <%ChoculaUltra> his bugs could've literally ate Kimimaro from the inside with how much he opens his own body up.
[1:57:10] <+SpicyNipples_> kiba was always useless
[1:57:15] <Memitim> Even during the Sasuke Retrieval Arc, Naruto was like "Uhm, shouldn't we bring Shino?"
[1:57:16] <CyrusVGZ> Kiba had cool skills but he was just Naruto with a dog.
[1:57:19] <zyaksha> kiba is lowkey weak asf
[1:57:23] <nailwind> Shino boutta summon Arakune
[1:57:25] <+Dova573> man I played the shit naruto shippuden ninja clash revolution 4 tm on my wii
[1:57:25] <+SpicyNipples_> lost to no chakra naruto
[1:57:26] <ozmon> lol he literally ends facing away
[1:57:28] <+pleadv> Remember that time Kiba got farted on and lost
[1:57:29] <Mothman742> And wasnt one of danzos bodyguards just a stronger version of shino?
[1:57:41] <brutalmoon2> Kiba dope af in this game
[1:57:42] <Flamethrowerman09> He also never won a single fight in the series. And neither did Lee
[1:57:43] <+Jaysky> @memitim Nah,they didn't want to BUG him
[1:57:44] <brutalmoon2> He has sick crossups
[1:57:44] <DSD24> For the longest time I thought Kiba had really long hair but it was just his hoodie
[1:57:46] <zyaksha> it was shinos brother
[1:57:56] <%ChoculaUltra> Danzo's Sharingarm is my favorite dumbest thing in the whole series LUL
[1:57:58] <+thegreenbenis> Teleports behind you
[1:58:03] <+SpicyNipples_> shino brother had a if i touch you its gg
[1:58:08] <andre11dr> Shino is like the Fugo of Naruto where's like, "fuck we can't have you around you to much because your powers are really op"
[1:58:21] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Memitim The idea that "we can't spare ANYYYY adults to stop the Uchiha kid from leaving to Orochimaru" is so ludicrous. Not that any the adults were stronger than literal children, but still.
[1:58:23] <DSD24> The combos!
[1:58:48] <Solidnick18> eat bugs
[1:58:50] <Mothman742> Hell didnt shino beat danzo's bodyguard too when he cameback during the war? AND REALLY FAST TOO?
[1:58:51] <DerpioParty> Not the bees!
[1:58:53] <majinken> @woolieversus iirc you can juggle with the bugs on the ground
[1:59:01] <CyrusVGZ> The best part of any battle shonen is when the power levels jump the shark. That's literally the best part. If you don't like that part then go read shojo manga or something lol.
[1:59:02] <%ChoculaUltra> would've loved to see the adults fight kids during the Save Sasuke arc LUL
[1:59:04] <+Jaysky> Imagine Naruto charging up his rasengan only for the guy he's monologing to gets eaten by fucking bugs
[1:59:09] <%Triforce505> bleeding blue, must be chakra
[1:59:16] <elpollobosso> LOL
[1:59:29] <Flamethrowerman09> How cool would Ino and Sakura be if they could do even half of the video game exclusive techniques in the actual series?
[1:59:35] <andre11dr> Who?
[1:59:41] <DSD24> Anko has that good redesign in Boruto right?
[1:59:48] <+Dova573> I member Hidan and asuma being fun
[1:59:51] <HeroicVanguard> ANKO HYPE AS HELL
[1:59:53] <@Menitta> Anko is cool
[1:59:53] <+SixMillionDollarGamer> I forget Anko exists far too often
[1:59:54] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Jaysky Ok. Let's think. What defense does end-of-Shippuden Naruto have against Shino's bugs? Besides the plot armor?
[1:59:55] <%ChoculaUltra> its also really bad how Tsunade handled that shit as Hokage. You got 1 of the last 2 known existing pairs of Sharingan just leaving your village and you send 5 fucking kids to handle it LUL
[1:59:59] <PhDream> Noooooope Lol @DSD24
[2:00:02] <andre11dr> I always forget this caracter exists
[2:00:05] <PhDream> They made Anko fat in Boruto
[2:00:05] <%CaptainPileDriver> CaptainPileDriver is continuing the Gift Sub they got from Theycallmenerf!
[2:00:05] <townzzzzz> the true enemy FOOD
[2:00:07] <Memitim> @dsd24 I mean she got fat, which is cool I guess.
[2:00:09] <@Menitta> YO
[2:00:12] <%gatorafan> Anko FeelsBadMan
[2:00:17] <Mothman742> Bruh shino, shikimaru, lee, temari are all characters who deserved better
[2:00:19] <SableS139a> >feelsbadman
[2:00:21] <DerpioParty> So is Anko using Vice/Mature's weird nail swipes?
[2:00:21] <CyrusVGZ> I'd raw dog Anko regardless. Fat or not.
[2:00:22] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Anko used to look so cool
[2:00:26] <majinken> Anko has a better special in EX special
[2:00:27] <wakeuplvl3> woolie hit 2X with anko
[2:00:29] <PhDream> Anko has sauce in this game
[2:00:31] <Pookiedaexzile> THE MIX
[2:00:33] <+pleadv> The growing trend in chat is "I forgot this character existed, why didn't they do anything cool" which is a shame
[2:00:41] <andre11dr> Her and Tsunade helper arw in the same D class of no attention characters
[2:00:41] <raichu1972> Anko def has the art design of a shounen antagonist
[2:00:46] <nailwind> damn shes popping off
[2:00:54] <+Jaysky> @th3smartalec I think one tailed Naruto had an aura that would cancel them out if they tried to contact him so possibly that if he let's his guard down
[2:00:54] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:01:01] <DSD24> That was a cool throw
[2:01:02] <PhDream> Anko has three supers tho.
[2:01:06] <%ChoculaUltra> you would think with the War Arc Kishi would've had time to give everyone some shine but nope - totally had to have 20 chapters of Naruto and KB vs the world
[2:01:08] <%Th3SmartAlec> @ChoculaUltra She herself could and should have just popped her forehead thing, sprint like a MF-er to catch up, and crushed Sasuke into the earth. And popped his eyes too to be sure
[2:01:08] <Mothman742> @pleadv blame kishimoto for not writing good
[2:01:09] <PhDream> They just aren't using them.
[2:01:22] <+Battletankbob> anko's other x has a cutscene
[2:01:28] <BaslerJones> kreygasm
[2:01:31] <%ChoculaUltra> @Th3SmartAlec EXACTLY
[2:01:32] <PhDream> Anko's Down X has a cutscene.
[2:01:34] <@Menitta> yeyeye
[2:01:38] <+thegreenbenis> Anko appears to be naked under that trench coat.
[2:01:42] <+pleadv> Yeah thats the saddest part. Most of the characters have a cool design or abilities
[2:01:46] <Dante_Namikaze1> Ammo was hot
[2:01:50] <%ChoculaUltra> Tsunade could've ground stomped and killed like 3 of the Sound 5 LUL
[2:01:50] <nailwind> Anko is a trench coat flasher
[2:01:54] <CyrusVGZ> Also let's be fair: Anko is probably pushing 40-50 in Boruto.
[2:01:56] <Dante_Namikaze1> *Anko
[2:01:58] <SableS139a> @raichu1972 You could probably stick Anko in just about any major or significant position in a Shounen series and she'd work well regardless. Her design's that good.
[2:01:58] <zyaksha> ammo LUL
[2:02:02] <deafmelone> We doing tag mode?
[2:02:16] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Jaysky I said besides plot armor Kappa . But fair, I'll take that the Nine Tails has bug chakra sensors.
[2:02:28] <+thegreenbenis> @WoolieVersus You back in?
[2:02:32] <andre11dr> I feel like being hot is the only reason people kinda remember her
[2:02:32] <MutedMimic> 🐀
[2:02:32] <SableS139a> @nailwind Facts
[2:02:36] <@Menitta> Nah Pat is wrong
[2:02:45] <%CaptainPileDriver> yes but pat also has to have a hot take per week
[2:02:48] <+Jaysky> @th3smartalec Naruto is plot armor itself so that'd be hard Kappa
[2:02:49] <Zayasu> bayo 1 seems better yeah
[2:02:51] <%Irridium> Bayo 2 still slaps
[2:02:53] <CyrusVGZ> When is Pat not wrong? lol
[2:02:54] <%Zero_Jacks> psaCrazyhead
[2:02:58] <+thegreenbenis> Pat is always wrong, especially when he's right.
[2:03:02] <%ChoculaUltra> I mean you can't just have hot ninja babes and not use them and not expect to be called out by your readers LUL
[2:03:08] <@Menitta> ESPECIALLY when he's right
[2:03:16] <@Solidus_113> Skull still around LUL
[2:03:21] <%CaptainPileDriver> ye
[2:03:24] <nailwind> never let Pat feel righr
[2:03:25] <%jinking79> honestly Pat will buy a $5 game just for a laugh
[2:03:39] <andre11dr> I mean, so would i
[2:03:43] <@Menitta> I wonder how bad this will be if I use a gamecube controller
[2:03:48] <majinken> @menitta his stand acting up again? lol
[2:04:03] <~WoolieVersus> https://parsec.gg/g/1kqg1jyMZxgFVbcW9eROpSy4YBs/cdf36d4a/
[2:04:06] <Prevot> pat's bayo2 opinion is literally just parroting people who went "ACKSHUALLY bayo 2 sucks" to him
[2:04:12] <CyrusVGZ> This is gonna go smoothly Kappa
[2:04:14] <andre11dr> I listen to terrible music just to laugh at it
[2:04:19] <%Th3SmartAlec> Okay. Let's think about THIS. Kakashi is proof that the Sharingan can be used by ANYONE. The Uchiha's abilities are tied directly to their eyeballs, they're basically walking eyeball factories. Danzo had a good idea going.
[2:04:41] <+pleadv> My special eyes
[2:04:42] <%ChoculaUltra> I've listened to some of Corey Feldman's music just for the laughs
[2:04:50] <hadoking2> ABBOCK???
[2:04:52] <nailwind> @Th3SmartAlec Hooray for Sharingan Capitalism
[2:04:53] <+Jaysky> Danzo jogged all the good eyeballs to himself
[2:04:56] <zyaksha> ABBOCK? LMAO
[2:04:59] <Flamethrowerman09> I think it costs more chakra for non-Uchihas to use the Sharingan
[2:05:02] <+Jaysky> *hogged
[2:05:03] <%Th3SmartAlec> @pleadv Your special eyes? *Rips them out* MY special eyes.
[2:05:06] <+Cirby64> CELL GAMES?
[2:05:06] <+SpicyNipples_> ABBOCK LMAO
[2:05:07] <CyrusVGZ> Sharingan would fuck you up if you don't have good chakra control though. Especially if you took your sharingan because then it's always active.
[2:05:11] <+SpicyNipples_> RIP
[2:05:11] <Mothman742> @Th3SmartAlec too bad greedyass danzo monopolized the eyes
[2:05:12] <brutalmoon2> NOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[2:05:14] <+pleadv> Okay but what does the Rinnegan even do? HOW DOES IT WORK?
[2:05:16] <SableS139a> ABBOCK LMAO

[2:15:22] <%CaptainPileDriver> someone wanna post the link one more time
[2:15:23] <brutalmoon2> Yes I use it all the time for Gotcha Force netplay
[2:15:29] <brutalmoon2> Its that he doesnt have the GC Controller driver for pc
[2:15:38] <brutalgenie> Sakura worst girl
[2:15:42] <CyrusVGZ> Gotcha Force. That's a name I haven't heard in a long time.
[2:15:50] <+pleadv> Is there a Zoids Battle Legends netplay scene?
[2:15:52] <brutalmoon2> I love that game. I made a competitive edit of it
[2:15:58] <brutalmoon2> Gotcha Force I mean
[2:16:06] <KingDanieltheDandy> Still pretty lame people are still talking trash on arena fighting games. I understand why, but it's still unfortunate.
[2:16:07] <%ggbhtg> @brutalmoon2 So your controller isn't being mapped through Parsec directly?
[2:16:11] <nailwind> LUL last time I ever saw Gotcha Force was with Jerma streaming
[2:16:13] <brutalmoon2> Yeah
[2:16:14] <+Mendin> Did Woolie pull out Temari tech all of a sudden?
[2:16:18] <+Jaysky> Is there netplay for Custom Robo?
[2:16:22] <DSD24> Yooo Zoids Battle Legends!

[2:16:49] <DSD24> Gotcha Force was Capcom right?
[2:16:56] <CyrusVGZ> @KingDanieltheDandy Arena fighting games are good. Just remember that you don't need esports for your game to thrive. Esports is not a real community lol.
[2:16:57] <+pleadv> I can't believe I had Gotcha Force as a kid. Its like super rare now
[2:17:01] <+Kefbar> it a game where you basicaly figth in toy gundams

[2:23:42] <%Th3SmartAlec> The person that Lee's return was wasted on
[2:23:50] <majinken> @mendin lol
[2:24:06] <andre11dr> It's sure nice that Jiraia chooses to not use Sage mode and just destroy everyone from og Naruto, even tho he totally can
[2:24:11] <+askalta> nice
[2:24:11] <+SpicyNipples_> PowerUpL OSFrog PowerUpR PowerUpL OSFrog PowerUpR
[2:24:12] <+paladinstarbuster> Kimimaro and his clan are the only mention of the name kaguya in original naruto before she is revealed
[2:24:12] <%Th3SmartAlec> Remember when Lee recovered from that spine injury to have a drunk fight and do nothing else ever again
[2:24:16] <Mothman742> Remember when they said kimimaru was related to kaguya?
[2:24:29] <Flamethrowerman09> Does anyone else find it funny that the only reason why Jiraiya even knows all these frog techniques if from messing up a summoning jutsu?
[2:24:31] <ExpressNode> Oh I just realized this version never came out in NA but the first two games did
[2:24:33] <+askalta> I dont remember a tail ever on this guy
[2:24:36] <%Th3SmartAlec> @paladinstarbuster "So why doesn't he have the special eyes?" "Shut up"
[2:24:45] <zyaksha> wheres paradise when you need him one of our best jiraiya players
[2:24:51] <%Jetzord> @Th3SmartAlec Hey man, he offered Neji a piggyback ride once
[2:24:59] <rosemon5001> the bones are from the same bloodline like kaguya
[2:25:07] <roarofdamnation> @Mothman742 You say that, but could Kimimaru defeat Madara Uchiha?
[2:25:07] <%gatorafan> But dionosaurs are COOL
[2:25:08] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Jetzord ...did he accept?
[2:25:13] <Arek_1> If your ribs are poking out like that, why wouldn't your tailbone extend out, too?
[2:25:15] <nailwind> calcium
[2:25:21] <majinken> @th3smartalec nope
[2:25:21] <@Menitta> YO
[2:25:27] <Flamethrowerman09> Kimimaro is like low-mid Jonin level.
[2:25:29] <%Th3SmartAlec> @majinken damn
[2:25:35] <%ggbhtg> UNFORTUNATELY yes chat, Kimimaro is related to Kaguya, thanks to retcons

[2:26:18] <CyrusVGZ> They said early on that Byakugan was related to Sharingan in OG Naruto.
[2:26:19] <+paladinstarbuster> His clan is but only tagentially
[2:26:24] <+Dova573> BUT ALIENS WOOLIE

[2:29:18] <%ggbhtg> I don't know nothing aside from what you've said about these games @WoolieVersus
[2:29:20] <Mothman742> Fun fact: reggie is a precious cinnamon roll
[2:29:23] <%ggbhtg> let's see some shit!
[2:29:36] <CyrusVGZ> We got a Neji player
[2:29:39] <PhDream> Iruka plays like Mizuki
[2:29:40] <+Jaysky> Oh boy Iruka
[2:29:51] <+Thatnerdyrunner> oh?
[2:29:53] <Solidnick18> alright iruka
[2:29:55] <Dante_Namikaze1> we have because he plays Mizuki
[2:29:58] <+SixMillionDollarGamer> Forgot Iruka had a last name
[2:30:09] <majinken> that's from double dash
[2:30:16] <CyrusVGZ> Picking a projectile character against Neji Kappa
[2:30:16] <Thunderhog> Dolphin fighting on a dolphin
[2:30:16] <ExpressNode> This stage looks like the thing from ballon battle on Mario kart
[2:30:32] <andre11dr> Iruka ,the fucking Mr Satan of Naruto
[2:30:40] <Mothman742> Remember when the byakugan was supposed to be better than the sharingan?? Lmfao at that shit
[2:30:45] <SableS139a> Hold up. Is the background for this map literally just Melee FD's?
[2:30:58] <rosemon5001> @SixMillionDollarGamer just call him iruka narutos step dad LUL dicLit
[2:31:02] <nailwind> so when is Byakugan getting a Susano'o?
[2:31:07] <+maxtheflea> Are they... fighting on a Gamecube stage..?
[2:31:14] <SableS139a> @maxtheflea Yessir
[2:31:22] <CyrusVGZ> @Mothman742 Sharingan was always better. Being able to read moves and copy jutsu > Seeing chakra points and far distances.
[2:31:23] <+Mendin> @nailwind Something something the moon something something the movie
[2:31:29] <+Jaysky> Base byakugan is better than base sharigan for multi purpose use
[2:31:36] <gunstars20> LUL
[2:31:38] <@Menitta> He's done that several times
[2:31:45] <+Thatnerdyrunner> @maxtheflea Yeah Dont you rememberb that part of the show? The Gamecube arc was where men cried
[2:32:09] <nailwind> @Thatnerdyrunner all the feelings are flooding back..
[2:32:12] <brutalmoon2> What about me? I lef tthe stream
[2:32:19] <majinken> the music sounds familiar
[2:32:20] <+NeonFishFace> iruka is still my fave character
[2:32:23] <brutalmoon2> @WoolieVersus IM BACK

[2:32:33] <CyrusVGZ> A basic level Sharingan made Kakashi a legendary ninja.
[2:32:34] <zyaksha> @brutalmoon2
[2:32:34] <%ggbhtg> GGs yo @WoolieVersus
[2:32:37] <PhDream> He said he'd be down to figure keyboard stuff with you Brutal
[2:32:37] <+maxtheflea> @Thatnerdyrunner Man, I heard Naruto filler was bad, but woof LUL
[2:32:42] <@Menitta> yeye get brutal in there
[2:32:44] <@Solidus_113> you might have to set binding
[2:32:44] <Mothman742> @CyrusVGZ pretty sure in the show someone deadass says that its better when neji first appears
[2:32:48] <ozmon> Who needs Iruka when we got MIZUKI THO
[2:32:50] <stinkydrink> is this that one naruto game with goku in it
[2:32:50] <andre11dr> Sunsano'o is kinda cool, i guess it is just a huge stand and HxH kinda already did that but better
[2:32:53] <rosemon5001> ohhh wow they even have that one ninja that made naruto steal the scroll
[2:32:53] <brutalmoon2> Default for dolphin
[2:32:53] <Arek_1> Because of their ability to see tenketsu, there should've been Hyuga medical ninja.
[2:32:57] <DaBigVitus> look at these fighting gamer faces
[2:33:12] <brutalmoon2> There is a default button
[2:33:17] <CyrusVGZ> @Mothman742 Kakashi said it but comparing them both side by side Sharingan is superior.
[2:33:23] <%ggbhtg> I never played Taisen, I was always waiting for you to show it off doodLUL @WoolieVersus
[2:33:25] <nailwind> privileged keyboard pass
[2:33:35] <+Mendin> the k-board pass

[2:33:44] <+Mendin> k-board premium
[2:33:53] <+Jaysky> @cyrusvgz In a fight? Sure. As an overall ninja tool? Byakugan is better.
[2:33:56] <DaBigVitus> is this the last naruto fighter without full free movement?
[2:33:57] <Mothman742> @CyrusVGZ OBVIOUSLY now we all kno that now
[2:34:11] <zyaksha> BRUTAL

[2:36:52] <+Mendin> BROKE YA NECK
[2:36:55] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @CaptainPileDriver I think there's one for the PSP? Don't quote me on this...
[2:36:57] <SableS139a> A Soul Eater fighting game would be cool to see.
[2:37:04] <+Thatnerdyrunner> ANIMAL CONTROL ON SPEED DIAL
[2:37:05] <smiggyballs13> Anybody catch tonight’s UFC?
[2:37:07] <DSD24> Yo he stylin!
[2:37:12] <%ggbhtg> @CaptainPileDriver Not while there isn't even a full anime of the manga
[2:37:13] <smiggyballs13> It was on FIRE 🔥
[2:37:37] <+LokimenD> Soul Eater Brotherhood would be so fucking cool
[2:37:41] <MutedMimic> LUL
[2:37:43] <%CaptainPileDriver> there is a soul eater fighting game
[2:37:48] <%CaptainPileDriver> on the ps2 it looks like
[2:37:48] <+Thatnerdyrunner> @Mothman742 SHikamaru for sure
[2:37:58] <+glassesaregod> I demand Temari jump A tech and Akamaru glitch tech SwiftRage
[2:38:00] <+LokimenD> Give my man Black Star the respect he deserves
[2:38:05] <+Jaysky> @Mothman742 Byakugan for starters
[2:38:26] <%ggbhtg> ACTUALLY, YEAH, any Temari mains in here?
[2:38:26] <+Thatnerdyrunner> @Mothman742 Plus I mean lee is just proto Deku
[2:38:34] <+Jaysky> Ino's body swap jutsu
[2:38:34] <%CaptainPileDriver> the ps2 soul eater fighting game looks really bad
[2:38:38] <Thunderhog> The panic super
[2:38:38] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[2:38:41] <DaBigVitus> @Mothman742 I feel like the shadow powers and bug powers could be wayyyy OP and interesting in a more assassination/spying setting
[2:38:42] <+glassesaregod> @ggbhtg HeyGuys
[2:38:48] <%ggbhtg> smol brain
[2:38:48] <CyrusVGZ> I'm of the opinion that anything good about Naruto should stay in Naruto because the way it is is what makes it special to me. /sentimental
[2:38:49] <+Jaysky> Shino's everything
[2:38:49] <ozmon> Why are my hands pressing these buttons?
[2:38:50] <%AlteisenReiseZ> All I know is that I would play Kilik Rung religiously if there was a proper Soul Eater fighting game
[2:38:50] <majinken> lol
[2:38:59] <DSD24> Wake up super!
[2:39:00] <+mauricefaurron> Wake up super in 2021 LUL
[2:39:06] <Mothman742> @Thatnerdyrunner i give shiki a pass since came out awesome despite not getting the spotlight all that often
[2:39:08] <+LokimenD> @Thatnerdyrunner Lee is better than Deku because he doesn't get a bullshit super power
[2:39:12] <+Mendin> Wake up ultra? Really mike ross?
[2:39:13] <Thunderhog> A 2D fighting stage in 3d
[2:39:14] <%ggbhtg> what is this, Tekken 7? doodLUL
[2:39:16] <+mauricefaurron> these are true mind games Kappa
[2:39:16] <+Jaysky> But I guess Shino's abilities are more skewed towards a villain role
[2:39:31] <%CaptainPileDriver> chat i'm not seeing a soul eater psp game
[2:39:33] <%kewlmyc> DOG COMBOS
[2:39:34] <%Triforce505> wahoo!
[2:39:43] <@Solidus_113> it was never localized
[2:39:47] <zyaksha> Brutal!
[2:40:08] <nailwind> LUL
[2:40:11] <+kennneh> I didn't know good games based on anime existed.
[2:40:11] <+glassesaregod> @woolieversus Temari has an air super btw. Jump X
[2:40:13] <%Jetzord> @CaptainPileDriver Soul Eater: Battle Resonance
[2:40:17] <Mothman742> @DaBigVitus isn't fushigoro from jujustu kaisen just a shikimaru with more fleshed out shadow powers?
[2:40:30] <+Mendin> Let's have an age check: Who in here still calls the projectiles in this game "shanks"
[2:40:36] <DaBigVitus> @Mothman742 I haven't seen that so can't say
[2:40:46] <ARFARFclem> this guy's got dog glitch !!
[2:40:48] <%CaptainPileDriver> @CaptainPileDriver that was a ps2 game
[2:40:53] <@Solidus_113> it's on both
[2:40:54] <+Jaysky> I've never heard the term shanks before
[2:40:59] <+vaporousTippler> Oooh, is this camera setup new, or have I missed too many shows?
[2:41:01] <+Jaysky> Not for this game anyway
[2:41:02] <stinkydrink> god dog
[2:41:07] <CyrusVGZ> I always called them kunai because I grew up watching a lot of Japanese media.
[2:41:23] <PhDream> Yeah kunai's are typically called shanks in the community sometimes @Jaysky
[2:41:27] <+Mendin> Maybe it was just a local meta thing but everyone's projectiles were just called shanks
[2:41:28] <PhDream> I've heard the term shanks a couple times.
[2:41:31] <Mothman742> @DaBigVitus recommend it heavily, especially if u wanted a better bleach
[2:41:36] <%kewlmyc> ....
[2:41:50] <zyaksha> Brutal is playing nerfed rn
[2:42:19] <+Thatnerdyrunner> @zyaksha he still has his weights on
[2:42:19] <HeroicVanguard> Keyboard play and one sided Parsec lag oof
[2:42:21] <+kewlmyc> yeah, playing with a keyboard sounds awkward
[2:42:52] <majinken> that was slick
[2:42:52] <stinkydrink> doggy :)
[2:42:55] <%ggbhtg> So, Ultimate Ninja probably would've fell into obscurity too tbh, if not for Storm coming out at the right time. Who in America even knows about Narutimate 4 and 5?
[2:42:58] <+Thatnerdyrunner> woolieCHAN
[2:43:10] <DaBigVitus> @Mothman742 have to say i dont watch much anime anymore. not seen a lot of things, even some classic ones. like bleach. I recently read the drifting classroom and that was awesome though
[2:43:11] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1348891911097110529?s=19
[2:43:19] <+LokimenD> Look at these jobbers
[2:43:22] <roarofdamnation> These rounds just make Kiba like he has a vendetta against blondes.
[2:43:28] <+Thatnerdyrunner> @ggbhtg me cause I was mad we never got narutimate 5
[2:43:42] <zyaksha> Ino in lag? is this the end for brutal
[2:43:48] <+glassesaregod> @ggbhtg Wait, there was a 4 and a 5? I knew there was a 3 for Narutimate, and that was when we were playing the JP version on a modified PS2
[2:43:48] <%ggbhtg> @Thatnerdyrunner Well, SOMEBODY did. EU, probably
[2:43:48] <DSD24> There's the swing!
[2:43:52] <DSD24> I sees it
[2:43:53] <Mothman742> @DaBigVitus ah i see, well i won't force or anything just a recommendation
[2:43:59] <CyrusVGZ> Which Naruto game on PS2 was it that had like an adventure mode where you walked around and did stuff? I liked that one.
[2:44:01] <nakunattakage> reggie limesPoggers
[2:44:03] <@Menitta> LUL
[2:44:06] <andre11dr> @ggbhtg I had 5
[2:44:12] <+Thatnerdyrunner> @ggbhtg yeah, US only got 4 and I loved it and was bummed cause 5 looked so cool
[2:44:18] <DSD24> Just like Bloody Roar
[2:44:26] <%ggbhtg> @CyrusVGZ Chronicles, or Dragon Blade, or some shit
[2:44:28] <HeroicVanguard> Turn Around no Jutsu
[2:44:34] <andre11dr> You didn't miss much LUL
[2:44:34] <+Jaysky> A friend of mine had the Naruto games on PS2 and I always thought those looked cool cause it had so many characters and cool interactions
[2:44:40] <+Mendin> Or run like hell (forward) to get away if turned
[2:44:59] <majinken> about face no jutsu
[2:45:06] <+Mendin> Dog zoning
[2:45:11] <zyaksha> or if your itachi just run away j.A
[2:45:13] <andre11dr> Also i didn't knew Narutimate 4 and 5 where EU only thing explains alot
[2:45:14] <CyrusVGZ> Might have been Chronicles. I remember starting the game and Naruto wasn't wearing his jacket so he had the black t-shirt and orange pants. The fit was clean.
[2:45:29] <%ggbhtg> US got Ultimate Ninja 4
[2:45:31] <+Thatnerdyrunner> @andre11dr nah 4 came out in the US
[2:45:36] <+Thatnerdyrunner> 5 was exclusive
[2:45:40] <%ggbhtg> it was late AF tho
[2:45:41] <nailwind> Reggie feels it
[2:45:47] <+Mendin> Reggie found the Ino buttons
[2:45:48] <+Mendin> hell yeah
[2:45:49] <+Thatnerdyrunner> yeah true like PS3 was out
[2:46:00] <%ggbhtg> Storm 1 already existed by the time UN4 came out
[2:46:11] <%ggbhtg> sooo UN5 had no chance
[2:46:14] <Mothman742> Naruto always looked better with designs that deviated from his original design
[2:46:32] <+Thatnerdyrunner> @Mothman742 I loved his movie outfit tbh where he has no sleeves
[2:46:41] <Dante_Namikaze1> Ultimate Ninja 5 never made it outside of Japan and Europe
[2:46:43] <nakunattakage> LUL
[2:46:45] <CyrusVGZ> Except that monster hunter clone. I hated those designs.
[2:46:46] <DSD24> That's still a neat super
[2:46:48] <+Dova573> what I give for a fun or competitive One piece fighting game
[2:46:50] <%ggbhtg> ASSIST, OK
[2:46:56] <Mothman742> @Thatnerdyrunner that shit do be indeed clean
[2:46:56] <majinken> @thatnerdyrunner got a copy of ultimate ninja 4 at a anime expo
[2:47:00] <DaBigVitus> whats the point of the swap in the super?
[2:47:03] <ozmon> Wait, what did she accomplish there?
[2:47:04] <+Dova573> 'and/or
[2:47:11] <+pleadv> Grand Adventure isn't even as fun as this
[2:47:17] <%ggbhtg> @DaBigVitus Stun probably
[2:47:19] <2dere> yay I was waiting for Woolie to find this gem
[2:47:21] <+Mendin> Forward and back
[2:47:26] <nakunattakage> @ozmon she controls their body to hold them still for a critical blow
[2:47:29] <PhDream> She swaps the body, calls someone, then swaps out at the last second for someone to hit the opponent for free.
[2:47:30] <+pleadv> The mind transfer was a stun
[2:47:32] <PhDream> Keeps them still basically
[2:47:34] <%ggbhtg> @2dere FIND?! He's ALWAYS known
[2:47:38] <+Infernal_Dalek> Love this game. I really loved playing Shikamaru, they play him yet?
[2:47:42] <+glassesaregod> Kiba was main all through GNT2, and then I co-mained him and Temari from 3 onwards. So seeing the cannonball shenanigans is very nostalgic for me :D
[2:47:42] <+Mendin> @2dere Woolie owns all four GNT games and has just been slow-rolling this one for us
[2:47:44] <+pleadv> Essentially like how its used in the show
[2:47:47] <DSD24> Nooo
[2:47:52] <ARFARFclem> LMAO
[2:47:52] <Sol_Install> the CHOKE
[2:47:52] <DSD24> Reggie almost had it
[2:47:53] <%ggbhtg> HOW SWAY
[2:47:56] <+Thatnerdyrunner> I remember loving Zabuza in these games
[2:47:58] <+veltish> it's like how one piece has great musou games
[2:47:58] <nailwind> sandwiched
[2:48:00] <2dere> @ggbhtg touche
[2:48:00] <ozmon> lol okay, it doesn't look like last second to me, it just looks like she calls them, swaps back and watches sensei body them
[2:48:00] <townzzzzz> reggie....
[2:48:01] <%Jetzord> So close
[2:48:02] <%ggbhtg> STAY WOKE, DON'T CHOKE
[2:48:03] <zyaksha> BRUTAL DID IT THROUGH THE LAG
[2:48:03] <pi_in_the_sci> this is my favorite naruto game
[2:48:05] <Mothman742> Wasnt they're a game like this but for shippuden on the DS?
[2:48:11] <PhDream> Not bad for playing on Keyboard, Brutal
[2:48:12] <+veltish> imagine an arcsys one piece
[2:48:20] <brutalmoon2> THAT WAS SO MUCH FUN!
[2:48:21] <+Thatnerdyrunner> @Mothman742 I think so and an OG series on too
[2:48:25] <andre11dr> This why we need a Jump All Star Arcsis made game chat
[2:48:25] <@Menitta> https://parsec.app/join/1kqg1jyMZxgFVbcW9eROpSy4YBs/c6c01177
[2:48:26] <@Solidus_113> remember to change controls back
[2:48:28] <+pleadv> Too bad One Piece doesn't have DFO money
[2:48:29] <ARFARFclem> <3 <3 brutal <3 <3
[2:48:29] <brutalmoon2> Im glad the keyboard controls helped make the match easier for you
[2:48:37] <brutalmoon2> Thank you!
[2:48:37] <nailwind> good stuff brutal
[2:48:37] <@Menitta> Oh yeah change controls back
[2:48:40] <+Thatnerdyrunner> good stuff brutal
[2:48:41] <majinken> lol
[2:48:42] <%ggbhtg> Change them Dolphin controls and shiiit
[2:48:48] <%ggbhtg> THE GRIME doodLUL
[2:48:50] <GeltonZ> @veltish Very possible, they made one on 3DS but it didn't get a US release. You can even play their One Piece 3DS fighter versus their DBZ 3DS fighter because it's the same engine.
[2:48:55] <%CaptainPileDriver> called out reggie
[2:48:56] <+Dova573> using xbox controller
[2:48:56] <Mothman742> @Thatnerdyrunner yea i remember 4 tailed naruto was op af
[2:48:58] <pi_in_the_sci> if you turn you back to the opponent as itachi, all his clones hit your opponents back
[2:49:03] <zyaksha> now we wait for our next player Hadoking

[2:49:18] <Dante_Namikaze1> @geltonz they made four on the DS two for original and two for Shippuden
[2:49:18] <+Thatnerdyrunner> anyone else want a MHA game like this?
[2:49:19] <@Menitta> you used him when figuring out controls
[2:49:19] <Super_Voltekka> No Choji either

[2:49:30] <+Mendin> We had a Kimi 2-3 players ago
[2:49:31] <roarofdamnation> Well it would be kind of hard to mess a Warriors games, so at least One Piece has that. But what i want is a good One Piece open world adventure game.
[2:49:32] <+offbeatninja123> whoo?!
[2:49:33] <%CaptainPileDriver> FUCK THOSE 2 LITTLE SHITS
[2:49:37] <nakunattakage> limesThink did I miss some garaa action already?

[2:50:38] <+glassesaregod> The hilarious thing about Naruto in this game is that he was way more interesting than the anime/manga LMAO
[2:50:40] <PhDream> Yeah, aggressive glass cannon Naruto
[2:50:42] <%ggbhtg> I believe in Reggie, fuck yall
[2:50:48] <zyaksha> oh god OTK
[2:50:48] <%CaptainPileDriver> reggie ruined this naruto game by picking naruto
[2:50:55] <CyrusVGZ> I was supposed to be grinding PSO2 and taking pictures in FF14 but here I am watching Woolie and Reggie GNT4 for hours. I don't regret it.
[2:50:57] <PhDream> @AlteisenReiseZ OTK is banned in vanilla, not in Super.
[2:50:59] <biomegabear> fox run'
[2:51:01] <%ggbhtg> @CaptainPileDriver Oh wait, you right, fuck em LUL
[2:51:01] <+LuckyRoooooo> Whats wrong with otk?
[2:51:07] <PhDream> OTK has been toned down quite a bit in Super
[2:51:07] <zyaksha> kakashi could hit OTK with a mcdonalds napkin and do half his HP
[2:51:13] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @PhDream Ah
[2:51:13] <+veltish> @roarofdamnation berserk did
[2:51:15] <+Goku01899> Dattebayo Kreygasm
[2:51:16] <+Mendin> OTK is now properly Akuma'd in super
[2:51:16] <ozmon> At least Reggie's still doin Evil Ryu, and not Ryu
[2:51:17] <townzzzzz> noice
[2:51:18] <+Mendin> Big Damage, Low Life
[2:51:19] <SableS139a> I'm a fan of that throw
[2:51:19] <HeroicVanguard> In Vanilla he has the most health and oppressive offense
[2:51:32] <PhDream> ^
[2:51:34] <+LuckyRoooooo> So otk is akuma
[2:51:40] <zyaksha> in vanilla OTK is busted
[2:51:44] <PhDream> In Super he is, yeah @LuckyRoooooo
[2:51:45] <zyaksha> in super he is alot less busted
[2:51:51] <+glassesaregod> Wait. When you guys are saying Vanilla, and Super, are you saying there's a SUPER GNT4!?
[2:51:51] <andre11dr> Man Jump Force was a pile of shit
[2:51:58] <TheGershon> Doesn't he also passively gain health, or is that someone else?
[2:52:01] <+Jaysky> Sure was
[2:52:05] <andre11dr> Didn't even had Bobobobo
[2:52:05] <TheGershon> in vanilla
[2:52:07] <PhDream> Kabuto @TheGershon
[2:52:08] <biomegabear> @andre11dr and bad load times
[2:52:10] <2dere> @glassesaregod this is a fan mod
[2:52:12] <Jrocy247> Naruto 1 he was busted
[2:52:13] <SomersaultJustice> at least ryo saeba was in it
[2:52:14] <+glassesaregod> Ah...
[2:52:21] <nfsman34> @LuckyRoooooo Yeah, now at least. In the original game, he was basically Akuma, if Akuma had Zangief's HP.
[2:52:28] <hadoking2> @TheGershon Someone else. The regular naruto transformation
[2:52:29] <majinken> @andre11dr jump force is getting Giovanna
[2:52:29] <andre11dr> Bobobobo is the goat
[2:52:31] <%ggbhtg> die for the super Kappa
[2:52:31] <+glassesaregod> @2dere so basically the PM of GNT4?
[2:52:31] <+LuckyRoooooo> im guessing in super he had one hit kill combos?
[2:52:34] <ozmon> That was a SATISFYING kick
[2:52:38] <+paladinstarbuster> if reggie loses its woolies fault
[2:52:41] <nailwind> KANCHOU
[2:52:46] <+paladinstarbuster> LUL

[2:53:14] <%ggbhtg> Alt super was Down X, I know Neji has Kaiten
[2:53:18] <2dere> @glassesaregod you got it, with a really active discord and online scene
[2:53:20] <PhDream> Nah, this is super where he's been toned down his health and whanot. In vanilla GNT4, he has the most health and has the most oppressive pressure in the game. @LuckyRoooooo
[2:53:21] <zyaksha> i never wanna see OTK win
[2:53:27] <PhDream> And his damage output was actually INSANE
[2:53:29] <%ggbhtg> REGULAR NALT, EW
[2:53:31] <+Jaysky> No sealed Sasuke?
[2:53:33] <%CaptainPileDriver> reggie ruined the stream
[2:53:34] <%ggbhtg> HE PICKIN RYU
[2:53:36] <Jrocy247> Man I defiantly remember playing this game around the time I was 14 years old.
[2:53:39] <%ggbhtg> HE PICKIN RYU, AS USUAL @WoolieVersus
[2:53:39] <DSD24> Purple Stuff Naruto
[2:53:46] <+glassesaregod> @2dere I gotta check it out. The last time I got to enjoy a lot of this FG series was when I was still in college.
[2:53:51] <nailwind> sleeveless is tight
[2:53:52] <biomegabear> purple is very ninja
[2:53:55] <andre11dr> Another thing I'll give Shippuden, Rasen Shuriken was a pretty cool upgrade
[2:54:00] <DSD24> Purple is better than Orange
[2:54:01] <TheGershon> Summer Naruto I think
[2:54:02] <%ggbhtg> LUCKILY, we haven't see normal wack ass Nalt
[2:54:05] <Dante_Namikaze1> it's from the third movie but in purple
[2:54:06] <rosemon5001> a novie ninja
[2:54:07] <Flowlethal> Purple looking nice
[2:54:08] <SableS139a> Not a fan of this shade, but the fit is actually pretty sick.
[2:54:09] <%ggbhtg> Is this Movie 3 Nalt?
[2:54:10] <+LuckyRoooooo> so just to get this straight super is the modded version?
[2:54:20] <GeltonZ> Look, Naruto is just trying to blend in with traffic cones!
[2:54:21] <SableS139a> @LuckyRoooooo Yes
[2:54:22] <PhDream> Yes @LuckyRoooooo
[2:54:23] <nfsman34> @LuckyRoooooo Yes.
[2:54:29] <PhDream> You're watching them play Super GNT4.
[2:54:30] <@Menitta> Naruto Uzumaki Barrage
[2:54:32] <+LuckyRoooooo> gotcha doodGood
[2:54:40] <GeltonZ> Naruto is actually from The Village Hidden in the Traffic Cones!
[2:54:47] <SableS139a> @GeltonZ When cars are a rare to nonexistant thing in-universe?
[2:54:47] <CyrusVGZ> Those modern ninja who summon frogs, teleport and make thousands of clones of themselves Kappa
[2:54:50] <%Jetzord> @GeltonZ what is he trying to to be Majima?
[2:54:57] <%ggbhtg> Down and X was Neji's Kaiten, don't know if that's universal @WoolieVersus
[2:54:57] <biomegabear> Of the kids, sasuke was most dressed like a ninja should
[2:54:58] <HeroicVanguard> Down X for Uzumaki Barrage iirc
[2:55:08] <hadoking2> X is barrage
[2:55:08] <PhDream> Down X is Rasengan
[2:55:09] <GeltonZ> @Jetzord Better question, why aren't YOU trying to be Majima??
[2:55:12] <Mothman742> Shadow clones are busted af
[2:55:12] <zyaksha> Super adds alot of rebalancing and bug fixes to the game among other things @LuckyRoooooo
[2:55:18] <ARFARFclem> Back X is transform
[2:55:18] <hadoking2> Back X is transformation
[2:55:24] <GeltonZ> @SableS139a Yes.
[2:55:25] <+Jaysky> Wasn't Shino most ninja like?
[2:55:27] <WakeUpThrow> Shino is pretty ninja-ish
[2:55:36] <townzzzzz> the fight of one two guys
[2:55:41] <SableS139a> @GeltonZ majinoGameplay
[2:55:45] <%Jetzord> @GeltonZ Who says I'm not? I could be in that traffic cone next to you for all you know
[2:55:55] <biomegabear> Shino is another
[2:56:10] <GeltonZ> @Jetzord I don't have a-wait where DID all these traffic cones come from?!?
[2:56:20] <PhDream> Yeah, Naruto's install is him turning into Zero Tailed Kyuubi (or ZTK).
[2:56:23] <andre11dr> Kakashi and Zabuza are the only dude's that actually resemble ninja
[2:56:28] <crimsonsaens> Reggie has eaten every counter
[2:56:39] <+Thatnerdyrunner> never stop going in
[2:56:48] <+LuckyRoooooo> @zyaksha thats pretty cool. Im just happy to see ppl still playing these old games y'know

[2:57:07] <+Mendin> Danzo and Kisame did some of the most Ninja-y actions in the series
[2:57:12] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Naruto will never sit again

[3:01:00] <Mothman742> Choji got the grapples

[3:01:04] <biomegabear> I love these bloody roar stages
[3:01:14] <venomryu> @ggbhtg i know that eighting made this game but i never thought they would use old assats
[3:01:16] <%Jetzord> DID YOU?
[3:01:20] <deafmelone> Virtua Fighter music on a Bloody Roar stage in a Naruto Fighting Game
[3:01:30] <NotDamare> this is a modded in stage i think
[3:01:32] <%ggbhtg> @venomryu this is a mod
[3:01:34] <Super_Voltekka> I love how Choji thinks getting called fat is his N-word and only he is allowed to call himself that
[3:01:34] <+LuckyRoooooo> HELLO?
[3:01:35] <ozmon> Happy Birthday
[3:01:39] <Dante_Namikaze1> 8ting also did the Kamen Rider fighting games on Wii, PS2, and PSP

[3:01:41] <zyaksha> @NotDamare Bloody roar stage
[3:01:53] <biomegabear> kankuro can be a scary opponent
[3:02:00] <nfsman34> @venomryu Nah, the stages and animations are modded in. stuff like Asian Gate were modded into GNT4.
[3:02:13] <ozmon> Scary Chouji
[3:02:15] <%ggbhtg> dayyyyyum

[3:02:29] <TheGershon> Banned af
[3:02:33] <venomryu> @nfsman34 pk thanks i never played this game so i thought is was un modded
[3:02:34] <zyaksha> @WoolieVersus if you see a player named Lemo run and hide
[3:02:36] <HeroicVanguard> Bloody Roar stuff super easy to import because same engine
[3:02:42] <+SpicyNipples_> Karasu is joke character basically
[3:02:42] <+Mendin> Jirobu for another Big Stomp Man
[3:02:44] <Dante_Namikaze1> @flowlethal no because they did Super Climax Heroes after
[3:02:50] <+Xero_J> I mean I'd have totally believed they'd reference stages if I hadn't just been told otherwise
[3:02:50] <%ggbhtg> @zyaksha online sessions are done
[3:02:52] <+LuckyRoooooo> so a full on armor character
[3:02:54] <HeroicVanguard> Lemo a dang prodigy of GNT
[3:02:55] <WakeUpThrow> So he's mecha gief?
[3:03:04] <ozmon> lol they actually have Kankuro there
[3:03:06] <nailwind> intimidating hovering

[3:03:50] <zyaksha> no they need to play sakon
[3:03:51] <%Jetzord> These creaky noises are just the cherry on top
[3:03:52] <WakeUpThrow> This character is way too fast to have permanent hyper armor
[3:03:58] <%CaptainPileDriver> SUPER HIM
[3:04:10] <+Mendin> Launchers and throws are his bane
[3:04:14] <Flowlethal> Karasu be carrying
[3:04:23] <%ggbhtg> Reggie lacking critical information

[3:04:43] <2dere> @thatnerdyrunner hahahah
[3:04:50] <%ggbhtg> critical information acquired
[3:05:09] <deafmelone> We need Karasu vs Akamaru
[3:05:10] <zyaksha> reggie should be spamming super on orochi more
[3:05:14] <%ggbhtg> the sound effects of the strings LUL
[3:05:17] <+Mendin> Karasu used to be banned alongside Akamaru and then people realized he's kinda ass, just ass with hyper armor
[3:05:20] <zyaksha> orochi super annoying asf
[3:05:40] <%gatorafan> Leave Jiren to me! says the puppet, somehow despite not being able to talk.
[3:05:43] <+LuckyRoooooo> kankuro just laughing in the corner
[3:05:48] <+paladinstarbuster> Tayuya Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm

[3:08:57] <+Xero_J> I like that whoever modded this stage went the extra mile to add the stained glass
[3:09:01] <majinken> @arek_1 exactly 😉
[3:09:15] <+Jaysky> I wish you could knock them below the stage
[3:09:23] <Flowlethal> 8ing worked on bloody roar too
[3:09:24] <%aogman> @Xero_J what do you mean that's clearly the traditional konoha AQUARIUM sponsored by hashirama and madara

[3:10:47] <zyaksha> oh looks its Ukon

[3:10:53] <zyaksha> not sakon cause sakon is useless

[3:11:03] <+Jaysky> How didn't he die
[3:11:12] <gyrobasel> "srugeryP
[3:11:13] <biomegabear> Pre-shippuden was still fun to watch
[3:11:14] <%ggbhtg> @Jaysky Fan backlash
[3:11:22] <TheMofologist> Chunin exam has the best track
[3:11:23] <+Jaysky> He had FANS?
[3:11:32] <%ggbhtg> Neji and Chouji were HELLA cooked
[3:11:32] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1348891911097110529?s=19
[3:11:33] <Flowlethal> Neji is like only one who died in war
[3:11:37] <andre11dr> Naruto has big problem with not letting people just die ,especially Guy
[3:11:37] <+Xero_J> Everyone has fans
[3:11:44] <%AlteisenReiseZ> PLAY MASK OFF
[3:11:52] <+Jaysky> Enough fans to counteract the writing tho?
[3:11:54] <nailwind> @andre11dr still makes me angry
[3:11:54] <+LuckyRoooooo> @Flowlethal ino and shikamaru dads too
[3:11:55] <TheGershon> I feel like it was probably an editor's decision
[3:11:57] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> Sitting here being an anko fan wondering if she'll be picked lmao
[3:11:59] <+SpicyNipples_> you have to change forms with sakon
[3:12:05] <+FuqBoiSlim> I remember child me crying real life tears at Choji's """death""" scene and getting tight asf when he was alright in the end
[3:12:05] <Arek_1> That aquarium is where 3-tailed Rin spent her days. LUL
[3:12:09] <+askalta> flute noises
[3:12:09] <+SpicyNipples_> his other form way better
[3:12:13] <%aogman> LMFAO
[3:12:14] <%Kriss1827> @Meta_Yoroitoshi im pretty sure they already did
[3:12:15] <MutedMimic> Ookay LUL
[3:12:15] <zyaksha> one of the only characters to use the Z button
[3:12:21] <%ggbhtg> Neji and Chouji were HELLA cooked, then either fan backlash or the story editors said "nah son"
[3:12:23] <+glassesaregod> LMAO
[3:12:24] <%WutangchickeN> WHAT WHY
[3:12:25] <+LuckyRoooooo> ????
[3:12:34] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> Dang I must've dozed off for a sec then lol...
[3:12:35] <+Jaysky> Remember when Konoha got leveled by Pein and then everyone got brought back cause od deus ex no jutsu?
[3:12:41] <+Jaysky> *of
[3:12:43] <%WutangchickeN> wutang6BEES wutang6BEES wutang6BEES
[3:12:46] <CyrusVGZ> Editors always stick their hands into everything. For better or worse.
[3:12:46] <roarofdamnation> Reggie whiffing his supers is as classic as Reggie dying with a full bar of butter.
[3:12:50] <Ragna_Ru> how many naruto characters use techniques that "kill" them only to get back up like 10 minutes later? It's gotta be at least 15 right?
[3:12:57] <JDebss> @Jaysky I member
[3:13:04] <nailwind> @Jaysky lemme press Ctrl+Z on this genocide rq
[3:13:05] <majinken> @jaysky 🤣

[3:13:17] <+MikeNmurdoc> LUL
[3:13:22] <+Jaysky> Pein was the COOLEST genocider
[3:13:23] <sasobruh> swaggy game
[3:13:24] <ozmon> The flute coverage is dope
[3:13:28] <%gatorafan> Makes one think about all the freaky stuff Orochimaru did to not die and how pointless it feels considering how hard is to actually perish on this world Kappa
[3:13:33] <+glassesaregod> @WoolieVersus Throw into Down+X is my jam for Tayuya
[3:14:01] <majinken> @nailwind 😂
[3:14:02] <Ragna_Ru> in a show about assassins you gotta be real ass to actually get killed
[3:14:03] <+Jaysky> I did @WoolieVersus and that's unfortunate. It's the Konoha Gates stage but at night with cherry blossom trees.
[3:14:04] <andre11dr> Like Naruto really makes me appreciate Arakis decision to just pop main characters like a gun shot
[3:14:06] <%AlteisenReiseZ> WEB SWING
[3:14:11] <Mothman742> Chat did that boruto villain end up being jiraya or nah? Cause when i heard he could be jiraya i git heated

[3:14:32] <+Thatnerdyrunner> @Mothman742 its complicated
[3:14:44] <majinken> @ultimatessjzerox yup
[3:14:49] <+YungFBI> @Mothman742 the answer is a spoiler
[3:14:57] <%gatorafan> @mothman742, I don't read that, I feel like I'm a happier person because of it woolieSMUG
[3:15:03] <+Thatnerdyrunner> yeah Cant say

[3:15:07] <Viktor616> That was cheeky
[3:15:08] <zyaksha> SPIDERMAN
[3:15:12] <+LuckyRoooooo> The manga actually isnt that bad
[3:15:14] <Mothman742> People still care abkut boruto spoilers!?!?
[3:15:18] <%CaptainPileDriver> kidomaru has a web command grab
[3:15:25] <+YungFBI> @ggbhtg this is the super naruto one?
[3:15:26] <townzzzzz> just a big body
[3:15:28] <UltimateSSJZeroX> Web bomb
[3:15:29] <+Xero_J> It's not that old
[3:15:31] <TheGershon> Boruto manga is p good
[3:15:31] <+Thatnerdyrunner> it's been good the last few arcs tbh
[3:15:35] <KgKid51> SourPls
[3:15:38] <%ggbhtg> yeh @YungFBI
[3:15:42] <+Thatnerdyrunner> even the anime has stepped it up
[3:15:42] <+LuckyRoooooo> just easier for ppl to hate on it
[3:15:43] <+Jaysky> The only one of these cursed fellas I remember is flute girl
[3:15:44] <CyrusVGZ> I actually started watching Boruto again because it caught up to the part of the manga I want to see animated. Boruto is pretty good now.
[3:15:48] <Arek_1> Boruto readers, can you TELL that Kishimoto is back to writing it? LUL
[3:15:57] <+FuqBoiSlim> you're telling me this is the smash melee of naruto fighters??
[3:16:01] <357Sneak> Heeey!
[3:16:01] <+Thatnerdyrunner> @Arek_1 It's opnly been one chapter so not yet
[3:16:01] <+SpicyNipples_> boruto is dodo
[3:16:05] <+YungFBI> not yet but i know its coming @Arek_1
[3:16:05] <357Sneak> How's it goin?
[3:16:07] <andre11dr> @thegershon Just wait till Kishimoto gets back in
[3:16:17] <Sol_Install> kishimoto already back in
[3:16:19] <TheGershon> We'll just have to see
[3:16:21] <%gatorafan> Kishimoto: BACK IN!
[3:16:21] <+Jaysky> Will we get moon people?
[3:16:24] <%ggbhtg> no, Bloody Roar devs made it @FuqBoiSlim
[3:16:24] <Sol_Install> and so far he has shown his writing yet
[3:16:29] <+Thatnerdyrunner> @andre11dr Man Sarada about to get wife nerfed so hard
[3:16:31] <Sol_Install> it edging there but idk
[3:16:35] <+LuckyRoooooo> didnt he draw the recent cover art for boruto?
[3:16:45] <+SpicyNipples_> Ive been hearing just wait till it gets good for like 2 years now, still waiting lmao
[3:16:46] <TheGershon> I hope he redesigns Sarada again
[3:16:49] <+SixMillionDollarGamer> Kishimoto will save Boruto just like he did Shippuden Kappa
[3:16:50] <Arek_1> Kishimoto: "Itachi will come back to solo everyone!" LUL
[3:16:50] <+Thatnerdyrunner> PLEASE
[3:16:57] <+Thatnerdyrunner> her manga outfit is trash
[3:17:01] <+LuckyRoooooo> @SixMillionDollarGamer doodBait
[3:17:03] <CyrusVGZ> Shoutouts to Viz for letting me read manga for free legally.
[3:17:06] <357Sneak> SourPls
[3:17:07] <+Jaysky> Does Sarada still wear glasses? Do they magically stay on?
[3:17:12] <Jrocy247> >Sound Ninja, >Uses a Bunch of Rocks
[3:17:17] <nfsman34> WELCOME TO MONTANA!
[3:17:18] <+Thatnerdyrunner> @Jaysky yup
[3:17:20] <ARFARFclem> Montana.
[3:17:25] <hadoking2> MONTANA
[3:17:26] <+FuqBoiSlim> she sticks them on her face with chakra notsquishY
[3:17:35] <thatdudeindahoodie> so many openings to do supers I'm cringing
[3:17:38] <%CaptainPileDriver> that fight was amazing
[3:17:49] <+Jaysky> I liked that it AoT they had a logical way for characters to wear glasses whilist flying around but in Naruto they just keep em normal glasses
[3:17:59] <Arek_1> @Jaysky They stay on in the same way as Shino and Karin's do.
[3:18:11] <%ggbhtg> @thatdudeindahoodie should been here when they fought people online, I guess
[3:18:23] <+TueDuffCity> What is this song?
[3:18:25] <%LotS__> *teleports behind you*
[3:18:26] <+Jaysky> @Arek_1 Ah yes, chakra magnetic glasses Kappa
[3:18:28] <+LuckyRoooooo> I feel like kishi limited himself on people's opinions or backlash too much
[3:18:28] <andre11dr> Wat is the treat in Boruto? Like isn't Naruto a god that can solve everything?
[3:18:29] <+TueDuffCity> For the aquarium

[3:23:11] <sasobruh> NARUTO GNT > STORM
[3:23:15] <+Mendin> Now Reggie gonna grab his friend who plays this and drag him to the shadow realm for blood duels
[3:23:16] <Arek_1> The worst part is that could've been conceptually avoided as they took some creative liberties in making that super. LUL
[3:23:17] <RyuuAoi> Omg why isn't Woolie on the left doe?!
[3:23:17] <%ggbhtg> @WoolieVersus Narutimate ONLY won because Storm 1 came out at a good time
[3:23:19] <HeroicVanguard> It's been a great stream, love seeing the support for Super :D
[3:23:21] <CyrusVGZ> Glad I chose to read the Woolie Versus manga this time.
[3:23:22] <GeltonZ> It's also because Eighting never made the jump to HD until MvC3.
[3:23:22] <UltimateSSJZeroX> Is Eighting still around?
[3:23:27] <TheGershon> There's some pretty cool team supers in the base game
[3:23:28] <+Jaysky> I get why Storm got it though
[3:23:32] <%gatorafan> That last super didn't look regular to me Kappa
[3:23:33] <Sol_Install> Eighting + cyberconnect + new nartuo fighter area like this?
[3:23:35] <Sol_Install> NUT
[3:23:38] <GeltonZ> @UltimateSSJZeroX Yup! They're making DNF Duel with ArcSys!
[3:23:42] <+Mendin> @UltimateSSJZeroX They're making the new Dungeon Fighter fighting game
[3:23:54] <%ggbhtg> We only got Taisen 1 and 2
[3:23:56] <UltimateSSJZeroX> Ah ok, sweet
[3:23:56] <%ggbhtg> and that's sad
[3:23:57] <+Thatnerdyrunner> thanks guys
[3:23:59] <CyrusVGZ> An Eighting and CC2 collab is too powerful.
[3:24:08] <%CaptainPileDriver> so gitfg is now Saturdays?
[3:24:11] <+SpicyNipples_> Yeo if anyone wants to join the discord for sgnt4 feel free to dm me
[3:24:12] <+MakishimaWolf> @WoolieVersus you got a slight mic buzz on your end that may need fixing next stream
