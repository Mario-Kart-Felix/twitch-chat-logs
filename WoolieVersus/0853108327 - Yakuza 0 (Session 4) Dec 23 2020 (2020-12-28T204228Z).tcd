[0:03:30] <Halospaz117> Cheer500 Sup Woolz and V, been really enjoying the playthrough so far, if it's alright thought I'd drop some minor gameplay tips, if not it's cool, enjoy the game either way. 1. If you're ever in a situation where you wanna hit the Y button without doing a heat move, holding left trigger negates the usage of any heat moves. 2. I forget if this was already explained, but repeated usage of the same heat move on the same enemy has diminished returns in terms of damage, so variety is encouraged.

[0:04:37] <+solzan2000> theres defo a game game in there
[0:04:39] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @blastyoboots So i read about that. Pat GROSSLY overexaggerated that.
[0:04:39] <%aram909> just tuned in, what game are they talking about?

[0:04:41] <+solzan2000> good*
[0:04:42] <@Menitta> I got one of the endings last night and FUUUUCK that game is so interesting
[0:04:44] <+eyezehuhh> but what of the cyber dong?
[0:04:47] <%aram909> oh cyberpunk2077
[0:04:49] <drhivesphd> maybe no mans sky it
[0:04:57] <%bPlusPlus> Hiding under a cocoon of bugs
[0:04:58] <+wvan_13> @eyezehuhh Incredibly disappointing. No cyber-dong options.
[0:05:02] <@Menitta> The art style is 1:1 Dredd 2012
[0:05:03] <andre11dr> But the game looks bad tho
[0:05:14] <%emperordread> That Half-Life era vending machines tech :P
[0:05:17] <%ggbhtg> deploy the C.C. Lemon
[0:05:21] <%eyezehuhh> @wvan_13 all that hype for not. just like real dongs
[0:05:22] <drhivesphd> cyberpunk might be good in a few years but it really needed work
[0:05:24] <+DrPoxx> Vending machines essentially print money
[0:05:25] <%r0chelimit> r0chelimit subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months, currently on a 8 month streak! Woolie since you’ve played some shooters, do you think you could describe them in fighting game terms now? Like COD as SF because of its dependence on the essential skills, while Doom Eternal is more like marvel with its speed and multiple systems
[0:05:37] <brunoberserk> EUROJANK
[0:05:37] <Jp_DrZaius> Nicola! taste the love
[0:05:37] <+JustToWatch> geologists theorize that under several strata of bugs, there is in fact a decent game there
[0:05:39] <sonofthedeepsouth> TRU
[0:05:39] <moonmintparadise> Cyberpunk 2077 is the kind of game that you love but its such a technical mess that you literally need a tolerance for dealing with the games problems or else you will quickly stop playing it. Your Bias for the Genre and Aesthetic needs to be strong.
[0:05:40] <+jiggy_snipe> it's got that Eurojank
[0:05:42] <+the22cstomp> it did not start development before witcher 3

[0:05:55] <$BallerSwagBro9k> W3 WAS A MESS AT LAUNCH
[0:05:56] <+solzan2000> yea witcher 3 was dodgy asf
[0:05:56] <%ggbhtg> Also, Witcher been had jank

[0:06:04] <@akuda_bar> that wasn't a serious bug lol, that was just inertia
[0:06:04] <Monkeyweed21> it wasn't this bad
[0:06:05] <Halospaz117> I was that one asshole who never had a problem with Geralt's movement
[0:06:06] <sonofthedeepsouth> A MES
[0:06:07] <+wvan_13> I bought Witcher 1 back on PC on discs at Walmart
[0:06:08] <%wibbwobbler> i walked away from witcher 3 thinking it's o.k.
[0:06:10] <%ggbhtg> "But that was then and this is NOWWWWW"
[0:06:13] <%aram909> it started development before witcher 3 but development restarted several times. the latest iteration of cyberpunk2077 had its preproduction start in 2016, so actual development time was roughly 2-3 years
[0:06:14] <+Stupid121v2> Witcher 1 is still jank to this DAY
[0:06:16] <%eyezehuhh> I was born in 1996

[0:06:26] <+JustToWatch> launch Witcher 3 was rough but this is another level of jank
[0:06:28] <+Koover> I like witcher 1 combat
[0:06:28] <@Solidus_113> FF7R
[0:06:28] <CappuccinoGuil> I don't know man, Witcher didn't lie about its performance and didn't try to stab your eyeballs with lights

[0:06:31] <%Spydurman> never heard of any of that
[0:06:31] <$Superdandy96> woolieSHOOK_SA
[0:06:33] <%MajkirM> Witcher 1 was rough.
[0:06:35] <andre11dr> Well Witcher at least let me play it ,but Cyberpunk crushes so much
[0:06:36] <@Menitta> The development effectively started in 2016
[0:06:36] <%Ancopro> it got no man sky levels of build up
[0:06:37] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> you reward Eurojank, YOU GET EUROJANK
[0:06:39] <akman14> Eurojank is a racist term
[0:06:42] <mortificent> that aesthetic of cyberpunk is not really for me, I prefer stuff like Stand Alone Complex, a bit more clean
[0:06:46] <%alwaysneedcaffiene> so behthesda rules?
[0:06:51] <@akuda_bar> didn't woolie invent that term
[0:06:53] <%ggbhtg> I'd consider "Eurojank" a term only "we" know, sadly
[0:06:55] <%RyTYoung> The same year as my brother PogChamp
[0:06:58] <Jp_DrZaius> same year
[0:07:00] <Kohei_kyouji> im guessing it isnt like eurobeat >_>
[0:07:04] <%aram909> cyberpunk2077 is the world's first AAA Eurojank
[0:07:05] <%Spydurman> never was aware of a single Witcher release until far after they came out
[0:07:05] <%blaccbird914> 91 here too
[0:07:05] <+Billyfig1> its bethesdajank now
[0:07:05] <$BallerSwagBro9k> 2 years older than me
[0:07:06] <%Chatterbox1991> the original Cyberpunk trailer predates the first episode of the podcast in 2013 @woolieversus
[0:07:07] <%Aldesso> fallout 4 was worse at launch then Cyberpunk
[0:07:09] <%ggbhtg> I'd consider "Eurojank" a term and a concept only "we" know, sadly
[0:07:09] <+Liquid_Dio> @akman14 what ISN'T these days?
[0:07:14] <+spinalwizard> Witcher 2 needed a new beginning added because no one could figure out how to play it
[0:07:14] <drhivesphd> what's with the suit? PogChamp
[0:07:16] <+ZoltanBMagnus> i was born in 1998. I knew what eurojank is
[0:07:18] <$Superdandy96> I hope they’re able to fix it like how No Man Sky was able to fix itself
[0:07:18] <HeinzBBQ> Witcher 3 was jankier than Cyberpunk, Cyberpunk just had more hype so more people noticed it.
[0:07:21] <+Koover> Expectation buildup is rough
[0:07:24] <+jiggy_snipe> yea but when you have restart, idk
[0:07:25] <@Menitta> The guns feel really good
[0:07:33] <%MajkirM> Holy shit, V, you're younger than me xD
[0:07:35] <@Menitta> ooooh yeah thats good

[0:07:44] <chainsaw105> if only there was... a wall run
[0:07:47] <%eyezehuhh> I've only heard the term from y'all so bless
[0:07:47] <@Solidus_113> Double jump and gorilla hands
[0:07:50] <+Koover> ayy same but with baseball bats
[0:07:51] <masterfire23> become genji
[0:07:53] <%Spydurman> also you're cool playing a game by such a shitty company?

[0:08:10] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Most bugs are graphical
[0:08:11] <%X2Eliah> But what's the point of dodging and weaving if the goons just spawn in behind you all the time

[0:09:36] <chainsaw105> have you punched a man in a wheelchair and caused him to stand up and run
[0:09:47] <%ggbhtg> Was the issue actually fixed, or was that a woolieONEGUY ?
[0:09:49] <+TheCrispyBoi> new vegas was worse at lanch
[0:09:51] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> all these problems sounds like a thing that would be a problem on PS2
[0:09:51] <+BusterRepukken> you wouldnt get a save file that large unless you use the duplication glitch anyway
[0:09:54] <%Th3SmartAlec> @chainsaw105 Oi Josuke
[0:09:55] <+b_aleph> When's the Futa Fix Dick Dine and Dash LP?

[0:10:08] <+blastyoboots> @BallerSwagBro9k when was it patched? I'm trying to look online to find it but can't
[0:10:11] <moonmintparadise> Apparently the save issue is caused by duping items because it tracks iconic weapons for the weapon rack and achievements, so they literally have a individual assignment. Same with other items but much less.
[0:10:16] <+spinalwizard> Oh boy, don't buy it
[0:10:16] <@Menitta> The story is veeeeery GITS
[0:10:24] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> i love those and i still wont recommend this game lmao
[0:10:26] <WhatzePh> @DiscoMatador They will really need a comeback akin to FFXIV and No Man's Sky
[0:10:27] <%alwaysneedcaffiene> hours since last clock reset?
[0:10:28] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Blade in the shell
[0:10:29] <+BusterRepukken> if you dont dupe items, you're fine
[0:10:29] <andre11dr> I will say, launch New Vegas was also really busted and that turned around

[0:11:14] <%ggbhtg> Big runs, Big fun
[0:11:14] <+InternetRascal> Shadow Run is garbage
[0:11:15] <+BusterRepukken> Reminder Deus Ex 3 died for Avengers
[0:11:16] <CappuccinoGuil> So CP77 doesn't do anything interesting that other games already do, huh?
[0:11:18] <+aragaojunior> deus ex Kreygasm

[0:11:37] <+OUTheTeam> man I dropped off ghostrunner cause I kept glitching and not grabbing ledges
[0:11:37] <%r0chelimit> That’s a good ass game
[0:11:43] <+BusterRepukken> I say 3 cause its the third adam jensen game

[0:11:47] <%X2Eliah> ... Dude, no
[0:11:47] <CappuccinoGuil> DUDE, Woolie should play New Vegas
[0:11:47] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Stream cancelled due to Corona.

[0:11:49] <sonofthedeepsouth> THATS MORROWIND
[0:11:50] <+spinalwizard> they just wake up
[0:11:51] <Ninjalettuce> Stalker
[0:11:54] <mortificent> New Vegas is a must
[0:11:56] <%ggbhtg> Because Bethedsa will NEVER fix anything, so you make your own fun LUL
[0:11:59] <Halospaz117> Was about to say Stalker
[0:11:59] <@Solidus_113> STALKER fucking rules
[0:11:59] <+b_aleph> There's also Anachronox, it's cool
[0:12:07] <gustavozxd> it's gonna suck
[0:12:08] <Halospaz117> God STALKER is so fucking broken, I LOVE IT

[0:12:11] <Ninjalettuce> Stalker 2 Pog
[0:12:12] <+Stupid121v2> STALKER and New Vegas GOAT
[0:12:14] <sonofthedeepsouth> With the death of this character the thread of fate has been severed
[0:12:16] <%ggbhtg> BUT DID YOU KNOW V, it has to be ME that tells you! MEEEEE
[0:12:17] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Halospaz117
[0:12:25] <+BusterRepukken> at least CDPR got refunds going, Bethesda told people to go F themselves over 76.
[0:12:27] <Halospaz117> They did actually manage to mod mobile KOTOR 2
[0:12:29] <rockethed1> STALKER
[0:12:29] <chainsaw105> oops my phone exploded playing Kotor 2!
[0:12:32] <Sapphire_Breeze> @WoolieVersus I think it has mod support to some degree
[0:12:32] <@Menitta> I played New Vegas on 360 and still loved it
[0:12:32] <%Javaa01> Most of the best written RPGs are fuckbusted games
[0:12:33] <+BusterRepukken> not a high bar but still
[0:12:34] <%emperordread> I like my games how I like my women, broken
[0:12:36] <CyborgAV> It's called "EuroJank" for a reason

[0:13:27] <+steelmorrigan> I managed to squirm past the Bugs myself V, but I get it :) My Cyberpunk fix is midly sated.
[0:13:33] <%solracc25> yes go treat yourself to mando
[0:13:35] <lucky_icarus> Yeah, I love Dragon Age but damn does it get buggy. Especially Origins. You have to uninstall a DLC or else it fucks up some shit in another.
[0:13:36] <@Squdnate> LuvPeekR

[0:15:02] <%X2Eliah> Speaking of Soul-Crushing Social Media, have you heard to good word of LinkedIn?
[0:15:11] <%ggbhtg> If there was a online equivalent to How To Win Friends and Influence for the internet age...
[0:15:14] <%ggbhtg> that'd be nice
[0:15:20] <%eyezehuhh> LinkedIn having stories is hilarious

[0:16:05] <+murphypurpdrank_> I hope everything is going okay with covid in mtl, sending prayers from toronto (even though you guys hate us)
[0:16:07] <+krispen_wa> Canada is just North United States
[0:16:09] <sonofthedeepsouth> Maple leaf on your chest proud to be a canadian
[0:16:26] <%ggbhtg> I've heard that comparison before
[0:16:27] <gustavozxd> tbf if you're anywhere outside Canada or US, it's hard to tell the differences most of the time
[0:16:27] <OblivionSword1> people can't differentiate between american and canadian
[0:16:27] <%eyezehuhh> Reverse Isekai???
[0:16:30] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Fair

[0:17:19] <JetpackMcQuack> All games are fighting games
[0:17:21] <SuperBloodWolfMoon> i love when Woolie does that, tho
[0:17:23] <+McSoliace> people like shitting on things they don't understand
[0:17:23] <%dreadedcthulhu> woolie i have started using more and more fighting game terminology in casual conversation you've infected me
[0:17:28] <+jiggy_snipe> he used OTG and meaty in Demons's Souls yesterday LUL
[0:17:32] <%LastHazzerd> I like fighting game terms.....

[0:18:05] <@akuda_bar> killer queen arcade... killer queen black....
[0:18:07] <+jiggy_snipe> I'd watch a video series of Woolie describing different games in fighting game terms
[0:18:10] <%ggbhtg> Actually, the real problem is that a lot of people just DON'T understand metaphors
[0:18:11] <sonofthedeepsouth> Arma 3 and COD yes they are the same game Kappa
[0:18:11] <MyNameIsRasus> I miss PS2 Need For Speed games
[0:18:12] <JetpackMcQuack> Metaphors are versatile
[0:18:12] <%linSP> cars turbo is a super meter
[0:18:16] <+Koover> we must acquire speed
[0:18:18] <+b_aleph> Wipeout is too hard
[0:18:23] <%X2Eliah> So the thing about referencing everything to fighting games is, only a narrow audience will get / enjoy that.
[0:18:31] <chainsaw105> is yakuza the Dark Souls of fighting games?
[0:18:37] <%eyezehuhh> i fookin luv kars

[0:30:31] <chainsaw105> flash enough CP and eventually the 1% will appear
[0:30:31] <kingra> Invest the CP for rich people

[0:30:38] <%Lion_kun> It's right next to the Mahjong place
[0:30:42] <+MintMuffinGamer> Did Woolie find pocket circuit min-game/sidestorie let?
[0:30:45] <DevinMayCry> Mahjong or riot
[0:30:45] <@Menitta> Weird how it took so long to add custom waypoints to the map in this series

[0:31:24] <FuumetsuKuroi> The taxi man got cp for days
[0:31:29] <DevinMayCry> Yeah laying it on too thick now maybe

[0:31:55] <MyNameIsRasus> Essence of Orbital Laser is such a problem solver

[0:32:22] <8bitdana> @Menitta oh would make sense, ty!
[0:32:42] <Timurine> Ok what are those circle effects when there is an attack?
[0:32:45] <OblivionSword1> might want to heal in a restaurant
[0:32:46] <+Koover> are plates the prizes you get from pachinko places that you trade into the pawn shops net door?
[0:32:50] <+God_Of_Oreos> These streams made me finally play Yakuza 0. Beat it over the weekend and I loved it hope Woolie does too jermaFireman
[0:32:52] <@Solidus_113> MONEY
[0:33:07] <MyNameIsRasus> GOTTA GET THE CASH
[0:33:08] <+ArmoredDeath> dekillMonke
[0:33:08] <DevinMayCry> @Koover I never thought of that... Makes sense
[0:33:10] <%alwaysneedcaffiene> pay or tip gratuitously?
[0:33:11] <tsunderecactus0> I believe custom waypoints were in all Dragon Engine games @menitta
[0:33:18] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[0:33:23] <DevinMayCry> Wakarimasen
[0:33:26] <MyNameIsRasus> SUMIMASORRY
[0:33:33] <+faintsmile> time to eat money
[0:33:34] <%TheAntitype> TheAntitype subscribed at Tier 1.
[0:33:36] <+krispen_wa> I started Yakuza 0 a few weeks ago but i haven't gotten anywhere because i keep spending my time farming Shakedown
[0:33:49] <DevinMayCry> Youll hit a wall eventuaslly
[0:33:49] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL Not this series
[0:33:50] <@Menitta> @tsunderecactus0 I thought so. Havent played 6 and K2 in a bit so didnt wanna sound so sure
[0:33:53] <BlackDae> looking forward to watching this after work! I'm currently playing through yakuza 0 with you for my first time
[0:33:53] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> what if u need it later! Kappa
[0:34:04] <tsunderecactus0> It was a nice feature
[0:34:07] <MyNameIsRasus> These games healed my item hoarding
[0:34:09] <8bitdana> @krispen_wa money becomes easier to obtain as you progress so dont worry!
[0:34:13] <sonofthedeepsouth> PEGGED WOOLIE
[0:34:26] <Puhff> are there food buffs like in 7?
[0:34:32] <dante_suoh> @krispen_wa You have the shakedown CP and the elemental shotguns?
[0:34:37] <@akuda_bar> honestly items are the most not well implemented thing in the yakuza series
[0:34:38] <notsoy> THAT MOVE IS SUPER GOOD
[0:34:40] <@akuda_bar> @Menitta do you disagree
[0:34:41] <brunoberserk> dark souls ruined woolie
[0:34:41] <sonofthedeepsouth> what about the secret boss
[0:34:42] <$BallerSwagBro9k> NO PAT NOW
[0:34:43] <%ChoculaUltra> I'm telling you man, I'll need these Full Elixirs one day! One day!
[0:34:43] <+ConLin_Arts_> item menu full with Staminan Royale is the true endgame
[0:34:51] <+jiggy_snipe> always horde your items
[0:34:55] <@Solidus_113> QUICKSTEP
[0:34:57] <domvito1234> yo wollie, what was the last main story beat you did?
[0:35:00] <%sneekypotato> and then mr shakedown shows up when you have no health
[0:35:03] <%Spydurman> Wall Crush heat move is really generous FYI
[0:35:10] <%Spydurman> in terms of where you have to be
[0:35:11] <+krispen_wa> @dante_suoh no shotgun, but i have the shakedown cp thing
[0:35:12] <WG101> @domvito1234 oda showed up and slapped with money
[0:35:20] <%Th3SmartAlec> You can normally get as many health items you need by 25% through any Yakuza game
[0:35:22] <@Menitta> @akuda_bar In 0, they are especially not well implemented because you're flooded with cash and can just buy 20 Staminan Royales for basically free
[0:35:23] <%HollowedIdjit> Wall Crush Heat Move is the best
[0:35:23] <user_naim> That leads to greater satisfaction when you replay the game, and know exactly when to spend resources
[0:35:30] <@akuda_bar> true
[0:35:33] <Pookiedaexzile> You must understand Woolie, Eating food is necessary to live, Living is necessary to punch, Punch is necessary to Kiryu
[0:35:38] <DevinMayCry> Yeah items are a crutch of the series that is so ingrained its a crucial part of the final battle of the movie, and its a thing thats not really that great
[0:35:40] <domvito1234> @WG101 ah, thanks
[0:36:08] <MyNameIsRasus> IRASHAIMASE
[0:36:09] <$Superdandy96> Quick change was my favorite item
[0:36:11] <@akuda_bar> it's the beat em up equivalent of putting your iron boots on in the water temple
[0:36:12] <%Th3SmartAlec> That was WEAK
[0:36:17] <@Menitta> They're better in some of the other games and much better in 7
[0:36:18] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> @WoolieVersus V remember to explain alcohol to woolz.
[0:36:25] <MyNameIsRasus> That was some weak Irashai shit
[0:36:29] <8bitdana> baja blast
[0:36:30] <+el_hearto> I mean to be honest items aren't that important, if you die in a boss you restart at the beginning of a fight so it's more fun in my opinion to just try and beat the boss without using an item
[0:36:33] <sonofthedeepsouth> AWESOME
[0:36:41] <sonofthedeepsouth> cheap beers
[0:36:42] <+RenoDeGeneric> yaSHAAA
[0:36:46] <+Koover> suddenly hungry
[0:36:51] <Iwashi94> $4 beer isn't expensive?!
[0:36:59] <%X2Eliah> YAKISOBA PAN
[0:37:00] <$Superdandy96> Oh god food
[0:37:01] <@Menitta> But it still has an issue of items only being necessary during fights and such because in any given moment, you're still like 2 steps away from a restaraunt
[0:37:06] <@Menitta> restaurant*
[0:37:09] <ARDM112> Well, why would the prices update if the currency is deflating?
[0:37:11] <%eyezehuhh> Good cheap beer
[0:37:19] <tsunderecactus0> Items are just weird in these games
[0:37:19] <brachydios777> Botemless stomach is so useful
[0:37:20] <+el_hearto> that's true, I didn't think about that aspect
[0:37:25] <GarbageNirvana> Drink a Yamazaki and you can start doing that thing with your arm he does
[0:37:28] <sonofthedeepsouth> true
[0:37:31] <mister___doctor> AW YE
[0:37:31] <+Koover> waddya mean booze aint food
[0:37:32] <Ner234> Not wrong
[0:37:33] <@Solidus_113> hunger go down
[0:37:39] <X2Eliah> Whiskey = Health
[0:37:40] <DevinMayCry> Ninja Gaiden 2 had an interesting mechanic of your health regenerating between fights but your max health depleted as you took major damage and you had to use items to replenish it. Fatal damage in Judgment at least is similar but is FAR FAR more punishing and takes a lot of money to remove in comparison
[0:37:45] <$BallerSwagBro9k> In 0 yes
[0:37:46] <ARDM112> Woolie hasn't hit Quadruple Booze yet
[0:37:47] <brachydios777> I need to finish this game
[0:37:48] <8bitdana> i loved the drunk heatmove in judgment LUL
[0:37:50] <@akuda_bar> $4 is cheap in canada, $2 beer is cheap in like north carolina
[0:37:55] <Pookiedaexzile> Whiskey is a Health potion in real life
[0:37:57] <brunoberserk> FIGHT DRUNK
[0:37:59] <+krispen_wa> so what's the point of having so many restaurants with so many food choices besides immersion?
[0:38:00] <Darren716> Nah they think you're an asshole
[0:38:04] <%emperordread> You're drunk? I'll KILL you
[0:38:06] <NotHereToStream> you're drunk? I'LL KILL YOU
[0:38:07] <mister___doctor> My lungs hurt. Bring me some whiskey
[0:38:07] <%nevermorecake> At least it's not like Kiwami 2 where you go REALLY off the fucking rails when you drink
[0:38:07] <CappuccinoGuil> Probably because they think they can take on a drunk
[0:38:08] <@Menitta> I got my dad a bottle of Canadian whiskey for christmas
[0:38:10] <WG101> @krispen_wa compo
[0:38:10] <+faintsmile> they can smell the drunk on you
[0:38:11] <%alwaysneedcaffiene> drunks draw aggro
[0:38:13] <%eyezehuhh> Health meter, more like whiskey meter. Amiright? psaDab
[0:38:19] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> @WoolieVersus Being drunk should also increases the rate you build up Heat.
[0:38:20] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:38:20] <Halospaz117> Earlier Yakuza games had pre-fight dialogue, and yeah they just think you're a drunk asshole
[0:38:22] <%X2Eliah> Empty Lot
[0:38:24] <MyNameIsRasus> Brawler theme is so good
[0:38:27] <FuumetsuKuroi> What's wrong with being a pervert?!
[0:38:31] <DevinMayCry> You should be able to go into negative health when super drunk but heat moves are done randomly without your control
[0:38:33] <Nekros4442> Need more Beast Heat moves
[0:38:35] <%eyezehuhh> God I love these themes
[0:38:46] <%Th3SmartAlec> ded
[0:38:51] <%HollowedIdjit> rip
[0:38:53] <%eyezehuhh> Nice
[0:38:56] <%alwaysneedcaffiene> drunks are real world tanks.
[0:38:57] <%tank7013> @krispen_wa No that's pretty much the point. Could also be product placement I guess considering the shitload of it in these games
[0:38:58] <tsunderecactus0> You know what this game really needs though
[0:39:00] <sonofthedeepsouth> just
[0:39:02] <tsunderecactus0> A combo list
[0:39:08] <+faintsmile> for reasons
[0:39:08] <CappuccinoGuil> Always save
[0:39:09] <DevinMayCry> It has one doesnt it
[0:39:10] <%X2Eliah> Woolie just think of it as invisible DMCV style meter
[0:39:11] <Nekros4442> it does have a combo list
[0:39:13] <brachydios777> Some heat moved are straight up murder
[0:39:19] <tsunderecactus0> We have an ability and heat move list, is there a combo list too
[0:39:19] <@Menitta> I love what being drunk does in the Dragon Engine games. It fucks up movement and you sway side to side
[0:39:19] <brachydios777> *moves
[0:39:21] <Kiraklene> it has a list
[0:39:26] <%HollowedIdjit> there is one
[0:39:28] <CappuccinoGuil> @brachydios777 never killed anyone
[0:39:30] <dead_harmony13> He's coming chat
[0:39:31] <DSD24> Woolie is a time traveler
[0:39:31] <tsunderecactus0> Did I just miss that one in the menu
[0:39:36] <%HollowedIdjit> or at least a list of all heat moves
[0:39:51] <+krispen_wa> we're getting closer to THAT moment
[0:39:54] <user_naim> Do heat moves mess up if you input movement, or just with other attacks
[0:39:54] <misterurbanthelegend> Norio Wakamoto was a cop and was a part of Riot Division.
[0:39:55] <FuumetsuKuroi> PogChamp
[0:40:02] <brachydios777> WE DO IT?
[0:40:03] <tsunderecactus0> Just a list of all the combo routes and finishers would be nice to have
[0:40:04] <+Koover> he just wants to talk
[0:40:07] <%Th3SmartAlec> hmmmmm
[0:40:07] <%Zayasu> touchy 🍌
[0:40:07] <sonofthedeepsouth> oooooh

[0:40:15] <brunoberserk> TCH
[0:40:19] <dante_suoh> I really love the feel of the golden gun in this game, Good damage and heat gain, plus the reload animation cancel glitch make it feel like a McCree high-noon
[0:40:19] <DSD24> Here comes the men in black!
[0:40:22] <%HollowedIdjit> i think that's under general move list
[0:40:26] <@Menitta> @user_naim nah, heat moves are just pressing Y/triangle

[0:40:51] <boyman0427> @user_naim you get transported to the beat down dimension whenever you start a heat move, so nothing can interrupt it
[0:40:53] <CappuccinoGuil> You trying to go up? WE'LL KILL YOU

[0:43:19] <Jalexster> Only big things get auto-grabbed, I think
[0:43:23] <%X2Eliah> Can you grab in beast style?
[0:43:26] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Not all items get auto grabbed
[0:43:26] <brachydios777> Certain objects are automatic, not weapons
[0:43:27] <WG101> heya, asshole
[0:43:28] <tsunderecactus0> The auto-grab is for environmental objects only

[0:43:32] <%Javaa01> Small weapons don't get grabbed by beast, just all the big stuff
[0:43:33] <+furiousfurioso> I think it only works on like "objects" where real weapons you have to do a normal grab
[0:43:33] <rhaya2> yooo
[0:43:34] <Jalexster> Motorcycles and signs and stuff get-auto-grabbed, but not small objects or weapons
[0:43:34] <Solidnick18> yooo
[0:43:36] <tsunderecactus0> Not enemy weapons

[1:19:01] <%Asuterisuku> Majima is the protaganist of this game.

[1:19:05] <brian_peppers1> Kiryu really grows on you tho
[1:19:07] <%eyezehuhh> Majima true protag
[1:19:09] <chainsaw105> this game is 100% Majima's story
[1:19:13] <Halospaz117> Honestly this game is more Majima's than it is Kiryu's
[1:19:14] <DasFreekman> Yakuza 0 is MAJIMAS game
[1:19:16] <VidulaSaix> Kiryu's fantastic but Majima will forever be my favorite
[1:19:17] <jorniev> THIS IS MAIN PLOT FOR ME
[1:19:19] <gustavozxd> mahima is the actual 0 protagonist
[1:19:24] <+Mendin> Kiryu is the hero, but Majima is the Main Character
[1:19:25] <Pookiedaexzile> This is Majimas story and Kiryu is here for no reason
[1:19:26] <+Tora_draw> how long the steam been on?
[1:19:26] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> 300 bucks
[1:19:34] <%Asuterisuku> His abilities don't need as much cash as Kiryu's do.
[1:19:35] <+krispen_wa> kiryu is a static character from the minute he's born. he has NO character arc
[1:19:35] <AhmCha> I think statistically, the game is 60/40 Kiryu/Majima

[1:37:09] <+Shoosler> never not killed
[1:37:11] <+kewlmyc> Majima has 100% killed people. This game implying otherwise is stupid
[1:37:13] <%doomerskeletor13> Jebaited haha funny joke
[1:37:17] <skeletonknifefight> just testing the murder waters

[1:38:15] <lucky_icarus> Yagami's action has led to people's direct death. dunno if that counts.
[1:38:23] <misterurbanthelegend> Majima is likely to have killed less people than Kiryu.

[1:38:31] <%cache_22> Sagawa is also in the Yakuza and Majima is a civilian right now.

[1:55:58] <%X2Eliah> Remember how Woolie kept telling Reggie to lock onto enemies?
[1:56:04] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> I'm not gonna complain since Woolie is just losing his Shakedown virginity, but know that this strat is amateurish at best.
[1:56:11] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Woolie will lock on at Chapter 8
[1:56:13] <cheaddos> mr. orrah
[1:56:17] <Timurine> Buy skill now?

[1:56:52] <fuji_92> ORA
[1:56:54] <+Ether101_Prime> The bikecycles are some of the best weapons in the game.
[1:56:56] <Nekros4442> use a heat move?
[1:57:00] <%doomerskeletor13> Lame it out
[1:57:03] <Solidnick18> use a item
[1:57:06] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Woolie really needs to learn to abuse heat moves
[1:57:07] <+krispen_wa> weapon heat
[1:57:11] <Nekros4442> rip heat
[1:57:13] <%cache_22> I'm sure Woolie will learn different strats over time. I hope we see more heat moves though.
[1:57:16] <VidulaSaix> Yeah weapons would really speed it up
[1:57:19] <Kiraklene> object + heat
[1:57:21] <brianthe12th> you really gotta use a variety of heat moves on em, instead of just slowly whittling em down with combos
[1:57:24] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> Exactly.
[1:57:29] <%Asuterisuku> Spend the money on moves as you hit him!
[1:57:30] <Lieutenant_America> Once Woolie learns a later style, he will annihilate shakedowns
[1:57:32] <WotanCR> i dont
[1:57:33] <Komayeda> send woolie ur energy everyone

[1:57:43] <%alwaysneedcaffiene> essence of cheesing

[1:57:51] <%doomerskeletor13> The second style he gets is my go to for Shakedown
[1:57:53] <CappuccinoGuil> This is a dicey situation. No upgrades, no items, can barely keep heat, so no heat moves
