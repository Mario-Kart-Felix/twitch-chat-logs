[0:07:01] <%MyNameIsRasus> IT MAY BRING FEAR
[0:07:02] <+thesyndrome> I've actually never seen UNS4, so I'm wondering if it's more accurate to the anime/manga than thew others were (considering where the last game left off, there's not too much left)
[0:07:03] <hassanico2> Naruto bois back
[0:07:03] <fist_wizard_jay> TIME TO SAVE THE NINJA WORLD
[0:07:08] <+SilverInferno3> Woolie saving 2020 with his Nindo
[0:07:13] <DaBelovedUnderdog> This going super epic
[0:07:13] <Diana869> is this the game with the rad opening?
[0:07:14] <Megagumballs> yeah nibbbbbbaaasss
[0:07:16] <%Fujiwara_92> Naruto it UP
[0:07:18] <biomegabear> So who in chat has a masters degree in naruto lore for woolie when he has questions?
[0:07:18] <hassanico2> @thesyndrome It's so accurate they literally use anime stills for half the cutscenes...
[0:07:19] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:07:24] <BallerSwagBro9k> @thesyndrome Story wise its 100% faithfuk to the manga

[0:07:27] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @leatherjacketswag
[0:07:28] <%arkv01> this intro BGM is getting too good for the woolieTRASH we are
[0:07:28] <Megagumballs> im in my zooom class but yeah nibbbbbas
[0:07:32] <VidulaSaix> Minh should be able to handle most of it
[0:07:33] <+thesyndrome> @hassanico2 lol awesome
[0:07:35] <%gatorafan> @diana869 that Woolie can't see because apparently it's BIG SPOILERS
[0:07:35] <%luckybudman> luckybudman subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[0:07:38] <Malikwest11> ....was he warned about counters?
[0:07:42] <Morning_Asakura> NUNS4 is the most beautiful anime game next to arcsys stuff
[0:07:46] <DasFreekman> NUNS4? Now I'm M O T I V A T E D
[0:07:46] <%MintMuffinGamer> I'm wondering if this was the New LP or The back up to the Back up LP?

[0:07:49] <HereComestheChief> WE BACK IN BOIS PogChamp

[0:07:51] <hassanico2> @thesyndrome I meant that in a bad way though cause they're just not animated LUL
[0:07:52] <SpookySpaghooti> @VidulaSaix Minh wont be able to handle anything after Dokapon
[0:07:55] <%MyNameIsRasus> WE BACK IN?
[0:07:58] <%MyNameIsRasus> WE NEVER LEFT SON
[0:07:59] <VidulaSaix> And yeah I told Minh to make sure Woolie doesnt watch the intro yet, though Im sure he knew already

[0:08:31] <%SuperKirby24> Gotta teach us them jiutsu signs Woolie Kappa
[0:08:35] <+SilverInferno3> This game's opening spoiling the game is very faithful to that one opening of the anime that spoiled a ton of shit

[0:09:12] <+spacehouse> Cheer1500 I hear you about Wonderful Everyday and I totally understand. Instead I recommend reading The Steppenwolf, as W.E. is based on many of the same philosophical themes and mind-altering perceptions. W.E. along with Kotor2, Planescape Torment and Deus Ex are in my opinion excellent games to play, and, once you dig a little deeper, the gaming equivalent of gaining eyes on the inside. speaking of which, would love to see you give Deus Ex 1 a try.

[0:20:23] <%lotharrio> @JohnAtDawn XCom has a new game coming out, and the enemy unit Viper, a large snake-woman, is now part of the protagonist group. Also, the developer is leaning into the fact that people sexualised the unit. There's images of what look like a Viper strip bar in screenshots.

[0:21:35] <%OUTheTeam> it has been a journey of highs and deep cavernous lows
[0:21:35] <niddron> dude, for all the dumb stuff Naruto did, the last pop off is fucking great
[0:21:37] <%andrei11dr> I completely dogged Bleach somehow
[0:21:39] <+GreenCMD> the dumb shit is the best part tho
[0:21:41] <+CoronetChris> I can't remember where I gave up caring, like at some point I just continued just to continue.
[0:21:41] <%ECRead> every single Pain fight was cool
[0:21:42] <countgaculatv> Ohhhh we’re far from the finish line
[0:21:48] <VidulaSaix> Yeah the pop offs in this game are some real good shit
[0:21:49] <%jiggy_snipe> PogChamp Sheningan Eyes!!!
[0:21:51] <+thesyndrome> "Shenanigan Eyes" thats so good
[0:21:54] <WanderingSwordsman> Bring out that Wooliegan
[0:21:55] <tsnakesrule> I love bleach

[0:22:01] <Lysdexic9541> The Shenanagan
[0:22:03] <therealtacopancakes> saskeeeeeeeee
[0:22:08] <Daba_mk2> Deus ex is great
[0:22:11] <+Grayhammatter> the shenanigans
[0:22:12] <0rond> for real though, the intro is HYPE AS FUCK and the song is FOKKIN SICK but it's also insanely spoiler dense, you've gotta skip it
[0:22:19] <Personified134> the Shenanigan eye is so much stronger than the Wooliegan
[0:22:22] <tsnakesrule> Even the garbage year arc
[0:22:28] <+thesyndrome> I don't know if woolie can handle deus ex 1, even I can barely deal with it these days
[0:22:29] <giogio346> im watching bleach for the first time and i love it so far. but i guess im not at the "bad" parts
[0:22:34] <%Riottrio> Woolie still needs to watch/read the scenes with Shikamaru vs Hidan because the games completely downplay the actual events for NARUTO FIGHT BADGUY HAHAHAHA

[0:24:34] <%Superbro64> Salt, blood and honor is fine and all, but I have a rather serious question: if your actual friendship came at risk, would you cancel the LP? Cheer600
[0:24:36] <%lotharrio> Yakuza 0 is great.
[0:24:36] <%Solidnick18> you would like 0
[0:24:37] <%MyNameIsRasus> Yakuza 0 is sick
[0:24:37] <BallerSwagBro9k> DAME DAME...
[0:24:37] <+SilverInferno3> @biomegabear Yes, though there's also the Road to Boruto DLC but I don't know if Woolie's gonna touch that lol

[0:24:48] <%andrei11dr> Yakuza 0 is awesome and it's a best starting point
[0:24:48] <0rond> also nuns2 was the first game to have the woolie/reggie/minh team which is now standard
[0:24:50] <BallerSwagBro9k> MR. SHAKEDOOOOWN
[0:24:51] <+khalcipher> Nooooo
[0:24:52] <%Solidnick18> yakuza 5 is still my favorite
[0:24:57] <biomegabear> @SilverInferno3 is boruto worth going through
[0:25:04] <%MyNameIsRasus> But those are the best part
[0:25:04] <+Ilpala> yo how long has the prince been up there creepin
[0:25:06] <BallerSwagBro9k> @biomegabear No
[0:25:06] <Zayasu> the sidequests are amazing in 0
[0:25:06] <%Javaa01> You're never gonna be able to do all the side content in one run
[0:25:08] <+Kamennoo> and in order its literally the most far back in the past the games go
[0:25:09] <%SuperKirby24> is it even worth doing NUNS 1 at this point Kappa
[0:25:10] <+SilverInferno3> @biomegabear I honestly never gave it a try lmao
[0:25:10] <VidulaSaix> The side quests in that game are some on camera shit for the most part too cause they're real good
[0:25:11] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Personified134
[0:25:11] <%saltpiggu> length is nothing now that your streaming
[0:25:12] <+Ancopro> you'd def not one to skip sidequests in 0
[0:25:13] <VidulaSaix> So it'd be a long one
[0:25:13] <broraging99> that lp is where the woolie leg lore came from
[0:25:15] <shadowsofpain> WoolieVs Yakuza? yes please
[0:25:15] <kingdtacoz> NORT BORT AND SNORT Spread it
[0:25:15] <%OUTheTeam> yea, kinda sucks cause the sidequests are great
[0:25:16] <+thesyndrome> the side quests don't feel like work, because they are usually funny
[0:25:16] <wendigo172> @biomegabear the manga kinda is
[0:25:17] <Merkensteiner> NEVER BEFORE SEEN RESULTS
[0:25:17] <biomegabear> thats 2 no;s
[0:25:22] <ky_79> Its as long as you want it to be
[0:25:23] <niddron> NUNS is the only LP with a custom intro, thus being the best LP
[0:25:23] <%MyBulletsLAG> Play Nioh 2 for the snek ladies
[0:25:25] <+CelioHogane> @biomegabear the anime? Yeah. The manga? ehhh still pretty good.
[0:25:27] <MonsterEnvy> It will be shorter then Knights of the Old Republic
[0:25:30] <fist_wizard_jay> Mr Shakedown is coming for those POCKETS
[0:25:35] <biomegabear> 1 yes 2 nos and a read the manga
[0:25:36] <BallerSwagBro9k> BRUH
[0:25:37] <%gatorafan> offscreen grinding may be required
[0:25:38] <%lotharrio> Collect all the sex cards! Go on all the sex dates!

[0:25:51] <tsnakesrule> 0 is 100 hours if you try everything 100%
[0:26:04] <kingdtacoz> Live action what?
[0:26:05] <%MyNameIsRasus> It already has
[0:26:12] <DefiniteRobot> There was a point in Giant Bomb's run of Yak 0 where they just got fans to send them clips of fun stuff to see before they ended the series. Maybe a viable solution to sidequest density?

[0:28:32] <RayCSmooth> And the Intro
[0:28:33] <+chikitsune9> PokBlastoise
[0:28:36] <+SilverInferno3> Also the intro to the game
[0:28:36] <VidulaSaix> Yeah definitely skip those
[0:28:38] <VidulaSaix> And FAST
[0:28:38] <countgaculatv> Quantum_Cholo vs Satsui no Pingas
[0:28:39] <%xx123manxx> LITERALLY rushed out of bed when I saw this notif on my phone LETS FUCKIN GOOOO
[0:28:45] <biomegabear> but without context I dont know whats happening in that
[0:28:51] <nepwar> japan loves to spoil
[0:28:52] <NiktenKing> SKIP THE INTRO
[0:28:54] <%Fujiwara_92> Skip the intros
[0:28:55] <BlackTriStarXO> maybe he might have the road to boruto intro
[0:28:59] <%Superbro64> the japanese dont give a shit about spoilers I suppose
[0:29:04] <Sol_Install> YEYEYE
[0:29:07] <NiktenKing> INTRO IS LIKE NIER LEVEL SPOILS
[0:29:07] <Sol_Install> we're DOING THIS
[0:29:14] <VidulaSaix> Yeah, it spoils the upcoming chapter. Skip them instantly
[0:29:14] <%andrei11dr> Just close your eyes and feel the Nart
[0:29:16] <%MyNameIsRasus> INTRO SPOILS THE WHOLE GAME
[0:29:19] <%omenzazu> naw watch the intro
[0:29:24] <Needwagon_for_speedwagon> Get your headbands on, my nakamas.
[0:29:25] <Brutalyte616> So how long do we have to wait until we're back to Madara?
[0:29:27] <xiidrifty> Literally the first frame of the intro is a spoiler
[0:29:27] <nepwar> japan will reach their end game status and just post the ending on the box art
[0:29:28] <irfan_> god the intro with boruto dlc installed is awful
[0:29:30] <MonsterEnvy> Chapter intros are fine
[0:29:30] <@Solidus_113> The chapter intros are kinda dumb
[0:29:31] <biomegabear> If woolie has questions & ,mihn doesnt know just consult chat
[0:29:31] <foghornleghorn55> The game is targeted at people who know the story
[0:29:34] <%MyBulletsLAG> is this that game about Boruto's dad??
[0:29:37] <%xcompleasedad> xcompleasedad subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 2 month streak! On the plus side, don't need to watch the show now Kappa
[0:29:38] <%Mr_Pylon> Just in, what's getting played?
[0:29:41] <Sedrelic> between chapters is no problem
[0:29:42] <%omenzazu> aaaaghh it's not like it matters since you know the end game
[0:29:45] <%OUTheTeam> that's fine
[0:29:48] <%omenzazu> it's more like a peak
[0:29:49] <dastmwolf> Which arcs does Uns4 cover?
[0:29:50] <+SilverInferno3> Intro is rad tho, but i think it also has copyrighted music? So probably best to skip it anyway
[0:29:54] <%Prinnylordninjocity> @brutalyte616 a few hours at least
[0:30:00] <biomegabear> @Mr_Pylon Naruto
[0:30:00] <@Solidus_113> yeah do that

[0:30:25] <centuronstar> NINJA BATTLE
[0:30:27] <%McSoliace> thats homework

[0:30:35] <niddron> @nepwar That one guy!
[0:30:46] <biomegabear> Its a decent game
[0:30:52] <+thesyndrome> anyone who can accurately tell you the specific NUMBER of the tutorial in question knows what they are talking about
[0:30:53] <c3k1996> maybe don't watch the intro of the game, but pls give it a listen. it is fire!
[0:30:55] <@Solidus_113> DO NUNS4 AFTER THE LP IS DONE
[0:30:56] <hamahiroyuki> also, fun fact: the story finished before in the storm game series (with the release of this one) the anime
[0:30:58] <nepwar> that one guy is like the guy that curves the entire class grade
[0:30:59] <@Solidus_113> I'LL BE IN THERE
[0:30:59] <%SuperKirby24> yeah might as well go 4
[0:31:04] <masterfire23> sign me up
[0:31:08] <%coreyyotto> The earlier ones have the most systems though
[0:31:16] <%MyBulletsLAG> Get into Fighting Games: that Kung Fu Panda fighting game
[0:31:16] <%Kriss1827> @solidus_113 SAME
[0:31:16] <%andrei11dr> 5 is the one with the most i thought
[0:31:16] <brunoberserk> whens narutimate hero accel 2 ?
[0:31:24] <HyperMinus> Oh God I've been waiting for this! I'm so glad I can catch this live!!!
[0:31:25] <%Prinnylordninjocity> That’s fair
[0:31:25] <Chisas_Dead_Body> It should be GEKITOU NINJA TAISEN SPECIAL
[0:31:26] <Sedrelic> nun to nuns
[0:31:27] <VidulaSaix> GNT4 wouldn't be a bad idea in terms of gameplay though
[0:31:27] <%andrei11dr> I only played 5
[0:31:30] <plushysceptile> But does it have Lars from Tekken?
[0:31:33] <+SilverInferno3> @hamahiroyuki Oh yeah lmao that's right!
[0:31:37] <%Fujiwara_92> DO NARUTIMATE ACCEL LUL
[0:31:38] <%coreyyotto> Like, there are just random gamecube Naruto fighting games that have wicked crazy shit in them

[0:31:42] <%SuperKirby24> or was that the clash of ninja revolution series, I forgot

[0:32:04] <Diana869> has there been a single 2d naruto fighter?
[0:32:05] <Chisas_Dead_Body> Unfortunately
[0:32:07] <biomegabear> @facuvillamil oh god I played that, they took out functions in fear of spoilers
[0:32:08] <%Prinnylordninjocity> And systems are kinda fun too, best of any anime fighter I’ve played
[0:32:23] <nepwar> i wish one piece got the same type of love that NUNS gets
[0:32:23] <biomegabear> dimps makes bad sonic games but good fighters?
[0:32:24] <%coreyyotto> @Diana869 there have been a bunch, but they're all on GC/PS2
[0:32:28] <%andrei11dr> Ultimate Hero is the Smash clone right?
[0:32:30] <VidulaSaix> NUNS games arent bad once you get in there but there's definitely not very much depth for sure. It's more the visual appeal
[0:32:33] <Chisas_Dead_Body> Definitely
[0:32:52] <%MyNameIsRasus> @andrei11dr I think that's D.O.M

[0:39:03] <%jiggy_snipe> Wifi warriors leave DansGame
[0:39:06] <Mrbaconator> powerline adapters are THE SHIT
[0:39:10] <+Grayhammatter> red bars go home
[0:39:11] <%Binary_Fireball> what
[0:39:17] <%Superbro64> powerline adapters dont work if your house's wiring is shit tho, so keep those receipts
[0:39:17] <theredfox930000> the online warrior
[0:39:18] <%Binary_Fireball> WHAT
[0:39:22] <%Riottrio> why is english so bad that in media res and in medias res both correct
[0:39:25] <%Superbro64> sajamSegue3 sajamSegue4
[0:39:26] <nepwar> unless your wiring is fucked then you know,
[0:39:28] <%GrassCannon> interesting
[0:39:32] <Diana869> iam not smart enough to do that
[0:39:44] <Mrbaconator> it doesn't work for everyones house if the wiring is bad but if it works IT WORKS
[0:39:47] <+Dr_DangerPhD> they also have a version that can run on the coaxial cables in your house
[0:39:48] <Psyramics> it's a box you plug into an outlet
[0:39:48] <FackinCrazy> oh so its mostly useless
[0:39:52] <Personified134> @Riottrio english is spoken in a lot of different places and no one wants to bother going to war to settle it
[0:39:56] <fist_wizard_jay> Kirbo demands more blood for the blood pool
[0:39:57] <%Riottrio> Gonna be buying a powerline adapter soon now, I'm moving my computer to a different room and can't take the Wifi
[0:40:08] <%nothuzad> @Diana869 you just plug it into the socket and connect it witht he pc - if it gets internet=good if it doesnt=refund
[0:40:12] <%Struggleful> Knock your router if you're getting comboed. Wifi Strats
[0:40:15] <Morning_Asakura> it works when it works
[0:40:16] <VidulaSaix> Why not just buy a long cable instead then?
[0:40:19] <+thesyndrome> I use a powerline adapter, it's so much faster than using the wifi
[0:40:21] <releasetherats> it's SUPER useful like i have a few
[0:40:22] <Sedrelic> cat 5e is super cheap
[0:40:28] <%ekodrop> if the breakers are connected then it'll work, but it'll be shit
[0:40:28] <%Binary_Fireball> WOOLIE THANK YOU SO MUCH
[0:40:30] <Psyramics> the signal quality varies greatly based on the quality of the wiring and also how much load is on the circuit
[0:40:35] <%Binary_Fireball> that is super useful knowledge
[0:40:36] <MattDemers> @VidulaSaix Some people can't drill holes, and some people can't just run a cable if they're sharing space with people

[0:40:45] <nepwar> is any powerline adapter good or is there a specific one to ge
[0:40:45] <+mechslayer71> I use it and it works great

[0:40:46] <gustavozxd> did the game start yet?
[0:40:46] <dundore77> Also depends on your house. if the power outlets are too far apart/too old then it can be worse than wifi.
[0:40:49] <+thesyndrome> it's the next best thing

[0:50:10] <+mechslayer71> Insert Dokapon
[0:50:13] <WiredAbyss> As someone who was frustrated by how Naruto wrapped up Im interested to see Woolies opinion.
[0:50:14] <sonofthedeepsouth> LONGMAN
[0:50:18] <Deadbulky> Thankfully this Storm is linear and not gonna make u do dumb sidequests
[0:50:19] <%CaptainPileDriver> no, we are not fighting dreamers
[0:50:20] <%lewdskeletor13> 0 is real good
[0:50:20] <+OddityOn> @woolieversus absolutely skip the CHAPTER PREVIEWS those are the only real spoilers
[0:50:21] <%Solidnick18> alot of them are pretty good but some are just heartfelt quests
[0:50:24] <releasetherats> yeah, Yakuza 0 would be dope
[0:50:29] <worldbrand> doing the sidequests offscreen would defeat the purpose
[0:50:29] <Fabric_tester> Boruto's son grandad

[0:50:41] <%CaptainPileDriver> we are all the Naruto Shippuden ultimate ninja storm 4
[0:50:45] <%arkv01> might be ahot take but maybe not yakuza 0, theres already an LP on the old channel

[1:52:21] <rosemon5001> but but they use the filthy machina only we are allowed to do that @Tobiwan95
[1:52:24] <Klefth> Wait, the framerate is THIS shitty on PS4? LUL
[1:52:26] <Leonheart777> We musou now PogChamp
[1:52:34] <%Th3SmartAlec> Isn't it funny how 80% of Jonin are weaker than most Genin's
[1:52:39] <Klefth> I thought it was a PS3 game
[1:52:43] <Star_Platinum_> May good frame rates find you in this trying time
[1:52:43] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:52:51] <+tearknack> @alephalpha the only majore difference i know of between pre village era and vilalge era is that the villages exist and have big shcools, isntead of just large lcans teaching their kids. both had child soldiers
[1:52:53] <+PulsinFufu> !uptime
[1:52:54] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 52 minutes
[1:52:55] <C4m3r0n0409> PS4 Game for sure
[1:52:58] <+Grayhammatter> chakra LOAD
[1:53:02] <nepwar> load that chakra for a big finish
[1:53:03] <%Th3SmartAlec> CHAKRA WAVEDASH PogChamp
[1:53:04] <+ggbhtg> Chakra Korean Backdash
[1:53:06] <alephalpha> fair
[1:53:06] <VidulaSaix> PAUSE MENU LUL
[1:53:07] <+PadreHail> The framerate is primarily cuz they used a shit ton of particle effects for each big money fight and it absolutely obliterates the engine
[1:53:07] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[1:53:08] <Reizie_Etherealm> LUL
[1:53:11] <alephalpha> not a big naruto fan
[1:53:11] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[1:53:14] <tusk_act4> LUL
[1:53:15] <%andrei11dr> I got some chakra loads right here Kappa
[1:53:24] <Tobiwan95> Wouldn't that many shadow clones be canonically impossible?
[1:53:27] <%Th3SmartAlec> @alephalpha I don't think Naruto fans are Naruto fans
[1:53:29] <nepwar> i won't make you suffer - says man you sends 100 clones at the child
[1:53:42] <Jetfandam> we all know who obito is though and you could explain it in 1 sentence. Obot gets injured in war, madara saves him and kakashi gets the eye.
[1:53:44] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Jobber Naruto
[1:53:45] <+tearknack> @Tobiwan95 i think so?
[1:53:49] <0pirus> killer them all kakashi
[1:53:51] <irfan_> SUMMON LOGS
[1:53:51] <MTLxSpider> yeah but what if its more than one person summoning clones :thinking:
[1:53:51] <+hawk_rush> don't worry about it LUL
[1:53:53] <VidulaSaix> Rin using a log LUL
[1:53:55] <%Lion_kun> it looks like a Musou game now
[1:53:59] <+tuchpi> jermaIQ
[1:53:59] <GManx0> Remember when Naruto used to have rules?
[1:53:59] <%Th3SmartAlec> But we're later in the series, so this is no longer considered special
[1:54:03] <+PadreHail> Remember the shadow clone jutsu was a SECRET TECHNIQUE
[1:54:04] <+tearknack> i was always udner the impression the elemental clones were easier to make than shadow clones
[1:54:04] <usurper_sos> Nah, that was retconned
[1:54:06] <+JonThePrettyOKGuy> he only had like 20 in the anime
[1:54:07] <alephalpha> @Th3SmartAlec I wouldn't know all my knowledge is second hand I think I've seen lik 3 episode of naruto tops
[1:54:07] <+CommanderBrocken> minh oh my god
[1:54:09] <%mankeyfigh> no it's the same guy
[1:54:09] <dundore77> they aren't the same type of clones they are probably just regular clones
[1:54:10] <framewindowcleaner> Nothing in Naruto makes sense
[1:54:10] <%SuperKirby24> damn since when were we playing uzumaki chronicles Kappa
[1:54:14] <%Th3SmartAlec> @PadreHail EVERYONE KNOWS IT
[1:54:14] <rosemon5001> LOOOOOG
[1:54:18] <nepwar> DID SHE SUMMON A FUCKING LOG
[1:54:18] <hassanico2> LOG NO JUTSU
[1:54:20] <Reizie_Etherealm> Ah yes, my ultimate technique THE LOG
[1:54:20] <%andrei11dr> Maybe he took chakra steroids
[1:54:27] <Deadbulky> LOGS
[1:54:28] <+Rabbitmage> Girl ninjas aren't as strong as boy ninjas
[1:54:30] <+cinder_chan> @Jetfandam I do think it's important you see how similar obito was to naruto though
[1:54:32] <+MagicBeanBurrito> There's 2 different types of clone, Naruto knows the forbidden type
[1:54:32] <+VGGary> yellow flash boiii
[1:54:32] <@Solidus_113> THE BOY
[1:54:33] <0pirus> female no jutsu
[1:54:33] <+Grayhammatter> she summons rollings logs? what?
[1:54:35] <Jetsfantasy> This is just filler to give you more of this fight type, but remember Naruto's shadow clone technique was from that forbidden scroll
[1:54:36] <%gatorafan> this are jobber clones, totally different Kappa
[1:54:37] <VidulaSaix> LUL
[1:54:37] <+tearknack> @PadreHail wrong. it was a forbidden technique in the hidden laaf village, at one specific point in time
[1:54:38] <nepwar> Does that mean she has a contract with a fucking piece of drftwood
[1:54:41] <%SiegsCorner> BIG WIFFS LUL
[1:54:44] <MTLxSpider> is that Boruto's granpa
[1:54:46] <%MyNameIsRasus> DON'T BLINK
[1:54:49] <+PulsinFufu> what's the highest rank inochiThink jonin?
[1:54:56] <Arek_1> @Jetfandam Madara's interaction with Obito hasn't been shown yet here. Careful.
[1:55:03] <+Rabbitmage> highest rank is kage
[1:55:08] <Star_Platinum_> Is that Boruto's dad's son's grandpa?
[1:55:13] <Reizie_Etherealm> Genin -> Chunin -> Jonin
[1:55:20] <VidulaSaix> No one cares
[1:55:20] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> "this kid is beating me"
[1:55:22] <%mankeyfigh> kinda lame
[1:55:24] <%Th3SmartAlec> "Why are these child so OP?!"
[1:55:25] <%MyNameIsRasus> Is there seriously no lock on?
[1:55:25] <hassanico2> "Hmmm maybe child soldier ninjas are a good idea"
[1:55:29] <Zayasu> is this fun? Kappa
[1:55:29] <+TiddlywinkUmbry> hold circle and charge chidori
[1:55:32] <%GrassCannon> Child soldiers are a pretty good idea after all
[1:55:32] <Jetsfantasy> If highest rank is Kage, why isn't the lowest Hikari? 🤔
[1:55:34] <EndgameContent> [Kakashi slashing at empty air] These ninjas are unbelievably skilled...
[1:55:36] <+VGGary> ye you can charge kakashis chidori i think
[1:55:37] <Tobiwan95> Ninja army hirarchi makes no sense
[1:55:37] <+PadreHail> Forbidden until suddenly taught to every single kid in class
[1:55:38] <Star_Platinum_> Kakashi in outer heaven when?
[1:55:39] <+PulsinFufu> but not everyone can be kage right? doodSweet or are there other kage level of power
[1:55:39] <+VGGary> if you hold it longer
[1:55:42] <+JonThePrettyOKGuy> oh yea chaining the chidori
[1:55:45] <@Solidus_113> you can charge a lot of specials
[1:55:47] <42nfl19> Kage is not a rank, slight spoilers but Naruto is still a Genin as a Kage in teh new anime.
[1:55:48] <+tearknack> actually its genin -> chunin -> "special" jonin -> jonin -> kage
[1:55:49] <+OddityOn> you're charging you're attack by holding it

[2:08:27] <biomegabear> I wanna see some LVL3s
[2:08:28] <phatmac16> he was a jounin, no?
[2:08:32] <+PadreHail> How has Minato not shown up already is my question
[2:08:37] <%arkv01> cause he's a CHILD
[2:08:42] <Tobiwan95> use the ultimate
[2:08:47] <+SilverInferno3> @PadreHail He's off fighting another battle at the moment IIRC
[2:08:48] <C4m3r0n0409> WOOLIE TRIANGLE CIRCLE

[2:09:02] <nepwar> not enough eyes
[2:09:03] <Klefth> He doesn't have the shenanigans to use it
[2:09:06] <+MagicBeanBurrito> he doesn't have the SIGHT
[2:09:09] <+cinder_chan> minato is busy slaying puss behind enemy lines
[2:09:11] <Personified134> no sharingans
[2:09:11] <LordGoodrick> It's too obvious - it's like telegraphing a sword thrust from 10 metres away
[2:09:16] <%coreyyotto> Wasn't the whole point that you needed a Sharingan to control it?
[2:09:17] <%MyNameIsRasus> In the show
[2:09:20] <hamahiroyuki> i think tenten would be transparent in person. she has such non-existense she'd be fading out of existence
[2:09:21] <+JonThePrettyOKGuy> Minh's ass
[2:09:21] <Klefth> Minato says that before that last battle
[2:09:22] <%mankeyfigh> what is he talking about?
[2:09:22] <%rubbishbinge> Chidori/Raikiri causes tunnel vision
[2:09:23] <+MagicBeanBurrito> early in the gaiden
[2:09:25] <%Fujiwara_92> in the anime, in the manga ?
[2:09:25] <the1ax2man3> In gaiden
[2:09:25] <+Memitim> it's a tunnel vision effect
[2:09:27] <%arkv01> @cinder_chan that's my headcanon minato too
[2:09:28] <Arek_1> Minato says so.
[2:09:30] <Tobiwan95> Wasn't it kakashi training sasuke?
[2:09:30] <+hawk_rush> yep
[2:09:32] <ghostspartan80> no shenanigans unlocked yet
[2:09:32] <the1ax2man3> Yes in Gaiden

[2:09:38] <+SilverInferno3> During where that mob battle would be
[2:09:39] <AllenDeadman> gaiden yes
[2:09:40] <%MyNameIsRasus> Minato says it
[2:09:42] <%lotharrio> The first time he uses it. It's so fast, all he can do is move in a straight line and Minato is like, "That's trash against a good fighter."
[2:09:42] <+ggbhtg> @WoolieVersus The game is NOT gonna tell you
[2:09:44] <+BopBeep> Take a guess wools
[2:09:44] <%coreyyotto> Might've been when he trained with Naruto to develop the Rasen-shuriken
[2:09:45] <%mankeyfigh> what is raikiri?
[2:09:45] <countgaculatv> Kakashi just can’t see well

[2:09:58] <Klefth> Minato says that before that last battle, when kakashi shows off his raikiri
[2:09:58] <NickHatesSnow> that dodge animation tho
[2:10:00] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Yes, Chidori gives you tunnel vision without Sharingan
[2:10:01] <nepwar> smoking sick
[2:10:02] <centuronstar> The problem is the move is telegraphed way too easily. The only way you could use it is if you had the reflexes and sight to be able to probably tag someone with it
[2:10:03] <Tobiwan95> PogChamp
[2:10:09] <XxBigNerdxX> minato says that it's too dangerous cuz he's vulnerable to counter attacks

[2:33:35] <+Vivaciousx3> think you can just target guruguru
[2:33:36] <sgtgoatmilk181> as far as I recall, Obito's eye jutsu activates so he slipped through layers of rock until to reached the cavern. Or am I misremembering?
[2:33:38] <hassanico2> He's just sitting there doing stretches LUL
[2:33:43] <saiyan24675> @th3smartalec yes

[2:33:48] <Arek_1> @Th3SmartAlec You're asking why they didn't come back for Obito? I think Obito was stuck in enemy territory.
[2:33:48] <Shishi1205> 100 was max reward

[2:55:14] <+Vivaciousx3> LUL
[2:55:15] <+Bluydee> he got edo tenseid so he had to have died
[2:55:17] <%jiggy_snipe> wait

[2:55:18] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[2:55:18] <$cherubs_anonymous> This is a nightmare
[2:55:19] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[2:55:19] <+GreenCMD> real Madara killed himself immediately after
[2:55:20] <+MagicBeanBurrito> good ol 30sec delay
[2:55:20] <%Robot_Nixon_> @Solidus_113 @knowyourenemy_97 can we get a timeout or ban?
[2:55:20] <%Fujiwara_92> LUL
[2:55:21] <countgaculatv> Madara is the scariest name
[2:55:23] <allenpie04> Edo Tensei no longer exists
[2:55:23] <C4m3r0n0409> DUDE REANIMATION
[2:55:24] <NiktenKing> He dies after giving his will to Black
[2:55:25] <%xx123manxx> that was in the cutscene LUL
[2:55:25] <C4m3r0n0409> LAST GAME
[2:55:25] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Voldemort
[2:55:27] <Malik1002> he died on the seat
[2:55:27] <Lelfro> you did?
[2:55:28] <+Seiryu99> he said "until i am reborn"
[2:55:28] <+Stupid121v2> You totally just watched that happen lol
[2:55:30] <MonsterEnvy> Kabuto reanimated Madara
[2:55:30] <sgtgoatmilk181> @woolieversus Nah Woolz, Madara is dead, thats how kabuto had his body to revive him
[2:55:30] <%jiggy_snipe> idk if Woolie wants to be spoiled
[2:55:31] <nepwar> you saw the zombie madara with the comet dude
[2:55:31] <Arnoldoaad1> to be fair the game didnt show it well
[2:55:31] <+OddityOn> Because Madara is the Boogeyman of the Ninja world that's why
[2:55:32] <%masterpiecejeremy> Madara Speaks Kikongo confirmed
[2:55:35] <bunnyscruff> How could he sell
[2:55:38] <+knowyourenemy_97> relax
[2:55:39] <bunnyscruff> fuck
[2:55:41] <allenpie04> its fucked
[2:55:41] <+chikitsune9> @woolieversus Madara is a brand name, it has the most clout.
[2:55:42] <C4m3r0n0409> Year
[2:55:42] <+JonThePrettyOKGuy> He reanimated, so like, duh he died
[2:55:42] <Shishi1205> More
[2:55:42] <%andrei11dr> That's why they can bring back he's reanimation @woolieversus
[2:55:42] <bpbranmuffin> The name madara invokes fear. Thats basically the only reason
[2:55:43] <+tuulu_t> @woolieversus Have any of you guys tried reading Umineko (the visual novel)?
[2:55:45] <+Seiryu99> he died at the end of that cutscene
[2:55:45] <%Fujiwara_92> yeah, 1 year
[2:55:46] <gustavozxd> said no and left
[2:55:46] <VidulaSaix> you'll learn more about what happened there in time
[2:55:46] <+GreenCMD> he disconnected from the tree
[2:55:47] <+Stupid121v2> GAME POORLY SHOWED HIM DYING
[2:55:48] <%krispen_wa> wait, if he was gonna call himself madara as an alias, why did he need Tobi as a double-alias
[2:55:51] <countgaculatv> What’s the benefit of saying you’re Voldemort?
[2:55:51] <%MyNameIsRasus> 1 yearish
[2:55:52] <+chikitsune9> one year
[2:55:55] <Halfeatenoreo> its implied at the end of the scene that madara is dead
[2:55:56] <Tobiwan95> there will be another flashback
[2:55:57] <+ineek10> yah running around recruting ppl as Madara is better then as Obito who is a nobody

[2:57:00] <VidulaSaix> That part is meant to be confusing right now. You'll get more information later. @WoolieVersus
[2:57:00] <+tearknack> will we find out in the game?
[2:57:00] <tolloponik> the sharigun Super activated

[2:57:05] <%Robot_Nixon_> @knowyourenemy_97 u sound mad
[2:57:05] <+Memitim> watch the anime
[2:57:07] <Arek_1> Did Woolie notice the level of Obito and Kakashi's Sharingan in that moment?
[2:57:08] <+chikitsune9> she killed herself on his arm
[2:57:09] <+Bluydee> @jontheprettyokguy it gets explained really soon
[2:57:10] <%andrei11dr> Going around as Madara is like basically someone walking around today with the name Adolf Hitler, it's to invoke fear @woolieversus
[2:57:10] <Lysdexic9541> Teen Gets Penetrated While Crowd Watches
[2:57:11] <Jetsfantasy> Remember he doesn't have Uchiha endurance
[2:57:11] <%Fujiwara_92> and obito goes ape shit and kills a ton of ppl
[2:57:11] <helidzz> he awakened the mangekyo
[2:57:11] <+sevorai> She’s dead, he passed out from awakening the mangekyo
[2:57:12] <countgaculatv> You think the game would actually convey why Kakashi kills Rin?
[2:57:13] <Lelfro> Sharingan activated from tragedy
[2:57:13] <gustavozxd> sharingan II
[2:57:14] <dolphinbj> big chakra tired
[2:57:15] <allenpie04> Get a Phoenix Down
[2:57:17] <%MyNameIsRasus> Correct
[2:57:17] <niddron> Kakashi passed because he and obito both awakens their ultimate sharingan
[2:57:19] <%mankeyfigh> MANGEKYO
[2:57:19] <Deadbulky> Kakashi blew his load all over her insides and was done for the night Kappa
[2:57:22] <%rubbishbinge> Rin's death awakens Mango
[2:57:23] <sgtgoatmilk181> Kakashi passed out cos his life fucking sucks
[2:57:33] <357Sneak> lytNOTIKETHIS KAPOW lytAGH FBBlock MorphinTime
[2:57:34] <gustavozxd> SeemsGood alright minh
[2:57:34] <Halfeatenoreo> its implied that madara died at the ems of the scene tho passing on his ideals to obito
[2:57:39] <MonsterEnvy> @WoolieVersus Madara is currently in the current age because Kabuto reanimated him
[2:57:41] <+ggbhtg> @WoolieVersus Obito will actually say more about it in-game
[2:57:43] <+hawk_rush> good thoughts
[2:57:44] <overkrustice> The game wanted to be clear that MADARA just died
[2:57:44] <allenpie04> EVERYTHING is off right now
[2:57:44] <Arek_1> @WoolieVersus Did Woolie notice the level of Obito and Kakashi's Sharingan in that moment?
[2:57:45] <phatmac16> watch the fight of thid
[2:57:51] <MonsterEnvy> So Madara is currently around as a Zombie
[2:57:58] <+ggbhtg> @WoolieVersus Obito will actually say more about it in a cutscene
[2:57:59] <nepwar> just remember to not take all speculation as hard truths
[2:58:04] <phatmac16> Watch the anime fight
[2:58:06] <+Memitim> watch the anime fight
[2:58:09] <+Vivaciousx3> @WoolieVersus people are saying you should watch the obito scene when you have time
[2:58:09] <+MrRabbles> uchiha brand
[2:58:09] <+JonThePrettyOKGuy> Maybe answer 0 of Woolie's questions until he beats the game?
[2:58:10] <sgtgoatmilk181> the anime version of Obito's rage is worth the watch
[2:58:17] <%krispen_wa> fight the anime watch
[2:58:18] <countgaculatv> Watch anime fight
[2:58:22] <+MrRabbles> Uchiha is the nike of the shinobi world
[2:58:23] <+ggbhtg> Big anime watch time tho
[2:58:23] <Tobiwan95> They both got ther mango shinenigan at that moment. You saw it for a few frames
[2:58:24] <Fabric_tester> Mist
[2:58:26] <+MagicBeanBurrito> The anime remains the best way to understand the anime plot
[2:58:27] <%Fujiwara_92> obito going ape shit is cool agreed
[2:58:30] <nepwar> anime the fight watch
[2:58:32] <+knowyourenemy_97> @this_is_marco you sound offended and annoyed.
[2:58:33] <allenpie04> Anime the watch fight
[2:58:35] <+ggbhtg> Biggu anime watch time
[2:58:36] <chippa250> Anime fight was pretty good like madara opening
[2:58:38] <0pirus> mango shenanigan
[2:58:40] <Halfeatenoreo> The game implies that he dies, he has to be dead by the ninja war anyway in order to be brought back with the zombie jutsu
[2:58:40] <overkrustice> naah
[2:58:41] <%masterpiecejeremy> The anime version of Kakashi vs obitio will be 1000X cooler than the gamer version
[2:58:42] <overkrustice> It's fine
[2:58:44] <countgaculatv> The anime fight is metal af
[2:58:44] <%Robot_Nixon_> @knowyourenemy_97 lol ok

[3:10:36] <+chikitsune9> he's 17
[3:10:36] <allenpie04> ADULTS
[3:10:37] <+GreenCMD> the goal is that it doesn't matter cause everyone will be alive in the dream world
[3:10:42] <Shishi1205> Same age as kakashi
[3:10:42] <+donpatrondx> Obito listened to too much devil music

[3:54:52] <Picosunloaded> hey man just wait
[3:54:53] <%MyNameIsRasus> Obito is just a SIMP
[3:54:53] <mikalwoods> super simp
[3:54:53] <VidulaSaix> he has his moments but his motivation is pretty stupid
[3:54:54] <phatmac16> JUST A SIMP
[3:54:59] <%Fujiwara_92> obito get two good moments and that's it @WoolieVersus
[3:55:00] <vaderxyz1970> Well that was PAIN
[3:55:01] <Tobiwan95> yes
[3:55:02] <+ggbhtg> No, memes aside, Obito is ACTUALLY a simp
[3:55:03] <Personified134> None of these villains have anything going for them whatsoever, they're all dogshit
[3:55:03] <Magoloso> MY CRUSH DIED!
[3:55:03] <Deadbulky> True
[3:55:03] <ELFucilaNeroIV> He is just a yes man
[3:55:04] <+Dimfish> hes just a simp whos angry
[3:55:05] <Shishi1205> LUL
[3:55:05] <Morning_Asakura> you expect to much out of kishimoto woolie
[3:55:07] <countgaculatv> That's Pain
[3:55:08] <zenith0111> WORST SEQUENCE OF SCENES
[3:55:09] <ALTRNico> so was naruto
[3:55:10] <Damie904> That was Pain, Woolie. Obito's just a puppet.
[3:55:11] <%Kazuhira_Boat> That was Pain
[3:55:13] <niddron> he was...simple
[3:55:14] <Personified134> Pain was the only good villain in naruto
[3:55:15] <%lotharrio> He's basically Naruto, if he got picked up by Orochimaru?
[3:55:15] <%Th3SmartAlec> Obito would have asked Kakashi why
[3:55:16] <%FuqBoiSlim> Incel Naruto
[3:55:16] <+WeepProphet> simp rage
[3:55:17] <Tobiwan95> This isn't LOTGH woolie
[3:55:18] <%jiggy_snipe> Naruto was also dumb
[3:55:18] <releasetherats> i miss Pain tbhSos
[3:55:19] <Profmcsteevie> I never smashed, so now I smash you
[3:55:20] <%ChoculaUltra> Obito has BIG school shooter energy.
[3:55:21] <phatmac16> Just boring simp
[3:55:21] <+Dimfish> my middle school crush died
[3:55:22] <%nintega010> Kishimoto isn't Oda
[3:55:25] <%the_vedo_show> atpRtsd atpRtsd goddamn simp
[3:55:26] <+Dimfish> not even like his wife or some shit
[3:55:26] <Deadbulky> It was an act
[3:55:27] <+Rabbitmage> Obito is just a pawn
[3:55:30] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Pain come back, please!
[3:55:32] <+Dimfish> just some girl he knew in middle school
[3:55:33] <+knowyourenemy_97> Basically a evil Naruto
[3:55:34] <sgtgoatmilk181> Obito at least gets one of the best fights in all of shippuden
[3:55:35] <+ggbhtg> @WoolieVersus Pain had the good characterization
[3:55:38] <gustavozxd> tbf being alone for more than 10 years after that doesn't help much
[3:55:38] <%Fujiwara_92> everyone is just a pawn Kappa
[3:55:38] <Morning_Asakura> pain was so good
[3:55:38] <MonsterEnvy> Madara is pretty cool
[3:55:38] <+captain_history> He gets a bit more later
[3:55:39] <%jiggy_snipe> Naruto and Obito are just the same character with two different paths Kappa
[3:55:40] <+TiddlywinkUmbry> Part 1 of Naruto outclasses Part 2 by so much
[3:55:40] <bbblaketwitching> He is the worst/most boring parts of both sasuke and naruto
[3:55:40] <VidulaSaix> He has a reason. He just took that reason way too far
[3:55:45] <Arnoldoaad1> he soes get a little more depth in the next fightbut not that much
[3:55:45] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Pain was pretty cool
[3:55:46] <gekizenbu> who's mask is it anyways, the game where the characters made up and the definition doesnt matter
[3:55:49] <transporterthesequel> Well like, Madara’s plan is to literally drag everyone to dream heaven for world peace
[3:55:53] <%krispen_wa> Obito somehow destroyed a village and ran the entire Hidden mist at the age of 15 while also being a giant fucking manbaby
[3:55:55] <+TiddlywinkUmbry> Obito was better when he was goofy Tobi
[3:55:57] <%Kazuhira_Boat> Pain was so much better than Obitobi
[3:56:05] <biomegabear> could hinata take neji's eyes and boost byakugan like sharingan users do?
[3:56:05] <Damie904> Obito is mad that Rin died so fuck this world.
[3:56:07] <+Dimfish> obito just sucks
[3:56:07] <bbblaketwitching> Tobito
[3:56:08] <Magoloso> When Rin died Obito realized he wasted a lot of money on her PAtreon
[3:56:08] <Morning_Asakura> it shouldve ended with the pain arc
[3:56:10] <mrgary004> also conan didn't heal
[3:56:11] <+Memitim> Pain was the best the series got, for sure
[3:56:13] <%Fujiwara_92> Tobi > Obito
[3:56:19] <Lildmarsh24> Did someone say Conan and Evilak?
[3:56:20] <ALTRNico> obitobitobitobito
[3:56:22] <%coreyyotto> Part of it is the same motivation as Pain's. He blames the perpetual state of war for his pain, and he believes that Madara's plan is the only way to end that cycle of war.
[3:56:22] <%Th3SmartAlec> The problem with all the Shippuden villains is that they want to end suffering by making everyone suffer way more
[3:56:23] <+ggbhtg> Konan didn't heal either LUL
[3:56:24] <+MrRabbles> Tobi was fun
[3:56:24] <%xx123manxx> I want Konan to step on me fr
[3:56:24] <%cumurasame> I'll be honest Sasuke does Obito's motivation better. BURN IT ALL DOWN TO START IT UP AGAIN.
[3:56:25] <Tobiwan95> Obito lost his childhood crush, that's literally it
[3:56:25] <BallerSwagBro9k> @biomegabear Yup but she doesnt have the balls LUL
[3:56:25] <bunnyscruff> The death of Obito's girl should've just made him go crazy and become tobi
[3:56:25] <%jiggy_snipe> actually yea, Obito is Naruto if he became Sasuke
[3:56:29] <Reizie_Etherealm> It's like Kishimoto wanted to swerve him but didn't know which direction would be good so he just swept Obito under the villain rug and be done with it
[3:56:32] <%MyNameIsRasus> @krispen_wa I've seen actual manbabies run much more than that
[3:56:36] <XxBigNerdxX> yo can I turn off the censor in the chat lol
[3:56:38] <+LTKonnor> Obito is the ultimate simp
[3:56:38] <+knowyourenemy_97> one out of a million girls, that was Rin
[3:56:39] <%ChoculaUltra> reminder - Obito was totally cool with dying to protect his friends until he wasn't.
[3:56:40] <Fabric_tester> Obitobi just wanna dream forever

[4:06:03] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:06:04] <+SilverInferno3> @zenith0111 What he means is that Obito gave up on humanity and hope for the world, his cynicism triggered by Rin's death. He doesn't care for her life, just that the world is shit and should be replaced

[4:06:33] <+knowyourenemy_97> Oh no
[4:06:42] <zenith0111> @captain_history There are like a million other ways he could've done it especially if it's just about some genjutsu meaning dragging everyone else in is beyond petty and dumb
[4:06:42] <+knowyourenemy_97> RIP his career
[4:06:42] <Shishi1205> change of art yeah
[4:06:46] <%ChoculaUltra> damn, Kishimoto has a wrist wrap just like Naruto and Sasuke post-series?!
[4:06:46] <%Th3SmartAlec> Despite my feelings, being a Mangaka is rough
[4:07:18] <hamahiroyuki> mangaka life is fucking rough. jump mangaka is even worst
[4:07:18] <zenith0111> @silverinferno3 I know but he was having his cake and eating it
[4:07:27] <+captain_history> @zenith0111 Yeah but Madara is the same about that even with a even more vague motivation. Both are basically "fuck everything about this world".
[4:07:27] <+Bluydee> his art really gets weird after shippuden but then gets back into a groove by the start of the war
[4:07:46] <Arek_1> Kishimoto's successor's work in Boruto was ROUGH at first.
[4:07:46] <%nintega010> This is why I'm ok with ODA taking breaks on One Piece.
[4:07:47] <%rubbishbinge> Seeing him draw live is pretty cool
[4:07:57] <%FuqBoiSlim> Reminder Togashi broke his back over Yuyu Hakusho. Manga is rough kids
[4:07:59] <Dapper_Cactuar> while I'm not really a fan of Naruto as a whole, he did a DAMN good job on the art as time went on
[4:08:01] <Shishi1205> Araki for example
[4:08:09] <zenith0111> @captain_history Yeah lots of villians have really bad motivations in Naruto. I agree
[4:08:10] <+SilverInferno3> @zenith0111 I means there's no doubt Obito went crazy, he was manipulated by Madara during an especially vulnerable moment. He's not meant to be thought of as rational
[4:08:10] <irfan_> the boruto manga art shines with its new characters
[4:08:19] <%masterpiecejeremy> @WoolieVersus Look out your window. It's snowing
[4:08:21] <+HawkGoggles2> Eyeshield 21 is strongest for me.
[4:08:21] <ALTRNico> yuyu hakusho PogChamp
[4:08:22] <Shishi1205> Old dragon ball manga is OD tho
[4:08:26] <%krispen_wa> and sometimes you get tite kubo doing sameface and the HxH drawer doing squiggles
[4:08:28] <Mr_Rakjo> Oda can take all the breaks he wants, manga its great and it would suck for him to hurt himself
[4:08:31] <+knowyourenemy_97> Did the Berserk author had back problems?
[4:08:33] <FackinCrazy> Bleach
[4:08:33] <%rubbishbinge> Oh lord Eyeshield
[4:08:37] <+knowyourenemy_97> I don't know
[4:08:41] <Klefth> Alita goes through MAAAASSIVE changes
[4:08:47] <SideChar> Rave master
[4:08:52] <%nintega010> @Mr_Rakjo Yep. That's why we let him be
[4:08:53] <zenith0111> @silverinferno3 Which is why I'm chastising him for not being rational LUL
[4:08:56] <Shishi1205> Bleach went from having backgrounds to not having one
[4:09:02] <%ChoculaUltra> Bleach's art evolution is probably some of my favorite. Kubo can't write a story to save his life but goddamn does his art SLAP.
[4:09:04] <%FuqBoiSlim> @knowyourenemy_97 I'm not sure. I believe he's just kinda of a perfectionist
[4:09:14] <Dapper_Cactuar> Eyeshield 21 and One-Punch man also have amazing art
[4:09:15] <+SilverInferno3> @zenith0111 Haha, go ahead, just wanted to clear some things up since you and the other guy seemed to be talking in circles lol
[4:09:19] <Shishi1205> Kubo busted out the brush so much
[4:09:20] <+Bluydee> you can pinpoint it as the very first chapter of the timeskip
[4:09:21] <357Sneak> Inoue's art is Gorgeous
[4:09:21] <niddron> @shishi1205 yeah that one was obvious
[4:09:29] <garrulousAuthority> @ChoculaUltra I literally just want a Kubo fashion catalog
[4:09:30] <%SuperKirby24> monkaS Kreygasm
[4:09:33] <Arek_1> Yeah, Tite Kubo of Bleach hated backgrounds later on.

[4:13:06] <%ChoculaUltra> Plague's analyses are kino. Something about his calm voice dismantling the things I loved as a kid.
[4:13:08] <+knowyourenemy_97> Plague video is full of spoilers
[4:13:08] <+OddityOn> No
[4:13:09] <Picosunloaded> no
[4:13:11] <@Solidus_113> No the NUNS4 Team supers
[4:13:19] <%Wool> NUNS4 has team supers
[4:13:21] <%rubbishbinge> It was a joke video but yeah
[4:13:25] <+paladinstarbuster> Naruto was NEVER about hard work
[4:13:25] <gustavozxd> @niddron I think it depends, it's definetly not human shaped though, there's probably different versions but never human shaped
[4:13:36] <+ggbhtg> @WoolieVersus No, there's super budget versions either way
[4:13:38] <Halfeatenoreo> team supers are like tag supers
[4:13:38] <reg806> woolie are you keeping up to date on jojolion?
[4:13:43] <Arek_1> @niddron Bad Dragons are big and abstract in design. Mostly "dragon like."
[4:13:48] <Klefth> Neji's death is WAY more rough in the manga/anime
[4:13:48] <irfan_> fell
[4:14:01] <%prime_name> What?
[4:14:03] <%optimasmaximas> yeah....
[4:14:04] <Halfeatenoreo> if you have certain teams they do specific supers with 3 taps of the triangle button
[4:14:05] <Shishi1205> Correct
[4:14:05] <%SuperKirby24> wut
[4:14:06] <%ChoculaUltra> Neji means screw.
[4:14:06] <%jiggy_snipe> screw and bolt

[4:14:37] <Wooliam> That's fucking stupid!
[4:14:37] <gamewarden92> Obito was right, everything eventually turns to garbage.
[4:14:39] <%xx123manxx> I think Himawari was his favorite flower or some shit... I fuckin forgot
[4:14:39] <%jiggy_snipe> i guess you could just name him Nejo too
