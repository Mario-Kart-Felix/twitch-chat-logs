[0:35:02] <+thedream_c> not with that haptic feedback
[0:35:04] <dds333a> Oftentimes GP is blockable, its full charge that goes through
[0:35:06] <+polothegreatest> Pc cheaper but hackers
[0:35:12] <tentavision> ps5 would be too hard to carry into a tournament anyway

[0:37:44] <+thedream_c> Samsho had to give out the good will tho

[0:37:51] <DSD24> @Modern_Myth Lord Jimmy Bones
[0:37:54] <+thedream_c> since Samsho was trying to re-establish itself as an IP
[0:37:54] <+Modern_Myth> @jiggisnipe cool cool thanks !

[0:38:53] <cartakus> never
[0:38:56] <DSD24> That super hard DLC
[0:38:57] <leith_aziz> @thedream_c Dude, Samsho seems to already have had more sales than GGs, which really seems wack when I look at how much views some content has gotten pickySad

[0:39:22] <+thedream_c> u know it, we know it
[0:39:25] <RD_NX> I've been getting my ass kicked every time I go online this game
[0:39:27] <andre11dr> Apparently Elden Ring is long af too
[0:39:35] <DSD24> It will happen
[0:39:38] <cartakus> IT HAS TO
[0:39:41] <+thedream_c> Galactica? teh RALF 5D will happen more often than not
[0:39:42] <brachydios777> Maybe one day but definitely later than soon
[0:39:46] <+Jiggisnipe> will Reggie get hit by tho? Kappa
[0:39:50] <odd_slater> Reggie in danger
[0:39:51] <dds333a> Ángel climax is a bit eh
[0:39:51] <+thedream_c> Angel is angel
[0:39:52] <DopeyDragon> Anhel
[0:39:53] <RD_NX> requires a parry for angel yeah?
[0:39:53] <secretbosssauce> Reggie sweating
[0:39:59] <andre11dr> Reggie WILL eat the Galactica
[0:39:59] <+Cuon_Alpinus> Luong climax for DA CULTURE
[0:40:00] <dds333a> She isn't as wild as '02
[0:40:01] <xUrbanCarnage> I might land Angel climax
[0:40:04] <joshua_42> Shame Galatica is blockable now it sucks
[0:40:06] <$ggbhtg> Simply play one of the hardest characters in the game, they say
[0:40:07] <dds333a> But still CRAZY
[0:40:14] <+kewlmyc> Angel is usually considered the hardest character to learn in the roster.
[0:40:16] <andre11dr> Angel is mad hard to play
[0:40:19] <DSD24> Angel is cute tho
[0:40:30] <dds333a> @joshua_42 usually it is, only full charge is
[0:40:30] <+cmac92> That's cap LJB he played 02 um
[0:40:32] <+thedream_c> yeah KOF already plays its own game and Angel plays her own game
[0:40:33] <Aussie_Manny> Anǵel

[0:41:31] <+thedream_c> but i'd love to see it
[0:41:32] <+kewlmyc> Krohnen is K9999
[0:41:35] <dds333a> @aussie_manny the accent is on the a
[0:41:42] <+kewlmyc> Flat out stated in the story
[0:41:43] <RandoChris> K9999 being taken out because of Akira
[0:41:44] <+starrich55> Ayo when's Khushnood Butt
[0:41:45] <+Jiggisnipe> Krohnen is K9999 and there was no legal trouble
[0:41:46] <DopeyDragon> K9999 is krohnen
[0:41:48] <$ggbhtg> Krohnen IS K9999, revealed in his team ending @WoolieVersus
[0:41:56] <leith_aziz> I assume you mean the character with the Akira lawsuit risk
[0:41:57] <andre11dr> @dsd24 Eh ,he looks tiny here compared to the 13 version
[0:41:58] <+thedream_c> nameless, kfour9

[0:42:15] <+thedream_c> same armor, different wearer
[0:42:15] <dds333a> he literally is him
[0:42:16] <DopeyDragon> Nameless is seperate, but Krohnen IS K9999
[0:42:18] <DSD24> @andre11dr Too be fair everyone was mad buff in 13 Ralf and Clark especially
[0:42:20] <BlackermanZX> its 200% confirmed hes the og K9
[0:42:25] <%CaptainPileDriver> oh yeah the labcoat 21 is being shown off today on strea
[0:42:26] <Sonicdy> Hes canon k9999
[0:42:32] <joshua_42> Ángel literally calls Krohnen K9999
[0:42:32] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:42:34] <+kewlmyc> Krohnen is canonically K9999
[0:42:35] <%CaptainPileDriver> *stream* and she has a level 1 command grab
[0:42:35] <RD_NX> Angel calls him K9999 in the ending cutscene
[0:42:44] <%townzzzzz> K9999 grew out his hair
[0:42:45] <$ggbhtg> Krohnen is literally K9999, it's revealed in his team ending @WoolieVersus
[0:42:47] <+thedream_c> the tetsuo drill?
[0:42:48] <%Shad0wTag> Nameless is non canon anyway
[0:42:48] <dds333a> Yep
[0:42:51] <+thedream_c> he should
[0:42:52] <+Jiggisnipe> @WoolieVersus the legal stuff was all a hoax according to the discord
[0:42:54] <dds333a> He absolutely did
[0:42:58] <andre11dr> He had the meat arm
[0:43:01] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> The forehead takes 2 character slots
[0:43:02] <+thedream_c> yeah the meaty arm
[0:43:04] <dds333a> Nameless had different fire
[0:43:07] <+RunawayOcean> RunawayOcean subscribed with Prime. 
[0:43:10] <%jinking79> they didn't like k9999 design and lied bout the copyright
[0:43:16] <tentavision> if i don't hear an are you ok on steam today I'm rioting
[0:43:22] <leith_aziz> Apparently not from what I understand
[0:43:22] <hasansviewcountbot> man those glasses are too stylish
[0:43:34] <dds333a> Jinju my girl LUL
[0:43:34] <Sonicdy> He is canon k9999
[0:43:36] <leith_aziz> Also Benimaru is one haircolor away from Pollnareff
[0:43:38] <+polothegreatest> The copyright bit is funny  LUL
[0:43:39] <brachydios777> Nameless not k9999, Khronen is k9999
[0:43:44] <IceyCone> If copyright was an issue beni would not have existed
[0:43:45] <SrHassan> Angel calls him K9999 in the ending cutscene
[0:43:46] <+cmac92> maybe they was scared of getting sued by Akira s
[0:43:46] <+thedream_c> I think they wanted to dodge ANY resemblance or reference
[0:43:47] <Rojo_Hou> I think it's just the designers at the time didn't like how blatant the reference was
[0:43:49] <DopeyDragon> @WoolieVersus Might be related to Eolith inventing the character or something?
[0:43:50] <+thedream_c> where people mistake it
[0:43:52] <Man_in_the_Red> and in a genre thats lead by SF2, a game with Stroheim in it
[0:43:56] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> Alright off to work, will be listening here and there
[0:44:17] <cartakus> yup
[0:44:19] <leith_aziz> I think they didnt want to risk it with a movie liek Akira cohhHmm
[0:44:25] <+thedream_c> yeah we understand people holding out for the RING
[0:44:30] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> One last thing, I think SNK said that there wasn’t any lawsuit worries
[0:44:36] <DSD24> Sifu was real good

[0:51:43] <DSD24> What was Terry's girlfriend who died? Sulia?
[0:51:48] <+xZKCd> shunei is alright his tie is dumb but his moves are fun

[0:52:00] <%Shad0wTag> God the lets watch from back then
[0:52:03] <+thedream_c> having EX moves outside of max mode is the best idea
[0:52:07] <+ConLin_Arts_> Who this third chad?

[0:52:26] <DSD24> Its good that Terry's hanging out with Blue Mary now
[0:52:29] <+thedream_c> just to carry over the whole t7 power level strength
[0:52:36] <%zeroarturia> @dsd24 only in the fatal fury ovas. Those are not canon
[0:52:41] <$razielhex> @thedream_c you want the Geese to be Cheese?
[0:52:46] <dds333a> They solidified yeah
[0:52:48] <%townzzzzz> good ol KoF 2015
[0:52:53] <+thedream_c> depends how cheesy
[0:52:59] <dds333a> But between '95 and '96, shit CHANGED
[0:53:03] <+thedream_c> because Geese played 2D rules in a 3D game
[0:53:12] <+thedream_c> buuuut in a 2D game... he gotta cheese differently

[0:53:42] <andre11dr> I meant the first one
[0:53:46] <DopeyDragon> 13 is still a VERY different game from 14 and 15 though
[0:53:47] <+thedream_c> super inputs vary

[0:54:08] <+thedream_c> the weird timing is canceling off DP motions with double 236
[0:54:13] <DSD24> Look at these heroes
[0:54:19] <%AlteisenReiseZ> A LOT of knowledge can transfer over from XIV. It's good for the people who've played before
[0:54:22] <JoePReal> lordji1MyGee lordji1Refill
[0:54:24] <+thedream_c> tell em JIMMY

[0:54:51] <brachydios777> Iori looks great
[0:54:58] <+polothegreatest> That hold button trick is neat
[0:54:58] <%slayabee> I've come around to Meiten imo
[0:54:59] <+ConLin_Arts_> I like how you see his hands in Reggie's camera
[0:55:04] <andre11dr> Iori ,mad good as usual
[0:55:05] <+thedream_c> yeah XI had wild wild sstuff
[0:55:05] <+Jiggisnipe> KOF always got the drip
[0:55:06] <DSD24> He doesn't have those silly leg belts either
[0:55:07] <$razielhex> Iori's gonna play bass guitar for a visual kei bang that dresses in baroque dresses and definitely has a harpsicord player.
[0:55:08] <xerotwo> I love to see these three fight against an online team of three LUL
[0:55:13] <%Shad0wTag> I better see no one play shunei chat

[0:55:40] <+Superbro64> SNK Heroines and future spinoffs COULD BE those future battle system experiments @woolieversus
[0:55:45] <dds333a> dodging is still real useful, but yeah
[0:55:49] <bonechamp4lyfe> just release CVS2 if you want grooves lol
[0:55:50] <+thedream_c> oh yeah SNK heroines was an interesting concept
[0:56:00] <+Superbro64> If SNK make Garou 2 next, they could do whatever the hell they want @woolieversus
[0:56:00] <DSD24> You guys got teams? Right now I'm rolling Robert, King, Leona
[0:56:04] <$razielhex> can't believe they put their profiles over Shermie's portrait.

[1:05:35] <Xeno351> man it's crazy that minh grew dreads and put on blackface but it is in character

[1:07:46] <+thedream_c> idunno. SOmetimes SNK leaves really good designs alone forever
[1:07:49] <DSD24> I do like that Isla thinks that Ash's green fire is really cool looking
[1:07:56] <enerkaizer> Iori as a pimp looks so weird
[1:07:57] <andre11dr> I just want Rugal back
[1:07:58] <+thedream_c> I thought LIen Neville had a charming ass design as a femme fatale

[1:08:06] <squiffy_jet> I like to think that Sakurai is playing this right now with dual Controllers

[1:09:22] <sans_roxanne> This game's soundtrack is actually really dope.
[1:09:34] <+thedream_c> man imagine a super wild card DLC team in year 2: Duck King, Zarina, Mian
[1:09:51] <squiffy_jet> @enerkaizer Look up his Smash demos, he would play both characters with 2 controllers at the same time
[1:09:52] <DSD24> Kukri and his cursed face
[1:09:55] <dds333a> All about the approach
[1:10:14] <enerkaizer> @squiffy_jet I know, I just made a dumb old meme joke ;)

[1:11:10] <%townzzzzz> LUL
[1:11:11] <DopeyDragon> the sand teleports are so damn cool
[1:11:13] <Dhurkst> @polothegreatest it's canon, though. DM games are non-canon
[1:11:15] <andre11dr> Reggie also never uses her do which is super good
[1:11:16] <kamenriderkickk> Peace out
[1:11:17] <brachydios777> It be cool to have a Metal Slug character as a fighter
[1:11:18] <xerotwo> BONK
[1:11:19] <nintega010> dang it
[1:11:19] <@Solidus_113> LUL

[1:11:30] <Man_in_the_Red> i saw the douboe throw from a mile away
[1:11:31] <DSD24> I want Fio to be playable
[1:11:35] <%CaptainPileDriver> jimmy calling out the punishes makes reggie choke harder and harder
[1:11:38] <+thedream_c> you can probably jump it
[1:11:42] <dds333a> Sports Team is EXACTLY the team that comes back for people to be like "HEY REMEMBER THEM?"
[1:11:46] <%Mathochism> Fio is playable in Maximum Impact.
[1:11:58] <+thedream_c> Sports team is just Ballers on Fire aesthetic
[1:12:00] <xerotwo> Does Marco count too?
[1:12:13] <brunoberserk> i like this new world of  ''top tier ralf ''
[1:12:21] <+thedream_c> if you play Smash, you may already be a lil familir with KOF neutral
[1:12:23] <+polothegreatest> @Dhurkst in the mean of roster
[1:12:27] <andre11dr> Short jump a lot
[1:12:32] <dds333a> Hop all day
[1:12:33] <enerkaizer> so... did they ever explain how Ash came back? I thought he erased himself from time
[1:12:37] <odd_slater> Team Metal Slug would be dope
[1:12:40] <+thedream_c> Kukri found Ash
[1:12:44] <%townzzzzz> if street fighter can have final fight in their games, KoF can get metal slug into theirs
[1:12:49] <Man_in_the_Red> @enerkaizer Verse brought everyone back
[1:13:00] <dds333a> @townzzzzz they do
[1:13:01] <IceyCone> @enerkaizer They did, yes l. Kukri's ending in the last game.
[1:13:04] <Nerdwarp112> @enerkaizer when Verse was killed in XIV all of the dead characters came back
[1:13:09] <andre11dr> @enerkaizer The final boss of the last game resurrected everyone when he died
[1:13:11] <dds333a> All non canon entries
[1:13:15] <Vashido22> SourPls
[1:13:18] <%PeteRocca> Love Kukri.
[1:13:18] <%townzzzzz> just some parts here and there
[1:13:27] <dds333a> But MS characters have been in MI and NGBC
[1:13:32] <SrHassan> i think Leona's dad also came back
[1:13:34] <+thedream_c> yeah the way the story opened up gave us a pretty buff roster in XV
[1:13:36] <%RandoChris> I love how the POW on the far left throws a fireball when a round is done.
[1:13:44] <enerkaizer> Ah, okay. so verse even ignored the laws of time and space LUL weird, but if people can keep their main then I'm okay with that
[1:13:45] <brachydios777> What are the chances of Rugal getting in?
[1:13:45] <SrHassan> cuz of verse stuff
[1:13:51] <Vashido22> Kukri being Dolores' adoptive son is neat lore
[1:14:01] <%townzzzzz> just maybe a metal slug team for the dlc
[1:14:02] <DopeyDragon> @brachydios777 on the way if the datamine is right
[1:14:03] <+thedream_c> I think Rugal has a shot
[1:14:10] <+thedream_c> Rugal and 'alive' Vice and Mature :p
[1:14:17] <dds333a> @enerkaizer bosses don't tend to be mains, and that was the majority of those resurrected by Verse LUL
[1:14:21] <brachydios777> nice
[1:14:21] <IceyCone> Rugal's cool and all but I also want Adelheid
[1:14:23] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Rugal, Krauser, Laurence XD
[1:14:24] <+thedream_c> Rugal is pretty popular
[1:14:25] <enerkaizer> what#s with Rugals son? Adelheid? I hope he gets in, I liked his design a lot
[1:14:30] <+bustawof> They should bring back rugal with krauser
[1:14:32] <Vashido22> We need Adelheid
[1:14:36] <Vashido22> bring him back
[1:14:38] <Man_in_the_Red> adelheid never
[1:14:43] <odd_slater> @thedream_c That would be dope
[1:14:43] <+the22cstomp> bring back freeman
[1:14:43] <andre11dr> This also means that all the NEST mofos are back
[1:14:46] <Carlioo> maybe a bernstein team
[1:14:50] <UnrealStyrofoam> @bustawof agreed
[1:14:54] <+thedream_c> i dunno. depends on overall popularity for 💰 sales too
[1:14:57] <DopeyDragon> adelheid got cucked bad in XIII
[1:14:59] <+kewlmyc> Yeah, bring back Adelheid
[1:15:01] <DingusMcBaseball> we need most of the boss characters in the game
[1:15:01] <enerkaizer> @dds333a I was just talking about ashs resurrection, the rest still feels hella off in generall to me
[1:15:23] <andre11dr> @kewlmyc Fuck no ,bring back Rugal proper
[1:15:30] <+kewlmyc> Could do both
[1:15:34] <dds333a> @andre11dr which version?
[1:15:38] <%RandoChris> I want Rugal's Pizzeria back
[1:15:45] <+thedream_c> bring back a 'nerfed' Rugal
[1:15:46] <gruulmagebeast> guys kukri can only count to 1
[1:15:52] <+thedream_c> which still means Rugal gets to play
[1:15:55] <andre11dr> @dds333a 2k2 ,with the kick moves
[1:15:56] <gruulmagebeast> im just waiting for yamazaki
[1:16:04] <$razielhex> @thedream_c A frugal rugal?

[1:17:10] <+kewlmyc> @Ricky_Rexx Any game is worth it. But you're going to learn two additional characters.
[1:17:18] <joshua_42> I miss when Ralf was a charge character
[1:17:29] <+cmac92> @ricky_rexx Yes your horniness will thank you
[1:17:30] <%RandoChris> I mean, you can do 1v1s but yeah
[1:17:32] <$razielhex> @Ricky_Rexx he's going to pick Shermie, Mai, and Luong, and never leave training mode
[1:17:40] <+thedream_c> worse case, buy the game on steam, play with shermie for 1 hour 30 minutes and see if you want to put more time
[1:17:42] <dds333a> @joshua_42 with his godly drop kick spacing move LUL
[1:17:43] <andre11dr> You straight get banned from Mexico if you pick Igniz in 2002

[1:18:38] <dds333a> In fact, Ash even stole Iori's Magatama, and nothing really comes of that
[1:18:47] <gruulmagebeast> reggie use standing hard kick it goes so far :(
[1:18:48] <dds333a> @kewlmyc beat me to it LUL
[1:18:59] <enerkaizer> Iori never gets his flame powers back, right? He still hasn't gotten them back
[1:19:02] <this_guy_115> @gruulmagebeast No, he's just a pyromancer like a bunch of the other characters, for example ralf who ALSO has fire attacks
[1:19:10] <dds333a> He got them back at the end of XIII
[1:19:11] <IceyCone> He got it back after XIII
[1:19:18] <this_guy_115> @enerkaizer he got them aftet ash deleted himself in xiii
[1:19:21] <+polothegreatest> we got flaless iori plagueSad
[1:19:22] <+kewlmyc> @enerkaizer He gets them back, hence why he has them in XIV and XV
[1:19:22] <orochiblood> @enerkaizer you just saw iori ingame using them lmfso
[1:19:31] <IceyCone> as you can see with Iori's uppercut :P
[1:19:38] <+thedream_c> THANK U dno7 dno7 dno7
[1:19:51] <enerkaizer> @orochiblood I was blinded to much by pimp iroris outfit to notice xD"

[1:19:55] <%RandoChris> At most, I think it's because of Ash being a descendant of Saiki that he can use fire powers? Maybe???
[1:19:56] <Nerdwarp112> Idk if this is an unpopular opinion or not but I prefer Shermie’s classic outfit over her new one. I just think it looks better.
[1:20:04] <andre11dr> I'm glad Iori got the flames back, I'm not a fan of claw Iori
[1:20:09] <+Ricky_Rexx> That mans in the background just vibing
[1:20:11] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Whip needs her gun back
[1:20:12] <dds333a> @razielhex LUL LUL
[1:20:22] <dds333a> @alteisenreisez GEDDORAN
[1:20:23] <brachydios777> Rugal's son looks cool
[1:20:27] <+kewlmyc> Yeah, I miss Whip just shooting motherfuckers
[1:20:35] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Also is this the first KOF with no Koreans? Wow
[1:20:35] <%PeteRocca> He's goooood.
[1:20:38] <IceyCone> I do like classic shermie, hope for classic costume dlc
[1:20:41] <+polothegreatest> DLC costumes potencials
[1:20:43] <enerkaizer> Maaaan... could you imagine the metal slug hostage becoming playable in a KoF?
[1:20:48] <+thedream_c> im glad SNK is back giving fan service with metal slug stage. STuff like that is  the best way to celebrate their IPs
[1:20:49] <+bustawof> I some garou terry Kreygasm
[1:20:54] <+bustawof> I wanna see
[1:21:02] <Nerdwarp112> @enerkaizer that’d be hype lol
[1:21:16] <dds333a> @enerkaizer with the hadouken and everything
[1:21:17] <+thedream_c> especially if its not a laggy stage too :)
[1:21:18] <odd_slater> XIV did costume stuff so it's possible on top of the two existing classic costumes
[1:21:31] <+kewlmyc> No way those are the only two costumes we get
[1:21:42] <odd_slater> Yeah
[1:21:45] <enerkaizer> @Nerdwarp112 His big super should be him using is boxer trunks somehow LOL
[1:21:48] <dds333a> Got TIME to play LUL
[1:21:48] <+thedream_c> costumes are nice but I also want a broader color palette
[1:21:49] <+kewlmyc> I'll be shocked if Kyo and Iori don't get classic costumes too
[1:21:49] <gruulmagebeast> dont forget youre here labbing forever
[1:21:52] <andre11dr> @odd_slater Terry has his Wild Wolf costume in this
[1:21:55] <this_guy_115> I hope they do at least a single arcade mode
[1:21:57] <brachydios777> Does this mean Metal Slug is cannon to KOF?
[1:22:01] <Nerdwarp112> @enerkaizer lmao
[1:22:03] <+thedream_c> XIII gave a taste of what a huge color palette could do
[1:22:06] <+elderpunch> we w jimmybones??
[1:22:11] <+polothegreatest> Just look SFV Dlc LUL
[1:22:15] <+kewlmyc> @brachydios777 Pretty sure its always been?
[1:22:17] <+thedream_c> i mean KOF kinda dips into the SNKverse so yeah
[1:22:18] <+the22cstomp> most snk games are canon to each other
[1:22:33] <gruulmagebeast> is the chick on the towel on the right a metal slug protag?
[1:22:33] <odd_slater> @andre11dr Yeah and classic Leona
[1:22:40] <+thedream_c> in the KOFverse chars that 'died' in their respective mainline titles live
[1:22:47] <%RandoChris> Nah, she's an NPC that you get items from sometimes
[1:22:47] <+thedream_c> so Geese is technically alive in KOFs version
[1:22:49] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Ralf and Clark, Athena, they're their own games
[1:22:53] <this_guy_115> @gruulmagebeast She's an npc
[1:22:54] <andre11dr> 11 brought in a bunch of guests from other SNK games
[1:22:54] <IceyCone> It's canon to an extent, and Ralf, Clark and Leona appear in metal slug
[1:22:56] <DSD24> That's the item lady
[1:22:58] <dds333a> it's like Lee(?) from Kizuna Encounter showing up in '02
[1:22:58] <Carlioo> @gruulmagebeast nah, just one of the supplier NPCs
[1:23:01] <+thedream_c> yeah Athena is from Psycho Soldier
[1:23:05] <+thedream_c> Ralf and Clark are Ikari Warriors
[1:23:17] <+kewlmyc> Yes, Geese never died in KOFverse. Makes Rock's relationship with Terry make no sense, but whatever.
[1:23:22] <%the_smiler_in_the_dark> stream out of scyc?
[1:23:24] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> Kinda hurts knowing Elden Ring coming means this game will evaporate doodSad
[1:23:37] <DSD24> @J33P3R5_CR33P3R Nah stay positive dood
[1:23:39] <%RandoChris> Geese is a shitty dad/husband so he probably abandoned Rock in KOF's timeline.
[1:23:42] <dds333a> @thedream_c hell, Ralf even appeared first in Tank III
[1:23:46] <+thedream_c> Rock may be a 'different' person too in KOFverse
[1:23:48] <enerkaizer> @kewlmyc I thought that, during this time in KoF, Terry hasn't adopted Rock yet, or something along those lines....?
[1:23:50] <IceyCone> Geese never cared about Rock, he wouldn't care that he ran off with terry
[1:23:54] <dds333a> Damn juggles
[1:23:54] <+the22cstomp> @J33P3R5_CR33P3R fighting game playerbases have no correlation with elden ring, also that game has a definitive ending
[1:23:57] <this_guy_115> Maybe he gets rock the first time he throws him off, so when he comes back Rock's already there
[1:24:03] <Carlioo> I love KOF juggles, they're so funny
[1:24:09] <IceyCone> Rock is canon, KOF has been almost Garou ever since 2003
[1:24:11] <%RandoChris> Geese is like DIO where he'd only care about his kid if he showed promising power.
[1:24:17] <enerkaizer> Rock for example doesn't show up in the Team fatal Fury ending at all
[1:24:30] <dds333a> @carlioo flashbacks to Jhun Hoon juggles LUL
[1:24:34] <+thedream_c> i forgot the 'first' time Rock showed up in KOF even as a cameo
[1:24:34] <this_guy_115> BUT he's mentioned in the secret ending!
[1:24:43] <nintega010> @J33P3R5_CR33P3R people get both. I'm gonna get this soon and be able to play it after I beat all of Horizon
[1:24:44] <jotabranded> the far D
[1:24:52] <dds333a> @thedream_c as a cute little kid
[1:24:53] <this_guy_115> Secret ending team ||parents||
[1:24:53] <enerkaizer> @this_guy_115 The Team parents ending?
[1:24:57] <this_guy_115> yeah
[1:24:58] <%RandoChris> Rock had a super growth spurt between win posing with Terry in 2002 and 2003 Kappa
[1:25:00] <DopeyDragon> KOF canon is in a weird limbo between Fatal Fury 3 and Garou, since Geese is still doing Scroll shit
[1:25:06] <+kewlmyc> Rock is also the only character allowed to actually age as he was a small child in KOF 2001 but 16 in XIV/XV LUL
[1:25:06] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:25:10] <bonechamp4lyfe> i just feel like the old kof games are better than these newer games lol
[1:25:10] <+thedream_c> @dds333a which KOF though. I know he was in a win animation with Terry
[1:25:11] <UnrealStyrofoam> We can always count on Woolie to use the cool characters atleast zfiestBop
[1:25:17] <Carlioo> man ralf's sound effects are god tier
[1:25:18] <andre11dr> I don't know if Rock is actually canon in these games
[1:25:19] <gruulmagebeast> throws also beat meatys
[1:25:25] <IceyCone> Rock appeared in Terry's SNK Heroines ending, which is canon to KOF
[1:25:25] <dds333a> @thedream_c he's in '02
[1:25:30] <BaslerJones> i just noticed that this is a metal slug stage
[1:25:30] <+thedream_c> ah there it is
[1:25:33] <dds333a> I think that's his earliest
[1:25:53] <this_guy_115> 99 or 00 is when kid rock comes out
[1:26:12] <enerkaizer> I just wish they would give us a sequel to rocks story from the last Mark of the wolves game. They just don't do it because it would force them to age Mai up beyond her thirties
[1:26:15] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> @nintega010 I’m buying everything, my wallet crying
[1:26:16] <dds333a> '99, yep, yep
[1:26:27] <+cubbywolf> nice
[1:26:28] <dds333a> my b
[1:26:39] <jotabranded> you can oki with kiss flame after that
[1:26:42] <%RandoChris> Iori out here like a Yakuza boss fight
[1:26:43] <andre11dr> Wait so in the KOF universe does Terry just kidnap Rock from Geese? LUL
[1:26:46] <+cubbywolf> all according yo kakaku
[1:26:47] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @enerkaizer the world isn't ready for MILF Mai
[1:26:47] <nintega010> @J33P3R5_CR33P3R yeah to many good games came out at once
[1:26:47] <this_guy_115> love the fact that team Garou's theme is gonna be a remix of MOTW'S intro
[1:26:52] <+Ricky_Rexx> Damn son where'd you find this?
[1:26:54] <%DreamCancel01> who's playing?
[1:26:55] <brachydios777> I would honestly love to see older Mai
[1:27:03] <+kewlmyc> Woolie and REggie are playing
[1:27:05] <dds333a> @bonechamp4lyfe many would agree with you
[1:27:10] <enerkaizer> @AlteisenReiseZ To be fair, the ninjaboy was supposed to be Mais and Andys son originally
[1:27:16] <+thedream_c> older Mai just wears a dress like in the Garou Premium Pachinko :p
[1:27:18] <+Ricky_Rexx> @kewlmyc who's who?
[1:27:18] <Dakuu75> are they playing that  3 players, 3 characters team mode?
[1:27:19] <dds333a> @brachydios777 as in pink?
[1:27:20] <IceyCone> Rock never lived with Geese, he lived with his mom who died
[1:27:20] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @this_guy_115
[1:27:30] <+kewlmyc> Reggie is Player 2, Woolie Player 1
[1:27:31] <+bustawof> @this_guy_115 I freaked out when I heard it
[1:27:35] <+Ricky_Rexx> got it thx
[1:27:38] <brachydios777> pink?
[1:27:43] <IceyCone> So honestly Geese probably just doesn't care he ran off with Terry
[1:27:46] <andre11dr> I would love to see an old Kyo ,that motherfucker was still in highschool at like 25
[1:27:53] <dds333a> In FF 2, Mai wears pink
[1:27:54] <nintega010> Woolie don't got the loops so no one expect them
[1:28:03] <+kewlmyc> I just want K' and Kula to actually grow the fuck up
[1:28:05] <brachydios777> I mean age
[1:28:08] <this_guy_115> He dropped out of highschool after the NESTS saga actually
[1:28:11] <+BignanasTheGawd> Is that metal slug?
[1:28:11] <+bustawof> geese does not give a single fact basically
[1:28:16] <+bustawof> fuck
[1:28:22] <+thedream_c> KOFverse I think doesn't age as fast we think maybe
[1:28:24] <nintega010> super
[1:28:28] <%jinking79> he was dead
[1:28:28] <Dakuu75> I saw some Terry fan art just a minute ago with Terry wearing a shirt that says, "I'm not the step-dad, i'm the da who stepped up." lmao <3
[1:28:41] <Carlioo> does KOFverse age up at all?
[1:28:42] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> @nintega010 Dying Light 2, KOF15, Elden Ring, Horizon, Sifu, Pokémon, and other smaller stuff
[1:28:44] <dds333a> @brachydios777 LUL LUL
[1:29:03] <this_guy_115> @carlioo it is ONLY rock lol
[1:29:06] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> @carlioo I don’t think so, Angel is apparently still 19
[1:29:07] <IceyCone> Officially characters don't age except when they doo
[1:29:09] <Nerdwarp112> I think some characters have aged by a couple years but not much
[1:29:09] <enerkaizer> @Carlioo to a certain extent. Kyo I think was 18 in the first one, and he is now in his early 20ies (I think)
[1:29:12] <+thedream_c> or maybe the events of 14/15 kinda reset the timeline
[1:29:18] <+kewlmyc> @Carlioo Barely, unless your Rock Howard. I just assume there's a new KOF tournament every other month in universe.
[1:29:24] <shenran14> @Carlioo Kind of. Kyo is not on school anymore, so there's that.
[1:29:25] <brachydios777> How old is Kyo?
[1:29:28] <andre11dr> SF also has this problem, Chun is supposed to be 40 in SF3 but she looks the same
[1:29:45] <dds333a> Kyo's age still needs some calculating LUL
[1:29:47] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> Apparently a new god comes to get its ass beat every 3 weeks
[1:29:47] <%PeteRocca> YEAH KUKRI
[1:29:52] <Capn_Trips> Just hopped in, is this a metal slug stage?
[1:29:56] <this_guy_115> Yes
[1:29:58] <Somebodys_Frog> Yes
[1:29:59] <enerkaizer> @andre11dr She should be older, because her birtyear originall was 1963 if my memory doesn't betray me LOL
[1:30:02] <Capn_Trips> Dope
[1:30:11] <Nerdwarp112> I just assumed Rock was always DLC since he’d canonically a baby or something right now but you don’t have to worry about canon when it’s DLC
[1:30:14] <%jinking79> Mai been waiting 30 years for a Ring from Andy
[1:30:15] <IceyCone> The passage of time definitely happens but age is never actually said anymore for that reason
[1:30:20] <BaslerJones> anger barrel
[1:30:23] <this_guy_115> honestly no one ever ages, they just get different outfits
[1:30:27] <KaiserMario> Damn Woolie, you a fraud! LUL
[1:30:29] <this_guy_115> in kof, that is
[1:30:32] <+kewlmyc> KOFverse is basically Simpsons verse. Technology advances, but the characters don't
[1:30:39] <Man_in_the_Red> or they just grow a stupid beard
[1:30:43] <dds333a> Everybody is in limbo LUL
[1:31:11] <$ggbhtg> SCOOPED
[1:31:12] <andre11dr> Tung Fu has been 80 for 25 years LUL
[1:31:12] <brachydios777> Kyo with a beard though
[1:31:17] <dds333a> HAAGEN DASZ
[1:31:22] <IceyCone> For this game DLC is probably canon, considering they're releasing them with actual teams and stories
[1:31:24] <DSD24> Andy and Mai getting married
[1:31:29] <+kewlmyc> @brachydios777 So just his dad
[1:31:36] <brachydios777> yes
[1:31:51] <+Ricky_Rexx> shiny
[1:31:55] <%townzzzzz> SHINE
[1:32:08] <+Ricky_Rexx> It's so cool they made a whole fighting game based on that one smash character tbh
[1:32:08] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1493839904186503170?t=YO4iMpiXtS4ChklGkEnM1Q&s=19
[1:32:13] <xUrbanCarnage> Reggie nasty with the iori
[1:32:14] <$ggbhtg> Been a lot of talk of "How does Rock canonically make sense in KOF?" but isn't the answer "Becasue shut up?"
[1:32:22] <+kewlmyc> Always
[1:32:23] <gruulmagebeast> yeah meter is not a rare resource in this game
[1:32:30] <dds333a> The most Kyo has ever "aged" is when he vanished between '97 and '99, and then re appeared and burned the headband, putting the past behind him
[1:32:32] <zepelinnn1> think Vanessa should be woolz anchor for the moment
[1:32:35] <+Ricky_Rexx> I got the whole meter I'm gonna use the whole meter
[1:32:36] <DSD24> @ggbhtg I think the more positive response is 'Because he's cool!"
[1:32:40] <andre11dr> If Reggie get the Iori extension today, he wins the night
[1:32:45] <$ggbhtg> @DSD24 Correct
[1:32:49] <Haarute> reggie evolving like a pokemon
[1:32:52] <HotSauceFiend> is this one of the rare get into fighting games for glory episodes? haven't seen a new face on the couch in a while
[1:32:55] <%RandoChris> @ggbhtg "Because Maximilian won't stop bugging us!!"
[1:32:57] <skyshinecrusader> das boot
[1:32:58] <gruulmagebeast> hes learning as he fights
[1:33:00] <$ggbhtg> Because shut up, he's cool
[1:33:01] <IceyCone> He's been old since 2003 so I mean this isn't that new :p
[1:33:03] <enerkaizer> I wouldn't be shocked if they let kyo age a bit more after this game, if his ending in this is anything to go by
[1:33:04] <this_guy_115> @dds333a and it eas the coolest rendition of him ever, screw biker kyo
[1:33:04] <+Ricky_Rexx> Iori kind of got mad drip ngl
[1:33:15] <jotabranded> far D too good
[1:33:17] <+thedream_c> KOF always had drip
[1:33:23] <gruulmagebeast> will woolie remember his reversal
[1:33:25] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus so. i may have just bought kof cause after watching this i'm like. i need this too.
[1:33:29] <+kewlmyc> Hasn't Rock been ass in most of his games?
[1:33:29] <+MoonXBearX> well kyo aint in hs anymore thats about it
[1:33:37] <+thedream_c> Iori was the OG 90s edgelord who knew how to dress
[1:33:43] <dds333a> @iceycone yeah, and that was even earlier
[1:33:55] <fluke_LKZ> Except in CVS2 but only a bit, yes
[1:33:57] <DSD24> Iori also plays good music
[1:33:58] <fluke_LKZ> For Rock
[1:33:58] <andre11dr> @kewlmyc Yes ,trash in every one except 14
[1:34:04] <brachydios777> The ankle straps on Iori were weird
[1:34:11] <DSD24> I think Rock was eh in Garou but good in 14
[1:34:15] <fluke_LKZ> Yeah, he was pretty viable in 14
[1:34:15] <BlackermanZX> Sakurai loves the straps
[1:34:20] <+kewlmyc> @brachydios777 Needed to make sure his legs didn't get separated.
[1:34:20] <this_guy_115> Bo they weren't, they were limiters! (in my headcanon)
[1:34:21] <andre11dr> Rock is actually the worst caracter in Garou
[1:34:22] <+thedream_c> Iori from Million Arthur Arcana Blood
[1:34:23] <enerkaizer> I miss ioris OG outfit. To me he has always downgraded with every new outfit
[1:34:24] <dds333a> Rock is CRIMINAL, dude has issues
[1:34:25] <zepelinnn1> wish i could get this game, but no regional pricing NotLikeThis
[1:34:32] <stormhawk9891> Rock was just straight up BAD in Garou
[1:34:37] <odd_slater> Betty drip
[1:34:39] <DSD24> Shun Ei hype
[1:34:43] <DSD24> Lets gooo
[1:34:45] <$ggbhtg> I ain't hating on lore lords, seeing how SNK has often prioritized their storylines in Fatal Fury and KOF.
[1:34:48] <+thedream_c> Rock is winnable in Garou
[1:34:53] <+thedream_c> if you can play the system well
[1:34:56] <+kewlmyc> Shun Ei's moveset is cool. Shame he looks fucking stupid
[1:34:58] <$ggbhtg> more compared to other fighters
[1:34:58] <DopeyDragon> Isla has a weird fireball and I love it
[1:35:07] <this_guy_115> GO RAMON AND KOD, we need grapplers!
[1:35:08] <DSD24> @kewlmyc He looks like a dork
[1:35:08] <dds333a> Now Benimaru, is consistently top tier LUL
[1:35:09] <gruulmagebeast> yashiro is mad fun
[1:35:13] <enerkaizer> Shunei, for me, is both the most under- AND overdesigned Fighting game main chara I've ever seen
[1:35:15] <+the22cstomp> give krohnen some love
[1:35:22] <+thedream_c> Heidern carried over much of his 14 stuff
[1:35:25] <this_guy_115> Krohnen too yeah
[1:35:25] <%CaptainPileDriver> LET'S SEE ANTANOV
[1:35:26] <+kewlmyc> He has the most KOF wins for a reason.
[1:35:26] <DSD24> Heidern hype
[1:35:27] <IceyCone> Beni canonically has the most kof wins and I love that
[1:35:28] <+thedream_c> so he should be rock solid
[1:35:30] <gruulmagebeast> no krohnen stays in unga jail :)
[1:35:31] <nintega010> Who you play jimmybones

[1:35:58] <%AlteisenReiseZ> CLARK
[1:35:59] <gruulmagebeast> yo mah boi CLark
[1:36:00] <+Ricky_Rexx> Terrence? From Smash Brothers?
[1:36:01] <andre11dr> I use to think Ash was a dumb looking main character, and then i saw Shun and i became an Ash apologist
[1:36:01] <enerkaizer> Terry, the MAIN MAN
[1:36:02] <brachydios777> You bet Jurrasic!
[1:36:02] <+thedream_c> yeah I dunno bout point Yuri
[1:36:04] <+the22cstomp> ralf and clark are absurd
[1:36:05] <+bustawof> awww
[1:36:07] <gruulmagebeast> Clark is solid
[1:36:07] <Rojo_Hou> Yuri seems good. Akuma with a command grab.
[1:36:07] <IceyCone> Oh cool, he's got the garou outfit for terry
[1:36:08] <+kewlmyc> Everyone is pretty good in this game from what I've seen in streams
[1:36:08] <+thedream_c> yuri LOVES meter
[1:36:09] <xUrbanCarnage> DAS A GOOD TEAM REG
[1:36:12] <DSD24> Yuri looks better with long hair
[1:36:13] <%jinking79> ClarknT Pose to Victory
[1:36:13] <nintega010> Clark is grappler
[1:36:19] <0cash> If only this wasnt Elden Rings month, i'd buy this real quick
[1:36:21] <dds333a> you have to know what you're doing
[1:36:27] <+thedream_c> Yuri is another char who perpetually lives in the 90s
[1:36:28] <Nerdwarp112> It might just be because the graphics are significantly better, but Shun’Ei looks better to me in this game. I still wish he didn’t have the rolled-up pant leg, though.
[1:36:28] <dds333a> Clark takes involvement
[1:36:33] <DSD24> That's a cute Yuri color
[1:36:36] <+kewlmyc> Yeah, I had to choose between this and Elden Ring. Sorry KOF.
[1:36:38] <PFlare> I can't beat Clark. I have no clue how to approach him at all.
[1:36:39] <enerkaizer> This colour palette for heidern makes him 50 percent frog o_O
[1:36:39] <odd_slater> Banger
[1:36:40] <+bustawof> Terry is literally a semi truck in this game
[1:36:41] <dds333a> KONO
[1:36:46] <+thedream_c> hmmm I never thought of point Heidern
[1:36:51] <+thedream_c> but I gues syou can ply him for buttons
[1:37:00] <PFlare> He could literally just sit there and grapple all day, and I'd be clueless how to handle it.
[1:37:02] <xUrbanCarnage> @reggie you can command grab after ex punches and ex running grab after qcb punch
[1:37:08] <BlackermanZX> Shun'ei legit would look better ir he dropped the dumb tie and rolled up leg
[1:37:14] <AstrodropGaming> @Nerdwarp112 Shun'Ei would look WAY better if his colour scheme wasn't all over the damn place
[1:37:19] <DSD24> @BlackermanZX The headphones too
[1:37:23] <odd_slater> I'm glad this game has a jukebox function toi

[1:41:08] <PFlare> Oh. No.
[1:41:14] <+bustawof> no LUL
[1:41:14] <brachydios777> Don't drink the water in South Town
[1:41:14] <PFlare> He's just got a weird voice.
[1:41:15] <IceyCone> I mean he grew up on the streets
[1:41:16] <+applemon198> my gee is that lord jimmybones? ecellent!
[1:41:16] <dds333a> No, actually LUL
[1:41:17] <+Ricky_Rexx> Just thought with the way he speaks
[1:41:24] <DSD24> I think he's just very eccentric
[1:41:26] <PFlare> No, Terry's actually very intelligent.
[1:41:27] <dds333a> He may seem like it LUL
[1:41:28] <%RandoChris> Terry's American as fuck
[1:41:28] <this_guy_115> He's american
[1:41:29] <PFlare> He's just weird.
[1:41:31] <DopeyDragon> Wubba wubba, my mom dropped me on my head
[1:41:32] <+bustawof> Thats just good ol engrish
[1:41:37] <$ggbhtg> What a question
[1:41:37] <odd_slater> Terry is ESL
[1:41:48] <DSD24> @DopeyDragon Damn that made me laugh way too hard
[1:41:49] <+thedream_c> from the mean streets of Southtown
[1:41:55] <enerkaizer> @Ricky_Rexx considering I've met very smart people with worse english then Terrys, no. He probably just loves the way he can shout stuff this way
[1:42:03] <this_guy_115> succ
[1:42:04] <$ggbhtg> If they changed Terry's Engrish LITERALLY everybody would complain
[1:42:06] <+nanaki_ff14> yo have they seem the Mai vs Terry intro yet?
[1:42:06] <+thedream_c> cmd grab
[1:42:12] <gruulmagebeast> o7
[1:42:13] <+kewlmyc> Wait, does that heal hm?
[1:42:14] <xUrbanCarnage> Nooice
[1:42:17] <+thedream_c> yes it does
[1:42:19] <xUrbanCarnage> Yup
[1:42:20] <DopeyDragon> o7
[1:42:21] <this_guy_115> @kewlmyc yes
[1:42:21] <dds333a> @kewlmyc classic
[1:42:24] <+thedream_c> been that way for Heidern since
[1:42:24] <%GinAndRoses> o7
[1:42:30] <PFlare> Yeah, Terry's Engrish is a part of his character now. People would get pissed if he actually started speaking better.
[1:42:38] <brachydios777> Terry's Engrish is iconic
[1:42:42] <DSD24> I like this song
[1:42:47] <shenran14> They already change terry's voice,  on Maximum Impact, Right?
[1:42:50] <+kewlmyc> Never noticed that about Heidern
[1:42:55] <%RandoChris> At least if they took out his Engrish during gameplay
[1:42:59] <IceyCone> The dubbed him in maximum impact
[1:43:00] <+bustawof> Just like blue mary engrish is part of the charm
[1:43:07] <this_guy_115> I love that downward knee move Heidern does
[1:43:09] <enerkaizer> ... I sHeidern based on Broken Jr. from Kinnikuman? he moves a lot like him
[1:43:11] <dds333a> @bustawof ARE YOU LEADY
[1:43:15] <$ggbhtg> @shenran14 Yes, but Max Impact is bad. Bad for many reasons. LUL
[1:43:19] <+kewlmyc> And yeah, if Terry or Blue Mary stopped speaking Engrish, then it's time to riot.
[1:43:20] <gruulmagebeast> beef battle
[1:43:21] <+bustawof> yeyeye
[1:43:24] <+Ricky_Rexx> Oh thank god KOD is back on screen I'm happy again
[1:43:25] <+ManaCrevice> It's not "are you okay?" its "ARR YU OHKAY?"
[1:43:25] <+thedream_c> ohyeah blue mary is nice nice in this game too
[1:43:26] <DopeyDragon> @enerkaizer ye iirc
[1:43:27] <+bustawof> HEEEY
[1:43:39] <%RandoChris> DINOMANIA IS RUNNIN' WILD
[1:43:47] <this_guy_115> was kinnikuman before heidern?
[1:43:52] <gruulmagebeast> i wanna see clark throw super so bad
[1:43:53] <+Ricky_Rexx> Every second KOD isn't on screen everyone should be asking "Where is KOD?"
[1:43:53] <%RandoChris> Yeah
[1:43:56] <PFlare> Chipout!
[1:43:58] <dds333a> @this_guy_115 DEFINITELY
[1:43:58] <DopeyDragon> Kinnikuman was early 80s
[1:44:00] <IceyCone> Kinnikuman is pretty old, yes
[1:44:06] <DSD24> I kinda like Tizoc more then KOD
[1:44:11] <this_guy_115> Dang, I thought it was 90's
[1:44:14] <DSD24> I like the Bird Aesthetic
[1:44:27] <+thedream_c> sometimes heel personas are just more fun
[1:44:31] <+polothegreatest> 90s its his son iirc
[1:44:33] <pokaronn> Second Slash hits OTG
[1:44:34] <DopeyDragon> @this_guy_115 started 79
[1:44:35] <PFlare> So. This is the first KOF I've ever actually played?
[1:44:40] <xerotwo> CABROOOOOOOOON
[1:44:40] <this_guy_115> Use his ASSAULT RAPTOR MOVE
[1:44:42] <enerkaizer> Kinnikuman is the fighting shounen manga that invented many tropes, including friendship power up.
[1:44:50] <+LastHazzerd> Let's go TUROK
[1:44:55] <+thedream_c> if Zarina comes back in XV, we could see 'secret' bird team back
[1:44:56] <dds333a> LUL
[1:44:58] <PFlare> And the first character I started was Angel. Apparently she's literally the hardest character to learn in the series?
[1:45:00] <zepelinnn1> O K
[1:45:02] <+Ricky_Rexx> KOD is my favorite Extreme Dinosaur
[1:45:03] <this_guy_115> RAAAAAAAA he's powering up
[1:45:08] <%RandoChris> Good luck @PFlare lol
[1:45:10] <dds333a> @pflare one of
[1:45:12] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> @pflare Yup
[1:45:14] <DSD24> @PFlare Oh yeah Angle is tough
[1:45:15] <DopeyDragon> @pflare very high skill floor yeah
[1:45:15] <PFlare> So that's a nice curve I've set myself up for.
[1:45:27] <+thedream_c> Angel is tough because besides learning to 'play' KOF, u gotta learn how to play Angel too
[1:45:29] <gruulmagebeast> as far as games go this game is somewhat beginner friendly
[1:45:35] <PFlare> If I can get Angel down, then, it shouldn't be horrible to figure out other characters.
[1:45:39] <+thedream_c> so thats 2 layers of game knowledge you gotta get down
[1:45:39] <PFlare> DAMN
[1:45:41] <+Ricky_Rexx> OW
[1:45:42] <xerotwo> OOP AHH LUL
[1:45:44] <dds333a> Ángel is and especially was obscene
[1:45:45] <%RandoChris> That's a good way of lookin' at it @PFlare
[1:45:46] <xerotwo> EMOTIONAL DAMAGE
[1:45:46] <%slayabee> OOOS
[1:45:48] <Haarute> it's happening again
[1:45:49] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> @pflare Don’t you mean “nice curves”? Kappa
[1:45:50] <xerotwo> OOP AHH LUL
[1:45:53] <+MoonXBearX> if aris can get angel down so can you lol
[1:45:54] <+StooEsq> Ouch
[1:45:55] <+thedream_c> I mean, you still gotta learn how other chars work
[1:45:55] <brachydios777> LUL
[1:45:57] <xerotwo> OOP AHH! LUL
[1:45:58] <gruulmagebeast> woolie when is it my turn to use the ralf braincell? :)
[1:45:59] <xerotwo> EMOTIONAL DAMAGE
[1:46:02] <xUrbanCarnage> You can’t escape it
[1:46:03] <SomersaultJustice> LUL
[1:46:04] <AngryAsian5> LUL
[1:46:04] <+thedream_c> its just that Angel works DIFFERENTLY from other chars
[1:46:06] <AstrodropGaming> @PFlare If u learn how to play Angel, you'll be a menace
[1:46:10] <xUrbanCarnage> UNBLOCKABLE or not
[1:46:10] <zepelinnn1> YOU CANT ESCAPE
[1:46:10] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:46:10] <nintega010> lol
[1:46:17] <BlackermanZX> You're gonna carry that weight
[1:46:17] <%Drakedavar> Drakedavar subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[1:46:19] <$ggbhtg> eMOtional DAmage
[1:46:21] <PFlare> @AstrodropGaming That's the hope.
[1:46:22] <enerkaizer> wasn't Ângel made easier to use in the last and this game? I remember people saying her inputs were made easier to do
[1:46:24] <+thedream_c> like yuri is cracked Sakura with demon flips
[1:46:32] <xUrbanCarnage> Hold the pain of the punch
[1:46:35] <this_guy_115> Angel was the firsr KoF character with chain inputs
[1:46:35] <%RandoChris> No one's hit a Level 3 yet, have they?
[1:46:38] <AstrodropGaming> @PFlare Good luck dood LUL
[1:46:39] <gruulmagebeast> woolie heidern lookin clean
[1:46:39] <dds333a> @enerkaizer yes
[1:46:42] <$razielhex> heindern's legs are taller than Yuri
[1:46:43] <BlackermanZX> Just dodge it Reggie woolieFROG
[1:46:57] <PFlare> Also, I'm open for sparring or whatever you wanna call it if anyone's interested.
[1:46:59] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> @enerkaizer Her inputs are easier but she is still entirely reliant on her unchain combo.
[1:47:11] <+thedream_c> Nelson sorta had a similar style like Angel but he wasn't chain based
[1:47:17] <+thedream_c> Nelson from 14 i mean
[1:47:18] <dds333a> She still has the chained circle shit yeah
[1:47:22] <+kewlmyc> Finger bang
[1:47:23] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> Which mean you got memorize that stuff to do *anything* with her
[1:47:26] <jotabranded> Yuri's flip demon is really good in this game btw
[1:47:26] <Afrosamasenpai> bang bang bang
[1:47:27] <IceyCone> I miss Nelson, he was cool
[1:47:34] <nintega010> @thedream_c I miss Nelson
[1:47:42] <+HarmonicArsenal> why is there a dinosaur in this game?
[1:47:42] <%RandoChris> You ain't the only one
[1:47:44] <+thedream_c> i dunno i don't miss him
[1:47:46] <DSD24> Nelson was the boxer with the robo arm right?
[1:47:48] <PFlare> @HarmonicArsenal Why not?
[1:47:48] <%livlinn> kyoryuFingerguns

[2:04:06] <DSD24> Isn't Chizuru a huge motocycle fan
[2:04:08] <+Teach_W> This man really said "Vergil" and "balanced" in the same breath
[2:04:16] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> My character choices are based on “are they hot”

[2:08:12] <this_guy_115> Dolores is weird to me because of story reasons

[2:09:51] <+kewlmyc> Does sound like a TWEWY song
[2:09:52] <pixel_river> i tohught it was islas LUL
[2:10:00] <this_guy_115> Its time for revolution, ITS OUR GENERATION
[2:10:04] <PFlare> It's 100% Isla's.
[2:10:04] <DSD24> Yeah Dolores has a cool vest in the story mode cutscenes
[2:10:05] <+elderpunch> @odd_slater true lol
[2:10:05] <BlackermanZX> its TWEWY as hell for sure LUL
[2:10:07] <+Bitscreed> Oh yeah, this is crazily TWEWY. I love it.
[2:10:10] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> @pixel_river Well it’s Isla’s team
[2:10:12] <gruulmagebeast> now this is a handsome looking match
[2:10:12] <+LastHazzerd> gee i wonder who this song is for
[2:10:12] <AstrodropGaming> KoF should NEVER leave the 1990's aesthetic
[2:10:13] <+the22cstomp> @IceyCone he's hip with it
[2:10:13] <IceyCone> Isla, Heidern and Dolores are on the same team
[2:10:19] <+kewlmyc> @pixel_river It is. It's the Rival Team theme, which is Isla/Dolores/Heidern. They share it
[2:10:26] <gruulmagebeast> big brain
[2:10:30] <+0neReeler> what happened to the unblockable
[2:10:39] <dds333a> @astrodropgaming a bit late in some respects LUL
[2:10:39] <pixel_river> ah ok so kof is team themes
[2:10:43] <DSD24> Start moonwalking Chris
[2:10:45] <%RandoChris> Though you could say it's Isla's considering it's heavily influenced by her compared to Heidern and Dolores
[2:10:49] <this_guy_115> Can you believe Isla is cooler than Shun? because she IS.
[2:10:52] <brachydios777> Orochi colors?
[2:10:53] <BlackermanZX> Didn't pick the Bart Simpson colors for Chris 2/10
[2:10:56] <+LastHazzerd> so i hear Ralf is good
[2:10:57] <dds333a> @pixel_river for the most part, but there are PLENTY of individual themes
[2:11:01] <inorwise> "ok here we go"
[2:11:02] <PFlare> Isla is absolutely cooler than Shun.
[2:11:09] <+kewlmyc> @this_guy_115 You act as if that's hard to do or something
[2:11:12] <+Fetrigon> ye give em the work jimmy majinoCaba majinoCaba
[2:11:14] <+0neReeler> anyone is cooler than shunei
[2:11:15] <gruulmagebeast> ralf is a good anchor for a reason
[2:11:16] <DopeyDragon> @pixel_river a handful of characters have individual themes and some characters have "destined battle themes"
[2:11:16] <JdotSweapA> KOF yeah!
[2:11:20] <this_guy_115> Kappa
[2:11:30] <odd_slater> The D
[2:11:34] <+Fetrigon> majinoCaba WOOOO

[2:11:50] <%jinking79> damn the come back
[2:11:56] <dds333a> YAY
[2:12:05] <xUrbanCarnage> The reverse OCV
[2:12:11] <brachydios777> That white on Chris is an Orochi reference, right?
[2:12:32] <+TungstenoViperante> Color Paletted Edit DLC when?
[2:12:32] <gruulmagebeast> shun'ei is weird to me cause hes  a character designed to appeal to younger/newer players even though most people who play this are fans who are 20 minimum
[2:12:33] <JdotSweapA> is that LJB!?
[2:12:45] <primaryfire> snk got the bayonetta 4 design early
[2:12:52] <dds333a> and the vest

[2:13:42] <odd_slater> LUL
[2:13:53] <%GinAndRoses> slap slap slap
[2:13:55] <this_guy_115> K9's theme is the actual BEST, I can't believe they managed to make a theme as good as Ruler of the Dark
[2:13:59] <+kewlmyc> Krohnen's theme is so good SourPls
[2:13:59] <%jinking79> game got like 4 parents in the game with a 5th in dlc
[2:14:02] <brachydios777> Kid got hands
[2:14:03] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> Everyone has at least one person in the roster where they wouldn’t mind being their chair
[2:14:08] <dds333a> I don't like how that super looks these days, however
[2:14:12] <gruulmagebeast> chris about to show you he like your cut g with that super
[2:14:22] <dds333a> Same goes for Chizuru
[2:14:41] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> They just might pick Chang LUL
[2:14:41] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:15:01] <+kewlmyc> Chizuru does lose some of her coolness in 3D, I admit
[2:15:11] <gruulmagebeast> shes still solid though
[2:15:22] <dds333a> @gruulmagebeast absolutely
[2:15:23] <BlackermanZX> Betty lookin real fine
[2:15:41] <+kewlmyc> Sucks they took the horsewhip though
[2:15:42] <gruulmagebeast> is betty from like another snk game?
[2:15:52] <+0neReeler> kof xi
[2:15:53] <%RandoChris> Nah, she's original to KOF
[2:15:54] <dds333a> Nope
[2:16:02] <this_guy_115> Betty's from the Ash arc
[2:16:02] <xUrbanCarnage> @woolieversus cancel normals into qcback sway to reset to neutral on block
[2:16:11] <+kewlmyc> @gruulmagebeast She's Ash's childhood friend
[2:16:14] <dds333a> @kewlmyc riding crop gone LUL
[2:16:18] <gruulmagebeast> shes like maxima to me where she looks like she from a whole nother franchise
[2:16:30] <this_guy_115> She's Ash's rival (but to be fair Ash had a lot of rivals, EVERYONE wanted him dead by 13 lol)
[2:16:32] <KingSpunf> As someone who only plays Skullgirls, WOW This game is UUUG-LY!
[2:16:33] <brachydios777> Isla and Dolores are original
[2:16:39] <dds333a> Well, Maxima is BASED on a dude from another game, at least LUL
[2:16:48] <this_guy_115> Same as K'
[2:16:51] <JdotSweapA> chris is pluss on that? yeah!
[2:16:58] <%Shad0wTag> Shen should be here man

[2:17:07] <+Fetrigon> majinoCaba  ye, jimmy give em that work
[2:17:10] <BlackermanZX> I hope for Shen too
[2:17:22] <SrHassan> @kingspunf edaniiIguessss
[2:17:23] <+zanz_san> Chris was suppose to the original boss of KoF 94 and looked like Akira
[2:17:26] <+Ultimate_Edge> That dam Chris jump is just reliving the nightmare of 2002 Chris
[2:17:29] <gruulmagebeast> im just waiting till we get yamazaki
[2:17:31] <+AWKWARDL0SER> SNK is gonna do Delores like Vanessa post VF4
[2:17:41] <odd_slater> lol
[2:17:50] <BlackermanZX> at least they showed Duo Lon with an invitaion card in one of the endings
[2:17:51] <+Fetrigon> the neverending flex majinoNeko
[2:18:00] <BlackermanZX> So Duo might be DLLC
[2:18:10] <$doombawkz> I mean reflecting on yourself is cool and all, but have you ever tried blaming the beasts?
[2:18:26] <dds333a> Ideally Duo wont be as BROKEN as he was in XIII
[2:18:36] <+kewlmyc> Who would be the 3rd on a team of Duo Lon and Shen though? Oswald?
[2:18:37] <%RandoChris> I hate that I read "breasts" instead of "beasts" @doombawkz lol
[2:18:37] <+Ultimate_Edge> Well according to the so far credible leaks, no Duo anytime soon
[2:18:44] <$doombawkz> lol
[2:18:57] <this_guy_115> yep sadly
[2:18:58] <JdotSweapA> praying for Oswald again. didnt get to try him in 14
[2:19:03] <+zanz_san> jabs best short hops
[2:19:04] <BlackermanZX> Duo Shen and Oswald would be sick
[2:19:15] <gruulmagebeast> i wonder if theyll add the chibi girl version of te big dude with the wrecking ball from the mobile game
[2:19:19] <dds333a> the classic kof short hop approach, necessary
[2:19:22] <+Fetrigon> ah I see how smash bros was inspired by this
[2:19:26] <this_guy_115> Female Chang?
[2:19:33] <gruulmagebeast> yeah thatd be a funny addition
[2:19:35] <dds333a> @gruulmagebeast no, just normal Chang LUL
[2:19:38] <+0neReeler> joke terry
[2:19:44] <+kewlmyc> Getting Lady Chang instead of actual Chang would be hilarious
[2:19:55] <+zanz_san> standing D hurts
[2:20:18] <this_guy_115> Lady chang is just such a good design

[2:21:24] <dds333a> Kriz is MY  FAVORITE kof boss
[2:21:24] <this_guy_115> because he was one of the ones REVIVED
[2:21:44] <%Shad0wTag> But he should keep the coat on

[2:22:44] <dds333a> LUL LUL
[2:22:49] <%Shad0wTag> Yes I do
[2:22:56] <this_guy_115> @dds333a that was actually not the real krizalid
[2:23:03] <+0neReeler> one of the bosses (reverse?) can bring people back or something so orochi characters revived
[2:23:05] <artificiallynatural> @gruulmagebeast verse, boss from 14, revived everyone when he died
[2:23:12] <SrHassan> final boss from last game had the souls of a lot of dead characters, killing him revived em @gruulmagebeast
[2:23:20] <gruulmagebeast> howd they die
[2:23:32] <@Menitta> Aight how they liking it?
[2:23:33] <dds333a> @this_guy_115 I'd wager that it was, since Ron was on the team, and he has the ability to resurrect the dead
[2:23:39] <gruulmagebeast> all the orochi people that is?
[2:23:44] <+0neReeler> orochi saga killed or sacrificed
[2:23:47] <dds333a> I doubt it was just another imperfect clone of Krizalid
[2:24:00] <this_guy_115> Shermie and yashiro killed themselves to make chris turn into orochi in 97
[2:24:03] <@Menitta> Elizabeth is so cool
[2:24:13] <dds333a> @gruulmagebeast they all died in myriad ways LUL
[2:24:15] <JohnXuandou> use the run super instead of Galactica Phantom
[2:24:18] <this_guy_115> chris died when sacred treasures killed orochi in 97 also
[2:24:25] <+0neReeler> iori killed his teammates
[2:24:28] <JdotSweapA> didnt Ash blip himself out of existence too? oh well LUL
[2:24:34] <dds333a> @this_guy_115 sealed, but yeah

[2:31:53] <%Juriasu> SourPls

[2:32:12] <this_guy_115> Sourpls
[2:32:20] <JohnXuandou> the lag version
[2:32:23] <xerotwo> Has there been any input delay offline?
[2:32:27] <JdotSweapA> i no its not crossplat but is it crossplay with ps4?
[2:32:30] <$ggbhtg> PS4 version on PS5, tho
[2:32:42] <JdotSweapA> oh gocha
[2:32:49] <this_guy_115> Love Orochi team's theme, WAY more than 2002 UM's remix
[2:32:49] <BlackermanZX> is this not the pc version?
[2:32:53] <xerotwo> interesting
[2:32:56] <+LastHazzerd> @BlackermanZX no
[2:33:07] <%AlteisenReiseZ> RIP i'm on pc
[2:33:17] <BlackermanZX> PC has WAAAAY less input delay
[2:33:25] <JdotSweapA> playin pc while watchin LUL
[2:33:30] <BlackermanZX> currently PC is the best
[2:33:31] <+LastHazzerd> what engine is this game in?
[2:33:33] <+LastHazzerd> Unreal?
[2:33:36] <dds333a> I don't think they plan on getting matches against players in
[2:33:43] <JdotSweapA> looks like unreal
[2:33:47] <xerotwo> UE4 iirc
[2:33:50] <JohnXuandou> KOD cr.A is a super ridiculous poke
[2:33:51] <xerotwo> same as Strive
[2:33:56] <dds333a> Woolz mentioned something like that, at least, not sure
[2:34:19] <%Irridium> would be cool to get a few party mode matches in
[2:34:23] <+kewlmyc> Yeah PS5 UE4 Fighters seem to have a shitton more input lag compared to the other versions
[2:34:34] <+kewlmyc> Which sucks since Playstation owns Evo now
[2:34:35] <dds333a> Nice trade Kappa
[2:34:52] <xerotwo> Party mode matches with the trio PogChamp
[2:34:53] <%Irridium> @kewlmyc probably the higher resolution, I'd bet.
[2:35:03] <Josef_Stryker> Man that kick is really good
[2:35:24] <+kewlmyc> @Irridium Naw, since PC and XSX don't have this issue with this game
[2:35:46] <+0neReeler> dinosaur have any armor buttons?
[2:35:48] <JohnXuandou> KOD cr.A, far C, far D, and CD are all incredible normals
[2:36:10] <%Irridium> @kewlmyc I didn't even know the game was out on series x lmao
[2:36:10] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:36:18] <+cmac92> @kewlmyc  Pc has screen tearing issues
[2:36:43] <%Shad0wTag> Sam Sho was on xbox  too
[2:36:46] <+kewlmyc> True but we were talking about input lag, not just general issues
[2:36:47] <JdotSweapA> @cmac92 fixes itself if you add it to nvidia control panel
[2:36:49] <dweebenheimer20> @cmac92 they can be fixed with settings, depending on the PC
[2:36:57] <+kewlmyc> And it depends on your PC build
[2:37:37] <+cmac92> @jdotsweapa What settings do you have to change?
[2:37:42] <teg88> I just noticed that Tizoc is muffled under the mask and that's great.
[2:37:54] <JdotSweapA> true. no idea how to fix it for non nvidia users. besides turning vsynch on
[2:38:05] <JdotSweapA> but i heard that adds a frame of input delay so iuno
[2:38:06] <+kewlmyc> His name is King of Dinosaurs. Who the fuck is Tizoc.
[2:38:16] <PKSomething> Ooooh is this a For Glory?
[2:38:32] <dds333a> @pksomething probably not LUL
[2:38:33] <JdotSweapA> @cmac92 once you add it to your programs. turn Vsynch on. then restart . that should fix it
[2:38:35] <Hessman212> @kewlmyc if you know you know
[2:38:35] <+kewlmyc> F
[2:38:36] <nintega010> @kewlmyc people keep mixing them up
[2:38:38] <dds333a> But it's getting there
[2:38:45] <PKSomething> I saw a third person and assumed they were an expert
[2:38:50] <%RandoChris> gregchunCRY
[2:38:55] <JohnXuandou> Jimmy is pretty skilled at KoF
[2:38:57] <BlackermanZX> Tizoc? we only talk bout the KOD here kolWESCI
[2:39:03] <WeepyDevil> @dds333a it is, lol
[2:39:07] <+cmac92> @jdotsweapa there's a way to turn off v sync in game? the option is not there
[2:39:09] <+0neReeler> betty D is nice looking like kyo's
[2:39:14] <xerotwo> Party mode?
[2:39:21] <dds333a> @hessman212 pretty sure he does know LUL
[2:40:09] <+GamerTowerDX> Are you winning son?
[2:40:12] <dds333a> LUL LUL LUL
[2:40:14] <+0neReeler> true
[2:40:17] <xerotwo> OOP AHH LUL
[2:40:21] <dds333a> Based
[2:40:25] <BlackermanZX> Its the Strive issue all over again
[2:40:25] <+FoxLex_> MK11 runs better on PS5, Jimmy
[2:40:25] <cartakus> WOW
[2:40:30] <+0neReeler> also disabling ps4 sticks on ps5 ver
[2:40:34] <+kewlmyc> Dude, I assume the playerbase for this game on Xbox is already dead
[2:40:46] <flychosis> woolieEVIL
[2:40:48] <kulmoth> Sorry pc is now king (always has been)
[2:41:00] <odd_slater> @foxlex_ Happy for MK11 players :)
[2:41:04] <dds333a> LUL
[2:41:04] <JohnXuandou> yeah the issue is that most FG players don't buy Xbox lol
[2:41:12] <Hessman212> PC is best. Xbox has what, Tekken for fighting games
[2:41:13] <+kewlmyc> PC seems to be the best bet for Japanese fighting games nowadays
[2:41:18] <+0neReeler> steamdeck universal standard
[2:41:35] <dds333a> LUL LUL
[2:41:43] <BlackermanZX> Have ya tried Isla
[2:41:56] <%jinking79> waiting on Yamazaki  to complete my Terry Iori  team
[2:42:03] <odd_slater> I wanna say Xbox has Tekken,KOF,SamSho,Melty, and KI through backwards compatibility
[2:42:09] <odd_slater> And NRS
[2:42:20] <+kewlmyc> If I was playing, I would go K/Kula/Krohnen for team gloves
[2:42:20] <xerotwo> LUL
[2:42:24] <thomasvalentine31> Dreamcast was a beautiful system, and it was an absolute sin that it didn't last longer than it did. Some great games and KOF on it were fantastic.
[2:42:27] <%JetpackMcQuack> this game has some good looking sand
[2:42:28] <xerotwo> TRYHARD GAMER BOI
[2:42:29] <dds333a> here we go
[2:42:30] <BlackermanZX> LUL
[2:42:40] <JdotSweapA> boo Shun'Ei. teach that kid how to wear clothes
[2:42:41] <shenran14> Reggie a shun'ei main? Let's go!
[2:42:41] <DSD24> What about sleepy boy
[2:42:45] <Josef_Stryker> Man Woolie REALLY hates Shun'ei LUL
[2:42:45] <+cmac92> I hate PC but it's gonna be the standard in the future unless these consoles get their shit together
[2:42:45] <+kewlmyc> Sleepy boi fucking hits like a truck
[2:42:46] <UnrealStyrofoam> Reggie always picking lames
[2:42:48] <dds333a> Shun'ei ain't new Kappa
[2:42:54] <+RustyCoyoteA> Isla aka Better Shunei
[2:42:56] <%jinking79> dood got No Drip and No Ass
[2:42:58] <%Shad0wTag> God if the fgc transitoned back to xbox for consoles again, that would make me so happy
[2:43:00] <Qsmash_> Is Rock Howard not Chuuni?
[2:43:01] <Hessman212> Shun'Ei has a gross design but is fun and easy
[2:43:02] <+0neReeler> rock invalidating shunie
[2:43:03] <BlackermanZX> fuck no narcolepsy kid still has a whack costume
[2:43:04] <+absolutenc> let's go shun'ei <3
[2:43:09] <xerotwo> good thing Isla is the BETTER Protag Kappa
[2:43:11] <roboyuji> My KoF team is pretty much always Terry/Yuri/Athena
[2:43:11] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:43:15] <Mattais88> Geese is so fucking cool
[2:43:16] <JdotSweapA> Kukri Squad
[2:43:17] <maubpp> woolie boutta get clapped by online shun'eis
[2:43:20] <+kewlmyc> Yeah, Shunei's moveset is cool. Dude just looks fucking stupid
[2:43:22] <DSD24> Sleepy boy has pigtails its weird
[2:43:24] <dds333a> Meitenkun is actually great
[2:43:28] <Qsmash_> ...
[2:43:29] <+kewlmyc> BOOOOOOOOO
[2:43:30] <xerotwo> LUL
[2:43:34] <$ggbhtg> -2
[2:43:34] <xerotwo> GET OUTTA HERE LUL
[2:43:39] <Josef_Stryker> Sometimes it feels like Rock gets a pass on the basis that he came first.
[2:43:43] <DSD24> I liked your pun
[2:43:44] <JohnXuandou> Clark is a monster
[2:43:54] <JdotSweapA> he terrifying
[2:43:57] <Josef_Stryker> I wonder how he would've been received if he was revealed nowadays
[2:44:09] <dds333a> @josef_stryker a lot of people didn't jive with him then either
[2:44:09] <%Demoli_PT> @WoolieVersus i'm playing terry clarke robert
[2:44:11] <6PoundsofShrimp> Is this game actually dope?
[2:44:12] <roboyuji> Sleepy kid looks like Komugi from Hunter X Hunter lol
[2:44:15] <%Demoli_PT> but i am complete garbage
[2:44:17] <+kewlmyc> Rock also doesn't look stupid. People would be cool with Shunei if not for his design
[2:44:22] <JohnXuandou> Clark is like easily top 10 bare minimum, more likely top 5
[2:44:38] <Qsmash_> well 95
[2:44:42] <mister_z_1994> If 94 had singular characters that is
[2:44:42] <Somebodys_Frog> I didnt expect to like Isla as much but shes in my team for now
[2:44:49] <+LastHazzerd> i was gonna say, did 94 have team customization?
[2:44:49] <%RandoChris> I'm rolling with Terry and Yashiro, just dunno who to make third.
[2:44:49] <%jinking79> god i hope Yamazaki has the knife this game
[2:44:55] <+LastHazzerd> but the chars were there
[2:45:01] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> Half of my demands have been met, the stream is almost a smash shit
[2:45:05] <+experimilk> gato and o chris with ex moves, gonna be sick
[2:45:08] <DSD24> Those colors are way better
[2:45:10] <+kewlmyc> The Shunei salt from Woolie will never not be funny
[2:45:12] <dds333a> Yeah, since in '94, it was just countries LUL
[2:45:13] <+LastHazzerd> still looks like a flight school drop out
[2:45:19] <Josef_Stryker> I mean Rock SCREAMS "OC Do Not Steal": bastard child of the main villain, father figure in the main hero and sporting the fighting style of both. Not to mention the edgy wings
[2:45:21] <shenran14> His purple color is really good.
[2:45:27] <AstrodropGaming> Shun'Ei in this alt colour scheme makes sense
[2:45:37] <artificiallynatural> 15 might be the end of the shun ei saga at least
[2:45:38] <+the22cstomp> woolie just isnt hip with it
[2:45:40] <inorwise> but woolie you LOVE the torch pass Kappa
[2:45:42] <JohnXuandou> Woolie doing to Shun'Ei what everyone else did with Ash when Ash was the new hero
[2:45:45] <%TheQuadrupleS> LUL
[2:45:49] <+Teach_W> I'd lighten up on him if he had any design cohesion but we're not gonna get that now are we
[2:45:57] <SaiyanShoto> They passed the torch when no one was asking for the torch to be passed
[2:45:57] <WeepyDevil> @Josef_Stryker the wings are on addition to a nice simple, well coordianted look though
[2:45:58] <+LastHazzerd> the times, woolie
[2:46:02] <DSD24> No?
[2:46:09] <mister_z_1994> Yes he was
[2:46:09] <%RandoChris> Maybe with the next game considering his ending @Teach_W
[2:46:11] <+conqab> shun'ei is cringe af, especially standing next to every other kof character
[2:46:11] <+kewlmyc> Didn't people not like K' back in 99 as well? People just hate the new heroes every new saga
[2:46:12] <DSD24> Rashid was cool
[2:46:14] <Josef_Stryker> @WeepyDevil Oh no Rock looks sick don't get me wrong.
[2:46:15] <dds333a> @johnxuandou and they kinda still do
[2:46:15] <JdotSweapA> remember when Alex was the main character of 3?
[2:46:19] <%TheQuadrupleS> Elizabeth was the protag before Shun'ei right?
[2:46:25] <maubpp> ok but listen, Rashid's dope tho
[2:46:26] <+LastHazzerd> what? Rashid was supposed to be the main guy?
[2:46:28] <BlackermanZX> it was literally the same with K' and Ash
[2:46:28] <%Demoli_PT> ashe was i think
[2:46:29] <JohnXuandou> no Ash was the protagonist
[2:46:30] <+kewlmyc> @TheQuadrupleS Ash was
[2:46:31] <%DashXero> Alex was the only non-Ryu that got properly pushed.
[2:46:31] <+alphatwo> @TheQuadrupleS Ash was
[2:46:36] <Josef_Stryker> But he feels like a character that was destined to be scorned but somehow is a fan fave
[2:46:39] <+the22cstomp> yeah, k' and ash got the same hate
[2:46:41] <%TheQuadrupleS> Ah thnx
[2:46:44] <%DashXero> And no one liked it.
[2:46:46] <mister_z_1994> @LastHazzerd The answer is yes and no
[2:46:46] <dds333a> @saiyanshoto but it's expected, it's kof
[2:46:48] <streamingafterdark> Yeah Alex worked
[2:46:49] <%Demoli_PT> @WoolieVersus rashid was not meant to be the sf5 protag, necali was
[2:46:50] <IceyCone> K' and Ash got hate absolutely
[2:46:52] <LaserRamon> Ash got crazy hate
[2:46:56] <xUrbanCarnage> Alex was on the cover of 2nd impact
[2:47:01] <+LastHazzerd> @mister_z_1994 His involvement in the plot was tangential at best tho
[2:47:01] <+Teach_W> @RandoChris He's just so over-designed. I hope they tone it down a bit going forward for sure.
[2:47:01] <DSD24> But didn't Necali get jobbed
[2:47:01] <BlackermanZX> I forget Necalli even exists
[2:47:04] <xUrbanCarnage> With his rival
[2:47:05] <Qsmash_> some people still hate Ash
[2:47:06] <xUrbanCarnage> HUGO
[2:47:12] <+kewlmyc> Necalli fucking sucks ass
[2:47:15] <%jinking79> man in March 15 Luke and Kyo r gonna clash in all stars LUL
[2:47:18] <thomasvalentine31> I did dig how Alex was given a Red Headband in order for Capcom to signal "hey, new main character here"
[2:47:19] <%Demoli_PT> yeah by the time story mode released they realised necalli was garbage
[2:47:20] <%Shad0wTag> Necali was an antag not a protag
[2:47:34] <Exeerdna> Ash got hate until people realized he was fucking good
[2:47:34] <+kewlmyc> I know, but I like shitting on Necalli regardless
[2:47:37] <dds333a> @artificiallynatural he most likely has one more game In his tenure
[2:47:39] <Josef_Stryker> I wonder if they'll try to bring Necalli back or if SFV will be his only game
[2:47:44] <shenran14> My man Necalli was supposed to be main villain for sfv and was squashed in one fight.
[2:47:52] <DSD24> Didn't Necalli have V on his face
[2:47:53] <%Demoli_PT> necalli was absolute pushed as THE sf5 character on pre release stuff
[2:47:57] <%RandoChris> I know in XIV they gave Shun'ei a traditional kung fu costume
[2:47:58] <IceyCone> every kof main character gets 3
[2:47:59] <+Teach_W> @Josef_Stryker I'd rather not him job in future titles too
[2:48:10] <skagtheprinceofhell> @shenran14 Multiple fights
[2:48:10] <%mighty_max_t> mighty_max_t subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months! Feeling good that KOF is making me excited again. King's air fireballs, the Kula snowman drop, the overall game flow, heck even the non-gameplay stuff like the DJ Station. Hope you're all enjoying it too!
[2:48:13] <%Demoli_PT> like @DSD24 said, he even had the V incorporated into his design
[2:48:15] <+absolutenc> shun'ei time! coxHypers
[2:48:19] <+kewlmyc> If Luke, Menat, and Rashid were the only SFV newcomes to come back, I'd be cool with that. Less of Luke, but he's already confirmed
[2:48:24] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> Why do the coolest characters always job?
[2:48:30] <%Shad0wTag> Marc Swint VA work made Necali even cooler
[2:48:31] <Hessman212> @RandoChris It doesn't look much better
[2:48:42] <Josef_Stryker> Still made at how dirty they did Nash in SFV's story
[2:48:44] <DSD24> More Menat please she's awesome, hard to play though
[2:48:51] <%RandoChris> Not saying it did, just noting
[2:48:51] <Josef_Stryker> Should've at least did a tag team with Ryu and THEN die again
[2:49:13] <shenran14> @skagtheprinceofhell You may be right. Don't remember much of necalli outside of his Ryu fight.
[2:49:28] <DSD24> "You don't really mean that"
[2:49:29] <dds333a> LUL
[2:49:32] <thomasvalentine31> I dig Shun'El design simply because I'm a sucker for the whole "Coat as a cape" trope as it  looks hella cool.
[2:49:47] <nintega010> @thomasvalentine31 same
[2:49:52] <+kewlmyc> Necalli's problem is that he was written to eat anyone he beats in a fight, so in the story mode, that meant he had to lose every fight
[2:49:53] <%Irridium> reggie just loves that woolie hates it
[2:49:57] <%RandoChris> I'm making up the headcanon that Shun'ei's outfit is hand-me-downs of Terry and Andy that Tung gave them when they were growing up with him.
[2:49:57] <%TheQuadrupleS> LUL
[2:49:57] <thomasvalentine31> Also, Shun'El gets STAND HANDS
[2:50:07] <IceyCone> They changed almost all the voice actors in XIV
[2:50:09] <dds333a> The one he had for decades
[2:50:11] <IceyCone> cause old
[2:50:11] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:50:13] <JohnXuandou> Ralf is angry now
[2:50:14] <Josef_Stryker> Shun'ei's fine imo his design is just a bit too busy tho
[2:50:17] <+theDesender> how;'s online for this
[2:50:17] <dds333a> YAY
[2:50:18] <nintega010> I honestly like this one more
[2:50:18] <+polothegreatest> Monday is capcom thing plaguePog
[2:50:23] <Josef_Stryker> Like they tried way too hard on him when less would've worked better

[2:50:35] <%jinking79> King still the same Voice since 94
[2:50:35] <dds333a> They changed it in XIV
[2:50:39] <%AlteisenReiseZ> The only person who's stayed as their character all this time is King. 20+ Years!
[2:50:39] <DedlokPM> DedlokPM subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 39 months! ARE YOU OK? BUSTA WOLF
[2:50:42] <DSD24> Hasn't King had the same VA since she first was released?
[2:50:44] <Qsmash_> I mean King still has her same voice so mabye its circumstantial
[2:50:46] <skagtheprinceofhell> @Hessman212 Battle aura
[2:50:47] <+laserchainsaws> How’s Totally not Kaneda
[2:50:47] <DSD24> Oh cool someone already mentioned it
[2:50:48] <WeepyDevil> i mean, eventually your voice changes
[2:50:54] <+kewlmyc> A lot of voice actors got changed. The franchise is like 30 years old. The VAs retired or fucking straight up died over the years.
[2:50:57] <%AlteisenReiseZ> They have
[2:50:58] <%RandoChris> Benimaru's VA is still the same
[2:51:00] <+kewlmyc> They have
[2:51:00] <JohnXuandou> they DID change Terry lmao
[2:51:01] <+LastHazzerd> did they not?
[2:51:05] <IceyCone> They did change Terry
[2:51:06] <dds333a> they have
[2:51:07] <Qsmash_> they did change terry's voice
[2:51:07] <+the22cstomp> yes
[2:51:07] <+polothegreatest> Dang goku plagueSad
[2:51:07] <mister_z_1994> Oh no, they'd never do that. *sweats nervously*
[2:51:07] <WeepyDevil> unless you start doing the voice while you're already old
[2:51:08] <%jinking79> YES
[2:51:09] <%RandoChris> They did change him
[2:51:11] <Hessman212> They all got new voice actors
[2:51:15] <thomasvalentine31> Isn't Goku's JP va like in her flipping 80's or something?
[2:51:15] <JohnXuandou> Terry and Faust have the same VA now
[2:51:17] <BlackermanZX> fake fan Keepo
[2:51:20] <%DashXero> LUL
[2:51:21] <%townzzzzz> perfect english terry
[2:51:21] <skagtheprinceofhell> Pat talked about that for 14 with you Woolie
[2:51:27] <stormhawk9891> They changed EVERYONE in XIV
[2:51:27] <Hessman212> Pour one out for Nobuyuki Hiyama
[2:51:29] <+LastHazzerd> that said new Terry is pretty spot on
[2:51:30] <+Superbro64> woolie has gained insight and he hates it LUL
[2:51:30] <mister_z_1994> Geese is still the same though
[2:51:31] <%livlinn> LUL
[2:51:32] <inorwise> so outrageous you didn't even realize
[2:51:33] <+alphatwo> I could tell with K' right away, he sounds way different
[2:51:36] <JohnXuandou> Iori has a new VA too, can you tell?
[2:51:38] <%RandoChris> Nah, Benimaru still has the same voice, along with Geese and King.
[2:51:40] <Josef_Stryker> I still can't believe Terry's VA also voices Potemkin
[2:51:45] <DedlokPM> Terry has many vas over the years
[2:51:50] <+LastHazzerd> Rush Kid
[2:51:50] <%jinking79> damn the exposed
[2:51:52] <AngryAsian5> LUL
[2:52:09] <mister_z_1994> Fun fact: Terry's original VA also voiced Optimus Prime once
[2:52:11] <+Superbro64> If they change Shen's voice actor when he comes back, I'm going lose my shit
[2:52:12] <skagtheprinceofhell> No I think it's because he died
[2:52:13] <+kewlmyc> What if they straight up retired, Woolie?
[2:52:15] <+LastHazzerd> LUL
[2:52:20] <%DashXero> Yeah... That hurts.
[2:52:21] <DSD24> This was leading to something
[2:52:25] <dds333a> It's like how Zato's voice passed
[2:52:33] <Josef_Stryker> VAs still don't get the respect they deserve after all this time
[2:52:36] <Lordryu2014> I think the only characters who still have their old VAs in this game are Athena, King, Kula, Whip, Benimaru, Maxima and Ash.
[2:52:38] <dds333a> It also changed in XIII
[2:52:38] <+Ricky_Rexx> Good on DiMaggio for standing up for his own worth
[2:52:38] <IceyCone> Some people just get too old to do stuff
[2:52:38] <%mighty_max_t> Chris is a huge surprise for me, never expected to like the kid
[2:52:56] <IceyCone> The Futurama stuff is bullshit though, yes
[2:52:56] <+Superbro64> well, to be fair here, there's David Hater to Sutherland, and then their's vic (broly)
[2:52:58] <+zanz_san> Iori voices Japanese Mickey Mouse
[2:53:03] <DSD24> No face shadow boy
[2:53:04] <+polothegreatest> Iori is spot on plaguePog
[2:53:08] <+thedream_c> easy char design
[2:53:08] <+Superbro64> who was the guy who voiced super broly? Vic something
[2:53:09] <DSD24> He's got a cursed face
[2:53:10] <+Ricky_Rexx> @zanz_san Brb need to hear what japanese mickey sounds like
[2:53:13] <+Superbro64> vic morgana?
[2:53:15] <Lordryu2014> I just got in here a couple minutes ago btw, did they already do some online matches?
[2:53:18] <+thedream_c> like Shermie with no eyes
[2:53:20] <+kewlmyc> His faced is cursed or some shit
[2:53:24] <+thedream_c> so you can focus on her better assets
[2:53:24] <mister_z_1994> @Superbro64 Jonny Yong Bosch now because of...reasons
[2:53:28] <JohnXuandou> his face is a mystery, he does have an actual face they just don't reveal it
[2:53:37] <+Superbro64> @mister_z_1994 yup yup
[2:53:38] <+thedream_c> mystery liket he moving sands. LIke Evolution
[2:53:41] <dds333a> Mignogna
[2:53:41] <IceyCone> Its like shermie, don't worry about it
[2:53:43] <shenran14> I mean, the voice actor can also decide to not do it anymore, right?  I think Arcsys mention they couldn't get Anji's original va.
[2:53:44] <thomasvalentine31> Yeah but nothing beats the fact he just gangsternap the ladies and gender bends the guys
[2:53:45] <+thedream_c> Evolution is a mystery
[2:53:50] <%jinking79> his files say ppl that see his face r cured to die
[2:53:53] <roboyuji> He's the Detective Conan murderer placeholder guy
[2:53:58] <%RandoChris> Fun fact, Benimaru also voices Choi
[2:54:01] <nintega010> @Superbro64 johny does a good super broly his z broly is trash though
[2:54:04] <DSD24> He's got a cool mom in Dolores at least
[2:54:09] <TheDrown> Krohnens model does have eyes under his goggles
[2:54:24] <JohnXuandou> Shermie has hair under her hair
[2:54:33] <+kewlmyc> When did JYB get a chance to do Z Broly? I assume in one of the games?
[2:54:34] <+zanz_san> Dolores clearly spoils Kukhri
[2:54:40] <+thedream_c> and I bet Orochi Shermie will still have no eyes :)
[2:54:47] <+Superbro64> @nintega010 super broly is just screaming, and johnny is very good at that LUL
[2:54:48] <nintega010> @kewlmyc in doken game.
[2:54:51] <dds333a> Shermie's eyes have ONLY appeared on the cover of '97
[2:54:52] <Hessman212> @kewlmyc After the Broly movie casue Vic is Vic
[2:54:55] <+0neReeler> gamble shatter strike
[2:54:55] <DSD24> @zanz_san In the Rivals ending she is very nice to him
[2:55:05] <Lordryu2014> Shermie's model literally doesn't have eyes, it's just a red texture over the top half of her face underneath all the hair.
[2:55:07] <dds333a> You can barely see her eye under the fringe
[2:55:27] <+thedream_c> Chris...
[2:55:34] <nintega010> @Superbro64 yeah, but I've heard clips of him just talking for super broly and it's good it sounds just like vic.
[2:55:34] <+Superbro64> So does Team CYS still do concerts now that they're alive? Do they care about Orochi anymore?
[2:55:40] <JohnXuandou> 2 meters is the cost of Max, level 1 supers are free in max, level 2 and level 3 supers cost 1 more bar in max
[2:55:42] <%RandoChris> Yes to both @Superbro64
[2:55:43] <thomasvalentine31> regarding Vic, didn't it get revealed it was just an angry fan or something putting on all those stories and crap? I haven't heard much of it after a certain point.
[2:55:44] <+cubbywolf> android 21 when
[2:55:50] <Lordryu2014> @Superbro64 Yes to both
[2:56:03] <+zanz_san> they still do concerts and publicity as CYS
[2:56:07] <+kewlmyc> @Superbro64 Their ending shows that Chris still cares, but Shermie and Yashiro don't give a fuck. They're still part of a band and do shows.
[2:56:12] <Daxalog> Im surprised that health dosnt stay between rounds
[2:56:12] <Valorzard> They’re still doing the Orochi thing, but the concert stuff is their day job
[2:56:22] <thomasvalentine31> or am I getting mixed up with the crap that happened with the VA that voices  Raiden from Metal Gear?
[2:56:28] <dds333a> Does Yashiro still want to punch Iori in the face Kappa
[2:56:28] <Hessman212> @thomasvalentine31 Other VA's have come out with stories about him and they are not good
[2:56:34] <+Superbro64> Considering that Orochi is why they died in the first place, Id be funny that they'd be willing for more evil shenanigans
[2:56:35] <IceyCone> Yashiro cares a bit more than Shermie, but they have a long time
[2:57:03] <+Superbro64> Didn't they go in KOF because Iori crashed their concert or some dumb shit?
[2:57:06] <+thedream_c> yeah round healing is a big deal, especially tied to how much time is left
[2:57:10] <dds333a> @superbro64 Yashiro killed his teammates for that specific purpose, and none of them were against it
[2:57:12] <nintega010> @thomasvalentine31 it's a situation we moved on from. Vic is doing fine though
[2:57:12] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1493839904186503170?t=YO4iMpiXtS4ChklGkEnM1Q&s=19
[2:57:19] <+Superbro64> The Orochi thing was just a coincidence at the time?
[2:57:21] <+kewlmyc> Shermie just wants to fuck hot guys, and is apparently friends with Sylvie.
[2:57:25] <+polothegreatest> 97 plot LUL
[2:57:28] <IceyCone> That was a front, they always planned to Orochi things
[2:57:38] <BlackermanZX> XI was wild
[2:57:40] <dds333a> Also, yeah, Iori took their venue, and Yashiro was REALLY MAD about it LUL
[2:57:40] <JohnXuandou> XI is the KoF for Capcom fans lol
[2:57:41] <+thedream_c> XI def was wild. Probably wilder than people remember
[2:57:47] <xerotwo> 2001 tho LUL
[2:57:49] <$ggbhtg> limp super, let's goooo
[2:57:50] <artificiallynatural> hope kof 11 gets ported up. It looks sick
[2:57:51] <+Superbro64> @kewlmyc Sylvie Paula Paula? the NESTS reject?
[2:57:51] <BlackermanZX> also i love the XI ost
[2:57:56] <xerotwo> EWW
[2:57:58] <+kewlmyc> @Superbro64 Yeah
[2:58:00] <@Solidus_113> flaccid
[2:58:01] <kulmoth> that super was so lame
[2:58:02] <Dova573> thats such a let down
[2:58:04] <xerotwo> M I D
[2:58:04] <+polothegreatest> Kof 2k02 plus 2 LUL
[2:58:06] <AngryAsian5> LUL
[2:58:08] <dds333a> LUL
[2:58:08] <+zanz_san> I was fine with charge character Robert in 2000
[2:58:09] <mister_z_1994> "Hey guys guess who's the main character of this game"
[2:58:10] <xerotwo> That was M I D
[2:58:11] <Dova573> LIKE IT FEELS UNIFINISHED
[2:58:12] <$ggbhtg> that shit was LIMP Reggie!
[2:58:13] <+Ultimate_Edge> They even sandbag the impact
[2:58:13] <+thedream_c> at high level XI had wild wild strategies
[2:58:15] <gespenstkick> Dork flame master
[2:58:16] <+alphatwo> I feel like that last hit needs way more oomph for the setup
[2:58:17] <$ggbhtg> it was LIMP, Reggie
[2:58:17] <+cubbywolf> Woolie; take everything GIVE REGGIE NOTHING
[2:58:20] <+Ultimate_Edge> What a lame protag
[2:58:20] <+cubbywolf> sandbag him moar
[2:58:21] <Josef_Stryker> Not even an explosion after that last hit
[2:58:21] <IceyCone> His super in the last game was a lot cooler
[2:58:23] <%zeroarturia> @Superbro64 In 97 they had their gig taken away because the band Iori plays bass in was more popular than they were, thus why yashiro had them enter KOF
[2:58:25] <skagtheprinceofhell> More fire.
[2:58:25] <xerotwo> Reggie, that was M I D LUL
[2:58:27] <+zanz_san> Shuneinis okay
[2:58:29] <+Superbro64> @kewlmyc I miss Sylvie :(
[2:58:32] <Lordryu2014> Such a buildup and then just PUNCH.
[2:58:32] <%jinking79> lamest lvl 3 super
[2:58:34] <+alphatwo> The setup is fantastic, just need to modify the finish
[2:58:36] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> Can’t wait for last game for him to get a real climax
[2:58:38] <%TreeLeafBoi> I think the new girl is way too bratty for me
[2:58:41] <Dova573> Kill shunei, EMBRACE ISLA
[2:58:45] <+kewlmyc> Honestly, I miss Sylvie too.
[2:58:47] <skagtheprinceofhell> @Lordryu2014 No, not even a punch
[2:58:47] <+Superbro64> @zeroarturia they beat up the sports team for the ticket, ye?
[2:58:47] <thomasvalentine31> Wait: Iori plays in a music ban?
[2:58:49] <+zanz_san> he's not an edge boy
[2:58:50] <+CrimsonDio11> @WoolieVersus okay so you dont like Shun'ei but what are your thoughts on Isla?
[2:58:51] <+thedream_c> Isla being bratty? I think that was the intention
[2:58:51] <+cubbywolf> Dunk on reggie hour
[2:58:52] <%RandoChris> I dunno, Ryo's level 3 doesn't hit like it used to
[2:58:52] <+LastHazzerd> Reggie forever for the poster boy
[2:58:53] <thomasvalentine31> *band
[2:59:00] <Hessman212> I love that Shun'ei will most likely be top tier
[2:59:03] <Mvrdok_> He just have to go all the way to the other side or throwing them to the ground to make it more impactful LUL
[2:59:06] <+thedream_c> I like Isla visually
[2:59:06] <+cubbywolf> omg freedom convoy get off my news feed you shits
[2:59:08] <dds333a> Iori plays bass
[2:59:10] <%zeroarturia> @Superbro64 Yep they took their invites LOL
[2:59:14] <+kewlmyc> Isla just walked off a KDA music video
[2:59:15] <%Demoli_PT> isla is way cooler than that dork shuunei
[2:59:19] <mister_z_1994> @dds333a He's a sax man
[2:59:19] <+absolutenc> Shun'ei is cool crendorRatjam
[2:59:19] <skagtheprinceofhell> Not really
[2:59:19] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Jet Set Ramlethal
[2:59:26] <+Superbro64> Rivals team has that rap song and I do not like it
[2:59:29] <+thedream_c> yeah Jet Set Ramlethal is a good vibe
[2:59:30] <odd_slater> Tribal leg tat in 2022 lol
[2:59:30] <thomasvalentine31> I actually didn't know Iroi was in a band.
[2:59:31] <zepelinnn1> Isla gets the girl pass
[2:59:31] <+alphatwo> @Dova573 Too bad Isla got smacked in the story and Shun'ei had to bail her out lol
[2:59:32] <%DashXero> Isla looks cool. Isla is kinda...
[2:59:38] <kulmoth> isla >>>>>> that background character on this stage >>> shunei
[2:59:45] <BlackermanZX> the fact that Isla is from Chile is wild LUL
[2:59:50] <dds333a> @mister_z_1994 he LIKES sax, but he PLAYS bass LULbass
[2:59:51] <dds333a> LUL
[2:59:58] <Hessman212> Her colors work really great and help with her over-designed elements
[3:00:07] <+thedream_c> this current KOF arc is taking morechars from different places of the world
[3:00:10] <seaechiowai> ?
[3:00:10] <+kewlmyc> Vaan? Yeah I suppose
[3:00:13] <+thedream_c> South America, Middle East, Africa,
[3:00:17] <yukichocomilk> vaan wasn't the main anyway
[3:00:20] <+LastHazzerd> need that flagship
[3:00:24] <thomasvalentine31> So, does that mean in KOF 16, we'll get ANOTHER charaacter with floating spectre hands and we'll have a team of Shun'el, Isla and other Spectre person vs a Verse?
[3:00:24] <odd_slater> No Vaan slander
[3:00:29] <+Superbro64> Shunei's issue is that SNK refuses to give him a centralized design theme, or design palette
[3:00:30] <+cubbywolf> who will the male audience identify with if not a bland anime protagonist?
[3:00:31] <+LastHazzerd> all Vaan Slander
[3:00:33] <+kewlmyc> Vaan is the main character on paper only from what I understand
[3:00:41] <+Superbro64> Even Sylvie looks more "consistent" them him
[3:00:46] <IceyCone> @thomasvalentine31 oh absolutely, they do that for every arc
[3:00:46] <JdotSweapA> im Captain BAsch!
[3:00:52] <+thedream_c> Woolie is looking for antoer DROPKICK character?
[3:00:55] <nintega010> nah
[3:00:57] <PFlare> Ashe is the actual MC.
[3:00:58] <+thedream_c> cmon man you had a chance with Najd :p
[3:00:59] <BlackermanZX> WHO
[3:01:08] <Hessman212> Nah Guy Tendo should be the new Hero
[3:01:12] <BlackermanZX> oh the XIII guy
[3:01:12] <dds333a> Raiden is the BEST
[3:01:13] <DeathByPoke7> at least he knows how to introduce himself
[3:01:19] <dds333a> Big Bear is also great
[3:01:19] <%TreeLeafBoi> Basch Lives!
[3:01:22] <+alphatwo> Vaan was intended to not stand out, if you believe the devs.  He was intended to be an observer everyman to the craxy stuff happening while Ashe had more focus
[3:01:25] <odd_slater> Ash had his arc tho lol
[3:01:30] <SrHassan> Shingo, Adhelheid or Kensou wouldve worked as new mc
[3:01:30] <+LastHazzerd> LUL
[3:01:31] <%mighty_max_t> thought you meant Mk Raiden for a second, haha
[3:01:31] <+kewlmyc> I forgot Raiden was a thing. Thought you were talking about MGS for a second.
[3:01:35] <thomasvalentine31> Redeemed Rugal: the protag of KOF 17
[3:01:44] <%RandoChris> I want Shingo back so bad
[3:01:51] <+Superbro64> Nintendo?? @woolieversus Kappa
[3:01:52] <%RandoChris> The dorkiest DIO
[3:01:53] <+thedream_c> Kensou as new MC? Nah. He's been around for so long and nobody cared
[3:01:54] <dds333a> Gai, imagine LUL
[3:01:55] <+zanz_san> Ryo became Mr. Karate 2 in this, he should be the new hero.
[3:01:58] <%Shad0wTag> GIVE US SHINGO
[3:02:03] <mister_z_1994> Well Capcom did with Alex and we all know how that turned out
[3:02:07] <Qsmash_> no
[3:02:07] <Dova573> nO
[3:02:08] <%Shad0wTag> WITH FLAMES
[3:02:08] <+thedream_c> nah Shiingo hasn't :p
[3:02:09] <JohnXuandou> they should correct their mistakes and make Adelheid the protagonist like he was supposed to be in 2003
[3:02:09] <Rojo_Hou> Shingo could be DLC
[3:02:15] <+absolutenc> wooooo Shun'ei!!! crendorRatjam crendorRatjam crendorRatjam
[3:02:17] <Rojo_Hou> Finally learns to shoot flames
[3:02:17] <+kewlmyc> Nah, if Shingo returns, have him still suck ass and be random as fuck
[3:02:17] <%ChoculaUltra> I need Shingo to come back with BLUE FLAMES please
[3:02:19] <%DashXero> That would be like Sean coming into his own.
[3:02:19] <+Superbro64> shingo hasnt been in a game in like 10 years haha
[3:02:20] <+thedream_c> Shingo had a shot in the 90s and the 2000s and he stayed the way he is
[3:02:22] <+thedream_c> the lovable loser
[3:02:25] <%TheQuadrupleS> Shingo is trash LUL
[3:02:25] <+alphatwo> Kensou would need to be reworked so bad he might as well be a different character to work as an MC lol
[3:02:32] <%AlteisenReiseZ> The true return should be TEAM USA
[3:02:34] <%Shad0wTag> HES SUPPOSED TO BE TRAINING
[3:02:35] <AngryAsian5> LUL
[3:02:44] <%Reverend_Roscoe> ALL OF EM
[3:02:46] <%jinking79> shingo has to be the Sean of the series
[3:02:48] <%RandoChris> Nobody else can fuckin' critical like Shingo can
[3:02:48] <dds333a> still training with Saisyu
[3:02:50] <+kewlmyc> Kensou sucks, I'm glad he's gone
[3:02:51] <SrHassan> Saisyu was training Shingo no?
[3:02:51] <TheDrown> Bring Magaki back lytDORF
[3:02:52] <+thedream_c> the fact Beni managed at best to be coach of the new protag team shows his forever status as B-lister
[3:02:52] <SaiyanShoto> Nahhh I’ll take Shun’ei over Shingo, Shingo is so lame
[3:02:55] <+zanz_san> Kensou is worse than Shunei
[3:03:04] <JohnXuandou> EX Galactica Phantom is a Bionic Arm now, it's fine
[3:03:07] <Mvrdok_> Wasn't Saisyu teaching Shingo?
[3:03:07] <BlackermanZX> I mean they are soul taking for Reggie
[3:03:07] <+zanz_san> Kensou is awful
[3:03:10] <%TheQuadrupleS> Poor Reggie
[3:03:11] <Hessman212> Kensou is a dork and everybody know it
[3:03:16] <IceyCone> Shingo is lame and that's the point, he was already a protagonist in 99
[3:03:18] <+thedream_c> Kensou is just known to be that dude in Yuri and Friends
[3:03:19] <%ChoculaUltra> Shingo was right there but SNK was like nah lets grab every clashing design idea ever and shit out Shun'ei
[3:03:23] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Shingo > Shun'ei > Power Gap > Kensou
[3:03:26] <%Shad0wTag> Yes he was
[3:03:28] <+kewlmyc> Kensous whole thing is being a simp and meat buns. Shit sucks.
[3:03:34] <dds333a> Kensou even had that subplot back during NESTS
[3:03:36] <%RandoChris> Shingo is canonically a KOF champion
[3:03:40] <+Superbro64> Isnt Kenso a super athena simp?
[3:03:42] <+alphatwo> I seriously think Shun'ei only needs a redesign on his outfit and more sauce on his Climax super and he'd honestly be fine
[3:03:46] <BlackermanZX> I liked Kensou way more in XIII
[3:03:47] <%RandoChris> Yes, he had Benimaru, Maxima, and K' but he's still an official winner
[3:03:59] <+Superbro64> and Athena ignoring his affections IS the joke of that team?
[3:04:03] <+thedream_c> YES
[3:04:05] <%DashXero> Where's Butt?
[3:04:12] <JohnXuandou> a new Garou is going to happen though

[3:04:28] <+cmac92> We need American Sports Team as the protagonist
[3:04:28] <b_ikki> my boy kevin
[3:04:30] <JohnXuandou> Yasuyuki Oda outright said SNK is going to make a Garou 2 eventually
[3:04:31] <Blank9> Grant
[3:04:31] <spinbel> No one needs Freeman
[3:04:32] <%ChoculaUltra> We'll never see Rock in business attire as Kain's bodyguard FeelsBadMan
[3:04:33] <+thedream_c> Kain has a cool playstyle too
[3:04:34] <SaiyanShoto> Is Marco Butt?
[3:04:34] <mister_z_1994> Garou 2 revival any day now boys doodSad
[3:04:34] <+the22cstomp> freeman will never be added to another game

[3:05:15] <DeathByPoke7> all the pants animations on one team
[3:05:17] <Lordryu2014> The Kim Kids can come back for Garou 2.
[3:05:19] <BlackermanZX> Just give his pants an entire character slot
[3:05:20] <%jinking79> that's my Season 2 Dream team Man
[3:05:21] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @Lordryu2014 May Lee NEEDS to come back

[3:05:24] <+thedream_c> EZ buy
[3:05:30] <%Shad0wTag> THE PANTS

[3:05:55] <+thedream_c> andy's students get got zero drip :p
[3:06:03] <BlackermanZX> Yeah where the FUCK is Adelheid
[3:06:07] <Hessman212> What if they use the unused ideas for Garou two?
[3:06:10] <IceyCone> Gimme Kizuna Encounter. fuck it
[3:06:10] <+zanz_san> kasumi is foney
[3:06:21] <%Shad0wTag> Team Shiranui with Andy and Mai right?
[3:06:24] <+zanz_san> fuck u autocorrect
[3:06:25] <+thedream_c> i doubt kasumi comes back. People will complain she's not as buff as in 02 UM or something
[3:06:31] <Mvrdok_> Adelheid, Rose and Rugal as a team would be fun LUL
[3:06:33] <skagtheprinceofhell> @thedream_c I mean, it's Andy's STUDENTS. Where would they learn such things from?
[3:06:35] <+kewlmyc> Who the fuck is Hinata? I assume you mean Hinako?
[3:06:40] <nesbitt22> When Team Duck King?
[3:06:40] <%AlteisenReiseZ> BRING BACK KRAUSER
[3:06:41] <JohnXuandou> yeah because SNK was on fire and running out of money
[3:06:43] <thomasvalentine31> I'm surprised Adelheid is slept on so hard
[3:06:45] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @nesbitt22 THIS
[3:06:45] <%zeroarturia> @Hessman212 I would hope Joe's student comes back in some way
[3:06:56] <+thedream_c> Hinako as a char playstyle is interesting. Dunno if she's popular enough to warrant being back
[3:06:59] <%notsoy> shion
[3:07:00] <IceyCone> Shining?
[3:07:01] <BlackermanZX> i cant believe they still haven't done Rock vs Adelheid
[3:07:02] <AstrodropGaming> Adelheid needs a personality beyond 'Son of Rugal'
[3:07:02] <TheDrown> Shion
[3:07:03] <+zanz_san> Krauser would be great
[3:07:04] <+thedream_c> Shion
[3:07:07] <SrHassan> shion
[3:07:07] <+Superbro64> who is the boy Mai and Andy train, who shows up in Garou?
[3:07:08] <JohnXuandou> Adelheid was supposed to be a secondary protagonist but SNK had no money
[3:07:10] <+kewlmyc> For real though, bring back AMERICAN SPORTS TEAM
[3:07:13] <IceyCone> Shion autocorrect jeez
[3:07:17] <%zeroarturia> @kewlmyc Oh shit you're it is Hinako! my bad
[3:07:17] <Hessman212> @zeroarturia I just want them to fianlly make GArou 2
[3:07:19] <skagtheprinceofhell> @thedream_c Hinako is the little girl doing sumo right?

[3:07:23] <%mighty_max_t> Anyone else loving the XV soundtrack? Only miss is the team Fatal Fury song
[3:07:27] <+thedream_c> Hinako made sumo look interesting
[3:07:28] <+zanz_san> Shion cool too
[3:07:29] <JdotSweapA> make shion playable jeez. hinting him at the end of 13
[3:07:30] <%Shad0wTag> Krauser should return organ music and all

[3:07:41] <+kewlmyc> Hinako is the sumo chick, yes
[3:07:41] <+thedream_c> in an era where your only sumo protags are these dorky round dudes
[3:07:49] <JohnXuandou> my gee
[3:07:51] <+kewlmyc> Also bring back Bao for the rage of everyone
[3:07:53] <thomasvalentine31> I keep on forgetting Shion's a guy
[3:07:57] <skagtheprinceofhell> My friend wants Hinako back because he liked using her and also she was funny to use a little girl to do normal sumo moves with
[3:07:59] <thomasvalentine31> Magaki still kinda MIA right?
[3:08:00] <+zanz_san> Krauser and his perfect English
[3:08:01] <%zeroarturia> @mighty_max_t needs more Sax
[3:08:02] <+thedream_c> Shion was also a mixup for its time
[3:08:03] <%ChoculaUltra> KOF Another Day by Production IG still holds up today, crazy we haven't gotten more animated KOF shit since the little anime intro XV got

[3:08:53] <+SneakyBeaver102> Reggie hahaha
[3:08:55] <AngryAsian5> Stop trying to make Shun'ei a thing Reggie LUL
[3:08:56] <%zeroarturia> @kewlmyc I feel KOF needs a Sumo character.
[3:09:01] <%DkLordG> Next session, Reggie comes cosplayed as Shenei
[3:09:01] <%notsoy> the series ALREADY has actually cool chuuni designs like kyo/iori
[3:09:02] <+absolutenc> shun'ei is just too cool crendorClap
[3:09:07] <%DashXero> Meitenkun should have been the main character.
[3:09:13] <nintega010> @zeroarturia they have one it's a girl
[3:09:16] <%ChoculaUltra> Shun'ei's design SCREAMS a room full of old dudes thinking about how to get Gen Z kids into KOF
[3:09:16] <skagtheprinceofhell> Wait wait, the fuck is chunni about Kyo?
[3:09:17] <%DashXero> Give us the sleepy boi.

[3:09:32] <rufus2k2> what's with purple koolaid Elisabeth
[3:09:38] <+kewlmyc> Sleepy Boi as the main character would be weird as fuck to be honest
[3:09:43] <AstrodropGaming> You gotta be a little weird to be a streamer
[3:09:55] <Valorzard> @askeladd99 no tizoc IS king of dinosaur
[3:09:57] <%jinking79> can't support Reggie
[3:09:59] <+thedream_c> Isla may be new main in 17
[3:10:05] <%zeroarturia> @nintega010 yeah Hinako, and I hope she can come back but chances are low
[3:10:21] <+vp_richard_hawk> vp_richard_hawk subscribed with Prime. 
[3:10:30] <askeladd99> @Valorzard what are you talking about
[3:10:33] <rufus2k2> Hinako needs to come back bring the fear of god to people
[3:10:40] <Daxalog> Whats up with metal slug anyway? Seems like they keep finding new ways to reuse those sprites.
[3:10:49] <+kewlmyc> Shunei/Sleepy boi/Isla will probably be the new team in KOF XVI
[3:10:57] <+thedream_c> the fans wanted more metal slug and SNK gave it
[3:10:59] <AngryAsian5> LUL
[3:11:01] <+thedream_c> as a stage in KOF XV
[3:11:10] <rufus2k2> Metal Slug Tactics this year right?
[3:11:13] <dds333a> @astrodropgaming that so? LUL
[3:11:13] <+thedream_c> i'm not surprised SNK hasn't milked them more
[3:11:13] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:11:19] <+dr_steve1790> This stage has my favorite track in the game
[3:11:23] <odd_slater> @rufus2k2 Yes
[3:11:26] <dds333a> @choculaultra it wasn't good LUL
[3:11:30] <+thedream_c> in fact SNK should give us team Metal Slug
[3:11:30] <rufus2k2> @thedream_c the mobile game is full of content
[3:11:32] <Hessman212> @dr_steve1790 TRUTH
[3:11:32] <thomasvalentine31> That's right, Metal Slug is in the same universe as KOF.
[3:11:35] <nesbitt22> Did anyone like May Lee?
[3:11:37] <rufus2k2> too bad it's a damn mobile game
[3:11:43] <+kewlmyc> People loved May Lee
[3:11:47] <%mighty_max_t> May Lee rules
[3:11:51] <+thedream_c> KOF all stars is a mobile game and I like the collab
[3:11:56] <dds333a> May Lee Jinju is MY GIRL
[3:11:59] <BlackermanZX> i mean the Ikari Warriors are literally team Metal Slug
[3:12:01] <rufus2k2> May "I'm A Kamen Rider" Lee
[3:12:02] <AstrodropGaming> @dds333a Yeah dude, EVERY streamer has their quirk(s)
[3:12:05] <Qsmash_> @ChoculaUltra They actually got a younger designer to design Shun'ei.
[3:12:07] <dds333a> Stance extraordinaire
[3:12:09] <%zeroarturia> @thedream_c ah yes team zoners
[3:12:20] <Valorzard> The time line of this universe is samurai showdown -> fatal fury -> Kof with metal slug happening sometime in between, right?
[3:12:27] <dds333a> @astrodropgaming as far as any of us know LUL
[3:12:32] <%notsoy> do stick input, hold button
[3:12:35] <BlackermanZX> Fio on kof would be great tho
[3:12:39] <streamingafterdark> @Qsmash_ It shows
[3:12:40] <dds333a> Gotta play a character
[3:12:42] <odd_slater> It's a legacy thing too lol
[3:12:46] <+thedream_c> if John Cena worked in KOF All stars mobile, maybe he could work in KOF XV
[3:12:54] <%Shad0wTag> I want even more and less subtle kamen rider references from May
[3:12:55] <JohnXuandou> legacy meaning KoFXIII yes
[3:12:59] <AstrodropGaming> @dds333a LUL Kappa
[3:13:04] <%zeroarturia> @BlackermanZX she was in KOF MI 2
[3:13:05] <Hessman212> Lets get the Neo Turf Masters into KOF
[3:13:12] <+thedream_c> Isla has a rider kick animation for level 3 super?
[3:13:12] <dds333a> And NGBC
[3:13:13] <thomasvalentine31> @Valorzard That's the first time I've heard that. I know that Fatal Furry/KOF/Art of Fighting are all in the same universe.
[3:13:17] <+xxSailor_Goonxx> Do you think Kim could come back with Daimon as a team member?
[3:13:25] <IceyCone> samsho -> Art Of Fighting -> Fatal Fury -> King of Fighters specifically
[3:13:29] <odd_slater> Always been around I'm kicking myself for not knowing it
[3:13:29] <+thedream_c> nah Daimon is on team Family Man
[3:13:40] <+kewlmyc> Some of the Metal Slug characters are playable in the KOF spinoffs
[3:13:51] <BlackermanZX> @zeroarturia oh really? honestly i erased Maximum Impact from my mind LUL
[3:13:52] <Valorzard> Nakoruru is in KOF 14 cuz she’s immortal or some shit
[3:13:52] <odd_slater> @johnxuandou Nah I started doing it in 2k2 UM
[3:13:53] <+kewlmyc> At least Fio was
[3:13:53] <dds333a> @xxsailor_goonxx get the Asia Triple Alliance back together LUL
[3:14:01] <lovelycthulhu> lovelycthulhu subscribed at Tier 1. 
[3:14:02] <umbermarch> KOF is a seperate timeline from AOF and FF
[3:14:05] <rufus2k2> Iori Lupin
[3:14:05] <IceyCone> Metal Slug isn't referenced at all except the main team making cameos on occasion
[3:14:06] <+thedream_c> Nak was in KOF14 because she was part of team 'other dimension'
[3:14:15] <+thedream_c> Nak was paired with pachinko heroes Love HEart and Mui Mui
[3:14:19] <%zeroarturia> @thomasvalentine31 Not really the KOF games are on its own timeline.
[3:14:20] <dds333a> Man, now I have Shingo on the brain, I love him
[3:14:35] <+kewlmyc> Speaking of Love Heart, SNK doesn't have the license anymore, so you'll never see her again
[3:14:37] <+thedream_c> but it makes snse if Nak comes to KOF14 with her Samsho teammates instead
[3:14:38] <BlackermanZX> Isnt Love Heart eternally in copyright limbo or something
[3:14:43] <IceyCone> Nah AOF and FF both happened in KOF, just not 10 tears apart
[3:14:46] <+thedream_c> yeah Love Heart IP is not under SNK anymore
[3:14:47] <DSD24> Love Hearts gone now? aww
[3:14:51] <DSD24> She's cool
[3:14:51] <+thedream_c> Najd may be gone too
[3:15:00] <%ChoculaUltra> this is gonna sound crazy but I think Team Metal Slug could totally be on the table as a dlc team
[3:15:02] <+thedream_c> since Najd was part of an artist contest or something
[3:15:05] <IceyCone> since Terry remembers Real Bout
[3:15:10] <dds333a> Yeah, I would not be surprised if Najd NEVER comes back
[3:15:14] <odd_slater> Yeah character contest
[3:15:22] <+kewlmyc> Wasn't Najd the winner of a fan design contest. NOt sure why Najd can't return.
[3:15:43] <rufus2k2> Eri, Tarma and Allen o Neil as Team Metal Slug Kappa
[3:15:44] <+thedream_c> which gives me mor a reason to not delete KOF 14 in my game list. There were some designs unique to that game
[3:15:44] <odd_slater> But that sucks if she never comes back cause she was nuts in XIV
[3:15:50] <dds333a> I personally feel SNK mah not want to bother
[3:15:54] <+kewlmyc> If she really can't return, then that sucks. Najd's design was sick.
[3:15:59] <%zeroarturia> @IceyCone the events still happened but Geese isn't dead in the KOF timeline, unlike in fatal fury.
[3:16:02] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Banderias is cool, he can come back
[3:16:03] <+thedream_c> Najd has a cool stage too
[3:16:05] <nesbitt22> Was Bajd the Ninja in 14?
[3:16:08] <$infinite_rotation> How beginner friendly would you guys say this is?
[3:16:09] <BlackermanZX> at first i thought Najd was female Krizalid
[3:16:10] <Hessman212> Does AOF happen in the late 70's/ Early 80's? Wouldn't that Make Ryo and the gang like 50-60 now?
[3:16:11] <+the22cstomp> glad kukri is nuts again
[3:16:13] <nesbitt22> Naid
[3:16:17] <+thedream_c> Najd was the middle eastern rep in 14 came in DLC
[3:16:26] <dds333a> with the scarf
[3:16:28] <nesbitt22> Oh
[3:16:33] <IceyCone> Correct, Geese surviving is the main thing that seperates KOF and FF
[3:16:35] <rufus2k2> @Hessman212 welcome to the world of sliding timelines
[3:16:39] <+thedream_c> she also inherited the raiden dropkick
[3:16:54] <+cubbywolf> smile
[3:16:58] <+FoxLex_> @hessman212 AOF and FF take place further ahead in the KoF timeline
[3:17:16] <+thedream_c> AOF and FF do occur in Southtown USA
[3:17:16] <SaiyanShoto> I can’t look at him the same after SNK Heroines LUL
[3:17:19] <Lordryu2014> What if they pull a Krohnen and retool Najd into a new character?
[3:17:21] <+FoxLex_> AoF happening slightly before FF
[3:17:24] <Hessman212> @rufus2k2 I always thought that AOF and FF are in the Same universe, and KOF is an alternate universe
[3:17:24] <+thedream_c> but Southtown is BIGGER than what some may remember
[3:17:27] <+kewlmyc> @infinite_rotation Probably the most friendly KOF game to get into due to being new, but you need to learn 3 characters. Some mechanics like short hop might take a bit to get used to as well.
[3:17:36] <%ChoculaUltra> I like to think Geese canonically survived FF1 but was totally in the Tekken verse before coming back to KOF as a zombie then not a zombie.
[3:17:38] <BlackermanZX> i wonder if they will ever add Igniz and Krizalid
[3:17:39] <+FoxLex_> yes KoF is an alt universe
[3:17:45] <BlackermanZX> on the DLC
[3:17:52] <+thedream_c> yeah the way I remember KOF is its own universe
[3:17:54] <%zeroarturia> @Hessman212 Pretty much, but as KOF is in a different timeline, the events of AOF 1,2, & 3 do happen but just in the 90's.
[3:18:03] <thomasvalentine31> Art of Fighting 2 had a Young Geese Howard as the optional secret boss. I believe that was before he left to get stronger to kill Jeff Bogard.
[3:18:06] <+zanz_san> Ryo not being 10 years older is a thing too
[3:18:07] <dds333a> @choculaultra died in the hospital, and isekaied to Tekken LUL
[3:18:13] <IceyCone> AOF1 and 2 definitely happened in KOF since Geese remembers being beat by Ryo, but AOF3 isn't referenced at all except Kasumi's existence
[3:18:23] <Valorzard> Did you guys see the rumors of Bandai Namco making the new killer instinct? Lol what if Kazuya is in killer instinct

[3:19:15] <odd_slater> Idk how much I believe the rumors but  they would need good netcode before worrying about any guest characters lol

[3:40:30] <PFlare> Son then Mother. Then some rando military dude.
[3:40:42] <jellssssss20> Is Ralf the dad to the Mom and Son?
[3:40:57] <DSD24> Well hey Dolores is collegues with Heidern so I'm sure Ralf and her are introduced
[3:40:59] <+LastHazzerd> pocket sand
[3:41:02] <askeladd99> ralf is the mom
[3:41:08] <%mighty_max_t> Man, this is such a good track
[3:41:13] <dds333a> Ralf is absolutely the mom
[3:41:14] <PFlare> @DSD24 Yeah, they know each other in the Rivals Ending.
[3:41:14] <DSD24> I like this color for Dolores
[3:41:25] <%Shad0wTag> BANGER
[3:41:27] <PFlare> Or at least they're acquainted.
[3:41:54] <dds333a> Ralf knows how to handle his military juniors, while also being an insufferable jackass
[3:42:27] <DSD24> That's a good button
[3:42:30] <PFlare> But yeah. Dolores has two command grabs. One a low hit grab, the other is an air-only grab.
[3:42:54] <PFlare> As in the opponent has to be in the air.
[3:42:55] <DSD24> I think one of her exs puts the enemy in the air right?
[3:43:07] <DSD24> The one on the floor I think
[3:43:11] <PFlare> One of her EXs and her target combo.
[3:43:18] <dds333a> nice
[3:43:27] <RyuuAoi> Sounds like the boss theme from super mario world world 1
[3:43:30] <+LastHazzerd> Murdered
[3:43:33] <PFlare> And of course, she can just snatch you out of the air if the player's quick enough.
[3:43:53] <helixidron> roll has a pretty significant recovery, yeah
[3:43:59] <DSD24> Her target combo is heavy kick into heavy punch right?
[3:44:04] <PFlare> Yup.

[4:01:15] <odd_slater> YEYEYEYEYEYE
[4:01:22] <gruulmagebeast> playstation apparently has a lot of native delay so people are defaulting to pc
[4:01:22] <dds333a> Seems like
[4:01:23] <+FoxLex_> It gives me an excuse to play Jimmy on my team
[4:01:23] <%Th3SmartAlec> Another round... right after playing the UMVC3 Vergil mod Kappa

[4:03:30] <dds333a> Yashiro <3
[4:03:33] <SaiyanShoto> Actually the cross play thing isn’t because of Sony, Strive is getting cross play between everything in the future. It comes down to the devs now
[4:04:12] <+darkfoxxs> Andy
[4:04:24] <+FoxLex_> Well Jimmy, we'll have to play later than

[4:05:32] <SaiyanShoto> @andre11dr that was a long while ago. They said they’re cool with cross play now a couple years or so ago. That’s why Strive is getting cross play in the future

[4:10:49] <zenith0111> SILENCE
[4:10:53] <dds333a> @dsd24 DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN
[4:11:03] <+TopTieramisu> the models look good. it's the lighting that could be plused to great effect imo
[4:11:16] <DSD24> @dds333a I was hearing that song this morning so it was on the mind
[4:11:31] <PFlare> Dolores, after that command normal, can- oh.
[4:11:41] <dds333a> @dsd24 DAMN good song
[4:11:43] <PFlare> Woolie said it.
[4:11:50] <andre11dr> I think Elizabeth's effects look really ugly ,they look like default Unreal assets
[4:11:56] <dds333a> @pflare mind meld LUL
[4:12:01] <PFlare> Although there's another route that you can do EX mud stab.
[4:12:05] <DSD24> @PFlare I still appreciate you going to say it
[4:12:08] <PFlare> And go into supers or grab.
[4:12:12] <+0neReeler> f+a
[4:12:26] <+TopTieramisu> anyone remember tekken 7 when it was initially released in arcades? it went through a huge graphical revamp when it was released on console
[4:12:31] <PFlare> Because the second hit of EX mud stab will send them back towards you and put them in range for it.
[4:12:43] <DSD24> Tekken 7 Fated Retribution right? @TopTieramisu
[4:12:47] <PFlare> Less damage, but also less meter usage and keeps them close.
[4:12:47] <+TopTieramisu> yeah
[4:13:03] <xerotwo> POCKET SAND!
[4:13:08] <dds333a> LUL
[4:13:08] <PFlare> SPECIAL
[4:13:15] <andre11dr> @toptieramisu Yeah arcade Tekken 7 was rough, that shit looked a little better than 6
[4:13:17] <+TopTieramisu> it'd be real nice if snk did something similar for this game
[4:13:17] <+polothegreatest> Then again tekken7 480p on xbx plagueSad
[4:13:22] <dds333a> Family matters Kappa
[4:13:50] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> The piano going off
[4:14:03] <PFlare> "IT'S NOT A PHASE, MOM."
[4:14:23] <andre11dr> Honestly even current T7 is kinda rough looking, especially when they get sweaty, the caracters have a weird glossy look to them
[4:14:35] <+TopTieramisu> t7 is also pretty old now
[4:14:47] <dds333a> @andre11dr holy shit, I share the exact same sentiment
[4:14:48] <+TungstenoViperante> i'm gonna say it DOA5 looks better than T7
[4:14:50] <PFlare> I like how whenever there's a special theme, it just takes over.
[4:14:57] <+kewlmyc> Tekken 7 is like 5+ years old now
[4:15:00] <PFlare> Even when the characters involved are out.
[4:15:00] <%primarch_lupercal> noctis looks like he's drowning in sweat everytime
[4:15:18] <+BlowFireThroatTotem> hey guys, anyone down for some poopy snacks?

[4:17:04] <+TopTieramisu> so floaty
[4:17:15] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> And clips through everything
[4:17:16] <+TopTieramisu> and they clip all over as well
[4:17:18] <%ChoculaUltra> @andre11dr that one Ken alt costume with the jacket and short hair is a war crime
[4:17:32] <DSD24> @ChoculaUltra Oh yeah that uggo Ken
[4:17:32] <+BlowFireThroatTotem> damn y'all, just play mortal Kombat 11
[4:17:34] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> Laura’s hair is like half inside of her chest
[4:17:41] <%slipdog> Mk11 has some of the ugliest animations tho
[4:17:54] <+TopTieramisu> ugly animations is netherrealm's "brand"
[4:17:55] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> Or just play some KOF15 Kappa
[4:17:57] <+polothegreatest> Permanent MH costume on ken LUL
[4:17:58] <+zanz_san> Ken looked bad in SF4 and SF5
[4:18:05] <+kewlmyc> Fuck, I hear it
[4:18:06] <ItsZelus> I was thinking the same!!
[4:18:07] <zepelinnn1> IT DOES
[4:18:08] <%Th3SmartAlec> ...yeah, I hear it
[4:18:09] <Qsmash_> is that a good thing?
[4:18:11] <%Irridium> yep
[4:18:12] <verscoll> I can't unhear it now damn
[4:18:13] <ItsZelus> Its the trumpet thingy
[4:18:14] <andre11dr> The more i think about it ,from a pure visual standpoint Strive and MK 11 ia like the best it gets in fighting games
[4:18:16] <xerotwo> Dangan or TWEWY
[4:18:17] <+Superbro64> is this isla's theme?
[4:18:17] <+BlowFireThroatTotem> no, I was talking to all the graphic simps in chat
[4:18:20] <+LastHazzerd> still TWEWY to me
[4:18:21] <Daxalog> Give into Despair!
[4:18:30] <%townzzzzz> woolieKICKDAD
[4:18:33] <Leonheart777> Sounds like Twewy
[4:18:34] <+kewlmyc> @Superbro64 Isla/Dolores/Heidern theme
[4:18:42] <%slipdog> graphic simps bro come on, its not even fidelity thats the problem. its art direction
[4:18:50] <funnyfunnykid> This is the music my ADHD friend would show me and immediately choke me upon disliking it.
[4:18:51] <+Superbro64> Team Rival's theme then
[4:19:06] <dds333a> @funnyfunnykid um
[4:19:12] <%RandoChris> When y'all gonna unlock and use the 2001 soundtrack? Kappa
[4:19:24] <%slipdog> good jukebox is +10 in a fighter
[4:19:29] <+BlowFireThroatTotem> yeah, what's wrong with this art direction? looks better than King of fighters 14
[4:19:32] <+kewlmyc> 2001 soundtrack is so ass
[4:19:34] <+BlowFireThroatTotem> more consistent at least
[4:19:37] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> @funnyfunnykid Your friend sounds like me when I show Yakuza to my friends and they just ignore it and go back to playing Destiny
[4:19:38] <RyuuAoi> It's also mario word
[4:19:42] <RyuuAoi> World
[4:19:43] <andre11dr> @randochris Hey at least Igniz had a fire theme LUL
[4:19:47] <+dr_steve1790> They play this song in the hood.
[4:19:48] <dds333a> I unironically love the '01 soundtrack due to the percussion
[4:19:51] <+SeventhVice> It’s just the trumpet that makes you think of danganronpa
[4:19:52] <+BlowFireThroatTotem> hell, looks better than Sam show, outside of the endings
[4:20:01] <dds333a> Psychic Guys is FANTASTIC
[4:20:25] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> It’s pretty much all the music and you can set it to stages
[4:20:44] <%RandoChris> Customize is if you want to change the song but not mess up your jukebox playlist.

[4:20:49] <%slipdog> @BlowFireThroatTotem that is NOT where the bar is sadly
[4:20:50] <+kewlmyc> Got unlock everything but 94 and XIV though
[4:20:52] <andre11dr> Ok ,what's the best and worst soundtracks ?
[4:20:57] <+Superbro64> what I liked about older kof stages is that they transistioned between rounds
[4:20:59] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> A song per stage but it’s pretty much all the SNK music
[4:21:00] <+TopTieramisu> in fighting games?
[4:21:09] <andre11dr> No just KOF
[4:21:10] <+BlowFireThroatTotem> what bar?
[4:21:10] <+Superbro64> like that one stage in '00 that got rainier
[4:21:12] <+kewlmyc> Worst is 2001 by a long shot in term of mainline KOF
[4:21:17] <+0neReeler> worst: 2001
[4:21:29] <%RandoChris> 98/XIII are my go-to favorites.
[4:21:36] <andre11dr> I really like 99 as far as soundtrack goes
[4:21:48] <+kewlmyc> I really like XIV as well, though it's mostly the remixes
[4:21:53] <%slipdog> LUL
[4:21:56] <dds333a> best soundtrack is '97 and '98, but I don't think '01 is the worst, I love it LUL
[4:22:04] <%RandoChris> Worst is 2001 followed by XII by a big margin.
[4:22:09] <%ChoculaUltra> 2000 ad a p fire soundtrack. Goodbye Esaka is goated
[4:22:12] <andre11dr> 98 and 2002 are kinda good because there's so many songs
[4:22:22] <dds333a> Worst for me is definitely XI, it's pretty weak
[4:22:22] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1493839904186503170?t=YO4iMpiXtS4ChklGkEnM1Q&s=19
[4:22:40] <andre11dr> 2002 um that is ,og 2k2 soundtrack sounded like ass
[4:22:42] <+0neReeler> best: 02um, XIII, XI
[4:22:51] <dds333a> Love the intro these two have <3 LUL
[4:22:55] <+kewlmyc> I also like 99 just for Fallen Angel, but overall 98 or 02UM get it due to just the amount of songs
[4:22:58] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> I don’t have that much attachment to old KOFs + 15’s music are like all bangers so I just changed the main theme to Now Or Never and the Training Room theme to TERRY1978 (or whatever the numbers were)
[4:23:00] <%RandoChris> Yeah 2002UM is pretty stellar
[4:23:09] <%RandoChris> Terry115

[4:23:42] <+Superbro64> 95 has a bunch of okay tunes, and then iori's team theme randomly comes on is the BEST BY FAR for some reason
[4:23:46] <+kewlmyc> Shit's getting weird
[4:23:57] <+BlowFireThroatTotem> oh whatever chat, if that was a chick...
[4:24:07] <+0neReeler> 95 fatal fury team is pretty good
[4:24:10] <%slipdog> dangO dangO it got worse

[4:26:10] <+Tragosavich> Krohnen is cool, cant wait to see someone play him
[4:26:11] <dds333a> Yashiro is always great, but people don't play him Kappa
[4:26:20] <DSD24> Luong's sweep is really good
[4:26:21] <+DeathCubeK138> Kim isn't in but dime store Juri is

[4:26:40] <+TopTieramisu> pass
[4:26:42] <DSD24> @andre11dr She's cool I'm just not good with her
[4:27:13] <+Superbro64> Unfortunately Luong's boyfriend was under 170cm, so he was kicked out of KOFXV :(
[4:27:14] <andre11dr> Honestly i only like Chizuru because she was mad broken in 97
[4:27:18] <dds333a> @toptieramisu agreed, I want her power suit shoulders
[4:27:22] <dds333a> LUL

[4:27:35] <+0neReeler> and 98
[4:27:52] <%RandoChris> Yeah Gang-Il was a big disappointment
[4:27:53] <+TopTieramisu> kim's master is like the opposite of gouken
[4:27:55] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> Like his moves are simpler versions of Kim’s
[4:27:58] <cumurasame> wait is he literally a dino
[4:28:00] <+TopTieramisu> lamer than his student
[4:28:01] <DSD24> Isn't Luong married to Gang Il?

[4:28:48] <+TopTieramisu> i'll pass on gang-il. bring back jhun hoon
[4:28:58] <andre11dr> I cannot stand Kim's master, he looks like a NPC and his moveset is like an uninteresting Kim
[4:29:00] <dds333a> Gang-il hooks up all over the place when he goes out on tournaments
[4:29:00] <+Superbro64> @BlackMage66652 jimmy bones
[4:29:06] <DSD24> Jhun was the guy with really cool looking white hair right?

[4:31:00] <+Superbro64> Kim's not in because SNK doesnt want to animate pants :(
[4:31:01] <+Crunchy_the_clown> Thats why I liked Malin in XI
[4:31:05] <dds333a> Ralf DESTROYS unmarried strumpet
[4:31:09] <andre11dr> It's funny that i can remember Ron's name but i can't remember the name of his brother WHO IS PLAYABLE LUL

[4:31:59] <xUrbanCarnage> Stronk
[4:32:04] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> We need KOF Ultimate with ALL the warriors
[4:32:06] <%RandoChris> A thing I like about KOF is that even if only one team is the canon winner, there's a whole bunch of stories that move forward.
[4:32:09] <BlackermanZX> seems like a bad matchup
[4:32:09] <DSD24> @RandoChris Appreciate the clarification! I liked her she was neat
[4:32:19] <SaiyanShoto> Vanessa is crazy fun

[4:33:24] <SaiyanShoto> @dds333a I’m new to KOF since I started with 14 but Mars people! Idk if that’s obscure
[4:33:32] <%RandoChris> I only remember by name Moe and Reiji from GBA KOF, aka Kyo's last-minute teammates
[4:33:32] <DSD24> @xUrbanCarnage Well I haven't seen him in games in awhile, I just like his design
[4:33:39] <BlackermanZX> Bring back Lien Neville COWARDS
[4:33:45] <xUrbanCarnage> I used him in 98
[4:33:50] <DSD24> What about Ninon Beart
[4:34:02] <chillygreem> This is exactly how I felt when I played Blazblue for the first time
[4:34:09] <%RandoChris> Falcoon took those Maximum Impact characters with him lol
[4:34:18] <dds333a> YAY
[4:34:23] <+polothegreatest> The hold button hax plaguePog
[4:34:26] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> Then they must reclaim them
[4:34:28] <+TopTieramisu> i remember mars people being in an snk fighter
[4:34:31] <+TopTieramisu> it wasn't kof though
[4:34:39] <DSD24> @TopTieramisu CVS Chaos?
[4:34:42] <BlackermanZX> Mars ppl was in SvC Chaos
[4:34:45] <andre11dr> I kinda want Kasumi back, yeah she's lame but that kinda the charm
[4:34:49] <DSD24> Oh wait it was SvC
[4:34:50] <nesbitt22> Is Kukri just a JoJo character?
[4:34:50] <%RandoChris> SvC Chaos and Neo Geo Battle Coliseum
[4:34:53] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> Do the thing Reggie, For The Culture
[4:34:55] <+TopTieramisu> yeah, those two
[4:34:56] <BlackermanZX> Also Zero in SvC is rad as fuck
[4:35:03] <%RandoChris> Reggie has no meter
[4:35:09] <+TopTieramisu> mmz is dope
[4:35:15] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> He used it all
[4:35:23] <dds333a> @blackermanzx the fact that it was MMZ Zero, Kreygasm
[4:35:29] <%RandoChris> SKIPPIN' THE WIN POSE sprite23Wheeze
[4:35:32] <+TopTieramisu> wish his mmz design was used more in crossovers
[4:35:38] <DSD24> That win pose is real dangerous
[4:35:46] <zepelinnn1> yo let her win pose play out tho LUL
[4:35:51] <dds333a> @toptieramisu agreed
[4:35:54] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> That Win Pose is definitely a win
[4:36:03] <xUrbanCarnage> No horny allowed during lab hours
[4:36:04] <BlackermanZX> I need more Mmz stuff period
[4:36:07] <%RandoChris> Fuckin' Luong, Angel, and Mai's win poses are dangerous
[4:36:34] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> I have a prescription
[4:36:35] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:36:52] <DSD24> On the flip side, Dolores, King, and  Elizabeth's are all super cool
[4:37:00] <dds333a> These kof women are dangerous to Twitch LUL
[4:37:07] <+TopTieramisu> i really like isla too
[4:37:09] <BlackermanZX> Reggie playin Injustice over here woolieFROG
[4:37:16] <JohnXuandou> wakeup throw beats meaty
[4:37:18] <helixidron> throws beat meaties
[4:37:18] <gruulmagebeast> no throw beat meaty
[4:37:26] <%Irridium> this game is not for Good Boys and Girls™
[4:37:26] <DSD24> Isla is really spunky, its why I think she's cool
[4:37:26] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> Twitch’s core values kinda lackin
[4:37:31] <helixidron> whether you tech roll or not, btw
[4:37:39] <+heyitsdenzel_> Yo Grif- ... Dinosaur
[4:37:42] <helixidron> old kofs, meaties beat throws on hard knockdown
[4:37:45] <andre11dr> KoF has a bunch of classy ladies
[4:37:51] <dds333a> @heyitsdenzel_ LUL
[4:37:57] <dds333a> Holding the pose LUL
[4:38:01] <%slayabee> KOD loves TexMex
[4:38:02] <gruulmagebeast> so is luong basically female yamazaki gameplay wise?
[4:38:07] <%RandoChris> Kinda
[4:38:08] <xUrbanCarnage> Yup
[4:38:20] <xUrbanCarnage> Minus all the acrobatic stuff
[4:38:26] <DSD24> Flicker Kick
[4:38:36] <%RandoChris> Flicker Kick vs. Flicker Jab
[4:38:48] <xUrbanCarnage> Yamazaki just has a command grab and counter instead
[4:38:58] <dds333a> Snake Charmer to Charmer, I guess LUL
[4:39:13] <JohnXuandou> do the motion once and hold the button for reversals
[4:39:20] <andre11dr> Yamazaki also shanks yo ass
[4:39:24] <aeon_flex> They nerfed Yashiro too much
[4:39:43] <gruulmagebeast> yamazaki also has a swagger jacket in 15
[4:39:53] <%slayabee> Definitely gotta clean up the inputs, you will get supers and stuff by accident if you're not precise sometimes
[4:39:55] <dds333a> no TANOSHIN DERU LUL
[4:40:03] <gruulmagebeast> yashiro is still fun with his normals and lariat
[4:40:10] <xUrbanCarnage> Nice Ralf woolz
[4:40:20] <andre11dr> Yeah I'm really glad Yamazaki actually fights in his intro white coat now
[4:40:27] <dds333a> @gruulmagebeast is it confirmed that he keeps the coat on? cause he always used to take it off
[4:40:37] <DSD24> Team South Town more like Team Big Money
[4:40:38] <+TopTieramisu> wish blue mary had her jacket
[4:40:41] <dds333a> @andre11dr okay it is? cause I HATED that LUL
[4:40:52] <+TopTieramisu> it's not like she has her back muscles to show in this game
[4:41:03] <gruulmagebeast> @dds333a i mean he has a white coat in his portrait so i think he has it
[4:41:04] <andre11dr> @dds333a What you don't like the coat?
[4:41:19] <andre11dr> The coat looks boller
[4:41:23] <dds333a> no, maybe I was unclear, I hate that he took it OFF LUL
[4:41:33] <andre11dr> Ahh ok LUL
[4:41:48] <DSD24> Plenty of fighting games have cool characters take their jackets off and its always a bummer
[4:41:50] <%RandoChris> Geese, Billy, and Yamazaki out here doing collections
[4:41:53] <DSD24> Cyclops had a cool jacket
[4:42:12] <dds333a> Like he looks so sweet in Real Bout, and then, well, y'know
[4:42:16] <gruulmagebeast> i know team garou drops in march or whatever but when does tem south town come out again?
[4:42:33] <nintega010> april
[4:42:40] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> Team South Town on their way to fight Kiryu in his Real Estate substory
[4:42:41] <gruulmagebeast> oh ok cool so not too long
[4:42:49] <DSD24> That was cool
[4:42:50] <%RandoChris> Good shit Reggie
[4:42:54] <andre11dr> The worst is Rugal, he fights you in this fancy red suit but then he takes it off and for his sex clothes
[4:42:54] <dds333a> @j33p3r5_cr33p3r LUL
[4:43:15] <DSD24> @andre11dr That's why God Rugal is the best, he stays in the red suit the entire time
[4:43:23] <LordOfThePoultry> OOF
[4:43:28] <dds333a> @andre11dr exactly, phase one Rugal is suave and classy, but then he takes it off in phase two
[4:43:28] <gruulmagebeast> PAWNCH
[4:43:33] <BlackermanZX> ballsy
[4:43:38] <+polothegreatest> if you have kof14 gotta practice now for the next dlc  LUL

[4:44:20] <dds333a> @toptieramisu I feel this too, I wish she had the jacket, but she always gives it to Anton LUL
[4:44:21] <%townzzzzz> HE'S FEELING IT
[4:44:25] <dds333a> LUL LUL
[4:44:34] <DSD24> Not this time
[4:44:47] <+Chronor655> I miss Shen
[4:44:48] <+polothegreatest> LUL
[4:44:52] <andre11dr> Same problem with Krizalid, he looks badass with the feather coat but then he burn it off and looks like he's down with cbt
[4:45:09] <gruulmagebeast> yashiro is fun man its great going unga with him on my team and then they fight dolores and its the exact opposite LUL
[4:45:13] <dds333a> I like how Yashiro's victory is that he literally just does Sledgehammer
[4:45:23] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> Poor Reggie, like every match tonight has had a Ralf
[4:45:39] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> Man will be having trouble sleeping tonight
[4:45:39] <DSD24> @andre11dr I feel like most SNK bosses are down for cbt
[4:45:40] <gruulmagebeast> @J33P3R5_CR33P3R its prepping him for online : )
[4:45:59] <+Comb711> Vanessa feels like a character born from the dreams of house Madden
[4:46:09] <nintega010> it'll take practice woolie
[4:46:18] <dds333a> Literally
[4:46:42] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> @gruulmagebeast I haven’t played online yet but the thought that Ralf is the Scorpion of KOF scared me
[4:46:46] <andre11dr> They're really gonna keep playing on training stage huh?
[4:46:58] <+kewlmyc> @Comb711 Doesn't have enough muscle for that
[4:47:01] <+Chronor655> Lord Jimmy!
[4:47:06] <dds333a> LUL LUL
[4:47:10] <gruulmagebeast> ralf, krohnen, and mary seem to be the unga online characters so far
[4:47:44] <%Irridium> LUL
[4:47:47] <dds333a> DarkMode
[4:47:50] <%MutedMimic> woolieGASM
[4:48:06] <puluxor> can't get out brain
[4:48:09] <+zeoroot> So is Ralf a rush down character not to familiar with most of the kof characters mostly used Terry
[4:48:16] <+Comb711> Man When Geese DLC drops I'm gonna have to run into someone running Luong and Yamazaki
[4:48:21] <+Comb711> That's gonna be toxic
[4:48:21] <dds333a> @zeoroot kybrid kinda
[4:48:25] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> When I watched Max I saw a bunch of Angel’s but they were clearly winging it. I imagine a little after release she’ll be rarer once the horny status effect wears off
[4:48:29] <+elderpunch> why is she so THICK
[4:48:41] <andre11dr> @zeoroot pretty much, he also has a comand grab
[4:48:47] <+the22cstomp> a lot of horny picks are free wins right now
[4:48:48] <dds333a> Ralf is very aggressive, but he has spacing tools, and whatnot. can play good midrange
[4:48:55] <%Th3SmartAlec> @elderpunch not gonna lie she's stealing the show from Mai
[4:49:02] <+TopTieramisu> angel has way too many moves for the casual coomer
[4:49:04] <+thedream_c> Mary retained what made her dangerous in 14
[4:49:15] <+thedream_c> so i'm not surprised people just using her out of muscle memory from the previous game
[4:49:18] <DSD24> Leona is really cool too but hard to use cause of charge moves
[4:49:23] <%primarch_lupercal> reggie the shonen protagonist
[4:49:34] <+Comb711> Mary's CD's are war crime buttons
[4:49:44] <dds333a> Especially back in the day, when Leona had a STUFFED moveset LUL
[4:49:45] <zepelinnn1> bro charge moves were made to help begginers not do motions LUL
[4:49:48] <+TopTieramisu> finally, some kyo
[4:49:49] <SvenHolgersson> I remember SamSho octoSad
[4:49:55] <+thedream_c> Mary's magic 3x cr LK into stuff is still good on block due to pushback
[4:50:03] <%townzzzzz> cool bois
[4:50:07] <+the22cstomp> krohnen forgotten
[4:50:12] <dds333a> oh yeah these guys Kappa
[4:50:12] <andre11dr> KoF is the game to just play the poster boys because they're always top tier LUL
[4:50:21] <+TopTieramisu> i'd object to ryo being a cool boy
[4:50:22] <+thedream_c> Mai is actually very good
[4:50:30] <+thedream_c> but she loves meter for some big time punishes
[4:50:31] <BlackermanZX> that white and black Ryo is sick as hell
[4:50:32] <dds333a> Mai is often good
[4:50:43] <+polothegreatest> Use pink ryo LUL (dan)

[4:51:07] <dds333a> @andre11dr NASTY crossups LUL
[4:51:12] <andre11dr> K was also broken in early 13 and 14
[4:51:13] <+TopTieramisu> pat would like kula
[4:51:21] <+Chronor655> Dolores is bae
[4:51:33] <dds333a> @toptieramisu Kappa Kappa , indeed
[4:51:35] <+thedream_c> oh yeah the robert loop
[4:51:36] <JohnXuandou> Robert's was too easy, could start from literally anything, worked midscreen, was optimal for all meter usage
[4:51:44] <primaryfire> pat does like kula
[4:51:46] <+thedream_c> but there was a part of that robert loop that just needs to get tagged anyway
[4:51:54] <+TopTieramisu> pat has gingerdar
[4:51:57] <DSD24> Robert looks so cool though
[4:51:59] <+polothegreatest> i was surprised pat played kof plaguePog
[4:52:01] <DSD24> He pops the color
[4:52:06] <DSD24> collar
[4:52:07] <+thedream_c> hisotory mode or soemthing
[4:52:08] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> Nothing but muscley men, but I can work with that too
[4:52:23] <+thedream_c> until PC can get a mod to unlock the rest of the tunes
[4:52:24] <andre11dr> Pat likes gingers even when they don't stay gingers
[4:52:28] <dds333a> @polothegreatest probably more back then, really, but not as much as SF, obviously
[4:52:37] <+kewlmyc> K's so fucking cool. Reason I got into the series
[4:52:59] <dds333a> Minute spike is cool as hell, I get it
[4:53:05] <%RandoChris> K' has a cool moveset though I think he's a big dork stuck in his edgy phase and refuses to grow up lol
[4:53:06] <andre11dr> @kewlmyc He's also mad good so that helps
[4:53:36] <+CrimsonDio11> @RandoChris sounds like Dante
[4:53:42] <%RandoChris> HERE COMES THE BRICK SHITHOUSE RYO
[4:53:49] <dds333a> DWEEBENHEIMER
[4:53:56] <+kewlmyc> Yeah, him still being a brooding "too cool for school" edgy boi is pretty old at this point. Same with Kula being a braindead Ice Cream Gremlin.
[4:53:58] <skyshinecrusader> THICC RYO
[4:54:04] <+thedream_c> Ryo's a solid pick. Dunno if he's worth the meter spending tho
[4:54:08] <JohnXuandou> nope low parry is df.D in this one
[4:54:11] <+TopTieramisu> dante isn't really that edgy. that's more vergil's thing
[4:54:19] <+thedream_c> unless you really wanted that Ryo counter that costs meter
[4:54:22] <+TopTieramisu> dante's yucking it up
[4:54:26] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> Donte is edgy
[4:54:28] <maubpp> christ Ryo is such a beefcake in this game
[4:54:29] <peanutbutterroo> bootleg ryu
[4:54:33] <DSD24> I saw a picture comparing Ryo to a Goomba from the Super Mario Movie and it was cracking me up
[4:54:37] <+thedream_c> RIP Kyokugen
[4:54:43] <andre11dr> @kewlmyc Hey man his an a shiti clone of a cartel boss ,give him a brake
[4:54:43] <%slayabee> chop is 6A iirc
[4:54:46] <dds333a> KYOKUGENRYU OUGI failed
[4:54:55] <dds333a> No ORETA
[4:54:57] <+thedream_c> oh yeah guard point
[4:54:59] <+TopTieramisu> gotta love the autoguard
[4:55:00] <%RandoChris> Not that I want K' to be super friendly to everyone, at least tsundere K'
[4:55:13] <+thedream_c> ooohsuepr good now
[4:55:16] <dds333a> Moetaro
[4:55:22] <skyshinecrusader> Always respect Ryo for having the first super

[4:55:33] <+TopTieramisu> how
[4:55:34] <%townzzzzz> LUL
[4:55:37] <dds333a> LUL LUL LUL
[4:55:37] <+thedream_c> kyo can hold all his supers I thinK?
[4:55:38] <%Irridium> LUL
[4:55:39] <+kewlmyc> Why would you walk into that?
[4:55:41] <+thedream_c> level 1 I think
[4:55:44] <%RandoChris> THAT'S LIKE GETTING GET BY FULLY CHARGED DENJIN HADOKEN
[4:55:47] <karismaticprik> mind games!
[4:55:48] <skyshinecrusader> LUL
[4:55:55] <+Mordexai_> just came in. did anyone play krohnen?
[4:55:57] <+TopTieramisu> i'm guessing they haven't really labbed with kyo LUL
[4:56:01] <dds333a> Orochinagi hype????
[4:56:06] <andre11dr> I like that K is super cool even tho he's powers suck ass because his fire is the weakest but hurts him the most
[4:56:14] <+thedream_c> kyo j2C always a classic
[4:56:14] <+TopTieramisu> mushiki is kyo's best DM
[4:56:21] <+TopTieramisu> wish they'd bring it back
[4:56:46] <JohnXuandou> they only overlap if your execution is bad jiyuFist
[4:56:51] <dds333a> LUL
[4:57:14] <dds333a> I don't think that's new?
[4:57:31] <andre11dr> Wasn't that in 14?
[4:57:36] <JohnXuandou> it was in XIV
[4:57:47] <dds333a> Recent, yeah, tho
[4:57:48] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:57:49] <+thedream_c> its okay. Not many played enough 14 to know
[4:58:01] <JohnXuandou> half of this game is explaining to people what was in XIV for most people lol
[4:58:01] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> If we’re talking about character personalities, I find it nuts that Khronen is still obsessed with beating K even though he’s no longer a NEST member
[4:58:04] <dds333a> Different from his legacy moveset
[4:58:14] <+zeoroot> Never played K9999 but krohnen uses his move set right
[4:58:20] <%RandoChris> Yeah
[4:58:22] <+TopTieramisu> bring back ryo's other fighting stance
[4:58:37] <th3_gaming_dumb> he has An extension out of second Shell EX btw pressing back c
[4:58:38] <+TopTieramisu> don't know why they had to go back to the old aof pose
[4:58:39] <andre11dr> I never brought 14 but I've watched some 14 ,
[4:58:40] <dds333a> @toptieramisu I cry :(
[4:58:47] <Idon__> Cut Ryo, give us Mr. Karate II.
[4:58:48] <th3_gaming_dumb> back B sorry
[4:59:08] <andre11dr> That game is pretty fun to watch at high levels
[5:00:19] <%RandoChris> Considering the sprites for KOF 12 and 13 were done in 3D first before sprites were drawn, I think AOF pose was easier for them to do @TopTieramisu
[5:00:30] <xerotwo> Party mode when? LUL
[5:00:33] <andre11dr> It's wierd to see Kyo but no kick loops in the corner
[5:00:34] <+thedream_c> oh yeah Whip is nice in this version
[5:00:35] <GraceAccent> yo lets go joe
[5:00:36] <dds333a> I wish I had a Maxima too LUL
[5:00:43] <+TopTieramisu> @RandoChris that's the thing though. ryo should have never gone back to the aof pose
[5:00:47] <+thedream_c> tho some whip mains said she got nerfed in XV from 14
[5:00:56] <xerotwo> TROY AIKMAN!!!

[5:01:16] <skyshinecrusader> ANDYYY
[5:01:18] <+thedream_c> Andy has uses
[5:01:18] <dds333a> I love the eye poke champion
[5:01:32] <+thedream_c> at least Andy doesn't look emaciated now
[5:01:38] <%RandoChris> Considering his palette in-game was AOF1 Ryo also, the hands out pose wouldn't have fit.
[5:01:47] <$ggbhtg> TROY AIKMEN
[5:01:49] <+TopTieramisu> i bet you the modelers worked on andy first after all those memes
[5:01:52] <xerotwo> TROY AIKMAN!!!

[5:03:02] <Diepodlives> A lot of the effects in this game are odd to me
[5:03:05] <+Jack8274> That is disgusting
[5:03:05] <+thedream_c> Muay Thai match
[5:03:07] <%townzzzzz> hitting you with the drinks from her bar

[5:11:47] <+saltpiggu> he's literally a mdel
[5:11:49] <Wofoeh> Guess I'll shut the fuck up then

[5:12:22] <Wofoeh> What if Jean Pieere polnareff had Red hot Chili peppers instead of Silver chariot?
[5:12:23] <%RandoChris> Beni has no spin kicks
[5:12:24] <JohnXuandou> spin kicks gone
[5:12:27] <dds333a> RAIKOKEN
[5:12:34] <+TopTieramisu> maxima really does look like a gaming mouse
[5:12:37] <andre11dr> No spin kick
[5:12:37] <dds333a> Yeah, no triangle kick
[5:12:39] <+kewlmyc> F
[5:12:45] <RaiNiMayonnaise> He hasnt had them for a while
[5:12:56] <dds333a> Hadan souten geri LUL
[5:12:57] <JohnXuandou> Maxima is Wolverine
[5:13:00] <andre11dr> He hasn't had it since 13 man
[5:13:01] <+thedream_c> see KOF taking people from different parts of the world
[5:13:11] <LLCoolZJ> Benimaru without the spin kick is like Ken without a shoryuken.
[5:13:16] <+thedream_c> i mean he didn't have it in 14
[5:13:19] <dds333a> earlier
[5:13:21] <%RandoChris> Maxima representing Canada with them muttonchops
[5:13:28] <+thedream_c> but that still didn't stop him from being strong in 14
[5:13:31] <+thedream_c> until they nerfed him then
[5:13:51] <WeepyDevil> meitenkun makes me think of komugi from hxh
[5:13:54] <dds333a> That was a large reason why people hates XIII, not in Beni's case (much) but many characters had their move sets GUTTED
[5:13:59] <WeepyDevil> not enough snot tho lol
[5:14:18] <+TopTieramisu> if komugi was like meitenkun, meruem would have already destroyed humanity
[5:14:18] <+thedream_c> whip zoning
[5:14:22] <+thedream_c> welp
[5:14:29] <dds333a> @thedream_c yeah, and Beni still keeps the tradition of being top tier LUL

[5:14:31] <BlackermanZX> Narcolepsy kid is pretty good in XV
[5:14:32] <andre11dr> @dds333a People don't really hate 13 tho
[5:14:47] <dds333a> @andre11dr you'd be surprised
[5:14:47] <+thedream_c> meitenkun was slept on 14 too
[5:14:53] <andre11dr> @dds333a 13 is the feeling KoF hands down

[5:15:02] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> @thedream_c LUL
[5:15:07] <dds333a> People despised it when it came down, and plenty still hate it.
[5:15:12] <JohnXuandou> 13 is not the most loved among long time KoF fans, it was mostly bigger with more casual fans
[5:15:14] <skyshinecrusader> LUL
[5:15:20] <dds333a> I don't, but people do hate it
[5:15:28] <JohnXuandou> I hate it I can be that guy here
[5:15:31] <%RandoChris> Robert right out of a business meeting
[5:15:38] <dds333a> IKKIMASE
[5:15:46] <+the22cstomp> 13 is loved most by people who dont play kof
[5:15:48] <andre11dr> @dds333a Most of those people are die hards that will be playing 2002 forever anyway
[5:15:50] <+heyitsdenzel_> Oh shit its Robert from King Of Fighters
[5:15:57] <$razielhex> SHERMIE TIME
[5:16:00] <+thedream_c> oh shit indeed
[5:16:03] <+kewlmyc> That Sleepy boi DP is disgusting.
[5:16:04] <Wofoeh> Heard Sleepy boi is pretty good in this game
[5:16:04] <+thedream_c> SHERMIE WITH A DUMPY
[5:16:06] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> Robert out here earning that Yussy
[5:16:12] <dds333a> @andre11dr be that as it may, doesn't change the fact
[5:16:15] <+the22cstomp> meiten is indeed OD
[5:16:20] <%RandoChris> Shermie bringing in the dump truck for chat

[5:16:44] <andre11dr> @dds333a And I'm someone who actually got good at 2002 back in the day, like I'm not godlike but i can hold my own
[5:17:00] <%Th3SmartAlec> "How wide can we make Shermie's hips?" "Let's find out"
[5:17:05] <+thedream_c> sno man has uses
[5:17:10] <+thedream_c> kula is good to use in this game too
[5:17:16] <+thedream_c> good tools, good confirms
[5:17:16] <dds333a> Miss Diamond
[5:17:30] <dds333a> Also, yeah, Meitenkun is GREAT
[5:17:42] <andre11dr> Is.....Kula a good?
[5:17:56] <JohnXuandou> Kula is usually always good
[5:17:58] <andre11dr> Like i don't hate her but i don't love her
[5:17:59] <+heyitsdenzel_> kula is cool. literally cool
[5:18:08] <JohnXuandou> Kula and K' are rarely bad
[5:18:11] <+thedream_c> Kula got beefed in 14
[5:18:11] <+kewlmyc> When is Kula not good? Legit question
[5:18:18] <andre11dr> Tho if she never came back again i wouldn't miss her
[5:18:23] <JohnXuandou> she was very mid in XIII console
[5:18:27] <+thedream_c> K' did get nerfed in 14 but he was still very good
[5:18:34] <Wofoeh> Chat, what are your personal hopes for returning characters?
[5:18:40] <+thedream_c> Duck King
[5:18:46] <dds333a> LUL LUL
[5:18:48] <+TopTieramisu> kula is unfortunately quite a brand within kof
[5:18:48] <andre11dr> @wofoeh Rugal
[5:18:53] <%SirGO0SE> God this stage rules
[5:18:53] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1493839904186503170?t=YO4iMpiXtS4ChklGkEnM1Q&s=19
[5:18:54] <+TopTieramisu> she's in a lot of cross promotional stuff
[5:18:57] <dds333a> into slide for the mixup
[5:19:05] <+thedream_c> yeah Kula is a mascot
[5:19:08] <+thedream_c> its Kula from DOA6
[5:19:10] <+thedream_c> along with MAI
[5:19:23] <+thedream_c> I can't wait for them to take on Geese from Tekken 7 coming in May as DLC
[5:19:26] <Wofoeh> I hope for Chang, Shen, and Franco Bash
[5:19:31] <BlackermanZX> my personal DLC picks are Rugal, Adelheid, Shen and Duo Lon
[5:19:37] <LLCoolZJ> They didn't have to makes Delores sand stand a Little Guy.
[5:19:44] <dds333a> BYE BYE
[5:20:06] <Wofoeh> But Chang with Choi in his moveset, like he was in CVS2
[5:20:07] <andre11dr> @thedream_c Wait what, i thought Geese was from CVS2
[5:20:16] <+thedream_c> Nah Nakoruru is from CVS2
[5:20:17] <+zeoroot> So the orochi versions of Yashiro, Chris and Shermi just had some extra moves added to them or did they also get there stats tweaked as well?
[5:20:28] <LLCoolZJ> I've never liked Vanessa in this sandals.
[5:20:32] <dds333a> @zeoroot as in orginally?
[5:20:35] <+thedream_c> orochi versions of the CYS team play differently
[5:20:39] <+polothegreatest> Different moves
[5:20:43] <+zeoroot> yeah
[5:20:46] <dds333a> If so, yeah, they're essentially different characters
[5:20:53] <+heyitsdenzel_> snowman pressure too strong
[5:20:56] <+kewlmyc> Kula sweep
[5:20:57] <+MyshkaMysh> OCV!

[5:21:20] <+thedream_c> I liek Kula

[5:21:25] <andre11dr> Ok so I'm not the only one
[5:21:31] <+kewlmyc> Kula's great, though her personality is annoying
[5:21:37] <+thedream_c> did you know Iori is also a popular mascot too? He appeared in Milion Arthur Arcaana Blood
[5:21:38] <+conqab> she's a main-stay now, regardless
[5:21:39] <BlackermanZX> Woolie is seething while gettin Kula ocv
[5:21:45] <andre11dr> I mean i don't hate her but i don't like her either
[5:21:47] <xerotwo> Tell us how you REALLY feel, WOOLIE LUL
[5:21:47] <dds333a> Woolz has voiced his displeasure in the past Kappa
[5:21:54] <Rickbane> this new SNK Heroines game looks lit
[5:21:55] <%townzzzzz> woolie only likes the cool youth like sin and rock LUL
[5:22:04] <+thedream_c> Kula had funny costumes in Heroines
[5:22:08] <+thedream_c> maybe we'll see em in XV one day
[5:22:15] <dds333a> @townzzzzz LUL Based
[5:22:25] <+zeoroot> So orochi Yashiro is endless grabs then from what I observed
[5:22:29] <+thedream_c> but Kula had more costumes in DOA6
[5:22:35] <andre11dr> Tho this particular Kula design is very meh ,i like her 2000 version way more
[5:22:42] <+TopTieramisu> i love orochi yashiro
[5:22:48] <dds333a> My favorite Kula costume in Heroines is where she's forced to dress as Ángel, since they dont like each other LUL
[5:22:48] <+kewlmyc> Woolie is dying inside

[5:23:09] <%Th3SmartAlec> Kula heard ya talking shit
[5:23:13] <+saltpiggu> i can feel the salt from here
[5:23:13] <dds333a> @zeoroot yes, O. Yashiro is a dark version of Daimon
[5:23:15] <+thedream_c> yeah the nests team in 14 and 15 are kinda touch and go. They don't make too much sense
[5:23:21] <BlackermanZX> Woolz you should try blocking woolieFROG
[5:23:30] <+thedream_c> well Angel was in team Mexico so that made all the sesne
[5:23:43] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> SeemsGood1000 I got my panicked Reggie screams from Galactica and although I didn’t get the Angel Climax humiliation, I’ll accept those 2 People’s Elbows. Stream is now officially 10/10, good job guys.
[5:23:43] <dds333a> Becomes a pure grappler, with a frankly horrifying approach game
[5:23:47] <+elderpunch> OOF

[5:23:52] <BlackermanZX> gawd damn

[5:24:04] <+zanz_san> ooooofffffff
[5:24:06] <dds333a> O. Yashiro has this running grab that is just nerve wracking
[5:24:07] <xerotwo> Woolie does not like Ice Gremlin LUL
[5:24:14] <andre11dr> Oh speaking of Nests ,why has Roxie never came back? she was cool
[5:24:21] <+TopTieramisu> i definitely expect vice and mature to be back
[5:24:22] <dds333a> @toptieramisu yes exactly, easy to avoid, but so scary
[5:24:36] <+kewlmyc> LA LA LA
[5:24:46] <+thedream_c> who knows. Pouplarity maybe. Sylvie may be the last compelling NESTs char
[5:24:48] <BlackermanZX> Reggie should main Kula out of spite
[5:24:49] <JohnXuandou> everyone has a stand A
[5:24:50] <+jacqueblacqued> That pressure is craaazyyy
[5:24:51] <+thedream_c> even tho I wasn't a huge fan of Sylvie
[5:25:09] <JohnXuandou> stand A is the universal hop check
[5:25:26] <%TheQuadrupleS> Reggie out here takin notes
[5:25:30] <+thedream_c> yeah
[5:25:33] <+jacqueblacqued> Dino with the TIMBS
[5:25:33] <andre11dr> Reggie taking notes
[5:25:34] <+thedream_c> some Jump ins just damn too good
[5:25:40] <+thedream_c> can't win ground AA every time
[5:25:45] <+thedream_c> this isn't SF
[5:25:48] <+polothegreatest> I wonder how O. Versions would play using their Supers to climax cancels
[5:26:00] <andre11dr> He's totally gonna main Kula to get into Woolies head
[5:26:00] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[5:26:01] <dds333a> when in doubt, roll LUL
[5:26:11] <nintega010> stand a is when there hopping close
[5:26:12] <dds333a> If only that were always the case
[5:26:13] <+thedream_c> sometimes you have to play the air to air game
[5:26:17] <+TopTieramisu> orochi shermie's probably my least favorite of the orochi trio
[5:26:23] <BlackermanZX> Kula has some crazy pressure
[5:26:46] <+thedream_c> Reggie was trained well with the jump offense from smash
[5:26:59] <andre11dr> @toptieramisu Cool looking but the moveset is meh
[5:27:06] <dds333a> @toptieramisu the only thing I like about her is her deceptive projectile, and HSDM, the original one. her hand swipe move sucks, despite the damage
[5:27:11] <+kewlmyc> SHE'S DEAD
[5:27:13] <+MyshkaMysh> \o/
[5:27:15] <%slayabee> The evil is dead
[5:27:22] <Hammatime8> SHE'S FINALLY DEAD
[5:27:24] <+zeoroot> So does king of dinosaurs have any of tizochs move set or is it completely new?
[5:27:25] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> Reggie apparently a secret Kula main
[5:27:29] <PFlare> How to play Clark: Run at people and grab.
[5:27:33] <Wofoeh> AREA INDUSTRIAL FOR THE BOIS?
[5:27:33] <andre11dr> Orochi Chris is probably the best one moveset wise
[5:27:37] <dds333a> @zeoroot he has a few
[5:27:42] <+kewlmyc> That's Jimmy Bones playing Kula I think
[5:27:42] <LLCoolZJ> Hey!
[5:27:45] <Hammatime8> These next rounds barely mean shit anymore, Kula dying was a big W
[5:27:55] <+thedream_c> CLARKinator

[5:29:07] <+Your_Lord_and_Senpai> psycho ball
[5:29:20] <+thedream_c> Reggie should try Blue mary I think
[5:29:54] <+RhymesWithWasabi> is her EX command grab good to get people off?
[5:30:09] <andre11dr> I don't think Reggie would like Mary she's a wierd grappler
[5:30:10] <+thedream_c> yeah there is no universal answer to short hop pressuree
[5:30:20] <+TopTieramisu> mary has one grapple move
[5:30:21] <dds333a> TELEPORT
[5:30:30] <andre11dr> Like you have to taunt to grab people
[5:30:30] <+TopTieramisu> her gameplay isn't very grapplery
[5:30:56] <+TopTieramisu> i mean, it's way better than a taunt
[5:31:19] <+thedream_c> well in 14 mary seems to have a more streamlined offense
[5:31:19] <BlackermanZX> Vanessa can pop off with meter tbf
[5:31:28] <dds333a> my favorite thing about Mary is how many tricks she has to keep the opponent careful
[5:31:31] <andre11dr> @toptieramisu I know but it looks like a taunt ,what else should i call it
[5:31:40] <+thedream_c> yeah mary's jump angles with her air attacks are NASTY
[5:31:43] <PFlare> Oof, he should've been de- there we go.
[5:31:44] <Tunamanguy> nice
[5:32:01] <+thedream_c> which isw hat makes Mary pretty brutal if you aren't used to seeing her jump at you
[5:32:16] <PFlare> Vanessa with 2 bars can rip off 60% of your life.
[5:32:24] <LLCoolZJ> what are you doing step bro

[5:32:41] <dds333a> They found the reflection
[5:32:42] <spinbel> He just shouldn't say it.
[5:32:44] <BlackermanZX> ...well he aint wrong LUL
[5:32:45] <Ragnorok64> pause?
[5:32:46] <+thedream_c> Woolie needs his satisfaction
[5:32:51] <dds333a> silence
[5:32:53] <Diepodlives> I think his 11 look is the best
[5:32:55] <+thedream_c> between punch moms and his Ashe muscle memory
[5:32:56] <+polothegreatest> plagueCringe
[5:32:58] <+TopTieramisu> i like the new coat for ash
[5:33:19] <%slayabee> ROUND START 5D goddamn woolz
[5:33:19] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[5:33:37] <+thedream_c> no punish on the galactica either
[5:33:38] <+the22cstomp> @slayabee you dont understand how godlike ralf's 5D in this game is
[5:33:50] <+thedream_c> looks like Reggie has gotten that out of his head
[5:33:58] <dds333a> @thedream_c LUL LUL
[5:34:05] <+TopTieramisu> no longer haunted by galactica phantom
[5:34:11] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> @thedream_c The ptsd is too strong
[5:34:16] <dds333a> Will Reg overcome his fear with the latest kof game? LUL
[5:34:23] <andre11dr> Dude i need, NEED Shen Woo in this game
[5:34:31] <%slayabee> @the22cstomp No I really do that's why I reacted like that lol just throw that shit out fuck you gonna do?
[5:34:47] <dds333a> He sure did
[5:34:51] <+the22cstomp> perish most likely
[5:34:55] <+thedream_c> yeah Ralf is an esports character
[5:34:58] <+thedream_c> with an esports button
[5:35:20] <+thedream_c> I don't fault anyone drawn to him in XV
[5:35:30] <andre11dr> It's wierd they brought back Ash but no Shen and no Oswald
[5:35:39] <dds333a> It helps that Ralf has ALWAYS been cool
[5:35:49] <PFlare> MAX mode is essentially a Roman Cancel with some extra perks, right?
[5:35:54] <RaiNiMayonnaise> Kukri is weak on defense. Its hard to do anything when you rush him down
[5:35:56] <%slayabee> @andre11dr Oswald was in 14
[5:36:04] <+thedream_c> Oswald will be back I figure. Most of 14 DLC made it back in some way
[5:36:15] <%slayabee> Amd Shen is in Ash's ending (spoilers)
[5:36:28] <dds333a> GO TO HEAVEN
[5:36:33] <+thedream_c> WOW
[5:36:33] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> Honestly it’s likely with how strong and popular Ralf is, I wouldn’t be surprised if he was next to get a nerf

[5:41:15] <+kewlmyc> Unless you play other games. Feb is hell month
[5:41:23] <+MyshkaMysh> Marco and Mars Peeps for DLC!
[5:41:24] <@Solidus_113> Coat Android 21 is coming out on the 24th in FighterZ
[5:41:25] <+darkfoxxs> Some pinputs tho WHEW
[5:41:42] <andre11dr> Depends on how interesting the dlc is
[5:41:46] <dds333a> A lot of the things people recognize
[5:41:51] <jotabranded> in North America...
[5:41:56] <+saltpiggu> not in south America
[5:42:05] <dds333a> But it has always occupies that slot, but not where I'm from LUL
[5:42:11] <+polothegreatest> Latam mostly
[5:42:13] <+kewlmyc> KOF is always poverty in NA. It's poppin in SA
[5:42:14] <+MyshkaMysh> Hispanic  Law requires you favor KoD.
[5:42:19] <%SirGO0SE> theres PLENTY of room for KOF
[5:42:21] <+OrangeMDT> In NA, Woolie
[5:42:28] <+MyshkaMysh> KoF*
[5:42:33] <andre11dr> Well you are in Montreal, that's as far from Mexico as you get
[5:42:38] <SaiyanShoto> The online of this game still needs a bit of work
[5:42:38] <+kewlmyc> It's big in Korea as well
[5:42:47] <RaiNiMayonnaise> More people are giving it a shot than ever
[5:42:55] <andre11dr> It's big in Korea and China
[5:43:00] <+polothegreatest> yup
[5:43:06] <dds333a> 02 UM, nonstop
[5:43:10] <xerotwo> a lot of the JP players are on that shit
[5:43:11] <andre11dr> China is going ape shit on this
[5:43:33] <+Inverse_Girth> Min looks a little different
[5:43:38] <+LastHazzerd> the people who liked 14 loved 14
[5:43:54] <+LastHazzerd> the people who stayed with 14 loved 14
[5:43:55] <dds333a> Kappa Kappa LUL
[5:44:04] <+polothegreatest> Original 14 kyo LUL
[5:44:06] <+kewlmyc> XIV looked like shit so a lot of people just wrote it off
[5:44:10] <andre11dr> Nah 14 was like MVCI the game was good but a bunch of people hate it because it looked like shit
[5:44:11] <+Jiggisnipe> 12 bad 13 good 14 meh 15 probably good
[5:44:30] <+Jiggisnipe> @andre11dr exactly
[5:44:36] <dds333a> Better than MVC: I too, in fact, it was absolutely solid
[5:44:40] <@Solidus_113> I'm just gonna keep my eyes on Strive, TFH, and Skullgirls
[5:44:43] <%GinAndRoses> i sure hope so
[5:44:52] <Samurai_Jake> 14 Kyo was a egghead, mo-howard lookin sumbitch
[5:44:55] <%SirGO0SE> and then the DLC comes out and youre back in LUL
[5:44:57] <jotabranded> KoF and MK are the most popular here in Brazil
[5:45:03] <+CrimsonDio11> the execution barrier I think will KOF's biggest downfall
[5:45:03] <BlackermanZX> this between Strive and DNF
[5:45:06] <$ggbhtg> I guess the elephant is "Will people return after Elden Ring?"
[5:45:06] <BlackermanZX> gawd damn
[5:45:12] <%SirGO0SE> you best believe Geese gonna move copies
[5:45:28] <+BunGunArt> I'm pretty much a casual and I've fallen in love with KOF lol
[5:45:32] <dds333a> Has happened rarely with some games, I'm still ALL IN on '02, but that's it
[5:45:45] <+kewlmyc> It's pretty as fuck
[5:45:50] <andre11dr> Some people just are drawn to certain games ,i for one don't give a shit about Skullgirls
[5:46:01] <%SirGO0SE> Strive is my first GG and I've played it more than any fighting game since SF4
[5:46:11] <andre11dr> But i know and respect that a lot of people love it
[5:46:17] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> Saw a bunch of those for KOF tonight
[5:46:17] <+darkfoxxs> The skill floor
[5:46:21] <BlackermanZX> I mean KOF is bigger than anything else in some countries
[5:46:42] <IgnusSTV> Yesterday KoFXV got 8,226 online players on Steam.
[5:46:57] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> And then Kotal jobbed and you changed games LUL
[5:47:04] <+saltpiggu> I miss 13 sprites
[5:47:05] <+kewlmyc> @IgnusSTV Which is less than what Melty Blood had, which is pretty damning
[5:47:11] <dds333a> Duo Lon and King everywhere LUL
[5:47:14] <andre11dr> People STILL play 13
[5:47:16] <%AlteisenReiseZ> JIMMYBONES THAT IS THE CORRECT SET
[5:47:26] <RaiNiMayonnaise> Apparently tokido was playing 15 at some point

[5:47:58] <BlackermanZX> yeah... LUL
[5:48:00] <%SirGO0SE> what, you want an ingame movie?
[5:48:03] <+BunGunArt> There's a bit of a stain on KOF for casuals because of difficulty, but honestly I find it easier to understand than most other fighters because of universal combo structure. You know, that thing they took out of Guilty Gear.
[5:48:10] <%townzzzzz> I still want M.O.M mode back
[5:48:13] <+kewlmyc> GG came with a full season of anime
[5:48:13] <dds333a> exactly
[5:48:17] <IgnusSTV> Got to sell single player content for the casuals.
[5:48:17] <@Solidus_113> Granblue had a whole RPG
[5:48:27] <dds333a> If you got good online, well shit
[5:48:28] <%J33P3R5_CR33P3R> I want a weapon master-sequel mode in my fighting games

[5:48:54] <+saltpiggu> Samsho 2 will be huge tho
[5:49:08] <+polothegreatest> Haomaru theme plagueHarkness
[5:49:22] <SaiyanShoto> If only SamSho had good online
[5:49:22] <andre11dr> Smasho had had terrible online and way less hype than this
[5:49:31] <xerotwo> I hope to see a KOF party mode stream sometime LUL
[5:49:31] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
