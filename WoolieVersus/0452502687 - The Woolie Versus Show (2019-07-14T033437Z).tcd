[0:20:09] <theobble> i'm happier not knowing
[0:20:10] <The_Swedish_X> Apparently that might also be bullshit?

[0:20:27] <%faytthepally> FUTURE PROOF LUL
[0:20:28] <thepiefoot> They have no money or time tho
[0:20:30] <+ImpHelpSingIt> @Kurt_0 wubbyExcite
[0:20:31] <+QuadraticGravity> sorry i have to watch later, Mothman almost beat Cerberus
[0:20:32] <Djinnazz> Carl Pinkerton?

[0:20:33] <Yaganel> Play YOKAI watch
[0:20:33] <@Menitta> ITS JUST AS SHITTY
[0:20:35] <reonome> i think the article was a lie but nobody is sure
[0:20:35] <thepiefoot> Animations are hard, guys
[0:20:36] <%FuqBoiSlim> why does the model look exactly the same then????
[0:20:37] <$cherubs_anonymous> You mean YOU, Pat
[0:20:38] <@Menitta> ITS THE SAME 1:1
[0:20:41] <%gigacanuck> For fuck's sake Game Freak, just hire more staff.
[0:20:41] <TheBlankAce> Some of that is a lie, the animations could be kept but the models are iffy
[0:20:42] <AMajorTom> They were using Maya, and we couldn't figure out how to make it work
[0:20:44] <Psyramics> this is the dumbest shit! This isn't a 'rebuild everything' problem, this is a 'fix your fucking tools' problem
[0:20:44] <Prevot> they have to re-animate it and it all looks the fucking same NotLikeThis
[0:20:45] <%RyTYoung> surely it's bettee it gets pushed back so it can please fans
[0:20:46] <zeroraider> They are just THAT bad
[0:20:51] <%ImperiusMex> ImperiusMex subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! Another month! Hope to see ya at Evo dood!
[0:20:51] <DianaTheAscian> its still shit though
[0:21:00] <+C24U> Okay, if they had said it from the start this wouldn't have been so bad about the limitation
[0:21:03] <+Taglog7> just crunchies Kappa
[0:21:04] <@Menitta> THEY CANT BECAUSE THE SHIT ANIME
[0:21:06] <+Darren716> Woolie they cant
[0:21:06] <alcors_wisdom> its not okay at this point
[0:21:06] <+cvp5127> cant wait for mechanics to be ditched next gen
[0:21:11] <majima666> last pokemon game i properly played was soul silver
[0:21:11] <%RyTYoung> exactly
[0:21:16] <%SuckerPunchSyd> oof
[0:21:17] <aeonicvector> YUP
[0:21:18] <xvstheworld> I'll be the rooooundabout~
[0:21:19] <Spagheddies> Y'all will wait, but them investors are picky eaters.
[0:21:19] <@Menitta> God I'm so fucking vexed about this
[0:21:21] <AirlineFood74> The animation are still super trash garbage
[0:21:22] <%Dr00_PhD> WE will wait. The rest of the world won't
[0:21:22] <%gigacanuck> @Menitta WHICH IS WHY THEY SHOULD HIRE MORE STAFF
[0:21:23] <The_Swedish_X> Really the article (real or fake) still doesn't help Gamefreak's situation in any way.
[0:21:23] <alcors_wisdom> they have a fucking GLOBAL release of all the toys and merch and fucking anime bullshit
[0:21:23] <Ion_Laser> Just delay the game. It's a Pokemon game. It will make money
[0:21:25] <+crimsonharvest> They have duplicated the work of making the actual pokemon by like 4 or five times now without anything to show for it.
[0:21:25] <JustTaven> I fuckin remember and I'm fucking miffed as hell.
[0:21:26] <%faytthepally> @woolieversus the anime screwed them
[0:21:28] <@Menitta> YES
[0:21:28] <thepiefoot> IAMGAMES has a great vid on it, with a very pausible theory. But it's just a theory
[0:21:30] <@Menitta> NotLikeThis
[0:21:35] <prime_name> BUY CYBER SLEUTH
[0:21:38] <%QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus “A delayed game is eventually good, a bad game is bad forever" says man refusing to allow Pokemon to be delayed
[0:21:39] <ExpressNode> High quality A-poses
[0:21:40] <zeroraider> product cannot wait wooloo!
[0:21:40] <+Vijuani> anyways, go play that bootleg
[0:21:41] <%FuqBoiSlim> We put up with 15fps pokemon battles for 6 years for NOTHING
[0:21:41] <+Kurt_0> Mind freak
[0:21:42] <+cvp5127> yo go buy cyber sleuth
[0:21:43] <@Menitta> Its been shit since the 3DS
[0:21:44] <DeoxysPrime> Pokemon isn't a game, it's a media franchise
[0:21:45] <FirewallStorm> yes
[0:21:45] <Astar_NoName> I actually like X and Y compared to Sun and Moon
[0:21:45] <Sphincter_Spelunker> It always did
[0:21:46] <The_Swedish_X> Stagnent as fuck
[0:21:46] <xmetalicdemonx> yes
[0:21:47] <%gigacanuck> @crimsonharvest but have they gotten exceedingly efficient at it?
[0:21:47] <Spagheddies> Cyber Sleuth is good shit.
[0:21:48] <$cureneckbeard> They can't import Pokemon from other regions because of Brexit
[0:21:51] <+HellCopter> No it'll be fine. Just not as great as we'd hope.
[0:21:51] <majima666> i keep on meaning to go through black and white but i keep on getting sidetracked
[0:21:51] <@Menitta> No it's been bad for almost a decade now
[0:21:52] <MyNameIsRasus> Yes
[0:21:52] <Prevot> there is also a very unfavorable comparison to Dragon Quest 11
[0:21:53] <JustTaven> The gameplay? it's solid. Models? FUCK YES IT DOES.
[0:21:54] <Sphincter_Spelunker> IT'S ABOUT COLLECTING.
[0:21:54] <Djinnazz> it's been the same game for 20 years.
[0:21:55] <+Pyr0_Fr0st> Digimon wins again
[0:21:57] <Snookasaurus> botched since X and Y
[0:21:58] <aeonicvector> Pokemon dead, long live 3rd party pokemmos and Digimon
[0:21:59] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Let's take that away
[0:21:59] <AirlineFood74> DIGI TAMERS RISE UP
[0:22:01] <+Kurt_0> Yuup
[0:22:02] <zenith0111> It always sucked ass
[0:22:03] <TurtlePyramid> Cyber Sleuth is coming to the switch
[0:22:03] <marvel877> no shit
[0:22:04] <joshua_42> SMT is a better game
[0:22:04] <+Mothman742> DIGIMON NOW KING
[0:22:06] <%GohanEgret> @QueequegTheater not really up to miyamoto, also star fox zero was still wack even with a delay
[0:22:06] <tetrabrick1lt> GOTTA B E
[0:22:06] <shiny_prinny> pokemon has continuously gotten worse
[0:22:07] <TheBlankAce> Pokemon no, everything around it maybe
[0:22:08] <Daba_mk2> Cyber Sleuth is cool
[0:22:08] <$cureneckbeard> Pokemon always sucked
[0:22:08] <alcors_wisdom> @Pyr0_Fr0st when was the last game fucker
[0:22:10] <KassTheLass> Cyber sleuth collection is coming out on switch, give it a look if you like Persona rip offs
[0:22:10] <gustavozxd> I thought I got here late but they're still talking, nice
[0:22:11] <tetrabrick1lt> THE VERY BEST
[0:22:11] <%faytthepally> @queequegtheater Shiggy doesn't make Pokemon to be fair.
[0:22:12] <neverforget2018> @WoolieVersus change the title to Castle Super Beat semi-Podcast
[0:22:12] <Prevot> gens 4, 6 and now 8 were botches
[0:22:13] <+anibrius> lirikK
[0:22:14] <%FuqBoiSlim> Pokemon hasn't been hitting since 2012 to be quite honest with you y'all
[0:22:14] <+mobius_won> Bw2 was the end of good pokemon
[0:22:15] <+CJett92> I've been on and off for the last 10 years, its not great
[0:22:17] <%RyTYoung> It's just such a stagnant series that never changes
[0:22:21] <worldbrand> I would call it consistently better than the sum of its parts, but boy are those parts getting worse and worse
[0:22:22] <wohdin> pirate master race
[0:22:23] <Kghaleon> People relieved that Woolie is finally finishing RE2's Leon run, while Nier fans continue to wait for eternity.

[0:45:32] <dreu81> Close the lid when you flush pat jeez
[0:45:33] <Junkfist> If you take your playstation into the bathroom and scream at it it'll work.
[0:45:33] <%Double_Tap_That> wooliePOYO
[0:45:33] <+Antoids> the software
[0:45:33] <scrumbotime> ok, this is the point where it gets crazy

[0:45:41] <+mkenney24> i'm learning so much tonight
[0:45:41] <hamsterdavidson> Woolie is doing a great job blocking all of this Pat-rant
[0:45:42] <joshua_42> Why would wear clothing in the bathroom
[0:45:42] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Woolie just turn off the stream to fix it. You’re only giving Pat power.
[0:45:42] <AlexStAdams> pat: always ready for butt stuff
[0:45:43] <+Darren716> What the actual fuck pat?
[0:45:43] <happyface699> Exactly
[0:45:44] <vingadivo> i do that unironically
[0:45:44] <CptBritches> Do you hold the toilet paper out away from the toilet the whole time like an idiot too?
[0:45:44] <Jammho> Make the bad man stop wooly
[0:45:44] <+Nomicro4u> By that logic Piss and Poo particles are in your lungs if you breath in the bathroom
[0:45:46] <alrobot2014> but pat the particles will spread throughout the room if you do that
[0:45:46] <%Kavtech> I DO THAT
[0:45:47] <worldbrand> I incinerate my clothes
[0:45:48] <+BopBeep> It's been an hour...
[0:45:48] <Sphincter_Spelunker> shower with poop gas
[0:45:49] <+AtomicHeartSon> this is the most wasteful
[0:45:50] <HitchhikingThrough> Pat is full of shit, we've seen him go to the bathroom on the podcast
[0:45:51] <fuji_92> Pat's right
[0:45:52] <+stagemage> Most recent trop[hy A Great Need for a Shower
[0:45:52] <%FuqBoiSlim> What made you like this
[0:45:53] <+linSP> You ingest poop particles everytime you fart
[0:45:53] <zenith0111> LUL
[0:45:54] <Persona_EX> the good part about this, is that they can start every episode with a stinger from this bullshit that's happening LOOK AT THE POSITIVE SIDE
[0:45:54] <$cureneckbeard> brain gobolins
[0:45:55] <DonatelloJose> and that's why Pat doesn't poop in public places.
[0:45:57] <+SkaNinja> sometimes the mess is SOOO big, you gotta shower after
[0:45:59] <Ranryu692> Pat's water bill must be something to see
[0:45:59] <MasterDecoder> That is not the reason
[0:45:59] <ShreddingPixels> ...
[0:45:59] <Forgottenheck> PunOko PunOko PunOko KonCha
[0:46:01] <+rdark_ksu> if ya poo ya might as well just go back to bed and start over
[0:46:01] <%gigacanuck> but Pat, why not just run around naked all day then?
[0:46:02] <+axebird> What????
[0:46:03] <prince_ire> There are in truck stops
[0:46:03] <+NWR_James> Pat what
[0:46:03] <$Louie_Salmon> Unless you get creative
[0:46:03] <rytisone> but what if you gotta?
[0:46:04] <vingadivo> pat is goddamn right
[0:46:04] <Tha_Mik> I mean...
[0:46:04] <+vicious_rage> you can improvise with a sink
[0:46:07] <sonofthedeepsouth> NAH JUST SHIT
[0:46:08] <alcors_wisdom> a sink is a shower if you arent a coward
[0:46:09] <PlainSimpleTailor> DAMMIT PAT, Every time I think you have some shred of sanity you have to do this to me WHYYY
[0:46:09] <+cvp5127> no its the splashback
[0:46:10] <marvel877> You got to take your pants off but keep your shirt on because the shirt acts as a buffer to protect you from any sort of germs on the underside of the toilet lid that you may or may not lean back against.
[0:46:10] <Gerik1233> NO!
[0:46:10] <zenith0111> HUH
[0:46:10] <vingadivo> TRUR
[0:46:10] <worldbrand> it would be WAY WORSE if there WERE showers
[0:46:10] <LeiaSkynoober> Pat wtf. I thought you were OCD
[0:46:11] <alrobot2014> i can agree with that
[0:46:12] <Junkfist> When are public toilets going to have changing rooms?
[0:46:13] <GarbageQueenEllie> Look at the most recent trophy guys
[0:46:13] <vingadivo> true
[0:46:14] <+kstick07> NotLikeThis
[0:46:15] <AfroKing24> do you take your clothes off to take the trash out?
[0:46:15] <+supergreenmario> pat why are u like that
[0:46:16] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Whenever you flush your toilet it creates a mist that wafts through your whole bathroom and coats every surface with toilet residue. Which includes your toothbrush
[0:46:17] <happyface699> Damn right
[0:46:18] <%SirGO0SE> the number 1 reason you SHOULD use public bathrooms is what if you might shit your pants
[0:46:19] <@Menitta> is it OBS?
[0:46:20] <AlexStAdams> Just dunk a wad of toilet paper in the toilet water and use the moist wad to do the final wipe
[0:46:20] <+Antoids> what about at the gym
[0:46:20] <KLouDraws> so is that what happens whenever your run off stream to use the bathroom, Pat? lol
[0:46:22] <+VariousOminousDrones> Japanese squat toilets are the worst.
[0:46:24] <The_Swedish_X> Pat is either really good at making up bullshit on the spot, or is actually this crazy.
[0:46:24] <+CJett92> unmute it
