[0:04:13] <%dds333a> @reesemonster23 yes. it handles reliably well, but it's slow and stiff
[0:04:28] <turboyabo> digital devil sage is where they 1000 percent dump all there effort out

[0:07:28] <%kullumanati> Woolievs main chick is fighting games of course crumbs don‚Äôt matter. Too bad
[0:07:49] <+JupiterDjin> I used to be with it, now what I'm with isn't it and what's it is new and scary to me.

[0:08:10] <%dds333a> @jupiterdjin IT'LL HAPPEN TO YOU
[0:08:16] <andre11dr> Woolie i hate this
[0:08:20] <%CaptainPileDriver> yo we getting part 9 this year
[0:08:24] <Reesemonster23> all bioshock games are really good I hope the new one that is planned is good.
[0:08:24] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:08:35] <%Seancicle> moi aussi woolieFUN
[0:08:38] <+zanz_san> I have 1500 hours in mhw but I rarely used the event armor.  I killed extreme behemoth 50+ times
[0:08:56] <%holydeviant1> Two drills!
[0:09:01] <Belakitu> BIGGER Drill
[0:09:03] <andre11dr> Like why not just play a caracter action game at that point
[0:09:25] <%Prevot> both
[0:09:27] <JetpackMcQuack> The bioshock name
[0:09:27] <%CaptainPileDriver> oh yeah the story and gameplay are annoying
[0:09:28] <%holydeviant1> Woolie would play Prey and just go unga wrench build and that's okay
[0:09:29] <Reesemonster23> mitten squad actually beat bioshock 2 with just the drill
[0:09:54] <Afrosamasenpai> someone didnt play the dlc
[0:10:08] <%Seancicle> üà∑Ô∏èüàÅÔ∏è
[0:10:09] <Belakitu> But how play Thief tho?
[0:10:10] <+BananaSlammuh> Bioshock 2 had the best gameplay. Infinite was pretty neat tho.
[0:10:38] <andre11dr> That's like playing Bloodborne and being like 'No i like shooters so i refuse to use melee weapons"
[0:10:46] <@Menitta> Bioshock 2 is cool.  playing as a big daddy
[0:11:00] <%CaptainPileDriver> big daddy with big drill
[0:11:05] <%dds333a> that shit is on Amazon, which threw me
[0:11:13] <%CaptainPileDriver> they were bad
[0:11:15] <%holydeviant1> Rebuilds were good
[0:11:27] <%dds333a> they are, but if you want 3 0 you should do 1 0 and 2 0
[0:11:36] <@Menitta> I dont like the first rebuild since it's not paced for a movie
[0:11:46] <%CaptainPileDriver> the rebuilds are varying in quality
[0:11:52] <+zanz_san> It's Anno's Turn A Gundam
[0:11:53] <+BananaSlammuh> Rebuilds we‚Äôre rough but now they are great. The final movie is aces
[0:12:20] <leith_aziz> Hello
[0:12:23] <@Menitta> you can skip the first rebuild tbh
[0:12:27] <%Seancicle> ÁßÅ‰∫Ä„ÅÆÂ≠¶Áîü
[0:12:27] <+zanz_san> Anno's wife really helped him out
[0:12:27] <andre11dr> I saw them, didn't care much about them but i don't care about Eva that hard anyway
[0:12:29] <%dds333a> it has some things, yeah
[0:12:31] <%CaptainPileDriver> SKIP THE FIRST one please
[0:12:35] <leith_aziz> Any topics I missed?
[0:12:38] <%CaptainPileDriver> that one is legit bad
[0:12:54] <%CaptainPileDriver> not really
[0:12:56] <%dds333a> however, if one has seen Death and rebirth, then maybe some stuff already rehashed
[0:12:59] <+Hollow_Mirage> Best Shinji is the SRW one where he gets Bright Slapped and becomes a chad
[0:13:20] <dds333a> has reg read the manga? Kappa
[0:13:25] <%CaptainPileDriver> i don't remember anything of value you NEED to see in the first one
[0:13:25] <%RyTYoung> Wait are we talking about Eva as a whole or just the rebuilds?
[0:13:27] <@Menitta> I dont think so? I just remember rebuild 1 being a recap of the first few episodes
[0:13:34] <@Menitta> I saw it recently too
[0:13:40] <sendart> the first one is more remake but the rest go crazy
[0:13:41] <%holydeviant1> Rebuild is Anno coming back to the series without horrible depression
[0:13:41] <%dds333a> @rytyoung just Rebuild
[0:13:42] <+zanz_san> It's basically the manga ending
[0:13:44] <andre11dr> Just keep in mind that the guy making ir hates the series and you
[0:13:46] <%CaptainPileDriver> the first rebuild wasn't anything new that mattered
[0:14:05] <+BananaSlammuh> I think the first one had a couple teases (think the moon scenes) but nothing too different and it‚Äôs covered in the second one
[0:14:07] <%dds333a> I'd say Remake is MORE distinct than 1.0
[0:14:09] <JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[0:14:19] <%CaptainPileDriver> the second one is where you can start and miss nothing
[0:14:21] <@Menitta> lol
[0:14:27] <%RyTYoung> @dds333a ahh tyty
[0:14:45] <%dds333a> np
[0:15:00] <%asakura_ayase> Eva is a series I don‚Äôt really like, but I appreciate its existence
[0:15:15] <%dds333a> huh
[0:15:20] <andre11dr> That's me ,i didn't care
[0:15:20] <mrblitzstream> time for a Eva Movie Binge
[0:15:35] <%RyTYoung> I've been trying to get my best friend to either watch JoJo's or Eva, and he hasn't started either NotLikeThis
[0:15:35] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:15:36] <@Menitta> Idk how I feel about Eva. I watched all of it a year ago
[0:15:43] <@Menitta> its neat
[0:15:45] <%RyTYoung> I watched Jujitsu Kaisen for them NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[0:15:46] <%CaptainPileDriver> i prefer the manga
[0:16:04] <%dds333a> @rytyoung fuck LUL
[0:16:05] <@Menitta> not mind blowing or best anime of all time like its built up to be
[0:16:10] <andre11dr> I don't think Eva is tash but so many people have been overeating it so hard that i kinda find it disappointing
[0:16:15] <leith_aziz> @RyTYoung JoJo fan here. Getting into JoJO takes time, but I'm glad I got into it
[0:16:21] <leith_aziz> *JoJo
[0:16:31] <%RyTYoung> @dds333a he's an ass LUL
[0:16:44] <%dds333a> based
[0:16:50] <+zanz_san> I'm glad that Anno finished Eva to finally make Shin Ultraman.  Tsubaraiya Pro have been on ball lately
[0:17:05] <%RyTYoung> @leith_aziz ngl it did take me some time to get through the first part, but after that I was sold
[0:17:18] <%CaptainPileDriver> yes
[0:17:22] <%CaptainPileDriver> those days are rough
[0:17:25] <andre11dr> That was today
[0:17:31] <Pookiedaexzile> Dat be Sleep yo
[0:17:31] <%dds333a> thankfully, I always know why. the issue is fixing it TearGlove
[0:17:35] <@Menitta> that was yesterday for me
[0:17:35] <andre11dr> Butci knew why tho
[0:17:36] <leith_aziz> Here's the thing, I know almost nothing of Evangelion. If some people really like it and like to share to others they're thought on it, that seems fine
[0:17:44] <%RyTYoung> omg I'm sorry to hear BibleThump
[0:17:49] <Balcazaurus> "Obsess over the problem until it doesn't exist anymore." That's real, Woolie.
[0:18:01] <Pookiedaexzile> Sorry for your loss
[0:18:01] <leith_aziz> huh? I didnt hear the comment. But im sorry for whatever happened
[0:18:07] <%dds333a> ouch
[0:18:13] <%CaptainPileDriver> why would you only demon flip at me
[0:18:16] <mrblitzstream> ooofff

[0:18:18] <Reesemonster23> that sounds like sf5 to me lmao LUL
[0:18:19] <+zanz_san> horrible
[0:18:23] <@Menitta> Akuma keeps you humble
[0:18:30] <leith_aziz> Is Akuma like the Chipp of SF?
[0:18:38] <andre11dr> That's all games tho
[0:18:40] <%dds333a> what ELSE did he do tho, seriously cmonBruh
[0:18:47] <%CaptainPileDriver> I PLAY ABIGIAL, WHY YOU FLIPPING AT ME
[0:18:48] <Pookiedaexzile> The Hardcorest
[0:18:50] <%dds333a> @leith_aziz depending on the game. worse
[0:18:53] <JetpackMcQuack> the angry
[0:18:53] <%asakura_ayase> The grime
[0:19:00] <%holydeviant1> It's like making Scumble, from discworld, though no one will get that one
[0:19:01] <Pookiedaexzile> The Streets
[0:19:01] <hologram_sam> Cream of the Crop & the Sour Milk
[0:19:02] <leith_aziz> @dds333a I played Tekken 7.
[0:19:08] <%dds333a> akuma is well documented as the shoto that has everything
[0:19:11] <mrblitzstream> The Purest Toxic CORE
[0:19:13] <andre11dr> @captainpiledriver See now you deserve the toxicity
[0:19:14] <Pookiedaexzile> Da Streets
[0:19:18] <%CaptainPileDriver> i didn't lose any games, it's just like, really, you only gonna flip at me
[0:19:41] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's dickheads
[0:19:43] <leith_aziz> I think the most toxic in Guilty Gear I've found was a Slayer spamming teleport and 6P in Rev 2, and a really good Nago taunting once
[0:19:43] <andre11dr> Abigail players deserve no better
[0:19:54] <leith_aziz> Other than that, the community is usually pretty nice
[0:19:54] <%CaptainPileDriver> abigail players deserve love
[0:20:01] <kungfu_kaio> Hey Woolie, love your youtube channel. What are your top 5 favorite shonen?
[0:20:12] <+wumpy3d> woiah an ad

[0:22:20] <andre11dr> LOOKING YOU guy that tried to run away with my PC
[0:22:28] <@Menitta> What is nice is that, at least in the states, the FedEx shipment requires signature
[0:22:39] <%TubeMan642> you can buy a doorbell cam for like $40
[0:22:39] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:22:41] <%dds333a> RINGU will take care of it
[0:22:41] <andre11dr> Literally chased him down the street
[0:22:41] <%CaptainPileDriver> who was the delivery company, cause i've had my local USPS sign for packages for me and just not attempt to deliver
[0:22:58] <%CaptainPileDriver> and i was pissed they signed my name so they didn't have to walk to the door
[0:23:07] <kungfu_kaio> Woolie, do you like Dragon Ball? What is your favorite saga?
[0:23:12] <@Menitta> god now I'm scared lmao. that problem never occurred to me
[0:23:13] <+zanz_san> My dad was doing yard work and he caught a porch pirate trying to steal our neighbors package and he shamed him to put it back.
[0:23:25] <Balcazaurus> Oh my
[0:23:36] <Balcazaurus> This apartment

[1:29:59] <%dds333a> yes, just recently
[1:30:00] <TheHeroAppears> 1st episode is up
[1:30:08] <+FataltheBaptist> thank you @dds333a
[1:30:18] <+FataltheBaptist> cant wait to deep dive
[1:30:51] <%pupil31> Is Woolie planning to play the second game also?
[1:31:04] <+FataltheBaptist> does woolie look at the stats, aesthetics or other factors when choosing his demons
[1:31:22] <%dds333a> @pupil31 he's never mentioned it thus far, it's up to him, I guess
[1:31:29] <+FataltheBaptist> there is a 2nd raidou game?
[1:31:55] <%dds333a> @fatalthebaptist by what he's said previously, aesthetics do play a factor
[1:32:16] <%dds333a> LUL
[1:32:21] <Reesemonster23> empty them pockets reminds me of my favorite moment from dmc5

[1:34:00] <+FataltheBaptist> for whatever reason i never applied the grinding concept i learned in pokemon to other games and hamstrung myself in this game and monsterseed

[1:35:10] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:35:22] <+zanz_san> smoke em if you got em
[1:35:36] <+FataltheBaptist> rick moranis quote
[1:35:43] <%dds333a> @fatalthebaptist makes sense, although grinding isn't exactly required in this game. it's also remarkably easy to keep demons well past the point of their "usefulness" in this game than in other smt games
[1:36:19] <+zanz_san> it's so fucked down here in Tampa/St. Pete
[1:36:30] <+FataltheBaptist> oooh snake lady from Hercules the legendary journeys

[1:39:50] <+zanz_san> nice
[1:40:01] <+FataltheBaptist> sorry to hear that, yeah i'm on the east coast too. I knew a year was way too optimistic

[1:44:34] <%meniscate> I wonder what's Dark Montreal like?
[1:45:02] <TheHeroAppears> he seems useless against them
[1:45:56] <andre11dr> Yeah Woolie use the demon weak again wind against the birds
[1:46:15] <+FataltheBaptist> arent the birds weak to lightning though
[1:46:15] <%meniscate> Most of the elemental weaknesses carry over from game to game. You can also usually just look at a demon and tell what they're weak to. it's on fire? Then it must be weak to ice. It can fly? Then Zio.
[1:46:36] <%dds333a> @andre11dr the classic, this demons has the skill I need, but he's also weak to what I want to avoid LUL
[1:47:05] <%dds333a> @meniscate also, birds often and up being weak to gun in the games that have them
[1:47:05] <+FataltheBaptist> what is that weird Tulpa doll running behind raidou

[1:55:04] <%dds333a> @fatalthebaptist Jubokko is a Debisama design, that has appeared a few times here and there. Oboroguruma is a classic demon designed after SMT 1's Chris the Car (which itself is a reference to Christine), but this devising is made for this game

[1:57:45] <+Hollow_Mirage> You can now Punch Buggy
[1:57:47] <%dds333a> it's similar to the Wanyudo, which is a living wagon wheel
[1:57:57] <OblivionSword1> probably because the japanese word for car is similar sounding to guruma
[1:58:32] <+chief_chongo> those old illustrations of oboruguma are kinda terrifying

[2:07:15] <mrblitzstream> constipated demon LUL
[2:07:16] <%dds333a> @chief_chongo laziness, even at the cost of self-interest

[2:07:31] <dinnydanny777> Shape of waters limesO
[2:07:31] <+chief_chongo> so hes too lazy to wipe and get up
[2:07:47] <+chief_chongo> I'm pretty sure medieval depictions of belphegor dont have the toilet lol
[2:07:47] <%dds333a> @chief_chongo exactly LUL
[2:08:02] <andre11dr> @chief_chongo Yeah it's supposed to represent laziness

[2:08:53] <andre11dr> Close enough
[2:09:02] <+chief_chongo> you wacky belphegor
[2:09:39] <andre11dr> Bephegor at least makes sense when you look at him

[2:11:17] <+chief_chongo> yeah says belphegor is the chief demon in the domain of sloth. feels kinda underused as a tutorial miniboss in p5
[2:11:51] <andre11dr> He's a sidequest in Radiou 2
[2:11:53] <civilized_worm12> going deep Kreygasm
[2:12:05] <+vaderxyz1970> This feels like woolie and reggie going to the grocery store
[2:12:18] <%dds333a> @chief_chongo I agree, but all the games in this franchise indeed change the importance. tiers, and somewhat abilities within each game
[2:12:51] <+chief_chongo> yeah true
[2:13:11] <%dds333a> certain demons are always important and momentous, such as Metatron, Astaroth, and Melchizedek, and some are always weak, such as pixies, knockers, and slimes, but the spectrum is always variable
[2:13:26] <%Lion_kun> How does a car get poisoned?
[2:13:39] <+vaderxyz1970> Wrong type of fuel

[3:17:03] <alphalejandro> I like how Raidou's overworld map icon has a little cap
[3:17:20] <Phob05> It's very SMT 1
[3:17:22] <%meniscate> "You can go anywhere with a Large Tarasque"
[3:17:30] <XeroRaizer> free travel until someone fucks up turning around a boat
[3:17:47] <Qu1ckyyy> How do regular people see this?
[3:18:00] <Phob05> With thier eyes
[3:18:04] <%dds333a> yup, classic SMT overworld
[3:18:08] <andre11dr> They probably just see him floating
[3:18:10] <sirrice77> So is Raidou openly riding on a giant demon though the river and no one has a problem with that?
[3:18:27] <%elderpunch> dr who??
[3:18:33] <%dds333a> @qu1ckyyy just you wait Kappa
[3:18:41] <XeroRaizer> people get attacked by zombies daily and you think a giant demonic turtle will turn heads
[3:19:16] <+fetrigon> sus...
[3:19:29] <kkall49> RE Puzzle if ive ever seen one
[3:19:34] <%dds333a> @xeroraizer to be fair. all the random battles take place with Raidou getting dragged in to the Dark Realm LUL

[3:19:58] <XeroRaizer> psaLiz
[3:20:19] <andre11dr> @dds333a Random people get grabbed into the dark realm too tho
[3:20:44] <Phob05> It's special
[3:20:47] <%dds333a> @andre11dr right, but not only do they not make it, most ordinary people think it's just urban legend LUL
[3:21:31] <andre11dr> You'd think someone would look for them but nope

[3:23:49] <%meniscate> @pupil31 Edo Glide
[3:24:00] <Phob05> In SMT 2 there was a reference to the Steven King novel Cristine as an enemy called Chris the Car so I see this as a royalty free replacement

[4:14:31] <%dds333a> yeah, don't like chocolate. have to drink water immediately after
[4:14:32] <andre11dr> My second choice would be raspberry
[4:14:35] <@Solidus_113> mint choco
[4:14:35] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:14:40] <%dds333a> to get the taste out. too much sugar
[4:14:41] <%GHouseduivel> Damn son.
[4:14:47] <%jonblnt> no such thing as too much chocolate
