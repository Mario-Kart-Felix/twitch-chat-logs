[0:02:21] <%EdenOfSecondAccount> Your noise canceling shit is on point I cant hear shit in the background
[0:02:23] <servicesuspension> Harman, the cock carousel won't change. All it does is turn. Now, let's dance.
[0:02:25] <Dogking16> Damn , we get paid by the hour. fucking chill.
[0:02:27] <SomeAsianDood> so where is woolie in DE?
[0:02:29] <+Hollow_Mirage> There is this Single Room building in my home town that IS STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION! IT STARTED IN 2011
[0:02:30] <Solidnick18> ah yes
[0:02:32] <absolute_cagemony> Bees?
[0:02:33] <smamgotdam> aw fuck
[0:02:37] <smamgotdam> god I've been there
[0:02:37] <+BedHome> damn construction wasps
[0:02:40] <ajvstheworld> THE BEES!!!!
[0:02:41] <+OblivionSword1> 50% shiver check for construction
[0:02:41] <+b_aleph> BEADS???
[0:02:43] <+Undenizen> @SomeAsianDood we have YET to find the corpse
[0:02:47] <%Juriasu> I will never understand why construction happens at exactly 7 am for one hour and then no more for that entire day
[0:02:49] <dukenux> Woke up this morning, got myself the BZZZRRRRTTT
[0:02:49] <ajvstheworld> Aaaaah!
[0:02:53] <+kullumanati> Wools need to get the union boss on them
[0:03:05] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> BUT the servers have to be up
[0:03:06] <%saladin1911> Same tbh. People were cutting down trees behind my place so that was cool
[0:03:09] <exnuart> problem is you void your warrenty opening your console
[0:03:11] <EternalJedi> oh so same fix as GBC pokemon
[0:03:13] <@Menitta> oh yeah
[0:03:14] <SomeAsianDood> @undenizen so yet to internalize advanced race theory. nice I wanna be here for that
[0:03:14] <skyentombment> Woolie awakens to the sound of DOKKADOKKADOKKADOKKA
[0:03:16] <+SuperKirby24> time to learn to solder Kappa
[0:03:19] <absolute_cagemony> MercyWing1 PinkMercy MercyWing2
[0:03:22] <exnuart> that battery is in your PC too woolz
[0:03:24] <Solidnick18> whatever the delay of death is over
[0:03:26] <+drakthebest> tbf if you're still using your console that far in the future you're probably the type of person savvy enough to do that. More casual users don't use consoles that long
[0:03:26] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @servicesuspension
[0:03:34] <+robo_trunk> If the servers shut down before the battery dies, once it dies it's game over
[0:03:34] <ajvstheworld> Awesome.
[0:03:38] <$dudedude55555> those batteries are everywhere, internal clocks
[0:03:38] <derap41> Planned Obsolesces
[0:03:46] <+Jiggisnipe> sounds like the limits of battery tech tbh
[0:03:49] <ajvstheworld> Apple does the same shit.
[0:03:55] <@Menitta> its fucked
[0:03:56] <GothicCrusader> @WoolieVersus The issue is if the battery dies and the servers too
[0:03:59] <$dudedude55555> as long as you can replace them it's fine
[0:04:03] <TheRealGreaterGamer> I am limited by the technology of my time.
[0:04:15] <dds333a> Everything dies eventually, but this is different, indeed
[0:04:19] <EternalJedi> why don't they just tie the clock into the actual PSU instead of a separate battery
[0:04:20] <servicesuspension> And then there's my startropics cartridge from 1990 that works and saves perfectly
[0:04:26] <%Exiliator> I remember trying to replace my old gameboy-games battery
[0:04:26] <Karhax> cmos needs continous power, it's in every motherboard
[0:04:30] <dukenux> There are talks about Right to Repair bill being passed here.
[0:04:32] <+Jiggisnipe> I imagine there will be guys who know how to replace it
[0:04:32] <derap41> You can be the absolute worst to him
[0:04:36] <@Menitta> I see this news and I look at the thousands of dollars worth of games on my shelf as trash
[0:04:39] <exnuart> @EternalJedi that battery is usually in the motherboard
[0:04:56] <%livlinn> Eat ass? joofbLurk
[0:05:02] <%Seancicle> nous travaillons. Ça-va?
[0:05:02] <Karhax> @eternaljedi you need constant power, can't unplug then

[0:05:25] <%KetsuoTaberu> @exiliator you know it
[0:05:27] <+kullumanati> All done
[0:05:31] <EternalJedi> Karhax oh, power loss means it's entirely borked? not as simple as just resetting the clock when power comes back on?
[0:05:32] <dds333a> Oh, wait, here comes the surprise 3 parter
[0:05:46] <andre11dr> It can be quite long
[0:05:53] <derap41> Its as long as you make it

[0:12:13] <@Menitta> you should totally do that

[0:12:30] <nomos42> Chat buffing is fun

[0:12:32] <Iwashi94> @WoolieVersus it's only 1 point we'd get to move
[0:12:34] <%d1stantutopia> @zanzibarian_hamster SSSick, thanks

[0:12:40] <$dudedude55555> 2nd playthrough with twitch
[0:12:41] <%SainEdge> i think you still have to allow the stat change everytime
[0:12:43] <%Noonoox12> woolieGLORY woolieGLORY
[0:12:43] <+mechslayer71> Not like chat spammed the fuck out of that information during the last stream or anything
[0:12:44] <Solidnick18> maybe late game
[0:12:50] <+OblivionSword1> that means no twitch integration for now
[0:12:51] <SomeAsianDood> It's important to know that we literally can't fuck u over with twitch integration
[0:12:53] <derap41> Pat scummed like a fucker with that
[0:12:54] <%Exiliator> worst case just reload maybe?

[0:13:12] <derap41> Just play the game
[0:13:12] <zanzibarian_hamster> I like chat being "the call of the void", because it's always going to pick the really dumb choice
[0:13:16] <+projectmanatees> we can also see your currant quests and items so will help in knowing where you are
[0:13:18] <servicesuspension> fail forward forever
[0:13:21] <FassieFons> scum scum scum!
[0:13:21] <primaryfire> remember that lines starting with "wait" or "hold on" will not advance the conversation!
[0:13:22] <%JustToWatch> you can only see chat's option and get the stat change if you activate it. the neutral state is off
[0:13:22] <Lewisisphat> don't let twitch chat get involved
[0:13:23] <aiutare47> It also allows chat to read your task log and get a glossary of every stat and what they do
[0:13:25] <+kullumanati> Just for assistance in passing white checks

[0:41:17] <leith_aziz> What happened last hour? Can someone fill me in?
[0:41:18] <%doomerskeletor13> I would say to always try the dialogue options before the check, sometimes they add modifiers
[0:41:21] <%andrewofbob> @WoolieVersus You've got physical damage and your effective endurance is 1, so remember to heal up before retrying
[0:41:24] <bevyrage> time to explore the area and look for some clues elsewhere
[0:41:25] <servicesuspension> the famous Revachol Baconator
[0:41:26] <+MrAtheGreat> @linSP RIP that bad luck
[0:41:32] <+Jiggisnipe> Pat passed an 8% and failed a 97% in the same stream
[0:41:34] <nakunattakage> The game gives you time to heal if you take damage on 1 hp btw
[0:41:40] <%JustToWatch> you can get bonuses to roles from doing the other dialogue options first
[0:41:41] <wearty11> fuck i had to reload 7 times to pass a 42 percent check once
[0:41:49] <Klarrann3> save often
[0:41:54] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus You can usually exhaust dialogue BEFORE skill checks. Sometimes you'll be rewarded for doing so. Sometimes actually PUNISHED. But it will usually be apparent when that would be the case.
[0:42:05] <+MrAtheGreat> @wearty11 Yeah I had to do the same. The option to take down the body?

[1:22:02] <dukenux> thats generally a thing in hospital service
[1:22:03] <ulcaban> ONE CASE

[1:22:05] <DSD24> @millibekah Hey man it ain't simping when Kim is a high quality cop
[1:22:05] <yeeyeyee> There are only two defenses against secondhand trauma, humor and faith

[1:23:14] <wearty11> @millibekah hard not to when the first thing you know about him is that he'd die for you for no real reason
[1:23:18] <vadnhi> Cant argue there...
[1:23:21] <yeeyeyee> @Gomfury he can't anymore, cocked it up
[1:23:23] <+Arnoldoaad1> I HAD NO IDEA OF THIS, I found a pen on a side mission before getting the ledger, this is incredible
[1:23:33] <derap41> oh its a TODO
[1:23:37] <doodlingdisaster> To be fair you just went through garbage before this. Still wearing the same gloves too
[1:23:40] <%jonblnt> WOOLIE

[1:26:55] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus You dont need to level up right away. You can horde them to use on thoughts or to retry skill checks you fail.

[1:27:55] <Pappajimbo> bonl black on the crisylids
[1:27:55] <nakunattakage> gotta actually try the low % ones to succeed them Kappa
[1:27:57] <VJdarkworld> probability be like "BUT IT WAS 80% NotLikeThis NotLikeThis"
[1:27:58] <%CodenameChaz> Getting some x-com rolls here
[1:28:00] <Blank9> white checks refresh on ANY level up or after sleeping
[1:28:01] <iosephe> Logic says these guesses are bound to happen
[1:28:03] <pyshcocanuck> you'll get a 12 eventually
[1:28:03] <%TheA1ternative> Soon we'll be hitting failure on a 99% mark my words
[1:28:05] <servicesuspension> RNG doesn't stand for Mercy, Woolie
[1:28:08] <%hax_metatron> It's actually good, because I want him to move on to other things. The case files are good to read in a later stream LUL
[1:28:09] <Ravioli_Ronin> I failed a 97% check before
[1:28:09] <jorniev> SNke eyes
[1:28:17] <$hattrick61> Thats how it is on this bitch of a revachol
[1:28:18] <DatAsuna> Tbh the rolls aspect of this game kinda ruin the checks for me
[1:28:18] <penitentpendant> @TheA1ternative The highest in the game is 97%
[1:28:27] <laguerrilha> i missed 5x the same perception roll with 80% scucess
[1:28:30] <doodlingdisaster> @Blank9 Don't you need to level up the relevant skill/trigger a hidden trigger?
[1:28:31] <exnuart> inb4 woolie gets all his 12s on 97%s
[1:28:31] <+gnosislord> Oh, this is actual actual random numbers, not like Fire Emblem or something
[1:28:32] <$dudedude55555> save the files for later

[1:29:16] <+walternatorz> high iq are more likely to leave the force
[1:29:16] <DSD24> Yeah you did too good on the IQ test you can't be a cop
[1:29:17] <doodlingdisaster> WTF????
[1:29:18] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @Chatterbox1991
[1:29:18] <%BallerSwagBro9k> WHAT
[1:29:18] <$JobbedBone> its a cost saving things BECAUSE THEY'LL LEAVE AFTER TRAINING
[1:29:19] <Queqs_> Fake news. I've read the article
[1:29:19] <%hax_metatron> You basically can't show emotional intelligence
[1:29:20] <Ravioli_Ronin> Fr, failing at 97%, on a hard-progress roll? I’m gonna fucking reload
[1:29:22] <SolSwagGuy56> 2 SMART

[1:29:30] <penitentpendant> "You're too smart. We think you're gonna murder people and try and cover it up on the job."
[1:29:31] <derap41> They Won't "Tow the line"
[1:29:31] <TheToanon> ACAB
[1:29:32] <brachydios777> Fucked
[1:29:32] <+yukichocomilk> they need the idiots LUL
[1:29:32] <PoopyDickens> Woolie is too smart to be a cop
[1:29:33] <+Jiggisnipe> yea it's called being overqualified
[1:29:34] <Louie_Salmon> They would snitch, that's why
[1:29:38] <+eanscrale> that explains a lot
[1:29:38] <DonatelloJose> That sounds like some fake news.
[1:29:39] <derap41> bitch its 4 weeks
[1:29:39] <$dudedude55555> thanks murrice
[1:29:39] <pyshcocanuck> They'll see how fucked it is and leave
[1:29:39] <DatAsuna> ACAB
[1:29:39] <Space_Pagan> wow
[1:29:41] <Pookiedaexzile> Well that's Your problem
[1:29:42] <Queqs_> Its one precinct doing this in one place
[1:29:43] <Space_Pagan> ACAB
[1:29:47] <A0N33> LUL Cops get like a month of training
[1:29:47] <dukenux> Why even factor it? IQ is a bs measurement
[1:29:48] <AngryAsian5> Overqualified LUL
[1:29:49] <%kewlmyc> Sounds fake as fuck
[1:29:49] <derap41> 4-6 weeks of training
[1:29:50] <+Jiggisnipe> lot of jobs do that
[1:29:50] <%jonblnt> IQ is kinda bullshit
[1:29:53] <+ReallyBigRocks> It's not actually that long
[1:30:01] <PoopyDickens> If you ask an undercover cop cop hat their IQ is they have to tell you
[1:30:02] <neroforte177> sick
[1:30:02] <servicesuspension> You can't have Sherlock writing parking tickets
[1:30:02] <%doomerskeletor13> IQ is bullshit anyways but yeah
[1:30:02] <nakunattakage> Yeah I've heard that too
[1:30:03] <Blank9> cops hate rick and morty
[1:30:04] <+AugiJr> Thats BS
[1:30:04] <$dudedude55555> what's the cut off? 80?
[1:30:10] <andre11dr> Well, unless you're super dedicated to police work
[1:30:12] <vadnhi> "Become a Private Detectice, or something...
[1:30:13] <DatAsuna> IQ is indeed actually BS yes
[1:30:13] <aiutare47> yeah it is good to keep in mind its one organization I believe
[1:30:14] <+Arnoldoaad1> this on the US only?
[1:30:16] <%kewlmyc> That shits all over detectives though
[1:30:16] <%TheA1ternative> as woolie said, its expensive
[1:30:17] <+SammyOVision> Can't have people questioning the police state
[1:30:18] <%andrewofbob> The training is dead short, hence why they botch it so much
[1:30:18] <%emperordread> IQs are kinda BS, but this is still no surprise to hear that cops are even worse than we already thought
[1:30:19] <derap41> They want Bruisers not law uppholders
[1:30:19] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> its from 2000
[1:30:23] <putnampuppeteer> all cops are midwits
[1:30:24] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> IMPLICATIONS YOU SAY HMMM
[1:30:24] <PoopyDickens> @dudedude55555 like 90 probably LUL
[1:30:25] <roarofdamnation> That's fuck up
[1:30:26] <Queqs_> ITS FROM 2000
[1:30:27] <iacus_> we need Patreon cops
[1:30:28] <%doomerskeletor13> BIG implications
[1:30:29] <Estwilde> This is basically the George Carlin bit on smart workers
[1:30:29] <nakunattakage> It's not about IQ it's about job retention
[1:30:33] <%CodenameChaz> "If you're too smart, you might get wise to the grift"
[1:30:35] <nakunattakage> but the sentiment is the same
[1:30:37] <derap41> They want enforcers
[1:30:38] <Solidnick18> messed up man
[1:30:42] <+caramelatte1> Services is funded by taxes so makes sense
[1:30:44] <+eanscrale> It is a grift
[1:30:48] <VJdarkworld> so you can reach the cases still cus its meant for low IQ
[1:30:53] <PoopyDickens> High IQ cop is an oxymoron lmao
[1:30:55] <andre11dr> I'll point out that Woolie has been wrong about this specific stuff before
[1:31:04] <roarofdamnation> Seems like an excuse to just hire people that will be easy to use in a corrupt system
[1:31:04] <Darren716> Wait this was one department, in 2000
[1:31:08] <+caramelatte1> They dont have the funding to train people using it as a stepping stone
[1:31:16] <iacus_> I think I didn't see this
[1:31:18] <DatAsuna> IQ basically measures a narrow aspect of intelligence but it goes hand in hand with the failures of modern school testing focus anyway
[1:31:20] <derap41> So ABC is full of shit in that case
[1:31:23] <die_hardman> The good faith gist of it is that high IQ individuals might be better suited for other positions. Could also be for stability in the “work force”
[1:31:29] <jorniev> high functioning cop sounds more like a detective
[1:31:31] <chippybippers> chat what're we talking about my internet dropped

[1:31:44] <PoopyDickens> To be fair uh this is a fictional universe so high IQ cops are more believable ☝️🤓
[1:31:45] <exnuart> @derap41 most news is full of shit
[1:31:46] <andre11dr> I was just saying, I'm pretty skeptical usually
[1:31:49] <Robot_Nixon_> found the cop in chat
[1:31:52] <linSP> thanks for the link
[1:31:54] <+ReallyBigRocks> The only thing I think he's wrong about is that cops don't get trained for very long at all
[1:31:55] <oda_flobunaga> Mongo the detective, such a good idea
[1:31:56] <Kofvscapcom> lol arguing that the cops in the US don't have enough funding to do anything is hilarious

[1:33:26] <Blank9> benefits means more passives trigger
[1:33:28] <%BlueJoneleth> visual calculus
[1:33:28] <Kataiser> You can level up during a conversation.
[1:33:30] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus It's actually better to horde!
[1:33:31] <yeeyeyee> @WoolieVersus you can level up inside a conversation
[1:33:34] <penitentpendant> A fair choice, at least
[1:33:34] <nakunattakage> you could keep a pocket skill point to retry a white check for momentum's sake
[1:33:35] <+Arnoldoaad1> visual calculus to retry that trigger
[1:33:39] <DonatelloJose> More health would be good.
[1:33:40] <+OblivionSword1> that's why you save those points
[1:33:42] <derap41> Thought Cabinet does more for stats and is more intresting
[1:33:43] <Blank9> you can get a ton of thought slots with levels too
[1:33:46] <%andrewofbob> Level a skill for a failed white check to reopen the check
[1:33:47] <nelsonsaysbooya> White checks are redoable. Might as well fail, then pump points

[1:34:12] <ingman112> A good balance is to hoard one level up point once you get multiple, and use the rest (to avoid missing useful passive checks in the meantime)

[1:39:42] <pyshcocanuck> Is Estonia part of scandanavia?

[1:39:45] <%jonblnt> is Reggie wearing a blazer?

[1:39:52] <putnampuppeteer> No, it's a baltic state
[1:39:53] <%bread_assassin> IF Pat's doing communism, I guess Woolie's gotta do the COMPLETE OPPOSITE.
[1:39:54] <%hax_metatron> You are witnessing a classic playthrough

[1:40:31] <+MassConnect> fun fact: the headquarters in Estonia hired a lot of international people to work remotely
[1:40:32] <+Reverend_Roscoe> hard enough to beat someone into submission
[1:40:38] <andre11dr> So ,i did predict that Woolie would unlock the racism, we are getting closer

[1:42:25] <Blank9> rolls refresh each day, there's more than enough to do each day
[1:42:26] <choopercabra> You can come back to it any time
[1:42:26] <derap41> You can fail everything in the game and still "win"
[1:42:27] <servicesuspension> you can only fail forward
[1:42:28] <nakunattakage> you'll be able to retry most of these before you know it tbh
[1:42:29] <yeeyeyee> @Dogking16 it's fair as fair, probability isn't your friend
[1:42:31] <vadnhi> You *will* be able to retry the roll, later.

[2:11:14] <doodlingdisaster> ART COP
[2:11:14] <triangularblasphemy> Woolie hates ART
[2:11:17] <ingman112> Lol Woolie's personality already revealing itself
[2:11:19] <+allups> this shit killed me
[2:11:20] <$dudedude55555> stereo carousel
[2:11:20] <%doomerskeletor13> “Jesse what the fuck are you talking about”
[2:11:21] <leith_aziz> Speak for yourself I guess

[2:11:23] <servicesuspension> PHILISTINE
[2:11:23] <+Mendin> Sounds like Woolie's Conceptualization is RUDIMENTARY
[2:11:25] <Blank9> "I see myself in this picture and I don't like it"
[2:11:29] <derap41> This game is the best personality tester
[2:11:30] <ingman112> Gotta exit the convo first
[2:11:33] <+OblivionSword1> Ironic that Woolie hates art
[2:11:34] <+projectmanatees> thats whatt you get for tying to be 5Head cop Kappa some drugs will kill thatt
[2:11:34] <enZymeth> Woolie vs creativity
[2:11:35] <dukenux> "Jesse, what the fuck are you talking about"
[2:11:36] <%andrewofbob> SHIT COMPRESSED
[2:11:44] <%CodenameChaz> Conceptualization makes me think of those guys who put a dirty toilet in an art gallery and go "It means something"
[2:11:45] <linSP> CHEEKS CLENCHED
[2:11:48] <penitentpendant> Good ole Visual Calculus
[2:11:52] <triangularblasphemy> Woolie wants facts, forward motion, and people to just talk. I really understand where he is coming from
[2:11:56] <dukenux> uh?
[2:11:57] <MemMoor> and I thought pat was the one who hates creativity

[2:18:25] <penitentpendant> A whole new world! A whole fantastic point of view!
[2:18:31] <triangularblasphemy> Oh yeah this is why conceptualization doesn't do it for him
[2:18:33] <leith_aziz> You love seeing people getting exposed, right?

[2:18:36] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Perfect information
[2:18:40] <brachydios777> I see
[2:18:41] <andre11dr> So that's why Woolie loves racism
[2:18:42] <mr_sups> It's like overturning a log and seeing all the bugs
[2:18:43] <%ChoculaUltra> "Was that racist?" - Woolie, after trying a new sandwich at the new sandwich spot
[2:18:44] <Queqs_> G___ will be fun
[2:18:45] <triangularblasphemy> Conceptualization is all "maybe" and "masks" and "alternatives"

[2:35:40] <aiutare47> Every place has it, just no one in NA calls it "tare"
[2:35:44] <iacus_> tare is specifically the return value of those cans, not the cans themselves
[2:35:46] <putnampuppeteer> You can find it some places in some states
[2:35:47] <servicesuspension> europe is full of sidequests, it seems

[2:56:54] <%doomerskeletor13> Does he have any level ups?
[2:57:00] <%Arancet> +3 is three +1 charges
[2:57:04] <linSP> you could level endurance for more max hp
[2:57:06] <penitentpendant> There's a health item in the cafeteria, I forget if its Morale/Health though
[2:57:06] <iacus_> buy the item but DONT use it
[2:57:08] <yficaptions> *sips coffee* i can wait
[2:57:12] <%doomerskeletor13> Alcohol also buffs your health
[2:57:12] <yeeyeyee> @WoolieVersus 3 charges is 3 charges, you can use it 3 times
[2:57:17] <iacus_> save it for later
[2:57:26] <derap41> oh yeah Check what Drinking actually does for you Woolie
[2:57:26] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1384344864171732992?s=20

[2:57:43] <Zomner> cmon chat
[2:57:51] <zanzibarian_hamster> you only save like .20 getting 3, it''s no big deal
[2:57:54] <derap41> Check what booze does
[2:57:58] <%hax_metatron> Use it now yeah
[2:58:00] <nakunattakage> you can encounter natural hp heals in dialogue
[2:58:05] <%hax_metatron> Always be topped off
[2:58:07] <aiutare47> well if theres an endurance check
[2:58:15] <Louie_Salmon> Buying in bulk saves a tiny amount, that's all. It's like Costco
[2:58:16] <therustystream> endurance checks tho
[2:58:16] <iacus_> if you are topped off the hels from dialogue are wasted
[2:58:16] <+OblivionSword1> might as well top off
[2:58:20] <doodlingdisaster> You can always use the item while you're dying
[2:58:21] <penitentpendant> Some checks heal your HP/Morale. But it's risky to fish for them with 1 hp left.
[2:58:21] <yeeyeyee> @aartbastiaan i didn't realize financial responsibility was metagaming
[2:58:31] <+OblivionSword1> in case of an endurance check
[2:58:42] <aiutare47> Temo
[2:58:43] <%commanderclaw> South of the Whirling is the pawn shop

[2:58:49] <%BlueJoneleth> NO
[2:58:50] <+aartbastiaan> @yeeyeyee I meant all the "buy it but don't use it"
[2:58:50] <ingman112> There’s also a tradeoff; lower health and morale means penalties to endurance and volition, but sometimes you’ll get random heals during game moments
[2:58:51] <therustystream> -1 morale
[2:58:51] <iacus_> +1 phy but -1 morale tho
[2:58:53] <%BlueJoneleth> MINUS MORALE
[2:59:02] <+SammyOVision> Morale Damage
[2:59:02] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Yes
[2:59:05] <derap41> Morale is health Physiqe is stats
[2:59:05] <die_hardman> -1 morale
[2:59:08] <DSD24> But don’t drink
[2:59:19] <+UnderseaMagic> level endurance :)
[2:59:21] <%andrewofbob> Woolie would have drunk himself asleep
[2:59:23] <derap41> -1 mental heal plus 1 to all psy stats

[3:35:35] <lyzejag> The cops usually do that, scums
[3:35:36] <+BigBruthaThunda> race realism is just the belief that face is real, as in not socially constructed
[3:35:39] <soflicar> money in pockets
[3:35:41] <zanzibarian_hamster> shhhhhhhhh
[3:35:42] <penitentpendant> "Hello fellow Non-Police in this peaceful protest."
[3:35:45] <brachydios777> It’s really sad
[3:35:50] <Solidnick18> what you mean hmmmm

[3:36:36] <+aartbastiaan> yes
[3:36:39] <The48thCrow> @brachydios777 I mean, a lot of the points that race "realists" use are old pseudo-science that just use speculation and misrepresented statistics. I'm not sure what point of view you're coming from, but race realism is just racism veiled in pseudo-scientific rhetoric
[3:36:41] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @vadnhi

[3:38:23] <triangularblasphemy> workers are humans, humans have faces, we have a lot in common, right to work
[3:38:26] <The48thCrow> @brachydios777 In my understanding, realism is acting like you know the immutable rules and facts of the universe in simple and concrete terms, when in fact you're discussing something nuanced and difficult to untie

[3:55:45] <bonebagMEL> Extended combo
[3:55:48] <linSP> it’s a feign into a counter
[3:56:07] <dds333a> Walk away
[3:56:43] <neostria> Oh read up on the disco demolition night. Its some stupid shit
[3:56:55] <+Undenizen> mailbag got cancelled some time ago
[3:57:03] <+Kataguro> Swords, swords, and swords
[3:57:03] <vadnhi> We deffo need to add the phrase "Ham Sandwich Race' to the regular Lexicon. :P
[3:57:04] <jorniev> no for now
[3:57:09] <+TheotherKristian> Too many shit bombs must have been sent
[3:57:13] <+FuqBoiSlim> just don't send em any swords Kappa
[3:57:14] <+Undenizen> Hey woolie, remember THE AXE?
[3:57:15] <%0ctaeder> i dont have a twitter account T_T
[3:57:20] <$dudedude55555> send him the BIGGEST weapon
[3:57:21] <barbatolover> what happened?
[3:57:24] <brachydios777> Like kitannas in the mail
[3:57:29] <jorniev> also... the pandemic going on
[3:57:33] <+TheotherKristian> Send him gun
[3:57:34] <dds333a> More than one katana
[3:57:48] <vadnhi> A Katamari of Katanas
[3:57:52] <barbatolover> ohh
[3:57:59] <linSP> Cold still has life
[3:58:00] <dds333a> That's happened to me, it's neat
[3:58:01] <triangularblasphemy> I think we cannot rule out any edge cases
[3:58:02] <Blank9> I'd rather touch warm and slimy because it's closer to alive, not dead and decayed
[3:58:02] <+Undenizen> warm and slimy means you're eating compost.
[3:58:10] <%jinking79> when Cold birth life
[3:58:22] <+ericaabg> hey just wanted to pop in and say i really enjoyed you guys playing demons souls and it takes two is great so far too! much love <3
[3:58:46] <+walternatorz> both
[3:58:53] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Umm he meant level up but yes both
[3:58:55] <%BlueJoneleth> BOTH
[3:58:57] <+Mr_Pylon> both
[3:58:59] <ingman112> Both
[3:59:01] <TheRealGreaterGamer> No they arent
[3:59:03] <%BlueJoneleth> NO
[3:59:09] <%BlueJoneleth> you can level without healing
[3:59:17] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Yes
[3:59:17] <ingman112> You can level and heal in convo
[3:59:22] <dds333a> CarlSmile
[3:59:25] <penitentpendant> So you always want HP above 1. So having END and VOL max at 3 gives you wiggle room to fish for a heal.
[3:59:28] <vadnhi> You have about 4 seconds to hit the medicine button.
[3:59:28] <%Juriasu> don't worry about it
[3:59:29] <+fauxmachine> is stream over?
[3:59:32] <ingman112> Leveling doesn’t heal you unless you raise volition or endurance
[3:59:34] <linSP> if you’re topped off you have better rolls, but you might get a free heals that waste your held heals
[3:59:40] <TheRealGreaterGamer> ^^^^^
[3:59:46] <TheRealGreaterGamer> What ingman said
[3:59:55] <%cobalt_phoenix_> yes
[3:59:56] <jorniev> also some stats go down with damaged health or morale
[3:59:56] <iacus_> it is true
[3:59:58] <TheRealGreaterGamer> That is true
[3:59:58] <ingman112> Yep yep
[4:00:08] <ingman112> Also true
[4:00:09] <%Juriasu> yes but the donation messages was about using levels in conversations
[4:00:15] <Daxalog> it says "Heal now"
[4:00:24] <barbatolover> Are there any horror stories with the pole sending stuff through the mail?
[4:00:42] <%cobalt_phoenix_> if you lose all hp or mp, and you have a health item, you have a few seconds to use it
[4:00:43] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:00:46] <ingman112> Yeah I’m agreeing with what you’re saying as well
[4:00:49] <%Javaa01> If you have resources to burn
[4:00:50] <derap41> Free health is possible so never fill up
[4:00:50] <TheRealGreaterGamer> There was a miscommunication with the donation message which is where the mix up happen but you have it all right
[4:00:54] <%BlueJoneleth> basically you can store a skill point to use if you get a skill check and want to raise your chance.
[4:01:03] <%BlueJoneleth> mid convo
[4:01:03] <$emptyantics> There was a streamer that got an envelope of cum in the mail
[4:01:21] <ingman112> Yep everything you’re saying is correct
[4:01:26] <VJdarkworld> you can hold until a red check and then level up so u can do the red check too
[4:01:37] <$dudedude55555> forget about all this, buy booze and cigs
[4:01:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> Each missing health pip takes a point off their stat though
[4:01:48] <+theomnisoup> Also you cannot change gear mid-convo if you want to pass hard skill checks
[4:01:59] <+Fnir> Mental yes, not sure I ever saw a Phisical heal from conversations

[4:04:29] <VJdarkworld> reggie just bodied the existence of twitch chat
[4:04:32] <dds333a> Don't even address them
[4:04:44] <penitentpendant> Ha
[4:04:45] <Tracazoid> But watching the suffering and growth of a player is part of the fun
[4:04:49] <+Jiggisnipe> HAHAHAHA
[4:04:52] <DatAsuna> Ace Combat was amusing for me
[4:04:58] <dds333a> REGGIE CarlSmile CarlSmile
[4:04:58] <+Jiggisnipe> Pure Reggie is back I guess
[4:05:01] <+monsieurfantastic> i fucking love Reggie
[4:05:02] <dds333a> Oh please
[4:05:07] <$dudedude55555> Shin Reggie
[4:05:18] <linSP> ganbare
[4:05:24] <%Juriasu> Reggie is the wisest among us
[4:05:30] <+Jiggisnipe> maybe some people are like that
[4:05:32] <dds333a> It isn't
[4:05:34] <gamewarden92> What a ray of sunshine, Reggie is.
[4:05:38] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Sometimes people are just dicks
[4:05:39] <$dudedude55555> No, I just want you to play *correct*
[4:05:46] <rcand9> positive reggie
[4:05:52] <+Tr1pkT12> Pat rubbed a bit off on Woolie huh?
[4:05:53] <masterfire23> honestly woolley m&k foibles is like when shroud tried playing with a controller...it's all good
[4:05:54] <+Jiggisnipe> you don't understand m/kb is the correct way to play Kappa
[4:05:54] <+MightyDuckShoes> that isn't it at all
[4:06:01] <%saladin1911> Eeehhhhh. I just think those people are asshole who NEED you to know their negative opinions.
[4:06:04] <DatAsuna> always some newbies
[4:06:06] <Cpt_phantom> Depends, I’ve seen some extremes. Was watching someone play DMC and only wanted to use Nero’s gun. Was weird
[4:06:07] <%Seancicle> gotta jet. au revoir
[4:06:10] <DatAsuna> oh boy that shroud bit
[4:06:11] <+kullumanati> The Sekiro play through was obviously painful and we all could see it on your face
[4:06:15] <xUrbanCarnage> Give yourself more credit you fuckin coward
[4:06:20] <roarofdamnation> I will never regret being on the Reggie team for Dokapon, he remains the best
[4:06:24] <TheRealGreaterGamer> We want you to experience EVERYTHING and to do it CORRECTLY Kappa
[4:06:40] <dds333a> People think they have answers they can Express to people they literally don't even know
[4:06:41] <penitentpendant> "Nope. you were answer 7 of 28. You're late to the game I'm afraid."
[4:06:43] <derap41> Reggie dominating those empathy roles
[4:06:44] <Tracazoid> "Do this thing I've been practicing for an extended period of time, new player."
[4:06:46] <%Kaito_Cam> Kaito_Cam subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 4 month streak! justice is real
[4:06:46] <%SirGO0SE> but I'm special and my thoughts are unique :)
[4:06:52] <%jinking79> The New Voices
[4:06:58] <xUrbanCarnage> The same ppl who say “you aren’t doing the dmc combos right” are the ones who haven’t perfected jump cancels
[4:07:03] <$emptyantics> “You have to do it MY WAY knxBAMA ”
[4:07:14] <dds333a> assumptions out of control
[4:07:25] <+monsieurfantastic> Reggie is the Armin of our world
[4:07:28] <+Jiggisnipe> if Woolie doesn't like m/kb, he doesn't like m/kb, very simple
[4:07:39] <+monsieurfantastic> best character
[4:07:54] <+samuraiknack> Just do it Woolie, perform for my amusement
[4:07:54] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts

[4:08:22] <TheRealGreaterGamer> I mean the great thing about Disco is there isnt any skill required :D
[4:08:31] <%saladin1911> Woolie's been in them Packinko mines huh?
[4:08:33] <Broand> I mean sure, I beat DMC4 on keyboard,
[4:08:44] <TheRealGreaterGamer> At worst you miss out on dialogue which sucks but will always be inevitable
[4:08:47] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ah so thrusday is divorce day, got it
[4:09:08] <+Malchiah_Tenabre> it's kinda great that you stuck at fps tbh. makes me feel better about how much I stuck at fighting games compared to you.
