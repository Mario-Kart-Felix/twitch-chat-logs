[0:03:52] <%emperordread> Cucked by popular demand for ReggieSouls
[0:03:56] <OldManDeckardCain> it's ok, isn't masochism already one of reggie's kinks?

[0:04:08] <%Javaa01> Well, at least DeS is the easiest one to start at, obtuse world mechanics aside
[0:04:08] <%dreadedcthulhu> I'm stoked on reggiesouls
[0:04:09] <%cache_22> I think Woolie should at least try out Astro's Playroom for himself I think.

[0:13:34] <@Solidus_113> black panther is the function

[0:14:02] <%Jack8274> X-men BibleThump
[0:14:07] <andre11dr> But then give me Loki
[0:14:08] <morphinomarshal> Boo!
[0:14:10] <morphinomarshal> Boo inhumans!
[0:14:10] <+BabyMakerNYC> X-Men are furries
[0:14:13] <Solidnick18> ughhh
[0:14:14] <+Dova573> I know the roster and arstyle sucks but I will forever defend Infinites gameplay
[0:14:16] <%Superbro64> I miss aussie Rocket doodSad
[0:14:16] <+Story_Ark> weird cause Nova isnt in any movies now or upcoming
[0:14:17] <morphinomarshal> I do like Lockjaw
[0:14:18] <@Solidus_113> never forget the adread
[0:14:19] <%jinking79> should've had Wolverine so their would had been hope for it
[0:14:23] <+kekkerscrew> as much as i love X-men they should really have their own Fighting game since there are too many
[0:14:24] <+Dova573> Best tag system
[0:14:25] <+b_aleph> InHuans are sick, stfu Woolie
[0:14:25] <+BabyMakerNYC> I bet woolie likes Static Shock.
[0:14:26] <%dreadedcthulhu> I was gna say black bolt the goat
[0:14:33] <%Malik1002> and his wife who i forget uhhhhhh red hair
[0:14:33] <@Menitta> Now I need to reinstall that 50+ gig game on my PS4
[0:14:33] <%yusefHD> I am just a younnnng blaaackboooolt~~ Goooo~~oood protect meeee.
[0:14:37] <tacostarvedbeast> i cant wait to see the reactions to yakuza
[0:14:37] <morphinomarshal> If he talks people die
[0:14:47] <%Jack8274> Play some Monster Hunter World to refresh Monster Hunter Kappa
[0:14:50] <andre11dr> They didn't even give us the cool Marvel caracters, it was just everyone from MVC3 again
[0:14:51] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> The idea that capcom had no negotiating power at all is farcical. Other marvel media came out that absolutely featured the xmen.
[0:14:57] <morphinomarshal> I think Woolie will fall in love with Kuze
[0:14:58] <+kekkerscrew> just make Children of the atom 2
[0:15:00] <%ozzrabbit> Oh come on, Lockjaw was awesome! You can’t hate a teleporting pupper!
[0:15:03] <morphinomarshal> Or should I say KUZE
[0:15:05] <%Superbro64> would you bring Max in and make it a For Glory GIFT? @woolieversus
[0:15:06] <Dante_Namikaze1> Black Bolt and Ms. Marvel should've been in
[0:15:13] <%CptnCampy61> Inhumans need to be put in recycle bin live on stage
[0:15:13] <+paladinstarbuster> FUCKIN YOOOOO
[0:15:13] <+cvp5127> fate PogChamp
[0:15:16] <+Dova573> Just give me a week to remember my combos woolz
[0:15:18] <%dreadedcthulhu> f8
[0:15:19] <%Lion_kun> Woolie you shilled the Inhumans TV show on the old podcast.
[0:15:20] <%Superbro64> GIFG, excuse me
[0:15:29] <andre11dr> Gonna play that weeb shit
[0:15:29] <%jiggy_snipe> Marvel didn't force Capcom to do anything but they probably asked/suggested they focus on certain characters
[0:15:35] <%jinking79> god Vergil and Dante JACKPOT super we could've gotten
[0:15:57] <%dreadedcthulhu> wasn't it just big house and genesis?
[0:16:00] <+Deko_> literally murderers
[0:16:00] <%Feralspirit41> Man nintendo went in blasting
[0:16:01] <dan_g_v> oh no
[0:16:03] <tacostarvedbeast> curb stomped indiscriminately, it what nintendo do
[0:16:04] <@Solidus_113> time for black market tourneys
[0:16:05] <+BabyMakerNYC> Until the stigma of Child Rape is gone. GG Nintendo.
[0:16:10] <%Jack8274> EA used to be that way back in the day
[0:16:11] <%dreadedcthulhu> summit still happened last weekend
[0:16:11] <morphinomarshal> Well Melee players haven't been on their best behaviour lately
[0:16:13] <OldManDeckardCain> PATTRACK
[0:16:13] <dan_g_v> Patrick?
[0:16:14] <%Feralspirit41> Nobody was spared
[0:16:14] <+Story_Ark> the only other company that has done this before, is Nintendo
[0:16:16] <+Doppio1089> like pat
[0:16:21] <@akuda_bar> woolieSMUG incidentally that was the exact conversation that this emote comes from @Lion_kun
[0:16:25] <Blank9> just don't have tournaments until pandemic is over, that's it
[0:16:28] <%yusefHD> BigBrain move is they're making a Smash Melee Anniversary for Switch
[0:16:31] <Solidnick18> LUL
[0:16:34] <redrins> its not that they want you to get it its that they wouldnt care LUL
[0:16:35] <JetpackMcQuack> Pays the mortgage
[0:16:35] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Who could that be
[0:16:36] <%dreadedcthulhu> that sounds like some mango shit lmoa
[0:16:37] <morphinomarshal> He's right tho
[0:16:37] <Tooniearcade> Lol Pat
[0:16:37] <+BabyMakerNYC> He's right
[0:16:38] <tacostarvedbeast> japan doesnt understand the internet part 22
[0:16:38] <%yusefHD> Nov 2021 bybee
[0:16:39] <andre11dr> Man everyone got really salty about WEWY yesterday, it was hilarious LUL
[0:16:39] <+Deko_> LUL
[0:16:39] <Prevot> LUL
[0:16:42] <%MKII> LUL
[0:16:44] <morphinomarshal> Why are you booing him? He's right
[0:16:45] <DracaenaLeaf> He's right Kappa
[0:16:46] <jonasislike> OH PAT LUL
[0:16:46] <Dante_Namikaze1> Pat was right
[0:16:47] <%jiggy_snipe> well Nintendo also didn't want Melee at Evo those years ago
[0:16:51] <JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[0:16:51] <%Jack8274> LUL
[0:16:52] <%Malik1002> POPULATION CONTROL
[0:16:52] <+Story_Ark> NEXT BIT
[0:16:57] <%CptnCampy61> It’s not incorrect
[0:16:57] <OldManDeckardCain> NINTENDO USES DOMINION SOFTWARE
[0:16:58] <+Beniial> they need to just give up on the piracy angle: its been proven time and time again that emulation is fine
[0:16:58] <%gatorafan> Pat with the Journalist takes
[0:16:59] <+LilNatFour> psaUp
[0:17:00] <linSP> Nintendo wants to kill gamers mariaUm
[0:17:02] <@Menitta> it is kinda incorrect
[0:17:04] <mexicansunglasses> Corporations ain't your friends Woolie
[0:17:05] <@Menitta> Kinda
[0:17:05] <%CommanderSqueaks> Man is a complete idiot, but loud so who knows?
[0:17:12] <+LandOfTheWay> your resistance only makes the bit stronger
[0:17:23] <sendart> nintendon't care about your health
[0:17:23] <morphinomarshal> CommanderSqueaks clearly someone who's that loud can only be right
[0:17:32] <@Solidus_113> Nintendo doesn't care
[0:17:42] <@Menitta> They can't prove the roms were legal or not
[0:17:43] <%jiggy_snipe> you have to dump the bios, back it up yourself and can't break any drm
[0:17:46] <andre11dr> Not for Nintendo
[0:17:53] <JetpackMcQuack> Literally just do nothing Nintendo
[0:17:58] <linSP> Nintendo is ABOVE the law
[0:18:01] <+Beniial> Melee isn't sold at all anymore, so they aren't benefiting even if you buy a second hand copy
[0:18:03] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> The case law in the US leans heavily in favor of the TOs here. But the legalities don't matter.
[0:18:05] <morphinomarshal> It's not worth going to court over really
[0:18:16] <Blank9> Broadcasting a modded version is a bit beyond backing up what you own.
[0:18:19] <@akuda_bar> not with coward lawyers like that one guy who told woolie not to do the woolieS woolieT thing
[0:18:24] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> That said, a single victory would put a stop to this shit
[0:18:29] <+Doppio1089> It is not about Melee being sold, it is about the brands being used
[0:18:32] <OldManDeckardCain> nintendo just made huge buck out of losers who bought their new limited scarce products, good luck suing them rich boys LUL
[0:18:34] <@Menitta> Lmao
[0:18:35] <andre11dr> Keep in mind Nintendo aren't just run by dinosaurs but Japanese dinosaurs witch is even worst
[0:18:37] <%yusefHD> I'd say to call Celino & Barnes, but one of them bois died in a plane crash
[0:18:40] <%Jack8274> Free cable? It's legal!
[0:18:43] <%ClericOfSparda> Nintendo should sell licenses to use the game rom for a tournament.
[0:18:45] <@akuda_bar> woolieF woolieU
[0:18:51] <%jinking79> don't get a tattoo with a # in it
[0:18:59] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> Sovereign citizen nonsense isn't grounded in any legalities.
[0:19:04] <$Invlux> Melee still exists Kappa just get Ultimate and only play Melee characters
[0:19:09] <morphinomarshal> Judge would tell both parties to go away and resolve the issue or come back in 6 months if you REALLY want to pursue legal action
[0:19:09] <%CommanderSqueaks> But Woolie I got the tattoo
[0:19:10] <%jiggy_snipe> yea sell the license for a nominal fee like $1
[0:19:22] <+Story_Ark> Woolie Madden: Attorney at Law
[0:19:30] <%Feralspirit41> Soverign citizenship is bullshit and im surprised it hasnt died out yet
[0:19:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> @feralspirit41 I am not.
[0:19:41] <andre11dr> OBJECTION!
[0:19:41] <%ninjanope_> ninjanope_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months!
[0:19:42] <morphinomarshal> Twitch and YouTube would NOT support the streamer, nor have they ever
[0:19:42] <%yusefHD> Jesuits? PogChamp
[0:19:57] <%alphalejandro> Woolie Ace Attorney
[0:20:10] <%Superbro64> That "Shut the F Up" video and the response afterwards scared you good, huh? @woolieversus
[0:20:11] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:20:14] <%jiggy_snipe> that sounds like it was the Yakuza wearing a mask
[0:20:16] <Shwepie> You mean when the yakuza showed up and said they own esports?
[0:20:23] <%Superbro64> it sucks when fans cant be fans of the thing they like
[0:20:35] <@Solidus_113> There was a quote from Iwata a long time ago, where he said something like "don't condemn fans who take your old works and find new ways to enjoy them".
[0:20:41] <Zeif00> who's gonna fuck with yakuza
[0:20:42] <@Solidus_113> I miss Iwata FeelsBadMan
[0:20:50] <%Jack8274> "Convinced" = Tojo Clan
[0:20:53] <+b_aleph> Majima owns esports
[0:20:55] <Shwepie> Iwata was a good boy.
[0:20:57] <%yusefHD> Would any of this happen if the Smash community wasn't batshit insane this year though?
[0:21:03] <%Superbro64> @solidus_113 He said: "We shouldn't treat fans who love our games like criminals"
[0:21:07] <%CommanderSqueaks> Majima would be far cooler about Esports if he was.
[0:21:08] <@Solidus_113> yeah
[0:21:10] <%jiggy_snipe> it would still happen
[0:21:10] <%Superbro64> Max read a quote on stream
[0:21:10] <JetpackMcQuack> It's all up in the air
[0:21:17] <+DigitalPelican> gotta get the dinosaurs out of nintendo
[0:21:22] <+zanzibar_junker> Yo bros
[0:21:38] <%jiggy_snipe> Nintendo hates other people using emulators and mods
[0:21:41] <+LilNatFour> They basically said that PM was stopping them from supporting the scene so people removed it and then Nintendo did nothing LUL
[0:21:44] <%yusefHD> Let me play as my Pikachu mapped as Ganondorf in peace tho
[0:21:44] <andre11dr> @jack8274 I mean some of the companies are straight up run by the Yakuza
[0:21:46] <Solidnick18> godzilla is in project m
[0:21:51] <Shwepie> @DigitalPelican They'll die off eventually, but they'll be replaced with new dinosaurs.
[0:21:53] <andre11dr> SEGA is at least
[0:21:56] <JetpackMcQuack> The fact that project M was mainstream was vital
[0:21:56] <$Invlux> Yakuza 8 with E-Sports management minigame
[0:21:58] <+LandOfTheWay> the takeaway lesson i'm getting here is that might (dollars) controls everything
[0:22:02] <@Menitta> LUL
[0:22:05] <+MajorCrasher> They should make it a law that if a company takes legal action against an individual, the company should have to pay for both sides' legal fees if they lose.
[0:22:06] <+Beniial> LUL
[0:22:10] <@Menitta> DAMN
[0:22:13] <%dreadedcthulhu> a friend of mine was top 50 in pm and just jumped ship to ultimate
[0:22:13] <GoogleyGareth> No?
[0:22:14] <Solidnick18> who
[0:22:15] <hamsterdavidson> the what?
[0:22:15] <%yusefHD> Brawlhalla community thriving
[0:22:17] <yagirlmayalazarus> Everybody started pulling out of PM because Nintendo told them that it was the reason they were staying out of Smash stuff and then did nothing when people stopping bringing up PM lol
[0:22:18] <%jinking79> fuck
[0:22:20] <HollowMan190> well back to playstion all stars
[0:22:22] <%gatorafan> The jacuzzies better get the right Daigo to own e-sports

[0:22:51] <%yusefHD> Starbucks smh
[0:22:53] <%Jack8274> Oh no...
[0:22:58] <+zanzibar_junker> The entertainment business is run by Yakuza because there is a cultural stigma in running entertainment because it's not honest hard work. Even during Feudal Japan.
[0:23:00] <%Jack8274> Mori?

[0:36:55] <SerRule1> Hey Woolie, so Hollywood has made some pretty bad anime remakes. At the same time, I think they're picking the wrong titles and not putting some love into it. What titles do you think would theoretically work as a hollywood remake?
[0:36:59] <Futurecity10> Hot take iron blooded season 2 is great
[0:37:02] <andre11dr> Zeta has a bunch of teen angst bullshit in it ,but it has enough cool shit to make it worth

[0:50:28] <tacostarvedbeast> i hope hades gets a enter the gungeon level of title update support
[0:50:29] <+immortanjoestar> maybe you just suck woolie
[0:50:33] <+immortanjoestar> lmao
[0:50:42] <CrematedCube> knowing how to game the upgrade system between runs speeds things up a great deal
[0:50:51] <JetpackMcQuack> Too early
[0:51:01] <tacostarvedbeast> @WoolieVersus this is pat when he tells u how monster hunter used to be
[0:51:05] <+b_aleph> Do it Reggie vs Hades then
[0:51:14] <%jiggy_snipe> as someone said, it's a weird reverse fomo
[0:51:15] <JetpackMcQuack> Epic got you again
[0:51:19] <glass_marcus> you got the start time wrong and left the party before everyone got there
[0:51:21] <heartlesshealer> It was worth it
[0:51:21] <%yusefHD> Hades is the horniest game in existence. Bonk.
[0:51:26] <+JinjaBreadMan757> All their games are quality af tho
[0:51:32] <resloxxx> Supergiants does good stuff
[0:51:35] <Blank9> how to make a game slowly and well received, unlike cyberpunk
[0:51:39] <heartlesshealer> It's greek mythology. Horny is built in
[0:51:41] <resloxxx> Red top tier gf
[0:51:42] <SerRule1> Hey Reggie! Talk about AEW!
[0:51:47] <Solidnick18> it's well earned
[0:51:49] <critfumble_> MEAN WHILE AT CDPRED
[0:51:49] <@Solidus_113> It's nice when Early Access games actually continue development and finish
[0:51:54] <%FuqBoiSlim> cyberpunk isn't out yet tho
[0:52:18] <brian_peppers1> more like a 100 times
[0:52:30] <hajnal_endot> i set hades on hard mode because i'm an xcom ironman masochist and it may have been a mistake
[0:52:32] <%SpiritOfOdin> SpiritOfOdin subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months!
[0:52:34] <%arancet> once i understood builds i never had a 'hopeless' run, i could always make something that worked
[0:52:41] <%Dapper_Cactuar> it's more Gungeon style now than Isaac style
[0:52:45] <primaryfire> once you beat it 1-3 times you'll be making it to the final area on every run
[0:52:52] <tacostarvedbeast> mini podcast? mopcast?
[0:53:11] <xXButtonMasher69Xx> tip jar
[0:53:15] <+paladinstarbuster> You could be doing better though

[0:53:25] <%Blazymaniac> i played it near its initial epic release and it took like 25 tries to get to the 2nd zone. now on release i cleared a run at attempt 25 or so
[0:53:27] <amychibi> woolie have you played SOLASTA Crown of the Magister ?
[0:53:32] <%bumpynavel> I know you're okay baby but I consume so much of your content I want to give a little more. Tips work I suppose.

[0:53:51] <+immortanjoestar> feet pics when
[0:53:52] <CrematedCube> I'm really curious if you can git gud enough by resetting the game constantly to beat it in a single run, and what would happen to the plot
[0:54:04] <@Solidus_113> Remember Vessel?
[0:54:15] <@akuda_bar> vessel who
[0:54:15] <%ken_kuma> Hey guys!
[0:54:18] <tacostarvedbeast> whats vessel?
[0:54:23] <heartlesshealer> vessel...
[0:54:24] <@Menitta> LUL
[0:54:25] <%arancet> better to create a 'product' than to be beholden to providing a 'service' to a small group
[0:54:28] <primaryfire> I remember having to watch linus tech tips videos on there
[0:54:29] <+Catbrainz> Reggieeeeee
[0:54:29] <OldManDeckardCain> it sure was asite
[0:54:30] <JetpackMcQuack> woolie dot net
[0:54:31] <critfumble_> speedrunners beat hades in a single run as a catagory, theres special dialogue for it too
[0:54:33] <ScreamLord> What that?
[0:54:34] <Clundy> Weasel?
[0:54:37] <@SoushinSen> vessels made woolie's throat sore.
[0:54:39] <hajnal_endot> vessel was cool, shame it didn't catch on
[0:54:40] <black_pariah> !woolie at risk!

[0:55:00] <%Javaa01> Vessel got bought out and immediately shut down
[0:55:01] <@Solidus_113> they got bought out by Verizon and died
[0:55:04] <%Livelinne> PrideShrug
[0:55:08] <Dante_Namikaze1> I've never heard of Vessel before
[0:55:08] <+JinjaBreadMan757> Vessel got berg'd
[0:55:09] <heartlesshealer> got hit below the waterline by Verizon
[0:55:16] <Solidnick18> cause people saw lp's before others
[0:55:17] <hajnal_endot> i also watch ltt, so vessel benefited me for multiple channels and so it was useful
[0:55:18] <extradopeness> Yeah I used Vessel to watch the DS3 LP
[0:55:23] <%cache_22> Manga vs. Anime 1.0

[0:55:46] <heartlesshealer> Minh's just doing stuff I'd think
[0:55:46] <NiktenKing> The actual words from Vessel: IT IS TIME TO SAY GOODBYE. WEQ WILL BE SUNSETTING VESSEL. VERIZON NO LONGER SUPPORTS US.
[0:55:49] <%Javaa01> Vessel was ad free
[0:55:52] <%FuqBoiSlim> no I don't remember any ads

[0:58:21] <%newtypetk> but thunderbolt tho
[0:58:25] <black_pariah> i've only seen IBO
[0:58:25] <InXplotch> just chatting?
[0:58:28] <Bluewolf544> Gundam is a fuck
[0:58:34] <Bluewolf544> but worth it in the end
[0:58:39] <@Menitta> 0079 is cool as fuck
[0:58:41] <%Seancicle> Reggie, how was Umbrella Academy?
[0:58:44] <trackles_64> Like hentai?
[0:58:45] <smyld> Gundam in 60 seconds
[0:58:51] <Parapattern> But Lumber Gundam tho
[0:58:55] <Blank9> maybe g gundam
[0:59:02] <trackles_64> Bible Black XD
[0:59:03] <%newtypetk> HAMBURGER
[0:59:04] <%ozzrabbit> When is EyepatchWolf going to tie Woolie to a chair and get him to finish Hunter X Hunter?
[0:59:06] <%jinking79> not everyone like Jojo
[0:59:08] <+RowenCleric> G Gundam is for everyone though, no exceptions
[0:59:09] <hajnal_endot> you mean you don't tell all your friends to rad Onani Master Kurosawa?
[0:59:11] <%Dapper_Cactuar> Gankutsuo is great but is trippy as hell
[0:59:11] <KaironFortressKnight> agreed, on that note everyone check out Garo
[0:59:17] <+b_aleph> Everybody should check out Yuri and Friends tho
[0:59:20] <%jinking79> till the memes comes in
[0:59:22] <KaironFortressKnight> damn good timing
[0:59:29] <SerRule1> I watched Parasyte: The Maxim just recently.
[0:59:34] <+JinjaBreadMan757> 08th MS Team is a good short gundam litmus test
[0:59:36] <@Menitta> Kamen Rider is hard to get into. Wasnt a fan of Ex Aid
[0:59:39] <+OmegaWeltall> Urotsukidōji ? KappaHD
[0:59:53] <Dante_Namikaze1> Speaking of Garo they had a huge sale for all the stuff they released in the west
[0:59:56] <andre11dr> I usually really just Stardust Memories by itself, it's the best classic one, and it has none of the angst, also it's 13 episodes
[0:59:58] <CrematedCube> There's the good old 3-episode anime test
[1:00:03] <%ken_kuma> @WoolieVersus Have you and or Reggie ever watched Tatami Galaxy? It's something close to my heart and I wanted to know someone else's thoughts on it.
[1:00:07] <redrins> ex aid is so freaking good tho
[1:00:08] <Manwad> what karas movie do I check out
[1:00:10] <hajnal_endot> Onani Master Kurosawa is about a teenager who jerks it in the girls' room and it becomes this harrowing look into the nature of humanity
[1:00:12] <KaironFortressKnight> I think the best beginner Kamen Rider is Kabuto.
[1:00:18] <%newtypetk> gaim tho
[1:00:21] <ScreamLord> Reggie ever seen Big O?
[1:00:23] <PanicSwytch> @jinjabreadman757 Definitely agree. 08th MS is 12 episodes and its one of the best
[1:00:34] <@Menitta> If you wanna get into Evangelion, watch End of Evangelion and see if you like it.
[1:00:40] <Dante_Namikaze1> @kaironfortressknight Double would be the best for beginner stuff
[1:00:48] <$arcielardor> Start him on G Gundam!
[1:00:53] <%Lion_kun> War in the Pocket ie a good starter.
[1:00:55] <%psidefx> I got introduced to mecha feat heavy politics then bounced off hard
[1:00:57] <Bluewolf544> I do that too but cant help myself from recommending jojo to anyone with even a remote interest in anime
[1:00:59] <+Daxalog> 6 episodes too long
[1:01:14] <jonasislike> gunbustaa
[1:01:15] <%ekodrop> early gunbuster scares people away
[1:01:24] <andrewofbob> A thing my anime society had was to show the 1st episode from some older shows
[1:01:24] <%alphalejandro> watch Getter Armageddon
[1:01:34] <WaifusSansFrontieres> listen man, I love one piece, how do you think I feel living this existence
[1:01:34] <@Menitta> That's why its easier to get into stuff like Ghost in the Shell since it starts with a movie
[1:01:37] <%Jetzord> jojo

[1:02:54] <+Lewdicrus00Q> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[1:02:54] <black_pariah> its a good show, but its peak 2000s

[1:02:55] <%alphalejandro> watch Devilman Crybaby
[1:02:56] <+cvp5127> watch monogatari Kappa
[1:03:01] <heartlesshealer> Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya
[1:03:02] <@SoushinSen> i have no recollection of recommending it to Reggie.
[1:03:05] <tacostarvedbeast> what show?
[1:03:06] <OldManDeckardCain> woolie is just jealous it has a better god Kappa
[1:03:07] <%cache_22> AngriestWoolie has come to.

[1:03:09] <Bluewolf544> Play dmc 2 - Minh
[1:03:10] <+wicketpelican> Woolie watched Crybaby dude
[1:03:10] <andre11dr> If people ask me to get into Gundam i guide them to 8 MS,War In the Pocket or 0083 Stardust Memories
[1:03:12] <%Superbro64> @soushinsen Kappa
[1:03:15] <xXButtonMasher69Xx> haru all worth it for the movie imo. Time loop was dumb tho
[1:03:16] <CrematedCube> I've never watched it, but the timeline bullshit fascinates me
[1:03:17] <%Seancicle> objection, point of order
[1:03:18] <+b_aleph> Watch Alexis Texas' I Have a Wife
[1:03:24] <Bluewolf544> @SoushinSen Kappa
[1:03:24] <%dreadedcthulhu> the push always makes it worse
[1:03:30] <%TaylorIsGood> There are shows I would do that for but Haruhi is soooo far from one of those shows
[1:03:31] <hajnal_endot> trapeze is the best show
[1:03:32] <TigerClaws12> Minh didn't ask for anime consent, that's a crime
[1:03:34] <andre11dr> Watch Devil Lady
[1:03:35] <%arancet> they are random order yeah
[1:03:37] <WaifusSansFrontieres> it sucks that one piece is like, one of the best things ever but people are scared of the sheer girth
[1:03:37] <@SoushinSen> i talked about it, i don't remmber RECOMMENDING
[1:03:41] <SerRule1> Watch 'Mystic Pop-up Bar'. It's a k-drama.
[1:03:42] <Tuna_Can_0> binty ples plai dee em cee 2 bast gam
[1:03:42] <%FuqBoiSlim> I never watched Haruhi but I remember thinking Nagato was cute gwdStare
[1:03:43] <+Dova573> whats haruhi?
[1:03:47] <Bluewolf544> Devil girl cry woman
[1:03:50] <+aragaojunior> @b_aleph doodNuts
[1:03:53] <+wicketpelican> Haruhi is deep weeb shit that isn't relevant anymore due to it being a genre creator but at the same time completely average in nowadays standards.
[1:03:53] <+zanzibar_junker> Exactly
[1:03:55] <andre11dr> Devil Lady fucking rules
[1:03:57] <%Razputin217> Endless Eight inochiRip
[1:03:57] <OldManDeckardCain> just like third birthday, eh?
[1:03:59] <NeroInfinite> HAruhi is wierd they just have like theinfintie summer shit as mutiple episodes
[1:04:02] <@SoushinSen> Reggie, ythe anime you requested from me are still on the Editing PC.
[1:04:06] <tacostarvedbeast> yea nothing worse than trying to enjoy something with expectations attached. im here to relax not make you feel better about liking a thing
[1:04:09] <%arancet> @Dova573 melancholy of haruhi suzumiya or something like that
[1:04:11] <DublinRage> is KoNoSuBa low commitment?
[1:04:11] <%dreadedcthulhu> lucky star is Haruhi but good
[1:04:11] <+zanzibar_junker> LoGH Sea of the Stars is a good start
[1:04:12] <black_pariah> @SoushinSen have you ever seen Symphogear?
[1:04:13] <+Dova573> oh
[1:04:18] <@Menitta> I do remember after Mecha Week, your blanket recommendation was just watch thwe Big O
[1:04:18] <%FuqBoiSlim> @dova573 the melon-colony of Haroohi Suzy Spherehunter
[1:04:22] <%Klefth> Why is it that any time they're going into a story and Minh is involved, I immeditately expect it to be some bullshit?
[1:04:23] <KaironFortressKnight> has Reggie played the DMC series out of curiosity?
[1:04:27] <%ekodrop> that movie isn't representative of the various series...
[1:04:29] <jonasislike> Macross YEYEYE
[1:04:34] <%Reverend_Roscoe> DO YOU RMEMENBER LOVE IS AWFUL
[1:04:37] <%psidefx> Had Haruhi and lucky star pushed, I only enjoyed one character then dropped both
[1:04:43] <+Jaysky> Gurren is usually a solid recommend
[1:04:44] <+wicketpelican> Try recommending Legend of the Galactic Heroes. Its crazy good but holy shit 110 episodes.
[1:04:46] <Shwepie> Wasn't Haruhi that anime that had twelve episodes that were the same episode but not really?
[1:04:46] <andre11dr> Big O is some fire shit
[1:04:48] <%ken_kuma> I think one trope that gets me into a show, specifically a shonen- is when there's a part where it's the whole squad even the B-listers against just one tough dude.
[1:04:50] <%Blazymaniac> watch one piece, just start at episode 1
[1:04:51] <jonasislike> Do you remember love is better than tv series
[1:04:54] <WaifusSansFrontieres> right this very moment I want people to play 13 sentinels, but a 30-60 hour visual novel is a HARD sell
[1:04:55] <extradopeness> Endless Waltz got me into not-G Gundam
[1:04:58] <Bluewolf544> Gurren lagaan is MUCH better when you know its influences
[1:05:02] <KaironFortressKnight> mmmm vagabond
[1:05:03] <@akuda_bar> vagabond so fuckin good tho
[1:05:05] <ScreamLord> My method is. "Hey dude, wanna check this thing out?" if they say yes "do you wanna see more of thing?" if they say no at any point "ok"
[1:05:08] <OldManDeckardCain> do you hate proper endings? read vagabond Kappa
[1:05:10] <%Reverend_Roscoe> YOU THROW SAGA AND VAGABOND AT US CONSTANTLY
[1:05:10] <PanicSwytch> I always recommend Steins Gate and Tower of God
[1:05:10] <%fritz_dacat> I gotta reread sage its been to long
[1:05:12] <+zanzibar_junker> Give someone a Gunpla
[1:05:14] <%dreadedcthulhu> I didnt get lucky star when I first watched it at 14 and rewatching it at 26 I loved it way more
[1:05:14] <+GrooovinMagic> @wicketpelican Get them to check out My Conquest is the Sea of Stars
[1:05:14] <tacostarvedbeast> woolie does it best, he plants the seed, and then 4 years later u watch legend of the galatic hero and think 'holy shit woolie was 100 percent right'
[1:05:15] <Parapattern> Big O is fucking rad, but damn they did not stick the landing on that series
[1:05:16] <@SoushinSen> Reggie, You wanted Hikaru No Go, Goblin Slayer, and I recommende Hanebado! (because ouy like sports anime)
[1:05:16] <%FuqBoiSlim> Woolie, you read Slam Dunk?
[1:05:21] <+aragaojunior> macross do you remember love doodThirst
[1:05:23] <+b_aleph> Lone Wolf and Cub > Vagabond
[1:05:25] <NeroInfinite> There isn't any test forjojo yeah
[1:05:28] <+paladinstarbuster> The OVA
[1:05:33] <That_Mojo> my test for jojo ended on part 2 newyork, rip
[1:05:34] <@Menitta> LUL The OVA
[1:05:34] <+JinjaBreadMan757> JoJo is all the way in or nothing
[1:05:35] <cholongkh> cum
[1:05:37] <+Jaysky> It's flawed
[1:05:37] <trackles_64> The first season of JoJO is ok
[1:05:38] <hajnal_endot> actually, i know a show that fails the three episode test but is sstill excellent: yurikuma arashi
[1:05:40] <%Jack8274> Everyone bounces off Jojo at first
[1:05:41] <TigerClaws12> hell yea the OVA
[1:05:41] <mihokspawn> There is a test for JoJo's ROHAN
[1:05:41] <linSP> bro just watch all of jojo
[1:05:41] <+Beniial> just hold them at gunpoint until they enjoy it
[1:05:42] <brian_peppers1> Where the fuck do I even start with JoJo?
[1:05:46] <That_Mojo> my friends tapped out there i mean
[1:05:46] <+Daxalog> Have you seen the stick figure dropping a road roller? Want context? Here.
[1:05:47] <Solidnick18> yeah it's hard to determine
[1:05:50] <+Dova573> the pain of not being able to sell friends on one piece
[1:05:51] <DracaenaLeaf> the memes oversell Part 3 :(
[1:05:53] <+GrooovinMagic> @brian_peppers1 Part 1
[1:05:53] <hajnal_endot> yurikuma arashi doesn't work until episode 4
[1:05:53] <%Klefth> As a JoJo fan, JoJo is hard to recommend
[1:05:55] <%Jack8274> @brian_peppers1 Part 1
[1:05:56] <Bluewolf544> Just watch Jojo you have no choice
[1:05:56] <jamesthebrave> THAT'S THE WORST
[1:05:57] <+Jaysky> I have one friend who INSISTS I NEED to watched ALL of Jojo
[1:05:58] <NeroInfinite> Show them Zepplie from part 1 and see how they feel. LUL
[1:06:00] <@Solidus_113> One Piece
[1:06:00] <%dreadedcthulhu> @brian_peppers1 part 1
[1:06:01] <+paladinstarbuster> The OVA is unironically better than part 3
[1:06:01] <OldManDeckardCain> "does this person look like they'd pose randomly in private?"
[1:06:02] <jonasislike> U can just watch phantom blood if U like that go to part 2
[1:06:02] <PKSomething> I showed a friend Part 2 to begin with and he said he would be down to see more of it
[1:06:03] <+b_aleph> @brian_peppers1 part 6
[1:06:04] <primaryfire> the game gets good 25 hours in bro
[1:06:05] <andre11dr> My test is watch the first episode of Part 2 and if you love it YOUR IN
[1:06:07] <KaizaMcBold> eben they Like the pants Ther in
[1:06:08] <JetpackMcQuack> Araki's good at boiling the frog
[1:06:10] <Parapattern> The art style of JoJo makes me sick to my stomach. I don't know why.
[1:06:10] <KaironFortressKnight> dude get to season 3
[1:06:11] <%psidefx> Jojo either your in or you're not
[1:06:15] <tacostarvedbeast> hunter x hunter took 14 episodes to really kick in for me
[1:06:17] <@Menitta> I'm like that with Nier Automata. The first 15 hours are kinda boring imo
[1:06:18] <NeetKiller> I felt that way about HxH
[1:06:19] <ScreamLord> Episode 8 WutFace
[1:06:19] <Zeif00> it happens
[1:06:19] <heartlesshealer> people tried to get my best friend into Jojo too fucking soon and spoiled the hell out of it and now he doesn't want to read/watch it at all. ;___;
[1:06:21] <%Seancicle> OSFrog
[1:06:21] <@Menitta> but the last 35 tho
[1:06:24] <%Klefth> YOU HEAR THAT ONE PIECE FANS?
[1:06:26] <+Deko_> i got a friend into jojo by making them watch the abridged part 1+2
[1:06:27] <Clundy> It’s the equivalent of “Oh FFX111 gets so good after hour 80!@“
[1:06:31] <Wind_Burst> HxH is the ultimate "just get to chimera ant"
[1:06:32] <WaifusSansFrontieres> @WoolieVersus can you fault people that drop gurren at episode 4?
[1:06:39] <%LCLSmoothie> LCLSmoothie subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 2 month streak! woolie time
[1:06:39] <%ekodrop> with some stuff it's more like until it gets to that part things don't make sense
[1:06:40] <jonasislike> ENNIS LOBBY THO
[1:06:42] <+Dova573> Nah woolie even actual HxH dosent get good till after the beggining is done
[1:06:46] <OldManDeckardCain> I SWEAR FF1
[1:06:48] <jamesthebrave> The opposite of that feeling is when somebody is watching a thing you really like and they ask you "Hey so when does this get good" PAIN
[1:06:51] <$arcielardor> For Reggie, wasn't there some kind of Foot stand in part 4?
[1:06:52] <KaironFortressKnight> automata is a hard recommend cuz of that
[1:06:52] <JetpackMcQuack> People are busy
[1:06:53] <+PapaGravestone> i told my wife about darling in the franxx back when it was good. i apologize to her often. redeemed myself by getting her into gurren laggan and gridman though.
[1:06:55] <Qsmash_> the second episode of 90's HxH added filler
[1:07:03] <%jinking79> Stein gate has that problem too
[1:07:03] <jonasislike> HXH 1999 had some dumb fillers
[1:07:04] <%FuqBoiSlim> One Piece twitter stans are weirdoes you can watch 100 episode, say you didn't like it and they'll say "You didn't watch enough bro"
[1:07:05] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @OldManDeckardCain
[1:07:07] <+JinjaBreadMan757> Even the new series of Hunter x Hunter took me til they got to the "fight" with the prisoners before i was like Ohhhhhh
[1:07:10] <WaifusSansFrontieres> what do you gyus mean? if you read the manga one piece is good from the start
[1:07:22] <+Jaysky> There's a lot of shows where it only takes 1-2 eps
[1:07:23] <+Dova573> Hxh Weakest part is the beginning manga or anime wise
[1:07:26] <glass_marcus> All of one piece is good, ALL OF IT
[1:07:30] <andre11dr> HxH fucking draaaags till it gets to the tournament
[1:07:38] <Bluewolf544> JOJO technically needs you to get to part 2
[1:07:39] <+zanzibar_junker> Robot anime is the fighting games of anime
[1:07:40] <NeroInfinite> They hype killed KLK for me.
[1:07:43] <WaifusSansFrontieres> @FuqBoiSlim because of bad anime pacing, yeah
[1:07:47] <+Dova573> Yeah bleach starts strong
[1:07:50] <brian_peppers1> Bleached tricked us all
[1:07:52] <OldManDeckardCain> what
[1:07:53] <%fritz_dacat> hallow
[1:07:53] <Prevot> bleach was never good
[1:07:55] <bloopmainbtw> bleach has a strong thesis statement
[1:07:56] <%arancet> bleach at start is great
[1:07:56] <JetpackMcQuack> Worked on me
[1:07:57] <mihokspawn> Angler
[1:08:01] <jamesthebrave> The first arc and Soul Society arc are SUPER GOOD
[1:08:06] <OldManDeckardCain> it wasn't a big one LUL
[1:08:06] <%nimu290> bleach was cool until it wasn't
[1:08:07] <%Klefth> @glass_marcus Yes, nothing like having a fucking announcer spend over 10 minutes of an episode monologuing about flashbacks or some shit
[1:08:07] <andre11dr> I have never seen Bleach
[1:08:09] <%dreadedcthulhu> new bleach has that same effect (jujutsu kaisen)
[1:08:12] <TigerClaws12> LUL
[1:08:14] <%Jack8274> We all love Soul Society, then it kept going
[1:08:16] <Prevot> I researched early bleach a while ago and that shit sucked from the start
[1:08:18] <redrins> grand fisher
[1:08:19] <CrematedCube> Bleach started solid but lost focus
[1:08:19] <resloxxx> LUL
[1:08:19] <+Jaysky> Naruto nearly gets his ass killed
[1:08:20] <Dante_Namikaze1> it was just a Hollow
[1:08:21] <+RunoEddie> I wouldn't say the beginning of HxX drags, at least the manga, it just isn't the 11 out of 10 that later parts get
[1:08:27] <jamesthebrave> Y'know what are surprisingly great? The Bleach anime movies. Good shit all round.
[1:08:27] <%ken_kuma> We live in a Soul Society
[1:08:30] <%Gasgrave> Why not force Ergo Proxy on someone? It's easy to get into.
[1:08:30] <%fritz_dacat> Now go watch Konosuba
[1:08:35] <hajnal_endot> we adult swim in here
[1:08:36] <%dreadedcthulhu> my threshold is usually 3
[1:08:39] <@Solidus_113> Soul Eater takes 4 episodes to introduce the characters
[1:08:39] <PanicSwytch> The Bount saga suuuuuucks
[1:08:42] <OldManDeckardCain> bleach pre soul society was the best, CHANGE MY MIND
[1:08:44] <300coolfactsaboutbears> Time to shill HxH.
[1:08:47] <%Jack8274> The best Bleach is "Bleach: Dark Souls"
[1:08:47] <+Jaysky> Ergo Proxy is NOT easy to get into what the hell
[1:08:47] <bloopmainbtw> don't watch bleach filler
[1:08:54] <PkSilent01> !sechdule
[1:08:55] <bloopmainbtw> that shit the big bad
[1:08:59] <PkSilent01> !schedule
[1:08:59] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1331278873527525386?s=20
[1:09:00] <NeroInfinite> Ergo Proxy was ROUGH
[1:09:00] <emeraldskrull> 6 is half a season! If you don't get me in 3 eps i'm out!
[1:09:00] <%ekodrop> damn reggie is patient
[1:09:01] <Bluewolf544> PogChamp
[1:09:01] <+RunoEddie> Gintama takes more than 20 episodes to become amazing lmao
[1:09:03] <+Deko_> its too good
[1:09:04] <%johnny_gogo> me and my friend had to watch upto like 6 or 7 on demon slayer before it grabed us
[1:09:15] <+cvp5127> 6 is too much
[1:09:17] <jonasislike> The bleach live action is definite bleach experience
[1:09:19] <hajnal_endot> anyway, Kuuchuu Buranko is about an insane psychiatrist and his normal patients and is an incredibly in-depth and sympathetic portrayal of mental health issues
[1:09:21] <%Gasgrave> That's the joke
[1:09:21] <%newtypetk> can we put reggie on the Thunderbolt section tho?
[1:09:30] <WaifusSansFrontieres> I read one piece twice
[1:09:39] <linSP> pat hates the dip
[1:09:40] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:09:40] <a_mad_dragon> episode 4 frightened me, i thought they had blown their budget on the first three episodes and 4 was what the rest would be like
[1:09:41] <+zanzibar_junker> Gaogaigar has the best gattai sequence in all of anime
[1:09:42] <resloxxx> The time skip Kreygasm
[1:09:44] <hajnal_endot> and it never got licensed because there is no justice
[1:09:46] <%baka_sugoi> too much weeb stuff
[1:09:53] <+Fantion> felt that
[1:09:54] <brian_peppers1> A buffet of mediocrity
[1:09:58] <+zanzibar_junker> Final Fusion is iconic
[1:09:59] <300coolfactsaboutbears> Time to shill Nuclear Throne.
[1:10:01] <DracaenaLeaf> Lewd
[1:10:21] <%nimu290> yeah i feel off myself
[1:10:27] <%nimu290> fell
[1:10:28] <@akuda_bar> understand, understand
[1:10:31] <andre11dr> Yu Yu Hakusho starts out pretty mediocre and then it becomes ",holy shit" But you gotta get past the shit
[1:10:37] <%fritz_dacat> Now get into Webcomics
[1:10:43] <+Jaysky> @johnny_gogo I only started to care when they introduced the demon lord guy in the city. Before then it felt generic as hell.
[1:10:46] <@Menitta> "I'm trying to get into Netflix"
[1:10:48] <+zanzibar_junker> Watch Votoms
[1:10:49] <NeroInfinite> I got into harmeanime via thatreverseharemanime that came out earlier in theyear.
[1:10:49] <@SoushinSen> Reggie, did oyu end up watching 1 Liter of Tears?
[1:10:56] <jamesthebrave> Having shit going on really makes me appreciate long ass JRPGs. It's nice to be able to come back to the same story and characters for a while to have fun for a bit. Instead of having to jump between a bunch of different ones cuz they're all super short.
[1:10:57] <bloopmainbtw> BUT DEATH NOTE THO?
[1:10:59] <%dklordg> YOU HAVENT SEEN DEATH NOTE?
[1:11:00] <agianttornado> My buddy thought that Megalobox 1st episode was too slow, how do I help convvince him when something is only 10-12 epsisodes? @WoolieVersus
[1:11:01] <%Klefth> YOU!? YOU haven't seen Death Note!? @WoolieVersus
[1:11:02] <WaifusSansFrontieres> @fritz_dacat burning effect would make him very happy I think
[1:11:02] <redrins> kamen rider is a commitement
[1:11:04] <+zanzibar_junker> Chirico is Hero Yuu but better
[1:11:04] <NiktenKing> YOU HAVEN'T SEEN DEATH NOTE - Lima Bean
[1:11:09] <TheHoody> I watched Yu Yu Hakusho for the first time this year
[1:11:13] <Jashter18> Kamen Rider is ALOT
[1:11:15] <@Menitta> YOU DIDNT WATCH SPONGEBOB
[1:11:21] <Qsmash_> what is this conversation even about?
[1:11:22] <%fritz_dacat> @WaifusSansFrontieres agreed
[1:11:22] <Lieutori> Decade happens to be pretty short compared to other ones at least
[1:11:24] <+GrooovinMagic> I'm more jealous when someone tells me they've never seen a show I love.
[1:11:24] <300coolfactsaboutbears> YOU HAVEN'T READ ULYSSES
[1:11:25] <%Dapper_Cactuar> be an advisor not a gatekeeper
[1:11:25] <Dante_Namikaze1> YOU HAVEN'T SEEN DEATH NOTE
[1:11:30] <emeraldskrull> catch yo' ass up on your catdog lore
[1:11:31] <brian_peppers1> SAMURAI JACK and Megas XLR were amazing
[1:11:34] <+RunoEddie> I understand perfectly where Woolie is coming from, I really do, time is the most precious resource that exists, but it does end up sometimes filtering out the incredibly amazing slow burns
[1:11:35] <KaironFortressKnight> you didn't read THE BIBLE
[1:11:40] <%dreadedcthulhu> I miss invader zim
[1:11:40] <%Seancicle> when someone hasn't seen thing my friend says, "that can be rectified".
[1:11:41] <$arcielardor> Kamen Rider Ghost
[1:11:41] <%ken_kuma> Anybody been reading Record of Ragnarok?
[1:11:43] <fuji_92> YOU HAVENT SEEN RUGRATS
[1:11:43] <%Klefth> @Qsmash_ How some people don't know how to recommend anime
[1:11:45] <%FuqBoiSlim> Bro bro it gets good at fruit cake isles I swear to God bro you just gotta read more bro pls I'm so lonely pleaAAASE
[1:11:45] <@Menitta> Invader Zim is fire
[1:11:47] <%jepupu> jepupu subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months!
[1:11:48] <FrostySnowQueen> Woolie's childhood was robbed
[1:11:50] <andre11dr> And then there's One Piece and it's 800 volumes
[1:11:52] <WaifusSansFrontieres> you never played YAKUZA?!
[1:11:53] <%Jack8274> LUL

[1:31:27] <Prevot> I did the galaxy 1 version of this where you use bob-ombs and it was fucking bullshit
[1:31:32] <+skyheys> "this is bullshit!" -half his fireballs hit nothing
[1:31:36] <glass_marcus> the amount of fire balls you throw isn't important, the angle and position is what you need to focus on
[1:31:40] <%xcompleasedad> @WoolieVersus You have penetrating shots. I think
[1:31:41] <exnuart> the fireball goes through all them
[1:31:42] <@Menitta> Galaxy 1 had the trash bob omb one
[1:31:45] <ShiningAxis> try going to the side and firing in lines
[1:31:51] <+skyheys> @lots__ yep, it was even worse
[1:31:53] <%alphalejandro> @LotS__ Yes, but it was with bombs i believe
[1:31:55] <missingangle> I feel like the bob omb one is worse imo
[1:31:58] <SuperRafiMan> Gotta angle yourself
[1:32:13] <+skyheys> Why does he throw like ten?
[1:32:16] <@Menitta> That was close
[1:32:32] <%xcompleasedad> Don't spam shots. You have penetration @WoolieVersus
[1:32:32] <andrewofbob> Get to one side and wipe it

[1:33:02] <Wind_Burst> don't spam fireballs in the same direction to save time
[1:33:04] <+starzo0> @starzo0 it'll prob drop down to like ten bucks next steam sale if youre on pc, coulnd tell you about console, but i bet it be similar

[2:02:49] <@akuda_bar> yeah but they don't pause your game with it like they used to @Jaysky
[2:03:02] <+Jaysky> Oooh then
[2:03:05] <%dreadedcthulhu> instantaneous 5 inch snowfall
[2:03:11] <%dreadedcthulhu> all at once
[2:03:36] <%FuqBoiSlim> didn't the 3ds port of starfox 64 pause your game to tell you to take a break or am I just crazy?
[2:03:37] <CrematedCube> Sound like Texas rain, except as snow
[2:03:38] <%LCLSmoothie> los angeles winter is just 50 F days with foggy days haha
[2:03:59] <%FuqBoiSlim> I hate snow because it always makes everything bright af in the mornings
[2:04:44] <+Jaysky> My city has no clue what it wants to do. First it was summer weather, then it flash snowed, then it was freezing tem0s, then summer for 3 weeks.
[2:04:52] <%kulmoth> SCHLOWER
[2:04:54] <+Jaysky> Now it's freezing rsin
[2:04:58] <+Jaysky> *rain

[2:11:19] <%LCLSmoothie> @ozzrabbit i played that with my brother, we nearly murderd each other bc we fighting how the puzzles should work

[2:14:05] <Zebroneath> that's half the fucking game LUL
[2:14:05] <Prevot> are these robots offering lewd services?
[2:14:05] <@Menitta> Finally. Sonic Leashed
[2:14:05] <+Beniial> There's a mod for Sonic Generations that ports all the day levels
[2:14:34] <%psidefx> Banger tho
[2:14:37] <Cynical_Canadian> Oh boy this one gave me a lot of trouble when I first played
[2:14:43] <andrewofbob> Werehog is a children’s character action game
[2:14:45] <CrematedCube> PTSD flashbacks of the handheld Sonic special levels
[2:14:53] <300coolfactsaboutbears> He's got a buddy at the end to "take care" of Mario once he gets his money.
[2:14:59] <Prevot> fucking spaggos
[2:15:03] <%nimu290> rooftop runs?
[2:15:03] <%Th3SmartAlec> ah yes, the Spaggos

[2:15:10] <%psidefx> The Spagos
[2:15:12] <%SideChar> ah, yes
[2:15:15] <%Zayasu> D:
[2:15:16] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[2:15:17] <@akuda_bar> you can't say spago, spago is our word
[2:15:20] <%cache_22> I miss Mr. Snip-snip.
[2:15:25] <%FuqBoiSlim> GET THAT SPAGGY BITCH OF THE PLANE
[2:15:28] <Cynical_Canadian> And the one that went too far for even Matt, SPAG
[2:15:30] <glass_marcus> One of my favorite LPs, shame about the ending
[2:15:36] <%wibbwobbler> UnSane
[2:15:39] <BlackermanZX> Rooftop Run?
[2:15:42] <@akuda_bar> there used to be a store in massachusetts called Spags and it always sounded a little rude
[2:15:43] <%dreadedcthulhu> probably rooftop run?
[2:15:46] <SomersaultJustice> I have a variant but I don't want to say it
[2:15:47] <Self_esteampunk> that opening cinematic tho
[2:15:48] <passserby> the Result E music is the best thing sonic unleashed brought
[2:15:55] <%ChoculaUltra> werehog? did I walk into another sonic discussion
[2:15:57] <notsoy> even the shittiest sonics have had at least a few bangers
[2:16:02] <EliahNebb> amazing how anyone can say 'werehog' without laughing
[2:16:06] <Self_esteampunk> I actually like the werehog levels
[2:16:10] <%LCLSmoothie> that jazz battle music was something
[2:16:16] <@Menitta> Sonic Unleashed is a remnant of the era where LITERALLY EVERY SERIES tried to do God of War
[2:16:20] <+starzo0> @notsoy the theme from seven rings is my shit
[2:16:38] <Prevot> and now not even God of War is doing God of War
[2:16:46] <%Josef_Stryker> I have a soft spot for Unleashed
[2:16:50] <Prevot> funny how things change
[2:16:54] <SomersaultJustice> Slider
[2:16:59] <PhantomMaskJr> You missed absolutely nothing Reggie larxaDitch
[2:17:18] <+quackisalive> Is this sonic?
[2:17:18] <%FuqBoiSlim> Do you someone tried to make a Sonic Unleashed Werehog combo MAD back in 2008 and they just couldn't...
[2:17:27] <BlackermanZX> Werehog would have been slightly better without having these long ass levels
[2:17:35] <BlackermanZX> and that goddamn repetitive battle song
[2:17:39] <@Menitta> Even Castlevania tried to God of War
[2:17:43] <+Beniial> 🎺
[2:17:50] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[2:17:51] <Prevot> fake mario fan
[2:17:52] <+Jaysky> Wii version had shorter levels
[2:17:54] <andrewofbob> The other day we were talking about the length of eggmanland
[2:18:03] <%dreadedcthulhu> me too reggie
[2:18:10] <Prevot> reggie's a fucking mario secondary
[2:18:11] <+firmlygraspi1> thats Metal Gear music for me XD
[2:18:24] <300coolfactsaboutbears> Reggie being filthy.
[2:18:29] <+Jaysky> He'll, Unleashed was basically two games from Wii to 360/ps3
[2:18:33] <Cynical_Canadian> Having a 2nd player REALLY helps here, wow
[2:18:35] <+Jaysky> *Hell
[2:18:40] <aru42> the double line aint bad if you get off it quickly
[2:18:41] <+Beniial> Mario's my favorite Smash spinoff, up there with Fire Emblem
[2:18:51] <@Menitta> I played Unleashed on Wii so I have more positive memories of that game
[2:18:58] <glass_marcus> Between both versions of unleashed there is an actually good game there
[2:19:07] <Cynical_Canadian> You just die if you don't get 100, Gold Rosalina popped up when I did this level
[2:19:23] <%FuqBoiSlim> Hey when is that Captain Falcon dude gonna get his own game?
[2:19:26] <BlackermanZX> i played the ps2 version first and then the 360 and holy shit its so different
[2:19:29] <300coolfactsaboutbears> Sonic Colors on the DS was better than Colors on the Wii.
[2:19:40] <glass_marcus> @300coolfactsaboutbears Facts
[2:20:04] <exnuart> too safe
[2:20:04] <%LCLSmoothie> this robot is pissing me off

[2:20:34] <NotHereToStream> maybe in your next life mario
[2:20:35] <%LCLSmoothie> FAILURE IS NOT A OPTION
[2:20:35] <%johnny_gogo> cyanide bill
[2:20:41] <CrematedCube> Honor before death
[2:20:42] <+Jaysky> I loved the first few fast levels of Unleashed on Wii, even if it's flawed
[2:20:52] <%FuqBoiSlim> Aww so close! too bad! shofuBlam
[2:20:56] <%psidefx> Bowser Wins *hehehehe*
[2:20:58] <+Jaysky> Later levels get obnoxious
[2:20:58] <BlackermanZX> mario was murdered in cold blood that day for his failure
[2:21:01] <Cynical_Canadian> "This game was rigged from the start" - Gizmo
[2:21:05] <%Th3SmartAlec> nah man Luigi pulls a Simon just you watch
[2:21:21] <andrewofbob> Capitalism is the final Lawful Evil
[2:21:28] <300coolfactsaboutbears> They are unfeeling machines.
[2:21:35] <+Jaysky> Fuck Eggmanland (it looked cool tho)
[2:22:18] <%FuqBoiSlim> I dont think I got past Holaska on either version of the game tbh. which is weird cause 8 year old me loved sonic
[2:22:18] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:22:20] <aru42> go right from the line it's easier
[2:22:21] <@Menitta> Eggmanland was some shit
[2:22:26] <andrewofbob> Greed
[2:22:33] <+firmlygraspi1> I wish you could make these slides in Mario Maker
[2:22:38] <Cynical_Canadian> Eggmanland was terrible in both the Ps3/Xbox and Wii/PS2 versions
[2:22:48] <+Jaysky> I remember wanting to chuck my controller eggmanland
[2:22:56] <+Jaysky> *at
[2:23:08] <big_booty_animemilf> SO TIGHT
[2:23:13] <%cache_22> Style points though.
[2:23:15] <+Jaysky> Holaska I think was fun? Sand level was dope
[2:23:38] <+Jaysky> Good music overall especially the final boss but that's par for the Sonic course
[2:23:45] <+LotS__> "Nice work!" *pulls out gun*
[2:23:53] <+kewlmyc> "Do better next time". *gunshot*
[2:23:57] <mothdude> There should be a really cool level at the Space Storm Galaxy I think
[2:23:57] <andrewofbob> Feeds Mario a bullet bill
[2:23:59] <%FuqBoiSlim> it was the section when you're on the ski cart or whatever that did it for me
[2:24:05] <%nimu290> do better "stabs you"
[2:24:12] <Prevot> MrDestructoid Pathethic.
[2:24:17] <%FuqBoiSlim> actually wait I think I got to the China level in the 360 version

[2:25:38] <SomersaultJustice> so when's the yoshi's island playthrough
[2:25:48] <%ChoculaUltra> there's a new yoshi game?!
[2:25:57] <Cynical_Canadian> Reggie clutching it out for Woolie
[2:26:12] <@Menitta> Yoshi's Island DS has issues of needing to switch babies constantly
[2:26:16] <Prevot> Yoshi's Wooly World was way better than the DS one IMO
[2:26:26] <@Menitta> Woolly World is great
[2:26:29] <SomersaultJustice> wooly world was better than both ds games
[2:26:47] <300coolfactsaboutbears> And tiny wario.
[2:27:01] <Prevot> the switch yoshi game was okay, but it didn't hit me like wooly world
[2:27:21] <Cynical_Canadian> This game loves the Oniel Cylinder, at least that's what I think these are supposed to be

[2:45:44] <nailwind> the cube is sacred, one wrong touch spells death
[2:46:03] <300coolfactsaboutbears> "Well I'm burning to death in the lava, might as well feed myself to the hippo."
[2:46:23] <@Menitta> Its a very specific fear
[2:46:40] <exnuart> Tarzan made hippos cute
[2:46:59] <+firmlygraspi1> they're one of the top man killers in nature
[2:47:06] <AnneSQF> it's their chubby faces
[2:47:12] <+LotS__> Hippos are not chill lol
[2:47:13] <ShiningAxis> hippos are living tanks
[2:47:18] <+CelebrityGhost> they don't have any sharp parts. They look like big water cows

[2:47:51] <+kewlmyc> That's a weird fetish, Woolie
[2:47:51] <300coolfactsaboutbears> It's a trash compressor.
[2:47:51] <heartlesshealer> they have a lot of power
[2:47:51] <%psidefx> Can't be unheard
[2:47:57] <Prevot> I gotta say, having played the 3D All Stars collection recently, those square poles are a massive improvement over 64 and Sunshine

[2:48:55] <%FroggoPrince> nevermind being that close to lava, that man would be bacon irl
[2:49:03] <300coolfactsaboutbears> Earthquakes are just the lava hippos unleashing their gaseous rage.
[2:49:13] <Mangahero18> Hippos are absolutely NOT chill. They are one of the most territorial creatures in nature. Super deadly. Though they still only kill like 500 people a year.

[2:52:04] <%jinking79> that Tarzan movie show how violent they r
[2:52:08] <300coolfactsaboutbears> Polar bear is the largest living land predator, but Hippo still probably wins.
