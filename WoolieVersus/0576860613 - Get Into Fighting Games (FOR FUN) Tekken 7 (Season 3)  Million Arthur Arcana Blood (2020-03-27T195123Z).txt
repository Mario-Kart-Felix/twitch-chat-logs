[0:12:48] <+TopTieramisu> @R_BChe american
[0:12:51] <+ggbhtg> BUT THE BLOCK IS GONE
[0:12:57] <kaine_west> lars is the complete opposite tbh
[0:12:58] <NeroIscariot12> Well they already have a Bruce Lee so it's fine LUL
[0:13:01] <SpirittiArt> eh... Sweden tho'
[0:13:02] <+ggbhtg> where da block go!?
[0:13:12] <DarknessD42> Like Shaheen, they brought in a middle eastern student to help them
[0:13:18] <Limebot> As traditional as it gets
[0:13:19] <JaceDarkstar> but how does that explain the bears
[0:13:20] <J33P3R5_CR33P3R> Is there a story behind this game’s Ezio then?
[0:13:27] <+TopTieramisu> is skateboarding popular in the middle east?
[0:13:28] <%ironohki> The bears are bear.
[0:13:31] <kaine_west> ezio is diavalo
[0:13:38] <HighDrated_TK> Claudio fights demons and ghosts
[0:13:38] <+halaa19> wouldn't want to offend bear culture
[0:13:41] <+TopTieramisu> because my mans has a yun skateboard grind
[0:13:45] <HighDrated_TK> That's all you need to know
[0:13:55] <%ironohki> I was telling my buddy about Tekken. He asked me "Is the bear's name just Bear?" Yes.
[0:14:01] <+yappari_> damn, you don't have the stage BGM

[0:14:30] <+halaa19> I wanna get struck by lightning
[0:14:35] <kaine_west> Lucky Chloe is loved in the Tekken community
[0:14:37] <%absolutenc> absolutenc subscribed with Twitch Prime.
[0:14:50] <+TopTieramisu> it's ok. i don't need two capos
[0:14:50] <+ggbhtg> you can't disprove they got super powers
[0:14:55] <J33P3R5_CR33P3R> Someone have a big steel rod I can use as a conductor?
[0:14:56] <Limebot> A bit overdeseigned tbh
[0:14:56] <+Sulfur_Boride> Toenails exploded? Damn...
[0:14:57] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> I wanna get struck by lightning too
[0:15:00] <SpirittiArt> man, I want Ps4 BGM to PC too
[0:15:01] <%absolutenc> PogChamp doodLeon woolieGASM
[0:15:02] <+rc_ie> Christie was a trash clone character, Chloe is great
[0:15:10] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Not for the tatoo, I just wanna die
[0:15:12] <HighDrated_TK> Well Christie served no purpose
[0:15:15] <+CozyCoat> yo woolie try b/f+4
[0:15:17] <kaine_west> this isn't thr fahkumram stage music
[0:15:22] <Prevot> can't believe Christie got fucked by lucky chloe
[0:15:23] <+TopTieramisu> it's ok. they put christie in kof 14 :)
[0:15:26] <+ggbhtg> plus by 1
[0:15:30] <MyNameIsRasus> They still did Eddie dirty
[0:15:31] <kaine_west> yeah chloe is a unique character with her own mechanics
[0:15:42] <@Squdnate> Christie was just a pallet swap anyway
[0:15:44] <+callmelyra_> fergHey fergHey fergHey fergHey
[0:15:47] <@Squdnate> Lucky Chloe forever
[0:15:47] <+ggbhtg> generic jab 1s are +1f
[0:15:55] <HighDrated_TK> @squdnate I'm saying
[0:15:58] <+IKilledADeadGuy> Frame data display may help learn!
[0:15:58] <+ggbhtg> Obligatory TAIGURRRRR
[0:16:11] <+ggbhtg> may it might
[0:16:22] <+ggbhtg> or be an info overload
[0:16:27] <%CaptainPileDriver> i think this character is waaaay cooler than sagat
[0:16:34] <DaKnightWarrior> He's more like Bruce then Sagat.
[0:16:35] <Monkeyweed21> Does he still have the high and low tiger shots?
[0:16:39] <bitterssweets> wait till you see this man's range
[0:16:41] <+TopTieramisu> the really weird new character was gigass. felt like a placeholder for marduk until marduk came back. and now he's a forgotten character
[0:16:44] <HighDrated_TK> F3+4 is the armor @woolieversus
[0:16:44] <+Sulfur_Boride> So Fahkumram's gameplay is him being literally as intimidating as he looks, b/c of his lightning moves.
[0:16:49] <+rc_ie> DF1+2 is another throw for him
[0:16:49] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> You cant beat Sagat man
[0:16:59] <arkv01> the virgin sagat, chad fahkuram
[0:17:04] <+IKilledADeadGuy> Some have more than one armor move actually
[0:17:05] <+Sulfur_Boride> Fahkumram's is absolutely TERRIFYING when he's got you up against the wall
[0:17:06] <+ggbhtg> kick counter only
[0:17:11] <+yappari_> nice cock
[0:17:15] <HighDrated_TK> ^
[0:17:15] <Solidnick18> oh
[0:17:23] <DaKnightWarrior> @yappari_ Aris sup?
[0:17:23] <+TopTieramisu> ^^
[0:17:28] <+Suneater_Jerome> ^^^
[0:17:36] <+callmelyra_> Fahkumrams wall game is hell if you are on the receiving end
[0:17:37] <DaKnightWarrior> *sub
[0:17:40] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> why is he a giant man
[0:17:41] <+CozyCoat> It's only kicks
[0:17:44] <+CozyCoat> kick parry
[0:17:45] <+ggbhtg> you only absorb armor ONLY during certain frames, it aint 0 startup
[0:17:51] <MyNameIsRasus> Only kicks
[0:17:53] <+yappari_> atpRtsd @DaKnightWarrior
[0:17:55] <+IKilledADeadGuy> Kicks only
[0:17:57] <+johnny_gogo> @WoolieVersus it high kicks
[0:17:57] <Doctadaking> Only kicks\
[0:18:04] <HighDrated_TK> D3+4 is his "punch parry" @woolieversus
[0:18:04] <%Wool> Wool subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months! Next week I begin my career as a streamer teacher on Twitch, where I touch base with my students and answer any questions they have while playing Animal Crossing. Wish me luck.
[0:18:08] <+ggbhtg> punch parry is d3+4
[0:18:12] <Monkeyweed21> oh its gief's shitty counter
[0:18:27] <+ggbhtg> he is now HAAAAMBLE
[0:18:28] <J33P3R5_CR33P3R> PogChamp1000 here’s to you giving some people the work with Fakkukuman and killing demons with sick air dashes. Love you guys! <3
[0:18:35] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> also is woolie going to be playing the storymode of this?
[0:18:36] <HighDrated_TK> You get a full combo
[0:18:39] <HighDrated_TK> It is
[0:18:47] <%CaptainPileDriver> hype traiinn
[0:18:49] <%CaptainPileDriver> yay
[0:18:54] <HighDrated_TK> Time it with the punch and he parries it into a full combo
[0:18:56] <+ggbhtg> down 3 plus 4, not down back
[0:18:58] <@Squdnate> It was CH
[0:18:59] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> also do y'all remember how tekken 4 had a third person campaign?
[0:19:10] <+ggbhtg> the flip
[0:19:10] <+rc_ie> turn off rage in the options
[0:19:14] <+Sulfur_Boride> From what I've been told of my Thai-speaking father, you pronounce Fahkumram saying "You're history" as "led-by-sah". Tho, it sound like he's saying "saw" at the end.
[0:19:21] <+TheHoodKnight> it's a tsubaki parry, will parry if timed rigght
[0:19:22] <+ggbhtg> punches only
[0:19:25] <Korgororo> so did tekken 6
[0:19:30] <%Irridium> I remember the tekken 3 beat-em-up campaign
[0:19:39] <SpirittiArt> chicken
[0:19:42] <+Painkirax3> It’s back 3+4 for his kick parry
[0:19:50] <+Sulfur_Boride> He's got a command grab that only gives the opponent 14 frames to tech out.
[0:19:51] <HighDrated_TK> They know
[0:19:51] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @TheHoodKnight how is that different to any other parry
[0:19:53] <datdemo> Apparently its the hardest therow to break
[0:19:53] <Rum_Ham1> that throw is hard to break and it wall splats
[0:19:57] <Monkeyweed21> punch and kick based counters are way worse than high and low based counters
[0:19:58] <bitterssweets> just look at his movelist
[0:20:01] <+ggbhtg> his command grab has smaller tech frames, FOR SOME REASON
[0:20:19] <%CaptainPileDriver> i cannot wait to see high level fahkuram play
[0:20:25] <arkv01> I guess his waistline is based off of existing muay thai kickboxers?
[0:20:27] <HighDrated_TK> @eattheb0otylikegroceries Asuka can parry for 3 years and doesn't have to time it
[0:20:35] <+TheHoodKnight> @EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries it also is a normal hitting move even if it doesnt parry anythingg
[0:20:36] <+Sulfur_Boride> The command grab wall-splats, which means that the wall is absolutely going to be his opponent's doom
[0:20:58] <+Sulfur_Boride> It's to apply vice-grip pressure on the opponent with the grab and his charge moves
[0:21:08] <+yappari_> unleash the 🎷 BGM
[0:21:09] <+ggbhtg> to know what's a natural combo: option 1 = Stand, option 2 = guard all @woolieversus
[0:21:09] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:21:16] <bitterssweets> that's not even the stages theme
[0:21:36] <kaine_west> yeah this is the Tekken 5 or tekken 6music?
[0:21:36] <HighDrated_TK> ^
[0:21:38] <+ggbhtg> they got jukebox turned on, yes
[0:21:43] <HighDrated_TK> T6
[0:21:59] <Doctadaking> How did they use jukebox on a stage they just downloaded?
[0:22:02] <+ggbhtg> dash ups are never notated
[0:22:07] <+ggbhtg> never ever
[0:22:22] <HighDrated_TK> @doctadaking Jukebox can just randomize all music
[0:22:31] <%Irridium> though you can press the touchpad+square to see what it should look like
[0:22:35] <+TheHoodKnight> you do higher damage in rage (the red glow effect)
[0:22:35] <redrins> might wanna turn rage off
[0:22:35] <crimsonsaens> Doesn't Unist now tell when there's a dash?
[0:22:39] <Doctadaking> Oh okay
[0:22:53] <bitterssweets> turn off rage too. the damage is misleading
[0:22:57] <%ironohki> VoHiYo1005
[0:23:05] <+ggbhtg> jukebox puts a previous games whole ost on different stages
[0:23:17] <+ggbhtg> or you can customize each stage
[0:23:26] <peachy996> Oh sweet Tag 2 music
[0:23:28] <+vaporousTippler> Oh fuck it's Tekken.
[0:23:38] <Doctadaking> Yeah I always manually assign a track to each stage
[0:23:39] <kaine_west> that means do it fast [ this input ]
[0:23:40] <DeebzNutz100> jukebox is S-tier
[0:23:50] <+ggbhtg> buttons in brackets are for very quick or slide inputs
[0:23:53] <jubejube56> Oh I hope they just run into a wave of Leroy’s online
[0:24:00] <HighDrated_TK> So S-tier they modded it on pc
[0:24:07] <+TheHoodKnight> you kinda need to piano them
[0:24:26] <+ggbhtg> jukebox mod is busted on pc
[0:24:30] <bitterssweets> leroy got nerfed. everyone's using mishimas now
[0:24:38] <+ggbhtg> unless the new project gained ground
[0:24:45] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Oh so its Tekken now
[0:24:47] <peachy996> Never seen this character play but these look like Bruce Irvin combos
[0:24:58] <+dmtjinni> Woolz
[0:24:58] <spiegspikel> Man his piano slide inputs are a bitch.
[0:24:58] <jubejube56> I know that he got nerfed, but I still find Leroy spam much funnier than Mishima spam
[0:24:59] <@Squdnate> Oh yeah, the Mishimas got BEEF
[0:25:07] <+ggbhtg> @woolieversus you can slide input it
[0:25:09] <@Squdnate> Hope you like ELECTRICS
[0:25:17] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> DORYA
[0:25:22] <+TheHoodKnight> MASKU
[0:25:25] <%tearfuldevil> last time i was palying everyone was spamming mishimas
[0:25:25] <+R_BChe> just block mishima hellsweep 4Head
[0:25:28] <HighDrated_TK> Tekken 5 electrics are kinda back and it's scary
[0:25:33] <%tearfuldevil> so i guess its back to normal
[0:25:37] <%tearfuldevil> oof okay
[0:25:45] <%tearfuldevil> t5 elecs sound bad
[0:25:48] <+IKilledADeadGuy> You basically cancel the startup with the second button. It’s called a tilda or ~ in notation
[0:26:00] <+rc_ie> What's up stoners atpTopSpeed atpTopSpeed atpTopSpeed
[0:26:08] <jubejube56> They also made the hellsweep hitbox better or something
[0:26:18] <HighDrated_TK> It tracks better
[0:26:20] <%tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus you might want to turn off rage woolie
[0:26:27] <jubejube56> Yeah that was it
[0:26:45] <HighDrated_TK> Not crazy better but still something to look out for
[0:26:57] <%tearfuldevil> its making your damage a bit misleading
[0:26:59] <%ironohki> Go low on that second set.
[0:27:09] <%tearfuldevil> and also its killing my adhd brain
[0:27:14] <peachy996> Question: does he have b12 as a stun that you can combo off of?
[0:27:19] <HighDrated_TK> @woolieversus The rage my man you gotta turn that off
[0:27:22] <+purplehermit12> wait is this guy muay thai?
[0:27:33] <%tearfuldevil> yeah
[0:27:35] <%ironohki> Freezy: yeah
[0:27:36] <+TopTieramisu> this guy is the most muay thai
[0:27:40] <Solidnick18> yep
[0:27:43] <%tearfuldevil> look at the shorts and the wrappings
[0:27:45] <arkv01> muay thai incarnate
[0:27:52] <%tearfuldevil> so incredibly muay thai
[0:27:52] <+IKilledADeadGuy> The regular damage is listed in the trial notation guys it’s not a big deal
[0:27:57] <+rc_ie> The Shmix
[0:27:59] <peachy996> Does he have an attack with b12?
[0:28:15] <%tearfuldevil> i don't care about the damage tha tmuch, its just killing me with the glows
[0:28:15] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:28:19] <SpirittiArt> 50/50
[0:28:26] <jubejube56> As we all know, you are 100% Muay Thai if you get dropped into the arena from a helicopter
[0:28:30] <%ironohki> My girlfriend tried out Josie, and had to rage quit on her because she couldn't stand how Josie cries after every match, win or lose.
[0:28:30] <+Pookiedaexzile> HIG EM WIT DAT SAENCHAI SHIT
[0:28:32] <+TopTieramisu> bruce died to give us a swag black man and a not-black muay thai man
[0:28:49] <%ironohki> Girlfriend mains Asuka now.
[0:28:59] <Dao_Puppy> You know it's muay thai man because he's shaped like a lawn rake.
[0:29:04] <%zenkiro_> His movelist has a lot of those brackets
[0:29:08] <HighDrated_TK> @peachy996 He has no b1+2
[0:29:12] <peachy996> Okay
[0:29:13] <%tearfuldevil> @ironohki oh jeez i forgot about that.....does tekken have any not iffy ladie characters?
[0:29:13] <%ironohki> You know it's muay thai cuz of the knees and elbows.
[0:29:13] <+dmtjinni> brb
[0:29:19] <+ggbhtg> something something mixups, something block hellsweep even though it's a true mixup, something
[0:29:24] <%tearfuldevil> oh yeah, oscar. oscars good i guess
[0:29:25] <peachy996> So he doesn't have Bruce's biggest tool
[0:29:26] <+vaporousTippler> I don't think I can take a fight between this guy and Josie seriously. Ever.
[0:29:29] <kaine_west> thats most Tekken characters with a stance transitiojn
[0:29:48] <peachy996> Bruce b12 in Tag 2 was the best tool
[0:29:53] <+ggbhtg> Asuka is a big ol turtle. She's Mr President
[0:29:56] <HighDrated_TK> Ok
[0:30:00] <+Pookiedaexzile> When the low kickwallsplats, yhou know you got a muaythai guy
[0:30:04] <%ironohki> @tearknack GF mains Asuka, I main Julia. Asuka is a cool character, and I wish Julia never opened her mouth.
[0:30:10] <%tearfuldevil> @vaporousTippler i mean, lucky chloe versus literally anyone
[0:30:13] <+TopTieramisu> asuka has street fighter hands
[0:30:13] <%shradke> classic
[0:30:23] <+ChrisPlaysThing> I main Hwaorang
[0:30:28] <+vaporousTippler> Yeah, not even wrong.
[0:30:29] <%ironohki> @TopTieramisu I love that.
[0:30:31] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Armor King gang
[0:30:33] <peachy996> I main Yoshimitsu
[0:30:34] <+ChrisPlaysThing> let the salt flow
[0:30:40] <+ggbhtg> it's called being enlighted. Simmons had a ROUGH time, not being used to the flow of Tekken's combat
[0:30:45] <HighDrated_TK> @l_a_s_e_r_m_a_n I'm with you
[0:30:48] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Also I hate Hwoarang
[0:30:48] <redrins> @peachy996 the only right choice
[0:30:50] <peachy996> King and AK I'd love to have secondaries but it's been too long
[0:30:55] <+rc_ie> It's 3 [4~3] to wallsplat on block
[0:30:55] <Solidnick18> King players FeelsGoodMan
[0:31:03] <bitterssweets> negan gang
[0:31:07] <%tearfuldevil> @ironohki i played Kasumi a bit and she was cool
[0:31:08] <+ggbhtg> @woolieversus change restart position to wall, in options
[0:31:10] <%ironohki> @tearknack I actually custom costumed Chloe into a swearter and jeans with no bullshit cat whatever. I actually like the character after that.
[0:31:14] <primaryfire> most good players will adjust their combo to account for the wall as well
[0:31:24] <+Pookiedaexzile> Lowkick will splat onwall
[0:31:32] <+ggbhtg> hold the 2nd forward
[0:31:36] <+ggbhtg> hold dat
[0:31:49] <%tearfuldevil> @ironohki oh yeah i recall i spent hour basically giving all character KoF style snazzy costumes
[0:31:51] <+ggbhtg> you can DEEP DISH dash
[0:32:07] <%ironohki> Without the weeb shit, Chloe is actually an interesting style based on turning pop dancing into attacks. I unironically love her choreography. Even her voice is fine, she's just saying "one two" like she's counting dance steps.
[0:32:08] <+ggbhtg> Digiorno dash ins
[0:32:13] <datdemo> 3
[0:32:14] <Zayasu> @WoolieVersus can you deactivate jukebox for the original stage bgm?
[0:32:17] <primaryfire> he has 3 rage drives
[0:32:22] <jubejube56> Get that digiorno outta here
[0:32:24] <+ggbhtg> 3 ways to use the same RD
[0:32:27] <jubejube56> Delissio all the way
[0:32:36] <HighDrated_TK> No 2 ways to do the same rd
[0:32:38] <bitterssweets> 2
[0:32:51] <+ChrisPlaysThing> Give Hwaorang a go if you've a mind to.
[0:32:54] <+ggbhtg> you can do it out of rising 2 foos
[0:33:03] <+ggbhtg> become enlighteeeeed
[0:33:08] <KaiserMario> oh man, I didn't know Woolie was playing Fakkuman today!
[0:33:19] <+ggbhtg> yes, enlighted LUL
[0:33:24] <%tearfuldevil> i mean, i'm sure well see some steve fox
[0:33:27] <%ironohki> Tear: I'm an old man now. One arguably-sucky thing about getting older is that "hot girl" shit in video games gets progressively more cringy with distance from puberty.
[0:33:36] <+mecharocky> What do the brackets mean? I don't know much about Tekken
[0:33:42] <%CaptainPileDriver> yo, anybody wanna run some warm-up sets with me?
[0:33:44] <$StaceMcGate> oh hey, the new Baki character rleased
[0:33:48] <+Aeriqui> it means you slide the buttons
[0:33:55] <primaryfire> charged 4 in the stance will cause a huge stagger on block that can wall splat
[0:33:56] <%tearfuldevil> @ironohki i'm a lesbian so.....mixed feelings lol
[0:33:57] <+Aeriqui> also reads as 4~4
[0:33:59] <+ggbhtg> @captainpiledriver where you live?
[0:34:01] <HighDrated_TK> Or press it quick af
[0:34:01] <+yappari_> @mecharocky you have to press them quickly
[0:34:03] <elicazzz> @ironohki for me is getting the other way around lol
[0:34:10] <Zayasu> the animations are great, but the character... LUL
[0:34:10] <%CaptainPileDriver> i'm in MInnesota
[0:34:12] <peachy996> Being gay means the hot guys never stop being cringy
[0:34:13] <+Pookiedaexzile> The Muay Mixups
[0:34:25] <+mecharocky> thnx @Aeriqui
[0:34:30] <+Aeriqui> i only know bc raven has slide inputs
[0:34:31] <+rc_ie> he's a Baki tribute
[0:34:46] <peachy996> Dude this BGM has got me wanting to play Tag 2 again
[0:34:49] <+Aeriqui> they're tricky but you can't piano
[0:34:56] <+ggbhtg> @captainpiledriver that'll work, but I need to lab and or eat something
[0:35:05] <KaiserMario> Did Woolie check that kick that wall bounces on block?
[0:35:06] <%CaptainPileDriver> lol, go ahead
[0:35:06] <+ggbhtg> sorry for the goose cheese
[0:35:10] <+ggbhtg> chase
[0:35:18] <J33P3R5_CR33P3R> Hit by the DOOA
[0:35:18] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1242929035937820672?s=20
[0:35:25] <+Pookiedaexzile> Typa dude Baki would beat by armbar and be friends with untill his dad killed him
[0:35:28] <%RyTYoung> Can we see some Neegan gameplay I've never seen him in this before LUL
[0:35:32] <%CaptainPileDriver> anybody wanna come play in a player set to warm up i'm open, psn name is CaptainSagit
[0:35:53] <%tearfuldevil> that feel when on pc BibleThump
[0:35:57] <peachy996> Lemme set stuff up
[0:35:59] <+mecharocky> Yeah, I always tended to stay away from characters with those inputs, I stuck to king or Law
[0:36:02] <derpykook> Without the animal shit, Kuma is actually an interesting style based on turning brute strength into attacks. I unironically love his fighting style. Even his voice is fine, he's just growling like he's going in for the kill.
[0:36:03] <%RyTYoung> @captainpiledriver I would but my game never dl'd fast enough BibleThump
[0:36:09] <+ggbhtg> damage value is new, stars arent @woolieversus
[0:36:11] <%CaptainPileDriver> lol
[0:36:12] <kaine_west> tfw own PS4 tekken but is in Australia
[0:36:15] <datdemo> Try out his back 2, 1 (hold)
[0:36:18] <kaine_west> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[0:36:18] <HighDrated_TK> @kaisermario Wall bounces or wall splats cause I wanna know what his wall bounce kick is
[0:36:23] <%tearfuldevil> the bears are great
[0:36:26] <%CaptainPileDriver> @rytyoung you just get the game today or update?
[0:36:27] <+theneosloth> if you like kumas non animal attacks just play heihachi
[0:36:30] <peachy996> I haven't seriously played Tekken since MK11 and SC6 came out
[0:36:32] <+ggbhtg> he got a Nash kick
[0:36:39] <primaryfire> b,f+4 plays the sound of a lightning strike it's so sick
[0:36:46] <DarknessD42> A wall carry
[0:36:53] <%RyTYoung> @captainpiledriver had to delete for space a while back
[0:37:00] <%CaptainPileDriver> fair
[0:37:02] <+Pookiedaexzile> Have they seen the Teep Kick?
[0:37:13] <+ggbhtg> technically called While Standing
[0:37:16] <T_Sasquatch> I literally unistalled tekken because i didn't have the time commitment for it.... Then corona happened
[0:37:21] <Solidnick18> PogChamp
[0:37:27] <+Shotgundam009> lol
[0:37:36] <Solidnick18> that's nuts
[0:37:41] <%CaptainPileDriver> wooow
[0:37:42] <SpirittiArt> look at that.
[0:37:50] <+ggbhtg> @woolieversus Reg Imma tweet you the geese wall combo for woolie LUL
[0:37:51] <%itsnotsadik> itsnotsadik subscribed with Twitch Prime.
[0:37:54] <%tearfuldevil> how different are there actual results?
[0:37:57] <DaKnightWarrior> His rage drives are really good.
[0:38:11] <primaryfire> it's not as much a cancel as it is a stance transition
[0:38:14] <$StaceMcGate> never played Tekken and don't play fighting games, these inputs look like hieroglyphics to me
[0:38:14] <%TheOneCalledRock> getting all breaks on geese's stage is a feeling like no other
[0:38:22] <$SilverRoddo> I thought i heard Bakugan.
[0:38:22] <%TheOneCalledRock> Wall*
[0:38:29] <%itsnotsadik> Tekken's crazy technical
[0:38:34] <primaryfire> @WoolieVersus charged 4 in stance wall splats on block
[0:38:37] <datdemo> do his back 2, 1 (charge)
[0:38:43] <+Deko_> holy
[0:38:46] <%tearfuldevil> hes learning
[0:38:47] <%itsnotsadik> I come from playing MK with some FighterZ and my god I just can't adapt
[0:38:57] <KaiserMario> @thehighdrated1 it's a side kick with an unique glowing animation, it causes the enemy to wall bounce on block, might be a splat though, I only took a quick look at it
[0:38:57] <+Painkirax3> Yup and if you block that next to a wall you get wall splatted
[0:38:58] <T_Sasquatch> Push black LUL
[0:39:01] <%tearfuldevil> i started fg 3 years ago
[0:39:01] <DDoSd_By_Door> unblockable at the wall @WoolieVersus
[0:39:02] <+ggbhtg> you can keep 3 held, press 4, and it'll be a 3+4
[0:39:05] <%tearfuldevil> and is tarted with tekken
[0:39:06] <+Aeriqui> its steppable though
[0:39:12] <peachy996> Really? I always feel like its easier to adapt from 2d and 3d
[0:39:12] <+Aeriqui> they're very linear
[0:39:15] <%tearfuldevil> i find adapting to other fighting games hard
[0:39:17] <%tearfuldevil> like
[0:39:20] <%tearfuldevil> jumping
[0:39:21] <big_oki> basically tiger shot
[0:39:23] <+ggbhtg> charged moves wallsplat ON BLOCK @woolieversus
[0:39:26] <%tearfuldevil> why would i ever jump
[0:39:29] <peachy996> It's going back to MKX from playing so much MK11 that messes me up
[0:39:29] <%CaptainPileDriver> did someone in chat join my lobby
[0:39:38] <%CaptainPileDriver> cause i just got fahkuramed
[0:39:53] <+Pookiedaexzile> mid teep kick keeps people a mile away
[0:40:03] <%tearfuldevil> i mena there's akuma and eliza but i don't play either of them
[0:40:07] <primaryfire> guaranteed after lots of moves like b+1
[0:40:09] <SheefEatsBeef> YO
[0:40:11] <Solidnick18> PogChamp
[0:40:19] <+ggbhtg> TAIGAAA RAID
[0:40:19] <%ironohki> That's some rad shit.
[0:40:20] <+mecharocky> HOLY SHIT
[0:40:22] <peachy996> Oh hey Bruce's old move
[0:40:25] <DaKnightWarrior> So sick
[0:40:37] <Solidnick18> this characters rad
[0:40:40] <DaKnightWarrior> plus the Floor Break to extend combos
[0:40:41] <SuperCreeperBlocks> Is he just Bruce
[0:40:47] <primaryfire> try doing it after the screw
[0:40:48] <peachy996> You should look at Bruce combos in tag 2, he always kneed people into orbit
[0:40:56] <Doctadaking> That would be an ender
[0:40:59] <+IKilledADeadGuy> @tearknack Jumping gives you different moves. In this game every “state” you character is in, ie: standing, crouching, jumping, can practically be considered stances that give you access to different moves you can’t normally just do
[0:41:00] <+TopTieramisu> bruce is dead. his moves have been absorbed by tekken and giftd to others
[0:41:01] <+ggbhtg> gravity keeps us on the grouuuund
[0:41:04] <+ggbhtg> btw
[0:41:24] <HighDrated_TK> Fahk absorbed Bruce so those moves are HIS now
[0:41:32] <+ggbhtg> yep
[0:41:33] <+yappari_> it's just +1 on block
[0:41:35] <peachy996> It's not the same as Bruce
[0:41:37] <+ggbhtg> big yeps
[0:41:39] <357Sneak> Oh, Fakhu is Out?
[0:41:46] <+ggbhtg> they ALL DO
[0:41:47] <DDoSd_By_Door> kicks too
[0:41:49] <kaine_west> Byran, Josie amd Fahkmuram all inherited bruce
[0:41:50] <+Aeriqui> combo is HEAVILY scaled
[0:41:53] <+TopTieramisu> yep, he's a danger at the wall
[0:41:54] <redrins> dis gus ting
[0:41:58] <jubejube56> Eventually all characters return to the Tekken magma lifestream
[0:42:01] <peachy996> You can make all the Muay Thai character you want but Bruce is still the best Tekken muay thai guy
[0:42:02] <+SuperKirby24> NO COWARDICE LUL
[0:42:03] <HighDrated_TK> Nah Bryan came before Bruce what
[0:42:14] <SuperCreeperBlocks> Look at this Baki ass character
[0:42:15] <kaine_west> nah bruce was in T2
[0:42:18] <+ggbhtg> Bruce is T2
[0:42:22] <kaine_west> bryan was a replacement
[0:42:23] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:42:23] <Doctadaking> Bryan was T3
[0:42:24] <+ggbhtg> bryan is T3
[0:42:26] <kaine_west> in T3
[0:42:26] <HighDrated_TK> Oh you're right my mistake
[0:42:29] <KaiserMario> The wall splat doesn't do damage though, from what i could tell
[0:42:31] <primaryfire> it's disgusting
[0:42:35] <$Kekon3> block and launch tho LUL
[0:42:37] <+ggbhtg> splatoon boys
[0:42:42] <%tearfuldevil> @IKilledADeadGuy i know that shit, but i've never relaly felt any need to jump, or seen anyone (who didn't play one of the guests) that jumped much
[0:42:46] <+ggbhtg> OFF THE HOOK
[0:42:54] <bitterssweets> just jab them out of it
[0:42:54] <+Deko_> LUL
[0:42:55] <redrins> that MIGHT be a stage counterpick fr
[0:42:58] <+Aeriqui> it scales the combo heavily though and is steppable in both directions
[0:42:58] <primaryfire> splats do 1 damage @KaiserMario it's hilarious when it kills
[0:42:59] <+TopTieramisu> once upon a time, bryan was almost identical to bruce
[0:43:11] <%tearfuldevil> well, high level players do shit that mystifies but no one at my locals was that good
[0:43:11] <+ggbhtg> it was not
[0:43:13] <KaiserMario> LUL
[0:43:17] <peachy996> I like the Tag track more
[0:43:21] <kaine_west> yeah Bryan was a Bruce replacement
[0:43:23] <+Shotgundam009> Would that break wall if you block it?
[0:43:28] <peachy996> Tag 2 music is great
[0:43:29] <kaine_west> and then Josie and Now fahkmuram
[0:43:30] <%ironohki> @peachy996 But don't you want to cry at the end of every match, win or lose?
[0:43:32] <HighDrated_TK> No
[0:43:32] <Doctadaking> I always put the Snow Castle track on Infinite Azure 1
[0:43:36] <+ggbhtg> you can change each song
[0:43:40] <+ggbhtg> one by one
[0:43:45] <%tearfuldevil> that was tag music
[0:43:53] <jubejube56> But infinite azure is best song in the game tho
[0:43:54] <peachy996> No I want to hear Tekken music I like
[0:43:59] <+NYCrownlessKing> you can change individual music
[0:44:05] <peachy996> Tag 2 > T7
[0:44:08] <kaine_west> tekken 7 preset
[0:44:09] <+ggbhtg> b 1+4 iirc
[0:44:12] <+TopTieramisu> it'd be cool if they switched the other archetypes as often as they did for muay thai
[0:44:15] <peachy996> Soundtrack wise but that's just my preference
[0:44:15] <$StaceMcGate> Eh
[0:44:18] <+TopTieramisu> the same damn mishimas since forever
[0:44:23] <DeebzNutz100> noblest song is Heat Haze Shadow
[0:44:32] <SpirittiArt> what
[0:44:32] <%ironohki> I'm all into the Tekken 3 music, just cuz that's where I started. Big nostalgia.
[0:44:35] <HighDrated_TK> Can't really change Mishimas tbh
[0:44:36] <%tearfuldevil> is this song new?
[0:44:44] <primaryfire> t5dr had the best soundtrack imo
[0:44:44] <joshsleeze> Tekken 5 has the BEST music of all of them
[0:44:46] <%tearfuldevil> i don't remember it having lyrics
[0:44:47] <%ironohki> 10 string is near useless though.
[0:44:50] <nevan_44> fuck em raw
[0:44:51] <+TopTieramisu> you can if you kept them dead
[0:44:52] <+HurtboxTV> T7 music is bottom tier
[0:44:52] <+mecharocky> yo his costumes are so sick
[0:44:52] <redrins> this sounds new
[0:44:53] <ElPlasa> @DeebzNutz100 MY MAN
[0:44:54] <Kenny_Riot> All the Tekkens have bangers...
[0:44:56] <djazo> t3 and t5 music tho
[0:45:01] <@Squdnate> The Main Menu and Selection has changed every Season
[0:45:03] <+Pookiedaexzile> WHAT LOOKS AMERICAN ABOUT THAT
[0:45:04] <peachy996> Yes.
[0:45:04] <rsg220> TEKKEN 5 OST IS SICK
[0:45:08] <+SuperKirby24> yeah I'm a sucker for 5 music
[0:45:08] <DaKnightWarrior> Tekken 1 ans 2 music aswell.
[0:45:08] <+TopTieramisu> t7 definitely is a step down OST-wise
[0:45:09] <Doctadaking> Tekken 3 and 5 are my favorite
[0:45:09] <jubejube56> I mean if they changed Jin and Siegfried, they can probably change Mishima
[0:45:09] <+yappari_> 🎷 SourPls 🎷
[0:45:09] <@Squdnate> So there is Season 1, Season 2 and Season 3
[0:45:11] <%tearfuldevil> tekken 7 is the only one i've played tha tmuch of, and there's some bangers
[0:45:13] <%emeraldskrull> woolieDATTEBAYO woolieDATTEBAYO woolieDATTEBAYO
[0:45:15] <Vortigon> IT'S NOT A TUNA is the best tekken song
[0:45:16] <$Kekon3> RUN IT HOMIE
[0:45:17] <+HurtboxTV> Tekken 2 is still the best Tekken OST imo
[0:45:20] <joshsleeze> ITS NOT TUNA!!!
[0:45:25] <spiegspikel> What part of that outfit looks American?
[0:45:25] <$Kekon3> I KNOCK EM DOWN
[0:45:26] <peachy996> T1-Tag2 is the best, so many great tracks throughout the years
[0:45:27] <Solidnick18> SourPls
[0:45:31] <Kenny_Riot> Tekken is 25 years of bangers. Even the Tekken mobile game had bangers
[0:45:31] <mr_sups> This is the correct music
[0:45:32] <+theneosloth> t7 has at least two great songs and they're both on gcorp helipad
[0:45:34] <Zayasu> LUL
[0:45:35] <+ggbhtg> I cant have this ost fight right now
[0:45:35] <DeebzNutz100> @333agus333 doodBro

[0:46:21] <@Squdnate> THIS SONG IS DOPE
[0:46:26] <Doctadaking> Yeah I switched this music immediately to something else
[0:46:27] <%tearfuldevil> i like the traditional sounding bits
[0:46:28] <+ggbhtg> I think it's b1+4
[0:46:29] <@Squdnate> It's full SourPls
[0:46:38] <kaine_west> SourPls
[0:46:43] <+Pookiedaexzile> When the thai flutes start playing you know they finna start throwing hard ass leg kicks
[0:46:45] <+TopTieramisu> murray tweeting about blocking hellsweeps while this is in the BG
[0:46:55] <+Shotgundam009> SourPls
[0:47:05] <peachy996> Oh what you have to buy Fahkumraam to get the stage? I thought it was free
[0:47:09] <peachy996> That sucks
[0:47:09] <+ggbhtg> I saw someone use it as a WALL ENDER THO
[0:47:10] <ElPlasa> also, DISTORTER GANG RISE UP
[0:47:20] <Kenny_Riot> DISTORTER!!!
[0:47:20] <+ggbhtg> you could buy stage separate
[0:47:23] <FromGoon2Goon> tag 1&2 soundtracks always better. it you have revolution outside looking in
[0:47:26] <VodkaVermin> Honestly this song only fits if sick stuff is happening otherwise it's pretty weird
[0:47:34] <peachy996> Okay I'll look in store
[0:47:39] <+CrystalLakeWasJusASetback> @WoolieVersus When's the last time ya'll played WEAPONLORD?
[0:47:40] <primaryfire> festering fear consumes the mind
[0:47:47] <+jiggy_snipe> the tag track is much better
[0:47:57] <fluke_LKZ> You gotta be a psychic to sidestep that RD
[0:47:59] <SpirittiArt> T6 Anger of the earth- best song, change my mind
[0:48:06] <Zayasu> 🎷 Jebaited 🎷 Jebaited 🎷 Jebaited 🎷 Jebaited
[0:48:06] <%tearfuldevil> jukebox being ps4 only is dumb
[0:48:09] <bitterssweets> fahkumram can make a sick m bison cosplay on the right
[0:48:10] <%tearfuldevil> i don't get it
[0:48:11] <@Squdnate> TTT1 OST > TTT2 OST
[0:48:14] <@Squdnate> Dont @ me
[0:48:17] <Mantisman01> Nice!
[0:48:19] <Kenny_Riot> Death Fight on the Neon
[0:48:22] <redrins> yo the track really goes in at point round
[0:48:28] <DaKnightWarrior> @squdnate you're right though.
[0:48:28] <+HurtboxTV> Fahk is pretty ok tbh
[0:48:43] <+Pookiedaexzile> Spin it kiss it
[0:48:45] <+TopTieramisu> as long as he's not day 1 leroy, he's fine
[0:49:01] <$StaceMcGate> There isn't enough screen for the both of them
[0:49:02] <+Sulfur_Boride> I'm assuming that's his intro for just his stage, since he's praying there?
[0:49:03] <%tearfuldevil> i didn't play tekken at all while leroy was the shit
[0:49:04] <kaine_west> yeah he's not high-tier
[0:49:06] <Kenny_Riot> To be honest though, Tekken music doesn't need to be debated. there's 25 years of bangers and there's something for EVERYONE
[0:49:09] <%tearfuldevil> jsut happened to miss it
[0:49:13] <DeebzNutz100> Another good Tekken song is "Hall of Fate" Tekken 5 DR credits theme
[0:49:15] <peachy996> Tag 1 OST is a classic I won't deny that
[0:49:22] <Huntercd> New fighter that uses Muay Thai?
[0:49:25] <MyNameIsRasus> YP
[0:49:26] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:49:31] <MyNameIsRasus> yo*
[0:49:31] <Kenny_Riot> Tag 1 console OST or Arcade OST? They're not the same
[0:49:32] <HighDrated_TK> The charged guard crushes don't track
[0:49:35] <%tearfuldevil> as someone who doesn't care for wubbs i don't like much of the t7 ost
[0:49:36] <%TheOneCalledRock> tekken looks so much fun to play but boy i suck BALLS at it
[0:49:45] <%tearfuldevil> super jelly that you can change tracks on ps4
[0:49:50] <peachy996> @Kenny_Riot I mostly prefer Console but Arcade has some versions
[0:50:01] <@Squdnate> I personally prefer console OSTs to Arcade, because I grew up with playing on consoles
[0:50:04] <skiersteve> are these guys better than low tier god?
[0:50:07] <rsg220> is standinf 4 the teep kick?
[0:50:08] <Samburgerr> pretty sure you can mod pc music
[0:50:09] <jubejube56> Nice little balrog headbutt
[0:50:12] <peachy996> Yoshimitsu and Ogre's Arcade Tag 1 tracks sound great
[0:50:16] <HighDrated_TK> No
[0:50:26] <+Sulfur_Boride> @Samburgerr Sadly, the mod for that broke on PC when Noctis came out
[0:50:34] <%tearfuldevil> @skiersteve well, they don't be in bottles, so they're objectively inferior Kappa
[0:50:38] <+tearfuldevil> pee in
[0:50:39] <Kenny_Riot> The only Tekken OST to not come home EVER is arcade Tekken 4
[0:50:46] <+Rivalsz> whats his poke tools tho
[0:50:46] <SpirittiArt> They are using pads? not fighting sticks? lil majin style I see
[0:50:48] <peachy996> Ha that kinda looks like Bruce's b12
[0:50:56] <+LandOfTheWay> oh shit, fahkumram came out
[0:51:17] <%tearfuldevil> bi-cycle
[0:51:19] <+Rivalsz> was that bound?
[0:51:19] <skiersteve> whats the difference between being black and new age black, low tier god didnt answer me
[0:51:21] <SpirittiArt> Look at that. Taking it like a champ
[0:51:26] <%CaptainPileDriver> anybody else wanna join my warm-up lobby
[0:51:26] <+tuchpi> >lilmajin is the only pad user jermaDisgust
[0:51:29] <bitterssweets> hold a button to get a different win animation

[0:51:42] <Solidnick18> LUL
[0:51:48] <%tearfuldevil> @skiersteve i'd assume that you believe in new age mumbo jumbo?

[0:51:56] <Solidnick18> the little dance is great
[0:52:06] <%tearfuldevil> bicycle
[0:52:08] <+ggbhtg> To be fair, you definitely got KICKED IN YO CHEST
[0:52:11] <skiersteve> I dont know what it is, dafuq does new age black mean
[0:52:23] <+Pookiedaexzile> At least he's not shooting arrows at you likea ral Muay thai match
[0:52:25] <%CaptainPileDriver> i've got 2 characters for tonight
[0:52:28] <+ggbhtg> Aris subs declare it to be "Niiice cock"
[0:52:40] <+Rivalsz> that hook can be combo'd
[0:52:42] <ElPlasa> @ggbhtg hey alright
[0:52:44] <%CaptainPileDriver> a bob and a zafina
[0:52:44] <rsg220> aris subs being aris subs
[0:52:48] <+SuperKirby24> I love how tag 1 has so much post-round time that you can land an extra hit in seconds after they're ko'ed Kreygasm
[0:52:49] <KaiserMario> Am I crazy to think this guy was supposed to be Sagat in Tekken X SF, but since that is never coming out, they just created a new character instead?
[0:52:50] <+ggbhtg> but those are Aris subs, no one likes them, even Aris
[0:52:57] <J33P3R5_CR33P3R> He says “How many more?” in one of the other victory animations too. He doesn’t wanna do it but he tries to make it clean.
[0:52:58] <DeebzNutz100> atpMurray
[0:53:10] <kaine_west> @kaisermario he doesn't play anything like sagat
[0:53:15] <KnivesEve> this is for fun or glory?

[0:53:29] <$StaceMcGate> the hell is aris subs?
[0:53:30] <%ironohki> For Glory has experts invited, as opposed to regular crew.
[0:53:31] <rsg220> he has some sort of stance charge right?
[0:53:41] <primaryfire> it's possible but the t7 producer practices muay thai so he may be biased @KaiserMario
[0:53:45] <+Pookiedaexzile> Ong-baki
[0:53:47] <KnivesEve> ah okay then?
[0:53:49] <%CaptainPileDriver> @StaceMcGate i have no idea

[0:54:02] <%tearfuldevil> @StaceMcGate aris is a big figure in the tekken community, and apperently he has a super memey community
[0:54:05] <KaiserMario> @kaine_west because he's a new character, I didn't say they play the same

[0:57:19] <+TopTieramisu> i don't know what the devs were smoking when they designed leroy
[0:57:21] <%tearfuldevil> super rad
[0:57:23] <alephalpha> makes sense considering the way I hear tekken works
[0:57:24] <%ironohki> Man I really wish I could run into Woolie+Leroy in the wild and go a couple rounds.
[0:57:24] <+TopTieramisu> they gave him the best everything

[0:58:03] <mr_sups> Shoes are 100% 'UN-SCUFFABLE'
[0:58:09] <zamzoph> Is that purposefully a radiating God suit, or is the lighting engine just fucky like t hat?
[0:58:11] <ElPlasa> @alephalpha he basically has everyone's tools, he has an orbital, hellsweep, nice pokes, parries, two rage drives with the cane, very easy to execute, and now not so much cuz they nerfed him a bit, but he had absolutley busted crazy damage
[0:58:11] <%tearfuldevil> get this work
[0:58:16] <rsg220> Got his name on a sandwich at the local shop
[0:58:18] <+jiggy_snipe> lol
[0:58:24] <J33P3R5_CR33P3R> Pack up all that stuff young busta, you in my damn chair
[0:58:24] <DeebzNutz100> time for hermit
[0:58:28] <DaKnightWarrior> nice
[0:58:34] <mr_sups> That was Leroy saying it was going to hurt
[0:58:36] <primaryfire> he also has a super strong stance that auto parries lows, a lot of moves that parry moves on startup and a parry that auto parries followups
[0:58:48] <alephalpha> Thanks to everyone I kinda gte it now
[0:58:50] <%CaptainPileDriver> jesus.
[0:59:05] <alephalpha> but surely they could have seen it coming if they just gaev him everything and mad eit all good
[0:59:07] <DaKnightWarrior> Leroy still really fun to play.
[0:59:09] <ikantreeed> aye yoooooo
[0:59:12] <primaryfire> you'd think so lmfao
[0:59:23] <%tearfuldevil> tekkens new character design philosphy is kind of
[0:59:25] <+TopTieramisu> @alephalpha gotta sell that dlc atpWind
[0:59:32] <%tearfuldevil> well, woolie was talking about it earlier
[0:59:42] <primaryfire> the fact that he was a literal god who ruined the game for 2 months was something that baffled everyone
[0:59:43] <+TopTieramisu> new tekken characters have generally been simplified but with really strong tools
[0:59:45] <ElPlasa> "but why sidestep when you can block and punish"
[0:59:47] <+Rivalsz> where the bryan mains at
[0:59:52] <alephalpha> Maybe the world shouls have just playe dthe umineko fighter
[0:59:57] <Mantisman01> RIIIIP
[0:59:58] <%CaptainPileDriver> @alephalpha it's more like they release the dlc with some busted shit then just nerf them later
[0:59:59] <%tearfuldevil> smash joke about "buy the dlc"
[1:00:00] <$StaceMcGate> Please let next match be Lucky Chloe vs Eddy

[1:01:22] <rsg220> reggie panic rage arts into leroy parries is mood
[1:01:24] <%CaptainPileDriver> i find tekken waaaaay more fun to watch than to play for me personally
[1:01:33] <count_bob> I feel like an idiot for asking.
[1:01:34] <%tearfuldevil> you think anything in tekken comes close to proper whale hunting
[1:01:47] <%tearfuldevil> you aint seen real pay to win
[1:01:48] <count_bob> But are there infinites in Tekken?
[1:01:51] <%tearfuldevil> no
[1:01:52] <primaryfire> no
[1:01:54] <+vaporousTippler> Reggie's evolving. No one hit b.
[1:01:55] <+Rivalsz> hell no
[1:01:55] <DaKnightWarrior> nope
[1:01:56] <+ggbhtg> hell no
[1:01:59] <%CaptainPileDriver> @count_bob no, thank god

[1:02:12] <+TopTieramisu> whales have nothing to do with pay2win. they buy shit out of compulsion
[1:02:13] <%CaptainPileDriver> yeah, death combos are a thing
[1:02:14] <alephalpha> slap them knees reggie
[1:02:14] <primaryfire> there are 100% combos but they require certain stages and conditions like low health

[1:12:08] <+johnny_gogo> Lars is in NUNS2
[1:12:08] <+ggbhtg> don't forget the DINOSAUR FROM A MANGA
[1:12:08] <%Kriss1827> Lars was in NUNS2 tho
[1:12:11] <redrins> gon was absolutely the weirdest
[1:12:11] <%tearfuldevil> i forgot about fucking gon
[1:12:12] <KeiPrime> Gon is 100% the weirdest Crossover
[1:12:14] <snow_bush> VADER and SoulCalibur
[1:12:16] <%TheOneCalledRock> why do people hate these kinds of crossovers? they are really fun
[1:12:18] <peachy996> Gon > Negan
[1:12:18] <%CaptainPileDriver> OH GOD LARS IS IN NUNS2 I FORGOT
[1:12:20] <+RJay80> lucille give me strength
[1:12:22] <DaKnightWarrior> Cole was so weak in SFXTK

[1:12:30] <%RyTYoung> bonk
[1:12:31] <KaiserMario> Jesus, Cole McGrath from Infamous... What a classic fighting game character
[1:12:32] <Hammatime8> I think Nagan just looks tall because of his posture
[1:12:32] <xUrbanCarnage> Never forget Lars was in NUNS2
[1:12:32] <fuji_92> LUL
[1:12:33] <Monkeyweed21> LARS WAS IN NUNS
[1:12:34] <+ggbhtg> HOW SWAY
[1:12:37] <KeiPrime> Gon is still weirder than yoda
[1:12:38] <$StaceMcGate> People are saying Gon and I thought there was a Tekken X Hunter crossover
[1:12:43] <%tearfuldevil> nope
[1:12:43] <%CaptainPileDriver> LARS WAS IN NUNS 2 IDK WHY BUT HE WAS
[1:12:44] <+ducethegamer> money
[1:12:44] <+SuplexChardonnay> Literally, if Negan wasn't from TWD, he would be hype

[1:12:54] <+jiggy_snipe> I mean Negan is fun guy I guess with charisma
[1:12:55] <alephalpha> gon from hunter x hunter would be too cool of apick
[1:12:56] <DaCheekyOne> Easy peasy lemon squeazy
[1:12:58] <redrins> lars was in nuns 2 because kishimoto designed a costume for tekken 6

[2:15:51] <+PR0swagonist> Lars is anime
[2:15:52] <@Menitta> This is actually counterproductive. I should be working.
[2:15:54] <goose_attack_almanac> Asuka lookin like a snack
[2:15:54] <redrins> kishimoto drew a costume for lars
[2:15:55] <Solidnick18> reasons

[2:15:55] <spardanwarrior> Someone gives a wrong answer, gets called out on it and the entire chat starts spamming PJSalt
[2:15:55] <@Menitta> HE WAS IN NUNS2?!
[2:15:57] <%CaptainPileDriver> WHY LARS
[2:15:58] <@Menitta> WHY
[2:15:59] <%ironohki> You cool Woolie!
[2:15:59] <Tacobellx21> Lars in Storm 2 was fucking dope.
[2:16:00] <+Flutts_> Asuka always looks like a snack
[2:16:01] <%CaptainPileDriver> @Menitta YES
[2:16:02] <Gustyyafro> beCause kishimoto designed him
[2:16:02] <%tsoul_22> It's sad my daily routine have barely changed
[2:16:05] <%ChoculaUltra> best part was Lars straight up had guns instead of kunai/shuriken LUL
[2:16:07] <%Kriss1827> WHY
[2:16:07] <usurper_sos> Asuka a cute
[2:16:09] <%CaptainPileDriver> WHY NOT FUCKING YOSHIMITSU
[2:16:13] <+jiggy_snipe> also Lars was supposed to take over as the protag
[2:16:14] <alephalpha> nah that Pickachu that can ewgf
[2:16:15] <KeiPrime> lars IS a mishima
[2:16:19] <+Shotgundam009> SourPls
[2:16:20] <peachy996> Lars was new at the time so they wanted to push him
[2:16:25] <redrins> kishimoto literally designed the best lars costume
[2:16:26] <@Menitta> This is a Melty Blood character
[2:16:26] <TheShockVox> Kishi designed his alt costume
[2:16:31] <ikantreeed> @WoolieVersus I think Kishimoto designed lars from the beginning
[2:16:32] <+StrawberryPantsu> Lars is an honorary Mishima
[2:16:34] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus lars is a mishima remember
[2:16:36] <usurper_sos> 50%

[2:16:43] <Lysdexic9541> @woolieversus Apparently, it was because Kishimoto designed that outfit
[2:16:45] <+Quinn_Carter> It’s TMNT 2000 April O Neil

[2:29:06] <Heefnoff> Damn, was hoping for games. Good stream regardless!
[2:29:06] <%ironohki> @saltpiggu That's really interesting. I definitely improved when I learned that, but I tend to connect with very aggressive characters that prevent the other player time to make a choice. It's risk/reward though, because those characters tend to need to make more decisions per match, which are more chances to lose control.
[2:29:07] <peachy996> Next time I play Yoshi against you guys I won't be so wacky lol
