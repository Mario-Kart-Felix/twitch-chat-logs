[0:40:59] <%optimasmaximas> @emeraldsplasher it's one guy developing this tho, aparently since 2018 and possibly even before then, so it's a bit more understandable, hopefully in the future it's rollback
[0:41:10] <blackkanye> That is cool

[0:56:42] <alephalpha> @wait for the devs to get working on saving tina mroe
[0:56:48] <+Jaysky> Save Tina from HERSELF
[0:56:59] <%FuqBoiSlim> what form of power is this? lytMOTIVATED
[0:56:59] <Heavensguard92> Saving Tina is a trap
[0:57:13] <dellis80> oh, this is "Comrade Puncher"?
[0:57:22] <+Kyanta_Rojo> There are two Tina's in the game. Saving Tina lost weight to help her fly
[0:57:39] <%xeromage> this matchup
[0:57:43] <%emeraldskrull> woolieDATTEBAYO woolieVS woolieKICKDAD
[0:57:46] <+Kyanta_Rojo> The other Tina is very unconventional. Very heavy resource management for everything.
[0:57:52] <alephalpha> sica mixups ar eninet percent left rights
[0:57:55] <MiraLangsuir> That's some daddy Gaius shit right there.
[0:58:03] <alephalpha> sisc ais indeed one fo the best
[0:58:04] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:58:15] <cavefishes> this ain't street fighter
[0:58:32] <Man_in_the_Red> no it is
[0:58:34] <alephalpha> and the left right oki and setplay till they die
[0:58:38] <Man_in_the_Red> what do you mean
[0:58:40] <%FuqBoiSlim> be CRAZY!
[0:58:40] <alephalpha> she's the I-no of the game
[0:58:47] <%AngriestAngryArtist> wtf is this NRS games block damage!?
[0:58:52] <CelestialCage> Is that Raul Julia
[0:58:55] <+clapbeat> are there chip kills?
[0:58:57] <Super_Voltekka> Hopefully, this game is short enough for Woolie to play Street Fighter for real
[0:59:13] <@Solidus_113> chip does not kill
[0:59:19] <MiraLangsuir> YO PUNCH BOY WITH AXE IS HYPE
[0:59:24] <RedHotBoss> Wow what game is this? not street fighter the movie?
[0:59:33] <+clapbeat> bummer, gimme chip kills off the falcon punch
[0:59:45] <alephalpha> or evern ebtetr demon flip past them and then teleport to original side so the seal is a doubel crossup
[0:59:48] <Man_in_the_Red> you mean Yuzu
[0:59:54] <+Kyanta_Rojo> I feel like very 15 seconds we have to remention the name of this game.
[0:59:57] <+Kyanta_Rojo> E's Laf ++
[0:59:59] <@Solidus_113> but then you allow chip kills on the 80% HP fullscreen beam
[1:00:02] <alephalpha> she's like if yuzu and ky had a baby
[1:00:08] <lem______> @Kyanta_Rojo take a shot every time
[1:00:18] <+Kyanta_Rojo> Oh hey what's up lem
[1:00:20] <sinbad2058> is there lore for all this?

[1:01:53] <alephalpha> ye
[1:02:13] <RubyPilot> i think thats the most scuffed loading screen ive ever seen
[1:02:18] <+Kyanta_Rojo> ye Fightcade crew made an announcement on twitter on Jun 10th that they were working on it
[1:02:21] <alephalpha> some of the demon flip followups have their own followups
[1:02:21] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> surely a coincidence Kappa
[1:02:35] <%FuqBoiSlim> don't worry ya'll, he'll be playing the best SF later tonight Kappa

[1:54:41] <LeJunke> did e's laf already happen?
[1:54:45] <%relentingapunch> JCVD was coked outta his MIND
[1:54:46] <%ChoculaUltra> yes
[1:54:56] <LeJunke> ok thx!!
[1:55:02] <atomicxdj> question one: who is fighterpedia
[1:55:03] <%mighty_max_t> Chip Damage, Yay or Nay?
[1:55:04] <atomicxdj> ??
[1:55:06] <DSD24> Hi Reggie!
[1:55:07] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[1:55:09] <%relentingapunch> JCVD was doing a whole buncha coke during SF da movie
[1:55:10] <%SomersaultJustice> reggie, what was your favorite part of the street fighter movie
[1:55:13] <%CaptainPileDriver> hey reggie, why you always pick those basic poster characters
[1:55:16] <+Froyuken> Question 2: Why is Fighterpedia?
[1:55:20] <Super_Voltekka> Why won't SNK acknowledge May Lee anymore?
[1:55:22] <%mighty_max_t> Sorry Chip KILLS, yay or nay?
[1:55:23] <%trustycoyote> @relentingapunch Oh yeah. Heard it was BAD. Like coked out constantly
[1:55:28] <+gaemjurnalist> why is a fighting game
[1:55:47] <%relentingapunch> JCVD also had mad sex with Kylie Minogue
[1:55:48] <atomicxdj> Is fighterpedia the future's future?
[1:55:51] <%jiggy_snipe> chip damage is fine in slower paced games
[1:55:53] <%CaptainPileDriver> when you don't got the meter for super
[1:56:02] <%relentingapunch> Basically JCVD had a great time on the set of SF da movie
[1:56:05] <+JohnXuandou> I think it's fine as long as you have ways to challenge it, like in KoF
[1:56:05] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's the fact that the only way to win with chip is to spend ALL YOUR METER
[1:56:13] <@Solidus_113> chip should only kill when it's actually the last pixel
[1:56:25] <+mechatengu21> i hate spinnal
[1:56:30] <%doombawkzvs> I have a fighting game question: WHEN'S BERSUS @WoolieVersus (also PC build is almost out, I'll shoot you guys the copy once it drops, maybe even a pre-release woolie build?!?)
[1:56:30] <+Froyuken> Hmm...making only a super's chip damage kill sounds interesting.
[1:56:30] <Garrison27> Problems in sf4 are its problems, not a problem with chip kill itself
[1:56:36] <%CaptainPileDriver> like, i shouldn't have to waste a full meter to kill
[1:56:40] <Super_Voltekka> When will May Lee finally return to KOF?
[1:56:43] <Garrison27> I enjoy checkmates
[1:56:44] <TheArrow_> having to get the hit is SO MUCH more interesting in practice, in my opinion
[1:56:44] <+try4frijoles> you gotta have a defensive option to get out of chip ex. SF3 Parry
[1:56:54] <alephalpha> Generally not a fan of chip kills but I'm fine when specific characters have the cpapability because it gives them a certain threat
[1:56:55] <+mr_miyagucci> Chip is fine
[1:56:57] <alephalpha> like
[1:57:01] <%relentingapunch> Parry to get outta chip is a great alternative
[1:57:05] <%relentingapunch> imho
[1:57:16] <%doombawkzvs> Omae wa moe shinderu
[1:57:16] <alephalpha> so you ahve to play ina way that wouldn't put you in that range
[1:57:16] <%relentingapunch> See: EVo moment 47
[1:57:22] <+Dova573> its fine in 3s because you can parry iut of ir
[1:57:23] <LeJunke> gg has fd has an anti chip mechanic
[1:57:26] <%CaptainPileDriver> using your super and all your meter in round won cause they keep blocking sucks
[1:57:26] <+Dova573> of it
[1:57:32] <%CaptainPileDriver> *one
[1:57:35] <+Dova573> like
[1:57:46] <alephalpha> gg also has a bunch of other defensive mechanincs and movement stff so thinsg aren't always certain
[1:57:58] <%mighty_max_t> I'm fine with Chip Kills on more grounded FGs but for like hyper fighters? Maybe not
[1:57:59] <lem______> i like it when ppl need to play the game differently when it comes to endgame scenarios
[1:57:59] <LeJunke> yeah exactçy
[1:58:00] <alephalpha> like venom putting me in a checkmate aint too bad
[1:58:05] <%relentingapunch> Bithcing about a game comes form a place of love
[1:58:13] <%relentingapunch> Means you want a game to be better
[1:58:22] <alephalpha> why does gg still have proximity normals
[1:58:23] <%trustycoyote> @alephalpha stff?

[2:21:48] <@Solidus_113> this is the thread he's reading
[2:21:54] <Dapper_Cactuar> don't forget fireball recovery frames are based off of when the fireball lands, so it's super fast at close range and is longer at cross screen
[2:21:55] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's amazing
[2:21:59] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's so fucking stupid broke
[2:22:01] <%CaptainPileDriver> In SFTM, Ryu and Ken can control their own fireball to some extent, which makes possible to keep it stay on the screen.

[2:34:40] <+joeriley121> @Isaac_nilo_ in the final few scenes, yeah.
[2:34:42] <%doombawkzvs> @WoolieVersus due to the hitbox errors where characters can populate the same space, Akuma can loop hard tatsu on some characters in the corner for an infinite (because he keeps popping in and out of the enemy hitbox, negating some pushback that would prevent it otherwise)
[2:35:06] <heartlesshealer> ^

[2:48:38] <Neoxon> @WoolieVersus Did you hear about Ono no longer being in charge of the Capcom fighting game division (he got demoted this past April, Midori Yuasa replaced him)? He's basically just a mouthpiece now. I'm curious to hear your thoughts on how this would impact future Capcom fighting games.

This is because character hitboxes can intersect, negating the pushback that would prevent it otherwise because Akuma is moving into and out of the enemy character. It's the easiest infinite and one of the best cases of how broken the hit boxes can be (also I wanna see it BibleThump It's my favorite one)
