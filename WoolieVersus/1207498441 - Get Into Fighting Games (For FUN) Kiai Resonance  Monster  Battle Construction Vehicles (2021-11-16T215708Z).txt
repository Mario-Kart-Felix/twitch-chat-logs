[3:55:51] <definitelynotjayy> tigurr genocide
[3:55:59] <GeltonZ> My big beef is just the, as I mentioned, lack of female furrys. Japan views beast traits as "manly" so almost all JP furrys are beefy dudes.
[3:56:10] <double_zr_tap> the music is kinda loud
[3:56:15] <definitelynotjayy> music is mixed kinda loud in game, but its fine on stream

[4:01:09] <DensityD> I bet egypt cat is very competitive against others, of regular height
[4:01:11] <+mulljade12> Johan Liebert looks a lil different than I remember
[4:01:18] <+DeaconBluesClues> I think with such short normals katze must be a combo character or have crossups or something
[4:01:20] <DensityD> small face fall to the ground
[4:01:20] <dds333a> @ozavic would Woolie's not be too obvious Kappa

[4:04:38] <dds333a> @jobbedbone OOZING lore, shit is awesome
[4:04:41] <+DeaconBluesClues> "Monster reduces attack speed but increases damage for a tankier gameplay style; freedom reduces damage and allows moves to be cancelled into each other for rushdown-oriented play; and tranquility emphasizes defense and improves moves' invincibility properties." @WoolieVersus

[4:19:50] <%baka_sugoi> Was this in a Scrublord vid back in the day?
[4:19:59] <GeltonZ> @WackyGear Females are human. No female furrys. It's a Japanese thing. They don't like female furrys because beast traits are seen as manly.
[4:20:08] <dds333a> @baka_sugoi yeah
[4:20:09] <$JobbedBone> m6kwpressaKromegalul
[4:20:29] <Super_Voltekka> @anangryhamster They ran off with the money didn't they?

[4:21:26] <$JobbedBone> if they are, it looks really good
[4:21:28] <dds333a> @baka_sugoi I dont think it was I just think he's playing it again, and the game was always solid LUL
[4:21:45] <rcand9> arcsys eat your heart out this indie furry game did it first

[4:22:25] <GeltonZ> @WackyGear (Since the bot cut me off) Krystal was made by Rare, she's not a Japanese character. Also they make her muzzle shorter in Japan.
[4:22:33] <+WackyGear> @GeltonZ I stand corrected
[4:23:08] <dds333a> BIG FINISH
[4:23:16] <GeltonZ> @WackyGear I mean there ARE exceptions like Tail Concerto but they are rare. This is why Sonic kisses Elise. That's seen as less weird in Japan because Sonic is the player avatar.

[4:54:51] <+Superbro64> Maybe one day we will have a true sequel to sigil fighters. Perhaps DNF the Duel can be that game
[4:54:57] <Super_Voltekka> Whang should make a video about it
[4:55:09] <+Superbro64> Sigil Fighter is a very specific energy, your right there

[5:00:44] <%ManOfReason> SHOOT THE CLOCK
[5:00:47] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> PogChamp
[5:00:47] <@Solidus_113> there's a BlazBlue Bullet targeting system
[5:00:54] <Marakami_Sadaneo> Let's rock baby
[5:01:18] <dds333a> Also to answer the question: OTONASHIKU NETERO
[5:01:23] <DaKnightWarrior> Can't wait to try him.
[5:01:34] <dds333a> since xrd
[5:01:37] <+EchoXOF> Man, I'll be Mad if Asuka ain't in Season 1
[5:01:37] <@Solidus_113> He's in Jack-O's arcade intro
[5:01:38] <PunishedRaccoon> PunishedRaccoon subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[5:01:47] <dds333a> that's where hes named
[5:02:00] <%townzzzzz> not a valentine
[5:02:09] <+Enderou> @EchoXOF saaaaaaame
[5:02:13] <+Superbro64> its not very clear to me, because apparently That Man *also* made his own Happy Chaos, yet there was a Happy Chaos thag existed before that?
[5:02:20] <+Superbro64> Its kinda confusing
[5:02:24] <@Solidus_113> there's a bullet meter above the tension gauge
[5:02:57] <SunsetJack> He is classified as a shooter like Ramlethal in the official site.
[5:03:21] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> o-only logical to follow up the full zoner with Jam...r-right? please?
[5:03:31] <dds333a> just magic casting LUL
[5:03:36] <+Superbro64> @kosorsomesaykosm_ slayer, take it or leave it
[5:03:47] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @Superbro64 NotLikeThis
[5:03:56] <@Solidus_113> slow it down if you need LUL
[5:03:56] <+Superbro64> doodSteve
[5:04:01] <dds333a> maybe even setup character
[5:04:09] <dds333a> for asuka, I mean
[5:04:12] <%DashXero> Crap. I missed the trailer...
[5:04:20] <yukichocomilk> I love the theme
[5:04:21] <SunsetJack> Pay attention on the time out cause it has UI.
[5:04:23] <@Solidus_113> He's got a targeting system and a bullet meter
[5:04:23] <+tsamxxx> white palms
[5:04:24] <+DukeBlack_> that man + moon level

[5:04:36] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1457949040566575106?t=WRD3hhRxnZrnVQfqKaaqMA&s=19
[5:04:40] <%DashXero> A third shot
[5:04:48] <dds333a> just a staggered shot
[5:04:57] <+Superbro64> you can fram by fram by pausing with k and pressing the < and > keys @woolieversus
[5:05:04] <dds333a> that's the mixup
[5:05:05] <+Superbro64> *frame by frame
[5:05:09] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> now if elphelt gets added they can have a nice ole shootout
[5:05:17] <double_zr_tap> you can use < and > keys to move the video frame by frame
[5:05:20] <dds333a> walking and shooting to
[5:05:21] <SunsetJack> So my theory, he has specials that moves him or put him into stance and aim and he chooses when to shoot.
[5:05:23] <%DashXero> This guy gives me Adachi vibes.
[5:05:24] <BlackermanZX> you could mute it and slow it down
[5:05:42] <dds333a> buff?
[5:05:43] <+RenoDeGeneric> A buddy of mine was thinking it's like the Gundam Vs lock on. Hard lock is orange when standing still and soft is green when moving.
[5:05:51] <dds333a> gauge too
[5:05:56] <SunsetJack> He rolls in by the way after he shots.
[5:06:08] <Th3rd3> bullet meter
[5:06:15] <+Enderou> wait hold up
[5:06:19] <@Solidus_113> 2 meters
[5:06:20] <+Enderou> wtf is that blue meter?
[5:06:27] <+Enderou> is that clone meter?
[5:06:36] <+fizzguy47> like Naoto
[5:06:37] <@Solidus_113> blue could be targeting, it goes down on shot
[5:06:38] <dds333a> his gauge too woolz
[5:06:39] <Th3rd3> could be
[5:06:41] <+0dinpen> or maybe a timer for another bullet?
[5:06:47] <%kyh9> Oh wait, live reaction?
[5:06:49] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> oh yeah could be clone meter
[5:06:53] <+Enderou> i really feel that's clone meter
[5:07:08] <dds333a> @kyh9 in a manner of speaking LUL LUL
[5:07:09] <SunsetJack> Gauge goes down as he shots.
[5:07:17] <dds333a> Interesting
[5:07:18] <+Enderou> oh so like jack-o?
[5:07:19] <DaKnightWarrior> strange
[5:07:25] <+Enderou> like servant gauge
[5:07:28] <@Solidus_113> it's the targeting reset?
[5:07:29] <BlackermanZX> shot restricion so you can't spam
[5:07:32] <+clevernamewhere> lock on?
[5:07:33] <Th3rd3> lock-on gauge?
[5:07:37] <%ManOfReason> maybe the meter modifies the bullets?
[5:07:47] <SunsetJack> Rate of fire maybe?
[5:07:52] <+Superbro64> maybe the more precise the lock on reticle, the less guage he spends?
[5:07:53] <dds333a> normal shots and ock on then
[5:07:56] <+Enderou> wait it drains while he walks
[5:08:00] <%Mathochism> I think the meter might control the retical.
[5:08:01] <%townzzzzz> CHAOS METER
[5:08:01] <+Enderou> so special move lock?
[5:08:06] <Hyphen_Sum> The gun also glows green with the shots so maybe a modifier of some sort
[5:08:11] <SofterCrash> maybe the shooting while walking is eating the bar?
[5:08:17] <dds333a> maybe he can train the reticle on somebody
[5:08:24] <fangovafang> LUL LUL LUL he shoots da timer
[5:08:34] <Th3rd3> is that counter?
[5:08:37] <dds333a> BIG SHOOTS
[5:08:41] <%kyh9> Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas motherfucker
[5:08:48] <SunsetJack> That super seems to auto-track lol
[5:08:48] <KNYGHT87> I wonder if meter determines the range @DashXero
[5:08:48] <dds333a> that super looks like an unload too
[5:08:55] <+Enderou> my guess is you start a stance and he starts draining meter like while he walks and if you shoot it takes a set ammount of meter too
[5:09:03] <%DashXero> @KNYGHT87 That would be pretty cool.
[5:09:22] <+Superbro64> the reticle went orange during the ky scene @woolieversus
[5:09:31] <SunsetJack> HUD to show time over animation lol
[5:09:44] <+fizzguy47> elphelt was busted
[5:09:48] <dds333a> unlimited meter as a temp buff
[5:09:53] <%kyh9> What if he can extend the time of the match?
[5:09:54] <dds333a> ?
[5:09:54] <@Solidus_113> My guess is the longer you wait to shoot the more accurate the shot will be, and it could stagger
[5:10:03] <+Enderou> i think it gets orange when it's low
[5:10:08] <%kyh9> Would love it if him shooting the time meter actually affected gameplay
[5:10:09] <@Solidus_113> counter shot maybe
[5:10:11] <SunsetJack> Orange if he delays the shot.
[5:10:15] <dds333a> normal shot and guage
[5:10:18] <Hyphen_Sum> Like a counter?
[5:10:19] <dds333a> I think
[5:10:20] <+RenoDeGeneric> He goes into a shooting stance and it turns orange
[5:10:23] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> there's also a small black reticle thing in the hud clip, I think
[5:10:24] <AlFredo_Taken> Tension gun?
[5:10:27] <SofterCrash> the red reticle looks like the effect of the shooting stance
[5:10:36] <SofterCrash> he was standing still
[5:10:52] <dds333a> he plants
[5:10:53] <FaxineiroDePosto> he hit leo with an orange reticule and it guard crushed
[5:11:08] <dds333a> yeah, he plants both feet
[5:11:18] <@Solidus_113> focused stance shot that'll stagger and break guard likely
[5:11:21] <+Enderou> happy chaos color up?
[5:11:23] <fangovafang> she was fun
[5:11:23] <SunsetJack> All I say, he can choose to shot when he goes in a stance or the stance that walks forward.
[5:11:24] <Hyphen_Sum> 236+k
[5:11:45] <+Superbro64> elphelt stance had a dodge roll, the shotgun, and a command grab
[5:11:45] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[5:11:53] <Hyphen_Sum> Literally played her yesterday
[5:11:54] <dds333a> LUL LUL LUL
[5:11:55] <SofterCrash> maybe eats bar in different ways depending on stance
[5:11:59] <dds333a> absolutely nada
[5:12:04] <%fetrigon> LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL
[5:12:05] <+Superbro64> only played xrd sign tho
[5:12:07] <DaKnightWarrior> Legit nothing.
[5:12:19] <fangovafang> be like 7 seconds lol
[5:12:22] <dds333a> always end with a super too for Fighterz Kappa
[5:12:27] <@Solidus_113> we got 2 and a half weeks
[5:12:36] <+Superbro64> kof trailers wildy vary between high and low quality trailers lol
[5:13:05] <dds333a> does noel count Kappa Kappa
[5:13:11] <roboyuji> I assume they'll do the full moves video later
[5:13:22] <+fizzguy47> can't believe Gobou went undefeated with Zato, then pulled Goldlewis out for the final
[5:13:39] <dds333a> @fizzguy47 LUL LUL
[5:13:50] <+Superbro64> what made elphelt good was (in xrd sign) she could use pineberry block stun to unblockable with the rifle reticle lock. Happy Chaos doesnt seem to have that lockdown, or an unblockable @wool
[5:14:05] <+Superbro64> @woolieversus at least as far as I can tell
[5:14:06] <+fizzguy47> He was grinning throughout the final like a villain
[5:14:14] <%jinking79> heavy execution character
[5:14:28] <@Solidus_113> It'll be something to laugh at hopefully
[5:14:32] <aka_Jigawatt> i cant wait for the live action one piece
[5:14:32] <dds333a> how could it?
