[0:05:18] <jimjamstrawberryslamalam> Ah yes the Samurai diss
[0:05:20] <DatAsuna> @jevichrono not that far actually
[0:05:23] <%Gruhunchously> @WoolieVersus I have much in the way pf unsolicited advice, but primarily - Talk to HK-47 some more, and keep him in the party, especially if Greater Goods need to be done. He has fantastic dialogue in his influence tree.
[0:05:50] <nepwar> jedi master devin
[0:05:54] <+wunp_fxs> same v

[0:13:19] <%andrei11dr> But there are a lot of HK encounters in this game
[0:13:22] <grandark_z317> @cisealnine this is more Mandom's power than KC.
[0:13:22] <%jiggy_snipe> it didnt show it
[0:13:25] <%lotharrio> I think Mira told you where to find him so you went there, solo.

[0:14:57] <+Bluemanzee> Wow I never knew this
[0:15:13] <%Gruhunchously> @zocano Fun fact, if Goto is in your party at certain times time bounty hunters come after you, he will tell them that the bounty is recinded and make them stop.

[0:15:37] <%SirGO0SE> thats rad
[0:15:48] <%lotharrio> It's restored content, yeah.
[0:15:57] <%Gruhunchously> @WoolieVersus He does
[0:16:05] <Zouledge> @Gruhunchously been playing this game for years and i never knew that
[0:16:08] <%andrei11dr> You'd think Reeven wouldn't program him with that, since he's a special model
[0:16:12] <%Djinnazz> Game audio is kinda low
[0:16:13] <zocano> @gruhunchously ya I figured that might happen with certain bounty hunter engagements
[0:16:18] <%Gruhunchously> @WoolieVersus He has more things to say about them if you ask
[0:16:45] <%SirGO0SE> i think he upped it, sounds fine ya?
[0:16:50] <zocano> Ya there’s no hk dialogue about it
[0:16:53] <zocano> It’s weird
[0:17:06] <zocano> Probably a planned thing that couldn’t make it

[0:18:23] <+Bluemanzee> It's like poetry
[0:18:38] <zocano> I find it odd that low influence for a party member doesn’t shift them to the opposite type of jedi
[0:18:48] <BallerSwagBro9k> @lotharrio Dont u mean 1999?
[0:18:52] <+kekkerscrew> Having party members angry at you unlocks good stuff for them
[0:18:54] <%lotharrio> @zocano Atton has that feature actually.

[0:19:03] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:19:10] <DatAsuna> @zocano well it's low influence, not negative influence
[0:19:11] <+spacehouse> Cheer1500 Regarding your introspection being mislabeled as excuses, goes to the heart of one of humanity's oldest philosophical problems, that no person can truly understand another or objective reality, discussed in the "Tractatus logico philosophicus" and is a central theme in "Wonderful Everyday". A game that is NOT FOR THE FEINT OF HEART OR FEINT OF MIND. Recommend anyone with a taste for philosophical & introspective games to give SubaHibi a try. Especially in these interesting times.
[0:19:14] <a_mad_dragon> this is why i want a mod that gives EVERY character's reactions to a given event, whether they're in your party or not
[0:19:15] <%lotharrio> @BallerSwagBro9k I was gonna look up the exact date, but lost interest.
[0:19:24] <%kyh9> These guys are so fucking racist
[0:19:31] <zocano> Oh it’s only atton? My bao-dur was still a dark jedi on my low influence dark side playthrough
[0:19:41] <%kyh9> Just, their design looks absurdly like old racist caricatures
[0:20:09] <heartlesshealer> jealously hoard feat points
[0:20:09] <shincadad> You weren’t level 18 the last time you talked to Handmaiden
[0:20:11] <zocano> Bao dur still gives into hate for dark side but low influence
[0:20:14] <zocano> For example
[0:20:16] <+mighty_max_t> I thought Reggie was the one who looks at feets
[0:20:32] <zocano> Instead of you calming him for light side
[0:20:35] <+evbites> My whole race was derived from nazi propaganda give me coins
[0:20:45] <heartlesshealer> Hmm
[0:20:55] <%lotharrio> Fists are not melee.
[0:21:05] <zocano> Fists are their own category
[0:21:05] <Goodvibes99508> you can get it another way anyway
[0:21:10] <+thatotherblackkid> fists are unarmed
[0:21:13] <%lotharrio> I'm just one guy, but fists are not melee
[0:21:18] <heartlesshealer> so hard DND rules on fists
[0:21:18] <%Gruhunchously> @evbites To be fair (not really but) that kind of racism was hardly limited to the Nazis. The Nazis just took it farther than anyone else.
[0:21:22] <DatAsuna> They're not melee
[0:21:24] <zocano> They do not benefit from melee weapons
[0:21:28] <SlashingIce> Dueling
[0:21:31] <CaptainBright> unarmed specialist is not melee
[0:21:37] <zocano> Same with dueling and two handing
[0:21:39] <carlosmiyamoto> Level 18 dueling
[0:21:39] <nepwar> i think it doesn't count melee since theres a whole feat on punching
[0:21:44] <vulkan_vibes> Dueling!
[0:21:46] <+evbites> true but i though of the joke so ehhh
[0:21:56] <liljojofett> Dueling

[0:22:49] <+thatotherblackkid> you fixed it but fuck you though
[0:23:12] <zocano> I think it’s to skip around and avoid the center area railroad trigger

[0:23:44] <%mitchteck> I couldn’t figure out how to trigger the main quest because of that fucking speeder
[0:23:47] <halfmasks> @lotharrio not too bad thanks
[0:23:49] <%Gruhunchously> The speeder is primarily for influence
[0:23:53] <nepwar> its a bao durr influencer
[0:23:57] <Skullyton175> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[0:24:03] <zocano> I fucked up on my dark side and hit the main quest super fast before I did really anything on nar shadaa

[0:24:31] <JaceDarkstar> @woolieversus I did testing on the xbox version you can use the speeder to bypass the trigger for the slavers
[0:24:31] <nepwar> oh i hope theres something
[0:24:41] <dorpork> its a bug
[0:24:45] <heartlesshealer> HMMM
[0:24:49] <dorpork> goto will leave if you enter with him. this is a bug

[0:25:03] <vulkan_vibes> yeah my got left
[0:25:19] <%Djinnazz> finally gettin PAID

[0:26:14] <%SirGO0SE> it super video game economy
[0:26:14] <Tucker0603> it's bullshit
[0:26:23] <zocano> Part of it is the loot tables
[0:26:25] <CaptainBright> economy of the videogame
[0:26:29] <restingbones> Oh my god no
[0:26:29] <%jiggy_snipe> its video game economy?
[0:26:30] <%lotharrio> Guns are droids are expensive. But you can probably live off of however much a standard blaster costs.
[0:26:48] <+jake5713> Woolie's used to fillin' them...POCKETSSSS!
[0:26:50] <Ravenian96> Price discrepancy is just going to get worse lol
[0:26:52] <%Space_Pagan> Here's some spare change!
[0:26:54] <%SirGO0SE> the fucking FGC pays out better than this!
[0:26:56] <%jiggy_snipe> more ludonarrative dissonance?
[0:26:57] <+Freeborg1997> Hard times, because of the dark side
[0:26:58] <+Bluemanzee> At 1st game's level cap, but only 1 planet finished so far. I feel like thi sgame is bigger than I remember
[0:27:00] <%Gruhunchously> Go out and come back it
[0:27:06] <zocano> Swoop racing pays a ton on a later planet
[0:27:11] <CaptainBright> I just did the swoop races of onderon; they give you close to 5 figures worth of credits
[0:27:25] <+MrBaldachin> @Bluemanzee it slows down real hard after 20
[0:27:26] <%andrei11dr> I guess they're ALLL just scamming the fuck out you
[0:27:34] <%SirGO0SE> i mean thats a pretty cool droid..
[0:27:39] <%lotharrio> He's like T3 just... more specialized in fighting droids.

[0:28:49] <%Gasgrave> gasgrave converted from a Twitch Prime sub to a Tier 1 sub!
[0:28:49] <heartlesshealer> Don't do Nero like that
[0:28:50] <%Gruhunchously> No...no. Goto is Arkham.
[0:28:53] <%FallenAngelZelos> Aww didn’t know we started already. What I miss?
[0:28:56] <StarlitStunner> I prefer him to T3 because he actually talks instead of beeps, and as a dark side droid I feel he has synergy with HK
[0:29:02] <%SirGO0SE> i thought that said Droid Thick

[0:29:03] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[0:29:12] <Sarl109> he can use the zap arm though
[0:29:14] <%lotharrio> He also doesn't set off mines.
[0:29:14] <+Freeborg1997> @evbites *Goto steps between HK and T3* I'm putting a stop... to this sibling rivalry.
[0:29:17] <Exodusprime1256> statement: SCUM
[0:29:18] <+MrBaldachin> it's a cool mechanic but there's no context where you'd ever need it

[0:29:26] <restingbones> Im sitting here, having a good time watching woolie play Star war. And now is the time I learn Bernie officially has dropped out. The day is ruined.
[0:29:28] <Sarl109> G0-t0 does all T3 does but is immune to Mines
[0:29:29] <Daxalog> Why is he so high up on the character view screen? Is it because his model is just animated higher to simulate flight?
[0:29:33] <%lotharrio> But yeah, he's superfluous.
[0:29:34] <Reizie_Etherealm> Observation: This party is getting crazy
[0:29:34] <+Brandon__Brando> someone with more money finish the hype train!
[0:29:42] <Jaku2011> Ya he actually talks which makes him way more interesting to T3 who cares about power the main character is op af
[0:29:45] <+evbites> just put a sheet over goto and push him in the corner like a parrot
[0:29:47] <+MrBaldachin> you can't teach handmaiden and disciple afaik which is sad
[0:29:54] <%FallenAngelZelos> Hey chat did I miss anything interesting? Thanks!
[0:30:30] <StarlitStunner> @mrbaldachin GoTo not setting off mines is a mechanic I think obsidian did better later on with ED-E in New Vegas who had the same ability.
[0:30:30] <%Gruhunchously> He' proto Mister House
[0:30:38] <%lotharrio> "Just stop all your fucking magic wars, assholes!"
[0:30:48] <heartlesshealer> man, fuck big money
[0:30:49] <%jiggy_snipe> @fallenangelzelos not really, they fought some HK assassins
[0:30:54] <Tomas2886Cz> @fallenangelzelos nah, you're good
[0:30:57] <DatAsuna> he's the most greater goods
[0:31:00] <zanzibarian_hamster> "moral relativist", not evil.

[0:32:09] <%lotharrio> @Zanco23 That's later.
[0:32:10] <+evbites> i wonder if there has ever been a case where a person was so rich that they had to create a new currency
[0:32:32] <%Gruhunchously> No Sex in the Mandalorian Room
[0:32:37] <%lotharrio> @evbites Basically that's old company towns in the USA.
[0:32:37] <RantingRavager> That currency is TIGERS
[0:32:45] <%lotharrio> I guess Disney dollars, too?
[0:32:57] <zocano> Pretty sure you can just talk to the mandos right now
[0:33:01] <zocano> And just walk away

[0:33:03] <+Freeborg1997> @lotharrio Oh, I could have sworn it was on Nar Shaddaa
[0:33:22] <%lotharrio> @Zanco23 It will be. Just need to do quests on other worlds to unlock it.

[0:38:47] <%Gruhunchously> UNLiiiiiiiiiMITED POWAHHHHH
[0:38:50] <DatAsuna> it's very unnecessary when you're already so OP
[0:38:50] <+gutlesscoward> skullet boi
[0:39:15] <+MrBaldachin> force channel is definitely the way to go still
[0:39:23] <donstylo> From the Jedi who looks like the father from the Orange County Chopper show.
[0:39:23] <@Moobot> That's a tad too many emotes, @ggbhtg (warning)
[0:39:25] <%chiazam> what did I miss?

[0:39:50] <%lotharrio> @mankeyfigh Force Storm shenanigans and a few HK fights.
[0:39:51] <%FallenAngelZelos> @mankeyfigh some HK fights and leveling up GoTo
[0:39:51] <ggbhtg> yovgLUL yovgDorf doodSprinkle doodScrub
[0:39:53] <$SilverRoddo> Remember, don’t speak moistly.
[0:40:04] <%chiazam> No Handmaiden fight?
[0:40:17] <%lotharrio> Not yet, they're slowly working towards the ship for that.
[0:40:24] <%Gruhunchously> Two crates instead of twenty four
[0:40:24] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:40:34] <agrippaarpeggio> under?
[0:41:04] <Zouledge> Not 12 , didn’t he say 2 dozen which is 24 crates ?
[0:41:05] <nepwar> I dont think it will give you ds points if you choose that
[0:41:06] <ggbhtg> neither siding
[0:41:06] <Tucker0603> I love how you use force lightning in SWTOR as a sith assassin. you literally shoot it into your lightsaber to supercharge it
[0:41:09] <+MidnightBurst12> haggling over someone's life?
[0:41:10] <Deadbulky> Chaotic Neutral
[0:41:15] <Tucker0603> he's a grey jedi
[0:41:16] <DatAsuna> qui-gon's considered gray
[0:41:17] <%lotharrio> "Can you even BELIEVE that guy offered me all this money to scare you away? I don't really wanna but it's SO MUCH money."
[0:41:19] <%siamzero94> qui gon is a bitch though
[0:41:25] <%SirGO0SE> he a binch
[0:41:31] <nepwar> haggling is not a against the code
[0:41:34] <user_naim> He wasn’t getting points though
[0:41:43] <+Freeborg1997> Qui-Gon was played by Liam Neeson. He has a dark side.
[0:41:45] <+evbites> he discovered force ghosts
[0:41:51] <Zouledge> Quigon is usually considered a grey Jedi though
[0:41:51] <DatAsuna> Qui-gon takes his lightsaber and goes out on the town hoping black men will start fights with him
[0:41:52] <Redblood801> For a Duros, the species that discovered Hyper Space Travel, Oondar is an idiot.
[0:41:58] <%andrei11dr> Qui Gom is follower of the hustler way
[0:41:59] <Malik1002> where John at
[0:42:08] <Malik1002> ?
[0:42:08] <%Gruhunchously> @Zanco23 He wanted to beat the dark side with a cosh.
[0:42:10] <+Bluemanzee> John is asleep rn
[0:42:20] <%lotharrio> Qui-Gon has a certain set of Jedi skills.
[0:42:26] <+Urgoslav> Qui Gon fucks

[0:43:29] <user_naim> what a fucking chad our character is
[0:43:34] <psidefx> You could have seen his inventory earlier before you accepted the quest
[0:43:44] <zocano> "a little"
[0:43:54] <%SirGO0SE> cute rodian saleswoman gf
[0:44:01] <%lotharrio> I think you may have messed it up, V.
[0:44:18] <+kekkerscrew> You're pretty smart for one of those people
[0:44:21] <Goodvibes99508> talking to her activates it
[0:44:26] <ingman112> Go offer to take the other guy’s deal and it should proc
[0:44:26] <Deadbulky> Messed it up by not doing option one of match her discount
[0:44:31] <+Bluemanzee> She's not cute she's just Greedo with a feminine voice
[0:44:34] <%Djinnazz> "Young man, you speak so well!"
[0:44:34] <Deadbulky> Yeah
[0:44:37] <nepwar> you need to piss of ooderon more so he says no merchant will deal with you
[0:44:57] <%FallenAngelZelos> Save first

[0:45:46] <Shady_Squid> The younglings!
[0:45:46] <nepwar> i killed 911 and they gave me a roomba
[0:45:57] <ChloeFleurage> I love how cartoonishly evil you can get in kotor 2
[0:46:08] <ChloeFleurage> like force persuading muggers into giving you all their stolen cash and jumping in a pit
[0:46:10] <%andrei11dr> Even the firefighters?
[0:46:20] <+Razputin217> I AM THE LAW
[0:46:22] <+BigDumBeak> He calls 911 and Phan picks up his phone slowely from his pocket, ringing.
[0:46:30] <+Bluemanzee> I guess I do now that I think about it

[0:50:41] <nepwar> a lightsaber: best i can give is 50. a small gand stabby stabby: I'LL TAKE YOUR ENTIRE STOCK
[0:50:41] <%Gruhunchously> King Arthurs armor in a world where the Knights of the Round Table are still a major political force.
[0:51:04] <gruulmagebeast> did they finish the cutscene extravaganza
[0:51:09] <+Bluemanzee> Even nowadays his armor would be inflated in price due to the association
[0:51:14] <%lotharrio> "Heavy" Slap that onto Handmaiden!
[0:51:36] <alrobot2014> little gand sticks worth more than LIGHTSABERS
[0:51:45] <ScreamLord> poorly
[0:51:47] <+Bluemanzee> It works by not working
[0:51:58] <DatAsuna> it doesn't, every story decides the value of credits as and when the authro wants
[0:52:06] <FeelsRoMan> star wars economy is this, credits are credits and if we focused on inflation with millions of planets we would go insane
[0:52:12] <%GraceTBM> other people can use gand silencers, most people can't use lightsabers, i guess that's why they sell for less
[0:52:16] <DatAsuna> and that's fine
[0:52:16] <Redblood801> The economy in Star Wars is great due to all the GALACTIC WARS that keep happening.
[0:52:19] <ralphfromdk> Bottom 2 are better
[0:52:22] <%lotharrio> OH the bar still has a drop you can pick up.
[0:52:36] <giga_bit> here comes the MONEY
[0:52:37] <%andrei11dr> Just sell the swords you'll never use them since you got the light sabers early

[0:55:28] <+jake5713> Can`t even bend over cuz his pak is so full·
[0:55:39] <+Bluemanzee> @deviljhojho_ Then you gotta cut it off. That's why we vomit in hoodies here
[0:55:43] <%Gruhunchously> Can we take all these credits and spend them on a therapy regimen for our entire party?
[0:55:57] <Merkensteiner> INVEST IN YOURSELF
[0:55:57] <+Freeborg1997> I mean if we can hold entire full-body armor in our pocket. I don't see why we can't hold on that money in as well.
[0:56:00] <Zouledge> Oddly I think economic of spice is easier to understand than credits
[0:56:05] <%Gigmunch> No man that isn’t my massive dong it’s just my credit pouch

[1:01:56] <deviljhojho_> hanharr 2: with a vengeance

[1:02:28] <zocano> I prefer Dantooine first but Nar Shadaa is absolutely the better "first" planet
[1:02:30] <%andrei11dr> Last party member is probably my favorite
[1:02:32] <%GraceTBM> woolie can't get d, right? who is the remaining companion?
[1:02:36] <gruulmagebeast> in the original version you dont even get hk till the end of nar shadaa

[1:03:18] <+Bluemanzee> Mira could have been better, but they dropped the ball on her

[1:03:21] <WanderingSwordsman> Why is Darth T3 blue?
[1:03:22] <zocano> seeing my T3 on dark side be truly Darth T3 is good
[1:03:23] <+Freeborg1997> Dante T3 and Vergil HK
[1:03:23] <%ChoculaUltra> T3's brilliant incandescence burns my eyes FeelsBadMan
[1:03:24] <DatAsuna> he's standing proud
[1:03:25] <ThePimpGuin> Even Palp couldn't hid his power like T3 can
[1:03:26] <%Djinnazz> the GOODEST boi
[1:03:26] <donstylo> I hope Woolie can finally talk with Visas.

[1:04:12] <ralphfromdk> Like all of Star Wars, the astro droid is the real hero in the end...
[1:04:18] <donstylo> The only thing that is more blue than T3 are Woolies balls because he can't talk with Gothgirl.
[1:04:22] <%ChoculaUltra> Read somewhere that JoJo fans were the vegans of the anime community and well, it's not wrong.

[1:07:46] <+QuadraticGravity> Out Friday
[1:07:51] <gruulmagebeast> is it on youtube yet?
[1:07:53] <+QuadraticGravity> They're talking as in the LP episode release time
[1:07:54] <AllTheZibas> Hoes mad? Hoes mad!
[1:08:52] <%GraceTBM> do silver
[1:08:52] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[1:09:04] <zocano> silver is ight
[1:09:08] <+Bluemanzee> whitesaber
[1:09:09] <DatAsuna> silver is fine but i ain't into it
[1:09:15] <Tucker0603> orange best color
[1:09:17] <donstylo> Black Lightsaber best Lightsaber.
[1:09:20] <giga_bit> the "OC do not steal" saber, still cool though
[1:09:20] <megamirk> it's no purple
[1:09:21] <ThePimpGuin> silver is fine, cyan and veridian are the best new colors tho
[1:09:22] <%Comradeiota> Better than the darksaber from Force Awakens
[1:09:23] <%Prevot> it's SO WHITE
[1:09:23] <DatAsuna> yee orange club
[1:09:29] <SinnerBeta> green, silver and gold are the best colors
[1:09:29] <%lotharrio> Silver is classic. It looks like the sabers Vader and Obi Wan fought with in New Hope.
[1:09:30] <%GraceTBM> orange is best color
[1:09:34] <zocano> I'm dumb and prefer the solid blue
[1:09:37] <+Bluemanzee> Blue and green sabers still fuck idc what anyone says
[1:09:37] <Zouledge> I enjoy it but red is best imo
[1:09:38] <%ChoculaUltra> dude those black aura'd lightsabers from SWTOR are too damn cool. My teenage self pats me on the back each time it goes vrrrrrm
[1:09:40] <zocano> purple is a close second
[1:09:40] <LeafarOz> the dark saber though leyGimmie
[1:09:43] <megamirk> purple for +2 to WIPEOUTS
[1:09:48] <%Puhff> Best color was black from Force UNleashed
[1:09:57] <%GraceTBM> force unleashed sucks, but it's black lightsaber was dope
[1:10:05] <giga_bit> viridian is the most underrated color
[1:10:17] <%GraceTBM> isn't viridian just light green
[1:10:22] <LeafarOz> mando jedi
[1:10:24] <giga_bit> yeah but it looks nice tho
[1:10:27] <%Gruhunchously> Yeah...but it's cool damnit
[1:10:29] <%GraceTBM> fair
[1:10:39] <gruulmagebeast> can you have other characters make stuff for you?
[1:10:50] <zocano> yes
[1:10:51] <%GraceTBM> between green and viridian i'll always choose the latter
[1:10:58] <ThePimpGuin> redone veridian is a more dark green and looks best
[1:11:02] <%emeraldskrull> woolieDATTEBAYO woolieDATTEBAYO
[1:11:07] <%GraceTBM> party members can make things in the world, just not on the ship
[1:11:10] <zocano> in fact it's usually better to do so since they might have certain stats higher
[1:11:11] <megamirk> Katarn has a blue lightsaber = blue is best
[1:11:15] <+Proxzo> Who ships Exar-Kun and I-Chan?
[1:11:26] <%GraceTBM> blue is the vanilla ice cream of lightsaber colros
[1:11:35] <megamirk> aka the best
[1:11:40] <ThePimpGuin> ohoho
[1:11:51] <%Gruhunchously> Which planet he could be talking about?
[1:12:01] <ThePimpGuin> i think duxon/ onderon
[1:12:02] <+vaporousTippler> Katarn only had a blue saber in Jedi Outcast. Because Lucasarts demanded they change it to blue.
[1:12:11] <%GraceTBM> from the ship, it should just grab the highest value from all your party members and use it
[1:12:14] <gruulmagebeast> COVID-19 aka the RAKGHOUL DISEASE
[1:12:15] <Goodvibes99508> cyan tho?
[1:12:20] <megamirk> yeah, in Dark Forces 2 he has a green one?
[1:12:23] <%GraceTBM> she would say NO
[1:12:28] <DatAsuna> not too hard, just no time
[1:12:30] <+Freeborg1997> @vaporousTippler Blue's a great color.
[1:12:32] <+vaporousTippler> Green and yellow, at different points.
[1:12:36] <%GraceTBM> "this is where i sit on the ship:
[1:12:36] <zocano> She absolutely would tell you no
[1:12:44] <zocano> She in fact has dialogue entirely about it
[1:13:00] <%Gruhunchously> Craft it yourself. What are you? Too *weak8?
[1:13:08] <+Bluemanzee> Might as well just use a sword Kappa
[1:13:10] <gruulmagebeast> are black sabers in this game?
[1:13:12] <%GraceTBM> god, K's skill request went undone for so long for me cause i never remembered to touch up my bad stats
[1:13:18] <%GraceTBM> no black sabers in this
[1:13:20] <Redblood801> Nope @gruulmagebeast
[1:13:22] <%GraceTBM> maybe in a mod
[1:13:22] <DatAsuna> Speaking of dev issues, darth scion was meant to have little shards of himelf floating around him but they couldn't get the particle system to work
[1:13:24] <LeafarOz> sad
[1:13:26] <SinnerBeta> love it, it's beautiful, goes well with bright jedi robes or black sith robes
[1:13:30] <BallerSwagBro9k> YEYEYEYEYEYE
[1:13:34] <%Space_Pagan> Finally!
[1:13:34] <+Bluemanzee> Black belt time

[1:13:43] <dead_harmony13> FINALLY
[1:13:43] <+Freeborg1997> I know a friend of mine who thinks Jedi should only have blue lightsabers, because they're the best color, and nothing else comes close.
[1:13:45] <+vaporousTippler> Final Destination

[1:16:05] <Redblood801> Atris is like Seath the Scaleless. A Bitch
[1:16:07] <Ravenian96> Atris about to get hit by the betrayal waves 10 million light years away lmao

[1:24:22] <+Ancopro> who's mad? hoes mad
[1:24:24] <YakumoYomi> "HOES MAD" has now been shortened to "Atris"
[1:24:26] <zocano> I will say, I prefer Handmaiden, but Disciple absolutely had more going on than I thought and found his scenes very interesting
[1:24:28] <giga_bit> Kreia has had a lot of team kills in Halo
[1:24:28] <Dangerzone979> betrayal tomatoKnife tomatoDry
[1:24:31] <%GraceTBM> woolie needs to cream his brain in visas' quarters
[1:24:38] <Deadbulky> Make her big tank
[1:24:40] <+MrBaldachin> you still need that force speed tho
[1:24:43] <zocano> Disciple's and Kreia's scenes are incredibly insightful
[1:24:49] <+atin2000> Finally all caught up, hope Im not super late
[1:24:52] <%Gruhunchously> @zocano Disciple gets a raw deal in the game and in the fandom, but he's alright.
[1:24:59] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Silver saber <3
[1:25:20] <%GraceTBM> silver is the perfect color for woolie's love of gray jedi
[1:25:22] <+Freeborg1997> Kreia keeps turning everyone against us. What are you doing?
[1:25:25] <+theKingRamses> does this mean miraluka time
[1:25:28] <ThePimpGuin> I wonder who the silver saber might go well with now
[1:25:45] <%Gruhunchously> 4 is new
[1:25:49] <SinnerBeta> Please get Fann's special crystal next please
[1:25:53] <Deadbulky> 4
[1:25:55] <Safarihat> ASK HER ABOUT THE FORCE
[1:25:56] <CaptainBright> Ask her about the force
[1:25:58] <zocano> weird huh
[1:26:02] <YakumoYomi> @Gruhunchously Agreed. Being a "gender-locked" companion means that most players are probably not going to get him as an ally
[1:26:04] <zocano> so many Jedi
[1:26:04] <SinnerBeta> a cargohold of Jedis
[1:26:05] <Iwashi94> Jedi stonks
[1:26:06] <+charmquarke> the space Winnebago
[1:26:08] <%GraceTBM> ask about her force
[1:26:08] <ralphfromdk> Jedi clown car
[1:26:10] <+Bluemanzee> They started breeding when Atton wasn't looking
[1:26:10] <giga_bit> Too Many Jedi
[1:26:12] <%emeraldskrull> woolieDATTEBAYO
[1:26:14] <%Gruhunchously> Thank god

[1:26:22] <%Djinnazz> Shade from across the cosmos!
[1:26:23] <+Freeborg1997> Too much build up...
[1:26:31] <%Gruhunchously> No it doesn't
[1:26:32] <Jaku2011> No
[1:26:32] <DatAsuna> Nope
[1:26:33] <TDAWS_MP132> not quite
[1:26:35] <zocano> No
[1:26:37] <LeafarOz> ask gramma about the force
[1:26:38] <DatAsuna> V was just minmaxing you
[1:26:40] <%lotharrio> Nope
[1:26:47] <%Gruhunchously> That's not true, he's lying
[1:26:49] <DatAsuna> it just slows you down
[1:26:58] <ggbhtg> Atris is making a flame war slam video right now
[1:26:58] <zocano> I talked with both equally in my first playthrough and never had an issue
[1:26:59] <%jiggy_snipe> slows the process
[1:27:00] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Almost like the Exile is single-handedly responsible for rebuilding the order after its collapse
[1:27:01] <+MrBaldachin> I don't ever remember having to do this
[1:27:02] <giga_bit> That's true, but also false
[1:27:02] <+kekkerscrew> V wanted to speedrun it
[1:27:06] <%GraceTBM> you were just on the threshold, really close
[1:27:15] <Ravenian96> It's literally just if Visas influence up Handmaiden no like unless Handmaiden max
[1:27:22] <ggbhtg> But is it DRASTIC GO DOWN?
[1:27:22] <+wunp_fxs> fuckin ofc they did
[1:27:23] <Tucker0603> HAREM ROUTE
[1:27:32] <%prime_name> They kinda did that in Pillars 2
[1:27:33] <+kekkerscrew> It's not hard to do, V just wanted to max stuff out as quick as possible
[1:27:35] <SinnerBeta> sith hussies!
[1:27:35] <Redblood801> I want the Harem
[1:27:35] <%Jetzord> Handmaiden learned from Atris
[1:27:36] <Deadbulky> If you have handmaiden go darkside they become besties
[1:27:37] <LeeOhX> HUSSY
[1:27:37] <zocano> but my team was Handmaiden and Kreia nearly the entire game so Handmaiden influence was never a problem for me
[1:27:39] <megamirk> lol
[1:27:45] <DatAsuna> DO NOT
[1:27:46] <ThePimpGuin> granny is the waifu who wins lol
[1:27:51] <%GraceTBM> this is a woman you beat in mortal combat and you can't even like, apologize

[1:44:02] <+evbites> @alphfromdk Granny: fine but i suggest you don't use crude barriers
[1:44:04] <SinnerBeta> @Zanco23 no
[1:44:11] <Redblood801> Sleep hyonosis
[1:44:11] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream

[1:44:36] <%Gruhunchously> They only see through the force
[1:44:36] <RantingRavager> HOT
[1:44:36] <Ravenian96> Literally flesh comes up eye sockets
[1:44:37] <+Kriptin> Metallica's One but Star Wars
[1:44:41] <nepwar> they hear and then they see
[1:44:43] <ggbhtg> ALSO, you live alone
[1:44:52] <+wunp_fxs> probably
[1:44:53] <%jiggy_snipe> i imagine it's like the Maiden In Black
[1:44:54] <+Testfall_V> Sockets yes, eyes no iirc
[1:44:55] <BallerSwagBro9k> Pat Ultimate Nightmare
[1:44:57] <Matermind0> That happens to me sometimes when I wake up
[1:44:59] <Redblood801> They have sockets
[1:44:59] <zanzibarian_hamster> There is concept art of it, it's...morrowindesque, if you get me.
[1:45:01] <Matermind0> It’s horrible
[1:45:01] <Daxalog> 2 extra ho- Oh...nevermind
[1:45:02] <+ZoltanBMagnus> They do have sockets
[1:45:04] <+evbites> so like a flesh dome with a nose and mouth
[1:45:10] <DatAsuna> there are sockets
[1:45:17] <megamirk> who cares, keep it covered and get in bed
[1:45:17] <%lotharrio> Sockets, but flesh covering them normally. But Visas' flesh was cut away so she has big gaping blackness there.
[1:45:19] <privatesargent> just looked it up, they DO have eye sockets
[1:45:20] <%FallenAngelZelos> They work for Yorha
[1:45:23] <DatAsuna> i'll dm you pictures
[1:45:29] <StarlitStunner> Just flat skin, sockets intact underneath. They cover up with headdress and glasses.
[1:45:40] <donstylo> Miraluka are like Pirates without the fakes eyes.
[1:45:41] <+Freeborg1997> Read the legends comic "unseen, unheard" to see Visas eye holes.
[1:45:41] <Katanas69> theres flesh but Hungry Boi cut them into sockets to torture her
[1:45:45] <NaturalGear> not sure if it's creepier with or without sockets
[1:45:50] <%Gruhunchously> Not like Oxygen, but like...I dunno, dopamine
[1:46:03] <SinnerBeta> oxygen destroyer bomb
[1:46:04] <muniea3> that's just the UK

[1:53:21] <alephalpha> I'd Imagine evrything just falls dead
[1:53:26] <zocano> or how it looks rather
[1:53:27] <Dangerzone979> Is it the same thing Vitiate does in SWTOR?
[1:53:27] <ggbhtg> wut it do chief
[1:53:33] <%lotharrio> There's a Force power that does that... you gotta assume he's doing it at a massive level.
[1:53:36] <DatAsuna> nah it's different from vitiate
[1:53:37] <Nested_Dreams> Or midichlorians deletion
[1:53:38] <ralphfromdk> You know the bullshit the Emporer does in Rise of Skywalker? Kinda like that but for a whole planet

[1:53:53] <RedSqurrl> I always imagine what like Valkorian does in SWTOR
[1:54:01] <+Greezey> sometimes they dont tell you the actual function until the end, so they can keep the mystery of it going
[1:54:03] <ThePimpGuin> Like Palpatine in the rise of Skywalker
[1:54:07] <donstylo> He summons Giant Force Mosquitos that suck the force out of people.
[1:54:09] <ggbhtg> Auswhalen from BLEACH?
[1:54:09] <RedSqurrl> EVerything just goes grey and people dissolve into dirt

[1:55:34] <Nested_Dreams> Force Invigilation
[1:55:35] <%jiggy_snipe> which is why you need to hide from him
[1:55:36] <%Gruhunchously> The Jedi were like...COME AT US BRO. And he was like, sure.
[1:55:36] <SinnerBeta> and guess WHO tipped him off? can't wait until he learns it

[1:56:03] <available_line> The abyss stared back.
[1:56:05] <%GraceTBM> woolie you're making me hungry
[1:56:06] <+Bluemanzee> Force-stuffed Turkey sounds a bit iffy
[1:56:09] <StarlitStunner> A Terducken of force
[1:56:10] <DSD24> That Boar's Head glaze on that
[1:56:12] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Kirby couldn't ignore that shit
[1:56:17] <Reizie_Etherealm> Don't forget the sides, the grilled veggies
[1:56:17] <+EleazarTheSkeleton> Keep the Force Turkey away from Alucard tho
[1:56:18] <megamirk> sniff
[1:56:21] <zocano> Darth Kirby
[1:56:21] <ggbhtg> WAFT
[1:56:21] <CaptainBright> now the question is: who opened that window
[1:56:22] <%lotharrio> Bacon wrapped, deep fried turkey
[1:56:23] <zocano> shows up
[1:56:24] <%GeneralSCPatton> They were looking at it too hard, and it came to eat them. Sounds like Hellstar Remina.
[1:56:31] <%Space_Pagan> Jedi are morons
[1:56:33] <donstylo> It's like making Lasange knowing Garfield is in the room.
[1:56:43] <%lotharrio> Like a cartoon character smelling a fresh pie and just floating right over there.
[1:56:43] <DSD24> "Whats going on in this thread?"
[1:56:48] <Augus7717> Big Genocide story = Woolie: Have you seen this turkey?
[1:56:49] <megamirk> Jedi have to be morons otherwise the game wouldn't have happened
[1:56:51] <giga_bit> Nihilus The Sith Lord Stole My Turkey
[1:56:52] <Ravenian96> Jedi genocided the Miralukan race
[1:57:00] <%jiggy_snipe> the Jedi didn;t know yet what was going on
[1:57:03] <ggbhtg> where are the Cheetooooos where's the Mountain Deeeeew?
[1:57:05] <BallerSwagBro9k> BUFFET TIME
[1:57:12] <privatesargent> can you feel emptyness Woolie
[1:57:13] <+theKingRamses> if they could feel him, they could find him
[1:57:17] <+Bluemanzee> Sounds like a good idea if you didn't know that you'd summon Force Chthulu
[1:57:17] <zocano> There's nothing to feel
[1:57:22] <ShakiraAkira> !uptime
[1:57:22] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 6 minutes
[1:57:28] <%jiggy_snipe> if they could feel him, then they could find him
[1:57:29] <%Gruhunchously> No, because they feel through the force, and he basically exists outside the force. He's a force vampire.
[1:57:30] <%siamzero94> Feeling what, the force can't escape him
[1:57:34] <privatesargent> he is a wound in the force, there is nothing for them to feel
[1:57:46] <Memdosu> He is a blackhole
[1:57:54] <%lotharrio> Maybe it's like the Tyrannids. You can't sense him coming, but from an outside point of view, you see a shadow moving through your magic senses.
[1:57:56] <available_line> Yeah, force black hole
[1:57:59] <megamirk> "something is hunting us, we better ALL gather on this planet"
[1:58:06] <alephalpha> the VORE LORD
[1:58:08] <%jiggy_snipe> if you can feel him, you're dead
[1:58:16] <Visorak6> Its probably shadow in the warp yeah

[1:59:37] <%Gruhunchously> But also, this is something the Jedi have never faced before. Ever
[1:59:42] <%gatorafan> click on "show all images" daedra1DrunkTibs
[1:59:51] <+Bluemanzee> Imagine Dragon Ball Super in OG Dragon Ball

[2:00:15] <%Gruhunchously> That's a good way of putting it
[2:00:15] <fuji_92> he's the concept of hunger basically at this point
[2:00:17] <ggbhtg> you're going to the BLAGHO
[2:00:18] <alephalpha> imagine shooting lightning at him and he just takes it in
[2:00:21] <%Yung_Booker> Anti-saiyan tech, you mean frieza
[2:00:22] <megamirk> they didn't anticipate Nihillus could access sadpanda too, in fact he was a mod
[2:00:23] <atema128> Nihilus’ mask was originally meant to be carved from Revan’s skull.
[2:00:27] <%Djinnazz> He’s Star Wars Galactus
[2:00:31] <candidateplays> Oh, and remember Kreia said that the third lord was way worse.
[2:00:38] <%lotharrio> Big if true @atema128
[2:00:44] <halfmasks> UH OH
[2:00:54] <BallerSwagBro9k> OMNONOMNOMNOMNOM
[2:00:58] <DSD24> Aren't you gathering Jedi right now?
[2:01:00] <LeeOhX> Wait any gathering of jedi?? LIKE A SHIPS WORTH???
[2:01:02] <%jiggy_snipe> HE MUST CONSOOM
[2:01:02] <ralphfromdk> The Ebon Hawk is getting real fucking juice
[2:01:04] <%Space_Pagan> Uhhhh we're having a gathering of Jedi on this here Ebon Hawk....
[2:01:05] <DSD24> Like on this ship?
[2:01:12] <%gatorafan> you know what place has a lot of Jedi right now????
[2:01:16] <%lotharrio> It's a long term recycle project
[2:01:22] <%Space_Pagan> GLAZE THE EBON HAWK
[2:01:23] <ggbhtg> a natural phenomenon?
[2:01:26] <alephalpha> yeah it's supposed to stop abraxus
[2:01:29] <ThePimpGuin> @atema128 well thats insurmountable
[2:01:29] <+Greezey> like da reapers
[2:01:29] <dereks0n> That's some Mass Effect shit
[2:01:34] <Augus7717> Cant ignore a gatherng of Jedi you say? As we make everyone a jedi on our ship.
[2:01:41] <a_mad_dragon> galactus survived the big crunch of the previous universe
[2:01:44] <alephalpha> the repaer are kinda dumber though
[2:01:45] <%siamzero94> exactly, though on your first playthrough it's not supposed to be that fast
[2:01:48] <%lotharrio> When the universe dies, Galactus dies and resets everything.
[2:01:49] <ALTRNico> ALMOST all life
[2:01:49] <%JohnAtDawn> Well I mean that's your fault woolie
[2:01:50] <donstylo> Ok next LP Mass Effect 2.
[2:01:56] <%jiggy_snipe> i think the reapers were different
[2:01:57] <+Bluemanzee> The problem with that is new life happens a lot inside a universe I'd imagine
[2:01:58] <ralphfromdk> Next playthrough confirmed??????? :O
[2:02:02] <%Gruhunchously> You guys need to play Mass Effect 2 after this
[2:02:03] <dorpork> Galactus predates Mass Effect by decades, so that would make ME some Galactus shit
[2:02:07] <akman14> ME2 confirmed?
[2:02:10] <%Space_Pagan> The Ebon Hawk is looking very tasty right now
[2:02:14] <alephalpha> so what you're saying is DARTH VORE is keeping them you don't know what you've done
[2:02:17] <BallerSwagBro9k> LP 2 AND 3
[2:02:19] <derap41> Basically they let life grow takes all that new inovation then kill all life before it can overpower them
[2:02:22] <ALTRNico> BIG BRAIN

[2:18:22] <+ghostfaceninja_> but how can two females have a child Kappa
[2:18:34] <%Alazull> Remember that the Dark Side tends to ravage your body in exchange for power...
[2:18:35] <RantingRavager> I mean, 3 is fine. If they CHOOSE to die for you, it's totally fine
[2:18:49] <%JimJamsJimJamboree> I have you and Pat's streams going at once and feel like I'm having a stroke
[2:19:01] <megamirk> she's just pragmatic

[2:20:08] <Ravenian96> TRUE
[2:20:17] <%lotharrio> I do like that Revan and Malak seemed attainable. But the Sith Lords in this one are all trash baby unique powers all over the place.
[2:20:22] <%doc_ock_rokc> No you learn by CROSSSING YOUR EYES

[2:22:06] <%lotharrio> @alephalpha I get that reference, now.
[2:22:09] <atema128> Nihilus is effectively a black hole in the shape of a man.
[2:22:09] <alephalpha> a light saber has an edge at every angle
[2:22:12] <halfmasks> Sion is a Physical Zombie, Nihilus is the Spiritual Zombie
[2:22:28] <megamirk> midichlorians are flammable?
[2:22:40] <LeeOhX> Dont you dare brings those back up

[2:23:57] <%Space_Pagan> I need more power!
[2:23:58] <Deadbulky> Vergil after eating the fruit

[2:25:25] <ALTRNico> soooo it's magic?
[2:25:30] <alephalpha> it's not really interetsing in any plot, thematic or character sense
[2:25:34] <alephalpha> but it was cool
[2:25:44] <alephalpha> yeah it's always been magic
[2:25:45] <%Space_Pagan> Space Magic

[2:34:06] <dorpork> 1 is fine
[2:34:10] <+atin2000> where she just DOES that to him
[2:34:14] <%lotharrio> I trust that you are manipulating me.
[2:34:18] <zocano> Have you been learning, Woolie
[2:34:19] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> many lies of omission
[2:34:20] <GeneralGoodrick> She's telling the truth!...From a certain point of view
[2:34:30] <%doc_ock_rokc> She is showing that her hand but all the cards are blank
[2:34:30] <nzrai> she has a side deck
[2:34:31] <mr_sups> Texas Holdem
[2:34:33] <alephalpha> well how do you know those cards are not false
[2:34:33] <dereks0n> No she doesn't, she lost that hand
[2:34:36] <Make_me_mad> Poor choice of words.
[2:34:39] <+ghostfaceninja_> a lie by omission is still a lie
[2:34:39] <ALTRNico> FOLD
[2:34:41] <SinnerBeta> "everything I say is a lie"
[2:34:44] <+Selectamo> dude this lady has some serious old lady head wobble
[2:34:45] <available_line> I love Kreia so much
[2:34:47] <fuji_92> She's lying by omission Wools
[2:34:52] <+Selectamo> kind of bums me out
[2:35:02] <subjectg> half truths are her speciality
[2:35:06] <zocano> I guess you're not learning

[2:35:31] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> a conversation between her and a certain simple tailor in Star Trek would be fun
[2:35:31] <GeneralGoodrick> Also, Disciple gets constantly memory wiped because he figures out the plot before anyone else
[2:35:32] <SinnerBeta> John likes his goth GF
[2:35:36] <Malik1002> John woke up from his nap
[2:35:37] <giga_bit> John's fingers got a little antsy

[2:36:26] <+jogproof1> I'm definitely looking forward to seeing what planet they choose
[2:36:36] <+Freeborg1997> Should start deleting those saves, or saving over, so that it stays 69
[2:36:38] <Redblood801> Very nice Caesat-chan!
[2:36:41] <%lotharrio> Saber combat!

[2:36:52] <derap41> What is the forces opinion on polygamy?
[2:37:04] <CaptainBright> no, sight is different this time
[2:37:09] <%Gruhunchously> There's some good shit coming up
[2:37:21] <usurper_sos> Get buff
[2:37:25] <+Freeborg1997> @derap41 Probably disapproves, since the force likes the Light Side
[2:37:29] <%Space_Pagan> By fight fucking?
[2:37:30] <zocano> this is a fun convo
[2:37:32] <megamirk> spinning, that's a good trick. etc, etc.

[2:38:31] <DatAsuna> gee i wonde rif it's 1. or 1.
[2:38:37] <brian_peppers1> @BallerSwagBro9k How the hell did you guess that?
[2:38:46] <giga_bit> "[Persuade] Persuasion" is great
[2:38:50] <ALTRNico> roll a d20
[2:38:51] <%lotharrio> If it's tied, you get options.
[2:38:52] <dorpork> this is actually a lesson in not reelying too much on the force
[2:38:56] <brian_peppers1> @BallerSwagBro9k That was spot on
[2:39:01] <nzrai> i like getting a lot of options for that one

[2:39:44] <alephalpha> dojn't tell anyone you leveled that
[2:39:47] <+Proxzo> We call it "Ex Pee"
[2:39:48] <Konork> One point into stealth and it's not even to use it for stealth.
[2:39:50] <alephalpha> ifinitely better
[2:39:53] <+Freeborg1997> Stealth actually makes sense as the worst skill in-lore, considering how everyone important notices the Exile.
[2:39:54] <ALTRNico> 1>0
[2:39:55] <%SirGO0SE> I didn't even see you approach!
[2:39:56] <Ravenian96> 1 is infinitely better than 0
[2:39:56] <Deadbulky> 1 is bigger than 0
[2:39:57] <+therabbles> Granny will be so proud
[2:39:57] <dereks0n> Exponentially better
[2:40:00] <ZE_Count> Your twice as good!
[2:40:07] <alephalpha> infinitely more then 0
[2:40:10] <zanzibarian_hamster> Getting 1 point in stealth means you're infinitley better, probably.
[2:40:11] <%Gruhunchously> Granny headpats
[2:40:12] <vincerocmm> didnt see yathere steath man
[2:40:13] <dereks0n> WATCH OUT ATTON
[2:40:15] <DSD24> @Zanco23 That's a good point
[2:40:16] <nzrai> granny will praise you endlessly
[2:40:17] <ThePimpGuin> infinitely better one might say
[2:40:18] <+ghostfaceninja_> 1 is a hundred percent more than 0 doodBigBrain
[2:40:24] <subjectg> actually infinitely more than 0, rational numbers yo
[2:40:37] <+mczarklesby> Granny comes through with the stealth participation ribbon.

[2:40:44] <alephalpha> remmber a manga where a pychic lose sthere powere nad then realises they forgot how to wlk
[2:40:50] <nzrai> being good with pazaak, for example
[2:40:51] <Ravenian96> But she is mad at Revan repairing droids
[2:40:54] <DSD24> Making Gunpla's is a good skill
[2:41:00] <muniea3> jedis force pushing instead of shitting
[2:41:05] <zanzibarian_hamster> Wait, is that why all your skills actually start at zero, like realistically a random joe would have some repair or persuade skill just living day to day?
[2:41:09] <dereks0n> They remind me of Quarians sorta
[2:41:12] <DatAsuna> humans dominate
[2:41:13] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> I think we can also assume Revan actually took a lotta interest in working on droids
[2:41:15] <halfmasks> JK rowling on blast
[2:41:15] <Redblood801> Kreia said playing video games is a skill DAD!
[2:41:35] <%andrei11dr> They still need houses, force or not!
[2:41:36] <ThePimpGuin> @Ravenian96 she made at him relying on droids so much
[2:41:36] <halfmasks> go away JK and your un-potty-trained wizards
[2:41:37] <ZE_Count> Your space magic!
[2:41:55] <CaptainBright> ask her again
[2:42:01] <+Bluemanzee> Imagine dying because you can't use your microwave anymore all of a sudden
[2:42:02] <subjectg> @ravenian96 more mad at their relationship with droids rather than their skill with it, i feel
[2:42:11] <+Freeborg1997> No! 70...
[2:42:14] <%cisealnine> I had to make a call, what did I miss in the last 5 minutes?

[2:42:30] <%Gruhunchously> Ask her about Atris
[2:42:31] <%siamzero94> Also Kreia can't read droids minds
[2:42:45] <%Alazull> Yo it's Twerka Industries in here making moves
[2:42:45] <Pechugaman> Ask her about Atris
[2:42:49] <+wunp_fxs> NExt planet Here we go!
[2:42:50] <zocano> might be able to ask her name
[2:42:50] <CaptainBright> Kreia has a certain dialogue about other stuff
[2:42:51] <DSD24> Oh is Handmaiden a Jedi?
[2:42:52] <available_line> I think you can also ask Kreia about the listening lesson. You forgot that.
[2:42:53] <SheefEatsBeef> u aint slick woolie
[2:42:54] <+slimmixrp> What about her name?
[2:42:57] <+wunp_fxs> oh wait mira.....

[2:44:15] <nzrai> fat one
[2:44:25] <Memdosu> She sucks
[2:44:26] <DSD24> Wow that white saber
[2:44:28] <subjectg> goto’s a shit, but he’s a good shit
[2:44:29] <zocano> ya Mira is boring
[2:44:30] <+mighty_max_t> G0-T0-SL33P
[2:44:33] <DatAsuna> She's the juhani of kotor 2
[2:44:47] <dorpork> Nah, Mira is a cool character
[2:44:50] <ALTRNico> ONE GUY
[2:44:53] <+Freeborg1997> I think Mira's cool
[2:44:59] <SinnerBeta> you ate your words about Atton though
[2:45:00] <%lotharrio> He's probably going to be annoyed at what her deal is.
[2:45:03] <fuji_92> Mira is cool tho
[2:45:04] <+wunp_fxs> oooo hot take
[2:45:05] <Goodvibes99508> agreed
[2:45:05] <DatAsuna> oof
[2:45:06] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> Mira's story does kinda involve Mando
[2:45:10] <Deadbulky> lsxyzDBB
[2:45:11] <%jiggy_snipe> well he thinks Mira is part of the harem
[2:45:14] <+Slimshazbot> Mira sucks.
[2:45:15] <+MrBaldachin> mira's alright but she's supposed to be strong and competent but she never shows it really
[2:45:15] <%bread_assassin> Woolie is going to be ashamed of his word and deed.
[2:45:17] <%andrei11dr> Mira feels like she belongs in KOTOR 1
[2:45:17] <DSD24> I think its more than that
[2:45:17] <therealslimskippy> mira's fine, not that deep just a bad first impression
[2:45:18] <Zouledge> @DatAsuna Juhani is optional at least, so that makes her better than mira imo
[2:45:20] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> Oh I know who he means, yeah that Mando girl is kinda cooler
[2:45:20] <%cisealnine> I love his voice... I mean Goto's voice... and Little V's... and occasionally Woolies.
[2:45:20] <%Alazull> No shit, there's a better version of a character written like a decade prior?
[2:45:26] <Goodvibes99508> 14 months
[2:45:26] <%SirGO0SE> thats okay :)
[2:45:33] <Deadbulky> Darkside Mira Kreygasm
[2:45:36] <usurper_sos> My DICK liked Go To

[2:45:40] <DatAsuna> @Zouledge Oh, I actualy like juhani, but she's the one everyone forgets
[2:45:42] <%Space_Pagan> Robosexual?
[2:45:42] <%Prevot> woolie hating on a character for literally no reaso
[2:45:42] <SinnerBeta> now his dick gets hard for G0T0
[2:45:45] <giga_bit> so now his dick ALSO loves goto
[2:45:49] <muniea3> your dick also liked g0t0
[2:45:49] <liljojofett> That's a good singe
[2:45:50] <+ZoltanBMagnus> your dick started to lik eGOTO
[2:45:53] <+Freeborg1997> Your dick didn't like Goto
[2:45:54] <+MrBaldachin> i'll still take mira over hanharr any day though
[2:45:55] <zocano> I don't agree with V that Goto is more interesting than Atton, but Goto is ight
[2:45:55] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> Same thing with Kreia for me, kid me didn't like her when I was like 12, but I love her now
[2:46:01] <dereks0n> To be fair, just try to forget about how she was introduced. Plot used her to advance itself, which ain't her fault
[2:46:05] <zoenzix> wooliePOYO
[2:46:06] <Klefth> Or in your fanny pack, as it were

[2:46:35] <grandark_z317> @dereks0n that's the fault of the 14 months.

[2:48:06] <megamirk> I will love you if you follow the main quest - G0T0
[2:48:16] <%cisealnine> I must point out that this game came out before YouTube existed.

[2:56:50] <RevaniteRyan> Stealth ball!
[2:56:52] <SinnerBeta> but he makes your dick hard tho?
[2:56:59] <nzrai> i don't think i've ever leveled him up
[2:57:06] <Zouledge> he's a big floating stealth bomb
[2:57:12] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> He has the final upgrade to destroy droid, dominate droid, technically
[2:57:15] <JetpackMcQuack> Its an hm slave
[2:57:22] <%siamzero94> Is that a low intelligence option from Fallout?
[2:57:24] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> instead of killing droids it makes them just yours

[3:04:18] <%RioGascar> NAH WE FOUND THE EAST INDIES
[3:04:20] <%GeneralSCPatton> ONLY EUROPE EXISTS BECAUSE JESUS LOVES US!
[3:04:21] <ThirdPersonPhil> you dont fall of the edge sillies you hit the great wall
[3:04:24] <RevaniteRyan> I THINK there’s a Yuzhan Vong were referenced in KOTOR 1
[3:04:29] <JetpackMcQuack> D:
[3:04:30] <%RioGascar> whats this new found land shit?
[3:04:30] <%lotharrio> Fucking Star Trek just jumps into the setting from the Unknown Regions.
[3:04:30] <SinnerBeta> I don't think they burned people for believing in round earth
[3:04:35] <Dangerzone979> Vong were extragalacticinvaders/refugees who decided to wage total war on the galaxy to satisfy their BDSM gods
[3:04:37] <%andrei11dr> They did knew about Asia though
[3:04:46] <+Proxzo> No one expects the Spanish Flat Earthers
[3:04:47] <RevaniteRyan> Wow, my phone butchered that sentence
[3:04:47] <DatAsuna> yeah there's a vong scout sip in one of canderous' kotor 1 stories
[3:04:50] <+Captain_Spicy_> Man T3 loves eavesdropping
[3:04:57] <DatAsuna> also the vong are the most 90s ever
[3:04:57] <Zouledge> darth t3 eavesdropping
[3:05:06] <+Freeborg1997> @RioGascar Yeah when Canderous talks about the asteroid with the ship
[3:05:11] <LeeOhX> My favourite thing about the unkown army that shows up to rock everyones shit, is that there's always the ONE person that actually knew about it all along
[3:05:13] <+SolidusRex> Lehon
[3:05:17] <DatAsuna> Rakata Prime
[3:05:18] <+SolidusRex> Also Rakata Prime
[3:05:18] <megamirk> Carth Onasi's resting place
[3:05:19] <Redblood801> Maybe I'M in charge
[3:05:27] <%Gruhunchously> It doesn't get a name in KOTOR. EU calls it Lehon
[3:05:34] <Dangerzone979> It was hidden like Kamino
[3:05:34] <+therabbles> Sith: I'm in charge :)
[3:05:35] <ralphfromdk> Yeah, there are multiple sides to the sith.... Vibroblade boy and hungry boy
[3:05:41] <%lotharrio> You could, in theory, find it just by flying around with enough people, long enough.
[3:05:43] <DatAsuna> Leon and Prime are both used
[3:05:52] <%RioGascar> So am i wrong for thinking “unknown army from edge of galaxy” is one of the laziest ass pulls in sci fi stories?
[3:05:53] <%Gruhunchously> TLJ Luke planet
[3:05:53] <DatAsuna> Kamino is also outside the galaxy btw
[3:06:06] <DatAsuna> The rishi maze is a satellite galaxy
[3:06:11] <%RioGascar> Just OH NO MASSIVE ARMY TIME FOR CONFLICTTTT
[3:06:11] <megamirk> who cares about anything from the new trilogy, lol
[3:06:13] <alephalpha> so when are we gonna talk about the silentium?
[3:06:17] <%breakdancinghobo> space is REALLY big
[3:06:23] <zocano> yo, space is big
[3:06:23] <%lotharrio> @RioGascar As long as they are different enough, it's fine. But it is really overused.
[3:06:31] <%doc_ock_rokc> Lets Talk about how Hyperspace is now instantaneous travel
[3:06:33] <+MidnightBurst12> hyperspace lanes can shift over time
[3:06:36] <akman14> No extranet
[3:06:39] <%Gruhunchously> Space is really big
[3:06:40] <ThirdPersonPhil> the internet ruin stories
[3:06:40] <DatAsuna> The holonet is inconistent
[3:06:40] <%TheOneCalledRock> star wars lore wise is all fucked up huh?
[3:06:41] <ALTRNico> no backup servers
[3:06:47] <%TheOneCalledRock> like really fucked up
[3:06:47] <alephalpha> hwo do you even commjuniactae in across light year distances
[3:06:48] <+TheFabledAble> @WoolieVersus well, maybe you cant have wifi between planets
[3:06:49] <DatAsuna> Star wars space is especially big
[3:06:50] <carlosmiyamoto> Holonet
[3:06:52] <JetpackMcQuack> Space is big
[3:06:55] <%lotharrio> I think they mention like... a "holonet" once or twice.
[3:06:59] <%doc_ock_rokc> @MidnightBurst12 Hyperspace lanes used to be controled by gravity of planets around it.
[3:07:00] <%lotharrio> But it's a nothing.
[3:07:01] <+theKingRamses> believe in the emperor
[3:07:08] <%Takreth> based T3 still making the rounds
[3:07:11] <%Prevot> space internet would be kinda hard to make
[3:07:12] <DatAsuna> Not in canon
[3:07:14] <ralphfromdk> It's hard to send data across space, hence no space internet.
[3:07:15] <DatAsuna> THat's legends only
[3:07:15] <nepwar> star wars feels like naruto where theres tech but at the same time, the main characters look to have no knowledge of it or its uses
[3:07:27] <Tucker0603> well, fuck Disney
[3:07:30] <StarlitStunner> Don’t the hutts run the holonet and not the republic?
[3:07:36] <%FallenAngelZelos> i thought that wasn't corosant?
[3:07:37] <gruulmagebeast> what is the center now cause of sewuels?
[3:07:39] <RevaniteRyan> “What is this, ‘computer’ you speak of?!”
[3:07:41] <%TheOneCalledRock> it makes me kinda glad i never got into the series when i was young because I would be losing my mind
[3:07:41] <gruulmagebeast> quels
[3:07:42] <DatAsuna> Republic Commando is a different triple 0
[3:07:45] <%TheOneCalledRock> LUL
[3:07:46] <Tucker0603> oh yeah, that dude is rad
[3:07:48] <DatAsuna> Droid triple 0 is canon
[3:07:50] <%RioGascar> the robot
[3:07:51] <%Gruhunchously> Wasn't that IG-88?
[3:07:58] <%lotharrio> Malak had no plan.
[3:08:16] <megamirk> she also had a jaw
[3:08:16] <Redblood801> Malak was the biggest idiot
[3:08:18] <megamirk> heh
[3:08:23] <alephalpha> G0-T0 is like fuck thses children
[3:08:27] <+therabbles> She wanted to fill her pocketsssssss
[3:08:31] <%doc_ock_rokc> Everyone shit talks Malak: The Game
[3:08:31] <Ravenian96> Malak smash
[3:08:31] <dorpork> this game is making fun of the fact that Malak is a saturday morning cartoon villain
[3:08:33] <+Bluemanzee> Malak was just Generic Sith™
[3:08:36] <DatAsuna> Malak's only good shit ever is in the comics
[3:08:38] <+Freeborg1997> @Gruhunchously I think he means the droid in the Disney Vader comics
[3:08:40] <RevaniteRyan> Malek: “what is that? BLOW IT UP!”
[3:08:43] <DatAsuna> and it's all before he was malak
[3:08:43] <SinnerBeta> Malak: can't I tho?
[3:08:46] <zocano> ha ha planet go boom
[3:08:52] <%Gruhunchously> Brrr Planet Destruction Machine goes Brrr

[3:14:30] <gruulmagebeast> he has that T3 aura
[3:14:33] <DatAsuna> Lose to get $150

[3:16:52] <SinnerBeta> in other words, hoes mad
[3:16:52] <CasualAlohaFriday> "Stop explaining and accept your guilt!!!"
[3:16:57] <Nested_Dreams> "Woolie is not sea lion"
[3:17:02] <gunsrlove> Soeh Dam
[3:17:18] <%RioGascar> why am i being pm’d
[3:17:19] <DatAsuna> He's not

[3:17:30] <%andrei11dr> Just don't explain and get totally shit on :)
[3:17:34] <%RioGascar> im not a kotor master
[3:17:39] <%prime_name> Youtuber apologies
[3:17:40] <Reizie_Etherealm> The desire to understand does not exist in all people
[3:17:44] <RantingRavager> hasMods Here he goes explaining why he's wrong rather than explaining guilt.
[3:18:05] <RantingRavager> sarcasm btw
[3:18:12] <+Slimshazbot> oooohh yeah
[3:18:19] <+Slimshazbot> that's a hard sell for me too
[3:18:27] <ALTRNico> not a Woolie bait
[3:18:29] <DSD24> What are they talking about? a book?
[3:18:36] <Memdosu> Always judge a book by its cover LUL
[3:18:36] <+wunp_fxs> mmm
[3:18:37] <+GrassCannon> 9/10 of their faces are eyes
[3:18:40] <RantingRavager> "Wonderful Everyday"
[3:18:47] <KuroStardust> aaaanimaaaayyy
[3:18:48] <nepwar> is this a kataka shoujo situation or is it anime weeb shit
[3:18:55] <RantingRavager> Oh no it's Anime
[3:19:00] <SinnerBeta> lot's of insight
[3:19:01] <Reizie_Etherealm> Looks about as old as Clannad and Higurashi
[3:19:05] <+Freeborg1997> Ew, anime
[3:19:06] <+MidnightBurst12> judging a book by it's color is like day 1 of "things not to do"
[3:19:08] <+wunp_fxs> oh that artstyke,,,,,'
[3:19:12] <DSD24> Oh I see it
[3:19:13] <%TheOneCalledRock> how to draw anime books
[3:19:15] <ALTRNico> just mod it so they have short hair
[3:19:17] <+SolidusRex> that's a you problem
[3:19:19] <RantingRavager> I mean, it looks fine
[3:19:21] <%TheOneCalledRock> they are not bad by default
[3:19:22] <%prime_name> YEYEYEYEYE
[3:19:23] <%TheOneCalledRock> but eh
[3:19:23] <RantingRavager> but I'm a huge weeb
[3:19:24] <%breakdancinghobo> *cough* Code Geass
[3:19:31] <TheRealSk1ll3s> its not shonen, so woolie is out
[3:19:32] <Reizie_Etherealm> It looks fine but it doesn't look great
[3:19:37] <+Freeborg1997> Let's not, and say we did...
[3:19:46] <%kyh9> @breakdancinghobo Everyone is a stick, because Clamps
[3:19:48] <Melchior_the_Wise> What show are we talking about?
[3:19:49] <DatAsuna> hope it's better than tri
[3:19:52] <snorlaxbud> Its so hype and it looks to be based on the movie for the first few episodes
[3:19:56] <%GeneralSCPatton> WHEN WAIFUMONS THO?
[3:19:58] <nepwar> you have caught my attention
[3:19:59] <%prime_name> That's Tri
[3:20:03] <Ravenian96> Digimon World remake when
[3:20:03] <+wunp_fxs> oh I have to see that
[3:20:17] <%ozzrabbit> Ok, that’s a hot recommend. I’m going to go check it out.
[3:20:18] <TheRealSk1ll3s> tri abridged was fun
[3:20:20] <%TheOneCalledRock> i like the first few episodes of tri
[3:20:22] <%prime_name> Next Order is really fun
[3:20:23] <%TheOneCalledRock> the rest is eh
[3:20:28] <ALTRNico> Cyber Sleuth Kreygasm
[3:20:29] <DSD24> Cyber Sleuth is really fun!
[3:20:34] <atema128> Wonder if they’ll do Our War Game
[3:20:39] <Dangerzone979> Is this the break?
[3:20:39] <%Gruhunchously> @WoolieVersus The only reason you need to talk to Mira is because she has interesting things to say about Hanharr.
[3:20:48] <SinnerBeta> HOT TAKE: despite all the jokes with Maiden's fuck fighting, I think Woolie would appreciate Disciples story and dialogue more
[3:21:17] <DatAsuna> absolutely
[3:21:17] <%prime_name> Yes
[3:21:20] <ralphfromdk> Wait, who is fapping into the mic? What did i miss?
[3:21:20] <ALTRNico> kinda
[3:21:23] <DSD24> No I disagree
[3:21:24] <%jiggy_snipe> yes
[3:21:26] <Memdosu> yeah pretty much
[3:21:26] <%TheOneCalledRock> i agree
[3:21:30] <+MidnightBurst12> ehh
[3:21:33] <%prime_name> Unless there is a way to toggle out of first person, then why bother?
[3:21:34] <subjectg> I disagree
[3:21:40] <DatAsuna> I like first person, but don't make character customization a thing if it is
[3:21:41] <%kyh9> No, because HOW will I self-insert if I don't get to design my action figure?!
[3:21:41] <grandark_z317> that is a waste of resources at that point.
[3:21:43] <user_naim> No, they are not wasted
[3:21:47] <%TheOneCalledRock> if it was multiplayer then that is a different story
[3:21:49] <user_naim> are you crazy?
[3:21:54] <ALTRNico> I'd rather have character creation than nothing tbh
[3:21:54] <subjectg> there’s always room for personalization
[3:22:00] <nepwar> ehh i mean you customize your face/hair IRL but you never see it unless you look at a mirror
[3:22:01] <+wunp_fxs> Mirror and menus is where youll see it
[3:22:08] <+Bluemanzee> Cyberpunk will have cutscenes. Outer Worlds had none of that
[3:22:29] <user_naim> 3rd person might be preferrable, but it being a waste is hyperbole
[3:22:30] <subjectg> look at it this way, other people will be able to see your fashion
[3:22:35] <DSD24> I want to customize my character and just having it is a plus
[3:22:36] <CasualAlohaFriday> How many games allow you to switch on the fly between first person and third person over the shoulder?
[3:22:36] <subjectg> and gaze in fear
[3:22:39] <Foopoof> Cheer10000
[3:22:40] <%Djinnazz> it's for OTHER ppl to see.
[3:22:42] <Tucker0603> reach was great cause cutscene
[3:22:44] <akman14> Metric prime?
[3:22:50] <+Slimshazbot> You may not see your Spartan much but other people do., That's most of the appeal
[3:22:52] <Dangerzone979> Why every game in 1st person doesn't model the entire body I do not know
[3:22:56] <%kyh9> in-universe
[3:23:00] <DatAsuna> well that's not in media res

[3:23:08] <ovlarigalnea> Give metroid fusion continuation
[3:23:16] <%kyh9> in-universe, not in-media-res
[3:23:21] <%jiggy_snipe> black desert but only 1st person
[3:23:22] <Reizie_Etherealm> I wish to appreciate as much as I can for the game that I play, being able to see things is one such way to maximize that.
[3:23:27] <%RioGascar> It doesnt really matter what you look like
[3:23:29] <DatAsuna> or skyrim where you have third person but it's a bad third person
[3:23:34] <+Slimshazbot> Outer Worlds having character creation was weird
[3:23:35] <RevaniteRyan> Seeing your Spartan in an assassination animation was always so satisfying
[3:23:38] <%Djinnazz> NIOH
[3:23:38] <hahyeahok> yeah true
[3:23:40] <grandark_z317> NIOH 2
[3:23:43] <akman14> What if you play in a vaccum ?
[3:23:46] <Ravenian96> Helmet toggle
[3:23:46] <+BioHunter> there a mod for helmets off
[3:23:51] <user_naim> How much of your facial details do you even see in 3rd person?
[3:23:51] <Zouledge> swtor had that option oddly enough
[3:23:52] <DSD24> Nioh 2 has amazing character customization
[3:23:52] <SinnerBeta> @WoolieVersus you can do that in swtor, if you pay lol
[3:23:53] <Tucker0603> wrong
[3:23:55] <%jiggy_snipe> no
[3:23:56] <DatAsuna> it has third person it jsut sucks
[3:23:57] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> no
[3:23:57] <ovlarigalnea> Most games have a toggle now for helmets
[3:23:57] <Tucker0603> there is 3rd person
[3:24:01] <+Slimshazbot> since Morrowind
[3:24:01] <+wunp_fxs> but the camera combat switch is a pain
[3:24:02] <%kyh9> No, you just zoom out
[3:24:03] <+BioHunter> go to the work bench to turn helmets off
[3:24:03] <user_naim> there’s a mod for that
[3:24:05] <%GraceTBM> it just controls shit in 3rd person
[3:24:05] <NaturalGear> since Moprrowind yes
[3:24:05] <Torgue_1> Morrowind
[3:24:06] <%Javaa01> All the bethesda open world games have a third person toggle
[3:24:06] <nepwar> how have we got so far in games that their isn't the option for npc to have their helmets open out of combat
[3:24:11] <DatAsuna> It's not that it lacks third person, it's that it's bad
[3:24:12] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> oh man, we know what we are adding for Woolie to play now
[3:24:13] <%lotharrio> It's just terrible for aiming.
[3:24:15] <%kyh9> Also, kill animations are third person
[3:24:15] <Psyramics> That's Overwatch skins for me
[3:24:17] <%TheOneCalledRock> yeah but playing skyrim in third person is kinda awful
[3:24:18] <ralphfromdk> But the 3rd person in Skyrim is ass and jank compared to 1st person
[3:24:23] <%Javaa01> The third person animations are absolutely garbage, but you can do that
[3:24:26] <Dangerzone979> Mass Effect did helmets being optional right, in a safe enviroment they can stay off, the second you hit an unsafe one they go on
[3:24:28] <+wunp_fxs> nah, let cyberpunk be the one exception
[3:24:33] <%GeneralSCPatton> @megalomaniacalmegalodon 500 hour morrowind LP?
[3:24:33] <%SirGO0SE> woolieGASM
[3:24:34] <%jiggy_snipe> Cyberpunk will at least show your character alot tho
[3:24:38] <ALTRNico> CLAP
[3:24:38] <%mitchteck> But third person Skyrim is ass
[3:24:41] <%andrei11dr> Iea ,Dark Souls could use that helmet feature
[3:24:50] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> @GeneralSCPatton 4 year long LP
[3:24:53] <jaygee303> How much was it?
[3:24:58] <+gkingsausagelink> I'm replaying Skyrim rn and I do combat in first person but talking and adventuring is entirely 3rd person
[3:25:04] <%GeneralSCPatton> @megalomaniacalmegalodon Delicious
[3:25:12] <%RioGascar> No one does it cause it sucks
[3:25:17] <ALTRNico> PogChamp
[3:25:30] <%lotharrio> But wait, which is it?! Are you or not?!
[3:25:35] <DatAsuna> third person needs mods to allign the positioning
[3:25:36] <%andrei11dr> I just realized that this hole session was nothing but talking LUL
[3:25:41] <Dangerzone979> But what direction is the Slash V?
[3:25:44] <Hopit> Is V's channel a recommended/suggested channel on Woolies youtubes?
[3:25:45] <DatAsuna> fallout 4 did generally improve the camera and animation
[3:25:47] <%Gruhunchously> Tole you so
[3:25:49] <+wunp_fxs> Cya then!
[3:25:53] <RantingRavager> Cya~
