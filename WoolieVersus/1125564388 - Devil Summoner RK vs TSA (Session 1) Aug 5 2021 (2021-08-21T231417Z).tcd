[0:01:27] <+NopeBadguy> what kind of air?
[0:01:30] <%livlinn> NotLikeThis
[0:01:30] <time_axis> P2 has so much text
[0:01:31] <%phd_in_thuggery> YEAH
[0:01:35] <BLARGLESNARF> Persona 2 is easily best Persona
[0:01:35] <deviljhojho_> it'll be fine 4Head
[0:01:35] <dds333a> but that too
[0:01:37] <andre11dr> P 2 ia even more jank LUL
[0:01:38] <DatAsuna> It's not LP-able
[0:01:39] <Starotter70> P2 good, but playing it is yeah...
[0:01:41] <%phd_in_thuggery> ATLUS HATES YOU LPing it
[0:01:41] <linSP> P2 featuring hitler
[0:01:43] <TonberryLives> It is pretty old LUL
[0:01:44] <DatAsuna> It's a personal time thing
[0:01:46] <superdude22> YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[0:01:47] <brachydios777> was it 1 or 2 where you fight Hitler?
[0:01:52] <andre11dr> 2
[0:01:52] <%phd_in_thuggery> just play it on your own
[0:01:52] <deviljhojho_> 2
[0:01:52] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Yeah, it's a whole can of worms
[0:01:53] <cardamomo88> P2 is kinda over the place
[0:01:53] <seer0ftime> 2
[0:01:54] <Am_Shigar00> 2
[0:01:55] <am_omega> 2 has Hilter.
[0:01:55] <BLARGLESNARF> Bad stream game. It’s 2.
[0:01:56] <TTouchdown> P2 is good, but overhyped
[0:02:00] <Zeif00> p2 is not an lp friendly game
[0:02:02] <seer0ftime> eternal punishment owns
[0:02:02] <CatRidder> P2 has all the junk
[0:02:09] <%Prevot> but... cool hitler tho
[0:02:10] <%AlteisenReiseZ> P2 is legit LP Poison
[0:02:16] <Aeroallways> still waiting for the psp fantranslation for eternal punishment
[0:02:16] <DatAsuna> It's worth playing, probably not streaming
[0:02:17] <turboyabo> i frogot where i downloaded this on either ps3 or ps4
[0:02:18] <+elderpunch> u can always do p1
[0:02:21] <dds333a> EP is the one Western dudes got before, just not PSP
[0:02:27] <CatRidder> P2 is a game you play on your own
[0:02:27] <Starotter70> Raidou is much more friendly in that regard yeah
[0:02:28] <+DarkNerdShawny> psp version of p2-1 and psx version of p2-2 is best
[0:02:30] <dds333a> And NEVER IS
[0:02:32] <Am_Shigar00> I wish you luck.
[0:02:33] <%phd_in_thuggery> it's time
[0:02:33] <+azure_rivers> Any chance for early SMT LPs ?
[0:02:34] <andre11dr> P2 has an awesome story and it's a great game, but also mega jank
[0:02:36] <ELFucilaNeroIV> the Devil Game
[0:02:37] <DatAsuna> EP is great, maybe my favourite
[0:02:39] <cardamomo88> Demon hunter boi
[0:02:39] <%shaidot> Ayy! Can't wait!
[0:02:52] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @JOJOHNNY135
[0:02:53] <+MosesUnspoken> Digital Devil Saga when tho
[0:02:53] <BLARGLESNARF> P2 is best persona, and easily worst game to lp
[0:02:55] <andre11dr> But at least P2 is better than 1 ,that game is straight trash
[0:02:55] <juicysal> the gameplay is pretty lackluster. you got stinger and that's about ut
[0:02:56] <am_omega> I think people overstate the jank in P2.
[0:02:56] <dds333a> Comparable to Onimusha Kappa
[0:02:58] <TTouchdown> Raidou 1 can go quick if you’re not a completionist
[0:02:59] <RaiNiMayonnaise> Raidou is a good one to do
[0:03:01] <critiquequartz> Yay!
[0:03:02] <AThing_> This game thankfully isn't too jank
[0:03:03] <@Solidus_113> back to the era of "so I was grinding off stream"
[0:03:04] <alexandrecau> Would you call this retro gaming?
[0:03:05] <am_omega> IS is super easy.
[0:03:08] <deviljhojho_> raidou is such a badass in every game he appears
[0:03:11] <%justmildlilac> Raidou is so good
[0:03:11] <seer0ftime> raidou's a blast i love it
[0:03:11] <prime_name> #TMS
[0:03:13] <TTouchdown> 2 is chunky tho
[0:03:16] <%LurkerKraid> TMS
[0:03:16] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:03:17] <VJdarkworld> Atlus monkaS
[0:03:18] <dds333a> Atlus sniped it
[0:03:18] <prime_name> Never forget the #1300
[0:03:19] <%Prevot> no one tell Atlus about this
[0:03:22] <%mr_sups> Like Disco
[0:03:27] <VJdarkworld> NO NARCS
[0:03:27] <clumsydemiurge> raidou 1's good but raidou 2 is one of the best of all time
[0:03:28] <dds333a> Not even close
[0:03:31] <+elderpunch> rip persona 5 NotLikeThis
[0:03:32] <DatAsuna> woulda been even longer than TMS
[0:03:34] <Zeif00> I assume they will utilize the PS2's "HD Button"
[0:03:35] <+xenaurelio> xenaurelio subscribed with Prime. 
[0:03:36] <AThing_> This game max is like 35 hours if you do everything
[0:03:37] <Dogking16> Do digital devil saga
[0:03:41] <Am_Shigar00> Raidou 1 is rough in my opinion, but Raidou 2 feels great.
[0:03:42] <%mr_sups> #1300
[0:03:42] <linSP> woolie let me hook you up with my translated SMT 1 snes cart
[0:03:43] <time_axis> both 1 and 2 have their pros and cons
[0:03:49] <%phd_in_thuggery> @WoolieVersus That look at P5 CONVINCED me to buy the game, I now regret buying and playing P5
[0:03:49] <CatRidder> only 100 hours
[0:03:50] <andre11dr> It's still like 25 hours
[0:03:51] <DatAsuna> @AThing_ so a 70 hour LP, gotcha :P
[0:03:51] <turboyabo> the devil summoner series is short and simple cut and go story good
[0:03:55] <dds333a> @dogking16 I wish, but it seems like he's played them on his own time

[0:06:20] <AThing_> it's not unless you really really really go slow
[0:06:20] <+Lavrohas> check that how long to beat
[0:06:20] <Dogking16> Raido isn't 50+
[0:06:21] <Starotter70> It's relatively short
[0:06:22] <RaiNiMayonnaise> Its not
[0:06:22] <%mr_sups> @pantypan I was trying to re-up my own sub but gifted one accidentally. But y'know, is cool.
[0:06:23] <time_axis> it can be if you do optional shit, but it's not worth it in this case
[0:06:24] <%deadredeyez> this is hype af
[0:06:25] <+Diabetic> It's about....15 at most
[0:06:25] <+RigmaroleHM> 70+ hours instead
[0:06:31] <andre11dr> It's like 30
[0:06:32] <Am_Shigar00> at worst it's like 40 assuming you try to find/do everything
[0:06:32] <BLARGLESNARF> It’s like 25-30
[0:06:33] <+cubbywolf> 80 hours
[0:06:33] <cardamomo88> 100+
[0:06:34] <%SirGO0SE> 20 minuts :)
[0:06:35] <turboyabo> 30 hours at best if you dont go looking for side quest

[0:06:36] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Woolie Lag tm
[0:06:36] <+ReallyBigRocks> Add 20%
[0:06:37] <%Fabpsi_> is woolie lag a fixed number?
[0:06:38] <%pantypan> @mr_sups lol
[0:06:38] <RaiNiMayonnaise> I beat it in around 30
[0:06:39] <brunoberserk> woolie's S P E E D
[0:06:39] <AThing_> Raidou 2 could MAYBE be 50+ hours but not 1
[0:06:39] <dds333a> Also, ShmupGod Pat is different from "regular Pat"
[0:06:39] <%mr_sups> What is the Woolie Lag vairable?
[0:06:39] <%Gogogolem> 1000 hours.
[0:06:40] <%jinking79> ok so 3 months
[0:06:41] <Jboogy14> It’s like 20-24 hours according to How to Long to beat.

[0:06:50] <+RigmaroleHM> Any idea how many Disco was?
[0:06:51] <TTouchdown> Raidou and DDS duologies have baller openings.
[0:06:51] <T_Sasquatch> howlongtobeat + woolie lag = profit ?
[0:06:52] <DatAsuna> Woolie lag is just using the completionist time on HLTB
[0:06:52] <brachydios777> SMT popularity got a bit bigger I think thanks to word of mouth of SMT 3 and later Persona
[0:06:53] <%phd_in_thuggery> WR 10 minute
[0:06:53] <%isa_sensei96> hmmm, we'll see.
[0:06:55] <ELFucilaNeroIV> How much variable is Woolie Lag?
[0:06:56] <TTouchdown> Nah, Raidou 1 goes quick if you ain’t trying to complete the compendium
[0:06:57] <Am_Shigar00> That was around how long it took me to beat it, and I didn't do the superbosses.

[0:07:29] <+shoryukenabotch> WOOLAG SWITCH VoteYea
[0:07:30] <+TheotherKristian> remembrer to add 10% in woolie play time
[0:07:32] <+RD_NX> psaGib
[0:07:33] <%elderpunch> woolieSMUG
[0:07:34] <andre11dr> It's definitely not as a long as the sequel, that's like 70
[0:07:35] <+Lavrohas> how many vods does 40 hours translate into, i can never gauge that
[0:07:37] <RaiNiMayonnaise> Best part about Raido is that you don't need to grind too mucn
[0:07:42] <Dogking16> I was introduced to SMT last year and within 10 months I beat P5R twice, beat DDS 1, and beat Nocturne remastered. I'm burned out on this series.
[0:07:44] <+Lavrohas> *youtube vods
[0:07:46] <AThing_> Raidou 2 does have a lot of side shit ye
[0:07:54] <%SirGO0SE> good math psaUp
[0:07:55] <Am_Shigar00> Raidou also has a dedicated grinding area if you really need it.
[0:07:58] <%starrich55> @deadredeyez woolieSMUG
[0:08:00] <AThing_> Can I play raidou on this computer?
[0:08:01] <dds333a> For example, like most RPG's, NPC's have tons of dialogues and subplots between chapters, so that adds, but it's all optional
[0:08:02] <%elderpunch> @dogking16 now play devil survivor
[0:08:02] <+Diabetic> wait is this Raidou 1?
[0:08:02] <@Solidus_113> free 500gb ssd with your build
[0:08:08] <%elderpunch> woolieSMUG
[0:08:11] <andre11dr> Also they will spend some time READING THE DIALOGUE
[0:08:12] <BLARGLESNARF> No, it just on ps2/3
[0:08:13] <AThing_> @Diabetic  yep
[0:08:14] <xeros720> souless army is 1 i'm pretty sure yeah
[0:08:14] <Blank9> There can be an adjustment with Raidou for sure.
[0:08:15] <DatAsuna> nice
[0:08:17] <basedfresh> damn I just sold this game
[0:08:18] <Zeif00> PogChamp
[0:08:18] <dds333a> @diabetic sure is
[0:08:20] <cardamomo88> Noice
[0:08:20] <+ReallyBigRocks> that's pretty spicy
[0:08:20] <Blank9> and yeah it's 1
[0:08:21] <+xpakeo> thats a good
[0:08:21] <%meatman_noplan> Thats pretty cool tbh
[0:08:24] <+ManOfReason> FREE PogChamp
[0:08:24] <brachydios777> How high does this game rank for SMT fans?
[0:08:25] <AThing_> There is no voice acting so yeah they are going to have to read
[0:08:27] <%shaidot> SSD? Wow
[0:08:28] <Am_Shigar00> damn, I just got my new PC a few months ago
[0:08:29] <%elderpunch> i just got my pc from them woolieGASM
[0:08:30] <%phd_in_thuggery> that's a decent deal
[0:08:33] <Teyaric> The best part of this advertisement - Reggie's genuine double layer eyebrow raise there.
[0:08:36] <Iam_Dead> YOOOOO raidou? had to hop off the disco train early for spoilers. but I'm hyped for this.
[0:08:41] <+Diabetic> I love the ending of this game
[0:08:41] <+ReallyBigRocks> that's like $100-ish free
[0:08:42] <Blank9> this game's great but clunky, 2 is the huge gameplay improvement but story's not as good
[0:08:42] <Dogking16> @elderpunch That requires a 3DS
[0:08:43] <AThing_> @brachydios777  This one doesn't rank super high but 2 is my favorite SMT game
[0:08:45] <+Neoripo> Solid State Deal
[0:08:45] <dds333a> Also, the dialogue in english is hilarious LUL LUL
[0:08:46] <%KetsuoTaberu> if you're in the market for an ABSOLUTE-UNIT Kappa
[0:08:48] <am_omega> @brachydios777 The first one is messy but has heart. the sequel feels better.
[0:08:58] <BLARGLESNARF> @brachydios777 good above average but yeh
[0:09:02] <andre11dr> Is there dialogue?
[0:09:04] <xeros720> raidou 1 has a lot of rough edges, but i really remember it fondly
[0:09:08] <AThing_> There's a ton of dialogue
[0:09:14] <dds333a> @andre11dr only demons actually speak
[0:09:17] <BLARGLESNARF> No, this game has no dialogue.
[0:09:17] <Am_Shigar00> gameplay is really the only major issue I had with this game. The dialogue and presentation is top notch
[0:09:17] <T_Sasquatch> whens reggie solo stream ??

[0:14:22] <%Afterman_> yeaah
[0:14:23] <+haitakaa> snes
[0:14:26] <cardamomo88> LUL LUL
[0:14:27] <Dogking16> Like, wrong from the first sentence
[0:14:27] <%Afterman_> first 10 words, 9 of them are WRONG
[0:14:28] <%Prevot> I thought it started on snes
[0:14:29] <+Diabetic> A whole lot of spin offs, and ALL of them take a LONG time to beat
[0:14:34] <am_omega> bruh did not even talk about the edgy ass book that started it all.
[0:14:36] <linSP> CLOSE ENOUGH
[0:14:37] <zanzibarian_hamster> SMT is OOOLD
[0:14:39] <%isa_sensei96> @andre11dr nope, only SMT 4
[0:14:40] <+MosesUnspoken> PLAY DEVIL SURVIVOR
[0:14:41] <dds333a> Yeah Megami Tensei was '87
[0:14:41] <Aeroallways> they never got translated until like a couple spinoffs in the late 90's even thought the franchise has existed since the early 80's
[0:14:41] <teefpal> First Megami Tensei was NES, first SMT was SNES
[0:14:42] <+FuqBoiSlim> Frame 1 Falsification
[0:14:43] <Applecannon63> There was even a shin megami tensei Online
[0:14:45] <%phd_in_thuggery> that Doomed Megapolis up in the right corner
[0:14:51] <Starotter70> Devil Survivor
[0:14:52] <brachydios777> What does SMT mean in english?
[0:14:54] <alrobot2014> Devil Survivor
[0:14:54] <BLARGLESNARF> Devil Survivor 2: RB is one of my top 10 gaems
[0:14:55] <+Diabetic> SMT If..was persona 0 basically during the SNES era
[0:14:57] <Lightraven_> Nocturne is not a spin off
[0:14:57] <%Prevot> pour one out for Devil Survivor
[0:14:57] <ndcoten> how could you not offer Devil Kids as an example?!
[0:14:57] <arkv01> megaten was originally devil summoner via floppies
[0:14:58] <thetruenicster> its already on Switch
[0:14:58] <teefpal> They were originally books
[0:14:58] <%TubeMan642> Demi Kids
[0:15:00] <zeow31> Nocturne is mainline Woolie LUL
[0:15:00] <Dogking16> Persona is actually also popular because its the only spin off that every game has been released in America
[0:15:00] <dds333a> @applecannon63 Imagine was neat
[0:15:02] <+Shad8snake> Nocturne is 3
[0:15:06] <Tracazoid> Nocturne is SMT3
[0:15:06] <thetruenicster> and Nocturne is not a spinoff
[0:15:07] <SoaringTrumpet> are there any good Degrassi games Kapppa
[0:15:07] <+haitakaa> strange journey
[0:15:07] <$MonsterEnvy> Nocturne is a mainline game
[0:15:08] <Teyaric> Nocturn is SMT 3  core title - It's  subtitle
[0:15:08] <Am_Shigar00> Technically first MT was an arcade game, but that's a whoooole other branch
[0:15:08] <+DarkNerdShawny> Nocturne is SMT3
[0:15:09] <Qu1ckyyy> Nocturne is mainlime
[0:15:11] <+Diabetic> @brachydios777 like rebirth of the goddess or something?
[0:15:11] <BLARGLESNARF> @brachydios777 True Goddess Revival
[0:15:12] <AThing_> @brachydios777  True/New Goddess Resurrection
[0:15:13] <DatAsuna> Well not all

[0:15:14] <am_omega> @brachydios777 True Reincarnation of the Goddess
[0:15:14] <Darren716> Woolie you forgot about Jack Bros for the Virtual Boy
[0:15:14] <Joestar1890> Except for Jack Bros BibleThump
[0:15:15] <%phd_in_thuggery> @Diabetic New Demon Story
[0:15:17] <+MisterAJ1993> @brachydios777 True Goddess Reincarnation I think.
[0:15:19] <ranarath> @brachydios777  True goddess resurrection
[0:15:19] <Applecannon63> @brachydios777 Godesd Revival
[0:15:27] <+tentavision> nocturne is 3
[0:15:28] <%shaidot> don't worry too much about it guys
[0:15:30] <RoboticRexkek> psaWrong
[0:15:35] <dds333a> There's also Megami Genei
[0:15:43] <dds333a> and megami ibunroku
[0:15:44] <cardamomo88> forget about jack bros will never come back NotLikeThis
[0:15:45] <zanzibarian_hamster> It's crazy that the series is called SMT when the actual first game is MT, it's like  if all street fighers just became super street fighter at a point
[0:15:46] <andre11dr> Oh shit which one was the space one ,i played that one too ,but I'm just forgetting the name
[0:15:46] <%phd_in_thuggery> WHEN DO WE GET TO BIBLE STORY?
[0:15:47] <+Kharinite> Nocturne is 3, a mainline game
[0:15:48] <%mr_sups> TvTropes calls that Colon: Cancer::::
[0:15:51] <+DarkNerdShawny> Nocturne is mainline, is smt3
[0:15:51] <$MonsterEnvy> Woolie Nocturne is a mainline game 3.
[0:15:52] <+Neoripo> It's a multiverse
[0:15:54] <andre11dr> It's wasn't If
[0:15:54] <Am_Shigar00> and then they did idols once, but people don't like to talk about that.
[0:15:57] <+Burdenslo> SMT Lucifers Call is the sickest name
[0:15:59] <ranarath> Don’t forget Majin Tensei. :P
[0:16:01] <Man_in_the_Red> between devil summoner games every kuzonoha are badasses
[0:16:04] <%Darmanimon> Don't forget Synchronocity!
[0:16:04] <%shaidot> THE GREAT WILL
[0:16:06] <Darren716> It's still nuts to me that AVGN technically reviewed an SMT game
[0:16:06] <%Exiliator> Playing devil games again?!
[0:16:07] <+xpakeo> dont correct them guys, consume content and anticipate arrival of more :)
[0:16:10] <+Dova573> is about attacking and dethroing god
[0:16:11] <BLARGLESNARF> SMTNine is most important
[0:16:11] <%elderpunch> dont forget Ronde
[0:16:13] <RoboticRexkek> Pokedemon
[0:16:15] <sirthomas2step> Butt Rock Demon Pokemon
[0:16:16] <%Prevot> DON'T FORGET DEMIKIDS LUL
[0:16:17] <dds333a> demons through the medium of compute programming
[0:16:18] <cardamomo88> pokemons the rob you
[0:16:18] <Am_Shigar00> @Darmanimon Jack Bros?
[0:16:20] <AThing_> this game should explain its self pretty well
[0:16:21] <xeros720> and this is the action rpg spinoff! lets go!
[0:16:23] <zeow31> "Using them like Pokemon" when it started before pokemon smh LUL
[0:16:23] <%townzzzzz> on your computer arm
[0:16:23] <BlackermanZX> Demon Pokemons
[0:16:24] <zanzibarian_hamster> somethign something gnosticism sort of
[0:16:24] <Joestar1890> @dds333a tbf Megami Ibunroku was used to introduce new subseries like Devil Summoner and Persona
[0:16:25] <SoaringTrumpet> what a game summary lol
[0:16:29] <teefpal> Originally it was just PCs
[0:16:29] <alexandrecau> basically digimon
[0:16:30] <Applecannon63> Use pokemon to dethrone god
[0:16:32] <am_omega> "phone" lol nah it was a fuckin computer.
[0:16:32] <Starotter70> Law VS Chaos is usually a big conflict
[0:16:33] <%mr_sups> DIGITAL Devil Saga
[0:16:33] <%isa_sensei96> COMP
[0:16:34] <+MashinChaserR> gotta love your comp
[0:16:35] <redginger666> Woolie IS playing devil games
[0:16:36] <%Darmanimon> @Am_Shigar00 nah the PC one
[0:16:38] <RoboticRexkek> force the demon to work for YOU
[0:16:39] <andre11dr> STRANGE JOURNEY, i remembered the name
[0:16:39] <Joestar1890> COMP
[0:16:41] <%phd_in_thuggery> Stephen standing up is the scariest shit
[0:16:41] <+JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> because computers are real similar to traditional demon summoning FOR SOME REASON
[0:16:43] <ndcoten> also, in VERY rough terms, "demon" = "famous figure of myth or fable from around the world"
[0:16:45] <$MonsterEnvy> Law and Chaos also tends to be a big theme.
[0:16:45] <am_omega> Chugging around a 90s PC baybe
[0:16:45] <Joestar1890> ACTUALLY COMP
[0:16:45] <brachydios777> Fight God or God is dead depending on the game
[0:16:46] <andre11dr> That's a great ine
[0:16:46] <stantheman_97> we doing devil games again
[0:16:47] <BLARGLESNARF> That’s some Megami Tensei stuff ayyyy
[0:16:48] <cardamomo88> Wich one ?
[0:16:49] <linSP> just use your computer to summon satan
[0:16:49] <Am_Shigar00> @Darmanimon Interesting, I have to look that up
[0:16:49] <teefpal> The whole series originated pre-portable computer
[0:16:50] <+ManOfReason> how convenient
[0:16:50] <%Prevot> YHVH gotta go
[0:16:51] <BlackermanZX> Theres always a god to kill in SMT games
[0:16:53] <Vyneci> ATTACK AND DETHRONE
[0:16:55] <dds333a> @joestar1890 that's what I'm referring to, I wasn't trying to make it confusing
[0:16:56] <mortificent> ATTACK AND DETHRONE
[0:16:56] <JOJOHNNY135> If Atlus remastered Jack Bros I’d buy it, I want Jack Bros man
[0:16:56] <+Neoripo> Also Stephen Hawkin
[0:16:56] <Dogking16> There's actually a spin off that's a pokemon clone. it even has two versions
[0:16:58] <teefpal> Pre-laptop,even
[0:17:00] <critiquequartz> Pls go watch marsh’s vids
[0:17:00] <BimboBagging> grandma Woolie noooo
[0:17:01] <andre11dr> Well that's just 2 and 4
[0:17:04] <cipher758> stephen op
[0:17:05] <%TitaniumDragoonNeo> @zanzibarian_hamster Moreso that SMT is a reboot of the franchise that was killed after Atlus's license of the Megami Tensei property expired. MT was originally a successful novel(s) that Atlus made a game based on. Like Square and Parasite Eve.
[0:17:05] <Shad0wTag> demom=myth
[0:17:05] <cardamomo88> Demons WANT MONEY
[0:17:05] <critiquequartz> They’re pretty funn
[0:17:06] <chickenhunter> Chemtrails is a demon
[0:17:09] <andre11dr> And P5 kinda
[0:17:12] <dds333a> Not ALL games involve killing God, but most do
[0:17:13] <+tentavision> guy created a demon summoning app to kill his bullies
[0:17:14] <DianaTheAscian> Isn't Hitler in one of these games?
[0:17:15] <+LandOfTheWay> god as in the abrahamic one, literally named YHVH
[0:17:17] <%Gogogolem> Currently setting at 60% accuracy.
[0:17:19] <+MashinChaserR> all gods are canon
[0:17:19] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:17:19] <+Volttreb> Chainsaw Man rules
[0:17:23] <zeow31> Oh oh, someone messed up and explained SMT 4 lore to woolie LUL
[0:17:27] <BLARGLESNARF> Hitler is in Persona 2
[0:17:28] <+LandOfTheWay> @dianatheascian that's persona 2
[0:17:30] <%mr_sups> Imps are not that powerful, but Odin is STRONK
[0:17:31] <andre11dr> @dianatheascian That's P2
[0:17:31] <ranarath> @dianatheascian That’s Persona 2
[0:17:32] <Am_Shigar00> @TitaniumDragoonNeo I don't know if it's true, but I heard the original author has actually played some of the later games and likes them
[0:17:33] <xeros720> oh it's fine
[0:17:35] <%Prevot> turns out every religion was right but also wrong
[0:17:35] <dds333a> Also, Akemi Nalajima did it first Kappa
[0:17:36] <DianaTheAscian> K
[0:17:38] <+Exicuren> Yes, kill god, no any god, but THE GOD
[0:17:39] <%Darmanimon> @DianaTheAscian in SMT 2 as the Dictator
[0:17:39] <zanzibarian_hamster> or Forgotten realms rules
[0:17:39] <%shaidot> SMT IV lore is really cool tho tbf
[0:17:41] <xeros720> as far as a guideline it's decent to start
[0:17:45] <dds333a> *Nakajima
[0:17:45] <Aeroallways> gotta remember the fact this franchise predates the pokemon games btw
[0:17:47] <cardamomo88> Lucifer is CHAD
[0:17:48] <am_omega> @DianaTheAscian In Persona 2, and that is because Rumours are becoming reality and a Alex Jones like is spoutin some shit.
[0:17:48] <%Darmanimon> he wears shades
[0:17:50] <Joestar1890> More or less
[0:17:51] <AThing_> that's about 60% accurate yes
[0:17:52] <Iam_Dead> let's go mothman
[0:17:55] <teefpal> Also God is the main Villian
[0:17:57] <$MonsterEnvy> Law and Chaos is a big theme as well.
[0:17:57] <+MosesUnspoken> Attack and Dethrone GOD
[0:17:58] <zeow31> @shaidot As long as we don't count apocalypse, sure
[0:18:00] <Applecannon63> @blarglesnarf nah his name is Fuhrer not that hitler person  Kappa
[0:18:00] <BLARGLESNARF> Just let them eat you a little then they join you
[0:18:02] <seylumie> always punch god
[0:18:04] <+Atomic_Blowfish> where are my mf chaos boys at
[0:18:04] <%Gogogolem> Those are fan theories.
[0:18:07] <andre11dr> Also Strange Journey
[0:18:08] <dds333a> @am_omega a LOT of people in fact
[0:18:08] <+Kharinite> Don't forget about jack frost heehoo
[0:18:10] <sirthomas2step> Nocturne and DDS are connected
[0:18:10] <AThing_> the connections are very very loose don't worry about them
[0:18:11] <%TitaniumDragoonNeo> @Am_Shigar00 It wouldn't surprise me. It was mainly a legal issue why Shin exists, rather than bad blood, iirc.
[0:18:12] <+azure_rivers> Multiverse connections
[0:18:12] <andre11dr> And If
[0:18:13] <%phd_in_thuggery> most charts are fan theories
[0:18:17] <cardamomo88> DONT BRING THE CHART
[0:18:17] <Man_in_the_Red> theres an Imgur timeline, and its more like a timetumboeweed
[0:18:17] <time_axis> a lot of that stuff is fan theory
[0:18:18] <$MonsterEnvy> @shaidot Apocaylpse was super cool.
[0:18:18] <BLARGLESNARF> @applecannon63 True, Hitler never wore aviators
[0:18:19] <+LandOfTheWay> SMT if... leads into persona
[0:18:21] <robobeau> KILL ALL GODS
[0:18:23] <Qu1ckyyy> what?
[0:18:24] <%Afterman_> what becomes the next god
[0:18:25] <xeros720> yeah, those atlus guys are pretty consistent about rules in their series
[0:18:25] <Aeroallways> not accurate
[0:18:26] <linSP> punch god and Lucifer, destroy everything
[0:18:26] <%elderpunch> just watch Larrue on this stuff
[0:18:27] <turboyabo> that is super not accruate
[0:18:28] <AThing_> Chart checking will ruin the let's play!
[0:18:28] <Iam_Dead> the DS smt games are the best entry points.
[0:18:29] <Man_in_the_Red> tumbleweed
[0:18:29] <Darren716> THAT'S WRONG
[0:18:31] <+tentavision> i think there's a multiverse element
[0:18:33] <DianaTheAscian> very wrong
[0:18:37] <+LandOfTheWay> not even remotely accutate lol
[0:18:38] <RaiNiMayonnaise> Most of these fan theories are incorrect
[0:18:39] <andre11dr> I think that's wrong
[0:18:40] <JOJOHNNY135> That’s extremely off
[0:18:42] <Joestar1890> Very wrong LUL
[0:18:42] <teefpal> No you were lied to
[0:18:43] <am_omega> That is super wrong.
[0:18:43] <Tracazoid> Pretty wrong
[0:18:43] <%Afterman_> EVEN IF ITS WRONG IT SOUNDS COOL AS FUCK. MAKE THAT GAME WOOLIE
[0:18:44] <Am_Shigar00> The original Devil Summoners are explicitly noted as being an AU to the original SMT.
[0:18:45] <DianaTheAscian> even I know that
[0:18:45] <AThing_> that's sounds like some weird fan theory
[0:18:46] <cardamomo88> LUL LUL kinda??
[0:18:46] <%Prevot> Persona is like what if Hitler wore super cool sunglasses
[0:18:47] <+agumon9000> There is a multiverse
[0:18:47] <Shad0wTag> multivese wookie
[0:18:48] <zeow31> @shaidot Apocalypse is what happens when a persona writer ends up writing for mainline SMT LUL
[0:18:48] <%jinking79> different spin off
[0:18:49] <+MosesUnspoken> Woolie LUL
[0:18:51] <+MisterAJ1993> THAT IS HELLA INCORRECT
[0:18:52] <brachydios777> Hinduism would probably get really strong
[0:18:54] <Shad0wTag> woolie
[0:18:54] <ranarath> Devil Summoner is canon to Persona.
[0:18:55] <deviljhojho_> why would pat lie like that
[0:18:56] <dds333a> @sirthomas2step not necessarily, it could literally just be an easter egg
[0:18:56] <DatAsuna> The Amala Network @w@
[0:18:56] <andre11dr> Persona is an If sequel right?
[0:18:57] <+Foxfire710> It’s kinda right
[0:18:57] <cipher758> just a multiverse
[0:18:58] <mortificent> Persona is what if the world wasn't nuked to hell
[0:18:59] <%KetsuoTaberu> I don't know if it's wrong or not but everyone's saying it's wrong so it's wrong
[0:19:02] <reonome> ITS ALL CANON
[0:19:04] <%moonmintparadise> Yeah killing Gods is a thing. Nocturnes Boss Music literaly says: "One more God rejected" because that is what you do.
[0:19:04] <+Kinggarbage> Think zelda timeline
[0:19:04] <Joestar1890> Yeah, SMT thrives off of Multiverse theory
[0:19:05] <Dakuu75> but... what time until penis-monster?
[0:19:05] <+LandOfTheWay> @andre11dr yes
[0:19:05] <+Atomic_Blowfish> NotLikeThis
[0:19:07] <%dmcRedgrave> Woolie don't worry. You're going to be wrong no matter what because the games themselves don't really care.
[0:19:08] <BLARGLESNARF> Case by case
[0:19:08] <teefpal> Law and Chaos, both are bad
[0:19:10] <%Gogogolem> Some games you're rebirthing the world.
[0:19:12] <dds333a> The Amala Network just became a shorthand
[0:19:13] <auraoftheearth009> I think persona is igor and another god made a deal that humanity had to prove it's worth or that might just be 5
[0:19:14] <AThing_> This game says fuck off all to that
[0:19:15] <Aeroallways> Persona is just the one timeline where the world doesn't literally go into grand apocalypse mode
[0:19:16] <xeros720> we are in the SPINOFF DIMENSION
[0:19:16] <BLARGLESNARF> Neutral are cowards
[0:19:20] <%Fabpsi_> you are just an insect pokemon trainer
[0:19:21] <+tentavision> woolie stole crazy talk???
[0:19:21] <Zeif00> SMT is just "Everybody Sucks"
[0:19:23] <SomeGuy187> Chemtrail is a demon you can get in SMT 4
[0:19:24] <+mechslayer71> @zeow31 hate to break it to ya, persona is mainline now
[0:19:24] <%Afterman_> lets make woolies fic a reality
[0:19:26] <BlackermanZX> i think theres no Mara in Devil Summoner 1
[0:19:26] <%Dopamien> persona: what if we lived in the hornyverse
[0:19:27] <%TitaniumDragoonNeo> Woolie is woolieONEGUY
[0:19:27] <Joestar1890> Earliest SMT game chronologically I believe
[0:19:27] <Starotter70> LUL
[0:19:27] <cardamomo88> C H A O S
[0:19:29] <AThing_> Here we just do cool demon detective shit
[0:19:29] <+mechslayer71> Kappa Kappa Kappa
[0:19:30] <andre11dr> It's a little part of that
[0:19:31] <Man_in_the_Red> @blarglesnarf cowards that get the most content
[0:19:33] <+DarkNerdShawny> woolie is 60% accurate LUL
[0:19:34] <mortificent> Devil Summoner is actually in the same timeline as Persona, iirc
[0:19:35] <turboyabo> like persona stop carring about that concept the moment we got three
[0:19:35] <%Afterman_> LETS BELIEVE IN WOOLIES WORDS until they BECOME REAL
[0:19:36] <%Gogogolem> Woolie has hit the promised 40% accuracy.
[0:19:36] <Teyaric> This is all true. This is all false. Depending on the game, the kalpa, the timeline, and so on. The series itself IS all over the place
[0:19:40] <%Dopamien> Persona was made by the coomer team
[0:19:41] <dds333a> @auraoftheearth009 that comes up in P2 as well, through Philemon, Igor's master
[0:19:43] <Blank9> CLOSE ENOUGH, B-
[0:19:43] <Tracazoid> You're going into multiverse territory Woolie, might as well just start throwing Fate lore in there and Reggie will be none the wiser.
[0:19:44] <robobeau> Persona games = Pre Apocalypse  SMT games = During or Post Apocalypse
[0:19:44] <%ViewtifulYoshi> It doesn’t really matter. Each game does its own thing. You’re good, Wookiee.
[0:19:45] <%moonmintparadise> SMT main series is usually about the Apocalypse in which God died and one of the big bads tries to take over
[0:19:45] <+LandOfTheWay> TEAM CHAOS REPRESENT
[0:19:45] <+MosesUnspoken> This stream is the start of the Woolie religion.
[0:19:45] <+JFrostyBeats> isn't devil summoner a spin off one in a world were the nuked didn't go off.
[0:19:46] <%fearlesscoward9> Oh shit we doing SMT now?
[0:19:47] <%Fabpsi_> it sounds solid, can't wait for the gameplay^^
[0:19:47] <BLARGLESNARF> @man_in_the_red Nocturne says no
[0:19:50] <am_omega> Woolie trying to P2 this.
[0:19:55] <cardamomo88> you're right but also wrong
[0:19:57] <linSP> middle of the road is fuck everyone, better than the moralist neutrality
[0:20:00] <dds333a> yup
[0:20:03] <andre11dr> This one doesn't deal with the Law and Chaos shit ,the sequel gose more into that stuff
[0:20:07] <teefpal> Is there any game where Chaos is the best option?
[0:20:08] <Joestar1890> Yeah, kinda
[0:20:08] <time_axis> that's correct, sorta

[0:26:55] <Leddy_at_Home> Meguro outside of Persona AKA Meguro without LIMITS
[0:27:00] <%justmildlilac> Remember the basics of CQC
[0:27:03] <Am_Shigar00> Magnetite isn't too bad in this game, though a bit pointless in the long run
[0:27:04] <Starotter70> @LandOfTheWay psaGib
[0:27:07] <sirthomas2step> Press r1 to aim cancel
[0:27:08] <tyrizzlerone> Trying to get this in the UK is PAIN
[0:27:10] <Joestar1890> @DianaTheAscian Imagine devil may cry 1 without the juggling and you only use Rebellion, that's Raidou 1 LUL At least Demon and elemental bullet mechanics help
[0:27:11] <Applecannon63> learn the basics of CQC

[0:28:22] <%isa_sensei96> World of STR
[0:28:22] <%elderpunch> we need platinum to remake this game
[0:28:23] <Am_Shigar00> Magic stat increases magic defense.
[0:28:30] <$Superdandy96> If there’s a dimensional cut later on, I’m gonna N U T
[0:28:32] <andre11dr> Str is the broken one right?
[0:28:33] <Joestar1890> @am_omega He has something better....GUN
[0:28:36] <%Fabpsi_> with those swrord skills he doesnt need to summon devils
[0:28:36] <am_omega> Actually, stats go to 40 in this game.
[0:28:43] <Broand> rush attacks and spin attacks? I can see where the SMT mmo got a lot of its inspiration
[0:28:45] <ranarath> This needs a remaster with voice acting.

[0:31:29] <ndcoten> checkin that you're awake with that response
[0:31:33] <BLARGLESNARF> Worst part of P5R was the forced 5 hour makeout session with Raidou in the third palace :/

[0:33:33] <brachydios777> You like jazz, chat?
[0:33:35] <Applecannon63> so demons are like minions like a Moba Kappa
[0:33:42] <Am_Shigar00> @Darmanimon meh, it's alright.

[0:33:51] <sirthomas2step> I love the battle music in these games so melodically frantic
[0:33:51] <JOJOHNNY135> You can capture all demons except bosses, but on full moons they’re nearly impossible to confine. I think that’s how it is at least
[0:33:55] <Parapattern> I bet that pyro demon smells like burning garbage
[0:33:56] <Starotter70> @Darmanimon It's more for affecting demon stats
[0:34:00] <am_omega> @Darmanimon lol, what magic? You mean that the demons use? Yeah.
[0:34:08] <DSD24> Cool Bug Lady in the back
[0:34:09] <%Darmanimon> @andre11dr the cantina theme is good, yes
[0:34:33] <$Superdandy96> So if this ends up being a spoiler, feel free to ignore it, but do demons in this game evolve or do you what you do in persona games to get stronger monsters?
[0:34:35] <am_omega> This is back during the era where the MC did not have magic.
[0:34:40] <%phd_in_thuggery> did someone say cool bug lady?
[0:34:42] <am_omega> and if they did it was shit.

[0:46:01] <time_axis> the era is real but the year isn't
[0:46:01] <Qu1ckyyy> 1930
[0:46:03] <mortificent> Is this during Tojo's rise to power?
[0:46:07] <turboyabo> thats a okiku mushi , caddile pillar .its probably take 30 episodes in to noticed it
[0:46:07] <dds333a> Taisho went on longer than normal
[0:46:07] <Joestar1890> Taisho is real, but this is extended

[0:46:33] <+CaptainJax> these radical dames
[0:46:35] <plushysceptile> IIRC, the deal is that the era, Taisho, is real. Except in the Raidou universe, it's lasted longer than usual
[0:46:38] <Joestar1890> @mortificent No, he never came to power in this game

[0:47:22] <dds333a> @calamity2007 in certain ways
[0:47:23] <Applecannon63> so basically if the west influenced Japan more so like the opposite of Phoenix's twisted world?
[0:47:25] <xeros720> i liked the story of raidou 1 more, but the second plays much better
[0:47:28] <am_omega> Plot wise? Kinda, game wise? Nah the second game.

[0:59:51] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> HE'S PLAYING RAIDOU? FeelsAmazingMan
[0:59:51] <%Theycallmenerf> These games lead to Persona right?
[1:00:01] <BLARGLESNARF> Only the one ending
[1:00:03] <dds333a> @theycallmenerf in the sense of time, yeah
[1:00:07] <maskedmook> @theycallmenerf yeah same timeline
[1:00:11] <xeros720> well, persona 2 was out already
[1:00:12] <+CaptainJax> Oh right this game has MAG
[1:00:13] <%Theycallmenerf> Oh sick!
[1:00:15] <%justmildlilac> Persona had already come out at this point
[1:00:16] <$Superdandy96> Gotta peace out since work is starting, take care y’all!
[1:00:16] <ranarath> @theycallmenerf Kinda. They occur in the same world
[1:00:24] <dds333a> this game is just under the same SMT umbrella as Persona
[1:00:24] <Applecannon63> ah
[1:00:28] <JetpackMcQuack> good boi
[1:00:29] <CatRidder> SPOON
[1:00:30] <%heartlesshealer> Lore is later
[1:00:30] <Leddy_at_Home> In a Spoon
[1:00:32] <BLARGLESNARF> @superdandy96 haf good dae
[1:00:33] <xeros720> oh, there is a lore button, but it might be in the compendium
[1:00:35] <Am_Shigar00> Fire spoon
[1:00:35] <cardamomo88> SPOONNN
[1:00:39] <zanzibarian_hamster> l1?
[1:00:40] <dds333a> Also, only as far as IS LUL
[1:00:41] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> stop linking everything to persona
[1:00:43] <BLARGLESNARF> Spoon
[1:00:46] <stormhawk9891> @WoolieVersus Only in the Compendium
[1:00:46] <bevyrage> psaBlind it's a trident
[1:00:52] <CatRidder> PAT WITH HIS FIRE SPOON
[1:00:54] <%elderpunch> its a spoon
[1:00:56] <Jathspuh> Pat with a tiki torch
[1:00:59] <%Fabpsi_> lore? One day a demon picked up a shovel. But the shovel was also a demon in disguise, so it went up in flames. Now they are both cursed to burn in hell for all eternity
[1:00:59] <andre11dr> Oh shit, i just remember that sequence later with the Dragons, i am not looking forward to that NotLikeThis
[1:01:04] <+tigerfang86> Squad up
[1:01:06] <+FuqBoiSlim> Wow, this is the Star Ocean of Persona
[1:01:09] <%justmildlilac> @ranarath I don't think that's true. All SMT games are separate timelines unless specifically stated so or a direct sequel

[1:03:29] <deviljhojho_> isnt there a zombie cop demon in SMT IV?
[1:03:30] <+WildSevens> can confine but maybe you killed them too fast?
[1:03:33] <%Theycallmenerf> Would this Joestar be like Gappy? I’m only in Part 4 of JoJo.
[1:03:34] <+CaptainJax> I mean you can in other SMTs
[1:03:36] <dinnydanny777> Necromancy limesOk
[1:03:36] <Am_Shigar00> I think you actually could in SMT IV, though it was a pain to do
[1:03:39] <dds333a> @lasthazzerd they kinda explain that too
[1:03:40] <andre11dr> Oh i forgot battles just happen in this game
[1:03:44] <ranarath> Welcome to old school SMTs where random battles can happen anywhere.
[1:03:45] <%Juriasu> it's already fucked up in pokemon that you can catch and cofine pokemon capable of speech
[1:03:46] <JetpackMcQuack> Beat's the other option I suppose
[1:03:47] <Calamity2007> @deviljhojho_ Yes there is also a zombie rasta
[1:03:48] <%LastHazzerd> @deviljhojho_ there's one in Persona 1
[1:03:50] <%heartlesshealer> there's.... a way to have them....
[1:03:50] <Applecannon63> I mean Pokemon has that…
[1:03:51] <linSP> Mindless demons are pretty hard to command
[1:03:57] <linSP> In most smt games
[1:03:58] <%Fabpsi_> and one demon-slave throwing blossoms at you for fancy effects
[1:04:03] <dds333a> @andre11dr that's why the encounters get fucking bad
[1:04:08] <%Fabpsi_> Burn the baby
[1:04:11] <deviljhojho_> @Calamity2007 oh i do remember rasta
[1:04:17] <+ItsRatman> GO MADDEN
[1:04:17] <+CaptainJax> WHERE DEMONS GATHER
[1:04:20] <%Fabpsi_> burn the baby ...later?
[1:04:21] <%justmildlilac> @ranarath Devil Summoner is a title that shows up in several different games, and Raidou appearances are specifically referred to as him going through portals to other worlds. That's why he shows up as an optional boss in Devil Summoner: Soul Hackers and in Nocturne. His timeline is not the same as those others, or the Persona timeline.
[1:04:22] <Dakuu75> it means "Ok boomer"
[1:04:22] <+haitakaa> no igniting babies
[1:04:23] <dds333a> @deviljhojho_ RASTAMAN
[1:04:28] <xeros720> chakra crisps

[1:04:31] <%livlinn> shiaUGH
[1:04:32] <+FuqBoiSlim> I remember being several zombies you can ally with in iv. but they couldn't speak ngish and you had to get an upgrade to Burroughs in order to speak to them
[1:04:36] <cardamomo88> LUL LUL
[1:04:38] <andre11dr> Yeah in the sequel battles only happen in certain areas if i remember right
[1:04:40] <Calamity2007> Yeah you usually cannot even recruit mindless demons normally. You have to fuse into them
[1:04:40] <deviljhojho_> @dds333a the ultimate in rasta themed combat
[1:04:41] <%Juriasu> monkaS
[1:04:43] <Applecannon63> we literally have pokemon black and white ghost pokemon that are use to be dead people

[1:05:08] <ranarath> @justmildlilac Raidou doesn’t show up in Persona so I don’t know why you’re mentioning him.
[1:05:11] <Calamity2007> @Applecannon63 Yeah that line is cool but messed up
[1:05:19] <neostria> LUL
[1:05:27] <%Fabpsi_> burn item shop

[1:05:32] <dds333a> @ranarath true, but Kyouji does
[1:05:47] <dbag202> Bullet for 3 cents
[1:05:49] <Am_Shigar00> it seems a bit effed up you can just buy bullets during this era to me, but what do I know. I'm no expert on the era.
[1:05:54] <+Hollow_Mirage> Yo where this old man getting his CYRO ROUNDS
[1:05:57] <xeros720> yeah, you want those to help with demon "negotiation"
[1:06:08] <time_axis> its an antique shop so they're antique bullets I guess
[1:06:08] <dds333a> @am_shigar00 but you can do that today, easily
[1:06:11] <andre11dr> I forget do you get to craft swords in this or is that something new to 2?
[1:06:11] <Starotter70> OH, A HUNTER!
[1:06:13] <plushysceptile> So apparently 1000 yen in the 1920s was more or less $500 USD
[1:06:14] <%Theycallmenerf> Did we just start this LP?
[1:06:21] <cardamomo88> the jack frost charm
[1:06:29] <%Darmanimon> hee hoo thanks for shopping ho

[1:06:32] <Starotter70> "Make sure to bring more Macca next time!"
[1:06:36] <turboyabo> because you could have gotten a deal later on
[1:06:38] <dds333a> @hollow_mirage they're "special" deliveries
[1:06:38] <maskedmook> I love how all the shop keeps are scummy
[1:06:51] <xeros720> oh, should mention this now, i'm pretty sure if Raidou goes down it's instant game over
[1:07:00] <xeros720> so consider yourself warned
[1:07:01] <%LastHazzerd> they just selling Taoist Elixers?
[1:07:03] <dds333a> @xeros720 yes
[1:07:05] <+FuqBoiSlim> @theycallmenerf yeah you just missed the tutorial and the chapter 1 intro
[1:07:05] <+haitakaa> like a hair ball
[1:07:06] <%livlinn> This is an different era, so 1 yen is roughly equivalent to 1buck
[1:07:06] <%Fabpsi_> anti-poison. What happens if it expires? Is it gonna be anti-anti-poison = poison?
[1:07:13] <Applecannon63> Its a Ox hair… guess its the musky smell?
[1:07:17] <%Darmanimon> oh no time for incorrect conversions of yen to dollars
[1:07:18] <%livlinn> Or more
[1:07:23] <Starotter70> Yeyeyeye Victor

[1:08:11] <StarlitStunner> It’s ya boi
[1:08:13] <%cutemuteprude> I subbed yesterday during emote only, do I still get my direct connection? If so, for more Europecore, check out Pathologic
[1:08:15] <Teyaric> Wait, he doesn't get the temple? he gets a /custom/ fusion mechanism?
[1:08:16] <%justmildlilac> @ranarath *Kuzunoha, my bad. Regardless, they are still different timelines. Persona is a separate thing.
[1:08:17] <CatRidder> he is your igor
[1:08:17] <whimsicallifestyle> "gouma-den" was that baby's first words. what the fuck

[1:08:47] <Leddy_at_Home> @Calamity2007 Closer to SMT Dante than SMT Batman
[1:08:48] <dds333a> @justmildlilac true, but up until IS. these games are literally canon to each other
[1:08:56] <andre11dr> They can also evolve
[1:08:57] <%heartlesshealer> sometimes there's a fun(?) thing that happens during fusion with a random chance
[1:09:02] <dds333a> same for EP, really
[1:09:02] <+Hollow_Mirage> This game its Frankenstein
[1:09:02] <%Darmanimon> trust me, the demons LOVE getting killed
[1:09:06] <JOJOHNNY135> Oh wait this game doesn’t have a compendium. Good luck with that
[1:09:08] <Calamity2007> @Leddy_at_Home But we already have SMT Dante in Nocturne with Dante from the Devil May Cry Series
[1:09:10] <plushysceptile> Fusion method depends on the game, but idea/concept is still the same.
[1:09:13] <%heartlesshealer> enjoy full moons in this game
[1:09:17] <dds333a> @jojohnny135shhhhh, but it does,
[1:09:18] <Am_Shigar00> demondex
[1:09:24] <%livlinn> @streaminginvain Oh shit this is exactly his setups look like LUL
[1:09:28] <Leddy_at_Home> HP AND MP, MP cost a lot of money to recover
[1:09:33] <%Fabpsi_> infinite demon-pats?
[1:09:40] <am_omega> "This game doesn't have a compendium" Kappa
[1:09:41] <maskedmook> idk why they didn't just use the cathedral of shadows for these games
[1:09:44] <JOJOHNNY135> Oh never mind, I’m dumb
[1:09:46] <dds333a> and then you can go on long fusion benders
[1:09:48] <+StreamingInVain> @livlinn Right? lol
[1:10:08] <dds333a> Her and Liz just stringy up use the compendium
[1:10:10] <andre11dr> This doesn't have the random Fiend encounters like the sequel right?
[1:10:11] <%Darmanimon> demons, persona, same shit different game
[1:10:13] <%livlinn> @streaminginvain Tethla-coil goes brrrrr
[1:10:16] <Calamity2007> @dds333a Yep. Which is why I am so glad in later games you can choose what skills your demons inherit
[1:10:29] <dds333a> @andre11dr no, don't think so
[1:10:30] <neostria> sick
[1:10:32] <am_omega> Because the Devil Summoner games like to change it up on how fusion works.
[1:10:36] <BlackermanZX> so hes truly pat
[1:10:38] <+Jakeofalco> history ?
[1:10:44] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Oh man, Raidou. PogChamp
[1:10:44] <am_omega> Soul hackers has a fuckin Ship Captain that does fusion.
[1:10:46] <+montymole445> ps2 pat looking nice and grimy
[1:10:50] <%LastHazzerd> Pat DOES enjoy stoking fires
[1:10:52] <+Arek_1> @Jakeofalco Right? LUL
[1:10:54] <%debrv> Damn.
[1:10:54] <Am_Shigar00> @am_omega Isn't it straight up the same character?
[1:11:02] <%Darmanimon> @BlackermanZX the fire he carries is his twitter hot takes
[1:11:06] <OblivionSword1> ShowOfHands
[1:11:10] <dds333a> my favorite things are either pulling off mutiple fusions in one session, or just going on a long fusion chain to end up with one particular demon

[1:11:14] <+StreamingInVain> @livlinn Seeing it just sends me, lol. Such a good song and fun looking performance
[1:11:17] <andre11dr> I never played Soul Hackers, i should do that one day
[1:11:17] <JOJOHNNY135> Yeah Victor is always the fusion guy in the Devil Summoner series
[1:11:25] <am_omega> In the first two yeah but this one is not the same Victor.
[1:11:31] <andre11dr> Is Soul Hacker a DS one?
[1:11:35] <dds333a> Yes
[1:11:38] <Am_Shigar00> Soul Hackers got a 3DS remake
[1:11:42] <am_omega> well SOul Hackers got a 3DS remake.
[1:11:43] <andre11dr> Damn
[1:11:44] <maskedmook> @andre11dr 3ds yeah
[1:11:51] <deviljhojho_> loyalty is such a dumb system
[1:11:55] <time_axis> must be willing to die for you
[1:11:57] <am_omega> Nah its pretty cheap from what I have seen.
[1:11:58] <+haitakaa> Nemissa is great
[1:12:02] <%BinaryFireball> BinaryFireball subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months! uwu
[1:12:05] <am_omega> Got it for like $18 used.
[1:12:10] <deviljhojho_> at least in the fuckin ds games anyways
[1:12:10] <Applecannon63> Loyalty is basically a stat?
[1:12:10] <Zap_Rowsdower32> I've only played King Abaddon on PS2, though I have Soulless Army on PS3.
[1:12:14] <+snugglepuggs> Loyalty Missions bois!
[1:12:14] <dds333a> Summoner 1 is still suck on the Saturn, but I think there's a fansub
[1:12:16] <+BignanasTheGawd> man victor seems so cool. I hope he doesn't create life out of dead bodies and make a creature that should never have existed.
[1:12:22] <JOJOHNNY135> Loyalty can be a pain but I think it’s really cool
[1:12:27] <linSP> smt strange journey also got a 3ds port, it’s pog
[1:12:28] <time_axis> orders = arcanas basically
[1:12:29] <andre11dr> Why can't Atllus bring all the DS games to the Switch,i just don't understand
[1:12:32] <am_omega> Loyalty is easy, its legit just a bar.
[1:12:32] <Am_Shigar00> @dds333a I heard it got a PSP port in Japan, but sadly we never got it.
[1:12:38] <%livlinn> @streaminginvain His live streaming is good, but I wish I could see it in live once woolieGASM
[1:12:42] <Leddy_at_Home> Orders = Race/Arcana
[1:12:43] <dds333a> @am_shigar00 damn
[1:12:44] <%meniscate> Arcana
[1:12:57] <dds333a> Also, when it comes to loyalty, just get em drunk Kappa
[1:13:02] <JOJOHNNY135> @dds333a there’s a PSP version of Devil Summoner with some quality of life inclusions, it was never localized but the fan English patch is nearly done
[1:13:07] <%Fabpsi_> "unstable fusions" eh, just go nuts and good luck
[1:13:07] <%justmildlilac> @dds333a That's what I'm saying though, they aren't. Kyouji Kuzunoha shows up in Devil Summoner and DS: Soul Hackers, but he is not the same as the Kuzunoha line from Devil Summoner: Raidou Kuzunoha. They share a surname, but they are not the same lineage. The Devil Summoner: Raidou games are separate from the DS -> Persona timeline. I understand the confusion, though.
[1:13:09] <dds333a> Or race
[1:13:12] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh up til now i thought they mean which one is in slot one and two LUL
[1:13:14] <%heartlesshealer> egg group
[1:13:15] <+StreamingInVain> @livlinn Wait, he livestreams? I never knew that
[1:13:21] <%Darmanimon> yo chat you all saw the Luke reveal for SF5, right? Is it me or does he look like ass? His gameplay seems insanely fun tho
[1:13:48] <time_axis> its a huge pain to get the skills you want in this game
[1:13:48] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:13:49] <cardamomo88> GAMBA demons
[1:13:50] <BigYanno> Which fusion uses the potara earings and which uses the dance?
[1:13:51] <dds333a> @justmildlilac that's all correct, but Daisuke is literally Kyouji's newest body
[1:13:59] <Vashido22> always go back
[1:14:03] <dds333a> As long as I'm not misunderstanding
[1:14:04] <andre11dr> @darmanimon I think his gameplay is intriguing, but yeah his an ass design
[1:14:08] <%livlinn> @streaminginvain Sorry, more like live broadcast of his concerts
[1:14:10] <+Arek_1> @Darmanimon Yeah. Luke looks bland. His gameplay is explosive, sure. But his visual design is wack.
[1:14:11] <turboyabo> woolie too lazy to simply go in and go back out
[1:14:18] <%heartlesshealer> there's always backing out once you see the skill list to re-roll the skills
[1:14:20] <Qu1ckyyy> OMG the X X O O X spam I have PTSD from that
[1:14:21] <DSD24> Luke has dumb hair
[1:14:26] <Am_Shigar00> SMT IV's fusion system was stupidly indepth
[1:14:34] <+FuqBoiSlim> Wait, Soul Hackers on 3DS? isn't Summoner 1?
[1:14:35] <andre11dr> Iff they wanted to make a MMA fighter they could've done something MUCH COOLER
[1:14:38] <maskedmook> SMT4 had the best demon fusion system
[1:14:38] <+CaptainJax> SMT4's fusion is so nice to use
[1:14:40] <+bullprophet> back when SMT was half spreadsheet game
[1:14:48] <dds333a> The worst part is when the FIRST result is the best one, and you can never get it back
[1:14:50] <andre11dr> But we got discount Guile
[1:14:53] <+StreamingInVain> @livlinn Ah I see XD yea, I'd definitely like to see him live as well.
[1:14:57] <cardamomo88> moon
[1:14:59] <Calamity2007> @Am_Shigar00 It gave you an extensive search feature, something I hope is carried over in V
[1:15:03] <%Darmanimon> @andre11dr no that was the fortnite reveal
[1:15:03] <reonome> oh boy moon phases
[1:15:04] <CatRidder> TIME TO BREED
[1:15:06] <deviljhojho_> not the fucking moon phases
[1:15:09] <%heartlesshealer> ENJOY FULL MOONS
[1:15:12] <crocboyz> THE MOON
[1:15:13] <Darren716> Wasn't that already a thing in P4?
[1:15:14] <dds333a> always been the case LUL
[1:15:14] <%Juriasu> woolieACCIDENT
[1:15:17] <Futurecity10> phase of the moon is SMT3- all the way up to 4
[1:15:17] <Joestar1890> @FuqBoiSlim Nope Devil Summoner is Ps1 and PSP only
[1:15:18] <%cobalt_phoenix_> woolieACCIDENT
[1:15:19] <BlackermanZX> happy little accidents
[1:15:26] <%Irridium> woolieACCIDENT woolieACCIDENT woolieACCIDENT
[1:15:28] <Am_Shigar00> aaaah fusion accidents
[1:15:29] <%debrv> Woolie..... Woolie, you are gonna need a fucking spreadsheet for this.
[1:15:31] <Applecannon63> I honestly like Luke's dumb hair maybe it would've looked better in SFVI's style
[1:15:34] <%meniscate> Soul Hackers/SJ flashbacks
[1:15:40] <%debrv> Jesus.
[1:15:49] <JOJOHNNY135> @darren716 no, that was only in Persona 3. The moon system never showed up again after that
[1:15:50] <+FuqBoiSlim> Raidou Kuzunoha Vs The Spreadsheet Army
[1:15:53] <Leddy_at_Home> Every SMT had "moon" Phases, they change the name, only IV didn't have them, and SMT V is bringing them back
[1:15:53] <Calamity2007> Fusion accidents could either screw you or give you a dis one nuke
[1:15:55] <am_omega> The demon fusion chart in Raidou 1 is small as hell.
[1:15:56] <maskedmook> I almost never have accidents happen
[1:15:58] <dds333a> @futurecity10 moon phase also factors in SMT1-2,
[1:15:58] <+FuqBoiSlim> @joestar1890 ah, I see
[1:15:59] <Am_Shigar00> Accidents had a bad habit of happening to me at the worst of times when I played through Royal
[1:16:00] <reonome> only P3 had moon phases, and those didn't affect persona fusion
[1:16:01] <%justmildlilac> @dds333a I'm not arguing against that? All I was saying is that the Raidou games are not canon to Persona, as they are not connected to the other Devil Summoner games that do connect to Persona. I think somewhere along the line we started arguing the same point from different perspectives, lol
[1:16:02] <Darren716> I think I'm confusing it with weather in 4
[1:16:02] <+BignanasTheGawd> "I once created an accident i needed to hunt down in the artic because he killed my wife"
[1:16:08] <%livlinn> @streaminginvain We can still hope joofbBless
[1:16:14] <andre11dr> Ok people can call me crazy, but i always find the moon fase mechanic to be annoying
[1:16:15] <dds333a> In P3, moon phases don't affect fusion, too
[1:16:26] <+StreamingInVain> @livlinn Indeed
[1:16:33] <%heartlesshealer> the moon phase thing is a mixed bag
[1:16:43] <+FuqBoiSlim> First fusion accident for me was in P4G and I ended up with Shiki-Ouji. I hate that paper mf to this day
[1:16:45] <Am_Shigar00> @andre11dr I'm honestly not the biggest fan of moon in the games I've played. I hope SMT V's take is not too bad, but I haven't seem much of it yet.
[1:16:46] <Qu1ckyyy> I once got a Girimehkala with Debilitate while I was on super early game in SJ, sometimes accidents are good
[1:16:47] <%heartlesshealer> especially since it also affects demon negotiation
[1:16:48] <%meniscate> When's Dante from the Devil May Cry Series showing up?
[1:16:52] <Joestar1890> @FuqBoiSlim Just an FYI Soul Hackers is basically Devil Summoner 2 with the 3ds being a remake, while DS1's remake was released for PSP
[1:16:53] <%Fabpsi_> trustworthy shop
[1:17:00] <LoreKeeper_Thal> right down the road!
[1:17:08] <%Fabpsi_> kids go there all the time
[1:17:12] <JetpackMcQuack> CVS / necromancy lab
[1:17:14] <dds333a> @justmildlilac maybe so, but I was always interpreted that as that being the case since he's there, but then again, we may actually be on the same page LUL
[1:17:17] <Parapattern> A scientist? And he's playing God?
[1:17:22] <Applecannon63> The only reason I can give a pass to Luke's design cause the style of Streetfighter 5 is very mixed like look at Abigail…
[1:17:39] <dds333a> in DDS, it's the sun Kappa
[1:17:43] <%Deft_Thought> You barely get crowds in games now
[1:17:45] <dds333a> and it affects very little
[1:17:47] <%Darmanimon> do you think God stays in heaven because he, too, is afraid of what he's created?
[1:17:47] <jetjagger222> remember how smtiv had not-snake plissken in it as a bartender

[1:20:56] <Calamity2007> @DSD24 Yes and said demon actually calls him out on that when you find her.

[1:23:11] <%paladinstarbuster> hes a big bullet
[1:23:12] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> this was atlus at their peak before p3 ruined everything
[1:23:14] <Leddy_at_Home> Fun Fact: SMT V is adding a new Suffix for "Severe" type attacks -Barion, So Agibarion, Bufubarion......
[1:23:18] <+FuqBoiSlim> Bufu Bufula Bufudyne
[1:23:19] <dds333a> then there's lao, sometimes

[1:33:04] <maskedmook> the battle theme for this game kicks ass
[1:33:05] <%Darmanimon> you need to buy a license to equip  this demon
[1:33:06] <%Sweetangy021> @dds333a Yoshitsune is the best
[1:33:07] <Darren716> Just checked, it would be like 271 USD
[1:33:11] <+CaptainJax> I forget what magic even does in this game
[1:33:15] <DSD24> Yoshitsune is always cool
[1:33:15] <time_axis> its mainly item drops I think
[1:33:17] <MisterCrimson> Moon phase is super important to gameplay. A full Moon is when demons are most dangerous and can't be negotiated/captured. @WoolieVersus
[1:33:18] <Darren716> Based on 2000 yen= 20 USD
[1:33:19] <Am_Shigar00> Magic is Magic Defense in this game
[1:33:20] <turboyabo> mag is more helpful

[1:33:22] <Leddy_at_Home> *Magnetite, not magic
[1:33:24] <Calamity2007> I think luck mostly just affects item drops and crits
[1:33:35] <%meniscate> Big demons Kreygasm Kreygasm
[1:33:36] <+haitakaa> MAG is demon food
[1:33:36] <dds333a> @sweetangy021 yeah, yeah, he's cool, but that Susano'o is even better

[1:34:44] <Am_Shigar00> So Raidou is literally mashing a button on his tubes.

[1:35:17] <cardamomo88> i mean yes but i think this is even more horny
[1:35:21] <BurdRightsActivist> Looks like a fucking digimon
[1:35:22] <%Sweetangy021> He's cool and real strong also similar to a ligaroo
[1:35:24] <emptyantics> Raidou is so cool and doesn’t afraid of anyone
[1:35:25] <%Juriasu> beat em up
[1:35:27] <DSD24> Shakedown

[1:35:40] <turboyabo> obariyon can blow back vehicles
[1:35:40] <Teyaric> Isn't Obariyion like, a bully-adjacent spirit?
[1:35:44] <CatRidder> mister shakedown
[1:35:47] <emptyantics> MR SHAKEDOWN 2
[1:35:48] <dds333a> @darmanimon lates
[1:36:01] <turboyabo> no his a piggy back spirit that gives you gold
[1:36:02] <%Sweetangy021> @Teyaric Think cheap-trick from Jojo
[1:36:02] <AThing_> you don't have to but it's fun flavor
[1:36:10] <AThing_> Sometimes you do but the game will make it very clear when that is the case
[1:36:13] <+AndrewsLovesPizza> Boolie Maddens awakens
[1:36:15] <+FuqBoiSlim> Obariyon is literally just vibing
[1:36:16] <Am_Shigar00> Question marks are field skills you don't have, if you do, then they're just greyed out.
[1:36:25] <alrobot2014> he's got a jaunty little dance
[1:36:25] <Darren716> Dont you need higher loyalty?
[1:36:35] <zedravan> chad stride
[1:36:38] <%meniscate> Obariyon doing the FLOSS NotLikeThis
[1:36:43] <BlackermanZX> obariyon is in permanent dance emote
[1:36:44] <Dakuu75> this game is suppose to be notoriously hard right? Like the Ninja Gaiden of JRPGs?
[1:36:54] <dds333a> @teyaric yeah, in myth, he's an asshole who attaches to random people, and he incredibly heavy and won't let go, however, if you get him all the way home, he turns into gold
[1:36:57] <cardamomo88> read her
[1:36:59] <emptyantics> @meniscate I can’t unsee it now NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[1:36:59] <%Fabpsi_> knowledgeable young lady...well *this* lady needs her mind read
[1:37:04] <Am_Shigar00> @Dakuu75 It's not that hard, just rough in places
[1:37:04] <DSD24> @Dakuu75 You are thinking about Nocturne
[1:37:07] <dds333a> @dakuu75 no this one
[1:37:08] <%Sweetangy021> @Dakuu75 Nah that's nocturne
[1:37:21] <am_omega> Also Nocturne is memed to be hard.
[1:37:22] <Applecannon63> mind readable
[1:37:32] <%Fabpsi_> scent of blood...thirsty vampire?!
[1:37:33] <dds333a> @am_omega this is the truth
[1:37:39] <am_omega> If you just prep Nocturne is not hard.
[1:37:42] <%Arnoldoaad1> BLUUD!
[1:37:44] <DSD24> @am_omega That is what Matador does to people
[1:37:44] <am_omega> Just know your tools.
[1:37:48] <emptyantics> !uptime
[1:37:48] <@Moobot> @emptyantics WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 52 minutes
[1:37:51] <Am_Shigar00> yeah, Nocturne is really not that bad. It's just punishing. Once you get the hang of it it's pretty smooth
[1:37:54] <%meniscate> but feet tho
[1:38:08] <dds333a> as long as you fill in as much of the map as possible, and tun away as little as possible, only bosses pose a  threat
[1:38:12] <DSD24> Swing my arms like this!
[1:38:14] <+FuqBoiSlim> smt games are hard the on the first when you don't know how everything works. also less options in general
[1:38:18] <turboyabo> yah obariyon will push your butt in
[1:38:18] <MisterCrimson> SMT games have a tendency to be harder towards the beginning when you have limited acess to skills and demons
[1:38:30] <andre11dr> Nocturne on HARD is the super intense one  but that's just because sometimes the game hits you with BS one shots
[1:38:31] <am_omega> Yeah Matador tells you that "its a pop quiz: are you using buffs?"
[1:38:39] <Applecannon63> So Raidou Kuzonoha is just Ace Attourney with demons but with Star Ocean action combat
[1:38:44] <+FuqBoiSlim> 4 turns into a cakewalk after Medusa tbh
[1:38:50] <DSD24> Matador maximizes his agility and then kills you
[1:38:52] <+haitakaa> dogs
[1:38:55] <Qu1ckyyy> Shisha ?
[1:38:56] <+haitakaa> guardian dog things
[1:38:56] <xeros720> i think the lion dogs?
[1:38:57] <+CaptainJax> Crows I think?
[1:38:58] <andre11dr> Also TDE boss is especially hard in Nocturne
[1:38:59] <xeros720> yeah, shisha
[1:39:00] <dds333a> shiisha
[1:39:03] <emptyantics> Is the best demon Lucifer in this game?
[1:39:04] <OblivionSword1> Shisha I think ?
[1:39:08] <turboyabo> those are suppose to be nue i remember rirght
[1:39:12] <%meniscate> fuu dogs
[1:39:12] <dds333a> @emptyantics welp
[1:39:15] <turboyabo> if
[1:39:18] <am_omega> And for Matador if you null or absorb wind you stomp him.
[1:39:22] <DSD24> Daidouji the best Senran Kagura character
[1:39:23] <Applecannon63> lion guard dogs?
[1:39:29] <%livlinn> SHIBES
[1:39:36] <andre11dr> @emptyantics In the second game
[1:39:42] <Darren716> Woolie if they don't have a ? you can't do anything to them
[1:39:53] <Darren716> I think
[1:39:57] <dds333a> he was looking for the right one
[1:40:04] <andre11dr> You don't get to fight Lucifer in this one
[1:40:26] <linSP> just get yourself a demon to make you feel better
[1:40:57] <+FerdytheNerdy> Stand Power
[1:40:59] <Leddy_at_Home> You can interrupt the 2nd hit, but not the heavy at the end
[1:41:06] <%meniscate> I just realized that the demons in SMT are literally redpilled
[1:41:07] <dds333a> yeah, they can be canceled, but not the final swing
[1:41:10] <emptyantics> I love the fact that the random battles just happen in the middle of towns LUL

[1:41:20] <Applecannon63> @linsp like the Yo-kais from Yokai Watch?
[1:41:24] <dds333a> although you can also charge the spin by the third slash
[1:41:27] <skagtheprinceofhell> So is this a remaster or rerelease?
[1:41:31] <darkfox1995> !uptime
[1:41:31] <@Moobot> @darkfox1995 WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 56 minutes
[1:41:38] <am_omega> this is just the normal game.
[1:41:42] <Joestar1890> @skagtheprinceofhell It's the original game
[1:41:44] <alrobot2014> its the ps2 "HD"
[1:41:44] <time_axis> nice
[1:41:47] <+FuqBoiSlim> @skagtheprinceofhell nah looks like he's playing on "original hardware"
[1:41:51] <+haitakaa> you got a second hand anal bead
[1:41:54] <+haitakaa> congrats
[1:41:55] <am_omega> The Raidou games have not gotten a re-release or a remaster.
[1:42:03] <am_omega> and its a damn shame.
[1:42:03] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:42:06] <%xxMylord> Woolie has a heavly modded PS2
[1:42:06] <Am_Shigar00> They totally should, I'd love a raidou HD collection
[1:42:18] <The_Adie> They better get something tho, imagine if Atlus went for all of the PS2 games on new consoles/PC
[1:42:19] <+FuqBoiSlim> you don't count PSN as a re-release?
[1:42:24] <skagtheprinceofhell> So what was that thing they were talking about Raidou yesterday on the podcast? Or did I just misheard him say he'd be playing it soon?
[1:42:29] <time_axis> pre-rendered games are tricky in HD, they'd need to re-render everything or AI upscale I guess
[1:42:30] <am_omega> Eh not really.
[1:42:31] <emptyantics> My ps2 looks suspiciously like a PC :)
[1:42:40] <turboyabo> you gotta take note your demons attack animation
[1:42:42] <dds333a> PSN is def a rerelease, it's just not an updated one, guys
[1:42:58] <Applecannon63> attack cues?
[1:43:01] <andre11dr> @am_shigar00 Not only that but DDS games have never gotten a rerelease
[1:43:06] <darkfox1995> Ahhh the game apart of a series with GODLIKE music
[1:43:11] <am_omega> I would love a DDS and Raidou HD remaster.
[1:43:23] <+FuqBoiSlim> idk even if it's not changed up at all its still on different hardware. to each their own
[1:43:29] <am_omega> Even though I already own them.
[1:43:34] <am_omega> I would just love to have them.
[1:43:48] <andre11dr> Wich is even more tragic ,cause those games are abjectly some of the best OS2 ones
[1:43:55] <%Sweetangy021> @am_omega Seriously bring hd DDS to break everyone's hearts
[1:43:57] <%samTUMZfestival> samTUMZfestival subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months, currently on a 6 month streak! Hope you're doing well, Woolie and Reggie. Thanks for the streams; always appreciate hearing your take on things, Woolz. You're a legend.
[1:44:07] <dds333a> @fuqboislim no, I agree on that too, just speaking in general with what Atlus has done for years now
[1:44:09] <Am_Shigar00> yeah, the vision cone was really nice
[1:44:14] <am_omega> Let me 100% DDS1 again like the madman I am.
[1:44:19] <turboyabo> you better save as soon as possible because this demon summoner and not the forgiving persona 5
[1:44:27] <emptyantics> I hope that with the new Engine they have for SMT V they can remaster alot of the older SMT
[1:44:30] <am_omega> and re-fight Demi-fiend. Because I hate myself.
[1:44:40] <andre11dr> Like the Raidou games are cool but DDS are way more interesting to me
[1:44:47] <dds333a> @am_omega you and me both brother
[1:44:48] <%Sweetangy021> Enjoy the grind on the way there
[1:44:54] <BurdRightsActivist> Best Battle theme tbh
[1:44:55] <CatRidder> PAT WILL DIE FOR YOU
[1:44:56] <BlackermanZX> he will fight god for you
[1:44:57] <dds333a> Gun runs in DDS are great too
[1:44:59] <+TenWren> he's ready for the meat grinder
[1:45:09] <+FuqBoiSlim> Based and Agi-pilled Ukobach
[1:45:13] <penitentpendant> Totally possible, level 4 demon.
[1:45:19] <am_omega> Like DDS is like 40 hours long but my ass has 300 hours.
[1:45:22] <am_omega> of just grinding.
[1:45:26] <emptyantics> @andre11dr Is there a gameplay difference between DDS and regular SMT’s?
[1:45:30] <am_omega> maxed mantras for everyone.
[1:45:30] <+Hollow_Mirage> He will be a part of the next demon you fuse
[1:45:31] <+FuqBoiSlim> You better bring him to the end of the game like people do with Pixie in Nocturne 😡
[1:45:35] <%meniscate> Ukobae BibleThump
[1:45:35] <+Arek_1> LUL
[1:45:37] <dds333a> @emptyantics significantly
[1:45:42] <Applecannon63> become one with hive mind
[1:45:53] <tentavision> you'll fuse him to make a stronger guy, who you'll fuse to make another guy, etc, who you'll fuse to make your end game demon partner
[1:45:59] <andre11dr> @emptyantics DDS dosen't have demons
[1:46:00] <Applecannon63> as minced meat minds
[1:46:02] <dds333a> In DDS, there's a fixed party, for one
[1:46:07] <$SilverRoddo> We’re down with the devil games.  The kids love the devil games
[1:46:08] <TTouchdown> It’s implied in some games that the new demon retains the memories of the fused
[1:46:13] <dds333a> and no demon negotiation or summoning
[1:46:14] <TheDwarvenBard> Traditional SMT is you summoning demons; DDS is you ARE the demons, and you master skillsets to customize your available skills
[1:46:17] <am_omega> And no recruiting demons in DDS.
[1:46:17] <andre11dr> Well it does but it's just thst YOU are the demon
[1:46:30] <Applecannon63> so like Namekian Fusion
[1:46:34] <+CaptainJax> save
[1:46:37] <dds333a> you can also change any skills you've learned on the fly in DDS
[1:46:43] <%heartlesshealer> dds is squad tactics with your character's friends as unit leaders
[1:46:44] <am_omega> Also you fight Demi-fiend as a NG+ boss. Its the normal battle theme.
[1:47:00] <andre11dr> DDS is basically everyone has a Devil Trigger
[1:47:02] <am_omega> that is how lowly you are to him.
[1:47:11] <TheDwarvenBard> Love the implication that for a super-boss, you're just another random encounter
[1:47:24] <dds333a> @am_omega that, and it's the more recognizable theme LUL
[1:47:30] <am_omega> Hope you don't have the wrong null skill
[1:47:31] <DSD24> He will also just kill you with Pixie
[1:47:31] <+Arek_1> LUL
[1:47:34] <am_omega> or he just one shots you.
[1:47:39] <+FuqBoiSlim> some real "But for me it's was a Tuesday" energy in that fight
[1:47:45] <Am_Shigar00> Of course he has pixie
[1:47:48] <dds333a> Demi had one of those really bad random encounters CarlSmile
[1:47:50] <Applecannon63> Naruma or Raidou just Shotaro from KR W
[1:47:50] <TheDwarvenBard> For the SMT MMO, Imagine, they gave the Demifiend superboss a super great Normal Battle remix
[1:47:55] <darkfox1995> Ah to be a Devil Summoner
[1:48:00] <cardamomo88> ???
[1:48:07] <%meniscate> Boss baby
[1:48:10] <+TenWren> thank you cursed child
[1:48:11] <Dr_Mooose> fear the child
[1:48:11] <Qu1ckyyy> Death 13 baby
[1:48:13] <BlacSoul> yeet the infant
[1:48:15] <Am_Shigar00> Baby is down with the demons
[1:48:15] <%Fabpsi_> wtf
[1:48:18] <dds333a> He can FEEL it
[1:48:19] <%Fabpsi_> burn the baby
[1:48:20] <time_axis> is Baby Geniuses canon to this
[1:48:21] <penitentpendant> Half Demon?
[1:48:28] <am_omega> Legit the Demi-fiend was THE hardest JRPG boss fight. Like actually sweating.
[1:48:31] <+Hollow_Mirage> Baby Stand?
[1:48:31] <+CaptainJax> Baby...? Stando...?
[1:48:32] <%Fabpsi_> playmates AND demons
[1:48:32] <linSP> babies possessed
[1:48:38] <am_omega> and I hear Satan in 2 is harder.
[1:48:39] <dds333a> nobody else knows, but HE does
[1:48:40] <Leddy_at_Home> Well, not all demons are evil, in fact, that's the main plot point of Jack Bros
[1:48:48] <DSD24> Aww yeah this song
[1:48:48] <tentavision> antichrist baby i guess
[1:48:49] <dds333a> Mannish Boy
[1:49:02] <stevenellis386> this beat is tough
[1:49:07] <%heartlesshealer> nurarihyon ideals for this baby
[1:49:07] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:49:10] <JaruLee83> haven't played a Shin Migami Tensei game in ages. looking forward to this =)
[1:49:13] <dds333a> @am_omega Satan requires a fucking calculator, yeah
[1:49:19] <maskedmook> the first thing I did was buy as many as these bullets as I could
[1:49:20] <tentavision> can't wait for V
[1:49:28] <andre11dr> Which game has the best level up music?
[1:49:38] <am_omega> Well there is no carry over bonus for beating it in DDS2 so fuck doing that fight.
[1:49:40] <andre11dr> I'll go P5 or DDS 1
[1:49:40] <Leddy_at_Home> @andre11dr This one
[1:49:44] <penitentpendant> The Nose Knows
[1:49:46] <+DenpaDev> the bdsm room
[1:49:46] <Dakuu75> you wish

[1:50:05] <%meniscate> Mido BibleThump BibleThump
[1:50:07] <Zeppelee> No Velvet Room in old school SMT.
[1:50:11] <akajaybay> I never realized this was action battles
[1:50:14] <jaysondeez> still a spin off, but closer to SMT yeah
[1:50:17] <am_omega> @TenWren He just came over, say there was room and pays rent.
[1:50:18] <dds333a> Yeah, Satan. just gives you his normal shit LUL
[1:50:19] <jaysondeez> I love this music
[1:50:20] <Am_Shigar00> RIP Mido, all hail booby Sophia.

[1:50:29] <jaysondeez> creepy ambiance
[1:50:29] <+TenWren> @am_omega you know, fair enough
[1:50:31] <%LastHazzerd> wonder what SMTV will call their fusion room
[1:50:31] <skagtheprinceofhell> Instead of Igor, you get Victor
[1:50:34] <DSD24> Azumi is a cool merman
[1:50:49] <%Sweetangy021> @WoolieVersus Raidou 1 came out after P3 and P1 and P2 had Igor

[1:50:56] <dds333a> Mermaid, methinks
[1:51:01] <WeijiBeng> I love this game I used to speed run this but the american version has some changes that make it REALLY hard
[1:51:06] <andre11dr> The Ars Goeta demons aren't in this aren't they?
[1:51:09] <Zeppelee> Philemon is still my homeboy, however.
[1:51:11] <%meniscate> Persona 3 was like this tho right?
[1:51:15] <dds333a> @andre11dr some are
[1:51:17] <Darren716> Ah fuck I just got the joke of Victor being the old one, and Igor being in Persona. It's like Igor, Frankenstein's assistant
[1:51:18] <Am_Shigar00> @WeijiBeng I haven't heard of that. What are some of the changes?
[1:51:19] <+CursedNobleman> GENGAR?!

[1:51:56] <%AlteisenReiseZ> CHEAP TRICK
[1:51:58] <%heartlesshealer> I like how some demon and youkai myths were to explain away home invaders

[1:52:15] <dds333a> You have to put it back
[1:52:16] <%kewlmyc> Pretty sure it's what Cheap Trick is based off of
[1:52:17] <+CaptainJax> DROP BABIES
[1:52:18] <%heartlesshealer> Cheap Trick is explicitly based on Obariyon
[1:52:21] <cardamomo88> WutFace WutFace

[1:52:23] <%Lion_kun> Woolie told this story on the old podcast

[1:52:28] <stevenellis386> call that a baby daddy
[1:52:30] <+wunp_fxs> oh no
[1:52:33] <xeros720> drop bears are surprisingly common
[1:52:35] <WeijiBeng> Cibelle boss and the encounter with the rider 1 the rider can BARELY be evitaded meanwhile the jp is easy, while cibelle has no weakeness the JP boss has a weakness to wind I think
[1:52:35] <%livlinn> woolieOMG
[1:52:35] <%LastHazzerd> @Dakuu75 cheap trick
[1:52:38] <stantheman_97> i remember this LUL
[1:52:41] <am_omega> Yo we talkin demons? Wanna talk about Fhilipino demons?
[1:52:41] <dds333a> mythology, man
[1:52:54] <+Arek_1> monkaS
[1:52:57] <jaysondeez> demon is fucking having the best time of his life
[1:52:57] <dds333a> We're I'm from, we have SANTERIA
[1:52:58] <am_omega> How about a floating heads and organs coming to kill you.
[1:52:59] <+TenWren> i like hearing about parallels in mythology
[1:53:00] <%meniscate> Machete man is the ultimate persona
[1:53:03] <TonberryLives> Grenada is the true SMT
[1:53:04] <Leddy_at_Home> Hey you don't know man, SMT V just introduced a Philippian Demon, sooooo
[1:53:04] <%Indigo_Automaton> We just got Bigfoot over here
[1:53:05] <%LastHazzerd> i would like to hear that
[1:53:06] <Darren716> Machete Man is the top rank of the devil arcarna
[1:53:10] <deagles6> oh yeah a new phillipino demon added smtv
[1:53:11] <MisterCrimson> SMT could use more Island Culture demons. Some of that shit is straight nightmares
[1:53:16] <andre11dr> Yeah your not getting those demons in SMT aren't you LUL
[1:53:16] <am_omega> I do know.
[1:53:25] <Joestar1890> The Machete Allignment
[1:53:27] <xeros720> macheteman is up there with mothman and jersey devil
[1:53:31] <Zeppelee> Let's do the fork in the garbage disposal!
[1:53:36] <AThing_> @MisterCrimson  The portable ones tend to have more obscure ones
[1:53:40] <CatRidder> floridaman confirm for SMT
[1:53:43] <dds333a> Baron Samedhi is somewhat in SMT
[1:53:49] <Ziegsy> @Zeppelee Ting-ta-ting itng!
[1:53:50] <DSD24> Look how cute the Raidou icon is
[1:53:50] <AThing_> the console games have a lot less obscure ones because 3d means limited amount of m odels
[1:53:51] <andre11dr> Well there is one demon that is just A BIKER DUDE THAT WENT TO HELL
[1:53:52] <dds333a> classic icon, too
[1:53:52] <am_omega> Oh man, if I knew pixel art I would try and make Machette man in the SMT1/SMT2 style.
[1:53:52] <+StreamingInVain> Anyone ever heard of goat foot woman?
[1:53:53] <Am_Shigar00> Those character icons always make me think of board game pieces
[1:53:56] <jaysondeez> this looks familar
[1:53:56] <DSD24> He's got the little hat
[1:53:58] <jaysondeez> smt2
[1:53:58] <+FuqBoiSlim> yeah you get to fuse for machete man if you max the nurse's social link in p4g im pretty sure
[1:53:59] <TheDwarvenBard> We had Chemtrails in SMT IV, how about Alex Jones in SMT V?
[1:54:01] <jaysondeez> this type of map
[1:54:09] <DianaTheAscian> theres a ygo game that does thus
[1:54:11] <Leddy_at_Home> Kinda sad this is gone now, but now we have full on Open World exploration, so eh
[1:54:13] <DianaTheAscian> this*
[1:54:16] <DSD24> @andre11dr Hell Biker is the coolest
[1:54:31] <SomeGuy187> Final boss of SMT Grenada is Ronald Regan
[1:54:32] <Am_Shigar00> I remember in the manga it states that Raidou rarely goes to school
[1:54:33] <maskedmook> I love exploring old Japan in games
[1:54:34] <+FuqBoiSlim> @thedwarvenbard Imagine seeing "Fiend: Covid Vaccine" show up in SMTV
[1:54:35] <Qu1ckyyy> <High> so yeah he is a high schooler
[1:54:37] <%meniscate> @thedwarvenbard Fuse two Abaddons to get him
[1:54:39] <xeros720> this is a lot easier to navigate than 4 for sure
[1:54:43] <%diegobandzz> Yo this is ancient
[1:54:44] <am_omega> Yo legit I would love Alex Jones as a character in SMT.
[1:54:48] <am_omega> that would be based as shit.
[1:54:55] <linSP> I’m kinda hoping smt V doesn’t have this overworld, 4 was a pain
[1:54:59] <TheDwarvenBard> @FuqBoiSlim panic ailment auto-inflicted
[1:55:03] <andre11dr> Why can't we get Dracula in SMT ?
[1:55:07] <am_omega> Like "interdimensional vampires" would be a legit thing.
[1:55:10] <xeros720> smt 5 seems to be standard jrpg as far as we've seen
[1:55:13] <WeijiBeng> woolie should play imagine online
[1:55:15] <andre11dr> Well i guess we did get Vlad once
[1:55:16] <Zeppelee> I have a Palico named after Gouto.
[1:55:20] <xeros720> honestly, i'm not even sure it has an overworld right now
[1:55:21] <MisterCrimson> @FuqBoiSlim I mean, there have been just viruses as enemies in some games
[1:55:26] <deagles6> it seems to be like 3
[1:55:29] <%meniscate> Man, Imagine was the shit. peak 2000s
[1:55:34] <TheDwarvenBard> Imagine is super fun but is maximum anti-Woolie
[1:55:39] <maskedmook> @linsp if it's like Apocalypse and has markers for where to go next it will be fine
[1:55:40] <dds333a> @xeros720 much of SMT, could be considered "standard JRPG" too
[1:55:41] <am_omega> Man Imagine was great.
[1:55:46] <skagtheprinceofhell> Salem
[1:55:52] <andre11dr> Imagine was uhhhjj
[1:55:52] <DSD24> Gouto being a cool sounding man is rad as fuck
[1:55:52] <Qu1ckyyy> Exactly that
[1:55:52] <skagtheprinceofhell> From Sabrina
[1:55:55] <cardamomo88> FLUFFY
[1:55:57] <%AlteisenReiseZ> I was thinking Katz from Courage
[1:55:57] <%diegobandzz> Yo Lmaoo
[1:56:00] <ExpressNode> I just think of the cat person from Bleach
[1:56:00] <am_omega> Like I remember doing dungeon runs for folks.
[1:56:00] <dds333a> V will have all the standard SMT fare
[1:56:03] <%meniscate> @andre11dr pretty much Kudlak
[1:56:06] <Rutilas9000> I'm currently playing smt 4 right now. So far pretty good
[1:56:10] <TheDwarvenBard> Hypothetical private servers that I cannot confirm nor deny means Imagine IS great still
[1:56:10] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:56:12] <DSD24> The Bloodline ends with me
[1:56:13] <%Sweetangy021> Doesn't Gotou have a deep voice in the nocturne remake?
[1:56:21] <am_omega> Gotou does.
[1:56:21] <Am_Shigar00> Daidouji gives me fun SMT III memories.
[1:56:23] <AThing_> yes
[1:56:28] <DSD24> @Sweetangy021 Yes he does he's voiced by Mitsurugi from SC6
[1:56:29] <alrobot2014> imagining Sol's voice on this cat just gives me a good chuckle
[1:56:34] <Zeppelee> Gouto is voiced by Ray Chase.
[1:56:34] <xeros720> @dds333a you're right, but i'm thinking of SMT vs. final fantasy world maps really
[1:56:35] <am_omega> Mr. Yorokobe Shounen himself.
[1:56:35] <dds333a> @sweetangy021 yes, for reasons that will be made apparent later
[1:56:40] <+CursedNobleman> LUL
[1:56:42] <dds333a> YOU TRUSTED ME
[1:56:44] <%Sweetangy021> I remember why
[1:56:49] <+Arek_1> LUL
[1:56:50] <stantheman_97> why do we fall?
[1:56:56] <+StooEsq> just have most talking cats voiced by Keith David, like in Coraline
[1:57:06] <+JupiterDjin> WOODHOUSE
[1:57:08] <%Prevot> woodhouse
[1:57:10] <drunken_lemur> WODEHOUSE!
[1:57:11] <+CursedNobleman> CEASAAAAR
[1:57:11] <%Sweetangy021> Thank goodness he's not the same Gotou from SMT1
[1:57:11] <turboyabo> woood house
[1:57:15] <CatRidder> Woodhouse
[1:57:15] <%Irridium> WOODHOUSE
[1:57:23] <am_omega> Yeah, BUT WHEN IS THORMAN
[1:57:24] <Applecannon63> WOOD HOUSE!
[1:57:25] <dds333a> @xeros720 fair enough, yeah
[1:57:35] <Am_Shigar00> Oh thorman
[1:57:35] <am_omega> Senator "Make it a Trilogy" Thorman
[1:57:36] <%Fabpsi_> i want to know the butler-thoughts. "Dear god I will burn this house down"
[1:57:42] <%Fabpsi_> mind-read all the way
[1:57:43] <TheDwarvenBard> Thorman is just Nocturne Thor but in a tux
[1:57:55] <am_omega> It is but I love he just fuckin nukes Japan.
[1:58:06] <am_omega> Even if you ally with him.
[1:58:09] <dds333a> @sweetangy021 yeah, spelled differently and everything
[1:58:17] <maskedmook> I think the Raidou games are my favorite PS2 era SMT games
[1:58:17] <skagtheprinceofhell> More square face
[1:58:18] <+StreamingInVain> Ohshit! It's Archer himself!
[1:58:19] <cardamomo88> LUL LUL
[1:58:19] <DSD24> Older Jack
[1:58:19] <+Arek_1> LUL
[1:58:20] <+TenWren> the squarest jaw in the world
[1:58:20] <ExpressNode> Every old man voice sounds like they're one step from the grave and becoming a demon themselves
[1:58:20] <%meniscate> I think there's literally an ICBM named Thor
[1:58:20] <xeros720> we're already in the past
[1:58:21] <dds333a> @am_shigar00 of course, gotta get rid of the demons
[1:58:22] <BlackermanZX> Jack really let himself go
[1:58:23] <Dakuu75> Not off
[1:58:24] <am_omega> He is just like "Sick, well two bombs were not enough"
[1:58:25] <skagtheprinceofhell> Instead of rectangle
[1:58:27] <Applecannon63> Ace attourney Cross examination
[1:58:28] <am_omega> and then panic
[1:58:35] <DSD24> He left out the part where Raidou got his ass kicked
[1:58:42] <dds333a> The Great Destruction has to come
[1:58:43] <%Sweetangy021> @dds333a Oh yeah Gouto vs Gotou
[1:58:48] <+Ganmorg> Hey Woolie what demons you got yet
[1:58:49] <Parapattern> Professor Utonium lookin ass
[1:58:55] <+Ganmorg> Never played Raidou before
[1:59:01] <Applecannon63> Jack but not a Professor
[1:59:02] <%meniscate> Ah, the Daidoji Zaibatsu
[1:59:09] <dds333a> He's rolling with three demons, so far
[1:59:24] <CatRidder> no, my name is jojo
[1:59:26] <dds333a> An Ukobach, Alp, and one cute as hell Obariyon
[1:59:32] <andre11dr> Man i would love if we got Dagda as a summoneble demon in V
[1:59:32] <skagtheprinceofhell> Right, then we just demon magic the old man
[1:59:47] <andre11dr> Dagda looks so fucking cool
[1:59:48] <ExpressNode> I need to get around to this game. Bought it but never started it on my PS3
[1:59:53] <%Fabpsi_> horny bonk
[1:59:55] <Leddy_at_Home> @andre11dr They ARE putting story important demons from other games in V, more specifically SJ
[1:59:59] <Leddy_at_Home> Like Demeter and Anahita
[2:00:08] <%meniscate> Yamaoka BibleThump Kreygasm Kreygasm
[2:00:10] <Leddy_at_Home> So Dagda and maybe even Krishna might appear in SMT V
[2:00:12] <dds333a> no wonder
[2:00:16] <WeijiBeng> jonzheLASER I want agony back
[2:00:18] <maskedmook> @andre11dr if they do he for sure wont be the same as in Apocalypse design wise
[2:00:19] <%ekodrop> murder nakamura
[2:00:19] <cardamomo88> SUS
[2:00:19] <am_omega> @ExpressNode When you do check out the debug code to turn off Vsync so it runs better.
[2:00:19] <%heartlesshealer> still mad about loli demeter
[2:00:20] <Am_Shigar00> I would love to see Krishna again.
[2:00:22] <Leddy_at_Home> Odin was the first one confirmed to be in
[2:00:23] <+Ganmorg> Dagda and Krishna would be cool as bonus bosses
[2:00:24] <Leddy_at_Home> Sooooo
[2:00:25] <dds333a> @meniscate rip to a real one
[2:00:25] <saiyanblitz> Hi everybody
[2:00:34] <DSD24> Hiya!
[2:00:41] <BlacSoul> read his bitch ass butler mind
[2:00:42] <dbag202> OLD
[2:00:43] <+Ganmorg> Have we even seen Odin in V aside from the reveal?
[2:00:49] <%meniscate> @dds333a still my favorite persona
[2:00:50] <Am_Shigar00> I don't think we have
[2:00:51] <ExpressNode> @am_omega Yeah I saw that video on twitter and bookmarked it so I can remember how to do it
[2:00:57] <+Ganmorg> I thought he was a standin for Aogami
[2:00:57] <dds333a> LUL LUL LUL
[2:00:59] <Leddy_at_Home> @Ganmorg Not yet
[2:00:59] <skagtheprinceofhell> @Ganmorg No but we know he's in
[2:00:59] <andre11dr> Yeah I'm so glad they went with the SMT 4 Odin
[2:01:03] <DSD24> Nah that's Devil Survivor
[2:01:03] <time_axis> Devil Survivor is that
[2:01:04] <+CaptainJax> That's devil survivor
[2:01:06] <Qu1ckyyy> That's Devil Survivor
[2:01:07] <dds333a> Survivor, yeah
[2:01:10] <Applecannon63> STAKE OUT
[2:01:10] <maskedmook> Devil Survivor is the tactical rpg
[2:01:10] <am_omega> Devil Survivor is the tactical game.
[2:01:13] <turboyabo> because devil survivor
[2:01:13] <cardamomo88> survivor
[2:01:13] <BurdRightsActivist> Devil Survivor
[2:01:14] <%Sweetangy021> @WoolieVersus Thats Majin nsei or Devil Survivor
[2:01:15] <Leddy_at_Home> That's Devil Survivor and Majin Tensei
[2:01:18] <%heartlesshealer> Devil Survivor
[2:01:20] <Am_Shigar00> That's Devil Survivor. I do get the titles mixed up myself
[2:01:20] <am_omega> Same with Majin Tensei.
[2:01:25] <pacibuddy> music is bopping
[2:01:26] <Blank9> yeah, the Devil Survivor games on DS are tactical RPGs
[2:01:27] <andre11dr> I always thought that Naked Purple Odin looked super lame
[2:01:31] <dds333a> Yeah, Majin Tensei  too
[2:01:34] <Zeppelee> Devil Survivor gameplay.
[2:01:35] <maskedmook> Devil Survivor are the best SMT games
[2:01:36] <Iam_Dead> devil survivor is that
[2:01:36] <deagles6> Devil Survivor is cool
[2:01:36] <am_omega> Also shout outs to the second Majin Tensei game, SPIRAL NEMESIS
[2:01:38] <Dakuu75> @WoolieVersus You might be thinking of "Eternal Poison" (PS2)
[2:01:38] <Leddy_at_Home> Devil Survivor is more Fire Emblem, Majim Tensei is more Advanced War
[2:01:39] <ChouGokuOozaru> was gonna say, that's more Majin Tensei
[2:01:40] <%elderpunch> he was thinking devil survivor lmaoo
[2:01:41] <dds333a> Yep
[2:01:44] <+bullprophet> there are so many more
[2:01:45] <+CaptainJax> devil survivor are real cool
[2:01:45] <JOJOHNNY135> That’s Devil Survivor and bits of SMT Nine
[2:01:46] <turboyabo> those two games have there own series
[2:01:47] <alrobot2014> SMT series names are easy to fuck up
[2:01:51] <BurdRightsActivist> Devil Summoner, Devil Survivor, Devil Saga
[2:01:52] <+Ganmorg> The worst part is that Devil Summoner is just DS and Devil Survivor is abbreviated to DeSu
[2:01:56] <Am_Shigar00> We've got action rpgs, traditional RPGs, strategy, life sims, it's a broad series.
[2:01:59] <+Ganmorg> When they're the same abbreviation
[2:02:02] <skagtheprinceofhell> Gouto, your a cat, you go in
[2:02:02] <StarlitStunner> Devil Saga baby!
[2:02:09] <Hippoleon> Devil Summoner has a couple separate categories, Survivor only has 2 games that each have a remake
[2:02:14] <ExpressNode> I have the devil survivor games but only have 2 on physical
[2:02:22] <%meniscate> Alp Kreygasm Kreygasm
[2:02:23] <Am_Shigar00> This is one of the coolest mechanics in this game.
[2:02:24] <WeijiBeng> ok how about a Devil summoner by the yakuza team jonzheLASER
[2:02:29] <dds333a> @burdrightsactivist and Digital Devil Saga is already referencing Digital devil story LUL
[2:02:31] <skagtheprinceofhell> TIme to use our ghost
[2:02:33] <+CaptainJax> Sheer Heart Alp has no weakness
[2:02:34] <+Ganmorg> idk guys this music is giving me kinda Pursowner vibes :^)
[2:02:36] <Applecannon63> The 3 DS Devil Saga Devil Summoner and Devil Survivor
[2:02:38] <+bullprophet> I think I still have survivor sitting in an old ds case on my shelf somewhere.
[2:02:41] <darkfox1995> Devil Survivor is some good shit and banging music
[2:02:42] <turboyabo> this is what capcom took from us the swagger of raidou
[2:02:49] <am_omega> Yo I would be down for a modern Devil Summoner by the Yakuza team.
[2:02:54] <andre11dr> RIP
[2:03:00] <linSP> lotta devil games
[2:03:00] <+Ganmorg> I gotta play this game sometime
[2:03:03] <xeros720> i recommend Obariyon since i think his normal attack is better
[2:03:09] <andre11dr> Oh wait he figured it out
[2:03:12] <Applecannon63> wut!?
[2:03:12] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1423196401152974850?s=19
[2:03:13] <+Ganmorg> Digital Devil Story and Digital Devil Saga
[2:03:15] <skagtheprinceofhell> Wow, you can spam magic in this
[2:03:15] <+o_almighty_1> What I miss?
[2:03:22] <+Dova573> Fuck it I want Ichiban to start in his own SMT game
[2:03:23] <maskedmook> this is one of my favorite battle themes it's so good
[2:03:24] <WeijiBeng> am_omega its so close that it cannot miss
[2:03:26] <RaiNiMayonnaise> it is
[2:03:27] <+Captain_Spicy_> what's the distance on that attack? lol
[2:03:32] <RaiNiMayonnaise> demon attacks are stiff
[2:03:33] <Zeppelee> Raidou is basically a Japanese Batman in the early 1900's.
[2:03:34] <dds333a> @skagtheprinceofhell yep. MP permitting
[2:03:35] <turboyabo> every animation is differnt and the range is different
[2:03:35] <am_omega> Like no Judgement games anymore.
[2:03:42] <am_omega> So make them Devil Summoner games.
[2:03:44] <Am_Shigar00> I think everyone has functionally identical physical attacks, but the animation cohesion varies
[2:03:47] <dds333a> her normal attack is EXTREMELY up close
[2:03:47] <andre11dr> Obariyon would definitely make this easier
[2:03:48] <am_omega> with a Kuzunoha.
[2:04:01] <JOJOHNNY135> Alp mainly just heals, she’s for support
[2:04:03] <TheDwarvenBard> Some of the COMPs in Imagine are like hardlight constructs of books and they're named Digital Devil Scriptures
[2:04:04] <%LastHazzerd> using demons for infeltration? this is cool
[2:04:07] <dds333a> @am_shigar00 yeah. only really distance changes
[2:04:08] <TheDwarvenBard> and I am there for that
[2:04:15] <+aBoner89> You're gonna et soo many spiders
[2:04:18] <turboyabo> yet woolie sucks using obariyon
[2:04:18] <+JupiterDjin> If he's anything like Woodhouse he's off shooting heroin
[2:04:24] <dds333a> good to have
[2:04:30] <DSD24> The camera's that steal your soul
[2:04:31] <%diegobandzz> Idk if the grade sand…..
[2:04:32] <dds333a> the ones that destroy the bulbs
[2:04:35] <+Dova573> also can people see demons besides raidou?
[2:04:35] <DSD24> Like Camera Obscura!
[2:04:38] <%diegobandzz> But coarse
[2:04:39] <WeijiBeng> Imagine is such a mysterious game I love it
[2:04:42] <andre11dr> Atllus could let the Yakuza team do a game
[2:04:43] <+Dova573> or are we on stand rules
[2:04:45] <%meniscate> That's 100% a Camera obscura photo
[2:04:49] <Zeppelee> Atom Heart Father attacks!
[2:04:50] <am_omega> @Dova573 very few.
[2:04:54] <turboyabo> no only certain type of people can see demons
[2:04:56] <dds333a> @dova573 only if the summoner permits
[2:04:58] <am_omega> Mostly stand rules.
[2:05:01] <andre11dr> Isn't Atllus pretty much owned by SEGA?
[2:05:09] <deagles6> Ichiban can mostly see demons
[2:05:10] <dds333a> and usually most people can't see it, but some can
[2:05:10] <skagtheprinceofhell> @andre11dr Yes
[2:05:11] <Am_Shigar00> I wouldn't mind a Raidou in the style of P5 strikers either.
[2:05:11] <am_omega> Yes SEGA owns Atlus now.
[2:05:13] <%diegobandzz> What’s up with that cape?
[2:05:16] <Zeppelee> @andre11dr Yep.
[2:05:18] <deagles6> because of Yakuza 7
[2:05:37] <Phob05> The cape is for style but it also covers his weapons
[2:05:37] <skagtheprinceofhell> Should have thought of that before becoming old
[2:05:41] <ExpressNode> When did Sega buy Atlus?  I know its been a while
[2:05:42] <%meniscate> maid Kreygasm Kreygasm
[2:05:43] <Leddy_at_Home> The director of the Raidou games recently said that he would like to make more Raidou games, soooo
[2:05:45] <Leddy_at_Home> We don't know
[2:05:48] <am_omega> They just did.
[2:05:54] <Leddy_at_Home> Maybe we can get Raidou remakes soon
[2:06:04] <+bullprophet> I'd kill for ports so many of these old megaten games. remember strange journey? let's get strange journey again
[2:06:04] <DSD24> It'd be cool if the next Raidou was a lady
[2:06:08] <ExpressNode> Oh fuck it was 2013
[2:06:08] <turboyabo> thsega bought atlus a year after persona 5 came out
[2:06:19] <BlacSoul> a buck?
[2:06:22] <DSD24> @bullprophet Strange Journey got Redux at least
[2:06:22] <%moonmintparadise> THE OL FISH EYE
[2:06:22] <cardamomo88> LUL
[2:06:25] <WeijiBeng> strange got rereleased on the 3ds
[2:06:28] <CatRidder> fiish
[2:06:28] <skagtheprinceofhell> I mean, this is like the 20's
[2:06:29] <+Ganmorg> @DSD24 We're getting close to Atlus having a female protag as the default
[2:06:30] <dds333a> on the take
[2:06:32] <+Ganmorg> slowly but surely
[2:06:32] <%Irridium> for "services"
[2:06:34] <cardamomo88> fish
[2:06:35] <%meniscate> @dsd24 One of the other Kuzunohas is a woman I think
[2:06:35] <dds333a> for a pittance
[2:06:36] <am_omega> Yeah I would love Strange Journey to get ported. No there was no re-release with Space Yukiko.
[2:06:40] <Dr_Mooose> don't spend it all in one place
[2:06:43] <am_omega> Nope I refuse.
[2:06:46] <%heartlesshealer> a single bullet is only 30 yen, 100 is a good bribe
[2:06:48] <Phob05> A few Kuzunoha's where women
[2:06:48] <TheDwarvenBard> Yeah there's a lady Kuzunoha in DS2
[2:06:51] <skagtheprinceofhell> Right? This is around the 20's right?
[2:06:51] <+bullprophet> @DSD24 yeah, gotta hunt down a 3DS for it. so not terrible, but PC or switch would be great
[2:06:53] <andre11dr> So yeah the could let the Yakuza team go nuts with a Raidou games, but then again a Hokuto no Ken game also sounded rad and then THAT happened ans everyone seems to forget about it immediately LUL
[2:06:53] <linSP> 100 was probably worth more
[2:07:02] <TheDwarvenBard> And at least one other in the manga
[2:07:06] <%LastHazzerd> 20s or 30s i forget
[2:07:07] <Joestar1890> tbf, 1 dollars was probably alot in the 30's
[2:07:14] <dds333a> ueah, she's in training in the sequel
[2:07:17] <%heartlesshealer> taisho era, it was a lot
[2:07:18] <am_omega> The Kuzunoha chick in 2 is kinda cute tho.
[2:07:30] <%LastHazzerd> i don't actually know what the Yen was worth compared to the american dollar throughout history
[2:07:31] <DSD24> Only issue I have with Redux is that I wish it got a dub
[2:07:41] <WeijiBeng> They didnt flash out shin's fight on hokuto no ken game jonzheJOKER
[2:07:46] <+tigerfang86> monkaS

[2:09:58] <%meniscate> this is a Tarantino angle
[2:09:58] <CatRidder> A DOLAR
[2:09:59] <dds333a> on account of Raidou being a boring self-insert, in true SMT fashion
[2:10:03] <skagtheprinceofhell> So we use DEMON MAGIC YES?
[2:10:04] <+bullprophet> I just love strange journey's aesthetics.  those suits are weird looking and I dig it
[2:10:14] <am_omega> I am still looking how to mod Doom so I can just make Strange Journey in the Doom engine.

[2:10:33] <neodunks> Yo wtf, I never expected you to play an SMT game LUL
[2:10:38] <TheDwarvenBard> Strange Journey has the best "you are fucked now" boss music
[2:10:41] <Leddy_at_Home> We need an actual SMTxFE, TMS was......
[2:10:44] <cardamomo88> LUL LUL
[2:10:48] <dds333a> didn't work out LUL
[2:10:54] <andre11dr> That game plays great ,cool story, FUCKING AWESOME SETTING
[2:10:56] <neodunks> @leddy_at_home that would be devil survivor
[2:10:57] <skagtheprinceofhell> @Leddy_at_Home All your getting
[2:10:59] <%skeletonman9000> strange journey and smt4a are my favorites
[2:11:04] <Leddy_at_Home> Yeah
[2:11:06] <am_omega> Damn I gotta go tho, will definitely check out the vods.
[2:11:12] <Leddy_at_Home> Devil Survivor is the true SMTxFE

[2:11:17] <dds333a> @am_omega later
[2:11:20] <neodunks> Devil survivor is literally just a fire emblem game with demons and rpg combat
[2:11:28] <dds333a> His bro
[2:11:31] <Am_Shigar00> I honestly never really got the connection. It really doesn't play at all like Fire Emblem other than being a strategy game.
[2:11:32] <+relentingapunch> Yo devil survivor?
[2:11:34] <WeijiBeng> If only right... they decided to breed "at the time" two of the underated series. and persona got the best of us again
[2:11:44] <Am_Shigar00> Still a solid game though, even if it's not quite my cup of tea
[2:11:48] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> devil survivor OC needs a port
[2:11:56] <cardamomo88> your nice KATAS
[2:11:57] <WeijiBeng> its something like SMT vs Makai Kingdom or something but then it becomes Dimension neptunia
[2:12:03] <+FerdytheNerdy> @yaboi_raidshadowlegends facts
[2:12:12] <%Josef_Stryker> Phrasing

[2:12:14] <CatRidder> swinging your sword around
[2:12:16] <+bullprophet> devil survivor's combat is FE-like but I really don't remember the relationship building  being nearly as in-depth as an FE game
[2:12:16] <%Sweetangy021> Isn't it like you getting pulled into an alt dimensions
[2:12:20] <Phob05> Raidou swinging at the air and some weird hobos
[2:12:26] <%meniscate> @yaboi_raidshadowlegends just play it on your modded 3ds
[2:12:31] <dds333a> yep
[2:12:35] <turboyabo> yeah you disapper into thin air

[2:12:41] <yeildingthought> LUL
[2:12:41] <dds333a> mix and match
[2:12:45] <andre11dr> Also Strange Journey has some really cool demons that only appear in that game like The Black Madonna, which is basically just fight Virgin Mary as a boss

[2:13:27] <TheDwarvenBard> Black Maria actually showed up in Imagine
[2:13:32] <emptyantics> RACIAL PINNACLE
[2:13:32] <turboyabo> like they even show you exactly what happens by looking at a civilian
[2:13:33] <MisterCrimson> @andre11dr Black Maria, as she is sometimes called, is a major antagonist of SMT NINE
[2:13:45] <skagtheprinceofhell> Alchemy
[2:13:49] <DSD24> The Necronomicon?
[2:13:52] <Joestar1890> In Japan
[2:13:53] <dds333a> man, who knows?
[2:13:53] <WeijiBeng> and there's black maria on Imagine online
[2:13:55] <%AlteisenReiseZ> The "Help"
[2:14:09] <Darren716> Yo what's this book about China saying?
[2:14:29] <skagtheprinceofhell> Large cash hide outs. Dirty on every other noble near you. A family registry and a bunch of dirt on the house your in
[2:14:35] <linSP> squeak btw
[2:14:40] <DSD24> SMT Nine has 9 different playthoughs
[2:14:43] <andre11dr> Is NINE good?
[2:14:43] <dds333a> how nice
[2:14:44] <TheDwarvenBard> Black Maria was amazing in Imagine, since she had a passive ability while summoned that gave the player +30% elemental damage/+2000 limit break cap
[2:14:57] <Am_Shigar00> that sounds disgustingly broken
[2:15:03] <WeijiBeng> Is Nine unplayable thats the question jonzheJOKER
[2:15:07] <andre11dr> What even is NINE is it like regular SMTs ?
[2:15:14] <DSD24> I heard NINE was cool but I only watched the Neutral Playthrough on Youtube
[2:15:22] <TheDwarvenBard> Considering she was a pain in the ass to unlock for fusion and then to fuse, it's fitting
[2:15:23] <Yomigami> There will never be a Raidou 3 ResidentSleeper
[2:15:28] <dds333a> @andre11dr not, entirely?
[2:15:32] <Am_Shigar00> If I recall, NINE was one of their first attempts at a full 3D SMT game and was meant to tie into an MMO or something like that.
[2:15:38] <%LastHazzerd> i like Obariyon's idle animation
[2:15:39] <dds333a> NINE was the first next gen 3d game
[2:15:42] <WeijiBeng> Open your eyes Atlus been lying to you Ronde Tensei is mainline SMT
[2:15:52] <DSD24> @LastHazzerd He's doing a cute jig

[2:18:11] <andre11dr> Elmo?
[2:18:12] <MisterCrimson> NINE is....different. It follows a chapter structure, and "level" is determined by what gems you equip. Also, there are really long, and poorly explained RTS sections. Story is interesting as it takes place in that time span between the nukes and when Hero escapes Kongo-Kai

[2:22:45] <BurdRightsActivist> GUESS I'LL DIE.
[2:22:49] <BloomingVillain> wait wait wait, woolie vs WHAT
[2:22:50] <+xerotwo> The pains of being a IIDX player LUL
[2:22:50] <+musmayrelchup> crap whats the clip called? i want to look it up, i missed the name of the game
[2:23:00] <Dakuu75> anyone got a link to that one?
[2:23:05] <algi80> hello all PrideLionHey
[2:23:05] <%heartlesshealer> beatmania or one of those types of games
[2:23:29] <dds333a> yep
[2:23:34] <+xerotwo> I do have a link to it LUL
[2:23:35] <DSD24> Look up sasoribi on youtube
[2:23:35] <Hoaxfish> the goilden child
[2:23:37] <dds333a> the kid animates a coke can
[2:23:46] <+xerotwo> just search Sasoribi
[2:23:54] <vapelad_dabberb01> finally, a real smt game
[2:23:55] <dds333a> no, wait, pepsi
[2:23:57] <Mr_Zero5232> The Golden Child?
[2:24:00] <andre11dr> Much like Golden Child the rapper, old and bad LUL
[2:24:08] <@Menitta> I missed the start. What exactly is the...premise of this game
[2:24:11] <dds333a> I don't fucking know, movie sucks
[2:24:22] <cardamomo88> LUL LUL
[2:24:22] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:24:24] <andre11dr> @menitta Demon Pokemon
[2:24:35] <Mr_Zero5232> Yeah it’s the Golden Child, movie is tresh
[2:24:39] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> during 1920s Japan
[2:24:39] <BurdRightsActivist> @Menitta SMT but you're a detective in Imperial Japan. Your demons are your pokemon/digimon partners
[2:24:39] <BrvldrHungryHeart> its SMT, but somehow its also RE detective
[2:24:43] <DSD24> @Menitta We are playing as a Detective
[2:24:45] <%Prevot> oh boy
[2:24:47] <%livlinn> LUL
[2:25:00] <+FerdytheNerdy> Ouran high school host demon
[2:25:05] <turboyabo> 1 dose no hold handing but 2 tho it makes sure to hold your hand
[2:25:14] <Applecannon63> the horny girls
[2:25:15] <@Menitta> Ok detective. I knew its SMT stuff but I didnt know that's what Raidou is
[2:25:20] <@Menitta> Cool! Thanks
[2:25:26] <+razorgem> @WoolieVersus how do you feel about SFV luke  ?
[2:25:27] <BrvldrHungryHeart> dunno why, but raido 1 always felt like a survival horror, only the horror is poverty
[2:25:29] <andre11dr> This is really just Pokemon and Onimusha mashed together
[2:25:42] <andre11dr> But like Onimusha 1
[2:25:54] <vapelad_dabberb01> megaten predates pokemon by a few years
[2:25:59] <dds333a> @menitta The Kuzunoha family has protected Japan for centuries. as the latest in that line, the 13th, it now falls to Raidou. early in his tenure as an investigator, a girl named Kaya Daidouji goes missing, after relaying cryptic news, now they're looming for her
[2:26:01] <Applecannon63> its ace attourney with pokemon mechanics but star ocean combat
[2:26:02] <BurdRightsActivist> @BrvldrHungryHeart So like real life? 4Head
[2:26:18] <skagtheprinceofhell> Ah yes, let us perform heresy in a church with the organs playing
[2:26:26] <+xerotwo> So yes, that was the Sasoribi Incident LUL
[2:26:38] <dds333a> hey. it's not actually a church LUL
[2:26:41] <cardamomo88> heal??
[2:26:46] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @burdrightsactivist lmfao OOF
[2:26:52] <andre11dr> Reroll those skills
[2:26:55] <%livlinn> SabaPing
[2:26:56] <turboyabo> you have to take into the count the seach things wont change
[2:27:01] <Qu1ckyyy> She*
[2:27:04] <andre11dr> 9000 rerolls later
[2:27:12] <skagtheprinceofhell> I know, but that just means they got a pipe organ from a church and just jamming out on it in the background as he experiments
[2:27:16] <RaiNiMayonnaise> MAG is for summoning
[2:27:19] <BrvldrHungryHeart> @burdrightsactivist Yes, but im stuck with useless demons that spend most Of their time stuck in animations in battle while i tickle the enemy to death
[2:27:20] <andre11dr> You got bright might
[2:27:20] <Applecannon63> rip Alp
[2:27:24] <BurdRightsActivist> Ah yes, PS2 Megaten rerolling NotLikeThis
[2:27:30] <Am_Shigar00> Ahh, the days of random rerolls
[2:27:32] <Qu1ckyyy> Yep it's random but at least it's only 4
[2:27:32] <DSD24> Mash those buttons
[2:27:35] <andre11dr> YEYEYEYE
[2:27:44] <dds333a> Also, this game takes place in an alternate Japan, where rapid technological developments happened much earlier, this naturally clashes with the more traditional aspects of life
[2:27:46] <andre11dr> Get ready for 900000000 rerolls
[2:27:48] <BlackermanZX> oh boy LUL
[2:27:50] <DSD24> Its way easier since its 4
[2:27:51] <%livlinn> OhMyDog OhMyDog OhMyDog
[2:27:52] <turboyabo> its simple rng that not really should gripe about
[2:28:03] <%kewlmyc> You picked an old ass game, it's to be expected
[2:28:05] <skagtheprinceofhell> Wait... why even make it RNG if you can do it like this and just keep pressing for the stuff you want and have free rerolls?
[2:28:05] <Broand> Also your world abilities are gonna be different too
[2:28:08] <dundore77> at least you dont have to make it then see the skills
[2:28:11] <dds333a> @turboyabo honestly
[2:28:11] <Phob05> Some fusion summons are fixed
[2:28:13] <JetpackMcQuack> But pride and accomplishment
[2:28:13] <BrvldrHungryHeart> i miss the random skill inheritance....
[2:28:15] <Am_Shigar00> Won't lie, SMT III HD adding in manual selection was the nail that encouraged me to pick it up
[2:28:16] <quietshun> Does it even matter as much in this game tho, since it's action
[2:28:17] <tentavision> im the kind of guy who can't settle, I've spent literal hours just resetting for optimal fusions
[2:28:25] <andre11dr> It literally took me 3 hours to fuse my endgame demons in SMT 3
[2:28:29] <skagtheprinceofhell> @BrvldrHungryHeart Said no one and that's why we save scum
[2:28:43] <cardamomo88> LUL LUL
[2:28:47] <alexandrecau> bufu wreacks lifu
[2:28:51] <%Prevot> so much for 40.hours
[2:28:53] <BurdRightsActivist> @Am_Shigar00 Same. It's so much better
[2:28:59] <andre11dr> You'll eventually have to farm it Woolie
[2:29:02] <+relentingapunch> Fusion optimization resets are time sinks
[2:29:03] <turboyabo> ooooh its not easily handed to me
[2:29:04] <Phob05> There's a priority system so some skills have less of a change to be inherited
[2:29:05] <Calamity2007> This is probably the biggest thing that is keeping me from revisiting the old games
[2:29:11] <DSD24> Now we got a cool Merman
[2:29:11] <+unfortunatpanda> critroleHellobees jocatBEES jocatBEES critroleHellobees
[2:29:21] <+relentingapunch> 100%
[2:29:21] <BrvldrHungryHeart> @skagtheprinceofhell i miss the time i spent Hours trying to get an optimal skillset, its kinda relaxing...
[2:29:24] <Am_Shigar00> they're totally cool with it
[2:29:25] <Mattais88> Frankenstein?
[2:29:25] <cardamomo88> CONSENSUAL
[2:29:26] <%Fabpsi_> how deep underground is this basement?
[2:29:27] <+relentingapunch> YO
[2:29:30] <xeros720> that's why you have to max loyalty first
[2:29:31] <dbag202> Voluntary cages

[2:29:38] <%meniscate> Aquaman
[2:29:47] <alexandrecau> Sen fortress
[2:29:48] <skagtheprinceofhell> SO like... we have bigger demons then that cage can hold.
[2:29:48] <BurdRightsActivist> That's a GOOD animation, holy shit
[2:29:48] <BlackermanZX> behold a fish
[2:29:50] <dds333a> It totally is tho LUL
[2:29:50] <+TenWren> ukobach was a real one :(

[2:30:04] <%heartlesshealer> this Azumi got the grandma soul
[2:30:06] <Am_Shigar00> I love the demon personalties.
[2:30:13] <DSD24> Megami's are cool ladies
[2:30:13] <JetpackMcQuack> Some of them really like you
[2:30:17] <+FuqBoiSlim> Some of them are just Scooby Doo
[2:30:19] <andre11dr> Some of them are really stuffy
[2:30:22] <dds333a> some TaLK LikE ThIs
[2:30:31] <Am_Shigar00> oh hey, Izanagi lore, nice.
[2:30:33] <DSD24> Some are just slime
[2:30:33] <Calamity2007> @DSD24 Megami literally means Goddess if I am correct
[2:30:36] <skagtheprinceofhell> I know if would be way to much to do but it would be fun if you could more easily just keep the demons you like based on look and personality
[2:30:37] <+relentingapunch> Nice to me-heet you, ho
[2:30:49] <skagtheprinceofhell> @Calamity2007 It does
[2:30:50] <dundore77> is this the same demon gain like SMT3 or persona series? where you just have to figure out how a word is rude or timid that doesn't translate into english
[2:30:51] <%meniscate> Probably the dopest ancestors you could have
[2:30:55] <Phob05> This game also has oboroguruma who is my favorite demon
[2:31:03] <Am_Shigar00> @skagtheprinceofhell Certain games do let you pull it off. Not easily, but possible.
[2:31:06] <DSD24> @Calamity2007 I'm pretty sure you are correct
[2:31:09] <cardamomo88> catch another
[2:31:13] <dds333a> @dundore77 no
[2:31:20] <Applecannon63> this Izanagi born kami by taking a bath
[2:31:34] <BurdRightsActivist> My ancestor was said to have fuckin zord battles with Kaiju beaver, it's fucking dope

[2:31:48] <%meniscate> dirty dirty Izanagi boi
[2:31:48] <+TenWren> needing to fuse my favorite demons was the hurdle i had to overcome to enjoy this series
[2:31:53] <Am_Shigar00> yeah, just to open up space.
[2:31:56] <andre11dr> Actually i just remember, this game has my favorite version of Susano
[2:32:00] <cardamomo88> yes
[2:32:01] <%heartlesshealer> to free slot, but you could always just fuse to open up space

[2:34:25] <%he1lhydra> ayo? woolieKICKDAD
[2:34:28] <Phob05> You need to use the dev commands to make it run correctly though
[2:34:34] <andre11dr> Actually i forget, how do Mudo spells work in this game ?
[2:34:36] <skagtheprinceofhell> Oh, he's pretty big from what I thought
[2:34:42] <BurdRightsActivist> @turboyabo The PS3 Store versions of Raidou 1 and DDS are kinda borked, but someone just discovered a dev code -THIS YEAR- which disables the v-sync on un-modded systems and it runs like butter
[2:34:42] <turboyabo> then the supior version for this series should be ps3
[2:34:43] <xeros720> the "deal"
[2:34:43] <DSD24> Strangely Attractive for a fishman
[2:34:50] <Am_Shigar00> @andre11dr I think Mudo is percent damage in this game?
[2:34:50] <BrvldrHungryHeart> mudo is still instadeath
[2:34:54] <BelMadness> wow, playing Raidou? nice
[2:34:55] <dds333a> @andre11dr they just cause big damage, and have a special ailment

[2:37:43] <+CzarinaXANA> Zootopia was for the zoomers
[2:37:44] <dds333a> clearly
[2:37:46] <%elderpunch> blame disney, dreamworks.etc
[2:37:46] <+zanz_san> Blame Bugs Bunny
[2:37:49] <drunken_lemur> Blue nose?
[2:37:51] <BurdRightsActivist> -Flashback of running around in a circle inside the tower of katasuchi for a full moon-
[2:37:54] <Am_Shigar00> Tohsaka?
[2:37:58] <Jeemukun> bluenose? she's from nova scotia?
[2:38:04] <DSD24> I wish it was Tohsaka
[2:38:07] <teefpal> Des-zert
[2:38:08] <+Arek_1> A blue nose causes blue balls. LUL
[2:38:08] <+Dova573> "Desert"
[2:38:10] <+haitakaa> blue nose? she into dat smurf ass?
[2:38:12] <%Zero_Jacks> bluenose ?
[2:38:16] <maskedmook> OST for this game is so good
[2:38:27] <+zanz_san> R. Crumb said Bugs dressing as Marilyn Monroe was a big inspiration
[2:38:45] <skagtheprinceofhell> Look at all that blood
[2:38:45] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:38:59] <brachydios777> When is voice acting for characters?
[2:39:01] <dds333a> @zanz_san In back in action? LUL
[2:39:01] <Hippoleon> It's random
[2:39:03] <cardamomo88> depends
[2:39:03] <BlackermanZX> you can order them so they dont use MP right
[2:39:07] <Am_Shigar00> it's a random bonus
[2:39:10] <andre11dr> But actually you should blame our past as furry monkeys
[2:39:11] <skagtheprinceofhell> This game has voice acting?
[2:39:15] <DSD24> There is no voice acting
[2:39:15] <RaiNiMayonnaise> You can command them to conserve MP
[2:39:21] <DSD24> This lady looks intense
[2:39:21] <dds333a> only demons have voices
[2:39:28] <%Prevot> NECC
[2:39:29] <+zanz_san> R. Crumb made Fritz the Cat
[2:39:31] <BurdRightsActivist> Squall.
[2:39:33] <dds333a> the rest is text
[2:39:37] <Phob05> The devs said they didn't voice anyone because they wanted it to be more like a silent film but IDK about that.
[2:39:53] <%townzzzzz> SMT neck
[2:39:54] <xeros720> that fate stay night neck
[2:39:54] <skagtheprinceofhell> It's a thick neck
[2:39:55] <andre11dr> I don't buy that
[2:39:55] <BelMadness> shit thats a long neck
[2:39:55] <Darren716> Could pick apples with that thing
[2:39:57] <+TenWren> cool
[2:39:58] <Am_Shigar00> I bet it was just a budget constraint, I heard this game didn't have the biggest budget
[2:39:59] <Dr_Mooose> see ya
[2:40:00] <cardamomo88> VOID
[2:40:02] <+FuqBoiSlim> Kaneko Neck KEKW
[2:40:02] <BurdRightsActivist> EB GAMES NECK
[2:40:04] <dds333a> @blackermanzx yeah, and you really should, because these demons will just blow all their MP
[2:40:04] <FassieFons> swallowed by her own neck
[2:40:05] <%Sweetangy021> Spirited away
[2:40:06] <%heartlesshealer> G O N E
[2:40:06] <skagtheprinceofhell> Ah, spirited away, time to go through that to!
[2:40:10] <andre11dr> SNT 3 original was also not voice
[2:40:11] <%Prevot> LUL
[2:40:16] <turboyabo> yep you see that what happen to people who go to the dark realm
[2:40:17] <KyberNasse> NOPE
[2:40:17] <cardamomo88> bye felicia
[2:40:20] <+theoldone001> Go save that neck boy
[2:40:20] <+aBoner89> monkaS
[2:40:25] <DSD24> Oh god not the Nioh 2 Dark Realm
[2:40:25] <BurdRightsActivist> SHADOW REALM
[2:40:27] <Darren716> She got banished to the shadow realm
[2:40:29] <xeros720> ahaha, time to go to the shadow realm Raidou!
[2:40:29] <+relentingapunch> M. Shanota shrine
[2:40:31] <turboyabo> banished to the shadow realm
[2:40:35] <dds333a> @phob05 SMT wasn't really doing vA before this abyway
[2:40:35] <Joestar1890> M. Shinoda?
[2:40:38] <teefpal> very videogame
[2:40:45] <Phob05> Correct
[2:40:45] <Joestar1890> Mike Shinoda has his own shrine?
[2:40:53] <cardamomo88> LUL LUL
[2:40:54] <%heartlesshealer> It's that classic L-shaped ghost alley too
[2:41:21] <Am_Shigar00> They'd probably add Voice Acting to a rerelease. It's like the thing they do in every single major updated release.

[2:41:24] <andre11dr> The Raidou games do feel lower budget than something like SMT 3 or DDS
[2:41:30] <+Ganmorg> DDS was the first megaten with voice acting right?
[2:41:41] <andre11dr> There's a lot of cut corners
[2:41:41] <+Ganmorg> Not bad for their first go
[2:41:44] <dds333a> @ganmorg Full, yes, I think
[2:41:44] <skagtheprinceofhell> Which is ironic cause it's an action game
[2:41:54] <turboyabo> hongo isnt a place yet
[2:41:57] <DSD24> DDS is really cool
[2:42:07] <Fruity86__> Is it still that light in montreal at 7pm?
[2:42:08] <turboyabo> it dosent even exist yet
[2:42:10] <Am_Shigar00> It's especially blatent with the demon combat animations. Those attacks weren't built with an action RPG in mind.
[2:42:11] <dds333a> DDS is the BEST
[2:42:14] <+chiazam> What came first, Nocturne or this game?
[2:42:18] <andre11dr> DDS is really cool but also has grinding problems
[2:42:19] <iacus_> Just caught up on DIsco. How's the SMT going?
[2:42:22] <BelMadness> makes sense
[2:42:31] <turboyabo> this game came first
[2:42:31] <BrvldrHungryHeart> dds is cool, but you have to invest so many hours to get the full experience
[2:42:39] <+Ganmorg> @andre11dr yeah the end of 2 has some nasty grinding
[2:42:48] <iacus_> I this being played on actual hardware?
[2:42:53] <+SiameseDuck> Soundsn ice
[2:42:57] <Applecannon63> a moded PS
[2:43:00] <cardamomo88> OhMyDog OhMyDog
[2:43:01] <AnacondaVirtue> Ina
[2:43:01] <+Ganmorg> Honestly DDS is a super solid length for me, since it's like a total of 50 hours or so
[2:43:06] <+SilverDevilfish> All yo yens
[2:43:08] <turboyabo> the grinning of 2 isnt that hard if you had demons from 1 with you
[2:43:09] <+Ganmorg> But I never did NG+
[2:43:18] <+relentingapunch> You DO get to hang out with a cool fox
[2:43:23] <dds333a> @andre11dr moreso then this game at least, but not by much. at least for the story.
[2:43:24] <%kewlmyc> ALL YO YENS YIP YIP YAP
[2:43:24] <Gates623> All your yens yip yip yip
[2:43:26] <+relentingapunch> That fox rules
[2:43:32] <BrvldrHungryHeart> playing 2 50hs game to enjoy the full story is a Big investment
[2:43:32] <Applecannon63> YIP YIP YIP
[2:43:33] <skagtheprinceofhell> Though that says how many people miss calculate how far they had to go or such in Japan to do that as normal common curtesy
[2:43:37] <DSD24> All yo yens yip yap
[2:43:56] <algi80> one statue always lies, one statue always tells the truth Kappa
[2:44:03] <%kotl7> shoulda played Digital Devil Saga tbh
[2:44:13] <BelMadness> you already have a cat
[2:44:14] <stormhawk9891> Just pet the statue
[2:44:18] <turboyabo> woolie want to pet the fox girl
[2:44:39] <dds333a> @kotl7 yep, although it seems that Woolz already has, maybe Reg could do it
[2:44:47] <Applecannon63> Ghost of Tsushima spoiled us
[2:44:49] <DSD24> Royal Guard and Trickster
[2:44:50] <BelMadness> you can keep demons all the way to the end if you keep feeding them other demons
[2:45:00] <Am_Shigar00> yeah, during battle
[2:45:01] <andre11dr> Woolie a fox lover? The Naruto love still burns strong in him
[2:45:02] <dds333a> no hate for Raidou, tho, all in due time
[2:45:03] <%heartlesshealer> battle menu
[2:45:11] <%kotl7> true
[2:45:14] <BlackermanZX> you can command directly right
[2:45:28] <Blank9> yeah you can pause time to command them mid-battle
[2:45:34] <dds333a> @belmadness hell, even easier in this game, since you could only keep them for field skills
[2:45:36] <Blank9> so their spells are basically an extension of your's
[2:45:55] <andre11dr> I'm pretty sure Woolie never played DDS
[2:45:55] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:45:57] <AThing_> sort of not really
[2:46:10] <+MosesUnspoken> Demon Breeder
[2:46:14] <+RenoDeGeneric> Breed the demons Woolie
[2:46:16] <penitentpendant> Hojo would be proud of this demon BREEDING
[2:46:17] <andre11dr> I think the only SMT game Woolie has played is 4
[2:46:20] <AThing_> Devil Summoner has weird demon controls to the other games. The OG games had mechanics for demons going rogue and shit in battle
[2:46:26] <cardamomo88> BREADER
[2:46:29] <PMda2nd> breed
[2:46:30] <DSD24> We aren't breeding
[2:46:33] <DSD24> We fusing
[2:46:33] <Am_Shigar00> He's played a couple Personas, SMT IV, and TMS.
[2:46:36] <Blank9> DDS is like SMT meets FFX, pretty good intro.
[2:46:40] <%heartlesshealer> Incubus gonna be happy about that
[2:46:45] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Such breedable demons
[2:46:46] <lotharrio> Breed them demons.  HahaSweat HahaBaby
[2:47:02] <dds333a> @andre11dr yeah, for mainline. he's mentioned DDS, specifically DDS2 on the old channel during saltybet
[2:47:09] <DSD24> Man Johei Joestar is a good name
[2:47:26] <emptyantics> Breeding demons Kreygasm
[2:47:30] <%baka_sugoi> is this PERSONA?
[2:47:36] <+Ganmorg> I always name my Megaten heroes "Inarashi"
[2:47:39] <+Ganmorg> idk why
[2:47:40] <andre11dr> Probably he was told something about it
[2:47:43] <dds333a> @baka_sugoi yes Kappa
[2:47:44] <%heartlesshealer> you forgot the well on the previous screen, but there's always a chance to come back to it
[2:47:48] <BelMadness> ah yes, demon breeding. best mechanic.
[2:47:54] <dds333a> @andre11dr also true
[2:48:00] <+Ganmorg> I am going to breed Parvati
[2:48:10] <%baka_sugoi> @dds333a N I C E Kappa
[2:48:10] <%livlinn> ….Raven?
[2:48:10] <xeros720> oh yeah, this weird ranking system
[2:48:12] <DSD24> I like me some titles
[2:48:18] <VJdarkworld> Title: BREEDER
[2:48:21] <iacus_> Promising youngster like Stephen Dorf
[2:48:23] <DSD24> Renown!
[2:48:38] <andre11dr> @baka_sugoi Nah this doesn't have annoying teens and the generic highschool setting
[2:48:40] <DSD24> Title Dark Slayer
[2:48:42] <dds333a> the titles are great, but boy, the highest ones take a LOT
[2:48:55] <%meniscate> Herald kinda hot tho Kreygasm Kreygasm
[2:49:02] <BrvldrHungryHeart> it has 1 teen,  thats 1 too many
[2:49:04] <DSD24> Jack the Ripper was a demon
[2:49:07] <MisterCrimson> Jack the Ripper is an actual Demon
[2:49:07] <Darren716> Shit a demon was Zodiac?
[2:49:10] <cardamomo88> LUL

[2:50:21] <DSD24> @dds333a Had to do you a solid!
[2:50:30] <%baka_sugoi> @andre11dr but is it a TRANSFORMER
[2:50:32] <Am_Shigar00> He just saved a minute ago, he's good
[2:50:43] <andre11dr> Oh this guy  ,i remember fighting him in DDS
[2:50:47] <BelMadness> Raidou has some of the best SMT battle themes
[2:50:47] <MisterCrimson> CatJam
[2:50:50] <BlockingDisabled> Ok, thanks!
[2:50:51] <Qu1ckyyy> You can check the command menu
[2:50:53] <%heartlesshealer> command for battle styles
[2:50:59] <brachydios777> NOW YOU MUST SURVIVE, EVILACK!
[2:51:09] <dds333a> So, this is where Raidou goes every time he fights, just crosses the barrier temporarily as the demons attack
[2:51:18] <teefpal> Fucking fishurkle
[2:51:23] <xeros720> Pagan Urkel
[2:51:24] <DSD24> Azumi is a nice old lady
[2:51:34] <cardamomo88> thanks fish gradmom
[2:51:47] <akajaybay> No one expects demon fish Urkel
[2:51:48] <Am_Shigar00> it's a shame that the demons just BURN through their MP in this game.
[2:51:50] <+0cash> love how the demons follow you in this gaame
[2:51:51] <BelMadness> shit, I forgot Raidou does have his gun in the first game
[2:51:57] <%RyTYoung> now that one podlord from gigaboots finally makes sense
[2:52:00] <BelMadness> doesnt
[2:52:02] <DSD24> That's the good shit
[2:52:05] <teefpal> Fishguy is a girl?
[2:52:06] <andre11dr> Man i forgot how much of this shit gets reused in the next game
[2:52:06] <AThing_> no he has his gun

[2:52:38] <BrvldrHungryHeart> too bad Mag is useless for raidou
[2:52:45] <%livlinn> Is the spell names in Sanskrit?
[2:52:47] <BelMadness> that demon dialogue is too real
[2:53:13] <turboyabo> and finally obariyon gets some hits in
[2:53:13] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:53:16] <dds333a> @livlinn some of them are analogous, but not the same
[2:53:20] <%AlteisenReiseZ> These demons love their fancy jigs
[2:53:22] <+relentingapunch> SourPls
[2:53:23] <+MosesUnspoken> that music tho
[2:53:29] <%Prevot> wow that riff is very persona
[2:53:30] <%shaidot> You should probably catch more demons
[2:53:32] <+relentingapunch> Level up music kinda bangin
[2:53:41] <Am_Shigar00> I love the level up music
[2:53:44] <%heartlesshealer> one more skill to unlock, but full loyalty

[2:54:26] <BelMadness> dragon cave is just a save point
[2:54:32] <%heartlesshealer> @doggieo We're still on the first chapter at least
[2:54:37] <Phob05> Meguro did all of the PS2 SMT ost's I think
[2:54:51] <Am_Shigar00> "ara"
[2:55:02] <dds333a> @phob05 yep, with some other guys here and there,
[2:55:03] <emptyantics> Is there any other franchise that has demons this based?
[2:55:04] <%livlinn> Oh so this is the place where you can go mapping ocd
[2:55:18] <akajaybay> Frost Azumi is just a big Family Matters fan I
[2:55:19] <+FerdytheNerdy> @Am_Shigar00 "Dora"
[2:55:20] <andre11dr> I like SMT metal Meguro more than Persona pop Meguro

[2:56:16] <penitentpendant> Honestly depends if 'heal' includes SP or not for paid heals
[2:56:18] <BelMadness> just 500 yen to make you healthy? she is doing gods work
[2:56:23] <Blank9> I like how the dark zone has moricho lighting, even though it's the other way around
[2:56:26] <KyberNasse> Imagine a doctor be like "ok die then lol"

[2:59:20] <turboyabo> its for fusion
[2:59:23] <dds333a> Loyalty is what is needed to fuse them, and they confer benefits

[3:00:38] <dds333a> Leanan Sidhe, the eternal muse LUL
[3:00:44] <%GenmaKido> how tf demons know about high school musical n0nePEEK
[3:00:46] <%livlinn> GlitchCat
[3:00:48] <BrvldrHungryHeart> woolie really kinkshames? no dignity

[3:02:04] <Phob05> The spin is an option select
[3:02:31] <cardamomo88> get her loyalty up for fusion
[3:02:41] <andre11dr> That stuff is just the types
[3:02:51] <Phob05> Loyalty also lowers MAG cost
[3:03:01] <BrvldrHungryHeart> money is really sparse in this game, spend carefully
[3:03:10] <andre11dr> Some types will tell you if you can get them or not
[3:03:17] <dds333a> write these down
[3:03:19] <time_axis> thats actually a sidequest, but its really obtuse
[3:03:22] <andre11dr> Or how powerful they are
[3:03:34] <Am_Shigar00> I do not remember this at all
[3:03:35] <dds333a> @time_axis EXTREMELY
[3:03:53] <dds333a> I only got it in NG++
[3:04:02] <turboyabo> you got attacked during it
[3:04:09] <Phob05> HP also affects it
[3:04:13] <akajaybay> might have just been an interrupt
[3:04:40] <Am_Shigar00> unfortunately no, you do get interrupted.
[3:04:45] <dds333a> the game will tell you if you can't handle it, you were interrupted
[3:04:47] <xeros720> you aren't invincible during it either
[3:05:20] <Demoli_PT> damn title is a mouthful
[3:05:21] <turboyabo> yeah thats a thing you would have gotten dialog
[3:05:23] <xeros720> okay, probably need another level then
[3:05:28] <dds333a> It's just it's dark reflection, yeah
[3:05:58] <dds333a> but now, you might
[3:06:05] <theinfamousq> Johei joestar! nice

[3:07:18] <akajaybay> how often does the day change?
[3:07:22] <andre11dr> Did Woolie just forget
[3:07:26] <Blank9> it's mainly just full moon being a big deal
[3:07:26] <Applecannon63> oh god Lunatic mode
[3:07:26] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:07:30] <Am_Shigar00> I remember SMT III certain demons on full moon would just auto join me even when I said no
[3:07:31] <cardamomo88> yes him Kappa
[3:07:36] <theinfamousq> The Lunatics?
[3:07:41] <linSP> the full moon makes demons horny
[3:07:41] <chid47> the moon is important for most smt games right?
[3:07:45] <Klefth> Uuuhhh
[3:07:52] <dds333a> yeah, it's a constant mechanic
[3:07:53] <turboyabo> ice damage
[3:07:53] <andre11dr> Some demons will join you in full moon

[3:09:11] <dds333a> LUL
[3:09:11] <KnivesEve> whats the gameplay like?
[3:09:14] <theinfamousq> They REALLY wanted to make a character action game and by gods, the lack of money was not gonna stop them
[3:09:28] <dds333a> @kniveseve great, but clunky at times
[3:09:31] <Phob05> Raidou 2 is mechanically MUCH better
[3:09:34] <Am_Shigar00> thank god they refined it a lot in Raidou 2.
[3:09:37] <%heartlesshealer> go back to your sector
[3:09:39] <dds333a> the sequel refines it
[3:09:45] <turboyabo> i feel like these are the obariyon that jump you
[3:09:54] <andre11dr> Radiou 2 is big improvement
[3:09:59] <%townzzzzz> trying to make you back down
[3:10:01] <andre11dr> You get 2 demons
[3:10:12] <andre11dr> And you get to craft weapons
[3:10:15] <Am_Shigar00> they also reworked MAG into a universal MP meter.
[3:10:22] <dds333a> sub-boss out here
[3:10:43] <xeros720> all their stats are in str
[3:10:46] <turboyabo> azumi took those fist image if two them attacked you . you be dead

[3:22:12] <dds333a> @andre11dr Dude, yes
[3:22:21] <dinnydanny777> it sure would suck to be a living wall
[3:22:25] <Qu1ckyyy> It reveals hidden items
[3:22:28] <turboyabo> the other side has a dragon jaw
[3:22:31] <time_axis> inspect is a mind goblin factory
[3:22:38] <xeros720> there was a dragon wall in front of him the other way
[3:22:57] <dds333a> @time_axis yep, check every single goddamn camera angle. at least there's a sound effect
[3:23:45] <dds333a> Demonstrate also fucks me up because it's pure RNG
[3:24:04] <Qu1ckyyy> You can see if you'll fight by checking your bottom right of teh screen
[3:24:11] <%GHouseduivel> Earthbound
[3:24:14] <Blank9> lufia 2 rules

[3:24:31] <dds333a> @qu1ckyyy yep, and in this game it's fucking something
[3:24:40] <turboyabo> greedy children
[3:24:44] <xeros720> oh, i do want to say, your monsters with "sneak" lower encounter rate
[3:24:52] <DianaTheAscian> I'm indifferent sometimes I want my random
[3:24:54] <Applecannon63> DQXI 3D man is good and Tales of
[3:24:54] <Am_Shigar00> It doesn't help random battles also happen in towns. They took that out in Raidou 2 thankfully
[3:24:57] <dds333a> LUL
[3:24:59] <BurdRightsActivist> SMT 3 Nocturne without Estoma monkaS
[3:24:59] <%SirGO0SE> I was enjoying that LP tbh

[3:25:22] <+JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> raidou cant handle this demon yet
[3:25:24] <alexandrecau> Too weak
[3:25:24] <%heartlesshealer> Dog too strong
[3:25:27] <andre11dr> Ceberus dead
[3:25:32] <BurdRightsActivist> Otheus this early, holy shit
[3:25:37] <andre11dr> Actually wait no
[3:25:38] <turboyabo> no thts ceberus brother
[3:25:38] <brachydios777> Cerberus lite
[3:25:43] <dds333a> it's a dog
[3:25:46] <dds333a> LUL
[3:25:50] <andre11dr> That's Otheus
[3:25:52] <+TenWren> cerberus minus one
[3:25:54] <%heartlesshealer> Orthrus
[3:25:56] <EddieDalmunda> I love when a random encounter system makes fight five different battle tank fights on a single staircase.
[3:26:01] <Applecannon63> ORTHRUS VULCAN!?
[3:26:07] <Am_Shigar00> I do like how they change up the role and importance of demons between games. Keeps you on your toes.
[3:26:07] <Darren716> Know what I never understood, why in Persona 4 (and maybe 3 never played it) they made enemies and demons separate
[3:26:18] <andre11dr> Man i fucking hate how Cerberus is just a white wolf in these games
[3:26:29] <dds333a> @am_shigar00 right on the money
[3:26:32] <Darren716> The idea of capturing your enemies and using them is way more cool than getting some random cards
[3:26:37] <andre11dr> Where's the other heads
[3:26:44] <turboyabo> persona 3 to 5 never had demons
[3:26:49] <dds333a> in Devil Summoner he has three heads
[3:26:52] <Darren716> 5 did
[3:26:53] <BurdRightsActivist> @Darren716 3 Just has random goop monsters too.
[3:26:55] <%elderpunch> 5 has demons
[3:27:08] <Touchofweeb> Yo we Megaten now!
[3:27:12] <Phob05> Cerberus' design is a refernce to SMT 1 where it's the result of you fusing your dog with a demon @andre11dr
[3:27:15] <%justmildlilac> @elderpunch Well yes, but actually no
[3:27:16] <BurdRightsActivist> 1, 2 and Eternal Punishment all had regular old demons, though
[3:27:33] <Darren716> Like I'm even more confused why the older games did have demons as enemies, then they switched
[3:27:36] <%elderpunch> @justmildlilac true lmao
[3:27:37] <turboyabo> they had things link to demon but there enemy called a demon
[3:27:40] <dds333a> @phob05 even before that, it's a reference to Digital Devil Story
[3:27:52] <%elderpunch> i hope persona 6 is similar to soul hackers
[3:27:57] <turboyabo> *no enemy thats a demon
[3:27:57] <Am_Shigar00> SMT III has a fun easter egg negotiation where Orthrus asks him why he only has one head
[3:27:59] <andre11dr> @phob05 That makes more sense, it's still lame compared to actually Cerberus
[3:28:00] <Darren716> Like it also helps with learning type match ups if you actually have a demon in your party
[3:28:06] <dds333a> Nakajima summons a Cerberus to aidhim, they do this again in Tokyo Revelation,
[3:28:14] <DianaTheAscian> I hope  p6 is green
[3:28:14] <dds333a> sure is LUL
[3:28:29] <%elderpunch> isnt p6 gonna be white
[3:28:29] <Phob05> Ah, neat.
[3:28:39] <dmtjinni> whats going on guys
[3:28:41] <andre11dr> I hope p6 is purple
[3:28:41] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1423196401152974850?s=19
[3:28:46] <Qu1ckyyy> Try pressing L2 or L1 in battle, I think it does something in this game too
[3:28:56] <%justmildlilac> @elderpunch I think P6 is gonna be green
[3:29:08] <cardamomo88> NICE
[3:29:12] <%justmildlilac> (No Atlus doesn't remember SMT#FE either)
[3:29:16] <andre11dr> I hope P6 has an more interesting setting
[3:29:19] <Darren716> I bet P6 will be black and white, I'm hoping for purple
[3:29:19] <dds333a> among the more popular and enduring demons in this franchise are guys like Cerberus, Alice, and of course, company mascot Jack Frost
[3:29:34] <dds333a> EP already did purple Kappa
[3:29:37] <andre11dr> I was already tired of the highschool in Japan by P5
[3:29:37] <snoozeaholic> I mean SMTV UI looks super similar to FE
[3:29:42] <Am_Shigar00> @justmildlilac I think officially TMS is seen more as a FE project anyway.
[3:29:49] <%justmildlilac> @dds333a I thought P1 was purple
[3:29:52] <%barkon345> is this deamon in the basket the original baby yoda?
[3:30:02] <AThing_> p1 is only purple on the psp remake
[3:30:06] <andre11dr> We don't talk about P1
[3:30:09] <AThing_> Original is uhh, well ps1 rpg colors
[3:30:12] <BurdRightsActivist> @dds333a PSP version at least
[3:30:16] <Phob05> Alice and her gay uncles
[3:30:19] <dds333a> @justmildlilac yeah, I'm joking about how the PSP version of eP
[3:30:19] <andre11dr> That game is actually trash
[3:30:27] <AThing_> EP psp was white no?
[3:30:28] <dds333a> @burdrightsactivist yeah, beat me to it
[3:30:29] <AThing_> Not purple

[3:32:25] <+fetrigon> you okay
[3:32:28] <+fetrigon> LUL
[3:32:40] <Am_Shigar00> you got your map completion
[3:32:44] <brachydios777> Woolie did a Pat
[3:32:45] <alexandrecau> When an oversized bugs calls you a dumbass that's when you have to do evil
[3:32:47] <+choopercabra> how long ago did he save?
[3:32:57] <turboyabo> you only missed out on pryo jack
[3:32:58] <%elderpunch> Kreygasm
[3:33:00] <Phob05> I'm pretty sure Jack Frost is more like Sonic or Mario
[3:33:08] <Phob05> A company mascot
[3:33:18] <%elderpunch> Kreygasm Kreygasm
[3:33:20] <MisterCrimson> oh yeah, Jack Frost is Atlus' mascot
[3:33:25] <blackkanye> Kreygasm dying noises
[3:33:47] <Am_Shigar00> I remember in his debut, Jack Frost was just a Frosty the Snowman.
[3:33:48] <emptyantics> Bayonnetta as a secret boss in SMT when?!
[3:33:50] <andre11dr> The actual mythical Jack Frost is pretty cool  but i guess they wanted a cute mascot
[3:34:00] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> smt got nothing for it's 25th but p3/4/5 get 7 projects for their "25th"
[3:34:00] <Am_Shigar00> @emptyantics I mean, she was in the mobile game.
[3:34:02] <dds333a> @am_shigar00 yeah, even looked like him too
[3:34:10] <MisterCrimson> @emptyantics she was in the mobile game
[3:34:10] <BrvldrHungryHeart> already happened SMT DX
[3:34:16] <dds333a> LUL
[3:34:17] <blackkanye> You aren't strong enough LUL
[3:34:24] <+CaptainJax> then PERISH
[3:34:26] <turboyabo> orthus is probably level 11
[3:34:28] <dds333a> blown away
[3:34:33] <KyberNasse> Oh Orthur
[3:34:34] <copyritetm> I would love to see woolie play the smt rpgs as well
[3:35:05] <Phob05> This game also has Raiho, who is the best one
[3:35:06] <%AlteisenReiseZ> This battle theme is still a BOP though
[3:35:07] <%GHouseduivel> LUL
[3:35:11] <cardamomo88> save
[3:35:16] <%RyTYoung> omg
[3:35:19] <+Ganmorg> The other RPGs are cool but less fun to stream
[3:35:21] <Am_Shigar00> @Phob05 Shame he's locked to New Game+
[3:35:25] <dds333a> Kappa
[3:35:28] <brachydios777> Oh boy
[3:35:29] <turboyabo> you should save before the boss battle
[3:35:35] <BrvldrHungryHeart> raiho has nothing on demonee-hoo
[3:35:42] <turboyabo> they yet you to the title screen
[3:35:43] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:35:46] <Phob05> Yeah I thought he would be like the other secret demons
[3:35:50] <penitentpendant> "GAME OVER YEAAAAAAAH"
[3:35:53] <turboyabo> this game dose that
[3:35:54] <AThing_> nah this game title screens you
[3:35:56] <BlackermanZX> oh it does
[3:35:57] <Am_Shigar00> Where does Lucifrost stand on the Frost family tree?
[3:35:57] <emptyantics> GAME OVER YEAHHH
[3:36:01] <dds333a> OG is that you lose everything bro Kappa
[3:36:02] <andre11dr> It totally does that
[3:36:03] <+CaptainJax> in smt4 you could fuckin use playcoins to dodge game overs
[3:36:07] <cardamomo88> TRU GAME OVER
[3:36:10] <BelMadness> back when games werent for kids
[3:36:20] <Joestar1890> Oh it's worse, there's a title screen, but not before the game tells you you suck LUL
[3:36:22] <Am_Shigar00> @CaptainJax They even voiced it. It's a bit jarring.
[3:36:26] <+Ganmorg> @Am_Shigar00 the disgraced son of King Frost who turned to chaos
[3:36:41] <andre11dr> Back in my day we didn't have no pussy ass continues
[3:36:43] <turboyabo> like you decide to fight lucifer ,no saves, word. title screen.
[3:36:44] <emptyantics> Imagine if Sekiro or Darksouls did that after every death LUL LUL
[3:36:44] <+FuqBoiSlim> amt4 had me going up and down my stairs for 30 minutes at one point. fuck you charon
[3:36:48] <+Ganmorg> @CaptainJax I started SMTIV with 300 playcoins and ended with 50
[3:36:52] <KyberNasse> I dunno, isnt Dragon Quest "back to save spot but gimme your waller while youre at it"?
[3:36:54] <Am_Shigar00> @Ganmorg ...Isn't King Frost a chaos demon?
[3:37:00] <emptyantics> @ganmorg DAMN
[3:37:02] <KyberNasse> wallet*
[3:37:04] <andre11dr> You didn't save? Your losing everything BITCH
[3:37:10] <+Ganmorg> I don't remember exactly what race King Frost is
[3:37:15] <BelMadness> now most jrpgs have a Retry option when you die
[3:37:17] <snoozeaholic> Tyrant I think
[3:37:22] <dds333a> @am_shigar00 depending
[3:37:27] <turboyabo> king frost should be same as jack frost
[3:37:34] <Phob05> Your checkpoint is the start button
[3:37:55] <AThing_> @Ganmorg  tyrant
[3:37:57] <andre11dr> What is the best Frost
[3:37:59] <AThing_> probably depends on the game
[3:38:03] <dds333a> All of them
[3:38:05] <MisterCrimson> Black Frost, hands down
[3:38:05] <Am_Shigar00> The best frost is the frost in your heart
[3:38:06] <dds333a> Kappa
[3:38:09] <+FuqBoiSlim> king Frost is tyrant except in DDS. He's a Fiend there apparently
[3:38:10] <+CaptainJax> demoneeho is best frots
[3:38:19] <andre11dr> I really like King Frost
[3:38:24] <%elderpunch> Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[3:38:26] <emptyantics> Jack Frost only game when?
[3:38:30] <andre11dr> Even tho he looks kinda goofy
[3:38:31] <AThing_> DDS doesn't have demon summoning or fusions so the races in it don't really matter
[3:38:35] <AThing_> they're all kind of random iirc
[3:38:38] <dds333a> @fuqboislim right. although alignment means jack squat there
[3:38:49] <+Ganmorg> It's not that they're random it's that they're more broad
[3:38:55] <andre11dr> But Black Frost is the original pick
[3:38:58] <+Ganmorg> like a ton of them get lumped together
[3:39:03] <dds333a> @athing_ not entirely random, just that they don't mean anything besides classification
[3:39:05] <+Ganmorg> Meaning a lot of fiends
[3:39:06] <+CaptainJax> iirc they unlock one ability per level until they get em all
[3:39:12] <andre11dr> He Jack Frost from da hood
[3:39:14] <+CaptainJax> at least thats how nocturne works
[3:39:19] <dds333a> for example, Aerial still coincides to Divine
[3:39:21] <dinnydanny777> Level Shroomish to level 38 for Spore without evolving limesOk
[3:39:33] <dds333a> and Alilat is still an Icon
[3:39:34] <@Menitta> aw that thing is cool
[3:39:34] <+Ganmorg> @dinnydanny777 shrigma male
[3:39:35] <+FuqBoiSlim> King Frost is also voiced by Sarah Anne Williams in 4 Apocalypse
[3:39:47] <emptyantics> @dinnydanny777 I just started an emerald Nuzlocke and this will come in handy thanks!
[3:39:48] <+Ganmorg> Man that reminds me of Cherrnobog
[3:39:56] <turboyabo> meh you wouldnt be missing much

[3:40:34] <andre11dr> When i see him i think of DDS
[3:40:34] <darkfox1995> BANGERRRR
[3:40:40] <dds333a> yes
[3:40:43] <snoozeaholic> In DDS there's earth
[3:40:44] <%livlinn> MARUKAJIRI grymPOG
[3:40:45] <cardamomo88> yes
[3:40:45] <Joestar1890> In Persona 2
[3:40:48] <+Ganmorg> Earth is only in a few games yeah
[3:40:48] <turboyabo> rotate the bullet to check
[3:40:52] <+FuqBoiSlim> Wtf guys this is just a rip off of that spider demon from Toukiden :(
[3:40:53] <dds333a> in Persona, but DDS has Tera
[3:40:59] <Touchofweeb> Only P2 and DDS
[3:41:01] <Darren716> Wind tends to counter elec
[3:41:03] <AThing_> oh yeah dds did have earth I always forget that
[3:41:04] <%elderpunch> only in persona 2
[3:41:04] <brachydios777> Time to survive Evilack
[3:41:05] <dds333a> Good old Tsuchigumo
[3:41:11] <%elderpunch> DDS has tera tho
[3:41:12] <dds333a> here comes the riff
[3:41:12] <andre11dr> Earth only shows up in some games
[3:41:14] <zenith0111> "Earth" is usually just Physical types
[3:41:21] <time_axis> I think the mobile game has Earth spells too?  IIRC

[3:41:39] <andre11dr> Unless you consider shit like Wett wind earth
[3:41:56] <emptyantics> @dinnydanny777 FUGGG
[3:42:08] <%elderpunch> Kreygasm
[3:42:12] <dinnydanny777> @emptyantics I have no idea why they made it like that LUL
[3:42:13] <JetpackMcQuack> Fried lobster tonight boys
[3:42:24] <dds333a> excuse me, Force Kappa
[3:42:38] <+Ganmorg> I kinda wish nuke and psych existed in games outside of P5
[3:42:41] <MisterCrimson> Almighty
[3:42:44] <+FuqBoiSlim> uhm akshully it's almighty damage in this game 🤓
[3:42:44] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:42:50] <%elderpunch> if its not, BUFF AND DEBUFF
[3:42:51] <turboyabo> you dont have nucular here , you just got almighty
[3:42:56] <AThing_> think about persona 1 and it's like 80 elements a lot
[3:42:58] <+bullprophet> they're high-stakes rock paper scissors games and it works so well
[3:42:59] <Joestar1890> In P1 there's explosion and Hierogyphein, P2 has Aqua and Earth
[3:43:05] <AThing_> I have no idea why they decided to add so many elements to p1
[3:43:06] <dds333a> @ganmorg you're joking right LUL
[3:43:06] <darkfox1995> Use buffs Kappa
[3:43:10] <%heartlesshealer> It always helps a bit to know the lore for the demons too
[3:43:12] <AThing_> most of them don't matter at all really
[3:43:15] <Phob05> P2 also has gravity
[3:43:16] <andre11dr> The one you usually see are Fire  Wind Lighting Ice Death Light  Almighty
[3:43:20] <dds333a> it goes through everything
[3:43:22] <PerfectShadic> Yo this is my first time seeing devil summoner gameplay and i didn't know that it's not turn based
[3:43:27] <penitentpendant> Shout outs to the bosses that absorb an element, but spend there first turn casting "NULL" against that element to trick players.
[3:43:27] <+Ganmorg> @dds333a I mean Nuke and Almighty are different
[3:43:37] <dds333a> sometimes at the cost of reduced damage
[3:43:42] <+Ganmorg> and afaik psychic damage is only really a thing in P5 and DDS
[3:43:53] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> @Ganmorg nuke is in p1 and the p2 games
[3:43:55] <dds333a> @ganmorg i know. but Psi is is in Devil Summoner
[3:43:57] <MisterCrimson> Best Almighty spell? Freikugel or Anticthon?
[3:43:57] <AThing_> psychic I think is only p5
[3:44:00] <turboyabo> oh yeah in digital devil saga bosses do that
[3:44:07] <+Ganmorg> Huh didn't know that
[3:44:13] <AThing_> Oh do DDS bosses have psi? I don't remember that
[3:44:23] <dds333a> Psi is the basic skill in devil summoner, and mapsy is there too
[3:44:23] <AThing_> Probably is classified as almighty or something though
[3:44:27] <turboyabo> thats like atlas when its trying to do good rpg fight
[3:44:29] <+Ganmorg> It's called "nerve" damage in that game
[3:44:31] <dds333a> and yeah, Psi isn't in DDS
[3:44:42] <%heartlesshealer> isn't the best almight spell that combo thing for having Lucifer and Satan in your party at the same time in P3?
[3:44:42] <+Ganmorg> basically for moves that do damage and status
[3:44:42] <BlackermanZX> so did raidou just pop in there
[3:44:42] <AThing_> nah nerve is different
[3:44:52] <+FuqBoiSlim> @mistercrimson Sea of Chaos tho
[3:44:56] <emptyantics> This just makes me want another Onimusha :(
[3:44:57] <+Ganmorg> true I guess Psi is fairly different
[3:44:59] <dds333a> don't worry, strange things happen Kappa
[3:45:02] <andre11dr> Gravity is wierd one
[3:45:04] <MisterCrimson> Nocturne has Mind and Nerve damage
[3:45:05] <Darren716> SUS
[3:45:06] <cardamomo88> Kappa Kappa
[3:45:07] <zenith0111> nerve is a status effect
[3:45:10] <andre11dr> You don't see it much
[3:45:21] <dinnydanny777> limesBlink
[3:45:37] <andre11dr> Nerve is just a stun
[3:45:45] <%livlinn> kyoryuAYAYA
[3:45:47] <dds333a> yeah. nerve, and often exchanges what it corresponds to
[3:45:59] <%heartlesshealer> the strongest attack of all is making the player lose their turn
[3:46:02] <dds333a> sometimes, Nerce corresponds to sleep as well
[3:46:02] <Phob05> You can tell the Soejima was Kaneko's apprentice because of their neck's and feet
[3:46:04] <+Ganmorg> I kinda wish SMTV had more elements
[3:46:06] <Joestar1890> The Redfield bloodline?
[3:46:09] <Teradyne87> She does look a little like she's gettin' ready to dispense a Pez candy
[3:46:10] <+Ganmorg> But the unique skills all seem really cool
[3:46:19] <%Prevot> monkaS
[3:46:23] <dds333a> @phob05 true LUL
[3:46:23] <andre11dr> And then there's all the debuffs, you know THE BEST SPELLS

[3:53:19] <%Sweetangy021> Art style >Graphical fidelity
[3:53:22] <emptyantics> Did Kaneko do the DMC 3 DT’s?
[3:53:25] <%elderpunch> kanekos art and character designs are timeless inded
[3:53:33] <andre11dr> @emptyantics Yep
[3:53:34] <turboyabo> got through 1 boss that was sort of mini boss
[3:53:35] <dds333a> We'll still be using Kaneko demons until the end of time LUL
[3:53:53] <Talhee> Just got here what id mi- >4hours into stream Welp shit.
[3:53:53] <%elderpunch> yep
[3:53:54] <%Sweetangy021> And One of the mechs in ZOE2
[3:53:56] <emptyantics> Sick
[3:53:58] <dds333a> Dante's in Nocturne so...
[3:54:06] <Touchofweeb> They look super like the DDS characters
[3:54:08] <Phob05> especially the DDS ones
[3:54:08] <dds333a> also, yeah, Inhert
[3:54:09] <zenith0111> @sweetangy021 Some of those demon designs are very complex models so it had fidelity
[3:54:18] <cerberusgate2117> I think DMC got the better part of the deal. Kaneko's DT designs in return for Dante in Nocturne.
[3:54:25] <andre11dr> In every game that those designs show up they have to credit him at the end of every game
[3:54:31] <dds333a> DMC2 specifically
[3:54:36] <Qu1ckyyy> Featuring Dante
[3:54:39] <Applecannon63> Kazama Keneko also does some Tokusatsu artwork for the enemy Kaijins
[3:54:41] <BlackermanZX> Featuring Dante from the Devil May Cry Series
[3:54:43] <snoozeaholic> Featuring Devil Trigger from the SMT Series
[3:54:45] <emptyantics> The sheath in the arm is Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[3:54:53] <Darren716> Hey Woolie, do you think you're gonna stick with the 4pm time slot? Or are you going back to 1?

[3:56:29] <emptyantics> Radiou should’ve been in MVC 3
[3:56:31] <andre11dr> Oh boy MVC2 this week?
[3:56:42] <dds333a> cmonBruh
[3:56:52] <andre11dr> I'm guessing it won't be a legit version LUL

[3:57:39] <emptyantics> STORM
[3:57:52] <andre11dr> Like im not that good but i can still do Cable viper combos
[3:57:55] <@Menitta> The cast of Marvel 2 is insane
[3:57:56] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Deadpool2450
[3:58:01] <dds333a> Spiral Kappa
[3:58:20] <emptyantics> Berserker Barrage!
[3:58:27] <dds333a> If... is something LUL
[3:58:36] <dds333a> it's good, but y'know
[3:58:43] <zecht89> LUL
[3:58:46] <Phob05> SMT 1 is NOT that bad, at least the GBA version isn't
[3:58:48] <%Sweetangy021> There is a barrier to entry for pre ps2 SMT
[3:58:50] <andre11dr> Try to play P1
[3:58:51] <@Menitta> its hard to play even P3 nowadays
[3:58:58] <BurdRightsActivist> P1 Encounter rate monkaS
[3:58:58] <andre11dr> Just kidding you can't
[3:59:00] <+MosesUnspoken> P3 the best of "modern" Persona
[3:59:00] <%Sweetangy021> Total worth it though
[3:59:04] <emptyantics> P3 is rough
[3:59:13] <+FuqBoiSlim> I tried playing the iOS port of SMT1 and I dont think I made it out the mall. Granted I was in middle school but still
[3:59:14] <dds333a> It's just not as "easy", but it's still has all the game stuff
[3:59:17] <turboyabo> pffffftt persona past 2 is for babyies
[3:59:21] <@Menitta> You can drink now
[3:59:33] <%illicitdonut> woolieYE
[3:59:48] <Idon__> He has the IMPERIAL HAT PogChamp
[3:59:51] <%Prevot> strange journey tho
[3:59:52] <andre11dr> Go back to SMT 1 if you're feeling brave
[3:59:52] <%paladinstarbuster> Drip
[3:59:52] <@Menitta> that actually is pretty cool
[3:59:55] <%vilecrois> vilecrois subscribed with Prime. 
[4:00:02] <andre11dr> Those games are so jank
[4:00:12] <@Menitta> Dont you play as soldiers in Strange Journey
[4:00:19] <AThing_> yes
[4:00:21] <%Sweetangy021> It's the whole uniform with those Go Nagai Sideburns
[4:00:21] <turboyabo> like you got difficulty setting the rest of smt its just  smooth or no smooth
[4:00:23] <emptyantics> Raidou wif da drip
[4:00:24] <@Menitta> Thats so cool
[4:00:35] <turboyabo> or rough
[4:00:35] <andre11dr> Yeah i love Strange Journey
[4:00:42] <dds333a> that's the only thing he's got going for him LUL
[4:00:45] <%Prevot> soldiers and it's all adults
[4:00:49] <AThing_> Strange Journey probably has one of the best plots.
[4:00:49] <%perfectsalami> Its more than the jank. Theres multiple times in each of them where the game just straight up tells you to fuck yourself
[4:00:50] <andre11dr> Easily one of the best ones
[4:00:57] <snoozeaholic> Farmer with a shotgun is the best SMT protag
[4:01:02] <%perfectsalami> like you can feel the devs trying to kick you in the nuts
[4:01:10] <cerberusgate2117> I bought Nocturne on Steam as I missed out on it back in the PS2 days
[4:01:14] <andre11dr> Strange Journey is my favorite story hands down
[4:01:22] <andre11dr> And favorite setting
[4:01:26] <dds333a> LUL
[4:01:27] <Touchofweeb> EU PSN Nocturne freezes on the final boss...
[4:01:34] <+MosesUnspoken> Yeah, Strange Journey is the shit.
[4:01:43] <@Menitta> the thing that puts me off of Strange Journey is the first person dungeons
[4:01:49] <cerberusgate2117> Strange Journey is super interesting just from reading it alone.
[4:01:59] <emptyantics> No one talks about SMT ANARCHY
[4:02:07] <%perfectsalami> smt pre 3 and personas 1 and 2 were first person
[4:02:09] <dds333a> @menitta not a fan of Wizardry Kappa
[4:02:20] <andre11dr> @menitta That is off putting but the actual fights are pretty good
[4:02:22] <%perfectsalami> first person was the default for a while
[4:02:33] <andre11dr> And it has a lot of demons
[4:02:33] <@Menitta> One day I'll get over it
[4:02:36] <emptyantics> FPS Dungeon Crawlers are good
[4:02:45] <dds333a> many more demons await you
[4:02:56] <@Menitta> BFTG ye
[4:03:00] <cerberusgate2117> Leave Greek Elysium for the depths of Hell
[4:03:01] <@Menitta> I need to get that
[4:03:09] <@Menitta> ooooh
[4:03:13] <dds333a> On EVERYTHING
[4:03:14] <Touchofweeb> First person dungeon crawlers are a good vibe
[4:03:24] <emptyantics> What game?
[4:03:25] <dds333a> in that Gary Oldman shit
[4:03:32] <emptyantics> Oh power rangers
[4:03:42] <@Menitta> You'd have to do Parsec. Getting NullDC to work is a nightmare
[4:03:43] <cerberusgate2117> Quantum power? PogChamp
