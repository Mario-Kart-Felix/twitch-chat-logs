[0:49:57] <MyNameIsRasus> D-Pad
[0:50:03] <GoldeNOVA> Use items in this fighting game, Woolie
[0:50:05] <Exiliator> I like when powers do something cool with something simple, like she just controls paper, but her fighting style is awesome anyway
[0:50:05] <+omenzazu> hes awakened btw why hes op
[0:50:07] <LeaIsChill> @hassanico2 His awakened form is what changes his name to "Madara" so yeah
[0:50:08] <HeroOfTheWaste> I think she is one of the characters whose combo is on square instead
[0:50:14] <MyNameIsRasus> Framerate no jutsu
[0:50:20] <hassanico2> @LeaIsChill oooh, I see now
[0:50:22] <muniea3> damn all those paper cuts
[0:50:25] <niddron> the game gets harder the further you progress, you're going to have to learn
[0:50:28] <Malikwest11> that tenten
[0:50:28] <+EpitaphOfOndri> isnt she a shuare characterter
[0:50:32] <+omenzazu> shes a ranged fighter
[0:50:33] <thexiiilightning> Woolie, recharge the chakra. That's why you can't do anything XD
[0:50:35] <coldfire0007> Drop your shield and charge your chakra
[0:50:39] <ThatOneGameTester> That chakra meter shrinking
[0:50:39] <aero160h> the coat isn't madara's thing. it's from nagato's youth and the group he started back in the day
[0:50:41] <+omenzazu> use square for her
[0:50:41] <ggbhtg> @WoolieVersus if you see the bubble on your chakra meter, you can Instant Awakening on and off with the right stick, and combo cancel it. Requires meter
[0:50:43] <phatmac16> Spam the square button
[0:50:49] <aracon_> hggShaq
[0:50:53] <+BallerSwagBro9k> Dont forget he also has perm-awakened status

[0:51:05] <+UrielCobalt> She is from Rain Country, she learned how to make her paper work in rain
[0:51:06] <LeaIsChill> You can also turn off the Awakening as you want
[0:51:06] <+QuadraticGravity> @ggbhtg Chat's off dude.

[0:51:54] <dekkitout> Mad Lad Madara
[0:51:56] <hassanico2> MADARA OP pls nerf
[0:51:56] <+BallerSwagBro9k> C-C-C-C-C-COMBO BREAKER
[0:51:57] <aracon_> madara straight cheesing woolie right now
[0:51:58] <+jake_protagonist> People telling you to use square are thinking of a different character
[0:52:04] <ggbhtg> doodUltra
[0:52:04] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:52:05] <+omenzazu> wierd I thought she played like ten ten
[0:52:09] <Leonheart777> Madara going in
[0:52:10] <niddron> watch those substitution bars @woolieversus that's the meta
[0:52:10] <jonathandemel> Woof that's tough
[0:52:12] <NarcissistCactus> D:
[0:52:12] <Exiliator> Fighting games!
[0:52:14] <thexiiilightning> Yeah, Deidara is the Square character
[0:52:19] <Kirby_Sauce> Konan is good
[0:52:22] <phatmac16> Madara going ham
[0:52:24] <%gatorafan> Madara's number is so BIG
[0:52:28] <MyNameIsRasus> Deidara is the bullshit character
[0:52:29] <+got0oc> Woolie should stop wasting logs when they're recharging.
[0:52:29] <viktorwolvess> Woolie try using Guard More and charge Chakra
[0:52:30] <hassanico2> Fun Fact, TenTen is one of the more OP character in the game
[0:52:31] <rockx2207> awakened madara is so annoying
[0:52:33] <niddron> @thexiiilightning deidara was bs
[0:52:34] <wanocountry> Madara broken pls nerf LUL
[0:52:34] <+omenzazu> ignore the kunais
[0:52:35] <+jake_protagonist> Konan is sadly trash compared to others in this game
[0:52:37] <muniea3> looks neat though
[0:52:38] <+omenzazu> my bad
[0:52:38] <+BallerSwagBro9k> Shes good but not against Tobi
[0:52:40] <xdeathknightx> This is because you don't have Minh here to hold your hand Kappa
[0:52:42] <+Shotgundam009> are there two versions of Konan in the game?
[0:52:44] <ThatOneGameTester> She seems like a spam the jutsus character
[0:52:44] <LeaIsChill> Isn't this fight also a "YOU DIDN'T WIN"?
[0:52:44] <Kirby_Sauce> This is your wall. Either improve your ability, or use items

[0:53:39] <+omenzazu> dont Kunai anymore we were wrong

[0:53:58] <MutedMimic> Jebaited
[0:53:59] <NarcissistCactus> nice hitbox
[0:53:59] <DemonicHoward> you can block ults
[0:53:59] <helidzz> he blocked
[0:54:00] <ALTRNico> LUL
[0:54:00] <%hawk_rush> blocked Jebaited
[0:54:00] <+AltunRes> With her, you need to spam the fuck out of her chakra dash to stay in.
[0:54:01] <Exiliator> Minh is secretly hiding behind the couch with controller 2, making it harder for Woolie
[0:54:01] <ThatOneGameTester> he blocked it
[0:54:02] <redrins> blocked
[0:54:03] <MyNameIsRasus> He was intangible
[0:54:03] <+theredicee> he was blocking
[0:54:06] <viktorwolvess> He BLOCKED IT

[0:54:41] <+mechslayer71> EASY MODE IS MOW SELECTABLE
[0:54:41] <rosemon5001> hey you think jirayas corpse is floating around still?
[0:54:49] <CozyGUNNA> gotta use them substitutions when youre stuck in combos
[0:54:52] <Kirby_Sauce> Go back to the loadout and equip more consumeables
[0:54:52] <+theredicee> blocking is very important in this game, and getting the upper hand is dependent on forcing your enemy to burn all their substitutions
[0:54:52] <Sapphire_Breeze> don't waste your substitutions
[0:54:55] <+number_1_ninja> I don’t remember this fight being this hard
[0:54:56] <jonathandemel> Too bad she sucks, since she's actually pretty fucking strong in canon
[0:54:59] <+omenzazu> you keep substituting after the hit so you waste it
[0:55:03] <viktorwolvess> Aaaaand there goes all the substitution
[0:55:04] <AMstone776> congrats Woolie, now you can feel how one sided this fight was.
[0:55:06] <niddron> and the substitution bars are gone
[0:55:08] <arkv01> just got here, did minh get converted into chakra fuel?
[0:55:10] <cochramd1992> >talking mad smack while you're actually getting bodied
[0:55:10] <hassanico2> Did that hit behind her?
[0:55:18] <%gatorafan> Madara is playing Skullgirls ahead of time.
[0:55:18] <CozyGUNNA> @amstone776 im crying lmaoo
[0:55:22] <LeaIsChill> He got them back PogChamp
[0:55:25] <pitsuji> i think its just that madara's always in awakened

[0:55:27] <+mechslayer71> Life lead PogChamp PogChamp
[0:55:32] <rockx2207> this fight was way better in the show
[0:55:32] <jonathandemel> ULTIMATE
[0:55:33] <hassanico2> Is Madara actually incapable of using Supers cause spoilers?
[0:55:46] <aracon_> ayyyeee
[0:55:46] <LilacKing> Woolie tries and plays this game way to resourcefuly you just need to spam your dash and throw out the games 1 combo it gives you
[0:55:47] <%hawk_rush> PogCham
[0:55:48] <NeoPockeyG> You keep wasting your subs
[0:55:48] <cochramd1992> >fight man who spits fireballs with magic paper
[0:55:48] <DemonicHoward> first try
[0:55:51] <Nina96> thank god
[0:55:52] <arkv01> les go boooooi
[0:55:52] <RoldanDgr8> good
[0:55:53] <Ultimatefool> Madara sounds like "Welcome back to the stage of history" man
[0:55:54] <biomegabear> AWAKENINGS are good
[0:55:54] <Exiliator> Nice
[0:55:55] <cochramd1992> 10/10 strategy
[0:55:57] <viktorwolvess> YEYEYEYEYEYE
[0:55:58] <%gatorafan> @rockx2207 really? I remember being super let down with it on the manga
[0:55:58] <Personified134> win the fight, lose in the cutscene
[0:55:59] <wanocountry> Do you guys play with the puppet users in this game?
[0:56:00] <zero_apples> here ultimate is so cool
[0:56:02] <LeaIsChill> You only missed a cool anime panel
[0:56:05] <Kirby_Sauce> Her ult is cool tho
[0:56:05] <CozyGUNNA> ayeee
[0:56:14] <ALTRNico> NO DO IT NOW
[0:56:16] <+jake_protagonist> It’s a lame ultimate anywya
[0:56:18] <itsahegao> @Personified134 is it really a win then?
[0:56:22] <+theredicee> pro-tip: when your opponent substitutes, you want to chakra dash to them immediately in order to flinch them and maintain your combo and burn additional substitutions
[0:56:23] <jonathandemel> Fair
[0:56:26] <hassanico2> Time for Unlimited Paper Works
[0:56:28] <rockx2207> @gatorafan I mean in terms 9f the aftermath of the fight
[0:56:29] <LeaIsChill> Moments are...few and far between in this game
[0:56:35] <ggbhtg> @WoolieVersus i tweeted all yall the same advice i left here
[0:56:43] <+kyh9> Might Guy doesn’t get to be biggest-dick until NUNS4
[0:56:47] <arkv01> woolie's road to hokage is a long and treacherous one
[0:56:50] <DemonicHoward> you can always pause cutscenes to talk if you need to
[0:56:55] <hassanico2> MORE PAPER

[0:59:01] <+UrielCobalt> In the manga the explosions were continuous and lasted for 5 minutes
[0:59:01] <DensityD> we need the manga
[0:59:03] <Shishi1205> he was exploding for 30 minutes
[0:59:04] <viktorwolvess> @WoolieVersus Pls watch that fight, she almost kill him!!!!

[0:59:43] <LeaIsChill> I'm God now >:(
[0:59:43] <+theredicee> yeah, in the anime homegirl opens up a chasm in the ocean and endlessly bombards him with paper bombs
[0:59:44] <%jinking79> no
[0:59:45] <Nina96> THE BIGGEST CHEATS
[0:59:48] <DensityD> was that the stream or did the voice actually cut like that?? that was a horrible sound chop
[0:59:53] <Orbeii> action replay
[0:59:53] <dekkitout> "I am ninja-jesus" -Mad Lad Uchiha
[0:59:56] <muniea3> almost as many cheats as Boruto's Dad
[0:59:56] <NarcissistCactus> madara stopped being cool when he stopped crawling underground and using bombs
[0:59:57] <+UrielCobalt> Uchihax suck

[1:21:28] <+MajorCrasher> some say sarada is Karin and Sasuke's bastard. she looks more like Karin than Sakura to me, so it makes sense lmao
[1:21:28] <DemonicHoward> if i remember his boss lied about the terms of the mission
[1:21:33] <Orbeii> his boss was selling their village out
[1:21:35] <laguerrilha> @UrielCobalt she had more contact and was closer to Sasuke than Sakura
[1:21:35] <%hawk_rush> @thexiiilightning ohhhh, right
[1:21:36] <%yeknomlive> it's like an audiobook it's great
[1:21:41] <mrsandmando> He literally cut his hair off walking through a portal but his hair was too long.

[1:39:35] <%gatorafan> just throw paper all over
[1:39:37] <aero160h> no recap, just play the game
[1:39:37] <+jake_protagonist> the game handled that one pretty well
[1:39:39] <ggbhtg> @woolieversus separate so you dont talk over more game details?
[1:39:40] <+UrielCobalt> it was cool in the manga, forgot how it looked in the anime
[1:39:45] <%Lion_kun> It sucks in the anime
[1:39:47] <+CrowsSmallNest> Game time?
[1:39:49] <+GreenCMD> it's actually similar to the game so your not missing out
[1:39:49] <ghdgh235> do it

[1:40:02] <VidulaSaix> CC2 money
[1:40:04] <MyNameIsRasus> It actually super is

[1:40:13] <muniea3> tug of war fight
[1:40:16] <DemonicHoward> dumb question but are your vods sub locked?
[1:40:19] <laguerrilha> Cyber Conect version of the fight was better
[1:40:29] <+omenzazu> you gotta do those hidden moves you been missing
[1:40:29] <mrsandmando> @demonichoward They are not
[1:40:31] <KingVantq> @DemonicHoward no[e
[1:40:34] <KingVantq> nope
[1:40:38] <+Ghostfaceninja53534> in the anime its more of a tugowar than a fight
[1:40:39] <+omenzazu> they do a cool little scene
[1:40:43] <DemonicHoward> thanks
[1:40:46] <Orbeii> oh yeah red heads you didnt actually talk about yet
[1:40:47] <ggbhtg> @woolieversus I sent you and Reggie game advice on Twitter
[1:40:49] <VidulaSaix> @WoolieVersus Also that you know why she still wears the cloaks now, even though the game also said it but you missed it
[1:40:51] <MyNameIsRasus> Fucking gingers ruined Naruto
[1:40:53] <DensityD> playing the game, and the power of taking revenge will be right in your own hands
[1:40:58] <%Lion_kun> It was realllly bad in the manga because kishimoto cant draw for shit anymore
[1:41:00] <KingVantq> @DemonicHoward just the podcast channel vods
[1:41:06] <MyNameIsRasus> ZA WARUDO
[1:41:14] <Shishi1205> how many advices can you read in the stop time? @WoolieVersus
[1:41:17] <DensityD> the feeling of being this cool-ass ninja hero is right in your own hands
[1:41:18] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[1:41:19] <+UrielCobalt> Uchihas ruined Naruto
[1:41:21] <aero160h> Woolie just get to the Ninja war arc and watch Choji's fight
[1:41:22] <%gatorafan> you were talking about swastikas and giant explosions that worked Kappa
[1:41:22] <DatAsuna> oh boy i forgot we're still PS3
[1:41:24] <+jake_protagonist> nagato is uzumaki, konan 10 minute explosions, madara created the aktasuki and gave nagato the rinnegan, Kisame has sharks eat him to stop intel
[1:41:25] <dekkitout> How much advice can you annotate in stopped time?
[1:41:30] <MyNameIsRasus> Naruto ruinded Naruto
[1:41:33] <+omenzazu> uchihas ruin anything and everything
[1:41:34] <+BallerSwagBro9k> OMG I WAS GONE FOR SO LONG LUL LUL LUL LUL
[1:41:39] <DensityD> he'll figure it out Jebaited
[1:41:47] <VidulaSaix> Oh and yeah, for the game itself you can actually combo into Ultimate Attacks during a combo before the ender as long as you have the chakra to do so. This makes it so it's very unlikely the enemy will dodge it
[1:41:51] <GoldeNOVA> This LP is fun
[1:41:59] <+UrielCobalt> Narutoi was alright before he started hyperventilating over Sasuke
[1:42:05] <mrsandmando> Wait. Did he not know this?
[1:42:18] <+omenzazu> you can also catch some enemies with your ultimate if they are bunching off a knockdown
[1:42:18] <mrsandmando> I thought he knew this...
[1:42:27] <+UrielCobalt> so yeah, uchiha ruin everything
[1:42:32] <WanderingSwordsman> @mrsandmando this was sent earlier in the stream
[1:42:32] <dekkitout> I forgot about Naruto having a panic attack after doubling down on Sasuke LUL
[1:42:35] <laguerrilha> the game doesn't teach this right?
[1:42:45] <blue6sub6remnant6> Why would Woolie know about Naruto, especially the games?
[1:42:55] <DemonicHoward> @WoolieVersus the way to tell is if the awaken symbol has a little hole in it connecting it to the chararake bar if yes charge if no flick
[1:43:01] <niddron> it's a flick
[1:43:03] <phatmac16> Woolie did you see Naruto have a panic attack?
[1:43:08] <coldfire0007> Training mode helps a lot
[1:43:11] <VidulaSaix> Yep
[1:43:12] <+Bigdrifter210> yo happy Thanksgiving peeps
[1:43:26] <+omenzazu> or if they are bouncing on the floor
[1:43:29] <%gatorafan> woolieCHAN SourPls woolieCHAN
[1:43:30] <GoldeNOVA> Woolie should do a Scrublords of the game once he's done with all the Storms
[1:43:38] <+UrielCobalt> I thought he talked about the panic attack on their Castle Superbeast podcast
[1:43:39] <cochramd1992> how much longer will the stream go on? I need to purchase and cook dinner before 7:30 ET
[1:43:45] <aero160h> Woolie get into fighting games
[1:43:58] <Shishi1205> different bars
[1:44:00] <ggbhtg> @woolieversus just read my tweets again
[1:44:06] <%hawk_rush> we need a get into fighting games for NUNS LUL
[1:44:07] <DemonicHoward> if it has a hole charge, if it doesnt flick
[1:44:07] <cochramd1992> and it's like a 10-20 minute walk to the grocery store
[1:44:09] <ggbhtg> I explained it better
[1:44:09] <KingVantq> @WoolieVersus When you lose your first health bar you can awaken around that time
[1:44:10] <+omenzazu> ya making this way more confusing than it should be
[1:44:12] <blue6sub6remnant6> If yes, then no, but don't so yes.
[1:44:12] <+UrielCobalt> should have got food earlier, its thanksgiving
[1:44:21] <cochramd1992> >thanksgiving

[1:55:11] <+UrielCobalt> thats just the one translation for this game
[1:55:16] <%Zombino924> Are jinchuuriki just ninja nukes
[1:55:17] <aero160h> this Naruto mode is useless without his partnership with Kurama

[2:01:03] <sonofthedeepsouth> He ate the gomoo gomoo fruit
[2:01:10] <+wellhowdypardner> Almost everyone except Jiraiya gets a Phoenix Down by the end of the original Naruto
[2:01:12] <Shishi1205> I like japanses Bee way more than the english one
[2:01:18] <+omenzazu> he can tag out from each form to help what's on hand
[2:01:21] <cochramd1992> except for Jiraiya
[2:01:26] <gunsrlove> Yamato Troy Baker is still weird, put THE GUY on this tertiary character
[2:01:28] <ggbhtg> Sage Mode broke. Kyuubi Mode woke. But he CAN still use Sage Mode @WoolieVersus
[2:01:36] <aracon_> 6 tails
[2:01:37] <laguerrilha> 6
[2:01:39] <Shishi1205> 6
[2:01:39] <Sokumotanaka> 6
[2:01:44] <Doodle_Taco> 6
[2:01:50] <sonofthedeepsouth> Super Sayian problem here we go
[2:01:56] <aracon_> 4 tails was also spiky mouth
[2:01:57] <%hawk_rush> 4 is the super dark red bubly
[2:01:59] <eddi401> they did all 9 when he was fighting pain
[2:01:59] <LeaIsChill> 4 is Red vs. Orochimaru
[2:01:59] <+omenzazu> well remember he has only half of the energy
[2:02:02] <NarcissistCactus> 4 was red
[2:02:02] <+omenzazu> lol
[2:02:05] <%JetpackMcQuack> A half transformation
[2:02:08] <VidulaSaix> 6 is with the bones
[2:02:10] <laguerrilha> 6 was bones and 7 musculature?
[2:02:10] <%hawk_rush> wait
[2:02:10] <VyperVic> a lil bit of the bubbly
[2:02:11] <niddron> 4 is red 6 is red with bones
[2:02:12] <Sozu_> he only has half the kyuubi woolie
[2:02:18] <aracon_> 1-3 are bubbles
[2:02:19] <Sokumotanaka> He's learning!
[2:02:19] <eddi401> then the muscles and skeleton
[2:02:19] <dekkitout> 8 looks like a naked Eva-fox
[2:02:21] <ggbhtg> 4 has full fox coat rage
[2:02:21] <OldManDeckardCain> sage mode is ultra instinct and chakra mode is super saiyan god shiet LUL
[2:02:21] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[2:02:26] <%jinking79> 6 has the skelton
[2:02:26] <sonofthedeepsouth> 7 is muscles
[2:02:28] <+killogram123> he has half chakra for 9 tails
[2:02:36] <LeaIsChill> Could've awakened Kappa
[2:02:36] <coldfire0007> I think hes thinking of 4
[2:02:41] <+UrielCobalt> Killer bee can use all his tails
[2:02:41] <Raldavar> Bee can attack with summoned parts of the 8 tails
[2:02:42] <DemonicHoward> @WoolieVersus that is chakra cloak which is a different form, killer bee is able to do that because he and 8 get along better
[2:02:43] <Sokumotanaka> @OldManDeckardCain Sage mode came out WAY before ultra instinct
[2:02:45] <Shishi1205> Bee has full control
[2:02:46] <laguerrilha> go beyond go plus ultraa
[2:02:50] <Doodle_Taco> Yeah he is thinking of 4
[2:02:54] <cochramd1992> you need to fuck Hinata, Naruto
[2:02:55] <VidulaSaix> @WoolieVersus Well the first time you see Bee he fully transforms into the full 8 Tails
[2:02:57] <digoquadros> bee just transforms into octupus man
[2:02:57] <aracon_> 6 is skeleton
[2:02:58] <KamiiFlow> 6 was vs pain
[2:02:58] <VidulaSaix> So yeah hes got full control
[2:02:58] <+jake_protagonist> I guess because Killer Bee is just letting the tailed beast take over cause theyre pals where as naruto is stealing the Kyuubi's chakra
[2:03:02] <sonofthedeepsouth> Teach this nark bee
[2:03:03] <OldManDeckardCain> @Sokumotanaka so?
[2:03:03] <cochramd1992> she needs the hot Uzumaki dick
[2:03:10] <eddi401> Bee basically doesn't have to leash his Kiyubi
[2:03:23] <Sokumotanaka> @OldManDeckardCain It's okay to be wrong shhhhh
[2:03:28] <sonofthedeepsouth> The octobull is chill
[2:03:34] <+OkamiDude15> how much did i miss story wise?
[2:03:37] <+omenzazu> octobull is cool
[2:03:40] <+UrielCobalt> he went six tails and then was concecutively going up till he reached 8, and was about to reach 9 until his dad stopped him in his mind jutsu
[2:03:41] <Sokumotanaka> Well bee is pals with the beast so he doesn't need chakra mode
[2:03:44] <cochramd1992> nothing you can't just google
[2:03:48] <laguerrilha> @OkamiDude15 Kisame fight
[2:03:59] <Sokumotanaka> Though bee in chakra mode would be cool to see
[2:04:00] <+OkamiDude15> gotcha
[2:04:02] <ALTRNico> bars
[2:04:06] <+UrielCobalt> BE has a chakra mode though
[2:04:09] <+omenzazu> camps
[2:04:14] <laguerrilha> yep
[2:04:16] <eddi401> YEYEYE
[2:04:19] <Shishi1205> yep
[2:04:21] <VidulaSaix> Correct
[2:04:22] <sonofthedeepsouth> Now you pulling things out of your ass bee
[2:04:23] <GarbageNirvana> you think Naruto's VA gets sick of doing his raspy-ass voice all the time
[2:04:28] <Sokumotanaka> HE'S LEARNING
[2:04:29] <OldManDeckardCain> @Sokumotanaka I wasn't talking about it being a knockoff. I was talking about functionality. I don't even have to be racist to trigger you now cmonBruh
[2:04:36] <VidulaSaix> @GarbageNirvana Its what she sounds like irl so no
[2:04:38] <hassanico2> Well she's kinda an old lady I think @GarbageNirvana

[2:04:43] <+omenzazu> @garbagenirvana naw shes a old wamen
[2:04:48] <Kazuhira_Boat> @WoolieVersus Naruto is basically taking the nine tails power while it is traped by the seal where bee and the 8 tails actively cooperate
[2:04:49] <+xx123manxx> It's pretty much just her normal voice honestly @GarbageNirvana
[2:04:51] <biomegabear> Woolie are you warming up to killer bee?

[2:08:49] <Orbeii> so, all of Kabuto's entire existence Kappa
[2:08:49] <+jpipeman> Kabuto being bland is intentional, I feel

[2:10:16] <+kyh9> @wanocountry you mean Might Guy right?
[2:10:17] <+captain_history> it's totally intentional
[2:10:17] <dekkitout> Like poetry
[2:10:20] <MasterCosmic> Almost like poetry
[2:10:24] <ggbhtg> I think he did watch that fight,it was on the to do list
[2:10:28] <Shishi1205> The Sanin
[2:10:28] <laguerrilha> It rhymes
[2:10:30] <Humantrollerkaathe> reanimation fodder
[2:10:30] <wanocountry> Yung Lean
[2:10:31] <Doodle_Taco> Its because Kishi can only write so many characters LUL
[2:10:34] <+cigsmcgrigs> Pottery
[2:10:41] <ManaSpurt> @Fetty_Krill Shut up
[2:10:41] <+Zodam_Kulle> madara killed them, kabuto used their corpse for reanimation
[2:10:41] <Shishi1205> nope
[2:10:43] <cochramd1992> almost like Kishimoto has no concept of subtlety
[2:10:45] <Animorphimagi> Naruto=yahiko
[2:10:45] <Khorneflakes_> LUL

[2:10:47] <ggbhtg> THISSSSS IS YOUR LEGACYYYYY
[2:10:52] <dekkitout> Ya think? SeriousSloth
[2:10:56] <LilacKing> The gaurds deaths are worth watching some cool reanimation jutsu is shown
[2:11:01] <sonofthedeepsouth> Characterization is problem my dude
[2:11:01] <%hawk_rush> he had good character design before shippuden
[2:11:01] <phatmac16> Hes doing Saberface
[2:11:03] <laguerrilha> Visual design is good, backstory is bad
[2:11:05] <+got0oc> Kubo should've given him a hand with the designs.
[2:11:05] <LeaIsChill> Have you SEEN Samurai 8?
[2:11:05] <+omenzazu> you think that's bad? have you heard of O parts hunter 666?
[2:11:05] <badhaye> its intentional. you're not there yet dude
[2:11:07] <Shishi1205> kishimoto is not a coward because he doesnt use subtext
[2:11:08] <muniea3> I forgot about that hand tongue shit
[2:11:08] <+jake_protagonist> You can tell he was actually dying from this shit in the final arc
[2:11:09] <dekkitout> Darui is solid
[2:11:09] <sonofthedeepsouth> We have a lot of Narutos
[2:11:12] <+UrielCobalt> I love Mabui, I thought she was underused
[2:11:13] <Xiangchang> Oh god Deidara's hand-tongue keeps wiggling.
[2:11:13] <wanocountry> Kumo village got the best clothing ngl
[2:11:16] <ggbhtg> WE SHALL BE AS one....YOUUUU will RIIIISE again....THI...IS YOUR LEGACYYYYY
[2:11:17] <sonofthedeepsouth> Kishi has problems
[2:11:18] <KamiiFlow> then everyone starts wearing the chunin gear
[2:11:21] <VidulaSaix> No he just got exhausted
[2:11:21] <Animorphimagi> if you want great character designs go to Bleach
[2:11:22] <hassanico2> Oh hey look it's the most obnoxious enemy to fight
[2:11:23] <SatsumaVA> He had to lessen the design for the timeskip to save time on drawing
[2:11:29] <foghornleghorn55> Early naruto had better designs
[2:11:30] <Sokumotanaka> I mean character designs are subjective
[2:11:30] <%yeknomlive> i wouldnt say lucky i say that he finished what he pitched but then they said keep going tho
[2:11:31] <%hawk_rush> LUL
[2:11:32] <+CarlosEoM> LUL
[2:11:33] <ChamoCamouflage> He probably just got genuinely exhausted.

[2:40:23] <VidulaSaix> But no there is a reason
[2:40:23] <sonofthedeepsouth> NEW AGE WTF
[2:40:23] <phatmac16> Sasori is cool
[2:40:23] <%yeknomlive> emotions make them stronger
[2:40:24] <%JetpackMcQuack> That's boring
[2:40:24] <Sokumotanaka> Cause it makes it HURT better
[2:40:25] <%hawk_rush> there's a specific reason
[2:40:25] <%generalve> because thats stupid woolie this is better
[2:40:26] <+GreenCMD> they fight better
[2:40:26] <SvenHolgersson> Cuz they would whine SO HARD
[2:40:26] <VyperVic> it's cool shut up
[2:40:27] <RoldanDgr8> the reasony is pretty good
[2:40:28] <+Superbro64> who voices deidara?
[2:40:29] <ThatOneGameTester> They fight better when you don't puppet them
[2:40:29] <sonofthedeepsouth> OK BOOMER
[2:40:30] <+CarlosEoM> that's just how it works
[2:40:30] <hassanico2> @Sielas I think one of those is Sai
[2:40:30] <0rond> oh fuck, is no one reading chat? someone has to tell them how to control puppets
[2:40:33] <AndrewsLovesPizza> atpCarl
[2:40:33] <r90thunder> Boomer ninja
[2:40:33] <seapukku> secret black technique
[2:40:34] <+jake_protagonist> Kabuto explains its to emotionally mess with some of the warriors @WoolieVersus
[2:40:34] <damienlunas> Secret Black Technique
[2:40:37] <+BallerSwagBro9k> YEET
[2:40:41] <ChamoCamouflage> 'Cause it'd also be boring.
[2:40:41] <dekkitout> It wouldn't be a fun fight, that's why
[2:40:43] <+DarksideBluez> I say OK BOOMER to Madara. Ok GenX to Orochimaru
[2:40:45] <ggbhtg> @woolieversus Kabuto decides case by case
[2:40:45] <RoldanDgr8> it's more emotional
[2:40:48] <+DariusFTL> It depends on how much of an asshole the ninja is, basically.
[2:40:48] <cochramd1992> ooooho
[2:40:48] <Sielas> PogChamp
[2:40:49] <%yeknomlive> mirror match
[2:40:50] <NarcissistCactus> hey that's pretty cool

[2:40:50] <MutedMimic> Savage EleGiggle
[2:40:53] <LeaIsChill> KANKURO HAD SASORI?
[2:40:53] <RiverBirch> HE litteratly has his old body
[2:40:53] <goose_attack_almanac> Woolie didn't see
[2:40:54] <+EpitaphOfOndri> also if youre strong enough you can break that shit
[2:40:54] <hassanico2> Wait is he using Sasori's own dead corpse?
[2:40:55] <rosabellamelantha> USING HIS OLD BODY
[2:40:56] <sonofthedeepsouth> YEET TYE CORPSES
[2:40:57] <SvenHolgersson> USE HIS OWN CORPSE
[2:40:57] <ChamoCamouflage> It'd be boring that's why
[2:40:58] <Shishi1205> mirror match indeed
[2:40:58] <wanocountry> Sasori is a Boomer
[2:40:58] <scoopyoopydoo> oh shit he already had a sex doll of the sex doll master
[2:41:00] <rosemon5001> lol woolie didnt notice
[2:41:00] <LegionLyon> use you to beat ourself jaboodyLUL
[2:41:00] <kingjobber08> They all keep their personalities but they are forced to fight right?
[2:41:02] <itsahegao> The Edo Tensei jutisu makes you into a mindless slave. But if you’re too strong, you retain your personality.
[2:41:02] <NarcissistCactus> woolie not paying attention
[2:41:03] <+VariantX7> CORPSE FIGHT!
[2:41:03] <BlackOrchidKI> I'm piloting your corpse, bitch
[2:41:03] <redrins> woolie did you fucking catch that
[2:41:04] <+Zodam_Kulle> talk over the scene
[2:41:07] <+BallerSwagBro9k> Sasori is such a creepy fuck...
[2:41:08] <niddron> lol using his own body against him is a Boss move
[2:41:13] <wanocountry> Boomer Sasori and Zoomer Deidara
[2:41:14] <0rond> sasori turned himself into a puppet before he died
[2:41:14] <WanderingSwordsman> @woolieversus some are in control but the rest still have their personalities but are set to "attack mode"
[2:41:14] <VidulaSaix> Yeah Reggie is right
[2:41:17] <ggbhtg> @woolieversus case by case basis
[2:41:17] <hassanico2> oh boy
[2:41:18] <scoopyoopydoo> @Zodam_Kulle lol you actually care
[2:41:19] <jbees7> in order to beat sasori you got to be sasori
[2:41:22] <hassanico2> Woolie just... just wait
[2:41:24] <+omenzazu> naw if they keep the emotions it can fuck with your opponents mind
[2:41:28] <MutedMimic> Kreygasm
[2:41:29] <KamiiFlow> that was dope
[2:41:31] <rosabellamelantha> @WoolieVersus Kankuro is using Sasori's own body to beat him
[2:41:32] <%yeknomlive> what why deidara
[2:41:35] <mrsandmando> @woolieversus Woolie please pay attention, you just missed something so hype.
[2:41:36] <hassanico2> I totally forgot about the cool thing Woolie ust accidentally foreshadowed
[2:41:36] <SvenHolgersson> OH GOD I FORGOT ABOUT DEIDaRA'S FUCKING HANDS
[2:41:44] <sonofthedeepsouth> HANDS
[2:41:44] <+jake_protagonist> Yeah they let them talk to fuck with people
[2:41:47] <goose_attack_almanac> SAsori
[2:41:48] <+jake_protagonist> Sai
[2:41:49] <hassanico2> Sai
[2:41:50] <ggbhtg> Sai
[2:41:51] <dekkitout> @rosabellamelantha Now THAT'S kinky
[2:41:52] <+neutralraff> crow fire ant
[2:41:52] <+OddityOn> yeah they have their personalities but theyre stil under "mind" control
[2:41:53] <0rond> @WoolieVersus hold block to move the puppets
[2:41:53] <Arnoldoaad1> Reggie is wrong, they were mindless on the orochimaru arc, they arent now
[2:41:54] <Sokumotanaka> @yeknomlive the battle of two people yeeting things at each other
[2:41:55] <VidulaSaix> HOLD BLACK TO MOVE PUPPETS @WoolieVersus
[2:41:57] <VidulaSaix> BLCOK
[2:41:57] <crimson_force> sai

[2:42:06] <%hawk_rush> sai's brother doesn't make an appearance here I guess :(
[2:42:10] <+Dumbraccoons> the puppets were OP online
[2:42:10] <ggbhtg> Hold BLACK LUL
[2:42:11] <%DashXero> Was Kankuro V before V?! PogChamp
[2:42:12] <scoopyoopydoo> traaaaash game
[2:42:15] <LeaIsChill> Why do you fight Deidara when Kankuro would want to fight Sasori?
[2:42:18] <ThatOneGameTester> i miss the translation that made deidara say "Art is a Blast!"
[2:42:21] <CozyGUNNA> deidara is bullshit
[2:42:23] <+Vikken141> Yeah, no Sai bro
[2:42:27] <niddron> using chakra dash with kankuro is key
[2:42:31] <kingjobber08> Naruto is a huge example of a series with absolutely amazing side characters and a boring main character imo
[2:42:31] <hassanico2> Wait
[2:42:32] <wanocountry> Sai's brother is irrelevant
[2:42:36] <hassanico2> Is Kankuro just Astral Chain mechanics?
[2:42:38] <kingjobber08> all the other ninja are so cool
[2:42:39] <laguerrilha> Sai fighting ability had so much potential, shame they never went beyong with the drawing art
[2:42:44] <+got0oc> Just chakra dash
[2:42:45] <Floridamangentlyweepsact3> Puppets fucking SUCK
[2:42:45] <hassanico2> Is Kankuro using NINJA SLAVERY powers
[2:42:49] <niddron> use chakra dash to send your puppets
[2:42:49] <%yeknomlive> what happened to the sasori puppet he just showed off? is it super only?
[2:42:55] <Sokumotanaka> they're stands woolie , treat them like stands
[2:42:56] <VidulaSaix> Yeah
[2:42:59] <coldfire0007> It is Astral Chain
[2:42:59] <VidulaSaix> Its awakening
[2:43:01] <+BallerSwagBro9k> To beat Deidara easily you gotto get in close. He's terrible in short range.
[2:43:04] <%mistspade> Time turn learn the Carl clover tech
[2:43:08] <+omenzazu> AWAKEN DAMMIT lol
[2:43:11] <+DarksideBluez> FUN FACT: Naruto was supposed to be about magicians/wizards but SHONEN JUMP was like NAH BRUH change it to NINJAS and we GUD son.
[2:43:12] <Sokumotanaka> Ye old astral chain
[2:43:14] <damienlunas> Castle Super Beast Scroll\
[2:43:18] <mrsandmando> Awakening
[2:43:20] <+jake_protagonist> Yeah chakra dash allt he time witht he puppets
[2:43:20] <Fetty_Krill> Here's a tip Woolie block in order to bring your puppets to you in case you lose track of them
[2:43:23] <+Superbro64> Holy crap does SONIC voice deidara?
[2:43:28] <brockyboi96> he needs to utilize chakra dashing more
[2:43:28] <BlackermanZX> Awakening
[2:43:30] <+Ghostfaceninja53534> motherrrrr fatherrrrr tell me where it went wroooong
[2:43:32] <+Superbro64> is that SONIC that I'm hearing?
[2:43:32] <0rond> you have awakening acess woolie, hold chakra charge until it overflowss @WoolieVersus
[2:43:35] <VidulaSaix> The puppet characters are hella strong buit take some getting used to
[2:43:40] <0rond> @WoolieVersus hold block to move the puppets
[2:43:41] <wanocountry> @darksidebluez sooo Fairy Tail?
[2:43:42] <+omenzazu> AWAKEN FUCK LMAO
[2:43:46] <%hawk_rush> fucking bodied
[2:43:48] <Galwaer> god this is a mismatch of character mechanics
[2:43:49] <+BallerSwagBro9k> Yeah Deidara ia annoying
[2:43:49] <Sokumotanaka> And now the war is lost
[2:43:52] <+RowenCleric> so weve entered the filler
[2:43:53] <+neutralraff> woolie is not the puppet master.
[2:43:54] <+jake_protagonist> just charkra dash spam because you stay safe and the puppets go in
[2:43:54] <+kewlmyc> DON'T UNDERESTIMATE *dies*
[2:43:55] <%mistspade> You gotta negative edge it woolie
[2:43:56] <+DarksideBluez> @wanocountry PRETTY much
[2:43:59] <jbees7> is awakening sasori puppet?
[2:44:01] <niddron> using chakra dash with kankuro is key
[2:44:11] <%jinking79> it like Jojo send ouf stand leaving u defenseless
[2:44:13] <Shishi1205> I imagine
[2:44:24] <+omenzazu> when your health on RED you should AWAKEN
[2:44:26] <cochramd1992> play it like V
[2:44:32] <ggbhtg> @woolieversus reggie, there will be a bubble on the right of his meter
[2:44:33] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[2:44:35] <damienlunas> SAVIOR BLOODSTAIN HELLFIRE SHADOW
[2:44:36] <NarcissistCactus> yeah just play carl clover
[2:44:38] <laguerrilha> Normally doll controlers have the doll lock on the oponent
[2:44:42] <VidulaSaix> @WoolieVersus Best advice I have for Kankuro is abuse chakra dash to make sure the puppets are always in the enemies face
[2:44:46] <laguerrilha> this one isnt great
[2:44:53] <Sokumotanaka> Slap his shit
[2:44:55] <+BallerSwagBro9k> Ye good job
[2:44:56] <hassanico2> How was "Art is an explosion" translated before the official release?
[2:44:57] <foghornleghorn55> You have to use chakra dash constantly
[2:45:05] <CozyGUNNA> use chakra dash
[2:45:10] <wanocountry> Ninja Batman vs. ISIS member
[2:45:26] <cochramd1992> art is a bomb
[2:45:27] <CozyGUNNA> you can also use combo cancels with chakra dash
[2:45:36] <+UrielCobalt> Where's muh boy Omoi?

[3:10:02] <torinismyname> @EVA_Unit02 Personally, I like that Kishi has been letting his longtime assistants take the wheel. S8 has great art

[3:11:55] <ggbhtg> sync test is for recording side
[3:11:55] <niddron> bring back ding
[3:11:57] <Kazuhira_Boat> NUNS4 best NINS
[3:12:00] <ggbhtg> not stream
[3:12:18] <pistachio_the_nut> YES
[3:12:24] <+CrowsSmallNest> Real life editing
[3:12:27] <ThatOneGameTester> i love seeing the background work being done
[3:12:30] <mrsandmando> PurpleStar PurpleStar PurpleStar PurpleStar PurpleStar
[3:12:31] <ggbhtg> If you start the match with a bubble to the right of your Chakra meter, you can do Instant Awakening. Turn it on and off with Right Stick, even mid combo. At dark red life, everyone can do full awakening as a Desperation mechanic. Charge your meter while it's already full.
[3:12:33] <VidulaSaix> You dont have to finiwht with it to see it either Woolie so dont worry about using it at the end
[3:12:36] <NarcissistCactus> now don't do the ult again
[3:12:43] <ThatOneGameTester> the note taking and editing intructions
[3:12:43] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:12:54] <+snarfton23> honestly just want them to get to Nuns4
[3:13:21] <+xx123manxx> Just Dash cancel combo on the enemy till they run out of subsitutions and you win
[3:13:22] <ThaAwsmMan> @ggbhtg not every one has full awakening. if you have fast you cant use the full one
[3:13:23] <ggbhtg> he's probably gonna do it at the end anyway to get the finish chance
[3:13:23] <+captain_history> 4 seems cool yeag
[3:13:25] <+omenzazu> I just wanna see woolie see zabuza
[3:13:29] <+got0oc> Laming it out is how you get zoned with certain characters. Most of the time you want to go in, and disengage only to charge after a knockdown.
[3:13:32] <mrsandmando> Please don’t use Kunai the ai knows and will actively punish you for spamming.
[3:13:38] <0rond> Hanzo's ult is also really cool
[3:13:47] <laguerrilha> @snarfton23 one or two more streams and this will be done. NUNS4 will probablt be next year
[3:13:53] <AxelCezar> bitterDab bitterDab bitterHype
[3:14:07] <+BopBeep> Why is he laming it out anyways?
[3:14:07] <Sol_Install> Hanzo was Code vein before code vein
[3:14:09] <+UrielCobalt> did he do it yet?
[3:14:14] <+omenzazu> woolie and his kunai espamming
[3:14:35] <+omenzazu> do a regular jutsus for once
[3:14:36] <its_sinny> that's that ds2 poison
[3:14:41] <+OkamiDude15> dash cancel to eat their substitution
[3:14:41] <+omenzazu> triangle and circle
[3:14:43] <NinjaGentleman> honestly basic combos is faster
[3:14:43] <laguerrilha> makes sense
[3:14:48] <ggbhtg> attack, let them sub, then dash cancel attack
[3:14:52] <foghornleghorn55> Don't spam subs. also use block
[3:14:53] <Jayfox82> Kunais aren’t that great
[3:14:55] <+xx123manxx> yeah weeb shit
[3:14:57] <+Bricespresso> yeah pursuit after they dodge
[3:15:00] <cochramd1992> Judgement Cut!
[3:15:04] <+Superbro64> that move is full screen, by the way
[3:15:14] <+xx123manxx> Ganbarre woolie
[3:15:20] <VidulaSaix> @WoolieVersus Some advice to stop Woolie from burning his substitutions is when he whiffs a combo, instead of subbing to get behind him just combo cancel to dash back into them
[3:15:21] <Doodle_Taco> Hey chat, what did I miss?
[3:15:28] <ThaAwsmMan> chakra dash during combo to continue dealing damage @WoolieVersus
[3:15:36] <0rond> when they use their substitution while you combo them, you can chakra dash at them to keep comboing and wasting their substitution. @chesterr01
[3:15:37] <CozyGUNNA> health items
[3:15:42] <RayCSmooth> @WoolieVersus double jump is a homing move
[3:15:48] <NinjaGentleman> it charges the same rate regardless
[3:15:48] <Fetty_Krill> Block Woolie
[3:16:00] <niddron> go in now!
[3:16:04] <laguerrilha> @Doodle_Taco Kisame Deidara and Sasori
[3:16:13] <niddron> he has no substitution go in!
[3:16:22] <ThaAwsmMan> yes
[3:16:23] <Doodle_Taco> @laguerrilha Thanks man
[3:16:24] <VidulaSaix> You cant Ultimate during awakenings
[3:16:24] <%JetpackMcQuack> Get into NUNS
[3:16:29] <VidulaSaix> It will bounce off
[3:16:33] <0rond> you can ult them during awakenings in 3
[3:16:34] <NinjaGentleman> he's awakened
[3:16:35] <Orbeii> PogChamp the youtube cut?
[3:16:38] <VidulaSaix> Oh you can?

[3:16:57] <+BopBeep> Why try to make a seamless cut?
[3:16:57] <+ctommy0720> Yes you can
[3:16:58] <2fcd_twitch> I thought you could in 3
[3:16:59] <+omenzazu> it only doesnt work in 4
[3:17:01] <+Nylils> In 4 it works 2
[3:17:06] <CozyGUNNA> you can in 3
[3:17:07] <+omenzazu> you can in 3
[3:17:08] <niddron> you can't awaken if he is awakens
[3:17:08] <VidulaSaix> I guess so!
[3:17:09] <2fcd_twitch> It breaks them out of it
[3:17:13] <+DariusFTL> there's a quick way to find out
[3:17:14] <ThaAwsmMan> IT WORKS IN 4 TOO what are guys smoking
[3:17:14] <+Nylils> You can ult awakenings in 4
