[0:39:34] <picanoturna> this man SPITTIN
[0:39:36] <DSD24> Oblivion
[0:39:38] <heysamuel> the pale is the coolest concept in modern fiction
[0:39:47] <%madmanrambler> its up there
[0:39:53] <heysamuel> imo, of course
[0:39:58] <%DiscoMatador> Vacuum Decay
[0:39:58] <%X2Eliah> Heat death of the universe YEAAAAH
[0:39:59] <andre11dr> So it Nihilus
[0:40:06] <illTemperedSeaBass> What was, will be. What will be, was.
[0:40:25] <AlphaBankai> This is 10x worse than it was before
[0:40:25] <%madmanrambler> after the world, the pale. after the pale, the world again.
[0:40:26] <+TheFrancix> martinaise is so fucked
[0:40:29] <Pookiedaexzile> Like a Prion
[0:40:34] <primaryfire> martinaise is FUCKED
[0:40:36] <RushUnplugged> @illTemperedSeaBass no that's the Worm
[0:40:37] <objektivespieleanalyse> Ahh my ficticious world threatening slowly progressing phenomenon
[0:40:40] <%kewlmyc> Yeah, that town is fucked
[0:40:51] <spaceitaly> so much more than Martinaise is fucked
[0:40:56] <derap41> LUL bit "literal" with information theory
[0:41:00] <+eanscrale> It'll make a sick night club until then at least.
[0:41:06] <heysamuel> kim i can speak with the city
[0:41:07] <%madmanrambler> it wasn't formed in the church. the church was formed around it.
[0:41:09] <+TheFrancix> probably all jamrock is fucked
[0:41:10] <%madmanrambler> BEST LINE
[0:41:13] <mariothemaio> conspiracy theories :)
[0:41:20] <%xcompleasedad> This is more important than the murder
[0:41:26] <%krispen_wa> reality is fucked
[0:41:30] <heemwizard> @mariothemaio but theres evidence for all of these
[0:41:32] <picanoturna> after beating this game 3 times i still cant tell if this is real or just in harrys head
[0:41:38] <%madmanrambler> its totally real imo
[0:41:43] <AlphaBankai> Harry is super curious of the Pale, because he is a "past" man
[0:41:47] <tequi1asunset> It might be the reason why harry lost his memories, aside from the drinking
[0:41:54] <mariothemaio> @mariothemaio oh sure, i more mean that's how it started for harry
[0:41:55] <KaseKaizer> SCP PogChamp
[0:42:02] <RushUnplugged> now add to this, the fact that the Pale influences people's memory and...
[0:42:03] <%madmanrambler> I would bet on it tbh, the game never confirms it but I think you can draw a line from harry crashing his car to here
[0:42:04] <DSD24> Is this Keter level?
[0:42:04] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule

[0:44:28] <+diobestwaifu> Straight up greatest skill
[0:44:41] <ingman112> Just popping in, but he still needs to check in with Joyce about his gun and Evrart right?
[0:44:41] <AlphaBankai> Best thought is the hardest one to get @madmanrambler The Bow Collector

[0:45:20] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @OblivionSword1
[0:45:22] <%GHouseduivel> 🥚
[0:45:23] <dave_guns> You know, considering the way this universe works... Harry might be right
[0:45:24] <spaceitaly> only The New can hold off the past
[0:45:25] <+illusiveSaint> culture keeps the world TOGETHER
[0:45:32] <heemwizard> After life, death, after the world, the pale
[0:45:45] <mariothemaio> and after the pale, the world again
[0:45:47] <stardustcrusad3r> wait what
[0:45:50] <dave_guns> oh yeah occasional time travel talk, no big deal
[0:45:54] <marcomatame> @OblivionSword1 sent to the shadow realm
[0:45:55] <%cobalt_phoenix_> uhhh
[0:45:58] <Pookiedaexzile> So theres more of these
[0:45:59] <reonome> god fuck the pale
[0:45:59] <iacus_> man, Revachol has it rough. All the socioeconomic collaps, plus a hole of Pale to boot? dang
[0:46:03] <picanoturna> hmmmm
[0:46:06] <OblivionSword1> oops
[0:46:07] <%baka_sugoi> yeah...
[0:46:08] <heemwizard> this shows up in the moralist quest lol
[0:46:09] <%OtakuSnake1> THATS RAD
[0:46:09] <Indigo_Automaton> Ghost Radio
[0:46:09] <+TheFrancix> cleaning out the rooms is the title of song made by british sea power the composers of disco elysium's music
[0:46:09] <SomeAsianDood> ah yes that seems normal
[0:46:10] <Pookiedaexzile> In Revachol
[0:46:11] <JetpackMcQuack> oh god
[0:46:12] <+Archmortal> the pale is a storage unit that can't be decrypted
[0:46:12] <%krispen_wa> @iacus_ potentially 7 HOLES
[0:46:15] <heysamuel> this whole convo is why the moralist quest is my favorite
[0:46:16] <%sahr_zand> "that makes sense"
[0:46:18] <meatman_noplan> Don't like the idea of suddenly catching your long dead mother on the phone.
[0:46:18] <+illusiveSaint> the past gets traveled thru the radio literally
[0:46:19] <AlphaBankai> @iacus_ "a hole"? There's seven
[0:46:20] <Davimotion96> No wonder RCM officers tend to be fucked up
[0:46:21] <picanoturna> ::::makes you think::::::
[0:46:21] <dave_guns> Soona is cute
[0:46:21] <stardustcrusad3r> is this about the voice in the doorbell
[0:46:24] <mariothemaio> Moralist quest is the best for overall worldbuilding lore
[0:46:26] <taeko_ohnuki> so that shivers was...
[0:46:29] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @stardustcrusad3r yea
[0:46:30] <%dukenux> Harry just secured himself whatever would be this worlds version of Noble Prize in physics
[0:46:33] <iacus_> yeah, potentially seven. even worse lol
[0:46:40] <dave_guns> Completely human related too, a cosmic event made for humans only
[0:46:40] <+TheFrancix> talk to egg head
[0:46:44] <ingman112> @woolieversus Joyce should have some new dialogue as well, under some of the older options
[0:46:48] <+LandOfTheWay> great thought
[0:46:51] <+diobestwaifu> Best skill in the game
[0:46:53] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Wait aren’t the other 6 churches all destroyed?
[0:46:57] <marcomatame> The pale is everything that has ever happened all at once
[0:47:02] <%krispen_wa> Cleaning out the Rooms is a British Sea Power song
[0:47:03] <Pookiedaexzile> The city has holes in reality all over it
[0:47:08] <spaceitaly> "seven"? are you guys forgetting what exists between the isolas?
[0:47:09] <guiltyboya> where the hood, where the hood, where the hood's at?
[0:47:10] <available_line> It's like all information in the universe stored inside the event horizon of a black hole.
[0:47:13] <chainsaw105> I like the idea that the Pale forms in the ruins of the OLD ideals, while it is the new, in this case the anodic dance club, that suppresses it
[0:47:21] <andre11dr> So this a great thought
[0:47:21] <meatman_noplan> Its rarefied past.
[0:47:21] <mariothemaio> get rid of DOB generator
[0:47:22] <skyenoz> @suckerpunchsyd yep, so no more containment for them...
[0:47:22] <heemwizard> its a good one
[0:47:24] <+illusiveSaint> replace superstar
[0:47:28] <SomeAsianDood> @spaceitaly they're talking about holes
[0:47:33] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @skyenoz NotLikeThis ohhhh boy
[0:47:34] <Visorak6> DOB
[0:47:39] <andre11dr> Yeah replace superstar
[0:47:44] <buffcat> jamais vu isnt that useful anymore
[0:47:46] <LegitBarnacleBoy> pepeD
[0:47:47] <Indigo_Automaton> Superstar can go
[0:47:50] <heemwizard> replalce dob?
[0:47:52] <spaceitaly> @chainsaw105 the pale is mark fisher's concept of hauntology made manifest
[0:47:52] <AlphaBankai> In a new life. By the SEa Side. You Wake Up
[0:47:56] <dave_guns> yeah you're never very superstar anymore
[0:47:59] <SomeAsianDood> jamais vu always useful
[0:47:59] <Indigo_Automaton> Oh that's good to get rid of too
[0:47:59] <WeepyDevil> no that ones great
[0:48:03] <%dukenux> Wouldn't Joyce and Evrart like to hear that the city is oa
[0:48:11] <WeepyDevil> some kind of superstar is pretty worthless
[0:48:12] <DSD24> No now you forgot your age again
[0:48:15] <WeepyDevil> oh well
[0:48:15] <%Jeshk0> who needs to remember their bday anyway?
[0:48:16] <+mechslayer71> date of birth generator was really good but okay
[0:48:17] <%dukenux> *is pale-posituve
[0:48:18] <WeepyDevil> too late lol
[0:48:24] <AlphaBankai> Woolie is so quiet, is everything okay?
[0:48:29] <heemwizard> @dukenux i'd doubt evart would believe that
[0:48:33] <dave_guns> lore is good
[0:48:35] <iacus_> not all thoughts are equally useful for sure

[1:25:03] <+mechslayer71> @madmanrambler I mean even in a vacuum, what its described as vs what it actually does in game is a big gap. I expected crazy psychic shit, and that happens sometimes, but it's mostly just stupid sounding attempts at being wacky
[1:25:03] <iacus_> no words
[1:25:04] <andre11dr> DO IT FOR THE CITY
[1:25:05] <dewwy125> too many eciies

[1:25:32] <dreamfillah> @buffcat what's that
[1:25:33] <heysamuel> such a good scene
[1:25:35] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Wear your goddamn cloack ^_^
[1:25:35] <meatman_noplan> You start out getting some would-be speed dealers off an ice floe and end up having a religious experience, speaking with the soul of the city. 10/10
[1:25:36] <+DeeJayOkay> real talk, how many tims has Kitsuragi picked us off the floor?
[1:25:36] <notadeasterisk> people who beat the game in 20 hours
[1:25:37] <SilverWolfX9> oh this is the best scene
[1:25:39] <+ReallyBigRocks> Definitely imagining that
[1:25:44] <derap41> Climax reached now comes the Comedown
[1:25:48] <buffcat> She tells you the city will be blown apart in 22 years
[1:26:01] <%Juriasu> MISHUN COMPRETE
[1:26:03] <heemwizard> dont think this can fit a thousand people
[1:26:07] <heemwizard> church

[1:26:11] <meatman_noplan> Mission. Complete.
[1:26:14] <notadeasterisk> they missed a hidden check
[1:26:15] <dewwy125> on the comedown now
[1:26:21] <%cobalt_phoenix_> YOU DID IT
[1:26:22] <dave_guns> doesn't matter

[1:26:33] <+TheFrancix> BEST SIDEQUEST
[1:26:35] <taeko_ohnuki> Ahhh, good times
[1:26:36] <Treasure_Vault> Failing Kim's check is really, really bad
[1:26:39] <crunchington001> Can you imagine playing through this game and not doing this sidequest?
[1:26:39] <derap41> I need a cigarette after this
[1:26:39] <%livlinn> spaceyeenSmuggydance spaceyeenSmuggydance spaceyeenSmuggydance
[1:26:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> @notadeasterisk Every time you talk to someone in this game you're missing hidden checks
[1:26:45] <mrblitzstream> Got the Blood Pumpin
[1:26:46] <dreamfillah> BEST SIDEQUEST
[1:26:47] <DelgotHansto> @buffcat saw that on the wiki and was instantly drawn to it, good to know where it comes from, hypest quote in the game
[1:26:48] <+PkSilent01> Did they get racist during that lart
[1:26:51] <+PkSilent01> Part
[1:26:51] <mr_magnificent_305> You get a really big revelation if you pass Godly reaction speed check
[1:26:52] <dave_guns> if they filled the church with people doing hardcore, it might slow down the hole
[1:26:56] <meatman_noplan> Good to meet you, miss
[1:26:57] <+mczarklesby> Congratulations!
[1:26:58] <mrblitzstream> EVERYBODY GOT MOTIVATED
[1:26:59] <+LandOfTheWay> this game is godlike
[1:27:00] <dewwy125> @crunchington001 my game glitched when the church started shaking and i couldnt complete it :(
[1:27:04] <%hax_metatron> Now we just barrel to the end of the game
[1:27:04] <Chatterbox1991> @WoolieVersus You desperately need to see the fail version of inviting Kim to dance
[1:27:11] <marcomatame> We transcended the physical realm and entered the realm of the Gods through auditive air fluctuations and bodily contortions.
[1:27:18] <%Gruhunchously> Goddamn Shivers
[1:27:21] <andre11dr> I like how she likes you because you literally represent the city as a cop
[1:27:22] <dave_guns> oh yeah, the murder
[1:27:22] <derap41> Inland crying in the corner saying he's got a bad feeling
[1:27:23] <zanzibarian_hamster> Why does he need to see it?
[1:27:23] <chainsaw105> Queen Shivers technically
[1:27:31] <spaceitaly> back to reality
[1:27:33] <AlphaBankai> Game over huh, what even quest is there to complete anymore, game is done after that
[1:27:33] <meatman_noplan> Junkyard Dog
[1:27:34] <+Bobbledygook> No more stream needed, we’re done here, what more do we need
[1:27:49] <+fetrigon> wtf is this Q outfit? LUL
[1:27:51] <+ReallyBigRocks> I think theres a murder or something
[1:27:51] <%hax_metatron> Exactly, this is the game for me. There's one more scene I want Woolie to see, but this is a GOAT LP already
[1:27:52] <%Gruhunchously> We did what needed to be done
[1:27:55] <%krispen_wa> i guess theres the investigation sidequest to finish. but what a main quest though
[1:27:59] <SomeAsianDood> we still need to meet the other girls though chat
[1:28:03] <+Bobbledygook> Now to finish the side quests
[1:28:06] <andre11dr> He still has to find the last armour piece huh
[1:28:10] <Trace_Bovier> ok what the heck were we supposed to actually be doing. something about a murder or something?
[1:28:11] <TheMagneticDragon> Whatabout good old necktie, you need the disgusting necktie, don't betray your friend bratan
[1:28:14] <primaryfire> phys instrument will be all good in a couple hours
[1:28:18] <%Gruhunchously> "Pretty good" Kappa
[1:28:20] <skyenoz> it's INTERESTING
[1:28:20] <Treasure_Vault> Not good.
[1:28:20] <derap41> failing is almost as good as winnign
[1:28:20] <AlphaBankai> Tiago is imbibing
[1:28:22] <LegitBarnacleBoy> he's imbibing
[1:28:27] <Tiittamari> tiago's chilling
[1:28:28] <%hax_metatron> Tiago is on a different level
[1:28:31] <Fabpsi_> Crabman is dancing in the void
[1:28:32] <Treasure_Vault> They exist, they are fascinating, they are not good
[1:28:32] <+ReallyBigRocks> Busy bein a crab man
[1:28:35] <WeepyDevil> tiago's high on the end of the universe
[1:28:35] <%baka_sugoi> taigo saw
[1:28:36] <Demoli_PT> the fail state on the authority check with kim is NOT good
[1:28:37] <%cobalt_phoenix_> tiago probably can't hear anything up there
[1:28:40] <derap41> pretty sure he's humping a hole into a beam up there
[1:28:41] <primaryfire> maybe he just always feels it
[1:28:48] <%dukenux> but this was perfect
[1:28:51] <Ids560> I think the shivers failure is alright but the authority failure is real bad
[1:28:52] <linSP> do NOT fail with Kim
[1:28:52] <taeko_ohnuki> Tiago is checked out
[1:28:53] <zanzibarian_hamster> oh please no
[1:28:59] <%Juriasu> no you don't need to
[1:29:02] <derap41> chat stfu
[1:29:02] <guiltyboya> OOF
[1:29:03] <The_Grand_J> tiago is likem "there's no such thing as a coincidnence
[1:29:03] <Demoli_PT> no dont worry
[1:29:04] <Trace_Bovier> just save
[1:29:04] <Fabpsi_> no need
[1:29:06] <%madmanrambler> nah don't even worry about it

[1:29:15] <RaiNiMayonnaise> Unnecessary tbh
[1:29:18] <%LCLSmoothie> nah nah nah it’s fine
[1:29:20] <dave_guns> don't worry about it, just keep moving forward
[1:29:20] <%cobalt_phoenix_> your stats are so good it's probably actually harder to fail
[1:29:31] <dave_guns> You invented the future of dance and saved Revachol
[1:29:36] <heemwizard> talk to Joyce
[1:29:40] <dave_guns> that's a nice point to move on

[1:45:55] <WeepyDevil> @Tiittamari esprit de corps to the max
[1:45:59] <dreamfillah> You can do exposition well, when your characters behave and talk like PEOPLE
[1:46:00] <JetpackMcQuack> just learning shit
[1:46:02] <dave_guns> turns out actual effort and knowledge pays off
[1:46:05] <andre11dr> This is what happens when a novelist writes your game
[1:46:05] <+Archmortal> an amnesiac re-learning the history of the world
[1:46:07] <+jhuzar91> exposition done right
[1:46:08] <primaryfire> the writing is so vivid and imaginative that it paints a picture so easily that you forget you're not having stuff shown
[1:46:18] <spaceitaly> you ARE being told a lot, but shown even more
[1:46:26] <mrblitzstream> @dreamfillah Big Facts <3

[1:51:29] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> YUP
[1:51:30] <BurnySpirit> Joyce is extremely nice and accomodating on the surface but like if you look at her actions and statements for any length of time its like damn this lady is messed up
[1:51:32] <JetpackMcQuack> disassociate or die
[1:51:32] <+TheFrancix> Joyce is a smooth talker is shitting you all the way until the end
[1:51:33] <mrblitzstream> Elon Musk
[1:51:35] <asdief_> sociopathy
[1:51:37] <meatman_noplan> And some of them need to be 0.

[1:51:47] <FassieFons> -100 empathy
[1:51:48] <Prevot> extremely high and low stats
[1:51:49] <derap41> charm so high she can't help but be relatable

[1:51:49] <dave_guns> push one stat to the max and see the consequences
[1:51:51] <+jhuzar91> as long as your composure high you can do it

[1:51:59] <Chatterbox1991> Donald Trump
[1:52:00] <%ppangboi> I always love how Joyce polarizes the chat
[1:52:05] <iacus_> It's still very human, just at a completely different level than most
[1:52:10] <%X2Eliah> 0 empathy
[1:52:16] <AlphaBankai> @Johannen yes, and she's a representative
[1:52:17] <andre11dr> Half Light is 90
[1:52:18] <derap41> inhuman qualities
[1:52:27] <skyenoz> Every small decision might cause someone to lose their job. You HAVE to have no empathy

[1:52:49] <quesokano> Why you bein' so nice??
[1:52:59] <andre11dr> Yeah you have to learn to be cold
[1:53:00] <heemwizard> @mechslayer71 but you're still not a ceo
[1:53:00] <iacus_> that's sadly what you have to do to prevent things from crumbling down
[1:53:01] <derap41> Gotta step on those heads
[1:53:07] <%dukenux> just think of them as numbers
[1:53:08] <quesokano> gross
[1:53:16] <Dopamien> hes a straight shooter with upper management written all over him
[1:53:18] <Chatterbox1991> Pro-Social Sociopathy
[1:53:19] <JetpackMcQuack> you got the smell
[1:53:24] <%BernieSandworm> it might be cruel, but we NEED that quarterly growth
[1:53:26] <Pookiedaexzile> Social Climbers
[1:53:30] <derap41> the higher you go the less emphatic you need to be
[1:53:35] <%Irridium> The shareholders MUST get more money
[1:53:37] <+mechslayer71> @heemwizard he said if you have more than two commas in your net worth you're a psycho, no mention of ceo
[1:53:50] <Yung_FckUp> youre the best at harassing women so were promoting you congrats
[1:53:56] <+TheFrancix> this game is about how amazon is bad and a small communist workforce is taking a part of amazon for themselves
[1:53:58] <heemwizard> @mechslayer71 ah
[1:53:58] <dave_guns> so that's why she doesn't sleep
[1:54:00] <CzeekyTV> too bad your money can't help, Joyce
[1:54:02] <derap41> turning into Pale Driver
[1:54:03] <elshadow7> Radioactive nostalgia
[1:54:15] <%krispen_wa> Slightly more rational pale driver
[1:54:16] <BurnySpirit> I wonder how many people in DE's universe just sail into the Pale if they're suicidal
[1:54:22] <iacus_> yes. teh answer is No
[1:54:24] <codymagpie> I want to return to the pale :(

[1:54:51] <%Gruhunchously> Volition?
[1:54:52] <%hax_metatron> It's the "DONT LET IT SET IN" mantra
[1:54:53] <Fabpsi_> bye swamp lady
[1:55:02] <+TheFrancix> she has composure and drama to the max
[1:55:04] <dave_guns> That means his conceptualization is higher than he lets on
[1:55:08] <Treasure_Vault> Yeah you can reload this one, i think
[1:55:09] <BurnySpirit> @CzeekyTV kinda but like there doesn't even seem to be a collective after the individuals gone

[1:55:42] <dreamfillah> SCUM
[1:55:42] <Treasure_Vault> You missed some questions by telling her evrart's plan

[1:55:46] <guiltyboya> LUL
[1:55:46] <elshadow7> That did hurt
[1:55:47] <chainsaw105> bites za dusto

[1:55:53] <quesokano> SCHCUM
[1:55:53] <taeko_ohnuki> WATCH IT FAIL AGAIN
[1:55:53] <%BernieSandworm> it does feel bad to lose 92%
[1:55:54] <stardustcrusad3r> This convo fucks you with no warning
[1:55:56] <Fabpsi_> inb4 another 92% fail
[1:55:56] <notadeasterisk> it happens
[1:55:56] <%Gruhunchously> SCHUM
[1:56:01] <+lordericter> wowwwww
[1:56:02] <%BernieSandworm> even if it happens 8% of the time
[1:56:04] <iacus_> i'm ok with scumming sometimes but come onnnn
[1:56:06] <iacus_> just roll with it
[1:56:08] <notadeasterisk> you're insane
[1:56:09] <linSP> one more ☝️
[1:56:09] <%hax_metatron> Pick up book
[1:56:12] <guiltyboya> Not or honor, but for SCUM
[1:56:12] <%xxMylord> It's Karma for savescúmming
[1:56:14] <codymagpie> 92% fail does hurt a little :)
[1:56:15] <mrblitzstream> 92% i feel ROBBED
[1:56:16] <%hax_metatron> Children's Book
[1:56:17] <Treasure_Vault> Come on dungeonmaster, fudge the roll
[1:56:18] <+lordericter> scumming
[1:56:19] <quesokano> No one is as insane as you, detective!
[1:56:21] <skyenoz> honestly yeah, I'm all for this
[1:56:22] <%X2Eliah> Image if outcomes of all dice rolls were pre-seeded on game start, and re-rolling was not possible
[1:56:22] <spaceitaly> well, at least now I can get up for a drink lol
[1:56:27] <JetpackMcQuack> Evrart wins
[1:56:28] <BurnySpirit> honestly cool with scumming if the fail isn't actually very entertaining
[1:56:32] <iacus_> not quite human xD
[1:56:37] <+Jeshk0> tell her to return to her swamp this time
[1:56:46] <%baka_sugoi> woolieLORE
[1:56:47] <guiltyboya> @X2Eliah shhh, don't give them ideas
[1:56:52] <chainsaw105> seeing all this extra Joyce/Evrart stuff makes me kinda sad I didn't do ANY of Evrart's quests on my first playthrough
[1:56:53] <andre11dr> Also, it was a 92 ,it was kinda bullshit
[1:57:13] <AlphaBankai> Using the wind
[1:57:20] <AlphaBankai> Basically using wind curents
[1:57:22] <Pookiedaexzile> He....just said that
[1:57:28] <primaryfire> using natural ocean currents
[1:57:31] <%BernieSandworm> so you psychologically steer into the wind?
[1:57:33] <+ReallyBigRocks> It involved circular wind currents that took you away initially but then right back to port
[1:57:35] <skyenoz> So taking the long way is actually the fastest... Kinda like what Kims doing with following you and doing side quests
[1:57:35] <iacus_> man I wish ppl stopped with that. It's just maths. 8% chance of failure. Bad luck, that's it
[1:57:36] <elshadow7> Get a point of rhetoric in there for good measure
[1:57:42] <notadeasterisk> go forward to the sea to return home
[1:57:45] <derap41> We've got bands of wind currents
[1:57:50] <Deasmeister> Steering away from home to get home if you want to be poetic
[1:58:03] <AlphaBankai> Basically: go into the pale to discover the world
[1:58:18] <AlphaBankai> Get far from yourself to return to your self
[1:58:21] <skyenoz> It MIGHT seem useless and unimportant but it's the fastest way to solve the case
[1:58:24] <linSP> Shivers take the wheel
[1:58:26] <derap41> Also why it was so hard to reach America
[1:58:31] <IrishHashbrown> Going with the flow
[1:58:37] <quesokano> @skyenoz See, this guy knows what's up
[1:58:45] <+illusiveSaint> it's a skill when you're navigating or for metrology
[1:59:01] <meatman_noplan> by all means
[1:59:03] <%krispen_wa> woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY
[1:59:06] <illTemperedSeaBass> I'm on board the scumming in this scenario.
[1:59:08] <iacus_> fair enough... it's a long convo though
[1:59:16] <Fabpsi_> Mr. Evrart helped me find my gun.
[1:59:16] <Ids560> honestly if you're not gonna play the game again I say scum as much as you want
[1:59:19] <peyodogo> mr evrart

[2:00:46] <%OtakuSnake1> You ever have milk steak?
[2:00:47] <%Burningfajitas> Beer is an underrated cooking ingredient
[2:00:48] <dreamfillah> i can believe that
[2:00:49] <%krispen_wa> sloppy steak

[2:01:04] <DextralMalin> yeah, cooking with alcohol tend to do that
[2:01:08] <skyenoz> Volta do Mar at work
[2:01:11] <dave_guns> Kim discovered Zen
[2:01:13] <guiltyboya> Kim surfing on the insanity
[2:01:29] <andre11dr> I do it with wine
[2:01:41] <BurnySpirit> Kim is the best. Never blocks you, just there for support when you need it <3
[2:01:45] <zanzibarian_hamster> Is he gonna pull out his gun?
[2:01:46] <andre11dr> But i guess beer would also work
[2:01:50] <JetpackMcQuack> we,, it was gary
[2:01:51] <derap41> Kim really just going Wtf are you telling her for
[2:02:04] <heemwizard> @derap41 talking to her feels nice
[2:02:04] <iacus_> technically, it DIDN'T have to be done, but yeah...
[2:02:10] <Johannen> Woolie is so compromised he is willing to spill all the beans
[2:02:20] <BurdRightsActivist> Woolie comprimised.
[2:02:30] <derap41> @derap41 Just can't help opening up telling her everything
[2:02:30] <iacus_> Listen to Kim!
[2:02:35] <%Jeshk0> so compromised
[2:02:40] <zanzibarian_hamster> TL: Shut the f up harry
[2:02:51] <dave_guns> that IS true
[2:03:03] <vasily_kardanov> this stuff is a bit outdated
[2:03:16] <skyenoz> isn't 2 something everyone knows already?
[2:03:18] <%krispen_wa> without volition, woolie cant deal with manipulation
[2:03:45] <derap41> Woolie she is an Ultra Liberal
[2:03:50] <Treasure_Vault> What is her best?
[2:03:54] <derap41> She will do what is best for her
[2:03:55] <Treasure_Vault> What does best look like for her?
[2:04:02] <shincadad> She has power
[2:04:03] <iacus_> depends on what advice you give her
[2:04:09] <dave_guns> she's an ultraliberal, but she likes Revachol
[2:04:16] <vasily_kardanov> actually I don't think the advice matters at all
[2:04:34] <Fabpsi_> she is "insane", and knows knowledge is power
[2:04:36] <Blank9> evrart is a great person
[2:04:36] <derap41> You're talking to a lizard person with no empathy and only transactional thoughts
[2:04:38] <heemwizard> good observation
[2:04:40] <gyrobasel> how close is he to finishing the game?
[2:04:47] <+ReallyBigRocks> Yeah they def have their own motives that have nothing to do with you
[2:04:52] <Johannen> @gyrobasel 80%
[2:04:52] <iacus_> they are both looking for their interests. Joyce is a capitalist rep, Evrart is a corrupt socialist
[2:04:53] <shoonet> joyce is likable and evil. evrart is insufferable and good
[2:04:54] <%Jeshk0> 70-80%
[2:04:55] <mariothemaio> @gyrobasel very close.
[2:05:03] <elshadow7> And then you go and say that LUL

[2:05:08] <+TheFrancix> 3/4 of the game
[2:05:14] <%Gruhunchously> My cinderblock town?
[2:05:17] <BurnySpirit> it's honestly kinda debatable if we ever see what Evrart is really like
[2:05:18] <%ppangboi> calling Evrart good is a bit of a stretch considering his willingness to spill so much blood
[2:05:26] <heemwizard> @gyrobasel might finish it within the week
[2:05:28] <mariothemaio> OUR cinderblock town Joyce
[2:05:30] <BurnySpirit> his greasiness might just be an act for the detective its hard to tell
[2:05:30] <TheMagneticDragon> I prefer insufferable and good over likeable and evil tho

[2:06:10] <iacus_> it seems pretty easy to tell imo. He even admits to teh drug operation
[2:06:16] <%ppangboi> I don't really think you can flatten Joyce or Evrart into simple categories of good and evil.

[2:22:04] <Treasure_Vault> There is a very clear point of no return prompt.
[2:22:15] <%Jeshk0> oh no, that "HO!" sets off the missile strikes! game over man!
[2:22:20] <%Seancicle> FootYellow
[2:22:26] <BurnySpirit> btw it's kind ambigous if like inland is supernatural but are we all just accepting that Shivers is an actual superpower
[2:22:38] <BurnySpirit> because damn
[2:22:40] <Treasure_Vault> EDC is a superpower too
[2:22:51] <%dukenux> man, after this quest and that talk everything will feel underwhelming
[2:23:05] <AlphaBankai> @BurnySpirit Inland Empire is your personal ghosts, Shivers are the city's
[2:23:16] <dewwy125> apocalypse cop harry is pretty much Cassandra imo
[2:23:19] <iacus_> getting pretty late at night
[2:23:21] <mariothemaio> Inland-Shivers best combo
[2:23:23] <SomeAsianDood> brain damaged induced superpowers. basically hdb is kick ass
[2:23:23] <AlphaBankai> @dukenux some momments coming up are really good
[2:23:27] <DextralMalin> bedtime?
[2:23:39] <%Vigonept> Fuck you kim, i wanna be a cryptid hunter

[2:24:05] <BurnySpirit> NO SLEEP ONLY PHASMID
[2:24:09] <%dukenux> :(
[2:24:09] <%Jeshk0> i dont feel hopeful about IDS making progress on that statue....
[2:24:15] <iacus_> why would you play a boardgame now? It's already bedtime
[2:24:15] <notadeasterisk> sometimes
[2:24:18] <+OuchPotatoEX> sometimes you do
[2:24:18] <%cobalt_phoenix_> some of them yes
[2:24:21] <Johannen> Boardgame? Does he mean the Tabletop RPG?
[2:24:23] <derap41> You have an unread book
[2:24:31] <%Vigonept> learn your ABC's
[2:24:33] <%cobalt_phoenix_> like the communist mag, kim chimes in on tip top
[2:24:38] <heemwizard> you already saw it?
[2:24:45] <heemwizard> gotta wait for a bit
[2:24:54] <illTemperedSeaBass> Ya'know, going back to how Kim, and presumably everyone else, have their own stats in their heads, I wonder what Kim's in particular say about Harry's antics. Does his own empathy ever be like "yeah, he's about to go full well-intentioned idiot again."
[2:24:55] <+mechslayer71> @alphabankai espirit I meant
[2:24:55] <Eger007> ыдууз
[2:25:02] <linSP> You down for a 3am DnD sesh?
[2:25:06] <%Gruhunchously> IS there something they want to do tonight? Because they can just go to be otherwise
[2:25:08] <Eger007> sleep
[2:25:10] <OblivionSword1> try again tomorrow maybe
[2:25:24] <mariothemaio> i dont think time passes after 2am so you wont progress on thoughts anymore
[2:25:26] <BurnySpirit> yknow Kim's authority is prob the one that speaks up the most
[2:25:29] <DextralMalin> oh yay, they got the fedora
[2:25:33] <Treasure_Vault> Read books with kim?
[2:25:36] <%Gruhunchously> KappaPride
[2:25:38] <%livlinn> PrideRise PrideRise PrideRise
[2:25:40] <heysamuel> you Connected
[2:25:42] <iacus_> on the church case
[2:25:43] <Fabpsi_> OH, the murder!
[2:25:48] <Fabpsi_> i forgot about it
[2:25:50] <Treasure_Vault> Kim comments on books, sometimes
[2:25:50] <%dukenux> but on the IMPORTANT stuff
[2:25:51] <mariothemaio> what if the murder case was the friends we made along the way :)
[2:25:56] <+AWKWARDL0SER> Yo your ass can afford to pony up $20
[2:25:58] <+Itzdatguy73> Reading with Kim gets extra dialogue
[2:26:05] <SomeAsianDood> @illtemperedseabass according to the merch kims jacket gives him +1 Volta da Mar literally allowing him to go with the flow of Harry's bs
[2:26:07] <AlphaBankai> @mariothemaio this but unironically
[2:26:07] <%Jeshk0> its not a shack, kim, its a HOME
[2:26:08] <%Gruhunchously> Yeah we started out investigating a murder and ended up dancing so hard the city spoke to us
[2:26:27] <DSD24> Dick Mullen is a good book
[2:26:28] <derap41> What do you need to learn before reading=
[2:26:28] <%Jeshk0> yeah Dick Mullen!
[2:26:29] <dave_guns> did Woolie pay for the damages to his room?
[2:26:38] <%Burningfajitas> @dave_guns he did
[2:26:39] <BurnySpirit> the murder investigation is a mislead, the true videogame is talking to strangers until you make them uncomfortable
[2:26:40] <+Sir_Louis> Kim has good comments for the kid book iirc
[2:26:42] <dave_guns> oh nice

[2:30:22] <+ReallyBigRocks> That book is fat as hell got damn
[2:30:35] <BurnySpirit> says the dude in the Dick Mullen hat
[2:30:38] <%SuckerPunchSyd> That book looks about as thick as dune

[2:31:10] <Chatterbox1991> Malcolm is something, i would imagine
[2:31:15] <%Gruhunchously> Thicc
[2:31:18] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> at 10?????
[2:31:18] <Indigo_Automaton> Wow
[2:31:20] <+ReallyBigRocks> political books are rough no matter what. the density is insane
[2:31:23] <%dukenux> 10??
[2:31:28] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Jesus
[2:31:32] <%debrv> Same here, Wools..... God, same here.
[2:31:33] <linSP> Get you a book that’s thicker than it is tall
[2:31:33] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Chatterbox1991
[2:31:33] <SonofMelonHead> Maybe a bit premature
[2:31:43] <AnneSQF> If the book is bigger than your torso, maybe skip it for now
[2:31:46] <+ReallyBigRocks> political texts rather, not books specifically
[2:31:46] <%townzzzzz> hit'em with the war & peace
[2:31:49] <+Telraid> brittle paperback is a fun thing to say
[2:31:50] <spaceitaly> I mean, yeah, people should read Malcolm X, maybe not at 10 tho
[2:31:52] <SomeAsianDood> political theory is notoriously easy for gradeschoolers to understand
[2:31:53] <Chatterbox1991> You must consome Harry Haywood, young Babbie!
[2:31:53] <+Sir_Louis> "Hey Junior, time to read "The Leviathan""
[2:31:57] <shoonet> time stopped moving?
[2:32:03] <Johannen> What is malcolm x?
[2:32:20] <derap41> Didn't we do that for a bit
[2:32:20] <zanzibarian_hamster> Son, you are 10, time to read beowulf in the original babylonian
[2:32:24] <dave_guns> Phoenix Wright must prove he didn't do it
[2:32:28] <dewwy125> @Johannen cooler MLK
[2:32:28] <FassieFons> sounds more like a spiderman plotline
[2:32:30] <spaceitaly> @Johannen civil rights leader, worth a google
[2:32:34] <%cobalt_phoenix_> "we have investigated ourselves and found we did nothing wrong"
[2:32:36] <derap41> Harry thought he might have Murdered the Merc
[2:32:44] <+ReallyBigRocks> @Johannen A major voice in the US civil rights movement
[2:32:49] <%Gruhunchously> That part is realistic, at least
[2:32:58] <%debrv> "Son, you are 8. It's time to read the entirety of Pride and Prejudice!"
[2:33:01] <dave_guns> look I can't judge

[2:33:33] <KyberNasse> YOURE GONNA LEARN
[2:33:35] <linSP> hello euros
[2:33:36] <zanzibarian_hamster> I'm only vaguely aware of him but it was never covered in my education
[2:33:37] <+lordericter> uh oh
[2:33:37] <%Juriasu> he's not as covered in europe
[2:33:38] <naoi0> What
[2:33:38] <+whiskywolfe> Malcolm X founded the X-Men.
[2:33:39] <+Jakeofalco> not america
[2:33:40] <+MrATheGreat> WHAT
[2:33:41] <%dukenux> Someone's dad didn't make him read Malcolm X at 10 Kappa
[2:33:41] <Fabpsi_> worth reading, try to check it out!
[2:33:46] <zanzibarian_hamster> I learned about him from the fresh prince tbh
[2:33:47] <BurnySpirit> honestly I had to find out about him on my own, never came up in school
[2:33:49] <+airchrysalis> he runs a school for mutants
[2:33:52] <BurnySpirit> which seems like a big oversight
[2:33:52] <%Vigonept> malcom x is malcom in the middles brother
[2:33:53] <+fetrigon> @whiskywolfe this SeemsGood
[2:33:55] <bebopdedop281> Megaman spin off
[2:33:58] <%DukeBlack_> Malcom x found genosia
[2:33:59] <+MrATheGreat> Malcom X is also known as Magneto he’s very cool.
[2:34:00] <available_line> That's pretty much it.
[2:34:00] <Treasure_Vault> Yeah that's a good metaphor
[2:34:02] <%Jeshk0> LUL OMG LUL
[2:34:03] <mariothemaio> @whiskywolfe my favorite x-men LUL
[2:34:04] <%sahr_zand> C I A
[2:34:06] <linSP> Malcom man x
[2:34:09] <%livlinn> Nice
[2:34:16] <+illusiveSaint> LUL very nice take knxPWR
[2:34:16] <+OuchPotatoEX> oh how tables have turned
[2:34:17] <sporeian94> COI killed him
[2:34:17] <derap41> Woolie knows how to reach
[2:34:19] <Chatterbox1991> He was assassinated for backing down from his militant ideology by hardliners he used to roll with
[2:34:22] <Johannen> Ok, got it, i know Luther King somewhat, Malcolm X is new to me
[2:34:24] <mariothemaio> and like magneto he was right
[2:34:24] <available_line> Darth MLK
[2:34:29] <andre11dr> I'm Eastern European and yea i had to learn about most black history on my own
[2:34:31] <Chatterbox1991> to my knowledge*
[2:34:31] <skyenoz> Yeah I only learned about him like a year ago
[2:34:31] <+TheFrancix> MALCOM X MEN
[2:34:31] <%Lion_kun> It's also a very long Denzel movie
[2:34:38] <%Burningfajitas> There's stuff pointing to Malcolm X was assassinated by the FBI
[2:34:40] <+Fedhas> go to youtube and look up some of his speeches
[2:34:46] <Tiittamari> yeah this aint taught here in europe, will go look now though
[2:34:47] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:34:50] <naoi0> Race allegory my mutant fiction
[2:34:55] <mariothemaio> FBI took down both X and MLK ;)
[2:34:57] <+airchrysalis> one night in miami has a good portrayal of malcolm x
[2:34:58] <+lordericter> and while its alleged that MLK got killed by the FBI we KNOW the FBI killed Maclom X
[2:34:59] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> I mean, the FBI murdered MLK. I wouldn't put it past them
[2:35:05] <%Irridium> I mean MLK was killed by the government so that'd make sense
[2:35:08] <+whiskywolfe> @andre11dr I’m Western European and yeah, same.
[2:35:12] <+illusiveSaint> it's a Spike Lee joint
[2:35:17] <zanzibarian_hamster> I mean I didn't take history in my country (the uk) and the extent of black history I was taught was just slavery stuff
[2:35:18] <meatman_noplan> Tulsa is the real shit.
[2:35:18] <%Afterman_> oof tulsa
[2:35:22] <Johannen> I only know Tulsa from Watchmen
[2:35:25] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Both were murdered by the government though specifics i dont remember
[2:35:26] <+ReallyBigRocks> @Johannen Honestly he gets kinda glossed over in the US too because of the militarism
[2:35:26] <Dopamien> WutFace
[2:35:28] <derap41> What do you know of Social revolutionaries
[2:35:29] <andre11dr> See i know about Tulsa because of Woolie
[2:35:29] <%DkLordG> Anybody else check out One Night In Miami?
[2:35:34] <mariothemaio> man it's wild how so many people (myself included) learned about Tulsa from the fuckin Watchmen HBO show
[2:35:35] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Oof Tulsa hurts
[2:35:35] <SomeAsianDood> Tulsa is super hard for even Americans it's insane
[2:35:37] <%Irridium> well yeah that would make white people feel bad
[2:35:39] <+rairaku> Not that he was more "militant" he was more about "yo instead of integrating we should bring ourselves up and make ourselves more desirable as a people. Cause we need to be as equal as the white man
[2:35:42] <naoi0> The black panthers’ debut was running away from the cops
[2:35:43] <coreybom> Oh shit we got some conspiracy brothers in the chat huh?
[2:35:43] <%debrv> @andre11dr Saaame.
[2:35:43] <sushahana> nikola tesla?
[2:35:46] <Ids560> learning about Japanese internment at like 18 was weird
[2:35:47] <%livlinn> yea I can bet Asian folks aren't even familiar with this history
[2:35:47] <derap41> The Souths educational system is fucked
[2:35:53] <+Jakeofalco> historic to you
[2:35:55] <%Lion_kun> I'm central European and I know who Marholm X is and watched the movie and the Ali movie with will smith.
[2:35:57] <%Arnoldoaad1> No Joke I did learn of Tulsa from Watchmen, I am from Latin america but still
[2:36:01] <+MrATheGreat> I hadn’t heard of Tulsa and I’m from the southern side of the US. We’re fucked down here.
[2:36:06] <%GHouseduivel> Some parts of the US teach the Civil War as a war of rights and not slavery
[2:36:06] <BurnySpirit> my experience of learning civil rights stuff in the UK was ''racisms bad, US did a racism then MLK did the civil rights movement''
[2:36:07] <derap41> Post war Widows in the south bunch of Karens
[2:36:09] <mariothemaio> Tulsa really just got buried
[2:36:10] <dewwy125> also check out the black panthers
[2:36:10] <+illusiveSaint> a lot of it is learned a lot later in college too which limits the exposure
[2:36:12] <BurnySpirit> like, hilariously barebones
[2:36:14] <%illtima> I don't think American civil history was ever even mentioned back in my highschool in Kazakhstan
[2:36:15] <Treasure_Vault> Did Woolie ever see the Watchman series? I remember he talked about it on the sponsored stream
[2:36:21] <%Lion_kun> I didn't know about Black Wall Street till Watchmen
[2:36:22] <andre11dr> I did find of Mary Turner on my own ,offfff that one is rough
[2:36:22] <%Vigonept> it varies per state
[2:36:25] <Chatterbox1991> Tulsa Race Riots/Black Wallstreet
[2:36:26] <%dukenux> i have a very basic knowledge of american civil rights history, but i did read on Tulsa before Watchmen
[2:36:26] <buffcat> Its getting worse now with the CRT panic shit
[2:36:29] <KyberNasse> What do you mean you don't know Aimo Koivunen Woolie?
[2:36:29] <illTemperedSeaBass> @derap41 Don't pretend for a moment that's a problem unique to the south. The US in general has an unimaginably fucked education system.
[2:36:29] <JetpackMcQuack> We don't teach that :)
[2:36:30] <%Vigonept> i learned about all that shit in arkansas
[2:36:34] <Quigsies> My history teacher insisted the civil war wasn’t about slavery
[2:36:35] <+illusiveSaint> dsaWest dsaWest dsaWest dsaWest
[2:36:36] <heemwizard> @illtima what history did you learn in kazakhstan?
[2:36:38] <derap41> The "state Rights" myth
[2:36:39] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @ghouseduivel I’ve seen people try to teach it as a war of economics 🙄
[2:36:39] <%Irridium> I got to learn about Tuskagee on my own that was a fun time
[2:36:42] <%Vigonept> ableit... in bits then did my own research
[2:36:45] <Fuji808> Tulsa was not a riot. Tulsa was a massacre.
[2:36:53] <%dukenux> ^
[2:36:56] <%debrv> Fuck my Dad told me about Tulsa Massacre....
[2:36:58] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @woolieversus most of the US South has horrible, anti-history history books basically.
[2:37:02] <Johannen> Yeah, we had our own slavery and invaders...so america's history might not be as important
[2:37:02] <Chatterbox1991> shit sorry
[2:37:05] <Karhax> What does Woolie know about Olof Palme?
[2:37:08] <linSP> there’s a lot of “oh yea btw” like the us having their own camps for the japanese during ww2
[2:37:09] <iacus_> !uptime
[2:37:09] <@Moobot> @iacus_ WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 3 minutes
[2:37:10] <%dukenux> "Pogrom" fits what happened in Tulsa really well
[2:37:20] <coreybom> In fairness Tulsa was fucking BURIED in history. Unless you were black with parents willing to teach you, You wouldn’t have known about until the internet.
[2:37:20] <naoi0> Woolie versus history
[2:37:20] <mariothemaio> man so wild how young the internet is to me as a late-20s
[2:37:28] <%illtima> @illtima Mostly our own history + lots of Russia and USSR countries. Almost minimal coverage of US
[2:37:30] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ok i just learned about tulsa and... wtf
[2:37:31] <+Archmortal> the US government worked very hard and still works very hard to suppress this kind of education
[2:37:39] <+illusiveSaint> they assume kids are not "ready" to learn it until college
[2:37:48] <%townzzzzz> majinoDrank
[2:37:52] <fitlog84> Its American history they dont teach it here especially in Oklahoma till now
[2:37:53] <%Irridium> The first black person to attend a school with white people is still alive. She has an instagram account.
[2:37:54] <%livlinn> shiaCry
[2:37:58] <andre11dr> Dude they aren't teaching black history in European schools, especially American history
[2:37:59] <+MrATheGreat> People can martyr MLK and demonize Malcolm X so it’s fine to teach, Tulsa has no lesson except white people are/can be monsters so it’s ‘too evil’.
[2:38:02] <%dukenux> man, but then kids learn about history, and they start doing Holocaust reaction tik toks .. you cant win
[2:38:03] <dave_guns> spillane is a noir author too
[2:38:04] <%Jeshk0> i mean, emmett till would be 80 today...
[2:38:09] <%DukeBlack_> Jessica smollet?!
[2:38:09] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Even still its not super taught in college unless you actively look for it
[2:38:12] <mariothemaio> @illusiveSaint remember, you can't drink until 21 but you can go to war to shoot a gun at 18 :) Murrika
[2:38:19] <dave_guns> that's not how it works, Mullen
[2:38:21] <SomeAsianDood> yes but we can't have our kids learn about critical race theory. amirite?
[2:38:23] <+ReallyBigRocks> @andre11dr They don't really teach it in American schools either
[2:38:25] <heemwizard> @illtima pretty interesting, do you still live in kazakhstan?
[2:38:26] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @jeshk0 pain.
[2:38:30] <derap41> oh no
[2:38:34] <coreybom> @archmortal More of the Right by this point. They think that shit anything that calls out racism is “bad for america”.
[2:38:37] <AlphaBankai> Not enough Espirit to chime in on all the COP BULLSHIT this book is saying. THREE FREE DAYS OFF COURT??
[2:38:42] <%illtima> @illtima Nah. Living in Canada now
[2:38:44] <KyberNasse> Learn history so you can clap when you see it
[2:38:48] <Johannen> Malcolm X was not mentioned in the "history of the entire world i guess" so whatever Kappa
[2:39:07] <BurnySpirit> If you ask the judge very nicely they let you go home and play videogames instead of doing jail
[2:39:10] <andre11dr> I'm still lost
[2:39:11] <Blackleafx> mau mau uprising was horrific
[2:39:16] <AnneSQF> Mau Mau! My favorite anime
[2:39:16] <Blackleafx> in the way the British dealt with it
[2:39:18] <mariothemaio> @AlphaBankai I wish they had a higher EDC, there's so much you can miss about the RCM lore without it. I upped it on my second run and it really was Blue Shivers
[2:39:37] <+illusiveSaint> or the education is anti american, look up the new made up CRT dialogue they're upset it's about history
[2:39:38] <mariothemaio> But this game is amazing for replay
[2:39:38] <%dukenux> or Prussians in Namibia
[2:39:54] <AlphaBankai> Its impressive how much education on racial stuff I got living in Brazil, which was also as colonized as America, but ALSO got through a military dictatorship, we still learn how stuff sucked
[2:39:55] <%Vigonept> i wonder how many people know about the salvadorian civil war

[3:56:05] <mariothemaio> you thought you were playing the game but the game played you

[3:56:41] <%Blackleafx> BASED AND SOBER PILLED
[3:56:42] <%dukenux> Evrart is the epitome of "worst person you know made a great point" meme
[3:56:42] <mariothemaio> there's a hidden check here -- that he resents that they can afford to lose and he can't
[3:56:53] <%Blackleafx> he says, while spiking his workers' lunch with vodka
[3:56:58] <%BernieSandworm> recognition!
[3:56:59] <romc215> #2
[3:57:00] <Pt_Kamen> There's a super hard passive check near the gate the fake scab leader is at. With Woolie's high perception he should go near it and see if it works

[3:57:23] <JetpackMcQuack> For as long as I can remember
[3:57:26] <dave_guns> 7 days considering he was one day in blackout
[3:57:27] <derap41> shakes start at 3-4 days in

[3:57:56] <mariothemaio> alcohol bad but drugs good
[3:58:06] <+MrATheGreat> hey level up
[3:58:06] <elshadow7> Is there a chance this is Edgar and not Evrart? He sounds different. Maybe it's just because Joyce left.
[3:58:07] <dave_guns> alcohol bad, now spike the borchst
[3:58:22] <+mads_valentine> OH FUCK HE HAS A LAZY EYE
[3:58:23] <iacus_> going throuhg all the options of conversation ins the game isn't always wise
[3:58:27] <derap41> @dave_guns Borchst is good for you
[3:58:35] <+mads_valentine> THIS IS EDGAR
[3:58:39] <+lordericter> you could have just played better Harry
[3:58:42] <mariothemaio> @elshadow7 it's never clear but you always get the sense they may be swapping because they look the same. one does have a lazy eye though
[3:58:46] <Pt_Kamen> @mads_valentine the only difference from his twin brother
[3:58:46] <+mads_valentine> Look at his right eye!
[3:58:53] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @mads_valentine wait really?

[4:04:45] <+MrATheGreat> kojkos a slur *reminder*
[4:04:48] <SomeAsianDood> wait did he just drop a slur?
[4:04:49] <elshadow7> The wizard from LotR
[4:04:50] <derap41> really Kojkos the fuck Evrart
[4:04:51] <elshadow7> ?
[4:04:53] <%yusefHD> K word KEKW
[4:04:54] <Prevot> none of these names sound alike evrart
[4:04:59] <mariothemaio> I do like how Acele admits it was her idea to do the drug lab, but she's glad you talked them out of it
[4:05:03] <%Jeshk0> i think he literally killed a guy with a shish keba
[4:05:08] <dave_guns> I don't think Kojko's a slur
[4:05:16] <plsnolookatme> @dave_guns it is
[4:05:18] <elshadow7> Kojko super is a slur
[4:05:21] <Johannen> He took some spoiled meat and killed him by food poisoning
[4:05:23] <AlphaBankai> He won
[4:05:26] <heemwizard> is koijko a slur? dont remember
[4:05:26] <AlphaBankai> Its done
[4:05:27] <SomeAsianDood> kojko's a slur for graad natives
[4:05:28] <%cobalt_phoenix_> strong deflection tactics
[4:05:28] <dave_guns> Oh that sucks
[4:05:28] <%DashXero> @dave_guns It is.
[4:05:32] <%dukenux> Forget it Harry, it's Martinaise
[4:05:32] <TCDerps> I thought kipt was the slur
[4:05:33] <derap41> This investigation is OVER
[4:05:39] <asdief_> what did Gary do?
[4:05:41] <Trace_Bovier> time to get back to the actual investigation lol

[4:05:41] <SomeAsianDood> both are @TCDerps
[4:05:41] <AlphaBankai> Evrat won, nothing more
[4:05:42] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @TCDerps that's the other slur
[4:05:43] <SonofMelonHead> Racist lorry driver uses kojko as a slur
[4:05:44] <WakeUpThrow> The characters who dropped that word until now were Mesurehead and the fat racist driver
[4:05:44] <%DashXero> @TCDerps It is.

[4:05:48] <morow1ec> Evrart doesn't fucking care
[4:05:52] <%dukenux> that can't be the end of the game?
[4:05:55] <%yusefHD> Ayo pls no wire spoilers
[4:05:56] <mariothemaio> I really like how anticlimatic things can be with Evrart. He doesn't care
[4:05:56] <+lordericter> you helped Evrart so you can't try to bust him
[4:05:57] <Hammatime8> Oh well, two bucks materialized in your pocket at least
[4:06:02] <heemwizard> @TCDerps kipt is for black people, kojklo is for the welsh/irish
[4:06:05] <+Telraid> evrart playing 20 dimensional chess

[4:06:26] <SomeAsianDood> that's like saying you were even playing the game woolie LUL
[4:06:27] <AngryAsian5> It was rigged from the start LUL
[4:06:28] <BlackermanZX> goddamn karma houdini
[4:06:29] <dave_guns> at least the kids got off the drug lab for a while
[4:06:29] <Karhax> Evrart is above your level
[4:06:34] <%DashXero> The fattest player in the game.
[4:06:37] <Trace_Bovier> I'm good to keep going if woolie and Reggie are
[4:06:37] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:06:39] <%xcompleasedad> NOT QUITE
[4:06:40] <Martianorbit> Bodied
[4:06:42] <BurnySpirit> Sits in a container for the entire game, acts like the most untrustworthy guy ever and with a few words wins a war
[4:06:42] <Prevot> fat evil always wins
[4:06:43] <HomebaseRED> got played like the cheap kazoo that he is
[4:06:47] <Treasure_Vault> It's a clever tactic for an rpg
[4:06:48] <BurnySpirit> Thaty's Evrart!
[4:06:54] <Ids560> you can walk in day 1
[4:06:56] <%Jeshk0> theoretically day one
[4:06:56] <dave_guns> Also I feel like Joyce was compromised anyway, there was no other route
[4:07:05] <asdief_> what did Gary do tho?
[4:07:09] <derap41> Woolie you're Murders not Major Crimes
[4:07:13] <Karhax> He's less evil than Joyce
[4:07:18] <dave_guns> is Gary in his house with Morell?
[4:07:22] <%madmanrambler> Joyce had no option after the company sent Krenel in despite what she wanted
[4:07:33] <+Telraid> joyce and evrart are pretty interesting opposites tbh
[4:07:39] <%DashXero> Too bad we can't give him a free lead implant...
[4:07:40] <%Jeshk0> evrart was actually one of the first people that i talked to on day one
[4:07:42] <dave_guns> sending Krenel was the fuckup
[4:07:43] <mariothemaio> @Karhax yeah agreed. Joyce is far more likable, but she's rich and you're a cop.
[4:07:44] <elshadow7> It ain't easy to not get played by Evrart when you literally forgot everything about the world...
[4:07:45] <Ids560> you can do a whole lot on day 1 depending on what checks you do
[4:07:47] <Monkeyweed21> Evrart won the moment the mercenaries went rogue
[4:07:47] <%xcompleasedad> @karhax NO. He’s Beria.
[4:07:51] <dave_guns> literally the worst choice
[4:07:52] <derap41> You can ignore all this completely and just do the murder stuff
[4:07:55] <%dukenux> Do you feel like a hero cop, yet?
[4:07:57] <+Fedhas> sunday friend is the real villain of the game tbh
[4:08:02] <%yusefHD> The SMELL OF THE GAME
[4:08:02] <SomeAsianDood> evrart won the moment the mercenaries even arrived
[4:08:04] <dave_guns> in this case is more like antlers and star
[4:08:04] <mariothemaio> Disco Elysium is not a game you play to feel good
[4:08:05] <%xcompleasedad> The guy is the fucking KGB bastard.
[4:08:06] <zanzibarian_hamster> @asdief_ He's a cryptofascist, he was probably spreading bad info and conspiracy theories abou teverart and the crew, the door was a polite way to tell him to shut the fuck up
[4:08:06] <heemwizard> but the commune failed
[4:08:06] <Treasure_Vault> Your team already lost before the round began
[4:08:09] <%ppangboi> @Fedhas truth
[4:08:11] <+purps26> Evrart won once the company responded to the strike by hiring the loincloth crew
[4:08:14] <+lordericter> just don't tell Joyce and be a facist
[4:08:16] <Ids560> there are other communists in the game
[4:08:16] <iacus_> yeah Evrart is more pink than red+
[4:08:18] <Tiittamari> manana's cool
[4:08:19] <BurdRightsActivist> Best commie
[4:08:19] <linSP> you can narc on evrart to the Sunday friend
[4:08:20] <+askalta> these guys are soc dem
[4:08:21] <%BernieSandworm> manana is the best
[4:08:23] <Johannen> He is a boiadero..dont insult him with communism
[4:08:28] <ataxia72> howdy everyone how's it been going
[4:08:29] <Karhax> woolie, Sunday friend or Evrart?
[4:08:30] <DelgotHansto> There's a certain way to come out on top, but it's not really you doing it...
[4:08:31] <%xcompleasedad> @linsp WHAT
[4:08:33] <mariothemaio> Manana is cool
[4:08:40] <%Jeshk0> Wild? Wild Pines??
[4:08:44] <dave_guns> @linSP that's so depressing
[4:08:48] <heysamuel> good shit today lads
[4:08:49] <ataxia72> oh.....
[4:08:52] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh boy tomorrow gonna be goooood
[4:08:52] <Indigo_Automaton> Great stream!
[4:08:56] <heemwizard> see you guys tmr
[4:08:58] <Monkeyweed21> Evrart is a true communist, not because he cares about the individual workers but because he DESPISES the rich @WoolieVersus
[4:08:58] <Martianorbit> Too bad they won’t get the infra-materialism quest.
[4:08:59] <mariothemaio> Sunday Friend is the absolute worse
[4:08:59] <+Fedhas> gg
[4:09:00] <%Burningfajitas> YEEEAH! HARD COOOORE!
[4:09:00] <primaryfire> good prog
[4:09:00] <derap41> only way to "win" is to ignore all the side stuff and just do police work
[4:09:01] <Deasmeister> Eh manana just doesn't want to go to work he even says he's not a communist
[4:09:01] <BurdRightsActivist> We're never gonna get there NotLikeThis

[4:09:02] <BurnySpirit> the end is nigh
[4:09:03] <%Afterman_> that does seem like a good spot
[4:09:03] <karawra> great stream thanks

[4:09:05] <heysamuel> tomorrow's going to be incredible
[4:09:05] <Pt_Kamen> tomorrow might be the end
[4:09:05] <+purps26> do they have any side stuff left? or is it the big time tomorrow?
[4:09:06] <skyenoz> @delgothansto wait how?

[4:09:19] <+Bitscreed> Good sesh
[4:09:21] <+TheFrancix> probably the next stream will be the last
[4:09:24] <Deasmeister> Side content complete
[4:09:27] <mariothemaio> god tomorrow is going to be nuts
[4:09:33] <ataxia72> church dance happened in this stream? gotta catch that VOD with quickness
[4:09:34] <%illtima> You're like 1.5 sessions away from the ending!
[4:09:35] <Ids560> honestly in the choice between people like evrart running the show or mr. price stabilite I'd go with evrart every time
[4:09:36] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> We making some real progress. Shit speeds up a bunch at this point @WoolieVersus
[4:09:42] <DelgotHansto> @skyenoz Moralist Vision Quest, in a way, if you do it a certain way
[4:09:42] <SomeAsianDood> yup @ataxia72
[4:09:44] <Indigo_Automaton> If you do one slightly longer stream tomorrow you can totally finish the game
[4:09:45] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @ataxia72 yeyeye its real good shit
[4:09:45] <+vaderxyz1970> He doesn't care
[4:09:49] <Monkeyweed21> Evrart doesnt care
[4:09:51] <Karhax> Sunday friend, Joyce or Evrart, who would win?
[4:09:51] <+ReallyBigRocks> Problem FAR from solved
[4:09:57] <+purps26> Is he done with side quests?
[4:09:57] <Prevot> Evrart doesn't fucking care
[4:09:59] <mariothemaio> @Ids560 yeah, fuck the moralintern
[4:10:00] <dave_guns> Wild Pines leaves Martinaise. The city is better but the town is fucked
[4:10:03] <linSP> evrart wants blood
[4:10:05] <SomeAsianDood> Watch fail of kim authority check on stream?
[4:10:06] <Johannen> @Indigo_Automaton I dont think that's gonna be nessesary
[4:10:08] <morow1ec> In the end, Mr. Evrart helped you find your gun
[4:10:14] <Martianorbit> La Responsibilite
[4:10:16] <%cobalt_phoenix_> the only thing left i think is the ultralib quest but that doesn't seem to be progressing
[4:10:26] <mariothemaio> Reggie forgot the Chair Battle
[4:10:34] <dave_guns> he pushed the button 30 minutes ago
[4:10:37] <Deasmeister> @karhax Sunday friend wins all this is nothing to him
[4:10:44] <Monkeyweed21> @Karhax Joyce represents a shitty megacorp but she's also a genuinely good person trying her best despite the fact her peers are scum
[4:10:44] <Prevot> Lysanderoth
[4:10:45] <%BernieSandworm> evrart opens by dealing damage, and joyce bribes you LUL
[4:10:48] <mariothemaio> "Harry I wouldn't tell you my plan if you could stop it. It happened 30 minutes ago"
[4:10:50] <+ReallyBigRocks> the mask is fully off now
[4:10:57] <%Jeshk0> nah, evrart isnt really a villain tho
[4:11:20] <TheMagneticDragon> I mean Evrart is trying his damnest to make the system work for others, he just admits he's corrupt in order to do it, Joyce is legit kinda evil
[4:11:26] <Prevot> everyone in power is a villain
[4:11:32] <Prevot> no exceptions
[4:11:40] <%xcompleasedad> @jeshk0 he is SO a villain. The shit he did to get in power…….
[4:11:42] <+MrATheGreat> I’ll disagree. I think Evrart is lying for himself and is thus evil.
[4:11:49] <mariothemaio> My take is Evrart wants to take down Joyce, but only to replace her. He doesn't want to change the system, he just wants to be in control of it
[4:11:54] <Karhax> @monkeyweed21 she could stop the company though, she is just unwilling to sacrifice anything
[4:11:58] <%MTLer> Reggie when are we pissing off your neighbor with farts again
[4:12:05] <Ids560> unsurprisingly, the communist quest has nothing to do with Evrart
[4:12:07] <%dukenux> @Monkeyweed21 is she genuinely good, or is she just really affable
[4:12:16] <TheMagneticDragon> @Prevot Yeah, at least Evrart is straight forward, Joyce just does not care for human life
[4:12:18] <grayskydiver> Melone says that
[4:12:18] <mariothemaio> Or if he does want to change it, it's only so he can control it
[4:12:28] <iacus_> I don't think a guy as slimy as Evrart can even be spun as doing good
[4:12:28] <+askalta> ??
[4:12:29] <%dukenux> OH
[4:12:30] <TheMagneticDragon> @dukenux Affable, she came off as kinda a bitch on my end
[4:12:32] <%Irridium> ???
[4:12:38] <%SuckerPunchSyd> ????
[4:12:42] <+mechslayer71> subtle flex
[4:12:45] <dukenux> i thought you meant the Tesla Coil sounds
[4:12:55] <%dukenux> ???
[4:13:01] <%dukenux> T-thanks Elon?
[4:13:06] <Prevot> now THATS a must have feature
[4:13:11] <%MTLer> it really is
[4:13:20] <TheMagneticDragon> But then again, she is kinda an elon musk in this situation and those guys are never good people
[4:13:21] <mariothemaio> @Karhax Except she straight up sacrifices the dock to the union in the hopes of not causing a war with Evrart
[4:13:29] <%dukenux> reminds me of fart button in 2d GTA
[4:13:37] <Prevot> imagine when all cars are eletric and everyone has fart buttons on their cars...
[4:13:38] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1420054806341816326?s=19
[4:13:40] <%MTLer> yes sir
[4:13:59] <TheMagneticDragon> Conservatives really do tend to be shitheads
[4:14:05] <%MTLer> I don't have that Twitch money's for an X
[4:14:11] <mariothemaio> I think the situation is more complicated than "Evrart bad or Joyce bad", at least in this story
[4:14:16] <%MTLer> yeah 13k$ incentive from gov
[4:14:18] <%KetsuoTaberu> the cyber truck subsidy LUL
[4:14:19] <mariothemaio> in real life, fuck CEOs
[4:14:37] <Prevot> @mariothemaio anyone who thinks either is not bad is compromised
[4:15:00] <dave_guns> @mariothemaio but if things are simple, how am I gonna pass quick judgment?
[4:15:02] <+ReallyBigRocks> I think you can use normal 120v outlets too, but its obviously really slow
[4:15:02] <%ppangboi> @mariothemaio Agreed, I dunno why people keep brushing past Evrart's equal willingness to spill blood in this situation
[4:15:03] <%Jeshk0> yeah, neither evrart or joyce are good, nor are they villains either
[4:15:05] <dave_guns> not simple*
[4:15:32] <Prevot> it is the future
[4:15:36] <Fabpsi_> Question: Is Disco Elysium going strong for "personal game of the year" for you 2 guys?
[4:15:39] <%KetsuoTaberu> A lot of manufacturers are straight up stopping production of gas cars in 10 years too
[4:15:50] <dave_guns> solve your problems by walking everywhere
[4:15:55] <+ReallyBigRocks> Mercedes committed to going all electric by 2025
[4:15:56] <%MTLer> I miss dropping you home after cine Express and getting food from that Chinese place
[4:16:16] <%DatAsuna> emet till would probably still be alive
[4:16:17] <%Burningfajitas> but racism doesn't exist anymore bro get with it /s
[4:16:19] <%dukenux> that does put things in perspective
[4:16:25] <%SuckerPunchSyd> My grandparents were at the i have a dream speach
[4:16:28] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Speech
[4:16:54] <%MTLer> The Blue lagoons
[4:16:56] <+ReallyBigRocks> How nachos saved the FGC

[4:18:29] <mariothemaio> anyway the real answer to joyce bad vs evrart bad is that the Sunday Friend is the bad one, fuck him actually
[4:18:52] <linSP> gotta rewatch my friend martin
[4:19:10] <iacus_> #sundayFriendDidNothingWrong
[4:19:17] <Ids560> Sunday friend is straight up the worst person in the whole game
[4:19:19] <%NotMrDiddles> wooo free sub

[4:21:27] <s_unnyd> ESPRIT DE CORPS [Challenging: Success] - An evening sun shines down on two French-Canadians as they discuss the events of that day. They have stumbled and time-traveled through a world they have grown to love. Their journey is reaching its twilight, but there is still work to be done. Be vigilant, detectives.
[4:21:29] <%illtima> "nOOOOOOOOoo it was fine"

[4:22:52] <+mechslayer71> that was named improperly by the way woolie, wrong title. @woolieversus
[4:22:53] <Treasure_Vault> The last Disco Elysium episode might be named wrong.
[4:22:57] <derap41> What's worse "Yellow Man" or "You're Black"
