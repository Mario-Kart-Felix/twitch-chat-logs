[0:01:40] <BlackermanZX> god that grid caused some actual physical damage
[0:01:50] <lolabunnytetra> so like that means he chooses to sleep in the trash canonicaly? cuz he has this place to stream XD ?
[0:01:52] <%Prevot> its way more complicated than just doing it
[0:01:56] <haisho> I look at it and it's so abstract that my mind just CANNOT accept it
[0:01:57] <%cobalt_phoenix_> EMOSHUNAL DAMAGE

[0:07:31] <+„Çª„Éì„Éº> i think my calc history would be embarrassing not from the equations, but from me constantly running the same numbers over and over like i forgot the answer from 1 min ago
[0:07:32] <%Waage83> I am literally an engineer and i can still fuck op basic math.
[0:07:34] <velgaduere> base 10 is NOT crazy lmao

[0:12:08] <%dds333a> @zephyr1989 Arakune is great
[0:12:09] <drunken_lemur> I mean, I'm just not watching the Miles Morales LP
[0:12:09] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Like he finished disco lmao
[0:12:11] <BobbyDurian> I ended up picking up this game and playing through it on my own because of y'all!
[0:12:16] <Tisaric> literally every stream of this game I've seen more people say they're going to buy it
[0:12:17] <Champstice> Woolie don't finish Ligma
[0:12:18] <Afrosamasenpai> Me with 13 Sentinels
[0:12:19] <%crybirb> I waited to play fully before seeing the LP.
[0:12:22] <%dds333a> @ramasama13 not all the time LUL LUL LUL
[0:12:22] <$Rafraud> I literally stopped watching the Nier LPs, finished Nier, then came back and finished the LP
[0:12:23] <+vaderxyz1970> Woolie but MEEEEEEEEEE though...
[0:12:26] <%Lion_kun> IM GONNA PLAY SO MUCH ELDEN RING WHILE WATCHING ALL THE ELDEN RING STREAMS
[0:12:28] <%jepupu> @dds333a See, you said three too. Which is why I kinda said that it's hard to pick one that would stand out way more than others
[0:12:29] <velgaduere> this person obviously has their own agenda, what a weak excuse
[0:12:30] <+UltimortalMoth> So the takeaway is Everhood is amazing, good. Cool.
[0:12:30] <Ramasama13> shhh
[0:12:31] <SidJDuffy> I wanna be spoiled so I can be convinced to buy this game
[0:12:35] <+Jiggisnipe> Everhood is till in the current Humble Monthly
[0:12:39] <$Rafraud> MIGHT BE
[0:12:41] <%livlinn> You have no idea how many games Woolie sold to me LUL
[0:12:52] <Zephyr1989> I regret watching nier a little bit I'll still play it though!
[0:13:01] <%Jakeofalco> Jakeofalco subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 1 month streak! You better finish the game ! Gotta catch the full streams on YT! And good luck!
[0:13:03] <$Rafraud> WHAT'S THE PROBLEM WOOLIE Kappa
[0:13:06] <Blank9> Fear of the game tanking the end
[0:13:09] <%Mr_Pylon> have a good ol fashioned post mortem
[0:13:11] <Zephyr1989> story is only one part of a game.
[0:13:18] <%jepupu> Honest, I couldn't buy 13 sentinels because of seeing the ending here. But I'm sure as hell going to buy the next Vanillaware game
[0:13:20] <velgaduere> but WOOLIE
[0:13:25] <velgaduere> the masses don't KNOW what they want!!!

[0:14:49] <%dds333a> MMDDYY
[0:14:55] <velgaduere> yesterday things CANNOT REMAIN YESTERDAY
[0:14:56] <jockymongy> God damnit.
[0:14:57] <@Menitta> woolieSPICE
[0:14:58] <Zephyr1989> 2022
[0:14:59] <+vaderxyz1970> üè≥Ô∏è
[0:15:03] <+capybruhArt> March 9th, the 9th March, the sequel to March 8th
[0:15:13] <%Prevot> dont people say it like that BECAUSE they already use the MMDD system
[0:15:13] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:15:13] <CaptainBright> I can even accept YYMMDD, but MMDDYY is just disgusting
[0:15:16] <$Rafraud> Woolie is right, but America is righter Kappa
[0:15:22] <beatie_g> Yo u ready for some EVERHOOD BRO?
[0:15:25] <Blank9> Month is the smallest range of options cmon
[0:15:28] <Zephyr1989> it's February my doods lol
[0:15:30] <powerprotoman> months only go up to 12, so its the smaller unit
[0:15:30] <@Menitta> no YYMMDD is infuriating because NOBODY USES THAT
[0:15:34] <Yomamma1337> @Prevot dont think so
[0:15:35] <%jinking79> imagine asking someone wat is today and they say the year first
[0:15:36] <fIashman92> For some government forms, I'm required to type stuff like 06/June/1970
[0:15:38] <Agent_Sampson> March 9th, 8th's Revengeance
[0:15:39] <@Menitta> EXCEPT MY WORK AND I HATE IT
[0:15:41] <+Jiggisnipe> no smallest, more specific
[0:15:46] <+ReallyBigRocks> YYYY-MM-DD is the actual standar
[0:15:46] <waterstealer> 31/1/2022 is a travesty
[0:15:48] <%dds333a> At work I have to use YYMMDD
[0:16:01] <+ReallyBigRocks> ISO date format
[0:16:02] <BlackermanZX> How bout MYD Keepo
[0:16:02] <Zephyr1989> lol math is difficult
[0:16:03] <CaptainBright> but YYMMDD makes more sense than MMYYDD tho
[0:16:08] <Fnir> also, in most other languages, like French or Russian, you say the day first
[0:16:08] <%sputnikbites> [year][month][day] for iterating on files while at work
[0:16:11] <+ThomasOfTroy> Can't we all just agree that Britian writing out "8 March" is the ultimate cursed format?
[0:16:12] <+EdenOfSecondAccount> fair enough
[0:16:12] <Zephyr1989> it totally does bright
[0:16:13] <@Menitta> We have to use it for fucking engineering drawings.
[0:16:20] <xerotwo> cuz murica
[0:16:21] <Zephyr1989> yet perception matters
[0:16:21] <%Explodincatz> Solution: "MA" with replace "03" when written down
[0:16:21] <powerprotoman> woolie how can you call the unit that only goes up to 12 a larger unit than one that can go up to 31
[0:16:23] <%Prevot> if americans used DDMMYY the language would simply be different, and they'd say 8th of February
[0:16:24] <%Indigo_Automaton> Damn Smarch calendar
[0:16:34] <%Lion_kun> America does it's own thing because they think their own thing is the best and it isn't.
[0:16:41] <+ReallyBigRocks> NotLikeThis nobody uses the actual standard
[0:16:41] <%livlinn> YMD
[0:16:43] <Carlioo> also different languages say dates in different order
[0:16:46] <+Demoli_PT> @WoolieVersus for official documentation in engineering we use year/month/day because its an ever increasing number
[0:16:49] <Yomamma1337> @Prevot non-americans also say february 8th though
[0:16:49] <%arkv01> america is ALWAYS ahead of the curve
[0:16:50] <%Mr_Pylon> America just wants to fuck up everyones databases
[0:16:55] <$Dreigun> I like yy/mm/dd. Best of both worlds
[0:16:58] <BobbyDurian> I mostly use year-month-day because of my job
[0:17:00] <Zephyr1989> we need a better calendar rofl
[0:17:04] <%Reverend_Roscoe> 2Feb22
[0:17:09] <velgaduere> shockingly, the US military does [day] [month word abbreviation] [year abbreviation]
[0:17:14] <CaptainBright> the reason I remember YYMMDD cause that's the national standard for Japan
[0:17:17] <brachydios777> People don‚Äôt usually say the day first when when talking about a day in a month here
[0:17:20] <Zephyr1989> I am American. I getcha
[0:17:28] <waterstealer> YES
[0:17:29] <%Lion_kun> We need to switch a 13 month year with 28 days each.
[0:17:29] <$Rafraud> Cap makes sense
[0:17:32] <waterstealer> LOWEST BY CAP
[0:17:34] <%Prevot> thats stupid
[0:17:38] <@Menitta> what pisses me off the most about Engineering documents using YYMMDD, my school NEVER TAUGHT THAT
[0:17:39] <%mr_sups> That's the way I rationalize it
[0:17:43] <$Rafraud> YES
[0:17:46] <+ReallyBigRocks> ?
[0:17:48] <AnneSQF> yes
[0:17:50] <waterstealer> YOU NEVER USE THAT FOR TIME
[0:17:51] <velgaduere> y'all cowards don't count Blanuary or Smarch smh
[0:17:52] <@Menitta> SURE FUCK IT
[0:17:53] <brachydios777> Huh?
[0:17:54] <waterstealer> THIS IS ABOUT DATE
[0:17:54] <%Indigo_Automaton> That's insane
[0:18:00] <Yomamma1337> YYYYDDMM is the chaotic evil way
[0:18:01] <%dds333a> wuh
[0:18:04] <waterstealer> APPLES AND ORANGES WOOLIE
[0:18:04] <Agent_Sampson> 5Head ?
[0:18:07] <Zephyr1989> nope.
[0:18:08] <nyacoo> 0h20s40m
[0:18:08] <SidJDuffy> the American conspiracy to cause brain damage from reading dates
[0:18:10] <BlackermanZX> insanity
[0:18:15] <Tisaric> hell yeah programmer style
[0:18:16] <$Rafraud> THOSE CONVERSIONS DON'T WORK for this example though
[0:18:18] <%Indigo_Automaton> TIME IS CONVOLUTED
[0:18:19] <+ReallyBigRocks> this is the opposite of your date argument tho
[0:18:21] <velgaduere> that's nesting style
[0:18:33] <Zephyr1989> you're gonna try to make time make sense to everyone around you
[0:18:35] <%Namillus> Hey Woolie have you heard of LANCER
[0:18:38] <+ThomasOfTroy> There's a world map on wikipedia of each country's preferred date format and it's cursed
[0:18:43] <@Menitta> Ok so this begs the question. what's the solution
[0:18:46] <%Indigo_Automaton> The only solution is to abolish all timekeeping
[0:18:49] <+Goblin01> at least thats consistent
[0:18:52] <Zephyr1989> the truth is the solution
[0:18:53] <AnneSQF> nice for sorting
[0:18:56] <velgaduere> LMAO
[0:18:59] <xerotwo> LUL
[0:19:00] <+ReallyBigRocks> I think we should stop using Arabic numerals altogether
[0:19:01] <nyacoo> YYYY-MM-DD with hyphens is the international standard
[0:19:02] <@Menitta> LUL
[0:19:04] <waterstealer> LUL
[0:19:06] <BlackermanZX> LUL
[0:19:07] <+Iamdenril> MM/DD/YY is just wrong we agree on that
[0:19:07] <+ReallyBigRocks> lets invent new numbers
[0:19:09] <+Goblin01> lmao
[0:19:11] <%dds333a> the mental routing LUL
[0:19:12] <velgaduere> engineering MINDS with CROSSUPS
[0:19:14] <Zephyr1989> I wish I had the degree
[0:19:15] <xerotwo> THE ALGORHYTHM
[0:19:16] <%Reverend_Roscoe> I'm an engineer and I main POT
[0:19:18] <%ozzrabbit> The H/M/S thing is kinda invalid because both minutes and second have 60 units in them. Plus, there are 100 milliseconds in a second.
[0:19:18] <+Demoli_PT> my alpha blades go in quadratic equations
[0:19:19] <Triplicat> FUJIYAMA GEISHA

[0:19:26] <GHouseduivel> Factorio but real life.
[0:19:30] <%arkv01> he sees the strings woolieCHAN
[0:19:40] <brachydios777> He solves practical problems
[0:19:46] <velgaduere> the more he reveals THE MORE MYSTERIOUS HE IS
[0:19:50] <+Jiggisnipe> he's good at math Kappa
[0:19:50] <velgaduere> NotLikeThis
[0:19:53] <CaptainBright> earn your PH.D in an engineering field, get a free ticket to the Backyard
[0:19:59] <@Menitta> Fuck yeah engineering
[0:20:01] <Dova573> Chip players sniff glue woolie they aint geniuses
[0:20:02] <%arkv01> yo whats going on in there? you building an armored core?
[0:20:04] <%dds333a> Only geniuses can play,the absolute travesty that is Chipp Kappa
[0:20:14] <Zephyr1989> my name is Jeffrey Allen Holland And I am a dude. autism, furry, probably on a watchlist lol

[0:20:38] <waterstealer> classic bit
[0:20:47] <%jepupu> As a science teacher the podcast gave me grey hairs
[0:20:49] <%dds333a> Damn good skit too
[0:20:53] <Zephyr1989> I also have friends!
[0:20:56] <CaptainBright> algebra is a necessity
[0:21:02] <%crybirb> Is Reggie a cook?
[0:21:03] <%arkv01> @jepupu pass on the wisdom to your pupils
[0:21:03] <Tisaric> programming is like 99% algebra
[0:21:03] <GHouseduivel> You never use math to plan out your time?
[0:21:08] <fIashman92> All basic math is algebra
[0:21:11] <Daxalog> Low level algebra is a necessity
[0:21:12] <%livlinn> OhMyDog
[0:21:18] <%crybirb> @Tisaric That's a huge lie lol
[0:21:20] <Blank9> The most math I use is in RPGs, that may as well be it
[0:21:20] <%Hapsam> cooking is delicious chemistry
[0:21:31] <LarsAndInCharge> algebra is universal just not really spelling it out in equations
[0:21:33] <Zephyr1989> today we're gonna learn about imaginary numbers! lol jk
[0:21:36] <+„Çª„Éì„Éº> rpgs, dps calcs in games..
[0:21:36] <%dds333a> Woolz can't read or calculate time confirmed LUL
[0:21:46] <velgaduere> algebra is more pervasive than most people think
[0:21:49] <CaptainBright> calculus, on the other hand, is not used by the layperson
[0:21:59] <%CaptainInvictus> @WoolieVersus have you ever put out a list of every game you can recall playing?
[0:22:08] <GHouseduivel> Time Management is also big time algebra
[0:22:10] <+ReallyBigRocks> programming is algebra with words
[0:22:11] <@Menitta> i feel the need to tell every time I see a bracketless single line equation.
[0:22:16] <@Menitta> yell*
[0:22:16] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:22:24] <Triplicat> backloggery oys
[0:22:26] <Triplicat> boys
[0:22:30] <%CaptainInvictus> I know lol, I recall there being websites about that.
[0:22:34] <%CaptainInvictus> BACKLOGGERY, that's the one!
[0:22:34] <%dds333a> I imagine
[0:22:35] <GHouseduivel> Jesus
[0:22:41] <Zephyr1989> my backlog is too massive lol
[0:22:46] <%livlinn> clearl19Murrrr
[0:22:47] <%Indigo_Automaton> Can you list every song you've ever listened to? LUL
[0:22:50] <Blank9> I can barely make a list of games I‚Äôve played in a year
[0:22:55] <%Reverend_Roscoe> My steam library is my backlog
[0:22:57] <brachydios777> Bruh
[0:22:57] <Zephyr1989> also broke and my laptop is cordless ROFL
[0:23:00] <lolabunnytetra> I use maths in fighting games mostly, I love me some lab data.
[0:23:06] <%dds333a> How about only games completed Kappa
[0:23:09] <%crybirb> @ReallyBigRocks That is more accurate, but people who link modern programming jobs with math is beyond wrong. In game dev is pretty necessary, mainly Linear Algebra and some Numeric Calculus.
[0:23:19] <BlackermanZX> how many breads have you eaten in your life woolieEVIL
[0:23:24] <Triplicat> making the list is easy, coming to terms with never getting through your backlog in your lifetime is hard
[0:23:37] <+cubbywolf> WOOOOOLIEEEE
[0:23:49] <%CaptainInvictus> yeah sorry, dds333a has it better, I more meant like, games you've finished and enjoyed, rather than every single game you ever touched.
[0:23:51] <GHouseduivel> Yeah, like everyone has played a call of duty
[0:23:55] <Triplicat> because time never stops moving forward.
[0:24:00] <GHouseduivel> From Cod1 to ModernWarfare
[0:24:03] <%dds333a> running in different circles
[0:24:04] <%Indigo_Automaton> @Triplicat Don't do this to me NotLikeThis
[0:24:08] <@Menitta> i bet if h
[0:24:21] <Triplicat> there's even a nintendo direct tomorrowwwwwwwwww
[0:24:22] <GHouseduivel> NBA Jam is a good one as well
[0:24:23] <@Menitta> if I had like 3 hours I could list games I finished
[0:24:25] <%CaptainInvictus> it's super fucking weird because legend of legaia was a game I was wondering if you'd ever played lmao
[0:24:28] <+Axellogic> Wild arms 2
[0:24:32] <%dds333a> I was never part of the FPS crowd, but I was into JRPG's
[0:24:40] <Blank9> Ayyy wild arms
[0:24:48] <+Yc_Black> have you seen the game called Sifu ?
[0:24:55] <+cubbywolf> but you can play every genre
[0:25:14] <@Menitta> You cannot play the football management genre
[0:25:14] <%Indigo_Automaton> Gonna need a Hyperbolic Time Chamber to catch up on that backlog
[0:25:30] <+Jiggisnipe> yep
[0:25:31] <+cubbywolf> true I won't play management sports games LUL
[0:25:33] <Triplicat> oh yeah
[0:25:33] <%CaptainInvictus> yeah definitely
[0:25:37] <megaman_sentinel> Street fighter 2099
[0:25:37] <waterstealer> i'd agree with that
[0:25:38] <Tisaric> woolie I think you're the only one who CAN say that LUL
[0:25:39] <%dds333a> Are you sure about that LUL
[0:25:40] <GHouseduivel> Most "KNOWN" games
[0:25:42] <+Jiggisnipe> especially cuz you find the barrels with the barrel
[0:25:42] <MurseJOCO> Super Nintendo man. Love that system.
[0:25:52] <@Menitta> oh yeah tomorrow we get to bust out the "Don't care about the Nintendo direct" sign tomorrow LUL
[0:25:59] <%dds333a> There are MANY MANY fitegames, but yeah, definitely more than me
[0:26:04] <+Atomic_ColliderSG> the barrel is deep you can lose yourself in it
[0:26:04] <Blank9> Terranigma is the best game most people haven‚Äôt played on snes, for being only out in japan/europe
[0:26:06] <waterstealer> i would put money woolie has played at least half of every fighting game that's existed
[0:26:11] <Triplicat> start scrolling back through that timeline on fighter's generation ThankEgg
[0:26:17] <%jinking79> there r ppl who first game they played in there life is Dark souls
[0:26:20] <%dds333a> using Kawaks LUL
[0:26:28] <velgaduere> to think he could have simply listed off every game he's ever played by this point Keepo
[0:26:31] <MurseJOCO> ZSNES & SNESX FTWWW
[0:26:35] <+cubbywolf> every gamer has a favorite genre. mine was rts but it's fos now because there's no rts games these days

[0:26:54] <+cubbywolf> I member
[0:26:56] <@Menitta> I never did backloggery because it made gaming a job for me
[0:26:58] <%Explodincatz> RIP RTS genre
[0:27:02] <GHouseduivel> @jinking79 Dark Souls also had a huge cultural mark.
[0:27:08] <Daxalog> People kept buying stuff in bulk in sales. No one revisits their backlogger list.
[0:27:15] <@Menitta> now I do the twitter thing of the thread of games I beat
[0:27:20] <%CaptainInvictus> @WoolieVersus backloggery was exactly the sort of thing I was thinking of when I asked that question lol
[0:27:25] <Triplicat> anime has many websites like that also
[0:27:26] <+cubbywolf> company of heroes 3 is coming out. they and total war are it
[0:27:30] <%dds333a> The console I have played the most of is only the PS2 library
[0:27:32] <+ReallyBigRocks> what do you mean you haven't played every videogame?
[0:27:33] <$ArCielArDor> Woolie has played -i Fighting games

[0:36:25] <%Afterman_> jackie chan uncle
[0:36:26] <Furtive_Vulpine> LUL
[0:36:29] <%Afterman_> one mooooore thing
[0:36:30] <BlackermanZX> one more thing LUL
[0:36:31] <hassanico2> Chat turned on the game last time so I wonder how they will react today with full ending context
[0:36:33] <@Menitta> OH AND UH ONE MORE THING
[0:36:35] <%dds333a> the "GOTCHA"
[0:36:39] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> OOOOOOONE MOOOOORE THING
[0:36:39] <%Explodincatz> he couldnt see the finish line and just kept running til he passed out
[0:36:43] <%CoffeeKaiju> YEsssss
[0:36:50] <brachydios777> One more thing
[0:36:55] <%CoffeeKaiju> I didn't know Woolie was a columbo-ite
[0:36:57] <GHouseduivel> JACKIE
[0:37:01] <GHouseduivel> One More Thing
[0:37:01] <+LazyAss24Seven> Gottem
[0:37:02] <+cubbywolf> he ran until his nipples bled
[0:37:02] <Dakuu75> I only know "ONE MORE THING" from Jackie Chan Adventures
[0:37:03] <CaptainBright> seeing Peter Falk roast Sinatra as Columbo still blows my mind
[0:37:06] <SidJDuffy> can already call that this game is on the switch
[0:37:07] <%DkLordG> "My wife loves that little game, Everhood."
[0:37:14] <%CoffeeKaiju> @DkLordG +2
[0:37:22] <hassanico2> Also did anyone tell him about the desynch from the game running for too long?
[0:37:22] <BlackermanZX> GetGianni does an amazing columbo impresion
[0:37:25] <%IGgy_IGsen> Oh boy, it looks like I missed something, we're suddenly an energy being.
[0:37:28] <hassanico2> Which is why the Sun fight was getting a bit rough?
[0:37:35] <@Menitta> "You was sayin you were playin Kingdom Hearts 2 on your PS3....you got the top loadin one right? Well call me crazy but those are backwards compatible...with PS1 games..."
[0:37:36] <hassanico2> @IGgy_IGsen the whole climax, we're dead btw
[0:37:39] <+Jiggisnipe> @hassanico2 I think we did
[0:37:43] <brachydios777> Chose resist for more lore btw
[0:37:45] <bippityjones> Now just one more thing Mr.BanjoFrog, you're a secret boss aren't ya. You see my mother-in-law is somewhat of a secret boss herself.
[0:37:46] <hassanico2> @IGgy_IGsen This is The Waiting Room
[0:37:50] <$tkuwari> Killing is haram
[0:37:51] <GHouseduivel> Frog works part time at an elderly home.
[0:37:54] <brachydios777> *choose
[0:37:54] <Matrixvingian> This feels like Terra's FF6 Esper form.
[0:38:00] <nyacoo> Yeah, try struggling
[0:38:04] <hassanico2> @Matrixvingian feels extremely intentional
[0:38:12] <@Menitta> "My wife, she loves that Frog guy"

[0:39:20] <Champstice> @SidJDuffy Existential Dread, actually
[0:39:23] <hassanico2> Ok I feel Frog is bullshitting
[0:39:28] <Champstice> So not too far off ig
[0:39:46] <ManfredA> Most of the indie games about depression are not, in fact, about depression
[0:39:48] <hassanico2> I assume they were also told about Resisting?
[0:39:56] <%CaptainInvictus> @SidJDuffy why immortality sucks, really
[0:40:00] <+cubbywolf> dank
[0:40:08] <hassanico2> To get more scenes here
[0:40:10] <+Jiggisnipe> think they are gonna resist now
[0:40:14] <%Charronia> I like how the part where other games go "you like killing", this game goes "you like moral complications" limesGiggle
[0:40:16] <Champstice> @ManfredA b-but muh memes about earthtale-like depression games tho!
[0:40:20] <hassanico2> There we go
[0:40:46] <+Jiggisnipe> so Green's insane
[0:40:49] <%notsoy> ah yes, creepy laughing just like in souls games
[0:40:53] <hassanico2> There's nothing TO do Green.
[0:40:54] <%Hapsam> huh
[0:40:55] <+cubbywolf> bored eye
[0:41:00] <$hattrick61> I cant believe we're getting two "in water" endings in a row
[0:41:02] <%Hapsam> thats cool
[0:41:04] <$Rafraud> Therefor its okay to kill you Kappa
[0:41:10] <hassanico2> For reference the 3 hours hallway has apparently 1.3 million tally marks
[0:41:14] <zanzibarian_hamster> I've never heard anyone immortal actually complain about being immortal, game is unbelievable 0/10
[0:41:15] <hassanico2> And each tally mark is 1 year
[0:41:37] <hassanico2> So you couldn't live with yourself?

[0:42:27] <Champstice> We Live(d) In A Society
[0:42:33] <Triplicat> ...immortals being tired of being immortal is a hugely common thing in fiction

[0:42:44] <slackerunchained> In Water?
[0:42:48] <%livlinn> shiaSnack
[0:42:51] <hassanico2> Having an immortal tyrant around also sounds like it sucks
[0:43:04] <SidJDuffy> immortality = infinite gaming
[0:43:27] <slackerunchained> @hassanico2 Just ask the SMT-universe population's opinion on YWVH

[0:43:48] <hassanico2> Also is Rasta a mage?
[0:43:55] <ManfredA> former mage
[0:43:55] <+Jiggisnipe> seems some people got real tired of being immortal
[0:44:04] <%livlinn> joofbHmm
[0:44:20] <@Menitta> you could finish like....3 games on a backlog with immortality
[0:44:26] <%CaptainInvictus> They were alive for millions of years, if green's hallway is any indication. I'm sure some folks wanted it to end eventually.
[0:44:37] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @menitta only three LUL
[0:45:00] <@Menitta> one of them is Train Simulator
[0:45:04] <$Rafraud> @CaptainInvictus So they should have just offed themseleves at that point why did someone HAVE to murder them lol
[0:45:18] <hassanico2> @Rafraud Recall that the Lost Souls are STUCK in this realm
[0:45:27] <%Indigo_Automaton> His echoing nyehs LUL
[0:45:39] <+cubbywolf> the evils of science
[0:45:39] <%CaptainInvictus> @Rafraud the point is that only red/pink has the ability to actually kill them for real, otherwise they just return
[0:45:41] <Triplicat> AND I'D DO IT AGAIN
[0:45:46] <+Atomic_ColliderSG> man this exposition dump NotLikeThis
[0:45:50] <hassanico2> Even just suicide doesn't mean you get out, you're just stuck in here forever because the universe won't reset

[0:47:03] <%crybirb> This is so edgy
[0:47:03] <hassanico2> I think the only one left is the Frog scene they got last time
[0:47:07] <%CaptainInvictus> and then let it go I guess
[0:47:15] <+Jiggisnipe> purple, gold, orange, blue, green

[0:56:36] <hassanico2> The long survival before you can fight is pretty mean
[0:56:37] <+kewlmyc> This would make me sick to my stomach
[0:56:46] <Tisaric> I love this kind of UI destruction while you're playing
[0:56:49] <Tisaric> it's so fucking cool
[0:57:07] <@Menitta> UI destruction is the best kind of 4th wall breaking
[0:57:07] <velgaduere> doesn't seem to be any bullets left

[0:57:59] <Tisaric> the motif though
[0:58:01] <+cubbywolf> yeah that he bar looks like you should kill it
[0:58:04] <Furtive_Vulpine> this sounds like the beginning of that one eminem song

[1:01:31] <$Rafraud> Jk
[1:01:36] <hassanico2> Damn it gets tougher as its hp decreases
[1:01:36] <%Hapsam> this whole sequence is like butt clenching for an hour
[1:01:49] <hassanico2> It threw in a buncha green lines when it took damage
[1:01:53] <Tisaric> nah it's getting easier
[1:01:53] <$Rafraud> Kinda loop
[1:02:02] <+„Çª„Éì„Éº> im just watching and im tensing up on some of those hops
[1:02:06] <slackerunchained> It seems to be getting easier. Maybe SKYNET *wants* to be terminated?
[1:02:07] <JayCue_yt> man If I was streaming this game I'd hate to shit myself right at this exact part
[1:02:12] <Iza_kku> chat, what am i looking at
[1:02:28] <%Indigo_Automaton> @Iza_kku Attacking and Dethroning God
[1:02:31] <hassanico2> Ah I see, the end of the loop is the tough part
[1:02:34] <Iza_kku> gotcha
[1:02:38] <hassanico2> So every loops ends with a long green note segment
[1:02:41] <Furtive_Vulpine> woolie versus god deluxe edition

[1:07:06] <hassanico2> I don't wanna say Woolie is playing too safe given how tough this is but he is SUPER relying on those piano notes
[1:07:24] <Tisaric> it's hard to find openings outside of the piano notes
[1:07:26] <Thelaughingrouge> truly the dark souls of rhythm games

[1:08:35] <ManfredA> I wasn't here, why did people think the story turned sour
[1:08:45] <%Hapsam> story was always good
[1:08:47] <$Rafraud> Is there endlag movement wise after shooting?
[1:08:53] <+Jiggisnipe> we're lacking context
[1:08:54] <+TwitchGuy2021> It‚Äôs pretty impressive how the main character went from barely beating some people in a race, to destroying the physical embodiment of the entire universe, in about two days.
[1:08:55] <%CaptainInvictus> yeah, just surviving during the long strings of green section and only shooting during the wide greens sections seems like the best idea
[1:08:58] <%Hapsam> it just said that the american time format was the correct one and everyone got salty

[1:09:48] <+za7az> What's the name of the song?
[1:09:51] <ManfredA> it's not
[1:09:55] <jimgimp> They were trying to send too many conflicting messages basically
[1:09:57] <$Rafraud> don't you feel BAD yet?
[1:09:59] <Furtive_Vulpine> i liked this game up until the time cube started ranting about limp dick lawyers and chickenshit bureaucrats...
[1:10:00] <Tisaric> @anoldtoilet it has one moment like that but it's not really what it's about
[1:10:07] <ManfredA> I assume they're talking about when Pink starts saying you were the one controlling them
[1:10:17] <ManfredA> but nothing indicates that they're not culpable
[1:10:23] <Tisaric> it really struggles to land the ending with a bunch of messages yeah
[1:10:24] <BlackermanZX> this is how canonically how the universe is gonna end
[1:10:29] <velgaduere> @Furtive_Vulpine what do you mean? that cemented this as one of the greatest political games ever made!
[1:10:34] <BlackermanZX> by a pink guy fighting god
[1:10:38] <leith_aziz> @Tisaric Something wrong with that? I assume it's one of those situations where you just say "No, I didnt enjoy it..." cohhHmm
[1:10:40] <AngryAsian5> Really like the music in this fight. It's pretty chill despite how hectic this battle looks. LUL
[1:10:40] <%Hapsam> i liked the game until it said that pouring milk before cereal was the correct way
[1:10:42] <velgaduere> stack brains
[1:10:49] <%CaptainInvictus> @Tisaric it's more about how immortality fucking sucks, but the game suffers from a few pitfalls of your average 1-2 person dev team
[1:10:59] <leith_aziz> pickyFocus
[1:10:59] <+anoldtoilet> LUL i just realized woolie is playing as the weird pink ghost from that time he died in the incinerator

[1:13:40] <ManfredA> @hassanico2 I understand people being confused but I really do think this is why absorbing stories with a filter in between you and the game has its disadvantages

[1:15:24] <%Explodincatz> Partytory
[1:15:26] <+robertoszek> @Shad0wTag Asura's Wrath taught me to always punch the buddah
[1:15:26] <Tanairium_> wait so even in death you still live forever
[1:15:34] <Triplicat> they absolutely should not have ever put the word "game" in the script lol

[1:15:41] <puluxor> KILL
[1:15:42] <Triplicat> not now and not when purple mage said it before
[1:15:42] <+vaderxyz1970> commit suicide to see all your friends and family!
[1:15:52] <%townzzzzz> "THANKS FOR KILLING ME"
[1:15:53] <Furtive_Vulpine> cirYep
[1:15:54] <BlackermanZX> oh a party in purgatory
[1:15:54] <$Rafraud> WHAT DOES THAT MEAN
[1:15:55] <T_Sasquatch> I feel like i missed alot. Wtf happened
[1:15:56] <AngryAsian5> Wut?
[1:15:59] <$Rafraud> BRO IM OUUUUUUTTT
[1:16:00] <%cobalt_phoenix_> WHAT EVEN
[1:16:00] <%Prevot> ???
[1:16:01] <+anoldtoilet> rofl
[1:16:04] <+Jiggisnipe> @Triplicat yea I don't think this script needs meta
[1:16:05] <%Mr_Pylon> \
[1:16:09] <+Fetrigon> ??
[1:16:12] <%livlinn> shandTofu
[1:16:16] <Pookiedaexzile> Your are simply the Knive, not the Killer?
[1:16:23] <+anoldtoilet> lmao telling the player the game is good at the end
[1:16:25] <Furtive_Vulpine> can you kill everyone again and send them to super hell
[1:16:30] <+anoldtoilet> "its been awesome. incredible. i swear dude"
[1:16:39] <Champstice> I feel like some weird lines are probably a result of Eurojank phrasing to be honest
[1:16:40] <arkvc> is this secretly a religious shill?
[1:16:42] <%Indigo_Automaton> Yes
[1:16:42] <hassanico2> Seeya
[1:16:42] <+„Çª„Éì„Éº> ah.. huh.. yes.. got it *backs away*
[1:16:43] <Thelaughingrouge> "now, go kick that budda guys ass."
[1:16:44] <Tisaric> I really wonder if putting "game" in the script kind of comes from the devs not being english native
[1:16:47] <%robosqueeb> welcome to dance heaven
[1:16:50] <+ReallyBigRocks> reincarnation as a service
[1:16:58] <Furtive_Vulpine> one of these guys is gonna get reincarnated into a bug and die instantly
[1:17:01] <Champstice> @Tisaric Yeaaaah
[1:17:01] <leith_aziz> pickySad
[1:17:04] <slackerunchained> Yeah. i get what the game is trying to portray, here, but this doesn't seem like the 'end of existence' that the folks, here, were seemingly striving for...
[1:17:08] <+Jiggisnipe> Poor Haley
[1:17:08] <%Lion_kun> See Woolie it's good you murdered them, you sent them to heaven.
[1:17:14] <+anoldtoilet> yeah!
[1:17:18] <%Zephyr1989> oof
[1:17:21] <$tkuwari> uhhhh
[1:17:22] <+capybruhArt> uhhh yeah i hate this moral
[1:17:23] <+anoldtoilet> frailty but its a cute video game with funny monster friends
[1:17:24] <Pookiedaexzile> Victim Blaming
[1:17:27] <%Zephyr1989> nevermind
[1:17:29] <+BigBruthaThunda> Murder is always good tbh
[1:17:29] <+vaderxyz1970> wow
[1:17:29] <+TwitchGuy2021> @t_sasquatch We killed everyone and they were angry about it, because we did it without their consent, but now that they‚Äôve seen what happens after they‚Äôre happy.
[1:17:31] <+anoldtoilet> what a crazy game
[1:17:32] <morow1ec> Thanks for becoming a mass murderer for us Pink
[1:17:33] <Yomamma1337> @slackerunchained they just wanted their current situation to end, this is that
[1:17:35] <SidJDuffy> so they wanted to stop existing only for them to be immortal in purgatory and somehow funding it all cool and dandy?
[1:17:38] <StebTheVee> that smile
[1:17:47] <velgaduere> GROOOOT oh.
[1:17:50] <$Rafraud> @Furtive_Vulpine See but then you just reincarnate again
[1:17:52] <hassanico2> @SidJDuffy this is the waiting room, not purgatory
[1:17:53] <Thelaughingrouge> turns out this game is Woolie's Mom approved.
[1:17:54] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Grundal!
[1:17:55] <ManfredA> They wanted to stop being stuck in a shit situation for actual millions of years
[1:17:58] <leith_aziz> @Tisaric What, is the word too on the nose for you? I dont mind it cohhHmm
[1:18:02] <+Jiggisnipe> so Orange was a dick
[1:18:07] <BlackermanZX> fuck you eggman lookin ass
[1:18:10] <+vaderxyz1970> This is the 13 reasons why the game
[1:18:14] <%Zephyr1989> gg
[1:18:15] <+anoldtoilet> lmao vader
[1:18:17] <Pookiedaexzile> When you try to explain Acid to your friends the next day
[1:18:22] <%Zephyr1989> well played
[1:18:27] <%Indigo_Automaton> @slackerunchained It's not about ending existence, it's about reentering the cycle of souls. In the context of this game's reality Immortality is denying what is supposed to be a natural cycle of life and death
[1:18:28] <Triplicat> so anyway zeroranger...
[1:18:40] <ManfredA> yes, it's about samsara
[1:18:40] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:18:42] <leith_aziz> Eggman cohhSus
[1:18:44] <%CaptainInvictus> so what it seems is going on here, is everyone had to die so that everyone could be reborn?
[1:18:53] <hassanico2> Exactly
[1:19:03] <+anoldtoilet> oh my god i just got it
[1:19:04] <zanzibarian_hamster> None of you read houseki no kuni or play DDS?
[1:19:04] <hassanico2> The immortals still being around meant that everyone who DID die was stuck
[1:19:17] <+Goblin01> im 30 and this is deep
[1:19:18] <+anoldtoilet> its western devs making a game using buddhism the way japanese devs make rpgs about christianity
[1:19:25] <$Rafraud> @Goblin01 Kappa
[1:19:26] <%CaptainInvictus> @zanzibarian_hamster not everyone has experienced everything
[1:19:29] <ManfredA> One of the guys is Indian
[1:19:36] <Pookiedaexzile> It won't be "YOU" you idiot
[1:19:47] <+Fetrigon> @anoldtoilet OMEGALUL
[1:19:49] <+mechslayer71> did I tune in for r
[1:19:50] <Daxalog> bro
[1:19:51] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[1:19:52] <hassanico2> LUL
[1:19:52] <Triplicat> JUST NOW?
[1:19:53] <GHouseduivel> FAT ASS
[1:19:54] <velgaduere> HUGE dumpy
[1:19:55] <Zomner> LUL
[1:19:55] <+anoldtoilet> wtfWaha
[1:19:56] <leith_aziz> WOOLIE! pickyPalm
[1:19:57] <Yomamma1337> woolie just noticed lol
[1:19:57] <FrostedZaibatsu> omg
[1:19:59] <%cobalt_phoenix_> NOW you notice?
[1:19:59] <%arkv01> @anoldtoilet so instead of dethrone god, its commit genocode (with consent)?
[1:20:00] <+mechslayer71> did I tune in for the end?
[1:20:05] <Champstice> Yeah
[1:20:06] <+Fetrigon> pls no
[1:20:08] <+robertoszek> truly LP blindness
[1:20:08] <+Jiggisnipe> Woolie was too busy surviving to notice
[1:20:12] <Yomamma1337> @arkv01 (with partial consent)
[1:20:16] <$Rafraud> Genocide is AOKAY
[1:20:20] <%Hapsam> woolie has a heart of stone
[1:20:21] <leith_aziz> Im not Gaunter O'Dimm, Knight
[1:20:21] <slackerunchained> Pink is a stone-cold B*tch.
[1:20:26] <hassanico2> ...wait you just turned transparent
[1:20:29] <Thelaughingrouge> pink trying to fight the beat but he's to dummy thicc
[1:20:31] <nyacoo> A little bit of consent
[1:20:35] <%Prevot> LUL
[1:20:38] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> gotta pay rent or leave bruv
[1:20:40] <@Menitta> thanks Tinker Knight
[1:20:41] <%Zephyr1989> welp. they told me the devil was attractive
[1:20:41] <+BigBruthaThunda> @arkv01 no most told you not to
[1:20:43] <ManfredA> I think people trying to draw parallels to undertale leads to a lot of muddying of what it's portraying
[1:20:51] <+Goblin01> fractional consent.
[1:20:54] <ManfredA> it's not really that similar beyond having a kill route
[1:21:00] <Champstice> @ManfredA Yeah that too
[1:21:01] <GHouseduivel> Double Cheeked up, on a Thursday afternoon.
[1:21:02] <leith_aziz> @ManfredA You think? pickyThink
[1:21:02] <%Indigo_Automaton> All the lost souls you encountered were literally trapped in Everhood because the other souls refused to die and move on. Their immortality was selfish
[1:21:04] <zanzibarian_hamster> @CaptainInvictus Obviously, I'm just saying, this game is very surface level "DUDE, TRANSCEND THE KARMIC CYCLE, LMAO" stuff
[1:21:08] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Disco Jimmy
[1:21:14] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Oh god
[1:21:15] <hassanico2> @zanzibarian_hamster drugs haha
[1:21:22] <%SuckerPunchSyd> I love them so much
[1:21:23] <%Zephyr1989> I have to die or does he?
[1:21:24] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[1:21:26] <Triplicat> Ha ha!
[1:21:27] <%CaptainInvictus> @zanzibarian_hamster yeah, I get it
[1:21:28] <BlackermanZX> LOL
[1:21:28] <%cobalt_phoenix_> LUL
[1:21:35] <+vaderxyz1970> so...........
[1:21:38] <+robertoszek> anytime
[1:21:39] <$Rafraud> BUT THE WORLD REFUSED TO CHANGE
[1:21:41] <+anoldtoilet> they all love being killed by you
[1:21:46] <Pookiedaexzile> The Slimes should hate you
[1:21:50] <+sewermonk> I warned you about getting trapped in cycles of guilt bro
[1:21:57] <hassanico2> Imagine being a tree for millions of years, that would suck
[1:22:08] <$Rafraud> HES SO HAPPY
[1:22:08] <+Krasmeyts> KKona Hey, bruther~
[1:22:08] <+capybruhArt> relatable
[1:22:09] <velgaduere> @sewermonk I warned you about Jacob's Ladder bro
[1:22:12] <$Rafraud> TO BE MURDERED
[1:22:12] <%Lion_kun> Thank you for committing genocide
[1:22:13] <+Flarepulse> oh damn, I missed the light show
[1:22:20] <leith_aziz> @hassanico2 That Fallout 3 mission pickyLurk
[1:22:21] <+KisukeOboro> I guess I'm glad I was murdered against my will
[1:22:26] <+anoldtoilet> apologizing for making you kill him but he also loves being killed
[1:22:28] <Tisaric> yeah it's pretty much the most surface level psychedelic realizations as a story, but hey the gameplay fuckingrules
[1:22:35] <SidJDuffy> so we're trading one immortality for another I guess. Missed opportunity (?) for further commentary. Not that I have much context on what even is going on.
[1:22:54] <+vaderxyz1970> Ok so what if we replaced Red/Pink with Jason or Freddy, is it the same
[1:22:58] <+Goblin01> your genocide was noticed and appreciated.
[1:23:02] <+Jiggisnipe> they
[1:23:04] <slackerunchained> I think the problem is, that people can grasp that, yes, bad stuff tend to accumulte over a long enough lifetime... but people still both fear death, at heart, all the same, as that's natural, and human beings simply really can't *comprehend* nonexistence, as existence defines their entire - um - 'existence'.
[1:23:04] <$Rafraud> Still thick
[1:23:07] <%robosqueeb> booty is booty
[1:23:08] <Yomamma1337> dont think they ever specify
[1:23:10] <%CaptainInvictus> I think everyone in this game uses genderless pronouns
[1:23:10] <Daxalog> Pink looks like snake when standing sideways
[1:23:13] <geekpatientzero> Everyone in the game is they
[1:23:17] <BlackermanZX> could be both
[1:23:20] <nyacoo> It's been so long they don't remember
[1:23:20] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Still gotta dumpy tho
[1:23:27] <T_Sasquatch> Pink color = girl obviously
[1:23:29] <HR_Freud> I think there'd be some backschlong
[1:23:31] <hassanico2> why is the signpost a soul
[1:23:32] <%Hapsam> blue is cool
[1:23:33] <+TwitchGuy2021> @vaderxyz1970 Yeah, pretty much.
[1:23:34] <$tkuwari> aw blue
[1:23:37] <Champstice> Having a dumpy is gender-neutral
[1:23:46] <leith_aziz> I feel like some people are overexposed to some concepts that they're a mix if turned of/missing the point here. Anyway, it's clear I've missed soem stuff from last stream cohhHmm
[1:23:56] <$Rafraud> ONLY ONE
[1:23:56] <hassanico2> Only some people are waiting here
[1:23:57] <+anoldtoilet> this is so funny because most games would try to have like, some ambiguity here
[1:24:06] <%Hapsam> only some waited for you
[1:24:07] <+anoldtoilet> but this game seems really dedicated to telling you no, you did a great job. its awesome
[1:24:15] <AppleBerryKitty> wait, did woolie ever kill that ghost?
[1:24:21] <%Mr_Pylon> clap for murder
[1:24:24] <+cubbywolf> LUL
[1:24:30] <Tisaric> I mean, the killing was a good thing in the context of the game
[1:24:36] <+vaderxyz1970> hmmmmm
[1:24:37] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @appleberrykitty the ghost in the tunnel? Yeah he did
[1:24:37] <$Rafraud> Killing is fine
[1:24:39] <+cubbywolf> I agree. immortals are immoral
[1:24:40] <Tisaric> it was a good job
[1:24:47] <+Jiggisnipe> still need more context I think for how the world works
[1:24:51] <%CaptainInvictus> @anoldtoilet did you follow any of the prior streams? it was basically about how immortality sucks when you've been around for millions of years
[1:24:52] <%X2Eliah> So this game basically teaches you that people will thank you for killing them
[1:24:52] <+projectmanatees> they were going mad
[1:24:53] <nyacoo> Killing is A-OK if you're in the right
[1:24:56] <AppleBerryKitty> yeah the tunnel, thanks.
[1:24:59] <BlackermanZX> so the souls are returning to a normal life cycle is my guess
[1:24:59] <slackerunchained> This whole spiel sounds a (lot* like a case of Sour Grapes... :\
[1:25:04] <hassanico2> Ok so imagine you're holding reality hostage
[1:25:09] <HotSauceFiend> woolie looking forward to hollowing out as an immortal being
[1:25:09] <Pookiedaexzile> No Wooiie Its fine, We're making a movie about how cool it was when red killed everyone
[1:25:10] <+TwitchGuy2021> @anoldtoilet I‚Äôm glad. I get annoyed when games guilt trip you.
[1:25:10] <notabrobro> you killed the sign too? geez
[1:25:12] <Yomamma1337> @X2Eliah well only if you have confirmation of the afterlife
[1:25:16] <ManfredA> I think people are just hardwired into killing is bad because of certain other indie games so they sorta wanna hammer it home here
[1:25:21] <Blank9> This just reminds me of FF3 how they had immortals and one of them gifts another mortality
[1:25:25] <Champstice> @anoldtoilet People have been missing the point in prior streams too tbf
[1:25:25] <+BigBruthaThunda> everyone focusing on the murder, but remember, suicide is awesome too
[1:25:34] <+za7az> I'm guessing that the implication is that if the soul and reincarnation exists then there is no need for physical immortality?
[1:25:37] <hewsped> the philosophy at the end is weird
[1:25:38] <Tisaric> It's much more about how humanity/whatever these people are now aren't really wired for immortality
[1:25:38] <Blank9> And he flips out he‚Äôs going to die and becomes the big bad
[1:25:49] <Tisaric> and it's going to cause major issues over enough time
[1:25:49] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:25:56] <slackerunchained> It's only really a 'good' ending because the game's internal logic *says* it's a good ending.
[1:25:56] <Furtive_Vulpine> LUL
[1:26:01] <Zomner> lol
[1:26:03] <+undersea_magic> atpDance atpDance atpDance
[1:26:08] <Yomamma1337> @slackerunchained yes thats how logic works
[1:26:09] <%livlinn> This is still giving me a war flashbacks from a certain Shonen manga joofbSweat
[1:26:10] <HotSauceFiend> more like physical immortality is a poorly tgought out concept until you realize the concept of eternity
[1:26:14] <+vaderxyz1970> Immortal and perpetualy sick
[1:26:28] <%robosqueeb> schizo fish
[1:26:30] <slackerunchained> @Yomamma1337 Wuiet, you!
[1:26:30] <Yomamma1337> @slackerunchained you have to take the rules of the world into account when you make moral judgement
[1:26:31] <Blank9> It‚Äôs a good ending because it‚Äôs not nonexistence after death
[1:26:31] <nyacoo> OK?
[1:26:34] <ManfredA> I think people will change their mind real quick if they go do the 3 hour corridor full of tally marks
[1:26:35] <+anoldtoilet> this reminds me of the kaathe ending in ds1
[1:26:54] <+BloodyBurney> its like, i get it, i get the point, but maybe it could have been made a bit better
[1:26:56] <HotSauceFiend> is immortality worth it if you degrade into an unrecognizable being
[1:26:58] <BlackermanZX> eons damn
[1:27:03] <+anoldtoilet> dark souls also has a pretty strong buddhist theming behind it all i think
[1:27:05] <kingra> @Blank9 This.

[1:27:12] <ManfredA> precisely
[1:27:13] <HotSauceFiend> the story definitely couldve used more lore notes
[1:27:21] <%SuckerPunchSyd> How many decades
[1:27:22] <+vaderxyz1970> But now they might be a cow
[1:27:22] <Pookiedaexzile> Light being still grooving
[1:27:27] <+ReallyBigRocks> tf even is time?
[1:27:29] <+za7az> So they didn't know that the soul was a thing???
[1:27:32] <hassanico2> At least 1.321 millions
[1:27:35] <+vaderxyz1970> in America
[1:27:36] <%Indigo_Automaton> @SuckerPunchSyd Millions of years actually, according to the tally hallway
[1:27:37] <%CaptainInvictus> @BloodyBurney yeah not everything is flawlessly crafted.  I think they did a pretty good job for two dudes
[1:27:39] <HotSauceFiend> but all the characters way of talking and surroundings also play into how immortality has affected them
[1:27:39] <+BigBruthaThunda> " but what if I make a dog water story? aha then killing yourself is ok"
[1:27:46] <%livlinn> Don‚Äôt‚Ä¶thank‚Ä¶mass‚Ä¶killing‚Ä¶please NotLikeThis
[1:27:49] <Tisaric> I forgive all the story hiccups considering it's a 2 dev team, I think they at least put together a tangible and followable story
[1:27:54] <BlackermanZX> monkaS
[1:27:56] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @indigo_automaton oh god!
[1:27:58] <+Jiggisnipe> immortality didn't affect everyone the same
[1:27:59] <leith_aziz> Hi Ganon
[1:28:00] <lol_red_ranger> "I'd be right happy to"
[1:28:03] <+capybruhArt> i think i'm hating this because it avoids a materialist read by just making up rules about how the universe works and while it makes for a interesting thought experiment it wreaks havoc on whatever actual commentary it's attempting (which I might only assume it to be making due to its proximity to UT) OST still bumps tho
[1:28:08] <hassanico2> Yeah imagine being a super materialist for eons LUL
[1:28:22] <powerprotoman> in the immortal words of sonic the hedgehog "what good is a world that goes on forever"
[1:28:29] <HotSauceFiend> just remember the hallway starts from when Green actually started to record the years. not including the lost time from before i think

[1:28:50] <+Toblo1> BREAK IT'S LEGS!
[1:28:55] <%CaptainInvictus> @capybruhArt it's following a reincarnation cycle world setting, which isn't a new concept. they had formed PHYSICAL immortality, which is not the same and it was not good for them mentally
[1:29:00] <Yomamma1337> @capybruhArt making assumptions about morals without taking into account the worlds rules is itself some form of commentary
[1:29:04] <Thelaughingrouge> I don't know about this ending... like I get what its going for and what its trying to say, but I think it doesn't hit the way they want it too.

[1:40:13] <Tisaric> the catboss is the hardest fight
[1:40:14] <+Jiggisnipe> @BlackermanZX it didn't, new game + is one more thing, also the cat is one more thing
[1:40:21] <$Rafraud> HMMMM
[1:40:22] <%cobalt_phoenix_> hooo boy
[1:40:25] <ManfredA> the cat is the NG+ thing
[1:40:27] <%Zephyr1989> I am not cat face! lol
[1:40:38] <GHouseduivel> MY EYES
[1:40:39] <%Lion_kun> I don't like games that tell you to kill all your friends.
[1:40:39] <SidJDuffy> why is "Discord Moderators" in the end credits so hilarious to me lol
[1:40:44] <Yomamma1337> press a button?
[1:40:46] <%Charronia> Warning for anyone who has eyes
[1:40:48] <BlackermanZX> the last battle too
[1:40:52] <%Zephyr1989> same lion. same....
[1:40:53] <GHouseduivel> @SidJDuffy Shouting out your friends?
[1:40:54] <SomeOtherNeb> press a button?
[1:40:57] <nyacoo> It had to be blue and red, the pokemon seizure colors
[1:40:58] <%Giothegame> Damn did I miss the end?
[1:41:06] <%Zephyr1989> still this was a journey worth going on
[1:41:06] <+anoldtoilet> @Lion_kun don't worry, they'll love it and apologize to you for making you do it in the afterlife
[1:41:08] <%livlinn> roryvaPop
[1:41:11] <%CaptainInvictus> @SidJDuffy because it's such a small development team that they were appreciatave of even the smallest folks?
[1:41:13] <%arkv01> literally three more things
[1:41:14] <BlackermanZX> oh god i forgot bout light man
[1:41:17] <%Zephyr1989> partyc10Rig TheIlluminati partyc10Rig
[1:41:18] <zzNamttamzz> Last gem in the movie theater
[1:41:18] <%crybirb> @SidJDuffy it's hard to moderate a discord man, it's always chaos, plus i doubt they were paid
[1:41:18] <Yomamma1337> all your saves are ng+ now
[1:41:19] <%Explodincatz> @Giothegame It never ends in Everhood.
[1:41:21] <ManfredA> the NG+ is just a bonus boss
[1:41:22] <HotSauceFiend> your save file is now a ng+ filw
[1:41:23] <+BigBruthaThunda> don't do that stupid shit it's not worth it
[1:41:23] <+TwitchGuy2021> @giothegame Yeah, it was awesome!
[1:41:23] <nyacoo> You don't have to, all saves are NG+
[1:41:24] <Ramasama13> i think the only 2 fights missed were the optional dev fight and the cat fight
[1:41:30] <%tank7013> @lion_kun Don't forget the one that heavily implied that suicide is good actually
[1:41:31] <Champstice> New Game+ retroactively applies to the other saves
[1:41:32] <%Indigo_Automaton> @Lion_kun That's not what it's saying. IRL your friends aren't trapped in a dimension of immortals that humanity invaded through technology
[1:41:33] <HotSauceFiend> all your files are now ng+
[1:41:33] <Visorak6> Dont need to
[1:41:43] <+BigBruthaThunda> hallway bs*
[1:41:54] <Pookiedaexzile> @Champstice Bump
[1:42:00] <+Jiggisnipe> wow
[1:42:03] <BlackermanZX> oh so you don't have to do all the game again?
[1:42:07] <OblivionSword1> huh
[1:42:07] <$tkuwari> custom battles?
[1:42:09] <ManfredA> yes
[1:42:14] <Pookiedaexzile> THEY WANT YOU TO NEVER LEAVE
[1:42:14] <Champstice> Hey load middle save btw
[1:42:14] <+Jiggisnipe> that's nice I think
[1:42:18] <Yomamma1337> replays and custom battles unlocked
[1:42:47] <$Rafraud> THE VIDEO GAME BUTTONS
[1:42:51] <HotSauceFiend> custom battles are hypw
[1:42:54] <BlackermanZX> so whats the middle ????
[1:42:56] <Tisaric> there's a sans battles that's hype af
[1:43:03] <+BigBruthaThunda> not on switch :(
[1:43:11] <Champstice> @Tisaric Made by one of the devs too, the madlad
[1:43:25] <$Rafraud> half of chat about to get real upset lol
[1:43:53] <Visorak6> Red is a fabrication to disassociate blame from Pink
[1:43:53] <HotSauceFiend> pink is the soul, red=human=mortal shell
[1:43:53] <velgaduere> Pink's reveal... affected nothing
[1:44:02] <ManfredA> Red was always Pink
[1:44:08] <ManfredA> they go over that a couple times
[1:44:12] <BlackermanZX> red was always pink i assume
[1:44:15] <Blank9> That feels lame
[1:44:21] <%Explodincatz> did u clap at Konami Code?
[1:44:22] <+Jiggisnipe> Red is a puppet so Pink was always there
[1:44:28] <+BigBruthaThunda> yeah kinda inconsequential huh
[1:44:30] <QueequegTheater> We really were the Everhood all along
[1:44:32] <+anoldtoilet> yeah its a rad game and it looks cool but idk if i like the writing from my exposure to it
[1:44:33] <Champstice> I *think* the point with Pink is that "hey y'know the Human we were talking about that kinda sucks? Yeah kinda meant Pink there not you lol"
[1:44:47] <ManfredA> no
[1:44:54] <ManfredA> Pink and the human are separate entitites
[1:44:58] <ManfredA> Pink even addresses you
[1:45:06] <HotSauceFiend> pink couldnt deal with her own wish to kill others, and created a puppet to do it for her... sorta?
[1:45:09] <Yomamma1337> I do think the pink 'twist' sucked, and felt like a twist for the sake of having a twist
[1:45:16] <%Indigo_Automaton> Something I think a lot of people missing with the claims that the game is endorsing murder and suicide is that all these Souls weren't supposed to be in the Everhood dimension to begin with. They aren't in the "Real" world, as in the modern times that appeared in the flashback. Everhood had to be destroyed because anyone that "dies" inside of it is trapped until the whole dimension is destroyed
[1:45:30] <@Menitta> I still didn't understand who or what pink was
[1:45:39] <+Jiggisnipe> Pink was another mage?
[1:45:48] <BlackermanZX> @Indigo_Automaton this is what i understand
[1:45:59] <OblivionSword1> memento mori
[1:46:00] <Tisaric> yeah that's basically it
[1:46:01] <+projectmanatees> yep woolie got it
[1:46:03] <HotSauceFiend> pink is just another character who realized that their existence as immortal beings was a problem
[1:46:04] <%crybirb> @Indigo_Automaton bro immortality above death unless the person chooses to, that's woolie point
[1:46:30] <%crybirb> pink wasn't even mentioned before the deus ex machina
[1:46:47] <ManfredA> they actually are referenced prior
[1:46:48] <gan_n_dorf> Have you heard the tale of Darth Pinkus the Mage? it's not a story the Jedi would tell you
[1:46:49] <Yomamma1337> @crybirb shes been in the game a bunch
[1:46:51] <%Lion_kun> The circumstances don't matter, you killed people against their consent.
[1:46:56] <Blank9> If you are immortal and not ending your life yourself then you are just living.
[1:46:56] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:47:08] <%Lion_kun> It doesn't matter if it was good afterwards.
[1:47:09] <%crybirb> @crybirb in the fights i saw them appearing but it was so random and the battles are random that i assumed it was whatever
[1:47:17] <+vaderxyz1970> here we go
[1:47:17] <ManfredA> there's prolly lore notes that they also missed
[1:47:25] <%Hapsam> I think the story is cool, but there are some real oofs in the game. As someone who had suicidal tendencies before some of parts of this game seem to urge you into suicide.
[1:47:35] <%SuckerPunchSyd> I think it would‚Äôve made more sense if like if you didnt have the arm that it was a pink outline or something
[1:47:37] <QueequegTheater> I can't wait for the "Woolie starts a death cult" memes
[1:47:38] <Furtive_Vulpine> i feel like all the intricacies and complexities of Everhood as a dimension and not actually being real just end up drudging the message
[1:47:38] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Like to hint at it earlier
[1:47:40] <%Eger007> i would recommend to read The Fable of the Dragon-Tyrant about death acceptance
[1:47:43] <+anoldtoilet> yeah
[1:47:47] <Pookiedaexzile> Genocide is cool tho
[1:47:47] <%Lion_kun> There is an easy way to fix this, make your protagonist the grim reaper.
[1:47:47] <+Jiggisnipe> yea
[1:47:47] <%baka_sugoi> We are promised two things in life
[1:47:55] <BlackermanZX> death in that dimension was not the real end of their life
[1:47:56] <velgaduere> ends do not justify means
[1:47:57] <+Jiggisnipe> I mean Rasta was pretty pissed
[1:48:01] <+anoldtoilet> and the game goes out of its way to say no, you need to be more right than them, and AFTER you kill them they'll thank you for it
[1:48:02] <+anoldtoilet> somehow
[1:48:04] <+projectmanatees> @Lion_kun they are
[1:48:04] <+anoldtoilet> lol
[1:48:05] <$Rafraud> most of them were mad about it lol
[1:48:05] <Blank9> Death isn‚Äôt supposed to be a ‚Äúgoal‚Äù
[1:48:14] <hewsped> yeah its pretty shakey justification
[1:48:16] <%crybirb> The message is confusing af and the entire "rules" of how everything works is messy and muddy. That's the main problem.
[1:48:16] <velgaduere> the means have to justify themselves
[1:48:16] <Furtive_Vulpine> how it reads is that it sort of WANTS you to die, rather than...addressing that fear of death
[1:48:20] <%Lion_kun> Make it obvious, make it a skeleton with a cape.
[1:48:23] <HotSauceFiend> thats why PINK created RED to begin with, because she couldnt handle the dillema
[1:48:26] <puluxor> Nah, you know better. Trust the voices in your head Kappa Kappa Kappa
[1:48:28] <+BigBruthaThunda> I know best, and u must die
[1:48:42] <$Rafraud> you HAVE to die by my hand
[1:48:44] <Pookiedaexzile> Does it ever happen on your own terms tho
[1:48:45] <+Jiggisnipe> like the Forest Spirit, they wanted to die
[1:48:50] <Furtive_Vulpine> youre sort of making these decisions for them
[1:48:54] <Yomamma1337> @Jiggisnipe not all of them, which is woolies problem
[1:48:55] <velgaduere> @HotSauceFiend yeah but the dilemma sucked as a plot device
[1:48:56] <leith_aziz> Alleviating their pain
[1:48:56] <QueequegTheater> @Pookiedaexzile Yes
[1:49:04] <%CaptainInvictus> I feel like the game doesn't do enough to explain why everyone needs to die in the everhood, or explain what the everhood is.  maybe there's something you can find that explains it more like that note in the desert temple, but without it it just makes the game's story incomplete and weird.
[1:49:05] <HR_Freud> silent hill 2 all over again
[1:49:07] <@Menitta> If the whole message hinges on how the rules of the universe, those rules need to be CRYSTAL clear if it's THIS message.
[1:49:15] <%cobalt_phoenix_> nah man, just kill your sick wife what could go wrong? Kappa
[1:49:20] <+Jiggisnipe> @Yomamma1337 I'm agreeing, using him as an example of sure kill him, but Rasta no
[1:49:24] <%hermitsen> hermitsen subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! 
[1:49:38] <%Indigo_Automaton> The game acknowledges that the killing was horrible, but it had to be done to free the other souls that were trapped in Everhood. Those souls ended their own lives on their terms, but they're unable to move on to reincarnation until Everhood and everything in it dies. The people choosing to stay immortal were denying peace to those that wanted to leave.
[1:49:41] <Furtive_Vulpine> silent hill 2 explores the consequences of making those decisions for his wife, yeah
[1:49:45] <QueequegTheater> James wants to die, but it's his choice
[1:49:47] <Tisaric> I think the thing that's messing it up a bit is the ones that don't WANT to die would still be fucking it up for the ones that did if they stayed alive
[1:49:48] <+Flarepulse> Silent Hood
[1:49:58] <Yomamma1337> @CaptainInvictus there are a bunch of notes in the game explaining how everyones stuck in everhood, and how a lot of people are either suffering or forgetting about their pain.
[1:49:58] <ordnavi> @cobalt_phoenix_ difference being your wife isn't immortal
[1:50:05] <+Fetrigon> @furtive_vulpine no matter how small the feeling, you will always fear death. it's about not letting that fear consume you.
[1:50:05] <ManfredA> I think people are missing the point where they were all living in hell and the people who were already dead were in super hell because they were the uboa monsters who noone can see
[1:50:07] <$Rafraud> CONSENT IS KEY CHAT
[1:50:08] <kaydvill> hi sorry if my English is Bad
[1:50:11] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @ordnavi yes i know
[1:50:15] <%X2Eliah> So, killin g everyone is OK if you dont feel guilty about it
[1:50:22] <+checkmate023> sounds like Aang's issue in ATLA against the Fire Lord
[1:50:24] <@Menitta> And then it also goes down to character writing and if that fails, it's even more of a problem
[1:50:29] <Tisaric> yeah it's more about they're living in hell and the ones that don't give consent are still keeping everyone else in hell
[1:50:30] <+BloodyBurney> the rule where everyone moves on or noone moves on feels arbitrary
[1:50:33] <Furtive_Vulpine> @Fetrigon it doesnt really come off that way, it just felt like putting the pillow on everyone
[1:50:38] <%CaptainInvictus> @CaptainInvictus that's what I'm saying, them being optional and missable is a mistake.
[1:50:41] <nyacoo> swedish morals
[1:50:49] <$Rafraud> yes, their situation is fucked up, but they need to VERBALLY ASK YOU TO KILL THEM
[1:51:02] <Furtive_Vulpine> "oh youre scared of death? no its fine let me show you"
[1:51:02] <+cubbywolf> do bad to do.good
[1:51:02] <+anoldtoilet> yeah lol
[1:51:03] <+Jiggisnipe> yea a lot of the context for the game can't be optional
[1:51:08] <+BigBruthaThunda> the rules of this universe were a stupid contrivance, so who cares if it makes sense in world
[1:51:09] <$Rafraud> Most of them resisted
[1:51:09] <+Fetrigon> @furtive_vulpine ay yeah for sure.
[1:51:11] <%Indigo_Automaton> @Rafraud And the souls that consented to death who were trapped in Everhood because of the other souls' choice to stay immortal should just stay trapped forever?
[1:51:21] <velgaduere> @BloodyBurney it is, but to be fair to the game, that's the central plot point that the game is based around. it's allowed to be arbitrary, because someone said "what if we make a game about this idea?"
[1:51:22] <%tank7013> Some of you are really going into "No you just don't get it though" mode but like, yea, we get it. It's just not great, or handled well
[1:51:23] <+anoldtoilet> having you literally force yourself onto people and then have an afterlife scene where they thank you for doing it is highly psycho
[1:51:23] <Furtive_Vulpine> @Fetrigon yeah, i get what you mean though dont worry
[1:51:25] <%Lion_kun> Just make your character a literal grim reaper, the concept of death incarnate, then there is no moral quandary.
[1:51:28] <+Jiggisnipe> the game needs to make the explanation of the Everhood and it's history nonskippable
[1:51:32] <+cubbywolf> nier autofroggo
[1:51:48] <zzNamttamzz> Eternity is an inconceivable amount of time
[1:52:11] <%CaptainInvictus> @anoldtoilet the game apparently explains everything but because it can be missed results in this fucked up sense of the whole thing.
[1:52:17] <%arkv01> yeah that part is fucked up
[1:52:18] <+anoldtoilet> @tank7013 yeah the themes are fine, the execution is very poor
[1:52:24] <%arkv01> "trust me, you need to die"
[1:52:27] <ordnavi> @lion_kun red was referred to as a god of death by bubblegum spirit I think
[1:52:30] <+cubbywolf> retroactive immortality LUL
[1:52:34] <+anoldtoilet> no i mean, even if its explained, like woolie is saying, this is a fundamentally wrong idea lol
[1:52:37] <+BigBruthaThunda> if the game was about leading people to their own conclusion, then that would be much better
[1:52:38] <%livlinn> NotLikeThis
[1:52:47] <Blank9> I just don‚Äôt like it much, shouldn‚Äôt have tried to make killing people morally correct.
[1:52:47] <Furtive_Vulpine> silent hill 2 did a much better job exploring that if we talk abt it, with james' guilt of killing maria and maria's repulsion to him for doing it
[1:52:54] <BlackermanZX> does woolie even remember that the uboa souls are stuck because everyone else want to live in the inmortal realm
[1:52:54] <Furtive_Vulpine> it showed the consequences of making those kind of choices
[1:53:00] <ManfredA> I think as I said, some games just aren't experienced well via streams, which is not a dig at Woolz at all
[1:53:04] <+anoldtoilet> like even in the context of this world, its really weird and unpleasant to play a character who needs to correctively murder people who dont want to be murdered
[1:53:05] <@Menitta> and then it also kinda does by going "there are no truths"
[1:53:15] <+BloodyBurney> maybe if the game opened with the "kill the world" twist it would have been handled better
[1:53:21] <+cubbywolf> killing can be moral... I think... maybe?
[1:53:35] <%baka_sugoi> NotLikeThis
[1:53:46] <%crybirb> @cubbywolf taking a life can never be moral.
[1:53:49] <+BigBruthaThunda> killing is moral if you arbitrarily create a world where it is
[1:53:52] <+capybruhArt> who knows, no absolute truths lol!  a friend
[1:54:01] <+vaporousTippler> Rem is disappointed in a lot of people today.
[1:54:01] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:54:02] <+anoldtoilet> its not that people are missing that it's explained in the lore, its that how its portrayed is very weird and like, borderline sociopathic
[1:54:02] <+cubbywolf> what about assisted death
[1:54:05] <%cobalt_phoenix_> chat, legit question, when was it said the people who die/are killed don't get to move on until everything else is gone mentioned? did we miss that or was i not paying attention
[1:54:05] <%Indigo_Automaton> Woolie, do you recall the Lost Souls(Gasters)? They are all trapped in Everhood until the Immortals and Everhood itself dies. Those that accepted death on their own terms are denied reincarnation because of the immortals and their selfish desire to live forever.
[1:54:11] <%CaptainInvictus> @anoldtoilet nah, if the setting of the game is in a dimension of immortality where those who die are trapped as lost souls until everyone dies, then the story makes sense. but since those explanations are missable, it leads to this fucked reading.
[1:54:13] <Tisaric> I think the issue is in the fact that you "kill" yeah - they probably could've found a better way to phrase it so it's not about consent in that way
[1:54:14] <+anoldtoilet> its still basically saying the player character is the only person with agency
[1:54:19] <$Rafraud> it's like they all got killed and retroactively found out it was "okay" but you still committed multiple murders WITHOUT that context
[1:54:26] <%arkv01> thats a cop out basically, because the post-death reconciliation feels infantile
[1:54:47] <%crybirb> @anoldtoilet so the lost souls are the ones who decide who dies next? that's just justifying samara being a bitch in USA.
[1:54:48] <HotSauceFiend> then you have people lkke harrowing hailey who begs you to kill her and then doubles back when it occurs. because thats an ordinary human reaction in face of death
[1:54:48] <%LastHazzerd> the withheld information would've helped understand your actions
[1:54:50] <+anoldtoilet> @arkv01 it really does. its the fakest and weirdest thing ive ever seen someone play through lol
[1:54:56] <%Indigo_Automaton> @cobalt_phoenix_ They tell you that they are trapped until the last star in Everhood dies
[1:54:58] <+BigBruthaThunda> lots of anime villains in chat
[1:55:04] <+vaderxyz1970> I feel that Wakfu did this the best with the villian that thought going to the past would fix no matter the consequences
[1:55:04] <Yomamma1337> @Rafraud you ha the context, but you didnt give them the context
[1:55:08] <Yomamma1337> @Rafraud had*
[1:55:08] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @cobalt_phoenix_ ah ok thanks, i missed that then
[1:55:19] <$Rafraud> that super does not make it better at all
[1:55:22] <%Hapsam> @Indigo_Automaton yeah but its also a selfish desire to kill everyone else because you are suffering
[1:55:22] <+Jiggisnipe> in the grand scheme, the Pink Red dichotomy doesn't matter
[1:55:22] <ordnavi> the story is weird and doesn't really work with irl morals
[1:55:32] <+anoldtoilet> its so corny and it shows that the devs knew how hard it is to swallow their message so they have literally every character in the game pat you on the back for doing something so naturally wrong
[1:55:33] <Pookiedaexzile> Pink was Puppeting red?
[1:55:33] <HotSauceFiend> we
[1:55:37] <%crybirb> "We are salty we died and cannot move on, all of you should die now"  naaah thats bs
[1:55:51] <leith_aziz> This is a really interesting discussion to listen to. You're good at being engaging, gotta say cohhNotes
[1:55:51] <QueequegTheater> While it's quite messy I think the game ended up pretty good overall
[1:55:53] <+Jiggisnipe> @Pookiedaexzile yea it seems
[1:55:57] <Furtive_Vulpine> i think in the world of Everhood, this works. but when you try and relate to the real world, without these intricate rules it sort of falls apart i think.
[1:56:03] <%baka_sugoi> oof
[1:56:07] <+BloodyBurney> im willing to overlook this plot because the game is fire otherwise, but damn lol
[1:56:09] <%jepupu> The most cruel deeds are done when you believe your path is righteous
[1:56:10] <ManfredA> Did Woolie find the note where Brown Mage talks about how they started falling into fucked up self-indulgence and hedonism, even doing horrible things to each other?
[1:56:15] <ManfredA> Like Professor Orange is right there
[1:56:22] <HotSauceFiend> the HUMAN is the puppeter and the puppet?
[1:56:24] <+cubbywolf> yes, murder for your Fuhrer
[1:56:28] <Tisaric> and again, this game was made by 2 pretty much first-time devs in 2 countries across the world from each other
[1:56:38] <+anoldtoilet> @anoldtoilet no, it doesnt make sense. lol. the idea of crafting this world where the only solution is to kill people who dont want to be killed is the problem.
[1:56:41] <+anoldtoilet> lmao yes woolie!!
[1:56:49] <Blank9> Was better with goofy characters, or at least go full cosmic level like killing the sun to cause a big bang and calling it there
[1:56:51] <%crybirb> @Tisaric And that's huge and very commendable. However it's not immune of criticism.
[1:56:52] <+JustToWatch> @Indigo_Automaton You can say the exact same thing in reverse though
[1:56:56] <+cubbywolf> you know what you have to do, laddie. BURN THEM ALL!
[1:57:02] <Blank9> Trying to justify your genocide route more is ???
[1:57:02] <+capybruhArt> the game is not bad bc of this, messy messaging is part of art. the fact that it encourages this level of discussion only adds to its value imo
[1:57:08] <+anoldtoilet> its literally the movie "Frailty" where theres a schizophrenic serial killer murdering people because he thinks their demons but the twist is he's right and they are demons and he should kill random moms with an axe
[1:57:09] <+BigBruthaThunda> is this why woolie watched that LUL
[1:57:10] <%LastHazzerd> The act of killing? was it?
[1:57:12] <QueequegTheater> kill em all, Peter
[1:57:13] <Furtive_Vulpine> oh yeah, Frailty
[1:57:17] <+anoldtoilet> they're
[1:57:24] <+cubbywolf> yeah but that person is insane
[1:57:26] <%baka_sugoi> NotLikeThis
[1:57:29] <+BloodyBurney> i think we should have seen the hedonism and self destruction, not read about it in a note and hear about after we kill them
[1:57:29] <%cobalt_phoenix_> uhhh
[1:57:31] <+nightmare6997> oh no
[1:57:33] <QueequegTheater> monkaS
[1:57:38] <HotSauceFiend> the citicism is completely valid and doesnt take away from the fact that the music and gamplay are exceptional
[1:57:41] <+Jiggisnipe> @BloodyBurney show don't tell
[1:57:44] <+cubbywolf> lots of people thought that way in the early history of humanity though
[1:57:45] <ManfredA> @BloodyBurney you literally do across the game
[1:57:47] <+Tevvy> the game's plot is clearly just trying to capitalize on undertale's success without having anything to say and not good at saying it. gameplay and music's sweet though
[1:57:55] <+anoldtoilet> art's good too
[1:57:56] <Furtive_Vulpine> i couldnt get that out of my mind when playing this game yeah. this game is good, but there are understandable gripes
[1:57:57] <%Indigo_Automaton> @Indigo_Automaton So the solution is to continue prolonging the suffering of the lost souls in favor of letting some people get their jollies for millions of years?
[1:58:01] <+anoldtoilet> i like everything about this game but the writing i think
[1:58:03] <+anoldtoilet> lol
[1:58:04] <+cubbywolf> Sacrafice them to the gods, even if they dont want to die they get to meet god!
[1:58:04] <Pookiedaexzile> American Funded Cold War Genocide with Happy Endings
[1:58:07] <Yomamma1337> @Tevvy if it was, then we wouldnt be talking about it right now.
[1:58:18] <+BloodyBurney> post-hoc is a good word here
[1:58:19] <+robertoszek> is the plot the Lost ending?
[1:58:25] <%CaptainInvictus> @anoldtoilet did you only join this stream or have you been following since the start
[1:58:34] <+cubbywolf> death means something individual to everyone too
[1:58:37] <QueequegTheater> Post-hoc justification does not make murder not murder
[1:58:51] <Furtive_Vulpine> i appreciate chat and woolie's serious discussion of this, it's good debate
[1:58:52] <Wixvhen> Ngl, I played this game on stream because you guys inspired me, and it was an amazing experience... And I had this moral quandary myself. It actually did upset me, but...
[1:58:56] <+anoldtoilet> @anoldtoilet i saw the first one and this one. and have read some of a wiki about this game
[1:58:59] <+cubbywolf> imagine murdering someone, meeting them in christian heaven and having them thank you
[1:59:05] <+vaderxyz1970> Discworld death best death
[1:59:05] <%crybirb> But yo nothing different from Alphys in Undertale, the one who did experiments and all and is forgiven in the end.
[1:59:06] <%X2Eliah> Distribue "C O M F O R T"
[1:59:06] <+Tevvy> @Tevvy if it was what? good? talking about something doesn't mean its good. lol
[1:59:12] <+Jiggisnipe> Pink shouldn't have been a mage, they should just have been the incarnation of death with no connection to the characters
[1:59:13] <+Fetrigon> Woolie we can't fast forward in real life. I think that's the parallel the devs are going for.
[1:59:17] <Pookiedaexzile> Woolie Versus
[1:59:23] <nyacoo> Task failed successfully
[1:59:24] <@Menitta> Reminds me of the ending of Beyond Two Souls more than anything else tbh
[1:59:25] <HotSauceFiend> but they would never die and trap an infinjte amount of souls in perpetual agony
[1:59:30] <+cubbywolf> LUL
[1:59:33] <+cubbywolf> dance for death
[1:59:33] <+hopefulupr659> pat sure has changed
[1:59:36] <+Flarepulse> Woolie's Absolute Truth
[1:59:37] <+anoldtoilet> but again, you're not understanding that the lore creating the situation where this is good in the story, doesnt mean its a good story or that the message is good irl
[1:59:39] <+JustToWatch> @crybirb Alphys didn't kill anyone though
[1:59:41] <ManfredA> I wonder if people would be able to accept the idea more if it was translated to the virtual equivalent, where kill is "forcefully log out" and it's just a virtual hell
[1:59:42] <GHouseduivel> @Menitta David Cage was inside us all along?
[2:00:03] <Pookiedaexzile> Fighting Death is our Living Nature
[2:00:10] <%X2Eliah> yeah thats how the terrorist recruiters get you, hiding the message with banger sountracks
[2:00:10] <%crybirb> @crybirb Oh yeah just a Mengele around the entire game. Nothing wrong with that.
[2:00:11] <BlackermanZX> but if you refuse to do it then the lost souls are suffering eternally
[2:00:13] <GHouseduivel> Having to pull the plug on grandma or mom :/
[2:00:15] <+cubbywolf> pat just changed his melanin
[2:00:25] <+cubbywolf> its easier to kill grandma than mom
[2:00:35] <%LastHazzerd> @blackermanzx the game needed to make it much more clear early on
[2:00:41] <Wixvhen> I think what Woolie is feeling is THE EXACT INTENTION of this game. It feels wrong.
[2:00:43] <%Hapsam> The ghosts cant die too because of the others trying to not die. Boths sides take over the decision for the other.
[2:00:48] <Wixvhen> And it's intended to feel wrong.
[2:00:52] <+BigBruthaThunda> sometimes I sneak into hospitals and kill all the cancer patients cuz I'm based and red pilled
[2:00:53] <+Fetrigon> We can't know the ultimate consequences of our most important life decisions.
[2:00:57] <+cubbywolf> I don't know if 99% of individuals get a choice to decide their time
[2:01:07] <+anoldtoilet> yeah. i had to watch my mom die of cancer and her life in the end was objectively bad and nothing but suffering. it would not be the right thing to do to kill her if she didnt ask for it.
[2:01:08] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1490976552661979140?t=ZdiSmYj01DtZhJb8xco6Ig&s=19
[2:01:19] <+cubbywolf> cancer sucks ass
[2:01:24] <+Kyma1020> The only time I can think of is if they're in a terminal coma or late stage dementia
[2:01:24] <BlackermanZX> but the inmortals are being selfish too because they are deciding to live in that dimension and deying reincarnation to the lost souls
[2:01:26] <%crybirb> @anoldtoilet I'm sorry you had to go through that
[2:01:27] <QueequegTheater> @crybirb Alphys made fucked up mistakes, she wasn't intentionally causing suffering, she was trying to save dying monsters
[2:01:38] <+BloodyBurney> put another way, the writers make a story where murder is okay to communicate the idea that death is inevitable and you should accept it, and they could have not done that
[2:01:41] <CrimsonGargoyle> @anoldtoilet i'm sorry bro <3
[2:01:50] <+anoldtoilet> ty chat
[2:01:59] <%crybirb> @crybirb Her acts being a monster were never addressed and she did a HUGE harm in the story. It's a huge plothole IMO.
[2:02:00] <%LastHazzerd> she didn't choose
[2:02:02] <ManfredA> That's actually an interesting thought because there are people who ask to die who aren't allowed to by other people who steal their agency from them
[2:02:07] <ManfredA> both in real life and the game
[2:02:12] <+anoldtoilet> @crybirb üáΩ
[2:02:17] <ManfredA> it's a hard moral quandary
[2:02:17] <velgaduere> "the fuck do you MEAN "no"???"
[2:02:18] <Wixvhen> To be fair, it's suggested that Pink/Red are split personalities.
[2:02:26] <%Indigo_Automaton> If I decide that I want to die and I'm not allowed to pass on because some asshole wants to live forever I would want the universe to end to
[2:02:28] <GHouseduivel> @crybirb Not a pothole if she is a psychopathic murderer
[2:02:35] <%LastHazzerd> she actively put her task on Red cuz she didn't want to be the one to do it
[2:02:46] <+cubbywolf> Frog seems like he wants both and doesnt want both
[2:02:48] <%arkv01> you get the exclusive burden of murdering everyone as they scream no
[2:02:54] <%crybirb> @GHouseduivel Agree, but she is only portrayed or talked about as a Quirky Nerdy and that's just out of place.
[2:02:58] <jimgimp> They touch on this pretty early on in Jujutsu Kaisen
[2:03:02] <+Fetrigon> @Indigo_Automaton true LUL
[2:03:04] <+cubbywolf> LUL
[2:03:08] <+anoldtoilet> @crybirb yeah its part of what ultimately really rubs me the wrong way about undertale. alphys is pretty evil as far as im concerned and its like humanizing a dr mengele figure
[2:03:17] <Wixvhen> The emotional journey is PURPOSELY fucked to be messed up.
[2:03:17] <jimgimp> {Havent finished 1st season btw}
[2:03:20] <QueequegTheater> @crybirb nah
[2:03:20] <velgaduere> @Wixvhen is it? because I'm pretty sure the game says Red was just a proxy that Pink used because Pink couldn't handle others knowing it was them who wanted to kill everyone
[2:03:23] <ManfredA> Pink's real dilemma is that they are essentially the only gun in the world but they don't want to be
[2:03:31] <ManfredA> they're not someone who wanted to kill everyone
[2:03:38] <%crybirb> @crybirb Exactly, she is just a Mengele and people are talking about like shes Quirky and cute, but she did HORRIBLE things.
[2:03:38] <ManfredA> they were the only one who CAN kill everyone
[2:03:43] <+cubbywolf> it seemed like everyone had to be saved or no one would be
[2:03:44] <%Explodincatz> the games message was so poorly told we can make up our own message instead
[2:03:46] <Champstice> @crybirb Nah but that's different cuz Toby Fox wrote that
[2:03:52] <%tank7013> The thing that really makes this fucked is the room full of your victims going "no what you did was morally good actually thank you for genocide". I feel like removing that alone could mostly fix this
[2:04:05] <+anoldtoilet> definitely
[2:04:08] <+Jiggisnipe> @WoolieVersus apparently, it has to be all or none cuz the dead don't truly die unless everyone dies
[2:04:11] <%LastHazzerd> they are the grim reaper in a world that's artificially extended its life to infinity, and they don't want to be
[2:04:12] <Blank9> Just stop the end after the sun boss
[2:04:16] <Triplicat> props to woolie expressing his full-formed and reasoned opinion without comparing it to undertale in any way
[2:04:17] <velgaduere> @ManfredA I don't think that's true. I think anyone in Everhood was able to, but nobody wanted to. Pink knew what was right and had trouble doing it, and thus the puppet proxy
[2:04:22] <+cubbywolf> why woolie WHYYYY
[2:04:28] <nolifegamin> @Explodincatz tbh I prefer interpreting my own message from a game anyways instead of being spoon-fed one
[2:04:32] <+cubbywolf> time to grab a rock
[2:04:33] <Pookiedaexzile> We can save that Pupper
[2:04:38] <+Fetrigon> I really think not being able to see the future consequences is part pf the point.
[2:04:46] <Pookiedaexzile> Give him little wheels
[2:04:51] <+cubbywolf> what life will that deer have afterwards
[2:04:54] <%Indigo_Automaton> That is what's happening though, except extended to millions of years
[2:04:59] <%LastHazzerd> the game did not establish well that everyone was suffering, as woolie exolains
[2:05:00] <%Lion_kun> Just make the protagonist the literal grim reaper, then there is no argument to be made, it's like well that's death, can't argue morality with that.
[2:05:04] <GHouseduivel> People.
[2:05:06] <QueequegTheater> @crybirb I seriously disagree with the comparisons to Mengele.  Alphys caused a lot of suffering but she was only ever trying to save monsters who were dying. Mengele was a psychopath who played with bodies because it got his dick hard
[2:05:07] <ManfredA> @velgaduere They explicitly say that Pink is the only one who can actually end things because while people choose to die, it's only a fake death that leaves them as an even worse fate
[2:05:13] <+cubbywolf> the immortality part makes it more... religious to me
[2:05:17] <slackerunchained> Mary is SUFFERING, James... Take the pillow and END IT!
[2:05:24] <$Rafraud> Pat wants to be a toilet
[2:05:28] <%Lion_kun> Disc world books handled these themes waaaay better.
[2:05:28] <+cubbywolf> I can turn into a giant goo monsters its great
[2:05:43] <%Indigo_Automaton> @Lion_kun They basically are. Everhood's God itself endorses what you're doing.
[2:05:44] <+cubbywolf> Pat doesnt want to be a toilet, he'd just rather be a toilet than human
[2:05:44] <+Jiggisnipe> isn't being Hollow awesome?
[2:05:46] <velgaduere> @ManfredA choose for *themselves* to die, but cannot due to the nature of Everhood. I really don't think the game ever explicitly said "no one else can kill the others"
[2:05:51] <zzNamttamzz> LUL
[2:05:53] <QueequegTheater> And other people end up like Siegmeyer or Lucatiel FeelsBadMan
[2:05:56] <Blank9> Oh noooo some of them are bored better kill them all
[2:05:57] <nolifegamin> and the great thing about Dark Souls is that it doesn't railroad you into its message, a lot is left to player interpretation
[2:06:00] <%Explodincatz> @Explodincatz u make your own truths then
[2:06:00] <%Lion_kun> Also Death in Discworld kicked ass
[2:06:01] <Wixvhen> @velgaduere Orange put them in that puppet to contain their erratic power/nature.
[2:06:05] <+cubbywolf> the G O O
[2:06:08] <slackerunchained> @velgaduere "I cannot self-terminate."
[2:06:09] <%crybirb> @crybirb There were Nazi doctors who were trying to cure cancer and other diseases. Does that make them right? Read about the Nazi Doctor trials and you see a lot of "well motivated" or lets use Undertale choice of word "Determined" doctors that don't feel like they are the bad guys at all.
[2:06:11] <jimgimp> Way more cut and dry in stuff like Mad Max and its successors
[2:06:11] <%Hapsam> i think the suffering of the ghosts should have been more emphasized. There are a lot of parts in the story that could have been improven
[2:06:12] <+Toblo1> @crybirb Not to mention that taking care of (and keeping secret) the Amalgamates seriously had some mental/emotional trauma to it. To say nothing about what possibly happens to her in the Neutral Endings.
[2:06:16] <@Menitta> We live in a society
[2:06:16] <+Flarepulse> much has been said
[2:06:17] <ordnavi> any hollowers in chat :O
[2:06:21] <+BigBruthaThunda> in sum, writing a story is hard
[2:06:22] <HotSauceFiend> I think if you were shown and told that souls werent able to reincarnate or die because the mages and other characters were blocking that ability without realizing it would have dramatically changed the perception of the situatio here
[2:06:23] <velgaduere> @slackerunchained again, not talking about suicide. talking about homocide
[2:06:25] <jimgimp> Bad man stop human reopopulate , bad man die
[2:06:30] <+anoldtoilet> @velgaduere there should be a route where you convince them to accept the end then, not just murder them out of the blue and then they tell you wow. you were so brave to do that. at the end
[2:06:33] <+cubbywolf> all I remember from this LP is when woolie told reggie their Link went down
[2:06:37] <%LastHazzerd> they asked you to tell them how you felt at the end
[2:06:47] <%baka_sugoi> What ending did woolie get?
[2:06:50] <BlackermanZX> Columbo never ends
[2:06:52] <%crybirb> @crybirb Exatly, the only thing she does to redeem herself is portray herself as a victim and say "HEY NOW I HAVE SELF ESTEEM I BELIEVE IN MYSELF". It's bs and badly written.
[2:06:52] <velgaduere> @anoldtoilet maybe so
[2:06:54] <Champstice> @LastHazzerd Yeah like..... Literally
[2:06:58] <Triplicat> time to send a link to the VOD LuvPeekL
[2:07:16] <QueequegTheater> @crybirb Alphys isn't espousing a fascist supremacy movement and using monsters as test subjects because they're beneath her.
[2:07:40] <+anoldtoilet> ok but the last part she kind of is doing.
[2:07:40] <%LastHazzerd> asking the player to email them means this was very much a social experiment to some extent.
[2:07:40] <ManfredA> @velgaduere They do but I won't belabor it out.
[2:07:43] <DSD24> Refund the game NOW!
[2:07:52] <+BigBruthaThunda> Switch does not allow refunds. i tried
[2:08:07] <dg4ii> @LastHazzerd or they could just want feedback on the game that they made
[2:08:07] <%Prevot> I REALLY hate that "just stop playing" shit that always comes up with Spec Ops
[2:08:12] <+anoldtoilet> lol yeah
[2:08:12] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:08:15] <%crybirb> @crybirb She actually is, she is into killing the kids and all that stuff, she is into everything that goes on and only later she stops but still no demonstration of growth other than her self esteem.
[2:08:17] <nolifegamin> I think Everhood has a very compelling idea for its story, but maybe they should work with a writer next time on presenting said story better
[2:08:24] <velgaduere> @ManfredA maybe I missed it or they missed it then, because I've heard that's very possible in this game (which is another thing I have issues with)
[2:08:27] <+maria_luke> Woolie, Pink didn't want everyone dead. Pink heard of her task and created Red who tried once and backed out, literally ripping himself apart to protect his friends.
[2:08:42] <+cubbywolf> SKULLS FOR THE SKULL THRONE
[2:08:43] <ManfredA> That's why I say that it's not a good stream game
[2:08:45] <%arkv01> okay! Onto uhh
[2:08:48] <+sewermonk> "murder is ok" -everhood
[2:08:49] <%crybirb> Is pink a he, she or they?
[2:08:54] <%LastHazzerd> @dg4ii they asked for how the game made us FEEL. not what we thought about the game.
[2:08:58] <+maria_luke> they
[2:08:58] <Wixvhen> Let's go with They.
[2:09:01] <+cubbywolf> I think pink is a she but it seems more like a they
[2:09:04] <$Rafraud> If anything the game promotes discussion, if not for the right reasons lol
[2:09:04] <Pookiedaexzile> Pink is Cheeked up

[2:09:07] <ordnavi> their all theys
[2:09:08] <QueequegTheater> @crybirb What the fuck are you even talking about? She used the human souls that Asgore already killed to try and save monsters, she wasn't fucking kidnapping children
[2:09:09] <velgaduere> everybody, go write your last wills and testaments RIGHT NOW
[2:09:14] <dg4ii> @LastHazzerd how the fuck else would you phrase that question
[2:09:16] <+gitgouda> do like kramer and what now?
[2:09:16] <+projectmanatees> sajamGuapo chat needs to calm down you're all being dumb with your discussions going in circles
[2:09:16] <GHouseduivel> Naw just push me into a meat grinder.
[2:09:22] <+Toblo1> @crybirb Aaaaaand you lost me with that.
[2:09:25] <%crybirb> @crybirb She was still onboard knowing what was happening.
[2:09:25] <+capybruhArt> dumpy, any pronouns
[2:09:28] <@Menitta> "I didn't know it was possible to come out of a coma!"
[2:09:28] <leith_aziz> This was an engaging conversation. Thanks for the TED talk Clap
[2:09:29] <+JustToWatch> @crybirb Who did Alphys actually kill? Don't seem to remember that part
[2:09:35] <GHouseduivel> Serve me at a Ikea
[2:09:37] <Shwepie> Woolie went into a thousand yard stare for a moment.
[2:09:52] <Wixvhen> I'd love if there was an Everhood creator in here going 'Yeeees, this is what I wanted to hear!'
[2:09:53] <%crybirb> @crybirb No one, but she was with Asgore on the killing of the kids.
[2:09:54] <+anoldtoilet> @crybirb she was just screwing around to see what would happen, has zero expressed guilt, and im pretty sure she was in fact kidnapping kids
[2:09:54] <Champstice> Ah yes, the SOuls games, another series made by 2 People, right
[2:09:54] <+Toblo1> @crybirb I have no idea where @crybirb is going with this.
[2:10:05] <%Indigo_Automaton> The souls being trapped in Everhood for eternity because of the immortal's selfish desire to live for millions of years longer than ANY lifeform would ever naturally live to is enough justification for me.
[2:10:09] <+cubbywolf> as Kenny from South Park said. "If I'm ever in a vegetative state... please... dont ever show me in that condition on national TV."
[2:10:11] <slackerunchained> It's a *good* message at heart...  Just told a little amateurishly, I think.
[2:10:14] <linSP> Is this game as good as undertale?
[2:10:19] <kes009900> i had an accident as a kid, where i was almost killed by someone. nowadays, i dont worry too much about death, as it is something i cant control, and can happen at any time.
[2:10:28] <Futurecity10> Just play the Gandalf speech from Return of the King
[2:10:28] <dg4ii> @linSP no, but it's interesting
[2:10:36] <kenny_biff> I just came into the stream but apparently rhythm rpg gets philosophical
[2:10:36] <QueequegTheater> @crybirb @anoldtoilet Source: I made it up
[2:10:43] <+cubbywolf> get on those elven ships and sail into the afterworld
[2:10:47] <+za7az> @kenny_biff You have no idea LUL
[2:10:48] <%crybirb> @crybirb @Tobl1 she did experiments, she knew about the kids that fell and Asgore "dealt" with them. She didn't show any growth about her deeds, there was no redemption other than her "self-esteem"
[2:10:48] <Wixvhen> @Indigo_Automaton It should be mentioned that the 'Hallway Ending' suggests it's much much more than millions.
[2:10:51] <HotSauceFiend> @indigo_automaton unfortunately that isnt CLEARLY conveyed in the game hence confusion and moral quandries
[2:10:52] <Pookiedaexzile> Give the Grim reaper What For
[2:10:56] <%crybirb> @crybirb @QueequegTheater keklul
[2:11:04] <+vaporousTippler> Rage against death, but give the Reaper a GG when you lose.
[2:11:07] <+JustToWatch> @crybirb Was she? Pretty sure trying to find away to break the barrier without using the humans souls is in contradiction with that
[2:11:09] <dg4ii> undertale is almost perfect, Everhood is very flawed. But they're both worthwhile and interesting experiences
[2:11:24] <+anoldtoilet> @crybirb yes its a very narcissistic character who explicitly does evil and has no opinion on the evil she does, but she doesnt kill people with a knife so shes good
[2:11:25] <+cubbywolf> God is murdering me RIGHT NOW
[2:11:34] <BlackermanZX> the game definitely should have explained the lost souls stuff better
[2:11:38] <AsheStariel> I think one of this games biggest issues was everyone comparing it to Undertale when in reality they are so different in every aspect other than they are both pixel based indie games.
[2:11:43] <Teradyne87> We're all made up of matter billions of years old, "who" we are is fleeting, but what we are is eternal
[2:11:48] <leith_aziz> "Make the most of your time left" sticks with me cohhL
[2:11:50] <+capybruhArt> everhood's gonna be a fuckin rad cultural artifact in a few years bc of all its stumbles and inspirations
[2:11:52] <%Demahu8029> Then maybe you being death incarnate isn't about the suffering or giving mercy but the inability to accept that not only striving for immortality is against natural order
[2:11:55] <%crybirb> @crybirb @JustToWatch Gonna be honest my memory is foggy due to being so much time I was into Undertale, but I remember she was using the souls together with the monsters, which resulted in Flowye, wasn't that?
[2:11:57] <+Jiggisnipe> Gold Pig loved the material world
[2:12:00] <%baka_sugoi> mushroom forest
[2:12:06] <%Hapsam> i hope reggie brings up the ghosts too
[2:12:06] <+Jiggisnipe> Green Mage was going insane
[2:12:12] <+Jiggisnipe> Disco Jimmy was ????
[2:12:16] <Champstice> @capybruhArt At least it didn't stumble anywhere NEAR as hard as YIIK
[2:12:23] <+anoldtoilet> lol yiik is VERY bad
[2:12:33] <+robertoszek> yiikes
[2:12:34] <+anoldtoilet> this game is good but doesnt stick the landing imo
[2:12:42] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @Indigo_Automaton game coulda went more into that, then it would be easier to justify
[2:12:46] <+capybruhArt> i only know yiik for its stumbles, which is an accomplishment as an artifact lol
[2:12:46] <QueequegTheater> @crybirb She created Flowey on accident, she was trying to use the SOULs to save dying monsters
[2:12:46] <BlackermanZX> fuck you orange
[2:12:47] <%crybirb> This game is really good and well maid, YIIK is a disaster
[2:12:47] <+BigBruthaThunda> do it, Anakin
[2:12:49] <+Toblo1> @capybruhArt TBH you have to *REALLY* be trying to be as bad as YIIK.
[2:12:49] <+Fetrigon> Yiik?!!!! OMEGALUL OMEGALUL OMEGALUL OMEGALUL OMEGALUL
[2:12:57] <ordnavi> disco jimmy just kept changing themself constantly
[2:13:00] <+Toblo1> I'd still put this way over Yiik. by a fucking country mile.
[2:13:02] <Pookiedaexzile> Somebody aint coming back a Brahman
[2:13:11] <QueequegTheater> @crybirb Her creating Flowey is what caused her to freak out and stop using the SOULs
[2:13:24] <AsheStariel> This game wasnt meant to get as much attention as it did. It just has some good music and got way more popular then intended.
[2:13:28] <%crybirb> @crybirb @QueequegTheater so she knew it were humans sousl and she was experimenting on them right?
[2:13:31] <Champstice> @anoldtoilet Yeah the landing is Eh, but I'll take it being p solid for the most part
[2:13:33] <ManfredA> I don't think it's the most skillful demonstration of its merits, but I played it myself last year and I think it had a lot of interesting points
[2:13:35] <Pookiedaexzile> Member the Caste System
[2:13:43] <+anoldtoilet> @crybirb and then she kept doing it, for basically no reason, and its fine. she loves anime uwu
[2:13:57] <Teradyne87> When I'm dead I want to be put in the earth and have a tree sapling planted on my grave
[2:14:08] <QueequegTheater> @crybirb That's not the gotcha you think it is. We use dead fetus stem cells for medical research IRL
[2:14:09] <%crybirb> @crybirb @anoldtoilet hey, don't say that, I'm making these things up!  But yeah that's my point.
[2:14:16] <@Menitta> There is something to be said about it managing to spark this kind of discussion And the value in that
[2:14:19] <+BigBruthaThunda> it said orange made red
[2:14:21] <%Indigo_Automaton> @Indigo_Automaton I agree, the story could have communicated some things more clearly. But then again I played through and missed those Resist lore bits and still got what the story was trying to tell me. I wonder if some context also got lost in translation
[2:14:29] <velgaduere> "you know not what you do"
[2:14:30] <%crybirb> @crybirb @QueequegTheater that's a very weird comparition you just made.
[2:14:59] <QueequegTheater> @crybirb How is it any different
[2:15:08] <%Indigo_Automaton> It was disassociation, yeah
[2:15:09] <BlackermanZX> pink was trying to shift the burden to a puppet
[2:15:19] <+anoldtoilet> @crybirb yeah its like. the point is she only stops when she creates something that endangers herself. creating monsters who live lives of suffering doesnt matter and she doesnt feel bad about it. kidnapping monsters and experimenting on them without their consent doesnt bother her.
[2:15:19] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:15:21] <ManfredA> Red speaks to you in the mirror
[2:15:26] <morow1ec> it's the gun that killed them not me
[2:15:32] <ManfredA> they are a separate entity
[2:15:35] <%crybirb> @crybirb Please don't put Undertale Alphys being a monster together with real life super serious stuff. These steem cells don't come from kids that were killed by a furry king.
[2:15:38] <+projectmanatees> the main issue is that for people to leave they all need to leave so if at least one person stays no one can leave still fucked but i get your points
[2:15:40] <$Rafraud> Good discussion
[2:15:55] <Pookiedaexzile> From my Point of View it is the Buddah that is evil
[2:16:02] <%livlinn> GT kyoryuLove
[2:16:10] <+Fetrigon> I'm really glad we all agreed woolie is wrong once again :)
[2:16:17] <leith_aziz> ngl, this discussion is kinda amazing in terms of topics explored
[2:16:17] <%crybirb> @crybirb @QueequegTheater I understand that you are trying to make a point but this is going too far, I'm not going this deep to go against or pro a furry Homestuck rip off
[2:16:21] <+anoldtoilet> no woolie is right
[2:16:26] <+BigBruthaThunda> lol
[2:16:26] <QueequegTheater> @crybirb There is a significant contingent of the population that believes that they come from murdered children. I'm not one of them, but the comparison is there.
[2:16:29] <%Lion_kun> WHAT AMBIGUITY
[2:16:30] <+Toblo1> @crybirb Says the user who compared her to Joseph fucking Mengle
[2:16:31] <+capybruhArt> @projectmanatees chewing gum in class-ass universal morality system
[2:16:42] <Pookiedaexzile> Murder is "Morally ambiguous"
[2:16:42] <%crybirb> @crybirb @QueequegTheater hey, just, no, let's stop.
[2:16:45] <+BigBruthaThunda> it's ambiguous Kappa
[2:16:48] <%Lion_kun> Game literally gave you a hand job for killing everyone
[2:16:53] <%Eger007> the bear
[2:16:57] <ManfredA> You don't get to invoke Mengele and then try to deescalate
[2:16:59] <AnneSQF> white bear?
[2:17:02] <QueequegTheater> @crybirb "Nazi comparisons are fine but if it's something that's real suddenly I get uncomfortable"
[2:17:02] <ManfredA> that's just dishonest
[2:17:08] <@Menitta> @crybirb @queequegtheater let's end it there.
[2:17:13] <BlackermanZX> i feel some people are disregarding the elephant in the room that is the trapped lost souls
[2:17:13] <GHouseduivel> I lost the first 20 years of my life after a house fire, having to learn about life from the first 20 years was rough
[2:17:13] <+anoldtoilet> i invoked mengele not him. and i stand by it
[2:17:17] <linSP> How many hot characters did the game have for it to be morally grey?
[2:17:18] <%tank7013> The game ham fists moral righteousness they go out of their way to write out ambiguity
[2:17:21] <QueequegTheater> @crybirb I was just as uncomfortable with the Mengele comparison as you are right now
[2:17:28] <%LastHazzerd> talk not over yet, folk donated money with the topic in mind, so the talk will continue
[2:17:31] <%crybirb> @crybirb I agree with you there, I went deeper than I should've. It's just undertale. @Menitta Agree with you.
[2:17:35] <$Rafraud> SHUT UP
[2:17:37] <$Rafraud> NOT DONE
[2:17:39] <$Rafraud> PLEASE
[2:17:41] <+anoldtoilet> he who every character defined by unethical medical experiments that torture people get compared to. her character evokes that evil.
[2:17:42] <QueequegTheater> @Menitta Alright
[2:17:47] <Yomamma1337> are we bringing up aots ending lol
[2:17:47] <$Rafraud> Okay saved lol
[2:17:57] <%Lion_kun> Hahahaha
[2:17:59] <%CaptainInvictus> good ol' attack on titan, faceplanting at the finish line
[2:18:06] <AnneSQF> Imma kill you for your own good
[2:18:12] <%livlinn> joofbSweat joofbSweat joofbSweat
[2:18:13] <Pookiedaexzile> Attack on Nationalism
[2:18:13] <%Lion_kun> Thank you Eren
[2:18:14] <+JustToWatch> Right, we didn't even consider that pink has a great ass, that makes this whole thing morally gray
[2:18:15] <@Moobot> Please don't fill up the entire chat, @agumon9000
[2:18:18] <+BigBruthaThunda> I do :)
[2:18:26] <zanzibarian_hamster> It is actually illegal to murder people
[2:18:27] <%crybirb> @anoldtoilet Undertale is a really hard thing to criticize as people get way too emotinal. Let's just stop and let people enjoy bad fanfics.
[2:18:27] <+anoldtoilet> @JustToWatch lmao. true. hot cant be evil!
[2:18:30] <Pookiedaexzile> Attack on "We sided with the Nazis"
[2:18:33] <GHouseduivel> @CaptainInvictus Do you really think there is a good outcome for that story?
[2:19:07] <%CaptainInvictus> @CaptainInvictus I'm not going to discuss the ending of attack on titan, except that it was incredibly well done right up until the final goddamn chapter lol
[2:19:22] <QueequegTheater> @CaptainInvictus I mean, you could just cut to a black screen with "FIN" before the faceplant and it would be a better ending
[2:19:22] <ManfredA> I again broach the topic of people possibly reexamining it if the world was virtual and kill was replaced with forcefully log off
[2:19:29] <$hattrick61> isnt that Red talking to pink
[2:19:32] <%CaptainInvictus> @CaptainInvictus truth
[2:19:41] <ordnavi> it's pink talking to red
[2:19:50] <%Lion_kun> No the penultimate chapter sucked too lol
[2:20:03] <Teradyne87> The important thing about believing in conscious existence after death is to not let it devalue life
[2:20:03] <%LastHazzerd> the game didn't ciment that everyone is stuck
[2:20:05] <%Indigo_Automaton> Yeah the Lost Souls stated they were trapped in Everhood and denied Reincarnation
[2:20:08] <Atomic_Blowfish> @zanzibarian_hamster source?
[2:20:11] <Rifleavenger> Finishing "I'm gonna kill everyone and then myself... they'll thank me" the game?
[2:20:19] <zanzibarian_hamster> @Atomic_Blowfish Dude trust me
[2:20:21] <+agumon9000> @WoolieVersus The idea is basically pink is a coward, wanting to kill but can't do it himself. So he made the doll to blame it all on when in reality its all pink. Since remember when you first start controlling pink you can't move him until he has the blindfold.
[2:20:24] <%Lion_kun> I heard the anime is changing the ending and the manga author asked fans to treat the anime as the definitive ending lol
[2:20:26] <%Indigo_Automaton> All the immortals and Everhood itself has to die to free the Lost Souls
[2:20:32] <Blank9> No one‚Äôs entitled to reincarnate NOW, they have eternity to do it later
[2:20:33] <+Flarepulse> the souls came back willingly after seeing their friends, still alive and suffering
[2:20:42] <%CaptainInvictus> @WoolieVersus I think the game not explaining the rules of the Everhood world up front, and allowing critical lore dumps like the note in the desert temple to be missible, is a huge flaw of the game
[2:20:42] <velgaduere> @zanzibarian_hamster checks out SeemsGood
[2:20:43] <+kewlmyc> @Lion_kun So we're just making shit up now
[2:20:44] <+JustToWatch> @Lion_kun wait really? lmao
[2:20:55] <QueequegTheater> If you kill everyone who would put you in jail, did you really commit a crime
[2:20:56] <%AlteisenReiseZ> TIME FOR L O V E
[2:20:59] <%Hapsam> the BIG one PogCHamp
[2:21:05] <leith_aziz> pickyFocus
[2:21:05] <%Lion_kun> Thats whatbI read on twitter, could be fake I dunno
[2:21:17] <Champstice> Custom Battles! Custom Battles!
[2:21:18] <BlackermanZX> what is the ???? file
[2:21:23] <+kewlmyc> "Read on Twitter" is a step above "read on 4chan"
[2:21:25] <QueequegTheater> @Lion_kun Sounds like weapons-grade copium
[2:21:28] <ManfredA> that is the game developer's dilemma
[2:21:37] <+JustToWatch> @Lion_kun ok that's probably not a great confirmation
[2:21:38] <@Menitta> @kewlmyc not even above.
[2:21:48] <@Menitta> LUL
[2:21:52] <ManfredA> either make lore missable and thus people complain and get confused, or you make it mandatory reading and people complain about handholding or forcefeeding
[2:21:55] <leith_aziz> Anyway, this was an interesting topic. I wouldnt mind more of this, but that's probably what CSB is for cohhHmm
[2:21:58] <%Lion_kun> I mean it would be hilarious if it were true
[2:22:05] <velgaduere> @Lion_kun why even mention it if there's no definitive source? lmao
[2:22:07] <Champstice> Nowhere!
[2:22:07] <%Hapsam> i might be mistaken, but they might not need to fight the light guy
[2:22:08] <+kewlmyc> @Menitta Lol, true, fair enough
[2:22:10] <velgaduere> lmfao nice
[2:22:11] <leith_aziz> D:
[2:22:13] <Daxalog> fair
[2:22:13] <+KisukeOboro> LOL okay then
[2:22:13] <+JustToWatch> lol
[2:22:13] <%CaptainInvictus> GOT IT.
[2:22:15] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> crunchy
[2:22:16] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> alright then lol

[2:22:17] <%itstreylar> bitrate died for 3 seconds lmao
[2:22:20] <+JustToWatch> FAIR ENOUGH
[2:22:20] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:22:20] <+ReallyBigRocks> bitrate demolisher
[2:22:21] <AppleBerryKitty> WELL OK!
[2:22:22] <@Menitta> I see.
[2:22:26] <BlackermanZX> LUL
[2:22:27] <leith_aziz> Uh, did my computer debug?
[2:22:28] <nolifegamin> @ManfredA that is the greatest truth of life, you can never win
[2:22:29] <%Indigo_Automaton> World is a Fuck
[2:22:31] <leith_aziz> D:
[2:22:46] <%Charronia> Guess what, you annihilated the universe SilverShrug
[2:22:47] <%crybirb> @WoolieVersus one of the endings is after you get your arm, go to the Treasury save.
[2:22:51] <slackerunchained> All my homies hate this slot.
[2:22:51] <@Menitta> That's like
[2:22:52] <velgaduere> DEFINITELY not
[2:22:55] <%BackwardCap> Bye bitrate
[2:22:55] <Champstice> Oh I wanna see Pat's mind goblins re: saves fight this
[2:22:57] <4Jayco> oh god the bitrate
[2:23:01] <@Menitta> Simpsons esque
[2:23:01] <leith_aziz> Woolie's QA in full force
[2:23:13] <Wixvhen> I think that it's kinda like Professor Harkness animation. It's intended to make you feel uncomfortable and it lets you know that those feelings are natural multiple times, but also says 'We need you to do this, and we need you to trust us.' The only hint to how bad it gets is the ghosts and 'The Corridor'.
[2:23:18] <linSP> nier moment
[2:23:20] <leith_aziz> pickyYareYare
[2:23:27] <velgaduere> time to fight freaky-ass Scott Cawthon again
[2:23:27] <%crybirb> @WoolieVersus Treasury save and go to the galaxy room with the doors.
[2:23:43] <%Indigo_Automaton> I think that guy was thinking of the pacifist ending
[2:23:53] <kes009900> did woolie mention anything about Sifu?
[2:23:53] <%Indigo_Automaton> Which you can get immediately after receiving the arm
[2:23:54] <ManfredA> have they? killed anyone yet on this save
[2:23:57] <ordnavi> cat time. nya
[2:24:03] <ManfredA> no, good
[2:24:07] <%Explodincatz> @Wixvhen Plagues video?
[2:24:10] <Pookiedaexzile> There's nothing on this Route
[2:24:11] <%baronblank> don't think there's any difference between the gate of eternity save and this one in terms of getting endings
[2:24:31] <Wixvhen> Yes.
[2:24:38] <Yomamma1337> @WoolieVersus theres no difference between this save and the top one
[2:24:41] <%baronblank> except the gems of course
[2:24:45] <@Menitta> wait what
[2:24:48] <%Mr_Pylon> They ever beat Light Man?
[2:24:50] <DreiDD> ????
[2:24:58] <Pookiedaexzile> You only have the Fight wit the Light Being
[2:24:58] <%Charronia> vineJape
[2:24:59] <Furtive_Vulpine> uh oh
[2:25:01] <Yomamma1337> @WoolieVersus treasury save was for in case you didnt start with pacifist
[2:25:20] <%crybirb> @WoolieVersus Now just go to the galaxy room with the doors. And theres a new character there.
[2:25:29] <%Hapsam> we need frog emote
[2:25:29] <Yomamma1337> @crybirb you dont need this save for that
[2:25:40] <%crybirb> @crybirb No? Thought you needed it.
[2:25:41] <Daxalog> what emotion is frog
[2:25:49] <ManfredA> oh, have they already done pacifist?
[2:25:54] <%crybirb> @crybirb It was written to get the arm and go to the galaxy room.
[2:25:56] <%Mathochism> woolieONEGUY
[2:25:59] <Pookiedaexzile> Thanks One guy
[2:26:05] <Yomamma1337> @crybirb yes but they have the arm in the top save too
[2:26:25] <%crybirb> @crybirb Isn't the top save the one where they already started killing? I dunno for sure I only know the treasury was safe.
[2:26:34] <%Hapsam> PogChamp kero kero
[2:26:35] <Yomamma1337> @crybirb yes, and you can save and then go there
[2:26:35] <Pookiedaexzile> Just die here and load the other save
[2:26:37] <%baronblank> top save is right after pacifist ending
[2:26:40] <%baronblank> so no deaths
[2:26:42] <Yomamma1337> @crybirb kill*
[2:26:48] <ManfredA> oh then yeah they're golden
[2:26:49] <%crybirb> Oh didn't know, sorry guys

[2:27:14] <+ReallyBigRocks> keeping time at a really slow tempo is hard af
[2:27:25] <BlackermanZX> its so slow it fucks with your rythm
[2:27:27] <%Mr_Pylon> Get to platinum and then crash out of bronze on your other account
[2:27:39] <AppleBerryKitty> playing normal is hard playing hard is normal.  THUMPER in a nut
[2:27:45] <Pookiedaexzile> @crybirb You are now One guy, wear your crown
[2:28:07] <%crybirb> @crybirb Nooooo :(((
[2:28:09] <Yomamma1337> @WoolieVersus you can do that, its just that both saves work for that
[2:28:10] <%baronblank> new character is in both saves
[2:28:18] <nyacoo> It doesn't matter that mich
[2:28:43] <velgaduere> o shit

[2:29:02] <%crybirb> @BlackermanZX nope :(
[2:29:03] <Pookiedaexzile> That's NG plus shit, you'll see it either way
[2:29:09] <velgaduere> hi Sam
[2:29:09] <%crybirb> The gems are only for the dev battle no?
[2:29:13] <DSD24> He's cute
[2:29:14] <kenny_biff> <3
[2:29:16] <%Indigo_Automaton> @crybirb correct
[2:29:16] <+capybruhArt> hello sam
[2:29:17] <Sonny_Firestorm> One letter away from a bad time. KEKW
[2:29:22] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1490976552661979140?t=ZdiSmYj01DtZhJb8xco6Ig&s=19
[2:29:22] <%CaptainInvictus> MEOWMEOWMEOW
[2:29:24] <%jepupu> Eyes in the Dark... isn't that Norman Reedus' cat?
[2:29:25] <velgaduere> nyownyownyownyow
[2:29:28] <$Rafraud> nyan
[2:29:30] <QueequegTheater> Catstream Sam
[2:29:35] <%Hapsam> myowmyowmyowmyow
[2:29:50] <+capybruhArt> wait are we robbing a bank? thats morality i can get behind
[2:29:54] <Wixvhen> I can't wait to see the anime to see the 'Frogs are Foes' song. The actual name of the song is Revenge, but the first two songs are called 'Frogs are Friends', and it feels like a lost opportunity.
[2:30:06] <+anoldtoilet> sam as in samael?
[2:30:10] <+agumon9000> Go with sam
[2:30:12] <Pookiedaexzile> No Gems tho
[2:30:12] <%DashXero> We're gonna wind up killing this Sam thing, aren't we?
[2:30:15] <ordnavi> sam
[2:30:15] <%Indigo_Automaton> This is separate from the Gem Ending
[2:30:17] <hewsped> GO!
[2:30:18] <Champstice> This gunna be good
[2:30:19] <+DreyfussFrost> This is harder than the gem fight.
[2:30:21] <+JustToWatch> Apparently this guy is in the other save as well
[2:30:23] <BlackermanZX> you may want to do this on the other save file?
[2:30:25] <nyacoo> The mark of samael
[2:30:30] <+AurangeJuice> The song on this one is SO GOOD
[2:30:32] <Tisaric> this is probably the hardest fight\
[2:30:35] <Wixvhen> You can save here if you gotta.
[2:30:36] <%Indigo_Automaton> Yes it is
[2:30:37] <+DreyfussFrost> Yeah, it's the hardest
[2:30:37] <QueequegTheater> LP NOT OVER
[2:30:39] <%Indigo_Automaton> Correct
[2:30:54] <%Indigo_Automaton> Save on 3 yeah
[2:30:57] <Wixvhen> This is fine.
[2:30:59] <hewsped> sure
[2:31:00] <%Hapsam> right
[2:31:02] <zzNamttamzz> SeemsGood
[2:31:02] <ManfredA> yes
[2:31:04] <ManfredA> 100%
[2:31:19] <%Hapsam> oh no
[2:31:20] <ordnavi> aw
[2:31:22] <Champstice> okay phew
[2:31:22] <hewsped> why?
[2:31:27] <%crybirb> @WoolieVersus It shows anyway
[2:31:32] <ordnavi> cat time later
[2:31:49] <%crybirb> Lightman is going to take so long hahha
[2:31:58] <%Indigo_Automaton> New game+ Ending has two variants depending on whether a certain npc is alive or not.
[2:31:59] <Wixvhen> But his music is solid, so I don't mind this.
[2:32:00] <%Mr_Pylon> I love Lightman's song
[2:32:04] <+capybruhArt> is lightman the one with the vocals? i like that one
[2:32:09] <%Lion_kun> Do NG+ have more health
[2:32:12] <velgaduere> what if you say no this time tho
[2:32:14] <Champstice> @capybruhArt yeh
[2:32:15] <%crybirb> @capybruhArt yeah, the one about lov
[2:32:18] <+capybruhArt> nice
[2:32:27] <theemotionalacehearts> sam undertale
[2:32:29] <Tisaric> lightman might legit take the rest of the stream if he doesn't mess with the difficulty after too long

[2:33:35] <Yomamma1337> this is harder than light imo
[2:33:51] <+DreyfussFrost> Yeah... this is another level beyond Frog's Wrath or Light Being.

[2:35:19] <GHouseduivel> MEOW
[2:35:21] <+AurangeJuice> I wonder if Woolie recognizes the song
[2:35:22] <%DashXero> Uhm. Not that.
[2:35:22] <Visorak6> there are notes in front of the skulls
[2:35:25] <Mr_Rakjo> Light Guy
[2:35:28] <%Indigo_Automaton> You should do Light and Gems first
[2:35:31] <%DashXero> Light guy
[2:35:34] <leith_aziz> Cat or Light?
[2:35:36] <Visorak6> Light guy
[2:35:36] <+Toblo1> Light Guy
[2:35:36] <+maria_luke> youll need good timing for cat
[2:35:37] <ManfredA> Lights and Gems first
[2:35:38] <Mr_Rakjo> Gems First
[2:35:38] <Tisaric> yeah I'd do light guy first
[2:35:40] <Champstice> Woolie do Light Guy first
[2:35:40] <QueequegTheater> Light is easier
[2:35:44] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> will you spend two hours on this OR spend two hours on light guy Kappa Kappa
[2:35:45] <BlackermanZX> light seems easier
[2:35:46] <+PMAvers> Sans rolls up, puts down a folding chair and pulls out a bowl of popcorn.
[2:35:50] <leith_aziz> Light attracts cats pickySmug
[2:36:21] <ManfredA> Just that fight iirc
[2:36:21] <Mr_Rakjo> Its the same
[2:36:30] <Mr_Rakjo> nothing changes exept the new 2 endigs
[2:36:31] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:36:35] <+BigBruthaThunda> I didn't see anything different
[2:36:47] <Champstice> No new conclusion, it just adds some side stuff/side endings
[2:36:53] <hassanico2> Do the Fights until you give up, then Youtube the endings
[2:37:05] <ordnavi> extra dialogue here and there
[2:37:09] <Yomamma1337> there are like 3 small differences between normal and ng+
[2:37:13] <BlackermanZX> well if you don't have too much time you could just put it on easy mode
[2:37:27] <+Flarepulse> NG+ is just Cat God on and a couple hidden npcs based on some of the guest musicians, if I'm not mistaken
[2:37:44] <Champstice> yeah what flarepulse said, for the most part
[2:37:49] <+DreyfussFrost> New Game+ doesn't affect difficulty. It unlocks Insane difficulty but you have to opt into it.
[2:38:28] <$Rafraud> RNG time
[2:38:28] <%DashXero> Was that a living Rastabeast? How much did I miss?
[2:38:29] <CuttleCrow> gotta go all the way back out
[2:38:29] <Champstice> Oh fuck someone tell woolie to switch to insane mode for this fight
[2:38:31] <$Rafraud> YESSSSIIIIRRRR
[2:38:34] <%Indigo_Automaton> RNG time babey
[2:38:36] <Tisaric> it's an RNG roll if he's there
[2:38:41] <$Rafraud> Simply roll better
[2:38:41] <Wixvhen> Did you open the box yet?
[2:38:44] <@Menitta> wait really????
[2:38:44] <BlackermanZX> isnt it like 50% rng
[2:38:44] <CuttleCrow> 50%
[2:38:46] <%crybirb> Why is a RNG roll? That's kinda bs
[2:38:47] <nolifegamin> the first boss is RNG
[2:38:48] <ordnavi> you gotta leave the whole world
[2:38:53] <@Menitta> I hate that so much lmao

[2:39:10] <ordnavi> it is completely optional
[2:39:11] <Tisaric> yeah they put some stuff in RNG which really shouldn't be
[2:39:12] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Oh wait yeah did they open the box yet on this one
[2:39:14] <%baronblank> also a smaller random chance for the cat statue to appear in the hub
[2:39:23] <Wixvhen> Apparently they did!
[2:39:24] <%Indigo_Automaton> The cat statue is also a random chance upon entering the cosmic hub. a 9% chance if I'm not mistaken
[2:39:34] <@Menitta> but like....who gains from that??
[2:39:39] <Wixvhen> Probably 8% since 8 is a recurring theme.
[2:39:39] <%baronblank> yes
[2:39:39] <%Indigo_Automaton> Yes
[2:39:39] <QueequegTheater> tO bE qUiRkY
[2:39:40] <Nawji> I had to turn difficulty to   Normal  to beat like guy
[2:39:40] <Tisaric> yeah the cat statue is RNG based too
[2:39:42] <Tisaric> it's stupid
[2:39:43] <Yomamma1337> murder his ass
[2:39:44] <+AurangeJuice> The odds aren't super crazy or anything but yeah it's a bit obtuse

[2:42:11] <Tisaric> this fight is absolutely insane on hard or higher difficulty, even on normal it's a hard fight
[2:42:18] <@Menitta> like it's fine but to me its adjacent to Derezzed by Daft Punk in it's sound and the vocals make it worse imo
[2:42:18] <Wixvhen> Fun fact, the only difference between the easiest and hardest settings is how much damage you take and how much you regen.
[2:42:22] <@Menitta> but hey that's me
[2:42:24] <hassanico2> You need to be aggressive Louis!
[2:42:33] <@Menitta> More power to those that like it.
[2:42:33] <Tisaric> it's also the boss's HP as well @Wixvhen

[2:43:11] <+CourageTheCat> SourPls
[2:43:12] <CuttleCrow> you gotta be very aggressive on light guy
[2:43:14] <Wixvhen> Ah, this is also true, but essentially that means the game doesn't necessarily get easier, it just gets more survivable.
[2:43:21] <TheFramedWarlock> Did Woolie finish the game ?
[2:43:23] <leith_aziz> @Menitta You know what they say, music is subjective. I aint saying you're wrong. Me personally, im jamming pickyEZ
[2:43:35] <Yomamma1337> @Wixvhen untrue about fights like light guy, who are timed

[2:45:36] <%CaptainInvictus> this reminds me of when Selen played megaman 2 and didn't realize dpad was better and used the analog stick the entire game, only switching at wily alien lol
[2:45:39] <Tisaric> L O V E
[2:45:53] <nolifegamin> Woolie wearing them Rock Lee leg weights he didn't even know he had on
[2:45:55] <leith_aziz> doodBeamL doodBeam doodBeam doodBeam
[2:45:56] <Wixvhen> I did this on the easiest setting, and it's the -same- fight, just the HP values and regen differ. Technically it easier/harder because you have to do less to beat bosses, but on the flip side, it's still the same sound tracks and such. This means that you don't lose content just by going easier unless you' rush an enemy down.
[2:45:58] <+maria_luke> Woolie's heart is blazing
[2:46:05] <nyacoo> PIERCE THE HEAVENS
[2:46:15] <leith_aziz> Cant you hear him blazing!? pickyHype

[2:47:41] <leith_aziz> Why you bully me? pickyHuh
[2:47:46] <CuttleCrow> the rock to get to more content
[2:47:54] <Sonny_Firestorm> understandable
[2:48:12] <Futurecity10> worst part of this fight is the music sucks
[2:48:18] <Sonny_Firestorm> anyway, Imma lurk for now. Woolie please die less often I wanna hear the song
[2:48:31] <+maria_luke> lol
[2:48:53] <Tisaric> I think he's behind the DPS check this run
[2:49:16] <Sonny_Firestorm> DPS check? more like vibe check LUL
[2:49:21] <+maria_luke> oh right, we gonna look up incinerator later? (no way we're doing that run)
[2:49:24] <+TwitchGuy2021> @futurecity10 Awww :(
[2:49:41] <+AurangeJuice> this one is a personal achievement for me, as I somehow managed to beat this guy on the first try on Hard

[2:50:47] <+AurangeJuice> why did I reply to myself smh twitch @Yomamma1337 sorry yes I killed him
[2:51:03] <CuttleCrow> absorbing alternative colors hurts dps
[2:51:15] <Tisaric> the thread thing only shows the top of the thread for some reason
[2:51:27] <+AurangeJuice> that's dumb
[2:51:55] <Tisaric> I think it's meant to give context but it really should go off who you reply to
[2:52:03] <%derpumpkinking> Does the wooden hand actually do anything other than red text?
[2:52:11] <%OrangeMDT> Man, Imma need to start this play through over, cause I don‚Äôt get what‚Äôs happening at all
[2:53:09] <+maria_luke> "remember to eat" gotta eat your veggies lol jk
[2:53:45] <0rnan> Hm, red walls are rarer in the middle in the first segment
[2:53:50] <+goodnightxhunter> Whoa never heard of this game
[2:54:27] <+goodnightxhunter> Is the music original? Or licensed
[2:54:31] <0rnan> Then again myaybe not.
[2:54:33] <Yomamma1337> @0rnan the middle is the best place to be yeah
[2:54:41] <%Indigo_Automaton> @goodnightxhunter All original except for one track
[2:54:43] <+transrigs> @goodnightxhunter original I think
[2:54:49] <AppleBerryKitty> lytJIVE pandoraSing pandoraHI lytJIVE
[2:55:02] <+transrigs> This entire game soundtrack is incredible
[2:55:08] <$Rafraud> I think you need to memorize the reds tbh
[2:55:14] <CuttleCrow> reds are just traps
[2:55:27] <$Rafraud> Well reds are blocking so much of his damage
[2:55:30] <+goodnightxhunter> The music is dope
[2:55:35] <+maria_luke> Woolie, d'you need a water break?
[2:56:20] <$Rafraud> Like everytime he shoots a red or picks one up that's a dps loss. He needs to know where they are to avoid them
[2:56:29] <BlackermanZX> is he using the new tech
[2:56:30] <CuttleCrow> oh yea
[2:56:54] <CuttleCrow> to dodge instead of shooting at
[2:57:10] <$Rafraud> Perfect
[2:57:12] <$Rafraud> Just like that
[2:57:29] <$Rafraud> Know what I mean?
[2:57:34] <Yomamma1337> @Rafraud standing in 1 place does zero dps
[2:57:52] <$Rafraud> So does shooting the reds, he's gotta combine the two
[2:57:52] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1490976552661979140?t=ZdiSmYj01DtZhJb8xco6Ig&s=19
[2:58:05] <velgaduere> you gotta hit this sucker 50 times on this difficulty. sheesh
[2:58:07] <BlackermanZX> this is some good dps
[2:58:28] <Vi_Stri> yo this game is SICK
[2:58:45] <Lvl100_Charizard> NotLikeThis
[2:58:49] <$Rafraud> Damn that was really good
[2:58:50] <UberWolfman> dno7
[2:58:50] <Yomamma1337> was good until you moved out of the left
[2:58:53] <$Rafraud> Strat might be working
[2:59:31] <%baronblank> I think this was the hardest fight I beat on hard, anything past this I just moved to story mode cause I wanted to see the endings lol
[2:59:39] <BlackermanZX> just staying on the left side at the start seems pretty consistent
[2:59:50] <%OrangeMDT> What are the lyrics?
[2:59:57] <%OrangeMDT> I can‚Äôt hear
[3:00:04] <CuttleCrow> the sides are safer, but its harder to dip for the oranges
[3:00:07] <majindusto> Oof

[3:04:33] <Daxalog> Is this a genre of music i want more of it
[3:04:33] <ManfredA> I wish I could ever vibe as hard as Light Being tbh
[3:05:00] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:05:00] <AppleBerryKitty> its only like 2 minutes
[3:05:30] <dg4ii> @Daxalog idk but it was coproduced by "dancefloor is lava"
[3:05:58] <greatspaceadventure> is this boss beatable without the arm?
[3:06:05] <Tisaric> just some form of electro basically, could just look up electropop/house with vocals to get similar stuff
[3:06:11] <HR_Freud> I wanna be light being-kin
[3:06:13] <dg4ii> @greatspaceadventure you need the arm to reach it
[3:06:22] <dg4ii> but yes you can beat it without killing it
[3:06:26] <dg4ii> but you don't get anything for it
[3:06:28] <greatspaceadventure> @greatspaceadventure do you? cus i reached it before i got the arm
[3:06:40] <Tisaric> there's no way to get to this fight without the arm
[3:06:45] <dg4ii> maybe i'm misremembering
[3:07:09] <greatspaceadventure> i may have sequence broken somehow... i'm not lying i promise!
[3:07:25] <Yomamma1337> light man simply requires the golden key, golden key just requires the fetch quest
[3:07:42] <CuttleCrow> you can bring the battery back from the desert if you backtrack
[3:07:45] <Tisaric> oh yeah that's true, you could actually just backtrack
[3:07:53] <greatspaceadventure> that is exactly what i did
[3:08:00] <Tisaric> but yeah you can't actually beat him without it
[3:08:05] <greatspaceadventure> cool, thanks for the confirmation that i just need to git gud LUL
[3:08:16] <dg4ii> oh yeah you can fight light being before getting the arm i just checked the wiki
[3:08:37] <Nawji> I had to beat him on normal
[3:08:40] <nolifegamin> easy mode refuses to be unlocked
[3:08:44] <dg4ii> it requires backtracking when you get the car battery

[3:09:10] <Tisaric> If I were to do this fight I'd definitely switch it down to normal myself
[3:09:46] <Yomamma1337> youre missing a lot of notes you can absorb
[3:09:56] <$Rafraud> coming from rhythm games, there are hard ddr charts that I literally have committed to memory. I don't even watch them at some point just cause it's the only way sometimes
[3:10:12] <Nawji> Just turn the difficulty down man You can always turn it back
[3:10:17] <$Rafraud> No video watching is literally optimal sometimes lol
[3:10:37] <Tisaric> it's not worth the time effort playing it on hard IMO, but you do whatever you'd like
[3:10:50] <Yomamma1337> i recommend going way more aggressive than you are already
[3:10:54] <BlackermanZX> well theres a no hit and kill video in yt
[3:11:08] <%DashXero> These are good questions.
[3:11:12] <CuttleCrow> you did "harder" fights on hard, this is one fight that is okay to put on normal lol
[3:11:31] <%crybirb> He is not going to finish today if he doens't put on normal
[3:11:45] <AppleBerryKitty> we're old now woolie...
[3:11:46] <Tisaric> yeah it could literally take all stream to keep it on hard
[3:11:49] <%JuliusGemstone> we keeping it going?
[3:12:02] <%JuliusGemstone> !uptime
[3:12:02] <@Moobot> @JuliusGemstone WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 34 minutes
[3:12:09] <%emptyantics> Woolie just change it to Normal, you won‚Äôt be able to beat it, it‚Äôs fuckin rough
[3:12:09] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:12:13] <%crybirb> nobody doubts you can do it if you have the time, just go for the possible now
[3:12:13] <AppleBerryKitty> *cough* chats old
[3:12:14] <dg4ii> has woolie seen the cat npc yet
[3:12:15] <kadjah> kindle the bonfire
[3:12:20] <+Nobrev> this song is burned into my head because I watced another streamer do this fight over and over for days
[3:12:26] <+AurangeJuice> I would say try to absorb to save yourself from damage more.
[3:12:39] <%DashXero> @dg4ii Yes.
[3:12:42] <dg4ii> i think desertpopanga did this fight for 3 streams and then never played again
[3:12:53] <Tisaric> yeah desertp had it rough with this fight
[3:13:05] <+AurangeJuice> @dg4ii that's because the game had a memory leak problem at the time that made this fight literally impossible
[3:13:06] <Tisaric> which is a shame since it spoiled him on the rest of the game
[3:13:06] <+Nobrev> yeah desertp whas who I watched
[3:13:21] <dg4ii> oh huh
[3:13:37] <Yomamma1337> you can double catch the wall, you were just too slow there
[3:14:04] <+AurangeJuice> also apparently desert was going through a hard time in general when he was doing this fight and he said that was the main reason
[3:14:12] <+AurangeJuice> who knows if he'll come back to it
[3:14:23] <+AurangeJuice> I hope so tho
[3:14:38] <%emptyantics> I love this song so much
[3:15:00] <nyacoo> you can do it
[3:15:01] <Tisaric> just swallow your pride and change the difficulty LUL
[3:15:09] <majindusto> FIGHT ON
[3:15:15] <Yomamma1337> you can go out of your way to try catching more, even if it kills you
[3:15:16] <AppleBerryKitty> this WILL take long, you really gotta get into his face.
[3:15:18] <%baronblank> pretty much yea
[3:15:19] <ManfredA> if it's any consolation I think this is the only fight that made Jerma drop to normal
[3:15:22] <%Indigo_Automaton> That's fair
[3:15:23] <%cobalt_phoenix_> nothing wrong with that
[3:15:24] <velgaduere> yeah aight
[3:15:28] <%DashXero> Why is Woolie playing on hard?!
[3:15:29] <velgaduere> I'm getting tired of the song anyway lmao
[3:15:31] <Tisaric> yeah that's the smart choice
[3:15:36] <@Menitta> I'd say change difficulty because its for endings
[3:15:40] <velgaduere> @DashXero always has been
[3:15:41] <BlackermanZX> yeah woolz can totally do it on hard but it will take time
[3:15:43] <Nawji> He has so much health you have to do it super   clean to beat him
[3:15:44] <@Menitta> the game told him to.
[3:15:45] <nyacoo> @DashXero gamer pride(?)
[3:15:47] <+El_Rabbit> Y/ou have to lab it
[3:15:49] <Tisaric> @DashXero a lot of people fall into the trap of it being the default and not switching off of it
[3:15:53] <+theoldone001> At this point we're here for the rest of the plot. We already know gameplay
[3:15:54] <Yomamma1337> big oof
[3:15:54] <Nawji> His health is way more reasonable than normal
[3:16:01] <Pookiedaexzile> And the game aint even that good
[3:16:04] <BlackermanZX> you need lab time
[3:16:05] <%DashXero> Cheese Louise.
[3:16:06] <%derpumpkinking> this is a huge difference for you. I agree
[3:16:11] <BlackermanZX> you need batman prep time
[3:16:15] <+Ricky_Rexx> If you slam your head into the mountain enough times, it will fall first
[3:16:15] <HarshNerf> @pookiedaexzile facts
[3:16:16] <%livlinn> It‚Äôs okay
[3:16:22] <velgaduere> this dude's about to melt now
[3:16:26] <AppleBerryKitty> i mean, nothing will change lowering the setting right? no harm done.
[3:16:37] <Yomamma1337> @AppleBerryKitty the difficulty changes.  thats the point
[3:16:43] <Tisaric> the main change is the HP goes WAY down
[3:16:50] <AppleBerryKitty> i mean like ending wise
[3:16:50] <Tisaric> so it's not nearly as hard of a race
[3:16:53] <ManfredA> this guy is a really awkward dps race
[3:16:54] <velgaduere> like this fight is clearly still a challenge regardless
[3:17:17] <Tisaric> yeah the challenge is still there since the notes are all still the same
[3:17:24] <+cubbywolf> S L I N K
[3:17:29] <+theoldone001> I feel like there should have been an arm upgrade at some point.
[3:17:29] <Saltmeisterr> we fighting the light man again?
[3:17:30] <+cubbywolf> wait S - L I N K
[3:17:48] <velgaduere> @theoldone001 some kind of... buster............
[3:18:12] <Tisaric> yeah he's got this easily on normal
[3:18:33] <velgaduere> @Tisaric and that's still after a ton of practice
[3:18:36] <%derpumpkinking> The difficulty makes a HUGE differnce.
[3:18:53] <CuttleCrow> almost
[3:18:55] <Tisaric> yeah it's a fucking insane difficulty spike
[3:19:00] <nyacoo> oof

[3:26:07] <Pookiedaexzile> @ordnavi A GAME THEORY
[3:26:10] <ordnavi> a game theory
[3:26:13] <Yomamma1337> 9% haha

[3:26:14] <ordnavi> fuck
[3:26:16] <%Indigo_Automaton> He's Jessie Pinkman-Garfield
[3:26:17] <dg4ii> it appears because of RNG
[3:26:18] <nyacoo> 9%
[3:26:19] <ManfredA> time to roll
[3:26:20] <ordnavi> too alow
[3:26:22] <+Flarepulse> go save
[3:26:22] <%Indigo_Automaton> Random chance
[3:26:23] <+maria_luke> Ready to attack and dethrone god?

[3:26:25] <CuttleCrow> 9% for statue, do the cat doo
[3:26:26] <Tisaric> 9% chance baby
[3:26:27] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> the cat statue has a 9% chance to show up
[3:26:29] <jett_eyes> There's a chance it'll apear, just keep going in and out of a door
[3:26:31] <%baronblank> lamp woolie
[3:26:34] <Tisaric> @WoolieVersus remember it's RNG as well
[3:26:35] <%cobalt_phoenix_> 9%
[3:26:35] <nyacoo> 9% chance
[3:26:39] <%Indigo_Automaton> Yeah I mentioned that earlier
[3:26:39] <+DreyfussFrost> Yeah it's also RNG
[3:26:41] <%baronblank> 9% yea
[3:26:42] <%cobalt_phoenix_> pray to rngsus now
[3:26:43] <BlackermanZX> oh the statue 9%
[3:26:46] <+BigBruthaThunda> Woolie said it was 9% like an hour ago
[3:26:49] <GoogleyGareth> Alright time to chill for a min LUL
[3:26:54] <GoogleyGareth> oh nvm
[3:26:55] <@Menitta> that's just annoying
[3:26:56] <velgaduere> what great design
[3:26:56] <%emptyantics> Here it comes

[3:27:04] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> SSR get Kappa
[3:27:08] <AppleBerryKitty> lol why's that of all things rng
[3:27:08] <ordnavi> ITS OPTIONAL CHAT
[3:27:08] <majindusto> RNJESUS SAYS LOL
[3:27:09] <Tisaric> I don't get why the insist on the RNG rolls for that
[3:27:09] <Pookiedaexzile> DON"T YOU LIKE SECRECTS
[3:27:10] <velgaduere> "hey guys remember UT/DR??"
[3:27:14] <%baronblank> yes, save 1
[3:27:14] <Yomamma1337> doesnt matter which save
[3:27:15] <CuttleCrow> 1
[3:27:15] <nolifegamin> the rng adds to the sense of discovery, mystery, and mystique this game has Kappa
[3:27:33] <BlackermanZX> isnt save 3 useless at this point
[3:27:38] <Tisaric> it's just a time waster at this point
[3:27:40] <Tisaric> which is dumb
[3:27:41] <dg4ii> i like to defend this game but everything related to RNG in this game is kinda ass
[3:27:44] <Yomamma1337> @BlackermanZX we only need 1 save now

[3:30:21] <%baronblank> no, difficulty changes back iirc
[3:30:25] <%baronblank> so this is on hard
[3:30:28] <%baronblank> I think

[3:30:30] <Pookiedaexzile> Reggie  Keeping Woolie Honest
[3:30:34] <ordnavi> no it doesnt
[3:30:37] <Tisaric> I forget, is this a damage boss or do you just have to survive?
[3:30:39] <+theoldone001> Dev-Kun is here to punish you for shit talking the RNG of the Statue.
[3:30:44] <%derpumpkinking> this fight is a little rough even on normal honestly.
[3:30:45] <Tisaric> I think the difficulty should still be on normal

[3:32:58] <ordnavi> the notes are all black
[3:32:59] <%Charronia> I guess the fight against the light guy was just a qualifier round for this guy limesGiggle
[3:33:05] <kazadaz> Man this song rules
[3:33:08] <dg4ii> @cowkid222 they understood fairly quickly
[3:33:11] <velgaduere> @cubbywolf seems to be purely survival, which is frankly easier
[3:33:20] <Tisaric> yeah IIRC this is just a survival fight
[3:33:20] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:33:21] <+cowkid222> rad, just got here and was curious
[3:33:22] <+cubbywolf> oh these all have black i see
[3:33:23] <ManfredA> this is one of the fights that story mode doesn't change the charting of
[3:33:25] <+Jiggisnipe> they understand that it is their maker Kappa
[3:33:26] <Yomamma1337> @Tisaric nope

[3:35:54] <%derpumpkinking> Definitely gonna be dodging for a bit
[3:36:01] <%emptyantics> Some one modded Barbie Girl into this and made it borderline impossible to beat
[3:36:25] <+theoldone001> A modded fight against Vergil would be sick
[3:36:29] <+Jrockoni> this drop is honestly incredible tho
[3:36:34] <+Jiggisnipe> IKR
[3:36:34] <Pookiedaexzile> I'm Waitng for Neo to start fighting some Agents to this
[3:36:38] <+Jiggisnipe> this fight is hype
[3:36:45] <mrtanaka111> did woolie learnt to love everhood yet?
[3:36:46] <CuttleCrow> it hasn't even begun
[3:36:47] <%baronblank> it's not even the hardest part of the song
[3:36:48] <%derpumpkinking> neither end is safe my friend
[3:36:49] <%DashXero> Center?
[3:36:51] <Tisaric> we're in superboss territory baby
[3:36:53] <AngryAsian5> "Get fucked" says the game LUL
[3:37:02] <Yomamma1337> diagonal jumping between 4 and 5 is how i do it
[3:37:13] <%derpumpkinking> 2-3 or 4-3
[3:37:20] <+transrigs> oof
[3:37:25] <HR_Freud> "this technically shouldn't be possible, prove your skills"
[3:37:26] <%emptyantics> A real Superboss this time.
[3:37:33] <Tisaric> god I love that super fast snare roll sound so much
[3:37:39] <nolifegamin> yea I'm seeing some frame skips
[3:37:47] <dg4ii> one of my favorite modcharts is the Clipping WAKE UP remix one
[3:38:07] <glass_marcus> this feel like a game where optimal performance is mandatory
[3:38:18] <DarknessHS> LUL
[3:38:20] <dg4ii> I don't even know how they got clean audio from that one minecraft concert performance but they did
[3:38:21] <%derpumpkinking> I actually think theres only one unwinnable fight in the game
[3:38:25] <Yomamma1337> middle sucks
[3:38:29] <nolifegamin> oh that part is fucked up
[3:39:00] <BlackermanZX> and here i thought frog was the insane fight
[3:39:04] <dg4ii> all the fights are beatable, I managed to beat the NG Boss both by killing it and not
[3:39:05] <Tisaric> I do love that the devs weren't afraid to just absolutely flood the board at some points in these fights
[3:39:06] <ManfredA> btw this fight has no checkpoints
[3:39:13] <CuttleCrow> frogs got nothing on the superbosses

[3:41:19] <velgaduere> LMAO OH NO
[3:41:21] <stevenellis386> YIKES
[3:41:21] <%Indigo_Automaton> HAHAHA NO
[3:41:21] <jett_eyes> checkpoint
[3:41:23] <Yomamma1337> "checkpoint" he says
[3:41:23] <nyacoo> HAHA NO
[3:41:24] <jett_eyes> lol
[3:41:24] <DarknessHS> oh god
[3:41:24] <XScytheMata> there goes the 4th wall
[3:41:25] <+Jiggisnipe> be perfect
[3:41:26] <Pookiedaexzile> "Checkpoint" Lol
[3:41:26] <Wixvhen> THere are no checkpoints!
[3:41:28] <Wixvhen> AHAHAHAH!
[3:41:29] <+cubbywolf> RiP
[3:41:29] <nolifegamin> the only checkpoint is "GET GUD"
[3:41:29] <+Grayhammatter> lol, lmao
[3:41:30] <+Fetrigon> no checkpoints
[3:41:34] <AppleBerryKitty> naw you gonna suffer as G did
[3:41:35] <%emptyantics> NO CHECKPOINT LUL LUL
[3:41:36] <BlackermanZX> oh god no checkpoints thats just evil
[3:41:40] <%Indigo_Automaton> ASSUME?
[3:41:42] <+Jiggisnipe> is this the hardest boss?
[3:41:42] <Yomamma1337> yessir
[3:41:43] <Teradyne87> A checkpoint? During Free Bird?!
[3:41:43] <velgaduere> this is ass lmao
[3:41:50] <ManfredA> @Jiggisnipe it's between this and the cat
[3:41:52] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> like how the fuck do you fight back during this lol
[3:41:53] <jordi_therock> you just have to win ex
[3:41:53] <Yomamma1337> @Jiggisnipe id argue killing the cat is harder
[3:41:55] <dg4ii> Chris (purple gnome) experience extreme burnout at one point so it was mainly Blue gnome (forgot their name) that worked on engine stuff for a long time, and that's reflected in this fight.
[3:41:56] <Nawji> this is doable once you learn the spastic waves rough up until then
[3:42:00] <dg4ii> Which I think is cool
[3:42:00] <XScytheMata> assuming checkpoints LUL
[3:42:02] <Wixvhen> Your checkpoint is 'Finish the fight.'
[3:42:06] <%Indigo_Automaton> It's not as long of a song as the other though
[3:42:07] <%emptyantics> Superboss [CLIMAX]
[3:42:11] <%derpumpkinking> @jiggisnipe I had more trouble with ng+ boss
[3:42:15] <Pookiedaexzile> Be Perfection
[3:42:17] <Xenomenas> I only managed to beat this one on easy
[3:42:18] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> This is the coolest boss in the game
[3:42:22] <+Jrockoni> Nah they aint got nothing to say. you played what they had to say.
[3:42:23] <+transrigs> 1. Play Everhood, Step 2. Dreaw the rest of the fucking owl
[3:42:25] <jordi_therock> EZ
[3:42:33] <$Rafraud> I do heavily vibe with this song lol
[3:42:44] <+AurangeJuice> This fight even reflects the story of the development of this game. The purple gnome, who represents Chris, starting development but ultimately burning out and being absent for a time, while the blue gnome, Jordi, works on it in his absence. Chris later comes back periodically to contribute to development of the game
[3:42:49] <AppleBerryKitty> lytJIVE lytLEERY
[3:42:52] <+Jiggisnipe> this beat is so good
[3:42:53] <%Indigo_Automaton> THE BEST
[3:42:56] <nolifegamin> this song SLAPS
[3:43:10] <jett_eyes> smooth, woolie
[3:43:16] <%derpumpkinking> On insane difficulty this fight has extra animations for them.
[3:43:16] <+Grayhammatter> smooth
[3:43:23] <%emptyantics> My favourite track Kreygasm
[3:43:24] <mrtanaka111> are we the everhood?
[3:43:26] <%Indigo_Automaton> Song's name is 72 - Lolita As Roxy if anyone wants to know
[3:43:26] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> dodge & weave, bob & steve
[3:43:35] <+commoncurium> FUCK THIS BEAT SLAPS hboxNODDERS hboxNODDERS hboxNODDERS
[3:43:37] <jett_eyes> o h y e a h
[3:43:37] <dg4ii> I like this song more than the NG fight song, mainly because unlike WHY OH YOU ARE the static just washes everything else out. Wish the bass was more present in that song
[3:43:59] <kinkade_77> how are you supposed to know
[3:44:00] <+AurangeJuice> you can technically move over fast enough but it has to be really fast
[3:44:02] <ManfredA> this fight is technically a NG fight
[3:44:03] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> did he finished the game
[3:44:13] <%Explodincatz> the sides look like death most of the time
[3:44:15] <bippityjones> You can't double shift a triple shift
[3:44:16] <Wixvhen> Yeah, he's doing the optionals, now.
[3:44:22] <%pkthepipes> Show those Muppets who's boss!!!
[3:44:30] <%emptyantics> You gotta schmoove
[3:44:33] <+cubbywolf> try a different controller too
[3:44:35] <dg4ii> no? You can do it as your first ending. (Getting your arm doesn't count)
[3:44:36] <Tisaric> yeah this fight seems like it would be a bit better on keyboard since you can spam arrow keys a lot faster
[3:44:55] <ManfredA> I actually did better on pad for everhood's harder fights
[3:45:00] <ManfredA> mostly comes down to preference
[3:45:02] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> I lowered the difficulty here
[3:45:20] <%derpumpkinking> @manfreda Same. really boils down to what your fingers feel comfortable hitting the fastest.
[3:45:21] <Tisaric> I played on keyboard myself and at times it definitely felt like I got away with moving way faster than I should've
[3:46:12] <dg4ii> I played on keyboard until I realized I could press an A button a lot faster than I could press my spacebar for some reason
[3:46:29] <dg4ii> also I can't accidentally press right when I meant to absorb
[3:46:31] <ManfredA> I was an idiot and played 90% of the game hitting the down key to deflect
[3:46:37] <+commoncurium> woolieGASM woolieGASM woolieGASM woolieGASM woolieGASM
[3:46:44] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> pepeD
[3:46:45] <Tisaric> yeah I'd say the actual reflecting mechanics on keyboard are not as good as controller I'll definitely admit
[3:46:51] <%emptyantics> woolieCHAN woolieCHAN woolieCHAN woolieCHAN
[3:46:55] <Wixvhen> 1,1,2
[3:46:58] <Tisaric> I think I did the whole game hitting down to reflect on keyboard LUL
[3:46:59] <AppleBerryKitty> If you need to take a moment do so.
[3:46:59] <%DashXero> Huh. This one seems to be telling a story.
[3:47:01] <Pookiedaexzile> Junglist Music make hte heart go
[3:47:06] <0rnan> "How many" my sides
[3:47:07] <%pkthepipes> there are indeed 2
[3:47:11] <$Rafraud> "TWO"
[3:47:23] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> did he do the cat
[3:47:24] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:47:26] <%pkthepipes> but have you considered 2?
[3:47:43] <Tisaric> no cat yet, I think he tried once but went to do gem stuff first
[3:47:44] <dg4ii> I learned how to run a keyswap script after my time with everhood. Having a key to deflect that wasn't down probrably would have made fights like this much easier
[3:47:45] <%Afterman_> oooh shit
[3:47:53] <MadBaller123> I wish you could practice segments like Tohou let's you practice spell cards
[3:48:02] <dg4ii> @The_Forgotten_Alligator made one attempt and decided to go WHY OH YOU ARE first
[3:48:15] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> well he shoulda done the cat first lol, this is way harder
[3:48:24] <dg4ii> eh, depends on who you ask
[3:48:27] <Yomamma1337> @The_Forgotten_Alligator killing the cat is harder imo
[3:48:43] <Tisaric> also he wanted to do the NG stuff before the NG+ stuff
[3:49:13] <0rnan> Crazy that he gets two cursors
[3:49:15] <+Cecrios> So close!
[3:49:19] <dg4ii> I've beaten the cat but not the gnomes but that's mainly because I was losing interest due to realizing there was no way in hell I was 100%ing this game
[3:49:53] <%derpumpkinking> NG+ boss is WAY harder because of whats happening with the track imo. It throws me off so hard. the only fight I couldn't do on Insane.
[3:50:15] <Tisaric> even just seeing how hard light guy was I was totally fine just watching these superboss fights on yt after beating the main game
[3:50:15] <+cubbywolf> so close yet so far
[3:50:28] <Tisaric> like these are really cool fights but I'm good
[3:50:43] <+cubbywolf> Woolie: I DIDNT SIGN UP FOR THIS BUT ITS WHAT IM DOING!
[3:50:48] <Blank9> music's eh too
[3:51:03] <Tisaric> nah this song bangs
[3:51:14] <dg4ii> they meant the NG fight
[3:51:22] <Yomamma1337> right side is the same but easier
[3:51:24] <+cubbywolf> those frames are a nightmare
[3:51:27] <+Jiggisnipe> maybe restart game?
[3:51:40] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> right side looked free
[3:51:42] <%emptyantics> Restart the game Wools
[3:51:58] <+cubbywolf> LUL
[3:52:00] <Tisaric> yeah I'd restart the game to clear out the memory
[3:52:07] <%derpumpkinking> Starting to get a leaky bud yeah
[3:52:17] <+cubbywolf> yeah
[3:52:22] <+cubbywolf> its obvious to me now
[3:52:22] <Tisaric> oh yeah it's getting bad
[3:52:23] <%emptyantics> woolieCHAN
[3:52:26] <BlackermanZX> man the devs must despise bitrate with passion
[3:52:36] <%Explodincatz> empty the memory bladder
[3:52:36] <Pookiedaexzile> Feels like Blade is gonna kill some Vampires to this
[3:52:38] <+CourageTheCat> this is sex
[3:52:44] <ManfredA> I love this part
[3:52:44] <dg4ii> One thing I can say is, I really look forward to a game by these devs that learns from the mistakes of Everhood.
[3:52:44] <+CourageTheCat> @Pookiedaexzile YEAH
[3:52:48] <Tisaric> shame they weren't able to get rid off all the memory leaks, though it does seem a lot better than it used to be
[3:53:00] <dg4ii> The next foreign gnome game? That's going to be FIRE
[3:53:06] <+cubbywolf> Right?
[3:53:19] <+commoncurium> I feel like 2 and 3 are still the best lanes there
[3:53:20] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> monkaS are we sure
[3:53:21] <%derpumpkinking> Well one dev literally kept working himself to complete exhaustion. You better believe he wants to kill bitrate.
[3:53:25] <Tisaric> yeah it'll be really cool to see where they go from here
[3:53:27] <Yomamma1337> @commoncurium 4 and 5 are
[3:53:28] <+cubbywolf> Foreign gnomes and their games
[3:53:33] <+cubbywolf> stick to underpants you gnomes
[3:53:45] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> the npcs on new game plus hint to a new game
[3:53:49] <%emptyantics> I hope they make a rhythm game
[3:53:50] <Pookiedaexzile> Gnot a Gnoblin
[3:54:06] <%Indigo_Automaton> Woolie will have to dance battle the toilet
[3:54:06] <%Jrockoni> Kinda ominous Reggie
[3:54:09] <+cubbywolf> the toughest battle, Reggie vs chat
[3:54:15] <%emptyantics> LUL LUL
[3:54:18] <%robosqueeb> hi reggie
[3:54:19] <BlackermanZX> pissing is a hard battle
[3:54:21] <AppleBerryKitty> chat stand up and you back needs it
[3:54:24] <+cubbywolf> yeah I have it installed
[3:54:24] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:54:26] <%DashXero> Sifu looks dope.
[3:54:26] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> SIFU is big cool
[3:54:29] <nolifegamin> yea Sifu is pretty sick
[3:54:31] <+cubbywolf> I bought it even on the EGS which i hate
[3:54:32] <velgaduere> hell yeah dude
[3:54:32] <%Jrockoni> yeyeyeye
[3:54:32] <Tisaric> yeah I'd really like to see them refine this gameplay so it's actually on the beat somehow
[3:54:34] <+cubbywolf> fucking egs
[3:54:39] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> SIFU is also big difficult
[3:54:41] <Dopamien> monkaS
[3:54:45] <@Menitta> Oh no
[3:54:47] <$Rafraud> @WoolieVersus I agree with you and Woolie on the story implications, but thinking on it now, where do you fall on pet euthanizing where a pet literally can't consent?
[3:54:51] <%IGgy_IGsen> Pissin in a bottle again
[3:54:54] <+cubbywolf> say goodbye to your package on your doorstep
[3:54:55] <%emptyantics> Game Journos crying about SIFU LUL
[3:54:56] <%DashXero> Woolie shouldn't have much of a problem with Sifu.
[3:55:01] <%crybirb> I believe this is another case where in the next day, or after Woolie rests, he will crush it.
[3:55:03] <MurseJOCO> Hi Reggie from L.A. ü§ôüèª
[3:55:10] <dg4ii> @Tisaric you kind of get a glimpse at that with the jump rope fight, it was alright
[3:55:10] <%Jrockoni> Woolie and Reggie play crusader kings, when?
[3:55:18] <velgaduere> you
[3:55:18] <+Jiggisnipe> lol
[3:55:19] <velgaduere> what
[3:55:20] <%crybirb> Woolie CRUSHED frog in the session after the first one
[3:55:21] <+cubbywolf> prairy oisters
[3:55:24] <%townzzzzz> you sleep buying
[3:55:27] <BlackermanZX> reggie ordered a frog plushie for woolz
[3:55:28] <%derpumpkinking> @rafraud Thats what behind the shed is for.
[3:55:29] <DreiDD> cow ears?
[3:55:29] <AppleBerryKitty> wut
[3:55:30] <dg4ii> also the one section in Cat fight
[3:55:30] <kinkade_77> what are you excited for in the direct?
[3:55:33] <Daxalog> for eating
[3:55:34] <MurseJOCO> Box of dilds
[3:55:38] <%jinking79> ordering the Frog plush
[3:55:39] <+cubbywolf> that means the UPS man wants to sleep with you. so sayeth the lord xenu
[3:55:46] <AppleBerryKitty> cows are COOL i won't question why!
[3:55:52] <%emptyantics> Reggie como te sientes? Y porque chingados compraste orejas de vaca?!
[3:56:04] <%DashXero> Cow ears make good dog treats.
[3:56:12] <%emptyantics> Cow ears for‚Ä¶coitous Kappa
[3:56:19] <+cubbywolf> my dogs dont like cow ears anymore
[3:56:43] <Daxalog> Your not this far unless you "with it"
[3:56:50] <+robertoszek> the U-word
[3:56:54] <+Jiggisnipe> the music
[3:57:02] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> I knew he was going to say undertale
[3:57:04] <BlackermanZX> honestly i get more yume nikki vibes than undertale
[3:57:22] <Tisaric> oh yeah it's targeting the acidheads out there HARD
[3:57:33] <nolifegamin> it's a niche
[3:57:34] <%robosqueeb> the Adderall rhythm game fanatic
[3:57:35] <Daxalog> a bunch of doors in an abyss with their own worlds is very Yume Niki. Unless yume niki got that from something else?
[3:57:35] <Yomamma1337> fans of undertale and rhythm games?
[3:57:36] <%emptyantics> It feels like a combo of Yume Nikki and Undertale
[3:57:37] <+cubbywolf> Well done. But... One More Thing.... how did you know they where stabbed as well as shot if they where shot in the spot they where stabbed in?
[3:57:39] <dg4ii> eh. The only Yume Nikki thing about this game is the doors and *vaguely waves at the aztec imagery*
[3:57:39] <%DashXero> "If you're not that kind of guy, get the hell out!"
[3:57:55] <Furtive_Vulpine> yeah, it knows its audience
[3:58:16] <+Jiggisnipe> you like challenges right
[3:58:17] <%arkv01> yeah you've nailed the description for its target market
[3:58:21] <@Menitta> This feels like the equivalent of getting to the end of Bloody Palace
[3:58:24] <Dopamien> story wise? or gameplay wise? I like trippy games but this story narrative is poop
[3:58:36] <Yomamma1337> rhythm game fans like hard rhythm games
[3:58:38] <%derpumpkinking> I love this game, but it kinda falls apart on its own existentialism.
[3:58:41] <BlackermanZX> the target audience is that one music guy in disco elysium
[3:58:49] <+Jiggisnipe> HARDCORE
[3:58:49] <%Jrockoni> Made by fiends for fiends
[3:58:52] <+cubbywolf> yes, rhythm game fans are terrible people i agree
[3:58:55] <AppleBerryKitty> "thumper"
[3:58:57] <%emptyantics> It‚Äôs a schmup and a rhythm game
[3:58:59] <dg4ii> I liked the story personally but the very ending was indisputably ass.
[3:59:03] <Tisaric> HARDCORE TO THE MAX
[3:59:14] <ManfredA> I don't really think that the game has much to do with UT beyond people trying to pigeonhole indie games with themes
[3:59:16] <Atomic_Blowfish> ALL CORE HARD CORE ALRIGHT!
[3:59:16] <%derpumpkinking> HARDCORE TO THE MEGA
[3:59:20] <Atomic_Blowfish> YEEEEAGGHH
[3:59:25] <%emptyantics> Ending is underwhelming compared to the rest of the game
[3:59:28] <+cubbywolf> LUL
[3:59:32] <nolifegamin> the story had a lot of fun moments, but the deeper stuff could use some tweaks
[3:59:34] <dg4ii> is it? is it hardcore?
[3:59:39] <$Rafraud> Quirky
[3:59:40] <CuttleCrow> try the other boss?

[3:59:46] <%emptyantics> ThankEgg LUL LUL
[3:59:48] <Tisaric> it falters a good amount at the ending but I think the rest of it is worth it
[3:59:51] <+cubbywolf> im sorry im jk
[3:59:57] <+cubbywolf> its funny

[4:00:06] <+Jiggisnipe> I get the secrets aspect, but it's annoying when you already know
[4:00:15] <dg4ii> they should have the statue randomly appear during the arm segment and then just stay there permanently.
[4:00:19] <AppleBerryKitty> whats the % of this again?!
[4:00:22] <Tisaric> 9%
[4:00:23] <ManfredA> 9%
[4:00:24] <Tisaric> it's insane

[4:00:27] <%emptyantics> 9%
[4:00:28] <Dova573> Honestly this game makes me appreciate undertale/Deltarune more and how easy is to bumble these type of games
[4:00:44] <+CourageTheCat> MEOW MEOW
[4:00:51] <%emptyantics> MEOX MIX
[4:00:54] <Dopamien> lmao
[4:01:00] <dg4ii> Undertale is great because it's almost perfect. Everhood is great because it's charmingly flawed.
[4:01:01] <AppleBerryKitty> i meant to look up the lore of delta.
[4:01:05] <+cubbywolf> LUL
[4:01:13] <mikash91> heh
[4:01:13] <+CourageTheCat> yeah
[4:01:14] <nolifegamin> @Dova573 turns out making games is real hard
[4:01:15] <%derpumpkinking> Honestly this type of story gets me excited for Death Trash for some reason.
[4:01:15] <puluxor> majinoNeko majinoNeko majinoNeko majinoNeko
[4:01:15] <+CourageTheCat> pretty much
[4:01:17] <kinkade_77> i dont like overly meta things

[4:01:19] <scrumbotime> Yes
[4:01:20] <dg4ii> yeah
[4:01:21] <Dopamien> legit tired of games breaking meta now
[4:01:23] <+CourageTheCat> a Smell
[4:01:29] <Blank9> that sounds like what I think homestuck is
[4:01:30] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:01:31] <Pookiedaexzile> No Woolie don't invite that evil in this house
[4:01:33] <Tisaric> SourPls
[4:01:36] <%robosqueeb> there is a reasonable amount of meta allowed before it gets too pretentious
[4:01:40] <+Jiggisnipe> SourPls
[4:01:42] <dg4ii> yeah pretty close, except the vibecheck is 2009 programming humour
[4:01:43] <+cubbywolf> ?
[4:01:45] <Atomic_Blowfish> its the same kind of line in the sand that the podcast titles draw
[4:01:47] <%emptyantics> So Woolie calling it cringe core LUL
[4:01:58] <kinkade_77> it literally is cringe core
[4:02:02] <Atomic_Blowfish> "can you get past this? ok, you're in."
[4:02:10] <Tisaric> break it down into a turn based fight LUL
[4:02:17] <Yomamma1337> or just dont go left
[4:02:27] <ManfredA> it's the kind of energy of growing to be middle aged and realizing you actually like Shadow the Hedgehog unironically
[4:02:27] <Pookiedaexzile> Cringegore
[4:02:28] <BlackermanZX> fuck around and find out-core
[4:02:28] <nyacoo> play footsies with the notes
[4:02:31] <+cubbywolf> woolie is just thinking outloud
[4:02:35] <dg4ii> can you get past this? ok, can you get past THIS though? *half of fanbase leaves* ok but can you get past THIS?
[4:02:54] <brachydios777> Sup, caught up with the stream
[4:02:56] <+cubbywolf> yeah it seems you just gotta tank it good enuff

[4:03:44] <hassanico2> This is the finale?

[4:03:48] <MurseJOCO> GO BEYOND
[4:03:48] <ManfredA> I respect that energy
[4:03:53] <hassanico2> Or is there more before you can attack?
[4:04:00] <BlackermanZX> SourPls
[4:04:01] <jett_eyes> I like how this fight illustrates the process of making the game
[4:04:02] <+cubbywolf> AAAAAAH
[4:04:03] <kinkade_77> how

[4:06:05] <kinkade_77> is the damage sound the same as umdertale
[4:06:05] <CuttleCrow> I love how janky the everhood machine looks
[4:06:12] <Tisaric> he's getting better though PogChamp

[4:06:56] <velgaduere> I think this might be the coolest thing in the game tbh, and it's not even the "game" proper lmao
[4:06:57] <%derpumpkinking> its rough Woolz. those cuts through the blocks make doing this hitless a friggin nightmare
[4:07:01] <Pookiedaexzile> "No checkpoints is actally engaging the player"

[4:08:05] <$JobbedBone> etalPumpIt
[4:08:05] <ManfredA> @Pookiedaexzile it's fine to make your super hard optional content require completing the entire song
[4:08:08] <Tisaric> no he still has to kill
[4:08:10] <%emptyantics> @brachydios777 Yes
[4:08:14] <ManfredA> also you have to kill at the end
[4:08:23] <%emptyantics> Nvm
[4:08:26] <Pookiedaexzile> @Pookiedaexzile Why
[4:08:27] <%baronblank> yea, we haven't even gotten to the part where you can start actually killing
[4:08:27] <brachydios777> Well shit
[4:08:37] <$JobbedBone> are there any grabbable notes?
[4:08:37] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1490976552661979140?t=ZdiSmYj01DtZhJb8xco6Ig&s=19
[4:08:43] <+Jiggisnipe> imagine if this fight required a flashing lights warning too and had crazy distortion
[4:08:47] <dg4ii> @JobbedBone they have seen ONE grabbable note
[4:08:47] <%baronblank> @JobbedBone not yet
[4:08:48] <HR_Freud> feature not a bug
[4:08:55] <kinkade_77> this is that disco elysium game right

[4:09:20] <nolifegamin> Woolie's in the Infinite Tsukiyomi
[4:09:22] <%derpumpkinking> Like I said earlier. i consider this a four phase fight. they haven't even hit third phase where you can really start doing damage
[4:09:25] <@Menitta> there are Discos happening
[4:09:27] <CuttleCrow> well everytime you lose you gotta go through the whole everhood making of story LUL
[4:09:27] <$JobbedBone> TOTALLY INTERNALLY COHERENT
[4:09:32] <Pookiedaexzile> Weirdly enough "EverHood" would be a good name for Disco Elysium
[4:09:33] <$JobbedBone> YEAAAHHH
[4:09:37] <Tisaric> egghead is basically exactly the target audience for this game LUL
[4:10:29] <%emptyantics> You got this WOOLIE! woolieSPICE
[4:10:31] <$JobbedBone> oh god, please do not turn egghead into a twitch chatter
[4:10:47] <%derpumpkinking> I still dream of a Disco Elysium 2 trailer set to "Welcome to Jamrock"
[4:11:09] <kinkade_77> i hate playing jump rope in games so this would make me go insane
[4:11:15] <Pookiedaexzile> Cuno DLC when
[4:11:26] <Atomic_Blowfish> @derpumpkinking harry just gets really into ska instead of disco
[4:11:31] <%derpumpkinking> Cuno doesn't fucking care about DLC
[4:12:00] <%derpumpkinking> @atomic_blowfish LUL
[4:12:03] <Pookiedaexzile> Download Cuno
[4:12:07] <$JobbedBone> I really love the skill system in DE, but its heavily implied that its tied to who harry is as a person, so I have a feeling a game as someone other than him will do something else
[4:12:19] <+swymbiote> jordi's solo intro is the hardest part imo
[4:12:48] <%derpumpkinking> Oh I agree@jobbedbone . For DE2 to happen we need a different protag.
[4:12:54] <AppleBerryKitty> this just brings me back to playing a lot of ddr
[4:13:01] <+Mekhet09> what does the blue mean?
[4:13:06] <Aussie_Manny> lytWIFI
[4:13:12] <+Mekhet09> Is it also jump or can you move?
[4:13:18] <brachydios777> Devs laughing their ass off
[4:13:19] <+commoncurium> Reggie just wants to try
[4:13:36] <%arkv01> yo give microsoft edg-- I mean, reggie a chance
[4:13:39] <$JobbedBone> Kappa
[4:13:44] <+Fetrigon> absolutely
[4:13:52] <%Indigo_Automaton> Not for much longer wooliePOYO
[4:13:56] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> Devs:  "we win"
[4:13:58] <Pookiedaexzile> Not after the convo about the ending
[4:13:59] <brachydios777> Lil bit
[4:14:03] <+Jiggisnipe> Purple has a shit eating grin
[4:14:05] <Tisaric> oh yes these achievements get insane
[4:14:08] <@Menitta> Probably not laughing but rooting for the player
[4:14:08] <%emptyantics> I want to see these devs collab with the Hotline Miami devs
[4:14:16] <+swymbiote> the fight tells the story of the development of the game - purple on his own, he burns out, blue comes along and they do it together
[4:14:17] <@Menitta> but they did make a challenge
[4:14:17] <Tisaric> like multiple 1% achievements I think
[4:14:20] <%arkv01> is there an achievement for "refunded the game" LUL
[4:14:32] <%emptyantics> @swymbiote Its great
[4:14:58] <@Menitta> that's cool actually. didn't think of it like that @swymbiote
[4:14:58] <yomamma133713> Dev gnomes
[4:15:01] <%Indigo_Automaton> Dev Gnomes
[4:15:04] <%derpumpkinking> Look up hitless to hate yourself
[4:15:11] <%emptyantics> Dev Gnomes
[4:15:17] <Tisaric> like half of the achievements are 5% or under LUL
[4:15:26] <BlackermanZX> no hit videos are insane
[4:15:28] <+swymbiote> @Menitta after the purple one's first rush of notes he sort of 'explodes' and fades out, then the blue one takes over
[4:15:40] <jett_eyes> did they do the hallway
[4:15:40] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:15:40] <brachydios777> I would honestly love it if these devs get like a small cameo in Undertale or something
[4:15:50] <Atomic_Blowfish> @arkv01 microsoft edggie
[4:16:03] <+swymbiote> later in the fight while the notes are going, the blue one keeps dancing while the purple one rests as to not over exert
[4:16:03] <brachydios777> Sorry, deltarune
[4:16:05] <Tisaric> there's no hit achievements for every boss I think, on top of all the superboss stuff
[4:16:14] <%emptyantics> I have the same respect for the no hit SHUMP guys as I do for these no hit guys
[4:16:15] <skyshinecrusader> did woolie beat the game
[4:16:19] <%Indigo_Automaton> @brachydios777 Considering Deltarune is still far from done it's a possibility
[4:16:43] <hassanico2> Yo is that my boi Gelot
[4:16:44] <%Indigo_Automaton> Toby Fox seems like the kinda guy to support the people his games inspire
[4:16:46] <Tisaric> I hope Toby has been introduced to this game, you can tell the devs LOVE his games
[4:16:47] <brachydios777> @skyshinecrusader Fighting dev gnomes

[4:17:51] <hassanico2> Labbing*
[4:17:52] <Pookiedaexzile> Damn this remix slaps
[4:17:55] <jett_eyes> woolie's getting serious about this LUL LUL
[4:17:57] <Atomic_Blowfish> labbing a rhythm game
[4:17:58] <Pookiedaexzile> Chopped and screwed
[4:17:59] <+robertoszek> nice! I didn't know that shortcut, thanks Reggie!
[4:17:59] <Atomic_Blowfish> holy shit
[4:18:00] <%emptyantics> REMIX TIME
[4:18:09] <hassanico2> I always use Shift for that, it's so convenient
[4:18:09] <%derpumpkinking> DOWNLOAD THE SET
[4:18:15] <hassanico2> Then again I watch everything at 2x speed LUL
[4:18:29] <+Jiggisnipe> labbing is in Woolie's blood
[4:18:44] <$JobbedBone> just do it Kappa
[4:18:47] <brachydios777> Woolie is gonna know Kung Fu too
[4:18:52] <hassanico2> Woolie the labber stole my strats
[4:18:54] <CuttleCrow> gotta keep shuffling
[4:18:55] <Tisaric> yeah that's the right technique for the snake stuff, stay where it's most sparse
[4:19:08] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> even in slowmo this beat is sick
[4:19:17] <%Indigo_Automaton> @The_Forgotten_Alligator Right?
[4:19:26] <@Menitta> Aight I gotta go cook dinner for the fam. Have fun and good luck!
[4:19:39] <%Indigo_Automaton> I'd love to hear a properly cleaned up half speed version of this song
[4:19:43] <Wixvhen> Sometimes the trick is simply 'just be where the walls aren't'
[4:20:00] <$JobbedBone> awww thats cute
[4:20:30] <%emptyantics> Love how it‚Äôs telling the story of the cratiob of the game
[4:21:16] <ManfredA> this sounds like a PS1 twisted metal track
[4:21:27] <Pookiedaexzile> @ManfredA Yes
[4:21:29] <+Flarepulse> are we analyzing frame data
[4:21:33] <Daxalog> Oh wait
[4:21:47] <Daxalog> You actually have to defeat them
[4:21:48] <Wixvhen> Funny that this is the -half-way- point of the fight.
[4:21:58] <%DkLordG> Get Into Rhythm Games
[4:21:59] <Daxalog> Im questioning that is.
[4:22:00] <+swymbiote> the fight is significantly easier after you get this bit down
[4:22:18] <yomamma133713> You gonna check out hitless light alman?
[4:22:23] <%derpumpkinking> That was a sneaky chunk of damage for a hitless
[4:22:26] <yomamma133713> Lightman*
[4:22:30] <%derpumpkinking> this guy is ballsy
[4:22:30] <$JobbedBone> oh god
[4:22:37] <BlackermanZX> holy shit
[4:22:50] <Tisaric> yeah the people that get good at these games are fucking psychos
[4:22:50] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:22:54] <ManfredA> rhythm players are built different
[4:22:57] <%emptyantics> Fuck me
[4:22:57] <%Indigo_Automaton> INHUMAN POWER
[4:22:59] <$JobbedBone> ddr kid at the mall AngelThump
[4:23:08] <yomamma133713> Probably 4-5
[4:23:09] <+swymbiote> i believe this fight doesn't change patterns on story mode difficulty
[4:23:09] <CuttleCrow> years
[4:23:11] <jett_eyes> it's tough
[4:23:11] <+robertoszek> LUL
[4:23:12] <+Jiggisnipe> lol
[4:23:21] <Tisaric> like I got decent at stuff like GH and DDR but it's insane what the upper echelons are like
[4:23:25] <%derpumpkinking> Watch. next year someone is gonna play this game hitless on a banana.
[4:23:30] <%emptyantics> They‚Äôre real super saiyans
[4:23:30] <brachydios777> Built different
[4:23:36] <nolifegamin> yea whenever I see those ddr people kill it at the machines at the mall, I always think, "HOW!?"
[4:23:43] <CuttleCrow> probably able to do it blind
[4:23:51] <%Indigo_Automaton> @derpumpkinking Play it on a Guitar Hero controller LUL
[4:24:09] <Tisaric> legit this might be way easier if you could play it on a GH controller actually
[4:24:09] <VincentGraves> it's like how top tetris players are; they've built up skills for decades
[4:24:10] <+cubbywolf> use the drums from DK
[4:24:20] <brachydios777> @cubbywolf Bongos
[4:24:26] <Tisaric> if you have full control over the lane at all time it might actually be easier
[4:24:38] <%derpumpkinking> @indigo_automaton LUL thats what I mean.
[4:24:51] <+agumon9000> Sees the video stay to the left. >Goes to right
[4:24:56] <kinkade_77> The window is so small
[4:25:00] <+swymbiote> this game does use moonscraper for its charts, so theoretically...
[4:25:13] <VincentGraves> woolie just copy the moves of the video it's easy
[4:25:18] <brachydios777> This is legitimately Megalovania levels
[4:25:51] <Pookiedaexzile> Woolie just be freestyling
[4:26:02] <$JobbedBone> from the Ravage corner to the Fatal Markers? its not even REMOTELY POSSIBLE D:
[4:26:09] <kinkade_77> This looks way worse than the sans fight
[4:26:14] <brachydios777> See the code Woolie
[4:26:33] <glass_marcus> yea sans is comprehensible
[4:26:35] <+healnavi> That "shock" visual effect fucks with my ADHD just watching it. I don't think I could even reliably do this if I played it.
[4:26:55] <+swymbiote> this is harder than sans
[4:26:55] <%Jrockoni> imagine how unbearable this would be if the dong wasn't an absolute banger
[4:26:57] <%derpumpkinking> You gotta really nail those diagonals tbh.
[4:27:03] <+swymbiote> @Jrockoni banger dong
[4:27:10] <%Jrockoni> damn it all
[4:27:16] <yomamma133713> Column 3 not 4
[4:27:24] <+healnavi> that rapid flashing when the drum goes hard is insanely dostracting
[4:27:31] <+healnavi> *distracting
[4:28:07] <$Rafraud> Pause buffer it
[4:28:11] <brachydios777> For the love of god do not play this game if you  have risk to epilepsy
[4:28:11] <$JobbedBone> many notes, handle it jermaSun
[4:28:13] <+healnavi> ^
[4:28:34] <Pookiedaexzile> Why would you do your thing if that guy won
[4:28:45] <%derpumpkinking> Yeah bud you straight up conditioned yourself to the left side the whole game. gonna have to break the old habit.
[4:28:50] <Pookiedaexzile> Play a Top Tier Woolie
[4:29:16] <brachydios777> You think people will mod in bosses soon?
[4:29:19] <%Indigo_Automaton> YEYEYE
[4:29:27] <+swymbiote> @brachydios777 there are custom fights
[4:29:28] <Tisaric> @brachydios777 it's literally built into the game already
[4:29:35] <brachydios777> Nice
[4:29:42] <%Indigo_Automaton> @brachydios777 Yeah there basically already are
[4:29:52] <jett_eyes> @brachydios777 I thought that was already a thing
[4:29:52] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:29:55] <Tisaric> one of the devs made a sans fight since he knew someone would anyway at some point LUL
[4:30:10] <+swymbiote> double gnome time
[4:30:11] <brachydios777> @tisaric Hilarious
[4:30:18] <Pookiedaexzile> Pull the video up
[4:30:29] <yomamma133713> Just don't go to the left and you're good
[4:30:54] <%derpumpkinking> Seen some classical music customs actually, they are nucking futs.
[4:31:53] <%Indigo_Automaton> How appropriate that the dev fight would be the most buggy
[4:32:25] <+healnavi> I feel like what it's asking from the player is reasonable, but the presentation isn't.
[4:32:26] <yomamma133713> You did it correctly there, you were just slightly too slow
[4:32:56] <Tisaric> the presentation is the draw for the intended audience is the thing
[4:33:12] <Tisaric> like, these kind of distraction techniques are what rhythm game junkies crave
[4:33:15] <Sonny_Firestorm> wtf
[4:33:25] <AppleBerryKitty> lytJIVE
[4:33:37] <%derpumpkinking> I had to reset my game a few times thanks to leaky leaky times
[4:33:51] <+healnavi> Yeah, the flair is important. I think the types of distractions are the unreasonable bit.
[4:33:54] <%HeroToxiko> bunnnBop
[4:34:12] <$Rafraud> Why don't you catch some
[4:34:31] <kinkade_77> The part where the first troll starts spinning is wayy too fast to react
[4:34:36] <yomamma133713> I just stay in lane 2 there, less dps but way easier
[4:34:52] <%Indigo_Automaton> Nah it's cool
[4:34:55] <+healnavi> It's not you, don't worry
[4:34:56] <AppleBerryKitty> we like the music
[4:34:57] <+Jiggisnipe> it's cool
[4:34:58] <+commoncurium> I fucking love this
[4:35:04] <kinkade_77> It‚Äôs fun
[4:35:05] <+Jiggisnipe> this is a challenge
[4:35:08] <Pookiedaexzile> We Won't Riot if you Play Sifu instead
[4:35:09] <jett_eyes> poison? this is fun!
[4:35:11] <+commoncurium> Lab work is good work
[4:35:11] <%emptyantics> Its a challenge lol
[4:35:14] <brachydios777> It‚Äôs fine, it‚Äôs hard
[4:35:14] <CuttleCrow> this is great AND theres good music
[4:35:15] <Dopamien> I watch speed runners lab all the time, down time isnt a problem for me
[4:35:22] <AppleBerryKitty> pretty what MAX does for 4 hours
[4:35:35] <+Jiggisnipe> also that's the point of the stream, we get to see how an lp comes together
[4:35:42] <%andrewofbob> Get Into Rhythm Games - woolieGLORY
[4:36:03] <%cobalt_phoenix_> i def don't speak for everyone, but i kinda wish in old lps like souls ones there were never any cuts between boss runs even if it's kinda silent
[4:36:07] <%cobalt_phoenix_> so this is nice
[4:37:09] <Tisaric> I feel like most of what these top players are doing is reacting but yeah it's hard as shit
[4:37:09] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1490976552661979140?t=ZdiSmYj01DtZhJb8xco6Ig&s=19
[4:37:28] <Tisaric> they know the basic gist but rely on reactions
[4:37:39] <%derpumpkinking> @tisaric Yep.
[4:37:41] <CuttleCrow> pure memorization
[4:37:42] <Blank9> I like seeing research and strategy
[4:37:46] <brachydios777> This fight is really trolly
[4:37:48] <yomamma133713> You don't need to maximize damage here
[4:37:52] <PizzicatoFive5> just keep your eyes at the top of the playzone
[4:37:59] <Blank9> always fun to just roll the footage and make a plan
[4:38:03] <%derpumpkinking> Once you can recognize the pattern its all just hitting the right buttons
[4:38:27] <yomamma133713> If you think this strat is too hard, you can watch a different clear
[4:38:30] <%derpumpkinking> Also pay no attention to him sneaking in this damage. thats honestly him clearing lanes.
[4:38:55] <+happyfaceman> 5 5 4 4 2 3 zig zag

[4:39:23] <brachydios777> Left is killer there
[4:39:26] <%derpumpkinking> Also remember this is still MORE to the fight.
[4:39:26] <+happyfaceman> If bald dwarf can do FF14 raids. You can do this
[4:39:29] <+happyfaceman> I believe in you woolie
[4:39:30] <+swymbiote> after fighting through light being i got better at attacking than jumping
[4:39:33] <%emptyantics> Damn I don‚Äôt remember it being this difficult when I beat it
[4:39:38] <AppleBerryKitty> dont think too hard about it
[4:39:40] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[4:39:40] <BlackermanZX> this fight is pure insanity
[4:39:45] <dg4ii> @derpumpkinking it's just this one section repeating
[4:39:45] <QueequegTheater> @happyfaceman Only Extreme though Kappa
[4:39:57] <$Rafraud> COWARD
[4:39:59] <$Rafraud> Kappa
[4:40:04] <%jinking79> mental damage at a medium
[4:40:25] <%derpumpkinking> @dg4ii For woolie though hes gonna have difficulty keeping up the dps for the loop.
[4:40:26] <%emptyantics> [Woolie at RISK]
[4:40:43] <brachydios777> Woolie is gonna here this song in his dreams
[4:40:48] <brachydios777> *hear
[4:40:51] <PizzicatoFive5> that look on his face man
[4:41:21] <+robertoszek> gotta find those Gnome plushies, Reggie!
[4:41:47] <PizzicatoFive5> keep your eyes close to the higher end of the playzone
[4:42:15] <Yomamma1337> you move over right after the notes that block you from moving over
[4:42:20] <+DreyfussFrost> @happyfaceman But he doesn't LUL
[4:42:29] <+happyfaceman> I would love to see Woolie try Drakengard endings
[4:42:34] <+happyfaceman> those are some real rhythm games
[4:42:43] <%emptyantics> Just do what the no hit video does Kappa
[4:42:57] <AppleBerryKitty> unlike thumper you can see whats coming to you from a far, this game it's soooo upclose you're not fast enough to react.
[4:43:18] <%derpumpkinking> Idk man. I respect you a lot Woolz but this is not easy. Im afraid eventually you'll get stuck in an infinite loop of just dodging to stay alive without putting in damage.
[4:43:38] <+swymbiote> @derpumpkinking you don't need to do damage during the second rush, he will not get stuck there
[4:43:48] <QueequegTheater> WHY IS THAT LAST ONE SO LONG
[4:43:50] <PizzicatoFive5> is this like an extra fight or something?
[4:43:52] <+happyfaceman> This doesn't seem that bad after staring at it
[4:44:00] <CuttleCrow> superboss bonus fight
[4:44:01] <+happyfaceman> I believe in woolie
[4:44:19] <+maria_luke> @pizzicatofive5 super boss. optional.
[4:44:19] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:44:30] <+levvix9> is this the lsd game?
[4:44:38] <QueequegTheater> yes
[4:45:04] <%emptyantics> Goddamn
[4:45:11] <+Fabpsi_> you shouldn't play this game when you already use lsd, bad ida
[4:46:16] <+Fabpsi_> go woolie go woolie go!
[4:46:25] <+levvix9> wow 5 hours of this?
[4:46:33] <AppleBerryKitty> i just hope hes havin fun

[4:49:48] <%derpumpkinking> Fuck. I would love some DKC right now
[4:49:49] <Pookiedaexzile> Is it really worth it?
[4:49:55] <+swymbiote> can just lower difficulty
[4:50:02] <CuttleCrow> try the other boss?
[4:50:09] <QueequegTheater> @swymbiote Only story difficulty would change the pattern
[4:50:09] <+swymbiote> the other boss is also an option ye
[4:50:13] <+theoldone001> Woolie it's OK, you don't have to beat it.
[4:50:21] <%derpumpkinking> Yeah. Story isnt gonna help here
[4:50:23] <+swymbiote> @swymbiote story difficulty doesn't change the pattern for this fight but having more health gets you through more patterns
[4:50:28] <+swymbiote> faster regen
[4:50:30] <+Fabpsi_> yea, when you get into the too much trying zone. it needs to come a little bit natural.  You can do this, i have no doubt, just atm it is hitting a frustrating level
[4:50:31] <Tisaric> tbf even on easier difficulty you have way more health and regen
[4:50:33] <%livlinn> !uptime
[4:50:33] <@Moobot> @livlinn WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 5 hours and 13 minutes
[4:50:33] <CuttleCrow> dev gnomes are painfully hard

[4:51:00] <%OrangeMDT> Woolie will figure it out‚Ä¶ but not today woolieDATTEBAYO
[4:51:02] <%derpumpkinking> Yeah but failing on story at all feels bad.

[5:00:34] <QueequegTheater> Just dodge 4Head
[5:00:35] <+vaderxyz1970> is this even fun anymore
[5:00:48] <+Fabpsi_> numbers, pauses, numbers, jump, walls, excitement?
[5:00:48] <+Demoli_PT> @WoolieVersus @reggie pi and euler aren't irrational, they are real numbers
[5:00:49] <Pookiedaexzile> You think this is about fun
[5:00:52] <stevenellis386> it reminds me of a musician reading and studying music notes of a song.
[5:00:53] <BreakfastSampler> @vaderxyz1970 only catharsis
[5:00:56] <jellssssss20> Oh boy this is the fight where I turned it to the easiest difficulty and still only completed it by beating the song, not the lifebar

[5:02:42] <BreakfastSampler> @andrewofbob you don't, it's just a lot to avoid
[5:02:43] <+swymbiote> you don't have to dps
[5:02:47] <+swymbiote> you just have to eventually kill
[5:02:47] <Dopamien> SourPls zig zag zigzagzig SourPls
[5:02:48] <Pookiedaexzile> WHAT YOU MEAN IT LOOPS
[5:02:49] <T_Sasquatch> Hmm i see (doesn't understand at all)
[5:02:51] <brachydios777> It loops?
[5:02:51] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> monkaS he's turning into a machine
[5:02:53] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[5:02:54] <+Fabpsi_> 2 sec!
[5:02:55] <+maria_luke> 55454-2A-3A-4A-(LZ)(RZ)(LZ)3J
[5:02:55] <DancesWitBalrog> kinda danki ngl
[5:02:56] <%emptyantics> Only way to end is to kill
[5:03:03] <+swymbiote> you can't 'spare' them
[5:03:03] <BlackermanZX> it loops but it loops on the insane zig zag
[5:03:04] <%emptyantics> 55454-2A-3A-4A-(LZ)(RZ)(LZ)3J
[5:03:05] <Pookiedaexzile> Fuck this game
[5:03:11] <stevenellis386> commit until iys muscle memory @WoolieVersus
[5:03:21] <skyshinecrusader> Does woolie know you must kill them?
[5:03:25] <brachydios777> This game is literally asking you to git gud
[5:03:26] <PizzicatoFive5> are Woolie and Reggie in the same room?
[5:03:26] <AppleBerryKitty> a true gamer
[5:03:31] <jellssssss20> Maybe if you actually use a fightstick
[5:03:36] <QueequegTheater> @PizzicatoFive5 Reggie isn't real
[5:03:37] <+vaderxyz1970> BABA is you
[5:03:38] <+swymbiote> you don't have to kill them during the insane part, there's another part afterwards they haven't seen yet
[5:03:38] <%robosqueeb> We're having fun right?....right?
[5:03:46] <QueequegTheater> but if baba ceases to be
[5:03:48] <Dopamien> FeelsBadMan üî´ it loops
[5:03:49] <HotSauceFiend> lol will switching to a arcade fight stick help with dodging i wonder
[5:03:51] <+swymbiote> when i did this, i don't think i did any damage during the insane part at all
[5:03:52] <+Fabpsi_> woolie is an honest gamer, love watching the learning and trying
[5:03:59] <+capybruhArt> whenever i think about labbing a game this hard i always ask myself if i should just be relearning piano
[5:03:59] <Aussie_Manny> lytJIVE lytJIVE lytJIVE lytJIVE lytJIVE lytJIVE lytJIVE lytJIVE lytJIVE
[5:04:03] <gespenstkick> I've reached that point where the words "four" and "five" have lost their meaning
[5:04:03] <jellssssss20> The background is the story of this game being made
[5:04:08] <+ghostfaceninja_> bro...
[5:04:08] <+Fabpsi_> more than 2 seconds!
[5:04:11] <%LastHazzerd> longer than 2 seconds!
[5:04:14] <Aussie_Manny> FUCK
[5:04:34] <jellssssss20> you have to side hop those
[5:04:35] <%emptyantics> Its alright you got this!
[5:04:46] <+Fabpsi_> now the "let's get back to the boss"-run that is  on its own a very personal hell
[5:04:53] <BlackermanZX> for real even in story mode this song is insane
[5:04:56] <jellssssss20> It has i-frames for some reason
[5:05:01] <HotSauceFiend> (has woolie gotten to the...other ng+ fight?
[5:05:09] <NewDonkKing> yes
[5:05:11] <+swymbiote> they met sam but didn't go through his door yet
[5:05:12] <NewDonkKing> once
[5:05:13] <brachydios777> I feel like you should get a reward like slow mo or something for beating this
[5:05:18] <+Maleicus> he took a peek
[5:05:22] <%emptyantics> Elden Ring will fee like a joke thanks to this game
[5:05:23] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1490976552661979140?t=ZdiSmYj01DtZhJb8xco6Ig&s=19
[5:05:27] <gespenstkick> I see that mashing
[5:05:29] <QueequegTheater> @brachydios777 This is like the third hardest fight
[5:05:39] <+swymbiote> this was the hardest for me
[5:05:43] <brachydios777> @queequegtheater What‚Äôs the hardest!?
[5:05:45] <+vaderxyz1970> @emptyantics Elden Ring will feel fair
[5:05:49] <+Fabpsi_> you should get a 30 day free trial of herion or a doctor
[5:05:49] <+swymbiote> killing the cat is harder but you don't have to
[5:05:55] <QueequegTheater> @brachydios777 There's a reason he left the cat alone
[5:06:00] <jellssssss20> This is one of two fights where the note lanes don't change
[5:06:03] <+maria_luke> @emptyantics idk I feel like that's comparing an apple to an orange?
[5:06:05] <BlackermanZX> truly this is the dark souls of rhythm games Keepo
[5:06:06] <brachydios777> Elden ring will be a walk in a park afterwards
[5:06:27] <+Jiggisnipe> feel the beat
[5:06:28] <+Fabpsi_> reggie with the babbabababaab assists!
[5:07:05] <%polothegreatest> This feels like you play hard on GH one song and decided, nah expert only run LUL

[5:08:01] <%arkv01> gg PunOko
[5:08:01] <kinkade_77> no way lol
[5:08:02] <+Fabpsi_> dude....DUDE....
[5:08:02] <HotSauceFiend> UNTIL IT IS DONE
[5:08:02] <+Jiggisnipe> it was hype when he got there tho
[5:08:02] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> yes
[5:08:03] <+maria_luke> yes
[5:08:05] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> and now we look up the ending on youtube :)
[5:08:06] <BlackermanZX> ITS HORRIBLE

[5:08:12] <%derpumpkinking> Went and made a meatball sub we still on Devs?
[5:08:13] <%LastHazzerd> it never ends in everhood
[5:08:14] <gespenstkick> SQUARE UP
[5:08:15] <%livlinn> woolieDATTEBAYO woolieOMG woolieDATTEBAYO
[5:08:18] <+maria_luke> here take it again 55454-2A-3A-4A-(LZ)(RZ)(LZ)3J
[5:08:22] <%baronblank> this is why I switched to story mode on this fight specifically
[5:08:24] <%emptyantics> DEV GOT HANDS
[5:08:24] <+za7az> Story mode time?
[5:08:26] <skyshinecrusader> can you just start shooting them earlier?
[5:08:27] <Saltmeisterr> @derpumpkinking we reached the loop
[5:08:28] <brachydios777> Devs do be going ‚Äú GIT FUCKING GOOD‚Äù
[5:08:31] <Aussie_Manny> progress made
[5:08:31] <%polothegreatest> Through the fires and flames woolieGASM
[5:08:33] <VincentGraves> just getting into the ring is horrible
[5:08:36] <ManfredA> all story mode does is give them 60 hp
[5:08:41] <+Fabpsi_> it is not the push, it is the loop
[5:08:41] <HotSauceFiend> At least Catboss has some fun stuff after, this is a pain honestly
[5:08:43] <jellssssss20> well shit i was thinking of the other fight
[5:08:43] <ManfredA> still gotta do it
[5:08:43] <+Fabpsi_> the push loop
[5:08:45] <CuttleCrow> this isn't some mario kart ghost
[5:08:45] <+vaderxyz1970> A man has been broken
[5:08:54] <%derpumpkinking> @saltmeisterr Oh! Good job Woolz.
[5:09:00] <+Fabpsi_> man accepting being a normal human
[5:09:00] <nyacoo> Easy mode?
[5:09:02] <$Rafraud> Know your limits lol
[5:09:05] <+Fabpsi_> still very nice tries
[5:09:07] <+swymbiote> the point of changing the difficulty for this fight is to give you more health and regen
[5:09:07] <%baronblank> story mode gives them low health, gives you high health, makes it far more manageable
[5:09:09] <+Fabpsi_> proud of you
[5:09:12] <%derpumpkinking> HA!
[5:09:15] <HotSauceFiend> He doesnt drop the difficulty, but claims its impossible
[5:09:15] <VincentGraves> there is absolutely no shame
[5:09:18] <brachydios777> Maybe turning down the difficulty?
[5:09:19] <gespenstkick> You're gonna dream of this song man
[5:09:21] <skyshinecrusader> Well watch the video at least no shame

[5:09:25] <%emptyantics> Eyes on the inside for this fight
[5:09:27] <+healnavi> This reminds me of something HideofBeast once said. "if it's not conceivable that a person could clear your stage in one try, no matter how unlikely, your stage is shit"
[5:09:28] <BlackermanZX> story modes feels like normal mode
[5:09:29] <+Fabpsi_> No shame, just keeping it real
[5:09:37] <CuttleCrow> yeee
[5:09:39] <%derpumpkinking> I told ya guys. i have the utmost respect for you Woolz but its nuts as hell.
[5:09:39] <+Jiggisnipe> yea
[5:09:42] <+robertoszek> attaboy
[5:09:42] <%baronblank> easy is also good yea
[5:09:46] <+swymbiote> yeah
[5:09:47] <gespenstkick> Easy mode has been unlocked
[5:09:48] <mikash91> halleluyah
[5:09:49] <%baronblank> super reasonable
[5:09:49] <%HeroToxiko> Easy mode is now selectible PogBones
[5:09:50] <kinkade_77> wait who is insane mode for
[5:09:51] <ManfredA> @healnavi people can and do nail this kind of thing in 1-3 tries
[5:09:51] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> easy mode has been unlocked
[5:09:54] <DancesWitBalrog> is it time to get call in REDACTED?
[5:09:56] <CuttleCrow> woolieFUN
[5:10:01] <Aussie_Manny> i'm curious to see the difference
[5:10:02] <+Jiggisnipe> it's still the same pattern right?
[5:10:02] <+swymbiote> @kinkade_77 insane mode is for when you're trying for the no-hit achievements
[5:10:03] <Yomamma1337> @WoolieVersus theres a much easier route than the one in the video fyi, just does less dps
[5:10:03] <+Fabpsi_> insane mode is for the real fun
[5:10:13] <PizzicatoFive5> @healnavi to be fair, it's an optional boss fight
[5:10:14] <+swymbiote> they have more health and regen now
[5:10:18] <%robosqueeb> This game does not have a fun hard mode I'm learning
[5:10:28] <gespenstkick> Oh no, it's different now LUL
[5:10:30] <+Fabpsi_> unless you love pain
[5:10:32] <+healnavi> @manfreda It's not meant to be taken 100% literally, dingus. LUL
[5:10:33] <+Fabpsi_> like. real pain
[5:10:39] <Yomamma1337> @robosqueeb it is if you like hard games
[5:10:46] <%derpumpkinking> time to learn the new pattern
[5:10:46] <ManfredA> then what is the actual point of the statement
[5:10:55] <+swymbiote> like all games, you use hard mode if you're very good and tailor it to your taste
[5:10:58] <+healnavi> the "reasonable" part
[5:11:01] <%baronblank> yep
[5:11:01] <+swymbiote> that's why difficulty options are good
[5:11:05] <VincentGraves> I feel this challenge is meant for people for deft hands
[5:11:07] <CuttleCrow> their HP and you regen much faster
[5:11:09] <HotSauceFiend> and the regen is faster
[5:11:10] <+healnavi> it's not "is it literally impossible"
[5:11:12] <BlackermanZX> just the hp and regen
[5:11:18] <gespenstkick> oH, i THOUGHT IT CHANGED
[5:11:26] <+Jiggisnipe> more leeway
[5:11:28] <+Fabpsi_> no, stays the same
[5:11:30] <CuttleCrow> you still gotta do it
[5:11:31] <+swymbiote> story mode changes almost all fights but not this one
[5:11:34] <T_Sasquatch> my brain fries while playing ikaruga so hearing woolie complain is hilarious
[5:11:37] <+DreyfussFrost> On easy you have 5 HP instead of 3 and faster regen, and boss HP is lower on each difficulty. Story mode gives you 7 HP.
[5:11:41] <%HeroToxiko> less of the guitar hero downgrade effect is pretty cool
[5:11:43] <Saltmeisterr> wut LUL
[5:11:52] <%derpumpkinking> There is only ONE impossible fight/encounter in the game.
[5:11:53] <gespenstkick> Oof
[5:12:00] <+Fabpsi_> tbf story mode is fine too
[5:12:03] <Saltmeisterr> woolie i play celeste and i have no idea what you mean lol
[5:12:05] <+Fabpsi_> nobody gonna judge now
[5:12:10] <+swymbiote> story mode is a shame for the rest because you lose portions of the songs
[5:12:10] <brachydios777> Cuphead looks like Mario compared to this

[5:12:44] <%HeroToxiko> SourPls
[5:12:48] <+vaderxyz1970> @brachydios777  cock and ball torture looks like fun compared to this
[5:13:05] <%OrangeMDT> This is the dark souls of rhythm woolieSPICE
[5:13:11] <Saltmeisterr> tbh cuphead is like the perfect difficulty for me
[5:13:25] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> this is the Undertale of Dark Souls
[5:13:28] <brachydios777> @vaderxyz1970 Like cock and ball torture without the cock and balls
[5:13:39] <PizzicatoFive5> except with bad music
[5:13:53] <Saltmeisterr> @brachydios777 i love that Gianni vid lol
[5:14:00] <Aussie_Manny> üëà üëà üëâ üëâ üëà üëà üëâ üëâ
[5:14:06] <%derpumpkinking> I think Blaphemous has perfect difficulty. Never found one thing in the game I found unfair even after dlcs
[5:14:13] <gespenstkick> Temper your rage Domon, achieve the serene hand
[5:14:14] <Yomamma1337> lane 2 barely has any walls
[5:14:15] <BlackermanZX> this game is the nightmare of a kotaku reviewer
[5:14:23] <%derpumpkinking> Blasphemous* fml
[5:14:26] <%HeroToxiko> which song is this
[5:14:37] <Saltmeisterr> @derpumpkinking ngl the dlc boss fights look fun af
[5:14:42] <jett_eyes> sounds like the song is fuckin up
[5:14:44] <Yomamma1337> @BlackermanZX its both a rhythm game AND a bullet hell, its like mixing 2 masochistic genres
[5:14:48] <brachydios777> This would make a ign reviewer have an existential crisis
[5:14:50] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> born to shit but forced to wipe: the battle sequence
[5:15:00] <BreakfastSampler> lololollllgamereviewersamirite take my updoot
[5:15:02] <%derpumpkinking> @saltmeisterr They REALLY are.
[5:15:11] <+vaderxyz1970> @blackermanzx silly gamer, game jurnalists don't have dreams
[5:15:18] <ManfredA> a rhythm game is just an on rails bullet hell
[5:15:20] <ManfredA> change my mind
[5:15:23] <gespenstkick> !Salt at risk!
[5:15:30] <DancesWitBalrog> why are we here? just to suffer?
[5:15:33] <anarchistPastry> this whole game feels like that
[5:15:36] <%HeroToxiko> nah thats just edm @jett_eyes
[5:15:38] <penitentpendant> "What was the recommended dosage level of this game again?"
[5:15:40] <nyacoo> The game warned you of seizures, it didn't warn you of the mental damage
[5:15:42] <%emptyantics> Woolie: BROKEN
[5:15:43] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> this track will play from within Woolie's walls as he goes to bed at night
[5:15:46] <+Flarepulse> 72 (Everhood mix), aka nOISE gATE by KITCALIBER @herotoxiko
[5:15:52] <Yomamma1337> @ManfredA in a rhythm game youre not piloting anything either, unlike this game
[5:15:56] <%HeroToxiko> @Flarepulse thanks
[5:16:00] <%derpumpkinking> Did Woolz ever do Path of Pain in HK?
[5:16:09] <Pookiedaexzile> "2 Qubecers get fucked by Foreign Djs"
[5:16:14] <PizzicatoFive5> alright come on Woolsworth
[5:16:15] <ManfredA> I meant what I said before either way
[5:16:18] <+kewlmyc> I just got back. Holy shit, this seems insane
[5:16:18] <%LastHazzerd> what's everhood programmed in?
[5:16:20] <ManfredA> rhythm gamers are built different
[5:16:25] <jett_eyes> ah damn
[5:16:26] <PizzicatoFive5> Audacity
[5:16:31] <+Flarepulse> this and the sun battle have a weird music history
[5:16:34] <mexicansunglasses> @LastHazzerd Tilt Software
[5:16:36] <+maria_luke> I can feel my fingers and my wrists. The controllers ive lost, the keyboards ive lost wont stop hurting...
[5:16:38] <+vaderxyz1970> @lasthazzerd Poney Island
[5:16:38] <%LastHazzerd> @pizzicatofive5 LUL
[5:16:41] <BlackermanZX> buy this game to make a game journo shit his pants
[5:16:44] <+PunkMcFox> @LastHazzerd Unity I believe
[5:16:51] <gespenstkick> Les gooo
[5:17:00] <+maria_luke> you can feel it too, don't you?
[5:17:03] <%LastHazzerd> makes sense, with the screen shots i was seeing from blue over there
[5:17:09] <%emptyantics> you can feel it too, don‚Äôt you?
[5:17:12] <Aussie_Manny> brodayMeltdown brodayMeltdown brodayMeltdown brodayMeltdown brodayMeltdown
[5:17:19] <+ghostfaceninja_> fucking insane
[5:17:34] <brachydios777> Christ
[5:17:37] <%polothegreatest> Path. Of pain wasnt that risky cuz u dont lose anything doodBait
[5:17:38] <+kewlmyc> Woolie seems defeated. :(
[5:17:48] <Sonny_Firestorm> Thinking about it, I guess a jornalist who can consistently play insane games is a lot to ask, huh?
[5:18:10] <+MosesUnspoken> dodging against the rhythm seems tough
[5:18:24] <brachydios777> @sonny_firestorm Is getting through a tutorial too much to ask?
[5:18:26] <randomahole> bruh, I was gone for 2 hours and he's still here. Is he still on hard?
[5:18:29] <Dopamien> @polothegreatest what do you lose here?
[5:18:31] <%Jrockoni> this boss fight slowly making woolie go from wanting to shake the devs hands to punch them.
[5:18:34] <Yomamma1337> @randomahole hes on easy lmao
[5:18:35] <Pookiedaexzile> If this shit Loops Its a wrap
[5:18:40] <%emptyantics> DATEBAYO WOOLIE
[5:18:44] <Aussie_Manny> Make the game slower, you assholes!
[5:18:48] <+vaderxyz1970> @dopamien ego
[5:18:58] <+PunkMcFox> This boss is nuts. The struggle was real
[5:19:06] <Aussie_Manny> Oh no, it's gone gold! D:
[5:19:08] <PizzicatoFive5> tap your foot to the rhythm
[5:19:11] <penitentpendant> It's nice you can pause midfight
[5:19:13] <gespenstkick> Aw shiet, here we go again
[5:19:15] <Sonny_Firestorm> @brachydios777 Oh no, I'm still gonna continue to dunk on guys like the "sekiro needs an easy mode" ones, I just mean like in general.
[5:19:18] <+kewlmyc> You can do it Woolz!
[5:19:19] <Emerald_Emperor> jesus is woolie ok
[5:19:21] <%LastHazzerd> i like how purple comes in to occasionally work on the technical parts but is mostly there for the music
[5:19:23] <Pistofficer> woolie looks pissed hahah
[5:19:24] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts

[5:19:28] <bippityjones> (Woolie entering his dance mind-palace)
[5:19:32] <+maria_luke> @sonny_firestorm I'd rather have a journalist admit they can't do difficult but would give it a fair review than a journalist who doesn't and drags the game.
[5:19:32] <QueequegTheater> ! WOOLIE AT RISK !
[5:19:34] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> game really said go home and be a family man
[5:19:38] <Pookiedaexzile> No
[5:19:45] <%emptyantics> [We answer when we are called]
[5:19:50] <+Flarepulse> Woolie is desperate to murder these developers
[5:19:59] <brachydios777> @sonny_firestorm Yes sir
[5:20:10] <dg4ii> shit
[5:20:10] <HotSauceFiend> STROY MODE
[5:20:11] <Aussie_Manny> DAMN
[5:20:13] <Pistofficer> this is INSANE
[5:20:13] <+healnavi> @sonny_firestorm Games don't need easy modes, but the baseline for completion should be within the realm of reason, even if it's hard (like Miyazaki games)
[5:20:17] <BlackermanZX> yeah do story mode LUL
[5:20:20] <+MosesUnspoken> You know you wanna
[5:20:24] <PizzicatoFive5> watch the video on 2x speed and then come back to this, it'll be like kicking baby
[5:20:26] <Yomamma1337> that last note is legit the hardest part of the song
[5:20:27] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> TEAM FROG TEAM FROG TEAM FROG
[5:20:29] <CommandantKobold> I believe in you Woolz :)
[5:20:31] <Aussie_Manny> At least it appears there's no more surprises with this fight. (knock on wood)
[5:20:32] <%polothegreatest> Here? Nothing but im gaining knowledge. Game seems fun ngl doodNuts
[5:20:33] <dg4ii> story mode isn't different from easy is it?
[5:20:37] <brachydios777> I fear for the devs if they ever meet Woolie irl
[5:20:39] <ManfredA> I feel that it's okay for some games to not be completable by everyone or even most people
[5:20:39] <bippityjones> I'm seeing this man flash red
[5:20:46] <Yomamma1337> @dg4ii pretty sure it is
[5:20:50] <dg4ii> for this fight specifically
[5:20:52] <+vaderxyz1970> can a game make you hate the developers as a person
[5:20:57] <+healnavi> @bippityjones he moves 3x faster if he's red
[5:20:57] <dg4ii> i know it changes charting in some fights
[5:21:02] <HotSauceFiend> Reggie being the npc trainer in the background saying" It's XP its XP
[5:21:02] <ManfredA> I realized that I could only get so far in IWBTG but I still appreciate it
[5:21:02] <jett_eyes> going any lower than normal makes the battle have less projectiles, right?
[5:21:04] <%emptyantics> [WOOLIE AT RISK!]
[5:21:06] <%polothegreatest> Reverse GH feels weird
[5:21:11] <Yomamma1337> @dg4ii iirc two fights dont change, including frog.  dont know about this one
[5:21:20] <%Jrockoni> woolie spite following them on Twitter as soon as this sessions done.
[5:21:20] <skyshinecrusader> woolie CAN do it just like any normal person will take a while
[5:21:21] <QueequegTheater> God, Reggie is just a bottomless fountain of optimism
[5:21:22] <+healnavi> @manfreda I agree with that.
[5:21:28] <gespenstkick> Salt reflexes
[5:21:33] <%emptyantics> @jett_eyes No it gives the boss less hp and it give you more hp
[5:21:35] <ManfredA> Dev Gnomes and Frog's Wrath are both the same charts on all difficulties
[5:21:43] <+kewlmyc> Is this a secret hard boss, or is the game just normally this insane?
[5:21:45] <dg4ii> depends on how much of the developer is in the game. YIIK definitely makes you hate *someone*
[5:21:47] <ManfredA> but it would at least soften mistakes
[5:21:47] <stevenellis386> whats the name of this track, chat?
[5:21:47] <Dopamien> I wish I had a reggie to cheer me on FeelsBadMan
[5:21:49] <+Jiggisnipe> Different games do different things. Some will be challenging, some will demand perfection, some are easier and allow mistakes. Nothing wrong with either design decision
[5:21:50] <jett_eyes> ah, I see
[5:21:51] <DancesWitBalrog> Woolie gonna remember this like Fume Knight
[5:21:52] <dg4ii> @kewlmyc secret hard boss
[5:21:53] <%Zero_Jacks> kinda wish the game didnt want to  blind you, if it didnt do that id play it
[5:21:53] <+maria_luke> @vaderxyz1970 there was that one... VN(?) game made by a pickup artist that fits the bill nicely.
[5:22:00] <BlackermanZX> game is normally insane but this is brutal
[5:22:04] <PizzicatoFive5> Reggie is just Woolie's teenage projection that keeps him from touching bottom
[5:22:05] <Aussie_Manny> lytKEK lytKEK
[5:22:06] <bippityjones> @healnavi He's taken the sunglasses off

[5:22:18] <jett_eyes> I keep forgetting which fights werent effected by the difficulty
[5:22:29] <Aussie_Manny> nice jumps!
[5:22:34] <dg4ii> @Zero_Jacks you can turn off flashing lights in the options

[5:22:43] <+healnavi> @bippityjones Woolie Bajeena
[5:22:43] <+PunkMcFox> And crazy dudes out there can do no hit runs of this lol
[5:22:50] <KaiserMario> I'd rather fight Magaki on the hardest difficulty with an all grappler team
[5:22:53] <Sonny_Firestorm> If I met the guys who made this, I'd probably call the narcs cause they high. LUL

[5:23:10] <Champstice> Had to tune out a while, he beat light guy and/or cat?
[5:23:13] <brachydios777> @dg4ii Well, here you don‚Äôt hate the devs for being too pretentious
[5:23:18] <dg4ii> I think it detracts from several moments like the sun battle being lamer, but if someone needs it then someone needs it
[5:23:22] <+swymbiote> @Champstice beat light guy to unlock this, looked at cat once
[5:23:22] <+Jiggisnipe> see that's a problem
[5:23:23] <stevenellis386> thanks @swymbiote
[5:23:26] <QueequegTheater> LUL
[5:23:27] <+healnavi> yeah that's kinda fucked
[5:23:30] <Aussie_Manny> It's dropping frames?? Oh christ...
[5:23:32] <+vaderxyz1970> oooffffff
[5:23:34] <ManfredA> you guys should really see the kind of shit actually crazy rhythm games expect you to do
[5:23:35] <+Jiggisnipe> your game needs to run and smooth and/or consistent
[5:23:36] <AppleBerryKitty> they need to fix that, that will kill runs
[5:23:41] <%Zero_Jacks> @Zero_Jacks lytSNEER Nice
[5:23:47] <Yomamma1337> you can just stand in the middle for the zigzag
[5:23:50] <+MosesUnspoken> You got this, man
[5:23:57] <%livlinn> Oof close
[5:24:00] <NewDonkKing> reset game?
[5:24:03] <Tisaric> yeah it's really dissapointing they haven't fully quashed all the frame skipping issues on these superbosses
[5:24:07] <gespenstkick> It really bothers me that their hand animations don't align with the barrage of bullets LUL
[5:24:09] <randomahole> could reset to improve frame drops, if it's a memory leak issue
[5:24:09] <+healnavi> @manfreda I feel like BeatMani is more reasonable. :V
[5:24:20] <+PunkMcFox> Yeah you're game needs to run flawless if you need to play flawless.
[5:24:24] <jett_eyes> [WOOLIE DAMAGED]
[5:24:32] <Tisaric> like I can't blame them since it's not easy at all to debug memory issues but it's such a huge problem
[5:24:34] <Yomamma1337> definitely seems like its a problem with your pc, this hasnt happened to me
[5:24:35] <%andrewofbob> @ManfredA The AGDQ Stepmania showcase is a nice demonstration of the kind of bullshit the modders get up to
[5:24:37] <+swymbiote> i mean they're presumably recording + streaming at the same time
[5:24:39] <+healnavi> delay CRINGE
[5:24:40] <+swymbiote> i never had any framedrops
[5:24:41] <HotSauceFiend> does Everhood need Rollback?
[5:24:41] <%emptyantics> [WOOLIE AT RISK!]
[5:24:45] <DreiDD> REggie LUL
[5:24:46] <%atlasdotwav> How long can you move within the dropped frames
[5:24:57] <jett_eyes> ay this shit got rollback, right?
[5:24:57] <+healnavi> real blight town hours
[5:24:57] <+MosesUnspoken> is this the final boss?
[5:24:58] <brachydios777> Put rollback in Everhood
[5:24:58] <nyacoo> a multiplayer mode would be nice
[5:24:59] <+vaderxyz1970> Infinite vs had better netcode
[5:25:00] <Yomamma1337> @atlasdotwav |TEN SECONDS|
[5:25:03] <dg4ii> i didn't really have frame issues when I played the game either
[5:25:06] <Emerald_Emperor> yeah thats really unfortunate that they are having problems with that :(
[5:25:20] <+healnavi> no we see them
[5:25:20] <+swymbiote> we can see the stutters
[5:25:20] <ManfredA> yeah same, I had no issues with it
[5:25:22] <dg4ii> oh we can see the skipped frames
[5:25:25] <gespenstkick> We see the frame drops yea
[5:25:26] <ManfredA> very unfortunate that Woolz is
[5:25:28] <+maria_luke> I can definitely see the skips
[5:25:31] <+swymbiote> they're definitely happening just don't know why
[5:25:38] <BlackermanZX> bitrate died a long time ago
[5:25:39] <+Laycas49> Can absolutely see them
[5:25:39] <Dopamien> idk whenever I run the game Its like a 50/50 for me to run at 144 or 30
[5:25:40] <+maria_luke> It all twitches forward
[5:25:40] <+BigBruthaThunda> I don't really know what a memory leak is, but I know the devs admitted that there is one
[5:25:41] <HotSauceFiend> I cant remember having frame skips but I never played for 4 hours straight either
[5:26:04] <+swymbiote> @BigBruthaThunda they patched the memory leak in april last year
[5:26:07] <CommandantKobold> PogChamp
[5:26:07] <Tisaric> they've tried (and I believe mostly succeded) at fixing the memory leaks they know about
[5:26:09] <Pistofficer> this is the most fucked up subway surfer mod ivve ever seen
[5:26:14] <Tisaric> but I think there's still some lingering issues
[5:26:16] <+Jiggisnipe> just saw it
[5:26:16] <brachydios777> Lets go
[5:26:17] <+kewlmyc> You got this Woolz!
[5:26:19] <%andrewofbob> 3 burn
[5:26:26] <Pookiedaexzile> IT fucking Loops
[5:26:26] <+PunkMcFox> You got to the loop
[5:26:27] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[5:26:32] <%polothegreatest> Loop doodCrazy
[5:26:36] <jett_eyes> [KINGU CRIMSON]
[5:26:37] <+BigBruthaThunda> @swymbiote not all the way then, because I played this a couple weeks ago and had the same issues
[5:26:39] <+healnavi> He's got it!
[5:26:45] <Pookiedaexzile> FUCK this Level
[5:26:46] <PizzicatoFive5> the fucking zigzag part man, go study that one
[5:26:47] <+MosesUnspoken> yeah, the drops are bad
[5:26:51] <KaiserMario> Sweat and tears
[5:26:54] <declanspooky> is this part of the story or a bonus fight?
[5:27:00] <+PunkMcFox> Kill your makers woolie
[5:27:02] <Yomamma1337> @BigBruthaThunda right but is that the games problem, or your computer?
[5:27:04] <ManfredA> this is basically one of the superbosses
[5:27:06] <HotSauceFiend> Reggie is an NPC coach sometimes. "You're doing it player"
[5:27:07] <skyshinecrusader> You ARE doing it we believe
[5:27:08] <+swymbiote> the memory leak was causing fps drops not hitches
[5:27:09] <BlackermanZX> honestly if its dropping too much do it on story mode
[5:27:21] <+BigBruthaThunda> @Yomamma1337 I'm guessing the game, because I played it on switch not pc
[5:27:22] <+maria_luke> if only we had save states.
[5:27:37] <ManfredA> holding on to what you am
[5:27:39] <Yomamma1337> @BigBruthaThunda oh then it was definitely the switchs lol, the game runs like ass on switch
[5:27:45] <+maria_luke> Then we could just reboot the game and get right back into it.
[5:27:48] <+swymbiote> yeah the switch version has some issues
[5:27:48] <KaiserMario> 8 frames of lag
[5:27:49] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> YO THESE DEVS ON WIFI
[5:27:52] <gespenstkick> When in doubt about dropped frames, chech windows update
[5:27:55] <+BigBruthaThunda> @Yomamma1337 but Woolie is playing on PC rn
[5:27:59] <+healnavi> @yomamma1337 The game. This really shouldn't be having these issues.
[5:28:01] <%andrewofbob> Restart the .exe?
[5:28:02] <%polothegreatest> SNK boss AI doodCrazy
[5:28:02] <stevenellis386> When The Game Starts To Fight You.
[5:28:15] <Yomamma1337> @BigBruthaThunda thats the point, noone else on pc has said they have any problems
[5:28:16] <skyshinecrusader> Brazilian ken in your rhythm game
[5:28:17] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> these devs had 2 wifi bars before you accepted the duel
[5:28:22] <%emptyantics> #ROLLBACK4EVERHOOD
[5:28:36] <+Jiggisnipe> lol
[5:28:44] <%arkv01> take 5 maybe
[5:28:47] <+healnavi> yeah
[5:28:50] <+BigBruthaThunda> @Yomamma1337 lol I found several complaints online, but its nice that some didn't have it
[5:28:52] <Tisaric> PC players have definitely had issues with memory in the past
[5:28:55] <+Flarepulse> it does get worse
[5:29:01] <sud4ii> Stay strong Woolie
[5:29:02] <ryogeo> @WoolieVersus take a break woolie
[5:29:04] <%polothegreatest> @skyshinecrusader LUL
[5:29:04] <+maria_luke> (#rollbackp4ultimax #rollbackdbzfighterz
[5:29:15] <Yomamma1337> @BigBruthaThunda yes and all of those complaints are before they fixed it.  unless youre looking at recent complains
[5:29:15] <%derpumpkinking> I can attest to a very leaky ship on PC
[5:29:18] <+PunkMcFox> Woolie's spirit breaking woolieYIKES
[5:29:19] <Tisaric> They probably didn't fix every single bug and it's just this last lingering one
[5:29:29] <nyacoo> Fight against the memory leak
[5:29:29] <+Lionkevinson> Is this level optional?
[5:29:32] <Tisaric> because debugging memory issues is hard
[5:29:33] <Atomic_Blowfish> woolie you are the world's strongest man! fight with all your heart!
[5:29:37] <+BigBruthaThunda> @Yomamma1337 yes, old, new, the issues were the same
[5:29:41] <+Lionkevinson> Or you have to beat it?
[5:29:43] <jett_eyes> Take a break and next time you'll beat it first try
[5:29:45] <+maria_luke> @lionkevinson yes
[5:29:45] <%derpumpkinking> My only fix was restart the
[5:29:50] <Yomamma1337> I havent seen anyone claim pc issues
[5:29:51] <+BigBruthaThunda> literally what is happening here
[5:29:54] <+Flarepulse> switch
[5:29:54] <randomahole> you can do it Woolie
[5:29:56] <%arkv01> someone said its on switch
[5:29:56] <+maria_luke> @lionkevinson it's optional
[5:29:58] <%derpumpkinking> game every hour or two.
[5:29:58] <ryogeo> @WoolieVersus i think this game is on switch
[5:29:58] <Yomamma1337> the switch version runslike ass
[5:30:00] <kinkade_77> switch
[5:30:06] <Dopamien> yea, Id have to restart several times to get it right
[5:30:08] <%ekodrop> don't be mean to reggie
[5:30:08] <+Lionkevinson> Thanks maria
[5:30:15] <BlackermanZX> the Stadia Keepo
[5:30:21] <Aussie_Manny> Haha FUCK that.
[5:30:21] <+maria_luke> @lionkevinson no problem ^v^
[5:30:21] <%arkv01> why is this game optimized to run like ass LUL
[5:30:29] <Tisaric> it's not running like ass
[5:30:29] <brachydios777> Oh fuck that
[5:30:32] <Tisaric> it's just not perfect
[5:30:38] <PizzicatoFive5> I think it's kinda unfair to throw shit at a game made by two guys for running like ass
[5:30:42] <nyacoo> Google Stadia version when?
[5:30:57] <Aussie_Manny> Castle Super Beast Rig.
[5:31:00] <ManfredA> it's not running like ass, just has some strange frame drops due to memory issues it seems
[5:31:04] <+healnavi> It's likely an oversight with the previous fix based on concurrent processes
[5:31:18] <%polothegreatest> LUL switch version? Hell no LUL
[5:31:19] <%derpumpkinking> I haven't tried switch version. but I can assure you thats Woolies superb Artisan Build PC can handle it #sponsor
[5:31:19] <dg4ii> @WoolieVersus maybe try putting on photosensitivity options?
[5:31:24] <Aussie_Manny> Reggie needs to eat and sleep, man.
[5:31:25] <+maria_luke> I won't throw shit, but I will express mild disappointment and understanding
[5:31:26] <PizzicatoFive5> granted I know nothing about game optimisation, but if big ass game studios have trouble with that I'd think two guys in their basement would have it way worse
[5:31:40] <ManfredA> man
[5:31:45] <ManfredA> I hope we get Silksong news this year
[5:31:48] <BlackermanZX> the determination on this man
[5:31:52] <Pookiedaexzile> This is personal for Woolie now
[5:31:57] <+swymbiote> this is also the most intensive fight in the game, if anything's going to have framedrops it'll be this one
[5:32:03] <Blank9> this is like if any metroidvania suddenly became la mulana at the end
[5:32:09] <%ekodrop> i'm like just ahk this first part
[5:32:10] <+swymbiote> most bullets, most flash,es most movement
[5:32:11] <HotSauceFiend> I stil cant beleive there are people who cleared this on expert mode no hit
[5:32:13] <+healnavi> @pizzicatofive5 This. it's not an indictment of the game to say this is probably a memory leak error on the program's side
[5:32:50] <Tisaric> hell it could easily be something caused by Unity that they don't even have full control over
[5:33:27] <Aussie_Manny> That first section ain't SHIT!
[5:33:27] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1490976552661979140?t=ZdiSmYj01DtZhJb8xco6Ig&s=19
[5:33:28] <Pookiedaexzile> Indicting this game is fine
[5:33:28] <+healnavi> @tisaric This too. Unity projects are often unoptimized as fuck due to its nature.
[5:33:38] <Pookiedaexzile> Indict the fuck outta this
[5:33:42] <Videogomez> nice gameplay
[5:33:45] <hassanico2> "Will not fix"
[5:33:58] <+healnavi> this kind of error is likely the sort where the RAM needs to be ENTIRELY dumped, AKA a PC restart
[5:34:04] <Aussie_Manny> Everhood should be louder, angrier, and give access to a time machine.
[5:34:05] <PizzicatoFive5> The stupid grin on the developer's face fills you with Determination.  SAVE  GO BACK
[5:34:06] <+swymbiote> how long has the pc been on tho
[5:34:19] <+maria_luke> I don't think Woolie would ever play Pathologic (1 or 2) but if he did, could you imagine how much struggling there could be? (or maybe not because he'd hear about it's reputation and understand)
[5:34:20] <gespenstkick> Input eaten LUL
[5:34:21] <NewDonkKing> memory leak ? class d bug
[5:34:22] <Aussie_Manny> I SAW THAT
[5:34:27] <Blank9> goddamn that slowdown
[5:34:29] <Aussie_Manny> THAT FRAME DROP WAS HORSE SHIT
[5:34:29] <nyacoo> Story mode?
[5:34:31] <%Indigo_Automaton> Strange, there are recent issues with Unity and memory leaks for VR games too
[5:34:32] <Blank9> everhood for the nes
[5:34:35] <HotSauceFiend> that was gross the slowdown
[5:34:36] <Saltmeisterr> that was a CHUG
[5:34:39] <+BigBruthaThunda> It sounds like they at least tried to fix it
[5:34:51] <+kewlmyc> It hurts just watching as a viewer. Can't imagine what you're going through Woolz.
[5:34:53] <Aussie_Manny> What the FUCK can a player even do about that?? lytWIPED
[5:34:54] <%arkv01> frame drops in a game like this is basically fuck you
[5:35:05] <Yomamma1337> @Aussie_Manny get a better pc lmao
[5:35:06] <gespenstkick> Dev Gnomes' power is lousy lag management
[5:35:08] <%atlasdotwav> This IS the right boss to ask about it
[5:35:08] <Aussie_Manny> And it's not even that much!
[5:35:11] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> what is happening with these frame drops
[5:35:11] <jett_eyes> Woolie's computer is tired of running the boss
[5:35:12] <NewDonkKing> i think you should take a break man
[5:35:21] <ManfredA> This might just be a whole ass restart or call it for the day situation
[5:35:22] <+healnavi> nah, this doesn't look like the gameplay is causing this. it doesn't correlate to intense segments
[5:35:23] <Videogomez> there's a photosensitivity toggle in options
[5:35:23] <%waltzqueen> Take 5 if you need to man
[5:35:24] <kinkade_77> is this the games hardest fight
[5:35:26] <kes009900> was the video guide he saw hitless and chugless?
[5:35:30] <Aussie_Manny> omg i can see the game falling a-fuckin'-part
[5:35:32] <+PunkMcFox> Nothing is worst than when a good game has technical problems.
[5:35:33] <+healnavi> it seems to proc on new segment loading
[5:35:33] <Pookiedaexzile> What makes this funnier is the fact that this is a glamor level about the creators t
[5:35:53] <Aussie_Manny> Sans never had frame drops, as far as I can recall.
[5:36:07] <+maria_luke> wait, how many times has woolie tried after saying he'd give it "a few more tries"?
[5:36:14] <Videogomez> sans also ran at 30fps bc gamemaker couldnt do better
[5:36:19] <+healnavi> @aussie_manny Game Maker is way more lightweight and harder to goof up
[5:36:21] <%arkv01> we've been at this for uhh 3 hours now?
[5:36:22] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> this is a pc only thing that happens rarely
[5:36:25] <+BigBruthaThunda> @Aussie_Manny but Sans was a cheater Kappa
[5:36:26] <Tisaric> yeah gamemaker is a completely different beast than unity
[5:36:35] <PizzicatoFive5> "a couple more then we give it a rest"
[5:36:36] <BlackermanZX> playing and recording seems to just kill the performance
[5:36:48] <stevenellis386> This is the test, woolie. We all go through it as gamers , but this is where our integrity matters most. Push through till the end, man!
[5:36:50] <+healnavi> this game would absolutely not run well on GameMaker (at least, not without some real whizzes coding it)
[5:36:54] <Videogomez> stream just ends lul
[5:36:55] <nyacoo> Optimism: Gone
[5:36:57] <stevenellis386> Dont give up
[5:36:59] <BlackermanZX> unity is just fucked
[5:37:00] <gespenstkick> It's time to stop!
[5:37:01] <+kewlmyc> What difficulty is it on?
[5:37:09] <+maria_luke> Woolie you gave it a few tries, it's good.
[5:37:13] <Yomamma1337> @kewlmyc easy, afaik
[5:37:14] <kinkade_77> giving up is ok
[5:37:15] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> ! WOOLIE AT RISK !
[5:37:15] <%polothegreatest> MMX buster noises woolieGASM
[5:37:18] <Victory_Boss> GAME OVER YEAAAH
[5:37:20] <Blank9> the soul is leaving the body, but at least the soul is immortal
[5:37:25] <+Jiggisnipe> he reloaded so idk if it's still easy
[5:37:27] <Videogomez> did they save beofre the fight? just reset the game
[5:37:30] <%emptyantics> Just come back tomorrow dude its ok
[5:37:32] <%arkv01> woolieDATTEBAYO
[5:37:35] <T_Sasquatch> video games are fun
[5:37:36] <+kewlmyc> This is easy? Fucking Jesus Christ
[5:37:36] <Yomamma1337> the answer is that you dont zig, you just stand in the middlr
[5:37:38] <%emptyantics> woolieDATTEBAYO
[5:37:40] <+Lionkevinson> This is easy mode !?
[5:37:43] <%atlasdotwav> Chat is he close?
[5:37:45] <+froduck42> catJAM
[5:37:52] <+Lionkevinson> Tf?
[5:37:56] <PizzicatoFive5> honestly getting it to loop once was the endgoal, everything after that is just vanity
[5:37:57] <Pookiedaexzile> it  loops
[5:38:00] <%arkv01> this shit will keep him up tonight wooliePOYO
[5:38:09] <+BuckChuckman> Punished Woolie
[5:38:11] <+healnavi> @atlasdotwav He was, then the game started chugging
[5:38:12] <Tisaric> @Lionkevinson the only thing difficulty changes is health/regen values, the charts remain the same
[5:38:12] <dg4ii> @kewlmyc the difficulties dont effect charting except story mode (which doesn't affect this fight). Difficulties mainly just boost/reduce health and regen
[5:38:21] <+maria_luke> It really will, wont it.
[5:38:26] <+Lionkevinson> @tisaric Gotcha
[5:38:33] <%atlasdotwav> @healnavi Feels real bad
[5:38:36] <dg4ii> and the leniancy with how early you're allowed to absorb projectiles
[5:38:38] <Aussie_Manny> This is ironic, now that I think about it and look at the boss trying to get Everhood to "work".
[5:38:47] <BlackermanZX> Woolie didn't know what he was signing in for
[5:38:51] <Pookiedaexzile> This is what they call Go Home Heat
[5:39:06] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @meteor530
[5:39:07] <Dopamien> also the game is a lot easier on keyboard. for me at least
[5:39:09] <+Jiggisnipe> sick dodges guy
[5:39:19] <+maria_luke> @pookiedaexzile or burn home heat.

[5:40:40] <%arkv01> SMASH
[5:40:45] <Aussie_Manny> I mean, Reggie jumping in now, that would mean Reggie would have to do several dozen runs just to warm up.
[5:40:48] <BlackermanZX> this is what it feels like to be hit by a Winter Lantern
[5:40:50] <+maria_luke> Hold the line, Reggie!

[5:42:54] <alroy909> that was a good first try damn
[5:42:54] <Victory_Boss> Reggie cracked

[5:43:05] <brachydios777> Holy shit Reggie
[5:43:13] <+maria_luke> Reggie, you observed really good. gg.
[5:43:14] <gespenstkick> Reg was taking notes!
[5:43:26] <+Lionkevinson> Ganbare Reggie!!!
[5:43:40] <+robertoszek> feel the music!
[5:43:46] <+pupil31> Sadge
[5:43:47] <+healnavi> The true Woolie Vs starts now
[5:44:10] <+meteor530> Naw it's Reggie Vs. now
[5:44:15] <%arkv01> I love it when reggie takes the wheel and floors it
[5:44:15] <+Jiggisnipe> woah
[5:44:18] <chaosjoey> that triple jump was insane
[5:44:22] <+FlashTrickstar> Ohhhhh shit it's the dev gnomes!
[5:44:26] <glass_marcus> Is he...is he the chosen one?
[5:44:28] <+pupil31> SourPls
[5:44:29] <Aussie_Manny> "Slow down"? lytKEK
[5:44:30] <Tisaric> I definitely feel like part of it is you really need to get into that flow state where you actually are just flying by reactions alone
[5:44:51] <Tisaric> with some prep of course but that flow state is what really gets you there
[5:45:00] <+Jiggisnipe> yea I agree
[5:45:14] <Yomamma1337> @Tisaric nah woolies problem is that hes focusing on the character instead of the notes, you should be memorizing the entire track not just 1 lane
[5:45:18] <Aussie_Manny> I don't think bashing Everhood is fixing it, Bosses.
[5:45:21] <%waltzqueen> @Tisaric bless that rythm game trance state. i SSS combo'd so many games
[5:45:22] <ManfredA> that's key to mastering rhythm games, part of it really is just reaction
[5:45:23] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> Cat God is easier to get into the flow than this
[5:45:27] <+meteor530> You can do eeet Red Geno
[5:45:42] <chaosjoey> its the devs making the game as you play the game
[5:45:43] <Aussie_Manny> lytJIVE lytJIVE lytJIVE lytJIVE lytJIVE
[5:45:49] <dg4ii> cat god has a few memorization moments but is definitely mostly reaction
[5:46:17] <dg4ii> you really have to learn how to do the wall of orange though
[5:46:23] <gespenstkick> use your silver knight parry powers reg!
[5:46:24] <Tisaric> yeah these frame drops really fucking suck
[5:46:36] <%derpumpkinking> This is what i was afraid of happening earlier.
[5:46:37] <+maria_luke> @dg4ii I thought you said "monetization" for a sec lol
[5:46:45] <brachydios777> Believe in Reggie
[5:46:55] <chaosjoey> this fight is so miserable, but also not bad somehow
[5:47:06] <+meteor530> Get it Reggie get, get, get, it!
[5:47:21] <Tisaric> yeah like that was reggie purely going on reaction
[5:47:25] <+Lionkevinson> Reggie! Reggie! Reggie!
[5:47:34] <Tisaric> and he got out of it nearly full health

[5:47:48] <%derpumpkinking> That was nicely done Reginald! Mmmmmhnnn yes
[5:47:56] <Aussie_Manny> Oh no, it's making the frame drops worse! ...Oh well. Release it.

[5:50:26] <Aussie_Manny> Chris and Jordi, the devs, just BEATING on Everhood 'til it's done.

[5:57:18] <brachydios777> but what if though!?
[5:57:21] <dg4ii> I have faith that they'll at least beat the dev gnomes tonight
[5:57:23] <+Jiggisnipe> Woolie will collapse into mush after he beats this
[5:57:39] <%derpumpkinking> i hope so. thats too much a push
[5:57:47] <%atlasdotwav> woolieGLORY
[5:57:54] <Aussie_Manny> lytRUN
[5:57:55] <PizzicatoFive5> imagine beating this game and going "yeah, I'm gonna speedrun it now"
[5:58:09] <+meteor530> Suffering like G did
[5:58:11] <Aussie_Manny> Damn, same spot.
[5:58:15] <dg4ii> literally nobody has done an impossible difficulty speedrun
[5:58:24] <brachydios777> They should get a WWE style belt for Everhood after this
[5:58:31] <dg4ii> I almost want to do one that'll take like 24 hours just for the WR
[5:58:33] <PizzicatoFive5> is this as hard as this stage gets btw?
[5:58:38] <Tisaric> oh god impossible difficulty speedrun sounds like pure insanity
[5:58:41] <+Lionkevinson> Same spot‚Ä¶.
[5:58:46] <PizzicatoFive5> as in, is there a higher difficulty or something?
[5:58:52] <Yomamma1337> youre just moving too much on the zigzag
[5:58:59] <BlackermanZX> this is easy mode
[5:59:03] <dg4ii> @PizzicatoFive5 i mean theres impossible difficulty that makes you die in one hit
[5:59:06] <Tisaric> difficulty just changes health values but there's like 4 difficulties above this
[5:59:08] <dg4ii> also yeah this is one easy
[5:59:16] <+meteor530> I really hope this game comes to PS.
[5:59:16] <+DreyfussFrost> Is lane 3 really the best option at the end of the zigzag? 5 looks safer.
[5:59:17] <AppleBerryKitty> wow
[5:59:27] <%polothegreatest> E-easy? doodWat
[5:59:34] <PizzicatoFive5> so is this like selecting difficulty in SMT Nocturne
[5:59:35] <brachydios777> 2 hours!?
[5:59:35] <+vaderxyz1970> 2 hour race is fun
[5:59:36] <nyacoo> Is there a no-hit run for this fight?
[5:59:45] <+Lionkevinson> You didn‚Äôt win!
[5:59:48] <Atomic_Blowfish> WOOLIE THE KING
[5:59:50] <Teradyne87> 12 hour endurance on the Nurburghring. I remember doing that on Gran Turismo 5
[5:59:52] <+Lionkevinson> Lol jk woolie
[5:59:53] <%derpumpkinking> 3-4 where my main lanes for this.
[5:59:57] <dg4ii> @nyacoo yes, because every fight has a no-hit achievment
[6:00:07] <Tisaric> yes people have no-hit every boss, they've been watching a video to lab a bit
[6:00:18] <dg4ii> and people have that achievment. Also the video that shows every fight no-hit
[6:00:21] <AppleBerryKitty> lytJIVE pandoraSing pandoraHI
[6:00:34] <+DreyfussFrost> And insane difficulty only gives you 1HP, so any hit is death.
[6:00:36] <Teradyne87> I took a break and let my AI-driver take over every few hours
[6:00:44] <dg4ii> also Incinerator hitless, which makes this look like a cakewalk
[6:01:10] <+robertoszek> YEYEYEYEYE
[6:01:10] <%derpumpkinking> I am missing no hit on Incinerator Cat, Gnomes, and Pacifist Frog
[6:01:12] <Tisaric> yeah incinerator no hit I believe is the least gotten achievement
[6:01:19] <nyacoo> oof that lag
[6:01:22] <AppleBerryKitty> NOW GO
[6:01:23] <%derpumpkinking> i have given up on these accolades.
[6:01:24] <+TopTieramisu> gotta love the added difficulty of lag
[6:01:35] <Tisaric> oh he's got it
[6:01:35] <PizzicatoFive5> you've got it man
[6:01:38] <+Jiggisnipe> ok

[6:04:58] <+KisukeOboro> ffffffffff
[6:04:59] <+Jiggisnipe> what
[6:05:02] <PizzicatoFive5> so what the fuck?
[6:05:02] <Aussie_Manny> WHAT
[6:05:13] <%derpumpkinking> Gotta love that fourth lane more
[6:05:15] <%arkv01> this game is literally gaslighting you
[6:05:17] <brachydios777> What!?
[6:05:23] <BlackermanZX> pain
[6:05:35] <jett_eyes> I hate it when games obscure the screen at low health
[6:05:36] <Yomamma1337> i didnt see anything
[6:05:41] <Scorchfield> not seeing it
[6:05:41] <Videogomez> but you were dying
[6:05:43] <+KisukeOboro> what do you mean?
[6:05:46] <chaosjoey> woolie's seeing red
[6:05:47] <+KisukeOboro> Woolie's losing it
[6:05:49] <+Jiggisnipe> it's so much on the screen so idk
[6:05:49] <ManfredA> you were dying
[6:05:51] <dg4ii> i'll keep an eye out
[6:06:03] <NewDonkKing> developing eyes on the inside
[6:06:08] <Tisaric> oh yeah you're going to see the walls melt for a bit once you finally finish LUL
[6:06:10] <BlackermanZX> starting to mind break
[6:06:11] <%derpumpkinking> You got low health, healed up and went back to low health again so your bar flashed up and down.
[6:06:12] <nyacoo> delirious
[6:06:32] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[6:06:37] <%SuperBloodWolfMoon> the addition of shooting made this game significantly more frustrating and less fun
[6:06:51] <@Menitta> How far has he gotten?
[6:06:51] <Yomamma1337> @SuperBloodWolfMoon the shooting is definitely the best part of the game
[6:06:52] <+DreyfussFrost> Yeah you were dying. You were low health going into the zigzag.
[6:06:55] <Aussie_Manny> I just checked the clip just now, it was flashing red, but Woolie's health was low.
[6:06:56] <Videogomez> the dnd deflect mechanic was better than the absorb/shoot
[6:07:00] <+Jiggisnipe> @Menitta very close
[6:07:06] <@Menitta> nice. good jpb
[6:07:13] <%derpumpkinking> That new visual stimulation added probably is what hit ya.
[6:07:17] <Tisaric> he got to a point where it was 1 or 2 hits away
[6:07:22] <+BigBruthaThunda> @SuperBloodWolfMoon i agree
[6:07:41] <AppleBerryKitty> lytJIVE pandoraHI lytJIVE pandoraHI
[6:07:56] <%derpumpkinking> He's been a c-hair within reach yeah.

[6:13:53] <brachydios777> There‚Äôs no way this is harder
[6:13:56] <%derpumpkinking> So fun fact
[6:13:57] <dg4ii> @healnavi this and what comes immediately after it
[6:14:11] <Tisaric> this should be the last of the content outside of insane side missions like the 4 hour hallway
[6:14:15] <%derpumpkinking> This is the full track from The Experiment fight from Orange
[6:14:16] <dg4ii> will say the static noise in this fight kind of sucks and I want an EQ on this shit
[6:14:19] <Videogomez> i dont like the head bobbing
[6:14:22] <CommandantKobold> SourPls
[6:14:29] <%baronblank> you can spare this one btw
[6:14:39] <%emptyantics> Easiest boss in the game
[6:14:40] <+Jiggisnipe> geea
[6:14:41] <Atomic_Blowfish> this is nothing after the dev gnomes
[6:14:42] <+Jiggisnipe> geez
[6:14:46] <CuttleCrow> you dont have to kill cat god
[6:14:47] <Videogomez> ez boss
[6:14:49] <Atomic_Blowfish> this should be your vicrory lap
[6:14:55] <Yomamma1337> @CuttleCrow unless you want story, which he deos
[6:15:00] <%derpumpkinking> Content requires kill
[6:15:12] <brachydios777> Live die repeat
[6:15:12] <%emptyantics> >weakest superboss in Underhood LUL
[6:15:13] <NewDonkKing> not on easy any more
[6:15:17] <CuttleCrow> oh boy
[6:15:27] <%baronblank> oh, does the cat stop you from entering the house or something if you spare?
[6:15:31] <Aussie_Manny> üëÅÔ∏è üëÅÔ∏è üëÅÔ∏è
[6:15:33] <%derpumpkinking> Yeah.
[6:15:34] <BlackermanZX> oh yeah is this still on hard
[6:15:42] <nyacoo> no, easy
[6:15:43] <CuttleCrow> its on easy
[6:15:44] <dg4ii> @baronblank you don't get the finale ******* *****
[6:15:47] <Yomamma1337> @baronblank the difference between kill and no kill is an absolute truth
[6:15:52] <%emptyantics> Its on easy
[6:15:52] <NewDonkKing> save file changed
[6:15:52] <MurseJOCO> Open your whispering eye
[6:15:53] <Aussie_Manny> I'm sure there's some Naruto reference we can make to a third eye or some shit.
[6:15:56] <%cobalt_phoenix_> im pretty sure he changed it guys
[6:15:56] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[6:15:59] <%derpumpkinking> You just get a "Good job bud!" for spare
[6:16:08] <%derpumpkinking> You get story for kill.
[6:16:24] <+Flarepulse> the opposite is true @derpumpkinking
[6:16:24] <Yomamma1337> woolie you cant absorb the
[6:16:25] <CuttleCrow> oranges in front
[6:16:26] <Yomamma1337> them*
[6:16:27] <dg4ii> no, spare still gets you the ending
[6:16:33] <+Jiggisnipe> idk if you absorb those
[6:16:34] <nyacoo> There's one bullet and one skull
[6:16:39] <Lazy_Vagabond> the skulls have a yellow in front of them
[6:16:39] <jett_eyes> yee, theres a yellow then a skull
[6:16:42] <Tisaric> @WoolieVersus there's 2 hitboxes on the skull ones, you're absorbing the bullet but not the skull
[6:16:48] <Aussie_Manny> I swear it's BECAUSE of the red borders at low health that the frame drops begin... ü§î Maybe.
[6:16:53] <brachydios777> Yellow then skull
[6:16:53] <CuttleCrow> the oranges in front are actually safer to be hit by
[6:17:09] <mrtanaka111> still at it uh
[6:17:16] <%derpumpkinking> Oh shit yeah. i got backwards my b.
[6:17:25] <%Indigo_Automaton> Clever Girl
[6:17:29] <+meteor530> Yo take these colorz
[6:17:30] <Videogomez> follow the lane
[6:17:35] <Yomamma1337> theres a clear path forward
[6:17:39] <nyacoo> Objective: Survive
[6:17:40] <DarknessHS> just follow the lanes
[6:17:41] <+Flarepulse> follow that rainbow brick road
[6:17:45] <%derpumpkinking> But Truth is still the way to go
[6:17:47] <dg4ii> you just have to survive the orange walls
[6:17:48] <Videogomez> defense mode
[6:17:49] <+maria_luke> that gold pathway only has one road
[6:17:52] <jett_eyes> there are no shots to take on the rainbow path
[6:18:04] <%derpumpkinking> So kill.
[6:18:24] <+meteor530> I feel right side might be the better bet
[6:18:38] <$pixelkenj> sometimes the other side will have less walls
[6:18:39] <+Flarepulse> YEA you got it
[6:18:43] <+DreyfussFrost> PogChamp
[6:18:48] <DreiDD> NICE
[6:18:51] <Videogomez> going well
[6:18:52] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[6:18:56] <+Mekhet09> Time to stop.
[6:18:57] <dg4ii> uh oh!
[6:18:57] <brachydios777> Walls are the key
[6:18:57] <%derpumpkinking> Yeah its mostly a block battle
[6:18:59] <+Mekhet09> For the night.
[6:19:00] <Atomic_Blowfish> block to the rhythm big man you got this
[6:19:01] <Tisaric> you don't have to do this woolie
[6:19:04] <Yomamma1337> no\
[6:19:05] <dg4ii> no
[6:19:06] <%arkv01> yo take it easy woolz we need your arms for the rest of this week..
[6:19:06] <%derpumpkinking> no
[6:19:06] <%Indigo_Automaton> Rest Woolie!
[6:19:06] <nyacoo> No
[6:19:08] <ManfredA> No
[6:19:08] <dg4ii> there is content after this
[6:19:10] <Videogomez> there is more
[6:19:10] <BlackermanZX> taking physical damage
[6:19:10] <+maria_luke> Woolie TAKE A BREAK IF YOUR AEM HURTS
[6:19:12] <jett_eyes> NO
[6:19:12] <+KnightedLink> no
[6:19:13] <%townzzzzz> woolie at nite
[6:19:13] <ManfredA> this is a proper ending
[6:19:14] <dg4ii> YES
[6:19:15] <+Flarepulse> theres a little more
[6:19:16] <%cobalt_phoenix_> idk if its my headphones but there's like a weird static/buzzing that's messing with my head
[6:19:17] <Yomamma1337> theres more
[6:19:19] <DreiDD> hes going out of spite at this point LUL
[6:19:21] <%Indigo_Automaton> There is a proper ending
[6:19:21] <brachydios777> Boneitus
[6:19:22] <$pixelkenj> ....some stuff
[6:19:24] <jett_eyes> There are, uh, two endings
[6:19:25] <+meteor530> You get to feel good about yrself
[6:19:25] <%emptyantics> There‚Äôs more LUL LUL
[6:19:27] <%derpumpkinking> Yeah. theres still two endings other than corridor
[6:19:27] <Yomamma1337> everyones saying the same thing
[6:19:36] <+healnavi> TRUST ME Kappa
[6:19:36] <Aussie_Manny> There's MORE after this?? Aww fuck.
[6:19:39] <Tisaric> there are things to be seen but they're not going to answer any lingering questions
[6:19:40] <+Jiggisnipe> sounds like it's a true or proper ending
[6:19:48] <dg4ii> @Aussie_Manny nothing difficult after this
[6:19:58] <+Flarepulse> crank that shit to Story Mode and go get your lore
[6:20:08] <%crybirb> This part at least seems very fun
[6:20:08] <+theoldone001> Pat comes on screen and says; "You Did it."
[6:20:12] <%derpumpkinking> I recommend just this one you are on. if you take out orange before this you can get an alternate end
[6:20:13] <Yomamma1337> just do story mode
[6:20:17] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[6:20:20] <$pixelkenj> üëè
[6:20:21] <%Explodincatz> good stream
[6:20:21] <%emptyantics> There‚Äôs 10 more super bosses and then it turns into a beat em up and then it turns into Undertale 2 back from the hood
[6:20:22] <%townzzzzz> arm at rick
[6:20:23] <CuttleCrow> LUL
[6:20:23] <+meteor530> Throwing in the towel. It was fun Woolie
[6:20:23] <Aussie_Manny> lytCLAP lytCLAP lytCLAP lytCLAP lytCLAP
[6:20:23] <jett_eyes> understood
[6:20:24] <Scorchfield> thanks for giving it a try
[6:20:24] <+Jiggisnipe> good job
[6:20:26] <%townzzzzz> risk
[6:20:26] <%polothegreatest> Pride a accomplishment? Idk LUL
[6:20:28] <PizzicatoFive5> that wasn't as bullshitty as the dev fight
[6:20:29] <dg4ii> if you aren't coming back to it will you watch the ending on stream?
[6:20:34] <+mdrenny1321> lytCLAP ggs
[6:20:34] <+Jiggisnipe> most people would take breaks
[6:20:54] <%polothegreatest> LUL LUL GG
[6:21:20] <MurseJOCO> That was like being in the hyperbolic time chamber ü§Ø
[6:21:21] <$pixelkenj> oh that memory leak still happens?
[6:21:24] <%derpumpkinking> Not the best game to stream unless you are real familiar with it. But I have enjoyed watching your ride through nonetheless.
[6:21:25] <jett_eyes> the only optional ending that's really REALLY worth it is Frog's Wrath
[6:21:29] <haisho> the frame drops are really bad considering the timings on some things
[6:21:34] <Yomamma1337> @WoolieVersus i havent seen anyone else with technical problems recently, it seems like a you problem
[6:21:35] <+JustToWatch> But Woolie, the Cat God ending recontextualizes the whole thing (idk)
[6:21:49] <jett_eyes> i d i d i t
[6:21:50] <%Explodincatz> @pixelkenj yes
[6:21:55] <Yomamma1337> @pixelkenj iirc the memory leak was fixed almost a year ago
[6:22:01] <+BigBruthaThunda> cap
[6:22:03] <%Indigo_Automaton> Nonetheless, great work fellas!
[6:22:10] <Videogomez> i mean just reset the game, you already got a save point nearby
[6:22:13] <+healnavi> @yomamma1337 It doesn't stop being a game problem just because it only happens to some people man
[6:22:14] <Aussie_Manny> I don't believe that for a second.
[6:22:20] <%Irridium> "works on my machine :)"
[6:22:24] <%Indigo_Automaton> I noticed some skips late-game but my sessions were shorter
[6:22:25] <$pixelkenj> Wellll anyway, good show fella
[6:22:31] <%derpumpkinking> Regular Cat God ending is...I guess a good end depending on where you stand on story
[6:22:35] <Videogomez> i played the whole game from start to finish and didn't have any issues
[6:22:36] <+Jiggisnipe> works fine for me
[6:22:40] <BlackermanZX> its unity so its just fuckd by default
[6:22:48] <%emptyantics> It did frame skip for me
[6:22:52] <Aussie_Manny> Rhythmic Undertale.
[6:22:53] <dg4ii> will you be watching the Cat ending on stream or on your own time?
[6:22:59] <%Indigo_Automaton> Oh for sure
[6:22:59] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[6:23:01] <Videogomez> there's a sans fight by the devs
[6:23:01] <+meteor530> Ah the Cyberpunk problem "It works for me idk what ya'll talking bout"....
[6:23:01] <%Jrockoni> OBAMA
[6:23:04] <$pixelkenj> I think the official discord has a directory or something
[6:23:11] <+JustToWatch> there's a dev made megalovania
[6:23:12] <wibbwobbler> Some brutal frame skips
[6:23:18] <+vaderxyz1970> Silverhand
[6:23:19] <Aussie_Manny> omg make THIS a rhythm game with custom songs!
[6:23:21] <%derpumpkinking> There are a great many fan bangers I can attest.
[6:23:23] <Aussie_Manny> tiffosDance tiffosDance tiffosDance tiffosDance tiffosDance
[6:23:23] <Tisaric> there's a super cool RB2 mod that's getting big
[6:23:24] <Yomamma1337> @emptyantics on pc? if so when did you play it and how goods your pc? youre literally the only person say theyve had problems ive seen
[6:23:32] <%polothegreatest> LUL
[6:23:35] <%Shad0wTag> @WoolieVersus Devs made a Sans fight
[6:23:37] <$pixelkenj> good night!
[6:23:41] <@Menitta> ah back for the end
[6:23:43] <+JustToWatch> DAMN
[6:23:46] <Tisaric> my dude I love the game but you don't have to defend it that hard, it has occasional issues
[6:23:47] <%Indigo_Automaton> Great work dudes!
[6:23:50] <xerotwo> LUL
[6:23:51] <BlackermanZX> that was amazing
[6:23:55] <PizzicatoFive5> goddamn Naruto episode
[6:23:55] <@Menitta> That lp was mostly bosses which I LOVE.
[6:23:56] <xerotwo> G G
[6:24:00] <Atomic_Blowfish> congrats
[6:24:14] <%emptyantics> @yomamma1337 Yeah on PC and I have a 3090 on my rig
[6:24:18] <Aussie_Manny> Who recommended it? Fuck you. LUL
[6:24:26] <Yomamma1337> i really want to see pat play this kik
[6:24:28] <Yomamma1337> lol*
[6:24:33] <%emptyantics> It‚Äôs a boss rush
[6:24:36] <+meteor530> Game's so good makes you wanna SLAP yo momma
[6:24:49] <+theoldone001> You did waaaay more than what we expected you to do lol
[6:24:54] <Aussie_Manny> You're not a coward, Woolie. You just lie about your courage.
[6:24:57] <+healnavi> Only cowards give in to peer pressure Kappa
[6:24:57] <Yomamma1337> sifu on thursday
[6:25:12] <%derpumpkinking> Grandma Swamp is my preferred designation over Woolie the Coward tbh
[6:25:15] <%Indigo_Automaton> Demon Bell tho
[6:25:16] <+Flarepulse> No cowards here today
[6:25:18] <+Jiggisnipe> oh you aren't? that's coward talk
[6:25:18] <+vaderxyz1970> Bloody Palace is fun
[6:25:31] <AppleBerryKitty> gg
[6:25:33] <+Jiggisnipe> did the game actually recommend hard?
[6:25:40] <+theoldone001> Has he even lived up to the Grandma Swamp moniker in a while??
[6:25:41] <jett_eyes> sorta
[6:25:44] <Yomamma1337> @emptyantics recently?  gonna have to look into it then
[6:25:44] <%DkLordG> You are not immune to mocking chicken noises
[6:25:48] <+JustToWatch> ok but when Hollow Knight though
[6:25:51] <dg4ii> @Jiggisnipe yes but there are two difficulties above it
[6:25:56] <+vaderxyz1970> Path of pain is "fun"
[6:26:09] <+meteor530> Path of Pain was...painful
[6:26:11] <ManfredA> Masochistic challenges in game are a good thing
[6:26:19] <+vaderxyz1970> this is masochistic
[6:26:20] <jett_eyes> there aren't any special changes unlike the other difficulties
[6:26:34] <Yomamma1337> way easier if you had someone to help
[6:26:41] <Aussie_Manny> Woolie was ready to call it at one point, but a bit of progress extended the stream. lytEYES
[6:26:53] <%polothegreatest> Last part of PoP was bs LUL
[6:26:56] <Tisaric> being honest I feel like too many streamers fall into that trap with this game, chasing the superboss stuff for much longer than they really should
[6:26:58] <%notmicrowavesafe> notmicrowavesafe subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months, currently on a 9 month streak! Fun fact half of a byte (gigabyte, megabyte, kilobyte, etc.) is called a nybble. Keep up the great work.
[6:27:12] <+Jiggisnipe> It didn't seem so bad. Like it wasn't really obtuse
[6:27:22] <BlackermanZX> expected undertale and got rythm dark souls
[6:27:29] <+healnavi> making a game is HARD
[6:27:38] <dg4ii> isn't a byte just a one or a zero? how do you get half a byte? am I dumb?
[6:27:59] <+meteor530> This game probably took some inspiration gameplay wise from AudioSurf is anyone remembers that game
[6:28:01] <+healnavi> @dg4ii a byte is 8 bits
[6:28:01] <%Jrockoni> Its a hell of a first attempt.
[6:28:03] <Tisaric> a byte is 8 0s or 1s
[6:28:06] <+Jiggisnipe> I think that's cool
[6:28:10] <Videogomez> i played this game and it raised my expectations for deltarune. at least visually
[6:28:12] <Tisaric> a bit is a zero or a 1
[6:28:13] <dg4ii> ah i see thank you
[6:28:20] <+Jiggisnipe> more health for you and less health for the boss is cool
[6:28:33] <+theoldone001> Audio Surf is great, Sequence Storm is fucking amazing imho
[6:28:34] <+Jiggisnipe> allowing more mistakes is fair I think
[6:28:42] <+stupidsquid> The game is fun.
[6:29:07] <dg4ii> story mode does change the charts of any song that isn't frog or gnome
[6:29:13] <puluxor> I understand
[6:29:26] <BlackermanZX> they never checked story mode
[6:29:30] <Tisaric> yeah the balance is really weird
[6:29:44] <+Jiggisnipe> oh story mode changes notes?
[6:29:48] <ManfredA> yes
[6:29:53] <+Jiggisnipe> that's cool
[6:30:07] <Aussie_Manny> I love good parrying in adventure/action games.
[6:30:07] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1490976552661979140?t=ZdiSmYj01DtZhJb8xco6Ig&s=19
[6:30:29] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> Dishonored 2 has custom difficulty
[6:30:46] <BlackermanZX> i like the difficulty settings in TWEWY
[6:31:13] <+healnavi> @blackermanzx Every JRPG should let you level down
[6:31:46] <Yomamma1337> @WoolieVersus do you have experience with other rhythm / bullet hell games?
[6:31:57] <+KisukeOboro> It's like starting out on Expert on Guitar Hero and just giving you a huge life bar for more mistakes to be made, but a new player will still have a bad time no matter what lol
[6:32:40] <+meteor530> WHat's that game Ranger something?
[6:32:42] <jett_eyes> does Furi count
[6:32:50] <+Jiggisnipe> ZeroRanger
[6:32:52] <Videogomez> this game does ramp up the difficulty
[6:32:55] <+theoldone001> Does Nier count? Lol
[6:33:02] <+meteor530> Ya that one Zero Ranger is awesome
[6:33:06] <BlackermanZX> Touhou lp when Keepo
[6:33:10] <Videogomez> none of the early game songs are as hard as the hidden boss fights
[6:33:15] <+sewermonk> how far have you got in Zero Ranger?
[6:33:53] <+vaderxyz1970> Nier has a booty to distract you thiugh
[6:34:02] <Videogomez> the game implies this hasnt been the first time you've killed
[6:34:26] <dg4ii> my favorite YAKUZA mechanic, the kill everything system
[6:34:33] <+Jiggisnipe> Rasta says a bunch of people died last time you had your arm
[6:34:39] <+meteor530> Got my new character name "NybbleByte
[6:34:45] <Aussie_Manny> Reboot is the zeitgeist.
