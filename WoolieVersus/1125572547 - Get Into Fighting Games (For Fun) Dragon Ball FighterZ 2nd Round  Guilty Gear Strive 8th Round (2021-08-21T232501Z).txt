[0:12:42] <Pookiedaexzile> All I heard was Street Fighter Strive
[0:12:43] <@Solidus_113> new game
[0:12:48] <leith_aziz> Z Broly laughing with buffs
[0:12:49] <+alphonseisbest> @Sajallday what was he finisher before that?
[0:12:50] <FacetiousAF> max had a sort of breakdown video. its WILD
[0:12:53] <@Solidus_113> you got marvel infinite tags from specials
[0:12:59] <Applecannon63> SUPER BROLY BUFF
[0:13:09] <FacetiousAF> 👏
[0:13:13] <FacetiousAF> i clap for broly
[0:13:17] <Applecannon63> well all grappler buffs
[0:13:17] <andre11dr> They went hard on this patch
[0:13:20] <+runegod20> doesn't sell have a bugged infinite?
[0:13:22] <leith_aziz> I'm actuallly happy that they went with buffs over nerfs. Makes me hopeful fir Strive's changes
[0:13:24] <@Solidus_113> ki charge is now invincible?
[0:13:27] <ullyzeez> damn i wish it was playable tho
[0:13:31] <+coldsama> the tags on special and frame 1 charge ki invincible is hype af
[0:13:33] <leith_aziz> @runegod20 Celll? Yes.
[0:13:38] <JetpackMcQuack> just like actual dragon ball
[0:13:40] <austinj24> Frieza is OD now
[0:13:40] <+chase959> ki charge can't be hit by ki blasts
[0:13:45] <andre11dr> What I'm guessing is that this is testing for DBFZ 2
[0:13:47] <Shad0wTag> @woolieversus We will be killing Goku's tonight right? lytKILLGOKU
[0:13:50] <FacetiousAF> @Solidus_113 i think that's related to opponent ki blasts only??
[0:13:58] <Tracazoid> Tag on special
[0:14:00] <Applecannon63> I only notice stealth nerf on Super Baby
[0:14:00] <+chase959> ki charge dragon rush is crazy on the ground
[0:14:10] <Shad0wTag> Tag on special is right
[0:14:12] <@Solidus_113> command grabs actually combo now with the new tags
[0:14:13] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> man if granblue and fighterz got rollback that'd be sick
[0:14:13] <Katzenjammer4000> @WoolieVersus Any more plans for Yakuza 0 in the future?
[0:14:14] <generalve> This game aged like fine wine
[0:14:19] <Shad0wTag> @chase959 that range and speed is insane
[0:14:36] <Shad0wTag> @katzenjammer4000 its on hiatus
[0:14:38] <leith_aziz> Super Broly got some buffs, but they dont really fix hs big issues. Honestly, with the top and mid tiers being buffed so much, I feel that characters like S Broly, Cooler, A16, A17 among other could become low tier now
[0:14:43] <+LeaIsChill> Every character got buffed except two
[0:14:50] <andre11dr> @katzenjammer4000 it won't be back for a while
[0:14:51] <leith_aziz> Cry SOmething
[0:14:54] <generalve> @woolieversus do you think a vagabond fighting game is possible by arcsys ?
[0:14:55] <leith_aziz> *Something
[0:15:04] <+LeaIsChill> Do they have all the DLC?
[0:15:10] <FacetiousAF> did you even touch it for ssj4?
[0:15:11] <@Solidus_113> Hit Yamcha 16 LUL
[0:15:13] <Haarute> adult gohan on level 7 gets special to special cancelling it's so dumb
[0:15:16] <Katzenjammer4000> thanks
[0:15:22] <leith_aziz> In terms of nerfs, Gotenks, Yamcha and Jiren got the clearest nerfs
[0:15:29] <FacetiousAF> super aka Canon broly
[0:15:37] <andre11dr> Vagabond doesn't seem fitting for a Arcsis game
[0:15:45] <leith_aziz> @Haarute Honestly, since he has to get to Level 7, he might as well get OP
[0:15:49] <Shad0wTag> @leith_aziz I can't stand facing Gotenks so I did not mind
[0:15:50] <+LeaIsChill> Vagabond is the next Absolver Kappa
[0:15:57] <JetpackMcQuack> this shit is complicated
[0:16:13] <andre11dr> Vagabond doesn't seem fitting for a game in general
[0:16:15] <FacetiousAF> swear to god i'm gonna just grab a dreamcast emu and have some sort of mvc2 in my life
[0:16:19] <@Solidus_113> oh, they haven't played since SS4 Gogeta came out
[0:16:19] <%saladin1911> I haven't played DBFZ for like a year and the rust is suffocating me lmao
[0:16:20] <leith_aziz> @Shad0wTag Actually, Gotenks has some weird bugs now, which makes him bonkers
[0:16:21] <andre11dr> Just leave it alone
[0:16:31] <Shad0wTag> Follow the path of Android 16 and dunk the goku's
[0:16:36] <Shad0wTag> @leith_aziz oh god damn it
[0:16:43] <%Juriasu> yup yup yup
[0:16:45] <Applecannon63> Super Broly got buffed for both the damage,grab range and the universal meter gain through EX moves
[0:16:51] <generalve> the only game play
[0:17:04] <JetpackMcQuack> LUL yu yu hakisho fights
[0:17:04] <+LeaIsChill> That's not even the normal game at all, yeah
[0:17:05] <dark_dmt_samurai> Fact
[0:17:09] <leith_aziz> @Shad0wTag Like, I think it gives Cell if he tags after Gotenks an infiinite, and very weird Oki after Level 3
[0:17:20] <+runegod20> we're not sayians but we don't have to be
[0:17:21] <andre11dr> I didn't test this, can 16 combo after comand grabs now?
[0:17:38] <leith_aziz> @andre11dr Not his L Command Grab
[0:17:39] <JetpackMcQuack> fun to watch SeemsGood
[0:17:47] <Shad0wTag> @leith_aziz and to think there's a online tournament in like 3 weeks for the game oh lord
[0:17:58] <Shad0wTag> @andre11dr yes
[0:18:05] <andre11dr> Damn
[0:18:10] <generalve> does not.help that there has been 0 sales for DLC characters :(
[0:18:12] <andre11dr> His real again
[0:18:18] <+LeaIsChill> @generalve it's on sale right now
[0:18:34] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> so will this be online matches as well for peak destruction?
[0:18:42] <%Juriasu> this is EXACTLY why I can't touch dbfz again (besides no rollback)
[0:18:43] <leith_aziz> I played DBFZ for a day again this week. Sadly, the game's neutral ended up being too frustrating for me. Stopping people from jumping all the time and superdashing got too much for me
[0:18:45] <andre11dr> I did test Piccolo, that shit seems insane
[0:18:53] <Shad0wTag> @kosorsomesaykosm_ we honestly have no idea yet
[0:18:55] <FacetiousAF> "oh cool there's some real killers with some ToD.... maybe i'll try it some day"
[0:19:03] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @Shad0wTag ah I see
[0:19:03] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:19:23] <+runegod20> did the new character for that come out yet?
[0:19:30] <+Volttreb> Regardless because of the way DBFZ plays its still fun for most skill levels
[0:19:48] <Shad0wTag> @leith_aziz Its definitely one of those things where you either get used to it or go insane. You get to press buttons and sometimes have no consequences
[0:19:53] <%townzzzzz> put on our BREST FIRE
[0:19:55] <%Juriasu> SourPls
[0:20:00] <Applecannon63> BREAST FIRE
[0:20:01] <dr_doriah> yea dbzf is fun at all levels. theres more than just tod-ing
[0:20:02] <andre11dr> Just remember that you have air block change now
[0:20:03] <%MTLer> oh God dbfz
[0:20:12] <blackkanye> SourPls
[0:20:13] <%Juriasu> damn the music in this game is so hype
[0:20:15] <dark_dmt_samurai> Lets go BOYZ
[0:20:17] <@Solidus_113> remember not to play the anime music if you have it to avoid copywrite
[0:20:21] <KazairLux> let's get our B R E A S T on boys
[0:20:22] <Applecannon63> oh no the jank menu
[0:20:27] <generalve> sucks this game is such a sasuge fest
[0:20:31] <Shad0wTag> @woolieversus We will be dunking Goku's right? lytKILLGOKU
[0:20:38] <+kevlarkoala> @dr_doriah maybe now? but that lack of anything beyond tod-ing is part of why it fell off
[0:20:54] <andre11dr> Time to get super E X P O S E D
[0:20:56] <+jessyg920> The new camera set up looks awesome
[0:21:10] <Applecannon63> Isn't Assist C nerfed?
[0:21:24] <+Volttreb> Are you guys on pad or stick?
[0:21:27] <+runegod20> assist C is like a solid 2 or so seconds longer to recharge I think?
[0:21:30] <Shad0wTag> @jessyg920 @applecannon63 Yes it takes like 15 seconds to come back
[0:21:34] <andre11dr> Yes C recovery is longer now
[0:21:37] <+alphonseisbest> @Applecannon63 yup 15 seconds
[0:21:37] <leith_aziz> @Applecannon63 Longer cooldown
[0:21:44] <dr_doriah> c assits recharge 3 times longer than a or b but track most of the time
[0:21:45] <+cinna2677> Sounds like a fight stick
[0:21:48] <%Drunkengen> its at a different place
[0:21:48] <andre11dr> C recovery is 15 seconds
[0:21:55] <+runegod20> i know they had new tutorials before for stuff added in one of the other seasons
[0:22:03] <+runegod20> like the patch that added the new assists and stuff
[0:22:13] <+nechallenger> The new tutorials are in a different spot
[0:22:18] <Shad0wTag> They have did new tutorials when they added EX's

[0:23:52] <+Rekinsinn> me neither
[0:23:53] <%townzzzzz> talk to them
[0:23:53] <Shad0wTag> Go to different characters to get different game play mechanics
[0:23:53] <%Sparkseid> talk to the diff characters
[0:23:55] <ElementalX1000> It's battle tutorials
[0:24:06] <infiltratian> is this like xenoverse where you can get mentors?
[0:24:15] <Shad0wTag> Every character represents different game play mechanics
[0:24:23] <andre11dr> I play this game and didn't know this shit existed
[0:24:28] <generalve> did they nerf 16 ?
[0:24:37] <Applecannon63> nah
[0:24:40] <leith_aziz> @generalve You mean now? No, he got some buffs
[0:24:40] <ElementalX1000> No this is the tutorial

[0:29:25] <+runegod20> every's old original assist are all now the A one, right?
[0:29:30] <Applecannon63> Super Jumping tho
[0:29:33] <DrkJP520> Penis head, man child and Arnold versus Reggie
[0:29:35] <Shad0wTag> @runegod20 Yeah
[0:29:38] <andre11dr> Yeah B is really good for roshi
[0:29:39] <mecromancersanonymous> You can always change the assists in the pause menu too
[0:29:43] <Helix_Snake> I always like getting into fighting games most when Woolie and Reggie are learning a game or characters for the first time
[0:29:43] <ShadowArcangel> "Deluxe Bomber" just sounds like something nice to be gifted
[0:29:58] <Applecannon63> @andre11dr I mean its Vegeta in his prime and PRIDE
[0:29:59] <+runegod20> it really does
[0:30:13] <%averyoddjew> averyoddjew subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months! just picked up strive and the hype has never been more real
[0:30:16] <RAH001> i love roshi theme but it takes so long to get to the hype part
[0:30:19] <Grim1952> Speaking of new mechanics, Adult Gohan goes ape shit now
[0:30:29] <infiltratian> oh man that's cool
[0:30:33] <lonosis47> Theyre really playing on dub?
[0:30:34] <+runegod20> wasn't adult gohan always kind of good?
[0:30:37] <@Solidus_113> oh god the bitrate NotLikeThis
[0:30:44] <+Makouzer> @WoolieVersus bitrate is a bit chonky
[0:30:53] <andre11dr> I fucked around with Freeza and his pretty insane now
[0:31:12] <andre11dr> Which i appreciate because he can struggle sometimes
[0:31:13] <@Solidus_113> ki blasts
[0:31:14] <Haarute> do a dragon rush after ki charge!
[0:31:18] <Applecannon63> Videl's Spot Dodge(Z Reflect) is fucking  nuts
[0:31:19] <Shad0wTag> @runegod20 yes now hes godlike
[0:31:25] <%Axle13j> Dragon Rush out of ki charge is hilarious now
[0:31:28] <Helix_Snake> the thing I always loved about this game is how the biggest jobber in DBZ (Yamcha) has consistently been top tier
[0:31:31] <Grim1952> It reflects blasts faster now and has dragon rush range extend
[0:31:35] <+runegod20> i'm pretty sure it either always was or got added like year 2, but now it just triggers faster
[0:31:37] <@Solidus_113> "useless"
[0:31:38] <%mr_sups> Dragon Rush, then Dragon Rush out of Ki Charge
[0:31:42] <ElementalX1000> Laugh
[0:31:49] <Yemmer> Dragon Rush while KI charging
[0:31:49] <%Sparkseid> do charge into rush
[0:32:01] <Shad0wTag> charge into rush is fullscreen
[0:32:03] <Haarute> dragon rush is like full screen now
[0:32:04] <primaryfire> it basically is a kara throw
[0:32:08] <blackkanye> Holy shit that dragon rush range
[0:32:12] <+Sajallday> not really
[0:32:13] <ShadowArcangel> You can do it on reaction to ki blasts, even on block
[0:32:15] <lonosis47> Ironic that woolie, the japanese dub elitist, is playing this game on dub. out of all things
[0:32:16] <Applecannon63> Ki charge is no longer usless with the follow up to Dragon rusg
[0:32:17] <andre11dr> It's given you a full screen throw mow
[0:32:17] <%MajorCrasher> it's Fullscreen pretty much
[0:32:21] <+Makouzer> kicharge deflects kiblasts frame 1 and increases rush range
[0:32:22] <+Sajallday> it's definitely a meme
[0:32:26] <Shad0wTag> Good luck 2M'ing that
[0:32:29] <%mr_sups> They did a bunch of stuff out of the Charge to make it better
[0:32:31] <generalve> dragon rush cheap yea or nay ?
[0:32:32] <andre11dr> It's just the rush
[0:32:35] <+runegod20> that was this update
[0:32:35] <%mr_sups> The Rush is new
[0:32:36] <Shad0wTag> thats new
[0:32:42] <Saikaboy> its not as good as you might htink
[0:32:44] <infiltratian> it's like a stance what the hell
[0:32:45] <%mr_sups> The Block Ki Blasts is older
[0:32:46] <Helix_Snake> is the confetti on this stage fucking up the compression lmao
[0:32:52] <+redyoshi5> ki charge can deflect projectiles as well
[0:32:54] <dr_doriah> yup. its new and it was buffing the ki blast buff already
[0:32:56] <%Axle13j> The new thing is that its better at deflecting ki blasts and now you got almost full screen throw
[0:33:01] <Saikaboy> the charge is ki blast immune, the dragon rush isnt
[0:33:03] <Grim1952> Nappa's minions are better too
[0:33:07] <andre11dr> @woolieversus You can block change in the air now
[0:33:10] <Shad0wTag> @helix_snake it is ruining it a little bit
[0:33:12] <primaryfire> ki charge now is frame 1 projectile invincible and can be done on block
[0:33:12] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1424943441079832577?s=19
[0:33:17] <+Makouzer> kicharge reflects kiblasts frame 1
[0:33:20] <+Jayleedurr> The dragon rush out of charge is new
[0:33:20] <Yemmer> holding S always superjumps
[0:33:29] <%Juriasu> Nappa is so thicc
[0:33:30] <andre11dr> Change
[0:33:31] <+LeaIsChill> Change Woolie
[0:33:32] <%mr_sups> CHANGE
[0:33:34] <ElementalX1000> "change"
[0:33:35] <andre11dr> not charge
[0:33:36] <vfrancolima> yoooo finally caught the stream live.
[0:33:37] <C_Apostrophe> block chaNge
[0:33:41] <%mr_sups> CHANGE not CHARGE
[0:33:41] <+Rekinsinn> alpha counter in the air
[0:33:43] <$Giothegame> They mean Guard Cancel
[0:33:44] <lonosis47> Do they not understand how the game works? lol
[0:33:44] <Applecannon63> Block change?
[0:33:46] <$Giothegame> Air Guard Cancel
[0:33:52] <lonosis47> Is this woolies first time playing dbfz or???
[0:33:55] <Applecannon63> Air Guard Cancel
[0:33:56] <+LeaIsChill> @lonosis47 There was a massive update last week
[0:33:57] <andre11dr> I wrote change
[0:33:58] <DrkJP520> sooorA
[0:34:07] <%Juriasu> yeah that was it
[0:34:11] <@Solidus_113> yeah it's S
[0:34:12] <primaryfire> @lonosis47 they are talking about changes that were JUST made to the game dude
[0:34:13] <Shad0wTag> holding makes super jump happen
[0:34:20] <%Axle13j> ^
[0:34:31] <Yemmer> holding S while jumping makes it a superjump
[0:34:32] <lonosis47> Yet they dont know how to dragon rush or z change, which have been in the game since day 1 "dude" @primaryfire
[0:34:37] <TheAlmightyCatGod> hold
[0:34:41] <Helix_Snake> shut your mouth
[0:34:45] <+CaptainPyron> Air Guard Cancel, Z Change from Specials, hold S for super jumps.
[0:34:47] <$Giothegame> Also if you hold up during a jump you float
[0:34:49] <+Rekinsinn> when special is held you super jump always
[0:34:56] <Shad0wTag> @lonosis47 they haven't played in  long time now
[0:35:04] <austinj24> Hold
[0:35:08] <+CaptainPyron> @WoolieVersus Hold S. Not press.
[0:35:10] <andre11dr> Hold
[0:35:28] <%Sparkseid> there ya go
[0:35:32] <lonosis47> woolie needs to go into the games basic tutorial asap
[0:35:36] <%MajorCrasher> @lonosis47 they obviously know how to, they're literally doing it. They're just testing out the changes
[0:35:38] <andre11dr> But you still have to do the instant dash
[0:35:42] <Yemmer> it also  works if you continue holding super dash after dashing
[0:35:54] <andre11dr> Do a dash right as you jump
[0:36:13] <+Makouzer> 2H universally sped up and increased invuln window
[0:36:14] <Grim1952> I heard it's good for rejumps mid combo
[0:36:28] <Shad0wTag> Its helpful for rejumps in combos @woolieversus
[0:36:41] <+CaptainPyron> It's more for stuff mid/after combos or from blockstun I'd say.
[0:36:54] <@Solidus_113> iirc tags on block still aren't free
[0:36:57] <lonosis47> FailFish
[0:36:58] <andre11dr> You get air mobility after super dash now
[0:37:10] <Shad0wTag> its takes 2 bars
[0:37:15] <%Sparkseid> costs 2 bars
[0:37:30] <Shad0wTag> its a free get off me tool
[0:37:39] <Grim1952> A hard read on that is devastating
[0:37:40] <infiltratian> wow that looks tight
[0:37:41] <Saikaboy> not exactly free now is it.
[0:37:48] <SunsetJack> A lot of head invul too.
[0:37:51] <@Solidus_113> not anymore
[0:37:54] <Demoli_PT> its not free and its not guaranteed since you can get called out super hard
[0:38:01] <@Solidus_113> you get a SHITLOAD of meter for doing specials now
[0:38:02] <@Menitta> Man I remember before E3 there was a rumor of an MHA game which never happened
[0:38:04] <Yemmer> if you know they are going to vanish out you can also vanish and get temp invincibility. sort of like a counter breaker
[0:38:13] <Saikaboy> think it was added as a countermeassure to hellzone setups.
[0:38:13] <Pookiedaexzile> Did I miss The Broly Stepping
[0:38:18] <Demoli_PT> or if you are doing gatlings you can 2H
[0:38:21] <$Giothegame> It's the same as Super Dash
[0:38:23] <Yemmer> forward and superdash
[0:38:26] <+Makouzer> same as superdash
[0:38:33] <Applecannon63> @solidus_113 you build more meter by doing the ex specials
[0:38:38] <C_Apostrophe> specials have been costing half a bar for a while now too
[0:38:43] <andre11dr> @woolieversus also now you get more meter during combos even if you start with an EX
[0:39:00] <ELFucilaNeroIV> holding S and jumping is the other macro
[0:39:10] <$Giothegame> If you can do a long enough come, you should see how much meter builds up in the latter part of it
[0:39:18] <+Makouzer> metergain is now determined more on how long combo lasts
[0:39:22] <Shad0wTag> sparking doesn't end while you do a combo it only ends once the combo is over @woolieversus
[0:39:23] <+MrKerb> MrKerb subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! Here is another month
[0:39:38] <+CaptainPyron> It's basically Fighterz 2 depending how long it's been since you played. lol
[0:39:46] <austinj24> It doesn't
[0:40:08] <$gfkxj> @WoolieVersus Les Go ultrakill Teaser for next layer Wrath just dropped
[0:40:21] <%Juriasu> hold her close
[0:40:21] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:40:29] <Shad0wTag> make lythero proud
[0:40:43] <Applecannon63> THERE IS NO ESCAPE
[0:40:59] <dr_doriah> do use J2H
[0:41:03] <Applecannon63> GIGANTIC FURY!
[0:41:03] <ELFucilaNeroIV> He has a 6H that you can combo into more stuff
[0:41:06] <Demoli_PT> you can keep doing 2m for them stomps
[0:41:09] <Shad0wTag> all you need is frieza and you already there
[0:41:18] <%Juriasu> the kamehameha dashes Kreygasm
[0:41:19] <andre11dr> @woolieversus also, you get air mobility after air specials now
[0:41:23] <+runegod20> it's still so nice to see all these characters with their original voices after all these years
[0:41:35] <Saikaboy> poor roshi gettin manhandled
[0:41:43] <lonosis47> Are they playing each other right now?
[0:41:44] <andre11dr> Bardock got some crazy shit
[0:41:44] <Applecannon63> broly's lvl 1 super has potential DHC
[0:41:55] <ELFucilaNeroIV> @woolieversus you can do 6H after his ex grab
[0:41:55] <ullyzeez> @lonosis47 yes
[0:41:58] <+CaptainPyron> @WoolieVersus Float properties after moves that leave your character airborne.
[0:42:11] <Yemmer> if you land Broly Lvl3 you get buffed
[0:42:29] <Applecannon63> lv3 is a install attack
[0:42:29] <andre11dr> Broly lvl 3 gives you a buff
[0:42:49] <+runegod20> i forget, does fighterz have a thing like injustice 2 did where they have mini tutorials for each character that explains the character design and the purposes of their moves

[0:42:50] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Super Broly is so dope
[0:42:50] <Grim1952> Z Broly is Legendary
[0:42:57] <%Juriasu> old broly is still cool
[0:42:58] <+Makouzer> lamer broly and cooler broly
[0:43:03] <+runegod20> since even though i never played it, that was something I always found cool about injustice 2
[0:43:08] <Shad0wTag> there is character tutorials
[0:43:13] <Applecannon63> Z Broly is kinda cool but his combo routes is meh
[0:43:14] <Buddha0991> @Makouzer no cooler is frieza's brother
[0:43:17] <lonosis47> @runegod20 it does and woolie needs to do them badly
[0:43:25] <$Giothegame> There's a whole zone now for learning the mechanics of the game
[0:43:26] <+CaptainPyron> These trials are pretty simple usually.
[0:43:26] <andre11dr> Should we tell them about Gogeta 4 ? or let them find out for themselves
[0:43:28] <Applecannon63> while Super Broly has better combo routes
[0:43:41] <+runegod20> like not just character trails, just 2 sentence text breakdowns
[0:43:46] <+CaptainPyron> It's just kinda a quick proof of concept for things.
[0:44:23] <+runegod20> yeah, this just seems like a basic trial
[0:44:28] <+notkojima> woolie just so you know these are all super unoptimal combos in a regular match, they are more to show you what's possible and some odd links
[0:44:36] <austinj24> Ex at close pops up
[0:44:43] <Yemmer> 2L for catch
[0:44:52] <lonosis47> Funny how chat was getting upset at me for saying woolie needs to do tutorial mode yet here we are LUL LUL Bruhh
[0:45:07] <+CaptainPyron> HS.
[0:45:17] <BackwardCap> 2m 5m is soft launch
[0:45:20] <+notkojima> toughest combo in the game
[0:45:25] <$Giothegame> I think you can change the button displays there
[0:45:30] <+CaptainPyron> H+S.
[0:45:30] <Yemmer> H+S
[0:45:35] <infiltratian> hardest anime game combo
[0:45:39] <%Juriasu> can't you change the notations?
[0:45:46] <+notkojima> larrFirsttry
[0:45:53] <BackwardCap> Also 5LL is a soft launch with Super Broly
[0:46:09] <DotoDoya> 349 raiders from DotoDoya have joined! 
[0:46:11] <+CaptainPyron> R1=L+M. R2=H+S.
[0:46:15] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Doto raid!
[0:46:16] <Aerodat> TRY SOMETHING
[0:46:19] <+CaptainPyron> Ah dang. Doto party!
[0:46:25] <BackwardCap> gildedNut
[0:46:26] <lonosis47> Bruhh
[0:46:26] <+notkojima> doto bayo!
[0:46:30] <Yemmer> oh shoot
[0:46:46] <+RD_NX> psaGib raid
[0:46:47] <andre11dr> That is not something you should do
[0:46:59] <andre11dr> This is very unoptimal
[0:47:11] <%Axle13j> ITS A RAID
[0:47:17] <@Solidus_113> don't worry about optimization
[0:47:18] <+SHEMPIMITE> dankes9Knightpog dankes9Knightpog dankes9Knightpog
[0:47:27] <Shad0wTag> Welcome raid!
[0:47:27] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:47:29] <%jinking79> oh shit doto
[0:47:29] <$Giothegame> Air super
[0:47:32] <+notkojima> we're being raided! flush the jetpacks!
[0:47:36] <Yemmer> right one just do it in the air
[0:47:38] <+SHEMPIMITE> psaBig psaBig psaBig
[0:47:39] <austinj24> Air
[0:47:44] <Shad0wTag> @solidus_113 I agree dude
[0:47:49] <37calorieghost> woolies been in the game for a while, I'm pretty sure my mans knows trials are unoptimal
[0:48:15] <Applecannon63> RTL
[0:48:16] <andre11dr> AWOOO
[0:48:17] <+TopTieramisu> ssj talbain
[0:48:30] <+notkojima> my favorite super broly quote
[0:48:31] <mecromancersanonymous> you can chain this into base goku spirit bomb
[0:48:38] <+notkojima> GAAAHHHH
[0:48:50] <andre11dr> I don't know man
[0:48:58] <andre11dr> I really YAAAAAAA
[0:49:01] <Demoli_PT> man the quality of the video goes to shit during these supers
[0:49:01] <generalve> are they playing this on PS4?
[0:49:02] <Yemmer> buffer in the super during the tp
[0:49:15] <Applecannon63> @toptieramisu I mean he is technically a were giant monkey
[0:49:39] <+notkojima> broly hug combo
[0:49:45] <@Solidus_113> @generalve yes
[0:49:51] <%ChickenSizzler> maybe wait to land before the ult?
[0:49:56] <andre11dr> Can't he just do down down down?
[0:49:59] <Grim1952> You're mashing into the second one maybe?
[0:50:06] <%ChickenSizzler> ahh
[0:50:19] <Applecannon63> If jon talbain was a cahin grappler that be sick as hell
[0:50:25] <%ChickenSizzler> THERE WE GOO
[0:50:26] <Applecannon63> *chain grappler
[0:50:58] <andre11dr> I'm pretty sure he can just keep doing down  down down
[0:51:18] <$Giothegame> Yes
[0:51:20] <PenGia> Yeah you need a second bar
[0:51:36] <jetstreamlove_R> yes second bar to pop the arial super
[0:51:45] <%jepupu> 18's dragon rush "SoraSoraSoraSora!" sounds so weird in English.
[0:52:09] <+LandOfTheWay> @andre11dr first hit might need to be a different direction depending on where the opponent is, but yeah generally two follow-up attacks going down will work and guarantee the level 2 hits
[0:53:11] <Yemmer> his jump cancels are actually pretty goofy
[0:53:18] <DrkJP520> @jepupu Indeed. Why would they do that?
[0:53:32] <lonosis47> deathuBrokeit
[0:54:14] <andre11dr> Is it just me or is it easier to remember combos when you look them up on YT than remembering the ones the game gives you?
[0:54:51] <leith_aziz> @jepupu Some characters say it like it's some sort of battlecry in JP (kinda like ORA!). Frieza says the same thing
[0:54:52] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:55:01] <Yemmer> no stand still just very specific
[0:55:03] <austinj24> Microdash?
[0:55:11] <lonosis47> Why didnt woolie do this before the stream
[0:55:26] <andre11dr> I actually like watching this
[0:55:31] <ElementalX1000> The point is to show the learning process
[0:55:38] <%MajorCrasher> ^
[0:55:40] <$Giothegame> They're both relearning the game chill
[0:55:45] <jetstreamlove_R> Yeah S Broly's trails are not fun to do
[0:55:52] <austinj24> Those ppl get it
[0:55:57] <Shad0wTag> @lonosis47 because its literally called get into fighting games???
[0:56:00] <lonosis47> So youre saying woolie doesnt know how to play Dbfz
[0:56:07] <andre11dr> Yes
[0:56:09] <PenGia> Yes
[0:56:09] <+CaptainPyron> Shows that even people super familiar with fighting games need to repeat things and get a feel for things.
[0:56:10] <%Sparkseid> yes
[0:56:18] <ECRead> I love getting SSJ4 lvl 7 confirms off of Broly command grab now
[0:56:23] <+Makouzer> he put it on break for a long while
[0:56:26] <+polothegreatest> how many brolys do you need? me: "YES" GlitchNRG
[0:56:49] <andre11dr> @lonosis47 The stream literally started with a joke about getting EXPOSED today
[0:57:08] <ECRead> "oh you blocked? you're dead now."
[0:57:24] <jetstreamlove_R> This trail wasn't thought through in the dev stage
[0:57:31] <lonosis47> Okay. earlier chat was making it seem like they were only here to check out the new changes. Bunch of idiots
[0:57:42] <Shad0wTag> @andre11dr its likes he's never seen someone relearn a game before
[0:57:45] <$gfkxj> I remember seeing day 1 Ultra Instinct Goku, and as a person that doesn't play many fighting games was like, the fuck is this character.
[0:57:59] <+LandOfTheWay> check the demo?
[0:58:12] <%Sparkseid> ^
[0:58:13] <blastazoid00> Is there a demo?
[0:58:13] <dr_doriah> demo
[0:58:19] <+LandOfTheWay> there we go
[0:58:20] <ECRead> there ya go
[0:58:24] <PenGia> Ayyyyy
[0:58:27] <blastazoid00> Thats so sick!
[0:58:27] <dr_doriah> aye we got those
[0:58:46] <andre11dr> I mean it's been a while since Ive touched this, last time i played it was when i learned Gogeta 4
[0:58:54] <+LandOfTheWay> yeah super broly has one of the best level 3s
[0:58:55] <DrkJP520> You can look at the CPU do the combo, fyi
[0:59:00] <andre11dr> I would play it more but the online sucks
[0:59:20] <andre11dr> Like you can't react to super dashing
[0:59:24] <Yemmer> 2l L
[0:59:27] <jetstreamlove_R> TBF no one uses Trail combo's they all suck and not even fun to do
[0:59:32] <Yemmer> 2L then L
[0:59:33] <+Makouzer> you can jumpcancel after L,L
[0:59:38] <andre11dr> plus the other BS this game brings
[1:00:18] <+LandOfTheWay> the trials are good for seeing what the characters' moves are and generally how they can combo, but yeah real combos are for finding in training mode/youtube
[1:00:21] <BackwardCap> Its 236 L
[1:00:39] <Shad0wTag> If you super don't love this game then you will find frustrating with opponents offense. Not even including the netcode
[1:01:04] <Qsmash_> you can say that about any game
[1:01:05] <Yemmer> His 2L is unique, try L,2L
[1:01:05] <ECRead> j.S works there
[1:01:15] <+Makouzer> this game is just marvel now lol
[1:01:23] <ECRead> instead of j.2H
[1:01:23] <+Makouzer> or maybe it always has been
[1:01:25] <andre11dr> I don't find defense frustrating in this game
[1:01:34] <+LandOfTheWay> funny enough playing this game got me in a good mindset for i-no in strive: never stop going in and never give your opponent time to think
[1:01:40] <ECRead> if you want to conserve smash
[1:01:50] <generalve> am I the only one thinking piccole grab is pointless ? you can't hit no matter how fast you press hit
[1:02:00] <generalve> the min he lets go
[1:02:00] <@Solidus_113> hey what's that meter at the very top above the infinite time limit?
[1:02:00] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1424943441079832577?s=19
[1:02:02] <andre11dr> What i hate is Tohan literally just mashing square and winning
[1:02:18] <+LandOfTheWay> @Solidus_113 indicator of who has the most team health
[1:02:19] <cornerstorecoroner> shows u whos winning @Solidus_113
[1:02:23] <@Solidus_113> neat
[1:02:36] <andre11dr> And that actually being the optimal way to play the caracter
[1:02:43] <RAH001> if u hide the u.i. and only show super broly doing his thing. u can totally show someone the footage and say its dbfz 2 if they never knew he was in the game. super broly just that crazy
[1:02:56] <Forkeye> glad to see woolie doing the thing
[1:03:15] <$gfkxj> Watching Ui Goku mario hop his way through a super is the dumbest shit I have ever seen
[1:03:25] <dr_doriah> "let me take your stick" "PHRASING!!!"
[1:03:27] <andre11dr> Oh god ,Roshi is even harder to learn
[1:03:38] <Shad0wTag> Roshi is not easy
[1:03:55] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Roshi is the technical character.
[1:03:59] <ECRead> cumjar super yes
[1:04:00] <andre11dr> Wait so Woolie never found out about the lvl 3 buff didn't he?
[1:04:08] <%OtakuSnake1> Get in the jar indeed
[1:04:09] <Shad0wTag> that forces a chang right chat?
[1:04:15] <Yemmer> ot also swaps you out and locks the character for a bit
[1:04:16] <Shad0wTag> *change
[1:04:26] <+LandOfTheWay> yeah, just damage boost
[1:04:27] <ECRead> 5% damage up, yes
[1:04:27] <+thegamekirby98> 10% damage increase iirc
[1:04:30] <ELFucilaNeroIV> 10% damage boost IIRC
[1:04:33] <%Irridium> It was many moons ago when I still played
[1:04:35] <+Makouzer> wait its more than just a ripped shirt?
[1:04:36] <ECRead> is it 10 now?
[1:04:39] <andre11dr> Yes
[1:04:45] <+Makouzer> what even lol
[1:05:00] <+TopTieramisu> mafuuba
[1:05:01] <andre11dr> It's 10% indeed
[1:05:10] <ECRead> ok neat it use to just be 5
[1:05:24] <ELFucilaNeroIV> That has armor
[1:06:21] <DrkJP520> Fun fact: "Roshi" means "old master" in Japanese, so "Master Roshi" makes little sense.
[1:06:21] <ELFucilaNeroIV> he really is
[1:06:46] <mecromancersanonymous> Thunder shock suprise is unblockable too
[1:06:49] <PackitupPaul> I believe you have to jump it
[1:06:52] <presidentpun> KAPOW
[1:07:02] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Thunder shock is unblockable
[1:07:04] <+LandOfTheWay> yeah, roshi is really damn technical, but he can do some wacky shit if you can get past the learning curve
[1:07:18] <%mr_sups> Command Grab
[1:07:22] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[1:07:22] <ELFucilaNeroIV> LUL
[1:07:24] <%Sparkseid> LUL
[1:07:27] <algi80> LUL
[1:07:32] <Aganok_> schleeep
[1:07:40] <dr_doriah> roshi is so gangster lmao
[1:07:55] <andre11dr> That's unblockeble too
[1:07:55] <ECRead> I love Roshi, but I could never get used to him
[1:08:03] <Norrdicus> "wee"
[1:08:14] <aircitystudios> The classic Dragon Ball love they put into his moveset, shoutout to Jackie Chun! XD
[1:08:20] <+CaptainPyron> Hold.
[1:08:25] <Yemmer> you can just hold it
[1:08:26] <DrkJP520> I hope he doesn't do that to any girls
[1:08:30] <+the22cstomp> Roshiori
[1:08:41] <%MajorCrasher> monkaW @drkjp520
[1:08:48] <bearwagon> LUL
[1:08:51] <Applecannon63> Tbh I kinda wish Roshi had some Oro moves
[1:08:52] <ECRead> he's super complex
[1:08:52] <%Sparkseid> LUL
[1:08:56] <andre11dr> Who has the most moves, probably Blue Gogeta right?
[1:08:57] <j3sharp> COWARD
[1:09:01] <ELFucilaNeroIV> I recommend Super Baby
[1:09:01] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:09:04] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> fear [installed]
[1:09:11] <Afrosamasenpai> You got this Reggie!
[1:09:16] <Shad0wTag> Android 21 Reggie, you know you should
[1:09:21] <+Makouzer> too much
[1:09:21] <%Sparkseid> woolieMIRIN
[1:09:23] <%ozzrabbit> Do Master Roshi’s moves/lines change when he’s fighting female characters?
[1:09:23] <mecromancersanonymous> lmaoooo
[1:09:25] <@Solidus_113> gg
[1:09:25] <+UberWolfman> COWARD LUL
[1:09:27] <%eyezehuhh> eyezehuhh subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! I'm way intimidated to get back into dbfz! I played it when it released but fizzled out. this stream was a helpful refresher to get back in. cheers!
[1:09:28] <j3sharp> COWARD
[1:09:28] <Haarute> reggie's brain imploded
[1:09:30] <generalve> coward
[1:09:30] <Meltgar> REGGIE = Q U I T Kappa
[1:09:41] <andre11dr> Yeah his complicated, just do like everyone else and play Vegeta LUL
[1:09:44] <%jepupu> I thought this was the "easy" game.
[1:09:45] <BackwardCap> His name is "MASTER" Roshi OWLSombra
[1:09:47] <+LandOfTheWay> can't handle the turtle school
[1:09:49] <Applecannon63> Like Madter Roshi could do some chicken kick like Oro
[1:09:50] <RAH001> when they released him i wanted him to have his normal drip and his back in the day with hair drip
[1:09:54] <Yemmer> Maybe Super Baby 2 is more his speed? some depth but not crazy
[1:09:55] <generalve> ANDROID 17 Is complex and stupid
[1:09:55] <+RD_NX> NotLikeThis
[1:09:56] <Grim1952> Check out Base Vegeta, he caught your attention already
[1:09:58] <%therustystream> Roshi is a different game entierely
[1:10:00] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Super Baby 2 might be your speed
[1:10:03] <mecromancersanonymous> you might enjoy ui goku
[1:10:03] <andre11dr> Should gon with Vegeta LUL
[1:10:04] <ElementalX1000> Turtle Style
[1:10:07] <%jepupu> Do they still have base Vegeta's corner loops that get screwed by netcode delay changes?
[1:10:13] <%therustystream> Roshi might as well be from a different game lol
[1:10:13] <rtemis223> Exact reason I can't play Skullgirls.
[1:10:13] <@Solidus_113> the true final boss
[1:10:20] <Qsmash_> the monkey king
[1:10:20] <Meltgar> Yeap, skullgirls is like that
[1:10:24] <%Sparkseid> the BOY
[1:10:24] <%OtakuSnake1> SSJ4 is pimpin'
[1:10:27] <andre11dr> Oh Reggie would love UI
[1:10:28] <cipher758> the monke
[1:10:28] <@Solidus_113> free dragon balls
[1:10:30] <Applecannon63> @generalve but he's a rekka fighter how complicated
[1:10:30] <Yemmer> this character was designed to be busted
[1:10:32] <Grim1952> 7 taunts and lvl 3 is death
[1:10:36] <+Makouzer> Roshi should be worth 2 characters
[1:10:37] <Yemmer> I love it
[1:10:38] <jetstreamlove_R> finish sign
[1:10:40] <Meltgar> Everyone getting infinite combos, and i'm like, L M that's it Kappa
[1:10:48] <andre11dr> Yeah 7 taunt is an IK
[1:10:49] <Applecannon63> finish sign
[1:10:52] <Pookiedaexzile> Nonsense in GT no way Kappa
[1:10:54] <LoadingFWANK> look at that hannibal kick
[1:10:58] <BackwardCap> 5'11 vs 6ft
[1:11:00] <+LandOfTheWay> @generalve as a dedicated 17 player, he's not too bad. just mix up the order of his rekka every now and then and very rarely use his air jumps
[1:11:04] <Applecannon63> finish sign is his command normal
[1:11:04] <andre11dr> And you can make taunt an assist
[1:11:11] <%therustystream> IT IS
[1:11:11] <%Sparkseid> Kappa
[1:11:13] <ELFucilaNeroIV> It is
[1:11:15] <a_deadbeat> that's an overhead
[1:11:17] <Haarute> it is
[1:11:18] <ElementalX1000> Block this overhead
[1:11:19] <ShadowArcangel> ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?
[1:11:19] <%jepupu> Who the f thought it was a good idea to name a manly evil-looking character SUPER BABY 2?
[1:11:20] <DrkJP520> The double voice was Toriyama's idea originally.
[1:11:29] <%therustystream> IT HAS A DOWN FORWARD FOLLOW UP TOO TO GO LOW
[1:11:33] <ELFucilaNeroIV> And 3H is another follow up
[1:11:37] <andre11dr> It's totally an overhead
[1:11:54] <andre11dr> THIS CARACTER IS DIRTY
[1:11:54] <Shad0wTag> I@jepupu In his defence he was called Baby, it was never gonna not sound weird
[1:12:20] <ECRead> lvl 7 can now confirm off of any other character's special moves. including command grabs.
[1:12:34] <andre11dr> You land one comand throw with full level, say goodbye to your caracter
[1:12:52] <+polothegreatest> final boss sg4
[1:12:52] <Applecannon63> bluff kamehameha is a command grab

[1:12:54] <JairusHopesItWorks> double air dash right too right?
[1:13:00] <andre11dr> Yes
[1:13:01] <ECRead> yep
[1:13:08] <BackwardCap> That level 1 makes the Swotch version go down to 10fps gildedSmug
[1:13:14] <andre11dr> He gets two air dashes for some reason
[1:13:20] <@Solidus_113> FILTH
[1:13:23] <+patel347> two people
[1:13:28] <Shad0wTag> @backwardcap give us that switch tech
[1:13:32] <ELFucilaNeroIV> You can but you gotta
[1:13:35] <ELFucilaNeroIV> jump
[1:13:44] <Applecannon63> that second Ultimate Impact is Sol's og Riot stamp
[1:13:47] <andre11dr> You get 3 cross ups because main caracter
[1:13:57] <jetstreamlove_R> Adult Gohan gets double dash at lvl3 install
[1:14:08] <BackwardCap> @shad0wtag Buy modded controller woth dpad or die gildedNut
[1:14:09] <DrkJP520> do you have triple jump?
[1:14:09] <%Sparkseid> ^
[1:14:11] <%therustystream> I love his command normal overhead string
[1:14:16] <ECRead> no triple
[1:14:21] <%Sparkseid> aw
[1:14:22] <ElementalX1000> Oh right A Gohan is a boss character now
[1:14:47] <Shad0wTag> @elementalx1000 Dragon Install to TOD  a character
[1:14:55] <%therustystream> rekka into ki blast
[1:15:05] <Applecannon63> plus energy of jutice is his DP
[1:15:10] <sunnythedrunk> adult gohan
[1:15:17] <sunnythedrunk> has a dark phoenix gameplan
[1:15:28] <+LandOfTheWay> apparently golden frieza can maintain his form by switching out and getting kills, so he can stay like that if the player is skilled, which i guess makes him a pseudo-boss character as well
[1:15:32] <%Sparkseid> the dragon ball move
[1:15:36] <Grim1952> That new lvl 7 unlocked potential is crazy
[1:15:39] <andre11dr> Yeah i saw what they did with Adult Gohan
[1:15:41] <%therustystream> that's weird
[1:15:51] <Shad0wTag> @landoftheway lytFILTH
[1:15:58] <%Sparkseid> faster
[1:16:03] <jetstreamlove_R> lvl7 Install Gohan is just Sparking whitout sparking damage
[1:16:03] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:16:18] <+Yamchadassist> the glow is a dp and it gives you a dragonball
[1:16:34] <jetstreamlove_R> lvl7 Install turns him into a god!
[1:16:36] <andre11dr> To be fair i feel like that's what lvl 7 unlocked potential should've been
[1:16:41] <%jepupu> Hyper fighting games are kind of like rhythm game rap battles. It's your turn if they drop their rhymes
[1:16:50] <emeraldskrull> SSJ5>>>>SSJ(insert color) facts
[1:16:55] <andre11dr> It was kinda of a waste to go all the way to 7 before
[1:17:00] <Shad0wTag> @jepupu Thats a good analogy
[1:17:18] <BlackermanZX> can gogeta still combo his instant kill
[1:17:21] <ELFucilaNeroIV> That move is plus
[1:17:32] <Applecannon63> Lightning hammer more like LARIAT
[1:17:33] <BackwardCap> Cross up too I think
[1:17:34] <andre11dr> @blackermanzx Oh hell yeah
[1:17:34] <+LandOfTheWay> @BlackermanZX yep
[1:17:41] <Shad0wTag> @blackermanzx yes and now he has more options
[1:17:50] <andre11dr> He can combo into it really easily
[1:17:58] <Applecannon63> Dude gets a Lariat
[1:18:02] <BlackermanZX> gawd damn
[1:18:21] <andre11dr> You can fake kamehameha into the IK
[1:18:39] <andre11dr> Also the overhead
[1:18:51] <andre11dr> And the punch move
[1:19:04] <jetstreamlove_R> now do it whit lvl 7 finish sign into ult
[1:19:12] <Shad0wTag> you need 7
[1:19:13] <+aBoner89> Kreygasm 1 finger?
[1:19:14] <andre11dr> He can pretty much do it from every special LUL
[1:19:14] <generalve> what the fuck ,?
[1:19:20] <+UberWolfman> LUL
[1:19:21] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[1:19:21] <Grim1952> You need to taunt 7 times, no need for 7 bars
[1:19:24] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[1:19:26] <%Mrthefro> Sending the bitrate to hell
[1:19:27] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> womp
[1:19:32] <Applecannon63> DESTROYED!
[1:19:37] <ELFucilaNeroIV> You can do it after dp
[1:19:41] <%jepupu> Try what-ing this now, young man?
[1:19:49] <andre11dr> It takes 3 bars
[1:19:53] <%Sparkseid> DP into Ultra
[1:19:53] <Yemmer> you can do it in a combo
[1:19:54] <@Solidus_113> not 7 meter, 7 taunts
[1:19:56] <Shad0wTag> you can after bluff kamehameha
[1:20:02] <Zombrocom> You can only do it with 7 taunts
[1:20:05] <%therustystream> level 7 finish sign
[1:20:07] <jetstreamlove_R> 7 taunt
[1:20:13] <Demoli_PT> no
[1:20:15] <Demoli_PT> just normal level 3
[1:20:18] <Applecannon63> 7 taunts=Level 7
[1:20:31] <+LandOfTheWay> you can do it on the ground
[1:20:32] <%CaptainPileDriver> ah shit
[1:20:37] <Demoli_PT> you can also do it on the ground
[1:20:42] <%CaptainPileDriver> we doin lobby matches yet for dbfz or what
[1:20:45] <austinj24> Normal lvl3 is a thing
[1:20:49] <aircitystudios> You good Reggie? XD
[1:20:50] <%CaptainPileDriver> just got here
[1:20:50] <ELFucilaNeroIV> He can do it from a vanish
[1:20:51] <@Solidus_113> GGs shake my hand LUL
[1:20:53] <Grim1952> But this can be done multiple times
[1:20:54] <BlackermanZX> yeah he has an IK LUL
[1:20:54] <PackitupPaul> if you don't have all the taunts it's just a normal level 3
[1:20:57] <%CaptainPileDriver> this is free though
[1:20:58] <Applecannon63> DESTROYED
[1:20:59] <Shad0wTag> lytKILLGOKU
[1:20:59] <ECRead> oh yes
[1:21:06] <Haarute> he has an assist where he taunts and gets a level, up to 5
[1:21:07] <BackwardCap> Yeah, but you cant combo into 16s gildedThink
[1:21:14] <Demoli_PT> one of his assists just builds that
[1:21:15] <Applecannon63> 16 is the original DESTROYED
[1:21:16] <generalve> wait
[1:21:18] <andre11dr> You can set the taunt as an assist @woolieversus
[1:21:19] <@Solidus_113> !uptime
[1:21:19] <@Moobot> @Solidus_113 WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 35 minutes
[1:21:27] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Kappa
[1:21:29] <jetstreamlove_R> yeah but 16 does it easy in exchange for his health bar LUL
[1:21:33] <+aBoner89> just win 4Head
[1:21:33] <@Solidus_113> oh yeah, you can totally set the taunt as the assist
[1:21:34] <ShadowArcangel> Reggie will figure it out
[1:21:38] <Yemmer> try Baby 2, hes got depth but he's easy to pick up
[1:21:42] <$Giothegame> They check out level 7 Adult Gohan?
[1:21:50] <andre11dr> Just pick UI you WILL WIN
[1:21:54] <%CaptainPileDriver> you also get a fuck ton of meter for that taunt as assist
[1:21:56] <Applecannon63> Super Baby got slightly nerfed
[1:22:06] <%CaptainPileDriver> and if you combine that with base goku meter assist then yeah
[1:22:06] <BackwardCap> I thought Reggie tapped out of Roshi sajamSol
[1:22:06] <Vyneci> I BETTER see a Hit Lv 7 in this stream
[1:22:09] <BlackermanZX> playing UI is like playing vergil in mvc3
[1:22:19] <Tunamanguy> nappa time
[1:22:20] <%jepupu> Pink gang.
[1:22:21] <Applecannon63> apparently baby's ki attacks of nerfed
[1:22:21] <%CaptainPileDriver> YEYEYE NAPPA MAINS RISE UP
[1:22:28] <jetstreamlove_R> his finish revolves how much damage his supers will do unfortunately it will reset if you do any supers
[1:22:32] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Nappa is way better now
[1:22:33] <DrkJP520> west city. best song
[1:22:41] <%jepupu> I still want Raditz, so I can pick him, Nappa and base Vegeta.
[1:22:46] <Yemmer> UI is moral like Strive Sol, he doesn't have anything insanely busted but everything he has is just better
[1:22:48] <+LandOfTheWay> i love hit, but i could never get the hang of him to the extent of working him into a team properly
[1:22:53] <%MajorCrasher> oh yeah ssj4 Gogeta and ssj god Gogeta have a dramatic finish together
[1:22:57] <%CaptainPileDriver> 16 still got some good stuff
[1:22:57] <Shad0wTag> Oh he can dude
[1:23:05] <ECRead> u2
[1:23:05] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:23:06] <BackwardCap> We got 1 stage since the launch of DBFZ sajamDelay
[1:23:07] <andre11dr> I wish they added more stages
[1:23:14] <ELFucilaNeroIV> 16 still can dunk, not like S1 but he can still do some stuff
[1:23:24] <ShadowArcangel> The squad
[1:23:29] <+SilverInferno3> I was hoping for an ice stage like the Super Broly movie had
[1:23:30] <@Solidus_113> 1 dunk
[1:23:30] <jetstreamlove_R> Th dunk master
[1:23:31] <+azraith> The little things in this game are what make it really cool.  All of the custom intros, etc
[1:23:34] <+Lordkeyblade> has woolie seen the broken Cell glitches LUL LUL
[1:23:39] <Shad0wTag> @backwardcap Its a shame
[1:23:48] <generalve> BODY SLAM
[1:23:58] <%CaptainPileDriver> now chat, is anyone gonna be brave enough to get the gotenks glitch on stream?
[1:24:02] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[1:24:02] <+inkandamber> Bit rate...LOL
[1:24:12] <Grim1952> Stuck out with Roshi in the end?
[1:24:14] <ittalulu> this game is still too nuts for me
[1:24:17] <Shad0wTag> @captainpiledriver I keep hearing about this and it sounds nightmarish
[1:24:18] <andre11dr> Yeah the new tag mechanic left Piccolo looking kinda broken
[1:24:34] <@Solidus_113> the raw tags
[1:25:00] <jetstreamlove_R> god dunk
[1:25:01] <%jepupu> Raw lv.3 is all blue damage
[1:25:15] <Applecannon63> If only Super Broly's Charge attack had a barrier buff like Z Broly's…
[1:25:24] <jetstreamlove_R> time to make the donuts
[1:25:36] <Qsmash_> the saibamen buffs are great for Nappa
[1:25:37] <%jepupu> Nappa's 5H is really good
[1:25:54] <@Solidus_113> bitrate containment wave
[1:25:56] <andre11dr> Oh no animation
[1:26:21] <Pt_Kamen> No Gokus?
[1:26:28] <jetstreamlove_R> dragon rush gets extended if you charge first into dragon rush
[1:26:37] <Applecannon63> BROLY GET NAKED
[1:26:40] <andre11dr> We don't do Gokus around here
[1:26:42] <BlackermanZX> shirt off buff is cool
[1:26:45] <+LandOfTheWay> i wish more character got unique explosion colors like 21
[1:26:57] <BackwardCap> Yes
[1:27:00] <@Solidus_113> Hit's so fucking cool
[1:27:07] <%Sparkseid> indeed
[1:27:07] <%jepupu> You can still DP if you have one
[1:27:10] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> only the crunchiest bitrate this side of the fgc
[1:27:36] <%jepupu> LLL L LLL combos all the way
[1:27:37] <jetstreamlove_R> Le dunk
[1:27:42] <andre11dr> It's honestly wierd that only 21 gets the pink explosion ,you'd think Kid Buu would get it as well
[1:27:58] <DrkJP520> I wanna see some Shen Long summons.
[1:28:15] <Applecannon63> Still bummed that Android 16's still doesn't super armor
[1:28:31] <jetstreamlove_R> hit whit the classic
[1:28:59] <GenericSoda> GRAPPLED
[1:29:04] <BackwardCap> MASHIN gildedNut
[1:29:10] <Thunderhog> lytKILLGOKU
[1:29:13] <GenericSoda> @BackwardCap sajamDegen
[1:29:14] <andre11dr> I'm surprised that milk toast boy Reggie isn't playing one Goku
[1:29:20] <ECRead> Reggie'd probably like Piccolo I think
[1:29:22] <+LandOfTheWay> i'm thinking i might try out a secondary team of Hit, Beerus, and S.Broly. think i could make that order work
[1:29:26] <sunnythedrunk> If Reggie had one nappa combo FeelsBadMan
[1:29:32] <@Solidus_113> remember the ki charge changes, and sparking
[1:29:32] <+Ricky_Rexx> TURTLE POWER
[1:29:32] <GenericSoda> My baaaaaack!
[1:29:55] <%jepupu> 2H if you expect a character switch -> superdash -> aircombo -> vanish -> throw and force the changed-out person back
[1:29:59] <fatlystackedmac> fuckin gottem
[1:30:04] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> old man = bullied
[1:30:10] <%kewlmyc> DID SOMEONE SAY DESTRY GOKU!?
[1:30:10] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1424943441079832577?s=19
[1:30:11] <%jepupu> Forces the blue life out too
[1:31:47] <andre11dr> Chat what is your favorite Broly quote? mine is YYYYAAAAAAAAAHHHH
[1:31:57] <%jepupu> Looking at this makes me wanna play again. Why, why didn't they change the netcode?
[1:32:14] <+Das_Prints> Is hit any good these days? He was one of the few I liked playing back when the game first came out.
[1:32:22] <leith_aziz> @jepupu Is that a serious question or are you mostly venting?
[1:32:30] <+Ricky_Rexx> @andre11dr That's an iconic one, personally I like RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGH
[1:32:31] <mecromancersanonymous> Hits great
[1:32:37] <Grim1952> I got a few favorites from the real Broly, but from Super Broly...
[1:32:45] <Applecannon63> @jepupu expensive
[1:32:45] <%jepupu> @jepupu yes to both.
[1:32:50] <leith_aziz> @Das_Prints I think he's ok. His weakness is mostly that his buttons are weird and that he's a technical character
[1:32:52] <+Prowtellen> purple piccolo is pretty cool
[1:33:01] <+Das_Prints> @mecromancersanonymous Nice to hear.
[1:33:02] <andre11dr> @ricky_rexx Ah yes, the classic choice
[1:33:28] <+Ricky_Rexx> Hit's so cool in this I forget he literally has King Crimson powers
[1:33:39] <@Solidus_113> RAAAAGH
[1:33:40] <passserby> inspirational quote
[1:33:53] <+Das_Prints> @leith_aziz Good to know. I remember he had so really slow lows but some really cool looking combos. Thanks.
[1:33:57] <BlackermanZX> no need for IQ when you have unga
[1:34:04] <%Mrthefro> "Just relax dude" the Broly story
[1:34:20] <leith_aziz> @jepupu Arcsys can't retrofit rollback to FighterZ both because of the amount or work required to do it this late into the game's lifecycle, and Bamco has to give the OK since they own the propety, and you know how Bandai Namco games online are
[1:34:36] <+Ricky_Rexx> I want to get more into this game, how important is team comp in terms of all characters having good move syngergy? Could I just choose three characters I like individually and work with that or is that not viable?
[1:35:02] <andre11dr> Man im looking at the caracter select screen right now, i forgot Chefla exists LUL
[1:35:04] <leith_aziz> @Ricky_Rexx You are not playing at high level. dont worry about it
[1:35:16] <LoadingFWANK> pick who you want
[1:35:24] <GenericSoda> @Ricky_Rexx in general some synergy works, but until you start playing at a high leve, play who you enjoy. I'd even argue that at a high level you should play what you enjoy
[1:35:35] <andre11dr> She has cool looking gameplay but her design is so....unmemorable
[1:35:51] <%CaptainPileDriver> man, that gotenks glitch is a pain in the ass to get
[1:35:56] <%jepupu> @jepupu Can't really play this anymore then, thanks to living in a sparsely populated European country. Not enough people to play with within reasonable range for the online to work
[1:35:58] <sunnythedrunk> Between the 3 assists most comps work anyway
[1:36:02] <+polothegreatest> theres no dbfz2 nor tekken 8 sipsipGears
[1:36:14] <leith_aziz> @CaptainPileDriver I saw the Cell spindashing infinite. That made me chuckle
[1:36:15] <+Ricky_Rexx> think we'll ever get a dbfz 2?
[1:36:30] <Applecannon63> I wish Kefle adopted Kale's Super Broly look
[1:36:33] <GenericSoda> @Ricky_Rexx it sold well enough that I'd expect it to
[1:36:36] <sunnythedrunk> Dbfz 2 will probably be like 2025 at the earliest
[1:36:39] <+polothegreatest> first u get the money
[1:36:41] <leith_aziz> @Ricky_Rexx Im not sure if im being honest. Depends on if Bamco wants too make more money
[1:36:47] <ElementalX1000> Butoden got a sequel I don't see why not
[1:36:47] <andre11dr> @polothegreatest Wait, that both Namco, i think there's a conspiracy to be had here
[1:36:51] <leith_aziz> *wants to
[1:37:01] <GenericSoda> INTO LEVEL 3
[1:37:09] <%CaptainPileDriver> the only other thing i want someone to do, is hit the instant kill with gogeta or 16 or hit the body change
[1:37:13] <%Sparkseid> STEVE MY ARM
[1:37:13] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:37:15] <sunnythedrunk> 18 level 3 is the sickest
[1:37:27] <epsypepsy> got em
[1:37:38] <Shad0wTag> Do you think in a theoretical Fighterz 2, Bandai Namco would even let Arc Sys let them add rollback?
[1:37:40] <+Das_Prints> They just fixed that screen and they go and break it agsin
[1:37:41] <+esoteric_simp> ggs lads this is a good watch
[1:37:42] <andre11dr> I just want to hit Woolie with UI bullshit
[1:37:44] <%Zero_Jacks> lytKILLGOKU lytKILLGOKU lytKILLGOKU
[1:37:46] <+Ricky_Rexx> I really like how Hit feels more like a boxer compared to the normal martial arts style dbz characters have
[1:37:55] <andre11dr> He deserves it for playing Vergil
[1:38:00] <GenericSoda> @Shad0wTag if they handled development, I don't see any reason why they wouldn't
[1:38:05] <leith_aziz> @Shad0wTag Depends on who stubborn one could be. I see no reason NOT to let them put rollback
[1:38:09] <Applecannon63> Like Kefla's design would've kept Kale's Broly form
[1:38:10] <leith_aziz> *hoow
[1:38:22] <austinj24> Get 16d
[1:38:35] <%jepupu> Old god tier SSJ2 rank tech: Jump back and chicken block all the time, superdash when they try to rush
[1:38:37] <+Ricky_Rexx> Kefla's design is so weak idc if you like the character herself you have to admit
[1:38:45] <Shad0wTag> @leith_aziz If Harada is anything to go by and how he thinks I figured he would insist its not worth it
[1:39:06] <@Menitta> There is an art to good COUNTER sound effects
[1:39:12] <+polothegreatest> kfla is half broly, so..
[1:39:14] <leith_aziz> Man, I would not be surprised if Tekken 8 comes out and the netcode is the same
[1:39:16] <sunnythedrunk> Kefla design is weak but dbfz made her cool af to play
[1:39:23] <andre11dr> Kefla is just yoga pants girl, she's so generic she looks out of place
[1:39:27] <Applecannon63> @ricky_rexx you know what's missing to the design? she doesn't have the crossiant shoulders
[1:39:35] <Shad0wTag> @leith_aziz that will absolutely happen
[1:39:42] <Ardisan_> Jirens design is awful
[1:39:55] <sunnythedrunk> yeah Jiren is so generic
[1:39:57] <austinj24> Saiba spit moved you lol
[1:40:00] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> reggie
[1:40:04] <leith_aziz> @Ardisan_ To be fair, Jiren makes me think of Omniman, so taht's a positive
[1:40:05] <sunnythedrunk> and his powers are hella generic lookiing
[1:40:06] <Shad0wTag> @sunnythedrunk Probably doesn't help her outfit is a fusion of one okay design and one kinda eh design so it coulda been worse
[1:40:12] <leith_aziz> *that's
[1:40:22] <andre11dr> Zamasu is also wierd but at least i remember him
[1:40:22] <sunnythedrunk> @Shad0wTag true
[1:40:28] <%jepupu> Superdash after 2H always
[1:40:32] <+Ricky_Rexx> @Applecannon63 Maybe that is what it is
[1:40:34] <leith_aziz> I think Zamasu looks nice
[1:40:37] <+Das_Prints> The boot
[1:40:38] <Pt_Kamen> put Hit's song
[1:40:49] <+HungryHungryEmu> why are we even worried about keflas design lmao, videl is literally in a tshirt and shorts
[1:40:50] <leith_aziz> @Pt_Kamen ^
[1:40:51] <%jepupu> Goku Blanco
[1:40:53] <ELFucilaNeroIV> OH SHIT
[1:40:57] <+Ricky_Rexx> I don't entirely hate Jiren as a character, but again, just such a bland design
[1:40:58] <+polothegreatest> LUL LUL
[1:40:59] <+HungryHungryEmu> just say u dont like super and move on lmao
[1:40:59] <sunnythedrunk> Beerus, Hit, Super broly, goku black def the gems of super designs
[1:40:59] <ElementalX1000> el grande padre
[1:41:00] <BlackermanZX> of course reggie is picking vergil
[1:41:03] <%CaptainPileDriver> he's still fucked
[1:41:04] <%Zero_Jacks> Dunk the Goku woolz lytKILLGOKU
[1:41:05] <ELFucilaNeroIV> The menace
[1:41:08] <andre11dr> YES

[1:41:08] <+Ricky_Rexx> DA BABY?
[1:41:12] <austinj24> Baby B
[1:41:12] <Shad0wTag> @hungryhungryemu and we all love Videl for it
[1:41:12] <%CaptainPileDriver> between him and the god damn RAT
[1:41:18] <ELFucilaNeroIV> DA BABY !
[1:41:20] <andre11dr> EMBRACE THE DARK SIDE
[1:41:27] <Miles_Stardiver> Looking like Wolverine
[1:41:30] <sunnythedrunk> Baby B gives you your oppoenets assist
[1:41:35] <dds333a> I PULL UP
[1:41:36] <sunnythedrunk> after you kill them
[1:41:36] <Pt_Kamen> HIT's SONG
[1:41:38] <Applecannon63> @hungryhungryemu Videl gets a pass only grip is the whole hair debate
[1:41:39] <@Solidus_113> DUN
[1:41:43] <leith_aziz> Super Baby looks way too much like an X-men character
[1:41:43] <ELFucilaNeroIV> you might dig Baby
[1:41:44] <BlackermanZX> SPAYCEE
[1:41:47] <+chase959> grown gohan is powerful with his lvl installs
[1:41:47] <+Ricky_Rexx> Woah baby is ultra instinct too? oh  no just naturally white hair
[1:41:49] <andre11dr> No chat, i don't think Super Baby hates gays
[1:41:50] <sunnythedrunk> Baby B
[1:41:54] <%kewlmyc> bABY b
[1:41:55] <BlackermanZX> Baby B
[1:41:57] <+pearsnickety> >Broly B
[1:41:58] <Shad0wTag> He steals assists
[1:42:09] <Applecannon63> Baby B
[1:42:11] <+Ricky_Rexx> That's cool and in character for him
[1:42:21] <Applecannon63> like jeeguz the typos
[1:42:36] <andre11dr> Baby despite looking ridiculous, has some really cool shit
[1:42:38] <@Solidus_113> reading is hard sometimes
[1:42:41] <Miles_Stardiver> Watching all this reminds me how badly I need to work on my air game in fighting games
[1:42:42] <+pearsnickety> Haven't touched the game since around release, how is NuBroly compared to OldBroly?

[1:43:02] <+HungryHungryEmu> z broly is top 3 in game
[1:43:07] <leith_aziz> @pearsnickety Super Brooly? He's Ok. Z Broly on the other hand only got better and better
[1:43:09] <dds333a> OG Broly is nutso
[1:43:10] <andre11dr> S loops are really fun with Baby
[1:43:11] <+HungryHungryEmu> s broly struggles but does dumb damage
[1:43:16] <ELFucilaNeroIV> NuBroly is a combo vid made into a character.
[1:43:18] <sunnythedrunk> @pearsnickety Old Broly is wayyy stronger character. but new one is fun
[1:43:30] <Applecannon63> @pearsnickety Nu Broly has fun combos compared to Z Broly
[1:43:33] <andre11dr> REGGIE YOUR FAILING US
[1:43:34] <+aBoner89> i like the contrast between woolz and reggie:  calm and focused / having a blast lol
[1:43:50] <andre11dr> YOU HAVE DARK POWERS
[1:43:53] <+Ricky_Rexx> Raging blast
[1:43:54] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Just throw proyectiles with baby
[1:43:55] <GenericSoda> oh that baby color is hideous
[1:43:55] <outtahellos> only realised 18 is Launch voice actor
[1:43:55] <+polothegreatest> Broly z power is MAXIMMUMER TableHere
[1:44:01] <ElementalX1000> Don't have to fear no neutral if you don't let neutral happen
[1:44:07] <Applecannon63> like I don't care Z broly is stronger his combos are boring
[1:44:12] <BlackermanZX> Launch who kolMagma
[1:44:14] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:44:14] <leith_aziz> They really made Hit look cool
[1:44:19] <outtahellos> xD
[1:44:21] <slightscumbag> @outtahellos So at least we get Launch's voice
[1:44:28] <andre11dr> We need to tell Reggie about the flip, shit what is it again?
[1:44:28] <Pt_Kamen> GO APE
[1:44:30] <+Ricky_Rexx> Launch has a voice?
[1:44:32] <leith_aziz> uhhh...
[1:44:32] <Shad0wTag> @leith_aziz one of the saving graces of DBS
[1:44:34] <leith_aziz> F
[1:44:35] <%CaptainPileDriver> so, what would you rather see chat, gogeta insta kill or the body change
[1:44:35] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[1:44:37] <GenericSoda> Um
[1:44:39] <sunnythedrunk> LUL
[1:44:40] <andre11dr> I think it's hadoken back
[1:44:40] <+aBoner89> LUL
[1:44:41] <%Josef_Stryker> LUL
[1:44:44] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[1:44:52] <Shad0wTag> @captainpiledriver Body Change easy
[1:44:55] <+pearsnickety> Damn I have never heard Baby 2's dub voice. It's just Buggy the Clown holy shit.
[1:44:56] <DrkJP520> ENG Baby sounds a LOT like JP Baby. Must be the most faithful to the JP cast in terms of voice.
[1:45:01] <+Ricky_Rexx> Quit flirting Reggie
[1:45:03] <%CaptainPileDriver> body change it is
[1:45:03] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Baby ki blasts return back
[1:45:25] <andre11dr> Chat what's broken flip move with UI ? is it hadoken back?
[1:45:29] <Shad0wTag> @drkjp520 they nailed it back in GT, I'm just glad he came back to his role
[1:45:32] <leith_aziz> I'm gonna go rest now. Thanks for the convo, chat. Night
[1:45:33] <%Drunkengen> 2 dunks
[1:45:36] <slightscumbag> @pearsnickety I love that One Piece dub is just the cast of Dragon Ball honestly
[1:45:37] <andre11dr> It's been a while
[1:45:44] <Shad0wTag> @leith_aziz night dude
[1:46:06] <ELFucilaNeroIV> LUL
[1:46:09] <%CaptainPileDriver> @andre11dr yes, it is i believe
[1:46:12] <Yemmer> everyone who uses JP thinks English is weird and everyone who uses English thinks JP is weird, it's nothing new. it will always be this way.
[1:46:31] <ElementalX1000> Perfectly balanced
[1:46:34] <%CaptainPileDriver> @andre11dr cause i think the ex is the sparkle backflip that just beats everything
[1:46:38] <Applecannon63> no sub vs dub debates jeez
[1:46:39] <sunnythedrunk> happy birthday drop NotLikeThis
[1:46:47] <andre11dr> @captainpiledriver Exactly
[1:46:48] <Shad0wTag> @yemmer They best option in games is setting characters by language rather than a universal option
[1:46:54] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[1:47:02] <@Solidus_113> every time
[1:47:03] <%MajorCrasher> chat how does UI Goku's dodge mechanic work?
[1:47:11] <Pt_Kamen> Suicide!
[1:47:14] <outtahellos> woolieMIRIN woolieMIRIN woolieMIRIN
[1:47:29] <Shad0wTag> I love that SF4 and SF5 just let you set each character to whatever VA language you like. God I wish Strive did that
[1:47:31] <ELFucilaNeroIV> 6H with UI lets you dodge
[1:47:38] <@Solidus_113> all this meter
[1:47:39] <+polothegreatest> the correct is mex dub LUL
[1:47:41] <Applecannon63> @majorcrasher its like the Mishima Step gimmick
[1:47:42] <Pt_Kamen> Self Destruct A16
[1:47:45] <+LandOfTheWay> cmon reggie, return to monke
[1:47:52] <@Menitta> So what are the changes to the assist tag mechanic
[1:47:58] <%MajorCrasher> thanks @elfucilaneroiv
[1:48:03] <%CaptainPileDriver> @MajorCrasher the flips beat most everything while flipping, he has a command dodge button that puts him behind the opponent and he has a counter level 1
[1:48:11] <Ardisan_> Wait youre parents gave you a Spirit Bomb?
[1:48:16] <andre11dr> Reggie EX hadoken back, IT WINS THE GAME
[1:48:22] <@Solidus_113> @Menitta tag out of specials like it's MvCI
[1:48:22] <%CaptainPileDriver> @Menitta basically every special move you can just tag into another character
[1:48:24] <Shad0wTag> @menitta tag after any special moves
[1:48:25] <+polothegreatest> is tekken the one with individual dub?
[1:48:26] <%Sparkseid> Reggie has yet to turn to monke
[1:48:30] <BlackermanZX> believe it kolUuRAaAMESsSHI
[1:48:53] <@Menitta> Oh so you can Switch characters after a special immediately
[1:48:57] <@Menitta> that's dope
[1:49:06] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Yes, it stops time
[1:49:08] <Shad0wTag> @menitta straight outta Marvel Infinite
[1:49:18] <@Menitta> Oh wow yeah that's awesome
[1:49:24] <+pearsnickety> @polothegreatest yeah each character speaks their respective language and all understand each other perfectly IIRC
[1:49:32] <andre11dr> Oh shit i just realized, UI now get to switch after thr flip move
[1:49:37] <ELFucilaNeroIV> LUL
[1:49:45] <@Solidus_113> it doesn't time stop on block though
[1:49:48] <Ardisan_> Full testosterone the game
[1:49:51] <%CaptainPileDriver> @Menitta yep, it also lead to the gotenks glitch that if you tag right after he does his spinning top when his leg lifts up to kick and then immedietly as the next character comes out get his level 3, you break the game
[1:49:51] <+polothegreatest> LUL LUL LUL
[1:50:01] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Baby actually has a lvl3 that's has a guard point LUL
[1:50:31] <Applecannon63> @elfucilaneroiv apparently his Lv3 got nerfed
[1:50:34] <Shad0wTag> chat remind whats the star under Reggie's meter for?
[1:50:42] <@Solidus_113> wins?
[1:50:46] <Shad0wTag> gotcha
[1:50:49] <+HungryHungryEmu> how many wins
[1:50:57] <Applecannon63> yes
[1:51:00] <andre11dr> @shad0wtag Sparking you mean?
[1:51:04] <BlackermanZX> regg gotta chdck the UI moveset
[1:51:18] <%CaptainPileDriver> his pets ear
[1:51:19] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:51:22] <+Ricky_Rexx> Ba's ear
[1:51:22] <+SilverInferno3> The ear of his dead animal friend :(
[1:51:27] <+Parrish_broadnax> it is not
[1:51:28] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's his pets ear his dad shot
[1:51:29] <Afrosamasenpai> IT WAS HIS FRIEND
[1:51:29] <+HungryHungryEmu> his bestfriend T_T
[1:51:30] <%Sparkseid> his dead friend
[1:51:30] <DrkJP520> No, it's the ear from his friend
[1:51:30] <Pt_Kamen> it was his friend!
[1:51:32] <+pearsnickety> Woolie IT'S HIS FRIENDS EAR
[1:51:34] <Applecannon63> Nakama
[1:51:35] <+Parrish_broadnax> yea its his pet
[1:51:38] <%Josef_Stryker> His friend's ear
[1:51:40] <+Ricky_Rexx> No his dad shot it's ear off to teach him suffering or something
[1:51:42] <+SilverInferno3> His dad killed it BibleThump
[1:51:43] <+Reverend_Roscoe> MAMORU
[1:51:46] <%CaptainPileDriver> i don't cause i'm a nerd
[1:51:49] <+Parrish_broadnax> that Movie is SICK
[1:51:54] <RAH001> i think its the skin from the ear of a animal he saw as his pet even tho that pet tried to kill him
[1:51:57] <%CaptainPileDriver> yeah, that movie is fucking awesome
[1:51:59] <@Menitta> wow that's a lot of characters
[1:52:00] <ELFucilaNeroIV> DBS Broly is sick, a sakuga fest
[1:52:01] <BlackermanZX> Oh that movie fucking rules
[1:52:01] <Tracazoid> It's the best part of Super
[1:52:01] <roboyuji> It was his dear friend!
[1:52:01] <+SilverInferno3> Oh wait they're right, it didn't die but it got scared of Broly cuz of his pops
[1:52:02] <DrkJP520> It's like a fucking fireworks show.
[1:52:06] <%MajorCrasher> THAT MOVIE'S INCREDIBLE
[1:52:07] <Vyneci> The beast didn't die, but it lost an ear and it never interacted with Broly again
[1:52:09] <+Parrish_broadnax> the new movie... will not be as fun
[1:52:10] <+Reverend_Roscoe> MONEY FUCKING ON
[1:52:12] <%Irridium> VEGETA DOESN'T GET FUCKING JOBBED
[1:52:13] <@Solidus_113> Cheelai
[1:52:13] <+pearsnickety> Paragus was a huge dick and shot it off to make Baa avoid Broly.
[1:52:15] <+Ricky_Rexx> @SilverInferno3 Baa didn't die actually, just lost an ear so he's still alive
[1:52:15] <%CaptainPileDriver> @Menitta and most of them are goku and vegeta
[1:52:18] <+SilverInferno3> Even the 3DCG fights were dope for once
[1:52:18] <aircitystudios> Super Broly is really sympathetic in that story :(
[1:52:27] <dr_doriah> Vegeta: this is getting annoying!
[1:52:28] <@Menitta> its true
[1:52:30] <roboyuji> I saw it in the theater it was rad
[1:52:36] <%kewlmyc> They made Broly into an actual character
[1:52:40] <%CaptainPileDriver> JANEMBA HAS TELEPORTS
[1:52:42] <%traximus_s> paragis did nothing wrong
[1:52:43] <%CaptainPileDriver> YEYEYE
[1:52:44] <BlackermanZX> also dbs broly is way cooler than baby man z broly
[1:52:44] <@Menitta> Is Bardock still good
[1:52:45] <%Zero_Jacks> zyzxGRASP zyzxCmere
[1:52:45] <emeraldskrull> the movie has a hot green girl and thats the only good part about it tbh
[1:52:50] <Pt_Kamen> Pur Hit's Music!
[1:52:55] <+Reverend_Roscoe> janemba is so cool
[1:52:55] <+polothegreatest> D I V I N I T Y
[1:52:57] <ECRead> man that movie was the best theater experience I ever had
[1:53:04] <outtahellos> Big green!
[1:53:05] <Applecannon63> @irridium only problem for vegeta is no explanation to how he got super sayain god
[1:53:05] <Ardisan_> Surprising for a DBZ character to have a deep story
[1:53:12] <andre11dr> Blue Gogeta is more hype tho
[1:53:19] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Potara gang
[1:53:25] <Pt_Kamen> Put Hit's Song
[1:53:26] <+Ricky_Rexx> I just wish more cool dudes were in this game instead of 5 gokus
[1:53:27] <@Menitta> yeah Kefla
[1:53:31] <@Menitta> kefla is fun
[1:53:35] <DrkJP520> They made Broli a character in the movie, but then he goes ape shit as usual for 40 minutes straight
[1:53:40] <Shad0wTag> Gainax Pose the team @woolieversus
[1:53:45] <%diegobandzz> Cells intro is always hype !
[1:53:51] <%Josef_Stryker> I just appreciate that the devs weren't cowards and gave Kefla defined muscles
[1:53:55] <Applecannon63> I wish Kefla's hair was broly hair more
[1:53:57] <+Ricky_Rexx> Like why isn't Naruto in this game?
[1:53:59] <%CaptainPileDriver> IT DOES
[1:54:01] <ELFucilaNeroIV> It does
[1:54:02] <%CaptainPileDriver> DON'T DO IT
[1:54:04] <+Parrish_broadnax> Sure DOESA
[1:54:06] <+cubbywolf> all anime music is copyright
[1:54:07] <andre11dr> It sure will
[1:54:10] <%Sparkseid> yeah it sucks
[1:54:11] <%townzzzzz> play character themes
[1:54:11] <%Irridium> @Applecannon63 I mean he could always do God Blue so it'd stand to reason he'd have access to the the Base god version
[1:54:14] <%kewlmyc> AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH

[1:55:22] <Ardisan_> What is Janemba from. I dont know this guy
[1:55:23] <%CaptainPileDriver> quarter circle forward special with janamba is his teleport
[1:55:23] <+cubbywolf> kefla mix is so simple its dirty
[1:55:25] <andre11dr> Honestly Ive heard this theme so much that it just doesn't hit the same
[1:55:29] <+Reverend_Roscoe> YO
[1:55:30] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Janemba can do two teleports now
[1:55:38] <Shad0wTag> @ardisan_ DBZ Movie Fusion Reborn
[1:55:38] <andre11dr> It just gives me PTSD at this point
[1:55:38] <%CaptainPileDriver> yes
[1:55:39] <+Reverend_Roscoe> that deflection into the background
[1:55:40] <%CaptainPileDriver> and it's filthy
[1:55:41] <DrkJP520> @Ardisan_ dbz movie 12
[1:55:41] <BlackermanZX> Janemba is from the fusion reborn movie
[1:55:45] <Clyderso> Janemba teleported to the grave

[1:56:16] <outtahellos> they fight hitler in that 1 xD
[1:56:18] <@Menitta> God, the fact that death leads back to neutral is the best part of this game
[1:56:26] <+cubbywolf> dbfz has non cannon movie characters, dbgt characters and super characters on top of Z. it's crazy
[1:56:27] <%CaptainPileDriver> @Menitta yes, yes it is
[1:56:32] <Applecannon63> Janemba is just Buff if he was Pokémon cause he says his name much
[1:56:38] <andre11dr> @ardisan_ Fusion Reborn is a good one
[1:56:40] <Applecannon63> *Buu
[1:56:42] <+Ricky_Rexx> even if Janemba is just a knock off Buu he's still one of the most enjoyable movie villains imo
[1:56:47] <+pearsnickety> well thanks for the convos chat, gotta go toil away at work, might pick up FighterZ again, seems fun

[1:59:44] <%ChoculaUltra> remember in GT when the grand kais used a pair of giant pliers to pull Goku's tail back out so he could go SS4? That was a trip.
[1:59:47] <andre11dr> He was like Magneto in MVC2 but with servebot hitboxes
[1:59:49] <Buddha0991> @0dinpen if i recall he started out slightly weaker than his Z self and eventually surpassed his old strength
[2:00:02] <+cubbywolf> goku is a beat weaker lore wise as gt kis but he can still go ssj3 and 4 so hes stronger than Z goku
[2:00:15] <+0dinpen> godbless dbz lore, ty guys
[2:00:23] <andre11dr> @choculaultra I try to forget GT happened
[2:00:27] <Ardisan_> The name Vegito will always just make me think of Doritos
[2:00:31] <+polothegreatest> remember the bingo dimmension?
[2:00:47] <andre11dr> Despite the fact that i think the Baby arc is pretty fun
[2:00:52] <%ChoculaUltra> @andre11dr I did too. Until they added GT Goku and SS4 Gogeta to FighterZ FeelsBadMan
[2:00:53] <Buddha0991> GT has some good ideas misused and they tend to make great videogame characters so im happy being around still in games
[2:01:00] <outtahellos> whos watchign super Db heroes?
[2:01:02] <+cubbywolf> thats because max needs to watch anime
[2:01:05] <AstrodropGaming> Combo drops for everybody!
[2:01:07] <%CaptainPileDriver> @outtahellos never
[2:01:10] <+cubbywolf> ew db heroes
[2:01:12] <+0dinpen> i refuse to watch db heroes lmao
[2:01:12] <+Parrish_broadnax> I'll go see it
[2:01:12] <andre11dr> But after that shit goes down to hell
[2:01:13] <Shad0wTag> @outtahellos not for my sanity
[2:01:15] <ELFucilaNeroIV> You do j.S into air grab with vegito I believe
[2:01:16] <+Ricky_Rexx> I don't give a shit about gt but I do wish Baby and Super saiyan 4 were canon
[2:01:18] <+Parrish_broadnax> Oh the card game
[2:01:22] <Shad0wTag> it literally just a giant ad
[2:01:23] <outtahellos> woolieMIRIN fair
[2:01:26] <+Parrish_broadnax> I thought we were talking about the new movie lol
[2:01:45] <+Ricky_Rexx> I like the idea of the Shadow Dragons from GT but they just didn't feel cool or interesting enough
[2:01:52] <Buddha0991> Majuub is maximum awesome idea used badly
[2:01:54] <%Axle13j> LMAO
[2:01:54] <+Parrish_broadnax> PUNT THAT MAN
[2:01:57] <Miles_Stardiver> Man, that heal is fucking batshit
[2:01:58] <sunnythedrunk> Only nuovo shenron was cool
[2:02:01] <%Josef_Stryker> KILL THAT SMALL CHILD
[2:02:02] <@Solidus_113> didn't they add 2 sparkings?
[2:02:02] <Shad0wTag> @ricky_rexx its because 3 of them they were all gag characters
[2:02:04] <+cubbywolf> new movie probably gunna have shitty japanese cgi. they are so far behind in animated cg it's sad
[2:02:05] <DrkJP520> RYU KEN
[2:02:05] <@Menitta> This game is so hype
[2:02:09] <%CaptainPileDriver> that level 3 does so much damage
[2:02:10] <Shad0wTag> *bar
[2:02:12] <@Menitta> why'd it drop off
[2:02:15] <+Ricky_Rexx> @Buddha0991 GOD I forgot Majuub even existed! Why can't we bring him back
[2:02:19] <%CaptainPileDriver> hello
[2:02:20] <+Parrish_broadnax> Hello~
[2:02:24] <@Menitta> hello
[2:02:25] <andre11dr> My biggest problem with GT is thst the fights and the villains suck and kid Goku was just a bad idea
[2:02:32] <%Axle13j> That tag in was sweet
[2:02:34] <ELFucilaNeroIV> @solidus_113 that's an arena match only mode, you also get 4 air jumps
[2:02:34] <+SilverInferno3> I do wonder if Toriyama took inspiration from SSJ4 for new Broly. The way his power is drawn from the Oozaru form is the same as how SSJ4 works
[2:02:34] <+Ricky_Rexx> @Shad0wTag exactly outside of Nova, Eis, and Sin I don't remember any of them
[2:02:40] <Ardisan_> Is original Kid Goku in this too?
[2:02:40] <+cubbywolf> it dropped because strive and rollback that's it
[2:02:44] <andre11dr> Also Pen doesn't do anything
[2:02:46] <Vyneci> SDBH is like Pat and Woolie described Hobbs and Shaw, just completely turn your brain off and it's enjoyable/tolerable LUL
[2:02:47] <%CaptainPileDriver> YEEEEAH
[2:02:48] <Pt_Kamen> Super 17 was cool
[2:02:48] <+Ricky_Rexx> @Ardisan_ no just gt kid
[2:02:50] <%CaptainPileDriver> THE RAT DIED
[2:02:53] <%Josef_Stryker> @Ricky_Rexx At least Super finally hinted at Buu being a thing with the Moro Arc
[2:02:53] <Applecannon63> @cubbywolf doesn't seem shitty I've seen some anime movies did some good blend of cg to 2d animations
[2:02:55] <@Menitta> yknow what rollback is a good reason
[2:02:55] <%CaptainPileDriver> GOOD RIDANCE
[2:03:00] <%Josef_Stryker> @Ricky_Rexx Uub
[2:03:00] <andre11dr> THE RAT IS DEAD
[2:03:05] <sunnythedrunk> Woolie backwards hadouken on special is a command dash
[2:03:07] <andre11dr> FUCK YEAH
[2:03:11] <sunnythedrunk> for kflea
[2:03:14] <mothdude> the girlfriends
[2:03:15] <sunnythedrunk> kefla
[2:03:18] <%Axle13j> evoCha - awwww
[2:03:21] <%ChoculaUltra> Controversial opinion - I was completely okay with the DBS manga trying to completely retcon power levels with that Jiren vs Master Roshi bit hinting at UI.
[2:03:24] <+Ricky_Rexx> Wasn't Uub techincally from Z first? Only got more screentime in GT?
[2:03:28] <@Solidus_113> why can't Plague's DBZ girls be the real canon ones FeelsBadMan
[2:03:31] <Shad0wTag> @ricky_rexx literally one of them came from the dumb oolong wish and I was like oh god
[2:03:41] <+Parrish_broadnax> Uub is from Z yes
[2:03:47] <Shad0wTag> @ricky_rexx He was he appears at the literal end of z after buu
[2:03:47] <+Ricky_Rexx> SO WHERE IS HE
[2:03:50] <+Parrish_broadnax> and even shows up in the manga of super
[2:03:53] <+polothegreatest> LUL LUL LUL
[2:03:56] <andre11dr> @solidus_113 The world is not ready for that stuff
[2:03:59] <%kewlmyc> I'm happy Kefla has muscle definition, but it's weird neither Kale nor Caulifa do
[2:04:01] <+Ricky_Rexx> Then bring Uub back Toriyama
[2:04:01] <+Parrish_broadnax> LOOK we JUST GOT UUB in the mobile game
[2:04:02] <Shad0wTag> @choculaultra context?
[2:04:04] <+Parrish_broadnax> that man gets NO love
[2:04:04] <Buddha0991> yea but he fuses with Good Majin Buu permanently halfway through to become Majuub, which is super hype and fitting but they used him SO weirdly
[2:04:13] <+cubbywolf> not all japanese studios are bad at cg but outside mappa and ufotable i dont know a good studio that can cg
[2:04:14] <@Menitta> I still like Califla and Kale
[2:04:18] <Pt_Kamen> Neko Majin Z is stronger
[2:04:25] <Buddha0991> @kewlmyc Kale gets buff in Super Saiyan 2 but Caulifla doesnt for some reason
[2:04:27] <outtahellos> Granolah for fighterZ xP
[2:04:37] <%hojynn> hojynn subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! bruh
[2:04:46] <Shad0wTag> @buddha0991 he gets outshined by SSJ4 thats why
[2:04:57] <+Ricky_Rexx> I love everything about Buu and Uub is such a cool idea about Buu's evil stronger half getting a second chance so Goku gets chance to enjoy fighting him
[2:05:00] <andre11dr> @menitta I like them in concept but they're just so annoying to me
[2:05:04] <Ardisan_> Kelfa has anti drip. Where her drip game at bro
[2:05:12] <%kewlmyc> Won't get a FighterZ 2 until at least that new movie is out. Wonder if the manga characters will show up
[2:05:12] <%ChoculaUltra> @Shad0wTag in the last leg of the Tourney of Power, Master Roshi dodges a full barrage of Jiren's hits while chastising Goku about worrying about power levels. He gets eliminated but Goku starts to "get" Ultra Instinct as more of a horizontal power-up as opposed to a vertical one.
[2:05:14] <+Ricky_Rexx> @Ardisan_ No style
[2:05:16] <%Axle13j> Hello~
[2:05:26] <%CaptainPileDriver> i'm ready with my team dedicated to body stealing
[2:05:26] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:05:27] <+SilverInferno3> @Ricky_Rexx She has no grace
[2:05:31] <+Parrish_broadnax> I wonder if They did the fusion dance instead if they would get a better outfit
[2:05:34] <Buddha0991> also its really funny that baby Pan in super is already way stronger than her GT Pan self
[2:05:43] <dark_dmt_samurai> Uub for DBZF
[2:05:44] <+Ricky_Rexx> @SilverInferno3 This Saiyan, has a funny face
[2:05:46] <%CaptainPileDriver> dead
[2:05:51] <Applecannon63> @cubbywolf only problem with the teaser trailer for DBS super hero is the fact that the cg animation got choppy because of camera
[2:05:57] <Buddha0991> what would her name be Caule lol
[2:05:59] <Pt_Kamen> don't drop those bread sticks
[2:06:05] <Shad0wTag> @parrish_broadnax they would get the same outfit as Gogeta and Gotenks
[2:06:07] <%livlinn> Helllooooo shiaVibin
[2:06:11] <+Parrish_broadnax> Ive drawn it
[2:06:13] <andre11dr> Super much like GT has a lot of good things going for it in concept, but in execution, it kinda fails
[2:06:13] <+SilverInferno3> @Ricky_Rexx KA-LE! Super Kale!
[2:06:13] <passserby> cell's command grab looks so weird, with his stiff arm animations
[2:06:15] <%kewlmyc> I WENT TO COLLEGE
[2:06:15] <+Parrish_broadnax> I just would like to see it
[2:06:18] <+Ricky_Rexx> Fusion dance outfit has some drip to it tho
[2:06:21] <Miles_Stardiver> I see Kefla and immediately want her in Kefka's outfit
[2:06:28] <+Parrish_broadnax> the Fusion vest is pretty nice
[2:06:29] <PMda2nd> @kewlmyc LUL
[2:06:35] <Buddha0991> I love caulifla and kale as characters but kefla needs a cooler outfit
[2:06:35] <dandy_bones> He’s quite confident in his speed, y’know
[2:06:51] <@Solidus_113> get black in there
[2:06:57] <+Ricky_Rexx> I like the idea of the outfits getting merged together too but idk it just looks kinda weird even on vegito
[2:07:02] <+SilverInferno3> Put the pigtails on coward
[2:07:03] <+esoteric_simp> short haired girl...
[2:07:04] <Ardisan_> Vadel is great, I like her.
[2:07:05] <Buddha0991> it would be cool if fusion dance for them focused on kales personality more and she was more serious than kefla
[2:07:07] <sunnythedrunk> Videl's spot dodge now cancels into dp
[2:07:13] <sunnythedrunk> she got a huge buff
[2:07:13] <+cubbywolf> pigtails or riot
[2:07:14] <Shad0wTag> @buddha0991 unless either of theit outfits the joint one will be the same
[2:07:16] <%ChoculaUltra> ArcSys woulda made easy easy money if they released DLC costumes. Red scarf Future Trunks, SS2 Gohan with the Goku fit from the Bojack movie, etc etc.
[2:07:19] <andre11dr> We gotta get Black in here you guys
[2:07:21] <Shad0wTag> COOLER TIME BOYS
[2:07:25] <Buddha0991> it was cool that gogeta and vegito were like that at first but then both gt and super kind of put the kibosh on that
[2:07:26] <Shad0wTag> EEEYAH
[2:07:30] <+cubbywolf> cooler has a gun
[2:07:32] <sunnythedrunk> EEYAH
[2:07:32] <+Ricky_Rexx> That man isn't black

[2:07:39] <%Zero_Jacks> lytDUNKED lytWHAT
[2:07:41] <andre11dr> DAMN ,HE'S POPING OFF LUL
[2:07:41] <dandy_bones> Costumes are a bit tough for Arc Sys games
[2:07:43] <+polothegreatest> you arent dealing with the nomal saiyan....
[2:07:43] <%Josef_Stryker> That Patrick Seitz voice tho woolieGASM
[2:07:44] <+SilverInferno3> Reggie needs to call Todd Howard, he's a hard counter to Jiren
[2:07:46] <aircitystudios> Wolf Fang Fist Lets Go!!!
[2:07:52] <@Solidus_113> awooo
[2:07:54] <+cubbywolf> HOLD YOUR FIRE! That man isn't Black.
[2:07:57] <andre11dr> 17 is pretty cool
[2:07:57] <dandy_bones> Since the clothing has to be all manually animated
[2:08:00] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Jiren has counters
[2:08:01] <+Ricky_Rexx> Todd Howard is the worst matchup for Jiren
[2:08:01] <dr_doriah> surabeshi
[2:08:02] <%Axle13j> ahhhh that Super line
[2:08:03] <%Axle13j> lmao

[2:08:19] <%CaptainPileDriver> those memories are back
[2:08:21] <%ChoculaUltra> Classic/Z 17's fit would've been an instant buy for me.
[2:08:21] <andre11dr> Jiren can combo after his counters now
[2:08:22] <Buddha0991> whens MERCENARY TAO tho
[2:08:23] <%CaptainPileDriver> cause he's got sauce again
[2:08:28] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Goku Black is good now
[2:08:33] <+cubbywolf> grill
[2:08:36] <Haarute> goku black got mad buffed
[2:08:39] <BlackermanZX> THIS MAN ISN'T BLACK

[2:08:41] <sunnythedrunk> LUL
[2:08:47] <+SilverInferno3> She knows, she's your daughter in law dude
[2:08:49] <%mr_sups> Goku Black started as one of the best characters, to one of the worst. Now he's good again.
[2:08:49] <+Ricky_Rexx> Videl, Goku has smacked women before don't worry
[2:08:50] <+cubbywolf> time to beat up your son and his gf
[2:08:56] <%Axle13j> THE LEG
[2:08:59] <bigshedman> @BlackermanZX Goddamnit I fucking forgot about that and it gets me every time still LUL
[2:09:04] <Ardisan_> There doesnt seem to be a real OG Dragon Ball character rep yet.
[2:09:05] <+Ricky_Rexx> WELCOME TO THE FAMILY VIDEL
[2:09:06] <Applecannon63> @cubbywolf like the reason the teaser trailer on why it was choppy cause it was syncing up to camera movement and the fact they didn't demonstrate it in a 2d background makes worrisome
[2:09:12] <Shad0wTag> Get the gun out Reggie!
[2:09:24] <Buddha0991> @Ardisan_ Tien and Roshi have a ton of the techniques they used in OG, but they have their super outfits
[2:09:29] <andre11dr> Goku be like, I'M SON GOKU, A WOMAN BEATER LUL
[2:09:39] <%ChoculaUltra> when they announced Roshi for FighterZ, I was hoping he'd get like a Jackie Chun install style super FeelsBadMan
[2:09:47] <%CaptainPileDriver> yo anyone in chat wanna play some practice rounds
[2:09:51] <+cubbywolf> this is the only game where yamcha is a chad
[2:09:53] <+Ricky_Rexx> Goku doesn't know the meaning of the term "respecting women"
[2:10:02] <@Solidus_113> respecting the battle
[2:10:07] <Shad0wTag> #letcoolerEEYAH
[2:10:07] <+SilverInferno3> Not holding back is how Goku respects women
[2:10:07] <Miles_Stardiver> No Respect Only Fight
[2:10:14] <Buddha0991> also wheres the people's champ mr satan, the savior of the universe twice over
[2:10:17] <%Axle13j> wake up level 3 counter babyyy
[2:10:18] <%CaptainPileDriver> BEAN SOUP

[2:10:21] <BlackermanZX> YAHH
[2:10:21] <Ardisan_> Goku just wants to punch people and get strong
[2:10:25] <+cubbywolf> goku respects everyone equally... as long as they can fight gud
[2:10:25] <Shad0wTag> HE DID IT
[2:10:27] <outtahellos> uknow!
[2:10:27] <+polothegreatest> soup
[2:10:29] <ELFucilaNeroIV> That's a counter lvl3 so it's perfect for reggie
[2:10:31] <Shad0wTag> EYAAAH
[2:10:32] <%ChoculaUltra> Mr. Satan should've been the last dlc character, hands down.
[2:10:35] <+Ricky_Rexx> No playable Mr Satan? Oh yeah that's why I dropped this trash game
[2:10:44] <Qsmash_> Reggie is remembering
[2:10:45] <PMda2nd> let's go Reggie
[2:10:47] <Ardisan_> Oh yeah
[2:10:51] <Ardisan_> Why isnt Satan on here
[2:10:57] <andre11dr> Goku is like if unga got a new laier of smart fusion, but it's just unga smart
[2:10:58] <%MajorCrasher> REGGIE THE GOD

[2:11:49] <andre11dr> Well would you look at that there's nothing but Goku on Reggies team
[2:11:52] <+Ricky_Rexx> I want the next game to only have the most obscure db characters

[2:12:56] <%yendoria> Isn't he supposed to go SS3 during that?
[2:12:57] <Shad0wTag> AYYY
[2:12:59] <%hojynn> two supers now
[2:13:01] <Applecannon63> whut!?
[2:13:02] <mothdude> He has a new SS1 variant of his Level 3
[2:13:06] <+Ricky_Rexx> When playable Cui?
[2:13:07] <BlackermanZX> he has an alt lvl3 now where he goes only ssj1
[2:13:10] <Buddha0991> whats the difference
[2:13:17] <dr_doriah> ss1 is same side
[2:13:18] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Keeps the same side
[2:13:20] <%CaptainPileDriver> @kewlmyc it's a new change they gave him, instead of a cross up where he goes level 3 he can just do it in front of you and stay super saiyan
[2:13:21] <Buddha0991> ah
[2:13:23] <+LandOfTheWay> if he goes ssj3 he side switches
[2:13:24] <andre11dr> I forgot he had the SSJ1 super now
[2:13:24] <%Sparkseid> cool
[2:13:25] <%ChoculaUltra> SS3 is the side switch
[2:13:26] <mothdude> Slightly less damage too

[2:14:50] <WakeUpThrow> Tao would've been SICK
[2:15:01] <Shad0wTag> @menitta Its too closer to Frieza's design I bet to to add
[2:15:03] <Applecannon63> plant a dumbass tree
[2:15:04] <andre11dr> @menitta What why ,Shredder Cooler is so much better
[2:15:05] <+Ricky_Rexx> @dandy_bones Yeah there's a real pick
[2:15:08] <Shad0wTag> @applecannon63 MY MAN
[2:15:09] <%ChoculaUltra> Yajirobe and Korin as one joke character duo like Videl and Great Saiyaman tho
[2:15:25] <+Ricky_Rexx> MR POPO WHEN?
[2:15:27] <@Menitta> yeah, I understand why they did final Cooler but I just like base Cooler's design so much
[2:15:28] <andre11dr> Regular Cooler is just taller Freeza
[2:15:31] <%Axle13j> @ChoculaUltra that would be fuckin lit lmao
[2:15:32] <aircitystudios> Oh yeah one tip for Yamcha. A good way to end his aerials is with QCB M (Gale Claws). Also casues knockdowns. Hope that helps dude!
[2:15:54] <Shad0wTag> @andre11dr it only makes sense to have Coole in his fifth form than anything else
[2:15:54] <Buddha0991> i like meta cooler's look but yea character wise hes just a ton of robots fucked up decayed real cooler controls
[2:15:54] <%ChoculaUltra> Yajirobe doesn't get enough credit - man cut off Vegeta's tail and saved the fucking planet.
[2:16:01] <%Seancicle> SingsMic
[2:16:02] <Idon__> I am still shocked they never added Future Gohan with all the future pushing last year.
[2:16:17] <outtahellos> Yaji saved goku TWICE in db
[2:16:27] <Buddha0991> every game meta cooler is in is usually portrayed as a final cooler transformation
[2:16:27] <thatpurplefunk> jiren looks like he lifts the heaviest weights with his arms and legs but he never does his abs. Like, ever.
[2:16:28] <%ChoculaUltra> oh word - he totally one-shot Tambourine too LUL

[2:16:35] <mothdude> Patrick Seitz is a treasure
[2:16:35] <Shad0wTag> @idon__ I just wonder if they'd actually give him on arm or the usual bs of giving him 2 arms but never uses the other arm
[2:16:41] <+FuqBoiSlim> HES SO STRONG
[2:16:42] <@Menitta> BIG NUMBER
[2:16:42] <Ardisan_> I hate Jiren so much
[2:16:45] <+Ricky_Rexx> Damn look at  the size of that number
[2:16:50] <aircitystudios> I was reading classic Dragon Ball and was reminded that Yajirobe's pretty damn strong XD
[2:16:51] <andre11dr> BIGGEST NUMBER
[2:16:51] <+esoteric_simp> yooooooo

[2:18:46] <sauceboss310> sugoiDansuhyper sugoiDansuhyper
[2:18:51] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's QCB SPECIAL button

[2:18:52] <mothdude> Zamasu has good taste in Guilty Gear characters
[2:18:54] <%Axle13j> Love Gogeta Blue in this game
[2:18:57] <BackwardCap> 214S to fly
[2:18:57] <%mr_sups> Zamasu is the flight character
[2:18:58] <ELFucilaNeroIV> And Air dash on flight
[2:19:01] <%ChoculaUltra> @Applecannon63 he technically has one, but only on Zamasu as a dramatic finish!
[2:19:06] <andre11dr> Zamasu is pretty much Magneto
[2:19:07] <Idon__> Zamasu is a slicing people up in the new patch
[2:19:07] <+polothegreatest> intros skips
[2:19:07] <%CaptainPileDriver> and each attack button does the slash at different strength levels
[2:19:13] <%mr_sups> HO! HO! HO! TYPHOON!

[2:20:17] <+Ricky_Rexx> Oh it was just a space duck
[2:20:24] <%ChoculaUltra> kinda hoping Reggie manages to go lvl 7 with Gohan just to see the fuckery
[2:20:33] <+Ricky_Rexx> Broly spits hot fire
[2:20:34] <Shad0wTag> @augusm body switched Goku
[2:20:37] <andre11dr> I hope Reggie shows us some lvl 7 Grohan
[2:20:39] <%CaptainPileDriver> still one of the best level 3's
[2:20:40] <Haarute> lvl 7 with gohan is so impossible but it's so fun.
[2:20:40] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Gohan gets nutty at lvl7
[2:20:41] <Ardisan_> Goku Black is the Shadow v.2
[2:20:47] <Ardisan_> Vegata wastn enought
[2:20:58] <Applecannon63> @augusm a kai who swapped souls with goku in an alternate timeline where he killed everyone
[2:21:00] <%CaptainPileDriver> holy shit that was a combo

[2:22:10] <BlackermanZX> oh right Adult Gohan can cancel special to special in lvl7
[2:22:29] <%Axle13j> did anyone else hear gohan yell "darkwing duck"
[2:22:34] <andre11dr> Reggie you have a teleport instant overhead with the EX
[2:22:36] <Haarute> gohan can technically do a TOD without using a single normal at lvl 7
[2:22:54] <%augusm> @shad0wtag @applecannon63 Thank you
[2:22:54] <brunoberserk> raw level 3 ? really ?
[2:22:55] <Shad0wTag> @haarute like god intended
[2:23:01] <sunnythedrunk> lvl 3 gets double airdash now
[2:23:03] <Shad0wTag> @augusm no problem dude
[2:23:15] <Ardisan_> Who is Zemasu
[2:23:16] <%Axle13j> nice
[2:23:27] <%CaptainPileDriver> @Ardisan_ a not very interesting villain in super
[2:23:37] <mothdude> Zamasu is Goku Black's original body
[2:23:41] <andre11dr> @ardisan_ He was black
[2:23:47] <Ardisan_> :/
[2:23:47] <%MajorCrasher> nobody in chat watched super LUL
[2:23:49] <%Axle13j> LOL
[2:23:54] <Applecannon63> this is true jus-"deadd"
[2:23:54] <Ardisan_> Im not watching Super
[2:23:54] <aka_Jigawatt> LUL
[2:23:55] <%CaptainPileDriver> @andre11dr don't shoot! that MAN ISN'T BLACK
[2:23:56] <%MajorCrasher> can't blame em
[2:23:56] <PMda2nd> nope
[2:24:13] <andre11dr> Looks at Zamasu "You're black"
[2:24:14] <+Ricky_Rexx> Technically this is fuzed zamasu, which is normal zamasu fused with black who is also himself
[2:24:16] <sunnythedrunk> The best part of super is the beerus movie
[2:24:17] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Zamasu is an evil Kai from another universe that steals Goku's body. That's it
[2:24:19] <sunnythedrunk> and the broly movie
[2:24:20] <Ardisan_> I'll give that Broly movie a chance though since Im hearing positive things
[2:24:37] <aka_Jigawatt> i liked super :(
[2:24:38] <%Axle13j> Broly movie is lit
[2:24:38] <Applecannon63> Zamasu is an interesting villain but boy the story role for him is so stupid
[2:24:40] <%CaptainPileDriver> the broly movie is fantastic, the new one
[2:24:45] <Buddha0991> super is fiiiiine, it doesnt do the drama parts as well as z but it taps into the comedy of the og that z forgot a lot of
[2:24:45] <%CaptainPileDriver> not the original or it's bad sequels
[2:24:47] <Wobuzhidao> Broly movie has some nice budget
[2:24:52] <bigshedman> Wait I thought Fused Zamasu was Zamasu fused with Goku Black who is also Zasamu???\
[2:24:56] <Shad0wTag> @ardisan_ its incredible
[2:25:00] <%CaptainPileDriver> @bigshedman he is
[2:25:06] <mothdude> Surprisingly the best parts of Super is the slice of life stuff.
[2:25:07] <sunnythedrunk> Super is fine just does endings really badly outside ToP
[2:25:07] <andre11dr> Wait so if Goku is asians than is Zamasu a  yellow facer?
[2:25:07] <+Ricky_Rexx> @bigshedman That is correct
[2:25:12] <bigshedman> Ok that makes sense thanks guys
[2:25:22] <+Ricky_Rexx> @andre11dr no he's black
[2:25:28] <%augusm> @captainpiledriver Is it about Broly's number going up and being the biggest number ever?
[2:25:31] <+Ricky_Rexx> least thats what they call him
[2:25:34] <Shad0wTag> @andre11dr goku isn't even human, so he isn't japanese buddy
[2:25:34] <brunoberserk> 16 : I LIKE BIIIIIIRDS
[2:25:35] <BlackermanZX> Zamasu is half black
[2:25:41] <aka_Jigawatt> ^
[2:25:41] <%mr_sups> @andre11dr Can you do Yellow and Blackface at the same time
[2:25:42] <ELFucilaNeroIV> yes
[2:25:43] <%mr_sups> ?
[2:25:44] <Applecannon63> @sunnythedrunk the weakest arcs of super is just the frieza and future trunks arc
[2:25:56] <Shad0wTag> @augusm nope not at all
[2:26:04] <+Ricky_Rexx> I liked the tourney of power idc what yall say
[2:26:08] <+faytthepally> Raw super alway wins lol
[2:26:15] <BlackermanZX> Zamasu has only half of the N-Pass
[2:26:17] <sunnythedrunk> @Applecannon63 Facts those endings were so weird. Overextended both when they had perfectly fine endpoints
[2:26:18] <%CaptainPileDriver> @augusm it's about an amazing fight that's the whole movie and how your dad is a bad person

[2:27:50] <Idon__> it's level 3 but it's super slow

[2:28:49] <andre11dr> I like English Cell
[2:28:52] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Bardock was the menace, then GT and now UI.

[2:29:45] <Qsmash_> its fine
[2:29:46] <Idon__> Like damn, then they BUFFED him
[2:29:46] <aircitystudios> Time for some free form jazz!
[2:29:48] <sunnythedrunk> yeah his lvl 3 got hard nerfed
[2:29:53] <%CaptainPileDriver> @Wool years ago, so he couldn't get oki off of it, then the rat came out and got that and more
[2:30:13] <sunnythedrunk> went from full control oki to a safe jump setup from fullscreen
[2:30:25] <sunnythedrunk> not an easy safe jump setup either
[2:30:44] <Shad0wTag> hey chat remember the fighterz flowchart video Woolie made? classic
[2:30:46] <hamahiroyuki> also the funniest comment on zamasu was someone snaping and saying: "God, he's such a Bleach villan!"
[2:30:49] <Shad0wTag> WE GOING IN
[2:30:50] <%CaptainPileDriver> i still cannot believe they released the rat the way they did, he had the same problems as bardock in terms of his oki and setups and he got stronger if he was an anchor which was stupid
[2:31:04] <Shad0wTag> @hamahiroyuki he is very Aizen like
[2:31:05] <andre11dr> I remember when the rat came out was when i stopped paying attention to DBFZ but then season 3 brought me back
[2:31:22] <sunnythedrunk> Honestly the worst thing about GT Goku is that they nerfed double super into the ground except for his
[2:31:31] <aircitystudios> Oh god Zamasu IS Bleach villain XD
[2:31:31] <%ChoculaUltra> not to mention rat was so small that bigger characters legit couldn't hit him with some standing moves before they fixed it, Broly mains were LIVID.
[2:31:31] <andre11dr> But then i realized again that the online sucks
[2:31:40] <+LandOfTheWay> gotta use that meter reggie
[2:31:57] <%Axle13j> god her level 3 is still so cool
[2:32:14] <andre11dr> There's the Krilin version too
[2:32:19] <Manjove> i love using Hit, no flash aat all, just straight jabs all day
[2:32:24] <%CaptainPileDriver> he got bardocks mixup wakeup off of his level 3's and then with the spirit bomb he had so many options and shit
[2:32:24] <+faytthepally> Raw lvl 3 always wins
[2:32:30] <aircitystudios> Wake up Lv3s ALLLL day XD
[2:32:34] <%ChoculaUltra> god help ArcSys if FigtherZ 2 doesn't have rollback. The internet would never let them live it down
[2:32:37] <Qsmash_> if its blue its true
[2:32:43] <BackwardCap> I wonder if they know you can vanish raw lvl 3 on reaction gildedThink
[2:32:55] <Idon__> all these new mechanics and we're still doing wakeup super
[2:32:57] <hamahiroyuki> @Shad0wTag at least aizen had some build-up to a pay off. zamasu felt more like that fullbringer loser in the late shit
[2:32:59] <Shad0wTag> @choculaultra it'd be bandai namcos call if it didn't happen
[2:33:00] <@Solidus_113> forget Figherz 2, if Dungeon Fighter doesn't have rollback it's over
[2:33:01] <andre11dr> You see wake up lvl3 so much in this game, it might as well be the meta
[2:33:03] <ELFucilaNeroIV> @choculaultra Either them or Namco would get the blame. or both
[2:33:13] <+polothegreatest> nah, people will buy another dbfz
[2:33:16] <Sol_Install> if dbfz doesn't have rollback blame bandai cause they have harada probably whispering in there ear
[2:33:16] <%CaptainPileDriver> @Solidus_113 this is the truth
[2:33:17] <Ardisan_> I hope Dungeon Fighter has rollback. I love DF
[2:33:17] <outtahellos> random bt anyone playing DOKKAN battle ?
[2:33:19] <Shad0wTag> @hamahiroyuki I am unpopular for liking the fullbring arc
[2:33:31] <Sol_Install> guys
[2:33:31] <dandy_bones> Nah when’s JOJO FighterZ
[2:33:39] <Idon__> DnF Duel only has one traile half a year ago, I'm not even sure it really exists lol
[2:33:39] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:33:40] <Sol_Install> DNF gonna have rollback
[2:33:41] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Asking the real questions @dandy_bones
[2:33:41] <andre11dr> I mean hell ,Freeza has a hole super dedicated to wake up lvl3 LUL
[2:33:51] <%ChoculaUltra> reminder Ichigo legit went fuck it, I guess I'mma kill these humans during the Fullbring arc LUL
[2:33:54] <+polothegreatest> rollback would be nice
[2:34:08] <+LandOfTheWay> if i remember right, jjba all star battle got a fan mod that actually made it good
[2:34:11] <%ChoculaUltra> 17 year old Ichigo was ready to catch a murder charge.
[2:34:23] <hamahiroyuki> @Shad0wTag I'm not judging man but good lord bruh most ppl would be so mad at you LUL
[2:34:24] <Shad0wTag> @landoftheway wait WHAT
[2:34:26] <aircitystudios> I was kinda hoping for a My Hero Academia Fighterz myself
[2:34:30] <kikoeru_san> what's up with the jazz
[2:34:52] <+faytthepally> RAW 3 BAY BE
[2:34:54] <%CaptainPileDriver> @kikoeru_san it's hit's theme
[2:34:54] <WakeUpThrow> Either JoJo or OP Fighterz would be a dream come true
[2:34:55] <andre11dr> I just want an All Star Jump game made by Arcsis
[2:34:55] <Deko_> LUL
[2:34:59] <BlackermanZX> LUL
[2:34:59] <Shad0wTag> @choculaultra wasn't he done with school after the timeskip after aizen's defeat? wasn't he like 18.
[2:35:05] <dandy_bones> Nah but we need that Arc Sys animation style with JoJo
[2:35:07] <%misteroutdated> LUL
[2:35:12] <dandy_bones> It would be legendary
[2:35:13] <Sol_Install> he stood up
[2:35:14] <+SilverInferno3> Jump Force could've been amazing as an actual fighter
[2:35:15] <Ardisan_> One Piece needs a good fighting game. Please give me one
[2:35:15] <andre11dr> If not that give me a Jojo game
[2:35:18] <Sol_Install> and got SQUASH down
[2:35:21] <kikoeru_san> that explains a lot, I legit never touched hit
[2:35:22] <+LandOfTheWay> @shad0wtag yeah, can't check now cause mobile but i think it increased speed and damage, balanced some moves, and just generally made rounds shorter
[2:35:24] <+a_meat_man> stood up only to fall into an open grave
[2:35:32] <kikoeru_san> or played against one
[2:35:41] <%ChoculaUltra> @Shad0wTag I think he was in his last year of highschool? Japanese highschool is 3 years iirc so idk if the ages line up the same way with western schools
[2:35:51] <andre11dr> One Piece or Jojo  i would be happy eather way
[2:36:02] <@Menitta> Bardock is so cool
[2:36:05] <Haarute> we live by lvl 3, we die by lvl 3.
[2:36:08] <dandy_bones> I think only Arc Sys could make a JoJo game work anyways, considering how unique all their characters are and play
[2:36:09] <FrostedZaibatsu> All raw huh
[2:36:12] <bigshedman> When's REAL Broly? PogChamp
[2:36:21] <+faytthepally> Oh baby I likes it raaaw
[2:36:24] <BackwardCap> @kikoeru_san Hits planet is a retro future modeled after 1980s aesthetic, so his theme is jazzy
[2:36:25] <%ChoculaUltra> also that new Bleach chapter tho, Kubo really setting up that Hell arc monkaS
[2:36:25] <+esoteric_simp> jojo 2d fighter by these dudes Kreygasm
[2:36:32] <outtahellos> taht ODB
[2:36:32] <Buddha0991> this is real broly tho
[2:36:50] <bigshedman> @Buddha0991 No! His power is NOT maximum!
[2:36:50] <DrkJP520> What you all on about? Jojo needs a dating sim
[2:36:52] <andre11dr> Regular Broly is actually cursed now
[2:36:55] <Buddha0991> (i dont mind og broly lol)
[2:36:59] <%Irridium> @ChoculaUltra I don't wanna be pulled back in, I can't. I'm not strong enough...
[2:37:06] <%Axle13j> (I also like OG broly lul)
[2:37:09] <aircitystudios> And with Stone Ocean getting adapted you'd think it'd be prime time for a new JoJo fighter
[2:37:11] <andre11dr> He gets combos afte air throw WHY
[2:37:14] <+Parrish_broadnax> I prefer this broly alot more
[2:37:16] <%Axle13j> Super Broly is better tho
[2:37:17] <Idon__> Regular Broly somehow manages to be both the best grappler and zoner in the game, it's busted.
[2:37:22] <hamahiroyuki> YO, A Jump ArcSys fighting game and the Gintama characters don't have super bars, just good normals
[2:37:22] <bigshedman> [I genuinly think OG Broly is a great fucking design]
[2:37:25] <%ChoculaUltra> @Irridium I lost when I saw Rukia with the side ponytail. I too am weak FeelsBadMan
[2:37:36] <Shad0wTag> honestly despite CC2 and the nonsense of ASB, I do think they understood how to make every character in that game unique. its a shame they aren't actual fighting game devs cuz they got the presentation right
[2:37:36] <Ardisan_> @aircitystudios Did you say that when Part 1-5 came out?
[2:37:50] <dandy_bones> @aircitystudios Either that or a modern re-release of Heritage for the Future with rollback
[2:38:04] <Manjove> Hit is the best design to come out of Super, Beerus doesnt count he was in a Z movie first
[2:38:14] <%mr_sups> _/_/
[2:38:15] <%ChoculaUltra> THIS IS THE STANCE
[2:38:17] <andre11dr> I like Super Broly design more and his an objectively better caracter
[2:38:22] <+SilverInferno3> How's that Jojo battle royale doin by the way
[2:38:28] <andre11dr> From a story perspective
[2:38:30] <The_Grand_J> hello
[2:38:30] <%Axle13j> Niiice
[2:38:34] <+Parrish_broadnax> I just like Tarzan and thats what DBS broly is
[2:38:35] <dandy_bones> Still Arcade and Japan only
[2:38:55] <%CaptainPileDriver> @Manjove that's completely asinine but okay
[2:39:06] <Manjove> fight me
[2:39:12] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[2:39:14] <%Sparkseid> LUL
[2:39:14] <%Axle13j> oof lol
[2:39:14] <+SilverInferno3> Are arcades even still a thing in Japan? I know they do better than in the West but with pandemic and all @dandy_bones
[2:39:15] <Haarute> ALMOST
[2:39:15] <Sol_Install> bruh
[2:39:16] <%Irridium> LUL
[2:39:19] <Mach5Mike> yovgLUL
[2:39:20] <+polothegreatest> LUL LUL LUL
[2:39:20] <+ghostfaceninja_> awwww
[2:39:21] <WakeUpThrow> THe BALLS on this man
[2:39:23] <AstrodropGaming> LUL LUL
[2:39:24] <Idon__> I'm personally a fan of Fused Zamasu before he becomes a Resident Evil monster.
[2:39:25] <hamahiroyuki> daymum
[2:39:26] <bruskiibru> So close lol
[2:39:45] <andre11dr> I told you chat you never see it
[2:39:45] <%mr_sups> Slick
[2:39:47] <SunsetJack> I assume Wolly knows about Hit's shotgun right?
[2:39:48] <PMda2nd> HSWP
[2:39:58] <%CaptainPileDriver> literally beerus is the start of super
[2:39:59] <aircitystudios> The last thing I heard about arcades in Japan was how bad SEGA was hit :P
[2:40:05] <+LandOfTheWay> the fear
[2:40:12] <+SilverInferno3> @aircitystudios Ah yeah, rip club sega :(
[2:40:16] <andre11dr> They buffed Beerus right?
[2:40:18] <%Irridium> if they go online I wanna see someone hit them with the shotgun
[2:40:21] <dandy_bones> @silverinferno3 There are, but they’re kinda struggling. The game is still getting content updates so it’s gotta be making some money
[2:40:25] <Manjove> Battle of Gods was a Z movie, which means Beerus is a Z character
[2:40:27] <%CaptainPileDriver> @andre11dr yeah, i'd say so
[2:40:35] <%CaptainPileDriver> @Manjove he's not
[2:40:42] <%Axle13j> STOMP THE YARD
[2:40:42] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:40:55] <+SilverInferno3> @dandy_bones I see, wonder if it's actually any fun tho
[2:40:57] <+polothegreatest> woolie knows hit's one punch super?
[2:41:08] <andre11dr> I really wanted to play Beerus because his one of my favorite caracters but he was such a struggle
[2:41:25] <Ardisan_> Isnt Beerus a god or something
[2:41:25] <Manjove> yes, Beerus plays really weird
[2:41:44] <%ChoculaUltra> I realize the reason why Goku didn't even consider Cell for the Tourney of Power team is because of how much of a sore loser he is. Dude legit went "fuck this game" when he lost to Gohan LUL
[2:41:50] <WakeUpThrow> He's a god of destruction, ye
[2:41:56] <%CaptainPileDriver> @andre11dr the only person i've ever seen play a beerus that was scary was that spanish player gropis
[2:42:18] <sunnythedrunk> I mean Frieza is just as sore a loser
[2:42:37] <+SilverInferno3> I do think with his Golden Form, Frieza is stronger than Cell anyhow
[2:42:38] <andre11dr> @ardisan_ Oh if you haven't seen Battle of Gods you should  it's a great movie
[2:42:45] <dandy_bones> @silverinferno3 It’s pretty mediocre from what I’ve heard
[2:42:58] <andre11dr> It's easily the best DBZ movie

[2:42:59] <aircitystudios> Yeeaah and now Frieza's on the loose...again...terrorizing the galaxy...good job Goku -_-
[2:43:06] <ECRead> 5M's good. just be aware of spacing.
[2:43:07] <+SilverInferno3> @dandy_bones Shame but I'm not surprised lol
[2:43:08] <%Wool> when in doubt, superdash
[2:43:09] <@Menitta> Broly's catchphrase is "BRAAAAAAAAAAAH"
[2:43:10] <hamahiroyuki> Ok, gintama characters on an ArcSys Jump FG would just be Deadpool in MvC3 right?
[2:43:13] <$Giothegame> Kyden plays Hit I believe
[2:43:18] <$Giothegame> French player
[2:43:20] <sunnythedrunk> Frieza is only in super cuz of popularity I feel
[2:43:22] <Manjove> Kid Buu has stayed in S Tier consistently despite nerfs
[2:43:26] <WakeUpThrow> I love how it looks like 16 is sizing Broly up
[2:43:31] <andre11dr> No Freeza this stream, I'm sad :(
[2:43:33] <Shad0wTag> Cooler's back? YESSS
[2:43:33] <%ChoculaUltra> yeah, Frieza is super popular
[2:43:35] <+LandOfTheWay> @andre11dr considering how much stronger everyone is by ToP compared to the cell saga, yeah, cell is nothing now
[2:43:40] <DrkJP520> DBS is rife with nostalgia pandering
[2:43:41] <bruskiibru> But who doesn't love good ole Frieza shenanigans?
[2:43:42] <Shad0wTag> EEEYAH
[2:43:47] <mothdude> YEAH~
[2:43:49] <@Solidus_113> Kappa
[2:43:53] <%Irridium> That golden frieza buff man... you love it see it
[2:43:54] <sunnythedrunk> Kid buu actually has barely been nerfed and just got buffed this recent patch
[2:44:03] <aircitystudios> Cooler has such a sick design!
[2:44:03] <ECRead> S Broly beam is actually kinda useful in neutral now
[2:44:18] <%Wool> Cooler seems Cool, huh
[2:44:24] <sunnythedrunk> 18 cooler is such a good shell
[2:44:33] <Manjove> i would consider myself a Kid Buu main
[2:44:34] <%kewlmyc> Android 16 working for Red Cross and Shield.
[2:44:39] <Shad0wTag> HERES MY BOY
[2:44:40] <%ChoculaUltra> Cooler should've been canon FeelsBadMan
[2:44:56] <%kewlmyc> Maybe the next movie will make Cooler canon
[2:44:57] <sunnythedrunk> I wish Golden Cooler was more than just a heroes thing
[2:44:57] <Shad0wTag> @choculaultra I will forever pretend he is
[2:45:00] <Manjove> i usually run Kid Buu, Hit and anyone else
[2:45:04] <RocketBarrel> YEEEE-
[2:45:05] <sunnythedrunk> Golden Cooler > Golden Frieza
[2:45:15] <DrkJP520> I feel the only thing Coola has going for him is his design.
[2:45:22] <andre11dr> Let's be honest is Cooler really THAT good? His kinda an inferior Freeza
[2:45:22] <ECRead> you can SD after the 214S
[2:45:23] <aircitystudios> I was hoping for at least a Cooler cameo in Super Broly lol
[2:45:26] <mothdude> Listen, it's a pretty great design
[2:45:29] <$Giothegame> Did Reggie do level 3 in the air by accident? lol
[2:45:30] <Shad0wTag> @drkjp520 his dub VA is also dope
[2:45:34] <Haarute> cooler's lvl 3 is a ground counter but air grab i think
[2:45:43] <@Menitta> oh no
[2:45:51] <sunnythedrunk> I mean Cooler is just a standard db villain
[2:46:02] <Shad0wTag> @sunnythedrunk better than being a Jiren
[2:46:05] <%Irridium> LUL
[2:46:08] <sunnythedrunk> Frieza himself isn't that interesting other than being space hitler
[2:46:09] <%Axle13j> GO BROLY GO GO
[2:46:10] <Manjove> yes, but Cooler is cooler
[2:46:18] <%Axle13j> :(
[2:46:20] <sunnythedrunk> @Shad0wTag Trueeee or Zamasu tbh
[2:46:24] <Shad0wTag> @sunnythedrunk space real estate hitler
[2:46:44] <+LandOfTheWay> am i the only one who thinks golden frieza is stupid as hell? like, all he had to do was train for like a year and he gets to jump from weaker than dr. gero to literally god-level power
[2:46:46] <sunnythedrunk> @Shad0wTag Space Hitler with a touch of Ramsey snow
[2:46:59] <sunnythedrunk> @LandOfTheWay yeah it was pretty dumb
[2:47:10] <GenericSoda> NotLikeThis
[2:47:18] <Shad0wTag> finally the gun came out
[2:47:20] <sunnythedrunk> like all they had to do was write it so that Frieza got wished back 100x stronger or something
[2:47:20] <WakeUpThrow> SHOT
[2:47:22] <BlackermanZX> GUN kolFARMERS
[2:47:22] <%Sparkseid> the RIFLE
[2:47:23] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Yeah that's the biggest problem with Z, the massive power scaling that has to keep happening
[2:47:23] <Qsmash_> not anymore stupid than anything else in db
[2:47:26] <aircitystudios> Resurrection F overall was kinda...rough lol
[2:47:27] <GenericSoda> sajamShoot
[2:47:38] <%AmericanSkidd> AmericanSkidd subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Hey Woolie, You are a cool guy, I like your stuff
[2:47:39] <andre11dr> While Freeza from a writing stand point isn't super deep or anything, his still super charismatic and really entertaining
[2:47:46] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Manjove
[2:47:47] <sunnythedrunk> All the other Z fighters got hoed in Super FeelsBadMan
[2:47:47] <Shad0wTag> @aircitystudios vegeta got ROBBED in that film
[2:47:47] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:47:56] <%Sparkseid> sajamSolphisticated
[2:47:56] <aircitystudios> I KNOW MAN!
[2:47:56] <+LandOfTheWay> oh, i enjoy frieza as a character; he's a fun villain
[2:48:02] <dandy_bones> Frieza is the best DB villain
[2:48:03] <Manjove> i will defeat you with friendship, and this gun i found
[2:48:06] <+polothegreatest> frieza was fat but hit the gym while in hell
[2:48:07] <%Axle13j> At least its in line with dragonball logic. Training is op lol..
[2:48:08] <aircitystudios> Vegeta deserved that kill so much!
[2:48:08] <%Irridium> @sunnythedrunk hey Roshi went toe-to-toe with Jiren in the manga LUL
[2:48:19] <sunnythedrunk> Not letting Vegeta kill Frieza was fucked up
[2:48:25] <BlackermanZX> Hit vs farmer with a shotgun when kolFARMERS
[2:48:26] <@Menitta> Disappointing
[2:48:33] <roboyuji> I dunno, I like that he got a boost because he actually TRIED instead of coasting on natural ability
[2:48:33] <sunnythedrunk> @Irridium LUL and he's not even a Z fighter technically
[2:48:37] <hamahiroyuki> On the theorical ArcSys Jump game: Which Jojo characters should go on launch (that aren't part 3 cuz ffs guys cmon)
[2:48:39] <Qsmash_> Super made them relevant again in ToP, in Z they were irrelevant pass the Saiyan arc
[2:48:43] <+LandOfTheWay> i just wish they had better justification for him being a threat. just make his golden form some god power he stole or wished for or something
[2:48:55] <cahv123> Cooler has an invincible DP.
[2:49:00] <dandy_bones> @hamahiroyuki SPEEDWAGON.
[2:49:13] <mothdude> Frieza never having trained in his life before is pretty hilarious though
[2:49:15] <sunnythedrunk> Tien and Krillin had cool moments vs cell kinda better than ToP imo
[2:49:22] <andre11dr> Maybe my love of Freeza is a beat not exactly fair because when i think of Freeza i think it DBA Freeza, which is an objectively superior version LUL
[2:49:57] <sunnythedrunk> They deadass used Krillin to make a stinky joke and Tien sacrificed himself to take out jobbers
[2:50:14] <%Sparkseid> CUT
[2:50:18] <WakeUpThrow> @hamahiroyuki Just put my boy Okuyasu in there and I'll be happy
[2:50:22] <dandy_bones> The humans in DBZ deserved better
[2:50:31] <hamahiroyuki> @dandy_bones well of course speedwagon. that's also an obvious aweser my mann
[2:50:50] <sunnythedrunk> Especially tien tbh
[2:50:51] <+LandOfTheWay> it makes sense that frieza never trained cause he's just that arrogant, but the idea that he could have that big of a jump in power in just a year is dumb even by db standards
[2:50:52] <aircitystudios> @andre11dr Nothing wrong with that haha. Abridged despite being a parody does improve on some of the story aspects of DBZ XD
[2:51:01] <+polothegreatest> Santana
[2:51:03] <andre11dr> If you think humans have it rough in DBZ just watch Yu Yu Hakusho
[2:51:09] <BlackermanZX> krillin is the only one that gets some respect in super
[2:51:14] <BlackermanZX> tien on the other hand is garbage
[2:51:28] <sunnythedrunk> Tien trained his whole life as is still weaker than people who took years off FeelsBadMan
[2:51:31] <dandy_bones> I think Ringo Roadagain would be cool to be playable
[2:51:33] <WakeUpThrow> Tien trained his whole life to be the weakest in the group NotLikeThis
[2:51:46] <hamahiroyuki> @WakeUpThrow yoo, he'd be godlike to kill off zoners
[2:51:50] <wanderingdain90> Technically !7 and 18 are human
[2:51:51] <%Irridium> Krillin gets a hot android waifu
[2:52:01] <sunnythedrunk> Goku not even asking yamcha to be on the team was so mean FeelsBadMan
[2:52:07] <+SilverInferno3> Roshi got some respect in Super, didn't he?
[2:52:15] <dandy_bones> YAMCHA DESERVED BETTER.
[2:52:16] <$Giothegame> @LandOfTheWay That kind of happens all the time with the time chamber
[2:52:29] <aircitystudios> Time to crank it into hero mode, Reggie! XD
[2:52:31] <dandy_bones> Yamcha was so cool in DB, what happened
[2:52:39] <sunnythedrunk> Like it was fine he wasn't on the team, but Goku is an asshole to his friends like that
[2:52:45] <sunnythedrunk> isn't
[2:52:51] <%Sparkseid> LMAO
[2:53:01] <andre11dr> Cuwobara deserved better to but who's counting
[2:53:09] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Yeah he got a couple of great episodes in the Tournament of Power @silverinferno3
[2:53:10] <BlackermanZX> kolUuRAaAMESsSHI
[2:53:13] <%Sparkseid> doodOne
[2:53:22] <kojanga> So...viewer battles? @WoolieVersus
[2:53:32] <%CaptainPileDriver> man
[2:53:35] <%CaptainPileDriver> i love janemba
[2:53:35] <aircitystudios> Krillin gets treated as the comic relief, but Yamcha is just a straight tragedy now lol
[2:53:44] <hamahiroyuki> YOOO Kira's all bars burned super he resets the round uif close to losing
[2:53:51] <dandy_bones> At least he’s the world’s greatest baseball player
[2:53:52] <%CaptainPileDriver> and i love that they made his command grab longer for his medium and heavy and the light one fast as fuck
[2:53:53] <andre11dr> Janemba is my favorite Pokemon
[2:53:55] <+LandOfTheWay> @giothegame power boosts yes, but no character in db has ever gotten it as crazy as frieza
[2:54:02] <sunnythedrunk> I have no idea how Roshi ended up surpassing yamcha
[2:54:08] <sunnythedrunk> not training for decades
[2:54:24] <%thesickestzak> nliVince nliVince nliVince nliVince
[2:54:28] <%CaptainPileDriver> yamcha stopped fighting cause he went into baseball
[2:54:32] <%CaptainPileDriver> it made money
[2:54:41] <hamahiroyuki> Diavolo's specials take time from the clock
[2:54:54] <GenericSoda> the Broly color reminds me of Hugo from SF3
[2:54:54] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1424943441079832577?s=19
[2:54:54] <sunnythedrunk> I mean Yamcha was still stronger than like Frieza's henchmen
[2:54:56] <andre11dr> Yamcha stopped fighting cause he got money and pussy
[2:55:05] <aircitystudios> Yeah Yamcha's got those Baseball checks at least lol
[2:55:05] <%CaptainPileDriver> yeah but that's not saying much
[2:55:08] <Manjove> not Bulma
[2:55:10] <sunnythedrunk> Roshi hadn't trained to galactic power levels
[2:55:13] <%CaptainPileDriver> most of frieza's henchmen are pretty weak
[2:55:15] <%Axle13j> Don't think there were any other characters in db who started with the power frieza has and then trained tho. Still a mean stretch tho lol
[2:55:22] <dandy_bones> Bites the Dust has a lot of potential to be a cool mechanic
[2:55:30] <dandy_bones> But also very easy to fuck up
[2:55:39] <+projectmanatees> get him reggie
[2:55:41] <%Axle13j> Diavolo taking time off the clock would be sick
[2:55:49] <GenericSoda> garpled
[2:55:49] <%CaptainPileDriver> FREE
[2:55:54] <%CaptainPileDriver> GET DUNKED
[2:55:57] <BlackermanZX> gottem
[2:55:59] <%Sparkseid> grapped
[2:56:01] <sunnythedrunk> My pipe dream is a Frieza family movie where Frieza, Cooler, and King Cold begrudgingly team up to kill Goku
[2:56:02] <voodoolawyer> DUNKSTRUCTIVE FINISH
[2:56:07] <andre11dr> Oh Oh God how does King Crimson work in an FG?
[2:56:14] <sunnythedrunk> and they bicker the whole time
[2:56:16] <ELFucilaNeroIV> I think Moody Blues could be a cool mechanic. Like a record button that repeats your actions.
[2:56:17] <andre11dr> Would it just be a teleport
[2:56:20] <PMda2nd> vinsanity
[2:56:23] <%Axle13j> GG's
[2:56:25] <@Menitta> PLEASE
[2:56:27] <andre11dr> That's kinda lame
[2:56:28] <OblivionSword1> please Rollback
[2:56:28] <%CaptainPileDriver> loooooOOOOL
[2:56:28] <sunnythedrunk> PLEAAAAASe
[2:56:29] <GenericSoda> @ELFucilaNeroIV that's like how Bedman works in Xrd
[2:56:31] <%Irridium> P L E A S E
[2:56:31] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's not gonna happen
[2:56:32] <PMda2nd> arcusGG
[2:56:34] <%thesickestzak> PLEASE!!!!
[2:56:36] <andre11dr> They can't
[2:56:38] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's a fun as fuck game
[2:56:45] <andre11dr> IT WOULD BE REAL EXPENSIVE
[2:56:46] <%thesickestzak> It’s so fun to watch as well
[2:56:51] <puluxor> Not gonna happen, no money to be made
[2:57:06] <hamahiroyuki> Light Yagami is Phoenix Wright in MvC3
[2:57:18] <ELFucilaNeroIV> They can't do it with this. But a sequel...
[2:57:25] <ELFucilaNeroIV> V shift
[2:57:26] <OblivionSword1> v shift
[2:57:27] <voodoolawyer> if we all put our hands up and give our spirit into woolies hands he can drop a rollback spirit bomb onto any fighting game
[2:57:28] <%livlinn> !uptime
[2:57:28] <@Moobot> @livlinn WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 12 minutes
[2:57:28] <$Giothegame> @LandOfTheWay I don't know, Frieza gets his shit rocked even with his boost
[2:57:28] <BlackermanZX> also fucking bandai namco
[2:57:30] <voodoolawyer> maybe just maybe
[2:57:30] <passserby> all that dbfz money is going straight into whatever anime arena fighter they're making
[2:57:32] <%OtakuSnake1> I'd pay $60 for rollback edition
[2:57:40] <%CaptainPileDriver> i would pay for rollback
[2:57:40] <WakeUpThrow> Strive and +R just made it impossible to go back to delay
[2:57:43] <+polothegreatest> no graphics for console in tekken BibleThump
[2:57:44] <@Solidus_113> shouldn't have to
[2:57:48] <%CaptainPileDriver> straight up, just the same game but with rollback
[2:57:51] <aircitystudios> If Fighterz was gonna get rollback, I hope they save it for a potential Fighterz 2.
[2:57:52] <%CaptainPileDriver> i'll throw money at it
[2:57:53] <%thesickestzak> @otakusnake1 same here
[2:58:05] <%Irridium> ArcSys has said they're willing to do the work it all rests in Bamco's hands
[2:58:16] <andre11dr> Like Netherrealms spent A HOLE SHIT TONE of money the put rollback in MKX
[2:58:24] <%thesickestzak> thesickestzak is gifting 5 Tier 1 Subs to WoolieVersus's community! They've gifted a total of 6 in the channel! 
[2:58:24] <%thesickestzak> thesickestzak gifted a Tier 1 sub to Helix_Snake! 
[2:58:24] <%thesickestzak> thesickestzak gifted a Tier 1 sub to asakura_ayase! 
[2:58:24] <%thesickestzak> thesickestzak gifted a Tier 1 sub to TehMud! 
[2:58:24] <%thesickestzak> thesickestzak gifted a Tier 1 sub to abelincoln_catpuncher! 
[2:58:24] <%thesickestzak> thesickestzak gifted a Tier 1 sub to GoodnightSnek! 
[2:58:29] <%CaptainPileDriver> sit down and fucking relearn your buttons and combos then see what changed
[2:58:38] <andre11dr> And that MK ,that shit sells GTA numbers
[2:58:48] <Demoli_PT> is this it for the night or we got strive?
[2:58:52] <DrkJP520> This game was something I fantasized about before it came out. And then it comes out with garbage netcode. tragedy
[2:58:56] <dandy_bones> When’s Guilty Gear Isuka getting rollback though???
[2:59:09] <$Giothegame> I'm not good at learning on my own so I watch tournament footage or guides
[2:59:11] <andre11dr> They would probably lose a lot of money to put rollback at this point
[2:59:24] <BlackermanZX> @dandy_bones asking the real questions here kolUuRAaAMESsSHI
[2:59:27] <%CaptainPileDriver> when it came out, i was tolerant of it's shit online cause i'd go to in person events
[2:59:44] <hamahiroyuki> YOO Light Yagami also has a mechanic of getting the instakill without discovering the opponent's name but you lose half of your life
[3:00:04] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> God I wish DBFZ had good netcode
[3:00:04] <$Giothegame> Maybe this major update to DBFZ is some testing grounds for a sequel
[3:00:08] <andre11dr> I don't think Light would work as a fighter
[3:00:15] <%CaptainPileDriver> what
[3:00:16] <dds333a> amazing
[3:00:17] <%Sparkseid> cool
[3:00:28] <%CaptainPileDriver> does he get hulu on that wifi?
[3:00:34] <andre11dr> Chad move right there
[3:00:48] <%CaptainPileDriver> i can't WAIT for the changes
[3:01:03] <andre11dr> Ch ch ch ch changes
[3:01:04] <%thesickestzak> I know that name!
[3:01:06] <WakeUpThrow> In that potential jump all starts fighter, good luck playing Light against any Bleach character lmao
[3:01:17] <%ojoesama> ojoesama subscribed at Tier 1. 
[3:01:20] <$Giothegame> Oh shit umm be careful about Strive DLC leaks on twitter
[3:01:43] <dds333a> for me, it's still fun.
[3:01:46] <%Wool> DotoDoya was playing critically acclaimed MMORPG Final Fantasy XIV
[3:01:47] <%CaptainPileDriver> i mean, the dlc leak is pretty obvious cause whatever but yeah
[3:01:56] <%CaptainPileDriver> DON'T SHOOT

[3:01:59] <DrkJP520> He's not black

[3:02:05] <dandy_bones> Get (Back) Into Fighting Games
[3:02:05] <andre11dr> Could a Jojo caracter just be able to kick the shit out of light?
[3:02:18] <dds333a> @andre11dr easily

[3:02:49] <Shad0wTag> oh shit we got more games
[3:02:50] <+polothegreatest> ooohh
[3:02:55] <andre11dr> It's something with an Y

[3:02:59] <NotHereToStream> what we playing next?
[3:03:04] <DrkJP520> Only watch Super if you're a Dragon Ball fan. You'll get NOTHING out of it otherwise
[3:03:05] <%CaptainPileDriver> PC strive
[3:03:08] <NotHereToStream> nice
[3:03:11] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Woolie SHODAN cracks me up every time
[3:03:16] <%thesickestzak> Time for the ultimate fighting game.
[3:03:19] <%thesickestzak> Rumble roses
[3:03:19] <%CaptainPileDriver> yo anyone in chat wanna play some dbfz matches
[3:03:30] <%livlinn> PugPls
[3:03:39] <hamahiroyuki> also, what if a stand could interact with ryuk?
[3:03:49] <KINGRAY898> what song?
[3:03:50] <andre11dr> @captainpiledriver Where do you live?
[3:04:05] <%livlinn> kyoryuBoogie kyoryuBoogie kyoryuBoogie
[3:04:05] <NotHereToStream> the song name is on the bottom left of the stream
[3:04:09] <%CaptainPileDriver> minnesota, so i'm on us EAST COAST 1 lobby 24
[3:04:11] <andre11dr> If it's NA that's not happening for me
[3:04:23] <andre11dr> Yep nope LUL
[3:04:23] <KINGRAY898> yeah i just peeped that LUL LUL
[3:04:30] <%CaptainPileDriver> loooool
[3:04:31] <%CaptainPileDriver> fair enough
[3:04:43] <wanderingdain90> mmm this version of Devil Trigger
[3:04:44] <dds333a> @hamahiroyuki it would be interesting, especially since supernatural phemonea exist in both universes, and in fact, Stands have been known to interact with the paranormal. they may not he able to see each other, but maybe
[3:05:09] <%livlinn> was there Woolie's Playlist tho?
[3:05:17] <andre11dr> This netcode just can't do Eastern Europe to NA not without 5 frames of lag
[3:05:40] <andre11dr> And that's if you have good online
[3:05:50] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> It hurts how good KI's netcode still is and then the state of almost everything else lmao
[3:05:55] <andre11dr> If you don't it's like 11 frames
[3:05:58] <DrkJP520> What's coming up?
[3:06:06] <dds333a> Strive
[3:06:14] <DrkJP520> thx
[3:06:19] <dds333a> np
[3:06:41] <bigshedman> @NewAndTastySixthHouse KI and SF3OE on the fucking 360/PS3 having better netcode than modern fighting games hurts my fucking soul man
[3:06:47] <hamahiroyuki> @dds333a yeah, like also ghosts in dragon ball, everyone in bleach, what devil's fruit count as. it would be crazy
[3:07:00] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> SamSho VSP too, the netcode in the Code Mystics release is fuckin immaculate
[3:07:42] <Shad0wTag> Man I wish Iron Galaxy would make another fighting gamw
[3:07:42] <+polothegreatest> american devs made that necode, right?
[3:07:49] <Shad0wTag> @polothegreatest Iron Galaxy
[3:07:54] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Pretty sure Code Mystics are yeah
[3:07:55] <DrkJP520> woolie didn't play system shock, right? just some random fanart?
[3:07:55] <andre11dr> So what where we doing, Arcsis jump game roaster ?
[3:07:56] <WakeUpThrow> Man the difference between SamSho 5 and the new SamSho's netcode makes me sad
[3:08:05] <%thesickestzak> Hope Woolie does a midnight release stream of Nickelodeon All Stars
[3:08:15] <hamahiroyuki> ok, Jump ArcSys FG but the roster is ALL WEIRDOS from major franchises. I pick Ghiacco
[3:08:16] <dds333a> @drkjp520 yeah, seems like LUL
[3:08:24] <andre11dr> If that happens i want Gin the dog playable
[3:08:36] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> @WakeUpThrow It's such a shame, because SS7 released like one second before the demand for better netcode situation really picked up a lot more traction.
[3:08:49] <andre11dr> And the bear
[3:08:50] <SomersaultJustice> ps4 or pc?
[3:08:53] <dandy_bones> Are we ever gonna get a Shrek Superslam stream?
[3:09:14] <%Irridium> PC
[3:09:15] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:09:22] <dds333a> @hamahiroyuki I fucking wish. you already know the Jojo poster boys will get in, Jotaro and DIO (not Dio Brando), and you're lucky to get anyone else LUL
[3:09:40] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Here's hoping one day we'll get an Under Night with actual competent netcode too, UNICLR coming out with the same busted ass online as before made me so sad.
[3:09:52] <hamahiroyuki> if just secondary characters I call dibs on Tsukuyo.
[3:09:58] <%CaptainPileDriver> do it
[3:10:04] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> That boot up patch is real shit
[3:10:05] <Shad0wTag> PC Strive!
[3:10:07] <+cubbywolf> hacks

[3:10:20] <andre11dr> @har
[3:10:23] <%CaptainPileDriver> there's more thicc mods
[3:10:29] <+cubbywolf> I saw a mod with Pot model replaced with a dolphin
[3:10:29] <dds333a> godsend CarlSmile
[3:10:41] <andre11dr> @hamahiroyuki If where going there i pick Sandman
[3:10:42] <NotHereToStream> Goldlewis is suffering against some characters
[3:10:43] <%CaptainPileDriver> thicc milia mods are totally on woolie's computer
[3:10:45] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Goldlewis is sick and has some fun bullshit in certain situations.
[3:10:45] <%Irridium> lord let me fight Reggie's Goldlewis with Axl
[3:10:45] <%townzzzzz> sound?
[3:10:46] <+polothegreatest> theyll "fix it" like sfv rollback LUL
[3:10:46] <hamahiroyuki> @dds333a Yeah I know. I just wanted to get the weird picks to spice up
[3:10:49] <Shad0wTag> @solidus_113 imagine if he even got even a small amount of Octo's mods in game
[3:10:53] <GenericSoda> @cubbywolf somebody I know plays with that and a mod that replaces his voice lines with Macho Man lines
[3:10:55] <%mr_sups> GoldLewis Theme Kicks ass
[3:11:01] <@Solidus_113> no sound
[3:11:06] <+cubbywolf> thats crazy energy

[3:11:08] <%CaptainPileDriver> also yeah @WoolieVersus either sound is low or off
[3:11:14] <voodoolawyer> where's the thick thighs Milia and Totsugeki Pot skins
[3:11:15] <+polothegreatest> muted
[3:11:16] <+cubbywolf> SKY SHOULD BE HIGH
[3:11:16] <%CaptainPileDriver> there you go
[3:11:17] <GenericSoda> SourPls
[3:11:19] <gyrobasel> please keep the music on random
[3:11:21] <dds333a> @hamahiroyuki you and me both. Bruford, F F, N'doul, the like.
[3:11:22] <%CaptainPileDriver> there's the guitar chuggs
[3:11:28] <gyrobasel> the songs get repetitive
[3:11:29] <%CaptainPileDriver> BIG DADDY
[3:11:29] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> That corner combo on twitter with Goldlewis just coffin juggling the person blocking all the way to death LUL
[3:11:31] <GenericSoda> the Lupin outfit

[3:12:14] <voodoolawyer> @WoolieVersus how you feel about faust
[3:12:15] <Shad0wTag> its not a big deal
[3:12:17] <%mr_sups> That ANGRY synth Lead

[3:12:20] <andre11dr> His normals aren't great
[3:12:21] <bigshedman> We can handle it!
[3:12:25] <+OmegaZeroX2> @newandtastysixthhouse Indeed doodOK
[3:12:29] <NotHereToStream> Goldlewis is devestating upclose, but if you keep him out, hes fucked
[3:12:29] <+TheFreeRoamer> I DON'T HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT
[3:12:33] <GenericSoda> Goldlewis fS is good, but it can be low-profiled
[3:12:40] <$Giothegame> Nice more Strive
[3:12:46] <%Irridium> any character with any mid-range options can just poke him to death. if you wanna get in as Goldie you need to do hard reads
[3:12:49] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Goldlewis vs Nago has some super fucked up situations for Nago LUL
[3:12:50] <+cubbywolf> woolie how he imagines himself vs woolie IRL if he was white... FIGHT
[3:12:52] <GenericSoda> catJAM

[3:13:32] <+OmegaZeroX2> @giothegame Jesus doodWat doodWat doodWat but congrats dood doodGood
[3:13:40] <dandy_bones> Woolie’s been training
[3:13:49] <+polothegreatest> nago mod OhMyDog
[3:13:53] <+cubbywolf> more like dickinson has been terrible
[3:13:54] <%Irridium> Nago's a rough matchup because he can literally just stand outside the range and react/counter everything he does LUL
[3:14:07] <hamahiroyuki> Oh, a good weirdo pick from One Piece: That one guy who rusted Zoro's sword in the end of one arc LUL
[3:14:08] <+cubbywolf> not reggie, but the character
[3:14:22] <NotHereToStream> any character with better normals will fuck gold lewis
[3:14:26] <Shad0wTag> As Pot main this all too familiar of a match up
[3:14:32] <+cubbywolf> he just seems bottom tier
[3:14:38] <+cubbywolf> doesnt meen he cant win
[3:14:45] <%Irridium> Imagine Pot without Hammerfall and that's Goldlewis
[3:14:48] <%CaptainPileDriver> i'll jump back in on strive when the patch comes out honestly and definetly to try out that second dlc character
[3:14:49] <andre11dr> If i had a wierdo pick i would go for Sandman from Part 7
[3:14:51] <Shad0wTag> @cubbywolf I wouldn't say he's worse than Faust or Anji
[3:15:04] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Yeah, poor Faust is Not Good in this game
[3:15:05] <%jinking79> my Dpad gave up on playing GolDick
[3:15:10] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> For like the first time ever it feels like
[3:15:10] <WakeUpThrow> Playing Lewis agaisnt Ram is suffering
[3:15:13] <andre11dr> Even tho i don't see how he would work in a fighting game LUL
[3:15:16] <%townzzzzz> GET YOUR MINDSET RIGHT
[3:15:25] <NotHereToStream> Axl against Goldlewis is hell
[3:15:33] <Shad0wTag> @wakeupthrow Is it worse than the Pot/Ram match up?
[3:15:37] <dandy_bones> Oh big time
[3:15:37] <Ardisan_> I played a match as Lewis against a Axl player and they were tbagging me while zoning
[3:15:47] <andre11dr> Axl is that bad?
[3:15:54] <Shad0wTag> @ardisan_ fuck em dude
[3:15:59] <NotHereToStream> axl just keeps you out
[3:16:00] <%Irridium> Oh a good Axl will literally never let you in. Lariet can stuff all goldie's long-range options and his normals are more than enough at mid-range
[3:16:00] <andre11dr> You'd think he could just shoot him
[3:16:12] <dandy_bones> It’s easy to get perfects with Axl against Goldlewis
[3:16:12] <bigshedman> So what actually makes the bombs come out during Goldlewis' super?
[3:16:13] <%CaptainPileDriver> axl players are worse than any blanka player.
[3:16:15] <NotHereToStream> no, the start up for the gun is half a second
[3:16:15] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:16:18] <+cubbywolf> I'm seeing a woolie versus watermark... is that new?
[3:16:25] <Shad0wTag> @bigshedman additional full circle motions
[3:16:25] <NotHereToStream> and the start up for the thunderbird is 57 fucking frames
[3:16:32] <%Irridium> @andre11dr minigun startup is super reactable
[3:16:33] <dandy_bones> Lewis can hardly touch Axl
[3:16:46] <WakeUpThrow> @Shad0wTag tbh if it's not worse, it sure feels like it
[3:16:57] <hamahiroyuki> @andre11dr I liked his story but his power felt too similar to Koichi. But he could dash in your face and throw a bunch of traps on your side tho.
[3:17:02] <bigshedman> @Shad0wTag Ooooh is that what it is? Cus I watched some of Max's streams and he's have the super with his glasses shattering but not the bombs coming out?
[3:17:05] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> It's a shame cause Goldlewis is super fun and has some goofy shit when it works.
[3:17:06] <+cubbywolf> maybe it was just the game
[3:17:15] <dandy_bones> Winter Mantis can totally shut down Thunderbird or Skyfish
[3:17:22] <%CaptainPileDriver> the only bois i enjoy are faust then anji, but both have major flaws
[3:17:28] <%thesickestzak> I wonder if that rumored ArcSys MHA game is real
[3:17:37] <dandy_bones> No way
[3:17:42] <Shad0wTag> @bigshedman so super has a full 360 motion and if you do a 1080 motion you get extra drones for big damage
[3:17:43] <+cubbywolf> its not
[3:17:47] <NotHereToStream> we'll see tomorrow the big announcements
[3:17:50] <Ardisan_> j. D
[3:17:53] <+cubbywolf> its not even a rumor
[3:17:59] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> @thesickestzak Last I looked it was in some kind of development hell, but it is/was real. Unless I'm thinking of a different one.
[3:18:04] <bigshedman> @Shad0wTag Ah I see. Thanks man!
[3:18:14] <@Solidus_113> Arcsys is working on too many games for another one to be announced
[3:18:26] <%CaptainPileDriver> you're not
[3:18:33] <NotHereToStream> in this behemoth typhoon, goldlewis gets fucked
[3:18:39] <andre11dr> @hamahiroyuki Oh and while where on this topic, my second pick is Magenta ,that dude is wierd LUL
[3:18:43] <Shad0wTag> @wakeupthrow As a Pot main it's pretty depressing for me and at least I have 'some' movement options to get in but Goldlewis looks like its even worse to deal witj
[3:18:55] <Shad0wTag> @bigshedman no prob dude
[3:19:04] <%jinking79> still waiting on new bout that Dungeon Fighter they're working on
[3:19:09] <%Axle13j> nice
[3:19:18] <Wynzler> I haven't seen this new character play yet, that is one MEATY BOY
[3:19:22] <hamahiroyuki> @andre11dr He's armor lock of Halo isn't? LUL
[3:19:28] <+vexion_smh> ohhh
[3:19:28] <BoxNavy> oh shit goldlewis
[3:19:33] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Goldlewis is a whole side of beef catmechNyooom
[3:19:54] <%baka_sugoi> owo
[3:20:02] <+vexion_smh> IN THIS BEHEMOTH TYPHOON
[3:20:13] <BoxNavy> SourPls
[3:20:22] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> The power of gun shoot
[3:20:22] <Shad0wTag> JP Goldlewis is so weird
[3:20:31] <NotHereToStream> j.D is gold lewis megafist
[3:20:40] <Shad0wTag> I am to used to my dulcet southern tones
[3:20:40] <BoxNavy> clean
[3:20:45] <andre11dr> @hamahiroyuki YEYEYEYE, also gotta love the reference to Kars
[3:20:49] <hakumaribo> In this behemoth Typhoon, you get your shit pushed in.
[3:20:54] <DSD24> Is that a Lupin color scheme for Goldlewis
[3:21:10] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> It could be, colors are right at least.
[3:21:21] <%CaptainPileDriver> where's the super butter churning goodness reggie
[3:21:24] <%CaptainPileDriver> churn that butter
[3:21:28] <DSD24> Even if it isn't he looks good with the red and yellow
[3:21:34] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Well, need a blue shirt and not black, but still in there.
[3:21:59] <%CaptainPileDriver> this is a bad matchup for lewis honestly.
[3:22:06] <Ardisan_> Like most
[3:22:10] <%CaptainPileDriver> yep
[3:22:23] <+OmegaZeroX2> doodLUL doodLUL doodLUL
[3:22:24] <Shad0wTag> I wanna say its like 7-3 at best
[3:22:25] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> l o l
[3:22:25] <%Irridium> his fuckin' 5P whiffs Giovanna raw man. pain.
[3:22:27] <andre11dr> He doesn't seem so bad against Nago
[3:22:52] <andre11dr> It seems like Nago can dash in fast enough and just maule him
[3:23:08] <andre11dr> He has better normals
[3:23:09] <%CaptainPileDriver> most players can too
[3:23:15] <BlackermanZX> reggie found the tech

[3:29:31] <hamahiroyuki> there was naruto 2d fighting games back in the PS2. the puppet character just moved with their puppets. was kinda missed oportunity
[3:29:32] <NotHereToStream> fight against ram as goldlewis is nothing but pain
[3:29:32] <CheyMix> @bruskiibru yesa hes from nigeria
[3:29:34] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> God This Song Rules: The Guilty Gear OST
[3:29:52] <%Irridium> Arcsys said they'll look into boosting older games' song volumes for a later patch thank god
[3:30:00] <andre11dr> Oh Jack-O ok that interesting
[3:30:03] <NotHereToStream> Korean ost yeah

[3:30:15] <+Dova573> I hope they add jukebox for lobby music too
[3:30:17] <gyrobasel> i wanted it to be happy chaos
[3:30:27] <+Parrish_broadnax> Happy chaos should be after Jack-o
[3:30:27] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:30:29] <andre11dr> People probably will be disappointed but i actually like Jack-O
[3:30:37] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> I just want Testament and Bridget catmechTired
[3:30:40] <DSD24> Jack O has a cool design
[3:30:40] <+Dova573> Woolie not using enough Bayoneto
[3:30:49] <Ardisan_> I just want new characters
[3:30:50] <+Dova573> I meant Reggie
[3:30:51] <+Parrish_broadnax> they said the next character would be returning, so that explains Jack-O Happy Chaos will probably be after her
[3:30:51] <%CaptainPileDriver> @gyrobasel he will definetly show up as one of them, we'll see when though, i figure it might be the last of the season 1 dlc cause it comes with a story mode continuation
[3:30:54] <+Vanderdeath> Zappa and ABA when tho, ArcSys
[3:30:59] <Ardisan_> and returnees that never returned in a long time
[3:31:00] <bigshedman> whens venom tho he da best
[3:31:06] <andre11dr> I like her more for her dirty ass gameplay but still like her LUL
[3:31:11] <+Parrish_broadnax> You would think after 3 PC ports they would stop putting the DLC list in the files
[3:31:12] <ShadowArcangel> M O R T O B A T O
[3:31:15] <+Parrish_broadnax> eogHee
[3:31:20] <JetpackMcQuack> where's the 30 second wall combo
[3:31:22] <+fetrigon> @vanderdeath I don't think Aba is coming back
[3:31:33] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> @Parrish_broadnax Japan gets mixed by PC datamining 10/0 almost every time
[3:31:52] <andre11dr> I'm really interested in Chaos, i hope his as crazy as Gold Dick
[3:31:55] <+Parrish_broadnax> Lol I still laugh every time when I think about the Fighterz Season 1 DLC list
[3:31:56] <+OmegaZeroX2> @andre11dr I wouldn't say that there's quite a few people that like Jack-O now how will she play in this game due to story implications will be very interesting mom0kaThonk
[3:32:04] <+Parrish_broadnax> It was on a TEXT DOCUMENT, like cmon guys
[3:32:07] <ShadowArcangel> There it is

[3:35:38] <+OmegaZeroX2> @andre11dr she did not
[3:35:46] <andre11dr> That's why they probably gave her that shit
[3:36:25] <InXplotch> Is that a modded nago color?
[3:36:25] <andre11dr> They where like "Nobody played this new caracter we made, well we'll show them"

[3:38:57] <+Rinoka> @bruskiibru use your air approach hitboxes and dash cancel 5K or 5H when Ram's in recovery frames
[3:39:17] <+Parrish_broadnax> Shoes, Scuffed
[3:39:24] <+OmegaZeroX2> @shad0wtag in her case for some people it was definitely the case because she has so many more options
[3:39:27] <%thesickestzak> HypeScream HypeScream HypeScream
[3:39:28] <andre11dr> I have to keep remind myself of the hitboxes buffs Nago gets
[3:39:35] <Ardisan_> Put some shoes on that Ram

[3:40:06] <Ardisan_> Get your shoes that clips on the floor
[3:40:26] <@Menitta> my favorite mod is still Totsugeki Potempkin
[3:40:28] <ShadowArcangel> LUL
[3:40:31] <InXplotch> Reggie you should end combos with 623p if your not close to a wall
[3:40:33] <Ardisan_> Did yall see the Ky sword mod
[3:40:33] <+Parrish_broadnax> thats a strong mod
[3:40:39] <Ardisan_> Looks really cool
[3:40:39] <bruskiibru> @rinoka Much appreciated, I'll keep that in mind
[3:40:43] <+Dova573> Thats such a Minh excuse lol
[3:40:48] <+Mrbaconator> @Menitta but sol making monkey noises and the pot mod that makes him say macho man randy savage lines
[3:40:51] <+Parrish_broadnax> Pepsi man Sol is still my favorite
[3:41:02] <+Parrish_broadnax> I just love him slamming people with a vending machine
[3:41:21] <bigshedman> Oh my lord I need to catch up on Strive mods LUL
[3:41:31] <andre11dr> Yeah Reggie is not using the double slam move enough, when Rams get meter they start wailing on that shit
[3:41:32] <@Menitta> theres also one that puts Ronaldinho Soccer over HPB
[3:41:35] <+brave_the_earth> Does Reggie's volume seem way high or is that just me?
[3:41:35] <%thesickestzak> JUST
[3:41:36] <%dustyjordans> i forgot there's a version of the game without steamed hams mod
[3:41:39] <%thesickestzak> DO IT

[3:41:52] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> I've been messing with Yakuzzi 0 mods lately and MAN, you can do some shit to that game and it's way more than I ever expected lol
[3:41:56] <Applecannon63> I wonder if Potemkin have a maskless mod?
[3:41:58] <InXplotch> Nago sword normals chip dont forget

[3:42:12] <+Parrish_broadnax> there is a maskless Pot mod yes
[3:42:15] <Applecannon63> @t_sasquatch its a mod
[3:42:16] <BoxNavy> slap slap slap slap
[3:42:18] <+TopTieramisu> the YSB of jab combos
[3:42:20] <+Parrish_broadnax> and a bagless faust mod
[3:42:28] <thackattack00> man seeing this game's UI without a tournament overlay or the network info feels kinda weird
[3:42:32] <Ardisan_> Topless Nago
[3:42:37] <Ardisan_> Ripped muscles
[3:42:38] <T_Sasquatch> @notheretostream @applecannon63 thanks LUL
[3:42:41] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> @brave_the_earth The ability to swap every model in the game, you can set every moveset in the game to Kiryu/Majima as well and they work perfect, can change properties on lots of moves and so on.
[3:42:44] <andre11dr> @newandtastysixthhouse Don't say that to loud, SEGA might send a hit squad to your house
[3:42:45] <%Irridium> mustached Sol mod is OD
[3:42:49] <hamahiroyuki> I'm getting flashback of Fo4 Paladin Danse Buzz Lightyear LUL

[3:43:06] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Playing Kiryu with like Shibusawa's moveset is crazy, they have so much shit.
[3:43:15] <Ardisan_> The female charactrs have the best mods, espeically May
[3:43:15] <%he1lhydra> DOMI
[3:43:27] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> There's also an Akiyama and Saejima moveset there in the game that can be used etc.
[3:43:33] <bruskiibru> "KIRYU-CHAAAAN" TriHard TriHard
[3:43:39] <+Parrish_broadnax> May doesnt just have alternate colors, she has full on Costumes lol
[3:43:55] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Hell, you can put movesets FROM OTHER YAKUZA GAMES in there, there's stuff to give Kiryu like his moves from Y5 and other stuff.
[3:43:58] <BlackermanZX> i saw a short haired May mod
[3:44:01] <Ardisan_> Im not a fan of the costumes that dont fit in the Strive art style though
[3:44:06] <Ardisan_> The textured ones
[3:44:19] <+Parrish_broadnax> agreed its why I like the pepsiman one
[3:44:26] <yukichocomilk> I play ram and nago is kinda rough for me
[3:44:27] <+Parrish_broadnax> it keeps pepsi man in the strive art style
[3:44:27] <%dustyjordans> need more Vtuber mods like Gawr Gura May mod
[3:44:30] <andre11dr> @newandtastysixthhouse Oh so you can get stuff like the cigarette move back?
[3:44:33] <andre11dr> I see
[3:44:39] <%Irridium> I will never uninstall Guy Fieri Goldlewis. Or KFC Goldlewis. Or Doug Dimmadome Goldlewis
[3:44:39] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:44:40] <+banjostevens> Jump dust reg!
[3:44:55] <+Parrish_broadnax> Irridium I have all of those
[3:45:00] <+Parrish_broadnax> and I will not be removing them
[3:45:01] <thackattack00> shoutouts to the guys on the Guilty Gear subreddit who keep posting videos with clickbait thumbnails of nude mod I-no
[3:45:08] <hamahiroyuki> I also remember for dbfz patrick star buu
[3:45:11] <Shad0wTag> @irridium Does Dimmadome have a tall ass hat?
[3:45:12] <andre11dr> I imagine its not that hard considering that most Yakuza games run on the same engine
[3:45:13] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> @andre11dr Possibly yeah, there's also like ACT mods, so whole other heat moves too. I've seen someone put the Fist of the North Star game movesets and heat moves in 0 LUL
[3:45:15] <BlackermanZX> Doug Dimmadome Lewis sounds strong
[3:45:23] <andre11dr> Or until Yakuza 6 that is
[3:45:23] <+Parrish_broadnax> He does have the tall hat
[3:45:24] <+Parrish_broadnax> yet
[3:45:28] <+Parrish_broadnax> *doesnt
[3:45:29] <%Irridium> @ShadowArcangel sadly not, but there is a voice mod
[3:45:39] <Applecannon63> I really hope we see the trailer reveal of dlc character
[3:45:42] <Shad0wTag> @irridium that'll do
[3:45:48] <Applecannon63> also no Spoilers
[3:45:58] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> And yeah, everything running on the Dragon Engine means you can move all sorts of stuff between games.
[3:46:10] <Shad0wTag> Guys whats the chance of us seeing the character reveal after evo grand finals for Strive?
[3:46:18] <andre11dr> @newandtastysixthhouse Wait how does that even work, does Kiryu just punch a dude and his heas explodes?
[3:46:20] <%dustyjordans> @Shad0wTag 100%
[3:46:20] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Someone ported Yagami's moveset from Judgement into 0 for Majima, along with his clothes lol
[3:46:27] <yukichocomilk> which track is this?
[3:46:35] <NotHereToStream> still in the dark
[3:46:36] <NotHereToStream> i think
[3:46:37] <%dustyjordans> @yukichocomilk Still in the Dark from GGX
[3:46:44] <yukichocomilk> ty!
[3:46:46] <Shad0wTag> @yukichocomilk Still in the dark from GGX
[3:46:55] <andre11dr> This is Still in The Dark yes
[3:47:01] <LorcaNomad> I haven't unlocked this song yet and it makes me sad
[3:47:02] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> @andre11dr Not sure on the big bloody explosion outcomes, but all the rush punching and so on is there.
[3:47:30] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Judgement Majima is fun as hell though.
[3:47:41] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Crane & Tiger moves all over the place
[3:48:00] <Applecannon63> I really hope they buff Nago's blood install were during burst he can cancel with his command normal combo
[3:48:01] <NotHereToStream> guess you can't mod in the wall run?
[3:48:05] <andre11dr> Ive been fucking around with that Dark Souls 3 mod lately
[3:48:21] <andre11dr> Boy that shit drops my fps
[3:48:30] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> @NotHereToStream Nah no wall run stuff that I saw, but all the rest of his very lithe moveset is there.
[3:48:46] <NotHereToStream> @NewAndTastySixthHouse pretty sick regardless of the wall run
[3:49:03] <+OmegaZeroX2> damn that screen tearing doodWat doodWat doodWat doodWat
[3:49:15] <Ipsenscastle> wow Reggie's hitting his stride
[3:49:25] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> That and all the unique movesets that like the arena bosses use can obviously be used, so that's some fun stuff. Full karate style and other stuff.
[3:49:42] <+OmegaZeroX2> @ipsenscastle Indeed doodOK
[3:49:48] <bruskiibru> I know we have Faust. but I hope he isn't the only trickt
[3:49:58] <InXplotch> Does woolie know he can spin out from the corner between the sword throw and before the explosion
[3:50:00] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Buff Faust catmechTired
[3:50:02] <hamahiroyuki> Ok, Imma ask: am I weird for liking the gyaru look of bleached hair and tanned skin?
[3:50:08] <bruskiibru> trickster*
[3:50:15] <+Parrish_broadnax> just a little taste
[3:50:16] <andre11dr> Yeah that's why you should be using the slam move more, you get so much meter
[3:50:20] <+Parrish_broadnax> a lil nibble
[3:50:34] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @hamahiroyuki nah, but there's a limit to it
[3:50:46] <Shad0wTag> @hamahiroyuki gyaru's are godtier and based
[3:50:51] <Demoli_PT> oh the super didnt break it
[3:50:58] <+Parrish_broadnax> My friend was fighting Extreme Nago yesterday Day on Stage 8. I didnt have the heart to tell him there was a stage 9
[3:50:59] <Demoli_PT> the sword explosion popped before it
[3:51:03] <%Irridium> shoutout to gyaru sushi
[3:51:05] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Back in my day they were ganguro girls KappaRoss
[3:51:13] <+OmegaZeroX2> @parrish_broadnax doodLUL doodLUL doodLUL
[3:51:18] <+Parrish_broadnax> eogHee
[3:51:25] <Applecannon63> I wonder after the inclusion of the 2nd DLC character, will they patch the roster?
[3:51:36] <+OmegaZeroX2> Let's go Ram doodmaxhype doodmaxhype doodmaxhype
[3:51:37] <hamahiroyuki> hmmm getting mixed awnsers here
[3:51:37] <Shad0wTag> @newandtastysixthhouse ganguro and gyaru are two different styled my guy!
[3:51:42] <$Giothegame> This warm ups for EVO?
[3:51:42] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1424943441079832577?s=19
[3:51:48] <NotHereToStream> they probably will do the patch, evo would be over and we can start the grind anew
[3:51:51] <andre11dr> @hamahiroyuki I don't hate it but i just don't understand what it supposed to be ,like are they supposed to be black people?
[3:51:53] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Damn, true enough HahaThink
[3:52:22] <+Parrish_broadnax> I thought the patch would come with Jack-o
[3:52:26] <FlowLethal> isnt Nagoriyuki japanese
[3:52:28] <Applecannon63> @andre11dr I always thought its their ver of going brazillian
[3:52:30] <Shad0wTag> @andre11dr their emulating western fashion sense and culture typically american girls since gyaru is meant to sound like gal in english
[3:52:37] <+OmegaZeroX2> nice Reggie doodGood
[3:52:40] <+Infeirno23> @andre11dr its the brown skin without having to entertain the idea of finding a black person attractive Kappa
[3:52:49] <+Infeirno23> thats why i dont really likeit
[3:52:52] <%townzzzzz> very tan blonde gals
[3:52:55] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Also lmao one other dumb one for Y0, there's a mod someone made that just buffs Kiryu up to Mr Shakedown's size, so all the enemies are manlet sized after that LUL
[3:53:04] <bigshedman> @Infeirno23 That sounds so fucking harsh but real LUL
[3:53:05] <+OmegaZeroX2> @flowlethal no he's not
[3:53:18] <Shad0wTag> @infeirno23 but gyaru isn't exactly emulating black culture or acting like their a black persom
[3:53:21] <bruskiibru> @flowlethal he's Nigerian
[3:53:23] <%Irridium> maybe they just wanna emulate their hero, Justin Trudeou?
[3:53:43] <+Infeirno23> @shad0wtag nah i meant the aesthetic of brown skin
[3:53:48] <andre11dr> @infeirno23 Yeah that's probably more real than we would like the think
[3:54:00] <hamahiroyuki> @andre11dr no, it's usually tanned japanese people, witch isnt the most common taste in japan
[3:54:13] <Shad0wTag> @infeirno23 couldn't you make that argument for whenever anyone tans their skin?
[3:54:30] <ImPrettyBadAtTheGame> I'm stealing all your nago tech woolie
[3:54:32] <andre11dr> Sometimes they're actually Africans tho
[3:54:35] <Lancaster_H> i always thought of gyaru as valley girl equivalent for japan
[3:54:39] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> And I mean there's also naturally pretty tan japanese people, what used to be the Ryukyus and stuff.
[3:54:47] <andre11dr> Like Elena in SF3
[3:54:49] <Shad0wTag> @newandtastysixthhouse okinawa as well
[3:54:55] <+Infeirno23> @shad0wtag maybe? idk the tan look in anime/manga looks nothing like actual tan skin, more like brown skin
[3:55:01] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Okinawa included in that very much yeah
[3:55:10] <andre11dr> And I'm pretty sure K dash isn't Japanese
[3:55:28] <bigshedman> I thought K' was South American?
[3:55:29] <Applecannon63> @flowlethal he's suppose to be based on Yasuke both foreign samurais
[3:55:57] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Yasuke's history is neat, though it also kind of just ends a bit after Honnoji sadly lol
[3:56:22] <andre11dr> It's the Netflix thing good?
[3:56:30] <%Irridium> not really, sadly
[3:56:32] <NotHereToStream> retainer to nobunaga right? of all people LUL
[3:56:34] <bigshedman> The Yasuke show? No it's not great.
[3:56:36] <andre11dr> Ahh ok
[3:56:42] <JetpackMcQuack> No touch monkaS
[3:56:59] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> @NotHereToStream Yep, he originally came to japan with the christians, Nobunaga saw him, later got him in his service for a while.
[3:57:03] <Shad0wTag> @infeirno23 I'm black myself but I don't see the act of getting a tan to be trying to emulate black skin. I mean people tan naturally in most cases and that can't be controlled. However if the intent is to literally trick folks into thinking your black then yeah that's bad.
[3:57:04] <bigshedman> It actually looks pretty nice but it's so poorly paced and just a mashup of anime things/tropes, it's not worth the watch.
[3:57:22] <+OroOreo> The theme is by thundercat though so that’s tight
[3:57:25] <cornerstorecoroner> ^but if ur into that its hella tight
[3:57:28] <andre11dr> I asked cause Ive been listening fo that Flying Lotus soundtrack a lot ,and i was like maybe i should watch this
[3:57:30] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> And then Nobunaga dies at Honnoji, Yasuke regroups with the Oda, does a little more, gets captured by the Akechi, they escort him to a missionary and his history sort of ends there.
[3:57:38] <+Parrish_broadnax> Reggie: my privilge
[3:57:41] <InXplotch> It seems like woolie doesnt really know the matchup. Nago has some good punishes on ram
[3:58:10] <NotHereToStream> right akechi betrayed nobunaga
[3:58:10] <bigshedman> @andre11dr Put on the soundtrack, watch some clips on Youtube to look at the animation and you'll save yourself a few hours.
[3:58:17] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Yep
[3:58:28] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> And then the Akechi get brutally shitstomped by Hideyoshi lmao
[3:58:30] <%dustyjordans> C O U N T E R
[3:58:48] <+Infeirno23> @shad0wtag i dont have a problem with tanning, i just meant gyaru's in manga and anime feel like loophole to having a black looking character without actually having to have one
[3:58:48] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:58:52] <Applecannon63> why the hell is the name akechi is always branded traitor
[3:58:55] <+Infeirno23> if that makes sense
[3:59:00] <hamahiroyuki> Yasuke shows up in Nioh 2 but for some reason he speak english
[3:59:00] <flubdy_> Is Woolie playing against Reggie rn?
[3:59:02] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> The Akechi were literally banking on the idea that Hideyoshi's forces would be tied up with the Mori, Hideyoshi brokers peace with them in record time, doubles back and fuckin tears the Akecki up bad.
[3:59:03] <+BettyMwwaahh> i know all this stuff. i played Nioh 1 and 2
[3:59:07] <Valentine_Evelyn> give this man some water he's choking
[3:59:39] <+Dova573> Reggie you thinking too much
[3:59:41] <+Dova573> Kappa
[3:59:51] <bruskiibru> I can really play Nioh right now, still gotta finish it
[4:00:07] <+OmegaZeroX2> doodmaxhype doodmaxhype doodmaxhype
[4:00:21] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> And the best part is always that Mitsuhide Akechi flees the battle like at the behest of his guys, gets a ways out and while passing through a village, gets jumped by a highwayman gang and stabbed to death lmao
[4:00:37] <bigshedman> LUL
[4:00:43] <%Irridium> @NewAndTastySixthHouse big "I'm a genius! oh no!" energy
[4:00:46] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Smoked by a guy who wanted your pocket change
[4:00:55] <+OmegaZeroX2> @newandtastysixthhouse wow doodLUL doodLUL doodLUL
[4:01:00] <NotHereToStream> japanese history is fucked LUL
[4:01:10] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> That whole era of history has some great shit.
[4:01:18] <Demoli_PT> imagine trying to burst vs ram
[4:01:21] <andre11dr> All History is really fucked
[4:01:29] <NotHereToStream> true
[4:01:43] <andre11dr> European history is really fucked
[4:01:53] <+OmegaZeroX2> damn the bait
[4:01:54] <Hydrapissed> all history is lol
[4:02:07] <Shad0wTag> -awkwardly looks at british history-
[4:02:10] <andre11dr> Because they went and fucked the other histories too
[4:02:15] <+OmegaZeroX2> doodLUL doodLUL doodLUL doodLUL
[4:02:28] <NotHereToStream> I just think the genghis khan period was really fucked
[4:02:28] <bruskiibru> @andre11dr Lmao
[4:02:31] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> What's always kind of funny too is that dramatized stuff shows the Akechi killing Nobunaga, but what happened was they had him dead to rights and let him just seppuku out.
[4:02:34] <+AngriestAngryArtist> wake up supers all day
[4:03:07] <bigshedman> Hey man my country's history is great! We defeated the Spanish and then we did nothing bad at all everything was great :)
[4:03:35] <andre11dr> @notheretostream The dude literally killed a third of the human population of that time
[4:03:38] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Really that's how a whole lot of the major japanese guys went out, lost a battle bad, surrounded or otherwise backed into a corner, then given the chance to knife themself and they do it to it.
[4:04:08] <Shad0wTag> @newandtastysixthhouse I will never understand the honourable seppuku for real
[4:04:21] <NotHereToStream> @andre11dr and breeded a lot, god knows how many of the asian population are still directly a descendent of that man
[4:04:36] <andre11dr> He killed so many people that habiyats changed because of the rotting corpses
[4:04:44] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Shingen Takeda actually died out in the field though, history is kind of split up on whether it was a sniper wound that later did him in or that an old wound opened and they couldn't fix it.
[4:04:56] <NotHereToStream> yeah, o2 consumption was reduced in that time
[4:04:57] <InXplotch> Chip daaamnmage
[4:05:07] <LorcaNomad> @NotHereToStream literally every day of the year is a birthday of his descendants it's insane
[4:05:27] <%Afterman_> slap
[4:05:38] <NotHereToStream> @LorcaNomad motherfucker better prepare some gifts in hell LUL
[4:05:40] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> @Shad0wTag To a degree it was pretty much just like, the most major type of concede you could give if you were totally beat.
[4:06:23] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:06:23] <andre11dr> Man this a Strive stream how did we get into history talk LUL
[4:06:32] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> catmechOmegaLUL
[4:06:35] <%Irridium> oh right they're playing Strive
[4:06:39] <andre11dr> I don't mind it ,just find it funny
[4:06:54] <+OmegaZeroX2> @andre11dr because it started by asking if Nago is Japanese doodLUL doodLUL doodLUL doodLUL
[4:06:56] <bruskiibru> Wait do you have to be close up for the full Nago super?
[4:06:57] <bigshedman> history is lit bro!
[4:07:08] <CheyMix> @andre11dr mankind could not change society but insted of reflecting on them selfs they blamed the beasts
[4:07:09] <NotHereToStream> wonder what made nago hate crabs
[4:07:13] <LorcaNomad> isn't there a theory that nago is yasuke?
[4:07:18] <%townzzzzz> woolie is breaking LUL
[4:07:27] <velozen> woolie looking exasperated
[4:07:35] <+OmegaZeroX2> @lorcanomad he is based off of Yasuke
[4:07:42] <andre11dr> Nago is not even human
[4:07:57] <andre11dr> Like are people born vampires in this universe
[4:08:11] <andre11dr> Or does someone have to bite you?
[4:08:19] <LorcaNomad> I fucking love that nago is a vampire mega-weeb so much
[4:08:22] <bigshedman> Isn't his line about being a retainer to Kazunosuke supposed to imply that he is the historical Yasuke?
[4:08:32] <NotHereToStream> quick, back to the woolies video on GG
[4:08:34] <InXplotch> He did it!
[4:08:35] <+chief_chongo> im starting to think I'm gonna have to learn nago
[4:08:37] <NotHereToStream> what the hell are the nightless
[4:08:41] <+OmegaZeroX2> @andre11dr well that still doesn't stop you from having a nationality and who knows
[4:08:48] <+chief_chongo> @notheretostream blade
[4:09:01] <NotHereToStream> there is a blade mode for nago
[4:09:09] <NotHereToStream> mod*
[4:09:09] <+0dinpen> nightless are just vampires
[4:09:10] <Meltgar> Ram is such a pain to get hit by the swords
[4:09:18] <Zombrocom> 5F
[4:09:21] <Meltgar> get hit once, you get either wallbreaked or worse
[4:09:33] <+chief_chongo> rams wall strategy is such bs yet i keep dying to it
[4:09:40] <+chief_chongo> so i cant blame the beasts
[4:09:43] <andre11dr> @omegazerox2 But vampires have their own nationality in this universe, they have ancestors they are HUGE
[4:09:44] <+0dinpen> didnt expect reggie to play ram
[4:09:45] <+Twistedoldham> Vampires are so ridiculous in GG if Nago and Slayer are anything to go by
[4:09:54] <+Prinny_Raider> Ram 5p 5f. 2p 6f
[4:10:00] <NotHereToStream> it all makes sense when you realise slayers opening involves him sucking sharon dry of blood to prevent blood rage mid fight
[4:10:13] <+OmegaZeroX2> @andre11dr I guess so mom0kaThonk
[4:10:20] <hamahiroyuki> ok, is there any other former colony that got better than the colonist that the king chose to stick around after running from Europe or is that just Brazil?
[4:10:22] <+chief_chongo> yeah nago just gotta find an immortal gf with magic blood problem solved
[4:10:27] <+OmegaZeroX2> @0dinpen me neither
[4:10:49] <+OmegaZeroX2> @chief_chongo doodLUL doodLUL doodLUL
[4:10:50] <+dakarplaugas> @odinpen of course he plays Ram she has no shoes
[4:10:58] <+0dinpen> lmao true
[4:11:00] <+chief_chongo> @hamahiroyuki which part of brazils history do you mean? pedro 2 was exiled
[4:11:01] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> The Reggie feet lore continues
[4:11:22] <bruskiibru> I love Slayer'e intro mainly because of Sharon flying away in the background lol
[4:11:26] <andre11dr> Doesn't say Slayer nationality in one of the old GGs?
[4:11:26] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> catmechStep
[4:11:36] <andre11dr> I think he is Romanian
[4:11:37] <+Twistedoldham> While Slayer was off being happily married, Nago studied the blade
[4:11:50] <+chief_chongo> slayer from wallachia
[4:11:51] <Applecannon63> China's history is fucked for how much it broke apart it's nation
[4:11:54] <velozen> slapped
[4:11:55] <Shad0wTag> We need am Ozzy Osbourne mod so we can hear him say SHAAAARON
[4:11:56] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Jabbed like it's SFV KappaRoss
[4:12:02] <andre11dr> Which would be cool, we don't get many reps in these games
[4:12:15] <hamahiroyuki> @chief_chongo Dom Pedro 2 was actually born Brazilian. The First ran as a Prince from the megalomaniac French manlet.
[4:12:19] <andre11dr> We have like Slayer and Dmitri LUL
[4:12:31] <Applecannon63> The fuck happen to Slayer after xrd?
[4:12:33] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> @Applecannon63 It's been dramatized so much, but the actual like ROT3K era of china is nuts.
[4:12:44] <Shad0wTag> @applecannon63 so far absolutely nothing
[4:12:54] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> The reality of Lu Bu was "Do not trust Lu Bu (Ever)"
[4:13:06] <NotHereToStream> dunno what happened to slayer, but we know that the VA for slayer passed away unfortunately

[4:13:18] <Shad0wTag> @newandtastysixthhouse Accept Chen Gong trusted him right?
[4:13:21] <Meltgar> @NotHereToStream OH FUCK, i didn't heard that one
[4:13:22] <%Afterman_> @NewAndTastySixthHouse dude was super untrustworthy lmao
[4:13:42] <+chief_chongo> slayer was gonna rebuild the assassins guild but that is part of the illyrian gov now so i think hes judt chillin
[4:13:42] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:13:49] <+OmegaZeroX2> doodLUL doodLUL doodLUL
[4:13:49] <%townzzzzz> LUL
[4:13:50] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Lu Bu was like, an actual very competent commander and all, that part's true, but he fucked over virtually everyone he worked with after lmao
[4:13:52] <Lancaster_H> LUL
[4:13:55] <Johannen> LUL
[4:13:57] <Demoli_PT> oh i can SEE the salt flowing
[4:13:58] <Lancaster_H> YOU COME AT THE KING
[4:14:11] <+Prinny_Raider> No supers put you in counter hit state
[4:14:12] <tukds> Woolie is seething
[4:14:14] <Demoli_PT> supers dont get counter hit state after the super
[4:14:15] <andre11dr> See that's why Ram is bullshit
[4:14:22] <Demoli_PT> only DPs, Projectiles and Command Throws
[4:14:31] <%Afterman_> @NewAndTastySixthHouse didnt he end up dying because someone betrayed and tricked him, mostly because of his unloyal nature?
[4:14:32] <+chief_chongo> i love rams design and she is cute but god i hate her so much
[4:14:36] <Meltgar> Anji has to do the animation of the counter, RAM JUST DOES IT
[4:14:38] <andre11dr> And Reggie isn't even doing the corner trap shit
[4:14:50] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> It took so many turnarounds from Lu Bu until eventually he was on the losing end of Cao Cao, tried to get in with him and the Wei went "Fuckin lol, nah" and chopped him.
[4:14:57] <+chief_chongo> corner trap shit is literally all i see from rams
[4:15:07] <+chief_chongo> so this is kinda interesting at least
[4:15:12] <andre11dr> Where you just have to guess when she stops
[4:15:27] <hamahiroyuki> ALSO Dom Pedro II was got in throne as a "coup" by lowering the  age of ruling to 14. It was more like the from the transition government generals just kinda pushed the kid cuz they didn't want any of resposabilty
[4:15:49] <%SandcrawlerF1> SandcrawlerF1 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months, currently on a 13 month streak! 
[4:16:01] <big_oki> what nago jab startup?
[4:16:07] <NotHereToStream> 5f i think
[4:16:13] <CheyMix> grab is 2 frames right
[4:16:20] <NotHereToStream> yes
[4:16:27] <+chief_chongo> tbf my brazilian history knowledge is patchy at best. but they have done a lot better in ways than former colonies
[4:16:28] <andre11dr> That's a good idea, let's be ruled by a kid what could possibly go wrong
[4:16:28] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> The Shu boys in history are also interesting in their real life counterparts. Liu Bei was a super charismatic speaker, but cut and run on a lot of people. Guan Yu's greatest issue was apparently that he was super in love with himself.
[4:16:30] <big_oki> nice
[4:16:38] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> And Zhang Fei is a whole can of worms in the real history sense lol
[4:17:09] <Mach5Mike> Anyone else here play Strive during EVO online this year?
[4:17:10] <+thefistcake> Hello Kings and Queens and Nonbinary Royalty!
[4:17:18] <big_oki> the ram cycle
[4:17:34] <andre11dr> There's a reason why we don't let kids rull countrys anymore, kids are to distracted by pussy to make right decisions
[4:17:41] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Zhang Fei was such a strict asshole, even for the time, that was so abusive to prisoners, peasants and his own men, that that's what did him in in the end LUL
[4:17:48] <big_oki> AYO GUILTY GEAR
[4:17:50] <+chief_chongo> i am such traah at getting out of the corner NotLikeThis
[4:17:52] <big_oki> this song is hype
[4:17:54] <hamahiroyuki> ALSO Pedro 1 got went back to Portugal after the people start rioting demanding his return.
[4:18:07] <%Afterman_> @NewAndTastySixthHouse  got any ma chao stories
[4:18:10] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Zhang Fei went out to scout a little with two of his like lieutenants, they ride a ways out, his two men pulled him off his horse, stabbed the shit out of him, bagged his head and went to the Wu with it.
[4:18:22] <+chief_chongo> nerf her goddamn swords
[4:18:27] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> "LOOK, DUDES, LET US IN"
[4:18:30] <hamahiroyuki> *went back only after
[4:19:04] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> @Afterman_ None that immediately come to mind, but there's some wild shit to practically every major figure of that time.
[4:19:13] <hamahiroyuki> the history of Brazil makes Portugal look kinda bad tbf LUL
[4:19:22] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Sun Quan has a whole slew of weird stories from history lol
[4:19:23] <andre11dr> Back in the day you could just ice super important people and completely get away with it
[4:19:42] <%Irridium> man doing crimes must have been so fucking easy in the past lol
[4:19:47] <bigshedman> The good ol' days Kappa
[4:19:54] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> It very much was for a lot of people lol
[4:20:00] <%Afterman_> do a crime then pin it on some ancient spirit
[4:20:04] <andre11dr> "Who killed this dude"  "Fuck if i know, let's blame this random guy"
[4:20:04] <bruskiibru> @newandtastysixthhouse What happened to Zhang Fei seems savage af
[4:20:06] <+chief_chongo> escobar put a bomb on a plane like it was nothing
[4:20:12] <%Irridium> do a crime and just fuckin' leave
[4:20:23] <andre11dr> There's no video
[4:20:39] <andre11dr> Fuck you don't even have footprints
[4:20:43] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> @bruskiibru Oh yeah Zhang Fei got it real hard, but he was also totally asking for it in history, he was probably the most actual accomplished man of the time, but he was a giant abusive dickhead nobody liked LUL
[4:20:44] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1424943441079832577?s=19
[4:21:03] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> You beat on your own men enough, someone's gonna get tired of it.
[4:21:07] <%Afterman_> man just dont be a dick
[4:21:14] <bigshedman> Quick! Someone send a letter to the police so they can show up next month and stop this crime LUL
[4:21:17] <%Afterman_> i get not stabbed everyday by being a not dick
[4:21:25] <andre11dr> You don't even fully have an understanding of biology, there's no way you could ever find out who did the murder
[4:21:39] <+0dinpen> this is my evo gfs
[4:21:44] <hamahiroyuki> like imagine if Queen Victoria had to leave with the tail between the legs London to be burned by the - adunno - the Germans and made Washington the new capital
[4:21:45] <+itsOnyxLeo> why does this song sound like Ram Ranch? lmao
[4:22:00] <Shad0wTag> @newandtastysixthhouse What happened with Cheng Gong and Lu Bu, did he get betrayed too?
[4:22:45] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> @Shad0wTag Real history Chen Gong died with Lu Bu pretty much.
[4:23:43] <Lancaster_H> LUL
[4:23:44] <Applecannon63> NotLikeThis
[4:23:44] <+0dinpen> jesus christ lmao
[4:23:46] <%Irridium> LUL
[4:23:47] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Though he also got a nice sendoff, Cao Cao respected that Chen Gong wouldn't go back to his original post pretty much and accepted dying with Lu Bu, so put his family on some money and such after.
[4:24:01] <andre11dr> Oh yeah, evo exists, i keep forgetting about it
[4:24:02] <+0dinpen> which way do you guess for that sajamVibe sajamVibe
[4:24:17] <andre11dr> Nobody is really talking about it still LUL
[4:24:23] <%Afterman_> @NewAndTastySixthHouse  man is cao cao actually as cool as koei makes him seem
[4:24:57] <andre11dr> That takes away so much meter
[4:25:01] <+0dinpen> wei got alot of the cool designs
[4:25:04] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Historic Cao Cao was pretty cool for the most part. One thing you have to remember is that Romance of the Three Kingdoms, as in the novel and dramatization, was written in a time where essentially the follow-up to the Shu were in power.
[4:25:17] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> So the Shu got a lot of whitewashing, while the Wei and Wu were put down a lot.
[4:25:20] <Applecannon63> I wonder if they'll include Raven again in the next dlc season
[4:25:34] <andre11dr> I hope they do
[4:25:53] <andre11dr> I kinda mained him in Rev a little
[4:25:58] <Applecannon63> Dude has an interesting role
[4:26:23] <andre11dr> I hope they keep the version where he gets excitement from moves
[4:26:27] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> ^
[4:26:32] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Raven was a neat weirdo lol
[4:26:48] <andre11dr> Raven played really interesting
[4:26:59] <NotHereToStream> funny how you speak of raven since he lived throughout the history of the world
[4:27:00] <bruskiibru> I want Sin to join the roster, he's pretty cool to me
[4:27:17] <andre11dr> A lot of time spent in the air, flying into people
[4:27:48] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Historic Sun Quan had it real hard as another neat one. Sun Jian dies to a stray arrow from a routing army, Sun Ce dies from getting sick on long marching, Sun Quan when he came into power was already pretty jaded and done with shit.
[4:27:49] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:27:54] <Shad0wTag> @bruskiibru meat meter and all?
[4:28:03] <Applecannon63> thinks Sin will be include in the next GG game as probably as a new Ky
[4:28:05] <andre11dr> And excitment was a cool mechanic, absorb damage and get better
[4:28:26] <+0dinpen> 2fs bby
[4:28:30] <SpookyMooks> seems pretty tight
[4:28:57] <hamahiroyuki> Did Nago just kinda slide out scene just now? LUL
[4:28:59] <andre11dr> I wouldn't mind if they kept Sin away from this game
[4:29:09] <%Sparkseid> sajamSolphisticated
[4:29:23] <+0dinpen> sajamSolphisticated
[4:29:35] <andre11dr> That caracter had stupid range with stupider damage
[4:29:41] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Sin's cute though catmechMeowles
[4:29:50] <+0dinpen> sins a good boy
[4:29:55] <+0dinpen> he eats all his meals
[4:29:59] <Applecannon63> very risk reward with his calorie mechanic
[4:30:01] <andre11dr> @newandtastysixthhouse Not worth
[4:30:27] <+CrispiestOfWills> Isn't that the thing where there's like a 2 frame window on the spin to LAUNCH yourself across the screen?
[4:30:42] <Applecannon63> it would make Nago's look like a joke
[4:30:57] <andre11dr> Yeah it was
[4:31:27] <andre11dr> But Sin would be a night for Nago either way
[4:31:33] <hamahiroyuki> did any other crew member from May's pirate crew ever showed up as a character?
[4:31:41] <andre11dr> His basically him but better
[4:31:44] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Johnny KappaRoss
[4:31:53] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> But none of the other Jellyfish Pirates I can think of
[4:31:57] <+0dinpen> for some weird reason i thought april was playable once
[4:32:05] <andre11dr> More reward les risc
[4:32:06] <bruskiibru> @shad0wtag I had to think about it a bit haha. Honestly, a rework without the meat meter would be nice for me.
[4:32:11] <@Solidus_113> !uptime
[4:32:11] <@Moobot> @Solidus_113 WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 4 hours and 46 minutes
[4:32:44] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Reggie with the throws tho
[4:32:55] <hamahiroyuki> not even just in story?
[4:33:23] <andre11dr> All the other new Xrd caracters would be cool in this tho
[4:33:38] <andre11dr> Actually i take that back
[4:33:41] <Applecannon63> Kum would've been interesting to return
[4:33:46] <andre11dr> Fuck Elephant
[4:33:53] <Raven_In_A_Tree> Jellyfish pirates dont matter. other than johnny and may. although dizzy was with them a while
[4:33:57] <andre11dr> KEEP THAT HO AWAY
[4:34:01] <Demoli_PT> no audience fights today?
[4:34:12] <+0dinpen> can you just do the fs target combo?
[4:34:13] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Kliff for DLC when KappaRoss
[4:34:24] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Ghost mode
[4:34:26] <Applecannon63> I mean Elphet is already benched story wise
[4:34:33] <bruskiibru> @andre11dr LMAO. What's wrong with a little fps in a fighting game lol
[4:34:39] <%Sparkseid> @demoli_pt i doubt it
[4:34:51] <%townzzzzz> LUL

[4:34:53] <SpookyMooks> nooo reggie
[4:34:55] <Lancaster_H> LUL
[4:34:57] <blackkanye> YOOO
[4:35:02] <+0dinpen> justice
[4:35:05] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Reggie catmechBabyrage
[4:35:08] <+thefistcake> "I'm a genius! OH NO"
[4:35:09] <CarmineAcciai> Dude, this is the same match my sparring partner and I have.
[4:35:11] <andre11dr> @bruskiibru Ask Injustice players
[4:35:19] <+0dinpen> LUL @thefistcake
[4:35:23] <CarmineAcciai> I also bait the wakeup super like that xD
[4:35:29] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Man I loved Deathstroke in IJ1 catmechGun
[4:35:38] <+MK_Ineptitude> they runnin a lobby later?
[4:35:53] <Lancaster_H> c o u n t e r
[4:35:58] <SpookyMooks> what's this on?
[4:36:03] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> PC
[4:36:08] <Applecannon63> Honestly Justice should return to all her glory in the next guilty gear
[4:36:19] <andre11dr> But yeah besides Elephant and Sin I'm ok with every other Xrd newcomer coming back
[4:36:36] <Raven_In_A_Tree> the fact that burger sheriff's brother was playable before Asuka is a crime
[4:36:45] <bruskiibru> @andre11dr Lol, you're definitely not wrong with Injustice
[4:36:49] <Applecannon63> or eitherway have dizzy become Justice form
[4:36:51] <CarmineAcciai> Ram is an... interesting matchup for Nago given they occupy the same range.
[4:37:13] <Applecannon63> I want me some robo dragon-like wives
[4:37:17] <andre11dr> Kum is cool ,Answer is really cool never saw much of him tho
[4:37:29] <CarmineAcciai> @andre11dr My roommate plays Answer.
[4:37:43] <CarmineAcciai> I'm told there isn't a lot of Answer Players.
[4:37:43] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Justice would be sick to see again. Answer was cool, but too galaxy brain for a lot of people.
[4:37:47] <+0dinpen> your roommate lives a great life
[4:37:48] <WakeUpThrow> I can't IMAGINE how Answer would play in Strive
[4:37:54] <ZeroCount> From what I remember Answer just wasn't very good. He's cool though
[4:38:04] <Applecannon63> Answers is Chipp but with Jutsu sign gimmicks
[4:38:05] <CarmineAcciai> I got lucky, whole household plays Guilty xD
[4:38:14] <WakeUpThrow> He would probably get completely overhauled
[4:38:15] <andre11dr> Yeah i actually couldn't tell you what Answer don't, i know he zips to stuff that's about it
[4:38:29] <CarmineAcciai> I do Johnny/Nago, Husbando does Elphelt/Goldlewis, Roomies play Answer and Venom/Potemkin.
[4:38:33] <andre11dr> He has like cards and shit
[4:38:34] <bruskiibru> I forgot about Answer! He'd be sick on here. Chipp vs Answer would be interesting to watch on Strive
[4:38:51] <hamahiroyuki> so, in the GG lore did Japan got erased or something?
[4:38:59] <andre11dr> Yeah
[4:39:08] <CarmineAcciai> @hamahiroyuki Justice basically blew it off the map with a giant laser.
[4:39:11] <Raven_In_A_Tree> Japan got exploded by asuka and justice
[4:39:13] <BlackermanZX> japan got nuked by justice
[4:39:14] <blackkanye> Nuked/Gamma Ray'd
[4:39:15] <andre11dr> Twice actually
[4:39:21] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Japan's super ded for the most part in GG lore, like Baiken and Anji are some of the only notable left.
[4:39:23] <+Issun135> First time seeing who reggie plays.  I dont know why i expected any different
[4:39:31] <+fetrigon> the whiff mixup
[4:39:35] <+fetrigon> nice
[4:39:46] <Raven_In_A_Tree> May's japanese
[4:39:51] <hamahiroyuki> but Brazil still exist?
[4:39:57] <blackkanye> I know right
[4:40:00] <CarmineAcciai> Start of the round Neutral is a crapshoot. I usually jump dust with Nago or spin.
[4:40:03] <Raven_In_A_Tree> which is simultaneously very important and doesn't matter at all
[4:40:08] <CarmineAcciai> I don't know what 6K can stuff.
[4:40:12] <andre11dr> All these fake Woolie fans not knowing the GG lore Kappa
[4:40:12] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> @Issun135 catmechStep
[4:40:13] <ZeroCount> He played Millia.... Why the change?
[4:40:25] <andre11dr> Y'all need to watch those videos
[4:40:26] <+fetrigon> pfffft
[4:40:27] <hamahiroyuki> did we atleast revived Dom Pedro II?
[4:40:42] <+fetrigon> nice ult
[4:40:59] <SpookyMooks> a lethal ram
[4:41:04] <ZeroCount> ramLethal
[4:41:24] <+Issun135> he dead.
[4:41:34] <andre11dr> Oh actually there's one more Xrd caracters i don't want back
[4:41:35] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> If we revive some major south americans, bring Allende back FeelsBadMan
[4:41:39] <andre11dr> Bedman
[4:41:53] <andre11dr> What a lame ass design
[4:41:54] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:42:23] <andre11dr> I know some people will disagree but I'm not a fan of Bedman
[4:42:25] <hamahiroyuki> @andre11dr bruh I was already into fucking Kingdom Hearts b4 I even watched super best friends give me a break Kappa
[4:42:32] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Bedman was cute catmechGasm
[4:42:56] <+OctaivianRex> Damn, nice Reggie
[4:43:00] <WakeUpThrow> Eh, Bedman is pretty interesting (I hate the design too though)
[4:43:07] <Raven_In_A_Tree> I'd rather get Gabriel than badman

[4:43:15] <bruskiibru> Bedman is alright, I like his gameplay more than the design
[4:43:23] <hamahiroyuki> did Canada survived in GG?
[4:43:25] <andre11dr> Gameplay is cool
[4:43:25] <WakeUpThrow> Probably NEVER coming back due to lore
[4:43:43] <+0dinpen> i'll take a new bedperson
[4:43:46] <LorcaNomad> @NewAndTastySixthHouse By this logic so is happy chaos
[4:44:05] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> He is catmechGasm
[4:44:20] <andre11dr> Leaving moves in place to hit you is really cool
[4:44:23] <CarmineAcciai> I have never seen a Bedman player.
[4:44:25] <+0dinpen> happy chaos atleast hints that he can comeback @LorcaNomad
[4:44:31] <andre11dr> But he still looks lame
[4:44:52] <point4effort> Does Reggie main Ram?
[4:45:03] <hamahiroyuki> what are the countries least likely to survive the GG universe?
[4:45:07] <Applecannon63> Gabriel must be Playable
[4:45:07] <andre11dr> Also some the most boring tournament matches i saw in Xrd was Bedman mirrors
[4:45:09] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Living Trash was a real cool Bedman player
[4:45:20] <LorcaNomad> @hamahiroyuki Australia is apparently totally fucked in lore I think
[4:45:30] <andre11dr> I think it was the only time i saw a time over in Xrd
[4:45:34] <+0dinpen> majin obama vs jiyuna is a great set lol
[4:45:42] <+0dinpen> obama played bedman
[4:45:46] <Applecannon63> Austraila is fucked because Gears
[4:46:23] <LorcaNomad> Bioweapon takeover, which hilariously enough isn't far off from real world australia
[4:46:31] <hamahiroyuki> Yeah, but the Aussies already get rough IRL tho LUL
[4:46:32] <CarmineAcciai> I had to get into the habit of being more aggressive with my blood being low, especially going 214H > 623P > 236K > stuff.
[4:46:51] <andre11dr> However I'd still rather have Bedman baback instead of Elephant
[4:46:51] <CarmineAcciai> Err, 623H, not 623P
[4:46:52] <bruskiibru> My favorite character to play in Xrd for sure was Jam. She's so fun to play, I'd lose my shit if she popped up
[4:47:02] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Knowing australia, velociraptors probably still exist there in a lost cave somewhere.
[4:47:09] <andre11dr> I hate that character
[4:47:14] <andre11dr> HATE HER
[4:47:19] <andre11dr> WHY
[4:47:35] <andre11dr> WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS
[4:47:38] <Applecannon63> grenade bombs
[4:47:44] <bruskiibru> Because she's fun to me lol
[4:47:46] <ZeroCount> She can come back, just take away the grenade
[4:47:50] <hamahiroyuki> fucking platypus. shit's wack man
[4:48:19] <Applecannon63> Just make Elphet play like a smup
[4:48:23] <LorcaNomad> Jam was in the first datamine and it would make sense if she's at least the last character this season
[4:48:23] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Platypus is such a cool, bizarre animal, evolution drunk that day.
[4:48:33] <+0dinpen> interesting to watch woolie slowly piece things together
[4:49:02] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1424943441079832577?s=19
[4:49:02] <%Helix_Snake> yo ram!
[4:49:03] <CarmineAcciai> @LorcaNomad Friend of mine took a package opener to Strive, Jam has a model in the files.
[4:49:20] <%Helix_Snake> so cool to see a new character at woolie vs strive
[4:49:30] <andre11dr> Jam would be a cool return
[4:49:33] <%Helix_Snake> even if I'm not the biggest ram fan
[4:49:45] <Applecannon63> Just have Elphet with straight forward bullets and have to upgrade her bullets and her super is a bomb
[4:49:48] <point4effort> Is the Jam model new or is it a leftover from Xrd, possibly during the testing phase?
[4:49:50] <andre11dr> Even tho Gio is very simular to Jam
[4:49:56] <LorcaNomad> It's so fun to watch people get it during a matchup/how to play a character
[4:50:03] <hamahiroyuki> but fr Australia's the first place to get fucked in order to get mad max in your fictional universe
[4:50:04] <blackkanye> @andre11dr Uh what/
[4:50:21] <bruskiibru> No Gio's not @andre11dr
[4:50:26] <andre11dr> Well they aren't the same
[4:50:27] <CarmineAcciai> @point4effort I'll ask him if it's the same as the Xrd model.
[4:50:43] <%Helix_Snake> "why is this allowed" because ram
[4:50:50] <hewlettfan96> Because black magic
[4:51:01] <yukichocomilk> I love playing ram LUL
[4:51:02] <hamahiroyuki> well bye for now, Imma get dinner
[4:51:04] <CarmineAcciai> Ram feels pretty high tier.
[4:51:10] <%townzzzzz> jam has her cards and moves for startes
[4:51:20] <%townzzzzz> starters*
[4:51:21] <+Parrish_broadnax> its called Privilege reggie
[4:51:23] <Applecannon63> Didn't one of the nations band together to form Ilyria while India just fucks off and make a land sized airship
[4:51:28] <+0dinpen> i know woolie doesnt care for people assuming his face expressions but gaddamn lol
[4:51:28] <%Helix_Snake> @CarmineAcciai yeah
[4:51:29] <andre11dr> But they have similarities, both are up close caracters opposing with buttons
[4:51:56] <ZeroCount> Gio is closer to Slayer than jam to me
[4:51:58] <WakeUpThrow> Ram in this is fucked up
[4:52:00] <%Helix_Snake> does woolie know he can 6p the 5s
[4:52:04] <andre11dr> Obviously Jam has more going on in terms of mechanics
[4:52:06] <ZeroCount> But she's kind of her own thing
[4:52:06] <CarmineAcciai> I do not know.
[4:52:22] <%Helix_Snake> that is the most critical ram mu knowledge
[4:52:27] <Shad0wTag> @applecannon63 not all of india. they got split in two. one thay believes in black tech and the other who stayed and went with magic as the future
[4:52:37] <WakeUpThrow> To me she's tied with Chipp in second place, tier wise
[4:52:39] <CarmineAcciai> Which one is the 5S, @Helix_Snake ?
[4:52:47] <%Helix_Snake> the big sword slash
[4:52:51] <CarmineAcciai> Gotcha.
[4:53:02] <%Helix_Snake> you can 6p the one on the ground
[4:53:04] <point4effort> Ram's most used button.
[4:53:14] <%Helix_Snake> it's how you force her to not win neutral at round start
[4:53:23] <%Helix_Snake> by just doing 5s
[4:53:36] <andre11dr> Ram probably has the best normals
[4:53:46] <%Helix_Snake> I mean sol's are pretty dang good
[4:53:47] <CarmineAcciai> I'd agree.
[4:53:55] <CarmineAcciai> Sol's are amazing, that said.
[4:53:57] <%Helix_Snake> ram sol and may all have amazing normals
[4:54:00] <andre11dr> But she can lose them which make it fair
[4:54:11] <WakeUpThrow> Sol's f.S is good, but his 6S, maaaaan
[4:54:17] <bruskiibru> I can understand why Nago players hate when they pop. That health is gone in an instant bro
[4:54:38] <CarmineAcciai> Yep.
[4:54:40] <point4effort> If you can keep high blood meter, nago is terrifying
[4:54:44] <andre11dr> I play Sol and i feel like Rams normals are better, i feel like they beat his more
[4:54:48] <%Helix_Snake> their health is gone in an instant AND it opens them up to a combo which will often just kill him
[4:54:50] <+EchoXOF> I'd argue Sol has the best normals, but Ram is up there
[4:55:01] <andre11dr> She has wierd hitboxes
[4:55:10] <CarmineAcciai> The other thing is high blood HEAVILY limits his routes and options though.
[4:55:31] <%Helix_Snake> Sol's normals build risk like fucking insanity, I swear the amount of risk they build is an accident
[4:55:37] <+0dinpen> LMAO reggie
[4:55:54] <andre11dr> Oh yeah, that's why he kills so fast
[4:55:57] <Shad0wTag> @helix_snake Daisuke's vision
[4:56:08] <%Helix_Snake> you get like half a bar of risk in 1 second
[4:56:08] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:56:16] <andre11dr> He ends matches in two combos if he gets the wall
[4:56:18] <yukichocomilk> nago`s normals are just as insane
[4:56:27] <CarmineAcciai> At high blood, yes.
[4:56:40] <andre11dr> It's like, why did that do so much?
[4:56:42] <yukichocomilk> he's just slower himself but the normals are just as good
[4:56:58] <+chief_chongo> i always whiff throws... everyone im fighting makes it look damn easy
[4:57:10] <CarmineAcciai> His HS/S have hella startup otherwise.
[4:57:43] <bruskiibru> @chief_chongo Don't worryLP
[4:57:58] <bruskiibru> Im on the same boat
[4:58:19] <+chief_chongo> main thing i need to work on is getting out of the corner
[4:58:39] <LorcaNomad> POGGERS
[4:58:43] <WakeUpThrow> nice
[4:58:54] <%AlteisenReiseZ> wool got the full triangle
[4:59:04] <%townzzzzz> he's entering the ZONE
[4:59:05] <andre11dr> Yeah feel like throws got buffet ut also nerfed, it's wierd
[4:59:05] <%Helix_Snake> @chief_chongo there's three reasons you'll whiff throws: 1. they're in the air, 2. they're too far, or 3. there in a situation where they're throw invuln (right after blockstun/wakeup)
[4:59:06] <CarmineAcciai> Getting out of the corner as Nago is a bastard.
[4:59:34] <%Helix_Snake> @CarmineAcciai getting out of the corner as anyone against ram is a bastard
[4:59:41] <hakumaribo> Reggie playing as Best Girl????
[4:59:47] <hakumaribo> best timeline
[4:59:52] <CarmineAcciai> Yeeeeah.
[5:00:00] <+chief_chongo> @chief_chongo i think my provlem is most in 3 tbh, i often have them close enough but i need to learn which situations people are invuln more. or the timing
[5:00:00] <CarmineAcciai> Ram is oppressive once she gets in the corner.
[5:00:07] <andre11dr> I feel like mashing throw out of trouble is not as easy at it used to be
[5:00:33] <%Helix_Snake> @andre11dr I mean I think meaties always beat throws
[5:00:39] <%Helix_Snake> but I don't know for sure
[5:00:50] <andre11dr> In +R you would just mash throw in wake up and it worked
[5:00:51] <NotHereToStream> it does
[5:01:01] <NotHereToStream> because the active frame is already beating the 2 frame start up
[5:01:09] <%Helix_Snake> @andre11dr I mean it works in strive against people who time their meaties bad
[5:01:56] <+chief_chongo> i love to see mortabato fail
[5:02:09] <andre11dr> I'm actually really surprised Reggie isn't just playing Sol
[5:02:27] <+Laycas49> why?
[5:02:27] <%Afterman_> sol is v fun
[5:02:30] <andre11dr> The one time the MC is broken, Reggie has nothing to do with it
[5:02:35] <WakeUpThrow> Seeing Ram lose in general here is SeemsGood
[5:02:43] <+chief_chongo> roofleRam roofleRam roofleRam
[5:02:43] <NotHereToStream> because sol isn't in barefeet
[5:02:52] <+chief_chongo> roofleRam roofleNagori
[5:03:03] <CarmineAcciai> If you have 50 meter on Nago, you can beat out Ram's Mortabato with Wasureyuki. Input while it's zooming in on her.
[5:03:06] <%townzzzzz> he's trying out other characters
[5:03:36] <+chief_chongo> are they both using fight stick?
[5:03:37] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[5:03:52] <NotHereToStream> woolie on DS5
[5:03:54] <Shad0wTag> @chief_chongo Woolie plays on controller
[5:03:58] <NotHereToStream> think reggie is on sticks
[5:04:23] <CarmineAcciai> I also rock a pad. It's what I had most of the time, but I long for the feel of an arcade panel.
[5:04:24] <+chief_chongo> i think certain characters on this feel better on pad and others better on stick
[5:04:51] <+chief_chongo> but generally im committed to transitioning to stick
[5:04:54] <CarmineAcciai> I mean, I would have nightmares doing Behemoth Typhoon on a Hitbox.
[5:05:01] <andre11dr> DS5 with Fighting games SabaPing
[5:05:37] <+chief_chongo> roofleNagorishake roofleNagorishake roofleNagorishake
[5:05:42] <andre11dr> That depad man not meant for FGs
[5:05:47] <+Laycas49> I just dread doing a behemoth typhoon
[5:05:58] <+chief_chongo> yeah i hear bad things about the DS5 dpad
[5:06:04] <ittalulu> "well then"
[5:06:21] <ZeroCount> RyuChamp
[5:06:41] <andre11dr> RyuChamp
[5:06:54] <ittalulu> snapcubeKeith
[5:07:25] <CarmineAcciai> The PS Dpad shreds my thumb trying to do anime fighter inputs on it.
[5:07:31] <%snausages_> BT on hitbox not so bad
[5:07:31] <CarmineAcciai> Husband SWEARS by it for Tekken though.
[5:07:34] <andre11dr> RyuChamp woolieGIRLS
[5:07:44] <+chief_chongo> just the normal ps4 controller was messing with my thumb hard so i decided to switch
[5:07:52] <+chief_chongo> but now my OTHER hand hurts
[5:08:04] <ittalulu> i wanna get a hitbox to save my thumbs tbh
[5:08:07] <%snausages_> i got a hitbox cause controllers were making me salty, had it just over a week and rly like it
[5:08:16] <%snausages_> but ringer finger inputs weak
[5:08:25] <+Parrish_broadnax> the answer, was no
[5:08:26] <+Parrish_broadnax> lol
[5:08:27] <NotHereToStream> LUL
[5:08:29] <+chief_chongo> yeah ring and pink weak
[5:08:40] <andre11dr> I liked the FS4 depad ,it's what i use for fighting games
[5:08:51] <%snausages_> sometimes I cross ppl up deliberartly so I can input super on the side I'm strong on lol
[5:08:54] <ittalulu> hey, just two more fingers is a lot
[5:08:56] <+chief_chongo> right now dash macro is on the 4th on my top row and its not working some of the time
[5:09:05] <+chief_chongo> not sure if its my weak finger or timing
[5:09:08] <andre11dr> But that DS5 one ,no thanks, it feels wrong
[5:09:16] <CarmineAcciai> I've been working on getting better on weak side.
[5:09:33] <+Parrish_broadnax> fair, I dont mind the DPad on the Duelsense but I really only got it for Type C charging
[5:10:17] <andre11dr> Tekken for me just plays better on a controller
[5:10:17] <+0dinpen> oooo
